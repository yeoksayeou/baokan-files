Black people in the largest city of Kentucky, Louisville, bravely fought against police brutality for two consecutive nights despite the savage suppression by over 2,000 military police. They protested against the reactionary authorities' tolerance and protection of a fascist police officer who illegally beat a black person. This officer had brutally beaten a black person on May 17, sparking great outrage among the black community. The police authorities had to feign concern and temporarily remove him from duty, but within ten days, they reinstated him, allowing him to continue his oppression of black people. On May 27, fueled by anger, black people took to the streets to hold a protest rally. They attacked the police with glass bottles, bricks, stones, and sticks, and overturned and set fire to a police car. Black snipers also fired shots at the police from rooftops.

To intensify the suppression of the black people's resistance, the reactionary authorities declared a curfew on May 27, mobilizing over 700 police officers for enhanced security, and also deployed 700 fully armed National Guardsmen. On May 28, the reactionary authorities sent an additional 400-500 National Guardsmen for suppression. Enraged black people engaged in an even more intense battle with the military police. They threw bricks and stones at the military police and fired shots from rooftops or cars. Black youth fearlessly confronted the National Guardsmen and police, cursing them to their faces. The black community, defying the curfew, threw Molotov cocktails at white supremacist stores and important buildings in the city, causing 30 major fires. This left the police and firefighters overwhelmed and exhausted.

During these two days, 275 people were unlawfully arrested by the reactionary authorities.

The reactionary ruling authorities are extremely anxious about the black people's armed resistance in this city, fearing that the struggle will further escalate. They have ordered more National Guardsmen to prepare for battle, ready to carry out even more brutal suppression.

    美国肯塔基州黑人奋起抗暴反对种族歧视
    连续两晚同反动警察英勇搏斗，黑人狙击手打得敌人狼狈不堪
    新华社二十九日讯  华盛顿消息：美国肯塔基州最大的城市路易斯维尔的黑人，不顾两千多名军警的残暴镇压，在二十七日、二十八日接连两个晚上进行武力抗暴斗争，抗议反动当局纵容包庇一名非法毒打黑人的法西斯警官。这名警官曾在五月十七日蛮横毒打一名黑人，引起黑人群众的极大愤慨。警察当局曾不得不假惺惺地解除他的职务，然而不出十天又给他复职，让他继续迫害黑人。为此，黑人群众二十七日怀着满腔的愤怒在街头举行抗议集会，并且用玻璃瓶、砖头、石块和棍棒袭击前来镇压他们的警察。他们翻倒、并且放火烧毁了一辆警车。黑人狙击手还从屋顶上向警察开枪。
    反动统治当局为了加强对黑人的抗暴斗争的镇压，在二十七日除了宣布宵禁，倾巢出动七百多名警察加强警戒外，还调集了七百名全副武装的国民警卫队。二十八日，反动当局又增派了四五百名国民警卫队进行镇压。愤怒的黑人同反动军警展开了一场更激烈的战斗。他们向军警投掷砖头、石块，从屋顶上或汽车里向军警开枪。黑人青年不畏强暴，在街上当面怒骂国民警卫队和警察。黑人群众还不顾戒严令，向在城区的白人种族主义者的商店和重要建筑物投掷燃烧瓶，共引起三十处大火，弄得警察和消防队员焦头烂额，疲于奔命。
    在这两天中，共二百七十五人遭到了反动当局的无理逮捕。
    反动统治当局对于这个城市掀起的黑人武力抗暴斗争十分恐慌，担心黑人斗争会进一步扩大。它已命令更多的国民警卫队作好战斗准备，以便进行更加残暴的镇压。
