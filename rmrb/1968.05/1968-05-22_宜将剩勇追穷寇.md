Under the guidance of the "May 16th Circular" personally drafted by Chairman Mao in 1966, the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories.

Looking back at the two-year battle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we clearly recognize that the handful of top capitalist-roaders within the Party, such as Liu Shaoqi, represent the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. These scoundrels have infiltrated our Party, waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, attempting to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism. They are the most dangerous enemies of the proletariat under socialist conditions. Our struggle against them is a sharp, complex, and life-and-death struggle. Therefore, we must never relax our vigilance against them.

Over the years, in our struggle against American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, we have formed an important concept: as Chairman Mao has long taught us, "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In essence, they are reactionary through and through." During the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, American imperialism, relying on its so-called "superiority" in the sea and air, was arrogant and aggressive. The revolutionary fervor of the Chinese People's Volunteers, under the brilliant command of the great leader Chairman Mao, dared to fight and dared to win, exposing the true nature of the American paper tiger and forcing it to sign the armistice agreement. Today, in our struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders, traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionary two-faced characters within the Party, we must, as we did in the past when we fought against American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, carry forward the spirit of continuous battle, relentlessly pursue and attack the fleeing enemy, giving the class enemy no chance to catch their breath, and resolutely overthrow and expose them politically, ideologically, and theoretically. We must carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a thorough victory.

    宜将剩勇追穷寇
    空军一级战斗英雄　张积慧
    在毛主席亲自主持制定的一九六六年五月十六日《通知》的指引下，史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性的胜利。
    回顾两年来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，使我们清楚地认识到，中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派，是代表国民党反动派利益，代表帝国主义、资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右利益的反革命黑帮。这些家伙，钻到了我们党里，打着“红旗”反红旗，妄图颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。他们是社会主义条件下无产阶级最危险的敌人。我们同他们的斗争是一场尖锐、复杂的、你死我活的斗争。因此，我们决不能放松对他们的警惕性。
    多年来，我们在同美帝国主义和国民党反动派的斗争中形成了一条重要的概念，这就是毛主席早就教导我们的：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”在抗美援朝战争中，美帝国主义依仗他的所谓海空“优势”，张牙舞爪，反革命气焰何等嚣张。我们中国人民志愿军在伟大统帅毛主席的英明指挥下，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，戳穿了美帝这只纸老虎的原形，迫使他不得不低下头来在停战协定上签字。今天，我们在和党内一小撮走资派、叛徒、特务、反革命两面派作斗争的时候，也必须和当年痛打美帝国主义和国民党反动派一样，发扬连续作战的精神，穷追猛打落水狗，不给阶级敌人以任何喘息的机会，坚决把他们从政治上、思想上、理论上斗倒斗臭，批深批透，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
