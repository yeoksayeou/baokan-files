A Lao friend, on the occasion of the second anniversary of the issuance of the CCP Central Committee's "Notice" on May 16, 1966, said that this is a great and precious historical document. He pointed out: "Chairman Mao has developed Marxism-Leninism and solved a series of major issues regarding the defense and consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the prevention of capitalist restoration. This is the third milestone in the history of the development of Marxism."

He said: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao personally has exposed and overthrown the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated into the Party, the government, the army, and the cultural sphere in China, with China's Khrushchev as their chief. This has completely foiled the schemes of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries to restore capitalism in China, ensuring that China will forever remain red. This is a great victory."

He said: "Modern revisionism advocates the 'party of the whole people' and the 'state of the whole people,' claiming that there are no classes and class struggles under socialist conditions. This is a self-deceiving and deceiving lie. The fact that the Khrushchev revisionist clique emerged in the Soviet Union and the fierce class struggle in the Chinese Cultural Revolution has shattered the lies of the revisionists. We must revolutionize, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, understand Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and never forget class struggle, never relax vigilance."

He said, "The oppressed peoples and oppressed nations, after achieving revolutionary success, must continue to revolutionize and advance, so as to ensure that the power remains in the hands of the revolutionary people. We must recognize that the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie ultimately boils down to a power issue. We must heed Chairman Mao's words: 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,' and always keep our guns in hand."

This Lao friend emphasized that Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat has universal and great significance. He said: "The revolutionary ideas contained in the 'Notice' personally drafted by Chairman Mao have raised the revolutionary struggle theory of the revolutionary people of the world, inspired their fighting will, enabled them to see far and wide. More and more people have come to realize that to make a revolution, one must study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the developed Marxism-Leninism. It can be believed that when the people of the world are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, it will be the time for the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries to be thoroughly defeated."

    老挝一位朋友热烈赞颂中共中央《通知》是伟大的历史文件
    毛泽东思想是马克思主义发展史上的第三个里程碑
    世界人民用毛泽东思想武装起来之日，就是帝修反彻底完蛋之时
    新华社康开十七日电　一位老挝朋友在中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》发表两周年的时候发表谈话说，这是一篇伟大的宝贵的历史文件。他指出：“毛主席发展了马克思列宁主义，解决了保卫和巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟的一系列重大问题。这是马克思主义发展史上的第三个里程碑。”
    他说：“毛主席亲自领导的伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的混进中国党里、政府里、军队里和文化领域的资产阶级代表人物揪了出来，并把他们打翻在地。这就使帝、修、反妄图在中国复辟资本主义的阴谋彻底破产，保证了中国永远不会改变鲜红的颜色。这是一个伟大的胜利。”
    他说：“现代修正主义鼓吹‘全民党’、‘全民国家’，胡说什么在社会主义条件下已经没有阶级和阶级斗争，这是自欺欺人的鬼话。在苏联出现了赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团和中国文化大革命中激烈的阶级斗争的事实，粉碎了修正主义者的谎言。我们要革命，就要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，要领会毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，千万不要忘记阶级斗争，千万不可松懈警惕。”
    他说，“被压迫人民、被压迫民族在获得革命成功之后，还要不断革命，不断前进，才能确保政权永远掌握在革命人民手中。我们要认识到无产阶级和资产阶级的斗争，归根结底是一个政权问题。我们要听毛主席的话：‘枪杆子里面出政权’，永远握紧手中枪。”
    这位老挝朋友强调指出，毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论，具有普遍的伟大意义。他说：“毛主席亲自主持制定的《通知》的革命思想，提高了世界革命人民的革命斗争理论，鼓舞了他们的斗争意志，使他们站得高，看得远。越来越多的人已经认识到，要干革命，必须活学活用毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是发展了的马克思列宁主义。可以相信，当世界人民用毛泽东思想武装起来之日，就是帝、修、反彻底完蛋之时。”
