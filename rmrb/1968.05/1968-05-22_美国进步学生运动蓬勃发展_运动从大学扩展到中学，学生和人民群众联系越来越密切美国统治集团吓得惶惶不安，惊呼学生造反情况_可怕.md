The progressive student movement in the United States is continuing to develop. Not only have new struggles erupted in many universities, but large numbers of high school students are rapidly being drawn into the struggle. The connection between students and the masses is also becoming increasingly close.

On May 17, more than 6,000 students at the University of California, Berkeley, held a rally on campus to oppose the Vietnam War and to support 866 students who had signed a pledge not to fight in South Vietnam. These 866 students collectively read their pledge at the rally. In their pledge, they pointed out that the U.S. imperialist war in Vietnam is "unjust" and expressed their refusal to serve in the military. Their words were met with enthusiastic applause from the entire audience, expressing firm support. The reactionary authorities in the United States were very uneasy about the University of California students' actions against the Vietnam War. California Governor Reagan ordered the university president, Hitch, to ban the rally. However, Hitch, intimidated by the power of the student movement, dared not carry out the ban.

On the same evening, in New York, the largest city in the United States, a group of students from Columbia University and residents of Manhattan, with the support of more than 1,000 students from Columbia University, Yale University, and the City University of New York, bravely occupied a building at Columbia University, demanding that the school cancel its plan to seize land in Manhattan.

On the evening of the 17th, more than 400 students at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, occupied the administrative building of the school, demanding that the school sever ties with the Chase Manhattan Bank because the bank supports South African apartheid. In addition, the University of Delaware, Delaware State University, Florida State University, Idaho State University, Marquette University, and the University of Miami have recently seen student struggles of varying scales.

At the same time, the progressive student movement in the United States is rapidly expanding into high schools. According to reports, in recent periods, there have been over 200 to 300 school walkouts in Chicago's high schools. Chicago Mayor Daley was so anxious that he exclaimed, "The situation is terrible." In Cincinnati, six out of eight high schools have seen sit-ins. In late April, 100,000 high school students in New York City went on strike to participate in the just struggle against the Vietnam War.

Faced with the thriving progressive student movement in the United States, the ruling class is extremely anxious. The mouthpiece of the U.S. monopoly capitalists, "U.S. News & World Report," recently exclaimed, "This is an era of constant turmoil and rebellion in American colleges and universities," "Chaos and rebellion are spreading from universities to middle and high schools across the United States." FBI Director Hoover recently remarked that the development of the student movement in the United States over the past few months has a "subversive" nature, "Their danger is enormous."

    美国进步学生运动蓬勃发展
    运动从大学扩展到中学，学生和人民群众联系越来越密切美国统治集团吓得惶惶不安，惊呼学生造反情况“可怕”
    据新华社二十日讯　华盛顿消息：美国的进步学生运动正继续向前发展。不但在许多大学里爆发了新的斗争，而且大批大批中学生迅速地卷入斗争的浪潮，学生和人民群众的联系也越来越密切。
    五月十七日，美国西海岸伯克利市加利福尼亚大学六千余名学生在校内举行反对侵越战争的大会，支持这个大学八百六十六名学生签名宣誓决不在南越打仗。这八百六十六名学生在会场上集体宣读了他们的誓言。他们在誓言中指出，美帝侵越战争是“非正义的”，并表示拒服兵役。他们的这些话受到了全场热烈鼓掌，表示坚决支持。美国反动当局对加利福尼亚大学学生的反对侵越战争的行动十分不安。加利福尼亚州州长里根下令要加利福尼亚大学校长希契禁止这次集会。但是希契慑于学生运动的威力，不敢执行这个禁令。
    同日晚，在美国第一大城市纽约，哥伦比亚大学的一部分学生和曼哈顿区的居民，在一千余名哥伦比亚大学、耶鲁大学和市立纽约学院学生的支持下，英勇地占领了哥伦比亚大学的一座建筑，要求校方废除侵占曼哈顿区土地的计划。
    十七日晚，威斯康星州麦迪逊市威斯康星大学的四百余名学生占领了这个学校的行政大楼，要求学校同大通银行断绝关系，因为这个银行支持南非种族主义者。此外，特拉华州立学院，特拉华大学，佛罗里达州立大学，爱达荷州立大学，马克特大学，迈阿密大学等最近都爆发了规模不等的学生斗争。
    在这同时，美国的进步学生运动正在迅速地扩展到中学。据报道，最近一个时期，芝加哥市的中学里就发生过二、三百起罢课，芝加哥市市长戴利急得直叫情况“可怕”。在辛辛那提市，八所中学中的六所爆发了静坐示威。纽约市十万中学生四月底还曾经罢课，参加反对侵越战争的正义斗争。
    面对着美国进步学生运动蓬勃发展的局势，美国统治集团十分惊慌不安。美国垄断资产阶级的喉舌《美国新闻与世界报道》最近惊呼，“这是美国大专学校里骚乱和造反不断高涨的时代”，“混乱和叛乱正从大学向全美国的中小学扩展中”。美国联邦调查局长胡佛最近惊叹，这几个月来美国学生运动的发展，具有“颠覆”的性质，“它们的危险性是巨大的”。
