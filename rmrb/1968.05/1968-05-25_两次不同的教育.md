After becoming a member of the revolutionary committee, the masses twice told me, "You have become an 'official,' don't forget us." These two similar statements gave me two different but profound lessons.

Once, two grassroots organizations had a dispute, and they both came to me to resolve the issue. At that time, based on my understanding, the side that was originally in the same organization as me indeed had shortcomings, so I criticized them. The next day, I had a heart-to-heart talk with a comrade from this organization. He complained to me, "You have become an 'official,' don't forget us." At that time, I told him that we should remember the words of Li Wenzhong, the model for supporting the left and loving the people, and be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. I am a member of the district revolutionary committee, and if you have shortcomings, I should criticize and help you; if other mass organizations have shortcomings, I should also criticize and help them; if I have shortcomings or mistakes, you should also criticize and help me. Only then can we truly care for, love, and help each other. After the talk, this comrade gradually calmed down and even voluntarily made a self-criticism the next day. From this incident, I realized that to maintain close ties with the masses, we must overcome bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and use Mao Zedong Thought to do a good job of ideological work among the masses.

Another time, after studying Chairman Mao's teachings on "being both an 'official' and a common person," we returned to our units to participate in production labor. The masses saw me and said, "You have become an 'official,' don't forget us." The masses' words truly hit the mark. Reflecting on the previous period, I always emphasized being busy with work and did not go among the masses. Now, I realize that not participating in production labor is the beginning of alienation from the masses. From then on, I made a firm decision to regularly participate in labor every week. The masses became closer to me and began to share their hearts with me. They said I was still an ordinary worker and hoped that I would always be a genuine servant of the people. This incident made me deeply realize that representatives of the revolutionary masses must never be aloof; they should always act as ordinary laborers, working, studying, and living with the masses.

    两次不同的教育
    江苏省无锡市北塘区革命委员会委员　戎金根
    我当了革命委员会委员以后，群众先后两次对我说：“你做了‘官’了，不要忘记了我们。”这两次内容相同的话，使我受到了两次不同的深刻的教育。
    一次，基层两个群众组织发生了争执，他们都来找我解决问题。当时，根据我的了解，原来与我同一个组织的一方确有缺点，我就批评了他们。第二天，我又和这个组织的一位同志谈心。他埋怨我为什么不替他们讲话。他说：“你做了‘官’了，不要忘记了我们。”当时，我对他说，我们应该记住支左爱民模范李文忠同志的话，无限忠于毛主席。我是一个区的革委会委员，你有缺点，我应该批评帮助，其他群众组织有缺点，我也要批评帮助；我有缺点、错误，你们同样要批评帮助我；这才是真正的互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。经过谈心，这个同志慢慢心平气和了，第二天还主动作了检查。从这件事情上，我认识到，要密切联系群众，就要克服资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，用毛泽东思想去做好群众的思想工作。
    又一次，我们学习了毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，回本单位参加生产劳动。群众见了我说：“你做了‘官’了，不要忘记了我们。”群众的话，真是一针见血地戳到了我的心上。回想前一段时间，自己总是强调工作忙，没有到群众中去。现在，我认识到，不参加生产劳动，就是脱离群众的开始。从此，我下定决心，坚持每周定期参加劳动。群众和我亲近了，也跟我讲知心话了。他们说我还是一个普通工人，希望我永远做一个名副其实的人民勤务员。这件事，使我深刻地认识到：革命群众的代表，千万不能高高在上，应该始终以一个普通劳动者的身份，同群众劳动在一起，学习在一起，生活在一起。
