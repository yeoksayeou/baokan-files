Palestinian guerrillas have recently ambushed Israeli invaders for the first time in the Sinai Peninsula, which is occupied by Israel, opening a new battlefield against the enemy. At the same time, they have launched a series of attacks in other areas, achieving many new victories.

On May 9, Cairo newspapers detailed the battle in which the guerrillas ambushed Israeli invaders in the Sinai Peninsula. On the morning of May 7, in the Romani area west of Al-Arish, the guerrillas used landmines to destroy an Israeli tank, killing three Israeli soldiers and wounding one. A second tank sent to the explosion site also hit a landmine, wounding six Israeli soldiers.

The headquarters of the "Storm" commando unit, affiliated with the Palestinian nationalist organization "Fatah," issued a battle report in Cairo on May 11. The report stated that the "Storm" commando unit launched several attacks on enemy military camps and patrols in the villages of Al-Aqsa, Manara, and the Gamal region on the west bank of the Jordan River on May 7 and 8. They killed twenty Israeli soldiers and officers, wounded eight, destroyed nine enemy military vehicles, one oil depot, and several military facilities.

According to reports, on the night of May 7, the Palestinian guerrillas launched simultaneous attacks on the enemy in several areas. In the village of Yusuf, the guerrillas fought with Israeli invaders for two hours, killing and wounding thirty enemy soldiers. The Israeli invaders dispatched helicopters, but to no avail. In Kafr Luba, the guerrillas killed ten enemy soldiers and raised the Palestinian flag in that area. The guerrillas also launched a surprise attack on the Israeli military outpost in Adot Yakup. After a forty-minute battle, they killed and wounded more than ten enemy soldiers and destroyed one enemy military vehicle. That night, the guerrillas operated in the suburbs of Jerusalem, causing the panicked Israeli invaders to declare a curfew in the suburbs of Jerusalem.

Foreign news agencies admitted that the guerrillas' battles within the Israeli-occupied areas were highly organized and conducted under a unified operational plan.

"Fatah" issued another battle report recently, stating that on May 2, the guerrillas used landmines to destroy two enemy armored vehicles and one half-track vehicle south of the Dead Sea, killing and wounding thirty-five Israeli soldiers. On May 3, the guerrillas engaged in a fierce battle with Israeli invaders on the west bank of the Jordan River using mortars and other weapons, lasting one and a half hours, killing and wounding many enemy soldiers.

The guerrillas have also launched attacks in the Gaza Strip recently, killing nine Israeli soldiers and destroying many enemy military vehicles.

Palestinian people demonstrate against U.S. imperialism and its lackey Israel's armed aggression against Arab countries.

    新华社十四日讯　巴勒斯坦游击队最近在被以色列侵占的阿联的西奈半岛上第一次伏击了以色列侵略者，开辟了打击敌人的新战场。与此同时，他们在其他地区向以色列侵略者发动了一系列袭击，取得了许多新的胜利。
    五月九日，开罗的报纸详细报道了游击队在西奈半岛伏击以色列侵略者的战斗经过。七日清晨，在阿里什以西的罗曼尼地区，游击队用地雷炸毁了一辆以色列的坦克，打死以色列侵略军三名，打伤一名。驶往爆炸地点的敌人的第二辆坦克也触了地雷，六名以色列侵略军被炸伤。
    巴勒斯坦民族主义组织“法塔赫”所属的军事组织“暴风”突击队总司令部十一日在开罗发表的战报说，“暴风”突击队于五月七日和八日向约旦河西岸的阿克萨村、马纳拉村和加迈尔地区的敌军营地和巡逻队发动了几次袭击，打死以色列侵略军官兵二十名，打伤八名，炸毁敌人军车九辆、油库一座和若干军事设施。
    据报道，巴勒斯坦游击队五月七日晚，在不少地区同时向敌人发起进攻。在优素福村，游击队和以色列侵略者激战两小时，打死打伤敌军三十名，以色列侵略者出动了直升飞机也无济于事。在克法鲁平，游击队打死敌军十名，并在那个地区升起了巴勒斯坦的旗帜。游击队还奇袭了阿多特·雅库普的以色列侵略军的据点，经过四十分钟的战斗，打死打伤敌军十多名，击毁敌人军车一辆。当天晚上，游击队在耶路撒冷的郊区进行活动，惊慌失措的以色列侵略者不得不连夜宣布在耶路撒冷郊区实行戒严。
    外国通讯社承认，游击队在以色列占领区内的战斗有着高度的组织性，这些战斗是在一个统一的作战计划指导下进行的。
      “法塔赫”在不久前发表的另一个战报说，五月二日，游击队在死海以南用地雷炸毁了敌人两辆装甲车和一辆半履带战车，车上的三十五名以色列侵略军被炸死炸伤。五月三日，游击队又在约旦河西岸用迫击炮等武器和以色列侵略军激战了一个半小时，杀伤了许多敌人。
    游击队最近在加沙地带也发动了袭击，打死以色列侵略军九名，击毁敌人多辆军车。（附图片）
