In the first ten days of May, the daily coal production and daily mining progress increased by an average of 9% and 15.7% respectively compared to the same period last month; the daily stripping volume of the open-pit mine increased by 22.5% compared to the same period last month.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 15th: Under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the broad revolutionary workers of the Fuxin Mining Bureau in Liaoning Province have firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching to "never forget class struggle," and have vigorously carried out class struggle, deeply and persistently launched a revolutionary criticism, and continuously pushed the revolution and production forward. Now, all factories and mines in the entire mining area have established revolutionary committees, and production is booming, with each month surpassing the last.

Fuxin Coal Mine is one of the important coal production bases in Liaoning Province. The broad revolutionary workers here have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasped the direction of struggle, and used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to launch a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and his local agents. Throughout the bureau, from the surface to the underground, from the production site to the workers' dormitories, a massive people's war to criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev has been launched, criticizing the "technology first," "expert line," "money as the commander," and "material incentive" and other revisionist junk. Recently, the broad revolutionary workers have studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, as well as Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, and in connection with the current class struggle, they have severely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "class struggle extinction," further enhancing their class struggle consciousness. The broad revolutionary workers, with high morale, have taken the initiative to launch a new attack on the enemies of the proletariat, smashing the conspiracy of a handful of enemies to sabotage the revolution, sabotage production, and reverse the case.

The revolutionary workers in the mining area have earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and insisted on using revolution to lead production. The revolutionary cadres and miners of each factory and mine work together, study and apply Chairman Mao's works together, and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev together, uniting as one to make production rise day by day. Especially since May, the production of each factory and mine has seen a significant increase. According to statistics, from May 1st to 9th, the daily coal production and daily mining progress of the entire mining area increased by an average of 9% and 15.7% respectively compared to the same period last month; the daily stripping volume of the open-pit mine increased by 22.5% compared to the same period last month. In the mass movement of grasping revolution and promoting production, some advanced units have emerged. The Ping'an Coal Mine has completed its tasks over quota every month since this year, and in the first ten days of May, it has produced more than 6,000 tons of coal for the state, becoming a red flag in the entire mining area. Many grassroots units have also launched socialist labor competitions of learning from each other, helping each other, and catching up with each other, with good people and good deeds emerging continuously.

    批臭反革命修正主义黑货  提高革命职工阶级觉悟
    阜新煤矿生产一月胜过一月
    五月上旬，煤炭日产量和日掘进进度比上月同期分别平均提高百分之九和百分之十五点七；露天矿的日剥离量比上月同期提高百分之二十二点五
    据新华社沈阳十五日电　辽宁省阜新矿务局广大革命职工，在人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，不断地把革命和生产推向前进，各方面工作都出现了新的气象。现在，全矿区所有的厂矿都成立了革命委员会，生产蒸蒸日上，一月胜过一月。
    阜新煤矿是辽宁省的重要煤炭生产基地之一。这个矿区的广大革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在当地的代理人发动了猛烈进攻。全局上下，从井上到井下，从生产现场到工人宿舍区，开展了一场声势浩大的狠批中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的人民战争，批判了“技术第一”、“专家路线”、“金钱挂帅”和“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货。最近，广大革命职工学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，以及毛主席的一系列最新指示，并联系当前阶级斗争的实际，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，进一步提高了阶级斗争观念。广大革命职工以昂扬的斗志，主动地向无产阶级的敌人发起了新的进攻，粉碎了一小撮敌人妄图破坏革命、破坏生产和进行翻案的阴谋活动。
    矿区的广大革命职工认真贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，坚持用革命统帅生产。各厂矿的革命领导干部和矿工们一起参加劳动，一起活学活用毛主席著作，一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫，上下拧成一股绳，使生产日日上升。特别是五月份以来，各厂矿的生产又有很大提高。据统计，从五月一日到九日，整个矿区的煤炭日产量和日掘进进度比上月同期分别平均提高百分之九和百分之十五点七；露天矿的日剥离量比上月同期提高百分之二十二点五。在抓革命促生产的群众运动中，出现了一些先进单位。平安煤矿在今年以来，月月超额完成任务，在五月上旬已给国家多生产了六千多吨煤炭，成为全矿区的一面红旗。很多基层单位还开展比、学、赶、帮的社会主义劳动竞赛，好人好事不断涌现。
