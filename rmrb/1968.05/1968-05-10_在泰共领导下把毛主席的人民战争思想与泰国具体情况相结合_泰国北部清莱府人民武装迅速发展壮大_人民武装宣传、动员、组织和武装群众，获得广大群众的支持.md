In the northern Thai province of Chiang Rai, people's armed forces have rapidly developed and grown stronger under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party by combining Mao Zedong's thoughts on people's war with Thailand's specific conditions. The people's armed forces have propagated, mobilized, organized, and armed the masses, gaining the support of the broad masses of the people.

	New China News Agency, May 9th: The radio station "Voice of the Thai People" on May 8th published a commentary stating that in the northern Thai province of Chiang Rai, under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, the people's armed forces have combined Mao Zedong's thoughts on people's war with Thailand's specific conditions, rapidly developing and growing stronger, achieving brilliant victories in battles.

	The commentary said that the people of Chiang Rai began their revolutionary armed struggle in the district of Thoen on May 8th of last year. The people's armed forces of Chiang Rai have continuously developed and grown stronger in their fierce struggle against the Thanom-Kittikachorn reactionary clique. Currently, the flames of armed struggle have spread from the district of Thoen to the districts of Chiang Kham, Chiang Saen, Chiang Khong, and Phrae. The commentary said that according to preliminary statistics, in the past year, the people's armed forces of Chiang Rai have engaged in 53 battles with the enemy, annihilating over 150 enemy personnel.

	The commentary said that the people's armed forces of Chiang Rai have actively applied Mao Zedong Thought, demonstrating the immense power of people's war, and continuously achieving victories. In February of this year, the people's armed forces of Chiang Kham shot down an enemy helicopter, annihilating all 14 enemy personnel on board. At the end of April, the people's armed forces of Chiang Khong bravely attacked two fake police stations, killing 15 enemy personnel and wounding many more, seizing a large amount of weapons and ammunition, and burning down the fake police stations.

	The commentary said that the people's armed forces of Chiang Rai follow Mao Zedong's teachings: "Revolutionary war is the people's war. Only by mobilizing the people can we wage war, and only by relying on the people can we wage war." They dispatch armed propaganda teams to go deep among the people, carrying out revolutionary propaganda, mobilizing, organizing, and arming the masses. Because the people's armed forces and the masses are united, they have gained the strong support of the people, thus standing unshakable, continuously smashing the enemy's counter-revolutionary "extermination" campaigns, and achieving brilliant results.

	The commentary finally emphasized that the Thai people, by persisting in people's war, will definitely defeat American imperialism and the Thai reactionaries, achieving ultimate victory.

    新华社九日讯　“泰国人民之声”电台八日发表评论指出，泰国北部清莱府人民武装，在泰国共产党领导下，把毛主席关于人民战争的思想与泰国的具体情况相结合，使人民武装迅速发展壮大，在战斗中取得了辉煌的胜利。
    评论说，清莱府人民是从去年五月八日在汤恩县开始进行革命武装斗争的。清莱府人民武装在同他侬—巴博反动集团进行激烈的斗争中不断发展壮大。目前，武装斗争的烈火已经从汤恩县扩展到清堪、清盛、清孔和磅县等地区。评论说，据初步统计，一年来，清莱府人民武装同敌人进行了五十三次战斗，共歼灭敌人一百五十多人。
    评论说，清莱府人民武装活学活用毛泽东思想，发挥了人民战争的无比威力，不断取得胜利。今年二月间，清堪县人民武装打下了一架敌人的直升飞机，机上的十四名敌人全部被消灭。四月底，清孔县人民武装英勇地袭击了两个伪警察署，打死敌人十五名，打伤多名，缴获了大批武器、弹药，并且烧毁了伪警察署。
    评论说，清莱府人民武装遵循毛主席的教导：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”他们派遣武装宣传队深入群众，进行革命宣传、动员、组织群众和武装群众。由于人民武装和群众打成一片，获得了群众的大力支持，因此他们立于不败之地，不断粉碎敌人的反革命“围剿”，取得辉煌战果。
    评论最后强调指出，泰国人民坚持人民战争，就一定能打败美帝国主义和泰国反动派，取得最后胜利。
