The revolutionary committee has been established. How can we fully mobilize the enthusiasm of revolutionary cadres and mass organization leaders who have not been integrated? The method adopted by the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of a certain unit of the PLA stationed in the Ping'an Coal Mine of the Fuxin Mining Bureau and the mine's revolutionary committee is: to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes for these two groups of comrades, and to carry out heart-to-heart talks and home visits, inspiring them to support the work of the revolutionary committee with their boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, and to help the revolutionary committee exercise power in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought.

The Ping'an Coal Mine Revolutionary Committee, established in March this year, due to the limitation of quotas and other reasons, only absorbed a part of the revolutionary cadres and leaders of mass organizations. Some revolutionary cadres and leaders of mass organizations did not enter the revolutionary committee. Among them, the majority of comrades remember Chairman Mao's great teachings of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, do not consider their personal status, and actively and voluntarily help the revolutionary committee in its work. However, there are also some people who, because of the "self" factor, think: "I rebelled against the capitalist roaders earlier and have greater achievements. Some members of the revolutionary committee are not as good as I am." "I stood out early, but I was not integrated into the three-in-one combination, which means the masses do not trust me, and the higher authorities have reservations about me." Therefore, they have produced feelings of discontent, resentment, and discouragement, which have had a negative impact on the revolution and production. After discovering this problem, the propaganda team conducted repeated discussions and studies. Everyone agreed that these revolutionary cadres and leaders of mass organizations who have not been integrated generally have a certain amount of experience in class struggle. After more than a year of tempering in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, their class consciousness and consciousness of line struggle have both been raised. They are a group of backbone forces for seizing the revolution and promoting production, and their revolutionary enthusiasm must be fully mobilized.

To mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of this group of comrades, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and the mine's revolutionary committee held Mao Zedong Thought study classes for them. In the study classes, they organized everyone to repeatedly study the "Three Constantly Read Articles," study Chairman Mao's great teachings of "Communist Party members are not to seek official positions but to make revolution," take the three brilliant examples as models, take "completely" and "thoroughly" as the standard, take the two "extremes" as the measure, thoroughly criticize the "self" factor, and thoroughly establish the "public" factor.

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, in response to the fact that some leaders of mass organizations were not satisfied with some members of the revolutionary committee, studied in the classes with everyone Chairman Mao's teachings on how to correctly treat oneself, studied Vice Chairman Lin's instructions of "definitely jumping out of one's own range and not just seeing oneself," and vigorously publicized the great victories achieved by the great leader Chairman Mao in leading the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Everyone realized that all the achievements we have made should be attributed to the great leader Chairman Mao and to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and are not the personal merits of any revolutionary cadre or leader of a mass organization. Huang Xiangui, the head of the mine's "Joint Planning Committee," made a certain contribution in the Cultural Revolution by rebelling against the capitalist roaders within the party together with everyone. This time he was not selected into the revolutionary committee and felt a bit confused. After studying, he deeply felt that the purpose of the revolution is not to seek personal official positions but to prevent the restoration of capitalism and to prevent the country from changing color. One should not be arrogant about one's achievements but should be humble and prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, develop one's strengths, overcome one's weaknesses, and revolutionize to the end. Only in this way can one be boundlessly loyal to Chairman Mao and achieve new merits for the people in the new struggle.

In response to the resentment of some revolutionary cadres who were not included in the revolutionary three-in-one leadership team, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teachings of "carrying out heart-to-heart talks, this method is very good," carried out extensive heart-to-heart talks in the study classes, and did extensive and in-depth ideological and political work. During the talks, they first studied with these comrades Chairman Mao's quotations: "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party, these are two fundamental principles. If we doubt these two principles, then we can accomplish nothing." They helped them firmly believe in the masses and the Party, and helped them establish the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people. Chen Yongliang, the former deputy mine manager, is an old worker who suffered greatly in the old society. He is old now and was not integrated this time. At that time, he saw that the former mine manager and another deputy mine manager had joined the revolutionary three-in-one leadership team, and he felt a bit resentful. Li Shusen, a comrade from the propaganda team that came to support the left, had multiple heart-to-heart talks with him, and together they recalled bitterness and sweetness, raising his class consciousness. In the study class, he deeply excavated the root of his resentment. He said: "Resentment must be thoroughly overcome, otherwise one cannot love and support the revolutionary committee, and even more cannot be boundlessly loyal to Chairman Mao, boundlessly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and boundlessly loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line." Others also received education from Chen Yongliang's self-criticism. They said: We must, with our boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, actively support the newly born revolutionary committee!

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team also analyzed the discouragement of some people who were not included in the revolutionary committee. The propaganda team provided individual help to these people. They also, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teachings of "class struggle, once grasped, it works," went deep into the families to carry out class education. Li Dequan, the head of the "Red Rebel Corps" of the Fifth Pit, was not included in the three-in-one leadership team and developed a negative attitude, wanting to slack off. Deputy Director Zhou Rongchang of the propaganda team visited his home multiple times to conduct class education. When Li Dequan talked about the painful life of his family in the old society, he shed tears of sorrow and said excitedly: "Wanting to lie down and not do anything is the beginning of forgetting one's roots, betraying benefactor Chairman Mao, and betraying the comrades-in-arms, the PLA!"

After studying in the classes, these revolutionary cadres and leaders of mass organizations who were not integrated thoroughly criticized the "self" factor and thoroughly established the "public" factor. They were boundlessly loyal to Chairman Mao, established the correct attitude of doing whatever the Party asks them to do. No matter what work they did, they were diligent and hardworking, and did whatever they should say and manage. They also actively helped the revolutionary committee summarize experiences and lessons, improve work methods, and make the revolutionary committee better play the role of the command center for class struggle and production struggle. The revolutionary cadres and leaders of mass organizations who were not integrated in the Fifth Pit would, whenever the revolutionary committee made a resolution, study it seriously and implement it resolutely. They also promoted the workers to study and research, and seriously implement it. Once they heard that someone was spreading dissatisfaction with the revolutionary committee among the masses, they immediately reported it to the revolutionary committee and, together with the committee members, studied Chairman Mao's statements on class and class struggle, reminding the committee members that in the new struggle situation, they must strengthen their class struggle consciousness, raise their consciousness of line struggle, and guard against the class enemies sabotaging the newly born revolutionary committee. Chen Yongliang, the former deputy mine manager, found that the quality of the coal was not good enough while working in the coal selection plant. After investigation, it was mainly due to some workers having weak political responsibility. He then promoted the cadres and workers to study Chairman Mao's great teachings of "extreme responsibility for work," and repeatedly told them about the great significance of producing more and better coal for the state for achieving the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and supporting the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world.

    没有结合的革命干部和群众组织负责人应该怎样对待革委会？
    支持革委会用毛泽东思想掌好权用好权
    解放军某部驻平安煤矿毛泽东思想宣传队和矿革委会举办毛泽东思想学习班，开展谈心和家庭访问，帮助他们树立全心全意为人民服务的思想
    本报讯　革命委员会成立以后，怎样充分调动没有结合进去的革命领导干部和革命群众组织负责人的积极性？解放军某部驻辽宁阜新矿务局平安煤矿的毛泽东思想宣传队和矿革命委员会的作法是：为这两部分同志举办毛泽东思想学习班，并且开展谈心和家庭访问活动，启发他们以无限忠于毛主席的红心，积极支持革委会的工作，帮助革委会用毛泽东思想掌好权用好权。
    今年三月成立的平安煤矿革命委员会，由于名额限制等原因，只吸收了一部分革命领导干部和革命群众组织的负责人。有些革命领导干部和革命群众组织的负责人没有进入革委会。他们之中，多数同志能牢记毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的伟大教导，不考虑个人地位，积极主动地帮助革委会工作。但是，也有人因为“私”字作怪，认为：“自己造走资派的反比较早，成绩大，革委会个别成员不如我。”“自己站出来早，没有加入三结合，是群众不相信，上级对我有看法。”……因此，产生了不服气、怨气和泄气等思想，在革命和生产中产生了消极影响。宣传队发现这一问题以后，进行了反复的讨论研究。大家认为：这些没有结合进去的革命领导干部和革命群众组织负责人，一般都有一定的阶级斗争经验，经过一年多无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟都有提高，是一批抓革命促生产的骨干力量，必须充分调动他们的革命积极性。
    为了调动这部分同志的革命积极性，毛泽东思想宣传队和矿革委会为他们举办了毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里组织大家反复学习“老三篇”，学习毛主席的“共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”的伟大教导，以三个光辉形象为榜样，以“完全”“彻底”为标准，以两个“极端”为尺子，大破一个“私”字，大立一个“公”字。
    毛泽东思想宣传队针对有的革命群众组织负责人对革委会有的成员不服气的思想，在学习班里和大家一起学习毛主席要正确对待自己的伟大教导，学习林副主席“一定要先让自己跳出自己的范围，不要只看到自己”的指示，大力宣传伟大领袖毛主席领导无产阶级文化大革命取得的伟大胜利。大家认识到：我们所取得的一切成就，都应归功于伟大领袖毛主席，归功于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，决不是那一个革命领导干部和革命群众组织负责人的个人功劳。矿“联筹”的负责人黄显贵，在文化大革命中和大家一起造了党内走资派的反，作出了一定的贡献。这次没有选进革委会，有点想不通。经过学习，他深深地感到：革命的目的，不是为了个人当“官”，是为了防止资本主义复辟，国家不变颜色。有成绩不能骄傲，应当谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，发扬优点，克服缺点，革命到底，这样才能无限忠于毛主席，在新的斗争中为人民立新功。
    针对有的革命领导干部因为没有加入革命三结合领导班子而产生的怨气，毛泽东思想宣传队遵照毛主席“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好”的伟大教导，在学习班里开展了普遍的谈心活动，广泛深入地做思想政治工作。谈心时，首先和这些同志一起学习毛主席语录：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”帮助他们坚定不移地相信群众，相信党，帮助他们树立全心全意为人民服务的思想。原副矿长陈永良，是个在旧社会里苦大仇深的老工人，年纪大了，这次没有结合。当时，他看到原来的矿长和另一个副矿长加入革命三结合领导班子，心里有些怨气。去年来这个矿支左的宣传队里的李树森同志，就多次和他促膝谈心，和他一起忆苦思甜，提高了他的阶级觉悟。他在学习班里深挖了怨气的根子。说：“怨气不彻底打倒，就不能做到爱护和支持革委会，更不能做到无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。”其他人也从陈永良的亮私斗私中受到了教育。他们说：我们一定要以对毛主席的无限忠心，积极支持新生的革命委员会！
    毛泽东思想宣传队还分析了有的人因为没有加入革委会而产生的泄气情绪。宣传队对这些人进行了个别帮助，他们还遵照毛主席“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的伟大教导，深入到家庭去开展阶级教育。五井“红色造反团”的负责人李德全没有加入三结合的领导班子，产生了消极情绪，想往下滑。宣传队副指导员周荣昌便多次到他家进行阶级教育。当李德全谈到自己一家人在旧社会的痛苦生活时，伤心地流了眼泪，他激动地说：“我想躺下不干是忘本的开始，对不起恩人毛主席，对不起亲人解放军！”
    经过在学习班学习，这些没有结合进去的革命干部和革命群众组织负责人，大破了“私”字，大立了“公”字。他们无限忠于毛主席，确立了党叫干啥就干啥的正确态度。无论做什么工作，都能兢兢业业，埋头苦干，该说的就说，该管的就管，并主动帮助革委会总结经验教训，改进工作方法，使革委会更好地发挥阶级斗争和生产斗争指挥部的作用。五井没有结合进去的革命干部和革命群众组织负责人，每逢革委会制定了决议，他们都认真学习，坚决贯彻执行，同时推动职工们学习、研究，认真落实。有一次他们听说有人在群众中散布对革委会的不满情绪，就马上反映给革委会，并和革委会成员共同学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，提醒委员们在新的斗争形势下，一定要加强阶级斗争观念，提高路线斗争觉悟，严防阶级敌人破坏新生的革命委员会。原副矿长陈永良在选煤厂劳动时，发现煤的质量不够好，经过了解，主要是因为有的职工政治责任心不强引起的。于是，他就推动干部、工人学习毛主席“对工作的极端的负责任”的伟大教导，向他们反复讲为国家多出煤、出好煤，对夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利和支援世界人民革命斗争的重大意义。
