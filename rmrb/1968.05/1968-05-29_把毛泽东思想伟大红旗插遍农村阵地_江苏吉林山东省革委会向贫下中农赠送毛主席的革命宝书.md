The great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought will be planted throughout the rural battlefields. The revolutionary committees of Jiangsu, Jilin, and Shandong provinces are presenting Mao Zedong's revolutionary treasures to the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" They are determined to treat Chairman Mao's books as revolutionary heirlooms, learning them generation after generation, using Mao Zedong Thought to transform their souls, and following Chairman Mao to revolutionize for life.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, May 28th: After the Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Committee decided to present each household of poor and lower-middle peasants in the province with one copy each of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the "Three Articles," all levels of revolutionary committees have, with the most enthusiastic political spirit and the fastest speed, delivered the revolutionary treasures into the hands of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Currently, more than half of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the province have received the revolutionary treasures.

A ship sailing on the sea needs a helmsman, and a revolution needs Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Jiangsu are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. From long-term revolutionary practice, they have felt that reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions is victory. They compare Chairman Mao's works to sunlight, rain, and a steering wheel, as the lifeblood of the poor and lower-middle peasants. To meet the urgent needs of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, the Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Committee decided, upon its establishment, to present revolutionary treasures to all poor and lower-middle peasants in the province.

On the joyous day of presenting "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the "Three Articles" to the poor and lower-middle peasants, from the shores of the Yellow Sea to the banks of Lake Hongze, from the Xuhuai Plain to the water towns of Jiangnan, everywhere is a scene of joy. Wherever the car carrying the revolutionary treasures arrives, there are drums and gongs, and firecrackers. After receiving the long-awaited revolutionary treasures, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants shout enthusiastically time and again: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" The poor and lower-middle peasants said excitedly: We will definitely study and apply Chairman Mao's works better in the three great revolutionary movements and win continuous victories.

Currently, the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the rural areas of Jiangsu Province is unprecedentedly high. The province has held more than 47,000 sessions of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with more than 10 million people participating in the study.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, May 28th: The Jilin Provincial Revolutionary Committee decided to present "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Mao badges to all poor and lower-middle peasants in the province. Currently, relevant departments such as railways, transportation, and post offices in the province are, with the greatest political enthusiasm, delivering the revolutionary treasures and Mao badges to various rural areas in the province.

Recently, the Jilin Provincial Revolutionary Committee held a grand meeting in Dongsheng People's Commune, Dehui County, to present the revolutionary treasure "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Mao badges to the poor and lower-middle peasants. More than 15,000 poor and lower-middle peasants, with profound proletarian feelings of infinite love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, held high portraits of Chairman Mao, beat drums, and came to participate in the meeting. Vice Chairman Zheng Jiqu of the Jilin Provincial Revolutionary Committee, on behalf of the provincial revolutionary committee, presented the revolutionary treasure "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Mao badges to the poor and lower-middle peasants. Zhang Dama, a representative of the poor peasants in Dongsheng Brigade's Fifth Production Team who received the revolutionary treasures and Mao badges, said excitedly at the meeting, "We poor and lower-middle peasants love to read Chairman Mao's books, but in the past, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents did everything they could to sabotage us poor and lower-middle peasants from studying Chairman Mao's revolutionary treasures. Today, the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat have taken power, and we have obtained the revolutionary treasures. We must read Chairman Mao's books well, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end."

All levels of revolutionary committees in the province held solemn ceremonies to present books and badges to the poor and lower-middle peasants. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and wearing the golden Mao badges, shouted thousands of times: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" They stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and solemnly swore: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your book is the lifeblood of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We will read your book for life, listen to your words, and follow you to revolutionize for life.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, May 28th: The Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the leading organs of the People's Liberation Army Jinan Command, and the Shandong Military Region presented revolutionary treasures "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the "Three Articles" to every household of poor and lower-middle peasants in the province. After receiving the revolutionary treasures, the more than 80 million households of poor and lower-middle peasants in the province were all joyful and excited, shouting thousands of times: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants expressed that they would definitely treat Chairman Mao's books as revolutionary heirlooms, learning them generation after generation, turning Mao Zedong Thought into their souls, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever following Chairman Mao, and carrying out the Chinese revolution and the world revolution to the end.

This time, the leading organs of Shandong Province presented revolutionary treasures to all poor and lower-middle peasants in the province, greatly promoting the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought. The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the rural areas of the province has reached a new high, and Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, covering the vast rural areas. A retired old Red Army soldier from Linqing County, after receiving the revolutionary treasures, specially bought four red flowers and hung them on Chairman Mao's portrait, saying that the four red flowers represent the four red hearts of his family. He expressed that his whole family would forever be red-hearted and forever follow Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. On the same day, he held a family remembrance meeting to educate his family on class and class struggle.

After receiving the revolutionary treasures, many poor and lower-middle peasants, with their infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao, used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism. They angrily exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of the biggest capitalist roaders within the party and their agents in Shandong who madly opposed the party, opposed socialism, and opposed Mao Zedong Thought. They are determined to continue to grasp class struggle, root out traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries. They are determined to grasp the revolution and promote production, and strive to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.
