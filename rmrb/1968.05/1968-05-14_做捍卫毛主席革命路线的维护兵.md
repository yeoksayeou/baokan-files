Edition: 3

We, the three soldiers of the maintenance team, have been stationed on the frontline of the East China Sea for many years, carrying out the glorious task of maintaining the national defense lines. Although we are far from our leaders and live in a remote coastal village, we have a heart that is loyal to Chairman Mao. Following the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin, we read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Relying on the local poor and lower-middle peasants, we have achieved some success in maintaining the lines.

Since the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been vigorously carried out nationwide, the revolutionary storm has also swept through this remote village. In the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, how can we keep up with Chairman Mao, the broad revolutionary masses, and the rapidly developing new revolutionary situation? We face new challenges. In the past, we were able to overcome difficulties and achieve some success all thanks to Mao Zedong Thought. Today, to stand firm and unyielding in the face of great storms and waves, and to achieve new successes, we still need Mao Zedong Thought. We must follow Chairman Mao in revolution, tempering our unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, and become defenders of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The battle position designated by Chairman Mao must not be left for an inch.

Chairman Mao calls on us: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" How should we pay attention to state affairs? We have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, further understanding the great significance of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and recognizing our heavy responsibilities. The line we maintain is a national defense line. Every day and night, the voice of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao must be transmitted through this line to the border guards, islands, and the hearts of the broad cadres and revolutionary masses. Below, there are also many important situations that need to be reported to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao through this line. Our three people ensuring the smooth communication of this communication line is an actual action to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Over the past year, in order to maintain the line, we have fought against nature, against the land, against class enemies, and also against the "self" in our minds. Whenever we encounter problems, we always use Chairman Mao's teachings to reflect, think from the perspective of state affairs, and compare ourselves with revolutionary heroes, gradually establishing the idea that revolution comes first and work comes first.

In August and September of last year, a handful of capitalist roaders within the local party, unwilling to accept their doom, colluded with ghosts and demons in society, stirring up trouble and employing various tricks, adding many difficulties to our work for a period of time. Faced with such complex situations, what should we do? The more difficulties we face, the more we must stick close to Chairman Mao with our red hearts, and the more we must root ourselves among the poor and lower-middle peasants. We repeatedly studied the "Three Articles," Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and recognized the excellent situation of the nationwide Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, clarifying the direction of struggle. Everyone realized: Our position is the battle position designated by Chairman Mao, the position to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and we must not leave it for an inch.

At that time, the old soldier Shen Zhenwang's father fell ill, and he repeatedly wrote letters urging him to return home to see him. Shen Zhenwang said: "Personal matters, no matter how big, are small matters; state matters, no matter how small, are big matters. Now, defending Chairman Mao is the most important!"

The struggle made us love our battle positions even more. The lines we maintain, every wooden pole connects to Tiananmen, and every wire reaches Beijing. One day, while inspecting the lines, we found a segment of water line that had been exposed on the tidal flat due to long-term erosion by tidal water. If we did not bury it quickly, it might be damaged by the enemy. What should we do? We, following Chairman Mao's teachings of trusting and relying on the masses, mobilized nine militiamen and together buried the water line. One afternoon, the line was not working. Shen Zhenwang and Hu Xueyi rushed out to inspect the line. They carefully inspected it but found no faults, yet the line was still not working. It was already dark, and Mao Zedong's teachings of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people echoed in their ears. They turned back and inspected the hundreds of wooden poles one by one, continuing until the next morning. Later, a fault was found in another section, the line was restored, and they returned happily.

Being Defenders of Chairman Mao's Proletarian Revolutionary Line

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we not only steadfastly guarded our work positions but also directly participated in the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in the local area, defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao said: "To study Marxism, one must not only learn from books but mainly through class struggle, practical work, and getting close to the workers and peasants, can one truly learn it." Following this teaching of Chairman Mao, we three visited ten production teams and conducted home visits to the poor and lower-middle peasants. The intense struggle between the two roads in the countryside made us deeply shocked and received a vivid education on class struggle. Why, during the cooperative movement, did some people want to dissolve the cooperatives? Why, during the three years of natural disasters, did some people spread the black wind of "three freedoms and one contract"? Through investigation and discussion, we deeply understood that this was the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. The untransformed landlords and rich peasants are always dreaming of restoring their lost "paradise." Liu Shaoqi is the agent of the landlords, rich peasants, and the bourgeoisie. He fiercely opposes Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, pushing the bourgeois reactionary line in the countryside, attempting to restore capitalism. Through our visits, we also saw that the broad poor and lower-middle peasants have unlimited love for Chairman Mao; they resolutely follow Chairman Mao in taking the socialist road. The facts further educated us that whether or not to engage in the struggle between the two lines is a major issue concerning which road our country will take and whether the political power will change color. We are revolutionary soldiers. If we only see the two lines on the telephone poles and do not see the struggle between the two lines in politics, we will lose our direction and become confused soldiers. We are not only the maintenance guards of the telephone lines but also the defenders of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Together with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, we wielded the thousand-catty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi. We held large criticism meetings, set up large criticism columns, conducted field criticisms and sentry criticisms, inviting old poor peasants to recall village and family histories. The revolutionary criticism greatly aroused the broad revolutionary masses' hatred for Liu Shaoqi and deepened their unlimited love for the great leader Chairman Mao.

We learned that in some production teams in the local area, due to the influence of "three freedoms and one contract," some members had privately opened mountain land that had not been handed over to the collective. When we were about to deal with this issue with the poor and lower-middle peasants, someone advised us: "You shouldn't meddle in other people's business!" Is this "other people's business"? Seeing that the poison of Liu Shaoqi in the production teams had not been eliminated, how could a revolutionary soldier not care? This is not "other people's business"; this is the most important and greatest matter of insisting on the socialist road and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We resolutely, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, studied Chairman Mao's works, criticized Liu Shaoqi's fallacies of "three freedoms and one contract." Some members said: "If we don't hand over the land, we will fall into Liu Shaoqi's trap and take the wrong road, suffering twice!" Many members said: "We must discard the 'self' and establish the 'public,' following Chairman Mao on the bright socialist road." These several production teams not only quickly handed over the privately opened mountain land to the collective but also organized work on the tidal flats to expand the collective's land.

In February of this year, someone, under the pretext of "celebrating the Spring Festival lively," came to our village to perform dragon and phoenix dances, spreading feudal backward ideas, and many people gathered to watch. We tried to push our way in to stop them, but some people feared trouble and told us not to interfere. At this time, we thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and monsters must be criticized and must not be allowed to spread freely." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the cultural garbage of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism advocated by Liu Shaoqi is still poisoning the people. Can a Communist Party member not care? No! Our comrades, holding the Red Book, stood up and propagated Chairman Mao's literary thoughts. Soldiers from a nearby unit also joined us in propagating, persuading them to stop the performance. That evening, the commune sent a propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought. After the performance, the broad masses happily said: Today, we watched a play, broke the dragon, broke the phoenix, and also filled a big hole in our thoughts. In the past, we only knew how to watch plays and have fun, but today we know that there is also a struggle between the two lines in watching plays!

The instructions of Chairman Mao, we follow them to the letter.

Our maintenance team is a small unit for battle readiness and duty. The higher authorities have not assigned us the task of supporting the left. However, since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary masses often come to our door, asking us to help solve some problems. Should we handle it or not? Some comrades said: "We have battle readiness tasks, and the higher authorities have not ordered us to support the left." Some comrades said: "Doing mass work is the glorious tradition of our army. Revolutionary masses come to us, this is mass work that comes to our door." Just at this time, Chairman Mao's great call came: "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses." Everyone said: "We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions to the letter, without any discount." We decided to go to the masses to propagate Mao Zedong Thought.

Soon, the busy spring plowing season arrived. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants were full of enthusiasm, but many cadres had not come forward, and no one was in charge of production. At this critical moment, the radio broadcast the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and All Levels of Cadres in the Rural People's Communes Across the Country," calling on the broad revolutionary cadres to bravely come forward to "grasp revolution and promote production," and quickly launch a spring plowing production high tide. What a wise decision, what timely spring rain! We wrote down every word and every sentence, and stayed up all night to write big-character posters and blackboard newspapers. The next morning, we three ran through ten production teams, knocking on every door to propagate Chairman Mao's instructions, and studied and discussed with the heads of the revolutionary mass organizations.

From the discussion, we learned that the party branch secretary insisted on the socialist direction, worked actively, and was generally good, but had some problems with his work style. Because he was criticized by the masses, he had some resentment. Should we help him come forward? We thought: Such a big matter, can we three soldiers bear it? If we mess it up, it is a matter of principle. What should we do? We opened the Red Book, studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, and repeatedly studied the letter from the Party Central Committee, clarifying that the vast majority of cadres at all levels in the rural people's communes are good and relatively good. The black wind of "striking a large number and protecting a few" blown by Liu Shaoqi is precisely an attempt to resist Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and divert the direction of the struggle. The class enemies hope that revolutionary cadres will not come forward, so they can sabotage spring plowing production, sabotage the socialist economy, and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a serious class struggle. We thought: Helping one more revolutionary cadre to come forward is adding one more force to the revolution, and is a heavy blow to Liu Shaoqi.

We studied the "Three Articles" with this party branch secretary five times. While working, we talked to him, helping him understand Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, inspiring him to correctly face the masses' criticism, and also recalled bitterness and sweetness with his whole family. In this way, we finally untied the knot in his mind. He said: "The masses criticize me to criticize away my shortcomings and errors, to criticize away the things in me that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought. If I don't work hard, how can I face Chairman Mao!" He actively went to the masses to make a self-criticism and obtained the understanding of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. Under his influence, many cadres in the production team came forward one after another. They actively led the spring plowing production and won a great victory, achieving a bumper harvest of early rice.

Over the past year, we three soldiers, in the sharp and complex class struggle, were able to make some progress all thanks to the great Mao Zedong Thought, all thanks to our heart being loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, and closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. In the future, we will resolutely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further raise the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, constantly reform our worldview, and forever be red maintenance guards loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

    做捍卫毛主席革命路线的维护兵
    南京部队活学活用毛泽东思想先进集体、某部机务站歧头线路维护组
    我们维护组三个战士，长年执勤在东海前线，担负着维护国防线路的光荣任务。虽然远离领导，住在偏僻的海边农村，但是我们靠着一颗忠于毛主席的红心，遵照林副主席的指示，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，依靠驻地贫下中农，维护线路取得了一些成绩。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，在全国轰轰烈烈地开展以后，革命斗争的风暴也刮到了这个边远的农村。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，怎样才能跟上毛主席，跟上广大革命群众，跟上飞速发展的革命新形势？我们面临着新的考验。我们过去所以能够克服困难，做出一些成绩，全靠毛泽东思想；今天，要在大风大浪中看得清，站得稳，过得硬，取得新的成绩，还要靠毛泽东思想。我们要紧跟毛主席干革命，要千锤百炼对毛主席的无限忠心，做一个捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的维护兵。
    毛主席指定的战斗岗位，寸步不能离
    毛主席号召我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”应该怎样关心国家大事呢？我们反复学习了毛主席的一系列最新指示，进一步认识到这场无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，认识到自己担负的重大责任。我们维护的这条线路是国防线路。每日每夜，以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的声音，要通过这条线路，传到边防、海岛，传到广大指战员和革命群众的心坎里。下面也有许多重要的情况，要通过这条线路，向以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部请示报告。我们三个人保证这条通信线路的畅通，就是以实际行动保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    一年来，我们为了维护线路，与天斗，与地斗，与阶级敌人斗，也与自己头脑里的“私”字斗。碰到问题，总是用毛主席的教导照一照，从国家大事上想一想，和革命的英雄人物比一比，逐步树立起革命第一、工作第一的思想。
    去年八、九月份，本地区党内一小撮走资派不甘心他们的灭亡，勾结社会上的牛鬼蛇神，兴风作浪，施展种种阴谋诡计，一段时间内给我们的工作增加了许多困难。面临这种复杂的情况，怎么办？越困难，我们越要把红心贴紧毛主席，越要把根子扎在贫下中农当中。我们反复学习“老三篇”，学习毛主席的最新指示，认清全国无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，明确斗争方向。大家认识到：我们的岗位是毛主席指定的战斗岗位，是捍卫毛主席革命路线的岗位，我们寸步不能离开。
    当时，老战士沈振旺的父亲生病，几次来信催他回家看看。沈振旺说：“个人的事再大也是小事，国家的事再小也是大事。现在是保卫毛主席最重要！”
    斗争使我们更加热爱自己的战斗岗位。我们维护的这条线路，根根木杆连到天安门，条条电线通向北京城。有一天，我们在查线的时候发现有一段水线，由于长年受潮水冲刷，已经露出在海涂上。如果不赶紧埋设好，可能被敌人破坏。怎么办？我们三个人遵照毛主席相信群众、依靠群众的教导，发动了九个民兵，一起把水线埋好了。有一天下午，线路不通了，沈振旺和胡学娒抢着出去查线，他们认真地查了一遍，没查到什么故障，可是线路仍然不通。天已经黑了，在他们耳边响起毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导，他们又回过头来，对几百根木杆又逐根地检查了一遍，一直查到第二天清早。后来，别的地段查出了故障，线路通了，他们才高高兴兴地回来。
    做毛主席无产阶级革命路线的捍卫者
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们不仅始终坚守了工作岗位，而且还直接参加了驻地两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    毛主席说：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”遵照毛主席这个教导，我们三个人走遍了十个生产队，到贫下中农家进行访问。农村中两条道路激烈斗争的大量事实，使我们触目惊心，受到活生生的阶级斗争的教育。为什么在合作化运动中，有人却要解散合作社？为什么三年自然灾害时期，又有人刮起了“三自一包”的黑风？经过调查、讨论，我们深刻认识到，这就是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。没有改造好的地主、富农，每时每刻都在幻想恢复他们失去的“天堂”。中国赫鲁晓夫就是地主、富农和资产阶级的代理人。他疯狂反对毛主席的革命路线，在农村推行资产阶级反动路线，搞资本主义复辟。通过访问，我们也看到了广大贫下中农无限热爱毛主席，他们坚决跟毛主席走社会主义道路。事实进一步教育了我们，搞不搞两条路线斗争，是关系到我们国家走什么道路，政权变不变颜色的大问题。我们是革命战士，如果只看到电线杆上的两条线路，看不到政治上的两条路线的斗争，就会迷失方向，就是糊涂兵。我们既是电话线路的维护兵，更是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的捍卫者。
    我们和广大贫下中农一起，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫。开大批判会，办大批判专栏，搞田头批判、哨所批判，请老贫农忆村史、家史。革命的大批判大大激发了广大革命群众对中国赫鲁晓夫的仇恨，加深了对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。
    我们了解到当地有的生产队，由于受了“三自一包”的影响，有的社员私自开的山地，一直没有交给集体。当我们准备和贫下中农一起处理这个问题的时候，有人劝我们：“你们不要多管闲事！”这是“闲事”吗？眼看中国赫鲁晓夫在生产队里的流毒没有肃清，一个革命战士能不管吗？这不是“闲事”，这是坚持社会主义道路、坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线最大最重要的事。我们坚决和贫下中农一起学习毛主席著作，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”谬论。有的社员说：“我们不交地，就要上中国赫鲁晓夫的当，走回头路，吃二遍苦！”许多社员说：“我们要丢掉‘私’字，树立‘公’字，跟毛主席走社会主义的光明大道。”这几个生产队，不仅社员私开的山地很快地交给了集体，还组织到海涂上围塘，扩大了集体的土地。
    今年二月，有人借口“热热闹闹过春节”，到我们驻村玩龙耍凤，宣传封建落后思想，许多人围着看热闹。我们想挤进去劝阻，有的群众怕惹出是非，叫我们不要管。这时，我们想起毛主席的教导：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”无产阶级文化大革命发展到今天，中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的那一套封、资、修文艺黑货还在毒害人民，一个共产党员能够不管吗？不能！我们的同志拿着红色宝书，挺身而出，宣传毛主席的文艺思想，附近驻军某连的同志也和我们一起宣传，说服他们停止了演出。当天晚上，公社派来了一个毛泽东思想宣传队。演出后，广大群众高兴地说：今天看戏，破了龙，破了凤，还补了思想上的大漏洞。过去只晓得看戏开开心，今天才知道看戏也有两条路线斗争！
      毛主席的指示我们句句照办
    我们维护组是个战备执勤小单位，上级没有交给我们支左任务。可是，无产阶级文化大革命以来，革命群众经常找上门来，要求我们帮助解决一些问题。我们是管还是不管？有的同志说：“我们有战备任务，上级没有命令叫支左。”有的同志就说：“做群众工作是我军的光荣传统，革命群众来找我们，这是送上门来的群众工作。”正在这时，传来了毛主席的伟大号召：“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众。”大家说：
  “毛主席的指示我们要句句照办，不打折扣”。我们决心到群众中去宣传毛泽东思想。
    不久，春耕大忙时节到了，广大贫下中农劲头很足，可是很多干部还没有站出来，没有人抓生产。在这个节骨眼上，广播里传来了《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，号召广大革命干部勇敢地站出来“抓革命，促生产”，迅速掀起一个春耕生产高潮。这是多么英明的决定，多么及时的春雨！我们一字一句地记了下来，连夜抄写大字报、黑板报。第二天一早，我们三个人跑遍了十个生产队，挨家挨户去宣传毛主席的指示，又和革命群众组织的头头一起学习、讨论。
    从讨论中，我们了解到党支部书记坚持社会主义方向，工作积极，大节是好的，只是工作作风有些问题。他因为受到群众批判，有些抵触情绪。要不要帮助他站出来？我们想：这么大的事，我们三个战士担当得了吗？万一弄不好，可是个原则问题。怎么办？我们打开红色宝书，学习毛主席的有关教导，并且反复学习党中央的信，明确了农村人民公社各级干部绝大多数是好的和比较好的。中国赫鲁晓夫刮起的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的阴风，正是企图对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，转移斗争大方向。阶级敌人最希望革命干部站不出来，他们好破坏春耕生产，破坏社会主义经济，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。这是一场严重的阶级斗争。我们想：多帮助一个革命干部站出来，就是给革命增加一分力量，就是对中国赫鲁晓夫的一个沉重打击。
    我们先后五次和这位党支部书记一起学习“老三篇”，劳动的时候，和他边干边谈心，帮助他领会毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，启发他正确对待群众的批评，还和他全家一起忆苦思甜。这样，终于解开了他的思想疙瘩。他说：“群众批判我，是要批掉我的缺点错误，批掉我身上不符合毛泽东思想的东西，我不好好干，怎么对得起毛主席呢！”他主动地到群众中去作检查，得到了广大贫下中农的谅解。在他的带动和影响下，生产队的许多干部先后站出来了。他们积极领导春耕生产，打了个大胜仗，早稻获得了大丰收。
    一年多来，我们三个战士在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，所以能够取得一些进步，全靠伟大的毛泽东思想，全靠我们对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。今后，我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，不断改造自己的世界观，永远做一个忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的红色维护兵。
