The great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin personally approved, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group issued an order to posthumously award Comrade Men He with the honorable title of "a good cadre who is unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." The news of this honor brought waves of excitement to my heart, and I could not calm down for a long time. This is Chairman Mao, in the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally setting a shining example of a good cadre of the Party for us, the greatest concern, encouragement, education, and inspiration for the people and soldiers of the entire nation. Let us shout "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times, ten thousand times!" Let us sincerely wish Chairman Mao a long, long life! A long, long life!

Studying Comrade Men He's heroic deeds, thinking of Comrade Men He's shining image, and reciting Comrade Men He's words that shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, my heart is filled with great excitement. I am a Communist Party member, a revolutionary soldier. Like Comrade Men He, everything I have is given to me by Chairman Mao. After I was injured, Chairman Mao and the people of our motherland gave me a second life. I will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words; I will definitely follow Chairman Mao. Although I have only one hand, I will fight with one hand to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; although I have only one leg, I will forever march forward on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line with one leg.

After Chairman Mao issued the great call for "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left," my comrades quickly rushed to the front lines of "supporting the left." The leadership and comrades saw that my injuries were severe and I was also sick, so they let me rest and recuperate at home. But I couldn't sit still. I thought, with Chairman Mao's order, my comrades are all charging forward to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, how could I not go to the front lines? I immediately applied to the leadership to go to the front lines of "supporting the left" with my comrades. The leadership saw my resolute attitude and let me work at the "supporting the left" reception station. At the reception station, I enthusiastically received visiting revolutionary masses and did my part to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

When the drums of revolutionary criticism sounded, I, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, joined the battle. In the office, in the hospital, I overcame the difficulty of writing with a disabled hand and wrote dozens of articles criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev. Although I endured some hardships and pains, thinking that this was for defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, my heart was filled with joy. After being injured, several years of life and struggle practice made me deeply realize that being unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao and fighting at all times to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the greatest happiness. It is not terrible if a person's body is disabled, but it is terrible if one's soul is stained by the "private" character. A life shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, even if it is short, is the most glorious.

Since joining the revolution, under the nurturing of the great Mao Zedong Thought, although I have been advancing on the road of thought revolutionization, I am still far behind Comrade Men He. Comrade Men He's every moment of his life shone with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, and every step he took was firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Comrade Men He will forever be our example to learn from. In the future, I will definitely, like Comrade Men He, "always think of Chairman Mao, always follow Chairman Mao, always keep up with Chairman Mao, and always for Chairman Mao." I will always stand guard, keep watch, charge forward, and fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The sea may dry up, the rocks may crumble, but my red heart loyal to Chairman Mao will never change!

### 无限忠于毛主席  完全彻底为革命

    无限忠于毛主席  完全彻底为革命
    空军学习毛主席著作积极分子、“爱兵模范”  王裕昌
    伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲自批准，中共中央、中央军委、中央文革发布命令，追授门合同志以“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”的光荣称号。喜讯传来，我心潮澎湃，久久不能平静。这是毛主席在无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的大好形势下，为我们亲手树立的一个党的好干部的光辉榜样，是毛主席对全国军民的最大关怀、最大鼓舞、最大教育、最大激励，让我们千遍万遍地高呼毛主席万岁！万万岁！让我们最衷心地祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    学习门合同志的英雄事迹，想着门合同志的光辉形象，默诵着门合同志那字字句句闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的铿锵语言，我的心情万分激动。我是个共产党员，是个革命战士。和门合同志一样，我的一切都是毛主席给的。在我负伤以后，毛主席和祖国人民，又给了我第二次生命。听毛主席的话，我是听定了；跟毛主席走，我是跟定了。我虽然只有一只手，一只手也要为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而战；我虽然只有一条腿，一条腿也要永远沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线奋勇前进。
    毛主席发出“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召后，同志们都迅速奔赴“支左”第一线，领导上和同志们看我伤残严重，又患着病，就让我在家好好疗养休息。可我怎么也坐不住。我想，毛主席一声令下，同志们都为捍卫毛主席革命路线冲锋陷阵去了，我怎么能不上前线呢？我立即向上级申请，要和同志们一起到“支左”第一线去。领导看我态度坚决，就让我在“支左”接待站里工作。在接待站里，我热情地接待来访的革命群众，为宣传毛泽东思想、宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线尽了自己的一份力量。
    当革命大批判的战鼓擂响之后，我怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，带着对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，投入战斗。在办公室，在医院里，我克服了残手拿笔千斤重的困难，先后写了几十篇批判中国赫鲁晓夫的文章。我这样，虽然吃些苦，熬些痛，但想到这是为保卫毛主席革命路线而战，心里就乐滋滋的。伤残后，几年的生活和斗争实践，使我深深体会到，无限忠于毛主席，时时刻刻为捍卫毛主席革命路线而战，就是最大的幸福。一个人身体残废了并不可怕，可怕的是灵魂被“私”字沾污。闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的生命，再短促也无上光荣。
    从参加革命以来，我在伟大的毛泽东思想的哺育下，虽然在思想革命化的道路上不断前进，但比起门合同志还差得很远。门合同志一生的时时刻刻都放射着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉，他迈出的每一步都紧紧地站在毛主席的革命路线一边。
    门合同志永远是我们学习的榜样。今后我一定象门合同志那样，“一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席。”时刻为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，冲好锋，打好仗。海可枯，石可烂，忠于毛主席的红心永不变！
