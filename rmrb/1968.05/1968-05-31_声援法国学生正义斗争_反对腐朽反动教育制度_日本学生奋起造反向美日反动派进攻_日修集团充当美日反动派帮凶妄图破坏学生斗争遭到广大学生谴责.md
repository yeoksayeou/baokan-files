Japanese students have raised the banner of revolution and bravely launched a struggle against American imperialism, the Japanese reactionary government, and the current rotten educational system.

According to a report from the East China News Agency, students from many universities in Japan have been holding classes in protest against the school authorities' unreasonable expulsion of students, opposing the reactionary educational system, and opposing the school authorities' suppression of the student movement. They demand freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association within the university. Brave university students have set up barricades at the entrance of the school building and occupied classrooms. A leader of the Komazawa University student movement, Kiyomizu Nobuyuki, said: "Japanese students are full of enthusiasm to support the struggle of French students, supporting French students in their struggle against the reactionary educational system. We will fight to smash the entire reactionary educational system. We are determined to unite with students across the country to firmly fight against the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty.'"

Students from Tokyo Medical and Dental University have been on strike for four months to oppose the reactionary "practical training system" of the Sato reactionary government. The Sato reactionary government attempts to control young graduates of medical and dental universities through the establishment of the "practical training system," forcing them to serve as its vanguard in its militaristic infiltration of Southeast Asia and to serve American imperialism.

Students from Tokyo Medical and Dental University have been on strike, boycotting graduation and national exams. They have posted slogans everywhere in the campus and the walls of the university hospital, exposing the anti-people medical policies of the American-Japanese reactionaries and protesting the persecution of students leading the struggle by the reactionary university authorities.

On May 27, students held a rally in the campus of Tokyo Medical and Dental University and then occupied the office of the student affairs director. They also raised several red flags on the roof of the middle section of the university building.

Students from Waseda University have been holding meetings and demonstrations almost every day for nearly a month to oppose the school authorities' attempt to elect the university president in an undemocratic manner. On the scheduled election day of May 18, students set up picket lines in front of the election hall, occupied the election hall, and prevented the election from taking place.

The organ of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) Waseda University branch, the journal *Red River*, pointed out in an article that the struggle of Waseda University students and the struggle of French students have merged into one. *Red River* wrote: "The current struggle in Western Europe and North American countries is characterized by students and workers supporting each other and fighting side by side, thus fully unleashing their great revolutionary power."

*Red River* said that the great teacher Chairman Mao told us in his article "The Direction of the Youth Movement": "'Since the May Fourth Movement, what role have Chinese youth played? ... They have been an important part of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal front.' The brave struggles of French and other Western European and North American students have proven that Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment is completely correct."

Japanese university students have also been fighting. On the afternoon of the 28th, more than 5,000 students, despite the threats of police sent by the Sato reactionary government, marched proudly in the campus, severely condemning the university authorities for depriving students of their freedom of assembly, association, and speech, and for implementing barbaric fascist rule.

In their just struggle, Japanese students have further exposed the ugly face of the Japan Communist Party's revisionist clique as the henchmen of the American-Japanese reactionaries. The "Democratic Youth League" organization controlled by the Japan Communist Party's revisionist clique at Komazawa University was frightened by the surging student struggle and attempted to split the student struggle. Their evil deeds were severely condemned by the broad student body. A student leader from Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Niimura Akira, pointed out: Just as the ugly face of the French revisionists was exposed in the brave struggle of French workers and students, the Japanese Communist Party's revisionists have also fully exposed themselves as close collaborators of the American-Japanese reactionaries in the struggle of Japanese students.

    声援法国学生正义斗争  反对腐朽反动教育制度
    日本学生奋起造反向美日反动派进攻
    日修集团充当美日反动派帮凶妄图破坏学生斗争遭到广大学生谴责
    据新华社三十日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本许多大学的学生高举革命旗帜，奋起展开英勇斗争，反对美帝国主义、日本反动政府和现行的腐朽的教育制度。
    东京驹泽大学的学生从五月八日以来一直举行罢课，抗议学校当局无理开除学生，反对反动的教育制度，反对学校当局镇压学生运动，要求在大学里有言论、出版、集会、结社的自由。英勇的大学生在校楼的入口处筑起路障，占领了教室。驹泽大学学生运动的一位领导人清水信之说：“日本学生满怀着声援法国学生斗争的激情，支持法国学生反对反动的教育制度的斗争。我们要为粉碎整个反动的教育制度而斗争。我们决心同全国的学生团结一致，为粉碎日美‘安全条约’而坚决斗争。”
    东京医科齿科大学学生为反对佐藤反动政府反动的“实习制度”，坚持罢课已有四个月。佐藤反动政府企图通过建立“实习制度”来控制年青的医科齿科大学毕业生，迫使他们去充当它对东南亚地区进行军国主义渗透的先遣人员，并为美帝国主义服务。
    东京医科齿科大学学生举行罢课，抵制毕业和国家考试。他们在校园内，在大学医院的墙上，到处张贴标语，揭露美日反动派的反人民的医疗政策，抗议大学反动当局对领导斗争的学生进行迫害。
    五月二十七日，学生在东京医科齿科大学的校园内举行大会，然后占领了学生事务科科长的房间。他们还在大学大楼的中部屋顶上，升起了几面红旗。
    早稻田大学学生近一个月来几乎每天举行集会和示威，反对学校当局企图以不民主的方式选举这所学校的校长。在预定举行选举的五月十八日，学生们在选举大厅前面布置了纠察线，占领选举大厅，阻止进行选举。
    日中友好协会（正统）早稻田大学分会的学生的机关刊物《红河》在一篇文章中指出，早稻田大学学生的斗争和法国学生的斗争汇合成一体了。《红河》写道：“西欧、北美国家当前斗争的特点是，学生和工人相互支持，并肩战斗，从而充分发挥了他们巨大的革命力量。”
    《红河》说，伟大导师毛主席在他的《青年运动的方向》一文中告诉我们：“‘五四’以来，中国青年们起了什么作用呢？……是反帝反封建的一个方面军，而且是一个重要的方面军。”法国和其他西欧国家以及北美学生的英勇斗争证明，毛主席的这一英明论断完全正确。
    日本大学的学生也一直在进行斗争。二十八日下午，五千多名学生不顾佐藤反动政府派来的警察的威胁，斗志昂扬地在校园内举行示威。他们严厉谴责大学当局剥夺学生的集会、结社和言论的自由，实行野蛮的法西斯统治。
    日本学生在他们的正义斗争中，进一步认清了日共修正主义集团充当美日反动派帮凶的丑恶面目。驹泽大学由日共修正主义集团控制的“民主青年同盟”组织，被汹涌澎湃的学生斗争吓破了胆，企图分裂学生的斗争。他们的罪恶行径，受到广大学生的严厉谴责。东京医科齿科大学的一位学生领导人新山明指出：正如法国修正主义分子的丑恶面目在法国工人和学生的英勇斗争过程中暴露无遗一样，日共修正主义分子在日本学生的斗争中也充分暴露他们是美日反动派的亲密合作者。
