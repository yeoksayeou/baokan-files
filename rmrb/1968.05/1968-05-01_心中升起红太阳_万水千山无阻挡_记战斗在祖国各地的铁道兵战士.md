In the vast forests, on the boundless deserts, in the icy and snowy "high-cold forbidden zones," on the scorching "flame mountains," and across the country, the heroic iron road soldiers, following the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, march forward with a fighting posture, crossing mountains and rivers, laboring bravely, and building steel roads. Under the red sun's illumination, the socialist trains speed forward!

"With the red sun rising in our hearts, nothing can block our way." Wherever the iron road soldiers fight, there are countless songs praising the great leader Chairman Mao. On the grasslands, where there are no walls, they use stones to inlay Chairman Mao's quotations on the grass; in the rugged mountains, they arrange beautiful rocks into sunflower patterns facing the sun, symbolizing their hearts forever towards the red sun; in the primitive forests, the ancient pines reaching into the sky are giant billboards. The soldiers carve "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" and "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!" in giant letters, illuminating the vast green sea of forests.

"With Chairman Mao's wave, we advance." Wherever Chairman Mao points, the iron road soldiers, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, fight there and extend the steel roads there.

In the northernmost part of our country, there is a vast forest. Because of the extremely cold climate, it is known as the "high-cold forbidden zone." To build socialism, the iron road soldiers accepted the glorious mission given by the Party and Chairman Mao. Holding high the portrait of Chairman Mao, they built the railway into the snow-covered forests. The soldiers of the 9th Company of a unit known as the "Red Flag of the Forest" hung Chairman Mao's portrait high in the snowfields, singing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, shoveling snow and ice, and fighting fiercely on the bridge construction site. In less than seven months, they built two large bridges, creating a miracle of conquering the "high-cold forbidden zone."

On a railway line that crosses high mountains and rapid rivers, the iron road soldiers faced dangerous faults, fierce mudslides, and high concentrations of gas. They resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," overcoming countless difficulties and creating a national record of excavating one kilometer of tunnels in a month.

In a certain place in southern China, when the railway line was destroyed by heavy rain and floods, the iron road soldiers rushed to the construction site day and night, enduring torrential rain and knee-deep mud. Shouting "Determine to fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," they engaged in emergency repairs. They said that repairing the railway line is to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. After 39 hours of continuous struggle, they completed the task ahead of schedule with the revolutionary railway workers.

In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the iron road soldiers fighting across the country, far from Beijing, followed Chairman Mao closely. They held a single "loyalty" in their hearts for Chairman Mao, striving to learn and apply Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions, and bravely advanced following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment!

The great leader Chairman Mao issued the great battle call of "grasp revolution, promote production." The soldiers and officers of the 13th Company of a certain unit, following Chairman Mao's teachings, broke through the bourgeois technical "authorities'" fallacies and the old regulations in railway construction during the construction of a 90-meter-high bridge. They established the great aspirations of the proletariat, daring to take paths that others have not taken and daring to climb peaks that others have not climbed. They overcame one technical difficulty after another. The welding technology of steel beams is very demanding, and this company was operating in the air for the first time at such a height, facing many difficulties. However, the soldiers and officers hung Chairman Mao's portraits and quotations on the steel towers, bravely climbing the technical peaks. Under the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought, they successfully built this bridge with the latest technology.

When Chairman Mao's great call to "be thrifty and make revolution" reached the forest area, the worker-engineer Xu Jinrong, who came from a worker's background, accepted the technical guidance task of building a road bridge. Someone suggested that the forest area has plenty of wood, and more wood could be used for the bridge beams. Xu Jinrong resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call, cherishing wood like gold in the forest area, and actively suggested using a thrifty method of construction. He personally directed the scene and, after more than ten days of effort with the soldiers and officers, finally built the bridge, saving a large amount of wood and time.

Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people" became the voluntary action of the iron road soldiers. Wherever they went, they spread the invincible Mao Zedong Thought there. While building roads, they always thought of the people. In a certain border construction area, it was dry and rainless, and the villagers called that place the "old dry dam." The soldiers of the 6th Mechanical Company of a certain unit knew about this situation and expressed their determination to not only build a happy road for the people but also to bring Chairman Mao's care for the people of all ethnic groups to the people. They took advantage of the gaps in railway construction to build a reservoir with a capacity of 360,000 cubic meters for the people of all ethnic groups in less than a month. The "old dry dam" became a vast reservoir with rippling waves. The people of all ethnic groups could not help but shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the iron road troops thoroughly criticized the capitalist military line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, and more resolutely and consciously took the road of emphasizing proletarian politics. They turned the construction sites into classrooms for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and battlefields for criticizing and repudiating revisionism. They "built the railway with every shovel and pickaxe, fighting selfishness at every moment. Clearing the way for revolution, tempering red hearts through countless trials."

During the construction of a large bridge, the 13th Company of a certain unit discovered a small spot on the foundation of the bridge pier. The entire company held a self-criticism meeting at the bridgehead, using the microscope of Mao Zedong Thought to examine the cause of the spot. They said that the spot on the bridge pier was the manifestation of the "self" in our minds. Although the spot could be covered with two shovelfuls of soil, the "self" could not be covered. If the "self" is not removed, today the spot is covered, but tomorrow a "rat hole" will appear. Thus, the entire company fiercely criticized the "self," dealt with the spot, and everyone attended a vivid class on criticizing and repudiating revisionism.

On the iron road troops' motor transport line, there was a driver model named Cheng Zihua. He drove his truck year after year on high mountains and steep cliffs, transporting materials for railway construction. He turned the process of driving into a process of eliminating selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, checking the car once and checking selfishness once; removing a fault once and fiercely criticizing selfishness once. For more than ten years, he always maintained that the truck did not have any faults on the road, completing the transport tasks month after month and year after year, creating a new record in the army of safe driving for nearly 300,000 kilometers without intermediate repairs.

The young female technician Zhao Jinling used the "Three Articles" as a sharp weapon to eliminate selfish thoughts and used the fiery struggle as a battlefield for eliminating selfishness and establishing public-mindedness. In harsh environments, she fiercely criticized the fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev's "closed-door cultivation"; in dangerous places, she fiercely criticized the "philosophy of survival." When a mountain flood washed away the bridge, she, like the male comrades, braved the heavy rain and jumped into the water up to her waist to repair the bridge; when the tunnel construction encountered a cave-in, she braved the danger and entered the cave to remove the obstacles.

The broad ranks of soldiers and officers held a single "loyalty" in their hearts for the great leader Chairman Mao, emphasizing a single "use" for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, in socialist construction, and on the land of the motherland, they laid down steel transport lines and built a "public" road to communism in their minds, striving forward to win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　心中升起红太阳　万水千山无阻挡
　　——记战斗在祖国各地的铁道兵战士
    在莽莽林海，在浩瀚的戈壁滩，在冰封雪飘的“高寒禁区”，在灼热的“火焰山”上，在祖国的四面八方，英雄的铁道兵战士紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以战斗的姿态，穿山涉水，英勇劳动，修建起一条条钢铁大道，让社会主义的列车在红太阳照耀下飞驰前进！　　
　　一
    “心中升起红太阳，万水千山无阻挡。”各地的铁道兵战士们，战斗在那里，那里就响起赞颂伟大领袖毛主席的千歌万曲。草原上没有墙，他们用石子把一条条毛主席语录镶在草地上；在崇山峻岭中，他们把瑰丽的岩石，排成葵花向阳的图案，表示颗颗红心永向红太阳；在原始森林里，耸入云天的古松，是巨大的标语塔，战士们雕刻的“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆”的巨幅标语，映红了碧波万顷的林海。
    “毛主席挥手我前进。”毛主席指到那里，无限忠于毛主席的铁道兵战士们，就打到那里，就把钢铁大道伸展到那里。
    在我国最北方，有一片巨大的林海。因为气候奇冷，被称为“高寒禁区”。为了建设社会主义，铁道兵战士接受了党和毛主席交给的光荣任务，高擎毛主席画像，把铁路修进林海雪原。被誉为“林海红旗”的某部的九连战士们，把毛主席像高挂在雪原上，高唱毛主席语录歌，铲雪刨冰，大战在桥梁工地上，不到七个月，就修起两座大桥，创造了征服“高寒禁区”的奇迹。
    在一条穿高山、跨激流的铁路干线上，铁道兵战士面对险恶的断层，凶猛的泥石流，高强度的瓦斯，坚决贯彻毛主席提出的“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大方针，排除千难万险，创造了隧道一个月开挖一千米的全国新纪录。
    在祖国的南方某地，当铁路干线被暴雨洪水冲毁的时候，铁道兵战士星夜兼程奔赴工地，头顶瓢泼大雨，脚踩过膝淤泥，高喊着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，投入了抢修。他们说，抢修铁路干线，就是保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。经过三十九小时的连续奋战，终于和铁路革命职工一起，提前完成了任务。
　　二
    在无产阶级文化大革命取得节节胜利的凯歌声中，战斗在祖国山南海北的铁道兵战士，远隔北京万水千山，紧跟毛主席寸步不离。他们对毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，努力学好用好毛主席发出的一系列极为重要的最新指示，紧紧跟着毛主席的伟大战略部署奋勇前进！
    伟大领袖毛主席发出了“抓革命，促生产”的伟大战斗号令。某部十三连指战员遵照毛主席的教导，在修建一座高达九十米的大桥时，大破资产阶级技术“权威”的谬论，大破铁路施工中旧的规章制度，树立无产阶级的雄心壮志，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰，攻克一个又一个技术难关。钢梁焊接技术要求很高，这个连队第一次在这样高的空中作业，困难很多。但是指战员们在钢塔架上挂满了毛主席像和毛主席语录，勇敢地攀登技术高峰。在毛泽东思想阳光照耀下，他们胜利地建成了这座最新技术水平的大桥。
    当毛主席的“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召到达林区的时候，工人出身的工程师徐锦荣接受了架设一座公路桥的技术指导任务。有人提出林区木材多，可以多用木材架梁。徐锦荣坚决响应毛主席的号召，身在林区，爱木如金，积极建议采用节约木材的土办法施工。他亲临现场指挥，和指战员们经过十多天的努力，终于把桥架了起来，既争取了时间，又节省了大量木材。
    毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，成了铁道兵战士自觉的行动。他们走到那里，就把战无不胜的毛泽东思想传播到那里。他们在修路时，还处处为群众着想。施工的边疆某地，干旱少雨，社员们称那一带为“老旱坝”。某部机械六连的战士们知道了这种情况，纷纷表示，不仅要给人民修出一条幸福路，还要把伟大领袖毛主席对各族人民的关怀带给群众。他们利用铁路施工的间隙，在不到一个月的时间里为各族人民修起一座容水量三十六万立方米的水库。“老旱坝”变成了碧波荡漾的大水库。各族人民情不自禁地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
　　三
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，铁道兵广大指战员彻底批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿所推行的资产阶级军事路线，更坚决更自觉地走突出无产阶级政治的道路。他们把工地变成活学活用毛主席著作的课堂，斗私批修的战场。他们“一镐一锹修铁路，每时每刻斗私心。披荆斩棘干革命，千锤百炼铸红心。”
    某部十三连在大桥施工中，发现桥墩基础部分出现了一小块麻点，全连同志就在桥头召开斗私会，用毛泽东思想的显微镜照照出现麻点的原因。他们说，桥墩上的麻点是我们头脑中“私”字的表现。麻点虽然可以用两锹土盖住，但“私”字是盖不住的。“私”字不刨掉，今天盖住了麻点，明天又会出“狗洞”。于是全连同志狠斗“私”字，处理了麻点，人人上了一堂生动的斗私批修课。
    在铁道兵汽车运输线上，有个叫程芝荷的司机标兵，他驾驶的汽车，长年奔驰在高山峻岭之间，为铁路建设运送材料。他把开车的过程变成破私立公的过程，检查一次车子，检查一次私心；排除一次故障，狠斗一次私心。十几年如一日，始终保持汽车不带故障上路，年年月月圆满完成运输任务，创造了安全行驶近三十万公里无中修的全军新纪录。
    青年女技术员赵金岭，把“老三篇”当作扫除私心杂念的锐利武器，把火热的斗争当作破私立公的战场。在艰苦环境中狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“闭门修养”的谬论，在危险的地方狠斗“活命哲学”。山洪把桥冲断了，她跟男同志一样，冒着大雨，跳进齐腰深的水中奋勇抢修；隧道施工中遇到塌方，她冒着危险进洞排除障碍。
    广大指战员对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想突出一个“用”字，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，在社会主义建设中，在祖国大地上铺出了一条条钢铁运输线，在头脑中筑起一条通向共产主义的“公”字大道，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利而奋勇前进！
