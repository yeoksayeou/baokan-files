The French working masses have recently launched a magnificent wave of strike struggles, demonstrating the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat.

The French working class has a long and glorious revolutionary tradition.

In March 1871, the workers of Paris raised the red flag of proletarian revolution, launching a heroic armed uprising. They made the "first attempt at proletarian revolution to smash the bourgeois state machine" and established the first proletarian dictatorship in human history—the Paris Commune.

To defend the Paris Commune, the workers of Paris, facing the frenzied bourgeois Versaille gang, fought fearlessly, one after another, in a bloody struggle. Countless martyrs sacrificed their lives shouting the slogan "Long live the Commune!"

The great teacher of the international proletariat, Marx, once enthusiastically praised the workers of Paris, saying: "What flexibility, what historical initiative, what spirit of self-sacrifice these Parisians have! ... There has never been such an example of heroic struggle in history!" The heroes of the Paris Commune created an everlasting historical merit for the proletariat of the whole world and set a brilliant revolutionary example.

In the past hundred years, the French working class has inherited the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune, breaking through the various shackles and suppressions of revisionism and opportunism. They have fought bravely, time and time again, against French monopoly capital, for their own rights, against fascist invaders, and against American imperialism and its agents in France. Through these struggles, they have become stronger and stronger. The large-scale strike struggles they have recently launched fully demonstrate the new awakening and great power of the French working class. The development of the French proletarian revolutionary cause is unstoppable.

    法国工人阶级的革命传统
    法国工人群众最近掀起了波澜壮阔的罢工斗争浪潮，表现了无产阶级的革命本色。
    法国工人阶级具有悠久的光荣的革命传统。
    一八七一年三月，巴黎的工人高举无产阶级革命的红旗，发动了英勇的武装起义，进行了“无产阶级革命打碎资产阶级国家机器的第一次尝试”，创立了人类历史上第一个无产阶级专政的政权——巴黎公社。
    为了保卫巴黎公社，巴黎的工人群众面对疯狂的资产阶级的凡尔赛匪帮，毫不畏惧，前赴后继，浴血奋战。许许多多先烈在高呼“公社万岁”的口号声中壮烈牺牲。
    国际无产阶级的伟大导师马克思曾经热情地赞扬巴黎的工人阶级说：“这些巴黎人具有何等的灵活性，何等的历史主动性，何等的自我牺牲精神呀！……历史上还没有过这种英勇奋斗的实例！”巴黎公社的英雄们为全世界无产阶级创立了永不磨灭的历史功勋，树立了光辉灿烂的革命榜样。
    近百年来，法国工人阶级继承了巴黎公社的光荣革命传统，冲破了修正主义、机会主义的种种束缚和压制，为反对法国垄断资本、争取切身权利，为反对法西斯侵略者，为反对美帝国主义及其在法国的代理人，展开了一次又一次的英勇斗争，并在斗争中锻炼得越来越坚强。他们最近掀起的大规模的罢工斗争，充分显示了法国工人阶级的新觉醒和强大力量。法国的无产阶级革命事业的发展是不可阻挡的。
