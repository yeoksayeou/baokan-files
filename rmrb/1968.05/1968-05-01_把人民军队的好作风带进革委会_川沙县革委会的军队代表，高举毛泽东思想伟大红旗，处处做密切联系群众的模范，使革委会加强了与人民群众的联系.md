	Bringing the Fine Traditions of the People's Army into the Revolutionary Committee

	The military representatives of the Chuan Sha County Revolutionary Committee, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, serve as models in maintaining close ties with the masses, thereby strengthening the committee's connection with the people.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai: Chairman Mao teaches us, "The most fundamental principle in reforming state organs is to maintain close ties with the masses." The military representatives of the Chuan Sha County Revolutionary Committee in Shanghai, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, serve as models in maintaining close ties with the masses, bringing the fine traditions of the people's army, which closely connects with the masses, into the revolutionary committee, and thereby strengthening the committee's connection with the people.

	During the "January Revolution" storm in Shanghai, the military representatives of the Chuan Sha County Revolutionary Committee stood firmly on the side of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, establishing a deep bond of friendship with the people. After joining the Chuan Sha County Revolutionary Committee, they frequently study Chairman Mao's teachings on maintaining close ties with the masses and correctly handling relations with the masses. They consciously struggle against non-proletarian thoughts that hinder ties with the masses. Tao Yu Zhang, the chairman of the Chuan Sha County Revolutionary Committee and the political commissar of the county's people's armed forces department, once faced criticism from some students while handling an issue. Initially, he found it hard to accept. But he immediately recalled Chairman Mao's teaching, "Listen carefully to the voices of the masses," and calmed down, sincerely listening to the criticisms from the revolutionary youngsters. Later, he repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teaching, "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people," and conducted a serious self-examination of his erroneous thoughts. After that, he often proactively sought out the masses to humbly accept their criticisms. The military representatives of the Chuan Sha County Revolutionary Committee also frequently study Chairman Mao's works together with the masses, engage in heart-to-heart talks, and discuss work together. They draw nourishment from the masses' suggestions, continually strengthening their mass perspective and better adhering to the mass line.

	Chairman Mao teaches us, "We must never leave the masses. In this way, we can know the masses, understand the masses, and work together with the masses, thus serving the people well." The military representatives of the Chuan Sha County Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's teaching, frequently proactively go among the masses to listen to their voices. They attach great importance to receiving visitors from the masses and handling their letters, viewing this work as an important channel for maintaining ties with the masses. Previously, the original county committee and county people's committee adopted an arrogant attitude towards visitors and letters from the masses. Now, the military representatives and other standing committee members of the revolutionary committee often personally receive visitors from the masses and handle their letters. Many issues are discovered and resolved in a timely manner through receiving visitors and handling letters from the masses. The military representatives also frequently lead the way in going deep into the grassroots, widely contacting the masses, and holding various meetings among the masses to timely understand and grasp the trends of class struggle. Under the unified leadership of the revolutionary committee, they lead the broad masses to continuously launch attacks on the enemies of the proletariat.

	The military representatives of the Chuan Sha County Revolutionary Committee, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching, "Military cadres must help local cadres, and local cadres must also help military cadres," while humbly learning from revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses, also pay attention to supporting and helping revolutionary cadres and representatives of the revolutionary masses in their political and ideological aspects, better playing their role as backbones in the revolutionary committee. The military representatives also frequently study Chairman Mao's teaching, "Be both an 'official' and a commoner," and Chairman Mao's teaching on the five conditions for successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, ensuring that after joining the revolutionary committee, they still maintain the character of ordinary laborers, frequently returning to their units or production teams to participate in collective labor.

	Over the past year, under the leadership of the military representatives, the Chuan Sha County Revolutionary Committee has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, continually promoting their own ideological revolutionization, making Chairman Mao's great teaching on maintaining close ties with the masses take root in their minds and be implemented in practice. Now, under the leadership of the military representatives, the Chuan Sha County Revolutionary Committee has strengthened its connection with the people. The revolutionary committee is advancing together with the broad masses, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and striving forward to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　把人民军队的好作风带进革委会
    川沙县革委会的军队代表，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，处处做密切联系群众的模范，使革委会加强了与人民群众的联系
    据新华社上海电毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”上海市川沙县革命委员会的军队代表，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，处处做密切联系群众的模范，把人民军队和人民群众紧密相连的优良作风带进革命委员会，使革命委员会加强了与人民群众的联系。
    川沙县革命委员会的军队代表在上海“一月革命”风暴中，坚定地站在无产阶级革命派一边，和人民群众建立了血肉相连的战斗友谊。他们参加川沙县革命委员会以后，经常地学习毛主席关于密切联系群众、正确对待群众的教导，自觉地同妨碍联系群众的非无产阶级思想作斗争。川沙县革委会主任委员、县人民武装部政委陶玉章，有一天在处理一个问题时，有些学生批评了他。开始，他有点接受不了。但他立即想起了毛主席“细心地倾听群众的呼声”的教导，马上冷静下来，诚恳地听取革命小将们的批评。事后，他反复学习毛主席“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”的教导，对自己的错误思想进行了认真的检查。在这以后，他经常主动地到群众中虚心听取批评。川沙县革命委员会的军队代表还经常同群众一起学习毛主席著作，一起交心谈心，一起研究工作，从群众提出的意见中汲取营养，不断加强群众观点，更好地坚持群众路线。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们任何时候都不要离开群众。这样，我们就可能知道群众，了解群众，同群众一道，也就可能好好地为人民服务。”川沙县革委会的军队代表，遵照毛主席的这一教导，经常主动地到群众中去倾听群众的呼声。他们非常重视接待群众来访和处理群众来信，把这一工作看成是联系群众的重要渠道。过去，原县委、县人委对群众来访和来信采取老爷式的态度。现在，参加革委会的军队代表和其他常委，经常亲自接待群众来访，亲自处理群众来信。很多问题都是通过接待群众来访、处理群众来信及时发现和及时解决的。军队代表还经常带头深入基层，广泛接触群众，在群众中召开各种座谈会，及时了解和掌握阶级斗争的动向，在革命委员会统一领导下，带领广大群众，不停顿地向无产阶级的敌人发动进攻。
    川沙县革委会的军队代表，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“军队干部必须帮助地方干部，地方干部也必须帮助军队干部”的教导，在虚心向革命干部和革命群众学习的同时，也注意从政治思想上支持和帮助革命干部和革命群众的代表，更好地发挥他们在革委会中的骨干作用。军队代表还和革命群众的代表经常一起学习毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，学习毛主席关于无产阶级革命事业接班人五个条件的教导，使他们在参加革委会后，仍然保持普通劳动者的本色，经常回到本单位、本生产队参加集体劳动。
    一年来，川沙县革委会在军队代表的带动下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛泽东思想，不断促进自己的思想革命化，使毛主席关于密切联系群众的伟大教导，扎根在脑子里，贯彻到实践中。现在，川沙县革命委员会在军队代表的带动下，加强了与人民群众的联系。革委会正和广大群众一起，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席最新指示，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋勇前进。
