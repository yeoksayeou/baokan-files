	Members of the Nanchang Municipal Revolutionary Committee have been at the forefront of the struggle against class enemies. They act as both commanders and fighters. They go deep into the grassroots to mobilize and organize the masses, and together with the broad revolutionary masses, they continuously carry out revolutionary criticism, launch a fierce attack on the enemies of the proletariat, and accurately, fiercely, and steadily strike at a handful of class enemies. This has further developed the excellent situation of revolution and production, making the revolutionary committee stronger in the storm of class struggle and becoming a strong command center leading the masses to charge against class enemies.

	Revolutionary criticism is a weapon for launching a fierce attack on class enemies. After going deep into the grassroots, the leaders of the revolutionary committee armed the masses with Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle," and adopted the method of grasping typical cases to set up models for revolutionary criticism, using points to influence the whole. Nanchang Glass Factory No. 2 was one of the first typical cases grasped by the municipal revolutionary committee. After the revolutionary committee was established in this factory, revolution and production were carried out vigorously. However, in a workshop where a capitalist-roader was sent down for labor, Chairman Mao's strategic deployment could not be implemented. What was the problem? Under the leadership of the municipal revolutionary committee, the factory mobilized the masses to launch a wave of revolutionary criticism. This immediately exposed the class struggle in that workshop. It turned out that the unrepentant capitalist-roader had secretly placed a handful of landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements in the workshop to control the leadership, attempting to split the ranks of the working class and sabotage the newly born revolutionary committee. "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." The masses opened their eyes, and a handful of class enemies immediately fell into the vast sea of the masses. At the mass exposure and criticism meeting of the entire factory, revolutionary big-character posters and angry denunciations were like sharp arrows, striking at the enemy and smashing the counter-revolutionary restoration activities of a handful of class enemies. Through this struggle, it deeply educated some of the masses who had been deceived in the past. They said painfully: Forgetting class and class struggle will make us lose the power in the hands of the working class. This is a profound lesson.

	Using Nanchang Glass Factory No. 2 as a model, the municipal revolutionary committee organized all units in the city to link up with the actual class struggle in their own units for a big comparison and study. Through study and comparison, the broad masses saw that in the new situation, class struggle is still centered around "power." Therefore, it is necessary to closely combine the actual class struggle, carry out revolutionary criticism deeply and persistently, and fiercely strike at class enemies to defend the proletarian power.

	Where the class struggle is most complex and sharp, the leaders of the municipal revolutionary committee set up their battle positions there. They lead the revolutionary masses to launch a big criticism and struggle against class enemies, digging out the hidden class enemies one by one, criticizing them to the point of being completely exposed, and striking them down completely.

    南昌市革委会成员深入基层
    抓典型  树样板  推动革命大批判
    据新华社南昌电　南昌市革命委员会的成员们在狠抓阶级斗争当中始终站在第一线，既当指挥员，又当战斗员。他们深入基层发动和组织群众，同广大革命群众一道，持续地开展革命大批判，猛烈地向无产阶级的敌人进攻，准、狠、稳地打击一小撮阶级敌人，进一步发展了革命和生产的大好形势，使革命委员会在阶级斗争风浪中越战越强，成为带领广大群众向阶级敌人冲锋陷阵的坚强指挥部。
    革命的大批判是向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻的武器。革命委员会领导成员深入基层以后，用毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导武装群众，并且采用抓典型的办法，大树革命大批判的样板，以点带面，推动全盘。南昌玻璃二厂是市革命委员会最早抓的一个典型。这个厂革命委员会建立后，革命、生产搞得轰轰烈烈，唯独厂内一个走资派下放劳动的一个车间，毛主席的战略部署落实不了。问题在哪里？在市革命委员会的领导下，这个厂放手发动群众，掀起了革命大批判的热潮。这样，一下子就揭开了那个车间阶级斗争的盖子。原来死不悔改的走资派在车间安插的一小撮地、富、反、坏分子，暗中控制了车间的领导权，妄图分裂工人阶级队伍，妄图搞垮新诞生的革命委员会。“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”群众擦亮了眼睛，一小撮阶级敌人立刻陷入了群众的汪洋大海之中。在全厂群众的大揭发大批判会上，革命的大字报，愤怒的声讨，象支支利箭，射向了敌人，粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人搞反革命复辟的罪恶活动。通过这场斗争，深深教育了过去被蒙蔽的一些群众。他们痛心地说：忘记了阶级和阶级斗争，就会丢掉我们工人阶级手里的印把子。这是一次最深刻的教训。
    以玻璃二厂这个典型为样板，市革命委员会组织全市各单位，联系本单位阶级斗争的实际，进行大对比大学习。通过学习和对比，使广大群众看到，新形势下的阶级斗争，仍然是围绕着“政权”进行的，因此必须紧密结合阶级斗争的实际，把革命的大批判深入持久地开展下去，狠狠地打击阶级敌人，保卫无产阶级的政权。
    哪里阶级斗争最复杂最尖锐，市革命委员会领导成员就把自己的战斗岗位设在哪里。他们带领革命群众向阶级敌人展开大批判大斗争，把暗藏的阶级敌人一个一个挖了出来，批得他们体无完肤，打得他们落花流水。
