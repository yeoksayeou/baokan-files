Tanggu Saltworks in Hebei Province, with the assistance of the stationed People's Liberation Army, has achieved remarkable results in both revolution and production by putting revolution in command of production.

The Revolutionary Committee of Tanggu Saltworks, during the preparatory work for salt production in the previous months, organized extensive study classes on Mao Zedong Thought throughout the works. Based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought, they further consolidated and developed revolutionary great alliance and the three-in-one combination. As they entered the busy season of spring salt harvesting in April, the Revolutionary Committee and the stationed People's Liberation Army proposed that the more busy they were, the more they should prioritize the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works in all their work. The socialist enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary masses soared to unprecedented heights. On the basis of overfulfilling the first quarter's production plan, they completed the April salt production plan ten days ahead of schedule. This production level is several times higher than the same period in the past three years. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　塘沽盐场用革命统帅生产
    四月份生产计划提前完成
    河北省塘沽盐场革命委员会在驻场解放军的帮助下，以革命统帅生产，取得了抓革命、促生产的显著成绩。
    塘沽盐场革委会早在前几个月进行原盐生产准备工作期间，就在全场大办毛泽东思想学习班，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上进一步巩固和发展了革命大联合、革命三结合。进入四月份原盐春晒的大忙季节，革委会和驻场解放军提出，越忙越要把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位。广大革命群众的社会主义积极性空前高涨，在超额完成第一季度生产计划的基础上，又提前十一天完成了四月份原盐生产计划，比最近三年来的同期生产水平都有了成倍的增长。（据新华社讯）
