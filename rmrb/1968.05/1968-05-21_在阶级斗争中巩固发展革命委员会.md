Our great leader Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most, relies on the masses the most, and respects the masses' spirit of initiative the most. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary committees that have emerged are a new thing. Chairman Mao has given them full affirmation and great support. Chairman Mao said: "'Three-in-one' revolutionary committees are a creation of the working class and the people in this cultural revolution." Chairman Mao supports them, and we proletarian revolutionaries have always been fighting to cherish, support, consolidate, and develop the revolutionary committee in our mill.

The revolutionary committee is the command post for the proletariat to fight against the bourgeoisie. The class enemies fear it the most and hate it the most. They will inevitably try to sabotage it with double the ferocity. After our mill's revolutionary committee was established, a handful of traitors, spies, and diehard capitalist-roaders within the mill secretly spread poisonous winds and set off ghost fires, using all sorts of despicable means in an attempt to overthrow the mill's revolutionary committee. One capitalist-roader slandered the revolutionary committee's efforts to purify and consolidate the class ranks as "implementing a new bourgeois reactionary line" and maliciously incited some misled masses to oppose the revolutionary committee. A traitor secretly fomented counter-revolutionary economic opportunism and anarchism, inciting the masses to slack off in their work in an attempt to overthrow the revolutionary committee by disrupting production; he even went so far as to say that slacking off was a "revolutionary action" and a demonstration against the "new bourgeois reactionary line."

However, as the extremely important article "A Document of Epoch-Making Significance" points out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has mobilized the people to the fullest extent. The broad revolutionary masses are all concerned with the question of consolidating proletarian dictatorship and are actively participating in the dictatorship over the class enemies." The proletarian revolutionaries in our mill analyzed the enemy situation and deeply realized that a handful of class enemies, by directing their spearheads at the mill's revolutionary committee, were actually aiming at Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and attempting to negate the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We firmly stood on the side of the newly born revolutionary committee and launched a fierce counterattack against the class enemies.

We held several struggle and criticism meetings for the entire mill, exposing the current counter-revolutionary activities of the capitalist-roaders and traitors and spies. Through exposure and struggle, we revealed their wolfish ambitions to sow discord between the masses and the revolutionary committee and to overthrow the revolutionary committee. Each workshop also launched a heated revolutionary criticism campaign against the various fallacies spread by the class enemies, eliminating their poisonous influence, boosting the morale of the proletarian revolutionaries, and crushing the arrogance of the class enemies. We enthusiastically responded to the call of the mill's revolutionary committee and organized production promotion teams in each workshop, serving as both revolutionary vanguards and production pioneers, thoroughly smashing the class enemies' plot to sabotage the revolutionary committee by disrupting production.

Uniting and educating the vast majority of cadres and masses is a very important political task in cherishing and consolidating the revolutionary committee. To help the cadres who have made mistakes and the masses who have been misled to return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as soon as possible, we, in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instruction to "hold study classes, which is a good way to solve many problems," assisted the mill's revolutionary committee in setting up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the workshops and work teams. Through studying Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions and the "Three Constantly Read Articles," and through criticizing and repudiating revisionism and criticizing and repudiating oneself, the cadres who have made mistakes and the misled masses further raised their awareness of the struggle between the two lines. We also, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching to "carry out heart-to-heart talks, which is a very good method," went to the homes of the cadres who have made mistakes and the misled masses, had heart-to-heart talks with them, and studied Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions together. The cadres who have made mistakes and the misled class brothers awakened one after another under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought.

Since the revolutionary committee is a new thing, it is not surprising that, like other new things, it may encounter this or that shortcoming and mistake in its forward march. Regarding the shortcomings and mistakes of the revolutionary committee, we proletarian revolutionaries should, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teaching that "the shortcomings of the people need to be criticized, ... but one must speak from the standpoint of the people, with the fervent enthusiasm of protecting and educating the people," give benevolent criticism and help. A worker-turned vice-chairman of our mill's revolutionary committee, after joining the revolutionary leading cadre group, relaxed his ideological remolding for a period of time, became rough in his speech, grew short-tempered, and went to the workshops less often to work. We felt that his change was a bad sign, so we, together with the members of the revolutionary committee, helped him. He voluntarily exposed his private thoughts and criticized himself in front of the masses, accepted the masses' criticism and help, and appeared before the masses as an ordinary laborer. The revolutionary masses reacted very positively to him. Through this incident, the other members of the revolutionary committee also received a profound education. They strove to study Chairman Mao's works, often went deep among the masses, and, together with the masses, vigorously promoted revolution and vigorously promoted production, making the revolutionary committee a strong command post for fighting against the class enemies.

    在阶级斗争中巩固发展革命委员会
    贵阳棉纺厂无产阶级革命派
    我们伟大领袖毛主席，最相信群众，最依靠群众，最尊重群众的首创精神。在无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出来的革命委员会这个新事物，毛主席给予了充分的肯定和极大的支持。毛主席说：“‘三结合’的革命委员会，是工人阶级和人民群众在这次文化大革命中的一种创造。”毛主席支持我支持。我们无产阶级革命派就一直为爱护、支持、巩固和发展我厂的革命委员会而斗争。
    革命委员会是无产阶级对资产阶级进行战斗的指挥部，阶级敌人最怕它，也最恨它。他们必然要以百倍的疯狂进行破坏。我厂革委会建立以后，厂里的一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派，就暗地里煽阴风，点鬼火，采取种种卑鄙手段，妄图整垮厂革委会。有个走资派把革委会纯洁和巩固阶级队伍诬蔑为“执行新的资产阶级反动路线”，并别有用心地挑动部分不明真相的群众反对革委会。一个叛徒竟偷偷摸摸煽动反革命经济主义妖风和无政府主义，挑动群众消极怠工，妄图用破坏生产的办法整垮厂革委会；还胡说什么消极怠工是“革命行动”，是向“新的资产阶级反动路线示威”。
    但是，正如《划时代的文献》这篇极其重要的文章所指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，把人民群众最充分地发动起来了。广大革命群众，都在关心巩固无产阶级政权的大问题，积极参加对阶级敌人的专政。”我厂无产阶级革命派分析了敌情，深刻地认识到，一小撮阶级敌人把矛头指向厂革命委员会，就是指向毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是妄图否定无产阶级文化大革命。我们坚定地站在新生的革命委员会一边，向阶级敌人发起了猛烈的还击。
    我们多次召开了全厂的批判斗争大会，大揭走资派和叛徒、特务的现行反革命活动。通过揭发斗争，暴露了他们挑拨群众与革委会的关系，妄图颠覆革委会的狼子野心。各车间也针对阶级敌人散布的种种谬论，展开了热火朝天的革命大批判，肃清其流毒，大长无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭阶级敌人的威风。我们热烈响应厂革委会的号召，在各车间组织了抓革命促生产突击队，既当革命先锋，又当生产闯将，彻底粉碎了阶级敌人用破坏生产来破坏革委会的阴谋。
    团结和教育绝大多数干部和群众，是爱护和巩固革委会的一项十分重大的政治任务。为了使犯错误的干部和受蒙蔽的群众尽快地回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，我们遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的最新指示，协助厂革委会在车间、工段，举办了各种不同类型的毛泽东思想学习班。通过学习毛主席一系列最新指示和“老三篇”，通过斗私批修，犯错误的干部和受蒙蔽的群众，进一步提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟。我们还遵照毛主席“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好”的教导，到犯错误的干部和受蒙蔽的群众的家里，同他们谈心，一起学习毛主席一系列最新指示。犯错误的干部和受蒙蔽的阶级弟兄，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，纷纷觉醒过来。
    革命委员会既然是一个新生事物，它和其他新生事物一样，在前进的道路上，可能出现这样或那样的缺点和错误，这是毫不奇怪的。对于革委会的缺点错误，我们无产阶级革命派，应该遵照毛主席“对于人民的缺点是需要批评的，……但必须是真正站在人民的立场上，用保护人民、教育人民的满腔热情来说话”的伟大教导，善意地进行批评和帮助。我们厂革委会有个工人出身的副主任，参加革命领导班子后，有一段时间放松了思想改造，说话口气粗了，脾气变大了，到车间劳动少了。我们感到他的变化是一个不好的苗头，就和革委会成员一道，共同帮助他。他主动到群众中亮私斗私，接受群众批评帮助，以一个普通劳动者的姿态出现在群众中，革命群众对他反应很好。通过这件事，革委会其他成员也受到一次深刻的教育，他们努力学习毛主席著作，经常深入群众，和群众一起狠抓革命，猛促生产，使革委会成为向阶级敌人进行战斗的坚强指挥部。
