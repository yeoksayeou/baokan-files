“Winds and rains rise over Mount Zhong, a million heroes cross the Yangtze.” Under the loving care of the great leader Chairman Mao, and guided by his series of most recent instructions, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, the Red Guards, and the broad revolutionary masses in Jiangsu Province have engaged in a prolonged, repeated, and intense struggle against the clique of revisionists within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, and their agents in Jiangsu, Jiang Yiqing and Chen Guang, shattering their dreams of restoring capitalism in Jiangsu. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has ushered in an unprecedentedly good situation, with revolutionary committees springing up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. The radiant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the entire Jiangsu region.

Over the past year, the troops stationed in Jiangsu have resolutely responded to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to “support the broad masses of the left,” hoisted high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and sent countless soldiers to the frontlines of class struggle. They have fought shoulder to shoulder with the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat, breathing the same air and sharing the same fate, and have made outstanding contributions to the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The year-long struggle has made the troops stationed in Jiangsu deeply realize that only by closely following the great leader Chairman Mao and, together with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses, continuously and proactively launching powerful attacks on the class enemies, can we achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

To fight a good offensive battle of class struggle, we must closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao and firmly grasp the initiative in class struggle.

Jiangsu is a key region in southeastern China. The Kuomintang reactionaries once used the provincial capital Nanjing as their base for bloody rule. After liberation, the clique of revisionists within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, and their agents in Jiangsu, have relentlessly pushed the revisionist line, engaging in counter-revolutionary restoration activities. Class struggle in the Jiangsu region has always been extremely sharp and complex.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat to criticize and repudiate the bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China, led by Mao Zedong, and the revolutionary people of the whole country, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.” In this sharp class struggle, the troops stationed in Jiangsu deeply understand that the great leader Chairman Mao's most recent instructions most profoundly explain the great significance of the Cultural Revolution and most deeply reveal its class content. Our execution of the “Three Supports, Two Militaries” tasks is to support the broad revolutionary masses in fighting political battles against the bourgeoisie, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the agents of the bourgeoisie and the Kuomintang reactionaries who have infiltrated our Party. In this sharp, complex, and intense class struggle, to closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, we must proactively fight a good offensive battle of class struggle and always grasp the initiative in class struggle.

Over the past year, the troops stationed in Jiangsu have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Whatever Chairman Mao says, they do; whatever the proletarian headquarters, headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, commands, they fight. The deeper the Cultural Revolution develops, the more intense the class struggle in the Jiangsu region becomes, and the more closely and consciously the troops stationed in Jiangsu follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. When Chairman Mao issued the great call to “Fire upon the Headquarters,” the troops stationed in Jiangsu immediately followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly standing on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They first supported the revolutionary masses of the proletariat at Nanjing University in launching a fierce attack against the bourgeois reactionary line pushed by the old Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, quickly spreading the blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout every corner of Jiangsu. At a crucial moment in the life-and-death struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in the Jiangsu region, Chairman Mao's most recent instructions were issued during his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China. The broad cadres and soldiers immediately sprang into action, sparing no effort, going deep among the masses, and vigorously propagating and implementing Chairman Mao's most recent instructions. They hoisted high the great banner of “Supporting the Army and Loving the People,” resolutely exposing the evil plots of a handful of class enemies to sabotage revolutionary great unity and sow discord between the army and the people. The army and the people united, taking the initiative to attack, quickly exposed a handful of revisionists and black hands, and the revolutionary situation made rapid progress, achieving a decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

To closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, deeply launch a revolutionary criticism, and always direct the spearhead at the handful of revisionists, traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries within the Party. The main target of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is the handful of revisionists within the Party. In executing the “Three Supports, Two Militaries” tasks, the troops stationed in Jiangsu first use Mao Zedong Thought to support the broad revolutionary masses in criticizing China's Khrushchev and his agents in various parts of Jiangsu, criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line they pushed. In Yancity, China's Khrushchev once spread poison there more than twenty years ago, and the infamous “Black Cultivation” was also revised and released there. The cadres and soldiers of the troops, together with the revolutionary masses, verbally and in writing condemned China's Khrushchev, and held an exhibition of China's Khrushchev's crimes in Yancity, thoroughly exposing the skin of this old counter-revolutionary. In Wuxi, they resolutely supported the revolutionary masses in fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev and his henchmen's plot to turn Wuxi into a “black model” for restoring capitalism. The cadres and soldiers followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions, going deep into the grassroots, helping the broad revolutionary masses to direct their class hatred towards traitors, spies, unrepentant revisionists, and untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and never directing the spearhead at their class brothers and revolutionary masses, confusing the two types of contradictions. They firmly grasped this revolutionary direction, united the broad masses, isolated and struck at a handful of class enemies, and continuously consolidated and developed revolutionary great unity in the struggle.

To closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we must continuously analyze the new situation of class struggle, closely watch the new moves of the class enemies, and engage in a struggle of counterattack against them. Class enemies will never accept defeat. “They are always studying strategies to deal with us, ‘observing the direction,’ seeking an opportunity to act.” The broad cadres and soldiers of the troops stationed in Jiangsu always remember Chairman Mao's teaching to “never forget class struggle,” using Chairman Mao's most recent instructions as weapons, fully mobilizing the masses, and actively and proactively launching attacks on the class enemies. A handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant revisionists, and all counter-revolutionaries, seeing that the broad revolutionary masses have been fully mobilized, found it more difficult to engage in open counter-revolutionary activities. They adopted more hidden and cunning methods, using the banner of the “leftists,” wearing the cloak of “old revolutionaries,” using bourgeois factionalism, inserting black hands, inciting armed struggles, creating divisions, and firing cannons at the proletarian headquarters. They also directed their spears at the People's Liberation Army, exerting pressure on the left-supporting troops in various places, attempting to force the left-supporting troops not to implement the Central Committee's repeated instructions on the Jiangsu issue and deviate from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Facing the fierce counterattack of the class enemies, the troops stationed in Jiangsu used Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the new situation of class struggle, exposed the plots and tricks of a handful of class enemies, and withstood the stormy winds. They resolutely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, under the direct command of the proletarian headquarters, headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, launching proactive attacks on the class enemies. They used Chairman Mao's series of most recent instructions to guide the masses to distinguish between enemies and ourselves, jointly opposing the enemies, and smashed the class enemies' plots of sabotage. The entire province quickly achieved revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and the Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Committee was born in the stormy winds of class struggle.

After the birth of the revolutionary committees, the troops stationed in Jiangsu carefully analyzed the rightist wind of rehabilitation stirred up by the enemy, and helped the revolutionary committees lead the masses in launching sustained attacks on the class enemies, striking back at the rightist wind of rehabilitation. They struck from a high vantage point, like a sharp knife cutting through bamboo, hitting the target accurately, hitting hard, hitting steadily, and hitting the class enemies so hard that they couldn't breathe or turn over. The entire Jiangsu region became a battlefield for the “people's war” of revolutionary criticism, greatly boosting the morale of the proletariat and greatly demoralizing the bourgeoisie. At the same time, they cooperated with the revolutionary masses to strike at speculators, hooligans, and other bad elements who disrupted social order, and strengthened revolutionary order. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line was deeply rooted in people's hearts, and the revolutionary committees were further consolidated.

To fight a good offensive battle of class struggle, we must arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought and build a strong proletarian revolutionary force.

Chairman Mao teaches us: “We must lead the people to defeat the enemy. Our troops must be well-organized, and our steps must be coordinated. The soldiers must be elite, and the weapons must be good.” In the “Three Supports, Two Militaries” work, to proactively and continuously launch attacks on the class enemies, the troops stationed in Jiangsu always focus on arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought and continuously strengthening the construction of the proletarian revolutionary force.

Building a proletarian revolutionary force is fundamentally about focusing on ideological construction. Chairman Mao says: “We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks onto the track of the proletarian revolution. This is a key problem for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.” Grasp this key, and the broad revolutionary masses can closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and unite to launch attacks on the class enemies. The revolutionary situation will develop like a surging torrent.

Since last October, the troops stationed in Jiangsu have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's most recent instructions on holding extensive study classes, holding and running good Mao Zedong Thought study classes, fully mobilizing the masses to voluntarily revolutionize, and launching offensive battles against all non-proletarian thoughts in their minds. The broad cadres and soldiers, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and deep proletarian feelings of love for the broad revolutionary masses, helped the revolutionary masses set up tens of thousands of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The spring breeze of Mao Zedong Thought blew through every household. As soon as Chairman Mao's most recent instructions met the broad masses, they quickly turned into the conscious actions of the broad revolutionary masses, powerfully promoting the ideological revolution of the people.

Building a proletarian revolutionary force must focus on class education and the education of the two-line struggle. The two-line struggle within the Party is the concentrated reflection of class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat. If we do not help the broad revolutionary masses raise their awareness of the two-line struggle, they cannot consciously defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the complicated class struggle. Therefore, the broad cadres and soldiers of the troops stationed in Jiangsu, together with the broad revolutionary masses, focused on class education and the education of the two-line struggle in the study classes, extensively launching “remember and compare” activities: remembering the bitterness of the old society and comparing the sweetness of the new society; remembering the bitterness of the bourgeois reactionary line and comparing the sweetness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Through the “remember and compare” activities, the broad revolutionary masses aroused boundless hatred for China's Khrushchev and the bourgeois reactionary line he pushed, greatly enhancing their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In Nanjing, some revolutionary masses who were once severely opposed to each other, through studying Chairman Mao's most recent instructions together at the Rainflower Terrace Martyrs' Cemetery, remembering the glorious deeds of the revolutionary martyrs, and talking about their fighting experiences in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, their class brothers' hearts were closely united on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and they directed their spears together at a handful of class enemies.

Building a proletarian revolutionary force must prioritize the construction of the workers' force and fully play the leading role of the working class. The working class listens to Chairman Mao the most and resolutely implements Chairman Mao's most recent instructions. The workers of Nanjing, with a glorious revolutionary fighting tradition, under the help of the troops, repeatedly studied and implemented Chairman Mao's most recent instructions, first achieving revolutionary great unity, setting a shining example for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat throughout the province, and powerfully promoting the revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination in various places throughout the province. The revolutionary masses of the Jipushan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory once engaged in “internal wars” for a while, neglecting the struggle against the revisionists within the Party. The left-supporting personnel of the troops organized the revolutionary workers to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teaching to “never forget class struggle,” launching continuous attacks on a handful of class enemies. The broad revolutionary masses fought shoulder to shoulder, their morale growing stronger and stronger, and their ranks growing firmer and firmer. It is proven that wherever the leading role of the working class is valued, and the class force of the working class is built in the stormy winds of class struggle, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can be better, and Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment can be more closely followed.

Building a proletarian revolutionary force must focus on the ideological and organizational construction of the leadership core of the revolutionary force. As the Cultural Revolution deepens, the class enemies always try to use the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts in the revolutionary force to infiltrate, pull out, and even use “heart-piercing tactics” to infiltrate the core of our force, attempting to destroy the proletarian revolutionary force from within. In the ideological construction of the revolutionary force, the troops stationed in Jiangsu specially helped various revolutionary mass organizations and various levels of revolutionary committees to achieve ideological and organizational revolutionization. They believed that in the midst of victory songs, applause, and drumbeats, they must be especially vigilant against the “sugar-coated bullets” and other plots of sabotage by the class enemies. On the second day after the establishment of the Jiangsu Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the military responsible comrades participating in the revolutionary “three-in-one combination” immediately led the standing committee of the revolutionary committee to hold the first session of the Mao Zedong Thought study class, studying Chairman Mao's teachings on carrying the revolution through to the end, overcoming rightist complacency, enhancing the awareness of class struggle, and better leading the revolutionary people of the entire province to launch larger-scale attacks on the class enemies.

To fight a good offensive battle of class struggle, we must unify the army with Mao Zedong Thought and first make ourselves correct.

Chairman Mao teaches us: “The struggle of the proletariat and the revolutionary people to change the world includes the task of realizing the following: changing the objective world and also changing our subjective world.” In the practical work of the “Three Supports, Two Militaries,” the troops stationed in Jiangsu have realized that to fight a good offensive battle of class struggle with the revolutionary masses, we must continuously change our subjective world in the struggle and first make ourselves correct. Only by truly understanding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao can we distinguish between enemies and ourselves, distinguish between right and wrong, identify the revolutionary targets, clarify the revolutionary direction, stand firmly on the revolutionary position, and thus truly make the army a strong pillar of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Otherwise, we will deviate from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the “Three Supports, Two Militaries” work will go astray.

To make ourselves correct, we must unify the army with Mao Zedong Thought and firmly stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an extremely sharp and complex class struggle, and the situation changes rapidly. Under such circumstances, how can we make the entire army united and coordinated? The troops stationed in Jiangsu, following the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin: “The situation of the entire army is very complex, with various different situations, but in this regard, it is both complex and not complex, both different and not different, that is, all must be unified with Mao Zedong Thought.” In the “Three Supports, Two Militaries” work, they continuously, according to the situation of class struggle and the active thoughts of the troops, strengthened the education of the two-line struggle in the struggle, first focusing on the education of the leading cadres at all levels. Through small rectification and short-term training, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle, the mass line, and his series of most recent instructions on the Cultural Revolution, continuously understanding and grasping Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, methods, and policies on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and raising the awareness of the two-line struggle. Through investigating society, inviting proletarian revolutionaries to give reports in the troops, and other methods, they learned from the revolutionary masses, understood the situation of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, learned the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary masses, and clarified their responsibilities. Through the extensive launch of the “three loyalties” activity of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, they enhanced the self-awareness of the broad cadres and soldiers in implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, aroused boundless love for the broad revolutionary masses, and strong hatred for the class enemies. It is proven that as long as the broad cadres and soldiers are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, no matter how the situation of class struggle changes, the broad cadres and soldiers will always firmly stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, achieving the effect of not being blown off course by the wind, not being shot down by sugar-coated bullets, not bending under pressure, and always being able to resolutely resist interference from the right and the ultra-left, resolutely support the broad leftist masses, and smash the plots of the class enemies.

Chairman Mao says: “Do not be afraid of criticism. The entire army will correctly recognize the world and change the world in this process of criticism.” The broad cadres and soldiers of the troops stationed in Jiangsu consciously regard the surging mass movement as a vast battlefield for criticizing and repudiating oneself and the revisionists, often using Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as a ruler and the opinions of the broad revolutionary masses as a mirror, examining everywhere and in everything the degree of loyalty to Chairman Mao, continuously using Mao Zedong Thought to correct their course. They believed that being able to humbly accept the criticism of the revolutionary masses, promptly correcting the shortcomings and errors in their work, is a loyalty to Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, is a best support for the broad revolutionary masses, and can quickly smash the enemy's evil plots of using some of our work's shortcomings and errors to sow discord between the army and the people. They often went deep among the people, accepting supervision, listening to criticism, and promptly correcting their shortcomings and errors. Through the help and education of the masses, the troops greatly deepened their understanding of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, enhanced the unity between the army and the people, and truly made the troops a strong rear support for the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat to launch attacks on the class enemies.

The broad cadres and soldiers of the troops stationed in Jiangsu, reviewing the year-long struggle, deeply realized that following Chairman Mao step by step and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's most recent instructions is victory. They are determined to even higher hoist the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, insist on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and together with the broad revolutionary masses, continuously and without interruption launch more powerful attacks on the class enemies, seizing a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.

　　紧跟伟大统帅毛主席　主动向阶级敌人进攻
　　——驻江苏部队“三支”“两军”工作的基本经验
    “钟山风雨起苍黄，百万雄师过大江。”在伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀下，在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，江苏省无产阶级革命派、红卫兵小将和广大革命群众，同以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在江苏地区的代理人江渭清、陈光之流，进行了长期的、反复的、激烈的搏斗，粉碎了他们妄图在江苏地区复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦，无产阶级文化大革命出现了空前未有的大好形势，各级革命委员会如雨后春笋般建立起来，毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光照红了整个江苏大地。
    一年多来，驻江苏部队坚决响应伟大统帅毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，千军万马“杀”上阶级斗争第一线，和广大无产阶级革命派同呼吸共命运，并肩战斗，对夺取无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，建立了卓越的功勋。一年多来的斗争实践，使驻江苏部队深深体会到：只有步步紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，和无产阶级革命派、广大革命群众一起，不停顿地、主动地向阶级敌人发起强大进攻，才能夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    打好阶级斗争进攻战，必须紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，牢牢掌握阶级斗争主动权
    江苏是我国东南的重镇。蒋介石反动派曾经把江苏省会南京，作为他们进行血腥统治的反革命巢穴。解放后，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在江苏省的代理人，竭力推行修正主义路线，进行反革命复辟的阴谋活动。江苏地区阶级斗争一直是非常尖锐、非常复杂的。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”江苏驻军在这场尖锐的阶级大搏斗中深深地认识到：我们伟大导师毛主席的最新指示，最精辟地阐明了文化大革命的伟大意义，最深刻地揭示了文化大革命的阶级内容；我们执行“三支”“两军”任务，就是支持广大革命人民群众跟资产阶级打政治仗，跟国民党反动派打政治仗，跟混入我们党内的资产阶级、国民党反动派的代理人打政治仗。在这场尖锐、复杂、激烈的阶级大搏斗中，我们要紧跟伟大统帅毛主席的战略部署，就必须主动打好阶级斗争进攻战，始终掌握阶级斗争的主动权。
    一年多来，江苏驻军紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，毛主席怎么说，他们就怎么做；以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部怎么指挥，他们就怎么战斗。文化大革命越深入发展，江苏地区的阶级斗争越加激化，江苏驻军对毛主席的伟大战略部署就跟得越紧、越自觉。毛主席发出《炮打司令部》的伟大号召，驻江苏部队立即紧紧跟上毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，首先支持南京大学无产阶级革命派向旧江苏省委推行的资产阶级反动路线发起了猛烈的进攻，使无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，迅速燃遍江苏的每个角落。在江苏地区两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线生死搏斗的关键时刻，传来了毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时发出的最新指示，广大指战员闻风而动，全力以赴，深入群众，大力宣传和落实毛主席的最新指示。他们高举“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，坚决揭露一小撮阶级敌人破坏革命大联合、挑拨军民关系的罪恶阴谋。军民团结，主动进攻，把一小撮走资派和黑手很快揪了出来，革命形势突飞猛进，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    要做到紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就要牢牢掌握斗争大方向，深入开展革命大批判，始终把矛头对准党内一小撮走资派、叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子。无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的主要对象是党内一小撮走资派。驻江苏部队在执行“三支”“两军”任务中，首先就是用毛泽东思想支持广大革命群众批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在江苏各地的代理人，批判他们推行的反革命修正主义路线。在盐城，中国赫鲁晓夫二十多年前曾在那里大肆放毒，臭名昭著的黑《修养》也在那里修改出笼。部队指战员和革命群众一起口诛笔伐，愤怒声讨中国赫鲁晓夫，还举办了中国赫鲁晓夫在盐城的罪行展览，狠剥这个老反革命的画皮。在无锡，坚决支持革命群众，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙妄图把无锡变成复辟资本主义“黑样板”的阴谋。指战员们遵循伟大领袖毛主席关于正确区分两类不同性质矛盾的教导，深入基层，帮助广大革命群众把阶级仇恨集中到叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和没有改造好的地富反坏右等一小撮阶级敌人身上，而决不把矛头对准自己的阶级兄弟和革命群众，混淆两类不同性质的矛盾。他们紧紧抓住了这个革命大方向，团结广大群众，孤立和打击了一小撮阶级敌人，使革命的大联合在斗争中不断得到巩固和发展。
    要做到紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就要不断地分析阶级斗争的新形势，密切注意阶级敌人的新动向，同敌人进行针锋相对的斗争。阶级敌人是决不会甘心失败的，“他们老是在研究对付我们的策略，‘窥测方向’，以求一逞”。驻江苏部队广大指战员，时刻牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，以毛主席的最新指示为武器，充分发动群众，积极主动地向阶级敌人进攻。一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和一切反革命分子，看到广大革命群众已充分发动起来，他们明目张胆地进行反革命活动更加困难了，就采用更隐蔽、更狡猾的手法，打着“左派”旗号，披着“老造反”的外衣，利用资产阶级派性，插进黑手，挑动武斗，制造分裂，炮打无产阶级司令部。他们还把矛头指向解放军，向各地支左部队施加压力，妄图迫使支左部队不执行中央关于江苏问题的历次指示，背离毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。面对阶级敌人的猖狂反扑，驻江苏部队用毛泽东思想分析阶级斗争的新形势，识破了一小撮阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，顶住了险风恶浪。他们坚决紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的直接指挥下，向阶级敌人发动主动进攻。他们用毛主席一系列最新指示引导群众分清敌我，共同对敌，粉碎了阶级敌人的破坏阴谋，全省很快实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，江苏省革命委员会在阶级斗争的急风暴雨中诞生了。
    革命委员会诞生后，驻江苏部队认真分析敌人刮起的右倾翻案妖风，又帮助革命委员会带领群众向阶级敌人发动持续的进攻，迎头痛击右倾翻案妖风。他们高屋建瓴，势如破竹，打得准，打得狠，打得稳，打得阶级敌人喘不过气，翻不过身。整个江苏大地，变成了革命大批判的“人民战争”的战场，大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。同时，还配合革命群众，打击了投机倒把、扰乱社会治安的坏人，加强了革命秩序。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加深入人心，革命委员会更加巩固。
    打好阶级斗争进攻战，必须用毛泽东思想武装群众，建设一支坚强的无产阶级革命队伍
    毛主席教导我们：“我们要领导人民打倒敌人，我们的队伍就要整齐，我们的步调就要一致，兵要精，武器要好。”江苏驻军在“三支”“两军”工作中，为了主动地不停顿地向阶级敌人进攻，始终抓紧用毛泽东思想武装群众，不断加强无产阶级革命队伍的建设。
    建设无产阶级革命队伍，最根本的是要抓好思想建设。毛主席说：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”抓住了这个关键，广大革命群众就能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就能齐心合力向阶级敌人发起进攻，革命形势就如滚滚洪流，迅猛向前发展。
    驻江苏部队从去年十月以来，坚决落实毛主席关于大办学习班的最新指示，大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，充分发动群众自觉革命，向头脑中各种非无产阶级思想打进攻战。广大指战员怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚、对广大革命群众无比热爱的深厚无产阶级感情，帮助革命群众办起了数以十万计的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，毛泽东思想的春风吹遍千家万户。毛主席的最新指示一经和广大群众见面，有如春风化雨，迅速化为广大革命群众的自觉行动，有力地促进了人的思想革命化。
    建设无产阶级革命队伍，必须狠抓阶级教育和两条路线斗争教育。党内两条路线斗争是无产阶级专政条件下阶级斗争的集中反映。如果不帮助广大革命群众提高两条路线斗争觉悟，在错综复杂的阶级斗争中就不能自觉地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。因此，驻江苏部队广大指战员，和广大革命群众一起，在学习班里狠抓阶级教育和两条路线斗争教育，广泛开展了忆比活动：忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜；忆资产阶级反动路线的苦，比毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的甜。通过忆比活动，激起了广大革命群众对中国赫鲁晓夫及其所推行的资产阶级反动路线的无比仇恨，大大增强了对伟大领袖毛主席和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的无限热爱。南京有些过去严重对立的革命群众，通过在雨花台烈士墓前同学毛主席最新指示，同忆革命先烈的光辉事迹，同讲在无产阶级文化大革命中的战斗历程，阶级兄弟的心紧紧联结在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，把矛头共同指向了一小撮阶级敌人。
    建设无产阶级革命队伍，必须把工人队伍的建设放在首位，充分发挥工人阶级主力军的作用。工人阶级最听毛主席的话，最坚决执行毛主席的最新指示。具有光荣革命斗争传统的南京工人，在部队帮助下，反复学习和落实毛主席的最新指示，首先实现了革命大联合，为全省无产阶级革命派树立了光辉的榜样，有力地推动了全省各地革命大联合和革命三结合。戚墅堰机车车辆厂的革命群众组织之间曾一度“内战”不休，忽视了对党内走资派的斗争。部队支左人员组织革命职工反复学习毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，对一小撮阶级敌人不断发起进攻。广大革命群众并肩战斗，士气越打越旺盛，队伍越打越坚强。事实证明，哪里重视了工人阶级的领导作用，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中注意建设工人阶级的阶级队伍，哪里就能更好地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，无产阶级文化大革命形势就能越来越好。
    建设无产阶级革命队伍，要着重抓好革命队伍领导核心的思想建设和组织建设。随着文化大革命的深入发展，阶级敌人总是要利用革命队伍中的资产阶级、小资产阶级思想，打进来，拉出去，甚至用“钻心术”，钻进我们队伍中的核心，妄图从内部搞垮无产阶级革命队伍。江苏驻军在抓好革命队伍思想建设中，特别注意帮助各革命群众组织和各级革命委员会实现思想革命化和组织革命化。他们认为，在欢呼胜利的凯歌声中，在一片掌声和锣鼓声中，要特别警惕阶级敌人的“糖衣炮弹”和其他各种阴谋破坏活动。江苏省革命委员会成立的第二天，参加革命“三结合”的军队负责同志，就立即带动革委会常委办起第一期毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席关于将革命进行到底的教导，克服麻痹轻敌的右倾情绪，增强阶级斗争观念，更好地领导全省革命人民，向阶级敌人发起更大规模的进攻。
    打好阶级斗争进攻战，必须用毛泽东思想统一部队，首先要使自己弄正确
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级和革命人民改造世界的斗争，包括实现下述的任务：改造客观世界，也改造自己的主观世界”。驻江苏部队在“三支”“两军”工作实践中体会到，要同革命群众一道打好阶级斗争进攻战，必须在斗争中不断改造主观世界，首先要使自己弄正确。只有自己真正理解了毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，才能分清敌我，分清是非，认清革命对象，明确革命方向，站稳革命立场，从而使军队真正成为无产阶级文化大革命的坚强支柱，否则就会背离毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，使“三支”“两军”工作走到邪路上去。
    要使自己弄正确，必须用毛泽东思想统一部队，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上。无产阶级文化大革命，是一场非常尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，形势变化很快。在这种情况下，怎样才能使全军上下团结一心，步调一致呢？驻江苏部队遵照林副主席的指示：“全军工作情况虽然很复杂，有各种不同的情况，但在这一点上，又复杂又不复杂，又有差别又没有差别，这就是都要用毛泽东思想统一起来。”他们在“三支”“两军”工作中，不断地根据阶级斗争情况和部队的活思想，在斗争中加强两条路线斗争的教育，首先是抓紧各级领导班子的教育。通过小整风和短期训练等办法，反复学习毛主席关于阶级斗争、群众路线的教导和对文化大革命的一系列最新指示，不断理解、掌握毛主席在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，提高两条路线斗争觉悟。通过向社会作调查、邀请无产阶级革命派到部队作报告等办法，拜革命群众为师，了解两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的情况，学习革命群众的革命精神，明确自己的责任；通过普遍开展忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动，增强了广大指战员执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的自觉性，激发起对广大革命群众的无限热爱，对阶级敌人的强烈仇恨。事实证明，只要广大指战员无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，不管阶级斗争形势怎样千变万化，广大指战员总是坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，做到阴风吹不歪，糖弹打不倒，千钧压顶不弯腰，始终能坚决顶住来自右的和极“左”方面的干扰，坚决支持左派广大群众，粉碎阶级敌人的阴谋。
    毛主席说：“不要怕批评，全军在这种批评过程中，将会正确地认识世界，并改造世界。”驻江苏部队广大指战员自觉地把汹涌澎湃的群众运动，当作斗私批修的广阔战场，经常以毛主席的无产阶级革命路线为尺子，以广大革命群众的意见为镜子，处处、事事检验忠于毛主席的程度，不断用毛泽东思想导正自己的航向。他们认为，能够虚心听取革命群众的批评，及时改正工作中的缺点错误，就是对毛主席和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的忠诚，就是对广大革命群众的一种最好支持，就能尽快地粉碎敌人利用我们工作中的某些缺点错误挑拨军民关系的罪恶阴谋。他们经常深入群众，接受监督，听取批评，有了缺点错误立即改正。部队经过群众的帮助教育，大大加深了对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的理解，增强了军民团结，使部队真正成为广大无产阶级革命派向阶级敌人进攻的坚强后盾。
    江苏驻军广大指战员，回顾一年多来的斗争实践，深深体会到：步步紧跟毛主席，坚决落实毛主席的最新指示，就是胜利。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，和广大革命群众一起不停顿地向阶级敌人发起更猛烈的进攻，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
