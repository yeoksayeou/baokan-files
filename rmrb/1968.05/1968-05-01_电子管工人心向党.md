	Every day we go to work and fight,
	The Little Red Book is in our hands,
	We ask the great leader Chairman Mao,
	His words guide our hearts and minds.

	Oil drips drop by drop,
	Nourishing the gears and axles...
	Reading the quotations sentence by sentence,
	Opens our hearts and broadens our vision!

	The wheels spin rapidly,
	Products flow like water,
	Every electron tube,
	Connects to the five continents.

	The hearts of electron tube workers are with the Party,
	Spreading the thoughts of Mao Zedong without rest!

	"Grasp revolution, promote production,"
	Chairman Mao's teachings are in our hearts.
	Riding the winds and breaking the waves,
	We rely on Mao Zedong Thought to steer our course;
	Conquering the frontiers,
	We rely on Mao Zedong Thought to command the battle!

	Wherever Mao Zedong Thought is spread,
	There a revolutionary storm is stirred;
	Every order from Chairman Mao,
	Makes the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries tremble!

	The Little Red Book is in our hands,
	His words guide our hearts and minds;
	Step by step we follow Chairman Mao,
	The red sun shines over the entire globe!

　　电子管工人心向党
　　顾顺章
　　咱每天上工去战斗，
　　红色宝书握在手，
　　请示伟大导师毛主席，
　　话儿领着心儿走。
　　油一滴滴流，
　　滋润着齿轮、车轴……
　　语录一句句读，
　　使咱心胸开阔，放眼全球！
　　车轮在飞转，
　　产品如水流，
　　每只电子管，
　　连着五大洲。
　　电子管工人心向党，
　　传播毛泽东思想永不休！
　　“抓革命，促生产”，
　　毛主席的教导记心头。
　　乘风破浪，
　　靠毛泽东思想拨正航向；
　　攻克尖端，
　　靠毛泽东思想指挥战斗！
　　毛泽东思想传到那里，
　　那里就掀起革命风暴；
　　毛主席的每一个号令，
　　都使帝修反浑身发抖！
　　红色宝书握在手，
　　话儿领着心儿走；
　　步步紧跟毛主席，
　　红彤彤的太阳照全球！
