Our great teacher, great leader, and the reddest sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, personally directed the formulation of the "Notice." It has been two years since its publication. Reviewing the brilliant course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over these two years, we have so much enthusiasm to sing praises to Chairman Mao's great achievements. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We wish you, the venerable leader, eternal life! Eternal life!

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, all the revolutionary people of our province, under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and with the strong support of the great People's Liberation Army, have overthrown the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in Zhejiang and exposed a group of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries who had infiltrated the party. We have shattered their "dream" of restoring capitalism in Zhejiang. From the elderly with white hair to children in their teens, everyone has seen through the ugly faces of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Zhejiang and harbors deep hatred for them. The more we hate the Chinese Khrushchev, the more we love our great leader Chairman Mao, and the more we must study Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

In the past, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Zhejiang did not allow us to study Chairman Mao's books, blocked Chairman Mao's instructions at every level, and deliberately distorted them. This is their heinous crime. Now, we have overthrown these class enemies and seized power from their hands. Therefore, Mao Zedong Thought has been unprecedentedly popularized. The poor and lower-middle peasants in the Jinhua region say: "The capitalist roaders are bad in every way, but the worst is that they oppose us from studying Chairman Mao's works. The revolutionary committees are good in every way, but the best is that they organize us to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in practice."

The revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses of the whole province, with boundless love, admiration, faith, and loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao, have, under the strong help of the People's Liberation Army, launched a new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in practice. The Provincial Revolutionary Committee sent Chairman Mao's brilliant works to the poor and lower-middle peasants of the whole province, which was warmly welcomed by the broad masses. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have blossomed everywhere, creating a lively scene of "factories, mines, and communes setting up classes, ten thousand households and a thousand villages in red, revolutionary books in every home, and red songs sung by everyone." The study classes are both battlefields for criticizing and repudiating revisionism and reactionary thoughts and classrooms for studying and praising Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's great achievements. Through study, the broad revolutionary masses are even more loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The ship sails with the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.

The broad masses have grasped Mao Zedong Thought, showing unparalleled power. Their eyes are bright, and their direction is clear, launching relentless attacks on the class enemies. The broad revolutionary masses use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, firmly grasp class struggle, and deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism. Now, the whole province is launching a new high tide of revolutionary criticism with great momentum. The revolutionary masses use the red arrows of Mao Zedong Thought to shoot at the black targets of the Chinese Khrushchev, hitting the bullseye every time, and the revolutionary flames burn more fiercely.

The unprecedented popularization of Mao Zedong Thought has powerfully promoted the thought revolution of the people, consolidated and developed the great alliance of the revolution and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Most of the regions in the province have already achieved the great alliance of the revolutionary masses, and the revolutionary committees have been established like bamboo shoots after a rain. Many regions have already achieved a sea of red. The spiritual face of the broad masses has been renewed, and their enthusiasm for production has reached an unprecedented height. The broad revolutionary cadres are striving to criticize and repudiate revisionism and reactionary thoughts, establishing the thought of "completely, thoroughly" serving the people. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants are striving to break private interests and establish public interests, establishing the thought of "farming for the revolution" and "working for the collective." Good deeds of selflessness and love for the collective have emerged in large numbers. Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" has been further implemented. The revolutionary and production situation in the whole province is excellent and getting better and better.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the condition of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the reactionary Kuomintang led by the broad revolutionary masses of the people, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's brilliant and great instruction has pointed out the direction for us, enabling us to concentrate our forces and targets, directing the spearhead of the struggle against our class enemies. Zhejiang is the old nest of the people's enemy Chiang Kai-shek, where many remnants of the reactionary Kuomintang are hiding. Now, a small handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are still unwilling to admit defeat. As Chairman Mao teaches us: "They will try to restore capitalism in China every day and every hour." Especially since Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has achieved victory after victory, the class enemies cannot escape their doom of thorough annihilation, and they will become more desperate and struggle to the death.

We, the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat, have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, our minds are clear, and we have seen through the evil plots of the class enemies. We are determined, under the support of the People's Liberation Army, to thoroughly smash the rightist reversal wind blown by a small handful of class enemies, deeply criticize rightist opportunism, rightist splitism, and rightist capitulationism, and take the initiative to attack the class enemies. This struggle has already achieved great victories. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, always follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. We must launch a larger-scale mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in practice, continue to run Mao Zedong Thought study classes well, and consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination by system, industry, and class. We must unite the majority of cadres and masses, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform of each unit, grasp revolution to promote production, work, and preparedness, and do a better job in all aspects of work.

    热烈欢呼毛泽东思想空前大普及
    浙江省革命委员会副主任　华银凤
    我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席亲自主持制定的《通知》，发表两周年了。回顾这两年来无产阶级文化大革命的光辉历程，我们心中有多少热情歌颂毛主席丰功伟绩的话要讲。毛主席啊，毛主席！我们千遍万遍地敬祝您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    在这史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们全省革命人民在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，在伟大的中国人民解放军的大力支持下，打倒了中国赫鲁晓夫在浙江的代理人，揪出了一批混入党内的叛徒、特务、反革命分子，打破了他们在浙江复辟资本主义的“美梦”。从白发苍苍的老人，到十几岁的小孩，都看清了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在浙江的代理人的丑恶面目，对他们无比仇恨。我们对中国赫鲁晓夫越恨，就越对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，就越要更好地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。
    过去，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在浙江的代理人，不让我们读毛主席的书，把毛主席的指示层层封锁，肆意歪曲。这是他们特大的罪状。现在，我们已经把这些阶级敌人打倒，把大权从他们手中夺回来了。因此，毛泽东思想空前大普及。我们金华地区的贫下中农说：“走资派千坏万坏，反对我们学习毛主席著作是最大的坏。革命委员会千好万好，组织我们活学活用毛泽东思想是最大的好。”
    全省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限崇拜、无限信仰、无限忠诚的心情，在人民解放军的大力帮助下，掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的新高潮。省革命委员会向全省贫下中农赠送毛主席光辉著作，受到广大群众的热烈欢迎。各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班遍地开花，出现了“厂矿、社队遍地办，万户千村红烂熳，革命宝书家家读，红色歌曲人人唱”的生动局面。学习班既是斗私批修的战场，又是大学毛泽东思想，大颂毛主席丰功伟绩的课堂。通过学习，广大革命群众更加忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。
    广大群众掌握了毛泽东思想，显示出无比的威力。他们眼睛亮，方向明，向阶级敌人不断地发起猛烈进攻。广大革命群众用毛泽东思想为武器，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命的大批判。现在，全省正掀起一个声势浩大的革命大批判新高潮。革命群众用毛泽东思想的红箭，射中国赫鲁晓夫的黑靶，箭箭射中靶心，革命烈火越烧越旺。
    毛泽东思想大普及，有力地促进了人的思想革命化，巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。全省绝大部分地区已经实现无产阶级革命派大联合，革命委员会象雨后春笋般建立起来。不少地区已经实现了一片红。广大群众的精神面貌焕然一新，生产积极性空前高涨。广大革命干部努力斗私批修，树立“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的思想。广大贫下中农努力破私立公，树立“为革命种田”、“为集体劳动”的思想。一心为公、热爱集体的好人好事大量涌现出来。毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，进一步得到贯彻。全省革命和生产形势一片大好，越来越好。
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席这个英明伟大的指示，给我们指明了方向，使我们更能集中力量，集中目标，把斗争矛头对准我们的阶级敌人。我们浙江是人民公敌蒋介石的老窝，潜伏了不少国民党反动派的残渣余孽。现在，一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派以及没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，还不甘心失败，正如毛主席教导我们的：“他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。”特别是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线取得了节节胜利，阶级敌人逃不脱彻底灭亡的命运，他们更要狗急跳墙，垂死挣扎。
    我们广大无产阶级革命派，学习了毛主席的最新指示，心明眼亮，识破了阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋，决心在人民解放军的支持下，彻底粉碎一小撮阶级敌人刮起的右倾翻案妖风，深入批判右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，向阶级敌人主动进攻。这场斗争已经取得了很大胜利。我们更要听毛主席的话，永远紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向。我们要掀起更大规模的活学活用毛泽东思想的群众性的热潮，继续大力办好毛泽东思想学习班，大力巩固和发展按系统、按行业、按班级的革命大联合和革命的三结合，团结干部和群众的大多数，搞好各单位的斗批改，要抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备，把各方面的工作做得更好。
