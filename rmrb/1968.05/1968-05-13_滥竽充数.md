	Filling the Ranks with Unfit Soldiers
	Xiaowen

	Harold Krents, a blind student at Harvard Law School in Boston, USA, was recently stripped of his student deferment by the American draft authorities and classified as 1-A, eligible for immediate conscription. The United Press International reported this incident as a joke, but in reality, it reflects the desperate situation of the U.S. imperialists in their search for cannon fodder for the Vietnam War.

	The U.S. imperialists have fully exposed their fatal weakness of insufficient manpower in the Vietnam War. To meet the needs of expanding the war and to make up for heavy casualties, the Johnson administration has since 1965 devised various methods to expand the pool of recruits. It has abolished previous exemptions and deferments, including married men without children, minors under 18, delinquent youth, professional athletes, and college students, all of whom are now subject to the draft. It has also implemented measures such as extending the service terms of active-duty personnel, recalling veterans, and activating reservists. It has even raised the maximum draft age from 26 to 35. Even this is not enough; it has resorted to lowering recruitment standards to accept a large number of physically and mentally unfit individuals. According to the United Press International, from July 1965 to June 1967, over 40,000 such individuals were drafted but had to be discharged from the military due to their inability to serve. Clearly, cases like Krents being classified as a fit recruit are not isolated incidents.

	The U.S. imperialist invasion forces are originally composed of soldiers lacking fighting spirit. Due to heavy casualties and dwindling manpower in the Vietnam War, they are forced to conscript "weaklings" to fill the ranks. This will inevitably further weaken the combat effectiveness of the U.S. invasion forces, making them even more vulnerable on the battlefield, and increasing casualties. Consequently, the U.S. imperialists' manpower shortage will become even more severe. This vicious cycle will inevitably hasten the U.S. imperialists' complete defeat in the Vietnam War, which is something that the Johnson clique cannot do anything about.

    滥竽充数
    晓文
    美国波士顿城哈佛法科学校的学生哈罗德·克伦茨，生下来就是一个瞎子。但是，美国征兵当局最近竟然取消了他的学生缓役资格，把他列为1—A级的可以立即被征入伍的壮丁。美国合众国际社是把这件事情作为一个笑谈来报道的，但是，实际上它却反映了美帝国主义在搜罗侵越战争炮灰的问题上饥不择食的窘态。
    美帝国主义在侵越战争中，彻底暴露了兵力不足的致命弱点。为了应付扩大侵越战争的需要和补充惨重的伤亡，约翰逊政府从一九六五年以来，想尽了各种办法，来扩大兵源。它取消了过去的一些免役、缓役的规定，把已婚而无子女的青年、不满十八岁的青少年、犯罪的青年、职业运动员、大学生等通通列为征兵的对象。它又采取了延长现役人员服役期限、征召退伍士兵入伍、征召后备役军人服现役，把应征入伍的最高年龄从二十六岁提到三十五岁等措施。这样还不够，它还用降低入伍标准的办法，接收大批体力和智力低下的人入伍。据合众国际社报道，从一九六五年七月到一九六七年六月两年之内，这种人被征入伍以后由于实在不行而不得不从军队中开除出去的，就达四万多人。可见，象克伦茨这样的残废人被当作合格的壮丁，绝不是个别的例子。
    美帝国主义的侵略军队本来就是些士无斗志的少爷兵。由于在侵越战争中伤亡惨重和兵源枯竭，它不得不强拉一些“弱丁”来滥竽充数。这样一来，美国侵略军的战斗力就必然更加减弱，因而在战场上必然更加不堪一击，伤亡也就必然要更加激增，结果美帝国主义兵源枯竭的情况也就必然更加严重。这种恶性循环，必将使美帝国主义在侵越战争中加速走向彻底的失败，而这是约翰逊之流无可奈何的。
