SANTIAGO, May 28 (New China News Agency) — The strike by students of the University of Chile in the capital Santiago to protest the reactionary measures taken by school authorities to persecute progressive teachers has spread to Valparaiso, the main port city of Chile. Students of the Normal School there have also gone on strike and occupied the school buildings.

The number of university students participating in the strike has now reached 20,000. In addition to the students of the Faculty of Philosophy and Education who initiated the strike, students from the faculties of Fine Arts, Veterinary Medicine, Law, Engineering, and other faculties have also joined the strike.

Students participating in the strike have taken various forms of resistance. They held mass meetings, banned reactionary teachers from entering the classroom, occupied school buildings, and demanded the appointment of new university leaders supported by the students. On the evening of the 24th, students of the Faculty of Journalism at the University of Chile occupied the university's television broadcasting station. This action was supported by the workers of the television station.

The students participating in the struggle have stated that they will drive the reactionary school authorities out of the university because the reactionary school authorities want to train students to be lackeys of imperialism.

Meanwhile, 6,000 workers at the Huachipato Steel Plant in Chile went on strike on the 25th, demanding a wage increase. On the same day, 1,200 workers in the paper industry also went on strike.

According to the New China News Agency, hundreds of students at the University of Brussels in Belgium occupied the school's main lecture hall on the 17th. They shouted revolutionary slogans and demanded educational reform. In an appeal to the people, they linked their actions with the demonstrations by Paris students.

    智利学生反迫害斗争浪潮迭起
    两万多大学生参加罢课，学生占领校舍禁止反动教师任教
    新华社二十八日讯　圣地亚哥消息：智利首都圣地亚哥的智利大学学生为抗议学校当局采取迫害进步教师的反动措施而举行的罢课斗争，已经扩大到智利主要港口瓦尔帕来索城。当地的师范学院学生也宣布罢课，并占领了校舍。
    目前参加罢课斗争的大学生人数已达到两万人。除原先发起罢课的智利大学哲学教育学院学生以外，参加罢课的还有美术、兽医、法律、工程和其他学院学生。
    参加罢课斗争的学生采取了各种形式的反抗行动，他们召开群众大会；禁止反动教师进入课堂；占领学校的校舍；要求任命受到学生支持的新的大学领导。二十四日晚，智利大学新闻学院的学生占领了这个大学的电视广播台，这次行动得到了电视台工人们的支持。
    参加斗争的学生表示，要把反动学校当局从大学清除出去，因为反动学校当局要把学生们培养成为帝国主义的走狗。
    同时，智利瓦奇帕托钢铁工厂的六千名工人二十五日宣布罢工，要求提高工资。造纸工业的一千二百名工人也在同一天开始罢工。
    据新华社讯　比利时布鲁塞尔大学的数百名学生十七日占领了学校的大讲堂。他们高呼革命口号，要求实行教育改革。在一份给人民的呼吁书中，他们把他们的行动同巴黎学生的示威行动联系在一起。
