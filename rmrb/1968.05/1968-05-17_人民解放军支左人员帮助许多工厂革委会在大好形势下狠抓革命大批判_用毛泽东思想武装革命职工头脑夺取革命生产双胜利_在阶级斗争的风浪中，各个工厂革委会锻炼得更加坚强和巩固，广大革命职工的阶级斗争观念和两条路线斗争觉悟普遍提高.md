PLA support-leftist personnel have helped many factory revolutionary committees seize the good situation to intensify revolutionary criticism. By arming revolutionary workers with Mao Zedong Thought, they have achieved double victories in revolution and production. In the storm of class struggle, each factory's revolutionary committee has been tempered to become stronger and more consolidated. The class struggle consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle of the broad revolutionary workers have generally been raised.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 16th, PLA support-leftist personnel have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." They have helped the revolutionary workers in the factories they are stationed in to intensify class struggle, carry out deep and sustained revolutionary criticism, raise the class struggle consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle of the broad revolutionary workers, and make the revolution roar and production continuously rise.

	Anshan Iron and Steel Company's First Steel Plant Remembers Class Struggle in Good Situation

In the good situation, some workers in Anshan Iron and Steel Company's First Steel Plant had a weakened class struggle consciousness. In pre-shift meetings, there was less talk about class struggle and the Cultural Revolution, and more talk about production. The stationed PLA support-leftist personnel paid great attention to this ideological trend. They believed that in the new situation where the Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victory, whether or not to guide the broad revolutionary workers to always remember class struggle and continue to launch a proactive attack on the class enemy is a key issue related to whether the Cultural Revolution can be carried out to the end and the good situation can be consolidated and developed. They must arm the workers' minds with Mao Zedong Thought. The better the production situation, the more one must always remember class struggle. Therefore, they, together with the members of the revolutionary committee, went deep into the workshops and teams, organized revolutionary workers to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes in the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its leadership and the broad revolutionary people on the one hand and the Kuomintang reactionaries on the other, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." They guided everyone to use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, to expose the class enemy's sabotage activities, and to analyze the new situation of class struggle. Many workers deeply felt that no matter how much you talk, it is better to lay out the facts and see for yourself. This time we have seen clearly that the revolutionary and production situation is good, the working class is happy, but the class enemy is resentful. They are not willing to admit defeat. If we forget class struggle, all the victories we have achieved will be in danger of being lost. We must carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat and do class struggle year after year, month after month, day after day, and carry out revolutionary criticism year after year, month after month, day after day.

On the basis of universally raising awareness, the support-leftist personnel and members of the revolutionary committee helped the No. 8 open-hearth furnace to summarize the experience of always remembering class struggle in the good production situation and carrying out deep and sustained revolutionary criticism. The No. 8 open-hearth furnace has always put emphasis on intensifying class struggle, continuously creating new records for rapid steelmaking, and being awarded a collective second-class merit. In this situation, they still carried out deep and sustained revolutionary criticism, launched a proactive attack on the class enemy, and used class struggle to drive production struggle, making the workshop's revolution and production present a new situation. The revolutionary committee held an on-site meeting to promote the experience of the No. 8 open-hearth furnace throughout the factory, greatly raising the class struggle consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle of the revolutionary workers throughout the factory, and increasing revolutionary enthusiasm. Since the second quarter, production has developed even more greatly compared to the first quarter.

	First Automobile Works Carriage Factory Intensifies Class Struggle and Achieves Continuous Victories Against the Enemy

As soon as the revolutionary committee of the First Automobile Works Carriage Factory was established, the stationed PLA support-leftist personnel actively helped the members of the revolutionary committee to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and intensify class struggle. They first organized all the workers in the factory to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, and used the factory's class struggle facts as a living textbook to carry out class education in response to the workers' active thoughts. They went deep into the grassroots level, analyzed the enemy situation with the masses, and launched a proactive attack on the class enemy, exposing a class enemy who had been hidden for a long time.

Exposing one bad person raised the class struggle consciousness once. Everyone hated the class enemy even more, and their fighting will was even stronger. Therefore, they advanced victoriously, and in a few days, they exposed another historical counter-revolutionary. This guy's counter-revolutionary activities once again gave the workers a living class struggle education from the opposite side. The broad masses said: In the complex and fierce class struggle, the class enemies who have been overthrown are not willing to die. They will still try every means to struggle with us. Therefore, we must insist on carrying out revolutionary criticism, constantly strengthen the class struggle consciousness, constantly raise the awareness of the two-line struggle, and launch an unremitting attack on the class enemy.

	Beijing First Sanitation Vehicle Factory Carries Out Deep and Sustained Revolutionary Criticism

The PLA support-leftist personnel stationed in Beijing First Sanitation Vehicle Factory helped the factory's revolutionary committee use the factory's class struggle as a living textbook to mobilize and organize the revolutionary masses throughout the factory to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize Khrushchev's "class struggle extinguishment" theory, making the flames of revolutionary criticism burn more fiercely. While carrying out revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary workers throughout the factory, under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, exposed a handful of bad people who attempted to overthrow the revolutionary committee.

During the struggle against a handful of class enemies, the support-leftist personnel found that some revolutionary masses only paid attention to exposing these bad guys' sabotage activities and did not pay attention to linking them with Khrushchev for criticism. They immediately, together with the revolutionary masses, deeply studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the fundamental contradiction that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution wants to solve, which is the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, two classes, two roads, and two lines. They helped everyone to realize that Khrushchev is the biggest capitalist roader within the party, the representative of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. To carry out the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in this unit to the end, we must carry out the struggle to criticize the handful of biggest capitalist roaders within the party led by Khrushchev to the end. Old worker Wang Yucun, in criticizing the reactionary capitalist's sabotage activities, through a comparison of past and present, recalled bitterness and sweetness, mercilessly exposed this guy's various crimes, and used his personal feelings to fiercely criticize Khrushchev's "class struggle extinguishment" theory, "exploitation is meritorious," "capitalists have great merits and small sins," and other fallacies, criticizing Khrushchev's revisionist counter-revolutionary crimes to the point of no escape. The revolutionary workers were excited and said: "We must grasp the black vine and dig up the black root, wipe them out, and eliminate their poison."

Revolutionary criticism promoted the thought revolutionization of people, and the factory's revolution and production presented a hot and lively revolutionary scene.

	Shuanhua Pneumatic Tool Factory Achieves Double Victories in Revolution and Production

Shuanhua Pneumatic Tool Factory mainly produces down-the-hole drills and cars for mines. Due to the sabotage and disruption by class enemies, the supply of raw materials was insufficient, affecting the completion of production tasks. In this situation, the stationed PLA support-leftist personnel and members of the revolutionary committee went to the masses, and together with the broad revolutionary masses, discussed production issues, exposed the class enemies' evil plot to sabotage the revolution and promote production. They turned the production discussion meeting into a criticism meeting to launch a fierce attack on the class enemy. They carried out class education and situation education among the workers, arousing the broad revolutionary workers' boundless hatred for the class enemy, and raising the class struggle consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle of the revolutionary workers.

The revolutionary workers throughout the factory carried forward the spirit of daring to think and dare to do, hard work, self-reliance, and regarded overcoming difficulties and completing tasks as the most powerful counterattack on the class enemy. The forging group comrades repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings, combined with production issues, repeatedly researched, and continuously improved. The quality and quantity gradually increased. In the first quarter, the total industrial output value increased by 82% compared to the same period last year, and the cost decreased by 22.18% compared to the same period last year, creating the highest production record since the factory was established.

    用毛泽东思想武装革命职工头脑夺取革命生产双胜利
    在阶级斗争的风浪中，各个工厂革委会锻炼得更加坚强和巩固，广大革命职工的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟普遍提高
    据新华社十六日讯　解放军支左人员坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，帮助所在厂广大革命职工狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，提高了广大革命职工的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟，革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产不断上升。
          鞍钢第一炼钢厂在大好形
    势下念念不忘阶级斗争
    在大好形势下，鞍山钢铁公司第一炼钢厂部分职工阶级斗争观念有些淡薄了。工前碰头会上，讲阶级斗争、文化大革命的少了，讲生产的多了。驻厂解放军支左人员十分重视这种思想苗头。他们认为：在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的新形势下，能不能引导广大革命职工念念不忘阶级斗争，继续向阶级敌人发起主动进攻，这是关系到能不能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底、巩固和发展大好形势的关键问题，一定要用毛泽东思想武装工人的头脑，生产形势越好，越要念念不忘阶级斗争。于是，他们和革委会成员一起深入到车间、班组，组织革命职工反复学习毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”引导大家以毛主席最新指示为武器，大摆本厂阶级斗争现实，大揭阶级敌人的破坏活动，分析阶级斗争新形势。很多工人深有感触地说：说一千道一万，不如摆开事实看一看，这回我们可看清了，革命生产形势大好，工人阶级喜在眉梢，阶级敌人却恨在心头，他们绝不甘心失败。我们如果忘记了阶级斗争，所取得的一切胜利就有付之东流的危险。我们一定要发扬无产阶级彻底革命精神，做到阶级斗争年年讲，月月讲，天天讲，革命大批判年年搞，月月搞，天天搞。
    在普遍提高认识的基础上，支左人员和革委会成员一起帮助八号平炉总结了在生产大好形势下念念不忘阶级斗争、深入持久开展革命大批判的经验。八号平炉始终把狠抓阶级斗争放在第一位，连续创造了快速炼钢最新纪录，荣立集体二等功。在这种情况下，他们仍深入持久开展革命大批判，主动向阶级敌人进攻，以阶级斗争带动生产斗争，使车间革命、生产出现了更新的局面。革委会召开了现场会，在全厂推广了八号平炉的经验，大大提高了全厂革命职工的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟，革命干劲倍增，第二季度以来生产又比第一季度有了更大的发展。
            长春第一汽车制造厂车厢
    厂狠抓阶级斗争，连续取得对
      敌斗争的胜利
    长春第一汽车制造厂车厢厂革命委员会一成立，驻厂解放军支左人员就积极帮助革委会成员紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓阶级斗争。他们首先组织全厂职工反复学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，并且以本单位阶级斗争事实为活教材，针对群众的活思想进行阶级教育。他们深入基层，和群众一起分析敌情，主动向阶级敌人发起进攻，把一个长期荫蔽下来的阶级敌人揪了出来。
    揪出一个坏人，提高了一次阶级斗争观念。大家对阶级敌人更加仇恨了，战斗意志更加旺盛了。于是，乘胜前进，不几天功夫，又揪出了一个历史反革命分子。这个家伙的反革命活动，又一次从反面给了工人群众以活生生的阶级斗争教育。广大群众说：在复杂激烈的阶级斗争中，被打倒的阶级敌人，是不甘心死亡的，他们还要千方百计同我们作斗争。因此，我们必须坚持开展革命大批判，不断增强阶级斗争观念，不断提高两条路线斗争觉悟，不停顿地向阶级敌人发动进攻。
          北京第一清洁车辆厂深入
      持久开展革命大批判
    驻北京第一清洁车辆厂的人民解放军北京部队空军某部支左人员，帮助这个厂革委会利用厂内阶级斗争的活教材，发动和组织全厂革命群众以毛泽东思想为武器，大批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，使革命大批判的熊熊烈火越烧越旺。在开展革命大批判的同时，全厂革命职工擦亮了眼睛，在革委会的率领下，揪出了妄图颠覆革命委员会的一小撮坏人。
    在与一小撮阶级敌人进行斗争的时候，部队支左人员发现有些革命群众只注意揭发这些坏家伙的破坏活动，而不注意把他们同中国赫鲁晓夫联系起来进行批判，又及时同革命群众一起，深入学习毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命所要解决的根本矛盾，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的矛盾的教导，帮助大家认识到中国赫鲁晓夫是党内最大的走资派，是资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的总代表，要把本单位的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争进行到底，就必须把批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮最大的走资派的斗争进行到底。老工人王玉泉在批判反动资本家的破坏活动时，通过今昔对比，忆苦思甜，无情地揭发了这个家伙的种种罪行，并用自己的亲身感受狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“剥削有功”、“资本家功大罪小”等谬论，把中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义罪行批了个体无完肤。革命职工群情激奋地说：“我们就是要揪住黑藤挖黑根，把他们一窝端掉，并肃清他们的流毒。”
    革命大批判，促进了人的思想革命化，这个厂革命、生产出现了热气腾腾的革命景象。
          宣化风动工具厂取得革命
      生产双胜利
    宣化风动工具厂，主要是生产为矿山服务的潜孔钻机和台车。由于阶级敌人的破坏和捣乱，原材料供应不足，影响了生产任务的完成。在这种情况下，驻厂解放军支左人员和革委会成员到群众中去，和广大革命群众一起，联系生产上的问题，揭露了阶级敌人妄图破坏抓革命促生产的罪恶阴谋。他们把生产讨论会，变成了向阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻的批判会。在职工中大力开展阶级教育和形势教育，激发了广大革命职工对阶级敌人的无比仇恨，提高了革命职工的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    全厂革命职工发扬了敢想敢干，艰苦奋斗，自力更生的革命精神，把克服困难完成任务看作是对阶级敌人最有力的回击。锻工组的同志又一遍遍地学习毛主席的伟大教导，结合生产上的问题，反复研究，不断改进，质量、数量逐步上升。第一季度，工业总产值比去年同期提高百分之八十二，成本比去年同期降低百分之二十二点一八，创造了建厂以来的最高生产纪录。
