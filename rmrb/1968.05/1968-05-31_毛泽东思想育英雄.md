The flames of the Cultural Revolution burn brightly,
Mao Zedong Thought nurtures heroes.
The doors are closed, but your brilliant achievements shine like the sun and moon,
Martyr, you stand tall and firm like a pine tree on Kunlun.

Your arms dance on Kunlun, your voice soars over Nanling,
The Yangtze roars, the South China Sea surges,
Every mountain and river looks up to you,
People from all over the country sing your praises.

You, thinking of Chairman Mao in everything,
Sacrificing yourself many times to save your comrades;
You, obeying Chairman Mao in everything,
Dispelling the fog and cutting down the demonic winds;
You, following Chairman Mao in everything,
Twenty years of revolution, steadfast and loyal;
You, living for Chairman Mao in everything,
Calm and composed even in the face of fire and knives.

Look, to save a comrade, you rush towards the blast,
You, unperturbed, without a trace of fear,
With your life, you defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line,
With your blood, you write the greatest "loyalty"!

Martyr, you were born for the revolution,
Martyr, your death is heavier than Mount Tai.
You are like a torch burning in our hearts,
You are like a red flag flying above us.

Learn from you, be loyal to the people and the Party,
Learn from you, stand firm and hold high the red banner,
Learn from you, thoroughly transform your worldview,
Learn from you, be forever revolutionary and absolutely loyal!

Look, millions of soldiers charge like warhorses,
Holding the precious book, climbing the peak of "loyalty."
Ah, not reaching the Great Wall is not a hero,
Following Chairman Mao, we vow to make the world red.

    毛泽东思想育英雄
    解放军战士　钟永华
    文化大革命烈火熊，
    毛泽东思想育英雄，
    门合呵，光辉业绩照日月，
    烈士呵，顶天立地一劲松。
    昆仑舞臂，南岭高歌，
    长江澎湃，南海奔腾，
    山山水水翘首望呵，
    五湖四海把你颂。
    你，“一切想着毛主席”，
    多次舍己救弟兄；
    你，“一切服从毛主席”，
    驱散迷雾斩妖风；
    你，“一切紧跟毛主席”，
    二十年革命一贯忠；
    你，“一切为着毛主席”，
    刀山火海仍从容。
    看，为救同志，扑向炸点，
    你，面不改色，毫不心惊，
    用生命去捍卫毛主席革命路线，
    用鲜血写下了最大的“忠”！
    门合呵，你生为革命而生，
    烈士呵，你死比泰山还重。
    你象一把火炬燃烧在我们心里，
    你象一面红旗飘扬在我们上空。
    学习你，忠于人民忠于党，
    学习你，立场坚定旗帜红，
    学习你，彻底改造世界观，
    学习你，永远革命绝对忠！
    看，千万支大军象战马驰骋，
    手捧宝书，攀登“忠”的高峰。
    呵，不到长城非好汉，
    跟着毛主席，誓叫世界一片红。
