Chairman Mao's radiant instructions illuminate the path to victory for Li Jia Zhai.
Move Mountains Like Yu Gong, Transform China

Over the past decade, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have smashed the various plots and sabotage activities of the class enemy, bravely forging ahead amidst the storms of class struggle. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, seized the revolution, and vigorously promoted production, achieving new and tremendous successes.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan: "Move mountains like Yu Gong, transform China; Li Jia Zhai is a good example." This radiant instruction from the great leader Chairman Mao is like a lighthouse with beams of light, illuminating the path to victory for the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Li Jia Zhai Commune, Juxian County, Shandong Province. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the heroic people of Li Jia Zhai have continued to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, achieving tremendous successes in the struggle to seize the revolution and promote production.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Li Jia Zhai Commune have, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, seized the revolution, and vigorously promoted production. Everywhere, a great and stirring revolutionary scene and a hot and bustling production scene are presented. Now, from production brigades to production teams and various specialized teams, from households to fields, classes studying Chairman Mao Zedong Thought are springing up and flourishing. Everywhere are classrooms for studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong Thought in practice, and battlefields for criticizing China's Khrushchev and his agents. Villages and fields are adorned with the eight golden characters: "Move mountains like Yu Gong, transform China." The poor and lower-middle peasants say: "Chairman Mao's instruction shines with golden light, every word and sentence is etched in our hearts; we have resolved to move mountains like Yu Gong, and we will be heroes in revolution and production." They follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, and in the past two years, they have repaired and built 680 mu of terraced fields and riverbank land, planted 180 mu of riverbank forests, planted nearly 130,000 trees of various kinds, 55,000 cotton and locust trees, and built a small reservoir. Today's Li Jia Zhai presents a new look with green mountains and lush hills, crisscrossing gullies, a land like a brocade, and terraced fields covering the hills. Last year, the per-unit-area yield of grain in this commune reached 707 jin, an increase of 45% over 1957, and the income from various sideline productions increased by 50%. Last year, 260,000 jin of grain were sold to the state, exceeding the state plan by 40,000 jin. 240,000 jin of peanuts were sold to the state, completing the state procurement task by 100%.

Li Jia Zhai has been advancing amidst the storms of class struggle. The struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines has never ceased in Li Jia Zhai. In 1957, Chairman Mao's great instruction to Li Jia Zhai inspired the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Li Jia Zhai Commune to bravely advance in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. However, China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shandong, as well as the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, feared and hated Chairman Mao's instruction to the core. They used every means to try to cut down the red flag of Li Jia Zhai. From 1958 to 1960, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party maliciously said that "Li Jia Zhai 'cannot produce new plays,' has no future," and spread the evil wind of "moving the red flag." During the period when our national economy encountered temporary difficulties due to the sabotage by the Khrushchev revisionist clique in the Soviet Union and three consecutive years of natural disasters, they spread the black wind of "three autonomies and one contract." The revolutionary people of Li Jia Zhai, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, saw through the class enemy's plots and fought back against them head-on, striking a decisive blow against their evil plots to restore capitalism and further consolidating and developing the collective economy. The handful of capitalist roaders within the party, failing in one scheme, devised another. They used the pretext of "caring for" Li Jia Zhai to spread the counter-revolutionary economism witchcraft, using money and fertilizer to "cultivate" this model, attempting to corrupt the poor and lower-middle peasants' revolutionary will of self-reliance and striving for progress. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Li Jia Zhai fought back against them resolutely. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Li Jia Zhai rebelled against the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and launched a great exposure and criticism of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, resolutely eliminating its poisonous influence. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants set up classes studying Mao Zedong Thought on the construction site of the Leizhai River Reservoir, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's instruction of "Move mountains like Yu Gong, transform China" and the "Old Three Articles." They reviewed the decade-long battle course of fighting against heaven and earth, opening mountains and cutting through ridges under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and discussed the topic of "whether to be like Yu Gong or like the wise fool; whether to be self-reliant or to beg from the state." Through the discussion, they criticized the handful of capitalist roaders within the party's promotion of "material incentives," "work points as the commander," and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods, further establishing the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress. In the construction, they opened mountains themselves when there were no stones, made tools themselves when there were no tools, raised funds themselves when there was no money, and did not beg for a single cent from the state. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "making a firm decision, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," fearing neither the cold nor the frost, insisting on winter construction, and ensuring the progress of the project.

In the struggle to seize the revolution and promote production, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Li Jia Zhai used the "Old Three Articles" as a weapon, broke down private interests and established public interests, igniting a revolution in the depths of their souls, and further establishing the thought of farming for the revolution.

The people of Li Jia Zhai have carried forward the spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong and the experience of self-reliance in treating mountains and water, which has attracted the attention of revolutionary masses both inside and outside the province. However, the heroic people of Li Jia Zhai are not satisfied with the achievements they have already made. They are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, remain humble and cautious, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take class struggle as the key link, learn from Dazhai, persist in criticizing and repudiating revisionism, persist in letting revolution guide production, and continue to advance bravely along the broad avenue pointed out by the great leader Chairman Mao, striving for new victories.

    毛主席的光辉批示照耀着厉家寨胜利前进的道路
    愚公移山　改造中国
    十多年来，广大贫下中农粉碎了阶级敌人的各种阴谋破坏活动，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中奋勇前进。在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大贫下中农紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓革命，猛促生产，又取得新的巨大成绩
    据新华社济南电　“愚公移山，改造中国，厉家寨是一个好例。”伟大领袖毛主席这一光辉的批示，象光芒万丈的灯塔，照耀着山东省莒南县厉家寨公社广大贫下中农胜利前进的道路。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，英雄的厉家寨人，继续发扬敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，在抓革命、促生产的斗争中，又取得了巨大的成绩。
    厉家寨公社广大贫下中农在无产阶级文化大革命中，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓革命，猛促生产，到处呈现革命轰轰烈烈，生产热气腾腾的大好局面。现在，这个公社从生产大队到生产队以至各种专业队，从家庭到田头，毛泽东思想学习班越办越多，越办越好，到处都是活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂，都是批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的战场。村里、场头，到处张贴着“愚公移山，改造中国”八个金光闪闪的大字。贫下中农说：“毛主席的批示闪金光，字字句句记心上；立下愚公移山志，革命、生产当闯将。”他们遵照毛主席的伟大教导，两年来新整修梯田、河滩地六百八十多亩，河滩造林一百八十多亩，种植各种树木近十三万株，棉槐五万五千墩，还修了一座小型水库，使今日的厉家寨出现了山苍岭翠，沟渠纵横，大地如锦绣，梯田遍山岗的崭新面貌。去年这个公社粮食的单位面积产量达到七百零七斤，比一九五七年增长百分之四十五，多种经济收入增长百分之五十。去年向国家交售粮食二十六万多斤，超过国家计划四万多斤。交售花生米二十四万多斤，超额一倍完成国家收购任务。
    厉家寨是在阶级斗争的大风大浪中不断前进的。两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，在厉家寨一直没有停息。一九五七年毛主席对厉家寨的伟大批示，鼓舞着厉家寨公社的广大贫下中农在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中奋勇前进。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在山东的代理人以及地、富、反、坏、右分子，却对毛主席的批示，怕得要死，恨得要命，他们千方百计，妄图砍掉厉家寨这面红旗。在一九五八年到一九六○年期间，党内一小撮走资派胡说什么“厉家寨‘排不出新戏’，没有发展前途”，刮起“红旗要搬家”的阴风：在我国国民经济由于苏联赫鲁晓夫叛徒集团的破坏和连续三年自然灾害，遇到暂时困难时期，他们又刮起“三自一包”的黑风。用毛泽东思想武装起来的厉家寨革命人民，识破了阶级敌人的阴谋，和他们进行了针锋相对的斗争，迎头痛击了他们复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，进一步巩固和发展了集体经济。党内一小撮走资派，一计不成，又生一计。他们以“关心”厉家寨为名，大刮反革命经济主义妖风，以金钱、化肥来“培植”这个典型，妄图腐蚀贫下中农奋发图强、自力更生的革命意志。厉家寨广大贫下中农和革命干部，又同他们进行了坚决的斗争。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，厉家寨贫下中农造了党内一小撮走资派的反，对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线展开大揭发、大批判，坚决肃清其流毒。广大贫下中农在修建寨子河水库的工地上，办起了毛泽东思想学习班，反复学习毛主席“愚公移山，改造中国”的批示和“老三篇”。他们回顾了十多年来在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，战天斗地、开山劈岭的战斗历程，以“是当愚公，还是当智叟；是自力更生，还是向国家伸手”为题，展开了讨论。通过讨论，批判了党内一小撮走资派推行的“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货，进一步树立了奋发图强、自力更生的革命精神。他们在施工中，没有石头自己开山，没有工具自己制造，没有资金自己筹集，不向国家伸手要一分钱。他们遵照毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，不怕天寒地冻，坚持冬季施工，保证了工程的进度。
    厉家寨广大贫下中农在抓革命、促生产的战斗中，以“老三篇”为武器，破私立公，在灵魂深处爆发革命，进一步树立了为革命种田的思想。
    厉家寨人民发扬愚公移山的精神，自力更生治山治水的经验，受到省内外广大革命群众的重视。但是英雄的厉家寨人并不满足于已经取得的成绩，他们决心遵照毛主席的教导，戒骄戒躁，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以阶级斗争为纲，以大寨为榜样，坚持斗私批修，坚持以革命统帅生产，沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的康庄大道，继续奋勇前进，夺取新的胜利。
