Title: Admiring the West and Reviving the Past to Seize Power Without Shedding Blood

How should we treat literary and artistic heritage? Chairman Mao taught us in his brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" that we should "critically absorb all the beneficial elements" and that "uncritical imitation and copying of the ancients and foreigners in literature and art are the most backward and harmful forms of literary and artistic dogmatism."

The Chinese Khrushchev is an incurable "reactionary" and "Western admirer." He constantly praises "watching 'Swan Lake' can boost morale" and "the artistic level of 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' is also very high," and condemns our various artistic works as "in terms of artistic level, not as good as those from the feudal era," and "the scripts are often not as good as those from the feudal period." He completely bows down to foreigners and the ancients. He not only refuses to criticize but even forbids any slight changes: "Do not change the lyrics," "Do not interfere"! "Too hasty"! "If it cannot represent modern life, then perform historical plays." Anyone who insists on reform, he will simply wave the fake foreigner's stick and curse them: "The melon is not ripe, but you want to pick it, subjectivism, self-righteousness."

It is truly remarkable. The Soviet revisionist leadership's approach to cultural heritage is to "inherit it all," giving unconditional approval, from Lomonosov to Pushkin to the writer of the anti-Soviet poetry collection "The Swan Camp," Tsvetaeva, and the writer of the anti-communist novel "Doctor Zhivago," Pasternak, all are hailed as "outstanding geniuses." It is truly a case of "respecting saints all the way to butchers and thieves, loving beautiful flowers all the way to measles germs." The result is that weeds run wild and demons dance freely.

"Thousands of miles of dikes can be breached by an ant's hole." The harm that feudal, bourgeois, and revisionist literature and art pose to our entire socialist revolutionary cause is certainly not just a matter of an "ant's hole." If we adopt a wrong attitude towards literary heritage and indiscriminately absorb everything, then it may well cause our revolutionary "thousands of miles of dikes" to collapse.

The reason why great Marxist-Leninists emphasize the need for critical inheritance and why all counter-revolutionary revisionists stubbornly oppose criticism, shouting "comprehensive absorption," lies here.

Of course, it is not "fair" to say that the Khrushchevs of China and abroad do not criticize at all. In fact, they do have some criticism and some inheritance, and it is not so "comprehensive." What they "criticize" is Marxism-Leninism, and what they inherit is feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism; what they discard is the essence, and what they absorb is the dregs. Otherwise, how could so many weeds sprout?

However, the Chinese Khrushchev does not admit this. He says he does it to "rest and make people happy," to encourage "socialist enthusiasm"; bringing in movies from all over the world is to "let us understand national life and learn." In fact, these are all lies. His real purpose is to use this "ant's hole" to open a breach, to seize power without shedding blood, to restore capitalism without firing a single shot. This is truly serving all exploiting classes and the Kuomintang reactionaries.

Those who truly cherish and correctly treat "heritage" are the proletariat, not the bourgeoisie. Only correct criticism leads to correct inheritance and to making the past serve the present. Destruction comes first, followed by construction. Without criticism of British political economy, French utopian socialism, and German classical philosophy, there would be no Marxism. Without criticism of capitalist and feudal arts, there would be no brilliant revolutionary model operas.

Comrade Lin Biao said well: "The proletariat can only seize power, maintain power, and advance our cause through criticism, struggle, and revolution." To consolidate proletarian dictatorship, we must use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to re-examine and criticize all literary and artistic heritage, absorb its essence, and discard its dregs, making the past serve the present and the West serve China.

Let the Chinese Khrushchev, with his "Western admiration" and "reactionary" illness, go to hell.

    崇洋复古是为了“兵不血刃”夺天下
    空军某部  孺子牛
    应当怎样对待文学艺术遗产？毛主席早在《讲话》这部光辉著作中就教导我们：要“批判地吸收其中一切有益的东西”，“文学艺术中对于古人和外国人的毫无批判的硬搬和模仿，乃是最没有出息的最害人的文学教条主义和艺术教条主义”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫是一个不可救药的“复古迷”、“崇洋狂”。他张口就是“看《天鹅湖》可以提高兴致”，“《巴黎圣母院》的艺术水平也很高”，闭口就是我国的各种艺术作品“在艺术水平上讲，不如封建时代的高”，“剧本也常常不如封建时期的好”，完全拜倒在洋人古人脚下。不要说批判，稍微动一动都不行：“唱词不必去改”，“不要去干涉”！“太急了”！“不能表现现代生活的，就演历史戏”。谁要坚持改革呢，他就干脆挥动假洋鬼子的文明棍骂起大街来：“瓜没熟，要求摘，主观主义，自以为是。”
    真是无独有偶。苏修领导集团对文化遗产是“全盘继承”，一概肯定，从罗蒙诺索夫到普希金到写颂扬白党诗集《天鹅营》的茨维塔耶娃、写反共小说《日瓦戈医生》的帕斯捷尔纳克，都被尊为“杰出的天才”，真可谓“从圣贤一直敬到骗子屠夫，从美人香草一直爱到麻疹病菌”，其结果是毒草泛滥，群魔乱舞。
    “千里之堤，溃于蚁穴”。封、资、修的文学艺术对于我们整个社会主义革命事业的“千里之堤”的危害来说，当然不只是一个“蚁穴”的问题。如果我们对于文学遗产采取错误的态度，毫无批判地兼收并蓄，那么，它就有可能使我们革命的“千里之堤”毁于一旦。
    伟大的马克思列宁主义者之所以强调必须批判地继承，一切反革命修正主义分子之所以顽固地反对批判，嚷嚷“兼收并蓄”，关键就在这里。
    当然，说中外的赫鲁晓夫们根本不批判是不“公道”的，实际上他们也有所批判，有所继承，并不那么“并蓄”。他们“批判”的是马克思列宁主义，继承的是封建主义、资本主义和修正主义；扬弃的是精华，吸收的是糟粕。不然，怎么出得来那么大批大批的毒草呢？
    然而，中国赫鲁晓夫是不承认这一点的。他说他是为了“能得到休息，使人高兴”，鼓励“社会主义的积极性”；把世界各国的电影搞进来是为了“让我们了解国家生活、学习”。其实，这不过是骗人的鬼话。他真实目的是为了利用这个“蚁穴”，打开个缺口，“兵不血刃”夺天下，不费一枪一弹复辟资本主义。这是地地道道为一切剥削阶级、为国民党反动派服务的。
    真正爱护和正确对待“遗产”的是无产阶级而不是资产阶级。只有正确的批判，才有正确的继承，才能做到古为今用。破字当头，立在其中。没有对英国政治经济学、法国空想社会主义、德国古典哲学的批判，就没有马克思主义。没有对资本主义、封建主义文艺的批判，就没有光辉灿烂的革命的样板戏。
    林副主席说得好：“无产阶级，只有经过批判、斗争和革命，才能夺取政权，保持政权，推动我们的事业前进。”为了巩固无产阶级专政，我们必须运用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，重新检验、批判一切文学艺术遗产，吸收其精华，剔除其糟粕，古为今用，洋为中用。
    让中国赫鲁晓夫带着他的“崇洋”“复古”症，一同见鬼去吧。
