In Britain, Spain, Belgium, and other capitalist countries in Europe, student movements are also continuously developing. On May 14, students at the University of Essex in Britain occupied the school buildings and began a sit-in protest on the evening of the 16th, opposing the school administration's unjust treatment of students. British students are also actively participating in the struggle against Wilson's government's domestic and foreign policies and against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam.

Under Franco's rule in Spain, the student movement is becoming increasingly intense. The slogans raised by students have evolved from demanding the establishment of student unions and opposing unreasonable school regulations to "Down with Franco" and opposing the fascist dictatorship, clearly taking on a political nature. Madrid University, which accounts for half of Spain's university students, is the center of the student movement. Students at this university frequently go on strike and demonstrate, fighting against the police sent to suppress them. In March of this year, students held large-scale demonstrations against Franco, occupying several buildings on campus, forcing the Franco regime to close the entire university for forty days. The Spanish student struggle is gradually merging with the workers' struggle. In the days leading up to and following May 1, students in Madrid and other cities participated extensively in the nationwide "struggle day" organized by underground trade unions, fighting alongside workers in the streets of Madrid and other cities against the police. The students' struggle also received strong support from Spanish workers.

The struggle at the University of Louvain in Belgium, which began a few months ago, reflects the further development of the student movement in Belgium. The students' struggle started with a language issue, but it quickly evolved into political slogans directed against the Belgian government. The students' struggle directly triggered a crisis in the Belgian government.

Even in the relatively quiet Nordic countries and under fascist rule in Portugal, students are taking action. Students in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark are actively participating in the struggle against U.S. aggression in Vietnam, particularly in Sweden, where these struggles have reached unprecedented scales.

    西欧其他国家学生斗争迅速发展
    在英国、西班牙、比利时等欧洲其他资本主义国家，学生运动也在不断发展。英国艾塞克斯大学的学生五月十四日占领了学校的大楼，并且在十六日晚上开始了静坐示威，反对学校当局无理处分学生。英国学生也在纷纷参加反对威尔逊政府的内外政策、反对美帝侵略越南的斗争。
    在佛朗哥统治下的西班牙，学生运动越来越高涨。学生提出的口号，已经从要求成立学生会、反对不合理的校规，发展到“打倒佛朗哥”、反对法西斯独裁政权等具有明显的政治性质的口号。占西班牙大学生半数的马德里大学是学生运动的中心。这个大学的学生经常举行罢课、示威，同前去镇压的警察进行斗争。今年三月，学生又举行大规模的反对佛朗哥的示威，占领了学校的一些大楼，迫使佛朗哥政权把整个大学关闭了四十天。西班牙学生斗争也正在逐步同工人的斗争相汇合。今年“五一”节前后，马德里和其他一些城市的学生就广泛地参加了地下工会组织发起的全国性“斗争日”，同工人并肩在马德里等地大街上和警察搏斗。学生的斗争也得到西班牙工人的有力支持。
    比利时卢万大学学生几个月前开展的斗争反映了比利时学生运动的进一步发展。学生的斗争是从语言问题上引起的，但是很快学生就提出了针对比利时政府的政治性口号。学生的斗争直接触发了比利时政府的危机。
    在群众运动一向比较沉寂的北欧国家和法西斯统治下的葡萄牙，学生们也动起来了。瑞典、挪威、丹麦等国家的学生正在积极参加反对美国侵略越南的斗争，特别在瑞典，这些斗争有着空前的规模。
