In the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive, the soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the Jinan Military Region of the People's Liberation Army have overcome numerous difficulties and built a modern paper mill—the Weidong Paper Mill—in just eight months. Recently, the First Light Industry Department held a nationwide conference on the paper industry at this mill to promote their advanced experience in combining revolution with production.

Last March, when this unit received the task of building the mill and arrived at the construction site, they lived in tents, drank salty water, and walked on alkaline flats. The coastal area was windy and sandy, and conditions were harsh. Faced with these difficulties, the soldiers and officers transformed the construction site into the best classroom for tempering their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao. They used Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive as their weapon, conducted a thorough criticism and self-criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionists like China's Khrushchev on the construction site, and took Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive and the latest directive on "grasping revolution and promoting production" as their guiding principles. Everyone voluntarily struggled against hardships and difficulties. Once, a dam burst, seriously threatening the progress of the project. Upon hearing the news, the soldiers and officers rushed to the dam, fearless of the cold wind and icy water, with a red heart to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, they spontaneously jumped into the water, holding hands and standing shoulder to shoulder to form one human wall after another. Shouting Chairman Mao's words, "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to win victory," they fought for over three hours, repaired the dam, and ensured the smooth progress of the construction project.

During the construction process, the soldiers and officers encountered many technical difficulties. Under the inspiration of the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching, "We can learn what we do not know. We not only are good at destroying an old world, but also will be good at building a new world," they dared to overcome one difficulty after another. During the construction process, the soldiers and officers took the construction site as their battlefield, fiercely criticized the revisionist line of running enterprises by China's Khrushchev and his counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, and their crimes of opposing the publication of Chairman Mao's works. This aroused the deep hatred of the broad masses of soldiers and officers towards China's Khrushchev and his counter-revolutionary revisionist clique. The broad masses of soldiers and officers greatly promoted their revolutionary spirit of daring to make revolution, and launched a vigorous campaign to break old frameworks and foreign dogmas, and to build factories by the masses. Finally, in just eight months, they built a modern paper mill, creating a new record of surveying, designing, preparing materials, constructing, purchasing equipment, and putting into production all in the same year. They also created a new achievement of producing high-quality offset paper using only straw to print Chairman Mao's works.

　　在毛主席“五·七”指示光辉照耀下向艰苦困难作斗争
　　济南部队某部建成一座现代化造纸厂
    创造了当年勘察设计，当年备料施工，当年定货安装，当年投入生产的新纪录，创造了全部利用稻草生产出优质凸版纸的新成就
    新华社济南八日电　在毛主席“五·七”指示的光辉照耀下，人民解放军济南部队某部指战员，克服了许多困难，在短短八个月中建设起了一座现代化的造纸厂——卫东造纸厂。最近，第一轻工业部在这个厂召开全国造纸系统现场会，推广了他们抓革命促生产的先进经验。
    去年三月，这支部队接受建厂任务刚刚到工地时，住的是帐篷，喝的是咸水，踩的是碱滩。海边风大砂多，条件艰苦。在困难面前，指战员们以大无畏的革命精神，把工地变成了锤炼对毛主席无限忠诚的最好课堂。他们以毛主席的“五·七”指示为武器，在工地上坚持开展对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的革命大批判，把毛主席的“五·七”指示和“抓革命，促生产”的最新指示作为行动的准则，人人自觉地向艰苦困难作斗争。一次拦水坝决口，严重威胁着工程的进展，指战员们闻讯后，纷纷向水坝跑去，不怕寒风逼人，不怕冰水刺骨，怀着捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的一颗红心，不约而同地跳进水中，手挽手肩并肩地组成一道又一道人墙，高喊着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的毛主席语录，奋战了三个多小时，堵住了拦水坝，保证了建厂工程的顺利进行。
    在建厂过程中，指战员们遇到许多技术上的困难。大家在伟大领袖毛主席“我们能够学会我们原来不懂的东西。我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界”的教导鼓舞下，敢字当头，克服了一个又一个的困难。在建厂过程中，指战员们以工地为战场，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的修正主义办企业路线和这一伙反革命修正主义分子反对出版毛主席著作的罪行，激起了广大指战员对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的刻骨仇恨。广大指战员敢于革命的无产阶级革命精神大大发扬，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的大破旧框框、洋教条，群众办工厂的高潮，终于在短短八个月的时间里，建成了一座现代化的造纸工厂，创造了当年勘察设计，当年备料施工，当年定货安装，当年投入生产的新纪录，并且创造了全部利用稻草生产出印刷毛主席著作的优质凸版纸的新成就。
