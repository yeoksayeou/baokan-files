"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station, on May 17, issued an article marking the sixth anniversary of U.S. imperialism's invasion of Thailand. The article calls on the Thai people to, under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, persist in armed struggle, expand the united front, expel the U.S. aggressors, and overthrow the Thanom-Sarit traitorous clique.

The article states that on May 17, 1962, U.S. imperialism brazenly dispatched troops to invade Thailand. Over the years, due to the Thanom-Sarit clique's intensified treachery, U.S. imperialism has strengthened its aggression against Thailand. Currently, nearly 100,000 U.S. aggressor troops are stationed in Thailand. U.S. imperialism has built numerous military bases, airports, strategic roads, and various military facilities across Thailand, openly using Thailand as a military base for its aggression against Vietnam and Laos. U.S. imperialism has also controlled Thailand in political, economic, and cultural aspects. In reality, Thailand has become a colony and military aggression base of U.S. imperialism.

The article states that at this critical moment of national survival, in 1965, the Thai Communist Party, holding high the great red banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, bravely led the Thai people to expel the U.S. aggressors and overthrow the Thanom-Sarit traitorous clique, launching a revolutionary armed struggle. Over the past two years, the Thai people's revolutionary armed struggle has flourished and rapidly grown, dealing heavy blows to the U.S.-Thai reactionaries and bringing new hope to the Thai people. The article states that currently, the revolutionary tide of the Thai people is surging, and the struggle against U.S. imperialist aggressors and the Thanom-Sarit traitorous clique is increasingly developing. The U.S.-Thanom clique has already fallen into the Thai people's encirclement.

The article finally emphasizes that the current world revolutionary situation is very favorable to the Thai revolutionary people. As long as the Thai people, under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, steadfastly wage people's war, expand the patriotic democratic united front against the U.S.-Thanom clique, and launch sustained and fierce attacks on U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Sarit traitorous clique, they will definitely be able to expel the U.S. imperialists, overthrow the Thanom-Sarit traitorous clique, and achieve complete victory.

    “泰国人民之声”电台号召人民坚持武装斗争
    赶走美帝推翻他侬卖国集团
    新华社讯　“泰国人民之声”电台十七日就美帝国主义派兵入侵泰国六周年发表文章，号召泰国人民在泰国共产党领导下，坚持武装斗争，扩大统一战线，赶走美国侵略者，推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团。
    文章说，一九六二年五月十七日，美帝国主义悍然派遣军队入侵泰国。几年来，由于他侬—巴博集团变本加厉地卖国，美帝国主义加强了对泰国的侵略，目前，驻在泰国的美国侵略军已近十万人。美帝国主义在泰国各地修筑了大量军事基地、机场、战略公路和各种军事设施，公然把泰国作为它侵略越南和老挝的军事基地。美帝国主义还在政治、经济和文化方面控制了泰国。实际上泰国已经成为美帝国主义的殖民地和军事侵略基地。
    文章说，在民族生死存亡关头，一九六五年，高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗的泰国共产党，英勇地领导泰国人民，为赶走美国侵略者、推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团，开展了革命武装斗争。二年多来，泰国人民革命武装斗争蓬勃发展，迅速壮大，沉重地打击着美、泰反动派，给泰国人民带来新的希望。文章说，目前，泰国人民革命浪潮汹涌澎湃，反对美帝国主义侵略者和他侬—巴博卖国集团的斗争日益发展。美国—他侬集团已经陷入泰国人民的重重包围之中。
    文章最后强调指出，当前世界革命形势非常有利于泰国革命人民，只要泰国人民在泰国共产党领导下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定不移地进行人民战争，扩大反对美国—他侬集团的爱国民主统一战线，向美帝国主义和他侬—巴博卖国集团发动持久的猛烈的进攻，就一定能够赶走美帝，推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团，取得完全的胜利。
