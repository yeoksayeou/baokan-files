Broad revolutionary workers in the textile industry of Wuxi have achieved immediate results by fiercely grappling with class struggle, leading to a month-on-month increase in production.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, May 5th: The broad revolutionary workers on the textile front in Wuxi City have hoisted high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely grasped the revolution, and vigorously promoted production, achieving new victories in both revolution and production. Currently, all 28 cotton spinning, weaving, dyeing, knitting, and hemp factories in the city have achieved revolutionary great unity based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought, and 19 factories have established revolutionary committees. Since this year, the production of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, colored woven fabric, dyed fabric, socks, and hemp cloth in the city has been increasing month by month.

In the process of grasping the revolution and promoting production, the broad revolutionary workers on the textile front in Wuxi have taken the task of holding and holding well Mao Zedong Thought study classes as a top priority. They firmly remember Chairman Mao's great instruction to "never forget class struggle" and focus on class struggle and line struggle education in the study classes. Many factories have also carried out "bitter memories, sweet memories" activities, inviting old workers to share their family history, factory history, and the history of the revolutionary struggle of the working class, thereby greatly enhancing the proletarian consciousness of the workers. In a previous period, the broad revolutionary workers on the textile front in Wuxi actively implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp the revolution, promote production," creating new records in textile production. At this time, a handful of class enemies spread malicious rumors and stirred up trouble, attempting to sabotage the revolution and production. The broad revolutionary workers, armed with Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle, sharpened their eyes, exposed the evil plots of the class enemies, and rooted out this handful of class enemies. Through vivid class struggle facts, the proletarian consciousness of the workers has been greatly enhanced. They voluntarily observe labor discipline, making the revolution and production of the textile industry in the city present a new situation.

In the process of grasping the revolution and promoting production, the broad textile workers in Wuxi closely combine the current class struggle reality, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and deeply carry out revolutionary big criticism, thoroughly criticizing the reactionary revisionist fallacies of "profit-first," "material incentives," and "technology first" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Wuxi. Through revolutionary big criticism, the workers have seen more clearly the wolfish ambitions of the Chinese Khrushchev to oppose socialism and attempt to restore capitalism.

In the process of grasping the revolution and promoting production, the revolutionary workers on the textile front in the city have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, overcoming various difficulties, and achieving outstanding results. The revolutionary workers of the No. 1 Cotton Mill have broken the bourgeois frame, innovated technology, and improved operations in the two production workshops of spinning and weaving, maintaining normal production with less coal, increasing the daily production of cotton yarn from over 100 pieces to 275 pieces, and the quality is also very good. The revolutionary workers of the Hemp Cotton Textile Mill have carried forward the spirit of bravery, fearlessness, and continuous fighting, completing the adjustment, transformation, and overhaul of the hemp cotton workshop one week ahead of schedule, thereby producing more than 80,000 hemp bags for the state and increasing the average daily production of the hemp spinning workshop by more than 16%.

In the fierce struggle to grasp the revolution and vigorously promote production, the revolutionary leading cadres and responsible persons of the revolutionary mass organizations in each factory all work and study with the workers, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, and grasp class struggle.

    无锡全市纺织战线的广大革命职工在抓革命、促生产中，把大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班作为一项头等重要的任务来抓。他们牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，在学习班上狠抓阶级斗争和路线斗争的教育。不少工厂还开展了忆苦思甜活动，请老工人谈家史、厂史和工人阶级的革命斗争史，从而大大提高了职工的无产阶级觉悟。前一时期，无锡市纺织工业战线广大革命职工积极贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，创造了纺织工业生产的新纪录。就在这个时候，一小撮阶级敌人到处煽阴风，点鬼火，妄图破坏革命，破坏生产。广大革命职工用毛主席关于阶级斗争的教导武装自己的头脑，擦亮了眼睛，识破了阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋，挖出了这一小撮阶级敌人。通过活生生的阶级斗争事实，广大职工的无产阶级觉悟大大提高。他们自觉地遵守劳动纪律，使全市纺织工业的革命和生产出现了崭新的局面。
    无锡市广大纺织工人在抓革命、促生产中，紧密结合当前阶级斗争的实际，以毛泽东思想为武器，深入开展革命的大批判，大破中国赫鲁晓夫及其在无锡的代理人推行的“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”、“技术第一”等反革命修正主义谬论。广大职工通过革命大批判，更加看清了中国赫鲁晓夫反对社会主义、妄图复辟资本主义的狼子野心。
    在抓革命、促生产中，全市纺织战线的革命职工们，发扬无产阶级的硬骨头革命精神，克服了各种困难，创造了优异的成绩。国棉一厂革命职工大破资产阶级的洋框框，在纺织两部生产车间革新技术，改进操作，使纺织两部生产在少用煤的情况下，坚持正常生产，棉纱日产量由一百多件猛增到二百七十五件，而且质量很好。麻棉纺织厂的革命职工发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，提前一个星期完成了麻棉车间调整改造、搬车检修的任务，从而给国家多生产了八万多条麻袋，并把麻纺车间的平均日产量提高了百分之十六以上。
    在狠抓革命、猛促生产的战斗中，各厂的革命领导干部和革命群众组织的负责人，都和工人们一起劳动，一起活学活用毛主席著作，一起抓阶级斗争。
