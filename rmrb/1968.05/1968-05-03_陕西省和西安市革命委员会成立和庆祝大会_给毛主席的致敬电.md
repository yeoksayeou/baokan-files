Dearest and Most Respected Great Leader Chairman Mao:

Today, on this day of unity and struggle for the laboring people of the world, the 21 million heroic sons and daughters of Shaanxi report to you with joy: the Revolutionary Committees of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City have been born in victory amidst the great waves of class struggle!

The conspiracy of the Chinese Khrushchov and his accomplices Peng Zhen, Peng Dehuai, Gao Gang, Hab Zhuming, and Liu Lantao to restore capitalism in the Northwest has been smashed! The power usurped by a handful of capitalist roaders has been seized back by the revolutionary masses!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Today, in the 800-li Qin Basin, "the spring breeze and willows are countless." The revolutionary holy land of Yan'an is sending joyous news with every team. Our eyes are filled with tears! We jump for joy! The Yan'an children, who are most loyal to you, sincerely wish you, our dear leader, eternal life! Eternal life!

"In the East, the red sun rises, China has given birth to Mao Zedong." Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! At this most joyous moment, we miss you dearly! We miss you! We miss the thirteen springs you led us in battle in Yan'an, and we miss the countless rivers and mountains you led us across!

Thirty-two years ago, you personally led the Red Army on the Long March of 25,000 li, arriving in victory in northern Shaanxi. From then on, the red sun that never sets rose over the Northwest plateau. Yan'an became the holy land of the great Chinese revolution.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! In the cave dwellings of Yan'an, you wrote volumes of magnificent works, establishing the correct theory, line, principles, and policies for the proletarian revolutionary cause. Your brilliant thoughts guided the Chinese revolution from victory to victory!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your great thoughts on people's war led us to fight north and south, using rice and rifles to defeat the Japanese bandits, drive away the American wolves, and bury the Chiang Kai-shek regime!

The Yan'an Rectification Movement "educated a large number of cadres and united the whole Party," smashing the right-opportunist line represented by Wang Ming and the Chinese Khrushchov!

The great production in Nanniwan broke through the economic blockade of the Kuomintang reactionaries, illuminating the bright future of self-reliance in building socialism!

The battle songs of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University inspired the excellent sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, carrying precious books and wearing straw shoes, rushing to various battlefields!

The great banner of the Seventh National Congress of the Party shone with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, guiding us to fight bravely for the complete liberation of all of China and all of humanity!

"Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory." The Yan'an children who grew up by your side remember your great teachings in the telegram you sent to various circles in Yan'an at the beginning of the founding of the nation, always maintaining the "spirit of hard struggle." In the socialist revolution and socialist construction, we have achieved one victory after another!

The Yellow River with its ninety-nine bends is not a smooth path to revolution. Respected Chairman Mao, you taught us in Yan'an long ago: "All reactionary forces that are about to perish will make their final struggle against the revolutionary forces." For more than a decade, the Chinese Khrushchov stretched his black hand into the Northwest and Shaanxi, recruiting spies, traitors, and capitalist roaders, forming one clique after another, madly opposing your thoughts, creating counter-revolutionary public opinion, and attempting to change the color of the revolutionary base you personally created. The revolutionary red flag cannot fall, and the Yan'an spirit cannot be lost! The Yan'an children, who are forever loyal to you, under your wise leadership, have waged an unyielding struggle against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Under the call of the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism broadcast nationwide at your personal decision, and under the inspiration of your "Bombard the Headquarters," we moved swiftly, holding high the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries" that you gave us in Yan'an, bravely charging towards the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents in the Northwest and Shaanxi, Liu Lantao, Zhao Shouyi, and Li Qiming, exposing their true colors and causing them to collapse completely.

How many sleepless nights we have spent, eagerly studying your brilliant works.

How many dawns with fiery sunrises, we have looked at the rising red sun in the east, singing "The East is Red" loudly.

How many thrilling battles, we have fought under your command, defeating a handful of capitalist roaders.

How many storms and rains have tempered us, making our hearts redder, our eyes brighter, and our bones stronger.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It is you who timely issued the "September 7th Directive," exposing the evil conspiracy of Liu Lantao and his ilk to incite the masses to fight each other; it is your series of latest directives that armed our minds, giving us the courage and strength to achieve complete victory!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! At the critical moment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Liberation Army, personally created and led by you and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, brought us the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The dear PLA firmly "supports the broad leftist masses," with a clear banner and a firm stance. The dear PLA focuses on ideological and political work, carrying forward the traditions of the old Eighth Route Army. The dear PLA, following your affectionate instruction to "carry out heart-to-heart talks, this method is very good," helped us fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, achieving revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination. The land of Shaanxi praises the merits of the "three supports and two militaries" work of the PLA. The Northwest plateau waves the red flag of the model leftist support team of the Miji County People's Armed Department.

"Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Great revolutionary practice has repeatedly proven a truth: loyalty to you is happiness! Loyalty to you is victory! The Yan'an children you personally nurtured solemnly swear to you: forever and ever loyal to you, generation after generation following you!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We must remember your teaching "never forget class struggle," firmly grasping the gun of the proletariat and the pen of the proletariat, continuing to deeply and persistently carry out the great criticism, actively launching attacks on the class enemy, resolutely smashing the rightist reversal wind, exposing all hidden spies, traitors, and counter-revolutionaries, resolutely opposing rightist opportunism, rightist capitulationism, and rightist splitism, resolutely defending the proletarian headquarters headed by you and Vice Chairman Lin, defending the newly born revolutionary committees. Whoever supports Chairman Mao, we are with them; whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we fight them!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We hold a "loyal" heart to you, and we grasp a "use" to your brilliant thoughts. We will set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, fight selfishness, criticize revisionism, using the "Three Articles" as a powerful ideological weapon, raising proletarian awareness, overthrowing bourgeois factionalism, enhancing proletarian party spirit, opposing sectarianism and regionalism. We will carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of Yan'an, becoming thorough proletarian revolutionaries.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We will resolutely carry out your great policies of "supporting the army and loving the people," "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, promote preparedness," and "further economize to make revolution." We will further comprehensively implement your series of latest directives, closely follow your great strategic deployment, and strive to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, turning Shaanxi Province into a red Mao Zedong Thought school!

Dearest Chairman Mao! The heroic 21 million Yan'an children sincerely wish you, the red sun in our hearts, eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

　　陕西省和西安市革命委员会成立和庆祝大会
　　给毛主席的致敬电
　　最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席：
    今天，在这全世界劳动人民团结、战斗的节日里，陕西两千一百万英雄儿女，向您报喜：陕西省和西安市革命委员会，迎着阶级斗争的大风大浪胜利诞生了！
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其死党彭真、彭德怀、高岗、习仲勋、刘澜涛之流在西北复辟资本主义的阴谋被粉碎了！一小撮走资派篡夺了的权力被无产阶级革命派夺回来了！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！今天，八百里秦川，“春风杨柳万千条”，革命圣地延安，队队秧歌送喜报。我们热泪盈眶！我们欢呼跳跃！无限忠于您的延安儿女，最最衷心地祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    “东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东。”毛主席啊，毛主席！在这最幸福的时刻，我们无限想念您，想念您啊！想念您在延安率领我们战斗过的十三个春秋，想念您带领我们跨过的万水千山！
    三十二年前，您亲自率领工农红军，长征二万五千里，胜利到达陕北。从此，西北高原升起了永远不落的红太阳。延安，成了伟大的中国革命的圣地。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！在延安的窑洞里，您写下了卷卷雄文，为无产阶级革命事业制定了正确的理论、路线、方针和政策，您的光辉思想，指导中国革命从胜利走向胜利！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您的人民战争的伟大思想，指挥我们南征北战，用小米加步枪，打垮了日本强盗，赶走了美帝豺狼，埋葬了蒋家王朝！
    延安整风运动，“教育了广大干部，团结了全党”，粉碎了王明和中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的右倾机会主义路线！
    南泥湾大生产，击破了国民党反动派的经济封锁，映红了自力更生建设社会主义的锦绣前程！
    抗日军政大学的嘹亮战歌，鼓舞着中华民族的优秀儿女，怀揣宝书，脚蹬草鞋，奔赴各个战场！
    党的第七次代表大会的伟大旗帜，闪耀着毛泽东思想的万丈光芒，指引着我们为全中国和全人类的彻底解放而英勇斗争！
    “发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”。在您身边长大的延安儿女，牢记您建国初期给延安各界的复电中的伟大教导，永远保持“艰苦奋斗的作风”，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，取得了一个接一个的胜利！
    滔滔黄河九十九道湾，革命的道路不平坦。敬爱的毛主席啊，早在延安，您就教导我们：“凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。十几年来，中国赫鲁晓夫把他的黑手伸进了西北和陕西，他们网罗特务、叛徒、走资派，拼凑了一套又一套班子，疯狂反对您的思想，大造反革命舆论，妄图使您亲手开创的革命根据地改变颜色。革命红旗不能倒，延安精神不能丢！永远忠于您的延安儿女，在您的英明领导下，同党内一小撮走资派，展开了不屈不挠的斗争。在您亲自决定广播的全国第一张马列主义大字报的召唤下，在您《炮打司令部》的鼓舞下，我们闻风而动，高高举起您在延安交给我们的“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，勇猛地杀向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在西北、陕西的代理人刘澜涛、赵守一、李启明之流，把他们打得原形毕露，全线崩溃。
    多少个不眠的夜晚，我们如饥似渴地学习您光辉的著作。
    多少个朝霞如火的清晨，我们望着东方喷薄而出的红日，放声高唱《东方红》。
    多少次惊心动魄的战斗，我们在您的统帅下，把一小撮走资派打得落花流水。
    多少次狂风暴雨的洗礼，把我们锤炼得心更红，眼更亮，骨更硬。
      毛主席啊，毛主席！是您，及时发出了“九·七”指示，揭露了刘澜涛之流挑动群众斗群众的罪恶阴谋；是您的一系列最新指示，武装了我们的头脑，给了我们夺取全面胜利的勇气和力量！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！在无产阶级文化大革命的关键时刻，您亲手缔造和领导的、林副主席直接指挥的中国人民解放军，给我们带来了战无不胜的毛泽东思想。亲人解放军，坚决“支持左派广大群众”，旗帜鲜明，立场坚定。亲人解放军，狠抓思想政治工作，发扬了当年老八路的传统。亲人解放军，遵照您“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好”的亲切教导，帮助我们斗私批修，实现了革命大联合和革命三结合。陕西大地颂扬着工农子弟兵“三支”“两军”工作的功勋。西北高原飘起了米脂县人民武装部支左模范红旗。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”毛主席啊，毛主席！伟大的革命实践反复证明了一个真理：忠于您，就是幸福！忠于您，就是胜利！您亲自哺育的延安儿女向您庄严宣誓：永远永远忠于您，世世代代紧跟您！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！我们一定要牢记您“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，紧握无产阶级的枪杆子、笔杆子，继续深入持久地开展革命的大批判，主动地向阶级敌人发动进攻，坚决粉碎右倾翻案妖风，揪出一切暗藏的特务、叛徒、反革命分子，坚决反对右倾机会主义，反对右倾投降主义，反对右倾分裂主义，坚决捍卫以您为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，捍卫新生的革命委员会。谁拥护毛主席，我们就和他亲；谁反对毛主席，我们就和他拚！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！我们对您心怀一个“忠”字，对您的光辉思想狠抓一个“用”字。我们要大办毛泽东思想学习班，斗私，批修，以“老三篇”为强大思想武器，提高无产阶级觉悟，打倒资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，反对宗派主义、山头主义。我们要发扬延安的无产阶级彻底革命精神，做彻底的无产阶级革命派。
      毛主席啊，毛主席！我们一定要坚决执行您“拥军爱民”，“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”，“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大方针。我们一定要进一步全面落实您的一系列最新指示，紧跟您的伟大战略部署，誓夺无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，把陕西省办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校！
    最敬爱的毛主席啊！英雄的两千一百万延安儿女，最最衷心地祝愿您，我们心中最红最红的红太阳万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    陕西省和西安市革命委员会成立和庆祝大会
