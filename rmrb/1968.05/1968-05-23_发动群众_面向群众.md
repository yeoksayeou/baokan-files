In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Tong County, with boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao, have established amateur, small-scale Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in the countryside. Using various forms of art, they enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought in the fields, at home, and on the streets of the villages. Because the performances are short and to the point, and can closely follow the situation, the performances of some propaganda teams often turn into mobilization meetings, criticism meetings, or meetings to share experiences in criticizing and repudiating revisionism. This has played a certain role in promoting the cultural revolution in the countryside. Therefore, many revolutionary committees of communes and production brigades regard the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams as political work teams in the countryside.

Currently, all 16 communes (farms) and hundreds of production brigades in our county have established Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, and many new people and new events have emerged in the competition to join the propaganda teams. A middle-aged woman, who is already the mother of seven children, still insists on propagating Mao Zedong Thought. She says, "Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao. Not to propagate Mao Zedong Thought is disloyal to Chairman Mao. No matter how many difficulties there are, they cannot affect the propaganda." There is also an old member of the commune who always follows the propaganda team to every performance. He says, "The performances of propagating Mao Zedong Thought, I can never get enough of. Although I can't sing or dance, I can help the propaganda team with the costumes and instruments." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants regard being able to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams as an honor and a duty. Therefore, in our propaganda teams, there are not only many educated youth but also brigade leaders, accountants, and other commune and brigade cadres, as well as people in their sixties and seventies. Some have even established family Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams.

The activities of propagating Mao Zedong Thought in the countryside of Tong County have developed in the midst of fierce struggles between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. The establishment of amateur Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in the countryside has not been smooth sailing. For a long time, the counterrevolutionary revisionist clique within the party, headed by China's Khrushchev, and the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee, have done everything possible to resist Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and to strangle the literature and art of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They look down on us poor and lower-middle peasants and are most afraid of us poor and lower-middle peasants mastering Mao Zedong Thought. In 1965, the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee created a false prosperity in the countryside by promoting clubs and dispatching a group of professional artists to several villages to train "stars." They also talked about serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers with literature and art, but in reality, they were waving the red flag to oppose the red flag. They tried and failed to establish a single experimental point. The masses commented, "Guide and guide, one push and it falls." After their so-called guidance, there were no benefits, but there were many harmful effects. The old and bad plays about emperors, ministers, scholars, and beauties became even more rampant, poisoning the broad masses.

Since the beginning of the great proletarian cultural revolution, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses throughout the country, under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, have thoroughly smashed China's Khrushchev's dream of restoring capitalism. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," we are also determined to change the old cultural face of the countryside. Chairman Mao teaches us, "Our literature and art are for the people, first of all for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Workers, peasants, and soldiers are the masters of literature and art. We poor and lower-middle peasants must occupy the vast ideological and cultural front in the countryside, sweep away all the old and bad plays of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, and turn over the history that has been turned over. Therefore, we have established many Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Now, whether at home or in the fields, there are revolutionary songs and activities of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams everywhere.

Based on more than a year of practice, we deeply feel that to establish amateur Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, mobilize the masses, and only then can we do a good job. Chairman Mao teaches us, "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and relying on them." Learning and propagating the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the urgent demand of hundreds of millions of people and is also the lifelong struggle task of every revolutionary. Therefore, establishing Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams must also mobilize and rely on the masses. If the masses are not mobilized and only a few people are relied on, the propaganda task cannot be completed, and it is possible to fall into the old ways of the old cultural and artistic troupes or amateur drama teams. In the beginning, a brigade in Xiji Commune organized a propaganda team, influenced by the old ways, believing that only a group of "stars" with artistic talents could be selected, and someone had to teach them to do a good job in propaganda. They then designated dozens of people from top to bottom, but after a few days, only a few people were left. The revolutionary committee saw this situation, consulted Chairman Mao's works, examined their own thoughts of not believing in the masses, and through the facts of class struggle, explained the significance of the propaganda team to the masses, arousing the poor and lower-middle peasants' boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. As a result, everyone rushed to join, and even those who had never performed before joined the propaganda team. Now this propaganda team is very active. They not only propagate Mao Zedong Thought but also hold art criticism meetings during rest breaks in labor, criticizing the revisionist poison spread by China's Khrushchev in the countryside.

Based on more than a year of practice, we also deeply feel that only by fully mobilizing the masses can we closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and timely convey Chairman Mao's voice to the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants. If we rely only on ready-made literary and artistic performances by others or on a few people to create them, we cannot timely meet the needs of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. Only by fully mobilizing the masses can we solve this problem. If there are no performances, we create them ourselves. After seeing Chairman Mao's "Statement in Support of the Black People's Struggle Against Violence in the United States," the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team in Sanjian Village, Yongledian Farm, immediately rehearsed a performance and performed it for the commune members the next morning, which was highly praised by the masses. The propaganda team in Shangdian Village, Zhangjiawan Commune, saw that a small group of class enemies in society at that time directed their arrows at the People's Liberation Army, and they were very indignant. During a rest break in labor, they sat on the ground and collectively created a performance singing "In Praise of the Army," praising the People's Liberation Army. A brigade leader in Xiji Commune loves the "Three Articles" very much and voluntarily performed a segment of "The Brigade Members Love the Three Articles" using the tune of the Beijing Dong Drum. He said, "I propagate the Three Articles to the brigade members, and I also follow the requirements of the Three Articles." In Hugezhuang Commune, a brigade leader, an accountant, and a commune member, after studying in the Mao Zedong Thought study class, corrected their own wrong thoughts, turned their process of criticizing and repudiating revisionism into Tianjin clapper talk, and the three went on stage together to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the masses, "We must criticize and repudiate revisionism."

Based on more than a year of practice, we also deeply feel that only by mobilizing the masses can we overcome difficulties and carry out the spirit of "frugality in revolution." The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams are for propagating Mao Zedong Thought and must not be like the old drama troupes that lack everything and ask the brigade for it. We should overcome difficulties, be self-reliant, and not add to the burden of the brigade and the commune members. The propaganda team of Dayang Village Brigade adheres to the principle of not buying if it is not necessary, self-providing if possible, and spending as little money as possible. This propaganda team has spent only a few yuan from its establishment to now. In winter, the team has no large room for rehearsals, only two leaky rooms, and the team members repair them themselves. If there are no instruments, they make them themselves. If there are no hand drums, they paste them with cowhide paper, and if they are broken, they paste another layer. Using self-made instruments, the performance effect is not affected at all. Our county also has many brigades that make their own erhu, yangqin, bass, and hand drums. There are also propaganda teams that have not had a single instrument from their establishment to now. The team members say, "It doesn't matter if there is nothing; as long as there is a heart full of enthusiasm for propagating Mao Zedong Thought, it is enough!" "The sea may dry up, and the rocks may rot, but the heart of propagating Mao Zedong Thought will never change."

    发动群众　面向群众
    北京市通县贫下中农代表会议常设委员会
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们通县的广大贫下中农怀着对我们伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，无限忠诚，无限信仰，无限崇拜的深厚感情，在农村建立了业余的小型的毛泽东思想宣传队，利用各种文艺形式，在田间地头、家庭炕头和农村的街头，热情地宣传毛泽东思想。由于演出的节目短小精悍，能够紧密配合形势，一些宣传队的演出经常变成动员会、批判会或者斗私批修的讲用会，对农村的文化大革命起到了一定的推动作用，所以不少社队的革命委员会都把毛泽东思想宣传队当成农村中的政治工作队。
    目前我们县十六个公社（农场）几百个大队都普遍建立了毛泽东思想宣传队，出现了许多争当毛泽东思想宣传队员的新人新事。有个中年妇女，她已经是七个孩子的妈妈了，但是仍然坚持宣传毛泽东思想。她说：“爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，不宣传毛泽东思想就是对毛主席的不忠。困难再多也不能影响宣传。”还有一个老社员，宣传队每次演出时他都跟着去。他说：“宣传毛泽东思想的节目，我永远看不够。虽说唱的跳的咱不会，但帮着宣传队看看衣服，拿拿乐器还能出点力。”广大的贫下中农都把自己能参加毛泽东思想宣传队看成是光荣和应尽的职责。因此在我们的宣传队里，不仅有广大的知识青年，还有生产队长、会计等社队干部，以及六、七十岁的老人。有的还成立了家庭毛泽东思想宣传队。
    我们通县农村宣传毛泽东思想的活动，是在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中发展起来的，农村业余毛泽东思想宣传队的建立也不是一帆风顺的。长期以来，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团，千方百计地抵制毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，千方百计地扼杀工农兵文艺。他们看不起我们贫下中农，也最害怕我们贫下中农掌握毛泽东思想。一九六五年，旧北京市委在我县农村大搞俱乐部的“繁荣”假象，并且抽调了一批专业文艺工作者在几个村蹲点，培养“尖子”。他们口头上也挂着文艺为工农兵服务，实质上是打着“红旗”反红旗。搞来搞去一个试点也没搞成。群众反映说：“辅导辅导，一扶就倒”。经过他们的所谓“辅导”，好处没有，而遗毒却不少。那些帝王将相，才子佳人的旧戏、坏戏更变本加厉地统治着农村文化阵地，毒害广大群众。
    自从伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动开始以来，全国亿万革命群众在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，彻底摧毁了中国赫鲁晓夫企图复辟资本主义的美梦。我们在毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的指引下，也决心改造农村旧的文化面貌。毛主席教导我们说：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”工农兵是文艺的主人，我们贫下中农要占领农村广大的思想文化阵地，横扫一切封、资、修的旧戏、坏戏，把颠倒了的历史再颠倒过来。于是，我们就大办毛泽东思想宣传队，热情地宣传毛泽东思想。现在不论在家里或在田间地头，到处都有革命的歌声，都有毛泽东思想宣传队的活动。
    根据一年多来的实践，我们深深体会到建立业余毛泽东思想宣传队，必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，发动群众，才能办好。毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”学习和宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是亿万群众的迫切要求，也是每个革命者毕生的战斗任务。因此，建立毛泽东思想宣传队也必须动员群众和依靠群众。如果不发动群众，只靠少数人，就不能完成宣传的任务，就有可能走上旧文工团或业余剧团的老路。西集公社有个大队在开始组织宣传队时，由于受了过去的旧影响，认为只有挑选一批有文艺才能的“尖子”，还得有人教才能搞好宣传队。他们便自上而下地指定了几十个人，可是没过几天只剩下几个人了。革委会看到这种情况，就向毛主席的著作请教，检查了自己不相信群众的思想，通过阶级斗争的事实，向群众讲明宣传队的意义，激发贫下中农无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席的阶级感情，结果大家都纷纷要求参加，甚至连从未演过节目的人也参加了宣传队。现在这个宣传队非常活跃，他们不但宣传毛泽东思想，还在劳动中间休息的时候召开文艺批判会，批判中国赫鲁晓夫在农村散布的修正主义流毒。
    根据一年多来的实践，我们也深深体会到，只有充分发动群众，才能够紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，及时把毛主席的声音传到贫下中农心坎里。如果只靠别人现成的文艺节目，或少数人搞创作，就不能及时地适应广大贫下中农的需要。只有充分发动群众，才能解决这个问题。没有节目，就自己动手编。永乐店农场三间房村毛泽东思想宣传队看到毛主席《支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明》后，连夜编排了节目，第二天一清早就给社员演出，深得群众好评。张家湾公社上店村宣传队看到当时社会上一小撮阶级敌人把矛头指向解放军时，他们非常愤慨，在劳动休息时就坐在地头你一句，我一句地集体编出了表演唱《赞军之歌》，歌颂解放军。西集公社有一个大队长，非常热爱“老三篇”，他便主动地用京东大鼓的曲调自编自演了一段《社员爱读老三篇》。他说：“我向社员们宣传老三篇，也是照老三篇要求自己的。”胡各庄公社有一个生产队长、一个会计和一个社员，他们经过在毛泽东思想学习班的学习，各自纠正了自己的错误思想，把自己斗私批修的过程编成天津快板，三人同时上台向群众宣传毛主席的最新指示“要斗私，批修”。
    根据一年多来的实践，我们还深深体会到，只有发动群众，才能够克服困难，贯彻“要节约闹革命”的精神。毛泽东思想宣传队是宣传毛泽东思想的，决不能象旧剧团那样缺什么都找大队伸手要。应该克服困难，自力更生，不给大队和社员增加负担。大羊村大队宣传队本着能不买就不买，能自备就自备，能少花钱就少花钱的原则办事，这个宣传队从建立起到现在只花了三元多钱。冬天队里没有大房子供宣传队排练，只有两间四面透风的房子，队员们就自己动手修理，没有乐器就自己动手做，没有手鼓就用牛皮纸糊，敲坏了再糊一层。用自做的乐器，一点也没有影响演出的效果。我们县还有不少大队也自己动手做胡琴，做洋琴，做低音胡，做手鼓。还有的宣传队从建立到现在，一件乐器也没有，队员们说，“没有什么都不要紧，只要有一颗热情宣传毛泽东思想的红心就行！”“海可枯，石可烂，宣传毛泽东思想的红心永不变。”
