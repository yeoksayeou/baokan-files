In the midst of the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a brand-new large cargo ship has appeared on the nearby seas of the eastern coast of our motherland. This grayish-white cargo ship, facing the rising red sun in the east, fully loaded with cargo, braves the winds and waves, and strides forward with its head held high.

This cargo ship, the "Chao Yang," is another ten-thousand-ton ocean-going cargo ship built by the revolutionary workers of the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai, with the assistance of many factories and research and design units across the country.

The entire construction of the "Chao Yang" was completed during the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It was born in the storm of class struggle. Its completion once again proves that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country. Its birth is a victory of Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "never forget class struggle."

When the blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, ignited by the great leader Chairman Mao, had just begun to burn, the revolutionary workers of the Jiangnan Shipyard responded to Chairman Mao's call and actively threw themselves into the fiery movement. They resolutely fought against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. At the same time, they seriously carried out Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," determined to build this ten-thousand-ton cargo ship quickly and well. However, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party used two-faced, counter-revolutionary tactics, scheming to sabotage the revolution and production. Initially, they tried to use production to suppress the revolution, blocking the revolutionary masses from seizing the power they had usurped. This trick was quickly seen through by the revolutionary masses. The broad revolutionary workers broke through the suppression of the capitalist roadline, and the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution quickly spread throughout the entire Jiangnan Shipyard.

The panicked class enemies, failing in one scheme, came up with another. They stirred up a counter-revolutionary wind of economism, inciting the deceived masses to leave their production posts under the pretext of "linking up," attempting to paralyze the production of the Jiangnan Shipyard and bring the construction of the "Chao Yang" to a complete halt. At this critical moment, the revolutionary cadres and workers of the Jiangnan Shipyard stood up. They used the magic mirror of Mao Zedong Thought to timely expose the tricks of the class enemies, resolutely stopped the evil wind, and quickly turned the situation around. After a fierce struggle against the enemies and persuasion and education of the deceived masses, many workers who were about to leave their production posts put on their work clothes again, picked up their tools, and marched onto the shipyard with their heads held high. Soon, in the red storm of the January Revolution, the revolutionary cadres of the Jiangnan Shipyard seized the power usurped by a handful of capitalist roaders within the factory, firmly grasped the destiny of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in their own hands, and bravely shouldered the double burden of revolution and production.

The Jiangnan Shipyard was boiling with excitement. The revolutionary workers held denunciation meetings, set up columns for criticism, and fiercely criticized the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the factory. At the same time, they directed the boundless revolutionary enthusiasm unleashed in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution towards promoting production. Seeing that the "Chao Yang" was affected by the counter-revolutionary wind of economism and delayed, they fought against time with the spirit of "seizing the day." Some teams studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, carried forward the spirit of bravely fighting and continuous combat, fearing neither the bitter cold nor the biting wind, and fought day and night by the icy Yellow River. Some teams worked hard and smart, used their brains, found ways, and promoted innovations, with production efficiency increasing several times. The "Chao Yang" on the shipyard changed every day. After this sharp class struggle, the workers finally quickly completed the entire hull construction, achieving the first victory. The workers deeply felt that building ships was a production struggle and even more a class struggle. To seriously carry out Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," one must put revolution in the first place and firmly grasp class struggle to continuously develop production.

After the "Chao Yang" completed the massive hull construction on the shipyard, the struggle did not end. The completion of the hull was only part of the entire cargo ship's construction. Many tasks inside the ship still had to be completed after the hull was launched and moored at the dock. However, a fierce struggle broke out over the issue of "when to launch."

The revolutionary workers of the Jiangnan Shipyard, with their profound proletarian feelings of love for the great leader Chairman Mao, decided to choose the auspicious day of the eleventh anniversary of Chairman Mao's inspection of the Jiangnan Shipyard—January 10, 1967—to launch the ship, as a response to Chairman Mao's warm concern. At this moment, a handful of capitalist roaders within the factory played tricks again, trying to obstruct in every way. They spread rumors, saying, "The tide is too low on January 10, and if we're not careful, something big might happen!" Some conservative technicians, who only knew how to follow the old rules, also chimed in, saying, "Launching in a small tide, the Jiangnan Shipyard has never done that before. If something goes wrong, I can't take the responsibility."

Faced with these arguments, the revolutionary workers were extremely indignant. They decided to overwhelm all enemies with practical actions and would never be subdued by the enemies. At the same time, they also wanted to give those who only knew how to follow the rules a resounding slap. The workers took action from all sides to create conditions for the "Chao Yang" to launch on January 10.

On the shipyard, a fierce battle for time was underway. When oiling the sliding boards on the shipyard, it was originally necessary to remove part of the supports, wait until the oil was applied, install the sliding boards, and then reinstall the supports. Now, using this old method, time no longer allowed it. A carpentry team learned from Chairman Mao's teaching, "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history," daringly imagined and created a new method, completing all the oiling work without removing a single support, saving over two hundred work-hours.

The workers in the dry dock crane workshop, to ensure the safe launch of the "Chao Yang," went to work early in the freezing cold, using the morning ebb tide to wash the launch slide, with the cold water freezing their fingers numb. But they shouted Chairman Mao's battle cry, "Resolutely carry out the decision, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of fearing no hardship, and successfully completed the task.

The workers on the shipyard were fighting fiercely, and the staff responsible for the ship's launch were also carefully studying. They conducted a thorough scientific analysis of the unfavorable conditions for launching early and took many reliable measures, working out a whole set of new launch plans. According to this new method, the ship could be launched in low tide conditions and, once launched, would safely and steadily stop in the middle of the Yellow River, and the entire shipyard would not be damaged during the launch of the "Chao Yang."

January 10, this day of great significance in the Jiangnan Shipyard, finally arrived in the midst of intense struggle. That day, the shipyard was surrounded by flying red flags, booming drums, and cheering crowds. The "Chao Yang," with the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait hanging high, slid swiftly into the Yellow River at a speed of one to two seconds. The banks of the Yellow River immediately erupted in cheers: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long, long live Chairman Mao!" Many revolutionary workers excitedly shook hands with each other, jointly celebrating the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

After the "Chao Yang" was launched, the revolutionary workers immediately sped up the interior installation work. They remembered the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "grasp revolution, promote production" and decided to smash the enemies' plot to sabotage production with practical actions. At that time, some team workers, despite being divided into two factions, would put down their tools and work side by side as soon as they got on the ship. Some teams fully carried forward the revolutionary spirit of collectivism, actively mobilized their forces to support other teams. They supported and helped each other, united as one, and completed the entire "Chao Yang" project in a very short time.

During the construction of the "Chao Yang," the revolutionary workers of the Jiangnan Shipyard, shipping units, and research and design units highlighted proletarian politics and carried out a class struggle to eliminate bourgeois elements and promote proletarian elements. They saw that in the past, cargo ships built by capitalist countries and revisionist countries had a huge gap in living conditions between the leaders on the ship and the ordinary crew members. According to Chairman Mao's teaching, "All our cadres, regardless of their rank, are servants of the people," they reformed this unreasonable design. They saw that foreign ships, in pursuit of loading more cargo and making more money, did not care about the operational safety of the crew and stevedores, designing the ladders inside the cargo holds as narrow straight ladders. If the crew and workers were not careful during operation, accidents would easily occur. Revolutionary technicians and workers closely cooperated, jointly creating a type of inclined ladder that was both safe and did not occupy the cargo hold space. To provide a resting place for dock workers during cargo loading and unloading, they designed a rest room for dock workers on the "Chao Yang," which foreign ships generally did not have.

After going through one fierce battle after another, the "Chao Yang" finally emerged victorious from the storm of class struggle. This ten-thousand-ton ocean-going cargo ship has a displacement of nearly twenty thousand tons and a cargo capacity of over thirteen thousand tons, with a speed of seventeen nautical miles per hour. It can sail continuously on the sea for forty days and nights without stopping at any port, directly reaching Europe, Africa, or America from our country. Last November, after the "Chao Yang" was completed, it sailed lightly for a trial run, achieving success in one trial. Early this year, this cargo ship officially sailed again for a heavy-load trial run. The results of the trial run proved that this ten-thousand-ton ocean-going cargo ship, built during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, had good performance and met the design requirements. Its entry into service will contribute to our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction and support the world's revolutionary people in their anti-imperialist, anti-revisionist struggle.

The news spread, and people enthusiastically cheered: The successful manufacture of this new ocean-going cargo ship vividly and powerfully demonstrated the power of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought!

The "Chao Yang" will forever sail along the revolutionary course opened by the great leader Chairman Mao, braving the winds and waves, and forge ahead!

    迎着阶级斗争的大风浪奋勇前进！
    ——记在激烈的阶级斗争中诞生的“朝阳”轮
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，祖国东部红色海疆的附近海面上，又出现了一艘崭新的大型货轮。这艘银灰色的货轮，迎着东方升起的红太阳，满载货物，乘风破浪，昂首前进。
    这艘货轮，是上海江南造船厂革命职工在全国许多工厂、科研设计单位协助下建成的我国又一艘万吨级远洋货轮——“朝阳”轮。
      “朝阳”轮的整个建造工程，是在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中完成的。它是在阶级斗争的暴风雨中诞生的。它的建成，再次证明：无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。它的诞生，是毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”这一光辉思想的胜利。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自点燃的无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火刚刚燃烧起来的时候，江南造船厂革命职工响应毛主席的号召，积极投身到火热的运动中去，同党内一小撮走资派展开了坚决的斗争。同时，他们认真贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，决心把这艘万吨货轮造得又快又好。但是，党内一小撮走资派使出了反革命的两面手法，处心积虑地破坏抓革命、促生产。起先，他们妄想用生产来压革命，阻挡无产阶级革命派去夺取被他们篡夺的大权。这一诡计，很快就被革命群众识破了。广大革命职工冲破资产阶级反动路线的压制，把无产阶级文化大革命的烈火迅速燃遍了整个江南造船厂。
    一小撮慌了手脚的无产阶级的敌人，一计不成，又生一计。他们刮起了一股反革命经济主义妖风，煽动受蒙蔽的群众借口“串连”，离开生产岗位，妄图迫使江南厂生产瘫痪，迫使“朝阳”轮建造工程完全停顿下来。在这紧要关头，江南厂的无产阶级革命派和革命职工挺身而出。他们用毛泽东思想的照妖镜，及时识破了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，坚决刹住妖风，迅速扭转了局面。经过一番对敌人的坚决斗争和对受蒙蔽群众的说服教育，不少受蒙蔽准备离开生产岗位的职工，重新穿起工作服，拿起工具，昂然走上了船台。不久，在“一月革命”的红色风暴中，江南厂的无产阶级革命派一举夺取了厂内一小撮走资派窃取的权力，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运牢牢地掌握在自己手中，勇敢地挑起了革命和生产两副重担。
    江南造船厂沸腾起来了。革命职工们举行了声讨会，举办了大批判专栏，口诛笔伐，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫和厂内一小撮走资派的累累罪行，同时把在无产阶级文化大革命中迸发出来的冲天革命干劲，用来猛促生产。他们看到“朝阳”轮受到反革命经济主义妖风的冲击，耽误了进度，就以“只争朝夕”的精神争分夺秒加紧战斗。有的小组活学活用毛泽东思想，发扬勇敢战斗、连续作战的作风，不怕严寒冰冻，不顾冷风刺骨，整天战斗在寒风凛冽的黄浦江边。有的小组苦干加巧干，动脑筋，想办法，闹革新，生产效率成倍提高。船台上的“朝阳”轮，一天一个样子。经过这场尖锐的阶级斗争，职工们终于很快就完成了整个船体的建造工程，取得了第一个胜利。职工们深刻地体会到：造船，是一场生产斗争，更是一场阶级斗争。要认真贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，必须把革命放在首位，狠抓阶级斗争，才能不断发展生产。
      “朝阳”轮在船台上完成了庞大船体的建造工程以后，斗争并没有结束。船体的建成还只是完成整个货轮的一部分工程，轮船内部的许多工作，还要在船体下水后靠在码头上进行。但是，在“什么时候下水”这个问题上，一场尖锐的斗争又展开了。
    江南厂的革命职工怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚无产阶级感情，决定选择毛主席视察江南厂十一周年的这个大喜日子——一九六七年一月十日下水，来回答毛主席的亲切关怀。就在这时，厂里一小撮走资派又使出花招，百般进行阻拦。他们大造舆论，说什么“一月十日潮水太小，弄不好会出大事呀！”一些墨守成规、只会按老框框办事的资产阶级技术“权威”，也跟在后面说什么“小潮水下水，江南厂历史上从来没有过，出了事故，我可负不了责任。”
    面对这些论调，革命职工们万分气愤。他们决心以实际行动来压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。同时，也要给那些只会按照常规走路的人们击一猛掌。职工们纷纷行动起来了，从各个方面为“朝阳”轮在一月十日下水创造条件。
    船台上，一场争夺时间的激战正在紧张地进行。在船台上给滑板浇油时，原来必须把一部分撑头拆掉，等浇好油，装好滑板，再装上撑头。现在用这种老办法，时间已不许可。有的木工小组学习了毛主席“人民群众有无限的创造力。他们可以组织起来，向一切可以发挥自己力量的地方和部门进军，向生产的深度和广度进军”的教导，大胆设想，创造了一套新办法，在撑头一根不拆的情况下，仍然完成了全部浇油工作，节省了两百多工时。
    坞吊车间工人为了确保“朝阳”轮安全下水，在滴水成冰的天气里，提前上班，利用早晨的退潮，冲洗下水的滑道，严寒水冷，冻得大家手指发麻。但他们高呼着毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的战斗号召，发扬不怕艰苦的革命精神，胜利地完成了任务。
    船台上工人在激烈战斗，负责货轮下水的工作人员也在精心研究。他们对提前下水的不利条件作了周密的科学分析，采取了许多切实可靠的措施，研究出一整套新的下水方案。按照这一新方法，既能在潮水水位低的情况下下水，又能保证船一下水，就安全地稳停在黄浦江的江心，并且使整个船台在“朝阳”轮的下水过程中不受任何损伤。
    一月十日，这个在江南厂有着重大意义的光辉日子，终于在紧张的战斗中来到了。这天，船台周围，红旗飞舞，锣鼓喧天，人声鼎沸。高挂着伟大领袖毛主席画像的“朝阳”轮，以一二十秒钟的高速度，轻快地迅速滑入黄浦江。黄浦江两岸，顿时响起了一片欢呼声：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”许多革命职工激动地互相紧紧握手，共同热烈祝贺毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，热烈祝贺毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
      “朝阳”轮下水后，革命职工立即加紧进行内部安装工程。他们牢记伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，决心以实际行动粉碎阶级敌人破坏生产的阴谋。在当时，有的小组工人尽管分成两派，大家一到船上，拿起工具，就肩并肩地干得热火朝天。有的小组充分发扬革命的集体主义精神，主动调出力量，去支援别的小组。他们互相支援，互相帮助，团结一致，在很短时间内就完成了“朝阳”轮的全部工程。
    江南厂、航运单位和科研设计单位的革命职工，在建造“朝阳”轮的过程中，突出无产阶级政治，开展了一场灭资兴无的阶级斗争。他们看到过去资本主义国家和修正主义集团统治的国家造的货轮，船上领导人员和一般船员的生活条件相差悬殊，就按照毛主席“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”的教导，对这种不合理的设计进行了改革。他们看到外国船只顾多装货，多赚钱，不顾船员和搬运工人的操作安全，货舱内上下的扶梯设计成很窄的直梯，船员和工人操作时稍不小心，就会发生危险。革命的技术人员和工人密切配合，共同创造了一种既不占货舱位置而又非常安全的斜扶梯。为了让码头工人在装卸货物时有休息的场所，他们在“朝阳”轮上设计了一间外国船一般都没有的码头工人休息室。
    经过一场又一场的激烈战斗，“朝阳”轮终于在阶级斗争的暴风雨中胜利诞生了。这艘万吨级远洋货轮排水量达一万九千多吨，载货量达一万三千多吨，航速每小时十七浬。它能在海上连续航行四十昼夜，中途不停靠任何港口，由我国直接到达欧洲、非洲或美洲等地。去年十一月底，“朝阳”轮建成后，出海作轻载试航，做到了一次试航获得成功。今年年初，这艘货轮又正式出海，作重载试航，试航的结果证明，这艘在无产阶级文化大革命运动中建成的万吨级远洋货轮，性能良好，达到了设计的要求。它的投入运输，将为我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，为支援世界革命人民的反帝、反修斗争，作出贡献。
    消息传来，人们热烈欢呼：这艘新的远洋货轮的制造成功，用最生动有力的事实，显示了我国无产阶级文化大革命的威力，显示了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的威力！
      “朝阳”轮，它将永远沿着伟大领袖毛主席开辟的革命航道，乘风破浪，奋勇前进！
