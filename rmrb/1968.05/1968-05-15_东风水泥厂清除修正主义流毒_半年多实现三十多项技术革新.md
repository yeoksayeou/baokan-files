Revolutionary workers at the Dongfeng Cement Plant in Huangshi City, Hubei Province, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have been fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Chinese Khrushchev for managing industry. This has promoted the ideological revolution among the revolutionary workers. In just over half a year, they have completed over thirty technological innovations. Among these, the nine self-made and modified pieces of equipment alone have saved the state 560,000 yuan and over 200 tons of steel.

The Dongfeng Cement Plant is an old factory. To further develop production, it urgently needs to add some technical equipment. The revolutionary workers of the Dongfeng Cement Plant, with this problem in mind, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "self-reliance," "frugal management of factories," and the great instructions on emphasizing proletarian politics and launching mass movements. They combined these teachings with the actual situation of their factory, fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist garbage promoted by Chinese Khrushchev, such as "experts managing factories" and "technology first." They overthrew and exposed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, such as Chinese Khrushchev, and cleared away the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. This has raised the proletarian consciousness of the revolutionary workers, igniting their boundless revolutionary enthusiasm.

    半年多实现三十多项技术革新
    湖北省黄石市东风水泥厂广大革命职工，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义的办工业路线，促进了革命职工的思想革命化，在半年多的时间里完成了三十多项技术革新项目，其中仅自制和改制的九项设备，就为国家节省了五十六万元资金和二百多吨钢材。
    东风水泥厂是个老厂，为了进一步发展生产，急需增添一些技术装备。东风水泥厂的广大革命职工带着这个问题，学习了毛主席“自力更生”、“勤俭办工厂”和关于突出无产阶级政治、大搞群众运动的伟大教导，结合本厂实际，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬的“专家治厂”、“技术第一”等反革命修正主义黑货，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派斗倒斗臭、清除反革命修正主义路线流毒的革命大批判，提高了革命职工的无产阶级觉悟，焕发起革命职工的冲天干劲。
