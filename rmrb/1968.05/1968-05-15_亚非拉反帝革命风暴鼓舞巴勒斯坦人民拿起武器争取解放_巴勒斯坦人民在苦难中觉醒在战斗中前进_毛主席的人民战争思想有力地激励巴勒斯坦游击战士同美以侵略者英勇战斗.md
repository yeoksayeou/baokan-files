The anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist storm that has swept through Asia, Africa, and Latin America over the past twenty years has inspired the Palestinian people. Their bloody and tear-stained history of suffering has educated them, leading them to find the only correct path back to their homeland. The Palestinian people are increasingly awakening, and they are now fighting on the front lines against American imperialism and the Israeli aggressors.

The Palestinian issue was created by American imperialism to suppress the growing nationalist liberation movements in the Middle East. As early as May 14, 1948, American imperialism established its tool of aggression, the "State of Israel," in the blood and tears of the Palestinian Arabs. On the very next day, May 15, the Zionists launched a full-scale invasion of the Arab countries, burning, killing, and looting everywhere. They occupied 6,700 square kilometers of land, and more than a million Arabs who had lived on Palestinian soil for generations were driven out of their homes and became refugees. Subsequently, the United States and the Israeli reactionary authorities signed a series of agreements, providing Israel with large quantities of weapons and "aid," turning Israel into a dagger stuck in the back of the Arab people. With the support of American imperialism, Israel, in 1956, joined the British and French imperialists in invading Egypt. Last June, under the plotting of American imperialism and the instigation of the Soviet revisionist clique, Israel once again launched an invasion of the Arab countries, occupying the West Bank of the Jordan River, the Sinai Peninsula of the United Arab Republic, the Gaza Strip, and the Golan Heights of Syria. Old grudges and new hatreds piled up, and another batch of refugees was driven out by the Israeli invaders.

For twenty years, whether living in tents and huts in the wilderness for years on end or crowded in the slums on the outskirts of cities, the refugees, especially those who have suffered deeply from American imperialism, have hated it day and night, hoping to drive out these bandits and return to their homes.

In 1965, the torch of armed struggle was lit on Palestinian soil, and the people's armed struggle began. After the outbreak of the American-Israeli war of aggression against the Arab countries last June, the flames of armed struggle burned even more fiercely in the Israeli-occupied areas. A leader of the Palestinian nationalist organization "Fatah," Al-Fatah, said well: "All methods have disappointed us, only the people's armed struggle can liberate Palestine!" A young man who recently joined the Palestinian guerrilla forces proudly raised his gun and said: "Now we have guns, I feel full of energy. We will definitely fight, and we will no longer be refugees. For twenty years, I have always hated the word 'refugee,' but now, for the first time, we feel that we are fighting for Palestine as Palestinians!"

In recent years, at anti-American and anti-Israeli rallies held in various Arab countries, the slogan "Give us guns, we want to fight" can be heard everywhere. The refugees also put forward the bold words "Turn the refugee camps into military camps." Large numbers of young men and women risked their lives, sneaking through secret mountain paths to join the guerrilla training bases and participate in the guerrilla forces. In the training camps, the guerrillas undergo various arduous military training.

In the training camps, the guerrillas are eagerly studying a mimeographed booklet titled "The Experience of the Chinese Revolution." This booklet introduces many brilliant theses from Chairman Mao's "Problems of Strategy in Guerrilla Warfare Against Japan" and the wise policies that Chairman Mao formulated for the Chinese People's Liberation Army, such as the Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. Not long ago, an Arab writer translated some of Chairman Mao's military works into Arabic and dedicated the book to "the Arab fighters on the occupied land—Palestine." In the preface, he highly praised Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war, writing: "At this special moment, when we are required to wage a protracted struggle against Zionism, imperialism, and their agents, translating Chairman Mao's works has become an important and necessary task." A young man named Muhammad said: "After the Middle East War last June, I thought about many problems and read a lot of articles. I found that only Chairman Mao's teachings can save Palestine." Another young man named Yusuf said: "For us Palestinians, the only way is armed struggle. As Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The central task and highest form of the revolution is to seize political power by armed force, to solve problems through war.'"

The Palestinian guerrilla forces have realized the arduousness of their struggle in armed struggle. A leader of "Fatah," Al-Fatah, recently said: "This struggle will be long, very long." He also said: "Since the armed struggle began in 1965, we have relied on and still rely on our own struggle to achieve liberation." "We have always believed that it is unrealistic to use conventional warfare with regular armies at present."

The Palestinian guerrilla forces have achieved a series of victories in armed struggle. Since the beginning of this year, they have launched one or two hundred attacks. In the Israeli-occupied areas, they have laid mines on military roads, blown up military vehicles, attacked enemy strongholds, and ambushed enemy forces, striking fear into the hearts of the enemy, greatly boosting the morale of the people, and dealing a heavy blow to the enemy.

In the battle, the Palestinian guerrilla forces fought cleverly and bravely, showing many moving examples of revolutionary heroism. In a battle in the Tubas area on the West Bank of the Jordan River, after inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, the guerrillas decided to withdraw. The leader of the guerrilla squad, Abu Gazala, was responsible for the covering task. He used clever and flexible tactics to hold back the enemy, allowing his comrades to retreat safely. When he ran out of ammunition and was surrounded by Israeli invaders, he detonated his last two grenades, killing and wounding many enemies, and he himself died a heroic death. A guerrilla in the Gaza area was seriously injured in an attack. He crawled to a village and wrote on the wall with his last drops of blood: "Down with American imperialism!" "The final victory will be ours!" and other slogans, expressing the unshakable belief of the Palestinian people to defeat the American-Israeli aggressors and recover their homeland.

In the Israeli-occupied areas, the broad masses of the people actively support the guerrillas, providing them with intelligence, food supplies, medical treatment for the wounded, and covering their activities. The enraged Israeli invaders have adopted extremely barbaric fascist methods in an attempt to sever the blood ties between the people and the guerrillas. The invaders often gather the residents of some villages together and use all kinds of threats and inducements to force them to hand over the guerrillas, but not a single patriotic Palestinian has betrayed the enemy. On the contrary, more and more young people are joining the guerrillas and taking up arms to fight.

As the great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "At present, the world revolution has entered a great new era." The awakened Palestinian people will definitely smash the counter-revolutionary plot of American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique in collusion with the Israeli aggressors to suppress by force and politically lure and betray, and make new contributions to this great new era.

    巴勒斯坦人民在苦难中觉醒在战斗中前进
    毛主席的人民战争思想有力地激励巴勒斯坦游击战士同美以侵略者英勇战斗
    据新华社十四日讯　本社记者报道：二十年来，席卷亚非拉的反帝反殖风暴鼓舞了巴勒斯坦人民，血泪斑斑的苦难历程教育了巴勒斯坦人民，使他们开始找到了重返家园的唯一正确的道路。巴勒斯坦人民日益觉醒，他们正战斗在反对美帝国主义和以色列侵略者的前哨。
    巴勒斯坦问题是美帝国主义为了镇压中东地区人民日益高涨的民族解放运动而一手制造的。早在一九四八年五月十四日，美帝国主义在巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人的血泪中成立了它的侵略工具“以色列国”。就在第二天——五月十五日，犹太复国主义者就向阿拉伯国家发动了全面的侵略战争，他们到处烧杀抢掠，侵占了六千七百多平方公里土地，一百多万祖祖辈辈生活在巴勒斯坦土地上的阿拉伯人被赶出了自己的家园，沦为难民。接着，美国又和以色列反动当局签订了一系列的协定，给以色列大量武器和“援助”，使以色列成为美国插在阿拉伯人民背上的一把刺刀。以色列在美帝国主义的纵容下，一九五六年伙同英法帝国主义侵略埃及；去年六月，在美帝国主义策划和苏修集团的怂恿下，又一次悍然向阿拉伯国家发动了侵略战争，侵占了约旦河西岸、阿联的西奈半岛、加沙地带和叙利亚的戈兰高地。旧仇添新恨，又一批难民被以色列侵略者赶了出来。
    二十年来，无论是长年累月生活在旷野上的帐篷和茅屋里或拥挤在城郊的贫民窟中的难民们，特别痛恨给他们带来深重苦难的美帝国主义，他们日日夜夜盼望赶走这些强盗，重返自己的家园。
    一九六五年，在巴勒斯坦的土地上点燃起武装斗争的火炬，人民武装斗争开展了。去年六月美以侵略阿拉伯国家的战争爆发以后，在以色列占领区内，武装斗争的火焰更猛烈地燃烧起来了。巴勒斯坦民族主义组织“法塔赫”的领导人阿拉法特说得好：“各种方法都使我们失望了，只有人民武装斗争才能解放巴勒斯坦！”一个参加巴勒斯坦游击队不久的青年小伙子骄傲地举起了他手中的枪说：“现在我们有了枪了，我感到浑身是劲儿。我们要坚决进行斗争，决不再当难民了。二十年来，我对‘难民’两个字一直感到憎恨，现在，我们第一次感到我们是为巴勒斯坦而进行斗争的巴勒斯坦人！”
    近年来，在阿拉伯各国举行的反对美以侵略者的游行集会上，到处可以听到“给我们枪，我们要战斗”的口号。难民们还提出了“把难民营变成军营”的豪言壮语。大批青年男女冒着生命危险，通过秘密的山路投奔到游击队的训练基地，参加游击队。在训练营里，游击队员们受着各种艰苦的军事训练。
    在训练营里，游击队油印的《中国革命的经验》的小册子正在被游击战士们如饥似渴地学习着。这本小册子介绍了毛主席《抗日游击战争的战略问题》中许多光辉论断以及毛主席为中国人民解放军制订的三大纪律八项注意等英明政策。不久以前，一位阿拉伯作家把毛主席的一些军事著作译成了阿拉伯文，并把这本书献给“被占领的土地——巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯战士”。他在前言中高度赞扬毛主席的人民战争思想，他写道：“在这一特殊时刻，即要求我们同犹太复国主义、帝国主义和他们的代理人进行持久斗争的时刻，翻译毛主席的著作已成为一项重要的和必要的任务。”一位名叫穆罕默德的青年说：“去年六月中东战争以后，我考虑了许多问题，读了大量的文章，我发现只有毛主席的教导才能拯救巴勒斯坦。”另一位名叫优素福的青年说：“对我们巴勒斯坦人民来说，唯一的道路是武装斗争。正如毛主席教导我们的：‘革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。’”
    巴勒斯坦游击队在武装斗争中认识到他们的斗争的艰巨性。“法塔赫”领导人阿拉法特最近说：“这个斗争将是长期的，很长期的。”他还说：“从一九六五年开展武装斗争以来，过去依靠、现在还是依靠我们自己的斗争来取得解放。”“我们一直认为当前用正规军队的常规战争是不现实的。”
    巴勒斯坦游击队在武装斗争中取得了一系列的胜利。今年以来先后发动了一、二百次袭击，在以色列占领区内，他们在军事要道埋地雷、炸军车，袭击侵略军据点，伏击侵略军，打得敌人心惊胆战，大长人民的志气，给敌人以沉重的打击。
    巴勒斯坦游击队在战斗中打得机智灵活、勇敢顽强，出现了许多可歌可泣的革命英雄主义的动人事迹。在约旦河西岸图巴斯地区的一次战斗中，游击队在大量杀伤敌人以后决定转移，游击小队的领导人阿布加扎拉负责掩护任务，他用机智灵活的战术拖住了敌人，使战友安全撤退，他在弹尽以后被以色列侵略军包围时，拉响了最后的两颗手榴弹，炸死炸伤了许多敌人，自己也壮烈牺牲了。一个在加沙地区的游击队员，在一次袭击中受了重伤，他顽强地爬到了一个村庄，用他自己最后的鲜血在墙上写下了“打倒美帝国主义！”
  “最后胜利属于我们！”等口号，表达了巴勒斯坦人民誓死击败美以侵略者，收复家园的不可动摇的信念。
    在以色列占领区内，广大人民积极支持游击队，为游击队提供情报，支援粮食，治疗伤员，掩护他们的活动。恼羞成怒的以色列侵略者采取了极其野蛮的法西斯手段，妄图隔绝人民群众和游击队的血肉联系。侵略者往往把一些村庄的居民集中起来，用尽一切威逼利诱的手段，强迫他们交出游击队员，但是没有一个爱国的巴勒斯坦人向敌人告密。相反，越来越多的青年参加游击队，拿起武器进行战斗。
    正如伟大领袖毛主席最近指出的：“当前，世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代。”觉醒了的巴勒斯坦人民一定能够粉碎美帝国主义和苏修叛徒集团伙同以色列侵略者推行武力镇压和政治诱降的反革命两手阴谋，为这个伟大的新时代作出新的贡献。
