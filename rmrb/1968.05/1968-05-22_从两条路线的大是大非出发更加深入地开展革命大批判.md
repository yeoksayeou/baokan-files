Our great leader Chairman Mao, in his epoch-making document "Notice," issued the great call to "criticize the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated into the Party, the government, the army, and various fields of culture." This call has inspired and encouraged hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel across the country to, in an unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launch a revolutionary criticism against the counter-revolutionary clique headed by China's Khrushchev, smashing their evil plot to restore capitalism.

Over the past two years, the great practice of the proletarian cultural revolution has fully proven: revolutionary criticism must start from the fundamental issues of the two lines to achieve great results.

The class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat is prominently manifested as the struggle between the two lines within the Party. The struggle between the two lines within the Party is related to the future and destiny of the Chinese revolution; this is a fundamental issue. Therefore, to carry out revolutionary criticism, we must start from the fundamental issues of the two lines, criticize the revisionist line of counter-revolutionary revisionism represented by China's Khrushchev, criticize right opportunism and the reactionary thoughts of being "left" in form but right in essence, criticize various anti-Marxism-Leninism and anti-Mao Zedong Thought reactionary factions, criticize anarchism, criticize factionalism and sectarianism, and criticize the various manifestations of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes' ideology, so that the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought can fly high on all fronts.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for the purpose of maintaining their power." Under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the focus of the struggle between the two lines within the Party is still concentrated on the issue of power. The clique headed by China's Khrushchev, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, desperately advocate the theory of the "extinction of class struggle," precisely to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat and change the nature of the Party and the state. They promote "material incentives" and peddle the black goods of "three autonomies and one contract" and "four freedoms," precisely to undermine the economic foundation of socialism and change the socialist system of ownership. They madly implement the bourgeois military line, precisely to strip the soul of our army's construction and change the nature of our army. The various counter-revolutionary revisionist poisons they spread in all fields are all for the purpose of subverting the dictatorship of the proletariat and restoring capitalism. Therefore, starting from the fundamental issues of the two lines to carry out revolutionary criticism, we must grasp the fundamental issue of power, closely link the criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line implemented by China's Khrushchev and his agents in various fields with the issue of power, and with the consolidation and strengthening of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Only in this way can the broad masses of revolutionary people understand the necessity, sharpness, and arduousness of the struggle between the two lines, deeply understand the essence of the struggle between the two lines, raise their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, and more consciously defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and consciously safeguard the new revolutionary power.

Starting from the fundamental issues of the two lines to carry out revolutionary criticism, we must always direct the spearhead of the struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party headed by China's Khrushchev, and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. Only in this way can we develop and strengthen our forces, unite the broad masses and the broad cadres, do a good job of revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination, criticize and denounce the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and seize the comprehensive victory of the proletarian cultural revolution.

We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, persist in starting from the fundamental issues of the two lines, and carry out revolutionary criticism in depth and over a long period of time, to clear the ideological obstacles for seizing the comprehensive victory of the proletarian cultural revolution, and to carry out the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end!

    从两条路线的大是大非出发更加深入地开展革命大批判
    北京部队机关无产阶级革命派
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在划时代的文献《通知》中，发出了必须“批判混进党里、政府里、军队里和文化领域的各界里的资产阶级代表人物”的伟大号召，鼓舞和激励着全国亿万军民在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的反革命黑帮展开了革命的大批判，粉碎了他们复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。
    两年来，无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践充分证明：革命的大批判，必须从两条路线的大是大非出发，才能取得伟大的成果。
    无产阶级专政下的阶级斗争，突出地表现为党内两条路线的斗争。党内两条路线的斗争，关系到中国革命的前途和命运，这是大是大非问题。因此，开展革命的大批判，必须从两条路线的大是大非出发，批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的反革命修正主义路线，批判右倾机会主义和形“左”实右的反动思想，批判各种反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的反动流派，批判无政府主义，批判山头主义、宗派主义，批判资产阶级以及一切剥削阶级意识形态的各种表现，使毛泽东思想伟大红旗在各条战线上高高飘扬。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”在无产阶级专政条件下，党内两条路线斗争的焦点，仍然是集中在政权问题上。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派拚命鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，就是为了取消无产阶级专政，改变党和国家的性质。他们大搞“物质刺激”、大肆贩卖“三自一包”、“四大自由”等黑货，就是为了瓦解社会主义的经济基础，改变社会主义所有制。他们疯狂推行资产阶级军事路线，就是为了抽掉我军建军的灵魂，改变我军的性质。他们在各个领域散布的种种反革命修正主义毒素，无一不是为了颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。因此，从两条路线的大是大非出发，开展革命的大批判，必须抓住政权这个根本问题，把对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在各个领域里所推行的反革命修正主义路线的批判，紧紧地同政权问题联系起来，同巩固和加强无产阶级专政联系起来。只有这样，才能使广大革命人民群众懂得两条路线斗争的必要性、尖锐性和艰巨性，深刻理解两条路线斗争的实质，提高阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟，更加自觉地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，自觉地维护新生的革命政权。
    从两条路线的大是大非出发，开展革命大批判，必须把斗争矛头始终指向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派，牢牢掌握斗争大方向。只有这样，才能发展壮大自己的队伍，团结广大群众和广大干部，搞好革命大联合和革命三结合，批倒批臭党内一小撮走资派，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚持从两条路线的大是大非出发，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利从思想上扫清道路，把无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底！
