The publication of the important editorial "The Red and Fragrant Northeast" by the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily has conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the issue of cadres. Some leading cadres at the third session of the Nanjing Military Region's conference of activists in studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong Thought enthusiastically discussed Chairman Mao's latest instructions after studying them repeatedly with fervent revolutionary spirit. They resolutely declared that they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and follow the new situation with vigorous vitality to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

To follow the new situation with vigorous vitality, we must carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "What are the characteristics of the current movement? What are its laws? How should we guide this movement? These are practical problems. ... As the movement develops, there are new things ahead, and new things are endless. Studying the overall situation and its development of this movement is a major topic that we must always pay attention to. 'We must accept new things and study new problems.' The representatives believe that to follow the new situation with vigorous vitality, we must recognize this new situation. In the new situation of development, any thought of relaxing or any mood of stagnation is not in line with objective reality and is not in keeping with the pace of the times. Every proletarian revolutionary must, with a thorough revolutionary spirit, achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The representatives present pointed out that to follow the new situation of development with vigorous vitality, the most important thing is to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment with the revolutionary spirit of 'seizing the day,' to work hard, strive for the forefront, and earnestly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The representatives said that the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Therefore, by grasping the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we grasp the root.

To follow the new situation of development with vigorous vitality, we must carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, firmly grasp the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, and smash the right reversal wind. We must pay attention to studying new problems of class struggle and understand and grasp the new trends of the class enemy. The representatives said: The better the revolutionary situation, the closer the class enemy is to death, and the more they will struggle desperately and launch a frenzied counterattack. We must not be complacent and relaxed because of victory and slacken our struggle against the enemy. We must grasp the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads more tightly and more fiercely. Chen Yongxian, a standing committee member of the Ma'anshan Municipal Revolutionary Committee and political commissar of a certain regiment, said: The better the revolutionary situation develops, the more we must maintain a clear mind, strengthen our awareness of the enemy, and heighten our revolutionary vigilance. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'In human history, all reactionary forces that are about to perish will struggle desperately against the revolutionary forces.' The facts have proven that Chairman Mao's instruction is extremely wise. From the situation in the Ma'anshan area, it is precisely after the establishment of the revolutionary committee that it leads thousands of troops to drag out a small handful of hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries from dark corners and expose them to the light of day.

To follow the new situation with vigorous vitality, we must unite the majority of cadres.

Chairman Mao recently taught us again: "We must believe that more than ninety percent of the cadres are good or relatively good. Those who have made mistakes, the majority can be corrected." The comrades present recognized that Chairman Mao's latest instruction is the most correct and scientific summary of the cadre situation. Through practice, it has been proven that Chairman Mao's teaching that the majority of cadres are good or relatively good is an unshakable great truth. The representatives said: On the issue of cadres, whether to narrow or expand the scope of strikes has always been the dividing line between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the reactionary line represented by China's Khrushchev, and it is also a prominent issue in the struggle between the two classes and two lines in the new situation. The class enemy, in order to protect themselves, tries every means to create divisions in the revolutionary ranks, strike at revolutionary cadres, confuse the two different types of contradictions, expand the scope of strikes, so that a small handful of stubborn walking capitalists can slip through, preserving their counter-revolutionary forces. We must see through the class enemy's tricks and must not be deceived by them. Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the issue of cadres are to make us distinguish between friends and enemies, strictly distinguish between the two different types of contradictions, unite all revolutionary forces that can be united, concentrate forces, concentrate targets, concentrate firepower, and strike at a small handful of class enemies. Let all revolutionary forces, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, form a surging revolutionary army and jointly fight against the enemy.

The comrades present cited many facts to illustrate that earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the issue of cadres and correctly treating cadres, especially those who have made serious mistakes, patiently educating them to return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, is a very important and urgent issue at present. Chairman Mao teaches us: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." Revolutionary leading cadres have rich experience in class struggle and are a precious wealth of the party and the people. They are the backbone force of the new revolutionary regime. Liu Tianchang, a regiment commander, said well: "Releasing one more revolutionary cadre, educating one more revolutionary cadre, and winning over one more cadre who has made serious mistakes but is willing to reform to return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, is to contribute more strength to the revolution, and is a manifestation of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line."

Earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the issue of cadres and uniting and educating the majority of cadres must continue to do a good job of ideological and political work for the vast number of cadres. Representatives participating in the local "three-in-one" power organs said: We must not only do ideological and political work for cadres who have not yet been released according to Chairman Mao's cadre policy, helping them to stand up early, but also do ideological and political work for cadres who have been released, so that they dare to lead boldly and take on the heavy responsibilities of the revolution. Tao Yuzhang, director of the Shanghai Baosha County Revolutionary Committee and political commissar of the county military department, said: "Some cadres who made mistakes participated in the 'three-in-one' leading group and then worked timidly, not daring to lead boldly. We must enthusiastically encourage them to work boldly and take responsibility, let them go to the front line of class struggle to experience the wind and rain, see the world. Let them be tempered and improved in the struggle, and gradually establish their prestige among the masses."

To follow the new situation with vigorous vitality, we must defend the revolutionary committees.

The revolutionary committees are new things that have emerged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line over the bourgeois reactionary line, and a great victory of the broad revolutionary masses over a small handful of capitalist roaders within the party. The representatives believe that after the establishment of the revolutionary committees, the task facing the army is to correctly handle the relationship with the newly born revolutionary committees. The representatives said: The revolutionary committees approved by the great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao are the highest power organs in the locality, and the army must resolutely carry out their instructions and resolutions. Military representatives participating in the revolutionary committees must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlight proletarian politics, be models in studying, executing, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions, be models in political work, models in linking with the masses, models in unity, and models in observing policies and discipline. They must correctly handle relations with all sides, respect revolutionary cadres and revolutionary mass representatives everywhere, and humbly learn from them as their students. Chairman Mao has long taught us: "In the army, we must solve problems from the ideological level of every soldier and officer, making them thoroughly understand the importance of supporting the government and loving the people. As long as the army does well, the local government's relations with the army will naturally improve."

The representatives said: We must be vigilant and see that the class enemy is currently trying hard to find cracks in this area, trying every means to sow discord between the army and the revolutionary committees, disrupting military-civilian unity, and attempting to split and overthrow the revolutionary committees from the right or ultra-left. The more the class enemy opposes the revolutionary committees, the more we must strengthen the unity between the military and the civilians, wholeheartedly cherish and support the newly born revolutionary committees, and strongly consolidate and develop the revolutionary committees, thoroughly smashing all the class enemy's plotting activities.

After the establishment of the new revolutionary committees, where should the power be used? The comrades present said: Revolutionary power should be used to firmly grasp the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, to raise the banner and lead the line, and to lead the broad revolutionary masses to launch a fierce offensive against the class enemy. We must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly eliminate the poison of revisionism spread by the small handful of capitalist roaders within the party over a long period in various fields, and promote our cause in the great criticism of the revolution. Ren Baoshu, deputy commander of a certain division executing the "three supports, two militaries" task in Huainan City, said: As soon as the Huainan City Revolutionary Committee was established, the class enemy directed its spearhead at the newly born revolutionary committee. Therefore, after the establishment of the new revolutionary committee, we immediately grasped the class struggle, mobilized the broadest revolutionary masses to launch continuous attacks on the class enemy, making them dizzy and unable to counterattack, and they suffered a crushing defeat. After striking at a small handful of class enemies, the broad revolutionary masses raised their heads and breathed out, the revolutionary spirit was high, and production was booming. We felt that after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, there were thousands of things to do, but the fundamental thing was to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, earnestly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and firmly grasp the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads.

The representatives present pointed out that after the establishment of the new revolutionary committees, some left-supporting personnel once thought they could relax, and some even thought they could withdraw their troops. The representatives believe that this "withdrawal" mentality is extremely harmful, completely contrary to the interests of the people, and contrary to the interests of consolidating the proletarian dictatorship. The representatives said: With the changing situation of class struggle, the way the army supports the left can change, but supporting the broad leftist revolutionary masses is unchanging.

    全面落实毛主席最新指示朝气蓬勃跟上发展的新形势
    团结绝大多数干部群众集中力量打击一小撮阶级敌人
    出席南京部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会部分代表，热烈座谈学习毛主席的最新指示
    本报讯　《人民日报》《解放军报》重要社论《东北大地红烂熳》的发表，传达了我们伟大领袖毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示。出席南京部队第三届活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会的部分团以上领导干部，满怀无产阶级的革命激情，一遍又一遍地学习了毛主席的最新指示，并举行了座谈。他们坚决表示：一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，朝气蓬勃地跟上发展着的新形势，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。朝气蓬勃地跟上新形势
  就要发扬彻底革命精神
    毛主席教导我们：“当前的运动的特点是什么？它有什么规律性？如何指导这个运动？这些都是实际的问题。……运动在发展中，又有新的东西在前头，新东西是层出不穷的。研究这个运动的全面及其发展，是我们要时刻注意的大课题。”“要接受新事物，要研究新问题。”代表们认为，要朝气蓬勃地跟上新形势，就要认识这个新形势。在发展着的新形势下，任何松口气的思想、停顿起来的情绪，都是不符合客观实际的，都是和时代的脚步不相称的。每个无产阶级的革命战士，必须以彻底革命精神，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    到会代表指出，朝气蓬勃地跟上发展着的新形势，最重要的，就是要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，鼓足干劲，力争上游，认真落实毛主席的最新指示。代表们说，毛主席最新指示的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。因此，抓住落实毛主席最新指示这一条，就抓住了根本。
    要朝气蓬勃地跟上发展着的新形势，就必须发扬无产阶级的坚决彻底革命精神，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，粉碎右倾翻案风。要注意研究阶级斗争的新问题，了解和掌握阶级敌人的新动向。代表们说：革命形势越好，阶级敌人越接近死亡，他们越要作垂死的挣扎，进行疯狂的反扑。我们决不能因为胜利而麻痹松懈，放松对敌斗争。必须对两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争抓得更紧，抓得更狠。马鞍山市革命委员会常委、某团团政委陈用贤说：革命形势发展越好，我们越要保持清醒的头脑，加强敌情观念，提高革命警惕性。毛主席教导我们：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的。”事实证明，毛主席的这一指示是非常英明的。从马鞍山地区的情况来看，正是在革命委员会成立以后，率领千军万马，把一小撮隐藏的叛徒、特务、反革命分子从阴暗的角落揪出来，使他们现形于光天化日之下的。朝气蓬勃地跟上新形势
  就要团结干部的大多数
    毛主席最近又一次教导我们：“要相信百分之九十以上的干部是好的和比较好的。犯了错误的人，大多数是可以改的。”到会同志认识到，毛主席这一最新指示，是对干部情况最正确最科学的概括。通过实践证明，毛主席关于相信大多数干部是好的和比较好的这一教导，是颠扑不破的伟大真理。代表们说：在干部问题上，是缩小打击面还是扩大打击面，历来是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线斗争的分界线，也是在新形势下两个阶级、两条路线斗争的一个突出的问题。阶级敌人为了保护自己，他们千方百计地在革命队伍中制造分裂，打击革命的干部，混淆两类不同性质的矛盾，扩大打击面，以便让党内一小撮顽固不化的走资派滑过去，保存他们的反革命势力。我们一定要识破阶级敌人的阴谋，决不能上他们的当。毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，就是要我们分清敌我，严格划清两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的革命力量，集中力量，集中目标，集中火力，打击一小撮阶级敌人。使一切革命力量在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下汇成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，共同对敌。
    到会的同志列举了许多事实说明，认真落实毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，正确地对待干部，特别是犯有严重错误的干部，耐心教育他们回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，是当前一个十分重要、十分迫切的问题。毛主席教导我们：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”革命的领导干部有着丰富的阶级斗争经验，是党和人民的宝贵财富。他们是新生的革命政权的骨干力量。某团团长刘天昌说得好：“多解放一个革命的干部，多教育一个革命的干部，多争取一个犯有严重错误而又愿意悔改的干部回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，就是对革命多贡献了一份力量，就是忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的表现。”
    认真落实毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，团结和教育绝大多数干部，必须继续做好广大干部的思想政治工作。参加地方“三结合”的权力机构的代表们说：我们不仅要按照毛主席的干部政策，做好还没有解放出来的干部的思想政治工作，帮助他们早一天站出来，而且要认真做好已经解放出来的干部的思想政治工作，使他们敢于大胆领导，勇挑革命的重担。上海市川沙县革命委员会主任、县武装部政委陶玉章说：“有些犯错误的干部参加‘三结合’领导班子以后，工作缩手缩脚，不敢大胆领导。我们要热情鼓励他们大胆工作，敢于负责，让他们到阶级斗争的第一线去经风雨，见世面。使他们在斗争中得到锻炼和提高，在群众中逐步树立威信。”朝气蓬勃地跟上新形势
  就要保卫革命委员会
    革命委员会是无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出来的新事物，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利成果，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线战胜资产阶级反动路线的伟大胜利成果，是广大革命群众和党内一小撮走资派斗争的伟大胜利成果。代表们认为，革命委员会成立以后，摆在部队面前，就有一个正确对待新生的革命委员会的关系问题。代表们说：伟大领袖毛主席和以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部批准的革命委员会，是当地最高权力机构，对它的指示和决议，部队要坚决带头执行。参加革命委员会的军队代表，要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，要当活学活用毛泽东思想的模范，争做学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席最新指示的模范，当政治工作的模范，联系群众的模范，团结的模范，遵守政策纪律的模范。要正确处理同各方面的关系，处处尊重革命干部和革命群众代表，虚心地向他们学习，当他们的小学生。毛主席早就教导我们：“军队中应当从每个指战员的思想上解决问题，使他们彻底认识拥政爱民的重要性。只要军队方面做好了，地方对军队的关系必然会跟着改善。”
    代表们说：我们必须警惕地看到，当前阶级敌人正在这方面使劲地寻找裂痕，千方百计挑拨军队和革命委员会的关系，破坏军民团结，妄图从右的或极“左”的方面来分裂和颠覆革命委员会。阶级敌人越反对革命委员会，我们越要加强军民之间的团结，满腔热情地爱护、支持新生的革命委员会，大力地巩固和发展革命委员会，彻底粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋活动。
    新生的革命委员会建立以后，权用到哪里去？到会的同志说：革命的权要用到狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争上，要举旗抓纲，率领广大革命群众主动地向阶级敌人猛烈进攻。要牢牢掌握斗争大方向，深入持久地开展革命大批判，彻底肃清党内最大一小撮走资派长期以来在各个领域里散布的反革命修正主义毒素，在革命的大批判中来推动我们事业前进。在淮南市执行“三支”、“两军”任务的某师副师长任保俗说：淮南市革委会一成立，阶级敌人就把矛头指向新生的革命委员会。因此，新生的革委会成立以后，我们就狠抓阶级斗争，发动最广大的革命群众，主动地向阶级敌人发起连续的进攻，打得他们晕头转向，还来不及反扑，就遭到了灭顶之灾。打击了一小撮阶级敌人，广大革命群众扬眉吐气，革命热气腾腾，生产蒸蒸日上。我们体会到，革委会成立以后，有千件事万件事，但根本的根本，是要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，深入开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。
    到会代表指出，新生的革命委员会建立以后，有些支左人员一度认为可以松口气了，个别的同志甚至认为可以收兵回营了。代表们认为，这种“收兵”思想是极其有害的，是完全不符合人民利益的，不符合巩固无产阶级政权利益的。代表们说：随着阶级斗争形势的变化，部队支左的方式可以变化，但是，支持左派广大革命群众永远不变。
