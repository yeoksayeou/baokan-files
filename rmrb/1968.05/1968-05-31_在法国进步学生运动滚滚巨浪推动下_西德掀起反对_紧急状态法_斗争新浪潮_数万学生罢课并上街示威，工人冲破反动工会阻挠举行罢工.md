In the face of the unprecedented surge of the progressive student movement in France, the struggle of West German students against the "emergency law" drafted by the West German authorities to accelerate fascism is gaining momentum. Tens of thousands of students are holding class boycotts, rallies, and demonstrations, sparking a massive wave of protests across West Germany. West German workers are also breaking through the obstruction and sabotage of reactionary trade unions to go on strike, joining students in protesting the reactionary law that the authorities are preparing to force through.

On May 28, tens of thousands of students from several dozen universities in West Germany went on strike, and students from some schools occupied the campus. Large numbers of university students, carrying red flags, took to the streets, distributing leaflets, posting slogans, and holding protest demonstrations and rallies. Students also set up picket lines and posted guards outside classrooms to prevent school authorities from disrupting the strike.

In West Berlin, thousands of students chanting anti-Nazi slogans surged towards the Schiller Theater, planning to occupy the theater as a public platform to propagate opposition to the "emergency law." They were brutally suppressed by the police while rushing the theater, with six students being arbitrarily arrested. Angry students smashed the glass doors of the theater with stones. Students and professors at the Technical University of West Berlin held a protest rally, resolutely opposing the Federal Parliament's plan to force through the "emergency law," and their struggle forced the rector to resign.

In Munich, universities held class boycotts, with tens of thousands of students pouring into the city center to hold a mass rally. Students also occupied a theater. In Frankfurt, students from some schools blockaded the rector's residence for two consecutive days. Students at the University of Göttingen took over the school's main lecture hall, using it as a venue for protest activities.

The struggle of West German students has promoted the struggle of workers. In Munich, 200 workers from a steel plant defied the ban of the reactionary trade union and went on strike to protest the "emergency law." At the same time, workers in several other cities also held rallies, strongly condemning the reactionary law.

    新华社二十九日讯　波恩消息：在法国进步学生运动空前高涨的同时，西德学生反对西德当局为加速法西斯化而制定“紧急状态法”的斗争正在蓬勃发展。成千上万的学生举行罢课、集会和示威，掀起了声势浩大、遍及全西德的抗议浪潮。西德工人也开始冲破反动工会的重重阻挠和破坏，举行罢工，同学生一道抗议当局准备强行通过的这个反动法案。
    二十八日，西德几十所大学的数万学生举行了罢课，有些学校的学生还占领了校园。大批的大学生打着红旗，涌上街头，散发传单，张贴标语，举行抗议示威和集会。学生们还在教室外面布置纠察线，站岗放哨，以防止学校当局破坏罢课。
    在西柏林，成千的学生高喊打倒纳粹法西斯的口号，涌向席勒剧院，准备占领这个剧院作为宣传反对“紧急状态法”的公共讲坛。他们在冲剧院时，遭到警察的残暴镇压，有六名学生被无理逮捕。愤怒的学生用石块砸碎了剧院门口的玻璃。西柏林技术大学学生和教授举行抗议集会，坚决反对联邦议院准备强行通过“紧急状态法”，他们的斗争迫使校长辞职。
    在慕尼黑，各大学都举行了罢课，上万名学生冲到市中心，举行了群众大会，学生还占领了一个剧场。在法兰克福，有些学校学生连续两天把校长的住宅封锁起来。哥丁根大学的学生接管了学校主要的讲演厅，把它作为举行抗议活动的场所。
    西德学生的斗争促进了工人的斗争。在慕尼黑，一座钢铁厂的二百名工人，不顾反动工会的禁令，举行了罢工，抗议“紧急状态法”。同时，还有好几个城市的工人也举行了集会，强烈谴责这个反动法案。
