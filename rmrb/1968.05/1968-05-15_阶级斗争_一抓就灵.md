The revolutionary committee of Beijing No. 3 Cotton Mill, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, led the revolutionary workers to take the initiative to attack the class enemies, smashing the class enemies' plot to sabotage production in order to sabotage the Cultural Revolution, and promoting a rapid increase in production. In the more than one month from the end of March this year, the overall production rate of the factory has increased by 32%.

The report says: Our great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution under the condition of socialism, a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang reactionaries led by the broad revolutionary masses, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The revolutionary committee of the state-owned Beijing No. 3 Cotton Mill and the supporting leftist People's Liberation Army organized the revolutionary workers of the entire factory to deeply study and promptly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. By firmly grasping the class struggle, Beijing No. 3 Cotton Mill has seen a new situation in its revolution and production.

The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution gets to complete victory, the more frantically a small handful of class enemies struggle to the death. They sometimes interfere with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment from the right, and sometimes from the extreme "left." They direct their arrows at the proletarian headquarters, at the People's Liberation Army, and at the newly born revolutionary committees. Their more vicious method is to use the means of sabotaging production to obstruct the step-by-step victories of the Cultural Revolution. The class enemies in Beijing No. 3 Cotton Mill are also like this. In order to sabotage production, they frantically incited the masses to engage in anarchism, using the pretext of "opposing revisionism" to incite the masses to disregard labor discipline and not execute reasonable regulations, saying things like "the work is in my hands, I'll do as much as I feel like." They also colluded with the masses to play chess, play cards, eat in restaurants, sleep, raise fish, and stir up issues of wages and benefits during work hours, forcing doctors to issue sick leave even when there is no illness, and so on. Some scoundrels even openly incited workers to be late and leave early, saying things like "the leaders rebel to get an official position, the masses rebel to get an early off-work time."

Due to the sabotage and disruption by this small handful of class enemies, the revolution and production of Beijing No. 3 Cotton Mill were once affected. Old workers watched this with pain in their hearts. They had repeatedly engaged in face-to-face struggles with these bad elements. However, because the new revolutionary power had not yet been established at that time, they did not concentrate their firepower to give the class enemies a head-on blow. These guys were then extremely rampant, openly slandering revolutionary old workers as "fake activists," "grabbing straw," and for a time, things were chaotic.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "... Those counter-revolutionaries who appear in disguise conceal their true nature from people, but they cannot conceal their true nature completely." Chairman Mao's latest instructions further brightened the eyes of the proletarian revolutionary faction and the broad revolutionary workers of Beijing No. 3 Cotton Mill. Under the unified leadership of the factory revolutionary committee and the supporting leftist comrades of the People's Liberation Army, they took Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their weapon and launched a sustained and fierce attack on the class enemies. Based on the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, overcoming bourgeois factionalism, and eliminating the influence of anarchist thinking, the proletarian revolutionary faction and the broad revolutionary workers exposed one by one those traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, rightists, and bad elements who had jumped out during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to sabotage the revolution and production, and implemented mass dictatorship. The entire factory launched a powerful wave of revolutionary criticism. Factories, workshops, and teams held criticism meetings, exposing, criticizing, and fighting against the remnants of the Chinese Khrushchev and the Kuomintang reactionaries within the factory. The broad revolutionary workers unanimously declared that since the class enemies have jumped out, we will not let them slip away, and we will definitely expose their reactionary faces completely in broad daylight and thoroughly smash their sabotage plots. Revolutionary workers also firmly declared that we workers will, with tenfold confidence and a hundredfold effort, resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production" and seize the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Through the revolutionary criticism, the political awareness of the broad revolutionary workers has reached an unprecedented height. They said, Chairman Mao teaches us that "within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interest." In the past, class enemies divided our class brothers into two factions. Now we must unite to deal with our common enemy. The masses of the original two factions shook hands tightly, united as one, and fought shoulder to shoulder, one after another, exposing, denouncing, and accusing the heinous crimes of this small handful of class enemies who sabotaged the revolution and production. The arrogant bad elements were exposed in front of the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought, one by one, and received the punishment they deserved.

In the past, this factory opposed bourgeois factionalism but did not simultaneously eliminate the bad elements and cut off the black hands, so the revolutionary masses of the original two factions could not truly unite in thought. Now that the bad elements have been exposed and the black hands cut off, the worker brothers have truly eliminated the differences in their minds. Some workers said: "Chairman Mao is truly wise! We workers must firmly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and resolutely act according to his teachings!"

Through the revolutionary criticism, Beijing No. 3 Cotton Mill exposed a small handful of class enemies, and the situation of revolution and production changed greatly. The broad revolutionary workers invested the boundless revolutionary enthusiasm released in the Cultural Revolution into the actual actions of firmly grasping the revolution and vigorously promoting production. In just over a month from the end of March this year, the overall production rate of the factory has increased by 32%. The weaving workshop's looms are now all running. Some workshops that had long been unable to complete the production plan are now completing their tasks in excess every day. While firmly grasping the revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory launched the "three loyalties" activity of being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They learned from the experience of Beijing Knitting Factory, and many workshops established the system of "Mao Zedong Thought class exchange." To expand production, many workshop workers voluntarily proposed to expand the workstations. Long-term "old patients" also actively requested to return to work. Good deeds and good people emerged in the factory, and revolution and production improved day by day. Now, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory are seriously implementing Chairman Mao's instructions on "must grasp the cloth production" and continue to firmly grasp the class struggle, promoting cloth production.

    阶级斗争　一抓就灵
    北京国棉三厂革委会在解放军帮助下，率领广大革命职工主动向阶级敌人进攻，粉碎了阶级敌人企图通过破坏生产来达到破坏文化大革命的阴谋，促进生产迅速上升。从今年三月底到现在的一个多月时间里，全厂生产率提高了百分之三十二
    本报讯　我们的伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”国营北京第三棉纺织厂革命委员会和驻厂支左解放军，组织全厂革命职工深入学习和迅速落实毛主席这一最新指示。通过狠抓阶级斗争，京棉三厂革命和生产出现一派从未有过的新气象。
    无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，一小撮阶级敌人就越发疯狂地进行垂死挣扎。他们时而从右的方面，时而又从极“左”的方面干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，把矛头对准无产阶级司令部，对准人民解放军和新生的革命委员会。他们更恶毒的手段是用破坏生产的办法阻止文化大革命的节节胜利。京棉三厂一小撮阶级敌人也是这样。他们为了破坏生产，拚命煽动群众大搞无政府主义，以“造修正主义的反”为借口，煽动群众不遵守劳动纪律，不执行合理的规章制度，胡说什么“活儿在我手里，高兴干多少就干多少”。他们还拉拢群众在上班时间内下棋、打扑克、下饭馆、睡觉、养鱼、闹工资福利问题，没病也要强迫医生开病假条休息，等等。有的坏家伙还公开鼓动工人迟到早退，胡说什么“头头造反捞个官，群众造反捞个早下班”。
    由于这一小撮阶级敌人的破坏和捣乱，京棉三厂的革命和生产一度受到了损失。老工人看在眼里，疼在心里。他们曾经多次同这一小撮坏人展开了面对面的斗争。可是因为当时新生的革命政权还未建立，没有集中火力给阶级敌人以迎头痛击。这些家伙当时猖狂已极，公然污蔑革命老工人是“假积极”，“捞稻草”，一时闹得乌烟瘴气。
    毛主席教导我们：“……以伪装出现的反革命分子，他们给人以假象，而将真象荫蔽着。但是他们既要反革命，就不可能将其真象荫蔽得十分彻底。”毛主席最新指示进一步擦亮了京棉三厂无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工的眼睛。他们在工厂革命委员会和支左解放军同志统一率领下，以毛主席最新指示为武器，主动向阶级敌人发动了持久的猛烈的进攻。在大办毛泽东思想学习班、克服资产阶级派性、消除无政府主义思潮影响的基础上，无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，把在无产阶级文化大革命中跳出来破坏革命和生产的一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派、没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，以及混入革命群众组织里的坏人，一个个揪了出来，实行了群众专政。全厂掀起了声势浩大的革命大批判高潮。工厂、车间、班组纷纷召开批判会，对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派和厂内一小撮国民党反动派的余孽，展开了揭露、批判和斗争。广大革命职工一致表示，既然阶级敌人跳了出来，我们就决不让他滑过去，一定要使他们的反动面目完全现形于光天化日之下，彻底粉碎他们的破坏阴谋。革命职工们还坚决表示说，我们工人要以十倍的信心、百倍的干劲，坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    通过革命的大批判，广大革命职工的政治觉悟空前提高。他们说，毛主席教导我们“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突”，过去阶级敌人把我们阶级弟兄分成两家，现在我们要团结起来，对付我们的共同敌人。原来两派组织的群众，一个个紧密握手，团结一致，并肩战斗，纷纷起来检举、揭发、控诉这一小撮破坏革命、破坏生产的阶级敌人的滔天罪行。嚣张一时的坏人，在毛泽东思想照妖镜面前，一个个原形毕露，得到了应有的惩罚。
    过去，这个厂反对资产阶级派性，没有同时清除坏人，斩断黑手，原两派组织的革命群众因此不能从思想上真正联合起来。现在揪出了坏人，斩断了黑手，工人兄弟真正从思想上消除了分歧。有的工人说：“毛主席他老人家真英明啊！我们工人要坚定不移地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决按照他老人家的教导办事！”
    京棉三厂通过革命大批判，揪出了一小撮阶级敌人，革命和生产形势发生了很大的变化。广大革命职工把在文化大革命运动中焕发出来的冲天的革命干劲，投入到狠抓革命、猛促生产的实际行动中去。从今年三月底到现在，仅仅一个多月的时间里，全厂生产率增长了百分之三十二。织布车间的织布机现在全部开齐。有的长期完不成生产计划的车间，现在也天天超额完成任务。在狠抓革命大批判的同时，全厂革命职工开展了无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动。他们学习北京针织总厂的经验，不少车间建立了“毛泽东思想班班交”的制度。为了扩大生产，不少车间工人主动提出扩台，原来长期的“老病号”，也积极要求上班。全厂好人好事层出不穷，革命和生产日新月异。现在，全厂革命职工正在认真执行毛主席关于“必须把布匹抓紧”的指示，继续狠抓阶级斗争，推动布匹生产。
