	Pingxiang Coal Mine Proactively Attacks the Enemy
	Revolution and Production Situation Growing Better

	The revolutionary committees at all levels of the Pingxiang Mining Bureau in Jiangxi Province, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's support-leftist troops, have firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle," and have been vigorously carrying out class struggle. They have been proactively and unrelentingly launching fierce attacks on class enemies, driving the revolution and production to flourish. The entire mining area is in a great revolutionary situation, getting better and better.

	The Pingxiang Mining Bureau Revolutionary Committee, in light of the current class struggle situation in the mining area, recently held an enlarged meeting of the standing committee with the help of the support-leftist troops. They seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle and fiercely criticized the "class struggle is extinguished" theory of China's Khrushchev. After reaching a consensus, they decided to lead the broad revolutionary masses to proactively launch attacks on class enemies. They took Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice in Pingxiang Coal Mine as an example, went deep into the working faces and residential areas, and mobilized the masses extensively. Soon, a "people's war" of fierce attacks on class enemies swept across the entire mining area.

	"Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." The revolutionary workers of Pingxiang Coal Mine have a deeper understanding of the great significance of Chairman Mao's teaching through their own practice. Many workers have deeply felt that "once class struggle is grasped, even the pickaxe in hand feels lighter." Now, cadres pay attention to vigorously carrying out class struggle and using Mao Zedong Thought to guide production, and production has surged. From April 1 to 25, the coal production in the entire mining area increased by 18% compared to the same period in March. The comrades in the revolutionary committee have deeply felt that "in the past, we grasped the pickaxe and suffered a lot; now, we grasp class struggle and taste the sweetness."

　　萍乡煤矿主动向敌人进攻
    革命和生产形势越来越好
    江西省萍乡矿务局各级革命委员会在人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，狠抓阶级斗争，主动地、不停顿地向阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻，推动了革命和生产的蓬勃发展。整个矿区革命形势一片大好，越来越好。
    萍乡矿务局革委会针对矿区当前阶级斗争的形势，在支左部队的帮助下，最近召开了常委扩大会议，认真学习了毛主席有关阶级斗争的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，大家统一了认识之后，决心带领广大革命群众，主动向阶级敌人发动进攻。他们以毛主席当年在萍乡煤矿的伟大革命实践为榜样，深入到工作面、家属区，广泛发动群众，很快在全矿区掀起了一场向阶级敌人猛烈进攻的“人民战争”。
    “阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”萍乡煤矿革命职工在切身实践中，更深刻地领会了毛主席这一教导的伟大意义。许多工人深有体会地说：“一抓阶级斗争，风镐拿在手里也变得轻了。”现在干部注意狠抓阶级斗争，用毛泽东思想统帅生产，生产飞跃上升。四月一日到二十五日，全矿区煤炭产量比三月同期提高百分之十八。革委会的同志深有体会地说：“过去抓岩嘴斧头，吃够了苦头；现在抓阶级斗争，尝到了甜头。”
