The Chinese Khrushchev spreads poison everywhere, aiming to restore capitalism in China. The "Three Self and One Package" he promotes is driven by this purpose. In the past, some people in our brigade fell for his tricks and opened up some "small wastelands." During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, through revolutionary criticism, the members raised their awareness of the struggle between the two lines. Those who had opened up small wastelands all voluntarily handed them over to the collective. We must thoroughly eliminate the poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev from the minds of every member.

Pursuing "Three Self and One Package" enriches a few individuals while harming the collective. As some cadres and members have said: "Digging up 'small wastelands' ruins the mountain surface, scatters people's hearts, turns the collective into individual farming, changes the cadres, and if it continues, the power will be lost." The Chinese Khrushchev's promotion of "Three Self and One Package" advocates private ownership and protects the private ownership system. He wants to numb the masses and lure them onto the capitalist road to achieve his evil goal of restoring capitalism. Among all poisons, the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's "Three Self and One Package" is the most toxic. It is a harmful fruit, and we must uproot it completely.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "If socialism does not occupy the rural positions, capitalism will inevitably occupy them." "There is no room for compromise on the line issue." Public and private cannot coexist; there is either public or private. "Three Self and One Package" and socialism are incompatible. Keeping a bit of "small wasteland" means not firmly walking the socialist path, not wholeheartedly serving the public, and not wholeheartedly managing the collective economy. Keeping a bit of "small wasteland" means keeping a bit of private interest, planting a poisonous root in the mind, and opening a "backdoor" for the Chinese Khrushchev to peddle capitalist goods.

We must carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, completely eliminate the poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev's "Three Self and One Package," and let Mao Zedong Thought take deep root in our minds. We not only need to hand over the "small wastelands" without leaving a trace but, more importantly, thoroughly eliminate the "small wastelands" of the "self" in our minds, uproot the nest of "self," cut off the tail of "self," and be selfless and dedicated to building socialism wholeheartedly.

　　彻底肃清“三自一包”的流毒
　　贫农社员　王广达
    中国赫鲁晓夫到处放毒，他的目的是要在中国复辟资本主义。他推行的“三自一包”，就是从这个目的出发的。过去，我们队里有人就上过他的当，乱开一些“小荒地”。在无产阶级文化大革命中，经过革命的大批判，社员们提高了两条路线斗争觉悟，原来开小荒地的，都主动地把“小荒地”交给了集体。我们必须把中国赫鲁晓夫散布的流毒从每个社员的头脑中彻底清除。
    搞“三自一包”，肥了少数人，损害了大集体。正象有的干部、社员说的：“刨‘小荒地’把山皮刨烂了，把人心刨散了，把集体刨成单干了，把干部刨变了，发展下去，政权就要刨丢了。”中国赫鲁晓夫大搞“三自一包”，提倡的是私有观念，保护的是私有制度。他要麻醉群众，引诱他们走资本主义道路，达到他复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。千毒万毒，中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”的流毒最毒。它是害人的毒果，我们一定要把它连根带梢一起刨掉。
    毛主席教导我们：“对于农村的阵地，社会主义如果不去占领，资本主义就必然会去占领。”“在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”公和私是不能溶合的，有公无私，有私无公。“三自一包”和社会主义是水火不相容的。留一点“小荒地”，就不能坚定地走社会主义道路，就不能一心为公，就不能全心全意办好集体经济。留下一分“小荒地”，就是留下一分私心，就是在脑子里扎下一条毒根，就是为中国赫鲁晓夫贩卖资本主义黑货开了一个“后门”。
    我们要发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，完全彻底地肃清中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“三自一包”的流毒，让毛泽东思想在头脑里牢牢扎下根子。我们不但要一点不留地交出“小荒地”，更主要的是把头脑里“私”字的“小荒地”彻底清除掉，端“私”字的窝，绝“私”字的后，大公无私，一心一意地建设社会主义。
