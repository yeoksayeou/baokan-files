	“Where Will the 'Ship' Go?”
	Active Learner of Chairman Mao’s Works from a Certain Unit of the PLA
	Meng Fanjie, Ding Jinzhong

	After the Party’s Lushan Conference in 1959 removed Peng Dehuai from his position, the reactionary filmmakers behind “Stormy Waves,” after careful planning, used extremely vile and cunning methods to deliberately insert a scene in the film where Luo Dacheng is removed from his position. They also used the mouth of the old fisherman playing the drums to sing a dirge: “In the wind and waves, you sail the ship, I hold the oar and wait for your return.”

	What kind of “ship” was Peng Dehuai sailing? As the Lushan Conference Resolution pointed out: “At several major turning points in the Party’s history, such as during the Li Lisan line period, the first Wang Ming line period, the second Wang Ming line period, and the Gao-Rao anti-party alliance incident, he stood on the side of the wrong line to oppose the correct line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong.” It is clear that for decades, Peng Dehuai has been sailing a ship of anti-party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought.

	After Peng Dehuai was removed from his position at the Lushan Conference, where will his broken “ship” go? Look, after Peng Dehuai was removed from his position, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, along with Peng Dehuai’s accomplices and the ghosts and monsters in society, desperately cried out for Peng Dehuai, constantly attempting to rehabilitate him. In 1962, in coordination with the domestic and foreign ghosts and monsters attacking the Party, his master—the Chinese Khrushchev—quickly jumped out to rehabilitate Peng Dehuai, saying: “Peng Dehuai’s anti-party program ‘is largely in accordance with the facts’ and ‘does not count as an error.’” Peng Dehuai also believed that the time had come and immediately threw out an 80,000-word rehabilitation book. Clearly, his broken “ship” is heading towards the direction of restoring capitalism, following the navigation route indicated by the biggest capitalist roader within the Party, against the winds and waves of socialism.

	We, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, are the strongest pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must rise up with the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smash and destroy this pirate ship, sinking it to the bottom of the sea, so that it will never resurface!

　　“船”往哪里“行”？
　　解放军某部学习毛主席著作积极分子

    一九五九年党的庐山会议罢了彭德怀的官以后，反动影片《怒潮》的炮制者，经过一番精心策划，用极端卑劣狡猾的手段，特意在影片中编造了一个罗大成被罢官的情节，还借用渔鼓老人的嘴，唱了一首“风里浪里你行船，我执梭标望君还”的招魂曲。
    彭德怀行的是什么“船”呢？正如庐山会议《决议》中指出的：“在党的历史上的几个重大关头，例如立三路线时期、第一次王明路线时期、第二次王明路线时期、高饶反党联盟事件时期，他都站在错误路线方面来反对以毛泽东同志为代表的正确路线。”可见，几十年来，彭德怀行的是反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的贼“船”。
    庐山会议上罢了彭德怀的官，他这艘破“船”还要往哪儿行呢？请看，自从彭德怀被罢官后，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派、彭德怀的死党及社会上的牛鬼蛇神拚命为彭德怀喊冤叫屈，时时妄图为他翻案。一九六二年，配合国内外牛鬼蛇神的向党进攻，他的主子——中国赫鲁晓夫又急急忙忙跳出来替彭德怀翻案说：彭德怀的反党纲领“不少还是符合事实的”，“并不算犯错误”。彭德怀也认为时机已到，立刻抛出洋洋八万言的翻案书。可见，他的破“船”，是要按照党内最大的走资派指引的航道，顶着社会主义的风和浪，往复辟资本主义的方向上行。
    我们中国人民解放军，是无产阶级专政的最坚强的柱石。我们要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，彻底把这艘贼船打翻、砸烂，沉入海底，使它永世不得浮出水面来！
