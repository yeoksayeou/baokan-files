Revolutionary workers, united and working together, are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and have launched a production campaign of mutual emulation.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, SHENYANG, MAY 6 — The broad revolutionary workers of Benxi Mining Bureau, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, have earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. The entire mining area is presenting a thriving and prosperous situation. Revolutionary committees have been established in all coal mines under the bureau. The bureau's raw coal production has increased month by month since the beginning of this year.

	The broad revolutionary workers of this mining area have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and earnestly studied and implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. In mid-April, the entire bureau successfully achieved revolutionary great unity, promoting revolutionary three-in-one combination. Recently, revolutionary committees have been established in all four coal mines of the bureau.

	Under the leadership of the revolutionary committees of each mine, the broad revolutionary workers, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have combined with the class struggle reality of their units to carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, launching unremitting attacks on class enemies. Revolutionary workers, through a thorough criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, have resolutely eliminated their poison, greatly raising their class struggle and line struggle awareness. Revolutionary workers, united and working together, are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and have launched a production campaign of mutual emulation. On the basis of overfulfilling the first quarter's production plan, the bureau also completed the raw coal production plan ahead of schedule in April. The bureau's largest modern mine, Caidi Coal Mine, created a new record of raw coal production in over a year.

　　全局四个煤矿全部成立革委会。革命职工齐心协力，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，掀起你追我赶的生产热潮
    新华社沈阳六日电　本溪矿务局广大革命职工，在人民解放军的帮助下，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，整个矿区的革命和生产，呈现着一派蓬蓬勃勃的大好形势。矿务局所属各煤矿的革命委员会纷纷建立起来。全局今年以来的原煤产量月月提高。
    这个矿区的广大革命职工，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，大办毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习和落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。四月中旬，全局胜利地实现了革命的大联合，促进了革命的三结合。最近，全局四个煤矿全部成立了革命委员会。
    在各矿革命委员会的领导下，广大革命职工，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，结合本单位的阶级斗争实际，深入持久地开展革命大批判，不停顿地向阶级敌人发动进攻。革命职工通过狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线，坚决肃清其流毒，大大提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。革命职工齐心协力，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，掀起了你追我赶的生产热潮。全局在超额完成今年第一季度生产计划的基础上，四月份又提前完成了原煤生产计划。全局最大的现代化矿井——彩屯煤矿，原煤产量创造了一年多以来的最新纪录。
