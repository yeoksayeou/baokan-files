In the great leader Chairman Mao's personally directed and formulated epoch-making document—the May 16 Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966—on its second anniversary, revolutionary heroes and models from various industries and agriculture, as well as activists who actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, are filled with boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. They have written articles to enthusiastically celebrate the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the guidance of this epoch-making document, and to enthusiastically celebrate the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Below are a few of their articles.

With Mao Zedong Thought, One Remains Unshaken in the Storms of Class Struggle

Vice Chairman of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee
Secretary of the Party Branch of Da Zhai Production Brigade, Chen Yonggui

On the second anniversary of the issuance of the brilliant Marxist-Leninist historical document—the May 16 Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966, personally directed by the great leader Chairman Mao—we enthusiastically celebrate the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! The Notification has pointed out the direction of our struggle. Under the guidance of this great historical document, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country have exposed the handful of top capitalist-roaders within the Party, headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, and their agents in various places, and have seized back the power they usurped into the hands of the revolutionary masses. The great victory has been celebrated by all the revolutionary people of China and the world! The imperialists, revisionists, and all reactionaries are trembling with fear!

A thousand victories, ten thousand victories, Mao Zedong Thought has taken root in the hearts of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has been grasped by hundreds of millions of revolutionary people. This is the greatest victory. The broad revolutionary masses have grasped Mao Zedong Thought, and our proletarian dictatorship's ironclad mountains and rivers will never change color. Our descendants will forever follow the bright path of socialism and communism to victory, and the victory of the world revolution will be guaranteed!

We wish our dearest red sun in our hearts, our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao, ten thousand years of life! Ten thousand years of life!

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Da Zhai have followed Chairman Mao in revolution for more than twenty years, experiencing many storms of class struggle. Before and after this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Da Zhai has undergone trials and has been greatly tempered and educated. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Da Zhai, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have stood firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the sharp and complex class struggle, engaging in a head-on struggle with the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanxi Province and Xiyang County, as well as the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie they promoted. We have repelled their ferocious attacks on Da Zhai, defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and protected the red banner of Da Zhai, which Chairman Mao personally raised.

From the practice of class struggle in Da Zhai and from the practice of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have further deeply realized: Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, we must continue the revolution. Without revolution, capitalism will restore itself, the Party will degenerate, the country will change color, and revolutionary people will lose their heads. The main target of the revolution under proletarian dictatorship is the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the organs of proletarian dictatorship and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

The class struggle under proletarian dictatorship, concentrated in one point, is still the power issue. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, in order to subvert proletarian dictatorship, have long disguised themselves as revolutionaries under the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, waving the red flag to oppose the red flag. Their counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics are the most concealed, most treacherous, most cunning, and most vicious. How do we expose these bourgeois representatives who wave the red flag to oppose the red flag? The poor and lower-middle peasants of Da Zhai have personally experienced from years of class struggle, especially from the past two years, that the most fundamental thing is to rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle" and stand on the side of the proletariat, using Mao Zedong Thought to observe and analyze everything and every social phenomenon. We must conduct class analysis on people and things, looking at whether what they say, the measures they take, and the things they do are in line with Chairman Mao's consistent teachings of doing revolution, conducting class struggle, and serving the people, and whether they are in line with the fundamental interests of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and the revolutionary people of the whole country. Anything that does not conform to Chairman Mao's consistent teachings and the fundamental interests of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and the revolutionary people of the whole country is definitely wrong, and we must definitely resist, criticize, and struggle against it. If we do not resist, criticize, or struggle, we will have forgotten class struggle, forgotten proletarian dictatorship, and it will be a surrender and the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the revolutionary masses it leads and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Although the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and all counter-revolutionaries are still struggling desperately. We must seriously study and implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, never be arrogant, never relax, never be complacent, and resolutely oppose right opportunism, right capitulationism, and right splitism. We must always remember class struggle and proletarian dictatorship, and more closely unite with the revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and the revolutionary masses of the whole country, carrying forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat to beat the "falling dogs," and resolutely smash the rightist reversal wind, more fiercely and actively attack the Chinese Khrushchev and all class enemies, attack, attack again, and attack again, advance in victory, develop the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and carry out the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end!

    伟大的毛泽东思想指引我们奋勇前进
    ——各地工农业英雄模范人物纪念《通知》发表两周年著文畅谈文化大革命的伟大胜利
    新华社十七日讯　在伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的划时代的文献——中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》发表两周年的时候，各地工农业英雄模范人物和活学活用毛主席著作积极分子怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，纷纷写文章，热烈欢呼在这一划时代的文献指引下，全国无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性的胜利，热烈欢呼毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。下面是他们写的几篇文章。
    有了毛泽东思想，在阶级斗争风浪中就身不动膀不摇
    山西省革命委员会副主任
    大寨生产大队党支部书记  陈永贵
    在伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的光辉的马克思列宁主义的历史文件——中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》发表两周年的时候，我们热烈欢呼无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，热烈欢呼毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！《通知》为我们指明了斗争方向。全国亿万革命群众在这一伟大历史文件指引下，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮最大的走资派和他们在各地的代理人揭露出来了，把他们窃取的权力夺回到了无产阶级革命派手中。对于这个伟大的胜利，全中国和全世界的革命人民都在纵情欢呼！帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派却吓得发抖！
    千胜利，万胜利，毛泽东思想在亿万革命人民的心中扎了根，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线为亿万革命人民所掌握，是最伟大的胜利。广大革命人民掌握了毛泽东思想，我们无产阶级专政的铁打江山就能永不变色，我们子孙万代就能永远沿着社会主义共产主义的光明大道胜利前进，全世界革命胜利就有了保证！
    我们一千遍一万遍地祝愿我们心中最红最红的红太阳，我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    大寨的贫下中农跟着毛主席干革命二十多年，经过了许多阶级斗争的风浪。在这场无产阶级文化大革命前后，我们大寨又经受了考验，受到了很大的锻炼和教育。用毛泽东思想武装起来的大寨贫下中农和革命干部，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，身不动、膀不摇地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，同中国赫鲁晓夫及其在山西省、昔阳县的代理人以及他们所推行的资产阶级反动路线，进行了针锋相对的斗争，打退了他们对大寨的猖狂进攻，捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，保卫了毛主席亲自树立起来的大寨这面红旗。
    从大寨阶级斗争的实践中，从这一次无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践中，使我们更进一步深刻地认识到：在无产阶级专政条件下，必须继续进行革命。不革命，资本主义就要复辟，党就要变质，国家就要变颜色，革命人民就要掉脑袋。无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象，就是混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，就是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    无产阶级专政下的阶级斗争，集中到一点，仍然是政权问题。党内一小撮走资派为了颠覆无产阶级专政，长期以来，披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，伪装革命，打着红旗反红旗。他们的反革命两面派的手法是最隐蔽、最阴险、最狡猾、最毒辣的。怎样识破这些打着红旗反红旗的资产阶级代表人物呢？我们大寨的贫下中农从多年来特别是从最近两年来的阶级斗争实践中，亲身体会到，最最根本的一条，就是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，靠毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是要按照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，站在无产阶级的立场上，用毛泽东思想去观察和分析一切事物、一切社会现象。对人对事都要进行阶级分析，要看他说的话、订的措施、办的事情，符合不符合毛主席的要干革命、要搞阶级斗争、要为人民服务的一贯教导，符合不符合广大贫下中农和全国革命人民的根本利益。凡是上不合毛主席的一贯教导，下不合广大贫下中农和全国革命人民的根本利益的，就一定是错的，我们就一定要进行抵制，要进行批判，要进行斗争。不抵制，不批判，不斗争，就是忘了阶级斗争，忘了无产阶级专政，就是投降，就是对毛主席最大的不忠。
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”无产阶级文化大革命虽然已经取得了决定性的胜利，但是一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和一切反革命分子，还在垂死挣扎。我们一定要认真学习、贯彻毛主席的一系列最新指示，千万不能骄傲，不能松劲，不能麻痹，要坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾投降主义、右倾分裂主义，要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，要更加紧密地和全国无产阶级革命派、广大革命群众、革命干部团结在一起，发扬痛打“落水狗”的无产阶级的彻底革命精神，坚决粉碎右倾翻案妖风，更加猛烈地主动地向中国赫鲁晓夫和一切阶级敌人进攻，进攻，再进攻，乘胜前进，发展无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，把无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底！
