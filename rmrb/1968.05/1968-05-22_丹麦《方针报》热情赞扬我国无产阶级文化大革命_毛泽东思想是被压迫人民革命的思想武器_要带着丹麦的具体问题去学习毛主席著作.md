	Danish "Policy News" Warmly Praises China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution
	Mao Zedong Thought is the Ideological Weapon of the Revolutionary People Under Oppression
	Study Chairman Mao's Works with Danish Concrete Problems

	Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen: The Danish Communist Labor Group's organ, "Policy News," recently published an article warmly praising the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The article said: "Mao Zedong Thought is not only the theoretical and practical experience of the Chinese revolution, but also the universal theory for the people of past and present colonial and semi-colonial countries to walk the road to liberation and socialism.

	"Mao Zedong Thought is not only the theory of continuing class struggle in socialist society and of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat to consolidate socialism and prevent the restoration of capitalism, but also the theory of contemporary international class struggle."

	The article said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China "has opened our eyes, making us see that Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism." The Cultural Revolution "has made us understand the significance of combining the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete revolutionary practice of each country. This is what Mao Zedong has done and is doing in China. The Cultural Revolution tells us to read Mao Zedong's works with Danish concrete problems."

	The article pointed out that Mao Zedong Thought not only provides weapons for the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, but also for the people of capitalist countries. With this weapon, they can determine the correct path for the future.

	The article said, "Mao Zedong Thought tells us what kind of worldview we should have, enabling us to remain optimistic and full of fighting spirit even in the face of the great influence of bourgeois ideology and bourgeois individualism. Mao Zedong Thought makes us believe that we will ultimately achieve victory for socialism."

	The article pointed out that China's standing in the world helps to accelerate the process of imperialism's decline, helping the people of all countries to realize the day when they can eliminate imperialism through armed struggle.

	The article said: "China's standing as a base for world revolution not only means that the heroic Vietnamese people have a great strategic rear, but also means that the revolutionary and fighting people of the whole world have a strategic rear and strong support in the struggle against imperialism and reactionaries."

    新华社讯　哥本哈根消息：丹麦共产主义工作小组机关报《方针报》最近发表文章，热情赞扬战无不胜的毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    文章说：“毛泽东思想不仅是中国革命的理论和实践的经验总结，而且是现在和过去的殖民地、半殖民地国家的人民走向解放和社会主义的革命道路的普遍理论。
    “毛泽东思想不仅是社会主义社会中继续进行阶级斗争和无产阶级专政下进行革命以巩固社会主义和保证防止资本主义复辟的理论，而且是当代国际阶级斗争的理论。”
    文章说，中国无产阶级文化大革命“打开了我们的眼界，使我们看到了毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰”。文化大革命“使我们懂得了把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同各国的具体革命实践结合起来的意义。毛泽东过去和现在在中国就是这样做的。文化大革命告诉我们要带着丹麦的具体问题去读毛泽东的著作。”
    文章指出，毛泽东思想不仅给亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民以武器，而且也给资本主义国家的人民以武器。掌握这个武器，他们就可以为未来确定正确的道路。
    文章说，“毛泽东思想告诉我们应该具有什么样的世界观，使我们在资产阶级意识形态和资产阶级个人主义影响显然极大的情况下也表现乐观和富有斗争精神。毛泽东思想使我们确信我们会取得社会主义的最后胜利。”
    文章指出，中国屹立在世界上，有助于加速帝国主义衰亡的过程，有助于世界各国人民能够通过武装斗争来消灭帝国主义的那一天早日到来。
    文章说：“中国保持作为世界革命的根据地，不仅意味着战斗的越南人民保存了伟大的战略后方”，而且意味着“全世界革命和战斗的人民保持了战略后方，在反对帝国主义和反动派的斗争中有了坚强的支持”。
