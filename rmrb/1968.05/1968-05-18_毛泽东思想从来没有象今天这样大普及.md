Two years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao personally directed the formulation of the epoch-making document—the May 16 Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966—which sounded the charge for the advance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Under the brilliant guidance of this great Marxist-Leninist historical document, the proletarian revolutionary forces of the First Automobile Works have, after two years of heroic struggle, achieved decisive victory.

For a long time, our factory has been an important battlefield where the two classes, two lines, and two roads have been engaged in a life-and-death struggle. The broad revolutionary automobile workers, who have received the personal care of our great leader Chairman Mao, have made tremendous contributions to the socialist construction of our country and to the support of the world revolution. However, the handful of top capitalist-roaders in the Party, with China's Khrushchev as their head, through their agents in the automobile factory, have done everything possible to block the great voice of Chairman Mao, peddled the black goods of counter-revolutionary revisionism, and vigorously advocated the fallacies of "class struggle is dying out," "production first," "technology first," and "experts first." They have promoted material incentives, opposed serving proletarian politics with production, and engaged in factionalism, subversion, and the use of bad elements. They have placed traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, and landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in important positions, forming a counter-revolutionary independent kingdom hidden within the factory. They have attempted to lead our country's new automobile industry onto the capitalist road and turn our factory into a base for the restoration of capitalism. This fully proves that: "A number of people who have sneaked into the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles and are taking the capitalist road are in fact a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize political power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie."

Automobile workers armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong have always been engaged in a heroic and tenacious struggle against this handful of class enemies. Especially in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with the resolute support of the Red Ninth Company of the People's Liberation Army, which is a model in studying Chairman Mao's works, stationed in the factory, we have launched a fierce attack on the handful of class enemies within the factory, cut off China's Khrushchev's black hand reaching into the automobile factory, and thoroughly criticized and repudiated China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the automobile industry. We have seized back the leadership of the automobile factory from the hands of the proletarian revolutionary forces.

At present, the revolutionary torrent in our factory is surging forward, and production is gradually rising. Especially the great thought of Mao Zedong has never been so deeply rooted in people's hearts as it is today. The factory is holding various types of Mao Zedong thought study classes, which have greatly promoted the ideological revolutionization of the workers. Reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions have become the conscious actions of the broad revolutionary workers.

The situation in our factory is excellent, and the situation throughout the country is excellent. In the face of the great victory of the first proletarian cultural revolution in human history, imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries are terrified and hate it to death. Like witches, they maliciously curse the Chinese Cultural Revolution with a "bleak prospect," and so on. However, the law of history does not change according to the will of these bourgeois gentlemen. Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will certainly achieve greater and greater victories and will have an increasingly great influence on the world revolution.

Under the excellent situation, the broad revolutionary workers of our automobile factory firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never reconcile themselves to their defeat. They will make their last struggles." "We must never relax our vigilance." We are determined, under the brilliant illumination of the Circular, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong thought, to carry out a thorough and prolonged revolutionary criticism and repudiation, and to take the initiative to attack the class enemies. We will thoroughly criticize and repudiate China's Khrushchev and his agents in the factory, fight them down and expose them thoroughly, and completely eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism. We will also root out all traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries hidden in the factory. Especially, we must be good at identifying counter-revolutionary two-faced elements hidden in the revolutionary ranks. We must not only learn to identify good and bad people in normal situations but also learn to identify good and bad people in special situations. We will smash all the tricks and plots of the class enemies and further achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    毛泽东思想从来没有象今天这样大普及
    长春第一汽车制造厂革命委员会
    两年前，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的划时代的文献——中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》，吹响了无产阶级文化大革命进军的号角。在这个伟大的马克思列宁主义历史文件的光辉指引下，我们第一汽车制造厂的无产阶级革命派，经过两年的英勇奋战，已经取得决定性胜利。
    长期以来，我们厂一直是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线进行生死搏斗的重要战场。受到我们伟大领袖毛主席亲切关怀的广大革命的汽车工人，曾为我国社会主义建设和支援世界革命作出过巨大的贡献。但是，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮最大的走资派，通过他们在汽车厂的代理人，千方百计地封锁毛主席的伟大声音，大肆贩卖反革命修正主义的黑货，极力宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论，鼓吹“生产挂帅”、“技术第一”、“专家第一”等谬论，大搞物质刺激，反对生产为无产阶级政治服务。他们结党营私，招降纳叛，重用坏人，把叛徒、特务、反革命分子和地、富、反、坏、右分子安插在一些重要岗位上，组成了一个暗藏在厂内的反革命的独立王国，妄图把我国新兴的汽车工业引向资本主义道路，把我厂变成复辟资本主义的一个根据地。这充分证明：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”
    用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的汽车工人，始终同这一小撮阶级敌人进行英勇顽强的斗争。特别在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们在驻厂支左的人民解放军“学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”等英雄连队的坚决支持下，向厂内一小撮阶级敌人发起了猛烈的进攻，斩断了中国赫鲁晓夫伸向汽车厂的黑手，狠揭狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫在汽车工业战线上推行的反革命修正主义路线，把汽车厂的领导大权，夺回到无产阶级革命派手中。
    目前，我们厂的革命洪流滚滚向前，生产逐步上升。特别是伟大的毛泽东思想，从来没有象今天这样深入人心。厂里大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，大大促进了职工的思想革命化。读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，已成为广大革命职工自觉的行动。
    我们厂的形势一片大好，全国的形势一片大好。在人类历史上第一次无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利面前，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派怕得要命，恨得要死。他们象巫婆那样，恶毒地诅咒中国的文化大革命“前景暗淡”，等等。但是，历史的规律是不以这些资产阶级老爷们的意志为转移的。我们的无产阶级文化大革命必将取得越来越大的胜利，而且将对世界革命产生越来越大的影响。
    在大好形势下，我们汽车厂的广大革命职工牢牢记住毛主席的教导：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”“我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”我们决心在《通知》的光辉照耀下，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，主动地向阶级敌人进攻。狠批中国赫鲁晓夫，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在厂内的代理人批深批透，斗倒斗臭，彻底肃清反革命修正主义的流毒，并把隐藏在厂内的叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子统统挖出来。特别要善于识别隐藏在革命队伍中的反革命两面派。我们不但要学会识别在正常情况下从事活动的好人和坏人，也要学会识别在特殊情况下从事活动的好人和坏人。我们要粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计，进一步夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
