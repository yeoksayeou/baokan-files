Students and residents in Australia have been holding protests in recent days to oppose U.S. imperialist aggression against Vietnam and to oppose the Australian government's role as an accomplice in the U.S. war against Vietnam.

On the 19th, over 500 students from Sydney, Melbourne, and other places gathered outside the residence of Australian Prime Minister Harold Holt in Canberra to hold a protest. The demonstrators chanted slogans, demanding that Australia withdraw its troops from South Vietnam and protesting the government's amendment to the National Service Act, which forces young people to go to South Vietnam as cannon fodder for the U.S. war of aggression. The protesters also condemned the Johnson administration's outrageous "peace talks" deception. The authorities dispatched a large number of police to the scene to suppress the protest, but the students continued their struggle, sitting on the road and chanting slogans against U.S. imperialism and the Australian government. The police arrested 69 students. The arrested students remained steadfast and continued to chant slogans and protest even in jail.

Recently, 120 middle school students from Sydney also went to Canberra to protest against the U.S. war in Vietnam. They carried a petition signed by over 1,000 people, demanding that the Australian government stop conscription and withdraw its troops from South Vietnam. These middle school students also held a protest in front of the U.S. Embassy. Students and staff at the University of Sydney recently held a meeting to protest the government's amendment to the National Service Act to intensify the search for cannon fodder, and five students burned their military service cards in front of the cheering crowd.

Additionally, residents in Adelaide recently held a sit-in protest in front of the local U.S. Consulate to oppose U.S. aggression against Vietnam, and 23 protesters were unlawfully arrested by the reactionary authorities. When the court illegally tried the arrested protesters, the crowd held an angry protest outside the courthouse. In Brisbane, 120 protesters went to the local office of Dow Chemical Company, which manufactures napalm for the U.S., to strongly protest the U.S. imperialists' manufacture and use of napalm to massacre the Vietnamese people. In Perth, protesting youth camped out overnight in front of the U.S. Consulate and continued to hold protests and marches to oppose U.S. aggression against Vietnam.

    反对美帝侵略越南　反对政府充当侵越帮凶
    澳大利亚学生和群众纷纷举行示威
    据新华社墨尔本电  最近，澳大利亚的学生和居民纷纷举行抗议示威，反对美帝国主义侵略越南，反对澳大利亚政府追随美国充当侵越战争的帮凶。
    十九日，在首都堪培拉，来自悉尼、墨尔本等地的学生五百多人在澳大利亚总理戈顿的住宅外面举行了示威。示威群众高呼口号，要求澳大利亚撤回在南越的帮凶军，抗议政府修改国民兵役法，强迫青年到南越去充当美国侵略战争的炮灰。示威者还谴责美国约翰逊政府猖狂玩弄“和谈”骗局。当局派出大批警察赶到现场镇压，但学生仍然坚持斗争，坐在路上高呼反对美帝国主义、反对澳大利亚政府的口号。警察逮捕了六十九名学生。被捕学生坚强不屈，在监牢里高呼口号，继续举行示威。
    一百二十名悉尼市的中学生不久前也到堪培拉举行示威，反对美国侵越战争。他们带了有一千多人签名的请愿书，要求澳大利亚政府停止征兵，从南越撤回帮凶军。这些中学生还到美国大使馆前举行了示威。悉尼大学的学生和职工最近举行大会，抗议政府为加紧搜罗炮灰而修改国民兵役法，有五个学生在群众的欢呼声中当场烧毁了兵役证。
    此外，阿得雷德市的群众最近在当地美国领事馆前举行反对美国侵略越南的静坐示威，有二十三名示威者被反动当局无理逮捕。当法庭非法审讯被捕者时，群众又在法院外面举行了愤怒的抗议示威。在布里斯班市，一百二十名示威群众前往美国制造凝固汽油弹的道氏化学公司在当地的办事处，强烈抗议美帝国主义制造和使用凝固汽油弹屠杀越南人民。在珀思市，示威青年在美国领事馆外面扎营过夜，并继续举行示威游行，抗议美帝侵略越南。
