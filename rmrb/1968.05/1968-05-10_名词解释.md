    Explanations of Terms

    “Kennedy Round” Negotiations

    The “Kennedy Round” negotiations were a series of tariff talks lasting over four years between the major capitalist countries, particularly the United States, Britain, and the West European “Common Market” countries. This round of negotiations took place against the backdrop of a shrinking capitalist world market and intensifying competition for economic hegemony among Western countries. The negotiations were initiated by former U.S. President John F. Kennedy, hence the name “Kennedy Round” tariff negotiations.

    The negotiations began in 1963. The United States proposed a uniform 50% reduction in tariffs, but this was rejected by the West European “Common Market.” After several breakdowns, an agreement was finally reached in May 1967: over the next five years, tariffs would be gradually reduced by approximately one-third. The U.S. initiated these negotiations to dismantle the tariff barriers of the “Common Market” countries, allowing American goods to flood into these markets. However, because the West European “Common Market” countries listed thousands of industrial products, fearing competition from American goods, as exceptions not subject to the tariff reduction agreement, the United States did not gain much from the results of these negotiations.

    Value-Added Tax

    Starting this year, the West European “Common Market” countries will impose a consumption tax on their domestic products. This is essentially a tool for waging a trade war against other capitalist countries, particularly the United States. This consumption tax is levied based on the increase in the price of goods, hence the name value-added tax. This trading bloc has decided to impose the same tax on imported goods while exempting domestic exports from this tax. This new system will place American goods at a significant disadvantage in international markets, prompting the United States to threaten retaliation.

    Export of Services

    This refers to “invisible exports” or non-commodity exports. In a country’s international balance of payments, all income derived from sources other than commodity exports is considered service exports. This includes international freight charges, insurance premiums paid by foreign companies to domestic insurers, foreign interest income, dividends from overseas investments, expenditures by foreigners traveling to the country, repair fees for foreign vessels docked at domestic ports, patent royalties, and remittances from overseas Chinese, among others.

　　名词解释
　　“肯尼迪回合”谈判
    “肯尼迪回合”谈判是资本主义世界主要国家，特别是美国、英国同西欧“共同市场”国家之间进行的一次长达四年多的关税谈判。这次谈判是在资本主义世界市场日益缩小，西方国家争夺经济霸权越来越趋于你死我活的背景下举行的。因为这次谈判是美国前总统肯尼迪所发起的，所以叫做“肯尼迪回合”关税谈判。
    这次谈判开始于一九六三年。美国曾提出了一律减税百分之五十的建议，但为西欧“共同市场”所拒绝。中间经过几度破裂，到一九六七年五月才算勉强达成一个协议：今后五年内逐步互减关税三分之一左右。美国发起这个谈判的目的，是要拆除“共同市场”国家的关税壁垒，以便于美国货大举进入“共同市场”国家。但是，由于西欧“共同市场”国家把上千种担心美国货竞争的工业品列入不受减税协议约束的“例外”名单，因此美国并未从这次谈判的结果中占到什么便宜。
    增值税
    西欧“共同市场”国家从今年一月起将对它们国内产品征收一种消费税。这实际上是一种同其他资本主义国家，特别是美国，进行贸易战的手段。这种消费税是按货物价格的增加而加收的，所以叫做增值税。这个贸易集团决定对进口品同样要征收这种税，而对本国的出口货则要减免这种税。这一新的制度实行后，将使美国货在国际市场上处于极不利的竞争地位，所以美国扬言要进行报复。
    劳务出口
    即“无形输出”，又称非商品输出。一个国家在国际收支中不是因商品输出而带来的各项收入都属于劳务出口。它包括国际运费、外国公司付给本国保险业的保险费、国外利息收入、在国外投资的红利、外国人到本国来的国际旅行开支、本国港口停泊的外国船舶的修理费、专利特许权、侨汇等等。
