The Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Cotton Mill No. 3 and the supporting People's Liberation Army, following Chairman Mao's instruction on "class struggle, once grasped, will be effective," have organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the factory. Revolutionary workers have heightened their class consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle, sharpened their eyes, and launched a sustained and fierce attack on class enemies.

Amidst the triumphant songs of class struggle, revolutionary workers resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "seize the revolution and promote production." Various workshops, teams, and individuals have engaged in competitive revolutionary emulation, with production waves surging higher and higher.

Through revolutionary criticism and struggle, a handful of class enemies who sabotaged the revolution and production were exposed. Revolutionary workers throughout the factory further understood the great significance of Chairman Mao's teaching that "within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest." Formerly divided into two factions, class sisters now talk heart-to-heart, unite as one, and fight shoulder to shoulder.

Revolutionary cadres of the entire factory, taking Beijing Knitting Factory and other advanced units as examples, have vigorously carried out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and the "Three Loyalty" activities. The political consciousness of revolutionary workers has reached unprecedented heights.

Now, revolutionary workers are earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's directive to "ensure the production of cloth," striving for excellence, and making new contributions in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    北京国棉三厂革命委员会和驻厂支左解放军，遵照毛主席关于“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的教导，在全厂大办毛泽东思想学习班。广大革命职工提高了无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，擦亮了眼睛，向阶级敌人发动了持久猛烈的进攻。
    在阶级斗争胜利的凯歌声中，广大革命职工坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，各车间、小组和个人之间开展了你追我赶的革命竞赛，生产热潮一浪高过一浪。
    通过革命大批判，揪出了一小撮破坏革命、破坏生产的阶级敌人，全厂革命职工进一步认识到毛主席关于“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突”的教导的伟大意义，原来分成两派的阶级姐妹，现在互相谈心、团结一致、并肩战斗。
    全厂无产阶级革命派，以北京针织总厂和其他先进单位为榜样，大力开展活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动，开展“三忠于”活动。广大革命职工的政治觉悟空前提高。
    现在，广大革命职工认真执行毛主席关于“必须把布匹抓紧”的指示，鼓足干劲，力争上游，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利中立新功。此栏照片是本报记者摄
