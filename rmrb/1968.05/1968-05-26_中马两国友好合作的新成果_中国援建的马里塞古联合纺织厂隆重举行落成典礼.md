The completion ceremony of the Segou Joint Textile Mill, built with Chinese aid, was held in Segou, the second-largest city in Mali, on May 21. Mali's President, Chairman of the National Committee for the Defense of the Revolution, Modibo Keita, and his wife attended the ceremony.

On that day, more than ten thousand residents of Segou proudly wore clothes made from fabric produced by the textile mill. They gathered in the square opposite the factory and along the streets, celebrating the birth of Mali's first textile factory and the new achievements in Sino-Malian friendship and cooperation. They held banners with slogans such as "Long Live Mali-China Friendship!", "No Economic Independence, No True Independence!", and "Self-Reliance!"

Among the attendees were members of the National Committee for the Defense of the Revolution: Mamadou Madera Keita, Sedou Badian Kouyate, and David Coulibaly; Minister of Planning Jean-Marie Koné; Minister of Finance Louis Negre; Minister of Trade Attaer Megat; Minister of National Education Sedou Traore; and many foreign diplomats stationed in Mali, as well as Chinese technical personnel working there.

Sara Niar, the Secretary of State for Rural Economy, Power, and Industry at the Malian Presidency, spoke at the ceremony. He pointed out that the completion of this joint textile mill is a fruit of Sino-Malian cooperation. He emphasized, "For the brave Chinese people, inspired by the great thought of Mao Zedong, proletarian internationalism is not an empty slogan but a vibrant idea. This idea mobilizes the progressive and just people of all countries to engage in fierce struggles against oppression and exploitation on all fronts."

Sambala Sisoko, the General Manager of the Segou Joint Textile Mill, also spoke. He noted that, unlike capitalist systems, "The People's Republic of China, with its sincere, effective, and substantial aid, always strives, out of a reasonable consideration to fight imperialism, to enable countries that have taken the path of development to master such means of production so that they can act according to their own possibilities and create the conditions for their complete liberation." He also praised the humble attitude of the Chinese technical personnel.

Liu He Lin, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Mali, congratulated Modibo Keita, the Malian government, and people on the birth of Mali's textile industry. He also expressed heartfelt thanks for their support and concern for the work of the Chinese technical personnel.

After President Modibo Keita cut the ribbon for the mill's completion, he and Liu He Lin entered the Segou Joint Textile Mill. They first paid their respects at the grave of the martyr Shi Yuekang. Then, accompanied by the mill's General Manager Sambala Sisoko and the leader of the Chinese technical team, Zhu Ping Shan, they toured the factory.

    中马两国友好合作的新成果
   中国援建的马里塞古联合纺织厂隆重举行落成典礼
    据新华社巴马科电  由中国援助建设的马里塞古联合纺织厂二十一日在马里第二大城市塞古隆重举行落成典礼。马里共和国总统、马里保卫革命全国委员会主席莫迪博·凯塔和夫人出席了典礼。
    这一天，塞古城的一万多名居民自豪地穿着由这个纺织厂生产的布匹做成的衣服，聚集在这座工厂对面的广场上和街道两旁，庆祝马里第一个纺织工厂的诞生，欢呼马中两国友好和合作关系的新成果。他们高举横幅，上面写着：“马中人民友谊是永恒的！”“没有经济独立，就没有真正的独立！”“自力更生！”
    出席落成典礼的有：马里保卫革命全国委员会成员马马杜·马戴拉·凯塔、塞杜·巴迪昂·库亚特、戴维·库利巴利，计划部长让—马里·科奈，财政部长路易·内格尔，贸易部长阿塔埃尔·梅加，国民教育部长塞杜·塔勒，以及许多国家驻马里的外交使节和在这里工作的中国技术人员。
    马里总统府负责农村经济、动力和工业国务秘书萨拉·尼亚尔在落成典礼上的讲话中指出，这座联合纺织厂的落成，是马中两国合作的成果。他强调说：“对于受到伟大的毛泽东思想鼓舞的英勇的中国人民来说，无产阶级国际主义根本不是一句空洞的口号，而是一种生气勃勃的思想。这种思想把爱好进步和正义的各国人民动员起来，在反对压迫和剥削的各条战线上，进行激烈的斗争。”
    塞古联合纺织厂总经理桑巴拉·西索科也讲了话。他指出，同资本主义制度所搞的那一套相反，“中华人民共和国以它的真心的、有效的和大量的援助，出于同帝国主义作斗争的合理考虑，始终竭力使走上发展道路的国家掌握这样的生产手段，以便根据本国的可能自行采取行动，为自己的彻底解放创造条件”。他还赞扬了中国技术人员的谦逊态度。
    中国驻马里大使馆临时代办刘和林为马里纺织工业的诞生向莫迪博·凯塔总统、马里政府和人民表示热烈的祝贺，并对他们支持和关怀中国技术人员的工作表示衷心的感谢。
    莫迪博·凯塔总统为这座工厂的落成剪彩之后，他和刘和林临时代办走进联合纺织厂，首先到施耀康烈士的墓前献了花圈。接着，莫迪博·凯塔总统等在联合纺织厂总经理桑巴拉·西索科和中国技术人员小组组长朱平山的陪同下，参观了这个厂。
