The Liberation Daily of North Kalimantan recently published an editorial calling on members of the North Kalimantan National Liberation Alliance to use Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war to ultimately overthrow the puppet regime of "Malaysia," a product of the neo-colonialism of American and British imperialism.

The editorial states: "We know that Chairman Mao's great thoughts on people's war are the only truth for the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries in their national liberation movements. By mastering Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war, the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries can use people's war to overthrow reactionary rule and establish people's power."

The editorial says that the North Kalimantan National Liberation Alliance has actively carried out a series of preparations to launch people's war across the country, with the most important being the preparation of "people." The North Kalimantan National Liberation Alliance deeply understands that our revolution is the revolution of the broad masses of oppressed and exploited people, not something that a few individuals can replace. It also knows that it must rely on the main force of the revolution—the peasant masses. Therefore, the North Kalimantan National Liberation Alliance has organized and educated the masses on a large scale in various parts of the country and in the border areas.

The editorial says: "Currently, our revolutionary war in the border areas, although on a small scale, will certainly develop as long as it is a people's war."

The editorial calls on members of the North Kalimantan National Liberation Alliance to raise high the red flag of Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war, take root among the masses, and persist in long-term, arduous mass work. It urges them to strive to launch people's war across the country. "Let the British bandits and the 'Malaysia' reactionaries tremble before the people's war of North Kalimantan!"

　　北加里曼丹《解放报》号召民族解放同盟成员扎根群众中
　　运用毛主席人民战争思想推翻反动统治
    新华社七日讯　古晋消息：北加里曼丹《解放报》不久以前发表社论，号召北加里曼丹民族解放同盟成员，运用毛主席关于人民战争的思想，用人民战争最后推翻美、英帝国主义的新殖民主义产物“马来西亚”傀儡政权。
    社论说：“我们知道，毛主席关于人民战争的伟大思想，是殖民地半殖民地人民进行民族解放运动唯一的真理。掌握了毛主席的人民战争思想，殖民地半殖民地人民就能够用人民战争去打倒反动统治，建立人民政权。”
    社论说，北加里曼丹民族解放同盟为在全国各地开展人民战争，积极地进行了一系列的准备工作，其中最重要的就是“人”的准备工作。北加里曼丹民族解放同盟深深懂得，我们的革命是广大被压迫被剥削人民自己的革命，不是少数人所能代替的，并且深知要依靠革命的主力军——农民群众。因此，北加里曼丹民族解放同盟在全国各地，在边区，大规模地组织群众，教育群众。
    社论说：目前，我们在边区的革命战争，虽然规模还小，但是，只要是人民战争，就必然要发展起来。
    社论号召北加里曼丹民族解放同盟成员高举毛主席人民战争思想红旗，扎根于群众之中，坚持长期艰苦的群众工作，为在全国各地开展人民战争而努力奋斗。“让英国强盗和‘马来西亚’反动派在北加里曼丹人民战争的面前发抖吧！”
