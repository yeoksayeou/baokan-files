Declaration in Support of the French Workers' and Students' Revolutionary Struggle

As the political and economic crises of the entire capitalist world, led by U.S. imperialism, accelerate, a magnificent student movement and workers' movement is surging in France and other countries in North America and Europe. In recent days, the broad masses of French youth have taken to the streets, holding high the banner of revolution, going on strike, demonstrating, occupying schools, and fiercely attacking the decadent bourgeois educational system, bravely fighting against the French reactionaries. The broad masses of workers have broken through numerous obstacles, occupied numerous factories and mines, and launched a storm of political and economic strikes. In the face of the people's struggle, the reactionaries of various countries are in chaos, and the revisionists of various countries are in a state of panic and disarray.

The workers' movement and student movement in France are unprecedented in scale and power since the Second World War. They are like the surging waves of the sea, fiercely assaulting the decaying capitalist society.

The just struggle of the French workers and students shows that the French people are increasingly awakening, and revolutionary forces are growing stronger, heralding the arrival of a great revolutionary storm to overthrow the rule of monopoly capitalism. This struggle has given great encouragement to the revolutionary people of the world, especially the proletariat and the broad working people of Europe, North America, and Oceania. We, the working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, and Red Guards of the capital of China, firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the French workers and students. We firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the workers and students of all countries in North America and Europe. We firmly support the revolutionary struggle of all oppressed peoples and nations against imperialism and revisionism in all countries of the world.

Paris and Beijing, though separated by thousands of miles, are closely connected in the struggle of the French people. We are deeply moved as we watch every revolutionary action of the French working class and youth. We are genuinely happy for every victory achieved by the French workers and students. No matter what storms and difficulties the French people encounter on the road of revolutionary struggle, we will always stand by the French working class and youth, forever united with the French people.

The struggle of the French workers and students is not accidental. It is the inevitable result of the development of contradictions within the capitalist system led by U.S. imperialism. In France, as in other capitalist countries in North America and Europe, there are serious political and economic crises. The monopoly bourgeoisie is more ruthlessly oppressing and exploiting the workers, and the working people are becoming more impoverished. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Where there is oppression, there is resistance." The revolutionary struggle of the French people is completely inevitable, as is the revolutionary struggle of the people of all capitalist countries led by U.S. imperialism, and the revolutionary struggle of the people in countries controlled by the traitorous modern revisionist clique.

Now, the French reactionaries are using both violent suppression and political deception to counter the struggle of the French workers and students. The traitorous modern revisionists and Social Democrats are also aiding the tiger, using every means to deceive and sabotage. However, the revolutionary fire of the French people is indomitable. It will burn more fiercely, becoming a raging inferno.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no great power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." This is an unshakable truth. Lenin said long ago: "Imperialism is the dying capitalism transitioning to socialism." Comrade Mao Zedong said: "It can be affirmed that the thorough collapse of imperialism, colonialism, and all exploitative systems, and the thorough liberation of all oppressed peoples and nations, is not far off." The current era is one where imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is advancing towards global victory. Under this great revolutionary situation, the student movement combined with the workers' movement in France will surely lead the revolutionary struggle to deeper and broader levels, creating a new situation. We are fully confident that the French working class and laboring people, with their glorious revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune, and the working class and laboring people of other North American and European countries in the heart of the capitalist world, will surely combine their struggles with the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, forming a surging revolutionary torrent. They will thoroughly smash the evil capitalist system and bury all the imperialists, modern revisionists, and all the devils that eat people.

Workers of the world, unite!
Workers of the world and all oppressed peoples and nations, unite!
Firmly support the just struggle of the Paris workers and students!
Firmly support the struggle of the French revolutionary people!
Firmly support the just struggle of the workers and students of Europe, America, and Oceania!
Firmly support the liberation struggle of all oppressed peoples and nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America!
Firmly support the just war of the great Vietnamese people against U.S. aggression and for national salvation!
Firmly oppose the French reactionaries' suppression of workers, students, and all revolutionary people!
Down with U.S. imperialism!
Down with Soviet revisionism!
Long live the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune!
Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!

    坚决支持法国工人和学生革命斗争的声明
    当以美帝国主义为首的整个资本主义世界的政治危机和经济危机加速发展的时候，一个波澜壮阔的学生运动和工人运动正在法国以及北美、欧洲的其他国家蓬勃兴起。连日来，法国广大的青年学生高举革命大旗，走上街头，罢课示威，占领学校，大造腐朽的资产阶级教育制度的反，同法国反动派进行英勇的斗争；广大的工人冲破重重阻力，占领了大批工厂、矿山，掀起了政治和经济大罢工的怒潮。在人民的斗争面前，各国反动派一片混乱，各国修正主义者手忙足乱，惊恐万状。
    法国的工人运动和学生运动，其声势之浩大，威力之猛烈，是第二次世界大战以来所没有的。它象大海的怒涛，猛烈地冲击着腐朽的资本主义社会。
    法国工人和学生的正义斗争，表明法国人民正在日益觉醒，革命力量正在日益壮大，预示着推翻垄断资本主义统治的伟大革命风暴的来临。这场斗争，给予全世界革命人民特别是欧洲、北美、大洋洲的无产阶级和广大劳动人民以巨大的鼓舞。我们，中国首都的工人阶级、贫下中农和红卫兵，对法国工人和学生的革命斗争表示最坚决的支持，对北美、欧洲一切国家的工人和学生的革命斗争，对全世界各国一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族反对帝国主义和修正主义的革命斗争，表示最坚决的支持。
    巴黎和北京，虽然远隔万水千山，但是，法国人民的斗争同我们息息相通。我们怀着激动的心情，注视着法国工人阶级和青年学生的每一个革命行动。我们为法国工人和学生所取得的每一个胜利而感到由衷的高兴。不管法国人民在革命斗争的道路上遇到怎样的狂风暴雨和艰难曲折，我们始终站在法国工人阶级和青年学生一边，永远同法国人民心连心。
    法国工人和学生的斗争决不是偶然的。它是以美帝国主义为首的整个资本主义制度内部矛盾发展的必然结果。在法国，正同北美、欧洲的其他资本主义国家一样，面临着严重的政治危机和经济危机，垄断资产阶级更加残酷地压迫和剥削工人，劳动人民更加贫困。我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗”。法国人民的革命斗争是完全不可避免的，以美帝国主义为首的资本主义各国人民的革命斗争是完全不可避免的，在修正主义叛徒集团控制下的国家的人民的革命斗争是完全不可避免的。
    现在，法国反动派正在交替地使用暴力镇压和政治欺骗的反革命两手对付法国工人和学生的斗争；无产阶级的可耻叛徒现代修正主义者和社会民主党人也为虎作伥，千方百计地进行欺骗和破坏。但是，法国人民革命斗争的烈火是扑不灭的。
    它将越烧越旺，成为烈焰腾空的燎原大火。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”这是一条颠扑不破的真理。列宁早就说过：“帝国主义是过渡到社会主义去的垂死的资本主义”。毛泽东同志说：“可以肯定，殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃，世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的彻底翻身，已经为期不远了。”当今的时代是帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利的新时代。在这个大好的革命形势下，法国学生运动同工人运动相结合，必将把革命斗争引向更深入更广阔的方面，出现新的局势。我们完全相信，有着巴黎公社光荣革命传统的法国工人阶级和劳动人民，处在资本主义世界心脏地区的其他北美、欧洲国家的工人阶级和劳动人民，一定会把自己的斗争同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的革命斗争结合起来，汇成一股汹涌澎湃的革命洪流，彻底摧毁罪恶的资本主义制度，把帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切吃人的魔鬼统统葬入坟墓。
    全世界无产者，联合起来！
    全世界无产者和一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族联合起来！
    坚决支持巴黎工人、学生的正义斗争！
    坚决支持法国革命人民的斗争！
    坚决支持欧洲、美洲、大洋洲工人、学生的正义斗争！
    坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的解放斗争！
    坚决支持伟大的越南人民抗美救国的正义战争！
    坚决反对法国反动派镇压工人、学生和一切革命人民！
    打倒美帝国主义！
    打倒苏修！
    伟大的巴黎公社革命传统万岁！
    战无不胜的马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！
