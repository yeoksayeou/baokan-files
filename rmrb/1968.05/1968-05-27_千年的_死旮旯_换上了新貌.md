In the remote highlands beyond the Great Wall, nestled in a valley at the foot of the ancient Great Wall, lies a small village named Luquandiao. It has 25 households and 107 people. Surrounded by mountains on three sides and a river on one, the village is isolated and inaccessible. In the past, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the county committee of Wanhua blocked it, making the political atmosphere thin. It was long known as a "dead end."

A thunderous clap opens the new world, and a million-mile eastern wind sweeps away the remnants of the clouds. The mighty wind of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has blown into Luquandiao, stirring up the "dead end." With the help of the People's Liberation Army's agricultural support personnel, the small village of Luquandiao launched a revolutionary criticism campaign and established various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

The mud walls of the village are covered with large characters reading "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Down with China's Khrushchev!" Every household hangs a portrait of Chairman Mao, and everyone reads Chairman Mao's books. As soon as the sun rises, the small valley comes to life. The song "The East Is Red" echoes everywhere, and the voices reading Chairman Mao's quotations grow louder and louder. At night, people gather around kerosene lamps, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, criticizing and repudiating revisionism, and criticizing China's Khrushchev.

An old peasant named An Guihua, over fifty years old, used to be reluctant to let her husband be a livestock keeper, fearing that if the livestock died, she would be criticized by others. After the family of five established a Mao Zedong Thought study class, An Guihua learned the brilliant "Three Articles" and began to struggle with her thoughts. The more she pondered, the more she felt her thoughts were wrong. At a meeting to criticize and repudiate revisionism, An Guihua exposed her private thoughts and asked for help. Her youngest son and two daughters spoke first. They sharply pointed out: "Mother doesn't want Father to be a livestock keeper, which means she has been poisoned by China's Khrushchev." Her husband, Zhao Wanfu, added: "Think about it, if we poor and lower-middle peasants don't care about collective affairs and only look at the tip of our noses, thinking only of ourselves, wouldn't we be fooled by China's Khrushchev?" Through study, An Guihua cast out the "self" from her mind. Now, she not only actively helps her husband take care of the livestock but also proactively helps other community members solve problems and improve collective production.

In the study classes, everyone seriously studies and applies Chairman Mao's works. After the girls of Luquandiao learned Chairman Mao's teachings on "grasp revolution, promote production," nine young women decided to bring irrigation to the small valley and achieve high grain yields. They fiercely struggled against the "difficult" and "fearful" thoughts in their minds. Under the guidance of two old farmers, they braved temperatures of minus twenty degrees, drilling wells, loading explosives, blasting rocks, and digging soil. They dug the first large well on a small slope, creating the first 50 acres of irrigated fields in the vast mountainous area within a radius of several dozen miles. The county revolutionary committee commended them and called on everyone to learn from them. Everyone said: Luquandiao has transformed from a "dead end" to a "red valley." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Luquandiao said: It is the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, that has changed the old face of Luquandiao.

    千年的“死旮旯”换上了新貌
    在塞外高原，古长城脚下的山谷深处，有一个名叫罗全洼的小山村，二十五户人家，一百零七口人。这里三面环山，一面临河，地势偏僻，交通不便，加上过去万全县委内一小撮走资派的封锁，政治空气淡薄，一直被人称为“死旮旯”。
    千钧霹雳开新宇，万里东风扫残云。无产阶级文化大革命的浩荡东风，吹到了罗全洼，“死旮旯”沸腾起来了。在解放军支农人员的帮助下，小小的罗全洼开展了革命大批判，办起了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。
    村子里的土墙上，刷满了一条条“毛主席万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”的大字标语。家家挂起毛主席像，人人都读毛主席的书。每天天一亮，小山沟就沸腾起来了，《东方红》的歌声在四处回响，朗读毛主席语录的声音，一浪高过一浪；夜晚，人们围坐在煤油灯下，活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，批判中国赫鲁晓夫。
    五十多岁的贫农社员安桂花大娘，过去总不愿老伴当饲养员，怕掉了驹遭别人数落。全家五口人办起毛泽东思想学习班以后，安大娘学了光辉的“老三篇”，思想就斗争开了。她越琢磨越觉得自己的思想不对头，在斗私批修讲用会上，安大娘就把自己的私心杂念亮了出来，请大家帮助。她的小儿子和两个闺女首先发言。他们尖锐地指出：“妈妈不让爸爸当饲养员，是中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒。”她的老伴赵万富接着说：“你想一想，要是咱贫下中农不热心集体的事，眼睛只看到鼻子尖上，光顾自己，那不就上了中国赫鲁晓夫的当了？”通过学习，安大娘斗掉了自己头脑里的“私”字。现在，她不仅积极帮助老伴喂好牲口，而且还主动帮助其他社员解决困难，搞好集体生产。
    在学习班里，大家都认真地活学活用毛主席著作。罗全洼的姑娘们学习了毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的教导之后，九个年青的姑娘，决心让小山沟出现水浇田，实现粮食高产。她们狠斗自己头脑中的“难”字、“怕”字，在两个老农的指导下，冒着零下二十多度的严寒，自己打眼、装药、放炮，炸石、挖土，在小坡上打出第一眼大井，使方圆几十里的大山区第一次出现了五十亩水浇田。县革命委员会表扬了她们，并号召大家向她们学习。大家都说：罗全洼从“死旮旯”变成“红山洼”。罗全洼的贫下中农说：是毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命使我们罗全洼改变了旧面貌。
