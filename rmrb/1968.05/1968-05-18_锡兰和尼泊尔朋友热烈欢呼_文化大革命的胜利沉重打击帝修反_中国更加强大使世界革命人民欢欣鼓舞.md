	Sri Lankan and Nepalese friends warmly hail the victory of the Cultural Revolution, which deals a heavy blow to imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and the strengthening of China, which delights the revolutionary people of the world.

	NEW DELHI, May 16 (Xinhua) — E. T. Murti, a leader of the Ceylon Workers' Federation, said here today that the great victory of the Chinese people under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has greatly encouraged the workers and people of Ceylon and the whole world, and they regard these victories as their own.

	Murti said that the May 16 Circular issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966 under the personal direction of the greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist, Chairman Mao Zedong, is a document of great historical significance. He said that Chairman Mao has creatively developed Marxism-Leninism. Chairman Mao has solved the problem of carrying the socialist revolution through to the end under the dictatorship of the proletariat both in theory and in practice.

	He said that Chairman Mao relies on and believes in the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and has launched an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, thereby ensuring that China will never change its color.

	Murti said that the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has dealt a heavy blow to imperialism and modern revisionism.

	A female teacher, Liana, wrote to a Xinhua News Agency correspondent saying that Chairman Mao has summed up the historical experience of the international communist movement and put forward the theory, line, policy, and principles of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, thus developing Marxism-Leninism to its highest contemporary level.

	She said in speaking of the great victories achieved in the past two years by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China that this is not only a great victory for the Chinese revolution but also a victory of great historical significance for the world revolutionary movement. She concluded with the slogan: "Long live the greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist, Chairman Mao! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

	KATHMANDU, May 16 (Xinhua) — Nepalese friends warmly praise the great victory achieved by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by our great leader Chairman Mao.

	A friend named Sharta said to a Xinhua News Agency correspondent that the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the great leader Chairman Mao has greatly encouraged and inspired the revolutionary people of the world, while the American imperialists, Soviet modern revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries are trembling with fear at the victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution because they fear the truth. Their slander of the Cultural Revolution has been thoroughly exposed.

	Another friend living in southern Nepal said that Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao has smashed the conspiracy to restore capitalism in China and made China even stronger. This is the greatest joy for the revolutionary people of the world. He also said that Chairman Mao is guiding the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world from victory to victory in their struggle against imperialism headed by the United States and its running dogs and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership.

	A friend living in Kathmandu said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution carried out in China is an unprecedented feat in world history. He pointed out that China has now become the center of the world revolution.
