The great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th Directive" is the great program for our educational revolution. In our military training, we, together with the revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing No. 2 Middle School, have taken class struggle as a core course. We have implemented Chairman Mao's teachings on criticizing the bourgeoisie, purged the poison of the revisionist educational line, and fundamentally changed the phenomenon of school education being detached from proletarian politics, from the workers and peasants, and from reality. The revolutionary teachers and students of the entire school have raised their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, launched a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and promoted the revolutionization of thought.

Revolutionary criticism is the most practical class education

Revolutionary criticism is the most practical class struggle, the most practical education for constantly waging the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads. We have followed Chairman Mao's instructions to "never forget class struggle" and "criticize the bourgeoisie." Since the beginning of our military training, we have mobilized the revolutionary teachers and students to closely combine with the actual situation of our school and carry out deep and sustained revolutionary criticism.

As soon as we entered the school, we focused on criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, mobilizing the revolutionary teachers and students of the entire school to expose, denounce, and criticize the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in promoting this reactionary line. This helped everyone distinguish between friends and enemies, raised awareness of the struggle between the two lines, and quickly achieved revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, forming a powerful force united against the enemy. Immediately afterward, we, together with the revolutionary teachers and students, launched a fierce attack on the revisionist educational line. At that time, the resumption of classes and revolution had just begun. A few students, influenced by the anarchist trends in society, came and went as they pleased, affecting the resumption of classes and revolution. In response to this situation, while conducting positive education, we organized the revolutionary teachers and students to expose, denounce, and criticize the revisionist educational line. Everyone studied Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on educational revolution, exposed the conspiracy of the Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism, laid bare the crimes of the revisionist educational line, dug out the roots of the revisionist educational line's poison, and discussed their great responsibilities in the proletarian educational revolution.

Through deep revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary teachers and students saw clearly that the Chinese Khrushchev's promotion of the "academics first, grades determine everything" revisionist educational line was a sinister plot to use "name and profit" as bait, to instill bourgeois ideological poison into the younger generation, and to attempt to cultivate revisionist successors, preparing conditions for the restoration of capitalism. They further realized that carrying out the educational revolution is a life-and-death class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie on the educational front; while implementing the resumption of classes and revolution is a prerequisite for carrying out the educational revolution. Only by insisting on the resumption of classes and revolution, and in teaching practice, criticizing while reforming, can the educational revolution be carried through to the end. They also exposed the bad leaders in the school who sabotaged the resumption of classes and revolution, making everyone further realize that the class enemy used anarchist trends to interfere with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, sabotage the resumption of classes and revolution, and make a desperate struggle. Therefore, we must not be fooled by the class enemy, and we must not let the class enemy's plot succeed. The revolutionary teachers and students focused their efforts on the resumption of classes and revolution, continuing to carry out deep revolutionary criticism. The entire school held six sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, closely combining the struggle against selfishness with the criticism of revisionism. The more they criticized, the higher their spirits soared, the redder their thoughts became, and the more determined they were to follow the brilliant course indicated by the "May 7th Directive" and turn the school into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

Regularly recalling bitterness and sweetness is an effective form of class education

Vice Chairman Lin instructed: "If you do not understand what class is, do not understand what exploitation is, you do not understand revolution." Therefore, in the process of criticizing the bourgeoisie, it is necessary to arm the revolutionary teachers and students with Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle. We believe that regularly conducting class education by recalling bitterness and sweetness is an effective method. We, together with the revolutionary committee of the school, often use the methods of inviting in and going out to invite active elements from the PLA who study and apply Chairman Mao's works, workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and parents of students to recall and compare with the revolutionary teachers and students, or organize the revolutionary teachers and students to go out to visit the poor and inquire about their hardships. The students of the Third Platoon, Third Squad often recall bitterness and sweetness with questions. They have held eight recalling bitterness and sweetness meetings and have eaten bitter meals. During the Spring Festival, they first recalled bitterness in the school, then took the bitter meal home, and compared it with the food they now eat at home, and the whole family conducted recalling bitterness and sweetness. Many parents said with tears in their eyes: "This is not just two different kinds of food, but a comparison between the old and new societies." Regular class education has fundamentally changed the students' spiritual appearance. Their proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao have become deeper, and their awareness of implementing Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" has become higher. Revolutionary teachers and students said: "Recall the bitterness of the old society once, talk about the sweetness of the new society once, study Chairman Mao's works once, struggle against selfishness once. The more we recall, the clearer the direction of progress becomes; the more we recall, the deeper our loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian feelings becomes." Through the recalling bitterness and sweetness activities, the revolutionary teachers and students' proletarian awareness has been greatly enhanced, and their determination to carry out the educational revolution has been strengthened.

The struggle of the workers and peasants is a good classroom for class education

We have followed Chairman Mao's teachings on "studying Marxism, not only from books, but mainly through class struggle, work practice, and approaching the workers and peasants, can truly learn it," and together with the revolutionary committee, organized the teachers and students to go to the countryside in batches to labor with the poor and lower-middle peasants, study Chairman Mao's works together, recall bitterness and sweetness together, criticize the Chinese Khrushchev together, and hold lectures on applying Chairman Mao's works. Practice has proven that the countryside is the best classroom for class education, with the most teachers, the most lively teaching materials, and the deepest education. Revolutionary teachers and students said: "Previously, watching movies and plays, listening to others recall bitterness, although we knew that landlords exploited peasants, the feeling was not deep. After going to the countryside, we personally participated in the struggle against landlords, saw with our own eyes the houses built by landlords with the blood and sweat of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and the land they exploited from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and heard the poor and lower-middle peasants' denunciations of the cruel oppression by landlords, which we will never forget in our lifetime." These living class educations that cannot be learned from books have made the revolutionary teachers and students further see clearly that the revisionist goods promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev in the countryside and in schools are all for restoring capitalism in China. They all expressed that in the future, they will definitely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, take the road of combining with the workers and peasants, continuously raise their proletarian awareness, carry the proletarian cultural revolution in the school through to the end, and achieve a thorough victory in the proletarian educational revolution.

　　把阶级斗争当作一门主课
　　北京垂杨柳二中军训团
    伟大领袖毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示，是我们进行教育革命的伟大纲领。我们在军训中，和北京垂杨柳二中广大革命师生一起，把阶级斗争当作一门主课，贯彻毛主席关于学生也要批判资产阶级的教导，肃清修正主义教育路线的流毒，从根本上改变学校教育脱离无产阶级政治、脱离工农群众、脱离实际的现象。全校革命师生提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作高潮，促进了思想革命化。
    革命大批判是最现实的阶级教育
    革命大批判是最现实的阶级斗争，是经常进行两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的最现实的教育。我们遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”和“要批判资产阶级”的教导，从军训以来，就发动广大革命师生，紧密结合本校的实际，深入持久地开展了革命大批判。
    我们刚进校，就狠抓对资产阶级反动路线的大批判，发动全校革命师生揭发、控诉和批判中国赫鲁晓夫推行这条反动路线的滔天罪行，使大家分清了敌我，提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟，迅速实现了革命大联合和革命三结合，拧成了一股团结对敌的巨大力量。紧接着，我们和革命师生一起狠批修正主义教育路线。当时复课闹革命刚开始，少数同学由于受社会上无政府主义思潮的影响，想来就来，想走就走，影响了复课闹革命的进行。针对这种情况，我们在进行正面教育的同时，组织革命师生对修正主义教育路线进行大揭发、大控诉、大批判。大家大学毛主席关于教育革命的光辉思想，大揭中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的阴谋，大摆修正主义教育路线的罪行，大挖修正主义教育路线的毒根，大谈自己在无产阶级教育革命中的重大责任。
    通过深入的革命大批判，广大革命师生看清了中国赫鲁晓夫推行“智育第一，分数挂帅”的修正主义教育路线的罪恶阴谋，是以“名利”为诱饵，向青年一代灌输资产阶级思想毒素，妄图培养修正主义接班人，为实行资本主义复辟准备条件。他们进一步认识到，进行教育革命，是在教育战线上无产阶级同资产阶级的一场你死我活的阶级斗争；而实行复课闹革命，则是进行教育革命的前提。只有坚持复课闹革命，在教学实践中，边批判，边改革，才能把教育革命进行到底。他们还揪出了本校破坏复课闹革命的坏头头，使大家进一步体会到，阶级敌人利用无政府主义思潮，干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，破坏复课闹革命，进行垂死挣扎。因此，绝不能上阶级敌人的当，绝不能让阶级敌人的阴谋得逞。广大革命师生集中精力复课闹革命，继续深入开展革命大批判。全校先后办了六期毛泽东思想学习班，把斗私和批修紧密结合起来。大家越批越斗情绪越高，思想越红，决心沿着“五·七”指示的光辉航道，把学校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    经常忆苦思甜是阶级教育的有效形式
    林副主席指示：“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”因此，在批判资产阶级的过程中，必须用毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争的教导武装革命师生。我们认为经常进行忆苦思甜的阶级教育是有效的方法。我们和校革委会一起，经常采用请进来、走出去的办法，请解放军活学活用毛主席著作积极分子、工人、贫下中农、学生家长等和革命师生一起回忆对比，或者组织革命师生到校外访贫问苦。四连三排的同学经常带着问题忆苦思甜。他们先后开了八次忆苦思甜会，同时吃了忆苦饭。过春节时，他们先在学校忆苦，然后，把忆苦饭带到家里去，和家里现在吃的饭摆在一起，全家进行忆苦思甜。许多家长含着热泪说：“这不单是两种不同的饭菜，这是新旧两种不同社会的对比。”经常的阶级教育，使同学们的精神面貌发生了根本的变化。他们对毛主席的无产阶级感情越来越深，执行毛主席“五·七”指示的自觉性越来越高。革命师生说：“忆一次旧社会的苦，谈一次新社会的甜，学习一次毛主席著作，斗一次私心。越忆，前进的方向越明；越忆，忠于毛主席的无产阶级感情越深。”通过忆苦思甜活动，大大提高了革命师生的无产阶级觉悟，加强了进行教育革命的决心。
    工农群众的斗争是阶级教育的好课堂
    我们遵照毛主席关于“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到”的教导，和革委会一起，组织师生分批分期到农村和贫下中农一起劳动，一起学习毛主席著作，一起忆苦思甜，一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫，一起举行活学活用毛主席著作讲用会。实践证明，农村是阶级教育的最好课堂，教员最多，教材最活，受教育最深。革命师生说：“以前看电影看戏，听别人忆苦，虽然知道地主剥削农民，可是感受不深。到农村后，亲身参加了斗争地主分子，亲眼看见了地主用贫下中农的血汗盖起的房子和剥削贫下中农的土地，又听了贫下中农被地主残酷压迫的控诉，一辈子也忘不了。”这些从书本上学不到的活的阶级教育，使革命师生进一步看清了中国赫鲁晓夫在农村和在学校中推行的修正主义黑货，都是为了在中国复辟资本主义。他们纷纷表示，今后要坚决按毛主席的指示办事，走和工农群众相结合的道路，不断提高自己的无产阶级觉悟，把学校的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，夺取无产阶级教育革命的彻底胜利。
