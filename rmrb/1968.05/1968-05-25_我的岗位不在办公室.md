    The original Party branch secretary of Shenyang Agricultural Machinery Parts Factory No. 2, Zheng Yusu, used to be detached from labor and from the masses. During the initial phase of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he carried out the reactionary bourgeois line. After the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team entered the factory, they helped him recognize his mistakes, enabled him to get close to the masses, and correct his errors, thus gaining the understanding of the masses and being elected into the "three-in-one combination" leading group as a member of the Revolutionary Committee.

    Now, Zheng Yusu goes straight to the workshop as soon as he enters the factory each day, puts down his bag, picks up his tools, and starts working alongside the workers. The workers are very pleased to see this. Some comrades think: Old Zheng has become a cadre again, so we should find him an office! Therefore, they allocated him a desk in the office and gave him a lock. Old Zheng took the lock and immediately thought of Chairman Mao's teaching, "Do not be detached from the masses for a single moment," and recalled the lessons of his past mistakes due to being detached from labor and the masses. He promptly returned the lock, saying: "My post is not in the office, but in the workshop. Only by going to the production frontline and participating in labor can I timely discover and solve problems, and implement correct leadership. I cannot let this lock confine me to the office and cut off my contact with the workers again."

    From then on, Zheng Yusu, except for attending meetings to discuss work at the factory headquarters, spends all his time carrying the Little Red Book, going wherever he can labor, and spreading Mao Zedong Thought. He maintains close contact with the worker masses. The masses reflect: "We trust people like Zheng Yusu who are close to our hearts."

    “我的岗位不在办公室”
    沈阳市农机部件二厂原党支部书记郑愚苏，过去脱离了劳动，脱离了群众，在文化大革命运动初期又执行了资产阶级反动路线。解放军毛泽东思想宣传队进厂以后，帮助他认识了错误，深入于群众之中，检查改正了错误，得到了群众的谅解，被选进“三结合”的领导班子，当了革委会委员。
    现在，郑愚苏每天一进厂就直奔车间，放下提兜，操起工具，就和工人一块干起活来。工人们看在眼里，很是满意。有的同志想：老郑重新当了干部，应该给他找个办公地方啊！于是，就在办公室里分给他一张桌子，给了他一把锁头。老郑接过锁头，马上想起了毛主席关于“不要有一时一刻脱离群众”的教导，联想起过去由于脱离劳动、脱离群众犯错误的教训，立即把锁头退了回去。他说：“我的岗位不在办公室，是在车间。只有深入生产第一线参加劳动，才能及时发现问题，解决问题，实行正确的领导。我不能让这把锁头把我锁在办公室，再象过去那样隔断了和工人的联系。”
    从此，郑愚苏除了开会研究工作到厂部以外，成天带着红色宝书，走到哪里，劳动到哪里，把毛泽东思想宣传到哪里，同工人群众保持着密切的联系。群众反映：“我们信得过郑愚苏这样的贴心人。”
