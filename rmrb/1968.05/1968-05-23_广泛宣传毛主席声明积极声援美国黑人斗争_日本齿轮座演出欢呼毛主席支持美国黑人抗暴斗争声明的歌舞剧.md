Japanese drama troupe Hokushinza performs a song and dance drama celebrating Chairman Mao's declaration supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence

According to the Xinhua News Agency in Tokyo on the 22nd, the Japanese revolutionary art troupe Hokushinza has recently created and performed a song and dance drama celebrating Chairman Mao's declaration supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence, which has been warmly welcomed by the Japanese revolutionary masses.

After Chairman Mao's declaration supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence reached Japan, where the anti-American wave was surging, the revolutionary artists of the Hokushinza troupe immediately began studying and discussing it seriously on the train and at their lodgings. The great call issued by Chairman Mao in the declaration, "Workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and all those who want to oppose American imperialism in the world, take action, give strong support to the struggle of American blacks!" greatly encouraged the revolutionary artists of the Hokushinza troupe. They decided to respond to this great call, use art to widely publicize Chairman Mao's declaration to the Japanese people, and actively support the struggle of American blacks against violence.

After a period of enthusiastic and intense rehearsals, the revolutionary artists of the Hokushinza troupe finally premiered this song and dance drama celebrating Chairman Mao's declaration at the celebration of the publication of the new Japanese translation of the first volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in Shimoniwa City on the 18th. When the image of the great leader Chairman Mao appeared on stage and the actors recited the sentences from Chairman Mao's declaration in a loud voice, the entire audience erupted in cheers, and the audience and actors together enthusiastically sang "The East is Red."

At the end of the performance, the actors playing the people of the world's revolution held the red book "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" in their hands and recited in a firm and powerful voice the passage from Chairman Mao's declaration that points out the direction and bright future of the struggle for all revolutionary people in the world: "Let the whole world unite! All the forces that can be united must be united! Let us jointly oppose the common enemy, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys! It is certain that the thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation, and the thorough emancipation of all oppressed peoples and oppressed nations, are not far off." As soon as the recitation ended, the audience inside erupted in thunderous applause that would not stop, and they enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

    广泛宣传毛主席声明积极声援美国黑人斗争
    日本齿轮座演出欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争声明的歌舞剧
    据新华社东京二十二日电  日本革命文艺团体齿轮座剧团，最近创作并演出了欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明的歌舞剧，受到日本革命群众的热烈欢迎。
    在毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的伟大声明传到反美怒潮汹涌澎湃的日本后，齿轮座剧团的革命文艺战士立即在旅途的火车里，在住地，认真地展开了学习和讨论。毛主席在声明中发出的伟大号召：“世界各国的工人、农民、革命知识分子和一切愿意反对美帝国主义的人们，行动起来，给予美国黑人的斗争以强大的声援！”大大地鼓舞了齿轮座剧团的革命文艺战士。他们决心响应这一伟大号召，通过文艺形式，向日本人民广泛宣传毛主席的声明，积极声援美国黑人的抗暴斗争。
    齿轮座剧团的革命文艺战士，经过一段热情而又紧张的排练，终于在下关市革命人民十八日庆祝《毛泽东选集》第一卷日文版新译本发行时，首次演出了这个欢呼毛主席声明的歌舞剧。当剧场上出现伟大领袖毛主席的画像、演员用宏亮的声音朗诵毛主席声明中的语句时，全场一片欢腾，群众和演员一道热情地高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
    剧终时，扮演世界革命人民的演员们手里捧着红色宝书《毛主席语录》，以坚定有力的声音朗诵毛主席在声明中给全世界革命人民指出斗争方向和光辉前景的一段话：“全世界人民更紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻！可以肯定，殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃，世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的彻底翻身，已经为期不远了。”朗诵刚刚结束，场内群众又发出经久不息的暴风雨般的掌声，并热烈高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
