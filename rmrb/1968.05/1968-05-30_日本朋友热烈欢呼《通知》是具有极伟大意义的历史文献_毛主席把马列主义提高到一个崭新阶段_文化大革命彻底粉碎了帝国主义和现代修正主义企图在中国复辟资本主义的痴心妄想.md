Japanese friends have recently issued statements warmly hailing the second anniversary of the issuance of the May 16 Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally directed by Chairman Mao, and pointing out that the great victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has foiled the conspiracy of imperialists and modern revisionists to restore capitalism in China.

	The representative of the Leftist faction of the Fukoka Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, Nakano Reizo, said that the May 16 Circular, personally directed by Chairman Mao, the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, is the programmatic document of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great historic document. He pointed out that the great, wise Chairman Mao has summed up the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat, clearly and profoundly pointing out that class and class struggle still exist in socialist society, and has solved the problem of continuing the revolution under socialist conditions. This is a major issue concerning the future of socialism and the world revolution.

	Nakano said that Chairman Mao is an outstanding great leader. Chairman Mao has creatively, comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism.

	He said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China, having achieved decisive victories, is now heading for complete victory. This revolution has thoroughly smashed the conspiracy and wild dream of imperialists and modern revisionists to restore capitalism in China. Socialist China, which holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, has become a strong revolutionary base for the people of the world, and it is like a beacon, bringing boundless hope to the people of the world.

	Nakano said that Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism of our time, and it is the guiding ideology of the world revolution. We are determined to join with the working class of Japan to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, with unshakable confidence, strive for the completion of the Japanese revolution and the world revolution. We must forever arm ourselves with the highest level of Marxism-Leninism of our time—Mao Zedong Thought—and carry the struggle through to the end.

	Fujisawa Kazuo, chairman of the Fukoka branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), said that the May 16 Circular is a battle cry for the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses to launch an offensive against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. It is a milestone document.

	Fujisawa said that in this great era when imperialism is heading for total collapse and socialism is marching towards world victory, the Japanese people must, in the course of struggle, strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, further strengthen the fighting friendship between the peoples of Japan and China, and struggle to abolish the Japan-U.S. "security treaty."

	Ishibashi Hiroshi, an electric power worker from Toyama Prefecture, pointed out that the Chinese revolutionary people, inspired by the May 16 Circular, have fully exposed and struck at the treacherous deeds of modern revisionism in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, giving boundless inspiration to revolutionary people all over the world. He said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, has made China the most reliable revolutionary base for the people of the world.

	Japanese railway workers Hiroya Hiroshi and Nishimura Kazuo, and revolutionary youth Takagi, have successively issued statements praising the brilliant victories achieved in China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Shimizu Masao, director of the Matsuyama Ballet Troupe, said that the May 16 Circular, this great historic document, is Chairman Mao's great declaration of struggle against the "representatives of the bourgeoisie who have sneaked into the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles." He said that the Chinese people, following Chairman Mao's instructions, are continuing the revolution and fighting against class enemies under socialist conditions, which is the guarantee that socialist China will never change color. Shimizu pointed out that the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has shattered the dream of imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries to restore capitalism in China.

	Shimizu said that the revolutionary cultural workers in China, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have made great efforts to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art and to smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art, which has given great encouragement to progressive cultural workers in Japan. He warmly praised the revolutionary model operas created by Chinese revolutionary cultural workers under the direct guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing.

	Kojima Masami, vice-president of Yamaguchi University, said that the May 16 Circular, this great document personally directed by Chairman Mao, has written a new revolutionary chapter in world history. He pointed out that the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has greatly inspired the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. This great revolution will forever shine brilliantly in human history.

	Kojima said that Chairman Mao has solved the most important problem of how the proletariat, after seizing power, can successfully reach communism, thus raising Marxism-Leninism to a new stage and opening a new era for Marxism-Leninism.

	He said that Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have greatly enriched the Marxism-Leninism on the theory of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. This series of latest instructions not only inspire the Chinese people but also inspire the revolutionary people of the world.

	Ota Jun, a professor at Tojo University who recently returned from a visit to China, said that Chairman Mao is the greatest genius of our time. Only Chairman Mao has such great ambition and genius to initiate and lead this unprecedented great revolution in a country with one-fourth of the world's population.

	Nakamura Kuichiro, a professor at Osaka University of Economics, said that the May 16 Circular is a historic document of extremely great significance.

	He said that the great leader Chairman Mao has wisely pointed out the path of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism. This is not only a great contribution to the Chinese revolution but also a great contribution to the world revolution.

	Nakamura said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has dealt a heavy blow to imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries.

	Nakamura said that in the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people, it is necessary to take the great Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, and only in this way can the Japanese revolution achieve victory.
