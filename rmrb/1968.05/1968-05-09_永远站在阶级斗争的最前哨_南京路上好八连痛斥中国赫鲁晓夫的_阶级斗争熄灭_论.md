The current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the nation is excellent and getting better by the day. However, as the revolution approaches total victory, the counter-revolutionary forces will inevitably make a desperate struggle. The struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads will become more complex and profound. Led by China’s Khrushchev, a small group of stubborn revisionists, as well as traitors, spies, and landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, are not willing to accept their defeat. They are stirring up a wave of rightist revisionism, attempting to stage a comeback and restore the old system. Towards the class enemy, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat must not be soft-hearted; we must launch a proactive and sustained offensive, thoroughly criticizing them politically, ideologically, and theoretically. Nanjing Road’s Eighth Company, a combat unit that is unwaveringly loyal to Chairman Mao in the storm of class struggle, recently held a series of criticism meetings, launching a fierce attack on China’s Khrushchev’s “class struggle extinction” theory.

Forgetting class struggle is like sleeping with your head on the enemy’s guillotine

Is there class struggle under socialist conditions?

Great Leader Chairman Mao has wisely pointed out that after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, “class struggle has not ended. The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between various political forces, and the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological sphere will continue for a long time, be tortuous, and sometimes even very intense.” China’s Khrushchev, however, sings a different tune, claiming that “class struggle has basically ended” and “the question of whether socialism or capitalism will prevail in our country has already been resolved.” The soldiers of the Eighth Company unanimously criticized this fallacy.

Everyone pointed out: After the proletariat seizes political power, for a long period of history, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the struggle between socialism and capitalism will still exist. Our company has grown up in the storm of class struggle, and the soldiers are witnesses to class struggle under the socialist system.

Nineteen years ago, the company came from the smoke-filled battlefield to the brightly lit Nanjing Road. At that time, Shanghai had been liberated, but a small number of spies and other counter-revolutionaries had gone underground. The reactionary influence of imperialism, the ugly thoughts of the bourgeoisie, and the decadent lifestyle remained in Shanghai, a place that had long been invaded by imperialism and was the most concentrated area of the bourgeoisie. Over the past decade, the company has been guarding Nanjing Road. In which year, on which day, has the enemy not attempted to disintegrate us politically, ideologically, and in terms of lifestyle? In which year, on which day, have we not been vigilant and fought back against the enemy?

The current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has further proven that the struggle between the two classes under the socialist system has not “ended” but is currently engaged in a life-and-death struggle. Great Leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: “The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions. It is a continuation of the long struggle between the Communist Party of China and the broad revolutionary masses under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries, a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.” The soldiers all use Chairman Mao’s latest instructions as a weapon, fiercely criticizing China’s Khrushchev.

Political instructor Wang Chuanyou and soldier Wang Gentu both said: The Communist Party has been fighting the Kuomintang reactionaries for decades. Although the Kuomintang bandits have long been defeated and fled to Taiwan, those spies, traitors, and counter-revolutionaries have not left; they have gone underground, sharpening their knives at all times. The small group of revisionists within the party even more represents the interests of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, representing the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries. They are all remnants of the Kuomintang, and China’s Khrushchev is their chief representative. Therefore, the struggle between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, has never stopped. Chairman Mao pointed out to us long ago, at the time of the basic victory of the War of Liberation: “We must learn to wage political, economic, and cultural struggles against imperialists, the Kuomintang, and the bourgeoisie in the cities. If we do not pay attention to these issues, do not learn to wage these struggles and achieve victory in them, we will not be able to maintain power, we will not be able to stand firm, and we will fail.” We must follow Chairman Mao’s teachings, dare to struggle and dare to win in this political revolution, thoroughly criticize China’s Khrushchev and the small group of revisionists within the party and their representatives in various places, fight them to the ground and expose them, and root out all hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries.

Medical orderly Chen Shifu, soldier Qian Guoben, and many others deeply felt: In the past, the struggle against armed enemies and class struggle with guns and knives was clear; the struggle against unarmed enemies and class struggle without guns and knives was not so clear. They always thought that fleas could not overturn the quilt, and eels could not cause big waves, that the socialist state was ironclad. Now they realize more and more clearly: Under socialist conditions, class struggle without guns and cannons, if not handled properly, the country will change color. In a socialist society, the most fundamental issue, the issue that affects everything, is still the issue of class struggle; the contradiction and struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie determine and influence our entire social and political life. China’s Khrushchev’s claim that class struggle has “ended” and “extinguished” is completely a lie.

The broad masses of soldiers firmly said: We must never forget class struggle. Forgetting class struggle is like sleeping with your head on the enemy’s guillotine, and you won’t know how your head was cut off. We will not fall for China’s Khrushchev’s tricks, will not become “peace soldiers” or “confused soldiers,” and will definitely stand at the forefront of class struggle, charging into battle to defeat the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes for the proletariat.

We must see clearly, stand firmly, withstand, and be strong in the struggle over the line

The class struggle in socialist society will inevitably be reflected within the Communist Party, and will be prominently and concentratedly manifested as the struggle between the two lines within the party. In criticizing China’s Khrushchev’s “class struggle extinction” theory, the Eighth Company on Nanjing Road emphasized: The bourgeoisie, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the imperialists all understand that to make a socialist country degenerate into a capitalist country, they must first make the Communist Party degenerate into a revisionist party. They will use every means to find their agents within the Communist Party. China’s Khrushchev is the biggest agent of all reactionary classes within our party. He denies class struggle, stands on the side of the reactionary classes, and attacks the proletariat, attempting to restore capitalism. Therefore, the essence of the struggle between the two lines within the party is the question of whether the proletariat or the bourgeoisie will prevail, and whether to follow the socialist road or the capitalist road. Today, we must not discuss class struggle without discussing the struggle between the two lines within the party.

Soldiers Wang Gentu and Wang Chaowen said: China’s Khrushchev advocates that “whether the party’s line is correct or wrong, the party must remain united” and that “there is no need to emphasize struggle,” even slandering the struggle within the party as “deliberately created.” This is sheer nonsense. Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line leads China to socialism and to light; China’s Khrushchev’s reactionary line leads China to capitalism and to darkness. Light and darkness, socialism and capitalism, are incompatible, how can we follow China’s Khrushchev’s words to “talk about unity, harmony, and solidarity”? In the struggle between the two lines, standing on which side is the most important and overriding issue, allowing no hesitation or compromise. Towards China’s Khrushchev and his gang of enemies who wave the red flag to oppose the red flag, we must fight them fiercely and criticize them fiercely, fight them to the ground and expose them, and eliminate their revisionist poison in all aspects.

Deputy company commander Miao Shengyuan and platoon leader Shao Jincheng recalled the company’s growth process and deeply felt: For the troops, is it to emphasize proletarian politics or to emphasize military affairs? This is the focus of the struggle between the two lines. Our company is the battlefield of the intense struggle between the two lines. Chairman Mao teaches us: “Military affairs are only one of the tools to complete political tasks.” Vice Chairman Lin points out: “Our army is an army that serves politics and serves socialism. We must use politics to guide military affairs.” However, the bourgeois command led by China’s Khrushchev peddles the revisionist black goods of “military excellence is political excellence.” In 1963, the company held an “Exhibition on Studying and Applying Chairman Mao’s Works and Carrying Forward the Revolutionary Tradition of Hard Work and Simplicity,” but the ambitious usurper Luo Ruiqing, after seeing it, criticized it, saying, “There is too much of the literary and not enough of the military.” The biggest revisionist in Shanghai, Chen Pisheng, also slandered, saying, “Everywhere is broken and old, everywhere is Chairman Mao’s quotations, where is the Eighth Company’s characteristic?” In 1964, during the company’s mountain training, Luo Ruiqing stirred up the “military competition” wind, desperately using military standards to pressure us, demanding that we complete a year’s military training tasks in one month, saying, “If we don’t bring out more military achievements, we cannot reflect the Eighth Company’s true strength.”

The winds of evil are blowing. The party branch led the entire company to advance against the wind—we must emphasize proletarian politics. Political classes were cut, but we insisted on the daily reading system; there were no lights in the mountains, so we made oil lamps from used ink bottles to insist on studying Chairman Mao’s works; there were no tables, so we lay on the slopes and stone slabs to write our study notes. On the eve of the “military competition,” we did not practice military skills, but studied Chairman Mao’s works. In short, the bourgeois command led by China’s Khrushchev tried every means to make us emphasize military affairs and take the revisionist path, but we insisted on political excellence, ranking first, and firmly following Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line, first achieving a political bullseye, not just a bullseye on the target.

During the criticism meeting, comrades further recounted how the soldiers of the Eighth Company stood firmly and clearly in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, defending Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line.

Squad leader Lü Shuanghu fought on the front line of the “Three Supports and Two Militaries.” His parents fell ill, and a letter from home called him back. Shuanghu firmly said: “The revolutionary workers in the factory are like our parents and siblings. I must fight with them and win with them. If we do not overthrow China’s Khrushchev, we will suffer again; having parents is like not having parents. Defending Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line, the country will not change color, and the people will not return to the miserable life of the old society, this is truly having parents.”

Countless Lü Shuanghus, with their actual actions, strongly criticized China’s Khrushchev: The great Communist Party of China was born, developed, and grew strong in the fire of class struggle, and never forgets class struggle, which means never forgetting the struggle between the two lines within the party. China’s Khrushchev wants us to be blind and deaf in the struggle between the two lines within the party, but that will never happen. We, the children of the workers, peasants, and laborers, in critical moments, will see clearly, stand firmly, withstand, and be strong, fighting for Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line and dying for Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line!

Swear to be the spearhead of the proletarian dictatorship, launching a proactive attack on the class enemy

The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. Under socialist conditions, the core issue of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines is still the issue of power. To seize power and consolidate power, we must strengthen the proletarian dictatorship, “implement dictatorship and suppression against the running dogs of imperialism, namely the landlord class and the bureaucrat bourgeoisie, and those who represent these classes, the Kuomintang reactionaries and their accomplices, and only allow them to behave properly, not allowing them to speak or act recklessly.” This is the fundamental guarantee for the proletariat to defeat the bourgeoisie and achieve socialist victory. However, China’s Khrushchev advocates that class struggle has “basically ended” and that the task of state dictatorship is “decreasing.” This is a deadly poison, attempting to make us disarm and hand over the red power to others. When this matter is mentioned, the comrades of the Eighth Company are filled with indignation, wanting to smash China’s Khrushchev to pieces with their iron fists.

Squad leader Yang Jiping said: Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “Without an army of the people, there is nothing of the people.” The People’s Liberation Army is the pillar of the proletarian dictatorship. We must forever hold our guns, defending the power of the proletariat. China’s Khrushchev wants us to put down our guns, allowing this gang of ghosts and snakes to come out and restore the old system, which is absolutely impossible, ten thousand times impossible.

The soldiers are full of fighting spirit and say: Chairman Mao points out: “The army... is a tool of oppression against the enemy class, it is violence, not ‘benevolence.’” Our company is the spearhead of the proletarian dictatorship. To defend the red power, we will thrust our bayonets wherever needed. We will resolutely follow Chairman Mao’s instructions: “Against the reactionary actions of the reactionaries and reactionary classes, we will not apply benevolent policies!”

Everyone realized in the criticism that the journey of the company is the journey of the spearhead of the proletarian dictatorship launching a proactive attack on the class enemy:

Look, over the past decade, standing guard and patrolling on Nanjing Road is to firmly hold our guns, defending the power seized from the Kuomintang reactionaries. As long as we are here, the red power is here. If the class enemy dares to move a single grain of soil at the foot of the socialist wall, they will come and never return.

Look, during the great “January Revolution,” the company vowed to be a strong backbone for the proletarian revolutionaries. At that time, many old soldiers such as Lu Chonglin and Lu Jinhua all wrote letters of determination, applying to the party branch to extend their service and not retire. They said: “Now the company is standing on the front line of defending the red power. How can we leave the company? We are old soldiers with redder hearts. A red heart beats for defending the red power.”

Political instructor Wang Chuanyou said passionately: Relaxing the proletarian dictatorship is like disarming ourselves and surrendering to the enemy. We will not fall into China’s Khrushchev’s trap. Class struggle is either us making the enemy sleepless or the enemy making us sleepless. The tree wants to be still, but the wind does not stop. This spearhead of the company must grasp the initiative to attack the enemy, launching a fierce and sustained attack on all class enemies.

Under socialist conditions, remembering class struggle is to remember the proletarian dictatorship. The proletarian dictatorship must be strengthened, not weakened. The broad masses of soldiers unanimously pointed out: Strengthening the proletarian dictatorship is to rely on Mao Zedong Thought. Only by arming ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought and leading the company can we know who the spearhead should be aimed at.

Reject corruption, never be tainted, wear straw shoes and trample on ghosts and snakes

The broad masses of soldiers of the Eighth Company further denounced China’s Khrushchev’s “class struggle extinction” theory, pointing out that under socialist conditions, class struggle is very complex. “After the armed enemies are eliminated, the unarmed enemies still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us.” When the enemy fails politically and militarily, they will inevitably open up gaps in life and economy, launching an attack on us. This is a form of class struggle under socialist conditions, and proletarian revolutionary soldiers must never take it lightly.

Soldier Xiao Changbao said: The enemy smiles at you, but hides a thousand knives in the smile. China’s Khrushchev claims that “the revolution is almost done” and “now... we should create conditions to live better,” this is the trick of hiding knives in smiles, we must be very vigilant! We must maintain a firm and correct political direction, and to do so, we must maintain the spirit of hard struggle. Without the spirit of hard struggle, we cannot maintain a firm and correct political direction. The old Red Army of Jinggangshan wore straw shoes, breaking through the heavy encirclement of the Kuomintang reactionaries; the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army wore straw shoes, defeating the Japanese invaders; the People’s Liberation Army wore straw shoes, overthrowing the Chiang Kai-shek regime; the old comrades of our company wore straw shoes, kicking out the gold-digging girls and poisonous winds on Nanjing Road. The more straw shoes we wear, the stronger our feet, the firmer our stance. We will still wear straw shoes now, trampling on China’s Khrushchev and all ghosts and snakes under our feet!

For many years, the party branch of the Eighth Company has consciously passed down the spirit of hard struggle from generation to generation. Every time new soldiers are recruited, they must do the following five firsts: The first gift is to give a red book, a sewing kit, and an envelope made of old newspapers, encouraging soldiers to study Mao Zedong Thought and cultivate the spirit of hard struggle; the first class meeting is to organize the study of “In Memory of Norman Bethune,” encouraging soldiers to be the servants of the people, completely and thoroughly; the first political class is to visit the company’s honor room, learning Chairman Mao’s teachings on “We must always maintain the spirit of modesty, prudence, and not being arrogant or impatient, and we must always maintain the spirit of hard struggle”; the first heart-to-heart talk is for old soldiers to share their experiences of maintaining the spirit of hard struggle; the first experience-sharing meeting is to exchange experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works to maintain the spirit of hard struggle.

The soldiers deeply felt that maintaining the spirit of hard struggle is a process of struggle between the proletarian and bourgeois worldviews, a process of the proletariat and bourgeoisie competing for successors. Platoon leader Shao Jincheng said: If you seek one part in life, you will waver one part in politics. Giving up the struggle between the two lifestyles is giving up the struggle between the two classes in politics. Seeking the bourgeois lifestyle is the evil path of “peaceful evolution” arranged by China’s Khrushchev, which we must never take.

New soldiers Guo Huanzhang, Dai Daxi, Jiang Zhen, and Zhang Dexuan all angrily said: China’s Khrushchev wants to use soft knives to kill people, leading us down the evil path of “peaceful evolution,” which is simply a daydream. We must inherit and carry forward the glorious traditions of the company, saving a grain of rice, a drop of water, a degree of electricity, a cent of money, and an inch of cloth. In the face of the “fragrant wind” and “sugar-coated bullets” of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, we must reject corruption and never be tainted, maintaining the character of the laboring people, making the red socialist state forever unchanged!

The comrades of the Eighth Company further pointed out: We save a grain of rice, a drop of water, a degree of electricity, a cent of money, and an inch of cloth, not only to save resources, not only to inherit glorious traditions, but also to prevent revisionism and consolidate the company’s combat effectiveness in class struggle. This is a major issue of class struggle, not a minor issue of life. Only by not fearing hardship and fatigue in daily life can we not fear pressure, coercion, knives, spears, ghosts, demons, emperors, and thieves in the stormy waves of class struggle.

Forge a loyal heart, carry out the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end

Finally, the soldiers of the Eighth Company on Nanjing Road unanimously pointed out that thoroughly criticizing China’s Khrushchev’s “class struggle extinction” theory, remembering class struggle, involves a thousand and one things, but ultimately, it is to break with selfishness and establish selflessness, firmly grasp the word “loyalty,” and be infinitely loyal to Great Leader Chairman Mao.

Everyone said: We all live in the storm of class struggle. The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in society is reflected in our minds at all times. Everyone’s mind is a battlefield where the two classes and two worldviews compete. To defeat the bourgeoisie in society, we must first defeat bourgeois thoughts in our minds. Chairman Mao teaches us: “The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation.” The worldview issue is the “master switch” of all issues. Opening this “master switch,” people will see clearly.

The soldiers said: The core of the proletarian worldview is “public,” and the core of the bourgeois worldview is “private.” We must open the “public” “master switch,” making the hearts of proletarian revolutionary soldiers bright and clear, leaving no room for “private.” In this way, when we enter the battlefield of class struggle, we will bravely fight the enemy, unburdened.

Platoon leader He Fukuang and clerk Tang Guoxing said: China’s Khrushchev claims “public with private” and “public and private merging,” attempting to deceive us into betraying Chairman Mao and the proletariat, which is a pipe dream! We must let “public” occupy our minds, be “loyal” soldiers of Chairman Mao for life. Loyalty is shown in actions; we must let the fiery class struggle test our actions for life.

Deputy squad leader Wang Jiaoyou said: When I first accepted the “Three Supports and Two Militaries” task, I had a “fear” in my heart, fearing to make mistakes, fearing to damage the company’s honor, making my work timid and unable to take a step. Later, I thought, at this critical moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, the party gave me this task, which is to stand on the front line of defending Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line. Defending Chairman Mao with a “fear” is the biggest private interest, the biggest disloyalty to Chairman Mao, and I cannot do this. From then on, I threw away the “fear” and replaced it with “dare,” daring to fight against wrong things and daring to insist on right things, my red heart forever towards Chairman Mao.

In the great criticism to overthrow and expose China’s Khrushchev, the soldiers of the Eighth Company on Nanjing Road resolutely declared: At this moment when the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines is deepening, to achieve total victory, we must be brave. Bravery comes from “public,” and “public” comes from “loyalty.” To have a heart that is loyal to Great Leader Chairman Mao, we must treat ourselves as objects of the revolution, enter the furnace of class struggle, and undergo countless tempering. We, the proletarian revolutionary soldiers, must forge a heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, daring to struggle on the “main line” of class struggle and the “line” of the struggle over the line, thoroughly overthrowing and exposing China’s Khrushchev and his counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies, carrying out the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end.

专栏：七亿人民都来做批判家

　　永远站在阶级斗争的最前哨
　　——南京路上好八连痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论
    目前，全国无产阶级文化大革命的形势一片大好，越来越好。但是，革命越接近全面胜利，反革命力量必然要作垂死挣扎，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，必然越加复杂，越加深刻。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的一小撮顽固不化的走资派，以及叛徒、特务和地、富、反、坏、右分子，决不甘心于自己的失败。他们正在煽起一阵阵右倾翻案妖风，妄图反攻倒算，实行复辟。对于阶级敌人，无产阶级革命派决不能心慈手软，一定要发起主动的、持久的进攻，把他们从政治上、思想上、理论上批深批透，批倒批臭。南京路上好八连，这个在阶级斗争风浪中无限忠于毛主席的战斗集体，最近连续举行批判会，向中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论猛烈开火。
    忘记阶级斗争，就是把脑袋枕在敌人的铡刀上睡觉
    社会主义条件下，有没有阶级斗争？
    伟大领袖毛主席英明指出，在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，“阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”中国赫鲁晓夫却大唱反调，胡说什么“阶级斗争基本结束”，“我国社会主义和资本主义谁战胜谁的问题，现在已经解决了”。好八连的指战员们一致批判了这种谬论。
    大家指出：无产阶级夺取政权以后，在很长的历史时期内，还存在着无产阶级同资产阶级两个阶级的斗争，还存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争。我们连队就是在阶级斗争的风浪中成长起来的，连队的战士都是社会主义制度下阶级斗争的见证人。
    十九年前，连队从硝烟弥漫的战场，来到灯红酒绿的南京路。当时，上海是解放了，但是一小撮特务和其它反革命分子潜伏下来了，帝国主义的反动影响、资产阶级的丑恶思想和糜烂的生活方式，仍然遗留在上海这个长期受帝国主义侵略的、资产阶级最集中的地方。十几年来，连队守卫在南京路上，敌人哪一年、哪一天不是妄图从政治上、思想上、生活上瓦解我们？我们哪一年、哪一天不是百倍警惕、针锋相对地同敌人进行斗争？
    当前的无产阶级文化大革命，更充分证明社会主义制度下两个阶级的斗争不是“结束”了，而是正在激烈地进行着你死我活的大搏斗。伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”指战员们都以毛主席这一最新指示作为武器，狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫。
    指导员王传友、战士王根土都说：中国共产党同国民党反动派斗争了几十年，现在蒋介石匪帮虽然早已被打败，逃到台湾去了，但是，那些特务、叛徒、反革命分子并没有走，他们潜伏下来，无时无刻不在磨刀；党内一小撮走资派更是代表了资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的利益，代表了国民党反动派的利益。他们都是国民党的余孽，中国赫鲁晓夫就是他们的总代理人。因此，共产党同国民党之间、无产阶级同资产阶级之间的斗争始终没有停止过。毛主席早在解放战争取得基本胜利的时候就向我们指出：“必须学会在城市中向帝国主义者、国民党、资产阶级作政治斗争、经济斗争和文化斗争，……如果我们不去注意这些问题，不去学会同这些人作这些斗争，并在斗争中取得胜利，我们就不能维持政权，我们就会站不住脚，我们就会失败。”我们一定遵照毛主席的教导，在这场政治大革命中敢于斗争，敢于胜利，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在各地的代理人彻底批深批透，斗倒斗臭，把隐藏的叛徒、特务和反革命分子统统挖出来。
    卫生员陈士福、战士钱国本和许多同志都深切体会到：过去对拿枪的敌人、动刀枪的阶级斗争，看得清楚；对不拿枪的敌人、不动刀枪的阶级斗争，就看不大清楚了，总以为跳蚤掀不起被窝，泥鳅翻不起大浪，这社会主义江山是铁打的了。现在才越来越明白：社会主义条件下的阶级斗争，不动枪，不动炮，弄得不好，国家要变颜色。在社会主义社会里，最基本的问题，影响一切的问题，仍然是阶级斗争问题；无产阶级同资产阶级的矛盾和斗争，决定和影响着我们全部社会生活和政治生活。中国赫鲁晓夫胡说阶级斗争“结束”、“熄灭”，完全是骗人的鬼话。
    广大战士坚定地说：千万不能忘记阶级斗争。忘记了阶级斗争，就是把脑袋枕在敌人的铡刀上睡觉，脑袋掉了，还不知是怎么掉的。我们决不上中国赫鲁晓夫的当，决不当“和平兵”、“糊涂兵”，一定要站在阶级斗争的最前哨，为无产阶级战胜资产阶级和一切剥削阶级而冲锋陷阵。
    一定要在路线斗争中看得清、站得稳、顶得住、过得硬
    社会主义社会的阶级斗争，必然反映到共产党内部，突出地、集中地表现为党内两条路线的斗争。南京路上好八连在批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论时强调指出：资产阶级、国民党反动派和帝国主义者都懂得，要使社会主义国家蜕变为资本主义国家，首先要使共产党蜕变为修正主义的党。他们千方百计从共产党内部寻找自己的代理人。中国赫鲁晓夫就是一切反动阶级在我们党内的最大的代理人。他否认阶级斗争，站在反动阶级的立场上，向着无产阶级进攻，妄图复辟资本主义。因此，党内两条路线斗争的实质，就是无产阶级同资产阶级谁战胜谁的问题，就是走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的问题。在今天，决不能离开党内两条路线的斗争，去谈论阶级斗争。
    战士王根土、王超文等都说：中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹什么“无论党的路线正确或错误，党都保持统一”，“没有必要强调斗争”，甚至诬蔑党内斗争是“故意制造”的。这真是一派胡言。毛主席的革命路线把中国引向社会主义，引向光明；中国赫鲁晓夫的反动路线把中国引向资本主义，引向黑暗。光明同黑暗，社会主义同资本主义，这是水火不相容的，怎能照中国赫鲁晓夫所说的那样去“讲统一，讲和气，讲团结”？在两条路线斗争中站在哪一边，是高于一切、统帅一切的头等重要问题，来不得半点含糊，留不得半点余地。对于中国赫鲁晓夫这伙打着“红旗”反红旗的敌人，我们就是要狠狠地斗，狠狠地批，把他们斗倒批臭，肃清他们在各方面的修正主义流毒。
    副连长苗生元、排长邵金城等回顾了连队的成长过程，深有体会地说：就部队来看，突出无产阶级政治，还是突出军事？是两条路线斗争的焦点，我们连队就是两条路线激烈争夺的阵地。毛主席教导我们：“军事只是完成政治任务的工具之一”，林副主席指出：“我们的军队是为政治服务、为社会主义服务的军队，我们要用政治指导军事”。但是以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部却大肆贩卖“军事好就是政治好”的修正主义黑货。一九六三年，连队举办“活学活用毛主席著作和发扬艰苦朴素革命传统展览会”，篡党篡军的大野心家罗瑞卿看后竟大加指责，说什么“文的太多，武的不突出”，上海市最大的走资派陈丕显也诬蔑说：“到处都是破破烂烂，到处都是毛主席语录，哪里有八连的特点？”一九六四年，连队在山区野营，罗瑞卿刮起“大比武”的妖风，拚命用军事指标压我们，要我们一个月内完成一年的军事训练任务，胡说什么“不多拿一点武的出来，就不能反映八连真正过得硬”。
    妖风阵阵。党支部带领全连战士顶风前进——就是要突出无产阶级政治。政治课被砍掉了，我们就坚持天天读的制度；山区没有灯，就用废墨水瓶做成煤油灯，坚持学习毛主席著作；没有桌子，趴在山坡上、石板上写学习心得。在“大比武”前夕，我们不是大练军事技术，而是大学毛主席著作。一句话，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部费尽心机要我们突出军事，走修正主义的邪路，我们就是要政治好，称第一，紧紧跟定毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，首先要政治上的十环，而不是仅仅要靶子上的十环。
    批判会上，同志们进一步叙述了八连战士怎样在无产阶级文化大革命中立场坚定、旗帜鲜明地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    班长吕双虎，奋战在“三支”“两军”第一线。父母病了，家里来信叫他回去。双虎坚定地说：“工厂的革命工人，就是自己的父母兄妹，我一定要和他们战斗在一起，胜利在一起。不打倒中国赫鲁晓夫，我们又要吃二遍苦，有父母等于无父母；保卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，国家不变颜色，人民不回到旧社会的苦难生活中去，这才算真正有了父母”。
    无数个吕双虎，都以实际行动有力地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫：伟大的中国共产党是在阶级斗争的烈火中诞生、发展和壮大的，念念不忘阶级斗争，就要念念不忘党内两条路线的斗争。中国赫鲁晓夫妄想让我们在党内两条路线斗争面前耳目失灵，那永远办不到。我们工农劳动群众的子弟兵，在关键时刻，就是看得清，站得稳，顶得住，过得硬，生为毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死为毛主席的革命路线而献身！
    誓做无产阶级专政的刀尖子，向阶级敌人主动进攻
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。在社会主义条件下，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的核心问题，仍然是政权问题。为了夺取政权，巩固政权，必须加强无产阶级专政，“向着帝国主义的走狗即地主阶级和官僚资产阶级以及代表这些阶级的国民党反动派及其帮凶们实行专政，实行独裁，压迫这些人，只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。”这是无产阶级战胜资产阶级，取得社会主义胜利的根本保证。但是中国赫鲁晓夫却大肆宣扬阶级斗争“基本结束”，国家专政的任务是“愈来愈小了”。这是一剂烈性毒药，妄图让我们解除武装，把红色政权拱手让人。提起这一桩，好八连同志一个个义愤填膺，恨不得抡起铁拳，把中国赫鲁晓夫砸个粉碎。
    班长杨继平说：伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”中国人民解放军是无产阶级专政的柱石，我们要永远紧握手中枪，保卫无产阶级的政权。中国赫鲁晓夫妄想叫我们放下枪杆，让他们这伙牛鬼蛇神一齐跑了出来，翻案复辟，这一千个办不到，一万个办不到。
    战士们斗志昂扬地说：毛主席指出：“军队……对于敌对的阶级，它是压迫的工具，它是暴力，并不是什么‘仁慈’的东西。”我们的连队，就是无产阶级专政的刀尖子，为了保卫红色政权，哪里需要，就刺向哪里。我们坚决按照毛主席的指示办事：“对于反动派和反动阶级的反动行为，决不施仁政”！
    大家在批判中认识到，连队经历的路程，就是无产阶级专政的刀尖子向阶级敌人主动进攻的路程：
    看，十几年来在南京路上站岗放哨，就是紧握手中枪，誓死捍卫从国民党反动派手中夺来的政权。有我们在，就有红色政权在，阶级敌人胆敢在社会主义墙脚上动一点土，管叫他有来无回。
    看，伟大的“一月革命”中，连队誓作无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾。当时许多老战士如陆冲林、陆锦华等，都纷纷写决心书，向党支部申请超期服役，决不退伍回家。他们说：“现在连队正屹立在保卫红色政权的最前线，我们怎能离队？我们兵老心更红，一颗红心，誓为保卫红色政权而跳动。”
    指导员王传友满怀激情地说：放松无产阶级专政，就是自己解除武装，就是向敌人投降。我们决不上中国赫鲁晓夫的圈套。阶级斗争，不是我们把敌人搞得睡不着觉，就是敌人把我们搞得睡不着觉。树欲静而风不止。连队这把刀尖子，一定要掌握向敌人进攻的主动权，主动向一切阶级敌人猛烈地持久地进攻。
    在社会主义条件下，念念不忘阶级斗争，就要念念不忘无产阶级专政。无产阶级专政只许加强，不许削弱。广大指战员一致指出：加强无产阶级专政，就是靠毛泽东思想。只有用毛泽东思想武装头脑，统帅连队，我们才知道刀尖子应该对准谁。
    拒腐蚀，永不沾，穿起草鞋把牛鬼蛇神脚下踩
    好八连的广大战士进一步痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，指出，在社会主义条件下，阶级斗争是十分复杂的。“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争”。当敌人在政治上、军事上失败以后，必然会从生活上、经济上打开缺口，向我们发起进攻。这是社会主义条件下阶级斗争的一种形式，无产阶级革命战士万万不可等闲视之。
    战士肖昌宝说：敌人对你一脸笑，笑里藏着万把刀。中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么“革命是搞得差不多了”，“现在……要创造条件使生活过得更好些”，这就是笑里藏刀的把戏，我们可要千万警惕啊！我们要保持坚定正确的政治方向，就必须保持艰苦奋斗的作风，没有艰苦奋斗的作风，就不能保持坚定正确的政治方向。井冈山的老红军穿草鞋，粉碎了国民党反动派的重重围困；八路军、新四军穿草鞋，打败了日本侵略者；人民解放军穿草鞋，推翻了蒋家王朝；我们连队的老同志穿草鞋，踢开了南京路上的金钱妖女，香风毒雾。越穿草鞋，脚板子越硬，立场越稳。我们现在还要穿草鞋，把中国赫鲁晓夫和一切牛鬼蛇神统统踩在脚下！
    多少年来，八连党支部自觉地使艰苦奋斗的作风代代相传。每当新战士入伍，都要做到五个第一：第一件礼物，赠送红色宝书、针线包和旧报纸糊的信封，勉励战士大学毛泽东思想，大树艰苦奋斗作风；第一次班务会，组织学习《为人民服务》，勉励战士完全、彻底地做人民的勤务员；第一堂政治课，参观连队的荣誉室，学习毛主席“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”的教导；第一次谈心活动，由老战士介绍保持艰苦奋斗作风的体会；第一次讲用会，交流活学活用毛主席著作保持艰苦奋斗作风的经验。
    指战员们深深感到，保持艰苦奋斗作风的过程，是无产阶级同资产阶级两种世界观斗争的过程，是无产阶级同资产阶级争夺接班人的过程。排长邵金城说：生活上有一分追求，政治上便会有一分动摇，放弃生活上两种方式的斗争，就是放弃政治上两个阶级的斗争。追求资产阶级生活方式，这就是中国赫鲁晓夫安排的“和平演变”的邪道，我们万万走不得。
    新战士郭环章、戴大喜、蒋振、张德煊都愤怒地说：中国赫鲁晓夫妄想用软刀子杀人，拉我们走“和平演变”的邪道，简直是白日做梦。我们一定要继承和发扬连队的光荣传统，节约一粒米、一滴水、一度电、一分钱、一寸布，在资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的“香风”、“糖弹”面前，拒腐蚀，永不沾，保持劳动人民的本色，使鲜红鲜红的社会主义江山永不变色！
    八连的同志们进一步指出：我们节约一粒米、一滴水、一度电、一分钱、一寸布，不仅仅是为了节省物资，不仅仅是为了继承光荣传统，而是为了反修防修，为了培养连队在阶级斗争中的战斗力。这是阶级斗争的大事，不是生活小事。只有在平时生活中不怕累，不怕苦，才能在阶级斗争的大风大浪中不怕压、不怕迫、不怕刀、不怕戟、不怕鬼、不怕魅、不怕帝、不怕贼。
    锤炼一片忠心，把无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底
    最后，南京路上好八连的指战员们纷纷指出，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，念念不忘阶级斗争，千头万绪，归根到底，就是要破大私，立大公，狠抓一个“忠”字，无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席。
    大家说：我们都在阶级斗争的风浪中生活，社会上无产阶级同资产阶级的斗争，随时都反映到头脑里来。每个人的头脑，都是两个阶级、两种世界观争夺的战场。我们要在社会上战胜资产阶级，就要首先在头脑里战胜资产阶级思想。毛主席教导我们：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。世界观问题是一切问题的“总开关”，打开这个“总开关”，人们就会心明眼亮。
    战士们说：无产阶级世界观的核心是个“公”字，资产阶级世界观的核心是个“私”字。我们就是要打开“公”字这个“总开关”，把无产阶级革命战士的胸怀照得透亮透亮，叫“私”字无处藏身。这样，我们上了阶级斗争的战场，就能勇敢杀敌，无牵无挂。
    排长何福全、文书唐国兴说：中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么“大公有私”、“公私溶化”，妄图诱骗我们背叛毛主席，背叛无产阶级，那是妄想！我们要让“公”字占领头脑，当一辈子毛主席的“忠”字兵。忠不忠，看行动，我们要一辈子让火热的阶级斗争检验我们的行动。
    副班长王家友说：我开始接受“三支”“两军”任务时，怀里揣着个“怕”字，怕犯错误，怕损害连队荣誉，弄得工作缩手缩脚，迈不开步。后来想到，在这两个阶级决战的关键时刻，党交给我这项任务，就是叫我站在保卫毛主席、保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的前沿阵地上。保卫毛主席而有“怕”字，就是最大的私心，就是对毛主席的最大的不忠，我决不能这样做。从此我丢掉怕字，换上敢字，对错误的东西敢于斗争，对正确的东西敢于坚持，红心永向毛主席。
    在批倒批臭中国赫鲁晓夫的革命大批判中，南京路上好八连的指战员们坚决表示：在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争越加深入的时刻，要夺取全面胜利，就要勇敢。勇字从公字来，公字从忠字来，要有一颗忠于伟大领袖毛主席的红心，就要把自己当作革命的对象，投入阶级斗争的熔炉，经受千锤百炼。我们无产阶级革命战士，就是要锤炼一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，敢于在阶级斗争的“纲”上、在路线斗争的“线”上摸爬滚打，把中国赫鲁晓夫和他的反革命修正主义谬论彻底斗倒批臭，把无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底。
