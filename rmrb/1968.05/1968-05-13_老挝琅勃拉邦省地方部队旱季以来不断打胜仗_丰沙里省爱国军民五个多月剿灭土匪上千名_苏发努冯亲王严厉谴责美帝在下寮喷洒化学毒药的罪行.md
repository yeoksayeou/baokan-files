According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Kheang Khay, the local armed forces in Luang Prabang Province, Laos, since the beginning of the 1967-1968 dry season, have not only cooperated with the main forces in many major battles but have also taken the initiative to attack the enemy. They have eliminated 706 enemy personnel, blown up one enemy bridge, sunk six enemy boats, and seized a large amount of weapons and military supplies.

The victories of the local armed forces in Luang Prabang Province have made important contributions to crushing the enemy's "gradual encroachment" attacks and recovering many areas previously occupied by the enemy.

According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station, the patriotic military and civilians in Phongsaly Province, Laos, from November 11, 1967, to April 25, 1968, continuously attacked the enemy in areas such as Ou Dai and Ou Nua. They have annihilated and disbanded over 1,070 bandits trained by U.S. imperialism, including the complete annihilation of one enemy battalion, and seized a large amount of military supplies.

According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Kheang Khay, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, led by Prince Souphanouvong, recently sent a telegram to Prince Souvanna Phouma. The telegram, on behalf of the Lao Patriotic Front, strongly condemns the crime of U.S. imperialism spraying chemical poisons in southern Laos, killing the Lao people.

The telegram recounts how U.S. aircraft recently sprayed poisons in areas such as Savannakhet Province and Xekong Province, causing serious losses to the lives and property of the local people.

The telegram states that U.S. imperialism must bear full responsibility for this crime and must immediately stop interfering with and invading Laos and all barbaric acts.

The telegram points out that Prince Souvanna Phouma must also be held responsible for indulging in the crimes of U.S. imperialism.

According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station on May 3, the Lao Patriotic Front's representatives in Vientiane, Tao Su and Phoumi Vongvichit, on April 23, handed a letter to the Vientiane authorities. The letter strongly protests the recent actions of the Vientiane authorities allowing Indian and Canadian representatives of the International Control Commission to go to Saravane, Xekong, and the Mekong River to conduct so-called "investigations" of the military situation.

In the letter, Tao Su and Phoumi Vongvichit questioned the Vientiane authorities, asking on what grounds, as one of the three sides in the National Unity Government of Laos, they have the right to use the name of the National Unity Government to allow the International Control Commission to conduct "investigations."

Tao Su and Phoumi Vongvichit also condemned the illegal activities of the Indian and Canadian representatives who went to Saravane, Xekong, and the Mekong River on April 12 to conduct so-called "investigations."

    电报追述了美国飞机最近接连在沙湾拿吉省和阿速坡省等地喷洒毒品，使当地人民生命财产造成严重损失的罪恶行径。
    电报说，美帝国主义必须对这一罪行承担全部责任，美帝国主义要立即停止对老挝人民的干涉和侵略以及一切野蛮罪行。
    电报指出，富马也必须对纵容美帝国主义的罪行负责。

    陶苏、培拉西在信中责问万象当局，它作为老挝三方面民族团结政府的一方，有什么权力盗用民族团结政府的名义让国际委员会去进行“调查”活动？
    陶苏、培拉西在信中还谴责了印度、加拿大代表四月十二日去沙拉湾、阿速坡和寮岸进行所谓“调查”的非法活动。
