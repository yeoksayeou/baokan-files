The revolutionary workers of the Shuangyashan Coal Mine, one of the key coal mines in Heilongjiang Province, regard producing one more ton of coal as an act of paying more loyalty to Great Leader Chairman Mao and as a powerful strike against class enemies. The revolution is booming, and production is thriving. The production plan for the first four months of this year was exceeded every month. Since May, an unprecedentedly good situation has emerged.

During the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary awareness of the broad masses of workers in the Shuangyashan Mine Area has greatly increased. They regard implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" as an important sign of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They think about and strive for revolutionary action and production promotion. They pour their sincere loyalty to Chairman Mao and the boundless enthusiasm ignited during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into practical actions of revolutionary action and production promotion. The broad masses of revolutionary workers, with a strong sense of responsibility as masters of the state, firmly guard their production and work posts, voluntarily observe and maintain proletarian revolutionary discipline, and have completed various tasks well. For a period, the East Pit of the Sifangtai Mine had poor production conditions and was short of nearly 2,000 tons of coal. At that time, some comrades said, "We can make it up next month." However, the majority of miners disagreed. Everyone, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," worked hard, overcame all difficulties, made up for the shortfall, and exceeded the state plan for that month. A mining team in the Baoshan Mine firmly implemented Chairman Mao's instruction to "be thrifty and make revolution," spending a full eleven hours to carefully extract twelve support pillars buried in the working face.

With the help of the People's Liberation Army's left-supporting troops, the broad masses of revolutionary workers in the Shuangyashan Coal Mine, through the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, deeply understood that implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" is a sharp class struggle. A handful of class enemies, in order to save themselves from doom, resort to various tricks and schemes, attempting to sabotage production and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. On one day in April, an old worker from a poor peasant family, Li Xiangchen, was cleaning floating coal in the pit. A malicious person who was watching the coal chute asked with ill intentions, "What is your background?" Li Xiangchen sensed that this person had bad intentions, so he deliberately replied, "I am a middle peasant!" This malicious person viciously instigated, "Middle peasants are also discriminated against. He tells us to grasp revolution and promote production, but we can't work hard for him. Let's throw a couple of wooden wedges into the chute and stop production." After this class enemy threw wedges into the chute, revealing his counter-revolutionary nature, Li Xiangchen grabbed his collar and shouted, "What are you doing!" This class enemy cunningly said, "We are on the same line..." Li Xiangchen raised his lamp and shouted, "Shut up! If you don't walk away quietly, I'll let you taste the wrath of the poor and lower-middle peasants!" With the help of the left-supporting personnel of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary workers of the Sifangtai Mine actively exposed the cover of class struggle and launched an attack on class enemies who sabotage revolution and production. Since May, the production of this mine has been rising steadily. The broad masses of revolutionary workers in the Sifangtai Mine, Baoshan Mine, Lingxi Mine, and Lingdong Mine, after exposing a handful of class enemies who created production accidents and incited anarchism, further severely criticized the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" spread by Liu Shaoqi. Through revolutionary criticism, the proletarian awareness and awareness of the two-line struggle of the revolutionary workers have greatly increased, coal production has continued to rise, and the appearance of the mines has been renewed.

The broad masses of revolutionary workers in the Shuangyashan Mine Area, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "Modesty helps one to progress, conceit makes one fall behind," continue to strive for greater achievements in the face of victory and vigorously follow the continuously developing good situation. The revolutionary workers, with deep proletarian feelings of unlimited love for Great Leader Chairman Mao, say, "The production task has a target, but our loyalty to Chairman Mao is boundless." They always maintain boundless revolutionary enthusiasm and continuously push revolution and production forward.

In the process of implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production," the Shuangyashan Mine Area has carried out activities to widely publicize Chairman Mao's concern for revolutionary coal mine workers, the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the importance of coal production. This has greatly aroused the political enthusiasm of the broad masses of revolutionary workers to grasp revolution and vigorously promote production. Since this year, the entire mine area has carried out comparative learning, emulation, mutual aid, and surpassing competitions, as well as communist cooperation, which has greatly promoted the achievement of double victories in revolution and production.

    把对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚倾注到抓革命促生产实际行动中
    双鸭山煤矿革命职工大揭阶级斗争盖子，生产出现空前的大好局面
    据新华社哈尔滨十七日电　黑龙江省重点煤矿之一的双鸭山矿区广大革命职工，把多生产一吨煤，看作是向伟大领袖毛主席多献一份忠心，看作是对阶级敌人的有力打击。全矿革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产蒸蒸日上。今年一到四月份的生产计划，月月超额完成。进入五月份以来，更出现了前所未有的大好局面。
    双鸭山矿区的广大革命职工，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级觉悟大大提高，他们把贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，看作是忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的一个重要标志。他们心往抓革命促生产上想，劲往抓革命促生产上使，把对毛主席的赤胆忠心，把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲，倾注在抓革命促生产的实际行动中。广大革命职工以国家主人翁的高度责任感，坚守生产岗位和工作岗位，自觉地遵守和维护无产阶级的革命纪律，很好地完成了各项任务。四方台矿东井有一段时间因生产条件不好，欠产近两千吨煤。当时，有个别同志说，下月再补吧。但是，绝大多数矿工不同意。大家以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，艰苦奋斗，排除万难，补上了欠产的煤，超额完成了当月的国家计划。宝山矿的一个采煤小组，坚决执行毛主席“要节约闹革命”的指示，用了整整十一个小时，把压在掌子里面的十二根支柱，一根一根地抠了出来。
    双鸭山煤矿的广大革命职工，在人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，深刻地认识到贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，是一场尖锐的阶级斗争。一小撮阶级敌人为了挽救自己覆灭的命运，施展种种阴谋诡计，妄图破坏生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。四月的一天，四方台矿四井贫农出身的老工人李相臣，正在井下清理浮煤。一个看溜子的坏家伙别有用心地问道：“你是什么出身？”李相臣觉察到这个家伙不怀好意，便故意答道：“我是中农！”这个坏家伙恶狠狠地煽动说：“中农也是受排挤的。他叫咱们抓革命促生产，咱可不能给他好好干，往溜子里扔它两个木楔子，让生产停摆。”当这个坏家伙往溜子里扔楔子暴露出他的反革命本性以后，李相臣上去一把揪住他的脖子说：“你干什么！”这个阶级敌人狡猾地说：“咱们都是一条线上的……”李相臣举起手里的矿灯大声说：“住口！你要再不老老实实地给我走，就叫你尝尝贫下中农的厉害！”四方台矿革命职工在人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，大揭阶级斗争盖子，主动向破坏革命和生产的阶级敌人展开进攻。五月份以来，这个矿的生产一直节节上升。四方台矿、宝山矿、岭西矿和岭东矿的广大革命职工，在揪出一小撮制造生产事故、煽动闹无政府主义的阶级敌人之后，进一步狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。革命职工通过革命的大批判，无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争的觉悟大大提高，煤炭生产不断上升，矿井面貌焕然一新。
    双鸭山矿区的广大革命职工遵照毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，在胜利面前，再接再厉，朝气蓬勃地跟上不断发展的大好形势。革命职工们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚的无产阶级感情说，生产任务是有指标的，我们对毛主席的忠诚是无止境的。他们始终保持冲天的革命干劲，把革命和生产不断推向前进。
    在贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针的过程中，双鸭山矿区开展了大讲毛主席对煤矿革命职工的关怀，大讲无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，大讲煤炭生产的重要意义的活动，大大激发了广大革命职工狠抓革命，猛促生产的政治热情。今年以来，全矿区开展了比学赶帮超竞赛和共产主义大协作，对夺取革命、生产双胜利，起了很大的促进作用。
