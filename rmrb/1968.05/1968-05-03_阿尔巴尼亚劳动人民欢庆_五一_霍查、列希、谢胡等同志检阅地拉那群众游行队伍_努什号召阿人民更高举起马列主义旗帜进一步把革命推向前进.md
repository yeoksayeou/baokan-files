The heroic workers of Albania and all laboring people, in an atmosphere of further revolutionizing state life and people's thinking, enthusiastically celebrated May Day, the International Labor Day. In the morning of May 1st, the capital city of Tirana held a grand mass parade.

The great leader of the Albanian people, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party Enver Hoxha, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly Haxhi Lleshi, and Chairman of the Council of Ministers Mehmet Shehu, along with other party and government leaders, inspected the spirited and enthusiastic mass parade.

Before the parade began, Nushi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Chairman of the Central Council of Trade Unions, delivered a speech.

Nushi said, this year, our people are celebrating May Day, the International Labor Day, in an atmosphere of revolutionary fervor and creative enthusiasm for implementing the historic resolutions of the Fifth Congress of our Party and the teachings of our beloved leader Comrade Hoxha.

Nushi pointed out that this year, the great revolutionary activities and initiatives launched in the cities and countryside of Albania have further inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working masses, raised their socialist consciousness, and further tempered their new socialist moral qualities. This helps to complete and overfulfill production plans, further strengthen the alliance between the working class and cooperative farmers, greatly consolidate the unity of the people around the Party, further enhance the leadership role of the working class, further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and more powerfully oppose the various manifestations of bourgeois and revisionist ideology. The great process of revolutionization, guided by the thoughts of the Fifth Congress of the Party, is continuously deepening in all aspects of Albanian life.

In discussing the current international situation, Nushi said that the revolutionary movement against imperialism and modern revisionism is continuously rising, the enemies of the people of all countries are suffering continuous defeats, and the working class in capitalist countries is bravely fighting against capitalist exploitation and violence. In the fierce class struggle against bourgeois and revisionist traitors, Marxist-Leninist thought is increasingly victorious, and new revolutionary forces are increasingly growing and consolidating. The developments in countries ruled by modern revisionists have once again proven their inevitable disintegration and failure. These developments are creating favorable conditions for the working class in these countries to join the battle to smash the revisionist clique and rebuild the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Nushi pointed out that in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the revolutionary struggles of the people against imperialism, colonialism, and fascist violence of the reactionaries are surging. The black people's anti-violence struggle in the United States itself shows the deep crisis of American imperialism.

Nushi said, we extend revolutionary greetings to the class brothers and people of all countries who are struggling for national and social liberation and for the maintenance and consolidation of national independence.

Nushi said, we extend our warmest congratulations to the brotherly Chinese people. Nushi pointed out that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, further advancing the cause of revolution and socialism.

Nushi said, we pay tribute to the brotherly Vietnamese people. We have always and will continue to fully support the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people. Whether through conspiracies or force, nothing can weaken the struggle of the Vietnamese people. The victory of the Vietnamese people is certain, and inevitable defeat awaits the American imperialists.

Nushi finally called on all Albanian laboring people to further advance the revolution, to continuously consolidate the people's power, to further strengthen the unity of the Party and the people, to make the socialist homeland invincible, and to hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and revolution in socialist Albania.

Nushi's speech was repeatedly interrupted by shouts of "Long live the Albanian Labor Party!" "Long live Comrade Hoxha!" "Enver-Mao!" "People's China!" "Vietnam will win!" "Glory to Marxism-Leninism!" and enthusiastic applause.

After Nushi's speech, the grand mass parade began. Albanian workers and peasants who have achieved great successes in the revolutionization movement and on the production front, spirited old guerrillas, gallant male and female militia members, cadres, and young students marched in orderly ranks past the reviewing stand, receiving the inspection of the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Hoxha, and other party and government leaders.

The parade participants held up giant portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

The parade participants held up a giant portrait of the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Hoxha.

The parade participants held up a giant portrait of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. They held up banners reading "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!" "Long live Albanian-Chinese friendship!" They repeatedly shouted "Enver-Mao!" "People's China!"

The parade participants repeatedly shouted: "Vietnam will win!" "Carry the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism to the end!"

In the evening of May 1st, the laboring people of Tirana held a grand gala. The great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Hoxha, and other party and government leaders attended the gala and watched fireworks with the masses.

　　阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民欢庆“五一”
　　霍查、列希、谢胡等同志检阅地拉那群众游行队伍
　　努什号召阿人民更高举起马列主义旗帜进一步把革命推向前进
    据新华社地拉那一日电　英雄的阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级和全体劳动人民，在国家生活和人的思想进一步革命化的气氛中，热烈庆祝“五一”国际劳动节。一日上午，首都地拉那举行了盛大的群众游行。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记恩维尔·霍查同志，人民议会主席团主席哈奇·列希同志，部长会议主席穆罕默德·谢胡同志等党政领导人检阅了斗志昂扬、意气风发的群众游行队伍。
    游行开始前，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、工会中央理事会主席努什讲了话。
    努什说，今年，我国人民是在为实现党的第五次代表大会的历史性决议和我们亲爱的领袖霍查同志的教导所表现出的革命化气氛和创造热情进一步发展的情况下，庆祝“五一”国际劳动节的。
    努什指出，今年，在阿尔巴尼亚的城市和乡村掀起的伟大的革命活动和倡议，更加激发了劳动群众的革命干劲，提高了他们的社会主义觉悟，进一步锻炼了他们的社会主义的新的道德品质。这有助于完成和超额完成生产计划，进一步加强工人阶级同合作社农民的联盟，大大地巩固人民在党周围的团结，更加提高工人阶级的领导作用，更进一步巩固无产阶级专政，更有力地反对资产阶级和修正主义思想的各种表现。在党的第五次代表大会的思想指引下的伟大的革命化进程，正在阿尔巴尼亚生活的各个领域里不断深入下去。
    努什在谈到当前的国际形势时说，反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的革命运动正在不断高涨，各国人民的敌人不断遭到惨败，资本主义国家的工人阶级正在英勇地开展反对资本主义剥削和暴力的斗争。在反对资产阶级和修正主义叛徒的激烈的阶级搏斗中，马克思列宁主义思想正在日益取得胜利，新的革命力量正在日益壮大和巩固。现代修正主义者掌权的国家的事态发展，又一次证明了他们的必然的分崩离析和失败。这种事态的发展，正在为这些国家的工人阶级投入粉碎修正主义集团和重建无产阶级专政的战斗，创造有利的条件。
    努什指出，在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，各国人民反对帝国主义、殖民主义和反动派的法西斯暴力的革命斗争，风起云涌。在美国本土发生的黑人抗暴斗争，表明了美帝国主义深刻的危机。
    努什说，我们向世界上正在为争取民族和社会解放、维护和巩固民族独立的阶级兄弟和各国人民致以革命的敬礼。
    努什说，我们向兄弟的中国人民致以最热烈的祝贺。努什指出，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下的中国人民，在无产阶级文化大革命中取得了决定性的胜利，更加推进了革命和社会主义的事业。
    努什说，我们向兄弟的越南人民致敬。我们始终不渝地完全支持越南人民的英勇斗争。无论是阴谋诡计，或者是武力，都丝毫不能削弱越南人民的斗争。越南人民的胜利是肯定的，等待着美帝国主义者的是不可避免的失败。
    努什最后号召全阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民进一步把革命推向前进，不断巩固人民政权，进一步加强党和人民的团结，使社会主义祖国坚不可摧，使马克思列宁主义和革命的旗帜在社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚举得更高。
    努什的讲话不断为“阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！”“霍查同志万岁！”“恩维尔—毛泽东！”“人民中国！”“越南必胜！”“光荣属于马克思列宁主义！”等口号声和热烈的掌声所打断。
    努什讲话后，开始了盛大的群众游行。在革命化运动中和生产战线上取得巨大成就的阿尔巴尼亚工人和农民，神采奕奕的老游击队员，飒爽英姿的男女民兵，机关干部和青年学生等，排着整齐的队伍，走过主席台前，接受阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志和其他党政领导人的检阅。
    游行群众高举着马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的巨幅画像。
    游行群众高举着阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志的巨幅画像。
    游行群众高举着中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像。举着写有“中国无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“阿中友谊万岁！”的标语牌。他们不断高呼“恩维尔—毛泽东！”“人民中国！”
    游行的人群不断高呼：“越南必胜！”“把反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义的斗争进行到底！”
    一日晚上，地拉那劳动群众还举行了盛大的联欢晚会。阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志和其他党政领导人出席了晚会，同群众一起观看了焰火。
