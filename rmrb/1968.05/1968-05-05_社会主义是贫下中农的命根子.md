The revolutionary masses of Jianchangzi Commune, Panshan County, Liaoning Province, with the help of the People's Liberation Army propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought, have, in light of the class struggle situation and current tasks, carried out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism and struggle, raising their awareness of class struggle and line struggle. Broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, have concentrated their efforts on criticizing the "three freedoms and one contract" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, striking a heavy blow at the arrogant attacks of the class enemy, consolidating the socialist collective economy, and developing agricultural production. Below is a selection of articles from the peasants of Jianchangzi Commune during the struggle of criticism and struggle.

	Chinese Khrushchev is the most vicious enemy who has infiltrated the Party. During the period when our national economy encountered temporary difficulties, he collaborated with the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries in their anti-China chorus, launching a frenzied attack on socialism and spreading the black wind of "three freedoms and one contract." He blabbered on about how "now the poor households are demanding: 'Give me a few mu of land, and I can live without relying on you.'" He pretended to be speaking for the masses. We must expose his deceitful words and see where he really stands and for whom he speaks.

	Chinese Khrushchev's nonsense about dividing land to households is the greatest slander against us poor and lower-middle peasants. We poor and lower-middle peasants suffered endless oppression and exploitation in the old society. We are the most steadfast in walking the socialist road. Dividing land to households is not our demand but is something forced on us poor and lower-middle peasants by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. Once his "three freedoms and one contract" black goods were released, his little lackeys in our area immediately followed suit, using "caring for life" and "solving difficulties" as excuses, forcing us poor and lower-middle peasants with less labor power and more difficult lives to leave the collective and become "mountain households," relying on ourselves to open up land to live. At that time, we felt that this was not the path pointed out by Chairman Mao and did not benefit the poor and lower-middle peasants, so everyone refused to become "mountain households." Then they said, "This is the order from above." Finally, they forced six poor peasant households to go up the mountain to farm individually. Our several "mountain households," with adults and children working from dawn to dusk all year round, were exhausted and the grain we harvested was not enough to eat. Some poor and lower-middle peasants with many mouths to feed, less labor power, and illnesses found life even more difficult. If we followed the Chinese Khrushchev's method of dividing land to households, in the end, we would only be given a begging basket and a bundle for fleeing, retreating, and suffering twice.

	We several poor peasant households who went up the mountain were originally the backbone of the collectivization road. We believed that farming was for the revolution. We loved Chairman Mao dearly and actively participated in the political activities of the team. However, after going up the mountain, we could not participate in the team's meetings and study sessions, and we could not hear Chairman Mao's voice in time, so our thoughts fell behind. It was the socialist education movement work team sent by Chairman Mao that brought us down from the mountain and liberated us for the second time.

	The so-called "demand of the poor households" by Chinese Khrushchev is actually the demand of the landlords and rich peasants who have been overthrown by the proletariat. Dividing land to households is actually the dream of these guys of "returning the land to the family." This once again exposes that Chinese Khrushchev is the representative of the exploiting class.

	Chairman Mao said, "Only socialism can save China." Socialism is the lifeline of poor and lower-middle peasants. Poor and lower-middle peasants unitedly walk the socialist road, and they fear nothing, can support the sky if it falls, and can fill the earth if it sinks. Last spring, a rare spring flood occurred, washing away all the seeds that had just been sown on the mountain slopes and riverbanks. The community members relied on the collective's strength, carried soil to repair the land, and in a short time, replanted all the damaged land. In May and June, it rained continuously, and weeds grew in the fields. The entire team, men, women, old, and young, went out to weed and pull weeds in the rain, overcoming the weeds. Soon, they overcame the pestilence. In this way, we overcame one natural disaster after another, not only did we not reduce production, but we also achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The grain output of our fourth brigade doubled compared to 1962 when the black wind of "three freedoms and one contract" was the strongest. The grain output of the entire brigade increased by 35% compared to the previous year. Our brigade, which used to need to eat 30,000 to 110,000 jin of state-distributed grain every year, has leaped to delivering 110,000 jin of grain to the state.

	We poor and lower-middle peasants have suffered enough from the exploitation system of the old society, tasted the sweetness of socialism, and deeply understand that the collectivization road is the happiest. We hate the biggest capitalist-roader, Chinese Khrushchev, to death. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, criticize Chinese Khrushchev thoroughly, and criticize him to the point of complete exposure.

　　社会主义是贫下中农的命根子

　　辽宁省本溪县山城子公社碱厂卜大队革命群众，在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，结合阶级斗争形势和当前任务，深入地持久地开展了革命大批判，提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。广大贫下中农和革命群众，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚，对中国赫鲁晓夫无比仇恨，集中地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的“三自一包”，狠狠地打击了阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，巩固了社会主义集体经济，发展了农业生产。下面是碱厂卜大队社员在大批判中的来稿选登。
                  ——编者
    中国赫鲁晓夫是混入党内的最凶恶的敌人。在我国国民经济遭到暂时困难时期，他配合帝、修、反的反华大合唱，向社会主义发动猖狂进攻，刮起了“三自一包”的黑风。他胡说什么：“现在困难户就提出这个要求：‘你分几亩地给我，我可以活，我不靠你。’困难户提出的这个道理，这也是个道理。”他把自己打扮成是为群众说话的。我们要戳穿他骗人的鬼话，看看他到底是站在什么立场上，为谁说话的。
    中国赫鲁晓夫胡说分田到户是困难户的要求，这是对我们贫下中农的最大污蔑。我们贫下中农在旧社会受尽了压迫、剥削，我们走社会主义道路最坚定。分田到户，决不是我们的要求，而是这个党内最大的走资派强加在我们贫下中农头上的。他的“三自一包”的黑货一出笼，他在我们地区的小爪牙就马上照办，以“照顾生活”、“解决困难”为名，硬要我们劳力少、生活较困难的贫下中农，离开集体去当“上山户”，靠自己在山上开荒过日子。当时我们就感到，这同毛主席指出的道不是一条道，不符合贫下中农的利益，大家都不同意当“上山户”。这时，他们又说：“这是上边的指示。”终于强迫我们六户贫农上山搞单干。我们几家“上山户”，大人孩子一年四季起早贪黑地干，累得要死，打的粮食还不够吃。一些人口多、劳力少、又有病祸的贫下中农，生活就更困难了。如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫分田到户的办法干下去，最后只会分给我们一个讨饭的篮子，一副逃荒的担子，走回头路，吃二遍苦。
    我们几户上山的贫农，原来都是走集体化道路的骨干。我们认为，种田是为了革命。我们无限热爱毛主席，积极参加队里的政治活动。可是，上山以后，队里开会、学习不能参加，毛主席的声音不能及时听到，思想也就跟不上趟了。是毛主席派来的社会主义教育运动工作队，才把我们救下山来，第二次解放了我们。
    中国赫鲁晓夫所谓“困难户的要求”，实际上是被无产阶级专了政的地主、富农的要求。分田到户，实际上就是这些家伙梦想的“土地还家”。这就再次暴露了中国赫鲁晓夫是剥削阶级的代表。
    毛主席说：“只有社会主义能够救中国。”社会主义是贫下中农的命根子。贫下中农齐心走社会主义道路，就什么都不怕，天塌下来能顶住，地陷下去能填平。去年春天，发生了一场罕见的春洪，把刚刚播下种的山坡、河旁地全冲坏了。社员们依靠集体的力量，抬土修地，在很短的时间内就把冲坏的地全部补种上了。五、六月间又是连雨天，地里发生了草荒，全队男女老少齐出动，顶着雨铲地拔草，战胜了草荒。不久，又战胜了虫灾。就这样，我们战胜了一个又一个自然灾害，不但没有减产，还获得了史无前例的大丰收。我们四队的粮食产量，比“三自一包”黑风刮得最厉害的一九六二年翻了一番。全大队的粮食产量，比前一年超产百分之三十五。我们大队由过去每年需要吃国家统销粮三万到十一万斤，一跃变成向国家交售粮食十一万斤。
    我们贫下中农吃够了旧社会剥削制度的苦，尝到了社会主义的甜，深深懂得走集体化道路最幸福。我们恨死了中国赫鲁晓夫这个最大的走资派。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把中国赫鲁晓夫批深批透，批倒批臭。
