	At the same time as the black anti-violence struggle, the American people's struggle against the Vietnam War, and the burgeoning worker's movement, the progressive student movement in the United States is also surging forward, reaching an unprecedented height in American history.

	This year alone, more than a hundred schools in the United States have seen strikes and demonstrations, opposing racial discrimination, the Vietnam War, and the dehumanizing education system, and demanding democratic rights. In mid-March, a massive strike involving tens of thousands of Mexican, black, and white students took place in Los Angeles. In late April, a strike involving hundreds of thousands of people against the Vietnam War swept through major cities such as Washington, New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, affecting dozens of colleges, universities, and many high schools. At the end of April, a major strike at Columbia University shook the United States. Black and white students occupied five buildings on campus, raised red flags, and engaged in fierce battles with fascist military police. This strike is still ongoing, with red balloons bearing the word "strike" still floating over Columbia University. On May 9, students at Southern Illinois University clashed with military police, and more than 1,700 black high school students in Camden, New Jersey, occupied Camden High School.

	American progressive students are increasingly recognizing the reactionary nature of the domestic and foreign policies of the American ruling class through their struggles, and their political awareness is continuously rising. Many students have even directed their struggle against American imperialism. This situation has made the students' struggle more resolute. In recent large-scale strikes, student masses have shown a spirit of fearlessness and daring to fight; they are not afraid of being expelled, beaten, or arrested, and they remain undeterred in the face of large numbers of armed police. The American ruling class is very uneasy about this new trend in the American student movement. Recently, U.S. Vice President Humphrey and former Vice President Nixon have both publicly denounced the revolutionary actions of Columbia University students; the American magazine *Newsweek* has also exclaimed that the students' struggle is a "challenge to the [American] system," and that "today's students are different from previous generations."

	It should be noted that in the American progressive student movement, black students and white students are increasingly seeing through the instigation and provocation by the American monopoly capitalist class between them, and are becoming more united in their struggles. The joint struggle of black and white students at Columbia University, and the joint struggle of Mexican, black, and white students in Los Angeles are vivid examples of this. Moreover, the entire student movement and the American black anti-violence struggle, as well as the American people's struggle against the Vietnam War, are becoming more closely linked. One of the reasons for the Columbia University students' strike is their opposition to the school's seizure of a park in the Harlem area belonging to black people to build a sports field, which is a direct support for the black people of Harlem. The struggle of Columbia University students has also received strong support from the black people of Harlem, thereby strengthening the unity between the progressive student movement and the fighting black organizations. At the same time, many students are strengthening their ties with workers and actively promoting the combination of the student movement and the worker's movement.

    在黑人抗暴斗争、人民反侵越斗争、工人运动蓬勃发展的同时
    美国进步学生运动风起云涌
    在美国黑人抗暴斗争、美国人民反对侵越战争的斗争和美国工人运动蓬勃发展的同时，美国进步学生运动也风起云涌，出现了美国历史上前所未有的新高涨。
    今年以来，美国已有一百多所学校爆发了罢课和游行示威，反对种族歧视，反对侵越战争，反对奴化教育，要求民主权利。三月中旬在美国洛杉矶市爆发了有几万墨西哥族学生、黑人学生和白人学生共同参加的大罢课。四月下旬爆发的有几十万人参加的反对侵越战争的大罢课，席卷了华盛顿、纽约、芝加哥、旧金山等各大城市的几十所大专院校和许多中学。四月底，又爆发了震动美国的哥伦比亚大学的大罢课，黑人学生和白人学生占领了学校五座大楼，升起了红旗，并和前去镇压的法西斯军警进行了激烈的搏斗。这次大罢课到现在仍在坚持中，写着“罢课”字样的红色大气球还在哥伦比亚大学上空飘荡，五月九日，又爆发了南伊利诺斯大学学生和军警的激战和新泽西州坎登市一千七百余名黑人中学生占领坎登中学的斗争。
    美国的进步学生在斗争中日益认清美国统治集团国内外政策的反动本质，政治觉悟不断提高。许多学生还把斗争锋芒直接指向美国帝国主义制度。这种情况使美国学生的斗争越来越坚决。在最近的几次大罢课中，学生群众表现出了不畏强暴、敢于斗争的精神；他们不怕被开除，被拷打，被逮捕，面对着大批武装警察，毫不动摇。对于美国学生运动的这一新的发展趋势，美国统治阶级十分不安，最近，美国副总统汉弗莱和前副总统尼克松接连跳出来对哥伦比亚大学学生的革命行动破口大骂；美国《新闻周刊》也惊呼学生的斗争是“对（美国）制度的挑战”，“今天的学生和以前几代的学生不一样了”。
    需要指出的是，在美国进步学生运动中，黑人学生和白人学生，正日益识破美国垄断资产阶级在他们中间进行的挑拨和煽动，在斗争中互相支持，团结得越来越紧密。哥伦比亚大学黑人学生和白人学生的共同斗争，洛杉矶市墨西哥族学生、黑人学生和白人学生的共同斗争都是这方面的生动的例子。而且，整个学生运动和美国黑人抗暴斗争以及美国人民反侵越战争的斗争，也结合得更加密切了。哥伦比亚大学学生罢课斗争的原因之一，就是反对校方侵占哈莱姆区黑人的公园建造运动场，这是对哈莱姆区黑人的直接支持，而哥伦比亚大学学生的斗争又得到了哈莱姆区黑人的大力支持，从而加强了进步学生运动和战斗的黑人组织的团结。与此同时，许多学生还正在加强和工人的联系，积极促进学生运动和工人运动的结合。
