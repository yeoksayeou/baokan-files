The great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is flying high over the Qinghai Plateau. Revolutionary committees have been established in all cities, prefectures, and counties of Qinghai Province. All levels of revolutionary committees, remembering the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, are leading the masses in relentlessly attacking the class enemies.

XINING, May 18 (Xinhua) — Under the personal direction of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the May 16 Circular two years ago. Since then, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people in Qinghai Province have grasped Mao Zedong's theory on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. They have achieved decisive victories in the struggle to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party from the bottom up. Following the glorious establishment of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee last August, all one city, six autonomous prefectures, and 37 counties in the province have now established revolutionary committees. Except for a very few, all grassroots units in urban and rural areas have also established revolutionary committees. All levels of revolutionary committees are striving, under Chairman Mao's guidance, to build these committees into revolutionary, authoritative, closely linked with the masses, and vigorous organs of power in the midst of struggle.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are aimed at seizing power and consolidating it." The revolutionary cadres of Qinghai Province have deeply felt from the practical struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that seizing power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party relies on Mao Zedong Thought, and consolidating the newly born revolutionary committees also relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Since the establishment of revolutionary committees at all levels in Qinghai Province, they have always placed the task of leading the broad revolutionary masses to better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the highest, greatest, first, and most important position. Members of revolutionary committees at all levels regard it as their highest requirement to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They regard studying, executing, propagating, and defending Mao Zedong Thought as their most sacred duty. Since this year, provinces, cities, prefectures, and some counties have held conferences of activists in studying the works of Chairman Mao. These conferences, in the form of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, have seriously studied, deeply understood, and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, further promoting the victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The province has also successively dispatched Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to rural and pastoral areas to assist local revolutionary masses in holding various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Under the leadership of revolutionary committees at all levels, provinces, cities, prefectures, counties, communes (townships), production brigades, and production teams have all established study classes. Even in remote mountainous areas and vast grasslands, study classes have been set up. The great Mao Zedong Thought has been widely spread across the vast Qinghai Plateau.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution launched by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the reactionary Kuomintang led by the broad revolutionary masses, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Revolutionary committees at all levels in Qinghai Province were born in the storm of class struggle and have been consolidated and developed in the storm of class struggle. All levels of revolutionary committees remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," and are firmly grasping the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. They are further mobilizing the masses, organizing the masses, and leading the masses in relentlessly launching fierce attacks against class enemies. Since March last year, the province has launched seven waves of revolutionary criticism. The broad revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses have firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, always directing the spearhead of the struggle at China's Khrushchev and his agents within the Party, and closely combining revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation within their own units. Through in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism spread by China's Khrushchev and his agents has been continuously eliminated, and a batch of hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries have been exposed, smashing their plots to overthrow the revolutionary committees.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most fundamental thing in the reform of state organs is to connect with the masses." The vast majority of members of revolutionary committees at all levels in Qinghai Province, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, often go deep into the grassroots and production frontlines, maintaining close contact with the masses. Once the revolutionary committees of states, prefectures, districts, and communes are established, they focus their work on rural and pastoral areas. Once the revolutionary committees of industrial and mining enterprises are established, they focus their work on workshops and production teams. Many comrades at all levels of revolutionary committees carry the works of Chairman Mao, pack their luggage, traverse mountains and rivers, go to factories, rural areas, and pastoral areas, and live, work, and struggle with workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and poor herdsmen. They study Chairman Mao's works together, criticize and repudiate revisionism together, and discuss how to hold power for the proletariat and use power for the proletariat. Many revolutionary masses living in deep mountains and remote areas, seeing comrades from provincial, prefectural, and county revolutionary committees bringing Chairman Mao's works and latest instructions to them, excitedly say: "Revolutionary committees are good! We support them a thousand times, ten thousand times!" Many units' revolutionary committees often invite revolutionary masses to participate in their meetings, helping revolutionary committee members to examine their thoughts, work, and style, and placing the revolutionary committees under better supervision by the masses.

Revolutionary committees at all levels in Qinghai Province, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, are striving to strengthen ideological and political line construction on the basis of strengthening ideological revolutionization, resolutely "breaking down overlapping administrative organs and streamlining personnel," and striving to achieve organizational revolutionization. They are making the revolutionary committees into compact and powerful command departments with small leading bodies, few staff, and high work efficiency.

Due to the leadership of revolutionary committees at all levels in earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production has been promoted. This year, industrial production in Qinghai Province has steadily increased, and the situation of agricultural and pastoral production is also very good, with a prosperous scene everywhere.

    毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍青海高原
    青海省各市州县全部建立革命委员会
    各级革委会牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导，率领群众不停顿地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻
    新华社西宁十八日电　我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》发表两年来，青海省广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，掌握了毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论，在全省范围内取得了向党内一小撮走资派自下而上夺权斗争的决定性胜利。继去年八月青海省革命委员会光荣诞生之后，目前全省一个市、六个自治州和三十七个县，已经全部成立了革命委员会。城乡各基层单位，除极少数外，也都建立了革命委员会。各级革命委员会正遵照毛主席的教导，努力在斗争中把革委会建设成为革命的、有无产阶级权威的、密切联系群众的、朝气蓬勃的权力机构。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”青海省无产阶级革命派从无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践中深深体会到，向党内一小撮走资派夺权靠的是毛泽东思想，巩固新生的革命委员会也必须靠毛泽东思想。青海省各级革命委员会成立以后，始终把带领广大革命群众更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位。各级革命委员会成员，都把无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，作为对自己的最高要求，把学习、执行、宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想，当作最神圣的职责。今年以来，省、市、州和一部分县，都召开过学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会。这些大会采用办毛泽东思想学习班的形式，认真学习、深刻领会、条条落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，进一步推动了无产阶级文化大革命运动的胜利发展。全省还先后派出毛泽东思想宣传队分赴农村、牧区，协助当地革命群众举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。在各级革命委员会的领导下，省、市、州、县、公社（乡）、生产大队和生产队都办起了学习班，在偏僻的山区和辽阔的草原上，也办起了学习班。伟大的毛泽东思想，在广阔的青海高原得到了空前的大普及。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”青海省各级革命委员会在阶级斗争的风浪中产生，又在阶级斗争的风浪中得到了巩固和发展。各级革命委员会牢记伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，进一步发动群众，组织群众，率领群众不停顿地向阶级敌人发动了猛烈进攻。从去年三月份以来，全省掀起了七次革命大批判高潮。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，始终把斗争矛头指向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在青海的代理人等党内一小撮走资派，并且把革命大批判和本单位的斗、批、改紧密结合起来。通过深入持久地开展革命大批判，不断清除中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所散布的反革命修正主义流毒，同时揪出了一批隐藏的叛徒、特务和反革命分子，粉碎了他们妄图颠覆革命委员会的阴谋。
    毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”青海省各级革命委员会的绝大多数成员，遵照毛主席的教导，经常深入基层，深入生产第一线，同群众保持紧密的联系。各州、县、区、公社的革委会一成立，就把工作重点放在农村、牧区，工矿企业的革委会一成立，就把工作重点放在车间和生产班组。各级革委会的许多同志，带着毛主席著作，背上行李，跋山涉水，到工厂、农村和牧区，和工人、贫下中农、贫苦牧民同吃、同住、同劳动，和他们一起学习毛主席著作，一起斗私批修，一起商量怎样为无产阶级掌好权、用好权。有些居住在深山和偏僻地区的革命群众，见到省、州、县革委会的同志为他们送来毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示，激动地说：“革命委员会就是好！我们一千个拥护，一万个支持！”很多单位的革命委员会经常请革命群众参加他们的会议，帮助革委会成员检查思想，检查工作，检查作风，把革委会更好地置于群众监督之下。
    青海省各级革命委员会遵照毛主席的教导，在加强思想革命化建设的基础上，坚决“打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政”，努力实现组织革命化，使革命委员会成为领导班子小，办事人员少，工作效率高的精悍有力的战斗指挥部。
    由于各级革命委员会带领广大革命群众认真贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，促进了工、农、牧业生产的发展。今年，青海全省的工业生产稳步上升，农牧业生产情况都很好，到处是一派欣欣向荣的景象。
