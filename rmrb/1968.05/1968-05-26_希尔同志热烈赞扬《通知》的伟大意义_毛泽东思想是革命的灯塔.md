Comrade Hill Warmly Praises the Great Significance of the "Notification"
Mao Zedong Thought is the Beacon of the Revolution

BEIJING, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The chairman of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist), Comrade Hill, in an article published in the "Vanguard" newspaper on the second anniversary of the issuance of the "Notification" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on May 16, 1966, warmly praises the great significance of this epoch-making document. The full text of the article is as follows:

The second anniversary of the issuance of the "Notification" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on May 16, 1966, is attracting great attention.

The significance of this document far exceeds the boundaries of China. The "Notification" solves a fundamental new problem in Marxism-Leninism, that is, how to carry out a political revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

This "Notification," drafted under the leadership of Chairman Mao, is a direct product of the highest development of Marxism-Leninism -- Mao Zedong Thought.

In the current world situation, no matter who tries to downplay or belittle the importance of Mao Zedong Thought, it is detrimental to the cause of the people's revolution.

All the events happening now emphasize the importance of mastering Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao is the beacon for all oppressed peoples. The struggle of the Vietnamese people is a shining example.

Chairman Mao's call has greatly supported the struggle of black Americans against violence. Chairman Mao's thought guides the rebellious actions of French students and workers. The desperate situation of capitalism is making rebellious actions spread more and more around the world. Mao Zedong Thought provides scientific guidance for these rebellious actions. This is the reality; this reality is shaking the foundations of the bourgeoisie. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has greatly inspired all rebellious actions.

In Australia, the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought has made great progress.

Opposing Mao Zedong Thought is part of the attack on Marxism-Leninism worldwide. In Australia, this is done by the Alonzo-Khrushchevites.

Worldwide, the opposition to Mao Zedong Thought is led by Khrushchev and his successors. In China, it is led by the Chinese Khrushchev.

Indeed, for the capitalists, suppressing Mao Zedong Thought is a matter of life and death, just as suppressing the thoughts of Marx, Engels, and Lenin was a matter of life and death in the past.

For the capitalists, suppressing Chairman Mao's thought is an even more urgent matter. This is because their situation is more desperate than before, and Chairman Mao's thought has armed those opposing capitalism with an invaluable weapon. Chairman Mao's thought is the beacon of the revolution.

Comrade Lin Biao is correct: "Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism in the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards worldwide victory." In the eyes of the capitalists, this is a terrifying thing, but for us, it is a great thing. Therefore, to highlight Mao Zedong Thought and strive to establish the supremacy of Mao Zedong Thought is to do what the enemy opposes. Doing what the enemy opposes is a great thing. In Australia, significant progress has been made in mastering Mao Zedong Thought. More people are reading Chairman Mao's books. More people are striving to act according to Mao Zedong Thought.

The increasing number of materials received by the "Vanguard" clearly shows that the Australian workers and laboring people, under the guidance of Chairman Mao, are setting aside revisionism, political subjectivism (political wishes), sectarianism (forming secret small groups), and sacred cows. They are recognizing the reality of Australia and Australia's position in the world. They are recognizing this reality and taking action to change it.

However, we must not be complacent. We face new and greater tasks. The reality in Australia is that a great struggle is surging in every part of the country. This is happening in a world where struggles are intensifying every moment.

It is increasingly important for more people to truly master Mao Zedong Thought.

### 希尔同志热烈赞扬《通知》的伟大意义  毛泽东思想是革命的灯塔

    希尔同志热烈赞扬《通知》的伟大意义
    毛泽东思想是革命的灯塔
    《通知》解决了马克思列宁主义的一个带根本性的新问题，即在无产阶级专政下，如何进行政治革命
    新华社墨尔本二十三日电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）主席希尔，在中国共产党中央委员会一九六六年五月十六日《通知》发表两周年的时候，在《先锋报》上发表文章，热烈赞扬这个划时代的文献的重要意义。文章的全文如下：
    中国共产党中央委员会一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》发表两周年，正受到极大的注意。
    这个文献的重要意义远远地超出了中国的范围。《通知》解决了马克思列宁主义的一个带根本性的新问题，即在无产阶级专政下，如何进行政治革命。
    这个在毛主席主持下制定的《通知》，是马克思列宁主义的最高发展——毛泽东思想的直接产物。
    在当前世界的情况下，不管是谁用什么办法缩小或贬低毛泽东思想的重要意义，都不利于人民的革命事业。
    目前发生的一切事件，都着重表明了掌握毛泽东思想的重要意义。毛主席是一切被压迫人民的灯塔。越南人民的斗争，就是一个光辉的典范。
    毛主席的号召大大地支持了美国黑人的抗暴斗争。毛主席的思想指导着法国学生和工人的造反行动。资本主义的危急情况使世界各地的反抗行动越来越扩大了。毛泽东思想为这种反抗行动提供了科学的指导。这是实际情况；这种实际情况，动摇了资产阶级的基础。中国无产阶级文化革命大大地鼓舞了一切造反行动。
    在澳大利亚，学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的活动有了很大的发展。
    抵制毛泽东思想，这是在世界范围内对马克思列宁主义进行攻击的一部分。在澳大利亚，阿隆斯赫鲁晓夫分子进行了这种勾当。
    在世界范围内，抵制毛泽东思想是由赫鲁晓夫及其继承者带头干的。在中国国内，则是由中国赫鲁晓夫带头干的。
    的确，对资本家来说，压制毛泽东思想，过去是、现在也是一件至关紧要的事，正象过去压制马克思、恩格斯和列宁的思想是一件至关紧要的事一样。
    对资本家来说，压制毛主席思想是一件更加迫切的事。这是因为他们的处境比以前更加危急了，而毛主席的思想则以无比宝贵的武器武装了反对资本主义的人。毛主席思想是革命的灯塔。
    林彪说得对：“毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。”在资本家看来，这是一件可怕的事，而在我们看来，则是件大好事。因此，突出毛泽东思想，为确立毛泽东思想高于一切的地位而奋斗，就是做敌人所反对的事。做敌人所反对的事是件大好事。在澳大利亚，在掌握毛泽东思想方面，已取得了极为可喜的进步。有更多的人正在读毛泽东的书。有更多的人正在努力按照毛泽东思想办事。
    《先锋报》源源不断收到的越来越多的材料很清楚地表明，在毛主席指引下的澳大利亚工人和劳动人民正在把修正主义、政治上的主观主义（政治上的主观愿望）、宗派主义（结成秘密的小集团）和圣牛甩在一旁。他们正在认识澳大利亚的实际和澳大利亚在世界上所占的地位。他们认识了这种实际情况，正在采取行动改变它。
    可是，我们决不能自满起来。我们面临着新的更大的任务。澳大利亚的实际是，在澳大利亚各地都掀起了巨大的斗争高潮。这是发生在斗争每时每刻都在加剧的世界上。
    让更多的人真正掌握毛泽东思想，这一点越来越重要了。
