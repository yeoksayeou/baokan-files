In the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary teachers and students of Malian Hutong Primary School in Beijing's Dongcheng District, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's brilliant "March 7" directive, "May 7" directive, and a series of latest directives, have launched a sustained, mass-based revolutionary criticism movement during the period of resuming classes and making revolution. Their experience is: to hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, link it with reality, and be specific. Use revolutionary criticism to drive the resumption of classes and make revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution." "Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." The revolutionary teachers and students of Malian Hutong Primary School, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have always focused on revolutionary criticism. The specific method is to link it with the school's actual situation and the personal experiences of revolutionary teachers and students to carry out revolutionary criticism.

At the beginning of the revolutionary criticism, teachers and students had some conflicting thoughts. Some teachers thought that the impact of the revisionist educational line on primary schools was not significant, and there was nothing to criticize. High-grade teachers were afraid that criticizing the revisionist educational line would backfire. Low-grade teachers thought that the children had just started school, had low cultural levels, and could not write much. Students felt that the revisionist educational line had little to do with them. Some said, "We have never seen Chinese Khrushchev, so what is there to criticize?"

To address these issues, revolutionary teachers and students, with the help of the PLA, repeatedly studied "Chairman Mao on Educational Revolution." In the study, everyone used Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution to compare and examine the problems in primary school education, discovering that primary schools are not without revisionist poison to criticize, but rather there are many things to criticize. For eighteen years, the primary education front has always been a sharp and complex struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. Whether or not to criticize the revisionist educational line pushed by Chinese Khrushchev today is a big issue concerning whether we can cultivate and train millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

How to start the criticism? This is another contradiction. Chairman Mao said: "To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, we must rely on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in schools, and rely on the activists among them, that is, the proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." Chairman Mao's directive pointed out the direction for revolutionary teachers and students to carry out revolutionary criticism. Everyone, with "Chairman Mao on Educational Revolution" as a powerful ideological weapon, took the revisionist educational line pushed by Chinese Khrushchev as a black target, launching a sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism throughout the school.

The revolutionary criticism in Malian Hutong Primary School started with criticizing "intellectual education first" and "grades as the criterion." Teachers and students, through recalling and comparing, personal experiences, and speaking out, exposed the manifestations of the revisionist educational line in primary schools and criticized them deeply. Teachers first took "criticizing oneself and criticizing revisionism" as the guiding principle, taking the lead in front of the students to denounce the harm of the revisionist educational line, realizing that they had not studied Mao Zedong Thought well in the past and blindly pushed the revisionist educational line, making mistakes of one kind or another in their work. A teacher said at the criticism meeting: "In the past, to pursue grades, I even did not treat students as class brothers. Every day, it was either forcing them to write characters or do arithmetic. Write in class, do homework at home. Seeing students sweating in the summer in the classroom, with their arms aching, but their little hands still writing, I felt sorry for them. But then I thought: if I don't make students work hard, how can they get good results? I was especially strict with students who were not good at studying, often keeping them until eight or nine o'clock in the evening, seriously damaging the students' physical and mental health. At that time, I still thought this was being responsible for the revolutionary work! I was really unaware that I had fallen into Chinese Khrushchev's trap." Some teachers said that the revisionist educational line only cared about grades, not class struggle, and that with grades came everything. Using the high and low of grades to measure the good and bad of students, causing disunity among students; using the high and low of grades to measure the good and bad of teachers, causing opposition among teachers. More seriously, it instilled dirty ideas of personal gain in students from a young age, damaging the healthy growth of the next generation. Following the teachers, the students also stood up to denounce the harm of the revisionist educational line to them. A student said at the criticism meeting: "The teacher only cared about students with good grades. Once, after an exam, the teacher called a student who scored five points and a student who failed to the podium. The teacher asked the student who scored five points: 'How many heads do you have?' Answer: 'One.' Then asked the failing student: 'How many heads do you have?' Answer: 'One.' At this time, the teacher said: 'Both have one head, why did one get five points and the other fail?' These words had a great impact on me, and from then on, I also started to pursue grades desperately. This cannot be blamed on the teacher; it is all because of Chinese Khrushchev's 'intellectual education first' and 'grades as the criterion.' I will definitely overthrow Chinese Khrushchev." A student from a worker's family denounced: "My father is a worker who was exploited and oppressed in the old society and never went to school. He could not help me with my studies. Because Chinese Khrushchev promoted 'intellectual education first' and 'grades as the criterion,' as soon as I entered school, I was looked down upon, considered dirty and stupid, and was placed at the back. But those who dressed well, spoke fluently, and could write and calculate were good students, arranged in the front, valued by people, and never cared about people like me. Today, Chairman Mao led the Cultural Revolution, overthrew Chinese Khrushchev, and I finally have the right to speak!" A student angrily said: "Getting good grades can make you an official, a Young Pioneer, and participate in various school activities. If you don't do well, everything is over, and you can't even go to Tiananmen Square to see Chairman Mao on National Day." Students denounced, teachers exposed, and the crimes of Chinese Khrushchev in promoting the revisionist educational line to harm young people were exposed in broad daylight. Everyone verbally and in writing condemned Chinese Khrushchev. Students themselves chaired the meetings, shouted slogans, and the more they criticized, the more they hated the revisionist educational line, the more they loved the great leader Chairman Mao, and could not help but sing loudly: "The party's kindness is greater than the sky and the earth, parents are not as dear as Chairman Mao." "Long live Chairman Mao forever! Forever!"

Linking revolutionary criticism with the personal experiences of revolutionary teachers and students, the method of criticism, teachers and students reacted visibly, touchably, and effectively. Revolutionary teachers and students, through revolutionary criticism, realized: the revisionist "intellectual education first" and "grades as the criterion" made us see grades in our eyes, think of grades in our hearts, and forget class and class struggle. Chairman Mao pointed out as early as 1939: "Youth should put a firm and correct political direction in the first place." Chinese Khrushchev fiercely resisted Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, and the focus of the two-line struggle on the educational front was on the issue of cultivating what kind of successors. Chinese Khrushchev used the revisionist educational line to compete with the proletariat for the younger generation, using personal gain as bait, leading young people into the mire of bourgeois individualism, and opening the door for him to restore capitalism in China.

Through the revolutionary criticism of "intellectual education first" and "grades as the criterion," Malian Hutong Primary School fully mobilized all revolutionary teachers and students. Criticism drove the resumption of classes and making revolution, enhancing the class struggle consciousness of revolutionary teachers and students. In the revolutionary criticism, Malian Hutong Primary School adopted various forms: school-wide criticism meetings, squad criticism meetings, big-character posters, small-character posters, Red Guards broadcasting station, Red Guards battle reports, cartoons, slide shows, Red Guards art troupe, and performing cultural programs. In addition, they emphasized: combining large and small meetings, with small meetings as the main focus; combining teachers and students, with teachers as the main focus; combining schools and teaching classes, with teaching classes as the main focus; combining oral and written forms, with oral as the main focus. They emphasized that teachers and students should learn, expose, speak, and criticize together. Currently, this school, based on the principle of breaking one and establishing one, breaking while establishing, has broken "intellectual education first" and "grades as the criterion," and established the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people; broken "class head system," and established "squad collective leadership system"; broken "one-man show," and established "many-voiced hall"; broken anarchism, and established new revolutionary discipline. The mass-based revolutionary criticism is sustained and in-depth.

    北京市东城区麻线胡同小学的革命大批判运动开展得扎实深入
    师生一起控诉修正主义教育路线毒害
    本报讯　在无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中，北京市东城区麻线胡同小学革命师生，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决贯彻执行毛主席光辉的“三·七”指示、“五·七”指示和一系列最新指示，在复课闹革命中，掀起了持久的群众性的革命大批判。他们的体会是：要高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，联系实际，有的放矢。用革命的大批判，带动复课闹革命。
    毛主席教导说：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命”。“破字当头，立也就在其中了。”麻线胡同小学革命师生遵照毛主席的教导，始终抓住革命的大批判不放。具体的作法就是联系学校实际，联系革命师生的亲身感受进行革命大批判。
    刚开始进行革命大批判时，教师和学生都有些活思想。有的教师认为，修正主义教育路线对小学的影响不大，没有什么东西可批。高年级教师则怕批判修正主义教育路线会引火烧身。低年级教师认为孩子们刚入学不久，文化水平低，写不出什么东西来。学生呢，觉得修正主义教育路线和自己关系不大。有的说，中国赫鲁晓夫我们没见过，批什么？
    针对这些问题，革命师生在解放军的帮助下反复组织学习了《毛主席论教育革命》。在学习中，大家用毛主席的教育革命思想来对比检查了过去小学教育中的问题，发现小学不是没有修正主义的流毒可批判，而是要批判的东西很多。十八年来，小学教育战线上一直存在着极其尖锐复杂的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。今天批判不批判中国赫鲁晓夫推行的修正主义教育路线是关系到能不能培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人的大问题。
    大批判究竟从何着手？这又是一个矛盾。毛主席说：“进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”毛主席的指示给革命师生指出了进行革命大批判的方向。大家以《毛主席论教育革命》的宝书作为强大的思想武器，以中国赫鲁晓夫推行的修正主义教育路线作为黑靶，掀起了全校持久深入的革命大批判。
    麻线胡同小学的革命大批判，首先从批判“智育第一”“分数挂帅”开始。师生们通过回忆对比，现身说法，把修正主义教育路线在小学的表现摆了出来，批深批透。教师首先以斗私批修为纲，在学生面前带头控诉了修正主义教育路线的毒害，认识到自己过去没有学好毛泽东思想，盲目地推行了修正主义教育路线，在工作中犯了这样或那样的错误。一位教师在批判会上发言说：“过去为了追求分数，甚至不把学生当阶级兄弟看待。整天不是强迫他们写生字，就是做算术。课堂写、回家做。看到学生夏天闷在教室里，汗流满面，胳膊发酸，但小手还在不停地写，我心里也同情他们。可又一想：不让学生下点苦功，怎么能得到好成绩呢？对学习较差的学生抓得就更狠了，晚上经常把他们留到八、九点钟，严重地摧残了学生的身心健康。当时我还认为这是对革命工作负责任呢！真是不知不觉上了中国赫鲁晓夫的当。”有的教师说，修正主义教育路线只要分数，不要阶级斗争，有了分数就有了一切。以分数的高低来衡量学生的好坏，造成了学生之间的不团结；以分数的高低来衡量教师的好坏，造成了教师间的对立。更严重的是，它给学生从小就灌输了肮脏的名利思想，摧残了下一代的健康成长。在教师的带动下，学生们也纷纷起来控诉修正主义教育路线对他们的毒害。一个学生在批判会上说：“老师只看得起成绩好的同学，为了追分数，有一次考试完后，老师把一个得五分的同学和一个不及格的同学叫到讲台前，老师问那个得五分的同学：‘你长几个脑袋？’答：‘一个’。又问不及格的同学：‘你长几个脑袋？’答：‘一个’。这时老师就说：‘都是一个脑袋，怎么人家得五分你不及格呢？’这些话对我刺激很大，从此我也拚命地追起分数来。这不能怪老师，都是中国赫鲁晓夫‘智育第一’‘分数挂帅’造成的。我要坚决打倒中国赫鲁晓夫。”一位工人家庭出身的学生控诉说：“我的父亲是工人，旧社会受剥削受压迫没上过学，学习上不能帮助我。因为中国赫鲁晓夫搞‘智育第一’‘分数挂帅’，所以我一入学就被人看不起，嫌我脏，嫌我笨，把我这个小个放在最后面坐。可是穿的漂亮，说话流利的、能写会算的是好学生，他们被安排在前面，受人重视，一向也没有人理过我这样的人。今天毛主席领导了文化大革命，打倒了中国赫鲁晓夫，我才有了说话的权利！”一位学生气愤地说：“考好分数可以当干部，能当少先队员，还能参加学校组织的各种活动。要是考不好，一切全完了，国庆节更别想去天安门见毛主席了。”学生控诉，教师揭发，把中国赫鲁晓夫推行的修正主义教育路线毒害青少年的罪行暴露在光天化日之下，人人口诛笔伐中国赫鲁晓夫。学生自己主持会，自己喊口号，学生们越批越痛恨修正主义教育路线，越批越热爱伟大领袖毛主席，禁不住高声歌唱：“天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    联系革命师生切身体会进行革命大批判的方法，师生们反应看得见、摸得着、效果好。革命师生们通过革命大批判认识到：修正主义的“智育第一”“分数挂帅”就是让我们眼里看的是分数，心里想的是分数，忘掉阶级和阶级斗争。毛主席早在一九三九年就已明确地指出：“青年应该把坚定正确的政治方向放在第一位”。而中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂地抵制毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，教育战线上的两条路线斗争焦点就集中在培养什么样的接班人的问题上。中国赫鲁晓夫以修正主义教育路线来和无产阶级争夺青少年一代，用名利为诱饵，把青少年引向资产阶级个人主义的泥坑，为他在中国复辟资本主义大开方便之门。
    麻线胡同小学通过对“智育第一”“分数挂帅”的革命大批判，充分发动了全校广大革命师生。大批判带动了复课闹革命，增强了革命师生的阶级斗争的观点。在革命大批判中，麻线胡同小学采取了多种多样的形式：全校批判会、连排批判会、大字报、小字报、红小兵广播站、红小兵战报、漫画、幻灯、红画兵、演出文娱节目等。此外，他们还强调：大会小会相结合，以小会为主；教师学生相结合，以教师为主；学校与教学班相结合，以教学班为主；口头与书面相结合，以口头为主。强调师生一起学、一起摆、一起讲、一起批。目前这个学校本着破一个，立一个，边破边立的原则，破了“智育第一”“分数挂帅”，立了全心全意为人民服务的思想；破了“班主任制”，立了“连队集体领导制”；破了“一言堂”，立了“群言堂”；破了无政府主义，立了革命新纪律。群众性的革命大批判开展得持久、深入。
