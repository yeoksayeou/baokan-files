Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive, the People's Liberation Army is full of fighting spirit and strives for a bumper harvest in agriculture and sideline production this year.

The broad ranks of officers and soldiers, through revolutionary criticism and struggle, have thoroughly smashed the plot of the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan to turn our army into a bourgeois army that is detached from the masses and production labor. They have greatly heightened their awareness of the struggle between the two lines and have launched a high tide of spring farming and production.

New China News Agency, May 3rd: Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive and in the midst of the revolutionary criticism and struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are launching a high tide of spring farming and production with unprecedented fighting spirit. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and strive for a great leap forward and bumper harvest in agriculture and sideline production throughout the army this year.

The great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, has long taught us: The People's Liberation Army is not only a fighting force but also a working force and a production force. In 1966, Chairman Mao issued the brilliant May 7th Directive, pointing out that the People's Liberation Army should be a big school, combining military training, agriculture, industry, and civilian work. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao's great teachings and resolutely struggle against the bourgeois military line advocated by the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan. They have always regarded agriculture and sideline production as one of their regular central tasks and have made progress every year. Last year, the total grain production of the entire army increased by nearly 60% compared to the previous year, and sideline production also achieved great results. More importantly, through participating in agriculture and sideline production, the troops have further promoted the thought revolutionization of the broad ranks of officers and soldiers, achieving tremendous spiritual results.

This year, the entire army, under the great situation of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has made thorough political mobilization to further improve agriculture and sideline production. Many units, before engaging in spring agricultural production, seriously studied Chairman Mao's series of latest directives and the brilliant May 7th Directive, summarizing the experience of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle, and achieving the thought revolutionization of people.

The Guangzhou, Shenyang, Nanjing, Beijing, Jinan, Fuzhou, and Chengdu units all held experience exchange meetings to implement Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive. The attendees widely exchanged their experiences of participating in production, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and highlighting proletarian politics in production struggles. The officers and soldiers of the Guangzhou unit's Tonghu Farm held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive, greatly enhancing their understanding of the great significance of Chairman Mao's brilliant directive. The officers and soldiers of the Nanjing unit's Chengxi Lake Farm and the Shenyang unit's Dedou Farm, before spring plowing, studied Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive, linking it to the struggle between the two lines in our army, and talked extensively about their determination to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's military thought and military line, and to turn the farm into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Many units also carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle, thoroughly settling accounts with the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan, who attempted to abolish the tasks of our army to do mass work and engage in production, turning the people's army into a bourgeois army that is detached from the masses and production labor. Through revolutionary criticism and struggle, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers have greatly heightened their awareness of the struggle between the two lines and are determined to fight and produce to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive and the encouragement of the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the entire army has quickly launched a high tide of spring production. Many units, following Chairman Mao's teachings on "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness," have formulated this year's agriculture and sideline production plans in advance, and have timely and specifically grasped the preparation and spring plowing work. They have based their work on the actual situation of their units, with some strengthening agricultural land construction and others strengthening the management of winter crops. The Guangzhou unit's Niutianyan and other production bases have transplanted seedlings half a month earlier than in previous years. The units in Xinjiang and southern Tibet that participate in production have also sowed seeds a week earlier than in previous years, and the seedlings have grown well. While spring plowing and sowing, many units have reclaimed a large amount of wasteland, expanding the cultivated area. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the Air Force and Naval Air Force units, with the boundless enthusiasm unleashed by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have reclaimed land on the airfield to plant grain and oil crops. Many units have also reclaimed cultivable land in warehouses, camps, vehicle depots, and shooting ranges. Preliminary statistics show that last winter and this spring, various units have reclaimed over 300,000 mu of land by damming the sea and enclosing lakes, and transforming saline-alkali land. The Shenyang unit has expanded its cultivated area by 10% compared to last year due to large-scale reclamation.

In production, various units emphasize the need to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions on "learning from Dazhai in agriculture" and to promote the spirit of Dazhai. The agricultural farm of a certain division of the Shenyang unit has plowed a newly reclaimed area of 10,000 mu nine times and has merged 308 small plots of land into 19 large plots. The frontline island-defending units along the coast have also launched a movement to move soil and create fields.

Various units, in spring farming and production, resolutely implement the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions on "frugal construction of the country" and "thrift for revolution," sparing no effort to save expenses, and repairing and manufacturing agricultural tools and machinery by themselves. The officers and soldiers regard these activities as concrete expressions of their infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao and have achieved great results.

　　在伟大领袖毛主席“五·七”指示的光辉照耀下
　　人民解放军斗志昂扬力争今年全军农副业大丰收
    广大指战员通过革命大批判，彻底粉碎反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿妄图使我军变成脱离群众、脱离生产劳动的资产阶级军队的阴谋，大大提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟，掀起春耕生产高潮
    新华社三日讯　在伟大领袖毛主席“五·七”指示的光辉照耀下，在对中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿的反革命修正主义路线的革命大批判运动中，中国人民解放军广大指战员正以无比高昂的斗志，掀起春耕生产的高潮。广大指战员决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，夺取今年全军农副业生产的大发展，大丰收。
    无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席早就教导我们：人民解放军既是战斗队，又是工作队、生产队。一九六六年，毛主席又发出光辉的“五·七”指示，指出人民解放军应该是一个大学校，把军学、军农、军工、军民这几项兼起来。无限忠于毛主席的人民解放军广大指战员，遵循毛主席的伟大教导，同反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿所推行的资产阶级军事路线作坚决的斗争，一直把农副业生产作为经常的中心任务之一，每年都有所发展，有所提高。去年，全军生产的粮食总产量比前年增长近百分之六十，副业生产也取得了很大成绩。更重要的是，部队通过参加农副业生产，进一步促进了广大指战员的思想革命化，获得了巨大的精神成果。
    今年，全军在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大好形势下，为进一步搞好农副业生产作了充分的政治动员。许多部队在投入春季农业生产以前，认真学习了毛主席的一系列最新指示和光辉的“五·七”指示，总结了在斗争实践中活学活用毛泽东思想，实现人的思想革命化的经验。
    广州、沈阳、南京、北京、济南、福州、成都等部队，都召开了贯彻执行毛主席“五·七”指示的经验交流会，到会人员广泛交流了参加生产的连队，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在生产斗争中突出无产阶级政治的心得体会。广州部队潼湖农场的干部战士大办毛泽东思想学习班，反复学习毛主席的“五·七”指示，大大提高了对毛主席这一光辉指示伟大意义的认识。南京部队城西湖农场、沈阳部队德都农场的指战员，春耕前学习毛主席的“五·七”指示时，联系我军两条路线的斗争，大谈永远忠于毛主席的建军思想和建军路线，把农场办成毛泽东思想大学校的决心。
    许多部队还开展了革命大批判，彻底清算反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿妄图取消我军做群众工作和从事生产的任务，使人民军队变成脱离群众、脱离生产劳动的资产阶级军队的阴谋。广大指战员通过革命大批判，大大提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟，决心为保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而战斗，而生产。
    在毛主席“五·七”指示的光辉照耀下，在无产阶级文化大革命大好形势的鼓舞下，全军迅速掀起了春季生产高潮。许多部队遵照毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的教导，提前订出了今年的农副业生产计划，对备耕和春耕工作抓得及时，抓得具体。他们根据本单位的实际情况，有的大力加强农田基本建设，有的加强越冬作物的管理。广州部队牛田洋等生产基地，比往年提前半个月插上了秧。新疆和西藏南部参加生产的部队，也比往年提早一星期播了种，出苗情况良好。在春耕、春播的同时，许多部队开垦了大量荒地，扩大耕种面积。空军和海军航空兵部队广大指战员，用无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲，在机场空地上开荒种植粮食和油料作物。许多部队还在仓库区、营区、车场、靶场内外，把可耕的土地开垦了出来。据初步统计，去冬今春，各部队拦海围湖、改造盐碱地达三十多万亩。沈阳部队由于大量垦荒，耕地面积比去年扩大了百分之十。
    在生产中，各部队都强调要坚决贯彻毛主席“农业学大寨”的指示，大兴大寨之风。沈阳部队某师农场，把一万亩新开的荒地耙了九遍，并将三百零八块小块土地并成十九块大片土地。沿海前线守岛部队，也掀起了移土造田的热潮。
    各部队在春耕生产中，坚决贯彻伟大领袖毛主席“勤俭建国”“要节约闹革命”的指示精神，千方百计节省开支，自己动手修理和制造农具和农业机械。指战员们把这些活动看成是无限忠于毛主席的具体表现，认真开展，取得了很大成绩。
