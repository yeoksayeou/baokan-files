The Fifth Company of the Ninth Platoon of the Guangzhou Military Region stationed in the Wuzhishan area of Hainan Island, together with the Li ethnic minority community members, firmly remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching: "Never forget class struggle." They have been deeply and persistently engaged in revolutionary criticism. The picture shows Li ethnic minority community member and poor peasant Huang Yuncheng exposing the conspiracy of landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to sabotage the commune revolutionary committee, and fiercely criticizing the "class struggle extinction" theory propagated by China's Khrushchev. Photographed by Wuzhenshao.
