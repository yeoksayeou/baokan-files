Bun Sithath, a member of the Lao People's Liberation Army Command and a standing committee member of the Lao Patriotic Front, recently answered questions from a reporter from the Pathet Lao News Agency. He pointed out the great significance of the victories achieved by the Lao patriotic military and people in the first five months of the dry season from November 1967 to March 1968, during which they annihilated over 11,000 enemy troops. He reaffirmed the determination of the Lao patriotic military and people to fight to the end and defeat the U.S. imperialists.

Bun Sithath pointed out, "The first five months of the dry season were months of great victories for us, and months of great defeat for the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys. Our victories have changed the balance of power in our favor, creating new conditions and bringing our anti-American national salvation struggle to a higher stage. These victories also bring encouragement and confidence to the people of all countries who are fighting against imperialism and colonialism led by the aggressive U.S. imperialists, and for national independence and the defense of world peace."

He mentioned the enemy's heavy losses during this period, noting that the enemy's shortage of troops has become increasingly severe. The puppet army is in disarray. The failure and passivity of the U.S. and puppet forces have become more evident. In contrast, the Lao patriotic military and people's confidence in achieving final victory has never been stronger, and the alliance between the Lao Patriotic Front and the patriotic neutral forces has never been more solid. The liberated areas have been further consolidated, and the prestige of the patriotic forces has been enhanced both domestically and internationally.

Bun Sithath stated that the Lao patriotic military and people will not be complacent or relax their vigilance. They are always prepared to deal with the various evil plots and barbaric actions of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys who are struggling desperately to escape their predicament.

In his speech, Bun Sithath also refuted the recent slanders by Souvanna Phouma against the Lao Patriotic Front and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. He said, "Souvanna Phouma's current slanders against the Lao Patriotic Front and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are merely to prepare public opinion for the Johnson administration's new military adventures in Laos."

Bun Sithath finally stated that as long as the independence and sovereignty of Laos are trampled upon by the U.S. imperialists, and as long as there is a single U.S. aggressor on Lao soil, the Lao people under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front will be determined to fight until they completely defeat the U.S. imperialist aggression and achieve final victory.

According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, the Lao patriotic military and people continued to launch widespread attacks at the end of March and the beginning of April, achieving new victories.

In Khammouane Province, the patriotic military and people in Thakhek District fought from March 25 to 28, annihilating 150 enemy troops, recapturing lost territory, and liberating over 4,000 residents. On March 26, the patriotic military and people in the same province, in a counterattack against the enemy attempting to occupy the liberated area and a mop-up operation, annihilated 150 enemy troops and seized many weapons and military supplies.

On March 28, the guerrilla forces in Dongbang District, Savannakhet Province, shot down a U.S. helicopter with light weapons, killing three American pilots on board.

From April 5 to 14, the patriotic military and people in Saravane, Xieng Khouang, and Xam Neua provinces launched successive attacks on the enemy, killing 44 enemy troops and wounding many more, and seizing many weapons.

On April 8 and 9, the local forces and guerrilla units in Xieng Khouang Province launched consecutive attacks on the enemy, annihilating nearly 70 enemy troops.

　　奔·西巴色指出老挝爱国军民旱季大捷意义重大
　　老挝人民决心战斗到底打败美帝
　　甘蒙、川圹等省军民广泛出击取得新战果
    新华社康开电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝人民解放军指挥部成员、老挝爱国战线党中央委员会常务委员奔·西巴色，最近在答巴特寮通讯社记者的问题时，指出了老挝爱国军民在一九六七年十一月到一九六八年三月旱季头五个月取得歼敌一万一千多名的辉煌胜利的重大意义，重申了老挝爱国军民抗战到底的决心。西巴色指出，“旱季的头五个月，是我们大捷的五个月，是美帝国主义者及其走狗大败的五个月。我们的胜利使力量对比发生了对我们有利的变化，为我们创造了新的条件，使我们的抗美救国的斗争发展到了一个更高的阶段。这些胜利还给现在正在为反对以侵略成性的美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立以及保卫世界和平而斗争的各国人民带来了鼓舞和信心。”
    他谈到敌人在这段时期内的惨重失败时指出，敌人兵力不足的情况变得越来越严重。伪军乱成一团。美伪失败和被动的地位更为明显了。与此相反，老挝爱国军民争取最后胜利的信心从来也没有这样坚强，老挝爱国战线党和爱国中立力量之间的联盟从来也没有这样牢固。解放区得到了进一步巩固。爱国力量的威信在国内外得到了提高。
    西巴色表示，老挝爱国军民决不会自满自足，放松警惕性。他们时刻准备着对付为摆脱困境而垂死挣扎的美帝国主义者及其走狗的种种罪恶阴谋和野蛮行径。
    西巴色在谈话中还驳斥了梭发那·富马最近对老挝爱国战线党和越南民主共和国的诬蔑。他说，富马目前对老挝爱国战线党和越南民主共和国的诽谤，“只不过是为了给约翰逊集团对老挝发动新的军事冒险准备舆论罢了。”
    西巴色最后表示，只要老挝的独立和主权还遭到美帝国主义者的践踏，只要老挝国土上还有一个美国侵略强盗，在老挝爱国战线党领导下的老挝人民，就决心把他们的战斗进行到彻底打败美帝国主义的侵略和取得最后胜利为止。
    据新华社康开电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝爱国军民在三月底和四月初继续广泛出击，取得了新的战果。
    甘蒙省他曲县爱国军民从三月二十五日到二十八日，痛击侵占解放区的敌人，歼灭敌军一百五十名，收复了失地，解放了四千多居民。这个省的爱国军民三月二十六日在反击企图侵占解放区的敌人和剿匪战斗中，消灭敌人一百五十名，缴获许多武器和军用物资。
    沙湾拿吉省东邦县游击队三月二十八日用轻武器击落美国直升飞机一架，飞机上的三名美国飞贼当场毙命。
    沙拉湾、乌多姆塞和桑怒省爱国军民，在四月五日、十日、十二日和十四日四天中，接连袭击敌人，共打死敌人四十四名，打伤多名，并且缴获了许多武器。
    川圹省地方部队和游击队，四月八日和九日接连袭击敌人，消灭敌人近七十名。
