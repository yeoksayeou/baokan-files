The Hyogo Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Left) recently issued a statement warmly supporting Chairman Mao's statement on supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence.

The statement said that the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, recently issued a statement encouraging and calling on American blacks, who are engaged in a fierce struggle against the American monopoly capitalist class, to advance courageously. At the same time, it is a powerful mobilization order for all the people of the world who are fighting against American imperialism. Chairman Mao's statement points out a broad road to complete liberation for all oppressed peoples and nations, and clearly declares that American imperialism is a paper tiger, and the day of its doom is not far off.

The statement said that Chairman Mao pointed out in his statement that American imperialists have not shown any tolerance even to non-violent advocates like Martin Luther King. The ferocious nature of imperialism and all reactionaries will not change until they are destroyed. Their so-called "goodwill" and various deceptions must not be trusted in the slightest, and no illusions should be harbored about them.

The statement said that since last year, a series of anti-American patriotic struggles have unfolded in Japan in places such as Haneda, Sasebo, Sanrizuka, and Waseda, demonstrating the revolutionary power of the Japanese people. The statement continued, saying that the struggle of the Japanese people against American imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital, as well as their accomplices, Soviet modern revisionism and the Miyamoto revisionist clique, is also a part of the global struggle against American imperialism and a part of the contemporary world revolution. The revolutionary people of Japan must, with the spirit of proletarian internationalism, persist in their struggle, vigorously promote Chairman Mao's statement, and mobilize more people across Japan to join the ranks of the anti-American patriotic struggle.

The statement said that the Hyogo Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Left) will, together with the broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and all those who oppose American imperialism, further launch a sustained and fierce offensive against the enemy, support the struggle of American blacks, and fight for the liberation of all the people of the world.

A Latin American friend, while enthusiastically hailing the great leader Chairman Mao's statement on supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence, pointed out that Chairman Mao's words are all truths, and each sentence represents the aspirations and interests of the people of all countries in the world, pointing out the correct path to revolutionary victory for the revolutionary people.

A Chilean university student said that Chairman Mao's statement is not only a great support for the struggle of American blacks but also for all the people of the world who are fighting revolutions and want to bury American imperialism, reactionaries, and their running dogs and accomplices, the revisionists. He said that this statement is extremely important for Chilean revolutionary students because, through studying Chairman Mao's statement, they can better understand what the correct path to victory for the Chilean revolution is.

A Chilean textile worker participating in a strike struggle said, "Chairman Mao's words are all truths. We must do the same as American blacks, and only by using revolutionary violence can we workers seize power."

A newsboy from Santiago said: After reading Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence, I understood that the struggle of American blacks is part of the struggle of all American people to rid themselves of the monopoly capitalist class and capitalist exploiters and to fight for liberation. He said, Chairman Mao's words, like a brilliant sun, illuminated my heart. All of Chairman Mao's works that I have read have made me see things clearly. The revolutionary principles proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong are all applicable to the Chilean revolution.

A Venezuelan friend, after reading Chairman Mao's statement, said that Chairman Mao, in his statement, used simple and profound language to conduct a profound Marxist-Leninist analysis of the current international situation and pointed out a clear path for the struggle of American blacks. He said, Chairman Mao's words are easy to understand, and each sentence represents the aspirations and interests of the people of all countries in the world.

    新华社东京电　日本共产党兵库县委员会（左派）最近发表声明，热烈拥护毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。
    声明说，全世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席最近发表的声明，鼓励和号召正在同美国垄断资产阶级进行激烈斗争的美国黑人奋勇前进，同时也是对正在为反对美帝国主义进行斗争的全世界人民强有力的动员令。毛主席的声明，向全世界一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族，指出了彻底解放的广阔的道路，明确地宣告了美帝国主义是纸老虎，美帝国主义灭亡的日子已经为期不远。
    声明说，毛主席在声明中指出，美帝国主义者对非暴力主义者马丁·路德·金也没有宽容。帝国主义和一切反动派的凶恶本性，直至灭亡是决不会改变的。对它们的所谓“诚意”等种种欺骗，绝不可有丝毫的信赖，更不能抱任何幻想。
    声明说，去年以来，在日本羽田、佐世保、三里塚、王子等地展开的一系列反美爱国斗争，显示了日本人民的革命力量。声明接着说，日本人民反对美帝国主义和日本垄断资本及其帮凶苏联现代修正主义、宫本修正主义集团的斗争，也是全世界人民反对美帝国主义的总斗争的一个组成部分，是当代世界革命的一个组成部分。日本的革命人民，必须以无产阶级国际主义的精神，坚持斗争，大力宣传毛泽东同志的这一声明，在日本各地，发动更广泛的人民参加到反美爱国斗争的行列中来。
    声明说，日本共产党兵库县委员会（左派），要和广大的工人、农民、革命的知识分子以及一切反对美帝国主义的人们一道，进一步向敌人发动持久的猛烈的进攻，声援美国黑人的斗争，为争取全世界人民的解放而斗争。
    新华社十二日讯　拉丁美洲朋友在热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明时指出，毛主席讲的话都是真理，句句都代表着世界各国人民的愿望和利益，给革命人民指出了取得革命胜利的正确道路。
    一位智利大学生说，毛主席的声明，不仅对美国黑人的斗争是一个巨大的支持，而且对世界上所有正在进行革命的、要把美帝国主义、反动派及其走狗和帮凶修正主义者埋葬的各国人民，也是一个支持。他说，这一声明对智利革命学生是极为重要的，因为他们通过学习毛主席的声明，可以更好地弄懂什么是取得智利革命胜利的正确道路。
    一位正在参加罢工斗争的智利纺织女工说：“毛主席说的话都是真理，我们要同美国黑人一样干，只有使用革命的暴力，我们工人才能取得政权。”
    一位圣地亚哥卖报的朋友说：我读了毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明以后，我懂得了，美国黑人这场斗争是所有美国人民为了摆脱垄断资产阶级和资本主义剥削者、争取解放的斗争的一部分。他说，毛主席的话，象灿烂的阳光照亮了我的心。所有我读过的毛主席的著作都使我看得清清楚楚，毛泽东同志提出的所有的革命原则对智利革命都是适用的。
    一位委内瑞拉朋友在读了毛主席的声明后说，毛主席在声明中以深入浅出的语言对当前国际形势进行了深刻的马克思列宁主义的分析，并给美国黑人斗争指出了明确的道路。他说，毛主席的话通俗易懂，句句都代表着世界各国人民的愿望和利益。
