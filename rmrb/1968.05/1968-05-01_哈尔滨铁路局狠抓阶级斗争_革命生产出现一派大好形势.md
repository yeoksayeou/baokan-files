Harbin Railway Bureau Focuses on Class Struggle,
Revolutionary Production Shows Great Leap Forward

The revolutionary cadres and workers of the Harbin Railway Bureau, with hearts full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, have taken class struggle as the key link. In the revolutionary criticism movement, they have launched fierce attacks on class enemies, driving the entire bureau's revolution and production to show a great leap forward. Currently, this railway bureau has fully implemented the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and transportation production is continuously rising.

"Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." In the past, some units could not establish revolutionary committees due to sabotage by class enemies. After the revolutionary cadres and workers grasped class struggle, many problems were solved. There was a marshalling station where the two revolutionary factions had been united for over five months but still could not establish a revolutionary committee. After the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team arrived at the station, they mobilized the masses to use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, uncover the cover of class struggle, expose the bad elements sabotaging the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and quickly established a revolutionary committee. Now, all units under the bureau have established revolutionary committees.

With the continuous improvement of the revolutionary cadres and workers' awareness of class struggle and line struggle, this bureau has further implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." Transportation production is thriving. Good deeds of not fearing hardship, not fearing difficulties, and actively taking on heavy responsibilities are emerging. Since April, the bureau's average daily loading volume has increased by 7% compared to the first quarter, the average daily unloading volume has increased by 5% compared to the first quarter, and the on-time rate of passenger and freight trains has risen to over 90%. Due to fast loading, unloading, marshalling, and running, the turnover time of freight cars has also been shortened compared to the first quarter.

　　哈尔滨铁路局狠抓阶级斗争
    革命生产出现一派大好形势
    哈尔滨铁路局广大革命职工和革命干部，怀着无限忠于毛主席的红心，以阶级斗争为纲，在革命大批判中向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，推动全局革命、生产出现一派大好形势。目前这个铁路局已经全面实现了革命三结合，运输生产不断上升。
      “阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”过去有些单位由于阶级敌人破坏，长期成立不了革委会，广大革命职工狠抓阶级斗争以后，许多问题迎刃而解。有一个编组站，两派革命职工已经联合了五个多月，还没有成立革委会。解放军毛泽东思想宣传队到站后，发动群众以毛主席的最新指示为武器，深入地开展革命大批判，揭开了阶级斗争盖子，揪出了破坏革命三结合的坏人，很快就成立了革委会。现在，全局所属各单位已经全部建立了革委会。
    随着广大革命职工阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟的不断提高，这个局进一步落实了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，运输生产蒸蒸日上。不怕艰苦、不怕困难、主动挑重担的好人好事不断涌现。四月份以来，全局每天平均装车数比第一季度增长百分之七，每天平均卸车数比第一季度增长百分之五，客、货车运行正点率上升到百分之九十以上。由于装车快，卸车快，编得快，跑得快，货车周转时间也比第一季度缩短了。
