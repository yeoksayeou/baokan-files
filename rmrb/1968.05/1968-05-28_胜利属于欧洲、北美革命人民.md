A magnificent student movement and workers' movement is surging in France and across Europe and North America.

This revolutionary storm, which has swept through France and shaken the entire capitalist world, was initiated by young students. Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The student movement is a part of the entire people's movement. The upsurge of the student movement is bound to promote the upsurge of the entire people's movement." The progressive student movements in France and various countries in Europe and North America have powerfully shaken the decadent rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie, inspiring the revolutionary spirit of the working people in Europe and North America.

Under the inspiration of the progressive students' just struggle, the French working class, with its glorious revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune, is now launching political and economic strikes with an irresistible momentum. The heroic struggle of French workers and students has turned the entire country into a "besieged island." Their daring spirit of revolution and rebellion has struck fear into the hearts of the monopoly capitalist clique, making modern revisionist traitors squirm. All this shows: the combination of the student movement and the workers' movement is a revolutionary path, a path to victory. Workers and students supporting each other and fighting side by side can more broadly unite all progressive forces, forming a mighty revolutionary army. This will enable them to more timely expose and unmask the shameful faces of a handful of traitors and scabs, and launch a sustained and fierce attack on the reactionary rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie. They will certainly advance from victory to greater victory.

We, the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the people in Europe and North America, and firmly support the struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. We stand heart to heart with the revolutionary people of Europe and North America, and with all revolutionary people around the world. We are convinced that the working class and the broad masses of the people in Europe and North America, united with the great revolutionary people of the world, will, through sustained struggle, accelerate the collapse of the capitalist and imperialist system.

    胜利属于欧洲、北美革命人民

    一个波澜壮阔的学生运动和工人运动正在法国和欧洲、北美各国蓬勃兴起。
    这次席卷法国、震撼整个资本主义世界的革命风暴的兴起，是青年学生打头阵的。我们伟大导师毛主席指出：“学生运动是整个人民运动的一部分。学生运动的高涨，不可避免地要促进整个人民运动的高涨。”法国和欧洲、北美各国的进步学生运动，有力地冲击着垄断资产阶级的腐朽统治，激发了欧洲、北美各国劳动人民的革命斗志。
    在进步学生的正义斗争的鼓舞下，具有巴黎公社光荣革命传统的法国工人阶级，正以排山倒海之势，展开政治和经济大罢工。法国工人和学生的英勇斗争使整个法国成了个“被围困的孤岛”。他们敢于革命、敢于造反的战斗精神，把垄断资本集团吓得心惊胆颤，使现代修正主义叛徒如坐针毡。所有这一切表明：学生运动和工人运动相结合，是一条革命的道路，一条胜利的道路。工人和学生互相支持，并肩战斗，就能够更加广泛地团结一切进步力量，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，就能够更加及时地识破和揭穿一小撮工贼和叛徒的可耻嘴脸，就能够更加有力地向垄断资产阶级的反动统治发起持久的、猛烈的进攻，就一定能够从胜利走向更大的胜利。
    我们中国人民解放军战士坚决支持欧洲、北美各国人民的革命斗争，坚决支持全世界一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争。我们和欧洲、北美革命人民心连心，和全世界革命人民心连心。我们深信，欧洲、北美的工人阶级和广大人民群众同全世界广大革命人民联合起来，坚持持久的战斗，必将加速资本主义和帝国主义制度的崩溃。
