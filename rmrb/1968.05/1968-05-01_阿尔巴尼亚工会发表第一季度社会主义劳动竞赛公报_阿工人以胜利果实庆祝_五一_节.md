Albanian Trade Unions Release First Quarter Socialist Labor Competition Bulletin

Albanian Workers Celebrate "May Day" with Victory Fruits

NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, TIRANA, April 30 — The Central Council of the Albanian Trade Unions issued a bulletin on the first quarter of this year's socialist labor competition today, stating that the Albanian working people are celebrating the May Day International Labor Day with the rich fruits of victory achieved by implementing the historic resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor.

The bulletin said that the documents of the Party of Labor and Comrade Enver Hoxha's programmatic speech on February 6 last year have raised the fighting spirit and socialist consciousness of the Albanian working class and the broad masses of laborers to a higher level.

The bulletin said that the Albanian working class and all the people are united around the Party of Labor and the Central Committee of the Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, holding high the red flag of revolution, socialist construction, and defense of the motherland, and are ready for the May Day inspection.

The bulletin said, "Race against time, increase industrial and agricultural production rates, strive to electrify Albania in four years, strengthen national defense," these are our slogans. In the struggle to realize these slogans, new people nurtured with socialist thought and the Marxist-Leninist worldview are growing up.

The bulletin listed some regions and units that have achieved outstanding results in the first quarter of this year's socialist labor competition.

The bulletin called on the working class to study and master Marxism-Leninism, always stand in the forefront of the struggle, and gloriously complete the tasks set by the Party for 1968.

The bulletin also called on the workers of state farms to mobilize all forces to complete the spring sowing tasks ahead of schedule.
