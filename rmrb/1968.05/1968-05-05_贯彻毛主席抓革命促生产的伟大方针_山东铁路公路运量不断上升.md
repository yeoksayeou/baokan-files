	Implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of combining revolution with production, the transportation volume in Shandong's railways and highways continues to rise.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, May 3rd: The broad revolutionary cadres of Shandong Province's transportation sector have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further implementing and executing Chairman Mao's great policy of "combining revolution with production." This has resulted in a very good situation for both revolution and production. Currently, the entire transportation sector in Shandong Province has fully achieved revolutionary unity, and the vast majority of units have established revolutionary committees. The transportation volume of railways and highways continues to rise, and many important material transportation tasks have been completed ahead of schedule.

	The most outstanding feature of the good revolutionary and production situation in Shandong Province's transportation sector is that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has been widely promoted to an unprecedented extent. Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions have been swiftly implemented among the broad revolutionary cadres and their families. The revolutionary cadres have followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "holding study sessions is a good method; many problems can be solved in study sessions," and have organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study sessions. To date, more than 50,000 cadres have participated in these study sessions. The automobile transportation companies in Yantai, Heze, and Jining have, to ensure safety, specifically studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles" and teachings related to the mass line and strengthening the mass perspective in the Mao Zedong Thought study sessions. This has strengthened their consciousness of driving for the revolution and for the people, and has heightened their vigilance. At the same time, the revolutionary cadres have used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle, angrily criticizing the revisionist goods such as "material incentives" and "bonus system" promoted by China's Khrushchev, and have eliminated their poisonous influence.

	The broad revolutionary cadres of Shandong Province's transportation sector have directed the boundless enthusiasm released during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production, making transportation production continuously rise. The revolutionary cadres of the railway sector, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, have actively collaborated closely with the material and transportation sectors, not only ensuring the timely transportation of steel, grain, and various agricultural support materials but also continuously improving the cargo volume and loading, unloading, and transportation efficiency month by month. In particular, the transportation volume of coal has exceeded the original plan by 67,000 tons in the first quarter, basically achieving the goal of transporting as much as the mines produce. The broad revolutionary cadres of the entire province's highway transportation system have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor in developing the national economy, placing the transportation of agricultural support materials in the first position. In the first four months, nearly 500,000 tons of agricultural support materials have been transported, achieving the goal of transporting as soon as they arrive, safely and timely. The highway transportation plan for the first four months has also been completed ahead of schedule. In completing the transportation tasks, the broad revolutionary cadres of Shandong Province's transportation sector have also raised high the banner of revolutionary criticism and struggle, thoroughly criticizing the revisionist line, reforming some old unreasonable regulations, and creating a good form of joint transportation service between the transportation and banking sectors.

    山东铁路公路运量不断上升
    据新华社济南三日电　山东省交通运输战线广大革命职工，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，进一步贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，使革命、生产出现了一派大好形势。目前，山东省整个交通运输战线，已经全面实现了革命大联合，绝大部分单位建立了革命委员会。铁路和公路的运输量不断上升，许多重要物资的运输任务都已超额完成。
    山东省交通运输战线革命和生产形势大好的最突出特点，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想得到了空前大普及，毛主席的一系列最新指示，在广大革命职工和家属中迅速得到落实。广大革命职工遵循毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的伟大教导，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，到目前为止，参加学习的职工达五万多人。烟台、菏泽、济宁等地汽车运输公司，为了保障安全，在毛泽东思想学习班里，专门学习了毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”和有关群众路线、增强群众观点等方面的教导，加强了为革命、为人民开车的思想，提高了警惕性。同时，革命职工还以毛泽东思想为武器，开展革命大批判，愤怒地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“物质刺激”、“奖金挂帅”等修正主义黑货，并肃清其流毒。
    山东省交通运输战线的广大革命职工把无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲用到生产中去，使运输生产节节上升。铁路部门广大革命职工，在毛泽东思想的指引下，主动同物资、交通部门密切协作，不仅保证了钢铁、粮食和各种支农物资的及时运输，而且货运量和装卸、运输效率逐月提高，特别是煤炭的运输量，仅第一季度就比原计划超过六万七千吨，基本上做到了煤矿生产多少，就运多少。全省公路运输系统广大革命职工，坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的以农业为基础，以工业为主导的发展国民经济的总方针，把运输支援农业物资放在第一位，今年头四个月共运输支农物资近五百万吨，做到随到随运，安全及时。一至四月份的公路运输计划也已超额完成。山东省交通运输部门广大革命职工在完成运输任务中，还高举革命大批判的旗帜，彻底批判修正主义路线，改革一些旧的不合理的规章制度，创建了各运输部门和银行部门联合运输服务的好形式。
