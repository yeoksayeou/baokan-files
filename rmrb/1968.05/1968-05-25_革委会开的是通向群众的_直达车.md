Editor's Note: Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out more than a year ago with far-sighted vision: "In places and units where power needs to be seized, the policy of revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' must be implemented, and a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat must be established. This power organ is best named the Revolutionary Committee." The Revolutionary Committee, which consists of a "three-in-one combination," is a great innovation by the Chinese proletariat and the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses in the process of seizing power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. More than a year of practice has proven: The Revolutionary Committee, under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, is a new power organ that better meets the needs of the socialist economic base and better meets the needs of consolidating the proletarian dictatorship and preventing capitalist restoration.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "The basic experience of the Revolutionary Committee has three points: one is the representation of revolutionary cadres, one is the representation of the military, and one is the representation of revolutionary masses, realizing the revolutionary 'three-in-one combination.' The Revolutionary Committee should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organs, streamline administration, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses."

This "three-in-one combination" Revolutionary Committee maintains extensive and close ties with the people, making our proletarian power deeply rooted among the masses. It further strengthens the unity between the military and the people, between military and political affairs, and between cadres and the masses, and strengthens the proletarian dictatorship. This "three-in-one combination" Revolutionary Committee takes loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as its highest requirement. In this way, the Revolutionary Committee becomes a revolutionary, authoritative, closely connected with the masses, and vigorous power organ, becoming a command center that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlights proletarian politics, and is full of revolutionary vigor.

To fully reflect the new appearance of the Revolutionary Committee, we have launched the column "The Revolutionary Committee is Good," welcoming contributions and letters from a wide range of readers to jointly run this column.

The Revolutionary Committee is a "Direct Line" to the Masses
Vice Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee, Geng Changsuo

Our great leader Chairman Mao highly praises the "three-in-one combination" Revolutionary Committee as a creation by the working class and the people in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao pointed out: "The basic experience of the Revolutionary Committee has three points: one is the representation of revolutionary cadres, one is the representation of the military, and one is the representation of revolutionary masses, realizing the revolutionary 'three-in-one combination.'" As a member of the Revolutionary Committee, I deeply feel that the Revolutionary Committee is good! Implementing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" with the participation of representatives of the revolutionary masses is good!

The question of who holds power is too important. Since the founding of the country, I often go to Beijing for meetings, and to the province for meetings. The great teacher and great leader Chairman Mao cares deeply for us workers. However, when meetings are presided over by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, led by China's Khrushchev, people like us with calloused hands and cow dung on our feet often do not have a say. In 1951, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Wugong Village, Raoyang County, responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "organize," and had been on the path of collectivization for eight years. I went to Beijing for a meeting. The person presiding over the meeting, following the instructions of China's Khrushchev, said nonsense like "agricultural cooperatives are not the direction of development. In the future, when developing socialism, cooperatives will also be dissolved." Hearing this, my head buzzed, and I thought: Our agricultural cooperative—shared land—is clearly doing very well, why should it be dissolved? At that time, I couldn't eat or sleep. I had a lot to say, but they didn't let me speak, didn't listen to me.

We listen to Chairman Mao's words, not theirs. We continued on the path of collectivization. In 1961, I went to Beijing for another meeting. The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party again had me represent the peasants and propose implementing a distribution method of greatly promoting material incentives. I expressed a different opinion, which did not suit their intentions, and later they didn't even let me attend the meetings. In their eyes, we are rough and uneducated, without ability or brains. But we may not have other abilities, but we have an unlimited love for Chairman Mao; we may not have other brains, but we listen to Chairman Mao's words and resolutely follow the socialist path.

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao led us to overthrow the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, led by China's Khrushchev, and seize their power. Revolutionary Committees, this new power organ, were established one after another in various places. With such a wise and great leader at the helm and backing us up, we are truly fortunate.

The revolutionary masses love Chairman Mao the most. Chairman Mao trusts and relies on the revolutionary masses the most. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most fundamental aspect of reforming state organs is to connect with the masses." With the participation of representatives of the revolutionary masses, the Revolutionary Committee has a foundation. Revolutionary mass representatives come from various places and fronts, old and young, those who wield hoes and those who wield axes. They live among the masses and fight on the front lines. Such "officials" do not need to go elsewhere to conduct investigations; their own work units are an endless source of experience. In the past, there were so many people in the province and county, with such a large organizational structure. The situation below was reported level by level, and the instructions above were transmitted level by level, which was too inefficient. Now, the Revolutionary Committee operates a "direct line," through the bridging role of mass representatives, directly connecting with the masses from all directions and blocks.

Since I was elected as the vice chairman of the provincial Revolutionary Committee, the masses often come to me to report situations and discuss issues. I gather these situations and issues and report them to the standing committee members of the provincial, prefectural, and county Revolutionary Committees in a timely manner. During meetings, I bring these opinions up for discussion, formulate resolutions in line with Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and then go back to implement them. Usually, we think about the team's affairs and the province's affairs; we go down to the lower levels and also go up to the higher levels; we are both "officials" and community members; we are both students and teachers. It is truly as Chairman Mao said, "from the masses, to the masses"!

With the participation of mass representatives, the Revolutionary Committee can also more effectively implement bottom-up revolutionary supervision. Each of us workers and poor and lower-middle peasants has an account of blood and tears from the old society, hating the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party who want us to suffer again. We hold power with class hatred, never forgetting class struggle. We bring this class sentiment into the Revolutionary Committee and supervise the Revolutionary Committee. Everyone uses Mao Zedong Thought as a measure; whatever is in line with Mao Zedong Thought, we support and implement; whatever is not in line with Mao Zedong Thought, we oppose and resist. We represent the masses to supervise the Revolutionary Committee; when we return to the team, we are also supervised by the poor and lower-middle peasants. In this way, we can ensure that our ironclad socialist state will never change color.

### 革委会开的是通向群众的“直达车”

专栏：

    编者按：我们的伟大领袖毛主席早在一年多以前就高瞻远瞩地指出：“在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的‘三结合’的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。这个权力机构的名称，叫革命委员会好。”“三结合”的革命委员会，是我国无产阶级和亿万革命群众向党内一小撮走资派进行夺权斗争过程中的一个伟大创举。一年多来的实践证明：革命委员会是在无产阶级专政条件下，更加适应社会主义经济基础的需要，更加适应巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的需要的新的权力机构。
    毛主席最近又指出：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”
    这种“三结合”的革命委员会，同人民群众保持着广泛的、密切的联系，使我们的无产阶级政权，深深地扎根于群众之中。它进一步加强了军民的团结，军政的团结，干群的团结，强化了无产阶级专政。这种“三结合”的革命委员会，把忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，做为对自己的最高要求。这样，就使革命委员会成为革命的、有无产阶级权威的、密切联系群众的、朝气蓬勃的权力机构，成为高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，充满革命干劲的战斗指挥部。
    为了充分地反映革命委员会的崭新面貌，我们开辟了《革命委员会好》这个专栏，欢迎广大读者多多来稿来信，以便共同办好这个专栏。
    革委会开的是通向群众的“直达车”
    河北省革命委员会副主任　耿长锁
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席高度赞扬“三结合”的革命委员会，是工人阶级和人民群众在这次文化大革命中的一种创造。毛主席指出：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。”我作为革命委员会的成员，深深体会到革命委员会就是好！实行革命三结合，有革命群众代表参加，就是好！
    政权掌握在谁手里，这个问题太重要了。建国以来，我经常到北京开会，到省里开会。伟大的导师、伟大的领袖毛主席对我们劳动人民非常关怀。可是，碰到以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派主持会议的时候，象我们这些手上有老茧、脚下踩牛粪的人，说话往往不占地方。一九五一年，我们饶阳县五公村的贫下中农响应毛主席“组织起来”的伟大号召，走上集体化道路八个年头的时候，我上北京开会。主持会议的人，秉承中国赫鲁晓夫的意旨，胡说什么“农业合作社不是发展方向。将来发展社会主义，合作社也要解散。”听了这话，我的脑袋“轰”的一声，心想：我们的农业合作社——土地合伙，明明办得很好，为什么要解散呢？当时，我饭也吃不下，觉也睡不着。心里有一肚子话要说，可是他们不让我说，不听我说。
    我们听毛主席的话，不听他们那一套。回来照样走集体化的道路。一九六一年，我又上北京开会。党内一小撮走资派又让我代表农民，提出实行大搞物质刺激的分配办法。我提出了不同的看法，很不合他们的心意，以后连会都不让我参加了。在他们眼里，我们是大老粗，没水平，没心眼。可是，我们别的水平没有，但是无限热爱毛主席；别的心眼没有，但是听毛主席的话，坚决走社会主义道路。
    在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，毛主席领导我们造了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派的反，夺了他们的权。各地先后建立了革命委员会这一新生的权力机构。我们有这样英明伟大的领袖给掌舵、撑腰，真是太幸福了。
    革命群众最热爱毛主席。毛主席他老人家最相信革命群众，最依靠革命群众。毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”革命委员会有了革命群众代表参加，就有了根基。革命群众代表来自各个地方，各条战线，有老年，有青年，有拿锄的，有拿斧的。他们生活在群众中，战斗在最前线。这样的“官”，不用到别处去蹲点，自己的工作单位就是一个解剖不完的麻雀，就有总结不完的经验。过去省里、县里那么多人，组织机构那么庞大，下面的情况，一级一级地汇报，上面的指示，一级一级地传达，太不灵通了。现在革委会开的是“直达车”，通过群众代表的桥梁作用，四面八方，条条块块，直接和群众联系着。
    我自从当选了省革命委员会副主任后，群众经常找我反映情况，谈问题。我把这些情况和问题集中起来，及时汇报给省、专、县革委会驻会的常委们。开会的时候，把意见带上去，参加讨论，制定出符合毛主席无产阶级革命路线的决议，然后再回去贯彻执行。平时，我们既想着队里的事，又想着全省的事；既走下面，也走上面；既当“官”，又当社员；既当学生，又当先生。真是如毛主席说的“从群众中来，到群众中去”啊！
    革命委员会有了群众代表，还可以更有效地实行自下而上的革命监督。我们每一个工人，每一个贫下中农，都有一本旧社会的血泪账，恨透了想让我们再受二遍苦的党内一小撮走资派。我们带着阶级仇恨掌权，念念不忘阶级斗争。我们把这种阶级感情带进革命委员会，监督革命委员会。大家以毛泽东思想作尺子，凡是符合毛泽东思想的事，我们就拥护、支持、照办；凡是不符合毛泽东思想的事，我们就反对、抵制。我们代表群众去监督革命委员会；回到队里，又受贫下中农的监督。这样，就能保证我们铁打的社会主义江山永不变色。
