The nation's military and civilians warmly celebrate Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's personal approval of the honor bestowed upon Comrade Men He, resolving to learn from Comrade Men He.

Everything for Chairman Mao, everything to follow Chairman Mao, everything for Chairman Mao.

The military and civilians of the nation have expressed: We will resolutely carry out the orders of the Central Committee, learn from Comrade Men He's unyielding loyalty to the people, the Party, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher. We will actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, further enhance our class struggle and line struggle consciousness, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 28th, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin personally approved, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group issued an order, posthumously awarding Comrade Men He the honorable title of "a good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." This has greatly inspired the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres across the country. Revolutionary masses and cadres across the country have expressed their boundless excitement, saying that in the unprecedentedly good situation where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin have set a shining example for us of a Party cadre continuing the revolution under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is the greatest concern, the greatest education, the greatest inspiration, and the greatest encouragement for the revolutionary masses and cadres across the country. They repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" They expressed their determination to resolutely carry out the orders of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, learn from Comrade Men He's unyielding loyalty to the people, the Party, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, learn from Comrade Men He's revolutionary spirit of resolutely executing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, further enhance class struggle and line struggle consciousness, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Today, revolutionary masses and cadres across the country, with profound proletarian feelings of infinite loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, have repeatedly listened to the order personally approved by Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, and issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group. The revolutionary masses, with the highest enthusiasm and the fastest speed, immediately launched a mass movement across the country to vigorously propagate and learn from Comrade Men He, "a good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." Revolutionary masses and cadres across the country have held sit-in meetings, discussion meetings, and oath-taking meetings to learn from Comrade Men He's glorious deeds. Many grassroots units have begun to set up special Mao Zedong Thought study classes to learn from Comrade Men He's advanced deeds; many units' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams have rehearsed artistic performances praising Comrade Men He to propagate to the masses. Many provincial, municipal, and autonomous region revolutionary committees and revolutionary committee preparatory groups have held meetings of standing committee members, expanded meetings of standing committee members, or plenary meetings of committee members today, conveying the orders of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and learning and propagating Comrade Men He's glorious deeds; some provinces and autonomous regions have held mass meetings of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of people. The place where Comrade Men He served, Qinghai Province, is in a state of joy today. More than ten thousand revolutionary masses in Xining City held a parade. The revolutionary workers of the support-left unit where Comrade Men He served, Baqiang Farm, and the members of the mountain city brigade of Donghe Commune, Mutu Autonomous County, where Comrade Men He participated in the "Four Cleanups," held oath-taking meetings to learn from Comrade Men He today. Comrades who were rescued by Comrade Men He expressed their determination to take Comrade Men He as an example, better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, inherit Comrade Men He's will, learn from the hero's thoughts, walk the hero's path, create heroic achievements, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. The hometown of Comrade Men He, Laiyuan County, Hebei Province, has already carried out various activities to learn from Comrade Men He, and they are determined to take Comrade Men He as an example and push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage.

Revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary masses across the country have said that at this crucial moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin posthumously awarded Comrade Men He the honorable title of "a good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line" and issued a call to learn from Comrade Men He. This is a major event in the political life of the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the country. Comrade Men He is a great communist warrior nurtured by great Mao Zedong Thought. His glorious life has fulfilled his oath: everything for Chairman Mao, everything to follow Chairman Mao, everything for Chairman Mao. Revolutionary masses and cadres have pointed out that learning from Comrade Men He is of great significance in promoting the ideological revolutionization of the people of the country and cultivating tens of thousands of revolutionary successors who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, like Comrade Men He.

Revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary masses across the country have emphasized in learning from Comrade Men He's glorious deeds that the People's Liberation Army is a great people's army personally created and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. It is a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Under the nurturing of great Mao Zedong Thought, the People's Liberation Army has produced countless good soldiers and cadres who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. Comrade Men He's heroic deeds have set a shining example for the revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary masses across the country to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Revolutionary masses and cadres have expressed their determination to be like Comrade Men He, everything for Chairman Mao, everything to follow Chairman Mao, everything for Chairman Mao, and in the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, constantly use the "four everything" to examine oneself, and forever follow Chairman Mao to make the revolution. More than a thousand representatives attending the experience exchange meeting of the Gansu Provincial Mao Zedong Thought Study Class have expressed their determination to take Comrade Men He as an example, regard studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought as the first need of their lives, and push the great mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. The famous active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Gu Atao, said: Learning from Comrade Men He, the most fundamental thing is to learn from his heartfelt loyalty to Chairman Mao and his firm grasp of Mao Zedong Thought. Learn from him to always use the "Three Articles" as a measure, achieve one second without "loyalty," one moment without "public," and forever follow the public path illuminated by the "Three Articles"!

Many members of the revolutionary committees, grassroots leaders, and revolutionary masses have expressed that learning from Comrade Men He means remembering Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," firmly grasp class struggle and line struggle, carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, and actively and unceasingly launch fierce attacks on the class enemy. At the meetings held by the Tianjin Revolutionary Committee and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee today, many comrades expressed that learning from Comrade Men He's glorious deeds means first of all remembering class struggle, leading the revolutionary masses to actively and unceasingly launch fierce attacks on a handful of class enemies. Jia Chenglan, the brigade leader of Dazhai Brigade in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, and Liang Bianliang, the deputy secretary of the Party branch, said, we must be like Comrade Men He, with red hearts for Chairman Mao, build the Party branch of Dazhai Brigade into a strong fortress that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, lead the revolutionary masses to always stand guard, keep watch, charge, and fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and fiercely and unceasingly strike the class enemy. The revolutionary workers of the Beijing New China Printing Factory have expressed their determination to take Comrade Men He as an example, strive to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, in the sharp and complex class struggle, remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party," in the struggle against the enemy, strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, unite with all those who can be united, and accurately and fiercely strike a handful of class enemies.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental thing, is to connect with the masses." Revolutionary cadres of various levels of revolutionary committees, in learning from Comrade Men He's glorious deeds, have emphasized the need to be like Comrade Men He, wholeheartedly serve the people, closely connect with the masses, and build the revolutionary committee into a revolutionary and mass-connected leading cadre. Vice Chairman of the Liaoning Revolutionary Committee, Wei Fengying, said, I will take Comrade Men He's noble qualities as a mirror, learn from him meticulously, be like him, infinitely loyal to the people, the Party, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, forever maintain the frugal and simple nature of the working people, always be with the masses, wholeheartedly serve the people, and be a good servant of the people. At the meeting held by the Shanghai Port Bureau's Seventh Loading and Unloading Area Revolutionary Committee, Chairman Yu Xingzhou expressed his determination to be like Comrade Men He, resolutely execute and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, always believe in the masses, rely on the masses, respect the masses' pioneering spirit, and forever be a student of the revolutionary masses. Li Mingyue, the chairman of the Wuhan Chemical Factory Revolutionary Committee, contrasted Comrade Men He's glorious life with his own. He expressed his determination to learn well from Comrade Men He, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, always maintain the frugal and simple nature of the working people, and contribute all his strength to building the revolutionary committee into a revolutionary and mass-connected leading cadre.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 28th, our most beloved great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin personally approved, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group issued an order, posthumously awarding Comrade Men He the honorable title of "a good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." This has greatly inspired the broad cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army. The heroic soldiers and fighters of the army, navy, and air force warmly acclaim the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao, who, at this important moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has set a shining example for us of a good Party cadre continuing the revolution under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat. They warmly acclaim the appearance of a great hero who is infinitely loyal to the Party, the people, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the heroic era of Mao Zedong.

The broad cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army who are infinitely loyal to the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao have pointed out that at this crucial moment when the revolutionary masses and cadres across the country are closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin posthumously awarded Comrade Men He the honorable title of "a good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." This is a major event in the political life of the entire Party, the entire army, and the revolutionary people of the country. Comrade Men He is a proletarian revolutionary hero who has always, resolutely, and consciously fought to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. He is a prominent representative of advanced elements who continue the revolution under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must seriously learn from Comrade Men He's noble qualities of "everything for Chairman Mao, everything to follow Chairman Mao, everything for Chairman Mao, and everything for Chairman Mao," actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, constantly enhance line struggle consciousness, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, better carry out "support the army and love the people" activities, and in the great struggle to execute and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, create new merits for the people.

Today, the barracks of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing are in a state of joy. The General Staff, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, the National Defense Industry Office, various military branches, the Beijing Military Region, and the Beijing Garrison Command have held meetings to warmly acclaim the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin personally approving the awarding of the honorable title to Comrade Men He. They warmly acclaim: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" The leaders of various units have attended the meetings and spoken at the meetings, requiring the broad cadres and fighters of the units to carry out the orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin with the greatest determination, the highest enthusiasm, and the fastest actions, and quickly launch a wave of learning from Comrade Men He. At the ten-thousand-people meeting held by the General Logistics Department, the good soldier of Chairman Mao, Nian Siyang, said with great emotion: "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The shining example of Comrade Men He that you have set for us will forever inspire us to advance on the road of ideological revolutionization!" The soldiers and fighters of the Beijing Army guarding day and night around the great leader Chairman Mao have formed teams of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, gone to the streets and squares, and to factories, mines, villages, and units to widely propagate the central orders; some have used wall newspapers, blackboard newspapers, broadcasts, and performances to vigorously propagate Comrade Men He's noble qualities. Soldiers and fighters have held sit-in meetings to express their determination to learn from Comrade Men He.

The broad cadres and fighters of the units where Comrade Men He served and the units stationed in his hometown are even more joyful upon hearing the great news of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin personally approving the awarding of the honorable title to Comrade Men He. The news reached the Qinghai Plateau, and countless cadres and fighters and tens of thousands of revolutionary masses went to the Qinghai Provincial Military Region to celebrate. The news reached the Gobi Desert, and the soldiers and fighters of the unit where Comrade Men He once served as the political instructor, the Fifth Company of a certain unit, stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait at dawn, solemnly vowing: "Chairman Mao!

We will forever be loyal to your revolutionary line and your great thought! Follow you to make the revolution forever." The news reached the unit where Comrade Men He once worked for many years in Tianjin, and the broad cadres and fighters repeatedly sang "The Boat Sails with the Helmsman" and shouted "The invincible Mao Zedong Thought, long live!" The comrades-in-arms of Comrade Men He, Deputy Battalion Commander Su Minghai, and many others, with hearts full of excitement, recalled and praised the hero, firmly expressing their determination to learn better in the army-wide learning from Comrade Men He.

Many units' leaders have gone to the companies, airports, ships, and frontline positions to read the central order to the broad cadres and fighters. Many units have also sent Comrade Men He's heroic deeds propaganda teams to the city streets, border defense, island outposts, and vast rural areas to propagate. The comrades of the Party Committee of the Artillery Corps of the Nanjing Army who study Chairman Mao's works and many old soldiers who have followed Chairman Mao in numerous battles for decades have expressed their determination in the study to take Comrade Men He as a shining example, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and be a firm revolutionary fighter who stands guard, keeps watch, charges, and fights for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for life.
