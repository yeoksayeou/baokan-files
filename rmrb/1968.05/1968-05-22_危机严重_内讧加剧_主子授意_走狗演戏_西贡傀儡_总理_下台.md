In the face of increasingly severe military, political, and economic crises confronting the U.S. puppet regime, and with internal contradictions within the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky puppet clique becoming ever more acute, the puppet "prime minister" of Saigon, Nguyen Van Huong, announced his resignation on the 18th.

The recent dismissal of the defeated general Westmoreland and now the resignation of Nguyen Van Huong reflect the desperate plight of the U.S. aggressors in South Vietnam. Western news agencies have revealed that this farce of a cabinet reshuffle in Saigon was directly orchestrated by the U.S. "ambassador" to Saigon, Bunker. The aim is to attempt to alleviate the crisis of the Saigon puppet regime through such means, in order to accelerate the military adventurism and political deception schemes of the U.S. aggressors. However, Western public opinion points out that the result of the U.S. aggressors doing this will only exacerbate the "instability" of the Saigon puppet regime.

The resignation of Nguyen Van Huong is also a reflection of the intensifying power struggle between the two lackeys of the U.S., Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky. The open and covert struggles between Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky have always been fierce, with both sides vying to eliminate rivals and install their own loyalists. Therefore, when Nguyen Van Huong, who has the support of Nguyen Cao Ky, submitted his "resignation," Nguyen Van Thieu immediately ordered his loyalist Tran Van Huong to cobble together a new puppet cabinet, in order to expand his own influence. Western news agencies are concerned that the "widening rift" between these two lackeys may cause their sharp contradictions to "surface."

    危机严重  内讧加剧  主子授意  走狗演戏
    西贡傀儡“总理”下台
    新华社二十日讯　西贡消息：在美伪集团面临日益严重的军事、政治、经济危机，阮文绍—阮高其傀儡集团内部矛盾日益加剧的情况下，西贡傀儡政权伪“总理”阮文禄在十八日宣告下台。
    不久前败将威斯特摩兰的被撤换和这次阮文禄的下台，反映了美国侵略者在南越走投无路的困境。西方通讯社透露，由美国驻西贡“大使”邦克直接导演的这幕伪内阁更迭丑剧，其目的是妄图用这种办法来缓和西贡傀儡政权的危机，以加紧推行美国侵略者的军事冒险和政治欺骗阴谋。但西方舆论指出，美国侵略者这样做的结果，必将加剧西贡傀儡政权的“不稳”。
    阮文禄的下台，也是美国的两条走狗阮文绍和阮高其之间争权夺利斗争尖锐化的反映。阮文绍和阮高其之间的明争暗斗一直很激烈，双方都竭力排斥异己，安插亲信，因此，当得到阮高其支持的阮文禄提出“辞职”后，阮文绍立即下令他的亲信陈文香拼凑一个新的傀儡内阁班子，以扩大自己的势力。西方通讯社担心，这两个走狗之间“日益扩大的裂痕”，可能使他们之间的尖锐矛盾“变得表面化”。
