The New China News Agency reported on the 21st that today, more than half a million workers, Red Guards, revolutionary teachers and students, and revolutionary cadres in the capital, amidst the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, brimming with proletarian revolutionary enthusiasm, held a grand parade and demonstration. They resolutely support the just struggles of the Parisian workers, students, and the revolutionary people of all France, and resolutely support the just struggles of the people of Europe and North America.

The parading and demonstrating masses highly praised the progressive student movements in Europe and North America, which are gradually merging with the workers' movements, showing great strength. The rise of the people's movements in these regions has shaken the reactionary rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie led by the United States. Revolutionary masses pointed out that the new surge in the people's movements in Europe and North America is a prominent sign of the excellent situation of world revolution.

The surging people's movements in the heart of the capitalist world have dealt a new and powerful blow to the imperialists led by the United States, the Soviet revisionist traitors, and the reactionaries of all countries. It has greatly encouraged and supported the revolutionary people of all countries and the broad revolutionary masses in China who are striving for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The demonstrating masses expressed that the Chinese people are determined to unite with the revolutionary people of the whole world to launch a sustained and fierce attack on the imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists centered on the Soviet revisionist traitors, and the reactionaries of all countries.

Today, the entire capital is adorned with red flags, and large banners are plastered all over the streets, presenting a fiery revolutionary and combative scene. The majestic Tiananmen Square is the gathering center of all the parading and demonstrating masses. The surging crowds from all directions flowed towards Tiananmen Square. The endless demonstrators carried giant portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, held the bright red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," waved red flags, sang revolutionary songs, and shouted: "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Down with the reactionaries of all countries!" "Firmly support the just struggles of the Parisian workers and students!" "Long live the great revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune!"

The broad masses of workers in the capital, with boundless class feelings for the French working class and all oppressed peoples of the world, marched out of the workshops to hold demonstrations and parades, supporting the struggles of the progressive students and worker brothers in France. They highly praised the current just struggles of the French revolutionary people as the continuation of the revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune in the 1960s. The workers shouted during the parade: "Firmly support the struggles of the French revolutionary people!" "Firmly support the just war of the great Vietnamese people to resist America and save the nation!" "Firmly support the just struggles of the workers and students in Europe, America, and Oceania!" "Firmly support the struggles for liberation of all oppressed peoples and nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and all oppressed peoples and nations in the world!" "Workers of the world, unite!" "Marxist-Leninists of the world, unite in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism!" "Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" The revolutionary workers of Beijing said, the revolutionary principles of the Paris Commune are immortal. We, the working class, firmly believe that the revolutionary struggles of the French people will definitely move from victory to greater victories, and the revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune will definitely be carried forward.

Many revolutionary workers excitedly said, the just struggles of the French workers and students with revolutionary traditions have developed to a new stage. Revolutionary students are taking the road to unite with the workers' movement and strive for the leadership of the working class, which is a revolutionary road. This is a great encouragement to us, the working class. We firmly support their revolutionary rebellious actions! Workers in the distant suburbs held demonstrations and parades near their factories. They said, the experience of the Chinese working class and laboring people fighting under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought proves that only by carrying forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat and smashing the old world to pieces can we build a new world.

The workers pointed out: The revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries have always been mutually supportive and encouraging. Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese working class will, with the actual actions of seizing the revolution and promoting production, strive for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to support the struggles of the revolutionary people of Europe and North America.

The workers pointed out: The struggles of the Vietnamese people against America to save the nation, the struggles of the American blacks against American imperialism, and the struggles of the workers and students in Europe and North America all prove the wise judgment of our great leader Chairman Mao that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers.

The revolutionary workers of the capital who participated in the demonstration and parade angrily denounced the betrayal by the Soviet revisionist leadership and the French revisionist clique. They pointed out that the modern revisionist clique and various traitors and scabs viciously attack and sabotage the workers' and students' movements in Western Europe and North America, openly serving imperialism and the monopolistic bourgeoisie, playing a most disgraceful role. History has doomed the reactionary forces to perish and the revolutionary forces to win. The treacherous plots of modern revisionism and all traitors and scabs will never succeed. Their betrayal will only arouse new awakening among the revolutionary people of the world. The surging tide of the people's movements in Western Europe and North America will definitely roll forward with irresistible momentum.

The broad masses of Red Guards in the capital have been closely following the just struggles of the French workers and students in recent days. School radio stations have been continuously broadcasting news of the brave struggles of French students, introducing the situation of French workers supporting the just struggles of students, and exposing the traitorous faces of modern revisionists who betray the students and workers' movements. Many schools hurriedly made banners and slogans for the demonstration and parade overnight and went out to demonstrate early in the morning. They said, Chairman Mao taught us: "The thousands of words and ten thousand sentences of Marxism-Leninism, in the final analysis, amount to one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.'" The revolutionary rebellious actions of the workers and students in France and Europe and North America are excellent! It greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary people of the world and greatly dampens the spirits of the imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists centered on the Soviet revisionist traitors, and the reactionaries of all countries. We, the Red Guards of China, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, will, with the actual actions of seizing the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly support the revolutionary rebellious actions of the oppressed peoples of the world.

The Red Guard fighters in the capital enthusiastically praised the struggles of the progressive students and the working class with a glorious revolutionary tradition in France. They said: The Parisian students, with great courage, broke through the suppression and persecution of the military police, braved the attacks of poison gas and tear gas, and launched a courageous challenge to the rotten bourgeois education system and the decaying capitalist system. Currently, the powerful student movement, combined with the increasingly thriving French workers' movement, has formed an irresistible revolutionary torrent, shaking the entire France and the capitalist world. Their revolutionary actions are excellent, excellent! We firmly support them. We firmly believe that the future of France will definitely belong to the French working class and the French laboring people.

Some revolutionary teachers and students in schools, before participating in the parade, once again studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune," expressing their determination to learn from the lofty internationalist spirit of Comrade Norman Bethune, firmly support the just struggles of the French workers and students, and support the people's movements in Europe and North America. They said: The just struggles of the French workers and students are part of the world revolutionary movement, which shows that the world revolutionary situation is excellent and getting better and better. Many Red Guard fighters said: The new surge in the workers' and students' movements in Europe and North America eloquently proves the scientific judgment of the great leader Chairman Mao that "the enemy is getting rotten day by day, and we are getting better day by day." We will firmly follow Chairman Mao's teachings, carry forward the spirit of proletarian internationalism, and with hearts loyal to Chairman Mao, support the just struggles of the people of the world.

"People who have already won revolution should aid the struggles of those who are fighting for liberation, this is our internationalist duty." The Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students of primary, secondary, and tertiary schools in the capital remember Chairman Mao's teachings, parading and demonstrating in Tiananmen Square, firmly supporting the people's movements in France and Europe and North America.

    首都五十万工人、红卫兵、革命群众大示威  支持法国和欧洲、北美各国人民正义斗争
    示威群众振臂高呼：打倒美帝国主义！打倒苏修！打倒各国反动派！伟大的巴黎公社革命传统万岁！他们愤怒谴责苏修领导集团、法国修正主义集团的叛卖行径
    新华社二十一日讯　今天，首都五十多万工人、红卫兵、革命师生、革命干部，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，充满无产阶级的革命热情，举行了声势浩大的游行示威，坚决支持巴黎工人、学生和全法国革命人民的正义斗争，坚决支持欧洲、北美各国人民的正义斗争。
    游行示威的人们高度赞扬欧洲、北美进步学生运动正在同工人运动逐步汇合，显示出了巨大力量，这些地区的人民运动的兴起，震撼了以美国为首的各国垄断资产阶级的反动统治。革命群众指出，欧洲、北美人民运动的新高涨，是世界革命形势大好新的突出标志。
    资本主义世界心脏地区汹涌澎湃的人民运动，给了以美国为首的帝国主义、苏修叛徒集团和各国反动派以新的有力的打击，给了各国革命人民和正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的中国广大革命群众以巨大的鼓舞和支持。游行示威的群众表示，中国人民誓与全世界革命人民团结起来，向着以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派展开持久、猛烈的进攻。
    今天，首都全城红旗飘扬，巨幅标语贴满街头，呈现一片火热的革命战斗的景象。雄伟的天安门广场，是整个游行示威群众汇集的中心。浩浩荡荡的队伍，从四面八方涌向天安门广场。络绎不绝的示威群众，抬着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，举着红旗，唱着革命歌曲，高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒苏修！”“打倒各国反动派！”“坚决支持巴黎工人、学生的正义斗争！”“伟大的巴黎公社革命传统万岁！”
    首都广大工人群众怀着对法国工人阶级和全世界被压迫人民无限关怀的阶级感情，走出车间，举行示威游行，声援法国进步学生和工人兄弟的斗争。他们高度赞扬法国革命人民当前的正义斗争，是巴黎公社革命斗争传统在二十世纪六十年代的继续。工人们在游行时不断地高呼：“坚决支持法国革命人民的斗争！”“坚决支持伟大的越南人民抗美救国的正义战争！”“坚决支持欧洲、美洲、大洋洲的工人、学生的正义斗争！”“坚决支持亚非拉和全世界一切被压迫人民被压迫民族的解放斗争！”“全世界无产者，联合起来！”“全世界马克思列宁主义者在反帝反修的斗争中联合起来！”“战无不胜的马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”北京的革命工人说，巴黎公社的革命原则是不朽的。我们工人阶级坚决相信，法国人民的革命斗争必将从胜利走向更大的胜利，巴黎公社的革命斗争传统定将更加发扬光大。
    许多革命工人激动地说，具有革命传统的法国工人和学生的正义斗争，已经发展到了一个新的阶段，革命的学生走向同工人运动相结合的道路，争取工人阶级的领导，这是一条革命的道路。这对我们工人阶级是一个很大的鼓舞。我们坚决支持他们的革命造反行动！远郊的工人在工厂附近举行了示威游行。他们说，我们中国工人阶级和劳动人民在毛泽东思想指引下胜利进行斗争的经验证明，只有发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，把旧世界打得落花流水，才能建立一个新世界。
    工人们指出：各国人民的革命斗争从来都是互相支援、互相鼓舞的。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，中国工人阶级将以狠抓革命、猛促生产，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的实际行动，来支援欧洲、北美各国革命人民的斗争。
　  工人们指出：越南人民反美救国的斗争、美国黑人反对美帝的斗争、欧洲北美工人学生的斗争，都证明了我们的伟大领袖毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断。
    参加示威游行的首都革命工人，愤怒地谴责了苏修领导集团、法国修正主义集团的叛卖行径。他们指出，现代修正主义集团和形形色色的叛徒、工贼，恶毒地攻击和破坏西欧、北美的工人运动和学生运动，公然为帝国主义和垄断资产阶级效劳，扮演了极其可耻的角色。历史注定了反动势力必亡，革命力量必胜。现代修正主义和一切叛徒、工贼的罪恶阴谋都绝不能得逞。他们的叛卖行径，必将更加激起全世界革命人民的新觉醒。西欧、北美人民运动的洪流，一定会以不可阻挡之势，汹涌澎湃，滚滚向前。
    首都广大红卫兵连日来一直关注着法国工人、学生的正义斗争，学校广播台不断广播法国学生英勇斗争的消息，介绍法国工人支持学生正义斗争的情况，揭露现代修正主义者出卖学生和工人运动的叛徒嘴脸。许多学校连夜赶制游行示威的旗子、标语，一早就上街游行示威。他们说，毛主席教导我们：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”法国以及欧洲、北美工人、学生的革命造反行动好得很！它大长了全世界革命人民的志气，大灭了以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派的威风。我们中国红卫兵遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，要以夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的实际行动，来坚决支持世界被压迫人民的革命造反行动。
    首都红卫兵战士热烈赞扬法国的进步学生和具有光荣革命传统的法国工人阶级的斗争。他们说：巴黎学生以大无畏的精神，冲破军警的镇压和迫害，冒着毒气和催泪弹的袭击，向腐朽的资产阶级教育制度，向腐朽没落的资本主义制度，进行了英勇的挑战。目前，声势浩大的学生运动，与日益蓬勃发展的法国工人运动相结合，汇成了一股不可抗拒的革命洪流，冲击了整个法国，震撼了资本主义世界，他们的革命行动好得很，好极了！我们坚决支持他们。我们坚信，法国的未来必定属于法国的工人阶级和法国劳动人民。
    有的学校的革命师生在参加游行之前，再一次学习了毛主席的光辉著作《纪念白求恩》，表示要学习白求恩同志崇高的国际主义精神，坚决支持法国工人、学生的正义斗争，支持欧洲、北美的人民运动。他们说：法国工人、学生的正义斗争是世界革命运动的组成部分，它表明了世界革命形势大好，越来越好。许多红卫兵战士说：欧洲、北美工人运动和学生运动的新高涨，雄辩地证明了伟大领袖毛主席指出的“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”的科学论断。我们要坚决遵照毛主席的教导，发扬无产阶级国际主义精神，以无限忠于毛主席的红心，支持世界人民的正义斗争。
