The sun rises in the east, its rays shining far and wide. On the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th Directive," we, the representatives of the Shanghai Maritime Bureau attending the National Railway and Transportation Conference, were received by our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, and other central leaders on the evening of the eighth. This is the greatest care, greatest encouragement, and greatest inspiration for the broad revolutionary workers on the national railway and transportation front. We are extremely moved, our hearts surging with emotion, tears of joy streaming down our faces, and we raise our arms a thousand times, a million times, shouting: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

Father and mother are dear, but not as dear as Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We, the revolutionary sailors of Shanghai, pledge to you: We will forever read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your directives. We will forever be your good soldiers, following you in revolution for life. We will forever sail along the revolutionary course you have charted, breaking waves and advancing to victory!

On the evening of the eighth, we returned to our lodging with hearts full of joy and immediately reported this heartening news to Shanghai. At ten o'clock in the evening, our Shanghai Maritime Bureau sent a joyous telegram to all our ships at sea, letting the revolutionary sailors fighting on the sea share the greatest happiness of being received by the great leader Chairman Mao.

The revolutionary sailors of our bureau, in order to welcome the convening of the National Railway and Transportation Conference with practical actions, have carried out revolutionary and production work vigorously, achieving many advanced deeds. From January to April this year, we have fully and over-fulfilled the transportation production tasks. The "Daqing 17" ship successfully experimented with a new method of using the ship's oil pump to directly unload oil from oil trucks to oil ships, reducing the unloading process and greatly improving unloading efficiency. The crew of the "Battle 39" ship, following your great teaching of "frugality is revolutionary," solved the problem of the coal-fired cabin, enabling each voyage to carry more than a hundred tons of additional coal. The "Battle 8" ship successfully tested the transportation of fish fry for the first time, with a survival rate of over 99%, effectively supporting agriculture.

We are determined to seriously study and fully implement your latest directives, closely follow your great strategic deployment, uphold and carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, forever maintain revolutionary vigor and a strong fighting will, promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, and make our bureau's revolutionary committee grow stronger and stronger in leading the broad revolutionary masses to actively attack the class enemy, forever becoming a revolutionary fighting command center!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We will definitely resolutely implement your brilliant "May 7th Directive," turning every ship in our maritime bureau into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, where work is the main focus, and military, political, and cultural studies are combined, and where criticism of the bourgeoisie is carried out. We will definitely hold power well, use power well, and carry out a sustained revolutionary criticism, launching a new high tide of seizing revolution and promoting production, continuously innovating technology, fully and over-fulfilling production and transportation tasks, and making new contributions to the socialist construction of our motherland and supporting the world revolution. Let the invincible red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high over the vast seas of our motherland!

    我局广大革命海员，为了以实际行动迎接全国铁路、交通会议的召开，革命和生产搞得轰轰烈烈，出现了许多先进事迹。今年一月至四月，全面超额完成了运输生产任务。“大庆十七号”轮，试验成功了用船上的油泵直接从油车卸油到油船的新方法，减少了卸油环节，大大提高了卸油效率。“战斗三十九号”轮的船员，遵照您提出的“要节约闹革命”的伟大教导，解决了烧煤舱的问题，使每航次多运煤炭一百多吨。“战斗八号”轮首次试运鱼苗成功，成活率达到百分之九十九以上，有力地支援了农业。

    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们一定要坚决贯彻执行您光辉的“五·七”指示，把我们海运局的每一条船，都办成以工为主，兼学军事、政治、文化，又批判资产阶级的红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。我们一定要掌好权，用好权，持久地开展革命的大批判，掀起抓革命、促生产的新高潮，不断革新技术，全面超额完成生产运输任务，为祖国社会主义建设和支援世界革命作出新的贡献，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在祖国辽阔的海洋上永远飘扬！
