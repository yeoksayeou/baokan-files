The recent local "elections" in Britain were boycotted by the broad masses of workers, and the Labour Party government was defeated in this "election." This fact reflects the increasingly severe political crisis of British imperialism and the growing instability of the reactionary rule of the British monopolistic bourgeoisie.

The British Labour Party is a tool of the British monopolistic bourgeoisie. The great revolutionary leader Lenin once pointed out: "The Labour Party is completely a bourgeois party. Although it is composed of workers, it is led by counter-revolutionaries, the worst counter-revolutionaries who act entirely according to the intentions of the bourgeoisie." Every Labour Party government has faithfully followed the dictates of the British monopolistic bourgeoisie, executing reactionary domestic and foreign policies. This Labour Party government, facing the most serious political and economic crises of British imperialism since the war, has done all sorts of evil things to save British imperialism from decline. It has intensified its pursuit of American imperialism's policy of aggression and war, ruthlessly exploiting and oppressing the colonial peoples, and deliberately making an enemy of the Chinese people. Domestically, it has step by step strengthened its attacks on the British working people. Since this year, the Labour Party government has even more viciously shifted the economic difficulties onto the broad masses of British working people, freezing wages, increasing taxes, and forcing them to tighten their belts further; at the same time, it passed a reactionary law restricting the entry of colored immigrants from the Commonwealth, further promoting imperialist racial discrimination policies. However, the desperate struggles of the Labour Party government have not alleviated the plight of the British ruling class but have only exposed their counter-revolutionary face more thoroughly, thereby provoking strong resistance from the British people. The recent strike by three million mechanical workers is a powerful action by the British working class against the monopolistic bourgeoisie and its agent, the Labour Party government.

The Labour Party tool is no longer effective. The British monopolistic bourgeoisie is at a loss, plunged into a state of panic. Their representatives are now coming out, some criticizing the Labour Party, calling for the Labour Party to step down; some attacking Wilson, demanding his immediate resignation; some advocating for the Conservative Party to take over; some advocating for the formation of a "united government," with the representatives of the monopolistic bourgeoisie taking personal charge. All this exposes the further collapse of the parliamentary system of British imperialism. The British ruling class is trying to use the tactic of "changing horses" to ease the discontent of the British people towards the reactionary ruling class, while creating public opinion for another of their tools to take over.

The so-called "two-party system" of the Labour Party and the Conservative Party taking turns in power is a means for the British monopolistic bourgeoisie to maintain its reactionary rule. Whether replacing the Conservative Party with the Labour Party or replacing the Labour Party with the Conservative Party, or forming a "united government," the goal is the same: to deceive and lull the British working class and laboring people, to preserve the reactionary rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie.

The era we are in is one where imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse. British imperialism is already on the decline, gasping for breath. Whether it is the Labour Party or the Conservative Party, or the representatives of the monopolistic bourgeoisie taking personal charge, none can save British imperialism from the serious political and economic crises it faces, nor can they alleviate the increasingly acute class contradictions within Britain. As British imperialism declines, the British people are becoming more and more awakened. Now, the British working class is taking action, the colored residents of Britain are taking action, and the progressive young students of Britain are also taking action. No matter what means the British monopolistic bourgeoisie continues to use to struggle, it is in vain; their days of doom will not be far off.

    日暮途穷
    英国最近举行的地方“选举”，遭到广大工人群众的抵制，工党政府在这次“选举”中一败涂地。这个事实，反映了英帝国主义的政治危机日益严重，英国垄断资产阶级的反动统治越来越不稳。
    英国的工党是英国垄断资产阶级手中的一个工具。伟大的革命导师列宁曾经指出：“工党完全是资产阶级的政党。虽然它是由工人组成的，但是领导它的是反革命分子，是完全按照资产阶级的意图行动的最坏的反革命分子。”历届工党政府，无不忠实地按照英国垄断资产阶级的意旨，执行反动的内外政策。这一届工党政府，面临着战后英帝国主义最严重的政治危机和经济危机，为了挽救英帝国主义的没落，更是干尽了坏事。它对外加紧追随美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，残酷地剥削和压迫殖民地人民，蓄意同中国人民为敌；对内步步加强对英国劳动人民的进攻。今年以来，工党政府更加穷凶极恶地向英国广大劳动人民转嫁经济困难，冻结工资，增加税收，强迫他们进一步勒紧裤带；同时，通过了限制英联邦有色人种移民入境的反动法案，进一步推行帝国主义的种族歧视政策。但是，工党政府的这种绝望的挣扎，丝毫解脱不了英国统治集团所处的困境，反而使自己的反革命面目暴露得更加彻底，因而激起了英国人民的强烈反抗。三百万机械工人最近举行大罢工，就是英国工人阶级反对垄断资产阶级及其代理人工党政府的一次有力行动。
    工党这个工具不灵了。英国垄断资产阶级手足无措，陷于一片惊惶之中。他们的代表人物现在纷纷出来，有的指责工党，叫嚷要工党下台；有的抨击威尔逊，要他立即辞职；有的主张保守党上台；有的鼓吹成立“联合政府”，由垄断资产阶级代表亲自出马。这一切暴露了英帝国主义议会制度的进一步破产。英国统治集团企图用“换马”的手法来缓和英国人民对反动统治集团的不满，同时为他们的另一个工具上台制造舆论。
    工党和保守党轮流坐庄的所谓“两党制”，是英国垄断资产阶级维护它的反动统治的一种手段。用工党替换保守党也好，用保守党替换工党也好，搞什么“联合政府”也好，目的都是一个，就是欺骗和麻痹英国的工人阶级和劳动人民，保住垄断资产阶级的反动统治。
    我们现在所处的时代是帝国主义走向全面崩溃的时代。英帝国主义已是日薄西山，奄奄一息。不论是工党还是保守党，或是垄断资产阶级代表亲自出马，都解救不了英帝国主义所面临的严重政治危机和经济危机，缓和不了英国国内日益激化的阶级矛盾。随着英帝国主义的没落，英国人民正在日益觉醒。现在，英国工人阶级行动起来了，英国的有色人种居民行动起来了，英国的进步青年学生也行动起来了。不管英国垄断资产阶级继续采取什么样的手段进行挣扎，都是徒劳的，他们灭亡的日子不会太远了。
