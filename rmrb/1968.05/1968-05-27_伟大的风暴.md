The great storm of revolutionary mass movements that has risen in France and Europe, and North America, continues to develop with overwhelming force. Ten million French workers have joined the strike struggle, occupying half of the country's factories and mines. In Paris, students, with the support of workers, are bravely fighting against the reactionary military police, igniting a new wave of struggle. The peasant movement is rapidly developing as the workers' struggle deepens. The tide of the people's struggle is spreading to more and more capitalist countries. This is an unprecedented large-scale mass struggle in the heart of the capitalist world in decades, and it has dealt a massive blow to the decaying capitalist system.

The great power of the masses is vividly demonstrated in this storm. We have once again seen the correctness of Chairman Mao's statement that "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers" in the overwhelming revolutionary actions of the French workers, students, and the broad masses of the people.

The just struggles of the peoples of France and Europe, and North America, have resonated deeply worldwide, gaining widespread sympathy and support from the revolutionary peoples of all countries. In recent days, two hundred million military personnel and civilians across China have held massive demonstrations, expressing the resolute support of the 700 million Chinese people for the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Europe and North America.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The proletariat and laboring masses of Europe, North America, and Oceania are in a new state of awakening." The current vigorous development of the revolutionary mass movements in Europe and North America is a sign of the new awakening of the proletariat and the broad masses of these countries.

Just like all old traitors and opportunists, the Soviet revisionist clique and the French revisionist clique have played the most despicable roles in this great storm. When the mass movements first emerged, they viciously slandered all revolutionary actions that broke through their revisionist frameworks as "adventurism," and so on. When the revolutionary mass movements quickly became a raging fire, disregarding their slanders, they eagerly colluded with the monopolistic bourgeoisie, trying to quickly sell out the revolution, extinguish the revolution, and grab a bit of oil for themselves. We will wait and see what other despicable clownish performances they will put on in the historical arena.

In this storm, the revolutionary masses of Europe and North America dare to defy the laws and bayonets of the reactionary ruling cliques, fear no suppression, and persist in brave struggles, showing a vibrant revolutionary spirit.

In this storm, the various strata of people in Europe and North America have put forward various specific demands and battle slogans. Their struggle is clearly aimed at the evil rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie and the entire capitalist system. This shows that the level of the mass struggles in Europe and North America has reached a new height.

In this storm, young students have played a vanguard role and are increasingly combining with the workers' movement. The student movement and the workers' movement support and inspire each other, powerfully promoting the further rise of the entire people's movement.

In this storm, the broad masses of students and workers in Europe and North America have broken through the usual forms of mass struggles, beginning to adopt a series of violent and combative actions, creating new experiences for the revolutionary mass movements in capitalist countries.

Chairman Mao has taught us: "Imperialism has prepared the conditions for its own doom. The awakening of the masses of the people in the colonies, semi-colonies, and imperialist countries themselves is such a condition."

Today, we are in a new great era of world revolution. The national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have heavily struck the imperialism led by the United States, promoting the development of political and economic crises in imperialist countries and intensifying class contradictions within these countries. The broad working class and oppressed peoples have shown increasingly strong dissatisfaction and resistance to the reactionary rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie and the existing social system. The new surge of revolutionary mass movements in Europe and North America is a prominent manifestation of the increasingly profound and intense conflicts within the capitalist world.

The widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought has promoted the deep development of contemporary world revolution. The great victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has inspired the revolutionary will of the peoples of various countries to dare to struggle and dare to win. From the thriving revolutionary mass movements in Europe and North America, one can see the growing influence of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution on the broad masses of people in this region.

Eleven years ago, Chairman Mao argued when discussing the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind: "The population of the imperialist camp is only about 400 million, and they are divided within. There will be an 'earthquake' there."

Europe and North America are the old nests of imperialism. Imperialism led by the United States has always regarded this region as their reliable rear base, with the strictest control; modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Union, including various traitors, scabs, and counter-revolutionary lackeys, has also strenuously helped them stabilize the reactionary rule in this region. Today, the rapid development of the mass movements of the peoples of Europe and North America, like a fierce earthquake, has shattered the sweet dreams of the international monopolistic bourgeoisie. Imperialism no longer has a paradise.

Wherever there is the dark rule of imperialism and reactionaries, the people, who make up more than 90% of the population, will inevitably rise up in revolution. The development of the revolutionary struggles of the working class and the broad masses of people in Europe and North America is inevitable. The monopolistic bourgeoisie cannot stop it, the Social Democratic Party cannot stop it, and modern revisionism cannot stop it. In Europe and North America, the truly powerful force is the broad masses of people in that region, not the monopolistic bourgeoisie. The revolutions in these countries are full of hope.

People around the world are thrilled and inspired by the great storm of mass movements in Europe and North America. The 700 million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, stand firmly on the side of the revolutionary peoples of Europe and North America. We believe that the working class, peasants, progressive youth, and all revolutionary masses in Europe and North America will be tempered, raise their consciousness, strengthen their unity, and grow their strength in the fiery struggle. We believe that the working class and the broad masses of people in Europe and North America, united with the revolutionary peoples of the world, will persist in brave and sustained struggles. Capitalism and imperialism will surely be buried!

    伟大的风暴
    在法国和欧洲、北美兴起的革命群众运动的大风暴，这几天来正以排山倒海之势，继续迅猛发展。一千万法国工人投入了罢工斗争，工人占领了全国一半的工矿企业；巴黎学生在工人支援下，同反动军警进行英勇搏斗，掀起了新的斗争怒涛。农民运动正随着工人斗争的深入而迅速发展起来。人民群众的斗争浪潮，向越来越多的资本主义国家扩展。这是几十年来从未有过的在资本主义世界心脏地区爆发的巨大规模的群众斗争，它给予腐朽没落的资本主义制度以巨大的冲击。
    人民群众的伟大力量，在这个风暴中表现得极其鲜明。我们在法国工人、学生和广大人民群众的排山倒海的革命行动中，再一次看到了毛主席指出的“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”这个真理是多么正确。
    法国和欧洲、北美各国人民的正义斗争，在全世界引起了巨大的反响，获得了全世界各国革命人民的广泛同情和支持。最近几天，我国全国各地两千万军民连续举行声势浩大的示威，表示了七亿中国人民对欧洲、北美人民革命斗争的坚决支持。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席指出：“欧洲、北美和大洋洲的无产阶级和劳动人民，正处在新的觉醒之中。”当前欧洲、北美革命群众运动的蓬勃发展，就是这些国家无产阶级和广大人民新的觉醒的标志。
    正同一切老叛徒、老机会主义者一模一样，苏修叛徒集团、法修叛徒集团在这个伟大的风暴中，扮演了最无耻的角色。当群众运动刚刚出现时，他们卑鄙地诬蔑一切冲破他们修正主义框框的革命行动为什么“冒险主义”等等。当革命群众运动象抛垃圾一样抛开他们的诬蔑而迅速成为熊熊烈火时，他们又迫不及待地勾结垄断资产阶级，想尽快地出卖革命，扑灭革命，自己捞到一点油水。他们在历史舞台上还要作些什么卑鄙的小丑式的表演，我们且拭目以待。
    在这一场风暴中，欧洲、北美的革命群众敢于藐视反动统治集团的法律和刺刀，不怕镇压，坚持英勇的斗争，表现出了生气勃勃的革命气概。
    在这一场风暴中，欧洲、北美的各阶层人民提出了各种不同的具体要求和战斗口号。他们斗争的总矛头明确地指向垄断资产阶级的罪恶统治，指向整个资本主义制度。这表明了欧洲、北美群众斗争的水平发展到了一个新的高度。
    在这一场风暴中，青年学生起着先锋的作用，并且日益同工人运动结合起来。学生运动和工人运动相互支持，相互鼓舞，有力地推动了整个人民运动的进一步高涨。
    在这一场风暴中，欧洲、北美的广大学生和工人群众突破了往常群众运动中的一般的斗争形式，开始采取了一系列富有战斗性的暴烈的行动，为资本主义国家的革命群众运动创造了崭新的斗争经验。
    毛主席曾经教导我们：“帝国主义给自己准备了灭亡的条件。殖民地半殖民地的人民大众和帝国主义自己国家内的人民大众的觉悟，就是这样的条件。”
    今天，我们正处在一个世界革命的新的伟大时代。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放运动，沉重地打击了以美国为首的帝国主义，促进了帝国主义国家的政治经济危机的发展，加剧了这些国家国内的阶级矛盾。广大工人阶级和被压迫人民，对于垄断资产阶级的反动统治和现存的社会制度，表现出越来越强烈的不满和反抗。欧洲、北美革命群众运动的新高涨，正是资本主义世界内部冲突日益深刻、剧烈的一个突出表现。
    毛泽东思想在全世界的广泛传播，推动了当代世界革命的深入发展。中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，激发了各国人民敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命意志。从欧洲、北美蓬勃发展的革命群众运动中，人们可以看到中国无产阶级文化大革命对这个地区广大人民群众所产生的日益增长的影响。
    毛主席在十一年前论证东风压倒西风的时候曾经说过：“帝国主义阵营的人口不过四亿左右，而且他们的内部是分裂的。那里会发生‘地震’。”
    欧洲、北美是帝国主义的老巢。以美国为首的帝国主义过去一直把这个地区看作它们牢靠的后方，控制最为严密；以苏修为中心的现代修正主义，包括形形色色的叛徒、工贼、反革命走卒，也竭力帮助它们稳定在这个地区的反动统治。今天，欧洲、北美人民群众运动的迅猛发展，如同猛烈的地震，粉碎了国际垄断资产阶级的酣梦。帝国主义已经再没有安乐土了。
    哪里有帝国主义和反动派的黑暗统治，哪里占人口百分之九十以上的人民总是要起来革命的，欧洲、北美工人阶级和广大人民的革命斗争的发展，是不可避免的。垄断资产阶级阻挡不了，社会民主党阻挡不了，现代修正主义也阻挡不了。在欧洲、北美，真正有力量的是那个地区的广大人民，而决不是垄断资产阶级。这些国家的革命是大有希望的。
    全世界人民，都在为欧洲、北美群众运动的大风暴而欢欣鼓舞。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，坚决站在欧洲、北美革命人民一边。我们相信，欧洲、北美的工人阶级、农民、进步青年和一切革命群众，将在火热的斗争中不断受到锻炼，提高觉悟，加强团结，壮大自己的力量。我们相信，欧洲、北美的工人阶级和广大人民群众同全世界广大革命人民联合起来，坚持英勇的、持久的战斗，资本主义和帝国主义制度就一定会被埋葬！
