	U.S. Aggressors Out of South Vietnam Immediately!
	Sudan Afro-Asian Solidarity Organization Denounces Johnson's "Peace" Deception
	New Zealand People Protest Against U.S. Imperialist Aggression in Vietnam

	New China News Agency, Khartoum. The Sudan Afro-Asian Solidarity Organization recently held a rally to support the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The rally participants waved the flags of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and chanted slogans such as "Long live the armed struggle of the Vietnamese people!" "Long live the people's war!" "Down with Johnson!" "Without guns, there is no freedom!"

	The rally participants read a telegram to Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam led by Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho in front of the Sudanese government office.

	In the telegram to Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the Sudan Afro-Asian Solidarity Organization condemned the barbaric crimes committed by U.S. imperialism in Vietnam and expressed full support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

	The telegram said: "We believe that the Vietnamese people, who once defeated the French imperialist army at Dien Bien Phu, will definitely defeat the U.S. aggressor troops and reunify the country." The telegram said:

	"Your brave people have inspired the people of the world and shown the people of the world that in the face of the nuclear threat from imperialism and its lackeys, one must dare to fight and not retreat."

	The telegram exposed that Johnson's "peace" deception is a ploy by imperialism to deceive world public opinion and to gain time and breathing space. The telegram pointed out that the nature of imperialism will not change. The telegram also said: "Due to the increasing number of people around the world who oppose U.S. imperialist policies, U.S. imperialism is now completely isolated. The continuous struggle of the Vietnamese people and the revolutionary people of the world will definitely drive out the aggressors."

	In the telegram to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, the Sudan Afro-Asian Solidarity Organization said that the brave liberation struggle of the South Vietnamese people "has inspired all revolutionary people and taught the oppressed people to continue the struggle, overcome difficulties, and wage a people's war to defeat the aggressors." The telegram pointed out that the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation has also taught people that no matter how small their country is, they can definitely defeat the seemingly powerful aggressors.

	The telegram said that in the past seven years, the South Vietnamese people have annihilated more than a million U.S. puppet troops, liberated four-fifths of the land, and have two-thirds of the people living in the liberated areas, which proves the power of the people's war. The telegram said: "You have taken up arms to fight the aggressors, and you are advancing on the road to freedom. This is the true path that will lead you to final victory."

	New China News Agency, Auckland. About 200 New Zealand protesters demonstrated on May 19th in front of the U.S. warship "Okanogan" docked at the Auckland wharf, protesting against U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam.

	The protesters held up signs opposing U.S. aggression in Vietnam and shouted slogans at the U.S. warship, such as "Vietnam will win!" "We will defeat the United States!" and so on.

	The signs they held read: "Yankees, get out of Vietnam immediately!" "U.S. out of South Vietnam now, no more deceitful peace talks!" "Only when the U.S. withdraws, will Vietnam achieve peace!" "We support the National Liberation Front's struggle for freedom!" and so on.

	About 20 young people, despite police interference, bravely boarded the U.S. warship and unfurled a large banner at the bow, which read: "The National Liberation Front will win!" They also held up other banners that read: "U.S. sailors, rebellion is justified, get off the ship now!" "U.S. sailors, don't die for the fascists!" They continued to shout slogans on the warship.

	The protesters posted hundreds of signs around the warship, demanding that the U.S. get out of South Vietnam immediately.

    美国侵略者立即滚出南越！
    苏丹亚非团结组织谴责约翰逊玩弄“和平”骗局
    新西兰人民群众示威反对美帝国主义侵略越南
    新华社喀土穆电　苏丹亚非团结组织最近举行游行，支持越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争。游行者高举越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜，高呼：“越南人民的武装斗争万岁！”“人民战争万岁！”“打倒约翰逊！”“没有枪杆子就没有自由！”等口号。
    游行者在苏丹政府办公处门前宣读了给胡志明主席和越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团阮友寿主席的电报。
    在给胡志明主席的电报中，苏丹亚非团结组织谴责美帝国主义在越南所犯下的野蛮罪行，并且表示完全支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争。
    电报说：“我们相信，曾经在奠边府击败过法帝国主义军队的越南人民，定能战胜美国侵略军，统一祖国。”电报说：
  “你们的英勇的人民鼓舞了全世界人民，并向全世界人民指出，在帝国主义及其走狗的核武器威胁面前要敢于斗争，不要后退。”
    电报揭露说，约翰逊施展的“和平”骗局是帝国主义为了欺骗世界公众舆论，为了争取时间，获得喘息机会。电报指出，帝国主义者的本性是不会改变的。电报还说：“由于全世界反对美帝国主义的政策的人数日益增加，美帝国主义现在完全孤立了。越南人民和世界革命人民不断进行的斗争肯定将赶走侵略者。”
    苏丹亚非团结组织在给阮友寿主席的电报中说，越南南方人民进行的英勇的解放斗争“鼓舞了所有的革命人民，并且教育了被压迫人民要继续斗争和克服困难，并且进行人民战争，战胜侵略者。”电报指出，越南人民抗美救国的斗争还教育了人们，不管他们的国家多小，他们定能击败貌似强大的侵略者。
    电报说，七年来，越南南方人民歼灭了一百多万美伪军，解放了五分之四的土地，有三分之二的人民生活在解放区，这证明了人民战争的威力。电报说：“你们拿起枪杆子，同侵略者斗争，你们在自由的大道上前进。这是一条真正的道路，它将引导你们取得最后的胜利。”
    新华社奥克兰十九日电　两百名新西兰示威者，十九日向停泊在奥克兰码头的美国军舰“奥卡诺甘号”示威，抗议美帝国主义侵略越南。
    示威者举着反对美国侵略越南的标语牌，冲着美国军舰高呼：“越南必胜！”“我们将打败美国！”等口号。
    他们举的标语牌上写着：“美国佬，立即滚出越南！”
  “美国立即（从南越）撤走，不要骗人的和谈！”“只有美国撤走，越南才能实现和平！”“我们支持（越南南方）民族解放阵线争取自由的斗争！”等等。
    大约二十名青年不顾警察的阻拦，勇敢地登上这艘美军军舰，并在舰首展开了一面大旗，上面写着：“民族解放阵线必胜！”他们还举起了另外一些旗帜，上面写着：“美国水兵们，造反有理，立即离开军舰吧！”“美国水兵们，不要替法西斯卖命！”他们在军舰上还不断高呼口号。
    示威者在军舰的周围张贴了数以百计的标语，要求美国立即从南越滚出去。
