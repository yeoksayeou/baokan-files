Paris workers, students, and teachers held a massive demonstration in the French capital on the 13th, protesting the government's bloody suppression of the student movement and the rotten educational system. On the same day, demonstrations involving tens of thousands of people erupted in more than ten major French cities. The united struggle of French workers and students shook the entire country and dealt a powerful blow to the French ruling class.

Over a thousand French workers, outraged by the fascist violence of the police, went on a nationwide 24-hour general strike on the 13th, leaving their factories, mines, and workplaces. The strike disrupted water, electricity, and gas supplies, halted air and land transportation, closed many factories and schools, and left banks and offices unmanned, bringing many French cities to a standstill.

On the 13th, 800,000 workers, students, and teachers in Paris held the largest demonstration since World War II. At 3:30 PM, the procession started from the Place de la République on the right bank of the Seine. When the vanguard had already marched ten miles away, the square was still teeming with people. The demonstrators waved many red flags, sang the "Internationale," and chanted slogans protesting police brutality and "De Gaulle is a murderer." Workers and students stood shoulder to shoulder, jointly holding a ten-meter-long banner that read: "Students, teachers, and workers unite!" The crowd surged through the center of Paris like a tide, demonstrating in front of the Paris police headquarters and the highest court, crossing the Seine, and finally ending their march in the university district.

Students distributed leaflets along the way and used loudspeakers to expose the French government's continuous dispatch of large police forces to brutally suppress students over the past ten days. They angrily condemned the authorities for using poison gas and military tear gas against unarmed students. Many students had their brains and internal organs severely damaged by the gas, and some had lost their sight. They demanded the immediate resignation of Interior Minister Fouchet and Paris Police Chief Grimaud. Paris residents widely supported the demonstration, with many spontaneously joining the march.

The demonstration terrified the French authorities. The government deployed 20,000 to 30,000 fully armed police to monitor the marching crowds and protect the presidential palace, the Élysée Palace, and the residences of the prime minister and ministers.

On the 13th, the wave of student and worker struggles swept through France's major cities. Marseille saw 70,000 demonstrators, Toulouse and Bordeaux each had 30,000 marchers, Nice had 20,000, Nantes and Angers each had 15,000.

Under the pressure of the mass struggle, Prime Minister Pompidou, after consulting with President De Gaulle, had to withdraw police from the University of Paris in the morning, release a batch of students, and have the Court of Appeal announce the "temporary release" of four university students who had been unjustly sentenced.

After the police withdrew, students, teachers, and workers occupied the University of Paris. They hoisted bright red flags on the rooftops of the school buildings. After the march ended, they held heated all-night discussions in various classrooms on issues such as reforming the French educational system, the workers' and students' movements, and the international student movement. They stated that their struggle was far from over and that French universities could not continue in their current state.

    法一千万工人总罢工支持学生斗争
    巴黎八十万群众大示威震动全法国
    据新华社十四日讯　巴黎消息：法国工人阶级十三日举行全国总罢工，声援巴黎学生反对法国政府血腥镇压学生运动、反对腐朽的教育制度的正义斗争。巴黎工人、学生、教师八十万人十三日在法国首都举行声势空前浩大的示威游行，抗议政府的暴行。同一天，法国十多个大城市爆发了几万人的示威。法国工人和学生的联合斗争震动了整个法国，给法国统治集团以有力的打击。
    对警察的法西斯暴行无比愤慨的一千多万法国工人，十三日离开了他们的工厂、矿山和工作场所，举行了二十四小时的全国总罢工。总罢工使得水、电、煤气的供应中断，空中和陆上的交通停滞，许多工厂和学校关门，银行和机关无人办公，使法国许多城市几乎陷于瘫痪。
    十三日，巴黎工人和学生、教师八十万人，在巴黎举行了法国第二次世界大战以来规模最大的一次群众示威游行。下午三时半，示威队伍从塞纳河右岸的共和国广场出发。当先头的队伍已经走出十里以外时，共和国广场里仍是人山人海。示威者高举着许多红旗，高唱着《国际歌》，高呼抗议警察暴行和“戴高乐是杀人凶手”等口号。工人和学生肩并肩地共同高举着一条十米长的巨型横幅标语，上面写着：“学生、教师和工人团结起来！”群众的巨流象潮水一般涌过巴黎市中心区，在巴黎警察总部和最高法院前示威，并越过塞纳河，最后在大学区结束他们的游行。
    学生们沿途散发传单，并通过扩音器揭露法国政府十天以来连续派遣大批警察残暴镇压学生的罪行。他们愤怒地谴责法国当局使用毒气和军用催泪弹来对付手无寸铁的学生。不少学生的脑子和内脏已受到毒气的严重伤害，有些学生至今双目失明。他们要求法国内政部长伏歇和巴黎警察头子格里穆立即下台。巴黎市民普遍支持这次示威，沿途有许多人自动参加示威的行列。
    群众的示威使法国当局吓破了胆。法国政府出动两三万全副武装的警察监视游行的队伍，保护总统府爱丽舍宫和总理、部长的住宅。
    十三日，法国学生和工人斗争的浪潮席卷了法国主要的城市。马赛有七万群众示威，图卢兹和波尔多各有三万人游行，尼斯有两万人，南特和芒城各有一万五千人。
    在群众斗争的强大压力下，法国总理蓬皮杜同法国总统戴高乐商讨对策以后，十三日晨不得不把警察撤出了巴黎大学，释放了一批学生，并且让上诉法院宣布“暂时释放”已被无理判刑的四名大学生。
    在警察撤走后，学生、教师和工人占领了巴黎大学。他们在学校建筑物的屋顶上升起了鲜艳的红旗。他们在游行结束后，在各个教室里就法国教育制度的改革、工人和学生运动、国际学生运动等问题，展开了通宵的热烈的讨论。他们表示，他们的斗争远未结束，法国的大学绝不能继续维持现状。（附图片）
