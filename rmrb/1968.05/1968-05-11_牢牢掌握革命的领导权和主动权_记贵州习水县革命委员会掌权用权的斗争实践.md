The newly established revolutionary committee, how to firmly grasp the leadership and initiative of the revolution in their hands? The experience of the Xiushui County Revolutionary Committee in Guizhou Province is: in all work, it is necessary to insist on using Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle; never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, and actively lead the broad revolutionary masses to continuously attack the class enemies; closely connect with the masses, deeply understand the trends and demands of the masses, and continuously absorb the vigorous revolutionary spirit from the revolutionary mass movement.

Only with Mao Zedong Thought can there be leadership

The comrades of the Xiushui County Revolutionary Committee believe: the most important task of the revolutionary committee is revolution; revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. They say: the red political power is not red on a sign, but red in using Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, red in the five big characters "Loyal to Chairman Mao."

Among countless tasks, grasp the fundamentals. Even if the sky falls, remain unshakable. As soon as the Xiushui County Revolutionary Committee was established, it grasped the fundamental task of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought from the countless and complex tasks. It armed the revolutionary leading cadres at all levels and the 330,000 people of the county with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, making the county revolutionary committee truly grasp the leadership and initiative of the revolution. In addition to establishing an unshakable system of studying Chairman Mao's works, they treated holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes as a top political task. The chairman of the county revolutionary committee personally led the holding of the first Mao Zedong Thought study class in the county, and the committee members went to various systems and districts under the county to organize study classes. Soon, various types of study classes spread throughout the county's towns and villages, totaling 5,700, with 75% of the county's total population participating. Through holding large-scale study classes, Mao Zedong Thought was widely promoted, and the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao was universally established. Under the influence of the example set by the committee members leading the struggle against selfishness and revisionism, and the establishment of public spirit, the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of the entire county seriously implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. All 12 districts and 85 communes in the county established revolutionary committees, achieving a complete red victory. 94.6% of the cadres above the commune level were liberated and actively took on the dual responsibilities of revolution and production. Revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination became increasingly consolidated. The leading role of the county revolutionary committee among the masses was increasingly brought into play, and work became increasingly proactive.

To lead the people of the entire county to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Xiushui County Revolutionary Committee made the extensive dissemination and implementation of Chairman Mao's every new instruction the central task of the current center. They deeply felt from their personal struggle practice that only by doing so could they follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasp the leadership and initiative of the revolution; otherwise, they would be passive in everything, unable to lead the people of the entire county to advance victoriously. On the day Chairman Mao issued the basic experience of the revolutionary committee, the comrades of the county revolutionary committee listened to the broadcast late at night, immediately recorded it, and printed it overnight for distribution. They also quickly made a resolution, requiring revolutionary committees at all levels to immediately launch a high tide of propaganda, study, and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instruction, making it known to every household. The county revolutionary committee also, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, began to reduce overlapping institutions and change the phenomenon of too many people in administrative offices.

The comrades of the revolutionary committee also believed that propagating Mao Zedong Thought and implementing Chairman Mao's instructions required fully relying on the active elements among the masses. Therefore, through holding large-scale study classes throughout the county, they trained and cultivated tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought propagandists and study guides among poor and lower-middle peasants, militiamen, and grassroots revolutionary cadres, ensuring that every production team had cadres responsible for propaganda and leading study. Now, studying Chairman Mao's works has become the first need in the lives of the revolutionary masses throughout the county. A 60-year-old poor peasant, Wang Erma, not only insists on studying every day but also compiled her experiences before and after liberation into a performance song to educate the younger generation. She sings: "Youths, remember, without Chairman Mao, there would be no liberation; happiness is all thanks to the Communist Party, forever loyal to Chairman Mao."

The revolutionary committee grasped the fundamental principle of using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, thus firmly grasping the leadership and initiative of the revolution. Before April this year, the county revolutionary committee had only eight members, five of whom were half-time. With few people and many tasks, and lacking experience, they still completed all tasks excellently. They deeply felt: acting according to Mao Zedong Thought makes everything proactive; without Mao Zedong Thought, nothing can be accomplished.

Only by firmly grasping class struggle can leadership be consolidated

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its leadership and the broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The comrades of the Xiushui County Revolutionary Committee, reviewing the experience of leading the broad revolutionary masses to actively and continuously wage class struggle since seizing power, deeply understood the profound significance of Chairman Mao's latest instruction.

In the early days of the establishment of the revolutionary committee, some comrades developed a peaceful and complacent mindset, thinking that after the capitalist roaders were overthrown, they could "let the horses graze freely and put away the weapons." As soon as the responsible comrades of the county revolutionary committee discovered this ideological trend, they led everyone to study Chairman Mao's statements on class struggle, seriously analyze the class composition and trends of the entire county, and proposed: after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, why do some units continue to fight "internal wars"? Why do some people dare to propose "three up, three down" (remove three committee members and replace them with three others)? This made everyone realize: after the establishment of the county revolutionary committee, class struggle not only did not end but became more acute and complex. The activities of class enemies became more hidden and their methods more vicious. If class struggle is forgotten, the seized power will be lost again, and capitalism will be restored. After unifying their understanding, the committee members immediately united and actively grasped class struggle.

At that time, a counter-current against the revolutionary committee emerged in society. A small handful of class enemies viciously attacked the county revolutionary committee as "rightists in power," attempting to counter-seize power. The county revolutionary committee, which had close ties with the revolutionary masses, immediately understood the enemy's movements after learning about them from the masses. They quickly went deep into the masses, enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought, patiently did ideological and political work, mobilized the masses to actively attack the class enemies, and finally exposed the masterminds behind this counter-current. This villain was a cadre who was removed during the "Four Cleanups," who had tried to infiltrate the revolutionary committee. After his plot failed, he spread rumors and stirred up trouble, using anarchist thoughts to incite some people who did not understand the truth to oppose the county revolutionary committee. At the same time, he sowed discord among the committee members, attempting to overthrow the county revolutionary committee and realize his dream of restoring capitalism. Through this thrilling class struggle, the comrades of the county revolutionary committee clearly realized: after seizing power, the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines still centers on the issue of "power." Only by firmly grasping class struggle can the leadership of the proletariat be consolidated.

The revolutionary committee also realized from this class struggle that it is necessary to closely combine the actual class struggle in the locality, extensively and deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly expose and criticize China's Khrushchev and his agents in Xiushui County in terms of ideology, politics, and organization. Only by doing so can the plots and tricks of the class enemies to reverse the verdict be thoroughly smashed. The county revolutionary committee and revolutionary committees at all levels concentrated their efforts on carrying out revolutionary criticism and ensuring that it continued and deepened. In the revolutionary criticism, the living class struggle facts educated the broad revolutionary masses, raising their awareness of class struggle and line struggle. Some people previously did not fully understand the importance of revolutionary criticism, saying, "China's Khrushchev has never been to Xiushui, so there is no need for a big criticism." However, upon investigation, the black winds of restoring capitalism such as "three selfs and one package" and "four freedoms" were all stirred up by China's Khrushchev and a small handful of capitalist roaders within the party. They hated China's Khrushchev more and more, and managed and criticized the local class enemies who echoed China's Khrushchev more strictly and deeply.

Later, some heads of the original conservative organizations who had not yet truly returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line saw that many cadres had been liberated one after another and said that they had "conserved" correctly in the past. The county revolutionary committee discovered this trend and had a serious discussion, unanimously agreeing that this was a reflection of the struggle between the two lines. If this wrong argument was not refuted, those class enemies with ulterior motives would use this wrong argument to negate the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Therefore, the county revolutionary committee seriously criticized the wrong ideas of the heads of the original conservative organizations and organized cadres who had made mistakes to speak out, checking their past implementation of the bourgeois reactionary line and suppression of the proletarian revolutionary faction. The confessions of these cadres were a lively political lesson for the masses who had been deceived in the past, awakening them and thus preventing the class enemies from finding any opportunity.

The practice of the Xiushui County Revolutionary Committee proved that to grasp power and use it well, it is necessary to firmly grasp class struggle. By grasping class struggle, leadership is consolidated, and initiative is gained; without grasping class struggle, the newly established revolutionary committee will deviate from the masses, go astray, and even gradually change its nature.

Only by representing the masses can one lead the masses

In his latest instructions, Chairman Mao pointed out that the revolutionary committee should "organize a revolutionary and mass-linked leading cadre team." The comrades of the Xiushui County Revolutionary Committee, from the practice of grasping and using power, felt that the newly established revolutionary power, only by closely linking with the masses, sharing their breaths and destinies, truly representing the interests and demands of the masses, standing at the forefront of the masses, and leading the masses to advance victoriously, can it gain the trust and support of the masses, and truly have the leadership and initiative of the revolution.

To closely link with the masses, the Xiushui County Revolutionary Committee, in addition to assigning one member to manage daily work, had the other members frequently go deep into the masses, deep into reality, participate in labor, investigate and study, and solve problems on the spot.

The Xiushui County Revolutionary Committee had five members who were representatives of the revolutionary masses. They fully played the role of linking with the masses. They realized that linking with the masses first required linking with the masses of their own units and doing a good job in their own units to gain experience. They insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works with the masses of their own units, struggling against selfishness and revisionism together, participating in labor together, and making their own units' work vivid and colorful. The committee members included two Red Guards, whose school, Xiushui No. 1 Middle School, was the vanguard of the educational revolution in the county. A worker member's unit, the Hydropower Bureau, was an advanced unit in revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination. Another worker member's unit, the Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, established merits in defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and defending the revolutionary power. The experiences of these units played a very good role in promoting the work of the entire county.

The members of the revolutionary committee, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching of "paying deep attention to the problems of the masses' lives," cared for the masses' lives everywhere, put the actual problems of the masses' lives on their agenda, and seriously studied and solved them. To solve the drinking water problem of the county's urban residents, the committee members took the lead in participating in the labor of dredging river sand and carrying river sand, so that the masses could drink relatively clean river water. Once, after a heavy rain, a street in the county town was flooded, and two comrades of the county revolutionary committee immediately got up and rushed to the scene to participate in the rescue and lead the rescue. A worker member, every time he went to the countryside, carried Chairman Mao's works, documents, and tools with him, propagandized Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the community members at any time, and repaired machines for the production teams when he had time, teaching the community members the methods of maintaining and using machines. A committee member who was a medical worker donated his blood several times when the hospital had critically ill patients who urgently needed blood transfusions, saving the lives of three class brothers. The members of the Xiushui County Revolutionary Committee were like this, sincerely working for the interests of the masses, and they gained the sincere support of the broad masses. The masses praised them: "They are indeed good cadres of Chairman Mao, good leaders of the people of Xiushui!"

Among the members of the revolutionary committee, the oldest was over forty, and the youngest was only nineteen. Some had never done any leadership work, and even if they had been in charge of a department, they lacked experience in leading the entire county. They realized that to lead the 330,000 revolutionary masses of the entire county to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they must actively place themselves under the supervision of the masses, humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, and sincerely accept the criticisms of the masses. The county revolutionary committee had invited the responsible comrades of various revolutionary mass organizations, representatives of the revolutionary masses, and comrades of various offices of the revolutionary committee to come and give opinions seven times. To hear the voices of the broad masses, the comrades of the revolutionary committee often went to various units to solicit the opinions of the masses, going to places with more opinions more frequently. In this way, the members of the revolutionary committee became more heart-to-heart with the masses, and the decisions and calls made by the revolutionary committee were more in line with the demands of the masses, more truly represented the interests of the masses, and work became more proactive.

    牢牢掌握革命的领导权和主动权
    ——记贵州习水县革命委员会掌权用权的斗争实践
    新生的革命委员会，怎样把革命的领导权和主动权牢牢掌握在手里？贵州省习水县革命委员会的经验是：必须在一切工作中坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅；念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，主动带领广大革命群众不停顿地向阶级敌人进攻；紧密联系群众，深切了解群众的动向和要求，不断地从革命的群众运动中吸取朝气蓬勃的革命精神。
    有了毛泽东思想才有领导权
    习水县革命委员会的同志认为：革命委员会最重要的任务，就是革命；革命，就得靠毛泽东思想。他们说：红色政权不是红在一块牌子上，而是红在用毛泽东思想挂帅上，红在“忠于毛主席”五个大字上。
    千头万绪抓根本，天塌地陷不动摇。习水县革委会一成立，就从千头万绪、错综复杂的工作中，抓住了活学活用毛泽东思想这个根本大计，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想把各级革命领导班子和全县三十三万人民武装起来，使县革委会真正掌握革命的领导权和主动权。他们除了建立雷打不动的学习毛主席著作的制度以外，把举办毛泽东思想学习班当作头等重大的政治任务。县革委会主任委员亲自领导举办全县第一期毛泽东思想学习班，委员们分头到县属各系统、各区去抓办学习班的工作。不多久，各种类型的学习班就遍及全县的城镇和乡村，共达五千七百多个，参加学习的人数占全县总人口的百分之七十五。通过大办学习班，毛泽东思想空前大普及，毛主席倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风普遍树立。在革委会委员带头斗私批修、破私立公的榜样的影响下，全县革命群众和革命干部认真落实毛主席的最新指示。全县十二个区、八十五个公社，全部建立了革命委员会，实现了一片红。公社以上干部解放了百分之九十四点六，积极地挑起革命和生产两副担子。革命大联合和革命三结合越来越巩固。县革命委员会在群众中的领导作用越来越发挥出来，工作越来越主动。
    为了领导全县人民夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，习水县革委会把广泛传达和贯彻执行毛主席每一个最新指示，作为当前中心工作的中心。他们从亲身的斗争实践中深刻体会到，只有这样做，才能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，掌握革命的领导权和主动权；否则就会一事被动，事事被动，无法领导全县人民乘胜前进。毛主席发出关于革命委员会基本经验的最新指示的当天，县革委会同志深夜从广播中收听到，当即进行录音，连夜抄印出来，发下去，并且迅速作出决议，要求各级革委会立即掀起宣传、学习和执行毛主席这一最新指示的高潮，作到家喻户晓。县革委会还遵照毛主席的指示，着手减少重叠的机构，改变办事机关人浮于事的现象。
    县革委会同志还认为，宣传毛泽东思想，贯彻毛主席指示，要充分依靠群众中的积极分子。因此，全县通过大办学习班，在贫下中农、民兵和基层革命干部中，培养和训练了数以万计的毛泽东思想宣传员和学习辅导员，使每个生产队都有了负责宣传和领导学习的骨干，从组织上保证了活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的深入开展。现在，学习毛主席著作，已成为全县革命群众生活的第一需要。六十多岁的贫农社员王二妈，不但天天坚持学习，还把自己解放前后的经历编成表演唱，来教育年轻的一代。她唱道：“青年们，要牢记，翻身不忘毛主席；幸福全靠共产党，永远忠于毛主席。”
    县革委会抓住了用毛泽东思想统帅一切这一根本，就牢牢地掌握了革命的领导权和主动权。今年四月份以前，县革委会总共只有八个委员，其中五个还是半脱产的。人少事繁，经验又不足，可是各项任务都完成得很出色。他们深有体会地说：按照毛泽东思想办事，就事事主动，离开了毛泽东思想，就一事无成。
    狠抓阶级斗争才能巩固领导权
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”习水县革委会的同志回顾夺权以来带领广大革命群众主动地不停顿地进行阶级斗争的经历，更加体会到毛主席这一最新指示的深刻意义。
    县革委会成立初期，有些同志产生了和平麻痹思想，认为走资派打倒了，可以“马放南山，刀枪入库”了。县革委会负责同志一发现这种活思想，就领导大家学习了毛主席关于阶级斗争的论述，认真分析了全县的阶级阵容和各阶级的动向，并且提出：革委会成立后，为什么不少单位继续打“内战”，为什么有的人竟敢提出“三上三下”（撤销三个委员，另换三个人）？这样，就使大家清醒过来：县革委会成立后，阶级斗争不但没有结束，而且更尖锐，更复杂，阶级敌人的活动更隐蔽，手段更毒辣；如果忘记了阶级斗争，夺得的政权就会重新丧失，资本主义就要复辟。认识统一后，革委会成员立即齐心协力，主动地狠抓阶级斗争。
    当时正值社会上出现了一股反对革命委员会的逆流，一小撮阶级敌人恶毒地攻击县革委会是“右派掌权”，妄图进行反夺权。同革命群众有密切联系的县革委会，及时了解了敌人的动向后，立刻分头深入到群众中去，热情宣传毛泽东思想，耐心作思想政治工作，发动群众向阶级敌人主动进攻，终于揪出了这股逆流的幕后操纵者。这个坏家伙是四清中下台的干部，曾经削尖了脑壳，向革命委员会里钻。阴谋没有得逞后，他一方面煽阴风，点鬼火，利用无政府主义思潮，煽动一些不明真相的人，大反县革委会；另一方面又在革委会委员中挑拨离间，妄图一举攻垮县革委会，实现他复辟资本主义的野心。经过这场惊心动魄的阶级斗争，县革委会的同志清楚地认识到：夺权以后，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，仍然集中在一个“权”字上，只有狠抓阶级斗争，才能巩固无产阶级的领导权。
    县革委会从这场阶级斗争中同时认识到，一定要密切结合当地阶级斗争的实际，广泛深入地开展革命大批判，从思想上、政治上、组织上把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在习水县的代理人批深批透，挖掉根子，肃清流毒，才能彻底粉碎阶级敌人妄图翻案的阴谋诡计。县革委会和各级革委会集中力量狠抓革命大批判，并使其持久地深入地进行下去。在革命大批判中，活生生的阶级斗争事实教育了广大革命群众，提高了他们的阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟。原先有些人对革命大批判的重要意义认识不足，说什么“中国赫鲁晓夫也没有到我们习水来过，没有好大批判头”；但是一追查，什么“三自一包”、“四大自由”等复辟资本主义的黑风，都是中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派刮起来的，他们对中国赫鲁晓夫越来越恨，对本地那些和中国赫鲁晓夫一唱一和的阶级敌人，就管得越严，批得越深。
    后来，又有一些尚未真正回到毛主席革命路线上来的原保守组织的头头，看到大批干部先后解放出来了，就说他们过去“保”对了。县革委会发现了这一苗头，进行了认真的讨论，一致认为，这是两条路线斗争的反映，不驳倒这种错误论调，那些别有用心的阶级敌人，就要利用这种错误论调来否定无产阶级文化大革命。于是，县革委会严肃地批判了原保守组织头头的错误，又组织犯错误的干部现身说法，检查他们过去是怎样执行资产阶级反动路线，怎样镇压无产阶级革命派的。这些干部的检查，对过去受蒙蔽的群众是一堂生动的政治课，启发他们觉悟过来，从而使阶级敌人无机可乘。
    习水县革委会的实践证明，要掌好权用好权，必须狠抓阶级斗争。抓了阶级斗争，就巩固了领导权，有了主动权；不抓阶级斗争，新生的革命委员会就会脱离群众，就会走上邪路，甚至逐渐变质。
    只有代表群众才能领导群众
    毛主席在最新指示中指出，革命委员会要“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”。习水县革命委员会的同志从掌权用权的实践过程中体会到，新生的革命政权，只有密切联系群众，和群众同呼吸共命运，真正代表群众的利益和要求，站在群众的前面，带领群众胜利前进，才能得到群众的信任和支持，才算真正有了革命的领导权和主动权。
    为了密切联系群众，习水县革委会除分工由一名委员管理日常工作外，其余的委员都经常深入群众，深入实际，参加劳动，调查研究，在下面解决问题。
    习水县革委会有五位委员是革命群众的代表。他们充分发挥了联系群众的长处。他们认识到，联系群众首先就要联系好本单位的群众，把本单位的工作搞好，从中取得经验。他们坚持与本单位群众一起学习毛主席著作，一起斗私批修，一起参加劳动，把本单位工作搞得有声有色。革委会成员中有两个是红卫兵小将，他们所在的习水一中是全县教育革命的先锋。一个工人委员所在的水电局，是革命大联合和革命三结合的先进单位。另一个工人委员所在的邮电局，在保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线、保卫革命政权的斗争中建立了功勋。这几个单位的经验对推动全县工作起了很好的作用。
    县革委会的成员，遵照毛主席关于“我们应该深刻地注意群众生活的问题”的教导，处处关心群众生活，把群众的实际生活问题，提到自己的议事日程上，认真研究和解决。为了解决县城人民的饮水问题，革委会成员带头参加淘河沙、背河沙的劳动，使群众能喝上比较干净的河水。有一次暴雨之后，县城里淹了一条街，县革委会两位同志立即起床奔赴现场参加抢救，领导抢救。有个工人委员，每次下乡，毛主席著作、文件和工具随身带，随时随地向社员群众宣传毛主席最新指示，抽空为生产队修理机器，并且把维修使用机器的方法传授给社员。有一个革委会委员是医务人员，好几次医院来了重病人急需输血，他毫不犹豫地献出自己的鲜血，先后抢救了三个阶级兄弟的生命。习水县革委会成员就是这样真心实意地为群众谋利益，他们得到了广大群众的真心实意的拥护。群众称赞他们：“真是毛主席的好干部，我们习水人民的好带头人！”
    县革委会成员中，年纪最大的四十多岁，最小的才十九岁。有的根本没有做过领导工作，有的即使担负过一个部门的领导工作，也缺少领导全县的经验。他们认识到，为了带领全县三十三万革命群众夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利，必须主动地把自己置身在群众监督之下，虚心听取群众的意见，诚恳接受群众的批评。县革委会曾七次邀请各革命群众组织的负责人，革命群众的代表和革委会各办事机构的同志来提意见。为了听到广大群众的呼声，革委会的同志经常深入各单位征求群众意见，那里有意见就到那里去。意见越大的地方越是常去。这样，革委会成员就和群众更加心贴心了，革委会作出的决定和发出的号召，就更加符合群众的要求，更加切实地代表了群众的利益，工作起来就更加主动了。　本报记者
