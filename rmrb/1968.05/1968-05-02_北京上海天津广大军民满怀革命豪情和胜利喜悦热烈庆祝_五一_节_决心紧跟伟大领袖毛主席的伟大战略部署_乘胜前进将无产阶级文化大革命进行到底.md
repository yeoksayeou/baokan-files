The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangdong, filled with revolutionary fervor and the joy of victory, enthusiastically celebrated May Day, the international labor holiday. They resolved to closely follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, the great leader, to press forward with victory, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

They must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, carry forward the resolute and thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, continue to focus on class struggle, launch more vigorous attacks on the enemies of the proletariat, closely combine the revolutionary mass criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in each unit, further develop the excellent situation, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the unprecedentedly good situation both internationally and domestically, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, the broad revolutionary masses, and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in our great capital, Beijing, enthusiastically celebrated the international labor holiday of May Day, enthusiastically hailed the unprecedented victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, enthusiastically hailed the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and enthusiastically hailed the entry of the world revolution into a great new era. They resolved to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, press forward with victory, and launch vigorous attacks on the enemies of the proletariat, further develop the excellent situation, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, more powerfully supporting the revolutionary struggles of the proletariat and oppressed peoples and nations around the world.

The Tiananmen Square, the heart of the capital, was particularly magnificent and grand. The giant portrait of Mao Zedong, the great leader of the proletariat, hung high in the center of the red wall of the Tiananmen Gate. The giant portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin stood tall on both sides of Tiananmen Square. On the high billboards on the east and west sides of Tiananmen Square, revolutionary slogans of the unity and struggle of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world were written. Red flags fluttered in every street and alley of the city, and revolutionary slogans were posted everywhere: "Workers of the world, unite! Workers of the world, unite with the oppressed peoples and nations!" "Firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries!" "Salute to the Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations of all countries! Firmly support the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles of all Marxist-Leninists around the world!" "Long live the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Learn from the great People's Liberation Army of China! Salute to the great People's Liberation Army of China!" "Long live the heroic Chinese people!" "Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!" "Long live great Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

The revolutionary workers of various fronts such as industry, transportation, urban construction, commerce, and services, the revolutionary community members of suburban people's communes, the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing, as well as the broad Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary residents, have been holding mass rallies, symposiums, cultural performances, and demonstrations in recent days. They celebrated May Day, the international labor holiday, with the actual actions of further implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, deepening the revolutionary mass criticism, focusing on the revolution, and vigorously promoting production.

Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, the working class of the capital has fully played the role of the main force, making great contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Recently, they have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instruction: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the socialist conditions, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the broad revolutionary masses led by the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The broad revolutionary workers have armed themselves with this latest instruction of Chairman Mao, further carried forward the resolute and thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, continued to focus on class struggle in the excellent situation, launched more vigorous attacks on the enemies of the proletariat, closely combined the revolutionary mass criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in each unit, and carried it out more extensively and deeply. They have struck China's Khrushchev and other small cliques of capitalist roaders within the Party, as well as traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries, accurately, fiercely, and steadily. The revolutionary and production situation is getting better and better.

Today, the revolutionary workers of Beijing Coal Bureau's Mucity Gorge Coal Mine, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and deep hatred for China's Khrushchev and his agents, have set up revolutionary mass criticism battlefields in workshops, sections, workshops, and offices, fighting against the small cliques of capitalist roaders within the Party, as well as traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries, launching vigorous attacks on the class enemies. The representatives attending the first meeting of active learners and users of Mao Zedong Thought organized by the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Railway Bureau held a celebration and symposium for May Day. The representatives expressed that they would firmly oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, smash the right opportunist reversal wind, and firmly root out all the harmful elements hidden in the railway department. The representative of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive crew said, "To be a thorough proletarian revolutionary, we must better master Mao Zedong Thought, this most powerful weapon, and launch vigorous and sustained attacks on the enemies of the proletariat, completely defeating them!"

The revolutionary workers of Beijing Knitting Factory, a model of following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and the support-left personnel of the People's Liberation Army's 8341st Unit, held a grand meeting to enthusiastically celebrate May Day, the international labor holiday. They raised the banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," singing "The Red Sun Shines on Beijing Knitting Factory" together on stage. They seriously studied the editorial "Pressing Forward with Victory" from the People's Daily, Red Flag, and Liberation Army Daily, unanimously expressing that they would strive to learn from and apply Mao Zedong Thought, raise the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the proletariat, carry forward the resolute and thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary mass criticism, and be proletarian revolutionaries determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The revolutionary workers of Beijing Steel Plant and the support-left personnel of the People's Liberation Army held a celebration and parade for May Day. Standing in front of the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," they solemnly swore that they would resolutely implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, carry forward the resolute and thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and press forward with victory.

Many factory workers pointed out during the celebration of May Day that the proletarian revolutionaries must be good at uniting their own class forces and good at uniting and winning over allies, uniting the vast majority. The responsible comrades of the Beijing Workers' Revolutionary Congress said in the holiday that they had listened to the broadcast of the editorial "Pressing Forward with Victory" from the People's Daily, Red Flag, and Liberation Army Daily, excitedly saying, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The proletariat not only wants to liberate itself but also wants to liberate all mankind. If it cannot liberate all mankind, the proletariat itself cannot ultimately be liberated.' The working class is the leading class of the revolution and must strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, unite the broad revolutionary masses, and fight against the enemy together, thus completely isolating the enemy and defeating the enemy." They said, "We must more consciously act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, unite all forces that can be united, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!"

The revolutionary workers of New China Printing Factory held various criticism meetings in recent days, fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev and other major cliques of capitalist roaders within the Party, using revolutionary mass criticism to commemorate May Day, the international labor holiday. The revolutionary workers said, "We Chinese working class firmly remember that there are still many laboring people in the world who have not been liberated and are still suffering in deep water and fire. We must, with the actual actions of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, more powerfully support the revolutionary struggles of the proletariat and oppressed peoples and nations around the world."

The revolutionary workers of many units such as Beijing Foreign Language Printing Factory, Beijing Paper Mill, and Beijing Vinylon Factory all celebrated May Day with new achievements in revolution and production. In Beijing Foreign Language Printing Factory, as soon as the celebration meeting for May Day, the international labor holiday, ended, the support-left soldiers of the stationed People's Liberation Army, the members of the Revolutionary Committee of the factory, and many revolutionary workers rushed to the workshop to participate in a hot and heavy voluntary labor, quickly and well printing the single-volume foreign language edition of "Statement by Chairman Mao Zedong in Support of the Struggle of the Black People in the United States Against Violence." In the five days before the holiday, they had already printed more than 780,000 copies of this single-volume foreign language edition of Chairman Mao's great statement, exceeding the plan by more than 50%. This factory's printing of various foreign language editions of Chairman Mao's works in 1967 exceeded the total of the past 16 years, and in the first four months of this year, it has again overfulfilled the task. The revolutionary workers in the workshop, with a global perspective, excitedly said: "The more we print Chairman Mao's works, the more we contribute to the world revolution!" During the holiday, the revolutionary workers of foreign language bookstores, international bookstores, and New China Bookstore branches scattered across cities and countryside sent millions of copies of Chairman Mao's works and millions of portraits of Chairman Mao to the broad workers, peasants, and soldiers and international friends. The broad workers, peasants, and soldiers and revolutionary youngsters received the revolutionary treasures and portraits of Chairman Mao, excited and moved, shouting: "Long live great Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

The holiday celebration activities of the broad community members of suburban people's communes in Beijing were full of revolutionary fervor. Some held mass rallies to study the important editorial "Pressing Forward with Victory" from the People's Daily, Red Flag, and Liberation Army Daily; some held village and field criticism meetings to fiercely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of China's Khrushchev. The Revolutionary Committee of Pinggu County proposed a new battle task on the eve of the holiday, determined to further arm the people of the whole county with Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen the revolutionary great unity of the revolutionary people of the whole county, launch more vigorous attacks on the enemies of the proletariat, fiercely strike the small cliques of capitalist roaders who are stubborn and unrepentant, as well as traitors, spies, and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed, sweep away all harmful elements, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The militiamen of the Keqiao Brigade of Lugouqiao People's Commune said in a symposium that they had seriously studied the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao: "We not only need a strong regular army, but we also need to establish a large number of militia regiments. Thus, when imperialism invades our country, they will find it difficult to move an inch." They excitedly said: "We, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Lugouqiao, will never forget the anti-Japanese flames that once burned here and will never forget to firmly fight against the class enemies at home and abroad. We will forever command the gun with Mao Zedong Thought, defend the iron fortress of the proletariat. We will firmly defeat imperialism led by the United States, defeat modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership, and defeat the reactionaries of all countries. We will firmly defeat the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and liberate Taiwan." In the holiday rally of Zhong-Albanian Friendship People's Commune, the poor and lower-middle peasant community members expressed their firm support for the great leader Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of black people in the United States against violence, highly praising the new victories of the struggle of black people in the United States against violence, the new victories of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation, and the new victories of the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. The workers from nearby factories, the soldiers and officers of the stationed troops, and the community members present at the rally unanimously toasted the long life of the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao! They also performed artistic performances, enthusiastically singing the heroic spirit of the Albanian people, who hold a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, fearlessly resisting imperialism and revisionism.

The leading organs of the People's Liberation Army's various general departments, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, the National Defense Industry Office, various military services and branches, as well as the Beijing Military Region, and the units in Beijing, the garrison troops of Beijing, and the broad soldiers and officers executing the "three supports and two militarizations" tasks in Beijing, held celebration meetings, symposiums, and report meetings, enthusiastically celebrating May Day, the international labor holiday. Many units sent Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to the streets, deeply entering factories, mines, villages, and schools, using various forms to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the excellent revolutionary situation at home and abroad, and the battle tasks we face. The soldiers and officers of the first company of a certain unit of the Beijing Garrison, who guard day and night in front of Tiananmen, held activities to welcome May Day, the international labor holiday, and to express loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao before the holiday arrived. They said, "We will be in Tiananmen, with a global perspective, and will never forget class struggle, forever holding the gun in our hands, defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and achieving new merits in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." In the celebration meeting of the fifth company of a certain unit of the Beijing Garrison, which is on duty at the Beijing Revolutionary Committee, the soldiers and officers made ironclad vows: "We, the guards armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will defend the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, with our lives, defend the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and defend the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We will firmly defend the newly born revolutionary committees and further consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat." In the holiday joint celebration meeting of military and civilians in Daxinzhuang Production Brigade of Zhangjiawan People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing, the broad poor and lower-middle peasant community members and all the soldiers and officers of the stationed certain company stood shoulder to shoulder in front of the great leader Chairman Mao, jointly expressing that they would further raise the banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," strengthen military-civilian unity, forever follow Chairman Mao to make the revolution, and firmly carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

The Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students of the capital's schools, who have grown up in the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, celebrated May Day, the international labor holiday, in a fighting posture. Many schools held celebration meetings or joint celebration meetings of military and civilians, some schools held symposiums on learning from and applying Chairman Mao's works, bitter-sweet remembrance reports, and various revolutionary mass criticism meetings. They resolved to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, burn the fire of revolutionary mass criticism more fiercely, launch sustained and vigorous attacks on the enemies of the proletariat, carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end, and not retreat until complete victory is achieved. The broad Red Guard youngsters of the capital expressed their firm will to support the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world when celebrating May Day, the international labor holiday. They said, "We revolutionary Red Guards will forever raise the revolutionary banner of 'it is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries,' fiercely oppose the United States, fiercely oppose the Soviet revisionists, fiercely oppose the reactionaries of all countries, and fight shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary people of the world, swearing to sweep all the monsters and demons into the garbage dump of history."

The broad revolutionary residents of the streets of Beijing held various holiday celebration activities. They resolved to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, organize and run Mao Zedong Thought study classes well, focus on class struggle, carry out revolutionary mass criticism, eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism spread by China's Khrushchev and other small cliques of capitalist roaders within the Party, and vow to turn the streets into a red Mao Zedong Thought university.

In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the working class of Shanghai, the broad laboring people, and the soldiers and officers of the navy, air force, and army stationed in Shanghai, filled with revolutionary fervor and the joy of victory, enthusiastically celebrated May Day, the international labor holiday of the unity and struggle of the proletariat and laboring people of the world.

Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, Shanghai today presents a revolutionary scene full of vitality and vigor, filled with a hot atmosphere of unity and struggle. From the main streets of the city center to the banks of the Huangpu River, giant portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao are hung on tall buildings, and giant slogans celebrating May Day, the international labor holiday, are posted. Red flags flutter everywhere in the city, and the atmosphere is festive. Today, various celebration activities are held in many factories, shops, schools, offices, streets, barracks, and suburban people's communes. Some famous advanced workers in Shanghai held symposiums to celebrate May Day, the international labor holiday. People at these meetings enthusiastically shouted: "Long live the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Long live great Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!

"Down with modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership!" "Down with the reactionaries of all countries!" "Workers of the world, unite! Workers of the world, unite with the oppressed peoples and nations!"

The Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory, which Chairman Mao personally inspected seven years ago on May Day, held a grand and solemn celebration meeting on the eve of the holiday. They solemnly swore to Chairman Mao, the great leader: "Forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever following Chairman Mao, forever advancing along the course indicated by Chairman Mao, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and forging ourselves into proletarian revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought, truly representing the interests of the proletariat and the broad laboring masses." The soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the East China Fleet and the revolutionary teachers and students of East China Institute of Chemical Technology jointly held a celebration meeting for May Day. The military and civilians enthusiastically cheered for the entry of the world into a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner.

The leading comrades of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee today went to factories, docks, and other grassroots units, celebrating May Day, the international labor holiday with the revolutionary masses, and studying the important editorial "Pressing Forward with Victory" with the masses. The Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters held an expanded meeting of commissioners today to celebrate the brilliant holiday of the proletariat and laboring people of the world.

Several hundred proletarian revolutionary warriors and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army jointly studied the important editorial "Pressing Forward with Victory," discussing the current excellent situation at home and abroad. At the meeting, many revolutionary warriors pointed out that the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai is the great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We Shanghai proletarian revolutionary warriors must resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, strictly distinguish between class enemies and internal contradictions among the people, unite all forces that can be united, expand our class forces, believe in and rely on the great People's Liberation Army of China, and play the role of the main force in the fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, achieving new victories. They firmly expressed that they would not relax their fighting will because of victory and must follow Chairman Mao's great teaching of "it is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage than to seek fame by learning from the king of Chu," hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, direct the spearhead of the struggle firmly at the small cliques of class enemies, deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary mass criticism, thoroughly expose China's Khrushchev and other major cliques of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents in Shanghai, eliminate their poison, root out all hidden class enemies, and push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from victory to new victories without stopping.

Today, many factory workers in Shanghai are still insisting on production during the holiday. They follow Chairman Mao's great teaching of "grasp revolution, promote production," determined to support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with greater production achievements, support the socialist construction of the motherland, and support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries.

Today, they are still insisting on production by the roaring steel furnaces, starting a new battle to achieve greater production achievements in May. The Shanghai Wujin Chemical Plant completed the manufacturing task of the first domestic self-designed, manufactured, and constructed methanol project five months ahead of schedule on the eve of May Day.

Workers of the world, unite with the oppressed peoples and nations!" "Long live great Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!

The responsible comrades of the Tianjin Revolutionary Committee and the responsible comrades of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tianjin attended the celebration meeting held by the Tianjin Workers' Congress. The representative of the Tianjin Workers' Congress spoke at the celebration meeting, saying, "The great leader Chairman Mao recently taught us: 'The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the socialist conditions, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the broad revolutionary masses led by the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.' Chairman Mao's latest instruction further indicates the direction of the current struggle. We, the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses of the whole city, must closely follow the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, learn from and apply Mao Zedong Thought, focus on revolutionary mass criticism, raise the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the proletariat, unite the broad revolutionary masses, firmly oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, thoroughly smash the right opportunist reversal wind, further carry forward the resolute and thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, launch sustained and vigorous attacks on the enemies of the proletariat, thoroughly expose China's Khrushchev and other small cliques of capitalist roaders within the Party, root out all hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries, consolidate and develop the great alliance and three-in-one combination, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and make the revolution and production better and better."

Today, Tianjin is full of red flags, and large slogans celebrating May Day, the international labor holiday, are posted everywhere. Many factories, schools, offices, streets, and military barracks hold celebration activities. The city is filled with a revolutionary atmosphere of unity and struggle. Many factory workers studied the editorial "Pressing Forward with Victory" from the People's Daily, Red Flag, and Liberation Army Daily and held symposiums. The workers of the Second Cotton Textile Mill of Tianjin said in the symposium that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, the working class and the broad revolutionary masses have long struggled against the Kuomintang reactionaries, overthrowing the three big mountains that had been pressing on our heads. We will never forget the brilliant and arduous battle course that Chairman Mao led us through. We, the working class, suffered the most exploitation and deepest oppression in the old society. We understand the viciousness of the bourgeoisie and the brutality of the Kuomintang reactionaries the best. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," never be arrogant, complacent, or slack because of victory, and must press forward with victory, thoroughly smash all sabotage plots of the small cliques of unrepentant capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The dock workers of Tianjin New Port said in a symposium today: "When we, the dock workers of New Port, and the proletariat and revolutionary people of the whole country and the world celebrate this brilliant holiday of May Day together, we must remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of 'the people who have already achieved revolutionary victory should aid the struggle for liberation of those who are still struggling for it. This is our internationalist duty,' with a global perspective, holding high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, more powerfully supporting the struggles of the proletariat and oppressed peoples and nations around the world against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, contributing our strength to the struggle for the complete liberation of all mankind." The dock workers said, "To complete this sublime task, we must fight resolutely and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. In this struggle, we must remember Chairman Mao's teaching of 'winning over all people who can be won over,' forming a mighty revolutionary army, isolating and firmly striking the small cliques of class enemies to the greatest extent."

The working class, revolutionary masses, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in Tianjin expressed in the holiday celebration activities that they would further raise the banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," more enthusiastically carry out the movement of supporting the army and loving the people, strengthen military-civilian unity, further consolidate and strengthen the iron wall of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The revolutionary workers of Tianjin First Printing Factory, who completed the glorious task of printing "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" ahead of schedule last year, said in a symposium today, "In the storm of class struggle, the People's Liberation Army and we have weathered the storm together and are our strong backing. We must do a better job of supporting the army and be more closely united with the great People's Liberation Army of China, fighting together to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"
