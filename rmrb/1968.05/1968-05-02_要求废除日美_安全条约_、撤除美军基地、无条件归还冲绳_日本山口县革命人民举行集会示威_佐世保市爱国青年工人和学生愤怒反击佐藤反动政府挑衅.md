Revolutionary People and Patriots in Yamaguchi Prefecture Hold Rally and Demonstration
Youth Workers and Students in Sasebo City Angrily Counter Sato's Reactionary Government's Provocation

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Tokyo on the 30th, on the 28th, revolutionary people and patriots in Yamaguchi Prefecture held a rally and demonstration in Hofu City, demanding the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the removal of U.S. military bases, and the immediate and unconditional return of Okinawa. They bravely fought against the armed police who came to suppress them.

On the afternoon of the 28th, the revolutionary people and patriots of Yamaguchi Prefecture, with deep hatred for American imperialism and its lackeys, held a rally in Hofu City, where the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" base is located.

Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee (Left Wing) of the Japanese Communist Party representative Kageyama Haruo, in his speech at the rally, called on the attendees to unite closely with the broad masses of workers and people of Japan, to further develop the anti-American patriotic struggle, and to play a role in the international anti-American struggle.

Kageyama highly praised the great leader Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. He said, "Our anti-American patriotic struggle in Japan is also a part of the international anti-American struggle. As long as we respond to Chairman Mao's great call, launch a sustained and fierce attack on American imperialism and its lackeys, we will surely achieve victory."

The secretary-general of the Yamaguchi Prefecture General Branch of the Japanese Socialist Party, Suzuki Atsuo, and a representative of the Yamaguchi Prefecture General Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) also spoke at the meeting.

After the rally, the crowd, holding up large portraits of Chairman Mao, Mao's quotations, and many banners, marched in high spirits.

The panicked Sato reactionary government mobilized a large number of fully armed police to brutally suppress the demonstrators, illegally arresting eleven demonstrators and savagely beating them.

The enemy's brutal suppression did not frighten the spirited demonstrators. The demonstrators immediately launched a long sit-in struggle, strongly protesting against the fascist atrocities of the Japanese police authorities. Despite the police's layer-by-layer encirclement, they marched forward, singing Mao's quotations: "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, surmounting every difficulty to win victory." They also shouted slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

The revolutionary people and patriots of Japan fully demonstrated their fearless revolutionary heroism in this struggle.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 27th, according to a report from the Oriental News Agency, in Sasebo City, Nagasaki Prefecture, an important base of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, on the 27th, more than seventy Japanese patriotic youth workers and students bravely charged the armed "parade" of the Japanese "Maritime Self-Defense Force" on the streets, dealing a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialism and Sato's reactionary government's attempt to display the strength of Japanese militarism.

The Sato reactionary government, under the pretext of "celebrating" the completion of the new building of the Sasebo District Command of the "Maritime Self-Defense Force," directed the "Maritime Self-Defense Force" to hold this armed "parade." Its evil purpose is to try to display the strength of Japanese militarism through the "parade," threaten the people of Sasebo, and maintain the safety of its American master's military base in Sasebo.

The Sato reactionary government's blatant provocation enraged the people of Sasebo City.

On the 27th, when about five hundred "Maritime Self-Defense Force" officers and soldiers marched in formation to the busiest street in Sasebo City, they were immediately charged by a group of young workers and students. The "Maritime Self-Defense Force" was in a state of disarray under the charge of these patriotic youth and students.

　　要求废除日美“安全条约”、撤除美军基地、无条件归还冲绳
　　日本山口县革命人民举行集会示威
　　佐世保市爱国青年工人和学生愤怒反击佐藤反动政府挑衅
    据新华社东京三十日电　日本山口县革命人民和爱国人士二十八日在防府市举行集会和示威，要求废除日美“安全条约”、撤除美国军事基地和立即无条件地归还冲绳。他们同前来镇压的武装警察进行了英勇搏斗。
    四月二十八日下午，山口县革命人民和爱国人士怀着对美帝国主义及其帮凶们的无比仇恨，在设有日本“自卫队”基地的防府市举行了集会。
    日本共产党山口县委员会（左派）代表影山春雄在集会上讲话时，号召与会者同日本广大工人、广大人民群众紧密团结起来，进一步开展反美爱国斗争，发挥日本人民在国际反美斗争中的作用。
    影山高度赞扬了伟大领袖毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。他说，我们日本人民的反美爱国斗争，也是国际上反美斗争的一个组成部分。只要我们响应毛主席的伟大号召，向着美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻，就一定能够取得胜利。
    日本社会党山口县总部书记长椙山敦男、日中友好协会（正统）山口县总部的代表也在会上讲了话。
    大会结束后，群众高举毛主席的巨幅画像、毛主席语录牌以及许多标语牌，斗志昂扬地举行了示威游行。
    慌了手脚的日本佐藤反动政府调动了大批全副武装的警察对示威群众进行野蛮镇压，悍然非法逮捕示威群众十一名，并且野蛮殴打示威群众。
    敌人的野蛮镇压，吓不倒斗志昂扬的示威群众。示威群众立即展开了长时间的静坐斗争，对日本警察当局的法西斯暴行提出了强烈抗议。他们不顾警察的层层包围，雄赳赳、气昂昂地高唱毛主席语录歌：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”并且高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”等口号。日本革命人民和爱国人士在这场斗争中充分显示了他们大无畏的革命英雄气概。
    据新华社二十七日讯　据东方通讯社报道，在美国第七舰队的重要基地日本长崎县佐世保市，二十七日有七十多名日本爱国青年工人和学生英勇地冲击了在街上举行武装“游行”的日本“海上自卫队”，沉重地打击了美帝国主义和佐藤反动政府企图显示日本军国主义力量的阴谋。
  　佐藤反动政府是以“庆祝”“海上自卫队”佐世保区司令部新大楼完工为借口，而指使“海上自卫队”举行这次武装“游行”的。它的罪恶目的是妄图通过“游行”显示日本军国主义力量，威胁佐世保人民，以维护其美国主子在佐世保的军事基地的安全。
    佐藤反动政府这种悍然向人民挑衅的行为，激起了佐世保市人民的愤慨。
    二十七日，当约五百名“海上自卫队”官兵荷枪列队“游行”到佐世保市区最繁华的街道时，立即遭到一队青年工人和学生的冲击。“海上自卫队”在这些爱国青年和学生的冲击下狼狈不堪。
