In Paris, students and teachers opposing the current French educational system have, after a week of bloody struggle against the police sent to suppress them, continued their struggle.

Under the pressure of public opinion and the courageous fight of Paris students and teachers over the past few days, Paris University President Jean Roche, after a four-hour tense meeting with the deans of various colleges, announced the revocation of the decision to close Paris University. However, on the same day, French Education Minister Edgar Faure, citing that the situation had not yet "returned to normal," insisted that Paris University must remain closed. This flip-flopping behavior by the French authorities has sparked great indignation among students and teachers.

On the afternoon of the 9th, more than three thousand Paris University students gathered on the Rue Saint-Michel in the heart of the Latin Quarter (the university district) to protest against the French government. Traffic in this area was paralyzed as a result. The French government dispatched a large number of police, equipped with steel helmets, shields, rifles, batons, tear gas, and smoke bombs, to form multiple human barriers, blocking the passage and preventing students from entering their own university. Student representatives, speaking to the crowd, said: "As long as the government does not meet our three demands—release the arrested protesters, stop all persecution of them; withdraw the police from the university district; and revoke the closure of Paris University and the Sorbonne—we will continue the general strike and continue the struggle."

Currently, the student movement in Paris is expanding from universities to high schools. Many high schools in Paris have teachers on strike and students on strike, supporting the struggle of Paris University students. In the past two days, several groups of high school students have marched and demonstrated on the streets of Paris, with more than three thousand people alone on the 10th. They shouted slogans such as "Oppose police suppression!" and "Students and workers unite!" as they marched through the bustling streets of Paris.

People from all walks of life in France generally sympathize with and support the struggle of Paris students, and condemn the government's violence. Even the bourgeois-controlled French public opinion polling agency had to admit in a statistic released on the 9th that the vast majority of people in Paris believe that the students' demands are justified.

The just struggle of French students has also gained widespread support in other Western European countries. Representatives of students from Rome and Madrid arrived in the Paris University district on the evening of the 9th to express their support for the struggling Paris students. A thousand Paris University students warmly welcomed the representatives of the two countries at the largest conference hall in the Latin Quarter—the Hall of Unity. Banners on the walls of the conference hall read: "We will use revolutionary violence to counter the violence of the bourgeoisie." Two representatives from West Berlin students arrived in Paris on the 9th but were stopped by the French authorities at the airport and unable to attend the meeting.

In the face of the surging student movement in France, the leaders of the French revisionist group, who had repeatedly attacked the just struggle of Paris students, suddenly transformed themselves, speaking sweetly, attempting to deceive the students, and cover up their traitorous and scab-like faces. French revisionist leader Roger Garaudy issued a statement on the 9th, hypocritically expressing "support" for the students' demands. French revisionist writer Louis Aragon also mingled with the student crowd, seized the loudspeaker, and used his silver tongue to try to justify the repeated attacks on the students' just struggle published in L'Humanité. However, the more the crowd listened, the more they felt something was wrong, and they booed him on the spot. This revisionist was embarrassed and had to slink away.

    在人民广泛支持和同情下
    巴黎学生和教师不畏强暴坚持斗争
    法修头面人物玩弄假支持阴谋妄图欺骗学生被群众当场哄走
    新华社十日讯　巴黎消息：反对法国现行教育制度的巴黎学生和教师，在同前来镇压的警察进行了历时一周的浴血搏斗之后，目前仍在坚持斗争。
    在巴黎学生、教师连日来的英勇斗争以及社会舆论的压力下，巴黎大学校长让·罗什九日在同各学院院长进行了四个多小时紧张会议之后，宣布撤销封闭巴黎大学的决定。但是就在这一天，法国教育部长佩雷菲特马上借口局势还未“恢复平静”，巴黎大学仍然必须继续封闭。法国当局这种出尔反尔的行为，在学生和教师当中激起了很大的愤慨。
    九日下午，巴黎大学生三千多人，聚集在巴黎拉丁区（大学区）中心圣米歇尔大街上，对法国当局表示抗议。这个地区的交通因此陷于瘫痪。法国政府派遣大批头戴钢盔，手执钢盾，步枪、警棍、催泪弹、烟幕弹满身披挂的警察，肩并着肩地筑起多道人墙，挡住通道，不让学生进入自己的大学。学生代表们在向群众讲话时说：只要政府不满足我们提出的三点要求——释放被捕的示威者，停止对他们进行任何迫害；撤走大学区的警察；撤销封闭巴黎大学和农泰尔文学院的决定，那末我们就坚持总罢课，坚持斗争下去。
    目前，巴黎的学生运动，正在从大学向中学扩展。巴黎有不少中学，教师罢教，学生罢课，支持巴黎大学生的斗争。这两天，巴黎街头上出现了好几支中学生游行示威的队伍，仅十日就有三千多人。他们高呼：“反对警察镇压！”“学生工人团结起来！”等口号，昂首阔步地穿过巴黎的闹市。
    法国各阶层人士普遍同情和支持巴黎学生的斗争，并且谴责政府的暴行。甚至连法国民意测验所这样的资产阶级控制的机构九日发表的统计，也不得不承认巴黎绝大多数人认为学生的要求是正当的。
    法国学生的正义斗争，在西欧各国也获得广泛的支持。罗马和马德里大学生的代表九日晚亲自来到巴黎大学区，向斗争中的巴黎学生表示意大利和西班牙学生的支持。一千名巴黎大学生在拉丁区最大的会议厅——团结宫热烈欢迎这两国的代表。会议厅墙上挂着的横幅标语写道：“我们要以革命的暴力对付资产阶级的暴力。”西柏林学生的两名代表九日也来到巴黎，但在机场上被法国当局拦阻，未能参加这次会议。
    在法国学生运动高涨的形势下，不久前还一再攻击巴黎学生正义斗争的法国修正主义集团的头面人物，这两天忽然摇身一变，满口甜言蜜语，力图欺骗学生，掩盖他们叛徒和工贼的丑恶面目。法修总书记罗歇九日发表谈话，假惺惺地表示“支持”学生要求。法修作家阿拉贡九日还混到大学生的队伍里去，抢过扩音器，鼓动他如簧之舌，妄想为《人道报》一再刊登攻击学生正义斗争的文章的行为狡辩。可是群众越听越不对头，当场起哄。这个修正主义分子当场出丑，只好灰溜溜地溜走。
