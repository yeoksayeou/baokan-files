The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam has issued an appeal calling on the liberation army to launch continuous and fierce attacks to annihilate more American and puppet forces and decisively achieve a complete victory. It also calls on the people of South Vietnam to overthrow the Saigon puppet regime and establish a revolutionary government.

	Hanoi, May 9 (Xinhua) - According to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam has issued an appeal to all compatriots and soldiers in South Vietnam.

	The full text of the appeal, issued on May 6, 1968, is as follows:

	Dear Compatriots and Soldiers,

	Our simultaneous attacks have once again erupted in Saigon, Hue, Da Nang, and many other cities, in various county seats, and on battlefields from Quang Tri Province to the Ca Mau Peninsula, targeting American and puppet military headquarters, important institutions, military bases, airfields, and warehouses.

	Our military and civilian forces are delivering fierce blows to the American and puppet forces, achieving new and extremely glorious victories, and giving those who have committed countless crimes against our people the punishment they deserve.

	Inspired by these new victories, the entire South Vietnam is advancing with great vigor.

	With the high determination to fight to the end and win, the entire South Vietnam is shaking in the midst of the offensive and uprising.

	Dear Compatriots and Soldiers,

	Since our armed forces and people launched a comprehensive offensive and widespread uprising this spring, the final defeat of the American aggressors has become an inevitable outcome. However, the stubborn American aggressors have not abandoned their plans to invade our country.

	While resorting to various deceitful tricks, they continue to escalate their war of aggression, sending more troops and weapons, investing more money, frantically recruiting new soldiers, and launching a series of actions to massacre our people and destroy our villages and cities.

	However, the resolve of our entire military and civilian population is unshakable: as long as the Americans continue their aggression in South Vietnam, we will resolutely fight and defeat them.

	We will not accept slavery and the loss of our country again. Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom. The just struggle of the National Liberation Front is clear. The situation is developing in our favor.

	The American imperialist aggressors and their puppets, Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky, are being driven into an increasingly difficult situation. The complete failure of the American aggressors and the collapse and disintegration of the puppet army and government of Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky are inevitable.

	Dear Compatriots and Soldiers,

	At this moment when our entire people are engaged in a brave and glorious struggle, let us clearly understand the purpose of our revolution. Let us, with our iron will and boundless strength, bravely overcome all difficulties and hardships, and make any sacrifice. Let us launch continuous attacks and powerful uprisings to defeat the American aggressors, overthrow the puppet regime, win back all power for the people, and regain independence, sovereignty, and freedom, bringing happiness to all the people.

	Let the soldiers of the Liberation Army launch continuous and fierce attacks, annihilate as many American and puppet forces as possible, destroy as many of their war tools as possible, achieve new victories every day and every hour, frustrate the aggressive intentions of the American aggressors, crush the puppet army, and decisively achieve a complete victory.

	Let our compatriots in cities and towns and in rural areas still under enemy control take up arms and fight. Let them take up all the weapons they can get: guns, knives, axes. Let them cooperate closely with the Liberation Armed Forces, eliminate the brutal enemy agents, capture spies, overthrow the puppet government, and establish a revolutionary government. Let them organize themselves, support the Liberation Armed Forces, resolutely repel enemy counterattacks, protect the revolutionary government, protect the people's lives and property, and firmly maintain their control.

	Let our compatriots in the liberated areas carry out the slogan "Everything for the front! Everything to defeat the American aggressors!"

	Let the officers and soldiers of the Saigon puppet military and police, and the personnel of the Saigon puppet government, take the road to a decent life. Let them rise up, eliminate the brutal agents, serve the country, leave the enemy ranks, and stand with the people, bringing weapons to save the country and their families.

	Dear Compatriots and Soldiers,

	The unprecedented great and comprehensive victories we have achieved since we launched the comprehensive offensive and widespread uprising this spring have powerfully demonstrated the invincible strength and boundless wisdom of our armed forces and people.

	The battle between us and the enemy has entered the decisive stage. The American aggressors and traitors have resorted to all kinds of brutal means, looting, arson, raping women, and massacring. However, no reactionary force can withstand the unity and indomitable struggle of our military and civilian population.

	Let us overcome all difficulties and hardships and bravely advance. Complete victory will surely be ours.

    越南南方民族解放阵线中央发表呼吁书
    号召解放军连续猛攻歼灭更多美伪军坚决夺取彻底胜利
    并号召南方人民推翻西贡傀儡，建立革命政权
    新华社河内九日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会发表了致越南南方所有同胞和战士的呼吁书。
    一九六八年五月六日发出的这份呼吁书全文如下：
    亲爱的同胞们和战士们，
    我们的同时攻击的炮火再次在西贡、顺化、岘港和许多其他城市，在各个县城，在从广治省直到金瓯角的各战场上的美伪军事总部、重要机构、军事基地、机场和仓库里打响了。
    我们的军民正在给予美伪以猛烈的打击，建立了新的极其辉煌的功绩，并给予那些对我国人民犯下无数罪行的凶手以应有的惩罚。
    在这些新的胜利的鼓舞下，整个越南南方正在奋勇前进。
    在怀着决战决胜的高昂决心发动的攻势和奋起斗争的炮火中，整个越南南方都在震动。
    亲爱的同胞们和战士们，
    自从我们的武装力量和人民今年初春的全面进攻和广泛的奋起斗争开始以来，美国侵略者的最后失败已成为预定的结局。但是，顽固的美国侵略者并未放弃他们对我国的侵略计划。
    他们在施展各种狡诈伎俩的同时，继续加紧他们的侵略战争，调来更多的军队和武器，投入更多的金钱，疯狂地增募新兵，并发起了一系列的行动来屠杀我国人民，破坏我们的乡村和城市。
    但是，我们全体军民的决心是不可动摇的：只要美国继续在越南南方进行侵略，我们就坚决战斗和打败他们。
    我们决不愿再受奴役和再次失去我们的祖国。没有什么能比独立和自由更为宝贵的了。民族解放阵线的正义斗争的目的是十分清楚的。局势正在朝着有利于我们的方向发展。
    美帝国主义侵略者及其走狗阮文绍—阮高其集团正在被赶入越来越困难的处境。美国侵略者的彻底失败，阮文绍—阮高其傀儡军队和政权的垮台和瓦解是不可避免的。
    亲爱的同胞们和战士们，
    在我们全体人民进行英勇和光荣的斗争的这个时刻，让我们非常明确地理解我们革命的目的。让我们以我们钢铁般的决心和无穷的力量，勇敢地克服一切艰难困苦，不惜任何牺牲。让我们连续发动进攻和有力地奋起斗争，以打败美国侵略者，推翻傀儡政权，为人民赢回一切权力，夺回独立、主权和自由，给全体人民带来幸福。
    让解放军的官兵连续发动猛烈的进攻，尽可能多地消灭美伪军的有生力量，尽可能多地摧毁他们的战争手段，每日每时都取得新胜利，粉碎美国侵略者的侵略意图，击溃伪军，坚决取得彻底胜利。
    让我们在各城镇和仍然处于敌人控制下的农村地区的同胞们拿起武器，奋起斗争吧。让他们拿起他们能够拿到的一切武器：枪、刀、斧子。让他们同解放武装力量配合一致，消灭残暴的敌人代理人，围捕间谍，推翻傀儡政权，建立革命政权。让他们自己组织起来，援助解放武装力量，坚决击退敌人的反击，保卫革命政权，保护人民的生命财产，坚决维护他们的控制。
    让我们在解放区的同胞们执行“一切为了前线！一切为了打败美国侵略者！”的口号。
    让西贡伪军警的官兵和西贡伪政权的人员断然走上体面生活的道路。让他们起来斗争，消灭残暴的代理人，为祖国服务，脱离敌人队伍，带着武器站到人民一边，以拯救祖国和自己的家庭。
    亲爱的同胞们和战士们，
    我们自今年初春发动全面攻势和广泛奋起斗争以来所取得的空前伟大和全面的胜利，雄辩地证明了我们的武装力量和人民的不可战胜的力量和无比的智慧。
    我们同敌人之间的战斗已进入了决定性的阶段。美国侵略者和卖国贼采取了一切残酷的手段，掠夺、放火、强奸妇女和屠杀。但是，任何反动力量都无法抵挡我们军民的团结一致和不屈不挠的战斗。
    让我们克服一切艰难困苦，勇敢前进。彻底的胜利一定属于我们。
