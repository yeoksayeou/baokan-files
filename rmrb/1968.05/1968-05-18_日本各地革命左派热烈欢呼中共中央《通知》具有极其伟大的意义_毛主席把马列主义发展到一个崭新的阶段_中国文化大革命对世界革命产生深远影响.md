Japanese revolutionary leftists from various regions recently spoke to Chinese journalists, enthusiastically celebrating the second anniversary of the issuance of the "Notice" by the CPC Central Committee on May 16, 1966, under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao.

Iso Masamasa, a representative of the leftist faction of the Aichi Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, said that this "Notice," formulated under the personal leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, is a great document of Marxism-Leninism and has extremely great historical significance. He said that the great Chairman Mao comprehensively summarized the historical experience of the international proletarian dictatorship, revealed the laws and characteristics of class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat, systematically and comprehensively proposed the theory that class and class struggle still exist in socialist society, and creatively developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. Chairman Mao wisely solved the problem of continuing the revolution after the proletariat seizes power, strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, and preventing capitalist restoration, both theoretically and practically, thus bringing Marxism-Leninism to a new stage of Mao Zedong Thought.

Iso said that over the past two years, the brilliant victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat, making China a genuine base for world revolution. This victory has greatly inspired the Japanese people and people all over the world.

Iso said that the great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a political revolution under socialist conditions, in which the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the revolutionary masses led by it, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." This is Chairman Mao's most profound summary of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Iso said that the world revolution has now entered a new era, an era with the great thought of Mao Zedong as its banner. Chairman Mao is the great teacher of the revolutionary people of the world, and Chairman Mao has pointed out the direction of revolutionary struggle for the people of the whole world. The revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world are advancing to victory along the path indicated by Mao Zedong Thought.

Iso said: The imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries are frantically slandering the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China because the Khrushchev revisionists in China and their agents in various places have all been exposed, and their illusions of relying on these people to restore capitalism in China have completely collapsed.

Iso pointed out that the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Namba, which has betrayed the Japanese revolution, has also joined the chorus of anti-China propaganda. This fact shows that the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Namba is a henchman of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and Japanese reactionaries. The revolutionary people of Japan must unite the broad masses of the people under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely fight against U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, Japanese reactionaries, and the Namba group.

Kikuchi Kazuyoshi, a liaison officer of the leftist faction of the Chiba Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong, is an unprecedented great revolution in human history. It not only has a great impact on China's history but also has a profound influence on the international communist movement and world revolution.

Kikuchi said that Comrade Mao Zedong has developed Marxism-Leninism. He has not only solved a series of problems in contemporary proletarian revolution but also solved the problem of continuing the revolution and preventing capitalist restoration under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, both theoretically and practically. Mao Zedong Thought is a new milestone in the history of Marxism. He said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution guarantees that socialist China will never change color and become a base for world revolution. The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has shattered all the slanders of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries and has given great support and encouragement to the proletariat, oppressed peoples, and oppressed nations in Japan and the world.

Kikuchi expressed that the revolutionary leftists of Chiba Prefecture in Japan will deeply study the great thought of Mao Zedong, unite more closely under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and further strengthen the struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and Japanese monopoly capital.

Hosoda Toshio, a representative of the leftist faction of the Osaka Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has greatly consolidated the world revolutionary base—socialist China, solved the problem of preventing capitalist restoration and consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, made an incalculable contribution to the world revolution, and brought boundless confidence and hope to the revolutionary people of Japan and the world.

Hosoda said that the Japanese revolutionary leftists, inspired by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, have risen up to rebel against the Namba revisionist group.

Hosoda said that the great thought of Mao Zedong is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times. The revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world are all advancing to victory along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

Matsui Shiro, of the leftist faction of the Hyogo Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, said that the great leader Chairman Mao is the teacher of the revolutionary people of the world. Chairman Mao systematically and comprehensively proposed the theory that class contradictions and class struggle still exist in socialist society, solved the problem of continuing the revolution and preventing capitalist restoration under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, brought Marxism-Leninism to a new stage, and made extremely important and great contributions to the international communist movement. The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is not only a great victory for the Chinese people but also a great victory for the international proletariat and the people of the world.

Matsui said: With the victory and development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the anti-China and anti-Mao Zedong Thought counter-revolutionary nature of the Japanese Communist Party's Namba revisionist group has been further exposed.

He said that the great thought of Mao Zedong is the shining beacon of the international communist movement. Defending the great thought of Mao Zedong, defending the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and defending the great People's Republic of China is the sacred internationalist duty of the Japanese revolutionary leftists and the proletariat of the world.

Ishibe Keiko, a member of the leftist faction of the Aichi Prefectural Committee of the Democratic Youth League of Japan and a young female worker, said that the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, has greatly inspired the Japanese people and people all over the world. With the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, more and more Japanese revolutionary youth and people have raised their consciousness and seen through the counter-revolutionary true face of the Japanese Communist Party's Namba revisionist group.

Ishibe said: The Japanese revolution must rely on the great thought of Mao Zedong. Spreading the great thought of Mao Zedong to the Japanese people is our Japanese revolutionary youth's most glorious task. She said that the revolutionary youth of Japan, remembering the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," will further contribute their strength to the struggle for the liberation of the Japanese nation and the victory of the Japanese revolution.

She finally shouted passionately: "Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, Chairman Mao!"

    毛主席把马列主义发展到一个崭新的阶段
    中国文化大革命对世界革命产生深远影响
    新华社东京十七日电　日本各地革命左派最近向中国记者发表谈话，热烈欢呼毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》发表两周年。
    日本共产党爱知县委员会（左派）代表伊佐雅正说，在伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持下制定的这个《通知》，是马克思列宁主义的伟大文件，它具有极其伟大的历史意义。他说，伟大的毛主席全面地总结了国际无产阶级专政的历史经验，揭示了无产阶级专政下的阶级斗争的规律和特点，系统地、全面地提出了社会主义社会中仍然存在阶级和阶级斗争的理论，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说。毛主席英明地从理论上、实践上解决了无产阶级在夺取政权以后继续进行革命，加强无产阶级专政和防止资本主义复辟的问题，把马克思列宁主义发展到毛泽东思想的崭新阶段。
    伊佐说，两年来，中国的无产阶级文化大革命的光辉胜利，巩固了无产阶级专政，使中国成为真正的世界革命的根据地。这一胜利给日本人民和全世界人民以极大的鼓舞。
    伊佐说，伟大的领袖毛主席最近指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”这是毛主席对无产阶级文化大革命的最深刻的概括。
    伊佐说，现在世界革命已经进入了新时代，这就是以伟大的毛泽东思想为旗帜的时代。毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大导师，毛主席给全世界人民指出了革命斗争的方向。亚、非、拉和全世界的革命人民，正在沿着毛泽东思想指引的道路胜利前进。
    伊佐说：帝、修、反所以疯狂地诬蔑中国无产阶级文化大革命，是因为中国的赫鲁晓夫以及他在各地的代理人都被揪了出来，它们妄图依靠这些家伙在中国复辟资本主义的幻想已完全破产了。
    伊佐指出，出卖日本革命的日共宫本修正主义集团也出来参加反华的大合唱。这个事实说明，日共宫本修正主义集团是美帝、苏修和日本反动派的帮凶。日本革命人民要按照毛泽东思想团结广大人民，向美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义、日本反动派和宫本集团进行坚决的斗争。
    日本共产党千叶县委员会（左派）联络负责人菊地一茂说，毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，是人类历史上空前的伟大革命，不仅对中国的历史发生着伟大的作用，而且对国际共产主义运动及世界革命，正在产生着深远影响。
    菊地说，毛泽东同志发展了马克思列宁主义。他不仅解决了当代无产阶级革命的一系列问题，而且从理论上、实践上解决了在无产阶级专政的条件下进行革命，防止资本主义复辟的问题。毛泽东思想是马克思主义发展史上的新的里程碑。他说，无产阶级文化大革命保证了社会主义中国永不变色，成为世界革命根据地。中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，粉碎了帝、修、反的一切诽谤，给了日本和全世界无产阶级、被压迫人民及被压迫民族极大的支持和鼓舞。
    菊地表示，日本千叶县革命左派将深入地学习伟大的毛泽东思想，在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，进一步团结起来，加强反帝、反修、反日本垄断资本的斗争。
    日本共产党大阪府委员会（左派）代表保田敏男说，毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，大大地巩固了世界革命根据地——社会主义中国，解决了在无产阶级专政的条件下防止资本主义复辟，巩固和加强无产阶级专政的问题，为世界革命作出了不可估量的贡献，给日本和全世界革命人民带来了无限的信心和希望。
    保田说，日本革命左派，在中国无产阶级文化大革命的鼓舞下，纷纷起来造了宫本修正主义集团的反。
    保田说，伟大的毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。亚、非、拉以及全世界革命人民都在沿着毛主席指出的方向胜利前进。
    日本共产党兵库县委员会（左派）松井志郎说，伟大的领袖毛主席是世界革命人民的导师。毛主席系统地、全面地提出了社会主义社会中仍然存在着阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的理论，解决了无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命，防止资本主义复辟的问题，把马克思列宁主义发展到一个崭新的阶段，为国际共产主义运动做出了极其重要的伟大贡献。中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，不仅是中国人民的伟大胜利，而且是国际无产阶级和全世界人民的伟大胜利。
    松井说：随着中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利和发展，日共宫本修正主义集团的反华、反毛泽东思想的反革命本质更加暴露了。
    他说，伟大的毛泽东思想是国际共产主义运动光辉的指路明灯。捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想，捍卫中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利成果，捍卫伟大的中华人民共和国是日本革命左派和全世界无产阶级的神圣的国际主义义务。
    日本民主青年同盟爱知县委员会（左派）委员、青年女工矶部惠子说，由伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，给日本人民和全世界人民以极大的鼓舞。随着伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，越来越多的日本革命青年和人民，提高了觉悟，认清了日共宫本修正主义集团的反革命真面目。
    矶部说：日本革命必须依靠伟大的毛泽东思想。向日本人民传播伟大的毛泽东思想是我们日本革命青年的无比光荣的任务。她说，日本的革命青年，牢记伟大领袖毛主席“枪杆子里面出政权”的教导，将进一步为争取日本民族的解放和日本革命的胜利贡献出自己的力量。
    她最后满怀激情高呼：“全世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
