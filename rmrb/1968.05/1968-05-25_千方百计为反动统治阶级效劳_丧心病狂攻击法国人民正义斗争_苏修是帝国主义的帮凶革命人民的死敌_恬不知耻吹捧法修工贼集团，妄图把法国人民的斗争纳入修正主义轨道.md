Just as the mighty struggle of the French workers, students, and revolutionary people is powerfully striking at the reactionary rule of French monopoly capital, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, which has always acted as a special action squad to maintain the old capitalist order and as the number one accomplice of imperialism, eagerly jumped out to serve the French ruling class. Together with the French revisionist clique, they are sabotaging the just struggle of the French people, once again exposing the shameful traitorous face of the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique in betraying the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world.

Faced with the surging tide of the people's struggle, the French ruling clique bared its fangs, loudly proclaiming that the French "government cannot tolerate" actions aimed at "damaging the order of the Republic." They mobilized large numbers of police and gendarmes to carry out bloody suppression against workers and students participating in strikes and demonstrations. The bloody violence of the French ruling clique has aroused strong indignation from revolutionary people all over the world. However, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique blatantly stood on the side of the French ruling class, using the same tone as the French monopoly bourgeoisie to desperately distort right and wrong, slandering the just struggle of the French people as "riots," "rebellious actions," and "provocative demonstrations." They maliciously cursed the students who marched and demonstrated with red flags as merely "a small number of" "madmen," "hooligans," "irresponsible and detached from the masses, excited elements," and so on, cheering on the brutal suppression of revolutionary people by the French ruling class. The Soviet revisionist clique even absurdly claimed in their reports that the revolutionary actions of French workers and students provided "a possible pretext" for the French reactionaries to "sabotage movements," shamelessly shifting the blame for the French ruling class's suppression of revolutionary people onto the brave fighting French workers and students. This is truly beyond shame.

The Soviet revisionist clique is both angry and resentful about the invincible influence of Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China on the struggles of French workers and students. On May 6 and May 15, the *Izvestia* openly cursed the French revolutionary students as those "tending towards Beijing's thoughts" and "ultra-leftist" students, as a group "engaging in political adventurism," and so on. However, the Soviet revisionist clique's curses, like those of a witch, cannot in the slightest stop the widespread spread of the great Mao Zedong Thought, nor can they harm the just struggle of French revolutionary workers and students in the slightest.

To achieve the evil goal of sabotaging this great struggle of the French revolutionary people that has shocked the world, while maliciously slandering the revolutionary struggle of the French people, the Soviet revisionist clique spared no effort to whitewash the French revisionist clique, which is attempting to strangle this struggle. They tried to dress up these labor traitors, who are despised by the French revolutionary people, as the "leaders" of this movement. The Soviet revisionist press not only shamelessly propagated how many "important calls" the French revisionists had issued but also praised the French revisionists and their yellow unions' declarations to the French ruling class about their sabotage of the French people's revolutionary struggle as "flowers." The TASS news agency on May 21 boasted that a leader of the French revisionist yellow union openly kowtowed to the French ruling class, declaring that the French unions are "a stabilizing force for restoring the situation." This report by TASS not only exposed the labor traitor face of the French revisionists but also exposed the myth that the Soviet revisionists are spreading about the French revisionists being the "leaders" of this struggle as a complete lie.

In the face of the raging revolutionary struggle of the French people, the Soviet revisionist clique so eagerly attacked the French revolutionary people and praised the French revisionist clique. In essence, it was to collude with the French revisionist clique to drive the struggle of the French people onto the revisionist track of the Roger labor traitor clique, achieving the evil goal of cooperating with the French ruling class to extinguish this struggle. The Soviet revisionist press, in their reports, eagerly coordinated with the French revisionist clique to advocate that strikes should be conducted "peacefully," saying that French workers should be "calm" and show "high restraint" in their struggles, spreading counter-revolutionary economism and "peaceful transition" and other black goods. They maliciously propagated that the "basic demands" of the French working class were merely the abolition of the social insurance system reform decree and universal wage increases, etc. *Izvestia* also took the opportunity to peddle Khrushchev's "three-nothing" world's junk, saying in a commentary on May 22 that as long as "international tensions are eased," it can guarantee the improvement of the living standards of laboring people. The Soviet revisionist press also extensively advocated that workers should "take all necessary measures to protect (French monopoly capital's) means of production and prevent any accidents." This fully shows the treacherous nature of these labor traitors in selling out the fundamental interests of the working class and acting as the running dogs of the monopoly bourgeoisie.

The rapidly developing just struggle of French workers, students, and revolutionary masses has seriously shaken the foundation of the rule of French monopoly capital. To get out of their predicament, to put out the fire of this struggle of the French people, the French ruling class, while carrying out armed suppression, is also engaging in so-called "negotiations." To adapt to this need of the French ruling class, the Soviet revisionist mouthpiece TASS on May 20 relayed a statement from the political bureau of the French revisionists, which advocated that "conditions have now emerged that can satisfy the basic demands of laboring people and students." TASS on May 22 in its report also propagated that the French government is "willing to negotiate with the unions," and the French revisionists and other yellow unions also expressed their willingness to "participate in genuine negotiations." These facts show how eagerly the Soviet revisionist clique is serving the conspiracy of the French ruling class to extinguish the flames of the struggle of the French people.

The great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, pointed out, "Opportunists who try to block the tide, although they exist almost everywhere, cannot block the tide." No matter how the Soviet revisionist clique colludes with the French revisionist clique to try to block the revolutionary movement of the French people, in the face of the revolutionary torrent of the French people, they are like ants trying to stop a car, and in the end, they can only make their traitorous faces more exposed.

    千方百计为反动统治阶级效劳　丧心病狂攻击法国人民正义斗争
    苏修是帝国主义的帮凶革命人民的死敌
    恬不知耻吹捧法修工贼集团，妄图把法国人民的斗争纳入修正主义轨道
    新华社二十四日讯  正当声势浩大的法国工人、学生和革命人民的正义斗争，猛烈地冲击着法国垄断资本的反动统治的时候，一贯充当维护资本主义旧秩序别动队、帝国主义头号帮凶的苏修叛徒集团，迫不及待地跳出来为法国统治阶级效劳，伙同法修集团破坏法国人民的正义斗争，这又一次暴露出勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团叛卖世界人民革命斗争的可耻叛徒面目。
    法国统治集团面对汹涌澎湃的人民斗争的怒潮，凶相毕露，大肆叫嚷什么法国“政府不能容忍”旨在“损害共和国秩序的行动”，出动大批警察宪兵对参加罢工和示威的工人和学生进行血腥镇压。法国统治集团的这种血腥暴行，激起了全世界革命人民的强烈愤慨。而苏修叛徒集团却公然站在法国统治阶级一边，用同法国垄断资产阶级一样的腔调，竭力颠倒黑白地把法国人民的正义斗争污蔑为“骚乱”、“叛乱行动”、“挑衅性示威”，并且恶毒地咒骂高举红旗举行游行示威的学生只是“不大的一批”“疯子”、“流氓”、“不负责任、脱离群众的激动分子”等等，为法国统治阶级对革命人民的残暴镇压摇旗呐喊。苏修集团在报道中甚至胡说什么法国工人、学生的革命行动提供了“可能成为”法国反动派“破坏运动的借口”，丧心病狂地把法国统治集团镇压革命人民的罪责转嫁到英勇斗争的法国工人、学生身上，真是无耻之极。
    苏修集团对于战无不胜的毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命对法国工人和学生斗争的巨大影响，又恼又恨。五月六日和五月十五日的《消息报》公然谩骂法国革命学生是什么“倾向于北京思想的‘超左派’学生”，是“搞政治冒险”的集团，等等。但是，苏修集团这种象巫婆一样的咒骂，丝毫也阻止不了伟大的毛泽东思想的广泛传播，也丝毫损害不了法国革命工人和学生的正义斗争。
    为了达到破坏法国革命人民的这场震惊世界的伟大斗争的罪恶目的，苏修集团在恶毒地污蔑法国人民的革命斗争的同时，却又不遗余力地为妄图扼杀这场斗争的法修集团涂脂抹粉，企图把这些不齿于法国革命人民的工贼们打扮成是这场运动的“领导者”。苏修报刊不仅恬不知耻地大肆宣扬法修发出了多少“重要号召”，而且把法修及其黄色工会向法国统治阶级表白他们破坏法国人民革命斗争的丑行，也当作“香花”大加宣扬。塔斯社二十一日在报道中吹嘘法修黄色工会的一个头目公然向法国统治阶级奴颜婢膝地表白法国工会是“恢复局势的一种安定力量”，就是突出的一个例子。塔斯社的这项报道，不仅不打自招地暴露了法修的工贼面目，同时也暴露了苏修竭力散布的法修是这场斗争的“领导者”的神话，是彻头彻尾的谎言。
    苏修集团在法国人民革命斗争如火如荼地向前发展的情况下，如此卖力地攻击法国革命人民，吹捧法修集团，说穿了就是为了伙同法修集团把法国人民的斗争纳入罗歇工贼集团的修正主义邪轨，达到配合法国统治阶级扑灭这场斗争的罪恶目的。苏修报刊在报道中竭力配合法修集团鼓吹罢工要“和平”地进行，说什么法国工人在斗争时要“冷静”、要表现“高度的克制力”，散播反革命经济主义和“和平过渡”等等黑货。他们别有用心地宣传什么法国工人阶级的“基本要求”只是废除社会保险制度改革法令、普遍提高工资等等。《消息报》还乘机推销赫鲁晓夫的“三无世界”的破烂货，在五月二十二日的一篇评论中说什么，只要“缓和国际紧张局势”就可以保证劳动人民“提高生活水平”。苏修报刊还大肆鼓吹工人要“采取一切必要措施以保护（法国垄断资本的）生产资料和防止发生任何事故”。这充分表现了这伙工贼出卖工人阶级根本利益，甘当垄断资产阶级走狗的奴才相。
    迅猛发展的法国工人、学生和革命群众的正义斗争，严重地动摇了法国垄断资产阶级的统治基础。为了摆脱焦头烂额的困境，把法国人民的这场斗争扑灭下去，法国统治集团在武力镇压的同时，正在大搞什么“谈判”。为了适应法国统治集团的这一需要，苏修喉舌塔斯社五月二十日转发法修政治局的一项声明，声明鼓吹说，“现在已经出现了可以达到满足劳动人民和大学生基本要求的条件”。塔斯社五月二十二日在报道中又宣扬法国政府“准备同工会进行谈判”，而法修和其它的黄色工会也表示要“参加真正的谈判”。这些事实表明，苏修集团是多么起劲地为法国统治集团扑灭法国人民斗争烈火的阴谋效劳。
    无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席指出，“想要阻挡潮流的机会主义者虽然几乎到处都有，潮流总是阻挡不住的”。不管苏修集团伙同法修集团怎样企图阻挡法国人民的革命运动，但在法国人民的革命洪流面前，他们犹如螳臂挡车，到头来只能使他们的徒叛工贼嘴脸更加暴露无遗。
