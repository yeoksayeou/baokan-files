The spread of Mao Zedong Thought is driving the deepening of the world revolution. French workers and students, with their daring revolutionary spirit, continue to fiercely assault the decaying capitalist system.

The nationwide strike by French workers has entered its eighth day, with national transportation and economic activities still paralyzed.

Paris, May 26 (Xinhua) — The massive strike by French workers continues unabated. Ten million striking workers are steadfast in their struggle. Students across France, defying government bans, continue to hold demonstrations and marches, showing their fearlessness in the face of repression and their daring revolutionary spirit. While the French ruling class is intensifying its violent suppression of the workers' and students' struggles, it is also desperately using the French revisionist traitors and yellow union leaders to sabotage the revolutionary struggles of the workers and students.

The nationwide strike by French workers entered its eighth day on May 25. Striking workers continue to occupy numerous factories, mines, and enterprises, controlling key transportation hubs by land, sea, and air, causing French national transportation to come to a halt and economic activities to remain paralyzed. In Paris, the stronghold of French monopolistic capitalists, subways and buses remain out of service, shops, banks, and theaters are closed, and piles of garbage on the streets emit a foul odor. Prices continue to rise. According to reports, the price of potatoes has nearly doubled, and the prices of other items have "doubled or increased by fifty percent." Agence France-Presse exclaimed, "The capital (Paris) is in a state of paralysis."

The students and teachers of Paris fought bravely against the reactionary military police throughout the night of May 24, dealing a heavy blow to the French ruling class. On the morning of May 25, Paris was still filled with the smell of gunpowder. The streets were littered with fallen trees, overturned and burned cars, broken glass, and debris. According to reports, the students' brave resistance caused the police who had entered the university area to "face serious obstacles," forcing them to "inch forward" amidst the explosions of homemade grenades, mud, and flying stones and screws. Western news agencies exclaimed that "several districts of Paris presented a scene of civil war."

The desperate French ruling class, in an attempt to divide and weaken the united struggle of workers and students, is urgently using the French revisionist traitors and yellow union leaders to carry out sabotage. These traitors and scabs are bargaining with the French ruling class to sell out the interests of the working class. It is revealed that at the secret meeting of the three parties, including the French government, capitalists, and French revisionists and yellow union leaders, which began on May 25, they are plotting a new conspiracy to lure striking workers back to work with minor benefits such as wage increases. At the same time, the French ruling class viciously ordered the police to "dispel" all gatherings and marches, revealing their ferocious face of violent suppression.

However, workers and students in many French cities, defying the government's ban on demonstrations, held various forms of gatherings and marches on May 25. In Bordeaux, four thousand people participated in the demonstration. Demonstrators built barricades on the streets and fought bravely with the police. When the police attacked the students who had occupied the school building, the students called out from the building, expressing their determination: "Our morale is high, we are ready, we can hold on." Workers and students in Marseille occupied the Marseille Institute and held demonstrations and marches. In addition, demonstrations and gatherings of several thousand to more than ten thousand people were held in Grenoble, Brest, Bayonne, Saintes, and many other cities.

The just struggle of French workers and students continues to receive support from the people of other capitalist countries. While the people of Sweden and Italy held demonstrations and strikes, students in the eastern Canadian city of Vancouver held a demonstration and march in front of the French consulate on May 24. They carried signs reading "Support French students and workers!" and condemned the French authorities for brutally suppressing the French workers' and students' movements.

    毛泽东思想的广泛传播推动着世界革命深入发展
    法国工人学生以敢于斗争的革命气概继续猛烈冲击着腐朽没落的资本主义
    法国工人全国总罢工已进入第八天，全国交通运输中断，经济生活继续陷于瘫痪。
    新华社二十六日讯　巴黎消息：法国工人声势浩大的罢工仍在继续，一千万罢工工人坚持进行斗争，法国全国各地的学生不顾政府的禁令，仍不断举行示威游行，表现了不怕镇压，敢于斗争的革命气概。法国统治集团在加紧暴力镇压工人、学生斗争的同时，正在竭力利用法修叛徒集团和黄色工会头目来破坏工人、学生的革命斗争。
    法国工人的全国总罢工，二十五日已进入第八天。罢工工人继续占领着许多工厂、矿山、企业，控制了海、陆、空的交通枢纽，使法国全国交通运输中断，经济生活继续陷于瘫痪。在法国垄断资产阶级的统治中心巴黎，地下电车、公共汽车等继续停驶，商店、银行、剧场关闭，马路上的一堆堆垃圾发出恶臭，物价仍在不断上涨。据报道，每公斤土豆的价格几乎增长一倍半，其他物品的价格也“翻了一番，或者上涨百分之五十”。法新社惊呼“首都（巴黎）处于瘫痪状态”。
    巴黎的学生和教师二十四日晚上同反动军警进行的通宵达旦的英勇战斗，沉重地打击了法国统治集团。二十五日清晨，巴黎仍然硝烟弥漫。大街上到处可以看到被砍倒的大树，推翻和烧毁的汽车，碎石瓦砾，玻璃碎片等。据报道，学生的英勇奋战，使得侵入大学区的警察“受到严重的阻碍”，他们不得不“在土制手榴弹的爆炸中，泥泞中，在石块和螺钉横飞中”，“一寸一寸地”前进。西方通讯社惊呼，巴黎“好几个区呈现出一幅内战的景象”。
    焦头烂额的法国统治集团为分化、瓦解工人和学生的联合斗争，正在加紧利用法修叛徒集团和黄色工会头目进行破坏工作，而这些叛徒、工贼也正在为出卖工人阶级的利益同法国统治集团讨价还价。据透露，在二十五日开始的法国政府、资本家以及法修和黄色工会头目三方代表的秘密会议上，正在策划一项以增加工资等小恩小惠来诱使罢工工人复工的新阴谋。与此同时，法国统治集团恶狠狠地命令警察“驱散”所有的集会和游行，露出一副暴力镇压的凶相。
    但是，法国许多城市的工人、学生不顾法国政府不准示威的禁令，二十五日仍然举行了各种形式的集会和游行。在波尔多，有四千人参加了示威。示威者在街上筑起街垒，同警察进行了英勇的搏斗。当警察围攻占领了学校大楼的学生时，学生们从大楼里向外面打电话表示决心：“我们的士气很好，我们准备好了，我们可以坚持。”马赛的工人和学生占领了马赛理学院，并举行了示威游行。此外，在格勒诺布勒、布雷斯特、巴荣纳、圣特等许多城市也都举行了从数千人到一万多人不等的示威游行或集会。
    法国工人和学生的正义斗争继续得到其他资本主义国家人民的支持。在瑞典、意大利人民举行示威和罢工的同时，加拿大东部大城温哥华的学生，二十四日也到法国领事馆前面举行示威游行。他们打着“支持法国学生和工人！”的标语牌，谴责法国当局残酷镇压法国工人和学生运动。
