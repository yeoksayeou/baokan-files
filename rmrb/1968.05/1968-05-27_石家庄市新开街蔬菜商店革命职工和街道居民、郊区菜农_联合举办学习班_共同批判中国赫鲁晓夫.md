Revolutionary workers of the Xinkai Street Vegetable Store in Shijiazhuang City, along with residents of the street and suburban farmers, jointly held a study class to criticize China's Khrushchev. The store changed its capitalist management style, rural cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants further followed the state plan, and residents actively helped the store do its work.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province: The revolutionary committee of the Xinkai Street Vegetable Store in Shijiazhuang City developed the Mao Zedong Thought study class, which was attended by revolutionary workers, into a joint study class with residents of the street and suburban farmers. They carried out revolutionary criticism, focusing on the production, procurement, and sales of vegetables, to eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism spread by China's Khrushchev.

The Xinkai Street Vegetable Store has six retail outlets, responsible for supplying food to over 50,000 urban residents. It also organizes and arranges the production of vegetables for 17 production brigades of suburban people's communes through procurement and sales contracts. In October last year, the store established a revolutionary committee. Through revolutionary criticism, many revolutionary workers further realized that even in this small vegetable store, there is a serious struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. The store's capitalist roaders vigorously promoted China's Khrushchev's "profit-first" and "material incentives" black goods, fiercely opposing Chairman Mao's policy of "developing the economy and ensuring supply," attempting to drag socialist commerce towards capitalism. The revolutionary committee and the stationed Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, based on the workers' suggestions, jointly held a study class to criticize China's Khrushchev.

The study class jointly held by the store workers and residents and farmers has two organizational forms. One is a joint study class between store workers and street residents, and the other is a joint study class between store workers and rural cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants. The former study class is centered around the store's retail outlets, attracting residents to participate, using the time before morning business to study and criticize. This type of study class has been held for six sessions, with participants including 780 people from 18 residents' committees. The latter study class is organized by the store, sending cadres and workers to rotate with production teams and rural cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants to hold study classes. They live, eat, work, study, and fight together with the commune members after going to the countryside. This type of study class has been held for four sessions, with dozens of store workers and many cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants participating.

The store workers, residents, and farmers jointly carried out revolutionary criticism, focusing on the topic of vegetables, exposing and criticizing China's Khrushchev's attempt to restore capitalism from the various links of planting, procuring, and selling vegetables. The production team's poor and lower-middle peasants fiercely criticized the black goods of "self-reliance and contract responsibility," "four freedoms," and "work points first"; the store workers fiercely criticized the black goods of "profit-first" and "material incentives"; the workers, farmers, and residents jointly fiercely criticized the black "business philosophy" of "running factories and enterprises is for making money."

The workers, residents, and farmers participating in the study class, with class struggle as the key link, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, armed their minds with the theory of class struggle, carried out bitter-sweet remembrance activities, and raised their awareness of class struggle and two-line struggle.

The study class held by the Xinkai Street Vegetable Store thoroughly smashed China's Khrushchev's evil plot to restore capitalism, changed the past capitalist management style. In terms of supply methods, mobile vehicles and temporary supply points were introduced, and everything was considered for the masses. The service attitude of revolutionary workers has also greatly improved, and good deeds of helping residents solve living difficulties have continuously emerged. Rural cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants further correctly handled the relationship between the state and the collective, adjusting their vegetable planting plans according to the state plan. Street residents regarded the store as the people's store and actively helped store workers unload and sell vegetables, clean up, manage the market, and actively helped the store improve vegetable supply work.

    石家庄市新开街蔬菜商店革命职工和街道居民、郊区菜农
    联合举办学习班　共同批判中国赫鲁晓夫
    商店改变了资本主义经营作风，农村干部和贫下中农进一步按照国家计划办事，居民积极主动帮助商店做好工作
    据新华社石家庄电　河北省石家庄市新开街蔬菜商店革命委员会，把本单位革命职工参加的毛泽东思想学习班，发展成为和蔬菜商店有联系的街道居民、郊区菜农联合举办的学习班，开展革命大批判，从蔬菜的产、购、销三方面，清除中国赫鲁晓夫散布的反革命修正主义毒素。
    新开街蔬菜商店有六个门市部，担负着五万多城市居民的副食品供应任务，它还通过购销合同，组织安排郊区人民公社十七个生产大队的蔬菜生产。去年十月份，这个商店建立了革命委员会。通过开展革命大批判，许多革命职工进一步认识到，即使在他们这个不大的菜店里，同样存在着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的严重斗争。这个菜店的走资派极力推行中国赫鲁晓夫“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”等黑货，疯狂反对毛主席“发展经济，保障供给”的方针，妄图把社会主义商业拉向资本主义。商店革委会和驻军毛泽东思想宣传队根据职工们的建议，联合举办学习班，共同批判中国赫鲁晓夫。
    菜店职工和居民、菜农联合举办的毛泽东思想学习班，有两种组织形式。一种是菜店职工和街道居民的联合学习班，一种是菜店职工和郊区农村干部、贫下中农的联合学习班。前一种学习班以菜店门市部为中心，吸收街道居民参加，利用早晨营业前的时间进行学习和批判。这种学习班已经举办了六期，参加的居民包括十八个居民委员会的七百八十多人。后一种学习班由菜店选派干部、职工轮流到生产队和农村干部、贫下中农一起举办学习班，他们下乡后与社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同战斗。这种学习班已办了四期，参加的已有几十名菜店职工和许多干部、贫下中农。
    菜店职工和居民、菜农联合开展革命大批判，抓住蔬菜这个专题，从种菜、收购和卖菜等各个环节，全面系统地揭露和批判中国赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义的罪行。生产队的贫下中农狠批“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“工分挂帅”等黑货；菜店职工狠批“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”等黑货；职工、菜农、居民共同狠批“开工厂、办企业就是为了赚钱”的黑“生意经”。
    参加学习班的职工、居民、菜农，以阶级斗争为纲，大学毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，用阶级斗争的理论武装头脑，大搞忆苦思甜活动，提高阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    新开街蔬菜商店举办的这种学习班，彻底粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，改变了过去资本主义的经营作风。在供应方法上，出流动车、增设临时供应点，处处为群众打算。革命职工的服务态度也有了很大改进，帮助居民解决生活困难的好人好事不断出现。农村干部和贫下中农进一步正确对待国家和集体之间的关系，他们按照国家计划调整了自己的种菜计划。街道居民把菜店当成人民的菜店，也主动帮助菜店职工卸车卖菜，打扫卫生，管理菜场，积极帮助菜店搞好蔬菜的供应工作。
