The revolutionary struggles of the people in Europe and North America are excellent. Chen Changfeng, a standing committee member of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, stated that this year in April, the great leader Chairman Mao issued a statement supporting the anti-violence struggle of American blacks. Revolutionary struggles around the world are surging. The anti-imperialist tide is at an unprecedented high. Recently, in the heart of the capitalist world in Europe and North America, a powerful storm of mass struggles has risen. Especially in France, the unprecedented surge in student movements is merging with the wave of worker strikes sweeping across the entire country. Workers and students support each other and fight side by side. This is an important sign of the growing awakening of the people in Europe and North America, and a prominent manifestation of the increasing instability of the reactionary rule of the international monopoly bourgeoisie. It greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary people and strikes a heavy blow to the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. It is a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and various reactionary forces that are in dire straits both internally and externally. The surge in mass struggles in Europe and North America will further promote the flourishing development of the revolutionary movements of the people in capitalist countries and accelerate the comprehensive collapse of the imperialist system.

The new surge in mass movements in Europe and North America is inseparable from the tremendous influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which is shaking the world. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has accelerated the spread of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought around the world, greatly inspiring the fighting spirit of the people in Europe and North America. The revolutionary struggles of the people in Europe and North America are also a great inspiration to the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world.

The revolutionary struggles of the people in Europe and North America are excellent! It sounds the new call for the revolutionary people in this region who are oppressed and exploited to fight against the reactionary rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie, fully demonstrating their heroic spirit of defying tyranny and their tenacious fighting spirit.

The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur, sooner or later, and will certainly achieve victory." We firmly believe that the workers, peasants, students, revolutionary intellectuals, and the broad revolutionary people in Europe and North America will unite more closely, dare to struggle, and be good at struggling, and will certainly continue to achieve victories.

The 700 million Chinese people will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, and forever follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, charging into the fray and advancing bravely. Forward, workers and revolutionary people of France and the various countries in Europe and North America! The 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are determined to be your strong backing.

    欧洲、北美人民革命斗争好得很
    江西省革命委员会常委　陈昌奉
    今年四月，伟大领袖毛主席发表了支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。全世界革命斗争风起云涌。反帝怒潮空前高涨。最近，在欧洲、北美资本主义世界心脏地区，又兴起了一场强大的群众斗争的风暴。特别是在法国，空前高涨的学生运动，正在同席卷全法国的工人罢工浪潮汇合起来。工人和学生互相支持，并肩战斗。这是欧洲、北美人民日益觉醒的重要标志，是国际垄断资产阶级反动统治日益不稳定的突出表现。它大长了革命人民的志气，大灭了帝、修、反的威风。它对正在陷于内外交困的美帝、苏修及各国反动派是一个沉重的打击。欧洲、北美群众斗争的高涨，必将进一步促进资本主义国家人民革命运动的蓬勃发展，加速帝国主义制度的全面崩溃。
    欧洲、北美群众运动的新高涨，是和震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大影响分不开的。中国无产阶级文化大革命，加速了战无不胜的毛泽东思想在全世界的传播，极大地鼓舞了欧洲、北美人民的战斗意志。欧洲、北美人民的革命斗争，对于中国人民和全世界革命人民，也是一个巨大的鼓舞。
    欧洲、北美人民革命斗争好得很！它吹响了这个地区被剥削被压迫的革命人民反对垄断资产阶级反动统治的新号角，充分显示了他们不畏强暴的英雄气概和顽强的战斗精神。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”我们深信，欧洲、北美的工人、农民、学生、革命知识分子和广大革命的人民，更紧密地团结起来，敢于斗争，善于斗争，一定能够不断地取得胜利。
    七亿中国人民永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，永远沿着毛主席指引的方向，冲锋陷阵。奋勇前进吧，法国和欧洲、北美各国的工人阶级和革命人民！用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民誓作你们的坚强后盾。
