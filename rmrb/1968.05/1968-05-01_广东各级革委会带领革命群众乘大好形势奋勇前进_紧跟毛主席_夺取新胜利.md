The thought of Mao Zedong is being widely propagated more than ever before, the latest instructions of Chairman Mao are penetrating deeper into people's hearts, Mao Zedong thought study classes are becoming better and better, revolutionary great alliance and the three-in-one combination are further consolidated and developed, and the revolutionary great criticism is making a great noise. The industrial and agricultural production is thriving.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 30th: Under the brilliant guidance of the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary and production situation in urban and rural areas of Guangdong Province is better than ever. The revolutionary committees at all levels in the province are leading the broad revolutionary masses to continue their efforts and advance with the favorable situation. They are focusing on class struggle, carrying out the revolutionary great criticism in depth and over a long period of time, launching a fierce attack on the enemies of the proletariat, and further developing the revolutionary favorable situation.

Under the leadership of the Guangdong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the broad proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary people in the province have put the active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything. Many regions and counties have formed numerous Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, which have gone deep into factories, mines, rural areas, and other grassroots units. They have taken class struggle and the struggle between the two lines as the key, helping the revolutionary masses to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes extensively. Mao Zedong Thought has never been so widely propagated as it is now. The latest instructions of Chairman Mao are penetrating deeper into people's hearts. Mao Zedong Thought study classes are becoming more and more numerous and better and better. According to incomplete statistics, by mid-April, the province had held more than 180,000 study classes, with more than 16 million participants. Through the extensive holding of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the proletarian consciousness and the consciousness of the struggle between the two lines of the broad revolutionary masses have been greatly enhanced, and the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination have been further consolidated and developed under the principle of revolution. Now, all eight special districts in the province have established revolutionary committees. Of the 106 counties and cities in the province, 94 have established revolutionary committees.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the reactionary Kuomintang led by the broad revolutionary masses and the people, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Under the leadership of the provincial and various levels of revolutionary committees, the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary people in Guangdong are seriously studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, remembering Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," seizing the favorable situation, and launching a fierce attack on the enemies of the proletariat actively and without interruption. The broad workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres have heightened their revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, cooperated with the organs of dictatorship, and severely cracked down on the sabotage activities of the class enemies. They are determined to root out all traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks.

The broad revolutionary masses in Guangdong, in the struggle, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's recent wise instructions, have a deeper understanding of the fundamental nature and class content of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and at the same time, have a deeper understanding of the great significance of carrying out the revolutionary great criticism in depth and over a long period of time. The broad workers and poor and lower-middle peasants say that the traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and all counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the Party are still alive but not dead, and they are always watching for opportunities to rise again and restore capitalism every day. Our struggle with this small handful of class enemies is a life-and-death struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines, and a continuation of the long-term struggle with the reactionary Kuomintang. The broad revolutionary masses repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, combine them with the actual class struggle in their regions and units, focus on the revolutionary great criticism, resolutely oppose right opportunism, splitism, capitulationism, and conservatism, and strike back at the class enemies' attempts to reverse the verdict, further strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Now, the revolutionary great criticism led by the working class and the poor and lower-middle peasants is vigorously unfolding across the province. The broad revolutionary masses have turned workshops, construction sites, fields, classrooms, streets, alleys, and homes into battlefields for the revolutionary great criticism. They have raised the issue of whether or not to carry out the revolutionary great criticism to the level of whether or not to seize class struggle and whether or not to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and are determined to overthrow and expose thoroughly, from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, as well as their agents in Guangdong, and to eliminate all the poison of revisionism they have spread, allowing the invincible thought of Mao Zedong to occupy all positions.

In the revolutionary great criticism, the province has promoted the experience of the advanced unit in studying and applying the works of Chairman Mao—Huangshandong Brigade in Boluo County. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in this brigade have used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, closely combining the criticism of revisionism with the struggle against selfishness. They study one quotation from Chairman Mao, criticize one reactionary fallacy of Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Guangdong, fight one selfish desire, establish one revolutionary viewpoint, greatly promoting the revolutionization of thought, and becoming even more loyal to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. "What Chairman Mao advocates, we do; what Chairman Mao criticizes, we change; what Chairman Mao praises, we learn; what Chairman Mao opposes, we fight." This has become the highest principle of action for the broad revolutionary masses.

In the great struggle of leading the broad revolutionary masses to carry out the revolutionary great criticism in depth and over a long period of time, the revolutionary committees at all levels in Guangdong have played the role of a revolutionary command center. Many units' revolutionary committees, in order to better lead the revolutionary masses to fight against the class enemies, first conducted class education among the members of the revolutionary committees, recalling and comparing the bitter past, inviting old workers and old poor peasants to give reports comparing the old and new societies, telling the history of the factory, village, and family, greatly enhancing everyone's class consciousness and consciousness of the struggle between the two lines. Many units' revolutionary committees, except for leaving a very small number of comrades in the office to handle daily work, have most of their members go deep into the masses, actively learning and applying the works of Chairman Mao with the broad revolutionary masses, jointly carrying out the revolutionary great criticism, and launching a fierce attack on the class enemies. In the fierce class struggle, the revolutionary committees have further established the revolutionary authority of the proletariat, powerfully promoting the victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses in various places in Guangdong are seriously implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." Through focusing on class struggle and the revolutionary great criticism, they have promoted the current production and various work to develop vigorously. At present, industrial production in the province is booming, agricultural production is thriving, and market supplies are getting better and better. The revolutionary people of the province are continuing to advance towards victory along the course indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao.

　　广东各级革委会带领革命群众乘大好形势奋勇前进
　　紧跟毛主席　夺取新胜利
    毛泽东思想空前大普及，毛主席最新指示更加深入人心，毛泽东思想学习班越办越好，革命大联合和三结合进一步巩固和发展，革命大批判声势浩大，工农业生产欣欣向荣
    新华社广州三十日电  在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，广东省城乡革命和生产形势空前大好。全省各级革命委员会率领广大革命群众再接再厉，乘胜前进，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，向无产阶级的敌人发动猛烈进攻，进一步发展了革命的大好形势。
    在广东省革命委员会的领导下，全省广大无产阶级革命派和革命人民把活学活用毛泽东思想摆在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的地位。不少地区和县组成很多毛泽东思想宣传队，深入工矿、农村和其他基层单位，以阶级斗争和两条路线斗争为纲，帮助革命群众大办毛泽东思想学习班。毛泽东思想从来没有象现在这样空前大普及，毛主席的最新指示越来越深入人心。毛泽东思想学习班越办越多，越办越好。据不完全统计，到四月中旬止，全省已经办了十八万多期学习班，参加学习的达一千六百多万人次。通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，广大革命群众的无产阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟大大提高，在革命的原则下进一步巩固发展了革命大联合和革命三结合。现在，全省八个专区已经全部成立了革命委员会。全省一百零六个县、市，已有九十四个县、市成立了革命委员会。
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”广东无产阶级革命派和革命人民在省和各级革命委员会的领导下，认真学习毛主席的最新指示，牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，乘大好形势，主动地、不停顿地向无产阶级的敌人发动了猛烈进攻。广大工人、贫下中农、红卫兵小将和革命干部，百倍提高革命警惕，配合专政机关，狠狠打击了阶级敌人的破坏活动。他们决心把混进革命队伍的叛徒、特务，以及一切反革命分子，统统挖出来。
    广东省的广大革命群众，在斗争中活学活用毛主席最近的英明指示，对无产阶级文化大革命的根本性质和阶级内容有了更深刻的认识，同时也更加认识到深入持久地开展革命大批判的重大意义。广大工人和贫下中农说，混进党内的叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和一切反革命分子，他们人还在，心不死，每日每时都在窥测方向，妄图东山再起，复辟资本主义。我们和这一小撮阶级敌人的斗争，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线你死我活的大搏斗，是和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续。广大革命群众反复学习毛主席的最新指示，结合本地区、本单位阶级斗争的实际，狠抓革命大批判，坚决反对右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义、右倾保守主义，迎头痛击阶级敌人的翻案妖风，进一步加强了无产阶级专政。
    现在，以工人阶级和贫下中农为主力军的革命大批判，正在全省各地蓬勃展开。广大革命群众，把车间、工地、田头、课堂、街巷和家庭，都变成了革命大批判的战场。他们把搞不搞革命大批判，提到抓不抓阶级斗争、要不要巩固无产阶级专政的高度来认识，决心从政治上、思想上、理论上，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派及其在广东的代理人彻底批倒批臭，肃清他们散布的一切修正主义流毒，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。
    在革命大批判中，全省推广了活学活用毛主席著作先进单位——博罗县黄山洞大队的经验。这个大队的贫下中农和革命干部，以毛泽东思想为武器，把批修和斗私紧密结合起来。他们学习毛主席一条语录，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在广东代理人的一个反动谬论，猛斗一次私心，树立一个革命观点，大大促进了思想革命化，更加无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。“毛主席提倡的我们就做；毛主席批评的我们就改；毛主席表扬的我们就学；毛主席反对的我们就斗。”这已经成为广大革命群众行动的最高准则。
    在率领广大革命群众深入持久开展革命大批判的伟大斗争中，广东省各级革命委员会发挥了革命的战斗指挥部的作用。许多单位的革委会为了更好地率领革命群众向阶级敌人进行战斗，他们首先在革委会成员中进行回忆对比、忆苦思甜的阶级教育，请老工人、老贫农作新旧社会对比的报告，讲厂史、村史、家史，大大提高了大家的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。许多单位的革命委员会除留极少数同志在机关主持日常工作外，绝大部分成员都深入到群众中去，同广大革命群众一起活学活用毛主席著作，一起开展革命大批判，向阶级敌人展开猛烈进攻。在激烈的阶级斗争中，革命委员会进一步树立了无产阶级的革命权威，有力地推动了无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展。
    广东各地无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，认真贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，通过狠抓阶级斗争，狠抓革命大批判，推动了当前生产和各项工作的蓬勃发展。目前，全省工业生产蒸蒸日上，农业生产欣欣向荣，市场供应越来越好。全省革命人民正沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的航向继续胜利前进。
