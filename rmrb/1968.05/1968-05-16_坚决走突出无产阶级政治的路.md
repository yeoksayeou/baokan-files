Chairman Mao teaches us: "Politics is the commander, the soul." "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agent in Jiangxi, Fang Zhichun, vigorously advocate "material incentives" and promote "work points as the commander" and other revisionist goods in the management of people's communes, with the aim of erasing proletarian politics, suppressing the socialist enthusiasm of poor and lower-middle peasants, fostering capitalist spontaneous tendencies in the countryside, and realizing capitalist restoration. This fact shows that the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines is ubiquitous.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "If socialism does not occupy the countryside, capitalism will inevitably occupy it." The class enemy wants to lead us into the capitalist dead end, so we must firmly follow the socialist broad road. Recently, we have held several criticism meetings in our production team, severely criticizing "material incentives," "work points as the commander," and other revisionist goods, and decided to implement the Dazhai-style method of evaluating and recording work points that emphasizes proletarian politics.

This class struggle within the scope of management is very sharp and complex. We poor and lower-middle peasants firmly believe that the Dazhai-style method of evaluating and recording work points is good and should be implemented immediately. Unreformed landlords and rich peasants hate this method to death and secretly sabotage it, attempting to obstruct the implementation of this method. In the revolutionary criticism meetings, we severely criticized the revisionist goods promoted by the capitalist roaders, and at the same time pointed out that landlords and rich peasants want to sabotage our implementation of the Dazhai-style method of evaluating and recording work points, which is in collusion with the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, attempting to restore capitalism. The more we criticize, the more we hate the "revisionist" things; the more we criticize, the more confident we are in taking the socialist road. Everyone unanimously expressed that we must take the path of emphasizing proletarian politics, resolutely smash "material incentives," "work points as the commander," and other revisionist goods, and thoroughly shatter the class enemy's evil plot to restore capitalism.

Now, our team has implemented the advanced method of Dazhai-style evaluation and recording of work points. Although the time is short, good results have already been achieved. We will continue to grasp class struggle in all fields, carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, and fight the struggle between the two roads in the countryside to the end!

    坚决走突出无产阶级政治的路
    长冈大队塘背生产队队长　马会章
    毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”而中国赫鲁晓夫及其在江西的代理人方志纯之流，却拚命鼓吹“物质刺激”，在人民公社的经营管理工作中大力推销“工分挂帅”等修正主义黑货，其目的就是企图抹煞无产阶级政治，打击贫下中农的社会主义积极性，助长农村资本主义自发势力，实现资本主义复辟。这个事实说明，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，是无处不有的。
    毛主席教导我们：“对于农村的阵地，社会主义如果不去占领，资本主义就必然会去占领。”阶级敌人想把我们往资本主义的死胡同里引，我们就要坚定地沿着社会主义康庄大道走。最近，我们生产队里连续开了几次批判会，狠批“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”等修正主义黑货，决定推行突出无产阶级政治的大寨式的评工记分方法。
    这场经营管理范围内的阶级斗争，是十分尖锐复杂的。我们贫下中农坚定地认为大寨式评工记分方法就是好，要马上实行。没有改造好的地主、富农分子，对这个方法，恨得要死，暗地里进行破坏，妄图阻挠这个方法的推行。我们在革命大批判会上，狠批了走资派推行的修正主义黑货，同时也指出，地主、富农所以要破坏我们推行大寨式评工记分方法，就是和中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派上下呼应，妄图复辟资本主义。大家越批判，对“修”字号的东西越愤恨；越批判，走社会主义道路的信心越坚定。大家一致表示，要走突出无产阶级政治的路，坚决砸烂“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”等修正主义黑货，彻底粉碎阶级敌人妄图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。
    现在，我们队已经推行大寨式评工记分的先进方法了。虽然时间不长，但已收到很好的效果。我们还要坚持在一切领域中狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，把农村两条道路斗争进行到底！
