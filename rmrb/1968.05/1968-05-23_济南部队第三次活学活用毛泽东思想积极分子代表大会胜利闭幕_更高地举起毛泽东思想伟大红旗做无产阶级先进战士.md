The Third Conference of Active Learners and Appliers of Mao Zedong Thought in the Jinan Military Region concluded successfully. Over 2,000 representatives, coming from various combat positions, spent more than 30 days at the conference. With deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, they studied Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions and Vice Chairman Lin's important instructions. They extensively exchanged experiences in actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. The representatives unanimously expressed their determination to take Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to raise their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, to become advanced proletarian soldiers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and to better fulfill the great and glorious historical mission entrusted by the Party and the people to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The broad ranks of cadres and soldiers in the Jinan Military Region, in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great storm of the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, have taken "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key link. They have actively learned and applied the works of Chairman Mao, achieved new levels of learning and application, gained new experiences, made new achievements, and produced a large number of advanced collectives and individuals. The representatives at the conference believe that in the past year or so, the most distinctive feature and greatest achievement of the army's active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works has been to run a red line of infinite loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao through the broad ranks of cadres and soldiers in their combat, work, study, and life. The Party Committee of the 6037 Unit's study group on the works of Chairman Mao, in leading the "three supports, two militaries" work, would report to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin whenever they encountered major issues. After receiving instructions from higher authorities, they would study them thoroughly, deeply understand them, observe how higher authorities handle matters according to Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies, and think about how they should handle issues according to Chairman Mao's teachings. Through such observation and reflection, they continuously deepened their understanding of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, continuously corrected their course, and advanced courageously according to Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. The officers and soldiers of the "Iron First Battalion" of a certain unit wrote an epic of loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in rescuing a burning train loaded with highly toxic pesticides. The platoon leader Yang Ruzhong was in a coma for three days and three nights due to poisoning. When he woke up, his first words were: "Long live Chairman Mao forever!" His first request was to be helped to salute the portrait of Chairman Mao. After becoming the logistics director, the good quartermaster Sun Leyi used the "two rulers" of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, and the "two mirrors" of "extreme responsibility to work" and "extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people" in implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and carrying out Chairman Mao's latest instructions. He used them to examine his thoughts and measure his actions, thereby raising the struggle against selfishness and the establishment of public spirit to a new height in the struggle between the two lines. In the face of suppression by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, a certain unit in Shandong's Wulian County stood up and firmly supported the revolutionary leftists, bravely defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. These advanced deeds all reflect the deep proletarian feelings of the broad ranks of cadres and soldiers for the great leader Chairman Mao. The representatives deeply felt: "With a red sun in our hearts, no difficulty is insurmountable; with a red sun in our hearts, we will not be swayed by great winds and waves; with a red sun in our hearts, we dare to brave knife mountains and fire seas!"

At the conference, the representatives summarized and exchanged the main experiences of the cadres and soldiers of the Jinan Military Region in actively learning and applying the works of Chairman Mao over the past year. Their experiences are as follows: First, arming the mind with Chairman Mao's great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, being loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, is the fundamental awareness of an advanced proletarian soldier. The representatives believe: Deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism and strengthening education on the struggle between the two lines are the most effective methods to raise the awareness of the struggle between the two lines among the broad ranks of cadres and soldiers. Chairman Mao teaches: "One of our important tasks on the ideological front now is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." Vice Chairman Lin points out: "The army's work is complex and varied, but as long as we vigorously learn from and apply Chairman Mao's works and grasp the education on the struggle between the two lines, all problems can be solved." Education on the struggle between the two lines and revolutionary criticism are the most realistic and vivid class education, an important link in emphasizing proletarian politics, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, and carrying out thought reform. The representatives believe that by continuously summarizing experiences, we can combine revolutionary criticism with class struggle in society, combine it with the army's various tasks and activities, combine it with criticizing revisionism and fighting selfishness, so that cadres and soldiers can continuously keep up with the developing and changing new situation and continuously raise their awareness of the struggle between the two lines. Second, promoting a revolutionary learning style, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and taking all actions under the command of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, is the fundamental mark of being an advanced proletarian soldier. Third, with Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, going into the great storms of the masses' struggle, fighting selfishness, criticizing revisionism, reforming worldviews, and being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, is the fundamental way of being an advanced proletarian soldier. Fourth, building various levels of Party committees into leading cadres who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, is the fundamental guarantee for cultivating advanced proletarian soldiers.

During the conference, the representatives, through learning, discussions, and exchanges, expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in the future, to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, and to actively attack the enemies of the proletariat together with the broad revolutionary masses. They resolutely oppose right opportunism, right capitulationism, and right splitism, and smash the rightist reversal of verdicts. They will deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, focus on education on the struggle between the two lines, promote revolution, production, work, and preparedness for war. They will fiercely fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism. They will better fulfill the "three supports, two militaries" tasks. They emphasized that Chairman Mao's latest instructions must be learned and applied immediately; what is understood must be executed, and what is not understood must also be executed resolutely; understanding will deepen in the process of execution. They will achieve: "Act as soon as we hear Chairman Mao's voice, fight as soon as we encounter ideological obstacles, and catch up as soon as we find gaps."

The conference commended the heroic Fourth Platoon of a certain unit, the Party Committee of the 6037 Unit's study group on the works of Chairman Mao, the "Iron First Battalion" of a certain unit, and the logistics director Sun Leyi, deputy regiment commander Yang Yucai, deputy platoon leader Liu Shaotang, and militia member Yuan Guitian, among 24 advanced collectives and individuals, as models for actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the Jinan Military Region.

During the conference, the responsible comrades of the Jinan Military Region, Yang Dezhi, Wang Xiaoyu, and Yuan Shengping, made reports and important speeches to the conference.

At the closing of the conference, all the representatives, with hearts full of infinite love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, sent a telegram of salute to Chairman Mao.

    更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗做无产阶级先进战士
    两千多名代表学习了毛主席的一系列最新指示，广泛交流了在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想的经验。决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，更好地完成保卫无产阶级文化大革命和无产阶级专政的伟大光荣的历史使命
    新华社济南二十二日电　中国人民解放军济南部队第三次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会，最近胜利闭幕。来自各个战斗岗位上的两千多名代表，在历时三十多天的大会上，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席深厚的无产阶级感情，学习了毛主席的一系列最新指示和林副主席的重要指示，广泛交流了在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想的经验。代表们一致表示，决心以林副主席为光辉榜样，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，提高阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，做无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级先进战士，更好地完成党和人民赋予的保卫无产阶级文化大革命、保卫无产阶级专政的伟大光荣的历史使命。
    济南部队广大指战员在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的大风浪中，以“斗私，批修”为纲，活学活用毛泽东思想，学出了新水平，用出了新水平，取得了新经验，做出了新成就，涌现出大批先进集体和先进人物。到会代表认为，最近一年多来，部队活学活用毛主席著作的最大的特点、最大的收获，就是把对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心，作为一条红线贯穿在部队广大指战员的战斗、工作、学习和生活中。六○三七部队党委学习毛主席著作中心组，在领导“三支”“两军”工作中，每遇到重大问题，都及时地向以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部请示报告，接到上级的批示后，便认真研究，深刻领会，看上级是怎样按照毛泽东思想和党的方针政策办事的，想自己应当怎样按照毛主席的教导去处理问题。通过这样一看、一想，不断地加深对毛泽东思想和毛主席无产阶级革命路线的理解，不断端正前进的航向，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署奋勇前进。某部“钢铁第一营”的干部、战士，在抢救满载烈性农药的失火列车中，谱写下一曲忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的凯歌。这个营的班长杨汝中，中毒三天三夜昏迷不醒，当他苏醒过来时，第一句话是：“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”第一个要求是让别人扶着他向毛主席像致敬。好司务长孙乐义当了后勤处长以后，他把“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的“两把尺子”，“对工作的极端的负责任”和“对同志对人民的极端的热忱”这“两面镜子”，用在贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线中，用在落实毛主席的最新指示中，对照自己的思想，衡量自己的行动，从而把破私立公提到了两条路线斗争的新高度。在山东五莲县支左的某部队，在无产阶级革命派受到党内一小撮走资派压制的情况下，挺身而出，坚定不移地支持革命左派，勇敢地捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。这些先进事迹，都反映了广大干部战士无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚的无产阶级感情。代表们深有体会地说：“心中有个红太阳，天大的困难无阻挡；心中有个红太阳，大风大浪不转向；心中有个红太阳，刀山火海也敢闯！”
    会上，代表们总结和交流了济南部队指战员一年多来活学活用毛主席著作的主要经验。他们的经验是：第一，用毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的伟大理论武装头脑，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是无产阶级先进战士的根本觉悟。代表们认为：深入持久地开展革命大批判，加强两条路线斗争教育，是提高广大干部战士路线斗争觉悟的最有效的方法。毛主席教导说：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”林副主席指出：“部队工作千头万绪，只要大力活学活用毛主席著作，抓好两条路线教育，一切问题就可以迎刃而解。”两条路线斗争教育，革命大批判，是最现实、最生动的阶级教育，是突出无产阶级政治、活学活用毛主席著作、搞好思想革命化的重要环节。代表们认为，要通过不断总结经验，把革命大批判和社会上的阶级斗争结合起来，和部队的各项工作、各种活动结合起来，把批修和斗私结合起来，使干部战士不断紧跟发展变化的新形势，不断提高路线斗争觉悟。第二，大兴革命学风，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，一切行动听伟大统帅毛主席的指挥，是做无产阶级先进战士的根本标志。第三，用毛泽东思想挂帅，到群众斗争的大风大浪中去，斗私批修，改造世界观，做到无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是做无产阶级先进战士的根本途径。第四，把各级党委建设成为无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的领导班子，是培养无产阶级先进战士的根本保证。
    会上，代表们通过学习、座谈、讨论，纷纷表示：今后要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，与广大革命群众一起，主动地向无产阶级的敌人猛烈进攻。坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾投降主义、右倾分裂主义，粉碎右倾翻案风。深入开展革命大批判，大抓两条路线斗争教育。抓革命、促生产、促工作、促战备。狠斗“私”字，猛批修正主义。更好地完成“三支”“两军”任务。他们强调，对毛主席的最新指示，必须学了就用，立竿见影；理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要坚决执行，在执行中加深理解；做到：“一听到毛主席的声音就干，一遇到思想阻力就斗，一发现差距就赶。”
    大会树立了某部英雄四排、六○三七部队党委学习毛主席著作中心组、某部“钢铁第一营”和后勤处长孙乐义、副团长杨育才、副班长刘绍堂、民兵苑桂田等二十四个先进集体和先进人物，为济南部队活学活用毛泽东思想标兵。
    会议期间，济南部队负责人杨得志、王效禹、袁升平分别向大会作了报告和重要讲话。
    大会闭幕时，全体代表怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的心情，向毛主席发了致敬电。
