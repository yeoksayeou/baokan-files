Workers, students, women, and members of some progressive organizations in North Kyushu, Japan, have recently held successive meetings and demonstrations to oppose the establishment of an American ammunition depot. Workers also went on strike to refuse loading and transporting ammunition for the U.S. military.

According to reports, 5,000 workers, students, and members of progressive organizations in Kitakyushu City held meetings on May 21 to protest against U.S. imperialism's escalation of the Vietnam War and the establishment of an ammunition depot in Japan. After the meetings, the participants marched to the front of the U.S. military's Yamada ammunition depot to demonstrate.

Members of the Fukoka Prefecture branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) carried red flags with slogans such as "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long Live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!" and "Long Live the Fighting Friendship Between the Peoples of China and Japan!" to support the dock workers' just struggle in Mooji Port. This group joined the workers' ranks. They chanted slogans such as "Oppose loading ammunition!" "Demand the dismantling of the Yamada ammunition depot!" "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Japanese revisionism!" during the struggle.

Workers and patriotic youth students in Kitakyushu City and Fukuoka City held protest meetings and demonstrations on May 19. The demonstrators bravely fought against Japanese police who came to suppress them. The unyielding demonstrators marched all the way to the Mooji dock, shouting angrily at the American bandit ships, "Oppose transporting ammunition!" and other slogans, forcing the U.S. military not to unload ammunition from the ships that day.

On May 18, 300 students demonstrated in Kitakyushu City, chanting slogans such as "Dismantle the Yamada ammunition depot!" "We firmly support the dock workers' struggle!" and others.

Two thousand dock workers in Mooji Port went on strike on May 16, refusing to unload ammunition for American ships. On the same day, patriotic youth students in Kitakyushu City held a sit-in demonstration in front of the Yamada ammunition depot. The Japanese reactionary authorities dispatched armed police to suppress them, but the patriotic youth students, undaunted, sang the "Internationale" and bravely fought against the police.

	Japanese demonstrators in Yamaguchi Prefecture carried portraits of the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and banners reading "Firmly support the struggle of American blacks against violence" and other slogans, chanting slogans as they marched through the streets.
