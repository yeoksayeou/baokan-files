The revolutionary cadres and broad masses of workers at Huainan Coal Mine have been firmly grasping class struggle, using revolution to lead production, and ceaselessly pushing forward both revolution and production. Currently, the Mining Bureau and its sixteen affiliated mines and factories have all established revolutionary committees. Since May, coal production has significantly increased, with high production records emerging one after another. The average daily coal production in the first ten days of May was 7.7% higher than the same period in April. The average daily coal production in the middle ten days of May was nearly double that of the first ten days. The entire mine set a new high daily production record on May 18, the highest in recent years.

After the revolutionary committees of the Huainan Mining Bureau and its affiliated mines and factories were established, they immediately led the broad revolutionary masses of workers to launch a series of increasingly fierce attacks against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Huainan Coal Mine, as well as all class enemies. They held high the banner of revolutionary criticism, eliminating interference from the right or ultra-left, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle, and carrying out extensive, in-depth, and sustained revolutionary criticism. Workers in Datong Mine, Li Yi Mine, and Xie San Mine actively carried out revolutionary criticism in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, before-shift meetings, and at the mine entrances. Using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, they linked their bitter lives in the old society to criticize the reactionary revisionist goods of the Chinese Khrushchev, such as the "exploitation is beneficial" and "class struggle is extinguished" theories. They fiercely criticized and fought against the small handful of capitalist roaders within the mine and other class enemies, continuously raising their class consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines. Their revolutionary enthusiasm grew stronger, and production rapidly developed.

Recently, our great leader Chairman Mao profoundly pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses led by it and the reactionary Kuomintang. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The broad revolutionary masses of workers at Huainan Coal Mine repeatedly studied and deeply understood Chairman Mao's brilliant directive. In seizing the revolution and promoting production, they closely watched the new trends in class struggle, firmly grasped the initiative in the struggle, and timely exposed the class enemies' attempts to incite anarchist tendencies and spread counter-revolutionary economism, aiming to disrupt production and undermine the newly established revolutionary committees. They exposed a small handful of unrepentant capitalist roaders and traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries hiding within the revolutionary ranks. They implemented the dictatorship of the masses with the participation of the broad masses, greatly boosting the morale of the proletariat and ensuring the implementation of Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production."

The "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao point out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country." The broad revolutionary masses of workers at Huainan Coal Mine closely followed the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, under the leadership of the revolutionary committees, firmly grasped class struggle, used revolution to lead production, and launched a fierce battle to increase coal production. The broad revolutionary masses regarded producing more and better coal as an important manifestation of their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao and to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. The miners of the water-powered coal extraction team in Xie San Mine actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, carried out the revolution above ground and promoted production below ground. Since the beginning of this year, their production tasks have been completed relatively well. On May 14, the workers of Xinzhuangzi Mine produced over 6,100 tons of coal in one day, completing 136% of the plan. On May 18, they once again surged forward, creating a new record of 7,647 tons of coal produced in one day, exceeding the state plan by 70%. Now, all ten mines in the bureau have maintained stable production after exceeding the high production plan.

In the battle to increase coal production, some responsible comrades from the Huainan Municipal Revolutionary Committee, the Mining Bureau Revolutionary Committee, and the stationed People's Liberation Army soldiers went down into the mines to work shifts with the workers. Many office workers from the Mining Bureau also went to the production front lines and fought side by side with the workers. All revolutionary workers, cadres, and family members in the entire mine actively contributed to increasing coal production.

Under the guidance of the latest directives from the great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary cadres and broad masses of workers at Datong Coal Mine have been actively launching sustained attacks against the enemies of the proletariat, with both revolution and production achieving unprecedentedly good results. Since entering May, coal production has significantly increased. From May 1 to May 24, the average daily production was 36.6% higher than the average daily production in April, exceeding the state plan. The great news that our great leader Chairman Mao received the revolutionary worker representatives and military control commission officials attending the coal mine revolution and production conference on May 20 spread to this mine, boosting the enthusiasm of the revolutionary workers and further increasing production. Currently, they are advancing victoriously to achieve even better results to report to the great leader Chairman Mao.

At the crucial moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the class struggle, two-line struggle, and two-line struggle between the two classes and two roads in Datong Coal Mine have become more complex and profound. The great leader Chairman Mao profoundly pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses led by it and the reactionary Kuomintang. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's directive deeply expounded the great significance and class content of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Members of various levels of revolutionary committees immediately led the broad revolutionary masses to conduct extensive study and discussion in conjunction with the class struggle in their units. Various levels of revolutionary committees held mobilization meetings to launch sustained attacks against class enemies. From the mine entrances to the teams, from dormitories to streets, everywhere became a battlefield for revolutionary criticism, making class enemies like rats crossing the street with nowhere to hide. After achieving revolutionary great unity under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest directives, some people in Hongwu Mine tried to establish separate factions and split the ranks of the working class. After exposure by the masses, it turned out to be a Kuomintang reactionary officer hiding among the masses, secretly inciting trouble and attempting to split the revolutionary masses and overthrow the newly established revolutionary committee. After the proletarian revolutionary cadres exposed the class enemies hiding in the sewers and causing trouble, the revolutionary great unity was quickly consolidated and developed. The entire mine presented a new situation of the working class uniting as one to achieve double victories in revolution and production, with coal production significantly increasing.

The proletarian revolutionary cadres of Datong Coal Mine placed the study of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront while launching sustained attacks against class enemies. They studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle, making the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought even more vigorous. Now, Mao Zedong Thought study classes are becoming more and more numerous and better organized, with over 8,000 study classes developed throughout the mine area, involving more than 150,000 participants, from miners to family members. They used Mao Zedong Thought study classes as both a battlefield for criticizing and repenting of private thoughts and a battlefield for criticizing revisionism. In the revolutionary criticism, they fiercely criticized the revisionist goods promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, such as "money as the commander" and "material incentives," while also criticizing and fighting against the "private" thoughts in their own minds. Workers, through criticizing and repenting of private thoughts, deeply felt that being confused by the "private" thoughts would make them vulnerable to being used by class enemies; being guided by the "public" thoughts would make them firmly stand on the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. Through sustained revolutionary criticism, the broad masses' class struggle consciousness and line struggle consciousness were greatly enhanced. They worked eight hours underground and immediately joined the revolutionary criticism battle after coming up, thus achieving new successes in both revolution and production.

    抓革命促生产以优异的成绩向毛主席报喜
    淮南煤矿用革命统帅生产，掀起轰轰烈烈夺煤大战，高产纪录联翩出现
    大同煤矿革命职工主动向阶级敌人持续进攻，革命和生产形势空前大好
    新华社合肥二十六日电　淮南煤矿无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，狠抓阶级斗争，以革命统帅生产，不停顿地把革命和生产推向前进。目前，矿务局以及所属十六个厂、矿等单位，全部成立了革命委员会。五月份以来，煤炭生产大幅度上升，高产纪录一个接着一个。五月上旬平均日产煤量比四月同期提高百分之七点七，五月中旬平均日产煤量又比上旬提高将近一倍，全矿在五月十八日创造了近几年来的最高日产纪录。
    淮南矿务局和所属厂矿的革命委员会诞生后，立即率领广大革命职工，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在淮南煤矿的代理人和一切阶级敌人，发动了一次比一次更为猛烈的进攻。他们高举革命的批判大旗，排除来自右的或极“左”方面的干扰，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，把革命大批判广泛、深入、持久地开展下去。大通矿、李一矿、谢三矿的革命职工在毛泽东思想学习班里，在班前会上，在井口，都积极开展革命大批判。工人们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，联系自己在旧社会的苦难生活，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”、“阶级斗争熄灭”论等反革命修正主义黑货，狠斗狠批矿内一小撮走资派等阶级敌人，阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争的觉悟不断提高，革命干劲越来越足，生产迅速发展。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”淮南煤矿广大革命职工反复学习、深刻领会毛主席的这一英明指示，在抓革命促生产中密切注视阶级斗争的新动向，牢牢掌握斗争的主动权，及时揭穿了阶级敌人煽动无政府主义思潮，刮起反革命经济主义妖风，妄图破坏生产，动摇新生的革命委员会的罪恶阴谋。他们揪出了一小撮顽固不化的走资派和隐藏在革命队伍内部的叛徒、特务和反革命分子，对他们实行广大人民群众参加的群众专政，大长了无产阶级的志气，保证了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的贯彻执行。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”淮南煤矿广大革命职工紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，在革命委员会领导下狠抓阶级斗争，以革命统帅生产，掀起了一场轰轰烈烈的夺煤大战。广大革命职工把多产煤、产好煤，看成是无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的重要表现。谢三矿水力采煤队的矿工们活学活用毛主席著作，井上闹革命，下井促生产，今年以来，生产任务一直完成得比较好。新庄孜矿工人在五月十四日这一天产煤六千一百多吨，完成计划百分之一百三十六，十八日又一鼓作气，创造了日产七千六百四十七吨的新纪录，超过国家计划百分之七十。现在，全局十个矿都在超额完成高产计划以后，保持了稳产。
    在夺煤大战中，淮南市革委会、矿务局革委会的部分负责同志以及驻矿解放军指战员，下井和工人一起顶班劳动。矿务局的许多机关工作人员也深入生产第一线，和工人并肩战斗。全矿革命职工、革命干部和革命家属都积极地为增产煤炭贡献力量。
    新华社太原二十六日电　在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的指引下，大同煤矿的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，主动地向无产阶级的敌人发起持续的进攻，革命和生产形势空前大好。进入五月份，煤炭生产大幅度上升，五月一日至二十四日，平均日产量比四月份的平均日产量增长百分之三十六点六，超额完成国家计划指标。我们伟大领袖毛主席五月二十日接见了出席煤矿抓革命、促生产会议的革命职工代表和军管会负责同志的特大喜讯传到这个矿以后，革命职工干劲倍增，生产更是大幅度上升。目前，他们正乘胜前进，夺取更优异的成绩向伟大领袖毛主席报喜。
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，大同煤矿的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争更加复杂、更加深刻。伟大领袖毛主席深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席的这一指示，深刻地阐明了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义和阶级内容，各级革命委员会成员立即带领广大革命群众，结合本单位的阶级斗争实际，展开了大学习、大讨论。各级革命委员会分别召开了向阶级敌人发起主动进攻的誓师大会，从井口到队组，从宿舍到街头，处处是革命大批判的战场，使阶级敌人成为过街老鼠，无处躲藏。红五矿革命群众在毛主席最新指示指引下实现革命的大联合以后，有些人却另立山头，分裂工人阶级队伍。经过群众揭发，原来是个混在群众队伍里的国民党反动军官，在背地里煽风点火，妄图分裂革命群众，颠覆新生的革命委员会。无产阶级革命派把钻在阴沟里进行捣乱破坏的阶级敌人揭露出来后，革命的大联合迅速地得到巩固和发展，全矿出现了工人阶级团结一致，夺取革命生产双胜利的新局面，煤炭生产大幅度上升。
    大同煤矿的无产阶级革命派在向阶级敌人展开持续的进攻时，把学习毛主席著作放在首位。他们在斗争中学，在斗争中用，使活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动更加高涨。现在，毛泽东思想学习班越办越多，越办越好，全矿区的毛泽东思想学习班发展到八千多个，参加学习的人数达十五万多人，从矿工到家属都参加了学习。他们把毛泽东思想学习班既当成斗私的阵地，又作为批修的战场，在革命大批判中，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的“金钱挂帅”、“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货，同时结合批修狠斗自己头脑中的“私”字。工人们通过斗私批修，深有体会地说：“私”字迷了窍，就会被阶级敌人利用；“公”字当了先，就能坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上。通过持久的革命大批判，广大群众阶级斗争觉悟和路线斗争觉悟大大提高，他们下井坚持八小时劳动，上井立即投入革命大批判的战斗，因此在革命、生产中都取得了新成就。
