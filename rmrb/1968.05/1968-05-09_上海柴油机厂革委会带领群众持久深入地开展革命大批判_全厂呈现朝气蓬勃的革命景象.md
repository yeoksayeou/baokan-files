The Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory leads the masses in a persistent and in-depth revolutionary criticism, presenting a vibrant revolutionary scene throughout the factory.

Since the establishment of the factory's Revolutionary Committee, production has increased month by month, exceeding the state plan every month. In April, the production of diesel engines surpassed the highest level of the same period in 1966.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 8th — The Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory has led all revolutionary workers in the factory to focus on the revolution, promoting continuous production growth. Since the establishment of the factory's Revolutionary Committee in September last year, production has increased month by month, exceeding the state plan every month. This year, the production plan for April was completed four days ahead of schedule before May Day, with diesel engine production significantly exceeding the highest level of the same period in 1966, the year with the highest production. In the past few months, the factory has successfully developed new diesel engine products with high horsepower and advanced technology, and has also successfully researched many new processes and technologies.

After the proletarian revolutionary faction took power in Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, they followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle." Under the leadership of the factory's Revolutionary Committee, they continued to focus on the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, launching continuous and proactive attacks on the enemies of the proletariat. They persistently and deeply carried out revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticizing China's Khrushchev and his agents politically, ideologically, and theoretically, creating a vibrant revolutionary scene throughout the factory.

Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory was a fierce battleground of class struggle and line struggle during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This factory, with over six thousand workers, was originally a bureaucratic capitalist enterprise controlled by the four major families of the Kuomintang, selling foreign agricultural machinery. After liberation, the factory's power was seized by a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party. They colluded with the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries left in the factory, as well as a small number of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries, frenziedly promoting China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Therefore, class struggle in the factory has always been intense. In the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary masses in this factory, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launched a fierce attack on China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai, as well as a small clique of capitalist roaders in the factory. In the struggle, they established a strong revolutionary mass organization—the "Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory East Is Red Headquarters of the Workers' General Command." After the "January Revolution," a small clique of class enemies and various ghosts and snakes in Shanghai, unwilling to face their own doom, colluded with each other to launch a ferocious counterattack, attempting to overthrow the newly born Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee. The proletarian revolutionary faction in this factory, with boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao, used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, fighting shoulder to shoulder with Shanghai's proletarian revolutionary faction, foiling the class enemies' evil plots, firmly defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and safeguarding the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee. The Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory was born victorious in this fierce class struggle.

At the time of the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, the proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary masses in this factory solemnly pledged to Chairman Mao: With Chairman Mao backing us, we vow to make Chairman Mao proud; we will forever follow Chairman Mao and revolutionize to the end without turning back! Under the leadership and guidance of the factory's Revolutionary Committee, the revolutionary masses, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, launched a magnificent revolutionary criticism movement. As the revolutionary criticism deepened, the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the factory reached a new height. The factory held over two hundred sessions of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, producing over five hundred active participants in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and emerging as famous advanced models in the city, such as Guo Sanzhen, Jiang Xukuan, and Jie Fuxi. The class struggle and line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary masses in the factory were further heightened. They united as one, launching wave after wave of fierce attacks on the stubborn capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and class enemies hiding in various corners of the factory, achieving one victory after another, and ensuring the continuous growth of production.

　　上海柴油机厂革委会带领群众持久深入地开展革命大批判
　　全厂呈现朝气蓬勃的革命景象
    自厂革委会成立以来，产量逐月提高，月月超额完成国家计划，四月份柴油机产量超过年产量最高的一九六六年同期水平
    新华社上海八日电　上海柴油机厂革命委员会带领全厂革命职工狠抓革命，促进了生产的持续上升。从去年九月成立厂革命委员会以来，全厂产量逐月提高，月月超额完成国家计划；今年四月份的生产计划，又在“五一”节前提前四天完成，柴油机产量大大超过了年产量最高的一九六六年同期水平。这几个月来，这个厂还试制成功了马力大、水平高的柴油机新产品，并且研究成功了许多项新工艺和新技术。
    上海柴油机厂的无产阶级革命派掌权以后，遵循伟大领袖毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，在厂革命委员会的带领下，继续狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，连续、主动地向无产阶级的敌人展开猛烈进攻，持久、深入地开展革命的大批判，从政治上、思想上、理论上狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，使整个工厂出现一派朝气蓬勃的革命景象。
    上海柴油机厂在无产阶级文化大革命中，是上海阶级斗争和路线斗争异常剧烈的一个战场。这个拥有六千多职工的大厂，它的前身是国民党反动派四大家族直接控制的一个推销外国农业机械的官僚资本主义企业；解放后，工厂大权又被党内一小撮走资派所篡夺，他们同国民党反动派留在厂内的残渣余孽以及一小撮叛徒、特务和反革命分子相互勾结，疯狂地推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，因此，厂内阶级斗争历来十分激烈。在无产阶级文化大革命初期，这个厂的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人和厂内一小撮走资派展开了勇猛的进攻。在斗争中，他们建立了坚强的革命群众组织——“工总司上海柴油机厂东方红总部”。“一月革命”以后，这个厂里的一小撮阶级敌人和上海形形色色的牛鬼蛇神不甘心自己灭亡，他们互相勾结起来，进行猖狂反扑，妄图颠覆新诞生的上海市革命委员会。这个厂的无产阶级革命派怀着对毛主席的无限热爱、无限忠诚的无产阶级感情，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，和上海的无产阶级革命派并肩战斗，粉碎了阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋，坚决捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，保卫了上海市革命委员会。上海柴油机厂革命委员会，就在这场剧烈的阶级搏斗中胜利诞生了。
    在成立革命委员会时，这个厂的无产阶级革命派和革命群众向毛主席庄严宣誓：毛主席为我们撑腰，我们誓为毛主席争气；要永远紧跟毛主席，革命到底不回头！在厂革委会的领导和带动下，革命群众以毛泽东思想为武器，开展了轰轰烈烈的革命大批判。随着革命大批判的不断深入发展，全厂活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动发展到了一个新的高度。全厂办起了两百多期各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，涌现了五百多名活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子，出现了郭三珍、姜绪宽、解福喜等活学活用毛泽东思想的全市著名的先进标兵。全厂革命群众的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟得到了进一步的提高。他们团结一致，对厂里顽固不化的走资派、叛徒、特务以及隐藏在各个角落里的阶级敌人，发起了一次又一次猛烈的进攻，夺取了一个又一个的胜利，保证了生产的持续上升。
