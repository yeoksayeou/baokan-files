The workers of the revolutionary coal mining team 109 at Fushun Hongqi Mine have a good habit: every day after work, they always clean out the floating coal on the chute, the working face, and the conveyor belt, and the coal blocks filled in the pits and hollows, before they go up the shaft.

There is a story behind this habit.

One day, after work, Lü Hongjin found that there were large and small pits on the working face, all filled with coal blocks. Lü Hongjin remembered Chairman Mao's teaching, "To be frugal is to make revolution," and seeing the black coal being wasted away, he felt heartbroken. He began to dig out the coal from the pits with a shovel. Because the slope was steep and the path narrow, every shovel required a lot of effort. Some comrades saw him sweating profusely and advised him, "Why bother with such a small amount of coal?" Little Lü heard this and felt it was wrong, so he said to everyone, "Chairman Mao teaches us 'To be frugal is to make revolution.' We must not be afraid of hard work to carry out Chairman Mao's instructions. The more difficult it is, the more we must follow through." The comrades heard Little Lü's words and said, "Right! We must firmly carry out Chairman Mao's teachings. Every drop of water forms a river, every grain of rice fills a basket. Producing an extra block of coal is an extra contribution to the revolution, adding another brick to the construction of socialism."

Everyone said this and started to work together, digging out the coal that had been left in the pits, and sweeping the floating coal on the working face, conveyor belt, and chute clean, before going up the shaft to rest.

After that, they continued to do this every day. Over time, it became a habit. In more than two months, they cleaned out an additional 1,750 tons of raw coal for the country.

### 节约闹革命的好习惯

　　节约闹革命的好习惯
    抚顺红旗矿一○九队采煤队的革命职工有一个好习惯：每天下班后总要把溜子道、掌子面、皮带道上的浮煤和填在坑坑凹凹里的煤块掏得干干净净，然后才上井。
    说起他们这个习惯，还有一段来由。
    一天，吕宏金下班后，发现掌子面有一些大坑小穴，被煤块填得满满的。吕宏金想起毛主席“要节约闹革命”的教导，看到黑油油的煤白白浪费掉，感到痛心。他就把这些煤从坑里一锹一锹地挖出来。由于坡陡道窄，每挖一锹都要费好大的劲。有的同志看他累得满头大汗，就劝他说：“一星半点的煤何必费那么大的劲！”小吕听了，觉得这话不对，就对大家说：“毛主席教导我们‘要节约闹革命’，执行毛主席的指示咱可不能怕费劲，越是困难，越要照办。”同志们听了小吕的话，都说：对！毛主席的教导我们一定要坚决执行。滴水汇成河，粒米凑成箩。多生产一块煤，就是对革命多一分贡献，为社会主义建设多添一块砖瓦。
    大家说着，就一齐动手，把遗弃在坑里的煤一点一点地掏出来，又把掌子面、皮带道、溜子道里的浮煤扫得干干净净，才上井休息。
    以后，他们每天坚持这样做，天长日久，便成了习惯。两个多月的时间，为国家多扫出原煤一千七百五十多吨。卫东　柳忠东
