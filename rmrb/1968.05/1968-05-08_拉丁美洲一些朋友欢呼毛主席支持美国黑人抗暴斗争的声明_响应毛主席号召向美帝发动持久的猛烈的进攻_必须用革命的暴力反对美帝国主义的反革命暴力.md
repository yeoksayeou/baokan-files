Some Latin American friends continue to cheer Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. They say that Chairman Mao's statement is not only a support and encouragement to American blacks who are in the struggle, but also to all the oppressed and revolutionaries in the world.

A Puerto Rican friend said, "Chairman Mao's statement is a powerful support and solidarity with the rising revolutionary struggle of our black brothers in the United States. Chairman Mao correctly analyzed the struggle of American blacks from the standpoint of Marxism-Leninism. As Chairman Mao pointed out, the struggle of American blacks is the new call to arms for all the exploited and oppressed people in the United States against the brutal rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie."

This Puerto Rican friend continued, "The struggle of American blacks, like the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people and the peoples of other countries, is also the call to arms for the fighting people of Puerto Rico, who are oppressed and under colonial rule. I understand and recognize from my own experience that Chairman Mao's statement is 'not only a support and encouragement to American blacks who are in the struggle, but also to all revolutionaries in the world.'"

A Cuban friend said, "Chairman Mao has pointed out the correct path for the struggle of American blacks against violence. He said: To achieve final victory, 'we must learn from and follow the teachings of Chairman Mao Tse-tung in the two very important statements he issued in 1963 and 1968. Only by mastering Mao Tse-tung's thought can the masses of American blacks achieve thorough liberation.'"

Another Cuban friend said, "Chairman Mao's statement is a great support and encouragement to the struggle of the Vietnamese people and the peoples of all countries against U.S. imperialism. He said, to achieve thorough liberation for American blacks, we must overthrow and smash the colonial system."

Earlier, two American friends residing in Cuba also spoke to a Xinhua News Agency correspondent, expressing their firm support for Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence.

	HAVANA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Some Latin American friends continue to cheer Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. They say that Chairman Mao's statement is not only a support and encouragement to American blacks who are in the struggle, but also to all the oppressed and revolutionaries in the world.

	BOGOTA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Workers and students in Colombia enthusiastically cheer Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. They unanimously say: Chairman Mao's statement is a great concern for the oppressed peoples of the world, and is a source of strength for the revolutionary peoples of the world to oppose U.S. imperialism, the common enemy of the peoples of the world.

	A Colombian black worker said, "Chairman Mao's statement really moved me. Chairman Mao said: 'The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which rose to prosperity with the enslavement and trafficking of blacks, will also come to an end with the thorough liberation of the black race.' This point is very profound, and is a great development of Marxism-Leninism in the contemporary world. He said, Chairman Mao's works are the most precious weapons we use to oppose U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. We have come to realize through various issues that if we do not use Mao Tse-tung Thought, we will go astray."

	This black worker said, "Chairman Mao's statement calls on us to fight to defeat the U.S. aggressors. We will most loyally respond to Chairman Mao's call. We workers, peasants, students, intellectuals, and all progressive strata must unite to smash the evil rule of U.S. imperialism."

	A medical student from the University of Colombia said, "Chairman Mao's statement tells us, 'All those who truly want to defeat U.S. imperialism must make up their minds to follow the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao long ago: only by taking up arms and using revolutionary violence can we smash the counter-revolutionary violence of U.S. imperialism.'"

	A university student in the political science department pointed out: Many university students in Colombia have the deepest respect for Chairman Mao. They all highly praise Chairman Mao's great concern for the oppressed peoples of the world.

	An economics student said, "Chairman Mao's statement, like many of Chairman Mao's other works, 'is a source of strength for us to oppose U.S. imperialism, the common enemy of the peoples of the world, and is a great force that boosts the morale of the oppressed peoples of the world. When the peoples of all countries fully understand all this, no enemy can resist the struggle of the peoples of all countries.'"

	A Colombian revolutionary said excitedly: "How I love Chairman Mao! No one in the world is as close to the hearts of the oppressed and exploited peoples as Chairman Mao!" He said, Chairman Mao's statement points out the way we should go: to take revolutionary violence as the main form of our revolutionary activities, to unite all workers, peasants, and all those oppressed and exploited by U.S. imperialism, to oppose U.S. imperialism, and to accelerate its thorough collapse.

	This revolutionary pointed out that Chairman Mao's statement has profound historical significance and is a great encouragement to American blacks and all the oppressed peoples of the world. He said, we should respond to Chairman Mao's call, take immediate action, and launch a fierce and sustained attack on U.S. imperialism.

	He concluded by wishing Chairman Mao long life!

　　拉丁美洲一些朋友欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明
　　响应毛主席号召向美帝发动持久的猛烈的进攻
　　必须用革命的暴力反对美帝国主义的反革命暴力
    新华社哈瓦那六日电　拉丁美洲一些朋友在继续欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明时说，毛主席的声明不仅是对正在斗争中的美国黑人、而且也是对世界上所有被压迫者和革命者的支持和鼓舞。
    一位波多黎各朋友说，毛主席的声明是对美国黑人兄弟日益高涨的革命斗争的有力的支持和声援。他说，毛主席在声明中对美国黑人斗争作了马克思列宁主义的正确分析。正如毛主席指出的那样，美国黑人的斗争，是整个被剥削与被压迫的美国人民反对垄断资产阶级残暴统治的新号角。
    这位波多黎各朋友继续说，美国黑人的斗争，同英雄的越南人民和其他各国人民的斗争一样，也是被压迫和遭受殖民统治的波多黎各人民的战斗的号角。他说，他从自己切身体会中了解和认识到，毛主席的声明“不仅是对正在斗争中的美国黑人、而且是对世界上所有的革命者的支持和鼓舞”。
    一位古巴朋友说，毛主席为美国黑人抗暴斗争指出了正确的道路。他说：为了争取最后胜利，“必须学习和遵循毛泽东主席在一九六三年和一九六八年发表的两篇极为重要的声明中的教导，只有掌握毛主席的思想，美国黑人群众才能取得彻底解放”。
    另一位古巴朋友说，毛主席的声明是对越南人民以及全世界各国人民反对美帝国主义斗争的巨大支持和鼓舞。他说，要使美国黑人取得彻底解放，就要推翻和摧毁殖民主义制度。
    在此以前，两位旅居古巴的美国朋友也向新华社记者发表谈话，表示坚决支持毛主席发表的支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。
    新华社六日讯　波哥大消息：哥伦比亚工人、学生热烈欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。他们一致认为：毛主席的声明是对世界被压迫人民的巨大关怀，是鼓舞世界革命人民反对全世界人民公敌美帝国主义的力量源泉。
    一位哥伦比亚黑人工人说，毛主席的声明真使我太感动了。毛主席说：“万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”这一论点非常深刻，是马克思列宁主义在当代世界一个伟大的发展。他说，毛主席的著作是我们用来反对美帝国主义及其帮凶的最宝贵的武器。我们通过各种问题认识到，假如我们不运用毛泽东思想，我们就要走错路。
    这位黑人工人说，毛主席的声明号召我们为打败美国侵略者而斗争，我们一定最忠诚地响应毛主席的号召。我们工人、农民、学生、知识分子和所有进步阶层要团结起来，打垮美帝国主义的罪恶统治。
    一位哥伦比亚医科大学生说，毛主席的声明告诉我们，“所有真正要打败美帝国主义的人，都要下决心执行毛主席早就指出的方向：只有使用武器，通过革命的暴力，才能打垮美帝国主义反革命的暴力。”
    一位政治系的大学生指出：哥伦比亚许多大学生对毛主席怀有最深切的敬意。他们都高度赞扬毛主席对世界被压迫人民巨大的关怀。
    一位经济系的大学生说，毛主席的声明，象毛主席的其他许多著作一样，“是鼓舞我们反对全世界人民公敌美帝国主义的力量源泉，是大长全世界被压迫人民的志气的巨大力量。当各国人民都完全懂得了这一切时，就没有任何敌人能够抵抗世界各国人民的斗争。”
    一位哥伦比亚革命者激动地说：“我对毛主席多么热爱啊！世界上没有谁象毛主席那样同被压迫被剥削人民的心贴得这么近！”他说，毛主席的声明指明了应该走的道路：以革命暴力作为我们革命活动的主要形式，团结所有的工人、农民和一切受美帝国主义压迫剥削的人，反对美帝国主义，以加速它的彻底崩溃。
    这位革命者指出，毛主席的声明具有深刻的历史意义，对美国黑人以及全世界被压迫人民是极大的鼓舞。他说，我们应该响应毛主席的号召，立即行动起来，对美帝国主义开展一个猛烈的持久的进攻。
    他最后敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！
