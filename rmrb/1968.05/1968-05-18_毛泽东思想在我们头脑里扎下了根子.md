Mao Zedong Thought has taken root in our minds. We are active learners and users of Mao Zedong Thought. We are poor peasants from Hongjin Brigade, Taicang County, Jiangsu Province.

Our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao personally directed the formulation of the May 16th Circular by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966. This circular proposed the theory, line, policy, and principles for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, sounding the charge for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjin Brigade enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call, actively participating in this fiery class struggle. We launched a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, such as Liu Shaoqi, and pushed the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new stage, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants. With Chairman Mao's leadership and the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, we have today. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjin Brigade often recall the bitterness and sweetness of the past. The old society was our hell, truly bitter as gall and rhubarb, bitter to the core; the new society is our paradise, truly sweet as dates and honey, sweet to the core. The more we think about the old society and Liu Shaoqi, the more we hate them; the more we compare with the new society, the more we love it; and the more loyal we are to our great leader Chairman Mao. Everyone says: "The stars in the sky are countless, the water in rivers and seas is endless; Chairman Mao's kindness is deeper than the sea, Chairman Mao is closer than parents." We have made up our minds: no matter how much things change, our red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao will never change; even if the earth shakes and the mountains crumble, we will forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Taicang, Jiangsu, sing the same black tune, wear the same black pants, sit on the same black bench, and walk the same black path as the Kuomintang reactionaries. They oppose Mao Zedong Thought and attempt to restore capitalism, making us suffer again. We will never allow it! During the Cultural Revolution, we held large meetings to expose and small meetings to accuse, denounced them in the fields during the day and criticized them at home at night, thoroughly criticizing Liu Shaoqi and his agents' reactionary revisionist black goods such as "exploitation is meritorious," "three selfs and one package," "four freedoms," "material incentives," and "the extinction of class struggle." Through persistent revolutionary criticism, our eyes are clearer and our hearts are redder. We use supporting Chairman Mao or opposing Chairman Mao, loving Mao Zedong Thought or opposing Mao Zedong Thought, as the standard to distinguish between ourselves and the enemy. Whoever dares to oppose Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought is our enemy, and we will resolutely fight them to the end!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism." Vice Chairman Lin instructs us: "Revolution also means revolutionizing oneself. Without revolutionizing oneself, the revolution cannot be successful." We realize that "selfishness" is the root of "revisionism." Unless we overcome "selfishness," we cannot thoroughly criticize "revisionism." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we combine the struggle against selfishness with the criticism of revisionism. Through this struggle, everyone's spiritual outlook has undergone profound changes. Revolutionary masses learn from Zhang Side, everyone learns from Norman Bethune, dedicating their hearts to Chairman Mao and serving the people wholeheartedly. Reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions have become the first need in the lives and struggles of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjin. The entire brigade's revolutionary masses all have "Quotations from Chairman Mao," everyone has the "Three Constantly Read Articles," and every household has established a study group. From the elderly over eighty to children as young as six, everyone follows Vice Chairman Lin's instruction to "study Chairman Mao's many fundamental viewpoints repeatedly, and memorize some of the aphorisms." We extensively study, recite, expound, and apply Chairman Mao's works, and sing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations. Mao Zedong Thought has taken root in the minds of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjin, achieving unprecedented popularity throughout the brigade.

    毛泽东思想在我们头脑里扎下了根子
    活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子
    江苏省太仓县洪泾大队贫农社员  顾阿桃
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，提出了在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，吹响了无产阶级文化大革命的进军号。我们洪泾大队贫下中农热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，积极投入了这场火热的阶级斗争，向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派发起猛烈进攻，把活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动推向了一个新阶段，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得更高、更高！
    毛主席是我们贫下中农心中最红最红的红太阳。有了毛主席的领导，有了毛泽东思想的光辉照耀，才有我们贫下中农的今天。我们洪泾大队的贫下中农经常忆苦思甜。旧社会是我们的地狱，真是苦胆加黄连，苦透苦透；新社会是我们的天堂，真是红枣加蜜糖，甜透甜透。大家越想对旧社会和中国赫鲁晓夫越恨，越比对新社会越爱，对伟大领袖毛主席越忠。大家说：“天上星星数不清，河水海水舀不尽；毛主席的恩情比海深，毛主席比爹娘还要亲。”我们下定决心：千变万变，忠于毛主席的红心永不变；地动山摇，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗永远不动摇！
    中国赫鲁晓夫和他在江苏太仓的代理人，同国民党反动派唱一个黑调子，穿一条黑裤子，坐一条黑凳子，走一条黑路子。他们反对毛泽东思想，妄想复辟资本主义，使我们再吃二遍苦。我们一万个不答应！在文化大革命中，我们大会揭露，小会控诉，白天在田头声讨，晚上在家庭批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人的“剥削有功”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“物质刺激”、“阶级斗争熄灭”论等反革命修正主义黑货批判得臭臭的！通过持久的革命大批判，我们眼更明，心更红。我们把拥护毛主席还是反对毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想还是反对毛泽东思想，作为分清自己人和敌人的标准。谁胆敢反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，谁就是我们的敌人，我们就坚决和他拚，拚到底！
    毛主席教导我们：“要斗私，批修”。林副主席指示我们：“革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”我们认识到，“私”字是“修”字的根子。“私”字不斗倒，“修”字批不臭。我们遵照毛主席的教导，批修结合斗私。通过斗私批修，大家的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。革命群众人人学习张思德，个个学习白求恩，一颗红心献给毛主席，完全彻底为人民。读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，已经成了我们洪泾贫下中农生活和斗争的第一需要。全大队革命群众人人有《毛主席语录》，个个有“老三篇”，户户建立了学习小组。上至八十多岁的老人，下到六岁的小孩，都遵照林副主席的“要反复学习毛主席的许多基本观点，有些警句最好要背熟”的指示，大学、大背、大讲、大用毛主席著作，大唱毛主席语录歌。毛泽东思想在我们贫下中农头脑里扎下了根子，在我们洪泾大队空前大普及。
