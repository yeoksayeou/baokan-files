Chairman Mao's great policy of the revolutionary three-in-one combination has creatively developed Marxism-Leninism state theory. The people of the entire nation enthusiastically acclaim the revolutionary committees.

The widespread emergence of revolutionary committees across the country is a great organizational victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the inspiration of the "Notice" personally drafted by Chairman Mao. We must cherish and support the newly born revolutionary committees, making them increasingly consolidated and perfected. In regions and units where revolutionary committees have not yet been established, we must, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," promptly facilitate their establishment.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 19th, under the brilliant guidance of the "Notice" personally drafted by Chairman Mao and the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on May 16, 1966, and under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat across the country have achieved decisive victories in their struggle to seize power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Revolutionary committees following the "three-in-one" principle have spread across cities and countryside throughout the nation. As the nation solemnly commemorates the second anniversary of the issuance of the "Notice," the people of the entire nation are repeatedly studying the "Notice" and the important article "A Great Document of the New Era," enthusiastically acclaiming "Long live the revolutionary committees," and resolutely supporting and defending the revolutionary committees. They are determined to further strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, consolidate, and develop the great organizational victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The people across the nation also expressed their determination: Under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, lead by the revolutionary committees at all levels, and launch relentless attacks on all enemies of the proletariat without pause, seizing complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The Great Leader Chairman Mao Personally Cultivates New Sprouts
	"The Three-in-One" Revolutionary Committees Are Great

One year ago, when the new thing, the revolutionary committee, first appeared on the eastern horizon, our great teacher and leader, Chairman Mao, with the great genius of a proletarian revolutionary, foresaw far into the future and pointed out: "In places and units where power must be seized, the revolutionary 'three-in-one' policy must be implemented to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat. The name of this power organ is 'revolutionary committee'." Now, as the nation celebrates the second anniversary of the issuance of the "Notice," the people across the nation excitedly see that Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Shandong, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guizhou, Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Ningxia, and 23 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have established revolutionary committees. The four provinces and autonomous regions of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangxi, Fujian, Xinjiang, and Tibet, which have not yet established revolutionary committees, are promoting their birth with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day." The revolutionary committees in prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and counties, as well as in factories, enterprises, schools, government agencies, and rural people's communes at the grassroots level, are being established one after another. The revolutionary committees emerging across the nation are like bright red banners waving in the wind over the vast land of the motherland. The revolutionary committees at all levels are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, fully implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, leading the broad revolutionary masses to launch more fierce attacks on class enemies, fully demonstrating their vigorous and powerful vitality. The broad revolutionary masses praise, "The 'three-in-one' revolutionary committees are great, truly great!"

	Chairman Mao's Great Policy of the Revolutionary Three-in-One Combination
	Creatively Develops Marxism-Leninism State Theory

Chairman Mao pointed out: "'The 'three-in-one' revolutionary committee is a creation of the proletariat and the people in this cultural revolution." As the people across the nation acclaim the widespread emergence of revolutionary committees, they enthusiastically praise Chairman Mao for personally discovering, affirming, and summarizing the creation of tens of millions of revolutionary masses, proposing the great policy of the revolutionary three-in-one combination. They say, Chairman Mao's great policy has greatly enriched and developed the Marxist-Leninist state theory. The revolutionary masses in many units in Beijing and Tianjin that have established revolutionary committees pointed out that the revolutionary committees include representatives of revolutionary cadres, who have rich revolutionary struggle experience and play the role of leading cadres; representatives of the military, who strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat and enhance the power of the struggle against the enemy; and representatives of the revolutionary masses, who ensure that the revolutionary committees have a broad mass base and guarantee the blood-and-flesh relationship between the revolutionary committees and the masses. Wang Guozhan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee and a national model worker in agriculture, said, "The emergence of the 'three-in-one' revolutionary committees is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great innovation of the proletarian revolutionary forces and tens of millions of revolutionary masses in their struggle to seize power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party." The unity of military and civilians, military and government, and cadres and masses in the revolutionary committees is an important guarantee for the victory of our proletarian revolutionary cause. The broad revolutionary masses praise, "Chairman Mao's policy of the revolutionary three-in-one combination is great!" Some members of the revolutionary committees of Huangpu District and Hongkou District in Shanghai praised, The military representatives participating in the district revolutionary committees have brought the fine revolutionary traditions of the People's Liberation Army, such as studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought actively, adhering to the four firsts, and carrying forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, into the revolutionary committees, promoting the thought revolutionization of the leading cadres, making the revolutionary cadre representatives more closely connected with the masses, and the revolutionary mass representatives maintaining the character of the working people, actively contributing to the construction of the revolutionary committees in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings into a revolutionary and mass-connected leading cadre.

	Following the Teachings of the Great Leader Chairman Mao
	Widely Mobilize the Masses to Exercise Dictatorship over the Class Enemies

Chairman Mao has long taught us: "Without extensive people's democracy, the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be consolidated, and the power will be unstable. Without democracy, without mobilizing the masses, without the supervision of the masses, it is impossible to effectively exercise dictatorship over reactionaries and bad elements, nor is it possible to effectively reform them. They will continue to make trouble and have the possibility of a comeback. This problem should be alerted to, and I hope comrades will think about it carefully." The proletarian revolutionary forces, revolutionary masses, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army across the nation have seriously studied Chairman Mao's great teachings and have a deeper understanding that the great new thing, the revolutionary committees discovered, affirmed, and supported by Chairman Mao, have played a tremendous revolutionary role in widely mobilizing the revolutionary masses to participate in the exercise of dictatorship over class enemies. The comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Shanghai Metallurgical Industry Bureau said, after the establishment of our bureau's revolutionary committee, a handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders, unwilling to accept their defeat, stirred up a wave of revisionist wind, and some reactionary capitalists, blinded by profit, engaged in "underground connections," attempting to overthrow the newly born revolutionary committees. We relied on the revolutionary masses to expose the enemy's plots and, relying on the broad revolutionary masses, launched fierce attacks on the class enemies, finally smashing the revisionist wind stirred up by the class enemies. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committees, the broad revolutionary masses have played a tremendous role in the struggle to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. Many revolutionary mass representatives participating in the revolutionary committees at all levels in the Ningxia region, in the fierce class struggle, went deep into the grassroots, rooted among the broad revolutionary masses, investigated and studied the new trends and situations of class struggle, timely discovered the various plots of the class enemies, severely struck the enemies, and greatly strengthened the dictatorship of the proletariat. The soldiers and officers of the Nanjing Military Region participating in the "three supports and two militaries" work said, the revolutionary masses have the deepest feelings for the proletarian political power and the deepest hatred for the class enemies. The revolutionary masses' ears and eyes are also the sharpest; the class enemies' every move does not escape the bright eyes of the revolutionary masses. The situation in many units shows that to expose hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries, one must rely on the revolutionary masses; to effectively exercise the dictatorship of the proletariat over this handful of class enemies, one must also rely on the revolutionary masses.

	Following the Teachings of the Great Leader Chairman Mao
	Build the Revolutionary Committees into Revolutionary Battle Command Posts

Chairman Mao recently taught us: "The basic experience of the revolutionary committees has three points: one is to have representatives of revolutionary cadres, one is to have representatives of the military, and one is to have representatives of the revolutionary masses, realizing the revolutionary three-in-one combination. The revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organs, streamline and downsize, and organize a revolutionary and mass-connected leading cadre." The members of the revolutionary committees at all levels across the nation are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, build the newly born revolutionary committees into battle command posts that forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, lead the broad revolutionary masses to launch relentless attacks on the class enemies, continuously seize new victories, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and ensure that the proletarian iron mountain will never change color. The members of the Revolutionary Committee of Wuhan Chemical Factory, born in the storm of class struggle, deeply felt that the revolutionary committees born in the storm of class struggle must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasp the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, and build themselves into revolutionary leading cadres in the storm of class struggle. The members of the Revolutionary Committee of Changwei Region in Shandong Province, advancing on the road of revolutionization, followed Chairman Mao's teachings, reviewed the work of the revolutionary committee, and summarized their experiences. They said: To build the "three-in-one" revolutionary committees into a strong command post for learning, propagating, executing, and defending Mao Zedong Thought, and a strong command post for leading the broad revolutionary masses to launch uninterrupted attacks on the class enemies, the most fundamental thing is to rely on Chairman Mao from above and the revolutionary masses from below. Now, more than 80% of the standing committee members and most of the working staff of this revolutionary committee have gone deep into the masses and to the front line of class struggle, serving as both commanders and fighters, launching new attacks on the class enemies.

The revolutionary mass representatives participating in the Revolutionary Committee of Zunyi Region said, we revolutionary mass representatives participating in the revolutionary committee will not disappoint Chairman Mao's earnest expectations and the trust of the broad proletarian revolutionary forces. We will redouble our efforts to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively, continually raise our class consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines, act in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought in all work, insist on the high principles of the proletariat, fully play the role of the basic forces, and wage a tenacious struggle against all anti-Mao Zedong Thought words and deeds, resolutely defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The military representatives participating in the revolutionary committees at all levels in Guangzhou City said, we must take up the glorious task entrusted to us by Chairman Mao to "propagandize, organize, arm, and build the revolutionary political power among the people," bring the principle of emphasizing political construction of the army into the revolutionary committees, help the leading cadres of the revolutionary committees at all levels build a power organ that has proletarian authority, is closely connected with the masses, and is full of vitality. To complete this glorious task, the most fundamental thing is to grasp our own thought revolutionization and be good revolutionary vanguards; to take the lead in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought actively, change our worldview; to take the lead in grasping class struggle, emphasize proletarian politics, and insist on the four firsts; to take the lead in grasping rooting in the grassroots and closely connecting with the masses, study, labor, and criticize and repudiate revisionism with the revolutionary masses; to take the lead in carrying forward the glorious tradition of hard struggle, forever maintain the character of an ordinary soldier.

	Following the Teachings of the Great Leader Chairman Mao
	Defend the Newly Born Revolutionary Committees with Struggle

Chairman Mao taught us: "The rights obtained by the people must not be allowed to be easily lost and must be defended with struggle." As the people across the nation enthusiastically acclaim the birth of revolutionary committees at all levels, they are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, cherish and support the revolutionary committees with all their hearts, help them consolidate and develop continuously, and defend the newly born revolutionary committees with struggle, resolutely strike down all the plots of the class enemies to sabotage and overthrow the revolutionary committees; resolutely oppose right opportunism, right capitulationism, and right splitism, thoroughly smash the right revisionist wind, and defend the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin and the newly born revolutionary committees to the death. They say: If the class enemies dare to sabotage and overthrow the revolutionary committees, we will smash them to pieces! The members of the revolutionary committees at all levels of the Inner Mongolia Forestry Management Bureau and the broad revolutionary masses of the Workers' and Red Guards' Congresses in the Da Xing'anling Forest Area said, a handful of unrepentant capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries are terrified and hate the "three-in-one" revolutionary committees to death, always looking for opportunities to sabotage and overthrow them. We must be a hundred times more vigilant and prevent the sabotage of the class enemies. We must raise our attitude and feelings towards the revolutionary committees to the height of loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, regard supporting and defending the newly born revolutionary committees as our sacred duty. The soldiers of the "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" recently reviewed their struggle practices in participating in and defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years. They excitedly said: The newly born revolutionary committees are vigorous revolutionary new things supported by our great leader Chairman Mao. Defending the dictatorship of the proletariat is a glorious task entrusted to us by Chairman Mao, the Party, and the people. We must, like the hero platoon leader Li Wentong, do as Chairman Mao loves, as Chairman Mao supports, as Chairman Mao instructs, and as Chairman Mao waves his hand, we advance, resolutely defend the newly born revolutionary committees. The soldiers of the PLA stationed in Hunan Province, fighting on the front lines of the "three supports and two militaries" and participating in the work of revolutionary committees at all levels, expressed their determination to Chairman Mao: We must, together with all members of the revolutionary committees, better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively, further implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to emphasize proletarian politics, never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and strive for new achievements in seizing complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    毛主席的革命三结合的伟大方针创造性地发展了马列主义国家学说
    全国亿万军民齐声欢呼革命委员会好
    全国各地革命委员会的联翩出现，是在毛主席主持制定的《通知》的鼓舞下，无产阶级文化大革命在组织上的大胜利。我们要爱护和支持新生的革命委员会，使它不断地巩固和完善。没有成立革委会的地区和单位，要以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，尽快地促使它成立
    据新华社十九日讯　在伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》的光辉照耀下，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，我国无产阶级革命派取得了向党内一小撮走资派进行夺权斗争的决定性胜利，“三结合”的革命委员会已经遍布祖国城乡各地。全国亿万军民在隆重纪念《通知》发表两周年的时候，反复学习《通知》和《划时代的文献》这篇重要文章，热烈欢呼“革命委员会好”，决心热情地爱护革命委员会，坚决地支持革命委员会，积极地帮助革命委员会，勇敢地捍卫革命委员会，进一步加强无产阶级专政，巩固和发展无产阶级文化大革命在组织上取得的伟大胜利。
    各地亿万军民还表示：一定要在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导下，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在各级革命委员会的带领下，不停顿地向无产阶级的一切敌人发动猛烈进攻，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
        伟大领袖毛主席亲手育新苗
      “三结合”的革命委员会就是好
    一年前，当革命委员会这个新生事物刚刚出现在东方地平线上的时候，我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖毛主席，就以无产阶级革命家的伟大天才，高瞻远瞩地指出：“在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的‘三结合’的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。这个权力机构的名称，叫革命委员会好。”现在，当举国上下欢庆《通知》发表两周年的时候，各地亿万军民兴奋地看到，北京、上海、天津、河北、山西、内蒙古、黑龙江、吉林、辽宁、山东、江西、安徽、江苏、浙江、河南、湖北、湖南、广东、贵州、青海、甘肃、陕西、宁夏等二十三个省、市、自治区，已经成立了革命委员会。还没有成立革命委员会的四川、云南、广西、福建、新疆、西藏等六个省、自治区，正在以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，促进革命委员会的诞生。各省、市、自治区所属的专区、自治州和县，以及工厂、企业、学校、机关和农村人民公社等基层单位，革命委员会更是一批又一批地接踵诞生。各地联翩出现的革命委员会，象一面面鲜艳夺目的红旗，在祖国的大地上迎风招展。各级革命委员会高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，领导广大革命群众向阶级敌人展开更加猛烈的进攻，充分显示了朝气勃勃的强大生命力。广大革命群众赞扬说，“三结合”的革命委员会就是好，好得很！
      毛主席的革命三结合的伟大方针
    创造性地发展了马列主义国家学说
    毛主席指出：“‘三结合’的革命委员会，是工人阶级和人民群众在这次文化大革命中的一种创造。”各地亿万军民在欢呼革命委员会联翩出现的时候，极其热烈地歌颂毛主席亲自发现、肯定和总结亿万革命群众的创造，提出了革命三结合的伟大方针。他们说，毛主席提出的伟大方针，大大丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义的国家学说。北京、天津等地许多已经建立革命委员会的单位的革命群众纷纷指出，革命委员会中有革命干部的代表，他们有丰富的革命斗争经验，发挥了领导骨干的作用；有军队的代表，有力地加强了无产阶级专政，加强了对敌斗争的威力；有革命群众的代表，保证了革命委员会有广泛的群众基础，保证了革命委员会和群众的血肉相连的关系。河北省革命委员会常委、全国农业劳动模范王国藩说，“三结合”的革命委员会的出现，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是我国无产阶级革命派和亿万革命群众向党内一小撮走资派进行夺权斗争的伟大创举。革命干部代表、军队代表和革命群众代表在革委会中保持血肉般的联系，这种军民团结、军政团结、干群团结，是我们无产阶级革命事业取得胜利的重要保证。广大革命群众赞扬说：“毛主席的革命三结合方针就是好！”上海黄浦区和虹口区革命委员会的一些成员赞扬说，参加区革命委员会的军队代表，把人民解放军活学活用毛泽东思想、坚持四个第一、大兴三八作风等优良革命传统带进了革委会，促进了领导班子的思想革命化，使革命干部代表更加密切联系群众，革命群众代表保持着劳动人民的本色，为革命委员会遵照毛主席的教导建设成革命化的联系群众的领导班子，作出了积极的贡献。
      遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导
    广泛发动群众对阶级敌人专政
    毛主席早就教导我们：“没有广泛的人民民主，无产阶级专政不能巩固，政权会不稳。没有民主，没有把群众发动起来，没有群众的监督，就不可能对反动分子和坏分子实行有效的专政，也不可能对他们进行有效的改造，他们就会继续捣乱，还有复辟的可能。这个问题应当警惕，也希望同志们好好想一想。”各地无产阶级革命派、革命群众和人民解放军指战员，认真学习了毛主席的这一伟大教导，他们更加深刻地认识到，毛主席发现、肯定和支持的伟大新事物革命委员会，在广泛发动革命群众参加对阶级敌人的专政方面，发挥了巨大的革命威力。上海市冶金工业局革命委员会的同志们说，我们局革委会成立以后，一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派等阶级敌人，不甘心于他们的失败，刮起了一股翻案妖风，有些反动资本家利令智昏，搞什么“地下串连”，妄图颠覆新生的革命委员会。我们依靠革命群众查出了阶级敌人的这些阴谋活动，又依靠广大革命群众向阶级敌人发动猛烈的进攻，终于粉碎了阶级敌人刮起的翻案妖风。广大革命群众在革委会的带领下，在加强无产阶级专政的斗争中，发挥了巨大作用。宁夏地区许多参加各级革命委员会的革命群众代表，在激烈的阶级搏斗中，深入基层，扎根于广大革命群众之中，调查研究阶级斗争的新动向，新情况，及时发现了阶级敌人的种种阴谋活动，狠狠打击了敌人，大大加强了无产阶级专政。南京部队参加“三支”“两军”工作的指战员们说，革命群众对无产阶级政权感情最深，对阶级敌人最恨。革命群众的耳目也最灵，阶级敌人一举一动，都逃不过革命群众雪亮的眼睛。许多单位的情况都说明，挖出隐藏的叛徒、特务和反革命分子，要依靠革命群众；对这一小撮阶级敌人实行有效的无产阶级专政，也必须依靠革命群众。
        遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导
    把革委会建设成革命的战斗指挥部
    毛主席最近教导我们：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”全国各地各级革命委员会的成员们，决心遵照毛主席的教导，把新生的革命委员会建设成为永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的、突出无产阶级政治的战斗指挥部，带领广大革命群众向阶级敌人不断发起猛烈进攻，不断夺取新胜利，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，保证无产阶级铁打江山永不变色。在阶级斗争大风大浪中诞生的武汉化工厂革命委员会成员们联系切身的斗争实践，深有体会地说：在阶级斗争风浪中诞生的革委会，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，在阶级斗争的风浪中建设成为革命化的领导班子。正在革命化的大道上阔步前进的山东省昌潍地区革命委员会的成员们，遵照毛主席的教导，检查了革委会的工作，总结了经验。他们说：要想把“三结合”的革命委员会建设成为学习、宣传、执行、捍卫毛泽东思想的坚强指挥部，建设成为带领广大革命群众不停顿地向阶级敌人主动进攻的坚强指挥部，最根本的根本，是上靠毛主席，下靠革命群众。现在，这个革委会的百分之八十以上的常委、委员和绝大多数工作人员，已经深入群众，深入到阶级斗争第一线，既当指挥员，又当战斗员，向阶级敌人发起了新的进攻。
    参加遵义地区革命委员会的革命群众代表说，我们参加革命委员会的革命群众代表，决不辜负毛主席的殷切期望和广大无产阶级革命派的信任，要加倍地努力活学活用毛泽东思想，不断提高阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，在一切工作中坚决按照毛泽东思想办事，坚持无产阶级的高度原则性，充分发挥基础力量的作用，同一切反毛泽东思想的言行进行顽强的斗争，誓死捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。参加广州市各级革命委员会的军队代表同志们说，我们一定要把毛主席交给我们的“对群众的宣传、组织、武装和建设革命政权”的光荣任务担负起来，把我军着重政治建军的原则带进革命委员会，帮助革命委员会的各级领导班子，建设成为有无产阶级权威的、密切联系群众的、朝气蓬勃的权力机构。要完成这一光荣任务，最根本的一条就是要抓好本身的思想革命化，当好革命化的带头人；要带头活学活用毛泽东思想，改造世界观；要带头狠抓阶级斗争、带头突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一；要带头抓好扎根基层，密切联系群众，和革命群众同学习、同劳动、同斗私批修；要带头发扬艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，永远保持普通一兵的本色。
    遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导
    用战斗来保卫新生的革命委员会
    毛主席教导我们：“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”全国广大军民在热烈欢呼各级革命委员会联翩诞生的时候，决心遵循毛主席的伟大教导，满腔热情地爱护和支持革命委员会，帮助它不断巩固和发展，并且要用战斗来保卫新生的革命委员会，坚决打击一切阶级敌人妄想破坏和颠覆革命委员会的阴谋；坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾投降主义、右倾分裂主义，彻底粉碎右倾翻案妖风，誓死保卫以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，保卫新生的革命委员会。他们说：阶级敌人胆敢破坏和颠覆革命委员会，我们就把他们砸个稀巴烂！内蒙古林业管理局各级革命委员会的成员以及大兴安岭林区工代会、红代会的广大革命群众说，一小撮顽固不化的走资派、叛徒、特务和反革命分子，对“三结合”的革命委员会怕得要死，恨得要命，总是在窥测方向，妄图进行破坏和颠覆。我们一定要百倍提高警惕，严防阶级敌人的破坏。我们一定要把对革命委员会的态度和感情，提到忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的高度来认识，把支持和保卫新生的革命委员会，当作自己的神圣职责。“支左爱民模范排”的指战员们，这几天回顾了两年来参加和保卫无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践。他们激动地说：新生的革命委员会，是得到我们伟大领袖毛主席支持的朝气蓬勃的革命新生事物。坚决保卫无产阶级专政，是毛主席、党和人民交给我们的光荣任务。我们一定要象英雄排长李文忠同志那样，做到“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进”，坚决保卫新生的革命委员会。湖南省驻军战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线和参加各级革命委员会工作的指战员，纷纷向伟大领袖毛主席表示决心说：我们一定要和革命委员会全体成员一起，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，进一步落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，永远念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出无产阶级政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功！
