The Ministry of Coal recently held a field meeting on frugality and revolution in the North China, Central South, and Northwest coal mines at the Jingxing Mining Bureau in Hebei. This is the second field meeting on frugality and revolution held by the Ministry of Coal, following the one in March and April at the Shandong Zaozhuang Mining Bureau for the East China and Northeast coal mines. This meeting calls on the revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of revolutionary workers in the national coal industry to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, to further raise the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, to fully implement Chairman Mao's great policies of "further frugality and revolution" and "frugal nation-building," to swiftly launch a new wave of mass production and frugality movement, and to achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The meeting promoted the experiences of the Jingxing Mining Bureau in combining revolution with production and frugality and revolution. The revolutionary workers of the Jingxing Mining District have firmly implemented Chairman Mao's great policies of "grasp revolution, promote production" and "further frugality and revolution." With an astonishing revolutionary will, they have overcome many difficulties. From January last year to April this year, they have consecutively completed the state production plan for sixteen months, achieving stable and high production. They have also carried out extensive repair and reuse of old equipment, saving materials from all aspects. Over the past year, the entire mining district has recovered and repaired metal supports, electric conveyor large chains, various steel materials, and other idle and discarded equipment and tools, with a total value of over 980,000 yuan. Of this, 740,000 yuan worth of old and discarded equipment and tools have been processed and repaired for use in production, not only ensuring the needs of coal production but also reducing the cost of raw coal.

The representatives at the meeting, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize the revisionist black goods promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents on the coal front, such as "material incentives." They further raised the class consciousness of the proletariat. Everyone recognized that frugality and waste are fundamentally opposed expressions of the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview. Frugality is not just an economic issue; it is a serious political struggle, a major issue in preventing and opposing revisionism and preventing capitalist restoration, a major issue in the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, and a major issue in whether the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat can grasp and use power well.

The representatives emphasized that coal is the grain of industrial production. In the face of the excellent and increasingly good situation of revolution and production on the national coal industry front, the enemies of the proletariat will inevitably adopt more sinister and vicious means to sabotage the revolution and production. The broad revolutionary workers on the coal industry front must heighten their revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold and wage unremitting struggles against the enemies of the proletariat. At the same time, they must mobilize the masses extensively to wage a "people's war" of frugality and revolution and repair and reuse old equipment, and resolutely struggle against the behaviors of extravagance and waste and the arbitrary loss and damage of state equipment, creating a strong public opinion that frugality is glorious and waste is shameful, making frugality and revolution a conscious action of the broad revolutionary masses.

The meeting believed that arming the broad masses of workers with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything and transform everything, and promoting the thought revolution of the people is the key to further carrying out the activities of frugality and revolution among the revolutionary workers in the national coal mines. The revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses in the national coal mines must be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and grasp the use of the great Mao Zedong Thought. They must study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively, promoting the thought revolution of the people.

　　煤炭部在井陉矿务局召开现场会议发出号召
　　全面落实毛主席节约闹革命最新指示
　　迅速掀起群众性增产节约运动新高潮
    据新华社石家庄九日电　煤炭部最近在河北井陉矿务局召开华北、中南、西北煤矿节约闹革命现场会议。这是煤炭部继三四月份在山东枣庄矿务局召开华东、东北煤矿节约闹革命修旧利废现场会议之后的又一次关于节约闹革命的现场会议。这次会议号召全国煤矿系统的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入持久地开展革命大批判，进一步提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，全面落实毛主席的“要进一步节约闹革命”和“勤俭建国”的伟大方针，迅速掀起群众性的增产节约运动的新高潮，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利立新功。
    会议推广了井陉矿务局抓革命促生产、节约闹革命的经验。井陉矿区的广大革命职工坚定不移地贯彻执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”、“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大方针。他们以惊人的革命意志，克服了很多困难，从去年一月份到今年四月份，连续十六个月超额完成了国家生产计划，做到了稳产高产。他们还大搞修旧利废，从各方面节约原料材料。一年多的时间里，全矿区共回收修复金属支柱、电溜子大链、各种钢材以及其他闲置废旧设备器材价值共达九十八万多元，其中已有价值七十四万多元的废旧设备器材，经过加工修复用于生产，不仅保证了煤炭生产的需要，而且降低了原煤成本。
    到会代表遵循毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在煤炭战线的代理人推行的“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货，进一步提高了无产阶级的阶级觉悟。大家认识到：节约和浪费是无产阶级世界观同资产阶级世界观根本对立的表现。勤俭节约，绝不仅仅是一个经济问题，而是一场严肃的政治斗争，是防修反修、防止资本主义复辟的大事，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的大事，是关系到无产阶级革命派能不能掌好权、用好权的大事。
    代表们着重指出，煤炭是工业生产的粮食。在全国煤炭工业战线革命和生产的形势大好，并且越来越好的形势下，无产阶级的敌人必然要采取各种更加阴险毒辣的手段，来破坏革命和生产。煤炭工业战线广大革命职工必须百倍提高革命警惕性，同无产阶级的敌人作不懈的斗争。同时要广泛发动群众，打一场节约闹革命和修旧利废的“人民战争”，坚决同铺张浪费、任意丢失损坏国家器材的行为作斗争，造成节约光荣，浪费可耻的强烈社会舆论，使节约闹革命成为广大革命群众的自觉行动。
    会议认为，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装广大职工群众，用毛泽东思想统帅一切、改造一切，促进人的思想革命化，是在全国煤矿革命职工中进一步开展节约闹革命活动的关键。全国煤矿无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，对伟大领袖毛主席要突出一个“忠”字，对伟大的毛泽东思想要狠抓一个“用”字，活学活用毛泽东思想，搞好人的思想革命化。
