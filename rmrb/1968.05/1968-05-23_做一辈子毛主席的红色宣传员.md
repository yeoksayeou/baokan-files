We, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress Suburban Food Management Office, have emerged from the fierce class struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, guided by Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." We have broken through the bourgeois reactionary line and, together with the broad masses of revolutionary proletarians, harbor deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev. We have displayed the fearless spirit of "daring to be skinned alive, daring to pull the emperor off his horse" and have rebelled against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, rebelled against the capitalist roaders within our unit, and ascended the revolutionary stage of literature and art. We use artistic forms to vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Through over a year of propaganda practice, we have deeply understood that literature and art are powerful weapons of class struggle. We workers, peasants, and soldiers must firmly grasp this weapon and use it well. The members of our propaganda team include salespersons, businesspeople, truck drivers, accountants, and cadres. Most of us did not know how to sing or dance in the past, but with our boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, we can overcome all difficulties. We learn, perform, and improve as we go. Here, we will focus on discussing our experiences in actively applying Chairman Mao's works, fighting against selfishness, carrying out ideological reform, and persistently engaging in amateur propaganda.

To propagate the great Mao Zedong Thought well, we must actively apply Chairman Mao's works, constantly reform our worldview, and raise our proletarian political awareness. The members of our propaganda team come from all directions and often have various thoughts. What should we do when we have ideological problems? Initially, we also had incorrect ideas, fearing that conducting ideological struggle would cause disputes and affect performances. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We advocate active ideological struggle because it is a weapon for achieving unity within the Party and revolutionary organizations, making them more effective in battle. Every Communist Party member and revolutionary should take up this weapon." Through study, we realized that covering up contradictions is wrong. Later, we strengthened our ideological and political work, frequently held study sessions and heart-to-heart talks, and conducted home visits. Everyone engaged in ideological and political work, constantly correcting personal fame-seeking and show-off thoughts. Some team members competed for roles, preferring leading roles over supporting roles, and preferred individual performances, such as solo singing. We organized everyone to study the "Three Articles," using Chairman Mao's teachings to examine ourselves. Through study and discussion, some team members said: "In the past, I competed for roles and the number of performances, which was selfishness at work. This does not align with Mao Zedong Thought. In the future, whatever role is assigned, I will perform it."

Additionally, some problems in the team members' units and families were not handled well, affecting the team members' mood. For example, some team members' units believed that performing was just playing and jumping around. Sometimes, external performances encountered difficulties in work shift arrangements. Based on these situations, we went to these units to do ideological work, introduced the propaganda team's situation, and sought their opinions. Through a series of efforts, some units changed from being unsupportive to supportive and proactively arranged time for the propaganda team to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Moreover, team members returned home late due to rehearsals and performances, indeed causing difficulties for their families. Thus, we visited the team members' families, sought opinions, conducted ideological work through visits, and obtained strong support from family members.

We are an amateur art propaganda team, with members coming from grassroots units. We must firmly plant our roots in the grassroots and among the masses, forever living and fighting with the masses, and never leaving our production posts. We should not only not let propaganda affect our work but also actively implement the call to "grasp revolution and promote production." During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the members of our propaganda team actively participated in the movement in our unit. Some were even service personnel for revolutionary mass organizations, fighting the revolution together with comrades, carrying out revolutionary criticism, and improving our unit. In work and production, we firmly held our posts, stood at the counters, engaged in production, and served the people. During the day, we stood at the counters to sell goods, worked in the workshops, drove trucks, and cut hair. In the evening, we gathered to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. No matter how late we returned at night, we insisted on grasping revolution and promoting production the next day. For example, when we went to distant areas to propagate and perform, we often returned around midnight. Team members rested at home around 1 a.m., but the next day, they still stood at the counters with revolutionary workers and engaged in production. The facts have proven that doing so not only earned us praise from the leaders and masses of our system but also facilitated long-term propaganda activities. When we performed in grassroots stores, we never forgot that we were laborers. For instance, one evening, during a performance at the Xiheshui Vegetable Market, two trucks of cabbages arrived. We temporarily stopped the performance and, together with revolutionary workers, unloaded the cabbages. After unloading, we continued the performance and were warmly welcomed by everyone. During our performances, we always thought of Chairman Mao's teachings and took the PLA comrades as our examples, using our actions to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Over the past year, except for a few special situations that occupied some work time, we have always insisted on amateur propaganda.

Although our propaganda team has done some work over the past year, there is still a significant gap between our efforts and the Party and masses' requirements. In the future, we will strive to learn Mao Zedong Thought more diligently, enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and be lifelong red propaganda workers for Chairman Mao.

    做一辈子毛主席的红色宣传员
    北京市工代会宣武区副食品管理处毛泽东思想宣传队
    我们宣武区副食品管理处毛泽东思想宣传队，在毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的指引下，在无产阶级文化大革命的激烈的阶级斗争的大风大浪中，冲破资产阶级反动路线，杀出来了。我们和广大的无产阶级革命派一起怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，发扬了“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的大无畏精神，造了党内一小撮最大的走资派的反，造了本单位党内走资派的反，杀上了革命的文艺舞台，用文艺形式大力宣传毛泽东思想。通过一年多来的宣传实践活动，使我们深深懂得了文艺是阶级斗争的有力武器，我们工农兵一定要牢牢掌握这个武器，用好这个武器。我们这个宣传队的队员，有售货员、业务员、汽车司机、会计和干部。我们过去大都不会唱也不会跳，但是有了无限忠于毛主席的红心，我们就能够排除万难，边学习，边演出，边提高。这里着重谈谈我们活学活用毛主席著作，狠斗“私”字，搞好思想革命化，坚持业余宣传的一些体会。
    我们要宣传好伟大的毛泽东思想，就必须活学活用毛主席著作，不断改造世界观，提高无产阶级的政治觉悟。我们宣传队的队员来自四面八方，经常会产生各种各样的活思想。有了思想问题怎么办？开始我们也有不正确的想法，开展思想斗争怕闹意见，怕影响演出。毛主席教导我们说：“我们主张积极的思想斗争，因为它是达到党内和革命团体内的团结使之利于战斗的武器。每个共产党员和革命分子，应该拿起这个武器。”通过学习，我们认识到掩盖矛盾是错误的。后来我们就加强了思想政治工作，经常开学习会、谈心会，还进行家庭访问，人人都做思想政治工作，不断地纠正了个人名利思想和风头主义的思想。有的队员争角色，愿演甲角，不愿演乙角，愿演个人节目，如喜欢演独唱的节目。我们针对这种情况组织大家学习“老三篇”，用毛主席的教导来检查自己。通过学习座谈，有的队员说：“过去自己争角色，争演出次数多少，这是个人主义思想在作怪，这不符合毛泽东思想，演什么节目都是宣传毛泽东思想，今后分配什么角色，就演什么角色。”
    此外，队员所在单位和家庭有些问题处理不好，也会影响队员的情绪，如有的队员所在单位个别人认为队员出去演出是玩玩跳跳，有时外出演出，在工作班次安排上也遇到困难。根据这些情况，我们就到这些单位去做思想工作，介绍宣传队的情况，征求他们的意见。通过一系列工作，有的单位由不支持变为支持，还主动地安排时间让宣传队去宣传毛泽东思想。另外，队员们由于排练演出，晚上回家比较晚，确实给家里带来困难，于是，我们便到队员家庭进行访问，征求意见，通过访问做思想工作，得到家庭成员的大力支持。
    我们是一支业余的文艺宣传队伍，队员来自基层单位，我们必须牢牢地扎根在基层，扎根在群众之中，永远和群众生活、战斗在一起，决不能离开生产岗位。我们不仅不应该因为宣传影响工作，而且还应该积极贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的号召。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们宣传队的同志都积极参加了本单位的运动，有的还是革命群众组织的勤务员，和同志们一起闹革命，开展革命的大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改；在工作和生产上，我们坚守岗位，站柜台，搞生产，为人民服务。我们白天站柜台售货、在车间生产、开汽车、理发，晚上集中一起宣传毛泽东思想，不管晚上回来早晚，次日都坚持抓革命促生产。比如我们到较远的地区宣传演出，每次回来时都快到夜间十二点，队员们回家休息就要一点多钟，但第二天队员们还是和革命职工一样站柜台，搞生产。事实证明，这样做的结果，不仅得到了本系统领导和群众的好评，而且也便于长期坚持宣传活动。我们到基层商店演出也时刻不忘我们是一个劳动者。比如有一天晚上在西河沿菜市场演出，当时来了两汽车白菜，我们就暂时停止演出，和革命职工一起卸白菜，卸完了白菜又继续演出，受到了大家的热烈欢迎。我们在演出过程中，时时想到毛主席的教导，处处以解放军同志为榜样，以实际行动宣传毛泽东思想。一年来，除个别特殊情况占用一些工作时间外，我们都是坚持业余宣传。
    我们的宣传队一年多来虽然做了一些工作，但是离党和群众对我们的要求还有很大差距。今后我们要更加不断努力学习毛泽东思想，热情宣传毛泽东思想，做一辈子毛主席的红色宣传员。
