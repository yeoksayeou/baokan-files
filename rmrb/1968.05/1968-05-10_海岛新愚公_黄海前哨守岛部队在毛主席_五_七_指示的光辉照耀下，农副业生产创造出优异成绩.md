Chairman Mao, in his brilliant "May 7th Directive," said: "The People's Liberation Army should be a great school. This great school should study politics, study military affairs, study culture, and also engage in agricultural and sideline production..."

The troops guarding the frontline islands in the Yellow Sea resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, fearing neither hardships nor difficulties. On the rocky islands, they break rocks and level the land to create fields.

In their struggle against nature, they strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, continuously carrying out the revolutionization of people's thinking. The once desolate islands are being transformed into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought by the island-defending soldiers who are absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao. (Accompanying photograph)

Old soldiers who participated in the production in Nanyuan, during a break from land reclamation work, discuss with the soldiers the victory of Chairman Mao's military thought and the great significance of Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive."

Breaking rocks to create fields like Yu Gong, they grow large pumpkins in the cracks between the rocks; they offer them to Chairman Mao, asking him to taste the island's fruits. Soldiers in the fields select the pumpkins they have personally cultivated.

The accompanying photographs were taken by a reporter from this newspaper.

During their land reclamation work, the island-defending soldiers often study Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind, carrying out self-criticism and criticizing revisionism, and revolutionizing their thinking. This is them using their rest time to seriously study Chairman Mao's works.

With red hearts, strong bones, and firm will, they vow to turn the cliffs into Dazhai fields. The island-defending soldiers have broken rocks to create over 130 fields on the cliffs. This is a corner of the terraced fields they have reclaimed.

Heroic soldiers dare to fight against the heavens, building ponds to store water and prevent droughts. The island-defending soldiers have built water storage ponds on every step, path, and beside every field, collecting rainwater and washing water to irrigate the vegetable fields.

　　海岛新愚公
　　——黄海前哨守岛部队在毛主席“五·七”指示的光辉照耀下，农副业生产创造出优异成绩
    毛主席在光辉的“五·七”指示中说：“人民解放军应该是一个大学校。这个大学校，要学政治，学军事，学文化，又能从事农副业生产，……”
    黄海前哨守岛部队坚决遵循毛主席的教导，不畏艰险，不怕困难，在尽是岩石的海岛上开山劈石，移土造田。
    他们在同大自然搏斗的过程中，努力活学活用毛主席著作，不断地搞好人的思想革命化。昔日荒凉的海岛，正在被无限忠于毛主席的守岛部队指战员们办成毛泽东思想大学校。（附图片）
　　曾参加过南泥湾生产的老战士，在开荒劳动休息时，和战士们一起畅谈毛主席的建军思想的胜利和毛主席“五·七”指示的伟大意义。
　　劈石造田学愚公，石缝里结满了大南瓜；献给领袖毛主席，请他老人家尝尝岛上的瓜。战士们在地里挑选亲手培育的南瓜。

　　守岛战士们在开荒劳动中，经常带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，通过斗私批修，搞好人的思想革命化。这是他们利用休息时间在认真学习毛主席著作。
　　心红骨硬斗志坚，誓把悬崖绝壁变成大寨田。守岛战士在悬崖绝壁上劈山造田一百三十多块。这是开垦出来的梯田一角。
　　英雄战士敢斗天，修池积水防干旱。守岛战士在每个台阶、道旁、地旁都修了积水池，将雨水和洗手水收集起来，用来浇灌菜地。
