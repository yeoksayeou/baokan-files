Recently, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique has again grossly distorted Lenin's theory of proletarian revolution. In an article titled "Lenin's Military Theoretical Heritage and the Present Era" published in the Soviet revisionist *Military History Journal*, they absurdly claim that in the "present era," from an "objective historical viewpoint," the oppressed peoples of the world can "achieve socialist revolution" and "overthrow the reactionary rule of the imperialists" under the so-called "conditions of maintaining peace" through various forms of class struggle. To peddle this fallacy, they shamelessly say that in the current situation, war will result in the "death of millions of people and large-scale destruction of production," to oppose revolutionary war, and attempt to prevent the oppressed peoples from rising up in revolution.

The so-called "achieving socialist revolution under the conditions of maintaining peace" is nothing but the counter-revolutionary trash of Khrushchev's "peaceful transition."

The great Lenin has long clearly pointed out: "The idea that it is possible to make the capitalists surrender to the will of the majority of the exploited, to pass over to socialism by peaceful, reformist methods, is not only an extreme example of petty-bourgeois stupidity but also an outright deception of the workers, a whitewashing of capitalist wage slavery, and a concealment of the truth."

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In class society, revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable; without them, it is impossible to accomplish the leap in social development, to overthrow the reactionary ruling class, and to enable the people to seize power." The history of class struggle has long proven that the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the oppressed class and the oppressing class, and between the peoples of colonial and semi-colonial countries and imperialism, has always been a life-and-death class struggle. No reactionary ruling class has ever maintained "peace" with the laboring people, nor has any oppressed nation or oppressed class ever achieved true revolution under the so-called "conditions of peace."

Violent revolution is the universal law of proletarian revolution, as Lenin said, it is the "foundation of the entire doctrine of Marx and Engels." Revolution is violence; its central task and highest form is the armed seizure of power, the resolution of problems through war. All old societies and old systems will not collapse on their own. The reactionary ruling class always relies on the counter-revolutionary violence it controls to tenaciously maintain its tottering rule, always using bayonets and chains, gallows, and guillotines to suppress the proletariat and revolutionary people. The oppressed peoples and nations of the world must mobilize, organize, and arm themselves, using revolutionary violence to defeat counter-revolutionary violence, to smash the shackles on their own bodies, and to achieve true revolution. Recently, the death of the American non-violent activist Martin Luther King at the hands of U.S. imperialist counter-revolutionary violence has given the Soviet revisionist renegade clique a resounding slap in the face. This incident tells the people of the world that talk of "achieving revolution under conditions of maintaining peace" and "non-violence" is all nonsense. The Soviet revisionist renegade clique's so-called "revolution under conditions of maintaining peace" is essentially to make the oppressed nations and peoples endure the exploitation, oppression, and suppression of imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, not to rise up in revolution, and to maintain the "peace" of being oppressed. The Soviet revisionist renegade clique attempts to use the so-called "destruction" of war to intimidate the oppressed peoples of the world and prevent them from rising up in revolution, fully exposing their philosophy of sheer betrayal and the face of imperialist accomplices.

So, in the "present era," has the nature of imperialist aggression changed? How can the "reactionary rule of the imperialists" be "overthrown"?

The peoples of various countries who suffer from imperialist aggression and invasion have the best right to answer these questions. In the "present era," isn't U.S. imperialism still invading Vietnam? Isn't U.S. imperialism still expanding its military and continuing to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries? U.S. imperialism has played the role of the world's policeman, suppressing revolutions everywhere, directly and indirectly massacring the peoples of various countries. In today's world, is there any act of aggression and war that is not related to U.S. imperialism? The Soviet revisionist renegade clique does not mention the bloody reality of imperialist brutal suppression of national liberation movements and revolutionary movements of the peoples of various countries, but instead talks about "overthrowing the reactionary rule of the imperialists." This is not only extremely hypocritical but also extremely reactionary!

The people of the world see clearly: it is precisely the Soviet revisionist renegade clique that spreads such fallacies, shamelessly colluding with U.S. imperialism, and madly engaging in anti-communist, anti-Chinese, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary activities. It is the Soviet revisionist renegade clique that, under the pretext of "maintaining peace," helps U.S. neo-colonialism bloodily suppress the national liberation movement in the Congo (Kinshasa) and extinguish the flames of the Arab people's anti-aggression struggle. It is also this Soviet revisionist renegade clique that, under the cover of "maintaining peace," repeatedly plays the "peace talks" trick, attempting to strangle the great struggle of the Vietnamese people to resist U.S. aggression and save the nation. The Soviet revisionist renegade clique shamelessly serves the U.S. imperialist "global strategy," acting as the number one accomplice of the U.S. imperialists, and doing all sorts of evil deeds. No matter how many times they shout the slogan of "overthrowing the reactionary rule of the imperialists," they can never cover up their heinous crimes of counter-revolution and anti-people.

The Soviet revisionist renegade clique, on the one hand, distorts Lenin's theory of violent revolution, and on the other hand, deceives and propagates that in their "military science," they have "preserved the general theoretical foundation of Lenin" and "enriched and supplemented these foundations with new ideas, new points, and new conclusions," and so on. This is a great insult to the great Lenin, a great insult to the October Revolution.

The Soviet revisionist renegade clique attempts to use the despicable method of castrating and falsifying the great Lenin's military theory to prevent the broad masses of revolutionary people from rising up in rebellion and to serve U.S. imperialism and maintain their own tottering "throne," which will not succeed. The revolutionary peoples of all countries will surely raise high the revolutionary banner of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" and march forward bravely!

### 不许苏修歪曲列宁的暴力革命学说

    不许苏修歪曲列宁的暴力革命学说
    装甲兵机关无产阶级革命派
    最近，苏修叛徒集团又大肆歪曲列宁的无产阶级革命学说。在苏修《军事历史杂志》发表的一篇题为《列宁的军事理论遗产和现时代》的文章，胡说什么：在“现时代”，“从客观历史观点来看”，世界被压迫人民在所谓“保持和平的条件下”可以通过各种形式的阶级斗争来“实现社会主义革命”和“推翻帝国主义者的反动统治”。为了贩卖这套谬论，他们还无耻地说什么在目前情况下，战争会导致“千百万人的死亡、生产的大规模破坏”，来反对革命战争，妄图阻止被压迫人民起来革命。
    所谓在“保持和平的条件下”，“实现社会主义革命”，就是赫鲁晓夫的“和平过渡”的反革命破烂货。
    伟大的列宁早已明确指出：“凡是以为可以用和平方式使资本家服从大多数被剥削者意志，可以通过和平的、改良主义的道路过渡到社会主义的设想，都不仅是极端的市侩的愚蠢行为，而且是对工人的公然的欺骗，对资本主义的雇佣奴役制的粉饰和对真理的隐瞒。”
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“在阶级社会中，革命和革命战争是不可避免的，舍此不能完成社会发展的飞跃，不能推翻反动的统治阶级，而使人民获得政权。”阶级斗争的历史早已雄辩地证明，无产阶级同资产阶级之间的斗争，被压迫阶级同压迫阶级之间的斗争，殖民地半殖民地人民同帝国主义之间的斗争，从来就是你死我活的阶级斗争。没有一个反动统治阶级能对劳动人民“保持和平”，也没有一个被压迫民族和被压迫阶级能在所谓“和平条件”下实现真正的革命。
    暴力革命，是无产阶级革命的普遍规律，正如列宁所说，是“马克思和恩格斯全部学说的基础”。革命就是暴力，它的中心任务和最高形式就是武装夺取政权，就是战争解决问题。一切旧社会和旧制度是不会自行崩溃的。反动的统治阶级总是靠它掌握的反革命暴力，顽强地维持他们摇摇欲坠的统治，总是用刺刀和镣铐，绞刑架和断头台来镇压无产阶级和革命人民。世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族只有动员起来，组织起来，武装起来，用革命的暴力去战胜反革命的暴力，才能粉碎自己身上的枷锁，实现真正的革命。最近，美国非暴力主义者马丁·路德·金死于美帝国主义反革命暴力之下，给了苏修叛徒集团一记最响亮的耳光。这件事告诉世界人民，什么“保持和平条件下”实现“革命”，什么“非暴力主义”，统统是骗人的鬼话。苏修叛徒集团的所谓“保持和平的条件下”的“革命”，实质上就是要被压迫民族和被压迫人民忍受帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的剥削、压迫和镇压，不要起来革命，保持被压迫的“和平”。苏修叛徒集团妄图利用所谓战争的“破坏”来恐吓世界被压迫人民，阻止他们起来革命，这充分暴露了他们地地道道的叛徒哲学和帝国主义帮凶者的嘴脸。
    那末，在“现时代”，帝国主义的侵略本性是否已经改变，究竟怎样才能“推翻帝国主义者的反动统治”呢？
    对于这些问题，遭受帝国主义压迫和侵略的各国人民最有权回答。在“现时代”，难道美帝国主义不是还在侵略越南吗？美帝国主义不是还在扩军备战、继续镇压世界各国人民的革命斗争吗？美帝国主义充当了世界宪兵的角色，到处镇压革命，直接和间接地屠杀各国人民。当今世界上有哪一桩侵略和战争的罪行，同美帝国主义没有关系？苏修叛徒集团闭口不谈帝国主义残酷镇压民族解放运动和各国人民革命运动的血淋淋的现实，却在侈谈什么“推翻帝国主义者的反动统治”。这不仅是虚伪透顶，而且是反动透顶！
    全世界人民看得很清楚：正是大发这种谬论的苏修叛徒集团，无耻地与美帝勾结，疯狂地进行反共、反华、反人民、反革命的勾当。正是苏修叛徒集团在“保持和平”的幌子下，帮助美国新殖民主义血腥地镇压刚果（金）的民族解放运动，扑灭阿拉伯人民反侵略斗争的烈火。也还是这个苏修叛徒集团，在“保持和平”的烟幕下，一次又一次地玩弄“和谈”骗局，妄图扼杀越南人民伟大的抗美救国斗争。苏修叛徒集团厚颜无耻地为美帝的反革命“全球战略”服务，充当了美帝的头号帮凶，干尽了坏事。不管他们怎样把“推翻帝国主义者的反动统治”的口号喊上千万遍，也绝对掩盖不了他们反革命、反人民的滔天罪行。
    苏修叛徒集团一面歪曲列宁的暴力革命学说，一面又欺骗宣传说什么在它们的“军事科学”中“保存了列宁的一般理论基础”，并用“新思想、新论点和新结论充实和丰富了这些基础”等等。这是对伟大列宁的莫大侮辱，对十月革命的莫大侮辱。
    苏修叛徒集团妄图用阉割和篡改伟大列宁军事学说的卑劣手法来阻止广大的革命人民起来造反，来为美帝效劳和维持自己的摇摇欲坠的“宝座”，这是决不能得逞的。世界各国革命人民必将高举“枪杆子里面出政权”的革命旗帜，奋勇前进！
