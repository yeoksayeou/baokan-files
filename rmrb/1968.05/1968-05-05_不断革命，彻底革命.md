Continuous Revolution, Thorough Revolution

Class enemies always use two counter-revolutionary tactics: political deception and fierce attacks. China's Khrushchev is exactly like this. On one hand, he spreads the idea that: "In our struggle against the bourgeoisie, will socialism ultimately triumph, or will capitalism? ... Agriculture has been collectivized, handicrafts have been collectivized, the outcome has been decided." He uses this to lull the revolutionary masses into complacency. On the other hand, he fiercely promotes capitalism and attacks socialism. During the period of agricultural collectivization, he severely cut down on cooperatives; after the establishment of people's communes, he vigorously advocated for "three autonomies and one contract," individual farming, and so on. Every step forward we take, every victory we achieve, he launches an attack. Each of our struggles with him is a matter of life and death for socialism. If we fall for China's Khrushchev's tricks and think that the outcome has been decided, and do not engage in a life-and-death struggle against the class enemy, the fruits of the socialist revolution are in constant danger of being lost. Only by following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings, continuously revolutionizing, thoroughly revolutionizing, and carrying the socialist revolution through to the end, can we continuously achieve victories and thoroughly defeat capitalism.

    不断革命，彻底革命
    阶级敌人总是惯用反革命的两手：一是政治欺骗，一是疯狂进攻。中国赫鲁晓夫就是这样。他一面散布什么：“我们跟资产阶级斗争，到底是社会主义胜利，还是资本主义胜利呢？……农业合作化了，手工业合作化了，胜负解决了。”用这个来麻痹革命群众的斗志。一方面他大刮资本主义黑风，向社会主义进攻。农业合作化时期，他大砍合作社；成立人民公社以后，他大肆鼓吹“三自一包”、单干。……我们每前进一步，每取得一个胜利，他就发动一次进攻。我们和他的每一次斗争，都是关系到社会主义胜负的问题。如果我们上了中国赫鲁晓夫的当，以为胜负问题解决了，不再和阶级敌人作针锋相对的斗争，社会主义革命的成果，时刻都有可能失去。只有遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，不断革命，彻底革命，把社会主义革命进行到底，才能不断取得胜利，彻底战胜资本主义。
