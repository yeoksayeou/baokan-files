The Soviet revisionist leadership recently sent a so-called "cultural delegation" composed of professors to Ecuador to conduct activities. During their stay, this "delegation" fraternized closely with local pro-American reactionaries and revisionists, sabotaging the local student movement and once again exposing the shameful face of the Soviet revisionist clique.

This "delegation" visited various major cities in Ecuador in March and April. Wherever they went, they were in close contact with local pro-American reactionaries, indulging in pleasure. However, these Soviet revisionists deliberately avoided contact with the working people of Ecuador. It was revealed that on March 30, several landlords invited these Soviet revisionists to Cuevas in the province of Los Ríos, treating them to a feast in their own estates. These Soviet revisionists were in high spirits, drinking and making merry. However, they kept their distance from the thousands of Ecuadorian peasants who were brutally exploited in these estates, not daring or willing to make contact with them. It was also revealed that these Soviet revisionists were invited to some lowly entertainment venues to mix around.

The Soviet "delegation" did everything in their power to slander and sabotage the local progressive students' struggle against American imperialism and its agents. On March 29, students in Guayaquil held an anti-American demonstration. The demonstrators shouted, "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Long live the revolution!" "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with the revisionist traitors!" According to an Ecuadorian journalist, these Soviet revisionists were still singing and dancing in a café when the demonstrators were being suppressed by reactionary military police. They also slandered, saying that the student demonstration "caused chaos."

On April 1, the Ecuadorian University Student Union held a 48-hour strike in the university city to protest the suppression of students in Quito by reactionary military police. However, the Soviet "delegation" attempted to hold a "report on the judicial situation in the Soviet Union" in the university city to sabotage the strike.

To spread revisionist poison and seek out and cultivate their agents among Ecuadorian intellectuals, the "delegation" publicly stated that they would provide tuition and travel expenses to allow Ecuadorian professors and students to "visit" and "study" in the Soviet Union.

The despicable actions of the Soviet "cultural delegation" in Ecuador have aroused the indignation of progressive people in Ecuador.

    苏修“代表团”的卑劣行径激起厄瓜多尔进步人士的愤慨
    新华社十四日讯　瓜亚基尔消息：苏修领导集团最近派出一个以教授组成的所谓“文化代表团”，到厄瓜多尔进行活动。这个“代表团”在活动期间，同当地亲美反动分子和修正主义分子打得火热，破坏当地的学生运动，再一次暴露了苏修叛徒集团的可耻嘴脸。
    这个“代表团”在三月和四月间曾“访问”了厄瓜多尔各主要城市，他们所到之处同当地亲美反动分子亲密无间，纵情玩乐。但这些苏修分子却竭力避免同厄瓜多尔劳动人民接触。据揭露，三月三十日，几个地主曾经邀请这些苏修分子到洛斯里奥斯省的克维多去，在自己的庄园里设宴招待他们，这些苏修分子兴高采烈，狂饮作乐。而对于在这些庄园里做工的遭受残酷剥削的成千名厄瓜多尔农民，这些苏修分子却远远避开，不敢也不愿意同他们接触。据揭露，这些苏修分子还应邀到一些下流的娱乐场所去鬼混。
    苏修“代表团”对当地进步学生反对美帝国主义及其代理人的斗争，竭尽其诽谤和破坏之能事。三月二十九日，瓜亚基尔学生举行了一次反美示威。示威学生高呼：“毛泽东万岁！”“革命万岁！”“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒修正主义叛徒！”据一名厄瓜多尔记者透露，这些苏修分子在示威学生遭到反动军警镇压的时候，依然在咖啡馆里唱歌跳舞。他们还诽谤说，学生示威“引起了混乱”。
    四月一日，厄瓜多尔大学生联合会为抗议反动军警对基多大学生的镇压，在大学城举行四十八小时罢课。而苏修“代表团”却企图在大学城举行“关于苏联司法情况的报告会”，破坏这次罢课。
    为了灌输修正主义毒素和在厄瓜多尔知识分子中寻找与培养其代理人，“代表团”公开表示要提供公费和旅费，以便让厄瓜多尔教授和学生到苏联“访问”和“学习”。
    苏修“文化代表团”在厄瓜多尔的卑劣行径，激起了厄瓜多尔进步人士的愤慨。
