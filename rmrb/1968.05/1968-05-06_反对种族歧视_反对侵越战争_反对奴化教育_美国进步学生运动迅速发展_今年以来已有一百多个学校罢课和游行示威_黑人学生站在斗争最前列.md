The progressive student movement in the United States has been rapidly developing recently. According to incomplete statistics, more than a hundred schools in the United States have seen strikes and demonstrations since the beginning of this year. Large numbers of black students, Mexican students, and white students have actively participated in the just struggles against racial discrimination, against the Vietnam War, against slave education, and against police brutality. Students have been closely united and full of fighting spirit, continuously pushing the struggle forward.

The surge in the progressive student movement in the United States is one of the signs of the accelerating awakening of the American people and youth. It is the result of the increasingly sharp contradictions between the broad laboring masses who are oppressed and exploited and the monopoly capitalist class. It is closely linked with the rapidly developing black anti-violence struggle and the American people's struggle against the Vietnam War.

In the American student movement, black students are at the forefront. They fight the most bravely and resolutely and have the closest ties with the black masses. Since last year, black students in the United States have engaged in many clashes with American fascist police. In early April this year, when the black people launched a large-scale anti-violence struggle, black students at Tennessee State University burned down a building used by the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps. The American *Vanguard* weekly recently said: "A new generation of black students is organizing for black power."

Black students are also fighting against slave education in schools. They not only demand curriculum reforms and the introduction of courses on black history, culture, literature, and art, but also demand a fundamental change in the direction of the schools. Many black students are currently striving to strengthen their ties with the broad black masses, going into the black communities near their schools to introduce the true history of blacks, establish anti-draft movement organizations, and so on.

To coordinate the struggle, black students in many universities are rapidly organizing under the slogan of "Black Power." Currently, black students in major cities such as New York, Washington, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Los Angeles are uniting.

In mid-March this year, more than 15,000 Mexican students in Los Angeles held a series of strikes lasting about half a month to protest against racial oppression and discrimination. This just struggle by Mexican students received strong support from black and white students in Los Angeles. Many black students immediately joined the strike. Many children of white workers also responded to the struggle of their Mexican and black brothers, holding mass meetings and issuing declarations, pointing out that the goals of black students, Mexican students, and white students are the same. The united struggle of students in Los Angeles has dealt a serious blow to the reactionary authorities. Although the American reactionaries sent out large numbers of police to brutally beat and arrest unarmed young people, this only made the fighting unity of students of all races in Los Angeles more solid.

Under the leadership of black students, the anti-draft struggle and other struggles for student rights by white students in the United States are also developing further. Since last year, in many famous universities such as Columbia University, the University of California, the University of Chicago, and the University of Michigan, there have been fierce struggles against the CIA recruiting spies among students, against the school administration signing contracts with the Department of Defense to serve American aggression policies, and against the "Dow Chemical Company" recruiting thugs to manufacture napalm. In the large demonstrations against the Vietnam War at the end of April, dozens of universities held strikes, and many schools saw students occupying school buildings. More and more white students not only oppose the draft but also oppose racial discrimination and support the black anti-violence struggle. The struggle at Columbia University at the end of April, in which black and white students jointly participated to oppose the Vietnam War, racial discrimination, and police brutality, is a prominent example.

As the struggle develops, more and more progressive students are beginning to realize that the broad student masses and workers in the United States face a common enemy and have common interests. Therefore, they are going deep into the worker masses, participating in workers' strikes, and actively promoting the combination of the student movement and the worker movement.

The great leader of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, teaches: "Youth is the most active and vigorous part of the entire social force." The rapid development of the youth student movement in the United States will further promote the struggle of the entire American people against the brutal rule of the American monopoly capitalist class and hasten the arrival of a new storm of revolutionary struggle among the American people.

　　反对种族歧视　反对侵越战争　反对奴化教育
　　美国进步学生运动迅速发展
　　今年以来已有一百多个学校罢课和游行示威　黑人学生站在斗争最前列
    据新华社五日讯　本社记者报道：最近一个时期以来，美国的进步学生运动迅速高涨起来。据不完全的统计，今年来美国已有一百多个学校爆发了罢课和游行示威。大批的黑人学生、墨西哥族学生和白人学生积极参加反对种族歧视、反对侵越战争、反对奴化教育和反对警察暴行的正义斗争。学生们在斗争中紧密团结，斗志昂扬，不断把斗争推向前进。
    美国进步学生运动的高涨，是美国人民和青年加速觉醒的标志之一，是美国被压迫被剥削的广大劳动人民同垄断资产阶级的矛盾日益尖锐化的结果，它同迅速发展着的黑人抗暴斗争和美国人民反对侵越战争的斗争紧密地联系在一起。
    在美国学生运动中，走在最前列的是黑人学生，他们斗争最英勇、最坚决，和黑人群众的联系也最密切。从去年开始，美国黑人学生就曾同美国法西斯军警进行过多次搏斗。今年四月初美国黑人掀起大规模抗暴斗争的时候，田纳西州立大学的黑人学生还把校园里的空军后备军官训练队的一个建筑物放火烧掉。美国《前卫》周报不久前说：“一代新的黑人学生，正在为黑人权力而组织起来。”
    黑人学生们还在学校中为反对奴化教育而斗争着。他们不仅要求进行课程改革，要求开设黑人的历史、文化、文学和艺术的课程，而且要求从根本上改变学校的方向。许多黑人学生目前正努力加强同广大黑人群众的联系，深入到学校附近的黑人区群众中去，向群众介绍黑人的真实历史，建立反征兵运动的组织等。
    为了协调斗争，在许多大学中，黑人学生正在黑人要权力的口号下，进一步迅速地组织起来。目前纽约、华盛顿、费城、亚特兰大、洛杉矶等大城市的黑人学生正在联合起来。
    今年三月中旬，美国洛杉矶市一万五千余名墨西哥族中学生接连举行了约半个月的大罢课，反对种族压迫和种族歧视。墨西哥族学生的这一正义斗争得到了洛杉矶市黑人学生和白人学生的大力支持，当地的许多黑人中学生立即参加了罢课。许多白人工人的子弟也起来响应墨西哥族和黑人兄弟的斗争，纷纷召开群众大会，发表宣言，指出黑人学生、墨西哥族学生和白人学生的目标是共同的。洛杉矶市学生的联合斗争给了反动当局以严重打击。尽管美国反动派出动了大批警察，疯狂地殴打并大批逮捕手无寸铁的青少年，但是这使得洛杉矶市各族学生的战斗团结发展得更加巩固。
    在黑人学生的带动下，美国白人学生的反征兵斗争和其他争取学生权利的斗争，也正在进一步发展。去年以来，在美国的许多有名的大学如哥伦比亚大学、加利福尼亚大学、芝加哥大学、密执安大学等学校里，都爆发过学生反对中央情报局在大学生中招募特务、反对校方与国防部签订合同为美国的侵略政策效劳、反对制造凝固汽油弹的“道氏化学公司”到学校招募帮凶等激烈的斗争。在今年四月底的反对侵越战争的大示威中，有几十个大学举行了罢课，许多学校发生了学生占领学校大楼的事件。越来越多的白人学生不仅反对征兵，而且反对种族歧视，支持黑人的抗暴斗争。在四月底爆发的哥伦比亚大学黑人学生和白人学生共同参加的反对侵越战争、反对种族歧视、反对警察暴行的斗争，便是一个突出的例子。
    随着斗争的发展，越来越多的进步学生开始认识到，美国广大的学生群众和工人面临着共同的敌人，有着共同的利益。因此，他们正深入到工人群众中去，参加工人的罢工斗争，积极促进学生运动和工人运动的相结合。
    无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席教导说：“青年是整个社会力量中的一部分最积极最有生气的力量。”美国青年学生运动的迅速发展，必将进一步推动整个美国人民反对美国垄断资产阶级残暴统治的斗争，促进美国人民革命斗争新风暴的到来。
