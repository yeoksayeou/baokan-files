The Revolutionary Committee of the Guizhou Coal Mine, since its establishment in January this year, has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, leading the broad revolutionary masses of workers to intensify class struggle. They have smashed the counterattacks of a handful of unrepentant capitalist roaders, exposed the bad elements disguised within the revolutionary ranks, purified the revolutionary ranks, and further consolidated and developed the revolutionary three-in-one combination and the great alliance of revolution. The revolutionary criticism movement has been carried out vigorously, and the authority of the proletarian Revolutionary Committee has been increasingly enhanced. The revolutionary and production situation in the entire mine has become better and better. Following the completion of the first quarter's coal production plan eight days ahead of schedule, the mine, on the eve of the May Day International Labor Day, once again completed the April coal production task 11 days ahead of schedule, becoming an advanced unit in the coal industry of Guizhou Province for "grasping revolution and promoting production."

　　狠抓阶级斗争，纯洁革命队伍
　　贵阳煤矿四月提前十一天完成计划
    贵阳煤矿革命委员会在今年一月成立以后，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，带领广大革命职工，狠抓阶级斗争，粉碎了一小撮不甘心灭亡的走资派的反扑，揪出了乔装打扮混在革命队伍里的坏人，纯洁了革命队伍，进一步巩固和发展了革命三结合和革命大联合。革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈，革命委员会的无产阶级权威日益提高，全矿革命和生产形势越来越好。全矿继第一季度提前八天完成原煤生产计划之后，“五一”国际劳动节前夕，又提前十一天完成了四月份原煤生产任务，成为贵州省煤炭战线“抓革命，促生产”的先进单位。
