The revolutionary people of Ceylon held a grand parade and rally in Colombo on May 1 to celebrate May Day. They chanted slogans hailing Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

A report from the Xinhua News Agency in Colombo said that the Ceylon Communist Party, the Ceylon Federation of Labor, the All-Ceylon Peasants' Council, and the Ceylon Youth League jointly organized a grand parade and rally with 3,000 participants.

The parade was led by a giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao and a banner reading "Long Live the Greatest Marxist-Leninist of the Contemporary Era, Comrade Mao Zedong!"

Many participants wore Chairman Mao badges, held up portraits of Chairman Mao, red flags, and placards with quotations from Chairman Mao. Under the scorching sun, the parade participants marched forward with high spirits, chanting slogans such as "Workers of the world, unite!," "Fully support the Vietnamese people in their heroic struggle for liberation!," "Fully support the struggle of American blacks against racial discrimination!," "Down with U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries!," "Down with modern revisionism!," "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!," "Long live the greatest Marxist-Leninist of the contemporary era, Comrade Mao Zedong!," and "Long live Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!"

After the parade, a rally was held.

In a recorded speech, Comrade Samugadasan called on the people to seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings on armed seizure of power. He also called on progressive forces to unite and eliminate all reactionary forces. Member of Parliament S. D. Bandaranayake said in his speech that oppressed nations and peoples around the world should unite under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, take up arms, and fight against imperialism and all reactionaries to achieve independence and liberation.
