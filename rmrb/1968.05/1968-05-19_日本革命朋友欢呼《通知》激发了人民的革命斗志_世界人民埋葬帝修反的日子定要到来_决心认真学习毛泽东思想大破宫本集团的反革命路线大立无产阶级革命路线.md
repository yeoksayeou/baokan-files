Japanese revolutionary friends hail the "Notice," inspiring the people's revolutionary spirit
The day of the world's people burying imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries is sure to come
Determined to seriously study Mao Zedong Thought, smash the reactionary line of the Gombun group, and establish the proletarian revolutionary line

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 18th, according to a report from Dongfang News Agency: On the second anniversary of the publication of the "Notice" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on May 16, 1966, revolutionary leftists from various parts of Japan spoke to Dongfang News Agency reporters, enthusiastically hailing this great, epoch-making document.

	The leftist faction of the Fukushima Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, Takeo Sawada, said: The "Notice" sounded the charge for the advance of the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. The Cultural Revolution, this great mass movement, has dealt a heavy blow to the Chinese Khrushchev and all revisionists in the world, including the head of the Soviet modern revisionist group, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the Japanese Communist Party revisionist elements, Kyuji Miyamoto. Japanese revolutionary workers and students have been greatly inspired by the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win of the revolutionary faction of the Chinese proletariat and the Red Guards, launching a fierce attack on the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the Japanese Communist Party revisionist elements.

	Sawada pointed out that the Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat has made socialist China even stronger. Now, China has become the most reliable and strong revolutionary base for the revolutionary people of the whole world.

	The leftist faction of Ibaraki Prefecture, Masayuki Iijima, in his speech, enthusiastically hailed that Marxism-Leninism has developed to the new stage of Mao Zedong Thought. He said: Chairman Mao summed up the lessons of the modern revisionist groups in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries seizing the leadership and restoring capitalism, and expounded that the class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat is still concentrated on the issue of power.

	Another leftist faction of Ibaraki Prefecture, Katsuo Kobayashi, pointed out that Chairman Mao is the Lenin of our time. The world has entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. He said that the "Notice" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has great historical significance. This brilliant document has inspired the revolutionary spirit of the Japanese people and the people of the whole world, encouraging them to fight to overthrow the rule of imperialism and reactionaries.

	The leftist faction of Aomori Prefecture, Hiroshi Nakajima, said that just when the Soviet Union and some countries were carrying out the restoration of capitalism, Chairman Mao mobilized the broad masses of the people to launch the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, not only preventing the restoration of capitalism in China but also this revolution has great guiding significance for the proletarian revolution of the whole world. He said: The victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Under the inspiration of the victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in China, the revolutionary people of the whole world are launching a large-scale revolutionary struggle. They will bury the day of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

	The preparatory committee of the leftist faction of the Kanagawa Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, Akira Kawada, said: The "Notice" personally presided over by Chairman Mao is a great Marxist-Leninist document. The great victory of the Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat is a great support and encouragement to the revolutionary people of Japan.

	Kawada pointed out: Chairman Mao teaches us, "Without destruction, there can be no construction." In Japan, without destroying the reactionary line of the Miyamoto revisionist group of the Japanese Communist Party, it is not possible to establish the proletarian revolutionary line. He said: At present, while we are fighting against American imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital, we must also carry out a thorough criticism and struggle against the Miyamoto revisionist group that controls the central committee of the Japanese Communist Party.

	Ichiro Hashimoto of the leftist faction of the Kamifukuda Branch of the Saitama Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party said: Supporting or opposing the Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat is the dividing line between true communists and false communists. Learning the highest level of Marxism-Leninism of the contemporary era—Mao Zedong Thought, arming ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and daring to fight against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries is our important task.

	Miyuki Honda of the leftist faction of the Kamifukuda Town Branch of the Saitama Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party said: The great document "Notice" inspires us to smash the revisionist line of the Miyamoto revisionist group of the Japanese Communist Party. Chairman Mao teaches us, "Without destruction, there can be no construction." We are determined to seriously study Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly smash the reactionary parliamentary line of the Miyamoto revisionist group.

    日本革命朋友欢呼《通知》激发了人民的革命斗志
    世界人民埋葬帝修反的日子定要到来
    决心认真学习毛泽东思想大破宫本集团的反革命路线大立无产阶级革命路线
    据新华社十八日讯　据东方通讯社报道：在中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》发表两周年的时候，日本各地的革命左派向东方社记者发表谈话，热烈欢呼这个伟大的划时代文献。
    日本共产党福岛县委员会（左派）的泽田武说：《通知》吹响了中国无产阶级文化大革命进军的号角。文化大革命，这个伟大的群众运动给中国赫鲁晓夫以及包括苏联现代修正主义集团的头子勃列日涅夫、柯西金，日共修正主义分子宫本显治等在内的全世界一切修正主义分子以沉重的打击。日本革命工人和青年学生，从中国无产阶级革命派和红卫兵的敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神中，受到巨大的鼓舞，向着美日反动派和日共修正主义分子发动了猛烈的进攻。
    泽田指出，中国的无产阶级文化大革命使社会主义的中国更加强大了。现在，中国已成为全世界革命人民最可靠的坚强的革命根据地。
    茨城县的革命左派饭岛政雪在谈话中热烈欢呼马克思列宁主义已经发展到了毛泽东思想的崭新阶段。他说：毛主席总结了现代修正主义集团在苏联等社会主义国家篡夺领导权和复辟资本主义的教训，阐明了无产阶级专政下的阶级斗争仍然集中在政权问题上。
    另一位茨城县的革命左派小林克男指出，毛主席是当代的列宁。世界已进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。他说，中国共产党中央委员会的《通知》具有伟大的历史意义。这个光辉的文件鼓舞了日本人民和全世界人民的革命斗志，激励他们奋起为推翻帝国主义和反动派的统治而斗争。
    櫔木县革命左派中岛彪三说，正当苏联和一些国家实行资本主义复辟的时候，毛泽东主席动员广大人民群众，发动无产阶级文化大革命，不仅防止了资本主义在中国的复辟，而且这场革命对全世界无产阶级革命具有巨大的指导意义。他又说：无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。在中国无产阶级文化大革命胜利的鼓舞下，全世界革命人民，正在大规模的展开革命斗争，他们在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想指引下，埋葬帝、修、反的日子一定要到来的。
    日本共产党神奈川县委员会（左派）筹备委员会的河田明说：毛主席亲自主持制定的这个《通知》是一部伟大的马克思列宁主义文献。中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是对日本革命人民极大的支持和鼓舞。
    河田指出：毛主席教导我们说，“不破不立”。在日本，不破除日共宫本修正主义集团的反革命路线，就不能建立起无产阶级革命路线。他说：当前，我们同美帝国主义和日本垄断资本进行斗争的同时，必须对控制了日共中央的大党阀宫本修正主义集团进行彻底的批判和斗争。
    日本共产党埼玉县上福冈支部（左派）的桥本一郎说：支持中国无产阶级文化大革命还是反对中国无产阶级文化大革命，这是区分真正共产主义者还是假共产主义者的分水岭。学习当代最高水平的马列主义——毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装自己，敢于同帝、修、反进行斗争，是我们的重要任务。
    属于日本共产党埼玉县上福同町支部（左派）的本田美纬说：《通知》这个伟大文献，鼓舞我们造日共宫本修正主义集团的反。毛主席教导我们，“不破不立”。我们决心认真学习毛泽东思想，彻底粉碎宫本修正主义集团的反革命议会主义路线。
