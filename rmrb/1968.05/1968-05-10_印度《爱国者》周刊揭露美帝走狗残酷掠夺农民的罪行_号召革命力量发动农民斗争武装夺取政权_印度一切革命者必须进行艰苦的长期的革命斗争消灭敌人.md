New Delhi, May 6 (Xinhua) – The Bengali-language weekly "Patriot" recently published an article exposing the crimes of the U.S. imperialist running dogs—Indian feudal landlords, usurers, and hoarders—in ruthlessly plundering Indian peasants. The article calls on Indian revolutionary forces to vigorously launch peasant struggles, encircle cities from the countryside, and seize power through armed struggle.

The article, titled "India's Food Problem and Its Solution," states that the root cause of India's severe food crisis is land concentration, usury, and commercial hoarding.

The article points out that most of India's land is concentrated in the hands of a few large landlords. Out of India's 400 million peasants, 150 million have no land at all and work as day laborers on landlords' fields. Their plight is as miserable as that of slaves. They go hungry or half-starved for about eight months a year, subsisting on tree roots and leaves. Another 150 million peasants either have only a few acres of land each or are sharecroppers. They are so poor that they cannot afford fertilizers, irrigation, pesticides, or even seeds to increase production. To repay debts, they even mortgage their land and homes to usurers. At planting time, they borrow money from usurers, pledging their land as collateral, and at harvest time, they repay double or even triple the amount (in some places, two to three times). According to official figures, India's usury loans amount to 30 billion rupees annually. Thus, large landlords and usurers not only seize half of the rice produced by tens of millions of peasants but also use 30 billion rupees in loans to control 300 million peasants. They further hoard large quantities of rice at harvest time, then create artificial famines, selling the rice at five to ten times the original price, plundering tens of millions of rupees.

The article points out that U.S. imperialism is the main supporter of Indian large landlords, usurers, and profiteers, and that Indian large landlords, usurers, and profiteers are the main social base for U.S. rule in India. The article states that Indian large landlords, usurers, and hoarders, in order to seize profits and maintain landlord ownership, demand U.S. protection. The U.S. also protects them to perpetuate India's famine and maintain India's dependence on U.S. grain. The article states that the U.S. and its running dogs—industrialists like Tata and Birla in cities, and landlords, usurers, and hoarders in the countryside—cruelly exploit India, causing 100 to 150 million people to starve to death each year. The article angrily declares, "The American devils have sucked our blood dry!"

The article emphasizes that to solve the famine problem, U.S. imperialism must be driven out. It states that to break free from the control of these devils, the first step is to overthrow the U.S. running dogs—landlords, usurers, and profiteers—in the countryside. Peasants must, under the leadership of the working class, launch land seizure struggles and establish rural revolutionary bases.

The article states that imperialism is like a large elephant, with the city as its power center—the head. It says not to attack it from the city first. Instead, attack it from the rear, from the countryside, where it is weak. With blow after blow, its hind legs will eventually be broken. After occupying the countryside and encircling the cities, then strike its head fiercely.

The article states that India's countryside is home to about 400 million peasants, who suffer the most oppression and exploitation and harbor the deepest hatred for the enemy. They will fight desperately and for the long term until they break the elephant's head.

The article concludes that all Indian revolutionaries must engage in arduous, long-term revolutionary struggles to annihilate the enemy.

    新华社六日讯　新德里消息：印度孟加拉文《爱国者》周刊不久以前发表文章，揭露美帝国主义的走狗印度封建地主、高利贷者和囤积者残酷掠夺印度农民的罪行，号召印度革命力量大力发动农民斗争，以农村包围城市，武装夺取政权。
    这篇题为《印度的粮食问题及其解决途径》的文章说，造成印度严重粮食危机的原因是：土地集中、高利贷和商人囤积。
    文章指出，印度大部分土地都集中在大地主手中。而四亿农民中有一亿五千万农民完全没有土地，靠在地主的土地上做日工。他们的处境和奴隶一样悲惨。他们每年约有八个月的时间是饿着或半饿着，吃树根树叶度日。另外的一亿五千万农民中，有的每户只有三、五（印）亩地，有的是分益佃农。他们穷到不仅谈不上用肥料、灌溉、农药等来增产，而且种子都吃光了。为了还债甚至连土地、房基都抵押给高利贷者。播种时要向高利贷者借钱，借钱的条件是以土地作押，割稻时还一倍半（某些地方是两三倍）。据官方数字，印度的高利贷贷款每年是三百亿卢比。这样，大地主、高利贷者除了把千千万万农民所生产的一半稻谷放入了自己的仓库之外，还用三百亿卢比贷款卡着三亿农民的脖子，他们每年至少把一千五百亿卢比的稻谷放入自己仓库。收割时又囤积了大量的稻谷，然后制造人为的饥荒，以五、六倍至十倍的高价卖出，掠取数以千万计的卢比。
    文章指出，美帝国主义是印度大地主、高利贷者和奸商的主要支持者，而印度大地主、高利贷者和奸商是美帝统治印度的主要社会基础。文章说，印度的大地主、高利贷者和囤积者为了攫取利润和保持地主所有制，要求美帝保护，而美帝也尽力保护他们，以永远保持印度的饥荒，保持印度对美粮的依赖。文章说，美帝和它的走狗——在城市是塔塔、比拉们，在农村是地主、高利贷者及囤积者——残酷的剥削，使印度每年仅仅饿死的就有一百至一百五十万。文章愤怒地说：“美国佬吸尽了我们的血！”
    文章强调指出：美帝国主义为了自己的利益，通过印度在农村的魔鬼制造饥荒，要以饥饿来毁灭印度整个民族，不赶走它就解决不了饥荒问题。文章说，要摆脱这些魔鬼的控制，首先要在农村推翻美帝的走狗——地主、高利贷者及奸商。农民们必须在工人阶级领导下，展开夺地斗争，进而建立农村革命根据地。
    文章说，帝国主义象一头大象，城市是它的力量中心——脑袋。不要先从城市去攻击它。必须先从后面，从它的后腿——农村去攻击它，那儿它是软弱的。在一次又一次的打击下，它的后腿总有一天会断的。占领了农村后包围城市，那时候再狠狠揍它的脑袋。
    文章说，印度农村居住着约四亿农民，他们受的压迫和剥削最大，对敌人的仇恨最深。他们会拚命战斗，长期战斗，直到打破大象的脑袋。
    文章最后指出，印度一切革命者必须进行艰苦的长期的革命斗争，消灭敌人。
