In the midst of the triumphant songs of the nationwide Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Revolutionary Committee of the First Automobile Works in Changchun has been born.

Revolutionary workers are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to launch a fierce attack on the class enemy, and to carry the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, May 4th: Amid the triumphant songs of the nationwide Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Revolutionary Committee of the First Automobile Works, a crucial base of China's automotive industry, has recently been born, and the revolutionary and production situation in the entire factory is exceptionally good.

The birth of the Revolutionary Committee of the First Automobile Works in Changchun signifies the complete failure of the evil plot by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the factory to restore capitalism. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Fifteen years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao personally wrote the eleven shining golden words "First Automobile Works Foundation Commemoration," illuminating the brilliant future of China's automotive industry. Under Chairman Mao's loving care, a new automotive industry team rapidly grew and strengthened, making significant contributions to China's socialist construction and supporting the world revolution. Ten years ago in spring, Chairman Mao, full of vigor, traveled thousands of miles to be among the workers of the automobile factory, inspiring the broad revolutionary workers to raise the three red banners even higher, and launching a great leap forward. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin have shown great concern, inspiring the proletarian revolutionary faction and the broad revolutionary workers of this factory, adding boundless strength, and achieving decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

For a long time, the First Automobile Works in Changchun has been a battleground of intense struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. The top handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, through their agents in the automobile factory, have done everything possible to resist Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, peddling revisionist goods. They preached the theory of "class struggle extinction," advocating "production first," "technology first," "experts first," and promoting "material incentives," opposing the prominence of proletarian politics. They attempted to turn this socialist enterprise into a capitalist enterprise. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they stubbornly carried out the bourgeois reactionary line, ruthlessly suppressing the proletarian revolutionary faction, inciting people to fight against each other, disrupting the revolution, and disrupting production, committing heinous crimes against the Party and the people.

The broad revolutionary workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, saw through the tricks of this handful of class enemies and waged a tenacious struggle against them. Under the support of the People's Liberation Army's leftist troops, the broad revolutionary workers united as one, with an irresistible heroic spirit, launching a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents within the factory. They exposed the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, thoroughly criticized and denounced the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line and its counter-revolutionary revisionist line on the industrial front, and completely smashed the handful of class enemies' evil plot to restore capitalism.

Now, the revolutionary and production situation at the First Automobile Works in Changchun is exceptionally good and getting better. The mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works is more widespread and in-depth than ever. Over 300 sessions of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been held, with more than 25,000 participants. The revolutionary situation has promoted the development of production throughout the factory. The automobile production of the entire factory is gradually increasing, and some sub-factories' product output has already exceeded the highest level since the start of production.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Just after its establishment, the Revolutionary Committee of the First Automobile Works in Changchun, in accordance with the brilliant directive of the great leader Chairman Mao, leads the revolutionary workers of the entire factory to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to launch a fierce attack on the class enemy. The broad revolutionary workers are determined to carry the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end, to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to turn the First Automobile Works into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

　　在全国无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利的凯歌声中
　　长春第一汽车制造厂革委会诞生
    革命职工决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，把无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底
    据新华社长春四日电　在全国无产阶级文化大革命取得节节胜利的凯歌声中，我国汽车工业重要基地长春第一汽车制造厂革命委员会最近光荣诞生，全厂革命和生产形势空前大好。
    长春第一汽车制造厂革委会的诞生，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在汽车厂代理人复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋彻底破产。这是毛泽东思想的重大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的重大胜利。
    十五年前，我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲手写下了“第一汽车制造厂奠基纪念”十一个金光闪闪的大字，照亮了我国汽车工业发展的光辉前程。在毛主席的亲切关怀下，一支新兴的汽车工业队伍迅速地成长壮大，为我国社会主义建设和支援世界革命作出了重大贡献。十年前的春天，毛主席又千里迢迢，神采奕奕，来到汽车厂工人中间，鼓舞着广大革命工人更高地举起三面红旗，掀起了大跃进的高潮。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，毛主席和以毛主席为首、以林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的亲切关怀，使这个厂的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工受到了极大的鼓舞，增添了无穷的力量，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    长期以来，长春第一汽车厂一直存在着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大一小撮走资派，通过他们在汽车厂的代理人，千方百计地抵制毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，大肆贩卖修正主义货色。他们宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论，鼓吹“生产挂帅”、“技术第一”、“专家第一”，大搞“物质刺激”，反对突出无产阶级政治。他们妄图把这个社会主义企业变成资本主义企业。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们又顽固地执行资产阶级反动路线，残酷地镇压无产阶级革命派，挑动群众斗群众，破坏革命，破坏生产，对党对人民犯下了滔天罪行。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命职工，识破了这一小撮阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，同他们进行了针锋相对的顽强斗争。广大革命职工在解放军支左部队的支持下，团结一致，以势不可挡的英雄气概，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在厂内的代理人，发动了猛烈攻击，揪出了党内一小撮走资派，狠揭狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线及其在工业战线上推行的反革命修正主义路线，彻底粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。
    现在，长春第一汽车制造厂的革命和生产形势一派大好，越来越好。全厂活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，从来没有象今天这样广泛深入。各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班已举办了三百多期，参加学习的有二万五千多人。革命的大好形势，推动了全厂生产的发展。全厂汽车产量逐步上升，有些分厂的产品产量已经超过了开工生产以来的最高水平。
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”长春第一汽车制造厂革命委员会刚成立，他们就遵照伟大领袖毛主席的这一光辉指示，率领全厂革命职工更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步向阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻。广大革命职工决心把无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，把第一汽车厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
