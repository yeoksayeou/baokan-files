The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Dashiqiao Magnesite Mine have been using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, prioritizing revolution and promoting production development. Broad revolutionary workers have emphasized proletarian politics, fiercely criticizing the revisionist fallacies of "material incentives" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev. Since the Cultural Revolution, the mine has consistently exceeded the national production plan every month.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, May 14—The broad revolutionary workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Dashiqiao Magnesite Mine have used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon to fiercely criticize the revisionist trash of "material incentives" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. They have emphasized proletarian politics, and the revolutionary and production situation of the entire mine has been getting better and better. Since the Cultural Revolution, this mine has fully and exceedingly completed the national production plan every month.

In December last year, after the Revolutionary Committee of Dashiqiao Magnesite Mine was established under a good revolutionary and production situation, due to the lingering poison of the "material incentives" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev not being thoroughly cleansed, class enemies took the opportunity to cause trouble, inciting a few workers to create anarchism, which temporarily affected production. Facing this situation, the Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the mine, firmly emphasized proletarian politics. They placed the revolutionary criticism, ideological and political work, and the promotion of people's ideological revolutionization at the forefront of all work, determined to use Mao Zedong Thought to criticize everything, reform everything, and promote everything, and to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide production and manage socialist enterprises. They organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class attended by members of the three-in-one leadership teams at various levels. In the study class, they organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work" and to recall the experience of promoting production while carrying out the revolution in the past two years of the Cultural Revolution. They all said that in the past complex and sharp class struggles, production was able to exceed the plan every month because the broad revolutionary workers had mastered the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, promoted ideological revolutionization, fiercely criticized the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anshan Iron and Steel Company, raised proletarian awareness, and regarded firmly responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp the revolution and promote production" as an actual action to defend Chairman Mao and defend the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin.

Through recalling and comparing, they more deeply realized that relying on "material incentives" to produce is to take the capitalist dead end; only by emphasizing proletarian politics to promote production is to take the bright path of socialism.

After the members of the three-in-one revolutionary leadership teams at various levels of the mine enhanced their understanding of the importance of emphasizing proletarian politics in the study class, they immediately led the broad revolutionary workers of the entire mine to launch a new wave of revolutionary criticism. They organized various types of study classes, starting from criticizing the revisionist trash of "material incentives" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, using the "ten thousand graves" from the Japanese puppet period as a living teaching material, and carrying out activities to recall bitterness and think of sweetness. At the same time, they combined actual problems in the production struggle, criticized the revisionist enterprise line of "technology first" and "experts managing the factory" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, fully implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and made Chairman Mao's personally annotated "Anshan Constitution" known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts. Through recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, many workers angrily denounced the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev promoting "material incentives." They said: The Chinese Khrushchev promotes "material incentives," which is to stimulate the socialist enthusiasm of the working class to nothing, so that they can restore capitalism, let us suffer twice, and take the wrong path. We will not agree to this by a thousand times, by ten thousand times!

Through the revolutionary criticism, the broad workers poured their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and their deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev into the actual actions of firmly grasping the revolution and vigorously promoting production. The workers of the sintering workshop pooled their wisdom, helped each other, and successfully developed a gasification cooling vertical furnace after repeated practices, greatly improving the working conditions of the workers, effectively increasing the quantity and quality of the products, saving ten ten thousand yuan for the state each furnace per year, and solving the long-standing major difficulty in production. They combined this technological innovation with the revolutionary criticism, further realizing that the gasification cooling vertical furnace had not been successfully developed in the past was because "material incentives" constrained people's socialist enthusiasm. As the revolutionary criticism deepened, the class awareness of the broad revolutionary workers continuously improved, and the momentum of grasping the revolution and promoting production became more and more vigorous. The entire mine presented a good situation of revolution and production.

    鞍钢大石桥镁矿用毛泽东思想统帅一切
    革命摆在首位　带动生产发展
    广大革命职工突出无产阶级政治，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“物质刺激”等修正主义谬论。文化大革命以来，全矿月月超额完成国家生产计划
    据新华社鞍山十四日电　鞍钢大石桥镁矿广大革命职工，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为最锐利的武器狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货，大力突出无产阶级政治，全矿革命和生产形势越来越好。自从无产阶级文化大革命以来，这个矿月月都全面超额完成了国家生产计划。
    去年十二月，大石桥镁矿革命委员会在革命和生产一派大好形势下成立以后，由于中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“物质刺激”的流毒没有肃清，阶级敌人也趁机捣乱，煽动少数工人闹无政府主义，因而一度影响了生产。面对这种情况，革命委员会在驻矿解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，坚定不移地突出无产阶级政治，他们把开展革命的大批判，做好思想政治工作，促进人的思想革命化放在一切工作的首位，决心用毛泽东思想来批判一切、改造一切、推动一切，用毛泽东思想来统帅生产，办好社会主义企业。他们举办了有各级三结合领导班子成员参加的毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，组织大家学习了毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，回忆了在近两年来的无产阶级文化大革命中抓革命促生产的经验。他们都说，在过去复杂尖锐的阶级斗争中，生产所以能月月超产，就是因为广大革命职工掌握了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，促进了思想革命化，狠揭狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍钢代理人破坏鞍钢生产的罪行，提高了无产阶级觉悟，把坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，看作是誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的实际行动。他们还通过回忆对比，更深刻地认识到，靠“物质刺激”去搞生产，是走资本主义的死胡同；只有靠突出无产阶级政治促生产，才是走社会主义的光明大道。
    矿各级革命三结合领导班子的成员在学习班里提高了对突出无产阶级政治的重要性的认识以后，立即带领全矿广大革命职工掀起了革命大批判的新高潮。他们通过办各种类型的学习班，从批判中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货入手，利用日伪时期的“万人坑”当活教材，开展了忆苦思甜活动。同时，他们还结合生产斗争中的实际问题，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的“技术第一”、“专家治厂”等修正主义办企业路线，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，使毛主席亲自批示的“鞍钢宪法”家喻户晓，深入人心。通过忆苦思甜，许多工人愤怒地控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫搞“物质刺激”的罪行。他们说：中国赫鲁晓夫搞“物质刺激”，就是要把我们工人阶级的社会主义积极性刺激得一干二净，以便他们复辟资本主义，让我们吃二遍苦，走回头路，我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应！
    通过革命的大批判，广大职工把对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，倾注到狠抓革命猛促生产的实际行动上。烧结车间工人群策群力，互相协助，经过反复实践，试制成功了汽化冷却竖炉，大大改善了工人的劳动条件，有效地提高了产品的数量和质量，每炉每年可为国家节约十万元，解决了生产中长期没有解决的老大难问题。他们又结合这项技术革新的成功，再搞革命大批判，进一步认识到，过去汽化冷却竖炉所以一直没有搞成功，就是因为“物质刺激”束缚了人们的社会主义积极性。随着革命大批判的深入展开，广大革命职工的阶级觉悟不断提高，抓革命促生产的劲头也越来越足，全矿呈现一派革命和生产的大好形势。
