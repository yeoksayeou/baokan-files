On May 8th, in the capital Beijing, we met our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao. This most joyous day will forever be etched in our hearts.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! When your towering and robust figure appeared, what we saw before us was a radiant sun; with every wave of your hand, a smooth and broad path to communism unfolded before our eyes!

Our hearts were pounding, and our blood was boiling. We cried out incessantly: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! In the dark days when the serf owners ruled, we were treated as mere speaking tools, worse than cattle and horses. It was you, Chairman Mao, who parted the clouds and let us see the blue sky and the sun, allowing us to become true human beings.

The three great lords, the stubborn clique of capitalist roaders within the party, and all the ghosts and monsters, we have deep grievances and blood debts with them. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we organized the "Serf Spear" Red Guards and, together with the broad revolutionary masses, followed the course you pointed out. We bravely joined the battle, charging against the clique of capitalist roaders headed by China's Khrushchev, and firing at the reactionary bourgeois line. After arduous struggles, we have already defeated them thoroughly. Today, standing by your side, we solemnly vow: We will firmly follow the direction you have pointed out, fight forward to achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and defend our red homeland for eternity. We will fight to defend your proletarian revolutionary line in life, and dedicate ourselves to it in death.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Although only a few dozen of us, the children of emancipated serfs, are standing by your side today, our oath represents the wishes of millions of emancipated serfs. You have received not just a few dozen of us, the children of emancipated serfs, but we have used every means available to spread the joyous news of your reception throughout the vast plateau. The 1.3 million emancipated serfs of Tibet feel as if they have seen our most beloved great leader, Chairman Mao.

    五月八日，在首都北京，我们见到了最亲最亲的亲人，我们的伟大导师毛主席。这个最幸福的日子，将永远永远铭记在我们的心上。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！当您高大健壮的身影出现时，展现在我们眼前的是一轮光芒四射的金太阳；您每一挥手，在我们的眼前就展现出一条通向共产主义的康庄大道！
    我们的心在激烈地跳动，我们的热血沸腾。我们不停地高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！在那暗无天日的农奴主当道的年月里，我们曾经是被当做会说话的工具，是不如牛马的牛马。是您老人家拨开乌云，我们才见到了青天，看到了太阳，成为真正的人。
    三大领主、顽固的党内一小撮走资派和一切牛鬼蛇神，我们和他们有深冤大恨，血海深仇。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们组织起“农奴戟”红卫兵，和广大革命群众一起，沿着您老人家指引的航道，勇敢地投入战斗，向中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派冲杀，向资产阶级反动路线开火，经过艰苦奋斗，已经把他们打得落花流水。今天，在您老人家身边，我们再一次庄严宣誓：紧紧沿着您老人家指引的方向战斗前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，保卫我们的红色江山万代千秋不变色。我们一定要生为捍卫您的无产阶级革命路线而战斗，死为捍卫您的无产阶级革命路线而献身。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！今天站在您身边的虽然只是我们几十个翻身农奴的儿女，但我们的誓言，是百万翻身农奴的心愿。您接见的不只是我们几十个翻身农奴的子女，我们已经用了一切可以利用的工具，把您老人家接见的喜讯传遍万里高原。西藏一百三十万翻身农奴，都象见到了我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。
