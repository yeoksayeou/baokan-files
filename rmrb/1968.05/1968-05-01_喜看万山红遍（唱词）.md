The red sun shines brightly over the four directions with rays of light that stretch to the heavens.
The east wind is strong, and the red flag dances high, playing a joyous melody.
Mountains become instruments, and the sea becomes a score, singing a song of praise: the revolutionary committee of the "three-in-one combination" blooms in the sunlight.

(Spoken) Chairman Mao says, "The revolutionary committee is good!"

Chairman Mao's words shake the world,
Chairman Mao waves his mighty hand, pointing out the direction.
Following Chairman Mao's strategic deployment,
The revolutionary masses surge forward like a red tide, breaking waves and overcoming obstacles.
They conquer evil and tame the dragon, turning the tide.
Workers, peasants, and soldiers take power, building an iron wall.
Through the fire, a red political power is forged,
In the storm, a magnificent poem is written.
The revolutionary committee blooms like red flowers everywhere,
Celebrating victory, expressing boundless joy.

Look at today's situation, everything is good, and the mountains are red all over,
Looking to the future, a brilliant and splendid blueprint is unfolding.
Red May, May is red, the song of victory is resounding,
The revolutionary "three-in-one combination" blooms like red flowers.
It is like a pine tree standing tall in the snow,
It is like an eagle soaring in the storm,
It is like a lighthouse shining on the shore,
It is like red flags fluttering on the mountaintops.
The revolutionary committee of the "three-in-one combination" is full of vitality,
Following Chairman Mao, sailing far and wide.
Raising high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought,
Facing wind and rain, bravely forging ahead.

Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions,
Lead by example, learn and apply, with a red heart and strong will.
We have Chairman Mao, the great helmsman,
We have Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts,
The "three-in-one combination" shows its power, commanding the battle,
No matter how strong the winds and waves, our hearts are filled with sunshine.

(Spoken) Chairman Mao says: "Believe in and rely on the majority of the cadres."

Revolutionary old cadres have been tested and tried,
They have served the people and endured hardships.
They are good at organizing and fighting, with rich experience,
They are an important revolutionary force.
Old cadres and new cadres help each other,
Red successors grow vigorously.

(Spoken) Chairman Mao says: "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to connect with the masses."
The revolutionary committee absorbs representatives of the masses,
Daring to fight and win, strong as steel.
The revolutionary faction is rich in practical experience,
They understand the revolutionary aspirations of the masses.
With the masses, heart to heart, flesh and blood connected,
The glorious tradition is greatly carried forward.

(Spoken) Chairman Mao says: "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people."
Chairman Mao's people's army,
Is invincible in attack and victory, unparalleled in the world.
Military representatives participate in leadership at all levels,
Spreading red seeds, setting examples, and establishing models.
The military and the people unite closely to fight the enemy together,
The revolutionary reins are secure.
Even if there are storms and waves,
Even if there are tigers and wolves blocking the way,
Even if there are demons rampaging!
Chairman Mao holds the helm of the revolution,
Riding the east wind, breaking through the waves, unstoppable!

The "three-in-one combination" is powerful and invincible,
Playing victory songs in the fire, spreading far and wide.
Study classes are widely popular, blooming everywhere,
Chairman Mao's thoughts shine brightly.
Every heart is engraved with class struggle,
Fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, becoming stronger in battle.
Opposing the rightist tendency and splitting, sweeping away the demonic fog,
Leveling the "mountaintops" and sweeping away factions like going to battle.
Shattering the wolfish ambitions of the capitalist roaders,
Breaking the imperialist, revisionist, and reactionary one dream of yellow millet.
Building an iron wall to prevent revisionism,
Welcoming the sunshine of the motherland everywhere.
Chairman Mao waves his mighty hand, the future is bright,
The revolutionary committee takes the lead, advancing in big strides.

"Grasp revolution, promote production" shouldering heavy responsibilities,
Promoting work and preparedness, with high morale.
The military loves the people, and the people support the military, fighting side by side,
Crossing dangerous shoals and rapid currents, overturning seas and rivers.
Every new instruction from Chairman Mao,
Is an invincible revolutionary force.
Looking at the mountains covered in red,
The song of victory shakes the heavens and earth, spreading far and wide.
In industry, good news is frequently reported,
In agriculture, the news of a bumper harvest is flying.
The situation of the motherland is good, the song of victory is heard everywhere,
The red sun shines over the globe, the battle song is resonant.
On the continent of Africa, the war drums are urgent,
On the coast of Latin America, a great wave is surging,
In the jungles of South Vietnam, red flags are flying,
In Washington, a fierce fire is raging.
Joyfully seeing the four oceans with surging waves,
Joyfully seeing the five continents with thunderous storms,
Joyfully seeing the magnificent rivers and mountains of the motherland,
Joyfully seeing the spring light on the journey of ten thousand miles.
Blood boils, waves surge, joyfully shouting,
Thousands of songs and tens of thousands of melodies sing aloud:
Hail Chairman Mao, long live, long live!
Sing of Chairman Mao, eternal life!
