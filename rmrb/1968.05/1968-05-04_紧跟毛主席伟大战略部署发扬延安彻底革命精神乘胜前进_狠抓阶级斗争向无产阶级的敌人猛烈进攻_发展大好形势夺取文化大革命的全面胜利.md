They are determined to place the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work, continue to establish and run Mao Zedong Thought study classes; further promote the "Support the Army and Love the People" movement, strengthen military-civilian unity; keep the struggle aimed at a handful of class enemies, distinguish between enemy and internal contradictions, and be good at uniting one's own class ranks, good at uniting and winning over allies, strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, unite the vast majority, further consolidate and develop the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the revolutionary masses, form a mighty revolutionary army, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end.

The New China News Agency reported on May 3rd that just after celebrating the May 1st International Labor Day, revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of revolutionary people and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army across the country are today in high spirits, enthusiastically celebrating the glorious birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City. They joyously shout: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao! Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" The hundreds of millions of military and civilians across the country resolutely declare that they will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, inherit and carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of Yan'an, deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, continuously take the initiative to attack the enemies of the proletariat, advance victoriously, develop the good situation, and seize comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.

The Revolutionary Committees or Revolutionary Preparation Groups of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Guizhou, Shanxi, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Jiangxi, Gansu, Henan, Hebei, Hubei, Guangdong, Jilin, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Ningxia, Anhui, Sichuan, Guangxi, and other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions all sent telegrams of congratulations, enthusiastically celebrating the birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City. Many regions held celebration meetings and discussions for the establishment of the Revolutionary Committees of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City, and also seriously studied the editorial "The Spirit of Yan'an Shines Forever" from the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily. The Revolutionary Committee of Shijiazhuang City and the local garrison held a celebration meeting on the evening of May 3rd. Leaders of the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the local garrison, the Shijiazhuang Regional Revolutionary Committee, the Shijiazhuang City Revolutionary Committee, and the revolutionary mass organizations attended the celebration meeting. Representatives attending the Conference of Active Elements Studying Mao Zedong Thought in Hangzhou City immediately held a discussion upon hearing the joyous news of the establishment of the Revolutionary Committees of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City. Revolutionary masses and soldiers across the country excitedly pointed out that the establishment of Revolutionary Committees in Shaanxi Province and most provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country eloquently demonstrates that the situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat across the country is excellent and getting better and better. They expressed that they would learn from the proletarian revolutionary cadres and the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shaanxi Province, inherit and carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of Yan'an, and carry through the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end.

Our great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is, in essence, a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the broad revolutionary masses led by it and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." While celebrating the birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City, the hundreds of millions of military and civilians across the country, in combination with the local struggle realities, further studied and understood Chairman Mao's great teachings, more deeply realizing that the closer the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is to comprehensive victory, the more complex and profound the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads becomes. The enemy will not resign themselves to defeat; they will make their last struggle. We must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," further raise the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the proletariat, actively and continuously launch fierce attacks on the enemies of the proletariat, deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly eliminate the poison of all revisionist counter-revolutionary ideas spread by the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, such as Liu Shaoqi, and their agents, thoroughly overthrow and expose the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and expose all hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries, safeguard the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, safeguard the newly born Revolutionary Committees, and further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. At present, we must firmly oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, and smash the rightist reversal wind. The broad masses across the country expressed that to thoroughly defeat the enemies of the proletariat, we must follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, be good at uniting our own class ranks, be good at uniting and winning over allies, strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, unite the vast majority, form a mighty revolutionary army. We must distinguish between enemy and internal contradictions, always aim the struggle at a handful of class enemies. We will advance victoriously, develop the good situation, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end. Members of the Revolutionary Committees of many factories and enterprises in the capital, in combination with the situation of their own units, analyzed the current situation of class struggle, unanimously expressing that they would further carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, and aim the struggle at a handful of class enemies. Revolutionary workers of the Beijing Steel Plant, in the high tide of revolutionary criticism, formed a mighty revolutionary army, surrounding a handful of capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries within the factory. The revolutionary workers of this factory said that in the good situation, we must definitely carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating a fallen enemy, thoroughly expose a handful of class enemies, criticize them deeply and thoroughly, overthrow and expose them, and not retreat until we achieve complete victory. The proletarian revolutionary cadres of the Shanghai Shipyard said that in the current good situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, we must be a hundred times more vigilant. We must definitely inherit and carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of Yan'an, be good at identifying the despicable means of counter-revolutionaries, be good at identifying counter-revolutionary two-faced people, and thoroughly smash all the tricks and conspiracies of a handful of class enemies attempting to split the revolutionary ranks. Leaders of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the garrison, in their speeches at the conference on the exchange of experiences in carrying out the revolutionary criticism, expressed that they would hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the spirit of Yan'an, advance victoriously, prevent the relaxation of fighting spirit and stagnation, deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism, concentrate targets, concentrate firepower, and launch active and fierce attacks on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party represented by Liu Shaoqi, as well as traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries, overthrow and expose them, and let them never rise again. Members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Guiyang Cotton Mill said that we must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and launch continuous attacks on class enemies. We proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary workers will never allow a handful of class enemies to reverse the situation, will never allow the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie to reverse the situation, and we will firmly safeguard the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. Comrades participating in the expanded meeting of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee pointed out in the discussion that the great spirit of Yan'an cultivated by the great leader Chairman Mao represents the thorough revolutionary spirit of Marxism-Leninism and represents the spirit of hard struggle of the proletariat. We must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, learn from and carry forward the spirit of Yan'an, lead the revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups to continuously revolutionize and thoroughly revolutionize, actively launch fierce attacks on class enemies, and vow to seize comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

While enthusiastically acclaiming the birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City, the hundreds of millions of military and civilians across the country expressed their determination to take the broad proletarian revolutionary cadres and all soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shaanxi Province as examples, grasp the fundamentals, place the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work, continue to establish and run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They must further promote the "Support the Army and Love the People" movement, strengthen military-civilian unity. They must carry forward the spirit of hard struggle of Yan'an, streamline administration, and save money for the revolution. They must grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness, and advance bravely under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The Conference of Red Guards of Middle and High Schools in Wuhan decided to further promote the "Three Loyalties" activity of being forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in all middle and high schools across the city. They are determined to continue to establish and run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, criticize and reform oneself, and promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, forging themselves into proletarian revolutionary cadres who are determined to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end. The leader of the Revolutionary Committee of the East Factory of the Shandong Paper Mill said that we are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great teaching of "continuing to maintain the spirit of hard struggle," take root among the masses, and blend with the masses, grasp revolution, promote production, and increase paper production to meet the needs of printing more works of Chairman Mao and the revolutionary people of China and the world for revolutionary books. The proletarian revolutionary cadres and the broad revolutionary masses of Liaoning, Sichuan, Guangxi, Fujian, Xinjiang, Yunnan, and Tibet expressed their determination to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, further develop and consolidate the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the proletarian revolutionary cadres, and contribute to the early establishment of the Revolutionary Committees of their provinces and autonomous regions.

The joyous news reached the various units of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces, and the broad soldiers held celebration activities and discussions. They expressed that they would definitely learn from the proletarian revolutionary cadres of Shaanxi Province and the brotherly units stationed in Shaanxi, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Soldiers of the "Red Ninth Company" who followed Chairman Mao to victory in the Long March to Shaanbei said that in the days of war, Chairman Mao led us to fight south and north, defeating Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. In the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, we must definitely carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of Yan'an cultivated by Chairman Mao, closely unite with the proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses across the country, fight shoulder to shoulder, continuously take the initiative to attack the enemies of the proletariat, safeguard the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, safeguard the newly born Revolutionary Committees, and safeguard the dictatorship of the proletariat. Soldiers fighting on the front line of "Three Supports and Two Militaries" expressed that they would definitely resolutely implement the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "support the leftist broad masses," use Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions as sharp weapons, further do a good job in the "Three Supports and Two Militaries" work, and achieve new victories in the great struggle to seize comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.
