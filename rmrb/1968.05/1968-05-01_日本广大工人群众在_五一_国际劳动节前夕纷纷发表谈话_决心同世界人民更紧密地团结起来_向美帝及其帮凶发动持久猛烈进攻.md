On the eve of May Day, the International Labor Day, broad masses of Japanese workers have been speaking out, expressing their determination to unite more closely with the people of the world and launch a sustained and powerful offensive against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

New China News Agency, May 30th: Tokyo News: On the eve of May Day, broad masses of Japanese workers have been speaking out, expressing their determination to unite with the people of the world and launch a sustained and powerful offensive against the reactionary forces in Japan and the United States.

The secretary of the Yokohama branch of the Japan National Railways Union, Suzuki Tsukasa, pointed out that the world revolution is in a very good situation. He went on to say, "We Japanese workers must resolutely continue to fight against U.S. imperialism and drive U.S. imperialism out of Japan and the entire Asia."

Suzuki said: "Through the two large-scale strikes we held last October and this March, we refused to transport fuel for U.S. military aircraft, dealing a heavy blow to the U.S. reactionaries. Through the struggle, the class consciousness of the Yokohama National Railway workers has been greatly heightened, and they are determined to carry the struggle against U.S. imperialism to the end."

Suzuki said: "We must further strengthen the struggle to abolish the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' and overthrow the reactionary Sato government. We are determined to unite closely with the workers and laboring people around the world who are fighting against U.S. imperialism and carry on our struggle to refuse to transport U.S. military supplies to the end."

A dockworker in Sasebo, Ooi Yuji, said: "In the rapidly rising anti-U.S. struggle sweeping the world, the Japanese people have launched one fierce attack after another against U.S. imperialism and the treacherous Sato government. These struggles have raised the level of the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic struggle."

Ooi said: "Chairman Mao, in his statement supporting the struggle of Black people in the United States against violence, issued the great call: 'The people of the world, unite more closely, launch a sustained and powerful offensive against our common enemy, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys!' This is the most correct and powerful indication of the task of struggle for the people of the world under the current situation."

A Tokyo streetcar worker, Ito Takeshi, said: "The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has shaken the world. Inspired by this victory, the people of the world are launching fierce attacks against U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism. In Japan, the struggle against U.S. imperialist rule is also growing stronger." He said: "The Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic struggle is prominently manifested in the recent struggle against the establishment of U.S. field hospitals in Japan, the construction of airfields, and the demand for the removal of U.S. military bases. This anti-U.S. patriotic struggle is becoming more and more fierce, and the Japanese people have now made up their minds not to allow U.S. imperialism to ride roughshod over them."

Ito concluded, "The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The people of the world, unite, defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their running dogs! The people of the world must dare to struggle, must not be afraid of difficulties, must advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will definitely belong to the people. All ghosts and monsters will be destroyed.' As long as the working class of each country unites and follows the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, perseveres in the struggle, it will definitely be able to smash U.S. imperialism."

　　日本广大工人群众在“五一”国际劳动节前夕纷纷发表谈话
　　决心同世界人民更紧密地团结起来
　　向美帝及其帮凶发动持久猛烈进攻
    新华社三十日讯　东京消息：在“五一”国际劳动节前夕，日本广大工人群众纷纷发表谈话，表示决心同全世界人民团结起来，向美日反动派发动持久的猛烈的进攻。
    日本国营铁路工会横滨分会事务局长铃木司指出，现在世界革命是一片大好形势。他接着说，我们日本工人必须坚决地进一步展开反对美帝国主义的斗争，把美帝国主义从日本和整个亚洲赶出去。
    铃木说：我们通过去年十月和今年三月举行的两次大规模的罢工，拒绝为美国军用飞机运输燃料，给美国反动派以沉重的打击。通过斗争，横滨国营铁路工人的阶级觉悟有了很大的提高，他们决心把反对美帝国主义的斗争进行到底。
    铃木说：“我们必须进一步加强废除日美‘安全条约’和推翻佐藤反动政府的斗争。我们决心同全世界正在同美帝国主义作斗争的工人和劳动人民紧密地团结起来，把我们拒绝为美国运输军火的斗争坚持到底。”
    佐世保的码头工人大池勇二说：在世界范围迅速高涨的反美斗争巨浪中，日本人民向美帝国主义和佐藤卖国政府接二连三地发动了猛烈的进攻。这些斗争提高了日本人民的反美爱国斗争的水平。
    大池说：毛主席在支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明中，发出“全世界人民更紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻”的伟大号召，最正确、最有力地指明了在当前形势下全世界人民的斗争任务。
    东京的电车工人伊藤武说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利震撼了全世界。全世界人民在这一胜利的鼓舞下，正在向美帝国主义和现代修正主义发动猛烈的进攻。在日本，反对美帝国主义统治的斗争也在日益加强。”他说：日本人民的反美爱国斗争突出地表现在最近反对美军在日本建立野战医院、修建飞机场和要求撤除美国军事基地的斗争。这种反美爱国斗争越来越猛烈，日本人民现在已下定决心，决不许美帝国主义骑在他们的头上。
    伊藤最后说，伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”只要各国工人阶级团结起来，遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，坚持斗争，就一定能够粉碎美帝国主义。
