Editor's Note: Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "Setting up study classes is a good method. Many problems can be solved in study classes." The primary schools in Beijing's Xuanwu District, following Chairman Mao's instructions, have set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes both inside and outside the school, with the help of the People's Liberation Army. Practice has shown that this approach is very effective.

The deepening of the "class struggle in the classroom" inevitably requires close coordination with after-school activities. By linking school education with family education and social education through after-school study classes, we can better apply Mao Zedong Thought in practice, resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology among students, enhance their revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline. This will help consolidate and develop the "class struggle in the classroom."

The after-school Mao Zedong Thought study classes should not only be set up in primary schools but also in middle schools. Only by setting up study classes both inside and outside the school can we truly forge red revolutionary successors in the red furnace of Mao Zedong Thought.

The revolutionary teachers and parents of students in the primary schools of Beijing's Xuanwu District all regard setting up good after-school Mao Zedong Thought study classes as their duty. They actively support the after-school study classes and help students run them well. This spirit is worth greatly promoting.

The soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing's Xuanwu District for military training have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and helped set up after-school Mao Zedong Thought study classes in more than seventy primary schools. In the past few months of practice, many vivid examples have proven that these after-school Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organized by revolutionary young people themselves, are classrooms for learning class struggle and strongholds for smashing the enemy's attempts to corrupt young people.

Most primary schools in Xuanwu District implement a two-shift teaching system, and students spend less time in school. As the "class struggle in the classroom" deepens, revolutionary teachers and students have deeply felt that to truly teach Mao Zedong Thought, we must use Mao Zedong Thought to guide all student activities inside and outside the school.

After Chairman Mao issued the great directive: "Setting up study classes is a good method. Many problems can be solved in study classes," revolutionary teachers and students were overjoyed. They loudly proposed: "We must teach Mao Zedong Thought in the classroom and set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes outside the school." Revolutionary teachers and parents enthusiastically support setting up after-school study classes. They say: "This is our duty, not an extra responsibility." Currently, all primary schools in Xuanwu District have set up after-school study classes.

Strengthening the Class Consciousness of Young People

Revolutionary young people in Xuanwu District, following Chairman Mao's instructions, never forget class struggle and turn the study classes into classrooms for learning class struggle, effectively smashing the enemy's attempts to corrupt young people. Some young people who were once seriously influenced by bourgeois ideology have become conscious fighters against bourgeois ideology after participating in the study classes.

In the second primary school of Malian Dao, there was a student who was once used by bad elements in society to do bad things. The stationed soldiers and revolutionary teachers, upon learning this, first helped him draw a clear line between himself and the bad elements, and then encouraged him to join the after-school study class. He studied Chairman Mao's works with everyone, participated in the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism, further recognized his mistakes, and decided to reform himself according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Recently, a counter-revolutionary economic wind blew through society, and someone tried to lure him into participating in the activities. This student firmly rejected, saying: "No! I will go to the study class. Revolutionary young people will always be loyal to Chairman Mao and will never do anything harmful to socialism. I advise you not to do this either." Similar examples of transformation can be found in many study classes.

Young people have also undergone a test of class struggle in the process of running good after-school study classes. After the sixth grade, class two of Jiudaowan Primary School set up an after-school study class, a small group of people with ulterior motives in society launched an attack on them, trying to disintegrate this study class. They enhanced their class consciousness, held the red book, and recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "Resolutely determine to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory," firmly resisting this perverse trend and running the study class better and better.

Consolidating the "Class Struggle in the Classroom"

The "class struggle in the classroom" is the current direction of the school struggle. The after-school Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Xuanwu District actively carry out activities around this center. When the school criticizes the revisionist educational line, the study class conducts a paragraph-by-paragraph study of the old textbooks; when the school studies Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the study class studies and discusses the great situation; when the school holds struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism meetings, the study class studies the content of the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism drafts. Recently, many primary schools in Xuanwu District have established Little Red Guards organizations. Some students have developed complacency, while others have become discouraged and passive. The study class, in response to these active thoughts, carries out struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism activities.

In opposing anarchist tendencies, after-school study classes have also played an active supporting role. Many after-school study classes have exposed and criticized the harmfulness of anarchism according to the different specific situations of each school. Some study classes have even formulated agreements to overcome anarchist tendencies. When the third grade, class two of Sijiakeng Primary School began the "class struggle in the classroom," the revolutionary order was often disrupted. Since the after-school Mao Zedong Thought study class was set up, the school and the study class together organized the study of Chairman Mao's relevant discussions on opposing anarchism, exposed and criticized the harmfulness of anarchism, maintaining a normal attendance rate for the entire class, and many students' spiritual outlook has undergone significant changes.

Self-Education and Self-Management

To better educate themselves, they established a revolutionary learning style. In the after-school study class, the broad masses of teachers and students repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's discussions on revolutionary learning style, took "struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism" as the guideline, and took the latest instructions and the "Three Old Articles" as the main content. They adopted the method of learning while discussing, targeting the issues, and setting up a battlefield for struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism, carrying out revolutionary criticism and educational revolution. Many study classes learned one of Chairman Mao's instructions and criticized one sentence of China's Khrushchev's black words, and checked their own thoughts accordingly. In this way, they educated themselves, achieving good results.

In the process of establishing a good learning style, the study class always followed Chairman Mao's instruction: "Officers teach soldiers, soldiers teach officers, soldiers teach soldiers." Everyone is both a student and a teacher. The after-school study class always pays attention to developing students' independent thinking and pioneering spirit, letting students teach and learn by themselves. Whoever is in line with Mao Zedong Thought is listened to and followed. In this way, the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism activities were elevated, and at the same time, the thought revolutionization of teachers and students was promoted. Teachers and students said: "The after-school study class has greatly enhanced our ability to educate and manage ourselves."

Linking School, Family, and Social Education

The establishment of after-school Mao Zedong Thought study classes fundamentally changed the phenomenon of school education, social education, and family education being disconnected. Many old workers, revolutionary cadres, and poor and lower-middle peasants voluntarily became instructors for the after-school study classes, giving lectures to students about the situation, Chairman Mao's revolutionary struggle history, and carrying out bitter-sweet education, making young people stand firm and resist in the storms of class struggle. A student from Jiudaowan Primary School, Wang Panqi, used to fight, curse, cause trouble, and not study Chairman Mao's works. After participating in the after-school Mao Zedong Thought study class, he listened to old workers denouncing the evils of the old society and talking about the sweetness of the new society, receiving extremely profound education. He said: "I was wrong in the past and didn't listen to Chairman Mao's words. I will definitely study Chairman Mao's works and decide to follow the path of Lei Feng and Li Wenzhong Uncle." Now he performs well and has been selected as a member of the Little Red Guards service team.

Students in the after-school study classes actively help families and neighborhoods set up study classes, "one person leads the whole family, one group leads the whole lane," promoting the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism activities in families and neighborhoods. They proposed: to be red in school, red in society, and red in the family. The study class is not only a fighting collective for studying Chairman Mao's works but also a small propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought. Wherever they go, they bring Mao Zedong Thought. The after-school Mao Zedong Thought study classes of schools like Xiangchang Road often perform for the resident groups, workers' families, and military families, propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the masses. Some students from Baihuafang West Street Primary School also help worker uncles and aunts push coal in their spare time. They propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions while working. Parents praised: "The after-school study class educated the young heroes, and the young heroes educated us, the older generation." (with photos)

    把校外学习班办成阶级斗争的大课堂
    北京市宣武区七十多所小学在解放军帮助下，建立了校外毛泽东思想学习班
    编者按：我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”北京市宣武区各小学遵照毛主席的教导，在解放军的帮助下，不但在校内办毛泽东思想学习班，在校外也办毛泽东思想学习班。事实证明，这样做效果很好。
      校内复课闹革命的深入发展，必然要求校外活动密切配合。通过校外学习班，把学校教育与家庭教育、社会教育联系起来，就能够更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，抵制资产阶级思想对学生的侵蚀，提高学生的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，从而有助于巩固和发展校内复课闹革命。
      校外毛泽东思想学习班，不但小学要办，中学也要办。只有校内校外处处办起学习班，在毛泽东思想的红色熔炉中，才能真正锻炼出红色的革命接班人。
    北京宣武区各小学革命教师和学生家长，都把办好校外毛泽东思想学习班当作自己份内的事。他们积极支持校外学习班，帮助学生把校外学习班办好。这种精神值得大大发扬。
    在北京市宣武区执行军训任务的人民解放军指战员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，帮助宣武区七十多所小学，建立了校外毛泽东思想学习班。在几个月的实践过程中，许多生动事例证明，这种由革命青少年自己举办起来的校外毛泽东思想学习班，是学习阶级斗争的大课堂，是粉碎阶级敌人腐蚀青少年的坚强阵地。
    北京市宣武区大部分小学实行二部制教学，学生在校时间比较短。随着复课闹革命深入开展，广大革命师生深切感到：要真正复好毛泽东思想的课，必须用毛泽东思想统帅学生的校内外一切活动。
    在毛主席发出“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的伟大指示后，革命师生欢欣鼓舞。他们响亮地提出：“校内要复毛泽东思想的课，校外要办毛泽东思想学习班。”革命教师和学生家长都热烈支持办校外学习班。他们说：“这是我们份内事，不是份外事。”目前，宣武区各小学都举办了校外学习班。
        增强青少年的阶级斗争观念
    宣武区广大革命青少年按照毛主席的教导，念念不忘阶级斗争，把学习班办成学习阶级斗争的大课堂，有力地粉碎了阶级敌人腐蚀青少年的阴谋。一些一度严重沾染了资产阶级思想的青少年，参加学习班学习后，开始成了自觉抵制资产阶级思想腐蚀的小战士。
    马连道第二小学有个同学，曾经受到社会上坏分子的利用，做了些坏事。驻校解放军、革命教师知道后，首先帮助他划清和坏分子的界限，接着动员他参加了校外学习班。他和大家一起学习毛主席著作，参加斗私批修讲用会，进一步认识到自己的错误，决心按毛主席教导改造自己。不久前，社会上刮起一股反革命经济主义黑风，有人怂恿他去参加活动。这个同学就坚决地拒绝说：“不！我要到学习班去，革命的青少年永远忠于毛主席，绝不做不利于社会主义的事。我劝你们也不要这样做。”类似这个同学转变的事迹，在许多学习班中都可以找到。
    青少年在办好校外学习班的过程中，也经历了一场阶级斗争的考验。九道湾小学六年级二班，办起了校外学习班后，社会上一小撮别有用心的人，对他们进行围攻，企图瓦解这个学习班。他们提高阶级斗争观念，手捧红色宝书，口诵毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，坚决抵制这股歪风，把学习班办得越来越好。
      巩固了校内复课闹革命
    复课闹革命是当前学校斗争大方向。宣武区校外毛泽东思想学习班就围绕这一中心积极开展活动。学校中开展对修正主义教育路线的批判，学习班就对过去的旧教材逐篇进行研究；学校中学习毛主席最新指示，学习班就学习讨论大好形势；学校中开斗私批修讲用会，学习班就研究落实斗私批修讲稿的内容。最近，宣武区许多小学建立了红小兵组织，同学中有的人产生了自满情绪，也有的人自馁消极，学习班针对这些活思想，开展斗私批修活动。
    在反对无政府主义倾向中，校外学习班更起了积极配合作用。许多校外学习班都曾经针对各校不同的具体情况，揭发和批判了无政府主义的危害性。有的学习班还订出克服无政府主义倾向的公约。司家坑小学三年级二班开始复课闹革命时，革命秩序常常受到干扰，自从办了校外毛泽东思想学习班后，校内校外一起组织学习毛主席有关反对无政府主义的论述，揭发批判无政府主义的危害，使全班学生出勤率始终保持正常，许多同学的精神面貌发生显著变化。
      自己教育自己，自己管理自己
    为了更好地自己教育自己，他们树立了革命好学风。在校外学习班里，广大师生反复学习了毛主席关于革命好学风的论述，以“斗私，批修”为纲，以最新指示和“老三篇”为主要内容，采取边学边议，有的放矢的方法，大摆斗私批修的战场，开展革命大批判和教育革命。许多学习班学了毛主席的一个教导，就批一句中国赫鲁晓夫的黑话，并针对自己的思想进行检查，这样自己教育自己，收到了良好的效果。
    在树立好学风的过程中，学习班始终遵照毛主席
  “官教兵，兵教官，兵教兵”的教导，人人既是学员，又是主人，既是学生，又是老师。校外学习班始终注意发挥同学的独立思考和首创精神，让同学自己教、自己学。谁符合毛泽东思想，就听谁的，就照谁的办。这样既使斗私批修活动提高了一步，同时又促进了师生的思想革命化。师生们说：“校外学习班有力地增强了我们自己教育自己、自己管理自己的能力。”
    把学校、家庭、社会教育联系起来
    校外毛泽东思想学习班的建立，根本改变了学校教育、社会教育、家庭教育脱节的现象。许多老工人、革命干部、贫下中农，都主动担任校外学习班的辅导员，给同学讲形势，讲毛主席的革命斗争史，开展忆苦思甜的教育，使青少年在阶级斗争的风浪中，站得稳，顶得住。九道湾小学王盘琪同学过去打架、骂人、肇事，不学习毛主席著作。他参加校外毛泽东思想学习班后，听老工人控诉了旧社会的罪恶，谈了新社会的甜，受到了极其深刻的教育。他说：“过去我错了，没听毛主席的话。我一定努力学习毛主席著作，决心走雷锋、李文忠叔叔的路。”现在他表现很好，被选为红小兵勤务组的成员。
    校外学习班的同学，积极帮助家庭和街道举办学习班，“一人带全家，一组带一巷”，推动了家庭和街道的斗私批修活动。他们提出：要红在学校、红在社会、红在家庭。学习班既是一个学习毛主席著作的战斗集体，又是宣传毛泽东思想的小分队，他们走到那里，就把毛泽东思想带到那里。香厂路等小学的校外毛泽东思想学习班，经常给居民群众、工人家属、军烈属演出，向群众宣传毛泽东思想。白纸坊西街小学有的同学，还在课余时间帮助工人叔叔、阿姨推煤。他们一边劳动，一边宣传毛主席最新指示。家长称赞说：“校外学习班教育了小将，小将又教育了我们老一代。”本报记者（附图片）
