The great era of Mao Zedong is an era of heroes. At this moment, when the people of the entire nation are following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and striving to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin personally approved the order issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to posthumously award Comrade Men He the honorable title of "an unconditionally loyal cadre to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." This is a shining example personally set by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin for the entire Party, the entire army, and the revolutionary people of the entire nation. We warmly acclaim the order issued by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and we resolutely carry out the order issued by the proletarian headquarters, determined to take Comrade Men He as our example and to dedicate everything at any time to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Comrade Men He, at the critical moment when the explosives unexpectedly exploded, bravely threw himself forward, sacrificing his own life to protect the lives of twenty-seven class brothers present. This is the spirit of a great communist, a lofty and thorough spirit of serving the people.

"Navigating the great seas relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." This great spirit comes from the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In the years of war, our army relied on Mao Zedong Thought to win victories; in the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, we must even more firmly grasp this powerful ideological weapon of Mao Zedong Thought. No matter who, which unit, or which organization, and no matter at what time, as long as one grasps Mao Zedong Thought, one will bravely advance, fearlessly sacrificing oneself for the Party and the people even if mountains crumble and the earth splits. Comrade Men He is precisely such a hero of the new era who is dedicated to defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In the sharp and complex struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, we must be like Comrade Men He, listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow Chairman Mao closely, and regard the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought and the defense of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as the first need of life, the first need of the times, and the first need to ensure that our red homeland remains unchanged for thousands of years.

Comrade Men He is an outstanding representative of our army's unconditional loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and a shining example of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. We learn from Comrade Men He and must, like him, implement Vice Chairman Lin's instruction: "To study Chairman Mao's works, one must study with problems in mind, actively study and apply, combine study with use, learn first what is urgently needed, see immediate results, and focus on the 'use' aspect." Only in this way can we truly achieve the goal of living for the struggle of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and dying for the dedication to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, is deeply advancing. Recently, the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the broad revolutionary masses led by it and the reactionary Kuomintang. It is the continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." To learn from Comrade Men He's unconditional loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, firmly grasp class struggle, resolutely oppose right opportunism, right capitulationism, and right splitism, and thoroughly smash the rightist reversal wind. We must deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, ensuring that China's Khrushchev and his counter-revolutionary clique never rise again. We must expose the traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. Let Chairman Mao's revolutionary line shine forever, and let the great red flag of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought fly high forever in the entire nation and the entire world.

    欢呼毛主席和林副主席为我们树立了学习榜样
    南京部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、战斗英雄　张明
    伟大的毛泽东时代是英雄辈出的时代。正当全国人民紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，奋勇夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时刻，我们伟大的领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲自批准，中共中央、中央军委、中央文革发布命令，追授门合同志以“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”的光荣称号，这是毛主席和林副主席亲自为全党、全军、全国革命人民树立的一个光辉典范。我们热烈欢呼以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部发布的命令，我们坚决执行无产阶级司令部发布的命令，决心以门合同志为榜样，随时随地为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而献出自己的一切。
    门合同志在炸药发生意外爆炸的千钧一发之际，奋不顾身地猛扑上去，以自己的生命，保护了在场的二十七个阶级兄弟的生命安全。这是一种伟大的共产主义者的精神，是一种崇高的完全彻底为人民服务的革命精神。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”这种伟大的精神就是来源于战无不胜的毛泽东思想。在战争年代，我军就是靠毛泽东思想打胜仗的；在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，我们更要掌握毛泽东思想这一强大的思想武器。无论那个人、那个部队或那个单位，也不论在任何时候，只要掌握了毛泽东思想，他就会勇往直前，为党、为人民粉身碎骨心不跳，山崩地裂也敢上。门合同志正是这样一个誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线的新时代的英雄。我们在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线尖锐复杂的斗争中，一定要象门合同志那样，听毛主席的话，紧跟毛主席，把活学活用毛泽东思想，捍卫毛主席的革命路线，看作是生命的第一需要，是时代的第一需要，是保证我们红色江山千秋万代永不变色的第一需要。
    门合同志是我军无限忠于毛主席革命路线的一个杰出的代表，是无产阶级专政下继续革命的一个光辉榜样。我们学习门合同志，就要象他那样把林副主席的指示“学习毛主席著作，要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫”，落实在行动上。只有这样，才能真正做到生为毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死为毛主席的革命路线而献身。
    无产阶级文化大革命，在伟大舵手毛主席的指引下，正在深入地向前发展，伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”学习门合同志无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，就必须紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，狠抓阶级斗争，坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾投降主义、右倾分裂主义，彻底粉碎右倾翻案妖风。要深入持久地开展革命大批判，使中国赫鲁晓夫及其反革命黑帮永世不得翻身。要把混进革命队伍的叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子挖出来，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。让毛主席的革命路线千秋万代永放光芒，使马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在全中国、全世界永远高高飘扬。
