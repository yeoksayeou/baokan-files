More than a thousand workers continue their strike, inspired by the workers' and students' movements, French agricultural workers and small farmers also rise up to fight. The ruling clique is in disarray, trying desperately to extinguish the flames of struggle. French revisionists and bourgeois politicians are frantically exploiting the people's struggles to gain capital.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 30th, Paris: More than a thousand French workers, undeterred by the "agreement" forged by the revisionist-controlled trade union leaders and the capitalists, are continuing their nationwide strike with unyielding spirit. Inspired by the workers' and students' movements, French agricultural workers and small farmers are also rising up to fight. The storm of the people's struggle is increasingly fiercely assaulting the rule of the French monopolistic bourgeoisie. The revisionist traitor clique and various bourgeois parties are taking advantage of the situation, trying to use the people's struggles to gain political capital. French President Charles de Gaulle delivered a televised broadcast on the 30th, openly threatening the revolutionary masses.

Since the early hours of the 27th, when the revisionist-controlled General Confederation of Labor and other yellow union leaders reached a "return-to-work agreement" with French capitalists, it has been four days. During these four days, French Prime Minister Georges Pompidou and the chairman of the French Employers' Federation, Paul Huvelin, have been repeatedly urging the revisionists and other yellow union leaders to get the workers back to work immediately. The revisionists and the leaders of the General Confederation of Labor they control have been feverishly engaged in betrayal activities to undermine the workers' resolve in factories and mines. However, the French workers, with their glorious tradition of the Paris Commune revolution, do not listen to their lies and continue to strike. Currently, France's railways, sea, and air transportation, as well as postal services, remain paralyzed. More than half of the country's major factories and mines are still occupied by striking workers. A few enterprises that have not gone on strike have also stopped production due to transportation paralysis and shortages of raw materials. The entire French economy continues to be in a state of paralysis. The French monopolistic bourgeoisie is suffering increasingly heavy blows.

The tide of strikes continues to surge forward. The crew of the "France" ship, numbering a thousand, announced a strike on the 29th and occupied France's largest ocean liner in the vicinity of Le Havre port. The strike wave even reached the French government's command center for suppressing the revolutionary masses—the Ministry of the Interior. The teletype operators of the Ministry of the Interior also announced a strike on the 29th. Workers in Caen sealed off all roads in the city on the same day, expressing their protest against the government and capitalists.

Inspired by the brave struggles of workers and students, French agricultural workers and small farmers are also launching increasingly widespread struggles. Some French agricultural workers decided on the 30th to establish action committees and take over the means of production. On the 24th, French agricultural workers and small farmers held a nationwide demonstration, protesting against the government's agricultural policies that harm the interests of small farmers. In the agricultural center of Nantes in western France, four thousand agricultural workers and small farmers braved the rain to hold meetings in four suburban areas, then gathered in the city center for a march, and held a demonstration in front of the provincial government. The demonstrators bravely fought with the police who came to suppress them. In the southern French city of Ajaccio, six thousand people held a demonstration in front of the provincial government, and the police used tear gas to suppress them. In Limoges, fifteen thousand agricultural workers, small farmers, workers, and students jointly held a demonstration and march, shaking the entire city. In Rennes, workers and students participated in a meeting of more than a thousand agricultural workers and small farmers, supporting their struggles. Demonstrators also set up roadblocks on many highways in western, southern, and central France, disrupting traffic to express their protest.

Faced with the surging mass movement, the French ruling clique is in disarray. French President Charles de Gaulle suddenly canceled a scheduled cabinet meeting on the morning of the 29th and left Paris. Prime Minister Georges Pompidou spent the whole day in urgent consultations with senior officials. Various opposition bourgeois parties in France are engaged in frenzied activities in the parliament, demanding that Pompidou step down.

De Gaulle returned to Paris on the 30th, immediately convened an emergency cabinet meeting, and then delivered a televised broadcast to the nation. De Gaulle announced in his speech that he had made a "decision" not to resign and not to let Pompidou step down, and had ordered the dissolution of the National Assembly and the holding of new parliamentary elections. He claimed that if the current situation continues, he would take "other measures" to "maintain the republic," openly threatening the revolutionary masses.

The revolutionary storm of the French people has made the entire ruling class of Western Europe tremble with fear. British Conservative Party leader Edward Heath said worriedly on the 29th, "When a country loses its direction, no one can say in which direction it might be pushed." The French newspaper "Le Parisien" revealed that West German Foreign Minister Willy Brandt was both worried that the French government could not control the masses' "rebellious movement" and feared that the struggles of the French people would "infect" West Germany.

    不怕镇压不信鬼话　昂首阔步英勇前进
    法国群众斗争风暴猛击反动统治
    一千多万工人继续总罢工，在工人和学生运动鼓舞下，法农业工人和中小农也纷起斗争统治集团手忙脚乱妄图扑灭斗争烈火，法修和资产阶级政客拚命利用群众斗争捞取资本
    据新华社三十日讯　巴黎消息：法国一千多万工人不顾法国修正主义集团的工会头目同资本家炮制的复工“协议”，斗志昂扬地继续坚持全国总罢工。在工人和学生运动的鼓舞下，法国的农业工人和中、小农也纷纷起来斗争。群众斗争的革命风暴，越来越猛烈地冲击着法国垄断资产阶级的统治。法修叛徒集团和形形色色的资产阶级政党趁机加紧活动，力图利用群众的斗争为自己捞取政治资本。法国总统戴高乐三十日发表电视广播演说，对革命群众进行露骨的恫吓。
    自从二十七日凌晨法修控制的总工会和其他黄色工会头目同法国资本家达成复工“协议”，到三十日已经是第四天。四天以来，法国总理蓬皮杜和法国雇主联合会主席于维兰迫不及待地一再催促法修和其他黄色工会头目要工人马上复工，法修及其控制的总工会的头目为此在工矿企业中狂热地进行瓦解工人斗志的叛卖活动。可是，有着光荣的巴黎公社革命传统的法国工人不听他们的鬼话，继续坚持罢工。目前，法国的铁路、海、空交通和邮电仍然停顿。全国半数以上的主要厂矿企业仍被罢工工人占领。少数没有罢工的企业也由于交通停顿、原料不足等原因而停止生产。整个法国的经济生活继续陷于瘫痪状态。法国垄断资产阶级受到越来越沉重的打击。
    罢工的怒潮继续向前发展。“法兰西号”的一千名船员二十九日宣布罢工，并且在勒阿弗尔港附近占领了这条法国最大的远洋邮船。罢工的浪潮甚至波及到法国政府镇压革命群众的指挥部——内政部。内政部的电传打字机报务员二十九日也宣布罢工。卡昂市的工人同一天封锁了这个城市的全部道路，向政府和资本家表示抗议。
    在工人和学生的英勇斗争的推动和鼓舞下，法国农业工人和中、小农也展开了越来越广泛的斗争。一些法国农业工人三十日决定建立行动委员会，采取接管生产手段的行动。二十四日，法国农业工人和中、小农曾举行了全国性的示威，抗议政府损害中、小农利益的农业政策。在法国西部的农业中心南特，四千农业工人和中、小农冒着大雨在郊区四个地方开会，接着集中到市区游行，并在省政府前举行示威。示威者同前来镇压的警察英勇搏斗。在法国南部的阿让，六千群众在省政府前举行示威，警察使用催泪弹进行镇压。在里摩日，一万五千多农业工人、中小农、工人和学生联合举行示威游行，震动了全市。在雷纳，工人和学生参加了一千多农业工人、中小农的集会，支持他们的斗争。示威者还在法国西部、南部和中部的许多公路上筑起路障，中断了交通，以表示抗议。
    在日益高涨的群众运动的冲击下，法国统治集团手忙脚乱。法国总统戴高乐二十九日上午突然取消了预定的内阁会议，离开了巴黎。总理蓬皮杜整日同高级官员进行紧急磋商。法国的各个资产阶级在野党在议会中进行狂热的活动，纷纷要求蓬皮杜下台。
    戴高乐三十日回到巴黎，立即召开了紧急内阁会议，并随即向全国发表电视广播演说。戴高乐在演说中宣布：他已下了“决心”，自己既不退职，也不让蓬皮杜下台，并且已下令解散国民议会，重新进行议会选举。他声称，“如果当前的情况继续下去”，他将采取“其他手段”来“维护共和国”，对革命群众进行露骨的恐吓。
    法国人民的革命风暴，使得整个西欧的统治阶级都感到胆战心惊。英国保守党领袖希思二十九日忧心忡忡地说，“当一个国家失去了它的方向时，谁也说不上它可能被推向什么方向。”法国《今日巴黎报》透露，西德外交部长勃兰特既担心法国政府控制不住群众的“造反运动”，更害怕法国人民的斗争会“传染”到西德。
