The tariff and trade wars between imperialist powers

The U.S. imperialists, in an attempt to salvage their financial and economic crises, are trying to shift the burden onto the countries of the European Common Market. This approach naturally provokes resistance from the Common Market countries, exacerbating conflicts between the imperialist nations. Recent disputes between the U.S. and the Common Market over tariff issues indicate that, following the currency wars, tariff and trade wars between imperialist powers will also intensify.

Since the beginning of this year, the Johnson administration has taken a series of measures to reduce the outflow of dollars and expand exports. These measures are primarily aimed at the Common Market countries. For example, restrictions on private capital investments abroad specifically prohibit any increase in investments in the European Common Market countries. The U.S. has also sent high-ranking officials to Europe multiple times to try to expand U.S. exports to Europe. Regarding the value-added tax policies that favor increased exports and limit imports in West Germany and France, the U.S. has openly expressed dissatisfaction and threatened that if the Common Market countries implement such tax policies as planned, the U.S. will increase import taxes to retaliate against the Common Market's exports to the U.S.

The U.S. applies such significant pressure on the Common Market countries because Western Europe is the largest market for U.S. investments and goods. According to estimates by the magazine "U.S. News & World Report," the largest destination for U.S. private overseas investments is Western Europe, totaling $17.5 billion by the end of 1967, with about half, or $8.3 billion, in the Common Market countries. In 1966, U.S. exports to Western Europe accounted for one-third of the total U.S. exports, and more than half of that was to the Common Market countries. Therefore, the U.S. seeks to control Western Europe in economic, political, and military aspects. Although the Western European countries had to rely on the U.S. to restore their strength in the early post-war period, they are unwilling to remain under long-term U.S. control. As their economic strength has relatively increased while the U.S.'s economic strength has relatively declined, the U.S. monopolies and Western European monopolies have engaged in a struggle for control and counter-control, fiercely competing for the shrinking capitalist world market and hegemony in Western Europe. The Common Market, formed in 1958 by France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, is a tool for Western European monopolies to fight against U.S. monopolies.

The Common Market gradually reduces internal tariffs and expands internal trade; externally, it coordinates trade and tariff policies, strengthening the export of capital and goods, thus increasing its economic strength. From 1958 to 1965, the GDP of the Common Market countries increased by 45%, while the U.S. only increased by 37%. The total export value of the Common Market from 1958 to 1964 increased by 124%, while the U.S. only increased by 69%. The total gold reserves of the Common Market increased from $6.7 billion in 1958 to $15.1 billion by the end of September 1967, while the U.S.'s gold reserves decreased from $20.5 billion to $14.2 billion during the same period. After the devaluation of the pound, following several gold-buying frenzies, by late April this year, the U.S.'s gold reserves had fallen to $10.4 billion, while the Common Market's gold reserves had correspondingly increased. The total industrial output value of the Common Market is now equivalent to half of the U.S.'s, ranking second in the capitalist world. Within the imperialist bloc, the Common Market has become a formidable rival to the U.S. in economic, political, and military aspects, with increasingly sharp conflicts and struggles.

However, deep-seated conflicts also exist among the six countries of the Common Market due to political and economic interests. The U.S. often exploits these conflicts to isolate France, which is the most aggressive in challenging U.S. hegemony, attempting to dismantle the Common Market. The U.S.'s use of increased import taxes to pressure countries like West Germany is clearly aimed at provoking internal conflicts within the Common Market.

Some countries within the Common Market have a high proportion of goods and services exports in their GDP, such as 44% in the Netherlands, 36% in Belgium, and 21% in West Germany. These countries have significant exports to the U.S., and if the U.S. increases import tariffs, it will have a substantial impact on them. Under U.S. pressure and considering their own interests, West Germany has collaborated with Italy, the Netherlands, and other countries to propose that the Common Market unilaterally accelerate the implementation of the "Kennedy Round" agreement to prevent the U.S. from increasing import taxes, but this was opposed by France.

The so-called "Kennedy Round" negotiations were essentially the U.S.'s attempt to break down the tariff barriers of Western European countries and export more U.S. goods to Europe. After prolonged disputes, an agreement was barely signed last year. The agreement stipulates that starting from January 1, 1968, all parties will gradually reduce tariffs by 35% over five years. West Germany, due to its closer economic and political ties with the U.S. compared to other Common Market countries, is simultaneously using the Common Market to exclude the U.S. and expand its own influence, while also attempting to benefit from certain collaborations with the U.S. Therefore, when deciding on tariff reductions within the Common Market, West Germany proposed that the Common Market unilaterally accelerate the implementation of tax cuts, which objectively benefits the U.S. while disadvantaging the Common Market. France, of course, would not agree to this. Thus, the internal conflicts within the Common Market have deepened further.

However, West Germany and other countries also face growing conflicts with the U.S. West Germany and other countries export large quantities of chemicals to the U.S., but the U.S. adopts the "U.S. floor price" system for chemical imports, taxing based on domestic market prices rather than import prices to prevent foreign chemicals from competing with U.S. goods. This has long been a point of contention between West Germany and other countries with the U.S. During the "Kennedy Round" negotiations, the U.S. agreed to change this but has yet to implement it. Additionally, recently, when the U.S. Senate passed Johnson's tax bill, it included numerous riders, one of which stipulates quotas on the import of textiles, synthetic fibers, and dairy products. Some members of the U.S. Congress have proposed quotas on 75% of imported goods to reduce imports. If these proposals are implemented, the export trade of the Common Market will be significantly affected.

It is precisely due to these shared interests that, at the Luxembourg meeting where the Common Market discussed accelerating the implementation of the "Kennedy Round" agreement, the six countries, under France's insistence, unanimously decided to agree to advance several tax cuts and delay the U.S.'s first tax cut by one year, but with three conditions: first, the U.S. must not take protective measures on imports and exports; second, the U.S. Congress must pass a bill by January 1, 1969, to abolish the "U.S. floor price" system for imported chemicals; third, Japan, Canada, and the "European Free Trade Area" countries (the UK, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, and Portugal) must also advance tariff reductions. The Common Market's conditions for the U.S. are openly challenging the U.S. military. No wonder the New York Times said that this decision "sounds like an ultimatum."

The U.S., of course, will not accept this "ultimatum." The U.S. government immediately stated that it cannot accept the preconditions set by the Common Market. However, the chairman of the Common Market Commission, Rey, warned the U.S. that if the U.S. does not accept the six countries' decision, then the responsibility for triggering a trade war will lie with the U.S., not the six countries. The tense standoff between the two sides foreshadows an even more intense tariff and trade war brewing across the Atlantic.

The intensification of tariff and trade wars between imperialist powers will inevitably deepen the U.S.'s financial and economic crises. The U.S., in an attempt to reduce its trade deficit, had hoped that this year's trade surplus would reach $4.6 billion. However, the situation in the first three months of this year is quite dire. The trade surplus in January and February was more than halved compared to the same period last year, and March saw a trade deficit of over $150 million, the first such deficit in five years. The U.S.'s days ahead will be even more difficult. As the struggle of the world's revolutionary people against U.S. imperialism intensifies and imperialist contradictions deepen, U.S. imperialism will face even greater internal and external difficulties, becoming increasingly isolated and desperate, and falling into an unprecedented political and economic crisis, accelerating its demise.

### 帝国主义之间的关税战和贸易战

　　帝国主义之间的关税战和贸易战
    美帝国主义为了挽救它的金融危机和经济危机，力图把危机转嫁给西欧共同市场国家，这种做法自然要引起共同市场各国反抗，加剧帝国主义国家之间矛盾。最近美国和共同市场在关税问题上的斗争表明，继货币战之后，帝国主义之间的关税战和贸易战也将加剧。
    今年以来，约翰逊政府采取了一系列措施来减少美元外流，扩大出口。这些措施主要是针对共同市场国家的。例如限制私人资本向海外投资，就单单禁止对西欧共同市场国家增加任何投资。美国还多次派出大员到西欧去，设法扩大美国对西欧的出口。对于西德和法国实行有利于增加出口、限制进口的增值税，美国公开表示不满，并且扬言如果共同市场国家按计划都实行这种税制，美国就要增收进口税，来打击共同市场对美国的出口，进行报复。
    美国之所以对共同市场国家施加这样大的压力，是因为西欧是美国最大的投资市场和商品市场。据《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志估计，美国私人海外投资最多的地方是西欧，到一九六七年底共达一百七十五亿美元，其中约有一半，即八十三亿美元在共同市场国家。一九六六年，美国对西欧的出口，占美国出口总值的三分之一，而其中对共同市场的出口，又占一半以上。所以，美国力图从经济、政治、军事各方面牢牢控制西欧。而西欧国家虽然在战后初期不得不依赖美国来恢复自己的力量，却不甘心长期受美国的控制。在它们的经济力量相对增强，而美国的经济力量相对削弱以后，美国垄断资本同西欧垄断资本就展开了控制和反控制的斗争，激烈地争夺日益缩小的资本主义世界市场和西欧的霸权。一九五八年由法国、西德、意大利、荷兰、比利时、卢森堡六国组成的共同市场，就是西欧垄断资本同美国垄断资本进行斗争的一个工具。
    共同市场对内逐步削减关税，扩大内部的贸易；对外协调贸易和关税政策，加强资本和商品输出，它的经济实力日益增强。从一九五八年到一九六五年，共同市场国家的国民生产总值增加了百分之四十五，而美国只增加了百分之三十七。共同市场的出口总值，从一九五八年到一九六四年增加了百分之一百二十四，而美国只增加了百分之六十九。共同市场的黄金储备总额，从一九五八年的六十七亿美元增加到一九六七年九月底的一百五十一亿美元，而同期美国的黄金储备总额则从二百零五亿美元下降到一百四十二亿美元。在英镑贬值以后，经过几次黄金抢购风潮，到今年四月下旬，美国黄金储备降到了一百零四亿美元，而共同市场的黄金储备则又相应增加。共同市场的工业生产总值，现在已经相当于美国的一半，在资本主义世界中占第二位。在帝国主义集团内部，共同市场已经成为同美国争雄竞霸的劲敌。美国和共同市场之间，在经济、政治、军事各方面都存在着日益尖锐的矛盾和斗争。
    但是在共同市场六国之间，由于政治、经济的利害关系，也存在着深刻的矛盾。美国就经常利用这些矛盾，来孤立同美国争霸最厉害的法国，企图搞垮共同市场。美国用增加进口税来胁迫西德等国家，显然是抱有挑起共同市场内部矛盾的目的。
    共同市场中的一些国家，商品和劳务出口在它们的国民生产总值中所占的比例很大，例如在荷兰占百分之四十四，在比利时占百分之三十六，在西德占百分之二十一。这些国家对美国有大量出口，美国如果增加进口关税，对它们影响很大。西德在美国压力下，更出于本身利害的考虑，串连意大利、荷兰等国家提出共同市场单方面加速实施“肯尼迪回合”协定，来换取美国不增加进口税，但是遭到法国的反对。
    所谓“肯尼迪回合”谈判，实际上就是美国要打破西欧国家的关税壁垒，向西欧更多地出口美国商品。所以，双方经过长期争吵，才在去年勉强签订了协定。协定规定，从今年一月一日起，各方在五年之内，分期分批削减关税百分之三十五。西德由于它同美国在经济和政治上联系比其他共同市场国家为紧，它在加紧利用共同市场排挤美国、扩展自己势力的同时，又企图利用同美国某些方面的勾结捞取好处。因此在决定共同市场削减关税时，西德又提出共同市场单方面加速实行减税，这客观上将使美国从中得到好处，而让共同市场吃亏。法国当然不肯答应。这样，共同市场内部的矛盾就进一步加深了。
    但是，西德等国家同美国之间也存在着日益增长的矛盾。西德等国向美国出口大宗化学品，而美国为了使外国化学品不能同美国货进行竞争，对化学品的进口税采取“美国底价”制度，不按进口价格而按美国国内的市场价格征税。这一直是西德等国同美国之间争吵的问题。在“肯尼迪回合”谈判中美国曾经答应改变，但一直没有实现。此外，最近美国参议院通过约翰逊的增税法案的时候，提出了一大堆附款，其中规定对毛织品、人造织品和乳制品的进口要实行限额制度。美国国会中还有人提议，要对百分之七十五的进口商品实行限额制度，来减少进口。如果这些主张得到实现，共同市场的出口贸易就将受到很大的影响。
    正是由于这种利害上的一致，在共同市场讨论加速实施“肯尼迪回合”协定问题的卢森堡会议上，六国在法国坚持下一致决定，同意提前实施几次减税，并且让美国的第一次减税推迟一年，但是有三个条件：第一，美国不得对进出口采取保护性措施；第二、美国国会必须在明年一月一日以前通过一项法案，取消对进口化学品的“美国底价”制度；第三，日本、加拿大、和“欧洲自由贸易区”国家（英国、丹麦、挪威、瑞典、瑞士、奥地利、葡萄牙等）也必须提前削减关税。共同市场对美国提出的条件，是公开将美国的军。无怪乎《纽约时报》说，这个决定“听来象是个最后通牒”。
    美国当然不肯接受这个“最后通牒”。美国官方马上就表示，共同市场提出的先决条件，它不能接受。而共同市场委员会主席雷伊则警告美国说，如果美国不接受六国的决定，那末爆发一场贸易战的责任就不在六国而在美国。双方这副剑拔弩张架势，预告着一场更激烈的关税战和贸易战就将在大西洋两岸展开。
    帝国主义之间关税战、贸易战的加剧，必将加深美国的金融危机和经济危机。美国为了减少国际收支逆差，原来指望今年的对外贸易盈余能够达到四十六亿美元，但是今年头三个月的情况却十分不妙。一、二月份的贸易顺差比去年同期减少一半以上，三月份更出现了五年来没有过的数达一亿五千多万美元的贸易逆差。今后美国的日子将还要难过。随着世界革命人民反对美帝国主义的斗争的进一步高涨，和帝国主义矛盾的加剧，美帝国主义必将更加内外交困，走投无路，陷入空前严重的政治危机和经济危机，使它的灭亡加速到来。
