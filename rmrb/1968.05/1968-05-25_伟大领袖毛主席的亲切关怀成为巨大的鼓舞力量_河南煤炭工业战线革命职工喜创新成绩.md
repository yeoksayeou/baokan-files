Under the great inspiration of the warm care of the great leader Chairman Mao for the revolutionary miners across the country, the broad revolutionary miners on the coal industry front in Henan Province have launched a new high tide of seizing the revolution and promoting production.

On the first day the news of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin receiving the revolutionary worker representatives attending the conference on revolution and production in coal mines and more than twenty thousand revolutionary soldiers from all over the country reached Henan, the twenty-five coal mines under the five coal mining bureaus directly under the Ministry of Coal in Pingdingshan, Jiaozuo, and Hubei, as well as the provincial coal mines in Xinmi, Yima, and Anyang, all exceeded the state production plan for the day's raw coal in the province. The Pingdingshan Coal Mining Bureau's daily output increased by more than one and a half times compared to usual. Since entering May, Henan's coal production has seen a significant increase. By May 21st, the average daily output of the five coal mining bureaus increased by 36.3% compared to April, with Jiaozuo and Hubei coal mining bureaus both exceeding the production plan for the first and second ten days of May.

On the night of May 20th, after the coal mine workers' representatives in Beijing conveyed the great news of Chairman Mao's reception to the various coal mines in Henan, the mining areas were filled with joy. The various levels of revolutionary committees and the supporting leftist units of the People's Liberation Army in the Pingdingshan mining area organized forty-five Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams overnight to spread the good news to the underground and workers' dormitory areas as quickly as possible. In an instant, tens of thousands of revolutionary miners shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" Many miners, with tears of joy, held the red revolutionary book "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," and stood together in front of Chairman Mao's portrait to swear, "Loyal to Chairman Mao with all our hearts, until the seas dry up and the stones crumble. We will always follow Chairman Mao's words, follow Chairman Mao through the waves of class struggle, seize the revolution, vigorously promote production, and report excellent results to Chairman Mao!" On May 21st, more than twenty thousand revolutionary workers in Pingdingshan held a rally to swear to seize the revolution and promote production, resolutely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. On May 21st, after the workers of the 143 mining team of Pingdingshan Mine No. 10 went down the mine, they encountered three roof collapses totaling eleven meters long. They chanted together, "Resolutely carry out the decision, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," a quote from Chairman Mao, overcame the difficulties, quickly stopped the roof collapse, and produced more than nine hundred tons of coal in that shift, doubling the usual daily output.

The broad revolutionary workers in Pingdingshan, Jiaozuo, and Hubei mines insist on going down the mine to do a good job in production and, after coming up, carry out revolutionary criticism in groups such as coal mining teams, excavation teams, or shifts, fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, and closely linking revolutionary criticism with the struggle against the rightist reversal wind. The various mines under the Jiaozuo Coal Mining Bureau, armed with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have launched a fierce class struggle, unearthed a batch of hidden traitors, spies, and remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and rapidly changed the revolutionary and production situation in the Jiaozuo mining area. Now, the revolutionary criticism is booming, and coal production has risen significantly.

Under the great inspiration of the news of Chairman Mao receiving the revolutionary worker representatives at the conference on revolution and production in coal mines, the broad revolutionary miners on the coal industry front in Henan are advancing with victory, determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end and turn the various coal mines in Henan into red Mao Zedong Thought schools.

    伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀成为巨大的鼓舞力量
    河南煤炭工业战线革命职工喜创新成绩
    新华社郑州二十三日电　在伟大领袖毛主席对全国煤矿革命矿工亲切关怀的巨大鼓舞下，河南全省煤炭工业战线上的广大革命矿工，掀起了抓革命促生产的新高潮。
    毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席接见出席煤矿抓革命、促生产会议革命职工代表以及来自全国各地两万多名革命战士的喜讯传来的第一天，河南平顶山、焦作、鹤壁等五个煤炭部直属矿务局所属的二十五个煤矿，以及新密、义马、安阳等省属煤矿，总计超额完成了全省当天原煤生产的国家计划。平顶山矿务局比平时日产量猛增一倍半还多。进入五月以来，河南的煤炭生产有了较大幅度的上升。到二十一日止，五个矿务局平均日产水平比四月份提高百分之三十六点三，其中，焦作和鹤壁两个矿务局都超额完成了五月上旬和中旬的生产计划。
    五月二十日深夜，当在北京开会的煤矿职工代表把伟大领袖毛主席接见的特大喜讯传到河南各煤矿以后，各矿区一片欢腾。平顶山矿区各级革委会和驻矿人民解放军支左部队，连夜组织了四十五个毛泽东思想宣传队，以最快的速度把喜讯传遍井下和工人宿舍区。顷刻之间，几万革命矿工迸发出同一个声音：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”许多矿工含着幸福的泪花，手捧红彤彤的革命宝书《毛主席语录》，一起站在毛主席像前宣誓：“一心忠于毛主席，海枯石烂不变心。我们要永远听毛主席的话，跟着毛主席迎着阶级斗争风浪走，抓好革命，猛促生产，用优异的成绩向毛主席报喜！”平顶山二十一日有两万多名革命职工举行抓革命、促生产誓师大会，坚决表示要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。平顶山十矿一四三采煤班工人二十一日下井后，碰到三处冒顶长达十一米，他们齐声朗诵“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的毛主席语录，克服困难，很快刹住了冒顶，并在当班又出煤九百多吨，比平时日产水平增加了一倍。
    平顶山、焦作、鹤壁等各矿广大革命职工，坚持下井搞好生产，上井后就以采煤队、掘井队或班组为单位开展革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，并且把革命大批判和反击右倾翻案妖风紧密结合起来。焦作矿务局所属各矿，广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众在毛主席最新指示武装下，狠抓阶级斗争，挖出了一批隐藏的叛徒、特务等国民党反动派残渣余孽，使焦作矿区革命和生产的面貌迅速改观。现在，这个矿革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈，煤炭生产大幅度上升。
    河南煤炭工业战线广大革命矿工在毛主席接见煤矿抓革命、促生产会议革命职工代表这一特大喜讯的鼓舞下，正在乘胜前进，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把河南各煤矿办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
