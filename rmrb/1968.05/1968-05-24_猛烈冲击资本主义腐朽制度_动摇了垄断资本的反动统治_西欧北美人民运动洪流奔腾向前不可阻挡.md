The torrent of people's movements in Western Europe and North America is surging forward, unstoppable. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has accelerated the spread of Mao Zedong Thought in Western Europe and North America, providing new inspiration and strength to the people of Western Europe and North America. Our era is one of the comprehensive collapse of imperialism and the global victory of socialism. The revolutionary movements of the people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are flourishing. The broad masses of people in Western Europe and North America are also rapidly awakening and rising up to oppose the reactionary rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie. In the major capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, and Italy, the surging workers' movements, student movements, people's movements against the U.S. aggression in Vietnam, and the struggles of African Americans against violence, are converging into a surging tide, powerfully impacting the decaying capitalist system and shaking the reactionary rule of the international monopoly bourgeoisie.

The surge in people's movements in Western Europe and North America is a major symbol of the deepening of the general crisis of capitalism, the intensification of the great upheaval, great division, and great reorganization within the capitalist world, and the inevitable result of the intensification of class contradictions within each capitalist country.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has accelerated the spread of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in Western Europe and North America, providing new inspiration and strength to the awakening people of Western Europe and North America. Now, in this region, more and more revolutionary people are holding up the portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao in their struggles, seriously studying the works of Chairman Mao and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and striving to combine Mao Zedong Thought with the local situation.

The great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, pointed out: "The proletariat and working people of Europe, North America, and Oceania are in a new awakening. The U.S. imperialists and all other harmful elements have already prepared their own gravediggers, and their days of being buried will not be long." Now, the surging revolutionary struggles of the people of Western Europe and North America once again prove the correctness of Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment.

The main force of the working class is fighting bravely

The monopoly capitalist groups of the imperialist countries, in order to save their increasingly serious political and economic crises, have intensified their attacks on the broad masses of laborers, which inevitably provokes stronger resistance from the people. The working class, as the main force of the people's movements in Western Europe and North America, has risen up to fight.

The broad masses of workers in the number one imperialist country, the United States, have defied the threats of the reactionary authorities and the suppression of the yellow union leaders, launching wave after wave of strikes. Since the second half of last year, a series of nationwide strikes have broken out in the United States. The nationwide strike of more than 60,000 copper workers that began in July last year lasted for nine months. At the same time, the nationwide strike of railway machinery workers paralyzed more than 95% of U.S. rail transportation. Recently, more than 200,000 telecommunications workers held their first nationwide strike in 21 years. Tens of thousands of teachers across the country have broken through various legal restrictions to launch an unprecedented scale of strike actions, forcing many schools to suspend classes. According to the official statistics of the United States, which have been reduced, there were 1,130 strikes in the first three months of this year, involving 573,300 workers, reaching the highest peak of strike struggles in the first quarter since 1950, causing significant losses to the U.S. economy. The strikes of copper, railway, shipbuilding, and rubber workers even affected the production and supply of war materials for the aggression in Vietnam, causing more difficulties for the U.S. imperialists who have suffered repeated defeats in the aggression in Vietnam.

In France, the monopoly capitalists have intensified the transfer of economic difficulties to the laborers, causing prices to rise continuously and unemployment to surge, making the lives of laborers increasingly difficult. The French workers have accumulated immense resentment. Recently, under the inspiration of the fiery student movement, the French working class, with a long tradition of struggle, has launched a magnificent political and economic general strike. The strike wave swept across more than 90 provinces in just a few days, with more than 8 million people participating in the strike, and the number is still increasing. The actions of the workers have paralyzed France's transportation, communications, postal services, and a large part of industrial and mining enterprises, dealing a severe blow to the entire French monopoly group.

In the struggle, the striking workers have displayed the courage to fight and rebel, taking fierce battle actions, occupying factories, and locking up bosses. By the 21st, workers had occupied more than 300 important factories and mines, fully demonstrating the fighting strength of the French working class.

The resistance of the British working class is also becoming stronger. More than 16,000 dock workers went on strike for more than two months at the end of last year, seriously affecting the import and export trade, which is the lifeline of the British economy. Steel, automobile, railway, seafarer, printing, and bank employees have also carried out various forms of strike struggles. Currently, the bus drivers in several dozen cities who have been on strike since last October to demand wage increases are still continuing. The recent nationwide strike of 3 million mechanical workers has also seriously affected the production of automobiles, machinery manufacturing, metal, shipbuilding, aircraft, and other industries in Britain.

In other capitalist countries, the struggles of the working class against the brutal exploitation of monopoly capital are also developing. Last year, 742 factories in West Germany went on strike. In Italy, 400,000 textile workers went on strike six times nationwide last year, and 350,000 woodworkers went on strike five times nationwide. Even under the dictatorship of Franco in Spain, workers have defied government bans and gone on strike repeatedly, and have even raised the slogan of overthrowing the Franco fascist regime.

The student movement is surging and shaking the old world

The vast number of young students in Western Europe and North America are fighting bravely to oppose the decadent bourgeois education system, to demand democratic rights, and to oppose the aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism and the reactionary ruling groups of their own countries. The rapidly developing progressive student movement is like a thunderous spring thunder, strongly shaking the decadent and declining entire capitalist world.

The recent student struggles in Western Europe and North America have almost swept across the major capitalist countries of the United States, France, West Germany, Italy, and others, with unprecedented scale; the student movement's struggle targets are clearly aimed at the number one enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism, and the reactionary rule of monopoly capital in each country, and the students have put forward slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Oppose the suppression of the bourgeois state machine!" "Use revolutionary violence to oppose bourgeois violence!" and other fighting slogans.

This student movement has broken away from the traditional methods of sit-ins and petitions, and has used brave resistance actions to challenge the capitalist state machine heroically. Students have taken to the streets with red flags, gone on strike, demonstrated, occupied schools, and engaged in fierce battles with reactionary military police, showing great courage and tenacity. It is particularly worth noting that the student movement in Western Europe and North America is beginning to take the path of combining with the workers' movement, which is an extremely important new development in the people's movements of capitalist countries. It will surely promote the further surge of the people's movements in Western Europe and North America.

This year, the student movement in the United States has seen an unprecedented new high tide. To oppose racial discrimination, oppose the aggression in Vietnam, and demand democratic rights, more than 100 schools in the United States have seen strikes and demonstrations. In mid-March, a massive strike involving tens of thousands of Mexican, Black, and white students took place in Los Angeles. In late April, a strike involving hundreds of thousands of people against the aggression in Vietnam swept through Washington, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and many other major cities, involving dozens of colleges and universities and many high schools. At the end of April, the strike at Columbia University in the United States, which shocked the nation, is still ongoing. Currently, the progressive student movement in the United States is still continuing to develop.

The student movement in France has developed particularly rapidly, sweeping through major cities across the country. Since May 3, the number of students demonstrating in Paris has increased from thousands to tens of thousands in just a week, forming a demonstration of 800,000 students, teachers, and workers, the largest since World War II. Students have fought bravely with reactionary military police for eight consecutive days, turning the Paris University area into a battlefield filled with gunpowder. French students have also defied government threats and intimidation, occupying school buildings and dean's offices, and establishing "occupation committees" in 18 universities across the country, with students managing the schools themselves.

The progressive student movements in West Germany and Italy are also flourishing. This year, the scale and momentum of the struggles of German students have been unprecedented, and they have put forward more fighting slogans. They have held demonstrations involving tens of thousands of people in more than 500 towns and cities, and together with workers and peasants, held a historic rally of 60,000 people in the West German capital of Bonn. The student movement in Italy has also rapidly developed to Rome, Milan, and dozens of other cities in just a few months.

In addition, students in Britain, Spain, Belgium, and usually quiet countries like Switzerland, Denmark, and Sweden have also taken up the struggle.

The anti-U.S. imperialism in Vietnam surges through Europe and America

The people's struggles in Western Europe and North America against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam are surging, becoming a major current in the people's movements in Western Europe and North America.

Since this year, the people of various cities in the United States have repeatedly launched waves of demonstrations against the aggression in Vietnam. In late April, the people of the United States launched a wave of demonstrations against the aggression in Vietnam that swept through Washington, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and other major cities, involving hundreds of thousands of people. More and more workers, students, teachers, scientists, writers, lawyers, women, and people from various strata are actively participating in this struggle in various ways. They distribute leaflets, hold protest meetings and demonstrations, surround recruitment centers, and burn recruitment certificates.

The anti-war movement among American youth is developing extremely rapidly. The U.S. government admits that last year about 1,000 American youth burned their recruitment certificates and refused to be cannon fodder for U.S. imperialism; and on May 17 this year alone, 866 young students at the University of California publicly swore not to fight for the U.S. aggression in Vietnam. In many universities, young students also oppose the school authorities' evil collusion with the "Institute for Defense Analyses," the "Central Intelligence Agency," and the "Dow Chemical Company" and other agencies involved in the aggression in Vietnam. In the recent waves of struggle, students in several colleges have also taken the heroic action of burning the buildings of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps.

The rapid development of the anti-war movement among U.S. soldiers has seriously weakened the combat effectiveness of the U.S. military and affected the operation of the U.S. imperialist war machine. On May 21, the U.S. Department of Defense had to admit that in the past two years, the various types of deserters in the U.S. forces have totaled about 190,000. In addition, anti-war activities among U.S. soldiers are becoming more and more active. On October 3 last year, several hundred soldiers of the 193rd Infantry Brigade in the U.S. First Army mutinied in Hood Fort, Texas, and refused to go to South Vietnam. In April this year, a squad of soldiers about to go to the battlefield in Vietnam mutinied at Campbell Fort in Kentucky.

Opposing U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam and supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle for national liberation is also an important part of the currently flourishing people's movements in Western Europe. Since this year, large-scale demonstrations against U.S. aggression in Vietnam have broken out in West Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Sweden, and other countries; in mid-April, the unprecedented scale of demonstrations in more than 500 towns and cities in West Germany, involving more than 300,000 residents, clearly directed the struggle at U.S. imperialism. West German youth have repeatedly surrounded and stormed the "American House," the U.S. consulate, and the U.S. military headquarters and other institutions; the youth in the port of Bremen even tore down the U.S. military headquarters' stars and stripes and hung up a red flag. On March 17, more than 10,000 people demonstrated in London, Britain, surrounding the U.S. embassy, shouting "Down with U.S. imperialism!" and throwing stones at the U.S. embassy, burning the U.S. stars and stripes, and engaging in fierce battles with the police who came to suppress them. In addition, the struggles against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam in France, Italy, Sweden, Spain, and other capitalist countries are also continuous, one after another.

The black people's struggle against violence heavily strikes the U.S.

In recent years, the black people's struggle against violence in the United States has developed rapidly, which is an important sign of the rapid awakening of the people in Western Europe and North America. The more than 20 million black people in the United States, who have suffered from class and national oppression and exploitation, have raised the banner of revolutionary rebellion in the heartland of U.S. imperialism to fight for survival and liberation, openly challenging U.S. imperialism's "law" and "order," and strongly shaking the reactionary rule of U.S. imperialism at home.

The new wave of black people's struggle against violence that broke out in early April this year was unprecedentedly fierce, sweeping across nearly 170 large and small cities in the United States in just ten days, dealing an unprecedented heavy blow to the U.S. ruling class.

The broad masses of black people (especially black youth) have joined the struggle against violence with deep hatred for racial oppression and exploitation. They have taken up all kinds of weapons they can get their hands on, from bricks, stones, and glass bottles to long and short guns, severely punishing the fascist military police who are madly suppressing blacks. Black snipers have played an increasingly important role in the struggle against violence, making the reactionary military police run around in circles and look ridiculous. In the flames of revenge lit by the black masses, the shops and houses of white exploiters have been reduced to ashes in patches. Wave after wave of large-scale struggles against violence has tempered the broad masses of black people, making them more and more aware of their own strength and their fighting spirit more and more high.

In recent years, major U.S. industrial and commercial centers such as New York, Los Angeles, Detroit, and Chicago have all suffered heavy blows from the black people's struggle against violence, and the U.S. imperialist stronghold of Washington has been the center of the struggle against violence this year. The rebellious actions of the black masses have dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. ruling class, both economically and, more importantly, politically, exposing the paper tiger nature of U.S. imperialism to the people of the world.

Facing the increasingly fierce flames of the black people's struggle against violence, the U.S. ruling class is terrified and enraged. They no longer care about the "democracy" and "freedom" facade and are increasingly openly implementing fascist suppression, trying to drown the black people's struggle against violence in a sea of blood.

However, the awakening black people in the United States are not suppressed by any violence of the U.S. reactionaries. As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "Among the more than 20 million black people in the United States, there is an extremely powerful revolutionary force." They will ultimately, with the support of the revolutionary people of the world, fight side by side with the white working people in the United States and finally bury U.S. imperialism and achieve their own complete liberation.

    猛烈冲击资本主义腐朽制度　动摇了垄断资本的反动统治
    西欧北美人民运动洪流奔腾向前不可阻挡
    中国文化大革命加速了毛泽东思想在西欧北美的传播，给西欧北美人民以新的鼓舞和力量
    我们的时代是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的革命运动正在蓬勃发展，西欧、北美的广大人民群众也正在加速觉醒，奋起反对垄断资产阶级的反动统治。美国、英国、法国、西德和意大利等主要资本主义国家中不断高涨的工人运动、学生运动、人民反对美国侵越战争的运动和美国黑人抗暴斗争，正汇成一股汹涌澎湃的洪流，猛烈地冲击着腐朽的资本主义制度，动摇了国际垄断资产阶级的反动统治。
    西欧、北美人民运动的高涨，是资本主义总危机不断加深的情况下，资本主义世界内部大动荡、大分化、大改组更加深刻剧烈的一个重大象征，是各资本主义国家内部阶级矛盾日益激化的必然结果。
    史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，加速了战无不胜的毛泽东思想在西欧、北美地区的传播，给了正在觉醒的西欧、北美人民以新的鼓舞和力量。现在，在这个地区，越来越多的革命人民在斗争中举起伟大领袖毛主席的画像，认真学习毛主席著作和《毛主席语录》，并且正在努力把毛泽东思想同当地的实际情况结合起来。
    无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席指出：“欧洲、北美和大洋洲的无产阶级和劳动人民，正处在新的觉醒之中。美帝国主义和其他一切害人虫已经准备好了自己的掘墓人，他们被埋葬的日子不会太长了。”现在，西欧、北美人民蓬勃高涨的革命斗争，再一次证实了毛主席的这一英明论断。
    工人阶级主力军奋起战斗
    帝国主义国家的垄断资本集团为了挽救它们日益严重的政治危机和经济危机，变本加厉地进攻广大劳动人民，这就必然要激起人民更强烈的反抗。作为西欧、北美人民运动主力军的工人阶级，纷纷奋起战斗了。
    头号帝国主义国家美国的广大工人群众，不顾反动当局的威胁，不顾黄色工会头子的压制，掀起了一次又一次的罢工浪潮。自从去年下半年以来，美国相继爆发了多起全国性罢工。去年七月开始的六万多铜业工人大罢工坚持了九个月之久。与此同时爆发的铁路机械工人全国性罢工使得美国百分之九十五以上的铁路运输陷于瘫痪。二十多万电讯工人不久前又举行了二十一年来的第一次全国范围大罢工。全国各地成千上万的教师也冲破种种法令的束缚，掀起了历史上空前规模的罢教斗争，迫使许多学校停课。根据美国官方的缩小了的统计数字，今年头三个月，美国共爆发了一千一百三十次罢工，参加罢工的工人共五十七万三千人，达到了一九五○年以来第一季度罢工斗争的最高峰，使美国经济遭到了重大损失。铜业、铁路、造船和橡胶工人的罢工甚至影响了侵越战争物资的生产和供应，给在侵越战争中连遭惨败的美帝国主义造成更多的困难。
    在法国，垄断资本加紧向劳动人民转嫁经济困难，使物价不断上涨、失业猛增，劳动人民的生活越来越困难。法国工人心中郁积着巨大的愤懑。最近，在如火如荼的学生运动的激发下，有着悠久斗争传统的法国工人阶级掀起了轰轰烈烈的政治、经济大罢工。罢工浪潮在短短几天内就席卷了全国九十多个省，参加罢工的人数已超过八百万，目前还在不断增加。工人的行动使法国的交通、运输、邮电和很大一部分工矿企业陷于瘫痪，使整个法国垄断集团遭到严重打击。
    在斗争中，罢工工人发扬敢于斗争、敢于造反的英勇气概，采取激烈的战斗行动，纷纷占领工厂，禁闭老板。到二十一日为止，工人已经占领了三百多个重要厂矿，充分显示了法国工人阶级的战斗力量。
    英国工人阶级的反抗也日益强烈。一万六千多名码头工人去年年底坚持了两个多月的罢工，严重影响了作为英国经济生命线的进出口贸易。钢铁、汽车工人，铁路工人、海员、印刷工人、银行雇员也进行了各种形式的罢工斗争。目前，几十个城市的公共汽车司机从去年十月开始的要求增加工资的罢工还在继续。而刚刚举行过的三百万机械工人大罢工，又严重影响了英国的汽车、机器制造、五金、造船、飞机等工业的生产。
    在其他资本主义国家，工人阶级反对垄断资本残酷剥削的斗争也不断发展。西德去年有七百四十二个工厂的工人举行了罢工。意大利四十万纺织工人去年举行了六次全国性罢工，三十五万木材工人举行了五次全国性罢工。甚至在佛朗哥独裁政权统治下的西班牙，工人们也不顾政府种种禁令，不断举行罢工，而且还提出推翻佛朗哥法西斯政权的口号。
    学生运动猛烈兴起震荡旧世界
    西欧、北美的广大青年学生为反对腐朽的资产阶级教育制度，争取民主权利，反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和本国的反动统治集团展开了英勇的斗争。迅猛异常的进步学生运动，象响亮的春雷，强烈地震动着腐朽、没落的整个资本主义世界。
    西欧、北美学生最近掀起的斗争几乎席卷美国、法国、西德、意大利等西欧北美的主要资本主义国家，规模空前；学生运动的斗争矛头，都明确地指向世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义和各国垄断资本的反动统治，学生们提出了“打倒美帝国主义！”
  “反对资产阶级国家机器的镇压！”“以革命的暴力反对资产阶级的暴力！”等富有战斗性的口号。
    这次学生运动打破了过去静坐、请愿等传统方式，而用勇敢的反抗行动，向资本主义国家机器展开了英雄的挑战，学生们打着红旗走上街头，罢课示威，占领学校，同反动军警进行了激烈的搏斗，表现十分英勇顽强。特别值得指出的是，西欧、北美的学生运动正在开始走上和工人运动相结合的道路，这是资本主义国家人民运动中一个极其重要的新发展，它必将推动西欧、北美的人民运动的进一步高涨。
    今年来，美国学生运动出现了前所未有的新高潮。为了反对种族歧视，反对侵越战争，要求民主权利，美国已有一百多所学校爆发了罢课和游行示威。三月中旬在美国洛杉矶爆发了有几万墨西哥族学生、黑人学生和白人学生共同参加的大罢课。四月下旬，有几十万人参加的反对侵越战争的大罢课，席卷了华盛顿、纽约、芝加哥、旧金山等许多大城市的几十所大专院校和许多中学，四月底，美国哥伦比亚大学学生举行的震动全国的大罢课，迄今还未结束。目前，美国进步学生运动还在继续向前发展。
    法国的学生运动发展得尤其迅猛，它已经席卷了全国各大城市。从五月三日开始的短短一周内，巴黎上街示威的学生就从数千人增加到数万人，到十三日形成了学生、教师和工人八十万人联合举行的法国第二次世界大战以来规模最大的群众示威。学生们在斗争中同反动军警进行了连续八天的英勇搏斗，使巴黎大学区成了硝烟弥漫的战场。法国学生还不顾政府的恐吓、威胁，占领学校大楼、校长办公室，全国十八所大学都成立了“占领委员会”，由学生自己管理学校。
    西德、意大利的进步学生运动也在蓬勃发展。今年来，西德学生的斗争不仅规模和声势空前，而且提出了更富有战斗性的口号。他们在五百多个城镇举行了有数十万人参加的游行示威，并同工人、农民一起，在西德首都波恩举行了西德历史上空前的六万人群众大会。意大利的学生运动在最近短短几个月中也迅速发展到罗马、米兰等几十个城市。
    此外，英国、西班牙、比利时以及通常学生运动比较沉寂的瑞士、丹麦和瑞典，学生们也纷纷开展斗争。
    反对美帝侵越怒涛席卷欧美
    西欧、北美人民反对美帝国主义侵越战争的斗争正在不断高涨，成为西欧、北美人民运动的一股巨流。
    今年以来，美国各城市的人民群众不断掀起一次又一次的反对侵越战争的示威游行。四月下旬，美国人民掀起了一个席卷华盛顿、纽约、芝加哥、旧金山等各大城市的，有几十万人参加的反对侵越战争的高潮。越来越多的工人、学生、教员、科学家、作家、律师、妇女等各阶层的人民群众，用各种方式积极参加了这个斗争。他们散发传单，举行抗议集会和游行，包围征兵中心，焚毁征兵证。
    反对侵越战争的斗争在美国青年中发展得极为迅速。美国官方承认，去年约有一千名美国青年烧毁了自己的征兵证，拒绝替美帝国主义充当炮灰；而今年五月十七日一天内，在加利福尼亚大学就有八百六十六名青年学生当众宣誓，决不为美帝侵越战争卖命。在许多大学里，青年学生还反对学校当局同“国防分析研究所”、“中央情报局”、“道氏化学公司”等侵越机构、特务机构进行罪恶勾结。在最近几次斗争高潮中，在几个学院里，还发生了学生烧掉预备军官训练队的建筑物的英勇行动。
    美国士兵中反对侵越战争运动的迅速发展，严重地削弱了美国军队的战斗力，影响了美帝国主义战争机器的运转。五月二十一日，美国国防部不得不承认，两年来美国部队中的各种各样的逃兵，约达十九万之多。此外，美国军队中士兵的反战活动也越来越活跃。去年十月三日，美国第一百九十三步兵旅的数百名士兵，曾在得克萨斯州胡德堡举行暴动，拒绝开赴南越。今年四月，在肯塔基州的坎贝尔堡基地，一队即将开赴侵越战场的士兵，又举行了暴动。
    反对美帝国主义侵越战争，支持越南人民抗美救国斗争，也是当前蓬勃发展中的西欧人民运动的一个重要内容。今年以来，在西德、英国、法国、意大利、瑞典等国家，不断爆发大规模的反对美国侵略越南的示威游行；四月中旬，西德五百多城镇三十多万居民掀起的空前规模大示威，把斗争矛头明确指向美帝国主义。西德青年曾数次包围和冲击了“美国之家”、美国领事馆、美军总部等机构；不来梅港的青年还撕下了美国驻军总部的星条旗，在这个建筑物上挂起了红旗。三月十七日在英国伦敦也爆发了一万多人的反美大示威，示威群众包围了美国大使馆，高呼“打倒美帝国主义”的口号，向美国大使馆扔石头，烧毁了美国星条旗，并同前来镇压的警察进行激烈搏斗。此外，法国、意大利、瑞典、西班牙等其他资本主义国家的反对美帝侵略越南的斗争，也连绵不断，此伏彼起。
    黑人抗暴斗争沉重打击美帝
    近年来美国黑人抗暴斗争如火如荼的发展，是西欧、北美人民加速觉醒的一个重要标志。饱受阶级和民族双重压迫和剥削的美国两千多万黑人群众，为了争生存、求解放，在美帝国主义的心脏地区举起了革命造反的大旗，向美帝国主义的“法律”和“秩序”进行公开的挑战，强烈地震动了帝国主义头子美帝国主义在国内的反动统治。
    今年四月初爆发的黑人抗暴斗争新风暴，来势空前迅猛，在短短十天里就席卷了近一百七十个美国大小城市，给了美国统治集团以空前沉重的打击。
    广大黑人群众（特别是黑人青年）怀着对种族主义压迫和剥削的深仇大恨投入抗暴斗争。他们拿起各种能够到手的武器，从砖头、石块、玻璃瓶到长短枪支，狠狠惩罚疯狂镇压黑人的法西斯军警。黑人狙击手在抗暴斗争中起了越来越重要的作用，打得反动军警疲于奔命，狼狈不堪。在黑人群众点燃的复仇烈焰中，白人剥削者的商店和房屋成片成片地化成了灰烬。一次又一次大规模抗暴斗争的烈火，使广大黑人群众受到了有益的锻炼，使他们越来越意识到自己的力量，斗志越发高昂。
    美国一系列重要工商业中心：纽约、洛杉矶、底特律、芝加哥……近年来都先后遭到了黑人抗暴斗争的沉重打击，而美帝老巢华盛顿更是今年抗暴斗争的风暴中心。黑人群众的造反行动使美国统治集团不仅在经济上，而且更重要的在政治上遭到极大的打击，在全世界人民面前暴露了美帝国主义外强中干的纸老虎本质。
    面对着越烧越旺的黑人抗暴斗争烈火，美国统治集团怕得要死，恨得要命。他们再也顾不得什么“民主”、“自由”的伪装，越来越赤裸裸地实行法西斯镇压，妄想把黑人抗暴斗争淹没在血泊中。
    但是，日益觉醒的美国黑人是美国反动派的任何暴力所压服不了的。正如我们的伟大领袖毛主席所指出的那样，“在两千多万美国黑人中，蕴藏着极其强大的革命力量。”他们终将在全世界革命人民的支持下，同美国白人劳动群众并肩战斗，最终埋葬美国帝国主义，获得自己的彻底解放。
