	Xinhua News Agency, May 7th: Revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of revolutionary people across the country, with deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, are solemnly commemorating the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive, which has great historical and strategic significance. Hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses have expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to advance along the glorious path of Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive, to further implement Chairman Mao's latest series of directives, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and to transform the entire country into a blazing red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

	Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive and in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great motherland has undergone earth-shaking changes. Great Mao Zedong Thought has been widely propagated, and the ideological revolutionization of the people of the entire nation has reached a new height. Revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of revolutionary people in various places, in the midst of an unprecedented excellent situation commemorating the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive, have deeply felt that Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive is a great program for building socialism. Chairman Mao's brilliant directive is a powerful ideological weapon for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary masses in various places have expressed their determination to better study and implement Chairman Mao's great directive and his latest series of directives, to advance with the momentum, to develop the excellent situation, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	In Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other major cities, and in the provincial capitals and autonomous region capitals of Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Guizhou, Sichuan, Yunnan, Fujian, Xinjiang, and Tibet, as well as in the vast cities and countryside across the country, factories, enterprises, institutions, schools, and rural people's communes have held meetings in recent days to solemnly commemorate the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive. Many places have held large-scale mass rallies. Revolutionary committee leaders and military leaders from many provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions attended the local commemorative meetings and delivered speeches. At various meetings, the broad revolutionary masses unanimously toasted our red sun, Chairman Mao, with long life! Long life! They repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

	Chairman Mao teaches us that soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, workers, peasants, students, and personnel in commerce, services, and party and government organs must all "criticize the bourgeoisie." Revolutionary masses in various places have decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to push the revolutionary criticism and struggle to a new high, and to do a good job of criticism, struggle, and reform in each unit. Revolutionary workers in the capital's industrial and mining enterprises, commerce, and service industries, poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburban people's communes, and revolutionary Red Guards in primary and secondary schools pointed out at their commemorative meetings that Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive is both a weapon and a direction for criticism, struggle, and reform. We must follow Chairman Mao's programmatic directive for building socialism, carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism and struggle, and do a good job of criticism, struggle, and reform in our own units. Many poor and lower-middle peasants said that Chairman Mao instructs us peasants to "criticize the bourgeoisie," which is a major task for building our socialist country into an iron fortress. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to launch a fierce attack on the representatives of the bourgeoisie, continuously exposing and criticizing the heinous crimes of the capitalist restoration by Liu Shaoqi and other top renegades, traitors, and scabs within the party and their agents, consolidating and developing the socialist collective economy, and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must follow Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive, carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism and struggle, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Representatives of advanced units in various industries in Shanghai held a symposium at the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee to exchange experiences in implementing Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive over the past two years, carrying out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism and struggle, and conducting criticism, struggle, and reform in their own units. Revolutionary young soldiers of Tianjin Yan'an Middle School at today's rally to further implement Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive expressed their determination to thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, to firmly establish Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, to resolutely take the revolutionary road of integrating with workers and peasants, and to become revolutionary cadres who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	Chairman Mao recently pointed out in a very profound way: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its leadership and the broad revolutionary masses on the one hand and the reactionary Kuomintang on the other. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Revolutionary cadres and the broad revolutionary masses in various places, while commemorating the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive, reviewed Chairman Mao's latest directive. They pointed out that to advance along the glorious path of Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive and to transform the entire country into a blazing red school of Mao Zedong Thought, we must currently arm ourselves with Chairman Mao's latest directive, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, resolutely oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, thoroughly smash the rightist reversal wind, launch a more fierce attack on the enemies of the proletariat, thoroughly eliminate all the revisionist poison spread by Liu Shaoqi and other top renegades, traitors, and scabs within the party and their agents, dig out all hidden traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries, carry the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes through to the end, and let the great Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions.

	Revolutionary cadres and the broad revolutionary masses in various places, while commemorating the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive, have decided to push the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new high. They said that studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, widely and deeply propagating Mao Zedong Thought, is the fundamental issue of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must raise the study and application of Chairman Mao's works to the height of defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and defending the proletarian revolutionary power, and in the stormy waves of class struggle, always stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Representatives from Changbai Korean Autonomous County's Dawaizi Production Brigade at the symposium on active learners of Mao Zedong Thought in Jilin Province introduced the brigade's experience in implementing Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive and striving to transform the brigade into a school of Mao Zedong Thought. She said that to transform it into a school of Mao Zedong Thought, we must adhere to the line of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism and struggle, and in the struggle, constantly break private interests and establish public interests, temper the red heart of unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, and achieve ideological revolutionization. Members of the revolutionary committees of Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, and Hebei provinces expressed their determination to further implement Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive in action, leading the broad revolutionary masses to carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more widely and deeply. Many members of local revolutionary committees also expressed their determination to strengthen the revolutionary construction of the revolutionary committees, making them truly revolutionary command headquarters that are unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, unlimitedly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and command headquarters that lead the broad revolutionary masses to firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The entire country must learn from the People's Liberation Army." At various meetings, the broad revolutionary masses pointed out that the great People's Liberation Army is a good example of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and establishing a school of Mao Zedong Thought. We must better learn from the People's Liberation Army. We must be as unlimitedly loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao as the People's Liberation Army, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought as the People's Liberation Army does, learn, propagate, and defend Chairman Mao's directives as the People's Liberation Army does. We must learn and implement the revolutionary traditions and precious experience of the People's Liberation Army in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the four firsts, and carrying forward the three-eight style. We must seize a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and transform the entire country into a blazing red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

	Xinhua News Agency, May 7th: The army, navy, and air force units of the People's Liberation Army have solemnly commemorated the second anniversary of the great leader Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive in recent days, enthusiastically celebrating the brilliant achievements made in implementing Chairman Mao's great directive in the class struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years, and determined to advance along the path of Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive, to push the great mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, and to further transform the entire army into a blazing red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

	Two years ago, the great helmsman Chairman Mao issued the May 7th Directive, which has great historical and strategic significance. It is a programmatic document for building socialism in our country and a guiding principle for the revolutionary construction of our army. Broad cadres and soldiers have expressed their determination to further study and implement Chairman Mao's great directive, to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian line of party and army building, to resolutely implement the series of principles and policies emphasized by Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the four firsts, carrying forward the three-eight style, creating the four good classes, and other principles and policies of emphasizing political construction of the army, and in the struggle between the two lines, to transform all units of the entire army into steadfast fighting collectives that are unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, and to cultivate all cadres and soldiers of the entire army into proletarian revolutionary fighters who are unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao.

	Over the past two years, the entire army, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's great directive that "the People's Liberation Army should be a great school," and under the inspiration of Vice Chairman Lin's directive that "the army must truly become a school of Mao Zedong Thought," and in the fiery class struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, carried out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism and struggle, and actively engaged in labor and agriculture. They have transformed the frontline positions of defending the country, the first line of "three supports and two militaries," and the industrial and agricultural production bases into classrooms for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, furnaces for soul-forging, and battlefields for criticizing and repudiating oneself. Broad cadres and soldiers have tempered their red hearts of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao in the struggle, defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and promoted ideological revolutionization. When they reviewed the rich fruits achieved over the past two years in the spiritual and material struggles, they were filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, singing praises of the brilliant May 7th Directive, "It is the fundamental of our army's construction, the direction of advance, the guide to action, and the source of strength." They deeply felt that firmly and unswervingly implementing Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive and constantly arming oneself with Mao Zedong Thought would definitely enable our army to forever maintain the proletarian revolutionary nature of the army, be unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, be unlimitedly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, be unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and forever become a great iron wall of steel for defending the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	In the capital, the various headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, the National Defense Industrial Office, various military branches, the Beijing Military Region, the Beijing Garrison Command, and other leading organs and their subordinate units, while commemorating the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive, have further launched a wave of studying, praising, and implementing the May 7th Directive. They have held symposia, report meetings, experience-sharing meetings, and celebratory meetings. Leaders of many units attended the meetings. The various units of the General Logistics Department held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, summarized and exchanged experiences in implementing Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive and establishing a school of Mao Zedong Thought, and formulated specific measures for further implementing the May 7th Directive. Many grassroots units of the Air Force, Navy, Beijing Military Region, and Beijing Garrison Command, using Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive as a weapon, launched a revolutionary criticism and struggle against Liu Shaoqi and other counter-revolutionary revisionists such as Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, who promoted the bourgeois military line, greatly enhancing the consciousness of broad cadres and soldiers in further implementing Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive. They said that we must carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism and struggle, thoroughly criticize and expose Liu Shaoqi and other top renegades, traitors, and scabs within the party, fight them down and stink them up, and in the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought and establish a school of Mao Zedong Thought.

	The leading organs and subordinate units of the Shenyang, Wuhan, Nanjing, Lanzhou, Chengdu, and Jinan armies, as well as the broad cadres and soldiers fighting on the first line of "three supports and two militaries," universally held various meetings, enthusiastically celebrating the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive. They expressed their determination to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian line of army building, to firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the stormy waves of class struggle, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to further strengthen the revolutionary construction of the army in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement, and to achieve new merits for the people in the struggle to defend the motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At a meeting attended by more than 13,000 people in the Nanjing Army, the leaders and representatives of the Nanjing Army expressed their determination to further implement Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive in the great struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to let Mao Zedong Thought command everything, to carry out a thorough ideological revolutionization, and to quickly cultivate more proletarian revolutionary fighters who are unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao. All representatives attending the conference of active learners of Mao Zedong Thought in the Wuhan Army expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to unite and fight with the broad revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses, to further implement Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive and his latest series of directives, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Cadres and soldiers of the "model platoon for supporting the left and loving the people" on the first line of "three supports and two militaries" solemnly pledged before Chairman Mao's portrait: Follow the great helmsman Chairman Mao closely, transform the fourth platoon into a blazing red school of Mao Zedong Thought, and become new people who are unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao like Li Wentong!

	Broad cadres and soldiers stationed on the front lines of national defense and coastal defense in the Guangzhou, Fuzhou, and Kunming armies, as well as the Tibet and Xinjiang Military Regions, in the solemn commemoration activities of the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive, dispatched large propaganda teams to go deep into islands and villages, to the cadres and soldiers guarding the border outposts and front-line islands, and to various ethnic poor and lower-middle peasants, fishermen, herdsmen, and militiamen, to propagate the May 7th Directive, to hold report meetings with them, to criticize the bourgeoisie together, and to discuss the gains and experiences of jointly building political border defenses. Everyone unanimously expressed that in the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must further carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, never forget class struggle, and heighten revolutionary vigilance, to build the country's ten-thousand-li border and coast into an invincible great iron wall.
