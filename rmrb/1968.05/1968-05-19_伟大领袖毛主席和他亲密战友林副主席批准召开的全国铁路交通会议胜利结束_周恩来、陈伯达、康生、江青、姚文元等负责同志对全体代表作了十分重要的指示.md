The national railway and transportation conference, approved by our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, concluded successfully in Beijing on May 15th amidst a great situation both domestically and internationally. The conference enthusiastically called upon all revolutionary workers on the national railway and transportation front to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and firmly grasp class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. It urged them to advance victoriously, develop the great situation, push the revolution and production on the railway and transportation front to a new high, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin received all the representatives attending the conference during the meeting, which greatly inspired and educated everyone. The representatives said that Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's reception was the greatest concern for the revolutionary workers on the national railway and transportation front, and also the greatest concern for the entire working class. They firmly declared that they would forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, firmly grasp the revolution, vigorously promote production, and never disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations.

This conference was conducted under the direct leadership of the Central Committee and the Central Cultural Revolution Group. Central leaders Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Jiang Qing, and Yao Wenyuan gave very important instructions to all the representatives.

This was the first large-scale conference held by the railway and transportation departments. Representatives from all railway bureaus, stations, sections, factories, institutes, and transportation and navigation bureaus, companies, ports, ships, as well as highway transportation departments across the country, totaling over 1,500 units and more than 6,000 revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and People's Liberation Army leftists, as well as representatives from relevant local mass organizations, attended the conference. The conference, from beginning to end, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, and firmly grasped class struggle. Therefore, it effectively promoted revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, advancing the revolutionization of people's thinking. Many representatives reflected that this conference was a very lively, practical, and effective Mao Zedong Thought study class.

During the conference, the representatives repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions and enthusiastically discussed the unprecedented great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The representatives pointed out that the revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary masses on the railway and transportation front, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, achieved one victory after another in the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. The revolutionary class ranks are becoming increasingly stronger, and new revolutionary committees are emerging. Mao Zedong Thought has never been as deeply rooted in people's hearts as it is now, and the broad revolutionary workers have never been as spirited, enthusiastic, and full of fighting spirit as they are now. Under the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary and production situation on the railway and transportation front is excellent and getting better and better.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary people under its leadership against the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The representatives, after studying Chairman Mao's teachings, had a deeper understanding of the great significance and class content of the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and further clarified the new characteristics and tasks of class struggle in the current situation. The representatives pointed out that the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to comprehensive victory, the more complex and profound the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines becomes. The enemies of the proletariat will never willingly accept their doom. In the great situation, they will inevitably adopt more concealed and more vicious means to sabotage revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and sabotage transportation and production. We must increase our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, resolutely oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, smash the rightist reversal wind, oppose the bourgeois reactionary thought of being "left" in form but right in essence, identify counter-revolutionary two-faced characters, and root out hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries to see the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

With boundless proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, the representatives criticized during the conference the heinous crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the railway and transportation departments in pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, greatly raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines. The representatives expressed their determination to carry out the deep and sustained revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the railway and transportation departments, overthrow and expose them, and further eliminate the poison of revisionism they spread.

The representatives believed that the revolutionary masses must, in the new situation, continue to advance the revolution, and thoroughly defeat the class enemies, must arm themselves further with Mao Zedong Thought, and must be good at distinguishing between the two different types of contradictions, uniting and educating their own class ranks. During the conference, the representatives, with Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions as their weapon, criticized bourgeois factionalism, enhanced proletarian party spirit, greatly consolidated and developed revolutionary great unity, and created a high tide of realizing the revolutionary three-in-one combination. According to statistics, so far, 97% of the units in the national railway and transportation departments have achieved revolutionary great unity, of which 62% have established revolutionary committees with the three-in-one combination, and 25% have reached agreements to realize the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Many representatives from units that have already established revolutionary committees, when talking about the current great situation, firmly declared that they would definitely follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary committees, strengthen the ideological and organizational construction of revolutionary committees, and consolidate and improve the newly born proletarian political power.

The conference pointed out: Transportation is an important production department that connects industry and agriculture and connects all departments of socialist production across the country. It is a major artery and hub of our entire socialist material production. The current great situation at home and abroad has put forward more glorious and heavier tasks for the railway and transportation departments, requiring us to raise transportation production to a new level to meet the needs of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great development of industrial and agricultural production, national defense construction and preparedness, supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, and supporting the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. The representatives felt a great sense of responsibility in their discussions. The conference emphasized: Only by grasping the revolution can we truly promote production. If the class enemies want to sabotage transportation production, we must resolutely smash all their tricks and schemes, further implement Chairman Mao's great instructions of "grasp the revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," and swiftly launch a new high tide of transportation production. The representatives expressed their firm belief that under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese proletariat not only can seize power but also definitely can govern the country well. The working class on the transportation front will definitely accomplish the glorious task of transportation production assigned by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee.

Under the inspiration of the great leader Chairman Mao's call to "grasp the revolution and promote production," the revolutionary workers on the national railway and transportation front were full of enthusiasm during the conference, and transportation production continued to rise. The average daily loading of national railways increased by 25%, water transport volume and port throughput increased by 20%, and a new high tide of transportation production is coming.

"Navigation at sea relies on the helmsman, revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." The representatives attending the conference, recalling their past battles, deeply felt that all the victories we have achieved are the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought. The most important thing is to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. Everyone expressed their determination to take Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, further carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously establish various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and focus on the revolutionization of people's thinking, turning the national railway and transportation departments into a red Mao Zedong Thought university.

    会议号召紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，坚决粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计，进一步贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大指示，最迅速地把铁路交通战线的革命和生产推向新高潮，胜利地完成毛主席和党中央交给的运输生产的光荣任务
    新华社十八日讯　我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席亲自批准召开的全国铁路、交通会议，在国内、国际一片大好形势下，五月十五日在北京胜利结束。会议热烈号召全国铁路、交通战线的广大革命职工，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线的斗争，乘胜前进，发展大好形势，把铁路交通战线的革命和生产推向一个新的高潮，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    伟大领袖毛主席和林彪副主席，在会议期间接见了参加会议的全体代表，使大家受到了极大的鼓舞和教育。代表们说，毛主席和林副主席的接见，是对全国铁路交通战线革命职工的最大关怀，也是对全国工人阶级的最大关怀。他们坚决表示，一定永远忠于毛主席，狠抓革命，猛促生产，绝不辜负毛主席的期望。
    这次会议是在中央和中央文革直接领导下进行的。周恩来、陈伯达、康生、江青、姚文元等中央和中央文革负责同志，对全体代表作了十分重要的指示。
    这次会议是铁路交通部门举行的第一次规模盛大的会议。参加会议的有来自全国各铁路局、站、段、厂、院和交通航务局、公司、港口、船舶以及公路运输部门等，共一千五百多个单位、六千多名革命群众、革命干部和人民解放军支左人员的代表，以及有关地方的群众组织的代表。会议自始至终高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，狠抓了阶级斗争。因而有力地推动了革命大联合和革命三结合，促进了人的思想革命化。不少代表反映，这次大会是一个很生动、很实际、很有成效的毛泽东思想学习班。
    会议期间，代表们反复学习了毛主席的一系列最新指示，畅谈了无产阶级文化大革命的空前大好形势。代表们指出，铁路、交通战线的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中取得了一个又一个的胜利。革命的阶级队伍越来越壮大，新诞生的革命委员会联翩出现。毛泽东思想从来没有象现在这样深入人心，广大革命职工从来没有象现在这样精神振奋、意气风发、斗志昂扬。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，铁路、交通战线的革命和生产形势一片大好，越来越好。
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”代表们学习了毛主席的这一教导，更加深刻地认识了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义和阶级内容，进一步明确了当前形势下阶级斗争的新特点和新任务。代表们指出，无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，越是复杂，越是深刻。无产阶级的敌人决不甘心于他们的灭亡。在大好形势下，他们必然会采取更加隐蔽、更加毒辣的手段，破坏革命大联合和革命三结合，破坏运输生产。我们一定要百倍地提高革命警惕性，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚决反对右倾机会主义，反对右倾分裂主义，反对右倾投降主义，粉碎右倾翻案妖风，反对形“左”实右的资产阶级反动思想，识别反革命两面派，把暗藏的叛徒、特务和反革命分子挖出来，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    代表们怀着无限忠于毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，在会议期间愤怒批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁路、交通部门代理人推行反革命修正主义路线的滔天罪行，大大提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟。代表们表示，一定要把革命的大批判深入持久地开展下去，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁路、交通部门的代理人批深批透，斗倒斗臭，进一步清除他们散布的修正主义毒素。
    代表们认为，无产阶级革命派要在新形势下把革命继续推向前进，要彻底战胜阶级敌人，必须用毛泽东思想进一步武装自己，必须善于区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结和教育自己的阶级队伍。会议期间，代表们以毛主席一系列最新指示为武器，批判了资产阶级派性，增强了无产阶级党性，大大巩固和发展了革命的大联合，出现了实现革命三结合的高潮。据统计，到目前为止，全国铁路、交通部门已有百分之九十七的单位实现了革命的大联合，其中百分之六十二的单位成立了三结合的革命委员会，百分之二十五的单位达成了实现革命三结合的协议。许多已经建立了革命委员会的单位的代表，在谈到当前大好形势的时候，都坚定地表示，一定遵照毛主席关于革命委员会的最新教导，加强革命委员会的思想建设和组织建设，巩固和完善新诞生的无产阶级政权。
    会议指出：交通运输是工业农业互相联系、全国社会主义生产各部门互相联系的重要生产部门，是我们整个社会主义物质生产的重大命脉，重大枢纽。当前，国内外的大好形势，对铁路、交通部门提出了更加光荣、更加繁重的任务，要求我们把运输生产提高到一个新的水平，以适应夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的需要，适应工农业生产大发展的需要，适应国防建设和战备的需要，适应支援兄弟的越南人民抗美救国战争和支援全世界人民革命斗争的需要。代表们在讨论中一致感到自己责任重大。会议着重指出：只有抓革命，才能真正的促生产。阶级敌人要破坏运输生产，我们就要坚决粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计，进一步贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大指示，最迅速地掀起运输生产的新高潮。代表们表示坚信，在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，中国的无产阶级，不仅能够打下天下，而且一定能够坐好天下。交通运输战线上的工人阶级，一定能够胜利地完成毛主席和党中央交给的运输生产的光荣任务。
    在伟大领袖毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”号召的鼓舞下，会议期间，全国铁路、交通战线的革命职工干劲十足，运输生产不断上升，全国铁路每日装车的平均水平提高了百分之二十五，水运运量和港口吞吐量上升了百分之二十，一个新的运输生产的新高潮正在到来。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”参加会议的代表回忆过去的战斗历程，深深感到我们取得的一切胜利，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，千重要，万重要，活学活用毛泽东思想最重要。大家表示，决心以林副主席为光辉榜样，更加深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，大力办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，大抓人的思想革命化，把全国铁路、交通部门办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
