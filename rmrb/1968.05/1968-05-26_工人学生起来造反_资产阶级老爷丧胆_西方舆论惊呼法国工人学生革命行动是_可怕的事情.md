The massive struggle of French workers and students against the reactionary rule of French monopoly capitalists has shaken the entire capitalist world and struck fear into the hearts of the bourgeoisie. Western newspapers and public opinion are in a state of panic, crying out that this is a "serious revolutionary movement" facing the "Western world," a "terrible thing."

The British newspaper *The Scotsman* published an editorial on May 18 titled "Students and Workers" stating: "In modern Western society, this may be the first time that students and workers have joined hands to oppose the government." The Associated Press even screamed that the struggle of French workers and students is no longer just a demonstration or riot. "That is rebellion."

The West German newspaper *Handelsblatt* wrote in a state of panic: "France's unfortunate moment is also the unfortunate moment for the Federal Republic (referring to West Germany), Europe, and the entire free world."

The convergence of the French workers' movement and the students' movement has dealt a powerful blow to the reactionary rule of French monopoly capital, causing endless worry in the capitalist world of the West. The ruling classes of various countries are deeply afraid that their people will rise up and rebel against them, overthrowing their rule. Some bourgeois newspapers have cried out: "The situation in France is a 'pre-revolutionary' situation." The West Berlin newspaper *Der Tagesspiegel* anxiously said: "The current developments in France reflect a revolutionary movement. This movement began at the universities and now includes workers, peasants, and other strata of French society." The British bourgeois mouthpiece *The Times* lamented in an editorial: "The disintegration of French society is not only a disaster for France itself but also for France's neighboring countries. If the youth and the working class of France do not accept modern society (referring to capitalist society), then the youth and workers of other European countries may do the same."

This French workers' movement and students' movement have developed with unprecedented speed, completely catching the rulers off guard. Especially, the broad masses of workers and students, kicking out the revisionist leaders of the French Communist Party and the yellow union heads, breaking the old rules of strikes, directly taking mass, militant rebellious actions, have made the bourgeois propaganda machines feel uneasy. The United Press International pointed out: "Many strikes in France are carried out by young workers without the agreement of union leaders. Workers are no longer satisfied with informal strike actions; they have occupied factories and detained management personnel." The West German newspaper *Frankfurter Rundschau* also wrote: "All the central union organizations in Paris, the Communists (referring to the French Communist Party revisionist group), and the Socialists are deeply shocked by the workers' revolutionary movement. They, like the government, are not prepared. No leader organized the occupation of these factories, and there was no plan for the occupation of these factories."

Some Western bourgeois public opinion, terrified by the struggle of French workers and students, feel immense fear about the great influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China in the world. *Le Figaro* wrote under the title "The 'Cultural Revolution' of China Takes Root in France": "In the lecture halls of (the University of Paris), wall newspapers are everywhere, completely in the style of China's 'Cultural Revolution'." The British newspaper *Daily Telegraph* also wrote under the title "The Chinese-style Rebellion of Paris Students," pointing out that Paris students are no longer satisfied with "participating in the management of the university" but are "striving to expand their revolution, aiming to transform French society." The former British Labour Party MP Brockway also exclaimed: "The rebellion of French students and workers is a reflection of the revolutionary movement that is brewing around the world." He worriedly said: "Tomorrow, this movement will happen in South Africa, and it may even happen here in Britain."

    工人学生起来造反  资产阶级老爷丧胆
    西方舆论惊呼法国工人学生革命行动是“可怕的事情”
    本报讯　声势浩大的法国工人和学生反对法国垄断资产阶级反动统治的正义斗争，震撼整个资本主义世界，吓坏了资产阶级的老爷们。西方报刊和舆论惶恐不安地惊呼这是“西方世界”面临的一次严重的“革命运动”，是“可怕的事情”。
    英国《苏格兰人报》五月十八日以《学生与工人》为题发表社论说：法国的“学生和工人携起手来反对政府，这在现代西方世界中也许还是第一次。”美联社更喊叫法国工人和学生斗争已“不再是示威游行了，也不是骚乱了。那是造反了”。西德《商业报》胆战心惊地写道：“法国的不幸的时刻也是联邦共和国（指西德）、欧洲和整个自由世界的不幸时刻”。
    法国工人运动和学生运动的汇合，给法国垄断资本反动统治以猛烈的冲击，这在西方资本主义世界引起了无穷的忧虑。各国统治集团深怕本国人民将象法国工人和学生一样起来造他们的反，革他们的命。一些资产阶级报刊惊呼：法国的形势是“革命前的”形势。西柏林的《电讯报》惴惴不安地说：“法国目前的事态发展反映了一种革命运动。这个运动开始于大学，它目前包括了工人、农民和法国社会的其他阶层。”英国垄断资产阶级喉舌《泰晤士报》的社论哀叹：“法国社会的解体不仅对法国本身，对法国的邻国也将是灾难”，“如果法国的青年和法国的工人阶级不接受现代的社会（指资本主义社会），那么欧洲其它国家的青年和工人也可能这样”。
    这次法国工人运动和学生运动来势异常迅猛，完全出乎统治者的意料之外。特别是广大工人、学生踢开法修和黄色工会头目，打破过去罢工的清规戒律，直接采取群众性的、富有战斗性的造反行动，使资产阶级的御用宣传机器感到惶惶不安。合众国际社指出：法国工人的“许多罢工是由青年工人未经工会领导人同意就举行的。工人已不满足于单纯的非正式罢工行动，他们占领了工厂，禁闭了管理人员”。西德的《法兰克福评论报》也写道：“所有在巴黎的工会中央机构，共产党人（指法共修正主义集团）和社会党人都由于工人的革命运动深感震惊。他们象政府一样没有什么准备。没有一个领导成员组织这些对工厂的占领，也没有计划过对这些工厂的占领。”
    被法国工人和学生的斗争吓得魂不附体的一些西方资产阶级舆论，对中国无产阶级文化大革命在全世界的巨大影响感到万分恐惧。《法兰西晚报》就以《中国的“文化革命”在法国生根》为题写道：“在（巴黎大学）阶梯教室里，墙报到处都是，完全具有中国‘文化革命’的风格”。英国《每日电讯报》也以《巴黎学生的中国式的造反》为题，指出巴黎学生已不满足于“参与对大学的管理”，而是“致力于要扩大他们的革命，目的是改造法国的社会”。英国前工党议员布罗克韦也惊叫：“法国学生和工人的造反是正在全世界蔓延的酝酿中的革命的一个反映”。他忧心忡忡地说：“明天，这个运动将发生在南非，甚至可能在英国这里。”
