The revolutionary cadres and workers of the Liaoyuan Power Plant in Jilin Province have, over the past year, intensified class struggle, repeatedly implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and continuously foiled the enemy's plots to sabotage the revolution and production. They have achieved double victories in both revolution and production. By the first decade of this month, the plant had safely generated electricity for over 700 consecutive days. The coal consumption rate, which had been decreasing year after year, continued to drop, reaching the most advanced level in the plant's history.

    吉林辽源发电厂革命生产获得双胜利
    据新华社长春二十五日电　吉林省辽源发电厂的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，一年来，通过狠抓阶级斗争，反复落实毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，不断粉碎阶级敌人破坏革命和生产的阴谋，取得了革命、生产的双胜利。到今年五月上旬，这个厂已连续七百多天安全发电，煤耗量在过去连年降低的基础上继续下降，创造了这个厂历史上最先进的水平。
