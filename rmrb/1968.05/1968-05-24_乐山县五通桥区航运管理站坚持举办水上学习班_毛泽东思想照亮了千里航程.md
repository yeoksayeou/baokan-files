The Five-Tong Bridge District Navigation Management Station in Leshan County, Sichuan Province, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel, has persistently held waterborne Mao Zedong Thought study classes according to the characteristics of water transportation. They have turned wooden boats into classrooms for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and into battlefields for carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle, thus illuminating the thousand-mile journey with Mao Zedong Thought.

This station is responsible for water transportation from Leshan to Chongqing. Over 1,600 boatmen and more than 200 wooden boats are distributed along the 1,000-mile Minjiang and Yangtze River waterways. Initially, some people thought that since the navigation stations are numerous and the lines are long, the tasks are heavy, and the personnel are mobile and dispersed, Mao Zedong Thought study classes could be held more frequently during idle times and less frequently during busy times, otherwise, it might affect production. With the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel, the revolutionary cadres of the station organized the boatmen to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings such as "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work" and, in combination with the actual situation of the unit, extensively discussed the importance of taking Mao Zedong Thought as the banner and emphasizing proletarian politics. This made everyone realize: "A ship sailing on the vast ocean needs a helmsman, and a revolution needs Mao Zedong Thought." After the boatmen's awareness was raised, they decided that during busy transportation tasks, they must persist in holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, letting Mao Zedong Thought illuminate the thousand-mile journey of the Yangtze and Minjiang Rivers. Starting from last November, all the wooden boats of this station have successively held waterborne study classes, with over 95% of the boatmen participating in the study. Through holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, various tasks have been effectively promoted, and a new scene of revolutionary fervor and production enthusiasm has emerged. Last year, the entire station completed the state production plan seven days ahead of schedule, and this year's first quarter also completed the tasks assigned by the state.

These waterborne Mao Zedong Thought study classes all take the revolutionary criticism and struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev as an important content. The boatmen study one of Chairman Mao's quotations, criticize one of the Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies, investigate how the capitalist roaders in their unit resonate with the Chinese Khrushchev, and at the same time combine the struggle against selfishness with the struggle against revisionism. They cleanse the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionism of the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, promoting their own ideological revolutionization. They also combine the class struggle reality of this station to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies such as the theory of "class struggle extinction" and the theory of "exploitation is meritorious," launching a resolute and fierce offensive against the class enemies.

The boatmen of this navigation station, in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, earnestly carry forward the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao, being loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao with a single "loyalty" and grasping the use of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought with a single "use." Most of the boatmen in the navigation station have a history of blood and tears. The waterborne study classes, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "class struggle, once grasped, it works," guide everyone to extensively speak about the bitter history of boatmen before liberation, extensively speak about the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads on the Yangtze River waterway in the past decade, extensively speak about the great wisdom and brilliant leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, arousing the boatmen's class struggle awareness and two-line struggle awareness, strengthening the boatmen's boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian feelings, and greatly enhancing the boatmen's awareness of combining learning with use. Although many boatmen have a low level of education, they firmly remember: loyalty is shown through actions. They study and apply Mao Zedong Thought bit by bit, combining theory with practice, speaking and doing consistently, learning and using consistently. Because the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao was carried forward in the waterborne study classes, the spiritual outlook of the broad masses of boatmen in the navigation station has been completely renewed, and good people and good deeds have emerged in large numbers. In February of this year, a wooden boat from a nearby people's commune sank, and there was a diesel engine for pumping water on the boat. Boatman Mei Zhaoqiang thought that the current spring plowing season is a busy time, and if the diesel engine and the boat are not salvaged quickly, it will affect the revolution and production. Thinking of these, he dived into the water more than two zhangs deep three times in a row to salvage the boat. Because he stayed underwater for too long, his nose bled. At this moment, he heard a loud voice: "Carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, fearing no sacrifice, fearing no fatigue, and continuous fighting (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." Chairman Mao's great teachings gave him great encouragement, and he immediately dived into the water for the fourth time, finally salvaging the boat and the machine.

The proletarian revolutionary cadres and the People's Liberation Army's leftist support personnel of the station have done a lot of specific organizational work to help the boatmen hold good waterborne Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

    乐山县五通桥区航运管理站坚持举办水上学习班
    毛泽东思想照亮了千里航程
    这个站的所有木船都先后办起学习班，成为活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂，开展革命大批判的战场。船工精神面貌一新，好人好事层出不穷
    据新华社成都电　四川省乐山县五通桥区航运管理站，在人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，根据水上运输的特点，坚持举办水上毛泽东思想学习班，把木船变成活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂，开展革命大批判的战场，使毛泽东思想照亮了千里航程。
    这个站担负着乐山到重庆一带的水上运输任务。一千六百多名船工、二百多条木船，分布在一千多里的岷江、长江航运线上。开始时，有些人认为，航运站点多线长，任务繁重，人员流动分散，毛泽东思想学习班可以闲时多办，忙时少办，否则容易影响生产。站上的革命派在人民解放军支左人员帮助下，组织船工反复学习了毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”等教导，结合本单位的实际情况，大谈用毛泽东思想挂帅，突出无产阶级政治的重要性，使大家认识到：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”船工们认识提高以后，决定在运输任务繁忙的情况下，越要坚持大办毛泽东思想学习班，让毛泽东思想来照亮长江和岷江的千里航线。从去年十一月开始，这个站的所有木船都先后办起了船上学习班，百分之九十五以上的船工参加了学习。通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，有力地推动了各项工作，出现了革命轰轰烈烈，生产热气腾腾的新景象。去年全站提前七天完成国家生产计划，今年第一季度也完成了国家下达的任务。
    这些水上毛泽东思想学习班，都把对中国赫鲁晓夫开展革命的大批判作为重要内容。船工们学一条毛主席语录，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的一个反动谬论，查一查本单位的走资派是怎样和中国赫鲁晓夫相呼应的，同时把斗私和批修结合起来，通过肃清中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义流毒，促进自己的思想革命化。他们还结合本站的阶级斗争实际，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“剥削有功”论等反革命修正主义谬论，向阶级敌人发动了主动的猛烈的进攻。
    这个航运站的船工们，在毛泽东思想学习班上，认真发扬毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字。航运站的大部分船工都有一部血泪史。水上学习班遵照毛主席“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的教导，引导大家大讲解放前船工的苦难史，大讲十几年来长江航运战线两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，大讲伟大领袖毛主席的伟大天才和英明领导，启发了船工们的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，增强了船工们无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级感情，大大提高了船工们学用结合的自觉性。许多船工虽然文化程度不高，但是他们牢记一条：忠不忠，看行动。他们对毛泽东思想学一点，用一点，理论联系实际，说到做到，言行一致，学用一致。由于在水上学习班里发扬了毛主席亲自倡导的革命学风，航运站广大船工的精神面貌焕然一新，好人好事层出不穷。今年二月，附近人民公社的一只木船沉了，船上装着抽水用的柴油机。船工梅朝湘想到，当前正是春耕大忙季节，如果不赶快把柴油机和船打捞上来，就要影响到抓革命促生产。想到这些，他便连续三次潜入两丈多深的水中去打捞。由于在水里憋的时间过长，鼻子呛出了血，这时，他耳边响起巨大的声音：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”毛主席的伟大教导给了他巨大的鼓舞，他马上第四次潜入水中，终于把船和机器都捞上来了。
    站上的无产阶级革命派和解放军支左人员，为帮助船工办好水上毛泽东思想学习班，进行了许多具体的组织工作。
