The political secretary of the French Marxist-Leninist Communist Party, Georges Marchais, recently published an article titled "Supporting the Students' Struggle" in *Nouvel Humanité*, firmly supporting and enthusiastically praising the brave struggle of French students. He calls for students and workers to unite against the monopoly capital, imperialism, and fascism, and strongly condemns the treacherous actions of the French revisionist group in disrupting the student movement.

The article states: "The French Communist Party supports and calls on everyone to support the students' struggle." It points out that French students have launched a fierce and brave struggle against the regime of monopoly capital; this struggle strongly opposes the resurgence of fascism; and this struggle exposes the role of revisionist leaders serving the bourgeoisie. This struggle is driving French youth to oppose the corrupt capitalist society and the bourgeois dictatorship.

The article states: This struggle "will inevitably drive all laboring classes in our country, led by the working class (because the working class is the thoroughly revolutionary class), to rise up against the system of human exploitation, against the capitalist system that is inherently exploitative, oppressive, and reactionary."

The article points out that the French government's policy on universities only considers the needs of monopoly capital. Issues of productivity and maximum profit take priority. It is only natural that students rise up in rebellion.

The article exposes many facts about the resurgence of fascist forces in France and enthusiastically praises the students' brave struggle against fascism. The article calls on workers and all laboring people to support the students' struggle and to establish a powerful anti-fascist front. This is "an urgent task."

The article also praises the efforts of French students in the struggle against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam. The article points out: "The students' struggle is also directed against U.S. imperialism."

The article severely condemns the treacherous actions of the French revisionist group in disrupting the student movement. The article states: "The revisionist leaders have become agents of the bourgeoisie within the working class," "they have become the watchdogs of the bourgeoisie, and as soon as the bourgeois order is threatened, they immediately react and unhesitatingly take a reactionary stance (against the students) to interfere."

The article concludes by calling on French workers and all urban and rural laborers to actively support the just struggle of French students and to jointly establish a front against monopoly capital, imperialism, and fascism.

    法国马列主义共产党书记儒尔盖热情赞扬学生的正义斗争
    号召工人学生团结起来反对帝国主义制度

    新华社二十五日讯　法国马克思列宁主义共产党政治书记儒尔盖最近在《新人道报》上发表题为《支持学生的斗争》的文章，坚决支持和热烈赞扬法国学生的英勇斗争，号召学生同工人团结起来，建立起反对垄断资本、反对帝国主义和反对法西斯主义的阵线，并且强烈谴责法国修正主义集团破坏学生运动的叛徒行径。
    文章说：“法国共产党支持并呼吁大家支持学生的斗争。”文章指出，法国学生“掀起这场激烈和英勇的斗争，是针对垄断资本的政权的；这场斗争猛烈地反对法西斯卷土重来；这场斗争还揭露了修正主义头目为资产阶级效劳的角色。”这场斗争正在推动法国青年起来反对腐朽糜烂的资本主义社会，反对资产阶级专政的制度。
    文章说：这场斗争“必将推动我国以工人阶级（因为工人阶级是彻底革命的阶级）为首的一切劳动阶层起来反对人剥削人的制度，反对掠夺成性、进行压迫和倒行逆施的资本主义。”
    文章指出，法国政府关于大学的政策，只考虑到垄断资本的需要。生产率和最高利润的问题在其中占首要地位。学生们起来造反是理所当然的。
    文章以许多事实揭露法国的法西斯势力正在重新兴风作浪，并热烈赞扬学生反对法西斯主义的英勇斗争。文章呼吁工人和一切劳动人民起来支持学生的斗争，并建立起一个强大的反法西斯阵线。因为这是“一项急需的任务。”
    文章还赞扬法国学生在反对美帝国主义侵略越南的斗争中所作的努力。文章指出：“学生斗争的矛头也是针对美帝国主义的。”
    文章严厉谴责法国修正主义集团破坏学生运动的叛卖行径。文章说：“修正主义领导人已变成资产阶级在工人阶级队伍中的代理人”，“成了资产阶级的看家狗，只要资产阶级秩序遭到威胁，他们就立即作出反应，毫不迟疑地采取反动立场（对学生）进行干涉。”
    文章最后号召法国工人和所有城乡劳动者，积极支持法国学生的正义斗争，共同建立起一个反对垄断资本、反对帝国主义和反对法西斯主义的阵线。
