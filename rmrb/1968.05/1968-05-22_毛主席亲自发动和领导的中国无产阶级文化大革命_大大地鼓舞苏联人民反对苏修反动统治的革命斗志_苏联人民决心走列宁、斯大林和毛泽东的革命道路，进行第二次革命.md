Two years ago, the Chinese proletarian revolutionary masses and hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, under the personal guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao in formulating the brilliant historical document—the May 16 Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966—have bravely fought and achieved decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This great revolution has struck a heavy blow to the traitorous clique of Soviet revisionists, making them tremble with fear and anxiety. This great revolution has further awakened the Soviet revolutionary people, greatly inspiring their revolutionary spirit to overthrow the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionists, and igniting their heroic spirit to dare to struggle and dare to win.

The Chinese Cultural Revolution has dealt a heavy blow to the Soviet revisionists.

The victorious progress of the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has dealt a heavy blow to the traitorous clique of Soviet revisionists, shaking their shaky "throne."

The greatest lesson of the international proletarian dictatorship is that in the first socialist state, the Soviet Union, and in some other socialist countries, capitalism was restored through the method of "peaceful evolution." Our great leader Chairman Mao summed up the historical experience of the international proletarian dictatorship, especially the lessons of the Soviet Union, and led the Chinese people in carrying out an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This revolution found the way to prevent the restoration of capitalism, completely and thoroughly solving the most important issue of the contemporary international communist movement. This great revolution smashed the imperialists' and modern revisionists' plot to restore capitalism in China, declared the doom of the traitorous clique of Soviet revisionists who are fully restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union, and caused great fear, hatred, and panic among these traitors. The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique exclaimed that this great revolution brought them "unforeseeable consequences."

To prevent the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese revolutionary masses in overthrowing the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party from "infecting" the Soviet people and inciting them to revolt, the Soviet revisionist traitors have used every means to block the true situation of the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have also spread lies such as "the cultural revolution has been completed in the Soviet Union," "class struggle has long been eliminated," and "the Soviet Union is a society without privileged classes and strata" to deceive the Soviet people and maintain their shaky reactionary rule.

For the past two years, the Soviet leadership has almost never stopped viciously attacking, slandering, and cursing the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which also proves from the opposite side how heavy a blow the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has dealt to them. The great victories achieved by this unprecedented great revolution in politics, ideology, and organization over the past two years have shattered the traitorous clique of Soviet revisionists' delusion that the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution would "miscarry." This great revolution has further awakened the Soviet people. Now, it is even more difficult for the Soviet revisionist clowns to deceive the Soviet people with the banner of "comprehensive construction of communism" and malicious anti-China slander.

The Soviet people are awakening as they study Mao Zedong Thought.

The Soviet people have personally experienced the extremely bitter lessons of the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union. Over the past two years, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao has destroyed the bourgeois headquarters within our Party, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, and smashed their plot to overthrow our proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism, further strengthening the proletarian dictatorship. This has made the Soviet revolutionary people recognize the great significance of this great revolution that ensures the red base of socialism will never change color, and their understanding of Mao Zedong Thought has deepened.

Despite the Soviet revisionist clique's use of all shameful means to block, distort, and attack the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary people of the Soviet Union have enthusiastically praised and firmly supported the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. A Soviet youth said, "Mao Zedong and his comrades-in-arms do not allow all anti-communist ghosts and snakes to seize power; they are right." Another Soviet citizen pointed out, "The Chinese Khrushchev is just like the Soviet Khrushchev, a scoundrel, and should be overthrown." A Soviet worker said, "Revolutionary committees are being established one after another in various provinces and cities in China, and the proletarian dictatorship is unprecedentedly consolidated. The revolutionary situation in China is excellent. I completely believe that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is correct and brilliant!"

As the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepens and advances, the broad revolutionary people of the Soviet Union increasingly recognize the great international and historical significance of this great revolution. A Soviet citizen said passionately, "The influence of the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is also like the October Revolution, spreading throughout the world." An old Soviet sailor said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao is very good. This proves that after the proletariat seizes power, it must go through such a great revolution to consolidate the power and prevent the emergence of a new bourgeoisie and new exploiters." A revolutionary organization in the Soviet Union opposing the Khrushchev revisionist clique, the "Stalin Group," recently emphasized in an article, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the continuation and development of the universal path of the October Revolution, the inevitable result of the socialist revolution and socialist construction. All countries with proletarian dictatorship must inevitably go through this stage of the socialist revolution." "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is consistent in class content but different in national form, is a universal law of Marxism-Leninism."

The victorious progress of the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made the great Mao Zedong Thought spread more widely in the Soviet Union. The Soviet revolutionary people increasingly recognize that Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times, and they love the contemporary revolutionary leader, Chairman Mao, even more deeply. A Soviet laborer said, "Mao Zedong has brilliantly and creatively developed Marxism-Leninism." A farmer in Siberia was very excited and said, "Mao Zedong Thought is a true revolutionary theory. Mao Zedong Thought not only illuminates the path of the Chinese revolution but also illuminates the path of the world revolution." A Soviet soldier said, "Comrade Mao Zedong is a truly great revolutionary, a living Lenin." Three Georgian workers said with deep affection, "Comrade Mao Zedong is the savior and hope of the world revolutionary people, our closest kin."

The Soviet people will surely rise up to overthrow the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionists.

Chairman Mao often points out: A revolutionary party and revolutionary people always have to go through education from both positive and negative aspects, through comparison and contrast, to be tempered and mature, and to have the guarantee of victory.

More and more Soviet revolutionary people, through comparing and analyzing the great victories achieved by the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the historical tragedy of the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union, are arming themselves with the invincible Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and have further awakened politically.

Through the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Soviet revolutionary people have further seen through the long-term deceptive propaganda of the Soviet leadership, recognizing that Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like are the bourgeoisie in power in the Soviet Union, recognizing that this small group of traitors, under the banner of "communist construction," have fully restored capitalism in the Soviet Union. They increasingly recognize the great truth taught by Chairman Mao: The fundamental question of the revolution is the question of power. With power, one has everything; without power, one loses everything. They angrily point out, "The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique has betrayed Marxism-Leninism, betrayed Lenin's path, and led the Soviet Union onto the capitalist road." "Proletarian dictatorship, the power of the laboring class, no longer exists in the Soviet Union," "State power is now in the hands of the enemies of the people," "in the hands of the agents of the bourgeoisie."

Through the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Soviet revolutionary people increasingly understand that the contradiction between the broad laboring people of the Soviet Union and the Soviet leadership is the main contradiction in Soviet society today, and this contradiction is an irreconcilable antagonistic class contradiction, a life-and-death struggle. They all complain that under the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionist leadership, class differentiation in the Soviet Union is increasingly severe, and the gap between the rich and the poor is widening. They say, "Now the 'leaders' of the Soviet Union are just like the capitalists and landlords before the October Revolution." These people "do not work but have a lot of income, and ordinary workers are exploited by them."

For many years, the Soviet revolutionary people have taken various forms to resolutely fight against the traitorous clique of Soviet revisionists.

The Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has greatly inspired their fighting spirit. They recognize that to rebuild the proletarian dictatorship, a second revolution must be carried out in the Soviet Union to thoroughly smash the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionists. A Soviet worker said, he would propagate the truth of the revolution throughout the country, arouse the Soviet people to revolt, and follow the revolutionary path of Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong. A member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union recently told a Chinese comrade, "The Soviet people will surely rise up to carry out a second revolution and overthrow the Soviet revisionist leadership. The Soviet people will surely win." Another Soviet worker said, "A second revolution must be carried out in the Soviet Union. We must learn the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese Red Guards to rebel against Brezhnev, Kosygin, and a small group of them, and reestablish a Soviet Socialist Republic with proletarian dictatorship." A revolutionary organization in the Soviet Union, the "Stalin Group," recently solemnly declared to carry out a revolution in the Soviet Union, "overthrow the power of the degenerate and transformed elements (new bourgeoisie elements) in the Soviet Union," fully demonstrating the heroic spirit and determination of the Soviet proletariat to carry out the proletarian revolution.

Now, the world has entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. The revolutionary struggles of the world are surging to new heights. The traitorous clique of Soviet revisionists, who have usurped the fruits of the October Revolution, currently face a situation of internal and external difficulties, disintegration, and their days are not good, and they are struggling desperately. The Soviet people are increasingly awakening and are taking various measures to fight against the traitorous clique of Soviet revisionists. As the great revolutionary teacher Lenin taught, "No matter how difficult the revolution is or how likely it is to suffer temporary defeats, no matter how high the reactionary wave surges, the final victory of the proletariat is inevitable." The traitorous clique of Soviet revisionists can absolutely not stop the advance of the wheel of history. The cause of the October Revolution will surely achieve final victory in the Soviet Union.

    毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命  大大地鼓舞苏联人民反对苏修反动统治的革命斗志
    苏联人民决心走列宁、斯大林和毛泽东的革命道路，进行第二次革命
    据新华社二十一日讯　本社记者报道：两年来，中国无产阶级革命派和亿万革命群众在伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的光辉历史文献——中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》的指引下英勇奋战，已经取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。这场大革命敲响了苏修叛徒集团的丧钟，使他们胆战心惊，惶惶不安。这场大革命使苏联革命人民进一步觉醒，大大鼓舞了他们推翻苏修反动统治的革命斗志，激发了他们敢于斗争、敢于胜利的英雄气概。
    中国文化大革命沉重地打击了苏修
    中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进展，给了苏修叛徒集团以十分沉重的打击，震撼了他们支离歪斜的“宝座”。
    国际无产阶级专政最大的教训，就是在第一个社会主义国家苏联和其他一些社会主义国家里，通过“和平演变”方式复辟了资本主义。我们伟大的领袖毛主席总结了国际无产阶级专政的历史经验，特别是苏联的教训，发动和领导中国亿万群众进行了史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，找到了防止资本主义复辟的道路，完整地、彻底地解决了当代国际共产主义运动的这个最重大的课题。这场大革命粉碎了帝国主义和现代修正主义妄图在中国复辟资本主义的阴谋，宣布了正在苏联全面复辟资本主义的苏修叛徒集团的末日的来临，引起了这些叛徒们极大的恐惧、仇恨和惊慌。勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团惊呼这场大革命给他们“带来无法预计的后果”。
    为了阻挠中国广大革命群众对党内走资本主义道路当权派造反的革命精神“传染给”苏联人民，促使他们起来造反，苏修叛徒们千方百计封锁中国无产阶级文化大革命的真实情况。他们并竭力散布什么在苏联“文化革命已经完成”，“阶级斗争早已消灭”，苏联已经是“没有特权阶级和特权阶层的社会”之类的谎言，欺骗苏联人民，以维持苏修摇摇欲坠的反动统治。
    两年来，苏修领导集团几乎没有一天不穷凶极恶地对中国无产阶级文化大革命进行诬蔑、攻击和咒骂，这也从反面证明了中国无产阶级文化大革命对他们的打击是多么沉重。两年来这场史无前例的大革命在政治上、思想上、组织上所取得的伟大胜利，粉碎了苏修叛徒们期待中国无产阶级文化大革命“夭折”的痴心妄想。这场大革命使苏联人民进一步觉醒。现在苏联修正主义小丑们再要用“全面建设共产主义”的旗号和恶毒的反华诽谤来欺骗苏联人民，是更加困难了。
    苏联人民学习毛泽东思想正在觉醒
    苏联人民亲身经受了资本主义在苏联复辟的极其惨痛的教训。两年来，毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，摧毁了隐藏在我们党内的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，粉碎了他们妄图颠覆我国无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的阴谋，进一步强化了无产阶级专政。这使苏联革命人民认识到这场保证社会主义国家红色江山永不变色的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，他们对毛泽东思想的认识更加深刻了。
    尽管苏修集团不惜使出一切无耻手段对中国无产阶级文化大革命进行封锁、歪曲和攻击，但是苏联广大革命人民却热烈赞扬、坚决支持中国无产阶级文化大革命。一位苏联青年说：“毛泽东和他的战友们不让一切反共产主义的牛鬼蛇神夺取政权，他们做得对。”另一位苏联公民指出：“中国的赫鲁晓夫象苏联的赫鲁晓夫一样，是个坏蛋，应该把他打倒。”一位苏联工人说，“中国各省市革命委员会接连地成立，无产阶级专政空前巩固，中国革命形势大好。我完全相信毛主席的革命路线英明正确！”
    随着中国无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展和胜利前进，苏联广大革命人民日益认识到这场大革命的伟大国际意义和历史意义。一位苏联公民满怀激情地指出：“中国无产阶级文化大革命的影响也和十月革命一样，传遍全世界。”苏联一位老海员说，“毛主席领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命非常好。这证明了，在无产阶级取得政权以后，一定要通过这样一场大革命，才能巩固政权，才能防止产生新的资产阶级和新的剥削者。”苏联一个反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团的革命组织“斯大林小组”在最近散发的一篇文章中强调指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是十月革命普遍道路的继续和发展，是社会主义革命和社会主义建设的必然结果。一切无产阶级专政的国家都必不可免地要经过社会主义革命的这一阶段。”“在阶级内容方面一致，而在民族形式方面不同的无产阶级文化大革命是马克思列宁主义的普遍规律。”
    中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进展，使伟大的毛泽东思想在苏联得到了越来越广泛的传播。苏联革命人民越来越清楚地认识到，毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，更加深了对当代无产阶级革命导师毛主席的热爱。一位苏联劳动者说：“毛泽东天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义。”西伯利亚一位农艺师十分激动地说：“毛泽东思想是千真万确的革命理论。毛泽东思想不仅照耀着中国革命的道路，也照耀着世界革命的道路。”一位苏联士兵说：“毛泽东同志是真正伟大的革命家，是活着的列宁。”三位格鲁吉亚工人无限深情地说：“毛泽东同志是世界革命人民的救星和希望，是我们最亲的亲人。”
    苏联人民必将奋起推翻苏修反动统治
    毛主席经常指出：革命的政党，革命的人民，总是要反复地经受正反两个方面的教育，经过比较和对照，才能够锻炼得成熟起来，才有赢得胜利的保证。
    越来越多的苏联革命人民，通过对中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大胜利和在苏联复辟资本主义的历史悲剧的比较和分析，正在用战无不胜的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来，政治上有了进一步的觉醒。
    经过中国的无产阶级文化大革命，苏联革命人民进一步识破了苏修领导集团长期的欺骗宣传，认识到赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流正是苏联的资产阶级当权派，认识到这一小撮叛徒在“共产主义建设”的旗号下，在苏联全面复辟资本主义的罪行。他们越来越认识到毛主席所教导的伟大真理：革命的根本问题是政权问题。有了政权就有了一切，没有政权就丧失一切。他们愤怒地指出：“勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团背叛了马克思列宁主义，背叛了列宁的道路，把苏联拉上了资本主义的道路”。“无产阶级专政，劳动阶级的政权，在苏联已经不存在了”，“国家权力现在掌握在人民的敌人手里”、“资产阶级代理人的手里”。
    经过中国无产阶级文化大革命，苏联革命人民越来越懂得，苏联广大劳动人民同苏修领导集团之间的矛盾，是当前苏联社会的主要矛盾，这个矛盾是不可调和的对抗性的阶级矛盾，是你死我活的斗争。他们纷纷控诉说，在苏修领导集团的反动统治下，苏联的阶级分化日益加剧，贫富悬殊的鸿沟越来越深。他们说：“现在苏联的‘领导人’同十月革命前的资本家和地主一样。”这些人“不劳动，却收入很多，普通职工受他们的剥削”。
    苏联革命人民若干年来采取各种各样的方式同苏修叛徒集团进行了坚决的斗争。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命大大鼓舞了他们的战斗意志。他们认识到，为了重建无产阶级专政，必须在苏联进行第二次革命，彻底摧毁苏修的反动统治。一位苏联工人说，我要在全国各地宣传革命真理，唤起苏联人民起来革命，走列宁、斯大林和毛泽东的革命道路。一位苏共普通党员不久前对中国同志指出：“苏联人民一定会起来进行第二次革命，把苏修领导集团赶下台。苏联人民一定会胜利。”另一位苏联工人说，“在苏联一定要进行第二次革命，我们要学习中国红卫兵的造反精神，造勃列日涅夫、柯西金等一小撮的反，重新建立一个无产阶级专政的苏维埃社会主义共和国。”苏联的一个革命组织“斯大林小组”最近庄严宣布要在苏联进行一场革命，“推翻苏联蜕化变质分子（新资产阶级分子）的政权”，充分表现了苏联无产阶级的英雄气概和进行无产阶级革命的决心。
    现在，世界已经进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。全世界的革命斗争，正呈现出新的高涨。篡夺了十月革命果实的苏修叛徒集团，目前面临着内外交困、分崩离析的局面，他们的日子越来越不好过，正在进行垂死挣扎。苏联人民日益觉醒，正在采取各种各样的办法同苏修叛徒集团进行斗争。正如伟大的革命导师列宁所教导的，“不论革命如何困难或可能遭到暂时失利，不论反革命的浪潮如何高涨，无产阶级的最后胜利是不可避免的。”苏修叛徒们绝对阻止不了历史车轮的前进，十月革命的事业必将在苏联获得最后的胜利。
