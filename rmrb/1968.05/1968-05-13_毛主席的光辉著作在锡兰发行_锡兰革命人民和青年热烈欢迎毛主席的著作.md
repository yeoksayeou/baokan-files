Chairman Mao's brilliant works have recently been translated into Sinhala and Tamil and published as separate volumes in Ceylon, where they have been warmly welcomed by the revolutionary people of Ceylon.

The Ceylon People's Publishing House has published the following works in Sinhala: "Talk with the American Correspondent Anna Louise Strong," "To Be Attacked by the Enemy Is Not a Bad Thing but a Good Thing," "Organize," and "Oppose Book Worship." The same publisher has also released "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War" in Tamil.

Chairman Mao's brilliant works have been enthusiastically welcomed by the revolutionary people and youth of Ceylon. University student Aydirisinha wrote in a letter to Chinese comrades: "Chairman Mao is the reddest sun in the hearts of revolutionary people. The world revolution relies on the application of Mao Zedong Thought." He expressed his determination: "I vow to be a good student of Chairman Mao." Young Rajapakse wrote: "The 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' have led me onto the correct path. Chairman Mao is the great leader of the people of the world."
