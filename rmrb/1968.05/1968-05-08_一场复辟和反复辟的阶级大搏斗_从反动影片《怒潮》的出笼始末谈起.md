A Great Class Struggle of Restoration and Anti-Restoration
— Starting with the Origins of the Reactionary Film *Stormy Waves*

For over a decade, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie have engaged in a sharp and complex class struggle centered around the reactionary film *Stormy Waves*.

The ambitious and scheming traitor Peng Dehuai, in order to realize his evil plot of usurping the military and the party, and "ruling China alone," has always belittled the great significance of the Autumn Harvest Uprising led by Chairman Mao. He has exaggerated the role of the Pingjiang Uprising, shamelessly claiming: "Before 1928, the revolution was in a low tide, and the Pingjiang Uprising was the 'signal of the revolutionary tide.'" He attempted to rewrite military history to portray himself as the representative of the "correct line" and the founder of our army. In 1958, when the entire nation was marching forward under the three red banners, Peng Dehuai, to launch an attack on the party, used the pretext of a "rural investigation" to visit Pingjiang. On one hand, he sought out the "dark side" from the sunlight to gather materials for his anti-party "opinion book," and on the other hand, he conducted so-called commemorative activities for the 30th anniversary of the Pingjiang Uprising to create public opinion for his military and party usurpation. This person, who claimed to be a "coarse but not detailed" Zhang Fei, fully understood the importance of seizing the pen and creating public opinion. He said, "The Pingjiang Uprising should be well written, and I can provide the materials." He also said, "If you write about me, you can write: brave in fighting the enemy, a brave son of a peasant."

Peng Dehuai's accomplices, following their master's orders, immediately sprang into action. The main creators of the reactionary film *Stormy Waves* gathered spies, traitors, and demons to compile the *History of the Pingjiang Revolutionary Struggle*, write memoirs, set up exhibitions, and produce film scripts, all to build a monument for the traitor Peng Dehuai. In the initial draft of *Stormy Waves*, titled *Pingjiang Stormy Waves*, the creators blatantly praised the "Pingjiang Uprising" as the "signal of the revolutionary tide" and glorified a former warlord who joined the revolutionary forces with the idea of "investing" as the "leader" of the Pingjiang peasant movement and the "founder" of our army. The main creator of the film had to admit, "I elevated Peng Dehuai's image and belittled Chairman Mao's." "I wrote about 200,000 peasants storming the city as 'leftist adventurism,' and after entering the city, going to Jinggangshan as Peng Dehuai's 'leftist adventurism.'" Isn't this openly raising the black flag, chopping down the red flag, and attempting to use Peng Dehuai's consistent bourgeois reactionary line to negate and oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

However, things did not go as planned. In 1959, Peng Dehuai's ferocious attack on the party at the Lushan Conference was thoroughly smashed by our great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. The anti-party clique led by Peng Dehuai, including Huang Kecheng, Zhang Wentian, and Zhou Xiaozhou, was removed from office. However, Peng Dehuai's accomplices were not willing to accept their defeat. They harbored deep hatred for the party and Mao Zedong Thought, constantly trying to rehabilitate Peng Dehuai.

In 1962, the Chinese Khrushchev, while inciting demons to attack the party, also stirred up a wind to rehabilitate Peng Dehuai. He maliciously attacked the struggle at the Lushan Conference as an "erroneous and excessive struggle," claiming that Peng Dehuai "did not make a mistake." The main creator of the film, to adapt to this counter-revolutionary need, hastily released the *History of the Pingjiang Revolutionary Struggle* to build a monument for Peng Dehuai, and at the same time, with his accomplices, carefully revised the sixth draft of *Stormy Waves* to add content for rehabilitation: first, adding the scene of the representative of the correct line, Luo Dacheng, being removed from office, which was not in the previous drafts, to blatantly plead for Peng Dehuai; second, adding the image of the "upright soldier" Huang Weiguo to exonerate Peng Dehuai's evil history; third, the appearance of the creator's ghost, the fisherman drummer, and the fisherman drum words to express the counter-revolutionaries' desire for restoration; fourth, following the instructions of the blackline leader Zhou Yang in literature and art: "Do not be restricted by real people and real events," the film's central event "storming the city" was covered with the cloak of the "Autumn Harvest Uprising," and the film script was finally changed from the original title *Pingjiang Stormy Waves* to *Stormy Waves*, in order to wave the "red flag" against the red flag. After these manipulations, the script fully met the political needs of the bourgeois headquarters to rehabilitate Peng Dehuai.

To promote this reactionary script that expresses the "anger" of being removed from office and the "wave" of overturning the case, the walking capitalists of the August First Film Studio, under the repeated urgings of Zhou Yang and Luo Ronghuan, broke the rules and hastily sent out the director before the script was finalized, and made all preparations for shooting. The main creator of *Stormy Waves* immediately moved his "command post" to Pingjiang, personally supervising the "frontline" battle. Thus, this poisonous weed sprouted in the midst of the bourgeois headquarters' frenzied counterattack, along with its sister works *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* and *Xie Yaohuan*.

As soon as the film was released, it immediately received praise from the largest clique of walking capitalists within the party. The ambitious and scheming traitor Luo Ronghuan enthusiastically praised it as "the best film of 1963." The counter-revolutionary hypocrite Tao Zhu patted the main creator of the film on the shoulder, praising him, "You can become a scholar." The performance of these ambitious and scheming traitors, forgetting themselves in their joy, shows that this film fully expresses their common anti-party wish.

However, the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, presided over by Chairman Mao, smashed Peng Dehuai's second mad counterattack. Chairman Mao issued the battle call to "never forget class struggle." The evil plot of the main creator of the film to release the *History of the Pingjiang Revolutionary Struggle* was exposed, and the reactionary film *Stormy Waves* to rehabilitate Peng Dehuai began to be exposed by the revolutionary masses. However, the ambitious and scheming traitor Luo Ronghuan quickly jumped out to try to cover up this incident, saying that "the author is the author, and the film is the film," attempting to only delete the name of Peng Dehuai's accomplice in the opening credits to allow the film to be screened again, continuing to use literature and art to carry out capitalist restoration activities. The old propaganda department demons, Yu Dingyi and Zhou Yang, after Chairman Mao's two instructions on literature and art were issued, still tried every means to cover up the anti-party film *Stormy Waves*. They used one side to stop the screening and the other side to arrange for the walking capitalists of the August First Film Studio to conduct a fake investigation to "clarify the matter," in order to destroy the evidence, cover up the retreat, and once again attempt to cover up the truth of the *Stormy Waves* anti-party incident!

However, as our great leader Chairman Mao taught: "If they want to counter-revolute, they cannot completely hide their true selves." In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought finally exposed the reactionary film *Stormy Waves* to the public.

This decade-long struggle on the literary and artistic front is a life-and-death struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, between the two classes and the two headquarters, a struggle of restoration and anti-restoration! We proletarian revolutionaries must rise up with the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the reactionary film *Stormy Waves* and its creators, along with their black backers, the Chinese Khrushchev, Peng Dehuai, and the like, and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

　　一场复辟和反复辟的阶级大搏斗
　　——从反动影片《怒潮》的出笼始末谈起
    八一电影制片厂无产阶级革命派
    十多年来，无产阶级同资产阶级围绕着反动影片《怒潮》，展开了一场尖锐复杂的阶级大搏斗。
    大野心家、大阴谋家彭德怀，为了实现其篡军反党、“独得中华”的罪恶阴谋，一向贬低毛主席亲自领导的秋收起义的伟大意义，极力夸大平江起义的作用。他恬不知耻地说：一九二八年以前处于革命低潮，平江起义是“革命来潮的信号”。他妄图通过篡改军史，把自己打扮成“正确路线”的代表和我军的“创始人”。一九五八年当全国人民在三面红旗的光辉照耀下昂首阔步前进的时候，彭德怀为了发动向党进攻，他以“农村调查”为名，亲临平江：一方面从太阳的光辉下寻找所谓阴暗面，为反党“意见书”搜集材料，另一方面进行“平江起义”三十周年的所谓纪念活动，为他篡军、篡党大造舆论。这个自称为“只有其粗、而无其细”的张飞式的人物，十分懂得抓笔杆、造舆论的重要。他说：“平江暴动要好好写一写，材料我可以提供。”又说：“要写我的话，可以这样写：对敌斗争勇敢，是一个勇敢的农民的儿子。”
    彭德怀的死党，秉承其主子的旨意，立即应声而起。反动影片《怒潮》的主要炮制者，大肆收罗特务、叛徒和牛鬼蛇神，通过编《平江革命斗争史》，写回忆录，办展览馆，搞电影剧本，全力为反党篡军大野心家彭德怀树碑立传。在反动影片《怒潮》的初稿《平江怒潮》中，炮制者明目张胆地把“平江起义”吹捧为“革命来潮的信号”，把一个带着“入股”投机思想混入革命部队的旧军阀美化为平江农民运动的“领袖”和“我军的创始人”。影片的主要炮制者不得不承认：“我把彭德怀的形象抬高了，贬低了毛主席”，“我写二十万农民扑城是写了‘左’倾盲动主义，打进城后上井冈山是写彭德怀的‘左’倾盲动主义。”这不是公然树黑旗，砍红旗，妄图以彭德怀一贯推行的资产阶级反动路线来否定和反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线吗！
    但是，事与愿违。一九五九年彭德怀在庐山会议上向党发动的一场猖狂进攻，被我们伟大领袖毛主席和党中央彻底粉碎了。以彭德怀为首的反党集团，包括黄克诚、张闻天、周小舟这一小撮反党分子被罢了官。然而那些彭德怀的死党，决不甘心于他们的失败。他们怀着对党、对毛泽东思想的刻骨仇恨，时时刻刻妄图为彭德怀翻案。
    一九六二年，中国赫鲁晓夫在煽动牛鬼蛇神向党进攻的同时，刮起了一股为彭德怀翻案的妖风。他恶毒地攻击庐山会议的斗争是“错误的过火的斗争”，说彭德怀“并不算犯错误”。影片的主要炮制者为了适应这种反革命的需要，一方面急急忙忙地抛出为彭德怀树碑立传的《平江革命斗争史》，另一方面又跟他的同伙挖空心思地在《怒潮》的第六稿中作了几处重大的修改，以增添翻案的内容：一、增添了前几稿所没有的，所谓正确路线代表人物罗大成被罢官的情节，借此明目张胆地为彭德怀鸣冤叫屈；二、增加了为彭德怀罪恶历史开脱的“正直军人”黄维国的形象；三、出现了炮制者的幽灵渔鼓老人和为点明主题、抒发这些反革命分子复辟野心的一些渔鼓词；四、按照文艺黑线总头目周扬的指点：“不要受真人真事的限制”，给影片的中心事件“扑城”，披上了“秋收起义”的外衣，并将电影剧本由原名《平江怒潮》最后改为《怒潮》，以便打着“红旗”反红旗。经过这几番手脚，剧本就完全符合资产阶级司令部为彭德怀翻案的政治需要了。
    为了促使这部发泄被罢官之“怒”、掀翻案之“潮”的反动剧本，配合彭德怀的反党八万言书一起抛出，八一电影制片厂的走资派，在周扬和罗瑞卿的黑干将三令五申、一再催促下，竟破例在剧本定稿之前就匆忙地派出了导演，并作好一切拍摄准备。《怒潮》的主要炮制者也立即将他的“指挥所”搬到平江，亲临“前线”督战。于是，这株大毒草就在资产阶级司令部又一次猖狂反扑的紧锣密鼓声中，与它的姐妹篇《海瑞罢官》《谢瑶环》一起问世了。
    影片一出笼，立即得到党内最大一小撮走资派的喝采。篡军反党大野心家罗瑞卿兴高采烈地称赞它是“一九六三年最好的影片”。反革命两面派陶铸也拍着影片主要炮制者的肩膀，夸奖他“可变成个秀才了”。这些野心家、阴谋家得意忘形的表演，说明这部影片充分表达了他们反党的共同心愿。
    但是，毛主席亲自主持的八届十中全会粉碎了彭德怀的又一次疯狂反扑。毛主席发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的战斗号召。影片主要炮制者策划抛出《平江革命斗争史》的罪恶阴谋败露了，而替彭德怀翻案的反动影片《怒潮》也开始为革命群众所揭发。但是篡军反党大野心家罗瑞卿急忙跳出来极力捂住这个盖子，说什么“作者是作者，影片是影片”，妄图仅仅在片头删去彭德怀死党的名字，以便再行上映，继续利用文艺进行资本主义复辟活动。而旧中宣部阎王陆定一、周扬，在毛主席关于文学艺术两次批示下达后，对反党影片《怒潮》仍然千方百计地进行包庇。他们采用了一面停映，一面布置八一电影制片厂走资派搞假调查，来进行所谓“澄清这个事情”，以便消尸灭迹，掩护退却，又一次妄图把《怒潮》反党事件的真相掩盖起来！
    但是，正如我们伟大领袖毛主席教导的：“他们既要反革命，就不可能将其真象荫蔽得十分彻底”。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派，终于把反动影片《怒潮》揪出来示众了。
    这一场延续十年之久的文艺战线上的斗争，是资产阶级同无产阶级这两个阶级、两个司令部之间一场复辟反复辟的生死搏斗！我们无产阶级革命派，必须奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，彻底批判反动影片《怒潮》及其炮制者连同他们的黑后台中国赫鲁晓夫、彭德怀之流，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
