Resolutely Support the Just Struggles of the People of France and Europe and North America
Massive Demonstrations Held in Seven Major Cities

The revolutionary masses in the capital, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Guangzhou highly praise the revolutionary struggles of the working class and laboring people in France and Western Europe and North America. They point out: This massive struggle is a continuation of the Paris Commune's revolutionary struggle in the 1960s, a prominent sign of the excellent situation in the world revolution, and a powerful blow to U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries. They unanimously declare: We resolutely unite with the revolutionary people of all countries to bury the imperialist-revisionist-reactionary clique in the grave.

According to Xinhua News Agency, on May 22, more than 700,000 revolutionary masses in the capital took to the streets today, holding an even more massive demonstration to resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the French workers and students and the just struggles of the people in Europe and North America.

In the massive demonstration, there were workers, Red Guards, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, residents, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing. Early this morning, the demonstrators, holding red flags and carrying portraits of Chairman Mao, surged in groups towards the central streets of the city and Tiananmen Square. The demonstrators held the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting: "Workers of the world, unite!" "Workers of the world and all oppressed peoples and nations, unite!" "Resolutely support the revolutionary struggle of the French people!" "Resolutely support the just struggles of the workers and students in Europe, America, and Oceania!" "Resolutely support the liberation struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America!" "Long live the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune!" The revolutionary masses participating in the demonstration highly praised the great revolutionary action of the eight million French workers going on strike. They said, whatever the enemy opposes, we support. The revolutionary actions of the French workers and students are excellent. The imperialist-revisionist-reactionary clique fiercely opposes and suppresses them, so we must resolutely support and support them! We, the liberated people of China, following the teachings of Chairman Mao, will always be heart-to-heart with the French people and all oppressed peoples of the world!

The workers participating in today's demonstration in the capital come from various industries such as steel, coal, machinery, textiles, transportation, urban construction, commerce, and services. Many coal miners just came out of the pits and did not even change their work clothes before joining the demonstration. The miners enthusiastically cheered for the revolutionary struggles of the French working class and laboring people. They expressed their determination to support the just struggles of the people in Europe and North America with actual actions of seizing the revolution and promoting production. The miners said, supporting the world revolution is our sacred internationalist duty of the proletariat. The struggles of the European and North American workers are our struggles. The working class of the world should unite, use our iron fists to smash the old world to pieces, and bury imperialism, modern revisionism, and all devils that eat people in the grave!

Workers from various industries also held meetings, where they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings: "We must unite with the proletariat of all capitalist countries, with the proletariat of Japan, Britain, the United States, Germany, Italy, and all capitalist countries, to overthrow imperialism and liberate our nation and people, and liberate the nations and peoples of the world." The workers raised their arms and shouted: "All Marxists-Leninists of the world unite in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism!" "Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

Today, more primary and secondary school Red Guards and revolutionary students in the capital held meetings and demonstrations. Many schools' Red Guards repeatedly and seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The people who have already won the revolution should aid the struggles of the people who are fighting for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." They said, Chairman Mao instructs me to do it, Chairman Mao waves his hand, and I advance. The revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries have always been mutually supportive and inspiring. The rapid development of the workers' and students' movements in Europe and North America will accelerate the collapse of the reactionary rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie led by the United States. We are Chairman Mao's Red Guards. We must carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, supporting the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries with actual actions.

Revolutionary cadres from central and Beijing municipal organs also participated in today's demonstration. They enthusiastically praised the heroic spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win of the French workers and students.

Among the demonstrators, there were many revolutionary residents who held red flags and shouted: "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Down with the reactionaries of all countries!" They said, all laboring people in the world are one family. The workers and students in France and Europe and North America have risen to struggle, which is a great encouragement to us. We resolutely support them.

The soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing today demonstrated with the revolutionary masses of the capital. Before dawn, they held up giant portraits of Chairman Mao, carried red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and marched out of their offices and barracks towards the city center and Tiananmen Square. The soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, enthusiastically praised the just struggles of the workers and students in Europe and North America. The soldiers and officers, together with the workers and Red Guards demonstrating side by side, loudly read Chairman Mao's quotations: "All the peoples of the world, unite more closely, launch a sustained and vigorous offensive against our common enemy, U.S. imperialism and its accomplices! It can be asserted that the thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation, and the thorough emancipation of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world, are not far off." They firmly believe that with the support of the people of all countries in the world, the surging tide of the people's movement in Europe and North America will roll on irresistibly, and the final victory will surely belong to the working class and laboring people of Europe, North America, and the world!

According to Xinhua News Agency, in the midst of the triumphant songs of the victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, more than two million workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary masses, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Guangzhou today, with the revolutionary enthusiasm of the proletariat, held massive meetings and demonstrations. They resolutely support the just struggles of the Paris workers, students, and all revolutionary people of France, and the just struggles of the people in Europe and North America. The broad revolutionary masses and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army carried the giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, held red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," held red flags, sang revolutionary songs, and repeatedly shouted: "Resolutely support the revolutionary struggle of the French people!" "Resolutely support the just struggles of the workers and students in Europe, America, and Oceania!" "Resolutely support the liberation struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the world!" "Resolutely support the just war of national liberation of the great Vietnamese people!" "Workers of the world, unite!" "Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

The broad revolutionary masses and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army participating in the meetings and demonstrations pointed out that the new upsurge of the people's movement in Europe and North America is a prominent sign of the excellent situation in the world revolution. The surging people's movement in the heart of the capitalist world has dealt a new and powerful blow to the imperialist, Soviet revisionist traitor clique led by the United States, and the reactionaries of various countries, and has given great encouragement and support to the revolutionary people of various countries and the broad revolutionary masses of China who are achieving the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. They highly praised the progressive student movement in Europe and North America, which is gradually merging with the workers' movement, showing great power. They expressed that the Chinese people are determined to unite with the revolutionary people of all countries in the world to launch a sustained and vigorous offensive against imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, and the reactionaries of various countries.

Today, Shanghai, the largest industrial city in China with a glorious revolutionary tradition, more than 500,000 workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, carried forward the spirit of proletarian internationalism, and held a massive meeting and demonstration. The broad revolutionary masses and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army surged from all directions towards the city center's People's Square to hold a massive meeting of the revolutionary people of Shanghai resolutely supporting the just struggles of the people of France and Europe and North America.

The meeting issued a telegram of the revolutionary people of Shanghai resolutely supporting the just struggles of the people of France and Europe and North America. After the meeting, a massive demonstration was held. The people in the suburbs of Shanghai also held meetings and demonstrations today.

The working class and broad revolutionary masses of Shanghai have been closely watching the revolutionary struggles of the French workers and students. When they learned that France already has eight million workers on strike, they were greatly encouraged. They highly praised the just struggles of the French working class. The revolutionary workers were extremely excited and said, the great teacher Mao Zedong teaches us: "Where there is oppression, there is resistance." The French working class with the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune has launched a fierce attack on the decaying capitalist system, shaking the reactionary rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie led by the United States, greatly boosting the morale of the proletariat of all countries, and greatly demoralizing the imperialist led by the United States, the modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, and the reactionaries of various countries. We, the working class of Shanghai, resolutely support the just struggles of our French worker brothers! The broad Red Guards said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "Intellectuals, if they do not combine with the workers and peasants, will accomplish nothing." Currently, the massive student movement in France is combining with the increasingly vigorous workers' movement in France. The progressive students of France have taken the right path, thus making the revolutionary people of France into an irresistible torrent, which is even more powerful in striking the entire France and shaking the capitalist world. We resolutely support the just struggles of the French students and revolutionary people. The soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai pointed out that the just struggles of the French working class and progressive students further prove that the people of Europe and all countries in the world are increasingly awakening. We firmly believe that no matter how the French reactionaries and modern revisionist clique sabotage and disrupt, the final victory will surely belong to the heroic French people.

More than 500,000 workers, Red Guards, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in Tianjin, an important industrial city in China, held a massive demonstration today. From the banks of the Haihe River to the new port of Tanggu, red flags were flying everywhere, and large banners were pasted all over the streets. The demonstrators highly praised the just struggles of the French workers and students. The revolutionary workers of Tianjin said, our experience in China's working class fighting under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought proves that only by carrying forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat and smashing the old world to pieces can we build a new world. The demonstrators also pointed out that the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries have always been mutually supportive and inspiring. We, under the guidance of the radiant Mao Zedong Thought, will support the just struggles of the French workers and students and the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries with actual actions of seizing the revolution and promoting production to achieve the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. The Tianjin Municipal Workers' Congress, Farmers' Congress, Higher Education Red Guards' Congress, and Middle School Red Guards' Congress today issued a statement, resolutely supporting the just struggles of the French workers and students.

More than 300,000 workers, Red Guards, revolutionary masses, and soldiers and officers of the PLA stationed in Shenyang held demonstrations today. Teams of demonstrators marched to the streets. The revolutionary workers of Shenyang said, the just struggles of the French workers and revolutionary people are a continuation of the revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune in the 1960s. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The oppressed peoples fighting for complete liberation rely first of all on their own struggle, and only then on international aid. The people who have already won the revolution should aid the struggles of the people who are fighting for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." The broad masses of workers expressed that we, the working class of the Mao Zedong era in China, will resolutely unite with all proletarians and oppressed peoples and nations in the world to launch a sustained and vigorous offensive against imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, and the reactionaries of various countries. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Shenyang, after hearing the inspiring news of the revolutionary struggles of the French workers and students, held demonstrations with deep proletarian feelings for all oppressed peoples in the world. They said: Although we are far away from France, we are always heart-to-heart with the French working class and revolutionary students. We resolutely support the just struggles of the French workers and students. The broad Red Guards of Shenyang firmly expressed that they would learn from the high internationalist spirit of Comrade Norman Bethune and support the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world with a heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao.

More than 200,000 workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in Nanjing today, with the revolutionary enthusiasm of the proletariat, held a grand meeting and demonstration. The revolutionary masses surged from all directions towards the meeting venue. The meeting, on behalf of the 1.7 million people of Nanjing, expressed the most resolute support for the revolutionary struggles of the French workers and students, the revolutionary struggles of the workers and students in all countries in Europe and North America, and the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world against imperialism and revisionism. They said, the current era is an era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory. The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "It can be asserted that the thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation, and the thorough emancipation of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world, are not far off." We believe that the French working class and laboring people with the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune, and the working class and laboring people in other European and North American countries in the heart of the capitalist world, will surely combine their struggles with the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, forming a surging revolutionary torrent to thoroughly smash the sinister capitalist system and bury imperialism, modern revisionism, and all devils that eat people. The meeting read out the telegram "Resolutely support the just struggles of the people of France and Europe and North America." After the meeting, a massive demonstration was held.

Today, in Wuhan, a city with a glorious revolutionary tradition, more than 200,000 workers, Red Guards, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, residents, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army held demonstrations in Hankou, Hanyang, and Wuchang respectively. The broad revolutionary workers of the Wuhan region said, we, the working class, firmly believe that the revolutionary struggles of the French workers and revolutionary people will surely advance from victory to victory along the revolutionary principles of the Paris Commune, and the revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune will surely be further carried forward and developed. The railway workers of the Hankou Jianghan area, the birthplace of the "February 7th" strike, highly praised the revolutionary struggles of the French workers. They said, the French workers and students with revolutionary traditions have developed to a new stage, and the revolutionary students have taken the path of combining with the workers' movement, forming an irresistible revolutionary torrent that has shaken the entire France and the capitalist world. Their revolutionary actions are excellent! We railway workers, who have personally suffered from the oppression and exploitation of imperialism and the bourgeoisie, best understand the significance of the revolutionary struggles of the French working class. We resolutely support them.

Today, in Guangzhou, a city with a glorious revolutionary tradition, more than 200,000 revolutionary workers, Red Guards, revolutionary students, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army took to the streets to hold meetings and demonstrations. The broad revolutionary masses at the meeting enthusiastically praised the just struggles of the French working class and progressive students with a glorious revolutionary tradition, as well as the just struggles of the people in Europe and North America. The revolutionary workers of Guangzhou said, we, the 500,000 workers of Guangzhou, are closely related to the French working class. We will continue to closely watch the revolutionary struggles of the French workers and students. The Red Guards and revolutionary students and staff of the Guangzhou region, full of revolutionary passion, expressed their determination to stand firmly with the French working class and progressive students, supporting their just struggles. The soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army participating in the demonstration excitedly said, "The seas are boiling with clouds and anger, and the continents are shaking with thunder and lightning." The current world situation is excellent. The revolutionary tide is something that imperialism, modern revisionism, and any reactionary forces cannot stop. The future of Europe, America, and Oceania belongs to the broad masses of these regions, not to the reactionaries. We believe that the revolutionary people of these regions will surely sweep away the decaying capitalist system and achieve the final victory of the revolution.

    具有光荣革命传统的武汉三镇，今天有二十多万工人、红卫兵、革命师生、革命干部、街道居民和人民解放军指战员，分别在汉口、汉阳、武昌举行示威游行。武汉地区广大革命工人说，我们工人阶级坚信，法国工人和革命人民的革命斗争必将沿着巴黎公社的革命原则从胜利走向胜利，巴黎公社的革命斗争传统一定会更加发扬光大。“二七”大罢工的策源地——汉口江岸地区的铁路工人高度赞扬法国工人的革命斗争。他们说，具有革命传统的法国工人和学生的正义斗争，已经发展到了一个新的阶段，革命的学生走向同工人运动相结合的道路，汇成了一股不可抗拒的革命洪流，冲击了整个法国，震撼了资本主义世界，他们的革命行动好得很！我们亲身受过帝国主义、资产阶级剥削压迫的铁路工人，最理解法国工人阶级革命斗争的意义，我们坚决支持他们。
    具有光荣革命传统的广州市，二十多万革命工人、红卫兵、革命师生、贫下中农、革命干部和人民解放军指战员，涌向街头，举行集会和示威游行。广大革命群众在集会上热烈赞扬说，具有光荣革命传统的法国工人阶级和进步学生的正义斗争，以及欧洲、北美各国人民的正义斗争，震撼了以美国为首的各国垄断资产阶级的反动统治，给予了各国革命人民和正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的中国广大革命群众以巨大的支持和鼓舞。广州的革命工人们说，我们广州五十万工人和法国工人阶级息息相关，我们将继续密切注视着法国工人和学生的革命斗争。广州地区的红卫兵战士和革命师生员工，满怀着革命激情表示，坚决站在法国工人阶级和进步学生一边，支持他们的正义斗争。参加示威游行的人民解放军指战员兴奋地说，“四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。”当前世界形势一片大好。革命的潮流，是帝国主义、现代修正主义和任何反动势力都阻挡不住的。欧洲、美洲、大洋洲的未来，是属于这个地区的广大人民的，绝不是属于反动派的。我们相信，这些地区的革命人民一定能够扫除腐朽的资本主义制度，取得革命的最后胜利。
