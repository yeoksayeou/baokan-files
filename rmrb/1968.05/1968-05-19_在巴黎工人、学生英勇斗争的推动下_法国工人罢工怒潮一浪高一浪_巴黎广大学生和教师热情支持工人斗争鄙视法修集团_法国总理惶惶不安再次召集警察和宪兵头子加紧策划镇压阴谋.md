Under the impetus of the brave struggle of Paris workers and students, the wave of French workers' strikes continues to surge, sweeping across all of France. In various parts of France, more and more workers, inspired by the struggle of Paris workers and students, have taken to occupying factories, mines, and enterprises, detaining management personnel, and engaging in indefinite political and economic strikes.

Driven by the unprecedented surge of the student movement in France, the workers' movement has developed with astonishing speed. According to reports from Western news agencies, the number of workers on strike reached approximately 100,000 in the morning of the 17th, increased to 300,000 by noon, and reached 500,000 by the afternoon. The strike wave quickly swept through the steel, shipbuilding, automobile, defense, textile, and mining industries, severely disrupting national transportation and other sectors. French Industrial Minister Giscard d'Estaing exclaimed, "The situation is extremely serious." Currently, the strike wave continues to surge and roll forward.

Another characteristic of this strike struggle is that the vast majority of French workers, despite the opposition of the revisionist trade union leaders, have taken the initiative to act in a combative manner, occupying their factories, mines, and enterprises, declaring indefinite strikes, and detaining bosses and management personnel who refuse to accept workers' demands.

The 66,000 workers of France's largest automobile monopoly, the state-owned Renault Automobile Company, continue to occupy all the company's factories. The 2,500 workers of the aircraft manufacturing plant of the French aircraft company in Nantes have been occupying the factory for four days. The workers of the company's Saint-Nazaire plant also went on strike on the 17th. The 7,000 workers of the Rodiaceta-Vesoul textile factory near Lyon have taken over the factory. Tens of thousands of workers have occupied the Berliet-Vignat truck factory near Lyon. Miners have occupied a uranium mine in central France and many other mines in other regions.

In the past two days, French railway workers have spontaneously occupied stations and other facilities, causing France's national railway transportation to come to a halt. The workers of Paris's largest international airport, Orly, have occupied the airport facilities and gone on strike, forcing Air France to suspend all flights. Paris's striking bus workers have occupied some depots, forcing the French government to deploy military trucks to transport passengers.

The employees of the government-controlled French Radio and Television, the mouthpiece of the French government, held a meeting on the evening of the 17th and decided to go on strike, with the strike committee determining the manner and start time of the strike. The reporters of French Radio and Television also decided on the same day that they would no longer accept "any instructions" from the French government regarding news reporting. The strike of French postal workers continues. The distribution centers for newspapers in Paris and Lyon have been occupied by workers, making it impossible to deliver newspapers.

Paris students and teachers attach great importance to and enthusiastically support the workers' occupation of factories. The leaders of the French revisionist trade unions, who have repeatedly attacked the Paris student movement, have openly come out against students going to the factory districts. Paris students have pointed out that this does not represent the demands of the workers. More than 5,000 Paris students, on the 17th, once again marched from the University of Paris across the city to the Renault factory in the western suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt, expressing their support for the tens of thousands of workers occupying the factory. The students, carrying red flags, sang the "Internationale" and chanted slogans such as "Workers and students unite," "Long live the workers' struggle," and "Down with the police state" along the way. The students' procession was warmly welcomed by the striking workers. Workers and students held a meeting together in front of the factory and discussed the workers' movement and the student movement in small groups.

The rapid development of the workers' movement has made the French ruling class anxious. French Information Minister Gorse announced on the 18th that French President Charles de Gaulle, who is currently on an overseas visit, will return to Paris ahead of schedule to deal with the "increasingly deteriorating social situation in France." French Prime Minister Georges Pompidou is sleepless and has been staying in his office all night. On the morning of the 18th, Pompidou convened an emergency meeting with the ministers of industry, transportation, postal services, armed forces, and interior affairs, as well as the heads of the police and gendarmerie. Currently, Paris is filled with military and police presence, as if on the verge of a major conflict. Large numbers of fully armed gendarmes and police are controlling the main bridges over the Seine River, guarding radio stations, airports, government agencies, and other important locations, preparing to deal with the workers and students.

    法国工人罢工怒潮一浪高一浪

    法国总理惶惶不安再次召集警察和宪兵头子加紧策划镇压阴谋
    新华社十八日讯　巴黎消息：法国工人罢工的怒潮继续高涨，迅速席卷全法国。法国各地越来越多的工人，在巴黎工人、学生英勇斗争的推动下，奋起占领工厂、矿山和企业，扣留资方人员，并举行无限期的政治和经济罢工。
    在法国空前高涨的学生运动的推动下，法国工人运动的发展迅猛异常。据西方通讯社报道，十七日上午参加罢工的工人约十万人，中午增加到三十万，下午已达五十万。罢工的浪潮迅速席卷了钢铁、造船、汽车、军备、纺织、采矿等企业，同时严重打击了全国的交通运输等行业。法国工业部长吉夏尔惊呼“局势极端严重”。目前，罢工的浪潮仍在迅速高涨，滚滚向前。
    这次罢工斗争的另一个特点是，法国广大的工人，不顾法修工会头目的反对，纷纷以战斗的姿态主动地行动起来，占领他们所在的厂矿和企业，宣布无限期罢工，并且把拒绝接受工人要求的老板和资方人员扣留起来。
    法国最大的汽车垄断企业——国营雷诺汽车公司的六万六千多工人，仍在继续占领这个公司的全部工厂。法国南方飞机公司在南特的飞机制造厂的二千五百工人占领工厂已经四天。这家公司的圣纳泽尔工厂的工人十七日也举行了罢工。里昂附近的罗迪亚塞塔—韦斯纺织厂的七千多名工人接管了工厂。上万工人占领了里昂附近的贝利埃—维尼亚厄卡车厂。矿工占领了法国中部的一个铀矿和其他地区的许多矿山。
    法国的铁路工人这两天纷纷自动起来占领车站和其他设施，使得法国全国的铁路交通陷于瘫痪。巴黎最大的国际机场——奥利机场的职工也占领了机场的设施并举行罢工，使得法兰西航空公司不得不停止全部飞行。巴黎罢工的公共汽车工人则占领了一些停车场，迫使法国政府不得不出动军用卡车来载运乘客。
    法国政府的喉舌——法国广播和电视台的全体职工，十七日晚上举行了大会，决定举行罢工，由罢工委员会决定罢工的方式和开始罢工的时间。法国广播和电视台的记者，同日也决定今后不再接受法国政府对新闻报道的“任何指示”。法国邮政工人的罢工仍在继续。巴黎和里昂两个分发报纸的中心机构被工人占领，使得报纸无法递送。
    巴黎学生和教师十分重视并且热情支持工人占领工厂的斗争。一再攻击巴黎学生运动的法国修正主义集团的工会头目，却公然跳出来反对学生到工厂区去。巴黎学生们一针见血地指出，这并不代表工人们的要求。五千多巴黎学生，十七日又一次从巴黎大学横穿巴黎市区，来到西郊布洛涅—比扬古地区的雷诺工厂，对占领这个工厂的几万工人表示支持。学生们打着红旗，一路上高唱《国际歌》，高呼“工人学生团结起来”，“工人斗争万岁”，“打倒警察国家”等口号。学生的队伍受到罢工工人热烈的欢迎。工人和学生们在工厂前一起开了会，并分成许多小组讨论工人运动和学生运动等问题。
    工人运动的急剧发展使法国统治集团惶惶不安。法国宣传部长戈尔斯十八日宣布，正在国外进行访问的法国总统戴高乐将提前赶回巴黎，以应付“法国越来越恶化的社会局势”。法国总理蓬皮杜寝食不安，通宵守在办公室里。十八日上午，蓬皮杜召集了工业、交通运输、邮电、武装部队和内政等部长，以及警察和宪兵头子再次举行紧急会议。目前，巴黎军警林立，如临大敌。大批全副武装的宪兵、警察控制着塞纳河上主要的桥梁，把守着电台、机场、政府机关和其他重要地点，准备对付工人和学生。（附图片）
