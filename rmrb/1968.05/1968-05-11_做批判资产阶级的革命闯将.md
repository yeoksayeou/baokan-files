As we celebrate the second anniversary of the great leader Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," we must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and become revolutionary vanguards in criticizing the bourgeoisie, pushing the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

To be a revolutionary vanguard in criticizing the bourgeoisie means to strive to heighten our awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, always keeping a clear mind, and following Chairman Mao's teachings to launch a sustained and fierce offensive against the class enemy. We must resolutely carry out the directives of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, fully embody the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, resolutely oppose rightist opportunism, rightist splitism, and rightist capitulationism, and strike down the rightist wind of reversing verdicts. We must thoroughly smash all the class enemy's wild dreams of restoration and counter-revolution; we must dig out all the hidden traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionary elements.

To be a revolutionary vanguard in criticizing the bourgeoisie means to grasp the revolutionary struggle's overall direction from beginning to end and to carry out the revolutionary great criticism persistently and deeply. Therefore, we must seriously study and deeply understand the profound significance of Chairman Mao's great teachings on criticizing the bourgeoisie in all fields. Only in this way can we have a clear direction, concentrate our firepower to thoroughly criticize and expose the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents in our province, making sure that the class enemy will never have a chance to come back to life or reverse the verdict; they will never have a chance to stage a counter-revolutionary comeback.

To be a revolutionary vanguard in criticizing the bourgeoisie means to learn from and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, forging ourselves into brave fighters who are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    做批判资产阶级的革命闯将
    在欢呼伟大领袖毛主席“五·七”指示发表两周年的时候，我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，做批判资产阶级的革命闯将，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    做批判资产阶级的革命闯将，就是要努力提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，时刻保持清醒的头脑，按照毛主席的教导，主动地、持久地向阶级敌人猛烈进攻。我们必须坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的各项指示，高度发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，狠狠打击右倾翻案妖风，彻底粉碎阶级敌人的一切复辟、变天的痴心妄想；把隐藏的叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子统统挖出来。
    做批判资产阶级的革命闯将，就要自始至终掌握革命斗争的大方向，持久不懈地、深入地开展革命大批判。因此，必须认真学习、深刻领会毛主席关于各行各业都要批判资产阶级的伟大教导的深远意义。只有这样，才能方向明，集中火力把党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在我省的代理人批深批透，批倒批臭，使阶级敌人永无借尸还魂之日，永无翻案变天之时。
    做批判资产阶级的革命闯将，就是要在无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命中，活学活用毛泽东思想，把自己锻炼成为忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席革命路线的英勇战士。
