In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, our brigade started a Mao Zedong Thought study class (then called the "Three Articles" training class) in late December 1966, which later developed into classes at the production team level. Starting from last November, study classes were also organized in the homes of the commune members. Over the past year, we have always placed the task of conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes at the forefront of all our work. We conducted classes during the farming off-season and even during the busy farming season, ensuring that classes were held continuously without interruption. Through these study classes, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have developed an even deeper love for our great leader Chairman Mao and for the great thought of Mao Zedong. With Mao Zedong Thought in their minds, the poor and lower-middle peasants have broadened their horizons and brightened their eyes, becoming even more devoted to the collective and to socialism. They have broken away from the old idea of "looking near the stove, looking far at the water bridge" and established the new idea of "standing at the doorstep, looking towards Tiananmen, and thinking of the world." They have abandoned the old idea of "working for work points and farming for wealth" and formed the new custom of "working for the collective and farming for the revolution." The poor and lower-middle peasants have gradually elevated their struggle against selfishness and for the public good to the new height of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines.

"Correct ideas of the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, become a material force for changing society and the world." In 1967, our brigade suffered sabotage by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and faced a drought. However, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fought against the heavens, the earth, and the class enemies, and finally overcame the difficulties to achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest.

Our experience in conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes can be summarized in three phrases: strengthening one concept, firmly grasping the struggle between the two roads, and promoting three images.

Strengthening One Concept

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In this historical stage of socialism, there still exist classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, there is a struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and there is the danger of capitalist restoration." Class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat are the core and essence of Mao Zedong Thought. Whether or not one has the concept of class struggle is an important indicator of loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and it is also an important indicator of whether to strengthen or weaken the dictatorship of the proletariat. Only by never forgetting class struggle, by having the enemy in mind, and by having the enemy in sight, can one firmly grasp the reins of power and ensure that the ironclad mountain of the proletariat will never change color.

Following Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," our brigade's study classes first focused on discussing the situation, conducting class education, and exposing the cover of class struggle, deeply implanting the concept of class struggle, heightening the alertness to class struggle, and creating a strong atmosphere of struggle against the enemy. Our specific approach was: based on the education of the situation, we mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants to extensively discuss their family history, village history, and personal liberation history. Through reminiscing and comparing, and through recalling bitterness and tasting sweetness, we aroused the deep hatred of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants towards the old society, towards capitalism, and towards the Chinese Khrushchev; we deepened their boundless love for socialism and for Chairman Mao, making them more consciously loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants said: "Without Chairman Mao, we would not have been liberated; without the Communist Party, we would not have been liberated; without remembering past bitterness, we would not have peace; without remembering the enemy, we would not have peace."

In the study class, the poor peasant old mother Zhu Xiaomei from Jiangqiao Production Team recalled the past, compared it with the present, and looked towards the future. She dug out the roots of bitterness and found the sources of sweetness, feeling deeply moved. She repeatedly told the young people her own history of blood and tears, making them understand what class is, what exploitation is, and what revolution is. In Jiangqiao Production Team, there was a warehouse keeper who initially did not want to do this job and was unwilling to accept the warehouse key. Zhu Xiaomei said: "Before liberation, only landlords and rich peasants had warehouse keys. We poor and lower-middle peasants had nothing to eat, let alone warehouse keys. Chairman Mao led us to seize this key from the landlords and rich peasants and handed it over to us poor and lower-middle peasants. If we do not firmly grasp this key and manage the grain well, are we going to let the landlords and rich peasants take it back? Would that be worthy of Chairman Mao?" Zhu Xiaomei's words touched the keeper's heart, and he happily took the key, expressing his determination to manage the warehouse well for the poor and lower-middle peasants. Zhu Xiaomei deeply understood from her own experience that seizing power from the enemy requires Mao Zedong Thought; today, to firmly grasp power also requires Mao Zedong Thought. She studied Mao Zedong Thought with deep class feelings. Although she was old and had poor eyesight, she wore glasses and insisted on studying every day. Sometimes when she was sick, she still followed the broadcast to study Chairman Mao's quotations. Not only did she study Mao Zedong Thought herself, but she also organized twelve other poor peasants in their sixties and seventies to form a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team. They propagated Mao Zedong Thought day and night, regardless of weather, singing praises to our great leader Chairman Mao and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Through class education, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants opened their eyes, severely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of the extinction of class struggle, and further exposed the cover of the current class struggle. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Nanlin Production Team revealed a shocking fact in the study class: a lawless rich peasant in this team hid a box of accounts for a counter-revolutionary comeback, even publicly declaring that he would "never forget" four things: the seizure of land, the return of tools, the struggle by the masses, and supervised labor. The living class struggle facts made the poor and lower-middle peasants further realize that the Chinese Khrushchev, together with the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, wore the same pants, sang the same tune, and walked the same path. He was the representative of all class enemies within the country. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: "We must remember the bitter past, uproot the black roots, hold the red book, grasp the lifeline, and follow Chairman Mao's revolution for life."

Firmly Grasping the Struggle Between the Two Roads

Chairman Mao teaches us: "If socialism does not occupy the countryside, capitalism will inevitably occupy it." The struggle between socialism and capitalism is the focal point of class struggle in the countryside and the core issue of educating and transforming peasants. Study classes must grasp class struggle and firmly grasp the struggle between the two roads. They must use Mao Zedong Thought, this extremely powerful ideological weapon, to "continuously instill socialist ideology into the peasant masses and criticize capitalist tendencies." Using Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we must systematically and thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that the Chinese Khrushchev promoted in the countryside, and closely link it with the actual struggle between the two roads in this region and unit. Only in this way can we criticize effectively, deeply, and thoroughly, and quickly raise the masses' awareness of the struggle between the two lines.

In the countryside, during the three periods of year-end distribution, planning arrangement, and agricultural and sideline products going to market, capitalist forces often rise up, and the struggle between the two roads often becomes the most acute and prominent. Over the past year, our brigade has focused on these three key points, using Mao Zedong Thought study classes as a platform, and holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism, launching an attack on capitalism.

Controlling the "distribution gate." When the great "January Revolution" storm swept the country, the agent of the Chinese Khrushchev in Shanghai spread the counter-revolutionary economic wind, launching a ferocious counterattack against the revolutionary masses, attempting to sabotage the revolution, sabotage socialist construction, and sabotage the collective economy of the people's commune. The sharp and complex class struggle and the struggle between the two lines were also reflected in our brigade. At that time, we were in the process of year-end distribution. Some untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, in response to a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, spread rumors and stirred up trouble, saying: "The public accumulation is the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, and the grain and money should all be distributed." Whether or not to retain public accumulation is not just a matter of a few yuan, but a major issue of which road to take and whether to implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the study class, we brought this issue to learn Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, using Mao Zedong Thought to fight against the counter-revolutionary economic wind. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: "Increasing production and income, retaining more public accumulation, and strengthening the collective economy is not the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, but Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This road we will definitely take. We took it in the past, we take it now, and we will always take it in the future." After the poor and lower-middle peasants' democratic discussion, the brigade correctly handled the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, increasing the retained public accumulation fund and public welfare fund from 8.3% of the previous year to 10.02%. The entire brigade, in addition to selling surplus grain according to regulations, also sold an additional 12,000 jin, expressing the poor and lower-middle peasants' loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and their firm resolve to walk the socialist road.

Controlling the "planning gate." Last year, when implementing the sowing area plan, our brigade, in order to firmly implement Chairman Mao's great strategic decision of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people" and the policy of "grain as the key link," decided to plant more grain, cotton, and oil. However, some production teams mistakenly believed that the grain supply had passed, planning to cut down some grain sowing area to plant watermelons and muskmelons, increasing economic income. Some even attempted to secretly expand the cultivation of mushrooms. We seized this opportunity and repeatedly studied in the study class Chairman Mao's great teaching of "when we make plans, do things, and think problems, we must start from the fact that our country has 600 million people," severely criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of "money as the commander" and "material incentives." A team leader said: "I was fooled by the Chinese Khrushchev, only considering the interests of my own production team, forgetting the state's interests, forgetting socialism, and almost walking into the capitalist dead end, it was really dangerous!" Everyone's awareness was raised, the direction was clarified, and they firmly acted according to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, firmly obeying the state plan. The land originally planned to be changed to watermelons and muskmelons was all sown with grain; the team that planned to expand the cultivation of mushrooms also gave up this idea. In this way, the state's sowing area plan was fully implemented.

The third gate to control is the "market gate." Last year, when a large amount of green silkworm beans went to market, a production team sold them at a high price. This showed that the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's "three selfs and one package" revisionism had not been completely eliminated. We brought this issue to the production team and brigade study classes, organizing everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's great teachings of "only socialism can save China" and "without the socialization of agriculture, there will be no complete and solid socialism," and thoroughly criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's black words of promoting "three selfs and one package." The poor and lower-middle peasants said: "Although the figure of two cents is small, it reflects the struggle between the two roads and the two lines, which is a matter of principle." In the study class, the poor and lower-middle peasants of this production team also recalled and denounced the poisoning of the Chinese Khrushchev's "three selfs and one package" on themselves. They said: "In 1962, some members of our production team were poisoned by the Chinese Khrushchev, once enthusiastic about cultivating private plots, running free markets, and managing rice fields with piecework to the household, thus affecting the team's production. At that time, it was really the landlords and rich peasants clapping their hands and laughing, and the poor and lower-middle peasants jumping with both feet. Fortunately, Chairman Mao discovered this problem in time and stopped this evil wind." The facts deeply educated the team cadres, and they said: "No matter how strange it is, it is because of the 'selfishness' in the mind. 'Selfishness' plays tricks, and you can't recognize the direction and distinguish right from wrong." As soon as the study class ended, they went to the unit that bought the green silkworm beans to apologize and returned the extra money they sold. Since then, the entire brigade has never had a similar problem again. The facts strongly prove that conducting study classes is a good way to enhance the peasants' awareness of the struggle between the two roads and the two lines, resist capitalism, and insist on socialism.

Promoting Three Images

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must fight selfishness and criticize revisionism." In the process of firmly grasping the struggle between the two roads in the study class, the masses increasingly consciously demanded to break selfishness and establish public spirit. They said: "'Revisionism' is a tree, and 'selfishness' is the root. If you cut down the tree without uprooting the root, the branches will grow again." As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepened, the contradiction between "public" and "private" increasingly became an important content of the current struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. Only by firmly grasping the struggle to break selfishness and establish public spirit can we guide the peasants to insist on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and firmly walk the socialist road, uprooting the roots of revisionism.

Due to the existence of several thousand years of small peasant economy, the influence of private ownership in the peasants is very deep. Therefore, we must launch an offensive, annihilation, and prolonged battle against the "selfishness." Only by persistently and continuously fighting can we gradually eliminate the "selfishness." How to fight "selfishness"? Our brigade's method is to organize the masses to extensively study the "Three Articles," promote three images, extensively expose the harm of "selfishness," and extensively speak of the benefits of "public spirit." In this way, we make "selfishness" stink, and everyone hates it and fights it; we promote the three bright images representing "public spirit" high, and everyone loves it and learns from it. In the process of fighting selfishness, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants also created a method of "encountering one part of selfishness, using one quotation, and thinking of one image." That is: when fighting selfishness, think of Zhang Zedong and Chairman Mao's teaching of "completely" and "thoroughly" for the people; when fighting selfishness, think of Norman Bethune and Chairman Mao's teaching of "selflessly serving the people"; when fighting selfishness, think of the old fool and Chairman Mao's teaching of "making up your mind, not fearing sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." This method is visible, easy to remember, and effective.

In the study class, we carried out the struggle to break selfishness and establish public spirit, with the cadres taking the lead in fighting selfishness. The saying goes: "Villages look at villages, households look at households, and commune members look at cadres." Cadres are the leaders of the masses. Only by taking the lead in fighting selfishness can they better lead the masses to consciously fight selfishness. The brigade leader was criticized in the movement and once had a blocked mind, deciding not to be a cadre anymore. In the study class, he studied the "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao and a series of instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, thinking: Chairman Mao teaches me to "replace the 'fear' character with the 'dare' character, replace the 'I' character with the 'public' character, and replace 'believing in oneself' with 'believing in the masses.'" But I? I am "fear" first, "selfishness" first, and do not believe in the masses. Isn't this directly against Chairman Mao's teachings? Isn't this deviating from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line? He took out the "Three Articles" again, comparing them with the three bright images, and the more he compared, the more he felt that his selfish thoughts were too many, and he was not like a communist. The next day after breakfast, he actively went to various production teams to inspect production. However, on the way, he thought of his recent criticism and wondered who would listen to him if he went to inspect production and speak. As soon as selfishness arose, his feet became heavy, and he could not walk. He sat on the road, took out the "Three Articles" again, compared them with Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of "selflessly serving the people," and felt that the gap was too big. He made up his mind to actively complete the task of inspecting production. Later, the brigade cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants had heart-to-heart talks with him, helping him further correct his attitude towards the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He realized that he had indeed had many shortcomings and errors in his years as a cadre. The masses' criticism was completely justified. If the shortcomings and errors were not criticized and fought against, they would develop and go astray. He decided to follow Chairman Mao's words, stand up straight, stand up for the revolution, and manage the power well for the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

The commune members consciously fought selfishness, focusing on solving the problem of farming for the revolution. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The serious problem is educating the peasants." Our brigade, through continuous fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, actively learning and applying the "Three Articles," and remembering the three images, is gradually cultivating a new type of peasant. Some commune members were once poisoned by the Chinese Khrushchev's "work points as the commander" and "material incentives," believing that "labor for work points and farming for the family," and "work points in hand, money and grain all have." Therefore, in labor, they often appeared to compete for work points, seek quantity, and ignore quality. The study class seized this problem, severely criticized the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's "work points as the commander" and "material incentives," thoroughly broke the idea of "farming for work points," and established the idea of "farming for the revolution." Everyone realized that what attitude and purpose to take towards farming is a major issue of which road to take. A female commune member, who used to be late for work and early to leave, and compete for big work points, participated in the study class and realized that "work points as the commander" was a poisonous soft knife that did not see blood, used by the Chinese Khrushchev to poison the poor and lower-middle peasants. She exposed her selfish thoughts in the study class, checked herself for having too many selfish thoughts, shallow vision, small mind, and being stuck in a personal small circle. She decided to firmly study and apply the "Three Articles," throw "selfishness" out of the clouds, and hold "public spirit" in her heart, following Chairman Mao and always moving forward. She said what she did, and now she is eager to work, late to leave, and very active in learning and attending meetings. Her family was rated as a model family for home study.

"The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." The revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants of our brigade deeply felt that in the study class, promoting three images, firmly grasping the struggle to break selfishness and establish public spirit, using Mao Zedong Thought to transform people's souls, and achieving ideological revolutionization, this is indeed an effective way to promote the transformation of our peasants' worldview.

Our great leader Chairman Mao, in his latest instructions, teaches us: "Conducting study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in the study classes." We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, have studied this latest instruction and are all excited. We are determined to seriously learn from the PLA, learn from Dazhai, and learn from Hongqing, always be loyal to Chairman Mao, always be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and always be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We will further conduct various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, launch a new high tide of "grasp revolution and promote production," strive for a bumper harvest throughout the year, and achieve new victories in the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will strive to make our brigade a red Mao Zedong Thought school!

　　办好毛泽东思想学习班　提高两条路线斗争的觉悟
　　上海县北桥公社灯塔大队　陆顺龙
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，我们大队在一九六六年十二月初，办起了毛泽东思想学习班（当时称“老三篇”训练班），以后发展到生产队办。从去年十一月开始，社员家庭里也办起了学习班。一年多来，我们始终把大办毛泽东思想学习班放在一切工作的首位。农闲办，农忙也办，大忙坚持办，从未间断。通过大办学习班，广大贫下中农对我们伟大领袖毛主席、对伟大的毛泽东思想更加热爱。广大贫下中农头脑里有了毛泽东思想，心胸开阔眼睛亮，更加热爱集体，热爱社会主义。他们大破“近望灶前头，远望水桥头”的旧观念，大立“站在家门口，眼望天安门，心向全世界”的新思想；他们丢掉“为工分劳动，为发家种田”的旧思想，形成“为集体劳动，为革命种田”的新风尚。贫下中农把破私立公的斗争，逐渐提高到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的新高度。
    “代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”一九六七年，我们大队遭到了党内一小撮走资派的破坏，又遇到了旱灾。但是，广大贫下中农和革命干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，与天斗，与地斗，与阶级敌人斗，终于战胜困难，夺得了前所未有的大丰收。
    我们办毛泽东思想学习班的经验，概括起来是三句话：增强一个观念，狠抓两条道路的斗争，大树三个形象。
    增强一个观念
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。”阶级斗争，无产阶级专政，是毛泽东思想的核心和灵魂。有没有阶级斗争观念，是衡量对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线忠不忠的重要标志，是加强还是削弱无产阶级专政的重要标志。只有念念不忘阶级斗争，脑子里有了敌情，眼睛里有了敌人，才能牢牢掌握好印把子，保证无产阶级的铁打江山永不变色。
    遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，我们大队办的学习班，首先从谈形势入手，进行回忆对比，大搞阶级教育，大揭阶级斗争盖子，把阶级斗争观念扎得深深的，把阶级斗争的警惕性提得高高的，把对敌斗争的空气搞得浓浓的。我们的具体做法是：在形势教育的基础上，发动贫下中农大讲家史、村史、个人翻身史。经过回忆对比、忆苦思甜，激起广大贫下中农对旧社会、对资本主义、对中国赫鲁晓夫的深刻仇恨；加深了对社会主义、对毛主席的无比热爱，更加自觉地忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。广大贫下中农说：“翻身不忘毛主席，解放不忘共产党，幸福不忘过去苦，和平不忘有敌人。”
    姜桥生产队贫农老妈妈朱小妹，在学习班上忆过去，比现在，望将来，挖出了苦根，找到了甜源，心里十分激动。她一次又一次地把自己的一部血泪史讲给青年们听，使他们懂得什么是阶级，什么是剥削，什么是革命。姜桥生产队有个仓库保管员，开始不愿意做这项工作，不肯接受仓库钥匙。朱小妹说：“解放前只有地主、富农有仓库钥匙，我们贫下中农吃了上顿没下顿，那来什么仓库钥匙？毛主席领导我们从地主、富农手里夺回来这把钥匙，交给我们贫下中农。我们贫下中农不捏牢这把钥匙，不掌好粮食保管的大权，难道叫地主、富农来掌吗？这对得起毛主席吗？”朱小妹的话打动了保管员的心，他愉快地拿起钥匙，表示一定要为贫下中农管好仓库。朱小妹从自己的切身经历中深深懂得，从敌人手中夺权，要靠毛泽东思想；今天要掌好权，也要靠毛泽东思想。她怀着深厚的阶级感情活学活用毛主席著作。她年老眼花，看不清字，戴上老花眼镜，坚持天天学。有时她病了，还跟着广播喇叭学习毛主席语录。她不仅自己学习毛泽东思想，还发动了十二个六、七十岁的老贫农，组成毛泽东思想宣传队，不分昼夜，不避寒暑，风雨无阻，到处宣传毛泽东思想，歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，歌颂毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    通过阶级教育，广大贫下中农眼睛亮了，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，进一步揭开了当前阶级斗争盖子。南林生产队的贫下中农在学习班里揭发了一个触目惊心的事实：这个队有个不法富农藏了一箱变天账，妄想反攻倒算，甚至公开叫嚣要“四个不忘记”：土地征收不忘记，农具归公不忘记，被群众斗争不忘记，监督劳动不忘记。活生生的阶级斗争事实，使贫下中农进一步认识到：中国赫鲁晓夫同地富反坏分子穿一条裤子，唱一个调子，走一条路子，他是国内一切阶级敌人的总代表。贫下中农说：“我们要牢记苦底子，挖掉黑根子，拿起红本子，掌握命根子，紧跟毛主席革命一辈子。”
    狠抓两条道路的斗争
    毛主席教导我们：“对于农村的阵地，社会主义如果不去占领，资本主义就必然会去占领。”社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，是农村中阶级斗争的焦点，也是教育农民、改造农民的核心问题。学习班要抓阶级斗争，就要狠抓两条道路斗争，就要用毛泽东思想这个无比强大的思想武器，“向农民群众不断地灌输社会主义思想，批评资本主义倾向。”用毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，系统地、彻底地批判中国赫鲁晓夫在农村中推行的反革命修正主义路线，并且和本地区、本单位两条道路斗争的实际紧密结合起来。只有这样，才能批得活，批得深，批得透，才能迅速提高群众对两条路线斗争的自觉性。
    在农村中，年终分配、计划安排、农副产品上市这三个时候，资本主义势力往往最容易抬头，两条道路斗争也往往最尖锐、最突出。一年多来，我们大队就是把住了这三个重要关口，以毛泽东思想学习班为阵地，高举革命大批判的旗帜，向资本主义发动进攻。
    把好“分配关”。当伟大的“一月革命”风暴席卷全国时，中国赫鲁晓夫在上海的代理人刮起反革命经济主义妖风，向无产阶级革命派发动猖狂反扑，妄图破坏革命，破坏社会主义建设，破坏人民公社集体经济。尖锐复杂的阶级斗争、两条路线的斗争，也反映到我们大队。当时我们正在搞年终分配，一些没有改造好的地富反坏右分子同党内一小撮走资派相呼应，煽阴风，点鬼火，胡说什么：“提留公共积累是资产阶级反动路线，粮钱应该全部分光。”要不要提留公共积累，这不是几个钱的问题，而是关系到走什么道路，是不是执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的大问题。在学习班上，我们带着这个问题学习毛主席的有关指示，用毛泽东思想同反革命经济主义妖风进行了针锋相对的斗争。贫下中农说：“增产增收，多留些公共积累，壮大集体经济，不是什么资产阶级反动路线，而是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。这条路我们走定了。过去走，现在走，永远要走下去。”经过贫下中农民主讨论，大队正确处理了国家、集体、个人三者关系，把提留的公积金和公益金，由前一年的百分之八点三增加到百分之十点零二。全大队除按规定出售超产粮外，各生产队还多交售了一万二千多斤，表达了贫下中农忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚定地走社会主义道路的一颗红心。
    把好“计划关”。去年在落实播种计划面积时，我们大队为了坚决贯彻毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略决策和“以粮为纲”的方针，决定多种粮、棉、油。但是，有的生产队却错误地认为吃粮已过关，准备砍掉一些粮食播种面积，改种西瓜、甜瓜，增加经济收入。有的企图私自扩种蘑菇。我们抓住这个苗子，在学习班上反复学习毛主席关于“我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发”的伟大教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“钞票挂帅”、“物质刺激”的反革命修正主义黑货。有个生产队队长说：“我上了中国赫鲁晓夫的当，只考虑自己一个生产队的利益，把国家利益放在脑后，忘记了社会主义，差点走进资本主义死弄堂，真是危险啊！”大家觉悟提高了，方向认清了，坚决按毛主席的无产阶级革命路线办事，坚决服从国家计划。原来准备改种西瓜、甜瓜的地，全部种上了粮食；原来想扩种蘑菇的队，也取消了这个打算。这样，就保证了国家播种计划面积的全面落实。
    把好的第三关是“上市关”。去年青蚕豆大量上市的时候，有个生产队高价出售青蚕豆。这说明中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”修正主义的流毒还没有肃清。我们就把这个问题提到生产队和大队的学习班上，组织大家反复学习毛主席“只有社会主义能够救中国”，“没有农业社会化，就没有全部的巩固的社会主义”的伟大教导，对中国赫鲁晓夫推行“三自一包”的黑话，进行了彻底批判。贫下中农说：“两分钱的数字虽小，但反映了两条道路、两条路线的斗争，是大是大非的问题。”在学习班上，这个生产队的贫下中农还回忆和控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“三自一包”对自己的毒害。他们说：“一九六二年，我们生产队的少数社员，中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒，一度热衷于种自留地，跑自由市场，水稻管理包工到户，因而影响了队里的生产。那时候，真是地主富农拍手笑，贫下中农双脚跳。幸亏毛主席他老人家及时发现这个问题，制止了这股歪风。”事实深深地教育了队干部，他们说：“千怪万怪，要怪头脑里的‘私’字。‘私’字作怪，就认不清方向，辨不明是非。”学习班一结束，他们就到那个买青蚕豆的单位赔礼道歉，并把多卖的钱如数退还。从此整个大队再也没有出现过类似的问题。事实有力地证明：办学习班，是提高农民两条道路、两条路线斗争的觉悟，抵制资本主义、坚持社会主义的一个好办法。
    大树三个形象
    毛主席教导我们：“要斗私，批修”。在学习班狠抓两条道路斗争过程中，群众越来越自觉地要求破私立公。他们说：“‘修’字是棵树，‘私’字是总根，砍树不挖根，树枝又重生。”随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，“公”和“私”的矛盾越来越成为当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的一个重要内容。只有狠抓破私立公的斗争，才能引导农民坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚定不移地走社会主义道路，铲除修正主义的根子。
    由于几千年小农经济的存在，私有观念在农民中的影响是很深的。因此，对“私”字要打进攻战、歼灭战、持久战。只有这样顽强地打，不断地打，才能把“私”字一点一点地打掉。怎样斗“私”？我们大队的方法是组织群众大学“老三篇”，大树三个形象，大摆“私”字的危害，大讲“公”字的好处。这样，把
  “私”字搞得臭臭的，人人见了恨，人人见了斗；把代表“公”字的三个光辉形象树得高高的，人人见了爱，人人见了学。广大贫下中农在斗私的过程中，还创造出了“遇到一分私心，用上一条语录，联想一个形象”的方法。这就是：斗私，要想到张思德，想到毛主席的教导“完全”、“彻底”为人民；斗私，要想到白求恩，想到毛主席的教导“毫不利己专门利人”；斗私，要想到老愚公，想到毛主席的教导“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”这种方法，看得见，容易记，效果好。
    我们在学习班开展破私立公的斗争，干部带头斗私。重点是解决为革命掌权的问题。俗话讲：“村看村，户看户，社员看干部。”干部是群众的带头人，只有带头斗私，才能更好地带动群众自觉斗私。大队队长在运动中受到批评，一度思想不通，打定主意今后不当干部了。在学习班里，他学习了毛主席亲自主持制定的《十六条》和有关无产阶级文化大革命的一系列指示，他想：毛主席教导我要“把‘怕’字换成‘敢’字，把‘我’字换成‘公’字，把‘相信自己’换成‘相信群众’”。而我呢？却是“怕”字当头，“私”字领先，不相信群众，这不是直接违背了毛主席的教导吗？这不是离开了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线吗？他又拿起“老三篇”，对照了三个光辉形象，越对照越觉得自己私心杂念太多，那象一个共产党员？第二天吃过早饭，他就主动到各生产队去检查生产。可是，走在路上，又想到自己刚刚受过批评，去检查生产，讲话啥人听？私心一上升，脚就重了，路也走不动了。他坐在路上，再一次拿出“老三篇”，对照白求恩同志“毫不利己专门利人”的精神，觉得自己的差距太大了。他下定决心，积极地完成了检查生产的任务。以后，大队干部和贫下中农和他谈心，使他进一步端正了对待无产阶级文化大革命的态度。他认识到：自己当干部十几年，确实存在着不少缺点和错误。群众的批评是完全应该的。对缺点和错误不批不斗，发展下去，就要走到斜路上去。他决心听毛主席的话，挺起腰杆子，站起来革命，为广大贫下中农掌好权。
    社员自觉斗私，重点是解决为革命种田的问题。毛主席教导我们：“严重的问题是教育农民”。我们大队通过不断斗私批修，活学活用“老三篇”，牢记三个形象，一代新型农民正在逐步成长。有些社员过去中了中国赫鲁晓夫“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”的流毒，认为“劳动为工分，种田为养家”，“工分到了手，钱粮样样有”。所以在劳动中常常出现争工分，求数量，不顾质量的现象。学习班抓住这个问题，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”的流毒，大破“为工分种田”的思想，大立“为革命种田”的思想。大家认识到：对种田采取什么态度，抱什么目的，是走什么道路的大问题。有个女社员，过去出工在后头，收工在前头，工分争大头。参加学习班学习后，她认识到：“工分挂帅”是中国赫鲁晓夫毒害贫下中农的一把杀人不见血的软刀子。她在学习班上，把自己的私心杂念亮了出来，检查自己过去私心重，目光浅，气量小，兜在个人小圈子里拔不出来。她决心狠学狠用“老三篇”，把“私”字抛出云外头，把“公”字抱在心里头，紧跟毛主席，永远朝前走。她说到做到，现在出工抢在前，收工落在后，学习、开会都很积极，她家被评为家庭学习标兵。
      “世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。我们大队的革命干部和贫下中农深深体会到：在学习班里，大树三个形象，狠抓破私立公，用毛泽东思想改造人的灵魂，实现思想革命化，这正是促进我们农民转变世界观的有效途径。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在最新指示中教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”我们广大贫下中农，学习了这条最新指示，人人欢欣鼓舞。我们决心认真向解放军学习，向大寨学习，向洪泾学习，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，进一步办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示，掀起“抓革命，促生产”的新高潮，力争全年农业丰收，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利中立新功，为进一步把我们大队办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校而奋斗！
