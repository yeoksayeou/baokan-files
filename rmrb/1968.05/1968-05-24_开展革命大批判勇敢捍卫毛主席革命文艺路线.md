Two years ago, our "Jie Shengwen" Criticism Group, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and the great inspiration of the May 16th Circular personally directed by Chairman Mao, took up our pens and joined the battlefield of revolutionary criticism. Together with the broad masses of revolutionary workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the revolutionary Red Guards, we launched a "revolutionary, combative, and mass-based literary criticism" and opened fire on the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line! We opened fire on the anti-communist, anti-people "academic authorities" of the bourgeoisie! We opened fire on the literary ancestors of Soviet revisionism like Sholokhov! We opened fire on the handful of top capitalist-roaders within the Party, such as China's Khrushchev! Reviewing our battle journey under Chairman Mao's great call to "criticize the bourgeoisie," we deeply feel that the epoch-making document—the Circular—points out the direction for continuing the revolution under socialist conditions, points out the direction for consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, and is a great development of Marxism-Leninism on the theory of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship.

Not understanding proletarian politics means not understanding literary criticism.

In the past, we had a question we couldn't understand. We lived in the regiment, read Chairman Mao's books, listened to Chairman Mao's words, and walked the path of emphasizing proletarian politics. The political atmosphere was thick. But once we entered those cultural palaces or movie theaters, we saw that the stage and screen were dominated by foreigners, dead people, and ancient figures, and we couldn't see the towering figures of our workers, peasants, and soldiers. We felt suffocated. Following the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin, we took up our pens, wrote our own scripts, and performed ourselves, "propagating Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in an image-based and popular way." But some "authorities" and "celebrities" said: "This is 'simplification,' 'vulgarization,' 'plain water.'"

Once, we showed a song we created and that was very popular among our comrades in the regiment to an "artistic director." But this guy, before he even finished reading it, shook his head and said, "It's tuneless, Arabic letters with symbols, it can't even be called music!" Hearing this, we were so angry we nearly burst. We've been liberated for over a decade, and we workers and peasants have long since stood up as masters of the state, so why can't we stand up on the literary stage? The Kuomintang reactionaries have long been defeated by us, so why are they still so arrogant on the literary stage? The country is everywhere building socialism, so why doesn't the literary stage reflect socialist revolution and socialist construction, but is filled with the rubbish of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism? During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we brought these questions we couldn't understand to study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the Circular, and the "Minutes of the Conference on Army Literary and Art Work Convened by Comrade Jiang Qing on Behalf of Comrade Lin Biao." Only then did we understand: it turns out that the literary stage also has the issue of who dominates whom politically. Since the founding of the nation, the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique led by Zhou Yang has controlled the power in the literary world. They do not allow workers, peasants, and soldiers to step onto the literary stage, do not allow them to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, but "they let all the ghosts and monsters out," dominating our politics for seventeen years! In a socialist country under proletarian dictatorship, can we tolerate this counter-revolutionary, anti-socialist literary black line continuing to dominate our politics? No, absolutely not! With deep hatred for the counter-revolutionary revisionists, we took up our pens and launched an attack on the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line!

The counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary world, relying on a few drops of black ink in their bellies, put on a stinky noble air, and with a set of colorful so-called "literary theories," tried to scare us. We don't buy it at all! Everyone said: we are not here to be "scholars," we are here to make a revolution! To overthrow the bourgeoisie, to dominate the bourgeoisie politically. Chairman Mao teaches us that literary criticism "always places political standards first and artistic standards second." We wielded the thousand-pound hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and struck hard at the ancestor of the literary black line, Zhou Yang, exposing and criticizing Zhou Yang's clique using the literary stage to engage in anti-Party activities and their evil plot to restore capitalism. Their "broad subject matter" theory is the theory of poisonous weeds spreading, their "write what is real" theory is the theory of attacking socialism, ... their "national defense literature" of the 1930s, their "literature for all the people" of the 1960s, are all Kuomintang literature in disguise! They are genuine counter-revolutionary revisionist literature!

In the battle, we clearly saw: every dark play on the literary stage hides the political conspiracies of counter-revolutionary plotters on the political stage. This shows that the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature is tightly intertwined with a bourgeois reactionary line in politics, and the struggle between the two lines in literature is a reflection of the struggle between the two lines in politics. Behind those who monopolize the literary stage and cultural realm, implementing bourgeois dictatorship over us, stand the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, stand the great bureaucrats who have stolen the name of the Communist Party. Chairman Mao said: the overthrown bourgeoisie uses various methods to try to use the literary stage as a breeding ground to corrupt the masses and prepare for the restoration of capitalism. The counter-revolutionary revisionists who have usurped the leadership of the cultural realm and their black backers are doing just that. They wield their pens, eyeing our guns, trying to seize our power. Over the past few decades, the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary people under its leadership have fought a long struggle with the Kuomintang reactionaries, confiscating their guns and seizing their power, establishing proletarian rule. After national liberation, we carried out a series of socialist transformations. But we have not yet had the chance to confiscate the pens of the Kuomintang reactionaries' agents. The pen is part of the superstructure, and if the superstructure cannot protect the economic base, it will destroy the economic base. If we allow the bourgeoisie to dominate us in the cultural realm, once the time is ripe, they will try to overthrow proletarian dictatorship in the political and economic realms, and all our decades of revolutionary struggle will be in vain! Therefore, literary criticism is essentially political criticism. If one does not understand proletarian politics, does not understand class struggle under socialist conditions, does not understand the struggle between the two lines within the Party, does not understand that the revolution must continue under the dictatorship of the proletariat, one cannot thoroughly criticize the bourgeoisie in the literary realm.

With our understanding deepened, we not only treat every literary criticism article as a cannon shell to attack the bourgeoisie command, but also develop the battle from the literary stage to the political stage, fiercely criticizing the black backers of the literary black line, fiercely criticizing the handful of top capitalist-roaders within the Party. In this process, we read Tao Zhu's book "Ideal" and found it full of problems, filled with black words. We identified this book as a big poisonous weed. Everyone said we should criticize it! But criticizing such a "big figure" is no small matter. Should we criticize him or not? We studied the Circular again and again. Chairman Mao said in the Circular: "For example, characters like Khrushchev are now sleeping by our side." Chairman Mao also taught us: "'Dare to be skinned alive, dare to pull the emperor off his horse,' we must have this fearless spirit when fighting for socialism and communism." We identified Tao Zhu as a Khrushchev-like figure sleeping by the side of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. The bigger his "official" position, the greater the harm he does to the revolution, and the more his command must be overthrown! To defend Chairman Mao, to defend the proletarian headquarters, we made up our minds to criticize his "Ideal," and we immediately started writing criticism materials, launching a fierce attack on this counter-revolutionary two-faced character!

Under Chairman Mao's brilliant command, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses exposed China's Khrushchev, who is the mastermind behind the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line, who is the agent of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the bourgeoisie, and all exploiting classes within our Party. We immediately joined the battle to criticize China's Khrushchev, determined to criticize him deeply and thoroughly, to criticize him down and stink him up!

We deeply feel that the struggle of hundreds of millions of revolutionary workers, peasants, and soldiers in our country against the literary black line is a life-and-death class struggle. Chairman Mao said: "The struggle between socialism and capitalism in our country in the ideological realm, as to who will win and who will lose, will take a fairly long time to resolve." We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and carry the struggle on the political and ideological fronts to the end.

Using Mao Zedong Thought to fight, making proletarian thought further dominate.

We take Comrade Jiang Qing as our example, learning from her consistent adherence to and defense of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and the arts, using Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, and together with hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers, fiercely criticizing Zhou Yang and his black backer, China's Khrushchev. In the battle, we deeply feel: criticism is using Mao Zedong Thought to fight, making proletarian thought further dominate.

The "Minutes" gave us a combat mission: "In literature, the struggle against foreign revisionism cannot be limited to catching small figures like Chukhrai. We must catch the big ones, catch Sholokhov, dare to confront him. He is the ancestor of revisionist literature." We resolutely responded to this combat call and opened fire on Sholokhov!

Hearing that we were going to confront Sholokhov, some people were surprised: Sholokhov is a world-famous "great writer," his works are all "big volumes," can a few of you soldiers dare to confront him? We said, he is a bourgeois, and we are going to dominate him politically, why not dare to confront him! Chairman Mao taught us: "Big is not scary. Isn't American imperialism very big? We confronted him and it wasn't so bad. So, some big things in the world are actually not scary." Sholokhov's counter-revolutionary old work "And Quiet Flows the Don," four thick volumes, one hundred and fifty thousand words, long and stinky. Both domestically and internationally, people praise it as a "literary bible," as if it's so "big" that it can't be touched. But the bigger it is, the more we feel it's very "small," because it's bourgeois goods, politically reactionary, and artistically decadent. We decided to cut down this big poisonous weed! To confront Sholokhov! We strategically despise it but tactically take it seriously. This book is about the events before and after the October Revolution, so we first spent most of our time seriously studying Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao's discussions on the October Revolution and proletarian dictatorship, and then, with strong class hatred, we finished reading "And Quiet Flows the Don." We used Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon and fought continuously for a month, exposing the reactionary essence of "And Quiet Flows the Don" in its crazy opposition to the October Revolution, its attacks on the Soviet government and proletarian dictatorship, and its advocacy of counter-revolutionary restoration. Immediately after that, we pressed our advantage and criticized his "Virgin Soil Upturned," "A Man's Fate," and the modern revisionist war literature specimen—Simonov's "Days and Nights," "The Living and the Dead."

These several criticism articles greatly boosted the morale of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some comrades wrote to praise us for fighting well, but domestic and foreign class enemies cursed us for "not understanding art," "not understanding history," "taking a frivolous attitude towards world-classics," and so on. We responded to them with a sharp criticism.

Chairman Mao taught us: "The proletariat's struggle against the bourgeoisie, the proletariat's dictatorship over the bourgeoisie, the proletariat's dictatorship in the superstructure, including in various cultural realms, the proletariat's continued elimination of the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the Communist Party and are waving the red flag to oppose the red flag, etc., on these fundamental issues, can we allow any equality?" For hundreds of years, thousands of years, the exploiting classes have oppressed the laboring people, never speaking of any justice or equality, never allowing the spread of proletarian thought. Today, we have every right and necessity to implement proletarian thought domination, to implement proletarian dictatorship in the ideological realm, not allowing the spread of bourgeois thought.

The process of the proletariat overthrowing the bourgeoisie's rule in the cultural realm is the process of using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly smash bourgeois thought. When we criticized some poisonous weed works, we saw a lot of so-called "literary theories" proposed by bourgeois "literary critics," such as the "imagery thinking" theory, the "deepening of realism" theory, the "middle character" theory, and so on. We are not afraid of these strange "theories," we will not fall into their "eight-diagram" trap. We firmly believe that Mao Zedong Thought can definitely overcome all the fallacies of the bourgeoisie. We rely on Chairman Mao's "Talks," rely on Chairman Mao's theory of class and class struggle, to mercilessly expose and criticize each big poisonous weed. Through criticism, we have seen more clearly the essence of those so-called "literary theories." Those so-called "literary theories" are all fallacies that defame workers, peasants, and soldiers, curse socialism, and attack Mao Zedong Thought!

Vice Chairman Lin said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the concentrated expression of proletarian thought, it is fundamentally opposed to the thought of private ownership and the exploiting classes. ... If we do not use Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought to fight, bourgeois thought will occupy the position, cause degeneration, and create chaos." In carrying out revolutionary criticism, we deeply feel: whether to use Mao Zedong Thought to occupy all positions or let bourgeois thought occupy the positions, this is related to establishing the domination of which class's thought, related to whether our power will change color, this is a life-and-death class struggle, and we must not talk about any "equality." Use Mao Zedong Thought to fight, thoroughly criticize the old world, and create a new world of Mao Zedong Thought, this is the glorious combat mission entrusted to us by history.

The cultural realm must also implement the proletarian dictatorship of the masses.

Proletarian dictatorship is the dictatorship of the masses. We feel that the proletariat's dictatorship in the cultural realm must also implement the dictatorship of the masses. In the past, when we seized power, we fought with the armed Kuomintang, mobilizing hundreds of millions of people to fight a people's war; today, when we consolidate power, we fight with the unarmed Kuomintang reactionaries, also mobilizing hundreds of millions of people to fight a "people's war." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao is a "people's war" to carry out revolutionary criticism of bourgeois and all exploiting classes' thought. Carrying out revolutionary, combative, and mass-based literary criticism is an important part of this "people's war." Seven hundred million people all become critics, and we can fundamentally eliminate all the ideological forms of the exploiting classes, and we can also establish a powerful proletarian dictatorship in the ideological realm.

We follow Chairman Mao's teachings and plant our roots among the masses. We work with our comrades in the regiment to open up the battlefield of revolutionary criticism, and together with the revolutionary comrades in the local area, we fiercely open fire on the bourgeoisie! Last year, on the 25th anniversary of the publication of the "Talks," we went to learn from a small propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought working on the front lines of "Supporting the Army, Supporting the Production, and Supporting the Left" and learned with our comrades, studying the "Talks," raising the red flag, cutting the black line, criticizing poisonous weeds, and denouncing the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line and its mastermind, China's Khrushchev. Our comrades all listed their experiences of using literary weapons to propagate Mao Zedong Thought on the front lines of "Supporting the Army, Supporting the Production, and Supporting the Left," supporting the proletarian revolutionaries with Mao Zedong Thought, which educated us greatly. We worked through the night, writing our comrades' speeches into articles such as "The Stage of Literature and the Stage of Politics," "Street Art and Stage Art," "A Class Struggle on the Stage," "Revolution on the Stage and Revolution in the Soul," "Criticize and Smash 'Cultivation,' Cut the Black Line," and "The Red Stage Forever Praises the Red Sun," and together with our comrades, we fought a battle to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian line in literature and the arts. We deeply feel: "The masses are the true heroes." The broad revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the most authoritative critics. In the battle, we learn from the masses in everything, consult the masses in everything, and never forget to plant our roots among the masses. Our slogan is: born in the soil, grown in the soil, "one leg in the mud," great! We go to the front lines of "Supporting the Army, Supporting the Production, and Supporting the Left," and together with the Red Guard revolutionary youngsters and our comrades in the regiment, we verbally and in writing attack the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party led by China's Khrushchev. We often learn from the special columns of criticism organized by our comrades, learning their clear class stance of loving and hating, learning their high class struggle consciousness and line struggle awareness of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, absorbing revolutionary nutrients from the masses, using the masses' thoughts, the masses' feelings, and the masses' language to criticize the bourgeoisie. Over the past two years, under the guidance of the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, inspired by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and in newspapers and magazines, we have published nearly a hundred articles criticizing the bourgeoisie. We will strive to be the vanguard soldiers in criticizing the bourgeoisie!

The old thoughts of the bourgeoisie and the exploiting classes have ruled and poisoned the people for hundreds of years, thousands of years, and are deeply rooted. We deeply feel that relying only on criticism in newspapers and magazines is not enough to uproot them. Therefore, in addition to writing criticism articles, we actively participate in the revolutionary criticism in society, propagandizing the significance of revolutionary criticism to the masses, exchanging experiences in criticizing the bourgeoisie with proletarian revolutionary comrades and Red Guard youngsters, and sometimes directly participating in the struggle to criticize the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. We feel that to thoroughly criticize the old world of the bourgeoisie, to clean up the mud left by the old society, we must mobilize everyone, from children of a few years old to elderly people with white hair. We deeply feel that if seven hundred million people all become critics, everyone actively attacks the bourgeoisie, we can criticize the bourgeoisie and all the thoughts of the exploiting classes deeply and thoroughly, criticize them down and stink them up, so that poisonous weeds cannot grow and spread freely.

Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," inspired by the Circular, and guided by Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses have completely broken with the old traditional concepts and thoroughly broken with all the old thoughts, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes, "never before have we seen the people so spirited, so full of fighting spirit, so full of vigor." We must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, be vigilant against arrogance and impetuosity, advance victoriously, carry the struggle between the two lines on the literary front to the end, criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line and its black backer, China's Khrushchev, deeply and thoroughly, criticize them down and stink them up, dig out all the unrepentant capitalist-roaders, traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the revolutionary literary and art troops, carry the political revolution under socialist conditions to the end, forever preserve the redness of the proletarian regime, and let it shine red for ten thousand generations!

    开展革命大批判勇敢捍卫毛主席革命文艺路线
    6410部队“解胜文”大批判战斗小组
    两年前，我们“解胜文”批判小组，在毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的光辉照耀下，在毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》的伟大鼓舞下，拿起笔杆子，杀上了革命大批判战场，和广大工农兵革命群众、红卫兵革命小将共同战斗，开展“革命的战斗的群众性的文艺批评”，向反革命修正主义文艺黑线猛烈开火！向反共反人民的资产阶级“学术权威”猛烈开火！向苏修文艺鼻祖肖洛霍夫之流猛烈开火！向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派猛烈开火！回顾我们在毛主席的“要批判资产阶级”的伟大战斗号令下前进的战斗历程，我们深深感到，划时代的文献——《通知》，指明了在社会主义条件下继续革命的方向，指明了巩固和加强无产阶级专政的方向，是马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政学说的伟大发展。
    不懂得无产阶级政治，就不懂得文艺批评
    过去，我们有个问题想不通。我们生活在连队，读的是毛主席的书，听的是毛主席的话，走的是突出无产阶级政治的路，政治空气浓浓的。可是，一走进那些文化宫、电影院，看到舞台上、银幕上，尽是洋人、死人、古人占统治地位，看不到我们工农兵的高大形象，心里憋得透不过气来。我们就按照林副主席的指示，拿起笔杆子，自己编节目，自己当演员，“形象地、通俗地宣传马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想”。可是，一些“权威”“名流”看了却说：这是“简单化”、“庸俗化”、“白开水”。有一次，我们把自己创作的一首很受连队战友欢迎的歌曲给一位“艺术指导”看。谁知这家伙还没看完，就晃着脑袋说：“没腔没调，阿拉伯字加符号，根本不能叫音乐！”听了这话，我们肺都快气炸了。解放都十几年了，我们工农兵早就翻身当了国家的主人，为什么在文艺舞台上翻不了身？国民党反动派早就被我们打垮了，为什么在文艺舞台上他们还那么神气活现？祖国到处都在建设社会主义，为什么文艺舞台上偏没有反映社会主义革命和社会主义建设的东西，却塞满了封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的破烂货？在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们带着这些想不通的问题，学习了毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，学习了《通知》，学习了《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》，才明白了：原来，文艺舞台上也存在着谁专谁的政的问题。建国以来，周扬一伙反革命修正主义分子，把持了文艺界的大权。他们不给工农兵登上文艺舞台的权利，不给工农兵宣传毛泽东思想的权利，“他们对于一切牛鬼蛇神却放手让其出笼”，专了我们十七年的政！在无产阶级专政的社会主义国家里，难道能够容忍这条反党反社会主义的文艺黑线继续专我们的政吗？不能，绝对不能！我们怀着对反革命修正主义分子的刻骨仇恨，挥笔向反革命修正主义文艺黑线杀去！
    文艺界的反革命修正主义分子，凭着肚子里有几滴黑墨水，摆出一副精神贵族的臭架子，拿出一套五花八门的所谓“文艺理论”，妄想把我们吓住，我们根本不吃这一套！大家说：我们不是来当“秀才”的，我们是来革命的！革资产阶级的命，专资产阶级的政。毛主席教导我们，文艺批评“总是以政治标准放在第一位，以艺术标准放在第二位的。”我们奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，狠狠地向文艺黑线的祖师爷周扬打去，揭露批判了周扬之流利用文艺阵地进行反党活动，复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，他们的“题材广泛”论就是毒草泛滥论，“写真实”论就是攻击社会主义论，……他们的三十年代“国防文学”，六十年代“全民文艺”，都是改头换面的国民党文艺！是地地道道的反革命修正主义文艺！
    在战斗中，我们清楚地看到：文艺舞台上的每一场黑戏，都包藏着政治舞台上反革命野心家的政治阴谋。这说明文艺上的反革命修正主义黑线是和一条政治上的资产阶级反动路线紧密扭在一起的，文艺上的两条路线斗争是政治上的两条路线斗争的反映。在那些霸占文艺舞台、文化领域，对我们实行资产阶级专政的学阀后面，站着党内走资本主义道路的当权派，
  站着窃取了共产党名义的大党阀。毛主席说：被推翻了的资产阶级采用各种方法，企图利用文艺阵地，作为腐蚀群众、准备资本主义复辟的温床。窃据文化领域领导权的反革命修正主义分子和他们的黑后台，就是这样干的。他们手里摇着笔杆子，眼睛瞪着我们的枪杆子，一心想夺我们的印把子。过去几十年，中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派作了长期斗争，缴掉了他们的枪杆子，夺取了他们的印把子，建立了无产阶级政权。全国解放以后，我们进行了一系列的社会主义改造。可是，我们还没有来得及缴掉那些国民党反动派代理人的笔杆子。笔杆子属于上层建筑，上层建筑不能保护经济基础，就要破坏经济基础。如果听任资产阶级在文化领域专我们的政，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要推翻政治、经济领域中的无产阶级专政，我们几十年革命斗争的成果，就会统统付之东流！因此，文艺批判实质上就是政治批判。不懂得无产阶级政治，不懂得社会主义条件下的阶级斗争，不懂得党内两条路线的斗争，不懂得无产阶级专政条件下还要继续革命，就不可能在文艺领域里彻底批判资产阶级。
    认识进一步提高了，我们就不仅把每一篇文艺批判文章都当作炮打资产阶级司令部的炮弹，而且把战斗从文艺舞台发展到了政治舞台，狠批文艺黑线的黑后台，狠批党内一小撮最大的走资派。在这当中，我们看过陶铸的《理想》这本书，觉得大有问题，里面堆满了黑话。我们认定这本书是大毒草。大家都说要批他！可是，批这么一个“大人物”可不是闹着玩的。究竟批不批？我们一次又一次地学习《通知》。毛主席在《通知》里说：“例如赫鲁晓夫那样的人物，他们现正睡在我们的身旁”。毛主席还教导我们：“‘舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马’，我们在为社会主义共产主义而斗争的时候，必须有这种大无畏的精神。”我们认定陶铸就是睡在以毛主席为首、以林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部身边的赫鲁晓夫式的人物。他的“官”越大，对革命的危害就越大，就越要革他的命！为了保卫毛主席，为了保卫无产阶级司令部，我们下定决心，要批他的《理想》，我们马上动手写了批判材料，向这个反革命两面派猛烈开火！
    在毛主席的英明指挥下，亿万革命群众揪出了中国赫鲁晓夫，他是反革命修正主义文艺黑线的总后台，他是国民党反动派、资产阶级和一切剥削阶级在我们党内的代理人，我们立即投入了批判中国赫鲁晓夫的战斗，决心把他批深批透，批倒批臭！
    我们深深体会到，我国亿万工农兵革命群众同文艺黑线的斗争，是你死我活的阶级斗争。毛主席说：“我国社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决。”我们一定要遵照毛主席的教导，把政治战线和思想战线上的斗争进行到底。
    用毛泽东思想去战斗，使无产阶级的思想进一步取得统治地位
    我们以江青同志为榜样，学习她一贯坚持和保卫毛主席革命文艺路线的无产阶级战斗精神，以毛泽东思想为武器，和亿万工农兵群众一起，狠批周扬及其黑后台中国赫鲁晓夫，在战斗中我们深深体会到：批判，就是用毛泽东思想去战斗，使无产阶级思想进一步取得统治地位。
    《纪要》向我们提出了一个战斗任务：“文艺上反对外国修正主义的斗争，不能只捉丘赫拉依之类的小人物。要捉大的，捉肖洛霍夫，要敢于碰他。他是修正主义文艺的鼻祖。”我们坚决响应这一战斗号召，向肖洛霍夫猛烈开火！
    听说我们要捉肖洛霍夫，有人感到惊奇：肖洛霍夫是世界有名的“大作家”，他的作品都是“大部头”，你们几个小战士也敢碰？我们说，他是资产阶级，我们还要专他的政呐，为什么不敢碰！毛主席教导我们说：“大，并不可怕。美帝国主义不是很大吗？我们顶了他一下，也没有啥。所以，世界上有些大的东西，其实并不可怕。”肖洛霍夫的反革命老本《静静的顿河》，厚厚四大本，洋洋一百五十万字，又长又臭。中外都有人把它捧为“文艺圣经”，好象“大”得碰不得，可是它越“大”，我们越觉得它很“小”，原因不是别的，就是因为它是资产阶级的货色，政治上是反动的，艺术上是腐朽的。我们决心向这株大毒草开刀！向肖洛霍夫开刀！我们在战略上藐视它，在战术上重视它。这本书写的是十月革命前后的事，我们就首先用主要时间认认真真地学习了列宁、斯大林和毛主席关于十月革命和无产阶级专政的论述，然后，怀着强烈的阶级仇恨，把《静静的顿河》看完。我们以毛泽东思想为武器，连续战斗了一个月，揭穿了《静静的顿河》疯狂反对十月革命，攻击苏维埃政权和无产阶级专政，鼓吹反革命复辟的反动实质。紧接着我们又乘胜追击，批判了他的《被开垦的处女地》《一个人的遭遇》以及现代修正主义战争文学标本——西蒙诺夫的《日日夜夜》《生者与死者》。
    这几篇批判文章，大长了工农兵群众的志气，有的同志写信表扬我们打得好，可是，国内外阶级敌人却咒骂我们“不懂艺术”“不懂历史”，“对世界名著采取轻率的态度”，等等。我们针锋相对地对他们进行了批判。
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级对资产阶级斗争，无产阶级对资产阶级专政，无产阶级在上层建筑其中包括在各个文化领域的专政，无产阶级继续清除资产阶级钻在共产党内打着红旗反红旗的代表人物等等，在这些基本问题上，难道能够允许有什么平等吗？”几百年、几千年来，剥削阶级压迫劳动人民，从来是不讲什么仁义道德，不讲什么平等的，他们也从来不许可无产阶级思想传播的。今天，我们也完全有权力、有必要实行无产阶级的思想统治，实行意识形态领域的无产阶级专政，不许可资产阶级思想传播。
    无产阶级推翻资产阶级在文化领域中的统治的战斗过程，就是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想大破资产阶级思想的过程。我们在批判一些毒草作品时，看到资产阶级“文艺批评家”所提出的一大堆什么“形象思维”论、“现实主义深化”论、“中间人物”论等等。我们决不害怕这些千奇百怪的“论”，决不陷入他们七“论”八“论”的“八卦阵”，我们坚信毛泽东思想一定能压倒资产阶级的一切谬论。我们靠毛主席的《讲话》，靠毛主席的关于阶级和阶级斗争的理论，对一株株大毒草进行了无情的揭露和批判。通过批判，我们对资产阶级的那一大堆七“论”八“论”的实质也就看得更加清楚了。那些所谓的“文艺理论”，统统是丑化工农兵，咒骂社会主义，攻击毛泽东思想的反革命谬论！
    林副主席说：“毛泽东思想是无产阶级思想的集中表现，是同私有制思想，剥削阶级思想根本对立的。……我们不用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想去战斗，资产阶级思想就会占领阵地，引起蜕化变质，出乱子。”我们在开展革命大批判中，深深体会到：是用毛泽东思想去占领一切阵地，还是让资产阶级思想占领阵地，这是关系到建立哪一个阶级思想的统治，关系到我们的政权变不变颜色的大事，是一场你死我活的阶级斗争，决不能讲什么“平等”。用毛泽东思想去战斗，彻底批判旧世界，开创一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新天地，这是历史赋予我们的光荣战斗任务。
    文化领域也要实行无产阶级的群众专政
    无产阶级专政是群众的专政。我们体会，无产阶级在文化领域中的专政，也必须实行群众的专政。过去，我们夺取政权，同拿枪的国民党打仗，要发动亿万群众，打人民战争；今天，我们巩固政权，同不拿枪的国民党反动派打仗，也要发动亿万群众，打“人民战争”。我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，就是一场对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级思想进行革命大批判的“人民战争”。开展革命的、战斗的、群众性的文艺批评，是这场“人民战争”的一个重要组成部分。七亿人民都成了批判家，就能从根本上消灭一切剥削阶级的意识形态，就能在意识形态领域也建立起强大的无产阶级专政。
    我们按照毛主席的教导，把根子扎在群众中。我们和连队的战友们一起开辟革命大批判战场，和地方上的无产阶级革命派战友共同向资产阶级猛烈开火！去年，《讲话》发表二十五周年的时候，我们到战斗在“三支”、“两军”第一线的一支毛泽东思想文艺宣传小分队去学习，和战友们一起学《讲话》，举红旗，斩黑线，批毒草，声讨反革命修正主义文艺黑线及其总后台中国赫鲁晓夫。战友们个个列举自己运用文艺武器，在“三支”、“两军”第一线宣传毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想支持无产阶级革命派的战斗体会，使我们受到了很大的教育。我们连夜把战友们的发言写成了《文艺舞台和政治舞台》《街头艺术和剧场艺术》《一场阶级斗争的对台戏》《舞台上的革命和灵魂深处的革命》《批臭〈修养〉，斩断黑线》《红舞台永远歌颂红太阳》等几篇文章，和战友们一起，进行了一场捍卫毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线的战斗。我们深深体会到：“群众是真正的英雄”。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命人民群众是最有权威的批判家。在战斗中，我们处处向群众学习，事事向群众请教，时时不忘把根子扎在群众中。我们的口号是：土里生，土里长，“一腿泥”，好得很！我们到“三支”、“两军”第一线，和红卫兵革命小将、连队战友一起口诛笔伐以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派。我们经常向战友们举办的大批判专栏学习，学习他们爱憎分明的阶级立场，学习他们无限忠于毛主席的高度阶级斗争观念和路线斗争觉悟，从群众中吸收革命的营养，用群众的思想、群众的感情、群众的语言批判资产阶级。两年来，我们在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下，在广大工农兵群众的鼓舞下，在报刊上发表了近百篇批判资产阶级的文章。我们要努力争当批判资产阶级的先锋战士！
    资产阶级和剥削阶级的旧思想，统治毒害人民几百年、几千年，是根深蒂固的。我们深深感到，仅仅依靠报刊上的批判，还不能挖掉它的老根。因此，我们除了写批判文章外，还积极参加社会上的革命大批判，向群众宣传革命大批判的意义，和无产阶级革命派的战友、红卫兵小将交流批判资产阶级的经验，有时还直接参加批判党内一小撮走资派的斗争。我们觉得，彻底批判资产阶级旧世界，清除旧社会留下的污泥浊水，必须把男女老少，从十几岁的娃娃，直到白发苍苍的老人都动员起来。我们深深感到，七亿人民都当批判家，人人都主动向资产阶级出击，就能把资产阶级和一切剥削阶级思想批深批透，批倒批臭，使毒草不能乱生乱长，自由泛滥。
    在毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的光辉照耀下，在《通知》的鼓舞下，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，亿万革命群众同旧的传统观念实行彻底的决裂，同一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，实行彻底的决裂，“从来也没有看见人民群众象现在这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发”。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，戒骄戒躁，乘胜前进，把文艺战线上两条路线的斗争进行到底，把反革命修正主义文艺黑线连同它的黑后台中国的赫鲁晓夫批深批透，批倒批臭，把混入革命文艺队伍的死不悔改的走资派、叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子统统挖出来，把社会主义条件下的政治大革命进行到底，永保无产阶级江山不变颜色，千年万载永放红光！
