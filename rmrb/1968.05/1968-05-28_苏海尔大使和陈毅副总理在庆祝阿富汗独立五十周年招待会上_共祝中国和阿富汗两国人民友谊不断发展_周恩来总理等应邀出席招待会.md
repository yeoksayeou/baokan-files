BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Ambassador Suhail of Afghanistan to China hosted a reception tonight to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Afghanistan's independence.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, as well as officials from relevant government departments and the Beijing Revolutionary Committee, were invited to attend the reception.

At the reception filled with a friendly atmosphere, Ambassador Suhail and Vice Premier Chen Yi both spoke, expressing their wishes for the continuous development of friendship between the peoples of China and Afghanistan.

In his speech, Ambassador Suhail introduced the struggle of the Afghan people for national independence and the defense of their independence. He talked about the friendly relations between Afghanistan and China. He said, "In our dealings with Chinese friends and other neighboring countries, there has not been the slightest dispute. Any problems related to us have been resolved on the basis of a long-standing tradition of friendship. Chinese friends have effectively participated in our national economic plans, thus contributing to the further strengthening of our bilateral relations. We will do our best to further enhance this friendly relationship and goodwill."

Vice Premier Chen Yi, in his speech, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, extended warm congratulations to the government and people of the Kingdom of Afghanistan. He said, "The Afghan people have waged a long and heroic struggle for their independence, writing a glorious chapter in the history of the anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian peoples. The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, once pointed out: 'Oppressed peoples and oppressed nations can never rely on the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its lackeys for their liberation, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persevering in struggle.' The victory of the Afghan people in their struggle for independence, the great victory of the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression for national salvation, and the victories of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their struggles for national independence and the defense of national independence, all prove the correctness of Chairman Mao's profound statement."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "Now, the broad masses of the people in imperialist countries and Western capitalist countries are increasingly awakening, gradually recognizing and grasping this truth. They are breaking away from the influence and shackles of a handful of revisionists, scabs, and traitors, and are launching struggles against imperialism and domestic monopolies, and for democratic rights. The recent massive black people's anti-violence struggles, student movements, and workers' movements in the United States and Western Europe have shaken the entire capitalist world. It can be said that with the deepening of the political and economic crises of imperialism, the revolutionary storm of the people of the world against imperialism led by the United States will surely become more and more turbulent and unstoppable. Now, people are increasingly seeing clearly that the rotten, decaying, and reactionary rule of imperialism is facing its doom and is on the verge of collapse."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "China and Afghanistan are friendly neighbors, and our peoples have deep friendship. In recent years, our bilateral relations have been very good. This is because we have always respected each other, helped each other, and treated each other as equals in our relations, and have never imposed on each other. We believe that the Chinese people, who have gone through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will make greater contributions to enhancing the friendship between the peoples of China and Afghanistan and developing friendly and neighborly relations between the two countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence."

Diplomats from various countries to China also attended the reception.

    苏海尔大使和陈毅副总理在庆祝阿富汗独立五十周年招待会上
    共祝中国和阿富汗两国人民友谊不断发展
    周恩来总理等应邀出席招待会
    新华社二十七日讯　阿富汗驻中国大使苏海尔今晚举行招待会，庆祝阿富汗独立五十周年。
    国务院总理周恩来、副总理陈毅，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若，以及政府有关部门、北京市革命委员会的负责人，应邀出席了招待会。
    在充满友好气氛的招待会上，苏海尔大使和陈毅副总理先后讲了话，共祝中国和阿富汗两国人民之间的友谊不断发展。
    苏海尔大使在讲话中介绍了阿富汗人民为争取和捍卫民族独立所进行的斗争，谈到了阿富汗和中国之间的友好关系。他说，我们和中国朋友及其他邻国相处当中没有丝毫争端，互相有关的任何问题都在悠久的传统友谊基础上得到了解决。中国朋友有成效地参加了我国的经济计划，从而对进一步加强我们两国关系做出了贡献。我们将尽力更进一步增进这种和睦关系和友好联系。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中代表中国政府和中国人民向阿富汗王国政府和人民表示热烈的祝贺。他说，阿富汗人民为了争取自己的独立，进行了长期的英勇斗争，在亚洲人民反帝斗争史上写下了光辉的一页。中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席曾经指出：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”阿富汗人民争取独立的胜利，越南人民抗美救国斗争的伟大胜利，亚非拉各国人民争取和捍卫民族独立的胜利，都证明了毛主席的这一英明论断。
    陈毅副总理说，现在，帝国主义国家和西欧资本主义国家的广大人民群众也正在日益觉醒，逐渐认识和掌握了这一真理。他们正在摆脱一小撮修正主义分子、工贼、叛徒的影响和束缚，开展反对帝国主义和本国垄断资本、争取民主权利的斗争。最近在美国和西欧兴起的声势浩大的黑人抗暴斗争、学生运动和工人运动，震撼了整个资本主义世界。可以肯定，随着帝国主义政治危机和经济危机的不断加深，全世界人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义的革命斗争风暴，必将更加风起云涌，势不可挡。现在人们越来越清楚地看到，腐朽的、没落的、反动的帝国主义统治已经面临末日，朝不保夕了。
    陈毅副总理说，中阿两国是友好邻邦，两国人民有着深厚的友谊。这些年来，我们两国关系一直很好。这是因为我们在相互关系中，一贯互相尊重，互相帮助，平等相待，从来不强加于人。我们相信，经过无产阶级文化大革命的中国人民，将为增进中阿两国人民的友谊，在和平共处五项原则基础上发展两国的友好睦邻关系，作出更大的贡献。
    各国驻中国使节也出席了招待会。
