Two years ago, a brilliant Marxist-Leninist historical document, the May 16, 1966 "Notice" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, was born under the personal direction of the great leader Chairman Mao.

This "Notice" is a milestone document for carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is the battle cry for the proletariat and the revolutionary masses to march against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions.

Two years is a short period. However, the revolutionary changes that have taken place in these two years are immense! The theory, line, policy, and strategy of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, as proposed by Chairman Mao in the "Notice," have smashed the fierce resistance of the bourgeois reactionary line, armed the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries and hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, and demonstrated the tremendous power of Marxism-Leninism. The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories in two years.

In the "Notice," Chairman Mao pointed out: "The whole Party must raise high the great red banner of the proletarian cultural revolution, thoroughly expose the anti-Party and anti-socialist stand of those so-called 'authorities' in the academic field, and thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary thought in the academic, educational, journalistic, literary, and publishing circles. To do this, we must at the same time criticize and purge those bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated into the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles, and some of them should be removed from their posts."

"Those bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated into the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will attempt to seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Some of these people have already been exposed, some have not yet been exposed, and some are being trusted by us and are being groomed as our successors, such as the character of Khrushchev. They are now sleeping by our side. All levels of the Party Committee must pay full attention to this."

The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years has fully confirmed Chairman Mao's foresight. People have increasingly come to realize that Chairman Mao's instructions are a creative development of the Marxist-Leninist theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat. They have profound historical significance for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country, for continuing the socialist revolution, and for the international communist movement.

In the past two years, an unprecedented large-scale mass revolutionary movement has, like a stormy sea, swept away the headquarters of the bourgeoisie within the Party, headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, and exposed those anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought counter-revolutionary revisionists, as well as those traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionary two-faced characters. It has smashed their evil plot to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country and restore capitalism.

Now, based on the large amount of irrefutable facts that have been exposed, it has been determined that the handful of top capitalist-roaders within the Party, such as the Chinese Khrushchev, represent the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. A considerable number of them are the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries. The Chinese Khrushchev, the top capitalist-roader within the Party, is a disgraceful traitor who has knelt down before imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries many times. Another top capitalist-roader within the Party, as well as Tao Zhu, Peng Dehuai, Peng Zhen, Tan Zhenlin, Luo Ruiqing, Lu Dingyi, Yang Shangkun, An Ziwen, and others, are all traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionary revisionists hiding within our Party.

These people have sneaked into our Party and occupied many important positions. They are Khrushchevs sleeping by our side, time bombs buried within our Party, and the most dangerous enemies of the proletariat under socialist conditions. Once the time is ripe, they will attempt to seize power, turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and turn the socialist system into a capitalist system, a semi-feudal semi-colonial system. China would then repeat the historical tragedy of the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union and in countries ruled by revisionist traitor cliques, and would return to the dark era of Kuomintang reactionary rule.

Our struggle against these counter-revolutionary elements is a sharp, complex, and life-and-death struggle, a great revolution in which one class overthrows another. As Chairman Mao's latest instructions have profoundly pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its leadership of the broad revolutionary masses and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. The victory of this struggle has greatly consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat."

In the past, our Party, relying on the broad revolutionary masses, waged a people's war, defeated the powerful enemies at home and abroad, and overthrew the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Now, under new historical conditions, our Party, relying on the broad revolutionary masses, continues to wage this unprecedented great political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. Those extremely cunning and treacherous bourgeois representatives, the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, who have hidden for so long and burrowed so deep, have been dug out and exposed in broad daylight under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, by mobilizing tens of millions of revolutionary masses and Red Guards.

The great victory of the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, and Red Guards in this great struggle against these class enemies will forever shine with undying revolutionary glory in the history of proletarian revolutionary struggles.

II

The mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has, with unprecedented breadth and depth, launched a revolutionary great criticism against a handful of class enemies.

Under the inspiration of the "Notice," the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses have raised high the great red banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, deeply exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of the handful of top capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in various regions and departments, who are anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. They have forcefully criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and forcefully criticized the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes.

The revolutionary great criticism has promoted the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought. The enthusiasm of the masses for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought has never been so high. People's spiritual faces have undergone tremendous changes. Successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution are emerging in the struggle.

The revolutionary great criticism has enabled the proletariat to further establish its dominant position in the ideological sphere, enabling the proletarian revolutionaries not only to overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party organizationally but also to completely overthrow them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, thereby consolidating their dominant position in politics and economics.

In the ideological and political sphere, it is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind, either the proletariat prevailing over the bourgeoisie or the bourgeoisie prevailing over the proletariat. There is no middle road to take.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionaries have waged a resolute struggle and criticism against the bourgeois reactionaries, against poisonous weeds, and against the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed. The proletariat must prevail over the bourgeoisie and must not speak of any "equality" with them. As Chairman Mao pointed out in the "Notice": "The proletariat's struggle against the bourgeoisie, the proletariat's dictatorship over the bourgeoisie, the proletariat's dictatorship in the superstructure, including in various cultural spheres, the proletariat's continued cleansing of the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated into the Communist Party and are waving the red flag to oppose the red flag, etc., on these fundamental issues, can there be any talk of equality?"

In the past two years, the great victories achieved by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country are the great achievements of the revolutionary great criticism of Mao Zedong Thought against the old ideas of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes.

Chairman Mao often says that without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution. Destruction must be based on reason, and reason is construction. With destruction as the main task, construction is also included.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in this extremely fierce class struggle, representatives of various classes and different kinds of thoughts will still take the stage. The representatives of the declining classes will still adopt various disguises, adopt two-faced tactics, and engage in deception. We must continue to implement the instruction of "destruction first, construction within," and continue to criticize the handful of top capitalist-roaders within the Party, the reactionary worldview of the bourgeoisie.

All comrades of the proletarian revolutionaries must raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely act according to Mao Zedong Thought, uphold the high principles of the proletariat, criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line represented by the Chinese Khrushchev, criticize right opportunism, right capitulationism, right splitism, and the reactionary thoughts of being "left" in form but right in essence, criticize various anti-Marxist-Leninist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought reactionary factions, criticize anarchism, factionalism, sectarianism, and various manifestations of the ideology of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, carry out the revolutionary great criticism to the end, and clear the way for the ideological victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high on all fronts.

III

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, on the basis of the revolutionary great alliance of the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses, a new revolutionary committee that implements the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" has emerged. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "'Three-in-one combination' revolutionary committees are a creation of the working class and the people in this cultural revolution."

Chairman Mao's latest instructions say:

"The basic experience of the revolutionary committees has three points: one is the representative of revolutionary cadres, one is the representative of the army, and one is the representative of the revolutionary masses, realizing the revolutionary three-in-one combination. The revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organs, streamline and reduce personnel, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses."

This revolutionary committee, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, composed of representatives of the revolutionary masses who have achieved revolutionary great alliance, representatives of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary leading cadres, is the fruit of the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses grasping Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and waging a struggle to seize power from below against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. It has greatly enriched and developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state.

The outstanding elements of the proletariat that have emerged in the mass movement directly participate in the state management of this power organ, representing the fundamental interests of the working people, and maintaining broad and close contact with the people. In this way, it can better help our various levels of leading cadres to become revolutionary, have proletarian authority, be closely connected with the masses, and be vigorous power organs. This revolutionary committee, which tightly combines the basic forces of the dictatorship of the proletariat (representatives of the revolutionary masses), the strong pillar (representatives of the People's Liberation Army), and the leading cadres (representatives of revolutionary cadres), further strengthens the unity of the military and the people, the military and the government, the cadres and the masses, strengthens the dictatorship of the proletariat, and makes our state organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat more adaptable to the needs of the socialist economic base and more adaptable to the needs of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism.

Chairman Mao has long taught us: "Without extensive people's democracy, the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be consolidated, and the power will be unstable. Without democracy, without mobilizing the masses, without the supervision of the masses, it is impossible to effectively suppress the reactionaries and bad elements, and it is also impossible to effectively reform them. They will continue to make trouble and there is still the possibility of a comeback. This problem should be alerted to, and I also hope that comrades will think about it carefully." (Speech at the 7,000 People's Conference in 1962)

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has mobilized the people to the fullest extent. The broad revolutionary masses are all concerned about the great issue of consolidating the proletarian dictatorship and are actively participating in the suppression of class enemies. This is the dictatorship of the majority over the minority, the dictatorship of the proletariat and the broad masses of the people over the bourgeoisie and all reactionaries, and the dictatorship of the people under the leadership of the proletarian party. With the gradual achievement of the overall victory of the Cultural Revolution, the establishment, improvement, and development of revolutionary committees at all levels, the dictatorship of the proletariat participated in by the masses will exert greater revolutionary power.

IV

The great historical achievements of the mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are brilliant and indelible.

The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is irresistible.

Those few class enemies who face their doom but are unwilling to die, harboring deep class hatred, frantically oppose the revolutionary mass movement and attempt to deny the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, the laws of history are merciless and do not change with their will. No matter how they engage in evil plots and sabotage activities, no matter how they stir up the evil wind of rightist reversal, in the end, they will be smashed to pieces in front of the revolutionary mass movement.

The great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country over the past two years have had a wide-ranging impact on the world, inspiring the fighting will of revolutionary people in all countries. Whether in countries ruled by imperialism and its running dogs, or in countries ruled by revisionist traitor cliques, we see the role played by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in promoting revolutionary mass movements. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has inspired the heroic spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win in the revolutionary people of the world, winning the enthusiastic support of Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has caused great fear, hatred, and panic among imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries. These bourgeois masters always pin their hopes on the "stillbirth" of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the "collapse" of the proletarian dictatorship in China. They curse the "dark future" of the Cultural Revolution like witches, but the victorious steps of the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses have shattered these masters' wild fantasies.

The surging torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is breaking through all obstacles, surging forward, and surging ahead.

We are now at a crucial moment in achieving the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The tasks of struggle that lie before us are still arduous.

Under this new situation, we should follow Chairman Mao's teachings, be humble and modest, and press forward with our victories. We must constantly summarize our experiences, frequently conduct in-depth investigations and research, be good at grasping the new trends, new characteristics, and new problems of class struggle, and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle.

We must resolutely defend the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, expose and smash all the plots and tricks of the class enemies to sabotage the proletarian headquarters. We must further purify and consolidate our class ranks, unite and win over allies, and continue to launch attacks on the class enemies. We must strictly distinguish between contradictions among the people and contradictions between the enemy and us. For errors within the revolutionary ranks, we must adhere to Chairman Mao's traditional policy of "punishing the past to prevent the future and curing the sickness to save the person."

We must start from the fundamental issues of the two-line struggle, carry out the revolutionary great criticism more deeply. We must criticize the reactionary thoughts of the bourgeoisie from the right and the "left," resolutely oppose right opportunism, right capitulationism, and right splitism, and thoroughly smash the evil wind of rightist reversal.

We must launch a greater mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, continue to vigorously run Mao Zedong Thought study classes, vigorously consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination by system, by industry, and by class, unite the majority of cadres and masses, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform in various units, seize the revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness for war, and do a better job in all aspects of work.

The great People's Liberation Army has made tremendous contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must continue to carry out the movement of supporting the army and loving the people and strengthen the unity of the military and the people.

We must cherish and support the newly born revolutionary committees, make them more consolidated and perfect, and make them the battle command posts that hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and highlight proletarian politics. The revolutionary committees should lead millions of people to win new victories and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Let us firmly unite under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and strive unremittingly to complete the great historical task of the first Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in human history! New victories are calling us forward, let us advance bravely!

    划时代的文献
    ——纪念《通知》发表两周年
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》编辑部
    两年前，一个光辉的马克思列宁主义的历史文件，中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，在伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持下诞生了。
    这个《通知》，是进行无产阶级文化大革命的划时代的文献，是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级和广大革命群众向资产阶级和一切剥削阶级进军的战斗号令。
     两年的时间是短暂的。但是，这两年发生的革命变化是多么巨大啊！毛主席在《通知》中提出的无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，粉碎了资产阶级反动路线的重重抵抗，武装了我国无产阶级革命派和亿万革命群众，发挥出马克思列宁主义的巨大威力，史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，在两年中已经取得了决定性的胜利。
    一
    毛主席在《通知》中指出：全党必须“高举无产阶级文化革命的大旗，彻底揭露那批反党反社会主义的所谓‘学术权威’的资产阶级反动立场，彻底批判学术界、教育界、新闻界、文艺界、出版界的资产阶级反动思想，夺取在这些文化领域中的领导权。而要做到这一点，必须同时批判混进党里、政府里、军队里和文化领域的各界里的资产阶级代表人物，清洗这些人，有些则要调动他们的职务。”
    “混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。这些人物，有些已被我们识破了，有些则还没有被识破，有些正在受到我们信用，被培养为我们的接班人，例如赫鲁晓夫那样的人物，他们现正睡在我们的身旁，各级党委必须充分注意这一点。”
    两年来无产阶级文化大革命的实践，充分证实了毛主席的英明预见。人们越来越深刻地认识到，毛主席的这些指示，是对于马克思列宁主义无产阶级专政学说创造性的发展，它对于我国巩固无产阶级专政，继续进行社会主义革命，对于国际共产主义运动，都具有深远的历史作用。
    在这两年中规模空前巨大的革命群众运动，象大海的怒涛，把隐藏在我们党内的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部冲垮了，把那些反共、反人民、反毛泽东思想的反革命修正主义分子，把那些叛徒、特务、反革命两面派冲刷出来了，粉碎了他们妄图颠覆我国无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。
    现在，根据揭发出来的大量的确凿事实，已经查明，中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派，是代表国民党反动派利益，代表帝国主义、资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右利益的反革命黑帮。其中，相当一部分人，就是国民党反动派的残渣余孽。中国赫鲁晓夫，这个党内头号的走资派，就是多次跪倒在帝国主义和国民党反动派脚下的可耻叛徒。党内另一个最大的走资派以及陶铸、彭德怀、彭真、谭震林、罗瑞卿、陆定一、杨尚昆、安子文等等，都是隐藏在我们党内的形形色色的叛徒、特务和反革命修正主义分子。
    这些家伙，钻到了我们党里，窃据了不少重要的岗位。他们是睡在我们身边的赫鲁晓夫，是埋在我们党内的定时炸弹，是社会主义条件下无产阶级的最危险的敌人。一旦时机成熟，他们就要夺取政权，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政，变社会主义制度为资本主义制度、半封建半殖民地制度，中国就会重演苏联和一些被修正主义叛徒集团统治的国家复辟资本主义的历史悲剧，就会回到国民党反动统治的黑暗时代。
    我们同这些反革命分子的斗争，是一场尖锐、复杂的、你死我活的斗争，是一个阶级推翻另一个阶级的大革命。正如毛主席最新指示所深刻指出的那样：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”这个斗争的胜利，极大地巩固了无产阶级专政。
    过去，我们党依靠广大革命人民群众，进行人民战争，打败了国内外强大的敌人，推翻了国民党的反动统治。现在，在新的历史条件下，我们党又依靠广大革命人民群众，继续进行这场史无前例的无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命。象那些极端狡猾，极端阴险毒辣，藏了那么久，钻得那么深的资产阶级的代表人物，国民党反动派的残渣余孽，正是在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，发动起几万万革命群众和红卫兵小将，才把他们挖出来，暴露在光天化日之下的。
    中国无产阶级革命派，亿万革命群众和红卫兵小将，在这场大革命中对这些阶级敌人进行惊心动魄斗争的伟大胜利，在无产阶级革命斗争史上，将永远闪耀着不灭的战斗的光辉。
    二
    无产阶级文化大革命的群众运动，以从来没有过的广度和深度，对一小撮阶级敌人展开了革命的大批判。
    在《通知》的鼓舞下，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判的大旗，深刻地揭露和批判了党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在各地区各部门的代理人的反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，有力地批判了反革命修正主义路线，有力地批判了资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯。
    革命的大批判，促进了毛泽东思想的大普及。群众活学活用毛泽东思想的热情，从来也没有象今天这样高涨。人们的精神面貌发生了巨大的变化。无产阶级革命事业的接班人，正在斗争中涌现出来。
    革命的大批判，使无产阶级在思想上进一步取得统治地位，使无产阶级革命派不仅在组织上打倒党内一小撮走资派，而且在政治上、思想上、理论上把他们彻底打倒，从而巩固在政治上、经济上取得的统治地位。
    在政治思想领域中，不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，不是无产阶级压倒资产阶级，就是资产阶级压倒无产阶级。没有中间道路可走。　
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级革命派对资产阶级反动派，对毒草，对没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，就是要坚决斗争，坚决批判。无产阶级就是要压倒资产阶级，对他们决不能讲什么“平等”。正如毛主席在《通知》中所指出的：“无产阶级对资产阶级斗争，无产阶级对资产阶级专政，无产阶级在上层建筑其中包括在各个文化领域的专政，无产阶级继续清除资产阶级钻在共产党内打着红旗反红旗的代表人物等等，在这些基本问题上，难道能够允许有什么平等吗？”
    两年来，我国无产阶级文化大革命运动所取得的伟大胜利，就是毛泽东思想对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级旧思想进行革命大批判的伟大成果。
    毛主席经常说，不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。
    在这个史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，在这个极其剧烈的阶级斗争中，各个阶级的代表人物，各种不同的思想，都还会登台表演。那些没落阶级的代表人物，还会采取不同的伪装，采取两面派手法，进行欺骗。我们必须继续执行“破字当头，立在其中”的指示，对党内一小撮最大的走资派，对资产阶级的反动世界观继续进行批判。
    一切无产阶级革命派的同志们，必须高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚决按照毛泽东思想办事，坚持无产阶级的高度原则性，批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的反革命修正主义路线，批判右倾机会主义和形“左”实右的反动思想，批判各种反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的反动流派，批判无政府主义，批判山头主义、宗派主义，批判资产阶级以及一切剥削阶级意识形态的各种表现，把革命的大批判进行到底，为无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利从思想上扫清道路。使毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在各条战线上高高飘扬。
    三
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，在无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众实行革命的大联合的基础上，出现了崭新的实行革命“三结合”的革命委员会。正如毛主席指出：“‘三结合’的革命委员会，是工人阶级和人民群众在这次文化大革命中的一种创造。”
    毛主席最新指示说：
    “革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”
    这种在毛泽东思想指引下，由实现了革命大联合的革命群众的代表、人民解放军的代表、革命领导干部参加的革命委员会，是无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众掌握了毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论，对党内一小撮走资派进行自下而上的夺权斗争的丰硕果实。它大大地丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义的国家学说。
    群众运动中涌现出来的无产阶级的优秀分子直接参加国家管理的这种权力机构，代表着工农劳动群众的根本利益，同人民群众保持着广泛的、密切的联系。这样，就能够更好地帮助我们的各级领导班子的革命化，更好地帮助各级领导班子成为革命的、有无产阶级权威的、密切联系群众的、朝气蓬勃的权力机构。这种把无产阶级专政的基础力量（革命群众代表）、坚强柱石（人民解放军代表）、领导骨干（革命干部代表）紧密结合在一起的革命委员会，进一步加强了军民的团结，军政的团结，干群的团结，强化了无产阶级专政，使我们的无产阶级专政的国家机构更加适应社会主义经济基础的需要，更加适应巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的需要。
    毛主席早就教导我们：“没有广泛的人民民主，无产阶级专政不能巩固，政权会不稳。没有民主，没有把群众发动起来，没有群众的监督，就不可能对反动分子和坏分子实行有效的专政，也不可能对他们进行有效的改造，他们就会继续捣乱，还有复辟的可能。这个问题应当警惕，也希望同志们好好想一想。”（一九六二年在七千人大会上的讲话）
    无产阶级文化大革命，把人民群众最充分地发动起来了。广大革命群众，都在关心巩固无产阶级政权的大问题，积极参加对阶级敌人的专政。这是绝大多数人对极少数人的专政，是无产阶级和广大人民群众对资产阶级和一切反动分子的专政，是在无产阶级政党领导下的人民群众的专政。随着文化大革命的逐步取得全面胜利，各级革命委员会的建立、健全和发展，发动广大人民群众参加的无产阶级专政，将越来越发挥出巨大的革命威力。
    四
    无产阶级文化大革命群众运动所建立的伟大历史功勋，是灿烂辉煌的，不可磨灭的。
    无产阶级文化大革命群众运动的胜利是不可抗拒的。
    那些面临末日而又不甘心自己死亡的一小撮阶级敌人，怀着刻骨的阶级仇恨，疯狂地反对革命的群众运动，妄图否定无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。但是，历史的规律是无情的，不以他们的意志为转移的。不管他们怎样进行罪恶的阴谋破坏活动，不管他们怎样掀起右倾翻案的妖风，到头来，只能在革命群众运动的面前撞得粉身碎骨。
    我国无产阶级文化大革命两年来巨大胜利的影响，广阔地波及到全世界，鼓舞了各国革命人民的战斗意志。无论在帝国主义及其走狗统治的国家，在修正主义叛徒集团统治的国家，我们都看见无产阶级文化大革命在推动革命的群众运动方面所起的一定作用。在毛泽东思想指引下的无产阶级文化大革命，激发了全世界革命人民敢于斗争、敢于胜利的英雄气概，赢得了全世界马克思列宁主义者和广大革命人们的热情支持。
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命，激起了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派极大的恐惧、仇恨和惊慌。这些资产阶级的老爷们，总是把希望寄托在中国无产阶级文化大革命的“夭折”，寄托在中国无产阶级政权的“垮台”。他们象巫婆那样，恶毒地诅咒“文化革命前景暗淡”。但是，我国无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众胜利前进的步伐，踏碎了这些老爷们的痴心妄想。
    我国无产阶级文化大革命的滚滚洪流，正在冲决一切障碍，汹涌澎湃，奔腾向前。
    我们正处在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻。我们面临的斗争任务仍然是艰巨的。
    在这种新的形势下，我们应该遵照毛主席的教导，戒骄戒躁，乘胜前进。我们要不断地总结经验，要经常深入地注意调查研究，善于掌握阶级斗争的新动向、新特点、新问题，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向。
    要坚决维护以毛主席为首、以林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导，揭露和粉碎阶级敌人破坏无产阶级司令部的一切阴谋诡计。要进一步纯洁和巩固自己的阶级队伍，团结和争取同盟军，向阶级敌人继续发动进攻。要严格区别敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾。对于革命队伍内部的错误，必须坚持毛主席“惩前毖后，治病救人”的传统方针。
    要从两条路线的大是大非出发，更加深入地开展革命的大批判。要批判来自右的和极“左”的方面的资产阶级反动思想，坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾投降主义、右倾分裂主义，彻底粉碎右倾翻案的妖风。
    我们要掀起更大规模的活学活用毛泽东思想的群众性的热潮，继续大力办好毛泽东思想学习班，大力巩固和发展按系统、按行业、按班级的革命的大联合和革命的三结合，团结干部和群众的大多数，搞好各单位的斗、批、改，抓革命、促生产、促工作、促战备，把各方面的工作做得更好。
    伟大的中国人民解放军，在无产阶级文化大革命中立下了巨大的功勋。我们要继续开展拥军爱民运动，加强军民团结。
    我们要爱护和支持新生的革命委员会，使它不断地巩固和完善，使它成为高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、突出无产阶级政治的战斗指挥部。革命委员会应当领导千百万群众去夺取新的胜利，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    让我们坚定地团结在毛泽东思想旗帜下，坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为全面地完成人类历史上第一次无产阶级文化大革命的伟大历史任务而坚持不懈地战斗吧！新的胜利在前面召唤我们，让我们奋勇前进！
