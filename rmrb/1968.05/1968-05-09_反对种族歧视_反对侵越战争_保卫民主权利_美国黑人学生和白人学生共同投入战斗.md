	Oppose Racial Discrimination, Oppose the Vietnam War, Defend Democratic Rights
	Black and White Students in the U.S. Jointly Engage in the Struggle

	BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) — WASHINGTON — The progressive student movement in the United States has seen further development in recent days, with students from several famous universities engaging in struggles against racial discrimination, the Vietnam War, and for the defense of students' democratic rights. Black and white students have jointly entered the battle.

	The strike by students at Columbia University in New York City has lasted for about half a month. On May 6, the university administration announced the resumption of classes, but striking students set up picket lines in the campus and declared a continuation of the strike. About 80 percent of the students in the entire school refused to attend classes. Columbia College, the largest and oldest college within Columbia University, was forced to announce early vacation on May 6. However, the striking students and faculty members continued their struggle on the school's lawns and the steps in front of the buildings. During the occupation of the school buildings, Columbia University students also hoisted red flags and hung portraits of Malcolm X, the American black leader who was assassinated several years ago by American imperialists.

	More than a hundred black students studying at Northwestern University in Illinois occupied the school's administrative building on May 3 to support the struggle of Columbia University students and put forward their own demands. Many white students at this school immediately took action to support the black students' struggle, occupying the office of the school's dean.

	Many students at Stanford University in California occupied the school's administrative building on May 7 to protest the persecution of student organization leaders by the school authorities. Students also burned down a building used by the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps within the school.

	Several hundred black and white students at Cheyney State College in Pennsylvania jointly occupied the college's administrative building on May 6, forcing the college to suspend classes.

　　美国黑人学生和白人学生共同投入战斗
    新华社八日讯　华盛顿消息：美国进步学生运动最近几天有了进一步发展，又有好几个著名大学的学生进行了反对种族歧视、反对侵越战争和保卫学生民主权利的斗争。黑人学生和白人学生共同投入了战斗。
    纽约市哥伦比亚大学学生的大罢课已坚持了约半个月。五月六日，哥伦比亚大学校方宣布复课，但是罢课学生在校园内布置了纠察线，宣布继续罢课，全校约有百分之八十的学生拒绝上课。哥伦比亚大学中最大和最老的学院——哥伦比亚学院，已不得不在六日宣布提前放假。但是罢课的学生和教员在学校的草地上，大楼前的台阶上坚持斗争。哥伦比亚大学学生在占领学校大楼期间，还曾在这些大楼上插上红旗，挂起几年前被美帝国主义分子暗杀的美国黑人领袖马尔科姆·爱克斯的像。
    在伊利诺斯州西北大学学习的百余名黑人学生，为了支持哥伦比亚大学学生的斗争，三日占领了这个学校的行政大楼，并且提出了自己的要求。这个学校的许多白人学生立即行动起来支持黑人学生的斗争，占领了这个学校教务长的办公室。
    加利福尼亚州的斯坦福大学的许多学生，七日占领了学校的行政大楼，抗议学校当局对学生组织领导人的迫害。学生还烧毁了这个学校里的海军预备军官训练队的一个建筑物。
    宾夕法尼亚州州立切尼学院数百名黑人学生和白人学生，六日共同占领了学院的行政大楼，迫使学院不得不因此停课。
