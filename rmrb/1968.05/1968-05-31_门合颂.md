Ode to Gate Merge
By Guo Degui, a member of the Beijing Siqing Commune

I
The mountain redbud blooms red like fire,
In the era of Mao Zedong, heroes abound!
The deeds of Li Wenzhong are being sung,
The song of Gate Merge is composed anew!
The snow-covered plum blossoms and the pines on the mountains,
Without you, there would be no red, no green!
A glorious life, a heart ablaze,
Completely, thoroughly for the people.
Mao Zedong Thought arms us,
"Even if the mountains crumble and the earth splits, we dare to go up!"
The pines stand unyielding, the flag flies higher,
Gate Merge continues to charge forward!

II
The revolutionary path is thousands of miles long,
Gate Merge follows Chairman Mao step by step!
Against the wind and waves,
Chairman Mao steers the course.
Chairman Mao instructs Gate Merge to follow,
Standing guard for Chairman Mao at all times!
On sentry duty, on the front lines,
Gate Merge is Chairman Mao's good sentinel!
Capturing demons, slaying wolves,
Fighting bravely at the forefront!
Gate Merge denounces Peng Dehuai,
Not allowing the army's colors to be changed!
Striking down the Chinese Khrushchev,
Resolutely not taking the backward road!
Indignant denunciation of Luo Ronghuan,
Not allowing him to rebel and usurp the military!
Mao Zedong Thought's red flag is held high,
Unshaken even if the heavens fall and the earth crumbles!

III
Chairman Mao waves his hand and issues a call,
The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution surges high.
The Yangtze and the Yellow Rivers flow swiftly,
Gate Merge follows Chairman Mao closely.
Melons connected to vines, trees connected to roots,
Gate Merge's heart is close to Chairman Mao's.
Thunder roars for thousands of miles, lightning flashes for tens of thousands of miles,
Chairman Mao's latest instructions reach the grasslands.
"The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left,"
Gate Merge supports the left with the utmost firmness!
Shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand,
Soldiers and civilians fight together!
Mist covers the grasslands layer by layer,
It cannot obscure the eyes of the revolutionary left!
Dark clouds gather over Baqen,
They cannot crush the heroic Gate Merge!
Rivers flow into the sea unceasingly,
Day and night, thinking of Chairman Mao.
"When the rooster crows, the world turns white,"
Chairman Mao's glory shines over Qinghai!
The waters of Qinghai Lake laugh loudly,
The revolutionary great alliance surges like a spring tide!
The great criticism unfolds its battle,
Soldiers and civilians beat the fallen dogs!
On the line of supporting the left, new achievements are made,
Gate Merge is the most loyal to Chairman Mao!

IV
Trees, branches, and roots are connected,
Gate Merge's heart is connected with the masses.
The wind blows sand and stones against the door,
Gate Merge's heart flies to the sentry post.
He has walked through all the sentry posts of the platoon,
Standing guard for Chairman Mao...
When the soldiers' families come to the unit,
Gate Merge serves tea and water.
Melons do not leave the vines, fish do not leave the water,
The bond between soldiers and civilians is precious.
How many times has Gate Merge taken off his leather jacket,
And draped it over the poor and lower-middle peasants...
How many times has Gate Merge carried a lamb in his arms,
Braved the wind and snow to return it to the Tibetans.
"The Three Articles" shine brightly,
Helping the poor peasants build their houses...
One soldier, one soldier, one flag,
Gate Merge will always be with the masses!
A red heart towards the sun,
"Everything for Chairman Mao!"

V
Trees have roots, water has a source,
Mao Zedong Thought writes a new chapter.
Born in the sea of bitterness, grown under the red flag,
Chairman Mao came, and Gate Merge was liberated!
Mao Zedong Thought nurtures heroes,
Heroes' hearts turn towards Mao Zedong.
Stars in the sky point to the North Star,
Gate Merge follows Chairman Mao!
The golden axe that opens mountains, the pillar that supports the sky,
Mao Zedong Thought opens new paths!
The lighthouse in the fog, the spring in the desert,
Mao Zedong Thought is the steering wheel!
The pearls in the sea, the treasures in the mountains,
Chairman Mao's works are the treasure among treasures.
Gate Merge listens to Chairman Mao's words,
Dares to climb the mountain of knives, dare to descend into the sea of fire!
Gate Merge listens to Chairman Mao's words,
Treads on the ghosts and demons underfoot!
Gate Merge listens to Chairman Mao's words,
Fears neither heaven nor earth!
Gate Merge "thinks of everything for Chairman Mao,"
In the wind and waves, the path is not lost!
Gate Merge "obeys Chairman Mao in everything,"
Chairman Mao's words are firmly remembered!
Gate Merge "follows Chairman Mao in everything,"
Achieves victory in battle after battle!
Gate Merge "does everything for Chairman Mao,"
A magnificent youth sings a song of loyalty!
Mount Everest is short, Tian Shan is low,
The hero Gate Merge stands tall and firm!
The red flowers of the grasslands, steel in the fire,
Gate Merge sets an example for us.
The unyielding red flowers planted by Chairman Mao,
All bloom towards Chairman Mao!
The high-quality steel forged by Chairman Mao,
Every piece is as strong as Gate Merge!

The sea roars, the mountain wind howls—
We swear to Chairman Mao:
"The sea may dry up, the rocks may crumble,
Our red hearts loyal to you will never change!"
"The mountains may shake, the earth may crumble,
Our loyalty to your brilliant thoughts is boundless!"
"Our blood may flow, our heads may be cut off,
We will defend your revolutionary line to the death!"
"We will forever be infinitely loyal to you,
Bravely seize new victories in the revolution!"
"Revolution to the end, never turning back,
We will plant your brilliant red flag all over the world!"
