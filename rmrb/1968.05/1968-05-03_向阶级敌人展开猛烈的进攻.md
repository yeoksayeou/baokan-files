In the thunderous battle cry of seizing a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, on the glorious "May Day," our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin celebrated the night of May Day with the people and military of the capital. Upon hearing this good news, we were overjoyed. We extend our warmest congratulations to our great teacher Chairman Mao, wishing him eternal life! Eternal life!

Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution launched by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The class struggle practice in our Huangtugang Commune fully confirms Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in our commune was extremely complex and sharp. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely fought against a handful of capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists within the Party, achieving significant victories. For example, in the Hongtaizhu Production Brigade, under the protection of capitalist roaders within the Party, rich peasants and unscrupulous cadres colluded to commit evil deeds and do all sorts of bad things. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they again flew the banner of "rebels," deceiving and cheating, striking and framing revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants, attempting to restore capitalism. In response to this situation, we held a class struggle study class in this brigade, focusing on the class struggle, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, and emphasizing bitter-sweet class education. This awakened many deceived masses, who exposed these few bad elements, launched a struggle of criticism, greatly boosted the revolutionary spirit of the poor and lower-middle peasants, thoroughly crushed the counter-revolutionary arrogance of the class enemies, greatly strengthened the proletarian dictatorship, and brought about new prospects for revolution and production.

The poor and lower-middle peasants said: Chairman Mao's latest instructions are as if pointing out the situation in our village. Our struggle against these bad elements is a continuation of the struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries. Liu Shaoqi's spreading the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" is extremely reactionary. We poor and lower-middle peasants will not be deceived. We must firmly remember the great teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao to "never forget class struggle" and fight all class enemies to the end.

As Chairman Mao pointed out: "Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." Through firmly grasping class struggle and deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary and production situation in our commune has become better and better. However, the serious facts of class struggle tell us that class enemies will never willingly accept their destruction. The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to comprehensive victory, the more they will struggle desperately. We must not be the least bit complacent or slack off because of victory. We must, in the new situation of struggle, persist in and carry forward the thorough and resolute revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, continue to fight, launch an even more ferocious attack, expose all class enemies, fight them to the end, and fight them to stink, not resting until we achieve complete victory!

　　向阶级敌人展开猛烈的进攻
　　农业劳动模范、北京市丰台区黄土岗人民公社革命委员会主任　殷维臣
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的震天战鼓声中，在光辉的“五一”节日里，我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席同首都军民欢度“五一”之夜。我们听到这个好消息，高兴极了。我们最热烈地敬祝我们的伟大导师毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”我们黄土岗公社的阶级斗争实践，千真万确地证实了毛主席这一英明论断。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们公社里两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争十分复杂、尖锐，广大贫下中农和革命干部紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，同党内一小撮走资派、叛徒、特务、地富反坏右分子，进行了坚决的斗争，取得了重大的胜利。如洪太庄生产队，过去在党内走资派的包庇下，富农分子和四不清干部互相勾结，为非作歹，干尽坏事，在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们又打着“造反派”的旗号，招摇撞骗，打击陷害革命干部和贫下中农，妄图搞资本主义复辟。针对这种情况，我们在这个生产队开办了以阶级斗争为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班，反复学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，狠抓忆苦思甜的阶级教育，使一些受蒙蔽的群众纷纷觉悟，把这几个坏家伙揪了出来，展开批判斗争，大长了贫下中农的革命斗志，大灭了阶级敌人的反革命气焰，大大加强了无产阶级专政，使革命生产都出现了新气象。
    贫下中农说：毛主席的最新指示，就象指着我们村的情况说的，我们和这些坏人的斗争，就是同国民党反动派的斗争的继续。中国赫鲁晓夫散布什么“阶级斗争熄灭”论，真是反动透顶。我们贫下中农决不上当，一定要牢记伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，把一切阶级敌人统统斗倒斗臭。
    正如毛主席指出的：“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”通过狠抓阶级斗争和深入开展革命大批判，我们公社的革命和生产形势越来越好。但是，严重的阶级斗争事实告诉我们，阶级敌人是决不甘心自己的灭亡的，无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，他们越要进行垂死挣扎。我们决不能因为胜利而有一点点的麻痹松懈，一定要在新的斗争形势下，坚持和发扬无产阶级的坚决彻底革命精神，再接再厉，展开更猛烈的进攻，把一切阶级敌人统统揪出来斗倒斗臭，不获全胜，决不收兵！
