Revolutionary workers of the Jiangxi Automobile Factory have displayed revolutionary initiative and creativity, producing the first batch of Jian Gangshan-brand automobiles through self-reliance. The revolutionary workers have severely criticized the reactionary line of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party who only believe in foreign doctrines and bourgeois technical "authorities." In just four months, they have realized the goal of mass-producing automobiles.

New China News Agency, Nanchang, May 10 — The revolutionary workers of the Jiangxi Automobile Factory, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have resolutely taken the road of self-reliance. In just four months, they have successfully produced the first batch of Jian Gangshan-brand automobiles.

The Jian Gangshan-brand automobile has a load capacity of 2.5 tons, is easy to start, and has good hill-climbing performance. The first batch consists of 12 vehicles. This successful trial production in batches demonstrates the tremendous power of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist roaders within the factory believed only in foreign equipment, foreign doctrines, and bourgeois technical "authorities," following the expert path and not allowing workers to get involved. As a result, during the trial production process, most parts had to rely on external assistance, and the quality did not meet the standards. They then changed the professional automobile manufacturing plant into a repair and parts factory. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary faction in this factory overthrew the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, changing the "Automobile Parts Factory" back to the "Automobile Manufacturing Factory." They carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, quickly realizing the goal of mass-producing automobiles.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We advocate self-reliance. We hope for foreign aid, but we cannot depend on it. We rely on our own efforts and the creativity of the entire army and people." In the process of producing automobiles, the broad revolutionary workers of this factory, with the help of the stationed People's Liberation Army, followed Chairman Mao's teaching, severely criticized the reactionary line of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party who rely on external assistance and bourgeois technical "authorities." The broad revolutionary workers fully displayed their revolutionary initiative and creativity, personally making 12 special-purpose machine tools and over 100 molds and fixtures, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient equipment. For example, the cylinder block is a component with relatively high precision requirements. In the past, bourgeois technical "authorities" had never succeeded in making it. Now, a group of three third-level workers has used collective wisdom and strength to cast 100% qualified products. Without large-scale equipment for forging and pressing large beams, the forging and pressing large beam group found ways to press out qualified products.

    新华社南昌十日电江西汽车制造厂革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定不移地走自力更生的革命道路，在短短四个月的时间内，成功地生产了第一批井冈山牌汽车。
    井冈山牌汽车，载重二吨半，起动容易，爬坡性能好，第一批共生产了十二辆。这次成批试生产成功，显示了毛主席无产阶级革命路线的无比威力。
    无产阶级文化大革命以前，厂内一小撮走资派只相信洋设备、洋教条和资产阶级技术“权威”，走专家路线，不让工人过问。结果，在试生产过程中，大部分零件都靠外援，质量达不到标准，他们便把专业性的汽车制造厂改为修理、配件厂。在无产阶级文化大革命中，这个厂的无产阶级革命派造了党内一小撮走资派的反，改“汽车配件厂”为“汽车制造厂”。他们发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，很快实现了成批生产汽车的愿望。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我们是主张自力更生的。我们希望有外援，但是我们不能依赖它，我们依靠自己的努力，依靠全体军民的创造力。”在生产汽车的过程中，这个厂的广大革命职工在驻厂解放军的帮助下，遵照毛主席的这一教导，狠批了党内一小撮走资派依靠外援，依靠资产阶级技术“权威”的反动路线。广大革命职工充分发挥革命的积极性和创造性，自己动手制造了十二台专用机床、一百多件模夹具，克服了设备不足的困难。如汽缸体是一个精密度要求相当高的部件，过去，资产阶级技术“权威”一直没有搞成。现在，由三个三级技工组成的汽缸体小组，发挥集体的智慧和力量，浇铸出了百分之百的合格品。锻压大梁没有大型设备，锻工大梁小组的同志就想方设法压出了合格产品。
