Great Mao Zedong Thought is inspiring Japanese revolutionary workers in their heroic and tenacious struggle against American imperialism, modern revisionism, and Japanese reactionaries.

Guided by Mao Zedong Thought

Recently, a Chinese journalist visited a steel worker named Yodogawa in Shimonoseki City. Yodogawa said that they are arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought to fight against modern revisionism and the right-wing social democrats who control the yellow unions. Yodogawa and others, through studying Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," deeply felt that to arm the working class with Mao Zedong Thought and inspire Japanese workers to fight better, it is necessary to thoroughly eliminate the influence of the reactionary ideas of modern revisionism and right-wing social democrats. They decided to use their own strength to publish a factory newspaper that propagates Mao Zedong Thought and inspires the fighting spirit of the workers.

In the process of editing the newspaper, Yodogawa and others always remembered Chairman Mao's great teachings: "We stand on the side of the proletariat and the people." "All dark forces that harm the people must be exposed, and all revolutionary struggles of the people must be praised." They turned this factory newspaper into a powerful weapon to expose the crimes of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the Miyamoto revisionist group of the Japanese Communist Party, and enthusiastically inspired the various struggles of the working class, which was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers.

Yodogawa said: Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is an inexhaustible treasure for revolutionaries. He said: When I encounter problems in my struggle and in editing the newspaper, I consult this great work and always use Mao Zedong Thought to guide my actions.

Whatever the enemy supports, we must oppose

Nearly Tokyo's Yokota Air Base, there is a "chemical plant" that produces large quantities of poison gas, bullets, and shells for the U.S. imperialist invasion of Vietnam. The Sato traitor government also uses the poison gas produced by this plant to attack and suppress the Japanese people who are fighting against the U.S. for national justice. The criminal collusion of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries has aroused the strong indignation and resolute opposition of the Japanese people.

Recently, workers in the Tama area of Tokyo have held consecutive meetings and demonstrations to oppose the production of weapons for the U.S. imperialist massacre of the Vietnamese people. Thousands of workers took action, distributing leaflets at train stations and residential areas to expose the criminal acts of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. Some workers even rushed to the residence of the plant manager to express their protest.

The Sato government, a faithful dog of U.S. imperialism, brazenly sent armed police and plainclothes agents to suppress the workers' protests. However, the enemy's suppression only further aroused the strong resistance of Japanese workers.

A militant activist, Kura, said, we firmly oppose U.S. imperialism's invasion of Vietnam and the Sato reactionary government's service to the U.S. war in Vietnam. Our anti-U.S. patriotic struggle is just. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." We Japanese workers are fighting resolutely against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries based on this teaching of Chairman Mao.

Unfazed by threats and strikes, persist in anti-revisionist struggle

A taxi driver named Matsumoto in Osaka has been consistently studying Chairman Mao's quotations. He said, Chairman Mao's great teachings have made me see who is a true revolutionary and who is a false revolutionary. He is not afraid of the threats and strikes from the Japanese revisionists and continues to study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought.

Matsumoto also actively distributes newspapers and magazines that propagate Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China to his colleagues, sometimes even pasting these newspapers on the walls of the workplace to propagate to the masses.

The Miyamoto revisionist group of the Japanese Communist Party, which hates and fears the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, uses threats, beatings, and other despicable means to try to stop Matsumoto's revolutionary actions. However, Matsumoto always remembers Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." He remains unshakable and resolutely fights against the conspiracies of Japanese revisionists.

Once, Matsumoto and his colleagues, at a meeting attended by more than a hundred people, listed a series of facts about how the Japanese revisionists betrayed the people in their anti-U.S. struggles at Haneda Airport, Sasebo Port, and Sanrizuka in Chiba Prefecture, exposing the ugly face of the Miyamoto group and leaving the Japanese revisionists speechless and in disarray.

Matsumoto, with deep feelings for Chairman Mao, told the Chinese journalist, Chairman Mao is the great leader of the revolutionary people of the world. Chairman Mao has creatively developed Marxism-Leninism and brought it to the highest level of the contemporary era.

Matsumoto said, Chairman Mao's words are all truths. Chairman Mao's teachings have strengthened the hope and confidence of the Japanese people for the future. I am convinced that as long as the Japanese people hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and persist in the great truth of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" pointed out by Chairman Mao, the Japanese revolution will surely achieve victory.

### 毛泽东思想鼓舞日本革命工人同帝修反英勇斗争

　　毛泽东思想鼓舞日本革命工人同帝修反英勇斗争
    据新华社讯　伟大的毛泽东思想鼓舞着日本革命工人同美帝国主义、现代修正主义和日本反动派进行英勇顽强的斗争。
　　用毛泽东思想指导自己的行动
    不久以前，中国记者访问了下关市一位姓淀川的钢厂工人。淀川说，他们正在用毛泽东思想武装自己，同现代修正主义和右翼社会民主主义者把持的黄色工会进行斗争。淀川等通过学习毛主席光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，深深感到为了用毛泽东思想武装工人阶级，鼓舞日本工人更好地起来斗争，必须彻底肃清修正主义和右翼社会民主主义者的反动思想的影响。他们决定用自己的力量，出版一种宣传毛泽东思想、鼓舞工人斗志的厂内报纸。
    在编报过程中，淀川等人牢记毛主席的伟大教导：“我们是站在无产阶级的和人民大众的立场。”“一切危害人民群众的黑暗势力必须暴露之，一切人民群众的革命斗争必须歌颂之”。他们把这份厂报，办成揭露美日反动派和日共宫本修正主义集团的有力武器，热情地鼓舞了工人阶级的各项斗争，受到了广大工人的热烈欢迎。
    淀川说：毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，是革命者取之不尽、用之不竭的宝库。他说：我在斗争中和在编报中遇到了问题，就向这部伟大著作请教，随时用毛泽东思想指导自己的行动。
　　凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对
    在美帝国主义设有军事基地的东京横田附近，有一家为美帝侵略越南生产大量毒气、枪弹和炮弹的“化工厂”。佐藤卖国政府还使用这个工厂生产的毒气，袭击和镇压进行反美爱国正义斗争的日本人民。美日反动派的这一罪恶勾当，激起了日本人民的强烈愤怒和坚决反对。
    最近，东京三多摩地区的工人连续举行集会和示威游行，反对为美帝国主义生产屠杀越南人民的武器。数以千计的工人行动起来，到火车站和居民区散发传单，揭露美日反动派的罪恶行径。一些工人还冲到“化工厂”的厂长住处，表示抗议。
    美帝国主义的忠实走狗佐藤政府悍然出动武装警察和便衣特务镇压工人的抗议斗争。但是，敌人的镇压，更加激起了日本工人的强烈反抗。
    一位积极参加斗争的活动家户仓说，我们坚决反对美帝国主义侵略越南，反对佐藤反动政府为美帝侵越战争效劳。我们的反美爱国斗争是正义的。毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”我们日本工人就是根据毛主席的这一教导，同美日反动派进行坚决斗争的。
　　不怕威胁打击，坚持反修斗争
    大阪一位出租汽车司机松本一直坚持学习毛主席语录。他说，毛主席的伟大教导，使我看清了谁是真革命，谁是假革命。他不怕日修分子的威胁和打击，坚持学习和宣传毛泽东思想。
    松本还积极地把宣传毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命的报刊分发给伙伴们，有时还把这些报纸张贴在工作场所的墙壁上，向群众宣传。
    对于战无不胜的毛泽东思想怕得要死、恨得要命的日共宫本修正主义集团，使用了威胁、殴打等种种卑鄙手段，企图阻止松本这一革命行动。但是，松本牢记毛主席的伟大教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他毫不动摇，对日本修正主义分子的阴谋活动进行了坚决的反击。
    有一次，松本和他的伙伴在一百多人参加的集会上列举日修分子在羽田机场、佐世保港以及千叶县的三里塚等地的一系列反美斗争中背叛人民的大量事实，揭露了宫本集团的丑恶面目，使日修分子哑口无言，狼狈不堪。
    松本怀着对毛主席的深厚感情对中国记者说，毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大领袖。毛主席创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义发展到当代的最高水平。
    松本说，毛主席的话，句句是真理。毛主席的教导增强了日本人民对于未来的希望和信心。我确信，只要日本人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持毛主席指出的“枪杆子里面出政权”的伟大真理，日本革命就一定会取得胜利。
