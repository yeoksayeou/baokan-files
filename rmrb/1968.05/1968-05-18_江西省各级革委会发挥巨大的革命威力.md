The revolutionary committees, which combine revolutionary cadres, military representatives, and revolutionary masses, are more in line with the needs of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The revolutionary committees of Jiangxi Province are exerting tremendous revolutionary power.

The revolutionary committees, under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are vigorously carrying out class struggle, mobilizing the vast revolutionary army, and launching fierce attacks on the handful of die-hard capitalist-roaders within the Party, the traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the Party, as well as the ghosts and snakes in society.

New China News Agency, Nanchang, May 15—Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, revolutionary committees have been established at various levels in Jiangxi Province. Following the establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee, six prefectures, two cities, and more than 80% of the counties in the province have established revolutionary committees. Revolutionary committees at the grassroots level are widespread, covering both urban and rural areas. These revolutionary committees are playing an increasingly important role in leading the broad revolutionary masses to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The heroic sons and daughters of Jinggangshan praise: "The revolutionary committee is good, very good!"

A year ago, when the revolutionary committee, this new thing, appeared, the great leader Chairman Mao, with his great talent as a proletarian revolutionary, foresaw far into the future and pointed out: "In places and units where power needs to be seized, the revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' policy must be implemented to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat. The name of this power organ is best called the revolutionary committee." The emergence of revolutionary committees at various levels in Jiangxi Province is a great victory achieved by the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat in their struggle to seize power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, under the illumination of Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions. It is an important sign of the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "The basic experience of the revolutionary committee has three points: one is the representative of revolutionary cadres, one is the representative of the army, and one is the representative of the revolutionary masses, achieving the revolutionary 'three-in-one combination.' The revolutionary committee should implement unified leadership, break down redundant administrative organs, streamline personnel, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions most perfectly, scientifically, and profoundly summarize the experience of the revolutionary committee, pointing out the fundamental direction for the construction of the revolutionary committee. Revolutionary cadres, representatives of the People's Liberation Army, and representatives of the revolutionary masses participating in various levels of revolutionary committees in Jiangxi Province, as well as the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat, have seriously studied Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions and are now, with the highest enthusiasm and greatest efforts, building the revolutionary committee into a revolutionary command center that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and connected with the masses.

After the establishment of revolutionary committees at various levels in Jiangxi Province, they have taken loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as their highest requirement; they have taken studying, implementing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's instructions as their most sacred duty; they have placed the study and application of great Mao Zedong Thought in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything. Under the leadership of revolutionary committees at various levels, the entire province has launched an unprecedented large-scale movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. During the spring plowing period, revolutionary committees at the provincial, prefecture, county, and commune levels organized nearly 200,000 people to form an "agricultural support" army to go deep into the countryside to propagate Mao Zedong Thought; at the same time, they organized a batch of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go deep into factories, mines, schools, and other grassroots units to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought classes are springing up and flourishing in cities and countryside across the province. According to incomplete statistics, the province has held more than 210,000 Mao Zedong Thought classes, with over 16 million participants. Mao Zedong Thought has never been so widely spread as it is today, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions are increasingly deeply rooted in people's hearts. The proletarian consciousness and the consciousness of the struggle between the two lines of the broad revolutionary masses have been greatly enhanced, and revolutionary spirit has been greatly promoted. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has promoted production, and the industrial production of the entire province is booming, with output, quantity, and quality increasing month by month; agricultural production is thriving, and the spring plowing production has also achieved a great victory.

The revolutionary committees at various levels in Jiangxi Province, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are vigorously carrying out class struggle, mobilizing the vast revolutionary army, and launching fierce attacks on the handful of die-hard capitalist-roaders within the Party, the traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the Party, and the class enemies in society. They take the class struggle as a practical action to be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and they emphasize the class struggle every day, every month, and every year. From the day it was born, the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee has taken the class struggle as a fundamental task. The first meeting of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee reviewed Chairman Mao's great teachings of "never forgetting class struggle." The first resolution of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee emphasized that it should take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline and vigorously carry out the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. In the fierce class struggle, the main leaders of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee have gone deep into the countryside, factories, mines, and schools to investigate the new trends and situations of the class struggle, mobilize the masses to further expose the class struggle, carry out revolutionary criticism, and launch attacks on the class enemies. Since the establishment of the revolutionary committees in Ganzhou and Fuzhou Prefectures, they have firmly grasped the direction of the revolutionary struggle, led the revolutionary masses to combine the class struggle in their own regions, and carried out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism. They resolutely opposed right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, smashed the class enemies' attempts to reverse the verdict, and severely struck at a handful of class enemies, further strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The revolutionary committees at various levels in Jiangxi Province, in order to better lead the revolutionary masses to fight against the class enemies, have seriously carried out education on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines for the revolutionary masses. They organized the revolutionary masses to study Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and methods on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and extensively carried out activities of recalling and comparing, recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness. The revolutionary committees at various levels from county to commune in Yichun Prefecture, through holding Mao Zedong Thought classes, reporting meetings, bitter struggle meetings, and class struggle exhibitions, carried out extensive class education and education on the struggle between the two lines, enhancing the class struggle consciousness of the broad workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres, and quickly launched a vigorous revolutionary upsurge of criticizing China's Khrushchev and severely striking at the sabotage activities of a handful of class enemies. Many regions and grassroots units' revolutionary committees extensively mobilized the masses to carry out activities of recalling the bitterness of the old society and the hatred of the nation, recalling the suffering and poisoning of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, investigating the sabotage activities of capitalist-roaders, traitors, spies, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and rightists, further enhancing the class struggle and the consciousness of the struggle between the two lines of the broad revolutionary masses. The broad revolutionary masses unite against the enemy, directing the struggle spearhead firmly at a handful of class enemies.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently deeply taught us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its leadership and the broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The revolutionary committees at various levels in Jiangxi Province are seriously studying and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great instructions, and are now, taking advantage of the good situation, further mobilizing the masses to launch even more fierce attacks on the class enemies, determined to thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev and other handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, fight them down and make them stink, thoroughly eliminate their revisionist poison, and dig out all the hidden traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries. The revolutionary committees at various levels in Jinggangshan Prefecture have mobilized the masses to set up revolutionary criticism battlefields everywhere. The broad revolutionary masses, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their weapons, dig out China's Khrushchev, this poisonous root, and dig out the traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, severely striking at a handful of class enemies. Many factories, enterprises, and grassroots units in Nanchang City have fully mobilized the masses to carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism, digging out the hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries one by one, and carrying out criticism and struggle against these class enemies.

The revolutionary committees at various levels in Jiangxi Province, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are vigorously carrying out the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and at the same time, in all their work, they maintain and carry forward the hardworking and self-reliant qualities of the working people and the fine tradition of our Party's close connection with the masses, winning the sincere love and firm support of the broad revolutionary masses. They excitedly say: "Chairman Mao loves us, and we love him. Chairman Mao supports us, and we support him. The revolutionary committee is a proletarian revolutionary power established in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. We must cherish it, support it, and help it to be continuously consolidated and developed."

    革命干部代表、军队代表、革命群众代表三结合的权力机构更加适应无产阶级专政的需要
    江西省各级革委会发挥巨大的革命威力
    革委会高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓阶级斗争，调动浩浩荡荡的革命大军，主动地、不停顿地向党内一小撮死不悔改的走资派和混进党内的叛徒、特务、反革命分子以及社会上的牛鬼蛇神，展开了猛烈进攻
    新华社南昌十五日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，江西省各级革命委员会纷纷建立起来。现在，继省革命委员会成立之后，全省六个专区、两个市和百分之八十以上的县都成立了革命委员会，基层单位的革命委员会更是星罗棋布，遍布城乡。各级革命委员会在带领广大革命群众夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，正日益显示出强大的生命力。英雄的井冈山儿女赞扬说：“革命委员会就是好，好得很！”
    一年前，当革命委员会这个新生事物出现的时候，伟大领袖毛主席就以他无产阶级革命家的伟大天才，高瞻远瞩地指出：“在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的‘三结合’的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。这个权力机构的名称，叫革命委员会好。”江西省各级革命委员会联翩出现，就是在毛主席这一光辉指示的照耀下，广大无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资派开展夺权斗争所取得的伟大胜利，是两年来无产阶级文化大革命运动取得伟大胜利的一个重要标志。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近又指出：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”毛主席的这一光辉指示，最完善、最科学、最精辟地总结了革命委员会的经验，为革命委员会的建设指出了根本的方向。江西省参加各级革命委员会的革命干部的代表、人民解放军的代表和革命群众的代表，以及广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，认真学习了毛主席的这一光辉指示，正以最高的热情，最大的努力，把革命委员会建设成为无限忠于毛主席的革命化的联系群众的战斗指挥部。
    江西省各级革命委员会成立以后，把忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，作为对自己的最高要求；把学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席的指示，作为自己最神圣的职责；把活学活用伟大的毛泽东思想，摆在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的位置。在各级革命委员会的领导下，全省掀起了空前规模的活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动。在春耕期间，省、专区、县、公社各级革命委员会组织了近二十万人参加的“支农”大军深入农村宣传毛泽东思想；同时，组织了一批毛泽东思想宣传队深入工厂、矿山、学校和其他基层单位，宣传毛泽东思想。全省城乡各地，毛泽东思想学习班越办越多，越办越好。据不完全统计，全省已经办了二十一万多期学习班，参加学习的达一千六百多万人次。毛泽东思想从来没有象今天这样大普及，毛主席的最新指示越来越深入人心。广大革命群众的无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，革命精神大大发扬。无产阶级文化大革命推动了生产，全省工业生产蒸蒸日上，产值、产量和质量一月超过一月；农业生产欣欣向荣，春耕生产也打了个大胜仗。
    江西省各级革命委员会高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓阶级斗争，调动浩浩荡荡的革命大军，主动地、不停顿地向党内一小撮死不悔改的走资派，向混进党内的叛徒、特务、反革命分子和社会上的阶级敌人，展开了猛烈的进攻。他们把狠抓阶级斗争作为忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的实际行动，对阶级斗争决心要天天讲，月月讲，年年讲，天天抓，月月抓，年年抓。江西省革命委员会从诞生第一天起，便把抓好阶级斗争作为一项根本的任务。省革命委员会的第一次会议，就重温了毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导。省革命委员会的第一个决议，就强调要以毛主席最新指示为纲，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争。在激烈的阶级斗争中，省革命委员会的主要领导成员，都深入农村、工厂、矿山、学校，调查阶级斗争的新动向、新情况，发动群众进一步揭阶级斗争的盖子，开展革命的大批判，主动向阶级敌人进攻。赣州、抚州等专区革命委员会成立以来，紧紧掌握革命斗争的大方向，带领革命群众结合本地区的阶级斗争实际，深入持久地开展革命大批判，坚决反对右倾机会主义，右倾分裂主义，右倾投降主义，粉碎阶级敌人的翻案妖风，狠狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人，进一步加强了无产阶级专政。
    江西省各级革命委员会为了更好地率领革命群众向阶级敌人进行斗争，认真地向革命群众进行了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的教育。他们组织革命群众学习了毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，并且广泛开展了回忆对比、忆苦思甜的活动。宜春专区从县到公社各级革命委员会，通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，讲用会，诉苦会，阶级斗争展览会等各种形式，大搞阶级教育和两条路线斗争教育，使广大工人、贫下中农和革命干部增强了阶级斗争观念，全区迅速掀起一个狠批中国赫鲁晓夫，狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人破坏活动的轰轰烈烈的革命热潮。许多地区和基层单位的革命委员会，广泛发动群众开展了忆旧社会的阶级苦、民族恨，忆受资产阶级反动路线的迫害和毒害的苦，查走资派、查叛徒特务、查地富反坏右的破坏活动，更加增强了广大革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。广大革命群众团结对敌，把斗争矛头紧紧对准一小撮阶级敌人。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”江西省各级革命委员会认真学习并坚决贯彻毛主席的这一伟大指示，目前正趁大好形势，进一步发动群众，更猛烈地向阶级敌人发动进攻，决心把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派批深批透，斗倒斗臭，彻底肃清他们的修正主义流毒，把隐藏的叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子统统挖出来。井冈山专区各级革命委员会放手发动群众，处处摆开了革命大批判的战场。广大革命群众以毛主席的最新指示为武器，上挖中国赫鲁晓夫这条毒根，下挖混进革命队伍的叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子，狠狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。南昌市许多工厂、企业基层单位的革命委员会充分发动群众，深入开展革命大批判，把隐藏的叛徒、特务和反革命分子一个个地揪了出来，对这些阶级敌人进行了批判和斗争。
    江西省各级革命委员会高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，同时在各项工作中保持和发扬劳动人民艰苦奋斗的品质和我党密切联系群众的优良传统，得到了广大革命群众的衷心爱戴和坚决支持。他们激动地说：“毛主席热爱我们热爱，毛主席支持我们支持。革命委员会是遵照毛主席指示建立起来的无产阶级革命政权，我们一定要爱护它，支持它，帮助它不断地巩固和发展。”
