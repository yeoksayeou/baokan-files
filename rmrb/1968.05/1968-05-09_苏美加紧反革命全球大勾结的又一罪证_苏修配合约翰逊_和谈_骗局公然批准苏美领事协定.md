In the midst of the Soviet and American intensification of global counter-revolutionary collusion, the Soviet revisionist leading clique on May 4 publicly announced the approval of the long-delayed Soviet-American consular agreement, eagerly creating an atmosphere of Soviet-American "cooperation."

The Soviet-American consular agreement was signed in Moscow in June 1964 by the governments of the two countries. This agreement stipulates that if the Soviet government arrests an American in the Soviet Union, it must notify the American side within three days and must allow the American side to contact the arrested American criminal within four days. The agreement also stipulates that after the agreement comes into effect, the governments of the Soviet Union and the United States can mutually establish consulates in cities other than each other's capitals.

The signing of this agreement is a product of the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique's pursuit of Soviet-American "cooperation" and global collusion, which was highly praised by the American imperialist head Johnson at the time, who said it was a "significant step" in the ongoing efforts to increase "contact and understanding" between the two countries. When the U.S. Congress approved this agreement, American officials and newspapers unanimously applauded, saying, "This is a step that costs very little but is very beneficial to national interests," and that the action of approving this agreement "during the Vietnam War" "has importance beyond the content of the agreement."

After signing the Soviet-American consular agreement, the Soviet revisionist leading clique, in order to cover up their traitorous face of flattering, surrendering to, and colluding with the Americans, deliberately put this agreement on hold for several years. They hesitantly spread the word that it was impossible for them to approve this agreement while the United States continued to bomb North Vietnam. However, just as Johnson was intensifying his "peace talks" deception, they hurriedly passed this agreement through the Soviet Supreme Soviet, giving a boost to the Washington ruling clique. The Agence France-Presse correspondent in Moscow reported on May 4 that this was an "indirect encouragement" from Moscow to "Washington, which is intensifying its deception and intrigue." According to a UPI report, the incoming U.S. representative to the United Nations, Ball, said on May 5 in a national television program in response to a reporter's question that at this time, the Soviet government's announcement of the approval of the Soviet-American consular agreement, "I think this is beneficial."

To further strengthen Soviet-American "cooperation" under these circumstances, the Soviet revisionist clique, with the ink of the approved Soviet-American consular agreement barely dry, exchanged diplomatic notes with the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union on May 6 to amend the aviation agreement signed between the two countries more than a year ago, so that this delayed agreement can be implemented. According to reports, the Moscow-New York route decided by this agreement may begin operation at the end of June.

The leaders of the Soviet revisionist clique have in the past deceived themselves and others by claiming that as long as the Vietnam War continues, it is impossible for Soviet-American relations to "improve" further. Their false support for the Vietnamese people has long been exposed by countless facts. Their recent approval of the Soviet-American consular agreement, amendment of the Soviet-American aviation agreement, and other facts have only further torn off their masks, exposing their shameful traitorous faces.

### 苏美加紧反革命全球大勾结的又一罪证　苏修配合约翰逊“和谈”骗局公然批准苏美领事协定

　　苏美加紧反革命全球大勾结的又一罪证
　　苏修配合约翰逊“和谈”骗局公然批准苏美领事协定
    新华社八日讯　在美苏加紧反革命全球大勾结的时候，苏修领导集团于五月四日公然宣布批准了它搁置多年的苏美领事协定，竭力制造苏美“合作”气氛。
    苏美领事协定是苏美两国政府在一九六四年六月在莫斯科签订的。这个协定规定，苏联政府如果逮捕了在苏联的美国人，必须在三天以内通知美国方面，并必须在四天以内让美国方面同被捕的美国罪犯进行接触。协定还规定，在协定生效后，苏美两国政府可以互相在对方首都以外的一些城市开设领事馆。
    这个协定的签订是勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团追求苏美“合作”和全球大勾结的一个产物，当时曾受到美帝头子约翰逊的大加赞赏，说它是为了增进美苏两国的“接触和了解所不断作出的努力中的一个具有重大意义的步骤”。在美国国会批准了这个协定的时候，美国官方和报刊一致叫好，认为“这是一个所花代价很小而却非常有利于国家利益的步骤”，“在越南战争进行当中”批准这个协定的行动，“具有超乎协定内容的重要性”。
    在签订苏美领事协定以后，苏修领导集团为了掩饰自己媚美、降美、联美的叛徒面目，曾故作姿态，把这个协定搁置了几年。他们忸忸怩怩地散布空气说，在美国继续轰炸越南北方的情况下，要他们批准这个协定是不可能的。可是，正当约翰逊加紧玩弄“和谈”骗局的时候，他们却急忙通过苏联最高苏维埃批准了这个协定，给华盛顿统治集团打气。法新社驻莫斯科记者四日在报道中就指出，这是莫斯科对正在加紧推行骗和阴谋的“华盛顿的一种间接的鼓励”。据美新处报道，即将上任的美国驻联合国代表鲍尔五日在全国电视节目中回答记者的问题时说，在目前这个时候，苏联政府宣布批准苏美领事协定，“我认为这是有益的”。
    为了在这种情况下进一步加强苏美“合作”，苏修集团批准的苏美领事协定墨迹未干，五月六日，苏联外交部和美国驻苏联大使馆又交换了外交照会，就两国一年多前签订的航空协定作了修改，以便使搁置下来的这个协定付诸实现。据报道，这个协定决定开辟的莫斯科—纽约航线可能在六月底开始使用。
    苏修集团的头目们，过去曾自欺欺人地声称，只要在越南战争继续进行的情况下，苏美两国之间的关系是不可能进一步“改善”的。他们这种对越南人民的假支持，早已被无数事实所戳穿。最近他们批准苏美领事协定、修改苏美航空协定等事实，只不过进一步撕破了他们的画皮，暴露了他们可耻的叛徒嘴脸。
