The Spring Trade Fair of Chinese Export Commodities concluded successfully in Guangzhou today. This unprecedentedly grand trade fair showcased the abundant political and economic achievements of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years, reflecting the thriving and prosperous scene of our great socialist motherland under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

	This trade fair, held during the stage of comprehensive victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has consistently presented a prosperous and flourishing scene. The number of trade professionals from five continents participating in this fair was the highest in history, and the number of countries and regions represented was also greater than before. Countries such as Congo (Brazzaville), Mali, Sudan, Somalia, and Nepal sent trade delegations or representatives from state-owned companies to participate in the fair. Many trade professionals reflected that they were so eager to participate in the Chinese Export Commodities Trade Fair for two main reasons: first, because the world has entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as its great banner, and China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been ongoing for two years, they wanted to see with their own eyes the great achievements of the Chinese people in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and carrying out this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; second, because the capitalist world is currently facing a serious economic crisis, they need to find new avenues in trade. Many foreign friends, upon seeing the various rich products China offers for export at the trade fair, expressed that they realized the Chinese working class and commune farmers, who have been inspired with sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are indeed building a more prosperous and powerful socialist China. They confidently saw that there are even broader prospects for trade with China.

	At this trade fair, China's foreign trade sector, as always, adhered to the policy of "equality and mutual benefit, mutual exchange of needs" and the principle of "honoring contracts and keeping promises." They signed a large number of trade contracts with trade professionals from five continents, and the total value of export and import trade exceeded the original plan for this trade fair. Many trade professionals from the capitalist world, where the economic crisis is severe, came to Guangzhou and saw with their own eyes the development of China's production, currency stability, and the continuous improvement of people's living standards. They deeply felt that trading with China is the most reliable option, so they eagerly negotiated and actively concluded deals. Many trade professionals would arrive early in the morning to wait in the negotiation rooms, a rare sight at previous trade fairs.

	Foreign guests, through participating in the trade fair, deepened their understanding of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction. Two Japanese friends expressed their deep feelings to a reporter, saying that last autumn's trade fair coincided with the devaluation of the British pound, and this spring's trade fair coincided with the dollar crisis. From the devaluation of the British pound to the dollar crisis, it was only a few short months, and the Japanese economy was in chaos, with thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises going bankrupt every month. However, they participated in several Guangzhou trade fairs during China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and saw with their own eyes that the Chinese people, especially the working class, had grasped the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, turning spiritual strength into tremendous material strength, greatly promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production. They emphasized that during this period from the devaluation of the British pound to the dollar crisis, China became even more prosperous. All this confirms Chairman Mao's wise judgment that "the East Wind prevails over the West Wind."

	Over the past month, the trade fair also received more than 6,000 overseas Chinese, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, and foreign diplomats, sailors, and other international friends passing through Guangzhou for a visit. They all praised the achievements of this trade fair. Albanian Ambassador to China Nataneli wrote in the guest book after visiting the trade fair that the exhibits at the Chinese trade fair are of high quality, diverse in variety, and showcase the ingenuity and creativity of the great Chinese people through exquisite modern technology. The Chinese people, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's invincible red banner, are resolutely implementing the instructions of "grasp revolution, promote production" and have achieved brilliant results in all aspects.

	This evening, the Spring Trade Fair of Chinese Export Commodities held a closing reception. Attendees included trade friends from five continents and trade fair staff. Chen Yu, the director of the trade fair, and Jia Shi, the deputy director and vice minister of China's Ministry of Foreign Trade, spoke at the reception. They unanimously pointed out that the prosperous scene of this trade fair is in stark contrast to the deteriorating political and economic crises currently appearing in the capitalist world, once again eloquently proving the wise judgment of our great leader Chairman Mao: "The enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day." They emphasized that the successful conclusion of the trade fair is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The success of the trade fair thoroughly refuted the slanders and lies spread by imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries from various countries against China. They expressed that the Chinese people will, as always, develop trade relations with friendly trade professionals from all over the world.

    显示了无产阶级文化大革命在政治经济上取得的丰硕成果
    中国春季出口商品交易会胜利闭幕
    来自五大洲的贸易界人士，亲眼看到中国亿万人民、特别是工人阶级，掌握了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，把精神力量化为巨大的物质力量，大大促进了工农业生产的发展。这同目前资本主义世界出现的日益恶化的政治经济危机，恰成鲜明的对比。交易会的胜利，彻底粉碎了帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派对中国的造谣诬蔑
    新华社广州十五日电　一九六八年春季中国出口商品交易会今天在广州闭幕。这次盛况空前的交易会，显示了两年来的我国无产阶级文化大革命在政治、经济方面的丰硕成果，反映了我们伟大社会主义祖国在毛泽东思想指引下蒸蒸日上的一派繁荣富强的景象。
    在我国无产阶级文化大革命进入全面胜利的阶段举办的这届交易会，始终呈现一片欣欣向荣的景象。参加交易会的来自五大洲的贸易界人士比以往任何一届都多，国家和地区也比以前扩大。刚果（布）、马里、苏丹、索马里、尼泊尔等亚非国家，还派出贸易代表团或国营公司的代表前来参加交易会。许多贸易界人士反映，他们所以这样踊跃参加中国出口商品交易会，一方面是由于当前世界进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代，中国开展无产阶级文化大革命已经两年，他们要亲眼看看中国人民活学活用毛主席著作和开展这场无产阶级文化大革命取得的伟大成就；另一方面是由于当前资本主义世界面临着严重的经济危机，他们在贸易方面需要寻找新的出路。许多外国朋友在交易会上看到我国提供出口的各种丰富的产品后表示，他们认识到在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出冲天革命干劲的我国工人阶级和公社农民，的确正在把伟大的社会主义中国建设得更加繁荣富强。他们满怀信心地看到同中国进行贸易有着更加广阔的前景。
    在这次交易会上，我国对外贸易部门一如既往地贯彻“平等互利，互通有无”的政策和“重合同，守信用”的原则，同来自五大洲的贸易界人士签订了大量的贸易合同，成交的出口和进口贸易总额，大大超过了这届交易会的原定计划。许多从经济危机严重的资本主义世界来到广州的贸易界人士，亲眼看到我国生产发展、货币稳定、人民生活水平日益提高的情况，深深感到同中国进行贸易最可靠，因此踊跃洽谈，积极成交。许多贸易界人士每天一早就守候在洽谈间里等待洽谈，这是历届交易会上少见的情况。
    各国来宾通过参加交易会，加深了对我国无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义建设的了解。两位日本朋友非常感慨地对记者说，去年秋季交易会恰逢英镑贬值，今年春季交易会又逢美元危机。从英镑贬值到美元危机，只不过短短几个月的时间，日本经济界一片混乱，每月都有大批中小企业倒闭。但是，他们在中国无产阶级文化大革命期间接连参加了几次广州交易会，亲眼看到中国亿万人民，特别是工人阶级，掌握了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，把精神力量化为巨大的物质力量，大大促进了工农业生产的发展。他们强调指出，从英镑贬值到美元危机的这一时期，中国是更加繁荣了。这一切证实了毛主席关于“东风压倒西风”的英明论断。
    一个月来，交易会还接待了六千多名华侨、港澳同胞和路过广州的外交使节、外国海员及其他国际友人前来参观。他们普遍赞扬这次交易会取得的成就。阿尔巴尼亚驻我国大使纳塔奈利参观交易会后在留言簿上写道，中国交易会展出的展品，质量高，品种多，精湛的现代技术，向全世界人民表明伟大的中国人民的创造力和天才。中国人民高举伟大领袖毛主席战无不胜的思想红旗，坚决贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的指示，在各方面都取得了辉煌的成就。
    今晚，中国出口商品交易会举行闭幕招待会。出席招待会的有来自五大洲的贸易界朋友和交易会工作人员。交易会主任委员陈郁和副主任委员、我国对外贸易部副部长贾石在酒会上致词。他们一致指出，这届交易会的兴旺景象，同目前资本主义世界出现的日益恶化的政治危机和经济危机，恰成鲜明的对比，再一次雄辩地证明了我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明论断：
  “敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”。他们强调指出，交易会的圆满成功，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。交易会的胜利，彻底粉碎了帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派对我国的造谣诬蔑。他们表示，中国人民将一如既往地同世界上一切友好的贸易界人士发展贸易往来。
