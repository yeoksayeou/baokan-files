The reactionary film "Storm Tide" has lyrics in every verse that sing the praises of Peng Dehuai, and every melody that summons his spirit.

The creators of the film shamelessly distort history, using the despicable method of deception to portray Peng Dehuai, a butcher who brutally suppressed the peasant movement, as a savior who "does not seek wealth or power," "beats up landlords and distributes grain," and "distributes land and fields." They beautify him as the leader of a "strong and powerful force," making the peasant movement "red all over the mountains south and north." What is even more intolerable is that the film compares this old counter-revolutionary to a "dragon that stirs up waves," a "three-foot-three" and "illuminates the four directions," a "sun" that warms the hearts of the poor. This is truly audacious and extremely arrogant!

Who is the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world? It is our beloved great leader Chairman Mao! It was he who personally initiated the peasant revolutionary movement that "sweeps like a storm, swift and extraordinary," and personally led the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people, overthrowing the three mountains of oppression on the Chinese people, and achieving great revolutionary victories. Peng Dehuai has never been more than a historical clown who opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

In 1959, at the Lushan Conference, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee exposed the anti-party conspirator and schemer Peng Dehuai, removed his position, and eliminated a hidden danger within the Party. However, the day the people rejoice is the day the reactionaries suffer. Peng Dehuai's followers, through the film "Storm Tide," maliciously portray Peng Dehuai's incarnation, Luo Dacheng, being "arbitrary and despotic" and "autocratic" by opportunists, singing a farewell song of "seeing you off to the side of the road, your kindness will never be forgotten, friends and villagers' hearts are bright, across mountains and waters, forever looking at each other," fully venting the affection for Peng Dehuai and hatred for the Party hidden in the hearts of these counter-revolutionaries.

This group of bats that fear sunlight also hint at the fable of a tiger learning to dance, directly aiming at Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. The creators of the film, in this song, dress up Peng Dehuai, who has always pursued an opportunistic line, as a "cat" who sheds blood for the revolution, sacrifices his head, and is "persecuted." What kind of cat is Peng Dehuai? He is a thorough counter-revolutionary! Before infiltrating the revolutionary ranks, he was a reactionary warlord suppressing the revolution; after infiltrating the revolutionary camp, he was a consistent anti-party schemer and conspirator. Our struggle with Peng Dehuai is a life-and-death struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "The struggle that took place at Lushan is a class struggle, a continuation of the life-and-death struggle between the two great opposing classes of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat in the past ten years of socialist revolution." Therefore, we must remove their positions and seize their power, and we must not be lenient; otherwise, once their counter-revolutionary ambitions are realized, capitalism will be restored, and the heads of countless revolutionary fighters will roll to the ground!

The enemy will not perish by itself. As long as they have a breath, they will struggle to the death. In 1962, the Chinese Khrushchev openly attacked Chairman Mao's criticism of Peng Dehuai, and Peng Dehuai, unwilling to be forgotten, threw out an eight-thousand-word book of rehabilitation. Peng Dehuai's followers, unable to suppress their excitement, in the reactionary film "Storm Tide," hope that Peng Dehuai and his ilk will revive their former glory of "killing enemies in the rain of bullets," "escape death," and continue their pirate ship in the wind and waves. They are ready to "wield spears" and make a big fuss.

However, all anti-party conspirators cannot escape revolutionary punishment. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated by Chairman Mao, the reactionary film "Storm Tide" and the counter-revolutionary restoration plots of its creators and their masters, the Chinese Khrushchev, Peng Dehuai, and their ilk, have been thoroughly exposed. Their counter-revolutionary pirate ship has also been destroyed. We proletarian revolutionaries must further carry forward the spirit of beating a fallen enemy, thoroughly criticize and expose them, and criticize them to the point of stench!

　　招魂的纸幡　反党的毒箭
　　于化
    反动影片《怒潮》的插曲，句句歌词为彭德怀歌功颂德，支支曲子为他抚“尸”招魂。
    影片的炮制者无耻地篡改历史，以偷天换日的卑劣手法，把彭德怀这个血腥镇压农民运动的刽子手，乔装打扮成“不为钱财不为官”、“专打土豪分粮仓”、“分地又分田”的救世主，美化成领导着“一支人马强又壮”的队伍，闹得“南山北山一片红”的农民运动的领袖。更使人不能容忍的是，影片还把这个老反革命比做翻江倒海的“一条龙”，喻为“三丈三”、“照四方”、温暖穷人心房的“太阳”。真是狗胆包天，狂妄之极！
    谁是世界人民心中的红太阳？是我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席！是他老人家亲自发动了“其势如暴风骤雨，迅猛异常”的农民革命运动，是他老人家亲自领导了中国人民的革命斗争，推翻了压在中国人民头上的三座大山，取得了革命的伟大胜利。而彭德怀从来不过是一个反对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的历史小丑！
    一九五九年在庐山会议上，毛主席和党中央揪出了反党大野心家、大阴谋家彭德怀，罢了他的官，撤了他的职，消灭了埋伏在党内一个隐患。但是，人民群众开心之日，正是反动派难受之时。彭德怀的死党则通过影片《怒潮》，别有用心地在银幕上表现彭德怀的化身罗大成被“专横跋扈”“独断专行”的机会主义者罢官的情节，唱出“送君送到大路旁，君的恩情永不忘，农友乡亲心里亮，隔山隔水永相望”的送别曲，把埋在这些反革命分子心底的那种对彭德怀的眷恋之情和对党的仇恨，发泄得淋漓尽致。
    这群害怕阳光的蝙蝠，还含沙射影地弹奏猛虎学道的寓言故事，锋芒直接指向毛主席和党中央。影片的炮制者在这支曲子里，把一贯推行机会主义路线的反党分子彭德怀，打扮成为革命洒热血、抛头颅而受“迫害”的“猫”。彭德怀是什么猫？他是地地道道的老反革命！在混进革命队伍前，他是镇压革命的反动军阀；钻入革命阵营后，他又是一贯反党的大野心家、大阴谋家。我们同彭德怀的斗争，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的殊死搏斗。正如毛主席所指出的：“庐山出现的这一场斗争，是一场阶级斗争，是过去十年社会主义革命过程中资产阶级与无产阶级两大对抗阶级的生死斗争的继续。”所以，对于彭德怀之流，我们就是要罢他们的官，夺他们的权，绝不可以手软，否则他们的反革命野心一旦得逞，资本主义就会复辟，无数革命战士的人头便会滚滚落地！
    敌人是不会自行灭亡的。他们只要还有一口气，就会进行垂死挣扎。一九六二年，中国赫鲁晓夫公开跳出来攻击毛主席对彭德怀的批判，彭德怀亦不甘寂寞，抛出了洋洋八万言的翻案书。彭德怀的死党抑止不住内心的激动，在反动影片《怒潮》中，希望彭德怀之流，重振当年所谓“枪林弹雨把敌杀”的威风，“死里逃生”，“风里浪里”继续行贼船。他们要“手执梭标”大干一场了。
    但是，一切反党的阴谋家绝不能逃脱革命的惩罚。在毛主席亲自发动的无产阶级文化大革命中，反动影片《怒潮》的炮制者和他们的主子中国赫鲁晓夫、彭德怀之流的反革命复辟的罪恶阴谋已经彻底破产了。他们的反革命贼船也覆灭了。我们无产阶级革命派一定要进一步发扬打落水狗的精神，把他们批深批透，批倒批臭！
