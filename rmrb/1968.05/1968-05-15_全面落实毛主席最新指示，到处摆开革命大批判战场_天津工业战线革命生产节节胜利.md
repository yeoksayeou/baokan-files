Fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, set up revolutionary criticism battlefields everywhere. The revolutionary production on the industrial front in Tianjin is achieving victory after victory.

The great mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong Thought is unprecedentedly surging forward. Revolutionary cadres and broad masses of workers are launching fierce attacks on class enemies. Revolution has promoted production development, and the total industrial output value of the whole city has risen sharply. In April, among 130 kinds of state-planned products, 70% of the products had a significant increase in output compared to March.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 14th: The proletarian revolutionary cadres and broad masses of workers on the industrial front in Tianjin, following the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, are fully implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, using revolution to promote production. The revolutionary and production situation on the industrial front in the whole city is unprecedentedly good.

The working class of Tianjin has summarized the current unprecedented good situation of "grasp revolution, promote production" in the whole city into the following aspects: The great mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong Thought is unprecedentedly surging forward, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is unprecedentedly popularized, Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions have deeply entered the hearts of the people. Broad masses of workers, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, are launching fierce attacks on class enemies. The great criticism has reached a new high tide. The counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of China's Khrushchev are being criticized more deeply. At the same time, each unit is fiercely criticizing and struggling against a handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders, exposing and smashing a handful of class enemies hidden in the industry, and smashing a handful of class enemies' plots to sabotage production, achieving unprecedented victories politically; In the great waves of class struggle, the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses have been unprecedentedly heightened; The revolutionary committees at all levels on the industrial front have been tempered and strengthened in the storms of class struggle, further establishing the revolutionary authority of the proletariat; The great leader Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" has become the conscious action of the broad revolutionary masses. Under the leadership of the revolution, the total industrial output value of the whole city has risen sharply, presenting a vibrant and prosperous scene. In April, among 130 kinds of state-planned products, 70% of the products had an increase in output compared to March. Among them, the output of steel, metal-cutting machine tools, chemical pesticides, bicycles, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and knitted products has increased significantly.

The "Sixteen Articles" personally presided over by Chairman Mao point out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces in our country." "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is for the purpose of making people's ideology revolutionary, so that all work can be done better, faster, more, and more economically." In the two years of struggle practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the working class of Tianjin has had a deeper understanding of the great significance of Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and has more consciously implemented this great policy. Broad revolutionary masses say, "Grasp revolution," the key is in the "grasp"; "Promote production," the key is in the "promote." "Grasp" and "promote," the key is the revolutionization of people's ideology, leading the revolution to promote the development of production. In the process of grasping revolution and promoting production, the broad revolutionary masses of Tianjin first grasp the line of class struggle and two-line struggle, strongly emphasizing proletarian politics. They use the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle as a powerful ideological weapon, setting up revolutionary criticism battlefields everywhere, launching a magnificent "people's war," and launching a comprehensive attack on China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and their agents in Tianjin. They criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods they advocate, such as the theory of "extinction of class struggle," "production first," "technology first," and "expert path," making them stink to high heaven. They also expose the traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries hidden on the industrial front and smash the plots of a handful of class enemies to sabotage production and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, further developing the good situation. Some textile factories and enterprises in Tianjin's textile industry, through the fierce struggle against class struggle and two-line struggle, have unprecedentedly heightened the class consciousness of revolutionary cadres, releasing boundless revolutionary enthusiasm and infinite wisdom, creating outstanding production achievements, and presenting an unprecedentedly good situation throughout the textile industry. The Second Cotton Textile Factory in Tianjin, through the fierce struggle against class struggle, launched a revolutionary great criticism, making the political atmosphere thick, the broad revolutionary cadres full of fighting spirit and vigor, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and deep hatred for China's Khrushchev and a handful of class enemies. Such a revolutionary army has the most vigorous fighting force, invincible and unstoppable. No matter how deeply a handful of class enemies hide, they are dug out by revolutionary cadres; no matter how the class enemies play tricks, trying to sabotage production and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they are smashed by revolutionary cadres; no matter what difficulties arise in production, they are overcome by revolutionary cadres. Now the output of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in this factory has risen sharply, the revolution is booming, and production is thriving.

After achieving great victories in revolution and production on the industrial front in Tianjin, early May, a mobilization meeting was held to further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and launch a new high tide of "grasp revolution, promote production." The broad revolutionary masses in the whole city are determined to achieve greater results in grasping revolution and promoting production and to seize comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.

    全面落实毛主席最新指示，到处摆开革命大批判战场
    天津工业战线革命生产节节胜利
    活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动空前高涨，广大革命职工向阶级敌人主动地发起猛烈进攻。革命促进了生产的发展，全市工业总产值大幅度上升。四月份，一百三十种国家计划产品中，有百分之七十的产品的产量比三月份有较大的增长
    据新华社天津十四日电　天津市工业战线的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，以革命带动生产，全市工业战线革命和生产形势空前大好。
    天津工人阶级把当前全市“抓革命，促生产”的空前大好形势，概括为以下几个方面：活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动空前高涨，战无不胜的毛泽东思想空前大普及，毛主席的一系列最新指示深入人心，广大职工怀着无限忠于毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，向阶级敌人主动地发起猛烈进攻，革命的大批判出现了新的高潮，中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义黑货正在受到更加深入的批判，同时各单位狠斗狠批一小撮死不悔改的走资派，挖出了隐藏的叛徒、特务和反革命分子，揭发和粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人破坏生产的阴谋，在政治上取得了空前大捷；在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，广大革命职工的无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，空前提高；工业战线上的各级革命委员会在阶级斗争的风浪中锻炼得更加巩固和坚强，进一步树立了无产阶级的革命权威；伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，变成广大革命职工的自觉行动，在革命的统帅下，全市工业总产值大幅度上升，出现了一片振奋人心的繁荣兴旺景象。四月份，一百三十种国家计划产品中，有百分之七十的产品的产量比三月份有所增长。其中钢材、金属切削机床、化学农药、自行车、棉纱、棉布、针织品的产量有了较大的增长。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的《十六条》指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”“无产阶级文化大革命，就是为的要使人的思想革命化，因而使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省。”在两年来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践中，天津的工人阶级更深刻地理解到毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的伟大意义，更自觉地贯彻执行毛主席的这一伟大方针。广大革命职工说，“抓革命”，贵在“抓”字上；“促生产”，贵在“促”字上。“抓”和“促”，关键是人的思想革命化，以革命带头，促进生产的发展。天津市广大革命职工在抓革命促生产中，首先抓住阶级斗争和两条路线斗争这一个纲，大力突出无产阶级政治。他们以伟大领袖毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导为强大思想武器，到处摆开革命大批判的战场，发起了声势浩大的“人民战争”，向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派及其在天津的代理人发动全面猛攻，把他们鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“生产第一”、“技术第一”、“专家路线”等反革命修正主义黑货批得臭不可闻，并且挖出了隐藏在工业战线的叛徒、特务和反革命分子，粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人妄图破坏生产、破坏文化大革命的阴谋，进一步发展了大好形势。天津纺织工业的一些工厂企业经过狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，革命职工的无产阶级觉悟空前提高，焕发出冲天的革命干劲和无穷的智慧，创造出优异的生产成绩，整个纺织工业战线出现了一派空前大好形势。天津第二棉纺织厂通过大抓阶级斗争，开展革命的大批判，全厂政治空气搞得浓浓的，广大革命职工斗志昂扬，朝气蓬勃，对伟大领袖毛主席怀着无限忠诚的无产阶级感情，对中国赫鲁晓夫等一小撮阶级敌人有着刻骨的仇恨。这样的一支革命大军，有最旺盛的战斗力，无坚不摧，无往不胜。不管一小撮阶级敌人隐蔽得多深，也被革命职工们挖了出来；不管阶级敌人怎样玩弄阴谋诡计，妄图破坏生产、破坏文化大革命，都遭到了革命职工的迎头痛击，被坚决粉碎；不管生产上出现什么困难，都被革命职工们一一克服。现在这个厂棉纱和棉布的产量大幅度上升，革命轰轰烈烈，生产热气腾腾。
    天津市工业战线在连续取得革命和生产的巨大胜利以后，五月初又召开了进一步落实毛主席的最新指示，掀起“抓革命，促生产”新高潮的动员大会。全市广大革命职工决心在抓革命促生产中做出更大的成绩，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
