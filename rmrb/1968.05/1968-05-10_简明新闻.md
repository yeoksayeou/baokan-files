	Iraqi intellectuals condemn U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam
	Nineteen Iraqi poets, writers, and journalists recently issued a joint appeal strongly condemning U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam.
	The appeal, in exposing the new tricks of U.S. imperialism, said that U.S. imperialism has suffered repeated humiliating defeats on the battlefield at the hands of the heroic Vietnamese people. Now, it is attempting to take certain measures to lure the Vietnamese people into relaxing their vigilance and slackening their fighting spirit.
	The appeal pointed out that the national liberation movements throughout the world are indivisible. The appeal also called on the Iraqi people to further support the struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people and condemn the crimes of U.S. imperialism in Vietnam.

	Other major companies under the control of the Tanzanian government include: Tanzania Metal Box Limited, British American Tobacco Tanzania Limited, Tanzania Breweries Limited, Kilimanjaro Breweries, Tanganyika Cement Limited, etc.
	It is reported that the Tanzanian government acquired the shares in these seven companies by providing compensation.
	Workers and farmers in nine provinces of western France go on strike
	Workers and farmers in nine provinces of western France went on a 24-hour strike on May 8 to protest against the intensified exploitation by monopoly capital, which has made their living conditions increasingly worse.
	This is the first time that workers and farmers in this region have united to struggle. They raised slogans such as "We want bread and work" and held large-scale protest rallies and demonstrations in many major cities. In some cities, demonstrators even threw stones at the offices of local authorities and fought with police who came to suppress them.
	Taxi drivers and postal workers in the French capital Paris also went on strike on May 7 and 8.
