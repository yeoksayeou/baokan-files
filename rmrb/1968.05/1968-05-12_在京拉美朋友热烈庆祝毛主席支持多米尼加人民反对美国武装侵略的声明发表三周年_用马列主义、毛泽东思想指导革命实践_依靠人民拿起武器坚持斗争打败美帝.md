In Beijing, Latin American friends are enthusiastically celebrating the third anniversary of Chairman Mao's statement supporting the Dominican people's resistance against U.S. armed invasion. Guided by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, they rely on the people to take up arms and fight relentlessly to defeat U.S. imperialism.

A Xinhua News Agency report dated May 11 states: May 12 marks the third anniversary of the publication of our great leader Chairman Mao's statement "Support the Dominican People's Resistance Against U.S. Armed Invasion." Latin American friends in Beijing spoke to our reporter, enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao's statement as a powerful weapon for oppressed peoples in their struggle against U.S. imperialism. They pointed out that people of all countries must use revolutionary violence to counter revolutionary violence to defeat the common enemy of the world's peoples, U.S. imperialism.

Leonardo Cruz, a Colombian friend, said that Chairman Mao's statement "Support the Dominican People's Resistance Against U.S. Armed Invasion" is a great encouragement to the Dominican people and the people of other Latin American countries in their struggle against U.S. imperialism. Chairman Mao's statement has shown us the correct path forward. In the statement, Chairman Mao pointed out: "As long as we rely on the broad masses of the people, unite all patriotic forces, and persist in a protracted struggle, the anti-American patriotic struggle in the Dominican Republic, with the support of the people of the whole world, is bound to achieve final victory." The development of anti-U.S. struggles across Latin America in recent years fully proves Chairman Mao's wise judgment.

He said that through their own struggles, the Latin American people have come to realize that U.S. imperialism is just a paper tiger. At the same time, they have also understood that to defeat the alliance of U.S. imperialists and domestic oppressors, they must have a revolutionary party based on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, as well as a people's army led by this party. They must organize a broad anti-U.S. united front and must learn from their own experiences to master Chairman Mao's brilliant strategy of encircling the cities from the countryside.

He said that the Latin American people are awakening and have recognized that a new enemy has also sided with the reactionaries. This enemy is modern revisionism, whose leader is the Soviet ruling clique. The Soviet revisionists have played the role of servants of U.S. imperialism and have further exposed their traitorous faces in front of the Latin American people.

Leonardo Cruz said that at present, the revolutionary forces in Latin America are organizing on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The flames of people's war against imperialism and feudalism are burning everywhere in Latin America. The struggles of the Latin American people are closely united with the struggles of the oppressed peoples and nations of Asia and Africa, and with the struggles of the proletariat in capitalist countries. They are advancing steadily and resolutely towards complete victory.

Brazilian friend Aragão said in his speech that Chairman Mao is the leader of the Chinese people and also the leader of the people of the world. Chairman Mao's love for the people has earned him high prestige among the people of the five continents. Mao Zedong Thought is the spiritual food of all revolutionaries. Chairman Mao's voice always clearly supports the oppressed in their struggle against tyranny, representing the broad masses of oppressed people. Chairman Mao's statement is a powerful weapon for the oppressed in their struggle against oppression.

Aragão said that U.S. imperialism's aggression has brought heavy disasters to the Latin American people. To deal with U.S. imperialism, there is only one way: to take up arms and give it a fatal blow. He said that the revolutionary people of the world have already recognized the importance of armed struggle. They are following Chairman Mao's teachings, using revolutionary violence to counter revolutionary violence, and fighting for their own liberation.

Peruvian friend A. Fernández said that Chairman Mao's statement "Support the Dominican People's Resistance Against U.S. Armed Invasion," issued three years ago, has complete practical significance for the development of the anti-U.S. struggle of the entire Latin American people. The Latin American people warmly welcome this statement and celebrate its third anniversary. He said that based on their own struggle experience, the Latin American people deeply understand that Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is an unshakable truth. The Latin American people understand that only by waging revolutionary struggle can the people of various countries achieve thorough liberation.

A. Fernández said that as long as they follow Chairman Mao's instructions in the statement "Support the Dominican People's Resistance Against U.S. Armed Invasion," that is, "as long as we rely on the broad masses of the people, unite all patriotic forces, and persist in a protracted struggle," the more than two hundred million Latin American people will surely achieve victory. Their struggle will make a great contribution to the struggle to bury the brutal imperialism led by the United States.

    在京拉美朋友热烈庆祝毛主席支持多米尼加人民反对美国武装侵略的声明发表三周年
    用马列主义、毛泽东思想指导革命实践
    依靠人民拿起武器坚持斗争打败美帝
    新华社十一日讯　五月十二日是我们伟大领袖毛主席《支持多米尼加人民反对美国武装侵略的声明》发表三周年。在北京的拉丁美洲朋友为此向本社记者发表谈话，热烈称颂毛主席的声明是被压迫人民同美帝国主义进行斗争的有力武器。他们指出，各国人民只有用革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力，才能打败世界人民的共同敌人美帝国主义。
    哥伦比亚朋友莱昂波多·克鲁斯说，毛主席《支持多米尼加人民反对美国武装侵略的声明》，是对多米尼加人民和拉丁美洲其他国家人民反对美帝国主义斗争的巨大鼓舞。毛主席声明给我们指出了前进的正确道路。毛主席在声明中指出：“只要依靠广大人民群众，团结一切爱国力量，坚持长期斗争，多米尼加的反美爱国斗争，在全世界人民的支持下，是一定能够取得最后胜利的。”最近几年拉丁美洲大陆反美斗争的发展，完全证明了毛主席的这一英明论断。
    他说，拉丁美洲人民在自己的斗争经历中认识到，美帝国主义只不过是一只纸老虎，同时他们也懂得了，要打败美帝国主义者和国内压迫者的反革命同盟，就必须有一个建立在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想基础上的革命党，以及这个党所领导的人民军队；就必须组织广泛的反美统一战线；就必须通过自身的经历掌握毛主席关于农村包围城市的英明战略。
    他说，拉丁美洲人民正在觉醒，认识到一个新的敌人也站在反革命一边。这个敌人就是现代修正主义，它的头子是苏联统治集团。苏修扮演了美帝的仆从角色，在拉丁美洲人民面前进一步暴露了它的叛徒嘴脸。
    莱昂波多·克鲁斯说，目前拉丁美洲的革命力量，正在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的基础上组织起来。拉丁美洲反帝反封建的人民战争的烈火到处燃烧。拉丁美洲人民的斗争，同亚洲、非洲被压迫人民和被压迫民族的斗争紧密联合在一起，同资本主义国家的无产阶级的斗争紧密联合在一起，正在坚定地突飞猛进，走向彻底的胜利。
    巴西朋友阿拉贡在谈话中说，毛主席是中国人民的领袖，也是全世界人民的领袖。毛主席对人民的热爱，使他在五大洲人民中享有崇高的威望。毛泽东思想是一切革命者的精神食粮。毛主席的声音，总是旗帜鲜明地支持被压迫者反对暴政，代表了广大被压迫人民。毛主席的声明，是被压迫者反对压迫的有力武器。
    阿拉贡说，美帝国主义的侵略，给拉丁美洲人民带来了沉重的灾难。对付美帝国主义，只有一个办法，那就是必须拿起武器，给它以致命的打击。他说，全世界革命人民已经认识到武装斗争的重要，他们正遵照毛主席的教导，以革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力，为自己的解放而斗争。
    秘鲁朋友阿·费尔南德斯说，毛主席在三年前发表的《支持多米尼加人民反对美国武装侵略的声明》，对整个拉丁美洲人民反美斗争的发展完全具有现实意义。拉丁美洲人民热烈欢迎这个声明，并庆祝这个声明发表三周年。他说，拉丁美洲人民根据自己的斗争经验深刻认识到，毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的英明论断是颠扑不破的真理。拉丁美洲人民懂得只有进行革命斗争，才是各国人民获得彻底解放的可靠道路。
    阿·费尔南德斯说，只要按照毛主席在《支持多米尼加人民反对美国武装侵略的声明》中所指出的，“只要依靠广大人民群众，团结一切爱国力量，坚持长期斗争”，两亿多拉丁美洲人民就一定会取得胜利。他们的斗争必将对埋葬以美国为首的残暴的帝国主义的斗争作出巨大贡献。
