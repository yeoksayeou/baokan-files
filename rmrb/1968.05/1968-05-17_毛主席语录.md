Without extensive people's democracy, the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be consolidated, and the government will be unstable. Without democracy, without mobilizing the masses, without the supervision of the masses, it is impossible to effectively exercise dictatorship over reactionaries and bad elements, nor is it possible to effectively reform them. They will continue to cause trouble, and there is the possibility of a comeback. This issue should be guarded against, and I hope comrades will give it some thought.

    毛主席语录
    没有广泛的人民民主，无产阶级专政不能巩固，政权会不稳。没有民主，没有把群众发动起来，没有群众的监督，就不可能对反动分子和坏分子实行有效的专政，也不可能对他们进行有效的改造，他们就会继续捣乱，还有复辟的可能。这个问题应当警惕，也希望同志们好好想一想。
