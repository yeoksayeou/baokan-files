South Vietnamese military and civilians have achieved new victories in continuous battles. In the southern part of Quang Nam Province, military and civilians fought for eleven days, annihilating nearly 700 enemy troops and shooting down 30 enemy aircraft. The people's armed forces have annihilated a large number of American and puppet troops in battles near Saigon and in the Xuan Loc area.

According to a report by the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, from May 5 to May 15, the military and civilians in the southern part of Quang Nam Province in South Vietnam engaged in continuous battles. They annihilated nearly 700 enemy troops, the majority of whom were American invaders. They also shot down 30 enemy aircraft, destroyed seven tanks and armored vehicles, eight artillery pieces, and burned down one fuel and ammunition depot each.

The report states that from May 5 to May 12, the people's liberation armed forces in the southern part of Quang Nam Province tightened their encirclement of the U.S. military stronghold at Hoang Son in Phu My County's Phu My Commune. While fiercely attacking the enemy stronghold, they bravely repelled the enemy's aerial attacks. In eight days, they shot down 21 enemy aircraft and killed 330 American soldiers.

From May 13 to May 15, the liberation army continuously intercepted enemy reinforcements attempting to relieve the Hoang Son stronghold, attacked the U.S. troops counterattacking the Yut Sau area, and assaulted three enemy strongholds near Hoang Son. They annihilated hundreds of enemy troops, shot down nine enemy aircraft, and destroyed six underground enemy shelters and four barracks.

According to a report by the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the people's liberation armed forces in South Vietnam have been continuously annihilating American and puppet troops in the Saigon area and the Xuan Loc battlefield, achieving new victories.

The report states that on the morning of May 13, the enemy launched a "sweep" in the new Tan Phu and new Tan Dinh areas on the outskirts of Saigon. The people's liberation armed forces in the Saigon-Gia Dinh area immediately counterattacked, annihilating a company of American troops invading Tan Phu. At the same time, in the battle to intercept a battalion of American troops entering Tan Dinh, they annihilated another company. That night, the people's liberation armed forces took advantage of the victory to attack the remaining enemy stronghold, annihilating them completely. Thus, the battalion of American troops invading Tan Dinh was completely annihilated.

On May 12, the people's liberation armed forces in the Saigon-Gia Dinh area, in a raid, annihilated a company of puppet marine troops and severely damaged the Saigon-Bien Hoa highway's Thao Dien Bridge.

In the early morning of May 18, the people's liberation armed forces in the northern part of Quang Tri Province attacked the enemy stronghold in the upper Van area near the 9th Highway, annihilating 40 American invaders.

On May 19, the people's liberation armed forces ambushed an enemy convoy south of Da, destroying one tank and annihilating a batch of enemy troops. The remaining enemy fled to the Da stronghold, and the people's liberation armed forces pursued and surrounded them. The enemy in the Da stronghold hastily dispatched two companies of troops and five tanks for relief. The people's liberation armed forces quickly surrounded the enemy and engaged in close combat, resulting in the annihilation of over 100 American troops and the destruction of three tanks.
