Our great leader Chairman Mao has said in his latest instructions: "In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots level to walk around and see for themselves. They should adhere to the mass line, consult the masses on all matters, and be students of the masses. In a certain sense, the most intelligent and most talented are those who have the most practical experience." Chairman Mao's teachings, I have studied over and over again, and the more I study, the more I feel close to them. Chairman Mao's teachings are an encouragement and a spur to me.

In the past, my relationship with the masses was not good. I studied Chairman Mao's works with this problem in mind. Chairman Mao teaches: "Many people think that the relationship between officers and soldiers, and between the military and the people, is not good because of wrong methods. I always tell them that it is a matter of fundamental attitude (or fundamental purpose). This attitude is to respect soldiers and respect the people."

Following Chairman Mao's teachings, I decided to go among the soldiers and to the actual struggle.

The company is a great crucible of revolution, a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Every time I go down to the company, I receive great education, and every time I can absorb new nourishment from the soldiers. One spring festival, I went to Kunlun Mountain and studied Chairman Mao's works with the soldiers, listened to the Central People's Broadcasting Station's programs together, and held a spring festival cultural evening. The soldiers' broad minds, heroic spirit, and proletarian feelings of boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao deeply moved me. In the harsh living environment, they live so vigorously and are full of revolutionary spirit. What power inspires them to be so tenacious? The soldiers answered well: it is Mao Zedong Thought that gives them boundless strength, and it is a heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao that enables them to overcome countless difficulties. The soldiers' firm will is precisely what I lack. I decided to learn from them and study Chairman Mao's works as diligently as they do, putting into practice what I learn, and working hard on the "use" aspect.

Our unit's location is scattered, and over the years, I have visited all the companies. In the process of going deep into the grassroots, I realized that just going to the company is not enough; I must truly blend in with the soldiers and establish proletarian class feelings with them.

Through multiple visits to the companies, I gradually managed to read Chairman Mao's works with the soldiers every day, engage in self-criticism and criticize revisionism together, share my thoughts with the soldiers, exercise together, work together, and eat together. Every time I go to a company, I first go to the soldiers' dormitories, mess halls, and command posts to see for myself, convey Chairman Mao's latest instructions and relevant instructions from higher authorities. Then I hold discussions with officers and soldiers, have heart-to-heart talks with them, ask them to share their experiences and insights from studying Chairman Mao's works, mainly to learn from them, summarize and propagate their experiences, listen to their various opinions, and help solve problems. I stand guard for the soldiers, help in the kitchen, etc.

My attitude towards the soldiers is thus transformed through one thing after another, one day after another, under the supervision and help of the soldiers. Through going down to the companies, my feelings with the soldiers have deepened, my official airs have been eliminated, bureaucratism has decreased, specific measures have increased, and my red heart loyal to Chairman Mao has been tempered even redder. I feel that the more I go down to the companies, the more I am transformed, the more I can maintain the character of an ordinary soldier.

Once, I went to the Gannan area and then transferred to the 12th Company to have a look. That night, the company held an emergency assembly. I thought, I can't be special just because I am a regiment commander, and I can't forgive myself just because I haven't rested well for a few days. Therefore, I still participated in the emergency assembly. The company commander shouted, "Run!" I ran with the soldiers against the wind; the company commander shouted, "Lie down!" I lay down with the soldiers in the snow. No matter how hard or tired it is, as long as I am with the soldiers, my heart is very comfortable. The next day I was about to leave, and this time I hadn't stood a shift yet. I can't not stand guard just because I am tired. That night, the wind and snow were quite strong, but which day here doesn't have wind and a bit of snow? Our soldiers stand guard all year round, enduring wind and snow. The more difficult it is, the more it tempers people, and the more one should go. So I still went to stand a shift. At that time, my feet were stepping on a piece of white snow on the high mountain, my hands were holding a gun given by Chairman Mao, and my mind was thinking of protecting our great leader Chairman Mao. I thought of Chairman Mao's affectionate instructions to "always maintain the spirit of hard struggle" and "never leave the masses for a moment." I thought, no matter how cold the weather is in the northwest, a heart loyal to Chairman Mao is forever burning hot; no matter how strong the wind and snow are on the plateau, the determination to defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line will never waver. I will stand guard for the iron-clad mountains of the proletariat and for the world revolution for life.

Another night, I stood guard in a certain unit. Within an hour, seven soldiers came to see me one after another. They were afraid I would catch a cold and insisted on replacing me. I was very moved and said, "I know your feelings, but if you don't want me to forget my roots, then let me stand guard. If you see any part of me that doesn't look like a sentry, point it out to me." I finally persuaded them one by one to go back. After getting off duty, I went to sleep, but that night, the soldiers who came to relieve me one by one came to cover me with a blanket and add coal to the stove. Although their movements were very light, because my mood was very excited, I didn't sleep at all, so I was very clear about each person coming. The soldiers' concern and care for me is such deep proletarian feelings! At that time, I was so moved that I shed tears. Every time I go down to the company, I receive an education, and my proletarian feelings loyal to Chairman Mao increase. Among the soldiers, the soldiers truly regard me as a class brother, as an ordinary soldier. Now, whenever I go to a company, many comrades come to talk to me, not saying "The regiment commander is here," but "The old soldier is here!" I really feel close. I do this in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions to "put down airs and be a student" and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions to "correctly treat oneself and correctly treat the masses." I think only in this way can I better promote the revolutionization of thought.

Through living with the soldiers in the company, eating and living together, and having heart-to-heart talks, I have come to know and understand the soldiers better. Living among the soldiers, I feel full of vigor and strong willpower, and I feel younger and younger.

In these years, I have gone deep into the companies and am willing to live with the soldiers. What force drives me to do this? It is the result of Chairman Mao's teachings. Whatever Chairman Mao says, I do it.

In the old society, my family had no house and no land. At the age of seven, I followed my father begging for food. At the age of eleven, I herded cattle for the landlord, living with cattle and horses all day, until I was fourteen. That year, Chairman Mao liberated me, and I joined the revolution, following Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin to participate in the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation. After the liberation of the country, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, I made new progress.

October 1, 1963, is a day I will never forget. On that day, I saw for the first time the great leader we yearn for day and night, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao. At that time, I was very excited and tears flowed down unconsciously. At that time, I swore: I will definitely follow Chairman Mao, definitely follow Chairman Mao to do revolution for life. Every time on May 1st and National Day, every time I know that Chairman Mao is going to meet with the Red Guards, my mood is particularly excited, and I always guard the post with the soldiers, vigilantly protecting the great leader Chairman Mao. Sometimes comrades want me to go eat, to rest, I think, Chairman Mao is still waving to the masses on Tiananmen! How can I go back to eat, how can I go to rest. Because I think of the great leader Chairman Mao in my heart, I don't feel hungry, I don't feel tired, and I am full of energy. I think, as a loyal soldier of Chairman Mao, being able to stand guard for Chairman Mao is the greatest happiness. I will always live among the masses, always be a student of the masses, always be an ordinary soldier, always stand guard and keep watch for Chairman Mao.

    永远做群众的小学生，永远当普通一兵
    兰州部队第三次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表兰州空军某部团长  纪顺忠
    伟大领袖毛主席在最新指示中说：“以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”毛主席的这个教导，我学了一遍又一遍，越学越感到亲切，毛主席的教导是对我的鼓励，对我的鞭策。
    过去，我和群众的关系搞得不太好。我带着这个问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席教导说：“很多人对于官兵关系、军民关系弄不好，以为是方法不对，我总告诉他们是根本态度（或根本宗旨）问题，这态度就是尊重士兵和尊重人民。”
    我遵照毛主席的教导，决心到战士中间去，到实际斗争中去。
    连队是革命的大熔炉，是毛泽东思想的大学校。每次下连，对我都有很大的教育，每次我都能从战士身上吸取新的养分。有一年春节，我到昆仑山上，和战士们一起学习毛主席著作，一起收听中央人民广播电台的节目，一起开春节文娱晚会。战士们广阔的胸怀，豪迈的气魄，对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的无产阶级感情，使我深受感动。在艰苦的生活环境里，他们生活得那么朝气蓬勃，充满了革命精神。是什么力量鼓舞着他们这样顽强呢？战士们回答得好，是毛泽东思想给了他们无穷无尽的力量，是一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，使他们克服了重重困难。战士们这种坚强的意志，恰恰是我不足的地方，我决心向他们学习，象他们那样刻苦学习毛主席著作，学了就用，在“用”字上狠下功夫。
    我们部队驻地分散，几年来，我跑遍了所有的连队。在深入基层的过程中，我体会到光是人到连队还不够，一定要跟战士真正打成一片，真正和战士建立起无产阶级的阶级感情。
    通过多次到连队锻炼，我渐渐做到了与战士一起天天读毛主席著作，一起斗私批修、向战士亮思想，一起出操，一起劳动，一起吃饭。每到一个连队，我首先要到战士宿舍、伙房和指挥所看一看，传达毛主席的最新指示和上级的有关指示精神。然后找干部、战士开座谈会，找他们谈心，请他们介绍学习毛主席著作的心得体会，主要是向他们学习，总结宣传他们的经验，听取他们的各种意见，帮助解决问题。替战士站岗，到伙房帮厨等。
    我对战士的态度，就是这样通过一件事一件事，一天一天地在战士的监督帮助下转变过来的。通过下连队，同战士的感情加深了，官架子打掉了，官僚主义减少了，具体办法增多了，忠于毛主席的红心炼得更红了。我觉得越下连队，越能得到改造，越能保持普通一兵的本色。
    一次，我去甘南一带，回来转到十二连去看看。当天晚上，连里搞紧急集合，我想，不能因为我是团长就特殊，不能因为几天没有休息好就原谅自己，因此，我还是参加了紧急集合。连长喊：“跑步走！”我跟战士一起顶着风跑；连长喊：“卧倒！”我跟战士一起爬在雪地里。再苦再累，只要跟战士在一起，我的心就很舒坦。第二天我就要走，这次来还没有站一班哨，不能因为累就不站。那天夜里风雪比较大，但是这里哪天不刮个风，飘点雪，我们的战士长年累月就是这样顶风冒雪站哨的啊！越是困难，越能锻炼人，越应当去，所以我还是去换了一班哨。当时，我脚下踩的是高山的一片白雪，手里握的是毛主席发给的一杆枪，心里想的是保卫我们伟大领袖毛主席。我想着毛主席“务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”和“一刻也不脱离群众”的亲切教导。我想，西北的天气再冷，忠于毛主席的一颗红心永远火热；高原的风雪再大，保卫毛主席、保卫毛泽东思想、保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的决心决不动摇。我要为无产阶级的铁打江山，为世界革命，放一辈子哨。
    又一个夜晚，我在某部站哨。一个小时先后就有七个战士来看我。他们怕我受冷，非要换我站岗。我心里很受感动，我说：“你们的心情我知道，但是如果你不想叫我忘本，那你就让我站岗。你看我哪个地方不象个哨兵的样子，就给我指出来。”总算一个个地说服回去了。下了岗，我就去睡了，但是那一夜，起来换岗的战士挨个地都来给我盖被子，给火炉添煤，虽然他们的动作都很轻，但是因为我的心情很激动，根本没有睡着，所以每个人来我都清清楚楚。战士们这样关心我，爱护我，这是多么深厚的无产阶级感情呵！当时我感动得流下了泪。我下一次连队，就受到一次教育，忠于毛主席的无产阶级感情就增一分。到战士中间，战士也真正把我看作阶级兄弟，看作普通一兵。现在我一到连队，许多同志就找我谈心，他们不说“团长来了”，而说“老兵来啦！”我听了确实感到亲切。我是遵照毛主席关于放下臭架子、甘当小学生的教导，和林副主席关于要正确对待自己、正确对待群众的指示去这样做的。我想，只有这样才能更好地促进思想革命化。
    通过在连队跟战士同吃同住，互相谈心，使我更加熟悉和了解了战士。生活在战士中间，我觉得朝气蓬勃，斗志旺盛，越活越年轻。
    这些年来，我深入连队，愿意和战士生活在一起。这是什么力量支配我这样做呢？这是毛主席他老人家教导的结果。毛主席怎么说，我就怎么做。
    在旧社会，我家房无一间，地无一垄，七岁时我就跟着父亲沿门讨饭，十一岁就给地主放牛，整天跟牛马生活在一起，一直到我十四岁那年，毛主席他老人家把我解放出来，参加了革命，跟着毛主席，跟着林副主席参加了抗日战争和解放战争。全国解放以后，在毛泽东思想哺育下，我又有了新的进步。
    一九六三年十月一日，是我永生难忘的一天。这一天我第一次见到了日夜想念的伟大领袖、我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。当时，我心情非常激动，不知不觉地流下了热泪。当时我发誓：一定要跟着毛主席走，一定要紧跟毛主席干一辈子革命。每当五一节、国庆节，每当知道毛主席要接见红卫兵的时候，我的心情总是特别激动，总要和战士们一起坚守岗位，警惕地保卫伟大领袖毛主席。有时候同志们要我去吃饭，去休息，我想，毛主席他老人家还在天安门上向群众招手呢！我怎么能回去吃饭，怎么能去休息。由于我心里想着伟大领袖毛主席，所以不感到饿，也不感到困，浑身都是劲。我想，作为毛主席的忠诚战士，能为保卫毛主席站一班岗，就是最大的幸福。我要永远生活在群众之中，永远做群众的小学生，永远当普通一兵，永远为毛主席站好岗、放好哨。
