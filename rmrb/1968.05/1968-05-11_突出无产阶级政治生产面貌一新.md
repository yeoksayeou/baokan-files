The revolutionary workers of the Duyun Hemp Textile Mill in Guizhou Province have been continuously carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle, eliminating the poisonous influence of the counterrevolutionary revisionism of the Chinese Khrushchev, and the entire mill has exceeded its production plan for last year. This year, the first quarter's production plan has also been completed ahead of schedule and in excess.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guizhou: The Revolutionary Committee of Duyun Hemp Textile Mill has led the entire mill's revolutionary workers to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, to carry out a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism and struggle, to continually eliminate the counterrevolutionary revisionist poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, to promote the thought revolution of the people, and to push forward the rapid development of production. This originally backward enterprise has now become an advanced collective in Guizhou Province for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and the production situation has basically changed. Last year, the mill completed the annual production plan ahead of schedule and in excess. This year, the mill's production task is double that of last year, and the first quarter's production plan has also been completed ahead of schedule and in excess, creating the most outstanding production achievement since the mill's establishment more than ten years ago.

In the past, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party faithfully implemented the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev in the Duyun Hemp Textile Mill, advocating "profits first," "technology first," and "bonuses first," and promoting material incentives, in an attempt to restore capitalism. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary faction in the mill seized back the power usurped by the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and established the Revolutionary Committee in March last year. The members of the Revolutionary Committee deeply realized that the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee was only the starting point of a new struggle.

Over the past year, the Revolutionary Committee of Duyun Hemp Textile Mill has led the entire mill's revolutionary workers to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, to deeply criticize the reactionary fallacies spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, such as "good production is good politics." Chairman Mao's great teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work" has deeply taken root in the minds of the revolutionary workers. The workers said that in the past, the capitalist roaders opposed us in highlighting proletarian politics and in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, using the ghostly talk of "good production is good politics" to poison us, intending to turn us into apolitical mediocrities, so as to facilitate their restoration of capitalism and make us suffer twice. The workers expressed in the revolutionary criticism and struggle that they must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose," and must highlight proletarian politics everywhere, study Chairman Mao's works every day, and use Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle in everything, striving to turn the factory into a red-hot school of Mao Zedong Thought. The mill has been running Mao Zedong Thought study classes since last June, and so far, twenty sessions have been held, with all the cadres and workers in the mill having undergone one round of training. Many family members have also organized themselves to run study classes. Workers and family members study Chairman Mao's works in the evening study classes, thoroughly criticize the bourgeoisie. The factory, workshop, or team frequently holds meetings to share experiences in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and the entire mill has created a good situation where everyone studies Chairman Mao's works every day. In the rear spinning workshop, 41 out of 127 workers have emerged as active elements in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The doffer worker Sheng Dongzhen in this workshop used to not care about politics, work for pay, and had a poor attitude towards labor. After studying in the study class and participating in the revolutionary criticism and struggle, she realized that she had been poisoned by the "material incentive" of the Chinese Khrushchev in the past. She seriously criticized and repudiated her private thoughts and bourgeois ideas, establishing the revolutionary viewpoint of wholeheartedly serving the people to spin yarn. From then on, she actively studied Chairman Mao's works, actively participated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and was evaluated as an active element in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. In production, her daily output has always been at the forefront of the entire workshop. The Revolutionary Committee of Duyun Hemp Textile Mill has always insisted on leading the entire mill's revolutionary workers to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and to carry out a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism and struggle. The ideological appearance of the revolutionary workers has undergone a great change, and Sheng Dongzhen is just one example. As Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "When Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses, it will become an inexhaustible force and an atomic bomb of tremendous power."

Over the past year, Duyun Hemp Textile Mill has closely combined various tasks with revolutionary criticism and struggle, effectively promoting various works. This year, the production task assigned by the state to Duyun Hemp Textile Mill is double that of last year. Some comrades felt that the task was heavy, the difficulties were many, and the confidence in completing the task was not great. The technical department, based on the task assigned by the state, proposed a plan to increase equipment and personnel. The Revolutionary Committee, after discussion, believed that how to deal with this year's task also involved a struggle between the two lines. The Revolutionary Committee decided to lead the revolutionary workers to further carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle, to fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, to overcome difficulties, and to complete this year's task. The equipment of this mill is outdated, and many "old and difficult" technical problems have not been solved for a long time. In the past, the capitalist roaders once staged the farce of "rewarding the breakthrough," which was chaotic and did not solve the problem. Now, the Revolutionary Committee has exposed this farce staged by the capitalist roaders and handed it over to the revolutionary workers for severe criticism. Through the revolutionary criticism and struggle, everyone realized that the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, relying on a few "technical experts" and promoting "material incentives," etc., were the revisionist line, the capitalist way of running a factory. The proletarian revolutionary faction seized power and must break with their line, and must resolutely follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao, to mobilize the masses and rely on the masses to solve problems. Three new workers in the hemp boiling section, with Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, displayed the fearless spirit of daring to think, dare to do, and dare to make a revolution, and after two months of hard struggle, successfully experimented with an advanced method of hemp boiling, doubling the output of hemp boiling and breaking through the technical difficulty of insufficient steam supply for hemp boiling. These three new workers deeply felt that with Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, one can be victorious in all battles, and any "obstacle" is nothing to fear. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the mill Revolutionary Committee fully relied on the masses, respected the masses' pioneering spirit, and organized "three-in-one" small groups consisting of workers, technical personnel, and revolutionary cadres to solve a series of "old and difficult" problems in production technology. The hemp drying machine, which had never been dared to be repaired and had been leaking gas and water for a long time, was repaired; the "obsolete" winged bobbin drawing frame, high-pressure boiler, hemp beating machine, centrifuge, sizing machine, and other machines that the capitalist roaders were ready to discard were all reborn, and production efficiency was greatly improved. Everyone deeply felt that with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, to carry out a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism and struggle, to thoroughly eliminate the counterrevolutionary revisionist poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, and to highlight proletarian politics, people's thoughts will change and the factory will be transformed.

    突出无产阶级政治生产面貌一新
    都匀麻纺厂革命职工持续开展革命大批判，清除中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义流毒，全厂去年超额完成计划，今年第一季度计划又提前超额完成
    据新华社贵阳电　贵州省都匀麻纺厂革命委员会带领全厂革命职工，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，深入持久地开展革命大批判，不断清除中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人散布的反革命修正主义流毒，促进了人的思想革命化，推动了生产的迅速发展。这个原来生产落后的企业，现在是贵州省工业战线活学活用毛主席著作的先进集体，生产面貌已经基本改观。去年，这个厂提前超额完成了全年生产计划。今年，这个厂的生产任务比去年增加一倍，第一季度生产计划又提前超额完成，创造了建厂十多年来最出色的生产成绩。
    过去，党内一小撮走资派在都匀麻纺厂忠实推行中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线，大搞“利润挂帅”、
  “技术挂帅”和“奖金挂帅”，大搞“物质刺激”，妄图复辟资本主义。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，这个厂的无产阶级革命派把党内一小撮走资派窃踞的权力夺了回来，在去年三月成立了革命委员会。革委会的成员们深深认识到，革委会的成立，只是新的战斗的起点。
    一年多来，都匀麻纺厂革委会带领全厂革命职工，以毛泽东思想为武器，深刻地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所散布的“生产好就是政治好”等反动谬论。毛主席关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的伟大教导，在革命职工头脑中深深地扎了根。工人们说，过去走资派反对我们突出无产阶级政治，反对我们活学活用毛泽东思想，用“生产好就是政治好”的鬼话来毒害我们，就是妄想把我们变成不问政治的庸人，以便于他们复辟资本主义，让我们受二遍苦。工人们在革命大批判中表示，一定要牢牢记住毛主席“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对”的教导，处处突出无产阶级政治，天天学习毛主席著作，事事用毛泽东思想挂帅，努力把工厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。这个厂从去年六月就开办了毛泽东思想学习班，到目前为止，已经办了二十期，全厂干部、工人普遍轮训了一次。很多家属也组织起来，办起了学习班。工人和家属在业余学习班里学习毛主席著作，彻底批判资产阶级。工厂、车间或班组，经常召开活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会，全厂出现了人人学习毛主席著作，天天学习毛主席著作的大好局面。后纺车间的一百二十七名工人中，涌现出了四十一名活学活用毛泽东思想的积极分子。这个车间的挡车工盛冬珍，过去不关心政治，干活计较报酬，劳动态度不好。经过在学习班学习和参加革命大批判，她认识到自己过去是中了中国赫鲁晓夫“物质刺激”的毒。她认真地斗私批修，树立了全心全意为人民纺纱的革命观点。从此以后，她积极学习毛主席著作，积极参加无产阶级文化大革命运动，被评为活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子。她在生产上，日产量始终在全车间保持着领先地位。都匀麻纺厂革委会由于始终坚持带领全厂革命职工活学活用毛泽东思想，深入持久地开展革命大批判，革命职工的思想面貌发生了极大的变化，盛冬珍只是其中的一个例子。这正如林彪副主席所指出的：
  “毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”
    一年多来，都匀麻纺厂紧紧结合各项任务开展革命大批判，有力地推动了各项工作。今年国家下达给都匀麻纺厂的生产任务比去年增加一倍，有的同志觉得任务重，困难多，完成任务的信心不大。技术部门根据国家下达的任务，提出了一个增加设备和人员的计划。革委会经过讨论认为，怎样对待今年的任务，这里也存在着两条路线的斗争。革委会决定带领革命职工，进一步开展革命大批判，充分调动群众的积极性和创造性，克服困难，完成今年的任务。这个厂的设备陈旧，许多“老大难”的技术难关长期解决不了。过去，走资派曾演出“悬赏破关”的丑剧，搞得乌烟瘴气，也没有解决问题。如今，革委会就把走资派搞的这个丑剧端出来，交给革命职工狠狠批判。通过革命大批判，大家认识到，中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派依靠少数“技术专家”，大搞“物质刺激”等等，是修正主义的那一套，是资本家办厂的那一套。无产阶级革命派掌了权，必须破除他们那一套，要坚决沿着毛主席指引的道路，放手发动群众，依靠群众解决问题。煮麻工段有三个新学工，用毛泽东思想挂帅，发扬敢想、敢干、敢革命的大无畏精神，经过两个月的艰苦奋斗，试验成功一种煮麻的先进方法，使煮麻的产量提高了两倍，攻下了煮麻所用的水汽供应不足的技术难关。这三个新学工深有体会地说，毛泽东思想挂帅，就能百战百胜，任何“拦路虎”都不在话下。在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，厂革委会充分依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，组织了有工人、技术人员和革命干部参加的“三结合”小组，解决了一系列生产技术上的
  “老大难”问题。从来没有敢动的、长期漏气漏水的烘麻机，整修好了；被走资派准备弃置不要的、 “老掉牙”的翼锭拈线机、高压锅、打麻机、离心机、浆纱机等都获得了新生，生产效率大大提高。大家深深体会到，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，深入持久地开展革命大批判，彻底清除中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人散布的反革命修正主义流毒，大力突出无产阶级政治，就会使人换思想厂换装。
