The Chinese Khrushchev, during a period of temporary economic difficulties in our country, used the banner of "mobilizing the peasants' enthusiasm for production" to spread the black wind of "contracting production to households." He attempted to lead us down the capitalist path, undermine the socialist collective economy, and achieve his goal of restoring capitalism. Did the Chinese Khrushchev truly want to mobilize the peasants' enthusiasm for production? What kind of enthusiasm did he want to mobilize? Where did he want to direct this enthusiasm? Just by peeling off his disguise, the truth becomes clear.

Great Leader Chairman Mao taught us: "Only socialism can save China." Therefore, he called on us to "organize together." Chairman Mao's words struck a chord in our hearts. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we poor and lower-middle peasants have steadfastly followed the path of socialist collectivization toward common prosperity. Production has flourished, the collective economy has rapidly developed, and people's lives have improved day by day.

The Chinese Khrushchev, relying on his counterrevolutionary experience, knew that to restore capitalism, he must uproot the foundation of socialism—the socialist collective economy. Therefore, this cunning and treacherous old counterrevolutionary spread the black wind of "self-reliance, self-management, and contracting production to households," launching a ferocious attack on the socialist collective economy. He wanted to drag us back to the old capitalist road, allowing landlords and rich peasants to ride on our backs again, squeezing our oil and drinking our blood. Yet, the Chinese Khrushchev maliciously claimed that this was to "mobilize the peasants' enthusiasm for production." Pfft! This is a gross slander against us poor and lower-middle peasants. We poor and lower-middle peasants have only socialist enthusiasm. The enthusiasm the Chinese Khrushchev wants to mobilize is not our enthusiasm for building socialism but the enthusiasm of landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and counterrevolutionary revisionists for restoring capitalism.

When the evil wind of "self-reliance, self-management, and contracting production to households" blew into our area, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party and landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists thought their dream of restoring capitalism was about to come true. They colluded and spread rumors, stirring up trouble, and desperately tried to implement "contracting production to households," even howling for "dividing land" and "dividing fields." At that time, our production team also faced a black wind of "land redistribution" and "contracting production to households." What is this "contracting production to households"? In essence, it is giving land to individual members to farm privately, making them engage in individual farming, and retracing our steps.

Great Leader Chairman Mao said: "In the peasantry, for thousands of years, it has been individual economy, one household being one production unit. This scattered individual production is the economic foundation of feudal rule, and it makes the peasants themselves sink into everlasting poverty."

Chairman Mao's words spoke to the bitter experiences of us peasants under individual farming. The Chinese Khrushchev wants to push us back into the sea of suffering, and we firmly refuse! We poor and lower-middle peasants follow Chairman Mao with one heart on the bright socialist path. When the black wind of "contracting production to households" blew fiercely, the poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres in our production team made up their minds to fight against this capitalist tide, insisted on the socialist path, and smashed the evil plots of the Chinese Khrushchev and the landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists.

Now, our production team further studies Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as an extremely sharp weapon to expose the cover of class struggle, two-line struggle, and two-path struggle in the countryside, eliminate the poison of "self-reliance, self-management, and contracting production to households," and further consolidate and develop the socialist collective economy.

    中国赫鲁晓夫要调动什么积极性？
    第一生产队长　张中福
    中国赫鲁晓夫在我国暂时经济困难的时候，打着“调动农民生产积极性”的招牌，大刮“包产到户”的黑风，妄图把我们引向资本主义的邪路，瓦解社会主义集体经济，达到他复辟资本主义的目的。中国赫鲁晓夫真的是为了调动农民的生产“积极性”吗？他要调动的是什么样的“积极性”呢？他要把“积极性”往那里调呢？只要撕开他的画皮看一看，就清楚了。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“只有社会主义能够救中国。”所以号召我们“组织起来”。毛主席的话说到我们心坎上了。我们贫下中农在毛主席的英明领导下，坚定不移地走上了共同富裕的社会主义集体化道路，生产蒸蒸日上，集体经济迅速发展，人民生活一天比一天好。
    中国赫鲁晓夫凭着他的反革命经验，知道要复辟资本主义，就必须挖掉社会主义的墙脚——社会主义集体经济。所以，这个老奸巨猾的老反革命大刮“三自一包”的黑风，向社会主义集体经济猖狂进攻，硬要把我们拉回到资本主义的老路，让地主、富农重新骑在我们身上，榨我们的油，喝我们的血。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫却阴险毒辣地说，这是为了“调动农民的生产积极性”。呸！这是对我们贫下中农的莫大诬蔑。我们贫下中农只有社会主义的积极性，中国赫鲁晓夫要调动的“积极性”，不是我们贫下中农建设社会主义的积极性，而是地富反坏右分子复辟资本主义的积极性。
    当“三自一包”这股妖风刮到我们这个地区的时候，一小撮党内走资派和地富反坏右分子，以为他们复辟资本主义的美梦就要实现，就串通一气，到处煽阴风，点鬼火，拚命地要搞“包产到户”，甚至嚎叫要“分田”、
  “分地”。这时，我们生产队也刮起了一股“土地下放”、“产量包到户”的黑风。什么“产量包到户”，说穿了，就是把土地分给社员私人种，要社员搞单干，走回头路。
    伟大领袖毛主席说：“在农民群众方面，几千年来都是个体经济，一家一户就是一个生产单位，这种分散的个体生产，就是封建统治的经济基础，而使农民自己陷于永远的穷苦。”
    毛主席的话把我们农民受单干的苦都说出来了。中国赫鲁晓夫要把我们重新推到苦海中去，我们坚决不答应！我们贫下中农一个心眼跟着毛主席走社会主义的光明大道。当“产量包到户”的黑风刮得很凶的时候，我们生产队的贫下中农和干部，都下定决心跟这股资本主义逆流作斗争，坚持了社会主义道路，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫和地富反坏右分子的罪恶阴谋。
    现在，我们生产队进一步大学毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想这一无比锐利的武器，大揭农村两个阶级、两条道路和两条路线斗争的盖子，肃清“三自一包”的流毒，进一步巩固和发展社会主义集体经济。
