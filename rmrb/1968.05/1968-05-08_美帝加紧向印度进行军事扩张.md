The U.S. imperialists are exploiting India's strategic position to intensify their military expansion into India, viewing it as a base for aggression against China and suppressing national liberation movements.

The U.S.'s main tactic for controlling India militarily is to incite the Indian reactionaries to create conflicts on the Sino-Indian border, and then use military "aid" to infiltrate. In 1962, after India launched a military invasion on the Sino-Indian border, then-U.S. President Kennedy eagerly ordered the rush delivery of military supplies to India. Since then, the U.S. has provided India with $340 million in military "aid."

With the U.S. military "aid" came a large number of American military personnel infiltrating India. These personnel have penetrated into various military departments and arms factories in India, establishing strongholds for U.S. influence.

The U.S. also uses military "aid" to push India into a military alliance with the U.S. and to undertake military obligations. In June 1963, the Indian president and Kennedy issued a joint statement openly declaring that the U.S. and India would "share" the so-called "common defense" against China. Soon after, India used this as a basis to sign an "air defense agreement" with the U.S. and Britain. After the agreement was signed, the U.S. Christian Science Monitor proudly declared that this "ended India's non-aligned status," and a new military alliance had been "born."

Not only that, the U.S. uses military "aid" to build military bases on Indian territory and use Indian military bases. When the U.S. decided to expand the activities of the Seventh Fleet to the Indian Ocean, the Indian News Agency announced in February 1964 that the Andaman naval base, built with U.S. help, was officially in use. Additionally, according to revelations by the Pakistani Morning News, the U.S. and Britain began quietly using the Indian naval base on Car Nicobar Island starting in 1965 to station troops in the Indian Ocean. Recently, Pakistani newspapers revealed that India is collaborating with the U.S. to establish a "seismological research station" in the Indian-occupied Kashmir region to detect Chinese nuclear tests, and a base to intercept Chinese radio communications.

Thus, India's territory, from the air to the sea, has been opened to the U.S. This is the shameful record of India gradually becoming a tool for U.S. aggression.

### 美帝加紧向印度进行军事扩张

　　美帝加紧向印度进行军事扩张
    美帝国主义正在利用印度的战略地位，加紧向印度进行军事扩张，把印度看作它反华和镇压民族解放运动的一个侵略基地。
    美帝对印度进行军事控制的主要一手，是唆使印度反动派制造中印边界冲突，然后利用军“援”大举打入。一九六二年，印度在中印边境发动军事侵略后几天，美国当时的总统肯尼迪就迫不及待地下令赶运军火给印度。自从那时候以来，美帝给印度的军事“援助”已达三亿四千万美元。
    随着美帝军“援”而来的，是大批美国军事人员侵入印度。这些人员深入到印度各个军事部门和军火工厂，建立了美国势力的据点。
    美帝还通过军“援”促使印度在军事上同美国结盟并承担军事义务。一九六三年六月，印度总统同肯尼迪发表联合公报，公然宣布美印要“分担”对付中国的所谓“共同防御事业”。不久，印度就据此同美、英签订了“空防协定”。协定签订后，美国《基督教科学箴言报》满意地宣称，这“结束了印度的不结盟状态”，一个新的军事联盟“诞生了”。
    不仅如此，美帝还利用军“援”在印度领土上不断修建军事基地和使用印度军事基地。当美帝决定把第七舰队的活动扩大到印度洋以后，印度新闻处于一九六四年二月宣布，美国帮助印度修建的安达曼海军基地正式启用。另外，据巴基斯坦《晨报》揭露，美英从一九六五年开始悄悄地使用卡尔尼科巴岛上的印度海军基地，以便在印度洋驻军。最近，巴基斯坦报纸又揭露，印度正在同美国合作，在克什米尔印度占领区建立一个探测中国核试验的“地震实验所”和一个探听中国无线电通讯的基地。
    这样，印度的领土，从空中到海上，都已对美帝开放。这就是印度在军事上一步步沦为美帝侵略工具的可耻纪录。
