Currently, it is the busy spring plowing season. We, the broad masses of rural commune members, are actively responding to the call of our great leader Chairman Mao, grasping revolution and promoting production, and seizing every minute to carry out spring plowing production. One day, our hoe broke. After breakfast, I went to the nearby supply and marketing cooperative to buy a new hoe. However, I went to two cooperatives, and both had their doors locked. By then, it was almost nine o'clock, and they had not yet started business. I had no choice but to run another six or seven miles to the central supply and marketing cooperative to buy the hoe.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "At present, it is the spring plowing season. I hope that all leading comrades, cadres, and the masses in the liberated areas will seize the opportunity to grasp the production links and achieve greater results than last year." Now is the time when all sectors must vigorously support agriculture. The work arrangements of the supply and marketing cooperatives must be convenient for the masses and beneficial to production. I suggest that supply and marketing cooperatives with similar situations change their practice of opening late and closing early. They should truly take the initiative to support agricultural production in a timely, quick, and good manner.

    供销社要方便群众有利生产
    目前正当春耕大忙季节，我们农村广大社员，积极响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，狠抓革命，猛促生产，争分夺秒地进行春耕生产。有一天，我们的铁锨坏了，吃完早饭，我就到附近的供销社去，想买一把新的铁锨回来。可是走了两个供销社，都是锁头把着门，那时已经快九点了，还没有开始营业。我没有办法，只好又跑了六七里地，到中心供销社去才把铁锨买回来。
    毛主席教导我们：“目前正当春耕时节，希望一切解放区的领导同志、工作人员、人民群众，不失时机地掌握生产环节，取得比去年更大的成绩。”现在正是需要各行各业大力支援农业的时候，供销合作社安排工作必须方便群众，有利生产。我建议有类似情况的供销社改变晚开门、早关门的作法，真正地把支援农业生产的工作做得主动适时，又快又好。
