The revolutionary criticism in Hongjing Brigade of Jiangsu Province's Taicang County is well done. They prioritize the study of Chairman Mao's works, conduct revolutionary criticism in conjunction with various tasks, and deeply and fiercely criticize the class enemies like China's Khrushchev. This has educated the broad masses and promoted both revolution and production.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, May 4th: The poor and lower-middle peasants in Hongjing Brigade, a model unit for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, have been deeply and persistently conducting revolutionary criticism under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, following the brilliant path indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive." Through revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have further recognized the reactionary nature of China's Khrushchev and his local agents, raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and powerfully promoted both revolution and production.

The revolutionary criticism in Hongjing Brigade began in early April of last year. Over the past year, they have remembered Chairman Mao's teachings about the need for communes to criticize the bourgeoisie, wielded the mighty weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, and launched wave after wave of fierce attacks against China's Khrushchev and his agents. In the fields, at the corners of the land, in the courtyards, in the houses, and on the boats, everywhere has become a battlefield for denouncing China's Khrushchev.

Hongjing Brigade has conducted revolutionary criticism according to the characteristics of different production seasons and labor types, adapting to local conditions, time, and individuals. During the busy season, they adopt small, dispersed, and flexible forms, mainly holding small criticism meetings in the fields, courtyards, and homes. During the off-season, they mainly hold large, centralized criticism meetings. The "five craftsmen" who frequently go out to work, such as those involved in bamboo, grass, masonry, gardening, and sewing, regularly gather to conduct revolutionary criticism against China's Khrushchev. Over the past year, the revolutionary criticism in this brigade has surged higher and higher, never before has a mass movement been so deeply, persistently, and broadly mobilized.

In the process of revolutionary criticism, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjing Brigade have placed the study of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront, continuously launching new high tides of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They study Chairman Mao's relevant teachings according to the key points of each stage of criticism, criticizing China's Khrushchev's black words one by one. This approach makes the target clear and the firepower concentrated, allowing for deep and thorough criticism with good results. They have deeply felt that the process of revolutionary criticism is the process of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and the process of thoroughly criticizing bourgeois ideology and establishing Mao Zedong Thought.

The deep and persistent revolutionary criticism in Hongjing Brigade began with class education. At the start of the revolutionary criticism, some people did not fully understand its significance. The brigade organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, focusing on the actual struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, and conducted reminiscence and comparison activities, as well as bitter-sweet remembrance activities, to widely carry out class and class struggle education. They combined the situation of the criticism with inviting old poor peasants to tell "three histories"; combined with the year-end distribution, they had bitter-sweet meals and held family bitter-sweet remembrance meetings. Through bitter-sweet remembrance and class education, the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the community members were greatly enhanced, deepening their hatred for China's Khrushchev and igniting their limitless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. They said, "No matter how bad it is, China's Khrushchev making us take the backward road is the worst." "We will never forget our class bitterness when we stand up, and we will never forget Chairman Mao when we are happy."

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjing Brigade, in connection with the actual class struggle in their brigade, fiercely criticized China's Khrushchev's theory of "class struggle extinction." The community members studied Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle" and sharpened their eyes, enhancing their class vigilance. They exposed the heinous crimes of the local landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists attempting to stage a comeback. At the criticism meeting, the poor and lower-middle peasants held up an account book of a reactionary landlord and angrily said, "China's Khrushchev advocates the theory of 'class struggle extinction,' which is completely a sedative. He wants us to forget class struggle and proletarian dictatorship so that they can restore capitalism. We must never forget class struggle and will never fall for his tricks." The living facts of class struggle made the broad masses of community members enhance their class struggle consciousness. Even those who had previously been complacent said, "The enemy is sharpening his knife, how can we sleep soundly? We must not be too naive and simplify the complex class struggle."

Conducting revolutionary criticism in conjunction with various tasks is the key to ensuring that the revolutionary criticism is deeply and persistently carried out. Hongjing Brigade further used the method of combining one task with learning one of Chairman Mao's quotations, criticizing one of China's Khrushchev's reactionary points, eliminating one aspect of his poison, and establishing one revolutionary viewpoint to deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, closely combining the criticism with the establishment.

As soon as the spring plowing production began this year, the community members of Hongjing Brigade studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, exposed the evil activities of class enemies' frantic counterattacks, fiercely criticized China's Khrushchev's black goods of the theory of "class struggle extinction," further established the concept of class struggle, formed a team of mass dictatorship, strengthened the supervision and education of class enemies, and ensured the successful progress of spring plowing production. When formulating the sowing plan, they studied Chairman Mao's teachings on comprehensive planning, fiercely criticized China's Khrushchev's black goods of "four freedoms," corrected the tendency of some people to plant less grain and more economic crops, and further firmed up their determination to plant according to the state plan. When accumulating and making fertilizer, they studied Chairman Mao's instructions on self-reliance, fiercely criticized China's Khrushchev's black goods of "material incentives," overcame the dependence mentality of some people, and further firmed up their determination to learn from Dazhai and follow the Dazhai road. During the busy season of rushing harvest and sowing, they studied Chairman Mao's discussions on political leadership, fiercely criticized China's Khrushchev's black goods of "work points leadership," consolidated and developed the advanced management system of Dazhai, and further established the idea of farming for revolution. When distributing income, they studied Chairman Mao's great instructions of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," fiercely criticized China's Khrushchev's black goods of "public-private fusion," and completed the grain and cotton delivery tasks in excess.

Conducting revolutionary criticism in conjunction with various tasks has deeply criticized the handful of capitalist roaders within the party led by China's Khrushchev, fiercely fought against class enemies, and greatly educated the broad masses. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, "Once connected with reality, it feels like China's Khrushchev's poison has reached Taicang Hongjing. We deeply hate and fiercely criticize China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party."

　　洪泾大队革命大批判搞得好
    他们把学习毛主席著作放在首位，结合各项任务开展革命大批判，对中国赫鲁晓夫等阶级敌人批得深，斗得狠，教育了广大群众，促进了革命和生产
    据新华社南京四日电　活学活用毛主席著作先进单位江苏省太仓县洪泾大队的贫下中农，高举毛泽东思想革命批判大旗，沿着伟大领袖毛主席“五·七”指示的光辉航道，深入持久地开展革命大批判。通过革命大批判，广大贫下中农进一步认清了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本地区代理人的反动本质，提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，有力地促进了革命和生产。
    洪泾大队的革命大批判从去年四月初就开始了。一年多来，他们牢记毛主席关于公社农民也要批判资产阶级的教导，奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人发起了一次又一次猛烈的进攻。在田边、地角、场头、屋里、船上，到处都是声讨中国赫鲁晓夫的战场。
    洪泾大队根据生产季节和劳动工种不同的特点，因地、因时、因人制宜地开展革命大批判。大忙季节，采取小型分散，灵活多样的形式，以田头、场头、家庭的小型批判会为主。农闲时，以集中的大型批判会为主。经常外出做工的篾、草作、泥水、园木、缝衣等“五匠”，定期集中，对中国赫鲁晓夫开展革命的大批判。一年多来，这个大队的革命大批判一浪高过一浪，从来的群众运动，都没有象这次革命大批判发动得这么深入，这么持久，这么广泛。
    在革命大批判中，洪泾大队的贫下中农把学习毛主席著作放在首位，不断掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。他们根据每个阶段批判内容的重点，学习毛主席的有关教导，对中国赫鲁晓夫的黑话一条一条地进行批判，这样做，目标明确，火力集中，批得深，批得透，效果很好。他们深有体会地说，革命大批判的过程，就是活学活用毛主席著作的过程，就是大破资产阶级思想、大立毛泽东思想的过程。
    洪泾大队深入持久的革命大批判，是从开展阶级教育入手的。革命大批判开始时，有一些群众对大批判的意义认识不足，大队就组织大家学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，围绕两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的实际，开展回忆对比、忆苦思甜活动，广泛进行阶级和阶级斗争教育。他们结合大批判的形势，请老贫农讲“三史”；结合年终分配，吃忆苦饭，开展家庭忆苦思甜会。通过忆苦思甜和开展阶级教育，大大提高了社员群众的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，加深了对中国赫鲁晓夫的深仇大恨；激发了对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。他们说：“千坏万坏，中国赫鲁晓夫叫我们走回头路最坏。”“我们翻身不忘阶级苦，幸福不忘毛主席。”
    洪泾大队贫下中农联系本大队阶级斗争的实际，狠狠批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。社员们学习了毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，擦亮了眼睛，增强了阶级警惕性，揭发了本大队地、富、反、坏、右妄图反攻倒算的滔天罪行。在批判会上，贫下中农拿起一个反动地主的“变天账”，愤怒地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹‘阶级斗争熄灭’论，完全是一帖麻醉剂，他妄想叫我们忘记阶级斗争，忘记无产阶级专政，好让他们搞资本主义复辟。我们要念念不忘阶级斗争，决不上他的当。”活生生的阶级斗争事实，使广大社员群众提高了阶级斗争觉悟。原来有麻痹思想的社员也说：敌人在磨刀，我们怎么能睡大觉？我们“切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了”。
    结合各项任务开展革命大批判，是保证革命大批判深入持久开展下去的关键。洪泾大队进一步运用结合一项工作，学习一条毛主席语录，批判中国赫鲁晓夫一个反动论点，肃清一个方面的流毒，树立一个革命观点的方法，把革命大批判深入持久地开展下去，把破与立紧密地结合在一起。
    今年春耕生产刚开始，洪泾大队社员就大学毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，大揭阶级敌人疯狂反扑的罪恶活动，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”论的黑货，进一步树立了阶级斗争观念，建立起一支群众专政的队伍，加强对阶级敌人的监督管教，保证春耕生产胜利进行。在制定播种规划的时候，他们就大学毛主席关于统筹兼顾的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“四大自由”的黑货，纠正了一些人想少种粮食，多种经济作物的倾向，进一步坚定了按国家计划种植的决心。在积肥造肥的时候，他们就大学毛主席关于自力更生的指示，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“物质刺激”的黑货，克服了一些人的依赖思想，进一步坚定了学大寨精神，走大寨道路的决心。在抢收抢种的大忙季节，他们就大学毛主席关于政治挂帅的论述，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“工分挂帅”等黑货，巩固和发展了大寨式先进管理制度，进一步树立了为革命种田的思想。在收益分配的时候，他们就大学毛主席关于“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大指示，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“大公有私”、“公私溶化”等黑货，超额完成了粮棉交售任务。
    结合各项任务开展革命大批判，对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派批得深，对阶级敌人打得狠，大大教育了广大群众。贫下中农说：“一联系实际，就觉得中国赫鲁晓夫的毒放到了太仓洪泾，我们就对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派恨得深，批得狠。”
