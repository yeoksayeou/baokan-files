The economic situation in the imperialist countries is worsening, and they are increasingly competing against each other. The struggle between France and the United States for raw materials and markets is particularly fierce, and in some instances, it has escalated to direct confrontation.

The Oil Struggle

In the competition for raw materials, the monopolistic capital groups of France and the United States are fiercely vying for oil exploration and extraction rights in the Middle East. Last November, a French oil trust secured the right to explore for oil in an area of approximately 10,000 square kilometers in southeastern Iraq. In recent months, another major French oil monopoly has been negotiating with Iraqi authorities to secure the right to extract oil in the oil-rich Rumaila-North region. Once France obtains the extraction rights in this region, it can increase its current annual oil production by 50%.

The aforementioned two regions were originally under the control of the "Iraq Petroleum Company," a joint venture of oil monopolies from the United States, Britain, France, and the Netherlands. After Iraq regained control of these two regions in 1961, the United States, in collaboration with Britain, France, and the Netherlands, imposed a blockade on Iraq, preventing any Western oil companies from signing exploration or extraction contracts with Iraq. Now, France has broken this "united front," clearly targeting the United States, which has made the United States both angry and frustrated, accusing France of "betrayal."

Infiltration and Counter-Infiltration

In the struggle for raw materials, France is vigorously attempting to expel American influence worldwide, while also preventing the United States from entering regions under French control. For example, in the French-administered New Caledonia in the Pacific, the local nickel mines, which are rich in resources, have long been monopolized by a French company. Due to the depletion of nickel, a crucial strategic resource, in the United States and Canada, and the rising prices of nickel on the global market, several American companies have strongly demanded the breaking of the monopoly by the French company to gain extraction rights. Seeing the encroachment of American influence, the French government quickly stepped in, raising funds to ensure that French capital holds 60% of the shares in the second nickel mining company to be established in New Caledonia. Franco-American conflicts are also evident in the competition for uranium and other rare metals.

Competing for Arms Deals

In the struggle for commodity markets, the monopolistic capital groups of France and the United States are fiercely competing for arms deals, particularly for aircraft and tanks. Currently, a key point of contention is the aircraft orders from countries like Brazil and Peru in Latin America. The governments of Brazil and Peru had previously expressed their willingness to purchase a type of French jet fighter. The French government and the aircraft industry attach great importance to this, aiming to break into the Latin American market dominated by the United States. However, the United States quickly intervened to obstruct this, with American diplomats even warning the governments of Brazil and Peru, threatening to reduce "aid." This has sparked fierce criticism from French monopoly capitalist newspapers.

France and the United States are also in fierce competition in selling weapons to NATO countries. Currently, both sides are vying for a deal to sell over a hundred jet fighters to Belgium. The French newspaper "Paris Radical News" recently published an article listing the ways in which the United States has sabotaged contracts for the purchase of French fighter jets, helicopters, and tanks by West Germany and Belgium, expressing strong dissatisfaction with the United States' exclusion of France.

　　经济情况越来越糟　销售市场越来越小
　　法美争夺资源和市场斗争空前激化
    在帝国主义各国经济状况越来越糟、互相加紧倾轧的情况下，法国和美国争夺原料资源和商品销售市场的斗争十分激烈，在某些场合已经发展到短兵相接的地步。
    石油争夺战
    在争夺原料资源方面，法美两国垄断资本集团争夺中东石油开采和勘探权利的角逐特别激烈。去年十一月，法国一个石油托拉斯在伊拉克东南部大约一万平方公里面积的地区，取得了勘探石油的权利。近几个月，另一家法国石油大垄断公司，又在同伊拉克方面谈判关于在伊拉克储油量丰富的鲁迈拉—诺特地区取得开采石油权利的合同。法国垄断资本在取得这个地区的石油开采权之后，就可以使法国目前掌握的每年石油开采量猛增百分之五十。
    上述两个地区的石油权益，原先都是在美、英、法、荷兰四国石油垄断资本合营的“伊拉克石油公司”控制之下。在一九六一年伊拉克收回这两个地区的石油“租借权”之后，美国就联合英、法、荷兰，对伊拉克进行抵制，不准任何西方国家的石油公司单独同伊拉克方面订立进行石油勘探或开采的合同。现在法国抢先打破了这一“联合阵线”，其矛头显然是首先针对美国的，这就使得美国又痛又恼，大骂法国“叛卖”。
    渗透反渗透
    法国在争夺原料资源的斗争中，一方面竭力在世界各地排挤美国的势力，另一方面，还设法不让美国侵入法国控制的地区。例如在太平洋法属新喀里多尼亚群岛，当地蕴藏丰富的镍矿一向是由一家法国公司垄断开采的。由于镍这种重要战略物资在美国和加拿大的蕴藏已经快开采完了，而世界市场上镍的价格又在不断上涨，几家美国公司就强烈要求打破法国这家公司独家垄断的局面，以便使美国也获得开采权。法国政府看到美国势力要挤进来，赶忙自己出面凑集一笔资金，使法国资本在新喀里多尼亚即将成立的第二家镍矿开采公司中占有百分之六十的股份。法美矛盾在争夺铀和其他一些稀有金属的资源方面也有所表现。
　　抢军火生意
    在争夺商品销售市场方面，法美垄断资本抢夺飞机、坦克等军火生意的斗争特别尖锐。目前法美在这方面一个争夺的焦点是巴西、秘鲁等一些拉丁美洲国家的军用飞机订货。巴西和秘鲁等一些政府前些时候曾经表示愿意订购法国的一种喷气式驱逐机。法国政府和飞机工业对此十分重视，企图借此使法国的军用飞机打进美国所垄断的拉丁美洲市场。但是美国很快就赶来阻挠，美国外交官甚至向巴西和秘鲁两国政府提出警告，以削减美“援”相威胁。这引起了法国垄断资产阶级报刊的激烈攻击。
    法国和美国在向北大西洋集团国家推销武器方面，也有着激烈的竞争。目前，双方正在争夺比利时购买一百多架喷气式驱逐机的一笔生意。法国的《巴黎激进新闻》不久前还发表文章，历数美国破坏西德、比利时购买法国驱逐机、直升飞机、坦克等合同的行径，对美国排挤法国非常不满。
