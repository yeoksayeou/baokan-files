The great leader Chairman Mao has taught us that after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, "the remnants of the overthrown landlord and comprador classes still exist, the bourgeoisie still exists, and the petty bourgeoisie has just begun to be transformed. Class struggle has not ended."

However, the Chinese Khrushchev sings a different tune from Chairman Mao. He shouts about how "the domestic enemies have basically been eliminated, the landlord class has long been eliminated, the bourgeoisie has basically been eliminated, and the counter-revolutionaries have also been basically eliminated." According to the Chinese Khrushchev, classes have been eliminated, and class struggle no longer exists. This is a deadly narcotic for the proletariat and the working people.

The Chinese Khrushchev advocates the theory of "extinguishing class struggle" to make us forget about classes and class struggle, so that the ghosts and monsters can come out and cause trouble, waiting for the opportunity to change the sky and ride on the heads of the poor and lower-middle peasants again. In fact, from the land reform to the present, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in our brigade have never been honest for a single day. They are always plotting to overthrow the government and dreaming of one day carrying out a counter-revolutionary restoration.

The Chinese Khrushchev vigorously promotes the theory of "extinguishing class struggle" to boost the morale of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. The harder the Chinese Khrushchev pushes, the more the ghosts and monsters jump around. Since 1962, the Chinese Khrushchev, through his agent Wang Renhe in Hubei, has vigorously promoted "three freedoms and one contract" and "work points as the key." The landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in our brigade have openly launched a fierce attack on the poor and lower-middle peasants, engaging in counter-revolutionary restoration activities. They openly shout about "cultivating the land themselves and eating it themselves," and want the production teams to "contract the fields to households." They engage in large-scale deforestation and destruction of collective economy. They sell state and collective property, engaging in large-scale speculation. They engage in counter-attacks and revenge, keeping "change of heaven" accounts. The class enemies even want to seize the leadership of the production teams to achieve their evil goal of counter-revolutionary restoration. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, many evil facts of the class enemies' counter-revolutionary restoration activities have been exposed, further revealing the class enemies' wolfish ambitions to change the sky.

These shocking facts fully prove that Chairman Mao's teaching that "class struggle has not ended" is a great truth. The theory of "extinguishing class struggle" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev is nothing but a lie to deceive people, a smokescreen for his attempt to seize the party, seize political power, and restore capitalism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Never forget class struggle." The facts of class struggle in our brigade show that class struggle has not stopped for a single moment. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings and never forget class struggle.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, militiamen, and revolutionary cadres in our brigade have persistently carried out revolutionary criticism and criticism, thoroughly criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies such as the theory of "extinguishing class struggle." In recent periods, we have also exposed the counter-revolutionary restoration activities of the class enemies in our brigade, greatly enhancing the class struggle consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, militiamen, and revolutionary cadres. We must never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to put politics in command, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We must resolutely criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    要念念不忘阶级斗争
    大队党支部书记　翁存福
    伟大领袖毛主席谆谆教导我们，在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，“被推翻的地主买办阶级的残余还是存在，资产阶级还是存在，小资产阶级刚刚在改造。阶级斗争并没有结束。”
    可是，中国赫鲁晓夫却同毛主席大唱反调。他叫嚷什么“现在国内敌人已经基本上被消灭，地主阶级早已消灭了，资产阶级也基本上消灭了，反革命也算是基本上消灭了。”按照中国赫鲁晓夫的说法，阶级消灭了，阶级斗争也没有了。这是对无产阶级和劳动人民的一副剧毒麻醉剂。
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，就是要我们忘掉阶级，忘掉阶级斗争，好让牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼，翻云覆雨，伺机变天，重新骑到我们贫下中农头上。事实上，我们大队从土改到现在，地、富、反、坏、右分子没有一天老实过，他们时刻盘算着翻天，梦想有朝一日实行反革命复辟。
    中国赫鲁晓夫竭力宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论，是为地、富、反、坏、右分子打气。中国赫鲁晓夫下劲越大，牛鬼蛇神蹦跶得越高。一九六二年以来，中国赫鲁晓夫通过他在湖北的代理人王任重，大肆鼓吹“三自一包”、“工分挂帅”，我们大队的地、富、反、坏、右分子就公开向贫下中农发动了猖狂的进攻，大搞反革命复辟活动。他们公开叫嚷什么“土地自己种，自己吃”，要生产队“把田包到户”。他们大搞毁林开荒，破坏集体经济。他们倒卖国家和集体的物资，大搞投机倒把活动。他们大搞反攻倒算，记“变天账”。阶级敌人还妄想篡夺生产队的领导权，实现反革命复辟的罪恶目的。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，揭发了阶级敌人进行反革命复辟活动的许多罪恶事实，更加暴露了阶级敌人妄想变天的狼子野心。
    这些触目惊心的事实，充分证明毛主席的“阶级斗争并没有结束”的教导，是千真万确的伟大真理。中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论不过是骗人的鬼话，是为他篡党、篡政、复辟资本主义服务的烟幕弹。
    毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。我们大队阶级斗争的事实说明，阶级斗争一刻也没有停息，我们要牢记毛主席的教导，念念不忘阶级斗争。
    无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，我们大队的广大贫下中农、民兵和革命干部，坚持开展了革命的大批判，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论等反革命修正主义谬论。最近一个时期，我们又揭发了本队阶级敌人的反革命复辟活动，大大提高了广大贫下中农、民兵和革命干部的阶级斗争观念。我们一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决把中国赫鲁晓夫彻底批倒批臭，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
