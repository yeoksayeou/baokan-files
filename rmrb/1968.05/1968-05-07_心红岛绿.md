The islands guarded by a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in the Yellow Sea number in the dozens, with the largest being only about twenty square kilometers and the smallest only half a square kilometer. The islands are covered with towering mountains and rolling hills, with the sea visible as soon as one steps outside, and rocks as far as the eye can see. The local people say, "Vegetables don't grow on the islands, just like the moon doesn't come out on the first day of the lunar new year—it's an old tradition." However, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, say, "No matter how difficult, Mao Zedong's soldiers will not be defeated!"

Plowing the land and planting vegetables on the islands was a hard-won battle. The Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing had attempted to use the bourgeois military line to transform the island-defending troops. Luo Ruiqing once visited the island and declared, "Don't plow the land and plant vegetables on the islands; it affects soil conservation. Vegetables will be supplied from the mainland; your task is military training. Soldiers eat rations, and the state supports the army!" The soldiers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, saw through the counter-revolutionary revisionists' plot. They intended to revise Chairman Mao's military line, to remove the soul of the People's Liberation Army's political construction, to lead the island-defending troops astray, making the army detached from politics, production, and the people. The soldiers were enraged and engaged in a head-on struggle with the counter-revolutionary revisionists. Luo Ruiqing emphasized "military first," so the soldiers insisted on political first, launching a wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, ensuring that no matter how tight the schedule or heavy the tasks, they would not be deterred. Luo Ruiqing forbade the troops from engaging in production, so the soldiers remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and insisted on being both a fighting force and a work and production team, clearing mountains, leveling hills, moving soil to create fields, building water conservancy projects, and planting vegetables and raising pigs.

On May 7, 1966, just as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was rising in our country, our great teacher issued the call for the army to be a "big school." Chairman Mao taught, "This big school should learn politics, military affairs, culture, and also engage in agricultural and sideline production." Chairman Mao's instructions greatly inspired all the soldiers guarding the islands. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching to "also participate in the cultural revolution to criticize the bourgeoisie at any time," launching a revolutionary criticism campaign. They spoke out and wrote to criticize the bourgeois military line mercilessly. At the same time, a mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought surged forward, raising the soldiers' boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao to a new level. Comrade Lin Biao said, "When the people grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they become the wisest and bravest, and can unleash boundless power!" Under the sun of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and guided by Chairman Mao's May 7th instructions, while fiercely attacking the bourgeois reactionary line, the soldiers guarding the islands also engaged in a great struggle with nature.

"Down the mountain, down the mountain, the red flag flutters like a painting." Labor sites hung portraits of Chairman Mao and boards with his quotations, with large banners and criticism columns. There were propaganda teams and singing groups on the construction sites. Songs of Chairman Mao's quotations and songs of learning from Dazhai echoed through the mountains. The Second Company of a certain unit, known as the "Dazhai in the military on the islands," was a model company in the struggle against nature. This company was stationed on a large hillside, surrounded by mountains on three sides and facing the sea on one side, with weeds and rocks everywhere. The soldiers of this company chopped rocks and managed to level out five neat "Dazhai fields" on a thousand three hundred square meters of hillside. In December, the weather was bitterly cold, with a biting north wind howling and blowing sand into people's faces. The soldiers said, "The wind is strong, but the power of Mao Zedong Thought is stronger. Island-defending soldiers must tread on difficulties and overcome them."

A certain island garrison company built terraces on a small island of less than two square kilometers, overcoming countless difficulties. On this small island, if you want to find rocks, you just need to bend down, but if you want to grab a handful of fine soil, it's as hard as panning for gold in sand. The island-defending soldiers, with red hearts facing the red sun, carried away rocks with their shoulders and opened up fields of various sizes and shapes with their hands. There were small fields like "chicken claw fields" and "square fields," and even "pumpkin fields" and "triangle fields." They didn't miss any rock crevices large enough to plant a pumpkin, and even piled soil on top of vegetable cellars to create "cellar fields." Some soldiers climbed dangerous peaks, tied soil baskets with ropes, and carried them up to create small vegetable gardens called "sky gardens."

To grow vegetables on the islands, the problem of water had to be solved. The islands have always lacked fresh water, and the local people say, "The waves are right under your feet, but you can't use the water." The soldiers said, "Mao Zedong's soldiers will make the mountains grow vegetables and the rocks offer water." During the dry season, the garrison camp on a certain island had to transport water from the mainland to drink. Where would they get water to irrigate the vegetables? They decided to dig wells. On an island of one square kilometer, they dug sixteen wells, built one water reservoir, and constructed over fifteen hundred meters of irrigation canals and over one hundred meters of overhead water channels. Some wells had no water at all. What to do? They diverted snowmelt and rainwater into the wells for storage. The comrades at the Red Flag Sentry Post on a certain island had to carry water from a mountain a kilometer away to irrigate the vegetables on the mountain, climbing a forty-five-degree slope and ascending four to five hundred stone steps. This path was named "Heavenly Path" by the soldiers. The soldiers said, "The mountain is high and the path is steep, but we are not afraid of the difficulties. Every drop of water nurtures the seedlings, and the soldiers' red hearts and resolve are even firmer!"

Last year, various islands suffered different degrees of wind and rain disasters. The soldiers defending the islands used Mao Zedong Thought to guide their battles, racing against time, competing for every seedling and row. If the seedlings were washed away several times, they would replant them several times.

People are red, and the islands can grow vegetables; the islands grow vegetables, and the people are even redder.

When the troops first arrived on the islands, all the vegetables and meat were supplied from the mainland. After the soldiers' hard work, they broke the old habit of not being able to grow a large amount of vegetables on the islands and achieved self-sufficiency in vegetables and meat. The variety of vegetables is similar to that on the mainland, with over thirty kinds of vegetables such as cucumbers, tomatoes, eggplants, and chilies.

The process from not being able to grow vegetables on the islands to being able to grow them is the process of the soldiers studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and the process of people achieving ideological transformation.

Over the past two years, batch after batch of revolutionary youth have come to the islands, shouldered with the glorious mission of defending the motherland. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and in this big school of the army, they have made continuous progress and growth, taking deep roots on the islands. Now, all the soldiers defending the islands are further implementing Chairman Mao's May 7th instructions with even greater enthusiasm, vowing to turn the islands into a red Mao Zedong Thought big school!

　　心红岛绿
　　遥塞　姚厚
    黄海前哨某部队守卫的岛屿有几十个，最大的不过二十多平方公里，最小的只有半平方公里。岛上群山矗立，峰峦起伏，出门是海，举目尽是石头。当地群众说：“岛上不长蔬菜，和正月初一不出月亮一样，是老规矩。”但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民解放军战士却说：“千难万难，难不倒毛主席的战士！”
    在海岛上开荒种菜，是经过一番斗争的。中国赫鲁晓夫以及反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿，曾企图用资产阶级的建军路线改造守岛的部队。罗瑞卿有次到了岛上，大放厥词：“不要在海岛上开荒种地，影响水土保持。”“吃菜由大陆上供应，你们的任务就是军训。”“当兵吃粮，国家兵国家养！”用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，识破了反革命修正主义分子的阴谋。他们是想篡改毛主席的建军路线，是想抽掉解放军政治建军的灵魂，是想把守岛部队引向邪路，使军队脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离人民。战士们愤怒了，同反革命修正主义分子进行了针锋相对的斗争。罗瑞卿强调“军事第一”，指战员们就要争政治第一，掀起活学活用毛主席著作的热潮，做到时间紧挤不掉，任务重压不倒。罗瑞卿不许部队搞生产，指战员们就牢记毛主席教导，一定做到既是战斗队，又是工作队、生产队，开山劈峰，移土造田，兴修水利，种菜养猪。
    一九六六年五月七日，正当我国无产阶级文化大革命兴起的时候，我们伟大的导师发出了“军队应该是一个大学校”的伟大号召。毛主席教导说：“这个大学校，要学政治，学军事，学文化，又能从事农副业生产”。毛主席的指示，极大地鼓舞着守卫海岛的全体指战员。他们遵照毛主席“又要随时参加批判资产阶级的文化革命斗争”的教导，开展了革命的大批判。人人口诛笔伐，对资产阶级建军路线进行了无情的批判。同时，一个活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，更波澜壮阔地兴起，把广大指战员无限忠于毛主席的感情提高到一个更新的境界。林彪副主席说：“人民群众掌握了毛泽东思想，就变得最聪明，最勇敢，就能发挥无穷无尽的力量！”守卫海岛的战士们，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，在毛主席“五·七”指示的指引下，在向资产阶级反动路线猛打猛冲的同时，又同大自然展开了一场大搏斗。
    “山下山下，风展红旗如画。”劳动现场上挂起毛主席画像和毛主席语录板，竖起了大标语牌和大批判专栏。工地上有宣传组、演唱组。毛主席语录歌，学大寨赶大寨的歌声在山间回荡……。被人称为“海岛军中大寨”的某部二连，就是战天斗地中的一个模范连队。这个连队驻在一个大山坡上，三面环山，一面临海，杂草丛生，乱石交错。这个连队的指战员，劈开石头，硬是在一千三百多平方米的山坡上垫起五块整整齐齐的“大寨田”。十二月份的天气，寒气逼人，刺骨的北风呼呼地刮着，卷起的风砂不停地打在人们的脸上。战士们说：“风大，没有毛泽东思想威力大，守岛战士就是要踩着困难走，顶着困难上。”
    某岛守备连在一个不足两平方公里小岛的鸡爪形高山上，修起一块块、一层层的梯田，不知流了多少汗水，克服了多少困难。在这个小岛上，你要找石头，弯腰就是，可是你要抓一把细土，简直比砂里淘金还难。守岛战士红心迎着红太阳，他们用双肩抬走了一块块巨石，用双手开出一块块大小不等、奇形怪状的地，小的有“鸡爪田”、“方块田”，还有什么“南瓜田”，“三角田”等等。就连能种一棵南瓜的石缝也不放过，连菜窖顶上也垫上土种菜，成了“菜窖田”。有的战士还攀上险峰，把土筐拴上绳子，一筐筐将土提上去，垫成小菜园，叫做“空中田”。
    要在海岛上种菜，必须解决水的问题。海岛上历来缺少淡水，当地群众说：“脚下就是浪，有水用不上。”战士们说：“毛主席的战士，定叫高山长菜，岩石献水。”驻某岛的守备营，干旱季节里吃的水都要去大陆上运，那里弄水浇菜呢！他们决心打井。在一平方公里的岛子上，他们打井十六眼，修水池一座，筑灌溉水渠一千五百多米长，架空中水道一百多米。有的井里根本没有水，怎么办呢？他们把雪水、雨水引到井里，储存起来。守备某岛的红旗哨所的同志，为了浇山上的菜，要到相隔千米的山下背水，爬四十五度的陡坡，攀登四五百个石阶，这条路被战士命名为“通天道”。战士们说：“山高峰险路通天，背水不怕路艰难，滴水入土催苗长，战士心红志更坚！”
    去年，各个海岛都受到不同程度的风灾、雨害。守岛的指战员们用毛泽东思想指挥自己去战斗，争分夺秒，争棵争行，秧苗被冲走几次就补种几次。
    人红海岛能长菜，海岛长菜人更红。
    部队刚到岛上的时候，吃的蔬菜、肉食，全靠大陆上供应。经过指战员们的奋战，打破了海岛上不能大量种菜的老习惯，实现菜肉自给。蔬菜的品种和大陆上差不多，可以吃到黄瓜、西红柿、茄子、辣椒等三十多种菜。
    从海岛不长菜到长菜的过程，就是指战员们活学活用毛泽东思想的过程，是人们实现思想革命化的过程。
    两年来，一批又一批的革命青年，肩负着保卫祖国的光荣使命来到海岛上，他们在毛泽东思想的阳光哺育下，在部队这座大学校里，不断进步，不断成长，在海岛上扎下了深根。现在，守卫海岛的全体指战员，正以更饱满的热情，进一步落实毛主席的“五·七”指示，誓把海岛办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校！
