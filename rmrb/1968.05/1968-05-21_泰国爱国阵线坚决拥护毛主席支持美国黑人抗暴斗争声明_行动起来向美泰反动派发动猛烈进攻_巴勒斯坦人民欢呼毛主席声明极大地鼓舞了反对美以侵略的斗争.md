The Thai Patriotic Front recently issued a statement, enthusiastically hailing and resolutely supporting Chairman Mao's statement on supporting the struggle of Black Americans against violence.

The Thai Patriotic Front's statement emphasized that Chairman Mao's statement is a brilliant document of great historical significance. This statement not only points out a bright future for the struggle of Black Americans but also indicates the correct direction for the struggle of the American people to achieve thorough liberation. It also points out the correct direction for the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world.

The statement said, the struggle of Black Americans against violence has dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialism, which is in trouble both at home and abroad. It has greatly supported and inspired the Vietnamese people, the Thai people, and the revolutionary people of the world who are fighting against U.S. imperialism. The statement said, the Thai people resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, and with practical actions support the struggle of their Black American brothers. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the Thai people will unswervingly carry the revolutionary armed struggle to the end.

The Thai Patriotic Front's statement called on all its members, other patriotic organizations, and the revolutionary people of Thailand to take action, launch fierce attacks on U.S. imperialism and the traitorous Thanom-Praphat clique, actively support and participate in the Thai people's revolutionary armed struggle led by the Communist Party of Thailand, and fight to the end to expel the U.S. aggressors and overthrow the traitorous Thanom-Praphat clique.

The Palestinian people, who are bravely fighting against the Israeli aggressors backed by the United States, warmly hail Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of Black Americans against violence as a beacon, which illuminates the path to victory for Black Americans and the revolutionary people of the world. It greatly inspires the struggle of the Palestinian people against U.S.-Israeli aggression.

Palestinian youth Aziz said, "The great teacher Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time." Chairman Mao's statement is a guide for the people of all countries in their struggle against imperialist forces led by U.S. imperialism. It "has great historical significance."

Palestinian youth Ahmad told a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "Chairman Mao's statement is a beacon, it not only points out the path to victory for Black Americans but also for the Palestinian people and the revolutionary people of the world."

He said, "Recently, more and more Palestinian youth, both men and women, have joined the armed struggle against the U.S.-Israeli aggressors. Armed struggle is the only way for the Palestinian people to liberate their homeland. 'Political solution' is a big deception that benefits the aggressive and expansionist policies of the United States and Israel." He pointed out, "The reactionaries who help the U.S.-Israeli aggressors to put pressure on us and force us to accept the 'political solution' only expose their role as the henchmen of U.S. imperialism."

He concluded, "We, the Palestinian people, are extremely grateful to Chairman Mao for the great support he has given to our just struggle. We wish Chairman Mao a long life!"

    巴勒斯坦人民欢呼毛主席声明极大地鼓舞了反对美以侵略的斗争
    新华社讯  据“泰国人民之声”电台十六日广播，泰国爱国阵线最近发表声明，热烈欢呼和坚决拥护毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。
  泰国爱国阵线的声明强调指出，毛主席的声明是一个具有重要历史意义的光辉文件。这个声明，不仅给美国黑人指出了斗争的光明前途，还给美国人民指出获得彻底解放的正确斗争方向，同时也给世界人民的革命斗争指出了正确的方向。
    声明说，美国黑人的抗暴斗争，沉重地打击了内外交困的美帝国主义，极大地支援和鼓舞了正在同美帝国主义进行斗争的越南人民、泰国人民和全世界革命人民。声明说，泰国人民坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，以实际行动给美国黑人兄弟的斗争以有力的支援。泰国人民在泰国共产党领导下，坚定不移地把革命武装斗争进行到底。
    泰国爱国阵线的声明呼吁它的全体成员、其它爱国组织以及泰国革命人民，行动起来，向美帝国主义和他侬—巴博卖国集团发动猛烈的进攻，积极支援和参加泰国共产党领导的泰国人民革命武装斗争，为驱逐美国侵略者和推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团斗争到底。
    新华社大马士革电　正在同美国支持下的以色列侵略者进行英勇的武装斗争的巴勒斯坦人民，热烈欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明是指路明灯，它照亮了美国黑人和世界革命人民胜利的道路，极大地鼓舞了巴勒斯坦人民反对美以侵略的斗争。
    巴勒斯坦青年阿齐兹说：“伟大导师毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者”。毛主席的声明是世界各国人民反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义势力的斗争的指南，它“具有伟大的历史意义”。
    巴勒斯坦青年艾哈迈德对新华社记者说：“毛主席的声明是指路明灯，它不仅向美国黑人而且也向巴勒斯坦人民和世界革命人民指出了走向胜利的道路。”
    他说：最近越来越多的巴勒斯坦男女青年参加了反对美以侵略者的武装斗争。武装斗争是巴勒斯坦人民解放家园的唯一道路。“政治解决”是有利于美国—以色列的侵略和扩张政策的大骗局。他指出：帮助美以侵略者对我们施加压力、迫使我们接受“政治解决”办法的反动派，只不过暴露了它充当美帝国主义帮凶的面目。
    他最后说：“我们巴勒斯坦人民万分感谢毛主席对我们的正义斗争所给予的伟大支持。我们敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
