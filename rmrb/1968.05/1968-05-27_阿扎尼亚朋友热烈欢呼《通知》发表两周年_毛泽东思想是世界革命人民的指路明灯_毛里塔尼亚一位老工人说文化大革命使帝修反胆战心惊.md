Friends from Azania (South Africa) and Mauritania recently enthusiastically celebrated the second anniversary of the issuance of the "Notice" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on May 16, 1966, and pointed out that the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is accelerating the end of imperialism.

On May 21, David Sibeko, the Deputy Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Director of Propaganda of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa), issued a statement in Dar es Salaam saying that the "Notice" formulated under the personal guidance of Chairman Mao Zedong is a landmark document that has brought China's revolution into a new era.

Sibeko pointed out that the "Notice" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China ensures that the People's Republic of China adheres to the Marxist-Leninist line, consolidates the dictatorship of the proletariat, and thus makes China a stronger bastion of anti-imperialist struggle.

He said: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has made all reactionaries tremble with fear, exposing the paper tiger nature of their existence, and accelerating the end of imperialism." Sibeko noted that the second anniversary of the issuance of the "Notice" coincides with the unprecedented surge in student and worker movements in Europe and North America. The students and workers in those countries, taking the Red Guards of China as their example, are challenging the monopoly capitalists in their own countries. He emphasized, "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for the revolutionary people of the world."

He concluded with the slogans: "Long live Mao Zedong Thought! Down with the monopoly capitalists of Europe and North America!"

An elderly worker in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania, praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, saying: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao is an unprecedented event in human history. It has made imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries tremble with fear. All true Marxists and upright people around the world are cheering for China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This elderly worker warmly wished the Chinese people greater achievements under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao. Finally, he shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

    新华社二十五日讯　阿扎尼亚（南非）和毛里塔尼亚朋友最近热情欢呼中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》发表两周年，并且指出史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命加速了帝国主义末日的到来。
    阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会外事副书记兼宣传主任戴维·西贝科二十一日在达累斯萨拉姆发表声明说，这个由毛泽东主席亲自主持制定的中共中央《通知》是一个划时代的文件，它使中国“革命进入一个崭新的时代”。
    西贝科指出，中共中央的《通知》，确保了中华人民共和国坚持马克思列宁主义路线，巩固了无产阶级专政，从而使中国成为一个更坚强的反帝斗争的堡垒。
    他说：“中国的文化大革命使一切反动派胆战心惊，把他们的纸老虎的本质暴露在人们面前，加速了帝国主义末日的到来。”西贝科指出，《通知》发表两周年的时候，正是欧洲和北美的学生和工人运动空前高涨的时候，那些国家的学生和工人们以中国的红卫兵为榜样，向本国的垄断资本家挑战。他强调说：“毛泽东思想是世界革命人民的指路明灯。”
    他最后高呼：“毛泽东思想万岁！”“打倒欧洲和北美的垄断资本家的斗争万岁！”
    毛里塔尼亚首都努瓦克肖特的一位老工人赞扬中国的无产阶级文化革命说：毛主席发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，是人类史无前例的大事，它使帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派胆战心惊。而全世界真正的马克思主义者和正直的人们，都为中国的文化大革命而欢呼。这位老工人热烈祝愿中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下取得更大的成就。最后，他高呼：“毛泽东主席万岁！万万岁！”
