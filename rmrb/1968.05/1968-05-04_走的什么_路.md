Title: What Path Are They Taking?

The reactionary film *Red River Waves* is another glaring example of how novels are used to oppose the Party. In the film, there is a line: "The path is one that we ourselves have forged." This clearly exposes the malicious intent of the film's creators.

The film opens with a deliberately arranged scene: Zhang Tiewa, the leader of a guerrilla unit, and another guerrilla member, Gao Feihu, are walking towards Nanliang, discussing as they go. Zhang Tiewa, full of himself, says to Gao Feihu, "The path is one that we ourselves have forged." This line, spoken through the mouth of Gao Gang's alter ego Zhang Tiewa, is a self-proclaimed declaration of the film's creators' anti-Party intentions.

"The path is one that we ourselves have forged." The film not only has Zhang Tiewa utter this line but also relentlessly promotes this idea throughout, attempting to make people believe that the revolutionary path was indeed forged by Zhang Tiewa himself. In the film, Zhang Tiewa is portrayed as the "founder" of the Red Army. Upon returning to his village, he calls upon the masses, saying, "Gao Feihu and I have returned to organize an armed force." The masses immediately support him, saying, "You lead us all." Thus, the Red Army is established under his leadership. It is also Zhang Tiewa who is depicted as the "pioneer" of the rural revolutionary base. He engages in a fierce struggle with the militia commander Yao Deyuan. Yao Deyuan says, "We must not let Zhang Tiewa establish a foothold," while Zhang Tiewa resolutely declares, "We must establish a foothold." In this way, a revolutionary base is "established" in the vast rural areas of northern Shaanxi.

The film also vigorously spreads the false notion of "northern Shaanxi saving the Central Committee," claiming that it was the Gao Gang anti-Party clique that cleared the way for the Red Army marching north to resist Japan. This portrays Gao Gang as the representative of the "correct line" in the Chinese revolution.

Was the path of the Chinese revolution forged by Gao Gang in 1935? This is a blatant lie. The ironclad facts of Chinese revolutionary history are as follows: As early as 1927, our great leader Chairman Mao personally led the Autumn Harvest Uprising, establishing the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. Subsequently, he led the troops to Jinggangshan, establishing a revolutionary government and creating the first rural revolutionary base. Chairman Mao's great practice and brilliant ideas about armed struggle, establishing rural revolutionary bases, and surrounding the cities from the countryside, shone like a beacon, illuminating the path of the Chinese revolution. The Jinggangshan path is the only correct path for the Chinese revolution. In January 1935, the historic Zunyi Conference established Chairman Mao's leadership over the entire Party and the entire army. From then on, the Chinese revolution advanced victoriously along the path indicated by Chairman Mao. Yet, the film distorts history, not mentioning Chairman Mao or the great Mao Zedong Thought from beginning to end. Instead, it portrays the anti-Party conspirator Gao Gang as the founder of the workers' and peasants' armed forces and rural revolutionary bases, shamelessly attributing Chairman Mao's historical achievements to the anti-Party element Gao Gang. This is despicable to the extreme!

Before 1935, what path did Gao Gang take in northern Shaanxi? The true historical record is that Gao Gang did not follow the correct line in northern Shaanxi but instead implemented Wang Ming's "Left" opportunist line. He relied solely on secret activities within the enemy's ranks and "inciting mutinies" to expand his forces, rarely mobilizing and arming the masses, and never establishing a solid base. Instead, he wandered aimlessly, practicing banditry. The path Gao Gang took brought great losses to the northern Shaanxi revolution, plunging it into a serious crisis. It was Chairman Mao who led the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army to successfully complete the Long March, fundamentally saving the Chinese revolution and the northern Shaanxi base. The film desperately tries to glorify Gao Gang, turning a traitor into a hero, attempting to rehabilitate Gao Gang. This plot will never succeed.

The film's attempt to rehabilitate Gao Gang is not just for the sake of a dead man but ultimately to create public opinion for the Chinese Khrushchev's plot to usurp the Party, the army, and the country. The film was produced in 1962, aligning with the black wind of rehabilitation led by the Chinese Khrushchev that year, aiming to stir up waves of capitalist restoration. The film also deliberately uses Zhang Tiewa's catchphrase, "playing the piano badly, lacking cultivation," to repeatedly praise the Chinese Khrushchev's black book of bourgeois business, *Cultivation*. It seems that with this black book of *Cultivation*, one would have the correct guiding ideology and would not "play the piano badly." However, the Chinese Khrushchev's poisonous book, *Cultivation*, was also mass-produced and distributed in 1962. The coordination between them is so tight! This fully shows that the film's creators insist on taking the anti-Party, anti-socialist path, the capitalist path of the Chinese Khrushchev. This is the true intention behind "The path is one that we ourselves have forged"!

"The Chairman loves the people, he is our guide. To build a new China, hooray, he leads us forward." The lyrics of this segment from the song *The East Is Red* best express our sentiments! Chairman Mao is the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman of the Chinese revolution. In every stage and turning point of the Chinese revolution, it was Chairman Mao who pointed out the correct path forward, leading the revolution to victory. Currently, Chairman Mao has shown us the path of continuing the revolution under the historical conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, indicating the path of socialist revolution and construction, and pointing out the bright road to communism. We must closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao, carry out the struggle between the two paths to the end, thoroughly smash the Chinese Khrushchev's plot to take the capitalist road, and resolutely sweep away all obstacles set up by all counter-revolutionary two-faced individuals and conspirators on our path forward. We will forever advance victoriously along the path indicated by Chairman Mao!

### 走的什么“路”

　　走的什么“路”
　　空直机关　红雷
    反动影片《红河激浪》，是利用小说进行反党的又一个活标本。影片中有一句话：“路是自己走出来的”，它明显地暴露了影片炮制者的险恶用心。
    影片一开场，就出现了一个特意安排的镜头：游击队长张铁娃和另一个游击队员高飞虎，两人在走向南梁的路上边走边谈，张铁娃神气十足地对高飞虎说：路是自己走出来的。这句话是通过高岗的化身张铁娃的嘴吐出来的，这正是影片炮制者蓄意反党的自我表白。
      “路是自己走出来的”，影片不仅让张铁娃说出了这句话，而且整个影片从头至尾都在狂热地吹捧这一思想，力图使人相信革命的路似乎真是张铁娃自己走出来的。影片中，张铁娃居然成了红军的“创始者”，他一回到村子里就对群众号召说：“我和飞虎回来，就是搞武装的”，群众马上拥护：“你领着大伙干吧”。于是，红军武装就在他的领导下建立起来了。又是这个张铁娃，成了农村革命根据地的“开辟者”，是他同民团司令姚德元进行了艰苦的斗争。姚德元说：“决不能叫张铁娃站稳脚跟”，而张铁娃斩钉截铁表示：“我们一定要站稳脚跟”，就这样在陕北广大农村“开辟了根据地”。
    影片还极力散布“陕北救中央”的谬论，宣扬是高岗反党集团扫荡敌人的据点，“为北上抗日的红军扫清前进的道路”。把高岗打扮成中国革命“正确路线的代表者”。
    难道中国革命的路是高岗在一九三五年才自己走出来的吗？这真是弥天大谎。中国革命历史的铁的事实是：早在一九二七年，我们伟大领袖毛主席就亲自领导了秋收起义，建立了中国工农红军；接着，又率领部队进军井冈山，建立了革命政权，创造了第一个农村革命根据地。毛主席开创的关于武装斗争、建立农村革命根据地、以农村包围城市的这一伟大实践和光辉思想，就象光芒万丈的灯塔，照亮了中国革命的道路。井冈山的道路就是中国革命唯一正确的道路。一九三五年一月，具有伟大历史意义的遵义会议确立了毛主席在全党、全军的领导地位，从此中国革命就沿着毛主席指引的道路胜利前进。而影片却颠倒历史，从头至尾一字不提伟大领袖毛主席，一字不提伟大的毛泽东思想，反而把反党野心家高岗打扮成工农武装和农村革命根据地的创始人，公然把伟大领袖毛主席的历史功绩统统记在反党分子高岗头上，这真是卑鄙无耻到了极点！
    一九三五年前，高岗在陕北究竟走的什么路？历史的本来面目是，高岗在陕北执行的根本不是正确路线，而是王明的“左”倾机会主义路线。他单纯地依靠在敌军内部搞秘密活动和“策动兵变”来扩大队伍，很少发动和武装人民群众，根本不建立牢固的根据地，而是东奔西闯，搞流寇主义。高岗走的这条路，给陕北革命带来了重大损失，使陕北面临着严重危机。是毛主席率领中国工农红军胜利完成了二万五千里长征，从根本上挽救了中国革命，挽救了陕北根据地。影片拚命往高岗的脸上抹金，把叛徒打扮成英雄，妄图为高岗翻案，这个阴谋是绝对不能得逞的。
    影片为高岗翻案，其目的当然不仅是为了高岗这个死人，归根到底，是给中国赫鲁晓夫篡党篡军篡国制造舆论。影片是一九六二年炮制出笼的，它为中国赫鲁晓夫在那一年带头掀起的翻案黑风摇旗呐喊，就是为了掀起资本主义复辟的恶浪。影片还特意通过张铁娃的口头禅“乱弹琴，没修养”，一再吹捧中国赫鲁晓夫那本资产阶级生意经黑《修养》，好象有了黑《修养》，就有了正确指导思想，就不会“乱弹琴”了。而中国赫鲁晓夫的大毒草黑《修养》一书，也正好是一九六二年大量再版发行的，这其间的配合呼应，何其紧密乃尔！这就充分表明影片炮制者执意要走反党反社会主义的路，要走中国赫鲁晓夫的资本主义的路，这就是所谓“路是自己走出来的”真实用意！
      “毛主席，爱人民，他是我们的带路人。为了建设新中国，呼儿咳哟，领导我们向前进。”歌曲《东方红》这一段歌词，最好不过地表达了我们的心声！毛主席是中国革命的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手。在中国革命的每个发展阶段、每个转折关头，都是毛主席指出了正确的前进道路，使革命得到了胜利的发展。在目前，毛主席又给我们指出了在无产阶级专政的历史条件下，继续革命的道路，指明了社会主义革命和建设的道路，指明了通向共产主义的光明大道。我们一定要紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，把两条道路的斗争进行到底，彻底粉碎中国赫鲁晓夫走资本主义道路的阴谋，坚决扫除一切反革命两面派、阴谋家设置在我们前进道路上的种种障碍，永远沿着毛主席指引的道路胜利前进！
