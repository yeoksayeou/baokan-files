The revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary workers of the Qin Huangdao Port Bureau in Hebei, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the port, have taken class struggle as the key link, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," making the revolutionary and production situation very good. After fully overfulfilling the national transportation plan in March this year, they also overfulfilled the port's various transportation tasks four days ahead of schedule in April.

Qin Huangdao Port is one of the important ports in northern China. A handful of class enemies within the port, in order to achieve the goal of sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, spread counter-revolutionary economism in every possible way among the workers, creating accidents of delaying trains, ships, and goods, and sabotaging the revolution and production. Facing this serious class struggle fact, the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the port and the broad revolutionary workers together studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, and conducted a class education of recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness. The broad masses of workers heightened their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to give a powerful counterattack to the enemies of the proletarian revolution.

The transportation team is one of the key units of the port bureau. The revolutionary workers of this team exposed the crimes of the class enemies who, in order to sabotage the port transportation, created "three slownesses" (slow shift handover, slow coal and water supply for locomotives, slow maintenance and repair) in the transportation team, causing delayed train accidents. The workers said: Grasp revolution, promote production, is the glorious task entrusted to us, the working class, by Chairman Mao, and is Chairman Mao's greatest trust in us. We must always be vigilant against the sabotage plots of the class enemies and resolutely ensure the full implementation of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." They turned "three slownesses" into "three quicknesses," making the number of locomotives leaving the platform more than double that of the past, greatly improving the transportation efficiency. After the counter-revolutionary economism wind was smashed, a handful of class enemies again used the bourgeois factionalism in the mass organizations to incite the masses to fight against each other, directing the spearhead at the great People's Liberation Army. The broad revolutionary workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with the help of the PLA, timely saw through the enemy's plot and exposed the enemy's crimes of attacking the PLA.

The broad revolutionary workers brought the boundless enthusiasm released in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production, launching a high tide of "grasp revolution, promote production." The number one wharf, which has the largest throughput in this port, needs major repairs. The port workers, in order to better complete the task of supporting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide and the world revolutionary struggle, with the help of the PLA, actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, braved the cold, and fought day and night. The original plan was to complete the repairs in twenty days, but it was actually completed in sixteen days. The broad masses of workers also followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "thrift for revolution," paying attention to thrift everywhere. In the past, when dredging the channel, the mud and sand were all thrown into the sea. Recently, they found that most of the mud and sand dug out were coal, so they brought it ashore. Now, they have already selected more than 220 tons of coal.

　　抓革命促生产形势一片大好
　　秦皇岛港务局提前完成四月份运输任务
　　职工们说：抓革命，促生产，是毛主席交给我们工人阶级的光荣任务，是毛主席对我们的最大信任
    新华社石家庄五日电  河北秦皇岛港务局的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，在驻港人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，以阶级斗争为纲，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，使革命和生产形势一片大好。在今年三月份全面超额完成国家运输计划之后，四月份又提前四天超额完成了港口各项运输任务。
    秦皇岛港是我国北方的重要港口之一，港里的一小撮阶级敌人为了达到破坏无产阶级文化大革命的目的，千方百计在职工中煽动反革命经济主义妖风，制造压车、压船、压货事故，破坏革命和生产。面对这一严重的阶级斗争事实，驻港的解放军毛泽东思想宣传队和广大革命职工一起，学习了毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的教导，进行忆苦思甜的阶级教育。广大职工提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，以毛泽东思想为武器，给无产阶级革命的敌人以有力的回击。
    运输队是港务局的关键单位之一。这个队的革命职工揭露了阶级敌人为了破坏港口运输，在运输队制造“三慢”（交接班慢、机车上煤上水慢、维护检修慢），造成压车事故的罪行。职工们说：抓革命，促生产，是毛主席交给我们工人阶级的光荣任务，是毛主席对我们的最大信任。我们必须时刻警惕阶级敌人的破坏阴谋，坚决保证毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针全面落实。他们把“三慢”变成“三快”，使机车出车台数比过去增加了一倍多，大大提高了运输效率。反革命经济主义的妖风被粉碎以后，一小撮阶级敌人又利用群众组织中的资产阶级派性，挑动群众斗群众，把矛头指向伟大的中国人民解放军。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命职工在解放军的帮助下，及时识破了敌人的阴谋，揭露了敌人攻击解放军的罪行。
    广大革命职工把无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲，运用到生产中去，掀起“抓革命，促生产”的高潮。这个港口吞吐量最大的一号码头需要大修，港口职工为了更好地完成支援全国无产阶级文化大革命和世界革命斗争的任务，在解放军的帮助下，活学活用毛主席著作，冒着严寒，日夜奋战，原计划二十天修好，结果只用十六天就修好了。广大职工还遵照毛主席的“要节约闹革命”的教导，处处注意节约。过去挖航道，都是把挖出来的泥沙抛在海里，最近他们发现挖出来的泥沙大部分是煤，就把它弄到岸上，现在已经选出了煤炭二百二十多吨。
