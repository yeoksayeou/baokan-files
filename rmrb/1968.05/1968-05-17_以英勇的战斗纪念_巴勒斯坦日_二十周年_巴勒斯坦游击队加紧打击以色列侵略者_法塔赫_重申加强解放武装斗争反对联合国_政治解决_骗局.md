Palestinian guerrillas have intensified their attacks on Israeli invaders to commemorate the 20th anniversary of "Palestine Day." The "Fatah" reaffirms the strengthening of armed struggle for liberation and opposes the United Nations' "political solution" deception.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Damascus on the 15th, Palestinian guerrillas have intensified their attacks on the enemy in the first half of May to commemorate the 20th anniversary of "Palestine Day." They have launched more than 30 attacks on Israeli invaders, killing and wounding over 300 Israeli soldiers, destroying two tanks, two armored vehicles, five half-track vehicles, and 19 other types of military vehicles.

According to a recent statement from the Palestinian nationalist organization "Fatah," in early May, the "Storm" commando unit launched a series of attacks on the West Bank of the Jordan River, achieving many victories. On the evening of May 3rd, the guerrillas destroyed a section of the road between Bethlehem and Al-Taas, destroying an enemy patrol car and killing all five occupants. That same night, the guerrillas used rockets to attack the enemy's military command center in the Jenin area, destroying several military vehicles and killing many invading soldiers.

On the evening of the 11th, the guerrillas ambushed an enemy patrol car near the village of Ola, killing five invaders. On the morning of the 12th, the guerrillas attacked the enemy in the north of Karantal Mountain. The Israeli invaders hastily dispatched three helicopters for reinforcement. After killing and wounding 12 invaders, the guerrillas safely retreated to the mountains.

On the evening of the 3rd, the guerrillas attacked the enemy near Zara, killing many Israeli invaders and destroying one military vehicle.

They killed 12 Israeli soldiers and wounded 8, destroying one half-track vehicle and three military vehicles.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Baghdad on the 15th, the Palestinian nationalist organization "Fatah" reaffirmed on the 14th that the Palestinian people are determined to continue strengthening their armed struggle to return to their homeland and oppose all "political solutions."

"Fatah" issued a statement in Beirut on the eve of the 20th anniversary of the U.S. imperialist tool's occupation of Palestine, saying: "We reject all United Nations resolutions on the Palestinian issue, including the 1948 resolution on the partition of (Palestine) and the resolution of the United Nations Security Council on November 22 last year." The statement expressed, "Fatah" rejects all "political" solutions proposed by the United Nations "envoy" Jarring. The statement said, "We reject all methods that limit the Palestinian people's struggle to liberate their homeland."

The statement said that the Palestinian people are "determined to continue the revolution," to "continue to develop and strengthen the struggle," "until Palestine is liberated and the people can return to their homeland."

To liberate Palestine from the occupation of Israeli invaders, the statement called for the realization of national unity among the Palestinian people and urged Arab countries to support the Palestinian struggle.
