	Only with Mao Zedong Thought Can We Have the Greatest Enthusiasm
	Brigade Party Secretary, Li Chengfu

	How can we mobilize the peasants' enthusiasm for production? Chairman Mao has long taught us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Vice Chairman Lin has pointed out: "When Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses, it will become an inexhaustible force, a mighty spiritual atomic bomb." However, the Chinese Khrushchev maliciously said in 1962: "During the transitional period, all methods that are beneficial to mobilizing the peasants' enthusiasm for production can be used. We should not say which method is the best and the only one." This is sheer nonsense. These are two fundamentally different kinds of enthusiasm. Using methods that emphasize proletarian politics can mobilize socialist enthusiasm; using methods that emphasize bourgeois politics can only mobilize enthusiasm for taking the capitalist road.

	What kind of enthusiasm does the Chinese Khrushchev want to mobilize? The cadres and members of our brigade have a deep understanding of this. After the "three freedoms and one contract" black wind blew in 1962, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in our brigade immediately applauded. They turned large areas of afforested land and riverbanks into their personal "wastelands." A wealthy peasant household with a strong tendency towards spontaneous capitalism stopped working for the collective, leading the whole family to go up the mountain to open up more than ten mu of wasteland, using the grain they harvested to engage in large-scale speculation. From this, we clearly see that the "three freedoms and one contract" aims to mobilize enthusiasm for taking the capitalist road. The higher this "enthusiasm," the faster capitalist restoration will be.

	Chairman Mao pointed out that poor and lower-middle peasants have "great socialist enthusiasm." To fully mobilize socialist enthusiasm, we must thoroughly eliminate the poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev's "three freedoms and one contract." Last year, with the help of the PLA Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, we held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carried out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, and launched a mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and members enthusiastically worked for the revolution. Everyone's thoughts turned to the collective, and their efforts were directed towards the collective. Even a seventy-year-old grandmother eagerly went to the fields to pick up stones and went deep into the mountains to carry leaves to make fertilizer for the collective. It is with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that we achieved an unprecedented agricultural bumper harvest, with grain production exceeding the historical highest level of 1957 by more than 50,000 jin. Especially the second production team, which was the most backward in the past, carried out the best criticism last year, had the least wasteland, and the highest collective yield, increasing production by more than 50% compared to 1966. This fully proves that when the masses grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they have boundless socialist enthusiasm.

	We must insist on carrying out the mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, insist on "criticizing revisionism and combating selfishness," continuously raise the socialist consciousness of the members, and give full play to greater revolutionary enthusiasm to promote the continuous development of socialist production.

### 靠毛泽东思想才有最大的积极性

　　靠毛泽东思想才有最大的积极性
　　大队党支部书记　李成福
    用什么办法调动农民的生产积极性呢？毛主席早就教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”林副主席指出：“毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”可是中国赫鲁晓夫却在一九六二年别有用心地说：“过渡时期一切有利于调动农民生产积极性的办法都可以。不要说那一种办法是最好的，唯一的。”这真是胡锄乱耪。这是两种根本不同的积极性。用突出无产阶级政治的办法，就能调动起社会主义的积极性；用突出资产阶级政治的办法，只能调动起走资本主义道路的积极性。
    中国赫鲁晓夫要调动的是什么积极性，我们大队的干部、社员是深有体会的。一九六二年，中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”的黑风刮起来后，我们大队的地、富、反、坏、右分子，立刻拍手叫好。他们把大片育林区、河滩，都开成了个人的“小荒地”。有一户资本主义自发倾向比较严重的富裕农民，放下集体活不干，带领全家老少上山开荒十多亩，把收的粮食拿去大搞投机倒把活动。从这里我们清楚地看出“三自一包”所要调动的正是走资本主义道路的积极性。这种“积极性”越高，资本主义复辟越快。
    毛主席指出，贫农、下中农有“极大的社会主义的积极性”。要充分调动社会主义积极性，就必须彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“三自一包”的流毒。去年，我们大队在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，深入持久地开展革命大批判，掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动。广大贫下中农和社员为革命种田的积极性充分调动起来了，大家心往集体想，劲往集体使，连七十多岁的老太太也争着下地拣石头，到深山背树叶为集体沤肥。我们就是这样靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想夺取了前所未有的农业大丰收，粮食产量比历史上最高的一九五七年还多五万余斤。尤其是第二生产队，过去最落后，去年大批判搞得最好，小荒地种的最少，集体地产量最高，比一九六六年增产了百分之五十以上。这充分说明，群众掌握了毛泽东思想，就有无穷的社会主义积极性。
    我们要坚持开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，坚持“斗私，批修”，不断提高社员的社会主义觉悟，发挥更大的革命干劲，促进社会主义生产不断发展。
