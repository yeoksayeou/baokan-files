At the Jiangxi Electric Machinery Factory, one often sees a thin middle-aged cadre in ordinary clothes, always in the workshops with the workers, studying and working together. When you visit him, he always opens his "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and tells you with deep emotion: "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant.' I have read this many times before, but I did not truly understand it. It was only during this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, that I truly understood the great truth that 'the masses are the real heroes.' The great revolutionary mass movement has established an immortal historical merit!"

This middle-aged cadre is Chen Taihe, the chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Electric Machinery Factory and former secretary of the factory party committee.

Recently, we visited Chen Taihe and asked him to share how he gradually came to understand Chairman Mao's great teaching that "the masses are the real heroes." Below is Chen Taihe's account:

From Not Understanding to Gradually Understanding

For a long time, I did not pay attention to transforming my worldview, became detached from the masses, and thus could not correctly handle my relationship with the masses and mass movements. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, faced with the impact of the revolutionary mass movement, I went from fearing the masses to actively executing the capitalist reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, suppressing the revolutionary masses. When the broad revolutionary masses stood up to expose and criticize my mistakes, I still harbored resentment and was not convinced. The revolutionary masses criticized me for executing a capitalist reactionary line, but I retorted: "I, Chen Taihe, have two shoulders and a head, I am a proletarian coming and going, I am executing the proletarian revolutionary line!"

I was indignant, and the proletarian revolutionary masses in the factory were also very angry. However, they acted according to Chairman Mao's policy for cadres, conducted a class analysis and comprehensive investigation of me, and determined that I was a cadre who had made mistakes but was still a revolutionary. With the broad vision of liberating all of humanity, they were determined to help me return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. I left the factory and went to the streets to read big-character posters, drawing lessons from the mass revolutionary criticism throughout society. The revolutionary masses in the province and city, in their fierce attacks on the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangxi, exposed a large number of shocking class struggle facts, which shocked me deeply. Under the poisonous influence of the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "class struggle extinguished," I believed that after the basic victory of socialism, the main task was to concentrate on improving production and construction, which was wrong. From this, I began to understand the most dangerous enemy under the dictatorship of the proletariat is the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, and I started to have a new understanding of the revolutionary mass movement.

At this time, the revolutionary masses in our factory used big-character posters to publish an open letter to the entire factory, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to systematically expose and criticize the capitalist reactionary line I had executed. The letter, in conjunction with the facts of class struggle and line struggle in society, posed a series of thought-provoking questions to me. This made me blush with shame, sweat, and suddenly realize that I had not been working for socialism but had been standing on the capitalist side, working for capitalism, becoming a tool for the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangxi to suppress the revolutionary masses, and committing errors in direction and line.

While deeply regretting my mistakes, I resolutely stood up and angrily fired at the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangxi, publicly breaking with the capitalist reactionary line. At this time, I began to taste the sweetness of the great revolutionary mass movement.

From Oil-and-Water Relationship to Fish-and-Water Relationship

The mass revolutionary criticism movement made me strongly desire to transform my worldview.

In recent years, I was busy every day, with business as the priority, not studying Chairman Mao's works well, not holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and not emphasizing proletarian politics. I thought that this time I must thoroughly examine and summarize my experiences and lessons. So I closed the door and reflected. I thought and wrote all day, writing more than thirty big-character posters for self-criticism. But after posting them, the revolutionary masses thought I had not truly found the root cause of my mistakes. They said: "You are a worker-turned Communist Party member saved by Chairman Mao from the sea of suffering. Why, in the fierce struggle between the two lines, could you not execute Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line?" They also sent me Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "You must have politics in command, go to the masses, be with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better."

Under the enlightenment and help of the revolutionary masses, I carried "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, visiting every workshop and small group in the factory, actively seeking opinions, and humbly listening to the masses' criticisms. Many revolutionary masses, including those who had been persecuted by me, warmly received me, had heart-to-heart talks, and seriously criticized me, using Mao Zedong Thought to help me deeply excavate the root causes of my mistakes, causing a real revolution in my soul that I had never experienced before.

In the second workshop, there was an old worker who had been persecuted by the capitalist reactionary line I had executed. When I went to apologize to him, I was a bit timid in my thoughts. However, to my surprise, the old worker first conducted self-criticism when he saw me. He sincerely said to me: "We are all bitter gourds on the same vine. You are a cadre, and I am a worker. Originally, we should have a fish-and-water relationship. You made mistakes, and I was not patient enough in helping you, which shows I have selfishness and lack Mao Zedong Thought in my mind. You, having become an 'official,' forgot your roots, seriously detached from the masses, feared the masses, and became an oil-and-water relationship. In the future, you must learn from this lesson!"

The old worker's words struck me deeply, making me feel both warm and painful.

My father was a worker and died when I was three. My mother died when I was five. At fourteen, I was sent to a workshop as an apprentice. At sixteen, I worked as a cook in a traditional Chinese medicine shop. During that Mid-Autumn Festival, I carried a heavy iron pot with boiling meat to the hall for the capitalists to eat. When I stepped down the stairs, I slipped, and the pot and meat soup spilled on my feet, burning them badly. I still couldn't escape a scolding. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, I found the Party and joined the revolution, becoming a member of the Communist Party of China. Due to the Party's cultivation and the needs of the revolutionary cause, I became a cadre. However, with the changes in the environment and position, I gradually forgot the great teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao: "Communist Party members must not detach from the masses, must not stand above the masses, act as officials and lords, but should appear before the masses as ordinary laborers, immerse themselves among the masses, and blend with the masses." However, the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "joining the Party to become an official" unknowingly took effect in my mind. I began to act like an official. The office was furnished with luxurious sofas and high-grade tea sets. I also became arrogant, liking to scold people. One year, our factory accepted a batch of electric machine repair tasks. I, wanting to be quick, decided without investigation and research that six workshops would each take a share of the tasks. The workers proposed different opinions to me. I not only did not listen but also scolded them: "I am the party committee secretary. Should I listen to you or to me!" Thus, the masses no longer dared to raise issues with me, and no longer wanted to discuss things with me. My relationship with the masses also became an oil-and-water relationship.

I found the cause of my mistakes and had a clearer direction for my future path.

From Believing in Myself to Believing in the Masses

After returning to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, after a period of observation and testing, the revolutionary masses actively supported me in taking on the revolutionary responsibilities. Should I boldly stand out, or should I hesitate? Faced with this new test, my thoughts fluctuated again. I thought, after the mass criticism, all my mistakes were exposed to the masses. If I continue to work, will I have any authority? Moreover, the responsibilities are heavy, the burden is heavy, if I make mistakes again, the new and old accounts will be settled together, and I can't bear it. It's better to transfer my job position and not take risks anymore. Therefore, when I learned that the revolutionary masses wanted to elect me as the head of the factory revolutionary committee, I was depressed on one hand and secretly went to the municipal revolutionary committee on the other, preparing to ask the organization not to approve me as the chairman. I thought on the way: Will the masses suspect that I still have some unresolved grievances? Thinking of this, I turned back and did not go.

All this, the revolutionary masses saw it in their eyes and worried in their hearts, and they patiently did ideological and political work on me.

The proletarian revolutionary masses in the factory, in the Mao Zedong Thought study class, studied and applied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with us cadres who were standing out. They fought against selfishness and criticism according to Chairman Mao's teachings, did not rely on past merits but established new achievements, which deeply moved me and educated me. I decided to overcome the selfish thoughts of fearing to make mistakes and fearing to take risks, bravely stand up to take on the heavy responsibilities of the revolution, and follow Chairman Mao's revolution to the end.

However, when I thought about whether the masses would still trust and support me, I hesitated again. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party, these are two fundamental principles. If you doubt these two principles, then you can't do anything." The revolutionary masses understood my active thoughts and pointed out to me: "You still haven't truly understood Chairman Mao's teachings, believing only in yourself and not fully in the masses. We previously 'cannon-fired' and 'fire-burned' you because you did not hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. If you truly decide to correct your mistakes and firmly act according to Mao Zedong Thought, we will definitely support you."

Under the help of the revolutionary masses, I finally jumped out of the small circle of "selfishness," got rid of worries such as "no authority" and "fear of not getting support," and continued to temper and transform myself in the storms of revolutionary struggle.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, work was complex, meetings were numerous, and things were many. I spent several days rarely going to the workshops. Some workers promptly criticized me: "We combine with you to make you combine with the masses, not to make you combine with the bench. Don't forget your old habits!" The revolutionary masses' criticism alerted me. The next morning, at the meeting of the revolutionary committee members studying Chairman Mao's works, I first conducted self-criticism and discussed with everyone the measures to combine with the masses.

Before and after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, our factory once experienced a wave of anarchism, with loose labor discipline and poor completion of production tasks. When I participated in labor in the second and fifth workshops, I studied with the worker masses Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle." Many old workers actively conducted reminiscences of bitterness and sweetness, conducting class education for young workers. The broad masses raised their class consciousness and line struggle consciousness, with red hearts and bright eyes, exposing the enemy's sabotage activities, cleansing the poison of counter-revolutionary economism, and waging a "people's war" against anarchism. Everyone's revolutionary enthusiasm soared, and production rose rapidly. After the factory revolutionary committee helped the second and fifth workshops summarize and promote this experience, it further promoted the cleansing of anarchist poison throughout the factory, making the revolution and production hot and lively.

The revolutionary spirit of the masses is constantly educating me, making me increasingly deeply feel that the power and wisdom of the masses are boundless, the masses are the real heroes. The great revolutionary mass movement is excellent! Only by constantly studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the storms of revolutionary struggle can we follow Chairman Mao and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

Chen Taihe, in concluding his speech, emotionally told us: "At present, a handful of class enemies are stirring up a rightist reversal wind, attempting to negate the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and negate the great revolutionary mass movement. We must increase our vigilance, sharpen our eyes, mobilize the broad revolutionary masses, and raise the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly smash this rightist reversal wind and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!"

　　伟大的群众运动好得很
　　江西电机厂革委会主任陈太和谈自己在文化大革命中受到的教育
    在江西电机厂里，经常可以见到一个瘦瘦身材，穿着普通服装的中年干部，成天在车间里和工人在一起，同学习，同劳动。当你去访问他时，他总是打开《毛主席语录》，无限感慨地告诉你：“毛主席教导我们：‘群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的。’过去我虽然读过许多遍，可是并没有真懂。在毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命中，我才真正懂得了‘群众是真正的英雄’这一伟大的真理，伟大的革命群众运动立下了不朽的历史功勋啊！”
    这个中年干部，就是电机厂革命委员会主任、前厂党委书记陈太和同志。
    不久前，我们访问了陈太和同志，请他介绍了他是怎样逐步懂得了毛主席关于“群众是真正的英雄”这一伟大教导的。下面是陈太和同志的谈话：
    从不理解到逐步理解
    较长时期以来，我由于不注意自己世界观的改造，脱离群众，因而不能正确地对待群众和群众运动。我在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，面对革命群众运动的冲击，由害怕群众发展到积极执行中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，压制无产阶级革命派。当广大革命群众起来揭发、批判我的错误时，我还“怨”字挡道，很不服气。革命群众批评我执行的是资产阶级反动路线，我顶撞说：“我陈太和两个肩膀扛个脑袋，来是无产阶级，去也是无产阶级，我执行的是无产阶级革命路线！”
    我赌气，厂里的无产阶级革命派也很生气。但是，他们照毛主席的干部政策办事，对我进行了阶级分析和全面调查，认定我是犯了错误的革命干部。他们以解放全人类的广阔胸怀，决心帮助我回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。我走出工厂，到大街上去看大字报，从社会上群众性的革命大批判中吸取教训。省、市革命群众在对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在江西的代理人发起的猛攻中，揭发出大量惊心动魄的阶级斗争事实，使我十分震惊。我在中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”论的毒害下，认为社会主义取得基本胜利以后，主要是集中力量搞好生产建设的认识是错误的。由此，对无产阶级专政条件下最危险的敌人是党内一小撮走资派，有了初步理解，对革命群众运动开始有了新的认识。
    正在这时，我们厂的革命群众，用大字报向全厂公布了给我的长篇公开信，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，系统地揭发、批判了我所执行的资产阶级反动路线。信中联系社会上的阶级斗争和路线斗争的事实，向我提出了一系列发人深省的问题。这使我脸上发烧，身上出汗，猛然醒悟到自己原来搞的不是社会主义，而是站在资产阶级立场上搞资本主义，充当了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在江西的代理人镇压革命群众的工具，犯了方向、路线的错误。
    我在痛心自己的错误的同时，坚决地站了起来，愤怒地向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在江西的代理人猛烈开火，公开同资产阶级反动路线决裂。这时，我开始尝到了伟大革命群众运动的甜头。
    从油水关系到鱼水关系
    群众性的革命批判运动，使我产生了改造世界观的强烈愿望。
    近几年来，我一天到晚忙忙碌碌，业务挂帅，没有好好学习毛主席著作，没有高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，没有突出无产阶级政治。我想，这次一定得好好检查、总结一下自己的经验教训。于是我就关起门来，闭门思过。我成天想呀，写呀，写了三十多张自我检查的大字报。可是贴出去以后，革命群众认为我还没有真正找到犯错误的根本原因。他们说：你是毛主席从苦海中解救出来的、工人出身的共产党员，为什么在两条路线的激烈斗争中，却不能执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线？他们还给我送来毛主席的最新指示：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”
    在革命群众的启发和帮助下，我带着《毛主席语录》和毛主席的最新指示，跑遍了全厂各个车间、小组，主动登门征求意见，虚心听取群众的批评。许多革命群众，包括那些受过我打击的革命群众，都对我热情接待，促膝恳谈，严肃批判，用毛泽东思想帮助我深挖犯错误的根源，使我在灵魂深处爆发了一场从未有过的真正的革命。
    第二车间有位老工人，曾经受过我执行的资产阶级反动路线的打击。我去找他赔礼道歉时，思想有些胆怯。可是，出乎意料，这位老工人见面倒先进行自我批评。他非常诚恳地对我说：“我们都是一根藤上的苦瓜。你当干部，我当工人，本来是鱼水关系。你犯了错误，我耐心帮助你很不够，这说明我有私心，脑子里还缺少毛泽东思想。你呀，就是当了‘官’，忘了本，严重脱离群众，害怕群众，跟群众成了油水不相沾的关系。今后可要接受教训啊！”
    老工人的一席话，有力地击中了我的要害。使我感到既亲切，又沉痛。
    我父亲是个工人，在我三岁时就死了。我五岁又死了母亲。我十四岁，就被送到一家作坊当徒工。十六岁又到一家中药铺当厨子。那年中秋节，我端着十多斤重的铁锅和沸腾的肉食到厅堂去给资本家们吃，下台阶时一失足，锅和肉汤全倒在脚上，脚被烫烂了，还逃不脱一顿毒骂。抗日战争胜利以后，我找到了党，参加了革命，加入了中国共产党。由于党的培养和革命事业发展的需要，我当了干部。但是，随着环境、地位的变化，我逐渐忘记了伟大领袖毛主席的伟大教导：“共产党员绝不可脱离群众，绝不可高踞于群众之上，做官当老爷，而应当以普通劳动者的姿态，出现在群众面前，深入于群众之中，同群众打成一片。”而中国赫鲁晓夫的“入党做官”论，却不知不觉地在我头脑中发生了作用。我开始摆官架子了。办公室里，沙发、高级茶具摆得很阔气。我还自以为是，喜欢训人了。有一年，我厂接受一批电机修理任务。我为了贪快，不经过调查研究，就轻率决定由六个车间各分担一部分任务。职工们向我提出不同的意见。我不仅不听，反而训了人家一顿：“我是党委书记，听你们的，还是听我的！”这样，群众有意见不肯对我提了，有事不愿跟我谈了。我同群众的关系，也就成了油水关系。
    我找到了自己犯错误的原因，对自己今后前进的道路，也有了较为明确的方向。
    从相信自己到相信群众
    当我回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来以后，经过一段观察和考验，革命群众又积极支持我出来担负起革命的重担。是大胆地挺身而出，还是畏缩不前？在这新的考验面前，我思想上又有了反复。我想，经过群众性的批判，我的一切错误都公布在群众面前，再干还会有威信吗？而且责任大，担子重，闹不好，再犯错误，新老账一起算，可吃不消，不如调动一下工作岗位，不要再冒风险了。因此，当我知道革命群众要选我担任厂革委会第一把手后，我一面态度消沉，一面悄悄到市革委会去，准备请求组织上不要批准我当主任。我一路走一路想：我这样做，群众会不会怀疑我有什么怨气未消除呢？想到这里，我又打了转身，不去了。
    所有这一切，革命群众都看在眼里，急在心里，他们对我又进行了耐心的思想政治工作。
    厂里的无产阶级革命派，在毛泽东思想学习班中，同我们这些正在站出来的干部一起，活学活用毛主席的最新指示。他们按照毛主席的教导斗私批修，不吃老本立新功，使我深受感动，教育很深。我决心斗倒怕再犯错误、怕冒风险的私心杂念，勇敢地站起来为革命挑重担，永远跟着毛主席革命到底。
    但是，当我想到群众还会不会信任、支持我时，我又犹豫起来。毛主席教导我们：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”革命群众摸透了我的活思想，一针见血地对我指出：“你还是没有真正懂得毛主席的教导，只相信自己，不太相信群众。我们过去‘炮打’、‘火烧’你，是因为你没有高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。如果你真正决心改正错误，坚决按毛泽东思想办事，我们一定会支持你的。”
    在革命群众的帮助下，我终于跳出了“私”字的小圈圈，摆脱了“没有威信”、“怕得不到支持”等等忧虑，继续在革命斗争的风雨中锻炼改造自己。
    革委会成立以后，工作千头万绪，会议多，事情多，我有几天很少下车间了。有的工人就及时对我提出了批评：“我们结合你，是要你同群众结合，不是要你同板凳结合。可不要忘了你的老毛病啊！”
    革命群众的批评，引起了我的警觉。第二天早上，我在革委会成员学习毛主席著作会上，首先进行了自我批评，并同大家一起讨论制定了联系群众的革命化措施。
    在革委会成立前后，我厂曾一度出现过无政府主义思潮，劳动纪律松弛，生产任务完成的不好。我到二、五车间参加劳动时，便同工人群众一起学习毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导。许多老工人主动地进行忆苦思甜，对年青工人进行阶级教育。广大群众提高了阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟，心红眼亮，纷纷起来揭发阶级敌人的阴谋破坏活动，肃清反革命经济主义的流毒，对无政府主义打了一场“人民战争”，大家的革命干劲倍增，生产上升很快。厂革委会帮助二、五车间总结、推广了这一经验后，又促进了全厂肃清无政府主义的流毒，革命和生产热气腾腾。
    革命群众的革命精神，在不断地教育着我，使我越来越深刻地体会到，群众的威力和智慧是无穷的，群众是真正的英雄。伟大的革命群众运动好得很！只有永远在革命斗争的风雨中活学活用毛泽东思想，才能紧跟毛主席，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    陈太和同志在结束他的谈话时，感情非常激动地对我们说：“当前，一小撮阶级敌人掀起一股右倾翻案黑风，妄图否定伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，否定伟大的革命群众运动。我们要加倍提高警惕，擦亮眼睛，发动广大革命群众，奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，彻底粉碎这股右倾翻案妖风，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”　本报记者
