    巴基斯坦新任外长重申
    克什米尔问题应按当地人民愿望解决
    新华社拉瓦尔品第十日电　阿尤布·汗总统七日在谈到外交政策时说，维护巴基斯坦的安全，是国家头等重要的任务。他是在对穆斯林联盟议会党团成员们发表讲话时说这番话的。
    新任命的巴基斯坦外交部长阿沙德·侯赛因八日在国民议会重申，克什米尔是有争议的领土，应当按照克什米尔人民的愿望予以解决。
    他在国民议会中答复问题时说，克什米尔问题仍然是印巴之间紧张局势的根源。柯西金访问巴基斯坦以后，克什米尔争端没有“搁置起来”。
    他还说，出席最近东南亚条约组织的巴基斯坦代表没有积极参加会议进程。巴基斯坦代表团没有参加联合公报的起草，对这方面的保留意见记入了公报。他说，巴基斯坦没有派代表参加东南亚条约组织部长会议之前举行的军事顾问会议。
