A platoon leader named Guo Huazhang from a certain unit supporting the left in the Huainan Coal Mine said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has fundamentally raised the political consciousness of the people. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, with a high sense of political responsibility as masters of the state, enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," making our country's socialist construction achieve a new upsurge. This is truly: The sun shines brightly over the red earth—

Delighted to See the Tide of Spring Surge in the Coal Sea

In the Huainan mining area, the coal army, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, day and night guards their battle stations. Above ground, they grasp revolution, and the revolutionary flames blaze; below ground, they promote production, and production surges like waves. The entire mine presents a vibrant and prosperous scene.

Huainan is a famous coal city in China. The two biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party had both come here, bare-chested, issuing black directives and making black reports. They peddled black goods like "bonus as the commander" and "material incentives," frantically pushing the revisionist enterprise management line, attempting to restore capitalism.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, shattered the pipedream of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the Huainan region. Big-character posters, denunciation meetings, criticism meetings, and Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with the momentum of "sweeping away thousands of troops like rolling up a mat," smashed to pieces the various revisionist systems that shackled the workers, and thoroughly criticized the stinking goods of "material incentives" and "bonus as the commander." The coal miners' horizons have broadened, their minds have expanded, and everyone is spirited and full of fighting spirit.

In the past, the Chinese Khrushchev used "bonus as the commander" and "material incentives" to shackle the socialist enthusiasm of the workers. A few workers had fallen for it. Some said, "As long as we earn more money, we don't care if the supports in the tunnels dance"; some rushed to good materials when they went to work, giving bad tools to others. Now, they have smashed the spiritual shackles that the Chinese Khrushchev put on them, releasing boundless revolutionary enthusiasm. Good deeds and good people emerge in endless streams. Some teams, seeing that a brother team was short of manpower, voluntarily sent people to help; some groups actively helped brother groups prepare materials, sending good materials to the working faces of brother groups; some workers went to work early to prepare production for the entire group. In production, the workers displayed a spirit of fearlessness of fatigue and continuous battle. An old worker named Zhou Xueshi from the excavation team of the No. 3 mine of the Xie mine did not listen to others' advice to rest when his clothes were soaked through with water during production; later, when gangue pressed on his body, others insisted he go down, but he still refused. He said, "Don't mind me, grasping revolution and promoting production is the most important!"

There was a worker surnamed Ju who, in the past, only cared about his small family. He rushed to meet deadlines at work to earn more money and took coal from the mine back home to save money. During the Cultural Revolution, he angrily denounced the poisoning of the Chinese Khrushchev and broadened his horizons. He realized that the "material incentives" of the Chinese Khrushchev were poisoned sugar-coated bullets, a breeding ground for the "selfish" character, and the root of "peaceful evolution." He said, "We, the working class, must liberate all of humanity, and first, we must liberate ourselves from the 'selfish' character." Breaking away from selfishness and establishing public-mindedness relies on the great thought of Mao Zedong and the "Three Articles." One night, he got up in the middle of the night, braved the wind and rain, and bought more than fifty copies of the "Three Articles" and more than sixty portraits of Chairman Mao from the city, distributing them to the workers. From then on, he always carried the "Three Articles" with him, always kept the three shining images of Zhang Zedong, Norman Bethune, and the old fool in his mind, and always used Chairman Mao's teachings of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people to examine his every word and deed. His revolutionary and productive enthusiasm grew even greater. After going down to the mine, he always picked the heaviest work. To produce more coal, he was not afraid of hard work and carefully picked out coal blocks when removing gangue.

Red flags fly over the hills of Ba Gong, and the coal city inside and out is bathed in morning light. Now, good news of production is frequently reported from various mines in Huainan, with production increasing day by day. The red flag team of the excavation team of the No. 1 mine of the Li mine has always insisted on making revolution in their spare time, completing their tasks ahead of schedule every month. In the first quarter of this year, they completed more than one and a half times their production tasks. Recently, the Datong mine achieved a record high of 2,500 tons per day since its establishment.

    在淮南煤矿支左的某部班长郭华长同志说：无产阶级文化大革命从根本上提高了人民的思想觉悟，广大无产阶级革命派以国家主人翁的高度政治责任感，热烈响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，使祖国社会主义建设出现了新的高涨。这真是：阳光普照大地红——
    喜看煤海春潮涌
    在淮南矿区，经过无产阶级文化大革命战斗洗礼的煤炭大军，日夜坚守在战斗岗位上。上井抓革命，革命烈火熊熊，下井促生产，生产逐浪高。全矿呈现出一派朝气蓬勃的大好景象。
    淮南是我国著名的煤城。党内两个最大的走资派，都曾经先后赤膊上阵，来到这里，发过黑指示，作过黑报告。他们大肆贩卖“奖金挂帅”、“物质刺激”等黑货，拚命推行修正主义的企业管理路线，妄图复辟资本主义。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在淮南地区代理人的黄粱美梦。一张张大字报，一次次声讨会、批判会，一个个毛泽东思想学习班，以“横扫千军如卷席”之势，把束缚工人的种种修正主义制度砸了个稀烂，把“物质刺激”、“奖金挂帅”等破烂货批得臭不可闻。煤矿工人眼界更开阔了，心胸更远大了，一个个精神振奋，斗志昂扬。
    过去，中国赫鲁晓夫用“奖金挂帅”、“物质刺激”等束缚工人的社会主义积极性，少数工人曾经上过当。有的“只要挣钱多，不管棚子（坑道里的支撑架）扭秧歌”；有的上工抢好料，把坏工具给别人。现在，他们砸烂了中国赫鲁晓夫加在他们身上的精神枷锁，焕发出冲天的革命干劲，好人好事层出不穷。有的队见兄弟队人手不够，就主动抽人去协助；有的组主动帮助兄弟组备料，把好材料送到兄弟组的作业面上；有的工人提前上班，替全组作好生产准备。在生产中，工人们发扬了不怕疲劳、连续作战的精神。谢三矿掘井一队老工人周学诗，生产时衣服被水淋透了，大家劝他休息，他不肯；后来，矸子压了他的身子，大家硬是要他下去，他还是不肯。他说：“不要管我，抓革命促生产要紧！”
    有一位姓菊的工人，过去心里只装着小家庭，上班赶进度，为了多挣钱，下班把矿上的煤拣回家，为了省钱。文化大革命中，他愤怒控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫对他的毒害，眼界开阔起来。他认识到：中国赫鲁晓夫的“物质刺激”，是裹着糖衣的砒霜，是培养“私”字的臭水沟，是“和平演变”的根子。他说：“我们工人阶级要解放全人类，首先要使自己从‘私’字里解放出来。”破私立公靠伟大的毛泽东思想，靠“老三篇”。有一天，他半夜起床，冒着风雨，从城里买回了五十多本“老三篇”，六十多幅毛主席像，分送给工人。从此，他随身带着“老三篇”，脑子里经常装着张思德、白求恩、老愚公三个光辉形象，经常用毛主席“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的教导来检验自己的一言一行。他革命和生产的干劲更大了。下井后，尽拣重活干。为了多出一块煤，他不怕劳累，出矸子时，细心地把煤块拣出来。
    八公山下红旗飘，煤城内外尽朝晖。现在，淮南各矿生产捷报频传，产量节节上升。李一矿掘进一队红旗小组始终坚持业余闹革命，月月超额完成任务，今年第一季度超额完成生产任务一倍以上。最近，大通矿以日产二千五百吨，创造了建矿以来的最高纪录。
