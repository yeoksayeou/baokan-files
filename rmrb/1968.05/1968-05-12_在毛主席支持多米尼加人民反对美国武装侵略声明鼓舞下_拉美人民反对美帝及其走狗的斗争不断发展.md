The struggle of the Latin American peoples against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys is developing continuously. Recently, the peoples of the Dominican Republic, Brazil, Chile, and some other Latin American countries have launched mass struggles of various forms and scales.

	Walking the Path of Armed Seizure of Power

The great leader of the world revolution, Chairman Mao, in his statement of May 12, 1965, supporting the Dominican people's opposition to U.S. armed invasion, gave tremendous support and inspiration to the revolutionary struggle of the Dominican people and all of Latin America. Three years ago, the Dominican people launched an armed uprising to overthrow the traitorous dictatorship of Balaguer. Although this uprising was brutally suppressed by U.S. imperialism, the revolutionary people of the Dominican Republic have never stopped fighting. They have gradually come to realize from the lessons of their temporary setbacks that to achieve victory in the Dominican Revolution, they must take the path of armed seizure of power, persist in long-term struggle, establish bases in the countryside, and surround the cities with the countryside, ultimately seizing the cities. Some revolutionaries have already gone to the countryside to organize and mobilize the masses.

In some cities under the strict control of the pro-American dictatorship in the Dominican Republic, mass struggles against the U.S. and the dictatorship have recently erupted. In March, students in the capital, Santo Domingo, defied the reactionary government's ban and took to the streets to hold demonstrations against the U.S. and the Balaguer dictatorship. Recently, to control the upcoming municipal elections in Santo Domingo, the reactionary government in the Dominican Republic has sent out large numbers of military police to occupy schools and intensify the persecution of patriotic and progressive forces. The patriots of Santo Domingo are resisting.

	Opposing U.S. Cultural Invasion

The young students of Brazil, who have been brutally persecuted by the pro-American reactionary government, have continuously launched struggles against U.S. cultural invasion and infiltration in Brazil. As early as last April and October, Brazilian youth students had launched large-scale struggles multiple times to oppose the agreement signed by the Brazilian dictatorship with the U.S. Agency for International Development, which is aimed at manipulating Brazil's educational affairs under the guise of cultural "aid."

Since March of this year, the flames of opposition to U.S. cultural invasion have risen again in Brazil. In early April, tens of thousands of young students in Rio de Janeiro, the capital of Goiás State, Goiânia, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul State, Porto Alegre, the capital of Northeast Brazil, Recife, and more than a dozen other cities held massive anti-U.S. and anti-dictatorship demonstrations. They protested against the barefaced cultural infiltration of the U.S. in Brazil and the bloody suppression by the reactionary government. On March 29, more than ten thousand students in Rio de Janeiro chanted slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism!" and "Down with the dictatorship!" and held a large-scale demonstration in the city center, strongly protesting the savage murder of a patriotic young student by U.S. imperialism and the dictatorship. Currently, the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle of Brazilian students is deepening.

	Launching a Strike Wave to Oppose U.S. Plunder

U.S. imperialism's intensified political control and economic plunder of Latin America have met with resolute opposition from the broad masses of the Latin American people.

In Chile, U.S. monopolies have rapidly increased their investments in mining, smelting, agriculture, livestock, and other industries since 1964, with a total investment of more than ten billion dollars, controlling the economic lifeline of Chile. The large-scale and sustained strike struggles launched by Chilean workers in March this year reflected the strong discontent and resistance of the broad laboring masses of Chile against U.S. imperialism.

Currently, more than ninety-five thousand workers in more than ten major industries, including copper mines and electricity, in Chile have launched a strike wave, opposing the plundering policies of the U.S. Many teachers, students, and patriotic intellectuals have also adopted various forms of struggle, such as strikes and boycotts, to support the just struggle of the striking workers.

	Opposing Dictatorship, Hunger, and Exploitation

The anti-U.S. struggles of the peoples of Uruguay, Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela have recently seen new developments. In Uruguay, tens of thousands of workers in the capital, Montevideo, held a demonstration march in the city on May 1, surging towards the U.S. embassy in the city, chanting slogans such as "Down with the Americans!" and bravely fighting with the police who came to suppress them.

On the same day, more than ten thousand workers in La Paz, the capital of Bolivia, also held a demonstration march against U.S. imperialism and the dictatorship. In Ecuador, workers have recently launched anti-U.S. struggles in some major cities. At the same time, more than two thousand peasants in Quito, the capital of Los Ríos Province, held a meeting to condemn U.S. imperialism as the culprit behind the poverty and hunger of the people in Ecuador. Workers in Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina, Santa Fe Province, Tucumán Province, and other cities have recently held demonstration marches, opposing the ruthless plunder and exploitation of U.S. imperialism in Argentina.

    在毛主席支持多米尼加人民反对美国武装侵略声明鼓舞下
    拉美人民反对美帝及其走狗的斗争不断发展
    新华社十一日讯　拉丁美洲人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争正在不断发展。最近，多米尼加、巴西、智利和其他一些拉丁美洲国家的人民，展开了不同形式、不同规模的群众性斗争。
      走武装夺取政权的道路
    世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席在一九六五年五月十二日发表的支持多米尼加人民反对美国武装侵略的声明，给了多米尼加人民和整个拉丁美洲人民的革命斗争以巨大的支持和鼓舞。在三年前，多米尼加人民发动了推翻卡夫拉尔卖国独裁政权的武装起义。虽然这次起义遭到了美帝国主义的血腥镇压，但是，多米尼加革命人民一直没有停止战斗。他们从遭受暂时挫折的教训中，逐步认识到：要取得多米尼加革命的胜利，必须走武装夺取政权的道路，坚持长期斗争，在农村建立根据地，以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市。一些革命者已经奔赴农村，开展组织和发动群众的工作。
    在多米尼加亲美独裁政权严密控制的一些城市里，最近连续爆发了反美反独裁的群众斗争。三月间，首都圣多明各的学生不顾反动当局的禁令，毅然走上街头，举行反美反巴拉格尔独裁政权的示威游行。最近，为了控制日益临近的圣多明各市政选举，多米尼加反动当局正在派出大批军警占领学校，加紧迫害爱国进步力量。圣多明各的爱国者正在进行反抗。
      反对美帝文化侵略
    遭受亲美反动政权残酷迫害的巴西青年学生，不断展开反对美国对巴西文化侵略和渗透的斗争。早在去年四月和十月，巴西的青年学生就多次展开大规模斗争，反对巴西独裁当局同美国国际开发署签订的一项目的在于操纵巴西教育事业的所谓文化“援助”协定。
    今年三月以来，反对美国文化侵略的烈火再次在巴西燃起。四月初，里约热内卢市、戈亚斯州首府戈亚尼亚、南里约格朗德州首府阿雷格里港、巴西东北部伯南布哥州首府累西菲城以及其他地区十多个城市的数以万计的青年学生，举行声势浩大的反美反独裁的示威游行，抗议美国对巴西进行赤裸裸的文化渗透和反动当局的血腥镇压。三月二十九日，里约热内卢市一万多名学生高呼“打倒美帝！”“打倒独裁！”的口号，在市中心举行大规模示威游行，强烈抗议美帝国主义和独裁政权野蛮杀害一位爱国青年学生。目前，巴西学生的反美爱国正义斗争正在深入发展。
      掀起罢工浪潮反对美帝掠夺
    美帝国主义加紧对拉丁美洲的政治控制和经济掠夺，遭到了拉丁美洲广大人民的坚决反对。
    在智利，美国垄断集团一九六四年以来迅速增加了在矿业、冶炼、农牧和其他工业方面的投资，目前投资总额已达到十多亿美元，控制了智利的经济命脉。智利工人在今年三月发动的大规模的、持续的罢工斗争，反映了智利广大劳动人民对美帝国主义的强烈不满和反抗。
    目前，智利铜矿、电力等十多个主要行业的九万五千多名工人先后掀起了罢工浪潮，反对美国的掠夺政策。许多教师、学生和爱国知识分子也采取罢教、罢课等各种斗争方式，支持罢工工人的正义斗争。
      反独裁　反饥饿　反剥削
    乌拉圭、阿根廷、玻利维亚、厄瓜多尔和委内瑞拉人民的反美斗争，近来又有新的发展。乌拉圭首都蒙得维的亚成万名工人，五月一日在市区举行示威游行，游行队伍涌向这个城市的美国大使馆，高呼“打倒美国佬”的口号，并且同前来镇压的警察展开了英勇的搏斗。
    同一天，玻利维亚首都拉巴斯一万多名工人，也举行了反对美帝国主义和独裁政府的示威游行。在厄瓜多尔，工人们最近在一些主要城市展开了反美斗争。同时，洛斯里奥斯省克维多城的两千多名农民举行集会，谴责美帝国主义是在厄瓜多尔造成人民贫困、饥饿的罪魁祸首。阿根廷首都布宜诺斯艾利斯、圣菲省、图库曼省及其他城市的工人，最近纷纷举行示威游行，反对美帝国主义对阿根廷进行穷凶极恶的掠夺和剥削。（附图片）
