The Brezhnev-Kosygin traitor clique has usurped the party and state power in the Soviet Union and is comprehensively restoring capitalism in all sectors of the national economy. The broad masses of workers in the Soviet Union have been deprived of all rights to be masters of their own fate and are being ruthlessly oppressed and enslaved. Arbitrary dismissal of workers has become an important means for the Soviet bourgeois privileged class to intensify political persecution and economic exploitation of the working class, and more and more people are being thrown into the ranks of the unemployed.

The existence of a vast army of the unemployed is a phenomenon inherent in capitalist society. After the October Socialist Revolution, the working class and other laboring people of the Soviet Union, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, established the dictatorship of the proletariat and implemented a socialist planned economy, gradually solving the serious unemployment problem left over from the tsarist period. However, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique has completely betrayed the cause of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Under the guise of the "party of the whole people" and the "state of the whole people," they have turned the dictatorship of the proletariat, established by the Soviet people with their blood and lives, into a bourgeois dictatorship that oppresses and enslaves the laboring people. The phenomenon of mass unemployment is once again threatening the broad masses of workers and other laborers in the Soviet Union.

Increasing Unemployment Among Workers

According to various sources, at present, in various parts of the Soviet Union, many laboring people are in the miserable plight of unemployment. The Kirov Oblast in the Russian Federation is a region with a population of only over three million, but in this oblast, there are approximately ninety thousand women with labor capacity who are unemployed. The American bourgeois mouthpiece, *U.S. News & World Report* magazine, recently quoted Soviet economist Sonin as saying that in the Soviet Union, except for a few departments, "an increasingly high tide of unemployment is rising in all aspects of the economy." According to reports, at present, out of the more than one hundred and ten million labor force in the Soviet Union, "approximately twelve percent are currently unemployed."

The great Lenin said: "If the production and distribution of products are not subject to comprehensive state statistics and supervision, then the power of the laborers, the freedom of the laborers, cannot be maintained, and the restoration of the capitalist system of oppression is inevitable." After the Soviet revisionist leadership clique usurped the party and state power in the Soviet Union, they implemented the capitalist principle of profit and free competition, destroyed the socialist planned economy and the socialist principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work," and dismantled socialist ownership, gradually turning this ownership into the ownership of the bourgeois privileged class. Thus, within the "state-owned" enterprises in the Soviet Union, the relationship between a small clique of privileged individuals and the workers has become the relationship between the employer and the employed. This small clique of privileged individuals, relying on their position of controlling and commanding the means of production and the various privileges granted to them by the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, can arbitrarily dismiss workers. After the Soviet revisionists began to implement the so-called "new economic system" with the capitalist principle of profit as its core, this situation has become even more serious.

Dismissing Workers, Exploiting Profits

Even from the scant materials revealed in Soviet revisionist publications, it is quite clear that the phenomenon of arbitrarily dismissing workers in various "state-owned" enterprises in the Soviet Union has reached an extremely shocking level. For example, a road machinery station with a total of one hundred and ninety workers had seventy-nine of them dismissed in one year.

After implementing the "new system," the leaders of five automobile companies in Moscow and Leningrad, in order to make huge profits, dismissed two hundred and thirty-nine workers in just five months. The manager of the 15th Automobile Repair Plant in Moscow, in his eagerness to make more profits, almost immediately dismissed about ten percent of the workers, causing a large number of workers to become unemployed.

Manufacturing Pretexts, Persecuting Workers

In today's Soviet Union, the bourgeois privileged class, represented by the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, uses dismissal as a means to intensify economic exploitation of workers, carry out political persecution, and maintain the reactionary rule of revisionism. The "enterprise regulations" issued by the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique to implement the "new system" further strengthened the power of enterprise leaders to dismiss workers. Members of the bourgeois privileged class openly declare that they "can do whatever they want." In a timber processing enterprise in Beslan, "anything can be used" by the enterprise leaders "as a reason to punish (workers)." They often threaten workers with the words of a capitalist: "If you don't want to, you can find another job!" Worker Kazov was dismissed without reason just because he criticized him. Engineer Kirev of the Korosten Railway Division in the Shostka Oblast of the Ukrainian Republic exposed the crime of stealing sleepers by some leaders of the division at a meeting, as a result, the exposed individuals were protected, while he was dismissed, the "charge" being that he "defamed the leaders," "did not let people work in peace," and so on.

The lives of large numbers of unemployed workers are extremely difficult. An unemployed female spinner, in order to live, wandered for two months looking for work. In the end, she was rejected everywhere and was forced to commit suicide.

Creating Pretexts, Deductions from Wages

The Soviet revisionist privileged class creates a vast army of the unemployed as an industrial reserve army, further intensifying the exploitation of employed workers. Many factory leaders, in order to pursue high profits, after dismissing a large number of workers, ordered the workers in the factory to "voluntarily" take on the work of two to three people. Some enterprise leaders create pretexts and arbitrarily deduct workers' wages. In a coal mine in the Rostov Oblast, workers should receive thirteen rubles a day for their labor, but the leaders of the mine only gave them three rubles, the rest were all exploited away.

The founder of the Soviet state, Lenin, pointed out on the second anniversary of the October Revolution: "The Soviet power will not allow the kulaks, the rich, the owners, the speculators, those who want to get rich without labor, those who want to exploit the poverty and hunger of the people to make a fortune, to act at will." "The Soviet power protects the laborers and opposes the speculators, the owners, the capitalists, and the landlords." Unfortunately, the power of the Soviet working class, especially the power to manage the state and enterprises, has now been usurped by the Soviet revisionist clique. Losing power means losing everything. The Soviet working class and other laboring people have once again fallen into the abyss of suffering. After seizing power, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique implements the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, ruthlessly oppressing and exploiting the laboring people. Today, the Soviet revisionist traitors shamelessly boast about the "right to work and rest" of Soviet people, that "Soviet people do not worry about unemployment, tyranny, and poverty," etc. This is simply the greatest mockery of the Soviet laboring people!

The Soviet People Oppose the Soviet Revisionist Clique

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches that the various reactionaries' "various persecutions of the revolutionary people, in the final analysis, can only promote the broader and more intense revolution of the people." No matter how hard the Soviet revisionist clique tries to peddle their fake communism, the broad masses of workers in the Soviet Union are increasingly seeing through the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique. The increasingly awakened Soviet people are continuously strengthening their struggle against the Soviet revisionist reactionary rule. A worker from Kiev pointed out that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique is "restoring capitalism," "Brezhnev and Kosygin are scoundrels, the Soviet people all oppose them." It can be said for certain that in the face of the Soviet working class with a glorious revolutionary tradition, all those who betray the October Revolution and oppress and exploit the Soviet people will absolutely not escape the punishment they deserve.

　　残酷剥削和奴役工人阶级　对广大人民实行资产阶级专政
　　苏修叛徒集团是一伙新的吸血鬼
    据新华社讯　本社记者报道：勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团篡夺苏联的党政大权，在国民经济各部门全面复辟资本主义，苏联广大职工被剥夺了当家作主的一切权利，受着残酷的压迫和奴役。任意解雇职工，已经成为苏联资产阶级特权阶层手中加紧对工人阶级进行政治迫害和经济剥削的重要手段，越来越多的人被投入失业者的行列。
    庞大的失业大军的存在，是资本主义社会固有的现象。十月社会主义革命以后，苏联工人阶级和其他劳动人民在布尔什维克党领导下，建立了无产阶级专政，实行社会主义的计划经济，逐步解决了沙皇时期遗留下来的严重失业问题。然而，苏修领导集团彻底背叛了无产阶级专政的事业，在“全民党”和“全民国家”的幌子下，把苏联人民用鲜血和生命所建立的无产阶级专政变成镇压和奴役劳动人民的资产阶级专政，大量失业的现象，重新威胁着苏联广大工人和其他劳动者。
    工人失业，大量增加
    据各方面消息透露，目前，在苏联全国各地都有许多劳动人民处于失业的悲惨境地中。俄罗斯联邦的基米罗伏州是一个仅有三百多万人口的州，但是在这个州，光是有劳动力的妇女就大约有九万人失业。美国资产阶级喉舌《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志不久前援引苏联经济学教授索宁的话报道说，现在在苏联，除了极少的几个部门外，经济的各个方面“正在出现日益高涨的失业浪潮”。据报道，目前在苏联一亿一千多万劳动力中，“大约有百分之十二的人现在是失业的”。
    伟大的列宁说过：“如果对于产品的生产和分配不实行全面的国家统计和监督，那么劳动者的政权、劳动者的自由，就不能维持下去，资本主义压迫制度的复辟，就不可避免。”苏修领导集团篡夺苏联党和国家的大权以后，推行资本主义的利润原则和自由竞争，破坏社会主义计划经济和“各尽所能，按劳分配”的社会主义法则，瓦解社会主义所有制，逐步把这种所有制变为资产阶级特权阶层的所有制。这样，在苏联“国营”企业内部，一小撮特权阶层同工人的关系，就成了雇佣同被雇佣的关系。这一小撮特权阶层凭借着他们掌握和支配生产资料的地位和苏修领导集团给予的种种特权，就可以随意解雇工人。在苏修开始推行以资本主义利润原则为核心的所谓“新经济体制”以后，这种情况就更加严重了。
    解雇职工，榨取利润
    即使根据苏修报刊透露的点滴材料也可以十分清楚地看出，苏联各“国营”企业中蛮横解雇职工的现象已经达到了非常惊人的程度。例如，有一个修路机械站总共有一百九十个职工，而这个站的领导人在一年当中就开除了七十九人。
    在实行“新体制”以后，莫斯科和列宁格勒五家汽车公司的领导人为了牟取暴利，在五个月中就裁减了二百三十九人。莫斯科第十五卡车维修厂的经理，由于急于想赚更多的利润，几乎一下子就解雇了约百分之十的工人，使大量工人失业。
    制造借口，迫害工人
    在今天的苏联，以苏修领导集团为代表的资产阶级特权阶层，把解雇作为对工人加重经济剥削，进行政治迫害和维护修正主义反动统治的一种手段。勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团为推行“新体制”而颁布的所谓“国营企业条例”更进一步加强了企业领导人解雇工人的权力。资产阶级特权阶层分子公然叫嚷，他们“想怎样干，就怎样干”。在贝斯兰市一个锯木制材企业，“什么东西都可以成为”企业领导人“拿来惩罚（工人）的理由”。他动不动用资本家的口吻威胁工人：“谁不愿意，可以另找工作！”工人卡佐夫只是由于对他提了意见，就被无理解雇了。乌克兰共和国什托密尔州科罗斯坚铁路分局的工程师基列夫在一次会议上揭发了分局某些领导人盗窃枕木的罪行，结果，被揭发者受到庇护，而他却被解雇，“罪名”是他“诽谤领导人”、“不让人安宁地工作”等等。
    大批大批失业工人的生活十分困难。一个失业的女细纱工为了生活，到处奔波了两个月寻找工作。结果，到处碰壁，最后被迫自杀了。
    巧立名目，克扣工资
    苏修特权阶层造成一个庞大的失业队伍作为产业后备军，就进一步加重对在业工人的剥削。许多工厂的领导人为了追求高额利润，在解雇了大批工人之后，勒令在厂工人“自愿”一个人担负两个到三个人的工作。有些企业负责人巧立名目，任意克扣工人的工资。在罗斯托夫州一个煤矿中，工人每天劳动应得工资十三个卢布，但这个煤矿的领导人只发给他们三个卢布，其余的都被剥削去了。
    苏维埃国家的缔造者列宁在十月革命两周年时曾经指出：“苏维埃政权决不允许富农、有钱人、有产者、投机者、想不劳而获的人、想利用人民的穷困和饥饿来发财的人任意妄为。”“苏维埃政权保护劳动者，反对投机分子、有产者、资本家和地主。”但是，不幸的是，苏联工人阶级手中的大权，首先是管理国家、管理企业的大权，如今已被苏修集团所篡夺。失去了政权就失去了一切，苏联工人阶级和其他劳动人民又重陷于苦难的深渊。苏修领导集团篡夺政权后实行资产阶级专政，对劳动人民残酷压迫和剥削。今天苏修叛徒们恬不知耻地吹嘘什么苏联人有“劳动权和休息权”、“苏联人民不担心失业、专横和贫困”等等，这简直是对苏联劳动人民最大的嘲弄！
    苏联人民反对苏修集团
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导说，各国反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”不管苏修集团如何拚命叫卖他们假共产主义的狗皮膏药，苏联广大工人群众越来越认清了苏修领导集团的叛徒面目。日益觉醒的苏联人民，正在不断加强反对苏修反动统治的斗争。一位基辅工人指出，苏修领导集团“复辟资本主义”，“勃列日涅夫和柯西金是坏蛋，苏联人民都反对他们。”可以肯定，在有着光荣革命传统的苏联工人阶级面前，一切背叛十月革命、压迫剥削苏联人民的家伙，都绝对逃脱不了应得的惩罚。
