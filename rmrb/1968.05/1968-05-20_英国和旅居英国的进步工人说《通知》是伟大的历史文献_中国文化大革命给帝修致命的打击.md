On the second anniversary of the issuance of the May 16 Circular by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966, progressive workers in Britain and those residing in Britain wrote to the New China News Agency's London branch to celebrate the great victories achieved by the Chinese Cultural Revolution over the past two years.

A group of young workers in London (including young workers residing in Britain) wrote: The issuance of this historic document, personally directed by Chairman Mao, marks the great victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat over the Khrushchevites in China, the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought over modern revisionists, and the great victory of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie.

The letter pointed out that the goal of the Khrushchevites in China was to restore capitalism. However, their evil plots have been smashed, and the dictatorship of the proletariat in China has been further consolidated.

The letter emphasized: "Chairman Mao pointed out: 'The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.' This profound analysis is of great significance not only to the Chinese people but also to the people of other countries."

When discussing the rapid progress China has made in the political, military, economic, and cultural fields over the past two years since the issuance of the Circular, the letter said, "These are all direct results of Chairman Mao's thoughts triumphing over counter-revolutionary modern revisionists."

The letter said: "The great teacher of the proletariat, Mao Zedong, is leading the Chinese people towards a brilliant future of communism; Chairman Mao is also leading the oppressed peoples of the world to break free from imperialism and capitalism and march towards liberation."

A group of British workers from the west of England wrote: "All revolutionary people are jubilant in celebrating the great victories and achievements of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in China, while imperialists and modern revisionists are disheartened."

These British workers wrote in their letter: "Chairman Mao Zedong, in his historical achievements and contributions, has brought Marxism-Leninism to a new stage, and the world has entered a new era, the era of Mao Zedong Thought. Undoubtedly, the Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is a document of the greatest historical significance." The letter said that all Marxist-Leninists and progressives must study this document to understand its importance. Because, "Today, if one does not deeply understand the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in China, one cannot claim to be a revolutionary, and in fact, will know nothing about the true nature of the world situation."

The letter pointed out that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat launched by the Chinese people has shattered the imperialists' delusional hopes of a capitalist restoration in China. The letter said that the increasing attacks by imperialist newspapers, radio stations, and television against the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in China most eloquently prove that the Cultural Revolution has dealt a fatal blow to imperialism and modern revisionism.

The letter emphasized: For revolutionaries, the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is a great source of inspiration. For all reactionaries, the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat means their doom is approaching.

A retired British railway worker wrote excitedly in his letter that on the second anniversary of the issuance of the Circular by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, "I express my deepest wish to unite with the Chinese people, and my deepest gratitude to the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao. Long live Chairman Mao!"

    英国和旅居英国的进步工人说《通知》是伟大的历史文献
    中国文化大革命给帝修致命的打击
    新华社伦敦十九日电　在中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》发表两周年的时候，英国和旅居英国的一些进步工人写信给新华社伦敦分社，欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命两年来取得的伟大胜利。
    伦敦的一批青年工人（包括旅英青年工人）来信说：毛主席亲自主持制定的这个历史文献的发表，标志着无产阶级文化大革命对中国的赫鲁晓夫之流取得的伟大胜利，标志着毛泽东思想对现代修正主义者取得的伟大胜利，也标志着无产阶级对资产阶级取得的伟大胜利。
    信件指出，中国赫鲁晓夫之流的目的，就是要在中国复辟资本主义。但是，他们的罪恶阴谋被粉碎了，中国的无产阶级专政更加巩固了。
    信件强调说：“毛主席指出：‘无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。’这一最深刻的分析，不仅对中国人民，而且对其他国家的人民，都具有重大的意义。”
    信件谈到《通知》发表两年来中国在政治、军事、经济和文化各个领域中的飞跃进展时说，这些“都是毛主席的思想战胜反革命现代修正主义者的直接结果”。
    信件说：“无产阶级的伟大导师毛泽东，正在领导中国人民走向共产主义的光辉灿烂的未来；毛主席也正在领导全世界被压迫人民摆脱帝国主义和资本主义而走向解放。”
    英格兰西部的一批英国工人来信说：“所有革命人民都欢欣鼓舞地欢呼（中国）无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利和成就，而帝国主义者和现代修正主义者则感到沮丧。”
    这些英国工人在信件中说：“毛泽东主席在他的历史功勋和贡献中，把马克思列宁主义发展到了一个崭新的阶段，全世界已经进入一个新时代，即毛泽东思想的时代。毫无疑问，中共中央的《通知》是具有最伟大的历史意义的文献。”信件说，所有马克思列宁主义者和进步人士都必须学习这个文件，以便认识它的重要意义。因为，“在今天，如果不深刻理解中国无产阶级文化革命，就不能自称为革命者，而且事实上将对世界形势的真正性质一无所知。”
    信件指出，中国人民在毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导下开展的无产阶级文化大革命，粉碎了帝国主义指望中国出现资本主义复辟的痴心妄想。信件说，帝国主义报刊、无线电台和电视台日益加强反对中国无产阶级文化大革命的谩骂，就最雄辩地证明了文化大革命给了帝国主义和现代修正主义致命的打击。
    信件强调指出：对革命者来说，无产阶级文化大革命是巨大鼓舞的泉源。对一切反动派来说，无产阶级文化大革命意味着他们的末日即将来临。
    一个退休的英国铁路职工在来信中激动地说，在中共中央《通知》发表两周年的时候，“我向中国人民表示我同他们团结一致的最深厚的愿望，向当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席表示我最深厚的感谢。祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
