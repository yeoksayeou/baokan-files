The Johnson administration of U.S. imperialism, in order to intensify the Vietnam War and make a desperate struggle, has recently been hurriedly recruiting cannon fodder.

The U.S. Department of Defense announced on April 22 that the U.S. government will conscript 45,900 people in May and 29,500 people in June, thus making the total number of conscripts for the first half of this year reach 221,700. This figure is more than 20,000 higher than the total number of conscripts for the whole of last year.

Before this, the Johnson administration, in April, successively convened its Vietnam War lackeys in New Zealand and Honolulu, Hawaii, to extort cannon fodder from them. At the same time, it decided to call up 24,500 reserve personnel within the country and continued to use the method of robbing Peter to pay Paul, transferring 34,000 troops from U.S. forces in Western Europe to be used in the Vietnam War.

These series of measures taken by Johnson to prepare cannon fodder for intensifying the Vietnam War not only once again exposed the desperate situation of U.S. imperialism's defeat in Vietnam and its shortage of troops, but also exposed the fraud of his so-called "peace talks," indicating that U.S. imperialism's aggressive ambitions will never change until its death.

　　美帝侵略野心至死不变加紧搜罗炮灰强化侵越战争
    新华社讯　美帝约翰逊政府为了强化侵越战争，进行垂死挣扎，最近又在加紧搜罗炮灰。
    美国国防部四月二十二日宣布，美国政府五月份将征兵四万五千九百人，六月份征兵两万九千五百人，这样就使今年上半年的征兵总人数达到二十二万一千七百人。这个数字比去年全年的征兵总数还多两万多。
    在这之前，约翰逊政府在四月间先后在新西兰和美国的檀香山召集其侵越仆从，向他们勒索炮灰。同时，它又决定在国内征召两万四千五百名预备役人员，并且继续采取拆西墙补东墙的办法，从驻西欧美军中抽调三万四千名供侵越战争使用。
    约翰逊这一系列为加剧侵越战争而准备炮灰的措施，不仅再一次暴露了美帝侵越惨败，兵力不足的狼狈相，而且戳穿了他加紧玩弄的“和谈”骗局，表明美帝的侵略野心是至死不会改变的。
