Under the radiant guidance of the May 7th Directive, the snow-capped mountains are adorned in green.

The Kaji La pass, at an altitude of 4,800 meters, has long been considered a "production no-go zone." The high mountains have been covered in ice and snow for years...

Our great leader Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive has given the soldiers and officers of the Kaji La station immense encouragement and strength. They are determined to follow Chairman Mao's directive to be both soldiers and farmers, to embody the spirit of Yu Gong moving mountains, to fight against nature, to fight against the earth, and to fight against the "selfish" thoughts in their minds. They strive to reclaim land from the dormant highlands and transform the ice-covered mountains into green fields.

A battle against nature began! The soldiers and officers of the station braved the harsh winds and heavy snow, shoveling away the snow and rocks, and bringing in soil from elsewhere to cover the ground. They finally cleared six or seven acres of wasteland and, for the first time in history, planted vegetable seeds on the highlands. The seedlings sprouted, but one challenge after another followed. Blizzards frequently struck, and field mice often caused damage. With boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao in their hearts, the soldiers and officers fought tenaciously against the harsh weather and pestilence. When the cold winds and frost arrived, they burned cow dung around the vegetable fields to keep them warm; when field mice caused damage, they devised every possible method to eradicate them. Through their struggle against nature, they overcame countless difficulties and discovered a set of rules for planting vegetables in high-altitude mountainous regions, including seeding, management, and preventing frost damage. For the first time, the "production no-go zone" sprouted vegetables and donned a green coat.

Songs echo through the mountains.

The soldiers of a certain unit's Sixth Company firmly implement the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant May 7th Directive, treating the 4,000-mile Qinghai-Tibet Highway as a vast battlefield for propagating Mao Zedong Thought. As the convoy sets out on patrol, they closely follow Chairman Mao's latest directives, composing and performing on the go; they spread Mao Zedong Thought wherever they go, whether by road or by air.

One day, the convoy arrived at Yan Shiping at the foot of the Tanggula Mountains. It was snowing heavily, and the temperature had dropped to minus thirty degrees Celsius. The propaganda team leader, Yin Da Hua, had been suffering from altitude sickness and had not eaten for two days, but thinking of the glorious task of propagating Mao Zedong Thought, he was full of energy. He encouraged his comrades, saying, "The more difficult the conditions, the more challenges we face, the more we must propagate Mao Zedong Thought." The propagandist Guan Fengxiang, to perform the skit "I Love Reading the 'Three Constantly Read Articles'" well, forgot the cold and took off his cotton jacket, performing with great passion, earning enthusiastic applause from the Tibetan spectators.

Once, while the convoy was stopped for repairs, three Tibetan herdsmen ran out of a tent by the roadside, looking at the portrait of Chairman Mao on top of the truck's cab, waving red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!" The deep class feelings of the Tibetan people for Chairman Mao deeply moved the propagandist Weng Jingguo. Although he was ill at the time, thinking of the opportunity to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the Tibetans, he and his comrades performed two excellent skits for the three Tibetans. The Tibetans were so delighted that they shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Awakening the Gobi Desert.

Producing in the Gobi Desert is no easy task. Dig two meters deep into the ground, and it's all big and small stones. To open an acre of land, you have to dig out more than six hundred cubic meters of stones. The climate of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is also unpredictable, with scorching heat in summer and biting cold in winter, often dropping to minus twenty degrees Celsius. Cultivating crops under such climatic conditions is indeed challenging.

All personnel of the Twenty-Second Hospital under the Kunlun Mountains, inspired by the brilliant May 7th Directive of the great leader Chairman Mao, are determined to fight against nature and the earth, to transform the Gobi Desert into fertile fields. From the director, political commissar, doctors, nurses to light patients, everyone actively participated in this battle to conquer nature. They shoveled out sand and stones two meters deep, sifted them with iron sieves, discarded the stones, and kept the fine sand, mixed it with fine soil brought from outside, then fertilized and watered, and washed away the salt and alkali time and time again.

The entire hospital persevered for more than half a year and finally opened up fertile fields in the Gobi Desert. Everyone who came here was deeply moved, saying, "It is Chairman Mao's brilliant May 7th Directive that has turned the Gobi Desert green and made people's thoughts red."

### 在“五·七”指示的光辉照耀下

　　在“五·七”指示的光辉照耀下
    雪山披绿装
    海拔四千八百米的卡集拉，历来被认为是“生产禁区”。高山长年在冰雪覆盖下沉睡着……
    我们的伟大导师毛主席的“五·七”指示给卡集拉兵站的指战员们以巨大的鼓舞和力量。他们决心遵照毛主席亦军亦农的指示，发扬愚公移山的精神，与天斗，与地斗，与自己头脑里的“私”字斗，向沉睡的高原要菜，让冰雪的高山换装。
    一场与大自然的战斗开始了！兵站指战员们冒着狂风大雪，刨雪开山，搬走了冰雪岩石，再从别处挖来泥土盖上，终于开出了六、七亩荒地，破天荒第一次在高原播下菜种。菜苗长出来了，但是一个又一个的困难跟着而来。暴风雪时时侵袭，地鼠也常常破坏。指战员们怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的红心，同恶劣的气候和兽害进行了顽强的搏斗。风雪霜冻来临，他们就在菜地周围用牛粪烧火保温；地鼠破坏，他们就千方百计地捕灭。在同大自然的斗争中，克服了无数困难，摸索出了下种、管理、防冻害等一套高原山区种植蔬菜的规律。“生产禁区”第一次长出了蔬菜，披上了绿装。
    歌声遍千山
    解放军某部六连的同志，坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示，把四千里青藏线当成宣传毛泽东思想的广阔阵地。车队出发执勤，紧密结合毛主席的最新指示，现编现演，走一路、红一线；住一站，红一片；轮飞万里，歌遍千山。
    一天，车队到了唐古拉山下的雁石坪，天正下着鹅毛大雪，气温低到零下三十度。宣传组长尹大华，因患高山反应症，已经两天没有吃饭了，但一想到宣传毛泽东思想是最光荣的战斗任务，便浑身是劲。他鼓励同志们说：“条件越艰苦，困难越多，我们越是要宣传毛泽东思想。”宣传员关风祥为了演好《俺最爱读“老三篇”》这个节目，忘了严寒，脱下棉衣，满怀激情地进行表演，博得了藏胞观众的热烈掌声。
    一次，车队途中停下来检修，公路旁边的帐篷里跑出来三个藏族牧民，望着汽车驾驶室顶上的毛主席画像，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”藏族人民热爱毛主席的深厚的阶级感情，深深地感动了宣传员翁经国同志。他当时虽然有病，但想到这是向藏胞宣传毛泽东思想的好机会，就和同志们一道，给这三个藏胞表演了两个精采节目。藏胞喜得连声高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    唤醒戈壁滩
    戈壁滩上搞生产，可不是容易的事。从地面往下挖两尺多深，全是大大小小的石头，开一亩地，就要挖出六百多立方的石头来。青藏高原气候又变化无常，热时太阳似火，冷时寒风刺骨，气温常常降到零下二十多度。在这样的气候条件下种庄稼，困难可真不少。
    昆仑山下的二十二医院全体人员，在伟大领袖毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示的鼓舞下，决心同天斗，同地斗，要把戈壁滩变成良田。从院长、政委、医生、护士到轻病员，都积极投入了这场征服大自然的战斗。他们一锹一锹地挖出两尺多深的砂石，用铁筛过筛，扔掉石头，留下细沙，用外面运来的细土掺合在一起，然后施肥，浇水，一次又一次地冲洗盐碱。
    全院人员坚持奋斗了多半年，终于在戈壁滩上开出了良田。大家把来自祖国四面八方的菜籽播种在地里，获得了第一次大丰收。到这里来的同志都深有感触地说：“是毛主席的光辉的‘五·七’指示，使戈壁滩变绿了，使人们的思想变红了。”　（解放军总后勤部供稿）
