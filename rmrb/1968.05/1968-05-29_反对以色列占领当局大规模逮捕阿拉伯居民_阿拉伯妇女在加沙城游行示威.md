Several hundred Arab women held a demonstration march in Gaza City, which is under Israeli occupation, on the 23rd to protest against the Israeli occupation authorities' mass arrests of Arab residents under the pretext of searching for guerrillas.

During the march, many young students from Gaza joined in. Many staff members of the Gaza Hospital also participated in the demonstration.

The Israeli aggressors, using the excuse that two Israeli settlers were killed by a landmine on the 21st, carried out a massive roundup in Gaza City and imposed a curfew.

Under strong protests from the local people, the Israeli occupation authorities were forced to release many of the detained residents, but twenty people are still being illegally detained.

According to reports, in another Israeli-occupied city, Hebron on the West Bank of the Jordan River, about a thousand Arab people recently held a protest rally to condemn the Israeli aggressors for moving a large number of Jews into Hebron.

The Israeli aggressors, in order to consolidate their unpopular rule in the occupied areas and legalize their occupation, have been carrying out large-scale immigration to the occupied areas for a long time and have been plundering Arab land on a large scale.

    The 135th Session of the Sino-American Ambassadorial Talks Postponed

    According to a report from New China News Agency on the 28th, due to the fact that our country's ambassador could not return to his post at the scheduled time, and because there is currently nothing to discuss, Chen Dong, Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Poland, was instructed on May 18 to send a letter to Ambassador Gronouski, the U.S. representative for the Sino-American Ambassadorial Talks, proposing that the 135th Sino-American talks, originally scheduled for May 29, 1968, be postponed to mid or late November. The specific date will be determined later.

    反对以色列占领当局大规模逮捕阿拉伯居民
    阿拉伯妇女在加沙城游行示威
    新华社讯　特拉维夫消息：几百名阿拉伯妇女二十三日在以色列侵占的加沙城举行游行示威，抗议以色列占领当局以搜查游击队为名，大规模逮捕阿拉伯居民的罪行。
    在游行途中，加沙的青年学生纷纷参加进游行行列。加沙医院的许多职工也参加了示威。
    以色列侵略者借口两名以色列移民二十一日被地雷炸死，在加沙城疯狂实行大搜捕，并施行了宵禁。
    在当地人民的强烈抗议下，以色列占领当局不得不释放了许多被“扣留询查”的居民，但有二十人仍被无理扣押。
    据报道，在位于约旦河西岸的另一以色列占领城市希布伦，约一千名阿拉伯人民最近举行抗议集会，谴责以色列侵略者向希布伦移进了大批犹太人。
    以色列侵略者为了巩固他们在以占区不得人心的统治并使占领合法化，长期以来一直向以占区进行大规模移民，并大肆掠夺阿拉伯人民的土地。中美大使级会谈第一百三十五次会议延期举行
