Look, the traitorous clique of Soviet revisionists plays a shameful role
Openly viciously attacks the just struggle of Paris students and teachers
Publicly cheers for the French ruling clique's suppression of students

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on May 14, a Moscow dispatch: The Soviet revisionist traitorous clique recently launched vicious slanders and attacks against the just struggle of French students and teachers, openly playing the shameful role of an accomplice to the French ruling clique.

Since this year, French students and teachers have been continuously fighting against the corrupt educational system in France and protesting the suppression of the student movement by the French authorities. On May 6, they held a massive demonstration of more than ten thousand people in Paris for this purpose. This struggle is completely just, and therefore has received widespread support both domestically and internationally. However, the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique is very dissatisfied with this. On May 8, they instructed their main propaganda tool, *Pravda*, to publish a Tass news agency report from May 7, which blatantly stood on the side of the French ruling clique, cursing the demonstration of French students and teachers on May 6 in Paris as "riots." Clearly, it was the French police who carried out the bloody suppression of this demonstration, but they insisted on exonerating the French authorities, claiming that the students and teachers who demonstrated "clashed with the police," and praised in an approving tone that "the ringleaders of the riots have been handed over to the court for trial, and six of them have been sentenced to two months in prison and fines," shamelessly cheering for the French ruling clique's suppression of the demonstrating students.

In order to sabotage the increasingly high tide of the French student movement, the Soviet revisionist traitorous clique also gnashed their teeth in the report, slandering the French students and teachers who actively participated in this struggle, accusing their just struggle against the corrupt French educational system and resisting the bloody suppression by the French authorities of being "rebellious actions." Not only that, but even the French authorities' cooperation in violent suppression and the use of propaganda machinery to viciously attack the French student movement also became an excuse for the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique to attack the French students and teachers who actively participated in the demonstration. They blatantly lied, saying that the reason the French bourgeois press and radio stations "launched fierce attacks" on the students was because "these elements incited the students to take action, thus causing it." The accomplices have reached such a level of shamelessness!

    看，苏修叛徒集团扮演的可耻角色
    公然恶毒攻击巴黎学生和教师的正义斗争
    公开为法国统治集团镇压学生的行径叫好
    据新华社十四日讯　莫斯科消息：苏修叛徒集团最近对法国学生和教师目前展开的正义斗争进行了恶毒的诬蔑和攻击，公开扮演了法国统治集团帮凶的可耻角色。
    今年以来，法国学生和教师不断进行斗争，反对法国现行的腐朽的教育制度，并抗议法国当局对学生运动的镇压。五月六日，他们为此在巴黎举行了一万多人的声势浩大的示威。这个斗争是完全正义的，因此在国内外得到了广泛的支持。可是，勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团对此却大为不满。五月八日，他们指使自己的主要宣传工具《真理报》刊登塔斯社七日的一条报道，公然站在法国统治集团的立场上，破口大骂法国学生和教师六日在巴黎的示威是什么“骚乱”。明明是法国警察对这次示威进行了血腥镇压，他们却偏偏要为法国当局开脱罪责，把这说成是示威的学生和教师“同警察冲突”，并用赞赏的口吻宣传说：“骚乱的祸首被提交法庭受审，其中的六个人被判处两个月的徒刑和罚款”，赤裸裸地为法国统治集团镇压示威学生的行为喝采叫好。
    为了破坏日益高涨的法国学生运动，苏修叛徒集团在报道中还咬牙切齿地诽谤积极参加这次斗争的法国学生和教师，诬蔑他们反对法国腐朽教育制度、反抗法国当局的血腥镇压的正义斗争是什么“叛乱行动”。不仅如此，甚至连法国当局配合暴力镇压，开动宣传机器恶毒攻击法国学生运动，也成了勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流攻击积极参加示威的法国学生和教师的借口。他们睁着眼瞎说什么法国资产阶级报刊和电台对学生之所以“发起猛烈的攻击”，是由于“这些分子挑动学生采取行动，从而引起”的。帮凶帮到这种程度，真是无耻透顶！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”苏修领导集团正是出于他们反动的阶级本性，一贯充当帝国主义的帮凶，为维护资本主义世界的统治“秩序”积极效劳。
