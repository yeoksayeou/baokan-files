Two years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao personally directed the formulation of the epoch-making document—the May 16th Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966—which sounded the battle cry for a full-scale attack on the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev.

Today, as we celebrate the decisive victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, recalling the two-year battle, I deeply feel that the revolutionary mass movement guided by Mao Zedong Thought possesses boundless power.

The handful of capitalist roaders within the Qinghai Provincial Committee and our Qinghai University were precisely the ones who were submerged in the unprecedentedly vast tide of the revolutionary mass movement. From the very beginning of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards of the Qinghai University Veterinary and Animal Husbandry College responded to the call of our great leader Chairman Mao and launched a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist roaders within our college. This handful of capitalist roaders were terrified of the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. They colluded with the handful of capitalist roaders within the Provincial Committee, using every possible means to sabotage and attempt to suppress the vigorous mass movement. At this moment, I repeatedly studied the May 16th Circular personally directed by our great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao clearly pointed out in the Circular: "Those in authority taking the capitalist road at the top level of the Party, and, in the Government, army, and various cultural circles, are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the conditions are ripe, they will seize political power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." The great teachings of Chairman Mao, and the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards armed with Mao Zedong Thought, helped me further understand the great significance of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

I am a descendant of a poor herder. It was Chairman Mao and the Communist Party that liberated me from the sea of suffering and nurtured me from an ordinary herder into an honorable Communist Party member. Could I allow the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party to restore capitalism? No! I resolved to closely follow our great leader Chairman Mao, firmly unite with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and charge against the enemies of the proletariat.

After I publicly expressed my support for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, the handful of capitalist roaders within the Provincial Committee, using the power they temporarily usurped, labeled me as a "counter-revolutionary" and carried out ruthless struggles against me and other revolutionary comrades. At the same time, they intensified their suppression of the revolutionary masses. However, the broad revolutionary warriors of the proletariat who are absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "resolving to overcome all difficulties, not fearing any sacrifice, and striving for victory," launched an even fiercer attack on the handful of class enemies. Their fearless revolutionary spirit further inspired me. I firmly believe that no matter how rampant the handful of class enemies are, victory will surely belong to the revolutionary masses who have grasped Mao Zedong Thought.

Last March, a thunderous spring storm, the Central Committee's decision on the Qinghai issue, was issued. This decision crushed the desperate struggles of the handful of class enemies and shattered the bourgeois reactionary line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev. The Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Qinghai Province and Qinghai University achieved decisive victories.

The two-year Cultural Revolution of the proletariat made me deeply feel the greatness of Chairman Mao and the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought. With the great Mao Zedong Thought, we can be invincible and victorious wherever we go; without Mao Zedong Thought, we cannot survive even for a moment. The living class struggle facts of the past two years also made me see the great historical merits of the mass movement and further deeply understand: "The masses are the real heroes."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In a certain sense, the most intelligent and most capable are the most experienced fighters." I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, forever fight alongside the revolutionary masses, humbly learn from the revolutionary masses, be a student of the masses, never leave the masses, and forever be a faithful servant of the people.

    向群众学习，一刻也不脱离群众
    青海大学革命委员会主任　达洛
    两年前，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的划时代的文献——中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，吹响了向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部全面进攻的战斗号角。
    今天，喜庆无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性的胜利，回想起两年来的战斗历程，我深深体会到，毛泽东思想指引下的革命群众运动具有无穷的威力。
    青海省委内和我们青海大学党内一小撮走资派，就是在规模空前巨大的革命群众运动洪流中覆灭的。无产阶级文化大革命一开始，我们青海大学畜牧兽医学院的广大革命师生和红卫兵小将就响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，向我院党内一小撮走资派发起猛烈进攻。这一小撮走资派对毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，怕得要死。他们和省委内一小撮走资派勾结在一起，千方百计地进行破坏，妄图将轰轰烈烈的群众运动压下去。就在这个时候，我反复学习了伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的《通知》。毛主席在《通知》中明确指出：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”毛主席的伟大教导，用毛泽东思想武装起来的红卫兵小将的革命行动，使我进一步理解了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义。
    我是一个贫苦牧民的后代，是毛主席和共产党把我从苦海里解放出来，把我从一个普通的牧民培养成一个光荣的共产党员。我能让中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派复辟资本主义吗？不能！我下决心要紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，坚决和无产阶级革命派团结在一起，向无产阶级的敌人冲锋。
    当我公开表示支持无产阶级革命派以后，省委内一小撮走资派就利用他们暂时窃据的权力，把我打成“反革命”，对我和其他革命同志进行残酷的斗争。同时，变本加厉地镇压革命群众。但是无限忠于毛主席的广大的无产阶级革命派战士，遵照毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，向一小撮阶级敌人展开了更猛烈的进攻。他们那种不怕任何困难的大无畏的革命精神，进一步鼓舞了我。我坚信，不管一小撮阶级敌人多么猖狂，胜利一定属于掌握了毛泽东思想的革命群众。
    去年三月，平地一声春雷，中央关于青海问题的决定下达了。这个决定打垮了一小撮阶级敌人的垂死挣扎，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的资产阶级反动路线，青海省和青海大学的无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性的胜利。
    两年来的无产阶级文化大革命，使我深深地体会到毛主席的英明伟大，毛泽东思想的威力无穷。有了伟大的毛泽东思想，我们就能所向披靡，无往而不胜；离开毛泽东思想，就一刻也不能生存。两年来活生生的阶级斗争事实，也使我看到了群众运动的伟大历史功勋，更加深刻地理解到：“群众是真正的英雄”。
    毛主席教导我们说：“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”我一定要遵循毛主席的教导，永远和革命群众战斗在一起，虚心向革命群众学习，当群众的小学生，一刻也不脱离群众，永远做人民的忠实勤务员。
