The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people of Shenyang City, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, with the strong support of the Shenyang garrison, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, and continuously launch fierce attacks on the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Northeast and Liaoning-Shenyang regions, smashing their evil plots to restore capitalism, and achieving one great victory after another. The revolutionary and production situation in the whole city is excellent and getting better and better.

Now, in this famous industrial city, revolutionary criticism battlefields are set up everywhere. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, resolutely oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, and strike back at the right reversal wind, determined to criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and their agents in Northeast and Liaoning-Shengyang regions, and to expose all hidden traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries, to achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

"Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people in Shenyang City always put learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work in the struggle. They insist on learning and applying it in the struggle, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely criticize all the revisionist fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, making the revolutionary criticism more profound and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line more deeply rooted in people's hearts. Through persistent and profound revolutionary criticism, Chairman Mao's latest instructions are further implemented, effectively promoting the revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought. By April 30, over 2,890 units in the city have achieved revolutionary great unity. More than 90% of the factories and enterprises have achieved revolutionary great unity.

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people in Shenyang City, on the one hand, take actual actions to grasp the revolution and actively attack the class enemies; on the other hand, take actual actions to promote production and effectively counter the sabotage of the class enemies. The production value of municipal industrial enterprises is rising month by month. The production value in March this year increased significantly compared to January and February, with eight major industrial products exceeding the production volume of the same period last year. The production in April also increased compared to March.

Currently, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people in Shenyang City are taking even higher combat postures to achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and welcome the birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Liaoning Province and Shenyang City.

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people in Bengbu City, Anhui Province, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, vigorously promote Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, effectively promoting revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination. Currently, more than 98% of the grassroots units in Bengbu City have achieved revolutionary great unity, and more and more grassroots units are achieving revolutionary three-in-one combination. The industrial production in the whole city has also rapidly increased, with the total industrial output value in March increasing by 44% compared to February, and April increasing by 10% compared to March. In terms of railway transportation, the volume of goods sent in April increased by 23% compared to March.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." The broad revolutionary masses in Bengbu City, following Chairman Mao's teaching, quickly launched a wave of vigorously promoting and improving Mao Zedong Thought study classes. By the end of April, the city had held over 4,000 study classes of various types, with over 200,000 people participating in the study. The broad revolutionary masses in the study classes criticized and repudiated themselves, strengthened their proletarian party spirit, overcame bourgeois factionalism, and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The People's Liberation Army's support-leftist troops stationed in Bengbu City have made contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Bengbu City in the "three supports and two militaries" work.

Under the excellent situation, the Revolutionary Committee of Bengbu City was born with honor on May 1.
