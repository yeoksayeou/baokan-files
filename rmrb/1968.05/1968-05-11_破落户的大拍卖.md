According to reports from Western newspapers, the British government recently sold the London Bridge, which spans the Thames River, to an American oil company for $2.46 million. The American monopolist capitalists will dismantle the bridge and transport it back to the United States, where it will be rebuilt in a new amusement park in the Arizona desert to attract tourists and serve as a money-making venture. This incident vividly reflects the impending doom of the increasingly declining British imperialism.

The London Bridge is the first bridge over the Thames River, initially built in the 10th century. After several renovations, it was completed in its current form, a five-arched stone bridge, in 1831. It has witnessed the rise and fall of the British Empire from the mid-19th century during the reign of Queen Victoria, when British colonialism dominated the world, to the present day, when the Wilson government was forced to announce the withdrawal of troops from east of the Suez. It is no wonder that people regard it, along with the ancient Westminster Parliament building, as a symbol of London and Britain. However, just as the offspring of a declining household sells off ancestral antiques to nouveau riche, the British government, burdened with debt, sold this ancient London Bridge for a few million dollars in foreign exchange. This shows to what extent British imperialism has reached its end!

Since the war, British imperialism, in order to maintain its so-called "great power" status, has eagerly followed the aggressive and war policies of American imperialism. However, as Lenin pointed out, "The alliance of capitalist powers is a futile fraud, actually a gang of robbers who steal from each other." The result of the so-called "special relationship" between the U.S. and Britain is that British imperialism has become increasingly a vassal of American imperialism. Britain has become a military base for the United States and an investment site for American monopolies. American capital controls half of Britain's modern industry, and one out of every seventeen British workers is employed by American capital. Britain's plan to manufacture its own nuclear missiles was also vetoed by the United States. The pound has become a sacrificial lamb to shield the dollar from crisis. The so-called "dominions" and colonies of British imperialism have one by one fallen into the sphere of influence of American imperialism. In fact, to obtain dollars to prolong its existence, British imperialism has long been selling itself piece by piece to American imperialism. The sale of the London Bridge is but a small transaction in this great auction.

American monopolies are now taking advantage of the decline of British imperialism to buy up Britain's "antiques." Recently, in addition to purchasing the London Bridge, they have also bought two famous old British passenger ships, the "Queen Mary" and the "Queen Elizabeth," and turned them into river hotels in the United States. However, this is merely the dying gasp of the imperialist system. Do you not see that American imperialism is following in the footsteps of British imperialism, rapidly heading towards collapse? In the near future, these American nouveau riche will themselves become "antiques" of the imperialist era. The difference is that by then, there will be no one willing to pay a high price to buy these "antiques."

    破落户的大拍卖
    晓文
    据西方报纸报道，英国政府最近把横跨泰晤士河的伦敦桥，以二百四十六万美元的代价，卖给了美国的一家石油公司。美国垄断资本家将把这座桥拆掉运回美国，在亚利桑那州沙漠上一个新兴的游乐场所重建起来，作为吸引游客的一棵摇钱树。这件事情生动地反映了日益没落的英帝国主义的日暮途穷。
    伦敦桥是泰晤士河上的第一座桥，初建于第十世纪，经过几次改建，到一八三一年建成现在这样一座五拱的大石桥。它从十九世纪中叶英国殖民主义称霸世界的维多利亚女王时代，一直到今天被迫宣布从苏伊士以东撤军的威尔逊政府，可算是阅尽了英帝国的一部盛衰沧桑史。无怪乎人们把它同威斯敏斯特古老的国会大厦一起，当作伦敦和英国的象征。但是，正象破落户的子弟把家里祖传的古董拍卖给暴发户一样，欠了一屁股债的英国政府，为了换得几百万美元的外汇，竟把这座古老的伦敦桥拍卖给了美国的阔佬。可见英帝国主义的穷途末路，已经到了何等地步！
    战后以来，英帝国主义为了保持它的所谓“大国”地位，竭力追随美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。但是，正如列宁所指出的，“资本主义列强的联盟是一种无聊的骗局，实际上是一群你抢我夺的强盗的联盟”。所谓美英“特殊关系”的结果，是英帝国主义越来越成为美帝国主义的附庸。英国成了美国的军事基地和美国垄断资本的投资场所。美国资本控制了英国现代化工业的一半，每十七个英国工人中就有一个人为美国资本所雇用。英国自己制造核导弹的计划，也被美国所否定。英镑成了给美元危机挡头阵的替死鬼。英帝国主义的所谓“自治领”和殖民地，一个个落入了美帝国主义的势力范围。事实上，为了得到美元来苟延残喘，英帝国主义早就在把自己一点一点地拍卖给美帝国主义。伦敦桥的出卖，不过是这个大拍卖中的一桩小交易罢了。
    美国垄断资本现在乘英帝国主义没落的机会，争相购买英国的“古董”。它们最近除了买走了伦敦桥以外，还买走了英国的两艘著名的旧客船“玛丽女王号”和
  “伊丽莎白女王号”，把它们弄到美国去作为河上旅馆。但是，这也不过是帝国主义制度在死亡前的回光返照。君不见美帝国主义正在步英帝国主义后尘，迅速走向崩溃。不久的将来，美国的这些暴发户们自己也将成为帝国主义时代的“古董”。所不同的是，到那时候，愿意出高价来收买这些“古董”的人，是再也不会有了。
