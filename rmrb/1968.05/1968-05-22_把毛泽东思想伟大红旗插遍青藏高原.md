The important article "A Milestone Document" published in the editorial departments of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily states: "Over the past two years, the great victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country are the great achievements of the revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought against the bourgeoisie and all the old ideas of the exploiting classes." In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers have raised the revolutionary criticism banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launching a revolutionary criticism against the enemies of the proletariat. In just two years, the flames of revolutionary criticism have spread across the land, burning more and more fiercely!

Revolutionary criticism has exposed the counter-revolutionary revisionist faces of the handful of top capitalist roaders within the Party, such as China's Khrushchev, under the bright sunlight. The revolutionary people have seen more clearly that they are the most dangerous enemies of the proletariat under socialist conditions. Only by thoroughly smashing their counter-revolutionary revisionist line and eliminating its poison, by firmly establishing Mao Zedong Thought, and by planting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought across all fronts, can we ensure that the proletariat's iron-clad state remains unshakable for generations to come.

We are soldiers who have been driving on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau for years. Over the past two years, under the guidance of the "Notice," we have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, turning the vast plateau into a battlefield, and taking up our pens to sweep away the black gangs. On the 4,000-mile Qinghai-Tibet Highway, we have launched a vigorous revolutionary criticism. When the convoy sets out on duty, we paste revolutionary criticism cartoons and articles on the car covers, turning them into mobile columns. Wherever we go, we bring revolutionary criticism with us. We set up battlefields at the sources of rivers and carry out criticism in the foothills of the Kunlun Mountains. From officers to soldiers, everyone takes up the pen and joins the fight. Comrades say, we must turn every word and every article of revolutionary criticism into a cannonball aimed at the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, such as China's Khrushchev. We will not stop until we have thoroughly criticized and exposed them.

We must hold our guns and take up our pens, carrying out a sustained and thorough revolutionary criticism, launching an unrelenting attack on the enemy, and planting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

    把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍青藏高原
    人民解放军总后勤部学习毛主席著作标兵、汽车某团六连
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》编辑部重要文章《划时代的文献》指出：“两年来，我国无产阶级文化大革命运动所取得的伟大胜利，就是毛泽东思想对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级旧思想进行革命大批判的伟大成果。”在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，亿万工农兵群众，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，对无产阶级的敌人展开了革命的大批判。两年之间，革命大批判的烈火燃遍了万水千山，愈燃愈烈！
    革命的大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大走资派的反革命修正主义面目暴露在光天化日之下，革命人民更加认清了他们是社会主义条件下无产阶级的最危险的敌人，只有彻底粉碎他们的反革命修正主义路线，并肃清其流毒，大立毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍一切阵地，才能使无产阶级的铁打江山千秋万代永不变色。
    我们是长年奔驰在青藏高原上的汽车兵。两年来，在《通知》的光辉照耀下，我们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，千里高原摆战场，挥笔上阵扫黑帮，在四千里青藏公路上轰轰烈烈地开展了革命的大批判。车队出发执勤，我们就把革命大批判的漫画、文章贴在汽车篷布上，办成活动专栏，走到那里，就把革命大批判带到那里。江河源头摆战场，昆仑山麓搞批判。从干部到战士，人人口诛笔伐，个个奋勇上阵。同志们说，我们要把革命大批判的每句话，每篇文章，都当作射向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的炮弹，不把他们批倒批臭，决不收兵。
    我们要紧握枪杆拿起笔，深入持久地开展革命大批判，向敌人发起不停顿的进攻，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍青藏高原。
