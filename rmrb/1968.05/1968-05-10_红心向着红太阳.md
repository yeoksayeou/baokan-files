On the 8th, our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin warmly received us. This is the greatest happiness and the greatest honor of our lives. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! In this most unforgettable and exciting moment, let us sincerely wish you, dear Chairman, a long life! A long life!

The East is red, the sun rises, we raise the red flag, and look towards Beijing. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! At the time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, initiated and led by you, has achieved decisive victories, and when the new revolutionary committees are emerging in triumphant songs, you, dear Chairman, have once again kindly summoned us to the capital to study. Looking back on the two months we have spent studying by your side, they are indeed the most meaningful, happiest, and most unforgettable two months on our revolutionary journey. These extraordinary two months, we seemed to be following in your footsteps, looking at your towering figure standing tall and firm, fighting on the Long March, and living by the Yan River. These extraordinary two months, we are in the "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" of the 1960s, studying your theories, lines, policies, methods, and strategies for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, studying your latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Our minds are clear, our eyes are bright, and our resolve is firmer. Our revolutionary shoulders are stronger.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Countless revolutionary practices have repeatedly proven this unshakable truth: following you is victory. We will forever take Vice Chairman Lin as our example, holding a "loyal" heart towards you, and grasping a "use" of your brilliant thoughts. We will forever be loyal to you, forever loyal to your brilliant thoughts, forever loyal to your proletarian revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Your profound summary of the great significance and class content of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has further pointed out the direction for us to advance.

The Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, along with their agents in Northeast and Liaoning-Shenyang regions, and the traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries hiding in the revolutionary ranks, are all agents of the Kuomintang reactionaries, agents of imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. We are determined to hold high the great red flag of your brilliant thoughts, advance in victory, launch a proactive attack on the class enemies, and carry out a sustained revolutionary criticism, giving them no chance to breathe, until we criticize them thoroughly, overthrow them, and eliminate their counter-revolutionary revisionist poison. We will root out all counter-revolutionaries and will not rest until we achieve complete victory.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You have taught us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really powerful." We deeply understand that the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to complete victory, the more complex and profound the class struggle becomes. The handful of diehard capitalist roaders and traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries within the Party will not give up. They will adopt various forms to continue their sabotage and disruption. We must firmly remember your great teaching of "never forget class struggle," heighten our revolutionary vigilance, and uphold and carry forward the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution. No matter what tricks the class enemies play, from the right or the extreme "left," we will give them a crushing blow, and we will defend your proletarian revolutionary line to the death, seizing the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You have taught us: "Organizing tens of millions of people, mobilizing a vast revolutionary army, is the need of today's revolution to attack counter-revolution." We will firmly remember your great teaching, unite our class ranks, unite and win over allies, strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, strengthen military-civilian unity, and unite the vast majority. On the basis of your brilliant thoughts, we will further consolidate and develop the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the revolutionary masses, seize the revolution, promote production, promote work, promote preparedness, and seize new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You trust the masses the most and rely on the masses the most. We will not disappoint your dear Chairman's sincere expectations. We will definitely follow your great strategic deployment and write a magnificent new chapter of struggle for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　红心向着红太阳
　　在京参加毛泽东思想学习班的沈阳市联合指挥部代表
    八日，我们的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲切地接见了我们。这是我们一生中最大的幸福，最大的光荣。毛主席啊，毛主席！在这最难忘最激动的时刻，让我们衷心敬祝您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    东方红，太阳升，举红旗，望北京。毛主席啊，毛主席！在您亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的时候，在新生的革命委员会联翩出现的凯歌声中，您老人家又亲切地召唤我们来到首都学习。回顾在您老人家身边学习的两个月，实在是我们在革命道路上最有意义、最幸福、最难忘的两个月。这不平凡的两个月，我们仿佛踏着您老人家的足迹，望着您老人家顶天立地的身影，战斗在长征路上，生活在延水河边。这不平凡的两个月，我们是在六十年代的“抗大”，学习了您老人家在无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，学习了您老人家关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列最新指示，我们心明、眼亮、志更坚，革命双肩增力量。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！无数的革命实践，反复证明了这样一条颠扑不破的真理：紧跟您就是胜利。我们要永远以林副统帅为榜样，对您老人家心怀一个“忠”字，对您的光辉思想狠抓一个“用”字，永远忠于您，永远忠于您的光辉思想，永远忠于您的无产阶级革命路线。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”您对无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义和阶级内容所作的最深刻的概括，为我们进一步指明了前进的方向。
    中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在东北、辽沈地区的代理人和隐藏在革命队伍里的叛徒、特务、反革命分子，就是国民党反动派的代理人，就是帝国主义、资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右的代理人。我们决心更高地举起您的光辉思想的伟大红旗，乘胜前进，向阶级敌人主动进攻，持久地开展革命的大批判，绝不给他们喘气的机会，直到把他们批深批透，斗倒斗臭，彻底肃清他们的反革命修正主义流毒，把一切反革命分子统统挖出来，不获全胜，决不罢休。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您教导我们：“一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。”我们深深懂得，无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，阶级斗争就越复杂，越深刻。党内一小撮顽固不化的走资派和叛徒、特务、一切反革命分子，他们人还在，心不死，他们必将采取各种形式，继续进行破坏和捣乱。我们一定牢记您“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，百倍提高革命警惕，坚持和发扬无产阶级彻底革命精神，不管阶级敌人是从右的方面还是从极“左”方面来的种种阴谋破坏，我们都坚决地给以毁灭性的打击，誓死保卫您的无产阶级革命路线，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您教导我们：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要”。我们一定牢记您的这一伟大教导，团结自己的阶级队伍，团结和争取同盟军，加强工农联盟，加强军民团结，团结绝大多数人。在您的光辉思想的原则基础上，进一步巩固和发展无产阶级革命派的革命大联合和革命三结合，抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您最相信群众，最依靠群众，我们绝不辜负您老人家的殷切期望，一定紧跟您的伟大战略部署，为无产阶级文化大革命谱写出瑰丽的战斗新篇章！
