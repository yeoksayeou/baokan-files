The armed struggle for liberation by the people of the "Portuguese" colonies in Africa is intensifying. Recently, reports of victories by guerrilla forces against the colonialists have been coming in from "Portuguese" Guinea, Mozambique, and Angola.

In "Portuguese" Guinea in West Africa, the patriotic armed forces, which have already liberated about half of the country, have been actively launching attacks on the Portuguese colonial troops holed up in various outposts, annihilating large numbers of enemy forces. In March, the guerrilla forces attacked seven enemy outposts and camps, killing 135 enemy soldiers and officers, destroying four enemy vehicles, and seizing a large amount of weapons. On April 10, the patriotic armed forces destroyed a Portuguese camp in Kantakonda in the north. In the battle, six enemy soldiers were killed, eleven were captured, and a batch of weapons and military supplies, including mortars, rocket launchers, and radio equipment, were seized.

The Portuguese colonial troops, who have retreated into the cities, sometimes, with the support of aircraft and warships, raid the liberated areas in an attempt to retake some places, but they are always met with fierce resistance from the local people and military, and flee in disarray.

Since the armed uprising in September 1964, the people of Mozambique have controlled vast areas in the northeastern provinces of Niassa and Delgado. They frequently attack isolated enemy outposts and the road between the Metangula military base and the provincial capital of Vila Cabral in Niassa, making the enemy tremble with fear whenever they set foot on this road.

Recently, the guerrilla activities in the northeastern region of Mozambique have intensified. According to a statement issued by the guerrilla forces on April 23, the guerrillas attacked an enemy camp in Namoto, destroyed a "strategic village" in Anga, and conducted five ambushes in the areas of Pondanharl and Chivondondo. In these battles, the guerrillas killed more than sixty Portuguese colonial soldiers, blew up five military vehicles, and seized a large number of weapons, ammunition, and military equipment.

According to reports, the armed forces of Mozambique have recently intensified their activities in the northwestern province of Tete, causing great alarm among the Portuguese colonial authorities and the South African apartheid regime that supports them. At the rapids of the Zambezi River in Tete, the South African and Portuguese colonial authorities are planning to build a hydroelectric power project to supply electricity to the capital of the South African regime, Pretoria. Pinto Bessa, the Portuguese colonial military chief in Mozambique, who was trained by the Americans, recently anxiously sensed that Cabora Bassa would become "a new target for the Mozambique guerrillas."

The people of Angola, who were the first to launch an armed struggle in the "Portuguese" colonies in Africa, have been fighting for eight years. The areas controlled and operated by the Angolan guerrillas are expanding day by day. They are very active in the Kwanza region and the vast areas in the east and southeast of Angola. Recently, they have intensified their attacks on the Benguela Railway that runs through central Angola, threatening the enemy's transportation.

The guerrillas active on both sides of the Benguela Railway and in the southeastern region have recently intensified their attacks on enemy troops in Dala, Luena, and Cazombo. From late March to early April, they killed and wounded sixty enemy soldiers and seized a batch of weapons, ammunition, and military supplies. On February 26, the guerrillas in Kwanza destroyed a Portuguese camp in Sangu-Mongo, killing forty Portuguese colonial soldiers in one go.

　　游击队捷报频传　殖民军大量被歼
　　非洲“葡属”殖民地人民武装斗争深入发展
　　“葡属”几内亚、莫三鼻给和安哥拉游击战士加强战斗使敌丧胆
    新华社讯　非洲“葡属”殖民地人民争取解放的武装斗争正在深入开展。最近，从“葡属”几内亚、莫三鼻给和安哥拉，不断传来人民游击队打击殖民主义者的捷报。
    在西非的“葡属”几内亚，已经解放了全国约一半领土的爱国武装不断主动出击，进攻困守在一些据点里的葡萄牙殖民军队，大量消灭敌人的有生力量。在今年三月份游击队对七个地方的敌军据点和兵营的袭击中，打死敌军官兵一百三十五名，击毁四辆敌军车辆，缴获了大批武器。四月十日，爱国武装力量又摧毁了在北部坎塔孔达的葡萄牙兵营。在战斗中，打死敌人六名，俘虏十一名，还缴获了包括迫击炮、火箭筒和收发报机在内的一批武器和军用物资。
    龟缩在城市里的葡萄牙殖民军队，有时也在飞机和舰艇的支持下，窜犯解放区，妄图夺回一些地方，但都遭到解放区军民的迎头痛击，丢盔弃甲狼狈逃回。
    莫三鼻给人民从一九六四年九月举行武装起义以来，已经控制了莫三鼻给东北部的尼亚萨和德尔加多角两个省的广大地区。他们经常袭击这一地区的一些孤立的敌军据点以及梅坦古拉军事基地到尼亚萨省首府维拉卡布拉尔之间的公路，使敌人一踏上这条公路就感到胆战心惊。
    最近，莫三鼻给游击队在东北地区的活动又不断加强。据游击队四月二十三日的一次公报说，游击队袭击了敌人在纳莫托的一个兵营，捣毁了在昂加的一座“战略村”，并在朋当哈尔和齐沃农多等地区进行了五次伏击。在这几次战斗中，游击队打死了葡萄牙殖民军六十多名，炸毁了军车五辆，缴获了许多武器、弹药和军事装备。
    据报道，莫三鼻给人民武装最近又重新在西北部的太特省加强活动，这更引起葡萄牙殖民当局和支持它的南非种族主义当局的恐慌。在流经太特省的赞比西河的卡布拉巴萨急流处，南非和葡萄牙殖民当局准备在那里兴建一项水力发电工程，以便向南非当局首都比勒陀利亚输送电力。受美国训练的在莫三鼻给的葡萄牙殖民军参谋长平托·贝萨最近惶惶不安地预感到，卡布拉巴萨将成为莫三鼻给游击队进攻的“一个新的目标”。
    在非洲“葡属”殖民地中最先发动武装斗争的安哥拉人民，已经坚持战斗了八个年头。安哥拉游击队控制和活动的地区正在日益扩大。他们在喀奔达地区和安哥拉东部和东南部的广大地区十分活跃。最近，他们加强对横贯安哥拉中部的本格拉铁路的袭击，使得敌人的运输受到威胁。
    活跃在本格拉铁路两侧和东南部地区的游击队，最近在达拉、卢埃纳和卡宗博等地加强袭击敌军。从三月下旬到四月上旬，打死打伤敌军六十名，缴获一批武器、弹药和军用物资。二月二十六日，战斗在喀奔达的游击队摧毁了在桑加—蒙戈的葡萄牙兵营，一举打死了四十名葡萄牙殖民军。（附图片）
