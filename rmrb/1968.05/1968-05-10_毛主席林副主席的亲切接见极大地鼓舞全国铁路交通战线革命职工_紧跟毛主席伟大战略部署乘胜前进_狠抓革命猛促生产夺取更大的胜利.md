Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's warm reception greatly inspired the revolutionary workers on the national railway and transportation front. Following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we will advance victoriously, grasp the revolution, promote production, and achieve greater victories.

On the railway and transportation front, the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army who are carrying out the "three supports, two militaries" tasks are determined to work with the broad revolutionary workers to grasp class struggle, deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism, and achieve new victories in the great struggle for the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

New China News Agency, May 9th: The great news that our great teacher and leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin received revolutionary warriors from all over the country and representatives of revolutionary workers attending the national railway and transportation conference on the 8th greatly inspired the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres on the national railway and transportation front. They expressed that they must, under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, grasp the revolution, promote production, and achieve the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

From last night to today, on the railways, highways, and waterways across the country, at stations and ports, there was a festive atmosphere everywhere. The thrilling news from the capital Beijing inspired the revolutionary workers on the railway and transportation front. They were overjoyed and spread the news, shouting thousands of times: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" The great leader Chairman Mao is in excellent health, which is the greatest happiness for the revolutionary people of the whole country! Chairman Mao receiving our representatives is the greatest concern, greatest inspiration, and greatest encouragement for the working class of our country! The broad revolutionary workers, with their profound proletarian feelings of being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, sincerely wish the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life! They shouted enthusiastically again and again: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

When the news reached the Shanghai Railway Bureau, the dispatchers immediately used the dispatch telephone to convey the news to all revolutionary workers in the bureau. The entire bureau's lines and stations were in an uproar! When the news reached the Guangzhou Railway Bureau, many workers who had already gone home from work rushed from all directions to the square of the railway bureau building and immediately held a celebration meeting. The leading members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Tianjin Port Bureau ran through various work shifts at night to convey the news, and many units held celebration meetings. When the news reached ships sailing on the rivers, lakes, and seas of the motherland, the revolutionary workers and the broad passengers sang "The East Is Red" together in high spirits. Wherever the news reached, there was a festive atmosphere. Many revolutionary workers held meetings at night, shared their thoughts, made resolutions, and planned, standing in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and solemnly swearing: "Forever follow Chairman Mao to make the revolution, even if the sea dries up and the stones crumble, our hearts will not change! We must grasp the revolution, promote production, and create greater achievements, and we will not disappoint Chairman Mao's concern and expectations!"

The broad revolutionary workers, in the happy moment of warmly welcoming Chairman Mao's reception of the great news, are determined to grasp the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, advance victoriously, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end. The driver of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive at the Fengtai Locomotive Section of the Beijing Railway Bureau, Chen Fuhan, said, "Vice Chairman Lin instructed us in his inscription on the 20th anniversary of the naming of the 'Mao Zedong' locomotive: 'The people's revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of historical progress.' The Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao is a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev and other top walkers in the Party and their agents in the railway department, and thoroughly eliminate all the poison of revisionism they spread. The broad revolutionary workers of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, with the glorious revolutionary tradition of 'February 7th,' expressed that they must further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, resolutely oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary wind of reversing cases blown by the class enemy, and dig out all hidden traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries. On the thousand-mile Yangtze River waterway and along the highways in the northwestern plateau and the southwestern region, many revolutionary waterway workers, dock workers, and transportation workers expressed that they must closely follow the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, further implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary tripartite combination, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units, and achieve the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

The great news of Chairman Mao's reception came, and the broad revolutionary workers immediately turned Chairman Mao's warm concern into a great driving force for grasping the revolution and promoting production. The revolutionary workers of the 18 railway bureaus across the country, including Beijing, Shenyang, Shanghai, Zhengzhou, Jinan, Jinzhou, Harbin, Guangzhou, Lanzhou, Nanchang, Qiqihar, Jilin, Hohhot, Liuzhou, Chengdu, Xi'an, Urumqi, and Kunming, all expressed that they must strive to catch up and surpass, advance victoriously, and create greater achievements in grasping the revolution and promoting production. The revolutionary workers of the Harbin and Jinzhou Railway Bureaus, with their hearts full of excitement, created excellent results of punctual departure and running of passenger trains in the night of the 8th. The loading workers of the Harbin Railway Bureau were full of enthusiasm, and on the 9th, they loaded 88 more cars than planned. The revolutionary workers of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's warm concern, reported production victories from various stations and sections on the night of the 8th. The locomotives of the Shanghai Locomotive Section were all safe and punctual this night, saving 14 tons of coal. The driver of a train from Xining to Hohhot, after hearing the news during the journey, created a record of overloading by 733 tons with the revolutionary spirit of "resolving to overcome all difficulties and win victory." The broad revolutionary workers of the Wuwei Railway Sub-bureau in Gansu, who completed the April transportation task ahead of schedule and over-fulfilled it, expressed at the celebration meeting that they would, with greater determination and greater enthusiasm, achieve new victories in revolution and production. The broad revolutionary workers of the Nanning Railway Sub-bureau and the Zhangdian Locomotive Section of the Jinan Railway Bureau expressed that "grasp the revolution, promote production, work, and prepare for war" is Chairman Mao's great strategic policy, an important aspect of our achieving the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution, and we must resolutely implement it.

When the news reached the Qingdao Port Bureau, it was the time for the night shift to hand over to the day shift. The dock was in a festive atmosphere. The workers turned the shift handover meeting into a meeting to express their determination to the great leader Chairman Mao. Many workers who had finished their shifts did not leave and fought together with the workers on duty for another shift. The dock workers of Qingdao Port loaded and unloaded 3,000 tons more goods today. The night shift workers of Shanghai Port on the 8th completed 165.2% of their shift's production plan. The revolutionary workers of Tianjin New Port today over-fulfilled the daily loading and unloading task by 12%, creating the highest daily loading and unloading record since this year. The revolutionary workers of the Qinhuangdao Port Bureau completed 40% of the monthly throughput plan in the first nine days of this month. They discussed the plan for grasping the revolution and promoting production again today and are determined to achieve greater victories. The First Highway Engineering Bureau today issued a call to all revolutionary workers in the bureau to hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to launch a fierce attack on the enemies of the proletariat, use the revolution to promote production, and launch a new high tide of grasping the revolution and promoting production. The revolutionary workers fighting on the highways in the southwestern region said, "We will turn Chairman Mao's warm concern for us highway workers into boundless wisdom and strength, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and achieve greater victories in revolution and production."

The broad soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army who are carrying out the "three supports, two militaries" tasks on the railway and transportation front across the country were immersed in unprecedented happiness after hearing the news. They immediately put up wall newspapers, wrote blackboard newspapers, posted big red notices, and prepared cultural performances, using various forms to spread this great news to the local revolutionary masses and express their profound proletarian feelings of loving the great leader Chairman Mao. They expressed that they must learn from the revolutionary workers on the railway and transportation front who have made great contributions in the Cultural Revolution, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, better implement Chairman Mao's great call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad leftist masses, work with the broad revolutionary workers to grasp the revolution, promote production, and achieve new victories in the great struggle for the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.
