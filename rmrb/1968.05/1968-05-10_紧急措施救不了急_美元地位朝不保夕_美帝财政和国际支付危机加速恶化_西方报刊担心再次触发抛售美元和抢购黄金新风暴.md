Despite the Johnson administration's efforts to save the dollar's position, which has been in a precarious state, a series of important signs indicate that the U.S. domestic fiscal crisis and international payment crisis are worsening, making the dollar's position even more uncertain.

On April 19, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, William Martin, admitted with a heavy heart that the U.S. is facing the most severe fiscal crisis since 1931. He said, "The U.S. is facing an intolerable budget deficit and an intolerable international trade deficit." Martin's helpless lament fully reflects the American ruling class's desperation in the face of the deepening financial crisis, and this has caused great shock and panic throughout the capitalist world.

To cope with the severe inflation caused by the huge budget deficit, the Federal Reserve Board, led by Martin, announced on April 18 that it would raise the discount rate (the interest rate at which the Federal Reserve lends to commercial banks) from 5% to 5.5%, reaching the highest point since the 1929 crisis. This is the third time the U.S. has raised the discount rate since the devaluation of the pound last November. The U.S. government had to take such extraordinary measures, reflecting the seriousness of the situation. Officials admit that tightening the money supply by raising the discount rate is the "only way" to ease inflationary pressures at present.

At the same time, the U.S. international balance of payments situation is deteriorating further. Preliminary estimates indicate that the first quarter's balance of payments deficit is expected to reach around $1.2 billion, equivalent to an annual rate of $4.8 billion (last year it was $3.575 billion). This will undoubtedly further undermine the "credit" of the dollar.

According to reports, one of the main factors contributing to the deterioration of the U.S. balance of payments in the first quarter is that due to the worsening domestic inflation, prices have risen rapidly, weakening the competitiveness of U.S. goods and causing a sharp decline in the U.S. trade surplus. The trade surplus for the first three months of this year, calculated on an annual basis, has dropped to just over $700 million (last year's trade surplus was $4 billion, and the year before it was $7 billion); in March, foreign trade even saw its first deficit in five years.

It is against this backdrop that the price of gold in the London free market has been rising since mid-April, reaching $39.65 per ounce by April 29. Some Western newspapers have expressed concern that when the official figures for the first quarter's balance of payments deficit are announced in mid-May, it could trigger a new wave of dollar selling and gold buying, putting the dollar's fate to another severe "test."

Faced with this critical situation, the American ruling class is in a state of panic. On April 26, Johnson convened a meeting of senior economic advisers to discuss the situation. It is reported that the meeting mainly discussed the inflation problem and the "very disappointing" foreign trade situation. On the 30th, Johnson submitted a special message to Congress, urging it to quickly approve the plan for the International Monetary Fund to establish Special Drawing Rights, attempting to use this "paper gold" trick to calm people's hearts and maintain the dollar's shaky position.

　　紧急措施救不了急　美元地位朝不保夕
　　美帝财政和国际支付危机加速恶化
　　西方报刊担心再次触发抛售美元和抢购黄金新风暴
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：尽管美国约翰逊政府今年来挖空心思，为抢救处在风雨飘摇中的美元地位采取了种种紧急措施，但是一系列重要迹象表明，美国国内财政危机和国际支付危机仍在加速恶化，使美元地位更加朝不保夕。
    四月十九日，美国金融界重要头目“联邦储备委员会”主席马丁黯然承认，美国“正处于一九三一年以来最严重的财政危机中”。他说，美国“面临不能容忍的预算赤字，也面临不能容忍的国际收支逆差”。马丁的这番无可奈何的哀叹，充分反映了为日益深重的金融危机而伤透脑筋的美国统治集团一筹莫展的窘态，这在整个资本主义世界引起了极大的震动和恐慌。
    为了应付巨大的财政预算赤字引起的严重通货膨胀，马丁领导的美国“联邦储备委员会”在四月十八日宣布把贴现率（即联邦储备银行向各商业银行放款的利率）由百分之五提高到百分之五点五，达到一九二九年大危机以来的最高点。这是自从去年十一月英镑贬值以来，美国第三次提高贴现率。美国官方不得不采取这样的非常措施，反映出了局势的严重性。官方承认，通过提高贴现率来收缩银根，这是当前减轻通货膨胀压力的“唯一办法”。
    在这同时，美国的国际收支情况在进一步加速恶化。据初步估计，今年第一季度的国际收支逆差额预计将达到十二亿美元左右，折合年率高达四十八亿美元（去年为三十五亿七千五百万美元）。这无疑将使美元“信用”进一步破产。
    据报道，引起第一季度美国国际收支状况进一步恶化的一个主要因素是：由于美国国内通货膨胀加剧，物价迅速上涨，削弱了美国商品的竞争能力，使美国的对外贸易顺差猛降。今年头三个月的外贸顺差数字折合年率计算，降到只剩七亿多美元（去年的贸易顺差是四十亿美元，前年是七十亿美元）；三月份外贸甚至出现了五年来的第一次逆差。
    正是在这种背景下，伦敦黄金自由市场金价自四月中旬以来节节上涨，到四月二十九日已经涨到每盎斯三十九点六五美元。一些西方报刊表示担心，到五月中旬美国第一季度国际收支逆差的正式数字公布时，可能再次触发抛售美元、抢购黄金的新风暴，美元命运将再次受到严峻的“考验”。
    面对着这种危急局面，美国统治集团十分恐慌。美帝头子约翰逊在四月二十六日召集高级经济顾问举行紧急会议，研究局势，据透露，会议主要讨论了通货膨胀问题，和“令人非常失望的”对外贸易情况。三十日，约翰逊向国会提出一项特别咨文，催促国会尽快批准“国际货币基金组织”设立“特别提款权”的方案，妄图用这种发行“纸上黄金”的骗人花招来安定人心，维持美元摇摇欲坠的地位。
