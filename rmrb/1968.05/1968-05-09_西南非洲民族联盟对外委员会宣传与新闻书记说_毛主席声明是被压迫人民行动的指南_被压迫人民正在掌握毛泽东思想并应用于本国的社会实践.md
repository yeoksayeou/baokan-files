The External Affairs Committee of the Southwest African People's Organization on Propaganda and News Says Chairman Mao's Statement is a Guide for the Actions of Oppressed Peoples, Who Are Grasping Mao Zedong Thought and Applying It to Their National Social Practices

	New China News Agency, Stockholm, May 7

	The External Affairs Committee of the Southwest African People's Organization on Propaganda and News, Moses Kagongo, said in a written interview with a New China News Agency reporter today that Chairman Mao's statement in support of the struggle of American blacks against violence is "a great source of inspiration for the oppressed peoples of the world."

	He said, "Chairman Mao's statement is a great support for American blacks and points out the correct direction for their struggle. This statement reflects the resolute support of the 700 million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, for the struggle of American blacks."

	He pointed out that Chairman Mao has revealed the social roots of American racism and scientifically explained the relationship between the struggle of the American people against monopolistic capitalism and the struggle of the peoples of the world against imperialism and for people's democracy.

	He condemned the actions of the Soviet revisionist leadership in serving American imperialism. He pointed out that the Soviet revisionists are playing tricks and trying to castrate the class nature of the struggle of American blacks.

	He emphasized, "Chairman Mao has raised the scientific theory of proletarian revolution to a new level. Chairman Mao is the great helmsman and supreme commander of the proletariat. Chairman Mao creatively applies Marxism-Leninism to solve the problems of proletarian revolution and national revolution under new and complex conditions. Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist thinker and theorist of our time. Millions of oppressed peoples and nations are beginning to grasp Mao Zedong Thought and apply it to their national social practices."

	He concluded, "The Southwest African People's Organization firmly supports Chairman Mao's statement. We believe this statement is a call to arms for all those who want to oppose American imperialism and persist in the revolutionary struggle. We will study Chairman Mao's statement as an important document and use it as a guide to action. Chairman Mao's statement is a weapon to dispel all illusions about the nature of imperialism and its running dogs. We are convinced that the problem of world revolution can only be solved by creatively applying the strategies and tactics formulated by Chairman Mao."

	He concluded with a shout: "Let the peoples of all countries follow the path illuminated by Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao!"

	The statement by Chairman Mao in support of the struggle of American blacks against violence inspires the liberation struggle of the world's proletariat and oppressed peoples. Greek sailors excitedly hold up Chairman Mao's great statement and shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"
