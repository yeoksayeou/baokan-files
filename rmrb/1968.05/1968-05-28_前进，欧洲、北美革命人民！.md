	Onward, Revolutionary People of Europe and North America!

	Gales roar and thunder rolls. From Europe and North America come thrilling news. In the heart of the capitalist world, the people are awakening anew, and the revolutionary struggle is surging forward. Especially in France, workers are striking, students are boycotting classes, and the flames of resistance are swiftly spreading across the nation. The momentum, scale, and speed of development are unprecedented in the major capitalist countries since World War II.

	The new surge in the revolutionary struggles of the people of Europe and North America is excellent! The mighty student movement and the worker movement are gradually converging, with the broad masses of young students and workers uniting closely, supporting each other, and fighting side by side, displaying tremendous power.

	The new surge in the revolutionary struggles of the people of Europe and North America is excellent! It has greatly dampened the arrogance of imperialism and fiercely assaulted the reactionary rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie. It has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people. The revolutionary storm rising in the lair of imperialism and colonialism powerfully supports and inspires the struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations around the world to achieve liberation. As our great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "The people of the world, unite more closely, and launch a sustained and powerful offensive against our common enemy, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys! It can be confidently said that the thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all exploitative systems, and the complete emancipation of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world, are not far off."

	The new surge in the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries in Europe and North America is excellent! Like the raging waves of the sea, it has washed out all kinds of traitors and scabs, further exposing the ugly face of modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique. As soon as the new storm of the French workers' movement arose, the French revisionist clique issued a statement, threatening the revolutionary masses not to be influenced by any "adventurist" slogans of various kinds. The Soviet revisionist clique, with evil intentions and yet cowardly, had TASS falsely speaking through the mouth of the French revisionists, "warning" the revolutionary people not to take "adventurist actions" that would only bring losses to the process of the high tide of the French democratic movement. These clumsy performances are nothing but a few flies buzzing against the wall in the face of the earth-shaking storm of the people's revolution.

	The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries in Europe and North America and believe that their struggles will definitely achieve final victory. Workers and revolutionary youths of Europe and North America, fight on bravely! Advance courageously!

    前进，欧洲、北美革命人民！
    通信兵机关无产阶级革命派
    狂飚阵阵，春雷滚滚。欧洲、北美传来了振奋人心的讯息。在资本主义世界的心脏地区，人民群众出现了新的觉醒，革命斗争出现了新的高涨。特别是在法国，工人罢工，学生罢课，反抗怒火迅速燃遍全国。其声势之猛，规模之大，发展之快，是第二次世界大战以后主要资本主义国家中所罕见的。
    欧洲、北美人民革命斗争的新高涨好得很！声势浩大的学生运动和工人运动逐步相汇合，广大青年学生和广大工人群众紧密团结，相互支持，并肩战斗，显示了巨大的力量。
    欧洲、北美人民革命斗争的新高涨好得很！它大灭了帝国主义的威风，猛烈地冲击着垄断资产阶级的反动统治。它大长了革命人民的志气。在帝国主义、殖民主义的老巢兴起的革命风暴，有力地支持和鼓舞了世界上一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的斗争。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席最近所指出的：“全世界人民更紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻！可以肯定，殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃，世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的彻底翻身，已经为期不远了。”
    欧洲、北美各国人民革命斗争的新高涨好得很！它象大海的怒涛，把那些形形色色的叛徒、工贼冲刷了出来，进一步暴露了以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义的丑恶面目。法国工人运动新风暴刚刚兴起，法修叛徒集团就发表声明，威胁革命群众不要受什么“形形色色冒险主义”口号的影响。苏修叛徒集团心怀鬼胎而又做贼心虚，由塔斯社假借法修之口，“警告”革命人民“不要采取只会给法国民主运动高涨的过程带来损失的冒险主义行动”。这些拙劣的表演，在惊天动地的群众革命大风暴面前，只不过是象几个苍蝇碰壁嗡嗡叫而已。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，坚决支持欧洲、北美各国人民的革命斗争，并且相信他们的斗争一定会取得最后胜利。欧洲、北美的工人兄弟们和革命青年们，再接再厉地战斗吧！奋勇地前进吧！
