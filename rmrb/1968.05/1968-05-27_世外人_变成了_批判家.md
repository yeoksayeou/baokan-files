In Guyuan County, the Binghezi Brigade of the Dahuzi Production Team has a poor peasant named An Sanmao. In the past, he was someone who "did not hear what was happening outside his window and did not touch other people's work," and people called him an "outsider."

The surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution powerfully impacted him. He felt that he could no longer live in ignorance as he had in the past. After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," he became even more restless.

Last winter, he heard that the army was going to help the brigade set up a Mao Zedong Thought study class, so he immediately offered his own house as the classroom. In the study class, he listened to the poor and lower-middle peasants' angry denunciations and criticisms of China's Khrushchev, and his heart burned with rage. He recalled how he had been poisoned by China's Khrushchev in the past, and during the criticism meeting, he fired shot after shot at China's Khrushchev. He angrily said, "In the past, I believed in China's Khrushchev's 'cultivation of morality and character' nonsense. Now I realize that he was just trying to confuse us, making us forget proletarian politics, forget class and class struggle, and follow him down the wrong path! From now on, I will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, care about state affairs, farm for the revolution, and work for the collective."

The blazing fire of revolutionary criticism burned away the "self" in his mind, and he used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide his actions. Last winter, he often braved temperatures of minus thirty degrees, getting up early and staying up late to fetch water for military families and the five guarantees. The well was icy, and someone reminded him to be careful so as not to get hurt. He said seriously, "If I only take care of myself, that would be exactly what China's Khrushchev wants. That is absolutely not allowed. Chairman Mao wants us to do good deeds for the people all our lives. No matter how difficult it is, I will do it to the end." The sheep pen was not far from his home, and he also took care of it. One night, there was a strong wind, and he heard the bleating of the lambs, fearing that the collective's sheep would be harmed, so he got out of bed and went to the sheep pen, bringing the lambs back home and placing them on the warm kang. Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, An Sanmao became a different person. The poor and lower-middle peasants affectionately called him a "critic" and a "red manager," and no one called him an "outsider" anymore.

### “世外人”变成了“批判家”

    “世外人”变成了“批判家”
    在沽源县，大河子大队冰号营子生产队有个贫农社员叫安三茂。过去他是“两耳不闻窗外事，双手不沾他人活”，人们管他叫“世外人”。
    无产阶级文化大革命的滚滚洪流，有力地冲击了他。他觉得自己再也不能象过去那样糊里糊涂地过日子了。毛主席发出“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大号召后，他更坐立不住了。
    去年冬天，他听说解放军要帮助队上开办毛泽东思想学习班，就马上把自己的屋子让出来作为课堂。在学习班里，他听了贫下中农对中国赫鲁晓夫的愤怒声讨和批判，胸中顿时燃起了团团怒火。他想起过去自己受过中国赫鲁晓夫的毒害，便在批判会上向中国赫鲁晓夫放出了一发发炮弹。他气愤地说：“过去我相信中国赫鲁晓夫‘修身养性’那一套，现在我才明白原来他是在给我们灌迷魂汤，让我们成为忘记无产阶级政治，忘记阶级和阶级斗争的糊涂虫，跟着他往邪道上跑！我今后一定听毛主席的话，关心国家大事，为革命种田，为集体出力。”
    革命大批判的熊熊烈火烧掉了他头脑里的“私”字，他用战无不胜的毛泽东思想指导自己的行动。去年冬天，他经常冒着零下三十多度的严寒，起早摸黑给军属、五保户挑水。井台冰滑，有人提醒他小心自己出危险。他十分认真地说：“光顾自己，正合了中国赫鲁晓夫的心意，这万万不行。毛主席要咱们一辈子为人民做好事，再难我也要做到底。”队里的羊圈离他家不远，他也操上了一份心。有天夜里刮大风，他听见小羊羔的叫声，担心集体的羊群受损失，就从被窝里爬起来摸到羊圈，把小羊抱回家，放在热炕头上。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，安三茂变成了另一个人，贫下中农都亲切地称他是“批判家”、“红管家”，再也听不见有人叫他“世外人”了。
