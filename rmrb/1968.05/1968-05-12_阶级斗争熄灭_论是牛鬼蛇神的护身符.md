The great leader Chairman Mao says: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never reconcile themselves to their defeat. They will still make their last desperate efforts. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and sabotage in various ways every day and every hour, and they will try to restore their rule in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and undeniable. We must never relax our vigilance." The facts of class struggle in our brigade prove that Chairman Mao's teachings are extremely wise and correct.

During the period of temporary economic difficulties in our country, the Chinese Khrushchev spread the black wind of "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms." The reactionary Kuomintang in Taiwan also raved about "counterattacking the mainland." A landlord in our production team thought that the time to "change the sky" had come, and openly jumped out to stir up trouble, leading the landlord's children to inspect fields, houses, and mountains, and keep accounts for the "change of the sky." He also tried every means to sabotage the consolidation and development of the collective economy. He even carried out vicious counter-revolutionary revenge and class revenge against the poor and lower-middle peasants. In this great Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, the broad revolutionary masses exposed the Chinese Khrushchev, and this landlord knew that the situation was unfavorable to him, so he became even more rampant in his sabotage and sabotage. He spread rumors everywhere, engaged in feudal superstition activities, and engaged in speculation, trying to sabotage the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. These living facts fully prove that the nature of the class enemy will not change, and class struggle has not been extinguished but is still raging fiercely.

The Chinese Khrushchev, however, vigorously promoted the theory of "extinction of class struggle," claiming that "capitalists, landlords, and rich peasants will all enter socialism." "There are no landlords and capitalists anymore," "There is no class struggle in our country anymore." This is all deceitful nonsense, a shield for monsters and demons, and a poison to lull us poor and lower-middle peasants. The theory of "extinction of class struggle" wants us to disarm our minds, abandon class struggle, and engage in "peaceful coexistence" with the class enemy. The theory of "extinction of class struggle" is to let all monsters and demons come out and restore capitalism. If their plot succeeds, it will cause the heads of thousands and millions of people to fall, and we poor and lower-middle peasants will have to go back to the old road and suffer twice.

We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Never forget class struggle." We must talk about class struggle every year, every month, and every day, raise our class consciousness high, deepen our hatred for the class enemy, and constantly carry out struggles against the enemy, thoroughly smashing the Chinese Khrushchev's dream of restoring capitalism.

    “阶级斗争熄灭”论是牛鬼蛇神的护身符
    第六生产队贫协组长　方尚怀
    伟大领袖毛主席说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”我们大队阶级斗争的事实，证明毛主席的教导非常英明非常正确。
    在我国暂时经济困难时期，中国赫鲁晓夫刮起了“三自一包”、“四大自由”的黑风，盘踞在台湾的国民党反动派也疯狂地叫嚣“反攻大陆”。我们生产队的一个地主分子以为“变天”时机已到，公开跳出来兴风作浪，带着地主子弟查看田地、房屋、山林，记“变天账”。他还千方百计地破坏集体经济的巩固和发展。他甚至对贫下中农进行疯狂的反攻倒算和阶级报复。在这次伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命人民揪出了中国赫鲁晓夫，这个地主分子知道形势对他不利，就更加猖狂地进行破坏和捣乱。他到处制造谣言，大搞封建迷信活动，大搞投机买卖，妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命。这些活生生的事实，充分说明阶级敌人的本性是不会改变的，阶级斗争没有熄灭，正在激烈地进行着。
    中国赫鲁晓夫却大力宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论，胡说什么：“资本家、地主、富农都将进入社会主义。”“现在再也没有地主资产阶级了”，“我国再也没有阶级斗争了”。这完全是骗人的鬼话，是牛鬼蛇神的护身符，是麻痹我们贫下中农的毒剂。“阶级斗争熄灭”论，要我们解除思想武装，放弃阶级斗争，跟阶级敌人搞“和平共处”。“阶级斗争熄灭”论，就是妄想让牛鬼蛇神一齐跑了出来，复辟资本主义。如果让他们的阴谋得逞，那就会使千百万人头落地，我们贫下中农就要走回头路，吃二遍苦。
    我们要牢记毛主席的教导：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。要年年讲、月月讲、天天讲阶级斗争，把阶级觉悟提得高高的，把对阶级敌人的仇恨搞得深深的，经常开展对敌斗争，彻底粉碎中国赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦。
