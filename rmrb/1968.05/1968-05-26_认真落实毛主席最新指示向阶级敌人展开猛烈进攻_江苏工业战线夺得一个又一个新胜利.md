Jiangsu's industrial front has achieved one victory after another.

Since this year, the total industrial output value of the entire province has increased significantly month by month, and the production of many products has continued to rise, with quality continuously improving.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, May 25th: On the industrial front of Jiangsu Province, broad revolutionary workers and cadres, under the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. With class struggle as the key link, they have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and achieved one victory after another. Since this year, the total industrial output value of the entire province has increased significantly month by month. The production of major products such as locomotives and rolling stock, hand-held tractors, small diesel engines, fertilizers, pesticides, cement, machine-made paper, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, dyed fabric, knitted products, and daily necessities has continued to rise, with quality continuously improving.

The revolutionary and production situation on the industrial front of the entire province is the result of broad revolutionary workers actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, further enhancing their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, and firmly grasping class struggle. Under the assistance of the PLA's leftist support troops, broad revolutionary workers have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in essence, is a political revolution under socialist conditions, a revolution by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." They have sharpened their eyes, enhanced their class struggle awareness, and engaged in a head-to-head struggle with class enemies, exposing one after another the hidden handful of class enemies, and severely striking down the evil activities of these bad elements to sabotage production and revolution. This has greatly boosted the morale of broad revolutionary workers. After severely striking down the sabotage activities of class enemies, the entire factory of Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory has seen a completely new situation, with the production of various major products increasing month by month. The revolutionary workers of Nanjing Red Flag Cement Factory, in the process of grasping revolution and promoting production, have resolutely struck down the evil activities of a handful of class enemies to sabotage production, exceeding the production plans for March and April, and significantly improving the quality of cement.

Chairman Mao teaches us that "without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution. Destruction must be reasoned, and reasoning is construction. With destruction as the key, construction is also within it." Revolutionary workers on the industrial front of Jiangsu Province, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have raised the banner of revolutionary criticism, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and in combination with the actual class struggle in their regions and units, have carried out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism. In tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the province, in various regions and factories, broad revolutionary workers have used Chairman Mao's teachings as a weapon to thoroughly expose and criticize the crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, such as Liu Shaoqi, and to eliminate their influence, establishing revolutionary viewpoints. The revolutionary masses of Wuxi Agricultural Machinery Company, studying Chairman Mao's teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," exposed and criticized the crimes of a handful of capitalist-roaders who advocated "profit-first," firmly putting proletarian politics in command of business, wholeheartedly serving socialist agriculture, and completing this year's agricultural machinery repair and assembly tasks ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota. Recently, five units in Sheyang County—Yanma Cotton Ginning Factory, Cotton Inspection Station, Transportation Company, Moving Company, and Oil and Rice Mill (Warehouse)—which have close cooperative relationships in production, jointly held a Mao Zedong Thought study class. They exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of Liu Shaoqi in advocating the development of capitalist competition and sabotaging socialist cooperative relationships, effectively promoting production.

Broad revolutionary workers, with class struggle as the key link, while launching an offensive on the political front against class enemies, also launch an offensive on the production front, seizing double victories in revolution and production. Revolutionary workers in the textile industry of Wuxi City, following Chairman Mao's great teachings, have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, overcoming all difficulties, using various methods, using less coal and weaving more cloth, with the production of cotton yarn and cotton cloth increasing significantly month by month.

In the process of implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," revolutionary cadres on the industrial front of the entire province have stood at the forefront of class struggle and production struggle, closely connecting with the masses, fully mobilizing the masses, and playing a leading role.
