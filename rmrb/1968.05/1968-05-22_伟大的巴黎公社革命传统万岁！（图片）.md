The masses of Paris are holding high a ten-meter-long banner that reads, "Students, teachers, and workers unite!" as they march through the city center.

On May 20, the "Citroën" automobile factory in Paris was occupied by striking workers. The image shows the workers gathering outside the factory.

French students and teachers are bravely fighting against the decadent capitalist education system. The image shows Paris students holding a massive demonstration.

Paris students have risen up in rebellion and dared to fight back. They used cars to build barricades and bravely battled the police who came to suppress them.
