The Lancang River sings,
A golden phoenix flies over Awa Mountain;
We thank Chairman Mao for sending us the good army,
Bringing the thoughts of Mao Zedong to the people of the borderlands.

This is a folk song sung by the revolutionary masses of various ethnic groups in the Awa Mountain area of Yunnan Province, praising a transportation company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army.

The mule transportation company of a certain unit is an advanced unit in studying the works of Chairman Mao, and a company that has consecutively won the "Four Good" title for seven years. This company has been on duty along the border for years, traversing the rugged mountains of the borderlands, and has extensive contact with the people of various ethnic groups in the borderlands. Wherever they go, they enthusiastically propagate the thoughts of Mao Zedong to the people.

Every time they pass through a village or a hamlet, the first thing they do is to hang a portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao in the people's homes, so that the red sun will always shine over Awa Mountain.

Loving the people a thousand times, loving the people ten thousand times, making the people of the borderlands forever loyal to Chairman Mao, is the greatest love for the people. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, whenever Chairman Mao issued new instructions, whenever the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao issued new battle calls, they would immediately spread them from village to village and hamlet to hamlet, so that Chairman Mao's latest instructions would reach every corner of the borderlands.

One day, they transported a batch of agricultural materials to the four-sort mountain area of Awa Mountain and heard that this mountain area had once suffered severe damage from the "three selfs and one package" policy pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev. They immediately set up a revolutionary criticism battlefield on the high Awa Mountain. In 1958, the people of various ethnic groups in the four-sort mountain area responded to Chairman Mao's great call and established a cooperative. In 1962, the black wind of "three selfs and one package" blown by the Chinese Khrushchev dispersed the cooperative. The 24 households of poor peasants in the new village of four-sort mountain cried and disbanded the cooperative. Ten households of poor peasants left their homes, and the remaining poor and lower-middle peasants had to sell their land and cattle, or had to use manual labor to replace oxen, and had to become slaves to the local chiefs and headmen again. In the revolutionary criticism, people exposed many blood-stained facts, like bombs, aimed at the Chinese Khrushchev. The poor peasants angrily said: "It is the old snake, the Chinese Khrushchev, who wants to cut off our lifeline and dismantle the bridge of happiness that Chairman Mao has built for us." They also said: "The Chinese Khrushchev is still not dead, even after being burned by fire and struck by lightning. We must fight him to the end, and we will not stop fighting until we overthrow the black representatives of the local chiefs and headmen." In the fields, on the roads, and in the homes, revolutionary criticism battlefields were set up. Deep exposure, angry accusations, and powerful criticism made the members of the four-sort mountain area further see the ugly face of the Chinese Khrushchev and further raised their proletarian consciousness.

Through the revolutionary criticism, the people of various ethnic groups on Awa Mountain raised their class feelings for Chairman Mao to a new height. They said: "It is because of Chairman Mao that we Awa people have happiness, and it is because of Chairman Mao that we Dai people have everything; it is because of Chairman Mao that we have a new borderland." Every morning, whether on the high Awa Mountain or in the bamboo houses of the plains, the people of the borderlands of various ethnic groups use different languages to bless our great leader Chairman Mao with longevity!

At the beginning of last year, in response to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," the company sent a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team to a Dai village. This village, under the control of a small group of bad elements, had not grasped the revolution and production was far behind. When the propaganda team arrived at this village, the untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists were terrified and threatened to drive the propaganda team out of the village. One evening, while the propaganda team was propagating Chairman Mao's great instructions on "grasping revolution and promoting production" at a mass meeting, a small group of bad elements gathered some young people who did not understand the truth to cause trouble, trying to obstruct the spread of Mao Zedong Thought. The propaganda team stood firmly on the side of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and engaged in a head-on struggle with this small group of bad elements. The propaganda team firmly fought side by side with the poor and lower-middle peasants, grasped the revolution, promoted production, and greatly suppressed the arrogance of the class enemies and greatly boosted the morale of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The military and the people worked together, and this village saw a new situation in both revolution and production.

Over the years, the transportation company has established close revolutionary friendships with the revolutionary masses of more than ten ethnic groups, including the Dai, Awa, Lahu, and Bulang. Wherever they have been, their moving deeds of enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought are praised. The Dai people enthusiastically praise them as the Dai people's good "Along" (note); the Awa people thumbs up and praise them as the Awa people's good army; the people of various ethnic groups praise them in different languages as good propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought.

Note: Along — The Dai people praise the most welcome young man as "Along."

　　红日高照阿佤山
　　耿正先
    澜沧江水在欢唱，
    阿佤山上飞来了金凤凰；
    感谢毛主席派来的好大军，
    给边疆各族人民送来了毛泽东思想。
    这是祖国西南边疆云南省阿佤山区的各族革命群众称赞解放军某部运输连的一支山歌。
    某部骡马运输连，是某军学习毛主席著作先进单位，是连续七年荣获四好称号的连队。这个连长年累月在国境线上执勤，穿行在边疆的崇山峻岭当中，与边疆各族人民有着广泛的接触。他们走到那里，就在那里满腔热情地向人民群众宣传毛泽东思想。
    他们每过一村，每到一寨，第一件大事，就是把伟大领袖毛主席的画像，端端正正地贴在群众屋里，让红太阳永远高照阿佤山。
    千爱民，万爱民，使边疆各族人民永远忠于毛主席，就是最大的爱民。在无产阶级文化大革命中，每当毛主席发出最新指示，每当毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部发出新的战斗号召，他们一听到，就立即一村一寨地传达给群众，让毛主席的最新指示传遍祖国边疆。
    一天，他们运送一批支农物资来到阿佤山上的四排山区，听说这个山区过去曾经遭受过中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“三自一包”的严重毒害，就立即在高高的阿佤山上，摆开了革命大批判的战场。一九五八年，四排山区的各族人民响应毛主席的伟大号召，建立了合作社。一九六二年，中国赫鲁晓夫刮起的“三自一包”的黑风，把合作社吹了。四排山新寨合作社二十四户贫农哭着散了社，十户贫农背井离乡，留下的贫下中农有的卖掉了土地、耕牛，有的不得不以人工去换牛工，重新给土司、头人当奴隶。在革命大批判中，人们揭发出了许多血泪斑斑的事实，象一颗颗炸弹，投向中国赫鲁晓夫。贫农们愤怒地说：“就是中国赫鲁晓夫这条老麻蛇要砍掉我们的命根子，要拆掉毛主席为我们搭起的幸福金桥。”他们还说：“中国赫鲁晓夫现在还火烧芭蕉心不死，雷打苦竹根不烂。我们一定和他斗争到底，不把土司、头人的黑代表打倒，我们决不收兵。”田间，地头，家庭，都摆开了革命大批判的战场。深刻的揭露，愤怒的控诉，有力的批判，使四排山区的社员们进一步认清了中国赫鲁晓夫的丑恶面目，进一步提高了无产阶级觉悟。
    通过革命的大批判，阿佤山上各族人民对毛主席的阶级感情提到了一个新高度。他们说：有了毛主席，才有我们阿佤人民的幸福，才有我们傣家人的一切；有了毛主席，才有我们的新边疆。每天清晨，无论是在高高的阿佤山上，还是在坝区的竹楼里，边疆各族人民都用不同的语言，和全国亿万人民一起，祝福我们伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
    去年年初，为了响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，连里派了毛泽东思想宣传组到一个傣族村寨。这个寨子在一小撮坏人操纵下，革命没有抓起来，生产也远远掉在后面。当宣传组来到这个村寨的时候，寨子里没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子怕得要死，扬言要把宣传组赶出村寨。一天晚上，宣传组正在群众大会上宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，那一小撮坏家伙竟纠集了一些不明真相的青年人进行捣乱，妄想阻止毛泽东思想的传播。宣传组旗帜鲜明、立场坚定地站在广大贫下中农一边，和这一小撮坏人展开了针锋相对的斗争。宣传组坚定地和贫下中农战斗在一起，抓革命、促生产，大灭了阶级敌人的威风，大长了贫下中农的志气。军民齐努力，使这个寨子的革命和生产出现了一片新气象。
    几年来，运输连同边疆傣族、佤族、拉祜族、布朗族等十多个民族的革命群众建立了亲密的革命友谊，凡是他们到过的地方，都传诵着他们热情宣传毛泽东思想的动人事迹。傣族人民热烈称赞他们是傣家人的好“阿龙”（注）；阿佤人民翘着大拇指赞扬他们是阿佤人的好大军；各族人民用不同语言，称赞他们是毛泽东思想的好宣传员。
    注：阿龙——傣族人民称赞最受他们欢迎的小伙子叫“阿龙”。
