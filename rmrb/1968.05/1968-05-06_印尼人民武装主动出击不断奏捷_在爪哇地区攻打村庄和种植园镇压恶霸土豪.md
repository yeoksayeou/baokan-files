	Indonesian People's Armed Forces Launch Offensive and Achieve Successes
	Attack Villages and Plantations in Java to Suppress Local Tycoons and Landlords

	BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) — JAKARTA — Indonesian people's armed forces were active in various parts of Java in April, achieving new victories.

	According to Western news agencies and Indonesian official newspapers and news agencies, the Indonesian people's armed forces took the initiative to attack villages and plantations in many places in East Java in April, suppressing notorious landlords and local tyrants.

	It is reported that in early April, the people's armed forces raided a plantation and a village near the suburbs of Tulungagung and two rural areas near Anjuk, suppressing a group of notorious landlords and local tyrants. During the raid on the plantation, they also killed a reactionary soldier and seized some weapons. In late April, the people's armed forces again raided a village south of Malang, suppressing and arresting the local tyrants who had committed heinous crimes.

	According to a Reuters report, in the few months that the people's armed forces have been conducting guerrilla activities in East Java, with the close cooperation of the local people, they have executed more than ninety notorious landlords and local tyrants.

	According to a report by Agence France-Presse quoting the Indonesian reactionary newspaper "Armed Forces News," in late April, some farmers in the South Bandung region of West Java had organized themselves to fight for land. Farmers in this region had already launched a land struggle in 1964 and fought tenaciously against the police who came to suppress them, killing many reactionary policemen.

	Under the heavy blows of the Java people's armed forces and revolutionary people, the Indonesian fascist military regime is in a state of panic. It is reported that the head of the fascist military regime, Suharto, personally took charge on April 16, summoning the heads of four military regions in Java to secretly plot and plan to intensify the suppression of the Java people's armed forces and revolutionary people. However, the people's armed forces are growing stronger in the struggle.

　　印尼人民武装主动出击不断奏捷
　　在爪哇地区攻打村庄和种植园镇压恶霸土豪
    新华社五日讯　雅加达消息：印尼人民武装四月份在爪哇各地积极开展活动，接连取得新胜利。
    据西方通讯社和印尼官方报纸、通讯社透露，印尼人民武装四月份在东爪哇的许多地方，主动出击，攻入村庄和种植园，镇压作恶多端的恶霸地主和土豪劣绅。
    据报道，四月初人民武装曾袭击了泗水附近的南望安、土隆阿贡近郊的一个种植园和一个村庄，以及安褥附近的两个乡村，镇压了一批恶霸地主和土豪劣绅。在袭击种植园时，还击毙一个反动军人，夺取了一些武器。四月下旬，人民武装又袭击了玛琅以南的一个村庄，对那里的罪大恶极的土豪劣绅进行了镇压和逮捕。
    据路透社报道，人民武装在东爪哇开展游击活动的几个月以来，在当地人民群众的密切配合下，已处决了九十多名恶霸地主和土豪劣绅。
    另据法新社援引印尼反动报纸《武装部队报》的消息报道，四月下旬，西爪哇南安由地区的一些农民已经组织起来，进行夺取土地的斗争。这个地区的农民早在一九六四年就曾开展过夺地斗争，与前来镇压的警察进行了顽强的搏斗，打死了不少反动警察。
    在爪哇人民武装和革命人民的沉重打击下，印尼法西斯军人政权惊恐不安。据报道，法西斯军人政权头目苏哈托四月十六日亲自出马，召集爪哇四个军区的头目密谋策划加紧对爪哇人民武装和革命人民的镇压。然而，人民武装却在斗争中不断壮大。
