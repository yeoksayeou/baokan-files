More than 2,000 students in Kyoto, Japan, went on strike and demonstrated on May 24, opposing U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam, demanding the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and expressing support for the struggles of students in the United States and France.

Students from Doshisha University in Kyoto began their strike in the early morning of May 24. In the afternoon, they joined students from other universities in Kyoto to gather on campus for a rally. During the rally, students spoke out, condemning and exposing U.S. imperialism's war policies, strongly demanding that the Sato government abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and expressing fervent support for the struggles of black people in the United States against violence, as well as the student movements sweeping across Europe and the United States. They also exposed the counter-revolutionary and anti-people conspiracies of the revisionist elements within the Japanese Communist Party.

After the rally, the students took to the streets, holding high red flags and chanting slogans such as "Smash the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty!" "Down with the reactionary Sato government!" "U.S. troops out of Asia, Vietnam, and Japan!" and more.

The reactionary Sato government, terrified by the students' anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle, dispatched large numbers of armed police and plainclothes agents to brutally beat and arrest the students. The students bravely fought back against the armed police. Their struggle was supported by thousands of citizens.

    京都同志社大学的学生二十四日清晨开始罢课，当天下午他们和京都其他大学的学生一起聚集在校园内举行集会。在集会上发言的学生，谴责和揭露了美帝国主义的战争政策，强烈要求佐藤政府废除日美“安全条约”，表示热烈支持美国黑人的抗暴斗争，支持席卷欧洲和美国的学生运动。他们揭露了日共修正主义分子的反革命和反人民的阴谋活动。
    会后，学生们高举红旗，涌上街头，在主要街道上示威游行。他们高呼：“粉碎日美安全条约！”“打倒佐藤反动政府！”“美军从亚洲、越南和日本滚出去！”等口号。
    佐藤反动政府对学生们的反美爱国斗争，怕得要死，出动大批武装警察和便衣特务，疯狂地毒打和逮捕学生。学生们英勇地同武装警察进行了搏斗。他们的斗争得到数千名市民的支持。
