    新华社斯德哥尔摩一日电　瑞典公众两千五百人一日下午在首都斯德哥尔摩举行游行和集会，热烈庆祝“五一”国际劳动节。
    庆祝活动是由瑞典马列主义者共产主义联盟、“火炬社”、瑞典支援越南南方民族解放阵线委员会等团体组织的。参加庆祝活动的还有美国黑人和来自亚洲、非洲以及拉丁美洲的人士。
    参加游行的群众高举着马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的画像，高举着毛主席的画像，以及胡志明主席的画像，精神抖擞地行进在斯德哥尔摩的市中心，他们中间许多人都佩戴着毛主席像章。
    他们还高举着许多旗帜和标语牌，标语牌上写着：“毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席是我们的领袖！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“人民战争胜利万岁！”“（越南南方）民族解放阵线万岁！”“打倒美帝国主义！”“美国从越南滚出去！”
    游行的群众不断高呼伟大领袖毛主席的名字和“毛泽东万岁！”
    游行之后举行了集会。
    瑞典马列主义者共产主义联盟主席古斯塔夫森在会上发表讲话，高度赞扬毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命。他说：“在威力无比强大的毛泽东思想指引下进行的无产阶级文化大革命，保证了强大的中国永远保持鲜红的颜色”。他在分析瑞典形势时说：“我们宣布：反对垄断资产阶级，反对阶级合作，反对帝国主义。”他谴责了美帝国主义在国内外实行压迫和侵略政策。他说，伟大的七亿中国人民是越南人民和世界各国人民最可靠的后盾。他高呼：“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”
    在会上发表讲话的其他人纷纷揭露美帝国主义在越南问题上玩弄的“和谈”骗局，同时还揭露了美国统治集团镇压美国黑人和在世界上进行侵略的种种罪行。
    在会上宣读了毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，博得了与会者的热烈的掌声。
