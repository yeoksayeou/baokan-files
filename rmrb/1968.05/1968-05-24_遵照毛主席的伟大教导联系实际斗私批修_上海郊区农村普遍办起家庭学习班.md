In accordance with Chairman Mao's great teachings, linking theory with practice to criticize and repudiate revisionism, family study classes are widely established in the rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs.

The mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought is becoming more widespread and in-depth. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are full of fighting spirit and enthusiasm, grasping revolution and promoting production. Everywhere is a scene of vibrant activity.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 23rd: The new thing that emerged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—Mao Zedong Thought family study classes—is rapidly developing in the rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs, powerfully promoting the mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought to become even more widespread and in-depth.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Setting up study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." After this directive from Chairman Mao was transmitted, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs, with the strong assistance of the People's Liberation Army, sprang into action and established Mao Zedong Thought study classes everywhere. Study classes are not only set up at the county and commune levels, but also at the production brigade and production team levels, and rapidly developed to the point where commune members' families also set up study classes. Now, in many communes and production brigades, the families of poor and lower-middle peasants have all established Mao Zedong Thought study classes. From those in their seventies and eighties to children around ten years old, all are members of the study classes. The rise of Mao Zedong Thought family study classes has enabled Chairman Mao's latest directives to be quickly implemented in the families of commune members. The broad masses of commune members study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the family study classes, criticize and repudiate revisionism, and the faces of families have undergone profound changes. Now, in commune members' families, it is not a matter of who says what, but rather of acting according to Mao Zedong Thought and using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everyone's actions.

A handful of class enemies are terrified and enraged by the fact that Mao Zedong Thought family study classes are widely established among commune members. They spread malicious rumors and reactionary slogans such as "politics cannot be eaten," attempting to sabotage the Mao Zedong Thought family study classes. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, remembering Chairman Mao's teaching, "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose," have engaged in a head-on struggle with the class enemies, smashed the class enemies' sabotage activities, and consolidated the Mao Zedong Thought family study classes.

In the Mao Zedong Thought family study classes, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs extensively discuss Chairman Mao's great achievements, engage in extensive recollection and comparison, and vigorously carry out the "three loyalties" activities of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This has greatly increased the awareness of establishing Mao Zedong Thought family study classes. An old peasant woman from Huaxing Production Brigade in Caijie Commune, Chuansha County, originally thought that because of her old age and illness, she had difficulties in studying. After the brigade, production team, and family carried out activities to recall the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society, she excitedly declared that she would definitely study Chairman Mao's books and listen to Chairman Mao's words. She actively helped her son establish a family study class and insisted on studying the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's quotations every day.

In the Mao Zedong Thought family study classes, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants closely link class struggle and production struggle with reality, link the living thoughts of family members, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and make the study classes better and better. Recently, the Mao Zedong Thought family study classes in Guangming Production Brigade, Guangming Commune, Fengxian County repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest directives, extensively exposed the cover of class struggle, saw through the various tricks of the class enemies, and carried out a fierce struggle of criticism and struggle against the class enemies. The commune members in this brigade have established "family columns for criticizing and repudiating revisionism" in every household, according to the situation of the struggle and the living thoughts of family members, continuously expose and criticize personal shortcomings, fiercely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev, and raised the awareness of the proletarian class struggle and the two-line struggle.

To mobilize the broad masses to establish family study classes, the leading cadres of many production brigades and production teams have taken the lead by example, first establishing family study classes themselves, and leading the commune members to move forward together. Many units have also extensively and deeply propagated the significance of establishing family study classes to the masses, adopting methods such as cultivating models and holding on-site meetings to exchange and promote advanced experiences, making the family study classes continuously consolidated and improved.

With the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest directives and the vigorous development of Mao Zedong Thought family study classes, the rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs are everywhere vibrant with revolutionary scenes. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are full of fighting spirit and enthusiasm, grasping revolution and promoting production, determined to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    遵照毛主席的伟大教导联系实际斗私批修
    上海郊区农村普遍办起家庭学习班
    活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动更加广泛深入开展。广大贫下中农斗志昂扬，意气风发，狠抓革命，猛促生产，到处是一片热气腾腾的景象
    新华社上海二十三日电　在无产阶级文化大革命运动中涌现出来的革命新生事物——毛泽东思想家庭学习班，正在上海郊区广大农村迅猛发展，有力地促进了上海郊区农村活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动更加广泛和深入的开展。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”毛主席的这一指示传来以后，上海郊区农村广大贫下中农和革命干部，在人民解放军的大力帮助下，闻风而动，大办毛泽东思想学习班。学习班不仅县、社办，生产大队、生产队办，并迅速发展到社员家庭也办。现在，不少社队的贫下中农社员家庭都办起了毛泽东思想学习班，上至七八十岁的老人，下至十来岁的孩子，都是学习班的学员。毛泽东思想家庭学习班的兴起，使毛主席的一系列最新指示迅速落实到社员家庭。广大社员在家庭学习班里活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，家庭面貌发生了深刻的变化。现在，社员家庭里不是那个说了算，而是按照毛泽东思想办事，用毛泽东思想统帅每个人的行动。
    一小撮阶级敌人对社员家庭普遍办起毛泽东思想学习班，怕得要死，恨得要命。他们煽阴风，点鬼火，散布“政治不能当饭吃”等反动论调，妄图破坏毛泽东思想家庭学习班。广大贫下中农牢记毛主席“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对”的教导，同阶级敌人进行了针锋相对的斗争，粉碎了阶级敌人的破坏活动，巩固了毛泽东思想家庭学习班。
    上海郊区农村广大贫下中农在家庭学习班里大讲毛主席的丰功伟绩，大搞回忆对比，大力开展忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动，大大提高了办好毛泽东思想家庭学习班的自觉性。川沙县蔡路公社华星大队一位贫农老妈妈，原来认为自己年老多病，学习有困难，在大队、生产队和家庭开展了忆旧社会的苦，思新社会的甜的回忆对比活动以后，她激动地表示，一定要好好读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话。她积极帮助儿子办好家庭学习班，每天坚持学习“老三篇”和毛主席语录。
    广大贫下中农在毛泽东思想家庭学习班里密切联系阶级斗争和生产斗争实际，联系家庭成员的活思想，活学活用毛主席著作，使学习班越办越好。奉贤县光明公社光明大队毛泽东思想家庭学习班，最近反复学习毛主席的最新指示，大揭阶级斗争盖子，识破了阶级敌人的种种阴谋诡计，对阶级敌人进行了狠狠的批判斗争。这个大队的社员，家家户户办起了“家庭斗私批修专栏”，根据斗争形势和家庭成员的活思想，不断亮私斗私，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫，提高了无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    为了发动广大群众办好家庭学习班，许多生产大队、生产队的领导干部，以身作则，自己先带头办好家庭学习班，带领社员共同前进。许多单位还向群众广泛深入地宣传办家庭学习班的意义，采取培养典型，开现场会等办法，交流、推广先进经验，使家庭学习班不断巩固、提高。
    随着毛主席一系列最新指示的落实，随着毛泽东思想家庭学习班的蓬勃发展，上海郊区农村到处是一片热气腾腾的革命景象。广大贫下中农斗志昂扬，意气风发，狠抓革命，猛促生产，决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
