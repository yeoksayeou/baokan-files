Oppose U.S. Imperialism's Aggression Against Vietnam, B-52 Aircraft Must Withdraw
Okinawan People Hold Anti-U.S. Rally and Demonstration in Front of U.S. Air Base
U.S. Military Authorities Panicked, Deploy Troops and Aircraft for Suppression
Demonstrators Fearlessly Engage in Brave Struggle

	NEW DELHI, May 7 (Xinhua) — On May 2, the people of Okinawa held a rally and demonstration in front of the U.S. Kadena Air Base to oppose U.S. imperialism's escalation of the war in Vietnam. They also engaged in a fierce struggle with the invading U.S. forces that came to suppress them.

	That afternoon, workers, youth, and students from Okinawa, carrying red flags and the flags of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, sang the battle song "Return Okinawa" and surged towards the gate of the U.S. Kadena Air Base in Okinawa to demonstrate. They opposed U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, demanded the withdrawal of B-52 aircraft from Okinawa, and requested a meeting with the U.S. base commander to protest directly. The terrified U.S. military authorities hastily deployed fully armed troops and jet aircraft to suppress and threaten the demonstrators. The atrocities of the U.S. military authorities further enraged the demonstrators. They fearlessly fought back against the ruthless American soldiers, shouting slogans such as "Oppose U.S. aggression against Vietnam!" and "Withdraw U.S. B-52 aircraft!" Some American soldiers had their helmets knocked off and scattered on the ground.

	Under the blows of the demonstrators, the U.S. military authorities were in a state of disarray. They then mobilized Japanese armed police to suppress the demonstrators. However, the demonstrators continued to march and hold rallies with great courage, expressing strong protests against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

	The U.S. military authorities in Okinawa have always used Japanese police to suppress people's struggles. This time, they brazenly deployed fully armed U.S. troops to suppress the demonstrators, further exposing the ferocious face of U.S. imperialism and its paper tiger's weak essence.

　　反对美帝侵略越南　B—52型飞机必须撤走
　　冲绳人民在美空军基地前举行反美集会示威
　　美军当局慌忙出动军队和飞机进行镇压　示威群众不畏强暴展开英勇斗争
    新华社东京电　冲绳人民二日在嘉手纳美国空军基地前面举行反对美帝扩大侵越战争的集会和示威游行，并且同前来镇压他们的美国侵略军展开了英勇的搏斗。
    这天下午，冲绳的工人、青年和学生举着红旗和越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜，高唱《还我冲绳》战歌，涌向冲绳嘉手纳美国空军基地门前进行示威，反对美帝国主义侵略越南，要求从冲绳撤走B—52型飞机，要求会见美国基地司令以便当面向他提出抗议。被示威群众吓破了胆的美军当局，慌忙出动全副武装的军队和喷气式飞机来镇压和威胁示威群众。美军当局的暴行，激起了示威群众的更强烈的愤怒。他们不畏强暴，同穷凶极恶的美国士兵进行了激烈的搏斗，并且不断高呼“反对美国侵略越南！”“撤走美国B—52型飞机！”等口号。有的美国士兵的钢盔被示威群众打掉在地，到处乱滚。
    在示威群众的打击下，美军当局十分狼狈，又调动日本武装警察前来镇压示威群众。但示威群众仍以大无畏的精神，继续游行和举行集会，对美日反动派表示强烈抗议。
    驻冲绳美军当局过去一直是驱使日本警察镇压人民斗争，这次它悍然直接出动全副武装的美军镇压示威群众，这就更加暴露了美帝国主义的凶恶面目及其纸老虎的虚弱本质。
