The Secretariat of the French Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) recently published a statement in *Le Nouvel Humanité* expressing support for the student movement that is currently rising in France.

The statement said: The rapid development of the students' brave struggle has won the admiration of the French people. Especially on the night of May 10 to 11, 1968, Paris students, together with many workers, bravely and resolutely fought back against the brutal repression of reactionary forces.

Marxist-Leninists united within the French Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) believe in the youth and participate in all revolutionary actions of the youth.

The students' struggle is completely just. It strikes at the decadent bourgeois society and is a struggle against monopoly capital and fascism.

The recent development of the entire situation clearly shows that the theory of the "peaceful" or "parliamentary" road advocated by the revisionist leaders of the French Communist Party is sheer deception.

The brutal repression carried out by the monopoly capitalist authorities proves that the bourgeoisie always uses violence first, so it is only natural to counter it with revolutionary violence.

The students are justified in rebelling and defending themselves.

The government must bear full responsibility for the situation.

If the working class, which leads our laboring masses, does not immediately rise up to resist this policy, the fascist measures being implemented will develop into a fascist regime, which will then carry out a long-term reign of terror and violence, even disregarding its own bourgeois legal system. In the current student movement, the decisive factor is the revolutionary movement of the masses.

Therefore, the French Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) serves the youth because the youth aspire to transform our society, abandon capitalism, and build socialism.

Undoubtedly, especially because of the betrayal of the revisionists, a part of the working class—the revolutionary class that has always been in the lead—cannot function. However, today, the students' struggle is a great contribution to the entire revolutionary struggle of the French people because it can arouse the revolutionary consciousness of our laboring people. The French Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) firmly supports the various demands put forward by the students.

The French Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) calls on all students to unite at the grassroots level and in action, as they have already actively achieved in the week of intense struggle. The French Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) exposes the various conspiracies that have already been implemented and will be even more intensified in the coming days, whose purpose is to distort the essence of the students' struggle, to the benefit of the old parties in the hands of bourgeois politicians, and to the benefit of those who support these old parties. Therefore, the French Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) calls on all students to be vigilant.

Although the French people still have to undergo a difficult and protracted struggle, they will inevitably sweep away the capitalist system.

    法共（马列）书记处发表声明坚决支持法国学生的正义斗争
    法国学生造反有理自卫有理
    法修头目鼓吹的“和平”道路和“议会”道路纯属欺人之谈
    新华社十六日讯　巴黎消息：法国马克思列宁主义共产党中央委员会书记处最近在《新人道报》上发表声明，表示支持正在法国兴起的学生运动。
    声明说：学生英勇斗争的迅猛发展，博得了法国人民的赞扬。特别是在一九六八年五月十日深夜至十一日凌晨，巴黎学生同很多工人相结合，勇敢而坚决地反击了反动势力的残暴镇压。
    团结在法国共产党（马克思列宁主义）内的马克思列宁主义者，相信青年并且参加青年的一切革命行动。
    学生的斗争是完全正义的，它冲击了资产阶级的腐朽社会，这是一场反对垄断资本和反法西斯的斗争。
    最近的整个事态发展清楚地表明了，“法共”修正主义头目所鼓吹的那套“和平”道路或“议会”道路的理论纯属欺人之谈。
    垄断资本当局所进行的残暴镇压证明，资产阶级总是首先使用暴力，因此，用革命的暴力来反击它，是天经地义的事情。
    学生造反有理，自卫有理。
    政府必须对局势承担全部责任。
    如果以工人阶级为首的我国劳动群众不立即奋起抗击这种政策，正在推行的法西斯化措施就会发展到法西斯政权，这个法西斯政权就将实行长久的恐怖暴力统治，甚至连它的资产阶级法制都不顾了。在当前的学生运动中，决定的因素是群众的革命运动。
    因此，法国共产党（马克思列宁主义）为青年服务，因为青年渴望改造我们的社会，摒弃资本主义，要建立社会主义。
    无疑，特别是因为修正主义者的背叛而仍然使一部分工人阶级——自始至终居领导地位的革命阶级——不能起作用，所以形势尚未成熟。但是，在今天，学生的斗争是对法国人民的整个革命斗争的巨大贡献，因为它能激发我国劳动人民的革命觉悟。法国共产党（马克思列宁主义）坚决支持学生所提出的各项要求。
    法国共产党（马克思列宁主义）号召全体学生在基层、在行动中团结起来，就象他们在激烈斗争的一周中所已经积极实现的那样。法国共产党（马克思列宁主义）揭露已经在施展的和在今后几天中必将变本加厉地施展的各种阴谋，这种阴谋的目的在于歪曲学生斗争的实质问题，以利于掌握在资产阶级政客手中的旧政党，以利于支持这些旧政党的那些人。因此，法国共产党（马克思列宁主义）号召全体学生提高警惕。
    法国人民虽然还得进行艰巨和漫长的斗争，但必将扫除资本主义制度。（附图片）
