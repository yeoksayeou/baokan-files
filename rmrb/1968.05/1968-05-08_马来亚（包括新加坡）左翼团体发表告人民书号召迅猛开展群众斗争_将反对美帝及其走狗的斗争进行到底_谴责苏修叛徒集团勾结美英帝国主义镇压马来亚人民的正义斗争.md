Leftist groups in Malaya (including Singapore) have recently issued an open letter to the people, calling on the Malayan working class and broad masses of the people to vigorously launch mass struggles, carry on the fight against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to the end, and strive for a truly independent, united, and democratic Malaya.

The open letter published in the Malayan newspaper *Frontline News* on April 28 states that U.S. and British imperialism, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, and all reactionaries are colluding with each other. In order to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the working class and the toiling masses, they have become increasingly fascist, increasingly brutal, cunning, and treacherous. They use force to suppress the just struggles of the people, fabricate the pseudo-"Malaysia" and pseudo-"Republic of Singapore," and have committed heinous crimes against the Malayan people, with their hands stained with the blood of the people.

The open letter says: Where there is oppression, there is resistance. In Malaya, from the countryside to the cities, from the land to the sea, revolutionary workers and the broad masses of the people have launched a magnificent struggle against oppression, fully demonstrating their anti-imperialist resolve, greatly boosting the morale of the people, and greatly dampening the arrogance of the enemy.

The open letter states that the struggle of the Malayan working class has closely united with the anti-imperialist struggle of the broad masses of the people, forming a powerful torrent that powerfully impacts the reactionary rule of U.S. and British imperialism and their lackeys.

The open letter states that the great teacher of the revolutionary people of the contemporary world, Chairman Mao, says: "What is the real iron wall? It is the masses, the tens of millions of people who truly and sincerely support the revolution. This is the real iron wall, which no force can break, absolutely no force can break. The counter-revolution cannot break us, but we will break the counter-revolution."

The open letter points out: To strive for the national liberation of the Malayan people, we must establish a powerful united front led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, and uniting all revolutionary people, directing the spearhead against the common enemy—U.S. and British imperialism and their lackey puppet regime of Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew.

The open letter points out that today, the overall international situation is excellent. The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the great victory of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation, the new upsurge in the struggle of black people in the United States against violence, the serious economic crisis in the capitalist world, and the flourishing anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles around the world, all greatly inspire and support the national liberation struggle of the Malayan people. The burial of imperialism and capitalism by the people of the world is not far off.

The open letter points out that no matter how desperately U.S. and British imperialism, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, and the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet clique struggle, attempting to extinguish the revolutionary struggle of the Malayan people, they cannot save themselves from their inevitable doom.

　　马来亚（包括新加坡）左翼团体发表告人民书号召迅猛开展群众斗争
　　将反对美帝及其走狗的斗争进行到底
　　谴责苏修叛徒集团勾结美英帝国主义镇压马来亚人民的正义斗争
    新华社七日讯　新加坡消息：马来亚（包括新加坡）左翼团体最近发表告人民书，号召马来亚工人阶级和广大人民群众迅猛地开展群众斗争，把反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争进行到底，争取实现一个真正独立、统一、民主的马来亚。
    在新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《阵线报》四月二十八日刊登的这篇告人民书指出，美英帝国主义、苏修叛徒集团以及一切反动派正在互相勾结在一起。他们为了扑灭工人阶级和劳苦大众的革命烈火，已经日益法西斯化，日益凶残、狡猾和阴险。他们用武力镇压人民大众的正义斗争，他们炮制伪“马来西亚”和伪“新加坡共和国”，对马来亚人民犯下了滔天罪行，他们的手上沾满了人民的鲜血。
    告人民书说：哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗。在马来亚，从乡村到城市，从陆地到海上，革命工人、广大人民群众展开了轰轰烈烈的反迫害斗争，充分表现了他们的反帝决心，大长了人民的志气，大灭了敌人的威风。
    告人民书说，马来亚工人阶级的斗争已经和广大人民群众的反帝斗争紧紧地结合在一起，形成一股强大的洪流，有力地冲击着美英帝国主义及其走狗的反动统治。
    告人民书说，当代世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席说：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。”
    告人民书指出：为了争取马来亚人民的民族解放，就要建立一个以工人阶级为领导、工农联盟为基础，联合一切革命人民的强大的统一战线，把矛头对准共同的敌人——美英帝国主义及其走狗拉赫曼—李光耀傀儡政权。
    告人民书指出，今天，整个国际形势一片大好，中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，美国黑人抗暴斗争的新高涨，资本主义世界严重的经济危机，以及世界各地反帝反殖斗争的蓬勃发展，都大大地鼓舞和支援了马来亚人民的民族解放斗争。全世界人民埋葬帝国主义、资本主义已经为期不远了。
    告人民书指出，不管美英帝国主义、苏修叛徒集团和拉赫曼—李光耀傀儡集团如何进行疯狂挣扎，妄图扑灭马来亚人民的革命斗争，都不能挽救他们必然灭亡的命运。
