On the second anniversary of the issuance of the "Notification" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, dated May 16, 1966, which was personally drafted by our great leader Chairman Mao, foreign friends in Beijing expressed their love and admiration for Chairman Mao to our reporters. They praised the "Notification" as a brilliant document of Marxism-Leninism that marks an epoch, enthusiastically hailed the great victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, and enthusiastically hailed the fact that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has greatly inspired and promoted the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries.

Japanese friends Yagaki Michinori and Funatsu Kazuko said in their remarks that the "Notification" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, dated May 16, 1966, which was personally drafted by Chairman Mao, is the battle cry for the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. They said that the first socialist country, the Soviet Union, had its leadership usurped by modern revisionists, resulting in a full-scale restoration of capitalism, which posed new questions for the international communist movement: Is there class struggle throughout the entire historical period of socialism? Is the focus of class struggle under socialist conditions the struggle between the proletariat to consolidate its power and the bourgeoisie to overthrow proletarian dictatorship? Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, should the revolution continue? Whose revolution? How to revolution? The great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, summarized the historical experience of the Chinese revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat internationally, and wisely proposed the theory, line, policy, and principles for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. He personally initiated and led the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, correctly solving the urgent problems facing the international communist movement in both theory and practice, and pointing the way for all Marxist-Leninists in the world to carry the proletarian revolution through to the end. The great practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China over the past two years has proven that the theory proposed by Chairman Mao is the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism.

Japanese friends said that Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great teacher of the proletariat worldwide. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times, the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards total collapse and socialism is advancing towards world victory, and a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism and revisionism. The great victories achieved in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao have greatly strengthened the world's revolutionary base—socialist China—and had a tremendous impact on the world revolution.

Japanese friends said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has enabled the Japanese people to further recognize that Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology of the Japanese revolutionary struggle and to further recognize that the Miyamoto revisionist clique is the enemy of the proletariat. The revolutionary leftist forces in Japan have already developed, and in their struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, the Soviet revisionists, and the Miyamoto clique, they have begun to realize that to achieve victory in the Japanese revolution, it is necessary to establish a unified, strong Communist Party guided by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, unite the broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and all patriotic forces in Japan, combine Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the specific conditions of Japan, arm themselves with Chairman Mao's great teaching that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," and achieve a thorough victory in the Japanese revolution. Long live Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the Japanese revolution!

Thai friend Nida said that the "Notification" is a brilliant document of Marxism-Leninism with great historical significance, guiding the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China from victory to victory.

Nida said that Chairman Mao has developed Marxism-Leninism and brilliantly solved the theoretical, line, policy, and principles of continuing the proletarian revolution and preventing capitalist restoration under socialist conditions, which is a new milestone in the history of the development of Marxism-Leninism. Chairman Mao has shown the way to communism for the revolutionary peoples of the world in both theory and practice.

She said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao is a great encouragement and aid to the peoples who are waging revolutionary struggles, pointing out the direction and path to victory for them. It tells the proletariat of various countries that after seizing power, they must carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to prevent capitalist restoration and ensure that the socialist red regime will never change color. For the revolutionary peoples of countries whose power has been usurped by revisionists, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will surely inspire them to seize power back from the revisionists.

Nida said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has had a profound impact on the revolutionary struggle of the Thai people. The Thai people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, unconditionally support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has ignited the revolutionary enthusiasm of the Thai people, and they will channel this enthusiasm into their own revolutionary struggle. The Communist Party of Thailand, in its proclamation on its 25th anniversary, called on all revolutionary people nationwide to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, strive to improve their theoretical level of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, combine the highest level of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought—with the revolutionary practice of Thailand; called on the members of the Communist Party of Thailand to reform their worldview with Mao Zedong Thought, promote the revolutionization of thought, and ensure that the party remains unchanging, the party members become red party members, and the soldiers become red soldiers. Nida said that the revolutionary people of Thailand are actively responding to the call of the Communist Party of Thailand, studying the works of Chairman Mao, and following Chairman Mao's teaching of "rebellion is justified" against the reactionaries, firmly grasping the guns in their hands, and bravely fighting to defeat American imperialism and its lackey, the Thanom-Praphat reactionary clique.

Greek friend Yamanakis said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has extremely great significance for the Chinese revolution and the international communist movement. It ensures that the socialist red regime in China will never change color, and the revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party with Chairman Mao at its helm will surely achieve victory.

Yamanakis said that now people all over the world place their hopes in China because China has the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao. He pointed out that to achieve victory in the revolution, one must, like the Chinese Communist Party, adhere to the principles of Marxism-Leninism. He said that Greece must establish a genuine party that adheres to the principles of Marxism-Leninism to lead the Greek revolutionary struggle to victory.

Yamanakis, talking about the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, said that what true communists welcome is what revisionism fears. No matter how the propaganda machines of revisionism slander and defame China, they cannot deceive true Marxist-Leninists. People know that their opposition to China means that China is doing well. Yamanakis pointed out that what revisionism fears is essentially the fear of the communist road pointed out by Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

Colombian friend Leonel Cruz said that the "Notification" proposed the theory, line, policy, and principles for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, solving the problem of how to consolidate the proletarian dictatorship, and pointing out the effective methods to oppose revisionism and seize back the leadership usurped by revisionists. This is Chairman Mao's creative development of Marxism-Leninism.

He said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao is a great revolutionary movement under the dictatorship of the proletariat, an unprecedented new thing. This revolution is a struggle of the proletariat and the broad masses of the people against capitalist restoration, a struggle to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and it relates to the fate of the Chinese revolution and the future of the world revolution and the revolution in Latin America. Considering the serious lessons of the capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union, the revolutionary peoples of the world have an even greater understanding of the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and cheer for it.

Cruz said that China is a strong base for the revolutionary peoples of the world to oppose imperialism. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has further promoted the spread of Mao Zedong Thought in Latin America, further awakened the revolutionary peoples of Latin America, and promoted the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Latin America and the peoples of the world.

African friend Suleiman Habib said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a great revolutionary movement related to the fate of China and the future of the world. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has raised the awareness of the African peoples who are fighting to smash the shackles of imperialism and colonialism, enabling the revolutionary peoples of Africa to see through the counter-revolutionary nature of revisionism, and pointing out the correct path for the anti-imperialist, anti-revisionist struggle of the African peoples against old and new colonialism.

Regarding the attacks and slanders by imperialism, revisionism, and colonialists against the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, Suleiman Habib said that these reactionary propaganda are all lies. I have seen with my own eyes in China that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have been fully mobilized, and they are fighting to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary spirit shown by the Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the best refutation of these reactionary propaganda.

Suleiman Habib finally said that Mao Zedong Thought is an invincible ideological weapon. We must strive to study Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely fight against imperialism, revisionism, and old and new colonialism.

    在京各国朋友热烈称颂中共中央《通知》是马列主义的划时代文献
    毛主席指出了把无产阶级革命进行到底的光辉道路
    中国文化大革命极大鼓舞和促进各国人民革命斗争
    新华社十六日讯　我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》发表两周年的时候，在北京的各国朋友怀着对毛主席热爱和敬仰的感情，向本社记者发表谈话，热烈称颂《通知》是马克思列宁主义的划时代的光辉文献，热烈欢呼毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大胜利，热烈欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命极大地鼓舞和促进了各国人民的革命斗争。
    日本朋友仰木道之、船津和子在谈话中，称颂毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》，是史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命的进军号。他们说，第一个社会主义国家苏联，被现代修正主义者篡夺了领导权，出现了资本主义的全面复辟，这就向国际共产主义运动提出了一些新问题，即：社会主义社会整个历史阶段里有没有阶级斗争？社会主义条件下阶级斗争的焦点是不是无产阶级要巩固政权、资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政的斗争？无产阶级专政条件下还要不要继续进行革命？革谁的命？怎样革命？无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席总结了中国革命和国际无产阶级专政的历史经验，英明地提出了在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，并且亲自发动和领导了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，从理论上和实践上正确解决了国际共产主义运动所面临的迫切需要解决的问题，为全世界马克思列宁主义者指出了把无产阶级革命进行到底的光明道路。两年来的中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践，证明毛主席所提出的理论是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理。
    日本朋友说，毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是世界无产阶级的伟大导师。毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义，是反帝、反修的强大的思想武器。毛主席亲自发动和领导的人类历史上空前未有的无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大胜利，大大加强了世界的革命基地——社会主义中国，对世界革命产生了巨大影响。
    日本朋友说，中国无产阶级文化大革命，使日本人民进一步认识到毛泽东思想是日本革命斗争的指导思想，进一步认识到宫本修正主义集团是无产阶级的敌人。日本的革命左派力量已经发展起来，他们在反对美日反动派、苏修和宫本集团的斗争中开始认识到，为了日本革命的胜利，必须建立一个以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为指导的、统一的、坚强的共产党，在共产党的领导下，团结日本广大工人、农民、革命知识分子，以及一切爱国力量，把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同日本具体情况相结合，用毛主席的“枪杆子里面出政权”的伟大教导武装自己，夺取日本革命的彻底胜利。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想必胜！日本革命必胜！
    泰国朋友妮达说，《通知》是具有伟大历史意义的光辉的马克思列宁主义文献，它指导了史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命从胜利走向胜利。
    妮达说，毛主席发展了马克思列宁主义，天才地解决了在社会主义条件下无产阶级继续进行革命和防止资本主义复辟的理论、路线、方针和政策问题，这是马克思列宁主义发展史上的一个新的里程碑。毛主席在理论和实践上给世界革命人民指明了通往共产主义的光辉道路。
    她说，伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，对正在进行革命斗争的人民是巨大的鼓舞和援助，给他们指明了前进的方向和胜利的道路。它向各国无产阶级指出，在取得政权以后，还必须进行无产阶级文化大革命，才能防止资本主义复辟，永保社会主义江山不变颜色。对于已被修正主义分子篡夺了政权的国家的革命人民，中国的无产阶级文化大革命必将鼓舞他们，把政权从修正主义分子手中夺回来。
    妮达说，中国的无产阶级文化大革命已对泰国人民的革命斗争，产生了深远的影响。泰国共产党领导下的泰国人民，无条件地支持中国的无产阶级文化大革命。中国无产阶级文化大革命激发了泰国人民的革命热情，他们定把这种热情用到自己的革命斗争中去。泰国共产党在她成立二十五周年的文告中，号召全国革命人民更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，努力提高马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想理论水平，把当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想同泰国革命实践相结合；号召泰国共产党员用毛泽东思想改造世界观，促进思想革命化，保证党成为永不变色的党，党员成为红色党员，战士成为红色战士。妮达说，泰国革命人民积极响应泰国共产党的号召，努力学习毛主席著作，正遵照毛主席“对反动派造反有理”的教导，紧握手中枪，为打败美帝国主义及其走狗他侬—巴博反动集团而进行英勇斗争。
    希腊朋友亚曼基斯说，中国无产阶级文化大革命，对中国革命和国际共产主义运动有着极其巨大的意义。它保证了中国的社会主义的红色政权永远不会改变颜色，以毛主席为首的中国共产党领导的革命一定能取得胜利。
    亚曼基斯说，现在全世界人民都把希望寄托在中国，因为中国有伟大领袖毛主席的领导。他指出，要取得革命的胜利，就要象中国共产党那样，坚持马克思列宁主义原则。他说，希腊必须建立一个真正坚持马克思列宁主义原则的党，才能领导希腊的革命斗争取得胜利。
    亚曼基斯谈到中国无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势时说，真正共产党员所欢迎的，就是修正主义所害怕的。不管修正主义的宣传工具怎样对中国进行诬蔑和诽谤，但是它是骗不了真正马克思列宁主义者的。人们知道，他们反对中国，就说明中国干得好。亚曼基斯指出，修正主义所害怕的，实质上就是害怕毛主席指出的共产主义道路，害怕毛泽东思想。
    哥伦比亚朋友莱昂波多·克鲁斯说，《通知》提出了无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，解决了如何巩固无产阶级政权的问题，指出了反对修正主义、夺回被修正主义分子篡夺的领导权的有效方法。这是毛主席对马克思列宁主义的创造性的发展。
    他说，毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，是无产阶级专政条件下进行的一次伟大的革命运动，是史无前例的新事物。这场革命是无产阶级和广大人民群众反对资本主义复辟的斗争，是巩固无产阶级专政的斗争，它关系到中国革命的命运，也关系到世界革命和拉丁美洲的革命前途。考虑到苏联资本主义复辟的严重教训，世界革命人民就更加认识到中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，并为它发出欢呼。
    克鲁斯说，中国是世界革命人民反对帝国主义的强大根据地。中国无产阶级文化大革命，使毛泽东思想在拉丁美洲进一步得到广泛传播，进一步促进了拉丁美洲革命人民的觉醒，促进了拉丁美洲人民的革命斗争和世界人民的革命斗争。
    非洲朋友苏莱曼·哈比卜说，中国无产阶级文化大革命，是关系到中国的命运和世界前途的一场伟大革命运动。中国无产阶级文化大革命，提高了正在为砸碎帝国主义、殖民主义枷锁而进行斗争的非洲人民的觉悟，使非洲革命人民认清了修正主义的反革命本质，给非洲人民的反帝、反修、反对新老殖民主义的斗争指出了正确的道路。
    对于帝国主义、修正主义和殖民主义者对中国无产阶级文化大革命的攻击和诬蔑，苏莱曼·哈比卜说，这些反动宣传完全是一派谎言。我在中国亲眼看到，在毛主席领导下，中国人民充分发动起来，他们为保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而进行斗争。中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中所表现出来的革命精神，就是对这些反动宣传的最好的回击。
    苏莱曼·哈比卜最后说，毛泽东思想是威力无比的思想武器，我们要努力学习毛泽东思想，坚决同帝国主义、修正主义、新老殖民主义作斗争。
