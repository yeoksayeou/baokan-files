Hong Kong patriots have been holding meetings and issuing statements in recent days to strongly protest the British Hong Kong authorities' unreasonable harassment of the shipment of 5,000 tons of rice to Hong Kong, which was allocated by the Guangdong Provincial Committee for Supporting Hong Kong and Kowloon Patriots in Their Anti-British and Anti-Violence Struggle to comfort Hong Kong patriots.

The Hong Kong and Kowloon Patriots' Committee Against British Oppression and the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions have each issued statements, enthusiastically supporting the spokesperson of the Guangdong Provincial Committee for Supporting Hong Kong, who spoke on May 4. These statements express heartfelt gratitude to Chairman Mao and the people of the entire country for their warm concern for the Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots.

The statements say: The reason why the comfort rice has not yet been shipped to Hong Kong is entirely due to the unreasonable harassment and obstruction by the British Hong Kong authorities, which has caused great indignation among the workers and patriots of the entire Hong Kong. The British Hong Kong authorities, while having to admit verbally that this batch of comfort rice is non-commercial, insist on having it handled by a "registered rice merchant" designated by the British Hong Kong authorities, attempting to turn this batch of rice into commercial rice, thereby erasing its political significance. The British Hong Kong authorities' extremely unreasonable attitude can only show that they intend to continue to be enemies of the Hong Kong patriots and the Chinese people.

The statements sternly warn the British Hong Kong authorities: They must immediately stop persecuting Hong Kong patriots and make proper arrangements for this batch of comfort rice to enter Hong Kong. If they persist in their stubbornness, they will not have a good outcome.

Workers, students, hawkers, and patriots from various industries in Hong Kong and Kowloon have been holding meetings, angrily denouncing the British Hong Kong authorities' vicious actions in unreasonably harassing the shipment of comfort rice from the motherland to Hong Kong. Striking workers, unemployed and semi-unemployed workers, and their families have been going to the British Hong Kong "Assistant Colonial Secretary's Office" and "Trade Department" in batches over the past few days, expressing strong protests and demanding that the British Hong Kong authorities immediately arrange for the comfort rice from the motherland to be shipped into Hong Kong.

Workers from various industries have resolutely stated that they have made all the preparations for distributing the comfort rice. They eagerly await the comfort rice from the motherland to arrive in Hong Kong day and night and will absolutely not allow the British Hong Kong authorities to continue to harass and obstruct it.

    强烈抗议港英当局刁难我慰问米运港
    新华社香港十日电　香港爱国同胞连日来纷纷举行集会和发表声明，强烈抗议港英当局无理刁难广东省人民支援港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争委员会为慰问香港爱国同胞而拨发的五千吨大米运往香港。
    港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会和港九工会联合会分别发表声明，热烈拥护广东省人民支港委员会发言人四日发表的谈话。这些声明对广东省人民支港委员会在今年一月决定拨发五千吨大米慰问港九爱国同胞，表示最衷心地感谢伟大领袖毛主席和全国人民对港九爱国同胞的亲切关怀。
    声明说：慰问大米所以迟迟未能运港，完全是由于港英当局的无理刁难和阻挠，全港工人和爱国同胞表示极大的愤慨。港英当局口头上不得不承认这批慰问米是非商业性的，但又硬要由港英当局指定的“注册米商”办理进口手续，妄图把这批米变为商业米，借以抹煞它的政治意义。港英当局这种极端无理的态度，只能表明它蓄意继续与香港爱国同胞和中国人民为敌。
    声明严正警告港英当局：必须立即停止迫害香港爱国同胞，对这批慰问米来港从速作出妥善安排，如果顽固到底，决不会有好下场。
    港九各业工人、学生、小贩和爱国同胞纷纷举行集会，愤怒谴责港英当局无理刁难祖国慰问米来港的恶劣行径。罢工工人、失业和半失业工人以及他们的家属连日来怀着满腔怒火，分批到港英“辅政司署”和“工商处”，提出强烈抗议，并责令港英当局立即安排祖国慰问米运入香港。
    各业工人坚决表示，我们已做好一切分发慰问米的准备工作，我们日夜盼望祖国慰问米早日运来香港，绝对不容许港英当局继续刁难和阻挠。
