In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the medical department of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, broke through the old frameworks of bourgeois academic "authorities," and with a spirit of daring to think and act, successfully removed a 90-jin (approximately 112.5-pound) tumor from a female patient.

The patient, Zhang Qiuju, is a 37-year-old female member of the commune from Langcun Production Brigade, Gaocun People's Commune, Mancheng County, Hebei Province. In the summer of 1964, she discovered a small lump in her abdomen that caused some pain. The lump grew larger over time, her abdomen swelled, and her weight increased to nearly 200 jin (approximately 250 pounds). Her lungs were compressed by the tumor, making it difficult for her to breathe. She could not move, lie flat, or bend over, spending entire days and nights kneeling or lying awkwardly on her bed, with calluses forming on her knees. She could not take care of herself and was in great mental anguish.

When the medical department of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army first received this patient, they were concerned that the department's conditions were poor and lacked experience, fearing that they might not be able to treat the disease properly, causing greater suffering for the patient's family. What should they do? The entire department studied Mao Zedong's teachings on "wholeheartedly serving the people" and unanimously agreed that soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, could not ignore the people's sufferings and must not abandon class sisters in their time of need.

Zhang Qiuju was admitted to the hospital. The medical staff, while caring for her, helped her study Chairman Mao's works every day, boosting her courage to overcome the disease. The medical department also organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class for all staff, engaging in self-criticism and repudiating revisionism, breaking through the old frameworks of bourgeois academic "authorities," and establishing the confidence to dare to struggle and dare to win.

Before the operation, the medical staff followed Chairman Mao's teachings: "Do not fight a battle without preparation, do not fight a battle without confidence," and "Strategically, we must despise all enemies; tactically, we must take all enemies seriously." They conducted thorough examinations of Zhang Qiuju, from local to full-body, from general to special examinations, covering over 30 items, fully grasping firsthand materials and understanding the patient's entire condition. On this basis, they sent a study group to a hospital that had previously treated Zhang Qiuju to review her medical records, inquire about her condition, and seek treatment opinions. They also learned from a certain unit about the valuable experience of using Mao Zedong Thought to guide medical work. The medical staff combined a great revolutionary spirit with a serious scientific attitude, observing the patient's condition for over a month, conducting clinical examinations, and repeatedly researching to reach a new conclusion: Zhang Qiuju had a benign tumor.

To win this battle of removing the large tumor, the entire medical department repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "We are doing what our predecessors have never done, an extremely glorious and great cause. Our goal must be achieved. Our goal will definitely be achieved." They said with unwavering confidence: As long as we use Mao Zedong Thought to command the battle, this hard battle of removing the large tumor will definitely be won. They imagined all possible problems that might arise during the operation, summarizing them into ten "what ifs" for multiple discussions, proposing over 120 solutions. On this basis, they formulated a relatively ideal surgical plan and held a life-saving oath-taking rally, with all medical staff pledging to Chairman Mao.

The news of the operation to remove Zhang Qiuju's large tumor spread to the barracks, and the soldiers were considering how to contribute their strength to this operation. The tumor was too large, and ordinary surgical instruments were not suitable, so brother units actively cooperated, ensuring that personnel, materials, and blood were available, firmly supporting the medical department's revolutionary action to rescue the critically ill class sister. Many soldiers from various companies also solemnly pledged: To dedicate their hearts to Chairman Mao and donate blood to their class sister.

On March 23, the day of the operation, the commanding officers personally visited the operating room, providing great support to the medical staff in completing this surgical task. The operation began, and the medical staff, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, worked tirelessly inside and outside the room. Many people fought for an entire day without eating or drinking. During the operation, the medical staff followed Chairman Mao's teachings: "We need a passionate yet calm mood, a tense yet orderly work ethic," overcoming one difficulty after another. After 13 hours of intense work, they finally completely removed a rare 90-jin (approximately 112.5-pound) tumor from the patient's body.

Zhang Qiuju, saved from the brink of death, was filled with boundless gratitude towards the great leader Chairman Mao. When she regained consciousness after the operation and felt her abdomen, which had just shrunk, she immediately shed tears of joy and exclaimed with difficulty: Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao! It is you, Chairman Mao, who saved my life!

Zhang Qiuju's condition after the operation was good, and her health improved day by day. The incision on her body, from the left side of her back to the right side of her abdomen, was 95 centimeters long (including an auxiliary incision), but it healed quickly, just like a routine appendectomy. Six days after the operation, the stitches were removed, and by the eighth day, she could walk on her own.

The successful removal of this rare large tumor by the medical department of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region of the People's Liberation Army once again demonstrated the immense power of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Now, this event has become a new topic of discussion among the local people. The broad masses of the people unanimously praised: This is a miracle created by the comrades of the People's Liberation Army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, a fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士创造奇迹
    北京部队某部卫生科发扬敢想敢干革命精神  从一位女病人腹中成功地切除九十斤大肿瘤
    新华社石家庄二十一日电　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，人民解放军北京部队某部卫生科，以毛泽东思想为武器，大破资产阶级学术“权威”的旧框框，发扬敢想敢干的革命精神，从一位女病人腹中成功地切除了一个重达九十斤的肿瘤。
    这位病人叫张秋菊，是河北省满城县郭村公社郎村大队的女社员，今年三十七岁。一九六四年夏天，她发觉腹内有个小包块，有些疼痛。后来，这个包块不断生长，腹部增大，体重逐渐增加到一百九十多斤。她的肺部因受肿瘤挤压，呼吸很困难。她不能行动，不能平躺，不能弯腰，整天整夜只能在炕上跪着或歪躺着，膝盖磨起了一层老茧。她自己不能料理生活，精神上感到很痛苦。
    人民解放军某部卫生科刚接待这位病人的时候，耽心卫生科的条件差，没有经验，治不好病会给患者家庭带来更大的痛苦。怎么办？全科人员认真学习了毛主席关于“全心全意地为人民服务”的伟大教导，一致认为，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民解放军战士，绝不能看着群众的疾苦不管，更不能对阶级姐妹见死不救。
    张秋菊住院了。卫生员在对她进行护理的过程中，天天帮助她学习毛主席著作，提高她战胜疾病的勇气。卫生科还开办了由各科人员参加的毛泽东思想学习班，斗私批修，大破资产阶级学术“权威”的旧框框，树立了敢于斗争，敢于胜利的信心。
    手术之前，卫生科的同志遵照毛主席关于“不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗”和“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人”的伟大教导，对张秋菊进行细致的检查。他们从局部检查到全身检查，从一般检查到特殊检查，检查项目共达三十多个，充分掌握了第一手材料，对病人身体的全部情况了如指掌。在这个基础上，又派出一个学习小组，到曾给张秋菊治疗过的医院，查病历，问情况，征求治疗意见；还到某部队学习用毛泽东思想统帅医疗业务的宝贵经验。医务人员把大无畏的革命精神和严肃的科学态度结合起来，经过一个多月的观察病情，临床检查，反复研究，得出了一个新的结论：张秋菊长的是良性肿瘤。
    为了打好这场“拿下大肿瘤”的硬仗，卫生科全体人员反复学习毛主席的教导：“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。我们的目的一定要达到。我们的目的一定能够达到。”他们信心百倍地说：只要我们用毛泽东思想指挥战斗，这场“拿下大肿瘤”的硬仗一定能打胜。大家设想了手术中可能出现的各种问题，归纳为十个“怎么办”进行数次讨论，提出了一百二十多条解决“怎么办”的办法。在这个基础上，制定出一个比较理想的手术方案，还召开了救死扶伤誓师大会，全体医务人员向毛主席表决心。
    给张秋菊割大肿瘤的消息传到营房，指战员们都在考虑如何为做好这次手术贡献自己的力量。肿瘤太大，一般手术器械不适用，兄弟单位都积极配合，做到要人有人，要物有物，要血有血，坚决支持卫生科抢救阶级姐妹垂危生命的革命行动。许多连队的战士还庄严宣誓：向毛主席献红心，给阶级姐妹献血。
    三月二十三日是动手术的日子，部队首长亲临手术室，对医护人员完成这次手术任务给予了很大支持。手术开始了，用毛泽东思想武装起来的医护人员，在室内室外紧张地工作着。许多人战斗一整天，顾不上吃饭、喝水。手术过程中，医护人员遵照毛主席“我们需要的是热烈而镇定的情绪，紧张而有秩序的工作”的伟大教导，克服了一个又一个困难。经过十三个小时的紧张工作，终于完整地从病人身上拿下了一个罕见的九十斤重的大肿瘤。
    从死亡边缘上获救的张秋菊，对伟大领袖毛主席更是满怀着无限感激之情。当她手术后清醒过来，用手摸到自己刚刚消缩下来的腹部时，立刻流下了激动的热泪，吃力地喊道：毛主席万岁，毛主席万万岁！是您老人家救了我的命！
    张秋菊手术后的情况良好，身体日益健康。她身上的切口从左后腰到右前腹，共长九十五厘米（包括一条辅助切口），但就象一般割阑尾一样，伤口愈合得很快，手术后的第六天拆线，第八天就能下地走动了。
    人民解放军北京部队某部卫生科成功地切除了这个罕见的大肿瘤，又一次显示了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的巨大威力。现在，这件事已成了当地群众在街巷议论的新话题。广大群众一致赞扬说：这是用毛泽东思想武装起来的解放军同志们创造的人间奇迹，是无产阶级文化大革命的成果。
