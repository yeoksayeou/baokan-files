Paris, May 19 (Xinhua) - The strike wave initiated by French workers has swept across all 90 provinces in France. As of the morning of the 19th, the number of strikers exceeded two million. Workers have occupied over 120 key factories and mines. The entire railway system, as well as most of the aviation, postal, and water and land transportation, have been paralyzed, severely impacting France's economic life. French President Charles de Gaulle hurriedly cut short his overseas visit and returned to France on the evening of the 18th to deal with the situation.

The strike movement is extraordinarily swift. More and more French workers are ignoring the orders of the yellow unions and defying the opposition of the leaders of the French Communist Party, breaking past the old rules of strikes. They are occupying one factory, mine, and workplace after another, detaining bosses, managers, and directors who refuse to meet their demands, and engaging in indefinite strikes. By the morning of the 19th, workers in the Paris region had occupied 33 factories. In the Seine-Maritime department, 22 factories have been occupied, including two large factories with over 5,000 workers each.

On the 19th, all trains in France had stopped running, and railway workers occupied many important stations and facilities. Road transportation between many French cities has also been cut off. The Paris Metro has been completely paralyzed. All power distribution centers in Paris were occupied by power workers on the evening of the 18th.

The workers of the French Telecommunications General Bureau, the hub of domestic and international communications, began their strike on the morning of the 18th. The French government had to send in police forces to take over. Even the telecommunications personnel in the French Police Headquarters responsible for domestic and international communications went on strike. Long-distance telephone communications across France have been severely disrupted.

The movement to occupy factories is spreading to the mines. Coal miners have occupied several coal mines in northern France. Most of the mines in the Douai Basin have been occupied by workers. Miners have also occupied a uranium mine in the Saint-Priest-la-Prugne region of the Loire department.

While Paris students continue to occupy the French National Theater - the Odeon Theater, the workers of the Paris Opera and the Paris Light Opera also occupied these two famous theaters on the 19th. The chorus performers declared a strike in support of the workers' actions. In Cannes, hundreds of actors and critics occupied the movie theater, supporting the struggle of French workers and students, forcing the current International Film Festival to be suspended.

The struggle of workers and students has dealt a powerful blow to the rule of French monopoly capital. In recent days, French stocks have plummeted in the Paris Stock Exchange, citizens are rushing to buy gold, and housewives have begun to hoard food. Western news agencies believe that France is facing the "largest social upheaval since the end of World War II."

After receiving an urgent call from Prime Minister Georges Pompidou, French President Charles de Gaulle hurriedly returned to Paris on the evening of the 18th. On the morning of the 19th, de Gaulle hastily convened an emergency meeting at the Élysée Palace with Prime Minister Georges Pompidou, Minister of Armed Forces Pierre Messmer, Minister of the Interior Christian Fouchet, and Minister of Information Georges Gorse to deal with the "serious crisis" at hand.

In recent days, the French government has been continuously dispatching military and police forces to Paris. Large numbers of armed police and security forces are guarding important locations in the city and patrolling the streets. According to reports from Western news agencies, the French government also deployed tanks, paratroopers, and the Foreign Legion to the outskirts of Paris on the 19th, attempting to threaten workers and students.

On May 16, tens of thousands of workers at France's largest automobile monopoly, the state-owned Renault, rose up and occupied all the factories of this company scattered across the country.

    工人罢工怒潮席卷全法国
    罢工人数超过二百万，工人占领了一百二十多个重要工矿
    全部铁路系统以及大部分航空、邮电和水陆交通陷于瘫痪
    新华社十九日讯　巴黎消息：法国工人掀起的罢工怒潮，已经席卷法国九十个省份。截至十九日上午，罢工人数超过了二百万。工人占领了一百二十多个重要的工厂和矿山。整个法国的铁路系统，以及大部分的航空、邮电和水陆交通陷于瘫痪，法国的经济生活受到严重影响。法国总统戴高乐慌忙提前结束他在国外的访问，在十八日晚上赶回法国，以应付局势。
    罢工斗争的浪潮迅猛异常。越来越多的法国职工不听黄色工会的号令，不顾法修工运头子的反对，突破了过去罢工的清规戒律，占领一座又一座的工厂、矿山和工作场所，把拒绝工人要求的老板、厂长和经理扣留起来，进行无限期罢工。到十九日上午为止，在巴黎地区，工人就占领了三十三家工厂。塞纳海滨省有二十二家工厂被占领，其中包括两家有五千以上工人的大工厂。
    十九日，法国的火车已全部停驶，铁路员工占领了许多重要的车站和设施。法国许多城镇之间的公路交通也已断绝。巴黎的地下铁道已全部瘫痪。巴黎市内全部电力分配中心已在十八日晚上被电力工人占领。
    法国国内外电讯来往的枢纽——法国电讯总局的职工，十八日晨开始罢工。法国政府不得不派出警察部队进行接管。甚至在法国警察总部里负责国内外通讯联系的机电人员也举行了罢工。法国全国的电讯联络受到严重影响，长途电话已经中断。
    占领工厂的运动正在向矿山发展。煤矿工人占领了法国北部好几个煤矿。杜艾盆地的大多数矿山被工人占领。矿工还占领了卢瓦尔省圣普里斯特—拉普律涅地区的一个铀矿。
    在巴黎大学生继续占领法国国家剧院——奥代翁剧院的同时，巴黎歌剧院和巴黎轻歌剧院的职工十九日也占领了这两个著名的剧院。剧院合唱队的演员宣告罢工，支持职工的行动。在戛纳，几百名演员和评论员占领了电影放映厅，支持法国工人和学生的斗争，使目前正在那里举行的国际电影节不得不停止举行。
    工人和学生的斗争有力地打击了法国垄断资本的统治。连日来，巴黎证券交易所内法国股票急剧下跌，市民争购黄金，家庭主妇开始抢购食品。西方通讯社认为，法国面临着第二次世界大战以来“最大的社会动乱”。
    法国总统戴高乐在国外接到总理蓬皮杜告急的电话后，匆匆在十八日晚上提前赶回巴黎。十九日上午，戴高乐就慌忙地在爱丽舍宫召集总理蓬皮杜、武装部队部部长梅斯梅尔、内政部长伏歇和宣传部长戈尔斯等文武官员举行紧急会议，应付当前面临的“严重危机”。
    连日来，法国政府不断向巴黎调集军警。大批武装警察和保安部队看守着巴黎市内重要地点，并在市区不断巡逻。据西方通讯社报道，法国政府十九日还把坦克、伞兵和外籍兵团调到巴黎附近，妄图对工人和学生进行威胁。（附图片）
