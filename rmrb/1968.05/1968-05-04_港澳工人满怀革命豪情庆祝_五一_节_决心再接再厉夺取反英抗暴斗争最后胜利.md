Hong Kong workers, tempered and strengthened in the stormy struggle against British oppression, celebrated May Day with fervent revolutionary enthusiasm and unwavering confidence in victory.

In recent days, dozens of unions in Hong Kong and Kowloon held celebrations. Workers from various industries, filled with excitement, shouted slogans such as "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" and "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" The meetings were brimming with high revolutionary spirit, and workers from various industries expressed their determination to press forward and achieve the final victory in the anti-British struggle.

On the evening of April 30, about a thousand representatives from various industries in Hong Kong and Kowloon gathered at the Workers' Club to celebrate. A responsible person from the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions said at the meeting: Our great leader Chairman Mao recently issued a great call in his statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence: "The people of the world, more closely unite and launch a sustained and powerful offensive against our common enemy, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys!" We Hong Kong workers regard Chairman Mao's great call as our great task. We must link the struggle against British imperialism in Hong Kong with the overall revolutionary struggle against U.S. imperialism in the world, and carry this struggle forward.

The responsible person from the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, in his speech, thoroughly analyzed the excellent situation of the anti-British struggle of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. He said: After a year of struggle, a widespread and in-depth movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought has arisen among Hong Kong workers and patriotic compatriots. The anti-imperialist ranks have further expanded, and the spiritual outlook of the masses has undergone profound changes. They dare to struggle and are good at struggling, dealing heavy blows to the reactionary rule of the British authorities in politics, economy, and culture. We are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, further launch a new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, so that Mao Zedong Thought can be widely spread among patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, mobilize the masses, and, with the strong support of the people of our motherland, achieve the final victory in the struggle against British oppression.

Some workers and patriotic compatriots who were illegally imprisoned in concentration camps and prisons by the British authorities sent out their May Day greetings from their difficult circumstances. In their greetings, they expressed their confidence in victory, saying: Iron bars cannot lock up our fiery red hearts. We are armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The enemy's cruelty, cunning, threats, and bribes cannot shake our iron will. We solemnly swear: For a lifetime, we will read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We will be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. We are willing to dedicate our precious youth to the anti-imperialist revolutionary cause of the world's people and to achieve the final victory in the struggle against British oppression!

More than sixty unions and farmers' organizations in Macau began various activities centered on propagating Mao Zedong Thought from April 27 to celebrate May Day. At various meetings, workers from different industries resolutely expressed their determination to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, push the mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought to a new high tide, and contribute to supporting the revolutionary struggle of the people of the world.
