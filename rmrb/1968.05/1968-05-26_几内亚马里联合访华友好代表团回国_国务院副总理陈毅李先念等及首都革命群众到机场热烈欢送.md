The delegation from Guinea and Mali, led by Mali's Foreign Minister Ousmane Ba and Guinea's Foreign Minister Lansana Beavogui, concluded their visit to China and departed from Beijing by plane today.

Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Li Xiannian of the State Council, relevant officials, and over a thousand representatives and revolutionaries from Beijing's revolutionary mass organizations went to the airport to give them a warm send-off.

Today, the atmosphere at the Beijing airport was filled with the spirit of friendship and unity among the peoples of China, Guinea, and Mali. The national flags of the three countries fluttered in the wind. The welcoming crowd held banners with slogans such as: "Firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries!" "Firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia and Africa!" "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China, Guinea, and Mali!"

When the friends from Guinea and Mali arrived at the airport, the crowd recited Chairman Mao's quotations:

"The imperialists hope that we will not unite, not cooperate, not be friendly. We must answer them by strengthening our unity, friendship, and cooperation, and we must make the imperialists' plots completely fail."

"Let the people of the world unite more closely, launch a sustained and powerful attack on our common enemy, U.S. imperialism and its accomplices!"

Later, Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Li Xiannian accompanied Ousmane Ba and Lansana Beavogui and other friends from Guinea and Mali to circle the field, bidding farewell to the crowd. At this moment, the crowd raised their arms and shouted: "Long live the great unity of the peoples of the world!" "Down with U.S.-led imperialism!" "Down with modern revisionism headed by the Soviet revisionist clique!" "Down with the reactionaries of all countries!" "Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" "Wish President Sekou Toure good health!" "Wish President Modibo Keita good health!"

The friends from Guinea and Mali also continuously waved and thanked the crowd.

Members of the delegation, including Guinea's Ambassador to China, Segou Camara, and Mali's Charge d'Affaires at the Embassy, Moussa Koulibaly, as well as other diplomatic officials from the embassies of Guinea and Mali in China, went to the airport to see them off. Diplomatic envoys from various countries in China also went to the airport to see them off.

    国务院副总理陈毅、李先念，有关方面负责人，以及首都革命群众组织代表和革命群众一千多人，前往机场热烈欢送。
    今天，首都机场洋溢着中国和几内亚、马里三国人民之间的友好团结气氛。中国、几内亚、马里三国国旗迎风飘扬。欢送的群众高举着横幅标语，上面写着：“坚决支持各国人民的革命斗争！”“坚决支持亚非人民的革命斗争！”“中国、几内亚、马里三国人民之间的友谊万岁！”
    当几内亚、马里朋友来到机场时，欢送的人们齐声朗读毛主席语录：
    “殖民主义者希望我们不团结，不合作，不友好。我们必须用加强团结、加强友好合作来回答它们，我们必须使殖民主义者的阴谋彻底破产。”
    “全世界人民更紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻！”
    随后，陈毅、李先念副总理陪同乌斯曼·巴和兰萨纳·贝阿沃吉等几内亚、马里朋友绕场一周，同欢送的人们告别。这时群众振臂高呼：“全世界人民大团结万岁！”“打倒以美国为首的帝国主义！”“打倒以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义！”“打倒各国反动派！”“无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利万岁！”“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“祝杜尔总统健康！”“祝凯塔总统健康！”
    几内亚、马里朋友也不断地向欢送的群众招手致谢。
    代表团成员、几内亚驻中国大使塞古·卡马拉和马里驻中国大使馆临时代办姆萨·库里巴利，以及几内亚、马里驻中国大使馆其他外交官员前往机场送行。各国驻中国的外交使节也到机场送行。
