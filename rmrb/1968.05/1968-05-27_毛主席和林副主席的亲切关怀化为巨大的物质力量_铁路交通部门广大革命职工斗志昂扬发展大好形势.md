The spirit of the National Railway and Transportation Conference is being rapidly implemented. Broad masses of revolutionary workers have launched a great exposure, criticism, and struggle against a handful of capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries within the Party. The revolutionary criticism has driven the transportation production to a new high. In May, the loading level of the national railway system has rapidly increased, continuously creating the best results so far this year. The order of train operation and various quality indicators have all improved significantly. The shipping volume of the national shipping industry in mid-May increased by 7.8% compared to the beginning of the month.

New China News Agency, May 26th: Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao personally approved the convening of the National Railway and Transportation Conference and received all the representatives attending the conference, which greatly encouraged the revolutionary cadres and broad masses of revolutionary workers on the railway and transportation front.

After the successful conclusion of the National Railway and Transportation Conference on May 15th, representatives from various places immediately rushed back to their original units to convey the spirit of the conference with the greatest enthusiasm and the fastest speed. At present, a high tide of great publicity, study, and implementation of the spirit of this conference has risen in the railway and transportation departments across the country. On the vast transportation lines of land and water crisscrossing the motherland, from important railway hubs to factories, stations, and sections, from ports and docks to ships that are about to set sail or are under maintenance, revolutionary workers have been holding various meetings in recent days to convey and study the spirit of the conference, formulate measures to implement the conference resolutions. Broad masses of revolutionary workers are full of revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm, determined to better shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production, to seize a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to support the great development of industrial and agricultural production, to strengthen national defense construction and war preparedness, to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and to support the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. They said, we must achieve better results in revolution and production, develop the favorable situation, and respond to Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's care for us.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the condition of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the broad revolutionary masses led by it and the reactionary Kuomintang, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Revolutionary cadres and broad masses of revolutionary workers in various places of the railway and transportation departments have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teaching, discussed the new characteristics and new tasks of class struggle in the current situation, further strengthened the consciousness of class struggle, and heightened revolutionary vigilance. They said, railway and transportation are the lifelines of the national economy. The enemies of the proletariat will inevitably adopt more concealed and more vicious means to sabotage our great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination, and to sabotage transportation production. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, direct the spearhead of struggle against China's Khrushchev and a handful of the biggest capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents in the railway and transportation departments, launch a sustained and fierce attack on them, expose and criticize them thoroughly, and fight them to the end; we must root out hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries. We must resolutely oppose right opportunism, right capitulationism, and right splitism, thoroughly smash the rightist reversal wind, and smash all the tricks of the class enemies, and carry the great political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end.

The revolutionary cadres and revolutionary workers of the Shanghai Railway Bureau said, a handful of class enemies always try every means to sabotage railway transportation to sabotage the Cultural Revolution. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, we, together with the revolutionary cadres of Jiangsu, exposed the counter-revolutionary clique of the remnants of the reactionary Kuomintang protected by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, such as Li Shunzhi and Qi Zhong, smashed their evil plots, and ensured the smooth operation of railway transportation. But the struggle has not ended. We must remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," take the initiative to launch a fierce attack on class enemies, and sweep all traitors, spies, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks into the garbage heap of history. Inspired by the spirit of the conference, the broad masses of revolutionary workers on the Shanghai railway and transportation front have intensified class struggle, further deepened the revolutionary criticism, and severely struck the enemies of the proletariat. The broad masses of revolutionary workers of the Shijiazhuang Railway Division, according to the spirit of the National Railway and Transportation Conference, seriously analyzed the situation of class struggle within the division, exposed a handful of class enemies who attempted to sabotage the grassroots revolutionary committee. The broad masses of revolutionary workers took these class enemies as live targets for criticism and struggle, which strongly consolidated and developed the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination of the proletarian revolutionary cadres. The workers of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, inspired by the National Railway and Transportation Conference, carried out a resounding revolutionary criticism, holding five criticism meetings in nearly ten days, making a handful of class enemies who sabotaged the revolution and production fall into the vast ocean of people's war. The revolutionary workers of the four railway regions of Changsha, Zhuzhou, Yueyang, and Loudi in the Changsha Railway Division further sounded the drums of revolutionary criticism, launching a great exposure, criticism, and struggle against a handful of capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries within the Party. The revolutionary workers of units such as Qinhuangdao Port, Shanghai Port Authority, and Dalian Port have recently focused on revolutionary criticism and fiercely struck the rightist reversal wind of the class enemies. The revolutionary criticism has driven the transportation production situation to be better and better.

The proletarian revolutionary cadres and broad masses of revolutionary workers in the national railway and transportation departments, in the short period of time during and after the National Railway and Transportation Conference, further implemented the great instruction of the great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and war preparedness," and quickly launched a new high tide of transportation production. Since May, the loading level of the national railway system has rapidly increased, continuously creating the best loading results so far this year; the order of train operation and various quality indicators have all improved significantly. From May 21st to 25th compared to May 1st to 5th, the number of loaded cars increased by 13%, and the number of unloaded cars increased by 11%. The broad masses of revolutionary workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau have applied the revolutionary enthusiasm released in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to transportation production, and from stations and sections to teams and groups are formulating plans and measures to implement the conference resolutions. Revolutionary workers proudly said: We, the working class, have iron shoulders to bear the dual burdens of revolution and production! At present, the transportation production situation of the Beijing Railway Bureau is getting better and better. The broad masses of revolutionary workers of the Shanghai Railway Bureau are determined to better complete the glorious tasks assigned by the great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. Recently, the average daily cargo handling volume of the entire bureau has greatly increased compared to the past. The members of various levels of revolutionary committees of the Harbin Railway Bureau and the supporting leftist soldiers went deep into the production front line, grasped revolution and promoted production with the masses, and the daily loading volume has significantly increased compared to before the conference. Many stations and teams of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau have formulated agreements to grasp revolution and promote production, and broad masses of revolutionary workers have been firmly on duty, bravely shouldering heavy burdens, and continuously creating new achievements in transportation. The number of loaded and unloaded cars in the entire bureau in mid-May has increased compared to the beginning of the month. The detached workers of the Zhengzhou North Station Revolutionary Committee formed a shock team, went deep into the production front line, and grasped revolution and promoted production with the broad masses of workers, achieving good results. The average daily number of loaded and unloaded cars in recent days in railway bureaus such as Shenyang and Lanzhou has also significantly increased compared to before the conference.

The revolutionary workers of the highway and shipping departments, after the National Railway and Transportation Conference, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," grasped revolution and vigorously promoted production. According to statistics, the cargo throughput of fifteen coastal ports in mid-May has further increased compared to the beginning of the month, and the shipping volume of the national shipping industry in mid-May has increased by 7.8% compared to the beginning of the month. The revolutionary workers on the Yangtze River shipping line, in the current busy transportation season, overcame the difficulties of large transportation volume and insufficient transportation tools, adopted various methods to increase the load, and accelerated the turnover of ships, making the transportation volume on the entire line rise sharply. The Wuhan Branch of the Yangtze River Navigation Company also created a new record of transporting ten thousand tons per day. The workers fighting on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau transportation sector responded to the call of the conference with practical actions. Some sections of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway have experienced serious spring flooding, and the road maintenance section workers, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, with the help of the responsible comrades of the Qinghai Provincial Highway Revolutionary Committee, worked day and night in the rain to repair the road and ensure its smooth operation.

Vice Chairman Lin pointed out: "Mao Zedong Thought is the unified action program for the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country." The revolutionary workers of various places of the railway and transportation departments pointed out in their study and discussion of the spirit of the National Railway and Transportation Conference that all the great achievements made in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production in the past two years are great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They are determined to further establish and run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the current favorable situation, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works more diligently, to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to command everything and promote everything, to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination of the proletarian revolutionary cadres, to grasp class struggle, to carry out the revolutionary criticism deeply and persistently, to carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform of their own units, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, to let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly over every position on the national railway and transportation front, and to turn the national railway and transportation departments into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought!

    毛主席和林副主席的亲切关怀化为巨大的物质力量  铁路交通部门广大革命职工斗志昂扬发展大好形势
    全国铁路交通会议精神正在迅速落实。广大革命职工对党内一小撮走资派、叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子，展开了大揭发、大批判、大斗争。革命大批判带动了运输生产新高潮。进入五月，全国铁路系统装车水平迅速上升，连续创造今年以来最好成绩，列车运行秩序和各项质量指标都有很大提高。全国船舶运输量五月中旬比上旬上升百分之七点八。
    新华社二十六日讯　我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席亲自批准召开全国铁路、交通会议，并且接见了参加会议的全体代表，极大地鼓舞了全国铁路、交通战线的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工。
    全国铁路、交通会议在五月十五日胜利结束后，各地代表马上赶回原单位，以最大的热情和最快的速度进行传达。目前，一个对这次会议精神大宣传、大学习、大落实的高潮已经在全国铁路、交通部门兴起。在辽阔祖国纵横交错的水陆交通线上，从重要的铁路枢纽到工厂、站、段，从港口、码头到正在出航或检修的轮船上，广大革命职工连日来纷纷召开各种会议，传达和学习会议精神，制定贯彻执行大会决议的措施。广大革命职工斗志昂扬，干劲冲天，决心更好地挑起革命、生产两副重担，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，为支援工农业生产的大发展，为加强国防建设和战备，为支援兄弟的越南人民抗美救国战争和支援世界人民的革命斗争，做出更大的贡献。他们说，我们一定要在革命和生产上做出更好的成绩，发展大好形势，来回答毛主席和林副主席对我们的关怀。
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”各地铁路、交通部门的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工反复学习毛主席的这一教导，讨论了当前形势下阶级斗争的新特点和新任务，进一步加强了阶级斗争的观念，提高了革命警惕性。他们说，铁路、交通是国民经济的大动脉，无产阶级的敌人必然会采取更加隐蔽、更加毒辣的手段，来破坏我们的革命大联合和革命三结合，破坏运输生产。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把斗争矛头对准中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在铁路、交通部门的代理人，向他们发动持久的猛烈的进攻，把他们批深批透、斗倒斗臭，进一步清除他们散布的修正主义毒素；我们要把隐藏的叛徒、特务和反革命分子挖出来。要坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾投降主义、右倾分裂主义，彻底粉碎右倾翻案的妖风，粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计，把这场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底。
    上海铁路局的无产阶级革命派和革命职工说，一小撮阶级敌人总是千方百计妄图破坏铁路运输来破坏文化大革命。我们在人民解放军帮助下，同江苏的无产阶级革命派一起，揪出了由党内一小撮走资派包庇下来的国民党反动派余孽李顺之、戚拯之流组织的反革命小集团，粉碎了他们的罪恶阴谋，保证了铁路运输的畅通。可是，斗争并没有结束。我们要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，主动地向阶级敌人发动猛烈的进攻，把混进革命队伍的叛徒、特务、地、富、反、坏、右等统统扫进历史的垃圾堆。在会议精神的鼓舞下，上海铁路、交通战线的广大革命职工狠抓阶级斗争，更加深入地展开了革命的大批判，狠狠地打击无产阶级的敌人。石家庄铁路分局的广大革命职工，根据全国铁路、交通会议的精神，认真分析了分局内部阶级斗争的形势，挖出了一小撮妄图破坏基层革命委员会的阶级敌人。广大革命职工把这些阶级敌人作为活靶子，进行了批判斗争，有力地巩固和发展了无产阶级革命派的革命大联合和革命三结合。郑州铁路局职工，在全国铁路、交通会议的鼓舞下，把革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈，近十多天来连续召开了五次批判大会，使一小撮破坏革命，破坏生产的阶级敌人陷入“人民战争”的汪洋大海之中。长沙铁路分局的长沙、株洲、岳阳、娄底四个铁路地区的革命职工，进一步擂响了革命大批判的战鼓，对党内一小撮走资派、叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子，展开了大揭发，大批判，大斗争。秦皇岛港、上海港务局、大连港等单位的革命职工，最近都狠抓革命大批判，猛击阶级敌人的翻案风。革命的大批判，推动着运输生产形势越来越好。
    全国铁路、交通部门的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，在全国铁路、交通会议开会期间和会议结束以后的短短几天内，进一步贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大指示，迅速掀起运输生产新高潮。全国铁路系统进入五月以来，装车水平迅速上升，连续创造了今年以来最好的装车成绩；列车运行秩序和各项质量指标都有很大提高。五月二十一日到二十五日与五月一日到五日比较，装车数提高百分之十三，卸车数提高百分之十一。北京铁路局广大革命职工把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的革命干劲运用到运输生产上去，从站、段到班、组正纷纷制定贯彻会议决议的规划和措施。革命职工们豪迈地说：我们工人阶级一副铁肩就是要挑起革命和生产两副重担！目前，北京铁路局运输生产形势越来越好。上海铁路局的广大革命职工决心更好地完成伟大领袖毛主席和党中央交给的光荣任务。近来，全铁路局平均每天的货物装卸量比过去大大提高。哈尔滨铁路局各级革命委员会的成员和支左解放军同志深入生产第一线，和群众一起抓革命促生产，目前的日装车数比会议前显著增加。郑州铁路局不少车站、班组订立了抓革命、促生产公约，广大革命职工坚守岗位，勇挑重担，不断创造出运输新成绩。全铁路局五月中旬的装车数和卸车数都分别比上旬增加。郑州北站革命委员会的脱产工作人员组成突击队，深入生产第一线，同广大职工一起抓革命、促生产，取得了好的成效。沈阳、兰州等铁路局近来每天平均装车数和卸车数，也比会议前有显著增长。
    公路、航运部门的革命职工，在全国铁路、交通会议以后，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，狠抓革命，猛促生产。据统计，沿海十五个港口的吞吐量，五月中旬比上旬又有提高，全国船舶运输量五月中旬比上旬上升百分之七点八。长江航运线上的革命职工，在当前运输繁忙的季节里，克服运输量大、运输工具不足的困难，采用多种方法提高载重量，同时加速船舶周转，使全线运输量直线上升。长江航运公司武汉分公司还创造了日运万吨的新纪录。战斗在青藏高原的交通部门的工人，以实际行动响应会议的号召。青藏公路有些地段发生了严重的春季泛浆现象，养路段的职工，依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，在青海省公路局革委会负责人的帮助下，夜以继日地冒雨抢修，保证了公路畅通。
    林副主席指示说：“毛泽东思想是全党、全军、全国人民的统一的行动纲领”。各地铁路、交通部门革命职工在学习、讨论全国铁路、交通会议精神的时候指出，两年来无产阶级文化大革命和生产上取得的一切伟大成就，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。他们决心在当前大好形势下，进一步大办、办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，更加努力地活学活用毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅一切、推动一切，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，巩固和发展无产阶级革命派的革命大联合和革命三结合，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，开展本单位的斗、批、改，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全国铁路、交通战线上的每一个阵地，把全国铁路、交通部门办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校！
