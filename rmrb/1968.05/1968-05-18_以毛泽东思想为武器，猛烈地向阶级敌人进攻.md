The great leader Chairman Mao personally directed the creation of the great historical document—the May 16 Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966. This document creatively developed Marxism-Leninism and systematically addressed the issue of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. The past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have been two years of great victories for Chairman Mao's brilliant theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary people under its leadership against the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The fierce class struggle of the past two years has made us deeply realize that the focus of class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat is still the issue of political power. The main targets of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat are a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, who are representatives of the bourgeoisie infiltrating the organs of proletarian dictatorship. They represent the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Once the opportunity arises, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. As Chairman Mao pointed out in the Circular, "Our struggle against them can only be a life-and-death struggle."

The victory of the "January Revolution" and the seizure of power by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat have made the struggle even more acute and complex. We have pressed forward and launched a thorough revolutionary criticism and struggle, and at the same time, we have exposed a handful of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries hiding in various corners.

The past two years of struggle have proven that although a handful of class enemies have been exposed by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, they are not willing to meet their doom. They frequently change their counter-revolutionary strategies, plot conspiracies, and attempt to overthrow the newly born revolutionary committees, undermine the great People's Liberation Army of China, and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Recently, they have again stirred up a rightist reversal wind. All this has made us deeply realize that after the revolutionary masses of the proletariat have won the power struggle, they must arm themselves with Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and take the initiative to launch fierce attacks on the enemies of the proletariat, not giving the enemy any chance to breathe, and firmly grasping the initiative in the struggle against the enemy.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The current Cultural Revolution is only the first one; in the future, there will inevitably be many more. The victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided over a very long historical period. If things are not handled well, capitalist restoration will be possible at any time. All Party members and the people of the whole country should not think that one or two, three or four Cultural Revolutions will make everything peaceful. Be very careful, never relax vigilance." We must always remember Chairman Mao's great teachings, never forget class struggle, and never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat. At present, we must resolutely oppose right opportunism, right capitulationism, and right splitism, and thoroughly smash the rightist reversal wind. We must carry forward the resolute and thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, redouble our efforts, press forward, and launch more fierce attacks on the class enemies. We must carry out a thorough and prolonged revolutionary criticism and struggle, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our units, and strive to win a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and forever consolidate and develop this victory.

    伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的伟大的历史文件——中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，系统地解决了无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的问题。两年来的无产阶级文化大革命，就是毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续革命的光辉理论取得伟大胜利的两年。
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”两年来急风暴雨的阶级斗争，使我们深深体会到，无产阶级专政下的阶级斗争，焦点还是政权问题。无产阶级专政下继续革命的主要对象，是党内一小撮走资派，他们是一批混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物。他们代表着国民党反动派、帝国主义、资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右的利益。一旦时机成熟，他们就要夺取政权，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。正如毛主席在《通知》中指出的，“我们对他们的斗争也只能是一场你死我活的斗争”。
      “一月革命”胜利，无产阶级革命派掌权以后，斗争仍然十分尖锐、复杂。我们乘胜前进，深入开展了革命大批判，同时把隐藏在各个角落里的一小撮叛徒、特务、反革命分子挖了出来。
    两年来的斗争实践证明，一小撮阶级敌人虽然被无产阶级革命派和革命群众揪出来了，但他们不甘心自己的灭亡，他们不时地改变反革命策略，玩弄阴谋，妄图颠覆新诞生的革命委员会，动摇伟大的中国人民解放军，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。最近他们又刮起一股右倾翻案妖风。这一切，使我们更深刻地认识到，无产阶级革命派取得夺权斗争胜利以后，一定要用毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论武装自己，主动地向无产阶级的敌人展开猛烈的进攻，不让敌人有任何喘息的机会，牢牢掌握对敌斗争的主动权。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“现在的文化大革命，仅仅是第一次，以后还必然要进行多次。革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。全体党员，全国人民，不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。”我们一定要牢记毛主席的这一伟大教导，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政。当前，要坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾投降主义、右倾分裂主义，彻底粉碎右倾翻案妖风。我们要发扬无产阶级的坚决彻底革命精神，鼓足干劲，乘胜前进，向阶级敌人展开更猛烈的进攻，深入持久地开展革命大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改，誓夺无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，并永远巩固这个胜利，发展这个胜利。
