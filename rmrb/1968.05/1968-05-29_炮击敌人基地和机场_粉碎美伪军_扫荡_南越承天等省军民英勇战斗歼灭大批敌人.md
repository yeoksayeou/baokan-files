The people's liberation armed forces and people of various ethnic groups in the western part of the 12th Highway in the province of Thua Thien, Vietnam, fought bravely from April 19 to May 15. They annihilated more than 2,200 enemy troops, shot down or destroyed nearly 200 enemy aircraft, and destroyed more than 100 enemy vehicles.

On April 19 and 21, the U.S. aggressors air-dropped more than 10,000 enemy troops into various highlands on both sides of the 12th Highway, attempting to launch a large-scale "sweep" in this area. However, as soon as the U.S. aggressors landed, they were met with a fierce counterattack from the well-prepared people's liberation armed forces and various ethnic groups, resulting in the destruction of 35 enemy aircraft and the deaths of 300 U.S. aggressors. On the same day, the people's liberation armed forces also continuously surrounded and attacked the U.S. aggressors who had been air-dropped into other areas near the 12th Highway, dealing a heavy blow to the enemy's "sweep" from the outset.

Subsequently, the people's liberation armed forces continued to annihilate a large number of enemy troops. On May 5, the people's liberation armed forces annihilated more than 200 enemy troops between Phu Dien and Da Lang. On May 4 and 12, they annihilated more than 300 enemy troops in the A Luoi area, destroying more than 50 enemy helicopters and more than 20 enemy vehicles.

Meanwhile, the guerrilla forces in this area also cooperated with the liberation army to annihilate the enemy and attack enemy aircraft. The guerrilla forces of Hong Trung, Hong Ngu, and Hong Van communes together shot down 10 U.S. aircraft.

Under the siege and attacks of the military and people of Thua Thien West, the U.S. bandits were completely in a passive and isolated situation and were forced to withdraw from the 12th Highway area on May 10. The military and people of this area also annihilated a large number of enemy troops on the enemy's retreat route.

According to a report from the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the people's liberation armed forces in the Hue area continuously shelled the enemy's Phu Bai airfield on May 12 and 13, destroying the runway and apron, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses and rendering the airfield completely paralyzed.

On May 13, the people's liberation armed forces in Thua Thien Province shelled the U.S. military base in Tam Ky, northwest of Hue City, hitting the enemy command center, airfield, barracks, and warehouses. They destroyed 10 helicopters, 15 vehicles, and killed many U.S. aggressors. Three fires broke out inside the base, causing ammunition depots to explode. The guerrilla forces in the western part of the 12th Highway in Thua Thien Province shot down six U.S. aggressor aircraft with light weapons on May 12 and 13.

On May 9, the people's liberation armed forces in Quang Tri Province fiercely intercepted two battalions of U.S. aggressors attempting to plunder food in Chau Thuan County, annihilating 230 enemy troops and wiping out an entire company.

From May 8 to 11, the guerrilla forces in Hai Lang County, Quang Tri Province, continuously sabotaged the U.S. aggressors' oil supply system and blew up 20 vehicles, including 15 armored vehicles, killing nearly 100 U.S. aggressors.
