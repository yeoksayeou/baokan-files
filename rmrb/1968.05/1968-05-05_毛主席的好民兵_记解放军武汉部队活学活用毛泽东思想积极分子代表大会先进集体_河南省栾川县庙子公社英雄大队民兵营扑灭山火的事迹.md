Revolution Tempered Hearts, Blazing Fire Tests True Gold.

At the conference of active learners and appliers of Chairman Mao Zedong Thought of the Wuhan Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, people enthusiastically praised the heroic deeds of the militiamen of the Heroic Brigade of Miaozi Commune in Luanchuan County, Henan Province, in extinguishing a mountain fire, calling them "good militiamen who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao."

Our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which blew like a spring breeze across the vast rural areas of the western part of Henan and the Fuyu Mountains. On January 15 of last year, following the great helmsman Chairman Mao, the militiamen of the Heroic Brigade of Miaozi Commune, who stood at the forefront of the struggle, were either writing Chairman Mao's quotations at the village entrance or writing big-character posters exposing the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev. Suddenly, a fire broke out on a mountain five li away, with flames shooting into the sky.

The Fuyu Mountains are high and densely forested, a major timber-producing area of the state. The mountain fire seriously threatened the forest area and the safety of the lives and property of the mountain villagers.

Fire is the order! Chairman Mao's good militiamen dare to climb mountains of knives and dare to charge into seas of fire! Militiamen Zhang Shuai, Yang Qingyun, Yang An, Cheng Wujin, Lou Jinwang, Meng Maier, and Ma Xueliu discovered the fire at different locations and almost simultaneously rushed towards the fire scene.

The mountain where the fire started was towering, with deep grass and dense forests, steep cliffs, and no way to climb. They loudly recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "Firmly resolve, fear no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to win victory." They climbed the trees, stepped into the cracks, with hands and feet injured, bravely climbed to the top of the mountain, and rushed into the fire scene.

The mountain wind howled, smoke rolled, and the fire turned half the sky red. The sound of exploding rocks could be heard from more than ten li away, and the raging flames rushed towards them. The good militiamen who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao fear neither heaven nor earth and are fearless in the face of the flames. Knowing that the fire burns people, they charge into the sea of fire. They stood in a line, clearing leaves, blocking the fire path, breaking branches, and extinguishing the flames. Wherever the fire burned, they fought it back. Their hands were worn out, their eyebrows were burned off, and their faces were covered with blisters, but not a single person cried out in pain. After more than an hour of heroic struggle, the flames on the mountain top were finally extinguished.

Just as they were filled with the joy of victory and singing "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," they suddenly discovered another blaze on the northern slope of the mountain. This fire was even more ferocious, with flames reaching tens of meters high. The heroic militiamen remembered Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, fearing no sacrifice, fearing no fatigue, and continuous fighting (that is, fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." They pounced on the big fire in the mountain like tigers. At this time, the wind was blowing stronger and the fire was burning more fiercely. Soon, the forest became a sea of fire. In an instant, the big fire surrounded them. The fire burned their eyes, and the thick smoke choked their breath. Several comrades fainted several times but got up and continued to fight. "We die for the people, and it is a worthy death." Chairman Mao's teachings echoed in their ears, and the images of Zhang Zide, Huang Jiguang, Lei Feng, Liu Yingjun, and the 32111 Heroic Collective encouraged them to advance. The militia commander Ma Xueliu shouted loudly: "Comrades, the time to test us has come. Be loyal to Chairman Mao, protect state property, reclaim the mountains from the flames, and fight to the end with the flames!" Everyone answered in unison: "We fight to defend Mao Zedong Thought while alive, and we dedicate our lives to defend Mao Zedong Thought while dead. We will not rest until the mountain fire is extinguished!"

At this moment, more than 2,000 soldiers, workers, peasants, Red Guards, militiamen, and cadres from state organs rushed from all directions to finally extinguish the mountain fire and save a large area of forest. However, our heroic militiamen Cheng Wujin, Zhang Shuai, Yang Qingyun, Lou Jinwang, Yang An, and Meng Maier sacrificed their precious lives in the battle. The militia commander Ma Xueliu was seriously burned.

Sailing the seas depends on the helmsman, all things grow with the sun, and heroes are nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. These heroes who fought in the sea of fire are models of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in their daily lives.

Zhang Shuai was a good comrade who harbored deep proletarian feelings for our great leader Chairman Mao. Before liberation, he was soaked in bitter yellow water. Through bitter-sweet remembrance, his class consciousness greatly improved, and he deeply loved Chairman Mao from the bottom of his heart. He eagerly learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, learning a little and using a little. Every day after work, he would carry water and chop firewood for the poor and lower-middle peasants, and often wash clothes for the water conservancy team members and spread manure for the team. Everyone wanted to give him work points, but he refused. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he vowed to defend Chairman Mao with a red heart, leading the militiamen to rebel against his father's mistakes at work and helping his father correct his mistakes. In the battle against the sea of fire, he held a fire-fighting stick, bravely advancing. His cotton jacket caught fire, and he threw it off, bare-chested, wielding a wooden stick to fight the flames, continuing to fight until his heroic sacrifice.

Yang An also had a bloody family history. His head still bears the scars of being beaten by a rich peasant in the old society. With his deep class feelings of infinite love and loyalty to Chairman Mao, he wrote in his notebook of studying Chairman Mao's works: "Class hatred can never be forgotten, a bloody family history is carved on the chest, bitter as gall in the past, sweet as honey today. If it were not for the leader Chairman Mao, how could we turn over a new leaf and see the sun? I will study Chairman Mao's books forever, and I will not lose my way in the great winds and waves." In the battle against the flames, he charged into the sea of fire time and time again, and when his fire-fighting tools were burned, he used his hands to dig soil to extinguish the fire.

He harbored deep hatred for the class enemies and infinite love for Chairman Mao, sacrificing his young life.

Lou Jinwang was an outstanding propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought. Almost every village and roadside in the entire brigade had Mao Zedong's quotations and revolutionary slogans written by him. He was about to get married, and his mother gave him money to buy some cloth at the market, but he immediately thought of the brigade's need for red paint to write Mao Zedong's quotations. So, he ran to the market and bought several boxes of red paint. He said, "This is more important than buying cloth. Propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought is the top priority for us poor and lower-middle peasants." He was extremely indignant about China's Khrushchev's heinous crimes of resisting the publication and distribution of Chairman Mao's works. He eagerly wanted to obtain a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he once got up at dawn and returned at dusk, running many miles, but still could not buy one. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, and he fiercely criticized China's Khrushchev's heinous crimes of opposing the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought. Lou Jinwang's deep proletarian feelings of infinite love for Chairman Mao, infinite love for Mao Zedong Thought, and infinite love for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line deeply educated the broad revolutionary masses.

Cheng Wujin was the leader of the mass movement to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works in the brigade and a pioneer in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Before his death, he went to Beijing with the Red Guards to link up and was inspected by our great helmsman Chairman Mao. After returning from Beijing, he led the militiamen to fiercely rebel against the capitalist roaders and the ghosts and monsters. On the morning of the day he sacrificed himself, he was writing Mao Zedong's quotations on the street with infinite love for the great leader Chairman Mao. In the battle to extinguish the fire, he fought to his last breath, standing proudly with a half-broken hoe handle in his hand, as if ready to charge forward.

Yang Qingyun was a female teacher in a people-run primary school. She usually saved money by eating and wearing less, using the state subsidy to buy Mao Zedong's works for the children of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Her mirror had been used for ten years and was blurry, but when others advised her to buy a new one, she said, "The quality of the mirror for looking at my face is not important to me. But the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought cannot be missing. It can reflect the dust in the depths of the soul and help me improve my worldview." Her cotton jacket had been worn for ten years and was completely faded. Someone said, "Qingyun, you are such a big girl, why don't you make a new jacket?" She said, "The jacket may fade, but it can still keep me warm. If people's thoughts leave Mao Zedong Thought, our country will change color." She wrote in her diary: "For the people's interests, climb the knife mountain, charge into the sea of fire, be crushed to pieces, and never change heart." She completely fulfilled her iron-clad vow to Chairman Mao in the battle to extinguish the mountain fire.

Although Meng Maier was only fourteen years old, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought nurtured her into a girl with a strong will. She had only studied for three years, and when she opened "Quotations from Chairman Mao," there were many unfamiliar characters. She studied hard and used them, memorizing many aphorisms from "Quotations from Chairman Mao." In the autumn of her thirteenth year, she bravely took over the position of women's team leader, leading the women to excellently complete the autumn tasks. The community members all said she was a good steel. In the battle to extinguish the mountain fire, she used a broom to fight the fire, and when the broom was burned, she used stones to smash the fire and stomped on it with her feet. Until the flames took her young life, she still tightly held a stone that she had not thrown out to fight the fire.

These comrades sacrificed themselves for the people's interests. Their advanced deeds of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought and bravely extinguishing the mountain fire will never be forgotten by the people and will become a good example for people to learn from.

　　毛主席的好民兵
    记解放军武汉部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会先进集体——河南省栾川县庙子公社英雄大队民兵营扑灭山火的事迹
    革命炼红心，烈火见真金。
    在人民解放军武汉部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会上，人们热情地赞扬河南省栾川县庙子公社英雄大队民兵营的民兵扑灭山火的英雄事迹，称他们是“无限忠于毛主席的好民兵”。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，象春风一样吹遍了豫西伏牛山区广大农村。去年一月十五日，紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，站在斗争最前列的庙子公社英雄大队的民兵们，有的在村头写毛主席语录，有的在写揭露中国赫鲁晓夫滔天罪行的大字报。忽然，对面五里以外的山上起了火，火光冲天。
    伏牛山区，山高林密，是国家的一个木材产区。山火严重地威胁着林区，威胁着山区农民生命财产安全。
    火光就是命令！毛主席的好民兵刀山敢上，火海敢闯！民兵张拴、杨青云、杨安、程五斤、娄金旺、孟麦娥、马学六，在不同的地点发现火光，几乎同时出发向火场飞奔。
    起火的大山，高耸云端，草深林密，陡壁悬崖，没法上去。他们高声朗读毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”手攀树根，脚蹬石缝，手擦破了，脚撞伤了，英勇地爬上了山顶，冲到了火场。
    山风吼叫，烟雾滚滚，火烧红了半边天，十几里以外可以听到山石的爆炸声，熊熊的烈火迎面扑来。无限忠于毛主席的好民兵，天不怕，地不怕，面对烈火毫无惧色。明知火烧人，偏向火海冲。他们七个人一字排开，除落叶，断火道，折树枝，扑火苗，火烧向南就打到南，火烧向北就打到北。大家手磨破了，眉毛烧光了，脸上烧起一串串血泡，可没有一个人叫一声疼。经过一个多小时的英勇搏斗，山顶上的烈火终于被扑灭了。
    正当他们满怀胜利的喜悦，高唱《大海航行靠舵手》的时候，忽然发现北坡山腰间又腾起一股山火。这股山火的来势更为凶猛，火柱有几十米高。英雄的民兵牢记毛主席的伟大教导：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”个个猛虎般地扑向山腰里的大火。这时，风越刮越大，火越烧越猛，很快地林场就成了一片火海。转眼间，大火把他们包围，大火烧得睁不开眼，浓烟呛得喘不过气，好几个同志几次昏倒在地，爬起来又继续战斗。“我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”毛主席的教导在他们耳边响起，张思德、黄继光、雷锋、刘英俊和三二一一一英雄集体的形象在鼓舞他们前进。民兵营长马学六大声喊道：“同志们，考验我们的时候到了，忠于毛主席，保护国家财产，向烈火夺回山林，和烈火搏斗到底！”大家齐声回答：“生为捍卫毛泽东思想而战斗，死为捍卫毛泽东思想而献身，不扑灭山火誓不罢休！”
    就在这时，解放军指战员、工人、农民、红卫兵小将、民兵和国家机关干部两千多人，纷纷从四面八方赶来了，终于扑灭了山火，保住了大片森林。但是我们的英雄民兵程五斤、张拴、杨青云、娄金旺、杨安、孟麦娥在战斗中献出了宝贵的生命。民兵营长马学六受了严重的烧伤。
    大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，英雄靠毛泽东思想哺育成长。这些奋战火海的英雄，平时就是活学活用毛泽东思想的模范。
    张拴是一个对我们伟大领袖毛主席怀着无比深厚的无产阶级感情的好同志。他在解放前是黄连苦水泡大的。经过忆苦思甜，他的阶级觉悟大大提高，打心眼里无限热爱毛主席，如饥似渴地活学活用毛主席著作，学一点，用一点。他每天一下工，就给贫下中农担水、劈柴，还经常给水利专业队的同志洗衣服，给队里散粪。大家要给他记工分，他不要。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他怀着誓死捍卫毛主席的一颗红心，带领民兵造了他父亲在工作中错误的反，帮助他父亲改正错误。在奋战火海中，他手持打火棍棒，英勇向前，棉袄烧着了，他甩掉棉袄，光着膀子抡起木棍与烈火搏斗，一直战斗到壮烈牺牲。
    杨安也有一部血泪斑斑的家史。他的头上还留着在旧社会被富农打过的伤疤，他怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的阶级感情，在自己学习毛主席著作笔记本上写下了这样一段话：“阶级仇恨永难忘，血泪家史刻胸膛，从前苦得象黄连，今天甜得似蜜糖。不是领袖毛主席，怎能翻身见太阳，永世苦读毛主席的书，大风大浪不迷向。”在与烈火搏斗时，他一次又一次地冲进火海，打火工具烧坏了，就用手挖土压火。
    他怀着对阶级敌人的深仇大恨，怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，献出了年轻的生命。
    娄金旺是个出色的毛泽东思想宣传员。全大队几乎每一个村庄、每条路旁，都有他亲手写上的毛主席语录和革命标语。他快要结婚了，母亲给他钱，叫他上集买些花布，但他立即想到现在大队书写毛主席语录正缺红漆，于是他跑到集上买了几盒红漆拿回来了。他说：“这比买花布重要，宣传毛泽东思想是咱们贫下中农的头等大事。”他对中国赫鲁晓夫抵制毛主席著作出版发行的滔天罪行无比痛恨。他渴望得到一部《毛泽东选集》，无产阶级文化大革命以前，他有一次起五更，搭黄昏，跑了很多路，都没有买到。无产阶级文化大革命开始了，他狠揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。娄金旺无限热爱毛主席、无限热爱毛泽东思想、无限热爱毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的深厚的无产阶级感情，深深地教育了广大革命群众。
    程五斤是大队活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的带头人，是无产阶级文化大革命中的闯将。他生前同红卫兵一道到北京串连，受到我们伟大统帅毛主席的检阅。从北京回来后，他同民兵一道大造走资派的反，大造牛鬼蛇神的反。他在牺牲的那天上午，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，一直在大街上书写毛主席语录。他在灭火中战斗到最后一息，还威武不屈地站着，手中紧握半截锨柄，好象要向前冲去。
    杨青云是位民办小学女教师。她平时省吃俭用，把国家补助的生活费节约下来，给贫下中农的孩子们买毛主席著作。她用的镜子已经十年了，模糊不清，别人劝她再买个新的。她说：“照脸镜子的好坏，对我来说没有什么。但毛泽东思想这面镜子不能没有，它可以照出灵魂深处的灰尘，能使我改造好世界观。”她穿的棉袄已经十年了，根本看不出原来是什么颜色。有人说：“青云呀！你那么大的姑娘了，咋不做件花袄穿？”她说：“棉袄褪了颜色一样能够遮寒，人的思想离开了毛泽东思想，咱们国家就要改变颜色。”她在日记本上写了这样的誓言：“为人民的利益，上刀山，闯火海，粉身碎骨，永不变心。”她在扑灭山火战斗中完完全全履行了她向毛主席立下的钢铁誓言。
    孟麦娥虽然才十四岁，可是战无不胜的毛泽东思想把她哺育成意志刚强的姑娘。她只上了三年学，打开《毛主席语录》，生字一大堆。她狠学狠用，把《毛主席语录》中许多警句都铭刻在心中。她十三岁的那年秋天，勇敢地顶替妇女队长的职务，带领妇女们出色地完成三秋任务。社员都说她是块好钢。在扑灭山火的战斗中，她打火的扫帚烧了，就用石头砸火，用双脚踏火。直到烈火夺去她年轻的生命时，她手里还紧紧攥着一块没来得及掷出去的打火的石头。
    这些同志为人民的利益英勇地牺牲了。他们活学活用毛泽东思想和英勇扑灭山火的先进事迹，使人们永远不能忘记，成为人们学习的好榜样。
