The Indonesian people, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, have ignited the flames of revolutionary armed struggle. In West Kalimantan, East Java, Central Java, and North Sumatra, the people's armed forces have repeatedly smashed the "encirclement and suppression" tactics of the Indonesian reactionary army and achieved continuous victories. We warmly celebrate the development of the Indonesian people's revolutionary armed struggle.

Our great teacher, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "The oppressed people's struggle for complete liberation is primarily dependent on their own struggle." Chairman Mao also points out: "We are not isolated; all countries and peoples in the world who oppose imperialism are our friends. However, we emphasize self-reliance; we can rely on our own organized forces to defeat all domestic and foreign reactionaries."

This is a great truth. The victories of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries are all primarily dependent on their own strength, on mobilizing the broad masses of revolutionaries, and on taking the path of self-reliance. The victory of the Chinese revolution is like this, and the victory of the Indonesian people's revolutionary struggle will inevitably be the same. There is no doubt that the Indonesian people's revolutionary struggle has the sympathy and support of the revolutionary peoples of the whole world. However, fundamentally, only by mobilizing the broadest and most extensive masses, especially the peasant masses, establishing rural revolutionary bases, and persisting in long-term armed struggle, can the victory of the revolutionary struggle be achieved.

The Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian revolutionary people have now begun to shift their work focus to the countryside and to armed struggle. Their foothold has been placed on deepening work in the countryside, mobilizing the peasants, relying on the peasants, and arming the peasants, on creating conditions to establish rural revolutionary bases. This is a major transformation and is a reliable guarantee that the Indonesian people's revolutionary struggle can be sustained and achieve complete victory.

In the past year, the Indonesian Communist Party and Indonesian revolutionaries have actively mobilized the peasant masses in some rural areas to carry out the elimination of traitors and landlords and land revolution. Thus, in these rural areas, they have struck at the landlord class and feudal forces, making it possible for impoverished peasants to be liberated from reactionary rule and actively support, aid, and participate in the revolutionary armed struggle. According to the disclosure of Indonesian reactionary newspapers, on November 12 of last year, in a certain place in Indonesia, there were 1,000 peasants who joined the revolutionary armed forces. The facts prove that in the vast peasant masses of Indonesia, there is a tremendous revolutionary force, which, once awakened and organized, will erupt like a volcano.

At present, the Indonesian revolutionary situation is very good and will inevitably become better. People's armed forces have already been established in some regions and are rapidly developing and growing. Especially in West Kalimantan, in many rural areas, people's guerrilla units and work teams have been formed everywhere, carrying out activities to eliminate traitors, eliminate landlords, and mobilize peasants. In mid-February of this year, more than 300 Indonesian military and police in East Java staged an armed uprising and joined the people's armed forces. In regions like West Kalimantan, revolutionary bases are being formed. The grand curtain of the Indonesian people's revolutionary war has been raised.

The Indonesian revolutionary people understand that the Indonesian revolutionary armed struggle will be long-term, complex, and arduous. To achieve final victory, it is necessary to resolutely mobilize the masses and rely on the masses. With the masses, especially with the support and conscious active participation of the peasant masses, the revolutionary armed struggle can be sustained under any difficulties; revolutionary forces can develop and grow from small to large, from weak to strong, and ultimately defeat any enemy.

Revolutionary people do not have guns, so they seize them from the enemy. The arms factories of the United States, Britain, Japan, and the Soviet revisionists can all become sources of weapons for the Indonesian people's armed forces. Suharto, Nasution, and the like can serve as the transport commanders for delivering weapons to the people's armed forces. According to the disclosure of the Indonesian reactionary newspaper "Military News," the Indonesian people's armed forces once raided the Tanjung Priok airport and seized hundreds of boxes of guns and ammunition. If there is no food, they will open up wasteland to produce it. To break the enemy's economic blockade, the people's armed forces open up wasteland to grow crops. In the Ngilang region alone, 15 hectares of land have been reclaimed. If they do not know how to fight, they learn from fighting. The Indonesian people's armed forces are thus constantly striking the enemy, constantly accumulating revolutionary forces, and constantly developing and growing themselves.

The victorious development of the Indonesian people's revolutionary armed struggle is a victory of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought combined with Indonesian revolutionary practice. It sets another good example for the struggles of oppressed nations and peoples around the world to achieve liberation.

　　印尼人民燃起了革命武装斗争的烈火

    印尼人民在印尼共产党的领导下，燃起了革命武装斗争的熊熊烈火。在印尼的西加里曼丹、东爪哇、中爪哇和苏门答腊北部等地的人民武装，不断粉碎印尼反动军队的“围剿”，连续获得胜利。我们热烈欢呼印尼人民革命武装斗争的胜利发展。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席教导说：“被压迫人民争取彻底的解放，首先是依靠自己的斗争”。毛主席又指出：“我们并不孤立，全世界一切反对帝国主义的国家和人民都是我们的朋友。但是我们强调自力更生，我们能够依靠自己组织的力量，打败一切中外反动派。”
    这是一个伟大的真理。各国人民革命斗争的胜利，都是主要依靠自己的力量，依靠发动广大的革命群众，走自力更生的道路。中国革命的胜利是这样，印尼人民革命斗争的胜利也必然是这样。毫无疑问，印尼人民的革命斗争，有着全世界革命人民的同情和支援。但是，归根结底，只有最广泛、最充分地发动群众，特别是农民群众，建立农村的革命根据地，坚持长期的武装斗争，才能够取得革命斗争的胜利。
    印尼共产党和印尼革命人民，现在已经开始把工作重心转移到农村，转移到武装斗争方面。他们的立足点已经放在深入农村，发动农民，依靠农民，武装农民上面，放在创造条件，建立农村革命根据地的上面。这是一个重大的转变，是印尼人民的革命斗争能够坚持下去，能够取得彻底胜利的可靠的保证。
    近一年来，印尼共产党和印尼革命者在一些农村地区积极地发动农民群众，进行除奸灭霸和土地革命。这样，就在这些农村地区打击了地主阶级和封建势力，也就有可能使贫苦农民从反动统治下解放出来，积极拥护、支援和参加革命武装斗争。据印尼反动报刊透露，去年十一月十二日这一天，在印尼某地就有农民一千人参加革命武装。事实证明，在印尼广大的农民群众中，蕴藏着巨大的革命力量，它一旦被唤醒并组织起来，就会象火山一样地爆发。
    当前，印尼革命形势好得很，而且必然会越来越好。人民武装力量已经在一些地区建立了起来，并且正在迅速发展壮大。尤其是在西加里曼丹，在不少农村地区，纷纷组成了人民游击队和武工队，到处开展锄奸、除霸，发动农民的活动。今年二月中旬，东爪哇三百多名印尼军警举行武装起义，投奔人民武装力量。象在西加里曼丹这样的地区，正在形成革命的根据地。印尼人民革命战争的伟大的序幕已经揭开了。
    印尼革命人民懂得，印尼的革命武装斗争将是长期的、复杂的、艰巨的，要使斗争取得最后胜利，就必须坚决地发动群众，依靠群众。有了群众，特别是有了农民群众的支援和自觉的积极的参加，革命的武装斗争就能够在任何艰难困苦的情况下，坚持下去；革命力量就能够由小到大，由弱到强地发展壮大，最后战胜任何强敌。
    革命人民没有枪，就到敌人那里去夺取。美国、英国、日本和苏修集团的兵工厂，都可以成为印尼人民武装的武器来源，苏哈托、纳苏蒂安之流，可以充当给人民武装运送武器的运输大队长。据印尼反动报纸《武装部队报》透露，印尼人民武装曾经袭击了山口洋机场，一下子就缴获了几百箱枪支和弹药。没有粮，就自己开荒生产。为了粉碎敌人的经济封锁，人民武装自己开荒种庄稼，仅在恩吉卢地区，就开垦了十五公顷土地。不会打仗，就从战争中学习战争。印尼人民武装，就是这样不断地打击敌人，不断地积蓄革命力量，不断地发展壮大自己。
    印尼人民革命武装斗争的胜利发展，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同印尼革命实践相结合的胜利，它为世界上被压迫民族和被压迫人民争取解放的斗争，树立了又一个很好的榜样。
