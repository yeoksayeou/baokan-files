The coal gas station of the First Automobile Works in Changchun is a large coal gas production plant, with all its equipment imported from abroad. When the equipment was being installed, a "gas expert" from the foreign factory that produced the equipment was sent over. This "expert" boasted about how "advanced" their foreign equipment was and compiled a set of operating procedures that were about a foot and a half thick. According to the regulations of this "foreign procedure," once the equipment starts, regardless of whether you need coal gas or not, it must keep producing. Otherwise, an explosion would occur. However, the factory used very little or no coal gas at night and during off-days. At this time, the produced coal gas had to be released into the air and burned away, wasting a large amount of high-quality coal every day.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Embezzlement and waste are grave crimes." The revolutionary workers at the coal gas station saw the state's precious coal being burned away and the coal gas being wasted, and their hearts ached. They proposed several times to reform the "foreign procedure" to eliminate this shocking waste. However, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the factory and some reactionary technical "authorities" treasured the foreign framework as if it were a treasure. They mimicked China's Khrushchev's slavish attitude of "completely copying foreign experience" and said nonsense like, "It's already good enough to fully learn from others; don't even think about innovating before you've learned it all." On one hand, they used the foreign "expert's" "foreign procedure" to intimidate the workers, saying that anyone who violated this "foreign procedure" would be criticized, have their wages docked, or even be disciplined or fired. On the other hand, they promoted material incentives, giving bonuses to workers who obediently followed the "foreign procedure." Thus, the revolutionary workers' several proposals for technological innovation were suppressed by their soft and hard tactics.

During the great proletarian cultural revolution, the proletarian revolutionary faction seized power from the small clique of capitalist roaders within the party. Subsequently, with the help of the People's Liberation Army propaganda team stationed at the plant, they launched a revolutionary criticism campaign, focusing on criticizing the revisionist line that China's Khrushchev promoted on the industrial front. Old worker Jiang Rongchang, who had previously proposed reforming the "foreign procedure," through the revolutionary criticism, realized that their innovation proposals were suppressed because a small clique of capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities" hidden within the party were making trouble. He gathered a few old workers, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, and his great teachings on self-reliance and hard struggle. They further realized that those people did not allow workers to innovate to suppress the workers' revolutionary spirit of rebellion; promoting material incentives was to corrupt the workers' revolutionary will, making them obedient "tools," so that they could brazenly promote the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and turn socialist enterprises into capitalist enterprises. Jiang Rongchang excitedly said: "Previously, we felt sorry for the state's property and proposed innovation. Now it seems that opposing the 'foreign procedure' is not just about saving resources; it is a major issue of which path our coal gas station should take." They discussed all night and the next day proposed to all the revolutionary workers at the station the initiative to overthrow the "foreign procedure." This initiative immediately received a warm response from the revolutionary workers.

During the study of the innovation plan, some technical personnel emphasized more on the technical aspects: they thought that the oxygen content, coal gas backflow, and accumulation of coal tar were difficult to control; some even said: "If any one of these is not controlled, a catastrophic explosion will occur."

Facing these difficulties, the revolutionary workers studied Chairman Mao's teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work" and realized that any reform must not be separated from the line of class struggle and line struggle. They studied Chairman Mao's works on one hand and criticized the revisionist "foreign procedure" on the other. Old worker Ma Chengli said: "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Among all things in the world, man is the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle in the world can be created.' But the essence of the 'foreign procedure' is to see things but not people, which directly contradicts Mao Zedong Thought." Through the revolutionary criticism, everyone clarified the guiding ideology of reforming the "foreign procedure," which was to emphasize proletarian politics and emphasize the human factor, to always follow Chairman Mao's teachings, to despise difficulties strategically and to take difficulties seriously tactically, and to boldly and meticulously carry out this technological innovation.

The innovation at the coal gas station experienced one arduous struggle after another. Revolutionary workers fought not only against the revisionist "foreign procedure" but also against the "selfishness" in their own minds. They insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, turning every struggle into a classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, making the entire innovation process a battlefield for criticizing selfishness and revisionism.

One day, during the trial, suddenly, the bottom of the coal gas generator showed signs of explosion, which was a sign of a major explosion. The atmosphere became tense. The young furnace worker in charge of this trial, Zhao Chuangong, had a thought: in the past, even starting one furnace required the presence of the factory director and engineers to take responsibility. Now the responsibility falls on my shoulders. What if something goes wrong? At this moment, he heard Chairman Mao's voice: "Our responsibility is to the people." He thought, I should now consider how to overcome difficulties and ensure the smooth progress of the innovation trial. This is the true attitude of being responsible to the people. So, he raised the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and loudly recited to all the workers: "Resolve to struggle against all difficulties, and strive for victory." He remained at his post, calmly directing everyone to fight.

The leader of the coal gas station, Zhuo Cuilun, who participated in the innovation trial with the workers, had made some mistakes in the past. Seeing the signs of danger, he became worried again, fearing that he would make more mistakes. This thought flashed through his mind, and he immediately realized that this was putting himself first in the face of a situation, which did not conform to Chairman Mao's teachings. So, he calmly helped the workers analyze the cause and adjusted the machine, finally eliminating the danger.

Just as one difficulty was overcome, another danger followed. The second coal gas delivery machine was blocked by coal tar. The coal gas delivery machine is the key to the coal gas station. If it stops, all the equipment will stop, and the innovation trial will have to be redone. Therefore, this fault must be eliminated immediately. However, entering the equipment filled with coal gas to work is very dangerous. At this time, only the old worker and Communist Party member Yang Tianming firmly said: "To struggle is to have sacrifices. For the success of the innovation and to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, any sacrifice is not to be feared." After saying this, he took his tools and went into the equipment, finally found the cause, eliminated the fault, and the equipment resumed normal operation, ensuring the smooth progress of the trial.

The innovation was successful! The "foreign equipment" under the operation of revolutionary workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought operated normally according to the new process, producing as much coal gas as needed. The workers deeply felt: "People listen to Chairman Mao's words, and the machine listens to people's words." This technological innovation has saved the country more than a thousand tons of high-quality coal and more than eighty thousand degrees of electricity in the two months since its success.

    政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线
    ——记长春第一汽车制造厂煤气站在革命大批判中实现的一次重大技术革新
    长春第一汽车制造厂的煤气站，是个大型煤气发生站，设备都是从外国买来的。在安装的时候，出产那套设备的外国某工厂派来了一个煤气“专家”。那个“专家”大肆吹嘘他们的洋设备如何如何“先进”，并编写了一套足有一尺半厚的“操作规程”。按那个“洋规程”的规定：只要设备一启动，不管你用不用煤气，都得一股劲地生产，否则，就会发生爆炸。但是，工厂在夜间和休班的时候，煤气用得很少或根本不用。这时，生产出来的煤气只好放到空中白白地烧掉，每天要浪费大量的优质煤。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“贪污和浪费是极大的犯罪”。煤气站的革命工人，看到国家大量的好煤白白地被烧掉，煤气白白地被浪费，心疼极了，几次提出要改革“洋规程”，杜绝这种惊人的浪费现象。可是，厂内一小撮走资派和一些反动技术“权威”，把洋框框当成宝贝，学着中国赫鲁晓夫“要全盘照搬外国经验”的奴隶主义腔调，胡说什么“全面学好人家的东西就不错了，不要学都没学好就想跑。”他们一方面把外国“专家”那本“洋规程”抬出来吓唬工人，气势汹汹地说，谁要是违反这个“洋规程”，轻则批评、扣工资，重则处分、开除；另一方面，大搞物质刺激，只要工人俯首帖耳地遵守“洋规程”，就给奖金。这样，革命工人的几次技术革新倡议，都被他们用软硬兼施的手段扼杀了。
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级革命派夺了党内一小撮走资派的权。接着，他们在驻站解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，开展了革命大批判，着重批判了中国赫鲁晓夫在工业战线上推行的修正主义路线。曾经提出改革“洋规程”建议的老工人姜荣昌，通过革命大批判，认识到以前他们的革新建议受到压制，是一小撮隐藏在党内的走资派和反动技术“权威”捣的鬼。他找到几个老工人，一起学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，关于自力更生、艰苦奋斗的伟大教导，进一步认识到：那些家伙不准工人革新，是为了压制工人的革命造反精神；搞物质刺激，是为了腐蚀工人的革命意志，让工人乖乖地作他们的“驯服工具”，以便他们肆无忌惮地推行反革命修正主义路线，把社会主义企业变成资本主义企业。姜荣昌激动地说：“以前我们心疼国家的财产，提出了革新建议。现在看起来，造‘洋规程’的反，不光是为了节约，还是我们煤气站走什么道路的大问题。”他们合计了一夜，第二天就向全站革命职工提出了革“洋规程”命的倡议。这个倡议立即得到了广大革命职工的热烈响应。
    在研究革新方案的时候，有些技术人员比较着重于从技术上看问题：他们认为氧气含量，煤气倒流，煤焦油的堆积都难以控制；有的甚至说：“如果其中一项控制不住，就会发生不堪设想的大爆炸。”
    面对着这些难题，革命工人们学习了毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，认识到，进行任何改革都不能脱离阶级斗争和路线斗争这条纲。他们一面学习毛主席著作，一面批判修正主义的“洋规程”。老工人马成礼说：“毛主席教导我们：‘世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来’。可是‘洋规程’的要害就是见物不见人，这是直接违反毛泽东思想的。”通过革命大批判，大家明确了改革“洋规程”的指导思想，就是一定要突出无产阶级政治，突出人的因素，要时时遵照毛主席教导，在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难，大胆而又细致地把这项技术革新搞好。
    煤气站的革新经历了一次又一次的艰苦斗争。革命工人同修正主义“洋规程”斗，也同自己头脑中的“私”字斗。他们坚持活学活用毛主席著作，把每一次斗争都当作活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂，使整个革新过程成为一个斗私批修的战场。
    一天，试验正在进行，突然，煤气发生炉底出现了爆喷，这是要发生大爆炸的征兆。空气顿时紧张起来。负责这次试验的青年炉工赵传功头脑里闪过一个念头：过去，连启动一台炉子都有厂长、工程师到场负责，现在责任落在自己的肩上，万一有了差错怎么办？这时他耳边响起了毛主席的声音：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。”他想，我现在应该考虑如何克服困难，保证革新试验的顺利进行，这才是真正向人民负责的态度。于是，他举起《毛主席语录》，向全体职工高声朗诵：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他始终坚守在岗位上，沉着地指挥大家战斗。
    同工人一起进行革新试验的煤气站领导干部邹萃伦，曾经犯过一些错误，这时看到危险的征兆，又担心起来，怕再捅漏子，旧错加新错。这个念头一闪现，他马上想到这是一事当前，先替自己打算，不符合毛主席教导。于是，他冷静地帮助工人分析原因，调整机器，终于排除了危险。
    一个难关刚刚闯过，又一个险情接踵而来。二号煤气排送机被煤焦油堵塞了。煤气排送机是煤气站的关键，它一停，全部设备都得停，革新试验就要返工，因此，这个故障必须马上排除。但是，要进入充满煤气的设备里去作业是十分危险的。这时，只见老工人、共产党员杨天明坚定地说：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，为了革新的成功，为了捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，任何牺牲也不怕。”他说完就拿起工具进到设备里去，终于查清了原因，排除了故障，设备又恢复了正常运转，保证了试验顺利地进行。
    革新胜利了！“洋设备”在用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命工人操纵下，按照新工艺正常运转着，要它生产多少煤气，它就生产多少煤气。工人们深有感触地说：“人听毛主席的话，机器就听人的话。”这项技术革新成功两个月来，煤气站就为国家节约了一千多吨优质煤和八万多度电。
