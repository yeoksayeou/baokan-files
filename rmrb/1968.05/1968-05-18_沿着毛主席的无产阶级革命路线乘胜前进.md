The magnificent document of Marxism-Leninism personally drafted by our great leader Chairman Mao—the May 16 Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966—has been published for two years. On this great day, the three million seven hundred thousand heroic sons and daughters of the Zunyi region, who are forever loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, are filled with revolutionary passion and wish Chairman Mao a long, long life! A long, long life!

Over the past two years, the proletarian revolutionary forces of the Zunyi region have taken this epoch-making document as their guiding light and, in the unprecedented, magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have closely followed the great commander Chairman Mao from victory to victory.

The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years has made us deeply understand a truth: following Chairman Mao means victory!

Turning the pages of the history of the Chinese people's revolution, which page does not shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought? Reviewing the course of the Chinese revolution, which stage has not achieved victory under Chairman Mao's leadership? At any time, as long as we follow Chairman Mao and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the revolution will develop and advance. Conversely, the revolution will suffer setbacks, and the revolutionary cause will be damaged.

The red sun rises over the city of Zunyi, illuminating the nine heavens. The Chinese revolution has gone through many twists and turns and struggles, finally ending the rule of the "left" and right opportunist lines at the Zunyi Conference in January 1935, and establishing the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao over the entire Party and the entire army. From then on, under the guidance of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, the Chinese revolution has dispelled the fog, straightened the course, sailed against the wind and waves, and advanced to victory!

After the revolution achieved nationwide victory and we established a proletarian dictatorship, class struggle did not end. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, have been stirring up trouble, attempting to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism. As Chairman Mao taught us in the Notification: "Those in the Party, government, army, and various cultural circles who are in fact representatives of the bourgeoisie and have sneaked into the Party, government, army, and various cultural circles are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie."

The agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in Guizhou and the Zunyi region have been rampantly opposing Mao Zedong Thought in recent years, vigorously opposing the prominence of proletarian politics, and promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. They have formed cliques, recruited traitors, and gathered a handful of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries to engage in conspiratorial sabotage activities, attempting to restore capitalism in Guizhou and the Zunyi region.

Just as this handful of enemies of the proletariat were dreaming of overthrowing the proletarian dictatorship, it was our great helmsman Chairman Mao who timely exposed their plots and personally launched the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This great revolution is not only a great new chapter in the history of the Chinese revolution but also opens a new page in the development of the international communist movement.

The broad proletarian revolutionary forces of the Zunyi region, following the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, have raised high the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," maintained and carried forward the glorious tradition of the Zunyi Conference spirit, inherited the revolutionary spirit of "The Red Army is not afraid of the difficulties of a long march," and launched a massive struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in Guizhou and the Zunyi region. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the proletarian revolutionary forces of the Zunyi region, with the strong support of the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Zunyi, seized the party, government, financial, and cultural powers from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in February 1967 and established the new revolutionary government—the Zunyi Regional Revolutionary Committee.

After the proletarian revolutionary forces took power, they closely followed the great leader Chairman Mao, always and in everything grasped the fundamentals, and put the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in the forefront of all work. In the glorious city of Zunyi, along the banks of the Wujiang River, on the mountains of Luoshan Pass, and in the valleys and mountains of the Qingshui River, everywhere you hear the sound of reading Chairman Mao's books and singing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations. Chairman Mao's latest instructions are disseminated to the masses, and the entire region has launched a wave of earnest implementation and comprehensive realization. The circulation of Chairman Mao's brilliant works in our region has increased by tens of thousands of times compared to the past. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, with more than five hundred thousand now in operation, involving more than two million one hundred thousand participants. The broad revolutionary masses are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the study classes, they study and apply Chairman Mao's works, carry out self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, promote the great criticism throughout the region, consolidate and develop the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the revolution, and advance the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various units. By mid-March of this year, revolutionary committees at all levels above the commune had been universally established, achieving a red tide throughout the region. The spiritual face of the masses has undergone significant changes. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," the entire region's industrial and agricultural fronts have presented a prosperous scene. Our Zunyi region, like the rest of the country, has a great situation that is getting better and better.

To develop this great situation and carry the revolution through to the end, the broad proletarian revolutionary forces of the Zunyi region are determined to closely follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, grasp the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, carry forward the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution, and advance in victory. We will use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as our weapon, resolutely oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, and thoroughly smash the right opportunist wind of reversal. We must prevent the slackening of fighting spirit and stagnation. We must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and correctly distinguish between the two types of contradictions. With class struggle and line struggle as the key, we will carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, thoroughly eliminate all the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and root out all hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries.

On the occasion of the second anniversary of the publication of the Notification, we swear: Even if the sea dries up and the stones crumble, our red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao will never change! We will "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," and vow to turn our region into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, letting the spirit of the Zunyi Conference shine forever! Let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high forever!

    沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线乘胜前进
    贵州省遵义地区革命委员会
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的光辉的马克思列宁主义的历史文件——中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》，发表已经两周年了。在这个伟大的日子里，永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席的遵义地区三百七十多万英雄儿女，满怀革命激情，千遍万遍地祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    两年来，遵义地区的无产阶级革命派，以这个划时代的文献为指路明灯，在史无前例的波澜壮阔的无产阶级文化大革命中，紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，从胜利走向胜利。
    两年来无产阶级文化大革命的实践，使我们深刻地认识了一条真理：跟着毛主席，就是胜利！
    翻开中国人民的革命史册，那一页不是闪烁着毛泽东思想的光芒；回顾中国革命的战斗历程，那一程不是在毛主席指引下取得了胜利。不论在什么时候，只要紧跟毛主席，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，革命就会发展，就会前进。反之，革命就要遭受挫折，革命事业就会受到损失。
    遵义城头霞光闪，一轮红日照九天。中国革命经过多少反复、曲折的斗争，终于在一九三五年一月的遵义会议上，结束了“左”、右倾机会主义路线的统治，确立了伟大领袖毛主席在全党全军的领导地位。从此，中国革命在伟大舵手毛主席的指引下，驱散迷雾，拨正船头，乘风破浪，胜利前进！
    在革命取得全国胜利，在我们建立起无产阶级专政的国家以后，阶级斗争并没有结束。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派还在兴风作浪，妄图颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。正如毛主席在《通知》中教导我们的：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫在贵州和遵义地区的代理人，这些年来猖狂地反对毛泽东思想，极力反对突出无产阶级政治，推行反革命修正主义路线。他们结党营私，招降纳叛，网罗了一小撮叛徒、特务、反革命分子，进行阴谋破坏活动，妄图在贵州和遵义地区复辟资本主义。
    正当这一小撮无产阶级的敌人大作颠覆无产阶级专政的迷梦的时候，又是我们伟大舵手毛主席及时识破了他们的阴谋，亲自发动了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。这场大革命，不仅是中国革命史上伟大的新篇章，而且在国际共产主义运动发展史上开创了崭新的一页。
    遵义地区的广大无产阶级革命派，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，保持和发扬遵义会议精神的光荣传统，继承了“红军不怕远征难”的革命精神，大造了党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在贵州和遵义地区的代理人的反。在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，遵义地区无产阶级革命派在人民解放军驻遵义部队广大指战员的大力支持下，于一九六七年二月从党内一小撮走资派手中夺回了党政财文大权，建立了新生的革命政权——遵义地区革命委员会。
    无产阶级革命派掌权以后，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，时时、事事狠抓根本，把活学活用、学好用好毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位。在光荣的遵义城，在英雄的乌江两岸，在娄山关的山上山下，在赤水河的河谷山川，到处是一片读毛主席的书，唱毛主席语录歌的声音。毛主席的各项最新指示一同广大群众见面，全区就掀起认真贯彻和全面落实的热潮。毛主席的光辉著作在我区的发行量，比过去成万倍地增加。各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，如雨后春笋般地发展起来，现在已有五万多处，参加学习的达二百一十多万人。广大革命群众无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在学习班里活学活用毛主席著作，开展斗私、批修，推进了全区革命的大批判，巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，促进了各单位的斗批改。今年三月中旬，公社以上的各级革命委员会就普遍建立起来，实现了全区上下一片红。广大群众的精神面貌发生了显著变化。在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针指引下，全区工农业战线出现了一片兴旺景象。我们遵义地区和全国一样，形势一片大好，越来越好。
    为了发展大好形势，将革命进行到底，遵义地区广大无产阶级革命派，决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，发扬无产阶级彻底革命的精神，乘胜前进。我们要以毛主席的最新指示为武器，坚决地反对右倾机会主义，反对右倾分裂主义，反对右倾投降主义，彻底粉碎右倾翻案妖风。一定要严防斗志松懈、停滞不前的情绪。要牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，正确区分两类不同性质的矛盾。以阶级斗争和路线斗争为纲，深入持久地开展革命大批判，彻底肃清反革命修正主义路线的一切流毒，把隐藏的叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子统统挖出来。
    在纪念《通知》发表两周年的日子里，我们宣誓：海枯石烂，忠于毛主席的红心永不变！我们要“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，誓把我区办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，让遵义会议精神代代相传，永放光芒！让毛泽东思想伟大红旗高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
