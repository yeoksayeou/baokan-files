The great victory of the Cultural Revolution inspires revolutionary peoples of all countries to fight against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries

According to Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, May 22: Sri Lankan friends recently told Xinhua News Agency reporters that the "May 16 Circular" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966, personally directed by Comrade Mao Zedong, creatively developed Marxism-Leninism and solved the problem of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is a brilliant, epoch-making document of Marxism-Leninism.

Sri Lankan parliamentarian S. D. Bandaranaike said that Comrade Mao Zedong has correctly solved the problem of continuing the revolution and preventing capitalist restoration under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat in theory and practice.

Bandaranaike hailed the great victories achieved by the Chinese Cultural Revolution in the past two years. He said that this great revolution will ensure that China will never change color. This is the greatest contribution Comrade Mao Zedong has made to the proletariat of the whole world.

Sri Lankan journalist Ranasinghe pointed out that the "May 16 Circular" is a document of great historical significance in Marxism-Leninism. It teaches all Marxist-Leninists in the world how to launch and carry out revolutionary struggles under the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent capitalist restoration. All Marxist-Leninists should study the "May 16 Circular" thoroughly and grasp its spirit and essence.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, May 21: On the second anniversary of the issuance of the "May 16 Circular" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966, Pakistani friends warmly praised the brilliant victories of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, which has greatly inspired the revolutionary peoples of the world.

A committee member of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee in Rawalpindi pointed out that the Chinese Cultural Revolution has added strength to the struggle of the revolutionary peoples of the world against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. Under the inspiration of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, the armed struggle of the Asian, African, and Latin American peoples against imperialist rule and aggression has flourished; the struggle of the oppressed classes in Western capitalist countries against oppression and exploitation has reached an unprecedented scale; the heroic struggle of American blacks has dealt a heavy blow to the decaying American imperialism.

A friend from the news media said that the great victory of the Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, marks a great and important development in Marxism-Leninism regarding the prevention of capitalist restoration under socialist conditions.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, May 20: Nepalese friends warmly hail the great victories achieved by the Chinese Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao.

Two Nepalese friends in a joint statement to Xinhua News Agency's Kathmandu branch said: In response to the call of the great leader of the Chinese people and the great teacher of the peoples of the world, Chairman Mao, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people in China have timely overthrown a handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road. This is a victory for the Chinese people, a victory for Mao Zedong Thought, and a great victory for the proletariat of the whole world.

The statement enthusiastically hailed the great influence of Mao Zedong Thought in the world. The statement pointed out that the achievements of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, led by the great leader Chairman Mao, will inspire the peoples of all countries to achieve greater victories in their revolutionary struggles.

A friend named Joshi said: "The Cultural Revolution personally initiated by Chairman Mao has great international significance." This great revolution has smashed the vicious plots of traitors to the proletarian revolutionary cause such as China's Khrushchev, giving great encouragement and support to the struggle of all revolutionary peoples in the world against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, and strengthening the revolutionary spirit of the peoples of the world.
