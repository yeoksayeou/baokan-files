Sri Lankan progressives warmly acclaim the issuance of the May 16 Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, on its second anniversary.

The secretary-general of the Sri Lanka-China Friendship Association, Ananda Kumara, said in a written statement to Xinhua News Agency on May 16 that the greatest revolutionary leader of our time, Mao Zedong, has brilliantly summarized the historical experiences of the international communist movement, pointing the way to victory for the revolutionary people.

He said that this Notification has passed a death sentence on all kinds of modern revisionists who are trying every means to restore capitalism. The modern revisionist ghosts and snakes will inevitably be exposed by the sharp eyes of revolutionaries armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong.

He said that the Notification will be recorded in the annals of the workers' movement as a great document with profound revolutionary truths.

Some Sri Lankan friends who study Chairman Mao's works together issued a statement to Xinhua News Agency on May 17, saying that the Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is a revolutionary document of great historical significance.

The statement said that the Notification smashed the conspiracy of a small clique of those in power within the Party who were taking the capitalist road. They attempted to restore capitalism, oppose the proletariat, oppose Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and try to change the direction of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the whole world, leading them onto the capitalist road taken by the Soviet revisionists who have become lackeys of imperialism. The Notification, drafted under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, has delivered a decisive and fatal blow to the bourgeois revisionists and counter-revolutionaries.

The statement said, "Let us march forward on the revolutionary path illuminated by Mao Zedong Thought. Let us learn from the victorious struggle of the Communist Party of China against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. Let us, the proletariat of Asia, arm ourselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely eliminate the reactionary rule of the bourgeoisie."

Xinhua News Agency, Mogadishu, May 17: The Somali Writers' Association issued an article on May 16, enthusiastically acclaiming the second anniversary of the issuance of the epoch-making Marxist-Leninist document, the May 16 Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

The article enthusiastically acclaims the great victories achieved by the revolutionary masses of the Chinese proletariat under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought in the past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The article points out that Chairman Mao said: "After the enemies with guns have been wiped out, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies." In a socialist society, class struggle still exists, and it is particularly sharp and complex on the political and ideological fronts. Therefore, it is necessary to spread Mao Zedong Thought among the people and educate them in socialism and communism, so that they can break away from the influence of reactionary bourgeois ideology and realize the importance of carrying the revolution through to the end to achieve communism.

The article points out that it is under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought that the revolutionary workers, peasants, and intellectuals in China have smashed the conspiracy of the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party, represented by the Chinese Khrushchev, and achieved great victories.

The article said that the Somali people warmly congratulate the great victories achieved by the broad revolutionary masses of China in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and wish them continued progress in consolidating their socialist state of proletarian dictatorship. Their great achievements have powerfully promoted the new development of the world people's revolution.

The article concludes: "Long live the thought of Mao Zedong, the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world!"

    索马里作家协会指出中国文化大革命有力地促进了世界革命新发展
    新华社科伦坡十七日电　锡兰进步人士热烈欢呼在毛主席亲自主持下制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》发表两周年。
    锡中友好协会秘书长阿南达·库马拉十六日在这里向新华社记者发表书面谈话指出，当代最伟大的革命领袖毛泽东天才地总结了国际共产主义运动的历史经验，为革命人民指出了走向胜利的道路。
    他说，这个《通知》对那些千方百计企图复辟资本主义的形形色色的现代修正主义分子宣判了死刑。现代修正主义牛鬼蛇神，绝对逃不过用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的革命者的锐利目光。
    他说，《通知》将作为具有深刻革命真理的伟大文献载入工人阶级运动的史册。
    一些在一起学习毛主席著作的锡兰朋友十七日对新华社记者发表声明说，中共中央的《通知》是具有重大历史意义的革命文献。
    声明说，《通知》粉碎了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的阴谋，它们企图复辟资本主义，反对无产阶级，反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，妄图改变中国人民和全世界革命人民前进的方向，以便把他们引到已经成为帝国主义走狗的苏联修正主义者所走的资本主义道路上去。在伟大导师毛泽东主席主持下制定的《通知》，给了资产阶级修正主义分子和反革命分子决定性的致命打击。
    声明说，让我们沿着毛泽东思想所照亮的革命道路迈进。让我们学习中国共产党反对帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的胜利斗争的经验，让我们亚洲无产阶级用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装自己，坚决地消灭资产阶级反动的统治制度。
    新华社摩加迪沙十七日电　索马里作家协会十六日发表一篇文章，热烈欢呼划时代的马克思列宁主义文献中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》发表两周年。
    文章热烈欢呼中国无产阶级革命派在光辉的毛泽东思想照耀下，在过去两年的无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的伟大胜利。
    文章指出，毛主席说：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”在社会主义社会里，仍然存在阶级斗争，在政治战线和思想战线方面，阶级斗争特别尖锐复杂。因此，必须在人民群众中间传播毛泽东思想，对他们进行社会主义和共产主义教育，使他们摆脱反动的资产阶级思想的影响，使他们认识到为了实现共产主义而把革命进行到底的重要性。
    文章指出，中国的革命工人、农民和革命知识分子正是在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，粉碎了以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的钻到党内的资产阶级代理人的阴谋，取得了伟大的胜利。
    文章说，索马里人民热烈祝贺中国广大革命人民群众在文化大革命中取得的伟大胜利，祝中国广大革命人民群众继续前进，巩固他们的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家。他们的丰功伟绩有力地促进了世界人民革命的新发展。
    文章最后写道：“全世界革命人民心中的红太阳毛泽东的思想万岁！”
