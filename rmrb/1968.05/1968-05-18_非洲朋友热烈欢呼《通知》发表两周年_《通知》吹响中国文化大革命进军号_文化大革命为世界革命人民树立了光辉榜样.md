African Friends Warmly Celebrate the Second Anniversary of the "Notice"

The "Notice" Sounds the Charge for the Chinese Cultural Revolution

The Cultural Revolution Sets a Brilliant Example for the World's Revolutionary People

According to Xinhua News Agency, Bamako, May 15th: On the second anniversary of the issuance of the May 16th Notice by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966, some friends in Mali here enthusiastically praised the great historical significance of this document and the great proletarian cultural revolution led by Chairman Mao.

A Malian worker said, "The great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao has set a brilliant example for the revolutionary people of the whole world. The current world revolutionary situation is excellent. The struggle of black people in the United States, the struggle of students and workers in Europe, and the struggle of the people of Asia and Africa for national liberation are all developing vigorously. This shows that the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has had a great impact on the world revolution."

A Malian friend who has long been studying the works of Chairman Mao said, "Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. He has developed the theory of proletarian revolution, pointing out that class and class struggle exist in socialist society. With great revolutionary courage and determination, Chairman Mao launched this Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, mobilizing the masses to expose and criticize the representatives of the bourgeoisie hiding within the party, and launched a struggle against the bourgeoisie. In this revolution, the political awareness of the masses has been rapidly raised, and a new generation of revolutionaries has been tempered and trained. This ensures that China will never change color."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 15th: A Botswanan friend spoke to a Xinhua News Agency correspondent here on the 15th, enthusiastically celebrating the second anniversary of the issuance of the great historical document, the May 16th Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966.

He said, "Two years ago, under the personal direction of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, this great Marxist-Leninist document was formulated, clearly proposing the theory, line, principles, and policies of the proletarian cultural revolution, and smashing the malicious plots of the Chinese Khrushchev and his clique to sabotage the proletarian cultural revolution and attempt to restore capitalism in China. This document sounded the advance signal for the proletarian cultural revolution."

He said, "Through the proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated by Chairman Mao, the oppressed people of the whole world have fully recognized that Chairman Mao Zedong is a great Marxist-Leninist of our time, and he has defended and developed Marxism-Leninism."

This African friend went on to point out that the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has made a great contribution to the common struggle of the peoples of various countries against imperialism and old and new colonialism and their lackeys. The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is a great encouragement to the revolutionary people of the world in their struggle against imperialism led by the United States and its accomplices.

He concluded with the slogans: "Long live the proletarian cultural revolution! Long live, ten thousand times long live, the great leader Chairman Mao!"

According to Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 16th: On the eve of the second anniversary of the issuance of the May 16th Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966, the acting representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa) in Cairo, Segedi, told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent that this great historical document marked the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the complete bankruptcy of the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev and his representatives.

Segedi visited China last May and personally witnessed the great achievements of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution. She said: "The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao made a deep impression on me. I visited many factories, people's communes, and universities. What moved me greatly was that through the proletarian cultural revolution, people's spiritual outlook has undergone great changes. The Chinese people love and are loyal to Chairman Mao without limit, and they make revolution according to Chairman Mao's teachings."

After strongly condemning and refuting the slander of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution by U.S.-led imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, Segedi pointed out that through the proletarian cultural revolution, China has become even stronger. There is no doubt that the great People's Republic of China is a reliable steel fortress for all oppressed peoples of the world. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the 700 million Chinese people will make greater contributions to the struggle of the world's revolutionary people.

    《通知》吹响中国文化大革命进军号
    文化大革命为世界革命人民树立了光辉榜样
    据新华社巴马科十五日电　在中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》发表两周年的时候，一些马里朋友在这里热烈赞扬这篇文献的伟大历史意义，赞扬毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    一位马里工人说，毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场大革命，为全世界革命人民树立了光辉的榜样。当前世界革命形势大好，美国黑人斗争、欧洲学生和工人的斗争、亚非人民争取民族解放的斗争正在蓬勃发展。这表明，中国的无产阶级文化大革命对世界革命给予了伟大影响。
    一位长期坚持学习毛主席著作的马里朋友说，毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。他发展了无产阶级革命的理论，指出了在社会主义社会中存在着阶级和阶级斗争。毛主席以伟大的革命胆略和决心发动了这场中国无产阶级文化大革命，动员人民群众起来揭发批判隐藏在党内的赫鲁晓夫式的资产阶级代表人物，向资产阶级展开了斗争。在这场革命中群众的政治觉悟得到迅速提高，并锻炼和培养了革命的新一代。这就保证了中国永远不会改变颜色。
    新华社开罗十五日电　一位博茨瓦纳朋友十五日在这里对新华社记者发表谈话，热烈欢呼伟大的历史文件中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》发表两周年。
    他说，两年前在伟大领袖毛泽东主席亲自主持下制定的这个伟大的马克思列宁主义文件，清楚地提出了无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其一伙破坏无产阶级文化大革命、妄图在中国复辟资本主义的恶毒阴谋。这个文件吹响了无产阶级文化大革命前进的号角。
    他说，通过毛主席亲自发动的无产阶级文化大革命，全世界被压迫人民充分认识到毛泽东主席是当代伟大的马克思列宁主义者，他捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义。
    这位非洲朋友接着指出，中国的无产阶级文化大革命对各国人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义及其一切走狗的共同斗争作出了巨大贡献。中国的无产阶级文化大革命是对反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其帮凶的全世界革命人民的巨大鼓舞。
    他最后高呼：“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    据新华社开罗十六日电　在中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》发表两周年前夕，阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会驻开罗代理代表赛格杰对新华社记者说，这个伟大的历史文件，标志着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，宣布了以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线的彻底破产。
    赛格杰去年五月曾来中国访问，亲眼看到了中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大成就。她说：“由毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命给了我深刻的印象。我参观过许多工厂、人民公社和大学。使我大为感动的是，通过无产阶级文化大革命，人们的精神面貌有了很大的改变。中国人民无限热爱和忠于毛主席，按照毛主席的教导闹革命。”
    赛格杰在强烈谴责和驳斥了以美国为首的帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义对中国无产阶级文化大革命的诬蔑之后指出，通过无产阶级文化大革命，中国变得更加强大了。毫无疑问，伟大的中华人民共和国是全世界一切被压迫人民的可靠的钢铁堡垒。七亿中国人民在毛泽东主席的领导下，将对世界革命人民的斗争作出更大的贡献。
