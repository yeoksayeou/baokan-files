	The Sun Shines on Kunlun,
	The Spring Thunder Rumbles,
	The Hero Stands Tall,
	The Victory Song Echoes Far.
	It sings of Comrade Menhe, a fine example,
	With a heart of loyalty and devotion to the red sun.

	He loves Chairman Mao the most,
	He respects Chairman Mao the most,
	He believes in Chairman Mao the most,
	He is loyal to Chairman Mao the most.

	(Spoken) Comrade Menhe is the most resolute executor, the most enthusiastic propagandist, and the most courageous defender of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. His ironclad vow is:
	Everything for Chairman Mao,
	Everything follows Chairman Mao,
	Everything keeps up with Chairman Mao,
	Everything is for Chairman Mao.

	His heart is clear with the direction of the rising sun,
	He remains calm amidst the flying clouds.

	Since Chairman Mao issued the order,
	"The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left",
	He acted swiftly to fight.

	He went to Baca Farm to support the left,
	And united with the revolutionary masses.

	With the masses, he read the Red Book together,
	With the masses, he sang "The East Is Red" together;
	With the masses, he discussed bitterness and sweetness,
	With the masses, he fought against selfishness and excavated the roots of revisionism;
	With the masses, he criticized and denounced the capitalist roaders,
	With the masses, he smashed the black wind;
	With the masses, he fought bravely on the battlefield,
	With the masses, he looked forward to a bountiful harvest.

	(Spoken) September on the plateau is the harvest season.
	The second harvest year brought by the Cultural Revolution is the result of implementing Chairman Mao's great call to "Seize the Revolution and Promote Production," and it is a symbol of the victory of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat.

	The Baca grassland shows a new look,
	Everyone is joyful.
	The drums and gongs celebrate victory,
	The songs echo the eastern wind.

	But the weather did not cooperate,
	Hailstorms brought disaster.
	For days, the military and civilians set up soil rockets,
	To drive away the clouds and prevent hail to protect the grain.

	On September 5th,
	The sky above the farm was dark and gloomy.
	The clouds were thick, and lightning flashed,
	The hail was even more ferocious.

	Menhe thought to himself:
	We must hurry to drive away the clouds and prevent hail.

	As he said, the anti-hail team set out,
	Menhe led the revolutionary masses,
	Reciting the quotations with great enthusiasm:
	"Be determined, do not be afraid of sacrifice,
	Overcome all difficulties,
	Strive for victory."

	The soldiers had the strength of a thousand jin,
	Their spirit to fight against the heavens and the earth was unyielding.
	They rushed to the setup site,
	Like charging onto the battlefield.

	Menhe was an old soldier,
	Shouldering heavy responsibilities without hesitation.
	He knew that setting up soil rockets was dangerous,
	And repeatedly reminded everyone:
	To be highly vigilant,
	And strictly follow the operating procedures.

	Filling the explosives was the most dangerous,
	Menhe took on the task himself.
	He said, "This danger, I will handle it!"
	Six bright characters.

	Six characters, each from the heart,
	Six characters, each like steel,
	Six characters, each beating the drum of progress,
	Six characters, each shining with loyalty.

	(Spoken) Soil rockets were set up one after another. Suddenly, the explosives next to Menhe caught fire, and the soil rockets that had just been set up were about to cause a chain reaction! The twenty-seven "August 18th" soldiers and revolutionary masses on the scene were about to face unimaginable consequences!

	In a critical moment, Menhe's heart was like the rising sun.
	Chairman Mao's teachings echoed in his ears:
	"To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai..."

	He bravely threw himself onto the explosives,
	Like capturing the enemy on the battlefield long ago.

	He was like Zhang Side in the coal mine,
	He was like Dong Cunrui blowing up the enemy fort,
	He was like Huang Jiguang blocking the gun port,
	He was like Wang Jie saving the people.

	A loud explosion was heard,
	His heroic spirit turned into thunder.
	Twenty-seven class brothers were saved,
	Menhe stood tall with a smile.

	(Spoken) Comrade Menhe, with his heart of loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, defended the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Listen! A song of Mao Zedong Thought echoes across the Qinghai Plateau, shaking the vast sky.

	Good Menhe, like an eagle soaring,
	Good Menhe, like a green pine towering into the clouds;
	Good Menhe, you sing a song with "loyalty,"
	Good Menhe, you forge a heart with "public spirit."

	We will hold high the flag you raised,
	We will hold high the lamp you held;
	We will forever walk the path you walked,
	We will learn from you to charge forward!

	Forever follow Chairman Mao,
	Our hearts will never change even if the sea dries up and the stones crumble.
	Completely bury the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries,
	Sweep away all harmful elements.
	Dare to change the heavens and the earth,
	Swear to make the whole world red!

    赤胆忠心向阳红（唱词）
    王佩琈
    一轮红日照昆仑，
    一声春雷山河动；
    一位英雄顶天立，
    一曲凯歌贯长虹。
    唱的是，门合同志好榜样，
    赤胆忠心向阳红。
    他对毛主席最热爱，
    他对毛主席最崇敬，
    他对毛主席最信仰，
    他对毛主席最忠诚。
      （白）门合同志，是毛主席革命路线最坚决的执行者，最热情的宣传者，最勇敢的捍卫者。他的钢铁誓言是：
    一切想着毛主席，
    一切服从毛主席，
    一切紧跟毛主席，
    一切为着毛主席。
    他胸有朝阳方向明，
    乱云飞渡仍从容。
    自从毛主席发出“人民解放
    军应该支持左派广大群
    众”的战斗令，
    他闻风而动去斗争。
    支左走进巴仓农场，
    和革命群众心连心。
    同群众，一起共读红宝书，
    同群众，一起高唱《东方红》；
    同群众，一起畅谈苦与甜，
    同群众，一起斗私挖修根；
    同群众，一起批臭走资派，
    同群众，一起打垮黑妖风；
    同群众，一起奋战斗天地，
    同群众，一起展望丰收景。
      （白）高原的九月，是丰收的季节。
    文化大革命带来的第二个丰收年，是贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大号召的结果，是无产阶级革命派胜利的象征。
    巴仓草原展新容，
    军民个个喜盈盈。
    阵阵锣鼓庆胜利，
    串串歌声壮东风。
    可就是老天不为人争气，
    冰雹袭击显凶情。
    连日来军民装置土火箭，
    驱云防雹把粮争。
    九月五日这一天，
    农场上空黑沉沉。
    阴云密布电光闪，
    冰雹来势更凶猛。
    门合看着心中想：
    驱云防雹要抓紧。
    说时迟来那时快，
    防雹队伍出了征。
    门合带领革命派，
    高诵语录吐豪情：
    “下定决心，不怕
      牺牲，排除万难，
      去争取胜利。”
    战士身有千钧力，
    斗天斗地志凌云。
    快步奔往装置场，
    就象战场打冲锋。
    门合是一位老战士，
    肩挑重担不让人。
    他懂得装置土火箭险情大，
    一再向大家细叮咛：
    要百倍提高警惕性，
    严格遵守操作规程。
    装填炸药最危险，
    门合亲自来担承。
    他说：“这危险，我来干！”
    六个大字亮晶晶。
    六个字，字字都从肺腑出，
    六个字，字字如同钢铁声；
    六个字，字字擂响前进鼓，
    六个字，字字闪耀一个“忠”。
      （白）土火箭装了一支又一支。突然，门合身旁的炸药发热起火，眼前装好的土火箭将要发生连锁爆炸！在场的二十七名“八·一八”战士和革命群众，就要遭到不堪设想的后果！
    千钧一发不容缓，
    门合心中太阳升。
    毛主席教导耳边响：
    “为人民利益而死，就比泰
      山还重……。”
    你看他英勇扑在炸药上，
    如同当年战场把敌擒。
    他好象，张思德炭窑之中放
      光辉，
    他好象，董存瑞勇炸敌堡立
      奇功；
    他好象，黄继光身堵枪眼换
        胜利，
    他好象，王杰舍身救民
      兵。
    只听“轰?”一声响，
    壮志化作春雷鸣。
    二十七名阶级兄弟脱了险，
    门合昂首展笑容。
      （白）门合同志，用无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的红心，保卫了无产阶级文化大革命。听！一曲毛泽东思想的凯歌，响彻在青海高原，震荡着万里长空。
    好门合，如同雄鹰展翅飞，
    好门合，如同青松耸入云；
    好门合，你用“忠”字谱赞
      歌，
    好门合，你用“公”字铸忠
        心。
    我们要高举你举的旗，
    我们要高擎你擎的灯；
    我们要永走你走的路，
    我们要学你猛冲锋！
    永远紧跟毛主席，
    海枯石烂不变心。
    彻底埋葬帝、修、反，
    扫除一切害人虫。
    敢教日月换新天，
    誓让全球一片红！
