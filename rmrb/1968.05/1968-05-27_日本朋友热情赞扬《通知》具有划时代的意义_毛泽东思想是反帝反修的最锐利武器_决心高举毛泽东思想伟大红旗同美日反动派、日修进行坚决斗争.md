Japanese Friends Warmly Praise the "Notification" as Having Epoch-Making Significance

Mao Zedong Thought is the Sharpest Weapon Against Imperialism and Revisionism

Determined to Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Resolutely Fight Against the U.S. and Japanese Reactionaries and Japanese Revisionists

	BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) — Japanese revolutionary youth from various parts of Japan recently spoke to Chinese journalists, praising the great historical document, the May 16 Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, and hailing the brilliant victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

	The Student Liaison Conference of the Osaka Prefecture Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) said, the May 16 Notification, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, has epoch-making significance. It is the bugle call for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the great thought of Mao Zedong has been widely propagated, giving great encouragement to the revolutionary people of the whole world. Takahara pointed out that Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in the contemporary world, the sharpest weapon against imperialism and revisionism, and the guiding light for the revolutionary people of the whole world to march towards victory. Japanese revolutionary youth are studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in their struggle against imperialism and revisionism, drawing boundless courage and strength from it.

	Fukuoka Prefecture revolutionary youth Kake said, Chairman Mao has summed up the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat, initiated the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution in human history, solved the problem of preventing capitalist restoration under socialist conditions, and thus greatly developed Marxism-Leninism, bringing it to a new stage.

	He said, the U.S. imperialists, Japanese reactionaries, Soviet revisionists, and Japanese revisionists have from the very beginning fiercely opposed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. However, as Chairman Mao teaches us: being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing. The fact that the imperialist-revisionist-reactionary clique opposes the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China precisely proves that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is very good.

	Tanaka Heihachi of the Kyoto Democratic Youth League (left) said, Chairman Mao teaches us: without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction means criticism, means revolution. Chairman Mao's teaching is a universal truth. Just as the practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has shown, unless the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road are thoroughly defeated, the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be consolidated.

	Ikebe Naotaka of the Kyoto Democratic Youth League (left) said, the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has enabled us to deeply understand the great significance of Chairman Mao's theory of continuing the revolution under socialist conditions.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, Japan-China friendship activists from various parts of Japan recently spoke to Chinese journalists, warmly praising the May 16 Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, as having great significance for the international communist movement.

	Kashiwagi Masakazu, chairman of the Fukuoka Prefecture Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), said, the Notification has great significance for the international communist movement. The brilliant victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China over the past two years have fully proved the correct judgments made by Chairman Mao in the Notification. Chairman Mao has solved the problem of continuing the revolution under socialist conditions both in theory and in practice, which is Chairman Mao's greatest creative development of Marxism-Leninism and his great contribution to the world revolutionary cause.

	Uetake Takayoshi, vice-chairman of the Yamaguchi Prefecture Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), said, Chairman Mao, with his great vision and foresight, initiated and led this proletarian cultural revolution. This great revolution not only severely struck at the counter-revolutionary revisionists in China but also dealt a heavy blow to international imperialism and modern revisionism.

	Nobuyuki Noma, chairman of the Aichi Prefecture Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), highly praised Chairman Mao for creatively developing Marxism-Leninism and pointed out that the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China have inspired the fighting spirit of the revolutionary people of the world. The new developments in the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic struggle and the struggle against modern revisionism are inseparable from the great encouragement and influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

	Amamiya Reizo, chairman of the Osaka Prefecture Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), said, the Notification, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, is a historic document of epoch-making significance. Amamiya said, the great thought of Mao Zedong is the sharpest ideological weapon in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism. The Japanese revolutionary people must arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly defeat the Miyamoto revisionist clique.

	Nakajima Masao, director of the Hyogo Prefecture Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), said, the world has already entered a great new era, an era with the great thought of Mao Zedong as its banner. The Japanese revolutionary people must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely fight against U.S. imperialism, Japanese reactionaries, and the Miyamoto revisionist clique of the Japan Communist Party.

	Kamiya Teru, a Japan-China friendship activist from Yamanashi Prefecture, praised Chairman Mao for developing Marxism-Leninism to a new stage—the stage of Mao Zedong Thought. He said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has enabled the people of the whole world to further realize that great China is the true bastion of world revolution. The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not only the victory of the Chinese people but also the victory of the people of the whole world. He finally shouted, "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

    日本朋友热情赞扬《通知》具有划时代的意义
    毛泽东思想是反帝反修的最锐利武器
    决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗同美日反动派、日修进行坚决斗争
    新华社东京二十四日电　日本各地革命青年最近向中国记者发表谈话，赞扬毛主席亲自主持制定的伟大历史文件中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命取得了辉煌胜利。
    日中友好协会大阪府（正统）总部学生联络会议的高原一彦说，毛主席亲自主持制定的《通知》具有划时代的意义。它是中国无产阶级文化大革命的进军号角。他说，在中国无产阶级文化大革命中，伟大的毛泽东思想得到了广泛的传播，给全世界革命人民以巨大的鼓舞。高原指出，毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是反对帝国主义和修正主义的最锐利的武器，是全世界革命人民走向胜利的指路明灯。日本革命青年在反帝反修斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，从中得到了无限的勇气和力量。
    福冈县革命青年鹿毛说，毛主席总结了无产阶级专政的历史经验，发动了人类历史上空前的无产阶级文化大革命，解决了在社会主义条件下防止资本主义复辟的问题，从而大大地发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义发展到一个崭新的阶段。
    他说，美帝国主义、日本反动派、苏修和日修从一开始就拚命地反对中国无产阶级文化大革命，但是正如毛主席教导我们的：被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。帝修反反对中国无产阶级文化大革命，这恰恰证明中国无产阶级文化大革命好得很。
    京都民主青年同盟（左派）田中平宏说，毛主席教导我们：不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。毛主席的这个教导是普遍真理。正象中国无产阶级文化大革命的实践所表明的那样，不彻底打垮党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，就不能巩固无产阶级专政。
    京都民主青年同盟（左派）池田直隆说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，使我们更加深刻地认识到毛主席关于在社会主义条件下继续进行革命的理论的伟大意义。
    据新华社东京电　日本各地的日中友好活动家最近向中国记者发表谈话，热烈赞扬毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》对世界共产主义运动具有重大意义。
    日中友好协会福冈县（正统）总部理事长柏木正一说，《通知》对国际共产主义运动具有重大意义。两年来，中国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利充分证实了毛主席在《通知》中提出的英明论断。毛主席从理论上和实践上解决了在社会主义条件下继续进行革命的问题，这是毛主席对马克思列宁主义学说的最伟大的创造性的发展和对世界革命事业的伟大贡献。
    日中友好协会山口县（正统）总部副会长上妻隆荣说，毛主席以他伟大的气魄和预见发动和领导了这场无产阶级文化大革命。这场大革命不仅狠狠地打击了中国的反革命修正主义分子，而且沉重地打击了国际帝国主义和现代修正主义。
    日中友好协会爱知县（正统）总部会长野间清高度赞扬毛主席创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，并且指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，激发了世界革命人民的斗志。日本人民反美爱国斗争和反对现代修正主义的斗争的新发展是与中国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大鼓舞和影响分不开的。
    日中友好协会（正统）大阪府总部理事长雨宫礼三说，在毛主席亲自主持下制定的《通知》是一个划时代的历史文献。雨宫说，伟大的毛泽东思想是反帝反修斗争的最锐利的思想武器。日本革命人民要用毛泽东思想武装自己，彻底打垮宫本修正主义集团。
    日中友好协会兵库县（正统）总部事务局长中岛正夫说，当前世界已经进入了伟大的新时代，这就是以伟大的毛泽东思想为旗帜的时代。日本革命人民必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，与美帝、日本反动派和日共宫本修正主义集团进行坚决的斗争。
    山梨县从事日中友好的活动家神宫寺敬赞扬毛主席把马克思列宁主义发展到一个崭新的阶段——毛泽东思想的阶段。他说，无产阶级文化大革命使全世界人民进一步认识到伟大的中国是世界革命的真正堡垒。无产阶级文化大革命的胜利不仅是中国人民的胜利，也是全世界人民的胜利。他最后高呼：“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
