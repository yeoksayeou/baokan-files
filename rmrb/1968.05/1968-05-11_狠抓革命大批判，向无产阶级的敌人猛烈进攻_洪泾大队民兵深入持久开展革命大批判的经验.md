The Hongqing Brigade's experience in intensifying revolutionary criticism is excellent and very inspiring and educational. Their most distinctive feature in carrying out revolutionary criticism is that they always direct the spearhead of the struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev.

It is rare and precious for a production brigade to think so deeply and work so hard to criticize China's Khrushchev, and to grasp the key points, layer by layer, to criticize deeply and thoroughly. This is a manifestation of their high level of proletarian consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle, and it is the most practical and powerful action of their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In studying any process, if it is a complex process involving more than one contradiction, we must focus our efforts on finding the principal contradiction. Once we grasp the principal contradiction, everything else will fall into place."

The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party are the most dangerous enemies attempting to overthrow proletarian dictatorship. They are the primary targets of the revolution under proletarian dictatorship. The contradiction between the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and the broad masses of revolutionary people and this handful of capitalist-roaders is the principal contradiction, an antagonistic contradiction. Therefore, holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, we must actively launch a continuous and fierce attack on the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, with China's Khrushchev as their representative, criticize them deeply and thoroughly, fight them down and expose their stench, and thoroughly eliminate their counter-revolutionary revisionist poison. This is the basic content of the revolution under proletarian dictatorship and the main problem to be solved by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is the direction of the revolutionary struggle.

The reason why the revolutionary criticism in Hongqing Brigade can be deep and persistent, and the effect is good, is because they have grasped this principal contradiction and chosen the correct path.

In his brilliant "May 7th Directive," Chairman Mao said: "The peasants in the commune also need to criticize the bourgeoisie." The militia of Hongqing Brigade in Shaxi Commune, Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, following Chairman Mao's instructions, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, launching continuous attacks on China's Khrushchev and his agents, with great momentum, fierce firepower, active methods, and good results, and have gained some good experience.

China's Khrushchev has always waved the red flag to oppose the red flag. To criticize him, we must first peel off his disguise. How do we peel off his disguise? Cadres militia member Cao Peiying said: Start by comparing to peel off the disguise.

Mao Zedong Thought is a mirror that reveals demons. China's Khrushchev, this old fox dressed up, is exposed by the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought, no matter how tightly he hides his tail. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only through comparison can we distinguish." We follow Chairman Mao's teachings and use the method of comparison to peel off China's Khrushchev's disguise. What Chairman Mao instructs us to do, and what China's Khrushchev poisons and does, once compared and contrasted, China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary face is exposed in broad daylight.

Compare at critical moments. "The enemy of the class will definitely look for opportunities to reveal themselves." No matter how China's Khrushchev disguises himself, at critical moments of class struggle, he will always jump out to perform. After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when the entire Party, army, and people of the nation were fighting under Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership to defend the motherland and resist the invaders, China's Khrushchev threw out the black "Self-Cultivation," urging us to leave the sharp class struggle at that time and engage in bourgeois individualism to cultivate ourselves. Isn't this blatantly helping the Japanese invaders? After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the reactionary Kuomintang madly instigated civil war to seize the fruits of the people's victory. Chairman Mao taught us to fight the reactionary Kuomintang head-on, but China's Khrushchev put forward the fallacy of a "peaceful democratic new stage," wanting to unify the people's armed forces under the Kuomintang's "Ministry of Defense." Isn't this openly surrendering to the people's enemy Chiang Kai-shek?

Compare on major issues. Major issues that decide the fate of the revolution and the future of the country are the focal points of the struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. On such issues, China's Khrushchev will always perform. On the issue of class struggle, Chairman Mao teaches us that in a socialist society, "class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, and the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm are long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very fierce." But what does China's Khrushchev say? He advocates the theory of "extinguishing class struggle," falsely claiming that "the main class struggle within the country has basically ended." This is openly opposing Chairman Mao! On the issue of the two-line struggle in the countryside, Chairman Mao points out that "the people's commune is good," leading us to take the socialist road. China's Khrushchev, however, fiercely attacks the people's commune for being "established too early," shouting "in agriculture, we must retreat enough," wanting us to retreat all the way to individual farming, take the wrong road, and suffer twice.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, led by the Chinese Communist Party and the broad masses of revolutionary people under its leadership, and the continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party and the reactionary Kuomintang, and the continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." In this great political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, it would be a great wonder if the representative of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, China's Khrushchev, did not jump out to perform. We compare China's Khrushchev's reactionary line of the bourgeoisie with Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and we see clearly that China's Khrushchev is engaged in a counter-revolutionary plot to establish bourgeois dictatorship.

No matter how many disguises China's Khrushchev has, no matter how tightly he wraps himself, we grasp Mao Zedong Thought and start by comparing, and we can peel off his disguises layer by layer, seeing that he has a thoroughly poisoned black heart. Once we peel off China's Khrushchev's disguises and see his reactionary face, our hatred for China's Khrushchev fills our chests, and the revolutionary criticism is carried out vigorously.

Strike the snake's head first, because the head is the snake's vital point. In our revolutionary criticism of China's Khrushchev, we must also grasp the vital point and criticize it fiercely. What is his vital point? Militia platoon leader Sun Yonghua said: China's Khrushchev's vital point is his attempt to overthrow proletarian dictatorship.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power, consolidating power. And the counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for maintaining their power." China's Khrushchev desperately opposes Chairman Mao, opposes Mao Zedong Thought, and opposes Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, frantically promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, all for the purpose of overthrowing the proletarian dictatorship, conspiring to restore capitalism in China, and changing the color of our country. This is China's Khrushchev's vital point. We must grasp this vital point to carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism.

Carrying out remembrance and comparison is a good way to recognize the importance of power. The earth-shaking changes before and after liberation are fundamentally changes in power. Before liberation, power was in the hands of landlords and capitalists, and we poor and lower-middle peasants lived like cattle; Chairman Mao led us in revolution, seizing power for the proletariat and laboring people, and we were liberated. Through remembrance of bitterness and sweetness, we realize: above all, it is most important for the proletariat to seize power. China's Khrushchev conspires to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism, and we will not agree to it a thousand times, not agree to it ten thousand times!

In the revolutionary criticism, we cannot criticize individual issues but must connect China's Khrushchev's reactionary words and deeds with the issue of power, so as to see through and criticize deeply. When we criticized China's Khrushchev's fallacy of "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage," we did not connect it with the issue of power at first, and we could not criticize it to the bone. Later, when we connected it with the issue of power and criticized it, we immediately dug out his evil intentions. China's Khrushchev spread this poison with the intention of making us abandon the collective, not care about the country, and calculate everything with "self" in mind, making us forget about proletarian dictatorship, so that his conspiracy could succeed and change proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship. At that time, we laboring people would suffer a big loss, and the landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists would gain a big advantage. China's Khrushchev is truly evil! We must criticize all of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary fallacies from the height of defending proletarian dictatorship, and criticize one, criticize it thoroughly.

The proletariat and laboring people have everything with power and lose everything without power. We must never forget class struggle and never forget proletarian dictatorship. In the midst of the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and all counter-revolutionaries who are unwilling to perish are still struggling desperately, and their evil purpose is still to attempt to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship.

We have seen through this essence, and in the revolutionary criticism, we have become even more conscious of fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev's "theory of extinguishing class struggle" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist goods, and launching even fiercer attacks on the enemies of the proletariat, carrying out the struggle to consolidate and defend proletarian dictatorship to the end.

China's Khrushchev has poisoned for decades and done countless evil deeds. How do we criticize him deeply and thoroughly? Cadres militia member Li Tao said: Criticize key issues repeatedly.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and monsters must be criticized." China's Khrushchev's poison, piece by piece, case by case, must be criticized and eliminated. However, in our rural areas, carrying out revolutionary criticism, we must grasp China's Khrushchev's vital points, grasp the key issues, and thoroughly eliminate his poison. We first grasp and criticize issues directly related to the two-line struggle in the countryside. The key issues we criticize are China's Khrushchev's opposition to emphasizing proletarian politics and his advocacy of the "theory of extinguishing class struggle," "theory of merging public and private," "three autonomies and one contract," "four freedoms," "exploitation is meritorious," and other black goods, because these fallacies are all for his attempt to overthrow proletarian dictatorship and conspire to restore capitalism; these counter-revolutionary fallacies have a wide influence in the countryside, so we adopt the "three-in-one" method to repeatedly criticize these key issues.

First, we combine the criticism of these issues with the exposure of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the county committee. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the county committee are China's Khrushchev's agents in Taicang, the salesmen of China's Khrushchev's black goods. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the county committee openly oppose Chairman Mao's teachings on political leadership and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on emphasizing proletarian politics, and obstruct our brigade's mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They sing the same tune as China's Khrushchev, defaming our brigade's studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as "formalism" and "pragmatism." When we fiercely expose the handful of capitalist-roaders within the county committee, we dig out the roots, expose and criticize at the same time, and fiercely criticize China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary fallacies.

Second, we combine the criticism of these issues with the struggle against local landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, ghosts, and monsters who persist in their reactionary stance. China's Khrushchev advocates the "theory of extinguishing class struggle," but in fact, class struggle still exists, and the class struggle in our brigade is very sharp. There is a landlord element hiding a book of accounts for a change of heaven, plotting to counterattack when the opportunity arises. There is a counter-revolutionary who has sharpened his knife, preparing to kill the brigade cadres. China's Khrushchev advocates the "theory of extinguishing class struggle" to numb our fighting spirit, letting him and his henchmen climb back on our heads to defecate. We use the living facts of local class struggle to criticize, re-criticize China's Khrushchev's "theory of extinguishing class struggle," criticizing it to be stinkier than dog shit.

Third, we combine the criticism of these issues with overcoming the spontaneous capitalist tendencies in the countryside. The "three autonomies and one contract," "four freedoms," and other poisons spread by China's Khrushchev, actively promoted by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the county committee, also have some influence in our brigade. In the great criticism, we link these issues to criticize, present facts, discuss harm, trace the roots, and aim directly at China's Khrushchev, eliminating China's Khrushchev's poisonous threads and striking China's Khrushchev, this poisonous spider.

By repeatedly criticizing key issues, we see more clearly that China's Khrushchev is the representative of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, ghosts, and monsters, and the backer of the handful of capitalist-roaders. They sing the same tune, wear the same pants, sit on the same bench, and walk the same path, and are our poor and lower-middle peasants' sworn enemies. Our hatred for China's Khrushchev increases, and our enthusiasm for carrying out revolutionary criticism grows stronger. Whatever black goods of China's Khrushchev we criticize, we link it to solving related issues, and whatever issues we encounter, we link it to criticizing the related black goods of China's Khrushchev. Each criticism has new content, living targets, criticizing China's Khrushchev solidly, and educating ourselves deeply, making the revolutionary criticism deeper and deeper, promoting the continuous advancement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in this region.

Carrying out revolutionary criticism is to thoroughly eliminate the poison of revisionism. Only by fiercely fighting against "self" can we carry out revolutionary criticism well. How do we fight against "self"? Cadres militia member Sun Yaoji said: We must fight an offensive battle, a battle of annihilation, and a protracted battle.

Chairman Mao issued the battle order to "fight against self and criticize revisionism," which is the guiding light for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Fighting against self and criticizing revisionism are interconnected, and only by fiercely fighting against "self" can we carry out revolutionary criticism well. In the past, I did not understand this issue clearly. After repeatedly studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "fighting against self and criticizing revisionism," as the revolutionary criticism deepens and develops, I gradually realize that revisionism starts from "self," "self" is the root of "revisionism," and if "self" is not overcome, "revisionism" cannot be criticized thoroughly. We must fight a good battle of breaking private thoughts and establishing public thoughts in the depths of our souls, never shielding "self," and never building a shelter for "self."

Fighting against self requires an offensive battle. "Public" loosens a bit, and "self" grows an inch; "self" grows an inch, and "revisionism" grows an inch. This thing called "self," if you do not attack it, it will attack you, attacking you until you become corrupted, and the country changes color. Fighting against self requires a battle of annihilation. "Self" is not a boil on the skin, it is a poisonous tumor in the soul, and it cannot be solved by squeezing and pinching, but must be solved by a major operation. For "self," we must hold on and attack continuously to break down the "self" fortresses one by one, letting "public" occupy the positions one by one. Fighting against self requires a protracted battle. "Self" is not a dead mountain, it is alive, and if you do not dig it out for a day, it will grow back, burrowing into the depths of our souls to build new underground fortresses. Therefore, we must fight against self without stopping, fight for a lifetime, and follow Chairman Mao for a lifetime of revolution.

(Reported by Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, May 10th)

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Donghu Brigade, Chaoyang District, Beijing, under the leadership of the brigade revolutionary committee, launch continuous attacks on the class enemies without stopping. This is them using their rest time to hold a field criticism meeting, exposing and criticizing China's Khrushchev and his agents' heinous crimes of promoting "three autonomies and one contract" and "four freedoms" in the countryside.

    狠抓革命大批判，向无产阶级的敌人猛烈进攻
    ——洪泾大队民兵深入持久开展革命大批判的经验
    编者按：洪泾大队狠抓革命大批判的经验很好，对人很有启发和教育意义。
    他们开展革命大批判的最大特点，就是始终把斗争的矛头对准中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派。
    一个生产大队，能够这样动脑筋、下功夫去批判中国的赫鲁晓夫，并且能够抓住要害，层层剥皮，批深批透，是难能可贵的。这是他们具有高度的无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟的表现，这是他们无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的最实际最有力的行动。
    毛主席教导我们：“研究任何过程，如果是存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”
    党内最大的一小撮走资派，是妄图颠覆无产阶级专政最危险的敌人，是无产阶级专政下革命的主要对象。无产阶级革命派和广大革命人民群众，同这一小撮走资派的矛盾，是主要矛盾，对抗性的矛盾。因此，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判旗帜，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为总代表的党内最大的一小撮走资派，主动发起持续猛烈的进攻，把他们批深批透，斗倒斗臭，彻底肃清其反革命修正主义流毒，这是无产阶级专政下革命的基本内容，是无产阶级文化大革命所要解决的主要问题，也就是革命斗争的大方向。
    洪泾大队的革命大批判所以能持久深入，效果好，就是因为他们捉住了这个主要矛盾，路子走对了。
    毛主席在光辉的“五·七”指示中说：公社农民“也要批判资产阶级”。江苏省太仓县沙溪公社洪泾大队民兵遵照毛主席的指示，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，深入持久地开展革命大批判，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人发起连续不断的进攻，声势大，火力猛，方法活，效果好，并且取得了一些好经验。
    中国赫鲁晓夫一贯打着“红旗”反红旗，我们要批判他，先得剥开他的画皮。怎样剥开他的画皮呢？基干民兵曹培英说：从比较入手剥画皮
    毛泽东思想是照妖镜，照得牛鬼蛇神显原形。中国赫鲁晓夫这只经过梳妆打扮的老狐狸，用毛泽东思想照妖镜一照，他的狐狸尾巴夹得再紧也藏不住。毛主席教导我们：“有比较才能鉴别。”我们就是按照毛主席的教导，用比较的方法剥开中国赫鲁晓夫的画皮的。毛主席是怎么指示的，而中国赫鲁晓夫是怎样放毒的，又是怎么做的，一比较，一对照，中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命面目就暴露在光天化日之下了。
    比，在关键时刻比。“阶级敌人是一定要寻找机会表现他们自己的。”中国赫鲁晓夫不论怎样伪装，但到了阶级斗争的关键时刻，他总要跳出来表演一番。抗日战争开始以后，当全党全军全国人民在毛主席的英明领导下，为保卫祖国反对侵略者而战的辰光，中国赫鲁晓夫抛出了黑《修养》，要我们离开当时尖锐的民族斗争和阶级斗争，去作资产阶级个人主义的修身养性，这不是露骨地给日本侵略者帮忙吗？抗日战争胜利以后，国民党反动派疯狂地挑动内战，要抢夺人民的胜利果实。毛主席教导我们要和国民党反动派进行针锋相对的斗争，可是中国赫鲁晓夫提出个“和平民主新阶段”的谬论，要把人民的武装力量统一于国民党的“国防部”，这不是公开地向人民公敌蒋介石缴械投降吗？
    比，在重大问题上比。决定革命命运和国家前途的重大问题，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的集中点。在这样的问题上，中国赫鲁晓夫总是要表演的。在阶级斗争问题上，毛主席教导我们，在社会主义社会，“阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”而中国赫鲁晓夫是怎么说的呢？他鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，胡说“国内主要的阶级斗争已经基本结束了”。这是公开在和毛主席唱反调！在农村两条道路斗争问题上，毛主席指出“人民公社好”，领导我们走社会主义道路。中国赫鲁晓夫却大肆攻击人民公社“办早了”，叫嚷“农业上也要退够”，要我们一直退到单干，走回头路，吃二遍苦。
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”在这场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命中，资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的总代表中国赫鲁晓夫，不跳出来表演一番那才是天大的怪事呢！我们把中国赫鲁晓夫推行的资产阶级反动路线同毛主席的无产阶级革命路线比一比，就看清了中国赫鲁晓夫大搞资产阶级专政的反革命本性。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的画皮再多，裹得再紧，我们掌握了毛泽东思想，从比较入手，就能把他的画皮一层一层地剥开，就看清了他胸膛里揣着的是一个毒透了的黑心。剥开了中国赫鲁晓夫的画皮，看清了他的反动面目，对中国赫鲁晓夫就仇恨满胸膛，革命大批判就轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。
    打蛇先打头，因为头是毒蛇的要害。我们对中国赫鲁晓夫进行革命大批判，也要抓住要害狠狠批。他的要害是什么呢？民兵排长孙永华说：中国赫鲁晓夫的要害是妄图颠覆无产阶级专政
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”中国赫鲁晓夫拚死反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，疯狂地推行反革命修正主义路线，就是为了颠覆无产阶级的政权，阴谋在中国复辟资本主义，改变我们国家的颜色。这就是中国赫鲁晓夫的要害。我们就是要抓住这个要害去深入开展革命的大批判。
    开展回忆对比，是认识政权重要性的一个好办法。解放前后翻天覆地的变化，最根本的是变在政权上。解放前，政权掌握在地主资本家手里，我们贫下中农过着牛马不如的生活；毛主席领导我们闹革命，把政权夺到无产阶级和劳动人民手中，我们才翻身得解放。经过忆苦思甜，我们认识到：千重要、万重要，无产阶级掌握政权最重要。中国赫鲁晓夫阴谋颠覆无产阶级的政权，复辟资本主义，我们一千个不答应！一万个不答应！
    在革命大批判中，不能就事论事，要把中国赫鲁晓夫的反动言行都同政权问题挂起钩来，才能看得透，批得深。我们批判中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“吃小亏占大便宜”的谬论时，开始没有和政权问题挂起钩来，批不入骨。后来和政权问题挂起钩来批判，一下子就把他的祸心挖了出来。中国赫鲁晓夫放这个毒，目的是要我们丢掉集体，不顾国家，算盘尽往“私”字上打，使我们忘记无产阶级专政，好使他的阴谋得逞，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。到那辰光，吃大亏的是我们劳动人民，占大便宜的是地主富农资本家。中国赫鲁晓夫真是恶毒透顶！我们对中国赫鲁晓夫的一切反革命谬论，都要站在保卫无产阶级政权的高度上去批判，批一个，就批透一个。
    无产阶级和劳动人民有了政权就有了一切，丧失了政权就丧失了一切。我们要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政。在无产阶级文化大革命的一片大好形势下，不甘心于灭亡的叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和一切反革命分子，他们垂死挣扎的罪恶目的，仍然是妄图颠覆无产阶级政权。
    我们认清了这个实质，在革命大批判中，就更加自觉地狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论等反革命修正主义黑货，更加猛烈地向无产阶级的敌人展开进攻，把巩固和保卫无产阶级专政的斗争进行到底。
    中国赫鲁晓夫放了几十年毒，干了数不尽的坏事，怎样把他批深批透？基干民兵李涛说：重点问题反复批
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判”。中国赫鲁晓夫放的毒，一件件，一桩桩，都要批判，都要肃清。但是，我们农村开展革命大批判，要抓住中国赫鲁晓夫的要害，要抓重点，彻底肃清他的流毒。我们首先抓住和农村两条道路斗争直接有关的问题去批判。我们抓的批判重点是中国赫鲁晓夫反对突出无产阶级政治和他鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“公私溶化”论、“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“剥削有功”等黑货，因为他的这些谬论都是为他妄图颠覆无产阶级专政、阴谋复辟资本主义服务的；他的这些反革命谬论在农村流毒较广，影响也大，所以我们采取了“三结合”的办法，对这些重点问题进行了反复的批判。
    一是把对这些问题的批判和揭发县委内一小撮走资派结合起来。县委内的一小撮走资派，是中国赫鲁晓夫在我们太仓的代理人，是中国赫鲁晓夫的黑货售货员。县委内一小撮走资派对毛主席关于政治挂帅的教导，对林副主席关于突出无产阶级政治的指示，公开对抗，对我们大队活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，横加阻挠。他们和中国赫鲁晓夫唱一个腔调，把我们活学活用毛主席著作诽谤为“形式主义”、“实用主义”。我们在狠揭县委内一小撮走资派的辰光，牵藤挖根，一边揭，一边批，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命谬论。
    二是把对这些问题的批判和斗争本地坚持反动立场的地、富、反、坏、牛鬼蛇神结合起来。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，事实上阶级斗争仍然存在，我们大队的阶级斗争就十分尖锐。有个地主分子藏着变天账，妄想待机反攻倒算。有个反革命分子磨好了刀，准备杀害队干部。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，是要麻痹我们的斗志，让他和他的这些爪牙再爬到我们头上来拉屎。我们用本地阶级斗争的活生生的事实，一批、再批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，批得它比狗屎还臭。
    三是把对这些问题的批判和克服农村中的资本主义自发倾向结合起来。中国赫鲁晓夫放的“三自一包”、“四大自由”等毒素，经过县委内一小撮走资派的积极推销，在我们大队也有一些影响。在大批判中，我们联系这些问题来批判，摆事实，谈危害，追根子，矛头直指中国赫鲁晓夫，既搞掉了中国赫鲁晓夫吐的毒丝丝，又打击了中国赫鲁晓夫这只毒蜘蛛。
    抓住重点问题反复批，我们更加看清了中国赫鲁晓夫是地、富、反、坏、牛鬼蛇神的总代表，是一小撮走资派的总后台，他们唱一个调子，穿一条裤子，坐一条凳子，走一条路子，是我们贫下中农的死对头。对中国赫鲁晓夫就恨上加恨，搞革命大批判的劲头就越来越大。我们批判中国赫鲁晓夫的啥黑货，就联系解决有关问题，碰到啥问题，就结合批判中国赫鲁晓夫的有关黑货，每次大批判都有新的内容，活的靶子，对中国赫鲁晓夫批判得扎实，对我们自己教育得也深刻，使革命大批判步步深入，推动了本地区无产阶级文化大革命的不断前进。
    开展革命大批判，是要彻底肃清修正主义的流毒。只有狠斗“私”字，才能很好地开展革命大批判。怎样斗私呢？基干民兵孙耀歧说：要打进攻战、攻坚战、持久战
    毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的战斗号令，这是无产阶级文化大革命的指路明灯。斗私、批修是互相联系的，只有狠斗“私”字，才能很好地开展革命大批判。过去我对这个问题认识不清楚，经过反复活学活用毛主席“要斗私，批修”的最新指示，随着革命大批判的不断深入发展，逐步认识到修从“私”字起，私是“修”字根，“私”字不斗倒，“修”字批不臭，我们一定要在灵魂深处打好破私立公思想仗，决不为“私”字打掩护，做“私”字的防空洞。
    斗私要打进攻战。“公”字松一分，“私”字长一寸；“私”字多一分，“修”字长一寸。“私”字这个东西，你不攻它，它就攻你，一直把你攻得个人变质，国家变色。斗私要打攻坚战。“私”字不是长在皮肉上的脓疮，它是长在灵魂深处的毒瘤，不是挤挤捏捏所能搞掉的，一定要动大手术才能解决问题。对于“私”字，一定要揪住不放，连续进攻，才能把“私”字碉堡一个个攻破，让“公”字占领一个个阵地。斗私要打持久战。“私”字不是一座死山，它是活的，一天不挖，它就要长出来，钻到我们的灵魂深处筑起新的暗堡。所以，我们斗私千万不能斗斗停停，要活一辈子，斗一辈子，紧跟毛主席干一辈子革命。
                          （新华社南京十日电）（附图片）
    北京市朝阳区东湖大队的广大贫下中农，在大队革命委员会的领导下，不停顿地向阶级敌人展开猛烈进攻。这是他们利用休息时间，召开地头批判会，揭露和批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在农村推行“三自一包”“四大自由”的滔天罪行。
