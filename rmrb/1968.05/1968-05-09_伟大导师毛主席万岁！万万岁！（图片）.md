	Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!

	On May 8, our great leader, great supreme commander Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao received revolutionary fighters from all parts of the country. This is the greatest concern and encouragement for the working class, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army across the nation.

	Millions of smiling faces turned towards the red sun. At this joyous moment, these revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary youngsters, who have grown up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, expressed their profound proletarian revolutionary sentiments by shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! May Chairman Mao live ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

	The great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, along with Comrade Zhou Enlai, warmly greeted the revolutionary fighters from all parts of the country. (The photos on this page were taken by our reporter.)
