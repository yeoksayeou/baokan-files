In the surging waves of the French workers' and students' movement, the French revisionist clique has been busily engaged in treacherous activities, serving the ruling class.

After the outbreak of the French workers' strike movement and student movement, the French revisionist clique and the leaders of the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT), which it controls, were frightened out of their wits. They frantically attacked and slandered the revolutionary actions of the masses. One moment they cursed progressive students as "anarchists" and a "leftist splinter group"; the next moment they urged workers and students not to raise "adventurist slogans." They also threatened that if the workers did not follow their directives and if they broke the rules they had set, they would "lose our allies" and face repression from the government authorities.

The French revisionist clique was particularly terrified of the convergence of the student movement with the workers' movement, and thus did everything in its power to obstruct and sabotage it. When progressive students began to go to the factories and take joint action with the striking workers, the leaders of the CGT, controlled by the revisionist clique, shouted loudly, ordering the striking workers to refuse to support the student movement. The union issued a so-called "appeal," which tried to sow discord and split the relationship between progressive students and striking workers, shouting that the "working class does not need guardians" and that the union opposed "people outside the workers' movement trying to give them lessons."

While vigorously sabotaging the revolutionary movements of the workers and students, the French revisionist clique also colluded with the ruling class and its so-called "left-wing parties," winking and nodding, plotting to sell out the workers' strike movement. Just as the strike wave was surging, the leaders of the CGT under the control of the revisionist clique, such as Georges Séguy, spread the word that: "If the government considers our demands for rights, we will go back and tell our members whether they think it is beneficial to return to work." The "Politburo" of the revisionist clique and its leaders, such as Waldeck Rochet, issued a series of "communiqués" and "statements," advocating "true democracy." According to them, "true democracy can open the way to socialism." They shouted at the top of their lungs, "appealing" to the various "left-wing parties" and trade union organizations to reach an agreement on a "social program," attempting to deceive the working class with bourgeois parliamentary democracy and undermine the revolutionary struggle of the working class.

All these facts once again expose the French revisionist clique as nothing but traitors and scabs of the French working class.

The treacherous behavior of the French revisionist clique in the workers' and students' revolutionary movement has won the praise of Western bourgeois newspapers and news agencies. The Agence France-Presse's Paris dispatch on the 17th praised the CGT, controlled by the revisionist clique, for not issuing a general strike order when the workers began to strike, saying its attitude was "relatively moderate." The dispatch went on to say: "It is generally believed (including by government officials) that this major union's refusal to give direct support to the student movement is a factor that may to some extent reduce social tension in France."

The editorial of the British Financial Times on May 21st said that the leaders of the "French General Confederation of Labor," controlled by the French revisionist clique, "seem to be in a state of disarray" and are now busy regaining control of the workers' movement; in their efforts to prevent the workers' protests from developing into "a revolutionary movement," "they are the natural allies of the French government."

    在法国工人学生运动怒涛冲刷之下
    法修工贼面目再次大暴露
    本报讯　在汹涌澎湃的法国工人、学生运动的浪潮中，法国修正主义集团大干叛卖勾当，为统治阶级效劳。
    法国工人罢工运动和学生运动爆发以后，法国修正主义集团和它所控制的法国总工会的头目们吓得心惊胆战，手忙脚乱，不断地对群众的革命行动进行攻击和诬蔑。他们一会儿咒骂进步学生是“无政府主义”，是“左倾分裂集团”；一会儿要求工人和学生不要提出所谓“冒险口号”。他们并且吓唬说，如果工人们不跟着他们的指挥棒转，如果工人们冲破了他们所定的清规戒律，那就会“丧失我们的同盟者”，就会遭到政府当局的镇压。
    法国修正主义集团对于学生运动同工人运动的汇合尤其怕得要死，因此千方百计加以阻挠和破坏。当进步学生开始走向工厂、同罢工工人采取共同行动时，法修集团所控制的法国总工会的头目就大嚷大叫，命令罢工工人拒绝支持学生运动。这个工会发出的所谓“呼吁书”，竭力挑拨和分化进步学生和罢工工人之间的关系，叫嚷什么“工人阶级不需要监护人”，工会反对“工人运动之外的人想给予他们的教训”。
    法国修正主义集团一方面竭力破坏工人和学生群众的革命运动，一方面同统治阶级和它所谓的“左派党”眉来眼去，勾勾搭搭，阴谋出卖工人罢工运动。正当罢工怒潮蓬勃兴起的时候，法修集团控制下的法国总工会的头目乔治·赛吉放出空气说：“如果政府考虑我们的权利要求，我们将回去告诉我们的会员，问他们是否认为复工是有益的。”法修集团的“政治局”及其头目瓦德克·罗歇之流，连续发表“公报”和“声明”，鼓吹什么“真正的民主”。据他们说，“真正的民主可以开辟走向社会主义的道路”。他们声嘶力竭地“呼吁”各“左派党”和各工会组织就一项“社会纲领达成协议”，企图用资产阶级议会民主来欺骗工人阶级，瓦解工人阶级的革命斗争。
    所有这些事实又一次暴露出法国修正主义集团不折不扣的是法国工人阶级的叛徒、工贼。
    法国修正主义集团在工人、学生革命运动中的无耻叛卖行为，博得西方资产阶级报刊和通讯社的赞赏。法新社十七日的巴黎电讯以夸奖的口吻说，法修集团控制下的法国总工会在工人开始罢工时“没有发布总罢工命令”，“态度相当的温和”。电讯接着说：“人们（包括政府人士在内）普遍认为，这个主要的工会这样表示的拒绝给学生运动以直接支持，是一个可能在某种程度上减少法国社会的紧张状态的因素。”
    五月二十一日的英国《金融时报》社论说，法国修正主义集团所控制的“法国总工会的领导人看来被已发生的事态弄得狼狈不安”，他们现在忙于对工人运动重新加以控制；在设法防止工人群众的抗议活动发展成“一场革命运动方面”，“他们是法国政府的天生的盟友”。
