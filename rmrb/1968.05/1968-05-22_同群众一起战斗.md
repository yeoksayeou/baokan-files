	Fighting Together with the Masses
	Shanghai City Chuansha County People's Armed Forces Political Commissar and Shanghai City Chuansha County Revolutionary Committee Chairman, Tao Yuzhang

	Our great leader Chairman Mao personally directed the formulation of the May 16, 1966 Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which has been published for exactly two years. The practice of the tumultuous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years has proven that this brilliant document is our great program for revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. As we reread the Notice, we have an even deeper understanding that the focus of the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship is still the issue of political power, that is, the proletariat must consolidate proletarian dictatorship, and the bourgeoisie wants to overthrow proletarian dictatorship. From the day we seized back the power usurped by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, we have, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, always been vigilant in the great storms of class struggle, fighting together with the masses to consolidate and build the new proletarian revolutionary political power.

	After the proletarian revolutionary masses seized power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, how do we build the proletarian revolutionary political power into a battle command post that is forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line? I repeatedly organized everyone to study the Notice and Chairman Mao's relevant teachings. Chairman Mao taught us: "We Communists are not seeking office, but are seeking revolution. We must have a thorough spirit of revolution. We must not, even for a moment, be separated from the masses. As long as we do not separate from the masses, we will certainly be victorious." Chairman Mao's teachings have shown us the direction forward. We realized that to build a battle command post that is forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we must fight together with the masses on the front line of class struggle. In the past, when we fought battles, we would rush to where the gunfire was, and go to where the struggle was most intense to fight.

	Soon after the Revolutionary Committee was established, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, unwilling to admit defeat, colluded with class enemies in society, sometimes attacking from the right, sometimes from the extreme "left," and launched a frenzied assault on the new Revolutionary Committee, shouting wildly: "Chuansha must have a second round of chaos." To repel the enemy's attack, I went among the masses, investigated with the masses, learned from the masses, and fought together with the masses. Among the masses, my mind was clear, and my vision was broad. I saw that the capitalist roaders had deceived some of the masses, directing the spearhead of the struggle against the proletarian revolutionary masses and against the Revolutionary Committee. Thus, I organized the proletarian revolutionary masses to review Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle," and together analyzed the new situation, new trends, and new characteristics of class struggle, and exposed a capitalist roader in a certain company, engaging in a face-to-face struggle with him. Through the struggle, the masses realized that the so-called "Chuansha must have a second round of chaos" was a rightist reversal wind stirred up by a handful of capitalist roaders colluding with class enemies in society. The lid of class struggle was blown off, and the revolutionary masses' fighting will was even more vigorous, launching a powerful counterattack against the class enemies.

	In the struggle, I had an even deeper understanding that by going deep among the masses and fighting together with the masses, one can be clear-headed and broad-minded, understand the new trends of class struggle, grasp the new characteristics of class struggle, and fight a proactive and offensive battle against the class enemies. This is an important measure to build a revolutionary and mass-linked battle command post. From then on, many standing committee members and committee members actively packed their bags and returned to their units to participate in class struggle and production struggle. Everyone settled down at the grassroots level, fighting together with the broad revolutionary masses, continuously launching attacks against the class enemies. We must be vigilant against arrogance and impetuosity, press forward in victory, and carry out the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end.

    同群众一起战斗
    上海市川沙县人民武装部政治委员上海市川沙县革命委员会主任  陶玉章
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》，已经发表整整两年了。两年来轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命的实践证明，这一光辉文件是我们在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的伟大纲领。当我们重温《通知》的时候，更加深刻地体会到，无产阶级专政条件下两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的焦点，仍然是政权问题，就是无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政，资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政。我们从党内一小撮走资派手里夺回被他们窃取的权力的第一天起，就根据毛主席的教导，时刻注意在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，同群众一起，巩固和建设新生的无产阶级革命政权。
    无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资派夺权以后，怎样把无产阶级革命政权建成永远忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的战斗指挥部呢？我反复组织大家学习了《通知》和毛主席的有关教导。毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。只要我们不脱离群众，我们就一定会胜利。”毛主席的教导，给我们指明了前进的航向。我们认识到，要建设一个永远忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的战斗指挥部，必须在阶级斗争第一线同群众一起摸爬滚打。我们过去打仗，就是这样，那里枪声响，就往那里奔，那里斗争最激烈，就到那里去战斗。
    革命委员会成立不久，党内一小撮走资派不甘心失败，他们勾结社会上的阶级敌人，时而从右的方面，时而从极“左”方面，向新生的革命委员会进攻，疯狂地叫喊：“川沙必须第二次大乱”。为了击退阶级敌人的进攻，我迈开双腿走到群众中，向群众调查，向群众学习，同群众一起战斗。在群众中头脑就清醒，眼界就开阔。看到了走资派蒙蔽一部分群众，把斗争矛头对准无产阶级革命派，对准革命委员会的阴谋。于是，我组织无产阶级革命派战士重温毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，和大家一起分析阶级斗争的新形势、新动向、新特点，揪出了某公司的走资派，与他展开了面对面的斗争。通过斗争，使群众认识到，所谓“川沙必须第二次大乱”，就是一小撮走资派勾结社会上的阶级敌人，刮起的一股右倾翻案妖风。阶级斗争盖子揭开了，革命群众的战斗意志更加旺盛，向阶级敌人进行了有力的反击。
    在斗争中，使我更加深刻地体会到，深入群众之中，同群众一起摸爬滚打，就能耳聪目明，头脑清醒，了解阶级斗争的新动向，把握阶级斗争的新特点，就能向阶级敌人打主动仗，打进攻仗。这是建设一个革命化的联系群众的战斗指挥部的重要措施。从此，许多常委和委员都主动打起背包回到本单位参加阶级斗争和生产斗争。大家在基层安家落户，同广大革命群众一起，不断地向阶级敌人发动进攻。我们一定要戒骄戒躁，乘胜前进，把无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底。
