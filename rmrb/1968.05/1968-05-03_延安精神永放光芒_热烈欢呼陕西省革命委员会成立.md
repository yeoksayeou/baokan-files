The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is continuing to advance triumphantly. On the proletarian holiday of May Day, the Shaanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee was solemnly established!

This is another great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! This is another great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

We joyfully salute the proletarian revolutionary forces and the 21 million people of Shaanxi Province, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition, and the entire military and civilian personnel of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shaanxi, with proletarian revolutionary greetings!

In the revolutionary war years, Chairman Mao compared "Yan'an or Xi'an" to "revolution or counter-revolution" to educate us on how to distinguish between enemies and ourselves. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, Yan'an was the revolutionary center where Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Party led the Chinese people in their victorious struggle against imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries; Xi'an was an important counter-revolutionary base of the Kuomintang reactionaries who were anti-communist and anti-people. The struggle between Yan'an and Xi'an, the struggle between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, was a struggle concerning two paths, two destinies, and two futures for China. In the long struggle, the spirit of Yan'an, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, represented the thorough revolutionary spirit of Marxism-Leninism and the spirit of hard struggle of the proletariat.

After liberation, the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices Peng Dehuai, Gao Gang, Xi Zhongxun, Liu Lantao, and others, a small handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, with wolfish ambitions, worked hard to plot to overthrow socialism and restore capitalism in the Northwest and Shaanxi. They recruited traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries and anti-Party elements, and formed one black clique after another. The struggle between the proletarian revolutionary forces and the largest handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents in the Northwest and Shaanxi is, in essence, as Chairman Mao pointed out: a continuation of the long struggle between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang reactionaries, a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary forces and the broad masses of revolutionary people in Shaanxi Province, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carried forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and launched a fierce struggle against the largest handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents in the Northwest and Shaanxi, such as Liu Lantao, Zhao Shouyi, and Li Qiming. The struggle was fierce and arduous, but Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line pointed out the general direction of the struggle for the broad masses of revolutionary people. After repeated struggles, they finally smashed the plot to restore capitalism and achieved decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The broad military and civilian personnel of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shaanxi have firmly stood on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, "supporting the leftist masses," and made great contributions in the "three supports and two militaries" work. They followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "carry out heart-to-heart talks, this method is very good," and conducted extensive propaganda activities in factories, rural areas, institutions, and schools to be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, which is to be loyal to the Party and the people. They carried out patient and meticulous ideological and political work, strengthened military-civilian unity, and further consolidated military-civilian relations.

To develop the good situation and carry the revolution through to the end, at present, we must firmly oppose rightist opportunism, rightist splitism, and rightist capitulationism. We must prevent the slackening of fighting spirit and the stagnation of progress. We must use the class analysis viewpoint to look at various problems in the movement and be good at distinguishing between enemy contradictions and contradictions among the people. We must start from the major issues of the struggle between the two lines, carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly eliminate the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary forces must consider the overall situation of the revolution. Be vigilant and expose the enemy's attempts to use sectarianism, factionalism, and cliquism to split the proletarian revolutionary forces, split the newly established revolutionary committees, and sabotage military-civilian unity. We must safeguard the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and never allow a small handful of capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to reverse their cases, and never allow the capitalist reactionary line to reverse its cases.

We hope that after the establishment of the Shaanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, it will grasp the essence, put the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in the forefront of all work, continue to vigorously run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, criticize and repudiate revisionism, promote the thought revolutionization of people, continue to promote the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces by system, by industry, and by class, and strengthen and develop the revolutionary three-in-one combination. We must love and support the military. We must carry forward the spirit of hard struggle of Yan'an, streamline administration, economize for the revolution, and always be vigilant against various tendencies of alienation from the masses. We must seize the revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness, and do a better job in all aspects. All comrades participating in the work of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee must implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and make the revolutionary committee a truly revolutionary, representative, and authoritative organ of proletarian dictatorship.

We believe that the Shaanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the broad comrades of the proletarian revolutionary forces, in the struggle to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will surely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be modest and prudent, and strive for greater glory. Let us make Shaanxi Province a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, and let the spirit of Yan'an shine forever!

　　延安精神永放光芒
　　——热烈欢呼陕西省革命委员会成立
    《人民日报》《解放军报》社论
    无产阶级文化大革命正继续胜利前进。在无产阶级的战斗节日——“五一”国际劳动节，陕西省革命委员会隆重地成立了！
    这是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利！这是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利！
    我们兴奋地向具有光荣革命传统的陕西省无产阶级革命派和两千一百万陕西人民，向人民解放军驻陕西部队全体指战员，致以无产阶级的战斗的敬礼！
    毛主席在革命战争年代，曾经把“延安还是西安”比作“革命还是反革命”，以此来教育我们划清敌我界限。在抗日战争和解放战争时期，延安，是毛主席和党中央领导中国人民向帝国主义、国民党反动派进行胜利斗争的革命中心；西安，是国民党反动派反共、反人民的一个反革命重要基地。延安和西安的斗争，共产党和国民党的斗争，是关系着中国两条道路、两种命运、两个前途的斗争。在长期斗争中用毛泽东思想培育起来的延安精神，代表了马克思列宁主义的彻底革命精神，代表了无产阶级的艰苦奋斗精神。
    解放以后，中国赫鲁晓夫及其死党彭德怀、高岗、习仲勋、刘澜涛等党内一小撮走资派，怀着狼子野心，苦心经营，妄图在西北和陕西推翻社会主义，复辟资本主义。他们招降纳叛，结党营私，搜罗了一小撮叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子、反党分子，拼凑了一套又一套黑班子。无产阶级革命派同中国最大的一小撮走资派及其在西北和陕西的代理人所进行的激烈斗争，实质上，正如毛主席指出的：是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，陕西省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬无产阶级彻底革命精神，大造了党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在西北和陕西的代理人刘澜涛、赵守一、李启明之流的反。斗争是剧烈的、艰苦的，但是，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为广大革命群众指明了斗争的大方向，经过反复的较量，终于摧毁了他们复辟资本主义的阴谋，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    人民解放军驻陕西部队广大指战员，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，“支持左派广大群众”，在“三支”“两军”工作中作出了巨大贡献。他们遵照毛主席“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好”的教导，在工厂、农村、机关、学校广泛开展忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，也就是忠于党、忠于人民的宣传活动，进行耐心细致的思想政治工作，加强了军民团结，进一步密切了军民关系。
    为了发展大好形势，将革命进行到底，在当前，要坚定地反对右倾机会主义，反对右倾分裂主义，反对右倾投降主义。要防止斗志松懈、停滞不前的情绪。要用阶级分析的观点看待运动中的各种问题，善于区别敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾。要从两条路线斗争的大是大非出发，深入地持久地开展革命大批判，彻底肃清反革命修正主义路线的流毒。无产阶级革命派的同志，要顾革命的大局。警惕和揭露阶级敌人利用山头主义、宗派主义、小团体主义，妄想分裂无产阶级革命队伍，分裂新生的革命委员会和破坏军民团结的阴谋活动。要保卫无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果，决不准许一小撮走资派、叛徒、特务、地、富、反、坏、右分子翻案，决不准许资产阶级反动路线翻案。
    我们希望，陕西省革命委员会成立以后，要狠抓根本，把活学活用、学好用好毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位，继续大力办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，斗私，批修，促进人的思想革命化，继续促进按系统、按行业、按班级的无产阶级革命派的革命的大联合，大力巩固和发展革命的三结合，搞好各单位的斗、批、改。要拥军爱民。要发扬延安的艰苦奋斗精神，精兵简政，节约闹革命，时刻注意克服脱离群众的各种倾向。要抓革命、促生产、促工作、促战备，把各方面的工作做得更好。所有参加省革命委员会工作的同志，都要执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，使革命委员会真正成为革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的无产阶级专政机关。
    我们相信，陕西省革命委员会和广大无产阶级革命派的同志们，在落实毛主席最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗中，一定会更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，争取更大光荣，把陕西省办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，让延安精神代代相传，永放光芒！
