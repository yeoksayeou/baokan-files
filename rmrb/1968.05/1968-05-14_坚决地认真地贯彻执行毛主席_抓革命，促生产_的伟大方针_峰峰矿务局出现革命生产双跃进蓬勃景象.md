In the midst of the triumphant song of seizing a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary cadres of the Fenyang Coal Mining Bureau in Hebei Province, with the help of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the mines, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They have set up extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, vigorously carried out class struggle, and deeply and persistently conducted revolutionary criticism and struggle. They resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," and the entire bureau presents a thriving scene of dual advances in revolution and production.

By mid-March, the bureau and its 21 subordinate units had all established revolutionary committees. The broad revolutionary masses, through deep and persistent revolutionary criticism and struggle, have continuously eliminated the poison of revisionism spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, and have exposed one by one the traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks. This has greatly raised class consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines. The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres are spirited and enthusiastic, greatly promoting the development of production. On the basis of overfulfilling the state production plan for March this year, the production in April has been further increased. The coal production has overfulfilled the state plan by 7.8%. Since entering May, the entire bureau has overfulfilled the daily production plan every day, and in the first ten days, it has overproduced 26,900 tons of coal.

		Conducting extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, vigorously carrying out class struggle and line struggle education, thoroughly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and promoting the thought revolutionization of people

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Conducting study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." Since last October, the Fenyang Coal Mining Bureau has conducted various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. So far, 550 classes have been conducted, with over 21,000 people participating, accounting for more than 70% of the total number of revolutionary cadres in the bureau.

The study classes focus on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, widely carrying out activities of recalling and comparing, and recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, greatly raising the class consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines among the broad revolutionary masses.

Through conducting extensive study classes, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the broad revolutionary masses criticize and repudiate themselves, oppose bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, consolidate and develop revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-one combinations, powerfully promoting production. For example, the revolutionary cadres of the Yonghong Mine, through conducting study classes, achieved revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-one combinations in March this year, and both the spiritual and production faces have undergone great changes. In April, they overfulfilled the state production plan.

Through learning in the study classes, the broad revolutionary cadres have thoroughly criticized and repudiated the bourgeois "self," thoroughly established the proletarian "public," and together with the revolutionary masses, vigorously grasp the revolution and vigorously promote production, receiving warm welcome from the masses. The revolutionary cadres of the 608 mining team of the Dongfanghong Mine, after learning and raising their consciousness, have led the masses to insist on the eight-hour work system and overfulfill the production tasks every month. The leading members of the revolutionary committees of the Hongqi Mine and the Fanxiugai Mine have insisted on working underground with the workers and have been praised by the workers.

Through conducting extensive study classes, the entire bureau has emerged a large number of active elements who study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. In the first half of April this year, the revolutionary committee of the bureau held a conference of representatives of active elements who study and apply Mao Zedong Thought throughout the bureau, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new stage, further promoting the thought revolutionization of the broad cadres, and setting off a new upsurge of grasping the revolution and promoting production.

		Vigorously carrying out class struggle, deeply and persistently conducting revolutionary criticism and struggle, and resolutely striking down the sabotage plots of a handful of class enemies

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not willingly accept their defeat, and they will make their last struggles." The revolutionary committees at various levels of the Fenyang Coal Mining Bureau, in the face of the great situation of achieving victories in revolution and production, have timely organized the broad revolutionary masses to seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, and analyzed the new trends and characteristics of class struggle in the new situation. Everyone deeply understands that the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to complete victory, the more complex and profound the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines becomes. They have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, deeply and persistently conducted revolutionary criticism and struggle, resolutely struck down the sabotage plots of a handful of class enemies using anarchism to create production accidents, and further raised the class consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines among the broad revolutionary masses, further igniting their revolutionary enthusiasm for grasping the revolution and promoting production. The revolutionary cadres of the Lixin Mine, through criticizing and struggling against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the coal mines, have further established the thought of mining coal for the revolution, voluntarily insisted on the eight-hour work system, and overfulfilled the state production plans for the first quarter and April this year. The revolutionary cadres of the Hongqi and Fanxiugai Mines, through exposing and criticizing a handful of class enemies inciting anarchism, have strengthened revolutionary organizational discipline and overfulfilled the state production plans for March and April. The revolutionary cadres of the Hongqi and Yonghong Mines, in the revolutionary criticism and struggle, have exposed the hidden counter-revolutionaries and landlord elements who sabotage production, and their revolutionary enthusiasm has soared, with production flourishing.

Recently, great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution of the proletariat under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the reactionary Kuomintang led by the broad revolutionary people and the masses, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." After this latest instruction of Chairman Mao was issued, the various factories, mines, and units under the jurisdiction of the Fenyang Coal Mining Bureau immediately conducted extensive, repeated, and thorough learning, discussion, and propaganda. The broad revolutionary masses are full of revolutionary spirit and launch more fierce attacks on a handful of class enemies, striving to achieve greater victories in revolution and production.

		Setting off a wave of learning from the People's Liberation Army, further enhancing the revolutionary nature and organizational discipline of the broad cadres, is an important guarantee for achieving dual victories in revolution and production

The revolutionary committees at various levels of the Fenyang Coal Mining Bureau, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teachings of "believing in and relying on the People's Liberation Army" and "supporting the army and loving the people," have led the broad revolutionary cadres throughout the bureau to resolutely support the People's Liberation Army, learn from the People's Liberation Army, and promote the thought revolutionization of the cadres, powerfully promoting production. The bureau revolutionary committee has made two decisions, calling on the revolutionary cadres throughout the bureau to take the People's Liberation Army as an example, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, highlight proletarian politics, vigorously carry out the four firsts, and promote the three-eight style. They also learn from the People's Liberation Army's experience in carrying out the four good teams, and in the class struggle and the struggle of grasping the revolution and promoting production, carry out the mass activity of the four good mining teams and the four good mining teams. The revolutionary committee often invites comrades from the People's Liberation Army to give reports, widely talk about revolutionary struggle history, and talk about the four firsts and the three-eight style, conducting revolutionary traditional education for revolutionary cadres.

The People's Liberation Army stationed in the mines take the lead in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, often go down to the mines and work shifts with the workers. They are not afraid of hardship and fatigue, go where there are difficulties, and set an example for the workers to learn from. Many worker comrades say: The People's Liberation Army is Chairman Mao's good soldier, the people's child. We must forever learn from the People's Liberation Army, criticize and repudiate ourselves, establish the public, strengthen revolutionary nature and organizational discipline, vigorously grasp the revolution, and vigorously promote production.

Through learning from the People's Liberation Army, Mao Zedong Thought has been more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the broad revolutionary cadres insist on doing well in revolution above ground and production below ground, with the attendance rate and work hour utilization rate generally improved, ensuring the development of production.

    到三月中旬，局及所属单位全部建立革委会。四月份原煤生产超额百分之七点八完成国家计划。进入五月以来，全局日产计划天天超额完成，前十天就超产原煤两万六千九百多吨
    据新华社石家庄十二日电　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，河北峰峰矿务局无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，在驻矿人民解放军的帮助下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，大办毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓阶级斗争，持久深入地开展革命大批判，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，全局呈现出革命和生产双跃进的蓬勃景象。
    到三月中旬，峰峰矿务局以及所属的二十一个单位，全部成立了革命委员会。广大革命职工通过深入持久地开展革命大批判，不断清除中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所散布的修正主义流毒，把混进革命队伍的叛徒、特务和反革命分子一个个地揪出来，大大提高了阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争的觉悟。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众精神焕发，斗志昂扬，大大促进了生产的发展。全局在超额完成今年三月份国家生产计划的基础上，四月份生产又有更大的提高，原煤生产超额百分之七点八完成了国家计划。进入五月份以来，全局天天超额完成日产计划，前十天就超产原煤两万六千九百多吨。
      大办毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓
  阶级斗争教育和路线斗争教育，全
  面落实毛主席的最新指示，促进人
    的思想革命化
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”峰峰矿务局从去年十月开始大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，到目前为止已经办了五百五十多期，参加学习的有两万一千多人，占全局革命职工总人数的百分之七十以上。
    学习班狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的教育，广泛开展回忆对比、忆苦思甜活动，大大提高了广大革命职工的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    通过大办学习班，落实毛主席的最新指示，广大革命职工斗私批修，反对资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上巩固和发展了革命大联合、革命三结合，有力地推动了生产。譬如，永红矿革命职工通过大办学习班，在今年三月份实现革命大联合和革命三结合，人的精神面貌和生产面貌都发生了很大变化，四月份就超额完成了国家生产计划。
    通过在学习班的学习，广大革命干部大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，同革命群众一起狠抓革命，猛促生产，受到群众的热烈欢迎。东方红矿六○八掘进队的革命干部经过学习提高思想觉悟以后，以身作则，带领群众坚持八小时工作制，月月超额完成生产任务。红旗矿和反修矿的革委会领导成员，坚持同工人一起下井劳动，受到了工人的好评。
    通过大办学习班，全局涌现了一大批活学活用毛泽东思想的积极分子。今年四月上半月，矿务局革委会召开全局活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会，把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向新的阶段，进一步促进广大职工的思想革命化，掀起了抓革命，促生产的新高潮。
      狠抓阶级斗争，持久深入地开
  展革命大批判，坚决打击一小撮阶
  级敌人的破坏阴谋
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”峰峰矿务局各级革命委员会，在革命和生产取得节节胜利的大好形势下，及时组织广大革命职工认真学习毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的论述，分析了新形势下阶级斗争的新动向、新特点。大家深刻地认识到，无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争越是复杂，越是深刻。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，持久深入地开展革命大批判，坚决打击一小撮阶级敌人利用无政府主义进行破坏，制造生产事故等种种阴谋活动，进一步提高了广大革命职工的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，更加激发了他们抓革命，促生产的革命热情。立新矿革命职工通过对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在煤矿的代理人的大批判、大斗争，进一步树立了为革命挖煤的思想，自觉坚持八小时工作制，超额完成了今年第一季度和四月份的国家生产计划。红旗、反修等矿革命职工，通过揭发批判一小撮阶级敌人煽动无政府主义，增强了革命的组织纪律性，超额完成了三、四两个月的国家生产计划。红旗矿和永红矿的革命职工，在革命大批判中揪出了破坏生产的暗藏的反革命分子和地主分子，革命热情更加高涨，生产蒸蒸日上。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近极其深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席的这一最新指示发表以后，峰峰矿务局所属各厂矿、各单位，立即广泛地、反复地展开了大学习、大讨论、大宣传。广大革命职工斗志昂扬，向一小撮阶级敌人发动更加猛烈的进攻，夺取革命和生产的更大胜利。
      掀起大学解放军的热潮，进一
  步增强广大职工的革命性和组织纪
  律性，是夺取革命、生产双胜利的
    重要保证
    峰峰矿务局各级革命委员会，遵照毛主席的“相信和依靠人民解放军”和“拥军爱民”的伟大教导，带领全局广大革命职工，坚决拥护解放军，学习解放军，促进职工的思想革命化，有力地推动了生产。矿务局革委会曾两次作出决定，号召全局革命职工以解放军为榜样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，狠抓四个第一，大兴三八作风。他们还学习解放军开展四好连队的经验，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，在抓革命，促生产的斗争中，开展了四好回采班、四好掘进队的群众性活动。革委会经常请解放军同志作报告，大讲革命斗争史，大讲四个第一和三八作风，对革命职工进行革命的传统教育。
    驻矿人民解放军带头活学活用毛泽东思想，经常下井和工人一起顶班劳动。他们不怕苦，不怕累，那里有困难就到那里去，为工人们树立了学习的榜样。许多工人同志说：解放军是毛主席的好战士，人民的子弟兵。我们要永远向解放军学习，破私立公，加强革命性和组织纪律性，狠抓革命、猛促生产。
    通过大学解放军，毛泽东思想更加深入人心，广大革命职工坚持井上搞好革命，井下搞好生产，出勤率和工时利用率普遍提高，保证了生产的发展。（附图片）
