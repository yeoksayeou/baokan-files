The revolutionary committees of Zhejiang, Gansu, and Ningxia solemnly present Chairman Mao's brilliant works to the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are overjoyed to receive the revolutionary treasures, repeatedly shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" They resolutely declare that in the struggles of class and production, they will better apply Chairman Mao Zedong Thought, achieve double victories in revolution and production, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, May 24th - The revolutionary committee of Zhejiang Province recently presented each household of poor and lower-middle peasants in the province with a copy of the revolutionary treasure "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" or "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and a copy of the "Three Articles." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, overjoyed to receive the revolutionary treasures, resolutely declare that in the struggles of class and production, they will strive to better apply Chairman Mao Zedong Thought and turn Zhejiang Province's countryside into a vast school of Mao Zedong Thought.

On the day the revolutionary treasures were presented to the poor and lower-middle peasants, the vast countryside of Zhejiang Province, whether by the banks of the Qiantang River, the Yandang Mountains, the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou Plain, or the islands of the East China Sea, was filled with joy. Everywhere, poor and lower-middle peasants carried portraits of Chairman Mao, held high red flags, beat drums and gongs, and warmly and solemnly welcomed the revolutionary treasures. Many places also held ceremonies to present the books. When the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants received the revolutionary treasures, their hearts turned red, and they enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

After receiving the revolutionary treasures, the poor and lower-middle peasants in various places determined to strive even harder to apply Chairman Mao Zedong Thought in the struggles of class and production. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Jin Hua and Shaoxing regions, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by China's Khrushchev, and the tide of revolutionary criticism surged higher and higher. The fishermen of the Zhoushan Archipelago, who are busily engaged in the summer fishing season, received the revolutionary treasures, and their enthusiasm for revolution and production soared. They determined to respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production" with actual actions and achieve a bumper harvest in the summer fishing season. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the South Lake of Jiaxing, after receiving the revolutionary treasures, reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle. They said, they must remember Chairman Mao's instruction to "never forget class struggle," and launch relentless attacks on the class enemies, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and achieve an overall victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, May 24th - The revolutionary committee of Gansu Province recently decided to present each household of poor and lower-middle peasants in the province with a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong." This is a great joyful event in the political life of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Gansu Province.

Currently, the more than two million copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" to be presented to the poor and lower-middle peasants have all been transported to the countryside.

The revolutionary committees at various levels in Gansu Province regard presenting "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" to the poor and lower-middle peasants as a highly honorable political task and, with the highest political enthusiasm and the fastest speed, delivered the revolutionary treasures into the hands of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

After receiving the revolutionary treasures, various places successively held solemn book-presenting assemblies. Some places also held assemblies to mobilize the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, experience-sharing meetings of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, or experience-exchange meetings. The poor and lower-middle peasants, overjoyed to receive the revolutionary treasures, enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Liu Ru Yi, a 62-year-old old poor peasant from Liu Qian Production Team in Yatuo Commune, Yulin County, was driven out by the landlord in the old society and spent 20 years wandering. When he received the revolutionary treasures, he excitedly said, "Although I am illiterate, I will ask others to read it to me, listen to a sentence, remember a sentence, and use a sentence. I will treat Chairman Mao's book as a family treasure and pass it down to future generations."

Many communes' poor and lower-middle peasants, after receiving the revolutionary treasures, immediately held revolutionary criticism assemblies on the spot, fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev for obstructing and sabotaging the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and attempting to restore capitalism. They determined to further launch a new high tide of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, unswervingly follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao, grasp revolution, promote production, achieve double victories in revolution and production, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Currently, the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is developing more broadly and deeply in Gansu Province. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes are springing up like bamboo shoots after a rain, covering the entire province. By the end of April, the province had held more than 200,000 study classes of various types, with more than 700 million participants.

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, May 24th - The revolutionary committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region recently decided to present each household of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary martyrs' families in the region with a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and the "Five Articles"; present each grassroots cadre in the countryside with a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" and the "Five Articles"; and present each commune, production brigade, and production team in the countryside with three sets of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and three copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." This is a great joyful event in the political life of the broad masses of Hui and Han poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres in the countryside.

In recent days, the poor and lower-middle peasants in cities and counties such as Yinchuan, Shiquanshan, and Qingtongxia have already received the revolutionary treasures.

When the revolutionary treasures arrived in the vast countryside, the poor and lower-middle peasants dressed in festive attire, held high portraits of Chairman Mao and red flags, beat drums and gongs, and joyfully welcomed the colorful cars transporting the revolutionary treasures, and solemnly held book-presenting assemblies. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres in the countryside, overjoyed to receive the long-awaited revolutionary treasures, were moved to tears, repeatedly shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" After receiving the revolutionary treasures, the poor and lower-middle peasants of the First Production Team in Hongxing Brigade, Xingwu Commune, Qingtongxia County, stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and solemnly swore: forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They declared that they would read Chairman Mao's books for life, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and follow Chairman Mao in revolution.

The poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres in the countryside, after receiving the revolutionary treasures, angrily denounced China's Khrushchev and his agents in Ningxia for resisting and sabotaging the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside. They excitedly said: Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. Of all importance, studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is the most important. We must take Dazhai as an example and, like the people of Dazhai, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and turn Ningxia's countryside into a vast school of Mao Zedong Thought.
