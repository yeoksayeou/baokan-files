	Washington, May 10 (Xinhua) — The U.S. imperialist puppet government of Thailand, led by Prime Minister Thanom, was summoned to Washington for a two-day "visit" on May 8. He held a series of talks with U.S. imperialist leader Johnson and others, conspiring to further intensify the invasion of Vietnam and to suppress the Thai people's burgeoning armed revolutionary struggle.

	Thanom's visit to the United States took place at a time when the U.S. imperialist war in Vietnam is on the verge of complete failure. The U.S. is frantically playing the "peace talks" trick and war blackmail simultaneously. The joint communiqué issued after the talks also shows that U.S. imperialism is attempting to use these two counter-revolutionary tactics to occupy half of Vietnam. The communiqué blustered that the United States must "make efforts on two fronts," both maintaining a "strong military position" and "seeking diplomatic solutions," in order to achieve a so-called "just and lasting peace" that allows the United States to remain in South Vietnam.

	Johnson summoned Thanom, this loyal lackey, to Washington to further bind Thailand to the U.S. war chariot, making it a spearhead for U.S. aggression in Southeast Asia, particularly in the Vietnam War, and providing the United States with military bases and more cannon fodder. To achieve this goal, Johnson, on the one hand, lavishly praised Thailand's "contributions" to the Vietnam War and expressed his willingness to continue providing "assistance" to the Thai reactionaries, while on the other hand, emphasizing the importance of the South Vietnamese puppet regime's fate to the security of other countries in the region, he boasted that the United States had no intention of abandoning its military and economic obligations in Southeast Asia and "sacrificing Asia."

	To ensure that Thailand, this important base for U.S. aggression in Southeast Asia, remains secure, Johnson, during this round of talks, strongly supported the Thanom puppet regime's efforts to suppress the Thai people's increasingly intense armed struggle. The communiqué revealed that Thanom reported to Johnson on the "plans" he had drawn up to suppress the domestic people's struggle and begged the United States to provide "training, equipment, and advice" in the form of assistance, while Johnson readily agreed, promising that the United States would "continue to provide assistance" to "deal with communist illegal activities." On the day before the U.S. and Thai leaders issued the communiqué on May 9, the two countries signed a so-called "assistance" agreement. According to this agreement, the United States will provide Thailand with 12 million U.S. dollars to arm the Thai reactionary police.

	This U.S.-Thai talk is one of a series of "consultations" that Johnson, while frantically playing the "peace talks" trick, has been pushing his lackeys and running dogs to intensify the Vietnam War. Before this, Johnson held a secret meeting with the South Korean puppet leader Park Chung-hee in Honolulu on April 16. By the end of May and early June, Johnson will also separately meet with the South Vietnamese puppet Nguyen Van Thieu and Australian Prime Minister Holt.

### 在约翰逊疯狂玩弄“和谈”骗局和战争讹诈同时  美泰密谋加紧强化侵越战争

    在约翰逊疯狂玩弄“和谈”骗局和战争讹诈同时
    美泰密谋加紧强化侵越战争
    新华社十日讯　华盛顿消息：美帝仆从泰国反动政府总理他侬，八日奉召到华盛顿进行了为期两天的“访问”，同美帝头子约翰逊等举行了一系列会谈，密谋进一步强化侵越战争，加紧镇压泰国人民蓬勃高涨的革命武装斗争。
    他侬这次对美国的“访问”，是在美帝侵越战争一败涂地，加紧玩弄“和谈”骗局和战争讹诈两手的情况下进行的。会谈后双方发表的公报也表明，美帝国主义妄想通过玩弄这反革命两手，霸占越南人民的半壁河山。公报叫嚷美国要在“两条战线上进行努力”，既要保持“强有力的军事地位”，又要“谋求外交上的解决办法”，以便达到让美国赖在南越不走的所谓“正义的、持久的和平”。
    约翰逊这次把他侬这条忠实走狗召到华盛顿，就是为了把泰国更紧地绑在美国战车上，充当美国侵略东南亚、特别是进行侵越战争的马前卒，为美国提供军事基地和更多的炮灰。为了达到这个目的，约翰逊一方面大肆赞扬泰国为侵越战争作出了“贡献”，并表示愿意继续对泰国反动派提供“援助”，同时又强调南越傀儡集团的命运“对这个地区的其他国家安全的重要性”，叫嚷美国“无意放弃在东南亚承担的军事和经济义务”而“断送亚洲”。这就是说，他侬傀儡集团为了苟延残喘，就必须死心塌地追随美国侵越政策到底。
    美国为了确保泰国这个在东南亚十分重要的侵略基地，约翰逊在这次会谈中竭力支持他侬傀儡集团加紧镇压泰国人民日益高涨的武装斗争。公报透露，他侬在会谈中向约翰逊报告了为镇压国内人民斗争“而拟订的计划”，并且乞求美国用“提供训练、装备和意见的方式进行援助”，而约翰逊则一口答应，保证美国“继续提供援助”，来“对付共产党人的非法活动”。就在美、泰头目九日发表会谈公报的前一天，美、泰两国签订了一个所谓“援助”协定。根据这个协定，美国将为泰国提供一千二百万美元，用于武装泰国反动警察。
    美泰这次会谈，是约翰逊在猖狂玩弄“和谈”骗局的同时，加紧督促其仆从、走狗为强化侵越战争效劳而举行的一系列“磋商”之一。在此以前，约翰逊曾在四月十六日去檀香山和南朝鲜傀儡头目朴正熙举行了秘密会议。在五月底和六月初约翰逊还将分别召见南越傀儡阮文绍和澳大利亚总理戈顿。
