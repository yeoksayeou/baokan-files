In the instant when an explosion of explosives occurred, Comrade Men He rushed onto the explosives, using his life to protect the safety of twenty-seven class brothers, sacrificing his precious life for defending Chairman Mao, safeguarding Mao Zedong Thought, and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. He fulfilled his vow: "Always think of Chairman Mao, always follow Chairman Mao, always be loyal to Chairman Mao, and always strive for Chairman Mao." In this instant, Comrade Men He's boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line shone with its brightest radiance.

An instant of sacrifice is the result of a lifetime of tempering. Comrade Men He was able to stand up for the people's interests and sacrifice himself for others in this instant because he had a great life; because for twenty years, he was always loyal to Chairman Mao, always loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, always loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and studied Chairman Mao's works diligently; because in the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, he always stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, resolutely executed and defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death. In the revolutionary furnace, Comrade Men He used Mao Zedong Thought to transform his own thoughts, temper his loyalty to Chairman Mao, and became a good cadre who is boundlessly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

A person's life is composed of countless instants. Only a life that is boundlessly loyal to the people, boundlessly loyal to the Party, boundlessly loyal to Chairman Mao, boundlessly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and boundlessly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line can have an instant of "dying for the people's interests." Comrade Men He's life was one of always thinking of Chairman Mao, always following Chairman Mao, always being loyal to Chairman Mao, and always striving for Chairman Mao—a life of boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

We learn from Comrade Men He to be boundlessly loyal to Chairman Mao, boundlessly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and boundlessly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

We must persist in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, establish a selfless communist style, closely connect with the masses, always maintain the hardworking and simple nature of the working people, and turn Mao Zedong Thought into our soul. Only in this way can we, when the Party and the people need us, contribute everything we have, create heroic feats like Comrade Men He, and contribute our lives to propagating and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

    光荣的一瞬间
    人民解放军某部  蒋永才　唐名山
    在炸药发生意外爆炸的一瞬间，门合同志猛扑到炸药上，用生命保护了二十七名阶级兄弟的安全，为保卫毛主席，捍卫毛泽东思想，捍卫毛主席革命路线献出了自己宝贵的生命。实现了他的“一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席”的誓言。就在这一瞬间，门合同志无限忠于毛主席革命路线的光辉思想迸射出最灿烂的火花。
    一瞬的献身取决于一生的锤炼。门合同志之所以能够在这一瞬间为人民利益挺身而出，舍己为人，就是由于他有着伟大的一生；就是由于他二十年如一日，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线，如饥似渴地活学活用毛主席著作；就是由于他在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，一贯地站在毛主席革命路线一边，坚决执行、誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线。在革命的熔炉里，门合同志用毛泽东思想改造自己的思想，锤炼对毛主席的忠心，使自己成为无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部。
    人的一生是由无数个一瞬积累而成的。只有无限忠于人民，无限忠于党，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的一生，才有“为人民利益而死”的一瞬。门合同志的一生，就是一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席的一生，就是无限忠于毛主席革命路线的一生。
    我们学习门合同志，就是要象他那样无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线。
    我们要坚持活学活用毛主席著作，树立毫不利己专门利人的共产主义风格，紧密联系群众，始终保持劳动人民艰苦朴素的本色，把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂。只有这样，才能在党和人民需要的时候，献出自己的一切，创造出象门合同志那样的英雄业绩，为宣传和捍卫毛主席革命路线贡献自己的生命！
