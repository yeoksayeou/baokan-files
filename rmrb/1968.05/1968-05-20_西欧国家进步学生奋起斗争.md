Progressive Students in Western Europe Rise Up in Struggle

Spanish Students Persist in Struggle Against Dictatorship

The struggle of students at Madrid University in Spain against the Franco dictatorship and for democracy and freedom has been ongoing for four days.

On the evening of the 18th, thousands of students held a demonstration in the Political Economy Department against the Franco regime. Their placards bore slogans such as "People's Democracy" and "Workers and Students Unite." After the meeting, the students marched around the university, shouting slogans like "Down with Franco," "We Want Democracy," and "No to Dictatorship."

A large number of fully armed police used batons and water cannons to brutally suppress the demonstrators. The students bravely retaliated with stones, smashing the windows of several police cars.

Many students also broke through the police blockade, dividing into several groups and surging into the center of Madrid, where they marched and demonstrated, shouting for "Freedom."

Belgian Students Occupy Lecture Halls to Demand Educational Reform

On the 17th, hundreds of students at the University of Brussels in Belgium occupied the school's main lecture hall. They shouted slogans such as "Down with the Bourgeois University" and demanded educational reform. In an appeal to the people, they linked their actions with the demonstrations by Paris students.

West Berlin Students Protest Against U.S. Imperialism's Aggression in Vietnam in the Rain

In West Berlin, while the military forces of the U.S., Britain, and France were holding a military parade on the 18th to celebrate what they call "Allied Day," some students braved the rain to protest. They condemned U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam as a "dirty war." As a U.S. infantry unit passed by the gate of the Technical University of Berlin, the students shouted at them, "Butchers of the Vietnamese people!"

    西欧国家进步学生奋起斗争
    西班牙大学生坚持斗争反对独裁政权
    西班牙马德里大学学生反对佛朗哥独裁政权、争取民主自由的斗争已经坚持了四天。
    十八日晚上，数千名学生在政治经济系举行反对佛朗哥政权的示威。他们拿着的标语牌上写着“人民民主”、“工人和学生团结起来”等口号。会后，学生们在大学周围游行示威，高呼“打倒佛朗哥”、“要民主”、“不要独裁”。
    大批全副武装的警察用警棍和水龙对示威学生进行野蛮镇压。学生们用石块进行英勇还击，把几辆警车的玻璃窗砸得粉碎。
    许多学生还冲破警察的阻挠，分成数股涌到马德里市中心，高呼着要“自由”的口号举行游行示威。
    比利时大学生占领讲堂要求实行教育改革
    比利时布鲁塞尔大学的数百名学生十七日占领了学校的大讲堂。他们高呼“打倒资产阶级大学”的口号，要求实行教育改革。在一份给人民的呼吁书中，他们把他们的行动同巴黎学生的示威行动联系在一起。
        西柏林学生冒雨示威反对美帝侵越战争
    在西柏林，当美英法三国驻军十八日举行军事检阅，庆祝所谓“盟军日”的时候，一些学生冒雨示威，谴责美帝国主义进行的侵越战争是一场“肮脏的战争”。在一支美国步兵队伍在西柏林技术大学门前经过时，学生们冲着他们高呼：“屠杀越南人民的刽子手！”
