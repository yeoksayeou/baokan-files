Farmers and students in Sanrizuka, Japan, once again take to the streets in protest

BEIJING, May 8 — According to a report from the East Asia News Agency: More than 800 farmers and young students from Sanrizuka, Chiba Prefecture, who have been persistently opposing the construction of the "New International Airport," held a rally and demonstration on May 7 in the area where the Sato government is attempting to build an airport for the U.S. military. They severely condemned the Sato government's actions in serving U.S. imperialism.

The demonstrators drove away government officials who, under the protection of reactionary police, had intruded into the Sanrizuka farmland to forcibly survey the land.

At the rally, Tomura Kazuo, chairman of the Sanrizuka Farmers' Alliance Against Airport Construction, delivered a speech. He said that the Sanrizuka farmers are determined to unite closely with patriotic workers and youth students to carry on the struggle to stop the airport construction to the end. He said: We resolutely learn from the heroic Vietnamese people who are waging an anti-U.S. struggle for national salvation and from the brave American blacks who are fighting against violence, and we will fight together with them.

Tomura stressed the importance of seriously studying the works of Chairman Mao and applying them in the struggle.

On the same day, the reactionary Sato government dispatched 1,500 armed police from Tokyo, Kanagawa, and other areas to Sanrizuka in an attempt to suppress the rally and demonstration and to protect the government officials who were forcibly surveying the airport land. But they were all driven away by the courageously fighting farmers and students.

At the same time, students set up checkpoints on the main roads from Narita City to Sanrizuka, blocking the passage of government officials and plainclothes police, and drove away a car of the "Self-Defense Forces" that tried to sneak into Sanrizuka.

    把反对为美军修建“新国际机场”的斗争进行到底
    日本三里塚农民和学生再次奋起示威
    新华社八日讯　据东方通讯社报道：一直坚持反对修建“新国际机场”斗争的日本千叶县三里塚农民和青年学生八百多人，七日在佐藤政府企图为美军修建机场的地方举行集会和游行示威，严厉谴责佐藤政府为美帝效劳的行径。
    示威群众赶跑了在反动警察保护下闯进三里塚农田，强行测量土地的政府官员。
    三里塚反对修建机场农民联盟委员长户村一作在集会上发表讲话。他说，三里塚农民决心同爱国工人、青年学生紧密团结起来，把阻止修建机场的斗争进行到底。他说：我们坚决向正在进行抗美救国斗争的英雄的越南人民和正在进行英勇抗暴斗争的美国黑人学习，并且同他们一起战斗。
    户村强调指出要认真学习毛主席著作，并在斗争中活学活用。
    当天，佐藤反动政府从东京、神奈川等地区出动了一千五百名武装警察到三里塚，妄图镇压群众的集会和游行，并保护强行测量机场土地的政府官员。但都被英勇斗争着的农民和学生赶跑了。
    同时，学生们在交通要道成田市到三里塚的沿途，设立了岗哨，阻止政府官员和便衣警察的通行，并赶跑了“自卫队”企图溜进三里塚的一辆汽车。
