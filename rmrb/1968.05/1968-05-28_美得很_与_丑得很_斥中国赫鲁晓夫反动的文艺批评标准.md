"The 'Beautiful Indeed' and 'Ugly Indeed'"
– Denouncing the Reactionary Art Criticism Standards of the Chinese Khrushchev
Beijing Municipality, Haidian District, Shangzhuang People's Commune, Tan Hui

The Chinese Khrushchev once loudly proclaimed: “Watching *Swan Lake* can lift one's spirits, and the artistic level of *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* is also very high,” “The artistic level of Peking Opera is very high and should not be underestimated or changed recklessly,” “Isn't it alright to sing *The Four Generals Visit Their Mother*?” He even slandered modern art by saying, “In terms of artistic level, it is not as high as that of the feudal era.” This is all nonsense, thoroughly reactionary.

Chairman Mao teaches us: “Each class in each class society has different political standards and different artistic standards.” The old art of the feudal landlord class and the bourgeoisie is considered “beautiful” and “high in artistic level” by the Chinese Khrushchev; in our view, it is ugly, ugly indeed! Look, those emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, moving slowly and awkwardly, twisting and turning, aren't they all ugly and stinky from the soul to the body?! Their so-called art of taking measured steps and waving long sleeves, can it still be used unchanged today to serve us and portray the heroic images of our broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers? No, absolutely not! The Chinese Khrushchev, ignoring the political content, uses the excuse of discussing artistic level to fawn over the dead and foreigners, and desperately peddles the black goods of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism. This makes it clear that his artistic criticism standards completely belong to the decaying and corrupt exploiting class.

Chairman Mao points out: “The more reactionary the content of a work, the more artistic it is, the more it can poison the people, and the more it should be rejected.” The Chinese Khrushchev, regarding the traitorous *The Four Generals Visit Their Mother*, the obscene *The Dragon Plays with the Phoenix*, and similar bad plays, and films like *The Last Emperor* that promote treason and *The Life of Wu Xun* that promote slavery, not only does not reject them but sings their praises and goes to great lengths to protect them, preventing the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers from criticizing them. This further exposes the Chinese Khrushchev's ferocious anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line.

Chairman Mao says: “Social practice and its effects are the criteria for testing subjective wishes or motives.” Facts are the best proof.

Over the more than ten years since liberation, the literary and artistic circles have been all about discussing and performing famous, foreign, and ancient works, and promoting feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism. This has led to the socialist stage being dominated by the dead and foreigners, while the masters of the country, the workers, peasants, and soldiers, have no place on the stage. Who is to blame for this? It is none other than the Chinese Khrushchev!

The capitalist roaders within our commune's party have, in the past, dared to seize control of the rural cultural front, enthusiastically promoting feudal and capitalist art, specially inviting the Mei Opera Troupe to perform *The Four Generals Visit Their Mother*, *The Execution at the Gate*, and other “ancient costumes dramas,” and even providing good food and drink for some bourgeois “experts” and “authorities,” respectfully inviting them to poison us poor and lower-middle peasants. Their black masters and backers are none other than the Chinese Khrushchev!

Our commune's old amateur drama troupe, under the control of the literary and artistic black line, advocated that artistic standards come first, spreading bourgeois literary and artistic thoughts such as “to win the jade in front of people, one must shed tears behind their back,” and gathering a group of so-called “artistically talented” people to openly perform *The Marriage of the Flowers* and other low-level, obscene, and flirtatious old and bad plays like “Zhang San Chases the Boat” and “Li Si Chases the Boat.” This poisoned some young people, with a few even becoming corrupt and falling into crime. The root cause of all this is none other than the Chinese Khrushchev!

The Chinese Khrushchev is a wolf in sheep's clothing. The bourgeois artistic criticism standards he advocates are actually a soft knife that kills without blood. He talks about bourgeois artistic techniques for bourgeois political purposes. In a word, he tries every means to lead our artistic criticism astray, attempting to make us unable to distinguish right from wrong, good from bad, and abandon the struggle against the bourgeoisie. This way, they can use the literary and artistic front to spread poison and conquer hearts, realizing their evil plot to restore capitalism.

    “美得很”与“丑得很”
    ——斥中国赫鲁晓夫反动的文艺批评标准
    北京市海淀区上庄人民公社　谈慧
    中国赫鲁晓夫曾经大肆宣扬：“看《天鹅湖》可以提高兴致，《巴黎圣母院》的艺术水平也很高”，“京剧艺术水平很高，不能轻视，不能乱改”，“《四郎探母》唱唱也不要紧么！”他还污蔑现代文艺“在艺术水平上讲，不如封建时代的高”。真是一派胡言，反动透顶。
    毛主席教导我们：“各个阶级社会中的各个阶级都有不同的政治标准和不同的艺术标准。”封建地主阶级和资产阶级的旧文艺，在中国赫鲁晓夫看来是“美”的，“有艺术水平”，“美得很”；在我们贫下中农看来，是丑的，丑得很！你看，那些帝王将相、才子佳人，慢慢腾腾、扭扭捏捏，从灵魂到躯体难道不都是丑死了，臭死了？！他们那一套迈方步、甩长袖的所谓艺术，今天还能够原封不动地搬来为我们服务，表现我们广大工农兵英雄形象吗？不能，根本不能！中国赫鲁晓夫撇开政治内容不谈，以大谈特谈艺术水平为幌子，肉麻地吹捧死人、洋人，拚命地兜售封、资、修的黑货，这就不难看出，他的文艺批评标准完全是属于没落腐朽的剥削阶级的。
    毛主席指出：“内容愈反动的作品而又愈带艺术性，就愈能毒害人民，就愈应该排斥。”中国赫鲁晓夫对于歌颂汉奸叛徒的《四郎探母》、黄色下流的《游龙戏凤》之类的坏戏，对于宣扬卖国主义的《清宫秘史》、宣扬奴隶主义的《武训传》之类的坏电影，不但不加以排斥，反而大唱赞歌，千方百计地庇护它们，不让广大工农兵对其进行批判，这就进一步暴露了中国赫鲁晓夫猖狂反党反社会主义以及反对毛主席革命文艺路线的丑恶面目。
    毛主席说：“社会实践及其效果是检验主观愿望或动机的标准。”事实是最好的证明。
    解放十多年来，文艺界大谈大演名、洋、古，大捧特捧封、资、修，使得社会主义的文艺舞台被死人、洋人统治着，国家的主人工农兵反而在舞台上无立足之地。其罪魁祸首是谁？不是别人，正是中国赫鲁晓夫！
    我们公社党内的走资派，过去敢于霸占农村文化阵地，热心提倡封建主义和资本主义文艺，专门请来梅剧团演出《四郎探母》、《辕门斩子》等“古装大戏”，还为某些资产阶级的臭“专家”、“权威”们准备了好吃好喝，恭恭敬敬地拱手请他们向我们贫下中农大放其毒。他们的黑主子、黑后台不是别人，正是中国赫鲁晓夫！
    我们公社的旧业余剧团，过去在文艺黑线控制下鼓吹艺术标准第一，散布“要得人前夺翠，就要人后流泪”等一系列资产阶级的文艺思想，网罗一些所谓有“艺术才能”的人，凑在一起，公开演出《花为媒》以及什么“张三追舟”“李四追舟”等低级下流、打情骂俏的旧戏、坏戏，使得一些青年中毒，个别人甚至腐化堕落，走上犯罪的道路。其总根子不是别人，就是中国赫鲁晓夫！
    中国赫鲁晓夫是一只披着羊皮的恶狼。他所鼓吹的艺术第一的资产阶级文艺批评标准，实际上是一把杀人不见血的软刀子。他谈的是资产阶级的艺术技巧，为的是资产阶级的政治目的。一句话，他千方百计地要把我们的文艺批评引向邪门歪道，妄图使我们辨不清是非，分不出美丑，放弃对资产阶级的批判斗争，以便让他们利用文艺阵地散布毒素，征服人心，实现其复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。
