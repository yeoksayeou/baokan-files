	Resolutely Oppose the Rahman Puppet Group's Criminal Acts of Shifting the Crisis
	Malayan Rubber Workers Rise Up in Protest
	Uruguayan and Chilean Workers and Students Strike and Boycott to Protest the Reactionary Government's Exploitation Policies

	According to reports from Singapore newspapers, 150 representatives of rubber workers from five rubber plantations in Selangor, Malaya, held a demonstration in Kuala Lumpur on April 30, strongly protesting against the so-called "New Rubber Agreement" forcibly implemented by the "Malaysia" Rahman puppet group, which further intensified the persecution and exploitation of Malayan rubber workers.

	The emotionally charged protesting workers held up banners reading "Against Persecution, Against Exploitation," "Smash the Blood-Sucking 'New Rubber Agreement,'" and other slogans, continuously chanting battle cries. In a protest letter handed to the Rahman puppet group, they pointed out: The so-called "New Rubber Agreement" forcibly implemented is entirely in the interest of foreign monopolistic capital. It will put 270,000 Malayan rubber workers in a situation of increased labor intensity, reduced wages, and potential dismissal, while also causing about 54,000 rubber workers to face unemployment.

	The Rahman puppet group dispatched a large number of "riot control teams" in an attempt to suppress the rubber workers' just actions.

	On the same day, in many places in the Kuala Lumpur urban area, rubber workers distributed "Letters to Fellow Citizens," calling on rubber workers to unite and smash the "New Rubber Agreement" and all unreasonable work systems, and to struggle for improved working conditions.

	The "New Rubber Agreement" concocted by the Rahman group in March this year has been in effect since April 15 and will last for three years. The Rahman group also invoked the fascist "Industrial Relations Ordinance" in an attempt to prevent rubber workers from taking strike actions.

	For more than half a month, rubber workers across Malaya, undeterred by the threats of the reactionary government, have taken various actions to resolutely oppose the Rahman group's attempts to shift the economic crisis onto the workers through oppressive measures. On April 17, rubber workers in the Seremban area of Negeri Sembilan held a one-day protest strike. Subsequently, rubber workers in Malacca, Negeri Sembilan, and other states also took protest actions. Rubber workers also condemned the Rahman group's puppet organization, the "National Plantation Workers Union," for betraying workers' interests and accepting the so-called "New Rubber Agreement" behind the workers' backs.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, 200,000 workers in the fuel, electricity, and postal sectors of Uruguay held a 24-hour strike on April 26, demanding wage increases and improved living conditions.

	At the same time, 8,000 dock workers in Montevideo, Uruguay, also went on strike on April 24, protesting the government's arbitrary dismissal of workers.

	Due to the Uruguayan government's implementation of the plundering policies of the U.S.-controlled International Monetary Fund, Uruguay's economy is deteriorating, and living costs are soaring. Since the beginning of this year, workers in many industries in Uruguay have gone on strike to demand wage increases.

	In Chile, more than 200,000 middle school students went on strike on April 26 to support teachers' legitimate demands for wage increases.

　　马来亚橡胶工人奋起示威
　　乌拉圭和智利工人学生罢工罢课抗议反动当局的压榨政策
    新华社二日讯　据新加坡报纸报道，马来亚雪兰莪州五个橡胶园的橡胶工人代表一百五十人，四月三十日在吉隆坡举行示威，强烈抗议“马来西亚”拉赫曼傀儡集团强行实施所谓“胶业新合约”，变本加厉地迫害和剥削马来亚橡胶工人。
    情绪激昂的示威工人举着“反迫害，反剥削”、“粉碎吸血的‘胶业新合约’”等横幅标语，不断高呼战斗口号。他们在交给拉赫曼傀儡集团的一份抗议书中指出：强行实施的所谓“胶业新合约”完全是为外国垄断资本的利益服务的，它将使马来亚二十七万名橡胶工人面临增加劳动强度、削减工资和被开除的处境，同时将使大约五万四千名橡胶工人面临失业。
    拉赫曼傀儡集团派出大批“镇暴队”，企图镇压橡胶工人的正义行动。
    同一天，在吉隆坡市区的许多地方出现了橡胶工人散发的“告同胞书”，号召橡胶工人团结一致，粉碎“胶业新合约”和一切不合理的工作制度，争取改善工作条件。
    拉赫曼傀儡集团在今年三月间炮制的“胶业新合约”已从四月十五日开始实施，为期三年。拉赫曼集团还搬出法西斯的“工业关系法令”，妄图阻止橡胶工人采取罢工行动。
    半个多月来，马来亚各地的橡胶工人不顾反动当局的恫吓，纷纷采取行动，坚决反对拉赫曼集团妄图将经济危机转嫁到工人身上的迫害措施。森美兰州西里安橡胶工人在四月十七日举行了一天的抗议罢工，随后，马六甲、森美兰等州的橡胶工人也分别采取了抗议行动。橡胶工人还谴责拉赫曼集团的御用工具“全国种植职工总会”的工贼头子出卖工人利益，背着工人接受拉赫曼傀儡集团的所谓“胶业新合约”。
    新华社讯　乌拉圭燃料、电力、邮电等行业的二十万职工，四月二十六日举行二十四小时罢工，要求增加工资和改善生活待遇。
    与此同时，乌拉圭蒙得维的亚港的八千名码头工人二十四日也举行罢工，抗议当局无理解雇工人。
    由于乌拉圭当局执行美国控制的国际货币基金组织的掠夺政策，乌拉圭的经济日益恶化，生活费用猛涨。今年以来，乌拉圭许多行业的工人先后举行罢工，要求增加工资。
    在智利，二十多万中学生二十六日举行罢课，支持教师的增加工资的正当要求。
