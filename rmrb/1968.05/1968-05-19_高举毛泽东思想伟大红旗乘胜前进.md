The great leader Chairman Mao personally directed the formulation of the May 16 Circular issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966. Two years have passed since this brilliant, epoch-making document was published. Under its radiant guidance, the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Hubei have achieved decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the situation is getting better and better. Mao Zedong Thought has never been so widely spread as it is today; Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has never been so deeply rooted in people's hearts as it is today; the 32 million heroic people of Hubei have never been so full of vigor and enthusiasm as they are today; revolutionary committees have been established in all prefectures and in more than 80% of the counties, and the dictatorship of the proletariat has never been so consolidated as it is today. With Chairman Mao leading and steering, it is the greatest happiness and greatest glory for us poor and lower-middle peasants and the people of the whole country. We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, sincerely wish our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao a long, long life! Long live Chairman Mao!

Recently, Chairman Mao pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes in the condition of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the revolutionary masses it leads and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." This brilliant new directive by Chairman Mao most profoundly elucidates the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, most penetratingly reveals the class content of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and once again points out the direction for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. To carry this political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes through to the end, we must repeatedly study the May 16 Circular issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966, deeply understand, and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's series of latest directives. We must carry forward the spirit of thorough and resolute revolution of the proletariat, further raise the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the proletariat, resolutely oppose right opportunism, right capitulationism, and right splittism, and thoroughly smash the right opportunist reversal-of-verdicts wind. We must firmly grasp the direction of struggle, carry out in-depth and prolonged revolutionary criticism, thoroughly expose and criticize the traitor, spy, and counter-revolutionary elements hiding within, and bring out the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party like Liu Shaoqi and their agents in Hubei like Wang Renzhong, fight them down, and make them stink. We must heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, continually analyze new problems arising in the movement, closely watch the movements of the class enemy, study their tactics, take the initiative to attack, fight continuously, fight accurately, fight fiercely, fight steadily, and fight them to the point where they are utterly defeated and have nowhere to hide. We must strictly distinguish between contradictions among the people and those between ourselves and the enemy, "be united with our own people, with the people, with comrades, with superiors, and with subordinates," and under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, unite the vast majority of cadres and masses into a mighty revolutionary army, jointly fight against the enemy, and isolate the handful of class enemies to the greatest extent. In a word, studying the great May 16 Circular means to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, ride the victorious momentum of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and launch a fierce attack on the handful of class enemies, resolutely defend the dictatorship of the proletariat. Let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high forever in the whole of China and the whole world!

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗乘胜前进
    全国农业劳动模范  湖北省革命委员会副主任  饶兴礼
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》发表两周年了。在这一光芒四射的划时代的伟大历史文献的光辉指引下，湖北无产阶级革命派和广大工农兵群众，夺得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利，形势越来越好。毛泽东思想从来没有象今天这样空前大普及；毛主席的无产阶级革命路线从来没有象今天这样深入人心；湖北三千二百万英雄儿女从来没有象今天这样朝气蓬勃，斗志昂扬；全省所有专区和百分之八十以上的县都成立了革命委员会，无产阶级专政从来没有象今天这样巩固。有毛主席领导和掌舵，是我们贫下中农和全国人民的最大幸福、最大光荣。我们广大贫下中农从心底里千遍万遍地祝愿我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席他老人家最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席这一光辉的最新指示，最深刻地阐明了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，最精辟地揭示了无产阶级文化大革命的阶级内容，又一次为我们指明了无产阶级文化大革命的航向。为了把无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的这场政治大革命进行到底，我们一定要反复学习中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》，深刻领会、坚决贯彻毛主席的一系列最新指示。我们要发扬无产阶级的坚决彻底革命精神，进一步提高无产阶级的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾投降主义、右倾分裂主义，彻底粉碎右倾翻案妖风。我们要牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，深入持久地开展革命大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在湖北地区代理人王任重之流揭深批透，斗倒斗臭，把隐藏的叛徒、特务和反革命分子挖出来。我们要百倍提高革命警惕性，不断分析运动中出现的新问题，密切注视阶级敌人的动向，研究他们的策略，主动进攻，连续作战，打得准，打得狠，打得稳，打得他们一败涂地，无处藏身。我们要严格区分敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，“对自己人、对人民、对同志、对官长、对部下要和，要团结”，使绝大多数干部和群众在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，汇成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，共同对敌，把一小撮阶级敌人最大限度地孤立起来。一句话，学习伟大的《通知》，就是要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，乘无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利的东风，向一小撮阶级敌人继续发动猛烈进攻，誓死捍卫无产阶级专政。让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在全中国、全世界高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
