Syria's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mahus on the 8th in Damascus condemned the Tunisian reactionary government and the United States for standing together and abruptly announcing the "severance of diplomatic relations" with Syria.

Mahus said, "At a time when the Arab nation needs to unite to confront common enemies, Tunisia is strengthening its relations with the United States and West Germany, and severing relations with an Arab country."

According to reports, the Tunisian reactionary government, on the pretext of the Syrian diplomatic mission in Tunisia "violating etiquette and diplomatic conventions," abruptly and unreasonably announced the "severance of diplomatic relations" with Syria on the 7th. The Chargé d'Affaires of the Syrian Embassy in Tunisia has left Tunisia and returned to the country on the 10th.

Mahus said, "Tunisia's attitude proves to the Arab people that it is impossible for any country to oppose the Israeli regime while also being a friend of imperialism." He said, "The Arab people will continue to advance."

Mahus pointed out: "Our hearts will forever be with the people of Tunisia, despite the Bourguiba regime's attempt to isolate the Tunisian people from the Arab nation." He said, "During the period of the U.S.-Israeli aggression against Arab countries last year, the actions of the Tunisian people themselves proved that their fate is linked to the cause of the Arab nation."

    叙利亚副总理兼外长
    谴责突尼斯悍然同叙利亚断交
    据新华社十日讯　叙利亚副总理兼外交部长马胡斯八日在大马士革谴责突尼斯反动政府和美国站在一起，悍然宣布同叙利亚“断绝外交关系”。
    马胡斯说，正当阿拉伯民族需要一致努力来对付共同敌人的时候，突尼斯却加强它同美国和西德的关系，而同一个阿拉伯国家断绝关系。
    据报道，突尼斯反动政府七日在叙利亚驻突尼斯外交使团“违反礼节和外交惯例”的借口下，悍然无理宣布同叙利亚“断绝外交关系”。叙利亚驻突尼斯大使馆代办已于十日离开突尼斯回国。
    马胡斯说，突尼斯的态度向阿拉伯人民证明，任何国家要想表示同以色列政权对立同时又做帝国主义的朋友，这是不可能的。他说，阿拉伯人民将继续前进。
    马胡斯指出：“我们的心将永远同突尼斯人民在一起，尽管布尔吉巴政权企图把突尼斯人民同阿拉伯民族隔离开来。”他说，在去年美以侵略阿拉伯国家期间，突尼斯人民的行动本身，证明了他们的命运是同阿拉伯民族的事业联系在一起的。
