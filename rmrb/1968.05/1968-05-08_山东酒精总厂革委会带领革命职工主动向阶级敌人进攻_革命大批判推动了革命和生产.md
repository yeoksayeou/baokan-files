The Revolutionary Committee of Shandong Alcohol Factory, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "never forget class struggle," has overcome complacency and underestimation, leading all revolutionary workers in the factory to carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, actively launching an offensive against class enemies. This has effectively struck down the class enemies, promoting the revolution and production in the entire factory.

In February this year, shortly after the establishment of the factory's Revolutionary Committee, the revolutionary and production situation in the entire factory presented a very good picture. At this time, a small handful of class enemies stirred up a wave of revisionism, attempting to split the revolutionary mass organizations and undermine the newly born Revolutionary Committee. These elements, on one hand, spread counter-revolutionary fallacies behind the scenes, inciting discord and creating chaos; on the other hand, they used honey-coated bullets to win over people. The sabotage by class enemies temporarily affected the revolutionary unity and revolutionary criticism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never reconcile themselves to their defeat. They will still make their last struggles. Even after the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways. They will try every day and every moment to restore their rule in China. This is inevitable and beyond doubt. We must never relax our vigilance." Chairman Mao's great teachings, like a guiding light, made the members of the factory's Revolutionary Committee see clearly. They realized that the seizure of power from the capitalist roaders by the proletarian revolutionary faction does not mean that their political and ideological power has been seized. The wave of revisionism in the factory is a reflection of the current class struggle and must be analyzed and handled from the perspective of class struggle. It is necessary to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, and never stop attacking the class enemies.

After the members of the factory's Revolutionary Committee unified their thinking, they went to the workshops and teams, worked and studied with the workers, and recalled bitterness and compared the past with the present. Through study, discussion, and recalling bitterness, the broad revolutionary masses enhanced their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, loved Chairman Mao even more, and hated China's Khrushchev even more. The broad workers fiercely exposed the current class struggle in the factory and the workshop, launching a fierce attack on the class enemies. The members of the factory's Revolutionary Committee who were stationed in the machinery repair workshop, relying on the revolutionary masses, exposed a rightist element who was spreading rumors behind the scenes, fanning the flames, and collaborating with the capitalist roaders in the factory to carry out restoration activities, attempting to reverse his own case. This rightist element conspired to sabotage revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, and to sabotage production. The members of the factory's Revolutionary Committee led everyone in the workshop to expose, criticize, and struggle against this rightist element, and announced this bad element's crimes to the entire factory. They held a factory-wide meeting to expose and struggle against this rightist element and the capitalist roaders in the factory. These negative examples sounded the alarm and gave everyone a vivid lesson in class struggle. The eyes of the broad revolutionary masses became brighter, and their revolutionary vigilance became higher.

While criticizing and struggling against the class enemies in the factory, the Revolutionary Committee paid great attention to linking it with the criticism of China's Khrushchev's crimes. They linked it with the actual situation in the factory, fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev's theory of "the extinction of class struggle" and "exploitation is meritorious."

Now, the revolution in this factory is booming, and production is thriving. The situation is getting better and better. Since late February, the daily input volume has increased by 10 percent compared to the past.

　　山东酒精总厂革委会带领革命职工主动向阶级敌人进攻
　　革命大批判推动了革命和生产
    据新华社济南七日电　山东酒精总厂革委会遵照伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，克服麻痹轻敌思想，带领全厂革命职工深入持久地开展革命大批判，主动向阶级敌人进攻，有力地打击了阶级敌人，推动了全厂的革命和生产。
    今年二月，厂革委会成立后不久，全厂革命和生产呈现出一派大好形势。这时候，一小撮阶级敌人刮起了一股翻案妖风，妄图分裂革命群众组织，搞垮新诞生的革委会。这些家伙一方面在背后散布反革命的谬论，挑拨离间，制造混乱；一方面施放糖衣炮弹，进行拉拢。阶级敌人的破坏，一时影响了革命大联合和革命大批判。
    毛主席教导说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”毛主席的伟大教导，象指路明灯，使厂革委会的成员豁然开朗。他们认识到，无产阶级革命派在组织上夺了走资派的权，并不等于从政治上、思想上夺了他们的权。厂里刮起的这股翻案妖风，正是当前阶级斗争的反映，必须用阶级斗争的观点去分析、去处理，必须更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入持久地开展革命大批判，一刻也不停顿地向阶级敌人进攻。
    厂革委会成员思想认识统一后，他们分头到车间班组，同工人一起劳动，一起学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，一起忆苦思甜和回忆对比。通过学习、讨论和忆苦思甜，广大革命群众提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，更加热爱毛主席，更加仇恨中国赫鲁晓夫。广大职工狠揭本厂、本车间当前阶级斗争的盖子，向阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻。在机修车间蹲点的厂革委会成员，依靠革命群众，揭发了一个右派分子在背后煽阴风，点鬼火，配合厂里走资派大搞复辟活动，妄图为自己翻案的罪行。这个右派分子阴谋破坏革命大联合和革命三结合，阴谋破坏生产。厂革委会成员领导大家在车间对这个右派分子进行了大揭发、大批判、大斗争，并且把这个坏家伙的罪行向全厂公布，举行全厂大会，揭发、斗争了这个右派分子和厂里的走资派。这些反面教员，给大家敲了警钟，上了一堂生动的阶级斗争课。广大革命群众的眼睛越来越亮，革命警惕性越来越高。
    厂革委会在批判、斗争本厂的阶级敌人时，很注意同批判中国赫鲁晓夫的罪行挂钩。他们联系本厂实际，痛批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“剥削有功”论。
    现在，这个厂革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产搞得热气腾腾，形势越来越好。从二月下旬以来，每日投料量比过去增长了百分之十。
