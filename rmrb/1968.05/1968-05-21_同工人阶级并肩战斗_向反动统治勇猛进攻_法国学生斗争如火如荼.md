Since May, the struggle of French students against the decadent education system and the government's bloody suppression of the student movement has surged to unprecedented heights, sweeping across major cities nationwide and shaking the entire country.

The French ruling class, in order to suppress the students' just struggle, closed the University of Paris on May 3 and arbitrarily arrested over 500 university students. Subsequently, they dispatched tens of thousands of police, gendarmes, and security forces over several days, using tear gas, tear gas grenades, and concussion grenades to brutally suppress the demonstrating students and teachers, injuring and arresting over 2,000 people. The fascist atrocities of the police have sparked the students' indignation. Starting from May 3, over the past ten days, tens of thousands of Paris students have taken to the streets daily for demonstrations and marches, with the tide of struggle rising higher and higher. The students wrote on their banners: "We will use revolutionary violence to counter the violence of the bourgeoisie." They raised red flags and sang the "Internationale," their fighting spirit soaring. They erected over sixty barricades in the University of Paris area, dug up paving stones, and removed roadside railings, using makeshift Molotov cocktails to bravely counterattack the police, fully demonstrating their fearless heroism and tenacious fighting spirit.

The French students' struggle quickly spread from universities to middle schools, from Paris to the entire country, and gained the widespread support of the French people. On May 13, over 10 million French workers held a 24-hour nationwide general strike in support of the students' just struggle. Over 800,000 Paris workers, students, and teachers held a massive demonstration. On the same day, in more than ten major cities in France, workers and students fought side by side, each holding demonstrations with tens of thousands of participants.

Currently, not only have French students, teachers, and workers occupied 18 universities across the country and continued their struggle, but French workers have also begun to occupy factories, detain managers and directors, and taken more daring actions than ever before.

The French students' struggle against American imperialism is also escalating. Since this year, they have repeatedly held large-scale demonstrations to oppose American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam. During the demonstrations, students chanted slogans: "Down with American imperialism!" "American imperialism is the number one enemy of the people of the world!" They repeatedly burned the American flag and effigies of the American imperialist leader Johnson, and hoisted the flag of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the roof of the University of Paris library. Even Paris's primary and secondary school students risked arrest to write large anti-American imperialism slogans in red paint on American buildings and street walls.

    同工人阶级并肩战斗  向反动统治勇猛进攻
    法国学生斗争如火如荼
    今年五月以来，法国学生反对现行腐朽的教育制度、抗议政府血腥镇压学生运动的斗争空前高涨，席卷了全国各大城市，震动了整个法国。
    法国统治集团为了压制学生的正义斗争，五月三日封闭了巴黎大学，并无理逮捕了五百多名大学生。接着，连日出动成千上万的警察、宪兵和保安部队，使用毒气、催泪弹、震荡手榴弹等，血腥镇压示威的学生和教师，打伤和逮捕了二千多人。警察的法西斯暴行激起学生的义愤。从三日起，十多天来，成千成万的巴黎学生每天上街示威游行，斗争的怒潮一浪高于一浪。学生们在标语中写着：“我们要以革命的暴力对付资产阶级的暴力。”他们高举红旗，高唱《国际歌》，斗志昂扬。他们在巴黎大学区筑起六十多道街垒，挖起铺路的石头，拔起道旁的栏杆，使用临时制造的燃烧瓶，英勇地向警察反击，充分显示了他们不畏强暴的英雄气概和顽强的战斗精神。
    法国学生的斗争迅速从大学发展到中学，从巴黎发展到全国，得到法国人民的普遍支持。十三日，法国一千多万工人举行了二十四小时的全国总罢工，声援学生的正义斗争。巴黎工人和大中学生、教师八十多万人联合举行了声势浩大的示威游行。同一天，在法国十多个主要城市，工人和学生也在并肩战斗，分别举行了几万人的示威。
    目前，不仅法国学生、教师和工人已占领了法国全国的十八个大学，仍在坚持斗争，而且，法国的工人也纷纷开始占领工厂，扣留厂长和经理，采取了比以往更为勇敢的行动。
    法国学生反对美帝国主义的斗争也在日益高涨。今年以来，他们一再举行声势浩大的示威游行，反对美帝国主义侵略越南。在游行中，学生们高呼口号：“打倒美帝国主义！”“美帝国主义是全世界人民的头号敌人！”他们多次烧毁美国星条旗和美帝国主义头子约翰逊的模拟人像，并且在巴黎大学图书馆屋顶上升起越南民主共和国国旗。连巴黎的中小学生也冒着被捕的危险，在美国建筑物和街头墙壁上用红漆书写反对美帝国主义的大字标语。
