The vast ocean relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th" directive is a landmark development in Marxism-Leninism and a great guiding principle for our military construction. The advanced collective studying Chairman Mao's works at the General Logistics Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Tanggula Mountain Garrison, which has been fighting year-round at an altitude of over 5,200 meters, is a prominent representative of those who have grown up in the great school of Mao Zedong Thought. They are praised by passing troops as the "ice lotus."

With hearts as bright as the morning sun and aspirations as high as the sky, building a garrison on the roof of the world

The Tanggula Mountain Garrison was established in 1964. At that time, there were only four people: the political instructor, a doctor, a cook, and a soldier. They brought Chairman Mao's works and a tent to the summit of Tanggula Mountain, known as the roof of the world, at an altitude of over 5,000 meters. Upon arrival, they encountered numerous difficulties. First, they were not adapted to the climate. The high altitude, severe cold, and thin air made it hard to eat and sleep. Within a few days, some had swollen legs, and others had swollen backs. Strong winds blew the tent, and at night, if one was not careful, the blanket and hair would freeze to the wall. Faced with these severe tests, the soldiers made a firm decision: no matter how many difficulties there were, with Mao Zedong Thought, nothing was difficult. They said: the mountain is high and the air is thin, but Mao Zedong Thought supplies us with spiritual oxygen; the climate is severe, but we have an eternal red sun in our hearts. Instructor Wang Guangrong thought: to build the garrison, we must first build people, and to build people, we must first build their hearts, and to build their hearts, we rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. He opened Chairman Mao's works and, together with three comrades, read and studied them repeatedly. "What is work? Work is struggle." "Make up your mind, do not fear sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." "To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai." Great Mao Zedong Thought gave the comrades boundless strength. They said: Mao Zedong Thought has taken root in our minds, and we will firmly plant our roots on the summit of Tanggula Mountain.

After Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th" directive reached the plateau, the comrades at the garrison had a clearer direction. They decided to turn the garrison into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought and to forge every soldier into a red warrior in this great school. Comrade Yang Sizi, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, had a weak constitution and suffered greatly from altitude sickness after arriving in Tanggula. However, he worked selflessly. He said: "Comrade Zhang Zedong worked tirelessly in such a harsh environment, doing whatever the party asked without complaint. Now, I am working in such a good environment, even if it is a bit hard and tiring, what is that compared to Comrade Zhang Zedong?" Soon, he contracted pulmonary edema. The higher party committee, considering his poor adaptation to the high altitude, decided to transfer him to a lower-altitude area. When he returned from the hospital and learned of this, he repeatedly sought out the leaders and sincerely said: "I am the son of a poor peasant, a soldier of the people. If I do not work in Tanggula, who will? If I do not come here to defend the motherland, who will? Isn't fear of death the 'philosophy of survival' of China's Khrushchev?" After his repeated pleas, the leadership agreed to let him stay in Tanggula for another period.

Over the years, the soldiers of the Tanggula Mountain Garrison, with hearts infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, have used the "Three Articles" as their weapon to change people's minds and the face of nature. They built houses, walls, and forts here. Is it hard here? Indeed, it is hard. Is it cold here? Indeed, it is cold. But the soldiers say: a harsh environment can cultivate our revolutionary spirit, and a cold climate can temper our revolutionary will.

"Living in Tanggula, thinking of Beijing. Standing on the snow-capped mountain, looking at the world." This is the voice from the hearts of the Tanggula soldiers. All comrades at the Tanggula Mountain Garrison link their every mundane task with the Chinese Revolution and the world revolution, with the consolidation of the country's border defense and the proletarian dictatorship, with the defense of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the protection of the great Mao Zedong Thought. They are full of vigorous revolutionary spirit. They proudly say: standing tall in Tanggula, the roof of the world is our home, Mao Zedong Thought nurtures us, and red flowers bloom on the ice peaks.

The red light of Mao Zedong Thought shines, self-reliance brings flowers to the mountains

What kind of garrison should be built? Based on Chairman Mao's teaching that "the army should be a great school," the soldiers of Tanggula decided to turn the garrison into a red propaganda station of Mao Zedong Thought. From the courtyard to the outside, from the dining hall to the dormitory, they hung golden portraits of Chairman Mao and his quotations everywhere, so that weary travelers reaching the snowy summit of Tanggula Mountain could first bathe in the warmth of the red sun. The garrison also organized a small, efficient Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team to go to the dining hall, garage, and other places to propagate among passing personnel. Some read newspapers, some read domestic and international news just heard from the radio, and some brought drums, erhu, and performed small-scale cultural performances to propagate Chairman Mao's latest directives, making the high and icy summit of Tanggula Mountain hot and lively. Passing personnel said: "Staying at the Tanggula Garrison, not only does our stomach fill with food, but more importantly, our minds fill with Mao Zedong Thought." "The Tanggula Mountain Garrison is located in the snow mountains, but everywhere is filled with the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought."

Although this place was once called a "biological prohibition zone" and a "barren land" by some, the party branch of the garrison drew infinite strength from Chairman Mao's great teaching of "engaging in agricultural and sideline production" and decided to let the spirit of self-reliance shine brightly on Tanggula Mountain. With no fuel, they mobilized everyone to collect cow dung from the mountains as fuel; with no fresh vegetables, they organized comrades to hunt wild sheep, dig wild onions, grow bean sprouts, raise pigs, and catch fish. Fishing is seasonal and can usually only be done in June and July. In June and July, the water in Tanggula Mountain is still icy cold. To catch fish, the comrades, despite the cold and fatigue, set out before dawn and returned home at eight or nine in the evening. Going into the river, their legs were numb from the cold, but they sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations and persisted. In 1964, when the garrison was just established, they bought four pigs, but all died within a year. In 1965, they still failed to raise any. In 1966, they bought four more, but within a short time, two died again. At this time, someone concluded: "Pigs cannot be raised on Tanggula Mountain." The comrades repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "May 7th" directive, drew lessons from failures, improved breeding methods, and finally raised the remaining two pigs, which grew very well.

In the great school of Mao Zedong Thought, the spirit of "complete," "thorough," and "serving the people" is fully displayed. Tanggula is a small station, and usually, only the midday meal is provided for passing convoys. The garrison would prepare the best menu for midday. Sometimes, convoys would arrive unexpectedly, and they would proactively give their meals to the passing troops and eat leftovers or prepare something else. The comrades said: "If we can let the comrades in the convoy eat well, we are genuinely happy."

At the beginning of this year, the Tanggula Mountain region was snowed in, blocking the convoys. From mid-January to mid-February, for over twenty days, the number of people eating each day was around two to three hundred, but the entire garrison had only seven people. However, difficulties could not defeat the soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Deputy Instructor Shen Peifu and the others studied the "Three Articles" together, and Chairman Mao's teachings gave them boundless strength. Shen Peifu always fought in the kitchen. After twenty days of intense work, they successfully completed their mission.

Criticizing selfishness and revisionism as pioneers, a red heart for the people

The soldiers of the Tanggula Mountain Garrison, living on the snow-capped mountain but thinking of Beijing, followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "participating in the cultural revolution to criticize the bourgeoisie" during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, deep hatred for the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, and burning hatred for China's Khrushchev, they took up their pens and joined the battlefield of revolutionary criticism. Everyone participated, and everyone spoke, writing articles and drawing cartoons, launching a people's war to criticize the bourgeoisie on the summit of Tanggula Mountain. The garrison held eight meetings to criticize the number one capitalist roader within the party, and everyone was eager to fight, filled with indignation. They said: "A thousand evils, ten thousand evils, the greatest evil is China's Khrushchev opposing Mao Zedong Thought; a thousand hatreds, ten thousand hatreds, China's Khrushchev is our sworn enemy." To thoroughly expose the "revolutionary" mask of the number one capitalist roader within the party and further expose China's Khrushchev's heinous crimes of opposing Mao Zedong Thought, the garrison also organized comrades to conduct reminiscence and comparison activities, greatly raising the class consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the comrades.

In the Mao Zedong Thought study class, the cadres and soldiers of the Tanggula Mountain Garrison took the lead in exposing and criticizing their selfishness. When they first arrived, they all had varying degrees of altitude sickness, and some had fleeting selfish thoughts, fearing hardship and fearing that long-term work would ruin their health. Aiming at these problems, the comrades consciously linked the criticism of selfishness with the criticism of revisionism in their studies, fiercely fighting against the "self" and deeply uprooting the "revisionist" roots. Many comrades used their long-term persistence in Tanggula Mountain as facts to fiercely criticize China's Khrushchev's theory of "merging public and private interests," establishing a shining "public" in their minds and a red "loyalty" to the great leader Chairman Mao.

The officers and soldiers of the Tanggula Mountain Garrison, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "engaging in mass work," opened night schools for the local transport station and road maintenance crew's Tibetan compatriots, helping them study Chairman Mao's works, learn to sing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, and learn cultural knowledge. The cadres, doctors, and soldiers of the garrison took turns teaching in the night school. Tibetan compatriots who previously could not read now can recite the "Three Articles." Songs of Chairman Mao's quotations have become their favorite songs, and Chairman Mao's latest directives have become their actual actions. The Tanggula Mountain Garrison is located in a Tibetan area, and the medical staff of the garrison are very concerned about the sufferings of the Tibetan compatriots, often crossing mountains and valleys to treat them dozens of miles away. Once, doctors Wang Fengtan and nurse Zhou Fangbing gave birth to a woman in a nearby road maintenance crew, working late into the night before returning to the garrison. The comrades in the road maintenance crew were moved and said: "You are truly good soldiers of Chairman Mao."

### 唐古拉山顶的新天地——记沿着“五·七”指示光辉道路前进的唐古拉山兵站

　　唐古拉山顶的新天地
　　——记沿着“五·七”指示光辉道路前进的唐古拉山兵站
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示，是马克思列宁主义划时代的新发展，是我军建设的伟大指针。中国人民解放军总后勤部学习毛主席著作先进集体，常年奋战在海拔五千二百米的唐古拉山上的唐古拉山兵站，就是在毛泽东思想大学校里成长起来的一个突出的代表。他们被过往部队誉为“冰山雪莲”。
    胸怀朝阳志冲天　世界屋脊建兵站
    唐古拉山兵站是一九六四年建立起来的。当时只有四个人：指导员、医生、一个炊事员和一个战士。他们带着毛主席著作和一顶帐篷，来到海拔五千多米、被称为世界屋脊的唐古拉山顶上。刚到这里，就遇到了一大堆困难。首先是气候不适应，海拔高，气候严寒，空气稀薄，饭吃不下，觉睡不好。不到几天，有的腿肿了，有的背肿了。大风吹来，帐篷随风飘，晚上睡觉稍微不注意，被子和头发就会被冰沾在墙上。在严峻的考验面前，战士们下定决心：千困难，万困难，有了毛泽东思想就不难。大家说：山高缺氧，有毛泽东思想供给我们思想上的氧；气候严寒，我们心中有颗永远不落的红太阳。指导员王光荣同志想：建站必须先建人，建人必须先建心，建心靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他打开了毛主席著作，和三个同志围在一起，反复读，反复领会。“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。”“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”。伟大的毛泽东思想给了同志们无穷的力量。大家说：毛泽东思想在我们头脑里扎了根，我们要把根子牢牢地扎在唐古拉山顶上。
    毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示传到高原后，兵站同志建站的方向更加明确了。他们决心把兵站办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，把每个战士炼成大学校里的红色战士。学习毛主席著作积极分子杨四子同志身体本来就不太好，到唐古拉后高山反应较大，可是他一直忘我地工作。他说：“张思德同志在那样艰苦的环境下，工作不讲价钱，党叫干啥就干啥，我现在在这样好的环境下工作，就是苦一点，累一点，和张思德同志比起来又算得了什么？”不久，他得了肺水肿，上级党委考虑到他身体不适应在唐古拉工作，决定调他到海拔低一点的地方。当他住院回来知道这件事以后，多次找领导谈，他诚恳地说：“我是贫农的儿子，是人民子弟兵，我不在唐古拉工作，谁在唐古拉工作？我不来这里保卫祖国，谁来这里保卫祖国？怕死，不正是中国赫鲁晓夫的‘活命哲学’吗！”经他再三恳求，领导上答应他在唐古拉再留一个时期。
    几年来，唐古拉山兵站的战士，就是凭着一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，以“老三篇”为武器，在改变着人的思想，改变着大自然的面貌。他们在这里修起了一幢幢房屋，打起了围墙，筑起了碉堡。这里艰苦吗？的确艰苦。这里寒冷吗？的确寒冷。但是战士们说：“艰苦的环境，可以培养我们的革命精神，寒冷的气候，可以锻炼我们的革命意志。”
    “身居唐古拉，心向北京城。站在雪山顶，放眼全世界。”这是发自唐古拉战士内心的声音。唐古拉山兵站的全体同志，把自己每一件平凡的工作，同中国革命和世界革命紧紧地联系在一起，同巩固祖国边防和巩固无产阶级专政紧紧地联系在一起，同保卫无产阶级文化大革命和捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想紧紧地联系在一起。他们浑身充满着旺盛的革命干劲。他们自豪地说：昂首挺胸唐古拉，世界屋脊是我家，毛泽东思想哺育咱，冰山绝顶开红花。
　　毛泽东思想红光闪　自力更生花满山
    兵站应该办成什么样子？唐古拉战士根据毛主席“军队应该是一个大学校”的教导，决心把兵站办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想宣传站。他们从院里到院外，从食堂到宿舍，到处挂上了金光闪闪的毛主席像和毛主席语录，使跋山涉水、风尘仆仆的过往人员到达风雪唐古拉山顶后，首先沐浴着红太阳的温暖。兵站还组织了一个精干的毛泽东思想宣传队，深入食堂、车场，向过往人员进行宣传。有的读报纸，有的给大家宣读刚从收音机里听到的国内外新闻，有的带上锣鼓、胡琴，举行小型文艺演出，宣传毛主席的最新指示，把高入云天、千里冰封的唐古拉山顶搞得热火朝天。过往人员说：“住唐古拉兵站，不光肚子里增加了食粮，更重要的是脑子里增加了毛泽东思想。”“唐古拉山兵站地处雪山，但到处都充满着毛泽东思想的阳光。”
    尽管这里曾被一些人称为“生物禁区”和“不毛之地”，但兵站党支部从毛主席“又能从事农副业生产”的伟大教导中吸取了无穷的力量，决心让自力更生的精神在唐古拉山上大放光芒。没有烧的，发动大家漫山遍野拾牛粪作燃料；没有新鲜菜，组织同志们打野羊，挖野葱，生豆芽，养猪，打鱼。打鱼这项工作，季节性很强，一般只能在六、七月份进行。六、七月的唐古拉山，水还是冰冷刺骨。为了打鱼，同志们不顾寒冷和疲劳，天不亮出发，晚上八、九点钟才回家。下到河里冻得两腿麻木，大家一边高唱毛主席语录歌，一边坚持干。一九六四年，兵站刚建立的时候，买了四头猪，不到一年都死掉了。一九六五年还是没有养活。一九六六年又买了四头，在很短的时间里又连续死了两头。这时有人得出结论：“唐古拉山上养不活猪”。同志们一次次学习毛主席的“五·七”指示，从失败中总结了经验教训，改进了饲养方法，终于把剩下的两头猪养活了，而且长得很好。
    在毛泽东思想大学校里，“完全”“彻底”“为人民服务”的精神大发扬。唐古拉是个小站，一般车队只在这里吃中午饭。兵站就把最好的食谱订在中午。有时车队临时来到，他们就主动把站上人员的饭菜让给过往部队吃，自己另作或吃点剩饭。同志们说：“能让车队的同志们吃饱、吃好，我们打心眼里感到高兴。”
    今年初，唐古拉山地区大雪封山，车队受阻，从一月下旬到二月中旬，二十多天的时间里，每天就餐人员都在二、三百人左右，全站干部、战士总共只有七人。但是，困难难不倒用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士。副指导员沈培法同志和大家一起学习“老三篇”，毛主席的教导给大家增添了无穷无尽的力量。沈培法同志一直战斗在炊事班里，经过二十天的紧张工作，他们圆满地完成了任务。
    斗私批修当闯将  一颗红心为人民
    唐古拉山兵站的战士，身在雪山顶，心向北京城。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们遵照毛主席“要随时参加批判资产阶级的文化革命斗争”的教导，怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的阶级感情，带着对党内最大的一小撮走资派的深仇大恨，提笔上阵，冲上了革命大批判的战场，人人动手，个个开口，写文章，画漫画，在唐古拉山顶展开了一场批判资产阶级的“人民战争”。站上召开了八次批判党内头号走资派的大会，同志们个个摩拳擦掌，义愤填膺。他们说：“千罪恶，万罪恶，中国赫鲁晓夫反对毛泽东思想是最大的罪恶；千仇恨，万仇恨，中国赫鲁晓夫是我们不共戴天的最大仇人。”为了彻底戳穿党内头号走资派的“老革命”画皮，进一步揭发中国赫鲁晓夫反对毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，兵站还组织同志们开展了回忆对比活动，极大地提高了同志们的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。
    在毛泽东思想学习班里，唐古拉山兵站的干部、战士带头亮私、斗私。他们初到这里，都不同程度地有过高山反应，一些同志曾有一闪而过的私心杂念，有的怕艰苦，有的怕干长了把身体搞垮。针对这些问题，同志们在学习中自觉地把斗私和批修联系起来，狠斗“私”字，猛挖“修”根。许多同志用自己长期坚持在唐古拉山的事实，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“公私溶化”论，在头脑里树起了一个闪闪发光的“公”字，树起了一个对伟大领袖毛主席的红彤彤的“忠”字。
    唐古拉山兵站的指战员，遵照毛主席“从事群众工作”的伟大教导，给依邻而居的地方运输站和道班里的藏胞开办了夜校，帮助藏胞学习毛主席著作，学唱毛主席语录歌，学文化知识。站里的干部、医生、战士分别在夜校里担任教员。从前不识字的藏胞，现在已能背“老三篇”。毛主席语录歌成了他们最爱唱的歌曲，毛主席的最新指示变成了他们的实际行动。唐古拉山兵站地处藏族地区，兵站医务人员十分关心藏胞疾苦，常常翻山越岭到几十里地以外去为藏胞看病。有一次，医生王风坦和卫生员周方丙同志，给附近道班的一个产妇接生，忙到深夜才回站。道班上的同志们感动地说：“你们真是毛主席的好战士。”
