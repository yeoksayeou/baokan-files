Jacques Jurquet calls for the French Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) to study and master Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought guides the peoples of all countries to victory. The actions of revisionists to attack and obstruct the spread of Mao Zedong Thought will not succeed.

New China News Agency, May 13th: The organ of the French Marxist-Leninist Communist Party, *Nouvelle Humanité*, published an article by Jacques Jurquet in its April 25th issue, enthusiastically praising *Quotations from Chairman Mao* and highly evaluating Mao Zedong Thought.

At the same time as publishing this article, *Nouvelle Humanité* also published in full the preface written by Comrade Lin Biao for the reprint of *Quotations from Chairman Mao*.

In his article, Jacques Jurquet said: Already, millions of French people know about *Quotations from Chairman Mao*, and among them, hundreds of thousands have this book. An increasing number of Marxist-Leninists are reading and studying this book, striving to understand its teachings.

The article said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the most reliable compass guiding all revolutionaries forward, guiding the Chinese people and the peoples of all countries in the world forward. It is our most effective weapon, the most effective weapon of the broad masses."

The article said: "Mao Zedong Thought was born out of the greatest revolutionary victory in human history. Mao Zedong Thought, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Mao Zedong, has enabled hundreds of millions of Chinese people to break free from the oppression and exploitation of imperialism and walk the brilliant path of socialism."

The article said: "Mao Zedong Thought embodies the essence of revolutionary experience in history. Mao Zedong Thought was forged in the crucible of nearly half a century of fierce class struggle by the Chinese people. Even the highest quality steel in the world cannot compare to the strength of Mao Zedong Thought, and even the brightest sun cannot compare to the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the science of proletarian revolution. Mao Zedong Thought can explain our entire past history and can also foresightfully see the future."

The article pointed out that the revisionists attack Mao Zedong Thought and attempt to obstruct its spread, but such actions by the revisionists are entirely in vain.

The article said: "We believe that Mao Zedong Thought is universally applicable. Mao Zedong Thought inspires the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries."

The article pointed out: "Chairman Mao has always emphasized that one must apply the universally applicable principles of Marxism-Leninism according to the specific national conditions and historical circumstances."

The final part of the article calls for the entire party to study and master Mao Zedong Thought. The article said: "Our French (Marxist-Leninist) Communist Party was born after a struggle lasting four years. As long as party members who are loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism are good at studying and mastering the teachings of Mao Zedong, our French (Marxist-Leninist) Communist Party will definitely grow and develop, be built up and consolidated. Only when it can effectively apply the thoughts of the greatest revolutionary theorist and practitioner of our time in its work, can it truly be worthy of the name of a party in the era of Mao Zedong."

The article said: "We must understand that the urgent historical necessity is to spread, organize the study of, and help master the contemporary revolutionary science of Mao Zedong Thought. We must spare no effort to master the thoughts of the greatest revolutionary leader in our daily actions and in every one of our struggles."

    雅克·儒尔盖号召法共（马列）全党努力学习和掌握毛泽东思想
    毛泽东思想指引各国人民胜利前进
    修正主义者攻击和阻挠毛泽东思想传播的行径决不能得逞
    新华社十三日讯　法国马克思列宁主义共产党机关报《新人道报》，四月二十五日一期刊登了雅克·儒尔盖写的一篇文章，热情赞扬《毛主席语录》，高度评价毛泽东思想。
    《新人道报》在刊登这篇文章的同时，全文刊载了林彪同志为《毛主席语录》撰写的《再版前言》。
    雅克·儒尔盖在文章中说：已经有数以百万计的法国人知道《毛主席语录》，而且他们当中，有几十万人已经有了这本书。越来越多的马克思列宁主义者正在阅读和学习这本书，努力领会书中的教导。
    文章说：“毛泽东思想是指引一切革命者前进、指引中国人民以及全世界各国人民前进的最可靠的指南针，是我们最有效的武器，是最广大群众的最有效的武器。”
    文章说：“毛泽东思想产生于人类历史上最伟大的革命的胜利实践，毛泽东思想使亿万中国人民在以毛泽东为首的中国共产党领导下，摆脱了帝国主义的压迫和剥削，走上了社会主义的光辉道路。”
    文章说：“毛泽东思想体现了历史上革命经验的精华。”“毛泽东思想是在中国人民进行近半个世纪的激烈阶级斗争的熔炉中锻炼出来的，世界上质量最高的钢也比不上毛泽东思想的坚强，光芒万丈的太阳也比不上毛泽东思想的光辉。”“毛泽东思想是无产阶级革命的科学。毛泽东思想既能说明我们过去的整个历史，又能英明地预见未来。”
    文章指出，修正主义者攻击毛泽东思想，妄图阻挠毛泽东思想的传播，但是，修正主义者的这种行径完全是徒劳的。
    文章说：“我们认为，毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的，毛泽东思想鼓舞着各国人民的革命斗争。”
    文章指出：“毛主席从来就强调，必须按照具体的国情和历史条件运用放之四海而皆准的马克思列宁主义的原则。”
    文章的最后部分号召全党努力学习和掌握毛泽东思想。文章说：“我们法国（马克思列宁主义）共产党是经历了四年之久的艰巨的斗争之后诞生的。只要忠于马克思列宁主义原则的党员善于很好地学习和掌握毛泽东的教导，我们法国（马克思列宁主义）共产党就一定能成长壮大，建设起来，巩固起来。只有当它能卓有成效地活学活用当代最伟大的革命思想家和实践家的思想，它才能真正无愧于毛泽东时代的党的称号。”
    文章说：“我们必须懂得，加紧传播，组织学习和帮助掌握当代的革命科学毛泽东思想，是不可缺少的历史必需。”“我们必须全力以赴，在日常行动中，在我们的每一个斗争中，来掌握最伟大的革命领袖的思想。”
