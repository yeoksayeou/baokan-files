The revolutionary cadres and workers of our factory have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," launching a mass movement to establish large-scale Mao Zedong Thought schools. While studying politics, military affairs, and criticizing the bourgeoisie, we have also established a farm. Through two years of effort, especially under the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have achieved fruitful results.

Fruitful Results

In the process of engaging in agricultural and sideline production while primarily focusing on industrial work, the revolutionary cadres and workers of our factory have significantly raised their class consciousness. They have developed an even deeper love for Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Simultaneously, they have acquired agricultural production knowledge. A team of revolutionaries with red hearts, skilled hands, capable of both industrial work and agriculture, and proficient in both pen and sword is growing.

Through participating in collective agricultural and sideline production labor, the family members of the workers have actively learned and applied Mao Zedong Thought, significantly raising their ideological awareness. Their concerns have shifted from individual families to the broader community, from personal matters to collective and national affairs, and even to global events. Under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, a new type of woman is striding forward on the path of revolutionization.

In 1967, our factory's industrial production fully exceeded the state plan, and agricultural production achieved a bumper harvest. The total grain output reached 1340,000 jin, a fivefold increase over 1966, realizing half self-sufficiency in grain for all factory workers. The vegetable output reached 770,000 jin, an 1.8-fold increase over 1966, achieving comprehensive victory in both industrial and agricultural production.

The basic construction of the worker-peasant new village has been laid. A preliminary integrated urban-rural, industrial-agricultural base with mechanization as the main focus has been established. It has become a battlefield for the broad masses of workers and their families to engage in agricultural and sideline production labor, practice the principle of being both workers and farmers, and promote ideological revolutionization. Workers deeply feel that "thousands of harvests, tens of thousands of harvests, the deepest harvest is Mao Zedong Thought taking root in our minds."

A Sharp Class Struggle

Regarding whether factories with conditions should primarily focus on industrial work while also engaging in agricultural and sideline production, our factory has faced a sharp and complex class struggle from the outset.

Following Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," the broad revolutionary cadres and workers, based on our factory's characteristic of having a large amount of idle land, advocated for the development of agriculture to accelerate the realization of ideological and enterprise revolutionization. They proposed a five-year plan to achieve basic grain self-sufficiency. At this critical moment, the capitalist roaders within the party eagerly jumped out, obstructing and suppressing in every possible way, mockingly saying, "The plan is grand, inspiring the people, suitable for propaganda, but for actual implementation, it needs to be 'practical,'" "Don't just think of good things, consider the unfavorable aspects," and so on. The capitalist roaders within the party repeatedly created difficulties, attempting to strangle this vital new thing in its cradle. The broad masses of workers, through actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, saw through the tricks of the capitalist roaders within the party. They firmly adhered to the bright path indicated by the "May 7th Directive," determined to become people who can wield a hammer for work, a hoe for farming, a pen for writing, and a gun for fighting the enemy, with high proletarian political awareness and comprehensive development. They broke through numerous difficulties and finally achieved a bumper harvest in agricultural and sideline production in 1966. However, the capitalist roaders within the party were not willing to admit defeat. In the spring of 1967, at the start of the farming season, they once again took to the field, riding the counter-revolutionary wind of economism, shouting, "The direction of the farm is wrong," "I can't manage agriculture, and I can't manage it either," and so on, openly resisting the implementation of Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive." The broad masses of workers, after studying the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, engaged in a head-on struggle with them, kicking away the stumbling block. With the strong support of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed in the factory, they organized a temporary agricultural production command department, bravely shouldering the heavy responsibility. They organized batch after batch of agricultural production labor armies, rapidly launching a wave of preparation for production. Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," our factory's agricultural production achieved unprecedented development last year. The sowing area increased from 3,000 mu in the previous year to 17,600 mu, with a significant increase in grain output, realizing half self-sufficiency in grain for all factory workers.

Should the factory engage in agriculture? Should it rely on hiring a batch of agricultural workers? Or should it rely on the masses of workers? The broad masses of workers seriously studied Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" and believed that engaging in agricultural and sideline production is not just about planting crops and producing grain; more importantly, it is about accelerating the ideological revolutionization of people, a major measure to prevent and combat revisionism. They said, Chairman Mao has shown us the bright path: self-reliance, everyone working, being both workers and farmers. Based on the spirit of being both workers and farmers, we organized workers to participate in agricultural production in the farm under the principle of ensuring the completion of the industrial production plan. In 1967 alone, more than 25,000 people participated, with an average of five days of labor per person.

Through participating in agricultural production labor, the broad masses of workers received profound class education. Many comrades overcame the tendency to belittle agriculture, deepened their class feelings with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and underwent profound changes in their thoughts and emotions. The family members of the workers, in the process of production, actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, creating a new trend of selflessness, hard work, fearlessness of hardship, and fearlessness of fatigue. In this great revolutionary furnace, their thoughts have turned red.

Self-Reliance, Overcoming Difficulties

The broad masses of workers and their families opened up wastelands and farmed on the vast grasslands. They lacked agricultural machinery, funds, and seeds, encountering numerous difficulties. Some people mocked, "Waiting for you to harvest grain, my teeth will have fallen out!" Some well-meaning comrades were also concerned that it wouldn't work out. What should we do? Should we rely on self-reliance and hard struggle, or should we ask the state for help and wait until we have the conditions to start?

"Among all things in the world, people are the most precious." People armed with Mao Zedong Thought can overcome all difficulties. We decided to take the path of self-reliance and hard struggle. The broad masses of workers, with the heroic spirit of "overcoming all enemies and never being subdued by the enemy," relied on their own strength to overcome one difficulty after another.

In the first year of farming, there were only a few horses, and it seemed that the farming season would be missed. The workers and their families organized themselves and insistently plowed the land with human labor. Some comrades' feet developed large blisters, and they were so tired that their waists and legs ached, but they did not complain. After sowing the seeds, they encountered a spring drought. The workers and their families, after studying Chairman Mao's teaching of "in times of difficulty, we should see achievements, see light, and raise our courage," rallied their revolutionary spirit and fought against nature. They personally dug over a thousand meters of irrigation ditches, drawing water from wells to irrigate the fields, finally overcoming the drought. Last year, the relevant departments allocated us three chassis from scrapped tractors. The workers personally worked day and night to assemble them, completing the task in 42 days, saving the state 30,000 yuan in assembly fees and ensuring timely sowing.

Based on the spirit of "integrating urban and rural areas, integrating industry and agriculture," we mobilized the family members of the workers to move to the sideline production base, establishing a worker-peasant new village there. Initially, five or six people lived in one room; there were no kangs, and the family members personally built platforms. The broad masses of workers and their families, using Mao Zedong Thought as their ideological weapon, overcame numerous difficulties, building two family dormitories. At the same time, they also built over 1,000 square meters of "rammed earth" houses as temporary dormitories for workers participating in agricultural production labor.

Mao Zedong Thought is the Foundation of Victory

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The correct ideology representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become a material force to transform society and the world." Our process of establishing farms and engaging in agricultural and sideline production is a process of continuously arming people's minds with Mao Zedong Thought and realizing the ideological revolutionization of people. We regard Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" as the overall guideline for enterprise construction, with the greatest enthusiasm, greatest determination, and greatest effort, treating the farm as a classroom for actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works and as a battlefield for eliminating private interests and establishing public interests. We regard the "Three Articles" as sharp weapons for soul transformation and the best treasures for conquering nature. The masses of workers enthusiastically said: "Chairman Mao's 'May 7th Directive' has pointed out the direction for the revolutionization of enterprises, added boundless strength to our agricultural work, and Mao Zedong Thought is the foundation of victory."

In the process of carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle, the broad masses of workers, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "our current important task on the ideological front is to carry out criticism of revisionism," used Mao Zedong Thought to criticize and expose the revisionist poison spread by Liu Shaoqi, enhancing their class struggle awareness and two-line struggle awareness, raising their class consciousness, and firming up the direction of engaging in agriculture. Many workers, using the "Three Articles" as their ideological weapon, consciously engaged in self-criticism and criticized revisionism, linking the revolution of nature with the revolution of the "self" in their minds. The workers said: "When we encounter difficulties, it is Chairman Mao who points out the direction for us, firms up our confidence, and gives us the courage to overcome difficulties."

　　亦工亦农加速思想革命化
　　黑龙江省齐齐哈尔建华机械厂革命委员会
    我厂广大革命职工坚决执行毛主席的“五·七”指示，开展了大办毛泽东思想大学校的群众运动。在学政治、学军事、批判资产阶级的同时，兴办了农场，经过两年努力，特别是在无产阶级文化大革命推动下，取得了丰硕成果。
    丰硕的成果
    我厂广大革命职工在以工为主参加农副业生产劳动中，大大提高了阶级觉悟，更加热爱毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想，热爱毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。同时，也学到了农业生产知识，一支心红手巧，能做工，会务农，能文能武的革命化队伍正在成长。
    职工家属通过参加农副业集体生产劳动，活学活用毛泽东思想，也大大地提高了思想觉悟，从关心一家一户到关心千家万户，从关心一人一事到关心集体、关心国家大事、关心世界大事；在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，一代新型妇女正在革命化的大道上阔步前进。
    一九六七年，我厂工业生产全面超额完成国家计划，农业生产获得丰收。粮食总产量达到一百三十四万斤，比一九六六年增长五倍，实现了全厂职工用粮半自给，蔬菜产量达到七十七万余斤，比一九六六年增长一点八倍，取得了工农业生产的全面胜利。
    工农新村的基本建设已经打下了初步基础。一个城乡结合、工农结合、以机械化为主的初具规模的农村副业生产基地基本建成。它已成为广大职工和家属参加农副业生产劳动，实行亦工亦农，促进思想革命化的战场。广大职工深有体会地说：“千丰收，万丰收，毛泽东思想在头脑里扎下了深根是最大的丰收。”
    一场尖锐的阶级斗争
    在有条件的工厂要不要以工为主兼办农副业生产？围绕着这个问题，我厂一开始就存在着一场尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争。
    广大革命职工遵照毛主席的“五·七”指示，根据我厂空闲土地较多的特点，主张大办农业，加速实现思想革命化和企业革命化，并提出一个五年实现粮食基本自给的规划。就在这个关键时刻，我厂党内走资派，迫不及待地跳了出来，百般阻挠，极力压制，冷嘲热讽地说：“规划宏伟，鼓舞人心，做宣传行，要干可得‘实点’”，“不要光想好事，要考虑不利方面”等等。党内走资派一再出难题，妄图把这个具有无限生命力的新生事物扼杀在摇篮里。广大职工活学活用毛泽东思想，识破了党内走资派的阴谋诡计，坚定不移地要走“五·七”指示的光辉道路，做一个拿起锤子能做工，拿起锄头能种田，拿起笔杆能写文章，拿起枪杆能打敌人，有高度无产阶级政治觉悟，全面发展的人。他们冲破重重困难，终于赢得了一九六六年农副业生产的丰收。可是，党内走资派并不甘心失败。一九六七年春耕开始的时候，他又赤膊上阵，乘反革命经济主义妖风，大喊大叫：“办农场方向不对头”，“我不能管农业，也管不了”等等，明目张胆地抵制毛主席“五·七”指示的贯彻执行。广大职工学习了伟大领袖毛主席有关阶级、阶级斗争的教导，同他进行了针锋相对的斗争，一脚踢开了绊脚石，在人民解放军驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队的大力支持下，组织了临时农业生产指挥部，勇敢地挑起了这副重担，组织了一批又一批的农业生产劳动大军，迅速地掀起了备耕生产高潮。在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的鼓舞下，去年我厂的农业生产有了空前的大发展，播种面积由前年的三千亩增加到一万七千六百亩，粮食产量大幅度增加，实现了全厂职工用粮半自给。
    工厂办农业，究竟走哪一条路？是靠招一批农工呢？还是靠职工群众？广大职工认真地学习了毛主席的“五·七”指示，绝大多数人认为：搞农副业生产，不光是为了种地打粮，更重要的是加速人的思想革命化，是防修反修的一个重大措施。他们说，毛主席给我们指出了光明大道：自己动手，人人劳动，既当工人，又当农民。根据亦工亦农的精神，我们在保证完成工业生产计划的原则下，组织职工到农场参加农业生产劳动，仅一九六七年就达二万五千余人次，平均每人劳动五天。
    广大职工通过参加农业生产劳动，受到了深刻的阶级教育，不少同志克服了轻农思想，密切了和广大贫下中农的阶级感情，思想感情起了深刻的变化。职工家属在生产中活学活用毛主席著作，出现了一心为公、艰苦朴素、不怕苦、不怕累的新风尚，在这座革命的大熔炉里思想变红了。
    自力更生，战胜困难
    我厂广大职工和家属在一望无际的草原上开荒种地，没有农机具，没有资金，没有种子，遇到不少的困难。有人讽刺说：“等着吃你们打下的粮食，我的牙都老掉了！”一些好心肠的同志也担心搞不起来。怎么办？是靠自力更生，艰苦奋斗；还是向国家伸手，等有了条件再干？
    “世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。”毛泽东思想武装起来的人，就能战胜一切困难。我们决心走自力更生、艰苦创业的道路。广大职工以“压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”的英雄气概，依靠自己的力量战胜了一个又一个的困难。
    头一年种地，只有几匹马，眼看就要贻误农时了。职工和家属组织起来，硬是用人拉犁种地。有的同志的脚磨起了大泡，累得腰酸腿疼，没有叫一声苦。种子播下以后，遇上了春旱。职工和家属学习了毛主席“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气”的教导，振奋起革命精神，同大自然作斗争，自己动手挖了一千多米长的水渠，从井里抽水浇地，终于战胜了干旱。去年，有关部门从报废的拖拉机零件中，拨给我们三台底盘，职工们自己动手昼夜突击，用四十二天的时间把它们装配好了，给国家节省了三万元的装配费，保证了适时播种。
    根据“城乡结合，工农结合”的精神，我们动员职工家属迁到副业生产基地，在那里建立了工农新村。开始，五、六十人住一间房子；没有炕，家属自己动手搭铺。广大职工和家属，用毛泽东思想为思想武器，战胜了重重困难，修起了两栋家属宿舍。同时，还盖起一千余平方米“干打垒”的房子，作为职工参加农业生产劳动的临时宿舍。
    毛泽东思想是胜利的根本
    毛主席教导我们：“代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”我们办农场，进行农副业生产的过程，是不断地用毛泽东思想武装人的头脑，实现人的思想革命化的过程。我们把毛主席的“五·七”指示作为企业建设的总纲领，以最大的热情、最大的决心、最大的干劲，把农场当作活学活用毛主席著作的课堂，作为破私立公的战场。把“老三篇”作为改造灵魂的锐利武器，征服大自然的最好法宝。职工群众热情洋溢地说：“毛主席的‘五·七’指示，给企业革命化建设指明了方向，给我们办农业增添了无穷的力量，毛泽东思想是胜利的根本。”
    在开展革命大批判过程中，广大职工遵照毛主席“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”的教导，用毛泽东思想对照批判中国赫鲁晓夫所散布的修正主义毒素，增强了阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争观念，提高了阶级觉悟，坚定了办农业的方向。许多职工以“老三篇”为思想武器，自觉地斗私批修，把革大自然的命同革自己头脑里“私”字的命联系起来。职工们说：“当我们遇到困难的时候，是毛主席给我们指出了方向，坚定了我们的信心，给了我们战胜困难的勇气。”
