The entire line of the Jinpu Railway is experiencing a great situation in revolution and production. Revolutionary committees combining the three elements have emerged one after another, and trains loaded with passengers and cargo are running smoothly.

According to Xinhua News Agency on May 6, under the brilliant guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolution and production situation on the entire line of the Jinpu Railway is excellent. Along this railway line, revolutionary committees combining the three elements have emerged one after another in the railway bureaus, sub-bureaus, and various stations and sections; trains loaded with cargo and passengers are running smoothly north and south. The broad revolutionary masses of workers on the entire line are full of confidence and are firmly advancing along the revolutionary track indicated by Chairman Mao.

The Jinpu line runs through Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, and is one of the major north-south transportation arteries of China, bearing extremely heavy transportation tasks. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and class enemies such as landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists have used every trick in the book to try to disrupt the transportation on this railway and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, the broad revolutionary masses of workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and with the support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army, have smashed the plots of the class enemies and taken control of the fate of railway transportation, ensuring smooth north-south transportation for the motherland.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the revolution and production situation on the entire line of the Jinpu Railway is excellent and getting better. Now, the Beijing, Jinan, and Shanghai Railway Bureaus and the Tianjin, Jinan, Xuzhou, and Nanjing Railway Sub-bureaus along this railway line have all established revolutionary committees combining the three elements. The revolutionary mass organizations of the Bengbu Railway Sub-bureau have achieved revolutionary great unity. In the main stations and sections on the entire line, 80 percent have established temporary power organs combining the three elements of the revolution. The broad revolutionary masses of workers are full of enthusiasm, the transportation order on the entire line is good, and the train passing capacity is continuously increasing.

After Chairman Mao's latest instructions were transmitted to the entire line of the Jinpu Railway, the broad revolutionary masses of workers received great education and inspiration. They follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, seriously study and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and promptly promote the realization and consolidation of revolutionary great unity and the three elements of the revolution. The broad revolutionary masses of workers are holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, criticizing and repudiating revisionism, and their spiritual outlook is completely changed, with many selfless and altruistic deeds emerging. Many drivers and firemen have criticized the "material incentives" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents, igniting revolutionary enthusiasm. They seriously implement Chairman Mao's instruction to "be thrifty and make revolution," using less coal than before. Many loading and unloading workers at stations have further enhanced their sense of responsibility as masters through studying the "Three Old Articles," and handle goods very carefully. The broad train crew members actively improve their service attitude and enthusiastically serve the passengers. On the northbound and southbound express trains between Beijing and Shanghai, such as the 13th and 14th special fast trains, one can often see crew members helping the elderly and children board and alight from the train. They also deliver hot water and hot meals to the passengers. Since the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Jinan Station has been selling long-distance bus tickets for 22 bus stations and handling integrated transportation business for railways, highways, and waterways, greatly facilitating the passengers. This station also actively delivers train tickets to passengers in the city and suburbs, books hotels for passengers, and arranges hospital care for sick passengers, which has been welcomed by the broad masses of passengers.

The broad train crew members are not only servants of the people but also glorious propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought. They organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes for passengers together with the People's Liberation Army on duty on the trains. Every morning, facing the sunrise, they pay respects to the great leader Chairman Mao together with the passengers, wishing Chairman Mao eternal life. Along the way, they study Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the passengers. Some trains also hold criticism meetings to severely criticize the counter-revolutionary crimes of China's Khrushchev.

In the battle to seize the revolution and promote production, revolutionary old workers have played a great role. Old workers of the railway with a glorious revolutionary tradition firmly implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," and have won the love of the broad revolutionary masses of workers. Many old workers have been elected to the revolutionary committees by the revolutionary masses.

The members of the revolutionary committees of the Tianjin, Jinan, and Xuzhou Railway Sub-bureaus and many stations and sections along the Jinpu Railway line remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "being both an 'official' and a common person." After being elected to leadership positions by the revolutionary masses, they have not forgotten to always be ordinary laborers and share the hardships with the workers. In early April, some trains were backed up on both sides of the Nanjing Yangtze River ferry. The members of the revolutionary committee of the ferry station took the initiative to go to the most difficult working conditions, the hot and tiring fireman's position, to take shifts and fight with the workers until the backed-up trains were cleared. Their actions were praised by the workers.

　　津浦铁路全线革命和生产出现一派大好形势
　　三结合的革命委员会联翩出现
　　满载旅客、物资的列车畅通无阻
    据新华社五日讯　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，津浦铁路全线革命和生产形势大好。在这条铁路沿线的铁路局、分局和各站、段，三结合的革命委员会联翩出现；满载物资和旅客的列车南来北往，畅通无阻。全线广大革命职工满怀信心，正在坚定不移地沿着毛主席指引的革命轨道胜利前进。
    津浦线贯穿河北、山东、安徽和江苏四省，是我国铁路南北运输大动脉之一，担负着极为繁重的运输任务。无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，党内一小撮走资派和地、富、反、坏、右等阶级敌人耍尽阴谋诡计，妄图中断这条铁路的运输，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。然而，用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命职工在人民解放军的支持协助下，粉碎了阶级敌人的阴谋，把铁路运输的命运牢牢地掌握在自己的手中，保证了祖国的南北运输畅通无阻。
    在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，津浦铁路全线的革命和生产形势一派大好，越来越好。现在，这条铁路沿线的北京、济南、上海铁路局和天津、济南、徐州、南京铁路分局都成立了三结合的革命委员会。蚌埠铁路分局革命群众组织已经实现了革命大联合。全线主要站、段，有百分之八十建立了革命三结合的临时权力机构。广大革命职工的干劲充沛，全线运输秩序良好，列车通过能力不断提高。
    毛主席的一系列最新指示传到津浦路全线以后，广大革命职工受到极大的教育和鼓舞。他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真学习和落实毛主席的最新指示，迅速促进了革命大联合和革命三结合的实现和巩固。广大革命职工大办毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛泽东思想，斗私批修，精神面貌焕然一新，出现了不少舍己为人，助人为乐的动人事迹。许多司机、司炉批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货，激发了革命干劲。他们认真执行毛主席“要节约闹革命”的指示，用煤比过去省了。许多车站的装卸工人通过学习“老三篇”，进一步提高了主人翁责任感，装卸货物十分仔细。广大列车员也积极改进服务态度，热忱对待旅客。在往返北京至上海的十三次、十四次特别快车上，经常可以看到列车员扶老携幼上车下车。他们还把一壶壶热水、一盒盒热饭送到旅客手中。济南车站从无产阶级文化大革命开始，就为二十二个汽车站代售长途汽车票，并办理铁路、公路和水运联运业务，大大方便了旅客。这个车站还主动为市区和郊区旅客送火车票，代旅客预订旅馆，为旅客中的病号联系医院等等，受到了广大旅客的欢迎。
    广大的列车员不仅是人民的勤务员，也是光荣的毛泽东思想宣传员。他们同在列车上值勤的人民解放军一起组织旅客开办毛泽东思想学习班。每天清晨，迎着朝阳，同旅客一起共同向伟大领袖毛主席致敬，敬祝毛主席万寿无疆。途中，他们同顾客一起学习毛主席的最新指示。有些列车还举行批判会，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命罪行。
    在抓革命、促生产的战斗中，革命的老工人发挥了巨大的作用。具有光荣革命传统的铁路老工人坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，得到了广大革命职工的爱戴，不少老工人被革命群众选进革命委员会。
    天津、济南、徐州等铁路分局及津浦铁路沿线许多站、段的革命委员会的委员们，牢记伟大领袖毛主席关于“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，被革命群众选到领导岗位之后，没有忘记要永远做一名普通劳动者，同工人共甘苦。南京长江轮渡两岸，今年四月初曾积压了一些列车，轮渡忙不过来。轮渡所革命委员会成员主动到工作条件最差，又热又累的司炉岗位上顶班，同工人一起战斗，直到把积压的列车疏通完。他们的这种行动，受到工人们的赞扬。
