The Congolese (Brazzaville) government spokesperson, Minister of Information André Onkabé, announced on the Congolese (Brazzaville) radio on May 14 that the Congolese (Brazzaville) government had recently foiled a plot by mercenaries hired by imperialists to incite rebellion in the country.

He said that on the night of May 13 to the early morning of May 14, a group of mercenaries, bought by foreigners and commanded by a European, broke into the Congolese (Brazzaville) capital, Brazzaville, attempting to incite rebellion. However, as in the past, their actions met with a shameful failure once again.

Onkabé, after describing the capture of these mercenaries, firmly stated that these mercenaries were bought by imperialists, and the nature of imperialism will never change.

Onkabé finally called on everyone to stay vigilant.

On May 15, the Congolese (Brazzaville) delegation led by President Massamba-Débat, who was in Tanzania, issued a statement pointing out: "The new provocations by imperialism do not surprise us at all." The statement accused the agents of big corporations, reactionaries, and those who still dream of exploiting the wealth of Congolese (Brazzaville), of trying to drag the Congolese (Brazzaville) people back into the political quagmire before the August 1963 revolution, making them live a life of humiliation and loss of dignity.

The Congolese (Brazzaville) News Agency issued a commentary on May 15 on this issue, stating that the imperialist plots will never succeed. In the past, every vile attack by imperialism on Congolese (Brazzaville) has not been able to shake the determination of the Congolese (Brazzaville) people to live as people with dignity, freedom, and pride.

The commentary exposed the establishment of bases in some neighboring countries of Congolese (Brazzaville) to train saboteurs aiming to overthrow the current government of Congolese (Brazzaville). The commentary further pointed out that mercenaries led by Robert Benard and Jean Schram (two mercenary leaders in the Congo (Kinshasa)) will not be able to easily commit crimes in our country as they have done in some parts of Africa.

    刚果（布）政府发言人宣布
    粉碎帝国主义企图策动叛乱的阴谋
    指出帝国主义本性永远不会改变，号召人民提高警惕
    新华社布拉柴维尔十五日电　刚果（布）政府发言人、新闻部长安德烈·翁贝萨十四日在刚果（布）电台宣布，刚果（布）最近粉碎了由帝国主义收买的雇佣军企图在这个国家策动叛乱的阴谋。
    他说，十三日晚上到十四日凌晨，由外国收买和由一名欧洲人指挥的一伙雇佣军闯进了刚果（布）首都布拉柴维尔，企图策动叛乱，但是，象过去一样，他们的行动再一次遭到可耻的失败。
    翁贝萨在叙述了这批雇佣军被捕的经过后肯定地说，这伙雇佣军是帝国主义收买的，帝国主义的本性是永远不会改变的。
    翁贝萨最后号召大家提高警惕。
    十五日，正在坦桑尼亚的、以总统马桑巴—代巴为首的刚果（布）代表团发表一项新闻公报指出：“帝国主义的新挑衅，我们丝毫也不感到意外。”公报指责那些大财团的掮客、反动派和那些仍然念念不忘剥削刚果（布）财富的人，梦想使刚果（布）人民回到一九六三年八月革命以前的政治泥潭里去，要刚果（布）人民重新过受欺凌的生活，丧失自己的尊严。
    刚果（布）新闻社十五日就这一问题发表社论说，帝国主义的阴谋是决然不会得逞的。过去，帝国主义每次对刚果（布）发动的卑鄙袭击，都没有能够动摇刚果（布）人民作为具有尊严、自由和自豪感的人而生活的决心。
    社论揭露在刚果（布）的某些邻国建立了企图搞垮刚果（布）现政权的别动队训练基地。社论接着指出，以罗伯特·贝纳尔和让·希拉姆（在刚果（金）的两个雇佣军头目）为首的雇佣军，在我们这个国家，是不可能象在非洲一些地区那样轻易地为非作恶的。
