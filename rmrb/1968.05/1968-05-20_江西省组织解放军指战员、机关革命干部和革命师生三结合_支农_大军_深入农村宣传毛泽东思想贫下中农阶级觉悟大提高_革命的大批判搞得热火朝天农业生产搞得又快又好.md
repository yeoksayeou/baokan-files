In the support of nearly 200,000 "support agriculture" troops, Jiangxi Province's vast rural areas have seen a vigorous revolution in criticism and a swift and successful spring plowing season. The entire province's rural areas are bustling with vitality and a great atmosphere.

Since the start of the spring plowing season this year, the revolutionary committees at the provincial, prefectural, county, and commune levels in Jiangxi have, according to the needs of class struggle and spring plowing in rural areas, promptly organized nearly 200,000 soldiers, revolutionary cadres from government agencies, and revolutionary teachers and students to form a "support agriculture" army. This army, consisting of soldiers, cadres, and students, has marched into rural areas across the province. Their mission is to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions among the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, to establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, to mobilize and rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants to wage a struggle against the two classes, two roads, and two lines in rural areas, to organize the masses to carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, to grasp revolution, to promote production, and to win the first battle of spring plowing. Over the past month, rural areas across the province have achieved continuous victories in revolution and production under the impetus of the "support agriculture" army. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the entire rural area has seen a vigorous revolution in criticism, severely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev, and severely striking down a handful of class enemies. Mao Zedong Thought study classes have blossomed everywhere. The class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have been continuously enhanced, the socialist front in rural areas has been further consolidated, and the collective economy of the people's communes has been increasingly strengthened. The revolutionary situation has powerfully promoted production. This year, the spring plowing preparations in various parts of the province have been solidly carried out. Plowing, sowing, and seedling raising have been done on time, and the progress of early rice transplanting and various spring sowing crops has been rapid, entering the final stage of comprehensive completion. Many production teams have already completed or exceeded the spring sowing plan on time, in quality, and in quantity.

The "support agriculture" troops in various places have gone to rural areas to help the poor and lower-middle peasants fan the flames of revolutionary criticism, powerfully promoting the vigorous development of the rural cultural revolution. The "support agriculture" troops that went to the rural areas of Zixi, Lichuan, and Linchuan counties organized the poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots revolutionary cadres to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's statements on class and class struggle, extensively carrying out activities of "recalling the bitterness of the old society, comparing the sweetness of the new society, and criticizing" China's Khrushchev's theory of "exploitation is beneficial" and "class struggle is extinguished"; recalling the bitterness of the capitalist road, comparing the sweetness of the collective economy, and severely criticizing the fallacies of "three independences and one contract" and "four freedoms"; recalling the bitterness brought by the bourgeois reactionary line, comparing the sweetness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and severely criticizing China's Khrushchev's promotion of the "Peach Garden Experience." This has greatly enhanced the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. The "support agriculture" troops that went deep into the rural and mountainous areas of De'an County, according to the needs of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, used drawings, lantern slides, cartoons, exhibitions, and performances to organize the masses to carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism. They drew a picture to propagate a quotation from Chairman Mao, combined with the actual class struggle in the locality, and severely criticized a fallacy of China's Khrushchev. The poor and lower-middle peasants reflected that this way of doing things was easy to understand, easy to remember, and easy to criticize thoroughly.

The "support agriculture" troops in various places, in accordance with the busy spring plowing season, adopted the methods of fieldside and workshop criticism in addition to fully utilizing night schools and other means to extensively mobilize and organize the members to participate in revolutionary criticism, making the revolutionary criticism in rural areas wave after wave, achieving both depth and sustainability.

The "support agriculture" troops in various places, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," mobilized and relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants to launch a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies. After the start of spring plowing in Shangrao, Yudian, and Duchang counties, a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements hid in dark corners, spreading rumors, stirring up trouble, advocating the dissolution of teams, advocating individual farming, inciting clan disputes, attempting to muddy the waters, shift the direction of struggle, sabotage the rural proletarian cultural revolution, and disrupt spring plowing production. After the "support agriculture" troops went to these areas, they immediately focused on class struggle, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the minds of the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, using living class struggle facts to open everyone's eyes, and then leading the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to launch uninterrupted fierce attacks on class enemies, greatly boosting the morale of the poor and lower-middle peasants and greatly suppressing the arrogance of class enemies, rapidly raising the tide of revolution and production.

The "support agriculture" troops in various places, with the greatest enthusiasm, propagated Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, helping the communes and production teams to establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes. More than 12,000 "support agriculture" personnel in Fuzhou Prefecture went deep into rural areas, and the first thing they did was to present Mao Zedong's revolutionary classics and Chairman Mao's portraits to the poor and lower-middle peasants, vigorously propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The entire prefecture, under the enthusiastic help of the "support agriculture" army, established Mao Zedong Thought study classes from the communes to the production teams, from the fields to the households, totaling more than 15,000 sessions. More than half of the members in the entire prefecture participated in the study classes. In the study classes, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they focused on class struggle, conducted extensive exposure, criticism, and detoxification of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents, turning the study classes into an important battlefield for promoting rural class struggle and revolutionary criticism.

    深入农村宣传毛泽东思想贫下中农阶级觉悟大提高
    革命的大批判搞得热火朝天农业生产搞得又快又好
    新华社南昌电　在近二十万人的“支农”大军的帮助和推动下，江西省广大农村革命大批判搞得热火朝天，春耕生产搞得又快又好，全省农村到处呈现一派生气蓬勃的大好形势。
    今年春耕生产开始后，江西省、专区、县和公社各级革命委员会，根据全省农村阶级斗争和春耕生产的需要，及时组织了有近二十万解放军指战员、机关革命干部和学校革命师生参加的三结合“支农”大军，浩浩荡荡下到全省各地农村。这支“支农”大军到农村肩负的任务，就是向广大贫下中农宣传毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席最新指示，大办毛泽东思想学习班，发动和依靠贫下中农大抓农村两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，组织群众深入持久地开展革命大批判，狠抓革命，猛促生产，打好春耕生产第一仗。一个多月来，全省农村在“支农”大军的推动下，革命生产连打胜仗。在毛主席一系列最新指示指引下，整个农村革命大批判搞得热火朝天，狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，狠狠打击了一小撮阶级敌人。毛泽东思想学习班已遍地开花。广大贫下中农和革命干部的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟日益提高，农村社会主义阵地更加巩固，人民公社集体经济越办越好。革命的大好形势，有力地推动了生产。全省各地今年春耕的准备工作做得扎扎实实，翻田、播种、育秧各种农活不误农时，早稻插秧和各项春播作物的播种进度迅速，已经进入全面扫尾阶段，许多社队已经按时、按质、按量地完成或超额完成了春播计划。
    各地“支农”大军下到农村，帮助贫下中农把革命大批判的烈火烧得更旺，有力地促进了农村文化大革命的蓬勃发展。下到资溪、黎川、临川等县农村的“支农”大军，进村后就组织贫下中农和基层革命干部，反复学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，广泛地开展“大忆、大比、大批”活动，忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“剥削有功”、“阶级斗争熄灭”论；忆资本主义道路的苦，比集体经济的甜，狠批“三自一包”、“四大自由”的谬论；忆资产阶级反动路线带来的苦，比毛主席无产阶级革命路线的甜，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“桃园经验”。这样，大大提高了广大贫下中农的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。深入德安县农村和山村的“支农”大军，根据广大贫下中农的需要，采用画片、幻灯、漫画、展览、演唱等形式，组织群众，深入开展革命大批判。他们画一幅画，宣传一条毛主席语录，结合当地阶级斗争的实际，痛批中国赫鲁晓夫一个谬论。贫下中农反映，这样看得懂、记得牢、批得透。
    各地“支农”大军根据春耕繁忙的特点，除充分采用了田头、工间开展大批判外，还采取了办夜校等方式，广泛动员和组织社员参加革命大批判，使农村革命大批判的热潮一浪接一浪，做到了既深入又持久。
    各地“支农”大军遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，发动和依靠贫下中农向一小撮阶级敌人发动了猛烈进攻。上饶、余干、都昌等县农村在春耕开始后，一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派，以及没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，躲在阴暗的角落里，煽阴风，点鬼火，闹拆队，闹单干，挑起宗族纠纷，妄图把水搅浑，转移斗争大方向，破坏农村的无产阶级文化大革命，破坏春耕生产。“支农”大军下到这些地区后，就狠抓阶级斗争，用毛泽东思想武装贫下中农和革命干部的头脑，用活生生的阶级斗争的事实擦亮大家的眼睛，然后带领广大贫下中农向阶级敌人发起不停顿的猛烈进攻，大长了贫下中农的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风，革命和生产迅速掀起高潮。
    各地“支农”战士以最大的热情，向广大贫下中农和革命干部宣传毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席最新指示，帮助公社、生产队大办毛泽东思想学习班。抚州专区一万二千多名“支农”人员深入农村后，第一件事就是向贫下中农赠送毛主席的革命宝书，送毛主席像，大力宣传毛主席最新指示。全区在“支农”大军热情帮助下，毛泽东思想学习班从公社到生产队，从田头到家庭，共开办了一万五千多期，全区半数以上的社员参加了学习班学习。在学习班里，他们在毛主席最新指示指引下，狠抓阶级斗争，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，进行大揭发、大批判、大消毒，把学习班办成了推动农村阶级斗争和革命大批判的重要战场。
