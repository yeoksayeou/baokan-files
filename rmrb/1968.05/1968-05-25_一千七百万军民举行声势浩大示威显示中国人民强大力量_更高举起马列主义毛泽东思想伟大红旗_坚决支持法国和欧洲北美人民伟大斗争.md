The revolutionary masses and PLA soldiers across the country, filled with proletarian internationalist revolutionary fervor, have resolutely supported the fiery revolutionary struggles of French workers and students, and the widespread people's movements in Europe and North America. Over the past four days, more than 17 million workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary students, cadres, and masses, along with PLA soldiers, have participated in demonstrations and parades across the country. The massive demonstration movement, which began in the capital, has now spread to many large, medium, and small cities and rural towns across the country. The mighty force demonstrated by the 700 million Chinese people resonates with the revolutionary struggles of the people in France, Europe, and North America, striking a heavy blow against U.S. imperialism and all its lackeys.

Over the past four days, from the heart of the motherland, Beijing, to the capital cities of many provinces and autonomous regions, and even to remote factories, mines, rural areas, forest regions, and pastoral areas, a surging tide of support for the just struggles of the people in France, Europe, and North America has swept across the country. The demonstrators carried giant portraits of Chairman Mao, held up red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," sang the stirring "Internationale," and repeatedly raised their fists, shouting slogans such as: "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Down with the reactionaries of all countries!" "Firmly support the just struggles of the workers and students in Europe, America, and Oceania!" "Firmly support the just war of the great Vietnamese people to resist U.S. aggression and save the nation!" "Workers of the world, unite!" "Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live, long live, and ten thousand years live to our great leader Chairman Mao!" The revolutionary masses in Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Guangzhou held rallies and demonstrations today, entering the third day. In cities such as Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Harbin, Changchun, Jinan, Hangzhou, Hefei, Nanchang, Zhengzhou, Nanning, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Xining, Yinchuan, Urumqi, Guiyang, and Chengdu, as well as many medium and small towns, large-scale rallies and demonstrations were held over the past two days. In many cities, the number of revolutionary masses and PLA soldiers participating in the rallies and parades reached hundreds of thousands.

The people of our country closely follow the struggles of the French people. From the foot of the Tian Mountains to the coast of the East China Sea, from the vast grasslands of Inner Mongolia to the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, in recent days, millions of people have been listening to the radio for news of the revolutionary struggles of the workers and students in Paris. The revolutionary masses of our country enthusiastically acclaim: The revolutionary people of France have done an excellent job! Several cities have held mass meetings or revolutionary mass organizations have issued statements or telegrams firmly supporting the just struggles of the workers and students in France, Europe, and North America, paying tribute to the heroic sons and daughters of France with a revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune and the revolutionary people of Europe and North America.

The revolutionary torrent of the struggles of French workers and students has shaken the entire country of France and the capitalist world. The news from Paris has greatly inspired the people of our country. They all expressed their determination to follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, to support the revolutionary struggles of the people in France, Europe, and North America with actual actions of seizing the revolution and promoting production, and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. On May 23, nearly 10,000 workers at the First Automobile Works in Changchun held a rally and demonstration, firmly supporting the revolutionary actions of more than 60,000 workers at the Renault Automobile Company, the largest automobile monopoly in France, occupying the factory, and firmly supporting the just struggles of French workers occupying railways, ports, and a large number of important factories, mines, and enterprises. The workers of the Kaiping Coal Mine, with a glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, have been holding demonstrations and parades in recent days. They expressed their determination to support the revolutionary struggles of the people in France, Europe, and North America with actual actions of seizing the revolution and promoting production, building the socialist motherland stronger.

The revolutionary masses in various places angrily denounce the French reactionaries' use of violence and political deception to suppress the French people. In recent days, the French reactionaries have deployed tens of thousands of police and military forces to suppress the rebellious students, which has aroused great indignation among the revolutionary masses in various places in our country. They said, as our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The reactionaries in all countries are a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the end, only promote broader and more intense revolutions among the people." The Paris students have changed their previous methods of sitting in and petitioning, adopting fierce revolutionary actions, and have been fighting bravely with the reactionary police in the streets. This is the new awakening of the French people. The revolutionary masses believe that the French students will gain experience in dealing with the reactionary two-line struggle and achieve greater victories in the struggle.

The revolutionary masses in various places also angrily denounce the collusion and collusion between the Soviet revisionists, French revisionists, and the French reactionaries, betraying the workers and student movements in France. They pointed out that the trade union leaders of the French revisionist group have been calling for workers to "restrain" themselves from going on strike, forbidding workers from supporting student demonstrations, and even preparing to "negotiate" with the reactionaries and capitalists. Their purpose is to betray the French working class; they are the lackeys of the French reactionaries. Many members of rural people's communes held small meetings in the fields, criticizing the fallacies of "parliamentary road" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, and denouncing the crimes of the Soviet and French revisionists in disrupting the people's movement. The poor and lower-middle peasants pointed out that under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have firmly followed the road of thorough proletarian revolution pointed out by Chairman Mao, achieved great victories, and established a new China with a proletarian dictatorship. The Chinese Khrushchev, the Soviet revisionists, and the French revisionists are of the same ilk. We believe that the French working class and laboring people with the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Paris Commune will also kick out the French revisionist group and advance bravely along the revolutionary road pointed out by the Paris Commune!

The demonstrators pointed out that the current era is one in which imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards worldwide victory. The people of France, Europe, and North America have risen up to struggle, further accelerating the process of the political and economic total crisis in the capitalist world. People have reviewed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao: "The proletariat and laboring people of Europe, North America, and Oceania are in a new awakening. The U.S. imperialists and all other harmful creatures have already prepared their own gravediggers, and their days of being buried will not be long." The revolutionary masses in various places said that the vigorous development of the revolutionary struggles of the people in France, Europe, and North America once again proves the scientific correctness of the great leader Chairman Mao's judgment. Today, the revolutionary situation in the world is unprecedentedly good. We must hold high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, unite with the proletariat of the whole world, and unite with all oppressed peoples and oppressed nations, brave the winds and waves, advance bravely, and fight heroically to thoroughly bury imperialism, colonialism, and all exploitative systems, and build a new world without imperialism, capitalism, and exploitative systems. The broad masses of the people in our country are full of confidence in sending warm support to the people of France and various countries in Europe and North America who are fighting: The 700 million Chinese people firmly support you! Persist in the struggle, and victory will surely belong to the proletariat and the revolutionary people!

    一千七百万军民举行声势浩大示威显示中国人民强大力量
    更高举起马列主义毛泽东思想伟大红旗  坚决支持法国和欧洲北美人民伟大斗争
    据新华社二十四日讯　我国广大革命群众和人民解放军指战员，满怀着无产阶级国际主义的革命激情，最坚决地支持法国工人、学生掀起的如火如荼的伟大革命斗争，支持欧洲、北美广泛展开的人民运动。四天以来，我国各地参加示威游行的工人、贫下中农、红卫兵、革命师生、革命干部、革命群众和人民解放军指战员，已经达到一千七百多万人。从首都开始的这一声势浩大的示威运动，现在已经扩展到了全国各地的许多大中小城市和农村市镇。七亿中国人民所显示的强大力量，同法国、欧洲、北美人民的革命斗争遥相呼应，沉重地打击了美帝国主义及其一切帮凶。
    四天来，从祖国心脏北京，到全国许多省、自治区的省会、首府，以至边远的工厂、矿山、农村、林区、牧区集镇，到处掀起了波澜壮阔的支持法国和欧洲、北美各国人民正义斗争的浪潮。示威游行的革命群众抬着毛主席的巨幅画像，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高唱雄壮的《国际歌》，一遍又一遍地振臂高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒苏修！”“打倒各国反动派！”“坚决支持欧洲、美洲、大洋洲的工人、学生的正义斗争！”“坚决支持伟大的越南人民抗美救国的正义战争！”“全世界无产者，联合起来！”“战无不胜的马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”上海、天津、沈阳、南京、武汉、广州六个城市革命群众的集会和示威游行，今天进入第三天。石家庄、太原、呼和浩特、哈尔滨、长春、济南、杭州、合肥、南昌、郑州、南宁、西安、兰州、西宁、银川、乌鲁木齐、贵阳、成都等城市，以及许多中小城镇，这两天相继举行了大规模的集会和示威游行。许多城市参加集会游行的革命群众和人民解放军指战员，多达几十万、上百万。
    我国人民密切地关注法国人民的斗争。从祖国的天山脚下到东海之滨，从内蒙古大草原到云贵高原，这几天来，千千万万的人在收音机旁收听来自巴黎工人、学生进行革命斗争的消息。我国广大革命群众热烈欢呼：法国革命人民干得好极了！有十几个城市的群众大会或革命群众组织，发出了坚决支持法国和欧洲、北美各国工人、学生正义斗争的声明或通电，向具有巴黎公社革命传统的法国英雄儿女们和欧洲、北美各国革命人民致敬。
    法国工人、学生的斗争汇成的革命洪流，冲击了整个法国，震撼了资本主义世界。巴黎传来的这些消息，使我国人民受到很大的鼓舞。他们纷纷表示，一定要遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，用狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的实际行动，来支持法国和欧洲、北美人民的革命斗争。二十三日，长春第一汽车制造厂有近万名工人举行集会和示威游行，坚决支持法国最大的汽车垄断企业雷诺汽车公司六万多工人占领工厂的革命行动，坚决支持法国工人占领铁路、海港以及大批重要工厂、矿山和企业的正义斗争。具有光荣的反帝革命斗争传统的开滦煤矿工人，连日来纷纷举行示威游行。他们表示：要以狠抓革命，猛促生产，把社会主义祖国建设得更加强大的实际行动，来支持法国和欧洲、北美人民的革命斗争。
    各地革命群众愤怒地谴责法国反动派交替使用暴力镇压和政治欺骗的反革命两手镇压法国人民的罪行。法国反动派连日来出动成千上万军警，镇压造反的学生，激起了我国各地革命群众极大的愤慨。他们说，正如伟大领袖毛主席所指出的：“各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”巴黎学生改变过去静坐、请愿等方式，采取剧烈的革命行动，连续在街头同反动军警进行英勇搏斗，这是法国人民的新觉醒。广大革命群众表示相信，法国的学生一定会在斗争中取得对付反革命两手的斗争经验，夺取更大的胜利。
    各地革命群众还愤怒地谴责苏修、法修和法国反动派互相勾结，狼狈为奸，出卖法国工人和学生运动的叛徒行径。他们指出，法国修正主义集团的工会头目，连日来叫喊要罢工的工人“克制”，禁止工人支持学生示威，甚至准备同反动派和资本家“谈判”，他们的目的就是要出卖法国的工人阶级，他们是法国反动派的帮凶。许多农村人民公社社员在田间举行的小型集会上，还结合批判中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“议会道路”等谬论，谴责苏修、法修破坏人民运动的罪行。贫下中农们指出，中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，坚定地走毛主席指出的无产阶级彻底革命的道路，取得了伟大的胜利，建立了无产阶级专政的新中国。中国赫鲁晓夫和苏修、法修是一路货。我们相信，具有巴黎公社光荣革命传统的法国工人阶级和劳动人民，一定也会踢开法国修正主义集团，沿着巴黎公社指出的革命道路奋勇前进！
    示威的革命群众指出，当今的时代是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代。法国和欧洲、北美人民起来斗争，更加速了资本主义世界政治、经济总危机发展的进程。人们重温了伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“欧洲、北美和大洋洲的无产阶级和劳动人民，正处在新的觉醒之中。美帝国主义和其他一切害人虫已经准备好了自己的掘墓人，他们被埋葬的日子不会太长了。”各地革命群众说，法国、欧洲、北美人民革命斗争的蓬勃发展，又一次证明了伟大领袖毛主席这一科学论断无比英明正确。今天，全世界的革命形势空前大好，我们要更高地举起马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗，和全世界无产阶级联合起来，和一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族联合起来，乘风破浪，奋勇前进，为彻底埋葬帝国主义、殖民主义和一切剥削制度，为建立一个没有帝国主义，没有资本主义，没有剥削制度的新世界而英勇战斗。我国广大人民满怀信心地向正在战斗的法国和欧洲、北美各国人民发出热情的声援：七亿中国人民坚决支持你们！坚持斗争下去，胜利一定属于无产阶级和革命的人民！
