The great proletarian cultural revolution is unprecedentedly good and getting better and better. Under the warm care of Chairman Mao, the Chengdu Municipal Revolutionary Committee was born.

On May 7, 300,000 military and civilian personnel held a grand meeting to celebrate. The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary people are determined to remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," to firmly grasp the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, and to further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination on the principle of Mao Zedong Thought.

New China News Agency, Chengdu, May 7: Under the warm care of the great leader Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Proletariat headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, on the day when the nation's hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel solemnly commemorate the second anniversary of the great leader Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," the Chengdu Municipal Revolutionary Committee was born in glory. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, is the political, economic, and cultural center of Sichuan Province and the southwest region. For a long time, the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in this region has been extremely sharp and complex. Khrushchev and his agents in the southwest and Sichuan have been frantically carrying out their evil activities to restore capitalism. In the unprecedented great proletarian cultural revolution, the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of revolutionary people in the Chengdu region have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continuously launching fierce attacks on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in the southwest, Sichuan, and Chengdu regions, achieving one great victory after another.

At present, the situation of the great proletarian cultural revolution in the Chengdu region is unprecedentedly good and getting better and better. The great Mao Zedong Thought is unprecedentedly popularized, and the proletarian consciousness and the consciousness of the struggle between the two lines of the revolutionary people have been unprecedentedly heightened. Mao Zedong Thought study classes are blooming everywhere and getting better and better. The revolutionary great criticism is becoming more and more profound. The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary people are using various forms to concentrate their firepower and targets, launching a powerful offensive against Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in the southwest, Sichuan, and Chengdu, making this handful of enemies of the proletariat like rats crossing the street, everyone shouting to beat them.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, more than 80% of the factories, enterprises, and rural people's communes in the city have achieved revolutionary great unity on the principle of Mao Zedong Thought. Many factories, offices, schools, shops, and rural people's communes have established revolutionary committees. The great proletarian cultural revolution has greatly promoted the thought revolutionization of people, promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production in Chengdu. The industrial front of the whole city is full of new vitality, the suburban agricultural production had a bumper harvest last year, and this year's winter crops are also growing well, with a bumper harvest in sight.

The broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Chengdu have firmly carried out the great battle command of the great helmsman Chairman Mao to "support the leftist broad masses," grasped class struggle, highlighted proletarian politics, and firmly united with the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses, fought together, smashed the various plots of the class enemies, and achieved great achievements in the "three supports and two militaries" work, establishing great merits.

On May 7, 300,000 military and civilian personnel in the Chengdu region held a grand meeting to warmly celebrate the glorious birth of the Chengdu Municipal Revolutionary Committee. The broad revolutionary masses and the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army shouted thousands of times and ten thousand times: "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

Comrade Sun Hongdao, the chairman of the Chengdu Municipal Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the celebration meeting. He said, sailing the vast ocean relies on the helmsman, doing revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Every victory achieved in the great proletarian cultural revolution in Chengdu is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought. After the establishment of the municipal revolutionary committee, we have thousands of things to do, but the most important thing is to better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. We should take Comrade Lin as a shining example, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Comrade Sun Hongdao emphasized that we must follow Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," with the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, firmly grasp the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. At present, we must resolutely oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism. The proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses of the whole city should further establish and run well the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination on the principle of Mao Zedong Thought. We must further deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary great criticism, thoroughly criticize and expose Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and combine the revolutionary great criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform of each unit. We must dig out all the hidden traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in the great waves of class struggle, and build the revolutionary committee into a revolutionary fighting command that is revolutionary and connected with the masses.

Comrade Sun Hongdao said, we must further implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," and seize a double harvest of revolution and production. We must further implement Chairman Mao's great call of "support the army and love the people," and greatly strengthen military-civilian unity. We must definitely further implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and seize the comprehensive victory of the great proletarian cultural revolution.

Comrade Hu Jicheng, a responsible comrade of the Chengdu Garrison of the People's Liberation Army, spoke at the meeting, warmly congratulating the victorious birth of the Chengdu Municipal Revolutionary Committee.

Responsible comrades of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group, other responsible comrades of the Chengdu Garrison of the People's Liberation Army, deputy chairmen and committee members of the Chengdu Municipal Revolutionary Committee attended the meeting.

The celebration meeting, amid thunderous applause and cheers, passed a telegram of respect to the great leader Chairman Mao.

After the meeting, a grand celebration parade was held.
