Running a factory depends on Mao Zedong Thought

The so-called "Chinese Khrushchev" said that running enterprises should "especially rely on factory directors, engineers, and technicians." This is sheer nonsense of revisionism!

The soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region of the People's Liberation Army have fiercely criticized the revisionist line of "military first," "technology first," and "business first" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing. They do not rely on technology or bourgeois "experts," but firmly implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." They have persistently and deeply carried out the revolutionary criticism, using revolution to drive production. After ten months of arduous struggle, they have finally built the People's Liberation Army's first paper mill—the "May 7" Military Paper Mill.

Xinhua News Agency, May 13th: The broad soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region of the People's Liberation Army have firmly implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," persistently carried out revolutionary criticism, used revolution to drive production, and after ten months of arduous struggle, built the People's Liberation Army's first paper mill—the "May 7" Military Paper Mill.

To better implement Chairman Mao's "May 7" directive, this unit decided to establish a paper mill to produce relief paper for printing Chairman Mao's works, contributing to the spread of Mao Zedong Thought. However, they had no experts, no technology, and no machinery and equipment, facing many difficulties. The unit's Party Committee first sat down to study Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and related discussions on the mass line, discussing the issue of what to rely on to run the factory and who to rely on to run the factory. They realized that relying on technology or Mao Zedong Thought, relying on bourgeois "experts" or revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is a major issue of the two-line struggle. The Party Committee decided: before drawing the blueprint, first clarify the direction, and organize the preparatory personnel to study for seven days. Everyone studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "the masses are the real heroes," "the wealth of society is created by workers, peasants, and laboring intellectuals. As long as these people grasp their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, they will not evade problems but will solve them actively. Any human difficulty can be overcome," and criticized the revisionist line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev. They said: The Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist line of "especially relying on factory directors, engineers, and technicians" to run enterprises is a line of individualism, a line that binds the hands and feet of the masses, a line of class capitulation. We must thoroughly smash this black line. In the war years, we relied on Mao Zedong Thought, using rifles and rice to defeat Japanese imperialism and annihilate the eight hundred thousand troops of the Kuomintang; on the Korean battlefield, we still relied on Mao Zedong Thought to defeat the nuclear-armed American imperialism. Today, we build factories and can only rely on Mao Zedong Thought, relying on soldiers and workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Through revolutionary criticism, comrades' awareness of the line struggle has greatly increased. They made a solemn vow: "No blueprint, we draw it ourselves; no factory building, we build it ourselves; no machinery, we make it ourselves; no technology, we learn it as we go." They are determined that no matter how great the difficulties, they must remain loyal to Chairman Mao, adhere to self-reliance, and achieve the goal of design and production in the same year. The soldiers and officers participating in the construction of the factory and the workers helping with the construction regarded the construction site as a battlefield for revolutionary criticism, seeing the drawing of a map, carrying a basket of soil, and laying a brick as a heavy blow to the Chinese Khrushchev.

The construction of the factory began. Was it to boldly innovate and take the road of building socialism quickly, efficiently, and economically, or to follow the rules and work within the foreign framework? This is a matter of whether Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" can be implemented. The Party Committee organized everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on self-reliance, hard work, breaking superstitions, liberating thoughts, and "overthrowing the slave mentality and burying dogmatism," and fiercely criticized the crawling revisionist line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev. Everyone realized that the crawling line advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev is a line of surrender and abolitionism. Everyone indignantly said: The Chinese Khrushchev wants to make us crawl within the foreign framework, we won't do it! We revolutionary soldiers must rebel against him and walk the path indicated by Chairman Mao. With boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, the soldiers and officers rushed against time, seized tasks, and fought continuously. After half a year, the soldiers and officers, together with revolutionary workers, overcame numerous difficulties and finally produced a complete set of papermaking machinery and equipment.

The paper mill was built, and relief paper was produced in batches. To prevent the tendency of focusing only on production and neglecting political and ideological work, the unit's Party Committee timely organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "politics is the commander, the soul," "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," and Lin Biao's instructions on highlighting proletarian politics, further criticizing the revisionist line of "military first," "technology first," and "business first" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing. Everyone deeply realized: Running a factory is not just about producing a few tons of paper, but more importantly, it is to cultivate cadres and soldiers into reliable successors who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and to turn the unit into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought. They regarded the factory as a living classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and a good battlefield for criticizing and repudiating revisionism. They studied politics every day, criticized bourgeois ideology every day, participated in production labor every day, smashed the "self," and established the "public," causing a revolution in their souls and promoting the revolutionization of their thoughts. The soldiers and officers, while in the machine room, had their eyes on the world, cared about national and world revolutionary affairs, and regarded the production of relief paper for printing Chairman Mao's works as a sublime duty to spread Mao Zedong Thought to the world.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," revolutionary criticism deepened step by step, and production increased step by step.

    办工厂靠的是毛泽东思想
    中国赫鲁晓夫说，办企业要“特别依靠厂长、工程师和技师”，这纯粹是修正主义的一派胡言乱语！
    人民解放军北京部队某部指战员，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫以及反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿所推行的“军事第一”、“技术第一”、“业务第一”的修正主义路线。他们一不靠技术，二不靠资产阶级“专家”，而是坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，持久地深入地开展革命大批判，用革命带动生产，经过十个月的艰苦奋战，终于建成了人民解放军第一座造纸厂——“五·七”军工造纸厂。
    新华社十三日讯　人民解放军北京部队某部广大指战员，坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，持久地开展革命大批判，以革命带动生产，经过十个月的艰苦奋战，建成了人民解放军的第一座造纸厂——
  “五·七”军工造纸厂。
    这个部队为了更好地落实毛主席的“五·七”指示，决定创办一座造纸厂，生产印刷毛主席著作的凸版纸，为传播毛泽东思想贡献一分力量。但是，他们一无专家，二无技术，三无机器设备，困难很多。部队党委首先坐下来学习毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针和有关群众路线的论述，讨论了究竟靠什么办厂，依靠谁来办厂的问题。他们认识到，靠技术，还是靠毛泽东思想，靠资产阶级“专家”，还是靠用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，这是两条路线斗争的大问题。党委决定：蓝图未绘，先整方向，集中七天时间，组织筹建人员进行学习。大家学习了毛主席关于“群众是真正的英雄”，“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的”等教导，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的修正主义路线。他们说：中国赫鲁晓夫的“特别依靠厂长、工程师和技师”办企业的修正主义路线，是孤家寡人的路线，束缚群众手脚的路线，阶级投降的路线。我们必须彻底砸烂这条黑线。在战争年代里，我们靠毛泽东思想，用小米加步枪打败了日本帝国主义，消灭了国民党八百万军队；在朝鲜战场上，我们还是靠毛泽东思想，打败了有核牙齿的美帝国主义。今天，我们建厂也只能靠毛泽东思想，靠用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士和工人。通过革命大批判，同志们路线斗争的觉悟大大提高了。他们发出了豪迈的誓言：“没有蓝图大家绘，没有厂房自己盖，没有机器自己造，没有技术干中学。”他们决心不管困难多么大，一定要做到无限忠于毛主席的红心不变，自力更生的方针不变，当年设计、当年投产的决心不变。参加建厂的指战员和帮助建厂的工人，把工地当作革命大批判的战场，把绘一张图、抬一筐土、砌一块砖，看成是对中国赫鲁晓夫的沉重打击。
    建厂开始了，是大胆创新，走多快好省地建设社会主义的道路，还是按部就班地按洋框框办事，这是关系到毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针能否落实的问题。党委组织大家反复学习毛主席有关自力更生、艰苦奋斗、破除迷信、解放思想和“打倒奴隶思想，埋葬教条主义”等教导，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的爬行主义的修正主义路线。大家认识到，中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的爬行主义就是投降主义、取消主义。大家义愤填膺地说：中国赫鲁晓夫妄图使我们按洋框框爬行，办不到！我们革命战士就是要造他的反，走毛主席指引的路。指战员们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚，对中国赫鲁晓夫无比仇恨的心情，争时间，抢任务，连续奋战。经过半年时间，指战员们和革命工人一起闯过了重重困难，终于制出了成套的造纸机器设备。
    造纸厂建成了，凸版纸成批地生产出来了。为了防止只抓生产、忽视思想政治工作的倾向发生，部队党委又及时组织大家学习毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导和林副主席关于突出无产阶级政治的指示，进一步批判了中国赫鲁晓夫以及反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿所推行的“军事第一”、“技术第一”、“业务第一”的修正主义路线。大家深刻认识到：办工厂不单是出几吨纸的问题，更重要的是要把干部、战士培养成为无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的可靠接班人，把部队办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。他们把工厂当作活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂、斗私批修的好战场。他们天天学政治，天天批判资产阶级，天天参加生产劳动，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，在灵魂深处爆发革命，促进了思想革命化。指战员们身在机房，放眼世界，关心国家大事，关心世界革命大事，把生产印制毛主席著作用的凸版纸，当作向世界传播毛泽东思想的崇高职责。
    他们在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针指引下，革命大批判步步深入，生产节节上升。
