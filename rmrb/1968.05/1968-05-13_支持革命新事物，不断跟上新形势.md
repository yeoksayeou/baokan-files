The editorial "The Red Earth of Northeast China" published in the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily conveys the voice of our great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. The editorial calls on us to act with a revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," to work hard and strive to be the best, to study new problems arising in the movement, to discover and support revolutionary new things, and to keep up with the developing new situation with vigor. We warmly endorse this and will resolutely carry it out.

In the course of our struggle, we have deeply realized that in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary new things keep emerging. These revolutionary new things often represent the general direction of the movement. Only by being good at discovering and supporting these revolutionary new things can we lead the movement to develop vigorously. Last March, Chairman Mao proposed that in places and units where power needs to be seized, the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy must be implemented to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat. However, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the original factory party actively promoted the reactionary bourgeois line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few," causing cadres to be sidelined and obstructing the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. At this time, the revolutionary masses proposed the method of holding cadre training classes to help them quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We believe that the opinions of the revolutionary masses are in line with Mao Zedong Thought, and immediately held cadre training classes to study Chairman Mao's theories on conducting revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and the "Three Old Articles," raising the proletarian consciousness of the cadres, correcting their attitudes towards the masses and mass movements. Many cadres examined their mistakes and quickly stood up, making Chairman Mao's latest instructions quickly implemented. Last year, under the influence of anarchist thinking, there was a period when labor discipline in the factory became lax. At this time, old workers in the repair workshop first initiated the drafting of the "Revolutionary and Production Agreement," striving to be models of adhering to proletarian revolutionary discipline and achieving new merits for the people in the revolution and production. We promptly grasped this new thing that emerged from the masses and promoted it throughout the factory, further implementing Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasping the revolution and promoting production." This year, the entire factory completed the national plan by 29% in the first quarter, and in April, the production task was completed ahead of schedule. After the publication of Chairman Mao's instructions on the basic experience of revolutionary committees, the broad revolutionary masses strongly demanded the reform of the cumbersome and overlapping administrative management system. Based on the masses' demands, we, on the basis of criticizing and eliminating the influence of the revisionist line, unified the ideological understanding of revolutionary workers, implemented streamlining and efficiency, and established a system of standing committee on-duty. Most members of the revolutionary committee went to the workshops to participate in labor and connect with the masses, greatly strengthening the thought revolutionization of the members of the revolutionary committee, making our factory's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution vigorously advance and achieve one victory after another.

We deeply feel that to timely discover new problems, support new things, and keep up with the new situation, we must follow the leadership and rely on the masses. To follow the leadership is to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and his latest instructions, be absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, and resolutely carry out his instructions without any deviation. We must constantly take the two-line struggle as the key, conduct self-criticism and criticize revisionism, overcome rightist conservatism and complacency, enhance political sensitivity, and timely pay attention to studying and discovering problems in the movement, and bravely support revolutionary new things. To rely on the masses is to go deep into the masses, conduct investigations, and be willing to be students of the masses, paying attention to the emotions, movements, creations, and experiences of the masses in a timely manner. The process of supporting revolutionary new things is also a process of fighting against class enemies and bourgeois ideology. Class enemies, in order to maintain their counter-revolutionary rule, will always try every means to interfere with and sabotage revolutionary new things; old habits will also hinder the growth of revolutionary new things. We must firmly stand on the proletarian standpoint, use Mao Zedong Thought to observe and identify things, and resolutely support anything that is in line with Mao Zedong Thought, allowing revolutionary new things to grow stronger and bigger in the storm of class struggle.

    支持革命新事物，不断跟上新形势

    《人民日报》、《解放军报》发表的《东北大地红烂熳》的社论传达了我们伟大领袖毛主席和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的声音。社论中号召我们：以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，鼓足干劲，力争上游，注意研究运动中出现的新问题，发现和支持革命的新事物，朝气蓬勃地跟上发展着的新形势。我们热烈拥护，坚决照办。
    在斗争的实践中，我们深刻地认识到，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，革命的新事物不断地涌现。而革命的新事物，又往往代表着运动的大方向。只有善于发现和支持这些革命的新事物，才能领导运动朝气蓬勃地向前发展。去年三月，毛主席提出，在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的“三结合”的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。但是，原厂的党内一小撮走资派在干部问题上，积极推行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，使干部靠边站，阻碍着毛主席最新指示的落实。这时，革命群众提出办干部集训班的办法，帮助他们迅速回到毛主席的革命路线上来。我们认为，革命群众的意见符合毛泽东思想，立即举办了干部集训班，学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的理论和“老三篇”，提高了干部的无产阶级觉悟，端正了他们对待群众和群众运动的态度，许多干部检查了自己的错误，很快地站了出来，使毛主席的最新指示迅速落实。去年，在无政府主义思潮的影响下，厂内曾一度出现劳动纪律松懈的情况。这时，修机车间的老工人，首先倡议制订“抓革命促生产公约”，争作遵守无产阶级革命纪律的模范，在抓革命、促生产中为人民立新功。我们及时抓住这个从群众中涌现出来的新事物，在全厂范围内加以推广，迸一步落实了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示。今年全厂第一季度超额百分之二十九完成了国家计划，四月份又提前完成生产任务。毛主席关于革命委员会基本经验的指示发表后，广大革命群众强烈要求改革庞大的、重叠的行政管理机构，我们根据群众的要求，在全厂批判和肃清修正主义路线流毒的基础上，统一了革命职工的思想认识，实行了精兵简政。革命委员会也建立了常委值班制度，大多数人到车间参加劳动，联系群众，大大加强了革命委员会成员的思想革命化，使我们厂的无产阶级文化大革命运动蓬勃地向前发展，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    我们深深体会到，要作到及时发现新问题，支持新事物，跟上新形势，就要跟上靠下。跟上，就是活学活用毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署和毛主席的最新指示，作到对毛主席无限忠诚，对毛主席的指示不折不扣地坚决照办，不断地以两条路线斗争为纲，进行斗私批修，克服右倾保守思想和骄傲自满情绪，提高政治嗅觉，及时注意研究、发现运动中的问题，勇敢地支持革命的新事物。靠下，就是要深入群众，调查研究，甘当群众的小学生，及时注意群众的情绪、群众的动向、群众的创造、群众的经验。支持革命新事物的过程，就是对阶级敌人和资产阶级思想作斗争的过程。阶级敌人要维护他们的反革命统治，总是要千方百计地干扰、破坏革命的新事物；旧的习惯势力也会阻碍革命的新事物的成长。我们必须坚定地站在无产阶级立场上，用毛泽东思想去观察、识别一叨，凡是符合毛泽东思想的，就毫不含糊地坚决支持，让革命的新事物在阶级斗争的暴风雨中，不断巩固、发展、成长、壮大。
