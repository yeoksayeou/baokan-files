The revolutionary struggle of French workers and students, which has shaken the world, has continued to develop with overwhelming momentum in recent days. The contemporary biggest group of labor traitors—the Soviet revisionist renegades—are trembling with fear and panic. The French ruling class, in order to extinguish the flames of this struggle, has adopted both violent suppression and political deception. The Soviet revisionist group has followed suit, actively cooperating, acting as the loyal henchmen of French monopoly capital, thereby further exposing their shameful traitorous faces.

In recent days, the Soviet revisionist leadership has blatantly played the role of cheerleaders for the French ruling class's violent suppression of workers and students. On the 25th, French Prime Minister Pompidou further openly ordered the national military and police to brutally suppress the gatherings and marches of the people. The Soviet revisionist group immediately applauded the French government's bloody suppression. The Soviet revisionist mouthpiece TASS eagerly reported on the same day Pompidou's announcement of this bloodthirsty order, saying with malicious glee that the French government had "instructed the police to quickly and effectively disperse every demonstration," and that there should be "no weakness or delay."

To support the French government's bloody suppression of the French people, Soviet revisionist publications have repeatedly viciously attacked the French people's just struggle, racking their brains to create excuses for the French ruling class's bloody suppression. *Pravda* on the day Pompidou announced the order, maliciously slandered the great revolutionary movement of the French people as "irresponsible actions by extreme leftist youth groups and provocations by troublemakers," claiming that "anarchists and provocateurs, with their irresponsible actions, have given the authorities an excuse to use violence against the strike." *Izvestia* slandered the revolutionary fighting spirit of the French people as a "hysterical atmosphere," and described the French ruling class's bloody suppression of students as "youths deliberately provoking conflicts with the police," as the result of "leftist groups' provocations."

The Soviet revisionist group's blatant defense of the French ruling class's atrocities is truly despicable.

The French ruling class, in order to soften the workers' struggle, colluded with the French revisionist renegade group and the yellow union leaders to concoct a "negotiation" scam. The Soviet revisionist group has extensively promoted this, actively serving the French ruling class's conspiracy. On the morning of the 27th, the French monopoly bourgeoisie, under the tremendous pressure of the heroic struggle of the French people, made some minor economic concessions to divide and weaken the workers' struggle. TASS immediately boasted, saying that an "initial agreement" had been reached to satisfy the basic demands of the working people, and hastily forwarded the French labor traitors' nauseating praise for the "agreement."

The growing unity of the student movement and the workers' movement in France has powerfully promoted the further escalation of the French people's revolutionary struggle. The Soviet revisionist renegades, who have always acted as the auxiliary forces to maintain the old capitalist order, are particularly afraid of this. They have used every means to sabotage the unity of workers and students, attempting to oppose and disintegrate their united struggle. On the 23rd, *Izvestia* in its report maliciously instigated, saying that students wanted to "discuss the tasks of the working class and their behavior in the struggle," and wanted to "teach the working class." Paris students called for a national demonstration on the afternoon of the 27th. TASS immediately shouted that this was a "violent demonstration." On that very day, it forwarded twice the French revisionist group's "order" to its members and French workers not to participate in the demonstration, and forwarded the French General Confederation of Labor and other yellow unions' so-called "condemnation" of this demonstration. Their intentions were truly malicious.

The Soviet revisionist renegades, in accordance with the needs of French monopoly capital, have betrayed the revolutionary cause of the French people, which has been praised by the French ruling class. Agence France-Presse on the 25th in a report gleefully praised the actions of the Soviet revisionist group, saying that it "hoped to see the situation in France return to normal." This statement revealed the traitorous nature of the Soviet revisionist group in maintaining the old capitalist order in France.

    维护资本主义旧秩序的吹鼓手  帮助反动派镇压人民的别动队
    苏修充当法国垄断资本无耻帮凶
    据新华社二十八日讯　莫斯科消息：震撼世界的法国工人和学生的革命斗争，近几天来，继续以排山倒海之势迅猛发展，使得当代最大的工贼集团——苏修叛徒们吓得胆战心惊，恐慌异常。法国统治集团为了扑灭这场斗争烈火，采取了暴力镇压和政治欺骗两手。苏修集团对此亦步亦趋，极力配合，充当法国垄断资本的忠实帮凶，从而使他们无耻的叛徒面目进一步暴露出来。
    最近几天，苏修领导集团露骨地扮演了法国统治集团对工人、学生暴力镇压行为的吹鼓手角色。二十五日，法国总理蓬皮杜又进一步公然下令全国军警残酷镇压人民群众的集会和游行。苏修集团立即为法国当局的血腥镇压拍手叫好，苏修喉舌塔斯社迫不及待地在当天就报道了蓬皮杜宣布的这项杀气腾腾的禁令，它幸灾乐祸地说，法国政府“已经指示警察要迅速地以最有效的方式驱散每一个示威行动”，而且“不得有任何软弱和迟延现象”。
    为了配合法国当局对法国人民的血腥镇压，苏修报刊还一再疯狂攻击法国人民的正义斗争，挖空心思地为法国统治集团血腥镇压制造借口。《真理报》在蓬皮杜宣布禁令的当天，恶毒地诬蔑法国人民伟大的革命运动为“极左青年小集团不负责任的行动和挑衅集团的胡作非为”，胡说什么“无政府主义分子和挑衅分子以自己不负责任的行动，为当局用暴力对付罢工制造了借口”。《消息报》把法国人民的革命战斗精神诬蔑为“歇斯底里的气氛”，把法国统治集团对学生的血腥镇压说成是“青年人故意挑起了同警察的冲突”，是“左倾集团”“挑衅”的结果。
    苏修集团这种公然为法国统治集团的暴行张目的卑鄙行径，真是令人发指。
    法国统治集团为了软化工人阶级的斗争，伙同法修叛徒集团和黄色工会头目炮制了“谈判”的骗局。苏修集团对此大肆宣扬，极力为法国统治集团的这一阴谋效劳。二十七日清晨，法国垄断资产阶级在法国人民的英勇斗争的强大压力下，为了分化瓦解工人斗争，作了一些微小的经济让步。塔斯社立即大加吹嘘，说什么“达成了关于满足劳动人民基本要求的初步协议”，并急急忙忙地转发法国工贼们对“协议”的令人作呕的吹捧。
    法国的学生运动和工人运动的日益结合，有力地促进了法国人民革命斗争的进一步高涨。一贯充当维护资本主义旧秩序别动队的苏修叛徒们，对此特别感到害怕。他们千方百计地破坏工人和学生的团结，妄图把工人斗争和学生斗争对立起来，分化和瓦解他们的联合斗争。二十三日《消息报》在报道中竟然别有用心地挑拨说，学生们想“讨论工人阶级的任务及其在斗争中的行为”，“想要教训工人阶级”。巴黎学生号召二十七日下午举行全国性示威。塔斯社马上叫嚷这是“暴力示威”。就在这一天里，它竟然两次转发了法修集团“命令”它的党员和法国工人不参加示威的声明，转发了法国总工会和其他黄色工会对这次示威的所谓“谴责”。其用心真是险恶已极。
    苏修叛徒们迎合法国垄断资本的需要，对法国人民革命事业的叛卖行径，得到了法国统治集团的夸奖。法新社二十五日在一篇报道中喜形于色地赞许苏修集团的行径说，它“渴望看到法国局势恢复平静”。这一语道破了苏修集团所扮演的维护法国资本主义旧秩序的叛徒本质。
