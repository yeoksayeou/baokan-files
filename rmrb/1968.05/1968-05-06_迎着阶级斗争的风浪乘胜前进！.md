Mao Zedong Thought is our most sharp weapon in fighting against all class enemies. The Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Motorcycle Factory, with the help of the PLA's leftist cadre, has led the broad revolutionary masses in closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, ceaselessly launching attacks on class enemies, and achieving one victory after another!

Born Amidst the Storms of Class Struggle

Our factory was established in 1958 by the merger of five cooperatives. Since its inception, the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads has been intense.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses of our factory, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, raised high the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries" and engaged in a tenacious struggle against class enemies. However, due to the collusion between a handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and due to the influence of bourgeois ideology on the masses, there was a period when two major revolutionary mass organizations were formed, busy with "internal strife," and relaxed their struggle against class enemies.

At a critical moment in the struggle, the PLA's leftist cadre entered the factory. They focused on the fundamentals amidst the chaos, held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, strengthened the broad revolutionary masses' deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and promoted and realized revolutionary great unity.

At this time, the broad revolutionary workers urgently demanded the establishment of a revolutionary committee. However, the process of establishing the revolutionary committee was full of class struggle. The proletarian revolutionary masses selected their representatives according to the five conditions proposed by Chairman Mao for proletarian revolutionary successors. A handful of capitalist-roaders and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists also used every means to engage in intrigue, attempting to sneak their favored people into the revolutionary committee. Under their incitement, some masses were also deceived, mistakenly believing that not electing someone meant "two years of rebellion in vain, not even half the sky." They also schemed to delay the birth of the revolutionary committee, attempting to exclude revolutionary cadres from being elected into the revolutionary committee.

The PLA's leftist cadre vigorously propagated Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, helping the masses further recognize that the red political power of the proletariat must be in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary masses. Thus, a leadership team that truly represented the interests of the broad revolutionary masses and was supported by them was finally elected. However, the class enemies did not give up. They spread rumors and set fires, attacking the new-born revolutionary power as "temporary and unsustainable!" Some masses influenced by them also thought that the newly elected comrades were "grasping at straws, seeking official positions."

Facing this situation, we considered that if we were busy holding celebration meetings and did not pay attention to educating the masses on class struggle, we would neglect the class struggle behind the drumbeats. At this time, we conducted education on consolidating proletarian dictatorship, recalling the bitterness of the working class not having the power in the old society, and emphasizing the hard-won socialist mountains and rivers, making everyone realize that our factory's revolutionary committee is a cell of the national revolutionary power and a component of proletarian dictatorship. We must support it, cherish it, and defend it.

Thus, after smashing the series of intrigues by class enemies, our factory's revolutionary committee was born amidst the storms of class struggle.

A Battle Command Center for Class Struggle

The revolutionary committee should be a battle command center for class struggle. Through several months of practice, we have come to realize that for the revolutionary committee to become a strong battle command center, it must first have a strong sense of class struggle. Initially, some comrades only saw "all red" and heard only praise, as if they could relax. Some members of the revolutionary committee also thought they should set up stalls, establish frameworks, and proceed with work in an orderly manner. The PLA's leftist cadre pointed out sharply in response to this active thinking: Is it to live a stable life or to revolutionize vigorously? Is it to stagnate or to advance victoriously and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end? This is a serious test. The proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses must not become complacent and slack off in their struggle against the enemy just because of victory. At this moment, a reactionary jumped out, privately making daggers and threatening to expose revolutionary workers, and writing reactionary slogans to fiercely oppose the revolutionary committee and the new-born revolutionary power. The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle is an objective existence that does not change with one's will." The intrigues of class enemies have deeply educated us. The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to overall victory, the more complex and profound the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads becomes. The wind will not stop just because the tree wants to be still; the enemy will not resign themselves to defeat and will make their final struggles. We timely grasped this new trend in class struggle, gave a resolute counterattack to class enemies, and pushed the movement forward.

Chairman Mao recently taught us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the revolutionary masses led by it and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie."

We follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, always directing the spearhead of struggle at the unrepentant capitalist-roaders within the party, as well as hidden traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Combining the specific facts of class struggle in our factory and various tasks, we carry on the great criticism persistently and deeply. Recently, our factory's third workshop further exposed the cover of class struggle, revealing the reactionary faces and intrigues of a handful of counter-revolutionaries and fugitive landlords. Through this living fact, we further criticized the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" by China's Khrushchev, raising the awareness of class struggle and line struggle among the broad revolutionary masses.

For the revolutionary committee to become a strong command center for class struggle, it must also achieve ideological revolutionization within the revolutionary committee. The members of the revolutionary committee must study and apply Chairman Mao's works and his latest series of instructions well, go deep into the masses, and together with the masses, firmly grasp class struggle. At the same time, within the revolutionary committee, through criticizing and reforming oneself, carry out active ideological struggle, do not cover up contradictions, and do not avoid contradictions. For those who made mistakes in class struggle, we criticize and help them within the revolutionary committee and also let them go to the masses to accept education. This approach is not weakening the revolutionary committee but strengthening it under the supervision of the masses.

Loyalty to Chairman Mao is the Key to Grasping Class Struggle

Reviewing the practice of class struggle in our factory's revolutionary committee over the past few months, we deeply feel that to firmly grasp class struggle, we must raise it to the height of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, so that we can grasp it firmly and tightly.

We guided everyone to study Chairman Mao's works and his latest series of instructions, with deep proletarian feelings, carrying out "bitter memories and sweet thoughts" activities. Through recalling bitterness and digging up roots, the broad revolutionary masses further strengthened their limitless love for Chairman Mao and further hated the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party who dreamt of restoring capitalism, and hated the traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries who infiltrated the party.

Through the education of recalling bitterness and sweet thoughts, the spiritual face of the broad revolutionary workers in our factory has undergone a tremendous change, presenting a scene of vigorous and energetic atmosphere. The broad revolutionary masses, with their loyal hearts to Chairman Mao, engaged in tenacious struggles against class enemies, demonstrating the mighty power of mass dictatorship. Once class enemies act, once reactionary thoughts surface, revolutionary masses use the magic mirror of Mao Zedong Thought to expose them, making class enemies fall into the vast sea of people's war. The black hands of capitalist-roaders extending into mass organizations were exposed, the ugly faces and evil activities of hidden fugitive landlords were exposed, the reactionary words and deeds of unrepentant rightists were exposed, and those who engaged in speculation were exposed. Everyone deeply realized: as long as we never forget to be loyal to Chairman Mao in our minds and always remember Chairman Mao's great teachings of "never forgetting class struggle," we will have the strength and wisdom to defeat all class enemies.

Only by being forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line can we consolidate proletarian dictatorship. We must, with the greatest determination, the strongest will, and the fastest speed, implement Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, and vow to build our factory's revolutionary committee into a revolutionary, authoritative, and vigorous battle command center of the proletariat. We will definitely, together with the broad revolutionary masses of the entire factory, advance amidst the storms of class struggle!

　　迎着阶级斗争的风浪乘胜前进！
　　北京摩托车制造厂革命委员会
    毛泽东思想是我们向一切阶级敌人进行战斗的最锐利的武器。我们北京摩托车制造厂革命委员会，在解放军支左人员的帮助下，怀着无限忠于毛主席的红心，率领广大革命职工，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不停顿地向阶级敌人展开进攻，取得了一个又一个的胜利！
    在阶级斗争的大风大浪中诞生
    我厂是一九五八年由五个合作社合并而成的。建厂以来，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争一直非常激烈。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我厂无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，同阶级敌人展开了顽强的斗争。但是，由于厂内一小撮走资派勾结地、富、反、坏、右分子进行破坏和挑动，由于群众受到资产阶级思想的影响，曾经一度形成两大派革命群众组织，忙于“内战”，放松了对阶级敌人的斗争。
    在斗争的关键时刻，人民解放军支左人员进厂了。他们从千头万绪中抓根本，通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，增强了广大革命群众对伟大领袖毛主席深厚的无产阶级感情，提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，推动和实现了革命的大联合。
    这时，广大革命职工迫切要求建立革命委员会。但是，建立革命委员会的过程，是充满了阶级斗争的过程。无产阶级革命派在按照毛主席提出的无产阶级革命接班人的五项条件挑选自己的代表。而一小撮走资派、没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，也千方百计地进行阴谋活动，妄图使他们中意的人钻进革命委员会。在他们的煽动下，某些群众也受了蒙蔽，错误地认为不把某人选上，就是“白造了二年反，连半边天也没了”。他们还处心积虑地妄图拖延革命委员会的诞生，排挤革命领导干部选进革命委员会。
    解放军支左人员大力宣传了毛主席的有关指示，使广大群众进一步认清，无产阶级的红色政权必须掌握在无产阶级革命派手里。这样，终于选出了能代表广大革命群众利益并为广大群众所拥护的领导班子。但是，阶级敌人并不罢休，他们煽阴风，点邪火，攻击新生的革命政权“不过是临时的，长不了！”个别受他们影响的群众，也认为新当选的同志是“捞稻草，想当官”。
    面对这一情况，我们考虑到如果忙于开庆祝会，不注意对群众进行阶级斗争的教育，就会忽视在锣鼓声后面的阶级斗争。在这个时候，我们进行了巩固无产阶级专政的教育，通过忆旧社会工人阶级没有掌握印把子的苦，大讲社会主义江山来之不易，使大家认识到我厂的革命委员会是全国革命政权的一个细胞，是无产阶级专政的一个组成部分，我们必须支持它，爱护它，保卫它。
    这样，在粉碎了阶级敌人的一系列阴谋活动后，我厂的革命委员会就在阶级斗争的风浪中胜利地诞生了。
    做阶级斗争的战斗指挥部
    革命委员会应当是阶级斗争的战斗指挥部。经过几个月的实践，我们体会到，革命委员会要成为坚强的战斗指挥部，首先必须有强烈的阶级斗争观念。开始，有些同志只看到“一片红”，只听到一片赞扬声，好象可以松一口气了。革命委员会的一些成员也认为应该摆开摊子，订个框框，按部就班地开展工作。解放军支左人员针对这种活思想，尖锐地指出：是安安稳稳过日子，还是轰轰烈烈干革命？是停滞下来，还是乘胜前进，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底？这是严重的考验。无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，决不能因为胜利，就骄傲和麻痹，懈怠起来，放松对敌人的斗争。就在这时，一个反动家伙跳了出来，私制匕首尖刀，威胁揭发他的革命工人，并写反动标语，猖狂地反对革命委员会，反对新生的革命政权。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“阶级斗争是客观存在，不依人的意志为转移的”。阶级敌人的阴谋活动，深刻地教育了我们。无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，越是复杂，越是深刻。树欲静而风不止，敌人不会甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。我们及时抓住这个阶级斗争的新动向，给阶级敌人以坚决的反击，把运动推向前进。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”
    我们遵循毛主席的伟大教导，把斗争的矛头始终指向党内死不悔改的走资派，以及隐藏的叛徒、特务、反革命分子，没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右。结合本厂阶级斗争的具体事实，结合各项任务，把革命的大批判持久地、深入地开展下去。最近，我厂三车间进一步揭开了阶级斗争盖子，揭露了一小撮反革命分子、逃亡地主等的反动面目和阴谋活动。通过这个活生生的事实，我们进一步批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争、路线斗争的觉悟。
    革命委员会要成为一个坚强的进行阶级斗争的指挥部，还必须在革命委员会内部实现思想革命化。革命委员会的成员，要很好地活学活用毛主席著作和一系列最新指示，深入到群众中去，同群众一道狠抓阶级斗争。同时，在革命委员会内部，通过斗私批修，开展积极的思想斗争，不掩盖矛盾，不回避矛盾。我们对于在阶级斗争中犯有错误的个别成员，就是既在革命委员会内部进行批评和帮助，也让他到群众中去接受教育。这种做法不是削弱了革命委员会，而是在群众的监督之下加强了革命委员会。
　　忠于毛主席才能狠抓阶级斗争
    回顾我厂革命委员会成立前后几个月来阶级斗争的实践，我们深深体会到，狠抓阶级斗争，一定要提到忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的高度，才能抓得狠，抓得紧。
    我们引导大家学习毛主席著作和毛主席的一系列最新指示，带着深厚的无产阶级感情，开展忆苦思甜活动。通过忆苦、挖根，广大革命群众更加增强了对毛主席的无限热爱，更加仇恨妄想复辟资本主义的党内最大的一小撮走资派，仇恨混进党内的叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子。
    通过忆苦思甜的教育，我厂广大革命职工精神面貌焕然一新，出现了一片热气腾腾、朝气蓬勃的景象。广大革命群众以对毛主席的赤胆忠心，向阶级敌人进行顽强的斗争，发挥出了群众专政的强大威力。阶级敌人一活动，反动思想一露头，革命群众就用毛泽东思想的照妖镜把它照出来，使阶级敌人陷于人民战争的汪洋大海之中。走资派的黑手伸进群众组织的阴谋活动被揭露出来了，暗藏的逃亡地主等的丑恶面目和罪恶活动被揭露出来了，没有改造好的右派分子的反动言行被揭露出来了，大搞投机倒把的坏分子被揪出来了。大家深刻地认识到：只要我们的头脑里时刻不忘忠于毛主席，时刻牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，我们就会有力量，有智慧，就能够战胜一切阶级敌人。
    永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能巩固无产阶级专政。我们要以最大的决心，最坚强的意志，最快的速度，落实毛主席一系列最新指示，誓把我厂的革命委员会建设成为一个革命的、有无产阶级权威的、朝气勃勃的战斗指挥部。我们一定要和全厂广大革命群众一起，迎着阶级斗争的风浪乘胜前进！
