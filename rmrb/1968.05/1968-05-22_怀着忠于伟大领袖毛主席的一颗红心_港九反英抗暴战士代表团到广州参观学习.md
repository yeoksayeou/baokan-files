New China News Agency, Guangzhou, May 21 - The delegation of Hong Kong and Kowloon anti-British resistance fighters, who have been honorably released from prison, recently returned to Guangzhou with a red heart loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao for inspection and study. They reported to their compatriots in the motherland about the experiences and great victories of the anti-British resistance struggle by Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots over the past year; they angrily denounced the heinous crimes of the British authorities in Hong Kong in brutally persecuting Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots. The heroic and unyielding fighting spirit of the Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots has received great praise from the revolutionary masses of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City. They expressed their firm support for the Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots to carry on their just struggle against British oppression to the end.

Since last May, the British authorities in Hong Kong have repeatedly sent large numbers of troops and police to suppress the patriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon with armed force, illegally ransacking patriotic trade unions, schools, and social organizations. Batch after batch of patriots have been brutally beaten and illegally arrested. However, the Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots, armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, firmly declared: "Our heads can be cut off, our blood can be shed, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned! Our heads can be cut off, our blood can be shed, but national dignity cannot be humiliated!" To defend the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, to uphold the sacred right to study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought, to uphold the dignity of the great socialist motherland, and to uphold their right to work and reside freely in Hong Kong, the patriotic workers of Hong Kong and Kowloon took the lead, holding high the revolutionary banner of "anti-imperialism is justified, resisting violence is not a crime," forming a vast and mighty force, and launching a magnificent struggle against British oppression.

The great teacher Chairman Mao's teaching of "resolving to struggle, daring to sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory" has inspired tens of thousands of patriotic workers, students, and patriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon to bravely join the ranks of the anti-British resistance struggle, powerfully counterattacking the bloody suppression of the British fascists, and making the enemy suffer a shameful defeat. A large number of patriots who were illegally arrested, including teenagers, stood tall and proud before the enemy, turning the enemy's "court" into a platform for propagating Mao Zedong Thought and exposing the enemy's atrocities. The illegally arrested patriots also, despite the inhuman torture of not being fed enough, not being given winter clothes, and being forced to do labor by the British authorities in Hong Kong, firmly refused to "confess." The relatives of the arrested patriots, including those over seventy years old, also firmly refused to handle the so-called "bail release" procedures for their relatives, showing an unyielding and heroic spirit.

"Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." The delegation deeply felt that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful and sharpest weapon in the anti-British resistance struggle over the past year. In prison, despite the enemy's various obstacles and threats, they persevered in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Without Chairman Mao's revolutionary books, they memorized Mao's quotations and the "Three Articles" word for word. They also wrote down Mao's quotations from memory and passed them on to their fellow prisoners to study. The great Mao Zedong Thought made them full of fighting spirit and courage, and their confidence in the defeat of the British and our victory became even firmer. They said that every victory they achieved in prison was the result of the shining of Mao Zedong Thought.

During their stay in Guangzhou, the delegation visited the former site of the Peasant Movement Training Institute, which Chairman Mao once directed in Guangzhou, and went to factories, rural people's communes, hero companies, and schools. They held report meetings and sharing sessions with workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, PLA soldiers, and Red Guards, exchanging experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works. The revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, PLA soldiers, and Red Guards, full of hatred for British imperialism and deep affection for the patriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon, warmly welcomed and comforted their comrades from the front line of the anti-British resistance struggle, and expressed their high respect to the patriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon through them. They strongly protested against the recent unreasonable obstruction by the British authorities in Hong Kong of our consolation rice being sent to Hong Kong and the kidnapping and persecution of our patriots. They warned the British authorities in Hong Kong that they must immediately stop the unreasonable persecution of the patriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon and must fully accept all the serious demands put forward by the government of our country and the patriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon on various occasions. If they persist in their mistakes and continue to act recklessly, they will only end up hurting themselves. They once again reiterated: They will, together with the people of the whole country, fully support the just struggle of the patriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon and will be their strong backing.

The responsible comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City and the Guangdong Province Committee for Supporting the Anti-British Resistance Struggle of Hong Kong and Kowloon Patriots, including Kong Shiquan, Chen Yu, and Yan Zhongchuan, received the entire delegation.

    怀着忠于伟大领袖毛主席的一颗红心
    港九反英抗暴战士代表团到广州参观学习
    这些光荣出狱的战士深深感到，伟大的毛泽东思想是反英抗暴斗争最强大最锐利的武器。他们向祖国亲人愤怒控诉了港英当局的滔天罪行。广东省广州市革命群众热烈赞扬港九爱国同胞的英勇斗争精神，誓作他们反英抗暴的坚强后盾
    新华社广州二十一日电　由光荣出狱的港九反英抗暴战士组成的代表团，怀着忠于伟大领袖毛主席的一颗红心，最近回到广州参观、学习。他们向祖国亲人报告了一年来港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争的经历和所取得的巨大胜利；愤怒控诉港英当局残酷迫害港九爱国同胞的滔天罪行。港九爱国同胞英勇不屈的斗争精神，受到广东省、广州市革命群众的极大赞扬。他们表示坚决支持港九爱国同胞把反英抗暴正义斗争进行到底。
    去年五月以来，港英当局连续出动大批军警，对港九爱国同胞实行武装镇压，对爱国工会、学校和社会团体进行非法搜劫，一批批爱国同胞惨遭毒打和非法逮捕。但是，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的港九爱国同胞坚决表示：“头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢！头可断，血可流，民族尊严不可辱！”为了捍卫战无不胜的毛泽东思想，维护学习和宣传毛泽东思想的神圣权利，维护伟大社会主义祖国的尊严，维护他们在香港自由地工作和居住的权利，港九爱国工人一马当先，高举反帝有理、抗暴无罪的革命大旗，组成浩浩荡荡的队伍，展开了一场气壮山河的反英抗暴斗争。
    伟大导师毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，鼓舞着成千上万的港九爱国工人、学生以及各行各业的爱国同胞，勇敢地参加反英抗暴的斗争行列，有力地反击港英法西斯的血腥镇压，使敌人遭到了可耻的失败。大批被无理逮捕的爱国同胞，其中包括十几岁的青年学生，在敌人面前昂首挺胸，把敌人的“法庭”变成了宣传毛泽东思想和揭露敌人暴行的讲坛。被无理逮捕的爱国同胞还不顾港英当局不给吃饱饭、不给冬衣穿、强迫服劳役等非人折磨，坚决拒绝所谓“认罪”，被捕同胞的家属，其中包括七十多岁的老人，也坚决拒绝为自己的亲人办理所谓“签保释放”手续，表现了坚贞不屈的英勇气概。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”代表团深深感到：战无不胜的毛泽东思想是一年来反英抗暴斗争最强大最锐利的武器。在监狱中，他们不顾敌人的百般阻挠和恐吓，坚持不懈地活学活用毛主席著作。没有毛主席的革命宝书，他们就凭着记忆一字一句地背诵毛主席语录和“老三篇”，他们还把毛主席的语录默写下来，传给狱中的战友学习。伟大的毛泽东思想使他们斗志昂扬，勇气倍增，港英必败，我们必胜的信心更加坚定。他们说，他们在狱中取得的每一个胜利，都是毛泽东思想光辉照耀的结果。
    代表团在广州期间，参观了毛主席当年在广州主办的农民运动讲习所的旧址，并到工厂、农村人民公社、英雄连队以及学校，同工人、贫下中农、解放军战士和红卫兵小将们一起举行报告会、讲用会，交谈学习毛主席著作的心得。广大革命工人、贫下中农、解放军战士和红卫兵小将，满怀对港英帝国主义的仇恨和对港九爱国同胞的深厚感情，热烈欢迎和慰问来自反英抗暴前线的战友，并通过他们向港九爱国同胞致以崇高的敬意。他们对港英当局最近无理阻挠我慰问大米运往香港、绑架和迫害我爱国同胞，表示强烈抗议。他们警告港英当局，必须立即停止对港九爱国同胞的无理迫害，必须全部接受我国政府和我港九爱国同胞历次提出的各项严正要求。如果执迷不悟，蛮干下去，只能是搬起石头打自己的脚。他们再次重申：誓与全国人民一道，全力支持港九爱国同胞的正义斗争，誓作港九爱国同胞的坚强后盾。
    广东省、广州市革命委员会和广东省人民支援港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争委员会的负责同志孔石泉、陈郁、阎仲川等接见了代表团的全体成员。
