Tokyo, May 22 (New China News Agency) - Japanese progressives from various sectors recently issued statements enthusiastically hailing the second anniversary of the issuance of the May 16, 1966 "Notification" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally drafted by Chairman Mao.

The president of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, Nakajima Kenzo, pointed out that Chairman Mao has creatively and comprehensively developed Marxism-Leninism. He said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao has solved the problem of continuing the revolution after the proletariat seizes power and preventing capitalist restoration, thus pointing out the necessary path for all countries' proletariat to defend and consolidate proletarian dictatorship after they seize power. This is Chairman Mao's new great development of Marxism-Leninism.

Nakajima emphasized that Mao Zedong Thought has become the great guiding theory for today's world revolution.

Nakajima said that the Japanese people are jubilant over the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao and firmly believe that the Chinese people will definitely advance to achieve comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. He said that more and more people are recognizing the great significance of this revolution and are inspired by it.

The chairman of the Japan Committee of the Afro-Asian Writers' Association, Shiraishi Bon, said that the "Notification" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, is not only a programmatic document guiding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China but also a historic document of great guiding significance to the world revolution. This is Chairman Mao's new development of Marxism-Leninism and a great contribution to the international proletariat.

Shiraishi said that today's world, as Chairman Mao pointed out in his famous poem, is like this: "The seas churn with angry waves, the continents shake with thunderous roars." This great revolutionary situation is inseparable from the influence and promotion of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

Shiraishi pointed out that it is an extremely important task for revolutionary people to truly master Mao Zedong Thought.

The famous Japanese philosopher Matsumura Kazuhito said that the "Notification" is a great historical document of Marxism-Leninism, a powerful weapon for the proletariat and revolutionary masses to overthrow the capitalist-roaders in socialist conditions. Practice has proven that Chairman Mao's theory of class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat has invincible mighty power. The "Notification" is a great historic document.

Matsumura said that in the "Notification," Chairman Mao teaches us that under the socialist system, those who have infiltrated the party and are walking the capitalist road, given the opportunity, will attempt to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, just as the Khrushchev group did in the Soviet Union. The "Notification" points out how to correctly and sharply criticize those who disguise themselves as Marxists, the revisionists, using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as weapons, and how to mobilize the masses to expose their traitorous true faces. The "Notification" is a brilliant example of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Matsumura pointed out that the Miyamoto revisionist clique of the Japanese Communist Party is a cunning traitor disguised in Marxism-Leninism. They talk about how power comes from the ballot box to peddle their "parliamentary road." If we do not resolutely criticize their treacherous betrayal activities and expose their ugly faces to the masses, the liberation of the Japanese people will not be realized.

Matsumura said that to ensure the bright future of the Japanese people, the only way is to seriously study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, to scientifically investigate and study the current situation in Japan, and to creatively apply Mao Zedong Thought to the specific practice of the Japanese revolution.

The famous Japanese labor movement leader Takano Minoru pointed out that the "Notification" personally drafted by Chairman Mao is a great historical document guiding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and it guarantees the inevitable victory of the Cultural Revolution.

Takano pointed out that Chairman Mao has creatively developed Marxism-Leninism, solving a series of major problems in contemporary proletarian revolution, solving the theoretical and practical problems of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration. This once again proves that Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times.

Takano said that China and the Chinese people are the most reliable and powerful bastion and pillar of the world revolution. We must arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought and struggle for the liberation of the Japanese people.

The chairman of the Kyoto Prefecture (orthodox) branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Kondo Ryozou, said that the May 16, 1966 "Notification" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, is a great historical document of Marxism-Leninism. Chairman Mao has defended and developed Marxism-Leninism, creatively solving the problems of how to conduct class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat and how to prevent capitalist restoration. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times.

Kondo said that the Japanese revolutionary left, through the actual experience of fighting against the Miyamoto revisionist clique of the Japanese Communist Party, deeply feels that the significance of the "Notification" is extremely profound. He said that he went to China twice, in the fall of last year and the spring of this year, and personally saw the great victory and excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which greatly inspired him. Now the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is achieving comprehensive victory, which proves how correct the scientific judgments of the great Chairman Mao are.

Kondo said: Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for the victory of the Japanese revolutionary people. He said that the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has strengthened the confidence of the Japanese revolutionary people in their revolutionary struggle and victory.

The chairman of the Women's Committee of the (orthodox) Japan-China Friendship Association, Saito Kikue, said that two years ago, the "Notification" personally drafted by Chairman Mao sounded the charge for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. In this great historical document, Chairman Mao pointed out the fundamental path to ensure that China's socialist mountains will never change color. It not only infinitely inspired the fighting courage and confidence of 700 million Chinese people but also gave great encouragement to the Japanese people who are steadfast in their anti-American patriotic struggle and the oppressed people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

    日本各界进步朋友欢呼《通知》是划时代的伟大文献
    毛主席捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义  对国际无产阶级作出了伟大的贡献
    中国文化大革命的伟大胜利增强日本革命人民斗争的信心
    新华社二十二日讯　东京消息：日本各界进步朋友最近发表谈话，热烈欢呼毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》发表两周年。
    日中文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏指出，毛主席创造性地、全面地发展了马克思列宁主义。他说，毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，解决了无产阶级取得政权以后，继续进行革命，防止资本主义复辟的问题，从而给各国无产阶级指出了在他们取得政权以后，保卫和巩固无产阶级专政的必经之路。这是毛主席对马克思列宁主义的新的伟大的发展。
    中岛强调指出，毛泽东思想已经成为指导今天世界革命的伟大理论。
    中岛说，日本人民为毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利而欢欣鼓舞，并且相信中国人民一定乘胜前进，取得文化大革命的全面胜利。他说，越来越多的人民认识到了这场革命的伟大意义，并且受到了它的鼓舞。
    亚非作家日本委员会委员长白石凡说，毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央《通知》，不仅是指导中国无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性文献，而且也是对世界革命具有指导意义的历史文献。这是毛主席对马克思列宁主义的新发展、对国际无产阶级的伟大贡献。
    白石说，今天的世界正如毛主席在他的著名诗句中指出的那样：“四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。”这一大好革命形势是和中国无产阶级文化大革命的影响与推动分不开的。
    白石指出，革命人民切实地把毛泽东思想学到手，这是一项极为重要的任务。
    日本著名哲学家松村一人说，《通知》是一部伟大的马克思列宁主义的历史文献，是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级和广大革命群众打倒走资派的有力武器。实践证明：毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下进行阶级斗争的理论，具有不可战胜的强大威力。《通知》是一个划时代的伟大文献。
    松村说，毛主席在这个《通知》中教导我们，在社会主义制度下，那些混进党内的走资本主义道路的当权派，一有机会，就会象赫鲁晓夫集团在苏联所干的那样，企图变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。《通知》给我们指出了如何用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想作为武器，正确地、尖锐地批判那些把自己伪装成马克思主义者的修正主义者，以及如何发动群众揭露他们的叛徒真面目。《通知》是无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的光辉典范。
    松村指出，日共宫本修正主义集团是披着马克思列宁主义外衣的狡猾的叛徒。他们说什么政权是从选票中产生的，来兜售他们的“议会道路”。我们如果不坚决地批判他们阴险的叛卖活动，不在群众面前揭露他们的丑恶面目，日本人民的解放就无法实现。
    松村说，要保证日本人民的光明前途，唯一的途径是，认真地学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，对日本的现状进行科学的调查研究，把毛泽东思想创造性地应用于日本革命的具体实践。
    日本著名工人运动领导人高野实指出，毛主席亲自主持制定的《通知》是指导中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大的历史文件，它保证了无产阶级文化大革命的必然胜利。
    高野指出，毛主席创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，解决了当代无产阶级革命的一系列重大问题，解决了在无产阶级专政下进行革命和防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践问题。这再一次证明毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。
    高野说，中国和中国人民是世界革命最可靠最强大的堡垒和支柱。我们要用毛泽东思想把自己武装起来，为日本人民的解放而奋斗。
    日中友好协会京都府（正统）总部理事长近藤良男说，毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，是一个伟大的马克思列宁主义的历史文件。毛主席捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，创造性地解决了在无产阶级专政下怎样进行阶级斗争，怎样防止资本主义复辟的问题。毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。
    近藤说，日本革命左派，通过反对日共宫本修正主义集团斗争的实际体验，深刻地感到《通知》的意义是极其深远的。他说，我去年秋天和今年春天两次到中国，亲眼看到无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利和一片大好形势，受到极大鼓舞。现在中国无产阶级文化大革命正在获得全面胜利，这个事实证明，伟大的毛主席的科学论断是多么正确。
    近藤说：毛泽东思想是日本革命人民取得胜利的指路明灯。他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，增强了日本革命人民进行革命斗争和获得胜利的信心。
    日中友好协会（正统）妇女委员会委员长斋藤纪江说，两年前，毛主席亲自主持制定的《通知》，吹响了中国无产阶级文化大革命的进军号角。毛主席在这个伟大历史文件中，指出了保证中国的社会主义江山永不变色的根本道路。它不仅无限地激起了七亿中国人民斗争的勇气和信心，而且给坚持反美爱国斗争的日本人民和被压迫的亚非拉人民以无限鼓舞。
