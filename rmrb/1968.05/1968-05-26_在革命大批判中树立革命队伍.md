The great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao, is sweeping away the muddy waters of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and the remnants of the KMT reactionaries with an irresistible force.

The revolutionary cadres of our troupe, in response to Comrade Jiang Qing's call, are concentrating all our efforts to launch a fierce attack on the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line promoted by China's Khrushchev and the former Propaganda Department, Cultural Department, and Beijing Municipal Committee, as well as the class enemies hiding within our ranks under the protection of this black line.

In the course of the struggle, we have taken Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and the May 16, 1966, notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, as well as the summary of the conference on army literary and artistic work convened by Comrade Lin Biao and entrusted to Comrade Jiang Qing, as powerful ideological weapons to attack the class enemies and as battle orders for our charge against the bourgeois headquarters.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To study Marxism, we must not only learn from books, but mainly through class struggle, practical work, and getting close to the workers and peasants, can we truly learn it." It is precisely in the class struggle of revolutionary criticism and establishing a revolutionary team that we study these great documents. Through practice, we have deeply realized that revolutionary criticism and the struggle to establish a revolutionary team are interrelated and inseparable, and are the best classroom for us to apply Chairman Mao's teachings in the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines.

The Beijing Peking Opera Troupe was originally under the control of the "three olds," creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism as a stubborn bridgehead. For more than a decade, under the protection of China's Khrushchev and the "three olds'" counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line and the organizational line of capitulation and surrender, a handful of traitors, spies, die-hard capitalist-roaders, and counter-revolutionaries have infiltrated our ranks. They have always resisted the implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, using every means to sabotage and obstruct the Peking Opera revolution personally led by Comrade Jiang Qing, making the entire troupe chaotic. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, some of them have already been exposed by the revolutionary masses, while others hide in dark corners, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. In short, they are still alive, their hearts are not dead, and they are not willing to accept their failure and annihilation. If we do not expose and overthrow all these class enemies, if we do not thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev and the "three olds'" counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line and the organizational line of capitulation and surrender, and eliminate their poisonous influence, we will not be able to fully implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the Cultural Revolution will not achieve complete victory.

It is with the practical problems of class struggle that we repeatedly study the "Talks," the "Notice," and the "Summary," learning and fighting at the same time, exposing one by one the traitors, spies, and die-hard capitalist-roaders hiding in our ranks. But this is only the beginning of victory. The more arduous and important task is to use these bad elements as negative examples to thoroughly expose and criticize their crimes against Mao Zedong Thought, and to thoroughly expose and criticize the black backers who protect these bad elements. We follow Chairman Mao's teaching: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution. Destruction must be based on reason, and reason is construction. Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." We take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as our guide, take the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines as the key, take the bad elements as negative examples, and take the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line and organizational line promoted by China's Khrushchev and the "three olds" as our target, launching a mass movement to expose and criticize the class enemies and the black backers who protect these bad elements.

We deliberately combine the criticism of bad elements with the exposure of the black line; combine the struggle, criticism, and reform of our unit with the criticism of the biggest capitalist-roader within the party and the "three olds"; combine the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism with the establishment of public spirit and the enhancement of proletarian party spirit, focusing on our unit, thoroughly criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line, and eliminating its poisonous influence in our troupe. The revolutionary masses of the entire troupe, in the struggle, bring their living thoughts and criticism tasks to study and apply Chairman Mao's works extensively, using Chairman Mao's teachings to guide us in analyzing the class struggle situation, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide every battle and every fight. We regard every criticism task as a battle to study, implement, propagate, and defend Mao Zedong Thought, as a battle to defend and build Comrade Jiang Qing's experimental field. Because we can connect with reality and touch the soul, we basically achieve the goal of everyone thinking and speaking, everyone writing big-character posters, and actively participating in the revolutionary criticism. In the course of the struggle, not only have we overthrown and exposed the class enemies, but we have also educated and tempered the broad revolutionary masses, gradually forming a core team loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In the masses, a new high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works has emerged, promoting the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought.

The deepening of revolutionary criticism and the establishment of a revolutionary team will inevitably touch the soul of each individual. Therefore, in carrying out the revolutionary criticism and establishing a revolutionary team, each individual must regard oneself as a revolutionary force while also regarding oneself as a revolutionary object; criticize bad elements and also eliminate the influence of the literary and artistic black line within oneself. Only in this way can our team be revolutionized in organization and thought. Many comrades say: "Only by applying Chairman Mao's teachings in the class struggle can we truly understand Chairman Mao's words, love Chairman Mao more, and be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." Some comrades say: "The year-long struggle of revolutionary criticism and establishing a revolutionary team has educated and raised us in the real class struggle, tested our class stance, promoted the revolutionization of our thoughts, and made us more confident and determined to build Comrade Jiang Qing's experimental field into a truly proletarianized and militarized revolutionary model troupe."

The process of carrying out revolutionary criticism and establishing a revolutionary team is the process of applying Chairman Mao's teachings and the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought. Establishing a revolutionary team is not only about exposing bad elements and purifying our literary and artistic team but also about applying Chairman Mao's teachings in the class struggle to promote the revolutionization of people's thoughts. Therefore, establishing a revolutionary team cannot be carried out in isolation from revolutionary criticism. In fact, only in the class struggle storm of revolutionary criticism can bad elements be cleared out, and the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres can be tempered and tested; only by combining the establishment of a revolutionary team with the carrying out of revolutionary criticism can we achieve the goal of focusing on our troupe, connecting with reality, and thoroughly criticizing the literary and artistic black line, thoroughly criticizing and exposing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line.

The year-long struggle of revolutionary criticism and establishing a revolutionary team has made us deeply taste the sweetness of applying Chairman Mao's teachings in the stormy waves of class struggle. We have realized the importance of struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, strengthening ideological remolding, and promoting the revolutionization of thoughts. We have realized that without thoroughly criticizing and exposing China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line he promoted and its poisonous influence, without exposing all the bad elements hiding in our ranks and overthrowing and exposing them, we will not be able to fully implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, will not be able to build a proletarian literary and artistic team that is forever loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, will not be able to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and will not be able to consolidate the socialist state.

Although revolutionary criticism and the establishment of a revolutionary team have already achieved one victory after another, as we approach the moment of complete victory, the class enemies become more cunning and more rampant, and the class struggle becomes more acute and complex. They have one set of personnel after another; you eliminate one set, and they replace it with another. Therefore, we must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary thoughts from the right and the ultra-"left," resolutely oppose right opportunism, right capitulationism, and right splitism, and thoroughly smash the rightist reversal wind.

Now, we are proceeding with firm confidence and determination, taking the "Talks," the "Notice," and the "Summary" as our ideological weapons, to deepen the struggle of revolutionary criticism and establishing a revolutionary team. We are determined to build Comrade Jiang Qing's experimental field into a truly proletarianized and militarized revolutionary model troupe, a fighting team that strives to learn, enthusiastically propagates, loyally implements, and bravely defends Mao Zedong Thought; a propaganda team that forever serves the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serves socialism.

    在革命大批判中树立革命队伍
    北京京剧一团革命委员会
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，正沿着我们伟大领袖毛主席指引的方向，以排山倒海之势，荡涤着资产阶级及一切剥削阶级的污泥浊水，荡涤着国民党反动派的一切残渣余孽。
    我团的无产阶级革命派，响应江青同志的号召，正集中全力对中国赫鲁晓夫和旧中宣部、旧文化部、旧北京市委所推行的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，以及在这条黑线庇护下，隐藏在我们队伍中的阶级敌人展开猛烈的进攻。
    在战斗过程中，我们把毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》和中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，以及去年五月二十九日发表的《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》，当作向阶级敌人进攻的强大思想武器，当作我们向资产阶级司令部冲锋陷阵的战斗的号令。
    毛主席教导我们：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”我们正是在革命大批判和树立革命队伍的阶级斗争中来学习这些伟大文献的。通过实践，我们深刻认识到，革命的大批判和树立革命队伍的斗争是互相联系、不可分割的，也是我们在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的最好的课堂。
    北京京剧一团原来是在“三旧”控制下，为资本主义复辟大造舆论的一个顽固的桥头堡。十多年来，在中国赫鲁晓夫及“三旧”的反革命修正主义文艺黑线和招降纳叛的组织路线的庇护下，一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和反革命分子混进了我们的队伍。他们一贯抗拒执行毛主席的革命路线，千方百计地破坏和阻挠江青同志亲自领导的京剧革命，把整个剧团搞得乌烟瘴气。在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，他们当中的有些人已经被革命群众揪出来了，有些则躲到阴暗的角落里窥测方向，伺机反扑。总之，他们人还在，心不死，决不甘心于自己的失败和灭亡。如果我们不把这些阶级敌人统统揪出来斗倒批臭，不彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫及“三旧”推行的反革命修正主义文艺黑线和招降纳叛的组织路线，并肃清其流毒，就不能很好地贯彻毛主席的革命路线，文化大革命就不能取得全面的胜利。
    我们就是这样带着阶级斗争中的现实问题，反复学习《讲话》《通知》《纪要》等伟大文献，边学习，边战斗，把隐藏在我们队伍中的叛徒、特务和一小撮顽固不化的走资派，一个个地揪了出来。但是，这还仅仅是胜利的开始，更艰巨，更重要的任务是要以这些坏人为反面教员，彻底揭发和批判他们反对毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，彻底揭露和批判庇护这些坏人的黑后台。我们遵照毛主席关于“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了”的教导，以毛主席的最新指示为指针，以两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争为纲，以坏人为反面教员，以批判中国赫鲁晓夫及“三旧”推行的反革命修正主义的文艺路线和组织路线为靶子，对阶级敌人及庇护这些坏人的黑后台展开了群众性的大揭发，大批判。
    我们有目的地把批坏人与挖黑线结合起来；把本单位的斗批改与批判党内最大的走资派及“三旧”结合起来；把斗私批修、克服资产阶级派性与大立公字、增强无产阶级党性结合起来，立足于本单位，彻底批判反革命修正主义文艺黑线，并肃清其在我团的流毒。全团革命群众，在斗争中带着活思想和批判任务，大学大用毛主席著作，用毛主席的教导指导我们去分析阶级斗争形势，用毛泽东思想指导我们的每一个战役，每一次战斗。我们把每一个批判任务，都看作是学习、执行、宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想的战斗，是捍卫和建设江青同志试验田的战斗。由于能够联系实际，触及灵魂，基本上做到了人人动脑开口，人人写大字报，主动积极地参加革命大批判。在战斗过程中，不仅斗倒批臭了阶级敌人，而且教育锻炼了广大革命群众，逐渐形成了一支忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的革命路线的骨干队伍，在群众中出现了学习毛主席著作的新高潮，促进了毛泽东思想的大普及。
    革命大批判和树立革命队伍的深入发展，势必要触及到每个人的灵魂。因此，在开展革命的大批判和树立革命队伍中，每个人既要把自己当作革命的力量，同时又要把自己当作革命的对象；既批判坏人，也肃清文艺黑线在自己身上的流毒。只有这样，才能使我们的队伍在组织上革命化，在思想上也革命化。不少同志说：“只有在阶级斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，才能真正理解毛主席的话，才会更加热爱毛主席，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的革命路线。”有些同志说：“一年来的革命大批判和树立革命队伍的斗争，使我们在现实的阶级斗争中受到了教育和提高，同时也考验了我们的阶级立场，促进了我们思想的革命化，使我们更加有信心有决心把江青同志的试验田，建设成为真正无产阶级化、战斗化的革命样板团。”
    开展革命大批判和树立革命队伍的过程，就是活学活用毛主席著作，毛泽东思想大普及的过程。树立革命队伍不仅是要把坏人揪出来，纯洁我们的文艺队伍，而且要在阶级斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，促进人的思想革命化。因此，树立革命队伍不能脱离了革命大批判去孤立地进行。事实上，只有在革命大批判的阶级斗争的暴风雨中，才能把坏人清理出来，才能锻炼和考察广大革命群众和革命干部；也只有在树立革命队伍中结合开展革命的大批判，才能作到立足本团，联系实际，狠批深挖文艺黑线，把反革命修正主义路线批深批透。
    一年来的革命大批判和树立革命队伍的斗争，使我们在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，深深尝到了活学活用毛主席著作的甜头。认识到斗私批修，加强思想改造，促进思想革命化的重要性，认识到不把中国赫鲁晓夫及其推行的反革命修正主义路线及其流毒批深批透，不把隐藏在我们队伍中的坏人统统揪出来斗倒斗臭，就不能很好地贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就不能建立一支永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席革命路线的无产阶级文艺队伍，就不能巩固无产阶级专政，就不能巩固社会主义江山。
    革命的大批判和树立革命队伍，虽然已经从一个胜利走向一个胜利，但是，越接近于全面胜利的关键时刻，阶级敌人就越狡猾，越猖狂，阶级斗争也就越尖锐复杂。他们有一套一套的班子，你搞掉一套，它又换上一套。因此，我们必须紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，彻底批判来自右的和极“左”方面的资产阶级反动思想，坚决反对右倾机会主义，右倾投降主义，右倾分裂主义，彻底粉碎右倾翻案的妖风。
    现在，我们正以坚定的信心和决心，以《讲话》《通知》《纪要》为思想武器，把革命的大批判和树立革命队伍的战斗深入地进行下去。我们决心把江青同志的试验田建设成为真正无产阶级化的战斗化的革命样板团，建设成为努力学习、热情宣传、忠实执行、勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想的战斗队；建设成为永远为工农兵服务，为社会主义服务的毛泽东思想的宣传队。
