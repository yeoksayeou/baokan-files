In the unprecedentedly good situation both internationally and domestically, amidst the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army across the nation, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, are celebrating the glorious day of the international labor movement—May Day—with high spirits and a fighting posture.

Our great teacher and great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, on the evening of May 1, together with 500,000 military and civilians in the capital, joyously celebrated May Day. This great piece of news spread to all parts of the country, causing a wave of joy across the nation. Millions of military and civilians enthusiastically cheered: Chairman Mao is in excellent health, and he celebrated the May Day night with Vice Chairman Lin and the capital's military and civilians, which is the greatest care and encouragement for the people of the entire nation. They shouted a thousand and ten thousand times: "Long live the great teacher Chairman Mao! Long live forever!"

The millions of military and civilians across the nation resolutely declared that they would, under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launch even more ferocious attacks on the enemies of the proletariat, advance victoriously, develop the great situation, and carry the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, providing even stronger support to the revolutionary struggles of the proletariat and oppressed peoples and nations around the world.

During the celebration of May Day, most provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have successively established revolutionary committees. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes are held throughout the cities and countryside, presenting a thriving revolutionary scene everywhere. In the provincial capitals and autonomous region capitals such as Guangzhou, Wuhan, Shenyang, Chengdu, Xi'an, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Zhengzhou, Changsha, Nanning, Jinan, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Hefei, Nanchang, Fuzhou, Harbin, Changchun, Lanzhou, Xining, Yinchuan, Urumqi, Guiyang, Kunming, and Lhasa, as well as in cities and rural areas across the nation, the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals are joyfully holding various celebrations. Some are holding study sessions on Chairman Mao's works, resolving to better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle; some are holding revolutionary criticism meetings, using fierce attacks on China's Khrushchev and other capitalist roaders within the Party to commemorate the day; some are holding military-civilian joint celebrations, resolving to further strengthen military-civilian unity and fortify our great steel wall; some are holding discussions and seminars, seriously studying the important editorials in the People's Daily, Red Flag, and Liberation Army Daily, "Advance Victoriously." Many revolutionary committees and local military leaders have gone to factories, rural areas, schools, and offices at the grassroots level to celebrate the day with the revolutionary masses. In the celebrations held across the country, the broad masses of military and civilians, with the joy of victory and the spirit of struggle, repeatedly raised their fists and shouted: "Workers of the world, unite! Workers of the world, unite with the oppressed peoples and nations! Firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries! Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao! Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China! Long live Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought! Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

Our great leader Chairman Mao recently taught us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the reactionary Kuomintang led by the broad revolutionary masses, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The military and civilians across the country, while welcoming and celebrating May Day, have seriously studied Chairman Mao's brilliant directive, gaining a deeper understanding of the great significance and class content of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They said, the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to complete victory, the more complex and profound the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads becomes. We must firmly remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle," closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasp the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, resolutely oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, smash the rightist reversal wind, and launch even more ferocious attacks on the enemies of the proletariat without stopping. In the celebrations held across the country, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army unanimously declared that they would fan the flames of revolutionary criticism even higher. They said, we must thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev and other top capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents in various places, fight them down and expose them, clean up the poison of revisionism they spread in various aspects, and dig out all hidden traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries, further develop the great situation, and carry the great political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, initiated and led by Chairman Mao, through to the end, seizing the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The military and civilians across the country emphasized that to thoroughly defeat the enemies of the proletariat, we must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, distinguish between enemy contradictions and contradictions among the people, be good at uniting our class forces, be good at uniting and winning over allies, strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, and unite the vast majority. The responsible person of the revolutionary workers' congress in Wuhan said at the celebration meeting, we revolutionary workers must, on the basis of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, unite more closely, hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, and in the struggle, continuously consolidate and develop the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the revolutionary cadres, and advance along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in the Chengdu region united as one, jointly fighting against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Southwest and Sichuan. The great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the revolutionary cadres are continuously developing. When celebrating the glorious day of the international labor movement, they unanimously declared that they would, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching, "The proletariat not only liberates itself but also liberates all mankind," unite all those who can be united, form an even more vast revolutionary army, keep the spearhead of the struggle always aimed at the handful of class enemies, and on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, consolidate and develop the great alliance and the three-in-one combination, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

"Military-civilian unity is like one person, who can stand against us?" The various celebrations held by the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the revolutionary masses in the days of celebration fully demonstrated the close relationship between the broad masses of military and civilians. They unanimously wished our great leader Chairman Mao eternal life and sang "The East is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" together. In the celebrations held across the country, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses repeatedly shouted: "Learn from the great People's Liberation Army of China! Salute the great People's Liberation Army of China!" The broad masses of soldiers enthusiastically shouted: "Salute the revolutionary cadres! Salute the workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary Red Guards!" The broad masses of military and civilians also shouted together: "Long live the heroic Chinese people! Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat! Down with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek! Liberate Taiwan!" The soldiers of the "Support the Left and Love the People Model Platoon" held meetings with the local revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, carried out revolutionary criticism, fought against class enemies, and demonstrated the powerful force of military-civilian unity in fighting against the enemy. The soldiers of the "Red Vanguard Company" of the Guangzhou Military Region, on the eve of May Day, held a study session on applying Chairman Mao's latest directives with the local militias and revolutionary masses. The soldiers said, we are the builders of the South China Wall and the defenders of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must have the "loyalty" to the great leader Chairman Mao in our hearts, heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, and resolutely smash all sabotage activities by class enemies. In the steel city of Anshan, where the revolutionary committee has been established, the broad masses of soldiers enthusiastically carried out activities to support the government and love the people, going deep into factories, shops, and streets to participate in labor. The local revolutionary masses launched enthusiastic activities to support the military. The military and civilians across the country declared that they would hold high the great banner of "supporting the military and loving the people," strengthen military-civilian unity, protect the newly born revolutionary committees, and consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," the revolutionary masses in many places stood firm at their production posts on the day of celebration, using new production achievements to celebrate the day of the international labor movement. The revolutionary workers of the Jingxing Coal Mine, who have exceeded the national production plan for sixteen consecutive months from January last year to April this year, launched a socialist labor competition between mines and teams on May Day, increasing the daily output of the entire mine by 39% compared to the average daily output in April. The members of the revolutionary committees at various levels of Anshan Steel, went deep into factories, workshops, and sections, grasping the revolution and promoting production with the broad revolutionary masses. They treated factories, workshops, and sections as both production battlefields and revolutionary criticism battlefields, launching fierce attacks on China's Khrushchev and his agents. The revolutionary workers of the second rough rolling mill of Anshan Steel achieved outstanding production results on May Day. The Guiyang Cotton Mill, which achieved revolutionary great unity the earliest, solemnly held a mobilization meeting during the celebration of May Day, expressing their determination to better implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." The revolutionary workers of the Harbin Railway Bureau system, with the excellent production results of an average daily loading rate increased by 7% compared to the first quarter, joyously celebrated May Day. On that day, they held celebration meetings, expressing their determination to advance victoriously and continue to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

Our great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "The people who have already won the revolution should aid the struggle of the people who are still striving for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers across the country, while celebrating the glorious day of the international labor movement, reviewed Chairman Mao's great teaching, studied Chairman Mao's recent statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence, and unanimously declared that they would not disappoint the expectations of the proletariat and oppressed peoples and nations around the world, and better fulfill their great internationalist duty of the proletariat. In the celebrations held across the country, the broad masses of military and civilians repeatedly raised their fists and shouted: "Down with U.S. imperialism headed by America! Down with modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique! Down with the reactionaries of all countries! Firmly support the anti-American national salvation war of the Vietnamese people! Firmly support the struggle of American blacks against violence! Salute the Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations of all countries! Firmly support the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle of all Marxist-Leninists around the world!" The revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army across the country resolutely declared that they would hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, advance victoriously, carry the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, build our great socialist motherland even stronger, and provide even stronger support to the revolutionary struggles of the proletariat and oppressed peoples and nations around the world.

    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”各地军民在迎接和欢庆“五一”国际劳动节的时候，认真地学习了毛主席的这一光辉指示，更加深刻地认识到无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义和阶级内容。他们说，无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，越是复杂，越是深刻。我们一定要牢记伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，粉碎右倾翻案妖风，不停顿地向无产阶级的敌人展开更加猛烈的进攻。在各地举行的庆祝活动中，广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众和人民解放军指战员，一致表示要把革命大批判的烈火烧得更旺。他们说，我们一定要把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在各地的代理人彻底批深批透，斗倒斗臭，肃清他们在各方面散布的修正主义流毒，把隐藏的叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子统统挖出来，进一步发展大好形势，把毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    各地军民着重指出，为了彻底战胜无产阶级的敌人，我们一定要牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，区别敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，善于团结自己的阶级队伍，善于团结和争取同盟军，加强工农联盟，团结绝大多数人。武汉地区革命工人代表大会的负责人在庆祝集会上说，我们革命工人一定要在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的基础上，更加紧密地团结起来，手携手，肩并肩，在斗争中不断巩固和发展无产阶级革命派的革命大联合和革命三结合，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线奋勇前进。成都地区的无产阶级革命派、革命群众和人民解放军指战员，团结一致，共同对敌，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在西南和四川的代理人发动不停顿的进攻。无产阶级革命派的革命大联合和革命三结合不断发展。他们在欢庆全世界无产阶级和劳动人民团结战斗的光辉节日时，一致表示要遵照毛主席“无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类”的教导，团结一切可以团结的人们，组成更加浩浩荡荡的革命大军，把斗争矛头始终对准一小撮阶级敌人，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上，巩固和发展革命大联合和革命三结合，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。

    在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针指引下，各地许多革命群众在节日里坚守生产岗位，以新的生产成就来庆祝无产阶级和劳动人民团结战斗的节日。从去年一月到今年四月连续十六个月超额完成国家生产计划的井陉煤矿的革命职工，在“五一”这一天开展了矿井之间、班组之间的社会主义劳动竞赛，使全矿的日产量比四月份平均日产量提高了百分之三十九。鞍钢各级革命委员会的成员，深入厂矿、车间、工段，同广大革命职工一道，狠抓革命，猛促生产。他们把厂矿、车间、工段既作为生产斗争的战场，又作为革命大批判的战场，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人发动了猛烈进攻。鞍钢第二初轧厂的广大革命职工，在“五一”这一天创造了出色的生产成绩。最早实现革命大联合的贵阳棉纺厂在庆祝“五一”国际劳动节的时候，隆重地举行誓师大会，表示要更好地贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。哈尔滨铁路局系统的革命职工，带着四月份平均每天装车数比第一季度增长百分之七的优异生产成绩，欢度了“五一”国际劳动节。在“五一”这一天，他们纷纷举行庆祝会，表示要乘胜前进，继续夺取革命、生产双胜利。
