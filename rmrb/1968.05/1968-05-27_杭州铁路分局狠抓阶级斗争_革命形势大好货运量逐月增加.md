The revolutionary committee of the Hangzhou Railway Bureau, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "never forget class struggle," and with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support troops, has led the broad revolutionary masses of workers to launch a fierce offensive against class enemies. They have conducted a sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism campaign, and the revolutionary and production situations have become increasingly better. Currently, all more than seventy large and small stations and sections under the jurisdiction of the entire bureau have established revolutionary committees or revolutionary leading groups. The transportation and production situation is better each month. In April of this year, the cargo volume increased by twelve percent compared to March, and in the first ten days of May, there was a significant increase compared to the end of April.
