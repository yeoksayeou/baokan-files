	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Never forget class struggle." Two years ago, Chairman Mao personally directed the formulation of the great historical document—the May 16, 1966 Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China—which is the battle cry for the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses to march against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions. Revolution is struggle; to make a revolution, one must engage in class struggle. Forgetting class struggle is forgetting the revolution, forgetting state power, and forgetting the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao and a betrayal of Mao Zedong Thought. The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years has further proven that Chairman Mao's theory on class and class struggle is extremely brilliant, extremely correct, and extremely great.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao points out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution launched by the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses under the leadership of the Communist Party of China against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The handful of top capitalist-roaders within the Party, such as Liu Shaoqi, those traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the Party, are representatives of the Kuomintang reactionaries. They are representatives of imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They wave the red flag to oppose the red flag, attempting to restore capitalism in China. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has exposed this handful of class enemies, thwarted their plots, consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ensured that our broad laboring people do not suffer twice and do not bear the burden twice.

	The poor and lower-middle peasants of Wugong Village in Raoyang County, under Chairman Mao's call to "organize," have been walking the bright path of socialist agricultural collectivization since 1943. Over the past 25 years, we have followed the socialist path indicated by Chairman Mao and have never taken a wrong step. Over the past 25 years, we have experienced one struggle after another between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads. Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Hebei Province have tried every means to restore capitalism in Wugong Village. We, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, have established agricultural cooperatives according to Chairman Mao's instructions; they shouted that "agricultural cooperatives are not the direction of development," attempting to cut off our cooperatives. We have followed Chairman Mao's teaching that politics is the command and the soul, insisting on the "Four Firsts" and implementing the leadership of proletarian politics; they, however, wanted us to pursue "material incentives" and implement "economic leadership." The landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in the village also echoed Liu Shaoqi, opposing Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, dreaming of restoring capitalism. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have seen through and smashed their tricks. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, these class enemies did not give up. They sneaked around, playing double-faced counter-revolutionary tricks, attempting to sow discord among revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants, trying to create divisions. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Grasp revolution, promote production." The enemies of the proletariat spread anarchism, disrupt labor discipline, and sabotage production. The broad revolutionary masses study and apply Chairman Mao's works; a handful of class enemies tell yellow stories, preparing public opinion for their restoration of capitalism. We criticize the capitalist reactionary line; they use sleight-of-hand tactics, stirring up a rightist wind of reversing verdicts. In a word, these bad elements always and everywhere try to seize the power from the poor and lower-middle peasants. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have timely exposed the plots and tricks of the class enemies, smashed their repeated arrogant counter-attacks, dragged them out, and subjected them to struggle and criticism, implementing dictatorship over them. Through this struggle, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has taken root in people's minds, and the poor and lower-middle peasants' awareness of class struggle and the two-line struggle has greatly increased.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never reconcile themselves to their defeat; they will make their last struggle." The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to complete victory, the more complex and profound the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads becomes. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further enhance our awareness of class struggle and the two-line struggle, and actively and persistently launch attacks on the class enemies. We must expose the hidden class enemies, thoroughly and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, and politically, ideologically, and theoretically criticize and expose the class enemies. We must thoroughly eliminate their poison in all aspects, defend the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, consolidate and develop the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ensure that our great motherland remains red forever.

    牢记毛主席的教导狠抓阶级斗争
    全国农业劳动模范
    河北省革命委员会副主任  耿长锁
    毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”两年前，毛主席亲自主持制定的伟大的历史文件——中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》，就是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级和广大革命群众向资产阶级和一切剥削阶级进军的战斗号令。革命就是斗争，要革命就要进行阶级斗争，忘记了阶级斗争，就是忘记了革命，忘记了政权，忘记了无产阶级专政，就是对毛主席最大的不忠，就是背叛了毛泽东思想。两年来无产阶级文化大革命的实践，进一步证明了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的学说无比英明，无比正确，无比伟大。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派，那些混进党内的叛徒、特务和反革命分子，就是国民党反动派的代表人物，就是帝国主义、资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右的代表人物，他们打着红旗反红旗，妄图在中国复辟资本主义。我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，揪出了这一小撮阶级敌人，使他们的阴谋没有得逞，巩固了无产阶级专政，保证了我们广大劳动人民不吃二遍苦，不受二遍罪。
    我们饶阳县五公村的贫下中农在毛主席“组织起来”的伟大号召下，从一九四三年开始，逐步走上了农业集体化的社会主义光明大道。二十五年来，我们走毛主席指引的社会主义道路，没有走过错路。二十五年来，我们经历了一场场严重的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在河北省的代理人千方百计地想在五公村复辟资本主义。我们广大贫下中农遵照毛主席的指示办农业合作社；他们大叫“农业合作社不是发展方向”，想一刀砍掉我们的合作社。我们遵循毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂的教导，坚持“四个第一”，实行无产阶级政治挂帅；他们却要我们搞“物质刺激”，实行“经济挂帅”。村里的地、富、反、坏、右也和中国赫鲁晓夫一呼一应，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，梦想复辟资本主义。我们贫下中农用毛泽东思想武装起来，识破和粉碎了他们的鬼花招。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，这些阶级敌人还不死心，他们东钻西窜，大耍反革命两面派手法，挑拨革命干部和贫下中农的关系，妄图制造分裂。毛主席教导我们：“抓革命，促生产”。无产阶级的敌人就散布无政府主义，破坏劳动纪律，破坏生产。广大革命群众活学活用毛主席著作，一小撮阶级敌人就讲黄色故事，为他们复辟资本主义作舆论准备。我们批判资产阶级反动路线，他们又用偷天换日的手法，刮起右倾翻案妖风。一句话，这些坏家伙时时、处处想从贫下中农手里夺印把子。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大贫下中农，及时识破了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，粉碎了他们一次又一次的猖狂反扑，把他们揪了出来，进行了批斗，实行了专政。通过这场斗争，战无不胜的毛泽东思想在人们头脑里扎下了根，贫下中农的阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高了。
    毛主席教导我们说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，越是复杂，越是深刻。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步提高阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟，主动地持久地向阶级敌人发动进攻，把暗藏的阶级敌人揪出来，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，从政治上、思想上、理论上把阶级敌人批倒批臭，彻底肃清他们在各方面散布的流毒，保卫无产阶级文化大革命的伟大战果，巩固和发展无产阶级专政，使我们伟大的祖国千秋万代永不变色。
