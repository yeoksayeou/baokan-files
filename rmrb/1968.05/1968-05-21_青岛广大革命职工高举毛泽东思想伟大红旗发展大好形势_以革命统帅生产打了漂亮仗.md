Workers in Qingdao Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought to Develop a Great Situation
With Revolution Leading Production, They Have Won a Brilliant Victory

Last year, the total industrial output value increased by 11.9 percent compared to the previous year. This year, the industrial production level in the city has been rising month by month, and the daily production level in April increased by 3.72 percent compared to March. There are more than 3,000 major technological innovations and technological revolution projects.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Jinan on the 20th, the proletarian revolutionary factions on the industrial front in Qingdao have been in power for more than a year. They have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, leading the broad masses of revolutionary workers to firmly grasp class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. With revolution leading production, they have won brilliant victories on both the revolutionary and production fronts, and the situation is increasingly good.

Last year, Qingdao's total industrial output value increased by 11.9 percent compared to 1966, completing the state plan three days ahead of schedule. The output of most major products exceeded the state plan, product quality was stable and improving, and costs were reduced. This year, as the revolutionary situation continues to improve, production has also developed steadily. In the first quarter, the industrial production level in the city has been rising month by month, and the daily production level in April increased by 3.72 percent compared to March. In the process of seizing the revolution and promoting production, the broad masses of revolutionary workers have actively carried out technological innovation and technological revolution activities, achieving abundant results. According to incomplete statistics, since last year, the city has implemented more than 3,000 major technological innovation and technological revolution projects.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolution can change everything," "Revolution is to liberate productive forces, and revolution is to promote the development of productive forces." The great situation in Qingdao's industrial production during the Cultural Revolution fully proves that Chairman Mao's wise judgment is absolutely correct, fully proving that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of China's social productive forces.

The great situation of seizing the revolution and promoting production on the industrial front in Qingdao has the following characteristics:

First, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp class struggle, carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, and actively launch fierce attacks on class enemies. They use class struggle to drive production struggle, developing a great situation.

After the proletarian revolutionary factions on the industrial front in Qingdao took power, the class enemies, unwilling to face their doom, attempted to disrupt production to achieve their evil goal of overthrowing the proletarian revolutionary regime. The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionary workers, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of struggle, always aiming the spearhead of struggle at the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shandong and Qingdao, as well as all class enemies. They closely combine revolutionary criticism with the actual class struggle in their units, exposing a group of traitors, spies, and remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries who had infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, striking them hard, and smashing their rightist reversal wind and evil plots to disrupt production. The broad masses of revolutionary workers, holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism, while fighting against a handful of class enemies, thoroughly criticize the revisionist line of running enterprises advocated by Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of top capitalist roaders within the party, such as "production first," "material incentives," and "profit-oriented." They firmly establish Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, advocating the revolutionary idea of emphasizing proletarian politics and producing for the revolution, and repel the anarchist and counter-revolutionary economist winds stirred up by class enemies.

Second, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is flourishing, Mao Zedong Thought is unprecedentedly popularized, and Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" has deeply rooted in the revolutionary masses.

The broad masses of revolutionary workers, with deep proletarian feelings of love for the great leader Chairman Mao, universally organize various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and put studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the forefront of all work. Through criticizing and repudiating oneself and modifying and establishing the public, they promote the thought revolutionization of people, greatly enhancing the awareness of class struggle and line struggle. The broad masses of revolutionary workers regard seizing the revolution and promoting production as an expression of their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao. Everyone puts the boundless enthusiasm unleashed in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production, solving many old and difficult problems that could not be solved in the past, creating many miracles, and performing a series of triumphant songs of Mao Zedong Thought.

Third, in the process of seizing the revolution and promoting production, they firmly break the revisionist fallacies of "expert management" and "crawling," resolutely implement Chairman Mao's mass line, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit, effectively promoting the development of production.

In the past, due to the power of a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, the policy of "expert management" was implemented, restricting the hands and feet of the masses, and the socialist enthusiasm and wisdom of the broad masses of revolutionary workers could not be fully displayed. After the proletarian revolutionary factions on the industrial front in Qingdao took power, under the guidance of the brilliant thought of the "Anshan Constitution" formulated by Chairman Mao, revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary technical personnel implement the combination of the three, dare to think and dare to act, creating many new achievements that bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" could not even dream of. The broad masses of revolutionary workers at the Qingdao Steam Turbine Factory, inspired by Chairman Mao's great order to "break superstition and liberate thought," took only three months to successfully trial-manufacture China's first 3,000-kilowatt combined quick-installation type new steam turbine.

Currently, the broad masses of revolutionary workers on the industrial front in Qingdao, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, are advancing victoriously. They are determined to make greater contributions in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    青岛广大革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗发展大好形势
    以革命统帅生产打了漂亮仗
    去年工业总产值比前年增长百分之十一点九。今年第一季度全市工业生产水平逐月上升，四月份日产水平又比三月份增长百分之三点七二。重大技术革新和技术革命项目有三千多项
    据新华社济南二十日电　青岛工业战线无产阶级革命派掌权一年多来，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，带领广大革命职工狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，以革命统帅生产，在革命和生产两条战线上都打了漂亮仗，形势一派大好，越来越好。
    去年，青岛市工业总产值比一九六六年增长百分之十一点九，提前三天完成了国家计划。大多数主要产品的产量都超额完成了国家计划，产品质量稳定上升，成本也有下降。今年以来，随着革命形势越来越好，生产也不断发展。第一季度全市工业生产水平逐月上升，四月份日产水平又比三月份增长百分之三点七二。在抓革命、促生产中，广大革命职工还积极开展技术革新和技术革命活动，取得了丰硕成果。据不完全统计，去年以来，全市搞的重大技术革新和技术革命项目就有三千多项。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命能改变一切”，“革命就是解放生产力，革命就是促进生产力的发展”。青岛市的工业生产在文化大革命中出现的大好形势，充分证明了毛主席的英明论断无比正确，充分证明了无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。
    青岛市工业战线抓革命、促生产的大好形势有以下一些特点：
    第一，广大无产阶级革命派和革命职工，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，主动地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，以阶级斗争带动生产斗争，发展了大好形势。
    青岛工业战线的无产阶级革命派掌权后，阶级敌人不甘心他们的灭亡，妄想以破坏生产来达到他们颠覆无产阶级革命政权的罪恶目的。无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，始终把斗争矛头对准中国赫鲁晓夫及其在山东和青岛的代理人以及一切阶级敌人，把革命大批判和本单位的阶级斗争实际紧密结合起来，挖出了一批混入革命队伍的叛徒、特务和国民党反动派的残渣余孽，狠狠地打击了他们，粉碎了他们的右倾翻案妖风和破坏生产的罪恶阴谋。广大革命职工高举革命批判的大旗，在向一小撮阶级敌人进行斗争的同时，大破中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派推行的“生产第一”、“物质刺激”、“利润挂帅”等修正主义办企业路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，树立突出无产阶级政治，为革命而生产的革命思想，击退了阶级敌人刮起的无政府主义和反革命经济主义妖风。
    第二，活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动蓬勃开展，毛泽东思想空前大普及，毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在革命群众中深深地扎了根。
    广大革命职工怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚无产阶级感情，普遍举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，把活学活用毛泽东思想摆在一切工作的首位。他们通过斗私批修，破私立公，促进了人的思想革命化，大大提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。广大革命职工把抓好革命，促好生产作为无限忠于毛主席的表现。大家把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲用到生产上去，解决了许多过去不能解决的老大难问题，创造了许多奇迹，奏出了一曲曲毛泽东思想的凯歌。
    第三，在抓革命、促生产中狠破修正主义的“专家治厂”、“爬行主义”等反革命谬论，坚决贯彻毛主席的群众路线，相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，有力地促进了生产的发展。
    过去由于党内一小撮走资派掌权，实行“专家治厂”，束缚了群众的手脚，广大革命职工的社会主义积极性和智慧不能得到充分发挥。青岛工业战线无产阶级革命派掌权后，在毛主席制定的“鞍钢宪法”的光辉思想指引下，革命工人、革命干部和革命技术人员实行三结合，敢想，敢干，创造出许多资产阶级“专家”“权威”梦想不到的新成就。青岛汽轮机厂的广大革命职工，在毛主席“破除迷信、解放思想”的伟大号令鼓舞下，仅仅用三个月的时间，就试制成功了我国第一台三千瓩组合快装式新型汽轮机。
    目前，青岛工业战线广大革命职工，在毛主席的一系列最新指示指引下，正乘胜前进，他们决心在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，作出更大的贡献。
