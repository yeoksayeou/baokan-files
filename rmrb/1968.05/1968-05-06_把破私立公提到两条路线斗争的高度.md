In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I have come to realize that to closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao and become a genuine proletarian revolutionary, to carry the socialist revolution through to the end, one must always adhere to the "two yardsticks" of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, and the "two mirrors" of "extreme responsibility to work" and "extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people." Use these to measure and reflect on one's actions and thoughts for loyalty to Chairman Mao. Let the spirit of "loyalty" permeate the soul, guide life, and direct actions.

The "two yardsticks" and "two mirrors" must be used to measure and reflect in the implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

In the past few years, through repeated study of the "Three Articles," I found the "two yardsticks" of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, and the "two mirrors" of "extreme responsibility to work" and "extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people." I often used these to measure my actions and reflect on my thoughts, which had a significant impact on transforming my thoughts and doing a good job. However, after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, I had some misunderstandings about Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and often could not keep up with his great strategic deployments. One day, several dozen comrades came from outside and asked me to share my experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works, especially how I had continued the revolution by studying and applying Chairman Mao's works during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They also asked about my new experiences in using the "two yardsticks" and "two mirrors." This question caught me off guard. Several dozen people clapped enthusiastically, making my heart race. Just as I was at a loss, a leader sitting nearby suggested I prepare first, which allowed me to come down from the stage.

This incident shook me greatly. After returning, I couldn't eat or sleep properly. I kept thinking: Why hadn't I considered this question before? In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, how should I use the "two yardsticks" and "two mirrors" to continue the revolution? In the new situation, how can I be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and keep up with him?

With this question in mind, I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's theories, lines, policies, methods, and principles on continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. I realized: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, raises the extremely important issue of continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. It resolves the contradictions between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, between the two roads. This is a major issue concerning the fate of the country and the future of humanity. In such a great revolutionary struggle, whether one can firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the fundamental issue of whether a revolutionary is loyal to Chairman Mao. In the past, I always thought: Using the spirit of the "two yardsticks" and "two mirrors" to tend the fire, the fire burns brightly and the coal burns efficiently; using it to treat comrades, one can be extremely enthusiastic and brotherly; using it to transform thoughts, one can effectively fight against selfishness. Continuing like this, following Chairman Mao would be no problem. However, looking back at the path I have taken in studying Chairman Mao's works and transforming my worldview, I deeply feel: In today's deepening socialist revolution, the transformation of a revolutionary's thoughts, if limited to generally fighting against selfishness and establishing public spirit in everyday work, is obviously not enough. While general work and thought problems must be solved, for a revolutionary, the most important thing is to be concerned with state affairs, with class struggle, and with the struggle between the two lines. One must use the "two yardsticks" and "two mirrors" to measure and reflect in the implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Only by consciously elevating the transformation of thoughts and the completion of work to the level of the struggle between the two lines, to the level of loyalty to Chairman Mao, can one truly achieve "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people.

Last year, when I was supporting leftist activities in Yǐn Gé Zhuāng, the villagers had differing opinions about a cadre. Some wanted to overthrow him, saying that Yǐn Gé Zhuāng would not improve unless this cadre was removed; others strongly defended him, saying that if this cadre was removed, the enemies would be pleased. The two factions were strongly opposed to each other. What should be done? I followed Chairman Mao's teachings and first conducted investigations and research among the masses. Through the investigation, we learned that this cadre was an active organizer of collective members studying Chairman Mao's works, cared about collective affairs, dared to uphold principles, and dared to expose and struggle against bad people and bad deeds. He only made some mistakes due to simple and rough work methods. The class enemies incited some masses, trying to take the opportunity to overthrow him. We believed that although this cadre had serious mistakes, he was not a capitalist-roader and should be persuaded by the masses to stand up and revolutionize.

Someone knew we wanted this cadre to stand up and spread the rumor: "×× is the capitalist-roader we masses have exposed. No matter who it is, trying to reverse the case for ×× is siding with the capitalist-roaders within the party, and there will be no good outcome!" Hearing these words, I thought: It is right to let this cadre stand up and revolutionize, but this cadre has serious mistakes, and so many people oppose him. If things go wrong, I might not be able to stand firm in Yǐn Gé Zhuāng. As soon as this thought emerged, I firmly grasped it and elevated it to the level of the struggle between the two lines. Using the "two yardsticks" to measure and the "two mirrors" to reflect, I saw the things deep in my soul. Chairman Mao said: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." How to treat this cadre is not just about one person; it is about the attitude towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Fear of not being able to stand firm, not daring to uphold Chairman Mao's cadre policy, and not daring to release cadres according to Chairman Mao's teachings, this is the biggest selfishness, this is disloyalty to Chairman Mao. To be loyal to Chairman Mao, one must replace "fear" with "dare," replace "selfishness" with "public spirit," and replace "believing in oneself" with "believing in the masses." Stand firmly on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

By elevating the issue to the level of the struggle between the two lines and recognizing the attitude towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, one gains the courage to boldly mobilize the masses to release cadres. Among the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, we organized the study of "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," the "Three Articles," and Chairman Mao's cadre policy. We guided everyone to compare with Chairman Mao's teachings, present facts, explain reasons, distinguish between the two types of contradictions, and correctly handle the merits and demerits, the main and secondary aspects of cadres using class analysis and the one-divides-into-two viewpoint. At the same time, we criticized the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large number and protecting a small number," and fiercely fought against the "selfishness" in our minds. Mao Zedong Thought unified everyone's understanding, eliminated the antagonistic sentiments between the two factions, and united them more closely. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, with the attitude of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient," criticized the cadre's mistakes. The cadre also sincerely checked himself. Later, the masses agreed to let him participate in the production leadership team.

The "two yardsticks" and "two mirrors" must be used to measure and reflect in the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution made me realize: Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions are our action guidelines for class struggle. We use the "two yardsticks" and "two mirrors" to measure and reflect thousands of times, but the most fundamental thing is to measure and reflect in the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, continuously measuring the depth of loyalty to Chairman Mao and continuously reflecting the purity of loyalty to Chairman Mao.

Last year, I went to the Yán Tái Power Plant to support leftist activities. This plant had two revolutionary mass organizations, one with more people and the other with fewer. The one with more people wanted to absorb the one with fewer, and the one with fewer wanted to expand its influence, and they could not unite. After Chairman Mao's latest instructions on achieving great unity were transmitted, everyone was anxious, and so was I. How to make Chairman Mao's latest instructions penetrate into everyone's heart? I used the "two mirrors" to repeatedly reflect on my thoughts and realized: No matter how enthusiastic, the most enthusiastic thing is to arm the revolutionary masses with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. No matter how responsible, the most responsible thing is to turn Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line into the actions of the masses. Definitely do painstaking and detailed ideological work to make the two revolutionary mass organizations truly achieve great unity on the principle of Mao Zedong Thought.

There was a worker who was a leader of a mass organization, deceived, and stood on the wrong side. His thoughts were difficult to change. However, after his work was done well, he had a significant influence in the factory. I talked to him four times in a row, and he had some understanding of his problems. But after two days, he changed his mind again. By the eighth time, he said: "This time it's done, my thoughts are really clear, I'll go back and join our class's rebellion team." I saw his determination was great, so I was relieved. The next morning, I went to congratulate him. Unexpectedly, he changed his mind again! At this time, I felt a bit impatient and irritable, thinking, how can this person be so fickle, never ending. This time, the heart-to-heart talk also did not go well.

That night, I opened the "Three Articles" and used the "two yardsticks" and "two mirrors" to reflect, feeling that I was wrong. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Be extremely responsible to work and extremely enthusiastic to comrades." He also teaches us: "The work of ideological transformation is long-term, patient, and detailed work." "To make others serve, one can only persuade, not coerce." I felt impatient with this worker's repeated thoughts, isn't this trying to coerce him? Why is this? Thinking and thinking, the problem lies in not letting him educate himself with Mao Zedong Thought and liberate himself, but wanting to replace his thoughts with my own. This is not only a problem of dealing with him but also a problem of attitude towards Chairman Mao's latest instructions and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. I thought: The fundamental purpose of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform people's souls. Therefore, the problem is not whether the masses join the revolutionary rebellion team earlier or later, but whether the broad masses truly grasp Mao Zedong Thought. If this comrade only formally joins the revolutionary mass organization, without planting the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought deep in his soul, without truly standing on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, he still cannot become a genuine revolutionary who carries the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Our responsibility is to patiently propagate Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions to the masses. We are not afraid of some comrades' thoughts being fickle. Each time they are fickle, Mao Zedong Thought should take root and deepen in their minds, helping them raise their awareness of the struggle between the two lines. Thus, helping a comrade stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line can truly increase the force to continue the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Thinking this way, I made up my mind: Even if he is fickle eight or nine times, even if he is fickle a hundred times, I will use Chairman Mao's latest instructions to enlighten his heart. The next day, I talked to this worker, checked my impatient mood, and asked him to help me be a good propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought; at the same time, more patiently helped him raise his awareness of the struggle between the two lines. Later, I even moved my bedding to this worker's dormitory, studied the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions with him, talked about the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and fought against selfishness and revised our thoughts. After repeated study and repeated fighting against selfishness, Mao Zedong Thought enlightened our hearts, and this comrade finally returned to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we often encounter a flash of selfishness and a moment of hesitation in action. The more these times, the more we need to use the "two yardsticks" and "two mirrors" to guard against it, and there must be no half-heartedness.

One night, I carried a quotation board to the workshop to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions. When I turned to the coal transportation team, it was already past midnight. Here, I worked and propagated while working, and all the workers were propagated to. I suddenly remembered that there was still a comrade on the fourth floor roof, so I said goodbye to the workers and climbed up the stairs. A worker pulled me and said: "Old Sun, we can't let you go anymore. You haven't had a good sleep for several days and nights. If you don't go to rest, we will rebel against you! We will go to propagate to the person upstairs." At this time, I really felt tired and sleepy. A thought flashed in my mind: There is only one person on the fourth floor roof, anyway, someone will go to propagate, so don't go. Just at this moment, Chairman Mao's teaching of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people suddenly connected with this flash of selfishness. I thought: Chairman Mao's latest instructions are battle commands and action guidelines. How can I, for a little less fatigue, not deliver direction and strength to my class brothers? The more difficult the times, the more it tests whether one can "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people, whether one can be "extremely responsible" to work and "extremely enthusiastic" to comrades. Thinking this way, I had the strength to climb up the four floors and timely propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions to that worker.

From this, I deeply felt: Strictly following Chairman Mao's teachings, when selfishness flashes, give it a fierce blow. Only in this way can Chairman Mao's latest instructions truly take root in the mind and be well implemented in action.

The "two yardsticks" and "two mirrors" must be used to measure and reflect among the masses.

Using the "two yardsticks" and "two mirrors" to measure and reflect among the masses, rooting oneself among the masses, and learning from the masses at all times, is the best furnace for tempering loyalty to Chairman Mao.

The Mao Zedong Thought study class of the coal transportation team of the power plant is held during the work break from two to four in the morning. One day, I went to participate in their study, and they said I had not slept enough these days and forcibly pulled me back to the dormitory. A worker forced me to take off my clothes and lie on the bed, turned off the light, and said to me: "Everyone sent me to stand guard and watch you sleep!" The concern of the worker comrades made me very moved.

Lying on the bed, under the dim light of the street lamp, looking at the portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall, the thoughts and work of the day flashed by like a movie, one scene after another, under the examination of the "two yardsticks" and "two mirrors." However, when it came to the scene of not participating in the study class of the coal transportation team, it could not pass. I felt that not participating in their study was not doing "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people and being "extremely responsible" to work. The worker comrades, despite their fatigue, studied Chairman Mao's works deeply into the night, which was their expression of infinite love for Chairman Mao and infinite loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought. This was also my learning opportunity, how could I not participate? Thinking this way, I could not lie still and persuaded the worker watching me sleep to return to the coal transportation team to participate in their study. I and the worker comrades studied the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions with questions, and shared our study experiences. An old worker excitedly said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated by Chairman Mao made us poor people no longer suffer twice. Remembering the old society, I worked for the landlord, exerted the strength of cattle and horses, ate the food of pigs and dogs, and worked to the point of death. My parents could only watch me suffer in the fire pit. It was Chairman Mao who saved me. I feel from the bottom of my heart that Chairman Mao is more dear than my parents. But the scoundrel Liu Shaoqi, opposing our great leader Chairman Mao, wants to make us slaves again. He is dreaming during the day, and he will never succeed in his lifetime. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we will fight to the death with him. Whoever loves Chairman Mao, we will be close to him. The more we talked, the more we loved Chairman Mao. At the end of the study, this old worker patted the dust off his body and straightened his hat, saluted the portrait of Chairman Mao, and said: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Rest assured, we will always follow you. The words and actions of the worker comrades made me see the sublime qualities of the workers' infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao, and also saw my own shortcomings. From then on, I often asked old workers to tell me about the bitterness of the old society, the sweetness of the new society, the love for Chairman Mao, the hatred for Liu Shaoqi, and fought against selfishness and revised our thoughts with the worker comrades. I further felt: The masses are my examples of loyalty to Chairman Mao and the soil for cultivating my class feelings of infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao. Never leaving the masses is the fundamental way for me to be always loyal to Chairman Mao.

After more than a year of practice in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I deeply feel: I have not studied Chairman Mao's great theory on continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship enough; how to elevate the transformation of my thoughts to the level of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, using Mao Zedong Thought to break big selfishness and establish big public spirit, my experience is still not much. In this regard, one can say that I have just taken the first step and need to continue to strive.

　　把破私立公提到两条路线斗争的高度
　　济南部队第三次活学活用毛泽东思想代表大会代表、某部后勤处长　孙乐义
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我体会到，要使自己紧紧跟上伟大领袖毛主席，做一个真正的无产阶级革命战士，把社会主义革命进行到底，就要始终不渝地用“完全”“彻底”为人民服务这“两把尺子”，用“对工作的极端的负责任”和“对同志对人民的极端的热忱”这“两面镜子”，为忠于毛主席去量，为忠于毛主席去照。让“忠”字浸透灵魂，统帅生命，指挥行动。
    “两把尺子”“两面镜子”要在贯彻毛主席革命路线中去量去照
    前几年，通过反复学习“老三篇”，我找到了“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的“两把尺子”，“对工作的极端的负责任”“对同志对人民的极端的热忱”的“两面镜子”，经常量行动，照思想，对改造思想和做好工作起了很大作用。可是，无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，我对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线有些不理解，对毛主席的伟大战略部署往往不能紧紧跟上。有一天，从外地来了几十个同志，要我谈谈学习毛主席著作的体会，特别提出要我谈谈在无产阶级文化大革命中，我是怎样活学活用毛主席著作、继续进行革命的，我在运用“两把尺子”“两面镜子”上有什么新的体会。这个问题一下子把我难住了。几十个人一个劲鼓掌，鼓得我心里直发慌。正在为难的时候，坐在一旁的一位首长说让我准备准备，我这才顺着梯子下了楼。
    这件事使我震动很大。回来以后，饭也吃不好，觉也睡不着。我反来复去地想：为什么自己过去没有考虑这个问题呢？在无产阶级文化大革命中，我究竟应该怎样用“两把尺子”、“两面镜子”继续革命？在新的形势下，怎样才能无限忠于毛主席，紧紧跟上毛主席？
    带着这个问题，我反复学习了毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策。我认识到：毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，提出了在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的极为重大的问题，解决的是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的矛盾，这是关系到国家命运、人类前途的大事。在这样一场伟大的革命斗争中，能不能坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，这是检验一个革命战士是不是忠于毛主席的根本问题。过去我总觉得：用“两把尺子”、“两面镜子”的精神去烧火，火就烧得旺，煤就烧得省；用它去对待同志，就能极端热忱，亲如兄弟；用它去改造思想，狠斗“私”字，就有成效。这样下去，紧跟毛主席是没有问题了。然而，看一看自己在学习毛主席著作、改造世界观方面走过的道路，我深深感到：在社会主义革命深入发展的今天，一个革命战士的思想改造，仅仅局限于在一般工作中破私立公，显然是不够的；一般的工作和思想问题固然要解决，但是，对一个革命战士来说，最重要的还是关心国家大事，关心阶级斗争、两条路线斗争的大事，把“两把尺子”、“两面镜子”要在贯彻毛主席革命路线中去量去照。只有自觉地把改造思想和做好工作提到两条路线斗争的高度，提到忠于毛主席的高度，才能算是真正做到了“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务。
    去年我在尹格庄支左的时候，村上的群众对一个干部的看法有了分歧。一部分人要打倒他，说这个干部不倒，尹格庄好不了；一部分人坚决保他，说这个干部一倒，敌人叫好。两派群众对立得很厉害。怎么办？我就遵照毛主席的教导，首先到群众中去进行调查研究。经过调查，我们了解到这个干部是一个积极组织社员学习毛主席著作，关心集体事业，敢于坚持原则，对坏人坏事敢于揭发、斗争的好干部。只是由于工作方法简单粗暴，犯了一些错误。阶级敌人煽动一些群众，想趁机把他打倒。我们认为这个干部虽然有比较严重的错误，但不是走资派，应该说服群众，帮助这个干部站出来革命。
    有人知道我们想叫这个干部站出来，就传出风来说：“××是我们群众揪出来的走资派，不管是谁，想替××翻案，就是和党内走资派站在一起，决没有好下场！”听了这些话，我心里想：让这个干部站出来革命是对的，可是这个干部有严重错误，有这么多人反对他，搞不好，我在尹格庄就可能站不住脚。这个思想一露头，我就狠狠抓住它，把它提到两条路线斗争的高度上来，用“两把尺子”量，用“两面镜子”照，一量一照，就看到了自己灵魂深处的东西。毛主席说：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”怎样对待这个干部，这不是对一个人的问题，而是对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的态度问题。怕自己站不住脚，而不敢坚持毛主席的干部政策，不敢按照毛主席的教导去解放干部，这就是最大的“私”，就是对毛主席不忠。要忠于毛主席，就要把“怕”字换成“敢”字，把“私”字换成“公”字，把“相信自己”换成“相信群众”。把脚跟牢牢地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上。
    把问题提到两条路线斗争的高度，提到对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的态度上来认识，就有了敢于放手发动群众解放干部的勇气。我们在广大贫下中农中，组织学习《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，学习“老三篇”以及毛主席的干部政策，引导大家对照毛主席的教导，摆事实，讲道理，分清两类不同性质的矛盾，用阶级分析和一分为二的观点，正确对待干部的成绩和缺点，主流和支流。同时批判了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字。毛泽东思想把大家的认识统一了，两派消除了对立情绪，更加紧密地团结起来了。广大贫下中农，抱着“惩前毖后，治病救人”的态度，对那个干部的错误进行了批判。那个干部也诚心诚意地作了检查。后来，群众同意他参加生产领导班子。
    “两把尺子”“两面镜子”要在落实毛主席最新指示中去量去照
    无产阶级文化大革命的实践使我认识到：毛主席的一系列最新指示，就是我们进行阶级斗争的行动纲领。我们用“两把尺子”“两面镜子”千量万照，最根本的就是要在落实毛主席最新指示中去量去照，不断地去量忠于毛主席的深度，不断地去照忠于毛主席的纯度。
    去年我到烟台发电厂支左。这个厂有两个革命群众组织，一个人数多些，一个人数少些；人数多的想吃掉人数少的，人数少的想扩大势力，一直联合不起来。毛主席关于实现革命大联合的最新指示传达下来以后，大家着急，我也着急。怎样使毛主席的最新指示落实到每个人心坎里呢？我用“两面镜子”反复对照自己的思想，认识到：千热忱，万热忱，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装革命群众的头脑，才是极端的热忱。千负责，万负责，把毛主席的无产阶级革命路线化为群众的行动，才是极端的负责。一定要作艰苦细致的思想工作，使两个革命群众组织真正在毛泽东思想原则基础上实现革命大联合。
    有一个工人，是个群众组织的头头，受蒙蔽站错了队，思想弯子难转。但是，作好了他的工作，在厂里影响较大。我连续找他谈了四次话，他对自己的问题有了认识，可是过了两天，他又变了卦。谈到第八次，他说：“这下子行了，我思想真通了，我回去就参加俺班的造反队。”我看他决心挺大，也就放心了。第二天一早，我去给他贺喜。没想到，他又变卦了！这时我有些急躁和不耐烦，心想，你这个人怎么这样反来复去，没有个完。这次谈心，也谈得不太好。
    晚上回来，我打开“老三篇”，用“两把尺子”、“两面镜子”一对照，觉得自己做得不对。毛主席教导我们：对工作要极端负责任，对同志要极端热忱。还教导我们：“思想改造的工作是长期的、耐心的、细致的工作”。“要人家服，只能说服，不能压服。”我对这个工人思想上的反复产生急躁情绪，这岂不是想压服他吗？为什么会这样呢？想来想去，问题就出在不是让他用毛泽东思想自己教育自己，自己解放自己，而是想以自己的想法代替他的想法。这就不仅是对待他一个人的问题，而是对毛主席最新指示的态度问题，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的态度问题。我想：无产阶级文化大革命的根本目的是要用毛泽东思想改造人们的灵魂。因此，问题不在于群众早一天还是晚一天参加革命造反派队伍，而是要看广大群众是不是真正掌握了毛泽东思想。如果这个同志只是形式上参加了革命群众组织，灵魂深处没有插上毛泽东思想伟大红旗，没有真正站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，还是不能成为把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的真正革命派。我们的责任，就是要耐心地向群众宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，宣传毛主席一系列最新指示。我们不怕一些同志思想有反复。反复一次就要让毛泽东思想在他们的头脑里扎根扎深一分，就要帮助他们把路线斗争的觉悟提高一步。这样，帮助一个同志站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，就可以真正增加一分在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的力量。这样一想，我就下定决心，别说他反复八、九次，就是反复一百次，我也要用毛主席的最新指示把他的心照亮。第二天，我就找这个工人谈话，检查了自己的急躁情绪，要他帮助我当好毛泽东思想宣传员；同时，更耐心地帮助他提高路线斗争觉悟。后来，我干脆把铺盖搬到这个工人的宿舍里，同他一起学习“老三篇”和毛主席的最新指示，一起谈无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，一起斗私批修。经过反复学习，反复斗私，毛泽东思想照亮了我们的心，这个同志终于回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来了。
    在落实毛主席的最新指示中，经常碰到“私”字的一闪念，行动上一刹那的犹豫。越是这些时候，越需要用“两把尺子”、“两面镜子”把关，决不能有半点含糊。
    一天晚上，我背着语录牌到车间里宣传毛主席的最新指示。转到运煤组的时候，已经十二点多了。在这里我边劳动边宣传，所有的工人都宣传到了。我忽然想起，四层楼顶上还有一个同志，就和工人打了个招呼往楼上爬。有个工人同志一把拉住我说：“老孙，我们再也不能让你去了，你已经几天几夜没睡好觉了，再不去休息，我们就要造你的反啦！楼上那个同志我们去宣传。”这时，我也确实感到身发累，眼发困。脑子里闪出一个念头：四层楼顶上只有一个人，横竖有人去宣传，不去算了吧！就在这个时候，毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导，忽地和这一闪念的“私”字接上了火。我想：毛主席的最新指示，就是战斗的命令，行动的指针。我怎么能为自己少受点累，就不给阶级兄弟送方向、送力量呢？越是困难的时候，越是检验自己能不能“完全”“彻底”为人民服务，能不能对工作“极端的负责任”，对同志“极端的热忱”的时候。这样一想，浑身就有了力量。我到底还是爬上了四层楼，向那个工人及时地宣传了毛主席的最新指示。
    从这里，我深深体会到：严格按照毛主席的教导，在“私”字一闪念的时候，就给它个迎头痛击。只有这样，毛主席的最新指示才能真正在头脑里扎根，才能很好地在行动上落实。
    “两把尺子”“两面镜子”要在群众中量，在群众中照
    用“两把尺子”“两面镜子”在群众当中量，在群众当中照，把自己扎根于群众之中，处处向群众学习，是锻炼对毛主席“忠”字的最好熔炉。
    发电厂运煤组的毛泽东思想学习班，是在夜间两点到四点的工作间隙学习。一天，我去参加他们的学习，他们说我这几天睡觉太少，硬把我拉回宿舍。一个工人逼着我脱下衣服躺在床上，他关了灯，对我说：“大家派我来站岗看着你睡！”工人同志的关怀，使我十分感动。
    我躺在床上，借着外面的路灯，看着墙上毛主席的像，一天的思想和工作象放电影一样，在“两把尺子”“两面镜子”的检验下，一幕一幕地过去了，可是放到不参加运煤组学习班这一幕时，就过不去了，觉得不去参加他们的学习，就没有做到“完全”“彻底”为人民服务和“对工作的极端的负责任”。工人同志们不怕疲劳，深更半夜学习毛主席著作，这是他们无限热爱毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想的表现，也是我学习的好机会，我怎么能不参加呢？想到这里，我怎么也躺不住了，便说服了看着我睡觉的工人，回到运煤组参加了他们的学习。我和工人同志们一起带着问题学习“老三篇”和毛主席的最新指示，互相谈了自己的学习体会。一个老工人激动地说：毛主席亲自发动的这场无产阶级文化大革命，使咱穷人再不会受二遍苦。回想起旧社会，我给地主扛活，出的牛马力，吃的猪狗食，累得死去活来，我爹妈只有眼睁睁地看着我在火坑里受罪。是毛主席把我救出来了，我打心眼里感到毛主席比爹妈亲。可是中国赫鲁晓夫这个坏蛋，反对咱们伟大领袖毛主席，妄想再叫咱们当牛做马。他这是白日做梦，一辈子也办不到。谁反对毛主席，我们就和他拚，谁热爱毛主席，我们就和他亲。大家越谈越热爱毛主席。在学习结束时，这个老工人把身上的土拍了又拍，把帽子整了又整，边向毛主席像敬礼边说：毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家放心吧，我们永远跟着您。工人同志的言论行动，使我看到了工人同志无限忠于毛主席的崇高品质，也看到了自己的差距。从这以后，我就经常请老工人给我讲旧社会的苦，讲新社会的甜，讲对毛主席的热爱，讲对中国赫鲁晓夫的仇恨，和工人同志一起斗私批修。我进一步体会到：群众是自己忠于毛主席的榜样，也是培养自己无限忠于毛主席的阶级感情的土壤。一刻也不脱离群众，是自己永远忠于毛主席的根本途径。
    经过一年多无产阶级文化大革命的实践，我深深感到：毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的伟大理论，自己还学习得很不够；如何把自己的思想改造提到阶级斗争、两条路线斗争的高度，用毛泽东思想破大私，立大公，自己的体会也还不多。在这方面，可以说是刚刚跨出了第一步，还需要继续努力。（附图片）
