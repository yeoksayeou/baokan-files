	New China News Agency, May 23rd: The Indonesian Communist Party unites firmly under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, leading the Indonesian people to continue advancing on the path of people's war!

	— Statement by the Indonesian Communist Party Central Committee Delegation on the 48th Anniversary of the Founding of the Indonesian Communist Party

	May 23, 1968, is the 48th anniversary of the founding of our beloved and respected party, the Indonesian Communist Party. Indonesian communists and revolutionary people commemorate the party's birthday through their brave struggle against the fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution, by taking up arms in the countryside, mountains, and forests, and by defying the brutal torture and persecution of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime in prisons and concentration camps with an unshakable and steadfast spirit. No matter how savage the reactionaries are, they cannot stop the Indonesian Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people from commemorating the birthday of their party. They commemorate the party's birthday by further tempering their fighting spirit in the course of waging guerrilla warfare, establishing rural revolutionary bases, mobilizing the peasant masses to carry out a land revolution, persisting in protracted armed struggle, encircling the cities from the countryside, and ultimately seizing the cities and achieving national liberation.

	On the occasion of commemorating the 48th anniversary of the founding of the Indonesian Communist Party, we fully recognize that the long-term struggle ahead of us is fraught with difficulties and sacrifices. The rampant white terror since October 1965 and the opportunist and revisionist errors in the party's line from 1951 to 1965 have dealt a heavy blow to the Indonesian people's revolutionary movement and resulted in the sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of Indonesian communists and revolutionary people. With the support of U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime further strengthens its oppression and exploitation of the Indonesian people. They have restored and strengthened imperialist control over the Indonesian economy, completely betraying the national interests of the Indonesian people. Out of fear of the revolutionary influence of the great People's Republic of China, they have carried out unprecedented barbaric anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese racist movements. Although the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian revolutionary people are currently facing tremendous difficulties, with the enemy temporarily strong and revolutionary forces still weak, we look to the future with a spirit full of revolutionary optimism. In the statement issued by the Indonesian Communist Party Central Political Bureau on May 23, 1967, commemorating the 47th anniversary of the founding of the Indonesian Communist Party, it was said: "The victory of the Indonesian counter-revolutionary forces and their superiority over the revolutionary forces is not because the Indonesian counter-revolutionary forces are in a state of upward development. The occurrence of this event is due to the fact that the revolutionary forces led by the Indonesian Communist Party have suffered a great weakening—this is the result of the opportunist and revisionist errors of our party; this error has allowed the counter-revolutionary forces to deal a heavy blow to the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian revolutionary movement. The victory of the Indonesian counter-revolutionary forces and their superiority over the revolutionary forces is temporary. This is happening at a time when counter-revolutionary forces around the world are heading towards comprehensive collapse. The backers of the Indonesian counter-revolutionary forces are rotten. Domestically, the Indonesian counter-revolutionary forces rely on a rotten social system, i.e., feudal remnants that are completely opposed to the broad masses of the Indonesian people. Externally, the Indonesian counter-revolutionary forces rely on U.S. imperialism and receive the support of the Soviet revisionist leadership. This external backer is also not a solid backer, but a rotten backer." The developments since this period show that the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime is facing insurmountable and increasing difficulties. Although they receive "aid" from imperialists and modern revisionists, they will not be able to overcome various difficulties in the economy and finance. The contradictions within the ruling clique over power struggles are becoming increasingly sharp. Most importantly, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, the Indonesian people have risen up to take up arms against the counter-revolutionary rule.

	Comrade Mao Zedong teaches us: "If you want a revolution, you must have a revolutionary party. Without a revolutionary party, without a party built on the revolutionary theory and revolutionary style of Marxism-Leninism, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs." Under very difficult conditions, after a relatively short period, the Indonesian Communist Party issued the "Self-Criticism of the Indonesian Communist Party Central Political Bureau" in September 1966, correcting the fundamental errors in the party's line in the past. The various lessons learned from the bloody experiences of the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian revolutionary movement are not only of great significance to the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian revolution but also an important lesson for the struggles of revolutionary people around the world and the international communist movement. This experience and lesson clearly and profoundly prove that once Mao Zedong Thought is violated, the revolution will inevitably suffer losses; the revisionist road of "peaceful transition" advocated by the modern revisionists centered on the Soviet leadership is the road to the destruction of the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries.

	The "Self-Criticism of the Indonesian Communist Party Central Political Bureau" clearly emphasizes: "The Indonesian revolution must achieve complete victory and must follow the path of the Chinese revolution. This means that the Indonesian revolution inevitably must adopt armed people's struggle against armed counter-revolution as the main form of struggle, which in essence is the armed peasant land revolution led by the proletariat." The Indonesian Communist Party has formulated three banners in accordance with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, which are of great significance in leading the Indonesian revolution. By resolutely carrying out the tasks in the three banners, we will have the three main weapons to win the victory of the Indonesian people's democratic revolution: First, the Marxist-Leninist party as the core of the revolution; second, the people's armed forces led by the Indonesian Communist Party as the main organizational form of the revolution; third, the revolutionary united front led by the Indonesian Communist Party as the embodiment of all revolutionary forces in Indonesia.

	The Indonesian Marxist-Leninists, based on their own experience, regard Mao Zedong Thought as the only guiding ideology for the Indonesian Communist Party to rebuild itself into a Marxist-Leninist party capable of leading the Indonesian revolution. The Indonesian Communist Party Central Political Bureau emphasized in its statement on May 23, 1967: "The Indonesian Marxist-Leninists unreservedly accept Mao Zedong Thought as the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, are determined to learn it, and use it as a powerful weapon in the Indonesian liberation struggle; the path of the Indonesian liberation struggle inevitably must follow the path of people's war pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong."

	Currently, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, the Indonesian people have begun to take the path of armed struggle. Armed struggle has ignited in the main islands of Kalimantan (especially West Kalimantan), Java (especially East Java), Sumatra, and Sulawesi. The people are beginning to organize their own armed forces and punish evil landlords and local tyrants. By overcoming various difficulties, the Indonesian Communist Party has begun to shift the focus of its work from the cities to the countryside, from peaceful struggle to armed struggle, from legal to illegal, and from open to secret. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, according to the current principles of party building, that is, to serve armed struggle, to focus on the countryside and engage in underground work, the Indonesian Marxist-Leninists are rebuilding the Indonesian Communist Party.

	In the process of rebuilding the Indonesian Communist Party into a Marxist-Leninist party capable of leading the Indonesian revolution, we must continue to thoroughly purge the remnants of opportunism and revisionist errors, eliminate their ideological roots and conditions for growth, purge individualist thoughts, and foster the spirit of being willing to sacrifice for the people and the party. For this purpose, as the Political Bureau pointed out clearly on the 47th anniversary of the founding of the Indonesian Communist Party: "We must study, master, and apply Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought more seriously."

	We commemorate the 48th anniversary of the founding of the Indonesian Communist Party under extremely favorable international conditions for the Indonesian revolution and the world revolution. The complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has great international significance. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made China a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, hundreds of millions of Chinese people have learned, mastered, and applied Mao Zedong Thought as the most powerful ideological weapon against all revolutionary enemies. The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution ensures that China, as the strongest bastion of world revolution, will forever be red. The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution achieved by the Chinese people under the direct leadership of the great Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party is a heavy blow to the imperialists led by U.S. imperialism, the modern revisionists centered on the Soviet leadership, and the reactionaries of various countries—including the traitorous regime of Suharto-Nasution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, making Mao Zedong Thought the banner of victory for the struggles of revolutionary people around the world.

	Under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Marxist-Leninist Party of Labor of Albania, the People's Republic of Albania has become a stronghold against imperialism and modern revisionism and a beacon of socialism in Europe.

	The struggles of the peoples of various countries against imperialism led by U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership, and the reactionaries of various countries are surging. The Vietnamese people have achieved one victory after another in their heroic struggle to smash U.S. imperialist aggression, defend North Vietnam, liberate South Vietnam, and reunify the country. The achievements and victories of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries are direct aid to the struggle of the Indonesian people to smash the fascist military dictatorship of Suharto-Nasution.

	On the occasion of commemorating the 48th anniversary of the founding of the Indonesian Communist Party, the Indonesian communists and revolutionary people express their gratitude and high respect to the Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of various countries for their international support for the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people.

	The Indonesian Communist Party, united firmly under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, will definitely lead the Indonesian people to continue advancing on the path of people's war, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory!

	Long live the armed struggle of the Indonesian revolutionary people!

	Down with the fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution!

	Long live the great Indonesian Communist Party!

	Long live proletarian internationalism!

	Long live Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!

	Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, and the beloved great leader of the revolutionary people of all countries!

    印尼共产党在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下巩固地团结起来，领导印尼人民继续前进，走人民战争的道路！

    新华社二十三日讯　印尼共产党在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下巩固地团结起来，领导印尼人民继续前进，走人民战争的道路！
    ——印尼共产党中央代表团纪念印尼共产党成立四十八周年的声明
    一九六八年五月二十三日是我们所尊敬和热爱的党——印尼共产党成立四十八周年的日子。印尼共产党人和印尼革命人民通过对苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权展开英勇的斗争，通过在农村、山区和森林里拿起武器，在监狱和集中营里藐视苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权的一切野蛮折磨和迫害而以毫不动摇的、坚定不移的精神坚持斗争来纪念党的生日。不管反动派多么野蛮残暴，也阻止不了印尼马克思列宁主义者和印尼革命人民纪念他们的党的生日。他们采取以下办法来纪念党的生日：在开展游击战争中进一步锻炼自己的斗志，建立农村革命根据地，发动农民群众进行土地革命，坚持持久的武装斗争，从农村包围城市，最后夺取城市和夺取全国解放。
    在纪念印尼共产党成立四十八周年的时候，我们完全认识到，摆在我们面前的长期的斗争道路是充满困难和牺牲的。始自一九六五年十月的猖獗的白色恐怖以及一九五一——一九六五年期间党在路线上所犯的机会主义—修正主义的错误，使印尼人民革命运动遭到沉重的打击，并造成了几十万印尼共产党人和印尼革命人民的牺牲。在美帝国主义者和苏联现代修正主义者的支持下，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权进一步加强其对印尼人民的压迫和剥削。他们恢复和加强了帝国主义对印尼经济的控制，完全出卖了印尼人民的民族利益。由于害怕伟大的中华人民共和国的革命影响，他们实行了史无前例的反华和排华种族主义的野蛮运动。虽然印尼共产党和印尼革命人民暂时面临着巨大的困难，敌人暂时还强大而革命力量仍弱小，但是，我们以充满革命乐观主义精神瞻望未来。在一九六七年五月二十三日纪念印尼共产党成立四十七周年的时候，印尼共产党中央政治局发表的声明中说：“印尼反革命力量的胜利和它对革命力量所占的优势，不是因为印尼反革命力量正处于向上发展之中。这件事情的发生是由于印尼共产党领导的革命力量遭到巨大的削弱——这是我们党的机会主义和修正主义错误的结果；这一错误使反革命力量有可能给印尼共产党和印尼革命运动予沉重的打击。印尼反革命力量的这个胜利，它对革命力量所占的优势，是暂时性的。这是在全世界反革命力量正在走向全面崩溃的形势下发生的。印尼反革命力量的靠山是腐朽的。在国内，印尼反革命力量依靠腐朽的社会制度，即同广大的印尼人民群众完全相对立的封建主义残余。对外，印尼反革命力量投靠美帝国主义并得到苏联修正主义领导集团的支持。这种国外的靠山也不是巩固的靠山，而是腐朽的靠山”。这个时期来的发展表明，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权面临着无法摆脱的、日益增多的困难。虽然得到帝国主义者和现代修正主义者的“援助”，但他们是不可能克服经济和财政方面的各种困难的。统治集团内部争权夺利的各种矛盾愈来愈尖锐。而最重要的是，在印尼共产党领导下，印尼人民已经奋起拿起武器反抗反革命统治。
    毛泽东同志教导我们：“既要革命，就要有一个革命党。没有一个革命的党，没有一个按照马克思列宁主义的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级和广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。”在很困难的条件下，经过较短的时间之后，印尼共产党在一九六六年九月发表了《印尼共产党中央政治局的自我批评》，纠正了过去党在路线上犯的根本错误。从印尼共产党和印尼人民革命运动的血的经验中吸取的各种教训，不但对印尼共产党和印尼革命具有重要意义，而且对全世界革命人民的斗争和国际共产主义运动也是一个重要的教训。这个经验教训极其清楚和深刻地证明，一旦违背毛泽东思想，革命就必定遭受损失；以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者所鼓吹的“和平过渡”的修正主义道路，是毁灭各国人民革命斗争的道路。
    《印尼共产党中央政治局的自我批评》明确地强调：“印尼革命要取得完全的胜利，也必须走中国革命的道路。这就是说，印尼革命不可避免地必须采取武装的人民斗争反对武装的反革命这一主要的斗争形式，其实质是无产阶级领导下的武装的农民土地革命。”印尼共产党已经制定了符合马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的三面旗帜，而且对领导印尼革命具有重大的作用。通过坚决执行三面旗帜中的各项任务，我们将会拥有赢得印尼人民民主革命胜利的三个主要武器：第一，作为革命领导核心的马克思列宁主义的政党；第二，作为革命的主要组织形式的印尼共产党领导下的人民武装力量；第三，作为印尼所有革命力量的体现的印尼共产党领导下的革命统一战线。
    印尼的马克思列宁主义者根据自己的经验，把毛泽东思想看成为印尼共产党把自己重新建设成为能够领导印尼革命的马克思列宁主义政党的唯一指导思想。印尼共产党中央政治局在一九六七年五月二十三日的声明中强调：“印尼的马克思列宁主义者毫不犹豫地接受毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，下定决心学习它，并在印尼解放斗争中作为强大的武器加以运用；印尼解放斗争的道路不可避免地必须走毛泽东同志所指出的人民战争的道路。”
    目前，在印尼共产党的领导下，印尼人民已经开始走上武装斗争的道路。武装斗争已经在加里曼丹（特别是西加里曼丹）、爪哇（特别是东爪哇）、苏门答腊和苏拉威西等主要岛屿燃烧起来。人民开始组织自己的武装力量，惩罚恶霸地主和土豪。通过克服种种困难，印尼共产党已经开始把工作重点从城市转入农村，从和平斗争转入武装斗争，从合法转入非法，从公开转入秘密。在毛泽东思想的指引下，根据目前党的建设的总原则，即为武装斗争服务，把工作重点放在农村和从事地下工作，印尼的马克思列宁主义者重新建设印尼共产党。
    在重建印尼共产党成为能够领导印尼革命的马克思列宁主义政党中，我们必须继续彻底肃清机会主义和修正主义错误的残余，铲除其思想根源和消除其滋长的条件，肃清个人主义思想和发扬勇于为人民和党的利益牺牲的精神。为此，正如政治局在印尼共产党成立四十七周年时所明确指出的那样：“我们必须更认真地学习、掌握和运用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。”
    我们在国际条件极其有利于印尼革命和世界革命的情况下纪念印尼共产党成立四十八周年。中国无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利具有巨大的国际意义。无产阶级文化大革命使中国成为毛泽东思想的大学校。通过无产阶级文化大革命，几亿中国人民学习、掌握和运用了作为反对所有革命敌人的最强大的思想武器——毛泽东思想。无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，保证成为最强大的世界革命堡垒的中国永远是红彤彤的。中国人民在伟大的毛泽东主席和中国共产党的直接领导下所取得的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义者，以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者和各国反动派——包括苏哈托—纳苏蒂安卖国政权的沉重打击。无产阶级文化大革命高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，使毛泽东思想成为全世界革命人民斗争的胜利旗帜。
    在恩维尔·霍查同志和马克思列宁主义的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国已成为反对帝国主义和反对现代修正主义的坚强堡垒和欧洲的一盏社会主义的明灯。
    世界各国人民反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争日益高涨。越南人民在粉碎美帝国主义的侵略，保卫越南北方，解放越南南方和统一祖国的英勇斗争中取得了一个又一个的胜利。世界各国人民的革命斗争所取得的成就和胜利，是对印尼人民粉碎苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人独裁政权的斗争的直接援助。
    在纪念印尼共产党成立四十八周年的时候，印尼共产党人和印尼革命人民对世界各国的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民给予印尼人民革命斗争的国际支持表示感谢和崇高的敬意。
    印尼共产党在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下巩固地团结起来，必定会领导印尼人民继续前进，走人民战争的道路，排除万难，去争取胜利！
    印尼革命人民的武装斗争万岁！
    打倒苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权！
    伟大的印尼共产党万岁！
    无产阶级国际主义万岁！
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！
    当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，世界各国革命人民最敬爱的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
                      一九六八年五月二十三日
