Sparks of Struggle

Occupation of the Odeon Theatre

Before midnight on May 15, the Odeon Theatre, one of the reactionary cultural bastions in France, was occupied by progressive French students. On that day, as the audience was leaving, thousands of demonstrating students, holding placards that read "The Odeon should serve the workers," rushed into the theatre. The police kept their distance and dared not approach. In less than a quarter of an hour, the main hall, the balconies, and the stage were all occupied by the students. The entire theatre echoed with cheers. People sang the "Internationale" to celebrate the victory. The students posted a sign at the ticket booth: "Under the current circumstances, bourgeois spectators are not allowed to enter the Odeon Theatre."

A bright red flag was raised on the roof of the occupied theatre. The excited students held an all-night meeting in the hall. The next morning, a committee formed by the students announced the closure of this bourgeois theatre, transforming it into a gathering place for the people, and opening it to the public free of charge.

The Fighting Sorbonne

The Sorbonne, located in the heart of the Latin Quarter on the Left Bank of the Seine, was occupied by progressive students. Red flags flew everywhere on the campus, and a vibrant fighting spirit filled the air.

In front of the main entrances of the Faculty of Letters and the Faculty of Science, large-character posters called "To the Students" were posted, urging students to continue the struggle. The placards bore bold letters: "Since 1848, this is the first time we have conducted a major cleanup here," "Down with school regulations," "No capitalist university," "The Sorbonne will always be open to workers."

Students posted rows of big-character posters on the walls of the teaching buildings. The content of the posters was rich: some quoted Chairman Mao's relevant sayings, while others detailed Xinhua News Agency's exposes of the French ruling class's suppression of students.

To expose the treacherous nature of the French revisionist group, some students even posted flyers with such content on the wall newspapers of the French revisionist organizations.

Going to the Workers

On May 17, about two to three thousand spirited students from the Sorbonne, carrying red flags, marched across Paris in a grand procession to the Renault car factory in Boulogne-Billancourt on the western outskirts of the city, where they joined the workers.

The students arrived at the Renault car factory, singing the "Internationale" and shouting slogans of "Workers and students unite!" They marched around the factory walls in a spirited demonstration.

Then, the students divided into small groups outside the factory and engaged in heated discussions with the workers about the current situation of the movement. The factory presented a scene of enthusiastic unity and struggle.

Opposing the Creation of "Idiots"

The wave of the French student movement quickly spread to "quiet" Sweden. Swedish young students also began to fight back.

In recent days, Swedish university students have held demonstrations and parades. Students in Stockholm held a meeting to oppose "Western ideological indoctrination" and oppose the university's creation of "computerized and specialized idiots."

A student angrily said, "We are being indoctrinated by the West. Ninety percent of the lecturers in political science and natural science received special scholarships to study in the United States."

Students protested against the "unscientific" teaching of the lecturers and strongly demanded reforms to the corrupt educational system.

"Research Belongs to the People"

On May 20, several hundred students at the Free University of Berlin occupied the building of the Southeast Asia Research Institute.

The students demanded the resignation of the director, Eckart. They solemnly pointed out that Eckart was an "old Nazi" and an "incompetent fool" who neglected his duties, insulted teachers and students, drank excessively, was anti-Semitic, and committed all sorts of evil deeds. For two years, Eckart's reactionary views on the situation in Southeast Asia had been repeatedly refuted by students and teachers.

The students who occupied the research institute raised a red flag on the roof and solemnly announced, "This research institute belongs to the people!"

They also wrote on the placards: "Eckart has been a Nazi since 1933!" The brave struggle of the students made the reactionary police stand by and not dare to interfere.

    斗争的火花
    占领奥代翁剧院
    五月十五日午夜之前，法国反动文化堡垒之一的奥代翁剧院，被法国进步学生占领。这天，正当观众散场时，数千示威学生拿着“奥代翁要为工人服务”的标语牌，冲进了这座剧院。警察躲得远远的，不敢上前一步。不到一刻钟，正厅、楼厢和舞台都被学生占领。整个剧场内一片欢呼声。人们高唱《国际歌》庆祝这个胜利。学生们在收票处贴出一张标语：“在目前的情况下，不允许资产阶级观众进入奥代翁剧院。”
    占领后的剧院的屋顶上升起了鲜艳的红旗。激动的学生们在大厅里通宵集会。第二天清晨，学生们组成的一个委员会宣布，关闭这个资产阶级的剧院，把剧院变成人民聚会的场所，向群众免费开放。
    战斗的巴黎大学
    位于塞纳河左岸学府大街中心区的巴黎大学，在被进步学生占领后，校园里到处飘扬着红旗，洋溢着蓬勃的战斗气氛。
    在文学院和理学院正门前广场上，张贴着大字书写的《告学生》呼吁书，号召学生继续战斗。标语牌上写着醒目的大字：“从一八四八年以来，这次是我们第一次在这里进行大清扫”，“打倒校规”，“不要资本主义的大学”，“巴黎大学永远向工人开放”。
    学生们在教学大楼的墙上贴着一排排的大字报。大字报的内容十分丰富：有的摘录了毛主席的有关语录，有的详细地抄录了新华社揭露法国统治集团镇压学生的消息。
    学生们为了揭露法修集团的叛徒面目，有的学生还把这种内容的传单贴到法修组织的墙报上去。
    走到工人中间去
    两三千名斗志昂扬的巴黎大学学生，五月十七日，高举着红旗，浩浩荡荡，横穿巴黎，到达巴黎西郊的布洛涅—比扬古，同那里的雷诺汽车厂的工人汇合起来。
    学生们来到雷诺汽车厂，高唱《国际歌》，高呼“工人和学生团结起来”的口号，慷慨激昂，绕着工厂的围墙示威游行。
    然后，学生们在工厂外面，分成许多小组，同工人们一起，热烈讨论当前运动的形势。工厂显现了一派热气腾腾的团结战斗的景象。
    反对制造“白痴”
    法国学生运动的浪潮，迅速地波及“沉寂”的瑞典。瑞典青年学生也开始起来斗争了。
    连日来，瑞典大学生举行示威游行。斯德哥尔摩的大学生举行集会，反对“西方的思想灌输”，反对大学“制造计算机化和专门化的白痴”。
    一位学生愤怒地说：“我们在受西方的思想灌输。政治科学和自然科学的讲授者中，百分之九十都是领受特别助学金在美国受的教育。”
    学生们抗议讲授者的“不科学的”教学，强烈要求改革腐朽的教育制度。
    “研究所属于人民”
    西柏林自由大学的几百名学生，于五月二十日占领了这个大学的东南亚研究所的大楼。
    学生们要求所长埃卡特辞职。他们严正指出，埃卡特是个“老纳粹分子”，而且是个“拙劣无能”的家伙，时平玩忽职守，辱骂师生，酗酒，排犹，无恶不作。两年来，埃卡特对东南亚局势的反动观点，一再遭到学生和教师们的驳斥。
    占领这个研究所的学生们在屋顶上升起一面红旗，庄严宣布：“本研究所属于人民！”
    他们并且在标语牌上写着：“埃卡特从一九三三年就是一个纳粹分子！”学生们的英勇斗争使反动警察呆在附近，不敢干涉。
