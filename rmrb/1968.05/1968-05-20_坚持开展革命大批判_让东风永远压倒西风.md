In the midst of a great situation both domestically and internationally, the hundred million military personnel and civilians across the nation are filled with high fighting spirit, solemnly commemorating the second anniversary of the issuance of the important "Notice" personally drafted by our great leader Chairman Mao. At this moment, the important article "A Document of Epoch-Making Significance" has brought us the voice of our great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, giving us great encouragement and strengthening our fighting will. We sincerely wish our dearest red sun, our great teacher Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!

Over the past two years, the mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has carried out extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism against a handful of class enemies. Chairman Mao said, "They are a bunch of anti-communist, anti-people counter-revolutionaries. Their struggle with us is a life-and-death struggle, and there is no question of equality. Therefore, our struggle with them can only be a life-and-death struggle. Our relationship with them is absolutely not one of equality, but one of a class oppressing another class, that is, the dictatorship or rule of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, and not some other relationship, such as the so-called equal relationship, the peaceful coexistence of the exploited class with the exploiting class, moral relationships, etc."

As pointed out in "A Document of Epoch-Making Significance": "In the political and ideological sphere, it is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind, either the proletariat prevailing over the bourgeoisie, or the bourgeoisie prevailing over the proletariat. There is no middle way to take." Whether or not to carry out revolutionary criticism, whether or not to insist on letting the East Wind prevail over the West Wind, letting the proletariat prevail over the bourgeoisie, is a major issue of whether one is loyal or disloyal to our great leader Chairman Mao, loyal or disloyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, loyal or disloyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. If we relax revolutionary criticism, the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism cannot be eliminated, and one day the West Wind will prevail over the East Wind, and the bourgeoisie will prevail over the proletariat. Only by carrying out deep and sustained revolutionary criticism, eliminating the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism from all aspects, and uprooting the roots of revisionism, can the East Wind always prevail over the West Wind, and the proletariat always prevail over the bourgeoisie, thus ensuring that our socialist red land will never change color.

In the great storm of the "January Revolution," the revolutionary masses of our factory, hoisting high the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," seized back the party, government, financial, and cultural powers usurped by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, achieving a decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Because of the victory, some comrades have relaxed their revolutionary vigilance, thinking that the capitalist roaders within the party are "dead tigers" and that "a few loaches cannot cause big waves," and so on. However, "the tree wants to be still, but the wind does not stop," the law of class struggle is not subject to human will. The overthrown capitalist roaders within the party and various class enemies do not resign themselves to death. They have adopted more cunning and covert means to deal with us. Sometimes they pretend to be dead, sometimes they show their ferocity, playing the two-faced trick of counter-revolutionaries. They collude with the rightist reversal wind in society to launch a fierce counterattack. A die-hard capitalist roader even colluded with a handful of counter-revolutionaries to attempt to harm the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations in the revolutionary committee and carry out a counter-revolutionary coup.

This series of shocking class struggle facts have educated all the revolutionary workers in the factory, making everyone clearly realize that our struggle with the class enemies is a life-and-death struggle. If you do not fight them, they will fight you. If you do not eat them, they will eat you. As said in "A Document of Epoch-Making Significance": "In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionaries must firmly struggle against and criticize the bourgeois reactionaries, the poisonous weeds, and the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed. The proletariat must prevail over the bourgeoisie and must not talk about 'equality' with them."

Over the past year, under the guidance of the PLA propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought stationed in the factory, we have followed the series of latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, fully mobilized the masses, and taken the capitalist roaders within our factory and other class enemies as "live targets," with China's Khrushchev as the main target, to continuously carry out revolutionary criticism. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we have firmly grasped class struggle and launched continuous attacks on the enemies of the proletariat. This has not only severely struck the enemies, eliminating the poison of Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionism, but also raised the class consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of workers, greatly promoting the revolutionization of workers' thoughts. The entire factory presents a thriving and vibrant scene. In April, the total output exceeded the plan by 6.3 percent, and in the first ten days of May, the output again exceeded the plan. The workers say: "Widespread revolutionary criticism brings a new look to production; deep revolutionary criticism leaves no escape for class enemies; sustained revolutionary criticism secures the red land firmly."

Revolutionary criticism is an important means for us proletarian revolutionaries to attack class enemies, an important weapon to thoroughly smash the rightist reversal wind, and also a powerful guarantee to consolidate and strengthen the newly born revolutionary committee. We are determined, under the guidance of the "Notice," to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to carry out revolutionary criticism to the end, to let the East Wind always prevail over the West Wind, and to let the proletariat always prevail over the bourgeoisie!

    坚持开展革命大批判  让东风永远压倒西风
    上海矽钢片厂革命委员会
    在国内外一片大好形势下，全国亿万军民以高昂的战斗热情，隆重纪念我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的《通知》发表两周年。正在这时候，《划时代的文献》这篇重要文章，又传来了伟大领袖毛主席和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的声音，给了我们极大的鼓舞，增强了我们战斗的力量。我们最衷心地祝愿我们心中最红的红太阳、我们的伟大导师毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    两年来，无产阶级文化大革命的群众运动，对一小撮阶级敌人进行了广泛、深入的革命的大批判。毛主席说，
  “他们是一群反共、反人民的反革命分子，他们同我们的斗争是你死我活的斗争，丝毫谈不到什么平等。因此，我们对他们的斗争也只能是一场你死我活的斗争，我们对他们的关系绝对不是什么平等的关系，而是一个阶级压迫另一个阶级的关系，即无产阶级对资产阶级实行独裁或专政的关系，而不能是什么别的关系，例如所谓平等关系、被剥削阶级同剥削阶级的和平共处关系、仁义道德关系等等。”
    正如《划时代的文献》中所指出的：“在政治思想领域中，不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，不是无产阶级压倒资产阶级，就是资产阶级压倒无产阶级。没有中间道路可走。”抓不抓革命的大批判，是不是坚持让东风压倒西风，让无产阶级压倒资产阶级，这是忠不忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠不忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，忠不忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的大问题。如果放松了革命大批判，反革命修正主义的流毒就不能肃清，有朝一日，就会西风压倒东风，就会资产阶级压倒无产阶级。只有深入、持久地开展革命大批判，从各方面肃清反革命修正主义的流毒，挖掉修正主义的祸根，东风才能永远压倒西风，无产阶级才能永远压倒资产阶级，这才能保证我们的社会主义红色江山永不变色。
    在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中，我们厂的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，夺回了被党内一小撮走资派所篡夺的党政财文大权，取得了无产阶级文化大革命决定性的胜利。因为胜利，我们有些同志就放松了革命警惕，认为党内走资派已是“死老虎”，“几条泥鳅翻不了大浪”，等等。可是，“树欲静而风不止”，阶级斗争的规律是不以人们的意志为转移的。被打倒的党内走资派和形形色色的阶级敌人并不甘心死亡，他们采取了更为狡猾、更为隐蔽的手法来对付我们。他们时而装死躺下，时而露出凶相，玩弄反革命两面派手法。他们配合社会上一股右倾翻案妖风，进行了猖狂的反扑。有个死不悔改的走资派，甚至勾结一小撮反革命分子，妄图谋害革委会中的革命群众组织负责人，实行反革命夺权。
    这一系列触目惊心的阶级斗争的事实，教育了全厂广大革命职工，使大家明确认识到，我们同阶级敌人的斗争是你死我活的斗争，你不斗它，它就斗你，你不吃掉它，它就要吃掉你。正如《划时代的文献》中所说：“在无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级革命派对资产阶级反动派，对毒草，对没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，就是要坚决斗争，坚决批判。无产阶级就是要压倒资产阶级，对他们决不能讲什么‘平等’。”
    一年来，我们在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，遵循伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示，充分发动群众，以本厂党内走资派和其他阶级敌人为“活靶子”，以中国赫鲁晓夫为总目标，持续地开展了革命的大批判。由于在毛泽东思想的指引下，狠抓阶级斗争，不停顿地向无产阶级的敌人主动进攻，这样既狠狠地打击了敌人，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义的流毒，同时也提高了广大职工的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟，大大促进了职工思想的革命化。全厂革命和生产呈现一片欣欣向荣、热气腾腾的景象。今年四月份总产量超过计划百分之六点三，五月上旬产量又超额完成计划。工人同志们说：“革命大批判广泛搞，生产出现新面貌；革命大批判深入搞，阶级敌人逃不了；革命大批判持久搞，红色江山保得牢。”
    革命大批判，是我们无产阶级革命派向阶级敌人进攻的重要手段，是当前彻底粉碎右倾翻案妖风的重要武器，也是巩固和加强新生的革命委员会的有力保证。我们决心在《通知》的指引下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把革命的大批判进行到底，让东风永远压倒西风，无产阶级永远压倒资产阶级！
