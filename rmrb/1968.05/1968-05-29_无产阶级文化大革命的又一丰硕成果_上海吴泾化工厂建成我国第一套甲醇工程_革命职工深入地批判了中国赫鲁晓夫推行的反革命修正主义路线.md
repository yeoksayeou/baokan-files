Shanghai Wujing Chemical Plant's proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary workers, in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have displayed the spirit of self-reliance, successfully building China's first self-designed, self-manufactured, and self-constructed methanol project with a new level of technology. This is a great victory for the thought of Chairman Mao, and another bountiful fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Methanol is an important chemical raw material for the production of pesticides, pharmaceuticals, plastics, synthetic fibers, and dyes. Developing methanol production is an important link in strengthening China's chemical industry. On the eve of May Day, this methanol project was successful in its first trial run and is now producing high-purity methanol, supplying Shanghai's relevant factories.

The "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by the great leader Chairman Mao states: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful impetus for the development of social productive forces in our country." During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary workers of Wujing Chemical Plant have deeply criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai and the unit, breaking the old frameworks and regulations that shackled the workers' hands and feet. As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution flourished, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line became increasingly ingrained in people's hearts. Some young and vigorous workers and technicians, following Chairman Mao's teachings on "the necessity for mankind to constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, and creations, and make progress," set ambitious goals and resolved to use a new technology pioneered in China to design a methanol project with a new level of technology.

During the design process, the broad revolutionary workers engaged in a struggle against bourgeois ideology. A few people deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology advocated building according to existing foreign designs, believing that this was a "shortcut," "fast and reliable." However, young workers and designers believed that foreign designs had long process flows, with more and larger equipment, and complex structures, which were actually a path of less, slower, poorer, and more expensive. Designing according to China's pioneering new technology, although more difficult, had an advanced process flow, fewer and smaller equipment, easier manufacturing, and greater methanol production capacity. This was a path of more, faster, better, and cheaper in line with Mao Zedong Thought. The young workers and designers' spirit of insisting on the path of self-reliance won the support of the broad revolutionary workers, and their proposed design route won victory, smoothly advancing the design work.

Following the great leader Chairman Mao's long-standing teachings on "strategically despising difficulties and tactically respecting difficulties, having both sky-high enthusiasm and scientific analysis," the more than twenty workers, young technicians, and revolutionary cadres involved in the methanol project design went to old factories in other places multiple times to conduct investigations and research. During the investigation and research process, they humbly learned from revolutionary workers with the most practical experience and broadly solicited the opinions of revolutionary masses on the project design. Due to a lack of experience, the initial design was not perfect, so they repeatedly revised it based on various opinions. They studied Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind and went to some factories for advice. In this way, the design plan gradually improved and the task was successfully completed.

During the design, equipment manufacturing, and installation of the methanol project, the proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary students from many relevant factories and universities in Shanghai and across the country provided enthusiastic support, with some directly participating in the design. The revolutionary workers in the factory's machine repair and manufacturing workshops overcame various difficulties and manufactured more than 80% of the equipment for the methanol project. A small processing plant belonging to an external installation unit set ambitious goals and manufactured large gas holders for the methanol project, ensuring production needs.

The methanol project built by this factory was originally planned to be put into production in the third quarter of this year. Revolutionary workers, to more powerfully counterattack the domestic and foreign class enemies' slanders against China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, decided to advance the production start date to before May Day. The broad revolutionary workers were spirited, full of fighting spirit, and united in their efforts, working day and night. Finally, on April 28, the first trial run was successful, and qualified products were produced for the first time.

    无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕成果
    上海吴泾化工厂建成我国第一套甲醇工程
    革命职工深入地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义路线
    新华社上海二十六日电　上海吴泾化工厂无产阶级革命派和革命职工，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，发扬自力更生的革命精神，建造成功我国第一套自行设计、自行制造设备、自行施工的具有新水平的甲醇工程，这是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕成果。
    甲醇是制造农药、医药、塑料、合成纤维和染料等产品的重要化工原料，发展甲醇生产是加强我国化学工业建设的一个重要环节。在“五一”国际劳动节前夕，这套甲醇工程一次试车就获得成功，现在正源源生产出高纯度的甲醇，供应上海各有关工厂。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，吴泾化工厂的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，深入地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海和本单位的代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线，大破了束缚职工手脚的旧框框、旧条条。随着无产阶级文化大革命的蓬勃开展，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线日益深入人心，一些朝气蓬勃的青年工人和技术人员，遵循毛主席关于“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”的教导，树雄心，立壮志，决心采用我国首创的一项新技术，着手设计一套具有新水平的甲醇工程。
    在设计过程中，广大革命职工同资产阶级思想展开了斗争。少数受资产阶级思想影响较深的人，主张按国外已有的设计来建设，认为这样做是“抄近路”，“既快又稳妥可靠”。但是，青年工人和设计人员认为，国外设计的工艺流程长，设备既多又大，而且结构繁杂，实际上是一条少慢差费的道路。按照我国首创的新技术来设计，虽然困难较大，但这种工艺的流程先进，设备比较少而小，制造比较方便，而生产甲醇的能力却比较大，这是一条符合毛泽东思想的多快好省的道路。青年工人和设计人员坚持走自力更生道路的精神，得到了广大革命职工的支持，他们所主张的设计路线赢得了胜利，设计工作顺利地展开了。
    根据伟大领袖毛主席历来提出的在战略上要藐视困难、在战术上要重视困难，既要有冲天的干劲，又要有科学分析的精神的教导，从事甲醇工程设计的二十多个工人、青年技术人员和革命干部，多次分头到外地的老厂，进行调查研究。在调查研究过程中，他们虚心地向最有实践经验的革命职工学习，广泛地征求革命群众对工程设计的意见。由于缺乏经验，开始时设计得不够完善，他们就根据各方面的意见，反复进行修改。他们带着问题学习毛主席著作，并到一些工厂去请教。这样，终于使设计方案逐步完善起来，胜利地完成了任务。
    在甲醇工程的设计、设备制造和安装的过程中，上海以及全国许多有关工厂、高等学校的无产阶级革命派和革命师生，都热情地给予支持，有些人直接参加了设计。本厂机修制造等车间的革命职工，克服了种种困难，制造了甲醇工程百分之八十以上的设备。厂外安装单位所属的一个小加工厂，树雄心，立壮志，为甲醇工程制造了大型的气柜，保证了生产的需要。
    这个厂建造的这套甲醇工程，原计划在今年第三季度投入生产。革命职工们为了更有力地反击国内外阶级敌人对我国无产阶级文化大革命的污蔑，决定提前在“五一”国际劳动节前投入生产。广大革命职工精神振奋，斗志昂扬，群策群力，日夜奋战，终于在四月二十八日一次试车成功，第一次就生产出了合格的产品。
