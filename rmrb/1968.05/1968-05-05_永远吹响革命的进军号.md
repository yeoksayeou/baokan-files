	Forever Sound the Marching Call of the Revolution

	The "Red Children" Brigade, an advanced collective in the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in Benxi County, Lǐ Míngchūn, Gě Jūzhōng

	At a time when our national economy is facing temporary difficulties, Chinese Khrushchev and the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries together launch attacks on us, claiming that "industry must retreat sufficiently, and agriculture must also retreat sufficiently, including the contracting of production to households and individual farming." They are spreading the black wind of "three freedoms and one contract." The bad elements and rich peasants in our brigade incite the commune members to engage in "small reclamation." Some of the children have also been poisoned by the "small reclamation" and have grown the idea of "self-interest."

	At that time, our school organized everyone to go to the brigade for voluntary labor. Some children then backed out and asked for leave to go home to help their families tend to the small plots of land. One is labor for the collective, and the other is labor for the individual. The activities are different, and the thoughts and feelings cultivated are different. Working for the collective cultivates the spirit of "public interest"; working for one's own family cultivates the spirit of "self-interest." "Small reclamation" is a breeding ground for "self-interest." "Self-interest" is the root of revisionism. With "self-interest," it is easy to become a captive of the bourgeoisie and gradually become the successor of the bourgeoisie. Chinese Khrushchev shouts about "sufficient retreat," which means to retreat the collective economy to individual farming, to retreat the spirit of "public interest" to "self-interest," and to retreat socialism to capitalism. Chinese Khrushchev, at every critical juncture of the revolution, opposes our great leader Chairman Mao. He is a thoroughgoing old counter-revolutionary.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the forward march of history, revolution will inevitably occur and will certainly be victorious, whether sooner or later."

	Chinese Khrushchev wants to stop the revolution from advancing, but it is in vain. For the socialist revolution and socialist construction, for the realization of communism throughout the world, we must forever sound the marching call of the revolution.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "One of the important tasks on our ideological front at present is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." We are Chairman Mao's red children and listen most to Chairman Mao's words. We will carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, uproot the "self-interest" root, eliminate the poison of revisionism, and hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We will forever be Chairman Mao's red children.

　　永远吹响革命的进军号
　　本溪县活学活用毛主席著作先进集体“红孩子”队  李明春　葛居忠
    在我国国民经济出现暂时困难的时候，中国赫鲁晓夫和帝、修、反一道向我们进攻，胡说什么：“工业上要退够，农业上也要退够，包括包产到户、单干。”他们大刮“三自一包”的黑风。我们大队里的坏人和富农分子就煽动社员搞“小开荒”。有的小朋友也受了“小开荒”的毒害，滋长了“私”字。
    那时，我们学校组织大家到队里去义务劳动，有的小朋友就打退堂鼓，请假回家帮助家里侍弄小荒地。同样是劳动，一个是为集体，一个是为个人。干的是两样活，培养的是两种思想感情。给集体干活，培养的是一个“公”字；给自己家里干活，培养的是一个“私”字。“小开荒”是培养“私”字的温床。“私”字是产生修正主义的根子。有了“私”字，就容易当资产阶级的俘虏，慢慢地变成资产阶级的接班人。中国赫鲁晓夫叫喊要“退够”，就是要把集体经济退成单干，把“公”字退成“私”字，使社会主义退到资本主义。中国赫鲁晓夫在革命的每个节骨眼上，都和我们伟大领袖毛主席唱反调，他是一个地地道道的老反革命。
    毛主席教导我们说：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫想要阻止革命前进，只能是白费劲。为了社会主义革命和社会主义建设，为了在全世界实现共产主义，我们要永远吹响革命的进军号。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”我们是毛主席的红孩子，最听毛主席的话。我们要深入持久地开展革命大批判，挖掉“私”根，肃清修正主义流毒，我们要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远做毛主席的红孩子。
