The Albanian "Unity" Newspaper strongly condemns the U.S. and Soviet Union's attempt to rush through the "Non-Proliferation Treaty" draft at this session of the United Nations. The commentary points out that the "Non-Proliferation Treaty" draft and the "Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty" signed in Moscow a few years ago are complementary to each other. They are both serving the sinister policies of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists in their counter-revolutionary strategies, and are the result of the secret and open cooperation between the U.S. and the Soviet Union to dominate the world.

The commentary states that the draft treaty, formulated according to the will of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists, is essentially another step in implementing the great conspiracy of the Glassboro talks. It is known that after the Glassboro talks, the U.S. imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists further strengthened their cooperation. The "Non-Proliferation Treaty" draft is serving their counter-revolutionary policies.

The commentary says that despite the U.S. imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists operating the voting machines and various conspiracies in the United Nations, they will never deceive the people of various countries and suppress the surging revolutionary waves around the world. Their nuclear weapons and military power will not intimidate the people of various countries. Great China has already broken the U.S.-Soviet nuclear monopoly, greatly inspiring humanity. Life has proven that revolution and the people of various countries are invincible, while the various conspiracies of the imperialists and revisionists are doomed to failure.

    阿《团结报》强烈谴责美苏合伙企图在联大通过“防止核扩散”条约草案
    美苏的罪恶阴谋永远欺骗不了各国人民
    指出“防止核扩散”条约草案是为美苏推行反革命战略服务的
    新华社地拉那十二日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》十二日发表评论，强烈谴责美苏合伙在这次联合国大会上迫不及待地企图通过“防止核扩散”条约草案的罪恶阴谋。评论指出，“防止核扩散”条约草案和几年前在莫斯科签订的“部分禁止核试验条约”是互相补充的。它们都是为美帝国主义者和苏联现代修正主义者推行反革命战略的阴谋政策效劳的，是美苏为实现主宰世界的秘密和公开的合作的产物。
    评论说，美帝国主义者和苏联现代修正主义者根据他们的意志制订的这个条约草案，实质上是实现美苏葛拉斯堡罗会谈大阴谋的又一步骤。众所周知，在葛拉斯堡罗会谈后，美帝国主义者和苏联现代修正主义者进一步加强了他们的合作。“防止核扩散”条约草案就是为他们的反革命方针服务的。
    评论说，尽管美帝国主义者和苏联现代修正主义者在联合国开动表决机器和施展种种阴谋，但是，他们永远欺骗不了各国人民，压制不了世界各地汹涌翻腾的革命浪潮。他们的核武器和军事实力吓不倒世界各国人民。伟大的人民中国早已打破了美苏核垄断，使人类受到极大鼓舞。生活最好不过地证明，革命和各国人民是永远不可征服的，而帝国主义者和修正主义者的各种阴谋必将遭到破产。
