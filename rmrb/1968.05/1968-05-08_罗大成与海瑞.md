"The Storm" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" were released in 1961 and 1962 respectively. These two "works" complement each other and are closely coordinated, both aiming to vindicate the dismissed ambitious and scheming plotter Peng Dehuai, attempting to rehabilitate him. This is a poisonous weed.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: The key issue in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is "dismissal from office." The Jiaqing Emperor dismissed Hai Rui from office, and in 1959, we dismissed Peng Dehuai from office. Peng Dehuai is also a "Hai Rui." The key issue in the reactionary film "The Storm" is also dismissal from office. In the film, the Central Committee's special envoy Wang Huizhi dismisses Luo Dacheng from office. Luo Dacheng is the incarnation of Peng Dehuai.

"The Storm" portrays Luo Dacheng as a "revolutionary leader" of the peasants and a "hero" who "survives death to make revolution, fighting through gunfire and bullets to kill the enemy." He is depicted as someone who is always "correct" and dares to uphold "truth." When he is removed from all his "internal and external party positions" by the Central Committee's special envoy, he still firmly says: "I can go to the district party committee, but the peasant self-defense corps cannot be disbanded!" This is very similar to Hai Rui's words in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" when he was dismissed from office: "Dismissing me from office is unjust," and "A true man stands tall and firm, how can he fear the danger of losing his life?" In this way, "The Storm" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" both beautify Peng Dehuai into a "hero" who is not afraid of being "dismissed from office" or "facing death." Even more vile is that both the play and the film attempt to tell people: The wrong central leadership dismisses the "correct" subordinate from office. In "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," the incompetent Jiaqing Emperor dismisses Hai Rui, who upholds "justice," from office. In "The Storm," the opportunist party Central Committee special envoy Wang Huizhi dismisses Luo Dacheng, who upholds the correct line, from office. Both the play and the film shout: The central leadership "dismissing me from office is unjust." They directly aim their arrows at the Party Central Committee and our beloved leader Chairman Mao. This is intolerable!

After Luo Dacheng is dismissed from office, the film also depicts the masses, old and young, coming to see him off, and through the mouth of the old fisherman, singing about how "the hearts of the farmers and fellow villagers are bright," "across mountains and rivers, we will always look out for each other," "in the wind and waves, you sail the ship, and I hold the torch to wait for your return," and so on. This is very similar to the songs in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" after Hai Rui is dismissed from office: "Hai Rui returns south and cannot be stopped, ten thousand households burn incense to the living Buddha," "fail and try again," "one day I will return to office and restore order." From the lines, one can clearly see their ferocious and murderous faces, and clearly see their wild ambition to stage a comeback and rise again!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." Whether it is "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" or "The Storm," they are both preparing counter-revolutionary public opinion for Peng Dehuai to return to power and usurp the proletarian dictatorship. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly criticize and expose them!

　　罗大成与海瑞

    《怒潮》与《海瑞罢官》在一九六一、一九六二年先后出笼。这两部“作品”互相呼应，紧密配合，都是为被罢了官的大野心家、大阴谋家彭德怀鸣冤叫屈，妄图为他翻案的大毒草。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席曾经指出：《海瑞罢官》的“要害问题是‘罢官’。嘉靖皇帝罢了海瑞的官，一九五九年我们罢了彭德怀的官。彭德怀也是‘海瑞’。”反动影片《怒潮》的要害也是罢官，影片里的党中央特派员王怀志罢了罗大成的官，罗大成就是彭德怀的化身。
    《怒潮》把罗大成描写成为一个农民的“革命领袖”和“死里逃生闹革命，枪林弹雨把敌杀”的“英雄”。他是一个一贯“正确”，敢于坚持“真理”的典型。当他被中央特派员撤销了“党内外一切职务”的时候，依然坚毅地说：“我可以去区党委，工农自卫队不能解散！”这与《海瑞罢官》中刚直不阿的海瑞被罢官时所说的“将我罢职理不公”、“大丈夫顶天立地，岂可怕杀身之祸”，是多么相似！就这样，《怒潮》和《海瑞罢官》一样，把彭德怀美化成一个不怕“撤职”、不怕“杀身之祸”的“英雄”。更恶毒的是，《怒潮》和《海瑞罢官》都企图告诉人们：错误的中央领导人罢了“正确”的下级的“官”。在《海瑞罢官》里，昏庸无能的嘉靖皇帝罢了坚持“正义”的海瑞的官。在《怒潮》里，机会主义的党中央特派员王怀志罢了坚持正确路线的罗大成的官。这个戏和影片都在叫嚷：中央“将我罢职理不公”。把矛头直接对准党中央和我们敬爱的领袖毛主席。是可忍，孰不可忍！
    罗大成被罢官之后，影片还描写了群众扶老携幼，齐来相送，并且还借渔鼓老人的口大唱什么“农友乡亲心里亮”“隔山隔水永相望”，什么“风里浪里你行船，我执梭标望君还”，等等。这与《海瑞罢官》中海瑞被罢官后所唱的“海父南归留不住，万家生佛把香烧”，“失败了再干”，“有一日再居官重整纪纲”，又何其相似！从字里行间简直可以看出他们那副咬牙切齿、杀气腾腾的狰狞面目，可以清楚地看出他们妄图卷土重来，东山再起的狼子野心！
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”不管是《海瑞罢官》还是《怒潮》，都是为彭德怀重新上台，篡夺无产阶级政权而做反革命舆论准备的。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把它们批深、批臭！
