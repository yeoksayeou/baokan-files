The progressive student movement in the United States has seen an unprecedented surge. The strike at Columbia University has lasted for over a month, an event unparalleled in American history. This situation indicates that American youth are becoming increasingly aware.

Columbia University holds a special position in the United States. Along with Yale University, Harvard University, and Princeton University, it is known as one of the four most prestigious "institutions of higher learning." It is a crucial place where the American monopolistic bourgeoisie cultivates their successors and high-level advisors, and it has long been known for its conservatism. However, as the American ruling class increasingly pursues extremely reactionary policies, students at this university have now risen up in rebellion.

For over a month, students have repeatedly occupied the university's buildings, hoisted red flags, and red balloons with white "strike" characters floating in the campus. The campus is plastered with various leaflets, and loudspeakers broadcast impassioned speeches. The lawns or steps of the buildings have become stages for satirical performances about the school administration and the board of trustees, and classrooms for discussing various issues in the student movement. Moreover, students have detained the dean and searched the office of the university president, Kirk, uncovering a large amount of evidence of Kirk's correspondence with American intelligence chief Hoover and the Central Intelligence Agency. In fact, the student masses have controlled the entire school.

The struggle at Columbia University reflects the growing dissatisfaction of progressive students in the United States with the decaying capitalist system. A student leader at the university, in response to the unreasonable accusations of President Kirk, bluntly pointed out that "American society is sick, and you and your capitalism are the root of the problem." This is precisely what the students want to destroy.

The clear political slogans and demands put forward by Columbia University students in their struggle are representative of the current progressive student movement in the United States. These slogans and demands can be broadly categorized into three areas: opposition to racial discrimination, demanding the cessation of the occupation of Harlem's public park by black people to build a school sports field; opposition to the Vietnam War, demanding that the school sever its close ties with the "Institute for Defense Analyses," which is closely linked to the Vietnam War; and opposition to political persecution, demanding that the school not punish progressive students who participate in the student movement.

Columbia University is adjacent to the largest black slum in the United States—New York's Harlem. Columbia University itself is the largest landowner in Harlem, often evicting many black families under the guise of "urban renewal" to expand its campus. Recently, Columbia University has again attempted to occupy Harlem's public park to build a sports field, sparking strong opposition from the black residents of Harlem. The "Institute for Defense Analyses" is a "research institution" led by the defeated general in Vietnam, Taylor. It is currently focusing on researching weapons and equipment needed for the Vietnam War and suppressing the violent struggles of American blacks. Therefore, its evil activities have been strongly opposed by the American people.

These slogans have quickly united more than 80% of the student body at Columbia University, including black and white students, as well as the black masses in Harlem. The struggle of the progressive students at Columbia University continues, and they are further gathering strength to welcome a new and larger wave of struggle.

    美国进步学生运动出现历史上从未有过的高涨
    哥伦比亚大学学生罢课斗争坚持一个多月
    据新华社三十日讯  华盛顿消息：震动全美国的纽约哥伦比亚大学学生反对种族歧视、反对侵越战争、反对政治迫害的大罢课已坚持一个多月，这在美国历史上是从来没有过的。这种情况说明美国青年正在日益觉醒。
    哥伦比亚大学在美国占有特殊的地位，它和耶鲁大学、哈佛大学以及普林斯顿大学被称为美国最著名的四所“高等学府”，是美国垄断资产阶级培养他们的接班人和高级谋士的重要场所，一向以保守闻名。但是，随着美国统治集团日益疯狂地推行极端反动的政策，现在这所学校的学生也起来造反了。
    一个多月来，学生们几次占领了学校的大楼，升起了红旗，红色气球漆着白色的“罢课”字样在校园内飘荡。校园里张贴着各种传单，扩音器里播送着激情的演说，草地或大楼的台阶，成了演出讽刺学校行政当局和董事会的活报剧的舞台，成了讨论学生运动中各种问题的课堂。不仅如此，学生们还曾扣押了教务长，搜查了校长柯克的办公室，搜出了柯克和美国特务头子胡佛以及中央情报局来往的大批证据。事实上学生群众控制了整个学校。
    哥伦比亚大学学生的斗争反映了美国进步学生对腐朽的资本主义制度日益增长的不满。这所学校的一个学生领袖在回答校长柯克的无理指责时，直接了当地指出，美国“社会已生了病，而你们和你们的资本主义就是病根子”，这正是学生要摧毁的。
    哥伦比亚大学学生在斗争中提出来的鲜明的政治口号和要求，在当前美国进步学生运动中是具有代表性的。这些口号和要求基本上有三个方面：反对种族歧视，要求停止侵占哈莱姆区黑人的公园来修建学校的运动场；反对侵越战争，要求学校停止和侵越战争有密切联系的“国防分析研究所”的罪恶关系；反对政治迫害，要求学校不得处分参加学生运动的进步学生。
    哥伦比亚大学和美国最大的黑人贫民窟——纽约的哈莱姆区相毗邻，哥伦比亚大学本身就是哈莱姆区最大的房产主，它经常在“城市更新”的名义下赶走许多黑人住家来扩充校舍。最近，哥伦比亚大学又要侵占哈莱姆区的公园来修建运动场，引起了哈莱姆区黑人的强烈反对。美国“国防分析研究所”是以越南人民手下败将泰勒为首的一个“研究机构”，它目前正集中研究侵越战争和镇压美国黑人抗暴斗争所需的武器和装备。所以它的罪恶活动遭到美国人民的强烈反对。
    这些口号，迅速地团结了哥伦比亚大学全校百分之八十以上的学生群众，其中包括黑人学生和白人学生，也团结了哈莱姆区的黑人群众。哥伦比亚大学进步学生的斗争，仍在坚持中，他们正在进一步积聚力量，迎接新的更大规模的斗争高潮。
