New Zealand Communist Party General Secretary Wilcox Issues a Statement: Chairman Mao's Statement is a Call to Action
New Zealand Communist Party Fully Welcomes and Supports Chairman Mao's Statement on the Just Struggle of American Blacks Against Violence

	WELLINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) — New Zealand Communist Party General Secretary Wilcox issued a statement on behalf of the New Zealand Communist Party Central Committee on April 29, warmly welcoming Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. The title of Wilcox's statement is "Chairman Mao's Statement is a Call to Action." The full text is as follows:

	"The New Zealand Communist Party fully welcomes and supports Chairman Mao Zedong's statement on the just struggle of American blacks against violence.

	"This statement is a timely and powerful call to action, which will receive an active response from the working people and progressive forces in New Zealand and other countries.

	"The leader of the world revolutionary movement clearly points out in this statement how the struggle of American blacks is combined with the struggle of the peoples of all countries against the main enemy of humanity, American imperialism.

	"He also once again points out that the oppression suffered by American blacks is class oppression, and that the fundamental interests of white and black working people lie in their common struggle to end the rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie.

	"This is a very important document at the present time because the reactionary forces in the world are currently using racism to divide the working class and divert the common struggle of workers against their true enemy, the monopolistic capitalists.

	"Comrade Mao Zedong also sketches a clear picture of the development of the world revolution today in his statement.

	"The entire statement is well worth serious study by Marxist-Leninists, class-conscious workers, and all those who oppose American imperialism and are willing to oppose American imperialism."

    新华社惠灵顿三十日电　新西兰共产党总书记威尔科克斯四月二十九日代表新西兰共产党全国书记处发表声明，热烈欢迎毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。威尔科克斯同志的声明题目是《毛主席的声明是行动的号召书》，全文如下：
    “新西兰共产党完全欢迎和支持毛泽东主席关于美国黑人抗暴正义斗争的声明。
    “这个声明是一个及时的和强有力的行动号召书，它将得到新西兰和其他国家的劳动人民和进步力量的积极响应。
    “世界革命运动的领袖在这个声明中清楚地指明了，美国黑人斗争是怎样同各国人民反对人类的主要敌人美帝国主义的斗争相结合的。
    “他还再次指明，美国黑人所受的压迫是阶级压迫，白人和黑人劳动人民的根本利益是共同斗争以结束垄断资产阶级的统治。
    “这是目前一个非常重要的文件，因为目前国际上的反动势力正在利用种族主义来分裂工人阶级，转移工人为反对他们的真正敌人垄断资本家而进行的共同斗争。
    “毛泽东同志在声明中还给今天世界革命的发展勾划了一幅清晰的图画。
    “整个声明值得马克思列宁主义者，有阶级觉悟的工人，以及一切反对美帝国主义和愿意反对美帝国主义的人们非常认真地学习。”
