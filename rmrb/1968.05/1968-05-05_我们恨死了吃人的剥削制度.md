	We hate the exploitative system that devours people.
	Poor peasant community member Wu Wanying

	The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “In the countryside, eliminate the rich peasant economy and individual economy, and make all rural people prosperous together.” This is his greatest concern for the five hundred million peasants, and it clearly points the direction for the socialist revolution in rural areas. However, the agent of landlords and rich peasants, Chinese Khrushchev, always looks for ways to harm us poor and lower-middle peasants, making us suffer twice, and not allowing us to follow the socialist path. He says: “What is laissez-faire? Hiring laborers, individual farming, should be allowed to develop freely, let them have three horses and a plow, that would be good. Those who do not allow hiring laborers and individual farming cannot be left alone, and those who interfere with having three horses cannot be left alone.” Look at how much he hates socialism and how much he loves the wicked private ownership system.

	Only landlords and rich peasants would praise hiring laborers and individual farming. In the dark old society, they used this method to cruelly exploit the poor and lower-middle peasants. I am seventy-five years old this year, and the sufferings I endured in the old society are countless! At that time, my family had no house and no land. My husband had to work as a long-term laborer for the landlord. He ate like pigs and dogs, worked like oxen and horses, and toiled all year without a full meal. He fell ill and died young without money for treatment. I raised my son for five whole years, and only with great difficulty did I manage to raise the child to about ten years old. Poor people have no other way out, so I had to let him go and work for the landlord. The cruel landlord only cared about his own wealth, not the lives of the poor, forcing a fourteen or fifteen-year-old child to get up at dawn and work until late at night, doing labor that even adults find difficult. The child was so exhausted that he could not bear it and ran back home crying. The dog landlord chased him to my house, beating him mercilessly. I could not bear it anymore, so I rushed over to protect the child. The dog landlord’s stick rained down on me, beating me until I was covered in injuries. My right hand was broken, and I still have scars today. Hiring laborers, this is a knife that kills without blood. Landlords and rich peasants rely on hiring laborers to exploit, sucking the blood and sweat of long-term laborers, and fattening their own bellies. Talking about it, I have endless bitter tears and endless hatred in my heart. After liberation, the great leader Chairman Mao saved us from the sea of suffering and led us on the path of collectivization. Only then did we poor and lower-middle peasants walk the path to happiness, no longer being long-term laborers, no longer being exploited, and no longer being oppressed. Chinese Khrushchev, however, came up with one bad idea after another, wanting to allow hiring laborers and individual farming to develop freely, and also wanting to implement the “three freedoms and one contract,” restoring the private ownership system that devours people. This is like releasing wolves from their cages, allowing the defeated landlords and rich peasants to exploit and oppress us poor and lower-middle peasants again. After he spread the black wind of “three freedoms and one contract” and individual farming, some wealthy peasants in our village with severe capitalist tendencies engaged in “small reclamation,” promoted individual farming, and engaged in speculation, becoming richer and richer. Meanwhile, some poor and lower-middle peasants became poorer and poorer. If it were not for Chairman Mao leading the revolutionary masses to timely repel this evil wind, would the poor and lower-middle peasants not have suffered again?

	We poor and lower-middle peasants hate the exploitative system to death. We have long been determined to follow Chairman Mao on the socialist path! We must resolutely overthrow the representative of landlords and the bourgeoisie, Chinese Khrushchev, and thoroughly eliminate the poison of the “three freedoms and one contract.” Whoever promotes capitalism, we will resolutely overthrow them.

### 我们恨死了吃人的剥削制度

　　我们恨死了吃人的剥削制度
　　贫农社员　吴万英
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“在农村中消灭富农经济制度和个体经济制度，使全体农村人民共同富裕起来。”这是他老人家对五亿农民的最大关怀，为农村的社会主义革命指出了明确的方向。可是，地主、富农的代理人中国赫鲁晓夫总是寻方设法坑害我们贫下中农，要我们受二遍苦，不让我们走社会主义道路。他说：“什么才是放任自流呢？雇工，单干，应该放任自流，让他都有三匹马一副犁就很好，对于不让雇工不让单干的不能放任，对于去干涉有三匹马的，不能放任。”你看他对社会主义多么恨，对万恶的私有制度多么爱。
    把雇工、单干捧上天的，只能是地主、富农。在黑暗的旧社会，他们就是用这个办法残酷剥削贫下中农的。我今年七十五岁了，在旧社会里受过的苦真是说不完道不尽啊！那个时候，我家房无一间，地无一垄。孩子他爹只好给地主当长工。他吃的是猪狗食，干的是牛马活，一年累到头吃不上一顿饱饭，弄得一身是病，没钱医治，年轻轻的就病死了。我领着儿子整整要了五年饭，好容易把孩子拉扯到十来岁，穷人没别的活路，只好让他去给地主扛活。狠心的地主只管自己发财，不顾穷人死活，逼着十四、五岁的孩子起五更睡半夜，干大人都感到吃力的活。孩子累得实在受不了就哭着跑回家来，狗地主拿棍子撵到我家来，劈头盖脑地毒打。我实在忍不住了，就扑上去护住孩子，狗地主的棍子就雨点似地落在我身上，打得我满身是伤，右手被打断了骨头，现在还落下伤疤。雇工，这是一把杀人不见血的刀子，地主、富农就是靠雇工剥削，吸干了长工的血汗，肥了自己的肚肠。提起它，我有说不尽的辛酸泪，止不住的心头恨。解放了，伟大领袖毛主席把我们救出了苦海，又领我们走集体化的道路，咱贫下中农才走上了幸福路，再不当长工，再不受剥削，再不受压迫了。中国赫鲁晓夫却出了一个又一个坏道道，要对雇工、单干放任自流，还要搞“三自一包”，恢复吃人的私有制度，这是放狼出笼，让被打倒的地主、富农又来剥削和压迫我们贫下中农。就在他刮起“三自一包”单干的黑风之后，我们村有的资本主义倾向严重的富裕农民，大搞“小开荒”，闹单干，搞投机倒把，越来越富；而有的贫下中农却越来越穷。要不是毛主席及时领导革命群众打退了这股妖风，贫下中农的苦日子不是又回来了吗！
    我们贫下中农恨死了剥削制度。我们跟毛主席走社会主义道路早就铁心啦！我们要坚决打倒地主、资产阶级的代表中国赫鲁晓夫，彻底肃清“三自一包”的流毒。谁要搞资本主义，我们就坚决打倒谁。
