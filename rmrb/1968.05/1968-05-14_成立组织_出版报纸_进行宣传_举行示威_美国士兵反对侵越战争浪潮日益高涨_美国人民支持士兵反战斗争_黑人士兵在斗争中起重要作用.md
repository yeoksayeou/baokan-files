	Establishing organizations, publishing newspapers, conducting propaganda, holding demonstrations
	The wave of American soldiers opposing the Vietnam War is surging
	American people support soldiers' anti-war struggles; Black soldiers play a crucial role

	BEIJING, May 13 (Xinhua) -- WASHINGTON -- In recent periods, an increasing number of American soldiers, despite the tight surveillance of spies and the fascist suppression by reactionary officers, have gradually and organizedly launched various activities against the Vietnam War. They are continuously weakening the combat effectiveness of the U.S. military, sometimes even seriously disrupting the operation of the U.S. war machine.

	The April 27 issue of the American "Guardian" weekly revealed: "In the U.S. military, riots, collective desertion, slacking off, organizing unions, and anti-war demonstrations are becoming more frequent."

	Following the riot in October last year by hundreds of soldiers from the 193rd Infantry Brigade at Fort Hood, Texas, who refused to be sent to the Vietnam battlefield, this April saw another soldier riot at the Campbell Army Base in Kansas. A group of soldiers about to be sent to Vietnam fought for several nights, angrily overturning cars, smashing military clubs, and beating the military police who usually bullied them. This news was revealed in a letter from a local soldier. The U.S. reactionary ruling clique, fearing a chain reaction, strictly sealed off any information about this soldier struggle.

	Despite the tight surveillance of spies, the number of soldiers deserting the military is increasing, both domestically and abroad, from U.S. troops in Vietnam to those in Europe. It is reported that the total number of American soldiers refusing to serve in the U.S. military has exceeded 10,000, many of whom have fled to Canada, France, and Sweden, where they have established organizations and published anti-war newspapers to propagate against the Vietnam War to other American soldiers.

	Soldiers seize every opportunity to fight against U.S. aggression policies. At monthly meetings held to indoctrinate soldiers with U.S. imperialist aggression and war policies, soldiers openly propagate against the Vietnam War. Anti-war American soldiers also often use churches as venues, turning prayers into anti-war demonstrations. Some soldiers even choose to become disabled rather than be sent to South Vietnam to be cannon fodder.

	As the anti-war struggle of American soldiers develops, more and more anti-war organizations are emerging among the soldiers. Some organizations propose combining the struggle against racial oppression, the struggle for soldiers' rights, and the anti-war struggle. Based on this requirement, long-term, large-scale resistance movements are being organized among American soldiers. Reactionary officers in the U.S. military are terrified of the active members in soldiers' anti-war organizations. Once they discover someone actively engaged in anti-war activities, they transfer them from their original units. However, what makes them particularly anxious is that these active members, wherever they are transferred, ignite the fire of opposition to the Vietnam War.

	Black soldiers, who are constantly tempered in the struggle against violence and whose political awareness is rapidly increasing, play a very important role in the anti-war struggle. Black soldiers are "second-class citizens" at home and "second-class soldiers" in the invading army, suffering oppression and discrimination. Through their own miserable situation of being deprived of freedom, more and more black soldiers see through Johnson's lie of sending them to Vietnam to "save freedom." A black soldier who refused to be sent to the Far East for service said: I should stay in the United States, in the black ghettos of Detroit, Newark, Chicago, New York, and other places, to fight for the freedom and liberation of blacks. His words represent the voices of many black soldiers. Because black soldiers make up a quarter of the U.S. troops in Vietnam, the strong anti-war sentiment among black soldiers seriously undermines the morale of the U.S. military.

	The anti-war struggle of American soldiers has won the sympathy and enthusiastic support of the broad American people. They publish anti-war newspapers for American soldiers, distribute leaflets at bases and recruitment centers, establish legal consultation agencies for anti-war soldiers, and set up reception and service organizations for soldiers who have fled the U.S. military.

	The "Guardian" weekly pointed out that due to the surge in soldiers' anti-war struggles, "the armed forces have become a new target for active anti-war organizers." This newspaper admits that the broad anti-war struggle of soldiers is powerfully striking at U.S. imperialism.

    成立组织　出版报纸　进行宣传　举行示威
    美国士兵反对侵越战争浪潮日益高涨
    美国人民支持士兵反战斗争　黑人士兵在斗争中起重要作用
    新华社十三日讯　华盛顿消息：最近一个时期来，越来越多的美国士兵，不顾特务的严密监视和反动军官的法西斯镇压，逐步地、有组织地展开各种反对侵越战争的活动，不断地削弱着美国军队的战斗力，有时甚至严重妨碍了美帝战争机器的运转。
    四月二十七日的美国《前卫》周报透露：“在美国军队中，骚乱、集体开小差、怠勤活动、组织联合会和反战示威活动越来越频繁了。”
    继去年十月第一百九十三步兵旅的数百名士兵在得克萨斯州胡德堡掀起暴动、拒绝开赴侵越战场之后，今年四月，在堪萨斯州的坎贝尔堡基地又发生了士兵暴动。一支即将开往越南服役的士兵队伍，一连几晚进行斗争，愤怒地翻倒汽车、砸毁军队俱乐部、殴打平时骑在他们头上作威作福的宪兵。这个消息是当地的一个士兵在一封信中传出的。美国反动统治集团深恐这件事情会引起连锁反应，严密封锁这次士兵斗争的任何情况。
    尽管有特务的严密监视，从美国国内到国外，从侵越美军到驻欧美军中，士兵逃离军队的人数越来越多。据报道，拒绝在美国军队中服役的美国士兵总数已经超过一万人，其中许多逃往加拿大、法国和瑞典，并且在那里成立组织，出版反战报纸，向其他美国士兵进行反对侵越战争的宣传。
    士兵们利用种种机会进行斗争，反对美国的侵略政策。在每月举行的向士兵灌输美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的会议上，士兵们公开进行反对侵越战争的宣传。反战的美国士兵们还经常利用教堂为会场，变祈祷为反战示威。有的士兵甚至宁愿使自己变成残废，也不愿被派到南越去当炮灰。
    随着美国士兵反战斗争的发展，士兵中的反战组织正在不断涌现。有的组织提出的要求是把反对种族压迫的斗争、争取士兵权利的斗争以及反战斗争结合起来，根据这样的要求，在美国士兵中组织长期的、大规模的抵抗运动。美军中的反动军官对士兵反战组织中的积极分子怕得要死。他们一旦发现谁积极从事反战活动，就把他调离原来的单位。然而，使他们特别不安的是，这些积极分子调到哪里，就在哪里点燃反对侵越战争的火种。
    在抗暴斗争中不断受到锻炼、政治觉悟在迅速提高的美国黑人士兵在反战斗争中起着十分重要的作用。黑人士兵在国内是“二等公民”，在侵略军中也是“二等士兵”，受尽了压迫和歧视。通过自己被剥夺了自由的悲惨处境，越来越多的黑人士兵识破了约翰逊所谓派他们去越南是为了“拯救自由”的无耻谎言。一个拒绝被派到远东服役的黑人士兵说：我应该留在美国，在底特律、纽瓦克、芝加哥、纽约等地的黑人贫民窟里，为黑人的自由解放而战斗。他的话代表了许多黑人士兵的声音。由于黑人士兵在侵越美军中占四分之一，黑人士兵的强烈的反战情绪严重地瓦解美军的士气。
    美国士兵的反战斗争得到广大美国人民的同情和热情支持。他们为美国士兵出版反战报纸，在基地和征兵中心散发传单，为反战士兵建立法律谘询机构，为逃离美军的士兵设立接待和服务组织等。
    《前卫》周报指出，由于士兵反战斗争的高涨，“已经使得武装部队成为反战积极分子进行新的组织活动的对象。”这家报纸承认，广大士兵的反战斗争正在有力地打击着美帝国主义。
