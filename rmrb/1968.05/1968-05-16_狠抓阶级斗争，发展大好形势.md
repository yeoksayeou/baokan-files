	Deeply and Persistently Carry Out Revolutionary Criticism
	Fiercely Strike at the Enemies of the Proletariat
	—Selected Articles of Revolutionary Criticism from Changgang Commune, Xingguo County, Jiangxi

	Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, May 15 — The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres of Changgang Commune, Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province, under the leadership of the commune revolutionary committee, are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasping class struggle, and deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism. They are denouncing and attacking China's Khrushchev and other cliques of capitalist roaders within the Party, fiercely striking at the enemies of the proletariat, further developing the favorable situation, and making the revolutionary committee more consolidated. The following are several articles of revolutionary criticism written by the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of this commune.

	Grasp Class Struggle Firmly, Develop the Favorable Situation

	Wu Caifang, Chairman of the Changgang Commune Revolutionary Committee

	The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The situation of the great proletarian cultural revolution throughout the country is excellent, not just fairly good. The overall situation is better than at any other time in the past." Our Changgang Commune, like the rest of the country, is also in an excellent situation.

	Faced with this excellent situation, all members of our revolutionary committee have seriously studied Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, deeply realizing that the closer the great proletarian cultural revolution comes to complete victory, the more complex and profound the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads becomes. In this excellent situation, our commune revolutionary committee, following Chairman Mao's teachings, has led the broad revolutionary masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, firmly grasp class struggle, deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, and fiercely strike at the handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who are desperately struggling. By doing so, we have further developed the excellent situation. Now, the movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works is unprecedentedly high, Mao Zedong Thought is unprecedentedly popular, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is increasingly taking root in people's hearts, revolutionary criticism is being carried out deeply, and the class struggle consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres have greatly increased. Firmly grasping revolutionary criticism has promoted the thought revolutionization of the people, driven production, and currently all production in the entire commune is booming.

	Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The great proletarian cultural revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution waged by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the condition of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses it leads and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's latest instructions most profoundly expound the great significance of the great proletarian cultural revolution and most penetratingly reveal the class content of the great proletarian cultural revolution. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings and carry this great political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes through to the end, not resting until we achieve complete victory.

    深入持久地开展革命大批判
    狠狠地打击无产阶级的敌人
    ——江西兴国县长冈公社革命大批判文章选
    新华社南昌十五日电　江西省兴国县长冈公社的广大贫下中农和干部，在公社革命委员会带领下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判。他们人人口诛笔伐，向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派猛烈开火，狠狠地打击无产阶级的敌人，进一步发展了大好形势，革命委员会更加巩固。下面发表的是这个公社贫下中农、革命干部写的几篇革命大批判的文章。
    狠抓阶级斗争，发展大好形势
    长冈公社革命委员会主任　吴才枋
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。整个形势比以往任何时候都好。”我们长冈公社和全国一样，也是一片大好形势。
    在一片大好形势面前，我们革命委员会的全体成员认真地学习了毛主席的一系列最新指示，深刻地认识到：无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，越是复杂，越是深刻。在大好形势下，我们公社革命委员会遵照毛主席的教导，带领广大革命群众，活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，狠狠地打击妄图垂死挣扎的一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子。我们这样做，进一步发展了大好形势。现在，全公社活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动空前高涨，毛泽东思想空前大普及，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线越来越深入人心，革命大批判正在深入开展，广大贫下中农和基层干部的阶级斗争觉悟和路线斗争觉悟大大提高。狠抓革命大批判，促进了人的思想革命化，推动了生产，当前全公社的各项生产搞得热气腾腾。
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席的最新指示最深刻地阐明了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，最精辟地揭示了无产阶级文化大革命的阶级内容。我们一定遵照毛主席的教导，把这场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底，不获全胜，决不收兵。
