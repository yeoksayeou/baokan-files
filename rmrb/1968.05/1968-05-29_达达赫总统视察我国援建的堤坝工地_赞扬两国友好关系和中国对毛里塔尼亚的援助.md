Mauritania's President Moktar Ould Daddah visited the construction site of a dam in the Rosso region south of Nouakchott on May 24. He inspected the dam, which is being built with Chinese aid. At a welcoming ceremony held by local residents, Daddah praised the friendly relations between Mauritania and China and China's friendly aid to Mauritania.

Accompanied by the Chinese chargé d'affaires in Mauritania, Wei Yongqing, Daddah listened to a report on the overall project plan and the current progress. He shook hands warmly with the Chinese technicians working there and congratulated them on their close cooperation with Mauritania workers.

Those accompanying Daddah on his inspection included Mauritania's Interior Minister M. S. Ould Mokheytir and Planning and Rural Development Minister M. Ould Heiba.

According to the economic and technical cooperation agreement signed by the governments of Mauritania and China in Beijing in February 1967, the Chinese government sent technicians to help develop the Mboll plain in the lower reaches of the Senegal River in Mauritania. The dam under construction is about thirteen kilometers long and is the first phase of the project. Upon completion, it will prevent floods from affecting six thousand hectares of land during the Senegal River's high water season and will also allow a large part of this land to be irrigated during the dry season.

    达达赫总统视察我国援建的堤坝工地
    赞扬两国友好关系和中国对毛里塔尼亚的援助
    新华社努瓦克肖特二十七日电  毛里塔尼亚总统莫克塔·乌尔德·达达赫二十四日视察了位于努瓦克肖特以南的罗索地区，参观了正在那里由中国援助修建的一个堤坝的工地。达达赫总统在当地居民举行的欢迎会上讲话时，赞扬毛里塔尼亚和中国的友好关系，赞扬中国对毛里塔尼亚的友好援助。
    达达赫总统在中国驻毛里塔尼亚大使馆临时代办卫永清的陪同下参观堤坝工地时，听取了关于整个工程计划和目前进展情况的汇报。他同正在当地工作的中国技术人员亲切握手，并对他们同毛里塔尼亚工人亲密无间的合作表示祝贺。
    陪同达达赫总统视察的有毛里塔尼亚内政部长穆·萨·乌·穆凯提拉特、计划和农村发展部长莫·乌·海巴等。
    根据毛里塔尼亚政府和中国政府一九六七年二月在北京签订的经济技术合作协定，中国政府派出技术人员去帮助开发毛里塔尼亚位于塞内加尔河下游的姆波利平原。正在建设的堤坝长约十三公里，是工程的第一阶段，完工后可以使六千公顷的土地在塞内加尔河涨水时免遭水灾，并使其中大部分土地在旱季得到灌溉。
