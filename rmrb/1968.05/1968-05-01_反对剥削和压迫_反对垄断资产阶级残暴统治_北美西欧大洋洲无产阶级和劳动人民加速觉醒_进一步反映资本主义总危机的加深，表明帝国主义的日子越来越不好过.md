While the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are flourishing, the proletariat and working people of North America, Western Europe, and Oceania are also rapidly awakening. Their struggles against exploitation and oppression, and against the brutal rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie, are intensifying, striking heavy blows at the ruling cliques of the capitalist countries.

The United States' workers' strike struggles are raging fiercely. The main stronghold of imperialism, U.S. imperialism, has fallen into serious political and economic crises. The U.S. working class, with its glorious and long-standing tradition of struggle, has been waging a resolute struggle against the ruling clique's ferocious attacks to shift the financial and economic crisis onto their shoulders and against the ruthless exploitation of monopoly capital. In the past year, they have launched a fiery strike movement, reaching its highest peak since the end of the U.S. war in Korea in 1953. Currently, the U.S. working class's strike struggles, along with the black people's anti-violence struggles and the American people's struggle against the aggression in Vietnam, are like three mighty currents, increasingly striking at U.S. imperialism's reactionary rule at home.

In the past year, the scope of the U.S. workers' strike wave has been expanding, and the number of participants has been increasing. According to official U.S. figures, the number of strikers in the first half of last year was over 1.2 million, while in the second half it was around 1.7 million. Moreover, since the second half of last year, several nationwide strikes have broken out, some of which have lasted for several months. For example, the large-scale strike of copper miners and smelters that began in mid-July last year involved more than 60,000 people and lasted about nine months, bringing U.S. copper production to a near standstill. At the same time this large-scale strike broke out, 137,000 railroad mechanics held a nationwide strike, bringing more than 95% of U.S. rail transportation to a halt. Then, in September last year, 160,000 auto workers and teachers held large-scale strikes, the largest in U.S. history.

This year, the strike struggles have been continuous from the start, with some of the larger ones including: in January, more than 30,000 taxi drivers in New York went on strike; in February, 10,000 sanitation workers in New York and 32,000 glass workers in 23 states and 86 glass factories went on strike, as did about 90,000 coal miners. Recently, there was the first large-scale strike of more than 200,000 telecommunications workers in 21 years, affecting 42 states across the country.

The surging strike struggles have dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, which is already in dire straits both domestically and internationally. Strikes in the copper, rubber, shipbuilding, and rail transportation industries have all, to varying degrees, affected the production and supply of war materials for the Vietnam War and have brought new, heavy burdens to the already deeply troubled U.S. finances. It is estimated that the large-scale strike of copper miners alone has increased the U.S. trade deficit by $400 million.

The anxious and desperate U.S. reactionary ruling clique, increasingly unable to maintain the deceptive slogans of "freedom" and "democracy," has resorted to naked threats and suppression against the striking workers. However, this has only further educated and tempered the U.S. working class, further promoting their struggles. For example, striking workers often persist in their struggles despite the reactionary authorities' suppression and the pressure from yellow union leaders; thousands of workers at the Newport News Shipbuilding Company fought fiercely with police for two days; more than 25,000 workers in New York City held a rally to protest the Johnson government's reactionary orders to suppress the strike, and so on.

British workers strike heavily against the declining British Empire. With the further collapse and decline of the British colonial empire, the British ruling class is in its death throes, increasingly exploiting and oppressing the British working people. Currently, the number of unemployed in Britain is surging, prices are soaring, and taxes are increasing. The British ruling class's ruthless exploitation and oppression have sparked even stronger resistance from the British working people, especially the working class.

Over the past year, the British working class has launched various forms of strike struggles, one after another, without interruption. In particular, the strike of more than 16,000 British dock workers in September last year, against the Labour Party government's "dismissal of temporary workers" policy, paralyzed many docks in Liverpool and London, severely hitting Britain's import and export trade. During this strike, the British dock workers, despite the threats from the Labour Party government and the pressure from right-wing union leaders, tenaciously held out for more than two months. They also repeatedly fought bravely with police who tried to break the strike, demonstrating the power of the British working class.

Workers in the steel, automobile, and other industrial sectors, as well as railway workers, seamen, printers, and bank employees, have all conducted various forms of strike struggles since last year. During the dock workers' strike last year, railway workers also launched a large-scale strike, making the British ruling clique very uneasy, even threatening to use the military to suppress it.

Now, in dozens of large and small cities across Britain, the drivers of government-operated bus companies, who began a struggle for wage increases last October, are still continuing; three million machine workers are also fiercely resisting the British Labour Party government's "austerity policy" of attacking workers' living standards. They have demanded an immediate general wage increase, equal pay for equal work, and are fighting to achieve these demands against the capitalists.

To push the struggle forward, many British workers are striving to break free from the control of yellow unions and fight for the right to organize their own unions. In London, workers at a construction site last year fought for nearly a year to win the right to organize their own union and held a large-scale demonstration in October. The British government sent thousands of police to carry out bloody suppression and arrested a large number of demonstrators.

Facing the increasingly intense struggles of the British working people, the British monopoly bourgeoisie's newspapers anxiously predict that this summer, Britain will see an even larger wave of strikes.

French workers are increasingly rejecting revisionism. In France, due to stagnant production and the methods used by monopoly capitalists to merge enterprises and increase labor intensity, French workers are now under the serious threat of unemployment. According to statistics, France's current unemployment rate has reached 600,000 to 700,000, the highest since World War II. Even workers who are still lucky enough not to be unemployed are facing reduced incomes due to insufficient industrial operating hours and hourly wage calculations, while prices are continuously rising. According to statistics from L'Humanité, consumer prices in France rose by about 10% last year. This situation is making the lives of French working people increasingly difficult.

The French working class, with its tradition of struggle, is waging a resolute struggle. Last year, 500,000 workers in railways, gas, and electricity companies controlled by the French government, as well as Paris's subway and bus workers, held large-scale strikes. 170,000 miners also went on strike, demanding wage increases and opposing the ruthless exploitation of the monopoly bourgeoisie. In the automobile, shipbuilding, and metallurgical industries, workers' strike struggles are also on the rise. When capitalists attempt to lay off workers, workers unite and fight back, forcing capitalists to meet their demands.

It is worth noting that more and more French workers, through practical struggles, are gradually realizing the ugly face of the French revisionist clique in betraying the interests of the working class and pursuing a policy of class surrender. According to reports from L'Humanité, awakened French workers are increasingly rejecting the French revisionist clique and joining the French Marxist-Leninist Communist Party, which represents the interests of the French working class. In some enterprises, entire branches of the revisionist-controlled party have collectively declared their withdrawal from the revisionist clique. Many enterprise workers have also withdrawn from the revisionist-controlled general union and established their own fighting union organizations. These organizations have played a core role in the struggle against capitalists and have gained the

　　反对剥削和压迫　反对垄断资产阶级残暴统治
　　北美西欧大洋洲无产阶级和劳动人民加速觉醒
　　进一步反映资本主义总危机的加深，表明帝国主义的日子越来越不好过
    新华社二十八日讯  本社记者报道：在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的革命斗争蓬勃发展的同时，北美、西欧、大洋洲的无产阶级和劳动人民也在加速觉醒，他们反对剥削和压迫，反对垄断资产阶级残暴统治的斗争日益高涨，沉重地打击着资本主义世界各国的统治集团。
　　美国工人罢工斗争如火如荼
    帝国主义的主要堡垒——美帝国主义已经陷入严重的政治危机和经济危机之中。有着光荣、悠久的斗争传统的美国工人阶级，为了反对统治集团为转嫁财政经济危机而向他们发动的猖狂进攻，反对垄断资本的残酷压榨，一直在进行着坚决的斗争，在过去的一年中，他们开展了如火如荼的罢工运动，其声势和规模达到了一九五三年美帝侵朝战争结束以来的最高峰。目前，美国工人阶级的罢工斗争，同黑人抗暴斗争和美国人民反对侵略越南的斗争，象三股巨流，正在越来越有力地冲击着美帝国主义在国内的反动统治。
    一年来，美国工人罢工浪潮波及的范围越来越广，参加罢工斗争的人数也越来越多。据美国官方数字，去年上半年，参加罢工的人数是一百二十多万，而下半年是一百七十万左右；而且，从去年下半年开始，相继爆发了多起全国性罢工，其中有的坚持达几个月之久。例如，从去年七月中旬开始的铜矿及炼铜工人的大罢工，参加人数达六万多人，坚持了约九个月，使美国铜的生产几乎全部陷于停顿。就在爆发这次大罢工的同时，十三万七千多名铁路机械工人举行了全国性罢工，使美国百分之九十五以上的铁路运输陷于停顿。接着在去年九月份，又相继爆发了十六万名汽车制造工人的大罢工和美国历史上空前规模的教师大罢教。
    今年一开年，罢工斗争更是连绵不断，其中规模较大的有：一月间，纽约三万多名出租汽车司机罢工；二月间，纽约一万名清洁工人罢工，二十三个州、八十六家玻璃工厂的三万二千名玻璃工人罢工，以及约九万名煤矿工人的大罢工。最近，又爆发了二十一年来第一次的二十多万电讯工人的大罢工，罢工范围扩及全国的四十二个州。
    一浪高一浪的罢工斗争，给了已经陷于内外交困的美帝国主义以沉重的打击。铜矿、橡胶、造船、铁路运输等行业的工人罢工，都在不同程度上影响了侵越战争物资的生产和供应，并且还给已经陷于深重危机的美国财政带来了新的、沉重的负担。据估计，仅铜矿工人的大罢工就使美国的国际收支赤字扩大了四亿美元。
    惶惶不可终日的美国反动统治集团越来越顾不得“自由”、“民主”这些欺骗口号，而对罢工工人进行赤裸裸的威胁和镇压。但是，这又从反面教育和锻炼了美国的工人阶级，进一步促进了他们的斗争。例如，罢工工人经常不顾反动当局的镇压及黄色工会头子的压制而坚持斗争；“纽波特纽斯船舶修建公司”数千名工人接连两天同前往镇压的警察进行激烈搏斗；纽约市两万五千多名工人举行集会，抗议约翰逊政府镇压罢工的反动法令，等等。
    英国工人沉重打击衰落的英帝国
    随着英殖民帝国的进一步崩溃和衰落，英国统治阶级正在进行垂死挣扎，变本加厉地向英国劳动人民开刀。目前，英国的失业人数猛增，物价飞涨，苛捐杂税越来越多。英国统治阶级这种残酷的剥削和压榨，激起了英国广大劳动人民特别是工人阶级的更加强烈的反抗。
    一年多来，英国工人阶级进行的各种罢工斗争此伏彼起，连续不断。特别是一万六千多英国码头工人在去年九月为反对工党政府实行“解雇临时工”制度而举行的罢工，使利物浦和伦敦港的许多码头陷于瘫痪，严重地打击了英国的进出口贸易。在这次罢工中，英国码头工人不顾工党政府的威胁和右翼工会头目们的压力，顽强地坚持了两个多月。他们还不断同破坏罢工的警察进行英勇斗争，显示了英国工人阶级的力量。
    英国的钢铁、汽车等工业部门的工人、铁道工人、海员、印刷工人、银行雇员等去年以来都进行了各种形式的罢工斗争。就在去年码头工人罢工期间，铁道工人也发动了大罢工，使英国统治集团十分不安，它们甚至威胁要动用军队来镇压。
    现在，在英国全国几十个大小城市中，政府经营的公共汽车公司的司机，于去年十月开始的一场要求增加工资的斗争，还在继续；三百万机械工人也正在对英国工党政府向工人生活水平进攻的“紧缩政策”进行猛烈的反击，他们提出了立即普遍增加工资、男女同工同酬等要求，并且正在为实现这一要求同资本家进行斗争。
    为了把斗争进一步向前推进，不少英国工人正在努力摆脱黄色工会的控制，争取自己组织工会的权力。在伦敦，一个建筑工地的工人去年就曾为争取自行组织工会的权力而持续斗争了将近一年，并在去年十月间举行了大规模的示威。英国政府出动了成千名警察进行血腥镇压，并逮捕了大批示威者。
    面对着英国广大劳动人民日益高涨的斗争，英国垄断资产阶级的报纸忧心忡忡地预测说，今年夏季，英国将出现更大规模的罢工浪潮。
    法国工人纷纷唾弃修正主义
    在法国，由于生产停滞和垄断资本家采用合并企业、提高劳动强度等方法削减工人，加强剥削，法国工人现在处在失业的严重威胁之下。据统计，法国现在失业人数达到六、七十万，为第二次世界大战以来的最高峰。就是现在侥幸还没有失业的工人，由于工业开工时间不足，而工资又是按小时计算的，因此收入大为降低。与此同时，物价却不断上涨。据《新人道报》统计，去年法国的消费品价格上涨了约百分之十。这种情况使法国劳动人民的生活越来越困难。
    有着战斗传统的法国工人阶级正在展开坚决的斗争。去年，法国政府控制的铁路、煤气和电力等企业以及巴黎的地下铁道和公共汽车工人共五十万人举行了大规模罢工，十七万矿工也举行了罢工，要求提高工资，反对垄断资产阶级的残酷剥削。在汽车、造船、冶金等工业中，工人的罢工斗争也不断高涨。当资本家企图解雇工人时，工人们都团结一致，坚持斗争，迫使资本家答应工人的要求。
    需要指出的是，越来越多的法国工人，在实际斗争中逐渐认清了法国修正主义集团背叛工人阶级利益、推行阶级投降政策的丑恶面目。据《新人道报》报道，觉悟了的法国工人纷纷唾弃法修集团而加入代表法国工人阶级利益的法国马克思列宁主义共产党。在有些企业里，法修所属的整个支部集体宣布脱离法修集团。许多企业的工人还纷纷退出法修控制的总工会，而建立了自己的战斗工会组织。这些组织，在同资本家的斗争中发挥了核心作用，得到工人群众的信任和拥护。
    西德工人加速觉醒斗志昂扬
    在资本主义总危机加深，西德经济陷入严重困难的情况下，西德国内阶级矛盾正在进一步激化，西德工人阶级反对垄断资本转嫁困难、加紧剥削和压迫工人的群众斗争正在蓬勃展开。
    据西德官方公布的大大缩小的数字，一九六七年西德有七百四十二个工厂的工人举行了罢工。西德工业中心北来因—威斯特伐利亚州的建筑工人为反对削减工资而坚持罢工四十五天，是西德工人所举行的时间最长的一次罢工。鲁尔区的一万五千名矿工和他们的家属，为了反对资本家不断关闭矿井，解雇工人和实行强迫
  “歇班”，在多特蒙德举行了一次声势浩大的抗议示威，许多矿工打着红旗，高唱《国际歌》。工人们愤怒地喊出了富有战斗性的口号：“矿主靠边站，矿山矿工管！”这标志着西德工人阶级的加速觉醒，预示着西德工人的斗争将进一步高涨。
    值得注意的是，西德工人的斗争正开始同不断高涨的学生运动相结合。今年一、二月间，在遍及西德全国各地的反对公共交通收费增加的抗议斗争中，许多青年工人和青年学生都联合战斗。三月初，科隆市一千多名福特汽车厂工人和科隆大学的学生联合举行群众大会，抗议资本家强迫工人“歇班”，向工人转嫁困难。这次工人和学生联合举行的大会，也是西德历史上的第一次。有的工人在发言中说：“我们不仅要针对福特厂的垄断资本家，而且要针对整个资本主义制度。”
    其他国家工人斗争一浪高一浪
    在其他许多资本主义国家，工人阶级反对垄断资本残酷剥削的斗争也一浪高过一浪。在意大利，去年四十万纺织工人曾六次举行全国性罢工，三十五万木材加工工人五次举行全国性罢工，要求增加工资。在比利时，工人们为了反对资本家解雇工人，曾占领工厂，同前去镇压的警察进行搏斗。甚至在佛朗哥独裁政权统治下的西班牙，尽管政府命令禁止罢工和自由组织工会，工人们仍然不顾政府禁令，不断举行罢工，并且在去年十月二十七日，举行了全国性斗争日。工人不仅提出了增加工资等经济要求，而且还提出了推翻佛朗哥法西斯政权的口号。澳大利亚和新西兰的工人斗争，近年来也在不断发展，不断取得胜利。
    西方资本主义国家的工人和其他劳动人民的加速觉醒，进一步反映了世界资本主义总危机的加深，表明帝国主义的日子越来越不好过。正如无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席指出：“欧洲、北美和大洋洲的无产阶级和劳动人民，正处在新的觉醒之中。美帝国主义和其他一切害人虫已经准备好了自己的掘墓人，他们被埋葬的日子不会太长了。”
