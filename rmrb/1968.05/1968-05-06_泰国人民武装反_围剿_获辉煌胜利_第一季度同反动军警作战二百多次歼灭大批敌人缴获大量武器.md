Thai People's Armed Forces Achieve Brilliant Victory in Anti-"Encirclement" Campaign
Over 200 Battles Fought in First Quarter, Eliminating Large Numbers of Enemy Forces and Seizing Large Quantities of Weapons

New China News Agency, May 3rd

According to "The Voice of the Thai People" radio broadcast, preliminary statistics show that the people's armed forces led by the Communist Party of Thailand fought 230 battles against the reactionary military and police of the U.S.-Thanom clique in the northeastern, southern, central, and northern regions during the first quarter of this year. They eliminated approximately 300 enemy soldiers, including 30 officers, officials, and policemen, and successfully thwarted the enemy's dry-season "encirclement" campaign. The people's armed forces also seized a large quantity of weapons and shot down or damaged several helicopters.

The radio station reported that in early April, the people's armed forces in various regions continued to ambush and intercept the enemy, attacking enemy outposts in many counties. The people's armed forces in Nakhon Phanom, Chiang Rai, and Surat Thani provinces also went to villages to propagate among the masses and eliminate spies.

The rapid development of the people's armed forces has caused the U.S.-Thanom clique to be in a state of panic. The puppet deputy prime minister, Praphas Charusathien, fled to the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan to conspire with the American lackeys in these places, aiming to form a new military alliance to replace the dying Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Recently, the Thanom-Praphas clique has decided to cancel the summer vacations for government officials at all levels to cope with the "tension" caused by the growth and development of the people's armed forces.

New China News Agency, Bangkok News:

The Thai people's armed forces have recently been more frequently taking the initiative to attack, eliminating over 30 reactionary military and police personnel and achieving new victories.

According to a report from "The Voice of the Thai People" radio station, following the brave destruction of the Thanom reactionary clique's border police station in Chiang Khong District, Chiang Rai Province, by the Hmong people's armed forces under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand on April 18th, the people's armed forces in Thung Chang District, Nakhon Si Thammarat Province, bravely attacked an enemy camp and cleverly ambushed reactionary military and police personnel sent to suppress the people, eliminating 12 enemy soldiers. The radio station said that from April 17th to 23rd, the Thai people's armed forces launched widespread attacks in Nakhon Phanom, Sakhon Nakhon, Ubon Ratchathani, Chaiyaphum, Phitsanulok, Nakhon Si Thammarat, and other provinces.

"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station recently called on the Thai people to respond to Chairman Mao's battle call with practical actions, launching a fierce attack on American imperialism and the Thanom traitorous clique. The radio station emphasized that the Thai people deeply understand that only by daring to use revolutionary violence to resolutely resist counter-revolutionary violence can true revolutionary victories be achieved. Therefore, the Thai people actively respond to the call of the Communist Party of Thailand, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, determined to carry the armed struggle to the end and contribute to the world revolution.

According to a recent broadcast by "The Voice of the Thai People" radio station, the Hmong people's armed forces in Chiang Khong District, Chiang Rai Province, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, bravely destroyed the Thanom-Praphas traitorous clique's border police station in Chiang Khong District in the early hours of April 18th, eliminating 15 enemy personnel and seizing a radio station and a batch of weapons.

　　泰国人民武装反“围剿”获辉煌胜利
　　第一季度同反动军警作战二百多次歼灭大批敌人缴获大量武器
    新华社三日讯　据“泰国人民之声”电台广播，据不完全统计，泰国共产党领导的人民武装，今年第一季度在东北部、南部、中部及北部地区，同美国—他侬集团的反动军警作战二百三十次，歼灭敌军约三百人，胜利粉碎了敌人的旱季“围剿”。电台说，被歼敌人中，包括各级军官、警官和政府官员三十人。人民武装还缴获大批武器，击落击伤数架直升飞机。
    电台说，四月初，各地人民武装继续在许多县伏击、截击敌人，攻击敌人哨所。那空拍侬府、清莱府和素叻他尼府等地区人民武装还到村庄里去向群众进行宣传和清除特务。
    人民武装的大规模发展使得美国—他侬集团胆战心惊。傀儡副总理巴博·乍鲁沙天跑到菲律宾、日本、南朝鲜和台湾，勾结这些地方的美国走狗，以拼凑新的军事联盟来取代垂死的东南亚条约组织集团。
    最近，他侬—巴博集团已经决定，取消政府各级官员的暑假，以便应付由于人民武装力量的壮大和发展所造成的“紧张局势”。
    新华社讯　曼谷消息：泰国人民武装最近更加频繁地主动出击，歼灭反动军警三十多人，取得新战果。
    据“泰国人民之声”电台报道，继泰国共产党领导下的北部清莱府清孔县苗族人民武装，在四月十八日英勇捣毁他侬反动集团驻清孔县一个区的边防警察署之后，难府童仓县人民武装曾英勇地袭击敌人的军营，并机智地伏击前往镇压人民的反动军警，歼灭敌人十二名。电台说，从四月十七日到二十三日的一周内，泰国人民武装还在那空拍侬、沙空那空、乌隆、程逸、博他仑、那空是贪玛叻等府广泛出击。
    “泰国人民之声”电台最近号召泰国人民用实际行动响应毛主席的战斗号召，向着美帝国主义和他侬卖国集团发动猛烈的进攻。这家电台强调指出，泰国人民深深懂得，只有敢于用革命的暴力坚决抗击反革命的暴力，才能取得革命的真正胜利。因此，泰国人民积极响应泰国共产党的号召，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，决心把武装斗争进行到底，为世界革命作出贡献。
    新华社讯　据“泰国人民之声”电台不久前广播，泰国共产党领导下的泰国北部清莱府清孔县苗族人民武装，在四月十八日凌晨，英勇地捣毁了他侬—巴博卖国集团驻清孔县一个区的边防警察署，共消灭敌人十五人，并缴获一座电台和一批武器。
