According to a report by Swedish newspapers, more than twenty thousand Danish workers demonstrated in Copenhagen on the 24th, protesting against the Danish government's persecution of striking workers.

The demonstrators gathered outside the Danish Parliament building, which was in session, shouting slogans demanding the resignation of the current Danish government and an end to the persecution of striking workers. Hundreds of sailors and wireless operators in Copenhagen harbor have been on strike since May 8, demanding reforms to the unreasonable wage system and wage increases. This strike has caused more than forty ships to be stranded in Copenhagen harbor, unable to set sail.

In addition, on May 17, hundreds of telephone technicians also went on strike, rendering thousands of telephones in Copenhagen unusable.

The Danish government convened a parliamentary session and passed a resolution attempting to force the striking workers back to work. This arrogant move has not only met with strong opposition from the broad masses of workers but has also caused dissatisfaction among other social strata.

According to a report by the New China News Agency on the 25th, approximately twenty thousand Dutch workers held a demonstration on the 25th, protesting against the government's wage policy that attacks the living standards of the working people.

The protesting workers at a protest rally held in the important industrial and transportation hub city of Utrecht in the Netherlands expressed strong opposition to the government's attempt to freeze workers' wages at the 1968 level within 1969. A worker representative speaking at the meeting pointed out that due to the continuous rise in prices, freezing wages means reducing workers' real wages.

    丹麦荷兰数万名工人大示威
    丹麦工人罢工使四十多艘船只停航，数千台电话机无法使用
    新华社斯德哥尔摩二十五日电　据瑞典报纸报道，丹麦工人两万多人二十四日在哥本哈根举行示威，抗议丹麦政府迫害罢工工人。
    示威工人在正在开会的丹麦议会的大厦外面高呼口号，要求丹麦现政府辞职，并停止对罢工工人的迫害。哥本哈根港口的数百名海员和无线电报务员从五月八日开始罢工，要求改革不合理的工资制度和增加工资。这次罢工使四十多艘船只停在哥本哈根港口无法开航。
    此外，五月十七日，电话技术人员数百人也举行了罢工，使哥本哈根的数千台电话机无法使用。
    丹麦政府为此召开议会会议，并通过决议，企图强迫罢工工人复工。这一蛮横作法不仅遭到了广大工人群众的强烈反对，而且也引起了其他社会阶层居民的不满。
    新华社二十五日讯  阿姆斯特丹消息：约两万名荷兰工人二十五日举行示威，抗议政府进攻劳动人民生活水平的工资政策。
    示威工人在荷兰的重要工业、交通中心城市乌得勒支市举行的抗议大会上，表示强烈反对政府要在一九六九年内，把工人工资冻结在一九六八年水平的企图。在会上发言的工人代表指出，由于物价不断上涨，冻结工资就意味着削减工人实际工资。
