Five thousand Italian students held a demonstration in Rome on the 27th, strongly protesting the Italian government's suppression of the Italian student movement with the support of U.S. imperialism. The demonstrators engaged in fierce clashes with the police who came to suppress them. This was the third time in the past two months that Italian students in Rome have fought with the police in the streets.

The student demonstration was to demand the release of two student leaders who were illegally arrested by the government a few days earlier during a demonstration against U.S. aggression in Vietnam. The students carried the flags of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, chanting slogans such as "Yankees go home!" and "Do not suppress the students!" as they marched in formation through the streets of Rome. When they reached the Supreme Court, they were attacked by about a thousand police officers wearing steel helmets. The students then overturned cars and set up barriers on the streets, using sticks and stones to counterattack. The fighting between the students and the police disrupted traffic in the area for several hours.

A group of students also held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy. The slogans on their placards read: "Drive the Yankees out!" and "No colonialism here!" The students also held a demonstration in front of the main propaganda tool of the Italian ruling class, the *Messaggero*, protesting the newspaper's deception of the public. The students chanted slogans: "Down with the capitalist press!"

　　意大利五千学生在罗马举行示威
    新华社二十八日讯  罗马消息：五千名意大利学生二十七日在罗马举行示威，强烈抗议意大利政府在美帝支持下镇压意大利的学生运动。示威者同前去镇压的警察展开激烈搏斗。这是最近两个月来意大利学生在罗马第三次同警察进行街头搏斗。
    学生示威是为了要求释放前几天在一次反对美帝侵略越南的示威中被政府非法逮捕的二名学生领导人。示威学生举着越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜，高呼“美国佬滚回家”“不准镇压学生”等口号，在罗马的大街上列队游行。他们游行到最高法院外面时，受到一千名左右头戴钢盔的警察的袭击，学生们便推翻汽车，在街道上设置障碍物，用棍棒和石块进行反击。学生和警察的搏斗使附近的交通断绝了好几个小时。
    一批学生还在美国大使馆前举行示威。学生们拿着的标语牌上写着：“把美国佬赶出去！”“这里不得有美国的殖民地！”学生们也在意大利统治集团主要宣传工具《信使报》门前举行示威，抗议《信使报》欺骗群众。学生们高呼口号：“打倒资本家的报刊”。
