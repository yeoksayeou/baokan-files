More than a thousand black residents in Salisbury, Maryland, took to the streets in two consecutive nights of fierce resistance against police brutality on May 18th and 19th. This marks another significant uprising following the massive black protests that swept the nation in early April.

On May 18th, Salisbury police shot and killed a black youth without provocation, sparking outrage among the local black community. Salisbury is a small town with a population of just 18,000, of which approximately one-third are black. Over a thousand black residents quickly gathered in front of the police station to demand justice for the slain youth. The reactionary authorities, terrified by the black resistance, immediately declared a state of emergency. Governor Agnew ordered the deployment of 800 National Guardsmen and 300 state police, and put the state's 6,000 National Guardsmen on alert in an attempt to suppress the black uprising.

However, the brave black residents remained undeterred. They fearlessly confronted the police, who responded with tear gas, resulting in intense clashes. Reports indicate that the black residents also broke into a gun shop and seized a large quantity of firearms and ammunition.

On the night of May 19th, the brave black residents continued their resistance, hurling stones and bricks at the fascist police. Black snipers also opened fire on police cars in retaliation.

    美国索尔兹伯里市黑人掀起抗暴斗争
    千余黑人群众英勇不屈同警察展开激烈搏斗，狙击手向警车开枪还击
    新华社二十一日讯  华盛顿消息：美国东海岸马里兰州索尔兹伯里市一千余名黑人，在十八日、十九日，连续两夜奋起抗暴。这是今年四月初美国黑人空前大规模抗暴斗争高潮后，再次出现的较大规模的黑人抗暴斗争。
    十八日，索尔兹伯里市的警察无故地枪杀了一名黑人青年，引起了当地黑人的极大愤慨。索尔兹伯里是一个人口仅一万八千的市镇，其中黑人约占三分之一，当时就有一千余名黑人立即从四面八方涌到市警察局门前示威，要求严惩凶手。被黑人斗争吓得要死的反动当局，立即进行疯狂的镇压，州长阿格纽下令宣布紧急状态，调去了八百名国民警卫队和三百名州的警察，并让这个州的六千名国民警卫队处于警戒状态，妄图扑灭这个市的黑人抗暴斗争。
    但是，英勇不屈的黑人毫不动摇，他们冒着警察施放的催泪瓦斯，和警察展开了激烈的搏斗。据报道，他们还打开了一家军火商店，夺取了大批枪枝弹药。
    十九日晚，英勇的黑人继续用石块和砖头抗击着残暴的法西斯警察，黑人狙击手还向警车开枪还击。
