Albanian Representative Strongly Condemns the U.S.-Soviet "Non-Proliferation" Deception in the United Nations
The World's Revolutionary People Will Defeat the U.S.-Soviet Counterrevolutionary Conspiracy
China's Nuclear Achievements Break the U.S.-Soviet Nuclear Monopoly and Are Cheered by Progressive Humanity

BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- According to a report by the Albanian News Agency, on May 3, the head of the Albanian delegation, Budho, strongly condemned the U.S.-Soviet draft treaty on the "prevention of nuclear proliferation" in the United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee. He pointed out that this nuclear military alliance between the U.S. and the Soviet Union is aimed at China and the world's revolutionary people.

Budho said that the draft treaty proposed by the U.S. and the Soviet Union is not a disarmament measure at all. It does not touch the existing nuclear weapons stockpiles, does not include provisions to ban the use and production of nuclear weapons, and does not impose any restrictions on the U.S. nuclear bases around the world or the nuclear-armed submarines and aircraft deployed by the U.S. in various parts of the world. On the contrary, the provisions explicitly legalize the remaining nuclear monopoly of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, strengthening their privileged position in this regard over other non-nuclear countries. Like the "Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty," the current treaty allows the treaty drafters to continue the nuclear arms race, further develop nuclear weapons, and continue nuclear threats according to their plans to dominate the world. They attempt to place non-nuclear countries under their control, using nuclear weapons as a means to threaten and blackmail the revolutionary people of various countries.

Budho pointed out that the main target of the treaty drafters, as it was during the signing of the "Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty," has always been the People's Republic of China. This is because the People's Republic of China is the main obstacle to their counterrevolutionary and neo-colonialist plans.

Budho said that the imperialist and traitorous leadership of the U.S. and the Soviet Union have been trying in every way to prevent China from having nuclear weapons. Despite this, as everyone knows, the People's Republic of China has foiled these conspiracies. It has permanently broken the nuclear monopoly of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and thus has been greeted with extremely enthusiastic cheers from all progressive humanity. People around the world enthusiastically applaud China's brilliant achievements in this field of science and technology, because this not only serves the defensive interests of the great Chinese people but also has great historical significance for the world movement of various countries' people in their struggle for national and social liberation, against imperialism and its accomplices' war and aggression plans. The enthusiastic cheers of the people of all countries in the world show their trust in the People's Republic of China—the invincible fortress of the revolutionary cause of the people of all countries.

Budho said that the U.S.-Soviet draft of so-called "security guarantees" or so-called "nuclear umbrella" is also primarily aimed at the People's Republic of China. This is a new agreement of the U.S.-Soviet nuclear military alliance aimed at the People's Republic of China and all countries and peoples who love freedom and independence.

After condemning the U.S. aggression against the Vietnamese people and the conspiracies of imperialism and Israel against the Arab countries, Budho pointed out that in these vicious and bloody activities directed against the people of various countries, the U.S. now has the Soviet revisionist leadership as its main partner. It has formed a new "Holy Alliance" with the Soviet revisionist leadership, aiming to suppress the national and social liberation movements of the people of various countries and strangle the struggle of peace-loving countries to maintain national independence and state sovereignty. After the Glassboro talks, the counterrevolutionary grand conspiracy of the two superpowers, the U.S. and the Soviet Union, to dominate the world, has entered a new phase in jointly drafting new plans and new conspiracies against the people of various countries, against Vietnam, against the People's Republic of China, against the countries of the Middle East, and against other countries in various regions of the world. Facing the savage acts of aggression and oppression by imperialism and colonialism led by the U.S., facing the grand conspiracy of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, the people of various countries are launching increasingly powerful attacks around the world, strengthening their liberation struggles, making the enemy suffer various defeats, and advancing with firm steps and unshakable confidence on the road to victory in their just cause.

Budho emphasized that the People's Republic of Albania has always advocated and will continue to advocate the complete and thorough prohibition of the use and production of nuclear weapons, and the complete destruction of existing nuclear weapons stockpiles. However, the current treaty draft of the U.S. and the Soviet Union has nothing to do with this lofty goal. Signing such a treaty would help the global conspiracy of the U.S. and the Soviet Union against the people of various countries. We hope that peace-loving countries can thwart this dangerous plan and reject this draft that is incompatible with their vital interests, national sovereignty, and the cause of freedom and security of the people of various countries.

Currently, the United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee is discussing the draft treaty on the "prevention of nuclear proliferation" jointly concocted by the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

    阿尔巴尼亚代表在联合国严正谴责美苏所谓“防止核扩散”骗局
    世界革命人民定将挫败美苏反革命阴谋
    中国核武器光辉成就打破美苏核垄断受到进步人类欢呼
    据新华社十日讯　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道，阿尔巴尼亚代表团团长布多五月三日在联合国大会政治委员会上，强烈谴责美苏所谓“防止核扩散”条约草案的阴谋，指出美苏这种核军事同盟旨在反对中国和世界革命人民。
    布多说，美苏拟议中的条约草案，决不是什么裁军措施，它完全没有触及现存的核武器储备，没有条款规定禁止使用和生产核武器，也没有对美国 在世界各地的核基地以及美国派往世界各地的配备核武器的潜水艇和飞机规定任何限制。相反，其中条款明确地使美苏两国在原子武器方面的残余垄断合法化，加强了两国对其他无核国家在这方面的特权地位。同“部分禁止核试验条约”一样，目前的条约准许条约制订者继续进行核军备竞赛，进一步发展核武器，根据它们主宰世界的计划继续进行核威胁。它们力图把无核国家置于自己的控制之下，用核武器作为对各国革命人民进行威胁和讹诈的手段。
    布多指出，条约制订者的主要目标，象在缔结
  “部分禁止核试验条约”时一样，始终是中华人民共和国，因为中华人民共和国是它们实现反革命和新殖民主义计划的主要障碍。
    布多说，美帝国主义和苏联叛徒领导集团一直千方百计地企图阻止中国拥有核武器。尽管这样，正如大家所知道的，中华人民共和国已经挫败了这些阴谋，她已经永远破除了美苏两国的核武器垄断，从而受到整个进步人类极其热烈的欢呼。全世界各国人民热烈欢呼中国科学技术在这方面所取得的辉煌成就，因为这不仅符合伟大中国人民的防务利益，而且对各国人民争取民族和社会解放，反对帝国主义及其帮凶的战争与侵略计划的世界运动也具有伟大的历史意义。全世界各国人民的这种热烈的欢呼，表明了他们对中华人民共和国——世界各国人民的革命事业的不可战胜的堡垒——的信任。
    布多说，美苏所谓“安全保证”或所谓“核保护伞”的草案，其矛头也主要是指向中华人民共和国。这是针对中华人民共和国以及爱好自由和独立的所有国家和各国人民的美苏核军事同盟的一项新协议。
    布多在谴责美国对越南人民的侵略以及帝国主义和以色列对阿拉伯国家推行的阴谋之后指出，在矛头指向各国人民的这种凶恶和血腥的活动中，美国现在以苏修领导集团作为主要伙伴，它同苏修领导集团缔结了一个新的
  “神圣同盟”，其目的在于镇压各国人民的民族和社会解放运动，扼杀爱好和平的国家维护民族独立和国家主权的斗争。在葛拉斯堡罗会谈以后，美苏两大国主宰世界的反革命大阴谋，在联合制订反对各国人民、反对越南、反对中华人民共和国、反对中近东国家和反对世界各地区其他国家的新计划和新阴谋方面，进入了一个新阶段。面对以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义的侵略和压迫的野蛮行径，面对美苏的大阴谋，各国人民正在世界各地越来越强有力地发动进攻，加强他们的解放斗争，使敌人遭到种种失败，并且以坚定的步伐，怀着毫不动摇的信心，在自己正义事业胜利的道路上奋勇前进。
    布多强调说，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国不论过去和现在，都主张全面彻底地禁止使用和生产核武器，主张完全销毁现存的核武器储备。但是，美苏目前的条约草案同这一崇高目标毫不相干。在这种条约上签字就会给反对各国人民的美苏全球阴谋帮忙。我们希望，爱好和平的国家能够挫败这一危险的计划，拒绝这种同它们的切身利益和国家主权以及各国人民的自由与安全的事业不相容的草案。
    目前，联合国大会政治委员会正在讨论美苏合伙炮制的“防止核扩散”条约草案。
