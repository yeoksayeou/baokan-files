The majestic melody of "The East Is Red" echoed across Tiananmen Square. Millions of hearts beat excitedly in rhythm with the music. At nine o'clock in the evening, our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, along with his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin and other central leaders, arrived at Tiananmen Gate. Chairman Mao, radiant and glowing, warmly greeted the leaders from various sectors, the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, democratic personages, and scientists on the gate. The passion of millions of revolutionary masses condensed into the world's finest language: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years! We wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

Colorful fireworks soared into the sky, casting a dazzling glow that illuminated Beijing. These were fireworks of revolution, of struggle, of victory. They symbolized the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and seemed to represent the blooming hearts of the revolutionary masses.

At around four in the afternoon, 500,000 revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary cadres, and Red Guards, filled with revolutionary fervor, held up colorful portraits of our great teacher Chairman Mao, sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, and marched in unison from all directions towards Tiananmen Square and East and West Chang'an Streets.

Under the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad laboring people of the capital sang and danced, celebrating their day of unity and struggle, and cheering the brilliant achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years. They studied and discussed the editorials in the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily celebrating May Day, and resolved to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and march forward to victory.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! It is your brilliant thoughts that have brought about this unprecedented excellent situation. When you inspected the North China, Central China, and East China regions last year, you wisely pointed out: "The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide is excellent, not just good," "In a few more months, the overall situation will become even better." Reality has proven your great foresight.

Since you issued the great directive to "hold study classes, which is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes has become the top priority in the political life of the people nationwide, powerfully promoting revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Most provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have successively established revolutionary committees. Hundreds of millions of people, with "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key link and "the three old articles" as their motto, actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen proletarian party spirit, oppose bourgeois factionalism, and have undergone tremendous changes in their spiritual outlook. This not only greatly promoted the revolution but also powerfully boosted production. The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Micro Motor Factory, sitting by the Golden Water Bridge near Tiananmen, looked up at Tiananmen Gate and saw the great leader Chairman Mao, feeling particularly excited. After learning from the advanced experience of the Beijing Knitting Factory, the workers of this factory grasped the root of everything, placing the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work, promoting the thought revolution of the people. From January to April this year, the entire factory continuously overfulfilled the production plan.

The proletarian revolutionary masses of the Beijing Machinery Factory, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, worked hard to promote revolutionary great unity, uniting the broad masses. The entire factory united as one, fiercely fighting the class enemy, exposing the black hands that sabotaged the revolutionary great unity, and boosting the fighting spirit of all workers. The production in the first four months of this year increased by 42% compared to the same period last year. Tonight, seeing the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, they were all excited, holding up red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and vowing: We must carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, be humble and modest, and strive for greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You deeply instructed us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Your brilliant directive is a powerful ideological weapon for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. We must resolutely oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, smashing the rightist reversal wind; we must direct the spearhead of struggle firmly at a handful of class enemies, persistently carry out revolutionary big-character posters, and expose all hidden traitors, spies, and all counterrevolutionaries.

The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Fifth Construction Company, sitting south of the Golden Water Bridge, continuously shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao!" It was Chairman Mao's wise instructions that enlightened their eyes. After the revolutionary committee of this company was established, the class enemies, unwilling to admit defeat, directed their spears at the newly born revolutionary committee and the People's Liberation Army. They adopted despicable two-faced tactics, first attempting to infiltrate the mass organizations and enter the revolutionary committee. When this evil purpose could not be achieved, they vigorously created counterrevolutionary public opinion and posted counterrevolutionary slogans, attempting to overthrow the revolutionary committee. Just at this time, Chairman Mao issued the latest directive. The revolutionary committee then firmly grasped class struggle, leading the broad revolutionary masses to attack the class enemies, exposing a handful of traitors, spies, and counterrevolutionaries. The broad revolutionary workers, through these shocking class struggle teaching materials, more deeply understood Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle." They not only deeply hated these counterrevolutionary elements but also deeply hated the black backers of these counterrevolutionary elements, China's Khrushchev. They all stood up to fiercely criticize China's Khrushchev's theory of "class struggle extinction" and his reactionary party-building line.

The Beijing Stamp Factory was one of the earliest factories to establish a revolutionary committee, with both revolution and production going well, frequently receiving praise from outside units. Some workers thought: "The class enemies have been finished, and our factory is now calm." The fact was not so. A capitalist roader, outwardly appearing very "honest," secretly colluded with the bad elements inside and outside the factory, maintaining secret contacts. From the second half of last year, he raised the banner of "opposing the ultra-leftist trend" and counterattacked the revolutionary masses of the proletariat from the right. This capitalist roader, under the guise of "home visits" and "admitting mistakes and opening the heart," visited more than eighty households of workers, creating a reversal atmosphere among the masses. He also kept a large number of accounts for changing the sky. Under the enlightenment of Chairman Mao's latest directive, the revolutionary masses of this factory raised their awareness, sharpened their eyes, seized his fox's tail, and exposed his counterrevolutionary two-faced nature.

The proletarian revolutionary masses of the Beijing Comprehensive Instrument Factory came to celebrate the festival with joy in struggle. To welcome May Day, all workers of the factory, with Chairman Mao's latest directive as the guideline, firmly grasped class struggle and continuously and deeply carried out revolutionary big-character posters, welcoming an excellent situation. A handful of capitalist roaders within the party, traitors, spies, and counterrevolutionaries who infiltrated the party, fell into the vast sea of "people's war." Before coming to Tiananmen to celebrate the festival today, all workers and family members of the factory, with strong class hatred, carried out criticism and struggle against a handful of capitalist roaders within the party.

On Tiananmen Square, the ranks of the People's Liberation Army were orderly and majestic. They are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to the party, forever loyal to the people, and a steel wall.

Great leader Chairman Mao! You issued the great call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad leftist masses, and our People's Liberation Army shouldered the glorious tasks of "three supports and two militaries" in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, establishing new great merits.

In the revolutionary committees, military representatives brought revolutionary traditions, promoting the thought revolution of the committee members. The military representative of the Pinggu County Revolutionary Committee has always regarded learning, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest directive as his highest duty. Recently, they, according to Chairman Mao's latest directive and the current class struggle situation in the county, helped the revolutionary committee further carry out revolutionary big-character posters throughout the county, investigating the behind-the-scenes activities of capitalist roaders, spies, and the destructive activities of landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists.

After the revolutionary committee of the Beijing Half-Work Half-Study Materials Management School was established, some people did not see class struggle in the midst of victory and thought: "The big rivers have been crossed, can small streams still capsize the boat?" However, just when the school revolutionary committee was focusing on resuming classes and making revolution, the class enemies jumped out, spreading evil winds and lighting ghost fires, attempting to sabotage the resumption of classes and making revolution. These phenomena caught the attention of the supporting-left soldiers stationed at the school. They immediately organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," launching an attack on the class enemies, making the resumption of classes and making revolution in the entire school develop healthily.

Some officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Beijing Air Force, participating in the evening event, enthusiastically discussed the excellent situation of class struggle at home and abroad. Active learner of Chairman Mao's works and deputy political commissar of a certain unit, Chen Shuyao, excitedly said: "Chairman Mao's declaration supporting the violent struggle of American blacks is a new call to arms for the anti-American struggle of the world. Chairman Mao's latest directive has made the most profound summary of the great significance and class content of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and is a new mobilization order for class struggle at home. The enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day."

These air force officers and soldiers solemnly vowed: "Beloved Chairman Mao! The People's Air Force you personally cultivated will definitely follow your words, being both a promoter of domestic revolution and a promoter of international revolution, using the 'loyalty' forged in blood to build a steel wall to defend you! Defending you is defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, defending the fundamental interests of the laboring people!" This solemn vow from the heart represents the voice of the broad officers and soldiers of the entire army.

"Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." The people of the capital love the People's Liberation Army the most and support it the most. "Believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army" is an important part of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Many revolutionary masses said: "The more the class enemies oppose the People's Liberation Army, the more we must learn from the People's Liberation Army." Tonight, on Tiananmen Square, the military and the people celebrated May Day together, with the military loving the people and the people supporting the military, in a close and intimate relationship, singing and cheering "Long live Chairman Mao" together, truly "unity between the military and the people."

The night was deep, but Beijing was still immersed in the joy of the festival. The initial summer night sky was adorned with beautiful and magnificent patterns formed by dozens of searchlights. Tiananmen Square echoed with the majestic song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

The proletarian revolutionary masses and laboring people of the capital, after celebrating May Day with the great teacher Chairman Mao, will march forward more bravely, welcoming greater struggles and the all-around victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　紧跟毛主席乘胜前进
　　——记首都军民欢庆“五一”国际劳动节之夜
    雄壮的《东方红》乐曲响彻天安门广场。千万颗红心随着乐曲的旋律兴奋地跳动。晚上九点，我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席以及中央其他负责同志，来到了天安门城楼。毛主席神采奕奕，满面红光，同在城楼上的各方面负责同志、人民解放军指战员、民主人士和科学家一个一个地亲切见面。亿万革命群众的激情凝结成了世界上最好的语言：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    五彩缤纷的礼花腾空而起，发射出耀眼的光芒，映红了北京城。这是革命的礼花，战斗的礼花，胜利的礼花。它象征着无产阶级文化大革命的一派大好形势，又好似无产阶级革命派的心花怒放。
    下午四点多钟，五十万革命工人、贫下中农、解放军指战员、革命干部和红卫兵小将，就满怀革命激情，高举着伟大导师毛主席的彩色画像，唱着毛主席语录歌，跨着整齐的步伐，从四面八方涌向天安门广场和东西长安街。
    在无产阶级文化大革命一片大好形势下，首都的无产阶级革命派和广大劳动人民，载歌载舞，欢庆自己团结战斗的节日，欢呼两年来无产阶级文化大革命取得的辉煌成就。他们学习和讨论了《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》庆祝“五一”国际劳动节的社论，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，乘胜前进。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！是您的光辉思想带来了一派空前的大好形势。您在去年视察华北、中南和华东地区时就英明地指出：“全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好”，“再有几个月的时间，整个形势将会变得更好。”现实证明了您的伟大预见。
    自从您发出“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的伟大教导以后，大办毛泽东思想学习班便成为全国人民政治生活中的头等大事，有力地推动了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。全国大多数省、市、自治区，已经相继建立了革命委员会。亿万人民群众以“斗私，批修”为纲，以“老三篇”为座右铭，活学活用毛泽东思想，增强无产阶级党性，反对资产阶级派性，人们的精神面貌发生了巨大的变化。不但大大促进了革命，而且有力地带动了生产。坐在紧靠天安门金水桥畔的北京微电机厂的革命职工，仰望着天安门城楼，看到了伟大领袖毛主席，心情特别激动。这个厂的革命职工学习了北京针织总厂的先进经验以后，工作千条万绪狠抓根本，把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，促进了人的思想革命化。今年一月到四月，全厂连续超额完成了生产计划。
    北京人民机器厂的无产阶级革命派，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，努力促进革命的大联合，团结了广大群众，全厂上下拧成一股绳，狠斗阶级敌人，揪出了破坏革命大联合的黑手，振奋了全体职工的斗志，革命和生产出现了一派大好形势。今年一至四月份的产量，比去年同期增长了百分之四十二。今晚，他们见到了最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，个个激动地高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》宣誓：一定要发扬无产阶级彻底革命精神，戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您深刻地指示我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”您的这一光辉指示，是无产阶级革命派的强大思想武器。我们要坚决反对右倾机会主义，右倾分裂主义，右倾投降主义，粉碎右倾翻案风；我们要把斗争的矛头紧紧对准一小撮阶级敌人，持久地开展革命的大批判，把隐藏的叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子统统挖出来。
    坐在金水桥南的北京第五建筑公司革命工人，不停地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”正是毛主席的英明指示，擦亮了他们的眼睛。这个公司的革命委员会建立以后，阶级敌人不甘心失败，把矛头指向新生的革命委员会，指向人民解放军。他们采取卑鄙的两面手法，首先企图打进群众组织，混入革命委员会，当这一罪恶目的不能得逞时，就大力制造反革命舆论，张贴反革命标语，妄图搞垮革命委员会。正在这个时候，毛主席发出了最新指示。革命委员会便狠抓阶级斗争，领导广大革命群众向阶级敌人进攻，挖出了一小撮叛徒、特务、反革命分子。广大革命职工从这些触目惊心的阶级斗争的活教材中，更深刻地领会了毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导。他们不但无比仇恨这些反革命分子，而且无比仇恨这些反革命分子的黑后台中国赫鲁晓夫。他们纷纷起来狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论以及他的反动的建党路线。
    北京邮票厂是建立革命委员会最早的工厂之一，革命、生产搞得都比较好，不断受到外单位的称赞。职工当中也有人认为：“阶级敌人已经完蛋，我们厂风平浪静了。”事实并不是这样。有一个走资派，表面上装得很“老实”，暗中却和厂内外的坏家伙勾勾搭搭，秘密来往。从去年下半年开始，他就打起“反对极‘左’思潮”的旗号，从右的方面向无产阶级革命派反攻倒算。这个走资派以“登门访问”“认错交心”为名，先后到八十多户职工家里，在群众中大肆制造翻案舆论。他还记了大量的变天账。在毛主席的最新指示启示下，这个厂的革命群众提高了觉悟，擦亮了眼睛，揪住了他的狐狸尾巴，戳穿了他的反革命两面派面目。
    北京综合仪器厂的无产阶级革命派，带着战斗的喜悦来欢度佳节。为了迎接“五一”，全厂职工以毛主席最新指示为纲，狠抓阶级斗争，持续地深入地开展革命的大批判，迎来了一片大好形势。党内一小撮走资派，混进党内的叛徒、特务、反革命分子，陷入了“人民战争”的汪洋大海之中。今天来天安门欢度佳节之前，全厂职工和家属带着强烈的阶级仇恨，对党内一小撮走资派进行了批判斗争。
    在天安门广场上，人民解放军的队伍整齐雄壮。他们永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于党，永远忠于人民，是一座钢铁的长城。
    伟大的领袖毛主席啊！您发出了“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，我们的人民解放军就肩负起“三支”、“两军”的光荣任务，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，立下了新的伟大的功勋。
    在革命委员会中，军队代表带来了革命传统，促进了革委会成员的思想革命化。平谷县革委会的军队代表，一贯把学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席的最新指示，当作自己最崇高的职责。最近，他们又根据毛主席的最新指示和本县当前阶级斗争的形势，帮助革委会在全县进一步开展革命大批判，查走资派的幕后活动，查叛徒、特务，查地、富、反、坏、右的破坏活动。
    北京半工半读物资管理学校革命委员会成立后，有些人看不到在胜利的锣鼓声中还有阶级斗争，认为“大江大河都过来了，小河沟里还翻得了船？”但是，就在校革委会抓复课闹革命时，阶级敌人跳了出来，煽阴风，点鬼火，妄图破坏复课闹革命。这些现象引起了驻校解放军支左同志的注意，他们立即组织大家学习毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，向阶级敌人展开进攻，使全校复课闹革命健康发展。
    参加晚会的北京空军某部部分指战员，畅谈了国内外阶级斗争的大好形势。学习毛主席著作积极分子、某部副政委陈树尧激动地说：“毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，是全世界反美斗争的新的进军号。毛主席的最新指示，对无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义和阶级内容作了最深刻的概括，是国内阶级斗争的新的动员令。敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来。”
    这些空军指战员庄严地宣誓：“敬爱的毛主席啊，您亲自培育的人民空军，一定听您的话，既做国内革命的促进派，又做国际革命的促进派，要用鲜血凝成的‘忠’字，筑起保卫您的钢铁长城！保卫您，就是保卫无产阶级文化大革命，就是保卫劳动人民的根本利益！”这发自肺腑的庄严誓言，代表了全军广大指战员的心声。
      “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”首都人民最热爱人民解放军，最拥护人民解放军。“相信和依靠人民解放军”，这是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的重要组成部分。许多革命群众说：“阶级敌人越是反对人民解放军，我们越要学习人民解放军。”今晚天安门广场上，军民一同庆祝“五一”劳动节，军爱民，民拥军，鱼水相依，亲密无间，一同唱歌，一同欢呼“毛主席万岁”，真是“军民团结如一人”。
    夜已深了，北京城还沉浸在节日的欢乐里。初夏的夜空，被几十道探照灯的光芒组成美丽壮观的图案。天安门广场上，回响着《大海航行靠舵手》的雄壮歌声。
    首都的无产阶级革命派和劳动人民，在同伟大导师毛主席一起欢度“五一”佳节之后，将更加勇猛地乘胜前进，迎接更伟大的斗争，迎接无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！　本报记者
