The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The socialist road is the only road for China's agriculture." Chairman Mao's words have struck a chord with us broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. The socialist collective economy, especially the people's commune, has brought us poor and lower-middle peasants unprecedented happiness. However, China's Khrushchev, driven by his counterrevolutionary nature, has been vigorously attacking the people's commune, advocating "three selfs and one contract," and attempting to restore capitalism, which is utterly malicious.

In January of this year, when our brigade's production teams were establishing and strengthening their leadership cadres, the village-head production team, under the instigation of a landlord element, stirred up a wind of dividing the team. The landlord element secretly advocated dividing the team, driven by his class nature of hating proletarian dictatorship and socialism, attempting to break up the brigade into small teams and turn small teams into individual farming. The "three selfs and one contract" and individual farming advocated by China's Khrushchev represent the interests of landlords and rich peasants.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, once grasped, is all-powerful." We, along with the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the village-head production team, took class struggle as the key link, held study classes on Mao Zedong Thought in the team, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, conducted bitterness education, and carried out extensive revolutionary criticism and denunciation. We severely criticized China's Khrushchev's counterrevolutionary fallacies of "three selfs and one contract," etc. This way, we raised the masses' awareness, opened their eyes, exposed the landlord element who advocated dividing the team, and dealt a heavy blow to the class enemy.

Through the living example of class struggle education, this team consolidated the collective economy, strengthened the leadership cadre, and fully mobilized the socialistic enthusiasm of the commune members. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants deeply felt: If we only focus on production and do not grasp class struggle and revolutionary criticism and denunciation, we are fools. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, never forget class struggle, never forget proletarian dictatorship, and carry out extensive and sustained revolutionary criticism and denunciation to severely strike down all the sabotage activities of the class enemy.

    狠批“三自一包”黑货，在社会主义道路上奋勇前进
    集瑞大队领导班子成员　谢传涛
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“社会主义的道路是我国农业唯一的道路。”毛主席的话，说到了我们广大贫下中农的心坎上。社会主义集体经济，特别是人民公社，给我们贫下中农带来了前所未有的幸福。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫却从他的反革命本性出发，大肆攻击人民公社，鼓吹“三自一包”，妄图复辟资本主义，真是恶毒透顶。
    今年一月份，我们大队的各生产队在建立和健全领导班子的时候，村头生产队却在一个地主分子的策划下，刮起了一股分队的歪风。地主分子暗地里鼓吹分队，是出于他仇视无产阶级专政、仇视社会主义的阶级本性，妄想把大队拆成小队，小队变成单干。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“三自一包”、“单干”，就是代表地主、富农的利益的。
    毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”。我们和村头生产队的贫下中农、革命干部，以阶级斗争为纲，在队里大办毛泽东思想学习班，大家反复学习毛主席的有关教导，进行忆苦思甜，深入开展革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”等反革命谬论。这样一来，提高了群众的觉悟，擦亮了群众的眼睛，挖出了那个鼓吹分队的地主分子，狠狠地打击了阶级敌人。
    通过活生生的阶级斗争的教育，这个队巩固了集体经济，健全了领导班子，充分调动了社员的社会主义积极性。广大贫下中农深有感受地说：光抓生产，不抓阶级斗争，不抓革命大批判，这就是糊涂人。我们一定牢记毛主席的教导，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，深入持久地开展革命大批判，狠狠地打击阶级敌人的一切破坏活动。（附图片）
