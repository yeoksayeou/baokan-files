Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. Words cannot express our boundless love for Chairman Mao, and songs cannot sing his boundless admiration. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, advance triumphantly, and seize complete victory in the first proletarian cultural revolution in human history.

    毛主席是我们心中的红太阳，千言万语说不尽我们对毛主席的无限热爱，千歌万曲唱不完我们对毛主席的无限敬仰。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，乘胜前进，夺取人类历史上第一次无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。　本报记者摄
