Chairman Mao teaches us: “The most fundamental aspect of reforming state organs is to connect with the masses.” Since our school’s revolutionary committee was established in June last year, we have followed Chairman Mao’s teachings, taken Mao Zedong Thought as our banner in our work, trusted the masses, relied on the masses, and mobilized the masses to carry out Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line.

Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as the principal leader of the school, I spent too much time issuing orders from my office and too little time learning from the masses in practice; I spent too much time discussing work with cadres and too little time interacting with students to solve problems; people listened to me too much, and I listened to them too little. Over time, this led to a situation where I was aloof from the masses and out of touch with their pulse. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution gave me a profound lesson, making me deeply understand that “the masses are the real heroes, and we ourselves are often childish and ignorant, not understanding this point means not obtaining even the most basic knowledge.” I truly saw that “the masses harbor a tremendous socialist enthusiasm,” saw the revolutionary masses’ boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, saw the revolutionary masses’ political enthusiasm for national affairs, and understood that “the people, only the people, are the motive force in the creation of world history.” I realized that a revolutionary cadre, to wield power for the proletariat, must closely connect with the masses, treat the masses with a truly equal attitude, and always maintain the character of the working people. Therefore, after the masses supported me to stand up and work, entrusting me with a revolutionary mission, I always remembered Chairman Mao’s teachings and strove to serve the people wholeheartedly, never separating from the masses.

“The revolutionary committee formed by the ‘three-in-one combination’ is a creation of the working class and the people in this cultural revolution.” It inherently has broad mass character. As revolutionary cadres, to closely connect with the masses, we must consult well with these representatives from the masses, seriously listen to their opinions, correctly implement democratic centralism, firmly rely on this fighting collective, and fully mobilize everyone’s revolutionary enthusiasm and initiative.

The members of our school’s revolutionary committee, except for two cadres, are all representatives of the masses, including teachers, students, and staff. They have different ages and positions, representing various opinions, and possess the advantage of combining the old, middle-aged, and young. Because the committee members come from different positions and stand in different angles, their ideological levels and experiences in struggle vary, so when discussing issues, debates are often very heated. Especially the revolutionary youngsters, with open hearts and without any reservations, dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. In such a situation, I do not issue orders as an individual, nor do I, as an old cadre, suppress others. Instead, I guide everyone to speak freely, learn from and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the debate, and reach unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought’s principles.

Although most members of the revolutionary committee are representatives of the revolutionary masses, if they become aloof from the masses after entering the revolutionary committee, they will gradually lose their role as representatives of the masses. Chairman Mao teaches us: “Only by representing the masses can one educate the masses; only by being a student of the masses can one be a teacher of the masses.” I and the committee members of the revolutionary committee often use Chairman Mao’s teachings to examine and urge ourselves. The members of our school’s revolutionary committee are mostly members of various revolutionary committees. In their daily lives and studies, they are among the masses. I am the same. In the past, I worked in the office, lived in the office, and even had my meals in the office. Now, I eat in the dining hall and sleep in the collective dormitory. My bag contains the necessary documents for work and study. Wherever I go, I work and study with the local masses. Because the members of the revolutionary committee insist on Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line and can breathe and fight with the masses, the revolutionary teachers and students enthusiastically support the newly born revolutionary committee and enthusiastically support the work of revolutionary cadres. In the face of heavy tasks, everyone pools their wisdom and overcomes numerous difficulties, achieving one victory after another. For example, in January of this year, the masses displayed tremendous enthusiasm. Without increasing personnel or adding equipment, they not only successfully completed the task of enrolling new students but also, as soon as the new students entered school, immediately held Mao Zedong Thought study classes and quickly established a new revolutionary order. Especially the revolutionary youngsters, who love Chairman Mao the most and listen to Chairman Mao the most, have a firm stance and clear banner. In the intense struggle between the two lines, to defend the new revolutionary committee, they worked day and night writing big-character posters, denouncing the bourgeois reactionary trend. Whatever tasks the revolutionary committee assigns to them, regardless of the cold weather and biting north wind, they strive to complete them. Their pure, firm, selfless, and fearless revolutionary spirit and sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm deeply infect and inspire me to work better for the Party and the people.

We listen humbly to all opinions from below, but after listening, we conduct a class analysis. For correct opinions, we sincerely accept them, such as the masses proposing to strengthen ideological and political work, and the standing committee to participate in collective leadership by going deep into the company committees, etc., we all accepted. For incorrect opinions, we help the masses raise their awareness in a friendly manner; for some trends and evil winds that represent social reactionary trends, we dare to resist and firmly criticize. Only in this way can we not alienate the majority of the masses and truly connect with and represent the masses.

The key to whether the members of the revolutionary committee can closely connect with the masses is to study and apply Chairman Mao’s works actively, achieving ideological revolutionization. As the chairman of the revolutionary committee, I should take the lead in this aspect. Over the past ten months, with the help of the PLA and the revolutionary masses, I have used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to constantly struggle against selfishness and revisionism, gradually raising my class consciousness and ideological level. After entering the revolutionary three-in-one combination leadership cadre, my work is very busy, and social activities are frequent. Often working day and night, the work is still not done, and sometimes selfishness shows its head. I immediately seize this sign, seriously study the “Three Constantly Read Articles,” use Chairman Mao’s teachings of “completely” and “thoroughly” as two rulers, and use Comrade White’s two “extremes” to strictly demand of myself. When work is going smoothly, I always remember Chairman Mao’s teachings: “We should be modest, prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and wholeheartedly serve the Chinese people,” paying attention to preventing arrogance and complacency, preventing alienation from the masses. In the intense struggle between the two lines, I study Chairman Mao’s teachings on “never forgetting class struggle” and “On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People” every day, raising my class struggle consciousness and strictly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions, firmly implementing the Party’s policies, and overcoming all selfish thoughts.

I and the other comrades in the revolutionary committee deeply feel that to always maintain the fresh revolutionary style of the proletarian dictatorship, the fundamental thing is to be loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao. With loyalty to Chairman Mao, we can always maintain the character of the working people, doing both “being an official” and “being a common person”; we can be happy to accept the supervision of the masses, always insist on the mass line, serve the people wholeheartedly, and never separate from the masses.

    绝不辜负群众的信任，全心全意为人民服务
    北京女七中革命委员会主任　沈言
    毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”我校革命委员会自去年六月建立以来，遵循毛主席的教导，在工作中，坚持以毛泽东思想挂帅，充分信任群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，贯彻执行了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    无产阶级文化大革命以前，我作为学校的主要领导干部，坐办公室发号施令多，深入实际向群众学习少；和干部开会研究工作多，和学生接触商讨问题少；大家听我的多，我听大家的少。久而久之，便产生了高高在上、脱离群众的现象，摸不到广大群众的脉搏。无产阶级文化大革命给了我深刻的教训，使我深刻地领会到：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识”，真正看到了“群众中蕴藏了一种极大的社会主义的积极性”，看到了革命群众对毛主席的无限忠心，看到了革命群众关心国家大事的政治热情，懂得了“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”。我认识到，一个革命领导干部，要为无产阶级掌好权、用好权，就必须密切联系群众，以真正平等的态度对待群众，永远保持劳动人民的本色。因此，当群众支持我站起来工作，付我以革命重任以后，我时刻牢记毛主席的教导，努力做到全心全意为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众。
    “‘三结合’的革命委员会，是工人阶级和人民群众在这次文化大革命中的一种创造。”它本身就具有广泛的群众性。作为革命领导干部，要密切联系群众，就必须很好地和这些来自群众的代表商量办事，认真地听取他们的意见，正确地实行民主集中制，坚决依靠这个战斗的集体，充分发挥大家的革命积极性和主动性。
    我校革命委员会成员，除两名干部外，其余都是群众的代表，有教师，有学生，有职工，年龄不同，职务不同，代表着各方面的意见，具备老、中、少结合的优点。由于委员们来自不同的岗位，站在不同的角度，思想水平和斗争经历各有差异，所以在讨论问题的时候，往往争论非常热烈。尤其是革命小将，襟怀坦白，毫无顾虑，敢想、敢说、敢干。在这种情况下，我不是个人发号施令，以老干部自居去压服别人，而是引导大家畅所欲言，在争辩中活学活用毛泽东思想，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上达到统一。
    革命委员会的成员虽然大多数是革命群众的代表，但进入革命委员会后，如果高高在上，脱离了群众，慢慢地就会丧失代表群众的作用。毛主席教导我们：“只有代表群众才能教育群众，只有做群众的学生才能做群众的先生。”我和革委会的委员经常用毛主席的教导检查自己，督促自己。我校革命委员会委员，绝大多数是各排文革的成员，平时生活、学习在群众之中。我也是这样。过去我坐办公室，住办公室，吃饭也回办公室；现在吃在伙房，睡在集体宿舍，挂包里装着工作和学习的必需文件，走到那里，就和那里的群众一起工作，一起学习。正因为革委会的成员坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，又能同群众同呼吸，共战斗，所以革命师生热情地支持新生的革命委员会，热情地支持革命干部工作。在任务繁重的情况下，大家群策群力，克服了许多困难，取得了一个又一个的胜利。如今年一月份，群众发挥了冲天干劲，在不增人员、不添设备的情况下，不但顺利地完成了招收新生的任务；而且新生一入学，立即举办毛泽东思想学习班，迅速地建立了革命新秩序。特别是革命小将，最热爱毛主席，最听毛主席的话，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明。在两条路线斗争的激烈时刻，为了维护新生的革命委员会，他们夜以继日写大字报，痛斥资产阶级反动思潮。只要是革委会分配给他们的任务，不管天气寒冷，北风凛冽，他们都努力去完成。他们那纯洁坚定、无私无畏的革命豪情和冲天的革命干劲，深深地感染着我，激励着我更好地为党为人民工作。
    凡是来自下面的意见，我们都虚心倾听，但是听了以后，再做阶级分析。对于正确的意见，我们诚恳地接受，如群众提出要加强思想政治工作，常委要深入连委会参加集体领导，等等，我们都接受了。对于错误的意见，就善意地帮助群众提高认识；对一些代表社会反动思潮的歪风邪气，则敢于抵制，坚决批判。只有这样，才不会脱离群众的大多数，才是真正联系群众，代表群众。
    革委会的成员能不能做到密切联系群众，关键的一环是活学活用毛主席著作，实现思想革命化。我作为革命委员会的主任，更应当在这方面起带头作用。十个月来，我在解放军和革命群众的帮助下，用毛泽东思想为武器，不断斗私批修，逐步地提高了阶级觉悟和思想水平。进入革命三结合领导班子以后，工作非常繁忙，社会活动又多，常常夜以继日，工作还是做不完，有时私字便露头了，有些社会活动就想推掉。我及时抓住这个苗头，认真学习“老三篇”，用毛主席教导的“完全”、“彻底”两把尺子，用白求恩同志的两个“极端”，严格要求自己。当工作顺利的时候，我时刻牢记毛主席的教导：“我们应该谦虚，谨慎，戒骄，戒躁，全心全意地为中国人民服务”，注意防止骄傲自满情绪，防止脱离群众。在两条路线斗争的激烈时刻，我每天学习毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导和《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，既提高阶级斗争的观念，又严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，坚决执行党的政策，克服一切私心杂念。
    我和革委会的其他同志深深地感到，革命委员会要始终如一地保持无产阶级政权的崭新的革命作风，根本的根本，是要对我们伟大领袖毛主席赤胆忠心。有了对毛主席的忠，就能永远保持劳动人民的本色，做到“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”；就能乐于接受群众的监督，永远坚持群众路线，全心全意为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众。
