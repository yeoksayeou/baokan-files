In the great situation where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is on the verge of complete victory, during the fighting holiday of May Day when the proletariat and working people of the whole world are celebrating, I again saw our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao on the magnificent and grand Tiananmen Rostrum. Chairman Mao was radiant and full of vigor, his steps were firm, and his health was extremely good. He smiled and waved to us repeatedly. I could not hold back my tears of happiness and kept shouting: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! I wish Chairman Mao eternal life!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Every time you receive me, you give me boundless strength and wisdom. To be received by you is the greatest happiness. I hurried back to my company at night to report the great news of being received by you to the commanders and comrades. The whole company was in high spirits, and everyone shouted: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by you, has already achieved decisive great victories. You recently instructed us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat under the condition of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." I must combine this with the actual class struggle, further seriously study and deeply understand your great teachings. The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to complete victory, the more complex and sharp the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines will be. The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, and those traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the Party, will not readily accept their defeat. They will make their last struggle. We must be a hundred times more vigilant, firmly hold our guns, and be alert to the enemy's plots. If they dare to cause trouble and sabotage, we will give them a resolute and merciless blow.

We are infinitely loyal to you, infinitely loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to your proletarian revolutionary line. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow your great strategic deployment, direct the spearhead of struggle at the handful of class enemies, and carry out a prolonged and in-depth revolutionary criticism. We will thoroughly criticize and expose the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, such as China's Khrushchev. We will resolutely defend the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and defend the new revolutionary power—the Revolutionary Committees. We will bravely advance to seize complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　乘胜前进，夺取文化大革命全面胜利
　　装甲兵学习毛主席著作积极分子　石福田
    在无产阶级文化大革命夺取全面胜利的大好形势下，正当全世界无产阶级和劳动人民庆祝“五一”国际劳动节的战斗节日里，在宏伟壮丽的天安门城楼上，我又一次见到了我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席。毛主席红光满面，神采奕奕，步伐矫健，身体非常非常健康。他老人家微笑着频频向我们招手致意，我抑制不住幸福的热泪，不断振臂高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！万万岁！敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家每接见我一次，都给我增添了无穷的力量和智慧，受到您老人家的接见是最大的幸福。我连夜赶回连队，向首长和同志们汇报受到您的接见的特大喜讯，全连上下一片欢腾，大家千遍万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    您老人家亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了决定性的伟大胜利。您最近教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”我一定要结合阶级斗争的实际，进一步认真学习、深刻领会您的伟大教导。无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，越是复杂，越是尖锐。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派，和那些混进党内的叛徒、特务、反革命分子，决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。我们一定要百倍提高警惕，紧握手中枪，警惕阶级敌人的阴谋活动。如果他们胆敢进行破坏和捣乱，我们就坚决、无情地给以狠狠的打击。
    我们无限忠于您，无限忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，无限忠于您的无产阶级革命路线，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟您的伟大战略部署，把斗争矛头对准一小撮阶级敌人，持久深入地开展革命大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派批深批透，斗倒斗臭。我们一定要誓死保卫以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫新生的革命政权——革命委员会，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋勇前进！
