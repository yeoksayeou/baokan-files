Xinjing Electric Tool Factory successfully trials a new type of sheep shears. The efficiency is several times higher than ordinary sheep shears, greatly reducing the labor intensity of the operator, reaching international advanced levels.

New China News Agency, Xining, May 5th - The revolutionary workers of Xinjing Electric Tool Factory have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, relied on their own efforts, and jointly designed and successfully trialed a double-insulated single-phase series-excited sheep shear with the Shanghai Electric Tool Research Institute, making a new contribution to the mechanization of China's livestock production.

This new electric sheep shear has an efficiency several times higher than ordinary sheep shears, and the labor intensity of the operator is greatly reduced, reaching international advanced levels.

During the trial process, the revolutionary workers of this factory seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." "Any new thing's growth is bound to encounter twists and turns. In socialist undertakings, if one wants to avoid twists and turns and not pay great efforts, always have smooth sailing and easily achieve success, this kind of idea is just an illusion."

Under the great encouragement of Chairman Mao's teachings, the workers fear no difficulties, fail and try again, and finally achieve success.

In the trial work, this factory received the support and help of Qinghai Province Agricultural Machinery Factory, Plastic Factory, and some related factories in provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions.

Not long ago, this factory held a trial shearing on-site meeting. Representatives from more than 30 relevant units in Qinghai watched the trial shearing of China's new sheep shears and similar foreign products and unanimously praised the many outstanding advantages of China's new sheep shears.

　　西宁电动工具厂试制成功新式羊毛剪
    工效比普通羊毛剪提高几倍，操作者的劳动强度大为减轻，达到国际先进水平
    新华社西宁五日电  西宁电动工具厂革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，自力更生，和上海电动工具研究所联合设计试制成功了一种双重绝缘单相串激式羊毛剪，为我国牧业生产的机械化作出了新的贡献。
    这种新式电动羊毛剪，工效要比普通羊毛剪提高好几倍，操作者的劳动强度也大为减轻，达到了国际先进水平。
    在试制过程中，这个厂的革命职工认真学习了毛主席的教导：“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。”“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的。在社会主义事业中，要想不经过艰难曲折，不付出极大努力，总是一帆风顺，容易得到成功，这种想法，只是幻想。”
    在毛主席的伟大教导鼓舞下，职工们不怕任何困难，失败了再干，终于获得成功。
    在试制工作上，这个厂得到了青海省农牧机械厂、塑料厂以及一些省、市、自治区有关兄弟厂的支持和帮助。
    不久前，这个厂召开了试剪现场会。青海有关的三十多个单位的代表，观看了我国新式羊毛剪和国外同类产品的试剪对比，一致称赞我国新式羊毛剪有许多突出的优点。
