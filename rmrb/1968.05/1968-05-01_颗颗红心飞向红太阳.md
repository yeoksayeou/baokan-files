Each Red Heart Flies Towards the Red Sun
Soldier of the Liberation Army Cheng Anyao

I stand guard day and night by the side of our great teacher, great leader Chairman Mao, and my whole being is bathed in the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought. I feel boundless happiness and boundless honor. Especially during the fiery days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, each red heart from all corners of the motherland flies towards Beijing, towards the red sun. I have personally witnessed countless moving scenes of the revolutionary people's boundless love for Chairman Mao. During the nationwide celebration of May Day, I have selected a few episodes to share with the readers the joy of the revolution.

Offering a Banner and Studying the Treasure Book

On a late night in November 1966, several dozen Red Guards sat under the giant color portrait of Chairman Mao at the gate of Zhongnanhai, deeply engrossed in studying the works of Chairman Mao. Beside them were the backpacks they had brought with them. To the east, a bright and dazzling banner was inserted, on which a red sun was embroidered with silk thread. Under the sun, many small stars were embroidered, and below them, fifteen large characters read: "Red hearts turn towards Chairman Mao, a lifetime following Chairman Mao." At the bottom, a line of small characters read: "Certain Female Middle School in Shenyang, Certain Certain Battle Team."

I asked, "Are you going back now?"

They replied, "No, we just arrived in Beijing!"

It turned out that they had planned this in their school. As soon as they arrived in Beijing, they wanted to study Chairman Mao's works seriously by his side. So, after arriving in Beijing the previous afternoon, they had been sitting here studying since six o'clock.

It was four in the morning. Several little generals ran over and asked me, "Is our Chairman Mao in good health?" I said, "Chairman Mao is in excellent health, full of vigor and vitality." Upon hearing this, they cheered, jumped, and raised their bright red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" high, shouting enthusiastically, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand, ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!"

They told me that the banner was carefully embroidered by themselves, expressing their hearts' eternal loyalty to Chairman Mao. They confidently said that when Chairman Mao inspects the Red Guards, they will present this banner to Chairman Mao.

Steel-like Oath

One morning, while on duty, a worker approached me and asked, "Soldier, is Chairman Mao in good health?" After hearing that Chairman Mao was in excellent health, he beamed with joy, looked deeply at Zhongnanhai, and repeatedly said, "Chairman Mao's good health is our greatest happiness, our greatest joy!"

This worker came from Shanghai. Their factory had established a revolutionary committee and sent him to Beijing to report the good news to the great leader Chairman Mao and to learn the experience of making Chairman Mao badges in Beijing. He took out a piece of red satin covered with various Chairman Mao badges to show me and told me: The Chinese Khrushchov and his ilk fiercely oppose Chairman Mao, committing heinous crimes. We, the working class, love and are loyal to Chairman Mao without bounds. We will make even better, shining Chairman Mao badges. As he spoke, he walked to the portrait of Chairman Mao, looked up, raised his right hand, and passionately swore, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We workers are infinitely loyal to you! We will definitely follow your teachings, listen to your words, read your books, propagate your thoughts, and defend your proletarian revolutionary line. Whoever opposes you, we will definitely overthrow them!" After taking the oath, he walked back and forth in front of the portrait, unwilling to leave. Finally, he picked up a few leaves from the ground and put them in his pocket, excitedly saying, "These are leaves from near Chairman Mao. I'll take them back as a souvenir."

The worker left reluctantly, and my emotions remained unsettled for a long time. Just then, our great leader Chairman Mao passed by in his car, and I was so moved that tears welled up in my eyes. In my heart, I sang my favorite song, "The East is Red, the sun rises..."

Two Packets of Soil

Another day, an old man hurried over. He was dressed in clean, coarse cloth clothes, with a shining Chairman Mao badge on his chest. He stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, gazing at it, then looked into Zhongnanhai, and then back at the portrait. After a while, he squatted down by the side of Chairman Mao's portrait and packed a packet of soil.

"Grandpa, why are you packing soil?" I asked.

The old man stood up, looked at me, and smiled, saying, "Our Henan province has a lot of saline-alkali land. Last year, when I came to Beijing to visit relatives, I brought back a packet of soil from near Chairman Mao. The poor and lower-middle peasants were very happy. Everyone spread it on a few heavily saline-alkali plots in our brigade. Although the soil was not much, everyone was inspired, and their morale was high. They vowed to turn the saline-alkali land into good fields. Everyone worked from dawn to dusk, draining water and fertilizing. In just one year, these heavily saline plots were transformed into good land. So, I came to bring back some more soil from near Chairman Mao..." The old man said, holding a packet of soil, and walked to Chairman Mao's portrait, telling me, "The Chinese Khrushchov opposes Chairman Mao, but we poor and lower-middle peasants will follow Chairman Mao for life, forever! Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our village has changed a lot. You should go and see! Everywhere, there are quotations from Chairman Mao, everyone reads Chairman Mao's books, and everyone can sing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations. In the past, we talked about work points; now we talk about serving the people. In the past, we were a low-yield brigade, eating state-supplied grain; now we are a high-yield brigade, selling surplus grain to the state. This is all thanks to Chairman Mao!" The old man said excitedly, very moved, with tears in his eyes. He didn't know how to express his love for Chairman Mao.

A Jug of Clear Spring Water

In the morning, I stood at my post facing the sunrise. A soldier in a new uniform, carrying a water jug, took three steps at a time, eagerly running to stand in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. He put down the jug, respectfully saluted Chairman Mao's portrait, and wished Chairman Mao eternal life! He recited a few of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and then sang "The East is Red."

After singing, he turned to me and said he came from the Sino-Indian border. He handed me the jug with both hands and solemnly said, "This is a jug of the best spring water from the Karakoram Mountains brought by my comrades. Please pour it into Zhongnanhai. It expresses the longing of countless border guards for Chairman Mao and symbolizes that the border guards' hearts are forever connected with Chairman Mao's. Comrade, please give us a jug of water from Zhongnanhai, so that my comrades can grow healthily under Chairman Mao's care."

I was touched and quickly took the jug. I understood that I was not holding an ordinary jug of water but the boundless love of countless border guards for Chairman Mao. The soldier held my hand and said, "You guard by Chairman Mao's side and can see Chairman Mao often, how fortunate! Of course, our duties are different, but our goal is one: to serve the people under Chairman Mao's leadership and Vice Chairman Lin's direct command. Revolutionary soldiers must be single-heartedly loyal to Chairman Mao, with a red heart to protect Chairman Mao, protect Mao Zedong Thought, and protect Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line."

Later, I often recalled his words: single-heartedly loyal to Chairman Mao, with a red heart to protect Chairman Mao... This comrade spoke for the hearts of countless soldiers.

　　颗颗红心飞向红太阳
　　解放军战士　程安耀
      我日夜守卫在我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖毛主席身旁，全身心沐浴着毛泽东思想的阳光。我感到无限幸福，无限光荣。特别是在无产阶级文化大革命的火热的日子里，颗颗红心从祖国的四面八方飞向北京城，飞向红太阳。我亲眼看到革命人民无限热爱毛主席的许许多多感人肺腑的情景。在举国欢庆“五一”节的时候，我从中挑出几段来，让读者和我一起分享革命的欢乐。
    献锦旗　学宝书
    一九六六年十一月的一个深夜，几十个红卫兵小将围坐在中南海门前毛主席彩色巨幅画像下，聚精会神地学习毛主席著作。她们身旁放着随身带来的背包。靠东插着一面光彩夺目的锦旗，上面用丝线绣着一轮红太阳，太阳下面绣了许多小星星，再下面绣着十五个大字：“红心向着毛主席，一辈子跟着毛主席”，最下面绣着一行小字：“沈阳某女中，某某某战斗队”。
    我问：“你们现在要回去了吗？”
    她们说：“不，我们刚到北京哩！”
    原来她们在学校的时候就商量好了，一到北京，首先要在毛主席身边认真学习毛主席著作。所以她们昨天下午到了北京之后，从六点开始就坐在这里学习了。
    清晨四点钟了。几位小将跑过来问我：“咱们毛主席身体好吗？”我说：“毛主席满面红光，精神焕发，身体非常非常健康。”她们一听，欢呼起来，又蹦又跳，高高举起红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，尽情地喊着：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”
      她们告诉我，锦旗是她们自己精心细致地绣成的，表达着她们永远忠于毛主席的颗颗红心。她们满怀信心地表示：在毛主席检阅红卫兵的时候，她们将把这面锦旗献给毛主席。
    钢铁誓言
    一天上午，我在值勤。一位工人走到我跟前，第一句话就问：“解放军同志，毛主席他老人家身体好吗？”当他听到毛主席身体非常非常健康的答复后，他满面笑容，深情地望着中南海，连声说：“毛主席的身体非常健康，是我们最大的幸福，最大的快乐！”
    这位工人来自上海。他们工厂成立了革命委员会，派他来北京向伟大领袖毛主席报喜，并且要在北京学习制作毛主席像章的经验。他拿出一块别满各式各样毛主席像章的红绸子给我看，告诉我：中国赫鲁晓夫之流拚命反对毛主席，罪恶滔天。我们工人阶级无限热爱、无限忠于毛主席。我们要制作出更好的金光闪闪的毛主席像章来。他一面说着一面走到毛主席像前，仰望着，举起右手激情地宣誓：“毛主席啊，毛主席！我们工人无限忠于您！我们坚决照您的教导去做，听您的话，读您的书，宣传您的思想，捍卫您的无产阶级革命路线。谁反对您，我们就坚决打倒谁！”他宣完誓，在毛主席像前来回走着，不舍得离开，最后在墙下拾起几片树叶揣在怀里，兴奋地说：“这是毛主席身边的树叶，我带回去做个纪念。”
    工人同志依依不舍地走了，我的心情久久不能平静下来。正在这时，我们伟大领袖毛主席坐车从我面前经过，我激动得热泪盈眶，在心底里唱起了我最爱唱的歌：“东方红，太阳升……。”
    两包泥土
    又一天，一位老大爷急匆匆地走过来。他穿着一身整洁的粗布衣裳，胸前别着闪闪发光的毛主席像章，走到毛主席像前便站住了，凝望着毛主席像，又向中南海里边看看，再看看毛主席像；看了好一会，又到毛主席像旁边的地上蹲下来，包了一包土。
    “大爷，您包土干什么？”我问。
    大爷直起腰来，看着我笑了笑说：“我们河南盐碱地多。去年俺来北京走亲戚，带了毛主席身边的一包土回去，贫下中农社员们可高兴啦。大伙把它撒在我们队里几块盐碱重的地里，土虽然不多，可大伙受到鼓舞，劲头可大啦，发誓要把盐碱地变成良田。大伙起早贪黑地干，排水施肥。只有一年工夫，这几块重碱地就改造成了好地。所以我再把毛主席身边的土带一些回去。……”大爷说着，捧着一包土，又走到毛主席像前，对我说：“中国赫鲁晓夫反对毛主席，我们贫下中农一辈子跟着毛主席，跟定了！自从无产阶级文化大革命以来，俺村变化可大啦，你去看看！处处贴着毛主席语录，人人读毛主席的书，个个会唱毛主席语录歌。过去讲工分，现在讲为人民服务。过去是减产队，吃国家供应粮；现在是增产队，向国家卖余粮。这都是托毛主席的福啊！”大爷兴奋地说着，非常激动，脸上还挂着几颗泪珠。他不知怎样才能表达出他热爱毛主席的感情来。
    一壶清泉水
    清晨，我迎着朝阳，站在哨位上。有位战士穿着一身崭新的军装，背着一个水壶，三步并作两步，兴冲冲地跑到毛主席像前站住了。他放下水壶，恭恭敬敬地向毛主席像敬了礼，敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！背了几段毛主席的最新指示，接着他唱起了《东方红》。
    唱完歌，他转过身来告诉我，他是从中印边界来的。他双手把水壶递给我，郑重地说：“这是战友们托我带来的一壶喀喇昆仑山上最好的清泉水，请你把它倒进中南海。它表达我们许许多多边防战士对毛主席的怀念，它象征着我们边防战士永远和毛主席心连心。同志，请你给我们一壶中南海里的水，我把它带回边疆，好让同志们在毛主席的雨露下健康成长。”
    我听了，心里热呼呼的，连忙接过水壶。我明白，我捧着的不是一壶普通的水，我捧着的是千千万万颗边防战士无限热爱毛主席的红心。那位战士握着我的手说：“你们守卫在毛主席身边，能够经常见到毛主席，真幸福啊！当然，我们分工不同，目标是一个，都是在毛主席的领导下，林副主席的直接指挥下为人民服务。我们革命战士就是要一个心眼忠于毛主席，一颗红心保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。”
    后来，我常常回味着他这几句话：一个心眼忠于毛主席，一颗红心保卫毛主席……。这位战友说出了我们无数战士的心里话。
