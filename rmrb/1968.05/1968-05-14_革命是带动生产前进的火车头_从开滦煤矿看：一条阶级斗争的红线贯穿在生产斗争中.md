Revolution is the locomotive driving production forward: A red line of class struggle runs through the production struggle at the Kailuan Coal Mine

Kailuan Coal Mine is one of the largest coal mines in China.

The revolutionary workers of Kailuan Coal Mine, with a tradition of revolutionary struggle, responded most resolutely to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "seize the revolution and promote production" during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are in the coal mine but have the nation in their hearts and the world in their eyes. They made the revolution roar and production boil, continuously increasing coal production. Since last October, coal production has been rising month by month, with high-yield days following one after another. Currently, they are fighting in the "Red May," striving to exceed the national plan for the entire mining bureau and report good news to Chairman Mao.

The production of Kailuan Coal Mine has had ups and downs during the Cultural Revolution; the situation of class struggle has influenced it, determined it, and driven it. It has developed upward with the progress of the revolution. This once again proves the teachings of the great teacher Chairman Mao: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Revolution is the locomotive driving production forward!

		Where is the focus?

Coal is the grain of industry. Coal production affects China's socialist construction, the lives of urban and rural people, the successful conduct of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the implementation of Chairman Mao's great decision of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people." The Party Central Committee has called on the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionaries on the coal industry front to, with a high sense of responsibility as masters of the state, resolutely push coal production forward.

In March of this year, some comrades from the Tangshan Mine of the Kailuan Mining Bureau were eager to produce more coal and wanted to highlight this issue. They drafted a daily production target higher than the state plan and arranged various measures to seize high production. A decade passed, and the production situation was not ideal.

What was going on? The revolutionary committee of this mine, with the problem in mind, went deep into the mine to listen to the opinions of the masses. The masses said that now the leadership only cares about high production and is busy to the point of breathlessness; class enemies are taking advantage of the situation to sabotage production and are very arrogant; cadres cannot command, and there is resentment; revolutionary masses see that the leadership does not grasp class struggle and are sulking. The masses pointed out the problem with a single stroke. The revolutionary committee of this mine immediately held a meeting to review Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, analyzed the new problems of class struggle in March, and especially studied the various situations of class enemy sabotage activities since the mine proposed high production. They decided to strengthen the leadership of class struggle, mobilize the masses to expose the class struggle, and investigate the crimes of class enemies sabotaging the revolution and production.

In the first few days of late March, this mine launched a high tide of attacks on class enemies. Once the class enemies were exposed, the mine's evil winds and strange customs immediately subsided, production accidents decreased, the authority of the revolutionary committee was strengthened, revolutionary cadres actively commanded production, production order was good, revolutionary masses were in high spirits, enthusiasm for seizing the revolution and promoting production increased, and coal production rose day by day. They quickly achieved the original planned daily production target exceeding the state plan. The masses happily said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Class struggle, once grasped, is effective,' and it is indeed so!"

The revolutionary committee of the Tangjiazhuang Mine of the Kailuan Mining Bureau planned to organize department and office cadres to go to the front line to support production. Someone suggested forming a production team, saying that this would increase coal production tomorrow. After discussion, everyone agreed that this could not be done because it was a reflection of the thought of seeing things but not people, which simply supports labor force. Everyone agreed that the primary task of cadres going down was to highlight politics. Therefore, they organized the cadres going down into 30 Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, went to the production front line, worked and studied Chairman Mao's works with the workers, helped the grassroots establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, grasped class struggle, and carried out a great criticism of the revolution. They did this, and the class struggle at the grassroots level was carried out, the thoughts of the employees were further revolutionized, the production enthusiasm of thousands of employees was mobilized, and production went up. The masses said that these cadres came down to help us promote production with class struggle, which is much better than them simply working.

In the Kailuan mining area, there are many examples that vividly embody the dialectical relationship between class struggle and production.

The revolutionary committee of Kailuan Coal Mine and the supporting PLA comrades have realized from practice that if the focus of work is placed on seizing high production, coal production can sometimes rise for a few days, but it cannot be sustained, and it may even result in low production. Doing so easily leads back to the path of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev. Therefore, when they seize the revolution and promote production, they always focus on fiercely grasping class struggle. Once class struggle is carried out well, production is promoted at the same time.

Production is not purely an economic issue

During the Cultural Revolution, class enemies never relaxed their counter-revolutionary schemes on the issue of coal production. At the beginning, a small handful of capitalist roaders within the Kailuan Coal Mine Party had once wielded the "production" stick in their hands to suppress the revolutionary actions of the workers. Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" gave the revolutionary workers of Kailuan Coal Mine boundless strength. The revolutionary workers rose up to rebel against them and pulled them down from their leadership positions. Later, the class enemies changed their tactics and used the sabotage of coal production to sabotage the Cultural Revolution.

Over the past year, the broad revolutionary workers of Kailuan Coal Mine have fought fiercely with class enemies over the issue of production. Today, this struggle continues.

In the spring of 1967, the PLA responded to Chairman Mao's great call, came to Kailuan Coal Mine to help the proletarian revolutionary factions seize the revolution and promote production, and the production of Kailuan Coal Mine, which had been sabotaged many times by class enemies, quickly rose. Therefore, the class enemies hated the PLA. They knew the political weight of every ton of coal produced by Kailuan Coal Mine. In secret rooms, they plotted: "The PLA can stand firm in Kailuan because they still produce coal. As long as they do not produce coal, all the workers and their families in the entire mining area will oppose the PLA." They used the bourgeois factionalism of some mass organizations to incite, saying: "If you do not take power, no matter how much coal you produce, it is of no use." "If you produce more coal, Comrade X will be promoted." "You cannot work for him!" The Tangjiazhuang Mine of the Kailuan Mining Bureau had good production, with coal production exceeding the plan every month, and was a banner for seizing the revolution and promoting production in the Kailuan mining area. The class enemies regarded the Tangjiazhuang Mine as a thorn in the eye and a splinter in the flesh, shouting that the Tangjiazhuang Mine was a "stubborn fortress" and vowing to "break through" it. They spread rumors to confuse the people: "Someone wants to seal the pit mouth" and prevent workers from going down to work. They incited the personnel of key production departments such as the hoist room and the pump room to leave their posts, attempting to stop water and electricity, sabotage the mine, and put production in a state of paralysis. They instigated armed struggles, stormed the mining area, and sabotaged production.

Facing the sabotage of class enemies, the working class of Kailuan Coal Mine remained unshakable and resolutely implemented the great policy of seizing the revolution and promoting production formulated by the great leader Chairman Mao. They insisted on revolutionary activities in their spare time. They understood that in this great struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, producing one more ton of coal would add one more material force to the proletariat in the battle. They started from the politics of the proletariat and from the overall situation of the state, shouldered the double burden of revolution and production. They resisted evil winds and broke through evil waves, fighting a head-on struggle with class enemies, showing their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao and the sublime qualities of the Chinese working class. At that time, most of the workers of Kailuan Coal Mine were still guarding their production posts. Many old workers said: "Chairman Mao calls on us to seize the revolution and promote production. Leaving the production post is to leave Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." Some production positions lacked manpower, and they worked one for two, one for three. The revolutionary workers in the hoist room and the pump room fearlessly operated the machines and worked continuously. Some old workers said: "The enemy incites a strike, and we will produce more to make Chairman Mao proud and to glorify coal workers! Loyalty is shown in action. Producing one more ton of coal is one more loyalty to Chairman Mao!" After work, many old workers voluntarily went to the homes of class brothers who had not gone to work, explained the situation in the mine, exposed the enemy's rumors, and mobilized class brothers to return to the mine. Some production positions had no one to command, and some old workers voluntarily stepped forward, saying to everyone: "No matter which organization you are from, we workers must be proletarian revolutionaries who listen to Chairman Mao's words. We must implement Chairman Mao's instructions to seize the revolution and promote production." They used their model actions to inspire everyone to work together. At that time, the No. 2 Tunnel Team of the Tangjiazhuang Mine had more than 40 people who had not gone to work for eight days, but they still exceeded the state plan by 11 meters. After this mine repulsed the enemy's attack, coal production rose again and again, exceeding the state plan every month, and always maintaining the red flag of seizing the revolution and promoting production. The coal production of other mines in the Kailuan Mining Bureau also gradually rose in the repeated struggles with class enemies.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "The contradiction, opposition, antagonism, and struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie have become the total source of all our political life and social life." The practice of production struggle in Kailuan Coal Mine also explains the problem in this way.

Now, the revolutionary workers of Kailuan Coal Mine have a clearer understanding that in today's world, there is fundamentally no such thing as a classless production. Improving coal production is not purely an economic matter, but an important part of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, seizing the revolution and promoting production must not forget the struggle against class enemies.

How was coal production boosted?

The anarchist problem in the Majiagou Mine of the Kailuan Mining Bureau had long been unresolved, affecting both revolution and production, and coal production was in a backward state. Some comrades had thought that anarchism was a trend within the masses, a contradiction within the people; but when anarchism developed to the extent of seriously affecting revolution and production, was it just a trend within the masses?

On March 11 of this year, 10 revolutionary workers, including Cao Weiyou from the No. 2 Tunnel Area of the Majiagou Mine, wrote a big-character poster, proposing a sharp view. They said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Never forget class struggle.' In this period, a small handful of class enemies have been using anarchism as a cover, using counter-revolutionary economism as bait, exploiting the 'selfishness' in our minds, and adopting the strategy of 'luring the masses to the hook' to interfere with our direction of struggle, sabotage proletarian dictatorship, sabotage seizing the revolution and promoting production, sabotage socialist construction, and sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment of 'preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people,' and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." They appealed to all the workers in the mine: "We workers listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and want to 'seize the revolution and promote production.' We will not fall for the class enemies' tricks. We will fight against 'selfishness,' insist on the eight-hour workday, criticize reactionary anarchism, and expose the class enemies who use anarchist trends to carry out sabotage activities! Their big-character poster received a wide response from revolutionary workers. The revolutionary committee of the Majiagou Mine firmly supported their initiative and immediately organized all the workers in the mine to discuss and study.

The workers discussed and studied Chairman Mao's teachings on criticizing anarchism, exposed the various manifestations of anarchism in the mine, discussed the harmfulness of anarchism, and dug out the class roots of anarchism. From the height of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, they understood the anarchist problem. Then, the revolutionary committee of the mine mobilized the masses to expose the evil activities of class enemies using anarchist trends to sabotage revolution and production. After the masses exposed, it was those stubborn capitalist roaders, Kuomintang spies, and loyal running dogs of imperialism who, in the situation where the masses hated the revisionist management system, took the opportunity to propose deceptive slogans, incite the masses to rebel against the eight-hour workday, and engage in anarchism. They incited, saying, "Now the workers are in power. Whatever you say, you have to do it. Whatever you want to do, you set the target, set it low, exceed it more, get more rewards, and you don't work, you still get paid." The workers said in their criticism and struggle against these people: "In the past, these people were the running dogs of imperialism and the Kuomintang, using whips and hammers to beat us to work for the reactionaries for more than ten hours a day and still complain about it being too little. Today, they pretend to care for us workers, incite us not to work or work less. Are they really for us workers? No. They want to muddy the water and take the opportunity to sabotage socialist construction, restore capitalism, and make us workers suffer again."

The revolutionary masses of Majiagou Mine received profound education in the face-to-face struggle with class enemies. They said, "The enemy always finds our weaknesses and uses our selfishness to pull us down. We must fight against selfishness and revisionism, overcome anarchism, insist on the eight-hour workday, seize the revolution and promote production." Through solving the anarchist problem, Majiagou Mine broke through the line of defense of class enemies, carried out class struggle, and the production situation changed rapidly. The attendance rate of workers surged to over 90%, the utilization rate of working hours increased significantly, and good deeds of seizing the revolution and promoting production emerged one after another. Since late March, coal production has continuously exceeded the state plan. Majiagou, a backward mine in production, quickly rose to become an advanced mine.

		Dig out revisionism and stride forward

"In essence, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the broad revolutionary people under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's latest instructions have greatly inspired and encouraged the revolutionary workers of Kailuan Coal Mine. The broad revolutionary workers of Kailuan Coal Mine actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call, took the initiative to launch an attack on class enemies, and investigated the sabotage activities of traitors, spies, and stubborn capitalist roaders. They not only wanted to expose the class enemies but also to eliminate the poison of class enemies. They adopted various forms to carry out a great criticism of the revolution.

In their great criticism of the revolution, they connected the current class struggle with the past class struggle, thereby deepening their understanding of the class struggle that is currently taking place. They realized: If you do not know the past, you do not know the present, you do not understand exploitation, you do not understand class struggle, you do not understand revolution, and you will not be able to distinguish right from wrong, friend from enemy. You will not truly understand our responsibilities as the working class in the Cultural Revolution.

In the Kailuan Coal Mine History Exhibition Hall, there is a document from British imperialism to the capitalists, which reads: "... Our strategy is equivalent to showing them one hand holding a stick and the other hand holding sugar. When you want to use the stick, you should adopt an appropriate stern tone; when you use the method of sugar, you can arbitrarily put on a gentle and friendly face." Many old workers of Kailuan Coal Mine have all experienced the counter-revolutionary two-faced methods of class enemies. They recalled the past, thought about the "carrot and stick" policy of China's Khrushchev and his agents in Kailuan, and the counter-revolutionary revisionist "control, card, fine, and punishment," "bonus as the flag," "material incentive," and other things, which aroused great indignation. They said, this is a replica of the "carrot and stick" policy of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries before liberation. We workers are the masters of the state, and mining for the revolution is our responsibility. They use the price of doing one thing and getting two or three cents to "stimulate" us. How despicable they think of us workers! They use this method to buy us to forget the poor people in the world and forget socialism. This is a bloodless killing method, more poisonous than inducing people to eat opium and "white powder." Many workers realized that eliminating the poison of counter-revolutionary economism is also a continuation of the long-term class struggle between our proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

Many old workers recalled and compared two social systems, two regimes, two working conditions, and two working attitudes. They wept as they recounted the scenes of the cruel exploitation and oppression suffered by the Kailuan miners before liberation and the miserable lives they led before liberation. They also talked about how, after liberation, they became the masters of the state and produced for the revolution. They said, the socialist principle is "no work, no food." Taking state wages without working is the lazy and good-for-nothing attitude of the bourgeoisie. In the old society, the bourgeoisie exploited us workers by holding the power to print money and lived a parasitic life. We workers never did that. We workers should work consciously for the thorough victory of the Cultural Revolution and for socialism.

After the great criticism of the revolution and recalling the bitterness and sweetness, the working class of Kailuan Coal Mine loved Chairman Mao even more. They decided to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. In the Kailuan mining area, Mao Zedong Thought study classes were universally established. After studying in the classes, many workers had a revolution in their souls. They took the brilliant images of Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, and the Old Man Moving Mountains, which Chairman Mao established in the "Three Old Articles," as examples to learn from. Many workers' attitudes towards production also changed. The high production double pay and various bonuses that revisionism had done were already despised. On some holidays this year, the workers of Kailuan Coal Mine did not rest to produce more coal for the state. In the past, such situations would result in bonuses or pay raises; what should be done today? The revolutionary committee of the Kailuan Mining Bureau let the masses discuss. After the broad workers of Kailuan Coal Mine discussed, they did not want bonuses or pay raises. They said: "We want to think what Chairman Mao thinks and be urgent about what the state and the people are urgent about. We must not let Chairman Mao worry about the coal issue!" This is the driving force, this is the goal of struggle! For Chairman Mao, for the revolution, for the people, they actively work and feel extremely honored!

    革命是带动生产前进的火车头
    从开滦煤矿看：一条阶级斗争的红线贯穿在生产斗争中
    开滦煤矿是我国最大的煤矿之一。
    具有革命斗争传统的开滦煤矿工人阶级，在无产阶级文化大革命中，最坚决地响应伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的战斗号召，身在煤矿，心怀全国，放眼世界，把革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产搞得热气腾腾，煤炭产量不断提高。去年十月份以来，煤炭生产月月上升，高产日一个接着一个。目前，他们正奋战“红五月”，力争全矿务局超额完成国家计划，向毛主席报喜。
    开滦煤矿的生产，在文化大革命中有过起伏；阶级斗争发展的状况影响着它，决定着它，推动着它。它随着革命的前进向上发展着。这又一次证明了伟大导师毛主席的教导：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”。革命是带动生产前进的火车头！
          重　心　放　在　那　里
    煤炭是工业的粮食。煤炭生产关系到我国社会主义建设，关系到城乡人民的生活，关系到无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进行，关系到执行毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大决策。党中央曾号召煤炭工业战线上无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，以国家主人翁的高度责任感，坚决把煤炭生产促上去。
    今年三月，开滦矿务局唐山矿的一些同志，出煤心切，想把多出煤这个问题突出出来。他们拟订了高于国家计划的日产指标，布置了夺取高产的种种措施。一旬过去了，生产的情况并不理想。
    这是怎么一回事？这个矿的革命委员会的同志带着问题，深入井下，听取群众意见。群众说，现在领导上只顾抓高产，忙得喘不过气；阶级敌人钻空子破坏生产，挺神气；干部指挥不动，有怨气；革命群众见领导不抓阶级斗争，生闷气。群众一针见血地提出了问题。这个矿的革命委员会立即召开会议，重温毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，分析了三月份阶级斗争的新问题，特别研究了自从矿里提出高产以后阶级敌人破坏活动的种种情况，决定加强阶级斗争的领导，发动群众大揭阶级斗争的盖子，清查阶级敌人破坏革命和生产的罪行。
    三月下旬的最初几天里，这个矿发起了向阶级敌人进攻的高潮。阶级敌人一揪出来，矿里的歪风邪气立时下降，生产事故减少，革命委员会的权威加强，革命干部积极指挥生产，生产秩序良好，革命群众心情舒畅，抓革命促生产的积极性提高，煤炭产量日见上升，很快就实现了原定超过国家计划的日产指标。群众高兴地说，毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”，果真是如此！
    开滦矿务局唐家庄矿革委会，打算组织科、室干部到第一线去支援生产。有人主张编成一个生产班，说这样做煤炭产量明天就会增加。经过大家讨论，认为不能那样做，因为那是单纯地支援劳动力，是一种人多了生产就会上去的见物不见人的思想的反映。大家认为干部下去首要的任务是突出政治。于是，他们把下去的干部组成了三十个毛泽东思想宣传队，下到生产第一线，同工人一起劳动、一起学习毛主席著作，帮助基层办好毛泽东思想学习班，抓好阶级斗争，搞好革命大批判。他们这样做了，基层的阶级斗争开展了，职工的思想进一步革命化了，几千个职工的生产积极性调动了，生产也就上去了。群众说，这些干部下来帮我们以阶级斗争促生产，可比他们单纯干活强得多。
    在开滦矿区，有很多的事例，生动地体现了阶级斗争同生产之间的辩证关系。
    开滦煤矿革命委员会和支工的解放军同志从实践中体会到，如果把工作重心放在抓高产量上，煤炭产量有时也能上升几天，但不能持续下去，甚至反而低产，那样做很容易重新走上中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义路线的歧途。因此，他们在抓革命促生产时，始终把工作重心放在狠抓阶级斗争上，阶级斗争开展好了，生产也就同时促上去了。
    生产决不是
  纯粹的经济问题
    在文化大革命中，阶级敌人一刻也没有放松在煤炭生产问题上打反革命的鬼主意。开始时，开滦煤矿党内一小撮走资派，曾经挥起掌握在他们手中的“生产”大棒，镇压工人的革命行动。毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报，给开滦煤矿革命工人以无穷的力量，革命工人起来造了他们的反，把他们从领导岗位上拉了下来。以后阶级敌人便变换花招，以破坏煤炭生产来破坏文化大革命。
    一年多来，围绕着生产问题，开滦煤矿的广大革命职工同阶级敌人进行了激烈的斗争，今天，这个斗争仍在持续着。
    一九六七年春天，解放军响应毛主席的伟大号召，来到开滦煤矿帮助无产阶级革命派抓革命促生产，多次受到阶级敌人破坏的开滦煤矿的生产很快上升起来。因此，阶级敌人恨透了解放军。他们深知开滦煤矿每出产一吨煤的政治份量，他们在密室里策划着：“解放军在开滦站得住，就是因为还出煤，只要一不出煤，全矿区的职工和家属就会反对解放军。”他们利用某些群众组织的资产阶级派性，煽动说：“你们不掌权，煤出的再多也没有用。”“你们煤出的多了，×主任就会升官”，“你们不能为他卖命！”开滦矿务局唐家庄矿生产搞得好，煤炭生产月月超额完成计划，是开滦矿区抓革命促生产的一面旗帜。阶级敌人把唐家庄矿看作眼中钉，肉中刺，叫喊唐家庄矿是“顽固堡垒”，发誓一定要“攻破”。他们造谣惑众：“有人要封井口”，阻止工人下井上班。他们煽动绞车房、水泵房等生产要害部门的人员脱离岗位，妄图停水停电，破坏矿井，置生产于瘫痪状态。他们挑唆武斗，冲击矿区破坏生产。
    面对着阶级敌人的破坏，开滦煤矿的工人阶级毫不动摇，坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席制定的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，坚持业余闹革命。他们懂得在这场无产阶级同资产阶级的大搏斗中，多生产一吨煤，就会给战斗中的无产阶级增添一份物质力量。他们从无产阶级的政治出发，从国家全局出发，肩负起了革命和生产的两副重担。他们顶邪风，破恶浪，同阶级敌人进行着针锋相对的斗争，表现了对毛主席无限的忠诚，表现了中国工人阶级的崇高品质。在那时候，开滦煤矿的绝大部分工人一直坚守着生产岗位。许多老工人说：“毛主席号召我们抓革命，促生产，离开了生产岗位，就是离开了毛主席的革命路线。”有些生产部位人手不够，他们就一顶二，一顶三地干。绞车房、水泵房的革命工人们奋不顾身地开动机器连续顶班。一些老工人说：“敌人煽动停工，我们就要高产，为毛主席争气，为煤炭工人争光！忠不忠，看行动，我们多出一吨煤就是对毛主席多尽一分忠！”下班后，许多老工人自动地到未上班的阶级弟兄家去，说明井下的情况，揭露敌人的谣言，动员阶级兄弟们回到井下。有的生产部位没有人指挥，一些老工人自动地站了出来，向大家说：不管是那个组织的，咱们工人都要做听毛主席话的无产阶级革命派，咱们要落实毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示。他们用自己的模范行动带动大家一起干。那时候，唐家庄矿掘进二队有四十多人八天未上班，但是他们仍然超额十一米完成国家计划。这个矿在击退了阶级敌人的冲击以后煤炭生产又一再上升，月月超额完成国家计划，一直保持着抓革命促生产的红旗。开滦矿务局的其他矿的煤炭生产也在同阶级敌人反复较量中逐渐提高上来。
    林副主席说：“无产阶级和资产阶级这两个阶级的矛盾、对立、对抗、斗争，成为我们全部的政治生活、社会生活的一个总根源。”开滦煤矿生产斗争的实践也是这样说明问题的。
    现在，开滦煤矿的革命工人，更加清楚地认识到，现今世界上，根本没有什么超阶级的生产，提高煤炭生产决不是纯粹的经济仗，而是无产阶级同资产阶级阶级斗争的一个重要部分。在文化大革命运动中，抓革命促生产，就一定不要忘记对阶级敌人的斗争。
    煤炭生产是怎样跃上去的？
    开滦矿务局马家沟矿的无政府主义问题，长期未得到解决，革命和生产都受到影响，煤炭生产处于落后状态。有些同志曾认为无政府主义是群众中的一种思潮问题，是人民内部矛盾；但是，无政府主义发展到影响革命和生产的严重程度，仅仅只是群众中的一种思潮问题吗？
    今年三月十一日，马家沟矿掘进二区曹维友等十位革命工人，写出大字报，提出了尖锐的看法。他们说，毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”，这个时期以来，一小撮阶级敌人正以无政府主义作掩护，以反革命经济主义作诱饵，利用我们头脑中的“私”字，采取“引诱群众上钩”的策略，来干扰我们斗争的大方向，破坏无产阶级专政，破坏抓革命促生产，破坏社会主义建设，破坏毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略部署，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。他们向全矿职工倡议：我们工人阶级最听毛主席的话，要
  “抓革命，促生产”，决不上阶级敌人的当，要狠斗
  “私”字，坚持八小时工作制，批判反动的无政府主义，把利用无政府主义思潮搞破坏活动的阶级敌人挖出来！他们的大字报引起革命职工广泛的响应，马家沟矿革命委员会坚决支持他们的倡议，立即发动全矿职工座谈讨论。
    职工们在座谈中学习了毛主席有关批判无政府主义的论述，大摆了无政府主义在矿上的种种表现，大论了无政府主义的危害性，大挖了无政府主义的阶级根源，从两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的高度认识了无政府主义问题。接着，矿革命委员会发动群众揭露阶级敌人利用无政府主义思潮破坏革命和生产的罪恶活动。经群众揭发，就是那些顽固不化的走资派、国民党特务和帝国主义的忠实走狗们，在群众憎恨修正主义管理制度的情况下，借机提出迷惑人心的口号，煽动群众造八小时工作制的反，去搞无政府主义。他们煽动说，现在工人掌权了，说怎么办，就得怎么办，想干多少活，就订多少指标，订低点，多超额，多得奖，你们不干活也得发给工资。工人们在批判斗争这些家伙时说：“过去这些人是帝国主义、国民党的爪牙，拿皮鞭、铁锤打着我们每天给反动派干十几个钟头还嫌干的少，今天他们倒装出为我们工人着想的样子，挑唆我们不干活、少干活，他们真是为我们工人阶级吗？不是。他们是想把水搅浑，借机破坏社会主义建设，复辟资本主义，叫我们工人再吃二遍苦。”
    马家沟矿的革命群众，在同阶级敌人面对面的斗争中受到深刻的教育。他们说，敌人专找我们的弱点，利用我们的私心，拉我们下水，我们一定要斗私批修，克服无政府主义，坚持八小时工作，抓革命促生产。马家沟矿通过解决无政府主义问题，突破了阶级敌人的防线，开展了阶级斗争，生产形势迅速发生变化，职工出勤率猛增到百分之九十以上，工时利用率大大提高，抓革命促生产的好人好事不断涌现，三月下旬以来，煤炭生产不断超额完成国家计划。马家沟这个生产上的后进矿，迅速跃升为先进矿。
      挖掉修正主义，阔步前进
      “无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席的这个最新指示，给开滦煤矿的革命职工以极大的启发和鼓舞。开滦煤矿的广大革命职工，积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，主动向阶级敌人展开进攻，清查叛徒、特务和顽固不化的走资派的破坏活动。他们不但要把阶级敌人揪出来，还要肃清阶级敌人的流毒，他们采用种种形式广泛地开展了革命的大批判。
    他们在进行革命大批判时，把现实的阶级斗争同过去的阶级斗争联系起来，从而加深了对今天正进行着的阶级斗争的理解。他们体会到：不知道过去，就不知道今天，就不懂得剥削，就不懂得阶级斗争，就不懂得革命，也就容易是非不清，敌我不分，也就不会真正懂得我们工人阶级在文化大革命中的责任。
    在开滦煤矿矿史展览馆里，有一份英帝国主义给资本家的文件，上面写道：“……我们的策略等于让他们看到一手持棍，另一手持糖。当你要使用棍子的时候，你应当采用适当的强硬的腔调；当你施展用糖的手段时，你可以随意装出柔和友好的面孔来。……”开滦煤矿的许多老工人，都曾领教过阶级敌人的这种反革命两面手法。他们回忆过去，想想中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在开滦搞的一套“管卡扣罚”、“奖金挂帅”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义的东西，激起了无比的义愤，他们说，这是解放前帝国主义和国民党反动派“糖棍政策”的翻版。我们工人阶级是国家的主人，为革命挖煤是我们的责任，他们用干一件事奖两毛三毛的价钱来“刺激”我们，他们把我们工人阶级看得多么下贱！他们用这种办法收买我们忘记天下穷人，忘记社会主义，这是杀人不见血的手段，比诱人吃大烟、“白面”还毒。许多工人认识到，肃清反革命经济主义的流毒，也是我们无产阶级同资产阶级长期阶级斗争的继续。
    许多老工人回忆对比了两种社会制度，两种政权，两种劳动条件，两种劳动态度。他们一字一泪地诉说了解放前开滦矿工们遭受反动派残酷剥削和压迫的情景，以及矿工们在解放前过的“叫花子”的悲惨生活。他们还讲述解放后成了国家主人翁，为革命而生产的心情。他们说，社会主义原则是“不劳动不得食”，拿着国家工资不劳动，是资产阶级好吃懒作的“二流子”作风。在旧社会，资产阶级靠他们掌着印把子剥削我们工人，过着寄生虫式的生活，我们工人阶级从来不干那种事，我们工人阶级应为文化大革命的彻底胜利、为着社会主义而自觉地劳动。
    经过革命大批判，经过忆苦思甜，开滦煤矿的工人阶级更加热爱毛主席了。他们决心要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。在开滦矿区，普遍办起了毛泽东思想学习班，经过学习班学习，许多职工在灵魂深处爆发了革命。他们把毛主席在“老三篇”中树立的光辉形象：张思德、白求恩、老愚公，当做学习的榜样。许多工人对待生产的态度也发生了变化，过去修正主义搞的什么高产双薪，什么五花八门的奖金，已经受到唾弃。今年有些节日，开滦煤矿的工人们为了给国家多出煤，不肯休息。过去遇到这种情况是要发奖或者加薪的；今天怎么办？开滦矿务局革命委员会让群众去讨论。开滦煤矿的广大职工同志们讨论以后，既不要奖，也不要加薪，他们说：“我们是想毛主席所想，急国家和人民所急，决不能因为煤炭问题，叫毛主席他老人家操心！”这就是原动力，这就是奋斗目标！为毛主席、为革命、为人民积极的劳动，他们感到无比的光荣！
