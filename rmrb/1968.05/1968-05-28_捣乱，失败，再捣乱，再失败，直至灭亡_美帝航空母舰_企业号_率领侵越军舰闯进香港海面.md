As the U.S. imperialists take various measures to intensify the Vietnam War, the U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Enterprise," stained with the blood of the Vietnamese people, on the morning of May 24, brazenly led four other U.S. warships into Hong Kong waters. Commander of the U.S. First Aircraft Carrier Task Force, Epps, also arrived in Hong Kong aboard this aircraft carrier. This is the fourth time this year that U.S. nuclear-powered warships have entered Hong Kong, once again indicating that the Johnson administration is increasingly using Hong Kong as a base for its escalation of the Vietnam War and its threats of war against our country.

Accompanying the "Enterprise" into Hong Kong were the destroyers "Evertsen," "Cassard," "Henderson," and the armed transport ship "Bexar." Including the missile destroyer "Jouett," the fast combat support ship "Sacramento," and the coastal defense ship "Minnesota" already docked in Hong Kong, a total of eight U.S. warships were gathered in Hong Kong waters on May 24.

This entry of the "Enterprise" into Hong Kong reflects the U.S. imperialists' increasingly rampant use of Hong Kong as a base for their nuclear-powered warships. Since the U.S. nuclear submarine "Halibut" first entered Hong Kong in 1964, the number of U.S. nuclear-powered warships using Hong Kong as a base has increased year by year: two in 1965, three in 1966, four in 1967, and already four in the first four months of 1968.

It must be pointed out that the frequent military activities of U.S. aircraft carriers and other warships in Hong Kong not only serve the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression in Vietnam but also pose a serious threat to the security of our country. In 1966, the U.S. imperialists planned and colluded with British imperialists and other accomplices to hold a so-called "Sea Imp" military exercise in the South China Sea, which was a ploy to threaten war against China and Vietnam. The large number of U.S. ships participating in this exercise all used Hong Kong as their gathering base. The British Wilson government, instead of stopping the U.S. imperialists' increasingly brazen use of Hong Kong as a base for escalating the Vietnam War and threatening war against the Chinese people, not only did not stop it but also shamelessly colluded with and supported it. The British Deputy Commander of the Far East Fleet, Edward Ashmore, also arrived in Hong Kong on the same day. As early as when the U.S. nuclear submarine "Halibut" first entered Hong Kong in 1964, the then British naval commander in Hong Kong openly declared that Hong Kong would welcome U.S. warships at any time, whether they were nuclear submarines or aircraft carriers. Recently, after this newspaper exposed in detail the news that the U.S. imperialists are stepping up their use of Hong Kong as a base for their Vietnam War activities, a spokesman for the Hong Kong government immediately jumped out to cover up the U.S. imperialists' evil activities in Hong Kong, attempting to deny the facts.

The patriotic people of Hong Kong angrily condemn the U.S. imperialists' brazen use of Hong Kong to provoke war against the Vietnamese people, the Chinese people, and the people of Southeast Asia.

They pointed out: If the British Wilson government and the Hong Kong government insist on following the U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression and war, continue to collude with and support the U.S. imperialists in using Hong Kong as a base for military aggression, and insist on being enemies of the Chinese people and the people of Hong Kong to the end, they will definitely meet a bad end. They expressed their determination to respond to the great call of Chairman Mao, together with the people of the motherland and the people of the world, to launch a sustained and fierce attack on our common enemy, the U.S. imperialists and their accomplices, and will not allow the U.S. imperialists to use Hong Kong as a base for their military aggression.

    捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡
    美帝航空母舰“企业号”率领侵越军舰闯进香港海面
    新华社香港二十七日电　正当美帝国主义采取种种措施强化侵越战争的时候，沾满越南人民鲜血的美国核动力航空母舰“企业号”，二十四日清晨率领另外四艘美国侵略军舰，公然闯进香港海面。美国第一航空母舰舰队司令埃普斯也乘这艘航空母舰到香港活动。这是今年一月以来美帝国主义核动力军舰第四次开进香港，又一次表明，美国约翰逊政府正变本加厉地利用香港作为它扩大侵略越南战争和对我国进行战争威胁的活动基地。
    随同“企业号”一起开到香港的，还有驱逐舰“埃珀森号”、“骚色兰号”、“亨德森号”和武装运输舰“比克沙号”。连同原来停泊在香港海面的导弹驱逐舰“焦特号”、快速战斗补给舰“萨克拉门托号”和海岸防卫舰“明尼汤卡号”在内，二十四日共有八艘美国军舰集结在香港海面。
    这次“企业号”进驻香港，反映了美帝国主义正日益猖獗地使用香港作为它核动力军舰的活动基地。自从美国核潜艇“海龙号”在一九六四年首次开进香港后，美国核动力军舰利用香港作为活动基地的次数逐年增加，计为一九六五年两艘，一九六六年三艘，一九六七年四艘，而一九六八年还不到五个月，先后已有四艘美国核动力军舰开进香港。
    必须严正指出，美国航空母舰和其他侵略军舰经常在香港进行军事活动，不仅是为美帝国主义的侵越战争服务，而且是对我国安全的严重威胁。一九六六年美帝国主义策划并纠集英帝国主义和其他帮凶，在中国南海举行的一次所谓“海上顽童”军事演习，就是玩弄对中国和越南进行战争威胁的把戏。参加这次演习的大批美国舰只，就是以香港作为集结基地的。英国威尔逊政府对美帝国主义越来越猖狂地利用香港作为扩大侵略越南战争和对中国人民进行战争威胁的活动基地，不但不加以制止，反而肆无忌惮地加以纵容和相互勾结。英国驻远东海军副司令爱德华·阿什莫尔也在同一天赶到香港活动。早在一九六四年美国核潜艇“海龙号”首次开进香港时，当时的英国驻香港海军司令就公然叫嚷香港任何时候都欢迎美国军舰，不管是核潜艇还是航空母舰。最近本社以大量事实揭露美帝国主义加紧利用香港作为侵越战争活动基地的消息发表后，港英当局发言人也马上跳出来，为美帝国主义在香港的罪恶活动遮遮掩掩，妄图抵赖。
    香港爱国同胞愤怒谴责美帝国主义利用香港对越南人民、中国人民和东南亚人民进行赤裸裸的战争挑衅的罪行。
    他们纷纷指出：英国威尔逊政府和港英当局如果一意孤行，追随美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，继续纵容和勾结美帝国主义利用香港作为军事侵略活动基地，坚持与中国人民和香港同胞为敌到底，是决没有好下场的。他们表示一定要响应伟大领袖毛主席的伟大号召，同祖国人民和世界人民一道，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻，决不容许美帝国主义利用香港作为它进行军事侵略活动的基地。
