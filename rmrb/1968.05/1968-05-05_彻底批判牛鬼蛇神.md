Thoroughly Criticize the Monsters and Freaks

At a time when China's national economy faced temporary difficulties and when imperialists, revisionists, reactionaries, and domestic reactionaries launched a chorus of anti-China propaganda, the Chinese Khrushchev came out and shouted: "The emergence of some bourgeois elements in society is nothing to be afraid of. There is no need to fear the spread of capitalism." He then put forward the capitalist black goods of "three independences and one contract." Following this, monsters and freaks emerged in droves, causing chaos everywhere. He used "there is no need to fear" to encourage class enemies to attack socialism and to carry out "peaceful evolution." Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao said: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all monsters and freaks must be criticized, and they must not be allowed to spread freely." We must follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao and thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev and all monsters and freaks.

　　彻底批判牛鬼蛇神
    中国赫鲁晓夫在我国国民经济遭到暂时困难，帝、修、反和国内反动派掀起反华大合唱高潮的时候，出来大叫：“社会上产生一些资产阶级分子，并不可怕。不要怕资本主义泛滥。”并且抛出了“三自一包”的资本主义黑货。接着，牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼，闹得乌烟瘴气。他就是这样用“不要怕”，鼓励阶级敌人向社会主义进攻，搞“和平演变”。我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席说：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”我们要遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫和一切牛鬼蛇神。
