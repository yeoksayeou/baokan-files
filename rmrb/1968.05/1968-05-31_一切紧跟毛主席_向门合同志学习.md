Follow Chairman Mao in Everything
—Learn from Comrade Men He

“Think of Chairman Mao in everything, submit to Chairman Mao in everything, follow Chairman Mao in everything, and do everything for Chairman Mao.” This is the heroic oath of the good cadre Men He, who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line. Comrade Men He, with his lifelong struggle and practice, has set a brilliant example for us to follow Chairman Mao in everything.

Our great teacher, Chairman Mao, is the most outstanding leader of the contemporary proletariat and the greatest genius of our time. Chairman Mao has pointed out the direction of victory for us and opened up the road to victory. Following Chairman Mao means victory. This is an unshakable truth verified by hundreds of millions of people in their long revolutionary struggles. “Follow Chairman Mao in everything” is the guiding principle for our proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses, and it is also the necessary path for the growth of heroic models and communist warriors.

“Follow Chairman Mao in everything,” most importantly, means to follow Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the struggle between the two lines is the concentrated expression of class struggle. The struggle over the line is the most profound class struggle, and awareness of the line struggle is the most fundamental class consciousness. Whether or not one follows Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line is the key to carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and ensuring that our country will never change color. It is also an important criterion for judging whether a person is a genuine proletarian revolutionary.

Chairman Mao teaches us: “It is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind. There is no room for compromise on the question of line.”

Comrade Men He deeply understands this. In the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines since the founding of the nation, he has always stood on the side of Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line. He resolutely fought back the rampant attacks of the rightists, bravely exposed the plot of the Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism with his “three freedoms and one contract,” and strongly resisted the bourgeois reactionary military line of the revisionist traitors Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan. He resolutely supported the occupation of the cultural front of the troops by Mao Zedong Thought. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Comrade Men He again followed Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment, resolutely defended Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, resolutely supported the broad leftist masses, and waged a tenacious struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line.

Every revolutionary cadre and comrade should, like Comrade Men He, with deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, “always stand guard and fight for Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line.”

At present, we are at a crucial moment in seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines is more complex and profound. The handful of diehard capitalist-roaders within the Party, as well as the unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, are stirring up a rightist reversal wind. This is the counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line against Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, and it is the counterattack of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes against the proletariat. The proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses should take the firm defense of Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line and the resolute elimination of the interference of bourgeois reactionary ideologies from the right and the ultra-“left” as actual actions of “following Chairman Mao in everything.”

Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line has nurtured and tempered countless communist warriors like Comrade Men He. Countless heroic models like Comrade Men He, with their selfless and fearless struggles, have ensured the implementation of Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line.

Learn from Comrade Men He, follow Chairman Mao in everything, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    一切紧跟毛主席
    ——向门合同志学习
    本报评论员
    “一切想着毛主席，一切服从毛主席，一切紧跟毛主席，一切为着毛主席。”这是无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部门合同志的英雄誓言。门合同志以他一生的斗争实践，为我们树立了一个“一切紧跟毛主席”的光辉榜样。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席，是当代无产阶级最杰出的领袖，是当代最伟大的天才。毛主席为我们指引了胜利的方向，开辟了胜利的道路。紧跟毛主席就是胜利。这是亿万群众在长期的革命斗争实践中所证实的颠扑不破的真理。“一切紧跟毛主席”，这是我们无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的行动准则，也是英雄模范人物和共产主义战士成长的必由之路。
    “一切紧跟毛主席”，最重要的，就是要紧跟毛主席的革命路线。在无产阶级专政条件下，两条路线的斗争，是阶级斗争的集中表现。路线斗争是最深刻的阶级斗争，路线斗争觉悟是最根本的阶级觉悟。是不是紧跟毛主席的革命路线，是能不能将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底、保证我们的国家永不变色的关键问题，是衡量一个人是不是真正的无产阶级革命派的重要标志。
    毛主席教导我们：“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”
    门合同志深深懂得这一点。在建国以来两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，他一贯站在毛主席的革命路线一边。他坚决地反击了右派分子的猖狂进攻，勇敢地揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫推行“三自一包”、复辟资本主义的阴谋，有力地抵制了反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿的资产阶级反动军事路线，坚决地拥护毛泽东思想占领部队的文化阵地。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，门合同志又紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决捍卫毛主席的革命路线，坚决支持左派广大群众，同资产阶级反动路线进行了顽强的斗争。
    每一个革命干部和革命同志，都应当象门合同志那样，怀着对毛主席、对毛泽东思想深厚的无产阶级感情，“时刻为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗”。
    当前，我们正处在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻。两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争更加复杂，更加深刻。党内一小撮顽固不化的走资派以及叛徒、特务，没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子刮起的一股右倾翻案风，就是资产阶级反动路线向毛主席革命路线的反扑，就是资产阶级和一切剥削阶级向无产阶级的反扑。无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，应当把坚决捍卫毛主席的革命路线，坚决排除来自右的和极“左”方面的资产阶级反动思潮的干扰，坚决粉碎右倾翻案妖风，作为“一切紧跟毛主席”的实际行动。
    毛主席的革命路线，哺育和锻炼了千千万万门合式的共产主义战士。千千万万的门合式的英雄模范，又用自己的无私无畏的斗争，保证了毛主席的革命路线的贯彻执行。
    向门合同志学习，一切紧跟毛主席，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
