Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary and production situation in Liaoning Province, an important industrial base in Northeast China, is excellent and getting better and better.

Currently, from Shanhaiguan to the Yalu River, from the coast of the Bohai Sea to the plains of Liaoning, the tide of revolutionary criticism is surging higher and higher, and the waves of revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination are surging forward. Out of the four districts, ten cities, and forty-two counties in the province, except for a few counties, all have achieved revolutionary unity or reached an agreement on revolutionary unity. Including the steel city of Anshan, a number of cities and counties have successively established revolutionary committees. Revolutionary committees in factories, enterprises, schools, and rural people's communes are emerging one after another. The great mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's thoughts is flourishing throughout the province. The proletarian consciousness and the consciousness of class struggle and two-line struggle of the people have reached an unprecedented height, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has deeply entered the hearts of the people. Under the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, industrial and agricultural production in the province is booming.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people in Liaoning Province have responded to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "concern yourselves with state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." They have raised the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries" and launched a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, such as the Chinese Khrushchev, and their agents in Northeast China and Liaoning Province, achieving one victory after another. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people have resolved to thoroughly criticize, overthrow, and expose the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, and to completely eliminate all the poisonous influence of their counter-revolutionary revisionism.

In the fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people in Liaoning Province have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Revolutionary mass organizations have jointly held classes to study Chairman Mao's thoughts and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In Shenyang City, such classes jointly held by various revolutionary mass organizations are held at all levels and everywhere, becoming more and more numerous and better and better. According to incomplete statistics, the various types of classes to study Chairman Mao's thoughts held in cities and countryside across the province have reached 465,900 sessions, with 11,650,000 people participating in the study. Many of these classes have consistently regarded revolutionary criticism as the main course, turning the classes into a stronghold for continuous attacks on class enemies and effectively promoting revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To correctly handle the issue of cadres is a key problem in implementing the three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary unity, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of each unit. It must be resolved." The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people in Liaoning Province have followed Chairman Mao's teachings and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's policy on cadres. They have actively and enthusiastically helped revolutionary cadres to draw a clear line between themselves and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the reactionary bourgeois line, and bravely stood up for revolution. Now, more and more revolutionary cadres who have made mistakes have returned to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, creating favorable conditions for the implementation of the three-in-one combination.

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary people deeply understand that Liaoning is an important industrial base of the motherland, shouldering the heavy task of supporting the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the motherland. They have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and used revolution to lead production. Since this year, the steel city of Anshan, the coal city of Fushun, and the coal and electricity city of Fuxin have all continuously reported double victories in revolution and production. The production of steel, coal, electricity, machinery, fertilizers, and daily light industrial products in the province has gradually increased, with some products seeing a significant increase in output. The volume of railway and highway transportation and the throughput of ports have shown significant improvements. The countryside is also thriving. Poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres are investing all their energy into spring plowing and sowing with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," determined to build on the great harvest of last year's agricultural production and strive for an even greater harvest this year.

Facing this excellent situation, the broad revolutionary masses and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in cities and countryside across Liaoning Province remain sober-minded and never forget class struggle. They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to grasp the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, advance victoriously, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　革命大批判洪流一浪高过一浪，革命大联合和革命三结合热潮汹涌澎湃，工农业生产蒸蒸日上。广大军民决心继续狠抓阶级斗争，乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利
    新华社沈阳四日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，我国东北重要工业基地辽宁省，革命和生产形势一派大好，越来越好。
    目前，从山海关到鸭绿江，从渤海之滨到辽北平原，革命大批判的洪流一浪高过一浪，革命大联合和革命三结合的热潮汹涌澎湃，滚滚向前。全省四个专区、十个市、四十二个县，除个别县外，都实现了革命的大联合或达成了革命大联合的协议。包括钢都鞍山在内的一批市、县，先后成立了革命委员会。工厂、企业、学校、农村人民公社等基层单位的革命委员会，正在联翩出现。全省城乡活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动蓬勃发展，人民群众的无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟空前提高，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线深入人心。在无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，全省工农业生产蒸蒸日上。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，辽宁省的广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，响应伟大领袖毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大号召，高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在东北地区和辽宁省的代理人，发起了猛烈的进攻，取得了一个又一个的胜利。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众在这场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命中，下定决心，一定要把中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人批深批透，斗倒斗臭，彻底肃清他们所散布的一切反革命修正主义流毒。
    在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，辽宁省广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，各革命群众组织联合举办毛泽东思想学习班，落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。在沈阳市，这种各革命群众组织联合举办的毛泽东思想学习班，层层办，处处办，越办越多，越办越好。据不完全统计，全省城乡举办的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，已达四十六万五千九百多期，有一千一百六十五万多人参加了学习。许多学习班始终把革命的大批判当作主课，使学习班成为向阶级敌人持续进攻的坚强阵地，有力地推动了革命大联合和革命三结合。
    毛主席教导我们：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”辽宁省的广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，遵照毛主席的教导，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，积极热情地帮助广大革命干部同党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动路线划清界线，勇敢地站出来革命。现在，越来越多的犯错误的革命干部已经回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，为实现革命三结合创造了有利的条件。
    广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众深深地认识到，辽宁是祖国的重要工业基地，肩负着支援祖国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的重大任务。他们坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，用革命统帅生产。今年以来，钢都鞍山、煤都抚顺以及煤电之城阜新，都不断传来革命、生产双胜利的捷报。全省钢铁、煤炭、电力、机械、化肥、日用轻工业品等的生产，都逐步上升，有些产品的产量有较大幅度的增长。铁路、公路运输量和港口的吞吐量，有显著的提高。广大农村也是一派兴旺景象。贫下中农和革命干部，正以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，热火朝天地投入春耕春播，决心在去年农业生产获得大丰收的基础上，再接再厉，夺取今年更大的丰收。
    在一派大好形势面前，辽宁城乡广大革命群众和人民解放军指战员，保持清醒的头脑，不忘阶级斗争。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，继续狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
