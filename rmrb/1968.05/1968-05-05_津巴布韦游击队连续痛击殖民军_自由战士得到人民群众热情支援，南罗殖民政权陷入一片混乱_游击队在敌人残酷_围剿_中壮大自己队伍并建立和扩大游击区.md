Zimbabwean guerrillas have recently intensified their armed struggle in the northern mountainous regions and the Zambezi Valley of Southern Rhodesia, striking heavy blows against the colonial forces and throwing the colonial regime into chaos.

According to a report from the New China News Agency on May 4, the Zimbabwean freedom fighters, who took up arms against the white colonial regime of Southern Rhodesia two years ago, have been strengthening their armed struggle in the vast mountainous and forested areas of Makuti, Kariba, Chiredzi, Sinoia, Karoi, Lomagundi, Chipinge, Bindura, and Darwin. They frequently appear on the transportation lines, planting mines, blowing up bridges, and ambushing the white colonial troops. After nearly two years of arduous work, the freedom fighters have not only won the support of the broad masses of the people but have also grown their ranks and expanded their guerrilla zones despite the enemy's brutal "extermination" campaigns.

Recently, the Zimbabwean freedom fighters, with the support of the people, have launched widespread attacks, inflicting heavy losses on the Southern Rhodesian colonial troops and the South African mercenaries. This offensive was launched after the Southern Rhodesian white colonial authorities brutally killed several Zimbabwean freedom fighters in early March. The guerrillas operating in the Zambezi Valley initiated the attacks, which quickly spread to the areas north and northeast of Salisbury, between Mazoé and Chipinge. From March 17 to 21, in just five days, the guerrillas killed 39 colonial troops, wounded over 50, and destroyed three enemy armored vehicles. On March 22 and 23, the guerrillas engaged the enemy in the Hurungwe region, killing 11 and wounding many more. On the night of March 26, they killed five more enemy soldiers and wounded eight in the Chipinge mountains.

In April, the Zimbabwean freedom fighters intensified their attacks, dealing heavy blows to the 2,000 reinforcement troops and a large number of South African mercenaries sent to the north for "extermination" operations. At the beginning of the month, they killed six colonial military officers in Karoi, about 100 miles northwest of Salisbury. They then killed and wounded a large number of enemy troops in the Dande area, including 42 South African mercenaries. In an ambush near Mazoé, about 50 miles northeast of Salisbury, they killed 72 enemy soldiers. On April 7, the guerrillas killed 62 enemy troops, including four white officers, in an ambush at Mamati. On April 9, they fought an all-night battle with the enemy in the Muwimbi Mountains, leaving 16 enemy bodies behind. On April 11, the guerrillas ambushed an enemy convoy in the Umvukwe region east of the Zambezi Valley, killing 14 enemy troops. On April 13, they killed 26 enemy troops, including two South African mercenaries, in Banket, about 50 miles northwest of Salisbury.

The guerrillas often choose to launch surprise attacks on the enemy at night, at dusk, or when the enemy troops leave their camps for patrols, catching the enemy off guard. During the battles, the guerrillas received enthusiastic support from the broad masses of the people, who risked their lives to provide food and shelter for the guerrillas. Many young people joined the guerrilla ranks.

The British newspaper *The Scotsman* acknowledged in a report on April 18 that the Zimbabwean freedom fighters "have too many fighters for the Rhodesian regular army to handle" and that the "freedom fighters' weapons and combat skills have improved." The newspaper also stated that the guerrillas receive substantial support from the local residents in terms of food, shelter, and intelligence. The South African radio station was also forced to admit that the guerrillas are disciplined, have combat capabilities, and are a "well-trained force."

According to reports, the Southern Rhodesian colonial troops sent to "exterminate" the guerrillas not only fail to gain the support of the people but also face growing anti-war sentiments among the African soldiers within their ranks. Due to the African soldiers' refusal to fight against their black brothers, a large number have been arrested. *The Scotsman* worriedly noted, "If this dissatisfaction among African soldiers becomes widespread, it will not only greatly reduce the infantry strength of the Rhodesian army but also create other dangers."

The widespread attacks by the Zimbabwean guerrillas have sent the Smith colonial regime into a state of panic. In mid-March, on the day the guerrillas launched their attacks, the colonial authorities hastily canceled military leave and dispatched large numbers of police to cinemas, nightclubs, and bars across Salisbury to find soldiers enjoying themselves and order them back to their camps. They then urgently mobilized large numbers of white local militia, air force volunteers, police reserves, and 350 white mercenaries who had previously wreaked havoc in the Congo (Kinshasa) to the front lines to fight against the guerrillas.

The Smith colonial regime also carried out mass arrests in the guerrilla zones and established so-called "protection committees" in various places, attempting to control and monitor the local people and cut off their ties with the guerrilla fighters.

　　津巴布韦游击队连续痛击殖民军
　　自由战士得到人民群众热情支援，南罗殖民政权陷入一片混乱
　　游击队在敌人残酷“围剿”中壮大自己队伍并建立和扩大游击区
    据新华社四日讯　在两年前拿起枪杆子向南罗得西亚白人殖民政权发起攻击的津巴布韦自由战士，最近在南罗得西亚北部的山区以及赞比西河谷广大地区，加强开展武装斗争，狠狠打击敌人，使殖民政权陷入一片混乱。
    津巴布韦自由战士在一九六六年四月在南罗得西亚首都西北的锡诺亚打响了争取民族独立的武装斗争的第一枪后，就在南罗得西亚北部的马库蒂、卡里巴、奇伦杜、锡诺亚、卡罗伊、洛马贡迪、锡波利洛、宾杜拉和达尔文山一带辽阔的山区和丛林里建立了游击区。他们经常出没在交通线上，埋地雷，炸桥梁，伏击白人殖民军。经过近两年的艰苦工作，自由战士不仅深得广大人民群众的拥护和支持，而且在敌人的残酷“围剿”中，不断壮大自己队伍，建立并扩大了游击区。
    最近，津巴布韦自由战士在人民群众的支持下接连广泛出击，给南罗得西亚殖民军和南非帮凶军以沉重的打击。这次攻势是在三月初南罗得西亚白人殖民当局残暴杀害几名津巴布韦自由战士后发动的。在赞比西河谷活动的游击队首先发起攻击，随后战斗迅速扩及到索尔兹伯里以北和东北部的马佐埃和锡波利洛之间的广大地区。游击队从三月十七日到二十一日的短短五天中，就打死南罗得西亚殖民军三十九人，打伤五十多人，击毁敌军装甲车三辆。三月二十二日和二十三日，游击队在胡隆格韦地区同敌人交战，打死敌军十一名，打伤多人。二十六日晚上，又在锡波利洛地区的山里，打死敌军五名，打伤八人。
    四月份，津巴布韦自由战士又加紧出击，狠揍赶到北部进行“围剿”的两千南罗得西亚增援部队和大批南非帮凶军。月初，他们在索尔兹伯里西北一百多英里的卡罗伊打死了六名殖民军军官，接着又在丹德地区杀伤了大量敌人，其中包括四十二名南非帮凶军；在索尔兹伯里东北约五十多英里的马佐埃附近山区的一次伏击中，又打死敌军七十二名。四月七日，游击队在马马蒂齐进行的另一次伏击中，打死六十二名敌军，其中包括四名白人军官。四月九日，游击队在穆维韦曼辛比山同敌军进行了一个通宵的激烈战斗，敌人在丢下了十六具尸体后狼狈逃窜。四月十一日，在赞比西河谷以东的乌姆武克韦地区，游击队伏击了殖民军的一支车队，打死敌人十四名。四月十三日，游击队在索尔兹伯里西北五十英里的班克特，击毙二十六名敌军，其中包括两名南非帮凶军。
    游击队经常选择在晚上、黄昏以及敌军离开兵营出来巡逻的时候，对敌人发动突然袭击，打得敌人晕头转向。游击队在战斗中得到了广大人民群众的热情支援，人民冒着生命危险给游击队安排食宿。许多青年人参加了游击队。
    英国《苏格兰人报》在四月十八日的一篇报道中承认，津巴布韦自由战士“投入战斗的人数太多，以致于罗得西亚正规军无法应付”，“自由战士的武器和作战技术也有了改进”。这家报纸还说，游击队在粮食、掩蔽和情报方面得到当地居民的巨大支持。南非电台也不得不承认，游击队纪律严明，有作战能力，是一支“经过良好训练的部队”。
    据报道，被派到游击区“追剿”的南罗得西亚殖民军队，不仅得不到群众的支持，而且殖民军队中的非洲士兵日益增长反战情绪。由于非洲士兵拒绝同自己的黑人兄弟作战，已有一大批人被捕。《苏格兰人报》忧心忡忡地说：“如果非洲人士兵中的这种不满变得普遍起来，这不仅会大大减少罗得西亚陆军中的步兵兵力，而且还会造成其他的危险。”
    津巴布韦游击队的广泛出击，使南罗得西亚史密斯殖民当局惊慌万状。三月中旬，在游击队发起攻击的当天，殖民当局慌忙紧急宣布取消部队休假，并派出大批警察到索尔兹伯里全市的电影院、夜总会和酒吧间，寻找正在寻欢作乐的士兵，要他们立即回营报到；随后还急忙抽调大批白人地方军、空军志愿后备队、警察后备队以及三百五十名曾在刚果（金）为非作歹的白人雇佣军，派到前线同游击队作战。
    史密斯殖民政权还在游击区进行大逮捕，并在各地成立所谓“防护委员会”，妄图用这些方法来控制和监视当地群众，切断他们同游击战士的联系。
