The student movement is part of the overall people's movement. The surge in the student movement inevitably promotes the overall rise of the people's movement.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has inspired the world's revolutionary people with the courage to struggle and win. The powerful student movement in Western Europe and North America is fiercely assaulting the reactionary rule of monopoly capital.

The massive student movement is gradually merging with the workers' movement, showing that the people of Western Europe and North America are awakening to a new consciousness.

Just as the political and economic crises of the entire capitalist world are accelerating, a powerful progressive student movement is rising in Western Europe and North America. The recent student struggles in the heart of the capitalist world against the decadent bourgeois educational system, for democratic rights, and against the reactionary domestic and foreign policies of the ruling clique are surging and developing rapidly. This is an important sign of the growing awakening of the people of Western Europe and North America, and a prominent manifestation of the increasing instability of the international monopoly bourgeoisie's reactionary rule.

The powerful progressive student movement in Western Europe and North America is gradually merging with the workers' movement, forming a massive tide that is fiercely assaulting the reactionary rule of monopoly capital. Faced with the heroic struggles of students and workers, the reactionary ruling clique is panicked and at a loss, collaborating with various traitors and scabs to sabotage and suppress the people's struggles. However, any desperate struggles of the reactionaries can only promote the awakening of the people.

The rapid development of the progressive student movement in Western Europe and North America is inseparable from the immense influence of the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which has shaken the world. This great revolution has inspired the fighting will of the people of Western Europe and North America and accelerated the spread of the invincible thought of Mao Zedong in these regions. Among the young students in these areas, the number of people studying Chairman Mao's works and the "Little Red Book" is increasing. In the demonstration marches, one can often see people holding high the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, holding high the red "Little Red Book," and wearing Chairman Mao badges. More and more people are expressing their desire to follow the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao.

Our great teacher Chairman Mao pointed out: "No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the forward march of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur and will certainly be victorious, whether sooner or later." The people of Western Europe and North America want revolution. The people's movement in Western Europe and North America will certainly continue to rise. No matter how the reactionaries of various countries play their counter-revolutionary tricks, or how the modern revisionists conspire to sabotage, they cannot stop this surging revolutionary tide.

    学生运动是整个人民运动的一部分。学生运动的高涨，不可避免地要促进整个人民运动的高涨。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命激发了世界革命人民敢于斗争敢于胜利的英勇气概
    西欧北美学生运动猛烈冲击垄断资本反动统治
    声势浩大的学生运动正在同工人运动逐步汇合，显示西欧北美人民处在新的觉醒中
    正当整个资本主义世界的政治危机和经济危机加速发展的时候，强大的进步学生运动正在西欧和北美兴起。资本主义世界心脏地区的学生最近掀起的反对腐朽的资产阶级教育制度，争取民主权利，反对统治集团反动的内外政策的斗争，风起云涌，迅猛异常。这是西欧、北美人民日益觉醒的一个重要标志，是国际垄断资产阶级反动统治日益不稳的一个突出表现。
    西欧、北美声势浩大的进步学生运动正在同工人运动逐步汇合，形成一股巨大的潮流，猛烈地冲击着垄断资本的反动统治。在学生和工人的英勇斗争面前，反动统治集团惊慌不安，手足失措，它们正在伙同形形色色的叛徒、工贼对人民的斗争进行破坏和镇压。但是，反动派的任何垂死挣扎，都只能促进人民的觉醒。
    西欧、北美进步学生运动的迅速发展，是和震动世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大影响分不开的。这场史无前例的伟大革命鼓舞了西欧、北美人民的战斗意志，加速了战无不胜的毛泽东思想在西欧、北美的传播。在这些地区的青年学生中，学习毛主席著作和《毛主席语录》的人正在不断增加。在示威游行队伍中，可以经常看到有人高举伟大领袖毛主席的画像，高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》和佩戴毛主席像章。越来越多的人表示要走毛主席指引的革命道路。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席指出：“不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”西欧、北美人民要革命。西欧、北美的人民运动一定会不断高涨。不管各国反动派怎样玩弄反革命的两面手法，也不管现代修正主义者怎样阴谋破坏，都不可能阻挡这个汹涌澎湃的革命潮流。
