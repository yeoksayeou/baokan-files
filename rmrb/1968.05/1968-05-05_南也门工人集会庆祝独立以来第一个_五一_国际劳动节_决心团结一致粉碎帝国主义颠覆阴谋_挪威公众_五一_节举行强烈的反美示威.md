South Yemen workers held a rally to celebrate the first May Day since the country's independence. Workers gathered on May 1st in front of the headquarters of the South Yemen Workers' Union in Aden. The President of South Yemen, Qahtan al-Shaabi, attended the rally and delivered a speech.

Representatives from various South Yemen mass organizations spoke at the rally, denouncing the imperialists' plots to subvert the People's Republic of South Yemen.

Abdul-Kader Amin, Chairman of the South Yemen Workers' Union, stated in his speech that Britain is attempting to continue its economic pressure on South Yemen. The people of South Yemen will not yield to this pressure. They will take practical actions to counter imperialism.

Zainab Sakkaf, a representative of the South Yemen Women's Association, said that imperialism will not stop its efforts to sabotage the liberation struggle and revolutionary movements. She called on the women and people of South Yemen to unite and take action to foil the shameful plots of imperialism and reactionary forces against the Republic and the South Yemen revolution. The crowd repeatedly chanted, "Down with imperialism!" and "Long live workers and peasants!"

    OSLO, May 4 (Xinhua) — About 4,000 people in Norway held strong anti-American protests on May Day.

    The demonstrators carried portraits of Marx, Lenin, Chairman Mao, and Chairman Ho Chi Minh.

    They held a protest demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy. Their slogans included "Fight against U.S. imperialism," "Fully support the National Liberation Front (of South Vietnam)," "U.S. out of Vietnam," and "Norway out of NATO."

    In the evening, about 1,000 young people went to the Oslo prison to demand the immediate release of a young man who was recently arrested during an anti-American protest. Many young people fought with the police.

    During the struggle, some young people collectively read aloud quotations from Chairman Mao.

    People in other Western European countries, such as France, Italy, and the Netherlands, also held demonstrations and parades on May Day.
