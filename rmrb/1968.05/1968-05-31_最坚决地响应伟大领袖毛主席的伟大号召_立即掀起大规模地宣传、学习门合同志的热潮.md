Most decisively respond to the great leader Chairman Mao's great call and immediately launch a large-scale campaign to promote and study Comrade Meng Hao-zhen!

Revolutionary committees, revolutionary preparatory committees, and leading organs in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as party committees of the People's Liberation Army's various headquarters, military branches, and units, have respectively made decisions or issued notices, requiring that through learning from Comrade Meng Hao-zhen, the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought be held even higher, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line be resolutely executed and bravely defended, and Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments be closely followed. In the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, new merits must be made for the people.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 30th, revolutionary committees, revolutionary preparatory committees, and leading organs in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have recently made decisions or issued notices, calling on the broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres in various places to resolutely implement the order personally approved by the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group. They are to immediately launch a large-scale campaign to promote and study Comrade Meng Hao-zhen, who is an "exemplary cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." Through this learning campaign, the class consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses will be further enhanced, Mao Zedong Thought will be better studied and applied, Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments will be closely followed, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions will be fully implemented. Efforts will be made to strive for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

By the 30th, revolutionary committees, revolutionary preparatory committees, and leading organs in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Guizhou provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have made decisions or issued notices to resolutely implement the central order and extensively and deeply launch a campaign to learn from Comrade Meng Hao-zhen.

The decisions and notices from these provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions point out that our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao personally approved the order issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, posthumously awarding Comrade Meng Hao-zhen the honorable title of "exemplary cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." This is a major event in the political life of the entire Party, the entire army, and the revolutionary people of the entire country. This is the greatest concern, the greatest education, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest spur for the people of the entire country by the great leader Chairman Mao. Comrade Meng Hao-zhen is a communist warrior nurtured by the great thought of Mao Zedong, a shining example of a Party cadre continuing the revolution under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and a heroic figure infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in this era. At this crucial moment when we are striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, extensively and deeply launching a campaign to learn from Comrade Meng Hao-zhen will further push the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought across the country to a new stage. It will greatly enhance the class struggle and line struggle consciousness of the people across the country, and cultivate tens of thousands of successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This has extremely great significance for ensuring that the proletarian dictatorship in our country remains unshakable for generations to come.

The decisions or notices from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions call on the broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres to most actively and enthusiastically respond to the call of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, learn from Comrade Meng Hao-zhen, learn from his lofty qualities of being infinitely loyal to the people, infinitely loyal to the Party, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; learn from his revolutionary spirit of resolutely executing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; learn from his excellent style of studying Chairman Mao's works with great eagerness and insistence on studying and applying them; learn from his communist style of "selflessly serving others"; learn from his close connection with the masses and his constant maintenance of the simple and frugal character of the working people. Like Comrade Meng Hao-zhen, strive to "always think of Chairman Mao, always follow Chairman Mao, always follow Chairman Mao, and always serve Chairman Mao."

The decisions or notices from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions require that various places make full use of various propaganda tools and adopt various propaganda methods to deeply penetrate into the grassroots and rural areas, extensively propagate, praise, sing, perform, and draw the order issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and the heroic deeds of Comrade Meng Hao-zhen, making them known to every household and deeply ingrained in people's hearts. This will further promote the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new high tide. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes should take learning from Comrade Meng Hao-zhen's glorious deeds and lofty qualities as an important learning content, with everyone learning from the hero, finding gaps, criticizing and repudiating selfishness and revisionism, overcoming selfishness and establishing public spirit, and carrying out ideological revolutionization.

The decisions or notices from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions say that learning from Comrade Meng Hao-zhen should be closely combined with the current class struggle situation, enhance class struggle consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness, resolutely oppose right-opportunism, right-capitulationism, and right-splittism, thoroughly smash the rightist reversal wind, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, expose hidden traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The decisions or notices from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions point out that Comrade Meng Hao-zhen's lofty qualities concentrate the heroic essence of the people's army. His appearance once again shows that the peerless People's Liberation Army of China is the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the great wall of the Chinese people. Therefore, in the campaign to learn from Comrade Meng Hao-zhen, the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people" raised by Chairman Mao should be held high, and the movement of supporting the army and loving the people should be further carried out. Trust the People's Liberation Army, rely on the People's Liberation Army, learn from the People's Liberation Army, and continuously strengthen the unity between the military and the people and between the military and the government.

The decisions or notices from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions require that members of revolutionary committees at all levels and broad revolutionary cadres should first seriously learn from Comrade Meng Hao-zhen, further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the construction of revolutionary committees, carry out ideological revolutionization and organizational revolutionization, and "organize a revolutionary leadership cadre that is connected with the masses." This will make the revolutionary committee a command post that stands at the forefront of class struggle and two-line struggle, with proletarian politics in a prominent position.

Xinhua News Agency, May 30th: Party committees of various headquarters, military branches, and units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have respectively made decisions on resolutely implementing the order of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and learning from Comrade Meng Hao-zhen, the "exemplary cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." They require that the broad masses of cadres and soldiers in their subordinate units, especially leading cadres at all levels, most enthusiastically respond to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, resolutely implement the order of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and immediately launch a large-scale campaign to extensively and deeply promote and study Comrade Meng Hao-zhen. Through learning from Comrade Meng Hao-zhen, the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought will be held even higher, Mao Zedong Thought will be studied and applied, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line will be resolutely executed and bravely defended, Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments will be closely followed, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions will be fully implemented. In the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, new merits will be made for the people.

The great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin personally approved the conferring of the honorable title on Comrade Meng Hao-zhen, greatly inspiring the broad masses of cadres and soldiers in various places. The party committees of various headquarters, military branches, and units, as well as the party committees of the Lanzhou, Beijing, Shenyang, Jinan, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Chengdu, Kunming units, and the Xinjiang and Tibet Military Regions, upon receiving the central order, immediately held party committee meetings or expanded party committee meetings, conducted serious study, and quickly made decisions on learning from Comrade Meng Hao-zhen, which were issued to their subordinate units.

The decisions of various headquarters, military branches, and units point out that Comrade Meng Hao-zhen is an outstanding representative of thousands and tens of thousands of revolutionary cadres who are infinitely loyal to the people, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and infinitely loyal to the Party's line. Learning from Comrade Meng Hao-zhen, the most fundamental thing is to: first, learn from his lofty qualities of being infinitely loyal to the people, infinitely loyal to the Party, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, forge a red heart that is most loyal to Chairman Mao, and be revolutionary to the end of one's life, following Chairman Mao all one's life. Second, learn from his thorough revolutionary spirit of always, consciously, and firmly standing on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the intense struggle between the two lines, resolutely executing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, with a firm stance and clear banner, fighting for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line while alive and sacrificing for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line while dead. Third, learn from his excellent style of studying Chairman Mao's works with great eagerness and insistence on studying and applying them, actively applying Mao Zedong Thought, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings word for word, and implementing Chairman Mao's instructions item by item. Fourth, learn from his communist spirit of "selflessly serving others," "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, doing a lifetime of revolution, transforming one's thoughts for a lifetime, being the people's ox for a lifetime, and pulling the revolutionary cart for a lifetime, all the way to communism. Fifth, learn from his close connection with the masses and his constant maintenance of the simple and frugal character of the working people, always preserving revolutionary youth, and continuously making new merits for the people.

The decisions of various headquarters, military branches, and units require that in the campaign to learn from Comrade Meng Hao-zhen, the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought must be held high, closely combined with the current situation of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, closely combined with the tasks and ideological reality of the units, and focus on the word "loyalty" to the great leader Chairman Mao, and the word "use" to Mao Zedong Thought. This will further launch a new high tide of the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, strengthen two-line struggle education, and enhance the class struggle and line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of cadres and soldiers.

The decisions of various headquarters, military branches, and units emphasize that Comrade Meng Hao-zhen's life of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the best example for our broad cadres to continue the revolution under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Leading cadres at all levels must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, seriously learn from Comrade Meng Hao-zhen, and lead the way in learning well and learning to a high level. In accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching of "not eating old capital but creating new merits," leading cadres at all levels should better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, criticize and repudiate selfishness and revisionism, consciously transform their worldview, and continuously enhance their line struggle consciousness. They should resolutely execute and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and build the leading cadre team into a strong fighting collective that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The decisions of various headquarters, military branches, and units require that leading cadres at all levels must take learning from Comrade Meng Hao-zhen as the current center of ideological and political work, grasp it firmly, do it well, and achieve results, making this learning truly become a powerful driving force for "grabbing the revolution, promoting production, promoting work, and promoting preparedness." Political organs at all levels should strengthen the leadership of learning, grasp the dynamics of learning, timely summarize experiences, and propose and solve new problems in response to the active thoughts of the masses, promoting the in-depth development of this learning campaign. Various units should, in combination with their own situations, extensively organize various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes and hold thematic reporting meetings and discussion meetings. The unit's broadcasts, blackboard newspapers, wall newspapers, and cultural activities should give full support, creating a mass campaign to learn from Meng Hao-zhen.
