The slogan "Economize to Make Revolution" is of great significance to our proletarian revolutionary faction in maintaining a spirit of hard work and simplicity, and in exercising power for the proletariat. It is a matter of great importance for the long-term development of socialist construction in our great motherland. Therefore, we must resolutely follow the great teachings of Chairman Mao and work together to achieve this.

"Every drop makes an ocean, every grain of rice adds up." These three letters from readers once again emphasize the importance of saving every bit. If we ignore the importance of saving every bit and are extravagant in everything we do, who knows how much of the state's wealth will be wasted!

To "economize to make revolution," we must have a revolutionary spirit and revolutionary style. As long as something aligns with the spirit of economizing to make revolution, we must resolutely and persistently carry it out. We must firmly resist and oppose all forms of wastefulness. Only by being meticulous in every detail can we tap into potential and achieve great results. Let us learn from the spirit of these units, which focus on the big picture but start with small details, truly achieving the goal of "saving every penny for the war and revolutionary cause, for our economic construction." — Editor

In the past, whenever coal was burned, we would check it again to pick out any usable coal pieces, big or small. For a long time, we thought that was the end of it, that we had already achieved the maximum economy.

Is that really the case? No! There is still potential for more savings.

Chairman Mao teaches us to "economize to make revolution," so we must resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's teachings. I thought about the six stove pipes in our shop. Whenever hard coal is burned, they would crackle and pop, scattering coal dust everywhere, which we would throw away with the ash. I also thought about how, when water is poured over the burned coal ash, it sometimes turns black, indicating that there is still unburned coal inside.

So, I and my comrades put the burned coal ash in a basin, added water, and repeatedly stirred and washed it. Sure enough, a thick layer of black coal dust settled at the bottom of the basin. When burned in a blowtorch, it burned even more vigorously than second-grade coal. Originally, our two blowtorches required over a hundred pounds of good coal each day. Now, the coal dust recovered from the six stove pipes is enough to use. In March, we burned over eight tons of coal. In April, because we recovered the coal dust, we only used over six tons. Through this experiment, I deeply felt that to economize and make revolution, we must first revolutionize our own thinking, break the "maximum economy" mindset, and continue to innovate and progress.

### 打破节约到顶的思想

　　打破节约到顶的思想
    “要节约闹革命”，是关系到我们无产阶级革命派永远保持艰苦朴素作风，为无产阶级掌好权、用好权的大事情，是我们伟大祖国社会主义建设的百年大计，千年大计。因此，我们应该坚决遵循毛主席的伟大教导，齐心协力来做。
      “滴水汇成河，粒米凑成箩”。这三封读者来信，再次说明了一点一滴节约的重要性。如果忽略一点一滴地节约，干什么事都大脚大手，那就不知道有多少国家的资财会白白地浪费掉！
    “要节约闹革命”，就要有革命化的思想，革命化的作风。只要符合节约闹革命的精神的事情，就要有决心，有毅力地坚持做下去。对于铺张浪费的现象，要坚决抵制，坚决反对。只有处处精打细算，才能挖掘潜力，做出巨大的成绩来。让我们学习这几个单位从大处着眼，小处着手的精神，真正做到“节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业，为着我们的经济建设”。编者
    过去，凡是烧过的煤，我们都重新检查一遍，把可用的大小煤核捡出来。在相当长的时间里，我们总认为这样做再没有什么浪费了，已经节约到顶了。
    真是这样吗？不！节约还是有潜力可挖的。
    毛主席教导我们“要节约闹革命”，我们就要坚决按照毛主席的教导办事。我想到平时我们店里所用的六个筒子炉，一遇到烧硬煤，就霹雳啪啦乱爆煤末，这些煤末跟着炉灰一起扔了。我还想到：平日把水泼在烧过的煤灰上，有时呈现一片黑色，这不是说明里边还有没有烧尽的煤吗？
    于是我就和同志们把烧过的煤灰放在盆里，加上水，反复地搅和冲洗，盆底果然沉淀了一厚层黑糊糊的煤末，放进吹风灶烧用，比次烟煤火头还旺。本来我店两个吹风灶每天要用好煤一百多斤，现在六个筒子炉回收下来的煤末就足够用了。三月份我们烧煤八吨多，四月份因为回收了煤末，只用了六吨多。通过这次试验，我深深体会到，节约闹革命，首先必须革自己思想的命，打破节约到顶的思想，才能不断有所创造，有所前进。
