Workers and students support each other, fight side by side, powerfully impacting the rule of the French reactionary bourgeoisie.

A wave of strikes by French workers is sweeping across the country, driven by an unprecedented surge in the student movement. Thousands upon thousands of French workers have risen up to occupy major factories, detain managers and directors, and hoist red flags on factory buildings. French students continue to occupy eighteen universities across the country.

Workers and students support each other, fight side by side, powerfully impacting the rule of the French reactionary bourgeoisie.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The student movement is part of the entire people's movement. The rise of the student movement inevitably promotes the rise of the entire people's movement."

Over the past half month, students in Paris and across France have been waging a heroic struggle to reform the corrupt educational system and against government repression of the student movement. This has greatly promoted the struggle of the French working class.

On May 16, tens of thousands of workers at France's largest automobile monopoly, the state-owned Renault Automobile Company, rose up to occupy all the company's factories across the country, hoisted red flags, declared an indefinite strike, demanded wage increases, and protested against government policies. In the town of Flins west of Paris, 10,000 workers participated in the occupation of the local Renault factory. In Sandouville, 4,500 workers joined in. In Cléon, 5,000 workers occupied the factory and detained the Renault factory manager and several executives in the office.

In Nantes, 2,000 workers at the aircraft manufacturing plant of the French Southern Aircraft Company continued to occupy the factory and detained the director. In Bayonne, workers and technicians at the weapons factory also occupied the factory on May 16 and detained the general manager. Striking workers also occupied the naval shipyard and workshops in Le Havre. Workers in private enterprises in Gironde, Bordeaux, Orléans, Bayonne, Elbeuf, and other places also occupied factories and detained the managers of these factories.

Meanwhile, the strike by airport workers plunged Paris International Airport into chaos, forcing international passengers transiting through Paris to take the train to Brussels Airport. The strike by Paris newspaper delivery workers severely affected the distribution of French newspapers.

Workers at the French Broadcasting and Television Company, controlled by the French government, decided to hold a general meeting on May 17 to discuss an indefinite strike. French railway workers are also preparing to launch a nationwide general strike. The tide of strikes is rapidly rising.

French students enthusiastically support the workers' struggle. About 1,000 students from the University of Paris walked twenty miles from Paris University to a Renault factory in the Paris suburbs on the evening of May 14 to support the workers' just struggle. The students sang the "Internationale" and chanted slogans such as "Long live the workers' struggle!" The "Occupation Committee of the University of Paris" expressed support for the workers' occupation of factories and called on students to "combine with the factories already occupied in their regions."

Since French Prime Minister Pompidou, under the immense pressure of the united struggle of students and workers, ordered the police to withdraw from the University of Paris on May 13, Paris students, teachers, and workers have been continuously occupying the University of Paris, discussing various issues related to the reform of the educational system day and night. Students in other parts of France have also followed the example of Paris, occupying seventeen other universities in France. Students and teachers in various places have established temporary organizations to manage the affairs within the school. Paris students also occupied the French National Theater, expressing their intention to turn it into a place for the people to gather.

Currently, the movement is spreading to middle schools across the country. In Saint-Brieuc, Rennes, and other cities, middle school students have established "Action Committees."

The rising tide of the workers' and students' movements in France has made the French government panic. The French government issued a statement on the evening of May 16, shouting that the French "government cannot tolerate" actions aimed at "damaging the order of the Republic," and that the "government has the duty" to "oppose excessive actions and subversion," openly threatening the French people. French Prime Minister Pompidou held an emergency meeting on May 17 with the Minister of Armed Forces Pierre Messmer, Minister of the Interior Christian Fouchet, and the heads of the gendarmerie and police to discuss countermeasures.

In the past two days, in addition to deploying tens of thousands of police and 60,000 gendarmes in Paris, the French government has also mobilized 12,000 gendarmerie reserves and dispatched large numbers of police from other provinces to deal with the students and workers in Paris.

In the face of the rising tide of the workers' and students' movements, the French revisionist group could not wait to jump out and publicly criticize the masses' revolutionary actions, serving the French ruling class. The organ of the French revisionists, *L'Humanité*, once again attacked the Paris student movement on May 16. Some union leaders of the French revisionists openly shouted that they would "not recognize" and "not approve" the workers' occupation of factories. This once again exposed the shameful faces of the French revisionist group as traitors and scabs.

    工人和学生互相支持，并肩战斗，有力地冲击反动统治
    法国工人罢工怒潮席卷全国
    法修集团公然跳出来指责群众革命造反行动，暴露出工贼嘴脸
    新华社十七日讯　巴黎消息：在法国空前高涨的学生运动的推动下，法国工人阶级掀起了席卷全国的政治和经济罢工怒潮。成千成万的法国工人奋起占领了一批大工厂，扣留了厂长和经理，在厂房上升起鲜艳的红旗。法国学生继续占领着全法国十八个大学。
    工人和学生互相支持，并肩战斗，有力地冲击着法国垄断资产阶级的统治。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席早已指出：“学生运动是整个人民运动的一部分。学生运动的高涨，不可避免地要促进整个人民运动的高涨。”
    半个月来，巴黎以至全法国的学生，为了改革腐朽的教育制度和反对政府镇压学生运动所进行的英勇斗争，大大地促进了法国工人阶级的斗争。
    十六日，法国最大的汽车垄断企业——国营雷诺汽车公司的几万工人，奋起占领了这家公司分布在各地的全部工厂，在厂房上升起红旗，宣布无限期罢工，要求提高工资并抗议政府的政策。在巴黎西边的弗兰市，参加占领当地雷诺工厂的有一万名工人。在桑杜维尔参加占领当地雷诺工厂的有四千五百人。在克莱翁，五千工人占领工厂后把雷诺工厂经理和几个负责人扣留在办公室里。
    在南特，法国南方飞机公司所属的飞机制造厂的二千名工人，继续占领工厂并扣留厂长。在巴荣纳的武器制造厂的工人、技术员，十六日也占领了工厂，并且扣留了总经理。罢工的工人还占领了在勒阿弗尔的海军船坞和工场。纪龙德、波尔多、奥尔良、巴荣纳、埃尔伯夫等地私营企业的工人也纷纷占领工厂，并扣留这些工厂的负责人。
    与此同时，机场职工的罢工使巴黎国际机场陷于混乱，途经巴黎的国际旅客不得不转乘火车转往布鲁塞尔机场。巴黎送报人员的罢工使法国报纸的发行工作受到重大影响。
    法国政府控制的法国广播和电视公司的职工决定十七日召开全体职工大会，讨论无限期罢工问题。法国铁路工人也正在准备发动全国总罢工。罢工的浪潮正在迅速高涨。
    法国学生热情支持工人的斗争。巴黎大学学生约一千人，十四日晚上从巴黎大学走了二十里路来到巴黎近郊的一个雷诺工厂，支持工人们的正义斗争。学生们高唱《国际歌》，高呼“工人的斗争万岁！”等口号。“巴黎大学占领委员会”表示支持工人占领工厂，并且号召学生“同他们所在地区的已经占领的工厂相结合”。
    自从法国总理蓬皮杜在学生工人联合斗争的巨大压力下，不得不在十三日下令警察退出巴黎大学以来，巴黎学生、教师和工人一直占领着巴黎大学，在校园内日以继夜地讨论改革教育制度的各种问题。法国各地的大学生也效法巴黎，占领了法国其他十七个大学。各地学生和教师们都成立了临时机构，自己管理校内的事务。巴黎大学生还占领了法国的国家剧院，表示要把它变为人民聚会的场所。
    目前，运动正在向全国中学发展。在圣布里厄、雷纳和其他城市，中学生已建立起
  “行动委员会”。
    法国工人、学生运动的日益高涨使法国政府惊慌失措。法国政府十六日晚发布一份公告，叫嚷什么法国“政府不能容忍”旨在“损害共和国秩序的行动”，“政府有义务”
  “反对过火行为和颠覆”，对法国人民进行露骨的威胁。法国总理蓬皮杜十七日召集武装部队部部长皮埃尔·梅斯梅尔、内政部长克里斯吉安·伏歇以及宪兵和警察头子举行紧急会议，密商对策。
    法国政府这两天除了出动巴黎几万警察和六万宪兵外，还动员了一万二千名宪兵后备队，并且从外省调集大批警察，来对付巴黎的学生和工人。
    在工人和学生运动日益高涨的形势下，法国修正主义集团迫不及待地跳出来，公开指责群众的造反行动，为法国统治集团效劳。法修的机关报《人道报》十六日又一次攻击巴黎学生运动。法修的一些工会头目则公开叫嚷“不承认”、“不批准”工人占领工厂的行动。这再一次暴露了法国修正主义集团工贼和叛徒的可耻嘴脸。
