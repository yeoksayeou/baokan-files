The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team's art troupe has grown up in the stormy waves of class struggle. It is the messenger on the political front and the light cavalry on the artistic front. It must keep up with the development of the revolutionary struggle, sing along with Chairman Mao's voice, and sing to meet the needs of the revolution. Only in this way can it truly serve as a powerful weapon to "unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and annihilate the enemy."

Through the study of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and over a year of practice, we have the following experience: whether or not to follow the development of the revolutionary struggle to carry out propaganda is an important indicator of whether the troupe is loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art; whether or not to keep up with the development of the revolutionary struggle to carry out propaganda is the key to the success or failure of the troupe's work. On this major issue, we have tasted both bitterness and sweetness.

What kind of "play" should we perform?

Our unit is stationed in Shanghai. Last May and June, with the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide and in Shanghai, our troupe also achieved some success and received a few words of praise. As a result, some comrades became arrogant. They thought: the troupe has made a name for itself and should no longer perform those small programs that follow the situation and are created and performed on the spot. Instead, we should put on a "proper" play. By "proper" play, they meant new equipment, good instruments, large programs, and high skills; without considering the development of the revolutionary struggle, they wanted to put on a "play" that could be performed for three to five years. Once these thoughts of emphasizing art over politics, detaching from the real revolutionary struggle, and pursuing grandeur emerged, the troupe's work was immediately affected: they were reluctant to perform battle-ready small programs, and the so-called high-art large programs could not be performed. The more equipment there was, the more sluggish the actions became. The majority of the troupe's comrades noticed that something was wrong. This was not just a matter of what kind of "play" to perform, but a matter of the entire troupe's direction. Therefore, we organized a study of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." Chairman Mao taught us: "In any class society, any class always puts political criteria first and artistic criteria second." Our mistake was that we fundamentally reversed the relationship between politics and art. Chairman Mao also taught us: "Revolutionary ideological struggle and artistic struggle must serve political struggle, because only through politics can the needs of the class and the masses be concentratedly expressed." The great teachings pointed out an essential question: what are the needs of the class and the masses? We recalled the feedback from the broad audience. They said: "What we want is revolutionary political content and a tense fighting spirit." "We are not here to watch a play, but to receive propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought." "Because your troupe's programs follow the situation closely and have a strong fighting spirit, the audience is large and loves to watch." This is the voice of the revolutionary masses. What they urgently need is not some so-called "exquisite" artistic performance detached from the real struggle, but fighting, revolutionary art that serves proletarian politics. Through our study, we realized that the reason for the emergence of the thought of a "play" that emphasizes art over politics is that the "self" in our minds has not been completely eliminated, we have been poisoned by the reactionary bourgeois artistic thought, and we have deviated from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Revolutionary art propaganda must always highlight proletarian politics and follow the revolutionary struggle closely, creating and performing as we go, singing loudly and marching forward. Now, if someone asks us what kind of "play" we should perform, our answer is: the troupe's "play" should be like a scroll depicting an endless vista, forever following the torrent of revolutionary struggle, constantly adding the waves of a great era.

Is there nothing to sing about or is there too much to sing about?

Last October, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide was excellent, and hundreds of millions of revolutionary people were advancing under the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao. However, at this time, an abnormal phenomenon appeared within our troupe: some comrades engaged in creation suddenly felt that there was nothing to write about, reasoning that: "The situation in Shanghai is developing very quickly, and most units have already achieved revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination according to Chairman Mao's instructions. What else is there to write about?" The faster the situation develops, the more we feel there is nothing to write about. This is obviously a strange logic, but it is a real concern. How to solve it? We re-studied "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." Chairman Mao taught us: "One must go to the masses, must go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers unconditionally and wholeheartedly for a long time, must go to the fiery struggle, must go to the only broadest and richest source, observe, experience, study, and analyze everything, all classes, all masses, all lively forms of life and struggle, all original materials of literature and art, and then it is possible to enter the creative process." The reason we felt empty was not a matter of the speed of the situation's development, but that we lacked actual struggle life.

"Can the troupe also lack 'life'?" Initially, we did not understand. We thought that having or not having "life" was a problem for professional artists and intellectuals, but we ourselves are the children of the working people, soldiers in uniform, how could we lack "life"? We followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "the criterion of truth is only social practice," and moved the troupe into the factory, working, studying, and living with the workers. Soon, we became familiar with the situation, and our feelings blended with the workers. Ten thousand new things appeared before our eyes, and one revolutionary struggle question after another entered our minds. We no longer felt that there was nothing to sing about, but rather that the great struggle life was endless. Only then did we truly understand Chairman Mao's teachings. Revolutionary struggle life is the only source of revolutionary art. If you do not go deep into it, you will not be able to write or sing anything. Therefore, even if we come from the workers and peasants, we still need to live among them. Only by living in the fiery struggle can we always follow the revolutionary situation.

Singing the right song in the right place and choosing good themes to compose new songs

After the troupe returned to the unit, we selected themes from the unit's life and arranged some programs that depict revolutionary soldiers' unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao. However, someone asked: "If we perform only about the army, can we go to the factory or the countryside?" Why was this question raised? The reason is that in the past, we simply understood following the revolutionary situation and adapting to the needs of the masses as just "singing the right song in the right place." Therefore, we adopted the method of singing about winter sowing and spring plowing when we went to the countryside, talking about weaving when we went to the textile mill, and talking about farming when we went to the commune. Of course, this approach is necessary and has its advantages. First, it makes the audience feel familiar and easy to understand; second, it is convenient to carry out targeted propaganda based on specific situations. However, loyalty to Chairman Mao is the first need of the People's Liberation Army and all revolutionary people in the country, the first need of the revolution, and the first need of the times. Therefore, performing programs about the loyalty of army soldiers to Chairman Mao will also be welcomed by the broad revolutionary masses. In this regard, there are successful examples. For example, we have two programs: one is "Praising the Hero Li Wenzhong," and the other is "Chairman Mao Commands Us to Fight." Although they are about the army and singing about battles, because they can show the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the sublime qualities of people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they meet the political needs of the broad revolutionary people and are universally welcomed by the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This shows that if we can select and depict major issues in the revolutionary struggle and typical figures with the characteristics of the times, we will achieve universal educational effects.

Through the study of Chairman Mao's works and a review of past experiences and lessons, we believe: we should both carry forward the spirit of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers with enthusiasm for "singing the right song in the right place" (in conditions where it is possible, such as troupes responsible for fixed-point propaganda, following work, and directly participating in the "Three Supports and Two Militaria" work, all those who can understand specific situations should not give up propaganda that meets the actual work and struggle needs of the time and place), and advocate for "choosing good themes to compose new songs" from the perspective of the overall situation of the revolutionary struggle, grasping the main contradictions and typical figures. Following the revolutionary struggle is to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment; adapting to the needs of the revolutionary masses is not just to meet the general demands of some masses, but also to meet the political needs of the overall interests of the proletarian revolution.

Singing praises to the greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist, our brightest red sun Mao Zedong, singing praises to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and singing praises to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the strongest note of the entire era, the most urgent need of the revolutionary struggle, and the strongest wish of all revolutionary people in China and the world, which is also the most sublime theme that all revolutionary art teams should depict. We must closely revolve around this great theme, go to the revolutionary struggle life where the flowers are in full bloom to select and refine the most expressive themes, strive to create, and sing to our heart's content.

    随毛主席的声音而唱　应革命的需要而歌
    ——学习《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的体会
    中国人民解放军驻上海空军某部毛泽东思想宣传队
    毛泽东思想宣传队文艺小分队是在阶级斗争的暴风雨中成长起来的。它是政治战线上的传令兵，文艺阵地中的轻骑队。它必须紧跟革命斗争形势的发展，随毛主席的声音而唱，应革命的需要而歌。只有这样，才能真正起到“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”的作用。
    通过学习《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》和一年多的实践，我们有这样的体会：愿不愿紧跟革命斗争形势的发展来进行宣传，是考察小分队是否忠于毛主席革命文艺路线的重要标志；能不能跟上革命斗争形势的发展来进行宣传，是小分队工作成败的主要关键。在这一重大问题上，我们曾经尝过几番苦和甜。
    到底该演哪样的“一台戏”
    我们部队驻在上海。去年五、六月，随着全国和上海地区的文化大革命形势的发展，我们小分队也在这时取得了一点成绩，听了几声赞许，于是部分同志的头脑就膨胀起来。有的认为：小分队闯出名了，不能再排那些紧跟形势即编即演的小节目，而要搞出象样的“一台戏”了。所谓象样的“一台戏”，就是装备要新、乐器要好、节目要大、技巧要高；不考虑革命斗争形势的发展，想排“一台戏”就能演它个三、五年。这种重艺术轻政治、脱离现实革命斗争需要和贪大等思想一露头，小分队的工作立即受到影响：战斗性强的小节目不愿演，所谓艺术高的大节目又演不出，装备愈来愈多，行动愈来愈迟缓……。小分队的大多数同志察觉到苗头不对，这不仅是演什么样的“一台戏”的问题，而是整个小分队的方向问题。因此，我们组织学习了《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。毛主席教导我们说：“任何阶级社会中的任何阶级，总是以政治标准放在第一位，以艺术标准放在第二位的。”我们的错误就在于从根本上颠倒了政治和艺术的关系。毛主席又教导说：“革命的思想斗争和艺术斗争，必须服从于政治的斗争，因为只有经过政治，阶级和群众的需要才能集中地表现出来。”伟大的教导提示出一个本质问题：什么是阶级和群众的需要？我们回忆了广大观众的反映。他们说：“我们要的就是革命的政治内容，紧张的战斗气势。”“我们不是看戏，是接受毛泽东思想的宣传。”“因为你们小分队的节目跟形势跟得紧，战斗气息浓，所以观众多，爱看。”这就是革命群众的心声。他们迫切需要的不是什么脱离现实斗争的所谓“精湛的”艺术表演，而是战斗的、为无产阶级政治服务的革命文艺。我们经过学习，才认识到那种重艺术轻政治的“一台戏”思想之所以产生，是因为我们头脑中的“私”字没有除尽，中了资产阶级反动文艺思想的流毒，违背了毛主席的革命路线。革命的文艺宣传，必须时时突出无产阶级政治，步步紧跟革命斗争形势，随编随演，高歌猛进。现在，谁要问我们到底该演哪“一台戏”？我们的回答是：小分队的“一台戏”应该象一幅展望无边的画卷，永远追随着革命斗争的洪流，不断涂抹上伟大时代的浪花。
    是没啥可唱还是唱不完
    去年十月，全国无产阶级文化大革命形势一片大好，亿万革命人民紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署阔步前进。可是这时在我们小分队内部出现了一个不大正常的现象，一些搞创作的同志突然感到没事可写，理由是：“上海市的形势发展得很快，大部分单位已经按照毛主席的指示实现了革命大联合和革命的三结合。再往下去，还有什么文章好做呢？”形势发展得越快，越感到没文章好做，这显然是一种奇怪的逻辑，但又是实际存在的苦恼。怎样去解决？我们重新学习了《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。毛主席教导我们说：“必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去，观察、体验、研究、分析一切人，一切阶级，一切群众，一切生动的生活形式和斗争形式，一切文学和艺术的原始材料，然后才有可能进入创作过程。”我们所以感到空虚，根本不是形势发展快慢问题，而是我们缺少实际斗争生活。
    “小分队也有缺少‘生活’的问题？”开始有些想不通。以为有没有“生活”是那些专业文艺工作者和知识分子们的问题，而我们本身就是劳动人民的子弟，是穿上军衣的工农，怎么会缺少“生活”呢？我们遵照毛主席“真理的标准只能是社会的实践”的教导，把小分队迁进了工厂，和工人同志一起共同学习、共同劳动、共同生活。没有多久，情况熟悉了，感情上和工人同志打成一片了，千万件新生事物呈现在我们的眼前，一个个革命斗争的问题钻进了我们的脑海。我们再也不感到没啥好唱，而是觉得伟大的斗争生活唱不完。直到此时，我们才对毛主席的教导真正有所领悟。革命的斗争生活是革命文艺的唯一源泉，你不去深入地掘取，就什么也写不出、唱不出。所以，即使我们来自工农，也还是需要生活到工农之中，只有生活在火热的斗争之中，才能永远跟着革命形势前进。
    过哪山唱哪歌和选好题材谱新歌
    小分队回部队以后，就在部队生活中选取题材编排了一些表现革命战士无限忠于毛主席的文艺节目。可是有人问道：“都演部队里的事，进工厂、下农村行吗？”为啥会提出这个问题？原因是过去我们把紧跟革命形势和适应群众需要简单地理解为只是“过哪山唱哪歌”。所以就采用了唱过冬播唱春耕和进了纱厂谈织布、走到公社讲种田的办法。当然，这种做法是需要的，有它的好处。第一，能使观众感到亲切易懂；第二，便于依据具体情况进行针对性的宣传。然而，忠于毛主席是人民解放军和全国革命人民的第一需要，是革命的第一需要，是时代的第一需要，因此，演唱部队战士无限忠于毛主席的文艺节目，同样会受到广大革命群众的欢迎。这方面，也有成功的事实。如我们有两个节目：一个是《歌颂英雄李文忠》，一个是《毛主席指挥我们战斗》。虽然都是演的部队里的人，唱的打仗的事，但因为通过它们能表现出毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，表现出用毛泽东思想武装起来的人的崇高品质，这就符合了广大革命人民政治上的需要，受到了工农兵的普遍欢迎。这说明，如果我们能够选取和表现革命斗争的重大问题和具有时代特征的典型人物，是会收到普遍的教育效果的。
    通过学习毛主席的著作，回顾了以往的经验教训，我们认为：既要发扬那种“到哪山唱哪歌”的热情为工农兵服务的精神（在有条件的情况下，如负责定点宣传、跟班劳动、直接参加“三支”“两军”工作的小分队，凡能够了解具体情况的，都不应放弃针对当时当地实际工作斗争需要的宣传），也要提倡从革命斗争形势的全局着眼，抓住主要矛盾和典型人物来“选好题材谱新歌”。紧跟革命斗争形势，就是要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署；适应革命群众需要，也不是简单地满足部分群众的一般要求，还要符合整个无产阶级革命利益的政治需要。
    歌颂当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者、我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席，歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想，歌颂毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是整个时代的最强音，是革命斗争最迫切的需要，是全中国和全世界革命人民最强烈的愿望，也就是我们一切革命文艺工作队伍所要表现的最崇高的主题。我们要紧紧围绕这一伟大主题，到山花烂熳的革命斗争生活中去选取和提炼最富有表现力的题材，努力创作，尽情歌唱。
