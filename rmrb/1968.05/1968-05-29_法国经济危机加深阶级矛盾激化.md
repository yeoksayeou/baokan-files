Recently, the surging waves of people's struggles have swept across the major capitalist countries in Europe and North America. Particularly in France, the unprecedented scale of student movements and worker strikes across the nation have dealt a heavy blow to the French monopolistic bourgeoisie and their reactionary rule. This is a prominent manifestation of the deepening political and economic crisis in France and the unprecedented intensification of class contradictions within the country.

In recent years, as the capitalist world faces a new and severe economic crisis, France's economic situation has also deteriorated. The French ruling class, in order to mitigate the economic crisis and maintain the interests of the French monopolistic bourgeoisie, has intensified its attacks on the French people, making the broad masses of French laborers even more impoverished and sparking increasingly strong dissatisfaction and opposition among the French people.

From 1964 to 1965, France's economy experienced a recession, with the rate of economic growth declining. In 1966, the growth rate of French industrial production was 6.7%. However, by 1967, industrial production had stagnated, with a growth rate of only 2.5%, making it the worst year since the economic crisis swept across Western Europe in 1959. Comparing 1967 with 1966, crude steel production increased by only 0.4%, pig iron by 0.8%, the automobile industry declined by about 2%, and industries such as chemicals and rubber only reached half of the expected growth rate, while the textile industry declined by 5% and the clothing industry by 12%. This year, the capitalist world has seen an unprecedented severe financial crisis and economic crisis, and France's economic situation is also grim. The reasons for France's economic deterioration are, on the one hand, due to the intense competition among imperialist countries for world markets, with French monopolistic enterprises at a disadvantage in terms of technology, management, and products. However, more importantly, it is due to the continuous decline in the living standards of the French people and the shrinking purchasing power, which is entirely the result of the reactionary policies of the French ruling authorities that vigorously maintain the interests of monopolistic capital and strengthen the exploitation of the French people.

To strengthen the power of French monopolistic capital, the French government has adopted measures such as increasing government investment and easing credit to stimulate production. This has led to inflation. In the first three quarters of 1967, the circulation of paper money and bank loans increased by 40% compared to the same period in 1966. At the same time, this has also caused the French government's fiscal budget to have a huge deficit. The fiscal deficit in 1967 reached 7 billion francs. This year, the French government continues to adopt an inflationary policy, and after increasing taxes by 100 billion dollars, it is estimated that there will still be a deficit of about 1.8 billion francs. To increase tax revenue to cover the deficit, and at the same time restrict imports and strengthen exports, the French government has implemented the "value-added tax" system since the beginning of this year. This tax includes agriculture, service industries, and retail. The method of taxation is to levy taxes from the raw materials, levy higher taxes on semi-finished products, and levy even higher taxes on finished products based on their value. As a result, French laborers have to bear an even heavier tax burden.

The French ruling class is also vigorously encouraging French monopolistic capital to merge with medium and small enterprises to strengthen their power. It is estimated that there were 1,500 mergers last year. With the intensification of competition in the world market, such mergers are currently accelerating. Due to mergers, a large number of enterprise managers, technical personnel, and workers have been laid off. According to reports in French newspapers, from the beginning of 1965 to the beginning of 1967, industrial production increased by 10%, but the number of industrial employees decreased by 0.6%. This indicates that the exploitation of workers by monopolistic capital has greatly intensified.

To strengthen the competitiveness of French agricultural products in the world market and maintain the interests of agricultural monopolistic capital, the French ruling class is also actively encouraging large farms to merge with medium and small farms. This has resulted in a large number of farmers losing their land, with 100,000 laborers migrating from rural areas to cities each year. This process has recently accelerated further, and even the French government recently had to admit that "farmers are abandoning their land at a rate faster than planned."

The French ruling class has also taken measures to restrict wage increases for workers to protect the interests of monopolistic capital. It has changed the social insurance system, increased the amount of social insurance fees paid by employees, and at the same time reduced the amount of social insurance subsidies they receive when they encounter illness or industrial accidents, in order to extract tens of billions of francs to invest in monopolistic enterprises.

The series of reactionary policies of the French ruling class have led to an unprecedented increase in the number of unemployed. By the beginning of this year, the number of unemployed in France had reached 450,000, the highest since World War II. Currently, the number of unemployed is further approaching the 500,000 mark. The characteristics of unemployment in France are that there are increasingly more technical workers, technical personnel, and enterprise managers in the unemployed ranks, and a large number of graduates from institutions of higher learning who cannot find jobs. Even in the officially announced unemployment figures, this part of the unemployed youth is not included. Even those workers who are employed have their actual working hours reduced due to insufficient production by enterprises, and their wage income has significantly decreased.

At the same time, due to inflation and increased taxes, prices have also risen sharply. Even according to the official figures published by the French government, prices rose by 3.5% in 1967. After the implementation of the "value-added tax" at the beginning of this year, prices have generally risen, with some rising by as much as 10%.

Under these circumstances, the living conditions of the broad masses of French laborers are becoming increasingly impoverished, domestic consumption demand is weakening, and this in turn further promotes the decline in industrial production and the increase in the number of unemployed. In this vicious cycle, class contradictions within France have intensified to an unprecedented degree. In recent years, workers' strikes in France have been frequent and developing. French youth students, facing the threat of unemployment upon graduation, are increasingly dissatisfied with France's decadent bourgeois education system and social system. This year, with the further deterioration of France's economic situation and the intensification of the French ruling class's attacks on the French people, under the influence of the developing world revolutionary situation and our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the French working class and youth students have bravely risen up to launch a powerful struggle, pushing the people's revolutionary movement to a new high. The mass struggles of French workers and students are not only a heavy blow to the French ruling class but will also influence the entire Western Europe, powerfully promoting the further development of the people's movement in this region and accelerating the comprehensive collapse of the imperialist system.

    法国经济危机加深阶级矛盾激化
    最近，人民群众斗争的滚滚怒涛，席卷了欧洲和北美的主要资本主义国家。特别是在法国，全国范围内掀起的空前规模的学生运动和工人罢工斗争，给了法国垄断资产阶级及其反动统治以沉重的打击。这是法国政治经济危机日益加深、国内阶级矛盾空前激化的突出表现。
    近几年来，随着资本主义世界面临新的严重的经济危机，法国的经济状况也日益恶化。法国统治集团为了缓和经济危机，维护法国垄断资产阶级的利益，加紧进攻法国人民，使广大法国劳动人民更加贫困，激起了法国人民越来越强烈的不满和反对。
    一九六四年到一九六五年，法国经济出现衰退，经济增长速度下降。一九六六年，法国工业生产增长率为百分之六点七。但是到了一九六七年，工业生产就陷于停滞状态，增长率只有百分之二点五，是从一九五九年西欧普遍发生经济危机以来情况最糟糕的一年。拿一九六七年同一九六六年相比较，原钢生产只增加百分之零点四，生铁只增加百分之零点八，汽车工业下降百分之二左右，化学、橡胶等工业只达到预计增长率的一半，纺织业下降百分之五，服装业下降百分之十二。今年资本主义世界出现空前严重的金融危机和经济危机，法国的经济状况也很不妙。法国经济恶化的原因，一方面固然是由于帝国主义之间争夺世界市场的斗争十分尖锐，法国垄断企业在技术、管理和产品等方面都处于不利的竞争地位，但是更重要的是由于法国人民生活水平不断下降，购买力日益萎缩，而这完全是法国统治当局极力维护垄断资本利益、加强剥削法国人民的反动政策所造成的恶果。
    为了加强法国垄断资本的实力，法国政府采取了增加政府投资和放宽信贷等措施，来刺激生产。这样就造成了通货膨胀。一九六七年头三个季度流通的纸币和银行发放的贷款，比一九六六年同期增加了百分之四十。同时，这也使法国政府的财政预算出现了巨额赤字。一九六七年的财政赤字达七十亿法郎。今年法国政府继续采取通货膨胀政策，在增税一百亿美元之后，预计还将有约十八亿法郎的赤字。为了增加税收弥补赤字，同时限制进口，加强出口，法国政府从今年一月起实行“增值税”制。这种税征收的范围，包括农业、服务性行业以及零售业。征税的方法是从原料起就征税，对半成品征较高的税，对制成品按更高的价值征税。这样做的结果，使法国劳动人民承受了更沉重的捐税负担。
    法国统治集团还竭力鼓励法国垄断资本并吞中小企业，来加强它们的实力。去年据估计就有一千五百起企业合并。随着世界市场上竞争的加剧，这种合并目前正在加速进行。由于合并，大批企业管理人员、技术人员和工人被解雇。据法国报纸报道，在一九六五年初到一九六七年初的两年中，工业生产增加了百分之十，而工业就业人数却减少了百分之零点六。这说明垄断资本对工人的剥削大大加强了。
    法国统治集团为了加强法国农产品在世界市场上的竞争能力，维护农业垄断资本的利益，还积极鼓励大农场并吞中、小农场。这造成了大批农民丧失土地，每年有十万劳动力从农村流入城市。这个过程最近又进一步加速，连法国官方最近也不得不承认“农民以高于计划规定的速度放弃土地”。
    法国统治集团还采取限制工人增加工资的措施，来保护垄断资本的利益。它还改变社会保险制度，增加职工交纳的社会保险费，同时却减少他们在遇到疾病或工伤事故时领受社会保险津贴的金额，以便从中搜括几十亿法郎，用来投资于垄断企业。
    法国统治集团的一系列反动政策，使失业人数空前增加。到今年年初，法国失业人数已经达到四十五万人，是第二次大战以来从未有过的。目前，失业人数又进一步接近到五十万大关。法国失业的特点是：失业队伍中有越来越多的技术工人、技术人员和企业管理人员，并且有大量从高等院校毕业而找不到工作的青年。而在官方宣布的失业数字中，这一部分失业青年还没有包括在内。就是在业的工人，他们的实际工作时间由于企业开工不足也普遍减少，工人的工资收入大大降低。
    同时，由于通货膨胀和捐税增加，物价也急剧上涨。即使根据法国官方公布的数字，一九六七年物价就上涨了百分之三点五。今年年初实行“增值税”以后，物价普遍上涨，有些上涨达百分之十。
    在这种情况下，法国广大劳动人民的生活日益贫困，国内的消费需求减弱，而这反过来又促使工业生产进一步下降，失业人数更加增多。在这样一种恶性循环中，法国国内的阶级矛盾空前激化。近几年来，法国工人的罢工斗争此伏彼起，日益发展。法国的青年学生，面临着毕业即失业的威胁，对于法国腐朽的资产阶级教育制度和社会制度，也越来越不满。今年，随着法国经济状况的进一步恶化，和法国统治集团对法国人民进攻的加紧，在日益发展的世界革命形势和我国无产阶级文化大革命的影响下，法国工人阶级和青年学生英勇地起来展开强大的斗争，把人民革命运动推向新的高潮。法国工人和学生的群众斗争，不仅对法国统治集团是一个沉重的打击，而且必将影响整个西欧，有力地推动这个地区的人民运动的进一步发展，加速帝国主义制度的全面崩溃。
