Palestinian guerrillas are growing stronger in combat and have recently launched three significant large-scale battles, annihilating hundreds of Israeli aggressor troops.

BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) — The "Fatah" Palestinian nationalist organization's "Storm" commando unit has recently been on the offensive, with battles increasing in scale. On May 2, they achieved a major victory south of the Dead Sea, annihilating over seventy Israeli aggressor troops.

This is the third significant large-scale battle in which Palestinian guerrillas have annihilated enemy forces in the past twenty days. Previously, in mid-April, guerrillas annihilated over ninety enemy troops in the Nablus mountain area, and on April 28, they annihilated sixty enemy troops in the town of Umm al-Rashrash in the Negev Desert.

According to the Middle East News Agency, on May 2, the "Storm" commando unit launched a surprise attack on a small Israeli unit of fifteen soldiers in the northern part of Ein el-Rashrash, south of the Dead Sea, completely annihilating the unit.

Israeli armored units rushed to the rescue, but the first armored vehicle triggered a mine. The Israeli aggressors were then met with a fierce assault of hand grenades and machine guns from the guerrillas. Dazed and confused, the Israeli aggressors quickly dispatched three helicopters to indiscriminately drop napalm bombs on the area. However, the guerrillas fought bravely and tenaciously, engaging in four hours of intense combat, killing and wounding over seventy enemy troops, including two high-ranking officers. They also destroyed one half-track vehicle and two jeeps.

After the guerrillas withdrew, Israeli ambulances and helicopters spent the night transporting the dead and wounded Israeli soldiers.

According to another report, during the battle from April 28 to 29, the guerrillas also raised the Palestinian flag over the Besan Valley. This caused the Israeli aggressors to panic, and on the 30th, they dispatched thirty-five aircraft to bomb the area indiscriminately.

　　巴勒斯坦游击队越战越强
　　连续展开三次较大规模战斗歼灭以色列侵略军数百名
    新华社六日讯　巴勒斯坦民族主义组织“法塔赫”所领导的“暴风”突击队最近连续出击，战斗规模越来越大，五月二日又在死海以南一举歼灭以色列侵略军七十多名。
    这是巴勒斯坦游击队在最近二十天来第三次较大规模地歼灭敌军的一次战斗。在这以前的两次大规模战斗是：游击队于四月中旬在纳布卢斯山区歼灭敌军九十多名，四月二十八日又在内格夫沙漠的乌加镇歼灭敌军六十名。
    据中东通讯社报道，五月二日，“暴风”突击队在死海以南的埃因阿鲁兹北部，奇袭了一支由十五个以色列士兵组成的小部队，并在战斗中全歼了这支部队。
    以色列的装甲部队急忙赶来营救，但是，开到这一地区的第一辆装甲车触了雷，以色列侵略军遭到了游击队手榴弹和机枪的猛烈攻击。被打得晕头转向的以色列侵略军又赶紧出动三架直升飞机，疯狂地向这个地区投掷凝固汽油弹。但是，游击队英勇顽强，经过四个小时激烈战斗，打死打伤敌军七十多人，其中包括两名高级军官；还击毁一辆半履带式军车和两辆吉普车。
    在游击队撤离以后，以色列的救护车和直升飞机彻夜在搬运死伤的以色列士兵。
    另据报道，在四月二十八日到二十九日的战斗中，游击队还在贝桑河谷的上空升起了巴勒斯坦旗帜。这使以色列侵略者惊慌万状，三十日连续派了三十五架飞机到这个地区进行狂轰滥炸。
