The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Shaanxi and the broad cadres and soldiers of the Shaanxi Provincial Military Region are filled with joy and revolutionary fighting spirit, celebrating the glorious birth of the Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City Revolutionary Committees. They enthusiastically acclaim another great victory of Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line! They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit cultivated by Mao Zedong in Yan'an, advance with the momentum of victory, develop the excellent situation, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The news of the establishment of the Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City Revolutionary Committees has greatly encouraged the "three supports, two militaries" personnel of the People's Liberation Army fighting on the Guanzhong Plain, the Qinling Mountains, and the banks of the Yan River. In recent days, they have gone deep into factories, villages, offices, and schools, holding meetings with revolutionary masses to celebrate the establishment of the provincial and municipal revolutionary committees, shouting enthusiastically: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

On this joyous day of celebrating the establishment of the Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City Revolutionary Committees, the revolutionary fighters who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Never forget class struggle." They have repeatedly and seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes in the condition of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its leadership of the broad revolutionary masses and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The cadres and soldiers say that the class struggle, the struggle between two lines, and the struggle between two roads in the Shaanxi region fully prove Chairman Mao's great and brilliant thesis. Now, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories. However, the closer we get to complete victory, the more the enemies of the proletariat will try to sabotage and disrupt in various ways. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "The rights obtained by the people must not be allowed to be lost easily; they must be defended by struggle." We must defend the achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the death and defend the newly born proletarian revolutionary power to the death. Firm defenders of Chairman Mao's military line, such as Guo Xiaosi, have expressed that the People's Liberation Army is the pillar of the proletarian dictatorship and the defender of the proletarian revolutionary power. We must strengthen our class struggle awareness a hundredfold, raise our awareness of line struggle, and defend the revolutionary committees born in the storm of class struggle with struggle.

The cadres and soldiers pointed out in their meetings and discussions that we must not become arrogant and complacent because of victory. We must inherit and carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of Yan'an, firmly oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, resolutely repel the rightist reversal wind, and together with the revolutionary masses of the whole province, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, actively and unceasingly launch fierce attacks on the class enemies, and thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev and other top walkers of the capitalist road within the party and their agents such as Liu Lantao, Zhao Shouyi, and Li Qiming in the Northwest and Shaanxi. We must dig out all the traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries hiding in every corner.

In the midst of the joyous shouts celebrating the establishment of the provincial and municipal revolutionary committees, the military representatives participating in various levels of revolutionary committees and the "three supports, two militaries" personnel, reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings on "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses" and his latest instructions on revolutionary committees. They unanimously expressed that in the new situation of seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they will firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, use Chairman Mao's latest instructions to propagate, organize, and arm the masses, strengthen military-civilian unity, further consolidate and develop the great alliance and the three-in-one combination based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly maintain the revolutionary authority of the revolutionary committees, and achieve new victories in seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Cui Xiaotang, the political commissar of the People's Armed Forces Department of Miji County and the chairman of the Miji County Revolutionary Committee, who is praised as the red flag of supporting the left in the Shaanbei Plateau, expressed that he will firmly carry out Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, strengthen the revolutionary construction of the revolutionary committees, bring the People's Liberation Army's active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the four firsts, and carrying forward the fine traditions of the "three-eighths" style into the revolutionary committees, and build the revolutionary committees into battle command posts that hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are revolutionary, and are connected with the masses.

    陕西省和西安市革命委员会成立的喜讯，极大地鼓舞了战斗在关中平原、秦岭山区、延河两岸的人民解放军“三支”“两军”人员。连日来，他们纷纷深入到工厂、农村、机关、学校，和革命群众一起集会，欢庆省、市革委会的成立，纵情高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”

    在庆祝省、市革命委员会成立的欢呼声中，参加各级革命委员会的部队代表和“三支”“两军”人员，重温了毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的教导和关于革命委员会的最新指示，一致表示，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的新形势下，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，用毛主席的最新指示宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，加强军民团结，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上，进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，坚决维护革命委员会的革命权威，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利中立新功。被誉为陕北高原支左红旗的米脂县人民武装部政委、米脂县革命委员会主任崔孝堂表示，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的一系列最新指示，加强革命委员会的革命化建设，把人民解放军活学活用毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风的优良传统带进革命委员会，把革命委员会建设成为高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的、革命化的、联系群众的战斗指挥部。
