The revolutionary committee of Shijiazhuang City's Weidong Garment Factory, with the help of the PLA, has fought against bureaucratism and established the idea of being a servant of the people and a student of the masses. They have united with the people in thought and action.

The revolutionary committee members of Shijiazhuang City's Weidong Garment Factory, under the guidance of the PLA's leftist support personnel, have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on "the reform of state organs, the most fundamental point of which is to connect with the people." In the matter of connecting with the people, they have progressed from merely being physically among the people to truly being with the people in spirit.

From the beginning of its establishment, the Weidong Garment Factory revolutionary committee had seven members, six of whom were not full-time. Usually, except for one member who took turns being on duty in the office to handle daily work, the other members all went deep into the workshops.

After a period of time, the PLA comrades discovered that some committee members, after going down, talked more and did less; some only focused on their own work and could not blend in with the people. They promptly discussed this with the revolutionary committee members, and everyone realized that cadres being physically among the people is only the beginning of connecting with the people, but truly connecting with the people requires being with them in spirit. At the same time, they realized that connecting with the people is a profound ideological revolution, and it is necessary to constantly overcome the obstacles of bourgeois ideology and old habits.

Everyone also realized that one of the fundamental purposes of connecting with the people is to ensure that cadres are always under the supervision of the people, to always maintain the character of the working people, to resist the infiltration of bourgeois and non-proletarian ideologies, to prevent bureaucratism, to prevent revisionism, and to continuously develop and consolidate the revolutionary committee into a strong and powerful command center that emphasizes proletarian politics. To achieve this goal, one must definitely follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, "to be both an official and a common person," to honestly be "a servant of the people," and to respectfully be "a student of the masses."

By comparing themselves with Chairman Mao's teachings, they examined their previous efforts to connect with the people and felt that they had not truly connected with the people in thought. The root cause was that there was still an "official" mentality in their minds. The chairman of the revolutionary committee and revolutionary leading cadre, Xing Baoxi, said: "Originally, I always thought that I was an old cadre, educated by the Party for many years, knowing more principles than the masses, with more work experience, so when I went among the people, I couldn't put down my cadre's airs, learned less from the people, and gave more instructions." The deputy chairman of the revolutionary committee and worker, Wu Ruifen, said: "After becoming deputy chairman, I thought: I must not be high above the people, letting the people say I am detached from them. At that time, I thought that as long as I went to the workshop more often, worked hard every day, and saw the people, they wouldn't say I was detached from them! Therefore, I went to the workshop and just focused on working hard. But after working hard for a month, the people still said I was detached from them. I couldn't understand it and was full of resentment. Now, I have come to realize that when I went among the people, it was not to learn from the people and change my worldview, but to fear the people's criticism and put on a show for them. This is the 'private' self at work." She said with deep feelings: "If one does not thoroughly change one's worldview, even if one is physically among the people, one's heart will not be with them, and over time, one will become a bureaucrat standing above the people." The committee members all said: "'Private' self not overturned, 'official' self not eliminated. With the 'private' self, one is an 'official' above and an 'official' below. Only by thoroughly overthrowing the 'private' self and thoroughly changing one's worldview, and firmly establishing the idea of serving the people, can one truly connect with the people."

After raising their awareness, the committee members appeared among the people as students, respectfully learning from the people and carrying out "one helps one, one pairs with one" activities. They learned the good thoughts and good styles of the people, striving to change their worldviews; they listened to the people's demands and voices, enthusiastically helping the people solve problems and difficulties; they gathered the wisdom and methods of the people, did a good job of leading work, and better led the people to walk the path of emphasizing proletarian politics. Deputy Chairman Wu Ruifen discovered that the workers in the second row, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "carrying out heart-to-heart talks, this method is very good," took implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the content and widely carried out heart-to-heart talks, with good results. She immediately helped the second row summarize their experiences and introduced and promoted them at the cadre meeting, and together with other committee members, went deep into each row to specifically mobilize and organize the people to carry out heart-to-heart talks, making heart-to-heart talks popular throughout the factory, which strongly promoted the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The people praised, "After the cadres went among the people, they taught us to emphasize proletarian politics, truly helping us to the point."

Whether one can consciously accept the people's supervision and criticism is also an important sign of whether a cadre truly connects with the people in thought. When cadres connect with the people, the people support and care for the cadres even more. The people firmly obey and fully support the correct leadership of the revolutionary committee, and also seriously point out the shortcomings and mistakes of the committee members. Regarding the people's criticism, the vast majority of the committee members all welcomed it enthusiastically, but at the beginning, there were also individual committee members who could not accept some sharp and excessive criticism from the people. The PLA comrades helped them study Chairman Mao's teachings on connecting with the people and criticism and self-criticism again. They said with deep feelings: "Criticism is like an iron broom, sweeping away the political dust in one's mind and the obstacles to connecting with the people." Through study, everyone realized that only by consciously placing oneself under the people's supervision and humbly accepting the people's criticism can one constantly overcome one's shortcomings and mistakes and promote ideological revolutionization. Criticism is for the revolution, fearing criticism is fearing the revolution. The comrades who originally did not accept the people's criticism enough checked to find that the root of bureaucratism was a "private" self deep in the soul, were greatly shocked, and immediately launched a battle against the "private" self, thoroughly overthrowing bureaucratism.

From then on, the committee members regarded the people's supervision and criticism as the greatest care and love from class brothers. They often sought the people's opinions and accepted criticism without considering the occasion or attitude. The people praised them for "accepting the people's criticism happily and changing thoroughly."

Through repeated study, the members of the revolutionary committee's thoughts on connecting with the people became more and more solid, truly achieving a broad, constant, and close connection with the working people. The cadres and the people worked together, making the entire factory's revolution and production present an unprecedentedly good situation. Revolutionary masses praised them as "the people's confidants" and "the pioneers of ideological revolutionization." Amidst the praise, the revolutionary committee seriously studied Chairman Mao's teaching of "humility makes one progress, arrogance makes one fall behind," mobilized the people to give opinions to the revolutionary committee, compared with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and found the gaps. From then on, they raised their requirements for themselves.

　　“身入”群众只是联系群众的开始
　　“心入”群众才能真正地联系群众
    石家庄市卫东服装厂革委会在解放军同志帮助下，狠斗“官”气，树立做人民勤务员和甘当群众小学生的思想，从思想上和群众打成一片
    本报讯　石家庄市卫东服装厂革命委员会成员，在解放军支左人员的帮助下，反复学习毛主席“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的伟大教导，在联系群众问题上，做到了由“身入”群众到“心入”群众。
    卫东服装厂革委会从成立的时候起，七个委员中有六个不脱产，平时，除一个委员轮流在办公室值班处理日常工作外，其他委员全部深入车间。
    经过一段时间，解放军同志就发现：有的委员下去以后说的多，干的少；有的委员只顾自己埋头干活，不能和群众打成一片。他们及时和革委会的同志进行研究，大家认识到：干部“身入”群众，只是联系群众的开始，“心入”群众才能真正地联系群众。同时还认识到，联系群众是一场深刻的思想革命，必须不断扫除资产阶级思想和旧的习惯势力等多方面的阻力。
    大家还认识到，联系群众的根本目的之一，就是使干部时刻置身于群众的监督之下，永远保持劳动人民的本色，抵制资产阶级和各种非无产阶级思想的侵蚀，防止官僚主义，防止修正主义，使革命委员会不断发展巩固，成为突出无产阶级政治的坚强有力的战斗指挥部。要达到这个目的，就一定要遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，老老实实做“人民的勤务员”，恭恭敬敬“做群众的小学生”。
    对照毛主席的教导，他们检查前一段联系群众的情形，感到思想上还没有联系群众，根源就是头脑里有个“官”字。革委会主任、革命领导干部邢宝喜说：“原来我总觉得自己是个老干部，受党教育多年，道理比群众懂得多，工作有经验，所以到群众里面去，干部架子放不下，向群众学习得少，指手划脚多。”革委会副主任、工人吴瑞芬说：“我当了副主任后，就想：可不能高高在上，让群众说我脱离群众。当时认为，只要我下车间多干活，天天和群众见面，就不能再说我脱离群众了！因此，我下车间就只顾埋头干活。可是，辛辛苦苦干了一个月，群众还说我脱离群众。我想不通，憋了一肚子气。现在，我才认识到，我到群众里面去，不是向群众学习，改造世界观，而是怕群众提意见，做样子给群众看。这就是‘私’字作怪。”她深有体会地说：“不彻底改造世界观，即便是‘身入’群众，和群众仍然是身连心不连，日子长了，还会变成高踞于群众之上的官老爷。”委员们都说：“‘私’字不倒，‘官’字不除。有了‘私’字，在上面是‘官’，到下面还是‘官’。只有彻底打倒‘私’字，彻底改造世界观，牢固树立为人民服务的思想，才能真正做到密切联系群众。”
    认识提高后，委员们以小学生的姿态出现于群众之中，拜群众为师，虚心地向群众学习，和群众开展“一帮一、一对红”活动。他们学习了群众的好思想、好作风，努力改造世界观；他们听取了群众的要求和呼声，热情地帮助群众解决问题和困难；他们集中了群众的智慧和办法，做好领导工作，更好地带领群众走突出无产阶级政治的道路。副主任吴瑞芬发现二排的工人遵照毛主席“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好”的教导，以落实毛主席最新指示为内容，广泛地开展了谈心活动，效果很好，便立即帮助二排总结经验，并在骨干会议上介绍推广，又和其他委员一起深入各排，具体地发动、组织群众开展谈心活动，使谈心活动在全厂普遍开展起来，有力地促进了毛主席最新指示的落实。群众称赞说：“干部深入群众后，使我们学会突出无产阶级政治，真是帮到点子上了。”
    能不能自觉地接受群众的监督和批评，也是衡量一个干部是不是从思想上联系群众的重要标志。干部联系群众，群众就更加支持和爱护干部。群众对革委会的正确领导坚决服从，全力支持，对委员们的缺点错误，也严肃地提出批评。对于群众的批评，绝大多数委员都能够热情欢迎，但开始也有个别委员听到群众中的一些尖锐、过火的批评意见，就接受不下。解放军同志又帮助他们再次学习毛主席关于联系群众和批评与自我批评的教导。他们深有感触地说：“批评就象一把铁扫帚，扫除了思想上的政治灰尘，扫除了联系群众的思想障碍。”通过学习，大家认识到，只有自觉地置身于群众的监督之下，虚心接受群众的批评，才能不断克服自己的缺点、错误，促进思想革命化。批评是为了革命，怕批评就是怕革命。原来接受群众批评不够虚心的同志，检查到“官”气的根源是灵魂深处有一个“私”字，大吃一惊，立即展开了一场斗“私”的战斗，彻底斗倒了“官”气。
    从此以后，委员们把群众的监督和批评，看成是阶级兄弟对自己最大的关怀和爱护。经常地征求群众意见，做到接受批评不计较场合，不计较态度。群众赞扬他们“对待群众的批评，接受得愉快，改得彻底。”
    经过反复学习，革委会的成员联系群众的思想越树越牢，真正做到了同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。干部和群众齐心协力，使全厂革命和生产出现了一派空前大好形势，革命群众纷纷赞扬他们是“群众的知心人”，“思想革命化的带头人”。在一片赞扬声中，革命委员会又认真学习毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，深入发动群众给革命委员会提意见，对照毛主席最新指示，找出差距。从此以后，他们对自己的要求更高了。
