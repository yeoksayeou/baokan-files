The Revolutionary Committee of Changwu County Agricultural Machinery Factory in Liaoning Province has resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line since its establishment. It has guided the masses to correctly distinguish between two types of contradictions and has steadily, accurately, and fiercely struck down a handful of class enemies.

The class struggle and line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers has been greatly enhanced. Workers who have made mistakes have put down their burdens and moved forward lightly, uniting against the enemy. The proletarian dictatorship has been greatly strengthened, and the revolutionary and production situation is getting better and better.

The Revolutionary Committee of this factory, in accordance with the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," has actively launched a fierce attack on the class enemy. In the struggle against the enemy, they have paid attention to uniting their own class ranks, strictly distinguishing between two types of contradictions, and consistently directing the spearhead of the struggle at a handful of class enemies. Thus, they have steadily, accurately, and fiercely struck down the sabotage activities of the class enemies, raised the class struggle and line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers, consolidated the proletarian dictatorship, and the revolutionary and production situation is getting better and better.

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of this factory, it has followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and, through in-depth revolutionary criticism, mobilized revolutionary workers to uncover the lid of class struggle. The class enemies of this factory have always dreamed of a change in the sky and have viciously attacked the socialist system. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they hid behind the scenes, spreading the evil wind of economism and inciting anarchism, stirring up trouble among the workers, and attempting to split and disintegrate the ranks of the working class. Some of them even took off their shirts and attacked machines and created production stoppages. The living facts of class struggle have educated the broad revolutionary workers, and they have demanded to root out a handful of class enemies for struggle and to implement dictatorship over them. In the process, some workers momentarily confused the enemy-people contradiction, demanding that some workers who were deceived by the class enemies and did some wrong things be treated with the same measures.

The Revolutionary Committee of the factory promptly organized all revolutionary workers and cadres in the factory to study Chairman Mao's great teaching of "who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution," making everyone realize that the class struggle in this factory is sharp and complex. The proletarian revolutionary faction must thoroughly defeat the enemy, correctly distinguish and handle two types of contradictions, and always direct the spearhead of the struggle at a handful of class enemies, and absolutely not direct the spearhead of the struggle at their own class brothers and allies, and not confuse the two types of contradictions. Only in this way can we maximize the unity and expansion of our own class ranks and maximize the isolation and strike against the true class enemies.

Armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the working class has the clearest minds and the sharpest eyes. They use the method of class analysis to see through the phenomena and grasp the essence. They see that a bad element in this factory, out of his class instinct of exploitation, harbors deep hatred for the socialist system. In the past, under the protection of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in this factory, he refused to accept reform. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he again played his counter-revolutionary tricks, dreaming of restoring capitalism. The contradiction between him and us is an enemy-people contradiction. As for some deceived comrades who have also done some wrong things, they love Chairman Mao and love socialism. They were just temporarily deceived by the class enemies. After education, they can return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The Revolutionary Committee, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching of "the methods of resolving the two types of contradictions are different," fully mobilized revolutionary workers to carry out a great criticism and struggle against a handful of class enemies, implementing proletarian dictatorship. For class brothers who have made mistakes, through the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using the method of heart-to-heart talks, starting from class education, they have carried out patient and meticulous ideological and political work, raising their class struggle and line struggle consciousness, and wholeheartedly helping them to recognize their mistakes and helping them to find the root cause of their mistakes. Through ideological and political work, the deceived comrades have realized that reactionary anarchism is a poisoned arrow used by the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of class enemies to sabotage the revolution and production. Because of the hidden "self" in their minds, they were used by the enemy. They have expressed that in the future, they will never forget class struggle, never forget proletarian dictatorship, and constantly struggle against selfishness and revisionism, and spark a revolution in the depths of their souls, forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, becoming good workers of Chairman Mao.

The Revolutionary Committee of Changwu County Agricultural Machinery Factory, by firmly grasping the direction of the struggle, has correctly handled the two types of contradictions in the class struggle, making workers who have made mistakes raise their class consciousness, put down their burdens, and move forward lightly, uniting against the enemy. This has maximized the isolation of the class enemies and achieved victory in the struggle against the enemy. Currently, this factory is holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carrying out in-depth revolutionary criticism, and the revolutionary and production situation of the entire factory is getting better and better.

    彰武县农机厂革委会坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线
    引导群众正确区别两类不同性质矛盾  稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人
    广大革命职工的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟大大提高。犯有错误的同志放下包袱，轻装前进，团结对敌。无产阶级专政大大加强，革命和生产形势越来越好
    本报讯　辽宁省彰武县农机厂革命委员会成立后，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，主动地向阶级敌人发起了猛烈进攻。在对敌斗争中，他们注意团结自己的阶级队伍，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，把斗争矛头自始至终地指向一小撮阶级敌人，从而稳、准、狠地打击了阶级敌人的破坏活动，提高了广大革命职工的阶级斗争觉悟和路线斗争觉悟，巩固了无产阶级专政，革命和生产形势越来越好。
    这个厂革命委员会成立后，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，通过深入开展革命的大批判，发动革命职工揭开了阶级斗争盖子。这个厂的阶级敌人过去一直幻想变天，恶毒地攻击社会主义制度；在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，又躲在幕后，大刮经济主义妖风，煽动无政府主义思潮，在工人中挑拨离间，妄图分裂和瓦解工人阶级队伍。有些家伙还赤膊上阵，破坏机器和制造停产事故。活生生的阶级斗争事实，教育了广大革命职工，他们纷纷要求把一小撮阶级敌人揪出来斗争，对他们实行专政。这中间，部分职工一时混淆了敌我矛盾，他们要求把一些受阶级敌人蒙蔽而干了一些错事的工人，也采取同样的措施。
    厂革命委员会及时组织全厂革命职工和干部学习了毛主席关于“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题”的伟大教导，使大家认识到，本厂的阶级斗争是尖锐、复杂的，无产阶级革命派要彻底战胜敌人，必须正确区分和处理两类不同性质的矛盾，始终把斗争矛头对准一小撮阶级敌人，而绝不能把斗争矛头对准自己的阶级兄弟和同盟军，不能混淆两类不同性质的矛盾。这样才能最大限度地团结壮大自己的阶级队伍，最大限度地孤立和打击真正的阶级敌人。
    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级心最明，眼最亮，他们用阶级分析的方法，透过现象看清本质。他们看到本厂一个坏家伙出自他的剥削阶级本能，对社会主义制度有刻骨仇恨，过去在中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本厂的代理人的庇护下，拒不接受改造；在这次无产阶级文化大革命运动中，他又施展反革命伎俩，梦想复辟资本主义。他和我们之间的矛盾，是敌我矛盾。至于有些受蒙蔽的工人同志虽然也做了一些错事，但他们是热爱毛主席，热爱社会主义的，只是一时上了阶级敌人的当，经过教育是可以回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来的。
    革命委员会遵照毛主席关于“敌我之间和人民内部这两类矛盾的性质不同，解决的方法也不同”的教导，充分发动革命职工对一小撮阶级敌人进行大批判、大斗争，实行了无产阶级专政。对犯有错误的阶级兄弟，通过办毛泽东思想学习班，用谈心的方法，从阶级教育入手，进行了耐心细致的思想政治工作，提高他们的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，满腔热忱地帮助他们认识错误，并帮助他们找出犯错误的根源。通过思想政治工作，使受蒙蔽的同志认识到反动的无政府主义是中国赫鲁晓夫和一小撮阶级敌人用来破坏革命、生产的一支毒箭，由于自己头脑里隐藏着“私”字才被敌人所利用。他们表示今后一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，不断地斗私批修，在灵魂深处爆发革命，永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好工人。
    彰武县农机厂革委会由于牢牢地掌握了斗争的大方向，在阶级斗争中正确地处理了两类不同性质的矛盾，使犯有错误的同志提高了阶级觉悟，放下包袱，轻装前进，团结对敌。这就最大限度地孤立了阶级敌人，取得了对敌斗争的胜利。目前，这个厂正在大办毛泽东思想学习班，深入开展革命大批判，全厂革命和生产形势越来越好。
