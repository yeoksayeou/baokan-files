The peasants of Laoling Production Brigade in Lalin People's Commune, Dushan County, Guizhou, with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, have been persistently holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, and fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Now, the peasants of this brigade are wholeheartedly devoted to the revolution and the collective, presenting a vibrant revolutionary scene.

Cherishing a Heart of Loyalty

At the end of 1966, the revolutionary rebels of Lalin Commune organized a study class on the "Three Constantly Read Articles." The militia members and young activists of Laoling Brigade, after participating in the commune's study class, returned to the brigade and took the lead in organizing study groups on the "Three Constantly Read Articles," becoming the backbone of the brigade's study of Chairman Mao's works. After Chairman Mao's latest instructions on holding study classes were issued, Laoling Brigade quickly established Mao Zedong Thought study classes and formed a study committee to lead the work of the classes.

The first lesson of the study class was on class education, recalling the bitterness of the old society and comparing it with the sweetness of the new society. Everyone combined the study of relevant quotations from Chairman Mao with discussion and comparison. Many old peasants eagerly spoke up, recounting the history of their village and family. They said, in the old society, our ancestors generation after generation were like cattle and horses for the landlords. The grain went into the landlords' granaries, and the chaff went into the bellies of the poor. It was Chairman Mao who saved us from the sea of suffering. Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao, the river is not as deep as Chairman Mao's kindness. Through the activities of recalling and comparing, the broad masses of commune members further realized that Chairman Mao is the great savior of the proletariat and the working people, and Mao Zedong Thought is our soul, the red sun in the hearts of people all over the world. Everyone expressed their determination to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, becoming good commune members. Even a few elderly people and women who were previously reluctant to study also eagerly joined the study classes.

The entire brigade held study classes, with men, women, old, and young all participating in the study. How could they ensure that it was convenient for the masses while also persisting in the study? The study committee, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "from the masses, to the masses," handed the problem over to the commune members for discussion. Through discussion, it was decided to adopt the method of "brigade-organized, village-study." The study plan was uniformly arranged by the brigade, and the lectures and summaries were conducted collectively. Usually, the study was divided into three groups based on the villages, with each group taking turns to organize discussions at the homes of commune members, bringing the study classes to the homes. In this way, speeches were universal, discussions were in-depth, convenient for the masses, and ensured that the study classes could be sustained.

Fiercely Criticizing the "Revisionist" Element

What issues should the study classes focus on solving? Chairman Mao teaches us to "grasp the key of class struggle, grasp the key of the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism." Therefore, everyone believed that the study classes must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, with the struggle between the two roads as the center, linking it with local and personal actual examples, fiercely criticizing the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside. Establishing the determination of the broad masses of commune members to walk the socialist road was seen as the first problem to be solved in the study classes.

In the criticism, everyone spoke out and wrote fiercely, exposing the bitterness of being harmed by the "Three Selfs and One Package" and showcasing the sweetness of the collective path. Many poor and lower-middle peasants used their personal experiences to denounce China's Khrushchev's various fallacies. They said: China's Khrushchev advocates "Three Selfs and One Package," which is to make us retrace our steps and suffer twice. We firmly refuse. Through the criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants' determination to follow Chairman Mao and walk the socialist road became even firmer. They expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao for life, forever walking the collective path of socialism.

The brigade study committee also organized several specialized criticism sessions on China's Khrushchev's advocacy of "exploitation is meritorious," "material incentives," and other revisionist fallacies.

Through a series of specialized criticisms, the broad masses of commune members realized that the various revisionist black goods peddled by China's Khrushchev all boil down to one point: to restore capitalism. Only by uprooting this black root and thoroughly criticizing the "revisionist" element can we advance victoriously on the broad socialist path.

Fiercely Fighting the "Selfish" Element

After finding a common enemy, the study committee immediately organized the commune members to use the glorious images of Zhang Zide, Norman Bethune, and the Old Man Moving Mountains as examples, to ignite a revolution in their souls, fiercely fight against the "selfish" element in their minds, and thoroughly uproot the revisionist roots.

After repeatedly studying and discussing the "Three Constantly Read Articles," everyone exposed the various manifestations of the "selfish" element. In the past, some people emphasized "heavy household chores" and did not go to work on time. Some people only did light work and did not want to do heavy work; some people chose work based on the number of work points, doing the work with more points and avoiding the work with fewer points. In the discussion, everyone spoke up, finding dozens of manifestations of the "selfish" element. The "selfish" element was exposed, and everyone again used the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as a mirror, examining the harm of the "selfish" element, uprooting the root of the "selfish" element, forming a high tide of voluntarily exposing and fighting against the "selfish" element. Everyone deeply felt that the "selfish" element is a great disaster. If the mind is filled with the "selfish" element, it is half-hearted towards the collective; the more one fights against the "selfish" element, the closer one gets to Chairman Mao; the fiercer one fights against the "selfish" element, the tighter one can follow Chairman Mao.

In the past, some brigade cadres did not want to work because commune members had raised objections, thinking that being a cadre was laborious and unappreciated, and the relationship between cadres and the masses was not harmonious. The study committee believed that to solve the relationship between cadres and the masses, one must also fiercely fight against the "selfish" element. Cadres should correctly treat themselves and correctly treat the masses; commune members should correctly treat cadres. In the study class, everyone seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the five conditions proposed by Chairman Mao for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Through the study, their understanding was raised, and the cadres saw the problems and mistakes in their work, actively checking with the masses. Brigade leader Li Bingfu's work attitude and methods were not good enough, so he sincerely checked his shortcomings and mistakes with the commune members. Some commune members also checked their "selfish" element in treating cadres. The "selfish" element was swept away, the relationship between cadres and the masses changed, and the revolutionary and productive enthusiasm of both cadres and the masses greatly increased.

Highlighting the "Public" Element

The revolutionary masses of Laoling, through actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, have reduced the territory of the "selfish" element in their minds and expanded the territory of the "public" element. Under the inspiration of the heroic words "Cultivate for the revolution, support the world revolution," the poor and lower-middle peasants of Laoling, taking Dazhai as an example, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of hard work and self-reliance. This year, as soon as spring arrived, all the commune members, with their feet on the ice and facing the cold wind, continuously went out for four days, covering an area of more than ten li, and collected more than thirty thousand catties of cow dung. The new wind of loving the collective prevailed, and since the beginning of spring, out of the thirty-one households in the brigade, twenty-six households had donated more than ten thousand catties of fertilizer to the brigade. Poor peasant woman Guo Guangyu also donated more than two thousand catties of pig manure and ash to the brigade. Someone advised her to keep some for herself, but her twelve-year-old son Chen Youcai said: "We study Norman Bethune every day, to be selfless and dedicated to others, we should first think of the collective, not just ourselves." During the rapeseed seedling period, many commune members saw that the fields were full of water and there were no seedbeds, so they voluntarily gave up their private plots to the brigade for seedling cultivation. Examples of going to work early and taking on heavy tasks were everywhere. Currently, the entire Laoling is presenting a new situation of grasping the revolution and promoting production.

### 毛泽东思想的阳光普照拉令

    毛泽东思想的阳光普照拉令
    贵州独山县拉林公社拉令生产队的广大贫下中农，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，坚持举办毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛主席著作，全面落实毛主席的最新指示。现在这个队的贫下中农，一心为革命，一心为集体，呈现出一派热气腾腾的革命景象。
    胸怀一个“忠”字
    一九六六年底，拉林公社的无产阶级革命派举办了“老三篇”学习班，拉令生产队的民兵和青年积极分子，参加公社学习班以后，回到队里便带头组织了“老三篇”学习小组，成为全队学习毛主席著作的骨干。毛主席关于办学习班的最新指示发出后，拉令生产队就很快办起了毛泽东思想学习班，并且组成了学委会，负责领导学习班的工作。
    学习班的第一课是进行阶级教育，忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜。大家结合学习毛主席的有关语录，边学边议，边议边比。许多老贫农争相发言，大摆寨史、家史。他们说，在旧社会，我们祖祖辈辈给地主当牛马，粮食落在地主的仓里，糠皮落在穷人的肚里，是毛主席他老人家把我们从苦海里救了出来。爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，河深海深不如毛主席的恩情深。通过忆比活动，广大社员更进一步认识到，毛主席是无产阶级和劳动人民的大救星，毛泽东思想是我们的灵魂，是全世界人民心中的红太阳。大家表示，要永远忠于毛主席，永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好社员。少数过去不愿学习的老人和妇女，也都纷纷要求加入学习班。
    全队举办学习班，男女老少都参加学习，究竟怎样才能做到既便利群众，又能坚持学习呢？学委会遵照毛主席“从群众中来，到群众中去”的教导，把问题交给社员讨论。通过讨论，决定采取“队里举办，分寨学习”的办法。学习计划由队里统一安排，讲用和总结时全队集中。平时学习，全队按寨子划为三个组，以组为基点，轮流到社员家里组织讨论，把学习班办到家里。这样，发言普遍，讨论深入，又方便群众，保证了学习班能坚持办下去。
    狠批一个“修”字
    办学习班应当着重解决什么问题呢？毛主席教导我们要“抓住阶级斗争这个纲，抓住社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争这个纲”。因此，大家认为：学习班必须以毛泽东思想为武器，以两条道路斗争的问题为中心，联系本地、本身的实际事例，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在农村复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。把确立广大社员走社会主义道路的决心，作为办学习班首先解决的问题。
    在大批判中，人人口诛笔伐，大诉受“三自一包”毒害的苦，大摆走集体化道路的甜。不少贫下中农，用切身的遭遇怒斥中国赫鲁晓夫的种种谬论。他们说：中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“三自一包”，就是要我们走回头路，吃二遍苦，我们坚决不答应。通过批判，广大贫下中农紧跟毛主席，走社会主义道路的决心更坚定了。他们表示，决心一辈子紧跟毛主席，永远走社会主义集体化的道路。
    生产队学委会还就中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“剥削有功”、“物质刺激”等修正主义谬论，分别组织了几次专题批判。
    通过一系列的专题批判，广大社员认识到，中国赫鲁晓夫推销的种种修正主义黑货，归结到一点，就是要复辟资本主义。只有把这条黑根挖出来，把“修”字批倒、批臭，才能沿着社会主义的康庄大道胜利前进。
    猛斗一个“私”字
    在找到了共同的敌人之后，学委会紧接着组织社员，以张思德、白求恩、老愚公的光辉形象为榜样，在灵魂深处爆发革命，狠斗自己头脑中的“私”字，彻底挖掉修正主义根子。
    大家在反复学习、反复讨论“老三篇”以后，大摆“私”字的各种表现。过去有的人强调“家务重”，不按时出工。有的人只干轻活，不愿做重活；有的人在选择活路时，工分多的就做，工分少的就不做。讨论会上，你一言我一语，找出了“私”字的几十种表现。“私”字亮出来了，大家又再次以“老三篇”作镜子，查“私”字的危害，挖“私”字的根子，形成了自觉亮私、斗私的高潮。大家深深体会到，“私”字是个大祸根，脑子里装了“私”字，对集体便是半心半意，斗私越深，对毛主席才越亲；斗私越狠，跟毛主席才能跟得紧。
    过去，生产队有些干部因为社员提了意见不想干，认为当干部费力不讨好，干群关系不融洽。学委会认为，要解决干群关系，也必须狠斗“私”字。干部应当正确对待自己，正确对待群众；社员应当正确对待干部。学习班里大家认真地学习毛主席的最新指示，学习毛主席提出的关于培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件。通过学习，认识提高了，干部看到了自己工作中存在的问题和错误，便主动地向群众作检查。生产队长李秉富工作态度和工作方法不够好，他就向社员诚恳地检讨了自己的缺点和错误。有的社员也检查了自己对待干部问题上的“私”字。“私”字扫掉了，干群关系改变了，干部和群众的革命生产积极性都大大地提高了。
    突出一个“公”字
    拉令的革命群众，通过活学活用毛主席著作，思想上“私”字的地盘缩小了，“公”字的阵地扩大了。在“为革命种田，支援世界革命”的豪言壮语鼓舞下，拉令的贫下中农，以大寨为榜样，发扬艰苦奋斗、自力更生的革命精神。今年开春，全体社员脚踏冰凌，冒着寒风，连续出动四天，走遍方圆十多里，拣回牛粪三万多斤。热爱集体的新风普遍兴起，开春以来，全队三十一户中，就有二十六户向队里投肥共一万多斤。贫农妇女郭光玉，把两千多斤猪粪和草木灰也投给队里。有人劝她留一点自己用，她十二岁的儿子陈友才说：“我们天天学白求恩，要毫不利己专门利人，应该首先想到集体，不能只想自己。”油菜育秧时节，不少社员见田里水满，没有苗床，便主动让出自留地为队里育苗。提前上工、争挑重担的事例，处处皆是。目前，整个拉令，出现了狠抓革命，猛促生产的新局面。　本报通讯员
