The revolutionary masses of Shang Er Da Dui in Lu Yang Commune, Bei Zhen County, Liaoning Province, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. In the ongoing and in-depth revolutionary criticism, they have closely combined the actual situation of the team, criticized and reformed simultaneously, allowing the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to rapidly occupy the rural battlefield, promoting the thought revolution of the people, and making the revolutionary and production situation better and better. Seriously Carry Out the Struggle, Criticism, and Reform in One's Own Unit

Since last April, the revolutionary criticism in Shang Er Da Dui has been vigorously and continuously carried out. However, for a period of time, due to a lack of clear understanding of the relationship between criticism and reform, they focused only on "criticism" and neglected "reform." At that time, the leading cadre of the brigade, although they had considered the issue of "reform," were not sure what to reform and how to reform; they thought that the work of "reform" was detailed and complex and that it would be better to wait for the higher authorities to make a unified deployment before taking action.

The People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, in response to these active thoughts, organized the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's works and Chairman Mao's latest instructions. At the same time, they discussed and studied the actual situation of the brigade repeatedly, clarifying the relationship between criticism and reform. Someone pointed out: The Chinese Khrushchev promoted the "three selfs and one package," "work points as the criterion," "material incentives," and other revisionist goods in the countryside. If we only criticize and do not reform, we cannot thoroughly eliminate their poison and consolidate and develop the socialist economy. Someone said: Only criticizing and not reforming also cannot truly draw a clear line with the revisionist line in one's thoughts. Through discussion, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants realized that the revolutionary criticism is to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly criticize and eliminate the revisionist line, establishing a superstructure that adapts to the socialist economic base. If we only criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and do not reform the old things thoroughly according to Mao Zedong Thought, we are still walking the wrong path with our eyes wide open, which is disloyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and disloyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Everyone expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's great teaching of "We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world," using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, combining the revolutionary criticism, and seriously carrying out the struggle, criticism, and reform in one's own unit, fundamentally uprooting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev.

	Both Deep Criticism and Prompt Reform

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, it is revolution." This brigade follows Chairman Mao's teachings and adopts the method of criticizing and reforming simultaneously.

In the struggle, criticism, and reform, this brigade, on the one hand, emphasizes that we must first criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line deeply and thoroughly, and on the other hand, emphasizes that we must promptly carry out reforms on the basis of raising the masses' awareness. For example, they repeatedly criticized the reactionary fallacies advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as the "four freedoms," "three selfs and one package," "work points as the criterion," and "material incentives," making the broad masses of community members realize that they must learn from Dazhai and take the road of emphasizing proletarian politics and the road of self-reliance and hard struggle. On this ideological basis, they promptly reformed the old work-point evaluation system into a system that emphasizes Mao Zedong Thought and also reformed some wrong practices in the management of sideline production. During this spring plowing period, they also focused on the problem of not fully implementing the state plan in planting in previous years, vigorously criticizing and eliminating the revisionist poison in management, firmly establishing the concept of seeing the big picture and considering the whole, and ensuring that the planting plan is implemented according to the policy of prioritizing grain and the state plan to the plot.

In the process of destroying old systems and establishing new ones, they adopted the principle of being both active and cautious. Some old systems are relatively easy to reform, and they were immediately reformed after criticism and struggle. For example: sending laborers to build dikes, in previous years, high work points and high subsidies were given, through revolutionary criticism, everyone realized that this was poisoned by the Chinese Khrushchev's "material incentives," and it was reformed when building dikes last autumn. Some old systems are more complex to reform, and they first conducted typical experiments and then gradually promoted them. For example: abolishing the old work-point evaluation method and implementing the Dazhai-style evaluation system, they first conducted a pilot in a production team, and after gaining experience, they promoted it throughout the brigade. Their experience is: relatively simple and easy-to-reform issues should not be made too complicated, otherwise, they will not be reformed for a long time; complex issues should not be simplified, otherwise, they will easily deviate and take detours.

	The Masses Educate Themselves in the Process of Struggle, Criticism, and Reform

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "For any work that requires the participation of the masses, if there is no self-awareness and voluntariness among the masses, it will become a mere formality and fail."

The leading cadre of Shang Er Da Dui believes that reforming old systems and establishing new systems is not only a struggle to criticize and eliminate revisionism but also a mass movement to break private interests and establish public interests. It will inevitably encounter the obstruction of old habits. If reforms are not carried out by mobilizing the masses but only by a few cadres discussing and issuing orders, reforms will not be good. They closely rely on the masses, fully mobilize the masses, and while criticizing and exposing the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, they use Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as a guide to repeatedly and seriously discuss the new systems to be established. In this way, they not only removed various ideological obstacles to the establishment of new systems but also turned the reform process into a process of self-education for the masses, raising the masses' awareness of class struggle and line struggle. For example, when discussing the reform of the old work-point evaluation system into the Dazhai-style evaluation system, many cadres and community members, on the one hand, exposed and criticized the harm of the old work-point evaluation system, and on the other hand, also examined their own unnecessary worries and various selfish thoughts about establishing the Dazhai-style evaluation system, expressing their determination to break free from the shackles of old habits, get rid of selfishness, insist on putting "public" first, and take the road of emphasizing proletarian politics. Therefore, after the new system was established, it was implemented relatively smoothly. Because of the thorough discussion, the roots of Mao Zedong Thought were planted in the minds of the masses, and they could actively resist things that did not conform to Mao Zedong Thought from all sides. Once, the brigade organized each team to go up the mountain to collectively collect firewood, worrying that the labor efficiency of each team would be high and low, and fearing that there would be disputes, they proposed an old method of setting a quota of seven bundles of firewood. As soon as this method was proposed, it was sharply criticized by the community members: "We have already implemented the Dazhai-style work-point system, why are we implementing the piecework system again? This is not going back to the old road?" This incident gave the cadres a profound lesson.

The leading cadre of Shang Er Da Dui realized that to reform old systems, one must break private interests and establish public interests. If the "private" is not overthrown, the reform will not be good. In the process of reform, they vigorously promoted the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, breaking private interests and establishing public interests, promoting the broad revolutionary masses to further establish an unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. Whatever conforms to Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, they will resolutely carry it out; whatever is counter-revolutionary revisionism, they will resolutely eliminate it, cutting it off completely. The facts have proven that the more private interests are fought, the more thoroughly revisionism is criticized, the more thorough the reform will be.

    上二大队革命群众以毛泽东思想为武器边批边改效果好
    在革命大批判中破旧立新
    本报讯　辽宁省北镇县闾阳公社上二大队，在人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在持续深入开展革命大批判中，紧密结合本队实际，边斗批边改革，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想迅速占领农村阵地，促进了人的思想革命化，使革命和生产形势越来越好。认真搞好本单位的斗批改
    从去年四月份以来，上二大队的革命大批判一直轰轰烈烈地持续地开展着。但在一段时间内，由于对批和改的关系认识不清，只注意了“批”，忽视了“改”。那时候，大队领导班子对于“改”的问题虽然也有过考虑，但是对改什么，怎样改，感到没有把握；认为“改”这项工作细致复杂，不如等上级有了统一部署再动手。
    解放军毛泽东思想宣传队针对这些活思想，组织广大贫下中农反复学习毛主席有关著作和毛主席一系列最新指示，同时针对本队的实际情况，反复讨论研究，弄清批和改的关系。有人指出：中国赫鲁晓夫在农村推行了“三自一包”、“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”等修正主义货色，如果只批不改，就不能彻底肃清其流毒，就不能巩固和发展社会主义经济。有人说：只批不改，也不能真正从思想上同修正主义路线划清界限。通过讨论，广大贫下中农认识到，革命的大批判，就是要用毛泽东思想为武器，彻底批判和清除修正主义那一套，建立起适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑。如果只批判了反革命修正主义路线，不去按照毛泽东思想对旧的东西进行彻底的改革，仍然瞪着眼睛走邪路，就是对伟大领袖毛主席的不忠，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的不忠。大家一致表示，一定要遵照毛主席“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界”的伟大教导，以毛泽东思想为武器，结合革命的大批判，认真搞好本单位的斗、批、改，从根本上铲除中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的反革命修正主义路线。
      既要批深批透又要抓紧改革
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。”这个大队遵照毛主席的教导，采取边斗批边改革的方法。
    这个大队在斗、批、改中，一方面强调首先要把反革命修正主义批深批透，一方面强调在提高群众觉悟的基础上抓紧进行改革。例如，他们反复批判了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“四大自由”、“三自一包”、“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”等反动谬论，使广大社员认识到必须向大寨学习，走突出无产阶级政治的路，走自力更生、艰苦奋斗的路。在这个思想基础上，他们就抓紧把旧的评工记分制改为突出毛泽东思想的评分制，而且改革了一些在副业经营方面的错误做法。今年春耕期间，又抓住往年在种植方面不全面执行国家计划的问题，大力批判和肃清经营管理上的修正主义流毒，牢固地树立了识大局、顾整体的观念，使种植计划按照以粮为纲的方针和国家的计划落实到地块。
    在破旧制度、建新制度的过程中，他们采取了既积极又慎重的原则。有些旧的制度改革比较容易，斗批之后，立即进行改革。例如：出民工修堤，往年是高工分高补助，通过革命大批判，大家认识到这是中了中国赫鲁晓夫“物质刺激”的毒，去秋修堤的时候就改了。有些旧制度改革起来比较复杂，就先典型试验，然后逐步推广。例如：废除旧的评工记分方法，实行大寨式的评分制，就先在一个生产队试点，取得经验后，才在全大队全面推行。他们的体会是：比较简单易改的问题不能搞烦琐了，烦琐了就迟迟改不了；复杂的问题又不能简单化，简单化就容易出偏差，走弯路。
    群众在斗批改过程中自己教育自己
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“凡是需要群众参加的工作，如果没有群众的自觉和自愿，就会流于徒有形式而失败。”
    上二大队领导班子认为，改革旧制度，建立新制度，既是一场批判和肃清修正主义的斗争，又是一场群众性的破私立公的运动，必然会遇到旧的习惯势力的阻碍。如果在改革中不放手发动群众，而是只靠几个干部商量一下，下个命令，是改革不好的。他们紧紧依靠群众，充分发动群众，在批倒批臭中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义谬论的同时，以毛主席的无产阶级革命路线为指针，对要建立的新制度进行反复认真的讨论。这样，既扫除了建立新制度的各种思想障碍，又把改革的过程变成了群众自我教育的过程，提高了群众的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。例如，在讨论把旧的评工记分制改为大寨式评分制的时候，不少干部、社员一方面揭露和批判了旧的评工记分制的危害，一方面也检查了自己对建立大寨式评分制的不必要的耽心和种种私心杂念，表示一定要摆脱旧的习惯势力的束缚，去掉私心，坚持“公”字当头，走突出无产阶级政治的路。因此，新制度建立以后，执行得都比较顺利。由于经过充分的讨论，群众头脑中扎下了毛泽东思想的根子，就能主动抵制来自各方面的不符合毛泽东思想的东西。有一次，大队组织各队上山集体打柴，耽心各队劳动效率有高有低，怕闹意见，就拟定了个打七捆柴为一个定额的老办法。这个办法一提出，就受到了社员的尖锐批评：“咱们已经实行了大寨式工分制，为什么又搞起小包工来了，这不是又走老路吗？”这件事使干部受到了一次深刻的教育。
    上二大队领导班子认识到，要改革旧制度，必须破私立公。如果不斗倒“私”字，改是改不好的。他们在改革的过程中，狠抓活学活用毛泽东思想，破私立公，促使广大革命群众进一步树立对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠心。凡是符合毛泽东思想，符合毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的事情，就坚决去办；凡是反革命修正主义的东西，就坚决破除，一刀两断。事实证明，斗私越狠，修正主义批得越臭，改革就越彻底。
