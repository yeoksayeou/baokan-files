Hoist the Banner of "It Is Reasonable to Rebel Against the Reactionaries" and Achieve Decisive Victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution
The Revolutionary Spirit of Complete Revolution in Yan'an, Cultivated by Chairman Mao, Shines Brightly
The Revolutionary Committees of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City Are Born in Glory Simultaneously

Over 300,000 military and civilian personnel held a celebration rally, wishing the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life, and celebrating the unprecedentedly excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shaanxi Province. They resolved to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to heighten revolutionary vigilance by a hundredfold, to carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, to launch continuous attacks on the enemies of the proletariat, to oppose right-opportunism, right-splittism, and right-capitulationism, and to smash the right-reversal wind. They must further consolidate and develop revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, further carry out the movement to support the military and love the people, and strengthen military-civilian unity. They must uphold the spirit of hard struggle, seize the revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness, and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, May 2nd - Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, amidst the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and on the joyous day of celebrating the international labor holiday of May 1st, which is cherished by the proletariat and laboring people worldwide, joyous news came from the northwest of the motherland: the Revolutionary Committees of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City were born in glory simultaneously! This is another great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, another great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Shaanxi is the location of the revolutionary holy land Yan'an. In 1935, our beloved great leader Chairman Mao led the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army on a 25,000-li Long March and successfully arrived in northern Shaanxi. Chairman Mao, in the revolutionary holy land Yan'an and northern Shaanxi, led the people of the entire nation in a long-term, heroic anti-Japanese war and people's liberation war, defeating the aggression of Japanese imperialism, overthrowing the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and toppling the three big mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism that had been weighing down on the Chinese people, establishing New China under the dictatorship of the proletariat. During those war years, Chairman Mao, in Yan'an and northern Shaanxi, wrote a series of brilliant Marxist-Leninist documents, ingeniously, creatively, and comprehensively inheriting, defending, and developing Marxism-Leninism. The Yan'an people, who lived by Chairman Mao's side, were loyal and steadfast, following the course charted by the great helmsman Chairman Mao, and together with the people of the entire nation, struggled hard and fought bravely, moving from one victory to another.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and with Vice Chairman Lin as his deputy, paid great attention to the cultural revolution in Shaanxi Province. Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, the heroic Yan'an people and the revolutionary masses of the entire Shaanxi Province, with deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, inherited and carried forward the spirit of complete proletarian revolution in Yan'an, raised high the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries," and launched a powerful and fierce attack on the representatives of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the northwest region and Shaanxi Province, exposing the traitors, spies, and capitalist-roaders in power in the northwest and Shaanxi regions, headed by Liu Lantao, Zhao Shiyi, and Li Qiming, seizing back the power they had usurped into the hands of the proletarian revolutionaries, and eliminating the counter-revolutionary poison of Peng Dehuai, Gao Gang, and Habib Cen in the northwest, achieving decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The establishment of the Revolutionary Committees of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City signifies the complete failure of the evil plot of the Chinese Khrushchev and other top capitalist-roaders within the party and their agents to restore capitalism, marking the entry of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shaanxi Province into a new stage. Currently, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shaanxi Province is unprecedentedly excellent and getting better. From the southern slopes of the Qinling Mountains to the banks of the Yan River, the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought has never been as widespread and in-depth as it is now, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has never been as deeply ingrained in people's hearts as it is now, and the people have never been as spirited as they are now. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has promoted production, and industrial and agricultural production is thriving.

The PLA units stationed in Shaanxi and the broad cadres and soldiers of the Shaanxi Military Region have resolutely implemented the instructions of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin in the "three supports, two militaries" work, making great contributions and achieving remarkable results. In the great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the broad cadres and soldiers have resolutely responded to the battle cry of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," firmly standing on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, using Mao Zedong Thought to strongly support the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses, raising their class consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines. The PLA cadres and soldiers also, following Chairman Mao's teachings on carrying out heart-to-heart talks, which is a good method, helped various revolutionary mass organizations to criticize and rectify themselves, correctly handle internal contradictions among the people, unite against the enemy, and on the principle of Mao Zedong Thought, through consultation, promoted, consolidated, and developed the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

On May 1st, Xi'an City presented a grand festive scene. Over 300,000 revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and PLA cadres and soldiers from all fronts across the province, holding red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," surrounded by the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, singing "The East Is Red," surged from all directions towards People's Square, enthusiastically celebrating the glorious birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City.

The celebration rally began with the majestic music of "The East Is Red." When the rally solemnly announced the glorious birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City, the entire venue echoed with repeated cheers: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China! Celebrate May 1st, the International Labor Day! Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Wish the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

Comrade Li Ruishan, the head of the Shaanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the celebration rally. He said: Steering a ship across the sea relies on the helmsman; making a revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. All the achievements we have made are the victories of the great Mao Zedong Thought and the victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Comrade Li Ruishan said, Chairman Mao recently pointed out in a profound way: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in essence, is a political revolution under the conditions of socialism, in which the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is the continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China, led by Chairman Mao, and the broad revolutionary masses, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is the continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." This is the most profound summary made by our great teacher Chairman Mao, based on his rich class struggle practice, of the great significance and class content of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in the Shaanxi region fully proves Chairman Mao's great and wise judgment. Before liberation, Shaanxi Province was an important battlefield in the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China, led by Chairman Mao, and the broad revolutionary masses, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. At that time, Yan'an was the center of the Chinese revolution, and Xi'an was an important stronghold of the reactionary forces of Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan. The revolution and counter-revolution in Shaanxi engaged in a life-and-death struggle. After liberation, this struggle continued fiercely. The Chinese Khrushchev and other top capitalist-roaders within the party, along with their agents in Shaanxi, colluded with the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, attempting to restore capitalism in Shaanxi and the northwest region, and carried out a series of evil activities. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in the Shaanxi region, raising high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smashed the evil plot of this small group of class enemies to restore capitalism. However, the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution gets to comprehensive victory, the more the class enemies will struggle desperately. We must heighten our revolutionary vigilance by a hundredfold, strengthen our awareness of the enemy situation, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and launch continuous attacks on the enemies of the proletariat. He pointed out that at present, we must resolutely oppose right-opportunism, right-splittism, and right-capitulationism, and smash the right-reversal wind. We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, mobilize the masses, and carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticizing and exposing the Chinese Khrushchev and other top capitalist-roaders within the party and their agents in Shaanxi, and completely eliminating their counter-revolutionary revisionist poison politically, ideologically, and theoretically, ensuring they never rise again. We must fully expose traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, counter-revolutionary two-faced people, and all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and dig them all out.

Comrade Li Ruishan said, the great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "The basic experience of the revolutionary committees is threefold: one is the representation of revolutionary cadres, one is the representation of the military, and one is the representation of revolutionary masses, realizing the three-in-one combination of the revolution. The revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organs, streamline and reduce personnel, and organize a revolutionary leadership cadre that is connected with the masses." Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction is a powerful ideological weapon for building revolutionary committees, and we must resolutely implement and quickly put it into practice. We must carry forward the spirit of complete proletarian revolution and the hard-struggling style of Yan'an, as well as the glorious tradition of the Yan'an Rectification Movement, building the revolutionary committees into a strong command center that is absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, studies, implements, propagates, and defends Mao Zedong Thought, and a strong command center that implements Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The military and civilian personnel of the entire province must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the military and love the people," further strengthening military-civilian unity. We must further implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution, promoting production, work, and preparedness" and "further economizing to make the revolution," achieving a double harvest of revolution and production. Comrade Li Ruishan said, we must inherit and carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of Yan'an, raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, highlight proletarian politics, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, advance victoriously, achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and build Shaanxi Province into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Hu Wei, the vice head of the Shaanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the responsible person of the PLA units stationed in Shaanxi, spoke at the celebration rally. He said, the great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionary forces, when they are about to perish, will always struggle desperately." The enemies of the proletariat will not resign themselves to defeat and will definitely use various means to sabotage the newly born proletarian revolutionary regime. The People's Liberation Army is a strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must remember the great leader Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," heighten our revolutionary vigilance by a hundredfold, and be on high alert against the sabotage activities of a small group of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and other remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries. We must firmly grasp class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, resolutely smash the reversal wind of a small group of class enemies. We must further do a good job in the "three supports, two militaries" work, strengthen military-civilian unity, defend the newly born proletarian revolutionary regime, defend the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and achieve new merits for the people.

At the celebration rally, representatives of revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and Red Guards from Shaanxi Province also spoke. They expressed their revolutionary enthusiasm and warmly congratulated the birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City. They unanimously expressed that they would raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, under the leadership of the revolutionary committees, further carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, be eternally loyal to Chairman Mao, eternally loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and eternally loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They expressed that they would definitely closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, always direct the spearhead of the struggle at the top capitalist-roaders within the party and their agents, as well as traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries. They must resolutely criticize bourgeois factionalism, insist on the factionalism of the proletarian revolutionaries, enhance proletarian party spirit, further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, do a good job in revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and reform of their own units. They must further carry out the movement to support the military and love the people, strengthen military-civilian unity, seize the revolution, promote production, and do a better job in all aspects, making new contributions to achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Xian Hanhan, the responsible person of the Lanzhou Military Region, warmly congratulated the establishment of the Revolutionary Committees of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City at the meeting.

Those who attended the celebration rally also included Vice Heads of the Shaanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, Comrades Huang Jingyao, Xiao Chun, Zhang Peixin, Ma Xisheng, Dan Yingjie, Wang Fengqin, Li Shiying, Sun Fulin, and Yang Mengyun, Head of the Xi'an City Revolutionary Committee, Comrade Sun Changxing, as well as members of the Shaanxi Provincial and Xi'an City Revolutionary Committees, and responsible comrades of the Shaanxi Military Region, PLA units stationed in Shaanxi, and various military academies.

The meeting, amidst thunderous applause and cheers, passed a telegram of respect to our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao.

After the meeting, a grand celebration parade was held. (Accompanied by photographs)

    三十多万军民举行庆祝大会，敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆，欢呼陕西省无产阶级文化大革命形势空前大好。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，百倍提高革命警惕，深入持久地开展革命大批判，不断向无产阶级的敌人主动进攻，反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，粉碎右倾翻案妖风。要进一步巩固和发展革命大联合和三结合，进一步开展拥军爱民运动，大力加强军民团结。要发扬艰苦奋斗的作风，抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    新华社西安二日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，在无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利的凯歌声中，在全国人民热烈庆祝全世界无产阶级和劳动人民团结战斗的节日——“五一”国际劳动节的大喜日子里，祖国西北传来了振奋人心的喜讯：陕西省和西安市革命委员会同时光荣诞生了！这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利！
    陕西是革命圣地延安的所在地。一九三五年，我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，率领中国工农红军长征二万五千里，胜利地到达了陕北。毛主席在革命圣地延安和陕北，领导全国人民进行了长期的英勇的抗日战争和人民解放战争，打败了日本帝国主义的侵略，推翻了国民党反动派的统治，推倒了压在中国人民头上的帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三座大山，建立了无产阶级专政的新中国。在那战争岁月里，毛主席在延安和陕北，写下了一系列马克思列宁主义的光辉文献，天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义。生活在毛主席身边的延安儿女，赤胆忠心，沿着伟大舵手毛主席指引的航向，同全国人民一道，艰苦奋斗，英勇作战，从一个胜利走向又一个胜利。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，伟大领袖毛主席和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，非常关怀陕西省的文化大革命。在毛主席一系列最新指示的鼓舞下，英雄的延安儿女和陕西全省广大革命群众，怀着无限忠于毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，继承和发扬延安的无产阶级彻底革命精神，高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在西北地区和陕西省的代理人发起了强大的、猛烈的进攻，揭露了西北和陕西地区以刘澜涛、赵守一、李启明为首的一小撮叛徒、特务和党内走资本主义道路的当权派，把他们窃踞的权力夺回到无产阶级革命派手中，清除了彭德怀、高岗、习仲勋在西北的反革命流毒，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    陕西省和西安市革命委员会的成立，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其代理人在这里复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋彻底破产，标志着陕西省的无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个崭新阶段。当前，陕西省的无产阶级文化大革命形势空前大好，越来越好。从秦岭南北到延河两岸，全省活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动从来没有象现在这样广泛深入，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线从来没有象现在这样深入人心，人民群众从来没有象现在这样精神焕发。无产阶级文化大革命推动了生产，工农业生产蒸蒸日上。
    人民解放军驻陕西部队和陕西军区广大指战员，坚决执行毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席的指示，在“三支”“两军”工作中，作出了巨大的贡献，取得了很大的成绩。广大指战员在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗中，坚决响应伟大统帅毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的战斗号令，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，用毛泽东思想大力支持无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，提高他们的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。人民解放军指战员们还遵照毛主席关于开展谈心活动，这个方法很好的教导，帮助各革命群众组织斗私批修，正确处理人民内部矛盾，团结对敌，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上，通过协商，促进、巩固和发展了革命大联合、革命三结合。
    五月一日，西安市到处呈现着盛大节日的欢乐景象。来自全省各条战线的无产阶级革命派、革命群众、红卫兵小将和人民解放军指战员三十多万人，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，簇拥着毛主席巨幅画像，高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，从四面八方涌向人民广场，热烈庆祝陕西省和西安市革命委员会的胜利诞生。
    庆祝大会在雄壮的《东方红》乐曲声中开始。当大会庄严宣告陕西省和西安市革命委员会胜利诞生时，全场一遍又一遍地欢呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想胜利万岁！”“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！”“庆祝‘五一’国际劳动节！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”“敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    陕西省革命委员会主任李瑞山同志在庆祝大会上讲了话。他说：大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。我们所取得的一切成就，都是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利，都是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的胜利。
    李瑞山同志说，毛主席最近极深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”这是我们伟大导师毛主席总结丰富的阶级斗争实践，对无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义和阶级内容所作的最深刻的概括。陕西地区的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，完全证实了毛主席的这一伟大英明的论断。解放前，陕西省是以毛主席为首的中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的重要战场。那时，延安是中国革命的中心，西安是蒋介石、胡宗南匪帮的反革命重要据点，革命和反革命在陕西进行了殊死的搏斗。解放后，这个斗争仍然在激烈地进行着。中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派及其在陕西的代理人，勾结国民党反动派的残渣余孽，妄图在陕西和西北地区复辟资本主义，进行了一系列的罪恶活动。在无产阶级文化大革命中，陕西地区的广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底粉碎了这一小撮阶级敌人复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。但是，无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，阶级敌人越是要进行垂死的挣扎。我们务必百倍提高革命警惕，加强敌情观念，加强无产阶级专政，不断地向无产阶级的敌人主动进攻。他指出，目前要坚决反对右倾机会主义，右倾分裂主义，右倾投降主义，粉碎右倾翻案风。我们必须紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，放手发动群众，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在陕西的代理人批倒批臭，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底肃清他们的反革命修正主义流毒，叫他们永世不得翻身。要充分揭露叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派、反革命两面派和一切暗藏的反革命分子，把他们统统挖出来。
    李瑞山同志说，伟大领袖毛主席最近指示我们：
  “革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”毛主席的这一光辉指示，是建设革命委员会的强大思想武器，我们一定要坚决执行，迅速落实。要发扬延安的无产阶级彻底革命精神和艰苦奋斗的作风，以及延安整风的光荣传统，把革命委员会建设成为无限忠于毛主席，学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想的坚强指挥部，成为贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的坚强指挥部。全省军民要坚决响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，进一步加强军民团结。要进一步贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”和“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大方针，夺取革命、生产双丰收。李瑞山同志说，我们要继承和发扬延安的光荣革命传统，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，把陕西省建设成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    陕西省革命委员会副主任、驻陕西部队负责人胡炜同志在庆祝大会上讲了话。他说，伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。”无产阶级的敌人决不甘心于他们的失败，他们一定会用各种手段来破坏新生的无产阶级革命政权。中国人民解放军是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石，我们一定要牢记伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，百倍提高革命警惕，严防一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派等国民党反动派余孽的阴谋破坏活动。我们要狠抓阶级斗争，狠抓两条路线斗争，坚决粉碎一小撮阶级敌人的翻案妖风。我们要进一步做好“三支”“两军”工作，加强军民团结，保卫新生的无产阶级革命政权，保卫伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，为人民立新功。
    在庆祝大会上，陕西省革命工人、贫下中农和红卫兵小将的代表也讲了话。他们满怀革命豪情，热烈祝贺陕西省和西安市革命委员会的诞生。他们一致表示，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在革命委员会的领导下，进一步广泛深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们表示，一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，把斗争矛头始终对准党内最大的一小撮走资派及其代理人，以及叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子。要坚决批判资产阶级派性，坚持无产阶级革命派的派性，增强无产阶级党性，进一步巩固和发展革命大联合、革命三结合，搞好革命的大批判和本单位的斗、批、改。要进一步开展拥军爱民运动，大力加强军民团结。要抓革命，促生产，把各方面的工作做得更好，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利做出新贡献。
    兰州军区负责人冼恒汉同志在会上热烈祝贺陕西省和西安市革命委员会的成立。
    参加庆祝大会的还有陕西省革命委员会副主任黄经耀、肖纯、张培信、马希圣、单英杰、王凤琴、李世英、孙福林、杨梦云同志，西安市革命委员会主任孙长兴同志，以及陕西省和西安市革命委员会委员和人民解放军陕西军区、驻陕西部队、各军事院校的负责同志。
    大会在暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声中，通过了给我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。
    会后，举行了规模盛大的庆祝游行。（附图片）
