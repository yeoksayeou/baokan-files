Today is "Palestine Day." The Palestinian people and the Arab people are persisting in their struggle against American imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel. The Chinese people resolutely support this just struggle.

The armed struggle launched by the Palestinian people against the American and Israeli aggressors is further deepening and developing. Especially since this year, in just over four months, the Palestinian guerrillas have launched more than a hundred large and small attacks, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. The flames of armed struggle have spread throughout the entire area occupied by Israel, even reaching the heart of Israeli rule in the vicinity of Tel Aviv. The activities of the people's anti-imperialist armed forces are unprecedented in terms of the breadth of the region, the scale, the frequency of the attacks, and the intensity of the battles. The Palestinian guerrilla forces, learning war from war, continuously accumulating experience, are growing from small to large.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has wisely pointed out: "Regardless of the size of the country, as long as the people are fully mobilized, firmly rely on the people, and wage people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated."

As long as the Palestinian people persist in their armed struggle, they will surely achieve final victory. The fundamental reason is that this struggle is just, it has the support of the peoples of various Arab countries, and it has the sympathy and support of the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world.

The more than one million Arab refugees who were brutally expelled from their homes by the Israeli aggressors and the Arab people in the Israeli-occupied areas are the main reliance of the current Palestinian people's anti-imperialist armed struggle. The Palestinian guerrillas, rooted among the Arab people who are deeply oppressed by nationalism, fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and establish bases for armed struggle. This is the fundamental guarantee for persisting in and developing armed struggle.

American imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel, are the common enemy of one hundred million Arab people. The peoples of various Arab countries, seeing the aggressor invaders trample on Arab territory, seeing their homeland fall, and their brothers suffer oppression and bullying, unite in hatred against the enemy and oppose the aggression of the United States and Israel. Recently, in the battle to counter the Israeli invading army, Jordanian patriotic soldiers fought side by side with the Palestinian guerrillas, bravely repelling the Israeli military advance, which is a vivid example.

American imperialism and its number one accomplice, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, are doing everything they can to extinguish the armed struggle of the Palestinian people and prevent the Arab people from taking the path of armed resistance to aggression. They use the United Nations to promote so-called "political solutions," and they try to split and control Arab countries in order to undermine the Palestinian people's armed struggle from within. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique's policy of fake support and real betrayal towards Arab countries fully exposes it as an extremely dangerous and vicious enemy of the Palestinian people and the Arab people, just like the American imperialists.

The Palestinian people and the Arab people have increasingly come to realize from their own experiences that the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's so-called "political solution" is essentially to induce the Arab people to abandon armed struggle and surrender to the United States and its tool, Israel. This is something that the Palestinian people and the peoples of various Arab countries will never allow.

Facing the anti-aggression struggle of the Palestinian people and the peoples of various Arab countries, American imperialism and its lackey, the Israeli ruling clique, are actually in a very weak position. American imperialism has been beaten black and blue on the Vietnam battlefield and is itself facing increasingly serious political and economic crises. Israel currently occupies a large area of Arab countries, has a long front line, and faces many difficulties, already bearing a heavy burden. Although the American and Israeli aggressors appear formidable, they actually do not have much power. As long as the Palestinian people persist in a long-term guerrilla war and one hundred million Arab people unite more closely to wage armed struggle against aggression, the American and Israeli aggressors will inevitably suffer the final, shameful defeat.

Fight bravely, warriors of the Palestinian guerrilla forces!

    坚持武装斗争就是胜利
    本报评论员
    今天是“巴勒斯坦日”。巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯人民正在坚持反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列的斗争。中国人民坚决支持这一正义的斗争。
    巴勒斯坦人民发动的抗击美以侵略者的武装斗争，正在进一步深入发展。特别是今年以来，仅仅四个多月，巴勒斯坦游击队大小出击一、二百次，大量杀伤了敌人。武装斗争的烈火遍及整个以色列占领区，甚至达到以色列统治的心脏特拉维夫附近。人民反帝武装力量的活动，其地区之广，规模之大，次数之频繁，战斗之激烈，都是前所未有的。巴勒斯坦人民游击队，从战争中学习战争，不断地积累经验，正在由小到大成长起来。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席英明指出：“国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”
    巴勒斯坦人民的武装斗争，只要坚持下去，就一定能够取得最后胜利。其根本的原因就是，这个斗争是正义的，它有着阿拉伯各国人民的支援，有着亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界革命人民的同情和支持。
    被以色列侵略者蛮横驱逐出自己家园的一百多万阿拉伯难民和以色列占领区的阿拉伯人民，是当前巴勒斯坦人民反帝武装斗争的主要依靠。巴勒斯坦游击队，扎根在深受民族压迫的阿拉伯人民中间，充分发动群众，依靠群众，建立武装斗争基地，这是坚持武装斗争、发展武装斗争的根本保证。
    美帝及其侵略工具以色列，是一亿阿拉伯人民的共同敌人。阿拉伯各国人民眼看着侵略强盗蹂躏阿拉伯的领土，眼看着国土沦丧，自己的兄弟受尽压迫和欺凌，他们同仇敌忾，反对美以的侵略。最近，在反击以色列侵略军的战斗中，约旦的爱国士兵同巴勒斯坦游击队英勇地并肩战斗，击退以色列的军事进攻，就是一个生动的例证。
    美帝国主义及其头号帮凶苏修叛徒集团，千方百计地想要扑灭巴勒斯坦人民的武装斗争，阻止阿拉伯人民走武装反对侵略的道路。它们通过联合国，大搞所谓“政治解决”，它们力图分化和控制阿拉伯国家，以便从内部来破坏巴勒斯坦人民的武装斗争。苏修叛徒集团对阿拉伯国家实行的假支持、真出卖的反革命两面政策，充分暴露了它同美帝一样，是巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯人民的极其危险、极其凶恶的敌人。
    巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯人民从切身经验中，越来越清楚地认识到，苏修叛徒集团的所谓“政治解决”，实质上就是诱迫阿拉伯人民放弃武装斗争，向美帝及其工具以色列妥协投降。这是巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯各国人民决不容许的。
    面对着巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯各国人民的反侵略斗争，美帝国主义及其走狗以色列统治集团，实际上处于十分虚弱的地位。美帝国主义在越南战场上被打得焦头烂额，本身又面临日益严重的政治和经济危机。以色列目前占领了阿拉伯国家的大片领土，战线很长，困难很多，已经背上了沉重的包袱。看起来，美以侵略者气势汹汹，其实并没有什么了不起的力量。只要巴勒斯坦人民坚持长期的游击战争，一亿阿拉伯人民更加紧密地团结起来，进行反侵略的武装斗争，美以侵略者就必将遭到最后的、可耻的失败。
    英勇地战斗吧，巴勒斯坦游击队的战士们！
