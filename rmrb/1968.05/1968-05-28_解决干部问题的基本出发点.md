The great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "We must believe that more than 90 percent of the cadres are good or relatively good. Those who have made mistakes, the majority can be reformed."

Chairman Mao's instruction provides a Marxist-Leninist scientific analysis of the basic situation of our cadre corps, serving as the fundamental starting point for us to correctly solve the cadres problem.

Since liberation, the basic facts of our political life fully demonstrate that the majority of our cadres are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They are resolute in taking the socialist road and faithfully serving the proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people. Those cadres who have made mistakes, the majority of them, through the tempering of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution mass movement and with the help of the revolutionary masses, have deeply examined their souls, further transformed their worldviews, and have already or are in the process of correcting their mistakes. As for those traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders who have infiltrated the cadre corps, they are only a handful. This is our basic assessment of the cadre corps, and it is the proletarian class standpoint that we must possess when looking at the cadres problem.

Only by starting from this basic assessment can we comprehensively and historically examine cadres, see the main trends, see the major principles, and make a realistic evaluation of cadres. We can place those outstanding revolutionary cadres who have been tested through class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in key positions, fully utilizing their role as the backbone in the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

Only by starting from this basic assessment can we expand the scope of education and correctly deal with cadres who have made mistakes. We can implement the traditional policy of "punishing the past to prevent the future, curing the sickness to save the person," patiently educating and helping them to correct their mistakes, and bring them over to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Only by starting from this basic assessment can we correctly distinguish between enemy contradictions and contradictions among the people, unite with the vast majority, concentrate our forces, and direct our attacks at the handful of anti-Party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought counter-revolutionary revisionists, and at those traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionary two-faced characters who have infiltrated the cadre corps. We can steadily, accurately, and resolutely strike at the enemies of the proletariat.

Therefore, only by starting from this basic assessment can we avoid making rightist or ultra-leftist errors in the cadres problem. We will neither overlook the sharp and complex class struggle, thinking that all cadres are good and giving the rightist capitulationist black wind an opportunity to take advantage, nor will we view the cadre corps as a complete mess, suspecting everything and overthrowing everything, and killing off anyone who makes a mistake with one blow.

All revolutionary cadres must not disappoint the great leader Chairman Mao's concern and expectations. Stand firmly on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, correctly deal with the masses, correctly deal with oneself, be humble and prudent, and guard against arrogance and impatience. Always be a student of the masses, and together with the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses, strive for new achievements in the struggle to win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    解决干部问题的基本出发点
    本报评论员
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“要相信百分之九十以上的干部是好的和比较好的。犯了错误的人，大多数是可以改的。”
    毛主席的这一指示，对我们干部队伍的基本状况，作了马克思列宁主义的科学分析，是我们正确解决干部问题的基本出发点。
    解放以来，我国政治生活的基本事实充分说明，我们的干部大多数是忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的，是坚决走社会主义道路，忠实地为无产阶级和广大劳动人民服务的。犯了错误的干部，他们中间的大多数，经过无产阶级文化大革命群众运动的锻炼，在广大革命群众的帮助下，深刻地触及了自己的灵魂，世界观得到进一步的改造，已经和正在改正自己的错误。而那些混入干部队伍的叛徒、特务、反革命分子和顽固不化的走资派，只是一小撮。这就是我们对干部队伍的基本估计，是我们看待干部问题必须具备的无产阶级的阶级观点。
    只有从这种基本估计出发，我们才能够全面地、历史地考察干部，看主流，看大节，对干部作出切合实际的评价，把那些经过阶级斗争和两条路线斗争考验的优秀革命干部，放在关键性的岗位上，充分发挥他们在革命“三结合”中的骨干作用。
    只有从这种基本估计出发，我们才能够扩大教育面，正确地对待犯错误的干部，对他们实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的传统方针，耐心地教育和帮助他们改正错误，使他们站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    只有从这种基本估计出发，我们才能够正确地区分敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，团结绝大多数，集中力量，把矛头对准一小撮反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的反革命修正主义分子，对准那些混入干部队伍的叛徒、特务和反革命两面派，稳、准、狠地打击无产阶级的敌人。
    因此，也只有从这种基本估计出发，我们才能够在干部问题上，避免犯右的或极“左”的错误，既不忽视尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，认为干部统统都是好的，给右倾翻案黑风以可乘之隙；又不把干部队伍看得一团漆黑，怀疑一切，打倒一切，一有错误就一棍子打死。
    一切革命的干部，都不要辜负伟大领袖毛主席的关怀和期望，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，正确对待群众，正确对待自己，谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，永远当群众的小学生，同无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众一起，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗中为人民立新功。
