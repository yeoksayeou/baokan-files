Palestinian strike forces and guerrillas launched a joint attack on the enemy, fiercely assaulting an Israeli military camp and achieving the biggest victory since the start of their armed struggle.

	New China News Agency, Damascus, May 27th — The "Storm" strike force of the Palestinian nationalist organization "Fatah" and the guerrillas of the Palestine Liberation Organization jointly attacked the Israeli military camp at Tellel Najjar, northeast of Jericho on the West Bank of the Jordan River, in the early hours of the 25th. They killed and wounded 120 Israeli aggressor soldiers, achieving the biggest victory since the start of their armed struggle.

	According to reports, before the attack, the Palestinian guerrillas first bombarded the camp with rocket launchers and then charged in, using grenades and machine guns to annihilate the enemy troops inside. During the attack, the guerrillas destroyed two 106mm cannons, two jeeps, four half-track military vehicles, and other military equipment of the enemy.

	The Israeli aggressors hastily dispatched reinforcements, which were blown up by land mines pre-laid by the guerrillas, destroying three armored vehicles and killing all the aggressors on board.

	Before the joint attack on the 25th, the guerrillas were very active in the Jericho area. On the evening of the 20th, the "Storm" strike force launched a surprise attack on the Israeli paratrooper headquarters in Jericho, killing and wounding 20 Israeli aggressor soldiers. That same night, the guerrillas launched a rocket attack on a military ammunition depot near Jericho, causing a series of explosions.

	According to battle reports published by "Fatah" and reports from Syrian newspapers, from the 14th to the 23rd, the Palestinian guerrillas launched 12 attacks on the Israeli aggressor forces. They attacked enemy ammunition depots, military strongholds, airfields, and supply lines, killing and wounding 97 enemy soldiers, destroying 13 ammunition depots, seven half-track military vehicles, and seven other vehicles.

	The "Storm" strike force also frequently attacked another important Israeli aggressor base in the Besan Valley on the West Bank of the Jordan River. On the evening of the 25th, the guerrillas blew up an enemy military truck loaded with ammunition and a half-track military vehicle on a military road leading to the Besan Valley, killing nine enemy soldiers. On the evening of the 26th, the "Storm" strike force launched a rocket attack on the city of Besan, injuring many enemy soldiers. The guerrillas also shelled a newly built phosphate factory south of the Dead Sea, causing the enemy to suffer a loss of about 100,000 pounds.

	According to reports, the "Storm" strike force also attacked two enemy military camps south of Nasira in the Haifa region in the early hours of the 13th, killing and wounding 12 Israeli aggressor soldiers, destroying two granaries and many vehicles. In the early hours of the 16th, the guerrillas ambushed an enemy military convoy in the Bet Ummia region, destroying two half-track military vehicles and damaging three others.

    新华社大马士革二十七日电　巴勒斯坦民族主义组织“法塔赫”的“暴风”突击队和巴勒斯坦解放组织的游击队，二十五日凌晨对约旦河西岸杰里科东北的特勒纳贾尔的以色列兵营发动联合进攻，打死打伤以色列侵略军官兵一百二十名，取得了开展武装斗争以来最大的一次胜利。
    据宣布，巴勒斯坦游击队在进攻以前，先用火箭炮击这个兵营，然后冲上去，用手榴弹和机枪把兵营里的敌军全部消灭。在进攻中，游击队击毁敌军的两门一○六毫米大炮、两辆吉普车、四辆半履带式军车和其他军事装备。
    以色列侵略者慌忙赶派部队前去增援，途中又被游击队预先埋下的地雷炸毁了三辆装甲车，车上的侵略军全被炸死。
    在二十五日发动的联合进攻以前，游击队在杰里科地区非常活跃。二十日晚上，“暴风”突击队奇袭了杰里科的以色列伞兵总指挥部，打死打伤以色列侵略军二十名。当天晚上，游击队用火箭袭击了杰里科附近的军火库，引起连续爆炸。
    据“法塔赫”公布的战报和叙利亚报纸的报道，从十四日到二十三日，巴勒斯坦游击队向以色列侵略军发动了十二次袭击。他们袭击了敌军的军火库、军事据点、机场和交通线，打死打伤敌军九十七名，炸毁弹药库十三座、半履带式军车七辆和其他车辆七辆。
    “暴风”突击队还对约旦河西岸的另一个以色列侵略军重要基地贝桑河谷发动频繁的袭击。二十五日晚，游击队在通往贝桑河谷的军用公路上炸毁了一辆满载弹药的敌军卡车和一辆半履带式军车，打死敌军九名。二十六日晚，“暴风”突击队用火箭轰击贝桑城，杀伤了许多敌军。游击队还炮击了死海南面的一座新建的磷酸盐工厂，使敌人损失约十万英镑。
    据报道，“暴风”突击队在十三日深夜还袭击了海法地区纳西拉以南的两个敌军兵营，打死打伤以色列侵略军十二名，摧毁两座粮仓和许多车辆。十六日深夜，游击队在贝特乌米亚地区伏击一支敌军车队，击毁敌军的半履带式军车两辆，击伤三辆。
