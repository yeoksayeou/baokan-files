On the night of May 20, the people's liberation armed forces of South Vietnam shelled the U.S. military base at Thuan Hoa City, northwest of Thuan Hoa. In one strike, they destroyed over 150 U.S. aggressor aircraft, including many large helicopters.

This base is the forward command post of the U.S. invaders' First Cavalry Division (Airmobile). Many fuel depots, ammunition dumps, and barracks within the base were also hit by shells and set on fire, with the blaze burning for eight hours. According to reports, the people's liberation armed forces' artillery was both fierce and accurate, even flattening buildings several hundred meters away from the ammunition dump. Even four days after the shelling, the disheveled U.S. invaders were still frantically moving the damaged aircraft out of the base.

Thus, from April 19 to May 20 over a period of 31 days, the brave people's liberation armed forces of South Vietnam in the western part of Thuan Hoa Province, in the area of Highway 12, achieved the glorious feat of shooting down and destroying nearly 350 U.S. aggressor aircraft.

On May 25, the New China News Agency in Hanoi reported according to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam: The military and civilian people of Quang Tri and other provinces in South Vietnam have recently launched consecutive ambushes and attacks on the enemy, annihilating a large number of enemy forces.

In the first 18 days of May, the artillery units of the liberation army in the northern part of Quang Tri Province, with the support of the local people, closely coordinated with the infantry, fought over 100 battles. Together with the infantry units, they annihilated nearly 5,000 U.S. invaders, destroyed nearly 40 enemy vehicles, and many enemy warehouses.

The military and civilian people of the border counties of Long An, such as Ben Luc, on May 16 and 18, consecutively ambushed the enemy attempting to open Highway 4, annihilating over 350 enemy soldiers and seizing many weapons and military supplies.

The local forces and guerrilla units of Chi Linh County in this province fiercely shelled the enemy in Chi Linh County town on May 12, annihilating 200 enemy soldiers, burning down one enemy warehouse, and destroying nine bunkers.

The military and civilian people of Gia Dinh Province, on May 8 and 12, fiercely attacked the enemy west of Saigon, annihilating over 330 U.S. puppet soldiers, destroying 105 enemy tanks and armored vehicles, 13 cannons and mortars, and shooting down three enemy aircraft.

From May 5 to 12, the people's liberation armed forces in De Chu Military Sub-region to Thanh Phu Village on Highway 21 consecutively smashed the enemy's two "sweeping" operations, annihilating six companies of puppet soldiers, and seizing many weapons and military supplies.

On May 15, the local forces and guerrilla units of Phu Tho Commune in Chau Thanh County of Tay Ninh Province bravely ambushed the puppet soldiers who came for a "sweeping" operation, annihilating one enemy company and heavily damaging two companies.

On May 12, the local forces and guerrilla units of Chau Thanh County and Tan Hiep County in Dinh Tuong Province routed two companies of puppet special forces and one battalion of reinforcements in Minh Hoang Commune and Duong Xuan Commune, killing 120 enemy soldiers, wounding many, and destroying and damaging three armored vehicles.

On May 12, the military and civilian people in the southern part of Quang Nam Province ambushed the enemy attempting to open the road from Thuan Phu County town to Tam Ky City, annihilating two companies of puppet soldiers, heavily damaging one "self-defense" company and one special forces company, and seizing many weapons and military supplies.
