Western European progressive students continue to fight against the decayed educational system. Dockworkers in Savona, Italy, refuse to unload a ship from France in support of French workers and students' struggles.

BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) — Progressive students in Belgium, Italy, and Sweden continue their struggle against the decayed educational system.

In Brussels, Belgium, about 500 students from the University of Brussels, along with some professors, researchers, technical staff, and administrative personnel, have been demonstrating for four consecutive days. They demand that the university management committee be democratically elected by students, professors, technical staff, and administrative personnel. They have occupied the main lecture halls and the president's office. A student leader said they want to abolish the current management committee composed of "businessmen and financiers" because these people are trying to lead young students astray.

In Rome, Italy, students from the University of Rome have occupied the city's only student dormitory from May 24 to 26, demanding that the authorities build more dormitories and increase subsidies to improve the living conditions of about 30,000 students who are currently forced to live in other people's homes.

In Milan, hundreds of students have been occupying the university for three days to demand freedom of speech and participation in school management. They have set up barbed wire at the school gates and windows to prevent authorities from interfering.

In Savona, a port in northwestern Italy, dockworkers refused to unload a ship from a French port to show solidarity with French workers and students in their struggle.

In Stockholm, after a large-scale demonstration against the decayed educational system on May 25, 700 Swedish students continued to occupy a building they used as their headquarters on May 26. The Swedish ruling class is extremely anxious about the students' actions and threatens to use "strong measures" to suppress the student demonstrations. At the same time, the police have canceled their leave and are guarding the main buildings that the students plan to seize. More than a thousand people demonstrate in London in support of French workers and students

LONDON, May 26 (Xinhua) — More than a thousand people demonstrated in front of the French Embassy in London on May 26 to express their support for the French workers and students who are vigorously fighting against the reactionary policies of the French ruling class and the decayed capitalist system.

The demonstrators were mostly young workers and students. They marched from the University of London, singing "The Internationale" and chanting slogans such as "We will fight, we will win," and "Today it's France, tomorrow it will be Britain!"

The demonstrators clashed with the police near the French Embassy. More than 20 people were arrested by the police.

That evening, many of the demonstrators marched again to the police station to demand the release of those who were unjustly arrested.

    西欧进步学生再接再厉反对腐朽教育制度
    意大利萨沃纳港码头工人拒绝为来自法国的轮船卸货声援法工人和学生斗争
    新华社二十七日讯  比利时、意大利、瑞典等国的进步学生继续坚持斗争，反对腐朽的教育制度。
    比利时布鲁塞尔大学约五百名学生在一些教授、研究员、技术和行政管理人员的参加下，已经连续四天举行示威，要求由学生、教授、技术人员和行政管理人员来民主地选举大学管理委员会。他们占领着学校的主要讲堂和校长办公室。一位学生领袖说，他们要求抛弃目前由“企业主和金融家”组成的管理委员会，因为这些人企图把青年学生引上邪路。
    意大利罗马大学学生从二十四日到二十六日占领了罗马全市唯一的一栋学生公寓，要求当局给学生建造更多的宿舍和增加补助金，改善目前被迫在别人家里寄宿的大约三万名学生的处境。
    米兰大学数百名学生为要求言论自由和参与学校管理而占领学校的行动，到二十六日为止已经坚持了三天。他们在学校门口和窗前布设了铁丝网，以阻止当局进行干涉。
    意大利西北部萨沃纳港的码头工人为表示对斗争中的法国工人和学生的声援，拒绝为来自法国港口的轮船卸货。
    在斯德哥尔摩，继二十五日举行了抗议腐朽的教育制度的大规模示威后，七百名瑞典大学生二十六日仍然占据着他们作为总部的一所大楼。瑞典统治集团对学生的行动极为恐慌，威胁要用“强硬手段”镇压学生的示威。同时，警察取消了休假，看守着示威学生准备夺取的主要大楼。英国伦敦一千多公众示威支持法国工人学生正义斗争
    新华社伦敦二十六日电　英国公众一千多人二十六日在法国驻伦敦大使馆前面示威，表示支持法国工人和学生正在轰轰烈烈地开展的反对法国统治集团的反动政策和腐朽的资本主义制度的正义斗争。
    示威者大都是青年工人和学生。他们从伦敦大学出发，列队游行，通过闹市，沿途高唱《国际歌》，并且高呼口号：“我们要战斗，我们将胜利”，“今天是法国，明天就是英国！”
    示威队伍在法国大使馆附近同前去镇压的警察进行了英勇的斗争。有二十多人被警察逮捕。
    当天晚上，许多参加示威的群众又列队游行，到警察局去要求释放被无理逮捕的人。
