Colombian revolutionary people warmly welcome Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. Chairman Mao and the oppressed people of the world are heart to heart. The oppressed people of the world should unite, take up arms, and wage revolutionary struggle until victory.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated May 1, Bogota: The revolutionary people of Colombia, after reading Chairman Mao's statement on April 16 supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence, felt elated and inspired. They expressed that Chairman Mao's statement "once again proves that Chairman Mao and the oppressed people of the world are heart to heart." Mao Zedong Thought is "the beacon and sunshine illuminating the path of world revolutionary struggle."

	A Colombian metallurgical worker said, "Chairman Mao's statement once again proves that Chairman Mao and the oppressed people of the world are heart to heart." He said: To have Chairman Mao, who has such far-sighted wisdom, as our leader is the greatest fortune for the oppressed people of the world. Chairman Mao, with the revolutionary profundity inherent in his boundless thought, guides the revolutionary struggle against American imperialism.

	Another worker said, "The event of the American black pastor Martin Luther King being murdered by the counter-revolutionary violence of American monopolistic forces has taught American blacks that only through revolutionary violent struggle can they defeat the demon of American monopolistic forces that oppresses people." He said, "This is also a lesson for the people of the world, that only through revolutionary armed struggle can the exploitative system established by American imperialism be permanently eliminated. This is the only path for all oppressed people to achieve thorough liberation."

	A Colombian revolutionary, when talking about Chairman Mao's statement, said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon and sunshine illuminating the path of world revolutionary struggle. Every time Chairman Mao points out the path to thoroughly defeat American imperialism to the people of various countries, the hearts of revolutionaries all over the world beat fiercely. American imperialism is the number one enemy of all mankind and is already on its last legs. The declaration of our red sun in our hearts clearly proves to us that the broad masses of the oppressed are the decisive factor in the struggle." He said, "The struggle of more than twenty million American blacks has shaken this imperialist powerhouse, just as Chairman Mao said: 'This storm of black people's struggle occurring within the United States is a prominent manifestation of the current political and economic crises of American imperialism. It deals a heavy blow to American imperialism, which is beset with internal and external difficulties.'"

	This revolutionary went on to say, "The oppression of American imperialism has united the people of many countries in the world, 'under the guidance of the great helmsman Chairman Mao Zedong, to wage the final struggle.' He said: 'We should be highly aware that we, the people of the world, should firmly unite and resist this demon that attempts to devour us.' 'When American imperialism is in its death throes, the only path left for us is, as Chairman Mao pointed out, to take up arms and wage revolutionary struggle until victory.'"

	A Colombian revolutionary peasant said, "I am very happy to see Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. The struggle of American blacks in the heart of this imperialist demon supports our struggle, and we should also support them with our struggle to overthrow American imperialism in Colombia. Whether it is American blacks or all the people of the world, we should firmly believe that only by using revolutionary violence to counter the counter-revolutionary violence of the monopolistic bourgeoisie can we achieve victory. We have such experience here: in the struggle against the reactionary violence of imperialism and its running dogs, once we are disarmed, the reactionaries will not hesitate to kill us." He went on to say, "Chairman Mao resolutely supports American blacks and calls on all those oppressed by the monopolistic bourgeoisie in the United States and all those exploited by American imperialism in the world to unite. This shows his great thought to us. We are extremely moved to welcome Chairman Mao's statement. This statement inspires us to fight more wholeheartedly under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, making every necessary sacrifice."

	This revolutionary peasant finally said: "Chairman Mao's statement has great historical significance for the struggle of American blacks and all the American people, and for the struggle of the people of the world." He shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America!"

　　哥伦比亚革命人民热烈欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明
　　毛主席和全世界被压迫人民心连心
　　被压迫人民联合起来拿起武器展开革命斗争直到胜利
    据新华社一日讯　波哥大消息：哥伦比亚革命人民在读了毛主席四月十六日发表的支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明后感到欢欣鼓舞，他们表示，毛主席的这一声明“再次证明，毛主席和全世界被压迫人民是心连心的”，毛泽东思想是“照亮世界革命斗争道路的灯塔和阳光”。
    一位哥伦比亚冶金工人说，毛主席的声明“再次证明，毛主席和全世界被压迫人民是心连心的。”他说：能够有毛泽东主席这样有远见卓识的导师，这是全世界被压迫人民的莫大幸福。毛主席以他威力无边的思想所固有的革命的精辟性，指导着反对美帝国主义的革命斗争。
    另一位工人说，美国黑人牧师马丁·路德·金被美国垄断势力用反革命暴力杀害这一事件“教训了美国黑人，使他们懂得，只有通过革命暴力斗争，才能打垮美国垄断势力这个压迫人的魔鬼。”他说，这“对全世界人民也是一个教训，就是只有通过革命武装斗争才能永远消灭美帝国主义建立的剥削制度。这是所有被压迫人民争取彻底解放的唯一道路。”
    一位哥伦比亚革命者在谈到毛主席的声明时说，毛泽东思想“是照亮世界革命斗争道路的灯塔和阳光。每当毛主席向各国人民指出彻底打败美帝国主义的道路时，全世界革命者的心都激烈跳动。美帝国主义是全人类的头号敌人，已经奄奄一息。我们心中的红太阳的声明向我们明确证明，广大被压迫群众是斗争中的决定因素。”他说，两千多万美国黑人斗争震撼了这个帝国主义强国，正如毛主席所说：“这场黑人的斗争风暴发生在美国国内，是美帝国主义当前整个政治危机和经济危机的一个突出表现。它给陷于内外交困的美帝国主义以沉重的打击。”
    这位革命者接着说，美帝国主义的压迫把世界许多国家的人民联合起来，“在我们的伟大统帅毛泽东主席的思想指引下，展开最后的斗争。”他说：“我们应该高度觉悟到，我们全世界人民应该坚定不移地联合起来，抵抗企图吞灭我们的这个魔鬼。”“当美帝国主义在垂死挣扎的时候，我们剩下的唯一道路，就是象毛主席所指出的，拿起武器，展开革命斗争，直到胜利。”
    一位哥伦比亚革命农民说，我看到毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明感到非常高兴。美国黑人在美帝国主义这个魔鬼的心脏开展的斗争是对我们的斗争的支持，我们也应该用我们在哥伦比亚推翻美帝国主义的斗争支持他们。无论是美国黑人或是我们全世界人民都应该坚信，只有用革命的暴力反击垄断资产阶级的反革命暴力，我们才可能获胜。在我们这里就有这样的经验：在反对帝国主义及其走狗的反动暴力的斗争中一旦解除武装，反动派就毫不犹豫地杀害我们。他接着说，毛主席“坚决支持美国黑人，号召美国所有受垄断资产阶级压迫的人、全世界受美帝国主义剥削的人联合起来，这向我们表明了他的伟大思想。我们万分激动地欢迎毛泽东主席的这个声明。这个声明鼓舞我们在毛泽东思想的指引下，不惜一切必要的牺牲，更加全心全意地进行斗争。”
    这位革命农民最后说：“毛主席的声明对美国黑人和全体美国人民的斗争，对全世界人民的斗争具有伟大的历史意义。”他高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“亚非拉革命人民万岁！”
