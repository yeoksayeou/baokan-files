Over a thousand Palestinians held a mass rally on the evening of April 4 in the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp on the outskirts of Damascus to commemorate the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the battle against Israeli aggressors on March 21 this year. They also expressed their determination to complete the martyrs' unfinished mission by waging armed struggle to liberate their homeland and rid themselves of the American imperialist tool, Israel.

A representative of the Palestine Liberation Movement spoke at the rally. He condemned U.S. imperialism for supporting Israel against the Palestinian people. He said, "We will face all the challenges posed by U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism cannot stop the Palestinian people from continuing their struggle."

He pointed out, "The United Nations cannot solve the Palestinian problem because it is controlled by imperialism."

He said, "The Palestinian people are determined to continue the struggle. The 'Storm' commandoes will continue to raise the banner of armed struggle until they completely eliminate the Israeli aggressors and achieve final victory."

Members of the 'Storm' commandoes and other Palestinian youth also spoke at the rally, expressing their determination to fight and defeat the aggressors. They pointed out that more and more Palestinian people are joining the armed struggle to liberate their homeland.

In another report, Syrian Prime Minister Yusuf Zu'ayyin, speaking at a mass rally held on May 1 at the Tradas station in the Jazira administrative district, said, "Armed struggle and people's war are the path to liberate the Arab lands occupied by Israel. Time has proven that this path is correct."

Zu'ayyin pointed out, "Our enemy is Zionism and imperialism led by the United States." He condemned U.S. imperialism for providing Israel with weapons of aggression.

Zu'ayyin said, "The only path to peace in the Middle East is to permanently end imperialist aggression and the various forms of imperialism."

He paid tribute to the indomitable spirit of the Arab people in the West Bank and other regions occupied by Israel. He called on the Arab people to fully support the struggle of the Palestinian commandoes.

He said, "People are the foundation. Those who are inseparable from their land fight with a strong will, determining the outcome of the war. This outcome does not depend on aircraft or technology."

Zu'ayyin emphasized, "We clearly and frankly declare here that the broad masses of the Arab people reject defeat and surrender, and are determined to achieve victory, no matter how great the sacrifices and how long the struggle."

He expressed his respect for the Vietnamese people who are bravely fighting against U.S. imperialism, and for all the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting for anti-imperialism and complete liberation.
