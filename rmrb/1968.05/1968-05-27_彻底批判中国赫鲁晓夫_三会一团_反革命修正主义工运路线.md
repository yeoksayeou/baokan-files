On the eve of our country's revolutionary victory, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "After the Chinese revolution achieves nationwide victory, the basic contradiction within the country will be between the working class and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao also taught us: "In this historical stage of socialism, class struggle, class contradictions, and class struggle still exist. There is a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, and there is the danger of capitalist restoration." The essence of this struggle is still the question of power, that is, the proletariat must strengthen the proletarian dictatorship, while the bourgeoisie wants to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship.

Since the founding of the nation, there has been a fierce struggle between two lines in the work of the trade unions.

Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, the revolutionary mass organizations of the working class must take Mao Zedong Thought as their guiding principle, under the leadership of the Party, build a highly revolutionary working-class force, and struggle to consolidate the proletarian dictatorship, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and carry the socialist revolution through to the end. The revolutionary mass organizations of the working class are the backbone of the Party in uniting the broad masses of workers to fight against the class enemy, and they are the great school where the broad masses of workers study and apply Mao Zedong Thought.

The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the trade unions have persistently pushed a counterrevolutionary revisionist labor line in the work of the trade unions, that is: to abolish class struggle, oppose proletarian dictatorship, oppose emphasizing proletarian politics, alter the class nature of the trade unions, oppose Party leadership, and promote "production unions," "welfare unions," and "all-people's unions." They also advocate trade unionism. In the end, they oppose guiding the workers' movement with Mao Zedong Thought and attempt to lead the workers' movement down the road to capitalist restoration. This counterrevolutionary revisionist line has spread widely and must be thoroughly criticized.

The essence of the "production union" is to abolish class struggle

Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, whether the workers' movement takes class struggle as the key is a focal point of the struggle between the two labor lines.

According to the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "politics is the commander, the soul," the workers' movement must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take class struggle as the key, strengthen and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship, and firmly grasp the leadership of socialist enterprises in the hands of the proletariat. This will promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, mobilize the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of workers, and build socialism quickly, efficiently, economically, and well. Lenin said: "Politics, compared to economics, cannot but occupy the primary position." "If a class does not correctly handle political issues, it cannot maintain its rule and thus cannot solve its production tasks." That is to say, the relationship between politics and economics, revolution and production, in terms of importance, revolution should be placed first, as the primary issue. The working class can only continuously grasp class struggle, consolidate the proletarian dictatorship, and carry the socialist revolution through to the end, in order to continuously liberate the productive forces, develop production, and ensure that the country's economic construction advances along the socialist road.

The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the trade unions have always frantically opposed Mao Zedong Thought and opposed emphasizing proletarian politics. Since liberation, they have used the pretext of "production and construction" to oppose the class struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and oppose the socialist revolution. They have used the reactionary program of "production movement is the workers' movement" to promote "production unions," claiming that as long as they grasp "production," they have grasped the "direction" of the workers' movement. Every time the class struggle reaches a critical moment, they raise the banner of "production first" to try to extinguish the blazing revolutionary flames.

The absurd theory of "production movement is the workers' movement" that the Chinese Khrushchev has repeatedly emphasized is extremely reactionary.

Chairman Mao taught us that the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power. After the proletariat seizes power, the most important task is to firmly grasp class struggle, strengthen and consolidate proletarian power, and carry out class struggle in all fields in a comprehensive and in-depth manner. This will raise the awareness of the masses of workers in class struggle and line struggle, grasp revolution, and promote production. Only in this way can socialist construction be successfully carried out. Otherwise, there is the danger of losing power and the danger of capitalist restoration. The Chinese Khrushchev does not mention socialist revolution or class struggle, opposes using revolution to guide production, and talks about "production movement is the workers' movement." This leads the working class and the laboring people to only focus on "production" and ignore class struggle, abandoning the attack on the class enemy. The result is that socialist economic construction not only cannot be developed but will also lead to the degeneration and transformation of socialist economy, leading to capitalist restoration.

What kind of goods is the "production movement" that the Chinese Khrushchev repeatedly emphasizes? Social production cannot be separated from a certain mode of production. The so-called "development of production" by the Chinese Khrushchev is essentially the development of capitalism. In the early days of national liberation, his "production movement" was to have the "working class cooperate with capitalists" and "allow capitalists to exist and develop for dozens of years." He attempted to bring the workers' movement onto the capitalist track to serve the development of capitalism. After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the means of production, his "production movement" was to use technical leadership, money leadership, and fame leadership, to carry out "peaceful evolution," and follow in the footsteps of Soviet revisionism. For this purpose, he widely advocated that "revolution is almost done," and now it is "technology first." He also openly told workers: as long as you have a "skill," you can be a "hero" or a "model," and you can be a "factory director" or a "minister." In short, his "production movement" is to oppose emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought, oppose emphasizing proletarian politics, and to achieve capitalist restoration in our country. Under his reactionary slogan of "good production is good politics," thousands of capitalists became "advanced producers." Is it not clear what kind of goods the "production union" is?

All revisionists, from Bernstein, Kautsky, Tito, to Khrushchev, have always advocated "production first," "technology first," and opposed class struggle. They view the development of society as merely the development of production tools and production technology, denying that class struggle is the driving force of social development. When the working class had not yet seized power, they used the excuse of "underdeveloped production" to oppose the struggle to seize power; after the working class seized power, they vigorously advocated the absurd theory of "production first," "technology first," and opposed carrying the socialist revolution through to the end. The "production movement is the workers' movement" proposed by the Chinese Khrushchev is merely a piece of junk from the old and new revisionists, a thoroughly counterrevolutionary economism.

The "production union" of the Chinese Khrushchev is essentially to abolish class struggle and sabotage socialist production and construction. We settle accounts with and criticize the "production union" precisely to better implement Chairman Mao's great strategic line of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness." Revolution is the locomotive driving production forward. The mass organizations of the working class must, on the premise that revolution guides production, promote the development of production. The Chinese Khrushchev, under the banner of "developing production," has always sabotaged socialist production. At present, in the great situation of seizing a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of class enemies are trying to use various vile means to sabotage production, undermine the socialist economic base, and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The proletarian revolutionary faction must be highly vigilant and, while launching a proactive offensive against the class enemy, also launch a proactive offensive in production. We must, with the actual actions of firmly grasping revolution and vigorously promoting production, resolutely counterattack the enemy's offensive and welcome a new upsurge in socialist production and construction.

"The welfare union" is a "sugar-coated bullet" to corrupt the working class

Is it politics that takes the lead or welfare that takes the lead? This is another focal point of the struggle between the two labor lines under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Politics is the commander, the soul." "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." "We should educate the comrades in the trade unions and the masses of workers to understand that they must not only see the immediate and partial welfare and forget the long-term interests of the working class."

The Chinese Khrushchev opposes Chairman Mao's great instructions and, together with a small group of his agents in the trade unions, put forward a set of programs with welfare as the lead, promoting "welfare unions." He first vigorously advocated that after liberation, the trade unions are "economic organizations of the entire working class" and are "established to solve immediate demands." They also shouted: after the working class seizes power, "protecting the material interests and democratic rights of the working masses" is the "unique task" of the trade unions.

"Caring for the masses' lives" is the teaching of the great leader Chairman Mao. Our Party has always been very concerned about the immediate interests of the broad masses of workers and the issues of their lives. However, we firmly oppose the bourgeoisie's welfare leadership. We should first actively guide the masses of workers to care about the class interests of the proletariat, the interests of the revolution, and tirelessly raise the political awareness of the working class to struggle for the great ideal of communism. The so-called "care" of the Chinese Khrushchev is merely an attempt to use small favors to induce the masses to forget consolidating the proletarian dictatorship and forget the historical mission of the working class, so as to facilitate their counterrevolutionary conspiracy to usurp the Party and the country and restore capitalism!

For this counterrevolutionary purpose, whenever the class enemies at home and abroad fiercely attack the Party and socialism, they seize the opportunity to spread the black wind of counterrevolutionary economism and plot to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship. Soon after the Hungarian incident in 1956, the Chinese Khrushchev personally took the lead and shouted about "focusing on distribution after solving the ownership issue." On the eve of the anti-rightist struggle in 1957, he put on a face of "caring" for the masses' interests, inciting trade union cadres to "run around and shout" for the "interests of the masses" and be willing to "get their heads broken and bleed," attempting to incite the masses to oppose the Party and socialism. When our country's economy encountered temporary difficulties, they became even more unscrupulous in attacking the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the three red banners of the people's communes, saying that since 1958, "politics has been overemphasized," "ideological work must have a material foundation," and so on, opposing the emphasis on proletarian politics, opposing the Party's line of socialist construction, and opposing the socialist revolution.

Over the past eighteen years, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the trade unions have also been vigorously promoting "cultural welfare" under the black flag, using literature, sports, recuperation, education, and other channels to inject a large amount of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism poison into the working masses. They allowed emperors, generals, and talented scholars to occupy the stage of the workers' cultural palace. They vigorously advocated championship and fame leadership in workers' sports. They made the workers' recuperation centers only care about "eating well, playing well, and resting well." They also made the workers' evening schools "only talk about X-rays, not Marx," striving to guide workers to take the white specialist road, and so on.

These facts fully prove that over the past decade or so, the so-called labor policy of "production as the center, production, life, and education as a whole" that they have carefully designed and stubbornly insisted on is precisely the embodiment of the "production union" and "welfare union" of the Chinese Khrushchev. All of these are pure counterrevolutionary economism and are "sugar-coated bullets" aimed at the working class!

The historical experience of the workers' movement proves that all kinds of labor traitors in the world have never failed to use the pretext of "caring for workers' welfare" to sell out the class interests of the working class. The working class of China has personally experienced in the practice of revolutionary struggle that only by firmly grasping the knife and seal of the proletarian dictatorship in their own hands can they be the most reliable guarantee of the interests of the working class. As Comrade Lin Biao said: "With power, the proletariat and the laboring people have everything. Without power, they lose everything." "Forgetting power is forgetting politics, forgetting the fundamental viewpoint of Marxism, and becoming economism, anarchism, and utopianism." The Chinese Khrushchev's promotion of the "welfare union" is precisely to make the working class compromise with immediate interests, forget fundamental interests, lose their power, and make China return to the old road of colonialism and semi-colonialism. In that situation, what "welfare" can the working class talk about?

"The all-people's union" is a bourgeois union

The trade union is a tool of class struggle. In the workers' movement, although there are various factions of trade unions, there are basically only two sides: either the proletarian trade union or the bourgeois trade union. As long as classes exist, there can be no trade union that is above class and all-people's. Whether in capitalist society or in socialist society, there has never been a so-called "all-people's union" that represents the interests of various classes. The proletarian trade union is, under the leadership of the proletarian party, an organization that unites the broad masses of workers to carry out class struggle.

The "all-people's union" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev is a tool for him to promote the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie and is a tool for the bourgeoisie to oppose the proletariat. He, starting from the reactionary theory of "extinction of class struggle," advocates the establishment of a classless, all-embracing "all-people's union."

Chairman Mao has long taught us to build a "strong class union" and to "be on guard against thieves and prevent reactionary special agents from infiltrating the union." The Chinese Khrushchev opposes Chairman Mao's wise teachings. In the early days of liberation, he publicly advocated that the trade union "should not have political conditions" and that "as long as one is a wage laborer, one can join." Under his pretext of "wage laborers," he blurs class boundaries, abandons class analysis, and pulls in people with serious political and historical problems from the Kuomintang "retained personnel," as well as bourgeois professors and experts, giving them the legal cover of the "working class." After the basic completion of the three socialist transformations, he said: "The contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie has been resolved," "the property of the capitalists has been handed over, and they are no longer capitalists," vigorously advocating the absorption of bourgeois elements into the trade union as a form of "political arrangement."

After the socialist education movement was deeply carried out nationwide, the Chinese Khrushchev and his ilk put forward the reactionary theory of "class assimilation." At that time, the reactionary revisionist Peng Zhen, who was in charge of the work of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, actually said at the 1964 provincial, municipal, and autonomous region trade union directors' meeting: the working class itself is constantly assimilating landlords, capitalists, small officials, old policemen, and so on into the working class. Peng Zhen's reactionary fallacy was supported by the Chinese Khrushchev. The Chinese Khrushchev attempted to bring all landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists into his "all-people's union," allowing them to stir up trouble and refusing to be reformed. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, some people even openly shouted: "I have a 'red faction pass' (membership card), I am a member of the working class, I do not admit that I am an exploiter!" Look! The "all-people's union" that the Chinese Khrushchev wants to establish is whose union, is it not clear?

Lenin said: "In whose hands the power is, this determines everything." In the trade union organization, it is the same. The Chinese Khrushchev openly fought for the bourgeoisie to seize the leadership of the trade union. He shouted: members of the democratic parties "have the right to be elected to the leadership of the trade union" and "can and should take on the leadership of the trade union." His lackeys even used the excuse of "caring for united front objects" to stuff some bourgeois intellectuals who had not been reformed into the leadership of the trade union to take on leadership positions. They handed over the leadership of the workers' movement to bourgeois intellectuals precisely to alter the class nature of the trade union and make the trade union a tool for the bourgeoisie to oppose the proletariat.

Trade unionism is to turn the trade union into an "independent kingdom"

Whether the mass organizations of the working class should accept the leadership of the proletarian party is a serious struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie over the leadership of the workers' movement.

Our great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "The Communist Party of China is the core of the leadership of the entire Chinese people. Without such a core, the cause of socialism cannot be victorious." The proletarian party is the vanguard of the proletariat armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and it is the highest organizational form of the proletariat. Only under the leadership of its vanguard can the proletariat form an independent political force, ascend to the historical stage of class struggle, and oppose the exploitation and oppression of the bourgeoisie. After seizing power, the mass organizations of the working class can only, under the leadership of the Party, become a socialist pillar of the proletarian dictatorship.

The Chinese Khrushchev, in order to restore capitalism, desperately struggled with the Party for the leadership of the workers' movement. He has always vigorously promoted trade unionism, opposed Party leadership, and tried to turn the trade union into a counterrevolutionary "independent kingdom" controlled by the bourgeoisie command.

Trade unionism is an opportunist faction in the workers' movement and a bourgeois reactionary trend. It places the trade union above the proletarian party and treats it as the sole leadership form of the workers' movement. Trade unionists deny the leadership of the proletarian party, limit the workers' movement to economic struggle, oppose political struggle to seize power, and abandon the socialist revolution. After the October Revolution, the anarchist trade unionists in Russia, supported by Trotsky and Bukharin, appeared in the guise of the "workers' opposition," advocating "the trade union is above all," "the trade union manages everything." In fact, this was a counterrevolutionary clique opposing the Soviet power.

Lenin sharply pointed out: "Anarchist trade unionism is the brother of opportunism." The trade unionist junk that has long been denounced by Lenin is regarded as a "treasure" by the Chinese Khrushchev. He enthusiastically advocated that the Party can only "assist" the trade union and cannot "lead" it, repeatedly emphasizing that the trade union should establish an independent "system leadership." Under the protection of the Chinese Khrushchev, a small group of capitalist-roaders who have entrenched themselves in the All-China Federation of Trade Unions also followed suit in advocating the "independence of the trade union." They arrogantly shouted: the trade union and the Party are "parallel," the trade union cannot accept the Party's "assignment, orders, and interference," but should have its own "system leadership." The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the All-China Federation of Trade Unions also vigorously advocated the reactionary theory of the "main force," claiming: the Party "only includes the advanced part of the working class" and "is not the 'main force' of the working class," while the trade union "almost includes all members of the working class" and can also be said to be the "main force" of the working class. Therefore, "it cannot be said that the Party can lead, the working class cannot lead." They even demanded that the trade union "increasingly" "perform the duties of state organs" and exercise "trade union supervision" over the government. Based on these reactionary fallacies, they dressed themselves up as representatives of the "main force" of the class and representatives of the interests of the working class, creating a counterrevolutionary "independent kingdom." How similar this is to the counterrevolutionary program of the "workers' opposition"!

The trade unionist fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, after being criticized and resisted, in 1958, he had to change his counterrevolutionary methods and put forward the slogan of making the trade union a "tame tool" of the Party. The so-called "tame tool" is essentially a plot to firmly control the trade union under the leadership of the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois command and make it a counterrevolutionary tool against Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. For a long time, a small group of capitalist-roaders within the All-China Federation of Trade Unions have been disobeying and refusing to implement the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee; they have been bowing down to the Chinese Khrushchev and his gang, following them step by step. Such a "tame tool" is not a bourgeois "independent kingdom" that opposes the proletarian command headed by Chairman Mao?

What "independence theory," "main force theory," and "tame tool theory" are all counterrevolutionary fallacies of restoring capitalism. Whether in capitalist society or in socialist society, there is fundamentally no trade union that is independent of any party. It is either accepting the leadership of the proletarian party or the leadership of the bourgeois party. This is an objective law of class struggle that is not subject to human will. The Chinese Khrushchev desperately peddles trade unionist fallacies, denies that the Party is the highest organizational form of the proletariat, and attempts to fundamentally deny the Party's leadership of the trade union, thereby bringing the trade union into his track of restoring capitalism.

The mass organizations of the working class must firmly follow the leadership of the Party, act according to the fundamental interests of the working class, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, be infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They must not allow the reactionary trend of anarchist trade unionism to poison our fighting mass organizations of the working class revolution.

Over the past eighteen years, the struggle between the two lines in the work of the trade unions in our country has focused on one point: whether to take Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle. This is the most fundamental issue that determines the direction and path of the workers' movement.

Lenin said: "Only the revolutionary Marxist theory can become the banner of the workers' movement." Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards worldwide victory. It is the guiding principle for all our work. The workers' movement, if it deviates from Mao Zedong Thought, will definitely lose its way, and all the revolutionary achievements that the working class has gained will be in vain and destroyed in an instant.

The field of labor is an important battleground for the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. As Lenin said: "Since the working masses themselves cannot create an independent system of ideas in the course of their movement, the question can only be: either the bourgeoisie's system of ideas or the socialist system of ideas." The "three unions and one league" revisionist labor line proposed and promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev is precisely the bourgeois system of ideas and is the concentrated expression of counterrevolutionary economism in the workers' movement. The Chinese Khrushchev and his ilk, in order to promote the counterrevolutionary revisionist labor line, concentratedly opposed guiding the workers' movement with Mao Zedong Thought. They shamelessly slandered and attacked Mao Zedong Thought, opposed guiding the workers' movement with Mao Zedong Thought, and frantically opposed the mass movement of the broad masses of workers to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. They attempted to degenerate the socialist workers' movement into a spontaneous movement of bourgeois trade unionism and thus open the way for them to restore capitalism. Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "Mao Zedong Thought is not spontaneously produced by the laboring people," "it is necessary to study and apply Chairman Mao's works to instill Chairman Mao's thoughts into the workers and peasants, to change the spiritual outlook of the laboring people, and to turn spiritual power into tremendous material power." The eighteen-year practice of the struggle between the two lines in the workers' movement in our country has provided us with rich experience in the workers' movement under the dictatorship of the proletariat. The fundamental of the fundamental is that the workers' movement must take Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle. For this reason, the mass organizations of the working class must always put the organization of workers to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the first place in all work, and instill Mao Zedong Thought into the working masses. Only in this way can we fundamentally guarantee the Party's leadership of the workers' movement, implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, resist the infiltration of various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas into the workers' movement, and turn the mass organizations of the working class into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. This will build a vigorous, highly revolutionary, and highly combative working-class force.

    彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫“三会一团”反革命修正主义工运路线
    中华全国总工会“大联委”
    在我国革命胜利前夕，我们伟大的领袖毛主席就英明地指出：中国革命在取得全国的胜利之后，国内的基本矛盾是“工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾”。毛主席还教导我们：“在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。”这一斗争的本质，仍然是政权问题，即无产阶级要大力巩固无产阶级专政，资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政。
    建国以来，在工会工作中一直存在着两条路线的激烈斗争。
    在无产阶级专政条件下，工人阶级的革命群众组织必须以毛泽东思想为指导方针，在党的领导下，建设成一支非常革命化的工人阶级队伍，为巩固无产阶级专政，巩固工农联盟，把社会主义革命进行到底而斗争。工人阶级的革命群众组织是党团结广大职工群众向阶级敌人进行斗争的中坚力量，是广大职工群众活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校。
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其在工会中的代理人，在工会工作中顽固地推行一条反革命修正主义工运路线，即：取消阶级斗争，反对无产阶级专政，反对突出无产阶级政治，篡改工会的阶级性质，反对党的领导，大办“生产工会”、“福利工会”、“全民工会”，大搞工团主义。归根到底，就是反对用毛泽东思想指导工人运动，妄图把工人运动引向复辟资本主义的道路。这条反革命修正主义路线流毒甚广，必须彻底批判。
    “生产工会”的实质是取消阶级斗争
    在无产阶级专政条件下，工人运动是不是以阶级斗争为纲，是两条工运路线斗争的一个焦点。
    根据伟大领袖毛主席关于“政治是统帅，是灵魂”的教导，工人运动必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以阶级斗争为纲，加强和巩固无产阶级专政，把社会主义企业领导权牢牢掌握在无产阶级手中，促进人的思想革命化，调动广大职工的革命精神，多快好省地建设社会主义。列宁说：“政治同经济相比不能不占首位”，“一个阶级如果不从政治上正确地处理问题，就不能维持它的统治，因而也就不能解决它的生产任务。”就是说，政治和经济、革命和生产的关系，就重要性来说，革命应摆在首位，是第一位的问题。工人阶级只有不断抓阶级斗争，巩固无产阶级专政，把社会主义革命进行到底，才能不断地解放生产力，发展生产，保证国家的经济建设沿着社会主义的道路前进。
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其在工会中的代理人，一贯疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，反对突出无产阶级政治。解放以来，他们打着“生产建设”的幌子，反对无产阶级对资产阶级的阶级斗争，反对社会主义革命。他们以所谓“生产运动就是工人运动”的反动纲领，大办“生产工会”，胡说什么，抓住了“生产”，就是抓住了工人运动的“方向”。每当阶级斗争的关键时刻，他们就祭起“生产第一”的法宝，妄图扑灭熊熊的革命烈火。
    中国赫鲁晓夫竭力鼓吹的“生产运动就是工人运动”的谬论是极端反动的。
    毛主席教导我们，革命的根本问题是政权问题。无产阶级在夺取政权以后，头等重要的大事，就是要牢牢抓住阶级斗争，加强和巩固无产阶级的政权，并在各个领域中全面地、深入地开展阶级斗争，提高职工群众的阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟，狠抓革命，猛促生产，才能胜利地进行社会主义建设。否则，就有丧失政权的危险，就有资本主义复辟的危险。中国赫鲁晓夫闭口不谈社会主义革命，不讲阶级斗争，反对用革命来统帅生产，侈谈“生产运动就是工人运动”，引诱工人阶级和劳动人民只顾埋头“生产”，不问阶级斗争，放弃对阶级敌人的进攻。其结果，社会主义经济建设非但不能得到发展，反而会引起社会主义经济的蜕化、变质，导致资本主义复辟。
    中国赫鲁晓夫再三强调“生产运动”，他鼓吹的“生产运动”到底是什么货色呢？社会生产都不可能离开一定的生产方式。中国赫鲁晓夫的所谓“发展生产”，实质上就是发展资本主义。全国解放初期，他的“生产运动”就是要“工人阶级和资本家合作”，“让资本家存在和发展几十年”，企图把工人运动纳入资本主义轨道，为发展资本主义效劳。生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成后，他的“生产运动”就是用技术挂帅、金钱挂帅、名利挂帅，大搞“和平演变”，步苏联修正主义的后尘。为了这个目的，他大肆宣扬“革命是搞得差不多了”，现在是“技术第一”。他还公开向工人宣扬：只要“有一门本事”，“就可以是英雄或者是模范”，就可以当“厂长”、“部长”。一句话，他的“生产运动”，就是反对突出毛泽东思想，反对突出无产阶级政治，要在我国实现资本主义复辟。在他的“生产好就是政治好”的反动口号下，竟然有几千资本家当上了“先进生产者”。“生产工会”究竟是那一路货色，岂不是很清楚了吗？
    一切修正主义者，伯恩斯坦、考茨基、铁托、赫鲁晓夫之流，从来就鼓吹“生产第一”、“技术第一”，反对阶级斗争。他们把社会的发展只是看作生产工具和生产技术的发展，否认阶级斗争是社会发展的动力。当着工人阶级尚未取得政权时，他们借口“生产不发达”，反对夺取政权的斗争；当着工人阶级夺取政权后，他们竭力宣扬“生产第一”、“技术第一”的谬论，反对把社会主义革命进行到底。中国赫鲁晓夫提出的“生产运动就是工人运动”只不过是从新老修正主义那里拣来的早已破产了的“生产力论”的破烂货，是彻头彻尾的反革命经济主义。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的“生产工会”，实质是取消阶级斗争，破坏社会主义生产建设。我们清算和批判“生产工会”，就是为了更好地贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大战略方针。革命是带动生产前进的火车头。工人阶级的群众组织必须在革命统帅生产的前提下，促进生产的发展。中国赫鲁晓夫打着“发展生产”的旗号，实际上一贯破坏社会主义生产。在当前夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大好形势下，一小撮阶级敌人企图用种种卑劣的手段破坏生产，瓦解社会主义经济基础，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。无产阶级革命派务必高度警惕，在向阶级敌人发动主动进攻的同时，在生产上也要打主动的进攻仗，一定要以狠抓革命、猛促生产的实际行动，迎头痛击阶级敌人的进攻，迎接社会主义生产建设的新高潮。
    “福利工会”是腐蚀工人阶级的“糖衣炮弹”
    是政治挂帅还是福利挂帅，这是无产阶级专政条件下两条工运路线斗争的又一个焦点。
    毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”“应当向工会同志和工人群众进行教育，使他们懂得，决不可只看到眼前的片面的福利而忘记了工人阶级的远大利益。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫对抗毛主席的伟大指示，伙同他在工会的一小撮代理人提出了一整套福利挂帅的纲领，大办“福利工会”。他首先大肆鼓吹解放后的工会是“全体工人阶级的经济组织”，“是在解决切身的要求中建立起来的”。他们还叫嚷：在工人阶级取得政权以后，“保护职工群众的物质利益和民主权利”是工会的“独特任务”。
    “关心群众生活”，是伟大领袖毛主席的教导。我们党对于广大职工群众的切身利益问题，群众的生活问题，从来就是十分关心的。但是我们坚决反对资产阶级的福利挂帅。我们首先应该积极引导职工群众关心无产阶级的阶级利益，革命的利益，不倦地提高工人阶级的政治觉悟，为实现共产主义的远大理想而斗争。中国赫鲁晓夫的所谓“关心”，不过是企图用小恩小惠，来诱惑职工忘记巩固无产阶级专政，忘记工人阶级的历史使命，以便于他们进行篡党篡国、复辟资本主义的反革命阴谋活动罢了！
    正是为了这个反革命目的，每当国内外阶级敌人向党向社会主义猖狂进攻的时候，他们就乘机大刮反革命经济主义黑风，阴谋颠覆无产阶级专政。一九五六年匈牙利事件发生不久，中国赫鲁晓夫亲自赤膊上阵，叫嚣什么“在所有制问题解决后，主要注意力应集中在如何分配上”。在一九五七年反右派斗争的前夕，他装出一副“关心”群众利益的面孔，鼓动工会干部要为“群众利益”去“奔走呼号”，不惜“碰得头破血流”，妄图煽动群众反党反社会主义。当我国经济遭到暂时困难时，他们更肆无忌惮地攻击总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，胡说什么一九五八年以来“政治挂帅过了头”，“作思想工作要有物质基础”等等，反对突出无产阶级政治，反对党的社会主义建设总路线，反对社会主义革命。
    十八年来，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在工会的代理人还在大搞“文化福利”的黑旗下，通过文艺、体育、疗养、教育等渠道，向工人群众大量灌输封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的毒素。他们让帝王将相和才子佳人占领工人文化宫的舞台。他们在工人体育运动中大肆鼓吹锦标主义、名利挂帅。他们叫工人疗养院只管“吃好、玩好、休息好”。他们还要工人业余学校“只讲爱克司，不讲马克思”，竭力引导工人走白专道路，如此等等。
    这些事实充分地证明了：十几年里他们所精心设计和顽固坚持的一条所谓“以生产为中心，生产、生活、教育三位一体”的工运方针，正是中国赫鲁晓夫的“生产工会”和“福利工会”的体现，这些统统都是十足的反革命经济主义，都是射向工人阶级的“糖衣炮弹”！
    工人运动的历史经验证明，世界上形形色色的工贼，没有一个不是打着所谓“关心工人福利”的幌子来出卖工人阶级的阶级利益的。中国工人阶级在革命斗争实践中亲身体验到，只有把无产阶级专政的刀把子、印把子牢牢地掌握在自己手里，才是工人阶级利益的最可靠的保障。正如林彪同志所说：“有了政权，无产阶级，劳动人民，就有了一切。没有政权，就丧失一切。”“忘记了政权，就是忘记了政治，忘记了马克思主义的根本观点，变成了经济主义、无政府主义、空想主义。”中国赫鲁晓夫大办“福利工会”，恰恰就是要工人阶级迁就眼前利益，忘记根本利益，丧失自己的政权，使中国重新回到殖民地半殖民地的老路上去。到了那种地步，工人阶级还有什么“福利”可言？
    “全民工会”就是资产阶级工会
    工会是阶级斗争的工具。在工人运动中，虽然有各种派别的工会，但基本上只有两家，不是无产阶级的工会，就是资产阶级的工会。只要阶级还存在，就不可能有超阶级的、全民的工会。无论是在资本主义社会中，还是在社会主义社会中，从来没有代表各个阶级利益的所谓“全民工会”。无产阶级的工会，是在无产阶级政党领导之下，团结广大职工进行阶级斗争的战斗组织。
    中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“全民工会”，是他用来推行资产阶级反动路线的工具，是资产阶级反对无产阶级的工具。他从反动的“阶级斗争熄灭”论出发，叫嚣建立一个不分阶级的、无所不包的“全民工会”。
    毛主席早就教导我们建立“坚强的阶级工会”，“要谨防扒手，防止反动特务分子混入工会。”中国赫鲁晓夫反对毛主席的英明教导。解放初期，他就公开鼓吹工会“不应有政治条件限制”，“只要是工钱劳动者都可以加入”。在他的所谓“工钱劳动者”的幌子下，抹杀阶级界限，抛弃阶级分析，把有严重政治历史问题的国民党“留用人员”，以及资产阶级教授、专家统统拉进工会，给他们披上“工人阶级”的合法外衣。社会主义三大改造基本完成以后，他胡说：“无产阶级与资产阶级的矛盾已经解决了”，“资本家的财产都交了，已经不是资本家了”，极力主张吸收资产阶级分子加入工会，作为一种“政治安排”。
    社会主义教育运动在全国深入开展之后，中国赫鲁晓夫之流又抛出了反动的“阶级同化”论。当时主管全国总工会工作的反革命修正主义分子彭真，竟然在一九六四年省、市、自治区工会主任会议上大放厥词说：工人阶级本身就是不断地把地主、资本家、小官僚、旧警察等等“都同化为工人阶级”。彭真的这一反动谬论，得到了中国赫鲁晓夫的支持。中国赫鲁晓夫妄图把地、富、反、坏、右分子都收罗到他的“全民工会”里，让他们兴风作浪，拒绝改造。在无产阶级文化大革命中，有的家伙公然出来叫嚣说：“我有‘红派司’（会员证），是工人阶级，我不承认是剥削者！”看！中国赫鲁晓夫所要办的“全民工会”，究竟是谁家的工会，不是昭然若揭了吗？！
    列宁说：“政权在哪一个阶级手里，这一点决定一切。”在工会组织中也同样是这样。中国赫鲁晓夫公开地为资产阶级争夺工会的领导权。他叫嚷说：民主党派成员“有被选举到工会领导机关工作的权利”，“都可以而且有权利担负工会的领导工作”。他的娄罗们甚至还以“照顾统战对象”为借口，把一些没有得到改造的资产阶级知识分子塞到工会领导机关，担负领导职务。他们把工人运动的领导权交给了资产阶级知识分子，就是为了篡改工会的阶级性质，使工会成为资产阶级反对无产阶级的工具。
    工团主义就是要把工会变成“独立王国”
    工人阶级的群众组织要不要接受无产阶级政党的领导，这是无产阶级同资产阶级争夺工人运动领导权的严重斗争。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“中国共产党是全中国人民的领导核心。没有这样一个核心，社会主义事业就不能胜利。”无产阶级政党是以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级先锋队，是无产阶级的最高组织形式。无产阶级只有在其先锋队的领导下，才能形成独立的政治力量，登上阶级斗争的历史舞台，以反对资产阶级的剥削和奴役。在夺取政权以后，工人阶级的群众组织只有在党的领导下，才能成为无产阶级专政的社会主义支柱。
    中国赫鲁晓夫为了复辟资本主义，拚命地和党争夺工人运动的领导权。他一贯大搞工团主义，反对党的领导，力图把工会变为由资产阶级司令部控制的反党“独立王国”。
    工团主义是工人运动中的机会主义派别，是工人运动中的一种资产阶级反动思潮。它把工会凌驾于无产阶级政党之上，把它作为工人运动的唯一领导形式。工团主义者否认无产阶级政党的领导，使工人运动局限于经济斗争，反对夺取政权的政治斗争，放弃社会主义革命。十月革命以后，受到托洛茨基、布哈林支持的俄国无政府工团主义者，以“工人反对派”的面目出现，宣扬“工会高于一切”，“工会管理一切”，实际上这是一个反对苏维埃政权的反革命小集团。
    列宁尖锐地指出：“无政府工团主义是机会主义的亲兄弟。”早已被列宁批臭了的工团主义破烂货，却被中国赫鲁晓夫视为“珍宝”。他狂热地鼓吹党对工会“只能协助，不能领导”，再三强调要工会建立独立的“系统领导”。在中国赫鲁晓夫的庇护下，盘踞在全国总工会的一小撮走资派，亦步亦趋地跟着鼓吹“工会独立”论。他们狂妄地叫嚣：工会和党是“并列的”，工会不能接受党的“指派、命令和干涉”，而应该有自己的“系统领导”。中国赫鲁晓夫和他在全国总工会的代理人还大肆鼓吹反动的“本队”论，宣称：党“只包括工人阶级的先进部分”，“并不是工人阶级的‘本队’”，而工会却“几乎包括了工人阶级的全体成员，也可以说它是工人阶级的‘本队’”。因此，“不能说党能领导，工人阶级不能领导”。甚至要求工会“日益增长”地“执行国家机关的职务”，并对政府实行“工会监督”。根据这些反动谬论，他们把自己打扮成“阶级本队”的代表，工人阶级利益的代表，搞反党的“独立王国”。这和
  “工人反对派”的反党纲领何等相似啊！中国赫鲁晓夫如此大肆宣扬这些反动谬论，不仅是反对党的领导，而且要以工会来代替党，妄图实现他们篡党、篡政的反革命罪恶目的。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的这套工团主义谬论，受到批判和抵制以后，一九五八年，他不得不变换反革命手法，又提出要工会当党的“驯服工具”的口号。所谓做党的“驯服工具”，实质是阴谋把工会牢牢控制在中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级司令部的领导之下，充当他们反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的反革命工具。长期以来，全国总工会党内一小撮走资派对毛主席和党中央的指示阳奉阴违，拒不执行；对中国赫鲁晓夫一伙则拜倒在地，步步紧跟。这样的“驯服工具”，还不是一个反对以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的资产阶级“独立王国”吗？
    什么“独立”论、“本队”论、“驯服工具”论，统统都是复辟资本主义的反革命谬论。无论是在资本主义社会中，还是在社会主义社会中，根本没有独立于任何政党之外的工会。它不是接受无产阶级政党的领导，就是接受资产阶级政党的领导，这是不以人们意志为转移的阶级斗争的客观规律。中国赫鲁晓夫竭力贩卖工团主义谬论，否认党是无产阶级的最高组织形式，妄图从根本上否定党对工会的领导，从而把工会纳入他复辟资本主义的“轨道”中去。
    工人阶级群众组织必须坚决服从党的领导，按照工人阶级的根本利益办事，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，决不能允许无政府工团主义的反动思潮毒害我们战斗的工人阶级革命群众组织。
    十八年来，我国工会工作中两条路线的斗争，集中到一点，就是要不要以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为指导，这是决定工人运动方向和道路的最根本的问题。
    列宁说过：“只有革命马克思主义的理论，才能成为工人阶级运动的旗帜”。毛泽东思想是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义，是我们一切工作的指导方针。工人运动脱离了毛泽东思想，就一定迷失方向，工人阶级已经取得的一切革命成果就会付诸东流，毁于一旦。
    工运领域，是无产阶级和资产阶级争夺的重要阵地。正如列宁所说：“既然工人群众自己决不能在他们运动进程中创造出独立的思想体系，那末问题只能是这样：或者是资产阶级的思想体系，或者是社会主义的思想体系。”中国赫鲁晓夫提出和推行“三会一团”修正主义工运路线，正是资产阶级思想体系、正是反革命经济主义在工人运动中的集中表现。中国赫鲁晓夫之流，为了推行反革命修正主义工运路线，集中地反对以毛泽东思想指导工人运动。他们肆无忌惮地诬蔑、攻击毛泽东思想，反对用毛泽东思想指导工人运动，疯狂地反对广大职工活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。他们妄图把社会主义的工人运动蜕变为资产阶级工联主义的自发运动，从而为他们复辟资本主义开辟道路。林彪同志指出：“毛泽东思想并不是劳动人民自发地产生的”，“必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。”十八年来，我国工人运动中两条路线斗争的实践，给我们提供了无产阶级专政下的工人运动的丰富经验，其中根本的根本，就是工人运动必须以毛泽东思想为指导方针。为此，工人阶级的群众组织，必须把组织职工活学活用毛主席著作永远放在一切工作的首位，把毛泽东思想灌输到工人群众中去。只有这样，才能从根本上保证党对工人运动的领导，才能贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能抵制形形色色的资产阶级、小资产阶级思想对工人运动的侵袭，把工人阶级的群众组织办成毛泽东思想的大学校，建设一支朝气蓬勃的、非常革命化、非常战斗化的工人阶级队伍。
