Revolutionary Committees Are Good – Refuting the Soviet Revisionist Traitor Group's Shameless Slander

Ding Xuelei

Revolutionary people across the nation and the world are enthusiastically hailing the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary committees. Revolutionary committees are good! Revolutionary committees are indeed good!

Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "The basic experience of revolutionary committees is threefold: one is the representation of revolutionary cadres, one is the representation of the military, and one is the representation of revolutionary masses, achieving the three-in-one combination. Revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative structures, streamline bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." This is the most profound, scientific, and comprehensive summary by the greatest contemporary revolutionary teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, of the revolutionary committees that have undergone more than a year of revolutionary practice. It is also a very important summary of the historical experience of proletarian dictatorship over more than half a century. It points out the fundamental direction of the construction of proletarian power, indicates the fundamental path for the great revolution of the superstructure in socialist countries to consolidate proletarian dictatorship politically, ideologically, and organizationally, and to prevent capitalist restoration. This is a new development in Marxism-Leninism on the theory of proletarian dictatorship. It is like a beacon, illuminating the path forward for revolutionary committees and pointing out the powerful vitality of this new form of proletarian power.

Revolutionary committees are good! Revolutionary committees are indeed good!

Amidst this chorus of praise, one can faintly hear the buzzing of a few flies hitting the wall, a few wails, and a few sobs. This chorus of wails comes from imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries, with the propaganda machines of the Soviet revisionists shouting the loudest. Listen: "The establishment of revolutionary committees has encountered especially strong resistance," "The so-called 'revolutionary committees' that have been established and are being established are taking on more and more punitive functions," and so on.

If this is merely due to the ignorance of the Soviet revisionist traitor group about revolutionary committees, then the revolutionary masses and people of our country, who are bravely fighting for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, can completely ignore these few flies. However, this group of traitors is still desperately shouting to the Soviet people and the people of the world: "Look, how terrifying this 'revolutionary committee' monster is! It is indeed terrifying!"

Like their predecessors, the old opportunists, the Soviet revisionist traitors deliberately obscure the class nature of the dictatorship machine and exaggerate the so-called "wave of violence" to spread terror. Their purpose is to deceive the Soviet people and the people of the world, attempting to use this to resist the revolutionary influence of this great new thing of the 1960s, the revolutionary committee, in order to maintain their shaky reactionary rule.

Unfortunately, the Soviet revisionist traitor group was born at the wrong time. Now it is the new era of great Mao Zedong Thought. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought have been further grasped by hundreds of millions of people, and people have long understood this truth: "The army, police, courts, and other state machines are tools for one class to oppress another. For the opposing class, it is a tool of oppression, it is violence, and not something 'kind.'" If the old opportunists used this method, they could deceive some people at that time, then today the miserable fate of the Soviet revisionist traitor group is not too pathetic?

"The 'revolutionary committees' are taking on more and more punitive functions." Soviet revisionist traitors, you are right. Absolutely right, the newly born revolutionary committees are indeed to exercise dictatorship over a handful of class enemies, or as you say, "punishment," it is the same, to oppress this handful of class enemies, "allowing them to behave properly, not allowing them to talk or act recklessly. If they talk or act recklessly, they will be immediately suppressed and punished."

For thousands of years, slave owners, feudal landlords, and capitalists have used the state machine to deal with the laboring people in this way. They have oppressed and massacred how many of our class brothers, truly countless! In fact, the Brezhnev and Kosygin old gentlemen who chant the Buddha's name are doing the same. They have betrayed the great Soviet people, pushing the Soviet working class and laboring people, who created the world's first socialist country with their own hands, back into a position of being oppressed and exploited, into the depths of misery. Isn't it precisely you who are "increasingly" carrying out the bourgeois "punishment" of the proletariat?

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary dictatorship and counter-revolutionary dictatorship are opposite in nature, but the former learns from the latter. This learning is very important. If the revolutionary people do not learn this method of ruling over the counter-revolutionary class, they will not be able to maintain power, and their power will be overthrown by internal and external reactionaries, and internal and external reactionaries will restore capitalism in China, and the revolutionary people will suffer."

It is precisely based on Chairman Mao's instruction that the proletariat and revolutionary people of China, since the founding of the People's Republic of China nineteen years ago, have always regarded the power they hold as their lifeline. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, they have never relaxed their attacks on class enemies. This unprecedented scale of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a comprehensive offensive, exposing a handful of traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders within the revolutionary ranks, as well as their backer, the Chinese Khrushchev, stripping them of their power, removing them from office, and establishing a new temporary power organ of the proletarian dictatorship—the revolutionary committees. Why? It is to further adapt to the needs of the socialist economic base, to adapt to the needs of consolidating and strengthening proletarian dictatorship and preventing capitalist restoration, and to adapt to the needs of opposing imperialist aggression. This includes "taking on more and more punitive functions" to suppress a handful of class enemies.

Why can revolutionary committees do this? The most important reason is that they fully embody Chairman Mao's instruction to "trust and rely on the masses, trust and rely on the People's Liberation Army, and trust and rely on the majority of cadres" in their organization. Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "'Three-in-one combination' revolutionary committees are a creation of the working class and the people in this cultural revolution." The creation of the working class and the people of China is a great achievement of proletarian dictatorship and a great achievement of the international communist movement.

The great People's Liberation Army of China is a reliable pillar of proletarian dictatorship and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our People's Liberation Army, with high revolutionary vigilance, defended our great socialist motherland and ensured the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. What is especially important is that they not only made great contributions in "three supports, two militaries" but also directly participated in the "three-in-one combination" revolutionary committees, making our power organs more able to withstand any storm and more able to smash the plots of all enemies at home and abroad, and to exert greater power in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The Soviet revisionist traitor group screams about the "bayonets of soldiers continuing to attack." Their hatred of "soldiers" armed with Mao Zedong Thought and "bayonets" firmly in the hands of the proletariat is not a manifestation of the fear of a handful of class enemies?

Our revolutionary committees are so powerful and effective because they have a flesh-and-blood connection with the masses and are deeply rooted among the masses, with revolutionary mass representatives directly participating in the "three-in-one combination." This self-supervision of power organs from the bottom up is an important measure to consolidate and strengthen proletarian dictatorship and prevent capitalist restoration. Precisely because of this, it deeply hurts the nerves of the bourgeois privileged class riding on the heads of the Soviet people, such as Brezhnev and Kosygin. Their hired "scholars," after some research, finally "discovered" that "the working class in these organizations has no representatives." In the "three-in-one combination" revolutionary mass representatives, there are clearly many excellent worker representatives participating, why don't the Brezhnev and Kosygin old gentlemen see any? The old gentlemen answer: "Because one cannot consider the working class to be composed of the most backward workers and various riffraff in the cities representing the rebels." This means that our working class representatives do not meet the standards of Brezhnev and Kosygin old gentlemen. Who are their "standard workers"? It is not someone else, but their predecessor, the true traitor of the working class, the famous Khrushchev. Thank goodness! If there are such "worker" traitors like Khrushchev in our revolutionary mass representatives, they will definitely be thoroughly cleaned out. Our revolutionary mass representatives are unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, unlimitedly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They are heroes who have been tested and made great contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, representing the direction of the times. The representatives of the working class of China being cursed as "riffraff" by the traitors of the international working class is the highest honor.

In the "three-in-one combination" revolutionary committees, revolutionary leading cadres play a backbone role. The old and new cadres learn from each other and help each other, ensuring the organization of cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Since this issue is so important, the Soviet revisionist traitor group naturally cannot help but slander and attack it. Their propaganda tools scream hoarsely: "In recent days, they suddenly talked about the need to 'correctly handle cadres'." This is the most shameless slander.

The issue of correctly handling cadres is a glorious tradition of our party. As early as 1942, our great leader Chairman Mao personally led the great Rectification Movement of great significance, educating the broad cadres, uniting the whole party, and ensuring the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. Where is the "suddenly talked about"? The following sentence is even more incoherent, showing the derangement of the Soviet revisionist traitors: "It seems they have realized that their position is weak and powerless." Strange, how can "correctly handling cadres" be "realizing that their position is weak and powerless"? On the one hand, we expose a handful of traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and fight them down and expose them; on the other hand, we unite the broad revolutionary cadres and push the revolution forward. This can only be done by the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao. Those who feel their position is "weak and powerless" cannot talk about correctly handling cadres at all. After the Khrushchev revisionist group usurped the leadership of the Soviet party and government, they carried out brutal purges and ruthless attacks on revolutionary leading cadres who dared to uphold Marxist-Leninist principles and oppose revisionism, driving them all out of the leadership positions of the Soviet power, and recruiting all those who are of the same ilk as you, forming a clique of death. Isn't this your "weak and powerless" manifestation? And we, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, trusting and relying on the majority of cadres. Chairman Mao recently taught us again: "We must believe that more than ninety percent of the cadres are good and relatively good. Those who have made mistakes can mostly be corrected." Our great leader and great party have always regarded revolutionary leading cadres as precious assets of the party and the state because they have relatively more experience in struggle and work, can shoulder the heavy responsibility of leading the revolutionary masses to fight against class enemies, and can help and cultivate the growth of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Incorporating revolutionary leading cadres into revolutionary committees is a need for struggle, a need for revolution, and a need to strengthen proletarian dictatorship. And revolutionary leading cadres, after the severe test of the Cultural Revolution and the education and help of the broad masses, have deeply touched their souls, and their worldview has been further transformed. They will definitely make new contributions and build new achievements for the people.

Why does the Soviet revisionist traitor group desperately attack the newly born revolutionary committees on Chinese soil? Because it is precisely the establishment and consolidation of this new red power that declares the complete failure of the plot of Chinese Khrushchev and other top capitalist-roaders within the party to restore capitalism, and declares the complete failure of the plot of imperialism and revisionism to carry out "peaceful evolution" in China. It is natural that Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like should be sad and howl?

Currently, our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is in the midst of the victory song of comprehensive victory, and batch after batch of new revolutionary committees are being established, which is of great historical significance. The establishment of the Paris Commune was the first glorious attempt by the proletariat to establish its own power. The Soviet power established by the October Revolution of the Soviet Union provided valuable experience for the proletariat to seize power. However, after the Khrushchev revisionist group came to power, this power degenerated. Our newly born revolutionary committees are a new form of power produced by continuing the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. It is precisely such a profound and great change that has aroused the malicious attacks and frantic howls of the Soviet revisionist traitor group and all reactionary forces in the world. This is not surprising and is a completely regular phenomenon.

However, history is ruthless. The people's revolution guided by Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of historical progress. All clowns who try to obstruct its progress will be crushed by the wheels of history, and the Soviet revisionist traitors will be no exception.

Workers of the world, unite! Victory will definitely belong to the proletariat! The proletarian revolution will definitely triumph throughout the world! Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!

    革命委员会就是好
    ——驳斥苏修叛徒集团对革命委员会的无耻诽谤
    丁学雷
    全国和全世界革命人民都在热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席关于革命委员会的最新指示的发表。革命委员会好！革命委员会就是好！
    毛主席最近教导我们：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”这是当代最伟大的无产阶级革命导师毛主席对经历了一年多革命实践考验的革命委员会的最精辟、最科学、最全面的总结，也是对半个多世纪以来国际无产阶级专政历史经验的极为重要的总结。它指出了无产阶级政权建设的根本方向，指明了社会主义国家进行上层建筑的大革命，从政治上、思想上和组织上巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的根本途径。这是马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政学说的新发展。它象一盏明灯，照亮了革命委员会前进的道路，指出了这个新生的无产阶级政权形式的强大生命力。
    革命委员会好！革命委员会就是好！
    在这一片欢呼声中，人们也隐约地听到几个碰壁的苍蝇嗡嗡叫，几声凄厉，几声抽泣。这阵阵凄厉的抽泣是从帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派那里发出来的，而苏修的御用宣传机器则叫嚷得特别厉害。你听：建立革命委员会“遇到了特别强烈的反抗”，“已经建立和正在建立的所谓‘革命委员会’担负着越来越多的惩治职能”等等，等等。
    如果说，这仅仅是由于苏修叛徒集团对革命委员会的无知，那么，正在为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利而英勇奋战的我国无产阶级革命派和革命人民，完全可以不去理睬这几个苍蝇。可是苏修这一伙叛徒却还要拚命地向苏联人民和世界人民哇哇乱叫：你们看，“革命委员会”这个怪物多么可怕！真是可怕！
    苏修叛徒们同他们的前辈老机会主义者一样，故意抹煞专政机器的阶级属性，大肆渲染所谓“暴力浪潮”的恐怖，目的就是想欺骗苏联人民和世界人民，企图以此来抵制革命委员会这个六十年代伟大的新生事物的革命影响，以保住他们摇摇欲坠的反动统治。
    可惜，苏修叛徒集团“生不逢辰”。现在已是伟大的毛泽东思想的新时代，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想已经进一步为亿万人民群众所掌握，人们早已懂得了这样一个真理：“军队、警察、法庭等项国家机器，是阶级压迫阶级的工具。对于敌对的阶级，它是压迫的工具，它是暴力，并不是什么‘仁慈’的东西。”如果说，老机会主义者运用这个手法，当时多少还能欺骗一些人的话，那么，今天苏修叛徒集团冷落的下场岂非太可悲了吗？
    “‘革命委员会’担负着越来越多的惩治职能”。苏修叛徒们，你们说对了。一点不错，新生的革命委员会，就是要对一小撮阶级敌人实行专政，或者按照你们的说法叫“惩治”，总之是一样，要压迫这一小撮阶级敌人，“只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。如要乱说乱动，立即取缔，予以制裁。”
    几千年来，奴隶主、封建地主、资产阶级，他们掌握了国家机器就是这么对付劳动人民的，他们压迫和残杀了我们多少阶级兄弟，真是千千万万，万万千千啊！其实，口念弥陀的勃列日涅夫和柯西金大老爷，你们自己也是这么干的。你们背叛了伟大的苏联人民，把亲手创建了世界上第一个社会主义国家的苏联工人阶级和劳动人民，又重新推到被压迫、被剥削的地位，投入水深火热之中。难道不正是你们
  “越来越多”地执行资产阶级对无产阶级的“惩治”吗？
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“革命的专政和反革命的专政，性质是相反的，而前者是从后者学来的。这个学习很要紧。革命的人民如果不学会这一项对待反革命阶级的统治方法，他们就不能维持政权，他们的政权就会被内外反动派所推翻，内外反动派就会在中国复辟，革命的人民就会遭殃。”
    正是根据毛主席的这一教导，中国无产阶级和革命人民，从中华人民共和国成立十九年来，一直把自己掌握的政权看作是命根子，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，从不放松对于阶级敌人的进攻。而这次空前规模的无产阶级文化大革命，更是一次总进攻，把混进革命队伍内部的一小撮叛徒、特务、反革命分子和死不悔改的走资派，以及他们的总后台中国赫鲁晓夫统统揪出来，夺他们的权，罢他们的官，建立起无产阶级政权的崭新的临时权力机构——革命委员会。为的什么？就是为的进一步适应社会主义经济基础的需要，适应巩固和加强无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的需要，适应反对帝国主义侵略的需要，其中就包括“担负着越来越多的惩治职能”，镇压一小撮阶级敌人。
    革命委员会为什么能够做到这样？最重要的就是因为它把毛主席的指示“要相信和依靠群众，相信和依靠人民解放军，相信和依靠干部的大多数”，在组织上充分地体现了出来。我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“‘三结合’的革命委员会，是工人阶级和人民群众在这次文化大革命中的一种创造。”中国工人阶级和人民群众的这个创造，是无产阶级专政的伟大创举，是国际共产主义运动的伟大创举。
    伟大的中国人民解放军，是无产阶级专政和无产阶级文化大革命的可靠支柱。我们的人民解放军在无产阶级文化大革命期间，以高度的革命警惕，保卫了我们伟大的社会主义祖国，保卫了无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。特别重要的是，他们不仅在“三支”“两军”中作出了伟大的贡献，而且直接参加了“三结合”的革命委员会，这样就使得我们的政权机构，更能够经受任何惊涛骇浪的考验，更能够粉碎国内外一切敌人的阴谋，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，发挥更加强大的威力。苏修叛徒集团大骂什么“士兵的刺刀继续进行讨伐”。他们这样痛恨用毛泽东思想武装起来的“士兵”和紧紧地掌握在无产阶级手中的“刺刀”，不就表现了一小撮阶级敌人的恐惧心理吗？
    我们的革命委员会之所以如此强大有力，还因为它是与群众有着血肉的联系、深深扎根于群众之中的，是有革命群众的代表直接参加“三结合”的。这种对各级政权机构实行自下而上的革命监督，是巩固和加强无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的重要措施。正因为这样，又深深触痛了骑在苏联人民头上的勃列日涅夫、柯西金等一小撮资产阶级特权阶层的神经，他们的御用“学者”经过一番考证，终于“发现”“中国工人阶级在这些组织中没有代表”。在“三结合”的革命群众代表中，明明有大量优秀的工人代表参加，为什么勃列日涅夫和柯西金大老爷一概看不到呢？大老爷回答说：“因为不能认为工人阶级是由最落后的工人和城市的各种败类组成的造反派的代表。”这就是说，我们的工人阶级的代表是不符合勃列日涅夫、柯西金大老爷的标准的。他们的“标准工人”是谁呢？不是别人，就是他们的前任、真正的工人阶级的败类、大名鼎鼎的赫鲁晓夫。此人不是到世界各地宣扬过自己是个“矿工”吗？谢天谢地！我们的革命群众代表中，如果有象赫鲁晓夫这样的“工人”败类，那是一定要彻底清除出去的。我们的革命群众代表是无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的革命派，是在无产阶级文化大革命中经受了考验并且做出了巨大贡献的闯将，是代表了时代前进方向的顶天立地的工人阶级。中国工人阶级的代表被国际工人阶级的败类咒骂为“败类”，这是无上的光荣。
    在“三结合”的革命委员会中，革命的领导干部起着骨干的作用，新老干部互相学习，互相帮助，就使培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的工作在组织上有了保证。问题既然这么重要，苏修叛徒集团当然不能不加以诬蔑和攻击。他们的宣传工具声嘶力竭地叫嚷：“最近几天，那里突然谈到必须‘正确对待干部’”。这真是最无耻的诽谤。
    正确对待干部的问题，是我们党的光荣传统。早在一九四二年，我们的伟大领袖毛主席就亲自领导了具有伟大意义的整风运动，教育了广大干部，团结了全党，保证了抗日战争和解放战争的胜利。哪里是什么“突然谈到”呢？下面这句话更是语无伦次，表现了苏修叛徒们的神经错乱：“看来他们已意识到自己的地位是软弱无力的。”奇怪，“正确对待干部”怎么会是“意识到自己的地位软弱无力”呢？我们一方面把一小撮叛徒、特务、反革命分子和死不悔改的走资派统统揪出来，把他们斗倒批臭；另一方面把广大革命干部团结起来，把革命推向前进。这只有在伟大领袖毛主席领导下的伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党才能这样做。一切感到自己地位“软弱无力”的人，根本谈不上什么正确地对待干部。赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡夺了苏联党政领导大权之后，对敢于坚持马克思列宁主义原则、反对修正主义的革命领导干部，进行残酷清洗，无情打击，把他们统统排挤出苏维埃政权的领导岗位，而把与你们臭味相投的工人阶级的叛徒统统网罗进来，结成死党，这不正是你们“软弱无力”的表现吗？而我们，在无产阶级文化大革命中，坚定地执行毛主席的干部政策，相信和依靠干部的大多数。毛主席最近又一次教导我们：“要相信百分之九十以上的干部是好的和比较好的。犯了错误的人，大多数是可以改的。”我们伟大的领袖和伟大的党，从来就是把革命领导干部当作党和国家的宝贵财富，因为他们比较地有斗争经验和工作经验，能够挑起领导革命群众向阶级敌人进行战斗的重担，能够帮助和培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的成长。把革命领导干部结合进革命委员会，是斗争的需要，是革命的需要，是加强无产阶级专政的需要。而革命领导干部，经过文化大革命的严峻考验和广大群众的教育、帮助，深刻地触及了自己的灵魂，世界观得到了进一步改造，他们一定会为人民立新功，建新劳。
    苏修叛徒集团为什么要这样拚命地攻击中国土地上新生的革命委员会？这是因为，正是革命委员会这个新生红色政权的建立和巩固，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派复辟资本主义的阴谋彻底破产，宣告了帝国主义、修正主义企图在中国搞“和平演变”的阴谋彻底破产。兔死狐悲，物伤其类，怎么不叫勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流悲伤、嚎叫呢？
    目前，我国无产阶级文化大革命在夺取全面胜利的凯歌声中，一批又一批地建立了新生的革命委员会，这是具有重大历史意义的。巴黎公社的建立，是无产阶级第一次建立自己政权的光荣尝试。苏联十月革命建立的苏维埃政权，提供了宝贵的无产阶级夺取政权的经验。但在赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团上台后，这个政权变质了。我国新生的革命委员会，是在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命所产生的新的政权形式。正是这样一场深刻的伟大的变革，激起了苏修叛徒集团和世界上一切反动势力的恶毒的攻击和疯狂的叫嚣。这是并不奇怪的，是完全合乎规律的现象。
    但是，历史是无情的。毛泽东思想指引下的人民革命是历史前进的火车头。一切企图阻挡它前进的小丑，都将被历史的巨轮碾得粉碎，苏修叛徒们也绝不会例外。
    全世界无产者，联合起来！胜利一定属于无产阶级！无产阶级革命一定要在全世界胜利！战无不胜的马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！
