Chairman Mao teaches us: "The situation is constantly changing, to make one's thoughts adapt to the new situation, one must study. Even for those who have a relatively good understanding of Marxism and have a firm proletarian stance, one must still study, accept new things, and research new problems." Vice Chairman Lin also instructs us: "We must regard ourselves as a force for the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. The revolution also requires us to revolutionize ourselves. Without revolutionizing ourselves, the revolution cannot be successful." Chairman Mao's teachings and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions are particularly important to me. As the socialist revolution deepens, I am a cadre in a leadership position, a person who holds power for the masses. If I do not strive to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform my worldview and revolutionize myself, I will fall behind Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and will not be able to faithfully execute Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Not only will I fall behind and take the wrong path, but I will also cause damage to the Party's cause. Whether or not I can continue to revolutionize myself for a lifetime is a major issue related to whether I can be unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao for a lifetime and follow Chairman Mao's revolution to the end.

	To Have a High Degree of Self-Awareness in Revolutionizing Oneself

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In our country, the struggle between socialism and capitalism in the ideological realm, as to who will win, will take a fairly long time to resolve." I have studied Chairman Mao's great teachings many times, but my understanding has been very poor. I saw that the struggle between the two ideologies, as to who will win, has not yet been fully resolved, and that there is still the possibility of capitalist restoration in a proletarian dictatorship state. However, I did not realize that the struggle between the two ideologies in my own mind has not been fully resolved, and that there is still the possibility of "changing" (i.e., from a proletarian leader to a leader who takes the capitalist road).

The Cultural Revolution sounded the alarm, exposing the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. At the same time, it also touched my soul. First, it was from my attitude towards the revolutionary young people that I saw my own problems.

When the Cultural Revolution began, I was working in the Military Affairs Department of Hunchun County. At that time, a revolutionary mass organization in the county made a big fuss about a small clique of capitalist roaders within the old county committee. Their actions were very good. However, at that time, I did not understand and took a reserved attitude towards their actions.

The revolutionary masses of the proletariat are fearless. They dare to rebel against the capitalist roaders and dare to criticize our shortcomings and mistakes. One day, they came to me and severely criticized me, which surprised me greatly, and my thoughts underwent a fierce struggle.

I repeatedly asked myself: Why did I not understand the revolutionary actions of the young people? Why did I have reservations about their revolutionary actions? During the democratic revolution, I had no such thoughts. At that time, fighting Chiang Kai-shek was the better the harder the fight, and there was never any doubt. The democratic revolution is a revolution, and the socialist revolution is also a revolution. Why are they both revolutions, one is the harder the better, and the other is a bit soft-hearted? Thinking and thinking, there was no other reason, just that I hated Chiang Kai-shek to the core at that time, but today I did not hate the small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party to the core. So, Chiang Kai-shek and the small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party are both enemies, why do I hate one to the core, but not the other? It was then that I discovered that my thoughts and feelings had a problem.

With this question in mind, I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is a counter-revolutionary." Comparing my thoughts, I was indeed shocked. I asked myself: On whose side do I stand? Although I did not stand on the side of the capitalist roaders, I also did not stand 100% on the side of the revolutionary young people, and I still had some reservations and did not understand their actions. Does this not show that my attitude and feelings are changing? I felt that the problem was indeed very serious, and I could not help but consider such a serious question: During the democratic revolution, I was a revolutionary; in the socialist period, under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, can I still be a revolutionary? History does not stop moving forward, the locomotive of history has already pulled our bodies into socialism, but my thoughts have not kept up with the times.

Why did my attitude and feelings change? Through repeated root-causing and finding the reasons, I realized that this was the reflection of class struggle in my mind. The reason for the "change": One is that my position gradually rose, and my sense of the masses gradually faded, and I became distant from the masses. In this way, I could not understand the socialist revolutionary demands of the masses. During the democratic revolution, from my position to my thoughts, I was an ordinary soldier, thinking what the masses thought, doing what the masses did. Now it is different, I am distant from the masses, and my attitude and feelings will change. The second is that I have subjectivity and lack self-awareness. I think I have a good background and have not made any mistakes. Although I also think I need to strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and transform my worldview, I also think that this is a matter of making myself "better and better." In this way, I actually affirmed that the struggle between the two ideologies in my mind has been completely resolved. Therefore, the effort to transform my thoughts was lacking, and I could not keep up with Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao teaches us that the Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches people's souls and is to solve the problem of people's worldview. Correctly understanding myself, the momentum to transform myself in the Cultural Revolution was sufficient, and I felt a sense of urgency to transform my thoughts that I had never felt before, and I had a spirit of fighting against selfishness. At that time, it was when the masses were holding a meeting to criticize the old county committee. I strove to attend more of the mass meetings, standing among the masses, treating the battlefield of criticizing the revisionists as the battlefield of fighting against selfishness, consciously putting myself in it, pulling my "selfishness" onto the stage to fight, and consciously launching a fierce attack on my soul. The masses criticized some leaders of the old county committee for only focusing on administrative work and not on class struggle. I consciously compared myself: In my work, am I not also guilty of focusing too much on trivial matters and too little on the fundamentals? Once, at a criticism meeting, the masses criticized a county committee secretary, saying: The county standing committee has not seriously studied Chairman Mao's works for several years and has not held a single meeting to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. The question raised by the masses was very sharp. I thought, I have participated in the county standing committee for six years, can the masses not raise such a question to me? I knew the situation of the old county committee, why did I not raise such a sharp question like the revolutionary masses? After returning, I analyzed the questions raised by the revolutionary masses about the county committee and my past attitudes towards these questions, roughly in three situations: One is that I agreed with and supported them; one is that I resisted them but not firmly; and another is that I firmly fought against them. Every criticism meeting, I actively participated and listened carefully to the masses' criticisms. The revolutionary masses had not yet criticized deeply, and I would criticize more after returning. Once, after the meeting had already ended late, I was still struggling with the public-private struggle in my mind, so I lay in bed reciting "Old Three Articles," comparing Zhang Zedong, Bai Qiu'en, and Old Fool, and then looking at the revolutionary masses. The more I thought, the more I felt that I was falling behind the revolutionary masses. They loved Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and the socialist system so much, and hated the capitalist roaders so much. The demands of the socialist revolution were so high. The more I thought, the more urgent I felt the need to revolutionize myself, and the more I felt that I should use the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day" to transform my thoughts, catch up with the revolutionary masses, and catch up with the new situation of the deepening socialist revolution.

Chairman Mao said: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." Through continuous self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, I realized: A person's worldview must be constantly and continuously transformed by Mao Zedong Thought and cannot stop. The class struggle in society is constantly reflected in a person's mind. Always remembering that the struggle between "who will win" in one's mind has not been completely resolved, one will always have the self-awareness to revolutionize oneself. Being the object of the revolution is an objective existence, and it is not because one does not want to be the object of the revolution that one is not the object of the revolution. The question is how to consciously regard oneself as the object of the revolution and consciously revolutionize oneself.

	To Revolutionize Oneself, One Must Thoroughly Uproot "Selfishness"

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism." I understand that the word "fight" and the word "criticize" are both very heavy. Only by fighting hard can we make "selfishness" stink; only by criticizing fiercely can we prevent and eliminate revisionism. That is to say, we must take the initiative to attack and attack fiercely.

Last year, we had just entered the Cultural Revolution when we mishandled an issue, and the masses wrote letters criticizing us, saying: "We should hold a meeting to criticize ourselves." I thought: "It is not honorable to criticize oneself in a meeting, just issue a notice." When my opinion was put forward, some comrades criticized me: "'Fear' is at the forefront, selfish thoughts." This criticism shocked me greatly. Chairman Mao teaches us: "A thorough materialist is fearless." Why am I afraid? Thinking and thinking, it is still because I do not hate "selfishness" deeply enough. So, I repeatedly dug into my thoughts. I realized: For me, it is still the "official" mentality. With the "official" mentality, I do not understand the thoughts and actions of the masses, nor do I investigate and study, but subjectively satisfy myself with my own analysis. Is this not the mentality of an "official"? In Hunchun, I am a decision-maker, and the "official" and "selfishness" are combined, which is terrible. Thinking this way, I felt that "selfishness" is our great enemy, and I had the desire to make it stink. So, I agreed to hold a public meeting to criticize myself.

Before the meeting, we first held a symposium with some masses participating, repeatedly criticizing ourselves, exposing and fighting against our selfishness. The result was beyond my expectation, the masses were very moved and applauded for us. They were very grateful to Chairman Mao and the People's Liberation Army, and they recited Chairman Mao's quotations on the spot: "Without a people's army, there would be nothing for the people."

This incident deeply educated me and made my understanding of exposing and fighting against selfishness take a leap. I thought, we have made mistakes and should criticize ourselves, why do the masses still applaud for us? Thinking and thinking, I came to a conclusion, the masses applauded for us, not for our mistakes, but for our revolutionary spirit of daring to fight against our mistakes. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Any party, any individual, mistakes are inevitable, we require fewer mistakes. Once mistakes are made, we require them to be corrected, the quicker and more thorough the correction, the better." We went to the masses to expose and fight against our selfishness, which was to carry out and defend Chairman Mao's great instruction, which was to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. What is there to be ashamed of or bad about? So, we gathered courage and held a meeting of more than 5,000 people to conduct a public self-criticism, expose and fight against our selfishness, and the result was that more masses were educated, turning this meeting into a meeting to fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, and a meeting to support the army and love the people.

Fighting against selfishness requires a spirit of ruthlessness, once "selfishness" is discovered, it must be actively attacked and continuously attacked; it must be thoroughly broken, and the masses must be mobilized to break it. That is to say, revolutionizing oneself must have initiative and thoroughness. Only by exposing "selfishness" to the masses and throwing "selfishness" into the "people's war" of fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism can the fight against selfishness be more effective. Daring or not daring to mobilize the masses to help oneself fight against selfishness is an important sign of whether one hates selfishness deeply and dares to break it thoroughly.

Last July, a large character suddenly appeared on the streets of Hunchun: "Bombard Cui Hailong!" It was written by some comrades from a revolutionary mass organization that we supported. This incident caused a sensation in the county. Is this a good thing or a bad thing for me? I think it is a good thing. In the past, I had shortcomings and mistakes, and I visited everywhere to ask people to help me fight against selfishness. Now someone is voluntarily bombarding me, is this not a good thing for me? I regarded these few words as a notice from the masses for me to go to them, and as a signal to urge me to better carry out Chairman Mao's instructions. So, I quickly went to the comrades of that mass organization and listened to their criticisms of me. In this way, our feelings were harmonious, and we united and fought together on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The Highest Standard for Revolutionizing Oneself is Unlimited Loyalty to Chairman Mao

The practice of fighting against selfishness, the practice of revolutionizing oneself, has raised a very serious question for me. Linking up with the past practice of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and transforming my thoughts, sometimes I considered personal progress, sometimes it was to do a certain job well, and sometimes I considered whether I made mistakes or not. I felt that these were all low standards. Then, what is the highest standard for fighting against selfishness? I brought this question to study Vice Chairman Lin's instructions. Vice Chairman Lin said: "What attitude to take towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very important question. We must focus on the issue of attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought." Vice Chairman Lin's instructions made me clearly realize: The highest standard for revolutionizing oneself should be unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This is to fight against selfishness for the sake of unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao. Without Chairman Mao's wise leadership and the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no our Party, our army, our country, and there would be nothing for the proletariat and the working people. The attitude towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the biggest and biggest politics. Therefore, a revolutionary fighter, especially an old fighter who has taken up leadership work, must consciously use this highest standard to demand oneself, thoroughly break down all kinds of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois selfish thoughts that hinder our unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, and thoroughly establish the proletarian thought of selflessness.

After realizing this problem, I made up my mind to take this highest standard as the goal, heart towards this goal, eyes on this goal, and forever move towards this goal. I want to achieve: A lifetime of consciously revolutionizing oneself, a lifetime of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao.

    一辈子忠于毛主席，一辈子自觉地进行自我革命
    沈阳部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子　崔海龙
    毛主席教导我们：“情况是在不断地变化，要使自己的思想适应新的情况，就得学习。即使是对于马克思主义已经了解得比较多的人，无产阶级立场比较坚定的人，也还是要再学习，要接受新事物，要研究新问题。”林副主席也指示我们：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”毛主席的教导和林副主席的指示对我特别重要。社会主义革命越来越深入，自己又是一个担负领导职务的干部，是一个为群众掌权的人，如果不努力用毛泽东思想改造世界观，不革自己的命，就会跟不上毛主席的伟大战略部署，就不能忠实执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。不仅自己要掉队、走邪路，而且还会给党的事业造成损失。能不能一辈子坚持革自己的命，是关系到能不能一辈子无限忠于毛主席，紧跟毛主席革命到底的大问题。
      要有革自己的命的高度自觉性
    毛主席教导我们说：“我国社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决。”毛主席这个伟大教导，我学习过许多次，可是，理解得很差。我看到了两种意识形态谁胜谁负的斗争还没有最后解决，无产阶级专政的国家，还有资本主义复辟的可能性，但是，却没有想到自己头脑里两种意识形态谁胜谁负的斗争也没有完全解决，还存在着“变”（即由无产阶级的当权派，变成走资本主义道路的当权派）的可能性。
    无产阶级文化大革命一声炮响，揭开了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的盖子，同时也触及了我的灵魂。首先是从对待革命小将的态度上，看到了自己的问题。
    无产阶级文化大革命开始的时候，我在珲春县武装部工作。那时县里一个革命群众组织，大造了旧县委内一小撮走资派的反。他们的行动好得很。可是当时我很不理解，对他们的行动采取了保留态度。
    无产阶级革命派是天不怕地不怕的，他们敢于造走资派的反，也敢于批评我们的缺点错误。一天，他们找到我，严厉批评了我，使我大吃一惊，思想上展开了激烈的斗争。
    我反复问自己：为什么自己对小将的革命行动不理解呢？为什么对他们的革命行动有保留呢？在民主革命时期，我是没有这个想法的。那时打蒋介石，打得越狠越好，从来没有什么怀疑的。民主革命是革命，社会主义革命也是革命，为什么都是革命，一个打得越狠越好，一个就有些心慈手软了呢？想来想去，没有别的原因，就是自己那时对蒋介石恨之入骨，而今天对党内一小撮走资派，就不象对蒋介石那样恨之入骨。那么，蒋介石和党内一小撮走资派都是敌人，为什么对一个恨之入骨，而对另一个就不那么恨呢？这时我才发现，原来自己的思想感情有问题。
    我带着这个问题，反复学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”对照自己的思想，确实感到吃惊。我问自己：我是站在那一方面的呢？虽然我没有站在走资派方面，可是，我也没有百分之百地站在革命小将一边，对他们还有些保留，不理解他们的做法。这不就说明我的态度、感情在变吗？我感到问题确实很严重，自己不能不考虑这样一个严肃的问题：在民主革命时期，自己是一个革命者；到了社会主义时期，在无产阶级专政条件下，自己还能不能继续做一个革命者。历史不停息地向前飞奔，历史的火车头已经把我们的身体拉进了社会主义，而我的思想，却没有紧紧随着时代前进。
    为什么态度感情有些变化呢？通过反复挖根子找原因，自己认识到，这是阶级斗争在自己头脑中的反映。“变”的原因：一个是职位逐步提高，自己的群众观念逐渐淡薄起来，离群众远了。这样就不能理解群众的社会主义革命要求。在民主革命时期，自己从职务到思想都是普通一兵，群众想啥我想啥，群众干啥我干啥。现在就不同了，离群众远了，态度感情就会变。二是自己存在着盲目性，缺乏自觉性。觉得自己出身好，没犯过错误，虽然也认为自己需要努力活学活用毛主席著作，改造世界观，但是，又觉得那是使自己“好上加好”的问题。这样，也就在实际上肯定了自己头脑中两种意识形态谁胜谁负的斗争已经完全解决了。因此，改造思想的狠劲就差了，跟毛主席的无产阶级革命路线也就跟不紧了。
    毛主席教导我们，无产阶级文化大革命是触及人们灵魂的大革命，是要解决人们的世界观问题。正确认识了自己，在无产阶级文化大革命中改造自己的劲头就足了，就会感到一种从来没有感到过的改造思想的迫切性，就有了一种斗私的狠劲。那时正是群众开大会批判旧县委的时候，我力争多去参加群众的大会，站在群众之中，把批修的战场，同时当做斗私的战场，自觉地把自己摆进去，把自己的“私”字拉到台上去斗，自觉地向自己灵魂深处发起猛烈进攻。群众批判旧县委的一些领导人，过去只抓事务工作，不抓阶级斗争。自己就自觉地对照自己：我在工作上不是也有抓小节多，抓根本少的缺点错误吗？一次，群众在批判大会上批评一个县委书记说：县常委几年来从没有认真学习过毛主席著作，没开过一次活学活用毛主席著作讲用会。群众提的问题十分尖锐。我想，自己参加县常委会已经六年了，群众不是也可以向自己提出这样的问题吗？旧县委的一些情况，自己是了解的，为什么却没有象革命群众这样尖锐地提出问题呢？回来后，我就把革命群众提出的县委的问题和自己过去对这些问题所持的态度做了分析，大致有三种情况：一种是自己同意并支持了的；一种是自己抵制了，但不坚决的；再一种就是坚决作了斗争的。每次批判大会，自己都积极参加，认真听取群众的批判。革命群众还没有批判深透的，自己回来再批。有一次，散会已经很晚了，自己思想上的公私斗争还没有解决，就躺在床上背“老三篇”，对比张思德、白求恩、老愚公，再看看革命群众，越想，越感到自己落后于革命群众。他们是那样热爱毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想，热爱社会主义制度，是那样痛恨走资派，社会主义革命的要求是那样高。越想，自己革自己命的要求越迫切，越觉得自己应该用“只争朝夕”的革命精神改造思想，赶上革命群众，赶上深入发展的社会主义革命的新形势。
    毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变。”通过不断斗私批修，我体会到：一个人的世界观必须经常不断地用毛泽东思想来改造，不能停息。社会阶级斗争不断地反映到人的头脑里来。时刻牢记自己头脑里“谁胜谁负”的斗争还没有完全解决，就时刻具有革自己命的自觉性。当革命对象，这是个客观存在，并不因为自己不愿当革命对象，自己就不是革命对象。问题是怎样自觉地把自己当作革命对象，自觉地革自己的命。
      革自己的命，要狠挖“私”字
    毛主席教导我们：“要斗私，批修”。我体会一个“斗”字，一个“批”字，这两个字有千斤重。狠“斗”，才能把“私”字搞臭；猛“批”，才能防修灭修。这就是说，要主动进攻，猛烈进攻。
    去年，我们刚介入无产阶级文化大革命不久，对一个问题处理不妥当，群众写信批评我们，有的说：“要开大会检讨。”我想：“开大会检讨不光彩，发个通告算了。”我的意见一提出，有的同志就批评我：“‘怕’字当头，私心杂念。”这个批评使我受到很大震动。毛主席教导我们：“彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的”。我为什么就畏惧了呢？想来想去，还是对“私”字恨得不深。于是，我反复挖了思想根子。我认识到：对自己说来，还是“官”气作怪。有了“官”气，就不理解群众的思想和群众的行动，也不去调查研究，主观主义地满足于自己的分析，这不就是“官老爷”的思想作风吗？我在珲春是一个参加决定问题的人，“官”字和“私”字结合了，就不得了。这样一想，就觉得“私”字是我们的大敌，就有了把它搞臭的愿望。于是，我表示同意开大会公开检讨。
    在召开大会之前，我们首先召开了一个有部分群众参加的座谈会，向他们反复作检讨，亮私斗私。结果，出乎我的意料之外，群众很受感动，给我们鼓掌。他们非常感谢毛主席，感谢解放军，当场背诵了毛主席语录：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”
    这件事深深地教育了我，使我对亮私、斗私的认识，产生了一个飞跃。我想，我们有错误，应该检讨，为什么群众还给我们鼓掌呢？想来想去，得出一个结论，群众为我们鼓掌，不是为我们的错误鼓掌，而是为我们敢于和自己的错误做斗争的革命精神鼓掌。毛主席教导我们：“任何政党，任何个人，错误总是难免的，我们要求犯得少一点。犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”我们到群众中去亮私斗私，就是去贯彻执行毛主席这个伟大指示，就是去捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，这有什么丢人，有什么不好呢？于是，我们鼓起勇气，召开了五千多人的大会，进行公开检查，亮私斗私，结果，使更多的群众受到了教育，把这个大会开成了斗私批修的大会，开成了拥军爱民的大会。
    斗私要有一种狠劲，一发现“私”字，就要主动进攻，不断进攻；要彻底破掉，要发动群众来破。这就是说，革自己的命要有主动性、彻底性。只有把“私”字亮给群众，把“私”字丢进斗私批修的“人民战争”的汪洋大海，斗私才能更有成效。敢不敢发动群众帮助自己斗私，是对私恨得深不深，敢不敢彻底破的重要标志。
    去年七月，珲春街上突然出现了一行大字：炮轰崔海龙！还是我们支持的一个革命群众组织的一些同志写的。这一下轰动了县城。这件事对我来说是好事还是坏事？我觉得是好事。以前，我有缺点错误，到处走访，请人帮助斗私，现在有人主动炮轰我了，这对我来说，还不是好事吗？我把这几个字看成是群众要我到他们中间去的通知，是督促我更好地贯彻毛主席指示的信号。于是，我很快地到那个群众组织的同志中间，听取他们对我的批评。这样，我们的感情融洽了，共同团结战斗在毛主席的革命路线上。
  革自己的命的最高标准是无限忠于毛主席
    斗私的实践，革自己命的实践，给自己提出了一个非常严肃的问题。联系过去活学活用毛主席著作，改造思想的一些情况，有时考虑的是个人的进步，有时是为了把某项工作做好，有时考虑的又是犯不犯错误。我觉得这些都是低标准。那么，斗私的最高标准是什么呢？我带着这个问题，学习了林副主席的指示。林副主席说：“对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是一个很重要的问题。我们就是要抓对毛主席的态度、对毛泽东思想的态度问题。”林副主席的指示使自己明确认识到：革自己命的最高标准，应该是无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。这就是要为了无限忠于毛主席而斗私。没有毛主席的英明领导，没有毛泽东思想的光辉照耀，就没有我们的党，我们的军队，我们的国家，就没有无产阶级和劳动人民的一切。对毛主席、毛泽东思想、毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的态度，是最大最大的政治。因此，一个革命战士，特别是已经担任领导工作的老战士，必须自觉地以这个最高标准来要求自己，大破妨碍我们无限忠于毛主席的各种资产阶级、小资产阶级的私心杂念，大立一心为公的无产阶级思想。
    认识到这个问题之后，我便下定决心，把这个最高标准当做目标，心向着这个目标，眼盯着这个目标，永远朝着这个目标前进。我要做到：一辈子自觉革自己的命，一辈子忠于伟大领袖毛主席。
