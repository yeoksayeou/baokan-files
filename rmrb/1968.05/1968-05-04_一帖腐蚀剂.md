A Corrosive Agent

Beijing Garrison Unit, Wei Qingjun, Luo Jisheng

The reactionary film "Red River Waves" and the remnants of the Gao Gang anti-party clique once openly shouted that "Red River Waves" could be made into a movie to propagate nationwide, to conduct revolutionary tradition education, "is education for the six hundred million people," "is education for the youth and future generations," "we must let our descendants see how their predecessors fought to establish the country."

This is genuinely using the red flag to oppose the red flag. This is sheer counterrevolutionary jargon.

To conduct revolutionary tradition education for the young generation is a revolutionary slogan of the proletariat, a great strategic measure to cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Its purpose is to make the young generation, who grow up in happiness, understand what class oppression is, what class exploitation is, understand how the Chinese proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, fought bravely and selflessly, overthrew the three big mountains oppressing the Chinese people, and achieved great victories. Thus, the young generation can inherit and carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of the proletariat, and march forward bravely along the victorious course opened by Chairman Mao. However, the remnants of the Gao Gang anti-party clique took over this revolutionary slogan of the proletariat, removed the revolutionary content of the proletariat, and stuffed in counterrevolutionary black goods.

In 1958, the authorities in the Northwest region and the original Gansu Provincial Party Committee who took the capitalist road, along with the remnants of the Gao Gang anti-party clique, under the pretext of "commemorating revolutionary martyrs" and "conducting communist education for the youth and future generations," stirred up a wave of rehabilitating the Gao Gang anti-party clique. In September of the same year, a black henchman of the Peng-Gao anti-party clique visited Lanzhou three times, gave instructions, and plotted to rehabilitate Gao Gang. The production of the reactionary film "Red River Waves" was officially launched under the command of this black henchman.

The producers of "Red River Waves" went to great lengths to play tricks, dressing up Gao Gang as a "hero," "party leader," "savior of the people," and "hope of the poor." They distorted history, confused right and wrong, and vigorously propagated the reactionary fallacy of "Shanbei saving the Central Committee." Throughout the film, they did not depict Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership, nor did they sing the praises of the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Their reactionary essence of shouting "to propagate nationwide" and "to conduct revolutionary tradition education" is evident.

"Fake is fake, and disguise should be stripped off." The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Gansu, along with the remnants of the Gao Gang anti-party clique, did not propagate Chairman Mao's heroic deeds in leading the people of Shaan-Gan-Ning to establish a revolutionary base area and smash Chiang Kai-shek's third "encirclement and suppression." Instead, they distorted history, reversed right and wrong, and advocated Gao Gang's banditry, praising Gao Gang's merits, and erecting monuments for him. They did not propagate Chairman Mao's leadership in guiding the Red Army to struggle hard, fight against class enemies, and struggle against the Wang Ming line and Gao Gang's banditry. Instead, they spread counterrevolutionary fallacies like "Shanbei saving the Central Committee." Traditional education has class characteristics and serves a certain class. Their so-called "conducting revolutionary tradition education" is essentially using the red flag to oppose the red flag, using the pretext of conducting revolutionary tradition education to oppose conducting revolutionary tradition education, peddling anti-party black goods; it is stealing Chairman Mao's revolutionary points to oppose Chairman Mao, oppose Mao Zedong Thought, and oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; it is standing on the counterrevolutionary bourgeois stance to openly compete with the proletariat for the next generation; it is attempting to make our young generation deviate from revolutionary traditions, forget revolutionary traditions, and erase the brightest red sun from our young generation's minds, so that our young generation follows them on the counterrevolutionary road of opposing the party and opposing socialism. They fear that the Gao Gang anti-party clique will have no successors, worry that the bourgeoisie will be cut off, and are concerned that revisionism will be extinguished. Thus, they resort to all means to use artistic means to corrupt the young generation, cultivate counterrevolutionary revisionist seedlings, and achieve their evil goal of restoring capitalism.

Tell you, the remnants of the Gao Gang anti-party clique and their representative, the Chinese Khrushchev: We are revolutionary youth who grew up in the Mao Zedong era, armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. You want to find your successors among our young generation; that is a futile dream, a daydream! We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, criticize and repudiate revisionism, thoroughly reform our worldview, and become reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, so that the ironclad socialist mountains will never change color!

    反动影片《红河激浪》的炮制者及高岗反党集团余孽，曾经公开叫嚷：《红河激浪》“拍成电影可向全国宣传，进行革命传统教育”，“是对六亿人民的教育”，“是对青年一代及后一代的教育”，“要让我们子孙后代看看他们的先辈是怎样打天下的”。
    这是货真价实地打着“红旗”反红旗。这是地地道道的反革命黑话。
    对年青一代进行革命传统教育，这是无产阶级的革命口号，是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的伟大战略措施。其目的在于使在幸福中成长的年青一代，懂得什么是阶级压迫，什么是阶级剥削，懂得中国无产阶级和广大劳动人民在毛主席的领导下，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，怎样前赴后继，英勇奋斗，推翻了压在中国人民头上的三座大山，取得伟大胜利的。从而使青年一代，继承和发扬无产阶级光荣的革命传统，沿着毛主席所开辟的胜利航道英勇前进。但是，高岗反党集团余孽，却接过了这一无产阶级的革命口号，抽去了无产阶级的革命内容，塞进了反革命的黑货。
    一九五八年，西北地区和原甘肃省委内走资本主义道路的当权派及高岗反党集团余孽，借“纪念革命先烈”、“对青年一代及后一代进行共产主义教育”为名，掀起了一股为高岗反党集团翻案的逆流。同年九月，彭、高反党集团的一个黑干将，三下兰州，面授机宜，阴谋策划为高岗翻案。反动影片《红河激浪》的炮制工作就在这个黑干将的指使下，正式开张。
    《红河激浪》的炮制者煞费苦心地玩弄借尸还魂的伎俩，把高岗装扮成一个“英雄”、“党的领导”、“人民的救星”、“穷人的希望”。他们篡改历史，混淆黑白，极力宣扬所谓“陕北救中央”的反动谬论。在整个影片中，根本不表现毛主席的英明领导，不歌颂毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，他们嚎叫“要向全国宣传，要进行革命传统教育”的反动实质是昭然若揭的。
    “假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去”。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在甘肃的代理人和高岗反党集团余孽，他们不是向全国宣传毛主席如何领导陕甘宁军民创建革命根据地、如何粉碎蒋介石第三次“围剿”的英雄业绩；而是篡改历史，颠倒黑白，鼓吹高岗的流寇主义，为高岗歌功颂德，树碑立传。他们不是宣传毛主席如何领导工农红军艰苦奋斗、与阶级敌人进行斗争、和王明路线、高岗流寇主义进行斗争的革命传统；而是散播那些“陕北救中央”之类的反革命谬论。传统教育是有阶级性的，是为一定阶级服务的，他们所说的要进行“革命传统教育”，实质上是打着“红旗”反红旗，打着进行革命传统教育的幌子，来反对进行革命传统教育，贩卖反党黑货；是盗用毛主席的革命论点，来反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；是站在资产阶级反革命的立场上明目张胆地与无产阶级争夺下一代；是妄图叫我们青年一代背离革命的传统，忘记革命传统，想从我们青年一代心目中摘掉我们心中最红最红的红太阳，好叫我们青年一代跟着他们走反党、反社会主义的反革命道路。他们唯恐高岗反党集团后继无人，担心资产阶级断子绝孙，忧虑修正主义灭种绝后，于是便不择手段地利用艺术的手段腐蚀青年一代，培育反革命修正主义的苗子，以达到他们复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。
    告诉你们，高岗反党集团余孽及其总代表中国赫鲁晓夫：我们是生长在毛泽东时代的革命青年，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命青年，我们无限忠于毛主席，你们想在我们青年一代寻找你们的接班人，那是痴心妄想，白日作梦！我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，斗私批修，彻底改造世界观，做一个无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人，让社会主义铁打的江山永不变色！
