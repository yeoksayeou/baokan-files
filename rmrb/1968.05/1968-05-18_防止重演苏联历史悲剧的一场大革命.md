Just as we solemnly commemorate the second anniversary of the issuance of the "Notice" personally drafted by our great leader Chairman Mao, the editorial departments of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily have published the article "An Era-Making Document." This important article expounds on the great significance of the "Notice," summarizes the great victories of the Cultural Revolution over the past two years, conveys the new battle orders from Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Deputy Chairman Lin, and points the way forward for the entire military and civilian population of the nation as they press on to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. "Chairman Mao instructs me to carry it out, Chairman Mao waves his hand and I advance." We must study this diligently, understand it deeply, and carry it out resolutely.

The "Notice" of May 16, 1966, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, is a beacon of radiant light for continuing the revolution under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the most powerful ideological weapon for preventing and opposing revisionism. This era-making document has great and far-reaching significance for the international communist movement.

Lenin and Stalin established the first socialist state in the Soviet Union, but later, the power was usurped by the Khrushchev revisionist clique, turning the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and transforming socialism into capitalism, resulting in a major setback in Soviet history. This serious historical lesson tells us that under socialist conditions, there still exists a struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. "If things are not handled properly, the restoration of capitalism is a real possibility at any time," and we must never forget this.

Our great leader Chairman Mao clearly instructs us in the "Notice": "Representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles are a group of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Some of these individuals have been exposed by us, while others have not. Some are being trusted by us and are being groomed as our successors, such as the Khrushchev type of individuals. They are now sleeping by our side. All levels of the Party committee must pay full attention to this."

Our great leader Chairman Mao, summarizing the historical experience of the international communist movement, including the bitter lessons of the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union, personally initiated and led this unprecedented Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. This revolution is aimed at uprooting the roots of revisionism, preventing counter-revolutionary revisionists from seizing leadership, preventing the dictatorship of the proletariat from turning into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, preventing the restoration of capitalism in China, and preventing the tragedy of Soviet history from repeating in China.

Under the guidance of the "Notice," which shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, the surging tide of the Cultural Revolution has swept away the bourgeois headquarters within our Party led by the Chinese Khrushchev, exposed the counter-revolutionary revisionists who are anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought, as well as the traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionary two-faced individuals, and smashed their evil plots to overthrow our proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism, achieving great victories. Over the past two years, the intense class struggle in the Cultural Revolution has deeply educated us, making us realize that only by following the path indicated by the "Notice" personally drafted by Chairman Mao and carrying the Cultural Revolution to the end can we prevent and oppose revisionism, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ensure that our great motherland will never change color.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is, in essence, a political revolution under socialist conditions, where the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses led by it, and the Nationalist Party reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's great instruction makes us more clearly understand that the handful of top capitalist roaders within the Party, who have been exposed by the broad revolutionary masses, represent the interests of the Nationalist Party reactionaries, imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They are the traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionary revisionists of various kinds hidden within our Party. These individuals are the Khrushchevs sleeping by our side, the time bombs buried within our Party, and the most dangerous enemies of the proletariat under socialist conditions. If we do not expose and overthrow them, our great motherland will change color, and we will repeat the historical tragedy of the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union and all countries ruled by the revisionist traitor cliques, returning to the dark era of Nationalist Party reactionary rule.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the seizure of power and the consolidation of power. The counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for the maintenance of their power." To prevent the tragedy of Soviet history from repeating in China, we must firmly grasp the power in the hands of the revolutionary faction of the proletariat. In the Cultural Revolution, under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, we have seized back all the great powers usurped by the handful of top capitalist roaders within the Party, such as the Chinese Khrushchev, and their agents in various departments and regions, and put them in the hands of the revolutionary faction of the proletariat. However, we must fully recognize that class struggle is far from over, and the proletariat may lose power after seizing it. We must remember Chairman Mao's great teachings and never forget that the fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power, and we must never relax in consolidating our proletarian revolutionary power.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon for opposing and preventing revisionism. To prevent the historical tragedy of the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union from repeating in China, the most fundamental thing is to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively, use Mao Zedong Thought to arm the minds of hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel, and build an iron wall to oppose and prevent revisionism. In the midst of the revolutionary upsurge, we are determined to better use the theory, line, policy, and principles proposed by Chairman Mao in the "Notice" for continuing the revolution under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, arm ourselves, follow the revolutionary course indicated by Chairman Mao, remain humble and cautious, press on to victory, and achieve new merits for the people in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution!

    防止重演苏联历史悲剧的一场大革命
    “支左爱民模范排”
    正当我们隆重纪念伟大导师毛主席亲自主持制定的《通知》发表两周年的时候，《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》编辑部的文章《划时代的文献》发表了。这篇重要文章阐述了《通知》的伟大意义，总结了两年来无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，传达了毛主席和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的新的战斗号令，为正在乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的全国军民指明了前进的方向。“毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进”，我们一定认真学习，深刻领会，坚决照办。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》，是在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的光芒万丈的灯塔，是防止和反对修正主义的最强大的思想武器。这一划时代的文献，对于国际共产主义运动具有伟大、深远的意义。
    列宁和斯大林在苏联创建了第一个社会主义国家，但是，后来被赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡夺了政权，使苏联由无产阶级专政变成了资产阶级专政，由社会主义演变为资本主义，造成了苏联历史的大倒退。这个严重的历史教训告诉我们，在社会主义国家仍然存在着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，“如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的”，我们千万不要忘记这一点。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席在《通知》中明确指示我们：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。这些人物，有些已被我们识破了，有些则还没有被识破，有些正在受到我们信用，被培养为我们的接班人，例如赫鲁晓夫那样的人物，他们现正睡在我们的身旁，各级党委必须充分注意这一点。”
    我们伟大领袖毛主席总结了国际共产主义运动的历史经验，包括苏联复辟资本主义的惨痛教训，亲自发动和领导了这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。这场大革命就是为了挖掉修正主义根子，防止反革命修正主义分子篡夺领导权，防止无产阶级专政变成资产阶级专政，防止资本主义在中国复辟，防止苏联的历史悲剧在中国重演。
    在闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的《通知》的指引下，无产阶级文化大革命的滚滚洪流，把隐藏在我们党内的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部冲垮了，把那些反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的反革命修正主义分子，把那些叛徒、特务、反革命两面派冲刷出来了，粉碎了他们颠覆我国无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，取得了伟大的胜利。两年来，在无产阶级文化大革命中，惊心动魄的阶级斗争现实，深深地教育了我们，使我们认识到，只有按照毛主席亲自主持制定的《通知》指引的道路，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，才能防止和反对修正主义，巩固无产阶级专政，保证我们伟大的祖国永不变色。
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席这一伟大指示，使我们更加清楚地认识到，被广大革命群众揪出来的党内一小撮最大的走资派，就是代表国民党反动派利益，代表帝国主义、资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右利益的反革命黑帮。他们是隐藏在我们党内的形形色色的叛徒、特务和反革命修正主义分子。这些家伙是睡在我们身边的赫鲁晓夫，是埋在我们党内的定时炸弹，是社会主义条件下无产阶级的最危险的敌人。如果不把他们揪出来，打翻在地，我们伟大的祖国就会改变颜色，重演苏联和一切被修正主义叛徒集团统治的国家复辟资本主义的历史悲剧，就会回到国民党反动统治的黑暗时代。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”要防止苏联的历史悲剧在中国重演，必须把政权牢牢地掌握在无产阶级革命派手里。在无产阶级文化大革命中，在我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在各部门、各地区的代理人所窃据的大权，统统夺回到无产阶级革命派手里来了。但是，我们必须充分认识到，阶级斗争还远远没有结束，无产阶级取得政权以后，还可能丧失政权。我们要牢记毛主席的伟大教导，千万不要忘记革命的根本问题是政权问题，一刻也不放松地来巩固我们的无产阶级革命政权。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是反修防修的强大思想武器。要不使苏联复辟资本主义的历史悲剧在中国重演，最根本的就是要活学活用、学好用好毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装亿万军民的头脑，筑起反修防修的钢铁长城。在革命的大好形势下，我们决心更好地用毛主席在《通知》中提出的在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，把自己武装起来，沿着毛主席指引的革命航向，戒骄戒躁，乘胜前进，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，为人民立新功！
