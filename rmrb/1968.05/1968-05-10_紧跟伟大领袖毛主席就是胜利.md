The joyous news reverberates through the sky, and our blood surges with excitement. On May 8th, we, the representatives of the Guangzhou Railway Bureau Military Control Committee and the railway protection troops who participated in the national railway and transportation conference, with hearts filled with immense joy, excitement, exhilaration, and happiness, received the warm reception from our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, as well as other central leaders. This is an unforgettable and happiest event in the political life of all comrades in the Guangzhou Railway Bureau Military Control Committee and the stationed railway protection troops.

At this happiest moment, all of us who were received felt our hearts surge with passion, our blood boil with joy, and tears of happiness flow. We shouted a thousand times, ten thousand times with all our hearts: Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao! This warm reception has given us boundless warmth and added immeasurable strength.

At this moment of joyously acclaiming the warm reception from our great leader Chairman Mao, we will never forget Chairman Mao's greatest concern and trust for our People's Liberation Army. We will never forget Chairman Mao's greatest honor and sincere expectations for us. We must transform our profound proletarian feelings of boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao into immense material force.

Looking back over the past year, all military control and railway protection personnel of the Guangzhou Railway Bureau have followed the warm instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao to "support the leftist masses," correctly handled relations with the masses, and started from the fundamental interests of the people. We firmly believed in and relied on the majority of the masses, guiding the revolutionary cadres and workers of our bureau to study and apply Chairman Mao's thoughts, arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and achieving one victory after another. Recently, under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary committees and the excellent situation nationwide, and driven by the national railway and transportation conference, the revolutionary committee of the Guangzhou Railway Bureau was born in victory. This is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Winning nationwide victory is only the first step in the Long March of ten thousand li." At this moment of joyously celebrating the warm reception from our great leader Chairman Mao, we must always remember Chairman Mao's great teaching, and together with the revolutionary cadres and workers of our bureau, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, always highlight proletarian politics, consciously spark a revolution in the depths of our souls, and accelerate the revolutionization of our thoughts. We must always be loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao, loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must closely follow our great leader Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, resolutely oppose rightist opportunism, rightist splitism, and rightist capitulationism, and smash the rightist reversal of verdicts. We must launch a fierce attack on all class enemies, root out all the handful of capitalist roaders and hidden traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries within our party, smash all their plots of restoration and counter-revolution, and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must further consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination, focus on the revolution, vigorously promote production, and welcome the new high tide of national industrial and agricultural production. We are determined to closely follow our great leader Chairman Mao and strive to the end for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
