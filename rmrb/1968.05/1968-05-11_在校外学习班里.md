At Dongdaqiao Primary School, whenever people mention the off-campus study class that Sun Wanchun is in, they all say it is well-run.

These Little Red Guards in the off-campus study class study Chairman Mao's works diligently and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and their performance is excellent.

One day, after the off-campus study class had just finished, Sun Wanchun invited a few classmates to go out and do good deeds. They braved the howling north wind and came to Dongdaqiao. They saw a child fall into an ice hole. Sun Wanchun took a quick step onto the ice, but before he could steady himself, he heard a "crack" and fell in. Ice shards pierced his hands and face like steel needles. Sun Wanchun recited Chairman Mao's quote: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." He used both hands to hold onto the child who had fallen into the water, but his feet sank deeper and deeper into the mud. The water rose from his chest to his chin, and his whole body began to go numb. At that moment, the benevolent face of the great leader Chairman Mao appeared before his eyes, and he suddenly gained boundless strength. He struggled to lift the child and moved step by step towards the shore. People who heard the news rushed over and pulled them both to safety.

After being rescued, the child who fell into the water was out of danger. The next day, the child's parents, with tears in their eyes, brought a shiny set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" to thank Sun Wanchun. Sun Wanchun said, "Chairman Mao told me to do this. If you want to thank someone, thank Chairman Mao."

Where Does the Willpower Come From?

Wang Xuewen, a student at Jiudao Bay Primary School, had polio and her legs did not listen to her commands. However, since the off-campus Mao Zedong Thought study class was established, she has never been absent.

One morning, a classmate did not come to the off-campus Mao Zedong Thought study class. Wang Xuewen thought: I can go without eating or sleeping, but I cannot stop studying Chairman Mao's works! I will go and call him to come, and make up this lesson!

The distance from the study class to the classmate's home was very far. She made up her mind, mustered all her strength, leaned against the wall, and walked towards the classmate's home. Due to her legs not listening to her commands, she fell several times on the way, but she thought of Chairman Mao's teaching: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." She got up again after falling and persisted until she reached the classmate's home. However, the classmate not only did not listen to her persuasion but also mocked her.

Wang Xuewen was not discouraged and continued to persuade the classmate patiently. She said, "Setting up the study class is a great call from Chairman Mao. Aren't we supposed to be loyal to Chairman Mao? Attending the study class is a concrete manifestation of our loyalty to Chairman Mao!"

The classmate heard her words and came to his senses. He said to her, "I was wrong! Come, let's go to the study class together!" Thus, they supported each other and went to the study class, making up the Mao Zedong Thought lesson.

The Origin of "A Pair of Reds"

At Beijing Xiangchang Road Primary School, Yang Lianxiang and Jiang Guangxiu became "a pair of reds" from being sworn enemies, after going through a struggle.

Yang Lianxiang was a Little Red Guard, while Jiang Guangxiu had not yet joined. Usually, the two of them did not acknowledge each other. The school revolutionary committee called for everyone to carry out the "a pair of reds" activity. Yang Lianxiang had a fierce struggle in her mind. She thought: Jiang Guangxiu and I are sworn enemies. How can I pair up with her to become "a pair of reds"? Yang Lianxiang brought this question to the off-campus study class. She studied Chairman Mao's works and realized that her attitude towards comrades was wrong. She then took the initiative to find Jiang Guangxiu and made a self-criticism. However, she did not expect that after visiting twice, she was rebuffed both times.

Yang Lianxiang studied Chairman Mao's teaching again: "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all nationalities within the country are the basic guarantees for the success of our cause." Chairman Mao's teaching rekindled Yang Lianxiang's confidence and strengthened her courage. Thus, she went to talk to Jiang Guangxiu again.

At this time, Jiang Guangxiu was also struggling in her mind. She brought the question of how to treat Yang Lianxiang to the off-campus study class. After studying Chairman Mao's teaching on "each doing more self-criticism," she took the initiative to write a letter to Yang Lianxiang: "Yang Lianxiang, I have studied Chairman Mao's teachings and realized that I was wrong in the way I treated you. I will correct my mistakes and hope you will help me."

From then on, under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the two became "a pair of reds" in the off-campus study class.

    在校外学习班里
    谢谢毛主席
    在东大桥小学，人们一提起孙万春同学所在的那个校外学习班，都说办得好。
    这些红小兵在校外学习班里，认真学习毛主席著作，照毛主席指示办事，表现很好。
    一天，校外学习班学习刚一结束，孙万春约了几个同学到街上去做好事。他们顶着呼呼的北风来到东大桥，看见一个小孩掉进了冰窟窿。孙万春一个箭步跳上冰层，还没等他站稳，就“咔嚓”一声陷落下去。冰碴象钢针一样刺着他的手和脸。孙万春背诵毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他用双手抱住了那个落水的小孩，可是，两脚在泥里越陷越深，河水从胸口没到了下巴，浑身开始麻木起来。这时，他的眼前出现了伟大领袖毛主席的慈祥面庞，顿时增添了无穷无尽的力量。他用力把小孩举起，一步一步地向河岸移动着。闻讯赶来的人，把他们一起拉上了岸。
    经过抢救，落水的小孩脱离了危险。第二天，小孩的家长含着热泪，带着一套金光闪闪的《毛泽东选集》前来感谢孙万春。孙万春说：“毛主席叫我这样做的。要谢，就谢谢毛主席他老人家。”
    毅力哪里来？
    九道湾小学王学文同学得过小儿麻痹症，腿不听使唤。但是，自从校外毛泽东思想学习班建立以来，她从没缺过勤。
    一天早晨，有一个同学没有到校外毛泽东思想学习班来。王学文想：饭不吃觉不睡可以，学习毛主席著作可不能停啊！我去把他叫来，把这一课补上！
    从学习班到那个同学的家很远。她下定决心，使尽了全身的力气，扶着墙，向那个同学家走去。在路上由于腿不听使唤，摔倒过几次，但她想到毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，跌倒了又站起来，坚持走到了那个同学的家。可是，那个同学不但不听劝告，反而讽刺她。
    王学文并不灰心，还是耐心地说服这个同学。她说：“办学习班是毛主席的伟大号召，我们不是要忠于毛主席吗？上学习班，就是我们忠于毛主席的具体表现啊！”
    那个同学听了她的话，醒悟过来了，就对她说：
  “我错了！走，咱们一起到学习班去！”这样，他们俩互相搀扶着来到学习班，补上了毛泽东思想这一课。
    “一对红”的来历
    在北京香厂路小学，杨连香和降光秀同学由“冤家对头”变成“一对红”，是经过一番斗争的。
    杨连香是红小兵，降光秀还没参加红小兵。平时，她们二人互不理睬。校革委会号召大家开展“一对红”活动，杨连香思想上引起了激烈的斗争。她想：我和降光秀是死对头，让我和她结成一对红，那怎么行！杨连香带着这个问题，参加了校外学习班。她学习毛主席的著作，认识到自己对同志的态度不对，便主动找降光秀，作了自我批评。可是，没想到，连找两次，都碰了钉子。
    杨连香又学习了毛主席的教导：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”毛主席的教导又重新鼓起了杨连香的信心，增强了她的勇气。于是，她再一次找降光秀谈心。
    这时，降光秀思想上也在斗争着。她带着应该如何对待杨连香同学的问题，参加了校外学习班。她学习了毛主席“各自多做自我批评”的教导以后，主动给杨连香写了一封信：“杨连香同学：我学习了毛主席的教导，认识到我过去那样对待你，是我不对。我决心改正，希望你帮助我。”
    从此以后，在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，两人成了校外学习班里的“一对红”。
