The great proletarian cultural revolution guided by Mao Zedong Thought has inspired the revolutionary people of the world to dare to struggle and dare to win. The progressive student and worker movements in Western Europe and North America have combined their forces, with their struggle aimed directly at the common enemy of the world's people, American imperialism.

These countries' revisionist cliques and various traitors and scabs, who shamelessly serve the interests of the monopoly bourgeoisie, have been condemned and spit upon by the broad masses of students and workers.

New China News Agency, May 22nd: Our correspondent reports that the surging progressive student movement in Western Europe and North America is like a roaring tide, advancing relentlessly. It has fiercely assaulted the waning reactionary rule of the international monopoly bourgeoisie, demonstrating the revolutionary and rebellious fighting spirit of the students in Western Europe and North America, and indicating that the people of Western Europe and North America are becoming increasingly awakened, and the revolutionary forces are growing stronger.

The broad masses of young students in Western Europe and North America have recently launched struggles to oppose the decadent bourgeois education system, to demand democratic rights, and to oppose the aggressive policies of American imperialism and the reactionary ruling cliques of their own countries. These struggles first erupted in the heart of the major capitalist countries, such as Paris, New York, Bonn, and Rome, and quickly spread throughout these countries, affecting other capitalist countries as well. Even in countries like Spain, which have long been under reactionary dictatorship, and in countries like Switzerland, Denmark, and Sweden, where student movements have been relatively quiet, students have taken action. In Paris, France, the students' struggle, which began on May 3rd, saw the number of demonstrators on the streets increase from thousands to tens of thousands in just a week, expanding from universities to high schools and from a few schools to a citywide struggle. By May 13th, it had developed into a massive demonstration of 800,000 students, teachers, and workers. In West Germany, students held demonstrations in nearly ten cities in early February, and by April, more than 500 towns had seen demonstrations involving 300,000 people (mostly students). On May 11th, students, workers, and peasants together held a historic demonstration of 60,000 people in the West German capital of Bonn, opposing the government's policy of accelerating the fascization of West Germany. In the United States, more than 100 schools have gone on strike and held demonstrations this year. In Italy, the students' struggle against the decadent and reactionary education system quickly spread to dozens of cities, including Rome and Milan. In Sweden, the students' struggle has also reached unprecedented levels.

In this struggle, the progressive students of Western Europe and North America have faced the brutal suppression of the reactionary authorities, fearlessly and unyieldingly engaging in a protracted and tenacious struggle against the reactionary military police. This is rare in the history of student movements in Western Europe and North America. Since May 3rd, Paris students have engaged in eight consecutive days of bloody street battles with reactionary military police. They used overturned cars, construction materials, and paving stones to build more than 60 barricades in the streets of the University of Paris, singing the majestic "Internationale" and fighting back against the fully armed military police with sticks, stones, and homemade Molotov cocktails. They also bravely picked up the tear gas and stun grenades thrown by the riot police and quickly threw them back at the reactionary military police. The battles often lasted all night, turning the University of Paris into a battlefield shrouded in thick smoke and flames. In late April, black and white students at Columbia University in the United States held a massive strike, occupying five large buildings, raising red flags, and engaging in fierce battles with the fascist military police who came to suppress them. In Italy, young students seized police weapons and burned and destroyed police cars during their struggles with the police. Even under the fascist rule of Franco in Spain, students at the University of Madrid frequently clashed with the police who came to suppress their strike. All of this fully demonstrates the heroic spirit of the increasingly awakened students of Western Europe and North America.

The struggle of this massive student movement is clearly aimed at the number one enemy of the people of the world, American imperialism, and the local reactionary ruling classes. In the countries where student struggles have erupted, almost without exception, they have raised the slogan of opposing American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam. Young students in the United States have expressed their firm refusal to go to South Vietnam to be cannon fodder for American imperialism's war of aggression, and have burned their draft cards; while students in Western European countries have repeatedly organized protests and demonstrations, shouting slogans such as "Yankees go home from Vietnam!" "Johnson is a murderer!" "Down with American imperialism!" and so on. Many countries' students have angrily burned American flags and effigies of Johnson, and attacked American diplomatic missions. Students' demands to reform the decadent education system, to demand democratic rights, and to improve the living conditions of poor students are increasingly developing into struggles against the government's internal and external reactionary policies, and opening fire on the local reactionary ruling classes. In particular, the reactionary authorities' bloody suppression of the student movement has further educated them, leading them to raise more combative slogans, such as "Oppose the repression of the bourgeois state machine!" "We will use revolutionary violence to oppose bourgeois violence!" and so on. Progressive students in countries like Spain, France, and Italy have even raised the slogan of overthrowing the local reactionary regimes.

It is worth noting that the student movement in Western Europe and North America is beginning to combine with the worker movement, which is an extremely important new development in the people's movement in the capitalist world. Students in countries such as France, Italy, West Germany, and Spain have all responded to and supported each other in their struggles with workers. In France, the working class held a nationwide general strike of 10 million people on May 13th to support the Paris students' struggle. On that day, 800,000 workers, students, and teachers in Paris held the largest mass demonstration since the end of World War II in France. They held up a 10-meter-long banner that read: "Students, teachers, and workers unite!" French workers also occupied Paris University together with students, and when workers occupied factories and held indefinite political and economic strikes, students traveled long distances, carrying banners to support workers' struggles. The united struggle of French workers and students shook the entire country and dealt a powerful blow to the French ruling class. Students at the University of Cologne in West Germany also invited workers into the school to hold a joint rally against capitalist exploitation. On this year's May 1st International Labor Day, university students in Italy and Spain participated in workers' celebrations. In some countries, progressive students and workers have established regular contacts.

The surging progressive student movement in Western Europe and North America is inseparable from the great influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has inspired the revolutionary people of the world with the heroic spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win. Students in France, Italy, West Germany, the United States, Spain, and other countries have broken away from the traditional methods of sit-ins and petitions in this struggle, and have used bold resistance actions to challenge the capitalist state machine. They have ignored the government's threats and intimidation, occupied school buildings, and even occupied the principal's office, taken over the school's broadcasting station and publications, detained reactionary teachers, and searched for secret documents related to the persecution of students and their connections with spy agencies. Many schools' students have established various organizations to manage the schools themselves. For example, 18 universities in France have established "Occupation Committees." After occupying the schools, students have held various discussion meetings and courses on workers' movements and student movements, and have continuously engaged in heated discussions on education system issues. Moreover, the fighting students have taken to the streets with red flags, singing the "Internationale," and bravely built barricades and fought with the military police. In the city center, they have raised one red flag after another, attacked newspapers and radio stations that opposed the student movement, and left the reactionary ruling authorities in a state of panic and disarray.

It is particularly worth noting that the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has accelerated the spread of invincible Mao Zedong Thought in Western Europe and North America. In these regions, the number of students studying the works of Chairman Mao and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" is increasing. Some students at the University of Paris have hung portraits of Chairman Mao, raised the Chinese flag, and posted quotations from Chairman Mao in the schoolyard, expressing their boundless respect and love for the great leader of the proletariat, Chairman Mao. Students in France, Italy, West Germany, and other countries have held up portraits of Chairman Mao and red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" during demonstrations and marches. Students in Rome have also posted Chairman Mao's quotations such as "If the enemy opposes us, that's good, that means we have drawn a clear line with the enemy" to guide the struggle and inspire the fighting spirit.

Faced with this surging student movement, the reactionaries in Western Europe and North America are in a state of panic. They have universally used a combination of violent suppression and political deception to deal with the broad masses of progressive students. In France, where the student movement has been the most intense, the De Gaulle government closed the University of Paris on May 3rd and dispatched tens of thousands of police, gendarmes, and security forces over the following days, using poison gas, tear gas, and stun grenades to brutally suppress the unarmed students and teachers. Many students were seriously injured by the poison gas; a large number of students and teachers were beaten or illegally arrested. At the same time, De Gaulle personally engaged in political deception. On the one hand, he hypocritically stated that the government was prepared to make some "reforms" to higher education; on the other hand, he blatantly threatened to "use all means to maintain public order." The reactionary authorities in the United States, West Germany, and Italy have also taken savage measures to suppress the surging student movement.

In the face of this surging student movement, the revisionist cliques and various traitors and scabs in these countries have shamelessly played the despicable role of serving the interests of the monopoly bourgeoisie, earning the angry condemnation and contempt of the broad masses of students. The French revisionist clique was terrified by this massive popular movement. At the beginning, they labeled the revolutionary students as "anarchists" and "leftist adventurists," and when the student movement flourished, they turned to using the tactic of fake support and real betrayal, attempting to infiltrate the student movement to carry out sabotage. However, this trick was exposed by the student masses and completely failed. It is no wonder that bourgeois newspapers also admit that the French revisionist clique is the "helper" and "natural ally" of the French monopoly bourgeoisie.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur, and will certainly achieve victory, whether sooner or later." No matter how the reactionary ruling classes of Western European and North American countries play their counterrevolutionary two-faced tricks, and no matter how the modern revisionists act as accomplices, the flames of the student movement in Western Europe and North America are indestructible, and they will burn more fiercely as the revolutionary forces in this region continue to grow!

    毛泽东思想指引下的无产阶级文化大革命鼓舞世界革命人民敢于斗争敢于胜利
    西欧北美进步学生运动和工人运动相结合  斗争矛头直指世界人民的公敌美帝国主义
    这些国家的修正主义集团和形形色色叛徒、工贼赤裸裸地为垄断资产阶级效劳，遭到广大学生和工人的谴责和唾弃
    新华社二十二日讯　本社记者报道：西欧、北美地区波澜壮阔的进步学生运动，象汹涌的怒涛，正在滚滚向前。它猛烈地冲击着国际垄断资产阶级摇摇欲坠的反动统治，显示了西欧、北美学生敢于革命、敢于造反的战斗精神，表明了西欧、北美人民正在日益觉醒，革命力量正在日益壮大。
    西欧、北美的广大青年学生，最近为反对腐朽的资产阶级教育制度，争取民主权利，反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和本国反动统治集团而展开的斗争，首先从主要资本主义国家的心脏地区如巴黎、纽约、波恩、罗马等城市爆发，随即几乎席卷了这些国家的全国，并波及其它资本主义国家。连一直处于反动独裁统治下的西班牙和通常学生运动比较沉寂的瑞士、丹麦和瑞典等国，学生们也行动起来了。法国巴黎学生的斗争，在三日开始的短短一周内，上街示威的学生就从数千人增加到数万人，从大学扩展到中学，从几个学校扩展到全市学生的共同斗争，到十三日形成了学生、教师和工人联合举行的声势空前浩大的八十万人大示威。在西德，学生们今年二月初在近十个城市举行了示威，到了四月，就有五百多个城镇爆发了共有三十万人（其中大部分是学生）参加的游行示威。五月十一日，学生们同工人、农民一起，在西德首都波恩举行了西德历史上空前的六万人大示威，反对政府加速西德法西斯化的政策。在美国，今年以来，已有一百多所学校罢课和游行示威。意大利学生反对腐朽、反动的教育制度的斗争，在短短的几个月内迅速发展到罗马、米兰等几十个城市。在瑞典，学生的斗争也具有了空前的规模。
    西欧、北美各国的进步学生，在这次斗争中面对反动当局的残酷镇压，不畏强暴，不怕牺牲，同反动军警展开了持久、顽强的斗争。这在西欧、北美的学生运动史上是少有的。巴黎学生从五月三日开始，在大街上同反动军警进行了连续八天的浴血搏斗。他们用推翻的汽车、工地上的木料、铺路的石头在巴黎大学区街上筑起了六十多道街垒，高唱着雄壮的《国际歌》，用棍棒、石块和自制的燃烧瓶反击全副武装的军警。他们还冒着生命危险，勇敢地捡起宪兵警察扔过来的催泪弹和震荡手榴弹，迅速地扔回去打击反动军警。战斗经常彻夜进行，通宵达旦，使巴黎大学区成了浓烟弥漫，火光熊熊的战场。美国哥伦比亚黑人学生和白人学生在四月底举行的大罢课斗争中，占领了学校的五座大楼，升起了红旗，并和前去镇压的法西斯军警进行了激烈的搏斗。意大利的青年学生在同警察的搏斗中缴获了警察的枪支，焚烧和捣毁了警车。就是在佛朗哥法西斯统治下的西班牙，马德里大学的学生也经常同前去镇压他们罢课运动的警察进行斗争。这一切充分表明了正在日益觉醒的西欧、北美学生的英雄气概。
  　这次声势浩大的学生运动的斗争矛头，都明确指向全世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义和当地的反动统治。在爆发学生斗争的国家中，几乎都毫无例外地提出了反对美帝国主义侵略越南战争的口号。美国的青年学生表示坚决拒绝到南越去充当美帝侵略战争的炮灰，纷纷烧毁征兵证；而西欧国家的学生则一再组织抗议示威，高呼“美国佬从越南滚出去！”“约翰逊是杀人犯！”“打倒美帝国主义！”等口号。不少国家的学生还愤怒地烧毁美国国旗和约翰逊模拟人像，袭击美国的驻外机构。学生们要求改革腐朽的教育制度，要求民主权利和改善贫苦学生生活的斗争，正越来越发展成为反对政府内外反动政策，向本国反动统治集团开火的斗争。特别是反动当局对学生运动的血腥镇压进一步教育了他们，使他们提出了一些更加战斗的口号，如“反对资产阶级国家机器的镇压！”“我们要以革命的暴力反对资产阶级的暴力”等，而西班牙、法国、意大利等国的一些进步学生还提出了要推翻本国反动政权的口号。
    值得指出的是，西欧、北美的学生运动正开始走上和工人运动相结合的道路，这是资本主义世界人民运动中的一个极其重要的新发展。法国、意大利、西德和西班牙等国的学生在斗争中都同工人相互呼应，相互支持，并肩战斗。法国的工人阶级为了声援巴黎学生的斗争，于十三日举行了一千万人的全国总罢工。巴黎的工人和学生、教师八十万人在这一天举行了法国第二次世界大战以来规模最大的群众示威。他们高举着一条十米长的巨型横幅，上面写着：“学生、教师和工人团结起来！”法国的工人还和学生们一道共同占领了巴黎大学，而当工人们占领了工厂，举行无限期政治和经济罢工时，学生们又长途跋涉，打着旗帜来到工厂支持工人的斗争。法国工人和学生的联合斗争，震动了整个法国，给了法国统治集团有力的打击。西德科隆大学的学生也把工人请进学校，联合举行反对资本家剥削的群众大会。今年“五·一”国际劳动节，意大利和西班牙的大学生参加了工人举行的庆祝活动。还有一些国家的进步学生和工人组织建立了经常的联系。
    西欧、北美进步学生运动的蓬勃高涨，是同中国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大影响分不开的。在毛泽东思想指引下的无产阶级文化大革命，激发了全世界革命人民敢于斗争、敢于胜利的英雄气概。法国、意大利、西德、美国、西班牙等学生，在这次斗争中，打破了过去静坐、请愿等传统方式，而用勇敢的反抗行动，向资本主义国家机器展开了英雄的挑战。他们不顾政府当局的恐吓、威胁，占领学校大楼，甚至占领校长办公室，接管学校的播音室和校刊，扣押反动的教员和搜抄学校当局迫害学生和同特务机关联系的秘密文件。许多学校的学生成立各种组织，自己管理学校。如法国全国十八所大学都成立了“占领委员会”。学生们在占领学校后，自己举办了有关工人运动和学生运动的各种讨论会，开设有关美国黑人斗争等各种课程，并且不断就教育制度问题展开热烈的讨论。不仅如此，战斗的学生们还打着红旗，高唱《国际歌》，意气风发地走上街头，筑起街垒，同军警英勇奋战，在闹市升起一面面鲜艳的红旗，并袭击反对学生运动的报社和电台，使反动统治当局穷于应付，狼狈不堪。
    特别需要指出的是，中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利开展，加速了战无不胜的毛泽东思想在西欧、北美的传播，在这些地区的学生中，学习毛主席著作和《毛主席语录》的人正在不断增加。巴黎大学有些学生在校院内挂起毛主席画像，升起中国国旗，张贴毛主席语录，表现了他们对无产阶级伟大导师毛主席的无限崇敬和热爱。法国、意大利、西德等国家的不少学生在示威游行时高举毛主席像和红彤彤的《毛主席语录》。罗马学生还张贴了毛主席的“如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了”等语录来指导斗争，鼓舞斗志。
    面对这场汹涌澎湃的学生运动，西欧、北美各国反动派惊恐万状。他们普遍交替使用暴力镇压和政治欺骗的反革命两手，来对付广大进步学生。在这次学生运动最为猛烈的法国，戴高乐政府在五月三日封闭了巴黎大学后，连日出动成千上万的警察、宪兵和保安部队，使用毒气、催泪弹、震荡手榴弹等武器，对手无寸铁的学生和教师进行血腥镇压。不少学生受到毒气的严重伤害；还有大批学生和教师被打伤或遭到无理逮捕。同时，戴高乐又亲自出马，进行政治欺骗。他一方面假惺惺地表示，政府准备对高等教育作一些“改革”；另一方面却露骨地威胁要“尽一切办法维持公共秩序”。美国、西德和意大利等反动当局也都对日益高涨的学生运动采取了野蛮的镇压。
    在这次高涨的学生运动面前，这些国家里的修正主义集团和形形色色的叛徒、工贼赤裸裸地扮演了为垄断资产阶级效劳的可耻角色，遭到了广大学生群众的愤怒斥责和唾弃。法国修正主义集团被这场轰轰烈烈的群众运动吓破了胆。他们一开始就给革命学生扣上“无政府主义者”、“左倾冒险主义者”等罪名，等到学生运动蓬勃开展后，又转而采取假支持真出卖的手段，妄图打进学生运动中去进行破坏，但是这一伎俩遭到了学生群众的揭露而彻底破产。难怪资产阶级报刊也承认，法国修正主义集团是法国垄断资产阶级的“帮手”和“天生的盟友”。
    我们伟大导师毛主席指出：“不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”不管西欧、北美各国反动统治集团怎样玩弄反革命两面手法，也不管现代修正主义者们如何为虎作伥，西欧、北美学生运动的烈火是扑不灭的，它必将随着这个地区革命力量的不断壮大而越烧越旺！
