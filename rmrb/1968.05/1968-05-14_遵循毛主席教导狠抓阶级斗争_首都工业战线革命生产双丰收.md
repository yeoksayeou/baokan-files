	Follow Chairman Mao's Instructions to Intensify Class Struggle
	Capital's Industrial Front Achieves Dual Harvests in Revolution and Production

	Ninety-seven percent of central and municipal industrial and mining enterprises have established revolutionary committees. The revolutionary committees have led the workers in carrying out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, greatly raising the class consciousness and line struggle consciousness of revolutionary workers, and effectively promoting the development of production. The city's industrial production level in March increased by 28 percent compared to February, and in April, it increased by another 7.2 percent compared to March.

	Xinhua News Agency, May 13th: The proletarian revolutionary factions and broad revolutionary workers on the capital's industrial front, with class struggle as the key link, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and carry out a vigorous revolution and a booming production. The overall situation is getting better and better.

	Since the beginning of this year, the proletarian revolutionary factions and broad revolutionary workers on the capital's industrial front have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launching a high tide of consolidating revolutionary great alliances and developing revolutionary three-in-one combinations. Ninety-seven percent of central and municipal industrial and mining enterprises have successively established revolutionary committees. As soon as these grassroots revolutionary committees were born, they raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, following Chairman Mao's great instruction of "never forget class struggle," leading the broad revolutionary workers to carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism against China's Khrushchev and other handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, actively launching a fierce attack on the class enemies, greatly raising the class consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought on the industrial front to a new high, and further mobilizing the revolutionary and productive enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary workers. In March, the city's industrial production level increased by 28 percent compared to February. Among the 47 main industrial products, the output of 41 products increased, with pure benzene, plasticizers, sewing machines, and 14 other products seeing a doubling in output. On the basis of the significant increase in production in March, the city's industrial production level in April increased by another 7.2 percent compared to March. The output of important products such as steel, fertilizer, electric motors, agricultural pumps, and machine-made paper all saw significant increases.

	In the face of the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the enemies of the proletariat are unwilling to accept their defeat and are desperately struggling. The capital's working class, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, takes the initiative to strike and pursue the handful of class enemies, setting up battlefields for revolutionary criticism from workshops, offices, teams to workers' dormitory areas, exposing these class enemies and smashing their various plots to sabotage the revolution and production. The practical struggle in various units has proven: "Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." Through intensifying class struggle, a batch of advanced factories and mines have reached a new level, and both revolution and production have presented a new situation; some backward units are also rapidly changing their appearance, and some have quickly caught up.

	In the revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary workers in the capital have further launched a new high tide of the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Many factory and mine workers have deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to fiercely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of China's Khrushchev and other handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and at the same time combining the struggle against selfishness with the criticism of revisionism, sparking a revolution in the depths of their souls, breaking selfishness and establishing public spirit, promoting their own thought revolutionization. With the improvement of the proletarian consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers, evil winds and practices are consciously resisted and criticized by the masses. In many factories and mines, when one side encounters difficulties, support comes from all directions, and taking on heavy responsibilities for the revolution has become a norm. Many factory and mine workers, following Chairman Mao's instruction of "to carry out the revolution through further economizing," while striving to increase production, have carried out technological innovation and technological revolution activities, opening up sources and economizing, saving a large amount of coal and other raw materials and supplies.

	Chairman Mao teaches: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." After the establishment of revolutionary committees in various factories and mines on the Beijing industrial front, they have all placed the leadership of the broad revolutionary workers in fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev and his agents' promotion of the counter-revolutionary revisionist lines of "production first," "technology first," "profit in command," "material incentives," and "expert path" in a prominent position, striving to highlight proletarian politics, using proletarian politics to command production, business, and all work, and intensifying the thought revolutionization of people. Many units' revolutionary committee leaders regularly go to the workshops to work, study Chairman Mao's works, and criticize bourgeoisie together with the workers, receiving good evaluations from the masses.

	Currently, the proletarian revolutionary factions and broad revolutionary workers on the capital's industrial front are, with even greater revolutionary enthusiasm, intensifying the revolution and vigorously promoting production, determined to make the revolution and production even better, and to achieve new victories in the struggle for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    遵循毛主席教导狠抓阶级斗争
    首都工业战线革命生产双丰收
    百分之九十七的中央和市属工矿企业成立了革委会。革委会带领职工深入持久开展革命大批判，大大提高革命职工的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟，有力地推动了生产的发展。全市工业生产水平三月份比二月份猛增百分之二十八，四月份又比三月份增长百分之七点二
    新华社十三日讯　首都工业战线无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，以阶级斗争为纲，坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，革命轰轰烈烈，生产热气腾腾，整个形势越来越好。
    今年年初以来，首都工业战线无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，掀起了巩固革命大联合、发展革命三结合的高潮，百分之九十七的中央和市属工矿企业相继成立了革命委员会。这些基层革命委员会一诞生，就高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，带领广大革命职工向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派开展深入持久的革命大批判，主动向阶级敌人发起了猛烈进攻，大大提高了广大革命职工的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟，把工业战线上活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向了新的高潮，进一步调动了广大革命职工革命和生产的积极性。三月份，全市工业生产水平比二月份猛增百分之二十八，四十七种主要工业产品中，四十一种产品的产量都有上升，其中纯苯、增塑剂、缝纫机等十四种产品产量成倍增长。在三月份生产大幅度增长的基础上，四月份全市工业生产水平又比三月份增长了百分之七点二，钢、化肥、电机、农业泵、机制纸等重要产品的产量都有较大的增长。
    在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的大好形势下，无产阶级的敌人不甘心于他们的失败，千方百计地进行垂死挣扎。用毛泽东思想武装起来的首都工人阶级，对这一小撮阶级敌人主动出击，穷追猛打，从车间、科室、班组到职工家属宿舍区，到处都摆开了革命大批判的战场，把这一小撮阶级敌人批得无处藏身，粉碎了他们妄图破坏革命和生产的种种阴谋诡计。各个单位的斗争实践证明：“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”通过狠抓阶级斗争，一批先进的厂矿更上一层楼，革命和生产都出现了新的局面；一些后进的单位，也正在迅速改变面貌，有的已经很快赶了上来。
    首都广大革命职工在革命的大批判中，进一步掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的新高潮。许多厂矿的革命职工，对伟大领袖毛主席满怀深厚的无产阶级感情，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义谬论，同时把斗私和批修结合起来，在灵魂深处爆发革命，破私立公，促进自己的思想革命化。随着广大革命职工无产阶级觉悟的提高，歪风邪气受到群众自觉的抵制和批判。在许多厂矿里，一方有困难，四面八方主动来支援，为革命争挑重担，已经成为一种风尚。许多厂矿的革命职工遵照毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的教导，在努力增产的同时，通过开展技术革新、技术革命活动，开源节流，节约了大量的煤炭和其他原料、材料。
    毛主席教导说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”北京工业战线各厂矿的革命委员会成立以后，都把领导广大革命职工狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的“生产第一”、“技术第一”、“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”、“专家路线”等反革命修正主义路线放在突出的地位，努力突出无产阶级政治，用无产阶级政治统帅生产、业务和一切工作，狠抓人的思想革命化。不少单位的革委会领导成员，定期下车间和工人一道劳动，一道学习毛主席著作，一道批判资产阶级，受到了群众的好评。
    目前，首都工业战线无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，正以更大的革命干劲，狠抓革命，猛促生产，决心把革命和生产搞得更好，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中立新功。
