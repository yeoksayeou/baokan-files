Madrid workers, defying the repression of Spain's Franco regime, held demonstrations on April 30, marking the beginning of a three-day nationwide "day of struggle" against the fascist rule of Franco.

The "day of struggle" was initiated by Spain's underground trade unions, calling on workers to hold various demonstrations before and after May 1, International Labor Day, to protest against rising prices, increasing unemployment, and the brutal repression of workers by the reactionary authorities, and to demand freedom for trade unions.

The Franco regime, fearing that the workers' demonstrations would further ignite the Spanish people's struggle against Franco's dictatorship, is desperately trying to suppress them. Police authorities arrested about 150 trade union activists illegally in the week leading up to the "day of struggle" and threatened to detain and fire workers who participate in the demonstrations. On April 30, thousands of fully armed police were deployed across Madrid, with helicopters patrolling overhead.

However, Madrid workers overcame these difficulties and held demonstrations at four locations.

In the southern part of Madrid's city center, Atoche Square, thousands of workers and students chanted slogans such as "Down with Franco" and "Democracy, not dictatorship," and marched in protest on nearby streets. They dispersed and suddenly gathered, catching the police off guard.

In the eastern part of Madrid, at the site of the Monument to the Fallen, a thousand workers held up signs protesting against the Franco regime and held a demonstration.

In the northern part of Madrid, several hundred workers also chanted slogans like "Freedom" and "Democracy, not dictatorship" and held a demonstration, engaging in a struggle with police armed with clubs. In the industrial center of Hetafe on the outskirts of Madrid, six hundred workers also held a demonstration.

Many factory workers, unable to reach the four designated gathering points due to police obstruction, held demonstrations near their factories.

　　反对西班牙佛朗哥法西斯统治　争取自由和民主
　　马德里工人举行全国“斗争日”示威
    新华社一日讯　马德里消息：马德里工人不顾西班牙佛朗哥政权的镇压，四月三十日举行示威，开始了为期三天的反对佛朗哥法西斯政权的全国性“斗争日”。
      “斗争日”是由西班牙的地下工会组织发起的，它号召工人在“五一”国际劳动节前后三天举行各种示威，抗议物价上涨、失业增加和反动统治当局对工人的残酷镇压，要求工会自由。
    佛朗哥政权害怕工人的示威会进一步引起西班牙人民反对佛朗哥独裁统治的斗争浪潮，正在竭力进行镇压。警察当局在这次“斗争日”的前一周中已经非法逮捕了约一百五十名工会积极分子，并且威胁要拘留和解雇参加示威的工人。四月三十日那一天，马德里有几千名全副武装的警察在各地布防，天上还有直升飞机巡逻。
    但是，马德里工人排除了困难，在四个地点举行了示威。
    在马德里市中心南部的阿托查广场，成千名工人和学生高呼“不要佛朗哥”、“要民主，不要独裁”的口号，在附近大街上游行示威。他们分散前往，突然集合，使警察措手不及。
    在马德里东部的死难者纪念碑所在地，一千名工人高举反对佛朗哥政权的标语牌，举行了示威。
    在马德里北部几百名工人也高呼“要自由”、“要民主，不要独裁”等口号举行了示威，并同手拿棍棒的警察进行搏斗。马德里郊区的工业中心赫塔菲，也有六百名工人举行示威。
    有许多工厂的工人，由于受到警察的无理阻拦，无法去上述四个集合地点，他们就在工厂附近举行了示威。
