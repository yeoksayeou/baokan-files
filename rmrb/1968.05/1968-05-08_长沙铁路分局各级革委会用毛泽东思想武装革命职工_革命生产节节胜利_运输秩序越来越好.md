The Longshan Railway Bureau's various levels of revolutionary committees have armed revolutionary workers with Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary production is achieving continuous victories, and the transportation order is getting better and better.

More than 150 large and small stations and sections under the jurisdiction of the bureau have already established revolutionary committees or leading groups in 98% of the units. The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is being further widely and deeply developed.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, May 7th: The various levels of revolutionary committees of the Longshan Railway Bureau, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "never forget class struggle," have led the broad revolutionary workers to launch an offensive against the class enemy, raising the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary workers, further consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. This has resulted in a great situation of revolution and production throughout the railway bureau system.

At present, 98% of the more than 150 large and small stations and sections under the jurisdiction of this bureau have established revolutionary committees or revolutionary leading groups. The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is being further widely and deeply developed. Production has been rising month by month this year, and the transportation order is getting better day by day.

The fundamental reason for the continuous victories achieved by the Longshan Railway Bureau is that the various levels of revolutionary committees have always placed the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work, insisting on arming the revolutionary workers with Mao Zedong Thought. Since last October, the entire bureau, from top to bottom, has held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, vigorously implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and promoting the development of the revolution. So far, the entire bureau has held more than 170 study classes, with 70% of the workers participating in the study. They have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle and Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions in the study classes, universally carried out bitter-sweet remembrance activities, and conducted extensive class education through comparison and remembrance. This has greatly raised the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers and strengthened their class struggle awareness.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, a revolution by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang reactionaries led by the broad revolutionary people, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The revolutionary committee of the Longshan Railway Bureau has repeatedly and seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and promptly dispatched propaganda teams led by members of the revolutionary committee to go deep into the grassroots units to propagate and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the broad revolutionary workers have launched a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. They firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, always directing the spearhead of the struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party led by China's Khrushchev, as well as hidden traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries. The revolutionary workers of the Changsha Station, in the struggle against the rightist reversal wind, have further deeply and persistently carried out revolutionary criticism, powerfully criticizing China's Khrushchev's theory of "class struggle extinction," further raising the class struggle consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness. The revolutionary workers of the Zhuzhou Railway Region have severely criticized China's Khrushchev and his agents in this region who have promoted "material incentives," "bonus system," "one-man management," and other counter-revolutionary revisionist goods. Revolutionary spirit has been greatly promoted, organizational discipline has been greatly strengthened, and the repeated black winds of anarchism and counter-revolutionary economism have been repelled by the enemies of the proletariat. Many difficulties in transportation and production have been successfully solved, and the transportation and production plans have been overfulfilled.

While leading the broad revolutionary masses to launch a fierce offensive against the enemies of the proletariat, the various levels of revolutionary committees of the Longshan Railway Bureau have paid special attention to grasping the ideological revolutionization of the leading cadres. The 36 members of the revolutionary committee, except for four who stayed to handle daily work, all went deep into the grassroots, rooted among the masses, eating, living, and working with them, taking the lead in criticizing and repudiating revisionism, propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and vigorously promoting revolution and production. In this way, they have timely understood the situation of class struggle, enriched their leadership experience, and strengthened their ties with the masses. Most of the members of the revolutionary committees or revolutionary leading groups of the grassroots units in this bureau also insist on frequently going deep into the masses, being frugal and clean, and serving the people wholeheartedly, and have been welcomed by the workers.

　　长沙铁路分局各级革委会用毛泽东思想武装革命职工
　　革命生产节节胜利　运输秩序越来越好
    分局所属一百五十多个大小站段，已有百分之九十八的单位成立了革命委员会或领导小组，活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动正进一步广泛深入开展
    据新华社长沙七日电　长沙铁路分局各级革命委员会遵循伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，率领广大革命职工主动向阶级敌人发动进攻，提高了革命职工的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，进一步巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命三结合，使整个铁路分局系统的革命和生产出现了一派大好形势。
    现在，这个分局所属一百五十多个大小站段，已有百分之九十八的单位成立了革命委员会或革命领导小组，活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动正在进一步广泛深入地开展。今年以来的生产月月上升，运输秩序一天比一天好。
    长沙铁路分局不断取得新胜利的最根本的原因，是分局各级革命委员会始终把活学活用毛泽东思想摆在一切工作的首位，坚持用毛泽东思想武装革命职工的头脑。从去年十月起，全分局从上到下，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，大力落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，推动革命胜利发展。到现在为止，全分局已办了一百七十多期学习班，百分之七十的职工参加了学习。他们在学习班里反复学习毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争的教导和毛主席的一系列最新指示，普遍开展忆苦思甜活动，大搞回忆对比的阶级教育，大大提高了广大革命职工的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，增强了阶级斗争观念。
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”长沙铁路分局革命委员会反复地认真地学习了毛主席这一最新指示，并迅速派出由革委会成员带领的毛泽东思想宣传队，深入各基层单位，宣传和贯彻毛主席的最新指示。广大革命职工在毛主席最新指示的指引下，掀起了革命大批判的新高潮。他们牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，始终把斗争矛头对准以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派，以及隐藏的叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子。长沙车站革命职工在反击右倾翻案妖风的斗争中，进一步深入持久地开展革命大批判，有力地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，进一步提高了阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。株洲铁路地区革命职工，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本地区的代理人过去推行的“物质刺激”、“奖金挂帅”、“一长制”等反革命修正主义黑货，革命精神大发扬，组织纪律性大大加强，击退了无产阶级的敌人多次刮起的无政府主义和反革命经济主义黑风，顺利地解决了运输生产中的许多困难，超额完成了运输生产计划。
    长沙铁路分局各级革命委员会在带领广大革命群众向无产阶级的敌人发动猛烈进攻的同时，特别注意狠抓领导班子的思想革命化。革委会的三十六个委员除留四人在家处理日常工作外，其余都深入基层，扎根于群众中，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动，带头斗私批修，宣传毛泽东思想，狠抓革命，猛促生产。这样，他们及时了解了阶级斗争的情况，丰富了领导经验，密切了和群众的联系。这个分局多数基层单位的革命委员会或革命领导小组成员，也都坚持经常深入群众，艰苦朴素，廉洁奉公，受到了职工群众的欢迎。
