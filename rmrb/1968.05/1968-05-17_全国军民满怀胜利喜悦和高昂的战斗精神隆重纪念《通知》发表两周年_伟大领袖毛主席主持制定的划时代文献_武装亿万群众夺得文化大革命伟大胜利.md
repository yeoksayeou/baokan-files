The entire nation, both military and civilian, is filled with the joy of victory and a high combat spirit as they solemnly commemorate the second anniversary of the issuance of the "Notice." This epoch-making document, formulated under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, has armed the masses and led to the great victory of the Cultural Revolution.

The people's revolutionary masses and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat across the country, filled with boundless love, faith, reverence, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, are celebrating with high spirits the second anniversary of the issuance of the brilliant Marxist-Leninist historical document—the "Notice" of May 16, 1966, personally formulated by Chairman Mao. They are enthusiastically hailing the unprecedented victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in politics, ideology, organization, and economics. They are enthusiastically hailing the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Under the brilliant guidance of the epoch-making document "Notice," personally formulated by the great leader Chairman Mao, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in human history has achieved decisive victories in the past two years. The proletarian revolutionaries of our country, who have created immortal achievements in the history of proletarian revolutionary struggles, the tens of millions of revolutionary masses, and the Red Guards, looking back on the two-year battle journey under the command of the great leader Chairman Mao, have reviewed the great historical document "Notice," and are determined to, under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, follow the path indicated by the "Notice," and, with vigor and enthusiasm, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They will carry forward the resolute and thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, launch even more powerful attacks on the class enemies, advance with the momentum of victory, and strive for the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

On May 16, in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other major cities, in Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Guizhou, Sichuan, Fujian, Yunnan, Xinjiang, and Tibet, as well as in the provincial capitals and autonomous region capitals, in factories, enterprises, institutions, schools, and rural communes across the country, various activities were held to solemnly commemorate the second anniversary of the issuance of the "Notice." Many places held grand rallies with tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of participants. Revolutionary committee leaders and military leaders from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions attended local commemorative meetings and delivered speeches. At the commemorative rallies across the country, people shouted thousands of times: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Long live the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts, forever, forever, and ten thousand years!"

In the commemorative activities across the country, the revolutionary masses enthusiastically praised, saying that under the inspiration of the "Notice," personally formulated by Chairman Mao, and under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the unprecedented massive revolutionary mass movement in the past two years has smashed the fierce resistance of the bourgeois reactionary line, overthrown the bourgeois headquarters hidden within our party led by China's Khrushchev, exposed those anti-communist, anti-people, anti-Mao Zedong Thought counter-revolutionary revisionists, those traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionary two-faced characters, and smashed their evil plots to overthrow our proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism. This is the great political victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary masses across the country, while joyfully celebrating this great victory, are filled with profound proletarian feelings of love for the great leader Chairman Mao, and enthusiastically sing the praises of the unparalleled greatness and wisdom of Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principles on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat as proposed in the "Notice." The proletarian revolutionaries, revolutionary masses, and Red Guards in the capital, at the workers' congress, peasants' congress, and the Red Guards' congresses of universities and colleges, as well as in the celebrations held in their respective factories, communes, schools, and institutions, reviewed with revolutionary enthusiasm the battle journey of closely following the great leader Chairman Mao from one victory to another. They said that the past two years of class struggles, one after another, have most eloquently proven that the great leader Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principles on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat are the greatest, wisest, most correct, and most scientific, creatively developing Marxism-Leninism. This has profound and great significance for consolidating our proletarian dictatorship, continuing the socialist revolution, and the international communist movement. All victories, ten thousand victories, are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. All victories are attributed to the great leader Chairman Mao. We will definitely forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, firmly grasp the direction of the revolutionary struggle, and resolutely carry out this political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end, without achieving complete victory, we will not stop fighting.

At the expanded meeting of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee held today, representatives of the revolutionary masses from the Yangpu District Revolutionary Committee, Shanghai Sixth Pharmaceutical Factory, Shanghai No. 17 Textile Mill, Shanghai Port No. 7 District, Huashan Hospital, Tongji University, and other units, discussed and exchanged their experiences and achievements in grasping Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principles on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At the celebratory meeting held by the Tianjin Revolutionary Committee, some "little-known figures" from two years ago took the stage today and shared their victories in defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line together with the broad revolutionary masses. The leader of the Tianjin Revolutionary Committee said at the meeting that in the past two years, in the great struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, the masses, cadres, and revolutionary youngsters have been tempered, learned to grasp Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principles on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat in the practice of struggle, overthrown a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, and cultivated a large number of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao often says, "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, it is revolution. Destruction must be based on reason, and reason is the basis for construction. With destruction as the starting point, construction is also within it." The revolutionary masses across the country, on the occasion of the second anniversary of the issuance of the "Notice," are determined to carry out the revolutionary criticism to the end, clear the ideological path for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions. They pointed out that the revolutionary criticism in the past two years has promoted the unprecedented popularization of Mao Zedong Thought, making the proletarian revolutionaries not only overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party in organization but also overthrow them in politics, ideology, and theory. This is the great ideological victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Many places' revolutionary masses, with their actual actions of launching more powerful revolutionary criticism against a handful of class enemies, celebrated the second anniversary of the issuance of the "Notice." The revolutionary workers of the Anshan Coal Mine, with a glorious revolutionary fighting tradition, sang the praises of the great leader Chairman Mao with their personal experiences and denounced the counter-revolutionary crimes of China's Khrushchev. They said that the "Notice," personally formulated by Chairman Mao, has exposed China's Khrushchev's true colors. As early as the 1920s, China's Khrushchev was an old counter-revolutionary who infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, an agent of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a great traitor who betrayed the interests of the working class. We will definitely use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to expose China's Khrushchev's traitorous face to the public, criticize him deeply and thoroughly, and overthrow and expose him. The revolutionary workers of the Wuhan Enamel Factory, who have been deeply engaged in revolutionary criticism, said that we have grasped the invincible spiritual atomic bomb of Mao Zedong Thought and used the sharp weapon of revolutionary criticism to expose the true colors of China's Khrushchev and his agents, root out a handful of hidden class enemies, and achieved one victory after another. The past two years of intense class struggles have deeply educated us that following the path indicated by the "Notice" is invincible. In the future, we will carry out more in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, thoroughly overthrow and expose a handful of class enemies, and make them never be able to rise again. The poor and lower-middle peasants of the October People's Commune in the suburbs of Nanjing said that under the guidance of the "Notice," we have raised the banner of revolutionary criticism, severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods such as "three selfs and one package" and "four freedoms" pushed by China's Khrushchev in the countryside, consolidated the socialist position in the countryside, and achieved victory after victory in the revolution. Agricultural production has also been bountiful year after year. We will definitely carry out more in-depth revolutionary criticism, eliminate the poison of revisionism, promote production with revolution, and achieve greater harvests.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "'Three-in-one' revolutionary committees are a creation of the working class and the people in this cultural revolution." The great new thing that appeared on the eastern horizon a year ago, the revolutionary committees, are now spread all over the country. They are like bright red flags fluttering in the wind across the motherland. This is the great organizational victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The commemorative activities for the second anniversary of the issuance of the "Notice" across the country were mostly held under the leadership and organization of the newly established revolutionary committees at various levels. The proletarian revolutionaries, broad revolutionary masses, and Red Guards across the country enthusiastically shouted "Long live the revolutionary committees!" and enthusiastically hailed the great victory of the proletarian revolutionaries' struggle for power. The leader of the Hebei Revolutionary Committee said at the commemorative meeting that Hebei Province, like the rest of the country, has a great situation in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with revolutionary committees emerging one after another. Under the leadership and promotion of the revolutionary committees at various levels, Mao Zedong Thought study classes have spread throughout the province, with over 20 million people participating in the study, promoting the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more broadly and deeply across the province, and people's spiritual outlook has undergone tremendous changes. In the revolutionary "three-in-one" temporary power organs, revolutionary cadres have been tempered, and successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause have been cultivated. The proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in Jinan, Nanchang, Xining, Guiyang, and many other places pointed out at the commemorative meetings that the "three-in-one" revolutionary committees are a great creation of the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses in our country armed with Mao Zedong Thought in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary committees have shown strong vitality in leading the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses to continue the struggle against class enemies. We must wholeheartedly support and cherish the revolutionary committees, help them to continuously consolidate and develop, and resolutely smash all the plots of class enemies to overthrow the revolutionary committees. Many members of the revolutionary committees at today's commemorative meetings and symposiums expressed that they would, in the great waves of class struggle, build the revolutionary committees into revolutionary command headquarters that are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang reactionaries and the people it leads, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The proletarian revolutionaries, broad revolutionary masses, and Red Guards across the country, while joyfully commemorating the second anniversary of the issuance of the "Notice," are all filled with confidence and resolutely expressed that they will definitely follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, carry forward the resolute and thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, advance with the momentum of victory, and carry out this political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end, without achieving complete victory, they will not stop fighting!

They expressed that they would definitely, under the guidance of the "Notice," raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, unite and educate the vast majority of cadres and masses, form a mighty revolutionary army, actively, unceasingly, and more powerfully launch attacks on class enemies, carry out more sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism, deeply and thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev and other major capitalist-roaders within the party and their agents politically, ideologically, and theoretically, overthrow and expose them, root out the traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries hidden in dark corners; definitely criticize the bourgeois reactionary thoughts from the right and the "ultra-left," oppose right opportunism, right capitulationism, right splitism, thoroughly smash the rightist reversal wind, consolidate the newly born revolutionary committees; further carry out the "support the army and love the people" movement, strengthen military-civilian unity; definitely pay attention to studying the new problems that arise in the movement, discover and support new revolutionary things, vigorously follow the developing new situation with a revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," redouble efforts, strive for the forefront, "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," and do a better job in all aspects to strive for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The broad cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces are filled with the joy of victory and revolutionary enthusiasm, solemnly commemorating the second anniversary of the issuance of the epoch-making document—the "Notice" of May 16, 1966, personally formulated by the great leader Chairman Mao. They enthusiastically hail the decisive victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the past two years under the guidance of the "Notice." The broad cadres and fighters have deeply felt in the past two years of participating in and defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that the "Notice," shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, is a beacon with brilliant rays for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and continuing the socialist revolution, and it also has profound historical significance for the international communist movement. They firmly expressed that they would definitely better arm themselves with the theory, line, policy, and principles on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat proposed by Chairman Mao in the "Notice," follow the revolutionary course indicated by Chairman Mao, be humble and modest, advance with the momentum of victory, and make new contributions in the great struggle for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The broad cadres and fighters of the various general departments, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, the National Defense Industry Office, various military branches, and the Beijing Garrison, as well as the broad cadres and fighters of the various departments of the People's Liberation Army, held solemn commemorative meetings on the second anniversary of the issuance of the "Notice" personally formulated by Chairman Mao. From the front lines of the East China Sea to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, from the north and south of the Tian Shan Mountains to the Wuzhi Mountains, on the naval docks, air force airfields, and the front lines of "three supports and two militaries," the broad cadres and fighters of the various departments of the entire army held various commemorative activities. The broad cadres and fighters celebrated like a grand festival, filled with profound proletarian feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, waving the red revolutionary treasure book "Quotations from Chairman Mao," enthusiastically shouting "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" The soldiers of the First Company of a certain unit of the Beijing Garrison guarding the Tiananmen Gate performed their own arranged literary and artistic performances at the commemorative meeting, full of passion. In a long poem praising the "Notice," they wrote: "Laughing together from north to south, red flags fluttering over ten thousand mountains and rivers, the second anniversary of the issuance of the 'Notice,' the revolutionary situation is excellent, the surging waves of the heart, raise the battle flag to create new merits." The border defense troops guarding the Awa Mountains in Yunnan and the revolutionary masses in the neighboring areas held a commemorative meeting together and sent a propaganda team to traverse mountains and valleys, visit villages and hamlets, carry out propaganda activities, and talk to the Awa and Lahu ethnic brothers about the epoch-making significance of the "Notice" and the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the past two years under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The cadres and fighters of a certain ship of the Fujian front-line navy, who have been awarded the "Four Good" title for many years and have won merits in defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as well as the cadres and fighters of a certain ship on the front line of the South China Sea, today carried Chairman Mao's giant portrait and the "Notice" to their stations to hold commemorative and study activities with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and fishermen.

The broad cadres and fighters of the Beijing, Jinan, Fuzhou, Kunming, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Chengdu garrisons discussed the great significance of this brilliant Marxist-Leninist historical document at the commemorative meetings, report meetings, and study symposiums held on the second anniversary of the issuance of the "Notice." They unanimously pointed out at the commemorative meetings, report meetings, and study symposiums that the "Notice," personally formulated by Chairman Mao, creatively developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat, is a powerful ideological weapon for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and is the guide to achieving the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Many cadres and fighters of the various departments said in the symposiums that our great leader Chairman Mao recently profoundly pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang reactionaries and the people it leads, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's most profound summary of the great significance and class content of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made us more clearly realize that the handful of major capitalist-roaders within the party represent the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, represent the interests of imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Our struggle with them is a life-and-death struggle, a great revolution of one class overthrowing another. The brilliant "Notice" has made our eyes clearer, exposing one by one the class enemies who were hidden very deeply. This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

The broad cadres and fighters of the Shenyang, Nanjing, Lanzhou garrisons, and the Xinjiang and Tibet Military Regions, while hailing the second anniversary of the issuance of the "Notice," reviewed the brilliant battle journey of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The former political instructor of the "Eighth Company on Nanjing Road," Liu Renfu, said excitedly: This unprecedented political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes has mobilized the hundreds of millions of military and civilian people across the country, everyone cares about national affairs, everyone cares about consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. Whether it is old soldiers or newly enlisted soldiers, two viewpoints have been firmly established, one is unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, defending the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin with one's life, and the other is resolutely defending the proletarian political power. Many cadres and fighters who have fought side by side with the proletarian revolutionaries in the "three supports and two militaries" deeply felt that the brilliant "Notice" has guided us to firmly support the broad leftist masses, seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, and sweep them into the dustbin of history. The "three-in-one" revolutionary committees born in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are the rich fruits of the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses' struggle to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party from the bottom up. It has greatly enriched and developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state. The cadres and fighters working in the mountainous areas and those executing the "three supports and two militaries" tasks in the Hainan region excitedly said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the past two years has pushed the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to an unprecedented new high, people's class struggle and line struggle awareness have never been as high as today, the effect of breaking private interests and establishing public interests has never been as good as today, people's spiritual outlook has undergone tremendous changes, and a large number of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought have emerged in the struggle.

The broad cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, while hailing the second anniversary of the issuance of the "Notice," unanimously expressed that they would further study the "Notice," better grasp Chairman Mao's theory on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and make greater contributions in the great struggle for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The "three supports and two militaries" personnel and revolutionary masses of the Zhangjiakou garrison, together with the "Notice" as a guide, summarized the revolutionary struggle experience of the past two years, determined to advance with the momentum of victory, and carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. The cadres and fighters guarding the front line of the South China Sea's Wanshan Islands held a swearing-in ceremony in front of the monument to revolutionary martyrs, determined to follow the example of revolutionary martyrs, devote all their strength to defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the national sea defense. The broad cadres and fighters on the front lines of the "three supports and two militaries" all expressed that, in the great revolutionary situation, they would definitely remember Chairman Mao's great teachings of "never forgetting class struggle," together with the revolutionary masses, grasp the new trends, new characteristics, and new problems of class struggle, firmly grasp the direction of struggle, continue to launch attacks on a handful of class enemies, resolutely oppose right opportunism, right capitulationism, right splitism, thoroughly smash the rightist reversal wind, carry out more in-depth revolutionary criticism, grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, promote preparedness, and do a better job in all aspects to strive for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    在伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的划时代文献《通知》的光辉照耀下，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，人类历史上没有先例的无产阶级文化大革命，在两年中已经取得了决定性的胜利。在无产阶级革命斗争史中创立了不朽功勋的我国无产阶级革命派、亿万革命群众和红卫兵小将，回顾两年来在伟大领袖毛主席统率下走过的战斗历程，重温了《通知》这个伟大的历史文件，决心在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导下，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着《通知》指引的道路，朝气蓬勃地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，发扬无产阶级的坚决彻底革命精神，向阶级敌人发动更加猛烈的进攻，乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
    五月十六日，在北京、上海、天津等大城市，在河北、山西、内蒙古、黑龙江、吉林、辽宁、山东、安徽、江苏、浙江、江西、河南、湖北、湖南、广东、广西、陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海、贵州、四川、福建、云南、新疆、西藏等各省省会和自治区首府，在各地广大城乡，许多工厂、企业、机关、学校和农村人民公社，纷纷举行各种活动，隆重纪念《通知》发表两周年。许多地方举行了有几万人到几十万人参加的规模盛大的集会。许多省、市、自治区的革命委员会和驻军负责同志，出席了当地的纪念大会，并且讲了话。在各地的纪念集会上，人们千遍万遍地高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想胜利万岁！”“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利万岁！”“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    在各地的纪念活动中，广大革命群众热烈地赞颂说，在毛主席亲自主持制定的《通知》的鼓舞下，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，两年来规模空前巨大的革命群众运动，粉碎了资产阶级反动路线的重重抵抗，冲垮了隐藏在我们党内以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，把那些反共、反人民、反毛泽东思想的反革命修正主义分子，把那些叛徒、特务、反革命两面派冲刷了出来，粉碎了他们妄图颠覆我国无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，这是无产阶级文化大革命在政治上的伟大胜利。各地革命群众在欢欣鼓舞地庆祝这个伟大胜利的时候，都怀着无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，热烈歌颂毛主席在《通知》中提出的无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策的无比英明伟大。首都无产阶级革命派、革命群众和红卫兵小将，在工代会、农代会和大、中学校红代会隆重举行的集会上，在自己所在的工厂、公社、学校和机关举行的庆祝活动中，满怀革命豪情，回顾了紧跟伟大领袖毛主席从一个胜利走向又一个胜利的战斗历程。他们说，两年来一场又一场惊心动魄的阶级大搏斗，最雄辩地证明，伟大领袖毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针和政策最伟大、最英明、最正确、最科学，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，这对巩固我国无产阶级专政，继续进行社会主义革命，对于国际共产主义运动，都有深远的伟大意义。千胜利，万胜利，一切胜利都是毛泽东思想和毛主席无产阶级革命路线的胜利，一切胜利都归功于伟大领袖毛主席。我们一定永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，牢牢掌握革命斗争大方向，坚决把这场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底，不获全胜，决不收兵。在上海市革命委员会今天举行的扩大会议上，杨浦区革命委员会、上海第六制药厂、国棉十七厂、上港七区、华山医院、同济大学等单位的革命群众代表，畅谈和交流了掌握毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，进行无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大成绩和体会。在天津市革命委员会举行的庆祝大会上，两年前一些不出名的“小人物”，今天走上讲坛，畅谈了他们和广大革命群众一起，坚持和保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线所取得的胜利。天津市革命委员会负责同志在大会上说，两年来，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗中，锻炼了群众，锻炼了干部，锻炼了革命小将，使他们在斗争的实践中学会掌握毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，打倒了党内一小撮走资派，培养了一大批用毛泽东思想武装的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    毛主席经常说，不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。各地革命群众在纪念《通知》发表两周年的时候，决心把革命大批判进行到底，为无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利从思想上扫清道路，让毛泽东思想永远占领一切阵地。他们指出，两年来的革命大批判，促进了毛泽东思想的空前大普及，使无产阶级革命派不仅在组织上把党内一小撮走资派打倒，而且在政治上、思想上、理论上把他们打倒，这是无产阶级文化大革命在思想上取得的伟大胜利。许多地方的革命群众，以对一小撮阶级敌人展开更加猛烈的革命大批判的实际行动，庆祝《通知》发表两周年。富有光荣革命斗争传统的安源煤矿的广大革命职工，以自己的亲身经历，热烈歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命罪行。他们说，毛主席亲自主持制定的《通知》，揭穿了中国赫鲁晓夫的画皮。早在二十年代，中国赫鲁晓夫，就是一个混进革命队伍里的老反革命，就是国民党反动派的代理人，就是出卖工人阶级利益的大叛徒。我们一定以毛泽东思想为武器，把中国赫鲁晓夫的叛徒嘴脸拿出来示众，把他批深批透，斗倒斗臭。一直坚持深入开展革命大批判的武汉搪瓷厂的革命职工说，我们掌握了毛泽东思想这个威力无比的精神原子弹，运用革命大批判这个锐利武器，揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的原形，揪出了一小撮暗藏的阶级敌人，取得了一个又一个胜利。两年来惊心动魄的阶级斗争深深地教育我们，沿着《通知》指引的道路走，就无往而不胜。今后我们要更加深入持久地开展革命大批判，把一小撮阶级敌人彻底斗倒斗臭，让他们永世不得翻身。南京市郊十月人民公社的贫下中农说，我们在《通知》的光辉照耀下，高举革命大批判的旗帜，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在农村推行的“三自一包”、“四大自由”等反革命修正主义黑货，巩固了农村社会主义阵地，革命节节胜利，农业生产也连年丰收。我们一定要更深入地开展革命的大批判，肃清修正主义流毒，以革命带动生产，夺取更大的丰收。
    毛主席指出：“‘三结合’的革命委员会，是工人阶级和人民群众在这次文化大革命中的一种创造。”一年前出现在东方地平线上的伟大新事物革命委员会，目前已经遍布全国各地。它们象一面面鲜艳的红旗，在祖国大地上迎风招展。这是无产阶级文化大革命在组织上取得的伟大胜利。各地庆祝《通知》发表两周年的活动，大都是在各级新生的革命委员会的领导和主持下进行的。各地无产阶级革命派、广大革命群众和红卫兵小将，在庆祝集会上热烈欢呼“革命委员会好”，热烈欢呼无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的伟大胜利。河北省革命委员会负责同志在庆祝大会上说，河北省和全国一样，无产阶级文化大革命形势一片大好，革命委员会联翩出现。在各级革命委员会的领导和推动下，毛泽东思想学习班遍及全省城乡，参加学习的人数达到两千多万人，推动全省活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动更加广泛深入地开展，人们的精神面貌发生了巨大的变化。在革命“三结合”的临时权力机构中，锻炼了革命干部，培养了无产阶级革命事业的接班人。济南、南昌、西宁、贵阳等许多地方的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在庆祝集会上指出，“三结合”的革命委员会，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国亿万革命群众，在无产阶级文化大革命中的伟大创造。革命委员会在领导无产阶级革命派和革命群众继续向阶级敌人进攻的斗争中，显示了强大的生命力。我们一定要满腔热情地支持和爱护革命委员会，帮助它不断地巩固和发展，坚决粉碎阶级敌人妄图颠覆革命委员会的一切阴谋。许多地方的革命委员会成员，在今天的庆祝集会和座谈会上表示，要在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，把革命委员会建设成为永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的革命战斗指挥部。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”全国无产阶级革命派、广大革命群众和红卫兵小将，在欢欣鼓舞地纪念《通知》发表两周年的时候，都充满信心地坚决表示，一定要遵循毛主席的伟大教导，发扬无产阶级的坚决彻底革命精神，乘胜前进，把这场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底，不获全胜，决不收兵！

    新华社十六日讯　人民解放军陆海空三军广大指战员，满怀胜利的喜悦和革命豪情，隆重纪念伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的划时代文献——中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》发表两周年，热烈地欢呼在《通知》的光辉照耀下，两年来无产阶级文化大革命取得的决定性胜利。广大指战员在两年来参加和保卫无产阶级文化大革命的斗争中越来越深刻地体会到，闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的《通知》，是巩固无产阶级专政，继续进行社会主义革命的光芒万丈的灯塔，对于国际共产主义运动也具有深远的历史作用。他们坚定地表示，一定要更好地用毛主席在《通知》中提出的无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，把自己武装起来，沿着毛主席指引的革命航向，戒骄戒躁，乘胜前进，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中立新功。
    人民解放军各总部、国防科委、国防工办、各军种、兵种领导机关以及北京部队广大指战员，在毛主席亲自主持制定的《通知》发表两周年的时候，分别隆重举行了庆祝集会。从东海前哨到西藏高原，从天山南北到五指山下，在海军码头、空军机场，在“三支”“两军”第一线上，全军各部队广大指战员纷纷集会，举行各种庆祝活动。广大指战员象过盛大节日一样，怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚的无产阶级感情，挥动红彤彤的革命宝书《毛主席语录》，纵情高呼“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”守卫在天安门的北京卫戍区某部一连战士，在庆祝会上，充满激情地演出了自己编排的文艺节目。他们在一首赞颂《通知》的长诗中写道：山南海北齐欢笑，万里山河红旗飘，《通知》发表两周年，革命形势无限好，心潮激起千层浪，高举战旗创建新功劳。守卫在云南阿佤山区的边防部队指战员，和驻地附近的兄弟民族革命群众一起举行庆祝会，并派出宣传队，跋山涉水，走村串寨，开展宣传活动，向佤族、拉祜族兄弟大讲《通知》的划时代意义，大摆两年来在毛主席革命路线的指引下无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。连年被评为“四好艇”、在保卫无产阶级文化大革命中荣立战功的福建前线海军某艇指战员，以及正在南海前线执行任务的某艇指战员，今天抬着毛主席巨幅画像，带着《通知》到驻地同广大贫下中农和渔民一起举行庆祝和学习活动。
    北京、济南、福州、昆明、广州、武汉、成都等部队广大指战员，在庆祝《通知》发表两周年时，畅谈了这一光辉的马克思列宁主义的历史文件的伟大意义。他们在庆祝会、报告会、学习座谈会上一致指出，毛主席亲自主持制定的《通知》，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义无产阶级专政学说，是在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的强大思想武器，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的指南。许多部队的指战员们在座谈中说，我们伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席对无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义和阶级内容所作的这一最深刻的概括，使我们更加清楚地认识到，党内一小撮最大的走资派就是代表国民党反动派利益，代表帝国主义、资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右利益的反革命黑帮。我们同他们的斗争，是一场你死我活的斗争，是一个阶级推翻另一个阶级的大革命。光辉的《通知》使我们擦亮了眼睛，把那些隐藏得很深的阶级敌人，一个一个地挖了出来，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    沈阳、南京、兰州部队以及新疆、西藏军区广大指战员，在欢呼《通知》发表两周年时，回顾了无产阶级文化大革命的光辉的战斗历程。“南京路上好八连”前任政治指导员刘仁福激动地说：这场史无前例的无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，把全国亿万军民都发动起来了，人人关心国家大事，人人关心巩固无产阶级专政。不论是老战士，还是刚入伍的新战士，有两个观点树立得最牢固，一个是无限忠于毛主席，誓死捍卫以毛主席为首的、以林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，一个是坚决地捍卫无产阶级政权。许多在“三支”“两军”中同无产阶级革命派并肩战斗的指战员深有体会地说，光辉的《通知》，指引着我们坚定不移地支持左派广大群众，向党内一小撮走资派夺权，把他们扫进历史的垃圾堆。在无产阶级文化大革命中诞生的“三结合”革命委员会，是无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众对党内一小撮走资派进行自下而上的夺权斗争的丰硕成果，它大大丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义的国家学说。正在山区施工的铁道兵某部指战员和在海南地区执行“三支”“两军”任务的指战员兴奋地说，两年来的无产阶级文化大革命，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向前所未有的新高潮，人们阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟从来没有象今天这样高，破私立公的效果从来没有象今天这样好，人的精神面貌发生了巨大的变化，用毛泽东思想哺育起来的无产阶级革命事业接班人在斗争中大量涌现。
    解放军广大指战员在欢呼《通知》发表两周年时，一致表示，要进一步学好《通知》，更好地掌握毛主席关于无产阶级专政下进行革命的理论，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中作出更大贡献。张家口驻军“三支”“两军”人员和革命群众一起，以《通知》为指针，总结两年来的革命斗争经验，决心乘胜前进，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。守卫在南海前哨万山群岛某部指战员，在革命烈士的纪念碑前举行誓师大会，决心以革命烈士为榜样，为保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫祖国的海防贡献自己的一切力量。战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的广大指战员纷纷表示，在革命的大好形势下，一定牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，同革命群众一起，掌握阶级斗争的新动向、新特点、新问题，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，向一小撮阶级敌人继续发动进攻，坚决反对右倾机会主义，右倾投降主义，右倾分裂主义，彻底粉碎右倾翻案妖风，更加深入地开展革命的大批判，抓革命、促生产、促工作、促战备，把各方面的工作做得好上加好，为全面地完成人类历史上第一次无产阶级文化大革命的历史任务而努力奋斗！
