We must advocate for revolutionary, combative, and mass-oriented literary criticism. We must break the monopoly of a few so-called "literary critics" (those whose direction is wrong and whose criticism is weak and ineffective) over literary criticism. We must hand the weapon of literary criticism over to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, so that professional critics and mass critics can work together.

    要提倡革命的战斗的群众性的文艺批评，打破少数所谓“文艺批评家”（即方向错误的和软弱无力的那些批评家）对文艺批评的垄断，把文艺批评的武器交给广大工农兵群众去掌握，使专门批评家和群众批评家结合起来。
