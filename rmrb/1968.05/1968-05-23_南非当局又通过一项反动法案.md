The South African authorities, backed by imperialist powers such as the United States and Britain, have recently passed another reactionary law. This law aims to politically strengthen the evil apartheid system that the South African apartheid regime of Vorster is implementing.

According to reports, the South African parliament, controlled by racists, passed a reactionary law on May 1st, despite the opposition of the South African people. This law stipulates that no political organization in South Africa can have members of multiple races, and declares that political contact between different races is "illegal." It also stipulates that violators will be fined or imprisoned.

    南非当局又通过一项反动法案
    得到美英等帝国主义支持的南非沃斯特种族主义政权，最近又通过了一项反动法案，企图从政治上强化它在南非推行的罪恶的种族隔离制度。
    据报道，南非种族主义者控制的“议会”，不顾南非人民的反对，五月一日通过了一项反动法案，规定南非任何政治组织不得拥有多种族的成员，并宣布不同种族的人进行政治接触是“非法的”。它还规定，违反者将罚款或判刑。
