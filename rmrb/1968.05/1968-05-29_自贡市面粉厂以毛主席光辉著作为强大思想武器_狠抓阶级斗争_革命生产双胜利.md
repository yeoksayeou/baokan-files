The workers of the Selfong Flour Mill in Sichuan Province, under the leadership of the revolutionary committee of the mill, have continuously and fiercely grasped class struggle, promoted production, and achieved dual victories in revolution and production by using Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" as a powerful ideological weapon. After fully and over-fulfilling the state plan in the first quarter of this year, the mill also over-fulfilled the plan in April.

Since the revolutionary committee of the mill was established in January this year, it has always attached great importance to class struggle. In March, the mill was rated as an advanced collective in the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the city's industrial system, and many units of revolutionary rebels came to learn from their advanced experience. Amidst the praise, a few revolutionary workers in the mill began to harbor feelings of pride and complacency, and their vigilance against the sabotage and disruption by class enemies was not as high. In response to this situation, the revolutionary committee of the mill organized all revolutionary workers in the mill to study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" again. The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Is it to carry the revolution through to the end or to let the revolution stop halfway? If we are to carry the revolution through to the end, we must use revolutionary methods to thoroughly, completely, and resolutely wipe out all reactionary forces. ... If we are to let the revolution stop halfway, we will be going against the will of the people and accepting the will of the foreign aggressors and the Chinese reactionaries, giving the Kuomintang the opportunity to recover and then, one fine morning, pouncing upon us and strangling the revolution, plunging the whole country back into darkness." Chairman Mao's teachings illuminated the hearts of the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat. They seriously analyzed the class struggle situation in their mill, fully mobilized the masses, exposed the conspiracy activities of the capitalist roaders within the Party who used various despicable means to try to reverse their verdicts, and the living facts of class struggle, which greatly educated the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat and revolutionary workers. They launched a more fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, making the revolution and production in the entire mill even more fiery. Some revolutionary workers repaired old lathes that had been idle for many years and put them back into production, saving the state a large amount of funds.

The revolutionary rebels of the proletariat and the revolutionary masses in this mill have always used Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" as a great driving force to promote the revolution in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At every critical moment of the revolution, they have seriously studied this brilliant work of Chairman Mao and other works. All the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat and revolutionary workers in the mill have vowed to plant the thought of carrying the revolution through to the end deeply in their minds and put it into practice, to be thorough revolutionaries of the proletariat.

    自贡市面粉厂以毛主席光辉著作为强大思想武器
    狠抓阶级斗争  革命生产双胜利
    新华社成都二十八日电　四川自贡市面粉厂的广大革命职工，以毛主席光辉著作《将革命进行到底》为强大思想武器，在厂革命委员会的领导下不间断地狠抓阶级斗争，猛促生产，革命和生产获得了双胜利。这个厂继今年第一季度全面超额完成国家计划之后，四月份又超额完成了计划。
    这个厂今年一月成立革命委员会后，一直很重视抓阶级斗争。三月间这个厂被评为全市工业系统活学活用毛主席著作的先进集体，许多单位的无产阶级革命派都来学习他们的先进经验。在一片赞扬声中，厂里少数革命职工开始滋长了骄傲自满情绪，对阶级敌人的破坏和捣乱的警惕性不是那么高了。针对这种情况，厂革委会就组织全厂革命职工再一次认真学习毛主席的光辉著作《将革命进行到底》。伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“是将革命进行到底呢，还是使革命半途而废呢？如果要使革命进行到底，那就是用革命的方法，坚决彻底干净全部地消灭一切反动势力，……。如果要使革命半途而废，那就是违背人民的意志，接受外国侵略者和中国反动派的意志，使国民党赢得养好创伤的机会，然后在一个早上猛扑过来，将革命扼死，使全国回到黑暗世界。”毛主席的教导，照亮了无产阶级革命派的心。他们认真分析了本厂阶级斗争的形势，经过充分发动群众，揭露了党内走资派采取各种卑鄙手段，妄图为自己翻案的阴谋活动，活生生的阶级斗争事实，使得无产阶级革命派和革命职工受到很大教育。他们向一小撮阶级敌人发动了更加猛烈的进攻，把全厂革命和生产搞得更加热火朝天。有的革命工人将多年搁置的坏车床重新修复投入生产，为国家节约了一大笔资金。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，一直把毛主席的光辉著作《将革命进行到底》作为推进革命的巨大动力。在革命的每一个紧要关头，他们都认真学习毛主席的这篇光辉著作和其他著作。全厂无产阶级革命派和革命职工誓把将革命进行到底的思想永远扎根在脑子里，落实在行动上，做彻底的无产阶级革命派。
