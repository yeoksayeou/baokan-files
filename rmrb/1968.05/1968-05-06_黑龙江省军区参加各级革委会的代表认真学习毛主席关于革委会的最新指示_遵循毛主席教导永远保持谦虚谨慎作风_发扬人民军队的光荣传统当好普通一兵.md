Representatives of the Heilongjiang Military Region participating in various levels of revolutionary committees have been diligently studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary committees. They follow Chairman Mao's teachings to always maintain a humble and cautious attitude, carry forward the glorious traditions of the people's army, and strive to be ordinary soldiers.

Higher and higher we hold aloft the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, and vigorously carry out our own ideological revolutionization. We broadly solicit the opinions and criticisms of the masses, place ourselves under the supervision of the masses, and willingly be the students of the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, May 5th - During the Heilongjiang Province's Second Conference of Active Learners and Appliers of Mao Zedong Thought, military representatives participating in local revolutionary committees at various levels in Heilongjiang Province have diligently studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary committees. They have also discussed how to further advance their own ideological revolutionization. Everyone unanimously agreed that the ideological revolutionization of military representatives participating in the "three-in-one combination" of the revolutionary committees faces a new challenge: to hold aloft the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, maintain humility and caution, guard against arrogance and impatience, continue to carry forward the glorious traditions of our army's close ties with the masses and frugality, and strive to be ordinary soldiers and students of the masses.

Recently, Chairman Mao taught us: "The basic experience of revolutionary committees has three points: one is the presence of revolutionary cadre representatives, one is the presence of military representatives, and one is the presence of revolutionary mass representatives, achieving the 'three-in-one combination' of the revolution. Revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative structures, streamline and reduce bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary, mass-linked leadership team." The representatives deeply felt from their practice that Chairman Mao's teachings not only summarize the experiences of revolutionary committees at various levels, pointing out the fundamental direction for the construction of revolutionary committees, but also point out the fundamental direction for military representatives participating in the "three-in-one combination" to advance their own ideological revolutionization.

The representatives participating in the discussion pointed out that after the establishment of the revolutionary committees, the first test faced by the military representatives was that in the early stages, due to the masses' trust in the People's Liberation Army, they were willing to turn to military representatives for solutions to all kinds of problems. In this situation, how military representatives continue to maintain a humble and cautious attitude, willingly be students of the masses, and inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of our army's close ties with the masses is a matter that deserves serious attention.

Chairman Mao taught us: "We communists are not here to be officials, but to make revolution. We must all have a thorough spirit of revolution. We must never, even for a moment, be separated from the masses." The masses are the creators of history, the true heroes. Everyone believes that maintaining close ties with the masses, striving to be ordinary soldiers and students of the masses, "is the sure guarantee for communists to avoid bureaucratism, prevent revisionism and dogmatism, and stand unshakable." If we are separated from the masses, the revolutionary committees will lose their foundation, and the military representatives in the revolutionary committees will also be the same. Everyone, in connection with the lessons of some cadres' mistakes, realized that whether or not to maintain close ties with the masses, to be students of the masses, is not a matter of general work style or work methods, but a fundamental issue of stance, a major issue of which line to follow. Military representatives participating in the revolutionary committees must vigorously carry out their own ideological revolutionization, never be separated from the masses, and always maintain a humble and cautious, unarrogant, and unimpudent attitude. They must carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution. They must regard maintaining close ties with the masses, striving to be ordinary soldiers and students of the masses, as an important indicator of their loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They must ensure that no matter how much things change, the relationship of flesh and blood with the masses will never change, and the spirit of willingly being students of the masses will never change. Only in this way can they successfully complete the glorious mission entrusted to the People's Liberation Army by the great leader Chairman Mao, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and carry out this political revolution under socialist conditions to the end.

During the discussion, everyone felt that with the change in status, the work environment and conditions have also undergone new changes. How to deal with these conditions is a new test. The representatives believe that in the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the class enemies want to restore capitalism. In addition to political attacks, they always try to open up our weaknesses from the living aspect and use sugar-coated bullets to corrupt us. Therefore, hard work is a requirement of class struggle, a requirement of maintaining close ties with the masses, and also a symbol of ideological revolutionization. For proletarian revolutionaries, at any time, we must remember the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, carry forward the glorious tradition of hard work, and always maintain the closest ties with the masses, forever revolutionary, and never change. The meeting introduced many vivid examples of military representatives at various levels of revolutionary committees maintaining and carrying forward the hard-working spirit, which received everyone's attention.

In the discussion, the representatives also pointed out deeply that to make the newly born revolutionary committees develop and consolidate, we must actively create conditions to place ourselves under the supervision of the masses. The Zhaozhou County Revolutionary Committee was the first county-level revolutionary committee established in Heilongjiang Province. They created good experiences in seizing power and holding power, and had prestige in the hearts of the masses. At this time, some people had the thought of "good enough." They held several mass consultation meetings in response to this active thought, and formed four propaganda teams to go deep into the grassroots, solicit the opinions of the masses, listen to the criticisms of the masses, and found many places where they were "far from good enough," giving everyone a vivid lesson. They felt that the higher the prestige of the revolutionary committees, the greater the hope the masses have for the revolutionary committees, and the stricter the requirements for the ideological revolutionization of every member of the revolutionary committees. At this time, the members of the revolutionary committees must pay more attention to maintaining close ties with the masses and placing themselves under the supervision of the masses, willingly being students of the masses.

The representatives unanimously agreed in the discussion that to let the masses supervise oneself, one must actively create conditions for the masses. Many military representatives have brought the practice of the army regularly holding soldiers' meetings into the revolutionary committees, regularly holding "democratic meetings," both inside and outside the revolutionary committees, both above and below, broadly soliciting the opinions and criticisms of the masses. They follow Chairman Mao's instructions: "In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots from time to time, see for themselves, and adhere to the mass line. When encountering things, they should consult with the masses more and be students of the masses," often going to the workers, going to the poor and lower-middle peasants, eating, living, working, studying Chairman Mao's works, and criticizing and repudiating revisionism together with the masses, so that the masses can better understand themselves, help themselves, and promote their own ideological revolutionization.

　　黑龙江省军区参加各级革委会的代表认真学习毛主席关于革委会的最新指示
　　遵循毛主席教导永远保持谦虚谨慎作风
　　发扬人民军队的光荣传统当好普通一兵
    更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓自身的思想革命化，广泛听取群众的意见和批评，把自己置于群众的监督之下，甘当群众的小学生
    新华社哈尔滨五日电　人民解放军黑龙江省军区参加地方各级革命委员会的军队代表，在出席黑龙江省第二次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会期间，认真学习了毛主席关于革命委员会的最新指示，并且对如何进一步搞好思想革命化的问题进行了座谈。大家一致认为，参加革命委员会的军队代表，思想革命化面临的一个新课题，就是要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，继续发扬我军密切联系群众和艰苦朴素的光荣传统，当好普通一兵，当好群众的小学生。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”代表们从实践中深刻地体会到，毛主席的这一教导，不仅总结了各级革命委员会的经验，指出了革命委员会建设的根本方向，也为参加革命“三结合”的军队代表搞好思想革命化指出了根本方向。
    参加座谈会的代表们指出，部队同志参加革命委员会后，首先遇到的一个考验，就是革委会成立初期，由于群众信赖解放军，什么事都愿意找军队代表解决。在这种情况下，军队代表怎样继续保持谦虚谨慎的作风，甘当群众的小学生，同时继承和发扬我军密切联系群众的光荣传统，是一个十分值得注意的问题。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。”人民群众是历史的创造者，是真正的英雄。大家认为，密切联系群众，当好普通一兵，甘当群众的小学生，“是使共产党人免除官僚主义、避免修正主义和教条主义，永远立于不败之地的确实保证”。脱离了群众，革命委员会就失去了基础，革委会中的军队代表也同样如此。大家联系有些干部犯错误的教训，认识到：能否密切联系群众，当群众的小学生，绝不是一般的工作作风问题，工作方法问题，而是根本立场问题，是执行什么路线的大问题。参加革委会的军队代表，只有狠抓自身的思想革命化，一时一刻也不脱离群众，永远保持谦虚谨慎、不骄不躁的作风，发扬不断革命的精神。一定要把密切联系群众，当好普通一兵，当好群众的小学生，看作是检验自己忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的重要标志，做到千变万变，同群众血肉相连的关系永远不变，甘当群众小学生的精神永远不变。只有这样，才能圆满完成伟大领袖毛主席交给人民解放军的光荣任务，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把社会主义条件下的这场政治大革命进行到底。
    座谈中，大家感到，随着地位的变化，工作环境和条件也有了新的变化，如何对待这些条件，也是一个新的考验。代表们认为，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，阶级敌人要搞资本主义复辟，除了政治上的进攻之外，总是企图从生活上打开我们的缺口，用糖衣炮弹来腐蚀我们。因此，艰苦奋斗是阶级斗争的需要，是密切联系群众的需要，也是实现思想革命化的标志。对于无产阶级革命者说来，任何时候都要牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导，发扬艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，使自己永远同群众保持最密切的联系，永远革命，永不变质。会上介绍了各级革命委员会的军队代表保持和发扬艰苦奋斗作风的许多生动事例，受到了大家的重视。
    在座谈中，代表们还深刻地指出，要使新生的革命委员会不断发展和巩固，还要积极创造条件，把自己置于群众的监督之下。肇州县革命委员会是黑龙江省第一个建立起来的县一级的革命委员会。他们在夺权和掌权方面创造了很好的经验，在群众心目中有了威望。这时，有人产生了“差不多”的思想，他们就针对这种活思想，连续召开几次群众座谈会，并组成四个宣传队深入基层，征求群众意见，听取群众批评，找到了不少“差得多”的地方，使大家受到了一次生动的教育。他们体会到，革命委员会的威望越高，说明群众对革命委员会寄予的希望越大，对革命委员会每个成员的思想革命化要求越严，这时，革委会的成员就越要注意密切联系群众，把自己置于群众的监督之下，甘当群众的小学生。
    代表们在座谈中一致认为，要让群众监督自己，就必须为群众积极创造条件。许多军队代表都把部队定期召开军人大会的作法，带进了革命委员会，定期召开“民主会”，在革委会内部开，也在革委会外部开，在上面开，也在基层开，广泛听取群众的意见和批评。他们遵照毛主席“以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生”的教导，经常到工人中去，到贫下中农中去，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习毛主席著作、同斗私批修，使群众更好地了解自己，帮助自己，促进自己的思想革命化。
