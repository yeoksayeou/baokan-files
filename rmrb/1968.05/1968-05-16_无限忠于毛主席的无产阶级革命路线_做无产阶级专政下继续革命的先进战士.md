Edition: 2

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our entire platoon responded enthusiastically to Vice Chairman Lin's call to raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. We closely linked this with the actual struggle between the two lines, studying and applying Chairman Mao's theories, lines, policies, methods, and guidelines on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Like our excellent platoon leader Li Wenzhong, we hold one word "loyalty" in our hearts for our great teacher, Chairman Mao, and grasp one word "application" for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We resolutely implement and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, striving to be advanced elements in continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	Chairman Mao's Proletarian Revolutionary Line
	Is the Soul of Revolutionary Soldiers
Our pledge is: "To fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in life, and to die for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in death!"

Vice Chairman Lin pointed out: "The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very important issue. We must grasp the issue of attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought." The attitude of revolutionary soldiers towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is concentrated in one shining word: "loyalty." All of us in the platoon consciously take "loyalty" as the standard for transforming our souls. "Chairman Mao loves me, I love Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao supports me, I support Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao instructs me, I act accordingly; Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance!" In short: "To fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in life, and to die for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in death!" This is our firm pledge of loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

How have we forged our loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line?

We grasp class education firmly, building our unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on a deep foundation of proletarian feelings. In the summer of 1966, the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, led by China's Khrushchev, frantically pushed the capitalist reactionary line, attempting to suppress the great and magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao. We saw this with our own eyes and hated it in our hearts. Soon, the great leader Chairman Mao personally directed the formulation of the "Sixteen Points." Platoon Leader Li Wenzhong was so moved that tears welled up in his eyes as he read it aloud to us twice. He said passionately, "Comrades, the 'Sixteen Points' is the program of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It signifies the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the complete bankruptcy of the capitalist reactionary line." To inspire everyone's boundless proletarian love for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, Platoon Leader Li Wenzhong led the entire platoon to visit the poor and ask about their hardships, even eating a "bitter meal" at an old peasant's home. During the meal, the old man and woman shed tears recalling the bitterness of the old society and spoke with smiles about the sweetness of today. Comrades linked the bitterness of the past to condemn the heinous crimes of the capitalist reactionary line and linked the sweetness of today to praise the correctness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Comrades deeply understood that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the correct line for the laboring people to rise up and seek liberation, the lifeline of the victory of the proletarian revolution. This aroused in everyone a deep proletarian love for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Everyone swore to Chairman Mao: "To fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in life, and to die for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in death!"

We seriously study Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, deeply understanding that unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the first need of the times and the first need of the revolution. Whenever the great leader Chairman Mao issues a new instruction, we ensure it is promptly conveyed, deeply studied, thoroughly understood, and immediately acted upon, step by step. Comrades say: "Though we are thousands of miles away from Beijing, we are never separated from Chairman Mao." When the joyous news of Chairman Mao's first reception of the Red Guards reached the unit, Platoon Leader Li Wenzhong enthusiastically told everyone, "Comrades, the great leader Chairman Mao supports and loves the Red Guards. Chairman Mao supports, we support; Chairman Mao loves, we love. The Red Guard movement is excellent!" That night, our entire platoon wrote letters to our relatives, expressing great political enthusiasm to praise and support all revolutionary actions of the Red Guard youths.

We closely link the actual struggle between the two lines, studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, forging our red-hearted loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We resolutely carry out Vice Chairman Lin's instruction to study Mao Zedong Thought by "focusing on the word 'application'." We study and then apply, turning Chairman Mao's every new instruction into conscious action. Last August 18th in the evening, after Platoon Leader Li Wenzhong mobilized us to escort the Red Guards, everyone wrote a pledge. Comrade Li Congquan said, "Chairman Mao's great instruction to 'protect the leftists' is my pledge!" He neatly wrote down Chairman Mao's teachings in his notebook: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and works thoroughly for the people's interests. 'Our responsibility is to the people.'" The next day, at the critical moment of rescuing Red Guards in the rapid currents of the Gan River, he braved the waves, disregarding his own life, holding a small wooden plank, and rescued three Red Guards in succession. When he was exhausted, seeing a few revolutionary youths in danger, he quickly pushed the plank towards the revolutionary youths with the spirit of "completely, thoroughly, and responsibility to the people," while he himself sacrificed his young life, fulfilling his grand pledge: "To fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in life, and to die for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in death."

	Chairman Mao's Proletarian Revolutionary Line
	Is the Code of Conduct for Revolutionary Soldiers
Our pledge is: "To keep the string of the struggle between the two lines in our minds taut at all times!"

Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is either the east wind prevailing over the west wind, or the west wind prevailing over the east wind. There is no room for compromise on the issue of line." In the struggle between the two lines, you are either on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line or on the side of the capitalist reactionary line. We must continually raise our awareness of the struggle between the two lines, keeping the string of the struggle between the two lines taut at all times. Only in this way can we see clearly, stand firmly, and withstand the test in the sharp and complex class struggle, consciously implementing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Keeping the string of the struggle between the two lines taut makes us clear-sighted and identifies the enemy. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." After China's Khrushchev was exposed, our entire platoon immediately reviewed the "Sixteen Points" formulated under Chairman Mao's personal direction, using the perspective of the struggle between the two lines to deeply expose and criticize China's Khrushchev's various crimes of pushing the capitalist reactionary line in 1962 by promoting individual farming, in 1964 by feigning leftism while acting rightist, and during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Everyone further deeply understood that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the red thread that carries the Chinese revolution and world revolution to the end, the golden bridge from socialism to communism. While China's Khrushchev's capitalist reactionary line is the black thread of restoring capitalism. China's Khrushchev is the representative of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, the most dangerous and principal enemy. The entire platoon indignantly declared: "Unless we overthrow and expose the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party led by China's Khrushchev and eliminate all harmful creatures in the world, we will not rest in peace." We are determined to think for defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, use our strength for defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and shed our blood for defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, "Cutting off my head is nothing, as long as my principles are true, defending Chairman Mao, I am willing to die." Soon, during our "three supports, two militaries" mission in Jiangxi, harboring deep hatred for China's Khrushchev, we firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, repulsed the counterattack of the capitalist reactionary line, and strongly supported the broad leftist masses. The facts tell us that without awareness of the struggle between the two lines, one is a fool and will make big mistakes, losing one's head without knowing how it happened; with a high awareness of the struggle between the two lines, one can stand firm in the face of great storms and waves, unshakably standing on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Keeping the string of the struggle between the two lines taut makes us clear about right and wrong, correctly handling contradictions among the people. During our support-leftist work in "Jiang Textile," we encountered such an incident. Once, a workshop was to establish a propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought, and a young female worker who had once taken the wrong side eagerly volunteered to join, but someone said, "Our workshop has so many rebels, letting her perform on stage is not honorable." This incident sparked a debate. We brought this question to our study of Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling the two types of contradictions and uniting the majority, realizing that at the critical moment of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, only by following Chairman Mao's great teachings, constantly paying attention to strictly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions, can we grasp the revolutionary struggle's direction in the sharp and complex struggle, always directing the spearhead at the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party led by China's Khrushchev, continually strengthening the revolutionary ranks, and uniting all revolutionary forces under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line into a surging revolutionary army, jointly fighting the enemy. Thus, we and revolutionary workers together organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes, helping revolutionary masses raise their awareness of the struggle between the two lines, guiding their petty-bourgeois ideology onto the track of proletarian revolution, further consolidating the workshop's revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination.

	In the Struggle Between the Two Lines, Breaking Private Interests and Establishing Public Interests Is the Necessary Path for the Thought Revolution of Revolutionary Soldiers
Our pledge is: "Break at the crucial point, establish at the root, let the word 'public' command every second of life!"

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." Revolutionary soldiers must consciously break private interests and establish public interests in the struggle between the two lines, thoroughly transforming their worldview, so that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line can deeply take root in their minds, bravely and firmly implementing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

	"Don't mind me!" is the heroic words of our excellent platoon leader Li Wenzhong when he sacrificed his life to implement and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This spirit of selflessness is also the highest standard for the thought revolution of all of us in the platoon. On the front line of the "three supports, two militaries" mission, we closely linked the actual thoughts in the struggle between the two lines, thoroughly breaking "private" interests and establishing "public" interests, raising the study and application of Chairman Mao's works and the breaking of private interests and establishment of public interests to the height of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and defending the proletarian revolutionary power. When we first arrived at a certain factory in Jiangxi to support the leftists, the struggle was sharp and complex. Some comrades were afraid of saying the wrong thing, doing the wrong thing, losing face, and losing prestige. Platoon Leader Li Wenzhong immediately grasped this actual thought, inspiring everyone to bring their questions, using the "Three Articles" as a weapon, linking the reality of the struggle between the two lines, and fighting against private thoughts. Everyone realized that fear of this and that was ultimately due to the mischief of "private" interests. If "private" interests are not overcome, the "fear" will not be discarded, and one cannot consciously implement and bravely defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Our platoon widely carried out the activity of "one thing in front, one heart for the public," determined to uproot all private thoughts that obstruct the implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, firmly standing on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the great storms and waves of class struggle.

	Regarding "private" interests, we must "completely expose, fiercely fight, and resolutely change." "Completely expose" means to completely expose all private thoughts, turning over every box and drawer for a thorough cleanup, making them all exposed under the sun; "fiercely fight" means to set up the battlefield in the depths of the soul, grasp the key points, launch an offensive against "private" interests, fighting until one's face is flushed, body sweats, cannot eat, cannot sleep, and fights to the end; "resolutely change" means to have a goal and willpower, making up one's mind, changing one's bones and blood, and if not changed, one will not rest in peace. Exposure, fighting, and changing are closely connected; exposure is the prerequisite, fighting is the key, and changing is the implementation. The three are indispensable.

	In the process of exposure, fighting, and changing, we realized that we must pay attention to:

	Grasp "a fleeting thought." In the battle of rescuing Red Guard youths in the rapid currents of the Gan River, Platoon Leader Pang Chaosheng was tenacious and brave, leading the charge, rescuing eight Red Guards in succession. After he got ashore, he suddenly noticed a black spot far away floating with the river. At this moment, he suddenly had a thought: "I am already very tired, is that black spot a Red Guard who was not rescued?" Chairman Mao's teachings of "protecting the leftists" and "being responsible to the people" immediately made him realize that loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line means not considering one's own fatigue. He jumped into the river again, tenaciously swimming to the black spot, only to find it was a small wooden plank. We realized that grasping "a fleeting thought" is grasping the struggle between "public" and "private" interests in the struggle between the two lines. The struggle between public and private in the mind is like the struggle between enemy and self on the battlefield. If "public" interests relax even a little, "private" interests will seize the opportunity to emerge and launch a fierce attack. At this moment when "private" interests emerge, "public" interests must, with absolute superiority, suppress and devour "private" interests, quickly occupying the position.

	Grasp "critical moments." Critical moments are the moments of severe test for everyone, and also the decisive moments of the struggle between public and private interests. When we entered "Jiang Textile" to support the leftists, after a period of in-depth investigation, we identified the revolutionary leftists. At this time, a small handful of capitalist roaders within the factory used rumors, insults, and threatening letters to sabotage our military support-leftist work. Some comrades were afraid of trouble and dared not publicly express their views. At this critical moment, which side should we stand on? The entire platoon repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions: "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses." Chairman Mao's teachings made us discard "private" interests and "fear." To defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we dared to climb mountains of knives and seas of fire, shedding blood and sacrificing our lives without hesitation. We decisively supported the proletarian revolutionary forces. In this way, at every critical moment of turning points, prominent contradictions, and sharp struggles, we firmly grasped "private" interests, fiercely fought, making the roots of "public" interests deeper and deeper.

	Grasp "the third line." We realized that "private" interests have three lines: the first line's private interests are known to everyone, the second line's private interests are unknown to others but relatively easy to expose, and the third line's private interests are very hidden, sometimes exposed but often wearing a "legal" disguise. Such private interests are more harmful. Grasping the "third line" is equivalent to raiding the home of "private" interests. During our support-leftist work in "Jiang Textile," there was a period when our work achievements were relatively outstanding, but we also found that some comrades lacked deep proletarian feelings when doing ideological work, deciding to publicly check with the masses. At this time, some comrades said: "Achievements are the mainstream, a few shortcomings can be changed with attention, public checks will affect prestige." At first glance, it seems to be for the collective and work, but it is precisely the hidden "private" interests in the depths of the soul. We brought this question to our study of Chairman Mao's teachings on "promoting achievements, correcting errors, and preparing for the next battle," realizing that only with high standards and strict requirements, quickly and thoroughly checking and correcting shortcomings and errors, can we better implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The entire platoon immediately went to the masses, widely soliciting opinions, humbly listening to criticism, seriously checking and correcting shortcomings, advancing the support-leftist work another step.

	"Unlimited splendor is on the perilous peak." With our red-hearted loyalty to Chairman Mao, we are determined to more consciously break private interests and establish public interests in the struggle between the two lines, continually promoting thought revolution, raising awareness of the struggle between the two lines, and always standing on a new starting line, "Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance!"

    无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线
    做无产阶级专政下继续革命的先进战士
    “支左爱民模范排”
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们全排同志积极响应林副主席关于把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新阶段的号召，紧密结合两条路线斗争的实际，活学活用毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，象我们的好排长李文忠那样，对我们无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，坚决贯彻、誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线，努力做无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的先进分子。
        毛主席的无产阶级革命路线
              是革命战士的灵魂
    我们的誓言是：“生为毛主席革命路线战斗，死为毛主席革命路线献身！”
    林副主席指出：“对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是一个很重要的问题。我们就是要抓对毛主席的态度、对毛泽东思想的态度问题。”革命战士对毛主席、毛泽东思想、毛主席的革命路线所抱的态度，集中地表现在一个金光灿烂的“忠”字上。我们全排同志，都自觉地把“忠”字作为改造灵魂的标准。“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进！”一句话：“生为毛主席革命路线战斗，死为毛主席革命路线献身！”这就是我们忠于毛主席革命路线的坚强誓言。
    我们是怎样锤炼忠于毛主席革命路线的红心呢？
    狠抓阶级教育，把对于毛主席革命路线的无限忠诚建筑在深厚的无产阶级感情的基础上。一九六六年夏天，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派，疯狂地推行资产阶级反动路线，妄图把毛主席亲自发动和领导的轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动镇压下去。这情景我们看在眼里，恨在心头。不久，伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定了“十六条”。李文忠排长激动得眼含泪水，给大家连着宣读了两遍。他满怀激情地说：“同志们，‘十六条’就是无产阶级文化大革命的纲领，它标志着毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，资产阶级反动路线的彻底破产。”为了激发大家对毛主席革命路线的无比热爱的无产阶级感情，李文忠排长带领全排访贫问苦，还在老贫农家里吃了一顿“忆苦饭”。吃饭时，老大爷、老大娘流着眼泪控诉了旧社会的苦，满面笑容地谈了今日的甜。同志们联系昔日苦控诉资产阶级反动路线的滔天罪行；联系今日甜大赞毛主席的革命路线的英明正确。同志们深深懂得：毛主席的革命路线是劳动人民翻身求解放的正确路线，是无产阶级革命胜利的生命线，从而激发了大家对毛主席的革命路线的深厚的无产阶级感情。大家向毛主席宣誓：“生为毛主席革命路线战斗，死为毛主席革命路线献身！”
    认真学习毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列的最新指示，深刻理解无限忠于毛主席的革命路线是时代的第一需要，是革命的第一需要。每当伟大领袖毛主席发出一项最新指示，我们都做到及时传达，深入学习，认真领会，立即照办，步步紧跟。同志们说：“离北京城千山万水，跟毛主席寸步不离。”当伟大领袖毛主席首次接见红卫兵的喜讯传到连队，李文忠排长就满腔热忱地对大家说：“同志们，伟大领袖毛主席支持、热爱红卫兵。毛主席支持，我们就支持，毛主席热爱，我们就热爱，红卫兵运动好得很！”这天晚上，我们全排纷纷写信告诉自己的亲友，以极大的政治热情，赞扬和支持红卫兵小将的一切革命行动。
    紧密结合两条路线斗争的实际，活学活用毛主席的最新指示，锤炼对于毛主席革命路线的赤胆忠心。我们坚决执行林副主席关于学习毛泽东思想“在‘用’字上狠下功夫”的指示，学了就用，把毛主席的每项最新指示，都变成自觉的行动。去年八月十八日晚，李文忠排长作了护送红卫兵的动员后，同志们都写决心书。李从全同志说：“毛主席‘要保护左派’的伟大指示，就是我的决心书！”他在自己本子上工工整整地写下了毛主席的教导：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”“我们的责任，是向人民负责。”第二天，在赣江急流抢救红卫兵的紧要关头，他劈波斩浪，不顾生死，手持一块小木板，一连救出了三个红卫兵。在他精疲力竭的时刻，看到几个革命小将处在危险中，便以“完全”、“彻底”，“向人民负责”的精神，迅速把木板推给了革命小将，而自己却献出了年轻的生命，实现了“生为毛主席革命路线战斗，死为毛主席革命路线献身”的豪迈誓言。
        毛主席的无产阶级革命路线
          是革命战士的行动准则
    我们的誓言是：“把头脑里两条路线斗争的弦，时刻绷得紧紧的！”
    毛主席教导我们：“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”在两条路线斗争中，你不是站在毛主席革命路线一边，就是站在资产阶级反动路线一边。我们必须不断提高路线斗争的觉悟，把两条路线斗争的弦，时刻绷得紧紧的。只有这样，才能在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，看得清，站得稳，顶得住，自觉地执行和捍卫毛主席的革命路线。
    时刻绷紧两条路线斗争的弦，使我们心明眼亮，认清了敌人。毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”当中国赫鲁晓夫被揪出来以后，全排马上重温了毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”，运用两条路线斗争的观点，对中国赫鲁晓夫在一九六二年大刮单干风，一九六四年的形“左”实右，以及在无产阶级文化大革命中推行资产阶级反动路线的种种罪行，进行了深刻的揭发和批判。大家进一步深刻地理解了，毛主席的革命路线是把中国革命和世界革命进行到底的红线，是由社会主义过渡到共产主义的金桥。而中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，是复辟资本主义的黑线。中国赫鲁晓夫是叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派以及没有改造好的地富反坏右的总代表，是最危险最主要的敌人。全排同志愤慨地表示：“不把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派斗倒斗臭，不把世界上一切害人虫消灭干净，死不瞑目。”决心做到，心为保卫毛主席革命路线想，劲为保卫毛主席革命路线使，血为保卫毛主席革命路线流，“砍头不要紧，只要主义真，保卫毛主席，死了也甘心。”不久，我们在江西执行“三支”“两军”任务中，怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫的深仇大恨，坚定地站在毛主席革命路线一边，击退了资产阶级反动路线的反扑，有力地支持了左派广大群众。事实告诉我们，没有路线斗争的觉悟，就是糊涂虫，就会犯大错误，脑袋掉了还不知怎么掉的；有了高度的路线斗争觉悟，就能够做到在大风大浪中不转向，坚定不移地站在毛主席的革命路线上。
    时刻绷紧两条路线斗争的弦，使我们是非分明，正确地处理人民内部矛盾。在“江纺”支左时，遇到这样一件事。有一次，一准备车间要成立毛泽东思想宣传队，一个曾站错队的青年女工积极报名参加，可是，有人说：“咱们车间造反派这么多，让她上台演戏不光彩。”这件事，引起了一场争论。我们带着这个问题，学习了毛主席关于正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾和团结大多数的教导，认识到，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的关键时刻，只有遵照毛主席的伟大教导，时刻注意严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，才能在尖锐复杂的斗争中，牢牢掌握革命斗争大方向，始终把矛头对准以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的一小撮走资派，才能不断地壮大革命队伍，使一切革命力量在毛主席革命路线的指引下，汇成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，共同对敌。于是，我们和革命工人一起，办起了毛泽东思想学习班，帮助革命群众提高路线斗争的觉悟，把他们中间的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道上，进一步巩固了车间革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
        在两条路线斗争中破私立公，是革命战士思想革命化的必由之路
    我们的誓言是：“破在要害处，立在根本上，让‘公’字统帅生命的每一秒钟！”
    毛主席教导我们：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。革命战士必须在两条路线斗争中，自觉地破私立公，彻底地改造世界观，才能使毛主席的革命路线在头脑里深深扎根，勇敢坚定地执行和捍卫毛主席的革命路线。
      “不要管我！”是好排长李文忠为执行和捍卫毛主席的革命路线而光荣献身时的豪言壮语。这种一心为公的共产主义精神也是我们全排同志思想革命化的最高标准。我们在执行“三支”“两军”任务的第一线上，紧密结合两条路线斗争中的活思想，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，把活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，提高到保卫毛主席的革命路线，保卫无产阶级革命政权的高度来认识。我们刚到江西的某工厂支左时，斗争尖锐复杂。有的同志怕说错话、办错事、丢面子、失威信。排长李文忠立即抓住了这个活思想，启发大家带着问题，以“老三篇”为武器，联系两条路线斗争的现实，狠斗了私心杂念。大家认识到，怕这怕那，归根到底是“私”字作怪。“私”字打不倒，“怕”字丢不掉，就不能自觉执行、勇敢捍卫毛主席的革命路线。我们排广泛开展了“一事当前，一心为公”的活动，决心把障碍贯彻执行毛主席革命路线的一切私心杂念连根拔除，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，坚定不移地站在毛主席的革命路线一边。
    对“私”字要“彻底地亮，狠狠地斗，坚决地改”。“彻底地亮”，就是要把一切私心杂念，全盘端，翻箱倒柜大扫除，使其全部暴露在光天化日之下；“狠狠地斗”，就是在灵魂深处摆战场，抓住要害，向“私”字打进攻战，要斗得脸上发烧，身上出汗，吃不下饭，睡不着觉，斗到底；“坚决地改”，就是要有目标，有毅力，横下一条心，脱胎换骨，改造不好死不瞑目。亮、斗、改三者紧密相连，亮是前提，斗是关键，改是落实，三者缺一不可。
    我们在亮、斗、改的过程中体会到，一定要注意：
    抓“一闪念”。在赣江激流抢救红卫兵小将的战斗中，班长庞朝胜，顽强勇敢，一马当先，一连救出了八名红卫兵。当他上岸以后，忽然发现离他很远的地方，有个黑点顺着江水漂流。这时他忽然闪过一个念头：“已经很累了，那个黑点是不是没救出来的红卫兵？”毛主席的“要保护左派”、“向人民负责”的教导立刻使他意识到，忠于毛主席的革命路线，就不能考虑自己的疲劳。他又纵身跳入江中，顽强地游到黑点跟前，才看清是块小木板。我们体会到，抓“一闪念”，就是抓在两条路线斗争中，用“公”字战胜“私”字的一闪念。头脑里公和私的斗争，就象战场上敌我拚刺刀一样，如果“公”字稍有松弛，“私”字就会乘机闪出，猛攻上来。在这“私”字闪出的时刻，“公”字要以绝对的优势，把“私”字压倒、吃掉，迅速占领阵地。
    抓“关键时刻”。关键时刻就是对每个人严峻考验的时刻，也是公和私斗争的决战时刻。我们进驻“江纺”支左时，经过一段深入调查，识别了革命左派。这时候，厂内一小撮走资派采取造谣、谩骂、写威胁信等手段破坏我军支左。有的同志怕出乱子，不敢公开表态。就在这关键时刻，应该站在哪一边？全排同志反复学习了毛主席的指示：“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众。”毛主席的教导使我们斗掉“私”字，去掉“怕”字。为捍卫毛主席的革命路线，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，流血牺牲，在所不惜。我们果断地支持了无产阶级革命派。就这样，在每次形势转折、矛盾突出、斗争尖锐的关键时刻，我们都紧紧抓住“私”字，狠斗、猛斗，使“公”字的根子越扎越深。
    抓“第三线”。我们体会到“私”字分三线，第一线上的私是众所周知的私，第二线上的私，是别人不知但是比较容易亮的私，第三线上的私则是很隐蔽的私，有时暴露出来也往往披着“合法”的外衣，这样的私危害更大。抓了“第三线”，就等于抄了“私”字的家。在“江纺”支左中，有段时间工作成绩较突出，但也发现有的同志做思想工作时缺乏深厚的无产阶级感情，就决定公开向群众作检查。这时，有的同志却说：“成绩是主流，有点缺点注意改就行了，公开检查会影响威信。”乍听，是为集体、为工作着想，其实恰恰是隐蔽在灵魂深处的“私”字。我们就带着这个问题，学习毛主席关于“发扬成绩，纠正错误，以利再战”的教导，认识到，只有高标准、严要求，迅速、彻底检查和改正缺点、错误，才能更好地贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线。全排同志立即深入到群众中去，广泛征求意见，虚心听取批评，认真检查和改正了缺点，使支左工作又前进了一步。
      “无限风光在险峰”。我们怀着对毛主席的赤胆忠心，决心在两条路线斗争中，更加自觉地破私立公，不断促进思想革命化，努力提高路线斗争觉悟，永远立足在新的起跑线上，“毛主席挥手我前进”！
