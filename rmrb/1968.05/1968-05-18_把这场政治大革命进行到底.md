As we enthusiastically celebrate the second anniversary of the issuance of the great document personally drafted by our great leader Chairman Mao, the editorial departments of the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and the *Liberation Army Daily* have published an important article titled "A Document of Epoch-Making Significance." The entire standing committee of our revolutionary committee immediately conducted a serious study of it. We are determined to follow our great leader Chairman Mao closely, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

When our factory's revolutionary committee was first established, a certain view emerged within the factory, claiming that the "reactionary revisionist line has been criticized enough," and that "now that the revolutionary committee is established, there are only a few rotten fish and decayed shrimp left, who can't cause much trouble." At that time, the revolutionary committee did not firmly grasp class struggle, so big-character posters gradually decreased, and criticism meetings were no longer held. Under these circumstances, a handful of class enemies stirred up a rightist reversal wind, openly demanding that the revolutionary committee rehabilitate them.

The PLA propaganda team stationed in the factory, in response to this situation, organized the members of the revolutionary committee to seriously study Chairman Mao's great teachings: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China, led by its great leader Chairman Mao, and the broad revolutionary masses of the people, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie."

Chairman Mao's great teachings have enabled us to have a deeper understanding of the great significance and class content of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, with China's Khrushchev, who has repeatedly knelt down before imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, as their leader, represent the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the interests of imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. A considerable number of them are the dregs and remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Our struggle against these counter-revolutionary elements is a sharp, complex, and life-and-death struggle. We must not have the slightest slackness or complacency. We must carry this political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes through to the end. Everyone realized that the rightist reversal wind in the factory was a counterattack by class enemies against the newly established revolutionary committee and the revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses! The revolutionary committee must lead the masses in launching an offensive against a handful of class enemies.

We immediately convened a meeting to criticize the rightist reversal wind and launched a head-on attack against a handful of class enemies. We organized the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, recalling the class struggle in the factory since its establishment, exposing the current sabotage activities of class enemies. Through great denunciations, great exposures, and great criticisms, we further raised the class struggle consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses, recognized the reactionary nature of class enemies, launched a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, and implemented dictatorship over them.

"Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." Currently, the revolutionary and production situation in our factory is excellent. The revolution is booming, and the production tasks for April were overfulfilled. We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and under the guidance of the *Notification*, fully complete the great historical task of the first proletarian cultural revolution in human history, allowing the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to fly high in our factory, forever!

    把这场政治大革命进行到底
    天津市卫东无线电厂革命委员会
    在我们热烈庆祝伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的《通知》发表两周年的时候，《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》编辑部发表了重要文章——《划时代的文献》。我们革委会全体常委立即认真进行了学习，大家决心紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    我厂革命委员会刚成立的时候，厂里出现了一种论调，说什么“反革命修正主义路线批得差不多了”，
  “革委会成立了，还剩几个臭鱼烂虾，掀不起大浪来”。当时，革委会也没有狠抓阶级斗争，因此，大字报渐渐少了，批判会也不开了。在这种情况下，一小撮阶级敌人刮起了右倾翻案妖风，公然要革委会为他们平反。
    驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队针对这种情况，组织革委会成员认真学习了毛主席的伟大教导：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”
    毛主席的这一伟大教导，使我们更深刻地认识了这场无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义和阶级内容。以中国赫鲁晓夫这个多次跪倒在帝国主义和国民党反动派脚下的可耻叛徒为首的党内一小撮走资派，是代表国民党反动派的利益，代表帝国主义、资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右利益的反革命黑帮。其中相当一部分人，就是国民党反动派的残渣余孽。我们同这些反革命分子的斗争，是一场尖锐复杂的、你死我活的斗争，我们决不能有丝毫的松懈麻痹。我们必须把这场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底。大家认识到，厂里出现的右倾翻案妖风，就是阶级敌人在向新生的革命委员会反扑，向无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众反扑！革委会必须率领群众向一小撮阶级敌人打进攻战。
    于是，我们立即召开了批判右倾翻案风的大会，向一小撮阶级敌人展开迎头痛击。我们组织群众活学活用毛主席著作，回忆建厂以来阶级斗争的情况，揭发阶级敌人现行的破坏活动。经过大控诉、大揭发、大批判，进一步提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争觉悟和路线斗争觉悟，认清了阶级敌人的反动本质，向一小撮阶级敌人发起猛攻，对一小撮阶级敌人实行了专政。
    “阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”目前，我厂革命、生产形势一片大好。革命搞得轰轰烈烈，四月份生产任务超额完成。我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在《通知》的指引下，全面完成人类历史上第一次无产阶级文化大革命的伟大历史任务，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在我厂高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
