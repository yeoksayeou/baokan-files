The mighty winds of Mao Zedong Thought are sweeping across the nation. Amidst this great situation, as we celebrate the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great teacher, great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, together with the 500,000 military and civilian people of the capital, are jointly celebrating the day of unity and struggle for the proletariat and working people of the world, the "May Day" International Labor Day. At this inspiring moment, we raise a thousand cheers: Long live our great teacher, great leader Chairman Mao! Long live!

Chairman Mao teaches us that the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to complete victory, the more complex and profound the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads will be. The Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party are the representatives of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, the agents of the Kuomintang reactionaries. The handful of traitors, spies, counter-revolutionary two-faced characters, unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries mixed within our revolutionary ranks are big snakes and small snakes, black snakes and white snakes, snakes that bare their fangs and snakes that disguise themselves as beautiful women. We will show no mercy to these snake-like evil people. We must remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "All commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army must never relax their fighting spirit. Any thought of relaxing the fighting spirit or underestimating the enemy is wrong." We, the People's Liberation Army, resolutely respond to the battle cry of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching that "the rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended by struggle," we take action, resolutely oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, repel the rightist reversal of verdicts by the class enemy, and vow to defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

At present, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent and getting better. However, we must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching to "never forget class struggle," use Mao Zedong Thought to observe and analyze everything, and fundamentally raise the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the proletariat. We must remember Chairman Mao's teaching to talk about class struggle "year after year, month after month, day after day," seriously study the May Day editorial of the central newspapers, strengthen the awareness of the enemy, heighten revolutionary vigilance, and use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to help revolutionary masses identify and expose those who pretend to support the revolution but actually oppose it, and dig out all hidden class enemies.

"One should pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength and not seek fame like King Xiang Yu." We, the People's Liberation Army, are the people's army created and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the defender of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must actively learn from and apply Mao Zedong Thought in class struggle, strengthen military-civilian unity in the "three supports and two militaries," and together with the broad revolutionary masses, actively and unceasingly attack the class enemy. Under the guidance of the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, we will seize the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　扫除一切害人虫，全无敌
　　空军第二次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表、战斗英雄　岳振华
    毛泽东思想的浩荡东风，吹遍全国。在一片大好形势下，在我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，同首都五十万军民，共同欢庆全世界无产阶级和劳动人民团结战斗的节日“五一”国际劳动节。在这振奋人心的时刻，我们千万声欢呼：敬祝我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席教导我们，无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争越是复杂，越是深刻。中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派，是资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的总代表，是国民党反动派的代理人。混在我们革命队伍内部的一小撮叛徒、特务、反革命两面派，没有改造好的地富反坏右分子和国民党反动派的残渣余孽，他们是大蛇和小蛇，黑蛇和白蛇，露出毒牙的蛇和化成美女的蛇。我们决不怜惜这些蛇一样的恶人。我们要牢记毛主席的教导：“人民解放军的全体指挥员、战斗员，绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志，任何松懈战斗意志的思想和轻敌的思想，都是错误的。”我们人民解放军最坚决地响应以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，遵照毛主席关于“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫”的教导，行动起来，坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，打退阶级敌人的右倾翻案风，誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫毛泽东思想，誓死保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线！
    当前，无产阶级文化大革命的形势一片大好，越来越好。但是，我们要时刻记住毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，用毛泽东思想来观察一切，分析一切，从根本上提高无产阶级的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，对于阶级斗争，要“年年讲，月月讲，天天讲”，要认真学习中央报刊的“五一”社论，加强敌情观念，提高革命警惕性，要以毛泽东思想为武器，帮助革命群众识别和揭露那些伪装拥护革命而实际反对革命的反革命两面派，把一切暗藏的阶级敌人统统挖出来。
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造和领导、林副统帅直接指挥的人民军队，是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石，是无产阶级文化大革命的捍卫者。我们一定要在阶级斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，在“三支”“两军”中大力加强军民团结，同广大革命群众一起，主动地、不停顿地向阶级敌人进攻。在伟大统帅毛主席最新指示的指引下，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
