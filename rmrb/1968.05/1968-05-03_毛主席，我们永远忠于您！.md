On the night of May 1st, the people of Beijing gathered at Tiananmen Square to celebrate the International Labor Day, a day of unity and struggle for the proletariat and laboring people of the world. They enthusiastically celebrated the brilliant victories of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! They enthusiastically hailed the new era marked by the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought! They enthusiastically hailed long live Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!

At nine o'clock in the evening, the most joyous moment we had been eagerly awaiting arrived! Amidst the majestic melody of "The East Is Red," our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, ascended the Tiananmen Gate. Chairman Mao is in excellent health, full of vigor, and radiant as he stood before us, greeting us warmly. Chairman Mao spending the May 1st International Labor Day with us is the greatest care and encouragement for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the entire army. Millions of hearts were beating fiercely, and millions of smiling faces turned towards the red sun. We waved our red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted enthusiastically, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!"

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The revolutionary workers and all the support-left personnel of Beijing Knitting Factory have so much to say to you, so many songs of praise to sing to you! All our words and songs can be summed up in one sentence:

"Wishing you, Chairman Mao, eternal health and longevity!"

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Looking back at our more than ten months of supporting the left in the Beijing Knitting Factory, every step forward was guided by your brilliant thoughts, and every victory was a great victory for your proletarian revolutionary line! It was you who issued the call for revolutionary great unity, which prompted the two revolutionary mass organizations in the factory to unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought with the spirit of "seizing the day." It was you who pointed out the direction for the construction of the revolutionary committee, which prompted us to advance on the road of "building a revolutionary leadership cadre that is connected with the masses." It was you who called for "struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism" and for establishing study classes, which prompted us to establish various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the factory, fully implementing your latest instructions, making your brilliant thoughts widely known, and transforming the spiritual outlook of the workers, making the revolutionary situation excellent.

Recently, you taught us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the reactionary Kuomintang led by the broad revolutionary masses, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Your latest instructions further pointed out the direction for our current struggle. We follow your great teachings, together with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and all revolutionary workers in the factory, using your brilliant thoughts as our weapon, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle, closely combining it with the actual class struggle in the factory, and carrying out a deeper and more sustained revolutionary criticism. We launched a comprehensive and fierce attack on the revisionist fallacies spread by the clique of traitors and renegades within the party led by China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee led by Peng Zhen, as well as their agents in the factory. We exposed and criticized them vigorously, dealing a fatal blow to the handful of class enemies who attempted to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and smashing their evil plot to restore capitalism. This has strengthened the revolutionary great unity and the newly established revolutionary committee, making the revolutionary situation even better.

You called on us to "grasp revolution, promote production," "save money for revolution," and "must grasp grain, must grasp cotton, must grasp cloth." We resolutely respond to your great call, using the revolutionization of people's thoughts to drive the production and saving movement, completing the production tasks ahead of schedule every month, making the factory's production flourish, and presenting a completely new situation that the factory has never had before.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We solemnly pledge to you: We will not disappoint your earnest expectations. We will definitely hold high the great red flag of your brilliant thoughts and fully implement your latest instructions. We will insist on and carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, launch a more fierce attack on the class enemies, overthrow and expose China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, and dig out all the traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries hiding in the dark corners. We will resolutely oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, and smash the rightist wind of reversal. We will grasp the revolution and vigorously promote production. We will be good at uniting and winning over the vast majority of the masses, strengthen military-civilian unity, humbly learn from the proletarian revolutionaries, further do a good job in serving the people, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, advance by leaps and bounds, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! We will not lay down our arms until we achieve complete victory!

We will definitely implement your brilliant "May 7th" instructions and turn the Beijing Knitting Factory into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought!
