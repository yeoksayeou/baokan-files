African friends cheer Mao's declaration, sounding the battle cry to attack U.S. imperialism
World's people support each other to defeat common enemy, U.S. imperialism

Congolese (Brazzaville)
A friend named Munga said that the great helmsman, Chairman Mao, whom the oppressed peoples and nations respect, issued a brilliant declaration exposing the true face of the U.S. imperialist aggressors, the number one enemy of the peoples of all countries. He said: "This declaration sounds the call for the enslaved peoples and nations to rise up against the imperialists, first and foremost against U.S. imperialism." Chairman Mao's declaration points the way for the revolutionary peoples of all countries to carry the struggle against U.S. imperialism through to the end.

Munga emphasized: We revolutionary people, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, will surely achieve final victory in the revolution.

Another friend named Etienne Miyazi said that Chairman Mao is the great leader of the revolutionary peoples of the whole world. Chairman Mao has always been at the forefront, supporting and leading the just struggles of the oppressed peoples of the world against imperialism, colonialism, and revisionism.

He said, the revolutionary peoples of the world, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and following the revolutionary line laid down by Chairman Mao, can defeat the common enemy and ultimately put an end to the evil rule of the American monopolistic bourgeoisie.

Mali
A friend said, Chairman Mao's declaration not only points out the direction for the struggle of the American Negroes but also for the struggle of all oppressed and exploited peoples. This means that revolutionary violence must be used against counter-revolutionary violence. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." "Where the broom does not reach, the dust will not go away by itself." The Vietnamese people have already set us an example.

Another friend said, Chairman Mao's declaration is a great encouragement to the American Negroes. Armed struggle is the only effective way to overthrow the imperialist system and achieve complete liberation.

A teacher said, Chairman Mao's declaration points the way for the American Negroes. As Chairman Mao said, this is a class struggle, therefore, the American Negroes' struggle against violence will inevitably combine with the American workers' movement, overthrow the rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie, and achieve complete liberation. The American Negroes will certainly follow the path pointed out by Chairman Mao and march from victory to victory.

Mozambique
A freedom fighter named Elias said: "Chairman Mao's declaration has dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism. This declaration is not only a great support and encouragement to the American Negroes in their struggle but also to all revolutionary peoples of the world."

He pointed out that Chairman Mao's declaration once again shows that Chairman Mao is deeply concerned about the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed and exploited peoples of the world.

Another freedom fighter named Chikwemba said: "We Mozambican freedom fighters firmly support the struggle of the American Negroes. Whatever Chairman Mao supports, we support, because Chairman Mao is the great leader of the world's revolutionary peoples."

He pointed out that the struggle of the American Negroes and the Mozambican people will surely be victorious because the great leader Chairman Mao stands with them.

An old warrior who had participated in several fierce battles, Augusto, said: "We Mozambican freedom fighters firmly respond to Chairman Mao's call and firmly support the American Negroes' struggle against violence."

He said: "The struggle of the American Negroes and the Mozambican people is one of mutual support. U.S. imperialism is the head of world imperialism and the chief culprit helping the Portuguese colonialists massacre the Mozambican people. The struggle of the American Negroes and the peoples of Mozambique, Angola, 'Portuguese' Guinea, and Vietnam is directed against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism."

Senegal
A worker wrote to a Xinhua News Agency reporter: "Chairman Mao's declaration supporting the American Negroes' struggle against violence is not only support and encouragement for the American Negroes but also great support and encouragement for the peoples of all countries who are fighting against all imperialists, old and new colonialists, and reactionaries of all countries."

He said, the assassination of the non-violent advocate Martin Luther King by the U.S. imperialists will raise the revolutionary consciousness of the broad masses of American Negroes and at the same time declare the bankruptcy of the theory of seizing power through "peaceful" means advocated by the Soviet revisionists. He went on to point out that the Soviet modern revisionists led by Brezhnev and Kosygin have become the most loyal lackeys of U.S. imperialism.

A female student in Dakar wrote to the Xinhua News Agency's Dakar bureau: "Chairman Mao's declaration points out to us the contradiction between the broad masses of American Negroes and the American ruling class, which is a class contradiction."

She said: "The American Negroes can only achieve complete liberation by overthrowing the rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie and by overthrowing the U.S. imperialism that seeks to dominate the world."

### 非洲朋友欢呼毛主席声明吹响了向美帝进攻的战斗号角　世界人民相互支持打败共同敌人美帝

　　非洲朋友欢呼毛主席声明吹响了向美帝进攻的战斗号角
　　世界人民相互支持打败共同敌人美帝
　　刚果（布）
    一位朋友芒加说，被压迫人民和被压迫民族的敬爱的伟大舵手毛主席的光辉声明，揭露了各国人民的头号敌人美帝国主义侵略者的真面目。他说：“这个声明吹响了受奴役的人民和民族奋起反对帝国主义者，首先是反对美帝国主义者的号角。”毛主席这一声明为各国革命人民把反对美帝国主义的斗争进行到底指出了方向。
    芒加强调指出：我们革命人民以毛泽东思想作指导，革命就一定能取得最后胜利。
    另一个名叫埃蒂埃纳·米亚齐的朋友说，毛主席是全世界革命人民的伟大领袖。毛主席始终站在前头支持和领导全世界被剥削人民进行反对帝国主义、殖民主义和修正主义的正义斗争。
    他说，全世界革命人民用毛泽东思想武装起来，遵循毛主席制定的革命路线，就能战胜共同敌人，最终结束美国垄断资产阶级的罪恶统治。
　　马里
    一位朋友说，毛主席声明不仅指明美国黑人斗争的方向，而且指明了所有被压迫、被剥削人民斗争的方向。这就是说，必须以革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力。毛主席教导我们：“枪杆子里面出政权”。“扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”越南人民已经给我们树立了一个榜样。
    另一位朋友说，毛主席的声明对美国黑人是一个巨大的鼓舞。武装斗争是推翻帝国主义制度和取得彻底解放的唯一有效的斗争。
    一位教师说，毛主席的声明给美国黑人指明了正确的道路。正如毛主席所说的，这是一场阶级斗争，因此，美国黑人的抗暴斗争必将同美国工人运动相结合，推翻垄断资产阶级的统治，取得彻底解放。美国黑人必将遵循毛主席所指明的道路奋勇前进，从胜利走向胜利。
　　莫三鼻给
    一位名叫埃利亚斯的自由战士说：“毛主席的声明给了美帝国主义以沉重的打击。这个声明不仅对斗争中的美国黑人，而且对全世界一切革命人民都是一个巨大的支持和鼓舞。”
    他指出，毛主席这一声明再一次表明，毛主席是非常关心全世界被剥削、被压迫人民的革命斗争的。
    另一位名叫奇克温巴的自由战士说：“我们莫三鼻给自由战士坚决支持美国黑人的斗争。凡是毛主席支持的我们就支持，因为毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大领袖。”
    他指出，美国黑人的斗争和莫三鼻给人民的斗争必定胜利，因为伟大领袖毛主席同他们站在一起。
    曾经参加过几次激烈战斗的老战士奥古斯托说：“我们莫三鼻给自由战士坚决响应毛主席的号召，坚决支持美国黑人的抗暴斗争。”
    他说：“美国黑人和莫三鼻给人民的斗争是相互支持的。美帝国主义是世界帝国主义的头子，是帮助葡萄牙殖民主义者屠杀莫三鼻给人民的罪魁祸首。美国黑人的斗争和莫三鼻给、安哥拉、‘葡属’几内亚以及越南人民的斗争是针对共同敌人美帝国主义的。”
　　塞内加尔
    一位工人写信给新华社记者说：“毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明不仅是对美国黑人的支持和鼓舞，而且也是对正在同一切帝国主义者、新老殖民主义者和各国反动派进行斗争的世界各国人民的巨大支持和鼓舞。”
    他说，美帝国主义者暗杀非暴力主义者马丁·路德·金这一事件，将提高美国广大黑人的革命觉悟，同时也宣告了苏联修正主义者所鼓吹的用“和平”手段取得政权的谬论的破产。他接着指出，以勃列日涅夫、柯西金为首的苏联现代修正主义者已经变成美帝最忠实的帮凶。
    达喀尔的一位女学生在给新华社达喀尔分社的信中说：“毛主席的声明向我们指出了美国广大黑人同美国统治集团之间的矛盾，是阶级矛盾。”
    她说：“美国黑人只有推翻垄断资产阶级的统治，只有打倒企图主宰世界的美帝，才能取得彻底的解放。”　（据新华社讯）
