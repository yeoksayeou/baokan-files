The textile industry in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, has achieved continuous victories in both revolution and production. Under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the revolutionary masses and cadres have responded to Chairman Mao's call to "tighten up the production of cloth." They have been vigorously promoting revolution and production, using class struggle to drive forward production. They have achieved remarkable results. After fully exceeding the state plan last year, the textile industry in the city has exceeded the state plan every month from January to April this year. The average daily output of cotton yarn and cotton cloth has increased by more than 7% compared to last year. The daily output of dyed cloth has increased by 50%, and the production of knitted fabrics, colored fabrics, and synthetic fibers has also increased significantly. The quality is stable, and the variety has increased.

One important experience of the revolutionary masses and cadres in Shijiazhuang in promoting revolution and production is to firmly grasp class struggle, carry out thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, and actively attack the enemies of the proletariat without stopping.

After the great victory of the Cultural Revolution, a handful of class enemies do not accept their defeat. They use various methods to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks and continue to sabotage the revolution and production. The revolutionary masses and cadres on the textile front in Shijiazhuang, remembering Chairman Mao's teaching to "never forget class struggle," have heightened their revolutionary vigilance and repeatedly foiled the sabotage plots of the enemies of the proletariat. The production and technical departments of the Shijiazhuang Dyeing Factory were originally controlled by a handful of bad elements who had infiltrated the revolutionary ranks. They used every means to obstruct and sabotage production. The revolutionary masses, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasped class struggle, exposed this handful of class enemies, and took control of the production command. The production level immediately rose significantly, and more than fifty technological innovations and technological revolutions were realized.

The revolutionary masses and cadres on the textile front in Shijiazhuang have thoroughly and sustainably carried out revolutionary criticism, severely criticizing Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Shijiazhuang, and eliminating the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison they had spread in the textile industry for many years. In the past, Liu Shaoqi and his agents used a set of counter-revolutionary revisionist goods to corrupt the souls of the workers, bind the hands of the workers, and seriously hinder the development of productive forces. During the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, severely criticized Liu Shaoqi. They thoroughly criticized Liu Shaoqi's "profit-first" approach and emphasized proletarian politics; they thoroughly criticized "material incentives" and established the idea of "completely and thoroughly serving the people"; they thoroughly criticized "expert management" and established the mass line; they thoroughly criticized the bureaucratic institutions of revisionism and implemented streamlining and efficiency; they thoroughly criticized the philosophy of crawling and established the idea of continuous revolution; they thoroughly criticized the slavish mentality of worshipping foreign things and established the idea of self-reliance and striving for progress.

The revolutionary masses and cadres of Shijiazhuang Cotton Mill No. 1 closely combined revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their unit. They learned one revolutionary viewpoint of Chairman Mao, criticized one reactionary fallacy of Liu Shaoqi, eliminated one poisonous influence in their mill, and established one new revolutionary system, which effectively promoted the development of production and completed the state plan every month.

Another experience of the revolutionary masses and cadres on the textile front in Shijiazhuang in promoting revolution and production is to organize and run well Mao Zedong Thought study classes, help revolutionary cadres criticize and transform their private thoughts, solve various active thoughts, and promote the thought revolution of the broad revolutionary cadres. For a period, as production continued to improve, some material supply shortages appeared, and some people simply waited for state supplies. At this time, the revolutionary committees of many factories organized relevant personnel to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "frugality and revolution" and "self-reliance" in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, establishing the idea of self-reliance and frugality, and finding their own ways to overcome difficulties.

The revolutionary masses and cadres on the textile front in Shijiazhuang also carried out mass technological innovation and technological revolution activities. From January to April, 59 major technological innovation and technological revolution projects have been completed or are being carried out. The colored fabric weaving machine, jointly researched and successfully created by the revolutionary cadres of the Colored Fabric Factory and relevant departments, has increased production capacity by more than 20%.

    石家庄纺织工业战线革命和生产不断取得新胜利
    狠抓阶级斗争带动布匹增产
    去年全面超额完成计划，今年以来又月月超额完成计划
    新华社石家庄十日电　河北省石家庄纺织工业战线无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，响应毛主席“必须把布匹抓紧”的伟大号召，坚持抓革命，促生产，以阶级斗争带动生产斗争，取得很大成绩。全市纺织工业战线在去年全面超额完成国家计划以后，今年一至四月份又月月超额完成了国家计划，棉纱、棉布平均日产量都比去年增长百分之七以上，印染布的日产量增长了百分之五十，针织品、色织品和化纤织物的产量都有大幅度增长，质量稳定，品种增加。
    石家庄市广大革命职工抓革命促生产的一条重要经验是，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，不停顿地向无产阶级的敌人主动进攻。
    当无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利以后，一小撮阶级敌人并不甘心于他们的失败，他们采用各种方法，钻进革命队伍内部，继续破坏革命和生产。石家庄纺织工业战线的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，牢记毛主席
  “千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，百倍提高革命警惕性，一次又一次地粉碎了无产阶级的敌人的破坏阴谋。石家庄印染厂的生产技术部门，原来被混进革命队伍的一小撮坏人所把持，他们千方百计阻挠和破坏生产。广大革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓阶级斗争，把这一小撮阶级敌人揭露出来，把指挥生产的权力掌握在自己手里，生产水平立即大幅度上升，并实现了五十多个技术革新和技术革命的项目。
    石家庄纺织工业战线广大革命职工深入持久地开展革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在石家庄的代理人，清除他们多年来在纺织工业战线散布的反革命修正主义流毒。过去，中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人，用一整套反革命修正主义黑货，腐蚀工人的灵魂，束缚工人的手脚，严重地阻碍着生产力的发展。在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命职工以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫。他们大破中国赫鲁晓夫的“利润挂帅”，大力突出无产阶级政治；大破“物质刺激”，大立“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的思想；大破“专家治厂”，大立群众路线；大破修正主义的官僚机构，实行精兵简政；大破爬行哲学，大立不断革命思想；大破崇洋媚外的奴隶主义，大立自力更生、奋发图强的思想。
    石家庄国棉一厂的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，把革命大批判和本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来，他们学习毛主席的一个革命观点，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的一个反动谬论，肃清其在本厂的一股流毒，建立一项革命的新制度，有力地促进了生产的发展，月月都完成国家计划。
    石家庄纺织工业战线抓革命促生产的再一条经验是，大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，帮助革命职工斗私批修，解决各种活思想，促进广大革命职工的思想革命化。有一个时期，随着生产不断提高，出现了一些材料供应不足的现象，有的人就单纯等待国家供应。这时，许多工厂的革委会就组织有关人员在毛泽东思想学习班里学习毛主席的“要节约闹革命”和“自力更生”的教导，树立起自力更生和勤俭节约的思想，自己想办法克服了困难。
    石家庄纺织工业战线的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，还开展了群众性的技术革新、技术革命活动。一至四月份已经实现和正在进行的较大的技术革新和技术革命项目，已达五十九个。色织厂革命职工和有关部门共同研究和创造成功的色织箭杆织布机，使生产能力提高百分之二十以上。
