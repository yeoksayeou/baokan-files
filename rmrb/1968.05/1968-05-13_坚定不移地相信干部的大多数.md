In the face of a great situation both domestically and internationally, and amidst the victorious songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the editorial "The Red Earth of Northeast China" from *People's Daily* and *PLA Daily* conveyed the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao: "We must believe that more than 90% of the cadres are good or relatively good. Those who have made mistakes can mostly be corrected." Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the greatest care, concern, education, and hope for all revolutionary cadres and the revolutionary masses, guiding us in our "Three Supports, Two Military" work to a new battlefront.

A ship sails on the sea with a helmsman, and a revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. At every critical juncture of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is our great leader Chairman Mao who provides the most brilliant and timely guidance for our forward march. All our victories are the victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

In February of this year, following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao to "support the leftist masses," we arrived at the Xinhua Printing Plant. Upon entering the factory, the first issue we encountered was how to handle cadres who had made mistakes and were sidelined. Should we help them return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, or should we continue to keep them sidelined? Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must unite with the majority of the cadres. Cadres who have made mistakes, including those who have made serious mistakes, as long as they are not stubborn and unrepentant, should be united and educated. We must expand the scope of education and narrow the scope of criticism." Following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, we immediately organized the revolutionary workers to repeatedly study and discuss, deeply understanding Chairman Mao's series of extremely important instructions on the cadre issue. First, we raised the issue of attitude towards cadres to the level of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. We organized the revolutionary masses to fiercely criticize the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large number and protecting a few" pushed by Chinese Khrushchev in the cadre issue, overcoming bourgeois factionalism, and using proletarian party spirit to analyze and identify cadres, seeing whether they consistently support Chairman Mao, support Mao Zedong Thought, and execute Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, or the opposite. This fundamentally clarified the class line within the cadre ranks, avoiding the erroneous attitude of dealing with cadres based on bourgeois factionalism and mountainheadism.

Next, we must view cadres historically and comprehensively, opposing the isolated and one-sided view of cadres. "We must not only look at a cadre's actions at a single moment, but also at the cadre's entire history and work." We must distinguish whether their mistakes are antagonistic contradictions or contradictions among the people; whether they are consistent or whether they temporarily followed the bourgeois reactionary line of Chinese Khrushchev during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must see that in the long-term revolutionary struggle, more than 90% of the cadres have been tempered and tested by class struggle, possessing relatively rich revolutionary struggle experience and relatively strong work capabilities. They are precious revolutionary assets. From this comprehensive and historical perspective, we further corrected our attitude towards cadres and correctly handled cadres who had made mistakes.

At the same time, we organized cadre classes to study Mao Zedong Thought, with the participation of revolutionary mass representatives. In the process of studying Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, we carried out self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, quickly bringing out the good and relatively good cadres. Those who had made mistakes also gained the understanding and trust of the masses. So far, the majority of cadres have stood up and, together with the revolutionary masses, actively participated in the current class struggle. Some have taken on the responsibility of promoting revolution and production.

"Believe in and rely on the majority of cadres." Through the practice of supporting the left, we deeply feel that Chairman Mao's brilliant thought is brilliant, great, and correct. Without this, we would deviate from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and would not be able to fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. On the contrary, with this, we will always stand unshakable.

At this crucial moment of the struggle between the two classes and two lines, we must deeply understand and seriously implement Chairman Mao's great teachings. Only in this way can we correctly analyze and handle cadres, correctly distinguish between antagonistic contradictions and contradictions among the people, and unite and educate the majority of cadres.

We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continuously strengthen the revolutionary ranks, unite and win over allies, and unite all revolutionary forces on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we will form a mighty revolutionary army, always directing our spearhead at the handful of traitors, spies, diehard capitalist-roaders within the Party represented by Chinese Khrushchev, and all counter-revolutionaries. We must deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, actively and unceasingly launch fierce attacks on the class enemy, thoroughly smash the rightist reversal of verdicts wind, repel the counterattacks of the class enemy, and carry out the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end!

    坚定不移地相信干部的大多数
    驻北京市新华印刷厂支左部队
    在国内外一片大好形势下，在无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利的凯歌声中，《人民日报》、《解放军报》社论《东北大地红烂熳》，传达了我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“要相信百分之九十以上的干部是好的和比较好的。犯了错误的人，大多数是可以改的。”毛主席这一最新指示，是对广大革命干部和广大革命群众最大的爱护、最大的关怀、最大的教育和最大的希望，为我们参加“三支”“两军”工作的人员指明了新的战斗任务。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。在无产阶级文化大革命的每一个重要关头，总是伟大领袖毛主席最英明、最及时地给我们指明前进的方向。我们的一切胜利，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利。
    今年二月份，我们遵照伟大领袖毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的教导，来到了新华印刷厂。进厂后，我们遇到的第一个问题，就是对那些犯有错误而靠边站的干部怎么办？是帮助他们重新回到毛主席的革命路线上来呢？还是继续让他们靠边站？毛主席教导我们说：“要团结干部的大多数。犯了错误的干部，包括犯了严重错误的干部，只要不是坚持不改，屡教不改的，都要团结教育他们。要扩大教育面，缩小打击面”。遵照伟大领袖毛主席这一教导，我们立即组织广大革命职工反复学习、反复讨论，深刻领会毛主席关于干部问题所作的一系列极其重要的指示。首先，把对待干部的态度问题提到阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的高度来认识。我们组织广大革命群众狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在干部问题上推行的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，克服资产阶级派性，用无产阶级的党性去分析和识别干部，看他们是一贯拥护毛主席，拥护毛泽东思想，执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，还是相反。这就从根本上看清了干部队伍的阶级阵线，避免了从资产阶级派性出发，从山头主义出发对待干部的错误态度。
    其次，必须历史地、全面地看待干部，反对孤立地、片面地看待干部。“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作。”区分他们的错误是敌我矛盾，还是人民内部矛盾；是一贯的，还是在无产阶级文化大革命中一度执行了中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线的错误。必须看到，在长期的革命斗争中，百分之九十以上的干部经受了阶级斗争的锻炼和考验，他们有着比较丰富的革命斗争经验和比较强的工作能力，他们是革命的宝贵财富。从这样一个全面的、历史的观点出发，我们便进一步端正了对待干部的态度，正确地对待犯了错误的干部。
    与此同时，我们办了有革命群众代表参加的干部毛泽东思想学习班。在学习毛主席的一系列最新指示的过程中，进行斗私批修，使好的和比较好的干部，很快地站了出来。那些犯了错误的干部，也取得了广大群众的谅解和信任。到目前为止，大多数干部已站了出来，并和广大革命群众一起积极参加了当前的阶级斗争，有的已担负起抓革命促生产的重担。
      “相信和依靠干部的大多数”。通过支左工作的实践，使我们深深体会到，毛主席这一光辉思想的英明、伟大和正确。离开这一条，就会违背毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就不能够全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。反之，有了这一条，我们就永远立于不败之地。
    当前，在两个阶级、两条路线斗争的关键时刻，我们必须深刻领会和认真执行毛主席的这一伟大教导。只有这样，才能正确分析和对待干部，才能正确区分敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，才能团结和教育绝大多数干部。
    我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不断壮大革命队伍，团结和争取同盟军，使一切革命力量在毛泽东思想的基础上团结起来，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下汇成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，把矛头始终指向以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的党内一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和一切反革命分子。我们一定要深入、持久地开展革命的大批判，主动地、不停顿地向阶级敌人猛烈进攻，彻底粉碎右倾翻案风，击退阶级敌人的反扑，把“无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命”进行到底！
