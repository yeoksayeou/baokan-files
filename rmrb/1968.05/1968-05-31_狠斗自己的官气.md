    Quotations from Chairman Mao
    The most fundamental aspect of reforming state organs is to maintain close ties with the masses.

    Regimental Commander Lin Fuhuo accompanied the troops to the shooting range. On his return, he found that the jeep he had come in had been taken by someone else, which made him feel uncomfortable. After a struggle within himself, he did not criticize others but instead:

    Struggled Against His Own Officialdom

    Regimental Commander Lin Fuhuo went with a battalion to the shooting range. After completing the shooting, he and a few comrades went to the target area to measure the deviation of the bullet holes. When he returned to the observation post, he found that the jeep he had come in had been taken back by the battalion's cadres. It turned out that after the shooting ended, there were many tasks at home that needed to be urgently studied and arranged, so the battalion's cadres, in order to save time, took the jeep back first. At that moment, he felt uncomfortable. He thought: These comrades are not acting right, they don't respect me as the regimental commander, they took the car without a word. Just then, the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao resonated in his ears: "People's work is different, their positions are different, but no matter how high one's position, one must appear among the people as an ordinary laborer. It is not permissible to put on airs." He immediately realized that this was the rise of officialdom, the "self" at work. He thought: Due to work needs, the battalion's cadres taking the car back early is completely understandable. Why did I feel that others were not acting right? This was entirely the officialdom at work, the "self" at work in the brain, fearing that subordinates would not respect me, fearing that subordinates would treat me as an equal. This actually means to build a wall in one's mind, separating oneself from subordinates and from the masses.

    The more he thought about it, the more his face burned. A past incident flashed through his mind like a movie. In October 1948, after the army won the Jinxi Blockade Battle and then entered the pass, he was promoted to deputy political instructor of a company. At that time, he felt that his "position" had risen, and it was legitimate for the orderly to carry his backpack during the march. One day during the march, he encountered the division's Political Commissar Liu. Liu saw that his backpack was being carried by the orderly and said to him: "Lin Fuhuo, when you were a platoon leader, you could carry it yourself, why can't you carry it now that you are a deputy political instructor?" The commissar's words were heavy with meaning. He thought: When I was a platoon leader, I not only carried my own backpack but also helped the soldiers carry double rifles and rice bags. After just a few days as a deputy political instructor, my officialdom grew, and I lost the spirit of an ordinary soldier. He felt very sad. From then on, Comrade Lin Fuhuo carried his own backpack, crossing the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and fighting over six thousand miles, his backpack never leaving his shoulders.

    Now, Regimental Commander Lin was thinking: The matter of carrying the backpack is small, but it has worn away much of my officialdom and reduced the "self" in me, allowing me to maintain the spirit of an ordinary soldier and keep close ties with the masses. Now, because I didn't get to ride in the car, I am unhappy. Isn't this officialdom rearing its head again? With officialdom, one will inevitably become detached from the masses and deviate from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Thinking of this, it was like a bucket of cold water poured over his head, and he felt much more awake. At this moment, the jeep returned to pick him up. However, he happily let others ride in the car, and he returned to the camp with the soldiers in the big truck.

    Later, at the party committee meeting, Comrade Lin Fuhuo also brought up this fleeting thought of officialdom and asked everyone to criticize him.

### 狠斗自己的官气

    毛主席语录
    国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。
    团长林富和跟随部队去打靶，回来时，吉普车被别人坐走了，心里觉得不是滋味。经过一番思想斗争，他没有批评别人，而是：
    狠斗自己的官气
    团长林富和跟一个营去打靶。打完以后，他和几个同志到目标区测弹坑偏差量。当他回到观察所时，发现来时坐的吉普车被营的干部坐回去了。原来打靶结束以后，家里有许多工作要赶快研究、布置，营的干部为了抓紧时间，就把吉普车先坐回去了。当时他心里觉得不舒服。心想：这些同志不象话，眼里没有我这团长，不吭一声就把小车坐跑了。就在这时，伟大领袖毛主席的教导亲切地响在耳边：“人们的工作有所不同，职务有所不同，但是任何人不论官有多大，在人民中间都要以一个普通劳动者的姿态出现。决不许可摆架子。”他马上意识到，这是官气上升，是“私”字在作怪。他想：由于工作需要，营的干部提前坐车回去，是完全可以的。为什么自己觉得别人不象话？这完全是官气在起作用，是“私”字在脑子里起作用，唯恐下级不尊重自己，唯恐下级和自己平起平坐。这实际上是要从思想上筑起一堵墙，把自己和下级隔开，和群众隔开。
    他越想脸上越火辣辣的。过去的一件事象电影一样在脑子里映起来。一九四八年十月间，部队打完锦西阻击战，紧接着进关的时候，他被提为连的副指导员。当时觉得“官”大了，行军的时候，背包叫挑勤员挑着是合法的。有一天行军，碰到师的刘政委，刘政委看见他的背包叫挑勤员挑着，就对他说：“林富和，你当排长的时候，可以自己背，为什么当了副指导员就背不动了？”政委的话语重心长，字字有分量。他想：自己当排长的时候，不光背自己的背包，还帮助战士扛双枪，背米袋子。刚当几天副指导员，就官升脾气长，把普通一兵的本色也丢了。心里很难过。从那以后，林富和同志就自己背上了背包，跨黄河，过长江，转战六千多里，背包再没有离开自己的双肩。
    现在，林团长就在想：背背包的事情虽小，却把自己的官气磨去了不少，“私”字打掉了不少，使自己保持了普通一兵的本色，和群众保持了密切联系。现在，为了自己没坐上车就不高兴，这不是官气又露头了吗？有了官气，就必然会脱离群众，背离毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。想到这里，就象迎头泼了一瓢凉水，他觉得清醒了许多。这时，吉普车又返回来接他。他却乐呵呵地把小车让给别人坐，自己和战士一起坐着大车返回营房。
    后来，在党委会上，林富和同志还把自己这一闪念的官气亮出来叫大家批评。
