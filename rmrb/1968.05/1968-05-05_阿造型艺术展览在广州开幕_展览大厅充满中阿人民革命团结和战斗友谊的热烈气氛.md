The exhibition of Albanian fine arts opened in Guangzhou on April 30.

Revolutionary committee members of Guangzhou, relevant departments, soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary masses attended the opening ceremony.

Albanian Ambassador to China, Natanaili, came from Beijing to Guangzhou to attend the opening ceremony.

The exhibition hall was filled with a fervent atmosphere of revolutionary solidarity and combat friendship between the peoples of China and Albania. Above the hall, the national flags of China and Albania were flying. At the entrance, there stood statues of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great leader of the Albanian people and close comrade of the Chinese people, Enver Hoxha. A large banner reading "Long Live the Revolutionary Solidarity and Combat Friendship Between the Two Parties and Two Peoples of China and Albania" was hung high. Around the walls of the hall, there were also large red boards with quotations from Chairman Mao and Enver Hoxha.

Over one hundred pieces of sculptures, oil paintings, propaganda posters, prints, and cartoons were on display. These works enthusiastically praised the wise leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by Enver Hoxha, expressed the Albanian people's boundless love for their great leader, reflected the heroic spirit of the Albanian people in their anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle, and showcased their great achievements under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party and Enver Hoxha on the path of revolution. These works also vividly praised Chinese workers, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and Red Guards.

The Albanian artists once again wrote a new ode to the unbreakable combat friendship between the peoples of China and Albania.

Invited to attend the opening ceremony were Le Cong, Consul of the Vietnamese Consulate in Guangzhou, representatives of foreign institutions in Guangzhou, Japanese friend Nishisonji Koichi, and foreign friends who were visiting and participating in the China Export Commodities Fair in Guangzhou.
