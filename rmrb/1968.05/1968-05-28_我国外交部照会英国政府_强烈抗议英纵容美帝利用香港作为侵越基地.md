	Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Protests to the British Government for Allowing the U.S. to Use Hong Kong as a Base for Aggression Against Vietnam

	The British Government Must Immediately Order the U.S. Nuclear-Powered Aircraft Carrier "Enterprise" to Leave Hong Kong. If the British Government Continues to Be Obstinate, It Will Surely Reap What It Sows

	New China News Agency, May 27th: Tonight, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Luo Guibo, summoned the British Chargé d'Affaires, Hopkinson, and handed him a note from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The note strongly protests to the British Government regarding the U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Enterprise" entering Hong Kong and the British Government's connivance in the U.S. imperialists using Hong Kong as a base for aggression against the Vietnam War. It sternly demands that the British Government immediately order the "Enterprise" to leave Hong Kong and stop providing Hong Kong to the U.S. imperialists as a base and logistics supply base for their aggression against the Vietnam War.

	The note states that recently, while the U.S. government is intensifying its aggression in Vietnam, U.S. warships directly participating in the aggression against Vietnam have been frequently entering and leaving Hong Kong, conducting various activities. On May 24th, the U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Enterprise," which is seen as a "plague" by the people of Asia, along with a batch of ships from the U.S. Seventh Fleet that participated in the war at sea in Vietnam, entered Hong Kong after participating in the war at sea in Vietnam. In less than five months this year, various types of U.S. ships that have entered Hong Kong have reached 146 times, including four nuclear-powered ships.

	The note points out that the British Government, disregarding the repeated serious protests of the Chinese Government and the strong opposition of the Chinese residents of Hong Kong, has been increasingly conniving in the entry and exit of U.S. aggression ships in Hong Kong, conducting various activities. It has become increasingly blatant in providing Hong Kong to the U.S. as a base and logistics supply station for its naval and air forces in the aggression against Vietnam. It has even used Hong Kong as a base for U.S. nuclear-powered ships. This not only fully exposes the British Government's role as an accomplice in the U.S. aggression against Vietnam but also increasingly seriously endangers China's security and directly poses a serious threat to the safety of the lives of Chinese residents in Hong Kong. The British Government's evil deeds are a serious provocation to the Chinese people, the Vietnamese people, and the people of Southeast Asia. For this, the Chinese Government once again strongly protests to the British Government.

	The note further points out that since last May, the British Government has carried out large-scale suppression and persecution against the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, owing a blood debt to the Chinese people. Old accounts are not settled, and now it is colluding with U.S. aggressors to provoke new challenges against the Chinese people and the Chinese residents of Hong Kong. This only shows that the British Government's so-called willingness to ease the situation in Hong Kong and improve Sino-British relations is false, while stubbornly implementing the reactionary policy of hostility towards the Chinese people is true. The British Government's actions will only further deteriorate the situation in Hong Kong and Sino-British relations. This responsibility must be fully borne by the British Government.

	The note finally sternly demands: The British Government must immediately order the U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Enterprise" to leave Hong Kong and must stop providing Hong Kong to the U.S. as a base and logistics supply base for the aggression against the Vietnam War. If the British Government continues to be obstinate and stubbornly follows the U.S. government's policy of aggression and war, aiding and abetting the aggressors, and becoming an enemy of the Chinese people, the Vietnamese people, and the people of Southeast Asia, it will surely reap what it sows.

    我国外交部照会英国政府
    强烈抗议英纵容美帝利用香港作为侵越基地
    英国政府必须立即着令美国核动力航空母舰“企业号”离开香港。如果英国政府继续执迷不悟，必将自食其果
    新华社二十七日讯　中华人民共和国外交部副部长罗贵波今晚召见英国驻华代办霍普森，交给他我国外交部的一份照会，就美国核动力航空母舰“企业号”开进香港，和英国政府纵容美帝国主义利用香港作为侵略越南战争的活动基地，向英国政府提出强烈抗议，严正要求英国政府立即着令“企业号”离开香港，停止继续把香港提供给美帝国主义作为侵略越南战争的活动基地和后勤补给基地。
    照会说，最近以来，正当美国政府在越南强化侵略战争之时，直接参加侵略越南战争的美国军舰更加频繁地进出香港，利用香港进行一系列活动。五月二十四日，被亚洲人民视为“瘟神”的美国核动力航空母舰“企业号”连同一批第七舰队侵略舰只，又在参加越南海面作战之后开进香港。今年不到五个月时间内，开到香港的美国各式舰只达到一百四十六艘次，其中核动力舰只已达四艘。
    照会指出，英国政府不顾中国政府的多次严正抗议，不顾香港中国居民的强烈反对，变本加厉地纵容美帝侵略军舰进出香港，进行各种活动，更加露骨地把香港提供给美帝作为它侵略越南海、空军的活动基地和后勤补给站，甚至把香港作为美国核动力军舰的活动基地，这不但充分暴露了英国政府充当美国侵略越南的帮凶，而且越来越严重地危害到中国的安全，并直接对香港中国居民生命的安全构成了严重的威胁。英国政府这种罪恶行径是对中国人民、越南人民和东南亚人民的严重挑衅。为此，中国政府再一次向英国政府提出强烈抗议。
    照会接着指出，去年五月以来，英国政府对我香港爱国同胞进行了大规模的镇压和迫害，对中国人民欠下了一笔血债，旧帐未了，现在又勾结美国侵略者对中国人民和香港中国居民进行新的挑衅，这只能说明英国政府口头上所说的愿意缓和香港局势和改善中英关系是假的，而顽固地执行敌视中国人民的反动政策是真的。英国政府这样做，只会使香港局势和中英关系进一步恶化。这个责任必须完全由英国政府承担。
    照会最后严正要求：英国政府必须立即着令美国核动力航空母舰“企业号”离开香港，必须停止继续把香港提供给美帝作为侵略越南战争的活动基地和后勤补给基地。如果英国政府继续执迷不悟，死心塌地追随美国政府的侵略政策和战争政策，助纣为虐，与中国人民、越南人民和东南亚人民为敌到底，那就必将自食其果。
