	Unwavering Loyalty to Chairman Mao: Unshakable Spirit at the Moment of Life and Death
	Class Leader Zhang Manyuan, Fourth Platoon, a Certain Unit of the People's Liberation Army

	My sister's husband, Comrade Men He, sacrificed his life to protect the safety of twenty-seven class brothers and sisters. He died a glorious death.

	Great Leader Chairman Mao said: "To die for the people's interests is weightier than Mount Tai." Comrade Men He's death is weightier than Mount Tai.

	Comrade Men He and I live in the same village. The deepest impression he left on me was his most sincere, profound, and pure proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao. He often said: "The heavens and the earth are vast, but nothing is greater than Chairman Mao's grace; parents are dear, but nothing is dearer than Chairman Mao." "Without Chairman Mao, there would be no Men He; without Chairman Mao, there would be no liberation for the laboring masses across the land!" From the day he joined the revolution, for twenty years, he never forgot the bitterness of the old society, and he never forgot Chairman Mao's grace. Every time he returned home on leave, he would eat bitter food with us and recall the hardships of his life working for the landlord in the old society. He often told us: "Never forget that we are poor and lower-middle peasants. In the old society, we were like cattle and horses. It was Chairman Mao who rescued us from the sea of bitterness and made us masters of the state. We must never forget our class bitterness from generation to generation and never forget Chairman Mao's grace. To forget the past is to forget our roots, to forget Chairman Mao."

	Comrade Men He had only Chairman Mao in his heart. On the first page of each of his diaries, he wrote: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live! Long live!" When his children first learned to speak, the first words he taught them were "Long live Chairman Mao!" When our children put on new cotton clothes, the first thing he told them was "Never forget Chairman Mao after liberation!" When I was young, the first song he taught me was the loudest song in the world, "The East Is Red"; when I enlisted, the first gift he gave me was the brilliant works of Chairman Mao, and the first thing he told me was "Follow Chairman Mao to the end of the revolution!" After enlisting, the first letter he sent me asked, "We must be good soldiers of Chairman Mao!"

	Throughout Comrade Men He's brilliant life, he consistently regarded studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as his first need in life. He often told me: "Chairman Mao's works must be studied every day. One day without study brings many problems, two days without study leads to decline, three days without study makes it impossible to live." Every time he returned home on leave, I saw him eagerly studying Chairman Mao's works. Every morning, he would go to the village's reservoir dam to greet the eastern dawn, concentrating on reading Chairman Mao's books. Once, during mealtime, he hadn't returned home yet, so my sister asked me to find him. I found him at the reservoir dam, still deeply engrossed in reading. I walked up to him, but he didn't notice me. When I asked him what book he was reading, he turned his head and said, "Chairman Mao's book. This is the lifeline of us poor and lower-middle peasants; we can't be without it for a moment."

	"Regarding Marxist theory, one must master it and apply it; the purpose of mastery is entirely for application." Comrade Men He firmly remembered the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings, showing unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, learning and applying it. In this regard, what I will never forget is his help to me on many occasions. In March 1965, when I enlisted, he happened to be home on leave. At that time, I really wanted to go with him to the same place, but he said no. He enlightened me: "We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, go where needed. Chairman Mao has given us the gun, and no matter where we go, we are fighting to defend the proletarian dictatorship!"

	Last year, when I was on military training duty at Beijing No. 125 Middle School, he sent me letters multiple times, urging me to "firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great directive to 'support the broad masses of the left,' in the class struggle, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, while firing at China's Khrushchev and other cliques of capitalist roaders within the party, temper yourself to be loyal to Chairman Mao, and become a steadfast soldier defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" From Comrade Men He's repeated help to me, I saw his heart, which is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao! His brilliant image will forever inspire me to follow Chairman Mao and keep moving forward.

	Chairman Mao repeatedly taught us: "Never forget class struggle." Comrade Men He firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings. In 1961, when the black wind of "three freedoms and one contract" pushed by China's Khrushchev blew into our village, it happened that Comrade Men He was home on leave. He immediately saw that this was the class enemy causing trouble, dismantling the socialist stage, and pulling us poor and lower-middle peasants back. He immediately joined the poor and lower-middle peasants in the village to recall bitterness and sweetness, to study Chairman Mao's great teachings that "only socialism can save China," and to angrily expose the enemy's evil plot to restore capitalism. He spoke earnestly: "We poor and lower-middle peasants suffered in the past because of private ownership, because of individual farming. Chairman Mao led us to take the collective path, precisely to uproot this bitterness! We must never forget class struggle and must always follow Chairman Mao to walk the socialist path!" In this way, the poor and lower-middle peasants in our village, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, withstood the evil wind of "three freedoms and one contract" and repelled the class enemy's attack.

	Comrade Men He, with a high sense of political responsibility, "always stands guard and fights for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." Last year, he sent my sister home to give birth, but considering that he was on the front line of "three supports and two militaries," fighting to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, he only stayed home for one night before returning to his unit. At that time, the villagers repeatedly urged him to stay a few more days to take care of my sister, but he politely declined. He said: "The current class struggle is intense, and I can't put my heart at ease even if I leave the battlefield defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for a day!"

	Comrade Men He's infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao, his active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, is also prominently reflected in his consistent closeness to the masses and his maintenance of the character of the working people. Every time he returned home on leave, he always wore faded, patched military uniforms, and as soon as he arrived, he worked in the fields with the commune members. The commune members said: "Old Men, you've come all this way, you should rest a bit!" He said: "Labor is the character of us poor and lower-middle peasants. If we leave labor, we will become detached from the masses and become revisionists!"

	Although Hero Men He has bid us farewell forever, his brilliant example of infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao, infinite loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line will forever live in my heart and forever live in the hearts of all the people of China!

    无限忠于毛主席　生死关头志不移
    人民解放军某部四连班长　张满元
    门合同志是我的姐夫，为保护二十七位阶级兄弟的生命安全，光荣地牺牲了。
    伟大领袖毛主席说：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”。门合同志的死，是比泰山还重的。
    门合同志和我住在一个村。他给我最深刻的印象，是他对毛主席怀有最真挚、最深厚、最纯洁的无产阶级感情。他常说：“天大地大，没有毛主席的恩情大；爹亲娘亲，没有毛主席亲。”“没有毛主席，就没有我门合；没有毛主席，就没有普天下劳动人民的解放！”他从参加革命那天起，二十年如一日，时刻不忘旧社会的苦，时刻不忘毛主席的恩情。他每次回家探亲，都要和我们一起吃忆苦饭，回忆他在旧社会给地主扛长活的苦难生活。他常对我们说：“千万不要忘记咱们是贫下中农，在旧社会里是牛马。是毛主席他老人家把咱们从苦海里救了出来，才成了国家的主人。咱们要祖祖辈辈不忘阶级苦，世世代代不忘毛主席的恩情。忘记过去，就是忘本，就是忘了毛主席。”
    门合同志心中唯有毛主席。在他的每个日记本上，第一页都写着“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”他的孩子刚学说话的时候，他教的第一句话是“毛主席万岁！”当我们家的孩子们穿上新棉衣时，他嘱咐的第一句话是“翻身不忘毛主席！”我小时候，他教我唱的第一支歌是世界上最响亮的歌《东方红》；我入伍时，他送给我的第一件礼物是光辉的毛主席著作，他嘱咐我的第一句话是“永远跟着毛主席革命到底！”入伍后，他给我寄的第一封信的要求是“我们要做毛主席的好战士！”
    在门合同志光辉的一生中，一贯把活学活用毛主席著作当作自己生活的第一需要。他常对我说：“毛主席著作要天天学，一天不学问题多，两天不学走下坡，三天不学没法活。”他每次回家探亲，我都看到他如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作的动人情景。每天早起，他都要到村外水库坝上迎着东方的曙光，聚精会神地读毛主席的书。有一次，吃饭的时候他还没回家，姐姐叫我去找他。我找到水库坝上，就见他还在精心地读，我走到他身边他还不知道。当我问他读的什么书时，他才回过头来说：“毛主席的书。这是咱贫下中农的命根子，一时一刻也不能离开它。”
    “对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”门合同志牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导，对毛泽东思想无限忠诚，学了就用。在这方面，使我永远难忘的是他多次对我的帮助。一九六五年三月我入伍时，他正好回家探亲。当时，我一心想跟他到一个地方去，他说不行。他开导我说：“咱们一定要听毛主席的话，哪里需要到哪里去。毛主席把枪杆子交给咱们，不管到哪里，都是为保卫无产阶级政权而战斗！”
    去年上半年，我在北京一二五中学执行军训任务，他又多次给我来信，要我“坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，坚决执行毛主席‘人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众’的伟大指示，在阶级斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，在向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派开火的同时，锤炼自己忠于毛主席的红心，做誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线的坚强战士！”从门合同志一次又一次对我的帮助中，我看到了他那颗无限忠于毛主席的红心！他那光辉的形象，永远激励着我紧跟毛主席不断前进。
    毛主席一再教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”门合同志牢牢记住毛主席的这一教导。一九六一年，当中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“三自一包”的黑风刮到我们村上时，正赶上门合同志回来探亲。他一眼就看出，这是阶级敌人在捣鬼，拆社会主义的台，拉我们贫下中农走回头路。他立即同村里贫下中农一起忆苦思甜，一起学习毛主席“只有社会主义能够救中国”的伟大教导，愤怒揭露敌人企图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。他语重心长说：“咱贫下中农过去苦就苦在私有制上，苦在单干上。毛主席领导咱们走集体化道路，就是为了拔掉这个苦根子！咱们万万不能忘记阶级斗争，要永远跟着毛主席走社会主义道路！”就这样，我们村的贫下中农靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，顶住了“三自一包”的妖风，击退了阶级敌人的进攻。
    门合同志以高度的政治责任感，“时刻为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗”。去年，他送我姐姐回家生孩子，他考虑到自己在“三支”“两军”第一线，为捍卫毛主席革命路线而战斗，仅在家住了一个晚上就归队了。当时乡亲们再三劝他多住几天照顾我姐姐，都被他婉言谢绝了。他说：“当前阶级斗争很激烈，我一天离开捍卫毛主席革命路线的战斗岗位也放不下心啊！”
    门合同志无限忠于毛主席，活学活用毛泽东思想，还突出地表现在他一贯密切联系群众，保持劳动人民的本色上。他每次回家探亲总是穿着褪了色的带补钉的军装，一到家就和社员们一起下地干活。社员们说：“老门，你老远回来一趟，也该好好休息休息呀！”他说：“劳动是咱们贫下中农的本色。离开了劳动，就会脱离群众，就会变修啊！”
    英雄门合同志虽然和我们永别了，但是他那无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的光辉榜样，却永远活在我的心里，永远活在全中国人民的心里！
