Our great leader Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the epoch-making and brilliant document, the "Notice," which has been issued for two years. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Qingdao, Unit 6037, in the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution in human history, has armed itself and the masses with the brilliant "Notice," achieving one great victory after another. During the "January Revolution" storm, we firmly supported the proletarian revolutionary faction, seized back the power usurped by a handful of capitalist roaders within the old Qingdao Municipal Committee, and established the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee. After supporting the proletarian revolutionary faction in seizing power, we firmly remember the great teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao: "Never forget class struggle, the fundamental question of the revolution is the question of power." Under the brilliant guidance of the "Notice," we fought shoulder to shoulder with the proletarian revolutionary faction, the Red Guard revolutionary youngsters, the broad revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres, actively and unceasingly launching attacks on the enemies of the proletariat. In the fierce class struggle, we consolidated the newly established revolutionary power.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, how can we continuously consolidate and develop it, and firmly grasp the destiny of the proletarian dictatorship in our own hands? This is a major question we face. Through studying the "Notice" and Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle, and analyzing the class struggle situation in Qingdao, we deeply understand that after the victory of the power struggle, the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads is still fiercely ongoing, and the focus of the struggle is still centered around the issue of power. If we relax our struggle against the class enemies, there is the danger of losing power. Therefore, after the proletarian revolutionary faction wins the power struggle, we must fully utilize the power seized by the proletariat to organize and lead the broad revolutionary masses to attack the handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and all counter-revolutionaries! Attack! Attack! Attack again! Only in this way can we consolidate and develop the newly established revolutionary power.

Over the past year, under the brilliant guidance of the "Notice," we have fought shoulder to shoulder with the broad revolutionary masses, actively and unceasingly launching powerful offensives against the class enemies, repeatedly foiling their evil plots to overthrow the newly established revolutionary power.

Last March, shortly after the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee was established, the handful of capitalist roaders within the Qingdao Municipal Party who had been overthrown were unwilling to accept their demise. They exploited some shortcomings in the work of the newly established revolutionary committee, deceived some uninformed masses, and stormed the organs of proletarian dictatorship, attempting to strangle the newly established revolutionary power in its cradle. At this critical moment, we used the "Notice" as a sharp ideological weapon, timely detected the movements of the class enemies, and as soon as the enemies appeared on stage, we, together with the broad revolutionary masses, dealt a heavy blow to the class enemies, defending the newly established revolutionary power.

As the proletarian revolutionary ranks grew stronger and the newly established revolutionary power became more consolidated, the class enemies changed their counter-revolutionary tactics. They used the tactic of Sun Wukong's heart-digging, played the role of counter-revolutionary two-faced characters, disguised themselves, and desperately tried to infiltrate the "heart" of the newly established revolutionary committee, forming factions, gathering troops, attempting to split the revolutionary committee, and turn proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship. At this time, we again used the keen-eyed "Notice" to quickly identify the new trends and new characteristics of the class struggle, immediately supporting the proletarian revolutionary faction to expose the conspirators, ambitious schemers, and counter-revolutionary two-faced characters who had infiltrated the revolutionary ranks.

The closer the proletarian cultural revolution is to achieving comprehensive victory, the more fiercely the class enemies struggle to their death. Recently, a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and counter-revolutionaries have again stirred up a rightist reversal wind. They shamelessly shouted, "I am not a capitalist roader, I cannot be overthrown." They attempted to negate the "January Revolution" storm, to reverse the verdict on the bourgeois reactionary line, and once again directed the counter-revolutionary spearhead at the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee. In this struggle between restoration and anti-restoration, reversal and anti-reversal, we, the support-to-the-left personnel, have always stood on the frontline of class struggle, day and night with the broad revolutionary masses, extensively and deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle, striking down the rightist reversal wind.

In the struggle to defend the newly established revolutionary power over the past year, we deeply felt that the great "Notice" is not only a powerful ideological weapon for us proletarians to seize power but also a powerful ideological weapon to consolidate and develop this power after seizing it.

The basic spirit of the brilliant "Notice" is to mobilize the masses, organize a vast proletarian revolutionary army, and launch attacks on the enemies of the proletariat. We have understood from the "Notice" that organizing a vast proletarian revolutionary army is a need for fighting against the enemy, a need for consolidating the newly established revolutionary power, and a need for achieving comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution. With a proletarian revolutionary army, we can isolate the enemy to the greatest extent and strike the enemy with the heaviest blows.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The working class has the farthest vision, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution." Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, we actively maintain and give full play to the leading role and main force role of the working class. In April last year, soon after the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Workers' Headquarters was established, we dispatched personnel to participate in their work. Now, the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Workers' Headquarters has become a revolutionary army of tens of thousands of people. This is a revolutionary army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, capable of influencing the entire situation in Qingdao.

The class enemies, in order to deliberately muddy the waters, confuse the class lines, and shift the target of struggle, have used every means to split the revolutionary ranks. Therefore, in the entire support-to-the-left work, we have paid great attention to distinguishing class boundaries, strictly differentiating between the two types of contradictions, uniting all possible masses, and always directing the spearhead of struggle at the handful of class enemies. Over the past year, Qingdao has experienced multiple reversals in the proletarian cultural revolution. In each reversal, a part of the masses, due to being deceived and utilized by the class enemies, said wrong things, did wrong things, and stood on the wrong side. For these comrades, we mainly carried out in-depth and detailed ideological and political work, helping them to consciously recognize and correct their mistakes, and draw a clear line with the enemy. At the same time, we actively did ideological and political work among the revolutionary mass organizations, urging them to unite all possible people, win revolutionary allies, and fight against the common class enemies. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, now, 95% of the units in the city have achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination.

    捍卫新生的革命委员会
    人民解放军驻青岛六○三七部队
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的划时代的光辉文献《通知》发出两年来，人民解放军驻青岛六○三七部队，在人类历史上没有先例的无产阶级文化大革命中，用光辉的《通知》武装自己，武装群众，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。在“一月革命”风暴中，我们坚决支持无产阶级革命派，夺回了被旧青岛市委内一小撮走资派所窃据的大权，成立了青岛市革命委员会。在支持无产阶级革命派夺权胜利后，我们牢记伟大领袖毛主席千万不要忘记阶级斗争、革命的根本问题是政权问题的伟大教导，在《通知》精神的光辉照耀下，和无产阶级革命派、红卫兵革命小将、广大革命群众和革命干部并肩战斗，主动地、不停顿地向无产阶级的敌人发起进攻，在激烈的阶级斗争中巩固了新生的革命政权。
    革命委员会成立以后，怎样才能不断巩固和发展，把无产阶级专政的命运牢牢掌握在自己手里？这是我们面临的一个重大问题。通过学习《通知》和毛主席关于阶级斗争的教导，分析青岛市的阶级斗争形势，我们深刻认识到：夺权斗争取得胜利后，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，仍然在激烈地进行着，而斗争的焦点，还是紧紧围绕着政权问题。如果我们放松了对阶级敌人进行斗争，就有丧失政权的危险。因此，在无产阶级革命派取得夺权斗争胜利后，就要充分运用无产阶级夺来的权力，组织和带领广大革命群众，向一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和一切反革命分子进攻！进攻！再进攻！只有这样，才能巩固、发展新生的革命政权。
    一年多来，我们在《通知》的光辉照耀下，和广大革命群众并肩战斗，主动地、不停顿地向阶级敌人发起强大的攻势，一次又一次地粉碎了敌人妄图颠覆新生的革命政权的罪恶阴谋。
    去年三月，青岛市革命委员会刚刚成立不久，被打倒了的青岛市党内一小撮走资派不甘心于自己的灭亡，就利用新生的革命委员会工作中的个别缺点，蒙蔽了一些不明真相的群众，冲击无产阶级专政机关，妄图把新生的革命政权扼杀在摇篮里。就在这个时候，我们用《通知》这个锐利的思想武器，及时察觉了阶级敌人的动向，当敌人刚一登台表演时，就和广大革命群众一起，给了阶级敌人以沉重的打击，捍卫了新生的革命政权。
    随着无产阶级革命队伍的日益壮大，新生的革命政权日益巩固，阶级敌人又改变了他们的反革命策略。他们采用孙悟空的挖心战术，玩弄反革命两面派的手法，乔装打扮，削尖脑袋，拚命钻到新生的革命委员会的“肝脏”里来，立山头，拉队伍，妄图分裂革命委员会，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。这时我们又用明察秋毫的《通知》一照，很快认清了阶级斗争的新动向、新特点，马上支持无产阶级革命派，把钻进革命队伍内部的阴谋家、野心家、反革命两面派揪了出来。
    无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，阶级敌人越要进行垂死挣扎。最近以来，一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和反革命分子，又刮起了一股右倾翻案妖风。他们恬不知耻地叫嚷：“我不是走资派，打不倒。”他们妄图否定“一月革命”风暴，为资产阶级反动路线翻案，又一次把反革命的矛头指向青岛市革命委员会。在这场复辟和反复辟、翻案和反翻案的斗争中，我们支左人员始终站在阶级斗争第一线，日日夜夜和广大革命群众一起，广泛而深入地开展革命大批判，痛击右倾翻案妖风。
    在一年多来捍卫新生的革命政权的斗争中，我们深深体会到，伟大的《通知》不仅是我们无产阶级夺取政权的强大思想武器，而且是在夺取政权以后，巩固和发展这个政权的强大思想武器。
    光芒四射的《通知》的基本精神，就是要放手发动群众，组织一支浩浩荡荡的无产阶级革命大军，向无产阶级的敌人发起进攻。我们从《通知》中领悟到，组织起一支浩浩荡荡的无产阶级革命大军，是对敌斗争的需要，是巩固新生的革命政权的需要，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的需要。有了一支无产阶级革命大军，就能最大限度地孤立敌人，最沉重地打击敌人。
    毛主席教导我们：“工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”我们根据毛主席的教导，积极维护和发挥工人阶级的领导作用和主力军作用。去年四月，青岛市革命职工总司令部成立不久，我们就派出人员参加他们的工作。现在，青岛市革命职工总司令部已经是一支拥有数十万人的革命大军。 这是一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的、能够左右整个青岛形势的革命大军。
    阶级敌人为了故意把水搅浑，混淆阶级阵线，转移斗争目标，曾经千方百计地分裂革命队伍。因此，我们在整个支左工作中，非常注意划清阶级界限，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的群众，始终把斗争的矛头指向一小撮阶级敌人。一年多来，青岛市在无产阶级文化大革命中曾出现了多次反复。在每次反复中，都有一部分群众由于受了阶级敌人的蒙蔽和利用，说了错话，做了错事，站错了队。对于这些同志，我们主要是进行深入细致的思想政治工作，启发他们自觉地认识错误，改正错误，和敌人划清界限。同时，我们还主动向革命群众组织做思想政治工作，要他们团结一切可以团结的人，争取革命同盟军，向共同的阶级敌人进行斗争。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，现在，全市已有百分之九十五的单位实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
