Fighting on the side of Chairman Mao, with the glorious revolutionary tradition of "February 7," the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau, under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong and with the enthusiastic help of the People's Liberation Army, have a heart full of loyalty to the great leader Mao Zedong. In the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, they stand against the evil winds and fight against the evil waves, defending Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line with practical actions. They regard the railway as the blood vessels of the socialist motherland, proposing slogans such as "People are on the train, people are on the line," and "Let every line connect Beijing and the people of the whole country tightly." They ensure that the thousand-mile railway around Chairman Mao is unobstructed.

The Red Sun Illuminates the Train

"Revolutionary spring is endless, and the production tide is surging." The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Railway, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," have never had such high revolutionary enthusiasm, and the production and transportation tasks are completed better month by month.

For a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents on the railway have implemented a counter-revolutionary revisionist line, vigorously opposing the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought at stations and on trains, and spreading the black wind of capitalist restoration.

Now, the stations and trains of the Beijing Railway Bureau have completely changed. The workers put the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought in the first place. They fill the stations and trains with the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought. After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" and to hold study classes, they acted immediately, setting up passenger study classes. The staff took the lead in implementing the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao, fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism with the passengers. They are not only service personnel but also propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought; they are not only organizers of study classes but also participants. In the past, passengers in the carriages either played cards, read comic books, or chatted idly. Now, everyone in the carriages studies the works of Chairman Mao, reads newspapers, discusses politics, and cares about state affairs, creating a new atmosphere everywhere.

The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau, in their transportation work, follow the spirit of Chairman Mao's teachings of "extreme responsibility to work, extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people," and do everything possible to serve the brother units and industrial and agricultural production. To ensure the supply of coal for industrial and agricultural production and people's livelihood, the entire bureau regards coal transportation as a key task, meeting the needs of the mines to the greatest extent, ensuring priority allocation and transportation, and transporting as much as produced. In mid-April, the Chengde Steel Plant urgently needed the raw material white marble for steelmaking and requested the railway to help solve the problem. The planning, dispatching, and revolutionary workers of the Panjiadian Station of the bureau worked together to immediately transport five cars of white marble to the factory.

Since this year, the stations of Shunyi, Nanyuan, Huangtupo, and Liangxiang in the Beijing Bureau have had a large number of paper-making raw materials that need to be transported out. Since paper-making raw materials are light and bulky, more vehicles are needed for loading, and they are flammable materials that require a large amount of tarpaulin to cover, making it relatively difficult. However, the revolutionary workers of the station, hearing that this is the raw material for publishing the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," were full of enthusiasm and doubled their efforts, coming up with many solutions, overcoming difficulties, and improving the loading methods. In the past, paper-making raw materials were often transported in a circular manner, causing a waste of transport capacity. This time, they proactively suggested to the relevant departments to adjust the supply lines, achieving rational transportation. Since this year, the bureau has transported more than 2,500 cars of paper-making raw materials, ensuring the needs of the paper mills and honorably completing this political task.

The More Difficult the Place, the More We Must Go

The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau realize that fighting against the sabotage of class enemies in the struggle to grasp revolution and promote production, and ensuring the smooth operation of railway transportation, is an important aspect of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They jointly proposed: "We must do a good job in railway transportation and make Chairman Mao proud." Workers take on difficulties, shoulder heavy burdens, and everyone is spirited and full of fighting spirit. On March 11, the 205th passenger train from Beijing to Zhengzhou had some crew members who could not report for duty. The dispatching room of the bureau heard the news and immediately offered support, saying: "We will do it! We will not let the passenger train be delayed by even one minute!" The bureau office heard the news and also offered to support, saying: "The dispatching room has been working all night and must ensure they get enough rest." They volunteered to be crew members, ensuring that the 205th passenger train departed on schedule.

For a period, the Fengtai Locomotive Depot had a shortage of crew members. The crew members of the famous "Mao Zedong" locomotive group, during their days off, always volunteered to take over shifts. They were on call in the dispatching room, ready to go at any time. Once, when the locomotive went to the factory for maintenance, Deputy Driver Gao Junting took over shifts on other locomotives for half a month. Driver Long Cai Lianxing also well practiced the spirit of communist cooperation.

The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "promoting the overall situation," are on the railway but have the country in their hearts, treating others' tasks as their own and others' difficulties as their own. When the internal transportation of brother enterprises is tense, they send railway shunting locomotives into the factory to help move vehicles and overcome difficulties. The revolutionary workers of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, in the face of very busy tasks in their own section, prepared five of the best locomotives and sixty crew members, fully equipped and ready, awaiting the orders of the leading organs, ready to support brother units at any time.

For the Revolution, Sweat More

In the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution's victory, a small handful of capitalist roaders within the Beijing Railway Bureau and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists attempted to struggle desperately, spreading a whirlwind of anarchism.

The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau, in the fierce struggle against class enemies and anarchism, have only one red sun in their hearts. They realize that "grasp revolution, promote production" is Chairman Mao's great policy. Can they guard their production posts, voluntarily observe revolutionary discipline, and ensure that the railway transportation around the great leader Mao Zedong in Beijing is unobstructed? This is the touchstone of whether they listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow Chairman Mao's instructions, and are loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Everyone, with Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, firmly opposes anarchism, exposes the troublemakers, and resists this evil wind.

Now, in the Beijing Railway Bureau, whether in stations, freight yards, workshops, work areas, locomotive and car groups, or train crews, the vast majority of workers can guard their production posts and voluntarily observe labor discipline. Some workers have proposed the battle slogan of "red hearts towards Chairman Mao, forever as the engine of the revolution, insisting on production without relaxation, rushing to where there are difficulties." Everywhere is a vibrant atmosphere. Some old drivers at the Xizhimen Locomotive Repair Depot work during the day and rest in the duty room at night, filling in wherever there is a shortage. Some young crew members influenced by anarchist thinking, with the help of the left-supporting PLA comrades and under the influence of old workers, realized that they had been deceived by class enemies. They exposed the enemies' plots and fought their selfishness, expressing their determination to guard their posts and obey assignments. The workers of the Fengtai Hub Station have an attendance rate of over 90%. Many locomotive groups, to speed up the turnover of vehicles and goods, think of ways to pull faster. Many workers, with the two "extremes" as a mirror, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, are loyal to their duties, insist on principles, and safeguard the people's interests.

"To save coal, sweat more for the revolution," the Beijing railway workers also launched a coal-saving campaign. The construction-type 5316 locomotive crew of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot saved 126 tons of coal in January this year and created a new record of saving 162 tons of coal in February. The coal consumption per ten thousand kilometers of the locomotive is 19.8% lower than the actual consumption in the same period last year. Currently, the Fengtai Locomotive Depot has launched a revolutionary competition to be the engine of the revolution and save coal for the revolution, with new coal-saving records being continuously broken.

Material conservation is important, but time conservation is even more important. The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Railway Bureau, with a red heart, race against time with the spirit of "seizing the day." The loading workers at the Xizhimen Station cherish every minute for the revolution and work to the second. In the past, it took two hours to unload a car of 60 tons of goods, but now it takes only one hour. The railway workers of Beijing, with their actual actions, are implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production."

    红心永向毛主席  永当革命的火车头
    ——记北京铁路分局革命职工抓革命促生产的事迹
    战斗在毛主席身旁、具有“二七”光荣革命传统的北京铁路分局广大革命职工，在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，在人民解放军的热情帮助下，对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，顶邪风，战恶浪，以实际行动捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们把铁路看作社会主义祖国的血管，提出了“人在列车在，人在线路通”，“让条条线路把北京和全国人民紧紧联在一起”等豪迈口号，使毛主席身旁的千里铁路畅通无阻。
    红太阳照亮了列车
    “革命春光无限好，生产热潮逐浪高”。经过无产阶级文化大革命锤炼的北京铁路革命职工，在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针指引下，革命干劲从来没有象今天这样高涨，生产运输任务也完成得一个月比一个月好。
    长期以来，中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在铁路上的代理人，推行了一条反革命修正主义路线，在车站和列车上竭力反对宣传毛泽东思想，大刮资本主义复辟的黑风。
    现在，北京铁路分局的车站和列车上已经完全变样了，职工们把大力宣传毛泽东思想放在首位，他们使车站和列车充满了毛泽东思想的阳光。毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”和大办学习班的伟大号召以后，他们闻风而动，办起了旅客学习班，工作人员带头贯彻毛主席提倡的革命好学风，同旅客一起斗私批修，既是服务员，又是毛泽东思想的宣传员；既是学习班的组织者，又是学习班的学员。过去，旅客们在车厢里不是打扑克，就是看小人书，闲聊天。现在车厢里人人学习毛主席著作，读报纸，谈政治，关心国家大事，到处是一片新气象。
    北京铁路分局的革命职工，在运输工作中，本着毛主席教导的“对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱”的精神，千方百计地为兄弟单位、为工农业生产服务。为了保证工农业生产和人民生活需用的煤炭，全分局上下都把煤炭运输列为重点，最大限度地满足矿区的需要，做到优先拨车，优先运送，产多少，运多少。四月中旬，承德钢厂急需炼钢原料白云石，要求铁路帮助解决。分局计划人员、调度人员和潘家店车站的革命职工，协同作战，立即装运了五车白云石，送到了这个工厂。
    今年以来，北京分局的顺义、南苑、黄土坡、良乡等站，有大批造纸原料急需外运。由于造纸原料是轻浮货物，装车时需用车辆多，又是易燃物品，要大量篷布遮盖，困难比较多。但车站的革命职工，听说这是出版《毛泽东选集》的造纸原料，人人激情满怀，干劲倍增，想出了许多办法，克服了困难，改进了装载方法。过去造纸原料常常对流运输，造成运力浪费。这次他们主动建议有关部门，调整供应线路，做到了合理运输。今年以来，这个分局就运送了造纸原料二千五百多车，保证了造纸厂的需要，光荣地完成了这一政治任务。
    越是困难的地方越是要去
    北京铁路分局革命职工认识到：同阶级敌人破坏抓革命、促生产的阴谋作斗争，保证铁路运输畅通，这是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一个重要方面。他们共同提出：“一定要把铁路运输搞好，给毛主席他老人家争气。”工人们顶困难上，抢重担子挑，人人精神振奋，个个斗志昂扬。三月十一日，北京开往郑州的二○五次客车，有的乘务员因故不能出勤，分局调度所当班的同志听说后就主动支援，他们说：“我们来干！决不让客车晚开一分钟！”分局机关同志听到了这个消息，也主动要来支援，他们说：“调度所当班同志已经工作了一夜，一定要保证他们充分休息。”他们争先担任乘务员，使二○五次客车按原计划开出。
    丰台机务段有一个时期，乘务人员比较缺，全国闻名的“毛泽东号”机车组的同志，休班时总是抢先要求替班，他们在调度室长期挂号，啥时需要，随叫随到。有一次，机车入厂去检修，副司机高俊亭同志就到别的机车连续替了半个月的班。司机长蔡连兴同志，也很好地发扬了共产主义协作精神。
    北京铁路分局的革命职工，遵照毛主席“要提倡顾全大局”的教导，身在铁路，胸怀全国，把别人的任务当作自己的任务，把别人的困难当作自己的困难。当兄弟企业厂内运输紧张的时候，他们就派出铁路调车机，进厂帮助调动车辆，克服困难。丰台机务段的革命职工，在本段任务十分繁忙的情况下，准备了五台最好的机车，六十名乘务员，整装待命，听候领导机关的调配，随时准备支援兄弟单位。
    为革命多流一滴汗
    在文化大革命节节胜利的凯歌声中，北京铁路分局党内一小撮走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，妄图垂死挣扎，刮起了一阵无政府主义的妖风。
    铁路分局的广大革命职工在同阶级敌人和无政府主义的激烈斗争中，心中只有一个红太阳，他们认识到，“抓革命，促生产”，是毛主席提出的伟大方针。能不能坚守生产岗位，自觉地遵守革命纪律，保证伟大领袖毛主席所在地北京与全国的铁路运输畅通无阻，这是听不听毛主席的话，照不照毛主席指示办事，忠不忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的试金石。大家以毛泽东思想为武器，坚决反对无政府主义，揪出了兴风作浪的坏分子，顶住了这股妖风。
    现在，在北京铁路分局，无论车站、货场、车间、工区，还是机车包车组、列车乘务组，绝大部分职工都能坚守生产岗位，自觉遵守劳动纪律。有的职工提出了“红心向着毛主席，永当革命的火车头，坚持生产不放松，哪儿有困难哪儿冲”的战斗口号，到处是一片朝气蓬勃的气象。西直门机务拆返段的一些老司机，白天当班工作，晚上在值班室休息，哪里缺人他们就往哪里顶。一些受过无政府主义思潮影响的青年乘务员，在支左的解放军同志帮助下，在老工人的带动下，认识到自己是上了阶级敌人的当，纷纷起来揭发阶级敌人的阴谋，并斗了自己的私心，表示坚决坚守岗位，服从分配。丰台枢纽站的职工，出勤率达到了百分之九十以上。许多机车组，为了加速车辆和货物的周转，想方设法多拉快跑。许多职工以两个“极端”为镜子，不怕牺牲，排除万难，忠于职守，坚持原则，维护人民的利益。
    “为节煤多流一滴汗，就是为革命多流一滴汗”，北京铁路工人们还开展了节煤活动。丰台机务段建设型五三一六号机车包乘组，今年一月份节煤一百二十六吨，二月份又创造了节煤一百六十二吨的新纪录，机车万吨公里用煤，比去年同期实际用煤降低百分之十九点八。目前，丰台机务段已掀起了开革命的火车头，为革命而节煤的革命竞赛活动，节煤新纪录不断刷新。
    物资的节约重要，时间的节约更重要。北京铁路分局革命职工怀着一颗红心，以“只争朝夕”精神，和时间赛跑。西直门站装卸工人为革命珍惜每一分钟，干起活来争分夺秒。过去卸六十吨重的车，需要两小时，现在一个小时就卸完。北京的铁路工人们，就这样以实际行动，贯彻执行着毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。
