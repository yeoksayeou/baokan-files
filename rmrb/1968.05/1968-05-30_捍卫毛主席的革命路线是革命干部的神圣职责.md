At this crucial moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao personally approved the order issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, conferring upon Comrade Men He, Deputy Political Instructor of the Second Battalion of a regiment of the Qinghai Provincial Military District of the People's Liberation Army, the honorable title of "A Good Cadre Loyal to Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line." This sets a shining example for revolutionary cadres throughout the Party, the nation, and the army.

Under the nurturing of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the People's Liberation Army has produced countless heroes. Comrade Men He is another great communist warrior, after Li Wenzhong, the model of supporting the left and loving the people, who shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. At a critical moment in the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines on the Qinghai Plateau, he enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the broad leftist masses" and "protect the leftists." He steadfastly supported the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat and established deep proletarian feelings with the revolutionary masses. During an accidental explosion of explosives, he fearlessly rushed towards the explosives, sacrificing his own blood and life to protect the safety of twenty-seven class brothers present. His heroic deeds once again vividly embodied the noble quality of the People's Liberation Army serving the people wholeheartedly.

Comrade Men He is an outstanding representative of the countless cadres who are infinitely loyal to the people, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, and infinitely loyal to the Party's line. He regards executing and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as his sacred duty. He has resolved: "To stand guard, stand firm, and fight well for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." Over the past eighteen years since the founding of the nation, he has always stood unwaveringly on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, with the heroic spirit of a proletarian revolutionary, and engaged in unyielding struggles against the counter-revolutionary revisionist line advocated by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. He resolutely opposed the black wind of "three independences and one contract" stirred up by China's Khrushchev, bravely defending the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's general line for socialist construction. He strongly resisted the bourgeois military line advocated by the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan, bravely defending Chairman Mao's proletarian military line. He firmly supported the occupation of the cultural front in the army with Mao Zedong Thought. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he stood firm and clear-cut, bravely fighting to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Comrade Men He is indeed a good cadre of Chairman Mao in continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao said: "The policy of the Communist Party towards its cadres should be to judge them by whether they can firmly carry out the Party's line, obey the Party's discipline, maintain close ties with the masses, have independent working ability, be active and hardworking, and not seek personal gain." Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the only correct line of our Party, the life and soul of our Party, and the fundamental guarantee of revolutionary victory. "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." As a revolutionary cadre, the most important thing is to have a high level of awareness of the struggle between the two lines, to be able to connect with the masses, lead the masses, and struggle to implement and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This is a matter of revolutionary principle, the fundamental mark of a cadre's loyalty to Chairman Mao, to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and to the interests of the people. It is on this issue that Comrade Men He has set the best example for us, the broad cadres.

Comrade Men He has a high level of awareness of the struggle between the two lines because he has a conscious and thorough loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. He can insist on learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice. He said: "Whatever does not conform to Chairman Mao's teachings, I will firmly oppose!" With his unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, Men He was able to see through Peng Dehuai's bourgeois military line: "Chairman Mao taught us to learn from the glorious traditions of the Red Army and the Eighth Route Army, why insist on learning those foreign doctrines!" With his unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, Men He dared to declare war on Luo Ronghuan's bourgeois military line: "To emphasize military affairs and squeeze out proletarian politics, unless you remove me! As long as I am a squad leader, I will insist on the Four Firsts for a day!" With his unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, in the sharp and complex class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat, Men He was able to draw a clear line between the correct line and the wrong line, always standing on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Comrade Men He said: "Revolution is not about becoming an official, but about serving the people," "To be a cow for the people for life, to pull the revolutionary cart for life." In this way, he can always breathe with the masses and share their destiny. In this way, he can deeply understand and follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, never losing his way under any circumstances.

Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is our lifeline. By adhering to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, our country can stride forward on the broad road of socialism, and the proletariat and working people will have everything; without Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, our Party and country will change color, and the proletariat and working people will lose everything. All new and old revolutionary cadres throughout the Party, the nation, and the army, and members of revolutionary committees at all levels, should resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, seriously learn from Comrade Men He, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, criticize and repudiate revisionism, and continuously raise the awareness of the struggle between the two lines. Struggle to implement and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and strive bravely to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    捍卫毛主席的革命路线是革命干部的神圣职责
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要时刻，我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席亲自批准，中共中央、中央军委、中央文革发布命令，授予人民解放军青海省军区某部四团二营副教导员门合同志以“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”的光荣称号，为全党全国全军革命干部指出了一个光辉榜样。
    在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下，人民解放军英雄辈出。门合同志，是继支左爱民模范李文忠之后出现的又一个闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的伟大的共产主义战士。他在青海高原两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈搏斗的关键时刻，热烈响应毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”和“要保护左派”的伟大号召，坚定不移地支持无产阶级的革命左派，和广大革命群众建立了深厚的无产阶级感情。在一次炸药发生意外爆炸的时候，他临危不惧，猛扑到炸药上，以自己的鲜血和生命，保护了在场的二十七个阶级兄弟的生命安全。他的英雄事迹，又一次地集中体现了人民解放军全心全意地为人民服务的崇高品质。
    门合同志是千千万万无限忠于人民、无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于党的路线的革命干部的一个突出代表。他把执行和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，作为自己的神圣职责。他下定决心：“为毛主席的革命路线放好哨，站好岗，打好仗”。建国十八年来，他始终不渝地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，以无产阶级革命英雄气概，同党内一小撮最大的走资派推行的反革命修正主义路线，进行了顽强不屈的斗争。他坚决反对中国赫鲁晓夫刮起的“三自一包”的黑风，英勇地捍卫毛泽东思想伟大红旗，捍卫党的社会主义建设总路线。他有力地抵制了反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿推行的资产阶级反动军事路线，英勇地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级建军路线。他坚决拥护用毛泽东思想占领部队的文化阵地。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，为保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而英勇战斗。门合同志不愧是无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的毛主席的好干部。
    毛主席说：“共产党的干部政策，应是以能否坚决地执行党的路线，服从党的纪律，和群众有密切的联系，有独立的工作能力，积极肯干，不谋私利为标准”。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是我们党的唯一正确的路线，是我们党的生命和灵魂，是取得革命胜利的根本保证。“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”作为一个革命干部，最重要的，就是要有高度的两条路线斗争觉悟，能够联系群众，带领群众，为贯彻执行和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而斗争。这是革命的大节，是一个干部忠于毛主席、忠于无产阶级革命事业、忠于人民利益的根本标志。正是在这个问题上，门合同志为我们广大干部作出了最好的榜样。
    门合同志所以有高度的两条路线斗争觉悟，是由于他对毛主席、对毛泽东思想，有自觉的忠，彻底的忠。他对毛泽东思想，能够坚持活学活用，学用结合。他说：“凡是不符合毛主席教导的，我就要坚决反对！”有了对毛主席的无限忠诚，门合就能够识破彭德怀的资产阶级军事路线：“毛主席教导我们要学习红军、八路军的光荣传统，为什么硬要学那些洋教条！”有了对毛主席的无限忠诚，门合就敢于向罗瑞卿的资产阶级军事路线宣战：“要突出军事，挤掉无产阶级政治，除非把我撤了！我当一天指导员，就要坚持一天四个第一！”有了对毛主席的无限忠诚，在无产阶级专政下的尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，门合就能够划清正确路线和错误路线的界线，始终站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。
    门合同志说：“革命不是做官，而是为人民服务”，“当一辈子人民的牛，拉一辈子革命的车”。这样，他就能够永远和群众同呼吸，共命运。这样，他就能够深刻理解和紧跟毛主席的革命路线，在任何情况下都不会迷失方向。
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是我们的命根子。坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，我们的国家就能在社会主义的大道上阔步前进，无产阶级和劳动人民就有了一切；离开了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，我们的党和国家就会改变颜色，无产阶级和劳动人民就会丧失一切。全党全国全军的一切新老革命干部，各级革命委员会的成员，都应该坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，认真地向门合同志学习，活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，不断地提高两条路线斗争的觉悟，为执行和保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，而英勇奋斗。
