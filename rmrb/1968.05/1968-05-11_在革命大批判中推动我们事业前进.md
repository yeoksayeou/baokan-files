The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is a magnificent mass movement to criticize the bourgeoisie. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism guided by Mao Zedong Thought. They bravely launch fierce attacks on the bourgeoisie and their agents, making the revolutionary criticism of the bourgeoisie a magnificent and unprecedented movement. Criticism meetings involving military and civilian personnel, field criticism meetings, workshop and shop criticism meetings, and family criticism meetings are held everywhere. In the great criticism of the revolution, the ugly faces of a handful of capitalist-roaders, traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries have been exposed. The reactionary ideas of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes have been severely struck. In the great criticism of the revolution, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has been widely propagated as never before, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has deeply entered the hearts of the people. In the great criticism of the revolution, the masses who have been deceived are awakening one after another, revolutionary cadres are coming forward in batches, revolutionary great alliances are developing and consolidating, and the revolutionary three-in-one combination is advancing step by step. In short, under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, the great criticism of the revolution is pushing the whole society forward and advancing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from victory to victory.

Criticizing the bourgeoisie is a strategic task for the entire historical period of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has flushed out the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the bourgeoisie, and their agents within our Party—the handful of capitalist-roaders, traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries like the Chinese Khrushchev—from their dark corners. However, the thoughts of these reactionaries "cannot be put into coffins and buried in graves. They rot and stink among us and poison us." In the ideological realm, they still have considerable strength and will manifest themselves in various ways, striving to corrupt the masses, conquer hearts, and achieve their goal of restoration. Under these circumstances, the inevitable and long-term struggle between the bourgeoisie and their agents, who have been overthrown and are attempting to restore their power, and the proletariat, who are fighting against restoration, is unavoidable.

The glorious and arduous task bestowed by history upon the proletariat is to continue to hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism guided by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and to launch a resolute attack on all challenges from the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm. In a word, every proletarian revolutionary fighter should become a brave critic of the old world, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to resolutely and thoroughly criticize the bourgeoisie, and using the new thoughts, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat to change the spiritual face of the whole society. This is absolutely necessary for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and for building socialism and eventually transitioning to communism. It is in accordance with the laws of historical development.

    在革命大批判中推动我们事业前进
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是批判资产阶级的伟大群众运动。广大工农兵群众响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，勇敢地向资产阶级及其代理人猛烈开火，批判资产阶级的革命大批判运动波澜壮阔，史无前例。军民批判会、田头批判会、车间、店堂批判会和家庭批判会遍及各地。在革命的大批判中，一小撮走资派、叛徒、特务和反革命分子的丑恶面目被揭露了，资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的反动思想遭到了沉重打击。在革命的大批判中，战无不胜的毛泽东思想得到了空前的大普及，毛主席的革命路线空前地深入人心。在革命的大批判中，受蒙蔽的群众不断觉醒，革命干部一批又一批地站出来，革命大联合不断发展和巩固，革命三结合节节向前。总之，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，革命大批判推动着整个社会不断前进，推动着无产阶级文化大革命从胜利走向胜利。
    批判资产阶级，是整个无产阶级专政历史时期的战略任务。无产阶级文化大革命的滚滚洪流，将国民党反动派、资产阶级在我们党内的代理人和残渣余孽——中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派、叛徒、特务、反革命分子从阴暗角落里冲刷了出来，然而，这些反动家伙的思想却“是不能装进棺材、埋入坟墓的。它在我们中间腐烂发臭并且毒害我们”。在意识形态领域方面，他们还有相当的能量，还会以各种不同的方式顽强地表现出来，力图腐蚀群众，征服人心，达到复辟的目的。在这种情况下，被打倒的资产阶级及其代理人力图复辟和无产阶级反复辟的激烈尖锐的斗争，就不可避免地会长期继续下去。
    历史赋予无产阶级的光荣而艰巨的任务，就是继续高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，迎头痛击资产阶级在意识形态领域里的一切挑战。一句话，每一个无产阶级革命战士都应当成为旧世界的勇敢批判者，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想，坚决、彻底地批判资产阶级，用无产阶级的新思想，新文化，新风俗，新习惯，来改变整个社会的精神面貌。这是巩固无产阶级专政所绝对必需的，是建设社会主义和将来过渡到共产主义所绝对必需的。是合乎历史发展规律的。《浙江日报》五月七日社论
