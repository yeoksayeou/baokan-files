Title: Coal Dust in the Ditch Should Be Recovered

In front of our factory, there is a small ditch. Since the beginning of spring, many people have been digging coal dust from the ditch every day. Sometimes, four or five people can dig out a ton of coal in a day.

Where does all this coal dust in the ditch come from? It turns out that it flows from the underground water ditch of a nearby factory. This factory uses water to wash coal, and each time, it flushes out two or three tons of coal dust, which flows into the small river.

If we can recover this coal dust, it would save the country a lot of precious resources!

Chairman Mao teaches us, "Embezzlement and waste are grave crimes." We revolutionary workers should follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, eliminate all waste, and make full use of all resources that can be utilized.

I hope that the comrades in this factory will actively find ways to recover this coal dust.

### 河沟里的煤末应该设法回收

　　河沟里的煤末应该设法回收
    我厂门前有条小河沟，开春以来，每天都有好多人从河沟里挖煤末。有时四五个人，一天就能挖上吨的煤。
    这条河沟里的煤末究竟是从那来的？原来是从附近一个工厂的地下水沟流出来的。这个厂烧煤必须用水冲，每次就要冲出二、三吨煤末，顺水沟流到小河里。如果把这些煤末回收起来，可以为国家节约多少宝贵的资源！
    毛主席教导我们“贪污和浪费是极大的犯罪”。我们革命工人应该遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，杜绝一切浪费漏洞，把可以利用的物资都充分利用起来。
    我希望这个厂的同志积极设法回收这些煤末。
