The revolutionary workers of the Benxi Mining Bureau's Ling Shan Coal Washing Plant, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have displayed the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and struggle. They have carried out the revolution and promoted production, successfully manufacturing a high-efficiency centrifugal vibration dewatering machine. This has raised the level of China's coal washing and dewatering technology to a new height.

The dewatering machine is an essential piece of equipment in a coal washing plant. Coal mined from the ground must be washed in a coal washing plant to reduce its ash content and become clean coal. It then undergoes dewatering treatment before being sent to coking plants for use in the steel industry. Previously, the dewatering machines used in China's coal washing plants were mostly imported from abroad or were copies of foreign designs. These machines were heavy, took up a lot of space, consumed a lot of electricity, and had low capacity. The clean coal they produced had a high water content, which was detrimental to coking and also created significant difficulties for railway transportation.

In the winter of 1965, the workers at the Ling Shan Coal Washing Plant saw that the clean coal they produced, due to its high water content, froze to the railcars when transported to the coking plant, affecting production. They were very concerned and proposed to solve this key problem. However, their suggestions were obstructed by the capitalist-roaders and a few technical "authorities" within the plant. In early 1966, inspired by Chairman Mao's great teachings on self-reliance, nineteen mechanical and electrical workers voluntarily formed a technical innovation "light cavalry" team, determined to solve this problem. Despite the obstruction from the capitalist-roaders and technical "authorities" within the plant, they displayed the bold, daring, and revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, kicking out the "foreign" equipment, and started making dewatering machines themselves. Chairman Mao's great teaching that "we cannot follow the old path of technological development of all countries in the world, crawling behind others step by step" gave the members of the technical innovation "light cavalry" team boundless wisdom and strength. They worked hard for several months and, in March 1966, manufactured a dewatering machine. However, it failed during the test run. But the participants in the technical innovation did not lose heart. They remembered Chairman Mao's teaching that "in the socialist cause, to think that one can achieve success without going through difficulties and twists and turns, without making great efforts, is just an illusion." They persisted in their research. The workers' revolutionary spirit of daring to innovate angered a clique of capitalist-roaders within the party. At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the leader of this technical innovation "light cavalry" team was labeled a "counter-revolutionary" and "careerist" by a clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, one of the charges being "wasting state resources."

Through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the workers gradually understood that the struggle in the process of technical innovation involves two classes, two lines of thought, and two paths. The reason the clique of capitalist-roaders within the party suppressed the workers' technical innovation activities was to push the reactionary revisionist line of Liu Shaoqi in enterprise management. Thus, the workers engaged in a head-on struggle with the clique of capitalist-roaders within the party and the bourgeois technical "authorities," fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's reactionary revisionist line and the "crawling" mentality of relying on and worshipping foreign technology. They actively participated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They said, "If the clique of capitalist-roaders within the party is not overthrown, technical innovation cannot be carried out." At the same time, even during the most intense days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they remained at their production posts and continued to carry out technical innovation activities. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, with the strong support of the design department and other brother units, they finally overcame various technical difficulties and successfully developed the high-efficiency centrifugal vibration dewatering machine.

　　活学活用毛泽东思想发扬奋发图强的革命精神
　　本溪制成高效率离心震动脱水机
　　把我国洗煤脱水技术提高到一个新的水平
    据新华社沈阳八日电  本溪矿务局灵山洗煤厂的革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，抓革命，促生产，成功地制造出一台高效率离心震动脱水机，把我国洗煤脱水技术提高到一个新的水平。
    脱水机是洗煤厂的重要设备。煤矿生产出来的煤，要经洗煤厂水洗降低灰分，成为精煤，再经过脱水处理，才能送去炼焦，供钢铁工业使用。过去，我国洗煤厂使用的脱水机大都是从外国进口或根据外国型号仿造，不但设备重，占地面积大，费电，而且能力低，脱出来的精煤水分也比较高，既对炼焦不利，也给铁路运输增加很大困难。
    一九六五年冬天，灵山洗煤厂工人看到自己生产出来的精煤，由于水分高，运到炼焦厂都冻结在车皮上，使生产受到影响，非常着急，都提出要解决这一关键问题。可是，工人们的建议受到了厂内走资派和少数技术“权威”的阻挠。一九六六年初，在毛主席有关自力更生的伟大教导鼓舞下，十九名机电工人自动组成了一支技术革新“轻骑队”，决心解决这个问题。他们不顾厂内走资派和技术“权威”的阻拦，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干的无产阶级革命精神，踢开“洋”设备，自己动手造脱水机。伟大领袖毛主席关于“我们不能走世界各国技术发展的老路，跟在别人后面一步一步地爬行”的伟大教导，给技术革新“轻骑队”的同志们以无穷的智慧和力量。他们苦干了几个月，在一九六六年三月制成一台脱水机，可是一试转却失败了。但参加技术革新的同志并不灰心，他们牢记毛主席“在社会主义事业中，要想不经过艰难曲折，不付出极大努力，总是一帆风顺，容易得到成功，这种想法，只是幻想”的教导，坚持不懈地进行研究。工人们敢于创造的革命精神，触怒了党内一小撮走资派。无产阶级文化大革命初期，这个技术革新“轻骑队”的负责人被党内一小撮走资派打成“反革命”、“野心家”，罪状之一是“浪费国家资财”。
    工人们在斗争中通过活学活用毛主席著作，逐渐明白了在技术革新过程中贯穿着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。党内一小撮走资派所以这样压制工人的技术革新活动，就是要在企业管理中推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线。于是，工人们同党内一小撮走资派及资产阶级技术“权威”进行了针锋相对的斗争，狠狠地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线和在技术上迷信和依赖外国的“爬行思想”。他们积极参加了无产阶级文化大革命。他们说：“党内一小撮走资派斗不倒，技术革新就搞不好。”同时，就是在无产阶级文化大革命战斗最紧张的日子里，他们仍然坚守生产岗位，不懈地开展技术革新活动。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在设计部门和其它兄弟单位的大力协助下，他们终于克服种种技术难关，试制成功了高效率离心震动脱水机。
