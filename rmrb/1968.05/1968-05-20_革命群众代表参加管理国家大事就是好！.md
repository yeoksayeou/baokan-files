It is good for revolutionary masses representatives to participate in managing state affairs! Zhang Fengxuan, Chairman of the Xingguo County Revolutionary Committee

The proletarian cultural revolution in Xingguo County has achieved great victories over the past two years, following the direction indicated in the "Notice." The county's revolutionary committee has been established. Many outstanding proletarian elements who emerged during the proletarian cultural revolution have joined the three-in-one revolutionary committee of the county to manage state affairs. The participation of revolutionary masses representatives in the revolutionary committee can better help our leadership at all levels achieve revolutionization, making the leadership at all levels a revolutionary, authoritative, closely connected with the masses, and vigorous power organ.

The young cadres who have joined our county's revolutionary committee are the most experienced fighters in the great struggle of the proletarian cultural revolution. They come from the masses and are rooted among the masses. They are not only members of the revolutionary committee but also do not leave their production posts, always maintaining the character of the working people. They understand the opinions, voices, demands, and movements of the masses most clearly and deeply. Therefore, they can frequently bring the opinions of the masses to the revolutionary committee and, at the same time, convey Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the voice of the proletarian headquarters to the masses, playing a very good role and promoting the in-depth development of the cultural revolution in our county.

The participation of revolutionary masses representatives in the revolutionary committee can more effectively exercise revolutionary supervision from the bottom up on this temporary power organ of the revolutionary three-in-one combination, helping us to continuously overcome shortcomings and errors in our work. For a period, we were busy establishing the leadership of the communes, attending more meetings upstairs and going to the grassroots less. The revolutionary masses representatives immediately gave us sincere criticism.

To give full play to the supervisory role of the masses representatives, we solicit the opinions of revolutionary mass organizations on major issues and work arrangements, drawing wisdom from the masses and pooling ideas. We also invite representatives of revolutionary mass organizations to face-to-face discussions with the members of the revolutionary committee, thereby promoting the ideological revolutionization of the revolutionary committee members.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "If our party does not have a large number of new cadres cooperating with the old cadres, our cause will be interrupted." Following Chairman Mao's great teaching, within our revolutionary committee, new and old cadres, revolutionary leading cadres, military representatives, and revolutionary masses representatives have carried out "one-to-one" activities, learning from each other and making up for each other's shortcomings. Through this activity, we have strengthened unity among us on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, truly achieving what Chairman Mao teaches, making the predecessors not alienated from the masses and making the young people get tempered.

Currently, the broad proletarian revolutionary masses, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary Red Guards in Xingguo County are advancing under the guidance of the "Notice" and Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, developing a great situation. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, deeply and persistently carry out the great criticism of the revolution, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," redoubling our efforts, striving to be the best, and striving to achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution.

    革命群众代表参加管理国家大事就是好！
    兴国县革命委员会主任　张凤选
    兴国县的无产阶级文化大革命，两年来沿着《通知》指引的方向，取得了伟大的胜利。县的革命委员会已经成立。许多在无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出来的无产阶级优秀分子，参加了三结合的县革命委员会，管理国家大事。革命群众的代表参加革命委员会，就能够更好地帮助我们各级领导班子实现革命化，使各级领导班子成为革命的、有无产阶级权威的、密切联系群众的、朝气蓬勃的权力机构。
    参加我们县革命委员会的年轻小将，是在无产阶级文化大革命伟大斗争中冲锋陷阵，最有实践经验的战士。他们来自群众，扎根于群众之中。他们既是革命委员会的领导成员，又不脱离生产岗位，始终保持着劳动人民的本色。他们对群众的意见、群众的呼声、群众的要求、群众的动向，了解得最清楚，体会得最深切。因此，他们能经常不断地把群众的意见带到革命委员会中来，同时又把毛主席的最新指示和无产阶级司令部的声音传达到群众中去，发挥了很好的作用，推动了我县文化大革命运动的深入开展。
    革命群众的代表参加革命委员会，可以更有效地对这个革命三结合的临时权力机构实行自下而上的革命监督，帮助我们不断克服工作中的缺点和错误。有一个时期，我们忙于建立公社的领导班子，在上面开会多，到基层去得少了，革命群众的代表立即向我们提出了诚恳的批评。
    为了发挥群众代表的革命监督作用，我们作出有关重大问题的决定和布置工作，都广泛征求革命群众组织的意见，从群众中吸取智慧，集思广益。我们还邀请革命群众组织的代表，对革委会成员面对面地提意见，从而推动了革命委员会成员的思想革命化。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“我们党如果没有广大的新干部同老干部一致合作，我们的事业就会中断。”遵照毛主席这一伟大教导，我们革委会内部新老干部之间，革命领导干部、军队代表和革命群众代表之间，开展了“一帮一”的活动，大家互相学习，互相取长补短。通过这一活动，加强了彼此之间在毛泽东思想原则基础上的团结，真正做到毛主席教导的那样，使前辈人不脱离群众，使青年人得到锻炼。
    当前，我们兴国县广大无产阶级革命派、贫下中农和革命的红卫兵小将正在《通知》和毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，乘胜前进，发展大好形势。我们一定牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，鼓足干劲，力争上游，努力创造第一等的工作，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
