In the great march to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the situation in Shaanxi Province is exceptionally good and getting better and better.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Xi'an, in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in Shaanxi Province, armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, closely combine the actual class struggle in their units, and carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism. They launch a fierce attack on the revisionist fallacies spread by the clique of traitors and capitalist-roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, and his agents in Northwest China and Shaanxi Province, smashing their plot to restore capitalism. After the publication of Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes in the condition of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie," the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in Shaanxi Province, in connection with the actual class struggle in their units, carry out the revolutionary criticism more deeply, dealing a fatal blow to the class enemies who attempt to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and strongly promoting the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, further developing the excellent situation. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Baoji County, a small handful of die-hard capitalist-roaders within the Party, in collusion with the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, stirred up a wind of reversing correct verdicts, directing their spearheads at the People's Liberation Army and the newly born Revolutionary Committee. The Revolutionary Committee of Baoji County, armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, promptly exposed the plot of the class enemies, mobilized the masses to launch a fierce attack on the class enemies, repelled the counterattack of the class enemies, and consolidated the newly born Revolutionary Committee.

After the great call by the great leader Chairman Mao to "struggle against selfishness and repudiate revisionism" and to set up study classes, the broad revolutionary masses in Shaanxi Province, under the assistance of the left-supporting units of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shaanxi, immediately launched a campaign to set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In a short period of a few months, Mao Zedong Thought study classes have spread throughout urban and rural areas. According to incomplete statistics, so far, the province has held more than 36,000 study classes of various types, with more than 3.3 million people participating in the study. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses, with deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, expose and criticize their selfishness in the study classes, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and successively established unified revolutionary mass organizations such as the Provincial and Xi'an Regional Workers' Congress, Farmers' Congress, Higher Education Red Guards Congress, and Middle School Red Guards Congress. Through the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes attended by cadres, they enthusiastically helped the cadres to bravely come out and participate in the revolution, creating favorable conditions for the establishment of the Shaanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee.

The broad masses of workers and peasants, revolutionary cadres in Shaanxi Province, in response to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," have brought the surging momentum unleashed in the Cultural Revolution to production. The more than 31 million mu of summer crops in the province, after careful management, are generally growing well. Industrial production in the province is also developing day by day. A high tide of agricultural and industrial production is gradually forming in the province.

The broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army fighting on the front line of the "three supports and two militaries" in Shaanxi Province, conscientiously implement the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," and with boundless enthusiasm, use Mao Zedong Thought to propagate, organize, arm, and help the masses, and carry out a series of painstaking ideological and political work for the realization of the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. The People's Liberation Army units stationed in Shaanxi Province have modelly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions and made immortal contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shaanxi Province.

　　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下
　　陕西革命和生产形势越来越好
    据新华社西安一日电　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大进军中，在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，陕西全省无产阶级文化大革命形势空前大好，越来越好。
    陕西省一百零一个县、市，目前大部分已经在毛泽东思想的原则基础上实现了革命的大联合，不少县、市还成立了革命委员会。在基层单位，革命大联合和革命三结合的步伐更加迅猛。在西安地区，工厂企业已有百分之九十以上实现了革命的大联合，各人民公社已全部实现了革命的大联合。有大批基层单位建立起了革命三结合的临时权力机构。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，陕西省广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，紧密结合本单位阶级斗争的实际，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大一小撮走资派及其在西北和陕西省的代理人发起猛烈的进攻，狠揭猛批他们散布的反革命修正主义谬论，粉碎了他们复辟资本主义的阴谋。毛主席的最新指示“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续”发表后，陕西省广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众联系本单位的阶级斗争实际，更加深入地开展革命的大批判，给妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阶级敌人以致命的打击，有力地促进了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，进一步发展了大好形势。宝鸡县革命委员会成立以后，党内一小撮顽固不化的走资派，勾结国民党反动派的残渣余孽，刮起了一股翻案妖风，他们把矛头指向人民解放军，指向新生的革命委员会。宝鸡县革委会以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，及时识破了阶级敌人的阴谋，发动群众向阶级敌人展开猛烈进攻，击退了阶级敌人的反扑，巩固了新生的革命委员会。
    伟大领袖毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”和大办学习班的伟大号召以后，陕西省广大革命群众闻风而动，在人民解放军驻陕西支左部队的帮助下，立即掀起了一个大办毛泽东思想学习班的热潮。在短短几个月内，毛泽东思想学习班就遍及城乡各地。据不完全统计，到目前为止，全省举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班三万六千多期，参加学习的人数达三百三十多万人。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，怀着无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的深厚无产阶级感情，在学习班内亮私斗私，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，先后成立了陕西省和西安地区的工代会、农代会、大专院校红代会和中等学校红代会等统一的革命群众组织，并且通过举办有干部参加的毛泽东思想学习班，热情地帮助干部勇敢地站出来革命，为成立陕西省革命委员会创造了有利的条件。
    陕西省广大工农群众、革命干部在无产阶级文化大革命中，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，把在文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲运用到生产上去。全省三千一百多万亩夏田作物经过细心管理，普遍生长良好。全省工业生产也在日益发展。一个工农业生产的高潮，正在全省逐步形成。
    战斗在陕西省“三支”“两军”第一线的人民解放军广大指战员，认真贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的教导，满腔热情地用毛泽东思想宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众，帮助群众，为实现革命大联合和革命三结合进行了一系列艰苦细致的思想政治工作。人民解放军驻陕西部队模范地执行毛主席的最新指示，为陕西省的无产阶级文化大革命立下不朽的功勋。
