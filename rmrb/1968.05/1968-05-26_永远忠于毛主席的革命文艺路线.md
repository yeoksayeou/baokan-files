A strong wind blows, the landscape is picturesque. The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the country is excellent. The vast number of revolutionary comrades of the proletariat are, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, further comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, advancing with the momentum of victory, and striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Whenever we recall this glorious battle process, we deeply feel that every victory of ours is the result of Chairman Mao's teachings. As long as we listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we will have a clear mind and eyes, be able to ride the east wind, break through the evil waves, and be invincible. Chairman Mao's "Talk" and a series of latest instructions, as well as the brilliant documents such as the "Notice" and the "Summary," are our action guidelines and battle programs for carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and are the sharpest weapons.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To overthrow a government, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." This "public opinion preparation" includes literature and art. Over the past seventeen years, a small clique of counter-revolutionary black gangs, led by Zhou Yang, has usurped the leadership of the literary and art circles, implementing a counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and art black line that opposes Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and art line. They use decadent literature and art of the feudal, bourgeois, and revisionist kinds to corrupt people's souls, undermine our socialist economic foundation, and prepare public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The proletariat cannot be lenient with you; if we follow you, we are actually following the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, and there is the danger of the party and the country perishing." Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, leads us, the proletarian revolutionaries in the literary and art circles, to launch a fierce attack on the counter-revolutionary black gangs entrenched in the literary and art circles. We have broken through the layer upon layer of suppression and obstruction by a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party and their agents in various departments, hacked our way through thorns and thistles, and charged into the enemy's ranks, advancing from one victory to another. Finally, in the fields of drama, music, and dance, we have created a series of revolutionary models, established the heroic images of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and turned the upside-down history back to its right side.

Our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing has made great achievements in the revolution of Peking opera and is a shining example for us to learn from. We will never forget that during the period when we were blinded by the revisionist literary and art black line and could not see the direction, it was our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing who came to us, used the sharp sword of Mao Zedong Thought to clear the mist for us, and pointed out the direction for us to advance.

At every critical moment in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Comrade Jiang Qing has timely brought us Mao Zedong Thought, guiding us to advance victoriously on the track indicated by Chairman Mao. Every victory in the literary and art circles is inseparable from Comrade Jiang Qing's specific guidance.

Under the care and guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing, our theater is gradually implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We have achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, continuously eliminated interference from the right or ultra-left, carried out a sustained revolutionary great criticism, and achieved great victories in the people's war of cleaning up class ranks. In the previous stage, due to class enemies infiltrating revolutionary mass organizations, playing tricks, shooting dark arrows, and stirring up internal strife between the two factions, they tried to muddy the waters and slip away, disrupting the development of the revolutionary great criticism. Comrade Jiang Qing timely sounded the alarm for us, reminding us not to fall for the class enemies' tricks. Under the correct leadership of the revolutionary committee of our theater, we have set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, through criticizing and repudiating revisionism and self-criticism, identified who our enemies and friends are, criticized factionalism, sectarianism, and rightist thoughts in revolutionary mass organizations, and united the broad revolutionary masses on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. We have exposed one by one the traitors, spies, and a small clique of diehard capitalist roaders and counter-revolutionary revisionists within the party. Currently, we are carrying out a mass revolutionary great criticism, with everyone condemning and criticizing with pen and mouth, thoroughly settling accounts with the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and art black line.

We must see that the class enemies will never be willing to fail and will inevitably struggle desperately. Once they have a chance, they will try to reverse the verdict and counterattack. We must not be complacent or underestimate them. We must remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle" and carry out the revolutionary great criticism deeply and sustainably. Without carrying out the revolutionary great criticism, the "revisionist" character cannot be overthrown, the "selfish" character cannot be criticized and repudiated, the black roots cannot be dug out, and Mao Zedong Thought cannot be firmly established.

To carry out the revolutionary great criticism, the most powerful weapon is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. To do a good job in the revolutionary great criticism, we must first launch a mass campaign of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The battlefield of the great criticism is also the classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary ranks are growing and strengthening in the great storms of the struggle between the two classes and the two lines.

"Talk" is the fundamental direction of proletarian literature and art and the action program for literary and art workers to change their worldview. "Talk" is our motto, to be studied and applied for a lifetime, to struggle against the class enemies for a lifetime, and to reform oneself for a lifetime. We will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, under the guidance of our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, and are determined to be thorough proletarian revolutionaries, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    永远忠于毛主席的革命文艺路线
    中国京剧院　钱浩梁
    东风劲吹，江山如画。全国无产阶级文化大革命形势一片大好。广大无产阶级革命派的战友们，正在以毛主席为首、以林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，进一步全面地落实毛主席的最新指示，乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。每当我们回忆这光辉的战斗历程的时候，都深深感到，我们的每一个胜利，都是毛主席教导的结果。只要听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，我们就心明眼亮，就能乘东风，破恶浪，所向披靡，无往不胜。毛主席的《讲话》和一系列最新指示，以及《通知》《纪要》等光辉文献，是我们进行无产阶级文化大革命的行动指南和战斗纲领，是最锐利的武器。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”这种“舆论准备”，其中就包括文艺。十七年来，周扬等一小撮反革命黑帮窃踞了文艺界的领导权，推行了一条同毛主席革命文艺路线相对抗的反革命修正主义文艺黑线。他们用封、资、修的糜烂文艺腐蚀人们的灵魂，瓦解我们社会主义的经济基础，为复辟资本主义做舆论准备。
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级是不能迁就你们的，依了你们，实际上就是依了大地主大资产阶级，就有亡党亡国的危险。”在毛泽东思想指引下，我们敬爱的江青同志高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，率领着我们文艺界的无产阶级革命派，向盘踞在文艺界的反革命黑帮发起了猛烈的进攻，冲破了党内一小撮走资派和他们在各个部门的代理人的层层压制和阻挠，披荆斩棘，冲锋陷阵，从一个胜利走向另一个胜利，终于在戏剧、音乐、舞蹈各个方面，做出了一系列革命的样板，树立了工农兵群众的英雄形象，把被颠倒的历史又颠倒了过来。
    我们敬爱的江青同志，在京剧革命中建立了丰功伟绩，是我们学习的光辉榜样。我们永远也不能忘记，在我们被修正主义文艺黑线蒙蔽了眼睛认不清方向的时期，是我们敬爱的江青同志来到我们中间，用毛泽东思想的利剑为我们拨开了迷雾，指出了前进的方向。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中的每一个关键时刻，江青同志都及时地给我们送来了毛泽东思想，引导我们沿着毛主席指引的轨道胜利前进。文艺界的每一个胜利都是跟江青同志的具体指导分不开的。
    我院在江青同志的关怀指导下，正在一步步地落实毛主席的最新指示。我们实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，不断排除来自右的或极“左”的干扰，开展了持久的革命大批判，在清理阶级队伍的人民战争中取得了很大的胜利。前一阶段，由于阶级敌人混进革命群众组织内部，耍阴谋，放暗箭，挑动两派打内战，企图把水搅浑，自己溜掉，干扰了革命大批判的开展。江青同志及时给我们敲了警钟，提醒我们不要上阶级敌人的当。我们在院革委会的正确领导下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，通过斗私批修，认清了谁是我们的敌人、谁是我们的朋友，批判了革命群众组织中的山头主义、宗派主义和右倾思想，广大革命群众在毛泽东思想基础上联合起来，把叛徒、特务、党内一小撮顽固不化的走资派和反革命修正主义分子一个个揪了出来。目前，我们正在进行一场群众性的革命大批判，人人口诛笔伐，彻底清算反革命修正主义文艺黑线。
    我们必须看到阶级敌人是决不会甘心失败的，他们必然要作垂死的挣扎，一有机会他们就要翻案反扑，我们绝不能麻痹轻敌。我们要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，把革命的大批判深入持久地开展下去，不进行革命的大批判，“修”字批不倒，“私”字斗不臭，黑根挖不掉，毛泽东思想立不牢。
    要进行革命的大批判，最有力的武器就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。要搞好革命大批判，首先要掀起一个群众性的活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，大批判的战场也就是活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂，革命队伍就是在两个阶级、两条路线斗争的大风大浪中成长壮大起来的。
    《讲话》是无产阶级文艺的根本方向，是文艺工作者改造世界观的行动纲领。《讲话》是我们的座右铭，要学一辈子，用一辈子，同阶级敌人斗争一辈子，改造自己一辈子。我们永远忠于毛主席的革命路线，在敬爱的江青同志的指导下，决心作一个彻底的无产阶级革命派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
