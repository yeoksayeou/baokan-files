Read Chairman Mao's books,
Listen to Chairman Mao's words,
Act according to Chairman Mao's instructions,
Be a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

Our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great and strategically significant "May 7th Directive" two years ago, calling on us to turn the entire country and the entire army into revolutionary schools. This is a guiding directive for building socialism in our country and a guiding principle for the revolutionary construction of our army.

Over the past two years, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers in our army have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "make the People's Liberation Army a great school." They have adapted to the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and pushed the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. The entire army has produced many advanced units that have turned into schools of Mao Zedong Thought. The "Model Company for Studying Chairman Mao's Works, the Red Ninth Company" is one of the most outstanding representatives.

The Red Ninth Company has resolutely implemented Vice Chairman Lin Biao's series of important directives on studying Mao Zedong Thought, always standing at the forefront of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the entire army, and continuously creating and developing experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. In the great classroom of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the Red Ninth Company uses Mao Zedong Thought to overcome selfishness and establish public-mindedness, transform worldviews, raise awareness of line struggle, and cultivate batch after batch of revolutionary soldiers loyal to Chairman Mao. They are outstanding cadres who implement Chairman Mao's military line in the army and propagandists who spread Mao Zedong Thought when they go to the localities. The comrades of the Red Ninth Company have withstood severe tests in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and have performed new meritorious deeds for the people. As Vice Chairman Lin Biao pointed out long ago: "A good company is a school, and the Ninth Company is a good school."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The correct political and military lines are not produced and developed naturally and peacefully, but are produced and developed through struggle."

The Red Ninth Company, this school of Mao Zedong Thought, was established and developed in the midst of the fierce struggle between the two lines. The eight years that the Red Ninth Company has carried out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought are eight years of struggle to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian military line. To implement and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, to turn the company into a school of Mao Zedong Thought, we must follow Chairman Mao's instruction to "criticize the bourgeoisie," and carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism. We must fully mobilize the masses to engage in a head-on struggle against the bourgeois military line promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, and thoroughly eliminate its poisonous influence.

The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental issue in the struggle between the two lines. "To overthrow a government, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." The class enemy, in order to attempt to usurp the power of the proletariat, always first tries to seize the leadership of ideology from us and always tries every means to obstruct and sabotage the spread of Mao Zedong Thought. In this sense, studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and widely and deeply spreading Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental issue in consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must, like the Red Ninth Company, elevate the study and application of Chairman Mao's works to the height of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and defending the proletarian revolutionary regime.

Executing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the sacred duty of every cadre and soldier at any time. To run a school of Mao Zedong Thought well, we must, like the Red Ninth Company, ensure that the broad ranks of officers and soldiers can stand firmly on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the great storms and waves of class struggle.

Comrades in the entire army, as we commemorate the second anniversary of the issuance of Chairman Mao's brilliant "May 7th Directive," we must further study and implement Chairman Mao's great directive, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian line for building the party and the army, resolutely implement Vice Chairman Lin Biao's series of principles and policies for emphasizing political construction of the army, such as studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the Four Firsts, promoting the Three-Eight Style, practicing the Three Great Democracies, and creating the Four Good Companies. In the struggle between the two lines, we must turn every company in the entire army into a red-hot school of Mao Zedong Thought!

### 以红九连为榜样，把每个连队办成毛泽东思想大学校

　　以红九连为榜样，把每个连队办成毛泽东思想大学校
　　读毛主席的书，
　　听毛主席的话，
　　照毛主席的指示办事，
　　做毛主席的好战士。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席两年前发出了具有伟大历史意义和战略意义的“五·七”指示，号召我们把全国全军都办成革命的大学校。这是我国建设社会主义的纲领性指示，是我军革命化建设的指针。
    两年来，我军广大指战员热烈响应毛主席关于“人民解放军应该是一个大学校”的伟大号召，适应无产阶级文化大革命的新形势，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向了新阶段。全军涌现出许许多多办成毛泽东思想大学校的先进单位。“学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”就是其中最突出的代表。
    红九连坚决执行林彪副主席关于学习毛泽东思想的一系列重要指示，始终站在全军活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的前列，不断地创造和发展活学活用毛主席著作的经验。红九连在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的大课堂里，用毛泽东思想破私立公，改造世界观，提高路线斗争的觉悟，培养了一批又一批忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命战士。他们在部队是执行毛主席建军路线的优秀骨干，到地方是传播毛泽东思想的宣传员。红九连的同志在无产阶级文化大革命中经受住严峻的考验，为人民立下了新功。正如林彪副主席早就指出的：“好的连队就是一个学校，九连就是一个好学校。”
    毛主席教导我们：“正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”
    红九连这个毛泽东思想的大学校，就是在两条路线的激烈斗争中创办和发展起来的。红九连开展活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的八年，就是为捍卫毛主席的无产阶级建军路线而斗争的八年。不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行。经验证明，要贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级建军路线，把连队办成毛泽东思想的大学校，就必须遵守毛主席关于“要批判资产阶级”的教导，深入持久地开展革命的大批判。要充分发动群众，同中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿推行的资产阶级军事路线，展开针锋相对的斗争，彻底肃清它的流毒。
    对毛泽东思想的态度问题，是两条路线斗争的根本问题。“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”阶级敌人为了企图篡夺无产阶级的政权，总是首先要和我们争夺思想上的领导权，总是千方百计地阻挠和破坏毛泽东思想的传播。从这个意义上讲，活学活用毛泽东思想，广泛地、深入地传播毛泽东思想，是巩固无产阶级专政的根本问题。我们要象红九连那样，把活学活用毛主席著作，提高到保卫毛主席的革命路线，保卫无产阶级革命政权的高度来认识。
    执行和捍卫毛主席革命路线，是每个干部战士在任何时期的神圣职责。我们要办好毛泽东思想大学校，就要象红九连那样，使广大指战员在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，都能够坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边。
    全军同志们，在纪念毛主席光辉的“五·七”指示发表两周年的时候，我们要进一步学习和贯彻执行毛主席这一伟大指示，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级建党建军路线，坚决贯彻执行林彪副主席关于活学活用毛主席著作、突出无产阶级政治、坚持四个第一、大兴三八作风、发扬三大民主、创造四好连队等一系列着重政治建军的方针原则，在两条路线斗争中，把全军所有连队都办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校！
