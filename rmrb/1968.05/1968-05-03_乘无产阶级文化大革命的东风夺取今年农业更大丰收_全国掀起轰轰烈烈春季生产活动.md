	Riding the Wind of the Cultural Revolution to Achieve Greater Agricultural Harvests This Year
	The Nation Launches a Vigorous Spring Production Campaign

	Hundreds of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres across the country are arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, using revolution to guide production, and are full of vigor and fighting spirit. They are determined to make this year's spring farming even better, and to make new contributions to the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

	Xinhua News Agency, May 2nd: Under the excellent situation of the Cultural Revolution, the hundreds of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in China's countryside are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They are resolutely implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." They are taking class struggle as the key link, carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," and have launched a vigorous spring production campaign. They are determined to achieve even greater harvests in agricultural production this year and to make new contributions to the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

	The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres across the country are seriously studying Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and the New Year's editorial of the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and Liberation Army Daily. They deeply understand that: doing a good job in spring agricultural production is of great significance for achieving greater harvests in agricultural production nationwide this year, for achieving the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution, for implementing Chairman Mao's great strategic decision of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," and for supporting the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. Everyone uses Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything and uses revolution to guide production. They are full of vigor and fighting spirit and are determined to make this year's spring farming even better. In Guangdong Province, where the season is relatively early, due to the good preparation work, by the beginning of April, the early rice has been transplanted on time. The broad masses of commune members in the Yangtze River basin have already plowed the fields, harrowed the land, stored water, and raised seedlings, and are now transplanting early rice on time. In the vast Yellow (Yellow River) and Huai (Huai River) plains, male and female commune members are collecting fertilizer, applying manure, harrowing the land to retain moisture, digging wells and repairing canals, and repairing farm tools. The work is busy everywhere. Now the sorghum has been sown, and the cotton sowing is about to be completed. In the vast Song (Songhua River) and Lia (Liao River) plains, where the season is relatively late, many places have done a solid job in preparation this year, with more fertilizer collected and seeds prepared. Now the spring wheat has been sown, and the sowing of sorghum, corn, and soybeans and other field crops is beginning. The winter wheat across the country has generally grown well after turning green this spring. Now, the broad masses of commune members in the wheat-producing areas are respectively irrigating and fertilizing the wheat fields, determined to achieve a bumper harvest of summer crops.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Holding study classes is a good method. Many problems can be solved in study classes." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres across the country, following Chairman Mao's instructions, take class struggle as the key link and hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes during the busy spring farming period. Many production teams hold study classes in the fields, at work sites, in households, and in courtyards. Everywhere is a large classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice, and everywhere is a battlefield for criticizing and repudiating selfishness and revisionism. In Heilongjiang Province alone, more than eight million commune members and cadres have participated in study classes held by various communes and production teams. In the four prefectures of Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Nantong, and Huaiyin in Jiangsu Province, 250,000 study classes have been held in rural areas, with more than 8.5 million people participating in the study. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, with boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in practice in the study classes, combining spring farming and spring sowing. They fiercely criticize and repudiate the reactionary revisionist fallacies of "class struggle extinction," "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," material incentives, and work points as the key, which were spread by China's Khrushchev and his agents in various places, and launch a fierce attack on the enemies of the proletariat. Many poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres study one of Chairman Mao's quotations, fiercely criticize one of China's Khrushchev's and his local agents' reactionary fallacies, struggle against selfishness once, establish one revolutionary viewpoint, greatly promote the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking, and strongly promote spring farming.

	The great leader Chairman Mao's call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture" has been deeply ingrained in people's hearts. In the spring farming production, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres, with a heart full of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and with a firm grasp of the great Mao Zedong Thought, have launched a wave of learning from Dazhai. They follow the Dazhai path, learn from the Dazhai people, and promote the Dazhai spirit. They take Dazhai as an example, emphasize proletarian politics, carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, and invest in spring farming production. Many places send people to visit and learn from Dazhai, hold Dazhai picture exhibitions, establish Dazhai-style models in their own regions, and hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes with learning from Dazhai as the content, widely publicizing and learning from Dazhai. The broad masses of commune members say, Dazhai is good in a thousand ways, but the best is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in practice; Dazhai's experience is good in a thousand ways, but the most fundamental is to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, this spring, various places, in the activities of learning from Dazhai, all put the learning of Dazhai people's high raising of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in practice, taking class struggle as the key link, and firmly grasping the revolutionary transformation of people in a prominent position. The Hongqing Brigade of Shaojing Commune in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, through holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes with learning from Dazhai as the main content, has greatly carried forward the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai. In the spring production, this brigade fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the people, with men, women, old, and young all participating, and did everything possible to collect and produce fertilizer, solving the problem of insufficient fertilizer. The commune members and cadres said proudly, even if the natural conditions this year are worse than last year, we will still be able to achieve: this year's production will be better than last year, and the contribution to the state will be greater than last year.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "If there is only the enthusiasm of the masses but no strong leading cadres to properly organize the enthusiasm of the masses, then the enthusiasm of the masses will neither be able to last long nor be able to move in the correct direction and reach a higher level." Many provincial and regional leadership organs, following Chairman Mao's instructions, held meetings in January and February on how to grasp revolution and promote production, implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and carried out the central government's policies on agricultural production. With the establishment of revolutionary committees at various levels in various places, many regions have strengthened and reinforced the leading cadres at various levels for production, and have strengthened the leadership of spring production. The revolutionary committees at various levels in various places also sent many Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams or teams for grasping revolution and promoting production to the front lines of spring farming, where they live, eat, and work with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and together study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in practice, and together do a good job in spring farming. The central ministries of industry, commerce, agriculture, and forestry also sent Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams or teams to support spring farming, water conservancy work teams, etc., to various rural areas, assisting local leadership organs, further publicizing and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and promoting spring farming.

	The People's Liberation Army, which has made new contributions to the people in the Cultural Revolution, continues to carry forward the glorious tradition of being a fighting force, a working force, and a production force in this year's spring production. Since the beginning of spring, the support farming units and Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams of the People's Liberation Army have been active on the front lines of spring farming in various places. The broad masses of soldiers and officers, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, actively help commune members hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and together with the commune members, fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary great criticism, and strongly promote the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking. The broad masses of soldiers and officers also actively help commune members collect and transport fertilizer, sow and transplant, build water conservancy projects, and repair agricultural machinery, strongly supporting spring farming, and receiving the enthusiastic praise of the commune members.

　　乘无产阶级文化大革命的东风夺取今年农业更大丰收
　　全国掀起轰轰烈烈春季生产活动
    亿万贫下中农和革命干部用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，用革命统帅生产，意气风发，斗志昂扬，决心把春耕生产搞得好上加好，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利做出新贡献
    新华社二日讯　在无产阶级文化大革命的一片大好形势下，我国农村亿万贫下中农和革命干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，以阶级斗争为纲，发扬“只争朝夕”的革命精神，掀起轰轰烈烈的春季生产活动，决心夺取今年农业生产的更大丰收，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利做出新的贡献。
    我国广大贫下中农和农村干部认真学习毛主席的一系列最新指示，认真学习《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》一九六八年元旦社论，深刻地认识到：搞好春季农业生产，对于夺取今年全国农业生产的更大丰收，对于夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，对于实现毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略决策，对于支援世界人民的革命斗争，都具有极其重大的意义。大家用毛泽东思想统帅一切，用革命统帅生产，意气风发，斗志昂扬，决心把春耕生产搞得好上加好。季节较早的广东省，由于备耕工作做得好，到四月上旬已经适时栽完早稻；长江流域的广大社员已经犁好田，耙好地，蓄好水，育好秧，正在适时地栽插早稻；辽阔的黄（黄河）淮（淮河）平原，男女社员积肥送粪，耙地保墒，打井修渠，修置农具，一片繁忙，现在高粱已经播完，棉花播种正在扫尾；季节较晚的松（松花江）辽（辽河）平原，今年许多地区备耕工作搞得扎扎实实，肥料积得多，种子备得齐，现在春小麦已经播完，正在开始播种高粱、玉米和大豆等大田作物。全国各地的越冬小麦，今春返青后，一般生长良好，现在产麦区的广大社员正分别给麦田浇水、追肥，决心夺取夏收作物的大丰收。
    毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”全国各地广大贫下中农和革命干部，遵照毛主席的教导，以阶级斗争为纲，在春耕大忙期间坚持大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。许多生产队把学习班办到田头、工地，办到家庭、院落，到处都是活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂，到处都是斗私批修的战场。仅黑龙江省，参加各社队举办的学习班的社员和干部即达八百万人以上。江苏省苏州、镇江、南通、淮阴四个专区的农村已办学习班二十五万期，参加学习的有八百五十多万人次。广大贫下中农和革命干部怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限忠诚，在学习班里，活学活用毛泽东思想，结合春耕春播，狠揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派及其在本地区的代理人所散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论和“三自一包”、“四大自由”、物质刺激、工分挂帅等反革命修正主义谬论，向无产阶级的敌人发起猛烈的进攻。很多贫下中农和革命干部，学习毛主席一条语录，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在当地代理人的一个反动谬论，猛斗一次私心，树立一个革命观点，大大地促进了人的思想革命化，有力地推动了春耕生产。
    伟大领袖毛主席的“农业学大寨”的伟大号召，更加深入人心。在春耕生产中，广大贫下中农和农村干部，对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对伟大的毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，掀起了学大寨的热潮。他们走大寨路，学大寨人，兴大寨风，以大寨为榜样，突出无产阶级政治，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，投入春耕生产。许多地区派人到大寨参观访问，举办大寨图片展览，树立本地区大寨式的典型以及开办以学大寨为内容的毛泽东思想学习班，广泛地宣传和学习大寨。广大社员说，大寨千好万好，活学活用毛主席著作最好；大寨经验千条万条，毛泽东思想挂帅是最根本的一条。因此，今春各地在学习大寨的活动中，都把学习大寨人的高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，以阶级斗争为纲，狠抓人的思想革命化，摆在突出地位。江苏省太仓县沙溪公社洪泾大队，通过举办以学大寨为主要内容的毛泽东思想学习班，大大发扬了大寨的革命精神。在春季生产中，这个大队充分发挥人的积极因素，男女老少齐出动，千方百计地积肥、造肥，解决了肥料不足的困难。社员、干部豪迈地说，即使今年自然条件比去年差，我们也要做到：今年的生产要好于去年，对国家贡献大于去年。
    毛主席教导说：“如果只有广大群众的积极性，而无有力的领导骨干去恰当地组织群众的积极性，则群众积极性既不可能持久，也不可能走向正确的方向和提到高级的程度。”许多省、区的领导机构，遵照毛主席的教导，在今年一、二月份先后召开了有关抓革命、促生产的会议，落实毛主席的最新指示，贯彻中央有关农业生产的方针政策。随着各地各级革命委员会的建立，许多地区充实和加强了各级生产领导班子，对春季生产加强了领导。各地各级革命委员会还派出很多毛泽东思想宣传队或抓革命、促生产工作小组，深入到春耕生产第一线，同广大贫下中农共同活学活用毛泽东思想，同吃同住同劳动，共同搞好春耕。中央工交、财贸、农林等部门也派出了毛泽东思想宣传队或支援春耕小组、水利工作组等到各地农村，协助当地领导部门，进一步宣传、落实毛主席的最新指示，推动春耕生产。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中为人民立下新功的人民解放军，在今年的春季生产中继续发扬既是战斗队又是工作队又是生产队的光荣传统。入春以来，人民解放军的支农部队和毛泽东思想宣传队，一直活跃在各地春耕生产第一线。广大指战员以毛主席的最新指示为纲，积极帮助社员举办毛泽东思想学习班，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，和社员一道斗私批修，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，有力地促进了人的思想革命化。广大指战员还积极帮助社员积肥送粪，播种插秧，兴修水利，检修农机具，有力地支援了春耕生产，受到了社员的热烈称赞。
