　　Tokyo Student Rally Against Persecution of Japanese Police Met with Brutal Beatings and Arrests
    Over Twenty Students Injured, Hundreds Arrested
    [Xinhua News Agency, 20th] The reactionary Yoshida government of Japan is wantonly persecuting students who oppose the "rectification" of progressive professors. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo: Students from various universities in Tokyo held a rally on the 17th on the campus of Waseda University to protest the Yoshida government's conspiracy to "rectify" progressive professors. The Japanese reactionaries dispatched more than eight hundred police officers, forcing the students to disperse and subjecting them to brutal beatings and arrests. According to Kyodo News, more than twenty students were injured, and one hundred and forty-three were arrested. All of the arrested students were unreasonably sent to the Tokyo District Court for trial on the 19th.
    Prior to this, students from many universities in Tokyo had held rallies and strikes to oppose the "rectification" of progressive professors. At that time, they were subjected to the tyrannical interference of school authorities and the police, and afterwards, many students were unreasonably expelled.
