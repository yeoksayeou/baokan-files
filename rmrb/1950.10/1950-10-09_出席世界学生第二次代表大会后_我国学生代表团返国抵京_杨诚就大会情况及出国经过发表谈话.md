Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The Chinese student delegation, consisting of 43 members including the delegation's soccer team, returned to Beijing on the 5th, after attending the Second World Student Congress held in Prague this August. Yang Cheng, the head of the delegation, gave a talk on the situation of the congress and the trip abroad, as follows:

　　This congress, hosted by the International Union of Students, is a major event in the international student movement. The International Union of Students, which has grown in the struggle to defend world peace, has faithfully fulfilled its charter for four years and has won the support of students all over the world, having become the only powerful international student organization with more than five million members in seventy-one countries. At a time when world peace is seriously threatened, the congress focused on calling on students around the world to unite and fight to defend peace and to strive for national independence and democratic education. The congress also severely condemned the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Korea and unanimously praised and supported the heroic struggle of the Korean people and students for independence, freedom, and unification. The convening of this congress was disrupted and obstructed by reactionaries, such as U.S. imperialism hindering Japanese students from participating and threatening American democratic students; reactionary representatives from some Western European countries tried their best to attack and slander the International Union of Students, attempting to split world student unity; but with the support of the vast majority of democratic student representatives, the reactionaries' conspiracy was finally smashed. At the congress, the Chinese delegation firmly supported the past work of the International Union of Students, and pointed out that after the Chinese people's revolution, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the political status and the right to education of students had been fundamentally changed. At present, students across the country are actively studying and striving to build a new China and defend world peace. The speech by the Chinese delegation was warmly welcomed by all the representatives. When it was suggested that the International Union of Students establish an international student sanatorium in China, representatives from all countries, especially colonial representatives, applauded enthusiastically in agreement, and expressed their deep concern for the liberated Chinese students and their gratitude for the friendship of students from various countries.

　　The congress lasted for seventeen days. After the congress, the delegation was invited to visit the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, and successively visited schools, factories, exhibitions, museums and various scenic spots in twenty-one towns including Moscow, Leningrad, and Prague, and attended various mass rallies; in addition to participating in the sports competitions organized by the congress, the delegation's soccer team also played friendly matches in various parts of Czechoslovakia and, at the invitation, in cities such as Bucharest, the capital of Romania. The above activities lasted for a total of twenty-seven days. Wherever we went, we were warmly welcomed and kindly received by the people, youth, and students of all countries. In particular, our Soviet friends were deeply concerned about the delegation's activities and tirelessly helped us understand and learn from their experience, fully demonstrating the great and profound friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. During the visits, we received a wealth of internationalist education, and at the same time, we deeply realized that due to the great victory of the people's revolution led by Chairman Mao, China's international status abroad has been unprecedentedly enhanced. In the future, we must more highly promote the spirit of patriotism and internationalism.

　　We are now preparing to report the achievements of this congress, the task of defending world peace put forward by the congress, and our experiences abroad to students across the country, and together with students across the country, we will study harder to build a new China.

　　出席世界学生第二次代表大会后
    我国学生代表团返国抵京
    杨诚就大会情况及出国经过发表谈话
    【新华社八日讯】出席今年八月在布拉格召开的世界学生第二次代表大会的中国学生代表团及代表团球队一行四十三人，于五日回国抵达北京。代表团团长杨诚就此次大会情况及出国经过发表谈话如下：
    国际学生联合会所主持的这次大会是国际学生运动中的一个重大事件。在保卫世界和平的斗争中成长起来的国际学联，四年来忠实履行会章，深获全世界学生的拥护，已经成为拥有七十一个国家五百余万会员的唯一强大的国际学生组织。在目前世界和平遭受严重威胁之际，大会着重号召世界学生团结一致，为保卫和平，争取民族独立与民主教育而斗争。大会并严厉地斥责美国帝国主义侵略朝鲜的罪行，一致赞扬与支持朝鲜人民与学生为独立、自由与统一而进行的英勇斗争。此次大会的召开曾遭到反动派的破坏与阻挠，如美国帝国主义阻挠日本学生参加，威胁美国民主学生；西欧若干国家的反动代表竭力攻击和诬蔑国际学联，企图分裂世界学生团结；但在绝大多数民主学生代表支持下，终于粉碎了反动派的阴谋。中国代表团在大会上坚决拥护国际学联过去的工作，并指出中国人民革命在毛主席、共产党英明领导下获得伟大胜利后，学生的政治地位和受教育权利根本改观。目前全国学生正积极学习，全力为建设新中国与保卫世界和平而奋斗。中国代表团的发言受到全体代表热烈的欢迎。当建议国际学联在中国成立国际学生疗养院时，各国代表特别是殖民地代表热烈鼓掌赞同，并对解放了的中国学生深切关心各国同学的友谊表示感谢。
    大会活动共十七天。大会闭幕后，代表团应邀访问了苏联和捷克，先后参观了莫斯科、列宁格勒、布拉格等二十一个城镇的学校、工厂、展览会、博物馆及各名胜区，出席了各种群众大会；代表团球队除参加大会组织的体育比赛外，并在捷克各地、及应邀到罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特等城市作友谊比赛。以上活动，共计历时二十七天。所到之处，受到各国人民、青年、学生的热烈欢迎和亲切接待。特别是苏联朋友深切地关怀代表团的活动，不疲倦地帮助我们了解和学习他们的经验，充分表现了中苏两国人民伟大深厚的友谊。在参观和访问中，使我们受到了丰富的国际主义教育，同时我们深深体会到：由于毛主席所领导的人民革命的伟大胜利，中国在国外的国际地位是空前提高了。我们今后要更高度地发扬爱国主义和国际主义精神。
    我们现在准备把这次大会的成果、大会提出的保卫世界和平的任务、以及国外见闻报告给全国同学，并且和全国同学一道为建设新中国而更加努力地学习。
