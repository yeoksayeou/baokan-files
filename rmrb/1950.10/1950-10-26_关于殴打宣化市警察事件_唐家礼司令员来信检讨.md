　　Regarding the Incident of Assaulting Police Officers in Xuanhua City:
    Commander Tang Jiali's Letter of Self-Criticism
    Comrades Editors:
    The matter of my dispute with the police in Xuanhua City was published in the People's Forum on June 10th. I am now informing you of my self-criticism.
    On the morning of May 11th, I accompanied the troops to the brick kiln outside the South Gate to carry bricks. Around 5 PM, as I was riding my bicycle back, passing through the South Gate, the gate police officer asked me to dismount. I thought, why should I dismount to pass through the gate? After passing, the police officer then said, "Why don't you have a license plate?" I thought this was a matter of regulations, so I dismounted and explained, "Because I don't often ride my bicycle out, and I haven't seen any notices. My surname is Tang." But he still wouldn't let me go. I then said, "I am the commander. If you don't believe me, you can come with me to the Chahar Southern Military District Command for proof." The police officer said, "I don't care who you are! You can't pass without a license plate." He then grabbed the back of the bicycle and wouldn't let go. I was emotionally agitated at the time and said a few swear words, and then tried to pull his hand away. He wouldn't let go, so I slapped his hand a couple of times. When someone from the Municipal Public Security Bureau came to talk to me, Chief of Staff Yang, fearing my approach wasn't appropriate, immediately went to handle the matter on my behalf, mediating from the side, without telling me; thereby also causing a misunderstanding.
    After the incident, I made a public self-criticism at a meeting of cadres above the platoon level in the Chahar Southern Military District, and also made a self-criticism to the Chahar Provincial Party Committee and the Chahar Provincial Military District, requesting punishment. I believe that my swearing was a serious mistake, a manifestation of the remnants of warlordism, and a violation of party and military discipline. At the time, I did not consider my proper attitude, and the negative consequences my erroneous behavior would cause, damaging the political influence of our party and our army. This fact proves that my own cultivation and training are not enough. I have now recognized this mistake, and I will resolutely correct it; I guarantee that I will not repeat it in the future. Having learned this lesson, I will always be vigilant, study hard, strengthen my cultivation and training, and improve myself. I hope everyone can help me and supervise me.
                        Tang Jiali

### 关于殴打宣化市警察事件  唐家礼司令员来信检讨

　　关于殴打宣化市警察事件
    唐家礼司令员来信检讨
    编辑同志：
    我和宣化市警察发生纠纷一事，已在六月十日的人民园地上发表了。现在把我的检讨告诉你们。
    五月十一日上午，我随部队到南城外砖窑去背砖。下午五点多钟，我骑车子回来路过南门时，门岗警察要我下车。我认为骑车过门何必下车子呢？过去了后，警察又说：“你怎么没有车牌子呢？”我认为这是法令问题，即下了车，并向他解释说：“因为我不常骑车子出门，也没有见过通知。我姓唐。”但他还不放我走。我又说：“我是司令员，你如果不相信，可与我到察南分区司令部去证明。”警察说：“我管你是谁？车子没牌过不去。”即将车子后部捉住不放。我当时感情冲动，就骂了几句，又去拉开他的手。他不放手，我即在他手上甩打了两下。当市公安局来人找我谈话时，杨参谋长恐我方式不好，当即前去代为接洽，从中调解，没有告诉我；从而也引起了误会。
    事情发生后，我即在察南分区排以上干部会上作了公开检讨，同时又向中共察哈尔省委和察哈尔省军区作了检讨，请求处分。我认为我骂人是严重的错误，是军阀主义残余的表现，是违犯党纪军纪的行为。我当时没有考虑到自己的应有态度，以及由于我这种错误行为会引起不良结果，损害我党我军的政治影响。这一事实证明我自己的修养锻炼还不够。我现已认识了这一错误，我一定坚决地改正；保证今后不再重犯。有了这一次的教训，我当随时警惕自己，努力学习，加强修养锻炼，提高自己。我希望大家能够帮助我，监督我。
