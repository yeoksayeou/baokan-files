　　Northeast Region Model Workers' Representatives Write to Northeast
    Reporting on the Grand Occasion of the Journey and the Conference, Expressing Determination to Work Hard in Production
    [This Newspaper News] All the Labor Model Representatives from Northeast China wrote a letter back to Northeast, reporting on the grand occasion of the journey and the conference, and expressing their determination to work hard in the future. The original letter is as follows:
    To all workers, peasants, and People's Liberation Army comrades in Northeast China:
    With your support and assistance, we have the honor of participating in the National Congress of Combat Heroes and National Model Workers of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers. At each station on the way to Beijing, we received a warm welcome from the people. Upon arriving in Tianjin, we were warmly received by the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Government, and various people's organizations. When we arrived in Fengtai, we joined forces with heroes from all over the country. Everyone, with a warm and excited heart, took the Mao Zedong locomotive to Beijing. As soon as we got off the train, the Central People's Government organized a grand mass welcome rally. Vice Premier Dong, Secretary-General Lin, Acting Chief of General Staff Nie, and heads of various ministries personally welcomed us at the station and gave speeches. The warm flower offerings from people's organizations in the capital made us infinitely happy. This is the glory of all the people of Northeast China!
    We saw our most beloved leader Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu with our own eyes at the opening ceremony on the 25th. And we personally presented the gifts you gave to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.
    At the opening ceremony, Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Vice Premier Chen Yun personally gave speeches, instructing us not to be arrogant, but to unite with all the people to build a strong national defense force and economic power. Later, Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Acting Chief of General Staff Nie, Vice Chairman of the Central Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Committee Li Fuchun, and Minister of Agriculture Li Shucheng also made reports. All of our combat hero representatives and labor model representatives resolutely responded to the call of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and swore to Chairman Mao, the leaders of the Northeast Party, government, and military region, and the people of Northeast China: Under the leadership of the Party and the government: First, we must overcome arrogance and rashness, humbly learn from the advanced experiences of the whole country, learn new technologies, and build our strong national defense force. Cooperate with our brotherly troops to liberate Taiwan and Tibet as soon as possible, liberate all the territory, defend the motherland, eliminate all bandits and special agents, defend our sacred and inviolable borders, and defend world peace. Second, unite the entire working class, give full play to the labor enthusiasm of the masters of the country, continue to carry out the new record movement, increase production, improve quality, reduce costs, improve business management, and ensure the completion and surpassing of the major and glorious tasks assigned to us by the state. Third, we must take the lead in uniting and organizing the peasants, widely organize cooperatives and mutual aid groups, learn new agricultural technologies, change old operating methods, and take the lead in using and promoting new agricultural tools to improve our agricultural production. During our meeting, we received letters from many workers such as the Fushun Federation of Trade Unions, Jilin Chemical Plant, as well as troops and rural areas, saying that you are taking practical actions to create greater achievements on the production front to celebrate the National Congress of Combat Heroes and Model Workers of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, and to celebrate our great National Day, which gave us great encouragement. At the same time, during the meeting, we also heard the news of the US imperialism bombing Andong. All of our representatives were extremely angry and unanimously issued a protest against the heinous crimes of US imperialism.
    Dear comrades workers, peasants, and soldiers, let us unite closely under the banner of our great leader Chairman Mao, to build our strong national defense force, to build our strong economic power, to resist the shameless aggression of US imperialism, to defend the freedom, happiness, and honor of our great motherland and people, and to strive to fully realize Chairman Mao's instructions! We extend our warmest greetings to you!
      Signed by all combat hero representatives and all labor model representatives of workers, peasants and soldiers in the Northeast Region, September 28
