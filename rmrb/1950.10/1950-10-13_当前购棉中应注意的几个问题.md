Several Issues to Note in the Current Cotton Procurement
	Ye Jixiu, Liu Wei

According to materials from the National Cotton Production Work Conference recently convened by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government: This year, the country has sown over 60.25 million mu of cotton fields. Excluding the 4.5 million mu of cotton fields that have suffered reduced production or been converted to other crops due to natural disasters such as floods, droughts, pests, and hail, the remaining 56.76 million mu of cotton fields are laden with bolls, and the cotton bolls are large, representing a rare bumper harvest in recent years. It is estimated that the country can produce over 14 million dan of ginned cotton this year. Compared with last year's national cotton production of over 9.07 million dan (excluding figures from the Northeast and Southwest regions, last year's national cotton production was 8.5 million dan), this represents an increase of over 55.4 percent, exceeding this year's original plan of 13.28 million dan of cotton by more than 5.4 percent.

Of the aforementioned 14 million dan of ginned cotton, after deducting the amount needed for farmers' self-use and hand-spinning, it is estimated that over 10 million dan will be available to meet the production needs of the national machine cotton textile industry, an increase of about double compared to the amount purchased by public and private entities since last autumn. According to past experience, every year from October to the end of January of the following year (i.e., the end of the old lunar year) is the season when new cotton is heavily marketed, with the amount marketed generally accounting for 50 to 60 percent of the total amount sold by farmers. Therefore, the currently commenced task of purchasing cotton is arduous and urgent. This year's cotton purchase differs completely from last year's in that national prices are basically stable; the branch institutions of the state-owned China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and the organizations of cooperatives in various regions are more widespread than last year; and the policy and business skills of cadres and their practical experience in cotton purchasing have also improved compared to last year. The above circumstances provide more favorable conditions for this year's cotton purchase work than before. However, because this year's purchase task is very large, some new difficulties may arise in implementing the purchase work. To prevent or overcome the possible difficulties in the current cotton purchase work and successfully complete the purchase task, what issues should we pay attention to?

First: The Issue of Cotton Purchase Price Policy

Whether or not we can correctly grasp the reasonable parity between cotton and grain and implement the cotton purchase price policy is a fundamental issue in cotton purchase work. This is because it not only relates to the vital interests of cotton farmers, affects the completion of the purchase task and the supply of raw materials needed for the national cotton textile industry, but also plays a decisive role in further increasing cotton production in the future. The significant achievement of this year's national cotton production is not accidental; in addition to the even distribution of rainfall and timely sowing, the most important reason is that the government adopted a correct price policy, promptly issued a circular on reasonable parity between cotton and grain, and stipulated that cotton could be used to pay public grain; the leading organs of major administrative regions also promulgated various measures to protect the interests of cotton farmers and reward cotton planting, and used a large amount of financial resources, materials, and cadres to help farmers, eliminating the ideological concerns of individual cotton farmers about cotton planting and solving the practical difficulties of farmers in cotton planting.

In the past year of cotton purchase work, most regions across the country generally implemented the central government's regulations on the reasonable parity of cotton and grain. For example, in the North China region, through the North China State-owned Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and cooperatives, in the purchase of last year's cotton, the general price was one jin of medium-grade ginned cotton (14/16 inch) exchanged for eight jin of millet, and in some areas it even reached about ten jin, thus effectively protecting the interests of cotton farmers and playing a very significant role in the over-fulfillment of this year's cotton production plan. However, in individual regions, due to insufficient attention to price policy, or due to insufficient preparation of purchase funds and physical resources in advance, farmers were unable to promptly buy back what they urgently needed (such as grain, cloth, and other necessities) after selling cotton, or when cotton was heavily marketed, they failed to purchase it in large quantities in time, causing cotton prices to fall and arousing dissatisfaction among local farmers. In the spring of this year, some farmers in individual regions even uprooted the planted cotton seedlings and planted other crops due to excessively low cotton prices and the lack of buyers. Therefore, correctly grasping the reasonable parity between cotton and grain stipulated by the government and implementing the cotton purchase price policy will play a decisive role in doing a good job in the current cotton purchase work.

At present, in some areas, due to the bumper harvest of autumn grain and the increase in the amount of grain marketed, there has been a phenomenon of falling grain prices and relatively high cotton prices. For example, in Shijiazhuang and Xinxiang in North China, one jin of cotton can be exchanged for twelve or even fourteen jin of millet; in Hankou, each jin of cotton can be exchanged for more than ten jin of rice. In other areas, such as Linqing, Hebei, due to the large number of new cotton arrivals, public and private manufacturers have come to the area to purchase it; due to the lack of unified prices, some purchase prices are too high (new cotton is purchased as old cotton), resulting in competitive purchases and causing temporary chaos in the local market and rising grain and cloth prices. The destruction of the grain-cotton parity, resulting in excessively high cotton prices and fluctuating grain prices, not only hinders the smooth completion of the cotton purchase task, but also affects the increase in yarn and cloth production costs, which is not only unfavorable to textile production, but also unfavorable to the vast number of farmers. Therefore, these phenomena must be closely watched and overcome as soon as possible by various regions, and effective measures should be taken to avoid their recurrence in the future, and resolutely implement the price policy of the Central People's Government on cotton purchase.

Second: The Issue of Purchase Organizations and Their Coordination

Cotton purchase work must be carried out in an organized manner. First, the state-owned China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and its branches in various regions should be well combined with local cooperatives to carry out purchases. Second, in cities concentrated with textile industries across the country, public and private yarn mills should be organized to carry out joint purchases simultaneously.

In the past year, the cotton purchased by the state-owned China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company accounted for more than 70 percent of the total amount purchased by public and private entities nationwide. This is because, in the purchase, they have generally had good cooperation with cooperatives, purchased cotton through cooperatives (taking the North China region from September to December last year as an example: the amount of cotton purchased by cooperatives on behalf of the company accounted for 40 percent of the total purchase amount of the company in the region), and widely organized members to gin cotton for production. However, in some other places, because the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company did not closely cooperate with the cooperatives, they sometimes gave less or even no state purchase funds to the cooperatives, but gave more or all of them to private merchants. In individual places, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company even used private merchants to control the cooperatives; some even abused private merchants to purchase cotton everywhere, squeezing together with the situation where many farmers at the time sold rice to buy cotton, causing temporary chaos in the cotton market, resulting in fluctuating cotton prices and reduced cotton quality. Some even resulted in excessively high cotton prices, so that the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company had to sell cotton to stabilize prices, and farmers bought cotton from the company to pay public grain to the government, creating extremely unreasonable waste in the cotton purchase work and affecting the better completion of the purchase task. These facts prove that in the cotton purchase work, the close combination of the state-owned China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and cooperatives is the main link to ensure the implementation of the cotton price policy, effectively protect the interests of cotton farmers, and successfully complete the state purchase plan.

In the process of combining the state-owned China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and cooperatives for cotton purchase, phenomena in which opinions on the handling of certain issues were not consistent or practices were not coordinated enough have occurred in the past and may still occur in the future; however, both parties should adopt an attitude of criticism and self-criticism, jointly discuss handling methods, or resolve them uniformly through their respective organizational systems through leadership.

The state-owned China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and cooperatives should fully adopt the contract system in their combined cotton purchase work, in order to clarify the responsibilities of both parties in the cotton collection and to facilitate cooperation in cotton purchase under unified planning and leadership. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and cooperatives in various regions should, in accordance with the agreement on cotton purchase signed by the Ministry of Trade of the Central Government and the National Cooperative Federation, formulate specific contracts for each region; once the contracts are signed, both parties must strictly implement them.

In some newly liberated areas, the branch institutions of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company there have yet to be established, and the organizations of cooperatives there are not sound or there are no cooperative organizations at all. In this case, when necessary, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company can also entrust private merchants to purchase part of the cotton it intends to purchase on its behalf. According to past experience, entrusted purchases by private merchants must be done with cash on delivery and cleared on the same day, and constant attention must be paid to inspection and supervision to prevent speculation by individual unscrupulous merchants. When the Central and Southern China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company entrusted private merchants to purchase cotton on its behalf in the autumn of last year, due to the bureaucracy of some cadres, they did not understand the entrusted private merchants in advance, nor did they pay attention to inspection and supervision. As a result, after handing over a large amount of funds to the private merchants, not only did they fail to receive cotton on schedule, but the funds paid were not recovered in time. Until July of this year, more than 2,700 dan of cotton were still outstanding, causing great losses to the state.

In addition to the aforementioned close combination of the state-owned China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and cooperatives for purchase, it is also necessary to learn from the experience of Shanghai last year and universally promote the organization of public-private joint purchases. That is, in cities concentrated with textile industries across the country, joint cotton purchase organizations of public and private yarn mills should be organized as much as possible, and under the responsible leadership of the local trade administrative department and the Textile Administration Bureau, on the principle of overall planning and consideration, unified cotton purchase plans should be formulated, funds should be raised, and raw cotton should be distributed according to the proportion of investment.

Such organized and planned purchase and distribution of raw cotton can prevent blind competitive purchases or imbalances in the supply and demand of raw cotton, as well as unstable fluctuations in cotton prices and other adverse phenomena, which is conducive to promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and the restoration and development of the national textile industry.

Third: The Issue of Market Leadership and Management

This year, the amount of cotton purchased is quite large, and cotton farmers need to purchase some means of livelihood and production after selling cotton; therefore, if sufficient material preparations are not made in advance to support the cotton purchase market and market management is not strengthened, it is likely to cause temporary market chaos and price fluctuations in some areas or individual cities. Recently, in Linqing, Hebei, state-owned specialized companies such as Cotton Yarn and Cloth, Department Store, and Grain failed to fully understand and estimate the market supply and demand of materials in advance. When farmers sold cotton and purchased a large amount of grain and other goods, they suddenly felt that the material strength prepared was insufficient. After the city's Grain Company sold out the old wheat, it stopped posting price tags because the new wheat could not be supplied, causing market chaos and price fluctuations in the city for a time. Similar situations have also occurred in other places, such as Wu'an County in Hebei, and Houma and Yuncheng in southern Shanxi, in recent cotton collection. Therefore, in order to maintain price stability and avoid market chaos in the current large-scale cotton collection work, our professional companies in various regions must have sufficient material preparations and must strengthen leadership and management of the market.

First of all, state-owned specialized companies must use a large amount of physical objects to support this cotton purchase work, sell materials in coordination with the cotton collection task to withdraw currency, and maintain price stability. The Ministry of Trade of the Central Government, based on the current basic stability of national prices and estimates of the operating materials of various specialized companies and the needs of the people, issued instructions on September 1, determining that the goods operated by various specialized companies must be prepared in kind in proportion to the amount of currency invested by the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company in cotton collection. Among them, grain preparation must be increased according to the local grain demand level in the months when autumn grain has not been marketed in large quantities and in key cotton purchase areas where cotton is planted particularly heavily (such as Linqing and Handan in North China) and where autumn grain harvests are poor (such as southern Shanxi and Guanzhong), in order to maintain a reasonable parity between cotton and grain and implement the central government's cotton price policy. Other various material preparations must also strive to meet the actual needs of cotton-producing areas. Therefore, in the process of material preparation, various specialized companies must combine the specific requirements of local farmers, conduct in-depth and meticulous investigation and research, and specifically determine the variety, quantity, and quality of prepared materials in order to meet sales. For selling prices, unified and strict regulations must be made in order to avoid market chaos and fluctuations.

Secondly, in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Trade of the Central Government, we should encourage cotton merchants in various regions to participate in the aforementioned public-private joint cotton purchase organization, or organize their own cotton merchant joint purchases; local trade administrative departments and state-owned China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company should provide practical assistance to private merchants participating in the joint purchase organization. Public and private manufacturers in various regions participating in the joint purchase organization should all obey the leadership and management of the trade administrative department of the production area in cotton purchase. The government should provide guidance and assistance to those who abide by government policies and laws. In some larger key cotton distribution markets, depending on the specific circumstances, a cotton purchase committee can be formed jointly with local and foreign manufacturers and joint purchase organizations to control market prices and avoid blind competitive purchases.

At the same time, it is necessary to resolutely implement Article 37 of the Common Program regarding commerce: "The freedom of domestic trade shall be implemented within the unified economic plan of the state. However, speculative commerce that disrupts the market must be strictly prohibited." Therefore, all legitimate private manufacturers who do not participate in the joint purchase organization can freely purchase cotton in the production area; as long as they abide by all the regulations of the local government on market management and cotton price policy, the local government should also provide convenience and guidance. Only those improper cotton merchants who engage in reducing quality, raising market prices, disrupting the market, speculating, and adulterating water and impurities in cotton when purchasing cotton should be banned by the local government in accordance with the law.

Fourth: The Issue of Inspection and Grading

The raw cotton needed by the machine cotton textile industry must have a certain quality and fiber length; otherwise, cotton yarn of a certain quality cannot be spun. In the past, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the quality of cotton produced in our country was mostly not suitable for the requirements of machine textile; due to the lack of strict and universal inspection and grading work, as well as the improper behavior of cotton collection merchants such as adulterating water and impurities, many cotton flowers were not distinguished by coarse or fine, fiber length was not distinguished, various colors were mixed together, and the moisture and impurity content was very serious, with some reaching 30 to 40 percent. This is not only unfavorable to textile industry production and the improvement of the variety and quality of cotton in our country, but also unfavorable to the vast number of consumers because it cannot produce yarn and cloth of a certain quality. In order to ensure that the collected cotton is suitable for machine textile and to gradually achieve the goal of improving cotton varieties in our country through grading and seed selection, various regions must strictly implement the inspection and grading of cotton and grade price differences in cotton purchase work, and implement the policy of good cotton at a good price.

Since last year, the state-owned China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and local cooperatives in various regions have generally strictly implemented inspection and grading and grade price differences in their combined cotton purchase work, basically ensuring the quality of dryness, whiteness, cleanliness, and long fluff; some regions have also directly purchased seed cotton from farmers in large quantities, which not only reduced intermediate exploitation, but also played a significant role in improving cotton quality, so that the cotton collected in the past year basically met the requirements of industrial production. However, some cadres have not paid enough attention to this work, believing that this is an "unnecessary trouble," and some also have a simple view of bestowal, thinking that this is not good for farmers (?), so they have shown that they are not serious and earnest in the implementation of this work. The phenomenon of adulterating water and impurities is still quite common in some areas. According to the statistics of the Central and Southern China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company from November last year to June this year, among the more than 274,000 dan of cotton inspected, the impurity content of some even reached 13 percent, and the highest moisture content reached 20 percent. Therefore, in the current cotton purchase work, the issue of inspection and grading and grade price differences must still be closely watched by various regions.

The vast number of farmers and some private merchants in our country do not clearly understand the importance of this issue. This is because they have not had this habit for a long time and lack technical knowledge and practical experience in this area. Therefore, in the implementation of inspection and grading work, some obstacles and difficulties may be encountered. Therefore, first of all, we should conduct extensive and patient publicity and explanation to cotton farmers and cotton merchants through the local government in conjunction with the purchase, so that they understand that the poor quality of cotton is not only unfavorable to urban industry, but also harmful to themselves. The illegal acts of individual private merchants who artificially adulterate water and impurities in cotton should be strictly prohibited. Secondly, in the implementation of inspection and grading, due to the uneven technical level of inspection and grading among cadres, there may be a phenomenon of inconsistent standards for inspecting cotton quality, which should also be avoided as much as possible. Recently, this situation occurred in Handan, Hebei: the inspection technical level of cotton collection cadres in the city was higher, while the inspection technical level of cotton collection cadres in the suburbs of the city was lower. When farmers took the same cotton to Handan City for sale, it was sold as 13/16 inch ginned cotton, while in the suburbs of Handan, it was inspected as 14/16 inch medium-grade ginned cotton, which aroused dissatisfaction among some cotton farmers. Therefore, cotton collection cadres in various regions, in addition to improving their understanding of inspection work, should also pay attention to strengthening their learning of inspection technology. Because only in this way can we gradually eradicate the phenomenon of artificially reducing cotton quality, improve the variety and quality of cotton, and make the cotton produced in our country fully suitable for the requirements of the cotton textile industry.

At present, new cotton has been heavily marketed one after another in various regions, and large-scale purchase work has begun. According to the number of spindles nationwide, the amount of new cotton that can be purchased this year can generally be used; if estimated according to the sales of yarn and cloth and the people's purchasing power, this number can also meet the needs of the people across the country. As long as we can pay attention to the above issues in the future purchase work, we believe that this year's cotton purchase work will achieve greater results than in the past, thus guaranteeing the raw material supply of the national cotton textile industry and the needs of the people across the country for cotton textile products, and creating more favorable conditions for further increasing cotton production in the future.

　　当前购棉中应注意的几个问题
    叶际秀　刘为
    根据中央人民政府农业部最近召开的全国棉产工作会议的材料：今年全国共播种棉田六千零二十五万余亩，除去其中因受水、旱、虫、雹等自然灾害而致减产或改种其他作物的四百五十万亩棉田不计外，其余五千六百七十六万余亩棉田则结桃累累，棉桃硕大，为数年来罕有的丰收。预计今年全国共可产皮棉一千四百余万市担，和去年全国产棉九百零七万余担（除东北、西南两区数字外，则去年全国棉产为八百五十万担）相较，增加了百分之五十五点四强，超过今年原计划全国生产棉花一千三百二十八万担的百分之五点四以上。
    在上述一千四百余万担的皮棉产量中，除农民自用及手工纺织所需用者外；估计将有一千万担以上可供全国机器棉纺织工业的生产需用，与去年秋季以来公私收购数量比较，约增加一倍左右。根据过去的经验，每年自十月至翌年一月底（即旧历年终）以前，是新棉大量上市的季节，上市数量一般要占到农民全部出售量的百分之五十到六十。因此，现已开始的收购棉花任务是繁重而急迫的。今年收购棉花和去年一个完全不同的情况，是全国物价基本稳定；国营花纱布公司在全国各地的分支机构以及各地合作社的组织，均较去年普遍得多；干部的政策业务水平及其对于收购棉花的实际经验，亦较去年有所提高。以上情况给今年的购棉工作提供了比以前更有利的条件。但由于今年的收购任务十分巨大，执行收购工作不能没有一些新的困难发生。为了防止或克服当前收购棉花工作中可能发生的困难，胜利完成收购任务，我们应当注意那些问题呢？
    第一：收购价格政策问题
    能否正确地掌握棉粮交换的合理比价，贯彻购棉价格政策，是收购棉花工作中的一个基本问题。因为它不仅关系棉农的切身利益，影响着收购任务之能否完成和全国棉纺织工业生产所需原料的供应，而且对今后进一步的增产棉花将起决定性的作用。今年全国棉产所以获得重大成绩不是偶然的；除雨水调匀、播种适时之外，最重要的原因是在于政府采取了正确的价格政策，及时地发布了棉粮合理比价的通告，并规定棉花可以代缴公粮；各大行政区的领导机关亦曾颁布了关于保护棉农利益和奖励植棉的各项办法，并以大量财力、物力与干部帮助农民，消除了个别棉农对于植棉的思想顾虑及解决了农民在植棉中的实际困难。
    过去一年来的收购棉花工作中，全国各地一般的均贯彻了中央关于棉粮合理化价的规定，例如华北区通过华北国营花纱布公司及合作社，在收购去年的棉花工作中，一般的做到了一斤中级皮棉（１４／１６英寸）交换八斤小米的比价，部分地区并有达到十斤左右的，因而切实保障了棉农的利益，对于今年的棉花增产超计划完成是有极重大意义的。但在个别地区，则由于对价格政策重视不够，或因事先对于收购资金及实物力量准备不足，致使农民在出卖棉花之后，无法及时买回其所亟需的东西（如粮食、布匹及其他必需品），或在棉花大量上市之时，未能及时大量收购，致使棉价下跌，引起当地农民不满。今年春间个别地区的部分农民，甚至曾因棉价过低，无人收购，将已植棉苗拔掉改种了其他作物。因此，正确掌握政府所规定的棉粮合理比价，贯彻购棉价格政策，对于做好当前的购棉工作将起决定的作用。
    目前有的地区，因秋粮丰收，粮食上市量增加，曾一度发生粮价下跌，棉价偏高的现象。如华北石家庄、新乡等地，一斤棉花可以换到十二斤乃至十四斤以上的小米；汉口则每斤棉花可换大米十斤以上。而另一些地区，例如河北临清，则因新棉登场较多，各地公私厂商都到该地去采购；由于没有掌握统一的价格，有的收购价格过高（新花当作陈花一样收购），以致形成竞购现象，引起当地市场的一度混乱和粮布价格的上涨。破坏了粮棉比价，结果棉价过高、粮价波动，不但有碍收购棉花任务的顺利完成，同时影响纱布生产成本增高，不仅不利于纺织生产，而且对广大农民也是不利的。因此，这些现象必须引起各地密切注意及早克服，并应采取有效办法避免今后再度发生，坚决贯彻中央人民政府关于收购棉花的价格政策。
    第二：收购组织及其配合问题
    收购棉花工作要有组织地进行。首先国营花纱布公司及其各地的分支公司，应很好与当地合作社结合进行收购，其次，在全国各纺织工业集中的城市，应同时组织公私纱厂进行联购。
    过去一年来，国营花纱布公司所收购的棉花，约占全国公私收购总量的百分之七十以上。这是由于在收购中一般地已与合作社有良好的结合，通过合作社进行购棉（以去年九至十二月华北区为例：合作社代购棉花的数字，即占该区花纱布公司全部购棉额的百分之四十），并广泛地组织社员轧花生产。但在另外某些地方，则因花纱布公司没有与合作社密切结合，他们将国家的购棉款项，有时少给或甚至不给合作社，而多给或全给私商，个别地方的花纱布公司，有时甚至通过私商去掌握合作社；有的则曾滥用私商到处购棉，与当时不少农民卖米购棉的情况挤在一起，致引起棉花市场的一度混乱，其结果是棉价波动，棉质降低。有的甚至因棉价过高，以致花纱布公司只得抛出棉花来平抑物价，而农民又有从公司买到棉花向政府代交公粮的，造成购棉工作中的极不合理的浪费现象，影响收购任务之更好的完成。这些事实证明：在收购棉花工作中，国营花纱布公司与合作社之密切结合，是保证贯彻棉价政策，切实保障棉农利益，胜利完成国家收购计划的主要环节。
    国营花纱布公司与合作社结合购棉过程中对于某些问题的处理，意见不相一致或做法上不够协调的现象，过去曾经有过，今后也仍可能发生；但双方都应采取批评与自我批评的态度，共同商讨处理办法，或各自通过其组织系统，由领导上统一解决。
    国营花纱布公司和合作社结合进行购棉工作，应充分采用合同制度，以便在收花中分清双方应负责任，并便于在统一的计划与领导下通力合作进行购棉。各地花纱布公司与合作社，应依据中央贸易部与全国合作总社所签订的关于购棉的协议，订立各该地区的具体合同；合同一经订定，双方必须严格执行。
    在某些新解放的地区，中国花纱布公司在那里的分支机构尚待建立，合作社在那里的组织又不甚健全或者根本还没有合作社的组织。在此情况下，必要时，花纱布公司也可将其拟购棉花的一部分委托私商进行代购。根据过去的经验，委托私商代购，必须是现款现货，当天清账，且须经常注意检查与监督，以防个别不法商人的投机取巧。中南花纱布公司在去年秋季委托私商代收时，由于部分干部的官僚主义，对于被委托之私商事先并不了解，也不注意检查与监督，结果将大批资金交与私商后，不但未能按期收到棉花，而且所付资金亦未及时收回，直到今年七月，尚欠二千七百余担棉花未能清帐，使国家遭受很大损失。
    除上述国营花纱布公司应与合作社密切结合进行收购外，还必须吸取去年上海的经验，普遍推行公私联购的组织。即在全国各纺织工业集中的城市，应尽可能组织公私营纱厂联合购棉的机构，并在当地贸易行政部门及纺织管理局负责领导下，本统筹兼顾之原则，统一制订购棉计划，筹集资金，按出资比例分配原棉。
    这样有组织有计划地购配原棉，可以防止盲目竞购或原棉供需的不平衡以及棉价涨跌不稳等不良现象之发生，有利于促进城乡物资交流和全国纺织工业的恢复与发展。
    第三：市场的领导与管理问题
    今年购棉数量相当大，棉农在卖出棉花后，需要购买一些生活及生产资料；因之，如果事先没有充分的物资准备来支持购棉市场，不加强市场管理工作，则很可能造成局部地区或个别城市一时的市场混乱和物价波动。最近河北临清，国营花纱布、百货、粮食等专业公司因对市场物资供需情况事先了解估计不足，当农民卖出棉花，大量购买粮食及其他货物时，顿感物资力量准备不足，该市粮食公司将陈麦售罄后，因新麦供应不上而停止挂出牌价，使该市一度发生市场混乱和物价波动。其他如河北武安县，晋南的侯马、运城一带在最近的收花中亦曾发生类此情况。因此，为了在当前大规模的收棉工作中，保持物价的平稳与避免市场混乱，我各地各专业公司必须有充足的物资准备，并须加强对市场的领导与管理。
    首先，国营各专业公司，必须以大量实物来支持这次购棉工作，配合收棉任务出售物资以回笼货币，保持物价的稳定。中央贸易部根据目前全国物价基本稳定与对于各专业公司经营物资以及人民需要等情况的估计，曾于九月一日发出指示，确定各专业公司所经营的商品，须按花纱布公司收花投放货币数量之比例数字，进行实物准备。其中粮食准备，在秋粮未大量上市的月份与在植棉特多（如华北的临清、邯郸等地）以及秋粮歉收（如晋南、关中等地）之重点购棉地区，则必须按照当地需粮程度，酌量提高粮食的比数，以保持棉粮的合理比价，贯彻中央棉价政策。其他各种实物准备，也必须力求切合产棉地区的实际需要。因此，各专业公司在进行实物准备中，必须结合当地农民的具体要求，深入细致的调查研究，具体确定准备实物的品种、数量与质量，以求符合于销路。对于出售价格，必须统一严格规定，以期避免市场混乱与波动。
    其次，应当依照中央贸易部的指示，鼓励各地棉商参加上述公私联合购棉组织，或另自行组织棉商联购；各地贸易行政部门与国营花纱布公司对于参加联购组织的私商，应当切实给予协助。各地参加联购的公私厂商在收购棉花中，均应服从产区贸易行政部门的领导与管理。对于遵守政府政策法令者，政府应给予指导与协助。在某些较大的重点棉花集散市场，则可根据具体情况，联合当地及外来厂商以及联购组织，组成棉花采购委员会，掌握市场价格，避免盲目竞购现象。
    与此同时，必须坚决贯彻共同纲领第三十七条关于商业的规定：“在国家统一的经济计划内实行国内贸易的自由。但对于扰乱市场的投机商业则必须严格取缔。”因此，凡不参加联购组织的正当的私营厂商，都可以自由到产区采购棉花；只要他们服从当地政府有关市场管理的与棉价政策的一切规定，各地政府也应给以便利和指导。只有对于那些不正当的棉商，他们在收购棉花时从事降低质量，哄抬市价，扰乱市场，进行投机及在棉花中掺水使杂等行为，各地政府应当依法予以取缔。
    第四：检验分级问题
    机器棉纺织工业需用之原棉，要有一定的品质与纤维长度，否则就不能纺出一定质量的棉纱。过去，在国民党反动统治时期，我国所产棉花的品质，很多是不适合于机器纺织的要求的；由于缺乏严格、普遍的检验分级工作，以及收花商人的掺水掺杂等不正当行为等原因，使很多棉花粗绒细绒不分，纤维长短不分，各种色泽混作一团，含水含杂量甚为严重，高的有达百分之三、四十者。这不但不利于纺织工业生产，不利于提高我国棉花的品种与质量，而且由于不能生产一定质量的纱布，对于广大消费者亦是不利的。为保证所收棉花适合机器纺织之用，并通过分级、选种以逐渐达到改良我国棉种的目的，各地在收购棉花工作中，必须严格执行对棉花的检验分级和等级差价，贯彻优棉优价政策。
    自去年以来，全国各地国营花纱布公司与当地合作社结合，在收购棉花工作中，一般皆严格执行了检验分级和等级差价，基本上保证了干、白、净、绒长等质量；有的地区并大量自农民手里直接收购籽棉，这不仅减少了中间剥削，且对于提高棉花品质亦起了重大作用，使一年来所收棉花基本上符合于工业生产的要求。但也有部分干部因对此项工作重视不够，认为这是一种“不必要的麻烦”，有的且存在着单纯的恩赐观点，以为这样做对农民不利（？），因此在执行这一工作中，曾表现了不够严肃与认真。掺水使杂现象在某些地区仍是相当普遍存在的。根据中南花纱布公司去年十一月至本年六月份的统计，经过检验的二十七万四千余担棉花中，其含杂量有的竟达百分之十三，含水量最高有达百分之二十。因此，在当前收购棉花工作中，对于检验分级和等级差价问题，仍须引起各地密切注意。
    我国广大农民和部分私商对于这一问题的重要性是认识不清的。这是由于他们在过去长时期中无此习惯，并缺乏这一方面的技术知识和实际经验。因此，在执行检验分级工作中，可能遇到某些阻碍与困难。所以首先，应当通过当地政府结合收购，对棉农与棉商进行广泛的与耐心的宣传解释，使他们懂得：棉花的品质不好，不仅对于城市工业不利，而且对于他们自己也是有害的。对于个别私商人为地在棉花中掺水使杂的不法行为，则应严格取缔。其次，在执行检验分级时，由于干部中存在着检验分级技术水平的不一，可能发生对检验棉花品质的标准不臻一致的现象，亦应尽量避免。最近河北邯郸地区就曾发生过这种情形：该市市内收花干部检验技术水平较高，而该市郊区的收花干部检验技术水平则较低，当农民拿同样的棉花到邯郸市内是以１３／１６英寸皮棉出卖了，而在邯郸郊区则被检验为１４／１６英寸中级皮棉，因而引起了部分棉农的不满。因此，各地收花干部，除必须提高对检验工作的认识外，还应注意加强对检验技术的学习。因为只有这样，我们才能逐步根绝人为的降低棉质的现象，提高棉花的品种与质量，使我国所产棉花完全适合于棉纺织工业的要求。
    目前各地新棉已经陆续大量上市，大规模的收购工作业已开始。依照全国纱锭计算，今年新棉可能收购的数量，大体可以敷用；如依纱布销售情况及人民购买力估计，此数亦可供应全国人民的需要。只要我们在今后的收购工作中，能够注意以上几个问题，我们相信：今年的购棉工作会较过去获得更大的成绩的，因而即可保证全国棉纺织工业的原料供应与全国人民对于棉纺织品的需要，并将给今后进一步的增产棉花创造更有利的条件。
