    Voices Support for Japanese Students in Their Fight for Democratic Rights
   [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 23rd] According to a Teletype News Agency report from Prague on the 20th, the International Student Union recently sent a telegram to the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations, expressing its support for the Japanese students' struggle for democratic rights. In the past few days, 143 students have been arrested, 24 have been injured by the police, and others have been expelled or suspended because Japanese students protested against the authorities' threats to dismiss 600 progressive professors, and some student organizations were forced to disband.
   The International Student Union said in its telegram: On behalf of five million students around the world, we extend our warm greetings to you and support your heroic struggle for democratic rights and better education. Your struggle is an important contribution to the international democratic student movement for peace, national independence, and democratic education. You have lodged strong protests against the authorities' persecution of democratic students and professors. Your work has been well known to the general public. We wish you greater success in your struggle for peace and genuine independence.
   The International Student Union also sent telegrams to the Japanese Prime Minister, Minister of Education, MacArthur, and the President of Waseda University, lodging protests with them.

   【新华社二十三日讯】据电通社布拉格二十日讯：国际学生联合会顷致电全日学生自治会联合会，表示支持日本学生争取民主权利的斗争。在过去数日内，日本学生为了抗议当局威胁要开除六百名进步教授，曾有一百四十三名学生被捕，二十四名被警察打伤，另外还有些被开除和停学，并有若干学生组织被迫解散。
   国际学生联合会在电文中说：我们代表全世界五百万学生，向你们致热烈的敬礼，并支持你们为争取民主权利和更好的教育而从事的英勇斗争。你们的斗争对于争取和平、民族独立和民主教育的国际民主学生运动，是一个很重要的贡献。你们为反对当局迫害民主学生和教授而提出了强硬的抗议。你们的工作已为广大的人群所周知。谨祝你们在争取和平与真正的独立的斗争中获得更大的成功。
   国际学生联合会并致电日本首相、文相、麦克阿瑟及早稻田大学校长，向他们提出抗议。
