Several Opinions on Strengthening Technical Leadership in Agricultural Production and Preventing Plant Diseases and Pests
　　Song Lin
　　The greatest enemy of agricultural production is natural disaster, and among disasters, plant diseases and pests are the most common. Various plant diseases and pests constantly invade and harm various crops, directly hindering agricultural production increase and threatening the lives of the masses. Therefore, strengthening technical guidance and preventing plant diseases and pests has become an urgent task in current agricultural production and should be recognized and valued from the perspective of the mass line and policy. However, some cadres still do not understand technology and can only make general mobilizations and calls. This old leadership method can no longer meet the new demands of the masses. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize the forces of all relevant parties to strengthen technical leadership. Only in this way can we do a good job in the prevention and control of plant diseases and pests and smoothly achieve the restoration and development of production.
    How to strengthen technical leadership and prevent plant diseases and pests?
    First, the principle of "prevention is more important than cure" should be clarified, that is, the work of "prevention" should be strengthened first, which is a fundamental solution. For example, in the autumn and winter seasons, field seed selection (ear selection, grain selection) and seed soaking and mixing before planting wheat should be carried out to ensure that the seeds are of high quality and purity and have the ability to resist diseases; autumn plowing and winter plowing should be carried out universally; burning of withered stubble, digging of insect nests, and removal of weeds should all be done to lay the foundation for the prevention and control of plant diseases and pests next year. This is work that must be seized and carried out conscientiously.
    Second, cadres must first learn technology and go to the countryside with technology. That is to say, leading agricultural production requires not only understanding policies and mastering policies, but also learning technology and mastering technology. The combination of the two can specifically lead agricultural production. Empty slogans of "developing production" and "improving production" without knowing how to improve and develop, or how to eliminate the enemies in development and improvement, will make it impossible to implement and realize policies. At the same time, it is easy to produce two kinds of biases: one is coercion and commandism. Because one does not understand technology, the masses do not approach, but in order to complete the task, one has to force them; the other is laissez-faire, because one does not understand technology, but the masses require technology and one has no resources, so one has to not lead. As some masses reflect: "We already know what you are shouting about, but we don't know what to do, and you can't come up with a solution." The above does not call it coercion and commandism, and what we know is not as much as what the masses know, so we have to let it go, saying "the masses will produce themselves, no leadership is needed." In such two situations, of course, there is no question of going deep into the masses and implementing policies. Therefore, cadres learning technology first becomes an important key to leading agricultural production.
    Who to learn technology from? How to learn?
    1. The leadership should attach importance to technical leadership, give cadres technical lessons, run technical training classes, issue technical manuals, invite technical personnel to explain, and conduct experiments by themselves. 2. Learn from the masses, which is the most important thing. It is wrong to think that farmers are ignorant and cannot talk about technology and to despise their experience. Farmers have many years of production experience, and the masses and practice are the source of technical knowledge. As long as you can delve into it, analyze and study it, it is useful technology.
    Third, science and technology must be combined with farmers' production experience. On the one hand, technical personnel, farms, technology extension stations, plant disease and pest control stations, etc. should be oriented to the countryside, go deep into the farmers, solve the current urgent technical requirements, promote and extend the existing good experience of farmers, and study and create new methods together with farmers. Separating from the masses and separating from reality, being technical for the sake of technology, is bound to fail and is meaningless. On the other hand, various methods must be used to break the conservative, superstitious, and other ideas of farmers in order to smoothly promote science and technology. It is obvious and certain that farmers urgently require technology, but they are often hindered by narrow experience from accepting new methods and science and technology. Therefore, in addition to general publicity and education, we must use some specific methods to make farmers consciously and voluntarily accept science and technology: 1. Conduct on-site experiments among the masses, showing the masses how to soak seeds, mix seeds, and select seeds, and explaining the reasons clearly so that they can also experiment when they return. 2. Organize the masses to compare crops in the fields, comparing the quality of the harvest, and the quality of the seedlings, and use vivid facts to educate farmers to recognize the benefits of paying attention to technology, and then give scientific explanations. 3. Establish small-scale demonstrations, use model workers or activists to conduct demonstrations on a small plot of land in the field, and after success, organize the masses from this village and other villages to visit; and the demonstrators will teach, so the dissemination is very fast. 4. Regularly convene forums for old farmers, and further transform temporary forums into regular technical research conferences. Farms, technology extension stations, etc. should regularly provide guidance, help them research, experiment, and introduce experience, and quickly promote good methods and experience through them. 5. Cultivate technical core figures in villages and mutual aid groups, pay attention to discovering and cultivating technical experts from the masses, praise and reward them, and expand their exemplary role.

　　对加强农业生产的技术领导与防治病虫害的几点意见
    松林
    农业生产上最大的敌人就是自然灾害，而灾害中又以病虫害为最普遍，各种病虫害不断侵袭，为害各种庄稼，直接妨碍着农业增产和威胁群众的生活。因此，加强技术指导，防治病虫害，就成为当前农业生产中的急务，应提高到群众观点与政策观点去认识与重视。但是，现在还有的干部尚不懂技术，只会做一般的动员、号召，这种旧的领导方法已不能适应群众的新的要求，所以必须动员有关各方面的力量，加强技术领导，只有这样，才能做好病虫害防治工作，顺利地达到恢复与发展生产。
    如何加强技术领导防治病虫害呢？
    第一，应明确“防重于治”的方针，即应首先加强“防”的工作，这是治本的办法。如在秋冬之季抓紧进行田间选种（穗选、粒选）和种麦前的浸种、拌种，以保证种籽优纯，有抵抗病害的力量；普遍进行秋耕地、冬耕地；刨烧枯茬，挖掘虫窝，清除杂草等，这都是为明年防除病虫害打下基础。这是必须抓紧认真进行的工作。
    第二，干部必须首先学会技术，带技术下乡。这就是说，领导农业生产不仅要懂得政策，掌握政策，而且要学会技术，掌握技术，二者结合才能具体地领导农业生产。空喊“发展生产”“提高生产”，却不知如何去提高与发展，如何消灭发展与提高中的敌人，那么政策也就无法贯彻与实现。同时，也就容易产生两种偏向：一是强迫命令，因不懂技术，群众不靠近，可是要完成任务，就只好强迫；另一种是放任自流，因为不懂技术，群众却要求技术，没本钱，就只好不去领导。正如有些群众反映：“我们已经知道的事，你们叫喊，我们不会的，你们却拿不出办法。”上面不叫强迫命令，而我们懂得的还不如群众懂得的多，那么就只好放任不管，说“群众自己会生产，不用领导”。像这样两种情形，当然也就谈不到深入群众、贯彻政策了。因此干部自己首先学会技术，就成为领导农业生产的重要关键。
    向谁去学技术？如何去学？
    一、领导上要重视技术领导，给干部上技术课，办技术训练班，印发技术手册，请技术人员进行讲解，自己动手进行试验。二、向群众学，这是最重要的。认为农民愚昧无知，谈不到技术，轻视他们的经验是不对的。农民有多年的生产经验，群众与实际就是技术知识的源泉。只要能深入钻研，分析研究，那就是有用的技术。
    第三、科学技术必须与农民生产经验相结合。一方面，技术人员、农场、技术推广站、病虫防治站等应面向农村，要深入农民，解决当前技术上的迫切要求，把农民已有的好的经验加以提倡推广，并和农民一起研究、创造新办法。脱离群众、脱离实际，为技术而技术，是必然会失败的，是无意义的。另一方面，要用各种方法，打破农民的保守、迷信等思想，才能顺利推行科学技术。农民迫切要求技术这是明显而肯定的，但往往又容易被狭隘经验阻碍他们接受新办法与科学技术。所以，我们除要做一般的宣传教育外，要用一些具体办法使农民自觉自愿地接受科学技术：一、在群众中进行当场试验，把如何浸种、拌种、选种，做给群众看，并讲清道理，让他们回去也试验。二、组织群众到地里比庄稼，比收成好坏，比禾苗优劣，用活的事实教育农民认识讲究技术的好处，再加以科学讲解。三、创办小型示范，运用劳动模范或积极分子，在地头用一小块地进行示范，成功后组织本村与外村的群众参观、访问；由示范者进行讲授，这样传播很快。四、经常召集老农座谈会，并进一步把临时的座谈会变为经常的技术研究会，农场、技术推广站等应经常进行指导，帮助他们研究会、试验，和介绍经验，把好的方法与经验通过他们迅速地推广。五、培养村的、互助组的技术核心人物，注意从群众中发现与培养技术专家，加以表扬奖励，扩大他们的模范作用。
