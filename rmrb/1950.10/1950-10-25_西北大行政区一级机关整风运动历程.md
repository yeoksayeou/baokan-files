The rectification movement in the first-level organs of the Northwest Administrative Region was carried out in three stages: the first stage was to expose problems, the second stage was to solve problems, and the third stage was to summarize the rectification. The second stage was the main stage of the rectification, the first stage was preparation for the second stage, and the third stage was the conclusion of the rectification. In these three stages, there are some issues that can be drawn as experiences and lessons.

The first stage of the rectification movement should adopt various effective measures to fully mobilize and unify ideological understanding.

To make the rectification movement in-depth, it is impossible without the active participation of the broad masses of cadres. The first stage is to mobilize the masses to fully expose the shortcomings and errors in our work (expose problems) to lay the foundation for inspecting and improving work (solving problems) in the second stage. To complete this task, in addition to carefully reading certain designated documents, the most important thing is how to eliminate everyone's ideological concerns and correct the attitude of rectification. If this aspect is not done well, the rectification will not be in-depth, and deviations may occur.

The situation at that time was: the general cadres welcomed the rectification and dared to criticize the work and the leadership. However, there were also many concerns, the most common of which was: some comrades believed that "suggestions are useless," and adopted a passive attitude towards rectification; among some new cadres, they were afraid of causing trouble by making suggestions, and adopted a wait-and-see attitude. In addition, a small number of new comrades, because they had been affected by the reactionary propaganda of the Kuomintang reactionaries against the rectification in the liberated areas in the past, had doubts about the rectification.

Based on this situation, all organs conducted relatively in-depth mobilization at the beginning of the rectification. Some held mobilization meetings repeatedly, conveying and explaining the significance of the rectification, chatting and discussing the understanding of the rectification, and at the same time emphasizing the study of documents and understanding the spirit of the rectification. In response to some relatively common and prominent concerns, timely and specific negative work was done: in response to the idea that "suggestions are useless," some organs consciously and timely solved some problems that could be solved, and timely explained the reasons for those that could not be solved; some organs, in response to the fear of causing trouble, focused on discussing the significance of criticism and self-criticism; leading comrades also sincerely expressed their attitude, guaranteeing that they would never retaliate, and called on everyone to make more suggestions. In this way, general concerns were eliminated, understanding was unified, and everyone was organized ideologically. In this way, the problems in the work were exposed more comprehensively and in-depth. This is the key to the correct and in-depth conduct of the rectification movement.

The purpose of exposing problems is to solve them. The purpose of solving problems is to improve cadres and improve work. This is also the purpose of rectification.

Solving general ideological and work style problems through checking specific work is the most effective; starting from concepts or solving problems in isolation is bound to fail.

Among the large number of problems exposed, it is impossible to solve them one by one, but to focus on solving the most important problems, that is, the problems that exist in implementing the party's basic policies and performing major work tasks. Other secondary problems can be solved incidentally. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and summarize according to the exposed problems and find out the focus of the solution. In this regard, general organs at that time were serious about doing it. However, some organs lacked effective methods after finding the focus. Several situations occurred here:

One is to solve problems starting from concepts. That is, based on some fragmented phenomena, simply put on a few hats of "bureaucratism" and "empiricism," and emptyly discuss its ideological roots, manifestations, and methods of correction. Because of the lack of practical content, it can only enable everyone to understand these "isms" from concepts, but not from specific events. In this way, the understanding of shortcomings and errors will not be profound, and therefore the improvement of current practical work will not be of great use.

The other is to check one work in isolation, solve the problems in one work, or only solve one problem. In this way, it will inevitably pay excessive attention to details, pursue responsibility, so that everyone only knows the specific errors and shortcomings in the work, and cannot raise it to the height of general principles, cannot draw inferences about other cases from one instance, and cannot solve general basic problems. Therefore, it cannot avoid the recurrence of errors of the same nature.

The results of these two methods are failures.

Experience proves that the most effective way to solve problems is: to start from checking specific work and solve problems in general ideology, work style, organization system, etc. That is, according to the focus of solving problems, conduct in-depth and specific inspections on one or several major tasks, distinguish between achievements and shortcomings, right and wrong, and further conduct a comprehensive and specific analysis of the causes of shortcomings and errors, which will inevitably involve problems in all aspects such as principles and tasks, policy implementation, ideological work style, work methods, and work systems. In this whole process of inspection and analysis, affirm the right and criticize the wrong; promote the right and correct the wrong; it will naturally improve everyone's ideological and political level, thereby changing the work style (including the leadership style). At the same time, it will also be able to formulate specific and feasible methods for improving work based on the results of inspection and analysis, combined with the current situation. Wherever this method of checking specific work and solving general problems is adopted, the problems are solved more deeply, and the rectification has significant achievements.

This is one of the main experiences in the rectification of first-level organs in the Northwest Administrative Region.

In general, in this stage, general organs can basically grasp the direction of checking work and solving problems, so that the main problems existing in various organs have been largely (to varying degrees) resolved.

The third stage of rectification should make personal ideological summaries to consolidate the results of rectification. This stage has an indispensable role in consolidating the achievements of rectification and further improving the ideology of cadres. In addition to summarizing the experience of rectification, personal ideological summary is very important here. That is, all cadres participating in the rectification should, under the principle of voluntariness, check their personal thoughts according to the spirit of rectification. Communist Party members should also check themselves according to the Party Constitution. (Editor's note: All party member cadres participating in the rectification should conduct personal ideological and work style checks based on the standards of the Party Constitution on the basis of checking and summarizing work; non-party cadres should conduct checks under the principle of voluntariness.) This will make the spirit of rectification concretely implemented on everyone, and make everyone's thoughts systematically improved. This is one of the steps to complete the rectification. Some organs have not carried out this step seriously or have not carried it out at all, which is undoubtedly a loss.

It has been proven throughout the entire rectification that studying documents has a clear effect on both exposing and solving problems. In the concluding stage of the rectification, combining personal ideological summaries with the study of certain documents has a more direct effect. This is one aspect. On the other hand, it has been proven in the inspection work that general cadres in the rectification have realized that their theoretical, policy, and professional levels are not enough to keep up with the needs of the work, and they generally require learning. Therefore, at the end of the rectification, it is entirely necessary to study certain specific documents or several relevant business policies in a timely manner in response to the specific needs of cadres and in connection with current work tasks. Some organs have done this, and everyone's enthusiasm for learning is very high, feeling that they have improved a step on the basis of rectification and have clear gains.

Overcoming bureaucratism in the leadership of the rectification is an important key to the correct and in-depth development of the rectification movement.

The entire rectification process proves that the leadership issue is a key issue.

In general, the leading comrades of the first-level organs of the Northwest Administrative Region attached importance to the rectification: they personally conducted publicity and mobilization, promoted democracy, eliminated concerns, participated in the leadership of the study committee, studied the problems in the rectification at any time, and some even participated in the rectification and study in an exemplary manner, truly achieving the responsibility of the chief and personally taking action. This played a great role in the correct and in-depth development of the rectification movement.

However, in some organs, the leadership had weaknesses. This weakness directly caused losses to the rectification. This is the slack and weak leadership, laissez-faire:

1. The criticism and self-criticism of the leadership have not been well developed, they do not seriously review themselves, do not criticize each other much, and wait for the lower levels to make suggestions. They do not humbly consider and effectively solve the opinions of the lower levels, but adopt an attitude of listening and ignoring them. There are also cases where leading comrades are pushed by the lower levels.

2. They still lack a serious and responsible attitude towards the rectification. They have not effectively understood the spirit of the rectification, and have not conducted serious research on the specific situation of the department and the existing problems. Therefore, the direction of the rectification is not clear, deviations occur and cannot be corrected in time, and the result is that they are clueless and blindly rectify.

3. Using the excuse of being busy with work, they abandon the leadership of the rectification and cannot closely coordinate the rectification with daily leadership work.

Therefore, it can be said that: to make the rectification correct and in-depth, the first thing is to strengthen leadership. Leading comrades must first attach importance to the rectification, seriously study the party's calls and the instructions of higher authorities, seriously study the specific situation of the department and the existing problems, and how to solve these problems, and overcome the bureaucratic attitude in leading the rectification. More importantly: leading comrades must fully grasp the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, take the lead in enlightening and creating an atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism, and improve the democratic style.

　　西北大行政区一级机关整风运动历程
    也辛
    西北大行政区一级机关的整风运动，是分三个阶段进行的：第一阶段是暴露问题，第二阶段是解决问题，第三阶段是整风总结。其中第二阶段是整风的主要阶段，第一阶段是第二阶段的准备，第三阶段是整风的结束。在这三个阶段中，都有一些可以引为经验教训的问题。
    整风第一阶段要采取各种有效措施充分进行动员，统一思想认识
    要使整风运动深入进行，没有广大干部群众的积极参加是不可能的。第一阶段就是要发动群众，充分揭发我们工作中的缺点和错误（暴露问题）为第二阶段检查工作，改进工作（解决问题）打下基础。要完成这一任务，除了认真阅读某些指定的文件外，最重要的就是如何消除大家的思想顾虑，端正整风态度。这方面如果作不好，整风就不可能深入，就可能发生偏向。
    当时的情况是：一般干部对整风是欢迎的，并且敢于对工作、对领导提出批评。但也有不少顾虑，其中最普遍的是：有些同志认为“提了意见不顶事”，对整风采取一种消极的态度；在一部分新干部中间，怕提了意见惹是非，采取一种观望的态度。另有少数新同志，因为过去受过国民党反动派对解放区整风的反动宣传的影响，对整风存有疑惧。
    根据这一情况，各机关在整风开始都进行了比较深入的动员。有些曾三番五次的开动员会，传达、解释整风的意义，漫谈、讨论对整风的认识，同时强调学习文件，领会整风的精神。对一些比较普遍、突出的顾虑，及时的作了具体的消极工作：针对“提了意见不顶事”的想法，有些机关就有意识的及时解决一些可能解决的问题，不能解决的也及时的说明理由；有些机关针对怕惹是非的思想，着重讨论了批评与自我批评的意义；领导同志并诚恳的表明态度，保证绝不报复，号召大家多提意见。这样，一般顾虑都消除了，统一了认识，把大家从思想上组织起来。这样就比较全面、深入的暴露了工作中的问题。这是整风运动正确、深入进行的关键。
    暴露问题的目的，是要解决它。解决问题的目的，是要提高干部，改进工作。这也就是整风的目的。
  通过检查具体工作，解决一般思想作风问题，最有成效；从概念出发，或孤立解决问题，必然失败
    在暴露的大量问题中，不可能一一予以解决，而是要着重解决最主要的问题，即在贯彻党的基本政策、执行主要工作任务中所存在的问题。其他次要问题可以附带解决。因此，就要根据暴露的问题，分析归纳，找出解决的重点。这一方面，当时一般机关都是认真作了的。但重点找出后如何解决，有些机关却缺少有效的方法。这里曾发生几种情况：
    一种是从概念出发解决问题。就是根据一些零碎现象，简单的戴上几个“官僚主义”、“经验主义”的帽子，空洞的讨论它的思想根源，表现形态，以及改正的方法等。因为缺乏实际的内容，就只能使大家从概念上去了解这些“主义”，而不能从具体事件上去认识它。这样对缺点错误的认识就不会深刻，因而对当前实际工作的改进就作用不大。
    另一种是孤立的检查一项工作，解决一项工作中的问题，或只解决某一个问题。这样就必然会过分的注意细节，追究责任，使大家只知道工作中的具体的错误和缺点，提不到一般原则的高度，不能触类旁通、解决一般的基本的问题。因而就不能避免同一性质错误的重犯。
    这两种方法，进行结果都是失败的。
    经验证明：解决问题最有效的方法是：从检查具体工作入手，来解决一般的思想、作风、组织制度等各方面的问题。这就是根据解决问题的重点，就一项或几项主要工作，进行深入具体的检查，分清成绩和缺点，正确的和错误的，进一步对缺点错误产生的原因，进行全面、具体的分析，这就必然涉及到方针任务、政策执行、思想作风、工作方法、工作制度等各个方面存在的问题。在这整个的检查、分析过程中，肯定对的，批判错的；对的发扬，错的改正，就自然会提高大家的思想水平和政治水平，从而转变工作作风（包括领导作风）。同时也就能够根据检查和分析的结果，结合当前情况，订出切实可行的改进工作的具体办法。凡是采用了这种检查具体工作，解决一般问题的方法，问题解决得就比较深入，整风就有显著的成绩。
    这是西北大行政区一级机关整风中的主要经验之一。
    总的说，这一阶段中，一般机关基本上都能掌握检查工作、解决问题这一方向，使各机关存在的主要问题，得到了大体上的（程度不等）解决。
    整风第三阶段应作出个人思想总结，巩固整风成果第三阶段是整风的结束阶段。此一阶段对巩固整风成绩。并进一步提高干部思想，具有不可忽视的作用。这里除了总结整风的经验外，个人思想总结是很重要的。这就是所有参加整风的干部，要在自愿的原则下，根据整风的精神，检查个人的思想。共产党员并要根据党章来检查自己。（编者按：所有参加整风的党员干部，一律应在检查总结工作的基础上，以党章的标准，进行个人思想作风的检查；非党干部则应在自愿原则下进行检查。）这样就使整风的精神具体的贯彻到每个人身上，使每个人的思想都能得到系统的提高。这是完成整风的步骤之一。有些机关没有认真进行或根本没有进行这一步骤，无疑地是一种损失。
    在整个整风中证明：学习文件无论对暴露问题、解决问题、都有明显的作用。而在整风的结束阶段中，结合个人的思想总结，学习某些文件，就更有直接的效果。这是一方面。另一方面，在检查工作中证明：整风中一般干部都发觉自己的理论、政策、业务水平不够，赶不上工作需要，普遍要求学习。因此，在整风结束的时候，针对干部的具体需要，结合当前工作任务，及时的学习某些特定的文件，或某几项有关业务的政策，是完全必要的。有些机关这样作了，大家学习热情很高，感觉到在整风基础上提高了一步，有明确收获。
    克服整风领导中的官僚主义，是整风运动正确深入开展的重要关键。
    整个整风过程证明：领导问题是个关键问题。
    西北大行政区一级机关，一般的说，领导同志对整风是重视的：亲自进行传达动员，发扬民主，消除顾虑，参加学委会的领导，随时研究整风中的问题，有的并模范的参加整风学习，真正作到了首长负责，亲自动手。这对整风运动的正确、深入展开，起了很大的作用。
    但在某些机关中，领导是有弱点的。这一弱点直接使整风受到损失。这就是领导的松懈无力，放任自流：
    一、领导上的批评与自我批评没有很好的展开，自己不认真检讨，互相间不多批评，等着下边提意见。对下边的意见不是虚心考虑，切实解决，而是采取一种听完算数、置之不理的态度。领导同志被下边推着走的情况也是有的。
    二、对整风还缺乏认真负责的严肃态度。对整风的精神没有切实的领会，对本部门的具体情况及存在的问题不作认真的研究，因此，整风方向不明确，发生偏向而不能及时纠正，结果是心中无数，盲目整风。
    三、借口工作忙，放弃整风领导，不能使整风和日常领导工作密切配合起来。
    因此可以说：要使整风正确、深入的进行，首先就是要加强领导。领导同志首先要重视整风，认真研究党的号召和上级的指示，认真研究本部门的具体情况和存在的问题，以及如何解决这些问题，克服领导整风中的官僚主义态度。更重要的是：领导同志一定要充分掌握批评与自我批评的武器，带头启发，造成批评与自我批评的空气，健全民主作风。
