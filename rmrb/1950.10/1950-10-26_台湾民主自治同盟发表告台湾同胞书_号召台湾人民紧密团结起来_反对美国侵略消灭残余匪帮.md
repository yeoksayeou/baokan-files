Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 25th: The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League issued a "Letter to Taiwan Compatriots" on October 25th, calling on the people of Taiwan to unite, oppose American aggressors, and eliminate the remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Compatriots: Five years ago, thanks to the victory of the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan, the people of Taiwan achieved their long-cherished wish of fifty years – to get rid of the slave life under foreign rule and return to the embrace of the motherland. We, the people of Taiwan, fought and cheered for this. We warmly welcomed the compatriots and troops from the mainland, eagerly hoping to

Under the support of the Chiang bandit gang, the US imperialist conspiracy to invade Taiwan has turned into open action. We know that the US imperialist conspiracy to invade Taiwan began as early as the first day the Chiang bandit gang "took over" Taiwan. For five years, the US imperialists, on the one hand, colluded with the traitor Chiang bandit gang to gradually control Taiwan, and on the other hand, instigated Taiwanese traitors to plot "trusteeship" and "independence," attempting to directly occupy it and make Taiwan a US imperialist colony, a base for aggression against China and Asia, and enslave the Taiwanese people to serve as cannon fodder for their aggressive wars. On June 27th, after the US imperialists issued a public declaration of aggression, its Seventh Fleet has been permanently stationed in Taiwan, and the US 13th Air Force has also established a base in Taiwan. On October 7th, disregarding our repeated protests and the opposition of representatives from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other countries, it manipulated its majority voting machine at the Fifth UN General Assembly and unreasonably decided to include the so-called "Formosa issue" on the agenda of the General Assembly, attempting to create a legal basis for its invasion of Taiwan.

Compatriots! The reason why the US imperialists are so crazy and unreasonable, and why the Chiang bandit gang is so shameless and despicable, is simply that they are unwilling to fail in the face of the glorious victory of the Chinese people and want to make a desperate struggle. Although their desperate struggle has increased some difficulties for the Chinese people, it can never hinder the victorious advance of the Chinese people. Our motherland is no longer the motherland under the rule of the Chiang bandit gang. The young but strong People's Republic of China has been established for a year. Today, the first true unity of the Chinese people has emerged on the land of the motherland, and the people have become the masters of the motherland. Under the united struggle of 470 million people, our motherland is advancing and growing vigorously. We have overcome the disasters left by the long-term sabotage of imperialism and the Chiang bandit gang, defeated the encirclement and bombing of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, reversed the extreme chaos of inflation and financial economy for more than ten years, achieved the initial improvement of the financial and economic situation, and will gradually carry out land reform in the newly liberated areas with a population of 300 million, so that poor peasants can obtain the land they need. Our motherland is like the rising sun, shining brightly, with infinitely bright prospects. We firmly believe that all the conspiracies and all the atrocities of the US imperialists and the Chiang bandit gang will never hinder the liberation of Taiwan by the Chinese people.

Since returning to the embrace of the motherland, the people of Taiwan have participated in the Chinese people's liberation struggle against imperialism and the Chiang bandit gang, and the people of Taiwan have used their blood to carry out this glorious task. February 28, 1947, is a day that the people of Taiwan will never forget. The armed uprising of the people of Taiwan once shook the enemy's heart and courage and severely hit the rule of the reactionaries. The people of Taiwan must inherit the brave and fearless fighting spirit of "February 28" and wage a resolute and unremitting struggle against the foreign robbers, the US imperialists, and the traitor Chiang bandit gang.

Today, the struggle of the people of Taiwan is by no means isolated. We not only have the strong people of the motherland and the heroic People's Liberation Army, but also the support of the peace-loving and democratic people of the world. Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. This is not only a historical fact, but also determined by the Cairo Declaration of 1943 and the Potsdam Declaration of 1945, and further affirmed by the status quo after Japan's surrender. This ironclad fact does not allow any robbers to distort or change it. The Chinese people, who have defeated Japanese imperialism, driven out the US imperialists from the mainland, and eliminated the Chiang bandit gang, will never allow any imperialist aggression. The People's Liberation Army is determined to liberate Taiwan from the hands of any reactionaries and imperialists. Premier Zhou Enlai said at the celebration of the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China: "People can see that in the operation to liberate Taiwan, our strategic position is far superior to any enemy. We stand on the side of sacred justice, our rear is so close, so large, so consolidated, and we are doubling our efforts to achieve this final victory." Taiwan must be liberated, this is completely certain. Taiwan will always be Chinese territory, and the people of Taiwan will always live in the big family of the Chinese nation.

Today, when the people of the whole country are doubling their efforts to prepare for the liberation of Taiwan, the glorious task of the people of Taiwan is to unite closely, use all their strength, in any corner, in any position, use all kinds of ways to oppose any anti-people crimes of the Chiang bandit gang, oppose the armed intervention of the US imperialists and conspiracies such as "independence" and "trusteeship," create favorable conditions for the liberation of Taiwan, and strive to welcome the coming glorious victory.

Pay tribute to the patriotic Taiwanese compatriots who continue to wage a resolute struggle against domestic and foreign reactionaries in Taiwan!
Taiwanese people unite and oppose American aggressors!
Taiwanese people unite and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang!
Long live the liberation of the Taiwanese people!
Long live the People's Republic of China!

    台湾民主自治同盟发表告台湾同胞书
    号召台湾人民紧密团结起来  反对美国侵略消灭残余匪帮
    【新华社上海二十五日电】台湾民主自治同盟于十月二十五日发表“告台湾同胞书”，号召台湾人民团结起来，反对美国侵略者，消灭蒋介石残余匪帮。该书原文如下：亲爱的同胞们：五年前，由于祖国人民抗日战争的胜利，台湾人民达到了五十年来的宿愿——摆脱异族统治的奴隶生活，而重归祖国的怀抱。我们台湾人民曾为此奋斗欢呼。我们热烈地迎接了从大陆来的同胞及军队，热望与祖
    在蒋匪帮的支持之下美帝侵略台湾的阴谋，已经变为公然的行动。我们知道，美帝侵略台湾的阴谋是早从蒋匪帮“接收”台湾的第一天就开始了。五年来，美帝一面勾结卖国贼蒋匪帮逐步控制台湾，一面唆使台奸阴谋“托管”、“独立”，企图直接占领，使台湾成为美帝的殖民地，侵略中国，侵略亚洲的基地，奴役台湾人民充当其侵略战争的炮灰。六月二十七日，美帝发表公开侵略声明后，它的第七舰队已经常驻扎在台湾，美国第十三航空队也已在台湾建立了基地。十月七日更不顾我国屡次的抗议和苏联及捷克等国代表的反对，竟在联合国第五届大会上操纵他多数投票的机器，无理决定将所谓“福摩萨问题”列入联大的议程，妄图为其侵略台湾造成法律上的根据。
    同胞们！美帝之所以如此疯狂无理，蒋匪帮之所以如此无耻、卑鄙，只不过是他们在中国人民的辉煌胜利面前，不甘心失败，想作垂死的挣扎而已。他们的拚死挣扎，虽然增加了中国人民的若干困难，但决不能阻挠中国人民的胜利前进。我们的祖国已经不是蒋匪帮统治下的祖国。年青的、但是壮大的中华人民共和国建立已经一年了。今天，在祖国的大地上，出现了中国人民第一次真正的统一，人民已成了祖国的主人。我们祖国在四万七千万人民的团结奋斗之下，正在朝气蓬勃地前进与壮大中。我们克服了帝国主义和蒋匪帮长期破坏所留下的灾荒，战胜了帝国主义及国民党反动派的包围、轰炸，扭转了十多年来的通货膨胀、财政经济的极端混乱状况，获得了财政经济状况的开始好转，并将逐步地在三万万人口的新解放区进行土地改革，使贫苦的农民获得他所需要的土地。我们的祖国正如旭日方升，光芒万丈，前途无限光明。我们坚信美帝与蒋匪帮的一切阴谋、一切暴行，决阻挠不了中国人民的解放台湾。
    台湾人民自从回到祖国怀抱的第一天起，就参加了中国人民反对帝国主义、反对蒋匪帮的解放斗争，台湾人民曾经用自己的鲜血来执行这个光荣的任务。一九四七年二月二十八日是台湾人民永不会忘记的一天，台湾人民的武装起义，曾经震动了敌人的心胆，沉重地打击了反动派的统治。台湾人民一定要继承“二、二八”勇敢无畏的奋斗精神，与外国强盗美帝及卖国贼蒋匪帮作坚决不懈的斗争。
    今天，台湾人民的斗争决不是孤立无援的。我们不但有强大的祖国人民和英雄无比的人民解放军，而且还有全世界和平民主人民的支持。台湾是中国不可分割的一部分，这不仅是历史的事实，而且也为一九四三年的开罗宣言及一九四五年的波茨坦宣言所确定，更为日本投降后的现状所肯定。这铁一般的事实是不容许任何强盗们加以歪曲及改变的。已经战胜了日本帝国主义、又从大陆上驱逐美帝及消灭了蒋匪帮的中国人民，决不能容许任何帝国主义的侵略。人民解放军已决心从任何反动派和帝国主义的手中来解放台湾。周恩来总理在庆祝中华人民共和国成立一周年时说：“人们可以看出，在解放台湾的作战中，我们的战略地位是比任何敌人要优越得多。我们是站在神圣的正义方面，我们的后方是这样近，这样大，这样巩固，我们正为取得这个最后胜利而在加倍努力。”台湾必定要解放，这是完全肯定了的。台湾永远是中国的领土，台湾人民将永远生活在中华民族的大家庭中。
    今天当全国人民正为解放台湾而加倍努力准备的时候，台湾人民的光荣任务，是紧密地团结起来，以一切力量，在任何一个角落，在任何一个岗位，利用各种各样的方式，来反对蒋匪帮的任何反人民罪行，反对美帝的武装干涉以及什么“独立”、“托管”等阴谋，为解放台湾创造有利条件，为迎接行将到来的光荣胜利而奋斗。
    向在台湾继续与国内外反动派做坚决斗争的爱国台胞致敬！
    台湾人民团结起来，反对美国侵略者！
    台湾人民团结起来，消灭蒋介石残余匪帮！
    台湾人民解放万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
                                            台湾民主自治同盟
                                        一九五○年十月二十五日
