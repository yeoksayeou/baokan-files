　　Hebei Supply and Marketing Cooperative Meets the Needs of Members and Cotton Farmers
    Prepares Large Quantities of Goods to Exchange for Cotton
    [This Dispatch] This year, the cotton planting area in Hebei Province has expanded and the cotton harvest is relatively good. The ginned cotton harvested by cooperative members throughout the province is estimated to be about 25 million jin. Ordinary members and the vast number of cotton farmers urgently need to sell new cotton to purchase fertilizer, livestock, grain, daily necessities, and agricultural tools. In order to meet the needs of members and cooperate with the state-owned trading authorities' cotton purchasing work, the Hebei Supply and Marketing Cooperative has decided to purchase 4 million jin of ginned cotton in the fourth quarter, and will give priority to purchasing cotton from members, in order to implement the principle of serving members. Among them, 2 million jin will be exchanged for 14 million jin of bean cake, 20 million jin of coarse grains, 6,000 bolts of coarse cloth, and 70,000 jin of arsenic; another 2 million jin will be purchased with cash. The cooperative has signed a temporary purchase contract with the state-owned company, and will obey the company's leadership in controlling prices.

　　河北供销总社满足社员与棉农需要
    准备大批实物换购棉花
    【本报讯】河北省今年植棉面积扩大，棉花收成较好。全省合作社社员收获的皮棉，估计约有二千五百万斤。一般社员及广大棉农急待出卖新棉，购进肥料、牲畜、粮食、日用品和农具。河北供销总社为了满足社员要求，配合国营贸易机关的购棉工作，决定在第四季收购皮棉四百万斤，并尽先收购社员棉花，以贯彻为社员服务方针。其中二百万斤准备以豆饼一千四百万斤、粗粮二千万斤、大布六千匹、信石七万斤换购；另以现款购进二百万斤。该社已与国营公司订立暂时代购合同，在价格掌握上服从公司领导。
