Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, acting upon Chairman Mao's instructions to fundamentally control the Huai River and under the personal guidance of Premier Zhou of the Government Administration Council, convened a Huai River management conference from August 25th to September 12th. The conference decided to adopt a policy of combining water storage and drainage for managing the Huai River, setting the long-term goal of water storage and water conservancy development in the upper reaches, a combination of storage and drainage in the middle reaches, and the opening of a waterway to the sea in the lower reaches. Based on this decision, the conference formulated the steps for the Huai River management project, deciding to focus on surveying work before December this year, with emphasis on surveying water storage projects in the upper reaches and the waterway to the sea in the lower reaches. At the same time, surveying work will also be carried out for widening the distance between embankments, dredging, culverts, and sluice gates. In the middle reaches, parts of the project that have a smaller relationship with the upper and lower reaches will be selected within the overall plan and will start construction in late October, combined with work relief programs. The conference also decided to strive to complete the earthwork and piling work for the culvert and sluice gate projects of the entire Huai River by next spring and to prepare all materials for Huai River management, with full-scale construction starting after February next year.

To ensure the smooth progress of the Huai River management work, the conference also suggested that the relevant regions of East China and Central South, based on the existing Huai River Water Conservancy Engineering General Bureau, form a Huai River Management Committee to uniformly lead the Huai River management work, and establish three engineering bureaus for the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Huai River to take overall consideration into account.

More than 40 people, including the heads and experts of the East China Water Conservancy Department, the Central South Water Conservancy Department, the Northern Anhui Administrative Office, the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office, the Henan Provincial People's Government, the Huai River Water Conservancy Engineering General Bureau, and the Henan Yellow River Flood Area Rehabilitation Bureau, participated in this Huai River management conference.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th: To fundamentally control the Huai River water disaster, the Huai River Estuary Reconnaissance Team departed from Yangzhou on October 1st to begin reconnaissance work. The team is led by Wang Huzhen, Deputy Minister of the Water Conservancy Department of the East China Military and Political Committee, and Liu Zhongrui, Director of the Engineering Department of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, including more than 40 people from nine relevant units, as well as water conservancy experts Sun Fushi, Xu Xinwu, geography expert Hu Huanyong, and soil expert Zhu Weixin. Before the team departed, it held a meeting in the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office to discuss the reconnaissance route and content. The reconnaissance team is divided into rural and engineering groups to conduct investigations and research work, which is expected to be completed by the end of October. After the reconnaissance work is completed, the river line, estuary, and engineering plan will be planned based on the reconnaissance data.

　　水利部召开治淮会议
    决定今冬以勘测为重心明春全部动工
    淮河入海水道查勘团已由扬州出发
    【新华社十五日讯】中央人民政府水利部根据毛主席根治淮河的指示和政务院周总理亲自指导下，曾于八月二十五日至九月十二日召开治淮会议。会议决定以蓄泄兼筹为治淮的方针，并确定淮河上游以蓄洪发展水利为长远目标，中游蓄泄并重，下游则开辟入海水道。会议根据此一决定，制定了治淮工程的步骤，决定今年十二月以前以勘测工作为重心，上游和下游以查勘蓄洪工程和入海水道为重点，同时并进行放宽堤距、疏浚、涵闸等勘测工作，中游地区在整个计划内，选择对上、下游关系较小的部分工程结合以工代赈于十月下旬先行开工。会议并决定争取明年春完成整个淮河的涵闸工程土工和打桩工作，并备齐一切治淮材料，于明年二月以后即全部动工。
    为保证治淮工作的顺利进行，会议并建议由华东、中南各有关地区在现有淮河水利工程总局的基础之上，组成治淮委员会，统一领导治淮工作，并成立淮河上、中、下游的三个工程局，以便统筹兼顾。
    参加此次治淮会议的有华东水利部、中南水利部、皖北行署、苏北行署及河南省人民政府、淮河水利工程总局及河南黄泛区复兴局等负责人及专家四十余人。
    【新华社上海十五日电】为根治淮河水患，淮河入海水道查勘团已于十月一日从扬州出发开始进行勘查工作。该团由华东军政委员会水利部副部长汪胡桢及中央人民政府水利部工务司司长刘钟瑞领导，包括有关的九个单位共四十余人，并有水利专家孙辅世、许心武、地理专家胡焕庸、土壤专家朱维新等参加。该团出发前曾在苏北行署开会讨论了查勘路线与内容。查勘团分农村、工程两个组进行调查研究工作，预计于十月底完成。勘查工作完成后，即根据查勘资料，规划河线、入海口及工程方案。
