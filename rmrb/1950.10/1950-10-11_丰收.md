　　Harvest
    Xiang Shi
    Burning hot days!
    We celebrate the harvest!
　  For thousands of years,
    The harvest did not belong to the people.
    "The family has ten thousand stones of grain!"
    Only "Master" said it this way.
    Under the great banner of Chairman Mao—
    Ten thousand miles of fertile land belong to the masters;
    Under the sunlight of Chairman Mao
    Man-high millet "overflows with gold,"
    Smiling cotton bolls shine like flowers!
    Thousands of congratulatory messages report to Beijing,
    Each one says:
    "Your kindness is immeasurable!"
    "This year's harvest is better than last year's,
    Next year's situation will be better than this year's!"
    Wanli Village in Lingchuan,
    The message is passed:
    "Careful planning leads to prosperity,
    Determined to learn from Li Shunda.
    Poverty transforms to wealth,
    In just a year and a half!"
          Five days after the 1950 National Day

　　丰收
    向实
    火热的日子！
    我们贺丰收！
　  几千年，
    丰收不是人民的。
    “家有万石粮！”
    只听“老爷”这般说。
    在毛主席的大旗下——
    万里良田归了主；
    在毛主席的阳光下
    人高的谷子“金满斗”，
    笑开的棉朵耀眼花！
    千封喜报报北京，
    封封都说：
    “你的恩情数不清！”
    “今年年成比去年好，
    明年光景会比今年强！”
    陵川万里村，
    口讯传过来：
    “精打细算闹发家，
    决心学习李顺达。
    穷万变富万，
    只要一年半！”
          一九五○年国庆节后五天
