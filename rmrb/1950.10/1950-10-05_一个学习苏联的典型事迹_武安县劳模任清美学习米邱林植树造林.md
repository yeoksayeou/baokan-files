　　A Typical Example of Learning from the Soviet Union
    Wu'an County Model Worker Ren Qingmei Studies Michurin's Tree Planting and Afforestation
    In February of this year, the All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association's film mobile screening team came to Wu'an County, Hebei Province, and screened the film "Michurin." A few days later, the screening team left, but the story of "Michurin" left a huge impact there, and a typical example of learning from the Soviet Union occurred.
    Ren Qingmei, a member of the Wu'an County Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branch and a model worker in the county, thought of the uneven soil, the mixed planting of trees, and the poor quality of apples in his village when he saw the Soviet film "Michurin." He thought it might be due to the unsuitable soil and varieties as pointed out in the "Michurin" film. Therefore, he decided to learn from Michurin to transform the trees in his village. Initially, Ren Qingmei collected more than 200 young branches of excellent apple trees from 20 miles away, sealed and stored them in hollowed-out sweet potatoes to prevent them from drying out, and brought them back. The experiment of grafting them proved successful. Then, he planned how to adapt to the different soils in his village, planting new varieties of apple trees in the white sandy soil, planting willows on the sandy beaches, and planting walnuts in the mountain gullies, while planting miscellaneous trees on the mountain slopes to prevent wind, thus turning the river beach of his village into a forest and the mountain slopes into orchards. His village would also increase its wealth by producing a large number of delicious fruits every year. Ren Qingmei publicized his plan to the people in the village, persuading everyone he met: "To get rich, plant more trees!" At first, although the people in the village had also seen the film "Michurin," they were not very convinced of his idea. Later, due to Ren Qingmei's repeated propaganda and seeing examples of the benefits of planting trees, they finally increased their enthusiasm and confidence in learning from Michurin to plant trees. The whole village was organized, and they jointly formulated a plan to learn from Michurin, with each person initially setting a goal of planting three to five trees, and launched a tree-planting campaign. During the campaign, Ren Qingmei took the lead as a role model, guiding and helping everyone everywhere. As a result, the whole village planted more than 2,800 trees, more than double the original plan. Liu Qifu alone planted 200 trees. In addition, they also opened a two-mu nursery to prepare to replenish and expand the forest. All the villagers loved their labor, and they also established a forest protection agreement and established a forest protection committee.
    The Wu'an County Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branch, seeing this typical example, made a detailed slideshow of Ren Qingmei's study of Michurin's tree planting and afforestation, and screened it in other parts of the county to encourage the people of the county to learn from Ren Qingmei. Zhao Chengwang from Nancangjing in the Seventh District said: "Ren Qingmei's learning from the Soviet Union is really good! We must learn from Ren Qingmei." Now, in various rural areas of Wu'an County, as the days increase after the screening team leaves, the peasants' enthusiasm and actions in learning from Michurin's tree planting and afforestation are growing day by day. The peasants are creating their own orchards, and in the near future, a large number of high-quality fruits will hang heavily in the orchards of every rural area in Wu'an County.

　　一个学习苏联的典型事迹
    武安县劳模任清美学习米邱林植树造林
    今年二月间，中苏友协总会电影巡回放映队，到河北武安县放映了一次“米邱林”的影片，几天后，放映队走了，“米邱林”的故事却在那里留下了巨大的影响，一件学习苏联的典型事迹发生了。
    武安县中苏友协支会会员任清美是全县的劳动模范，当他看到苏联影片“米邱林”时，便联想到自己村里的土壤不一、树木杂植和苹果树结的苹果很不好的情形，可能就是“米邱林”电影上指出的土壤和品种不适宜的缘故，于是，他决心要学习米邱林来改造自己村里的树木。最初，任清美从二十里外采了二百多株优良苹果树的幼枝，封藏在挖空的白薯里，以防枯死，带了回来，试验接植的结果获得了成功。接着，他又计划着如何适应本村不同的土壤，在白沙地里栽植新品种的苹果树，在沙滩上栽植杨柳，在山沟里种上核桃，同时在山坡上栽植杂树防风，这样来把本村的河滩变成树林，把山坡变成果园。他的村子也将因每年出产大量的好吃的水果，增加许多财富。任清美依照自己的计划向村子里的人进行宣传，见人就劝说：“要发家，多种树！”起初，村里的人虽然也看了“米邱林”的电影，但对他的主张总不太相信，后来，由于任清美的反复宣传，又看到了植树收到好处的实例，终于提高了学习米邱林植树的热情和信心。全村人民组织起来了，共同制定了向米邱林学习的计划，每人先定植树三株到五株，并展开了栽树运动。运动中，任清美带头做模范，处处指导和帮助大家，结果全村共植树二千八百余株，超过原计划一倍，刘起富一人就种了二百株。此外，还辟了二亩苗园，来准备补充和扩充树林。全村人民都热爱自己的劳动，又订立了护林公约，和成立了护林委员会。
    武安县中苏友协支会，见到了这一个典型的事迹，便把任清美学习米邱林植树造林的事迹详细地制成了幻灯片，在全县其他各地放映宣传，鼓动全县人民向任清美学习。七区南丛井赵成旺说：“任清美向苏联学习，真好！咱们要学习任清美。”现在，武安县境的各个农村里，正在随着放映队走后日期的增加，农民们学习米邱林植树造林的热情和行为，一天天地增长起来。农民们创造着自己果木园，不久将来，大量品种优良的水果，将累累地悬挂在武安县每一处农村的果园里。
