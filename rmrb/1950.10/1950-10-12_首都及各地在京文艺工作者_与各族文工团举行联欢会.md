Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Literary and art workers from various ethnic groups who came to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations and literary and art workers from the capital held a grand celebration in Beijing on the 10th, and performed artistic creations from various ethnic groups.

The joint celebration was co-hosted by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Culture and Education, and the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles. It was held at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall in Beijing. A huge banner with the slogan "Literary and Art Workers of All Nationalities of the People's Republic of China Unite Closely" was hung in the venue.

More than 3,000 people attended, including all members of the Southwest Ethnic Minority Cultural Troupe, the Xinjiang Ethnic Minority Cultural Troupe, the Jilin Yanbian Korean Ethnic Minority Cultural Troupe, and the Inner Mongolia Cultural Troupe, as well as literary, drama, film, music, fine arts, dance, and folk art workers from various places in Beijing.

The conference began with Shen Yanbing, Minister of the Central Ministry of Culture and Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, extending a warm welcome to the ethnic minority cultural troupes on behalf of the national literary and art workers. He pointed out that such an unprecedented gathering of literary and art workers of all ethnic groups could only occur in the people's China under the banner of Chairman Mao Zedong. He hoped that all ethnic groups would have more opportunities to exchange experiences in literary and art work in the future, and develop new-democratic literature and art with national forms to a high degree, in accordance with the direction of literary and art work instructed by Chairman Mao.

Then, the Central Ministry of Culture and other four units, as well as the Central Academy of Drama, the China Youth Art Theater, and the Beijing People's Art Theater and other institutions, held a ceremony to present flowers, flags, and banners to the four ethnic minority cultural troupes.

Immediately following, the members of the Southwest Ethnic Minority Cultural Troupe, the Xinjiang Ethnic Minority Cultural Troupe, the Jilin Yanbian Korean Ethnic Minority Cultural Troupe, and the Inner Mongolia Cultural Troupe performed more than 40 kinds of ethnic music and dance programs. Most of these programs were created by the working people and artists of all ethnic groups in the vast and remote border areas of the motherland after liberation. The works have a common theme, which is to praise Chairman Mao. These works vividly express the progressive lives of the people of all ethnic groups after liberation and their infinite gratitude and love for Chairman Mao, and also express the determination of all ethnic groups to unite and defend peace.

The celebration continued for five hours in a warm and joyful atmosphere. That evening, the Central Ministry of Culture, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and other four units jointly held a banquet to entertain all members of the four ethnic minority cultural troupes and all representatives of all ethnic groups who came to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebration.

　　首都及各地在京文艺工作者
    与各族文工团举行联欢会
    【新华社十一日讯】各民族来京参加国庆典礼的文工团和首都的文艺工作者于十日在京举行盛大的联欢会，并表演各民族艺术创作。
    联欢大会由中央人民政府文化部、中华全国文学艺术界联合会、北京市人民政府文教局、北京市文学、艺术界联合会共同主持，在北京中山公园音乐堂举行，会场上高悬着“中华人民共和国各民族文艺工作者亲密团结起来”的巨幅标语。
    到会的有西南各民族文工团、新疆各民族文工团、吉林延边朝鲜族文工团、内蒙文工团等四个文工团的全体团员及各地在京的文学、戏剧、电影、音乐、美术、舞蹈、曲艺工作者共三千多人。
    大会首先由中央文化部部长、全国文联副主席沈雁冰代表全国文艺工作者向各民族文工团表示热烈的欢迎。他指出这种各民族文艺工作者空前的欢聚，只有在毛泽东主席旗帜下的人民的中国才会出现。他希望今后各民族有更多的机会交流文艺工作的经验，按照毛主席指示的文艺工作的方向，高度地发展民族形式的新民主主义文艺。
    接着大会举行了中央文化部等四个单位和中央戏剧学院、中国青年艺术剧院、北京人民艺术剧院等机构向四个各民族的文工团献花、赠旗、献旗的仪式。
    联欢随即由西南各民族文工团、新疆各民族文工团、吉林延边朝鲜族文工团、内蒙文工团等四个文工团的全体团员们表演四十多种民族音乐和舞蹈的节目。这些节目多数是解放以后，在祖国的广大遥远的边疆上，各民族的劳动人民和艺术家的创作。作品中有一个共同主题，就是歌颂毛主席。这些作品生动地表现了各民族人民解放后的进步生活和他们对毛主席的无限的感激和热爱，也表现了各民族团结一致保卫和平的决心。
    联欢会在热烈愉快的气氛中继续了五小时。当晚，中央文化部、全国文联等四单位又联合举行宴会，招待了四个各民族的文工团的全体团员和各民族来京参加国庆节庆祝大会的全体代表。
