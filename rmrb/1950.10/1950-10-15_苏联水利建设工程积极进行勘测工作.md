　　Soviet Water Conservancy Construction Projects Actively Conduct Surveying and Mapping Work
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th] TASS Moscow, 11th: Surveying and mapping work for the construction of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station on the Dnieper River and the excavation of the South Ukraine and North Crimean Canals in the Soviet Union are actively underway. These projects will irrigate 3.2 million hectares of land in Ukraine and Crimea.
　　A large number of jib cranes and other equipment needed for research work have been transported to the construction site of the Dnieper River. Soviet experts are studying the soil, measuring the terrain and the depth of the river. Surveyors are now working hard to solve a major problem - determining the location of hydroelectric power stations, locks, dikes and irrigation sluices. Four topographical survey teams are currently measuring the route of the South Ukraine Canal. They have surveyed a 30-kilometer section of the Dnieper River to the Molochnaya River, where a reservoir with a storage capacity of 6 billion cubic meters will soon be built. Another survey team affiliated with the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union is studying the geological structure in the Nikolaev region, as well as the conditions for planting protective forest belts and building reservoirs.
　　Experts from the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture have come to Crimea from Moscow to participate in determining the route of the North Crimean Canal. Once the canal and hydroelectric power station are completed, the cotton-growing area in Crimea will be increased many times, the orchards and vineyards will be doubled, and the planting area of ​​oil crops will also be greatly increased.

　　苏联水利建设工程积极进行勘测工作
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：苏联建设第聂伯河卡霍夫卡水电站及开凿南乌克兰与北克里米亚运河的勘测工作，正积极进行中。这些工程将使乌克兰与克里米亚的三百二十万公顷的土地受到灌溉。
    第聂伯河的建筑现场已经运到了大批的动臂起重机，及其他研究工作所需的设备。苏联专家们正在研究土壤、测量地形及河水的深度。勘测工作者现正努力解决一个主要的问题——确定建筑水电站、水闸、防水堤和灌溉水门的地点。四个地形考察队现正测量南乌克兰运河的路线。他们已考察了第聂伯河至莫洛奇纳雅河的三十公里的地段，一个贮水六十亿立方公尺的蓄水池即将建于该处。苏联乌克兰科学院所属另一考察队，正在尼科来夫地区研究地质构成，及种植防护林带和建筑蓄水池的条件。
    苏联农业部的专家们已从莫斯科来到克里米亚，参与决定北克里米亚运河路线的工作。运河与水力发电站一经完工，克里米亚植棉地区即将增加许多倍，果园与葡萄园将增加一倍，榨油植物的种植面积亦将大为增加。
