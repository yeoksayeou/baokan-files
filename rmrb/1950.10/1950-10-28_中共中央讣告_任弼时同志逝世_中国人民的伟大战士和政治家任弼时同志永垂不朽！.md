　　CPC Central Committee Obituary
    Comrade Ren Bishi Passes Away
    Eternal Glory to Comrade Ren Bishi, Great Warrior and Statesman of the Chinese People!
    [Xinhua News Agency, 27th] The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sadly announces: Comrade Ren Bishi, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee, passed away due to a cerebral hemorrhage at 12:36 on October 27th, after more than a year of illness. Comrade Ren Bishi was one of the earliest members and organizers of the Communist Party of China. From 1920, when he joined the Socialist Youth League at the age of sixteen, until his death at the age of forty-six, Comrade Ren Bishi devoted his thirty years of life entirely to the great revolutionary cause of China's national liberation, people's liberation, and the liberation of the working class, especially to the organizational work of the Communist Party of China and the political work of the People's Liberation War. In the work of the Chinese Socialist Youth League and the Chinese Communist Youth League, in the struggle against Chen Duxiu's opportunist errors within the Communist Party of China in 1927, in the arduous struggle of building the Red Army and leading the Second and Fourth Front Armies to successfully complete the Long March during the Land Revolution War, and in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, Comrade Ren Bishi left indelible achievements. Comrade Ren Bishi was one of Comrade Mao Zedong's close comrades-in-arms. Because of his infinite loyalty to the cause of the Chinese people and because of his principled and self-sacrificing spirit in his work, he was loved by the entire Party and the entire army. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China calls on all Party members, all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, all members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and all patriotic people of China to learn from Comrade Ren Bishi's example, unite as one, and strive to oppose the aggression of American imperialism, consolidate the national defense of the people's motherland, and continue to develop the people's revolutionary struggle and the people's construction cause, in order to compensate for the loss caused by Comrade Ren Bishi's death. May eternal glory belong to Comrade Ren Bishi, great warrior and statesman of the Chinese people!
