Nantong Private Dasheng Textile Company

Achieves Break-Even Production Through Multiple Economies and Improved Management

[This newspaper's Nantong dispatch] The Nantong private Dasheng No. 1 Textile Company, through the joint efforts of labor and management, has initially improved its management and increased production. It has reversed the serious loss-making situation and has begun to achieve break-even production, and workers' welfare has also improved accordingly.

Dasheng No. 1 Textile Company is a large-scale private enterprise with a history of more than fifty years. It has two textile factories, Factory No. 1 and the Auxiliary Factory, and a power plant. It has a total of 8,100 employees, more than 102,000 spindles (currently operating more than 93,700 spindles), and 915 looms (currently operating 860 looms).

The company is close to cotton-producing areas, which makes the supply of raw cotton convenient, and is located near a developed area of ​​hand-woven fabric industry, so the prospect of development is great.

After the liberation of Nantong, the company encountered many difficulties in the process of the entire national economy transforming from a semi-feudal and semi-colonial economy to a new democratic economy, and suffered heavy losses. All employees actively improved output and quality, improved work efficiency, saved materials and raw materials, and improved the utilization value of machines in order to overcome the difficulties. The People's Government also vigorously supported the company to solve difficulties such as shortages of raw materials, fuel, sales channels, and funds, so that the company could maintain production.

The company had an unwieldy structure, overstaffing, and lacked production and sales plans. Its finances lacked a sound system of revenue and expenditure budgeting, resulting in serious waste and excessively high production costs. According to the company's calculations on June 19, it would lose 41.5 discount units for each yarn it spun and weaved for the Huasha Cloth Company, and more than 80 units if it spun it itself.

On July 7 this year, the company, based on the suggestions of its employees, proposed a plant affairs reform plan to streamline the organization, simplify personnel, save expenses, and improve management. The trade union led all employees in discussions and unanimously agreed with the company's spirit of reforming plant affairs. For the sake of long-term interests, all employees agreed to appropriately reduce the promotion and suspension rice subsidies under the principle of mutual benefit between labor and capital, so that the cost of each yarn was reduced by 15 discount units.

The company first made efforts to save materials, reducing the consumption of commonly used materials by 10%; the repair department made every effort to use waste materials; the electricity for outdoor lighting in the factory was reduced from 11,000 kWh per month to 8,000 kWh. These efforts reduced the cost of each box of yarn by more than 6 discount units. In addition, the public welfare undertakings borne by the company (local undertakings such as schools and hospitals run in the local area) also carried out savings, so that the cost of each yarn was further reduced by 3 discount units.

In order to further reduce costs, workers worked hard to increase production. The yarn output of the old factory in Factory No. 1 increased from an average of 0.75 pounds per spindle in 24 hours to the specified standard of more than 0.85 pounds, with a maximum of 0.879 pounds; the new factory increased to 0.93 pounds; the auxiliary factory generally reached 0.93 pounds, with a maximum of more than 1.05 pounds. The output of cloth in Factory No. 1 has exceeded the specified standard (43 pounds per machine per 12 hours) by 2.22 yards, and the auxiliary factory has also exceeded the standard. The quality of yarn has also been significantly improved; the tensile strength, weight, and twist of yarn are close to the standard. The rate of defective cloth has also been reduced.

Due to the continued improvement of the national economic situation and the improvement of production efficiency of all employees, coupled with the company's efforts in reform, the company began to achieve break-even production after September and has already had a slight surplus.

As the company's business situation improved, workers' welfare also improved accordingly. From August 20, the company resumed maternity allowances for female workers, paid according to 45 days' wages; from October 1, the company will allocate 2% of the actual total wages of all employees it hires to the trade union as trade union funds on a monthly basis, in accordance with the Trade Union Law; in addition, it accepted employees' opinions and added ventilation equipment or windows to the workshops; a Shuhang bridge was built for workers who frequently travel back and forth; radios were installed in workshops and dormitories; the sanitation of female workers' dormitories, canteens, toilets, and bathrooms was improved; and the organization of the clinic was strengthened.

Regarding the issues of streamlining the organization and simplifying personnel, the company has established a personnel research group under the labor-capital consultation meeting, and is continuing to negotiate in order to gradually reform on the basis of break-even production, so that production and management can be completely rationalized and steadily developed.

　　南通私营大生纺织公司
    多方节约改善经营现已达到保本生产
    【本报南通讯】南通市私营大生第一纺织公司在劳资双方共同努力下，初步改善了经营，提高了生产，已扭转严重赔累现象，开始达到保本生产，工人福利也随之改善。
    大生第一纺织公司是一个有五十余年历史，规模较大的私营企业，所属有一厂和副厂两个纺织厂，和一个电厂。共有职工八千一百人，纱锭十万二千余枚（现开动九万三千七百余枚），布机九百十五台（现开动八百六十台）。
    该公司接近产棉区，原棉取给便利，紧靠着手工织布业发达地区，发展前途很大。
    南通解放后，该公司在整个国民经济由半封建半殖民地经济蜕变为新民主主义经济的过程中，曾遭遇不少困难，亏累不堪。全体职工为了度过困难，积极提高产量品质，提高工作效率、节约物料原料，提高机器使用价值。人民政府也大力扶植该公司解决原料、燃料、销路及资金不足等困难，使该公司得以维持生产。
    该公司机构臃肿，人浮于事，且缺乏生产、营业计划，财务上缺乏健全的收支预决算制度，浪费现象严重，生产成本过高。据六月十九日该公司计算，给花纱布公司代纺代织一件纱，要亏折四十一个半折实单位，如果自纺，要亏八十多个单位。
    本年七月七日，公司方面根据职工建议，提出紧缩机构，精简人事，节约开支，改善经营等厂务改革方案。工会领导全厂职工进行讨论，一致同意公司提出的改革厂务的精神。全厂职工为长远利益打算，同意在劳资两利的原则下，适当地降低了升工、停工米贴，使每件纱成本降低十五个折实单位。
    公司方面首先努力节约物料，使常用物料消耗量减少一成；修理科尽量利用废料；工场外照明电灯，由每月一万一千度，减为八千度。这些努力使每箱纱成本降低六个多折实单位。除此以外，由公司负担费用的公益事业（在当地所办的学校、医院等地方事业）本身，也进行了节约，使每件纱成本再减少三个折实单位。
    为更进一步减低成本，工人努力提高生产。纱的产量，一厂老厂由每锭二十四小时平均出数○·七五磅提高到规定标准○·八五磅以上，最高至○·八七九磅；新厂提高至○·九三磅；副厂一般达到○·九三磅，最高达一·○五磅以上。布的产量，一厂已超过规定标准（每台车每十二小时四十三磅）二·二二码，副厂也超过标准。纱的质量也有显著提高；纱的拉力、重量、捻度均接近标准。布的次布率也已减低。　
    由于全国经济情况的继续好转，全体职工生产效率提高，再加上公司在改革方面已作的努力，该公司九月份以后，开始达到保本生产，并已略有盈余。
    公司营业情况好转，职工福利也随之改善。该公司八月二十日起恢复女工生育津贴，按四十五天工资发给；十月一日起按工会法规定资方将所雇全部职工实际工资总额的百分之二，按月拨交工会作为工会经费；此外并接受职工意见，增添了车间的通风设备或窗户；修建了一条工人来往频繁的疏航桥，工房、宿舍均装置了收音机；改善了女工宿舍、膳堂、厕所、浴室的卫生；加强了诊疗所组织。
    关于紧缩机构、精简人事问题，该公司已在劳资协商会议下成立了人事研究小组，现正在继续进行协商，以求在保本生产的基础上，逐渐改革，使生产经营做到完全合理化稳步发展。
