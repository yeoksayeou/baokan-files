Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, October 24th: The Central Committee of the Vietnam National United Front (Viet Lien) and the Steering Committee of the Viet Minh Front issued a joint statement on October 20th, calling on all its cadres and members to mobilize all the Vietnamese people and accelerate preparations for a general counter-offensive, following the recent victory against the French imperialist troops on the northern border. Recalling the battle between Cao Bằng and Thất Khê earlier this month, the statement exposed the French imperialists' attempts to compensate for their major defeats on the northern border. The statement said: On October 1st, French troops once occupied Thái Nguyên, the provincial capital 40 miles north of Hanoi, with the aim of relieving the pressure on the Vietnamese People's Army on the Cao Bằng - Lạng Sơn highway, restoring its prestige lost after the defeat at Đông Khê, disrupting our autumn harvest, and cutting off our transportation lines north of Hanoi. However, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has crushed this aggression plan of the French imperialists. At this time of great recent victories, the cadres and members of the Viet Lien and Viet Minh must cooperate more closely with the military and political organs to complete the following tasks: 1. Continue to eliminate the main force of the enemy; 2. Further develop guerrilla warfare in the enemy-occupied areas; 3. Intensify propaganda work against the enemy; 4. Smash the enemy's "autumn harvest offensive" plan and strive to protect the autumn harvest; 5. Resolutely resist the enemy's mopping-up operations; defend government organs and economic enterprises; 6. Reduce the enemy's occupied areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Lạng Sơn, October 25th: The General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army issued a communiqué on October 24th, announcing the Vietnamese People's Army's liberation of the important northern border town of Lạng Sơn and the nearby Đồng Đăng, Zhennanguan (Note: a market town within Vietnam, located opposite Zhennanguan in Guangxi Province, China) and Lộc Bình. The original text of the communiqué is as follows: After annihilating most of the French 3rd Foreign Legion Parachute Battalion and the 2nd Battalion of the French 5th Foreign Legion Infantry Regiment, which fled from Thất Khê to Na Sầm, the Vietnamese People's Army forces entered Lạng Sơn at 7:00 PM on October 18th. The remaining enemy troops fled to the Đình Lập-Tiên Yên area east of Lạng Sơn and the An Châu southeast of Lạng Sơn. Although the French army destroyed the transportation lines and the iron bridge in Lộc Bình, the People's Army troops still pursued the enemy, inflicting losses on the fleeing French troops between the Chinese border and Lộc Bình east of Lạng Sơn. The People's Army seized a large amount of military supplies and equipment. People's Army troops have controlled the cities of Lạng Sơn, Đồng Đăng, Lộc Bình, and Zhennanguan. Fighting is still in progress in the Tiên Yên area.

Xinhua News Agency, Thái Nguyên, October 25th: Local troops and militia of the Vietnamese People's Army fiercely attacked the French troops who were looting around Thái Nguyên, the provincial capital 40 miles north of Hanoi, earlier this month. From September 29th to October 8th, the People's Army killed about 300 enemy troops and wounded 200 enemy troops. Most of these enemy troops were remnants of Kuomintang mercenary troops (referring to Kuomintang bandit troops who fled to Vietnam). On October 4th, People's Army troops shot down a French Dakota aircraft near Thái Nguyên.

    【新华社二十六日讯】越南通讯社北越二十四日讯：越南国民联合会（越联）中央委员会与越盟战线指导委员会十月二十日发表联合声明，号召其所有干部与会员在最近对北部边界法帝国主义军队的胜利以后，动员全越南人民，加速准备总反攻。该声明在追述了本月初高平与七溪之间的战役以后，揭露了法帝国主义者想要补偿其北部边境重大失败的企图。声明称：十月一日法军曾一度占领了河内以北四十英里的太原省会，其目的在减轻越南人民军在高平——谅山公路上的压力，恢复它在东溪失败后失去的声势，破坏我们的秋收，切断我们河内以北的交通线。然而越南民主共和国政府已经粉碎了法帝国主义者的这种侵略计划。在最近获得巨大胜利的时候，越联与越盟的干部与会员们必须与军政机关更密切的合作，以便完成下列任务：一、继续消灭敌军主力；二、在敌占区更进一步发展游击战争；三、加紧对敌军的宣传工作；四、粉碎敌人“秋收攻势”的计划，努力保护秋收；五、坚决抵抗敌人的扫荡战；保卫政府机关与经济企业；六、缩小敌人的占领区。
    【新华社二十六日讯】越南通讯社谅山二十五日讯：越南人民军总部二十四日发表公报，宣布越南人民军解放北部边境重镇谅山及附近的同登、镇南关（按系越南境内的一个集镇，位于我国广西省辖境镇南关的国界对面）与禄平的经过。公报原文如下：越南人民军部队于歼灭了自七溪逃往那岑的法国第三外籍伞兵营与法国第五外籍步兵团第二营的大部分以后，于十月十八日下午七时进入谅山。残余敌军向谅山以东的亭立——仙安地区及谅山东南的安潮逃去。虽然法军破坏了交通线和禄平的铁桥，人民军部队仍然穷追敌人，在中国边境与谅山以东的禄平之间，使逃窜的法军遭受损失。人民军缴获大量军火与装备。人民军部队已经控制了谅山、同登、禄平、与镇南关等城市。战斗仍在仙安地区进行中。
    【新华社二十六日讯】越南通讯社太原二十五日讯：越南人民军地方部队与民兵，猛烈打击本月初在河内以北四十英里太原省会周围进行劫掠的法军。从九月二十九日到十月八日，人民军约击毙敌军三百人，击伤敌军二百人。这些敌军大部分是国民党雇佣兵（按指逃往越南的国民党匪军）的残部。人民军部队十月四日在太原附近，击落法军达科他式飞机一架。
