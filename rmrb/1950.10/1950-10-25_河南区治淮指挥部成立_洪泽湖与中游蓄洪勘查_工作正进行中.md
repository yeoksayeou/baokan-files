Wu Zhipu, Chairman of the Henan Provincial People's Government, and Zhang Xi, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, serve as the Commander-in-Chief and Political Commissar of the Headquarters, respectively. After the establishment of the Huai River Upper Reaches Engineering Bureau, it dispatched a survey team of more than 200 people on October 17th to the main and tributary areas of the Huai River in Henan to conduct surveys for flood storage and drainage projects.

In the midstream area: The Huai River Water Conservancy Engineering General Bureau, the Huai River Midstream Engineering Bureau, and the Wanbei Administrative Office Water Conservancy Bureau are jointly responsible for the measurement of the main dikes. The section from Zhengyangguan upstream to the Henan border has been largely measured. The channel improvement projects in the lower reaches of the Huai River tributaries, including the Wo River, Ying River, Xifei River, Ci River, Meng River, and Sui River, have also been surveyed. Flood storage surveys of Hongze Lake and other areas in the midstream of the Huai River are currently underway.

People's governments at all levels in the Wanbei District are mobilizing local laborers to prepare various tools for digging and transporting earth. The Midstream Huai River Harnessing Headquarters has ordered 800 dragon bone waterwheels, 5,500 stone rollers, and more than a dozen water pumps. The Huai River Engineering General Bureau has allocated 20,000 foreign-made picks and 100 water pumps to the midstream, which will soon be shipped to Bengbu. In addition, grain depots and supply stations along the river in the midstream are being established one after another, and more than 600 cadres are organizing water and land transportation supply work. Telephone lines along the river are also being repaired and erected.
