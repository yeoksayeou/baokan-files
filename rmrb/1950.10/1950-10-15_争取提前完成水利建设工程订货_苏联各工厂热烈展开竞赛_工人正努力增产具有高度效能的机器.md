　　Xinhua News Agency, 12th: A comprehensive TASS dispatch reports that industrial enterprises across the Soviet Union are enthusiastically launching a competition movement to strive for the early completion of various important orders required for the Volga River, Dnieper River, and Turkmen water conservancy projects.

　　The Sverdlov Machine Tool Plant in Stalingrad has manufactured universal drilling machines to drill parts for large turbines. This machine tool, manufactured for the first time in the Soviet Union, has higher efficiency than foreign-made ones. Workers at the Sverdlovsk Compressor Factory are completing three to four times their quotas every shift.

　　Machine-building factories in Ukraine have sent a large number of powerful dredgers, conveyors, automatic cranes, and other machinery to Kuibyshev. Many factories in Kiev and Kharkov are manufacturing dredgers that are five times more efficient than current ones. Arkhangelsk sent timber, the Volta factory in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, sent electric motors, and workers in Voronezh sent huge excavators. Trains heading to the Volga River are all marked with "Support for Kuibyshev and Stalingrad Hydropower Stations."

　　Soviet scientists and designers are creating new types of machines and studying new methods for constructing water conservancy projects. Personnel from the National Cotton Planting Design Bureau in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, have designed new machines for implementing new irrigation work. Two young scientists in Novosibirsk have created a new method for fixing shifting sands. The Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Academies of Sciences of various republics have established committees to assist in the rapid implementation of construction plans. The Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences has dispatched a group of scientists to the Stalingrad region to assist engineering design agencies in selecting sites for the construction of new cities. The Academy has discussed issues related to the medical services for construction workers and has formulated detailed plans with local public health agencies to protect the health of workers participating in the great construction projects.

　　争取提前完成水利建设工程订货
    苏联各工厂热烈展开竞赛
    工人正努力增产具有高度效能的机器
    【新华社十二日讯】综合塔斯社消息：苏联全国的工业企业热烈展开竞赛运动，以争取提前完成伏尔加河、第聂伯河和土库曼的水利工程所需的各种重要定货。
    斯大林格勒斯维德罗夫工作母机制造厂已制造出万能钻孔机，以便为大透平机的零件钻孔。这种在苏联首次制造出的工作母机，比外国造的具有更高的效能。斯维德罗夫斯克的压缩机制造厂的工人，每一班能完成三倍到四倍的定额。
    乌克兰的机器制造厂已向古比雪夫送出大批效力强大的挖泥机、输送器、自动起重机及其他机械。基辅和哈尔科夫的许多工厂，正在制造效力比目前大五倍的挖泥机。亚尔干日尔斯克送去木材，爱沙尼亚首都塔林的伏尔塔工厂送去电力马达，佛罗内兹工人送去巨大的挖掘机。开到伏尔加河去的火车上，都写着“支援古比雪夫和斯大林格勒水电站。”
    苏联的科学家与设计师都在创造新式的机器，并研究建筑水利工程的新方法。乌兹贝克首都塔什干的国立植棉设计局的人员，已设计了实施新灌溉工作的新机器。新西伯利亚两位青年科学家创造了固定流沙的新方法。苏联科学院和各加盟共和国均成立了协助建设计划迅速实现的委员会。苏联医药科学院主席团已派遣一批科学家前往斯大林格勒地区，协助工程设计机关选定建筑新城市的地点。该院曾讨论了有关建筑工人的医疗服务问题，并与当地的公共卫生机关拟订详细计划，以保护参加伟大建设工程的劳动者的健康。
