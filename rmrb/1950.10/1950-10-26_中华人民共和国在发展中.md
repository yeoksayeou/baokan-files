　　The People's Republic of China is Developing
    Ye. Kavalev
    October 1, 1950, marked the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The establishment of the People's Republic was the result of the Chinese people's heroic struggle to liberate their motherland from the long-term oppression of foreign capital and the rule of feudal reactionaries.

    The victory of the Soviet Union in World War II had a decisive impact on the development of the Chinese people's liberation movement. Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, said in July 1949, "If there had been no Soviet Union, if there had been no victory in the anti-fascist Second World War, if Japanese imperialism had not been defeated, if new democratic countries had not emerged... then, the international reactionary forces weighing down on us would certainly have been many times greater than they are now. Under such circumstances, could we have won? Obviously, we could not."

    In its first year since its founding, the People's Republic of China has achieved significant successes in political and economic spheres and has consolidated its international position. An extremely important event in the life of the young republic was the signing in Moscow on February 14, 1950, of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, the agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushunkou (Port Arthur), and Dalian, the agreement on the Soviet government granting long-term economic loans to the People's Republic of China, and the subsequent agreements on the establishment of joint Soviet-Chinese stock companies signed on March 27, 1950. These historically significant documents forever guarantee the friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China and demonstrate the great principles of Stalin's foreign policy. Every line and word of the treaty and agreements is filled with a spirit of sincere mutual respect for the national independence and interests of the two great friendly peoples.

    The treaty and agreements are a great contribution to the cause of consolidating peace and democracy. They demonstrate the determination of the contracting parties to unite their forces to fight against imperialist aggression. The friendly cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union strengthens its international position and protects it from the infringement of imperialist plunderers. The Chinese people know that their friendship with the Soviet people is a solid guarantee for China's further democratic development.

    The Chinese people welcomed the conclusion of this treaty and various agreements with extreme satisfaction. The foundation of this treaty and the various agreements is the Soviet Union's selfless desire: a desire to help the Chinese people build a peaceful, democratic, and economically strong China; a desire to strengthen economic and cultural ties between the two countries. Mao Zedong explained the significance of the Sino-Soviet treaty at the Third Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee (June 1950): This treaty "on the one hand, enables us to let go and carry out domestic construction work faster, and on the other hand, is promoting the great struggle of the people of the world to strive for peace and democracy against war and oppression."

    The Chinese people's revolution has inflicted a crushing blow on the entire imperialist system, opening up vast prospects for the construction of a new China. The working class, peasants, and other democratic strata, swept up by a great political and labor upsurge, have, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, embarked on the great task of the democratic renewal of China.

    The Chinese Communist Party—the vanguard of the working class, the victorious organizer and inspirer of the Chinese people—guided by Marxism-Leninism and relying on the Soviet Union's experience in socialist construction, is building a people's democratic state in China.

    Millions of Chinese people are following the Communist Party. The Communist Party is a warrior who self-sacrificingly and consistently struggles for the interests of the working people and against foreign and feudal oppression in China.

    The influence and prestige of the Communist Party in China have grown immeasurably. Its membership has exceeded five million; at the Party's Seventh National Congress held in April 1945, the membership was only 1.2 million.

    In view of the great development of its ranks, the Chinese Communist Party, in order to strengthen its combat capability to solve the new and complex tasks of building the republic, is striving to improve the political level of its members, promote democracy, criticism and self-criticism within the Party, and maintain the purity of the Party ranks. The Third Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee held in June 1950 adopted resolutions on the ideological and political education of new members and on adjusting the development of the Party. The task is to increase the worker component within the Party, adjust the development of rural Party organizations, and resolutely fight against the infiltration of alien elements into the Party. In early July this year, the Party Central Committee passed resolutions on eliminating bureaucracy, commandism, pride, and complacency in individual links of the Party.

    The Chinese Communist Party successfully leads the People's Democratic United Front; the People's Democratic United Front was formed at the People's Political Consultative Conference (initiated by the Communist Party and convened in Beijing in September 1949). Since the declaration of the establishment of the republic, the People's Front has been greatly consolidated. The influence of the Communist Party has grown. All bourgeois and petty-bourgeois parties and mass organizations participating in the People's Front recognize the leading role of the Communist Party in leading China's national political life. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is the organizational form of the People's Front.

    The Third Plenary Session and the subsequent Second Plenary Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference were held under the sign of mobilizing the forces of the People's Front to solve the basic problems of the transformation work in China's political and economic fields, and to strengthen the worker-peasant alliance. The National Committee meeting adopted reports on land reform, adjustment of industry and commerce, taxation system, and cultural and educational work.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the work of unifying the whole of China is being completed. The civil war is coming to an end. The Kuomintang regular army on the mainland has been completely crushed. Except for Tibet, Taiwan, and a few small islands, all the territory of China has been liberated. The republic is turning to the track of peaceful construction. The great creative work of consolidating the central and local people's democratic power, restoring and developing the national economy destroyed by the Japanese occupiers and Kuomintang elements is underway.

    The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference adopted in September 1949 stipulates that the state power of the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The organs through which the people exercise state power are the people's congress at all levels, produced by the people through universal suffrage at the village, city, county, and provincial levels. The people's congress at all levels elects the people's government committees (people's government) at all levels according to administrative divisions. During the adjournment of the people's congress at all levels, the people's government committees at all levels are the organs exercising the power of the levels.

    The highest organ of state power is the National People's Congress, and during the adjournment of the National People's Congress, it is the Central People's Government Committee—the Central People's Government of China. Before the convening of the National People's Congress elected by universal suffrage, the plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference exercises its functions.

    The state power organs of the People's Republic of China are established on the basis of these constitutional provisions. At present, the Central People's Government and local power organs in various administrative regions are exercising their functions. The Central People's Government was formed by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in the autumn of 1949; the local power organs were established immediately after the Kuomintang army was eliminated in various places.

    The universal establishment of democratic power organs to replace the collapsed Kuomintang power organs requires a long period and a large number of administrative cadres loyal to the cause of people's democracy. In the old liberated areas (the Northeast and some provinces in North China, with a population of about 160 million), military operations have long ended, the counter-revolutionary Kuomintang bandits have been eliminated, social order has been established, and land reform has been implemented. Under these conditions, the election of people's representatives has been carried out, and local power organs—the people's government committee (that is, the people's government) have been elected. In the newly liberated areas, that is, the areas that were only liberated a year or a year and a half ago (these areas account for two-thirds of China's territory, with a population of about 310 million), the military and political power that is temporarily not elected but appointed is exercising its functions. The Central People's Government divides the country into several large administrative regions and organizes the East China Military and Political Committee (its center is Shanghai), the Northwest Military and Political Committee (Xi'an), the Central South Military and Political Committee (Hankou) and the Southwest Military and Political Committee (Chengdu). The military and political committees are eliminating the remnants of the Kuomintang army and bandits, establishing revolutionary order, and preparing for the transition to the power organs that produce elections. For example, before the establishment of people's congresses at all levels (village people's congresses, district people's congresses, etc.) in various places, people's representative conferences from all walks of life are convened first, and the people's representative conferences from all walks of life perform the functions of the people's congresses, that is, they perform the functions of state power organs.

    Recently, most provinces, as well as counties, districts, and cities in the newly liberated areas, have held people's representative conferences from all walks of life. The attendees include representatives from various groups and people from all walks of life: workers, peasants, intellectuals, staff members, handicraftsmen, national bourgeoisie, ethnic minorities, democratic parties, people's organizations, troops, and people of various religions. This representative conference discussed the economic construction and cultural construction of its region, and elected the local power organ—the people's government committee. This representative conference was conducted in an environment where participants freely expressed their opinions. It helps to attract the masses to participate in active national construction work and promote leading cadres from the people.

    The Communist Party believes that, at present, in addition to the issue of power construction, the restoration and further development of China's national economy is also the main task. This is not an easy task. Imperialism has intentionally delayed the development of Chinese industry, especially the development of heavy industry, so that this great country has to be a semi-colonial dependency of the imperialist powers for agricultural raw materials. Imperialist rule, feudal remnants, eight years of Japanese plunder and civil war have severely damaged China's backward economy. When the country emerged from the war, industry was shattered and agriculture weakened. The proportion of industry in the country's entire economy has never exceeded 10 percent, and at this time, it has further decreased. The level of agricultural production in 1949 was 25 to 33 percent lower than in 1937.

    The economy of the People's Republic of China is successfully recovering. In the old liberated areas, many democratic reforms have been implemented before the establishment of the republic, which made the economic recovery work easier. In the newly liberated areas, the national economy is being reborn, and naturally, the speed is slower. The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference requires first restoring and developing the mining industry, the iron and steel industry, the power industry, the machinery manufacturing industry, the chemical industry, and other heavy industrial sectors, in order to rebuild the entire national economy on this basis.

    The center of China's heavy industry is the oldest liberated area—the Northeast. Nearly 60 percent of China's heavy industry and more than 40 percent of its railways are concentrated in the Northeast. This large administrative region has achieved great success in restoring heavy industry. By the end of March 1950, about 90 percent of factories and mines in the Northeast had resumed work. In the first half of 1950, the output of means of production exceeded the total output of means of production in 1949 by 31.5 percent. 40 percent of the Northeast People's Government's 1950 budget expenditure was allocated for industrial needs; and 85 percent of this allocation was for the restoration of Northeast heavy industry. The iron and steel industry, the power industry, the chemical industry, and other heavy industrial sectors in other industrial areas of China are also recovering. The main light industrial sectors, such as the textile industry, the oil pressing industry, the flour industry, the paper making industry, the sugar making industry, the tobacco industry, and the leather industry, are also being revitalized. Transportation work is also rapidly getting on track. By the end of 1949, the railway network in the liberated areas of China had been almost completely restored.

    The financial situation of the republic is becoming increasingly consolidated. What the democratic government obtained from the Kuomintang rule was completely disordered finances, worthless currency, and inflation. The democratic government first began to confiscate the four major banks of the Kuomintang group: the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank, and established strict controls over finance, foreign exchange trading, and foreign exchange remittances. The previous state of anarchy in the financial industry came to an end. All domestic and foreign financial businesses of the state are now handled by the People's Bank of China; this bank has branches in major cities and regions. The Ministry of Finance has implemented unified control over all state revenues and expenditures, such as customs revenue, taxes, and investments.

    The implementation of extremely strict financial control has produced good results. The People's Government is approaching a situation of balanced revenue and expenditure, curbing inflation and stabilizing prices across the country. The purchasing power of the "Yuan" (the monetary unit of the new China) has increased. The plan for collecting public grain tax for the autumn harvest of 1949 was completed by 97 percent. The people purchased more than 90 million shares of the first phase of People's Victory Bonds.

    The most backward sector of the Chinese economy—agriculture—is also successfully reviving. In this regard, the land reform implemented in the old liberated areas and the rent reduction and interest rate reduction in the newly liberated areas have played a decisive role. In the old liberated areas of the Northeast, most areas of North China, and parts of Henan Province, with a total of about 145 million agricultural population, land reform had been basically completed by the end of 1949. In these areas, the land and property of landlords and the surplus land and property of rich peasants have been confiscated and distributed to landless and land-poor peasants. Farmers acquired more than 37 million hectares of land.

    In the newly liberated areas of Central China, East China, South China, Southwest China, and Northwest China, with a total of about 264 million agricultural population, rent reduction of 25 to 35 percent and interest rate reduction are being implemented before land reform.

    In addition, the state is implementing various measures to promote the development of agricultural productivity in China; these measures include: irrigating arid areas, building river dikes, opening new canals, promoting basic agricultural technology and agricultural machinery, and lending materials and farm tools needed for sowing.

    Only at this time has Chinese agriculture begun to slightly recover from the severe consequences of the Japanese occupation and Kuomintang rule. The direct effect of land reform is the gradual increase in sown area and yield. This refers first to the old liberated areas. For example: the Northeast produced 13.2 million tons of agricultural products in 1949, and this year it is planned to increase the harvest to 18 million tons. This year, the grain harvest in China is planned to reach 90 percent of the pre-war level. At present, the area sown with wheat alone has accounted for more than 23 million hectares, almost 2 million hectares more than in 1949. It is estimated that the wheat harvest will be 24 million tons, that is, approximately 4 million tons more than in 1949. There are news from provinces and regions in China that this year's wheat, rice, cotton, and other crops are abundant.

    While the Chinese economy is growing, the political and cultural levels of the people, especially the political and cultural levels of the working class, are also improving. Workers are promoted to take on power work, economic work, and social work.

    The trade union movement has also gained extensive development. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions now has more than 4.1 million members. Trade unions actively participate in China's democratic construction. Trade unions mobilize workers to restore and develop the national economy, and organize movements to improve labor productivity and production rationalization among workers. In private factories, trade unions protect the economic interests of workers and staff by concluding collective contracts with private entrepreneurs. Collective contracts stipulate equal pay for equal work for men and women, determine working hours, labor protection and working conditions, and workers have the right to join trade unions and engage in political and mass activities. Collective contracts are approved by local labor bureaus. Disputes between entrepreneurs and trade unions are arbitrated by labor bureaus.

    The material living standards of the working people are improving. The actual wages in the Northeast have increased by 40 percent compared with 1949. At the beginning of last year, state-owned enterprises in the Northeast began to implement labor insurance. According to the government's decision, the insurance fund is established by drawing 3 percent of the total wages of workers in state-owned enterprises. In addition, local governments also allocate funds for workers' medical expenses.

    Not long ago, in China, only privileged people could receive education. Now, education has become the property of the people. Millions of people who used to be ravaged illiterates are now reaching out for knowledge. The school network is expanding, and the number of students is increasing. According to incomplete statistics, there are now 227 universities and colleges in China, with 130,000 college students; 3,694 middle schools, with 1.09 million middle school students; and 212,890 primary schools, with 16 million primary school students. In 1949, in the Northeast, the children of workers, tenant farmers, poor peasants, and middle peasants accounted for 81 percent of the total number of students. The face of Chinese schools is also changing. All links in the education network are transforming their teaching programs in accordance with the task of building a democratic China. Dialectical materialism and historical materialism, political economy, and Russian are being taught.

    More than 500,000 Chinese workers and peasants are improving their cultural and technical levels in adult schools without leaving their production areas. Great attention is paid to eliminating illiteracy among workers. Tens of millions of citizens of the People's Republic of China are studying in schools that eliminate illiteracy.

    The People's Republic of China has achieved many successes. However, the country is still experiencing some economic difficulties. These difficulties are caused by the semi-colonial status of the country not long ago, imperialist rule, war, Kuomintang rule, and the maritime blockade currently carried out by the Kuomintang and its American masters.

    The Chinese Communist Party believes that the basic political and economic tasks of the republic in the recent years are to implement land reform in accordance with the new land law. The new land law was passed by the Central People's Government Committee of the People's Republic of China on June 28, 1950. The new environment created by the victory of the Chinese revolution and the establishment of the republic, the need to most rapidly eradicate feudal remnants, the task of politically and economically consolidating the people's democratic state, restoring and further improving backward agriculture, and establishing the preconditions for China's industrialization—all of these require revising the 1947 land law, which was mainly adapted to the situation of the civil war.

    The new land law is adapted to the current tasks of the People's Republic of China. It has been welcomed with extreme satisfaction by the people. This land law represents a new stage in the path of democratic resolution of the Chinese land problem. According to the current land law, the landlord land ownership system is abolished, and the land is transferred to the ownership of the people who cultivate the land—the peasants.

    The land and property of the landlords that have been confiscated are distributed by the "xiang" (administrative unit, including several villages) peasant association to landless and land-poor peasants on the basis of the population of the xiang. Landlords who are willing to engage in agricultural labor also receive the same share of land as peasants. Traitors, quislings, war criminals, and counter-revolutionaries who have cooperated with the Japanese occupying authorities do not receive land.

    A new policy is being implemented towards rich peasants. Mao Zedong pointed out at the Third Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee that the party must "change the policy of requisitioning the surplus land and property of rich peasants to a policy of preserving the rich peasant economy in order to facilitate the early restoration of agricultural production." The new land law is different from the 1947 land law which stipulates the confiscation of surplus land and property of rich peasants. According to the new land law, except for special circumstances, the land cultivated by rich peasants themselves or using hired labor, and the property necessary for cultivating the land, are preserved. The land law allows land owners to freely buy and sell and rent land.

    Land reform will be gradually implemented in all newly liberated areas in the next three years (land reform will no longer be implemented in the old liberated areas where land reform has been implemented). At the end of this year and in the spring of 1951, land reform will be implemented in areas with a population of 100 million; in the winter of 1951 and the spring of 1952, land reform will be implemented in another area with a population of 170 to 180 million.

    At present, there are several economic components in the People's Republic of China: small commodity economy—mainly the economy of peasants and handicraftsmen; private capitalist economy—represented by the urban small and medium-sized industrial and commercial bourgeoisie and the rural rich peasants; state-owned economy—cooperatives belong to this category.

    The state plays a very important role in the democratic transformation of the Chinese economy. The state-owned economy is gradually expanding. According to the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the state-owned economy has a socialist nature and "is the main material basis for the development of production and the prosperity of the economy of the People's Republic, and the leading force of the entire social economy." The main economic lifelines of the country are either completely or partially controlled by the state. Railways and postal and telecommunications services are owned by the state. All enterprises of the Chinese big bourgeoisie (comprador), traitors, quislings, Japanese occupiers, and the big banks belonging to the former Kuomintang government have been confiscated.

    In individual heavy industrial sectors, the state-owned part has taken a dominant position: 70 percent of the national coal output, 90 percent of steel production, 50 percent of pig iron, 78 percent of electricity, and 70 percent of machinery manufacturing are produced by state-owned enterprises.

    In the old liberated areas, such as the Northeast, 74 percent of the total value of industrial production in 1949 was produced by state-owned enterprises. In the newly liberated areas, the economic life has just begun to get on track, and the proportion of state-owned industry is still small. In most light industrial sectors (such as the paper making industry, the oil pressing industry, the flour industry, etc.), private capital has an advantage. In the textile industry, the proportions of private capital and state capital are almost equal. Since state-owned industry cannot yet fully guarantee the supply to the people with its own products, the state encourages the enthusiasm of private operations, gives private factories orders, supplies them with raw materials, gives them loans, and allows private foreign firms to operate.

    In domestic trade, especially retail trade, private capital dominates. The proportion of state-owned trade is still insignificant for the time being. Foreign trade is controlled by the state, but individual entrepreneurs can trade with foreign countries after being specially licensed by government agencies. The trade of several export goods is monopolized by the state. For example, the export of bristles (China supplies more than 70 percent of the world's needs for bristles) is completely controlled by the state. The proportion of state-owned trading agencies in foreign trade is gradually increasing. In terms of the foreign trade of North China in the first ten months of 1949, the proportion of state-owned enterprises was 38 percent, private enterprises accounted for 45 percent, and foreign firms accounted for 17 percent. From January to April 1950, the proportion of state-owned enterprises in foreign trade has been 65 percent, private enterprises accounted for 26 percent, and foreign firms accounted for 9 percent. However, in general, the proportion of the state-owned component in the Chinese economy is still small.

    With the development of state-owned industry and commerce and credit, the state's influence on agriculture is also increasing, in order to make agriculture participate in the cause of democratic transformation of China. The people's government has begun to pursue a policy of state fixed prices for agricultural products, and has stipulated a unified taxation and loan system. The first batch of state-owned farms has been established.

    Preliminary steps have also been taken on the road of making peasants join cooperatives; the simplest supply and marketing cooperatives and production cooperatives have been established. These cooperatives help to strengthen the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. At present, there are 34,000 cooperatives in rural areas. The simplest production cooperatives have emerged, in the form of mutual aid groups—similar to combinations of jointly cultivating land and harvesting crops, uniting peasants, mainly rural poor people. In mutual aid groups, the private ownership system of land and production tools is retained.

    The state's attitude towards the exploiting classes is determined in accordance with the economic policy of the People's Government. China is different from the people's democratic countries in Central and Southeast Europe. The people's democratic countries in Central and Southeast Europe implemented the nationalization of large and medium-sized industries and national land reform, thereby eliminating the economic foundation of the bourgeoisie and landlords. China currently only nationalizes large capital (comprador), and does not nationalize the capital of small and medium-sized bourgeoisie, because at this stage, the state is interested in attracting their capital. In cities, a policy of restricting capitalist components is implemented, and in rural areas, a policy of eliminating landlord land ownership is implemented.

    The Chinese Communist Party has opened up the road to socialism for the Chinese working people. But today, socialist construction is not yet the direct task of the People's Republic of China. The Communist Party has predetermined a plan to restore and develop the national economy. This plan will inevitably raise the country to a higher stage of the people's democratic system, and will inevitably put the issue of transitioning China to the road of socialist development on the agenda with the passage of time. Regarding this point, Mao Zedong said in his closing remarks at the June meeting of the National Committee of the CPPCC:

    "As long as the war hurdle and the land reform hurdle have passed, the remaining hurdle will be easy to pass, that is, the socialist hurdle, the hurdle of implementing socialist transformation on a national scale... Implementing industrial nationalization and agricultural socialization... is still in the very distant future... After the state's economic and cultural undertakings have greatly prospered, after various conditions are available, after the people of the whole country have considered maturely and with everyone's consent, we can calmly and properly enter the new period of socialism."
        ★                        ★                     ★

    China's democratic construction is encountering fierce resistance from internal and external reactionaries. The class struggle in China is becoming sharp. The bourgeoisie and landlord elements are dissatisfied with the policies of the state, undermine the measures of the people's government, and carry out armed struggles with the people's government. In the newly liberated areas, there are still more than 400,000 bandits active. Kuomintang agents are carrying out anti-republic sabotage work under the direction of US imperialism.

    The existence and consolidation of the People's Republic of China has disintegrated the conspiracies of American war instigators. People in the United States who have crazy ideas of pursuing world hegemony, regardless of the obvious bankruptcy of the US policy towards China, have not given up their attempts to reignite the flames of war in the Far East, and continue to interfere in the internal affairs of the Chinese people, intending to undermine China's democratic construction.

    American aggressors are pressuring their vassals, forcing them not to recognize the People's Republic of China, and preventing it from joining the United Nations.

    The United States continues to support its puppet—Chiang Kai-shek and the remnants of his defeated army who fled to Taiwan. US imperialists have turned Taiwan into their colony. They plunder the island's wealth in a predatory manner and rob the local people. While carrying out economic aggression, the Americans are also stepping up the construction of US naval and air force bases on the island. For this purpose, American interventionists are sending their armed forces to Taiwan.

    On June 27th this year, the US President ordered the US Seventh Fleet in the Pacific to "prevent attacks on Taiwan." This order means a direct act of aggression by the United States against the People's Republic of China, and is in fact an occupation of a part of Chinese territory. In addition, this order brutally violates the Cairo and Potsdam international agreements on Taiwan belonging to China.

    In late August this year, several US military aircraft invaded the airspace of the People's Republic of China in the Yalu River area, strafed several locations, including Andong City, causing deaths and injuries. The US armed intervention in Korea and the US invasion of the territory of the People's Republic of China prove that the United States is strengthening its imperialist aggression against the Far East. US imperialists are vainly attempting to suffocate the national liberation movement in Asia, and want to put the people of China and Korea back in the colonial shackles.

    The UK formally recognized the People's Republic of China, but in fact colludes with the United States. The UK's representative in the United Nations, together with other accomplices of US imperialism, attempts to prevent the legitimate representatives of China from occupying their rightful place in the United Nations. Under the direction of the United States, British imperialists instigated the reactionaries in Tibet to oppose the Central People's Government of China. Tibet, with an area of more than 900,000 square kilometers and a population of about 4 million, is an integral part of China. The people of Tibet demand that the conspiracies of the British and American groups be stopped so that this region can be归属 (be incorporated) into the territory of the People's Republic of China. The Central People's Government of China has reiterated its determination to liberate Tibet and Taiwan.

    The Chinese people are extremely angry at the shameless provocations of war instigators. The government of the People's Republic of China has requested the Security Council to urgently consider the issue of the US Air Force's intrusion into Chinese territory, and has demanded that the United States stop interfering in China's internal affairs and withdraw the US armed forces on Taiwan Island.

    The Soviet Union—the defender of peace in the world—supports China's complaint to the United Nations about the US armed forces' intrusion into Chinese territory. The Soviet delegation to the United Nations supports the statement of the government of the People's Republic of China that the Kuomintang "delegation" does not represent China and cannot speak in the name of the Chinese people. The Soviet Union's consistent and selfless support for China has aroused the gratitude of the Chinese people to their great neighbor.

    China, together with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, is fighting for peace and democracy in the world. In China, the peace movement is unfolding, and the signature campaign on the peace declaration of the World Peace Congress Standing Committee is actively underway. The Chinese people are full of determination to defend peace. Peace is necessary for the construction of the young people's republic.

    Only one year has passed since the founding of the People's Republic of China, but even this short period shows what achievements the people who have thrown off the hateful Kuomintang group and its American masters can achieve. The Chinese people's struggle is still continuing. The Soviet people and all progressive mankind are watching the development of this struggle with joy and firm confidence, firmly believing that the great Chinese people will achieve victory under the leadership of its glorious Communist Party.

　　中华人民共和国在发展中
    耶·卡瓦列夫
    一九五○年十月一日，是中华人民共和国成立的第一周年纪念日。人民共和国的建立，是中国人民从外国资本的长期压迫与封建反动派的统治下争取祖国解放的英勇斗争的结果。
    苏联在第二次世界大战中取得了胜利，这对于中国人民解放运动的发展，给予了决定性的影响。中国人民领袖毛泽东于一九四九年七月说，“假如没有苏联的存在，假如没有反法西斯的第二次世界大战的胜利，假如没有打倒日本帝国主义，假如没有各新民主国家的出现……那么，堆在我们头上的国际反动势力必定比现在不知要大多少倍，在这种情形下，我们能够胜利么？显然是不能的”。
    中华人民共和国在成立以来的第一年间，在政治和经济各方面，已得到了重大的成绩，并且巩固了自己的国际地位。在年青的共和国的生活上极其重要的一件事，乃是一九五○年二月十四日在莫斯科签订苏联与中华人民共和国之间的友好同盟互助条约，关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定，关于苏联政府对中华人民共和国给予长期经济贷款的协定，以及随后于一九五○年三月二十七日签订的关于创办苏中合股公司的各协定。这些有历史意义的文件，永远地保证了苏中两国人民的友谊，表明了斯大林对外政策的伟大原则。条约和各协定的每一行字句，都充满了真诚地互相尊重两大友好人民的民族独立和利益的精神。
    条约和各协定，对于巩固和平与民主的事业，乃是极大的贡献。它们表现出缔约双方有决心要联合自己的力量来与帝国主义侵略作斗争。中华人民共和国与苏联之友好合作，加强着它的国际地位，维护着它不受帝国主义掠夺者的侵害。中国人民知道它与苏联人民友好，乃是中国获得更进一步的民主发展的稳固的保障。
    中国人民极满意地欢迎了这一条约与各协定的缔结。作为这一条约与各协定的基础的，乃是苏联的无私的愿望，即：愿望帮助中国人民建设和平民主的、在经济上强有力的中国，愿望加强两国间的经济联系与文化联系。毛泽东在中共中央三中全会（一九五○年六月）上这样说明了苏中条约的意义：这个条约“一方面使我们能够放手地和较快地进行国内的建设工作，一方面又正在推动着全世界人民争取和平和民主反对战争和压迫的伟大斗争”。
    中国的人民革命，使整个帝国主义体系蒙受了粉碎性的打击，开启了新中国建设的辽阔的远景。工人阶级、农民以及其他民主阶层，为极大的政治高涨和劳动高涨所席卷，在中国共产党的领导下，已着手从事中国之民主的更新的巨大工作。

    中国共产党——工人阶级的先锋队，中国人民的胜利的组织者和鼓舞者——以马克思列宁主义为指南，依靠苏联从事社会主义建设的经验，正在中国建设人民民主的国家。
    千百万中国人民群众，都在跟着共产党走。共产党是为劳动人民的利益和反对中国的外国压迫和封建压迫而自我牺牲地始终一贯地斗争的战士。
    共产党在中国的影响和威信，无可估量地增长了。它的党员人数，已超过了五百万；在一九四五年四月举行党的第七次代表大会时，党员人数还只有一百二十万人。
    中国共产党鉴于自己队伍的极大发展，为了加强自己的战斗能力以解决建设共和国的新的复杂任务，正在力求提高党员的政治水平，发扬党内民主、批评与自我批评，保持党队伍的纯洁性。一九五○年六月举行的中共中央三中全会，通过了关于新党员的思想政治教育以及关于调整党的发展的各项决议。任务是要增加党内的工人成份，调整农村党组织的发展，坚决与异己分子之潜入党内作斗争。今年七月初，党中央通过了关于消除党的个别环节中官僚主义、命令主义与骄傲自满的各决议。
    中国共产党成功地领导着人民民主统一战线；人民民主统一战线，是在人民政治协商会议（由共产党倡议于一九四九年九月在北京召开）上形成的。自共和国宣告成立以来，人民阵线大大地巩固起来了。共产党的影响增长了。一切参加人民阵线的资产阶级与小资产阶级党派以及群众团体，都承认共产党在领导中国国家政治生活方面的主导作用。中国人民政治协商会议，是人民阵线的组织形式。
    三中全会以及随后召开的中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会第二次全体会议，是在这样的标志下举行的：动员人民阵线的力量来解决中国政治和经济各方面改造工作的基本问题，并且加强工农联盟。全国委员会会议，通过了关于土改、关于调整工商业、税收制度、文教工作等报告。
    在共产党的领导下，统一全中国的工作，正在完成。内战已快告结束。大陆上的国民党正规军，已完全被粉碎。除西藏、台湾以及若干小岛外，中国的全部领土已被解放。共和国正在转入和平建设的轨道。巩固中央和地方的人民民主政权，恢复和发展被日本占领者和国民党分子破坏了的国民经济等方面的巨大创造工作，正在进行中。
    一九四九年九月通过的中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领规定：中华人民共和国的国家政权属于人民。人民行使国家政权的机关，为村庄、城市、县、省等级由人民用普选方法产生的各级人民代表大会。各级人民代表大会，按行政区划选举各级人民政府委员会（人民政府）。各级人民代表大会闭会期间，各级人民政府委员会为行使各级政权的机关。
    国家最高政权机关，为全国人民代表大会，在全国人民代表大会闭会期间，则为中央人民政府委员会——中国中央人民政府。在普选的全国人民代表大会召开以前，由中国人民政治协商会议的全体会议执行其职权。
    中华人民共和国的国家政权机构，就是在这些宪法性的规定的基础上建立起来的。目前，全国有中央人民政府以及各行政区划的地方政权机关在行使职权。中央人民政府，是由中国人民政治协商会议于一九四九年秋季予以组成的；地方政权机关，则是在各地肃清国民党军后立即建立的。
    普遍建立民主政权机关来代替崩溃了的国民党政权机构，是需要很长的时期和大量忠诚于人民民主事业的行政干部的。在老解放区（东北以及华北若干省，约有一亿六千万人口），军事行动早已结束，反革命的国民党匪徒已被肃清，社会秩序已建立，土地改革已实行，在这种条件下，已进行人民代表大会的选举，选出了地方政权机关——人民政府委员会（即人民政府）。在新解放区，即一年或一年半以前才解放的地区（这种地区占中国领土的三分之二，约有三亿一千万人口），暂时是由非选举产生而系任命的军政政权行使职权。中央人民政府将全国划分为若干大行政区，并且组织了华东军政委员会（其中心地为上海）、西北军政委员会（西安）、中南军政委员会（汉口）与西南军政委员会（成都）。各军政委员会肃清着国民党军残余和土匪，建立着革命秩序，进行着过渡到产生选举的政权机关的准备工作。例如，在各地各级人民代表大会（村人民代表大会、区人民代表大会等）建立以前，先召开各界人民代表会议，由各界人民代表会议执行人民代表大会的职权，也就是说，执行国家政权机关的职权。
    最近，大多数省份，以及新解放地区的县、区和城市，都举行了各界人民代表会议，出席者有各种团体和各界人民的代表：工人、农民、知识分子、职员、手工业者、民族资产阶级、少数民族、民主党派、人民团体、军队、各种教派人士等。这种代表会议，讨论了自己地区的经济建设与文化建设的问题，并且选出了地方政权机关——人民政府委员会。这种代表会议，是在与会者自由发表意见的环境下进行的，是有助于吸引群众参加积极的国家建设工作和从人民中提拔领导干部的。

    共产党认为，在目前，除了政权建设的问题以外，恢复和更进一步发展中国的国民经济，也是主要的任务。这不是一项容易的任务。帝国主义曾有意地滞延了中国工业的发展，特别是重工业的发展，从而使这个大国不得不做帝国主义强国的农业原料的半殖民地属地。帝国主义的统治，封建残余，日本人的八年掠夺以及内战，严重地破坏了中国的落后的经济。这个国家在走出战争时，工业破碎了，农业减弱了。工业在全国整个经济中所占的比重，是从来没有超过百分之十的，这时候，则更加减少了。一九四九年的农业生产水平，比一九三七年减低了百分之二十五到三十三。
    中华人民共和国的经济，正在成功地恢复着。老解放区在共和国成立以前，就已实行了许多民主改革，从而使经济恢复工作较容易进行了。在新解放区，国民经济在新生中，自然，其速度是较慢的。中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领，要求首先恢复和发展矿业、钢铁业、动力工业、机器制造业、化学工业以及其他重工业部门，以便在这个基础上重建整个国民经济。
    中国重工业的中心地，是最老的解放区——东北。中国重工业将近百分之六十和铁路百分之四十以上，都集中在东北。这个大行政区在恢复重工业方面，已获得了很大的成绩。到一九五○年三月底时，东北的工厂和矿场约百分之九十都复工了。一九五○年上半年生产资料的产量，超过一九四九年生产资料总产量百分之三十一点五。东北人民政府一九五○年预算的支出，百分之四十是拨供工业需要之用的；并且这一拨款的百分之八十五，是供恢复东北重工业之用的。中国其他工业区的钢铁业、动力工业、化学工业以及其他重工业部门，也在恢复中。主要的轻工业部门，如纺织业、榨油业、面粉业、造纸业、制糖业、烟草业、皮革业等，也在复兴中。交通工作也迅速地上轨道了。到一九四九年年底时，中国解放地区的铁路网，几乎已完全恢复。
    共和国的财经情况，正在日益巩固。民主政权从国民党统治手中得来的是完全紊乱了的财政，不值钱了的货币，通货膨胀。民主政权首先开始没收国民党集团的四大银行：中央银行、中国银行、交通银行与农民银行，并且对金融、外汇买卖与对外汇款，建立了严格的管制。金融业从前的无政府状态，告一结束。国家现在对内对外的一切金融业务，都由中国中央人民银行办理；这个银行，在各大城市和地区，都设有分行。财政部对国家的一切收支：如海关收入、税收、投资等，实行了统一的管制。
    实行极严格的财政管制，已产生了好效果。人民政府走近了收支平衡、制止通货膨胀与全国物价平稳的情况。人民“元”（新中国的货币单位）的购买力提高起来了。对一九四九年的秋收征公粮的计划，完成了百分之九十七。人民购买了人民胜利公债第一期债券九千万分以上。
    中国经济的最落后的部门——农业，也在成功地复兴中。在这方面，老解放区已实行的土地改革与新解放区的减租减息，起了决定性的作用。东北老解放区、华北大部地区以及河南省的一部分，总共约有一亿四千五百万农业人口的地区，到一九四九年年底时，土地改革已基本上完成。在这些地区，地主的土地和财产，富农的多余的土地和财产，已被没收和分配给无地少地的农民。农民获得了三千七百万余公顷土地。
    在华中、华东、华南、西南、西北总共约有二亿六千四百万农业人口的新解放区，在实行土地改革以前，正在实行减租百分之二十五到三十五和实行减息。
    此外，国家正在实行种种措施来促进中国农村生产力的发展；这些措施如像：灌溉干旱地区，修筑河堤，开设新运河，推广基本的农业技术与农业机器，借贷播种需用物资与农具。
    只是在这时候，中国的农业才开始从日本占领和国民党统治的惨重后果下稍稍恢复元气。土地改革的直接效果，就是播种面积与收获率的逐渐增大。这首先是指老解放区而言的。例如：东北一九四九年出产了一千三百二十万吨农产品，今年则计划把收成提高到一千八百万吨。今年全中国的谷物收获量，计划使之达到战前水平的百分之九十。目前仅是小麦的播种地，就已占二千三百万余公顷，比一九四九年几乎多二百万公顷。据估计，小麦的收获将为二千四百万吨，也就是说，比一九四九年大致多四百万吨。中国各省和各区，都有消息来说今年的小麦、大米、棉花和其他农作物的收成很丰富。
    在中国经济高涨的同时，人民群众的政治水平与文化水平，首先是工人阶级的政治水平与文化水平，也在提高。工人们被提拔去担任政权工作、经济工作与社会工作。
    工会运动也获得了广大的发展。中华全国总工会现在已有四百一十万余会员。工会积极地参加着中国的民主建设。工会动员着劳动者去恢复与发展国民经济，在工人中组织着提高劳动生产率与生产合理化的运动。在私营工厂，工会用与私营企业主缔结集体合同的方法，保护着工人与职员的经济利益。集体合同规定男女同工同酬，确定工作时间、劳动保护和劳动条件、工人有权加入工会和从事政治活动与群众活动等。集体合同由各地的劳动局批准。企业主与工会之间发生的争议问题，由劳动局仲裁。
    劳动人民的物质生活水平正在提高。东北的实际工资，比一九四九年增加了百分之四十。去年年初，东北的国营企业开始实行劳动保险。根据政府的决定，保险基金系由国营企业工人工资总额中抽百分之三建立的。此外，地方政府还拨发款项作工人的医疗费。
    就在不久以前，在中国，只有享有特权的人们能受教育。现在，教育则成为人民的财产了。千百万人过去是受蹂躏的文盲，现在伸手要知识了。学校网正在扩大，学生人数正在增加。根据不完全的统计，中国现在有二百二十七所高等学校，有大学生十三万人；有三千六百九十四所中学，有中学生一百零九万人；有二十一万二千八百九十所小学，有小学生一千六百万人。一九四九年，在东北，工人、雇农、贫农、中农的子弟，占学生总数的百分之八十一。中国学校的面貌也在改变。教育网的各环节，都在按照建设民主中国的任务而改造自己的教学方案。辩证唯物论与历史唯物论、政治经济学、俄文，都开始讲授起来了。
    五十余万中国工人与农民，已在成人学校中不脱离生产地提高着自己的文化水平与技术水平。对于扫除劳动者中的文盲，是给予极大的注意的。中华人民共和国的成千万公民，正在扫除文盲的学校中学习。
    中华人民共和国已取得了很多成绩。然而，这个国家现在还在经受若干经济困难。这些困难，是不久以前该国的半殖民地地位、帝国主义统治、战争、国民党统治以及国民党及其美国主子目前进行的海上封锁等后果所造成的。

    中国共产党认为，共和国最近若干年的基本政治经济任务，就是根据新土地法实行土地改革。新土地法是一九五○年六月二十八日中华人民共和国中央人民政府委员会通过的。中国革命胜利与共和国成立的结果所造成的新环境，最迅速地根绝封建残余的必要性，从政治上和经济上巩固人民民主国家的任务，恢复和更进一步提高落后的农业，建立中国工业化的先决条件——这一切，都要求改订一九四七年那种主要是适应内战情况的土地法。
    新土地法，是适应中华人民共和国当前的任务的。它受到了人民群众极满意的欢迎。这一土地法，代表了民主解决中国土地问题的道路的新阶段。根据现行的土地法，地主的土地所有制被废除了，土地转属耕种土地的人们——农民所有。
    没收得来的地主的土地与财产，由“乡”（行政单位，包括若干村庄）农民协会按该乡人口数平均分配给无地少地的农民。愿意从事农业劳动的地主，也获得与农民同样一份土地。曾与日本占领当局合作的汉奸、卖国贼、战争罪犯与反革命分子，得不到土地。
    对富农开始实行新的政策。毛泽东在中共中央三中全会上指出，党必须“由征收富农多余土地财产的政策，改变为保存富农经济的政策，以利于早日恢复农业生产”。新土地法不同于规定要没收富农的多余土地财产的一九四七年土法地。根据新土地法，除了特殊情况以外，保存富农自耕或使用雇佣劳动力耕种的土地，以及为耕种土地所必需的财产。土地法允许土地所有者自由买卖和出租土地。
    土地改革将在最近三年期间，在一切新解放地区逐渐实行（在已实行土地改革的老解放区，将不再实行土改）。今年年底和一九五一年春季，将在一亿人口的地区实行土改；一九五一年冬季和一九五二年春季，将在另一有一亿七八千万人的地区实行土改。
    目前，中华人民共和国有几种经济成份存在：小商品经济——主要是农民与手工业者的经济；私人资本主义经济——以城市的中小工商业资产阶级与农村的富农为代表；国营经济——合作社属于这一范畴。
    在民主改造中国经济方面，国家起着极大的作用。国营经济逐渐扩大起来。据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领指出，国营经济具有社会主义性质，“为人民共和国发展生产、繁荣经济的主要物质基础和整个社会经济的领导力量”全国的主要财经命脉，或完全或部分地掌握在国家手中。铁路、邮电事业，属于国家所有。中国大资产阶级（买办性的）、卖国贼、汉奸、日本占领者的一切企业，以及属于前国民党政府的大银行，已被没收。
    在个别重工业部门，国营部分已占主导地位：全国煤产量的百分之七十，钢生产的百分之九十，铣铁的百分之五十，电力的百分之七十八，机器制造业的百分之七十，是由国营企业生产的。
    在老解放区，例如在东北，一九四九年工业生产总值的百分之七十四，是由国营企业生产的。新解放区，经济生活还刚刚开始上轨道，国营工业的比例还不大。在大多数轻工业部门（如造纸业、榨油业、面粉业等）中，私人资本占优势。纺织业中私人资本与国家资本所占的比例，几乎相等。由于国营工业还做不到以自己的产品完全保证对人民的供给，所以国家鼓励私人经营的积极性，给予私营工厂以定货，供给它们以原料，给予它们以贷款，并且允许私营洋行活动。
    在对内贸易方面，特别是零售贸易方面，私人资本占统治地位。国营贸易的比重，暂时还是微不足道的。对外贸易是由国家管制的，但个别企业家经政府机关特许后，可以与国外进行贸易。若干出口货的贸易，由国家垄断。例如，猪鬃的出口（中国供应世界猪鬃需要的百分之七十以上），完全掌握在国家手中。国营贸易机关在对外贸易方面所占的比重，正在逐渐提高。就一九四九年头十个月华北的对外贸易来说，国营企业所占的比例为百分之三十八，私人占百分之四十五，洋行占百分之十七。从一九五○年一月到四月，国营企业在对外贸易上所占的比例已为百分之六十五，私人占百分之二十六，洋行占百分之九。然而，总的说来，国营成份在中国经济中所占的比重仍然不大。
    随着国营工商业和信用的发展，国家对于农业的影响也日益加强，以求使农业参与民主改造中国的事业。人民政权已开始奉行农产品国家固定价格的政策，并且规定了统一的税收和贷款制度。第一批国营农场，已建立起来了。
    在使农民加入合作社的道路上，也采行了初步步骤；最简单的供销合作社与生产合作社，已建立起来了。这些合作社有助于加强城乡货物交流，巩固工农联盟。现在，农村中有合作社达三万四千个。最简单的生产合作社，已经产生，其形式即互助组——类似共同耕种土地和收割收成的组合，所联合的农民，主要是农村贫民。在互助组中，保留着土地和生产工具的私有制度。
    国家对剥削阶级的态度，是遵照人民政府的经济政策决定的。中国与中欧和东南欧的人民民主国家不同。中欧和东南欧的人民民主国家，实行了大工业与中型工业的国有化和全国的土地改革，从而消灭了资产阶级与地主的经济基础。中国目前仅仅将大资本（买办性的）收归国有，而没有将中小资产阶级的资本收归国有，因为在现阶段，国家对于吸引他们的资本，是有利害关系的。在城市，实行着限制资本主义成份的政策，在农村，实行着消灭地主土地所有制的政策。
    中国共产党为中国劳动人民开辟了到社会主义的道路。但今天，社会主义建设还不是中华人民共和国的直接任务。共产党预定了恢复和发展国民经济的计划。这一计划，必将使国家提高到人民民主制度的更高阶段，并且必将随着时间的推移而把中国过渡到社会主义发展道路的问题提上议程。关于这一点，毛泽东在政协全国委员会六月会议的闭幕词中说：
    “只要战争关、土改关都过去了，剩下的一关就将容易过去的，那就是社会主义的一关，在全国范围内实行社会主义改造的那一关。……实行工业国有化和农业社会化……还在很远的将来……在国家经济事业和文化事业大为兴盛了以后，在各种条件具备了以后，在全国人民考虑成熟并在大家同意了以后，就可以从容地和妥善地走进社会主义的新时期”。

    中国的民主建设，遭遇着内外反动派的激烈抵抗。阶级斗争在中国正在尖锐起来。资产阶级与地主分子对国家的政策不满，破坏着人民政权的措施，与人民政权进行着武装斗争。在新解放区，总共还有四十多万土匪在活动。国民党特务在美帝国主义的指使下，在进行着反共和国的破坏工作。
    中华人民共和国的存在与巩固，瓦解了美国战争挑拨者的阴谋。美国具有追求世界霸权的疯狂思想的人们，不顾美国对华政策的显然破产，还没有放弃在远东再燃起战争火焰的企图，继续干涉着中国人民的内政，打算破坏中国的民主建设。
    美国侵略者们对自己的附庸施压力，迫使它们不承认中华人民共和国，并且阻挠它加入联合国。
    美国继续支持着它的傀儡——蒋介石以及他的逃到台湾去了的溃军残余。美帝国主义者们把台湾变成了自己的殖民地。他们掠夺式地开发该岛的财富，抢劫当地人民。美国人在实行经济侵略的同时，在该岛上还加紧建造着美国的海空军基地。为此目的，美国干涉者们正在派遣自己的武装力量赴台湾。
    今年六月二十七日，美国总统下令太平洋美国第七舰队“防止对台湾的进攻”。这一命令，意味着美国对中华人民共和国的直接侵略行动，并且是事实上占领中国领土的一部分。此外，这一命令还横暴地破坏了关于台湾属于中国的开罗和波茨坦两国际协定。
    今年八月底，美国军用飞机若干架在鸭绿江地区侵犯了中华人民共和国的领空，扫射了若干地点，其中包括安东市，造成了死伤。美国武装干涉朝鲜和美国侵犯中华人民共和国的领土，证明了美国在加强对远东的帝国主义侵略。美帝国主义者们徒然地企图窒息亚洲的民族解放运动，想使中国和朝鲜两国人民再套上殖民地的羁绊。
    英国形式上承认了中华人民共和国，实际上与美国狼狈为奸。英国在联合国中的代表，和美帝国主义的其他帮凶一道，企图妨碍中国的合法代表在联合国中占有理应属于他们的地位。在美国的指使下，英帝国主义者们唆使西藏的反动派反对中国中央人民政府。西藏的面积为九十余万方公里，有人口约四百万人，乃是中国的一个组成部分。西藏人民要求制止英美集团的阴谋，使这一地区归属中华人民共和国的版图。中国中央人民政府，重申了自己要解放西藏和台湾的决心。
    中国人民对于战争挑拨者的无耻挑衅，极为愤怒。中华人民共和国政府已向安理会请求紧急审议美国空军侵入中国领土的问题，并且要求美国停止干涉中国内政，撤退台湾岛上的美国武装部队。
    苏联——全世界和平的悍卫者——支持中国为美国武装部队侵入中国领土事对联合国提出的控诉。苏联驻联合国代表团，支持中华人民共和国政府的声明，即，国民党“代表团”不代表中国，不能以中国人民的名义发言。苏联一贯无私地支持中国，引起了中国人民对其伟大邻人的感谢。
    中国与苏联及人民民主国家一道，正为全世界的和平与民主而斗争着。在中国，和平运动正在展开，在世界和大常委会和平宣言上签名运动，正积极进行中。中国人民充满了保卫和平的决心。和平对于年青的人民共和国的建设，乃是必需的。
    从中华人民共和国成立的那天到现在，仅仅过了一年，但就是这一短短的期间也表明了，从自己肩上摔掉了可恨的国民党集团及其美国主子的人民，可以取得什么成绩。中国人民的斗争，仍旧在继续中。苏联人民与全体进步人类，都怀着欣慰的心情和坚定的信心注视着这一斗争的发展，坚信伟大的中国人民在其光荣的共产党领导下，将会取得胜利。
