The United Nations General Assembly, manipulated by the American aggressors, has already passed the bloody proposal of the United Kingdom and eight other countries on October 7 to implement aggression against the entire Korean peninsula, while rejecting the just proposal of the Soviet Union and five other countries for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. This development shows that the US-UK aggression group has disregarded the peaceful efforts and repeated warnings of the Soviet Union and five other countries, the People's Republic of China, and other Asian countries, and has dangerously expanded the scope of the war of aggression in the Far East, that is to say, it has further tightened the threat of aggression against the People's Republic of China. The people of the whole country must pay serious attention to this situation.

The main content of the proposal on the issue of Korean independence jointly put forward by the delegations of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia is: First, the warring parties in Korea should immediately cease fire and withdraw the troops of the United States and other countries. Second, a committee composed of equal members of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the National Assembly of South Korea should be formed to organize and preside over the free elections of all the Korean people, and this election must be supervised by a United Nations committee with the participation of neighboring countries bordering Korea. Third, the Economic and Social Council, with the participation of Korean representatives, should promptly formulate and adopt a plan to provide the necessary economic and technical assistance to Korea through the United Nations to help restore the national economy destroyed by the war. Fourth, after the establishment of the government of the entire Korean peninsula, the Security Council will review the issue of admitting Korea to the United Nations. Obviously, this proposal can truly peacefully resolve the Korean issue, is reasonable, fair and selfless, and is in line with the wishes and interests of the Korean people and the people of the world. If this proposal is adopted and implemented, peace in Korea can be restored immediately, and the situation in the Far East can be eased immediately. Because, according to the content of the proposal, one is to immediately cease fire and withdraw the troops of the United States and other countries. In this way, not only will the flames of war in Korea be extinguished immediately, but also the root cause of the Korean War will be eliminated. The second is to have North and South Korea elect equal representatives to organize and preside over the free elections of the entire Korean peninsula, and the United Nations committee with the participation of representatives of countries bordering Korea will supervise its conduct. Democratic and free elections can be expected to be realized, and the government of the entire Korean peninsula produced in this way can be expected to be supported by the people. Thus, it can also be expected to smoothly carry out the work of restoring war wounds with the help of the United Nations, so that the people of the entire Korean peninsula can quickly restore a peaceful life. Because of all this, the Chinese people, who are closely concerned about peace in the Far East, firmly support this just proposal.

However, the United Nations General Assembly rejected this proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue under the American-manipulated voting machine, and passed a proposal, obviously directed by the United States, put forward by the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, Cuba, the Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, and the Philippines, which aims to prolong the war and expand aggression.

The proposal of the United Kingdom and eight other countries violates the will of the Korean and world people, violates the interests of Far Eastern peace that the Chinese people are closely concerned about, and serves only the American imperialist war of aggression. The main content of this proposal is: First, the US military should ensure "the stability of the entire Korean situation" and "hold elections under the supervision of the United Nations" in Korea to "unify" Korea; second, to organize a "United Nations Unified Reconstruction Committee for Korea" to replace the "United Nations Commission on Korea" to carry out the work of covering up the United States' enslavement and aggression against Korea; third, before this committee arrives in Korea, the countries participating in the committee should organize a temporary committee to consult with the "United Nations Unified Command" and provide advice to the command. The commander of the United Nations Command is MacArthur, the chief culprit in the aggression against Korea, that is to say, the committee must listen to the command of the United States.

According to this proposal, the US military will not only not withdraw from Korea, but also continue to carry out the war of aggression until "the situation in the entire Korean peninsula is stable." After the so-called "stable situation" established by the invaders, the US military will have to wait until the end of the "free elections" before talking about the withdrawal issue. This means that the US aggressor army vainly attempts to occupy the entire Korean peninsula in the name of the United Nations, and savagely massacre the patriotic people of the entire Korean peninsula in the name of the United Nations, and establish a reign of terror that the Korean people will resolutely resist in the name of the United Nations. From this, it can be seen that the proposal of the United Kingdom and eight other countries is not at all for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, but to make the entire Korean peninsula a pool of blood of free people under American bombs and bayonets, and to become a land, sea and air military base for aggression against the People's Republic of China.

Although the United Nations General Assembly passed the proposal of the United Kingdom and eight other countries due to the majority manipulated by the United States, this "resolution," like the previous "resolutions" passed by the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations Political and Security Committee on Korea, is illegal. These "resolutions" directly violate the fundamental principle of the United Nations Charter of non-interference in the internal affairs of countries. Moreover, the United Nations General Assembly only invited representatives of the Syngman Rhee group to participate when discussing the agenda related to the Korean issue, while refusing to invite representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to attend, which is also illegal. This is to only allow the American agents to speak, but not allow the Korean people to speak, which is a direct violation of the provisions of the United Nations Rules of Procedure regarding inviting both parties to a dispute to state their opinions. This illegal "resolution" can never be recognized by the Korean people and the people of all countries in the world.

Now the facts are very clear. Despite the efforts of the Soviet Union, China and other peace-loving countries to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and to save peace, American imperialism and its accomplices stubbornly insist on expanding the war. The imperialist aggression group that manipulates the United Nations General Assembly so brazenly passed such an illegal "resolution" to expand aggression on October 7, of course, dreaming that the executioners can do whatever they want in Korea. But the executioners should not be too happy too early. Although the Korean People's Army withdrew from Seoul and other cities in the face of a superior enemy, the main force of the Korean People's Army still exists, still resolutely and bravely resisting the aggressors, and preparing to annihilate the enemy at the appropriate time and place. As Premier Zhou Enlai said in his report on September 30: "The Korean people, adhering to the policy of protracted resistance, will surely overcome many difficulties and achieve final victory." Premier Zhou Enlai's report also said: "The Chinese people will never tolerate foreign aggression, nor can they allow the imperialists to carry out aggression against their neighbors with impunity. ... Whoever obliterates and undermines the interests of this quarter of humanity and vainly attempts to unilaterally solve any Eastern problems directly related to China, then whoever will surely be bruised and battered." Regarding the situation in Korea, China's neighbor, the Chinese people have long announced their position. The 475 million Chinese people, like the peace-loving and just people of all countries in the world, resolutely advocate an immediate end to the Korean War, the immediate withdrawal of the United States and other foreign troops from Korea, resolutely oppose the aggressive "resolution" of the aggression group in the United Nations General Assembly, and resolutely believe that the aggressors must be responsible for the consequences of all their crazy actions to expand aggression.

### 坚决反对侵略集团对朝鲜问题的非法《决议》

　　坚决反对侵略集团对朝鲜问题的非法《决议》
    在美国侵略者操纵下的联合国大会，已经在十月七日通过了英国等八国关于对全朝鲜实行侵略的血腥提案，而否决了苏联等五国关于和平解决朝鲜问题的公正提案。这个发展，表明美英侵略集团已经不顾苏联等五国、中华人民共和国和其他亚洲国家的和平努力和再三警告，把在远东的侵略战争的范围危险地扩大了，也就是说，把对于中华人民共和国的侵略威胁进一步逼紧了。全国人民必须严重地注意这个形势。
    苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰及捷克斯洛伐克五国代表团所联合提出的关于朝鲜独立问题的提案的主要内容是：第一，在朝鲜的交战双方立刻停战并撤退美国及其他国家的军队。第二，由朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议及南朝鲜国民议会同等议员组成委员会，以组织和主持全体朝鲜人民的自由选举事宜，这一选举并须由有与朝鲜接壤的邻国参加的联合国委员会监督进行。第三，经社理事会在朝鲜代表参加下，迅速拟订通过联合国和必要的经济与技术援助给朝鲜以帮助的计划，以便恢复遭到战争破坏的国民经济。第四，在全朝鲜政府成立以后，安理会审查准许朝鲜加入联合国组织的问题。很明显，这一提案是真能和平解决朝鲜问题的，是合情合理、公正无私的，是符合朝鲜人民及全世界人民的愿望和利益的。如果这个提案被通过并实行了，则朝鲜的和平立刻可以恢复，远东的形势立刻可以和缓。因为，按照提案的内容，其一是立刻停战并撤退美国及其他国家的军队，这样一来，不但立即扑灭了朝鲜境内的战火，而且也消灭了朝鲜战争的根源。其二是由南北朝鲜选出同等的代表来组织与主持全朝鲜的自由选举，并由与朝鲜接壤的国家代表参加的联合国委员会监督其进行，则民主自由的选举可望实现，而用这种方法产生的全朝鲜政府可望得到人民的拥护，从而也可望在联合国组织帮助下，顺利地进行恢复战争创伤的工作，使全朝鲜人民迅速恢复和平的生活。由于这一切，密切关心远东和平的中国人民，坚决支持这个正义的提案。
    然而，联合国大会却在美国操纵的表决机器下否决了这个和平解决朝鲜问题的提案，而通过了显然是由美国指使的由英国、澳大利亚、巴西、古巴、荷兰、挪威、巴基斯坦及菲律宾所提出的旨在延长战争和扩大侵略的提案。
    英国等八国的提案是违反朝鲜和全世界人民的意志，违反中国人民所密切关心的远东和平的利益，而仅仅为美国帝国主义侵略战争服务的。这个提案的主要内容就是：第一，美国军队应当在朝鲜保证“整个朝鲜的情势稳定”和“在联合国的监督下举行选举”以“统一”朝鲜；第二，要组织“联合国统一复兴朝鲜委员会”，代替“联合国朝鲜委员会”，以进行掩护美国奴役和侵略朝鲜的工作；第三，在这一委员会到达朝鲜前，参加该委员会的各国应组织临时委员会，与“联合国统一司令部”商协，并向该司令部提供意见。而联合国司令部的司令就是侵略朝鲜的元凶麦克阿瑟，也就是说该委员会要听从美国的指挥。
    依照这一提案，美国军队不但不撤离朝鲜，而且还要继续进行侵略战争，直到“整个朝鲜的情势稳定”时为止。而在侵略者所谓“稳定的情势”建立以后，美国军队还要等到“自由选举”结束后才谈到撤退的问题，这就意味着美国侵略军妄想假联合国之名占领全部朝鲜，并且假联合国之名野蛮地屠杀全朝鲜的爱国人民，假联合国之名建立为朝鲜人民所决死反抗的恐怖统治。由此可见，英国等八国的提案完全不是为了和平解决朝鲜问题，而是要使整个朝鲜在美国炸弹和刺刀下成为自由人民的血泊，成为指向中华人民共和国的陆海空军侵略基地。
    联合国大会虽然由于美国操纵着多数通过了英国等八国的提案，但是这个《决议》，和前此联合国安全理事会和联合国政治与安全委员会所通过的有关朝鲜的《决议》一样，都是非法的。这些《决议》直接违背联合国宪章不干涉各国内政的根本原则。而且，联合国大会在讨论有关朝鲜问题的议程时，仅仅邀请李承晚集团的代表参加，而拒绝邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表出席，这也是非法的。这就是只准许美国代理人发言，而不许朝鲜人民发言，这是直接违反联合国议事规则关于邀请争端双方陈述意见的规定的。这种非法的《决议》，决不能为朝鲜人民和世界各国人民所承认。
    现在事实是十分清楚了。尽管苏联、中国和其他爱好和平的国家努力于和平解决朝鲜问题，努力于挽救和平，美国帝国主义及其帮凶却死硬地坚持扩大战争。操纵着联合国大会的帝国主义侵略集团所以在十月七日悍然通过这样的扩大侵略的非法《决议》，当然是梦想刽子手们可以在朝鲜为所欲为。但是刽子手们不要高兴得太早了。朝鲜人民军虽然在优势的敌人面前撤出了汉城和其他的一些城市，但是朝鲜人民军的主力仍然存在着，仍然坚决地英勇地抵抗着侵略者，并且准备着在适当的时机和地点歼灭敌人。正如周恩来总理在九月三十日的报告中所说：“朝鲜人民在坚持长期抗战的方针下，必能克服许多困难，取得最后胜利。”周恩来总理的报告又说：“中国人民决不能容忍外国的侵略，也不能听任帝国主义者对自己的邻人肆行侵略而置之不理。……谁要是抹煞和破坏这四分之一人类的利益而妄想独断地解决与中国有直接关系的任何东方问题，那么，谁就一定要碰得头破血流。”对于中国邻邦朝鲜的形势，中国人民早已宣布了自己的立场。四万七千五百万的中国人民，和爱好和平正义的世界各国人民一样，坚决地主张立即停止朝鲜战争，立即由朝鲜撤退美国和其他外国军队，坚决地反对联合国大会上的侵略集团的侵略性的《决议》，而且坚决地认定侵略者们必须对于自己的一切扩大侵略的疯狂行为的后果负责。
