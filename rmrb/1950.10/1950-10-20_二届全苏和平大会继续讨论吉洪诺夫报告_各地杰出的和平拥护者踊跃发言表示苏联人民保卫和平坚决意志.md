Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 17th (TASS dispatch): The Second All-Soviet Conference for the Defense of Peace, held in Moscow, convened on the morning of the 17th to continue the discussion of the report by Nikolai Tikhonov, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee, on "The Soviet People's Struggle for Peace Against the Instigators of a New War."

"The Soviet people understand the value of peace because they have undergone severe trials."
——Belarusian Poet Brovka

The first speaker was Belarusian poet Brovka, who said: The Soviet people are fervently fighting for peace, and all good people around the world are advancing alongside the Soviet people in this great struggle. The Soviet people understand the value of peace because no one has undergone such severe trials as they have. During the war, Soviet Belarus was the first to be hit by the treacherous enemy. Her sons and daughters fought heroically in the ranks of the army and guerrilla forces. Since the end of the war, the people of Belarus have successfully restored the economy of their republic. Our hearts are filled with joy because many machines made in Belarus are being sent to the banks of the Volga, Dnieper, and Amu Darya rivers for the construction of huge communist construction projects.
The Belarusian people, who once fought heroically against the Hitlerite bandits, now stand united under the banner of struggle for world peace.

"We are confident in our future, we deeply know our strength."
——Georgian People's Artist Khorava

Georgian representative, People's Artist Khorava, said: Our Soviet peace conference, with its unprecedented number of attendees, represents the voices of two hundred million Soviet people. Hundreds of millions of ordinary people in countries around the world are listening intently to every word we say. The issues we are discussing today at our peace conference inspire all upright people around the world. We are all filled with a firm desire to build, create, and work towards overcoming all difficulties and establishing the edifice of communism. We have never brandished weapons or coveted other people's property. In our news, art, agitation, and propaganda work, there has never been the slightest call for aggression. But when we were forced to take up arms in 1941, the Soviet people showed what they were capable of doing in defending their homeland. We contribute to the cause of peace by selflessly dedicating all our strength and talent to creating a happy and peaceful life. This is the will of our hundreds of millions of people. The government of our country, led by the great Stalin, sacredly carries out this will.
We Soviet people are the vanguard of the greatest movement of our time. We are proud to bear a significant responsibility in this struggle for the happiness of mankind. We are confident in our future, we deeply know our strength. We are launching the struggle to defend world peace in the name of our beloved Stalin, and we will surely win this struggle.

"We will block the road to war, and we will surely achieve lasting world peace."
——Famous Female Weaver Ananyeva

Soviet famous female weaver Ananyeva stated in her speech: Each of us understands the great significance of this conference. We Soviet people have come here to declare to the world that we will block the road to war, and we will surely achieve lasting world peace. Nothing is better than our peaceful work, nothing is more beautiful than our Soviet life. When I think of the rulers of the United States and Britain threatening our happiness, my heart is filled with anger and a firm determination to dedicate all my strength to the cause of peace. During my visits to Poland, Hungary, and Romania, I personally witnessed the firm determination of their people to defend peace. Our foreign brothers and sisters strengthened the cause of peace with their labor achievements. In Lodz, Bucharest, and Budapest, I reported to my fellow weavers on the work of Soviet Stakhanovite workers, and I was truly gratified to see that my working methods were also useful to them. From this podium, I extend Stakhanovite greetings, greetings of peace, to them.

"A true scientist must be an active peace fighter"
——Ukrainian Academy of Sciences President Baradin

Ukrainian Academy of Sciences President Baradin said: The working people of Soviet Ukraine entrusted us to declare: The Ukrainian people need peace and believe that defending peace is a cause that is of vital interest to them. The Ukrainian people unanimously support the peace-loving policies of the Soviet government, and they will continue to strengthen the strength of their beloved motherland with selfless labor.

The large-scale communist construction projects reflect the Soviet government's peace-loving policies and its calm and profound confidence in our country's strength. Only the Soviet people can prescribe and solve the epoch-making task of improving nature for the benefit of the working people of the world. The Soviet example inspires the working people of the people's democratic countries. Romania is building a canal from the Danube to the Black Sea; Bulgaria is building high dams to protect farmers' fields from the waters of the Danube; Poland's swamps are being filled in. All of this is a plan for life, a plan for peacefully transforming nature for the benefit of the working people of the world. The imperialist war instigators, however, hold the opposite plan, a vicious death plan, a malicious plan to eliminate humanity. They have already begun to implement these plans in Korea.

Baradin continued: Every honest person can see what these two camps are doing and what their plans are. On the one hand is the plan of the camp of life; on the other hand is the plan of the camp of death. On the one hand is the camp of peace, socialism, and democracy; on the other hand is the camp of imperialism, the camp of war. There is no doubt that all honest people will choose life and will actively participate in the struggle for peace.

Referring to the situation of scientists fighting for peace, Baradin stated: Currently, all our thoughts are focused on giving the greatest possible scientific assistance to the great plan of communism. A true scientist must be an active peace fighter because science must serve the purpose of creation, not the purpose of destruction. Only the great purpose of mankind can inspire scientists' immense creative enthusiasm.

"Cooperators worldwide strengthen the struggle against the instigators of a new war!"
——Klimov, Vice-Chairman of the Central Union of Consumer Cooperatives of the Soviet Union

Klimov, Vice-Chairman of the Central Union of Consumer Cooperatives of the Soviet Union, delivered a welcoming speech to the conference on behalf of the workers of the All-Soviet Consumer Cooperatives. He said: The Soviet Consumer Cooperatives, in the international unity of the cooperative movement, in joint actions taken with the trade unions united in the World Federation of Trade Unions, are resolute and consistent fighters in the struggle for world peace and for defending the social and economic rights of the working people. The Soviet cooperative workers, who are developing friendly relations with foreign cooperative workers, call on all honest cooperative workers around the world to strengthen the struggle against the instigators of a new war.

Siberian People Firmly Protest Against US Imperialist Aggression in Korea
——Miner Baralaev

Miner Baralaev conveyed the congratulations of the miners of the Kuznetsk Coal Basin. He said: When we signed the peace declaration, we guaranteed a large increase in coal production. The words of the miners are stronger than rock. The miners of our pit have already produced one hundred trainloads of coal above the plan. This is the power exerted by the miners of our one pit alone in signing the peace declaration. The representatives and guests applauded this statement by the representatives of the Soviet working class warmly. Baralaev continued: Today, my comrades are working to contribute another thirty trainloads of coal above the plan to the 33rd anniversary of the Great October Revolution, and they guarantee to complete the year's plan no later than December 5th—Constitution Day of Stalin. This is what the Siberian people are doing today. The Siberian people express angry and resolute protests against the American bandits' attack on the peace-loving Korean people. Why does the United Nations Organization not stop these criminals? We ordinary Soviet people believe that many countries in the United Nations General Assembly that voted to justify the aggression against Korea have been forever disgraced.

"We call on Catholics worldwide to support the heroic struggle of the Korean people!"
——Father Stankevichius of the Priests' Society

Father Stankevichius of the Priests' Society, representing the Catholics of the Estonian Republic, declared: We condemn those who are preparing for war. We call on Catholics worldwide to resolutely support the heroic struggle of the Korean people for freedom and independence against the Anglo-American aggressors. We demand an immediate end to the bloodshed. We Estonian Catholics participate within the peace advocates throughout the world. We call on all believers to condemn those who violate religious morality in action and commit crimes against all mankind; we call on believers worldwide to unite and wage a common struggle against the warmongers in support of peace.

"Soviet schools are schools of peace, cultivating kindness and justice in the hearts of children. American schools, however, cultivate pilots who kill Korean children!"
——Retired Teacher Martiyanova

Soviet retired teacher Martiyanova stated in her speech: Soviet schools educate people who will build for a happy and beautiful life, for a life of peace and labor. Soviet schools are schools of peace. They cultivate noble feelings and thoughts, kindness and justice, respect for the freedom and independence of every nation, and love for their motherland in the hearts of children. She indignantly spoke of the methods of educating children in capitalist countries. She said: In the United States, they destroy children's minds, instilling in them barbaric ethics, “concepts” of racial superiority, brutal bestiality, and egoism. We have already seen the results of this education. Many of those American pilots who are now bombing and staining the land of Korea with blood were still primary school students not long ago. Now, they are turning Korean schools into ruins, throwing bombs at Korean children's schoolhouses. These American pilots, who themselves once sat in classrooms taking lessons, are now persecuting women holding babies along the roads in Korea, strafing primary school students returning home from school, and children playing near their homes with machine guns. Martiyanova continued: I want to ask the American teachers from this podium, to question the teachers who taught these demons: Don't you feel ashamed that you taught these students? Don't you feel ashamed that they committed these crimes? Don't you feel ashamed of yourselves? Soviet school children often ask us teachers about the situation in Korea. They say: "We know why the Korean People's Army is fighting. It is fighting for the happiness of children, for the future of children, so that they can all study in primary school, middle school, and even university, so that the Korean people can become the masters of their motherland, the masters of their destiny." "But, tell us," they asked: "What are the American soldiers fighting for? What purpose are they fighting against the peaceful Korean people for?" This question arises in the hearts of all working people, and all people in all countries ask the American aggressors this question. Let the American aggressors answer this question to the world court, to the court of justice and honor, to the court of all peoples.

"The Estonian people shout with the people of the world: 'No interference in Korea!'"
——Eichfeld, President of the Estonian Academy of Sciences

Eichfeld, President of the Estonian Academy of Sciences, eloquently described the achievements made by the Estonian Republic: I am speaking of these achievements in order to show that the shameless arbitrary claims of the Wall Street running dogs who refuse to recognize the Soviet Baltic republics are clearly untenable. The working people of Estonia do not need this kind of recognition at all, because the vitality of the Soviet system has been proven by life itself, and no one can plunder the fruits acquired by the Estonian people. The working people of Estonia place a very high value on the possibility of free labor. They are increasingly aware of how great and amazing prospects the Soviet system has opened up. They want peace, and they hate war. They are prepared to fight with all their strength against the instigators of war, and they are prepared to defend the advantageous position that has been opened up to them, to defend the advantageous position that our young republic enjoys in the large family of Soviet peoples with equal rights. The working people of Estonia, together with all the peoples of the Soviet Union, send out a majestic cry: "No interference in Korea!" "Down with the despicable war instigators!" "Long live the peace fighters of the world!"

"We, mothers! Hate war, we defend our children—peace!"
——Russian Mother Nemova

The conference representatives warmly welcomed Nemova, a Russian mother who had raised twenty-six children. She said: When I was preparing to attend this conference, my grandsons and granddaughters, my sons and daughters, and my daughters-in-law all said to me: "Please speak for all of us, mother." Here I see the multi-ethnic family of all the peoples of our country. Millions of people of the motherland stand by my side and issue a demand: Speak up! We have no right to remain silent. My heart is filled with immense sorrow, and my heart burns with contempt and anger at the American murderers. Curse these demons among men! They cannot oppress the freedom-loving Korean people, they cannot break the will of the peoples of all countries for peace, they cannot throw peace into prisons and concentration camps. They cannot turn blood into gold. This is something that will never happen. Nemova said: We, mothers, hate war, we defend our children—peace. We warm it with our breath, with our peaceful labor, and if necessary, we will defend peace with our lives, resisting the enemy. I want to express the gratitude of mothers to the Soviet Peace Committee, thank it for the work it has done, and thank it for the correct direction it has taken, which has won the sympathy of people around the world.

The famous Soviet historian, Academician Tarle, spoke specifically about the Korean situation. He analyzed in detail the essence of the American aggression against Korea.

Kosmodemyanskaya, member of the Soviet Peace Committee and mother of Danya, said: The forces of peace, consolidated in a united front, are an invincible force. Long live all honest people in the world who defend peace!

Speakers at this morning's meeting also included: Lathe worker Pochiptsov, Azerbaijani Republic outstanding social figure Aliyeva, Russian Federation Meritorious Physician Rumiyanchaev, Latvian female writer Sax, famous locomotive driver of the Northern Donets Railway Shumilov, Turkmen writer Keirbabayev, composer Khrennikov, and Lithuanian Academy of Sciences President Matulis, and others.

　　二届全苏和平大会继续讨论吉洪诺夫报告
    各地杰出的和平拥护者踊跃发言表示苏联人民保卫和平坚决意志
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十七日电，在莫斯科举行的第二届全苏拥护和平大会于十七日上午举行会议，继续讨论苏联拥护和平委员会主席吉洪诺夫关于“苏联人民为争取和平反对新战争挑拨者而斗争”的报告。
    “苏联人民了解和平的价值，因为他们经过严酷的考验。”
    ——白俄罗斯诗人布罗夫卡
    第一个发言者为白俄罗斯诗人布罗夫卡，他说：苏联人民在为和平而热烈地奋斗，全世界一切善良的人民和苏联人民并肩在这个伟大的斗争中一道前进。苏联人民了解和平的价值，因为谁也没有象他们这样经过严酷的考验。在战争的日子里，苏维埃白俄罗斯首先遭到奸诈敌人的打击。她的儿女们曾在军队和游击队的队伍中英勇地作战。自战争结束以来，白俄罗斯的人民已经顺利地恢复了他们共和国的经济。我们的心中充满了愉快，因为白俄罗斯制造的许多机器正纷纷送往伏尔加河、第聂伯河和阿姆河沿岸去，以供巨大的共产主义建设计划的建筑工程应用。
    曾经对希特勒匪帮英勇作战的白俄罗斯人民现在象一个人似的站在为世界和平而斗争的旗帜之下。
    “我们确信我们的未来，我们深知我们的力量。”
    ——乔治亚人民演员霍拉瓦
    乔治亚代表、人民演员霍拉瓦说：我们苏联的这个和平大会，会众之多是闻所未闻的。我们是两亿苏联人民的发言人。世界各国的亿万普通人民都在静听我们所说的每一句话。我们今天在我们这个拥护和平大会上所讨论的问题使全世界一切正直的人民奋发起来。我们全都满怀着坚定的愿望，要为克服一切困难、为建立共产主义的大厦而建设、而创造、而工作。我们从未拿着武器耀武扬威，从未垂涎别人的财产。在我国的新闻、艺术、鼓动与宣传工作方面，从未有过丝毫的侵略的号召。但是当我们在一九四一年被迫拿起武器的时候，苏联人民表明了他们在保卫祖国时能够做出什么事情来。我们不顾牺牲地把我们的全部力量与才能用来创造幸福的和平生活，因而对于和平的事业有所贡献。这就是我国亿万人民的意志。由伟大的斯大林领导的我国政府神圣地执行着这种意志。
    我们苏维埃人民是我们这时代最伟大的运动的先锋。我们因为在这个为了人类的幸福的斗争中担负重大的责任而引以为荣。我们确信我们的未来，我们深知我们的力量。我们用敬爱的斯大林的名义而发动保卫世界和平的斗争，而且我们必将赢得这个斗争。
    “我们要堵塞走向战争的道路，我们必将获得全世界的持久和平。”
    ——著名女织主安娜尼耶娃
    苏联著名女织工安娜尼耶娃演说称：我们每一个人都理解这个大会的伟大意义。我们苏维埃人民来到这里向全世界宣称，我们要堵塞走向战争的道路，我们必将获得全世界的持久和平。没有东西比我们的和平工作更好，没有东西比我们苏维埃的生活更美。当我一想到美英统治者威胁我们的幸福的时候，我的心里就充满了愤怒与坚定的决心，要把我全部的力量贡献给和平的事业。在我访问波兰、匈牙利和罗马尼亚的时候，我亲眼看到了它们的人民保卫和平的坚定决心。我们外国的兄弟姊妹们用劳动的功绩加强了和平的事业。在罗兹、布加勒斯特和布达佩斯，我曾把苏联斯塔哈诺夫式工作者工作的情形报告给我的织工同志们，我看到我的工作方法对于他们也有用，我真感到快慰。在这个讲坛上，我向他们致斯塔哈诺夫的敬礼，和平的敬礼。
    “真正的科学家必然是积极的和平战士”
    ——乌克兰科学院长巴拉丁
    乌克兰科学院院长巴拉丁说：苏维埃乌克兰的劳动人民委托我们宣称：乌克兰人民需要和平并且认为保卫和平是他们自己具有切身利害关系的事业，乌克兰人民一致拥护苏联政府的爱好和平的政策，他们将继续以忘我的劳动来加强他们深爱的祖国的实力。
    规模宏大的共产主义建设计划，反映出苏联政府爱好和平的政策以及对我国力量之沉着而深切的信心。只有苏联人民才可以为了世界劳动人民的福利而规定和解决了改善自然的划时代的任务。苏联的榜样鼓舞了各人民民主国家的劳动人民。罗马尼亚正在建造从多瑙河到黑海的运河；保加利亚建造高水闸，保护农民的田地去防御多瑙河的水；波兰的沼地正在填筑中。所有这一切都是为了生活的计划，都是为世界劳动人民的福利而在和平地改造自然的计划。帝国主义的战争煽动者们却抱着相反的计划，凶暴的死亡计划，恶毒的消灭人类的计划。他们在朝鲜已经开始实行这些计划了。
    巴拉丁继称：每一个诚实人都可以看到这两个阵营正在做什么，它们的计划是什么。一方面是生活的阵营的计划；一方面是死亡的阵营的计划。一方面是和平，社会主义，和民主的阵营；一方面是帝国主义的阵营，战争的阵营。没有疑问，所有诚实人民都会选择生活，都会积极参加为和平而进行的斗争。
    巴拉丁论及科学家们为和平而斗争的情形时称：在目前，我们一切的思想都集中在给与共产主义的伟大计划以最大限度的科学帮助上面。真正的科学家必然是积极的和平战士，因为科学必须服务于创造的目的，而不服务于破坏的目的。只有人类的伟大目的，才可以鼓舞科学家们创造的巨大的热诚。
    “全世界一切诚实的合作社工作者加强对新战争挑拨者的斗争！”
    ——全苏消费合作社中央联合会副主席克里莫夫
    全苏消费合作社中央联合会副主席克里莫夫代表全苏消费合作社工作者向大会致欢迎辞。他说：苏联消费合作社，在为合作社运动的国际团结中，在与团结在世界工联内的各工会采取的共同行动中，在为世界和平和为保卫劳动人民的社会与经济权利而进行的斗争中，是坚决而一贯的战士们。和各外国合作社工作者们发展着友好关系的苏联合作社工作者们，号召全世界一切诚实的合作社工作者们加强对新战争煽动者们的斗争。
    西伯利亚人民坚决抗议美帝侵略朝鲜
    ——矿工巴拉莱也夫
    矿工巴拉莱也夫传达库兹涅次克煤矿盆地矿工们的祝贺。他说：我们在和平宣言上签名时保证大量增加煤炭的产量。矿工们的话比岩石还要坚固些。我们矿坑的矿工们已经超计划地生产了一百辆列车的煤。这是单独我们一座矿坑的矿工们在和平宣言上的签名所发挥的力量。各代表们和各来宾们对苏联工人阶级代表的这一项声明报以热烈的喝采。巴拉莱也夫继称：现今我的同志们正在工作，他们要在伟大十月革命第三十三周年纪念日再超计划地献出三十辆列车的煤炭，他们并且保证不迟于十二月五日——斯大林宪法纪念日完成一年的计划。这便是西伯利亚人民在今天所做的事情。西伯利亚人民对美国强盗们进攻爱好和平的朝鲜人民表示愤怒而坚决的抗议。为什么联合国组织不制止这些罪犯们呢？我们普通苏联人民认为：在联合国大会中投票赞成侵略朝鲜为合理的许多国家，已经永远地蒙上耻辱了。
    “我们号召全世界天主教徒拥护朝鲜人民的英勇斗争！”
    ——神父会神父史丹凯维丘斯
    神父会的神父史丹凯维丘斯，代表爱沙尼亚共和国的天主教徒们宣称：我们谴责那些准备战争的人们。我们号召全世界天主教徒们坚决拥护朝鲜人民为自由和独立对美英侵略者们进行的英勇斗争。我们要求立刻停止流血。我们爱沙尼亚的天主教徒们参加在全世界的和平拥护者里面。我们号召所有教徒们谴责那些在行动上违反宗教道德对全人类实施罪行的人们；我们号召全世界信徒们团结起来，为了拥护和平对战争贩子们进行共同的斗争。
    “苏联学校是和平的学校，在儿童的心中培养仁爱与公正。美国学校却培养出杀害朝鲜儿童的飞行员！”
    ——退休教员马尔提扬诺娃
    苏联退休的教员马尔提扬诺娃演说称：苏联学校教育出将来为幸福而美好的生活、为和平与劳动的生活而建设的人们。苏联学校是和平的学校。它们在儿童的心中培养崇高的感情和思想，仁爱和公正，对每一民族的自由和独立的尊敬以及对他们祖国的热爱。她愤慨地谈起了资本主义国家中教养儿童的方法。她说：在美国，他们摧残儿童的心灵，向他们灌输野蛮的伦理、种族优越的“观念”、残忍的兽性和利己主义。我们已经看到这种教育的结果了。现在滥炸着、血染着朝鲜的国土的那些美国飞行员们之中，有许多人在不久以前还是小学生呢。现在，他们竟使朝鲜学校变成废墟，向朝鲜儿童们的校舍投弹了。这些美国飞行员们，自己也曾坐在教室里上过课，现在竟在朝鲜沿途迫害怀抱着婴孩的妇女们，用机关枪扫射那些放学回家的小学生们，以及在家庭附近游戏的孩子们了。马尔提扬诺娃继称：我要从这个讲坛上，质问美国的教师们，质问给这些恶魔上过课的教师们：你们教出这些学生来，你们不觉得羞耻吗？他们犯了这些罪行，你们不觉得羞耻吗？你们难道不觉得你们自己可耻吗？苏联的学校儿童们常常向我们这些教师们问起了朝鲜的局势。他们说：“我们知道朝鲜人民军是为何而战。它是为儿童的幸福而战，为儿童的将来而战，使他们都能够在小学、中学、以至大学求学，使朝鲜人民成为他们的祖国的主人，成为他们的命运的主人”。“但是，告诉我们罢，”他们发问道：“美国士兵们是为何而战呢，他们对和平的朝鲜人民打仗是为了什么目的呢？”一切劳动人民的心中都发生这样的问题，所有各国的老百姓都向美国侵略者们提出这样的质问。叫美国侵略者们向世界法庭、向公正与荣誉的法庭，向各族人民的法庭，来回答这个问题罢。
    “爱沙尼亚人民同世界人民一起高呼：‘不准干涉朝鲜！’”
    ——爱沙尼亚科学院长爱奇菲尔德
    爱沙尼亚科学院院长爱奇菲尔德，畅述爱沙尼亚共和国所获得的成就称：我谈起这些成就，是为了要表明那些不肯承认苏维埃波罗的海各共和国的华尔街走狗们厚颜无耻的武断是显然不能成立的。爱沙尼亚的劳动人民根本不需要这一种承认，因为苏维埃制度的活力已由生活本身证明了，而且没有一个人能够掠夺爱沙尼亚人民所获得的成果。爱沙尼亚的劳动人民对自由劳动的可能性评价极高。他们日益觉悟到苏维埃制度开拓出多么伟大惊人的前途。他们要和平，他们痛恨战争。他们准备以全部力量为反对战争煽动者而斗争，准备保卫已在他们面前开拓出来的有利的地位，保卫我们年青的共和国以同等的权利在苏联各族人民的大家庭中享有的那种有利地位。爱沙尼亚劳动人民与全苏联各族人民一同发出雄壮的呼声：“不准干涉朝鲜！”“打倒卑劣的战争煽动者们！”“全世界和平斗士们万岁！”
    “我们，母亲们！痛恨战争，我们保卫我们的孩子—和平！”
    ——俄罗斯母亲聂莫娃
    大会代表们热烈欢迎一个俄罗斯母亲，曾养育了二十六个儿女的聂莫娃。她说：我准备来出席这次大会的时候，我的孙子和孙女儿、我的儿子和女儿，以及我的媳妇们都对我说：“请去为我们大家发言罢，母亲。”在这儿我看到了我国各族人民的多民族大家庭。祖国的千百万人民站在我身边，发出要求：说呀！我们没有权利保持缄默，我的心中万分悲痛，我的心中燃烧着对美国杀人犯的蔑视和愤怒。咒诅这些人间的恶魔罢！他们不能压迫爱好自由的朝鲜人民，他们不能打破各国人民对和平的意志，他们不能把和平投入牢狱和集中营。他们不能把鲜血炼成黄金。这是永远不会发生的事情。聂莫娃说：我们，母亲们，痛恨战争，我们保卫我们的孩子——和平。我们用我们的气息，用我们的和平劳动，使它温暖，必要的时候，我们当用我们的生命来保卫和平，抵御敌人。我要向苏联和平委员会表示母亲们的感激，感谢它已完成的工作，感谢它依照正确的方针，已博得全世界人民的同情。
    著名的苏联历史学家，科学院院士塔尔列发言时特别谈论了朝鲜局势。他详细分析了美国侵略朝鲜的实质。
    苏联和平委员会委员、丹娘的母亲考斯莫杰米扬斯卡雅说：在联合阵线中巩固起来的和平力量是不可征服的力量。全世界保卫和平的一切正直的人民万岁！
    在今天上午会议上发言的还有：旋盘工人波契普左夫、阿塞拜疆共和国卓越的社会名流阿利耶娃、俄罗斯联邦功勋医师鲁密阳柴夫、拉脱维亚女作家萨克斯、北顿尼兹铁路的著名机车司机舒米洛夫、土库曼作家凯尔巴巴耶夫、作曲家赫连尼科夫和立陶宛科学院院长马图利斯等人。
