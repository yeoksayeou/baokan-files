Shulu County Appropriately Adjusts Unreasonable Cotton Price Differences
　　Unifying Control of Flower Prices to Purchase New Cotton
[Our Newspaper's Report] This spring, Shulu County, Hebei Province, mobilized the masses to plant cotton extensively, and it is estimated that the county's total output of seed cotton this autumn will reach 30 million jin, an increase of more than 17.7 million jin compared to last year. In early September, new cotton was put on the market in large quantities, and the volume and trading activity in various markets were unprecedented in the past decade.

When the county started purchasing cotton, there was no unified control, and there was a lack of coordination between the relevant departments. The trade departments did not strictly inspect the market, resulting in significant differences in cotton prices across various regions. For example, on September 6th, at the Xiaozhang Village market in the Second District, top-quality seed cotton was priced at 265,000 yuan per hundred jin, while second-quality cotton was 254,000 yuan. On September 7th, at the Wangshankou Village market (ten miles from Xiaozhang Village), top-quality seed cotton was only 230,000 yuan per hundred jin, and second-quality cotton was 220,000 yuan, which further dropped to 200,000 yuan in the afternoon (the company price did not fall). Other markets also had differences on the same day and at the same time. The price of ginned cotton was much higher than that of seed cotton. Merchants who bought seed cotton and ginned it could earn 100,000 yuan per hundred jin, which was an excessive profit. The large difference in cotton prices caused losses to some cotton farmers and state-owned enterprises, and facilitated some speculative merchants. For example, the flower shops in Zhangguzhuang and Wangshankou Village mostly purchased cotton directly or indirectly on behalf of the state-owned Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company, and some offered prices lower than the company price to profit from the difference. Farmers in the area reflected, "The government spends a lot of money to buy cotton, but the people don't get much," and "The intermediate exploitation is too severe."

In view of the above situation, the county government, in order to protect the interests of cotton farmers, implement the cotton price policy, prevent unscrupulous merchants from engaging in sabotage, and ensure legitimate profits for cotton merchants, specially convened relevant departments such as the state-owned Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company, the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and the Grain Company to jointly discuss cotton prices, procurement, and management issues. After discussion, it was decided that all relevant departments should uniformly purchase cotton according to the cotton price indicated by the Shijiazhuang Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company (7,500 yuan per jin of ginned cotton and 2,450 yuan per jin of seed cotton), so as to ensure that the prices in all markets are unified. When collecting cotton, it is divided into six grades for evaluation: top, second top, middle, second middle, bottom, and second bottom. Educate cotton brokers and purchasers to earnestly implement this regulation and strictly adhere to the principle of good cotton fetching a good price.

In order to control cotton prices in various markets, the Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company also signed a purchase agreement with the Supply and Marketing Cooperative. In markets with Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company or cotton collection teams, the company or team will purchase cotton themselves, and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative will only purchase cotton from cooperative members in its outlets. In other markets, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative will purchase on behalf of the company. In order to facilitate cotton farmers in selling cotton and cotton merchants in buying cotton, and to prevent cotton brokers from suppressing cotton prices, it was decided to appropriately increase the number of flower markets in various markets and towns, and to assign cadres and relevant departments in each market town to handle this matter. At the same time, it was decided that the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company, the Tax Bureau, and other departments would select seven people to form a working group to regularly go to various markets in cotton-producing areas for inspection and to resolve any problems found at any time. The above measures have begun to be implemented.

　　束鹿县适当调整棉花不合理差价
    统一掌握花价收购新花
    【本报讯】河北束鹿县今春发动群众大量种棉，估计今秋全县可产籽棉三千万斤，比去年多收一千七百余万斤。九月初旬新花大批上市，各集市上花量和成交盛况，为十几年来所未见。
    该县开始购棉时，无人统一掌握，各有关部门又缺乏联系，贸易部门对于市场检查不严，结果各地棉价差额很大。如九月六日二区小章村集上，顶高籽棉每百斤二十六万五千元，次棉二十五万四千元。九月七日王山口村（距小章村十里）集上，顶高籽棉每百斤只有二十三万元，次棉二十二万元，下午又降至二十万元（公司价未落）。其他集市同日同时也各有差别。皮棉比籽棉价格高出许多，商人买了籽棉，轧成皮棉，每百斤可赚十万元，利润过大。由于棉价差额很大，使部分棉农和国营企业受到损失，便利了某些投机捣鬼的商人。如张古庄和王山口村的花店，多是直接间接给国营花纱布公司代购，有的出价低于公司价格，从中渔利。该处农民反映说：“公家买棉花出钱不少，老百姓得钱不多”，“中间剥削太厉害”。
    根据上述情况，该县政府为保护棉农利益，贯彻棉价政策，防止奸商捣鬼，保证正当棉商利润，特召集国营花纱布公司、县供销社及粮食公司等有关部门，共同讨论棉价与收购、管理等问题。经讨论决定：各有关部门统一按石家庄花纱布公司指示的棉价（每斤皮棉七千五百元，籽棉二千四百五十元）收购，务使各市场价格统一。收棉时分为上、次上、中、次中、下、次下六等评级评价。教育棉牙与收购人员认真执行这一规定，严格掌握棉好价高精神。
    为了掌握各市场棉价，花纱布公司又与供销社订立了代购合同。凡有花纱布公司及收花小组的集市，由该公司或小组自行收购，供销社只在门市部内收购社员棉花。其他集市，由供销社代购。为了便利棉农卖棉和棉商买棉，防止棉牙压低棉价，决在各集市酌情增设花市，责成各集镇干部及有关部门办理。同时，决定由供销社、花纱布公司、税务局等部门抽出七人组成工作组，经常赴棉产区各集市检查，随时解决所发现的问题。上述措施已在开始实行中。
