Xinhua News Agency, New York, 8th (TASS): The United Nations General Assembly reconvened in plenary session on October 7th to complete the debate on the Korean question.

The first speaker was Comrade Baranovksy, representative of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, who demanded the rejection of the Anglo-American proposal because this proposal attempts to continue the American aggression in Korea and to cover up this aggression with the authority of the United Nations.

Baranovksy pointed out that although the "mechanical majority" in the Political Committee defeated the proposal submitted by the Soviet Union and four other countries, the American bloc could not thwart the indomitable will to fight for peace embodied in this proposal. Baranovksy declared that the Anglo-American proposal showed a completely different position. American aggressors attempted to force their kind of "peace" on Korea by force and violence, and for this purpose, they used the flag and power of the United Nations and attempted to turn the United Nations into a branch of the State Department.

The next speaker was Mr. Politis, representative of the Greek Royal Fascist regime, who echoed the arguments of the United States and Britain and supported the Anglo-American proposal.

Indian representative Mr. Rau once again called for a compromise resolution. Mr. Rau pointed out that the Indian delegation to the Political Committee had suggested establishing a subcommittee to review the various proposals on the Korean question. He believed that such a subcommittee could carry out useful work.

After Mr. Rau finished speaking, the General Assembly began voting on the Anglo-American proposal, according to which Korea would be militarily occupied by interventionist forces. This proposal passed with forty-seven votes in favor, five votes against, and seven abstentions. The Soviet Union, Byelorussia, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, and Poland voted against it. Yemen, Iraq, India, Syria, Yugoslavia, Egypt, and Lebanon abstained. Indonesia did not participate in the vote.

The General Assembly then voted on each of the main paragraphs of the eight-nation proposal one by one, and later passed the entire proposal.

The General Assembly then began voting on the proposals of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, first voting on each paragraph one by one. With the full activation of the American voting machine, the General Assembly rejected each paragraph. The results of the vote on the first three paragraphs constituting the preamble were as follows: first paragraph—nineteen votes in favor, thirty-five votes against, and six abstentions; second paragraph—nineteen votes in favor, twenty-seven votes against, and fourteen abstentions; third paragraph—fourteen votes in favor, thirty-one votes against, and fifteen abstentions. In this vote, the votes of the Latin American vassal states of the United States and the majority of Marshallized countries constituted the majority of the negative votes. However, Britain abstained from voting on these paragraphs.

The General Assembly then voted on the effective part of the proposal. The first recommendation in the proposal, that the warring parties in Korea "immediately cease hostilities," received six votes in favor, forty-six votes against, and eight abstentions. Voting in favor were the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. Abstaining were Afghanistan, Burma, Egypt, India, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Yemen.

The General Assembly then voted on the second recommendation in the proposal, namely: that the United States and other countries immediately withdraw their troops from Korea, thereby creating conditions for the Korean people to "freely resolve their country's internal affairs with the enjoyment of inalienable sovereignty." In the vote on this paragraph, there were five votes in favor—the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, forty-eight votes against, and seven abstentions—Afghanistan, Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Yemen, and Yugoslavia.

Thereafter, the Anglo-American majority again rejected the other paragraphs of the five-nation proposal.

Under American pressure, the General Assembly even rejected the last paragraph of the five-nation proposal, which stipulated that after the establishment of a national government in Korea, the Security Council should consider approving Korea's membership in the United Nations. This paragraph was defeated with twenty-two votes in favor, twenty-five votes against, and thirteen abstentions.

The General Assembly then also rejected, with five votes in favor, fifty-two votes against, and three abstentions, the Soviet proposal that the General Assembly urge the United States to stop its barbaric bombing of peaceful residents and densely populated cities and villages in Korea. The Soviet Union, Byelorussia, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Ukraine voted in favor. Syria, Yemen, and Yugoslavia abstained.

The General Assembly also rejected, with fifty-five votes against, the Soviet proposal to abolish the United Nations Commission on Korea, on the grounds that the commission was illegally established in violation of the United Nations Charter and that its activities helped incite the Korean civil war. Five votes were in favor of the proposal.

The General Assembly then tried again to elect the third non-permanent member of the Security Council in order to break the deadlock between Turkey and Lebanon formed in the previous votes of the General Assembly. However, in today's vote, Turkey received thirty-three votes and Lebanon received twenty-seven votes. Therefore, neither side obtained the required two-thirds majority. The General Assembly decided to postpone the next vote based on Egypt's proposal.

Next, the General Assembly considered the report of the General Committee, which recommended that many additional items be included in the General Assembly's agenda, including the so-called "Formosa issue" proposed by the United States.

Mr. Malik spoke against including the so-called "Formosa issue" proposed by the United States on the agenda. He pointed out that raising this issue was a violation of the United Nations Charter and an insult to the Chinese people. He pointed out that Taiwan belongs to China and its territorial status has never been in question before. He said that the General Assembly is faced with the issue of American aggression against China, but this matter has been placed on the agenda at the request of the Soviet delegation. Mr. Malik asked the General Assembly to reject the inclusion of the American proposal on the agenda, and that reviewing this American proposal would be a violation of the United Nations Charter.

Mr. Siroky, the representative of Czechoslovakia, strongly supported Mr. Malik, pointing out that the United States was trying its best to use Taiwan as a military base.

Kuomintang element Chiang Ting-fu delivered a speech against including this item on the agenda, reiterating the reasons he gave at the General Committee meeting earlier this week.

American representative Mr. Austin and El Salvador representative argued for including the "Formosa issue" on the agenda.

Then the American voting machine was activated again, and the General Assembly voted to include this item on the agenda. Forty-two votes were in favor, seven votes were against, and eight votes abstained.

After this matter was over, the Lebanese delegation stated that it had decided to withdraw its candidacy for non-permanent member of the Security Council.

In the vote, Turkey received fifty-three votes and Lebanon four votes. Thus, the Netherlands, Brazil, and Turkey were elected as the three new non-permanent members of the Security Council.

The General Assembly then discussed other items recommended by the General Committee for inclusion on the agenda. All of these items were included on the agenda, and the General Assembly adjourned.

　　联大七日会议继续辩论朝鲜问题
    非法通过侵略集团八国提案
    美国表决机器开动否决苏联等五国提案
    侮辱中国人民的“福摩萨问题”竟亦非法列入议程
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约八日电：联合国大会十月七日再度召开全体会议以完成朝鲜问题的辩论。
    第一个发言人为乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国代表巴拉诺夫斯基，他要求否决英美的提案，因为这个提案企图使美国在朝鲜的侵略行为继续下去，并以联合国的权力来掩护这个侵略。
    巴拉诺夫斯基指出：虽然政治委员会中的“机械多数”击败了苏联及其他四个国家所提的提案，但是美国集团不能够挫折这个提案所体现的争取和平的不屈不挠的意志。巴拉诺夫斯基宣称：英美集团的提案却表现了完全不同的立场。美国侵略者以武力及强暴手段企图强使朝鲜接受他们那种“和平”，为了达到这个目的，利用联合国的旗帜和权力，并企图把联合国变成国务院的一个分支机构。
    下一个发言人为希腊保皇法西斯政权的代表波里蒂斯，他附和美国和英国的论据，赞成英美的提案。
    印度代表劳氏再度要求作一个折衷的决议。劳氏指出：政治委员会的印度代表团曾建议成立一个小组委员会审查各项关于朝鲜问题的提案。他认为这样一个小组委员会能进行有益的工作。
    劳氏发言完毕后，大会开始表决英美的提案，按照这个提案，朝鲜将由干涉军进行军事占领。这个提案以四十七票赞成、五票反对及七票弃权通过。苏联、白俄罗斯、乌克兰、捷克斯洛伐克和波兰投票反对。也门、伊拉克、印度、叙利亚、南斯拉夫、埃及和黎巴嫩弃权。印尼未参加投票。
    大会随即逐一表决八国提案的每一主要段落，后来通过了整个提案。
    大会然后开始表决苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的提案，首先是逐一表决每一段。在美国表决机器全力开动之下，大会否决了每一段。构成序言的头三段的表决结果如下：第一段——十九票赞成，三十五票反对，六票弃权；第二段——十九票赞成，二十七票反对，十四票弃权；第三段——十四票赞成，三十一票反对，十五票弃权。在这次表决中，美国的拉丁美洲各附庸国以及大多数马歇尔化国家所投的票构成了反对票的大部分。但是英国在表决这几段时都弃权。
    大会继而表决提案的实效部分。表决提案中的第一个建议，即朝鲜交战双方“立即停止敌对行动”，六票赞成，四十六票反对，八票弃权。投赞成票的是：苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克及南斯拉夫。弃权的是阿富汗、缅甸、埃及、印度、黎巴嫩、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚及也门。
    大会接着表决提案的第二个建议，即：美国及其他国家立即自朝鲜撤兵，从而创立条件使朝鲜人民能以享有“不可让与的主权以自由地解决其国家的内政”。在表决这一段时，有五票赞成——苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克，四十八票反对，七票弃权——阿富汗、埃及、黎巴嫩、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚、也门及南斯拉夫。
    其后英美多数又否决了五国提案的其他各段。
    大会在美国的压力之下甚至否决五国提案的最后一段，这一段规定在朝鲜全国政府成立之后，安全理事会考虑批准朝鲜参加联合国为会员的问题。这一段以二十二票赞成、二十五票反对、十三票弃权而遭否决。
    大会随后又以五票赞成、五十二票反对、三票弃权否决了苏联提议大会敦促美国停止野蛮轰炸朝鲜和平居民和人烟稠密的城市和乡村的提案。苏联、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰及乌克兰投票赞成。叙利亚、也门和南斯拉夫弃权。
    大会并以五十五票反对否决了苏联要求废除联合国朝鲜委员会的提案，这个提案的理由是：该委员会是违反联合国宪章而非法建立的，它的活动帮助煽起了朝鲜的内战。有五票赞成该提案。
    大会然后再次试行选举安全理事会第三个非常任理事，以打破土耳其与黎巴嫩两国在大会前几次会议表决中所形成的僵局。然而今天的表决，土耳其得了三十三票，黎巴嫩得了二十七票。因此双方都没有获得必需的三分之二多数。大会根据埃及的建议决定下次表决暂缓举行。
    接着大会考虑总务委员会的报告，该报告建议将许多额外的项目列入大会议程，其中包括美国提出的所谓“福摩萨问题”。
    马立克发言反对将美国提出的所谓“福摩萨问题”列入议程。他指出，提出这个问题就是违犯联合国宪章，侮辱中国人民。他指出，台湾是属于中国的，它的领土地位以前从来就没有疑问。他说：大会面临着美国侵略中国的问题，但是这件事经苏联代表团的要求已列在议程上。马立克要求大会拒绝把美国提案列入议程，审议美国这个提案是违反联合国宪章的。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表西罗基坚强地支持马立克，他指出美国竭力想利用台湾为军事基地。
    国民党分子蒋廷黻发表演说反对把这一项目列入议程，重申他在本周初总务委员会会议所提出的理由。
    美国代表奥斯汀和萨尔瓦多代表主张把“福摩萨问题”列入议程。
    接着美国表决机器又一次开动，大会投票通过把这一项目列入议程。四十二票赞成，七票反对，八票弃权。
    在这件事结束后，黎巴嫩代表团声明它决定撤回它的安全理事会非常任理事候选权。
    投票结果土耳其得五十三票，黎巴嫩四票。这样，荷兰、巴西和土耳其当选安理会三个新非常任理事。
    大会至此又讨论总务委员会建议列入议程的其他项目。所有这些项目都列入了议程，大会至此即告休会。
