    The Remilitarization of West Germany
    [Xinhua News Agency, 22nd] The 98th issue (59th in the Chinese version) of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" carries an article by Kovalevsky entitled "The Remilitarization of West Germany," which states: The recent meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, as well as the meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, clearly exposed the intention of the American imperialists to rapidly establish a West German army and restore German militarism. The American imperialists plan to use a German army to attack the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, exert pressure on France and other Western European countries, and win world hegemony.
    From the beginning of the occupation, the American and British imperialists began preparing to revive Prussian militarism and use West Germany's war potential to achieve predatory goals. Since the American aggressors suffered defeats in Korea, their concern for developing West Germany's war potential has become even stronger.
    The aggressors have decided to actively utilize their last trump card in Europe—the fascist murderers, militarists, and their monopoly capitalist bosses.
    The author points out that the American aggressors are frantically and hastily carrying out activities in this regard. In order to ease the new righteous indignation among the people against organizing a German army and restoring German militarism, the warmonger Churchill fabricated the slogan of organizing a "European army" for the United States. It was immediately accepted with joy by the German reactionaries.
    The decision to combine the industrial police and the so-called German Labor Battalions into a regular armed force particularly demonstrates the method chosen by American imperialism, which, as the "Cologne Review" said: "Let them wear American uniforms, give them American weapons, and incorporate them into the American army."
    The task of this purely mercenary army is to supplement the American aggressive forces in Europe, and on the other hand, it is the core of the planned West German army.
    The author lists many conclusive materials proving that under this plan of American imperialism, West Germany is gathering and training Nazi military technicians, mobilizing troops, and restoring and developing the mass production of war weapons, turning the entire region into a training base and a secret military area.
    The author writes that the American occupiers are making every effort to collude with German monopoly capitalists, war criminals, army generals, stormtrooper officers, and their political representatives. However, the majority of the people are increasingly hating the rearmament policy. Not only workers, but also petty bourgeois elements in cities and villages, the working intelligentsia, a considerable number of merchants and industrialists, and even many officials belonging to Adenauer's state organs oppose this policy. The German people have expressed their resistance by refusing to serve in the labor battalions, refusing to accept arms, and in other ways. Even some bourgeois newspapers say: "Germany has no interest in arming its youth" (West German Daily). The occupying authorities are taking terrorist actions against peace defenders, but this only further strengthens the declaration of the Third Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party: The occupying forces of Western countries have clearly become an intervention force, engaging in illegal actions in violation of the Potsdam Declaration.
    The author quotes the General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party, Ulbricht, as saying, "The measures to militarize West Germany should be countered by the unanimous resistance of all peace-loving forces throughout the country," and concludes by saying that the German workers, standing at the forefront of the German working masses, will fight with increasing energy to oppose the remilitarization of West Germany, to defend and strengthen peace, and to thwart all imperialist conspiracies to turn West Germany into a base of aggression.

    西德的重新军国主义化
    【新华社二十二日讯】“争取持久和平，争取人民民主!”第九十八期（中文版第五十九期）刊载科瓦留斯基的一篇专文，题为《西德的重新军国主义化》，略称：美、法、英三国外长最近举行的会议，以及北大西洋公约理事会的会议，明显地暴露了美帝国主义者迅速建立一支西德军队和恢复德国军国主义的意图。美国帝国主义者计划用一支德国陆军，去进攻苏联和各人民民主国家，对法国和其他西欧国家施行压力和赢得世界霸权。
    美英帝国主义者从占领开始，就开始准备使普鲁士军国主义复活，并利用西德的战争潜力去达到掠夺的目的。从美国侵略者在朝鲜吃败仗的时候起，他们对发展西德战争潜力的关心就更强了。
    侵略者已决定积极利用他们在欧洲的最后一套法宝——法西斯杀人犯和军国主义者以及他们的垄断资本老板们。
    作者指出，美国侵略者在这方面正狂热而忽忙地进行活动。为了缓和人民中间对组织德国军队和恢复德国军国主义的新的义愤，战争贩子邱吉尔为美国制造了一个组织“欧洲军队”的口号。它立刻被德国反动派欢天喜地地接受。
    关于把工业警察和所谓德国劳动大队合编为一支正规武装部队的决定，特别显著地表现了美国帝国主义所选择的方式，就是如“科隆评论”所说的：“让他们穿上美国制服，给他们美国武器，并把他们编入美国军队”。
    这支纯粹雇佣性的军队的任务是补充美国在欧洲的侵略军队，另一方面又是计划中的西德军队的核心。
    作者列举许多确凿材料，证明在美帝国主义这一计划下，西德正在搜罗和训练纳粹军事技术人员，动员兵力，并恢复和发展战争武器的大量制造，把整个区域变成练兵基地和秘密军事区域。
    作者写道，美国占领者竭力勾结德国的垄断资本家、战争罪犯、陆军将领、冲锋队军官以及他们利益的政治代表。但是大多数人民越来越仇恨重新武装的政策。不仅工人，而且城市和乡村中的小资产阶级分子、劳动知识阶层、相当多的商人与工业家、甚至属于阿登纳国家机关的许多官员都反对这种政策。德国人民以拒绝在劳动大队中服役及拒绝接受武装以及其他各种方式表现了他们的反抗。连一些资产阶级的报纸都说：“德国对武装它的青年一事，一点也不感到兴趣”（西德日报语）。占领当局对和平保卫者采取恐怖行动，但这只是更增强了德国统一社会党第三次大会的声明：西方国家的占领军已明白地成为一支干涉军，从事违反波茨坦宣言的非法行动。
    作者引了统一社会党总书记乌布利希的话“使西德军事化的措施应以所有爱好和平的力量举国一致的抵抗来反击”，并作结称，站在德国劳动群众最前列的德国工人将以不断增加的精力进行斗争，以反对西德的重新军国主义化，以保卫和增强和平，并挫败使西德变成侵略基地的一切帝国主义阴谋。
