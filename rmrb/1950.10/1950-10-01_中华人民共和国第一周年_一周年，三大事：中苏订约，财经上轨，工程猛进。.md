　　The First Anniversary of the People's Republic of China
    One Year, Three Major Events: Sino-Soviet Treaty, Economic Recovery, Engineering Advances.
    Huang Yanpei, Convenor of the Standing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association
    On October 1, 1949, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China was proclaimed. In the past year, the people across the country have been excitedly, arduously, and calmly doing their work in every position.
    Let's clearly recall that in this year, the People's Liberation War has nearly been completed. Starting from last October, victorious news continued to arrive: Guangzhou was liberated on October 14th, Xiamen was liberated on the 17th, and on the same day, the People's Liberation Army entered Dihua. Guiyang was liberated on November 15th, Guilin on the 22nd, Chongqing on the 30th, Kunming on December 9th, and Zhennanguan, the southernmost point of the mainland, was recovered on the 11th. Chengdu was liberated on the 25th, the entire Hainan Island was liberated on April 30th this year, and Dinghai Zhoushan was liberated on May 17th. What remains uncompleted is only Tibet on land and Taiwan at sea.
    In this year, there are three things that the government has done that are particularly commendable from a purely objective point of view:
    (1) The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. This Sino-Soviet treaty has already aroused extreme attention from all parties in terms of its text. In reality, what is particularly noteworthy is the beginning of a great ideological union between the people of China and the Soviet Union, not just between the governments. As early as after the success of the October Revolution in 1917, the Soviet Union declared its abandonment of the unequal treaties signed between Tsarist Russia and various countries. In July 1919 and September 1920, it successively issued declarations to China, reiterating its previous intention, and subsequently took the lead in abolishing the unequal treaties against us signed by Tsarist Russia. These words and deeds were all concealed by the imperialists and their lackeys, who also created many rumors to deceive the Chinese people. The chronic aggression of European and American imperialism was already painful enough, followed by the acute "open robbery" aggression of Japanese imperialism, while the bureaucratic capitalists shamelessly fished in troubled waters. The Chinese people, under unbearable circumstances, became conscious. They realized that we could not survive unless imperialism and the extremely ugly bureaucratic capitalism were overthrown. Following the nationwide victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, the People's Liberation Army was welcomed by the masses wherever it went, north, south, east, and west. The main reason for this psychological phenomenon lies in this. The Chinese people further realized: Who is our enemy? Who is our friend? The two distinct camps of the world are clearly in front of us. The pioneers advocate, and the followers follow. We should remember that before the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty on February 14, 1950, there was also the joint statement by ten parties led by the Communist Party of China on April 4, 1949, representing the national public opinion of the Chinese people against the North Atlantic Treaty, the main sentence of which was: "The democratic parties of China solemnly declare on behalf of the great Chinese people that if the imperialist aggressive group dares to provoke this reactionary war that endangers the people of the world, we will unite the people of the whole country with China's ally, the Soviet Union, and the peaceful and democratic forces of all countries, and work hand in hand to resolutely fight against the initiators of the war of aggression." This clearly indicates that the international path we have taken has been determined. Moreover, this path has been generally recognized by the people. The successful signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty is the concretization of the union between the peoples of the two countries. It is not only a formality, but also the spiritual manifestation of the great unity of 900 million people in China, the Soviet Union, and other democratic countries on the entire planet, which cannot but be regarded as a major event in the world.
    (2) The sudden return of China's financial and economic situation to the right track. More than a hundred years of imperialist aggression, the support of the fourteen-year long War of Resistance against Japan, coupled with the continuous plunder of the people's wealth by the Chiang Kai-shek gang, made China full of holes. It was quickly liberated, and the most difficult task should be the reorganization of finance and economy. In this year, the initial financial and economic situation was indeed not good, and it can be said to be very bad. However, after the government's efforts in the three months of March, April, and May, first, the national financial and economic work was unified: the central government said that it would uniformly manage and allocate the national public grain revenue and expenditure, and it would be subject to unified management and allocation; the central government said that it would uniformly implement the management of national cash, and it would be subject to unified implementation of management; the central government said that it would uniformly check and allocate national warehouse materials, and it would be subject to unified check and allocation; the central government said that it would uniformly manage national state-owned trade, and it would be subject to unified management of state-owned trade. Which government has done these things in the past?! The People's Government has calmly and completely done it. As a result, the fiscal revenue and expenditure are close to balance, the fiscal deficit is small, and the number of banknotes issued is very small. As a result, the currency is stable and the prices are stable. Has the government taken more from the people? No, on the contrary, it has been reduced. The principle of agricultural tax collection has been reduced from 17% to 13%, and the salt tax has been reduced to 50%. Please see that the total amount of annual grain paid by farmers in the Northeast puppet Manchuria was 8 million tons, while the total amount of grain collected by the government in 1949 was only 2.3 million tons, and other cases are similar. These are all obvious facts, which do not need or cannot be fabricated for propaganda. The current price: since May, grain prices have continued to fall across the country, and other prices have remained stable or slightly increased. From May to August, grain prices in the six major cities of Beijing, Wuhan, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Chongqing fell by an average of 5.2%. The latest report is like this. Prices are stable, and people's hearts are stable. This is a very difficult thing to achieve.
    (3) The rapid progress of railway transportation and various construction projects. Under the urgent war situation and various difficulties and obstacles of manpower and material resources, the most needed but most difficult should be the railway engineering. What was dared not to be expected to be completed and repaired in 1949 after liberation, such as the Beijing-Hankou and Guangzhou-Hankou railways, were opened to traffic one after another at the end of last December. The Zhengzhou Yellow River Railway Bridge was overaged for sixteen years, and general engineers believed that it must be transformed. Trains passing through the entire bridge took 180 minutes. In the past, the government was unable to restore the normal speed. After liberation, with the design and reinforcement of Soviet engineers, when it was opened to traffic at the end of 1949, it only took 22 minutes to pass through the entire bridge. Pukou Wharf is the junction of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, becoming a distribution and transfer center for north-south water and land materials. Due to years of disrepair and subsidence of the foundation, six of the ten wharves upstream and downstream of Pukou have collapsed. After liberation, the People's Government decided to build it. The Ministry of Communications of the Central Government, together with relevant departments at all levels, invited Chinese and Soviet experts to design and repair it. All revetment projects and dredging projects were completed as scheduled in August. It was a difficult task. The Liujiang Bridge project connecting the Xiang-Gui and Qian-Gui railways was particularly dangerous. It was completed and opened to traffic ahead of schedule in August. In terms of water conservancy, from last winter to this spring, 4.69 million people across the country were mobilized to repair dikes and dig rivers, completing 350 million cubic meters of earthwork, which is unprecedented in China. The total amount of earthwork, if built into dikes one meter high and wide, can surround the equator more than eight times. After this widespread repair, the ability of rivers to resist floods has been greatly improved. At the same time, combined with disaster relief, work-for-relief was used to help 10 million people in disaster-stricken areas to survive the spring famine; in order to divert the Yi River into the sea, 580,000 people were mobilized in northern Jiangsu this year, and successively completed a new 200-kilometer sea channel, with dikes 400 kilometers long on both sides, ensuring that 5 million mu of land along the coast would not be affected by floods. After the test of this year's flood, the new channel is very safe. There is one point in these large projects that is worth paying great attention to, that is, they are very closely and enthusiastically combined with the broad masses of the people, and the people are automatically gathering to work for themselves.
    Of course, there are countless things besides these three. There is one thing, this year, reports from various places say that the autumn harvest is abundant. Some say that the harvest has reached 110%, some say that it has not happened for decades. Individual people have investigated the reason and said: "Chairman Mao has great fortune." Of course, this can only be laughed at. In fact, it cannot be entirely attributed to heaven. The local government is particularly serious about agricultural affairs, from loans, deployment of spring plowing, promotion of intensive cultivation, to safeguarding the autumn harvest, field selection, seedling protection, ditching, weeding, topdressing, pest and disease control—in some places, frost prevention—livestock protection, prevention and control of animal diseases, mutual aid in changing work, training of model workers, and finally acquisition, acceptance, and rent reduction. These are all seen in official documents, and the prior planning and the post-event reports account for a large part of the official documents. Originally, these were all the people's affairs, but now they have become the government's affairs, the government's and the people's cooperative affairs. Such efforts, such meticulousness, the effort will not be in vain. Although the fruits cannot be seen for a while, can it be said that it has nothing to do with the good harvest? Even the water conservancy mentioned above cannot be said to have nothing to do with the good harvest. Every major river has flood control command posts set up upstream and downstream, and the water level rises and falls are reported publicly every day. When it is critical, the people exert infinite power and use their bodies to replace earth and stones, called "meat dikes". If there is no rescue, a large group of lives will be lost to the east. After all, the majority are rescued. "You are the people, serve the people." Once this slogan is put forward, there is nothing to be afraid of. The people are really arduous! Arduous! Really great! Great!
    In the meantime, our staff still have many deviations and many faults. They are constantly learning humbly, constantly self-criticizing, and also welcome others' criticism.
    I believe that from the second anniversary onwards, all staff will still be so excited, arduously, and calmly standing in every position, doing their work. Of course, they have even greater tasks. They must fight with imperialism and complete their sacred mission of recovering all their territory and liberating the people of the whole country.

　　中华人民共和国第一周年
    一周年，三大事：中苏订约，财经上轨，工程猛进。
    民主建国会常务委员会召集人  黄炎培
    一九四九年十月一日中华人民共和国中央人民政府宣告成立，到今一周年了，这一周年中间，全国人民站在每一个岗位，都在兴奋地、艰苦地、镇定地，干他们的工作。
    我们清楚地回想一下，在这一周年中间，人民解放战争，已经接近完成了，从去年十月起，继续胜利消息，十月十四日广州解放，十七日厦门解放，同日解放军开入迪化，十一月十五日贵阳解放，二十二日桂林解放，三十日重庆解放，十二月九日昆明解放，十一日大陆国境极南端镇南关也收复了，二十五日成都解放，今年四月三十日海南岛全部解放，五月十七日定海舟山解放。所没有完成的，陆上只有西藏，海面只有台湾。
    这一周年中间，政府干的工作，纯客观地认为特别值得称道的，有三事：
    （一）中苏友好同盟互助条约的订立。这回中苏订约，已经从文字方面惹起各方极度的重视了，实际上尤其值得重视的，乃是中苏两国间不单单是政府，而是人民间思想大结合的开始，苏联对我中国，远在一九一七年十月革命成功以后，即宣告放弃帝俄和各国间所订不平等条约，一九一九年七月，一九二○年九月，还先后发表对华宣言，重申前意，随后将帝俄所订对我不平等条约，首先实行废除。这些文字和事实，都给帝国主义和它的走狗们一手遮掩掉，还造了不少谣言，使全中国人民耳目都被蒙蔽着，欧美帝国主义慢性的侵略已够受苦了，再来一个日本帝国主义急性的“明火执仗”的侵略，而官僚资本主义还无耻地在混水里摸鱼，中国人民在忍无可忍之下，自觉了。自觉到帝国主义连同丑恶无比的官僚资本主义一天不打倒，我们一天不得生存；接在全国人民坚决抗日胜利之后，人民解放军所到之处，南北东西，万众欢迎。这些心理造成的主因，就在这上边，中国人民还进一步自觉，自觉到谁是我敌？谁是我友？全世界清清楚楚地两大阵容摆在眼前，先知先觉者倡导着，后知后觉者追随着，我们应记得，一九五○年二月十四日中苏订约之先，还有一九四九年四月四日中国共产党领导的十个党派代表全国人民公意反对北大西洋公约的联合声明，中间主要文句是：“中国各民主党派代表伟大的中国人民郑重宣言，如果帝国主义侵略集团竟敢挑动这危害世界人民的反动的战争，那么我们将团结全国人民与中国盟友苏联和各国和平民主势力，携手并进，向侵略战争的发动者作坚决的斗争”，这就是很显明地指出我们所走国际路线已经确定了。而且这条路线已经是人民公认的了，中苏订约成功，就是两国间人民结合的具体化，不单单是形式，还有全地球中苏和其他民主国家九万万人民大团结的精神表现在中间，这不能不看做全世界天大的一件大事。
    （二）中国财政经济状况的突然地扶上轨道。一百多年的帝国主义侵略，支撑到十四年之久的抗日苦战，加上蒋匪帮把民脂民膏不断地搜刮，这样百孔千疮的中国，很快的解放了，最艰难的，应是财政经济的整理工作，这一周年，初期的财经状况，确是不很好的，而且可以说是很不好的，但经过了三、四、五这三个月间政府的努力，第一，全国财经工作统一了：中央说，要统一保管调度全国公粮收支，就听候统一保管调度；中央说，要统一实行管理全国现金，就听候统一实行管理；中央说，要统一清查调配全国仓库物资，就听候统一清查调配；中央说，要统一管理全国公营贸易，就听候统一管理公营，这些，过去那一个政府做到过呢？！人民政府却不慌不忙地完全做到，结果，财政收支接近平衡了，财政赤字不大，增发的钞票很少，结果，通货稳定了，物价稳定了，是不是政府取之于民加重了些呢？不，相反地恰是减轻，农业税征收原则由百分之十七减到十三，盐税减到百分之五十，请看东北伪满时农民纳年粮总额八百万吨，一九四九年政府收粮总额仅二百三十万吨，其他是相类的。这都是有目共见的事实，不需要也不可能来制造宣传的，眼前的物价：从五月份起，全国各地粮价继续下跌，其他物价保持平稳，或微微上涨，从五月份到八月份，京、汉、沪、津、穗、渝、六大城市粮价下跌，平均到百分之五点二，最近报告是这样的，物价定了，人心定了，这是一桩很不容易做到的事情。
    （三）铁道交通各项建设工程的突飞猛进，在战事紧迫，人力物力种种困难阻碍之下，最感需要，但最感艰苦，应是铁路工程，解放后所不敢实望于一九四九年完成修复的，如京汉、粤汉两路，都在去年十二月底先后通车了，郑州黄河铁桥过龄了十六年，一般工程师认为非改造不可，火车通过全桥须一百八十分钟，过去政府是无法回复经常速度的，解放后，经苏联工程师设计加固，到一九四九年年底通车时，仅二十二分钟已通过全桥了，浦口码头是沪宁铁路和津浦铁路接轨地，成为南北水陆物资集散转运中心，由于年久失修，基地下陷，浦口上下游十个码头，陷落了六个，解放后，人民政府决心修建，中央交通部会同各级有关部门邀请中苏专家，设计抢修，所有护岸工程，疏浚工程，一律于八月如期完成，是一桩艰险的工作，联络湘桂黔桂两路的柳江桥工尤险，于八月提前完工通车了，水利从去年冬季到今年春季，为修堤挖河，全国动员了民众四百六十九万人，完成了土工三亿五千万公方，这在中国是空前的，土工的总量，如果筑成高宽各一公尺的堤埝，可以围绕赤道八周有余，全国经过这次普遍的培修，河流抵御洪水的能力大大提高，同时结合救灾，以工代赈，使受灾地区一千万人借此度过春荒；为了导沂入海，今年苏北动员了五十八万民众，先后完成了二百公里的入海新道，两岸堤长四百公里，保障了沿岸五百万亩土地不受水灾，经过今年洪水的考验，新道甚感安全，这些大工程，中间有一点值得大大注意，他们是很亲切地，很热烈地和广大民众结合的，民众都自动集合起来，为自己工作。
    当然，三件以外，还数不尽。有一事，今年各地报告秋禾丰收，有的说收成到百分之一百几十，有的说几十年来所没有，个别的老百姓追究出原因来了，说：“毛主席福气大”，这当然只有报之一笑，实际上倒也不能完全归功于天，地方政府对农事是特别认真的，从贷款，布置春耕，提倡精耕细作，到保卫秋收，田间选种、保苗、开沟洫、除草、追肥、除病虫害，——有的地方，防霜——护畜、防治兽疫、变工互助、培养劳模、最后收购、受抵、减租，这些，累累地都见之于公文，事前的计划，事后的报告，要占到公文一大部分，原来都是老百姓的事，今变成政府的事，政府和老百姓合作的事，这样努力，这样精细周密，功夫是不会白费的，虽然一时看不见果实，能说和丰收没有关系么？就是上文提到的水利，也不能说和丰收没有关系，每一条大水，上下游设防汛指挥所，每天公开报告水位涨落，到危急时，民众发挥出无穷大的力量，把身体代土石，名“肉堤”，有抢救不了的，大群生命，付之东流，到底获救者占多数，“自己是人民，为人民服务”，这口号一提出，什么都不怕，民众真艰苦！艰苦！真伟大！伟大！
    这中间我们工作人员也还有不少偏差，不少过失，是在不断地虚心学习，不断地自我批评，还欢迎人家批评。
    我相信从第二周年起，全部工作人员还是这样兴奋地，艰苦地，镇定地，站在每个岗位上，干他们的工作。当然，他们还有更伟大的任务，他们要和帝国主义搏斗，要完成他们收复全部国土，解放全国人民的神圣使命。
        一九五○年九月
