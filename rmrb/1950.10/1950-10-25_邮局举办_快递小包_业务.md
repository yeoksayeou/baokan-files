The Postal General Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has launched an "Express Small Package" service to facilitate the convenient and rapid delivery of small, scattered personal items. The Beijing Postal Administration and its affiliated branches have already implemented it. These small packages will be handled as fast mail. The weight limit is temporarily set at one kilogram. The maximum volume should not exceed five cubic inches, and the longest side should not exceed five inches. The minimum volume should not be less than 7.5 centimeters (9/4 市寸), and the width and thickness should not be less than 5 centimeters (3/2 市寸). In addition to the regular small package fee, an extra registration and express fee will be charged. The service also supports insured value, cash-on-delivery, and poste restante options. The value and contents should be written on the upper left corner of the front of the package or on the back, without needing to fill out a separate parcel form (the post office can help write this if the sender cannot). These small packages, like letters, will be delivered to the recipient by the post office. For detailed information, please inquire at your nearest post office.

　　邮局举办“快递小包”业务
    邮电部邮政总局为适应个人零星小件物品之寄递便利与迅速起见，特举办“快递小包”业务。现北京邮管局及所属各支局已经实行。此种小包，均照快信办理，其重量暂以一公斤为限，最大体积不得超过五立方公英寸，最长不得超过五公英寸，最小体积长不得少于七公分半（即９／４市寸），宽厚不得少于五公分（即３／２市寸）。寄费除按普通小包同样计收外，另收一个挂号快递费，并可作保价、代收货价及存局候领的办法交寄，只要将价值、内容写在该包正面左上角或背面，不必另填包裹单（如寄件人不会写，邮局可代写）。此项小包，和信函一样，由邮局投送给收件人。详细办法，可向就近邮局询问。
