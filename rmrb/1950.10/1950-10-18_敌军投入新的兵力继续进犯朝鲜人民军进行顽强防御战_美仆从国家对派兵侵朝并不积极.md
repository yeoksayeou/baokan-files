　　Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The American imperialists' plot to massively use the armies of puppet states to replenish the cannon fodder for the war of aggression against Korea continues to be met with passive resistance and delays by some puppet states. According to a United Press dispatch from Brussels on the 14th, quoting Belgian Ministry of Defense sources: Belgium will not be able to send a full battalion to Korea as originally planned; the current number of volunteers is only around seven hundred. Almost four hundred people withdrew their applications when they were about to sign on the dotted line of the volunteer application form. According to a United Press dispatch from Ottawa: The 10,000 troops originally designated by Canada are scheduled to be "fully trained" by February of next year, and "training has not yet begun." Moreover, the future actions of these 10,000 troops are "subject to significant changes."

    【新华社十七日讯】美国帝国主义阴谋大规模利用仆从国家的军队来补充侵朝战争炮灰的计划，正继续受到一些仆从国家消极怠工和拖延。据合众社布鲁塞尔十四日电引比利时国防部人士谈话：比国将不能依照原来计划派遣一整营人到朝鲜去，现在所有的志愿军只有七百人之谱。差不多有四百人在将要在志愿兵申请书的虚线上签名时，撤销了他们的申请。另据合众社渥太华消息：加拿大原来指派的军队一万人，计划是要到明年二月才“训练完毕”，现在“还没有开始训练”。而这一万军队将来的行止且“大有改变的可能”。
