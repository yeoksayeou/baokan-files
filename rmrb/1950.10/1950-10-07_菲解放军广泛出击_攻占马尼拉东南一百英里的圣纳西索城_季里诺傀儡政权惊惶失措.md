　　Philippine Liberation Army Launches Extensive Offensives
    Captures San Narciso City 100 Miles Southeast of Manila
    Quirino Puppet Regime Panicked
    [Xinhua News Agency, 6th] According to a Manila dispatch from the Associated Press on the 2nd: The Philippine People's Liberation Army captured San Narciso City on Bondoc Peninsula, 100 miles southeast of Manila, on September 30th, and seized all ships docked in the port.

    The continued extensive offensives of the Philippine People's Liberation Army have made the Quirino ruling clique even more panicked. According to an Agence France-Presse Manila dispatch: Philippine puppet government Defense Minister Magsaysay recently publicly admitted: "The situation in Central Luzon has deteriorated, and the 40,000 Hukbalahap troops in the area have become bolder due to their recent victories." According to another Associated Press Manila dispatch: Magsaysay recently inspected Pangasinan Province, where the Philippine People's Liberation Army is extremely active, and believes that the "situation is getting worse and worse." Magsaysay also strongly urged the heads of the local demoralized Philippine puppet army and police to "eliminate differences of opinion." The "Philippine Herald," the mouthpiece of the Philippine puppet government, also exclaimed on September 22nd that the threat of the "Hukbalahap" is "more imminent and more dangerous."

　　菲解放军广泛出击
    攻占马尼拉东南一百英里的圣纳西索城
    季里诺傀儡政权惊惶失措
    【新华社六日讯】据合众社马尼拉二日讯：菲律宾人民解放军于九月三十日攻占马尼拉东南一百英里邦达克半岛上的圣纳西索城，并掳获了所有停泊在港口的船只。
    菲律宾人民解放军的继续广泛出击，使得季里诺统治集团更加慌乱。据法新社马尼拉讯：菲傀儡政府国防部长麦格赛赛于最近公开承认：“中吕宋的局势已恶化，该地区的四万民抗军已由于他们最近的胜利变得更加大胆了。”另据合众社马尼拉讯：麦格赛赛最近曾到菲人民解放军极为活跃的蜂牙丝兰省视察，认为该地的“情况愈来愈糟”。麦格赛赛并力劝当地士气离散的菲傀儡军队和警察的首脑“消除分歧意见”。菲傀儡政府的喉舌《菲律宾先驱报》，于九月二十二日也惊呼“民抗军”的威胁，“更迫在眉睫而且危险更大”。
