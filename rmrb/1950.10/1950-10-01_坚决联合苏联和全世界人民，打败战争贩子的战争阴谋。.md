　　Today is the first National Day of our People's Republic of China. We should pay tribute to Chairman Mao and the heroic People's Liberation Army. In the past year, under the leadership of our wise leader Chairman Mao, we have defeated the running dog of American imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and achieved an initial improvement in the national economic situation. Transportation has quickly recovered and developed, and construction work has advanced by leaps and bounds, laying a good foundation for the prosperity of our country. The people's lives have seen initial improvements. This is the first great happy event in the history of the Chinese people. Some time ago, I read a book called "The Long March." One part of it described the night of the Lunar New Year's Eve in 1935, when the heroic Red Army arrived on the south bank of the Wu River in Guizhou. At that time, several regiments of the enemy were blocking the north bank, preventing the Red Army from crossing. The heroic Red Army organized commando teams, some swimming, some sitting on small bamboo rafts, crossing the river overnight. At this time, it was snowing heavily, and the water was cold and deep, with black waves rolling. It was very difficult to cross. When they reached the opposite bank, the comrades were so frozen that their teeth chattered. Everyone squeezed together at the foot of the mountain, back to back, chest to chest, warming each other with their breath. In the end, they defeated the enemy and victoriously crossed the Wu River. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, the People's Liberation Army bravely attacked the enemy, shed countless blood and sweat, and experienced countless hardships before defeating the enemy and winning today's victory, exchanging it for today's National Day. This is such an amazing thing! Therefore, when we commemorate National Day today, we must carry forward the spirit of hard struggle and overcoming difficulties in the past, take practical actions, produce more, think of more ways, improve our transportation efficiency, reduce transportation costs, and complete tasks without compromise to build our people's railway well. On the other hand, we must consolidate the unity of our workers, peasants, and soldiers, unite the people of the whole country as hard as steel, and eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of American imperialism, completely and cleanly. At the same time, we must resolutely unite with the Soviet Union, the big brother leading the peace-loving countries, and the people of the world to smash the war conspiracies of the war mongers, so that all the people of the world can live a free and happy life.

　　坚决联合苏联和全世界人民，打败战争贩子的战争阴谋。
    全总直接评选工业劳模代表  李永
    今天是咱们中华人民共和国的第一个国庆日，我们应该向毛主席和英勇的人民解放军致敬。一年来，我们在英明的领袖毛主席领导下，打垮了美帝国主义走狗国民党反动派，争取了全国经济情况的初步好转，交通很快的恢复和发展，建设工作突飞猛进，给我们国家的繁荣，打下了良好的基础。人民生活有了初步的改善。这是中国人民有史以来的头一件大喜事。前些时，我看了一本“二万五千里长征”的书，里边有一篇写着的是一九三五年大年三十晚上，英勇的红军来到贵州乌江南岸。当时敌人有好几个团堵在北岸，阻挡红军过江，英勇的红军组织了突击队，有的浮水，有的坐着小竹排，连夜渡江。这时候，天空里下着大雪，水又冷又深，黑浪一滚一滚的，非常难渡。赶到渡到对岸，同志们都冻得牙齿磕磕的响，大家伙挤在山脚下，背靠着背，胸贴着胸，互相拿热气暖和着，结果还打败了敌人，胜利的渡过了乌江。抗日战争和解放战争中，人民解放军又英勇的打击敌人，流了无数的血汗，经历了无数的艰难困苦，才战胜了敌人，赢得了今天的胜利，换来了今天的国庆。这是多么不容易的事情啊！所以我们今天纪念国庆，一定要发扬过去的艰苦奋斗，克服困难的精神，拿出实际行动，多生产，多想办法，提高我们的运输效率，减低运输成本，不折不扣的完成任务，建设好我们人民铁路。另一方面，要巩固我们工农兵的团结，把全国的人民团结的像钢铁一样硬，把美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石消灭个彻底干净。同时要坚决联合苏联老大哥为首的爱好和平的国家，和全世界人民，粉碎战争贩子的战争阴谋，使我们全世界人民都能过自由、幸福的生活。
