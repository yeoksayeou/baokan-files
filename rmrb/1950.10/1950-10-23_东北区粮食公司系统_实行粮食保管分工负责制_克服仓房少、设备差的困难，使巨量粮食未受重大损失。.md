　　Northeast China Grain Company System
    Implements Grain Storage Responsibility System
    Overcomes Difficulties of Few Warehouses and Poor Equipment, Preventing Major Losses of Huge Amounts of Grain.
    [Reported by this newspaper] According to news from the Northeast Daily: The Northeast China Grain Company system has implemented a grain storage responsibility system, overcoming equipment difficulties and completing the arduous task of storage.

　　Since the fourth quarter of last year, the Grain Company has been purchasing grain and receiving public grain. By the end of August this year, it had handled a total of more than 3.6 million tons of grain, with an average monthly storage volume of more than 600,000 tons, half of which was stored in the open air. Thanks to the round-the-clock turning, airing, and stacking by all staff members, the difficulties of having few warehouses and poor equipment were overcome, and the hot summer was overcome. Ultimately, huge amounts of grain did not suffer major losses. The annual loss was greatly reduced compared to last year.

　　The first reason for achieving this success is that leaders at all levels corrected ideological deviations and attached importance to storage work. When the rainy season was approaching this year, a large amount of grain was still stored in grain stations and had to be stored for a long time. At that time, the main obstacle in the work was the prevailing mentality of seeking better treatment among cadres. The Ministry of Trade and the Regional Company issued special orders to all localities to break with conventions, actively prepare, and do a good job in storage. The manager of the Liaoxi Provincial Company personally led the research and improved the storage system and organization. The Heilongjiang Provincial Company conducted in-depth mobilization and education for its subordinate cadres, which enhanced the sense of responsibility of all personnel for grain storage, thus laying the ideological foundation for storage work. Second, a storage system was established. In June, the city and county companies established grain storage inspection committees one after another in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Trade. According to the work of storage, inspection, measurement, and testing, a clear division of labor was implemented, and specific personnel were designated to be responsible. And formulated a level-by-level reporting system from the county company to the provincial company to the regional company, so that the regional company could uniformly grasp the situation in the entire region, discover changes in grain, and supervise rescue. For example, in June, a total of more than 3.4 million catties of grain in Shenyang, Liaoxi, Liaodong, and Jilin became heated. In July and August, the heated grain in various places reached 10 million kilograms. They were all out of danger after all the storage personnel carried out blowing, sifting, pounding, and stacking, avoiding huge losses to the country. Third, due to the creativity of storage personnel in many areas, improved technology, overcame equipment difficulties, strengthened testing and storage, and carried out work to improve grain quality, avoiding blind pounding and turning, and reducing grain deterioration and loss. The average storage volume of Anda and Hailun in Heilongjiang Province, Boli, Bayan, Wuchang, and Shangzhi in Songjiang Province, Dehui, Sanchahe, Gongzhuling in Jilin Province, Xi'an in Liaodong Province, and Kaiyuan, Shuangliao, and Siping in Liaoxi Province were all above 10,000 tons, but the grain did not suffer any losses.

　　However, in a few units, such as Anshan City, Tonghua City, Changchun City, Jiangmifeng, Suizhong, Kangping and other cities and counties, due to the leadership's neglect of storage work and lack of ideological education, although systems were also established, they were negligent in inspection, especially due to the failure to implement the responsibility system, resulting in losses to state property. The situation in Anshan City Company was the most serious, with 600,000 kilograms of bad grain. After the Suizhong County Company discovered that the soybeans had deteriorated, not only did it fail to report it, but it also buried the bad grain, attempting to deceive the higher authorities to escape responsibility.

　　In order to accept the experience and lessons of storing grain in the past year and do a good job in future storage work, the Northeast China Grain Company specially convened a joint meeting of storage and testing work of provincial and municipal companies last month. After careful discussion, the meeting resolved that before grain purchase, all localities must clearly divide the nature of warehouses and strictly distinguish between long-term, temporary, and transfer warehouses. Strengthen the allocation of grain testers and inspectors, and earnestly implement grading and storage according to grades. Thoroughly clean grain warehouses and grain piles, and disinfect them when necessary to avoid pests.

### 东北区粮食公司系统  实行粮食保管分工负责制  克服仓房少、设备差的困难，使巨量粮食未受重大损失。

　　东北区粮食公司系统
    实行粮食保管分工负责制
    克服仓房少、设备差的困难，使巨量粮食未受重大损失。
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：东北区粮食公司系统，实行粮食保管分工负责制，克服了器材困难，完成保管的艰巨任务。
    粮食公司自去年第四季度开始收购粮食与接收公粮，至今年八月末，经营粮食共计三百六十余万吨，平均每月保管量达六十余万吨，其中有二分之一为露天保管。由于全体工作人员日以继夜的翻晒、出风、捣垛，克服了仓库少、设备差的困难，战胜了炎热的夏季，终使巨量的粮食未受重大损失。全年损耗较去年大为减少。
    获得这种成绩的第一个原因，是各级领导干部纠正了思想偏差，重视了保管工作。今年雨季将届时，各地粮栈尚存大批粮食必须长期保管。当时工作中的主要障碍，是干部中普遍的存在着待遇思想。贸易部及区公司特通令各地打破惯例，积极准备，做好保管工作。辽西省公司经理亲自领导研究，健全了保管制度与组织。黑龙江省公司对所属干部进行了深入的动员教育，提高了全体人员对粮食保管的责任心，因而打下了保管工作的思想基础。第二，建立了保管制度。六月份各市县公司根据贸易部指示，相继建立了粮食保管检查委员会，根据保管、检查、记量、化验等工作，实行明确分工，指定专人负责。并制定从县公司到省公司到区公司的按级汇报制度，以便区公司统一掌握全区情况，发现粮食变化，督促抢救。如六月份沈阳、辽西、辽东、吉林计有三百四十余万斤粮食发热，七、八月份各地发热粮竟达一千万公斤，均在全体保管人员进行吹风、过筛、捣囤、捣垛后脱险，未造成国家巨大损失。第三，由于不少地区保管人员发挥了创造性，提高技术，克服了器材的困难，加强化验与保管，进行提高粮食质量工作，避免了盲目捣囤翻晒，减少了粮谷变质损耗。黑龙江省的安达、海伦，松江省的勃利、巴彦、五常、尚志，吉林省的德惠、三岔河、公主岭，辽东省的西安，辽西省的开原、双辽、四平等县市公司，平均保管量虽在万吨以上，粮谷仍未遭受损失。
    也有少数单位，如鞍山市、通化市、长春市、江密峰、绥中、康平等市县公司，由于领导上忽视保管工作，缺乏思想教育，虽也建立了制度，但是疏于检查，特别由于未贯彻责任制，结果使国家财产受了损失。鞍山市公司的情况最严重，坏粮达六十万公斤。绥中县公司发现大豆变质后，不但不汇报，且将坏粮埋藏，企图欺骗上级逃避责任。
    东北区粮食公司为接受一年来保管粮食的经验教训，做好今后的保管工作，特于上月召开了各省市公司保管化验工作联席会议，会议经过缜密讨论，决议在购粮前各地即须明确划分仓库性质，将长期、临时及转运仓库严格区别。加强配备粮食化验员、检查员，确实执行分等收购、分等保管。彻底打扫粮仓、粮囤，必要时进行消毒，以免发生虫害。
