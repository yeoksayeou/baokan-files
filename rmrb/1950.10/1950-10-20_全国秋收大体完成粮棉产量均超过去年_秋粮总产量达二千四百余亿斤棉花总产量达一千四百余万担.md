　　National Autumn Harvest Largely Completed, Grain and Cotton Production Exceeds Last Year
    Total Autumn Grain Production Reaches 240 Billion Jin, Total Cotton Production Reaches 14 Million Dan

    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] With the exception of late autumn crops in the Jiangnan region that have not yet been harvested, the autumn harvest work across the country has been largely completed amidst the joyful celebration of a bumper harvest. Preliminary estimates indicate that this year's national production of raw grain is approximately 240 billion jin, an increase of 20 billion jin compared to last year, reaching 85.7% of the pre-war level; the production of ginned cotton is approximately 14 million dan, an increase of 5.2 million dan compared to last year, exceeding the pre-war average level by 20%, reaching 82.8% of the highest pre-war production. This year, the Northeast region has an 80% harvest, Rehe has increased production by 10% compared to last year, Liaoxi has increased production by 20%, and other provinces have also seen better harvests than last year, with the overall region's output exceeding last year by 19%. The five provinces of North China generally have an 80% harvest, with bumper harvests during the summer and autumn rainy seasons. Raw grain production is approximately 28.5 billion jin, reaching 91% of the pre-war level, and ginned cotton production is expected to reach over 5 million dan. In the Central and Southern region, except for some areas where production was reduced due to water accumulation or flooding, the harvest was generally bountiful. The region's increase in production also exceeded the original plan. Cotton yields were generally 100 to 130 jin of seed cotton per mu, with a total regional production of over 2.6 million dan. The Southwest region experienced a bumper harvest throughout, especially in Sichuan, where rice yields averaged five shi per mu, with a total regional raw grain production of approximately 39 billion jin. In the Northwest, except for some areas in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces that suffered from disasters and reduced production, the overall harvest was better than last year, and the task of increasing raw grain production by 330 million jin and ginned cotton production by over 1 million dan can be completed. In East China, except for a few areas where the harvest was poor due to water accumulation or flooding, the overall harvest exceeded last year. Sorghum yields in Shandong reached 200 to 250 jin per mu, and middle-season rice yields in Zhejiang increased by 10% to 20% compared to last year. The entire East China region produced approximately 56.9 billion jin of raw grain and over 3.8 million dan of ginned cotton. Grain and cotton production in various regions have exceeded the original planned increases, creating favorable conditions for achieving a fundamental improvement in the financial and economic situation.

    The bumper harvest has brought scenes of joy everywhere in the countryside, not only preliminarily improving the lives of farmers but also greatly encouraging their enthusiasm for production. Since the autumn harvest, farmers in various regions have been eagerly exchanging their harvested grain for agricultural tools, cloth, and daily necessities, thereby invigorating the rural economy and further enlivening the exchange between urban and rural areas. Since the autumn harvest, farmers in the Anyang Special District of Pingyuan Province have purchased over 200,000 pieces of agricultural implements, and Shanxian County alone has repaired and manufactured over 170 large carts. After the new cotton came on the market in August, all of the more than 10,000 waterwheels in the Handan Special District were sold out. In Junxian County, Pingyuan Province, over 330 waterwheels were loaned out in September alone. According to statistics from two districts in the suburbs of Chongqing, one-third of the farming households have added agricultural tools after the autumn harvest, and one-tenth have bought draft animals and fertilizers. Due to the increased purchasing power of farmers, industrial products have recently been selling well everywhere, greatly stimulating industrial production. Not only are daily necessities such as yarn, cloth, matches, and soap selling well, but other items such as bicycles are also selling briskly. In Handan City, 40 bicycles were sold in one day, and 2,400 dozens of flashlights were sold in one day. The lives of farmers in the Northeast have improved significantly, and their purchasing power has generally increased. According to statistics from the Liaoxi Provincial Department Store for nine months, a total of 440,000 jin of granulated sugar, 16,000 dozens of towels, and 85,000 pairs of rubber shoes were sold to farmers. From April to August, more than 17,000 bars of scented soap were sold, and some farmers even began to buy toothbrushes. To welcome the bumper harvest, farmers in Songjiang Province have been adding carts and buying horses, and repairing warehouses. For example, in only the first and second districts of Huanan County in the province, 260 large carts were purchased; Shuangcheng County purchased 272 large carts and repaired 623 old carts; Tonghe County manufactured 310 new carts, repaired 320 old threshing machines, and acquired 50 new threshing machines; and over 1,800 new warehouses were built in the Xubu District of Hulan. Encouraged by this year's bumper harvest, farmers in various regions have increased their enthusiasm for production, replenished their production tools, and are now enthusiastically carrying out autumn planting and autumn plowing work for next year's bumper harvest and a more prosperous life.

　　全国秋收大体完成粮棉产量均超过去年
    秋粮总产量达二千四百余亿斤棉花总产量达一千四百余万担
    【本报讯】目前除江南地区晚秋作物尚未收割外，全国范围的秋收工作，已在丰收的喜庆中大体完成。初步估计，今年全国约产原粮二千四百余亿斤，比去年增产二百亿斤，达战前水平的百分之八五点七；皮棉约产一千四百余万担，比去年增产五百二十万担，超过战前平均水平百分之二十，达战前最高产量的百分之八二点八。东北今年为八成半年景，热河比去年增产一成，辽西增产二成，其他省份收成也都超过去年，全区产量超过去年百分之十九。华北五省一般为八成年景，夏秋雨季丰收，原粮约产二百八十五亿斤，达战前水平百分之九十一，皮棉可产五百余万担。中南区除一部分因积水或水淹减产外，一般均属丰收，全区增产额也超过了原定计划，棉花一般每亩收籽棉一百至一百三十斤，全区可产二百六十余万担。西南全区丰收，特别是四川水稻，每亩平均收五石，全区约产原粮三百九十亿斤。西北除陕、甘两省部分地区受灾减产外，一般收成比去年好，可完成增产原粮三亿三千斤和皮棉一百余万担的任务。华东除少数地区因积水或水淹歉收外，一般收成超过去年，山东高粱每亩产二百到二百五十斤，浙江中稻比去年增产一成到二成，华东全区约产原粮五百六十九亿斤，皮棉三百八十余万担。各地粮棉均超过了原订增产计划，对争取财政经济情况的根本好转，创造了有利的条件。
    丰收使农村到处呈现了欢乐景象，不仅初步地改善了农民生活，同时也大大鼓舞了农民的生产情绪。秋收以来，各地农民纷纷以收获的粮米，换回农具、布匹和日常生活用品，农村经济因而顿形活跃，城乡交流也更加活泼起来。平原省安阳专区秋收以来农民增购农具二十余万件，单县仅大车就修制了一百七十多辆。八月份新花上市后，邯郸专区一万多辆水车已全部卖完。平原浚县九月份内贷出水车三百三十多辆。重庆郊区两个区的统计，有三分之一农户秋收后添置了农具，有十分之一买了耕畜和肥料。由于农民购买力的提高，工业产品近来到处均形畅销，大大刺激了工业生产。不仅纱布、火柴、肥皂等日用必需品销路日畅，其他如自行车，在邯郸市一天便卖了四十辆，手电筒一天卖出二千四百打。东北农民生活显著改善，农民购买力普遍提高，据辽西省百货公司九个月的统计，共卖给农民砂糖四十四万斤，手巾一万六千打，胶皮鞋八万五千双，四月到八月卖香皂一万七千多块，有些农民并开始买牙刷。松江省农民为了迎接丰收，纷纷添车买马，修理仓房，如该省桦南县仅一、二两区就买进大车二百六十台；双城全县买进大车二百七十二台，修理旧车六百二十三台；通河全县制新车三百一十台，修理旧打稻机三百二十台，新打稻机五十台；呼兰许卜区新修仓房一千八百多个。各地农民为今年的丰收所鼓舞，提高了生产热情，充实了生产工具，目下正为明年的丰收和生活的更加富裕而热烈地进行秋种秋耕工作。
