Xinhua News Agency, 1st. President Gottwald of the Czechoslovak Republic sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government of our country to congratulate our National Day. The text of the telegram is as follows: Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Beijing:

On the occasion of the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, please accept my heartfelt respect and congratulations in the name of myself and all the people of Czechoslovakia. The people of Czechoslovakia have watched the glorious achievements of your country with such joy and sympathy, just as they watched the victorious struggle of the Chinese people against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which was supported by the reactionary forces of the whole world. The founding of the People's Republic of China has infinitely consolidated the camp of peace and progress in the world. Under the leadership of the powerful Soviet Union, the working people of our two countries are firmly marching in this line. I wish you greater success in your efforts to finally liberate all the territory of your country and in the great construction of your country.

Gottwald
September 30, 1950

    值此中华人民共和国成立一周年之际，请接受以我个人及捷克斯洛伐克全体人民名义所表示的衷心的敬意与祝贺。捷克斯洛伐克人民以如此的欢欣鼓舞与同情，像注视中国人民同为全世界反动势力所支持的蒋介石匪帮所进行的胜利的斗争一样地注视着贵国人民辉煌的成就。中华人民共和国的成立无限巩固了全世界和平与进步阵营。在强大的苏联领导之下，我们两国的劳动人民在这一行列里坚定地行进着。祝您在最后解放贵国全部领土的努力中，在贵国伟大的建设中获得更大的成功。
