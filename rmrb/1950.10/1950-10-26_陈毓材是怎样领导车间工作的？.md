　　Chen Yucai's workshop is the assembly workshop of the Fifth Machine Factory.

　　He only became the workshop director in August 1949. He closely contacted the workers, was familiar with the technical abilities of every worker, and could appropriately allocate their work; also, because he was proficient in technology, he established the technical management system of the workshop; more importantly, he was good at improving labor organization and production organization according to production tasks, and establishing the workshop's responsibility system; therefore, all employees were able to consciously improve and enhance the workshop's work from the aspects of organization and system. He achieved significant results in completing the quantity and quality of products, reducing costs, and training technicians and cadres. Such a workshop created favorable conditions for improving the operation and management of the Fifth Machine Factory.

　　Proficient in technology, helping workers solve specific difficulties

　　Chen Yucai graduated from the Mechanical Engineering Department of Changchun University of Technology. He has been working in the assembly workshop for seven years. Seven years of field experience, coupled with theoretical knowledge from books, enabled him to skillfully master the assembly technology. He is familiar with the performance of various lathes, knows what method to use to prevent possible difficulties, and what method to use to ensure the precision of the lathe base.

　　When workers encounter technical difficulties, the workshop director can specifically help solve them. For example, when repairing a horizontal lathe, the task was almost impossible to complete because the transmission part of the main shaft—the figure-eight wheel—was missing, and no one knew how to design it. It was thanks to the design of the workshop director that this difficulty was overcome.

　　As a leader of the workshop, he can also foresee difficulties. For example, in July, a universal milling machine was test-assembled. This was a new task. The structure of the universal milling machine is particularly complex, and the precision requirements are very strict. In order to prepare the workers ideologically and technically to overcome the difficulties, the workshop leaders organized the group leaders and technically skilled old technicians in mid-June to analyze the performance and structure of the universal milling machine for them and explain the assembly methods.

　　Solving specific difficulties time and time again, the workshop leadership established a high prestige, and the work was able to proceed smoothly.

　　Familiar with the skills of each technician, appropriately allocating tasks, and enthusiastically cultivating and educating workers.

　　One of the characteristics of Chen Yucai's workshop is that every worker gets a job that matches his technical abilities. Chen Yucai has very close contact with the workers, and he is familiar with the technical abilities of the entire workshop's technicians, so the organization and allocation of labor appropriately take care of everyone's strengths. For example, when assembling a plain milling machine, he first selected skilled workers from each group to form a separate group for trial assembly, learned from the experience, and then strengthened another group. The Chu Zhongyun group in the workshop is full of young and energetic new workers, but their technical abilities are low. Chen Yucai, understanding this situation, equipped them with two old workers with strong technical skills. Therefore, in less than a month, the Chu Zhongyun group was cultivated into an advanced group with vitality, technology, and the ability to work hard, and collectively performed meritorious service.

　　He can consciously cultivate workers, help them continuously improve their technical level, thereby improving labor efficiency. For example, in order to cultivate and improve the independent leadership ability of the foremen, the responsibilities of the foremen were clearly defined. According to different situations, it was specifically stipulated which matters should be requested from the workshop director, which matters can be solved by the foreman himself first, and then reported to the director, and some matters are the responsibility of the foreman. In addition, he paid special attention to improving the technical knowledge of the foremen, helping foreman Wu Dexuan learn drawing, geometry, and trigonometry. With these specific helps, the four team leaders in the workshop are all very capable and have won the title of "Four Great Diamond Warriors." He paid close attention to the learning of apprentice technicians and apprentices. The first and second batches of apprentices have now been promoted to assistant craftsmen or craftsmen.

　　Strict labor discipline, with rewards and punishments, is an important factor in correctly organizing labor enthusiasm and maximizing labor efficiency. Chen Yucai's workshop does not neglect every instance that should be commended, nor does it relax any phenomenon that violates labor discipline.

　　Improve labor organization based on production tasks; correctly estimate labor capacity; grasp quotas and plans.

　　By flexibly changing labor organization and allocating labor according to different tasks, Chen Yucai's workshop was able to exceed tasks and improve product quality.

　　In January of this year, the production task was 30 spiral milling machines. Spiral milling machines can be assembled in groups. In order to implement assembly line operations and ensure the completion of the task, the leaders dismantled the original miscellaneous team and re-equipped a new group, divided it into two shifts with the original three groups; in each shift, one group did component assembly and the other group did final assembly. In this way, the two shifts can compete with each other, and production efficiency and quality have been improved. The February spiral milling machine production completed ten more units under this organizational form, exceeding the task.

　　In May, because sheet metal work decreased, the leaders promptly changed the sheet metal workers to fitters and established a component group specifically responsible for processing small parts, typing heads, and drilling large parts for the first, second, third, and fourth shifts. Consequently, the appearance of the small parts was unified and beautiful, the large drilling machine was not easily damaged, and several sets of tools were saved.

　　In addition to the leadership's ability to improve labor organization according to production tasks, effectively guaranteeing the completion of production tasks, another characteristic of Chen Yucai's workshop is: continuously studying business, being good at correctly estimating labor capacity and equipment capacity, and predicting possible situations in the production process to formulate production plans.

　　Chen Yucai often calculates the number of direct and indirect workers based on attendance statistics and the number of man-hours they spend assembling each lathe, mastering the labor situation. At the same time, based on working hour statistics, he calculates the total working hours of each shift (including the working hours required for each process of roughing, partial assembly, small assembly, final assembly, test run adjustment, and inspection and alignment), so that shifts with high working hours can learn advanced assembly methods from shifts with low working hours to shorten working hours, and then stipulates that a number slightly higher than the average working hours of the four shifts should be the standard assembly working hours for each lathe. In this way, he can skillfully grasp the plan and work progress.

　　Strengthen the preparatory work for workshop cost accounting and establish a workshop responsibility system

　　In order to avoid work stoppages due to waiting for materials and ensure the completion of production tasks on schedule, the factory accepted advanced Soviet production experience and formulated an engineering management responsibility system: all products entering the factory for processing must be registered by the engineers, and attention should be paid to mastering the completion deadline. At the beginning of the month, the engineers make component collection tables, outsourced component collection tables, and partial progress tables according to the production tasks, set component collection dates according to the assembly progress, and report the collection progress to the executive officer or technical director every day to avoid work stoppages during assembly due to the failure to supply components. All tools required for assembly must be carefully counted in advance, tabulated or drawn to order goods from external workshops or the management section. At the beginning of each month, the executive officer cooperates with the workshop director to set the production tasks and progress of each shift according to the production tasks given by the higher authorities, and urge the implementation of the plan and solve the difficulties encountered in it at any time. The statistician must prepare a monthly production man-hour statistics table every day. In order to facilitate the allocation of production tasks and labor allocation to each shift next month, three statistical tables are also prepared: the man-hours required for each part assembly, the total man-hours required to complete the assembly of the entire lathe, and the ratio of the man-hours completed by each team.

　　In order to ensure the timely supply of tools and materials and the economic use of them, a tool and material responsibility system has been formulated: the tool clerk shall prepare all tools and materials in full on the specified date according to the tool and material budget issued by the executive officer; and ensure quality. If it has not been received five days before the specified date, the tool clerk shall report to the director or executive officer in order to negotiate with the factory, department or supply and sales department to solve it. If the loss of work stoppage waiting for materials is caused by the tool clerk's negligence, the tool clerk shall be responsible. Common tool consumables are issued twice a month before the 25th according to the consumption quota. On the day before the end of the month, the user of the tool must truthfully report the sales, and if the consumption quota is exceeded, it must not continue to be used without the approval of the workshop director.

　　In order to ensure quality and improve product quality, a quality operation responsibility system (including technical operating procedures and technical responsibility system) has been established: each lathe is responsible for by the assembly team leader, and the workers must work according to his instructions and drawings. Each assembly team's product must be marked with a designated symbol to clarify responsibility. The technical director is fully responsible for the loss of product quality caused by the decision to modify, change drawings, replace materials, or use substitutes for parts. Before the transfer of each shift in the processing process and before the completion of the product inspection by the inspection department, the workshop must conduct strict inspections.

　　Diary system: Each foreman has a diary. The content of the diary is: number of attendance, work records, major temporary events in a shift, requests for instructions, opinions or suggestions on work.... Submit it to the workshop director before 10 o'clock every day. When the director reads it, he can solve the problem immediately. If it cannot be solved, he will summarize it and bring it to the factory's report meeting for research and resolution. A system of personal responsibility for each lathe: The assembly of each lathe is the responsibility of the assembly team leader (each assembly team has five or six people), who is responsible for controlling the production progress and assembly precision. Production reporting conference system: It is stipulated that the director, deputy director, branch secretary, trade union director, and foremen hold a production reporting meeting every noon to exchange the production execution of each shift, so that the leaders can specifically grasp the daily production situation and solve problems in a timely and rapid manner.

　　Achievements of Chen Yucai's Workshop

　　Chen Yucai's workshop overfulfilled the tasks for the first and second quarters and July ahead of schedule. The quality continues to improve, reaching 100% first-class products in May and June. In July, not only was the record of 100% first-class products maintained, but also the shortcomings in appearance quality were completely eliminated. Working hours are shortened and labor productivity is improved. Taking the fourth shift of the workshop as an example, the working hours per lathe were 256.4 in April, 115 in May, and 109.5 in June. Costs are also continuously reduced. For example, the assembly labor cost (including bonuses) of spiral milling machines in January, February, and March decreased from more than 6 million yuan to more than 4 million yuan, and the assembly labor cost (including bonuses) of plain milling machines in May and June gradually decreased from more than 19 million yuan to more than 10.04 million yuan. In addition, great achievements have been made in saving raw materials and training new cadres.

　　Now the experience of Chen Yucai's workshop is being studied and promoted in the workshops of various factories in Northeast China. (Reprinted from Northeast Daily)

　　陈毓材是怎样领导车间工作的？
    陈毓材车间是第五机器厂的装配车间。
    他在一九四九年八月才担任车间主任。他密切联系工人群众，熟悉每一个工友的技术能力，能适当分配他们工作；又由于他精通技术，建立起车间的技术管理制度；更重要的是他善于根据生产任务，来改善劳动组织和生产组织，建立车间的责任制度；所以全体职工能够自觉的从组织方面、制度方面不断地改进和提高车间的工作，在完成产品的数量、质量，降低成本，培养技工和干部方面，均获得了显著的成绩。这样的一个车间，对于改进机器五厂的经营管理工作创造了有利的条件。
    精通技术，帮助工友解决具体困难
    陈毓材系长春工业大学机械系毕业，已在装配车间工作七年，七年的现场经验加上书本的理论知识，使他熟练地掌握了装配的技术，他熟知各种床子的性能，知道用那一种方法来预防可能遇到的困难，用那一种方法来保证车床底精密度。
    工友们遇到了技术困难，车间主任能具体帮助解决。如修复卧旋时，因为少了主轴的传动部分——八字轮，又没有一个人会设计，几乎完不成任务。由于车间主任的设计，才克服了这个困难。
    作为一个车间的领导者，他还能预见困难，如七月试装万能铣，这是件新的工作，万能铣的构造特别复杂，精密度要求非常严格，为了让工友有思想准备，在技术上具备条件去克服困难，车间领导上就在六月中组织了工、组长和技术熟练的老技工，为他们分析万能铣的性能、构造，和讲解装配方法。
    这样一次又一次解决具体困难，车间领导就建立起很高的威信，工作也得以顺利地进行。
            熟悉每个技术工人的本领，恰当分配任务，热心培养和教育工友。
    陈毓材车间的特色之一，是每一个工人都得到与他技术能力相符的工作。陈毓材与工人的联系非常密切，他熟知全场技术工人的技术能力，因此劳动力的组织配备就恰当地照顾每人的特长。例如在装配平铣床时，他先把各组的熟练工人抽出来另成一组进行试装，吸取经验后，再加强另一组。该车间的初中云组全组都是些年青干活肯卖劲的新工友，但技术能力较低，陈毓材了解了这情况，就给另外配备两个技术强的老工友。因此不到一个月，初中云组就被培养成为有朝气、有技术而又能苦干的先进小组，集体立了功。
    他能有意识的培养工友，帮助他们不断提高技术水准，从而提高劳动效率。例如为了培养和提高工长的独立领导能力，明确规定了工长的职责，按不同情况，具体地规定了那些事情须向车间主任请示，那些事情可先由工长自行解决，然后再向主任汇报，而有些事情则由工长负责处理。除此以外，他又特别注意提高工长的技术知识，帮助工长吴德轩学绘图、几何、三角。在这些具体帮助下，该车间的四个班长能力都很强，获得“四大金刚”的称号。他对见习技术员和徒工的学习抓得很紧，一、二批学徒现都已升为帮工匠或工匠了。
    严格劳动纪律，有奖有罚，是正确地组织劳动热情，发挥劳动效率的重要因素。陈毓材车间不疏忽每一个应予表扬的实例，也不放松任何违犯劳动纪律的现象。
            根据生产任务，改善劳动组织；正确估计劳动能力，掌握定额和
    计划。
    按照不同任务，灵活地改变劳动组织，配备劳动力，使陈毓材车间能够超过任务并提高产品质量。
    今年一月份，生产任务是三十台螺旋铣。螺旋铣是可以分组按装的。为了实行流水作业，保证完成任务，当时领导上就将原来的一个杂项班拆散，重新配备了一个新的组，与原有的三个组，分成二个班；每个班里，一个组作部品装备，另一个组作总装配。这样一来，两个班还能互相竞赛，生产效率和质量都提高了。二月份的螺旋铣生产就是在这种组织形式下多完成了十台，超出了任务的。
    五月间，因为板金工作减少，领导上又及时地将板金工改为钳工，专成立一个部品组，将一、二、三、四班的小部件加工、打字头、大部件之钻孔等工作，都集中由它负责，因而使小部件的外形统一美观，大钻床也不容易受到损坏，还节省了好几套工具。
    除了领导上能根据生产任务来改善劳动组织，有力地保证了生产任务的完成外，陈毓材车间的另一个特点是：不断地钻研业务，善于正确估计劳动能力和设备能力，并预计生产过程中的可能情况来制订生产计划。
    陈毓材经常根据出勤统计数字，计算了直接工和间接工的人数，和装配每台床子时他们所花费的工数，掌握了劳动力情况。同时根据工时统计数字，计算出每班的总工时（内包括荒型加工、部分装配、小装配、总装配、试车调整、检查对表每一过程所需之工时），使工时数高的班向工时数低的班学习先进的装配方法，以缩短工时，然后规定以稍高于四个班平均工时的数字为每台床子的标准装配工时。这样他就能熟练地掌握计划和工作进度。
            加强车间成本计算的准备工作，建立车间责任制
    为避免停工待料与保证生产任务如期完成，该厂接受了先进的苏联生产经验，制订了工程管理责任制：一切入场加工产品，工务员均须登记，并注意掌握其加工完成期限。月初工务员按生产任务作出部件搜集表、外购件搜集表、部分进度表等，根据装配进度，定出部件搜集日期，每日须向执令者或技术主任作搜集进度报告，以免装配期间，因部件供应不上而停工。一切装配所需工具，事先须精密统计、造表或制图向外场或经理科订货。每月初执令者协同场主任根据上级所予之生产任务订出各班之生产任务及进度，且督促计划之推行与随时解决其中所遇困难。统计员须制出每天、每月的生产工时统计表。为便于分配下月各班之生产任务以及劳动力的配备，又制出各部分装配所需工时，全台床子装配完成所需之总工时与各班组完成工时之比率三种统计表。
    为保证工具物料供应及时与使用经济，制订了工具物料责任制度：工具员按执令者发下之工具材料预算单于指定日期王动设法将工具物料准备齐全；并保证质量。如距指定日期前五日，尚未领到时，工具员应向主任或执令者报告，以便向厂、部或供销科交涉解决。如因工具员疏忽大意未能及时报告而造成停工待料之损失，由工具员负责。常用工具消耗品于每月二十五日前分两次按消耗定额发放。月末前一日，领用工具者须据实报销，若有超过消耗定额时，非经场主任批准不得继续领用。
    为保证质量与提高产品质量订立了质量操作责任制（包括技术操作规程与技术责任制）：每台床子由装配小组长负责，工人须按其指示与图纸进行工作。各装配小组产品须按指定符号打刻字头，以明责任。凡部件决定改修、改图换料、代用而造成产品质量之损失，由技术主任负全责。在加工过程中各班之移交与产品完工后未经检查科检查之前，车间须进行严格检查。
    日记制度：工长每人都有一本日记，日记的内容是：出勤人数、工作记录、一班临时发生的大事、请示、对工作的意见或建议……。每天十点钟前交给车间主任，主任看时，能解决的立时批答，不能解决的，汇总后带到厂部的汇报会上研究解决。每一台床子专人负责制：每一台床子的装配都由装配小组长负责（每一个装配小组有五、六个人），由他掌握生产进度和装配的精密度。生产汇报会议制：规定每天中午，由正副主任、支书、工会主任、工长，举行生产汇报会议，交换各班生产执行情况，使领导上能具体掌握每天的生产情况，及时而迅速的解决问题。
    陈毓材车间的成绩
    陈毓材车间第一、二季度和七月份任务都超额提前完成。质量不断提高，到五、六月份已达百分之百的一级品，七月份不仅保持百分之百一级品的纪录，而且完全消灭了外观质量上的缺点。工时缩短，劳动生产率提高，以该车间第四班为例，每台车床工时在四月份是二五六点四，五月份是一一五，六月份是一○九点五。成本也不断降低，例如一、二、三月份螺旋铣床的装配人工成本（包括奖金）由六百余万元降至四百余万元，五、六月份平铣床的装配人工成本（包括奖金）由一千九百余万元渐降至一千零四十余万元。此外在节省原材料方面，培养新的干部方面，都收到了很大的成绩。
    现在陈毓材车间的经验，正在东北各工厂的车间中研究推广。（转载东北日报）
