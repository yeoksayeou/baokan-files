Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 7th. The Hunan Branch of the People's Bank of China is vigorously carrying out lending business to support production and organize the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas through lending. In the first half of this year, the bank's lending work did not achieve the desired results due to an unclear direction and some relief-oriented views on loans to industry and commerce. After the bank convened an enlarged meeting of its administrative staff in July and determined that the focus of lending should be on supporting production, organizing the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and processing and marketing export goods, the lending work in various places has made significant progress. At the end of August, the balance of loans in the province increased by 63% compared with the end of July. In Changsha City, more than 2,793,900 jin of rice and 298,800 jin of paddy rice were exported to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin and other places through exchange settlement in August, and more than 29,000 dan of paddy rice were purchased at the place of origin through purchase certificates. The vegetable oil industry, thanks to a loan of 4.6 billion, purchased 11,000 dan of tung oil. In addition, 6,750 dan of tung oil were exported through export exchange settlement. Yiyang Lanxi is one of the native product areas near the lake. After the People's Bank of China focused on lending, more than 13,900 bolts of native cloth and 3,300 shi of rice were exported in August. Yueyang is a fish-producing area near the lake, with an annual output of more than one million jin of fish. With the issuance of fishery production loans by the county sub-branch, the quantity of fish production has also increased. In order to understand the market situation and integrate lending work more closely with production, the bank has successively convened symposiums for the grain, machinery, oil and salt, cotton yarn, egg products, and firecracker industries in Changsha City since August to strengthen the planning of loans.

    开展放款业务组织城乡贸易
    【新华社长沙七日电】中国人民银行湖南省分行大力开展放款业务，扶助生产，并通过放款来组织城乡物资交流。该行今年上半年放款工作，因方针不十分明确，对工商业贷款存在一些救济观点，致贷款未能收到应有的作用。该行于七月间召开扩大行务会议，确定放款以扶助生产，组织城乡物资交流及出口外销物资的加工运销为重点后，各地贷款工作都有了显著的进展。全省八月底放款余额较七月底增加了百分之六十三。长沙市八月份通过押汇输出至上海、广州、天津等地的大米达二百七十九万三千九百余市斤，稻二十九万八千八百市斤，通过购买证在产地收购的稻谷达二万九千余担。植物油业由于得到放款四十六亿，收购桐油达一万一千担。此外，又通过出口押汇输出桐油六千七百五十担。益阳兰溪为滨湖土产区之一，经人民银行重点放款后，八月份输出土布一万三千九百余匹，大米三千三百市石。岳阳为滨湖产鱼区，年产鱼类百余万斤，经该县支行发放渔业生产贷款，鱼产数量也见增加。为着了解市场情况，使放款工作更加紧密地与生产相结合，该行自八月份起在长沙市即陆续召集粮食、机器、油盐、花纱、蛋品、鞭炮等行业举行座谈会，以加强贷款的计划性。
