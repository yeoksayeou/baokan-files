[Reported by this newspaper] During the rectification campaign in various counties of the Longyan Special District in Fujian Province, the relationship between the Party and the masses has been improved, creating a new atmosphere within and outside the Party. After the enlarged rectification meeting of the District Committee in early August, various counties have convened enlarged county Party committee meetings, county people's representative conferences, and county peasant representative conferences to inspect work and work styles. According to statistics from Longyan, Shanghang, and Yongding counties, nearly a thousand cadres (including main cadres at the county, district, and village levels, as well as district financial and grain affairs cadres) have participated in rectification meetings for rectification. If the cadres and representatives who participated in the inspection of work and cadre work styles at the People's Representative Conferences and Peasant Representative Conferences are added, the total number in the three counties is around three thousand.

At various meetings, county and district cadres have generally carried out criticism and self-criticism, exposing bureaucratic and commandist work styles, as well as certain corrupt and degenerate thoughts. After the exposure of mistakes, comrades who made mistakes were determined to correct them in future practical work. Cadres generally improved their understanding and confidence in their work. After the district and township cadres sorted out their thoughts, they expressed their determination to correct their mistakes and ensure that their work is done well. Village cadres proposed taking the lead in paying public grain. The People's Representative Conferences in Longyan, Yongding, and Shanghang counties were all very successful. At the meetings, representatives were deeply moved after listening to the serious self-examinations of the county heads and other county and district cadres. They said, "Only a government that truly works for the people can conduct such self-criticism." At the People's Representative Conference in Longyan County, representatives said, "Many problems are not only the responsibility of the government, but also the responsibility of us representatives." The People's Representative Conference in the county also fully promoted democracy to discuss the summer tax collection work, and more than 80% of the representatives expressed their opinions. They stated, "If we fail to complete the task, we will all come and conduct self-criticism next time."

Because the meetings were successful, a new atmosphere began to grow within and outside the Party. Cadres generally strengthened their mass viewpoint and policy viewpoint. Village cadres also generally knew that they should handle affairs in accordance with policies. Cadres clarified many unclear issues, and their sense of responsibility for their work generally improved.
