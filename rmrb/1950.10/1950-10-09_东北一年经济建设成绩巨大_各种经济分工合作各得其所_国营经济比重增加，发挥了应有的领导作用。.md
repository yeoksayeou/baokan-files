Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 6th. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, the people of Northeast China have achieved great successes in economic construction over the past year. Over the past year, the people of Northeast China, especially the working class, have engaged in selfless and heroic labor. Industrial cadres have been dedicated to research, and technical personnel have worked diligently, with the help of the noble friendship of Soviet experts, constantly overcoming difficulties such as a lack of funds, equipment, technology, cadres, and especially experience. This has enabled the economic construction of Northeast China to advance not slowly, but at a rapid pace.

State-owned industry exceeds plan; costs of major products reduced

In terms of industrial production, according to the Northeast People's Government's 1950 plan, the total value of industrial production this year should reach 193 percent of last year's. The plan for the first half of the year was to complete 41.7 percent of the annual plan, but it actually completed 44.1 percent. In terms of labor productivity, the first half of this year exceeded the plan by 14.1 percent. At the same time, product costs are constantly decreasing. Taking several major products as examples: in the first quarter of this year, coal decreased by 10.56 percent, steel by 7.9 percent, chemicals by 12.18 percent, paper by 9.53 percent, and textiles by 7.4 percent.

Railway transportation completed 54.1 percent of the annual plan in the first half of the year.

Agriculture exceeds plan by 750,000 tons; unit yield exceeds 1943

After the land reform, farmers were liberated from the feudal land system, resulting in an unprecedented surge in production enthusiasm. This year's agricultural production plan, including grain production in eastern Inner Mongolia, is 18 million tons. According to surveys and reports from various provinces, it may exceed the plan by 750,000 tons. This year, the average yield per hectare may exceed that of 1943 by 204 jin, exceeding this year's planned yield by 132 jin.

Industrial investment this year is planned to be two and a half times that of last year, and the actual investment in the first half of the year accounted for 50.3 percent of the total for the year.

With the development of industry and agriculture, state-owned commerce has also developed greatly. Over the past year, state-owned commercial institutions have marketed 67 percent of farmers' commodity grain, 42 percent of sideline products, and 118 trillion yuan worth of state-owned products. In terms of supply, it has solved 80 percent of the people's needs for cotton cloth, 90 percent of their needs for edible salt, and 71 percent of their needs for coal, and has supplied the raw materials necessary for industry and the food for urban residents. State-owned commerce in the Northeast region, including wholesale to cooperatives and private merchants, accounts for approximately 44 percent of the total value of goods needed by society.

At the same time, cooperatives have also developed greatly. By June of this year, there were more than 11,600 cooperatives, with cooperatives established in 32 percent of administrative villages, with 9.68 million members, accounting for 24 percent of the population of Northeast China. Funds in June of this year increased by 76 percent compared to December of last year; total retail sales were 260 percent of those in December of last year.

Private industry and commerce have seen significant development

Due to the development of the state-owned economy and agriculture, private industry and commerce have also seen significant development. Taking Shenyang City as an example: the number of private factories in June of this year increased by 8.83 percent compared to December of last year; capital increased by 87.6 percent; employees increased by 41.85 percent; and the total value of production in the six months of this year increased by 15.3 percent compared to the entire year of last year. Although the number of private commercial establishments has decreased slightly compared to last year due to the shift to industry and other reasons, capital in June of this year increased by 18.8 percent compared to December of last year, and the trade volume in the six months of this year accounted for 81.8 percent of the trade volume for the entire year of last year. This illustrates the normal development of commerce, that is, commerce that develops properly is that which is needed by the people, while commerce that is unnecessary is transformed, and speculative commerce is reduced. The People's Government has helped private industrial and commercial enterprises solve difficulties such as raw materials and sales channels, and has appropriately adjusted labor-management relations in order to support the development of legitimate private industry and commerce. The city has 25 major industries that have signed labor-management collective contracts, so that labor disputes in December of last year were 113 cases, while in April of this year they were reduced to 45 cases.

From the above facts, it can be seen that Article 26 of the Common Program, which stipulates that "various social and economic components, under the leadership of the state-owned economy, cooperate in the division of labor, each fulfilling its role, to promote the development of the entire social economy," has been implemented by the Northeast People's Government in restoring and developing the people's economic undertakings.

Workers' wages increase, farmers' lives improve; cultural, educational, health, and publishing undertakings are developing rapidly

With the development of economic construction, people's lives are gradually improving. Since the beginning of this year, prices have stabilized. After workers' salaries were changed to the eight-grade wage system in April of this year, they increased by an average of 8 percent compared to December of last year, and technical personnel increased by an average of 38.9 percent. In addition, the actual expenditure of the state for labor insurance and welfare undertakings for employees, including medical care, culture and education, safety facilities, and health care, accounts for approximately 18 percent of the total wages, which is not included above. Farmers' lives have also improved significantly. According to a survey of a typical village in Keshan, the purchasing power of farmers per household was 100 two years ago, 136 last year, and 263 this year. At present, except for some disaster areas in Rehe and western Liaoning, many people in rural areas are buying carts and horses, opening up new wasteland, and constantly expanding production. Most farmers' families have new clothes and quilts, strong livestock, and flocks of pigs and chickens, and everywhere you can see the construction of houses, the establishment of schools, and the improvement of sanitation, presenting a new scene of prosperity for both people and wealth.

As Chairman Mao said: "With the advent of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear.‚Äù The cultural demands of the people of Northeast China are growing day by day. There are currently 16 universities and colleges in Northeast China, with more than 15,700 students; there are currently 12.7 percent more middle schools than last year, 38 percent more students than last year, and 46 percent more teachers than last year; there are now more than 5,000 students in worker-peasant middle schools and worker-peasant classes, which did not exist last year. There are currently 33,807 primary schools, with 4,576,111 students. Last winter, there were 94 percent more winter schools in rural areas than the year before; the number of people attending winter schools increased by 245 percent compared to the year before; according to extremely incomplete statistics, there are currently 3,874 workers' cultural night schools, with 297,096 students. The publishing industry in Northeast China has also experienced unprecedented development. In the past six months alone, the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore has published more than 14.26 million copies of various textbooks, more than 4.89 million copies of various books, and more than 2.43 million copies of various magazines. In terms of mass art, in the drama category alone, there are more than 7,000 amateur drama troupes in Northeast China, with a total of more than 200,000 people participating. The above-mentioned cultural construction is closely coordinated with economic construction and serves its needs.

People's representative conferences at all levels have played a huge role in economic construction, and the development of economic construction has also promoted the development of the masses' political enthusiasm and democratic life. Five of the six provinces in Northeast China have held people's representative conferences and, in accordance with the provisions of the Common Program, exercised the functions and powers of the people's congress; 56 cities (including county towns with a population of more than 30,000) have held two to five conferences, and some cities have exercised the functions and powers of the people's congress; 167 counties have generally held two conferences, and 15 counties have exercised the functions and powers of the people's congress; 84.6 percent of 1,877 districts have held conferences; 71.5 percent of 31,467 villages have held conferences. At these people's representative conferences, democracy was promoted, the principles and tasks of developing production were implemented, and many major issues in urban and rural production were resolved, such as mobilizing the masses for production movements, adjusting public-private relations and labor-management relations, promoting urban-rural exchanges, and adjusting the people's burdens, etc.

The above is a summary of the main achievements of economic construction in the Northeast region over the past year.
