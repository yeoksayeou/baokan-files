Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 6th. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, the people of Northeast China have achieved great successes in economic construction over the past year. Over the past year, the people of Northeast China, especially the working class, have engaged in selfless and heroic labor. Industrial cadres have been dedicated to research, and technical personnel have worked diligently, with the help of the noble friendship of Soviet experts, constantly overcoming difficulties such as a lack of funds, equipment, technology, cadres, and especially experience. This has enabled the economic construction of Northeast China to advance not slowly, but at a rapid pace.

State-owned industry exceeds plan; costs of major products reduced

In terms of industrial production, according to the Northeast People's Government's 1950 plan, the total value of industrial production this year should reach 193 percent of last year's. The plan for the first half of the year was to complete 41.7 percent of the annual plan, but it actually completed 44.1 percent. In terms of labor productivity, the first half of this year exceeded the plan by 14.1 percent. At the same time, product costs are constantly decreasing. Taking several major products as examples: in the first quarter of this year, coal decreased by 10.56 percent, steel by 7.9 percent, chemicals by 12.18 percent, paper by 9.53 percent, and textiles by 7.4 percent.

Railway transportation completed 54.1 percent of the annual plan in the first half of the year.

Agriculture exceeds plan by 750,000 tons; unit yield exceeds 1943

After the land reform, farmers were liberated from the feudal land system, resulting in an unprecedented surge in production enthusiasm. This year's agricultural production plan, including grain production in eastern Inner Mongolia, is 18 million tons. According to surveys and reports from various provinces, it may exceed the plan by 750,000 tons. This year, the average yield per hectare may exceed that of 1943 by 204 jin, exceeding this year's planned yield by 132 jin.

Industrial investment this year is planned to be two and a half times that of last year, and the actual investment in the first half of the year accounted for 50.3 percent of the total for the year.

With the development of industry and agriculture, state-owned commerce has also developed greatly. Over the past year, state-owned commercial institutions have marketed 67 percent of farmers' commodity grain, 42 percent of sideline products, and 118 trillion yuan worth of state-owned products. In terms of supply, it has solved 80 percent of the people's needs for cotton cloth, 90 percent of their needs for edible salt, and 71 percent of their needs for coal, and has supplied the raw materials necessary for industry and the food for urban residents. State-owned commerce in the Northeast region, including wholesale to cooperatives and private merchants, accounts for approximately 44 percent of the total value of goods needed by society.

At the same time, cooperatives have also developed greatly. By June of this year, there were more than 11,600 cooperatives, with cooperatives established in 32 percent of administrative villages, with 9.68 million members, accounting for 24 percent of the population of Northeast China. Funds in June of this year increased by 76 percent compared to December of last year; total retail sales were 260 percent of those in December of last year.

Private industry and commerce have seen significant development

Due to the development of the state-owned economy and agriculture, private industry and commerce have also seen significant development. Taking Shenyang City as an example: the number of private factories in June of this year increased by 8.83 percent compared to December of last year; capital increased by 87.6 percent; employees increased by 41.85 percent; and the total value of production in the six months of this year increased by 15.3 percent compared to the entire year of last year. Although the number of private commercial establishments has decreased slightly compared to last year due to the shift to industry and other reasons, capital in June of this year increased by 18.8 percent compared to December of last year, and the trade volume in the six months of this year accounted for 81.8 percent of the trade volume for the entire year of last year. This illustrates the normal development of commerce, that is, commerce that develops properly is that which is needed by the people, while commerce that is unnecessary is transformed, and speculative commerce is reduced. The People's Government has helped private industrial and commercial enterprises solve difficulties such as raw materials and sales channels, and has appropriately adjusted labor-management relations in order to support the development of legitimate private industry and commerce. The city has 25 major industries that have signed labor-management collective contracts, so that labor disputes in December of last year were 113 cases, while in April of this year they were reduced to 45 cases.

From the above facts, it can be seen that Article 26 of the Common Program, which stipulates that "various social and economic components, under the leadership of the state-owned economy, cooperate in the division of labor, each fulfilling its role, to promote the development of the entire social economy," has been implemented by the Northeast People's Government in restoring and developing the people's economic undertakings.

Workers' wages increase, farmers' lives improve; cultural, educational, health, and publishing undertakings are developing rapidly

With the development of economic construction, people's lives are gradually improving. Since the beginning of this year, prices have stabilized. After workers' salaries were changed to the eight-grade wage system in April of this year, they increased by an average of 8 percent compared to December of last year, and technical personnel increased by an average of 38.9 percent. In addition, the actual expenditure of the state for labor insurance and welfare undertakings for employees, including medical care, culture and education, safety facilities, and health care, accounts for approximately 18 percent of the total wages, which is not included above. Farmers' lives have also improved significantly. According to a survey of a typical village in Keshan, the purchasing power of farmers per household was 100 two years ago, 136 last year, and 263 this year. At present, except for some disaster areas in Rehe and western Liaoning, many people in rural areas are buying carts and horses, opening up new wasteland, and constantly expanding production. Most farmers' families have new clothes and quilts, strong livestock, and flocks of pigs and chickens, and everywhere you can see the construction of houses, the establishment of schools, and the improvement of sanitation, presenting a new scene of prosperity for both people and wealth.

As Chairman Mao said: "With the advent of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear.” The cultural demands of the people of Northeast China are growing day by day. There are currently 16 universities and colleges in Northeast China, with more than 15,700 students; there are currently 12.7 percent more middle schools than last year, 38 percent more students than last year, and 46 percent more teachers than last year; there are now more than 5,000 students in worker-peasant middle schools and worker-peasant classes, which did not exist last year. There are currently 33,807 primary schools, with 4,576,111 students. Last winter, there were 94 percent more winter schools in rural areas than the year before; the number of people attending winter schools increased by 245 percent compared to the year before; according to extremely incomplete statistics, there are currently 3,874 workers' cultural night schools, with 297,096 students. The publishing industry in Northeast China has also experienced unprecedented development. In the past six months alone, the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore has published more than 14.26 million copies of various textbooks, more than 4.89 million copies of various books, and more than 2.43 million copies of various magazines. In terms of mass art, in the drama category alone, there are more than 7,000 amateur drama troupes in Northeast China, with a total of more than 200,000 people participating. The above-mentioned cultural construction is closely coordinated with economic construction and serves its needs.

People's representative conferences at all levels have played a huge role in economic construction, and the development of economic construction has also promoted the development of the masses' political enthusiasm and democratic life. Five of the six provinces in Northeast China have held people's representative conferences and, in accordance with the provisions of the Common Program, exercised the functions and powers of the people's congress; 56 cities (including county towns with a population of more than 30,000) have held two to five conferences, and some cities have exercised the functions and powers of the people's congress; 167 counties have generally held two conferences, and 15 counties have exercised the functions and powers of the people's congress; 84.6 percent of 1,877 districts have held conferences; 71.5 percent of 31,467 villages have held conferences. At these people's representative conferences, democracy was promoted, the principles and tasks of developing production were implemented, and many major issues in urban and rural production were resolved, such as mobilizing the masses for production movements, adjusting public-private relations and labor-management relations, promoting urban-rural exchanges, and adjusting the people's burdens, etc.

The above is a summary of the main achievements of economic construction in the Northeast region over the past year.

　　东北一年经济建设成绩巨大
    各种经济分工合作各得其所
    国营经济比重增加，发挥了应有的领导作用。
    【新华社沈阳六日电】东北人民在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，在过去的一年里，在经济建设上获得了很大的成就。一年来，东北人民特别是工人阶级忘我的英勇劳动，工业干部的钻研与技术人员的努力并得到苏联专家崇高友谊的帮助，不断克服缺乏资金、缺乏装备、缺乏技术、缺乏干部，特别是缺乏经验的困难。使东北经济建设不是以很慢而是以很快的速度在前进着。
    国营工业超过计划  主要产品成本降低
    工业生产方面，按照东北人民政府一九五○年的计划，今年工业生产总值要达到去年的百分之一九三，今年上半年计划完成全年的百分之四一点七，实际完成了全年计划的百分之四四点一。以劳动生产率来看，今年上半年超过计划百分之十四点一。同时产品成本在不断降低，以几种主要产品为例：今年第一季煤炭类降低百分之十点五六，钢铁类降低百分之七点九，化工类降低百分之十二点一八，纸张类降低百分之九点五三，纺织类降低百分之七点四。
    铁路运输，上半年完成了全年计划百分之五四点一。
    农业超过计划七十五万吨  单位产量超过一九四三年
    经过土地改革之后，农民从封建土地制度下解放出来，出现了空前高涨的生产积极性。农业生产今年计划连内蒙东部地区共产粮一千八百万吨，根据调查和各省报告，可能超过计划七十五万吨。今年一垧地平均产量可能比一九四三年超出二百零四斤，比今年计划产量超出一三二斤。
    工业投资今年计划为去年之两倍半，上半年实际投入了全年的百分之五十点三。
    随着工业与农业的发展，国家商业也有了很大的发展，一年来国营商业机构推销了农民商品粮食的百分之六十七，副业产品的百分之四十二，推销国营产品十一万八千亿。在供给方面，解决了人民纱布需要量的百分之八十，食盐需要量的百分之九十，煤炭需要量的百分之七十一，并供给了工业必需的原材料与城市人民的食粮。国营商业在东北区内供给社会需要的商品包括批发给合作社与私商的在内，约占社会需要的全部商品总额的百分之四十四。
    同时合作社也有了很大发展，到今年六月已有一万一千六百多处，百分之三十二的行政村都建立了合作社，社员九百六十八万人，占东北人口的百分之二十四；资金到今年六月比去年十二月增加百分之七十六；零售总值为去年十二月的百分之二百六十。
    私营工商业有显著发展
    由于国营经济和农业的发展，私营工商业也有了显著发展，以沈阳市为例：私营工厂家数今年六月比去年十二月增加百分之八点八三；资金增加百分之八十七点六；职工增加百分之四十一点八五；生产总值今年六个月比去年全年增加百分之十五点三。私营商业的家数因转向工业等原因虽较去年略有减少，但资金在今年六月较去年十二月增加百分之十八点八，今年六个月的贸易额占去年全年贸易额的百分之八十一点八。这说明了商业正常发展的状况，即正当商业发展了，为人民所不需要的商业转业了，而投机商业则减少了。人民政府为扶助正当私人工商业的发展，曾帮助他们解决了原料、销路等困难，并适当调整了劳资关系。全市有二十五个主要行业签订了劳资集体合同，因而劳资争议去年十二月份为一一三件，而今年四月份则减为四十五件。
    从上面的事实中，可以看出：共同纲领第二十六条所规定的“各种社会经济成份在国营经济领导之下，分工合作，各得其所，以促进整个社会经济之发展”。已为东北人民政府在恢复与发展人民经济事业中所贯彻。
    工人工资增加，农民生活改善  文教、卫生、出版事业日益发展
    随着经济建设的发展，人民的生活正在逐步提高。今年以来，物价稳定。工人薪金今年四月改为八级工资制后，比去年十二月平均提高百分之八，技术人员则平均提高百分之三十八点九。此外，国家为职工支出连医药、文教、安全设施、卫生等费在内的劳保福利事业费的实际支出，约占工薪总数百分之十八，尚不包括在内。农民生活也有显著的提高，据克山典型村调查，农民每户购买力，前年为一○○，去年为一三六，今年为二六三。目前农村除热河辽西部分灾区外，很多人民添车买马，新开荒地，不断扩大生产，大多数农户家中，衣被一新，耕畜肥壮，猪鸡成群，而且到处可以看到建筑房屋，兴办学校，改进卫生，呈现人财两旺的新景象。
    正如毛主席所说：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”东北人民的文化要求正在日益增长。东北现有高等学校十六所，学生一万五千七百余人；现有中学比去年增加百分之十二点七，学生比去年增加百分之三十八，教师比去年增加百分之四十六；现在工农中学及工农班学生有五千余人，这是去年所没有的。现有小学三三、八○七所，学生四、五七六、一一一人。去冬农村冬学比前年增加百分之九十四；上冬学人数比前年增加百分之二四五，工人文化夜校，据极不完全统计，现有三、八七四处，学生二九七、○九六名。东北的出版事业亦有了空前的发展，仅最近半年间东北新华书店，就已出版各种教科书一千四百二十六万余册，各种书籍四百八十九万余册，各种杂志二百四十三万余册。在群众文艺方面仅戏剧一项，全东北即有业余剧团七千多个，参加的群众共达二十余万人。上述文化建设是紧紧配合着经济建设进行并为它的需要而服务的。
    各级各界人民代表会议对于经济建设工作发挥了巨大的作用，而经济建设的发展，同时也促进了群众政治积极性与民主生活的发展。东北六省有五省开过人民代表会议，并按共同纲领的规定，代行了人民代表大会的职权，五十六个城市（包括三万人口以上的县城）均开过两次到五次，部分城市并代行了人民代表大会的职权；一六七个县已普遍开过两次，有十五个县代行了人民代表大会职权；一、八七七个区中有百分之八四点六开过；三一、四六七个村中有百分之七一点五开过。在这些人民代表会议上，发扬了民主，贯彻了发展生产的方针和任务，解决了城乡生产中许多重大问题，如发动群众生产运动、调整公私关系和劳资关系、促进城乡交流和调整人民负担等等。
    以上所述，就是一年来东北地区实施经济建设的主要成就。
