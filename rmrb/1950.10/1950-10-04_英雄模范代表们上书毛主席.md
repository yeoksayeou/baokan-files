Heroic Model Representatives Write to Chairman Mao
[By Our Newspaper] The heroic model representatives attending the National Combat Heroes Representative Conference and the Worker-Peasant-Soldier Labor Model Representative Conference wrote letters to Chairman Mao to pay their respects, reporting on their past production situations and guaranteeing that they would work harder in their respective positions to better complete their tasks in the future. Below are some original letters or summaries of original letters.

Ma Chunyu, Combat Hero of the Cavalry of the Northeast Military Region
Guarantee to Accept and Complete All Arduous Tasks

In his letter to Chairman Mao, cavalry combat hero Ma Chunyu said:

I represent all the commanders and fighters of our division to extend our greetings to you.

What you said is the guiding star for all our future work. I guarantee to convey it to every soldier and let them remember it firmly. Although we are engaged in production, everyone also recognizes the crimes of American imperialist aggression. If it dares to prevent us from liberating Taiwan and Tibet, we ask you to entrust all arduous and great tasks to our cavalry. We are sure we can defeat the invaders. We resolutely support the Korean people and defend lasting world peace!

I swear to you: I am willing to shed the last drop of my blood for the motherland to complete the glorious and great task and always be your good soldier!

Liang Jun, Northeast Labor Model and Female Tractor Team Leader
Report on the Development and Growth of the Mengya School

Liang Jun, the first female tractor driver in New China, said in her letter:

Chairman Mao: I am studying at the Mengya School in Dedu County, Heilongjiang Province. I am the captain of the agricultural machinery department's female tractor team. My name is Liang Jun.

This school was founded by a group of poor children who had not attended school in the past or had very little schooling. At the time of its establishment, there were only fifty students, five or six tables, a few hoes and iron shovels, and three brooms. The food they ate was moldy corn grits (broken corn), and radish strips boiled in soup. At that time, we cooked our own meals, chopped firewood, cultivated land, and pulled plows. In winter, in October, it was very cold. In order to buy vehicles and horses, the students organized themselves to chop firewood in the mountains. Their hands and feet were frozen. In ten days, they chopped 30,000 bundles of firewood and exchanged them for three horses and one cart, preparing for production next year.

In 1948, I and two other male classmates went to learn how to drive a tractor. We overcame many difficulties and learned simple driving and general skills in two months. After graduation, the government gave us four tractors, and we returned to Mengya School. In order to expand production and enable students to learn more, the school sent fifteen students and the three of us to establish a tractor team, and from then on, we began reclamation work. In our efforts to explore, we overcame the difficulties of immature technology. By overcoming the difficulties of insufficient technology and the use of fuel, we reclaimed 500 hectares of wasteland and planted 100 hectares of land. In the autumn, our fifty-odd students harvested the crops on the one hand and built houses on the other, preparing for the winter (the school was originally located in Dedu County, but later, in order to expand production, it moved to a barren hill fifteen miles away from Dedu County. At the beginning, we set up a few small shacks to live in temporarily). When winter came, we lived in the houses we built ourselves, ate the grain we grew, and began political, cultural, and technical studies.

In 1949, the government gave us five more machines. We planted all the land we had reclaimed last year and reclaimed another 1,000 hectares of wasteland. The number of tractor drivers also increased. This year, we planted all 1,500 hectares of land. On June 3rd, the female tractor team was established. They are very active in their work and study. When I came to attend the National Worker-Peasant-Soldier Labor Model Representative Conference, they told me to extend their greetings to Chairman Mao on their behalf, and all the students and teachers extended their greetings to Chairman Mao. And they told Chairman Mao: In the school led by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we earnestly study political, cultural, and scientific knowledge. Tractor drivers enthusiastically drive tractors and learn modern tractor and agricultural technology, developing the Great Northern Wilderness of the Northeast.

Chairman Mao: Our lives are much better than before, and our family property has also increased. Now we have 1,500 hectares of land reclaimed by our own hands, 100 houses, a flour mill, an oil mill, an iron factory, a small clothing factory, eighty horses, twelve carts, three cars, ten tractors, eighteen pieces of agricultural implements, and five dairy cows. Students often drink milk in winter. We can eat noodles every day, and pork is often eaten, and life has improved. Originally there were more than fifty students, now there are three hundred and twenty, twelve or thirteen teachers, and quite a few other staff members. This year, we are also firing bricks to prepare to build brick houses next year. Chairman Mao: You say how good our lives are!

Respected Chairman Mao: We, this group of poor children, can live such a happy life, all thanks to the Communist Party and you, Chairman Mao. We will definitely work hard in the future to build the school better, and our lives will be better.

Lu Xingwen and Others, Northeast Postal and Telecommunications Labor Models
Resolutely Implement the Responsibility System to Eliminate Errors

The letter from Lu Xingwen, Liu Changgui, and Wang Weibin, representatives of Northeast Postal and Telecommunications Industry Labor Models, said: Only under the regime led by the working class can such a National Worker-Peasant-Soldier Labor Model Representative Conference be held, so we are particularly grateful to the Party and you for your leadership and encouragement. In order to celebrate this great conference and the arrival of the first National Day, we must take practical actions in our work—the postal and telecommunications industry—to implement the responsibility system, reduce obstacles, eliminate errors, and guarantee the completion of the glorious tasks assigned to us by our superiors, and resolutely support lasting world peace, swear to oppose the American imperialist war of aggression, and support our People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and Tibet as soon as possible, and strive to build a free, happy, and prosperous New China!

Chen Shude, Qingdao Textile Female Worker Labor Model Explains
My Achievements Are Due to Chairman Mao's Leadership

Chen Shude, Qingdao Industrial Labor Model Representative and Textile Female Worker Labor Model, first extended her respects on behalf of the female textile workers of Qingdao in her letter. The letter said:

In February this year, bandit planes bombed Shanghai. The higher authorities called on us to rush to produce 20-count yarn to stabilize prices. We accepted the Sunday plus night shift, two-shift work system of 22 hours, but later bandit planes came to Qingdao to make trouble, we temporarily changed the day shift time, but by the end of April we still completed the production task. During this period, my home was more than ten miles away from the factory, and I was never late, left early, or stopped working. I also united and persuaded some young sisters.

In April, the higher authorities called on us to correct production deviations, organize competitions to welcome Red May, and demanded to reduce costs and complete financial tasks. I promptly helped the younger sisters to learn how to improve raw material methods, try to eliminate empty spindles, strengthen cleaning work, reduce roving, and unite the car workers, so that after the competition in the Third Factory, the cost was reduced by 4% or 5%.

Why can I do this? This is inseparable from your leadership. You liberated us, raised us from slaves to masters, your correct decision to take over the "three nothings" principle guaranteed our lives; you pointed out the road of mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and internal and external exchanges, supported our factory to start work, you also educated cadres to follow the mass line, and solved all the difficulties in our work; you used collective heroism to improve our production enthusiasm. In short, everything is inseparable from your leadership. I must study politics and technology even harder in the future, so that under your leadership, I can work harder for the construction of New China!

All the Representatives of Agricultural Labor Models in Shanxi Province
Report that Agricultural Production in the Old Base Area Has Reached Pre-War Levels

In their letter, the representatives of agricultural labor models in Shanxi Province first wished Chairman Mao good health. The letter said: We were all poor people in the past. Under your leadership, we have land and have turned over. Listening to your words, organizing ourselves, increasing production, and improving our lives. Now the production in the villages in the old liberated areas of Shanxi has reached the pre-war level, and the villages in the new liberated areas are also about to reach the pre-war level. This time we came to Beijing to attend the meeting, meet you, and listen to your words. We feel really honored. Today's glory and happiness are all due to your leadership. We will always be grateful for your leadership and follow you!

This time we must firmly remember your words, humbly learn from the national heroes and labor models, bring back experience, and lead the masses to produce well, actively support the front, liberate Taiwan and Tibet, and oppose American imperialist aggression.

This time we came to the meeting, all entrusted by the masses. We must bring the meeting and your instructions to the masses, and we must have good contact with the masses, never be arrogant, and never be complacent!

Representatives of agricultural labor models in Shanxi Province: Li Shunda, Guo Baochai, Liu Jubao, Chang Tingan, Wang Qi, Jia Baozhi, Zhang Zhiquan, Liu Changyi, Chen Fengxian, Guo Nengcheng.

　　英雄模范代表们上书毛主席
    【本报讯】出席全国战斗英雄代表会议及工农兵劳模代表会议的英模代表们，纷纷写信给毛主席致敬，报告过去生产情形及保证今后在各自的岗位上努力更好地完成任务。下面是一部分原信或原信的摘要。
    东北军区骑兵战斗英雄马春雨
    保证接受与完成一切艰巨任务
    骑兵战斗英雄马春雨给毛主席的信中说：
    我代表我们全师的指战员向您问好。
    你讲的话是我们今后一切工作中的指南针，我保证传达给每个战士，让他们牢牢记住。我们虽在生产中，但每个人也都认识美帝侵略的罪行，如果它胆敢阻止我们解放台湾、西藏，我们要求您将一切艰巨而伟大的任务交给我们骑兵。我们一定能有把握把侵略者打垮。我们坚决声援朝鲜人民，保卫世界永久和平！
    我向您宣誓：我愿为祖国流尽最后一滴血来完成光荣伟大的任务，永远做你的一个好战士！
    东北劳模、女拖拉机队长梁军
    报告萌芽学校发展及壮大情形
    新中国第一个女拖拉机手梁军的信中说：
    毛主席：我在黑龙江省德都县萌芽学校学习，是农业机械科女拖拉机队队长，我的名字叫梁军。
    这个学校是一群穷孩子过去没有念过书或念书很少的青年创办的。在成立时只有五十多名同学，桌子五六个；几把镐头和几把铁铣，三把笤帚，房子和地都没有；吃的饭是发霉了的包米?子（棒子破碎了），冻萝卜条子熬汤。那时我们自己做饭，自己打柴、种地、拉犁杖等。到冬季十月天很冷，我们为了买车马，同学们组织起来上山打柴，手脚都冻坏了，十天打三万捆柴，换了三匹马、一辆车，准备来年生产用。
    一九四八年，我和另外两个男同学，去学开拖拉机。我们克服了很多困难，在两个月学会了简单的驾驶和一般的技术了。卒业后，政府给我们四台拖拉机，就回到萌芽学校了。学校为了扩大生产，同学们更能得到学习，又派了十五名同学和我们三人建立起一个拖拉机队，从此就开始了开荒工作了。在我们努力摸索中，战胜了技术上不成熟的困难。由于克服了技术上不够成熟和使用油料上的困难，我们就开了五百垧荒地，种了一百垧地。秋天，我们五十多个同学，一方面秋收，一方面盖房子，准备过冬（原来学校是在德都县城里住，后来因为扩大生产，就搬到距德都县十五里远一个荒岗子上，开始时架起几个小窝棚暂时居住）。冬季来了，我们住在自己盖起来的房子里，吃着自己种出来的粮食，政治文化技术学习，都开始了。
    一九四九年，政府又给我们五台机器。我们把去年开起来的地都种上了，又开了一千垧荒。拖拉机手们也增加了。今年，我们把一千五百垧地都种上了。六月三号，又成立了女拖拉机队。她们在工作上学习上都很积极。我来参加全国工农兵劳模代表会议时，他（她）们告诉我代表他（她）们给毛主席问好，全体同学和老师们向毛主席问好。并告诉毛主席：我们在共产党和毛主席所领导的学校里，热诚地学习政治、文化、科学知识，拖拉机手们热心地开拖拉机和学着近代化的拖拉机和农业技术，开发着东北的北大荒。
    毛主席：我们现在的生活比以前好多了，家底也大了。现在我们用亲手开出来的土地有一千五百垧，房子一百间，制粉厂一个，油房一个，铁工厂一个，小型被服厂一个，马八十匹，大车十二台，汽车三台，拖拉机十台，各种农具十八件，五头大奶牛。同学们到冬季常喝牛奶。每天都能吃到面，猪肉也常吃，生活得到改善。学生原先有五十多个，现在有三百二十个，老师有十二、三个，其余工作人员也不少。今年又烧砖，准备来年盖砖房子。毛主席：您说我们的生活多好！
    敬爱的毛主席：我们这群穷孩子能过着这样幸福的生活，都是共产党和你毛主席给我们的，今后一定好好干，把学校建设得更好，我们的生活就会更好起来。
    东北邮电劳模卢兴文等
    坚决贯彻责任制消灭差错
    东北邮电工业劳模代表卢兴文、刘长贵、王维本的信中说：只有工人阶级领导的政权下，才能有这样的全国工农兵劳模代表会议召开，所以我们特别感激党和您给我们的领导与鼓舞。为了庆祝这次伟大的会议和第一个国庆日的来临，我们一定要以实际行动在我们的工作——邮电事业中贯彻责任制，减少障碍，消灭差错，保证完成上级所给我们的光荣任务，并且坚决拥护世界持久和平，誓死反对美帝国主义侵略战争，支援咱们的人民解放大军早日解放台湾和西藏，为建设自由、幸福、富强的新中国而奋斗！
    青岛纺织女工劳模陈淑德说明
    自己有成绩是因有毛主席领导
    青岛工业劳模代表、纺织女工劳模陈淑德在信中首先代表青岛市纺织女工致敬。信中说：
    今年二月间匪机轰炸上海，上级号召我们突击生产二十支纱来稳定物价，我们接受了星期日加夜班，两班工作二十二小时的突击工作制，但以后匪机又到青岛来捣乱，我们暂时改变了日班时间，但到四月底我们仍完成了生产任务。在这期间，我家离厂十多里，从未迟到、早退或停工。我并且还团结说服了一些年青的小姊妹们。
    四月间上级号召我们纠正生产偏向，组织竞赛迎接红五月，要求降低成本，完成财政任务。我及时帮助了小姊妹们学习生头方法的改进、尽力消灭空锭，加强清洁工作，减少纺花，团结着车工，使三厂竞赛后，成本降低百分之四、五。
    我为什么能这样做呢？这与您的领导是分不开的。您解放了我们，把我们由奴隶提高成主人，您正确决定的接管三不动的原则，保障了我们的生活；您指明了城乡互助，内外交流的道路，支持了我们的工厂开工，您也教育了干部走群众路线，解决了我们工作中的一切困难；您运用了集体英雄主义，提高了我们的生产积极性。总之，一切是与您的领导分不开的。我以后更得要好好地学习政治，学习技术，以便在您的领导下，更好地为新中国的建设事业努力！
    山西省农业劳模代表全体
    报告老区农产达战前水平
    山西省农业劳模代表，在信中首先向毛主席问候身体健康。信中说：我们过去都是穷苦人，在您领导下才有了土地、翻了身，听上您的话，组织起来，提高生产，改善了生活，现在山西老解放区的村庄，生产已到了战前水平，新解放区村庄也快要到战前水平了。这次我们来北京开会，见见您的面，听听您的说话，感觉实在光荣。今天的光荣、幸福，都是您领导的功劳，我们永远感激您的领导，跟着您走！
    这次开会我们一定要牢记下您的话，虚心向全国各英雄劳模们学习，带回经验，好好带领群众生产，积极支援前线，解放台湾、西藏，反对美帝国主义侵略。
    我们这次来开会，都是受了群众的委托。回去一定要把大会和您的指示都带给群众，要好好联系群众，决不骄傲，决不自满！
    山西省农业劳模代表李顺达、郭宝才、刘聚宝、常亭安、王杞、贾宝执、张志全、刘长义、陈凤仙、郭能成。
