Glorious Son of the Li People
    ——Qiongya Combat Hero Chen Liwen
    You Qi
    Outstanding Hero Among the Ethnic Minorities
    In the presidium of the National Conference of Combat Heroes, there were several hero representatives from ethnic minorities, one of whom was Chen Liwen, a Li combat hero from the Qiongya Column.
    Chen Liwen is from Shixiao Village, Baonan Township, Baoting County, Qiongya Ethnic Minority Autonomous Region. He joined the Qiongya Column in May 1941. Before he joined the army, the Japanese invaders had already occupied Hainan Island, and a large number of Kuomintang bandits fled into the Wuzhi Mountains, forcibly occupying all the places where the Li people lived. These bandits treated the ethnic minorities with extreme barbarity, in addition to extorting exorbitant taxes and levies, they also endlessly drove them to perform corvée labor. As a result, within only one or two years after the bandits entered the Wuzhi Mountains, his mother died, his younger brother was shot and killed, and his uncle was forced to hang himself, leaving his family broken and destroyed. This situation prompted Chen Liwen to resolutely head to the Qiongya Column from afar.
    The Kuomintang reactionaries planted deep hatred in Chen Liwen's heart, which inspired this young fighter's fearlessness and bravery. For nine years, he actively participated in almost every important battle in Qiongya.
    In every battle, Chen Liwen would always say to his superiors:
    "Fighting requires a large army, but the assault mission must always be left to me!"
    Chen Liwen is such a strong and fearless warrior, the glorious son of the Li people, and an excellent member of the Communist Party of China.
    An Unreported Report Outline
    The presidium of the National Conference of Combat Heroes studied the heroic deeds of this ethnic minority combat hero and decided to have him give a typical report at the conference. He initially agreed and wrote a report outline; however, later, considering the insurmountable language difficulties (no translator), he requested the presidium to cancel his report item. After deliberation, the presidium agreed to his request. The following is the outline of his speech that he prepared but did not deliver:
    Respected leaders, fellow representatives:
    My name is Chen Liwen. I am a Li person from Hainan Island. I joined the Qiongya Column at the age of fourteen and am now twenty-three years old. I have served as a soldier, light machine gunner, squad leader, and now I am a platoon leader.
    The Qiongya Column was established as early as 1928. For more than twenty years, it has carried out many arduous struggles against the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang reactionaries. When I first joined the army, a battalion had only one light machine gun, and a company had only twenty or thirty broken rifles, with more than ten bullets for each gun. At that time, there was no rear, and we were often hungry and cold, living in the mountains and forests all year round, and only came out at night to attack the enemy.
    Since I joined, I have participated in more than a hundred battles, eight of which were relatively large siege battles. Now I want to report on one of those eight.
    In July last year, our Qiongya Column wanted to attack the Tunchang stronghold in Ding'an County. This was a very large town, with more than two hundred enemies inside, with five light machine guns, two heavy machine guns, a grenade launcher, and one hundred fifty to sixty rifles. There were also many fortifications around Tunchang, including eighteen small bunkers, six large bunkers, two layers of barbed wire outside the bunkers, a ditch, and communication trenches everywhere.
    At that time, I was the deputy platoon leader. Seeing the situation, I volunteered to the company commander to join the assault team.
    I first went to the position to reconnoiter, and climbed to the barbed wire. Because we didn't have explosives at that time, and the terrain was bare, we couldn't destroy it with our hands, so I came back. When I came back and saw the regimental commander, the regimental commander asked me if I had a solution? I thought for a moment and said, "Yes!"
    I asked the regimental commander to concentrate firepower and provide machine gun cover, and I led an assault squad to lay cotton quilts on the barbed wire, and we climbed over it; however, because our southern cotton quilts were very thin and could not cover the barbs, our clothes were torn and our flesh was broken.
    I climbed over the barbed wire first, and immediately rolled into the ditch, approaching the enemy's bunker. At this time, the enemies on both sides were shooting at us. Before long, the entire squad I brought up was killed or wounded. Fortunately, while the enemy was fighting with us, two more squads took advantage of the gap to come up from behind. I ordered them to block the enemy's bunker, and I led several grenade throwers straight into the enemy's barracks on Tunchang Street. The troops behind saw that I had entered the street, and they poured in in large numbers. When the enemies saw that they had been divided and their connection with each other had been cut off, they panicked and were all wiped out by us.
    This time I was able to come to Beijing to attend this conference, which is something that our Li people could not have dreamed of for hundreds of lifetimes. This time I met Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. When I go back, I must better improve my tactics and defend the southernmost border and coastal defense of the motherland.
    Tiger on the Battlefield
    The battles on Hainan Island are, of course, smaller than those on the mainland, but they have their hardships and their special difficulties. The Qiongya Column was able to overcome various difficulties in an isolated and helpless environment, defeat superior enemies, and constantly grow stronger. Its achievements are as great as the struggles on the mainland.
    Combat hero Chen Liwen is one of the typical representatives of the entire Qiongya army in the arduous struggle on Hainan Island. His deeds are very extraordinary. In addition to the battle he mentioned in the outline, there is another battle that must be mentioned.
    That was in the spring of 1949, during the first spring offensive launched by the Qiongya Column. The troops that Chen Liwen was in were to capture the town of Haobao in Chengmai County.
    Haobao was a medium-sized stronghold of the Chiang bandits. At the entrance to the street, the enemy had built two bunkers, surrounded by several rows of barricades and moats. At that time, the equipment of the Qiongya Column was still very poor. There were no heavy weapons, no explosives, and no experience in sieges. It became a very difficult task to capture such a stronghold.
    When Chen Liwen saw the enemy, he was inspired with infinite power. He was the first to request to join the assault team to capture the most fortified bunker. The soldiers who were used to guerrilla warfare were a little timid when they saw the bunkers. Because they saw Chen Liwen's heroic behavior, they were greatly encouraged. More than forty people immediately responded to sign up to join the assault team.
    Chen Liwen led five comrades to climb to the enemy's forward positions. First, they helped the demolition team pry open the barricades, and then he was the first to rush into the gap under the cover of machine guns, straddling two or three moats, and pounced on the bunker as quickly as a tiger. He found a good terrain, and the six of them fought the enemies in the bunker with hand grenades.
    The six of them fought in front of the bunker for half an hour, and used up all seventy hand grenades they had brought. When the smoke cleared, Chen Liwen saw that the tall bunker still stood stubbornly, and two of his comrades had been injured. His anger could no longer be suppressed. He showed the tenacious and indomitable character of the Li people, advancing in the face of difficulties. He ran back to the rear position from the enemy's gunfire, asked the platoon leader for six hand grenades, tied them together, and then ran to the front of the bunker like a flying tiger. He asked two comrades to hold him up, and he himself climbed to the top of the bunker and stuffed a bundle of hand grenades completely into the bunker. With a "boom," all the enemies were wiped out in the bunker.
    Haobao was captured. This was the first siege battle of the Qiongya Column. Chen Liwen used his courage and boldness to gain experience for the first siege battle of the Qiongya Column.

　　黎族人民的光荣子弟
    ——琼崖战斗英雄陈理文
    尤淇
    少数民族中杰出的英雄
    在全国战斗英雄代表会议的主席团里，有好几个少数民族的英雄代表，琼崖纵队的黎族战斗英雄陈理文就是其中的一个。
    陈理文是琼崖少数民族自治区保亭县保南乡什小村人，他在一九四一年五月间参加琼崖纵队。在他参军以前，日寇已侵占我海南岛，大批国民党匪徒便逃进了五指山里，强占了所有黎族人民居住的地方。这批匪徒们对待少数民族蛮横到了极点，除强征暴敛之外，还要无休止地驱供劳役。这样，在匪徒们进入五指山后的不过一、二年之内，他母亲死了，弟弟又被枪杀，叔叔被迫上吊，弄得家破人亡。这种情况促使陈理文毅然远远地投奔到了琼崖纵队。
    国民党反动派在陈理文的心里种下了深深的仇恨，这仇恨激发了这位青年战士的无畏和勇敢。九年以来，差不多琼崖的每一个重要的战斗都有他积极的参加。
    每一次战斗，陈理文总要对上级首长说：
    “打仗要用千军万马，但突击任务总得留给我一份”！
    陈理文就是这样一个坚强无畏的战士，黎族人民的光荣子弟，中国共产党的优秀党员。
    一篇未曾报告的报告提纲
    全国战斗英雄代表会议的主席团研究了这位少数民族战斗英雄的英勇事迹，决定叫他在会议上作一次典型的报告。开始他答应了，而且写了报告的提纲；但是到后来，他考虑到语言上的不可克服的困难（没有翻译），他要求主席团撤销他的报告项目，主席团在研究后也就同意了他的要求。下面就是他准备报告而没有报告的发言提纲：
    各位首长，各位代表同志：
    我叫陈理文，是海南岛的黎人，十四岁参加琼崖纵队，今年二十三岁。在部队里当过战士、轻机枪射手、班长、现在是排长。
    琼崖纵队是一九二八年就成立的，二十几年来同日本仔、国民党反动派进行了很多艰苦的斗争。当我初参加部队时，一个营只有一挺轻机枪，一个连只有二、三十支破步枪，每枝枪十多粒子弹。那时也没后方，经常挨饿受冻，成年住在山林里，只有到了晚上才能出来打击敌人。
    我参加以后，经过了一百多次战斗，其中有八次是比较大的攻坚战，现在我要报告的，就是八次之中的一次。
    去年七月间，我们琼崖纵队要攻定安县的屯昌据点。这是一个很大的市镇，里面敌人有二百多人，有五挺轻机枪，二挺重机枪，一个掷弹筒，一百五六十支步枪。屯昌周围还有很多工事，计有：小碉堡十八个，大碉堡六个，碉堡外有两层铁丝网，一道外壕，到处还有交通沟。
    当时我是副排长，看到那情形，我就向连长报名参加突击队。
    我就首先到阵地上去侦察，爬到铁丝网旁边，因为我们那时还没有炸药，地形又光光的，靠两只手不能破坏它，便回来了。回来见到团长，团长问我有没有办法？我想了一想说：“有！”
    我请团长集中火力，加上机枪掩护，便由我带了一个突击班，用棉被铺到铁丝网上，我们就从那上面爬了过去；不过因为我们南方的棉被很薄，罩不住铁刺，我们的衣服都刮烂了，肉也刮破了。
    我先爬过铁丝网，马上便滚进外壕里，接近了敌人的地堡。这时两边的敌人都向我们打枪，不到多久，我带上去的一个班便全部伤亡了。幸好在敌人跟我们打仗的时候，后面又乘空上来了两个班，我便指挥他们封锁敌人的地堡，我自己就带了几个投弹手，一直攻进到屯昌街的敌人营房里。后面的部队看见我已进了街，也就大批大批地涌进来了。敌人一看到自己已被分割，相互之间的联系也断了，他们恐慌起来，就被我们统统消灭了。
    我这次能够到北京来，参加这个大会，在我们黎人说来是几百辈子梦想不到的事。我这次见了毛主席和朱总司令，回去一定要更好地提高战术，保卫祖国最南部的国境和海防。
    战场上的猛虎
    海南岛上的战斗，比起大陆上来当然是小的，但他们有他们的艰苦，有他们特殊的困难。琼崖纵队能够在孤立无援的环境中克服各种困难，战胜优势的敌人，使自己不断壮大起来，其功绩跟大陆上的斗争一样的伟大。
    战斗英雄陈理文，就是在海南岛的艰苦奋战中全琼崖部队的典型代表之一，他的事迹很不平常，除他自己在提纲中所说的那个战斗之外，还有一个战斗必须提一下。
    那是一九四九年的春天，在琼崖纵队发动的第一个春季攻势中，陈理文在的那个部队要攻取澄迈县的好保镇。
    好保是蒋匪的一个中等据点，在进街的路口敌人筑了两座碉堡，周围还有好几道鹿砦和濠沟。当时琼崖纵队的装备还很差，没有重火器，没有炸药，也没有攻坚的经验，要想攻下这样一个据点，就成了非常困难的任务。
    陈理文见到了敌人，就激发起无穷力量，他第一个要求参加突击队，去攻取其中最坚固的一座碉堡。打惯了游击战的战士们见到了碉堡本来是有点畏怯的，因为看到了陈理文的英雄行为，受到了很大鼓励，响应报名参加突击队的人，马上就有了四十多个。
    陈理文带了五个同志爬到了敌人的工事前沿，先帮破坏组撬开了鹿砦，然后他就第一个在机枪掩护下冲进了缺口，跨过二、三道外壕，象猛虎一样快捷地扑到了碉堡跟前，找了一块好地形，六个人就和碉堡里的敌人用手榴弹战斗了起来。
    他们六个人在碉堡跟前打了半个钟头，把所有带上去的七十个手榴弹都摔光了。当烟雾消散，陈理文看到高高的碉堡依然顽固地矗立着，而自己的同志却有两个已经受伤的时候，他的愤怒再也压抑不住了，他表现了黎族人民的顽强不屈的越是困难越往前进的性格。他从敌人的枪火中跑回后面的阵地，向排长要了六颗手榴弹，把它捆到一起，然后又飞虎一样地跑到碉堡跟前。他叫两个同志托着，他自己就爬着到了碉堡头上，把一捆手榴弹完全塞进了碉堡里。“轰隆”一下，敌人全部被消灭在碉堡里了。
    好保就被攻取了。这是琼崖纵队攻坚战斗的第一次。陈理文以自己的勇猛大胆获取了琼崖纵队第一次攻坚战的经验。
    一九五○年十月一日
