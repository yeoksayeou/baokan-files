　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 25th: According to TASS, Moscow newspapers on the 24th all published editorials commenting on the Soviet Union's third-quarter production achievements. The editorials unanimously pointed out that the remarkable development of the Soviet national economy fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.

　　The Zhenli Bao [Truth Daily] editorial wrote: The vigorous rise of the Soviet national economy is the result of the Soviet people's peaceful labor, in stark contrast to the current economic situation in the capitalist world. Over the past twenty years, Soviet industrial production has increased ninefold, while the industrial output of the whole of capitalist Europe has remained at its original level. The industrial output of the United States in July 1949 was only 65 percent of the highest level during World War II, 18 percent lower than in October 1948.

　　The editorial emphasized: The economy of the capitalist world is trapped in insoluble contradictions. American imperialism is trying to find a way out by igniting the flames of war all over the world. Now, the American economy is engaged in wartime production, and huge military expenditures are heavily burdening the working people.

　　The Laodong Bao [Labor Daily] editorial stated: The socialist system not only guarantees the steady development of expanded reproduction, but also guarantees all the material and cultural needs of the working people. Compared with the third quarter of last year, Soviet food sales have increased by 30 percent, and manufactured goods sales have increased by 37 percent. The Soviet people are already eating better and dressing better.

　　苏联经济的发展是社会主义制度的优越性
    苏联各报评第三季生产成就
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：二十四日的莫斯科各报均发表社论，评述苏联第三季生产成就。社论一致指出：苏联国民经济的显著发展充分说明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。
    真理报社论写道：苏联国民经济的蓬勃上升是苏联人民和平劳动的成果，与资本主义世界当前的经济情况适成相反的对照。二十年来苏联的工业生产已增加为九倍，而整个资本主义欧洲的工业产量却一直停留在原有的水平上。美国一九四九年七月的工业产量仅为第二次世界大战期间最高水平的百分之六十五，比一九四八年十月还低百分之十八。
    社论强调称：资本主义世界的经济已陷于无法解决的矛盾中。美帝国主义正力图在全世界燃起战火来找寻出路。现在，美国的经济正进行着战时生产，庞大的军费负担正沉重地压在劳动人民的肩上。
    劳动报社论称：社会主义制度不仅保证了扩大再生产的稳步发展，而且保证了劳动人民物质和文化生活的一切需要。与去年第三季相较，苏联食物销售量已提高了百分之三十，制成品销售量增加了百分之三十七，苏联人民已经吃得更好、穿得更好了。
