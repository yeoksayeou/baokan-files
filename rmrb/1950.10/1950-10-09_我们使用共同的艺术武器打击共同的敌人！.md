　　"We Use Common Artistic Weapons to Strike Common Enemies!"
    Yan Han
    The working group of five people, including Wang Yeqiu, from the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, participating in the Soviet "Chinese Art Exhibition", arrived at Otbor, the Soviet border, on August 29th, carrying 110 large boxes of ancient and modern artworks. The Vice Chairman of the Chita Oblast, Matveyeva, "Stalin Prize" winner, Vice Chairman of the Artists Association, and painter of portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu in China, Finogenov, and the Chairman of the Chita Oblast Artists Association, young painter Gorubov, had been waiting in Otbor for two days. They said: "The Soviet people are eagerly awaiting the opening of the Chinese Art Exhibition in Moscow on October 1st. On this historically significant first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, this art exhibition is a symbol of the New China."
    They showed great interest in the modern "Fine Arts Creation Collection" and photos of ancient art exhibits, especially emphasizing the Chinese people's struggles reflected in modern art works and the realistic elements in ancient art.
    We were meeting for the first time, but we were already familiar with each other. Despite the language barrier, we were fully able to experience the eternal and solid friendship between our two countries. Finogenov told us with a kind and forceful gesture: "We are all using common artistic weapons to strike common enemies."
    Finogenov was very concerned about and encouraged the work of Chinese artists, saying that the Chinese people have completed a great task, and the Chinese people's revolutionary war has world-historical significance and extremely rich content. Artists should describe it well and leave it to future generations. At the same time, he believes that this work will also help the oppressed nations of the East.
    On the train in Siberia, I was fortunate enough to see Finogenov completing a very important work for the Chinese people, which has extremely high artistic achievements. After returning to the Soviet Union from participating in the Soviet cultural delegation to China last year, he created a collection of sixty paintings (the title has not yet been determined). This work adopts the style of Chinese serial cartoons, with the original paintings being equivalent to the size of octavo paper sketches. He used his skillful techniques to profoundly depict the various stages of the Chinese revolution led by the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, up to today's victory. From his works, we can see Finogenov's Marxist-Leninist cultivation and internationalist spirit. He not only loves the people of the Soviet Union, but also loves the working people of all countries.
    Finogenov also wrote a book, "In New China", which, along with his album, will be published on October 1st as a gift to commemorate the founding of the People's Republic of China. At that time, we thanked him and hoped that he would create some large-scale oil paintings about the Chinese people's liberation movement in the future and exhibit them in the Chinese Revolution Museum. He immediately said: "If I can, I would be very happy." On the train, he entertained us while rushing to write explanations, constantly working. A great work can be produced anywhere. Finogenov's work ethic and his personality are very admirable, and his work itself gives us great encouragement and confidence.
    Finogenov said that when the Soviet Union first ended its civil war and began economic construction, Soviet artists only began to fight for realism and ideological improvement (at that time, most Soviet painters still stood on formalist positions). Although China's construction is more than 30 years behind the Soviet Union, Chinese art is different. Before the founding of the Republic, many painters had already stood on the side of the people and had a fairly high level of artistic skill. With the experience of the Soviet Union over the past 30 years and a clear direction, it will be much faster for the works of Chinese artists to achieve a high degree of ideology and artistry.
    He gave a very high evaluation of modern Chinese art, especially the achievements of woodcuts, believing that they are full of the meaning of life in terms of ideological and technical expression. They are not fabricated, but are embodied from actual life. Progressive artists have achieved great victories in overcoming formalism and the influence of Western European bourgeois art. I finally told him that in this regard, we must especially thank Chairman Mao and the Chinese people.

　　“我们使用共同的艺术武器打击共同的敌人！”
    彦涵
    中央人民政府文化部参加苏联“中国艺展”的以王冶秋等五人组成的工作组，携带古代和现代的艺术品一百一十大箱，于八月二十九日到达苏联边境奥特堡。赤塔州副主席马特维耶娃，“斯大林奖金”获得者、美术家协会副主席、在中国为毛主席朱总司令画像的费诺格诺夫和赤塔州美协主席青年画家郭鲁波夫，已在奥特堡等待两天，他们说：“苏联的人民正在渴望着中国艺展于十月一日在莫斯科开幕。值此有历史意义的中华人民共和国成立一周年纪念的一天，这个艺展就是新中国的标志。”
    他们看到现代“美术创作集”和古代艺术展品照片，都发生极大的兴趣，特别重视现代美术作品中所反映的中国人民的斗争生活、和古代艺术中的现实主义的因素。
    我们都是初次会面，但是彼此早已熟悉了，虽有语言的限制，也完全能够体验到我们两国之间的永恒牢固的友谊。费诺格诺夫用亲切而有力的手势告诉我们：“我们都是使用共同的艺术武器，打击着共同的敌人”。
    费诺格诺夫十分关心和鼓励中国美术家的工作，说中国人民已经完成了一个很大的任务，中国人民革命战争具有世界历史意义和极其丰富的内容，美术家应该很好的描写下来，留给后代，同时，他认为这一工作也将有助于东方被压迫的民族。
    在西伯利亚的火车上，很幸运的看到了费诺格诺夫正在为中国人民完成一件很重大的工作，它在艺术上有极高的成就。就是他去年参加苏联文化代表团到中国来，回到苏联以后，创作了六十幅的一本画集（题目尚未确定）。这部作品是采取中国连环画的方式，原画相等于八开纸大小的素描。他运用他的熟练技巧，深刻地描绘了中国共产党、毛主席、朱总司令所领导的中国革命各个阶段，直到胜利的今天。从他的作品上看出了费诺格诺夫的马列主义的修养和国际主义的精神，他不仅热爱苏联的人民，也同样热爱一切国度的劳动人民。
    费诺格诺夫还写了一本“在新中国”，和他的画册一起，将在十月一日出版，作为向中华人民共和国成立纪念的献礼。当时我们就感谢他并希望他在将来用油画创作一些有关中国人民解放运动的巨幅，展出在中国革命博物馆里，他即表示：“我如果能够的话，那就太高兴了”。在火车上一面招待我们，一面还赶写说明，随时都在进行工作。一个伟大的作品，在任何地方都可产生出来的。费诺格诺夫这种工作精神和他的为人，使我们十分感佩，他这个工作的本身就是给我们很大的激励和信心。
    费诺格诺夫谈到苏联在过去内战刚结束，开始经济建设的时候，苏联美术家才开始为现实主义与提高思想性而斗争（当时苏联画家多数还站在形式主义立场上），中国建设虽然较苏联落后了三十几年，可是中国的美术是不同的，在共和国成立之前，已有很多画家站在人民的立场上，并且有了相当高的艺术水平，还有苏联这三十年来的经验，有了明确的方向，因此，中国美术家的作品要达成高度思想性与艺术性，比较要快得多了。
    他对于中国现代美术，作了很高的估价，特别是木刻的成就，认为表现在思想上技巧上，他们都充满着生活的意味，不是虚构，而是从实际的生活中间体现出来的，在克服形式主义和西欧资产阶级艺术的影响，进步的美术家已经获得了很大的胜利。我最后告诉他，在这方面，我们要特别感谢毛主席和中国人民。
