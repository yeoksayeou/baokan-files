　　What is the United Nations all about?

　　The United Nations was created at the end of World War II. According to the provisions of the "United Nations Charter," its basic task is to "maintain international peace and security."

　　In view of the painful lessons of the fascist powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan launching World War II, the people of all countries in the world were universally concerned about how to maintain international peace and security after the war, even when the world anti-fascist war was still raging. The issue of lasting peace after the war was discussed at the Tehran Conference of the Soviet, British, and American powers at the end of November 1943. From August 21 to September 29, 1944, representatives of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom held a meeting at Dumbarton Oaks in the United States to draft a plan for the organization of the "United Nations" structure. The Crimea Conference of the three powers in February 1945 also decided to "establish a general international organization for maintaining peace and security as soon as possible." According to the decision of the Crimea Conference, the United Nations Conference was held in San Francisco from April 25 to June 1945 and the "United Nations Charter" was formulated. This Charter clearly stipulates that the purpose of the United Nations organization is "to maintain international peace and security; and to this end, to take effective collective measures to prevent and eliminate threats to peace, to suppress acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace; and to adjust or resolve international disputes or situations that may lead to breaches of the peace by peaceful means and in accordance with the principles of justice and international law." Representatives from fifty-one countries participated in this conference, and Dong Biwu, a representative from the Chinese Liberated Areas, also attended the conference. The first session of the United Nations General Assembly was held in London in January 1946, and the main organs of the United Nations were formed.

　　As of now, sixty countries have joined the United Nations. Except for the Soviet Union, Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, the others are all capitalist countries. However, China's seat is still illegally occupied by the Kuomintang bandit gang.

　　The United Nations is organized according to the principles of equality among all countries and unanimity among the great powers. The United Nations institutions include the United Nations General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship Council, the International Court of Justice, and the Secretariat. There are also some specialized agencies and affiliated bodies.

　　The United Nations General Assembly is the general assembly of all member states and is the general deliberative body of the United Nations, holding regular sessions once a year. The powers of the General Assembly are to consider the overall policy of cooperation on the maintenance of international peace and security, to make recommendations to member states and the Security Council, to approve the admission of new member states, and to elect non-permanent members of the Security Council and members of the Economic and Social Council. In the General Assembly, each member state has one vote. Resolutions of the General Assembly are adopted with the support of a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting.

　　The Security Council is the most important permanent body in the United Nations. According to the United Nations Charter, the member states of the United Nations entrust the Security Council with the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. Therefore, the Security Council has broad powers. It can investigate any dispute or situation that may cause international friction or give rise to a dispute, can determine the existence of any threat to peace, breach of peace, or act of aggression, and can take economic and even military action to prevent or suppress acts of aggression. It is composed of five permanent members: China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, and six non-permanent members. The non-permanent members are elected by the United Nations General Assembly for a term of two years, with half of them being re-elected each year. Resolutions on procedural matters are decided by an affirmative vote of seven members of the Council. Resolutions on all other matters other than procedural matters must be decided by an affirmative vote of seven members of the Council, including all permanent members. If any permanent member expresses opposition, the motion cannot be passed. This is the "veto power" generally referred to. The existence of this veto power is to implement the principle of unanimity among the great powers stipulated in the Charter.

　　The Economic and Social Council is composed of eighteen member states elected by the United Nations General Assembly. Council members serve a term of three years, with six countries being re-elected each year. It holds regular sessions three times a year, and all motions can be passed by a majority vote. Its task is to conduct research on international economic, social, cultural, educational, health, and the promotion of human rights and safeguards, and to submit proposals to the United Nations General Assembly and member states.

　　The task of the Trusteeship Council is to handle matters relating to trust territories, such as reviewing reports from the administering authorities and inspecting the trust territories on a regular basis. It is composed of the five major powers and member states administering trust territories.

　　The International Court of Justice is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations.

　　The Secretariat is composed of the Secretary-General and a number of staff members. The Secretary-General is appointed by the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council and is the chief administrative officer of the United Nations organization.

　　The United Nations organization has been in existence for five years now. During this long period, the United Nations organization has been in a very complex situation, and there has been a fierce struggle between two lines within it. The imperialist bloc headed by the United States has tried to turn the United Nations into a tool for it to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and carry out aggression. The Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, based on the interests of the people all over the world, have resolutely opposed this sinister conspiracy of the imperialist bloc and struggled to defend the United Nations Charter and enable the United Nations to truly shoulder the responsibility of maintaining international peace and security. The struggle between these two lines has been very obvious in the successive sessions of the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council. This struggle has always mainly focused on issues such as disarmament, the prohibition of atomic bombs, and the principle of unanimity among the great powers. The Soviet Union has proposed peaceful proposals such as disarmament, the prohibition of atomic bombs, and the conclusion of peace treaties to eliminate the danger of war at previous sessions of the General Assembly. These proposals are in line with the will of the people all over the world, but they have all been overturned by the majority manipulated by US imperialism. US imperialism has also openly organized the aggressive North Atlantic Military Alliance, disregarding the United Nations and violating the United Nations Charter. The United States also manipulated the majority in the General Assembly to pass illegal organizations such as the "Temporary Commission on Korea" and the "Balkan Committee" to implement its despicable conspiracy to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. The attitudes of the United States and the Soviet Union are also completely opposite on the issue of the principle of unanimity among the great powers. The Soviet Union has always firmly supported the principle of unanimity among the great powers, because only in this way can the United Nations organization truly play a role in maintaining world peace and security; but US imperialism, in order to make it easier for itself to manipulate the United Nations, has tried every means to undermine the principle of unanimity among the great powers. The United States has instigated its vassal states to propose at previous sessions of the General Assembly to abolish or amend the use of the "veto power" in the Security Council. In order to seize the power of the Security Council, the United States also manipulated the majority in the United Nations General Assembly in November 1947 to pass an illegal "Little General Assembly"; the main feature of this "Little General Assembly" is to exercise power by majority vote, which is convenient for the United States to control. The purpose of the United States is to use it as a permanent body to replace the Security Council composed according to the principle of unanimity among the great powers. The establishment of this organization clearly illustrates the sinister intentions of US imperialism to undermine the United Nations Charter.

　　After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the issue of the representation of the People's Republic of China has become one of the centers of struggle within the United Nations. The Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries warmly support the reasonable demands of the Chinese people and insist that representatives of the People's Republic of China should attend the United Nations organization, while the British and American blocs unreasonably refuse the representatives of the People's Republic of China to enter the United Nations and allow the Kuomintang remnants to illegally occupy China's seat. This puts the United Nations organization in an illegal state and unable to fulfill its responsibility to maintain peace.

　　On June 27 this year, US imperialism, without the presence of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, the two permanent members of the Security Council, manipulated the Security Council to hold an illegal meeting and passed an illegal decision to invade Korea. This fact shows that the United States is blatantly dragging the United Nations onto the road to war. The banner of peace of the United Nations has been stained by the bloody hands of the American aggressors.

　　The fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly is now being held, and the Security Council is also in session. In these two meetings, a fierce struggle is taking place around the issues of the Korean War, the US aggression against Taiwan, the representation of the People's Republic of China, and the principle of unanimity among the great powers. The imperialist bloc headed by the United States is trying to expand its aggression through the United Nations (the proposal submitted by the United Kingdom and eight other countries on October 7th, which was passed by the United Nations General Assembly, to have the US military occupy the entire Korea, illustrates this point), and further undermine the principle of unanimity among the great powers (the US proposal to have the United Nations General Assembly exercise the functions of the Security Council when necessary is for this purpose). Representatives of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are waging a resolute struggle to stop this sinister conspiracy of the United States. The Declaration on Lasting Peace and many other proposals to stop aggression recently submitted by the Soviet Union to the General Assembly are concrete manifestations of the Soviet Union's insistence on peace and opposition to war.

　　The United Nations was originally an organization for maintaining international peace and security. Due to the manipulation and sabotage of US imperialism, it has now become very weak. With the United States manipulating the majority of votes, it is very difficult, even impossible, for the United Nations to pass resolutions that conform to the interests of the people of the world. But even so, the United Nations is still an important international forum, and with the persistent struggle of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, it still has a certain role to play in stopping aggression. Today, most countries in the world are still under the rule of reactionaries (it is precisely this situation that enables US imperialism to control the majority of countries in the United Nations and manipulate the majority of votes in the United Nations). The reactionaries in these countries deceive the people every day and every hour by various despicable methods, preventing them from understanding the truth of international affairs. In this situation, the representatives of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries can use the United Nations as a forum to expose the war conspiracies of the British and American imperialist blocs to the people all over the world. This is of great significance for arousing the awareness of the people all over the world and enhancing their enthusiasm for the struggle against US imperialism. Although the British and American blocs, which manipulate the majority of votes, can prevent the various peace proposals of the Soviet Union from being passed, they cannot prevent the Soviet Union from transmitting the voice of truth to the whole world. It is precisely for this reason that the British and American blocs, which manipulate the majority of votes in the United Nations, still harbor great fear of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and often admit their failure in the propaganda struggle. The many proposals to stop war and strengthen peace submitted by the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries at previous sessions of the General Assembly and the Security Council have played a significant role in exposing and combating the imperialist conspiracy of aggression, although they have not been passed due to the unreasonable obstruction of the British and American blocs. Therefore, we must attach great importance to the struggle in the United Nations. At the same time, we should argue on the basis of reason and strive to enable representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend the United Nations, which is one of the effective ways to strengthen the United Nations' opposition to the United States' use of the United Nations to carry out aggression. Because China is one of the permanent members of the Security Council, the entry of representatives of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations can greatly strengthen the forces in the United Nations that support peace and oppose aggression.

　　联合国是怎么一回事？
    联合国是在第二次世界大战结束时产生的。按照“联合国宪章”的规定，它所应负的基本任务是“维持国际和平与安全”。
    鉴于德意日法西斯发动第二次世界大战的惨痛教训，所以当着世界反法西斯战争还在激烈进行的时候，世界各国人民即已普遍关心在战后如何维持国际和平与安全的问题。一九四三年十一月底在德黑兰苏英美三强会议中即曾研讨了战后持久和平的问题。一九四四年八月二十一日至九月二十九日，中苏美英四国代表在美国顿巴顿橡树园举行会议，草拟了“联合国”机构的组织草案。一九四五年二月克里米亚三强会议又决定了“尽早建立维持和平与安全的一般性的国际组织”。按照克里米亚会议的决定，于一九四五年四月二十五日至六月在旧金山召开了联合国会议，制订了“联合国宪章”。这个宪章明确规定了联合国组织的宗旨为“维持国际和平与安全；并为此目的，采取有效集体办法，以防止且消除对于和平之威胁，制止侵略行为或其他对和平之破坏；并以和平方法且依正义及国际法之原则，调整或解决足以破坏和平之国际争端或情势。”参加这一次会议共有五十一个国家的代表，中国解放区代表董必武也出席了这次会议。一九四六年一月在伦敦召开了联合国第一届大会，组成了联合国的各主要机构。
    截至目前为止，参加联合国的已有六十个国家。除苏联、白俄罗斯、乌克兰、波兰、捷克外，其他都是资本主义国家。而中国的席位至今仍为国民党匪帮非法占据着。
    联合国是按各国平等及大国一致的原则组织的。联合国的机构包括联合国大会、安全理事会、经济与社会理事会、托管理事会、国际法院及秘书处。此外尚有一些专门机构附属机构。
    联合国大会就是全体会员国大会，是联合国的一般议事机构，每年举行常会一次。大会职权是考虑关于维持国际和平与安全之合作的全盘政策，向会员国及安全理事会提出建议，批准新会员国入会，选举安全理事会非常任理事及经济与社会理事会理事等。在大会中每一会员国都有一投票权。大会决议的成立要有到会及投票的会员国三分之二的多数赞同。
    安全理事会是联合国中最重要的常设机构。按照联合国宪章的规定，联合国会员国把维持国际和平及安全的主要责任，授予安理会。因此，安理会具有广泛的权力，它可以调查任何争端或可能引起国际磨擦或惹起争端的情势，可以断定任何和平的威胁、和平的破坏、或侵略行为之是否存在，并可采取经济以至军事行动以防范或制止侵略行为。由中苏英法美五个常任理事国及六个非常任理事国组成。非常任理事国由联合国大会选举，任期二年，每年改选半数。关于程序事项的议案以七个理事国的可决票决定之，程序事项以外的其他一切事项的决议，则必须以包括全体常任理事国在内的七个理事国的可决票决定之，如任何一常任理事国表示反对，议案即不能通过，这就是一般所说的“否决权”。这个否决权的存在，就是为了实行宪章所规定的大国一致原则。
    经济与社会理事会，由联合国大会选出十八个会员国组成，理事任期三年，每年改选六国，每年开常会三次，一切议案有半数票即可通过。其任务为进行关于国际经济、社会、文化、教育、卫生及增进人权保障等事项的研究，并向联合国大会及会员国提出建议案。
    托管理事会的任务是处理有关托管领土的事务，如审查托管当局之报告，按期视察各托管领土等。由五强及管理托管领土的会员国家等组成。
    国际法院是联合国的主要司法机关。
    秘书处由秘书长及若干办事员组成。秘书长由大会经安全理事会的推荐委派，是联合国组织的行政首长。
    联合国组织从成立到现在已有五年。在这个长时期中，联合国组织一直处在一个十分复杂的形势下，其内部存在着两条路线的激烈斗争。以美国为首的帝国主义集团力图把联合国变作它干涉其他国家内政和进行侵略的工具，苏联及人民民主国家则根据全世界人民的利益，坚决反对帝国主义集团的这种罪恶阴谋，为保卫联合国宪章，使联合国真正担负起维持国际和平与安全的责任而奋斗。这两条路线的斗争在历届联合国大会和安理会中表现得十分明显。这种斗争一向主要地集中在裁减军备、禁止原子弹、大国一致原则等问题上。苏联在历次大会上曾提出裁减军备、禁止原子弹、缔结和平公约以消弭战争危险的和平提案，这些提案是符合全世界人民意志的，但却都为美帝国主义所操纵的多数所推翻掉。美帝国主义并且撇开联合国，违背联合国宪章，公开组织了侵略性的大西洋军事同盟。美国并在大会上操纵多数通过成立了“朝鲜临时委员会”、“巴尔干委员会”等非法组织，以实行其干涉别国内政的卑劣阴谋。在大国一致原则的问题上，美国和苏联的态度也完全相反。苏联一向坚决拥护大国一致原则，因为只有这样才能使联合国组织真正起维护世界和平与安全的作用；但美帝国主义为了使自己更便于操纵联合国，则千方百计想破坏大国一致的原则。美国曾鼓动它的附庸国在历届大会上提议取消或修改在安理会中的“否决权”的使用。为了夺取安理会的权力，美国并于一九四七年十一月在联合国大会上操纵多数通过了一个非法的“小型联大”；这个“小型联大”的特点主要是以多数表决制行使权力，便于美国控制。美国的目的是想把它当作常设机构，去代替根据大国一致原则组成的安理会。这一组织的成立，再明白不过地说明了美帝国主义破坏联合国宪章的罪恶用心。
    在中华人民共和国成立以后，中华人民共和国的代表权问题，成为联合国内的斗争中心之一。苏联及人民民主国家热烈支持中国人民的合理要求，坚持应让中华人民共和国的代表出席联合国组织，而英美集团则无理拒绝中华人民共和国的代表进入联合国，并让国民党残余匪帮非法占据着中国的席位。这样，就使联合国组织处于非法状态，不能履行其维护和平的责任。
    今年六月二十七日，美帝国主义在苏联及中华人民共和国两个常任理事国未出席的情形下，操纵安理会举行非法会议，通过了侵略朝鲜的非法决定。这个事实表示美国在明目张胆地把联合国拉向战争的道路。联合国的和平旗帜已被美国侵略者的血手所沾污。
    联合国现正举行第五届大会，安理会也在开会。在这两个会议中，正围绕着朝鲜战争问题、美国侵略台湾的问题、中华人民共和国的代表权问题及大国一致原则问题进行激烈的斗争。以美国为首的帝国主义集团正力图通过联合国来扩大侵略（十月七日联合国大会所通过的英国等八国所提出的由美国军队占领全朝鲜的提案，即表现了这一点），并进一步破坏大国一致原则（美国所提出的在必要时以联合国大会代行安理会职权的提案目的即在此），苏联及人民民主国家的代表正为制止美国的这一罪恶阴谋而进行坚决的斗争。苏联最近在大会上所提出的持久和平宣言和其他许多制止侵略的提案，就是苏联坚持和平反对战争的具体表现。
    联合国原来是一个维持国际和平与安全的组织。由于美帝国主义的操纵破坏，它现在已变得十分孱弱。在美国操纵多数票的情形下，要想使联合国通过一些合乎世界人民利益的决议，是十分困难的，甚至是不可能的。但虽然这样，联合国仍是一个重要的国际讲坛，在苏联及人民民主国家的坚持斗争下，它在制止侵略上还有一定的作用。今天世界上大多数国家尚处在反动派的统治下（正是这种情况，才使美帝国主义能够控制联合国中的多数国家，操纵联合国中的大多数票），这些国家的反动派每天每时地以各种卑劣办法欺骗人民，阻止他们明了国际时事的真象。在这种情形下，苏联及人民民主国家的代表能够通过联合国这个讲坛向全世界人民揭露英美帝国主义集团的战争阴谋，这对于促起全世界人民觉悟，提高他们与美帝国主义斗争的积极性，是有着非常重要的意义的。美英帝国主义虽然可以操纵大多数票阻止苏联的各种和平提案被通过，但却无法阻止苏联把真理的声音传向全世界。正是因为这个缘故，所以在联合国中操纵着多数票的美英集团仍对苏联及人民民主国家怀着极大恐惧，并经常承认自己在宣传斗争上的失败。苏联及人民民主国家在历届大会及安理会上所提出的许多制止战争、加强和平的提案，虽由于美英集团的无理阻挠多未获通过，但对于揭露和打击帝国主义的侵略阴谋仍起了重大的作用。所以我们必须十分重视联合国中的斗争。同时，我们应该据理力争使中华人民共和国的代表出席联合国，这是加强联合国反对美国利用联合国实行侵略的有效方法之一。因为中国是安理会常任理事国之一，中华人民共和国代表进入联合国，就可以大大加强联合国中拥护和平反对侵略的力量。
