　　The Heroic Defense of Seoul by the Korean People's Army
    Korean Central News Agency Special Correspondent
    For the freedom of the fatherland, the Korean People's Army is heroically defending Seoul, continuing the cruel and bloody battle day after day. After the American invading army landed 40,000 troops at Incheon, they suffered huge losses under the heroic counterattack of the People's Army. However, in order to seize Seoul in one fell swoop, the American invading army still attempted to struggle. The suburbs are filled with gunfire day and night, and bunkers and trenches are arranged around Seoul. In the important streets of the city, hundreds of thousands of citizens lined up, armed with weapons, and headed for the front line, guarding every street and every house, ready to shed the last drop of blood. This spirit of arduous and decisive battle represents all the commanders and fighters of the People's Army defending Seoul and all the people in the Seoul-Incheon area. They are now swearing an oath to the fatherland, determined to develop infinite loyalty and patriotic sincerity in the face of the sacred struggle.
    The People's Army and Seoul citizens fight side by side to strike the enemy
    Due to the attack of the American invading army and the heroic counterattack of the People's Army, the capital defense battle is becoming increasingly fierce. The various units of the People's Army, carrying out a valiant defensive battle, repelled and smashed the American troops advancing under the cover of aircraft, tanks, and mechanized units. The People's Army, braving the enemy's fierce bombing and concentrated shelling, broke through and destroyed the enemy's artillery positions, and defeated the enemy's tank units. Under the fierce covering fire of our artillery units, they threw grenades and incendiary bottles, engaged in a valiant hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, and thwarted the enemy's advance.
    The capital defense battle is a fierce and continuous hand-to-hand combat. The commanders and fighters of the People's Army are determined not to let the enemy occupy an inch of land. Burning with fighting spirit, they broke into the enemy's heartland, and along with the sound of grenades and incendiary bottles exploding, the American army issued desperate wails and miserable cries.
    From dawn on September 26 to the 27th, in the battles in the northern and southwestern areas of Seoul, the People's Army units killed and wounded more than 1,900 enemies, destroyed and captured countless combat equipment, and repelled the enemy by two to three kilometers. At night, the sky over Seoul twinkled with fire, and the People's Army units defending the capital and the people of the Seoul-Incheon area did not stop fighting for a second. American aircraft carried out indiscriminate bombing at night. The people in the bombed areas of Seoul launched a determined rescue and firefighting effort.
    In the night battles, the People's Army engaged in a tragic hand-to-hand combat with the American troops attempting to break through our army's positions. The sound of artillery shells shook the earth, soldiers clashed with soldiers in bayonet fighting, and in an instant, the enemy's position turned into a living hell of screams. Faced with those cowardly mercenaries who relied on numerical superiority and a large number of weapons, the People's Army units launched a bold counterattack with full confidence.
    The fierce defense of the capital continues, and the determination to dedicate oneself to the fatherland in the struggle to eliminate the enemy and shed blood connects the commanders and fighters of the People's Army and all the people.
          (Bai Wengan)
    Seoul's youth and women bravely support the People's Army
    On the western front of Seoul, a fierce hand-to-hand battle is continuing. The battle is fiercely unfolding in the west, northwest, and southwest of Seoul. Under the cover of crazy bombing and various artillery fires, the enemy cowardly crawled in behind tanks. They are most afraid of the People's Army soldiers' brave hand-to-hand combat. The People's Army soldiers gripped heavy anti-tank grenades, waiting for the enemy to approach. The anti-tank gun barrels all turned with the enemy tanks' advance. After tense minutes passed, our army's anti-tank guns began to fire at the approaching enemy tanks. For a time, the sounds of guns, artillery, and grenade explosions shook the earth. In the roaring cheers of "Defend the capital Seoul!", the People's Army combatants' counterattack began. "Defend the capital Seoul!" the combatants shouted.
    The fierce battle to defend the capital continues without stopping for an instant, day and night, in the smoke-filled air and the symphony of gunfire. The People's Army is annihilating the invading enemy. During this fierce battle, the citizens of Seoul have not stopped supporting the front line for a minute. Ammunition and equipment are continuously transported to the front line by working youth. Women's volunteer team members quickly prepare meals and distribute them to the soldiers. Emergency measures for the wounded and transportation to the rear are carried out non-stop under the enemy's rain of bullets. Youths in the Myeongdong area organized an ammunition transport team, and their work unfolded with a do-or-die spirit. Carrying heavy ammunition boxes, they walked up the highlands. Enemy counter-attack shells exploding everywhere could not stop the dedicated youths from transporting forward. With the passing of ammunition boxes on the ×× kilometer front supply road, the youth of the ammunition transport team ran forward without a second's rest. Women's volunteer team members from Wonnam-dong and Wonseo-dong made field meals in the smoke of artillery fire and delivered them to the trenches at great risk. In the capital defense battle, the People's Army units and 1.5 million Seoul citizens united with blood and love. They unfolded countless fierce and serious scenes, and the enemy lost more than 12,000 troops and countless combat equipment, suffering a major blow.
    Facing the patriotic sincerity of the capital defense forces, the People's Army commanders and fighters who swore an oath to the fatherland, and 1.5 million Seoul citizens, must carry it through to the end. Every inch of the capital's land must make the enemy pay a heavy price in blood.
          (Gao Hongji)
    The heroic battle on Ansan Heights is a vivid example
    Due to the enemy's invasion, the fierce and bloody battle of the capital Seoul has begun! Ansan (transliteration) Heights is a vital area for defending Seoul. On this height, our People's Army only has soldiers ×× and a heavy machine gun platoon to defend it. At 11:00 a.m. on September 23rd, the enemy mobilized a battalion of troops to approach the heights, attempting to occupy them. Under the cover of artillery units and aircraft, the enemy's attack was very fierce. Enemy aircraft flew at low altitude, repeatedly strafing with machine guns for two hours. The enemy artillery units also continued to fire wildly. The surroundings where our army combatants were ambushed and concealed were filled with smoke due to the explosion of enemy artillery shells and machine gun bullets. However, the People's Army all knew that this was the enemy's usual ammunition consumption before attacking.
    The combatants, in their concealed ambush positions, watched the enemy infantry units crawling up from below with burning eyes, remaining calm and motionless. After the enemy's covering shelling and machine gun strafing for an hour, the squad leader of the command post, was shot in the left chest by enemy shrapnel. In an instant, the squad leader pressed his hand on his bleeding left chest, jumped up, and shouted: "Comrades, avenge me! Fight bravely in front of the fatherland and the people! Defend the capital Seoul to the death!"
    Faced with the tragic and fierce battle, the squad leader gave the combatants his last oath. The squad leader sacrificed himself! In that deafening roar, the squad leader's last encouragement was clearly heard, arousing the flames of anger and unquenchable hatred in all the combatants. "Avenge the squad leader!" Deputy Squad Leader Li Chengyu replaced the squad leader, and all the combatants responded to his call, "Avenge! Avenge!" The tragic battle cry was shouted from the mouths of all the combatants. The enemy's stubborn shelling stopped, and the enemy infantry units climbed to within 50 meters of the front of the heights. The time for a counterattack had come. The deputy squad leader ordered to fire. The heavy machine gun began to fire in unison, filled with anger and hatred. The bullets flew over, and the enemies crawling up the slope rolled down like large stones. Some lost their minds due to the concentrated and fierce fire of the heavy machine guns and jumped over the hills holding their hands and fell down. Some knelt down, drew a cross, and fell down. The heavy machine gun spewed flames, and the enemy desperately wailed. But Deputy Squad Leader Li Chengyu was also wounded in the forehead and left wrist by enemy bullets. He gripped the heavy machine gun, his left wrist lost its strength, and the blood flowing from his forehead obscured his vision. The heavy machine gun stopped firing. Five minutes, ten minutes, time passed without waiting. The anxious combatants suddenly heard the fierce sound of the heavy machine gun again. "The deputy squad leader is still alive!" They were delighted to see the deputy squad leader, his face covered in blood and unrecognizable, holding the machine gun handle with his right hand and using his knee to shoot. The blood flowing from the deputy squad leader's forehead covered his left eye. His weak left wrist trembled at the same time as the gun's vibrations. The combatants' eyes stung. Deputy Squad Leader Li Chengyu, who continued to fire despite his serious injuries, infinitely encouraged the combatants' fighting spirit with his courageous battle. New courage welled up in their hearts. The heavy machine gun continued to fire more accurately. The enemy battalion that climbed the heights abandoned countless corpses and weapons on the foothills and slopes and fled. The enemy's attempt to occupy the heights was thwarted. The deputy squad leader was treated for his injuries at the field hospital. The unit leader told him to return to the rear, but he still wanted to go to the front line. He said: "In order to complete the glorious task of defending the capital, I am willing to fight together with my comrades."
    Deputy Squad Leader Li Chengyu strengthened the combatants' iron-like determination.
    The bright red blood permeated the bandage of Deputy Squad Leader Li Chengyu. The patriotic and noble example in the Battle of Ansan can be found everywhere in the battle to defend the capital Seoul. This is what our country's outstanding children look like.
    Today, the tens of thousands of sons and daughters of the fatherland who sacrificed themselves in the Fatherland Liberation War are aiming their guns, filled with anger and hatred, at the chests of the enemy.

　　朝鲜人民军在汉城的英勇防卫战
    朝鲜中央通讯特派员
    为了祖国的自由，朝鲜人民军英勇地守卫着汉城，连日继续着残酷的血战。美国侵略军用四万兵力登陆仁川后，在人民军部队英勇反击下，受到了巨大损失。但为了想一举占领汉城，美国侵略军仍然企图挣扎。郊外昼夜充满了枪炮声，碉堡和战壕布在汉城四围。城内重要街道上，数十万市民列队手执武器向前线开去，守卫着每条街道、每幢房屋，准备流下最后一滴血。这种坚苦决战的精神，代表着全体防卫汉城的人民军指战员和汉城仁川地区的全体人民。他们现在向祖国宣誓，决心发扬无限的忠心和爱国至诚，面对着神圣的斗争。
    人民军与汉城市民并肩作战打击敌人
    由于美国侵略军的攻击和人民军的英勇反击，首都防卫战日益激烈。进行果敢防御战的人民军各种部队击退、粉碎着在飞机、坦克机械化部队掩护下进击的美军部队。人民军冒着敌机的猛炸和集中的炮击，击破并摧毁着敌人的炮兵阵地，把敌人坦克部队挫败。在我军炮兵部队猛烈掩护射击下，投掷手榴弹和引火瓶，与敌人展开果敢的肉搏战，挫折敌人的进击。
    首都防卫战是惨烈的连续不断地肉搏战。人民军指战员誓死不让敌人侵占一寸土地。他们燃烧着斗志突入敌人心脏地带，与手榴弹引火瓶爆破声同时，美军发出了绝望的悲鸣和凄惨的呼叫。
    从九月二十六日拂晓到二十七日，在汉城北方和西南地区的战斗中，人民军部队毙伤一千九百多敌人，破坏并缴获无数的战斗器材，把敌人击退二至三公里。夜间，汉城的天空闪烁着火光，防卫首都的人民军部队和汉城、仁川地区人民，没有一秒钟间断过战斗。美军飞机于夜间进行盲目轰炸。汉城被炸地区的人民展开坚决的救护消防工作。
    在夜晚的战斗中，人民军与企图突破我军阵地的美军部队，展开凄绝的肉搏战，炮弹炸声震动了大地，士兵与士兵进行白刃交锋，一瞬间，敌人的阵地变成了呼喊连天的活地狱了。面对那些靠着数量上占优势和持有大量武器的怯懦雇佣兵，人民军部队果敢的满怀信心的展开了反突击。
    首都酷烈的防卫战继续着，为扫荡敌人和流血斗争献身祖国的决意，联系了人民军指战员和全体人民。
          （白文玕）
    汉城的青年与妇女奋勇地支援人民军
    在汉城西部的战线上，正继续着炽烈的肉搏战。战斗在汉城西部、西北、西南酷烈的展开了。敌人在疯狂轰炸和各种炮火的掩护下，躲藏在坦克后面怯懦的爬进来。他们最害怕人民军战士果敢的肉博战。人民军战士握紧沉重的反坦克手榴弹，等待着敌人迫近。反坦克的炮身炮口都随着敌人坦克的前进而转动着。紧张的几分钟过去了以后，我军反坦克炮开始射击迫近的敌军坦克，一时炮声、枪声、手榴弹爆炸声震撼着大地，在像怒涛般的万岁声中，人民军战斗员的反突击开始了。“防卫祖国首都汉城！”战斗员们高呼着。
    防卫首都的酷烈战斗，瞬间不歇，不分昼夜反复进行，在烟硝弥漫和交响的枪炮声里，人民军歼灭着侵犯的敌人。汉城市民们在这样酷烈战斗过程里，一分钟也没有停滞支援前线。弹药和器材，被劳动青年坚持陆续运输到前线。妇女义勇队队员们，尽快的做好饭食并分发给战士们。对伤兵的救急措施和后方输送工作，在敌人的弹雨下不停的进行。明洞地区青年们组织了弹药运输组，他们的工作以决死的意志展开。他们背着沉重的弹药箱向高地走上去，四处里炸裂的敌人反击炮弹，也不能挡住献身的青年们运输前进，随着弹药箱的传递。在××公里前线补给路上，弹药运输组青年们，一秒不息的跑上前去。苑南洞和苑西洞的妇女义勇队队员，在炮烟弹幕里做野战饭食并冒着极大危险送到战壕里。首都防卫战中，人民军部队和一百五十万汉城市民以血以爱团结起来了。他们展开了无数酷烈严肃的场面，敌人丧失了一万二千多名有生力量和无数战斗器材，遭受重大打击。
    面对祖国盟誓的首都防卫军人民军指战员和汉城一百五十万市民的爱国至诚，贯彻到底，首都的每一寸土地都要让敌人付出惨重的血的代价。
          （高弘济）
    安山高地英勇战斗是一个鲜明的战例
    由于敌人的侵犯，首都汉城酷烈的血战揭幕了！安山（译音）高地是防卫汉城的要地，在这高地上，我人民军不过有士兵××名重机班在固守着。九月二十三日上午十一时，敌人动员一营的兵力迫近高地，企图占领。在炮兵部队和飞机的掩护下，敌人的进攻是很猛烈的。敌机低空飞行，用机枪反复扫射继续二小时。敌人炮兵部队也疯狂的继续发射炮火。在我军战斗员埋伏隐蔽着的周围，由于敌人炮弹和机枪弹的炸裂，满布炮烟。但是，人民军都知道这是美国敌人在进击前常用的弹药耗费。
    战斗员们在埋伏隐蔽的地点，用燃烧般的眼光注视着从下面爬上来的敌人步兵部队，沉着不动。当敌人掩护炮击和机枪扫射一小时后，指挥所的第一班长，被敌人弹片射入左胸，一瞬间，班长用手按住流出鲜血的左胸，一跃而起，高呼着：“同志们，给我报仇吧！在祖国和人民面前勇敢的战斗！死守首都汉城！”
    面对着凄绝的激战，班长给了战斗员最后的誓语，班长牺牲了！在那像要震破耳膜似的爆音里，明确的听到班长的最后激励，使全体战斗员激起了火焰的愤怒和不可遏止的憎恶。“为班长报仇！”李承郁副班长代替了班长，全体战斗员响应了他的号召，“报仇！报仇！”悲壮的战斗口号从全体战斗员的口中喊出，敌人执拗的炮击停止了，敌步兵部队爬上高地正面五十公尺的近距离。反击的时候到了。副班长下了命令射击，重机一致的猛击开始了，充满愤怒和憎恶的枪弹飞过去，从斜坡上爬上来的敌人，像大石头般的滚下去，有的是由于重机的集中猛烈射击而失神的举着手跃过小丘跌下去了，有的是跪下画着十字而倒下去了。重机枪喷着火焰，敌人绝望地在悲鸣。可是李承郁副班长也被敌弹射伤了前额和左腕。他握着重机把左腕失掉力量，从额上流下的鲜血遮住了视线，重机射击停止了，五分、十分，时间不等待的过去了。着急的战斗员们忽然又听到了猛烈的重机枪声。“副班长还健在！”他们欢喜的看见了鲜血满面分不清鼻眼的副班长，右手把着机枪把手，用膝盖去射击了。从副班长额上流下的鲜血掩住他的左眼。无力的左腕和枪声的震动同时颤抖了，战斗员们的眼睛发酸了，不顾重伤而射击到底的副班长李承郁以他的奋勇的战斗无限的鼓励了战斗员的斗志，他们心中涌出新的勇气，重机继续着更命中的射击，爬上高地的敌人一营在山麓和斜路一带抛弃了无数尸体和武器逃跑了，敌人要占领高地的企图被挫折了。副班长在野战病院治疗了伤处，部队长叫他回后方去，但他仍愿到前线，他说：“为完成防卫首都的光荣任务，愿与同志们共同战斗。”
    李承郁副班长使战斗员加强铁石般的决心。
    鲜红的血透过绷带的李承郁副班长在安山战斗的爱国的崇高榜样，在防卫首都汉城战斗中，到处可以找到这种例子，这就是我们祖国优秀儿女的样子。
    在祖国解放战争中献身的成千成万的祖国儿女们，今天把充满着愤怒和憎恶的枪弹，瞄准仇敌的胸膛倾注了。
