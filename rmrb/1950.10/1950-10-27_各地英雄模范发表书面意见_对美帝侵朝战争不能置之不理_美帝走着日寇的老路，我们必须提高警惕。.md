　　Heroes and Model Workers Across the Country Issue Written Statements:
    We Cannot Ignore the US Imperialist Aggression Against Korea
    US Imperialism is Following the Old Path of Japanese寇, We Must Be Vigilant.
    Combat Hero Ma Chunyu Says:
    The Sound of the Guns Invading Korea Shakes Our Hearts Every Day, We Can Never Tolerate It.
    Ma Chunyu, the combat hero who is the instructor of the Second Company of a cavalry division stationed in a certain area and attended the National Combat Heroes Representative Meeting, wrote to this newspaper, saying: Since 1946, the shells manufactured by US imperialism have been blooming everywhere on Chinese soil. Countless Chinese revolutionary martyrs, Chinese people's parents, sons, and daughters have died under the shells manufactured by US imperialism. We cannot forget the blood debt owed to us by US imperialism. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the good sons and daughters of the Chinese people defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries aided by US imperialism and exchanged blood and sweat for victory. However, US imperialism has again come to arm and invade our territory of Taiwan and bomb our northeastern border, and the Chinese people have shed fresh blood that cannot be tolerated. We have recorded new hatred with US imperialism that cannot be resolved.
    The sound of guns in Korea shakes our hearts every day. The brutal massacre of peaceful Korean residents by US imperialism reminds us even more of the atrocities of the Japanese fascists in massacring the Chinese people. We can never tolerate this beastly behavior of US imperialism!
    If any imperialism wants to eat the fruits of the Chinese people's victory, we will smash its dog head. We want peace, but we are not afraid of war. We are the People's Liberation Army, resolutely defending world peace, and we are the strength of the people of the world. We resolutely oppose the aggressive actions of US imperialism in Korea! If US imperialism dares to burn the flames of war onto our territory, we will surely destroy it in the flames!
    Industrial Model Worker Zhen Rongdian Believes:
    US Imperialism is Frantically Expanding its War of Aggression, the Chinese Working Class Must Defeat its Provocations!
    Industrial model worker Zhen Rongdian, who attended the National Model Workers Representative Meeting, issued a written statement saying:
    US imperialism, this mad dog, is becoming more and more frantic. In order to save its disastrous defeat on the Korean battlefield, it has spared no effort to mobilize all the American troops it can mobilize in the Far East to launch the biggest adventure. It landed at Incheon, occupied Seoul, and crossed the "38th parallel" in an attempt to burn the flames of war to our border and expand the invasion. US imperialism has continuously used airplanes to invade our airspace and bomb and strafe our peaceful residents. At the United Nations General Assembly, it used its voting machine to pass the aggressive proposal of eight countries, including Britain and Australia, vetoed the peaceful proposal of five countries, including the Soviet Union, and attempted to list our Taiwan as the "Formosa issue" on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly to interfere in our internal affairs and violate our sovereignty in the name of the United Nations. Recently, the mad dog bosses Truman and MacArthur held some secret talks in the Pacific and made arrangements to expand the war of aggression.
    We cannot let this mad dog destroy world peace. The US imperialist war of aggression against Korea threatens the security of our country from the very beginning. Our neighbor, the peaceful residents of Korea, have suffered the ravages of US imperialism, and we must not ignore this crazy behavior of US imperialism. We must support the Korean people in opposing US imperialist aggression. Taiwan is our territory, and we will never allow US imperialism to invade it. US imperialism has strafed and bombed our lives and property with airplanes, and we will never tolerate it. All the aggressive resolutions passed by US imperialism manipulating the United Nations are illegal, and the people of the world do not recognize them.
    We need peace, but we are not afraid of resisting the war of aggression launched by US imperialism. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party, our working class and the people of the whole country have defeated Chiang Kai-shek, who was aided by US imperialism. If US imperialism still wants to follow the old path of Japanese imperialism, good! Our working class will definitely use our strength to defeat the aggressive provocations of US imperialism!
    Railway Model Workers Tian Yunhua and Li Yonglu Said:
    We Have Seen Through the Aggressive Ambitions of US Imperialism
    We Want to Support Korea in Resisting US Imperialist Aggression
    Tian Yunhua, a railway labor model who attended the Labor Model Representative Meeting, issued a written statement saying: US imperialism bites people like a mad dog. It is stepping up the expansion of its war of aggression, attempting to follow the old path of Japanese invaders in invading Asia and China to enslave the Chinese people. However, the Chinese people have long seen through the ambitions of US imperialism and have long known their conspiracy and tricks. We have the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the invincible People's Liberation Army, and a strong and united people. We will definitely be able to smash the dog heads of the US imperialist aggressors with iron hammers. We, the working class, are the most progressive. Our model heroes will definitely take the lead in using practical production actions to strengthen national defense and improve vigilance, and always pay attention to the enemy's conspiracies and activities. We have the confidence to defend world peace and consolidate our victory.
    Li Yonglu, a railway labor model who attended the National Labor Model Representative Meeting, said: US imperialism is now expanding its war of aggression, crossing the "38th parallel" in Korea, and bombing the peaceful residents of Andong several times, injuring our railway workers, and burning the flames of war to the Chinese border. We Chinese people firmly support world peace, but we want to warn the imperialists that we are not afraid of war. If anyone dares to launch any aggressive provocations, we have the confidence to defeat them.
    Korea is our neighboring brotherly country, and we have the right and the obligation to support it in resisting US imperialist aggression. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we Chinese workers will become more united and work hard to consolidate our national defense and economic construction.

　　各地英雄模范发表书面意见
    对美帝侵朝战争不能置之不理
    美帝走着日寇的老路，我们必须提高警惕。
    战斗英雄马春雨说：
    侵略朝鲜的炮声，每日都震动着我们的心，我们决难忍受。
    驻防某地的骑兵师第二连指导员、出席全国战斗英雄代表会议的战斗英雄马春雨致函本报表示：自从一九四六年以来，美帝制造的炮弹，在中国的大地上到处开花。中国革命的先烈们、中国人民的父母子女们，不知道多少人死在美帝制造的炮弹下。我们不能忘记美帝国主义欠下我们的这笔血债。中国人民的好儿女在毛主席的英明领导下，打垮了美帝援助的国民党反动派，用血汗换来了胜利。但是，美帝又来武装侵略我国领土台湾，轰炸我东北边疆，中国人民又流出了不能忍受的鲜血，我们又与美帝记下了不能解开的新仇。
    朝鲜的炮声，每日震动着我们的心。朝鲜和平居民惨遭美帝屠杀，让我们更记起日本法西斯屠杀中国人民的暴行。美帝这种野兽般的行为，我们绝不能忍受！
    任何帝国主义要吃中国人民的胜利果实，我们就打掉他的狗头。我们愿意和平，但是我们并不害怕战争。我们是坚决保卫世界和平的解放军，我们是全世界人民的力量。我们坚决反对美帝在朝鲜的侵略行为！如果美帝胆敢把战火烧向我们的国土，我们一定要它在火焰中毁灭！
    工业劳模甄荣典认为：
    美帝疯狂扩大侵略战争，中国工人阶级一定要打败它的挑衅！
    出席全国劳模代表会议的工业劳模甄荣典发表书面意见说：
    美帝这条疯狗，愈来愈疯狂了，在朝鲜战场上为了挽救他的惨败，不惜一切代价调集了所有在远东所能调用的美国军队，发动最大的冒险。仁川登陆，侵占汉城，并越过“三八”线，企图将战火燃烧到我国的边境，扩大侵略。美帝连续不断地用飞机来侵犯我国领空，轰炸扫射我国和平居民。在联合国大会上，他利用表决机器，通过了英澳等八国侵略提案，否决了苏联等五国所提和平提案，并企图将我国台湾称为“福摩萨问题”，列入联合国大会议程，用联合国名义来干涉我国内政，侵犯我国主权。最近疯狗头子杜鲁门和麦克阿瑟在太平洋举行什么秘谈，作了扩大侵略战争的布署。
    我们不能让这只疯狗来破坏世界和平。美帝侵略朝鲜战争，一开始便威胁着我们国家的安全。我们近邻朝鲜和平居民，遭受了美帝的蹂躏，我们决不能对美帝这种疯狂的行动置之不理，我们一定要支援朝鲜人民反对美帝侵略。台湾是我们国土，决不允许美帝国主义来侵犯。美帝用飞机扫射、轰炸了我们的生命财产，我们决不能容忍下去。美帝操纵联合国所通过的一切侵略决议，都是非法的，世界人民是不承认的。
    我们需要和平，但是我们也不怕反抗美帝发动的侵略战争，我们工人阶级和全国人民在中国共产党毛主席领导下已战胜了美帝援助的蒋介石，若美帝还想走日本帝国主义的老路，好！我们工人阶级一定用我们的力量来打败美帝的侵略挑衅！
    铁路劳模田蕴华、李永禄表示
    我们已看破了美帝的侵略野心
    我们要支援朝鲜反抗美帝侵略
    出席劳模代表会议的铁路劳动模范田蕴华发表书面意见说：美帝国主义像疯狗一样的咬人，他正加紧扩大侵略战争，企图走日寇侵略亚洲和中国的老路，来奴役中国人民。但是中国人民早已看破了美帝国主义的野心，早就知道他们的阴谋鬼计，我们有毛主席和共产党的正确领导，有不可战胜的解放军，有坚强团结一致的人民，我们一定能够用铁锤打烂美帝侵略者的狗头。我们工人阶级是最进步的，我们模范功臣一定带头用实际的生产行动，加强国防，并提高警惕性，随时注意敌人的阴谋活动。我们有信心保卫世界和平，巩固我们的胜利。
    出席全国劳模代表会议的铁路劳动模范李永禄说：美帝国主义现在正扩大侵略战争，在朝鲜越过“三八”线，并几次的轰炸我安东和平居民，炸伤我铁路职工，将战争的火焰燃烧到中国边境。我们中国人民是坚决拥护世界和平的，但我们要警告帝国主义者，我们并不害怕战争，如果谁敢发动任何侵略的挑衅，我们有信心将它打败。
    朝鲜是我们邻邦兄弟国家，我们有权利也有义务来支援它反抗美帝的侵略。我们中国工人在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，会更加团结一致，为巩固我们的国防及经济建设而努力。
