　　China is One of the Main Forces for Peace
    Wang Yunsheng
    Great China, possessing a quarter of the world's population, is creative and peace-loving. In the nearly fourteen years of the Anti-Japanese War, the Liberation War, and the nation-building efforts, it overthrew the aggression of Japanese imperialism, overthrew the joint rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, achieved the liberation of 475 million people, and built its new nation. This turning over of a quarter of the world's population, making them masters of their own destiny, is a major event in human history. Moreover, our participation in the world peace and democracy camp led by the socialist Soviet Union has further strengthened the forces defending world peace. China is one of the main forces for peace, which is an unshakable fact.

    Great China will certainly make the greatest efforts and faithful contributions to the peace and happiness of mankind. We oppose aggression, and we will never allow the imperialists to occupy our Taiwan; we must recover Taiwan. We support peace, and we will never allow the United Nations organization, originally intended to maintain world peace, to become a tool of imperialist aggression policies. Therefore, the People's Republic of China must participate in the United Nations organization and exercise the "great power unanimity" authority to maintain world peace. These two points are what we must strive to implement, and they are precisely our faithful responsibilities in opposing aggression and defending peace.

    The China Peace Defense World Congress has been established for a year, and we would like to first put forward these two points as the goals for our struggle.

　　中国是和平主力之一
    王芸生
    伟大的中国，拥有全世界四分之一的人口，能创作，爱和平。在近十四年来的抗日战争，解放战争与建国工作中，打倒了日本帝国主义的侵略，打倒了帝国主义，封建主义与官僚资本主义的联合统治，取得了四亿七千五百万人民的解放，建设了自己的新国家。这世界四分之一的人口的翻身，作了掌握自己命运的主人，是人类历史上的大事情。我们并且参加了社会主义的苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，就更壮大了保卫世界和平的力量。中国是和平主力之一，已是不可动摇的事实。
    伟大的中国，必将为人类的和平幸福尽最大的努力，作忠实的贡献。我们反对侵略，我们绝不容帝国主义者霸占我们的台湾，我们必要收回台湾；我们拥护和平，我们也绝不容原为维持世界和平的联合国组织变为帝国主义侵略政策的工具，因此我中华人民共和国必要参加联合国组织，行使为维持世界和平的“大国一致”的职权。这两点是我们必求贯彻的，也正是我们忠实于反对侵略保卫和平的职责。
    中国保卫世界和平大会成立一周年了，我们谨先揭举这两点以为奋斗的目标。
