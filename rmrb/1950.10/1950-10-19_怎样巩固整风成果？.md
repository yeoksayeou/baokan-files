　　How to Consolidate the Achievements of the Rectification Campaign?
    After the rectification campaign in leading organs comes to a conclusion, forces should be organized immediately to go deep into the grassroots to inspect work. This is one of the important methods for leading organs to consolidate the achievements of the rectification campaign. The news published today about the Northeast going deep into the grassroots to inspect work illustrates such a problem.
    The method of consolidating the achievements of the rectification campaign is, first of all, to formulate some systems within the organs to improve work, so that the important problems discovered in the rectification campaign, such as: blindness and one-sidedness in the implementation of policies, weak mass viewpoint, not being good at consulting with the masses, etc., can be gradually corrected in the work, or prevented from continuing to occur. Another news item we published today – that the directly subordinate organs of Hebei Province have formulated various necessary systems, strengthened Party life, and consolidated the achievements of the rectification campaign – this method is very necessary. However, it is not enough to limit ourselves to this method. The Northeast's rectification experience proposes that "in order to make these methods fit the specific situation below, it is necessary to go down to inspect work, and it is necessary to summarize the experience of the masses and promote it." This is a more important method to ensure the further expansion and consolidation of the achievements of the rectification campaign. The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, in coordination with the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, organized working groups after the industrial rectification meeting to go deep into factories and mines to implement the resolutions of the industrial rectification meeting and create experience in improving business management. Although this is only a beginning, it can be affirmed that its results will be more effective than sitting in the office and formulating plans to improve work.
    Secondly, in order to consolidate the achievements of the rectification campaign, the leading organs must help the lower-level organs to carry out rectification. This rectification campaign is being carried out from top to bottom. When the rectification of the leading organs has initially ended, it is the time when the rectification of the lower-level organs is beginning or is in the process of checking and summarizing the work. At this time, the leading organs can go deep into the lower levels to inspect work, which can help the lower levels to check work, analyze the situation, and solve problems in a timely and concrete manner. Only in this way can we ensure that all the correct instructions and systems formulated by the higher-level leading organs can be implemented. Otherwise, even if the ideological style of the leading organs is very correct and the work policy is also very correct, if the shortcomings of the lower-level organs are not overcome, then everything is still empty.
    We should make this kind of going deep into the lower levels to inspect work a regular system. Stalin pointed out in his discussion on leadership and inspection that the main thing in organizational work is to select personnel and review the implementation. At the same time, he pointed out that this review should be systematic rather than accidental, and that the people who carry out the inspection must be leaders with prestige, not secondary figures. We must always remember and conscientiously implement this beneficial teaching.

### 怎样巩固整风成果？

　　怎样巩固整风成果？
    在领导机关的整风运动告一段落后，应该立即组织力量，深入基层，检查工作，这是领导机关巩固整风成果的重要方法之一。今天发表的东北深入基层检查工作的消息中就说明了这样一个问题。
    巩固整风成果的方法，首先是在机关内部制定出一些改进工作的制度，使整风中所发现的重要问题，如：执行政策上的盲目性与片面性、群众观点薄弱、不善于和群众商量等等，能够在工作中逐渐纠正，或防止其继续发生。今天我们发表的另一个消息——河北省直属机关制定各种必要制度，加强党内生活，巩固整风成果，这个方法是很必需的。但是，仅仅限于这个方法是不够的。东北整风经验中提出“为了使这些办法切合下面具体情况，就必须下去检查工作，必须总结群众中的经验加以推广。”这是保证整风所得成果进一步扩大与巩固的更重要的方法。中共中央东北局协同东北人民政府工业部及东北总工会，在工业整风会议之后，组织工作组，深入厂矿，贯彻工业整风会议的决议，创造改进经营管理的经验。这虽然只是一个开始，但是，可以肯定它的结果是会比坐在机关里制定改进工作计划更有成效。
    其次，领导机关为巩固整风成果，必须帮助下级机关进行整风。此次整风运动正是自上而下逐级进行的。在领导机关整风初步结束时，正是下级机关整风开始或正在进行检查总结工作的时候。领导机关在这时深入下层检查工作，正可以适时地具体帮助下级检查工作，分析情况，解决问题。也只有这样，才能保证上级领导机关所制定的一切正确的指示、制度能够贯彻下去。否则，即使领导机关的思想作风都很端正了，工作方针也很正确了，但是下级机关的缺点照旧没有克服，那末一切都还是空的。
    我们应该使这种深入下层检查工作，成为一种经常的制度。斯大林论领导与检查中指出：在组织工作中主要的是挑选人员和审查执行情形。同时指出这种审查应该是有系统的而不是偶然的，执行检查的人必须是有威信的领导者，而不是次要的人物。我们必须时时记取并认真执行这个有益的教诲。
