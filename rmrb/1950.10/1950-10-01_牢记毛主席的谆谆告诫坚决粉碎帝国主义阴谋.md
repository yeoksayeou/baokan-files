　　Firmly Remember Chairman Mao's Earnest Admonitions and Resolutely Smash Imperialist Conspiracies
　　Hua Dong Military Region, Third Field Army Shooting Hero Wei Laiguo
　　At this time last year, I gloriously participated in the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and personally attended the founding ceremony.
　　From that time on, a new history of the people began. The Central People's Government headed by Chairman Mao, representing the interests of the people, was established, and the Common Program, the founding charter of the Chinese people, was promulgated. From then on, the Chinese people truly became masters of history. "One-quarter of humanity stood up from then on."
　　Looking back at that time, I was encouraged by this unprecedented great victory of the Chinese people. I clearly saw the bright and brilliant future of the new China. At the same time, I personally received Chairman Mao's earnest admonition: "Our revolutionary work is not yet complete. The People's Liberation War and the People's Revolutionary Movement are still developing. We must continue to work hard. The imperialists and domestic reactionaries are by no means reconciled to their defeat, and they will make a final struggle. Even after the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, and they will attempt to restore [their power] in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and beyond doubt, and we must not relax our vigilance." I will never forget Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions.
　　The anniversary of the National Day has arrived, and the past year has fully confirmed Chairman Mao's genius prediction.
　　On National Day, like the people of the whole country and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, I congratulate with incomparable excitement and joy, pay tribute to the Chinese people! Pay tribute to the Communist Party Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu! Pay tribute to the Central People's Government!
　　In the past year of the Chinese People's Liberation War, except for Taiwan and Tibet, which are yet to be liberated, the Chinese mainland has been unified, and the war has achieved a basic victory. When our Liberation War was approaching complete victory, the U.S. imperialists dared to invade our sacred territory of Taiwan and twice bombed our northeast border, causing dozens of our compatriots to sacrifice under U.S. planes. China's territory will never allow foreign aggressors to invade. Our People's Liberation Army, with the support of the people of the whole country, is fully prepared to liberate Taiwan and Tibet from the hands of the U.S. imperialist aggressors and defeat any provocations by the imperialists. Look! The claws of imperialism will be cut off by the sharp blades of the heroic and good-at-war People's Liberation Army, which is famous throughout the world!
　　In the past year, I have seen the peaceful construction of the new China unfold, finance and economy unified, revenue and expenditure close to balance, and prices stabilized. Preliminary achievements have been made in various aspects such as rationally adjusting industry and commerce, improving public-private relations and labor-capital relations, and tax work. These thriving signs of the new China's peaceful construction have already made us see the bright future of a basic improvement in the country's financial and economic situation. However, the Chinese people's first and most vicious enemy, U.S. imperialism, is not reconciled to failure. It is directing and colluding with Kuomintang special agents to actively sabotage our national construction. Our People's Liberation Army has the responsibility to participate in national peaceful construction and defend national defense. We are determined, together with the people of the whole country, to resolutely eliminate the leading evil elements who sabotage and disrupt the revolution in order to remove obstacles to the restoration and development of national construction. The imperialists' conspiracies of sabotage and disruption will inevitably be crushed under the iron fists of the Chinese people, who have rich revolutionary struggle experience with long-term victories!
　　In the past year, our country has received strong assistance from international friends, especially the Soviet Union. The victory of our economic construction is inseparable from the sympathy and assistance of the people of the world, especially the Soviet people. From then on, it made me more aware that the working people of the world are one family, who are our enemies, and who are our friends. Further understanding that: "As long as we adhere to the people's democratic dictatorship and unite international friends, we can quickly achieve victory on the economic front." In the future, I will stand on my job post, and together with the people of the whole country, strive for the basic improvement of the national finance and economy, defend the new China and the peace and happiness of the people all over the world.

　　牢记毛主席的谆谆告诫  坚决粉碎帝国主义阴谋
    华东军区、三野射击英雄  魏来国
    去年此时，我光荣地参加了中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议，并躬逢开国盛典。
    从那时，人民的新历史开始了，代表人民利益的以毛主席为首的中央人民政府成立了，中国人民的建国大宪章共同纲领颁布了，从此，中国人民真正做了历史的主人，“占人类总数四分之一的中国人从此站立起来了。”
    回忆当时，我为中国人民的这一空前伟大胜利鼓舞着。我清楚地看到了新中国的光辉灿烂的前途，同时我亲身领受了毛主席的谆谆告诫：“我们的革命工作还没有完结，人民解放战争和人民革命运动还在向前发展，我们还要继续努力。帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”我永远不会忘记毛主席的英明指示。
    国庆周年纪念到来了，一年来，完全证实了毛主席的天才预见。
    在国庆节的时候，我和全国人民及人民解放军全体指战员一样，以无比兴奋愉快的心情祝贺，向中国人民致敬！向共产党毛主席、朱总司令致敬！向中央人民政府致敬！
    一年来中国人民解放战争，除了台湾、西藏尚待解放外，中国大陆已经统一，战争取得了基本胜利，在我解放战争接近全部胜利的时候，美帝国主义者竟胆敢侵略我国的神圣领土台湾，并两度空袭我东北边疆，致使我数十个同胞牺牲在美机之下。中国的领土绝不容许外国侵略者侵犯的，我们人民解放军正在全国人民支援下，充分准备从美帝侵略者手中解放台湾和西藏，打败帝国主义者的任何挑衅。看吧！帝国主义的魔爪，将被英勇善战驰名世界的人民解放军的利刃斩断！
    一年来，我看到了新中国的和平建设开展了，财政经济统一了，收支接近平衡了，物价稳定了，在合理的调整工商业，改善公私关系和劳资关系以及税收工作等各方面，都有了初步成绩。这些新中国和平建设的欣欣向荣的气象，已经使我们看见了国家财政经济状况基本好转的光明前途。可是，中国人民第一个也是最凶的敌人——美帝国主义者是不甘心失败的，它正在指使勾结国民党特务积极破坏我们的国家建设，我们人民解放军有责任参加国家和平建设，和保卫国防。我们决心和全国人民一道，坚决肃清匪特破坏捣乱革命的首恶分子，以铲除恢复和发展国家建设的障碍。帝国主义者的捣乱破坏的阴谋，也必然要在有长期胜利的丰富革命斗争经验的中国人民的铁拳下粉碎！
    一年来，我们的国家得到国际友人首先是苏联的有力援助，我们经济建设的胜利是和世界人民首先是苏联人民的同情和援助分不开的。从此，使我更加认识了天下劳动人民是一家，谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友。进一步认识了：“只要我们坚持人民民主专政和团结国际友人，我们就能在经济战线上迅速地获得胜利。”今后我将站在我的工作岗位上，和全国人民一道，争取全国财政经济的基本好转，保卫新中国和全世界人民的和平与幸福。
