　　In Memory of Bi Shishi
    Xiao Jinguang
    The passing of Comrade Bi Shishi is a great loss to our Party and the people. The Chinese people have lost a great warrior and statesman, and the Party has lost a brilliant organizer and leader.
    The passing of Comrade Bi Shishi is especially painful for me – someone who studied with Comrade Bi Shishi, left school to join the revolution together, went to the Soviet Union to study together, and engaged in thirty years of revolutionary struggle under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and who received much guidance from Comrade Bi Shishi.
    As early as his youth, Comrade Bi Shishi displayed the noble qualities and steadfast character of a great revolutionary fighter.
    Comrade Bi Shishi's family was poor in his childhood, and his mother struggled to make ends meet with the meager income from her business. Therefore, when Comrade Bi Shishi was studying at the First Middle School of Changsha County, he had great difficulty paying tuition each time, scraping together what he could, and ultimately relying on the wages earned by Comrade Chen Congying – then Comrade Bi Shishi's fiancée – working in a factory to make it through. But poverty did not discourage Comrade Bi Shishi; it tempered his noble character and revolutionary will. In school, Comrade Bi Shishi only wanted to associate with those poor students, and that is how we became close friends.
    When Comrade Bi Shishi was studying in Changsha, it was during the time when the May Fourth Movement was sweeping the country. At this time, Chairman Mao led and carried out extensive revolutionary activities in Hunan. The *Xiang River Review*, edited by Chairman Mao, spread a tremendous revolutionary influence. It was under the influence of this revolutionary movement that we began our revolutionary awakening. At that time, we did not know much about communism, but we were filled with an irrepressible hatred for imperialism and the traitorous government of the time. The great communist Comrade Bi Shishi thus began his revolutionary activities as a resolute anti-imperialist and anti-traitorous government revolutionary fighter.
    In the summer of 1920, Comrade Bi Shishi graduated from the First Middle School of Changsha County. At that time, we did not clearly know that the path we should take was that of a revolutionary professional, and the question of "a way out" after graduation was a troubling one. The originally hoped-for opportunity to study in France through work-study programs had already been missed. In order to solve this "way out" problem and save the round-trip travel expenses to go home for the summer vacation, Comrade Bi Shishi and I stayed at the school when the other students went home for the summer. I would like to mention here in passing that Comrade Bi Shishi was a person with many talents in his youth. One day, as we were walking down the street, we happened to notice a portrait studio. Comrade Bi Shishi bought some charcoal ink and paper, and when he returned to the dormitory, he began to draw. The first drawing was not satisfactory, but when the second drawing was finished, he took it to the front of the portrait studio and compared it with the portraits hanging there. It was clearly visible that it was much better than the portraits in the studio. Later, when Comrade Bi Shishi was assigned to work for the Party in Wuhan, he even used portrait drawing as a cover for his secret work. I remember that when Comrade Bi Shishi discovered his artistic talent, he once said that although the doors of social professions were closed to a student who had just come out of school, it seemed not difficult to make a living with a special skill. However, Comrade Bi Shishi did not regard merely being able to make a personal living in the old society as his way out, and that was not the way out we were troubled by at the time. One day, Comrade Bi Shishi came back from the street, looking very excited. As soon as he entered the door, he said to me, "There is a way!" I asked what way, and he replied, "Go to Russia!" Go to Russia! How exciting that was for us at the time! We didn't know much about Russia, but wasn't that where the old society was overthrown and a new society was established! This "thorough" "overthrow of the old society" was the concentrated expression of all revolutionary significance for young people like us who were filled with hatred for imperialism and the traitorous government. Comrade Bi Shishi made his decision without hesitation. Through the introduction of the revolutionary organization led by Chairman Mao, we went to Shanghai together to study Russian. It was at this time that Comrade Bi Shishi and I joined the Socialist Youth League together.
    Going to Russia was not an easy thing at the time. Comrade Bi Shishi was only sixteen years old at the time, and I, who was traveling with him, was also about the same age. We had to pretend not to know each other on the road, one posing as a barber and the other as a tailor. At that time, the Soviet Union was in a period of intense civil war, and the Far Eastern border area was still occupied by Japanese imperialism and White bandit gangs. When we passed through the "red and white zone" from Vladivostok to Boli (Khabarovsk), we encountered strict inspections by Japanese imperialism and White bandit gangs. I was fortunate enough to pass through, but Comrade Bi Shishi was detained by the White bandit gangs under the pretext of being a "plague patient" and was locked up in the "plague patient" detention room. This was really a big blow to me at the time. I arrived in Boli full of anxiety, but two days later, Comrade Bi Shishi was released by the White bandit gangs because they believed he "did not have the plague" and rushed to Boli. Such an experience was not uncommon for a revolutionary, but the calm and steadfast revolutionary character displayed by Comrade Bi Shishi, who was only sixteen years old at the time, left me with a permanently indelible impression. In the subsequent thirty years of revolutionary struggle, the great communist Comrade Bi Shishi consistently demonstrated the noble spirit of a great revolutionary fighter who was steadfast and unyielding, even under the cruel torture and persecution of the enemy.
    Comrade Bi Shishi has unfortunately passed away, but the great contributions of Comrade Bi Shishi who dedicated himself to the great revolutionary cause of China's national liberation, people's liberation, and the liberation of the working class for thirty years will be immortal!

　　悼弼时
    萧劲光
    弼时同志的逝世，是我党和人民的一个极大的损失，中国人民失去了一个伟大战士和政治家，党失去了一个天才的组织家和领导者。
    弼时同志的逝世，对于我自己——一个曾经与弼时同志一道读书，一道离开学校参加革命，一道去苏联学习，在毛主席领导下共同从事了三十年的革命斗争而又从弼时同志得到很多教益的人，特别感到悲痛。
    远在少年时代的弼时同志，就显示了后来做为一个伟大革命战士的崇高品质和坚毅性格。
    弼时同志幼年家贫，靠母亲一个人所经营的一点微薄家产，维持生活已感困难。因此，弼时同志在长沙县立第一中学读书的时候，每次交学费都发生很大的困难，东筹西凑，最后还得靠弼时同志的夫人陈琮英同志——那时还是弼时同志的未婚妻——在工厂做工所得到的一点工资来补助，才能勉强度得过去。但是穷困并不能挫折弼时同志，穷困砥砺了弼时同志的崇高品质和革命意志。弼时同志在学校中只愿意跟那些贫苦同学接近，而我们正是这样成了亲密朋友的。
    弼时同志在长沙读书的时候，正是五四运动波及全国的时候，这时毛主席在湖南领导和开展了广泛的革命活动。毛主席主编的《湘江评论》传播了巨大的革命影响。我们正是在这个革命运动的影响下开始了革命觉悟的。那时，我们对于共产主义知道得还不多，而对于帝国主义和当时的卖国政府则是充满了不可抑遏的仇恨。伟大的共产主义者弼时同志就是这样以一个坚决反帝国主义反卖国政府的革命战士开始了自己的革命活动。
    一九二○年暑假，弼时同志在长沙县立第一中学毕业了。那时我们还不明确知道我们所应走的道路是一个革命职业家的道路，毕业后的“出路”问题是一个苦恼问题。原来想望的勤工俭学留法，机会已经错过了。为着这个“出路”问题和节省暑期回家来往的路费，当着同学们都回家过暑假的时候，弼时同志和我留在学校了。我想在这里顺便提到一下，弼时同志在青年时代是一个具有多方面才能的人，有一天，我们在街上走过，偶而注意到了一个画像馆，弼时同志买了一点炭墨和纸，回到宿舍就画起来了，第一张画得不满意，第二张画成时拿到画像馆门前与那里所悬挂着的画像对照了一下，竟可以明显看得出比那画像馆的画像要高明得多。直到后来弼时同志被派到武汉做党的工作时，还曾以画像做为秘密工作的掩护。记得当时弼时同志发现了自己的绘画才能时曾经说，虽然社会职业的门对于一个刚从学校出来的学生都是关闭着的，而凭了一技之长似乎也不难活下去，但是弼时同志并不把只要能够在旧社会谋得个人生活做为自己的出路，而我们当时所苦恼的并不是这样的一个出路。有一天，弼时同志从街上回来，样子极兴奋，一进门就对我说：“有办法了”！我问什么办法，回答是“到俄国去”！到俄国去！这在当时对我们是一个多末大的激动！对于俄国，我们知道得并不多，那里不是推翻了旧社会建立了新社会么！这个“彻底推翻旧社会”的“彻底”，对于当时像我们那样对帝国主义和卖国政府充满仇恨的青年，乃是全部革命意义的集中表现。弼时同志毫不迟疑地下定了决心，经过了毛主席所领导的革命组织的介绍，我们一同到达上海去学俄文。就在这个时候，弼时同志和我一同参加了社会主义青年团。
    到俄国去在当时并不是一件容易的事。那时弼时同志才十六岁，而随他同行的我也是差不多一般大的年龄，只是我们两个人，在路上还要装做互不相识，一个扮做理发工人，一个扮做裁缝工人。那时苏联正处在紧张的国内战争时期，远东边疆地带还为日本帝国主义和白党匪徒所盘踞，当我们通过由海参威到伯力的“赤白交界”地区时，遇到了日本帝国主义和白党匪徒的严厉检查，我侥幸得以通过了，弼时同志却被以“鼠疫患者”的借口为白党匪徒扣押了，并被关进了“鼠疫患者”的拘禁室里去。这在当时对我实在是一个很大的打击，我满怀焦虑地到达了伯力，但过了两天，弼时同志被白党匪徒认为“没有鼠疫”而脱身赶到了伯力了。这样的遭遇对于一个革命者来说原不算是稀有的事，但那时还只有十六岁的弼时同志所表现的镇静和坚毅的革命性格，留给了我一个永久不可磨灭的印象。在以后三十年的革命斗争中，伟大的共产主义者弼时同志虽屡次在敌人的酷刑迫害之下，都一贯地表现了坚贞不屈的伟大革命战士的高尚精神。
    弼时同志不幸逝世了，但弼时同志三十年来献身于中国的民族解放、人民解放和工人阶级解放的伟大革命事业的伟大功勋，将永垂不朽！
