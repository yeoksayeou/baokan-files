　　The Communist Party of Great Britain fights to defend peace
    Written for the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of Great Britain
    By Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain

    Our Communist Party was founded on July 31, 1920, and this July 31 marked its thirtieth anniversary.

    In the past thirty years, the Communist Party of Great Britain has traveled a long and glorious road of class struggle, fighting against all open capitalist enemies and right-wing elements in the labor movement. In the working class's struggle against the capitalist system, these right-wing elements have consistently attempted to destroy and confuse the ranks of the working class.

    Today, the history of our Communist Party has become an important part of the history of the labor movement, because in these thirty years, there has been a series of events, struggles, and victories in which our Party has proudly maintained the finest traditions of the British working class.

    Our Party, which started small and in unfavorable circumstances, has been forged into a new type of working-class party, and today, no force can split or destroy it.

    Our Party comrades have never thought about personal gain or status, either in the past or today. People who see the labor movement as a stepping stone to obtaining a career, and thus avoid the hardships and trials of the revolutionary struggle against the capitalist system, will never include our comrades.

    In 1919, our Party fought against and exposed the unfair Treaty of Versailles.

    In 1921, our Party opposed the capitalists' wage-cutting campaign.

    In 1921-22, when reformist leaders surrendered to the capitalists' demands for wage reductions, longer working hours, and cruel treatment of the unemployed, our Party launched a struggle to "stop the retreat."

    When the miners were betrayed by the leaders of the Triple Alliance (Note 1) in 1921, our Party fully supported the miners' long and arduous struggle. Hundreds of our Party members were arrested and imprisoned in the struggle to defend the miners.

    Our Party helped make every hunger march of the unemployed in London a success. When all other parties in the labor movement abandoned those unemployed, our Party did its best for these unemployed people. This will be a glorious page in the history of our Party.

    Our Party has relentlessly exposed the false and harmful theories spread by those right-wing social democrats who believe that Britain can enter a socialist society without class struggle or attacking the capitalist system—a special "British road" to socialism.

    In 1925, when coal mine owners and Conservatives were preparing to launch the fiercest offensive against the miners, the Conservative government fabricated excuses to imprison twelve of our Party's main leaders and eliminate their obstruction.

    The result of these offensives led to the general strike in May 1926, in which our Party excellently fulfilled its due responsibilities. During those long nine months when the miners were isolated, our Party was their vanguard defender.

    We also remember when we walked out of prison in September 1926, as a representative of the boiler workers, to participate in the Labor Party conference held in Margate that October. At that conference, we challenged the speech of the conference chairman, Bob Williams (whose speech attacked the miners for holding on for too long). At the time, we thought those representatives would not survive because of this action.

    Our Party has given assistance to any appeal from the colonial people. We can say that we have done more than any party in the labor movement in explaining and exposing the essence of imperialism and elucidating why the British people and the colonial people should share weal and woe.

    When workers read the history of labor, they will never forget our Party's struggle to defend the Spanish Republic in 1936-38.

    Hundreds of our Party members sacrificed heroically on the battlefields of the Spanish Republic. If these young and glorious Communist Party members were still alive, we don't know how significant achievements they would create for the British working class.

    Our Party's uninterrupted struggle against fascism certainly did not begin in 1939.

    We launched a fierce offensive against the pro-fascist policies of the Chamberlain government and warned it more than once what such policies would drag the British people into. We have also fought tenaciously for the establishment of friendly relations with the Soviet Union and the establishment of a peaceful alliance with this great socialist country.

    When the shameful Munich Agreement to sell out Czechoslovakia was signed, our Party's Member of Parliament, Gallacher, who enjoyed the permanent trust of the people, stood up and firmly opposed it.

    When Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons that he was going to visit Hitler, Attlee, Maxton, and others all wished him "bon voyage," but only Gallacher condemned it, and he even predicted the betrayal that would follow that visit.

    We are proud of our Party's consistent anti-fascist struggle, whether the struggle was in factories, in the air, at sea, or on the battlefield.

    In 1944, our Party put forward a policy on how to win peace. If this policy had been adopted, the situation would be greatly different from today.

    In 1945, the Labor Party leaders could do whatever they wanted, as they had the support of the entire working class. But they did not see this powerful force, but only the rich men of the City of London and Wall Street.

    They quickly revised their beautiful "socialist" rhetoric in order to implement the orders of monopolistic capitalism and imperialism.

    This explains why they accepted the Marshall Plan, the North Atlantic Treaty, and the Brussels Military Agreement.

    This explains why they are the butchers who slaughtered the outstanding sons and daughters of Malaya and North Korea.

    At the same time, this also explains why they have devastated the British economy with huge military expenditures. They implemented a "nationalization policy" that only allowed the owners of those nationalized industries to profit even more than they did under private ownership. While allowing the cost of living to continue to rise and allowing capitalists to obtain greater profits—profits greater than at any time in British industrial history—the Labor government froze the wages of the working class.

    Not only that, but they soon became an outpost of the US-organized offensive against the Soviet Union. No one is better at slandering and insulting the Soviet Union than the leaders of the British Labor Party.

    The miners of Nikolia, Africa, and their families know best what Labor Party imperialism and their promised independence mean! In the many years to come, the names of Attlee, Bevin, Shinwell, Strachey, and Griffiths will be rejected by the entire people of Malaya and the Far East.

    If there is one thing that can curse the Labor government even more, it should be the fact that the whole world is seriously worried about a new war.

    If Britain and the Soviet Union had stood together in the past to defend peace, then no country in the world would have dared to launch a new war.

    It is precisely this situation that makes the task of the Communist Party of Great Britain more serious than ever. To struggle to change the current national policy—that is our task.

    Our record of the past thirty years proves that our words themselves are a guarantee.

    Today, struggling for peace and supporting the Stockholm Declaration is one of our most urgent tasks. I am confident that our Party members will respond to this struggle in a manner worthy of our Party's history.

    Our struggle for peace is never for selfish gain. We want peace because we hope that everyone will have a better and happier life.

    We are fighting for peace because we also want to end the death and destruction brought about by capitalism and war, so that we can move towards a better and happier life, and only socialism will bring this better and happier life.

    We never want to see the shocking alarms sound again, children fearfully clutching their mothers' skirts.

    We never want to be afraid of a moonlit night again, afraid of not knowing what will fall from the sky.

    We want to eliminate the terror from people's lives!

    We want to stop Europe from being devastated like the barren lands of Oklahoma (Note 2) to satisfy the desires of the profiteers and warmongers. (Zhao Shuhan excerpted from the July 29th British Worker Daily)

    Note 1: In 1921, the three British trade unions, the Railwaymen's Union, the Transport Union, and the Miners' Union, organized a joint body, generally known as the "Triple Alliance." In the miners' struggle against the coal mine owners, the union bosses of the "Triple Alliance" betrayed the interests of the working class.

    Note 2: Oklahoma is a state in the United States. The big capitalists in the United States bought land in this state at low prices, without building water conservancy projects or applying fertilizer. After a few years, the land was exhausted and became barren. The big capitalists abandoned this piece and went to buy another big piece. As a result, many fields in this state were ruined by them.

　　英国共产党为保卫和平而斗争
    为英国共产党成立三十周年而作
    英国共产党总书记  波立特
    我们的共产党成立于一九二○年七月三十一日，到今年七月三十一日整整三十年了。
    过去三十年中，英国共产党走过了一段漫长而光荣的阶级斗争的道路，英国共产党和一切公开的资本家敌人以及劳工运动中的右派分子作了斗争。在工人阶级反对资本主义制度的斗争中，这些右派分子曾一贯地企图摧毁并混乱工人阶级的阵营。
    在今天，我们共产党的历史已经成为劳工运动史的重要部分，因为在这三十年中间，曾经发生了一系列的事件、斗争与胜利，在这些斗争中，我们党很骄傲地保持了英国工人阶级的最优良的传统。
    我们的党，开始时是弱小的，而且环境不利，但我们已经锻炼成为一个新型的工人阶级的政党，在今天，没有任何力量可以分裂或摧毁他。
    我们党的同志们，过去和今天从没有想到过个人和地位。把劳工运动看成为获得职业的垫脚石，因之就可以摆脱反对资本主义制度的革命斗争的艰苦和磨炼的人们中，决不会有我们的同志的。
    一九一九年我们党曾为反对并揭露不公平的凡尔赛和约而斗争过。
    一九二一年，我们党曾反对过资本家的削减工资运动。
    一九二一——二二年改良主义派的领袖们向资本家的减低工资、加长工时和残酷对付失业者的要求投降的时候，我们党曾为“停止后退”而展开了斗争。
    当一九二一年矿工们被三角联盟（注一）的领袖们出卖了以后，我们党曾全力地支持了矿工们的长期而坚苦的斗争。在保卫矿工的斗争中，我们党数以百计的党员曾被捕入狱。
    我们党曾协助伦敦每次失业者的饥饿游行获得成功，当所有其他劳工运动中的党派都背弃了那些失业者们的时候，我们党曾为这些失业的人们尽了力量，这将成为我们党史中光辉的一页。
    我们党曾经无情地揭露了那些右翼社会民主主义派所散布的虚伪而有害的理论，他们认为英国不通过阶级斗争或打击资本主义制度就可以进入社会主义社会——特殊的通向社会主义的“英国道路”。
    一九二五年，当煤矿主和保守党分子正在准备向矿工们发动最凶猛的进攻的时候，保守党政府曾捏造借口，把我们党的十二位主要领袖关入了监狱，消灭他们的阻挠。
    这些攻势的结果就引起了一九二六年五月的总罢工，在这次罢工中，我们党出色地尽了它所应尽的职责，在矿工们陷于孤立的那漫长的九个月当中，我们党又是他们最前锋的保卫者。
    我们还记得一九二六年九月我们走出了监狱，以锅炉工人代表资格参加了当年十月在马哥特所举行的工党会议。在那次大会上，我们曾向大会主席鲍波·威廉的演说提出了挑战（他的演说攻击矿工们坚持得太久），当时我们以为由于这种行动那些代表是不会活命的。
    我们党对任何殖民地人民的呼吁，都给予了援助。我们可以说，在解释和暴露帝国主义的本质、阐明为什么英国人民和殖民地人民要休戚与共这些方面，我们比劳工运动中的任何党派都做得更多。
    当工人们阅读劳工史的时候，他们决不会忘记我们党在一九三六——三八年为保卫西班牙共和国而作的斗争。
  我们成百的党员在西班牙共和国的战场上壮烈的牺牲了，假如这些年青而光荣的共产党员还活着的话，我们不知道他们将为英国工人阶级创造出多么重大的成就来。
    我们党反对法西斯主义的不间断的斗争决不是始于一九三九年。
    我们曾对张伯伦政府的亲法西斯政策发动了激烈的攻势，并且不止一次地警告它这种政策将把英国人民拖入什么地步。我们也曾为与苏联建立友好关系、与这个伟大的社会主义国家建立和平同盟而坚韧地斗争过。
    当可耻的出卖捷克的慕尼黑协定签订的时候，享有人民永久信任的我们党国会议员葛拉彻曾挺身而出坚决反对。
    当张伯伦在下院宣布他要访问希特勒的时候，艾德礼、麦克斯敦等都祝福他“一路平安”，独有葛拉彻予以谴责，他更预言了紧跟着那次访问而发生的出卖行为。
    我们对我党的自始至终反法西斯的斗争感到骄傲，不管斗争是在工厂中也好，空中，海上或战场上也好。
  在一九四四年，我们党曾提出一项如何争取和平的政策，假如这个政策被采纳的话，情况将与今日大大的不同。
    一九四五年的时候，工党领袖们可以为所欲为，那时有整个的工人阶级在支持他们。但他们没看见这支强大的力量，而只看到了伦敦城与华尔街的富翁们。
    他们很快地修正了他们的漂亮“社会主义”的言辞，以便实行独占的资本主义与帝国主义的命令。
    这就说明了为什么他们会接受马歇尔计划、北大西洋公约以及布鲁塞尔军事协定。
    这就说明了为什么他们是屠杀马来亚与北朝鲜优秀儿女的屠夫。
    同时，这也说明了为什么他们以庞大的军事耗费摧残了英国的经济。他们执行了一种“国有化政策”，这种政策只有使那些国有化的工业的主人们比在私营的情况下还要获利。在允许生活费用不断高涨，允许资本家获得更大的利润——这种利润比英国工业史上任何时候都要大——的同时，工党政府冻结了工人阶级的工资。
    不仅如此，他们不久又变成了美国所组织的对苏联进攻的前哨，没有人再比英国工党领袖们更善于毁谤与侮蔑苏联了。
    非洲尼可利亚的矿工和他们的家属们最懂得工党帝国主义和他们允诺的独立意味着什么！在未来的许多年代中，艾德礼、贝文、辛威尔、斯特拉彻和格利福斯的名字将为整个的马来亚与远东人民所唾弃。
    假如还有一件事情能够更诅咒工党政府的话，那么这应该是这一事实了，即全世界都为一个新的战争而严重地感到不安。
    假如在过去英国和苏联站在一起共同保卫和平的话，那么，世界上就不会再有任何国家敢于发动新的战争。
    正是这种情况才使得英国共产党的任务比有史以来任何时候都更加严重。为改变目前的国家政策而斗争——这就是我们的任务。
    我们三十年来的记录就证明了：我们的言语的本身就是保证。
    今天，为争取和平与支持斯德哥尔摩宣言的纲领而斗争是我们许多任务中最迫切的一个。我有信心，我们党的党员将会以一种无愧于我们党的历史的方式来响应这一斗争。
    我们争取和平的斗争决不是为了私利，我们要和平是因为我们希望所有的人都会得到一个更美满而幸福的生活。
  我们为争取和平而战，因为我们也要终止资本主义与战争所带来的死亡和毁灭，以便使我们有可能向美满而幸福的生活迈进，而只有社会主义才会带来这种美满而幸福的生活。
    我们永远再也不愿意看到使人震悚的警报鸣放的时候，儿童们恐惧地抓紧母亲的衣裙。
    我们永远再也不愿意对一个月夜感到恐惧，害怕不知道会从天上掉下什么东西来。
    我们要消除人民生活中的恐怖！
    我们要阻止为满足利欲薰心者与战争贩子们的欲望而使欧洲受到像奥克拉荷马的荒瘠的土地（注二）似的摧残。（赵书汉节译七月二十九日英国工人日报）
    注一：一九二一年时英国的三个工会，铁路工会、交通工会和矿工工会组织了一个联合机构，一般称之为“三角联盟”。在矿工展开反煤矿主的斗争中，“三角联盟”的工会头子们曾出卖工人阶级的利益。
    注二：奥克拉荷马，是美国一州。美国的大资本家们在这一州内以贱价收购田地，既不修水利，也不施肥料，几年后，田力用尽，即成荒地。大资本家即抛弃这一块，再去买另一大块。结果，这一州内许多田地都被他们糟蹋了。
