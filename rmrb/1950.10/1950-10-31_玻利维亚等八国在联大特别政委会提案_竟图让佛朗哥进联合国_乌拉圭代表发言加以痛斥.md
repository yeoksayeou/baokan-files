Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 28th: At the meeting of the UN Special Political Committee on the morning of October 27th, a new attempt emerged to overturn the General Assembly's resolution of December 12, 1946, which prohibited the Spanish Franco fascist regime from participating in UN organizations. This attempt was initiated by a group of Latin American country delegations. The aforementioned resolution also stipulated that member states should withdraw their ambassadors and ministers from Spain. This attempt to force the United Nations to recognize the Franco fascist regime came in the form of a new proposal submitted by Bolivia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, the Philippines, and Peru, requesting the cancellation of the UN General Assembly resolution of December 12, 1946.

　　This proposal was presented by the Dominican Republic representative, Ordonez, who also delivered a provocative speech, arguing that Spain's participation in UN organizations could strengthen the forces for maintaining peace.

　　Representatives from Peru, El Salvador, Bolivia, and other countries – the proposers of this proposal – immediately came forward to support this argument. Polish representative, Polanski, declared that his delegation would study the new proposal and therefore suggested postponing the work of the Special Political Committee until the morning of October 30th. Representatives from Australia, Argentina, and Bolivia objected. The Polish representative's proposal was subsequently rejected by a vote of 34 to 6, with 6 abstentions.

　　The United Nations General Assembly Special Political Committee continued its discussion on October 28th regarding the proposal to open the doors of the United Nations to Franco's Spain.

　　The first to speak was Uruguayan representative Fabregat, who passionately appealed to the Special Political Committee not to repeal the 1946 resolution regarding the withdrawal of ambassadors and ministers from Madrid and the prohibition of Spain from participating in the United Nations. Fabregat declared: The Franco regime was forcibly imposed on the Spanish people with the help of Hitler's gang and Italian fascists. Maintaining the resolution made in 1946 remains a necessary obligation.

　　Fabregat pointed out: Repealing the 1946 resolution is unacceptable because Spaniards under Franco's rule are still being persecuted and arrested for their belief in the Republic, and the actual situation in Franco's Spain has not changed in any way. Fabregat asked: Should the suggestion to change the attitude towards Franco be explained by a change in the principles of the United Nations?

　　Fabregat exposed the hypocrisy of the claim that the 1946 resolution violated the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of nations as stipulated in the Charter. After recalling that the real interferers had confessed, Fabregat mentioned Mussolini's boast that "from our first bullet to the last, we have used them to interfere in Spain," and Hitler's statement that "the Axis has become a triangle consisting of Germany, Italy, and Spain."

　　Fabregat said that this deplorable interference, which caused a worldwide war and created generations of orphans, is a historical fact. If the United Nations General Assembly disregards history, it will bear all the blame.

　　Fabregat recalled that the United States had requested in 1946 that Spain be prohibited from participating in the specialized agencies of the United Nations until the Franco government was replaced by an acceptable regime.

　　Fabregat concluded by saying that Uruguay supported this attitude in the past and continues to support it now, so it will vote against the proposal that would open the door to Franco "and roll out the red carpet to welcome Franco."

　　The next speaker was the Canadian representative, who supported the proposal, using the excuse that the passage of this proposal did not have political implications, so it did not represent "open approval or tacit consent of the Franco regime."

　　Following him were the representatives of Liberia, Cooper, and the Union of South Africa, who also supported the proposal. The last to speak was the British representative, Shasques, who declared: The British government believes that nothing has happened in the past that requires a change in the attitude towards Franco, nor has anything happened that can serve as a basis for changing this attitude. He said that therefore, the British delegation will abstain from voting on the proposal as it did when voting on the same proposal last year.

　　The committee then adjourned and will reconvene on October 30th.

　　玻利维亚等八国在联大特别政委会提案
    竟图让佛朗哥进联合国  乌拉圭代表发言加以痛斥
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：塔斯社纽约二十八日电：联大特别政治委员会于十月二十七日上午开会时，会场上出现新的企图，想取消一九四六年十二月十二日大会关于禁止西班牙佛朗哥法西斯政权参加联合国各机构的决议。这个企图是拉丁美洲国家代表团的一个集团所发动的。按上述决议还曾规定各会员国应撤回其驻西班牙的大使与公使。这个想要迫使联合国认可佛朗哥法西斯政权的企图，是以新的提案的方式出现的，该提案系由玻利维亚、哥斯达黎加、多米尼加、萨尔瓦多、洪都拉斯、尼加拉瓜、菲律宾与秘鲁提出，要求取消一九四六年十二月十二日联大的决议。
    这个提案由多米尼加代表俄多内兹提出，他还发表了煽动性的演说，硬说西班牙参加联合国各机构可以加强维护和平的势力。
    秘鲁、萨尔瓦多、玻利维亚、与其他国家——这一提案的提案国——的代表们立即出而支持这个论调。波兰代表波拉恩斯基宣称，他的代表团要研究新提案，因此建议将特别政治委员会的工作延至十月三十日上午进行。澳大利亚、阿根廷、与玻利维亚代表提出反对。波兰代表的提议遂以三十四票对六票以及六票弃权而遭否决。
    联合国大会特别政治委员会于十月二十八日继续讨论企图使联合国打开大门让佛朗哥西班牙进来的提案。
    第一个发言的是乌拉圭代表法百莱格，他热切地向特别政治委员会呼吁，不要废止一九四六年关于自马德里撤退大使和公使以及禁止西班牙参加联合国的决议。法百莱格声称：佛朗哥政权是在希特勒匪帮和意大利法西斯分子的帮助之下以武力强制加在西班牙人民身上的，维持一九四六年所作的决议。目前仍然是必须履行的义务。
    法百莱格指出：废止一九四六年的决议是不能容许的，因为佛朗哥统治下的西班牙人仍然是因他们信仰共和国而遭受迫害与逮捕，而且佛朗哥西班牙的实际情况并没有任何改变。法百莱格问道：改变对佛朗哥的态度的建议是否必须以联合国原则有了改变来解释。
    法百莱格揭穿了所谓一九四六年的决议违反了宪章中禁止干涉国家内政的规定这种说法的伪善性。法百莱格在追述真正的干涉者已作出自供之后，提到墨索里尼曾吹嘘说“从我们的第一颗子弹到最后一颗都用来干预西班牙”，以及希特勒所说“轴心国已经成了包括德国、意大利和西班牙三个鼎足而立的三角”。
    法百莱格说，这种引起了全世界战争并制造整代孤儿的可悲的干涉，是历史的事实。如果联合国大会不顾历史，就将负一切咎责。
    法百莱格追述说，美国曾在一九四六年要求在佛朗哥政府还没有为可接受的政权所替代以前禁止西班牙参加联合国的专门机关。
    法百莱格最后说，乌拉圭过去支持现在仍然支持这种态度，所以将投票反对那个建议对佛朗哥大开方便之门“并铺下红毯迎接佛朗哥”的提案。
    下一个发言的是加拿大代表，他支持提案，借口说这个提案的通过并没有政治的含意，所以这并不表示“对佛朗哥政权的公开的赞同或默许”。
    继起发言的是利比里亚代表柯伯和南非联邦代表，他们也支持提案。最后发言的是英国代表沙士克斯，他声称：英政府认为：过去并没有发生任何使对佛朗哥的态度需要有所改变的事情，也没有发生任何能作为改变这种态度的根据的事情。他说，所以英国代表团在表决提案时将和它在去年表决同样的建议时一样弃权。
    委员会随后宣告休会，至十月三十日再开。
