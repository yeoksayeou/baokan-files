　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, 23rd: (TASS) - The United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee has been discussing the issue of the former Italian colony of Libya continuously since October 9th. The main part of the discussion concluded on the 19th.

　　After listening to the report of the United Nations Commissioner for Libya, Mr. Pelt, and the reports of the British and French authorities currently administering Libya, the committee held a general debate on the Libyan issue.

　　In his various speeches, Soviet representative Mr. Arutiunian pointed out that the British and French administrative authorities in Libya, under the behind-the-scenes instigation of the United States and with the active cooperation of the United Nations Commissioner for Libya, are implementing a policy of dividing Libya and attempting to transform Libya into a war base for US-UK imperialism. These actions are in violation of the United Nations General Assembly resolution passed in 1949 to establish an independent and unified Libya. Therefore, the Soviet delegation proposed that an independent and unified Libyan state be established immediately, that foreign troops withdraw from Libya within three months, and that foreign military bases in Libya be abolished.

　　Representatives from Poland, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, and Byelorussia supported the Soviet proposal.

　　Representatives from Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Egypt, and other countries also criticized Britain and France in their speeches for violating the United Nations General Assembly resolution and encouraging separatist movements in Libya.

　　Thirteen countries, including Arab nations, India, and Greece, jointly submitted a proposal that included setting a deadline of January 1, 1951, for the establishment of a Libyan National Assembly and April 1, 1951, for the establishment of a Libyan interim government.

　　Byelorussian representative Mr. Astapenko pointed out that the joint proposal of the thirteen countries did not stipulate the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in Libya, which is a prerequisite for guaranteeing Libya's independence. The representative of Saudi Arabia, one of the proponents of the thirteen-country proposal, also criticized the thirteen-country proposal for not stipulating the withdrawal of foreign troops from Libya. Representatives from Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon, three other proponents of the thirteen-country proposal, stated that they would vote in favor of the entire Soviet proposal when it was put to a vote.

　　The committee voted on the Soviet proposal and the thirteen-country proposal on the 19th. Although the Soviet proposal was ultimately rejected by 38 votes manipulated by the US and Britain, 13 countries still supported the proposal, and 7 countries abstained. The thirteen-country proposal was subsequently passed by a majority of 53 votes, with France voting against it and the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia abstaining.

　　联大特别政委会讨论利比亚问题
    苏联揭露美英阴谋
    要求撤退外国驻军建立独立统一的利比亚
   【新华社二十三日讯】综合塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会特别政治委员会自十月九日起连续讨论前意大利殖民地利比亚问题。讨论的主要部分已于十九日结束。
   委员会在听取了联合国驻利比亚专员皮尔特的报告和目前管理利比亚的英国及法国当局的报告后，即就利比亚问题举行一般辩论。
   苏联代表亚鲁疆在历次发言中指出：利比亚的英国和法国管理当局，在美国的幕后指使及联合国驻利比亚专员的积极合作下，正在实行一种分裂利比亚的政策，并企图变利比亚为美英帝国主义的战争基地。而这些行动都是违反联合国大会一九四九年所通过的建立独立统一的利比亚的决议的。苏联代表团因此提出提案，规定立即建立独立统一的利比亚国家，外国军队于三个月内撤出利比亚，并取消在利比亚的外国军事基地。
   波兰、乌克兰、捷克斯洛伐克、白俄罗斯代表支持苏联的提案。
   叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯、伊拉克、埃及等国代表在发言中也指责英、法两国违反联合国大会决议，在利比亚鼓励分裂运动。
   阿拉伯国家、印度、希腊等十三个国家联合提出一个提案，包括限期在一九五一年一月一日以前成立利比亚国民议会，一九五一年四月一日以前成立利比亚临时政府两点。
   白俄罗斯代表阿斯塔平科指出十三国联合提案未规定撤退驻在利比亚的外国军队，而这是保证利比亚独立的先决条件。十三国提案的提案国沙特阿拉伯的代表也批评该十三国提案未规定外国军队自利比亚撤退。十三国提案的另外三个提案国叙利亚、伊拉克及黎巴嫩的代表，表示将在表决苏联整个提案时，投票赞成。
   委员会于十九日表决苏联提案及十三国提案。苏联提案最后虽被美英操纵之三十八票反对所否决，但仍有十三国支持该提案，七国弃权。十三国提案继以五十三票多数通过，法国投票反对，苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克弃权。
