Xinhua News Agency, 2nd Dispatch: A comprehensive TASS dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly concluded its general debate and elected replacement countries for outgoing members of various UN agencies. The plenary session on September 28 continued the general debate. At the morning session, the Egyptian representative mentioned in his speech that Egypt abstained from voting on the Security Council resolution on the Korean issue on June 27, explaining that this was due to concerns that this resolution would cause a prolonged war.
	The head of the Ukrainian delegation, Baranovsky, spoke last, supporting the Soviet Union's proposal to "stop the threat of a new war and consolidate peace and security." He condemned the United States and Britain for trying to solve international problems by force, and pointed out that the actual purpose of the proposals put forward by the US representative at the General Assembly was to weaken the power of the Security Council, which bears the main responsibility for maintaining peace and security. The Ukrainian representative went on to accuse the representatives of some national governments, including the Tito government, of arbitrarily spreading rumors and slandering the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, and exposed that the representative of the Tito government appeared at this General Assembly as a participant in the imperialist anti-Soviet conspiracy.
	At the afternoon session, after the representative of Abyssinia spoke, UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie concluded the general debate with a brief statement. The General Assembly then approved the Security Council's decision of September 26 to accept the Republic of Indonesia as a member of the United Nations.
	On September 29, the General Assembly plenary session held elections for replacement council members of various agencies. At the morning session, Brazil and the Netherlands were elected to replace Cuba and Norway, the non-permanent members of the Security Council whose terms expire at the end of this year. After eight ballots for Lebanon and Turkey, the candidates to replace Egypt, another non-permanent member, neither received the required majority.
	At the afternoon session, six replacement countries for the expiring members of the Economic and Social Council were elected. The Soviet Union, Poland, and the United Kingdom were re-elected, and Uruguay, the Philippines, and Switzerland replaced Brazil, Australia, and Denmark. The General Assembly also elected Thailand to replace the Philippines, a member of the Trusteeship Council whose term is expiring; Dominica, another expiring member, was re-elected.
	At the afternoon session, four more secret ballots were held successively for the remaining unresolved Security Council member, but still without result. The General Assembly then decided to postpone the election of members of the Security Council and adjourned the meeting. The Political Committee and the Special Political Committee began work on September 30.

　　联大结束一般辩论
    选出巴西、荷兰接替古巴、挪威任安理会理事，黎巴嫩与土耳其竞选激烈
    【新华社二日讯】综合塔斯社消息：联合国大会结束一般辩论，并选出联合国各机构的任满理事国的替补国。九月二十八日全体会议继续一般辩论。在上午会议上，埃及代表发言中提到埃及在安理会六月二十七日表决关于朝鲜问题的决议案时弃权，解释说这是因为担心这个决心会引起长期战争。
    乌克兰代表团团长巴拉诺夫斯基最后发言支持苏联的“制止新战争威胁，巩固和平与安全”的建议。他谴责美国和英国力图用武力解决国际问题，并指出美国代表在大会上所提出的建议的实际目的是削弱担负维持和平与安全之主要责任的安理会的权力。乌克兰代表继指责一些国家政府包括铁托政府的代表恣意造谣、诽谤苏联及人民民主国家，并揭破铁托政府的代表是以帝国主义反苏阴谋的参加者的面貌在本届大会出现的。
    下午会议上，在阿比西尼亚代表发言后，联合国秘书长赖伊以简短声明结束了一般辩论。大会随即批准安理会九月二十六日关于接受印尼共和国为联合国会员的决定。
    九月二十九日大会全体会议举行各机构替补理事的选举。上午会议选出巴西及荷兰接替安理会今年年底任满的非常任理事古巴和挪威。接替另一非常任理事埃及的候选国黎巴嫩及土耳其，经八次投票，无一获得所需之多数。
    下午会议选举了经社理事会六个即将任满理事的替补国家。苏联、波兰及英国获得连任，乌拉圭、菲律宾及瑞士代替了巴西、澳大利亚及丹麦。大会又选出泰国代替托管理事会即将任满的理事国菲律宾；另一将任满的理事国多米尼加连任。
    下午会议先后就剩下的一个未决安理会理事又举行了四次秘密投票，仍无结果。大会乃决定安理会理事国的选举延期举行，并宣告休会。政治委员会和特别政治委员会于九月三十日开始工作。
