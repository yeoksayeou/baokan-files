　　Great Achievements of State-Owned Trade in the Past Year

　　Over the past year, state-owned trade has established a vast commercial network, achieving great success in promoting the exchange of goods, supporting production, and ensuring people's livelihoods.

　　Coordinating to Stabilize Prices, Vigorously Purchasing Native Products

　　Over the past year, state-owned trade, in coordination with other national financial and economic endeavors, especially after the national fiscal balance was achieved in March, has worked hard to achieve basic stability in national prices. According to statistics, the national major commodity wholesale price index from April to August was 75.2, 92.5, 99.6, 107.3, and 103.4, respectively. The monthly fluctuation range after May was within 10 percent. Compared with the price fluctuations before the end of last year and the large fluctuations from January to March this year, this is clearly a complete change. In order to stabilize prices, state-owned trade, in coordination with the financial departments, transferred 6 billion jin of grain nationwide from January to July this year, ensuring the grain supply in major cities, special product areas, and disaster areas, and economically striking a heavy blow to market speculators, so that national grain prices have been basically stable since April. The phenomenon that grain prices inevitably soared during the lean season no longer exists. In addition, state-owned trade has regularly supplied a large number of daily necessities to various places throughout the year, stabilizing prices.

　　Over the past year, state-owned trade has systematically carried out the purchase of agricultural, local, and special products. According to incomplete statistics, in the nine months from January to September this year, state-owned trading companies purchased large quantities of grain, cotton, tea, tung oil, pig bristles, fresh eggs, silk cocoons, and edible vegetable oil. The purchase volume of cotton alone reached about 30 percent of the national cotton production in 1949. As agricultural products found sales channels and farmers' purchasing power increased relatively, market transactions became very active. According to incomplete statistics, from January to September this year, state-owned trading companies sold hundreds of millions of yuan worth of cotton cloth, coal, kerosene, and salt in various markets; the sales volume of cotton cloth accounted for 19.42 percent of the total national production in the nine months. A large part of these goods were bought by farmers in various places; while other parts, such as eggs, pig bristles, tea, silk cocoons, and furs, were exported in large quantities, exchanging for some of the materials needed for national economic construction.

　　Processing and Purchasing to Support Industrial Production, Establishing Trade Networks Throughout Various Regions

　　Over the past year, state-owned trade has also played a significant role in supporting industrial production. From January to September this year alone, state-owned trade spent 3,916,182 dan of cotton for processing for public and private textile industries, and purchased more than 75 percent of the total national cotton cloth production in the nine months; in addition, there were a large number of cotton yarns, daily necessities, machinery, and various building materials, helping private industrial and commercial enterprises solve the difficulties of temporary sluggish sales after price stabilization and maintaining production. Taking the textile industry as an example, after a year of strong support from state-owned trade, plus the arrival of the peak season, most of the 4.2 million spindles (of which private enterprises account for more than 45 percent) have begun to resume operating for an average of six days and six nights a week since September, which is a great improvement compared to the situation in the second half of last year when only 3 million spindles were operating nationwide, and operating for less than five days and five nights a week.

　　The main reasons for the above-mentioned achievements of state-owned trade over the past year are that, under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government, it has realized the policy of stabilizing prices, supporting production, and ensuring people's livelihoods, basically correctly implemented the national commercial work's policy of overall consideration for both public and private sectors and developing production, and has begun to implement planned leadership and management. The universal development of state-owned commercial networks over the past year has guaranteed the realization of the above-mentioned tasks and policies. According to incomplete statistics, so far, state-owned trade has established 15 specialized companies, and the operating units of state-owned commerce in various places have reached more than 4,200, with a total staff of more than 120,000, including newly established institutions in ethnic minority areas in Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Xikang provinces. This trade network, widely distributed across the mainland, is currently continuing to be consolidated and expanded, and will further play a greater role in enlivening urban and rural areas, domestic and foreign exchanges, and supporting production.

### 一年来国营贸易的巨大成就

　　一年来国营贸易的巨大成就
    国营贸易一年来组成广大的商业网，在促进物资交流，扶助生产，保障人民生活等方面都获得巨大成就。
    配合稳定物价  大力收购土产
    一年来国营贸易配合其他的国家财经工作，特别是在三月以后国家财政收支趋于平衡的基础上，曾努力使全国物价达到基本稳定。据统计：今年四月至八月全国主要商品批发价环比总指数依次为七五·二，九二·五，九九·六，一○七·三，一○三·四，五月份以后逐月升降幅度都在百分之十以内。这与去年年底以前的几次物价波动以及今年一月至三月波动幅度很大的情况比较起来，显然已经全然改观。国营贸易为了稳定物价，在财政部门的配合下，自今年一月至七月在全国范围内调运粮食六十亿斤，保证了全国各大城市、特产区和灾区的粮食供应，并从经济上予市场投机分子以严重打击，使得四月份以来全国粮价即基本上趋于稳定，过去青黄不接季节粮价一定飞涨的现象已不再存在。加上一年来国营贸易又经常以大量生活日用必需品供应各地，使物价趋于稳定。
    国营贸易一年来曾有计划地开展农产、土产、特产品的收购工作，据不完全统计，自今年一月至九月的九个月内，国营贸易公司收购了大量的粮食、棉花、茶叶、桐油、猪鬃、鲜蛋、丝茧和食用植物油等，其中棉花一项的收购量即达一九四九年度全国棉产量的百分之三十左右。由于农产品找到了销路，农民的购买力相对提高，因而市场交易大为活跃。据不完全统计：统计今年一至九月国营贸易公司在各地市场销售了价值以亿万元计的棉布、煤炭、煤油、食盐等；其中棉布的销售量即占九个月内全国总产量的百分之十九点四二。这些货物中有很大一部分为各地农民买去；而另一部分如蛋品、猪鬃、茶叶、丝茧、皮毛等则大量出口，换回了国家经济建设所需的部分物资。
    加工收购扶助工业生产  各地区普遍设立贸易网
    国营贸易一年来在扶助工业生产上也起了很大作用。国营贸易仅今年一至九月间对公、私营纺织业加工支出的棉花即达三百九十一万六千一百八十二担，收购棉布占九个月内全国棉布总产量的百分之七十五以上；此外还有大批的棉纱、日常生活必需品、机器和各种建筑器材等，帮助私营工商业解决了物价稳定后暂时滞销的困难，维持了生产。以纺织业为例，经过国营贸易一年来的大力扶助，加上旺月已届，四百二十万纺锭（其中属于私营的占百分之四十五强）中的大部分从九月份起业已开始恢复到平均每周开工六日六夜，较之去年下半年全国运转纺锭仅三百万枚，每周开工尚不及五日五夜的情况，已大有改善。
    国营贸易一年来获致上述成就的主要原因，是由于在中央人民政府统一领导下，实现了稳定物价，扶助生产和保障民生的方针，基本上正确执行了国家商业工作中公私统筹兼顾、发展生产的政策，并开始实行计划化的领导和经营管理。而一年来国营商业网的普遍发展则保证了上述任务和政策的实现。据不完全统计，至目前为止，国营贸易已经建立了十五个专业公司，各地国营商业的经营单位达四千二百多处，全部工作人员在十二万人以上，其中包括有新疆、青海、西康各省少数民族地区新近所建立的机构在内。这个广布大陆的贸易网，目前还在继续巩固和扩大中，将更进一步在活跃城乡、内外交流、扶助生产上起更大的作用。【新华社】
