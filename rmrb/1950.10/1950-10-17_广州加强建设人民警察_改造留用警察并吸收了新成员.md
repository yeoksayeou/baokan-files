　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th: Guangzhou has achieved preliminary success in building the People's Police. After the liberation of Guangzhou, the city's public security authorities, on the one hand, promptly provided ideological and political education to the old police officers they received, and appropriately disposed of them according to their wishes, either by retaining them, providing them with training, transferring them to other jobs, or sending them back to their hometowns. On the other hand, they successively absorbed a group of workers, shop assistants, students, and revolutionary intellectuals through government organs, organizations, etc., strengthening the new blood in the People's Police. In August of this year, the city established a Public Security School to train grassroots public security cadres and People's Police. The school also has a People's Police training class, regularly maintaining a rotating training of 240 on-duty police officers. In peacetime, the city's police are divided into categories such as traffic, household registration, public security, health, and fire protection, and are gathered once or twice a week for professional education.

　　After several months of education and transformation, most of the retained police officers have initially established the concept of serving the people, and have a general understanding of the policies and decrees of the People's Government. At the same time, through collective education methods such as grievance meetings and self-examination meetings, they have criticized the past criminal behavior of riding on the heads of the people and acting like overlords, as well as their mercenary viewpoints. Therefore, many retained police officers have shown positive and good performance in their work positions. For example, police officer Li Jinbei was injured while capturing bandits but still endured the pain to pursue them, finally capturing the bandits, seizing guns, and recovering stolen goods. Traffic police officer Li Sheng found more than 3 million yuan in Renminbi next to his duty station, and immediately handed it over to the public in its entirety for claiming.

　　广州加强建设人民警察
    改造留用警察并吸收了新成员
    【新华社广州十六日电】广州市在建设人民警察工作上，获得了初步成绩。广州解放后，该市公安当局一方面对接收的旧警察及时进行思想和政治教育，并按照其志愿，适当地分别予以留用、学习、转业或遣送回乡等处置；另一方面则先后经过机关、团体等吸收了一批工人、店员、学生和革命知识分子，增强了人民警察中的新血液。今年八月，该市成立了公安学校，进行训练公安基层干部和人民警察的工作。校内并设有人民警察训练班，经常保持轮训二百四十名在职警察。平时则按交通、户籍、治安、卫生、消防等类别，每星期将全市警察分别集中一、二次，进行业务教育。
    经过几个月来的教育改造，留用警察大都初步建立了为人民服务的观点，对人民政府的政策、法令也有了一般的认识和了解。同时，通过诉苦会、反省会等集体教育的方式，对过去骑在人民头上作威作福的罪恶行为和雇佣观点作了批判。因此，许多留用警察在工作岗位上都有积极的、良好的表现。如警士李锦备在捕匪时负了伤仍忍痛追匪，终于将匪捕获，缴到枪枝，追回了赃物。交通警察利生在岗亭旁拾得人民币三百余万元，立即全数交公招领。
