Comrades Zhuo Shenfu and Zheng Hong's opinions on my book "History of the Revolutionary War of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" and "Outline of Social Development History" are both very valuable. Most of these opinions can be used as the basis and reference for revisions. Some other opinions should be discussed in detail, but because I am currently ill, I cannot write much, so I can only briefly reply as follows:

Concerning the "History of the Revolutionary War of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom"

    Comrade Zhuo Shenfu's evaluation of this small book is too high, which makes me feel very ashamed. In fact, this book is written very roughly and has many shortcomings. The points Comrade Zhuo Shenfu criticized are all very pertinent. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly explain some of the opinions.

    I. The marching routes of the four Northern Expeditionary forces were mentioned briefly on page 96, namely that Huang Shengcai's detachment passed through Shucheng, Zhengyang, Yingshang, Mengcheng, and Yongcheng in Anhui, crossed the river at Tianfenggong, and arrived at Jinxiang, Shandong; Chen Shibao's and Xu Zongyang's detachments and Huang Yiyun's detachment joined Huang Shengcai's detachment at the junction of Jiangsu and Shandong, and their marching route was the same as that of Huang Shengcai's detachment; Zeng Lichang's detachment went north later, and his marching route was not recorded in detail, only saying that he arrived in Jinxiang, Shandong, to meet with Huang Shengcai's detachment, etc. This is indeed too brief, and efforts should be made to supplement it after finding historical materials.

    II. Regarding the marching route of Zeng Tianyang's army in the Western Expedition, it was only mentioned on page 106 that "Zeng Tianyang, etc., occupied Jinkou, Hubei," and on page 109 it was said that he advanced from Yichang to Jingzhou, without describing when he arrived in Yichang, which is indeed a shortcoming. Because I could not find specific historical materials about Zeng Tianyang's army marching from Jinkou to Yichang when drafting the manuscript, I had to leave it for correction later.

    III. The section on Shi Dakai's return to Tianjing to quell the internal strife and his subsequent westward march is too brief, and I plan to collect historical materials to add more details.

    IV. Comrade Zhuo Shenfu criticized me for "not making a comparison of place names between ancient and modern times, so some places are not easy to find in the gazetteer." This is true, because I lacked the necessary gazetteer when writing. However, the two place names, Baojialou and Ducheng, are both quoted from the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Historical Events Log," which is based on evidence, although it is not easy to check clearly in ordinary gazetteers. Moreover, although Baojialou is not easy to check in the gazetteer, it has been stated on page 96 that "Baojialou is downstream of Fenggong," because Baojialou is a small place name, while Fenggong can be found on ordinary maps. If I can collect more historical materials in the future, I will carefully verify them to make it easier for readers to check.

    V. The section on page 107, "Yang Xiuqing summoned Prince Yi Shi Dakai back to Tianjing and appointed Qin Rigang to preside over the military and civil affairs of Anhui," did not base on the view of "Unofficial History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" to determine that it was because Yang Xiuqing was suspicious of Shi Dakai. This is because I could not find other evidence besides the view of "Unofficial History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," so I only narrated the facts. As for the true inside story, it remains to be verified.

Concerning the "Outline of Social Development History"

    This small book was written in 1939 and first published in 1940. Many of the viewpoints and writing styles in it are no longer appropriate in today's view. It was roughly revised in 1946, but because it was still published in the KMT-controlled areas, and many historical materials were not available during the revision, it could not be completely rewritten. The bookstore did not contact me in advance for the reprints in 1949 and 1950. I have now notified the bookstore to stop the reprints and wait for the revised edition to be printed. Now, based on Comrade Zheng Hong's criticisms, I would like to declare a few points as follows:

    I. "Stratum" in the book should be uniformly changed to "class." I am preparing to add to the new revised edition the Chinese Liberation War and the great leadership of the people's leader, Chairman Mao.

    II. "Production method" and "mode of production" can be used interchangeably, but they should be used consistently in the same book to avoid confusion.

    III. There is no generally accepted conclusion regarding the reasons for the extinction of ancient forests. What I said in the "Outline of Social Development History" was a bit too affirmative.

    IV. "Tens of millions of years" on page 61 should be changed to "millions of years," and "Of course, each era is at least 10,000 years or more" on page 65 should be changed to "Each of these eras may be 10,000 years or more."

    V. There is no major error in saying on page 71 that "the barbaric era is equivalent to tribal society." Although tribes occurred in the late period of savagery, the full development of the tribal system was in the barbaric period and permeated the entire barbaric period. Engels said: "The tribal system, in most cases, seems to have originated in the Punalu family." This is referring to the budding of the tribal system. The real development of the tribal system was after the emergence of pairing marriage, and "pairing marriage occurred on the border between savagery and barbarism, mostly in the highest stage of savagery, and only in individual cases in the lowest stage of barbarism." Comrade Zheng Hong quoted these few sentences and concluded: "Tribal society was very common in the highest stage of savagery." He did not know that Engels went on to say below these sentences: "This (referring to pairing marriage) is the family form unique to the barbaric era, just as group marriage is unique to the savage era." It can be seen that the full development of the tribal system was indeed in the barbaric period.

    VI. On page 77, line 11, "also has not invented any bows and arrows" should be changed to "also has not invented any war tools." On page 112, line 11, "late Western Zhou Dynasty" is a mistake for "early Western Zhou Dynasty."

### 华岗同志的答复

专栏：

　　华岗同志的答复
    卓申甫、征鸿两位同志对拙著“太平天国革命战争史”与“社会发展史纲”所提意见，都很宝贵。其中大部分意见，都可作为修正根据和参考。另外有些意见本应详细讨论一下，奈因笔者正在病中，不能多写，只能简略答复如下：
  关于“太平天国革命战争史”部分
    卓申甫同志对于这本小书的评价过高，使笔者觉得很惭愧，其实这本书写得很粗糙，缺点很多，卓申甫同志所批评的几点，都很中肯，其中有几点意见，想趁这个机会简单说明一下。
    一、四支北援军进军路线，在第九十六页上曾经说到一点，即黄生才支队经安徽舒城、正阳、颍上、蒙城、永城，田丰工渡河到达山东金乡；陈世保、许宗扬支队和黄益芸支队在江苏山东交界地方，与黄生才支队会合，进军路线和黄生才支队相同；曾立昌支队北上较迟，没有详细记载他的进军路线，只说他到山东金乡与黄生才支队等会合，确实过于简略，以后找到史料当设法补充。
    二、关于曾天养部西征行军路线，仅在第一○六页说到“曾天养等占领湖北金口”，在第一○九页就说他自宜昌进逼荆州，而没有叙述他何时到达宜昌，确实是一个缺点。因为稿时没有找到曾天养部从金口进军宜昌的具体史料，只得留待以后补正。
    三、关于石达开回天京靖难及以后西行部分，都太简略，拟搜集史料详加补充。
    四、卓申甫同志批评我“在今昔地名上没有作一番比照，因此有些地方在图志上就不易查寻了。”这是确实的，因为在写作时正缺乏必要的图志。惟包家楼与堵城两个地名，都是从“太平天国史事日志”引来，虽然在普通图志上一时不易查考明白，而该日志则确有所据。且包家楼在图志上虽不易查考，但在第九十六页已说明“包家楼在丰工下游”，因包家楼是一个小地名，而丰工则在普通地图上都可查到。以后如能搜集到更多史料，当详加考订，以便读者容易查考。
    五、在第一○七页上所说：“杨秀清召翼王石达开回天京，以秦日纲主持安徽军民各政”一节，没有根据“太平天国野史”的看法，断定是杨秀清猜忌石达开的缘故，这是因为此事除“太平天国野史”这样看法以外，一时还找不到其他证明，所以只叙述其事实，至于真正内幕究竟如何，则尚待考证。
  关于“社会发展史纲”部分
    这本小书写作时间是一九三九年，初版于一九四○年发行，其中有许多观点和写法，在现在看来已经不妥当。在一九四六年曾约略修订几处，但因仍在蒋管区发行，且修订时许多史料都不在手边，所以未能彻底改写。一九四九年及一九五○年重版，书店方面事先均未与笔者联系。现已通知书店，停止重版，俟修订后再印新版。现在根据征鸿同志的批评意见，先声明几点如下：
    一、书中“阶层”应一律改为“阶级”。关于中国解放战争及人民领袖毛主席的伟大领导作用，都准备在修订印行新版时加以增补。
    二、“生产方法”和“生产方式”本可通用，但在同一本书中确应划一使用，以免混淆不清。
    三、关于古代森林消灭的原因，还没有公认的定论，笔者在“社会发展史纲”中所说，是太肯定了一点。
    四、第六十一页“千万年”应改为“百万年”，第六十五页“当然每一个时代，至少是在一万年以上”，应改为“其中每一个时代，可能有一万年以上的”。
    五、第七十一页所说“野蛮时代相当于氏族社会”，并无大谬。因为氏族虽然在蒙昧后期即已发生，但氏族制度的全盛发展，则在野蛮时期，而且贯彻了整个野蛮时期。恩格斯说：“氏族制度，在大多数场合之下，似乎是普那路亚家族中发生的。”这是说的氏族制度的萌芽，真正氏族制度的发展，则在对偶婚产生以后，而“对偶婚发生于蒙昧与野蛮之间的境界上，大半是在蒙昧的最高阶段上，在个别场合之下，只是在野蛮的最低阶段上。”征鸿同志引用这几句话，就断定说：“氏族社会在蒙昧最高阶段就很普遍了”，殊不知道恩格斯在这几句话下面，接着就说道：“这（指对偶婚）是野蛮时代所特有的家族形态，正如群婚之于蒙昧时代。”可见氏族制度的全盛发展，确实是在野蛮时期。
    六、第七十七页第十一行“也还没有发明什么弓矢”，应改为“也还没有发明战争工具”。第一一二页第十一行“西周末期”为“西周初期”之误。
