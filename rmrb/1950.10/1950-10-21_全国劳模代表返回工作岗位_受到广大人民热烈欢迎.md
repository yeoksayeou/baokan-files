The model workers conveyed the proceedings of the meeting and Chairman Mao's instructions, fully exposed the conspiracy of US imperialism to expand its war of aggression, and closely united with the workers to launch a production upsurge.

[Report from this newspaper] After the national model workers' representatives left the capital one after another and returned to their work posts, they were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of people in various places.

The Northeast model workers' representatives returned to Shenyang on the morning of the 8th.栗又文, Secretary-General of the Northeast People's Government, Zhang Weizhen, Chairman of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, Li Lin, Secretary-General of the Political Department of the Northeast Military Region, and other responsible comrades, went to the station to greet them. As soon as the model workers got off the train, they were immediately surrounded by the masses. The masses enthusiastically presented flowers, shook hands, and cheered for the heroes. The representatives of the Central South Region arrived in Hankou on the afternoon of the 9th. The welcoming masses threw flowers at them, and the lively waist drum teams and Yangge teams performed to their hearts' content. When Rong Guansheng returned to Baoding, as soon as she got off the train, the welcoming masses shouted, "Mother is here, welcome our mother!" Wherever she went, the masses welcomed her with this affectionate address. Ma Gensheng, the Shanghai Railway model worker representative, returned to the Shanghai locomotive depot and rushed to shake hands with the workers who surged forward. His hand was blackened by the hands of the workers who were working. The model workers and workers were immersed in a high degree of class friendship.

At the welcome meeting and the special forum held for model workers, the representatives conveyed to the workers the instructions of Chairman Mao and other leaders, as well as the process and feelings of this national model workers' representative meeting. The model workers of Hebei Province returned to Baoding and immediately issued a letter to all workers and peasants in the province, calling on the working people of the province to work together and resolutely and thoroughly guarantee the realization of Chairman Mao's instruction to "build a strong national defense army and a strong economic force." Ma Liuhaier, the industrial model worker representative of Chahar Province, said to the workers who welcomed him: "When I participated in the presidium and shook hands with Chairman Mao, I felt even closer than seeing my own parents. In the past, the reactionaries looked down on us more than anything. Now we have become masters of the country and have received the highest honor given by the government leaders and the people of the whole country. Chairman Mao instructed us to play a leading role, a backbone role, and a bridge role, and I guarantee to do it, unite the workers, do a good job in production, and repay Chairman Mao!" The model workers also introduced the advanced production experience of Ma Hengchang and Zhao Guoyou, and called on the workers to learn from them. Hou Deyuan, the Beijing model worker representative, said: "From this conference, I deeply realized that to do a good job in production, we must rely on the masses."

The representatives fully exposed the conspiracy of US imperialism to expand its war of aggression to the masses in various places. Zhao Guoyou said to the welcoming masses at the Shenyang Railway Station: "US imperialism is directly armed aggression against our country's territory of Taiwan, and has repeatedly used planes to strafe the border of the motherland, killing and wounding our compatriots. We must be highly vigilant and step up our preparations. If any enemy dares to risk invading our country, we will let him go to destruction!" Fang Chenliu, the representative of Lushun-Dalian, said to the masses at the welcome meeting at Dalian Station: "We bring you unwavering confidence from Beijing, that is, the people of the whole country are determined to liberate Taiwan and Tibet. If US imperialism dares to provoke us, we have the strength to defeat it completely!" Lin Shiyao and Meng Yulin, the Northwest industrial model worker representatives, returned to Xi'an and heard that the US invading army had crossed the 38th parallel in Korea and expanded the war of aggression against Korea. They vowed to return to the factory, mobilize all the workers and brothers, accelerate the operation of the machines, work hard in production, and vow to be the rear of supporting the liberation of the national territory and defending the motherland.

The model worker representatives reported in detail to the welcomers about Chairman Mao's recent situation. The Hebei model worker representative recalled the situation when he was with Chairman Mao: "Chairman Mao shook hands with us very vigorously, for at least a minute. When shaking hands, Chairman Mao's eyes stared at you, making people feel extraordinarily kind, giving people lasting memories and eternal glory." Guo Nengcheng, the forest protection model worker of Wutai Mountain, described Chairman Mao to the masses: "Chairman Mao is tall, healthy, and his hands are long and thick. I can't hold them with both hands." Pan Ayao, the Shanghai representative, returned to the factory, and the workers surrounded him, vying to see the photo of Chairman Mao with his autograph. Li Xintang, the Jinan Railway model worker representative, returned home and took out the photos of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu from his body. His wife immediately said, "Hurry up and make a frame and hang it up."

The representatives calmly analyzed this glorious experience and unanimously believed: "The reason why we working people are respected and welcomed is that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the truth that 'labor creates the world' has been restored." Therefore, everyone concluded: Chairman Mao is the source of strength. The Northwest model worker said: When drinking water, don't forget the well-digger, and when we stand up, don't forget Chairman Mao. As long as we follow Chairman Mao, we will always be victorious.

    全国劳模代表返回工作岗位
    受到广大人民热烈欢迎
    劳模们传达了会议经过和毛主席的指示，充分揭露美帝扩大侵略战争的阴谋，和工友紧密团结，掀起生产高潮。
    【本报讯】全国劳模代表先后离开首都，返回工作岗位后，受到各地广大人民的热烈欢迎。
    东北劳模代表在八日上午回到沈阳。东北人民政府秘书长栗又文、东北总工会主席张维桢、东北军区政治部秘书长李麟等负责同志，亲到车站迎接。劳模们一下车，立即被群众所包围。群众向英雄热情的献花、握手和欢呼。中南区代表九日下午抵汉口，欢迎的群众向他们投掷鲜花，生龙活虎的腰鼓队、秧歌队尽情表演。戎冠秀回到保定，刚一下车，欢迎的群众就高呼：“母亲来了，欢迎我们的母亲！”她走到那里，群众都用这种亲切的称呼来欢迎她。上海铁路劳模代表马根生回到上海机务段，抢着和涌上来的工友们握手。他的手被正在作工的工友的手握黑了。劳模和工友们都浸沉在高度的阶级友爱中。
    在欢迎会和专门举行的劳模座谈会上，代表们向工友传达了毛主席和各位首长的指示，和这次全国劳模代表会议的经过、感想。河北省劳模回到保定，立即发表告全省工人农民书，号召全省劳动人民共同努力，坚决彻底地保证实现毛主席“建立强大的国防军和强大的经济力量”的指示。察哈尔省工业劳模代表马六孩向欢迎他的工友说：“我参加主席团和毛主席握手时，我真比见了老子娘还亲。过去反动派看我们比什么都臭。现在我们作了国家主人，受到政府首长和全国人民给的最高荣誉。毛主席所指示的要起带头作用、骨干作用、桥梁作用，我保证作到，团结工友，搞好生产，报答毛主席！”劳模们又介绍了马恒昌、赵国有的先进生产经验，号召工友学习。北京劳模代表侯德源说：“从这次大会里，我深深体会到要搞好生产，必须依靠群众。”
    代表们向各地群众充分揭露了美帝扩大侵略战争的阴谋。赵国有在沈阳车站向欢迎的群众说：“美帝国主义直接武装侵略我国领土台湾，再三用飞机扫射祖国的边疆，杀伤我国同胞，我们必须高度警惕，加紧准备力量，任何敌人胆敢冒险侵犯我国，我们就叫他走向灭亡！”旅大代表方忱流在大连车站欢迎大会上向群众说：“我们从北京带给你们坚决无比的信心，就是全国人民都决心解放台湾和西藏，美帝国主义如敢向我们挑衅，我们完全有力量打得它片甲不留！”西北工业劳模代表林师尧、孟玉琳回到西安，听说美国侵略军已越过朝鲜三八线，扩大侵朝战争，立誓回到工厂，动员全体工人弟兄，加速开快机器，努力生产，誓为支援解放全国领土和保卫祖国的后盾。
    劳模代表们详细地向欢迎者报告毛主席的近况。河北劳模代表回忆着和毛主席在一起时的情况说：“毛主席和我们握手，握得非常有劲，时间最少一分钟。在握手时，毛主席的眼睛凝视着你，使人感到异常的亲切，给了人们永铭的记忆和永恒的光荣。”五台山护林模范郭能成向群众形容毛主席说：“毛主席身材魁梧、健康，他的手又长又厚，我两个手还握不住哩。”上海代表潘阿耀回到厂里，工友们包围了他，争着看带有亲笔签字的毛主席照片。济南铁路劳模代表李信堂回到家里，从身上摸出毛主席和朱总司令的照片，他的老婆立刻说：“赶快做个镜框镶好挂起来。”
    代表们冷静地分析了这一次光荣的经历，一致认为：“我们劳动人民所以受到尊敬和欢迎，是在毛主席的领导下，把‘劳动创造世界’的真理恢复过来了。”大家因此得出结论：毛主席就是力量的源泉。西北劳模说：吃水忘不了挖井人，翻身忘不了毛主席。只要跟着毛主席走，我们永远是胜利的。
