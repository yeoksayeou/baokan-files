　　Good Movie Recommendation
    《They Have a Motherland》
    The Dongying translated film "They Have a Motherland" will be released simultaneously in the capital's Capital, Dahua, and New China theaters on the 28th of this month. This is a Soviet film with high ideological and artistic achievements. It points out the cunning and cruelty of Anglo-American imperialism, which is destroying the future happiness of innocent children; at the same time, it shows the infinite care that the Soviet government is giving to children. The story tells that during the Soviet-German war, the German Kou captured many Soviet people and children, concentrating these children in West Germany. After the war, these children fell into the hands of British imperialists, who changed their original names, disguised them as orphans, and prepared to train them to become their cannon fodder and slaves when they grew up.
    The Soviet government sent representatives to protest and negotiate with the British occupation authorities, but the British military authorities moved the "orphanage" in the middle of the night, attempting to evade this just negotiation. But finally, with the righteous assistance of the nanny and the German chauffeur, the struggle of the Soviet representative was victorious. The children safely returned to their motherland.
    Today, when American and British imperialists are actively trying to provoke a new war, the screening of this film is of great significance for defending world peace and opposing wars of aggression.

    《他们有祖国》
    东影翻译片《他们有祖国》将于本月二十八日在本市首都、大华、新中国三院同时上映。这是一部具有高度思想、艺术成就的苏联片。它指出了英美帝国主义的奸诈残酷、正在毁灭着天真无知的儿童的未来幸福；同时也显示出苏联政府对儿童正给以无限的关怀。故事叙述着苏德战争时期，德寇俘虏了许多苏联人民和孩子，把这许多孩子集中在西德。战争结束后，这些孩子又落在英帝国主义者手中，被改换了原来的姓名，伪装成孤儿，准备训练他们长大了充当他们的炮灰和奴隶。
    苏联政府派出代表，向英国占领当局提出抗议与交涉，而英军当局却把“孤儿院”在深夜里迁移，企图逃避这个正义的交涉，但终于在保姆和德国籍汽车夫的正义协助下，苏联代表所进行的斗争获得了胜利。孩子们安全地又回到他们的祖国。
    美英帝国主义正在积极想挑起新的战争的今天，放映这部影片，对于保卫世界和平，反对侵略战争有着巨大的意义。
