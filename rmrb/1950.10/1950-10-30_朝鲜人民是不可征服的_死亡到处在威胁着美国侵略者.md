　　The Korean People Are Invincible
    Death Threatens American Aggressors Everywhere
    Report by Bo Chengke, Correspondent of Pravda
    [Xinhua News Agency, 29th] TASS Moscow, 27th: Bo Chengke, special correspondent of Pravda, wrote when describing the current situation in South Korea: Every night, hundreds of ordinary people secretly cross the front line from the world of terror created by the U.S. military in South Korea and head to the areas occupied by the People's Army. They have neither property nor a place to settle down. The only thing they have is burning hatred for the invaders and the will to fight. They are all fathers without wives and children, or young people who have lost their parents. Today in Korea, there is not a single family that has not had someone shot, killed, or tortured to death by the hateful aggressors and the Lee Seung-man executioners.
    In the areas occupied by the American aggressors, everything of many residents has been robbed. The newly harvested rice and wheat this year have been completely requisitioned. In order to supply the Lee Seung-man bandit army and the mercenaries from the United States and Europe, the poor people have been burdened with unbearable burdens. The Americans violated all international agreements and forced prisoners of war to work in dangerous areas on the front line where artillery fire is raging. Not only that, the American cannibals give weapons to the prisoners of war and threaten them with machine guns from behind to engage in attacks. The Americans want to use blood to extinguish the inextinguishable flame of resistance of the Korean people. However, the land of Korea is burning under the feet of the American aggressors. There is no place in Korea where the American army can feel safe. Death threatens them everywhere.
    Workers in the copper mines of Seoul refused to mine ore for the Americans. A riot occurred in the Kanni lead mine. Engineers and mine bosses from the United States were all killed. American engineers spent two weeks building a bridge over the Han River. But two days later, it was blown up by patriotic volunteers.
    In the Nakdong River area, there was originally a guerrilla team of only twenty soldiers. However, it has now grown to hundreds of people and has machine guns and artillery.
    Bo Chengke continued: The rear of the U.S. military is like a dead desert, with destroyed towns and burned villages everywhere. Only in the deep mountains and ridges that Americans cannot reach can life be seen continuing, and entire areas of residents now live there. The People's Committee works there. Wounded soldiers of the People's Army are recuperating in caves. Free people, like eagles, live on high mountains.
    The guerrillas operating in South Korea are a huge organized force capable of long-term resistance. Fighting in these guerrilla teams are members of the Workers' Party and officers of the People's Army. They are well-equipped and have ample ammunition. Each guerrilla team has staff members who carefully plan each operation. Most of the highways in the south are under the control of the guerrillas, forcing the U.S. military to leave strong troops in the towns for defense and to send out a large number of convoys, often with armored vehicles and tanks. An American officer named Stone, who came out to carry out a crusade and was captured by the guerrillas, said: As long as the mountains are still there, the Korean people cannot be conquered. Stone said: Anyone who wants to destroy the morale of the Korean people must first flatten the mountains. But the mountains of Korea stand proudly and have stood for centuries, and will always stand like this, which is a symbol of the invincible free spirit of the heroic Korean people.

### 朝鲜人民是不可征服的  死亡到处在威胁着美国侵略者

　　朝鲜人民是不可征服的
    死亡到处在威胁着美国侵略者
    真理报记者波诚科报道
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯：真理报特派记者波诚科在叙述南朝鲜的现状时写道：每天晚上，数以百计的老百姓，从南朝鲜美军所造成的恐怖世界，偷偷地越过火线，奔向人民军部队所占领着的地区。他们既没有财产，也没有安身之所。他们唯一所有的就是对侵略者燃烧着的愤恨和战斗的意志。他们都是没有了妻子和儿女的父亲们，或者是失去了父母的青年们。今天在朝鲜，没有一个家庭没有人被可恨的侵略者与李承晚刽子手所枪毙、杀害或虐待至死的。
    在美国侵略者所占领的地区，许多居民的每一件东西都被抢走。今年新收获的米和麦，已经完全被征用了。为了供养李承晚匪军和从美国与欧洲开来的雇佣兵，贫苦人民的肩上加上了不能忍受的重担。美国人违反了一切国际协定，强迫战俘在炮火连天的前线危险地区工作。不仅如此，美国吃人生番们把武器给战俘，用机枪在背后威胁着他们从事进攻。美国人想用鲜血来扑灭消灭不了的朝鲜人民抵抗的怒火。然而，朝鲜的土地在美国侵略者的脚底下燃烧着。朝鲜没有一个地方可使美国军队感到安全。死亡到处威胁着他们。
    汉城铜矿工人拒绝为美国人开采矿砂。坎尼铅矿发生暴动。从美国来的工程师与矿工头子们都被击毙。美国工兵费了两个星期的时期，才在汉江上架起一座桥梁。但两天以后，它就被爱国志士炸毁了。
    在洛东江地区，原来有一支不过二十个战士的游击队。可是，现在它已经壮大到了好几百人，并拥有机枪和炮。
    波诚科继称：美军的后方，像是一片死寂的荒漠，到处是被摧毁的城镇和烧掉了的村落。只有在美国人到不了的深山峻岭中，才能看见生命在继续着，整片整片地区的居民现在都搬到那里住下来了。人民委员会在那里工作。人民军的伤员在山洞里养伤。自由的人民和雄鹰一样，住在高山之上。
    在南朝鲜活动的游击队，是一支能够进行长期抵抗的有组织的巨大力量。在这些游击队里作战的是劳动党的党员和人民军的军官。他们的装备良好，弹药充裕。每一支游击队都有参谋人员详细制订每一次作战的计划。南部的大部分公路都在游击队的控制之下，迫使美军不得不在城镇中留下强大的军队守备，并派出大量的护运队，其中常常有装甲车和坦克。有一个出来进行讨伐而被游击队俘虏的美国军官斯东说：只要山一天还在，朝鲜人民就被征服不了。斯东说：谁要想摧毁朝鲜人民的士气，首先就得把山夷平。但是朝鲜的山傲然屹立，已有多少世纪了，而且还要永远这样屹立下去，这是英勇的朝鲜人民不可征服的自由精神的象征。
