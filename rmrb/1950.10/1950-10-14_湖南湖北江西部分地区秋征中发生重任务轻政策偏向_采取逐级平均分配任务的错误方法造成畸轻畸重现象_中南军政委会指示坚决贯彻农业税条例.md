　　[This article is] From Changjiang Daily: In some areas of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, during the autumn grain collection, there has been a tendency to emphasize the task and downplay the policies, adopting the erroneous method of assigning tasks equally at each level, resulting in disproportionate burdens. This has attracted the attention of the Central South Financial and Economic Committee, which has begun to vigorously correct the situation.

　　The people's governments at all levels in the aforementioned provinces attach great importance to completing this year's grain collection task and generally pay attention to implementing policies and preventing commandism. In deploying the grain collection task, they generally go through discussions at the People's Representative Conferences at all levels, but some deviations have also occurred in the work.

　　The deviations that have occurred: The main problem is that when distributing the task, no attention was paid to the different levels of wealth in different regions and the different degrees of land concentration. The universal practice of assigning 13% equally at each level is inconsistent with the results of tax calculation according to the tax rate. Tangjiao Li Village in Zhifang District, Wuchang, Hubei is relatively rich, with an average income of 1,093 catties per person. If the tax is calculated according to the tax rate, the total tax amount of the village should account for 23.15% of the total income. However, Ma'an Village in Guangshui District, Yingcheng County is relatively poor, with an average income of 415 catties per person. If the tax is calculated according to the tax rate, the average tax amount of the village should only account for 9.33% of the total income. However, the average assignment of 13% will inevitably result in a light burden for rich villages and a heavy burden for poor villages; a light burden for villages with concentrated land ownership and a heavy burden for villages with scattered land ownership. According to the existing materials from the aforementioned provinces, in some relatively wealthy areas, tax calculation according to the tax rate can exceed the original assigned task by 10% to 60%. In Nanchang Prefecture, Jiangxi, it can exceed it by 66%. In a few poor mountainous areas, tax calculation according to the tax rate results in an average tax rate of less than 13%, and the task cannot be completed. In this case, some leading organs and cadres do not conscientiously study the policies, deeply understand the situation, master the materials, and correct and reasonably adjust the solution. Instead, they wrongly propose the so-called "fixed task, flexible tax rate" approach, failing to act in accordance with the regulations. In areas exceeding the task, the following situations occurred: some wanted to lower the tax rate, proposing to change the central government's tax rate table based on staple grains (generally rice in the south) to calculations based on polished rice; some wanted to reduce the scope of the burden; some applied "lower reductions, but no upper reductions"; some repeated last year's method of "collecting taxes by class"; some reduced the enthusiasm for opposing black fields and evaluating yields; and some developed a blind optimism and a careless and hasty approach. In areas where the task could not be completed, compulsory orders were adopted, such as Hunan's proposal of "evaluate and deliver at the same time," and even in individual townships (such as Chunhua Township in Changsha), most of the grain was stored in warehouses by midnight; Ji'an and Fuzhou Prefectures in Jiangxi put forward the slogan "arrange and store grain at the same time"; some inappropriately forced the masses to challenge and compete, completely abandoning the tax law and adopting the method of average apportionment; some relied solely on a few active elements to take the lead in reporting high yields, or adopted the method of universally measuring the land, attempting to complete the task in this way; individual cadres held the idea of "get the grain first, then adjust later" and "completing the task means doing a good job in the autumn grain collection."

　　The Changjiang Daily editorial pointed out that these deviations were still a matter of the ideology and work style of the cadres. First of all, some cadres do not pay attention to studying and implementing the agricultural tax law and reasonable burden policies. They resist the grain collection task, and therefore mistakenly believe that "policies and tasks are contradictory." Some only talk about policies, causing the task to drift freely, while others only talk about the task, disregarding policies. Both of these deviations hinder the progress of the grain collection task. The editorial then proposed correction methods. In addition to cadres conscientiously studying policies, mastering materials and situations, and acting in accordance with policies, it is also necessary to fully mobilize the masses, explain the tax law and clarify the principles through people's representative conferences and farmer representative conferences, and obtain the help of the masses to complete the task well.

　　To this end, the Central South Military and Political Committee and the Central South Financial and Economic Committee have issued instructions to correct the situation.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 13th: After the start of the autumn grain collection work in Central South China, all localities carried out in-depth publicity and mobilization, deployed work from top to bottom, and generally went through discussions at people's representative conferences at all levels and various cadre meetings to make it as fair and reasonable as possible. However, the phenomenon of excessively light and heavy burdens has been discovered in the work in some areas. In order to correct this deviation in a timely manner and prevent the deviation from continuing, the Central South Military and Political Committee issued an emergency instruction on the 4th. The instruction pointed out: When allocating burden tasks in some areas, no distinction was made according to the different concentration and dispersion of land in each region and the different average incomes per person, but only the 13% proportion of the total agricultural income of the nation was allocated on average, resulting in the phenomenon of excessively light and heavy burdens. The instruction stipulates: The task allocation should calculate the average agricultural income per person in each region, and then check the Interim Regulations on Agricultural Tax in New Areas to find the tax rate that should be levied for this average agricultural income, and then allocate the task in proportion to this tax rate. The tasks of the prefectures and counties generally do not need to be changed if they have been determined; those of the districts and townships that have not yet been determined or allocated to households should be re-allocated according to the above principles by convening an emergency farmer representative meeting. If the burden is too heavy after payment, it should be refunded; if it is too light, it should be supplemented according to the rate. Since rent is not temporarily paid, the public grain that should be borne by the landlord is paid by the tenant on behalf of the landlord. The instruction stipulates: For rented land where rent is not temporarily paid, the tenant shall first pay 20% of the normal annual output on behalf of the landlord (the public grain paid on behalf of the landlord shall be deducted from the rent when rent is paid). The public grain that should be paid for the rented land shall be borne by both the landlord and the tenant. The portion to be levied from the tenant shall be calculated by discounting the income after rent reduction by 20% and levying 9%, and the remainder shall be borne by the landlord.

　　湖南湖北江西部分地区秋征中发生重任务轻政策偏向
    采取逐级平均分配任务的错误方法造成畸轻畸重现象
    中南军政委会指示坚决贯彻农业税条例
    【本报讯】据长江日报消息：湘、鄂、赣部分地区在秋征中，发生逐级平均分配任务，不按税率计征，急于求成，潦草从事等重任务轻政策的偏向，造成畸轻畸重的现象。现已引起中南财经委员会注意，开始大力纠正。
    上述诸省各级人民政府，对完成今年征粮任务是很重视的，对贯彻政策、防止命令主义，一般比较注意。在布置征粮任务中，一般都经过各界人民代表会讨论，但在工作中，也发生了若干偏向。
    发生的偏向：主要是在分配任务时，没有注意到各地贫富不同和土地的集中程度不同，普遍的逐级按百分之十三平均分配，这样就与依率计征的结果发生悬殊。湖北武昌纸坊区塘角李村较富，每人平均收入一○九三斤，如依率计征，全村税额应占总收入百分之二三·一五；而应山县广水区马鞍村较穷，每人平均收入四一五斤，如依率计征，全村平均税额只应占总收入的百分之九·三三。但要平均按百分之十三分配，必然形成富村轻，穷村重；土地集中村轻，土地分散村重。据上述各省现有材料，若干较富地区，依率计征，可超过原分配任务百分之十至百分之六十。江西南昌专区可超过百分之六六。而少数贫瘠山区依率计征，平均税率不及百分之十三，完不成任务。在这种情况下，有些领导机关和干部，并不认真研究政策深入了解情况，掌握材料，加以纠正和合理的调整解决，却错误地提出所谓“死任务、活税率”的做法，不按条例办事。在超过任务的地区发生以下几种情况：有的要降低税率，提议将中央以主粮（江南一般为稻谷）为单位的税率表，改为以大米计；有的要缩小负担面；有的“下减上不减”；有的重复去年“划阶级征收”的办法；有的因此降低了反黑田、评产量的积极性；有的因此发生盲目乐观情绪和潦草从事、急于求成的做法。在任务完不成的地区，则又采取了强迫命令的办法，如湖南提出“边评边送”，甚至个别乡（如长沙春华乡）当天夜半大部入仓；江西吉安抚州专区提出“一面布置，一面入仓”的口号；有的则不适当地强制群众挑战、比赛，完全放弃税法，采用平均摊派的办法；有的则只依靠少数积极分子带头高报产量，或采取普遍量地的办法，企图以此完成任务；个别干部抱着“先拿到粮，回头再调整”和“完成任务就算做好了秋征工作”的思想。
    长江日报为此发表的社论中指出，发生这些偏向，还是干部的思想和作风问题。首先是在一部分干部中，不注意学习和执行农业税法和合理负担政策，对征粮任务存在着抵抗思想，因而错误地认为“政策与任务矛盾”，有的只空谈政策，使任务陷于自流，有的则只谈任务，不顾政策。这两种偏向，都阻碍着征粮任务的进行。社论中继即提出纠正办法，除干部认真学习政策，掌握材料和情况，按政策办事外，还必须充分发动群众，通过各界代表会议和农民代表会议讲明税法，说清原则，取得群众的帮助，才能很好完成任务。
    为此，中南军政委员会和中南财委会均发出指示纠正。
    【新华社汉口十三日电】中南秋征工作开始后，各地均作了深入的宣传动员，自上而下布置工作，一般均经各界人民代表会议和各种干部会议的讨论，尽可能地作到了公平合理。但部分地区工作中已有畸轻畸重的现象发现。中南军政委员会为及时纠正这一偏向，并防止偏向继续产生，特于四日发出紧急指示。指示指出：在有些地区分配负担任务时，没有根据各地区土地集中分散不同和每人平均收入不同而有所不同，只是按国民的农业总收入百分之十三的比例平均分配，因而造成畸轻畸重现象。指示规定：分配任务应算出各该地区国民的每人平均农业收入，再查新区农业税暂行条例，查出这个平均农业收入应征的税率，然后以这个税率作比例分配。专区和县的任务如已分定一般不必变动；区和乡尚未分定或尚未分配到户者，则应按上述原则，召开紧急的农民代表会议重新分配。如已缴纳，负担太重者应退还，过轻者应按率补征。由于暂不交租，地主应负担的公粮是由佃户代缴。指示规定：凡暂不交租的租佃地，由佃户按常年应产量先行代地主缴纳百分之二十（代缴的公粮，交租时从租额中扣除）。租佃地应缴的公粮，由主佃双方负担。佃户应征部分以减租后的收入打八折计算征百分之九，其余由地主负担。
