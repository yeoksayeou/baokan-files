Reflections on National Day
    Overseas Chinese Democratic Personage, Situ Meitang

    The achievements in various constructions since the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China a year ago have been extraordinarily great. It is truly delightful and beyond expectations that such great achievements can be rapidly established on the war-torn ruins of China. The development in this one year has surpassed the development of the past hundred years. The undeniable facts prove that the Central People's Government is truly a good government that works for the people; the undeniable facts prove that the people's democratic dictatorship has infinite superiority.

    The true liberation of the motherland and the unprecedented improvement of the motherland's international status have made the more than eleven million overseas Chinese scattered abroad feel the value and joy of freedom and independence. No matter how the imperialists oppress and deceive, the overseas Chinese's support for the motherland is becoming more and more enthusiastic. An orphan who has lost his mother, how much he craves the warmth of his mother's embrace!

    On this festive occasion, my first thought is: thanks to the wise and correct leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, and the heroic and skillful fighting of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who have brought the people out of the abyss of suffering. Without them, the Chinese revolution would be unimaginable. At present, the US imperialists are again attempting to invade China, and our domestic struggle against poverty and backwardness is still quite difficult and strenuous. The land reform to eliminate feudal forces still has two-thirds of the area waiting to be done. The Chinese people can only overcome difficulties and achieve complete victory by more firmly following the Chinese Communist Party and following Chairman Mao.

    My second thought is: the construction achievements of China in the past year are inseparable from the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet friends. They assisted the people in building iron bridges, controlling floods, engaging in production, preventing epidemics, and using patient instruction to pass on various knowledge and experiences to our workers and students, so that we can carry out construction and avoid detours. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other agreements that are beneficial to the Chinese people in overcoming difficulties have further stabilized the situation in China and moved it forward. This kind of brotherly friendship cannot but make the Chinese, who have a little conscience, awe and be greatly moved. Why do the Chinese lean to one side, leaning towards the socialist Soviet Union? The reasoning and facts are in front of us, how clear!

    My third thought: speaking from the perspective of an overseas Chinese on overseas Chinese affairs: the government has made great efforts to facilitate overseas remittances. Now, overseas remittances have greatly increased, which helps the prosperity of the overseas Chinese hometowns and the government's accumulation of foreign exchange. Secondly, regarding the resettlement and education of overseas Chinese students, appropriate care for poor overseas Chinese dependents, plans for production and famine relief in overseas Chinese hometowns, the resolution of overseas Chinese property disputes, and attention to the protection of overseas Chinese interests during land reform, these policies are well-defined, some are being implemented, and the results are satisfactory. However, overseas, the imperialists are afraid and hate the overseas Chinese who have raised their heads, and their oppression has intensified, and their rumor-mongering techniques have become more "skillful." The overseas Chinese are feeling great difficulties, and their understanding of the situation after the liberation of the motherland is still vague and confused. Therefore, launching diplomatic negotiations with imperialism to protect the safety of overseas Chinese, and launching organizational propaganda to overseas Chinese to strengthen the unity of the overseas Chinese themselves are both urgent tasks. We have not done these tasks well enough, which makes the overseas Chinese anxiously await and crave our timely efforts.

　　国庆志感
    华侨民主人士  司徒美堂
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立这一年来，各种建设成绩是异常巨大的，在疮痍满目的中国废墟上能迅速建立起如此巨大的成绩来，真叫人喜出望外。今年一年的发展超过过去一百年的发展。无可争论的事实证明：中央人民政府是真正替人民做事的好政府；无可争论的事实证明：人民民主专政有无限的优越性。
    祖国的真正解放，祖国在国际地位的空前提高，使散处海外的一千一百多万侨胞感到自由独立的可贵和可喜，不论帝国主义者如何压迫骗诈，侨胞对祖国的拥戴支持是越来越热烈了，失了母亲的孤儿，是如何渴望母亲怀抱的温暖！
    当此佳节，我的第一个感想是：感谢毛泽东主席和中国共产党领导的英明正确，中国人民解放军的英勇善战，出人民于水深火热之中。没有了他们，中国的革命是不可想象的。目前美帝国主义者又妄图侵略中国，我们国内对贫穷落后的斗争也还相当困难吃力，肃清封建势力的土地改革还有三分之二的地区等待去做，中国人民唯有更坚决的跟着中国共产党走，跟着毛主席走，才能战胜困难，达到完全胜利。
    第二点感想是：中国一年来的建设成绩是与苏联朋友的热情援助分不开的。他们协助人民筑铁桥、治水灾、搞生产、防疫疠，并且用诲人不倦的精神把各种智识经验传授给我们的工人学生，使我们进行建设，少走弯路。中苏友好同盟互助条约和其他有益于中国人民战胜困难的协定，更使中国把局面稳定下来，迈步向前。这种兄弟情谊，不能不叫稍具良心的中国人肃然起敬，大受感动。——中国人为什么要一边倒，倒向以社会主义苏联为首这一边？道理和事实摆在眼前，何等明白！
    第三点感想：以华侨身份讲华侨工作：政府对侨汇之便利，曾付出很大努力，现在是侨汇大增，有助于侨乡繁荣和政府的积蓄外汇。次如对华侨学生之安置教育，贫苦侨眷之适当照顾，侨乡生产度荒之计划，华侨产业纠纷之解决，土改时对华侨利益之注意保护等，这些政策定得很好，有的正在做了，成绩使人满意。但在海外方面，帝国主义者对于抬起头来的侨胞是又怕又恨，压迫反而比前加紧了，造谣技俩也更“巧妙”了，华侨处境大感困难，对祖国解放后情况的了解，仍在模糊迷惑中。故此，对帝国主义展开外交交涉，借以保护华侨安全，对华侨展开组织宣传，借以加强侨胞本身团结，都是急不容缓之举。而这些工作，我们实在还不曾做得好，很使华侨焦思渴望，有待于我们的及时努力。
