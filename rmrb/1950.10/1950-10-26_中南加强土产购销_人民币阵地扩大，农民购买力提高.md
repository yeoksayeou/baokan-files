Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 24th: The Central-South District State-Owned Native Produce Company is actively strengthening its native produce purchasing and sales work. In the three months of July, August, and September, the company invested over 100 billion yuan in purchasing native products, not including the amount entrusted to private merchants. The various native products directly purchased by the company, except for a small portion allocated to state-owned factories and state organs, have mostly been sold in the domestic market. Another portion has been organized for export.

The Central-South region is known for its abundant native produce. Thanks to the strong support of local people's governments and the large-scale purchases by state-owned companies, this year's output has increased significantly compared to previous years. For example, the famous tussah silk in Henan province had an annual output of about 2,500 dan before liberation, but this year it has increased to about 5,000 dan. Tea production in Hunan has increased fivefold compared to last year, recovering to 30% of its peak output before the Anti-Japanese War. The harvest of other products such as ramie, cane sugar, peanuts, and various mountain goods and medicinal materials has also been greater than in previous years. Since August, the state-owned native produce companies have gradually improved their business policies, focusing on concentrating efforts on managing several major native products and accurately grasping prices. They have vigorously organized and united cooperatives and private merchants, dividing labor and cooperating to carry out the purchasing and sales of native products. At the same time, they have organized private merchants to raise funds for joint purchasing and joint sales through joint ventures, public-private partnerships, and other means. In addition, they have established agency purchasing and sales relationships with private merchants, actively supporting native produce merchants through methods such as hypothecated advances and ordering goods. In purchasing, the native produce companies in various places have begun to correct the shortcomings of blind purchasing since August, gradually implementing the policy of "determining purchases based on sales."

Due to the improvement in the management policies of the Central-South District Native Produce Company, coupled with the coordinated efforts of state-owned oil, pig bristles, and tea companies, and the support of loans from the People's Bank, the trade in native produce in the Central-South region has been greatly active in the past two months, and the prices of native produce have also become more reasonable. Private merchants, seeing the potential for profit, are more actively engaged in the native produce business. In August, the number of private merchants in Wuhan engaged in the export of native produce increased from 11 to more than 30. In early September, the export volume of various native products in Hengyang increased by two to three times compared to early August, most of which were distributed by private merchants. The market transactions in the entire region have therefore become more active. For example, in Pingjiang County, Hunan, due to the brisk sales of various native products and grains, the sales volume of various industrial products in September increased by one-third compared to August. In the past, almost all transactions in the vast rural markets of the county were based on barter, but since August, more than 80% of farmers have been using RMB for transactions. In the vast mountainous areas of Baokang and Nanzhang counties in Hubei province, farmers who had not been able to afford salt for many years are now able to buy salt because tung oil, pig bristles, and various mountain goods and medicinal materials have markets.

　　中南加强土产购销
    人民币阵地扩大，农民购买力提高
    【新华社汉口二十四日电】中南区国营土产公司积极加强土产购销工作。七、八、九三个月中，全区各级土产公司投入收购土产的资金达一千余亿元，委托私商收购的数目尚不包括在内。各级土产公司直接收购的各种土产，除小部分拨给国营工厂和国家机关使用外，大部分已在国内市场销出。另一部分则已组织出口。
    中南区土产素称丰饶。由于各地人民政府的大力扶植和国营公司的大量收购，今年产量比往年增加很多。如河南著名的柞蚕丝，解放前年产量约二千五百担，今年增加至五千担左右。湖南的茶叶较去年增产五倍，已恢复到抗日战争前最高产量的百分之三十。其他如苎麻、蔗糖、花生及各种山货、药材等的收获量也都比往年大。国营土产公司自八月份以来，即逐渐改善经营方针，以集中力量经营几种主要土产，正确掌握价格为主，大力组织与团结合作社和私商，分工合作，开展土产的购销工作，同时并通过联营，公私合营等方式，组织私商集资实行联购联销。此外并与私商建立代购代销关系，以押汇代运及订货等办法，积极扶助土产商贩。在收购中，各地土产公司自八月份起已开始纠正盲目收购的缺点，逐步贯彻“以销定购”的方针。
    由于中南区土产公司经营方针改进，加以国营油脂、猪鬃、茶叶等公司的配合努力和人民银行贷款的扶植，中南区土产交易近两个月来大为活跃，土产价格亦已趋向合理，私商因有利可图，更加积极地经营土产。八月份武汉市经营土产出口业的私商已由十一家增加到三十多家。九月上旬衡阳各项土产输出量比八月上旬普遍增加了二倍到三倍，其中绝大部分为私商经销。全区市场交易因此更加活跃。如湖南平江县由于各种土产及粮食畅销，九月份各种工业品销售量比八月份增加了三分之一。该县广大乡镇市场过去几乎全是以物易物，但从八月份起，已有百分之八十以上的农民使用人民币交易。湖北省保康、南漳等县的广大山区农民，过去长年吃不到盐，现在由于桐油、猪鬃及各种山货、药材有了销路，大部都有盐吃了。
