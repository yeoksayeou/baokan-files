　　Facing Imminent Financial Difficulties
    France and Britain Beg the U.S. for Massive Military Aid
    [Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch] French Defense Minister Moch and Finance Minister Petsche recently went to the United States and began talks with U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, Defense Secretary Marshall, and Treasury Secretary Snyder in Washington on the 13th, requesting the United States to resolve the serious financial difficulties France faces in implementing the U.S.-mandated military expansion plan, and requesting the U.S. to quickly aid the French colonial army, which recently suffered an unprecedented defeat in Vietnam.
    According to a Washington dispatch from the United Press, France "demanded that the United States provide a total of $3.17 billion in weapons and money in 1951" in the first meeting held on the 13th. The specific allocation was: weapons worth $2.1 billion to equip the new French army, $300 million to support the French-Vietnamese colonial forces in Vietnam, and $770 million to make up for the deficit in the huge military expenditure of approximately $2.45 billion (850 billion francs) for 1951, which is double that of this year. This request from France fully demonstrates that the French government, due to the emptiness of its own strength, has had to place all its hopes on U.S. "aid." However, this huge sum proposed by France exceeds more than half of the $5.2 billion in military aid appropriations that the United States plans to use to support the military preparations of all its vassal states, and the United States is unable to meet France's demands. According to the United Press, "At the beginning of the U.S.-French talks on the 13th, Acheson, Marshall, and Snyder told their French colleagues that their request for U.S. aid was too high." At the same time, the United States vigorously opposed France's plan to establish complete naval, land, and air forces, advocating that France should concentrate its military reorganization on "the tasks assigned to France in the North Atlantic Treaty plan"—mainly to supply "ground forces." This means they only want France to provide cannon fodder.
    The progress of the meeting showed that, as Petsche had admitted in advance when he met reporters upon his arrival in New York on the 12th: "Negotiations are very difficult" (Agence France-Presse). So far, according to the USIS, apart from Marshall's assurance to Moch that he would "do his best to speed up the transportation of military equipment" to aid the French colonial army in Vietnam, no concrete agreement has been reached on the so-called "financial problems of rearmament" in France. The meeting is still proceeding slowly.
    Before the U.S.-French meeting began, British Economic Affairs Minister Gaitskell and Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber also went to the United States one after another to beg the U.S. government to resolve the financial difficulties in rearmament. According to a Washington dispatch from the United Press on the 8th, Britain, like France, needs the United States to provide "imminent financial assistance" and "needs the United States to immediately undertake the obligation to assist its long-term military expansion."

### 面临着刻不容缓的财政困难  法英向美乞求庞大军援

　　面临着刻不容缓的财政困难
    法英向美乞求庞大军援
    【新华社十七日讯】法国国防部长莫克与财政部长比许于最近赴美，并于十三日和美国国务卿艾奇逊、国防部长马歇尔、财政部长斯奈德在华盛顿开始会谈，要求美国解决法国在实现美国命令的扩军计划中所面临的严重财政困难，并要求美国迅速援助最近在越南惨遭空前失败的法国殖民军。
    据合众社华盛顿消息：法国在十三日举行的第一次会议中，法国“要求美国于一九五一年给以总额达三十一亿七千万美元的武器和金钱”，其中具体分配为：以价值二十一亿美元的武器装备法国新军，以三亿美元支持越南的法越殖民军队，以七亿七千万美元用于弥补较之本年度增加一倍的一九五一年度约二十四亿五千万美元（八千五百亿法郎）的巨额军费中的不敷部分。法国这次要求，充分表示法国政府由于其本身力量的空虚，已不得不把一切希望寄托在美国的“援助”上。但是法国所提出的这一庞大数目，竟超过了美国准备用以支持其全体附庸国备战的五十二亿的美元军援拨款的半数以上，美国无力满足法国的要求。据合众社称：“十三日美法会谈开始时，艾奇逊、马歇尔、斯奈德即告诉他们的法国同僚称：他们对美援的要求过高。”美国同时竭力反对法国要建立完整的海陆空军各兵种的计划，主张法国应将其整军范围，集中于“北大西洋公约计划中所分配给法国的任务”——主要在于供给“地面部队”。这就是只要法国供给炮灰。
    会议的进程显示：正如比许在十二日刚抵纽约时接见记者时所预先承认的那样：“洽商是非常困难的”（法新社）。迄今为止，据美新处报道，除马歇尔已向莫克保证“将竭力加紧运输军事装备”以援助法国在越南的殖民军以外，关于法国所谓“重整军备的财政问题”，尚未取得具体协议。会议仍在缓缓进行中。
    在美法开始会议以前，英国经济事务大臣贾兹克尔与奥地利外长格鲁伯，也相继赴美，向美国政府乞求解决重整军备方面的财政困难问题。据合众社华盛顿八日电称：英国和法国一样需要美国给予“刻不容缓的财政援助”，并“需要美国立即承担义务，援助其进行长期扩军”。
