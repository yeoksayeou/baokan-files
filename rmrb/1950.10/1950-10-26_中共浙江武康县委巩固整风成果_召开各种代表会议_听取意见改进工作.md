　　CCP W康 County Committee, Zhejiang Province Consolidates Rectification Achievements:
    Convening Various Representative Meetings to Solicit Opinions and Improve Work
    [Our Dispatch] To consolidate the achievements of the rectification campaign and improve its work, the CCP W康 County Committee of Zhejiang Province convened district peasant representative conferences, teacher conferences, and merchant representative conferences in September. Through these meetings, it extensively collected opinions from people from all walks of life, further exposed shortcomings and errors in its work, and strengthened the relationship between the Party and the masses.
    At these meetings, the leaders of the CCP W康 County Committee made profound self-criticisms, sincerely solicited everyone's opinions, dispelled certain concerns among the representatives, and encouraged them to boldly expose shortcomings and errors in the work and provide many valuable constructive suggestions. At the peasant representative conference, representatives reflected that during the grain requisition last year, there were instances of uneven burden distribution and random beatings and arrests. Some cadres detained more than a dozen poor and lower-middle peasants who could not pay their grain quotas in a single night. Some representatives reflected that the government was excessively lenient towards petty thieves, vagrants, and bandits. Qing Quanchang, the village head of the third village in the Shangbai district, said: "I dare not catch bandits anymore. Last time, I caught four guys destroying the forest and sent them to the government, but the district government released them and detained me for four hours and fined me nine *sheng* of rice." Some representatives reflected that cadres used coercion and commandism and took over everything in the production campaign. For example, some cadres threatened the masses with guns to catch insects, saying, "If you don't catch insects, we'll shoot you!" When harnessing the river, they ordered the masses to repair the dam, and when the masses did not understand, they were hung up. This was originally a good thing that benefited the masses, but it caused dissatisfaction among the masses. The masses reflected, "This is being built for the government, otherwise the government will have nothing to collect public grain from!" Merchants reflected that some government cadres were rude and often said, "Merchants are intermediate exploiters, and there are no merchants who are not奸 (*jian*, cunning/treacherous/deceitful)." They criticized the government for failing to correctly grasp the policy of benefit to both labor and capital, which resulted in some workers being lazy and demanding excessively high wages. Teachers reflected that some cadres were pompous and used big labels, making it impossible to approach them for fear of "ideological problems" and "standpoint problems."
    Through these meetings, people from all walks of life gained a deeper understanding of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and the relationship between the Party and the masses was initially strengthened. At the meetings, everyone put forward ways to improve work in the future. At the peasant representative conference, the representatives seriously selected model workers in production and river management, exposed village cadres who were corrupt, selfish, colluded with landlords, and were divorced from the masses, and discussed future production tasks. Chen Guifang, a representative from the third village in Shangbai district, said: "When I go back, I will first do my best to protect the forest and learn from the people of Shanmin Township." (Shanmin Township does a good job in forest protection). At the merchant representative conference, everyone enthusiastically discussed the issue of curbing tax evasion. Huang Qixiang, a representative from the suburbs, said: "The unfair distribution of burdens is not only a problem for the government, but we merchants ourselves have more problems. To be fair, when merchants assess business tax, they all want to find bargains." Everyone agreed that "Burdens must be fair, and tax evasion must be curbed. We can't rely solely on the government for these things; we ourselves must also be responsible." The merchants formulated measures to curb tax evasion: "Divide into groups, guarantee each other, and report each other." Everyone also expressed that they would actively publicize the significance of paying taxes and educate merchants when they returned. The gentry expressed that they would extensively publicize to the landlord class when they returned, honestly abide by government laws and regulations, and strictly prohibit acts of destroying forests and sabotaging land reform.

　　中共浙江武康县委巩固整风成果
    召开各种代表会议  听取意见改进工作
    【本报讯】中共浙江省武康县委会为了巩固整风成果，改进工作，特于九月份先后召开了区农代会、教员会议、商代会议。通过这些会议，广泛搜集各界人士的意见，进一步揭发工作中的缺点与错误，密切党群关系。
    在这几个会议上，中共武康县委领导上均深刻地作了检讨，诚恳地征求大家的意见，解除了代表中的某些顾虑，使他们敢于大胆地揭发工作中的缺点与错误，并提供了不少宝贵的建设性意见，农代会上代表们反映，政府去年征粮时发生畸轻畸重与乱打、乱捕现象。有的干部一个晚上就押了十几个交不了粮的中贫农。有的代表反映政府对小偷、流氓、土匪，宽大无边。上柏区第三村青全长说：“以后我再不敢捉土匪了，上次我捉住了四个破坏森林的家伙，送到政府，区政府却把这四个人放了，反而把我押了四个钟头，罚了九升米。”有的代表反映干部在生产运动中强迫命令，包办代替。如有些干部拿枪威胁群众捉虫，说是：“再不捉虫，就毙你们！”在治河时命令群众修坝，群众思想一时不通就吊起来，本是对群众有利的好事，结果却引起群众不满。群众反映：“这是给政府修的，否则政府没得收公粮了！”商人反映，有些政府干部态度蛮横，动不动就说：“商人是中间剥削，无商不奸”。他们批评政府不能正确掌握劳资两利政策，致使一些职工工作散漫，要求过高工资。教员们反映：有些干部道貌岸然，大帽子满天飞，不敢靠近，唯恐发生什么“思想问题”，“立场问题”。
    通过这几个会议，各界人民对共产党与人民政府有了进一步的认识，初步密切了党群关系。会议上，大家提出了今后改进工作的办法。农代会上代表们认真的评选了生产、治河中的模范工作者，检举了贪污自私、勾结地主、脱离群众的乡村干部，并讨论了今后生产任务。上柏区第三村代表陈贵芳说：“回去首先尽力作好保护森林工作，向山民乡学习。”（山民乡护林很好）。商代会上大家热烈讨论了制止逃税问题，城郊代表黄其祥说：“负担分配的不公平，不光是政府的问题，我们商人本身毛病更多。说句公正话，商人评议营业税时，都想找便宜，大家一致认为：“负担要公平，必须制止逃税，制止逃税，这些事情不能单靠政府，我们自己也要负责。”商人们制订了制止逃税办法：“划分小组、相互保证、相互检举。”大家并表示，回去积极宣传纳税的意义，教育商人。士绅们表示回去向地主阶级广泛宣传，老老实实遵守政府法令，严禁破坏森林，破坏土改的行为。  （费黑）
