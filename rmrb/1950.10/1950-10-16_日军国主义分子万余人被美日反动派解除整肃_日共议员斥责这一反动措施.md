Xinhua News Agency, October 14th: While the US and Japanese reactionaries are intensifying their suppression of the Japanese democratic movement and continuously and illegally "purging" progressive individuals, they have openly lifted the sanctions against a large number of militarists in order to accelerate the revival of Japanese militarism and make them tools for the US to expand its war of aggression. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese Yoshida government announced on the 13th that MacArthur Headquarters had approved the removal of 10,090 Japanese militarists from the purge list. These many individuals who have been pardoned were engaged in militarist and extreme nationalist activities during the war. After the surrender of fascist Japan, MacArthur, under the pressure of world opinion, was forced to announce their purge.

This reactionary measure of lifting the sanctions was a long-planned conspiracy between the US and Japanese reactionaries. A "senior occupation officer" of the US told the International News Service reporter on the 13th: Regarding the list of those to be pardoned, "we (referring to the US and Japanese reactionaries) held several meetings beforehand." Among the more than 10,000 people who have been pardoned this time and restored to public office, according to the Central News Agency of the Kuomintang, are prominent Japanese political figures, financial and industrial tycoons, and writers, publishers, and journalists who advocated the war of aggression during the war. These include: more than 500 people related to financial groups, 46 former members of the Diet recommended by Hideki Tojo, more than 3,000 career military officers, more than 3,000 veterans, more than 2,000 people related to the fascist organization "Imperial Rule Assistance Association", more than 200 reactionary journalists and writers, and other aggressors. Rikizo Hirano, former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in the Katayama Cabinet, Tokutaro Kimura, former Minister of Justice in the first Yoshida Cabinet, Ryosei Kawai, former Minister of Health and Welfare, Daizaburo Tsugita, former Chief Secretary of the Shidehara Cabinet, and Rujiro Okubo, former Mayor of Tokyo, are all on this list of those who have had sanctions lifted.

According to United Press, Japanese Communist Party members have denounced this attempt by reactionaries to restore militarism in the Diet on the 13th of this month.

　　日军国主义分子万余人被美日反动派解除整肃
    日共议员斥责这一反动措施
    【新华社十四日讯】美、日反动派在加紧镇压日本民主运动、不断非法“整肃”进步人士的同时，已公然解除大批军国主义分子的整肃处分，以加速复活日本军国主义，使他们充当美国扩大侵略战争的工具。据美联社东京讯：日本吉田政府十三日宣布，麦克阿瑟总部已批准将日本军国主义分子一万零九十人自整肃名单上除名。这许多被解除整肃者，战时都曾从事军国主义的及极端国家主义的活动。法西斯日本投降后，麦克阿瑟在世界舆论的压力下，曾被迫宣布加以整肃。
    这次解除整肃的反动措施，是美、日反动派密谋已久的。美国“某高级占领军官”十三日告国际新闻社记者说：关于解除整肃的名单，“事先我们（按指美、日反动派）曾举行数次会议”。在这次被解除整肃、恢复公权的一万多人中，据国民党中央社透露，包括战时日本著名政界人物、财政和工业巨子以及鼓吹侵略战争的作家、出版家、新闻记者等。其中计有：与财阀有关者五百余人，为东条英机所推荐的前国会议员四十六人，职业军官三千余人，在乡军人三千余人，与法西斯组织“大政翼赞会”有关者二千余人，反动新闻记者及作家二百余人，以及其他侵略分子。前片山内阁农林相平野力三、前第一届吉田内阁法相（司法大臣）木村笃太郎及厚生相河合良成、前币原内阁书记长官次田大三郎以及前东京市长大久保留次郎等均在此次解除整肃之列。
    另据合众社讯，日本共产党议员已于本月十三日在国会中，对反动派这一企图恢复军国主义的措施，加以斥责。
