(I) Overview of Work Over the Past Year

Over the past year, the organization of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation has developed relatively extensively. According to incomplete statistics, democratic women's federations or preparatory committees have been established in 31 provinces, 83 cities, and 1,287 counties in the four major administrative regions, connecting more than 30 million women through various women's mass organizations. Looking back on the work of this year, it represents a step forward on the basis of the original work. From the Second Executive Committee meeting until December, the main task was to accept the entrustment of the International Democratic Women's Federation, prepare for, and convene the Asian Women's Representative Conference. Starting in 1950, specific guidelines and tasks for the women's movement in 1950, as well as the key points of the work of the All-China Women's Federation, were formulated. The focus of work was placed on various regions, strengthening the leadership of local women's federations as much as possible, especially focusing on understanding and studying the work situation of women in large and medium-sized cities and the problems that exist. To this end, executive committee members, standing committee members, and deputy ministers of the federation were dispatched to Tianjin, Shenyang, Zhangjiakou, Shanghai, Chahar, Hebei, and the Central South Administrative Region, either to participate in local women's representative conferences and women's work conferences, or to investigate and understand the local women's work situation. Work report meetings were held for responsible cadres from Tianjin, Shanghai, Shanxi, and Suiyuan. Through these activities, as well as general written reports and correspondence, contact with local women's federations was initially strengthened and certain work was improved.

The important work of the past year is reported separately as follows:

First, adhering to the principle of organizing women to participate in production as the central task: Since the First National Women's Congress of China decided to take organizing women to participate in production as the central task, women's federations in various regions have strived to implement this principle and have achieved results. In terms of industrial production, women's federations in various cities, in coordination with trade unions, have focused on women workers' work, assisting the women workers' departments of trade unions in carrying out work such as improving production, cultural education, childcare, and maternal and child health among women workers. Efforts have also been made to overcome difficulties and organize some impoverished working women to participate in handicraft production, achieving results. In terms of agriculture, women's federations in various regions have cooperated with local governments, paying attention to mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production, and organizing women to participate in spring plowing, summer weeding, and summer harvesting. In the old liberated areas, the participation of women in agricultural production generally reached 50% to 70%, and some semi-old areas also reached 40%. According to statistics from more than 1,500 villages in nine special districts of Hebei, the number of women participating in long-term and temporary mutual aid groups reached more than 35,000. The agricultural skills of some advanced women in the old liberated areas have also improved compared to last year. In disaster areas, the main focus was on combining production with disaster relief. The All-China Women's Federation sent people to severely affected areas such as the plains and northern Jiangsu three times for inspection, pointing out that women's federations in disaster areas should focus on organizing women to produce and provide disaster relief, correcting the tendency of individual women's federations to neglect disaster relief tasks.

However, in implementing the principle of taking production as the central task, women's federations in various regions also encountered many difficulties. Because some cadres did not understand how to implement this principle according to specific circumstances, it caused some doubts about this principle. This year, the "Guidelines and Tasks of the Chinese Women's Movement in 1950" published by this association, and the "Notice Commemorating 'March 8' International Working Women's Day" jointly published with the four major national people's organizations, clearly adhered to the principle of women's participation in production as the central task, and specifically issued the "Notice to Women's Federations at All Levels on Organizing Rural Women to Complete the Annual Agricultural Production Tasks" in the spring.

Our shortcomings are that we have failed to issue instructions in a timely manner according to objective needs, and most of them are limited to general appeals, failing to combine with the specific circumstances of urban and rural areas and point out specific methods for implementing this principle, thus failing to effectively help various regions solve difficulties. Secondly, the scope of work of the Production Department of the All-China Women's Federation was not clearly defined last year, and there was even an opinion to abolish the Production Department at one point. Although the organization of the Production Department has now been affirmed and its business has been clearly defined, its work has not been developed due to the lack of a clear focus and incomplete staffing.

Second, regarding women and children's welfare: We assisted the Legislative Affairs Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council in completing the draft of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China. After the official promulgation and implementation by the Central People's Government, we jointly issued a joint notice with the four major national people's organizations to support the new Marriage Law, notifying people's organizations at all levels to widely publicize and educate the masses, and assist the government in implementing it. The All-China Women's Federation itself has also carried out publicity, education, and interpretation of the Marriage Law in various ways from various aspects. At the Second Session of the National Committee of the CPPCC, a proposal was put forward for women's federations in various regions to participate in the jury of marriage cases, which has been passed and sent to the government for verification.

We advocated for the establishment and improvement of various kinds of childcare institutions and kindergartens for female workers and staff members, and carried out maternal and child health work, such as uniting medical personnel (especially midwives, etc.) to promote maternal and child health knowledge, transforming old-style midwives, and piloting maternal and child health stations, etc., to help some women solve some of the difficulties they encounter in raising children while participating in production (or work), so as to improve women's production efficiency and promote children's health. In particular, through the work of commemorating "June 1" International Children's Day, the importance of protecting children's rights was widely publicized, and proposals were made on the guiding principles, tasks, and priorities of childcare work in urban and rural areas in the future. These opinions have attracted the attention of some women's federation cadres and childcare work cadres, who have studied and discussed them as a basis for improving their work. Most local women's federations conscientiously carried out childcare work. At present, there are a total of 643 various public and private childcare institutions across the country, taking care of 31,794 children, which is more than five times the 147 nurseries that existed nationwide before liberation. In addition, there are 183 public and private children's education and care institutions, providing education and care for a total of 23,790 orphans and refugees. According to reports from 18 provinces, 67 childcare training classes have been opened, training more than 1,850 childcare cadres.

Third, in terms of propaganda and education: In order to adapt to the needs of the construction cause of the new China, and in view of the thoughts and work of women cadres, we called on them to strengthen their studies and improve their abilities. This year, when commemorating "March 8" Women's Day, we published the editorial "Learn Skills and Do a Good Job" through Xinhua News Agency, requiring women cadres in various regions to study it, so they have improved to varying degrees in their thinking and have led women to study. In addition, the New China Women's Vocational School, sponsored by the All-China Women's Federation, has graduated its first batch of more than 350 students, and is now being expanded, focusing on training women cadres from women's work and worker-peasant backgrounds, as well as female technicians.

Over the past year, we have insisted on editing and publishing the New China Women's Monthly, which has played a certain role in publicity and education for women cadres and the masses. However, there are still many shortcomings in this regard, especially the lack of connection with reality and the lack of guidance. The common knowledge teaching materials for worker-peasant women attached to the journal have now been reprinted and adopted by seven provinces and cities, which has helped promote worker-peasant women's education. However, it still needs to be improved in terms of content and form. In addition, we responded to the call of the International Democratic Women's Federation and implemented its resolutions, especially the work of commemorating "June 1" International Children's Day and the world peace signature campaign, which expanded internationalist propaganda and education. We are now further expanding and strengthening the peace signature campaign and carrying out propaganda work against the US aggression against Taiwan and Korea. There are still shortcomings in our work, mainly manifested in the failure to conduct in-depth inspections and help local women's federations improve their work, and the failure to expand propaganda work among the masses in a timely and systematic manner. Therefore, this work has not kept up with objective needs.

Fourth, adhering to the advocacy of establishing women's representative conferences: Since the First National Women's Congress of China last year determined that "women's organizations in urban and rural areas of the liberated areas should mainly take the form of women's representative conferences," most local women's federations have successively established various kinds of women's representative conferences, creating experience, proving that this organizational form is both a better way to unite women more widely and the best organizational form to effectively promote work. However, some regions still have cadres who do not sufficiently understand the organizational role of women's representative conferences, or are still limited to the past practice of individual membership in women's federations, or have abolished the organizational role of women's representative conferences, only considering them a way to convey decisions from higher levels, thus hindering the promotion of women's representative conferences.

To this end, the All-China Women's Federation has made some efforts, successively publishing articles on women's representative conferences, mainly criticizing the closed-door and formalistic phenomena in convening women's representative conferences, and answering the main existing problems of urban and rural women's representative conferences. These opinions have attracted the attention of some local women's federations and have played a certain role in promoting women's representative conferences, but they have failed to give more systematic and powerful instructions in a timely and clear manner targeting the important problems existing in various regions.

Fifth, in terms of international work: The All-China Women's Federation's international propaganda and liaison work has become increasingly heavy with the victory of the Chinese revolution. Last year, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation was entrusted by the International Democratic Women's Federation to preside over the preparation and convening of the Asian Women's Representative Conference, which decided on the guiding principles and tasks of the Asian women's movement, and encouraged the Asian women's liberation struggle. It will not only play an important role in promoting the Asian women's movement, but also play a certain role in the Asian national liberation struggle. The resolutions of the Asian Women's Representative Conference were conveyed domestically, and internationalist education was carried out. People were also sent to attend the International Democratic Women's Federation's Council meeting in Moscow and the Ninth Executive Committee meeting in the capital of Finland, as well as to participate in the Chinese People's Delegation celebrating the national day of Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and North Korea. Various possible opportunities were used to introduce the victory of the Chinese revolution and the situation and experience of the heroic struggle of Chinese women. In addition, assistance was given to representatives from some Southeast Asian countries for study. There has been progress and development in terms of solidarity and contact between us and international friends, but we have insufficient understanding of this increasingly heavy international task, and the work is still passive.

Sixth, work of the association's office: Inside the association's office, further consolidation has been carried out on the basis of the original work, necessary work systems have been established, the scope of work of various departments has been gradually clarified, and the work of the office has gradually become regularized. The unity between cadres of various parties and non-party cadres has been increasingly strengthened. However, the system has not been strictly implemented, work is not checked regularly, and meetings are not prepared adequately, especially the understanding and research on the situation of women's work in various regions is insufficient.

Secondly, this year, more contact has been established with national people's organizations and relevant agencies, such as jointly issuing notices and telegrams with national people's organizations, and jointly holding meetings to complete a task, expanding the influence of work and promoting work, and exchanging work experiences with each other. We believe that the principle of coordination is to objectively assess the situation of all parties according to work needs, focus on actively striving to coordinate with relevant parties, avoid unprepared, accidental, and indiscriminate coordination, so as not to disperse our strength, make the work lose its center, and fall into a passive problem. The content of coordination should be based on the established central work and newly added common work. Whenever it is conducive to implementing equality between men and women, protecting the rights and interests of women and children, and promoting women's work, when the relevant parties are neglected, attention should be paid to making suggestions. Whenever it is related to this, attention should be paid to considering and accepting the assigned tasks. The method of coordination should first be individual and temporary consultation, gradually progressing to a certain business and regular organizational contact, selecting and dispatching appropriate personnel to attend invited or strive to participate in relevant meetings and organizations. The standing committee members who hold concurrent posts in various departments should pay attention to striving for coordination.

In the process of carrying out the work, we have encountered many difficulties. Some come from objective aspects, which are the difficulties brought about by the transition period and victorious development, such as the increasingly national scale of the organization and business of women's work, and the increasingly heavy international tasks. Some come from subjective aspects, such as unfamiliarity with business, insufficient experience, unsound institutions, incomplete staffing of necessary cadres, the political and ideological level of existing cadres is not high or uniform, there is still a subjective and transactional style, some cadres have not mastered the methods of delving into business, and the thought of collectivism and the exertion of collective strength are insufficient. However, we have finally initially overcome the subjective and objective difficulties under the encouragement of the widespread development of the women's mass movement, the active implementation of the instructions and decisions of the All-China Women's Federation by cadres of women's federations at all levels, and the efforts of all comrades in this association, and will continue to persist in overcoming difficulties and strive forward.

(II) Several Major Tasks for This Winter and Next Spring

In order to respond to Chairman Mao's call and work with the people of the whole country to strive for a fundamental improvement in the financial and economic situation, and in order to consolidate and develop the achievements made in women's work over the past year, before our work plan for next year is determined, we will first put forward the tasks for women's work this winter and next spring as the direction of our efforts:

First, actively carry out women's work in areas implementing land reform: Women cadres in these areas must actively participate in the preparatory work for local land reform, deeply study the land reform policy and the Land Law, and be familiar with the local women's situation. When carrying out land reform, we must adhere to the principle of mobilizing both men and women together, overcome the idea of neglecting to mobilize women, and absorb peasant women to participate in peasant associations or other relevant meetings, and select activists from among women to participate in leadership work. Women's committees or commissions can be set up in peasant associations, and women's representative conferences or women's mass meetings can be convened to discuss women's participation in land reform. It is necessary to implement Article 11 of the Land Law, which stipulates that land should be uniformly distributed according to population, correctly determine the class composition of women, and effectively guarantee women's land rights. When land reform is carried out, it is necessary to promote equality between men and women, and appropriately lift the special feudal constraints suffered by women to ensure the benefits and rights that women should receive and enjoy in land reform. To this end, women cadres in various regions must actively participate in land reform work, and actively suggest to leading organs that mobilizing the masses of women in land reform should be regarded as one of the important tasks of the entire movement. At the same time, in order to gain experience and steadily advance, women cadres in various regions should conscientiously participate in the work of typical land reform experimental areas.

In areas where land reform is not implemented this winter, local women's federations should combine with suppressing bandits, eliminating local bullies, and reducing rent to carry out women's work. Publicize the significance and importance of suppressing bandits, eliminating local bullies, and reducing rent to urban and rural women, educate and mobilize peasant women to actively participate, and guarantee their due rights.

Second, organizing and educating women to participate in various industrial and agricultural production is still the central task of women's federations at all levels. Cities should strengthen the production work of female workers, family members of employees, and working women according to different situations and conditions. The method for women's federations to lead women to participate in production is mainly to cooperate with local governments, enterprises, trade unions, and cooperatives, focusing on removing ideological obstacles and practical difficulties for women to participate in production, advocating and helping them learn skills. Therefore, women's federations should actively help relevant parties organize childcare, maternal and child health, and cultural education and technical education work. And pay attention to organized education. The report on several issues concerning urban women's work at this enlarged executive committee meeting should be implemented in various regions.

In rural areas where land reform has been completed, mobilize a large number of women to participate in autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and winter sideline production, and organize them to participate in mutual aid production groups under voluntary conditions, and prepare for spring plowing next year. In the process of establishing and transforming the cooperative movement, actively mobilize women to participate in cooperatives. In areas where land reform is being implemented, attention must be paid to combining production with land reform.

Third, actively mobilize women to participate in the winter school movement and solve the difficulties that women must solve in learning. In line with the content of local winter school education, carry out special education for women (such as women's liberation, marriage law, maternal and child health and other knowledge). In particular, select district and village female cadres and female activists with potential for development to receive cultural education, and enable them to play a model leading role in learning. For middle-aged women who are burdened by family responsibilities, appropriate organizational forms and methods should be used to enable them to obtain learning opportunities. In places where there are standardized peasant spare-time schools or people's schools, a certain number of women who may persist in learning should be selected to enter the schools. To this end, the cadres in charge of women's work in districts and villages should strive to participate in the leadership work of winter school education in districts and villages, and actively coordinate to promote the work.

Fourth, continue to assist the judicial organs of governments at all levels, especially district and village governments, in implementing the marriage law. To this end, women cadres in various regions must first study and familiarize themselves with the marriage law, and carry out the propaganda and explanation of the marriage law among the masses in a planned way. Women's federations have the responsibility to put forward their own suggestions and revisions on deviations and incorrect ideas in the implementation of the marriage law. When land reform has not yet been carried out and the masses have not yet been mobilized, the masses' awareness must be taken into account when implementing the marriage law, and it should not be rushed. At present, the important thing is to publicize and explain the marriage law and prepare the conditions for gradual implementation. In the women's federations of multi-ethnic regions, we should adhere to the spirit of Article 27 of the Marriage Law, and assist the people's governments of the major administrative regions and provinces in formulating supplementary regulations suitable for local conditions under possible conditions. It must be recognized that the complete realization of the marriage law is a long-term process of effort, and we cannot be eager for quick results, but we cannot be the tail of the backward masses and delay the implementation of the marriage law.

Fifth, continue to carry out the movement to defend world peace and strengthen international propaganda and liaison work: Women's federations in various regions must cooperate closely with other mass organizations and continue to strengthen and expand the peace signature movement as much as possible by various means, truly ensuring that women account for more than one-third of the 150 million to 200 million signatures. Women's federations in various regions should also assist the All-China Women's Federation and relevant parties in planning to prepare for attending the Second World Peace Congress in a planned way. In the future, the All-China Women's Federation should strengthen its contact with the International Women's Federation and the democratic women's movements in Southeast Asian countries. Women's federations in various regions should provide materials, provide opinions, and assist in the implementation of this work in various aspects. Cadres of women's federations at all levels should study international knowledge, care about the international democratic women's movement, and widely carry out internationalist propaganda and education among the masses of women.

In order to complete the above tasks, we must strengthen the unity of women of all nationalities, all classes, all democratic parties, non-party democratic women, and all patriotic women, more universally establish women's representative conferences, truly and widely contact the masses of women, and improve cadres, learn skills, and do a good job.

　　民主妇联一年来的工作概况及今冬明春的主要工作任务
    ——在民主妇联第三次执委扩大会上的报告
    蔡畅
    （一）一年来的工作概况
    一年来，全国民主妇联的组织，有了比较广泛的发展，根据目前不完全的统计，已有四大行政区的三十一个省，八十三个市，一千二百八十七个县建立了民主妇女联合会或筹备委员会，通过各种妇女群众的组织，联系了妇女三千余万人。追述这一年的工作，是在过去原有的工作基础上前进了一步。从第二次执委会以后到十二月，主要工作是接受国际民主妇联的委托，准备并召开了亚洲妇女代表会议。一九五○年开始，制订了一九五○年的妇女运动的具体方针任务及全国妇联的工作要点，工作重点放在各地区，尽可能地有重点地加强领导各地妇联的工作，而尤其着重在了解和研究大中城市妇女工作情况及其存在的问题。为此曾经先后派本会执委、常委、副部长等分赴天津、沈阳、张家口、上海、察哈尔、河北及中南行政区，或者参加当地的妇女代表会及妇女工作会议，或者调查了解当地妇女工作情况，并举行了天津、上海、山西、绥远等地负责干部的工作汇报，经过这些工作及一般的书面报告和通讯来往，开始部分的加强了与各地妇联的联系与改进了某些工作。
    兹将这一年来的重要工作，分别报告如下：
    第一、坚持了组织妇女参加生产为中心的方针：从中国妇女第一次代表大会决定了以组织妇女参加生产为中心的方针以后，各地妇联曾经努力执行了这方针，获得了成绩，在工业生产方面，各城市妇联，配合工会，以女工工作为重点，协助工会女工部在女工中进行一些提高生产，文化教育，保育儿童妇幼卫生等工作。又努力克服困难，组织一部分贫苦劳动妇女参加手工业的生产，获得了成绩。在农业方面，各地妇联配合了当地政府，注意发动妇女参加农业生产，组织了妇女参加春耕，夏锄，夏收。在老解放区妇女参加农业生产的，一般的达百分之五十到七十，有些半老区亦达到了百分之四十，参加互助组的人数，据河北九个专区中一千五百余村的统计，参加长期及临时互助组的妇女共达三万五千余人，老解放区有些先进妇女的农业技术也比去年提高了。在灾区主要是生产与救灾结合，全国妇联三次派人赴平原、苏北等重灾区视察，指出灾区妇联应以组织妇女生产救灾为中心，纠正个别灾区妇联忽视救灾任务的偏向。
    但是在执行生产为中心的方针时，各地妇联也遇到了不少困难，由于有些干部不了解如何根据具体情况执行这方针，因而曾经引起对这方针的若干怀疑，今年本会发表的《一九五○年中国妇女运动的方针任务》，及与全国四大人民团体联合发表的《纪念“三八”国际劳动妇女节通知》均明确地坚持以妇女参加生产为中心的方针、并于春季专门发表了《为组织农村妇女完成全年农业生产任务给各级妇联的通知》。
    我们的缺点，是未能根据客观的需要，及时地发出指示，大部分还限于一般号召，未能与城乡的具体情况相结合，指出具体执行这方针的方法，因此未能切实帮助各地解决困难。其次，去年全国妇联生产部的业务范围规定的还不够明确，甚至一度有取消生产部的意见，现在虽然肯定了生产部的组织，明确规定该部的业务，但因工作重点未定，人员配备不健全，因此工作亦未能展开。
    第二、关于妇女儿童福利事业方面：我们协助了中央人民政府政务院法制委员会完成了中华人民共和国婚姻法草案，在中央人民政府正式颁布施行后，又联合了四大全国性的人民团体发表联合通知，拥护新婚姻法，通知各级人民团体广泛宣传，教育群众，协助政府，贯彻执行。全国妇联本身也从各方面利用各种方法进行了宣传教育和解释婚姻法的工作。在政协全国委员会二次会议时，提出各地妇联参加陪审婚姻案件的提案，业已通过送政府核办。
    提倡替女工、女职员举办和改进各种各样的儿童保育机构和幼稚园并开展妇幼卫生工作，如团结医务人员（特别是助产士等）宣传妇幼卫生常识、改造旧产婆试办妇幼卫生站等，以帮助一部分妇女解除在参加生产（或工作）中所遇到的抚育孩子的一些困难，以提高妇女的生产效能，增进儿童健康。特别是通过纪念“六一”国际儿童节的工作，扩大宣传了保卫儿童权利的重要性，并对今后城市、农村的儿童保育工作的方针任务及重点，均有所提议。这些意见，引起了一部分妇联干部和保育工作干部的注意，加以研究讨论，作为改进工作的依据。大部分地方妇联认真地开展儿童保育工作。现在全国各地共有各种公私立的保育机构六百四十三所，收托儿童三万一千七百九十四人，和解放前全国原有托儿所一百四十七所比较，已增加了五倍以上。另外尚有公私立儿童教养机关一百八十三所，总计教养孤儿难童二万三千七百九十人。又据十八个省的报告，已开办了保育训练班六十七期，训练了保育干部一千八百五十余人。
    第三、宣传教育工作方面：为了适应新中国建设事业的需要、针对妇女干部的思想及工作情况，我们号召她们，加强学习，提高能力。今年纪念“三八”节时，通过新华总社发表了《学会本领做好工作》的社论，要求各地妇女干部加以学习，因此在思想上都有不同程度的提高，并带动了妇女群众学习。此外，全国妇联主办的新中国妇女职业学校，第一届三百五十余学生已毕业，现正加以扩充，并以培养妇女工作及工农出身的女干部为主，兼训练女技术人员。
    一年来，我们坚持编辑和出版了新中国妇女月刊，对于妇女干部和群众都起了一定的宣传教育作用，但是在这方面还有不少缺点；特别是与实际联系不够，指导性不强，在该刊附编的工农妇女常识教材，现已有七省市翻印采用，对于推动工农妇女教育是有所帮助的。但在内容上形式上还须待改进。此外，响应了国际民主妇联的号召并执行其决议，特别是纪念“六一”国际儿童节的工作和世界和平的签名运动等，扩大了国际主义的宣传教育，现正在更加扩大加强和平签名运动，开展反对美国侵略台湾、朝鲜的宣传工作。我们工作中还有缺点，主要表现在未能深入检查及帮助各地妇联改进业务，也未能及时地系统地扩大群众中的宣传工作，因此这工作尚未赶上客观的需要。
    第四、坚持提倡建立妇女代表会议的组织：从去年中国妇女第一次全国代表大会确定了“解放区城乡地方性妇女组织，应以妇女代表会议为主要形式”以后，大部分地区妇联均先后建立了各种各样的妇女代表会议，创造了经验，证明这种组织形式既是更广泛地团结妇女群众，又是有效的推广工作的最好的组织形式。但有一些地区还有干部对于妇女代表会议的组织作用认识不足，或仍拘于过去妇联会的个人会员制的作法，或者取消了妇女代表会议的组织作用，仅仅认为是一种传达上级决定的工作方法，因而阻碍了妇女代表会议的推行。
    为此，全国妇联曾作了若干努力，先后发表了关于妇女代表会议的文章，主要是批评了在召开妇女代表会议中的关门主义形式主义的现象，解答了城乡妇女代表会议的现存的主要问题。这些意见引起一些地方妇联的重视，对推进妇女代表会议起了一定的作用，但未能适时地明确地针对各地存在的重要问题，给以更有系统地更有力的指示。
    第五、国际工作方面：全国妇联的国际宣传与联络工作，随着中国革命胜利而日益繁重，去年全国民主妇联受国际民主妇联之委托，主持筹备并召开了亚洲妇女代表会议，决定了亚洲妇运方针任务，鼓励了亚洲妇女的解放斗争；不但对亚洲妇女运动将起着重要推动作用，而且对亚洲民族解放斗争也将起一定的作用。在国内传达了亚洲妇女代表会议的决议，进行了国际主义的教育。又先后派人出席了国际民主妇联在莫斯科举行的理事会和在芬兰京城举行的第九次执委会议，以及参加庆祝匈牙利、捷克、朝鲜国庆的中国人民代表团；利用了各种可能的机会介绍中国革命胜利，中国妇女英勇斗争的情况和经验。此外并协助了东南亚某些国家的代表学习，对于我们和国际友人的团结与联系方面是有成绩有发展的，但是我们对于这种日益加重的国际任务认识不足，工作还带被动性。
    第六、本会机关工作：本会机关内部，在原有工作基础上做了进一步的整理，建立了必要的工作制度，逐渐明确了各部门的业务范围，机关工作逐渐走上正轨。各党派及无党派干部间的团结日益加强。但未能严格执行制度，经常的检查工作，各种会议准备不够；尤其对各地妇女工作的情况的了解和研究不够。
    其次，今年与全国性人民团体及有关机关建立了较多的联系，如与全国性的人民团体联合发布通知、通电、以及为完成一件工作而联合举行会议等，扩大与推动工作的影响，互相交流了工作经验。我们认为配合工作的原则，是要根据工作需要，客观地估计各方情况，有重点地主动地争取与有关方面配合，避免无准备的，偶然性的，以及不分轻重，缓急的凡事配合，到处配合，以致分散力量，使工作失去中心，陷于被动的毛病，配合的内容；应根据既定的中心工作，新增的共同性的工作，凡有利贯彻男女平等，保护妇女儿童的权益，推进妇女工作者，当有关方面被忽略时，应注意提出建议。凡有关于此者，应注意考虑并接受指定的任务。配合的方法，首先采取个别的暂时的协商，逐渐进到一定的业务和经常性的组织联系，选派相当的人员，出席应邀或争取参加有关的会议及组织。经过在各部门兼职的常委，注意争取配合。
    在进行工作中，遇到了不少困难，有来自客观方面的，是过渡时期与胜利发展中带来的困难，如妇女工作的组织与业务日益走向全国的规模，国际任务日益加重。来自主观方面的则是业务不熟，经验不够，机构不健全，必要的干部配备不全，现有干部政治思想水平还不高不齐，还存在主观与事务的作风，有些干部在钻习业务方面尚不得法，以及集体主义的思想和集体力量的发挥不够等，但是我们终于在妇女群众运动广泛开展，各级妇联干部积极贯彻全国妇联的指示和决定的鼓舞之下，和本会全体同志的努力之中，初步克服了主客观的困难，并将要继续坚持克服困难，努力前进。
    （二）今冬明春几个主要工作任务
    为着响应毛主席的号召，与全国人民一起努力争取财政经济的基本好转；为着巩固和发展一年来妇女工作已得的成绩在我们明年工作计划未定之前特先提出今冬明春妇女工作的任务，作为我们大家努力的方向：
    第一、积极开展实行土地改革地区的妇女工作：这些地区的妇联干部必须积极参加当地土地改革的准备工作，深入学习土地改革政策和土地法，熟习当地妇女情况。在进行土地改革时，要坚持贯彻男女一齐发动的方针，克服忽视发动妇女的思想，吸收农民妇女，参加农民协会或其他有关会议，选拔妇女中的积极分子参加领导工作。在农民协会中可设妇女委员或委员会，召开妇女代表会议或妇女群众大会讨论妇女参加土地改革问题。要贯彻土地法第十一条，按人口统一分配土地的原则，正确地确定妇女的阶级成份，确实有效地保障妇女土地权，在土改进行时，宣传男女平等，并能适当地解除妇女所受的特殊封建束缚以保障妇女在土地改革中应得的利益和应享的权利。为此，各地妇联干部必须积极参加土地改革工作，主动向领导机关建议，把土地改革中的发动妇女群众，当做整个运动的重要任务之一。同时，为了取得经验，稳步推进，各地妇联干部，应认真参加土地改革典型试验区的工作。
    今冬不实行土地改革的地区，当地妇联应与清匪反霸和减租相结合，开展妇女工作。向城乡妇女群众宣传清匪、反霸减租的意义和重要性，教育与发动农民妇女积极参加，并保障她们应得的权利。
    第二、组织教育妇女参加各种工业和农业生产，仍是各级妇联的中心任务。各城市应按不同情况与条件，加强女工，员工家属和劳动妇女生产的工作，妇联领导妇女参加生产的工作方法，主要是与当地政府、企业、工会、合作社配合进行，着重在解除妇女参加生产的思想障碍和实际困难，提倡和帮助她们学习技术。因此，妇联应积极的帮助有关方面举办儿童保育，妇幼卫生，和文化教育技术教育等工作。并重视组织起来的教育。对于本届执委扩大会议关于城市妇女工作的几个问题的报告，各地要贯彻执行。
    在土地改革已完成地区的农村，大量动员妇女参加秋收秋耕与冬季副业生产，在自愿的条件下组织她们参加生产互助小组，准备明年春耕。在进行建立与改造合作社运动中要积极动员妇女参加合作社。正在实行土地改革的地区，必须注意到土地改革中结合生产。
    第三、积极动员妇女参加冬学运动，解决妇女在学习中必须解决的困难。配合当地冬学教育的内容，进行妇女的特殊教育（如妇女解放、婚姻法、妇幼卫生等知识）。特别选拔有培养前途的区村女干部和女积极分子受文化教育，并使她们在学习上起模范带头作用，对于有家庭牵累的中年妇女，应用适当的组织形式和方法，使他们能获得学习的机会。在有正规化的农民业余学校或民校的地方应选择一定数量的，可能坚持学习的妇女入校。为此，区、村妇女工作负责干部，应争取参加区、村冬学教育的领导工作，主动积极地协同推进工作。
    第四、继续协助各级政府的司法机关，特别是区村政府贯彻执行婚姻法，为此，各地妇联干部首先要深入学习，熟习婚姻法，有计划地在群众中进行婚姻法的宣传解释工作，对执行婚姻法中之偏差和不正确思想，妇联有责任提出自己的建议和修正意见，当土地改革尚未进行，群众尚未发动的地区，执行婚姻法时更要估计到群众的觉悟，不可操之过急，目前重要的还是宣传解释婚姻法，准备逐渐实行的条件。在多民族地区的妇联，应坚持贯彻婚姻法第二十七条的精神，协助大行政区及省的人民政府，在可能条件下制定适合当地情况的补充规定。必须认识婚姻法的完全实现，是长期努力过程，不能急于求成，但也不能做落后群众的尾巴，拖延执行婚姻法。
    第五、继续开展保卫世界和平运动，加强国际宣传和联络工作：各地妇联必须与其他群众团体密切配合，尽可能地用各种方法继续加强和扩大和平签名运动，真正做到在一亿五千万到二亿的签名人数中，妇女能占三分之一以上，各地妇联并应协助全国妇联与各有关方面有计划的准备出席第二届世界保卫和平大会的工作。今后全国妇联应加强与国际妇联及东南亚各国民主妇女运动的联系。各地妇联应供给材料，提供意见，并从各方面协助此项工作之进行。各级妇联干部均应学习国际知识，关心国际民主妇女运动，并在妇女群众中，广泛开展国际主义的宣传教育。
    为了完成上述任务，必须加强各民族各阶层各民主党派妇女无党无派的民主妇女及一切爱国妇女的团结，更普遍地建立妇女代表会议，真正地广泛联系妇女群众，并提高干部，学习本领，做好工作。
