　　Hankou Zhengda Cloth Store Capitalists Violate the Common Program
    Restrict Employees' Political Freedom
    Force Employees to Fill Out "Voluntary Application Forms", and Engage in Illegal Exploitation
    [Our Wuhan Dispatch] The capitalists of the Zhengda Cloth Store in Wuhan violated the spirit of the Common Program and the provisions of the Trade Union Law, forcing store employees to fill out "voluntary application forms" and depriving store employees of their political and economic rights. This incident has been appropriately handled by the Wuhan Labor Bureau. In September of this year, Zhengda Cloth Store hired eleven new employees. The capitalists forced each employee to fill out a "voluntary application form," which stipulated harsh conditions that violated government laws and regulations, such as "not allowed to join any organizations" and "temporary employees are temporary in nature, hired for one month at a time; upon expiration, the store has the right to decide whether to continue employing or dismiss the employee." Due to their livelihood, the employed store employees were forced to accept these conditions. The capitalists of the store used this unreasonable contract as a weapon to further infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of the store employees. The Cloth Industry Association originally notified all cloth stores to take a holiday to celebrate National Day, but the store neither gave a holiday nor paid extra wages as required.
    The Wuhan Labor Bureau and the store employee union discovered this illegal behavior of the Zhengda Cloth Store capitalists at the end of September. The Labor Bureau immediately educated the store capitalists multiple times, but the store capitalists refused to admit their mistake and continued to force employees to submit "voluntary application forms" on October 3rd. In order to correct the mistakes of the Zhengda Cloth Store capitalists, the Labor Bureau convened a meeting between the labor and capital sides of the store on October 13th and invited representatives from relevant departments to participate. At the meeting, the store capitalists still used the excuse of not understanding government policies and regulations, and said that the workers filled out the "voluntary application forms" "voluntarily." After the store employee union representative Yu Lian severely refuted this, the store employee representative Huang Shaojie also stated that he had accepted the conditions of the "voluntary application form" at the time because he was forced by life and had no other choice. The Cloth Industry Association representative Zhang Yuhuang and the Federation of Industry and Commerce representative Yu Zhichen also unanimously pointed out that the Zhengda capitalist's behavior was illegal. Zhang Bin, director of the Labor Bureau's secretariat, based on the opinions of all parties, pointed out the mistakes of the Zhengda capitalists and put forward opinions on how to handle the matter: (1) The clause in the voluntary application form "not allowed to join any organizations" should be immediately cancelled, and a public self-criticism of the error of this illegal behavior should be published in the newspaper. (2) Other aspects of the agreement should be re-amended and negotiated by representatives elected by the labor and capital sides, using democratic, equal, voluntary, and mutually beneficial spirit, in accordance with the Common Program, the Trade Union Law, and the collective labor contract of the cloth industry. Both parties should strictly abide by the agreement after negotiation. (3) The capitalists shall not use this as an excuse to dismiss employees or use introducers and guarantors to threaten employees. (4) Wages and overtime pay should be paid for the National Day holiday that was not given. The store employee union representative expressed agreement with the Labor Bureau's handling opinions. The Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Cloth Industry Association also expressed satisfaction with the government's handling methods. The capitalist representative Xiong Shuqing also admitted his mistakes and was willing to accept the government's lenient treatment. It was also decided at the meeting that representatives from the store employee union and the Cloth Industry Association would be sent to help the Zhengda Cloth Store labor and capital sides negotiate, so as to quickly establish a new and normal labor-capital relationship.

　　汉口正大布店资方违背共同纲领
    限制员工政治自由
    强迫填写入店“自愿书”，进行非法剥削
    【本报武汉讯】武汉市正大布店资方违背共同纲领的精神和工会法的规定，强迫店员填写入店“自愿书”，剥夺店员工人政治与经济权益，这事件，业经武汉市劳动局适当处理。正大布店于今年九月增雇店员十一人，资方强迫每个店员填写入店“自愿书”，其中竟规定“不准参加任何团体”，“临时店员系临时性质，雇用以一个月为一期，届期店员继续留用或解雇，皆由店方决定执行”等违反政府法令的苛刻条件。受雇店员因生活关系，被迫接受了这些条件。该店资方以这种不合理的契约为武器，进一步侵犯店员的合法权益。布业同业公会原通知各布店在国庆日放假庆祝，该店既不放假，也不按规定增发工资。
    经武汉市劳动局及店员工会于九月底发觉了正大布店资方这种非法行为，劳动局立即多次对该店资方进行教育，但该店资方不肯承认错误，十月三日仍逼迫店员填缴“自愿书”。劳动局为纠正正大布店资方的错误，于十月十三日召集该店劳资双方开会，并邀有关部门代表参加。会上，该店资方仍借口不懂政府政策法令，并说工人填具“自愿书”是店员工人“自愿”。经店员工会代表于连和严正驳斥后，该店店员代表黄绍杰也表示当时接受“自愿书”的条件，系迫于生活，不得不这样作；布业公会代表张玉璜、工商联代表余智琛也一致指出正大资方这种行为是违法的。劳动局秘书主任张彬根据各方意见，指出正大资方的错误，并提出处理此事的意见：（一）自愿书中“不许参加任何团体”一条，应立即取消，并在报纸上公开检讨这种违法行为的错误。（二）协约中其他方面的问题，由劳资双方各推选代表，用协商方法，以民主、平等、自愿、两利的精神，根据共同纲领、工会法及布匹业劳资集体合同，重新修改与商定，协商后双方严格遵守。（三）资方不得借此解雇店员或利用介绍人与保证人威胁店员。（四）国庆节不放假应补发工资和加工工资。店员工会代表表示同意劳动局的处理意见，工商联与绸布业同业工会对政府的处理办法也表示满意，资方代表熊树清也承认了本身的错误，并愿意接受政府的宽大处理。会上并决定由店员工会和绸布业同业工会派出代表，帮助正大布店劳资双方进行协商，以便迅速建立新的正常的劳资关系。（咏、洪世昌）
