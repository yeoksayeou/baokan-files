　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd: *Pravda* published an editorial on the 20th entitled "The Will of the Soviet People," commenting on the success of the Second All-Soviet Congress in Defense of Peace. It stated that this congress vividly demonstrated the Soviet people's unanimous support for the Soviet government's peaceful foreign policy and their readiness to fight resolutely, together with peace advocates around the world, to eliminate the threat of war and safeguard lasting peace.

　　The editorial continued: The Soviet people and progressive humanity worldwide warmly support the work of the All-Soviet Congress in Defense of Peace and the Congress's decision to suggest that the Second World Congress in Defense of Peace compile a list of war mongers. Exposing and denouncing this small group of people clamoring for war is the common demand of ordinary people in the Soviet Union and all countries around the world. The Second All-Soviet Congress in Defense of Peace has called on all peace advocates to tirelessly expand and strengthen the movement to defend peace, and to crush the conspiracies of the war mongers with powerful united action. This call will surely receive a warm response from honest people in all countries.

　　The editorial concluded: The Soviet people's determination and resolution to fight for peace are inspiring all peace advocates to unite closely around the great standard-bearer of peace, Comrade Stalin, and to advance with full confidence towards the road of defeating the imperialist aggressors.
