　　Changchun City Trust Company Rural Service Department
    Prepares to Promote Large Quantities of Winter Supplies to Meet the Seasonal Needs of Farmers in Various Regions
    [This newspaper Changchun News] After successfully completing the work plan for supplying autumn harvest farm tools in September, the Rural Service Department of Changchun Trust Company is actively promoting rural winter supplies to meet the seasonal needs of farmers. In September, the department's agency purchase and sales transaction amount reached 3.26 billion yuan (Northeast currency, same below), promoting more than 70 kinds of commodities, an increase of more than three times the transaction amount in August. It played a certain role in supplying farmers' needs and coordinating autumn harvest work. The reasons for the achievements are: primarily, close contact with cooperatives and the adoption of a mobile sales approach. In September, following the rural sales survey team, it first sent special personnel to Shuangliao, Changling, Kaitong, Taonan, and Tao'an counties to promote sales, which was very effective, with transaction volume reaching 1 billion yuan. During the promotion, farm tool price lists were issued every ten days, introducing the production and sales situation of farm tools in Changchun City. As a result, cooperatives from various regions came to Changchun to purchase farm tools. Secondly, it conducted in-depth leadership and specific investigations of private enterprises, publicizing and explaining price policies, enabling them to realize the favorable conditions for opening up the rural market. For example, the wholesale price of iron pots from the Gongmin Iron Factory was 12,000 yuan each; while the Trust Company promoted them for 11,500 yuan. The forks from Guangjuyong were 33,000 yuan, while the Trust Company promoted them for 30,000 yuan. Therefore, factories that entrusted the Trust Company with sales all achieved development in their business. It also helped cooperatives to sign order contracts with various factories. Because it was serious in checking quality and familiar with market conditions, the pricing of each item could be done reasonably. For example, on September 20, it ordered 70 flower-spoked carts for the Baiquan County General Cooperative. Initially, the cart workshop thought "who would do it if they didn't sell it for a bit more," asking for 11.5 million yuan per cart (exceeding the market price). After investigation and research, patient persuasion and education, and helping the carpenter shop calculate costs, the price was set at 9.5 million yuan per cart based on the principle of taking both public and private interests into account. This not only helped the cooperative solve the difficulties in procurement but also opened up sales channels for the factory's products. Therefore, cooperatives in various regions are willing to have dealings with the department. In September, the company purchased 72 flower-spoked carts, 15 rice threshers, 140 corn threshers, 2 chaff cutters, and a large number of bamboo brooms, wooden forks, winnowing fans, large vats, sickles, mattocks, iron rakes, buckets, iron shovels, hemp ropes, etc. for 20 county and district cooperatives including Dunhua, Changling, Baiquan, Dehui, Shuangliao, Kaitong, Taonan, Dalai, Huadian and other units such as the Jilin Provincial Agricultural Machinery Farm, Zhalantun Farm, Yingchengzi Coal Mine, Changchun Railway Bureau Material Yard, and Jilin Provincial Construction Committee, solving the needs of various units and thus connecting urban and rural relations; at the same time, it also established sales relationships with the Shuangliao County General Cooperative and the Jiaohe County General Cooperative, solved the urgent needs of the Jilin Provincial Construction Committee, found sales channels for rural sideline products, and stimulated the enthusiasm of farmers for sideline production. However, there are still some shortcomings in the work, such as in receiving goods, due to sloppy work, unqualified products were not checked out. It was not until the final inspection that it was discovered that only 850 out of 4,000 iron spoons were qualified, resulting in a great loss. The department has now established sales relationships with the felt-making industry and leather industry associations in Taonan, a special leather and specialty product area, and the industry associations in Changchun City, and has prepared a large number of winter supplies, such as: felt hat linings, felt socks, felt pieces, wula boots, cotton, fire basins, stove bars, stove doors, horse equipment, etc., scheduled to promote these items through cooperatives to meet the needs of farmers.

　　长春市信托公司农村服务部
    配合各地农民换季需要准备推销大批冬季用品
    【本报长春讯】长春信托公司农村服务部，胜利完成了九月份供应秋收农具的工作计划后，配合农民换季需要，正积极推销农村冬季用品。该部九月份中代购代销交易金额达三十二亿六千万元（东北币，下同），推销商品七十多种，比八月份交易金额增加三倍以上。在供应农民需要及配合秋收工作上，起了一定的作用。获得成绩的原因：主要是密切地联系了合作社，采取了巡回推销的方式。在九月份，随农村推销调查小组之后，即首先派专人到双辽、长岭、开通、洮南及洮安等县进行推销，收效很大，交易数达十亿元。在推销中，每隔十天发一次农具价格表，介绍长春市农具产销情况，因此各地合作社纷纷到长市购买农具。其次是对私营企业进行了深入领导及具体调查，宣传解释物价政策，使他们认识到开辟农村市场的有利条件。如公民铁工厂的铁锅，每个批发价一万二千元；而信托公司推销是一万一千五百元，广聚永的叉子是三万三千元，信托公司推销是三万元。因此凡委托信托公司代销的工厂，在业务上都获得了发展。并帮助合作社向各工厂订立订货合同，因其在检查质量上认真而且熟悉市场情况，致各物定价能够做到合理。如在九月二十日给拜泉县总社订购了七十台花轱轳车，在起初时，大车铺认为“不多卖点谁干”，每台要一千一百五十万元（超过市价）。经过调查研究，耐心说服教育并帮助木匠铺计算成本，然后根据公私兼顾原则，确定每台价格为九百五十万元。这样不但帮助合作社解决了采购上的困难，而且给工厂的产品开辟了销路。因此，各地合作社都愿意和该部有来往。九月份，该公司给敦化、长岭、拜泉、德惠、双辽、开通、洮南、大赉、桦甸等二十个县区社及吉林省机械农场、扎兰屯农场、营城子煤矿、长春铁路局材料场、吉林省修建委员会等单位，代购了花轱轳车七十二台，打稻机十五台，苞米脱粒机一百四十台，铡草机二台及大批竹扫帚、木叉子、扬场铣、大缸、镰刀、洋镐、铁扒子、水桶、铁锹、麻绳等，解决了各单位的需要，从而沟通了城乡关系；同时又曾与双辽县总社、蛟河县总社建立代销关系，解决了吉林省修建委员会的紧急需要，给农村副产找到了销路，刺激了农民的副业生产情绪。但在工作中也还存在若干缺点，如在收货时，曾因工作马虎，对不合规格的产品也没检查出来，直到最后检查时才发现有四千个铁勺子中仅有八百五十个合格者，致造成很大的损失。现该部已与皮革特产区洮南的毡制业、皮革业同业公会及长市的同业公会建立了代销关系，并准备了大批的冬季用品，如：毡帽头、毡袜、毡片、靰鞡、棉花、火盆、炉条、炉门、马具等物预定通过合作社推销这些物品，以满足农民的需要。              （冯兰）
