Zhangjiakou News: The rectification work of major state-owned factories and enterprises in Zhangjiakou (Machine and Electrical Plant, Transportation Company, Electricity Bureau, Telecommunications Bureau, Postal Bureau, Alcohol Factory, Cigarette Factory, Vegetable Oil Factory, Rubber Factory, Dahua Printing Factory, Water Company, People's Construction Company, Inner Mongolia Leather Factory, Xinsheng Flour Mill, etc., a total of 14 units) began on July 25th and ended on September 20th, lasting 57 days.

Combining Document Study with Work Inspection

In terms of rectification steps, the first ten days were devoted to studying Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, the report on rectifying the three work styles, and carrying out deliberation and preparation, which solved the problems of understanding, attitude, and methods of carrying out rectification, and clarified the direction and focus of the rectification. From August 6th to 20th, according to the actual situation of each unit, they studied the People's Daily editorial "Overcoming Serious Waste in Industrial Production" and inspected management work. From August 21st to September 7th, they studied the Trade Union Law and inspected the implementation of democratic management policies and the construction of grassroots organizations of the Party, government, and trade union. From September 8th to 20th, they inspected and resolved factory unity issues, with the main study materials being the Northeast Bureau of the CCP's "Instructions on Further Uniting Technical Personnel and Staff in Public Enterprises" and Mayor Sun Jingwen's report on factory unity issues.

Rectification Methods

In terms of rectification methods, before each study phase, rectification cadres from each factory were convened to make special reports, and the focus and requirements of the inspection were pointed out. In each factory, leading cadres first made central speeches summarizing the work, and then each study group read the documents and conducted in-depth inspections in connection with their own work. The inspection method adopted was to summarize work and solve the most important current problems. First, the facts and materials were presented, and the problems were analyzed, without simply pursuing responsibility and avoiding personnel disputes that would affect unity. After all the problems were exposed, the causes of the problems were analyzed, improvement methods were studied, and finally, a summary was made. The entire process started from the inspection of overall leadership and proceeded to departmental work and individuals.

Three Major Problems Discovered After Rectification

When inspecting management work, the main problem found was waste. The main reasons for the waste were a lack of quota management, a lack of planning and a system of designated responsibility, and an unsound inspection system. For example, the Cigarette Factory wasted 1.64 million jin of millet in broken tobacco leaves, wrapping paper, and other six items alone from August of last year to August of this year. The waste caused by the failure to accept workers' reasonable suggestions in a timely manner and the excessively low work efficiency was also significant.

There were also many problems with the factory's democratic management work. The main issue was that the factory administration's ideology of relying on the working class was not clear enough, they did not understand the role of the trade union, and there were phenomena of taking everything into one's own hands. The administration did not know how to use the trade union as a powerful assistant. The Party branch in some factories abandoned its principled leadership over the trade union, and some factories abandoned the trade union and directly engaged in production campaigns. There were phenomena of disunity between new and old cadres within some trade unions; some key cadres and a small number of activists had simple work methods and took over the trade union's work, resulting in commandism and alienating the trade union from the masses. Due to the above reasons, the democratic management work in many factories could not be sound for a long time. Because the factory management committee was not sound, and the factory administration, the Party, the trade union, and the Youth League and other organizational structures were not correctly utilized, many factories created many temporary organizational structures, resulting in overlapping organizations, multiple concurrent positions, and many meetings. For example, the Cigarette Factory had as many as 29 kinds of committees. Many committees not only became a formality but also seriously hindered the establishment and improvement of the factory management committee, the trade union, and the administrative and Party organizational structures and the full发挥 of their efficiency.

In response to the problems found in the above inspection, it was decided that quota management should be the central work of each factory's management in the future, to strengthen planning, establish a system of designated responsibility and inspection, and to struggle for implementing anti-waste and reducing costs.

Several Experiences

The following experiences were gained in the rectification of factories in Zhangjiakou City:

(1) Clarifying the direction and focus of rectification is one of the reasons for the success of this rectification. The three issues that this rectification focused on inspecting were the basic issues that played a decisive role in the factory. Because it was carefully considered in advance, the thinking was clear, and the focus was tightly grasped during the process, generally avoiding detours. Specific requirements were also put forward to each factory in light of its specific circumstances, and the most central link was grasped, such as the Telecommunications Bureau focusing on democratic management and the Cigarette Factory focusing on unity issues.

(2) In view of the characteristics of new cadres and non-Party intellectuals, conducting full ideological preparation in advance had a decisive impact on the outcome of the rectification. At the beginning, Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and the report on rectifying the three work styles were studied, pointing out that the main purpose of this rectification was to inspect work, summarize experience, eliminate concerns about rectifying history and losing one's job, eliminate the idea that rectification was a matter for veteran cadres, and correct the attitude towards rectification. Further grasp the method of inspecting work must be linked to reality and correctly use criticism and self-criticism. The anti-waste inspection followed these steps, so it was done the best. Conversely, the study and inspection of the Trade Union Law was less effective due to insufficient preparation.

(3) The combination of Party members and non-Party members, with Party members leading non-Party members, mobilizing non-Party cadres, and cultivating non-Party backbones, so that all Party and non-Party cadres were put into the rectification upsurge, was done better in the Machine and Electrical Plant and the Telecommunications Bureau.

(4) Leading cadres should take the initiative to inspect first and lead others. At the same time, the inspection of leaders should be combined with the employee representative conference (such as the Machine and Electrical Plant) and the employee meeting (such as the Water Company). At the employee representative conference of the Machine and Electrical Plant, employees put forward more than 400 opinions, which played a role in inspecting and improving leadership.

(5) The rectification time of the factory should not be too long, otherwise it will affect production and easily become tired and slack. This rectification had the phenomenon of being tense at the beginning and distracted at the end, and individual units even acted rashly. At the same time, the leadership of the smaller units was looser, and the results were smaller, which was the main shortcoming in the rectification.

　　张家口国营工厂整风结束
    集中精力解决工厂主要问题
    【张家口讯】察哈尔日报消息：张家口国营主要工厂企业（机电厂、运输公司、电业局、电信局、邮政局、酒精厂、纸烟厂、植物油厂、橡胶厂、大华印刷厂、自来水公司、人民建设公司、内蒙制革厂、欣生面粉厂等十四单位）的整风工作，从七月二十五日开始；至九月二十日结束，共历时五十七天。
  学习文件与检查工作相结合
    在整风步骤上，前十天学习毛主席在三中全会上的报告、整顿三风报告，并进行酝酿准备，解决了对整风的认识、态度和开展方法问题，明确了整风的方针和重点。八月六日至二十日，根据本单位的实际情况学习人民日报“克服工业生产中的严重浪费”社论，检查经营管理工作。八月二十一日至九月七日学习工会法，检查民主管理政策的执行及党、政、工的基层组织建设。九月八日至二十日检查与解决工厂团结问题，学习材料以中共东北局“关于进一步团结公营企业中技术人员与职员的指示”及孙敬文市长关于工厂团结问题的报告为主。
    整风的方法
    在整风方法上，在每一学习阶段之前，召集各厂整风干部作专题报告，并指出检查的重点和要求。各厂由领导干部首先做检查工作的中心发言，然后由各学习组阅读文件，联系本身工作进行深入检查。检查方法采取总结工作，解决当前最重大问题。先是摆事实、摆材料，分析问题，不单纯追究责任，避免影响团结的人事纷争，待问题全部暴露后，再分析发生问题的原因，研究改进办法，最后做总结。全部过程是由检查总的领导开始，到部门工作和个人。
  经过整风发现三个主要问题
    检查经营管理工作时，发现主要的问题是浪费。造成浪费的主要原因是缺乏定额管理，缺乏计划和专责制，检查制度不健全。例如纸烟厂自去年八月至今年八月，仅碎烟叶、盘纸等六项浪费即达一百六十四万斤小米。因未及时接受工人合理化建议，工作效率太低等所造成的浪费也很大。
    工厂民主管理工作存在的问题也很多。主要的是工厂行政上依靠工人阶级的思想不够明确，不了解工会的作用，有包办现象。行政上不知运用工会这一有力的助手。有些厂的党支部对工会放弃原则领导，有的厂抛开工会直接去搞生产运动。某些工会内部存在着新老干部不团结的现象；有些主要干部和少数积极分子工作方法简单，包办工会工作，结果产生命令主义，使工会脱离了群众。由于以上原因，使不少工厂的民主管理工作长期不能健全。由于工厂管理委员会不健全，又没有正确的发挥工厂行政、党、工会和青年团等组织机构的作用，许多厂便产生了很多临时性的组织机构，造成组织重叠，兼职多，会议多的现象。如纸烟厂各种委员会有二十九种之多。许多委员会不仅流于形式并且严重妨碍了工厂管理委员会、工会及行政、党的组织机构的建立、健全和其效率的充分发挥。
    针对以上检查出的问题，决定今后以定额管理为各厂经营管理的中心工作，加强计划，树立专责制与检查制，为贯彻反浪费，降低成本而斗争。
    几点经验
    张市各工厂整风中获得如下经验：
    （一）明确整风方针和重点是此次整风获得成绩的原因之一。这次整风着重检查的三个问题是工厂中起决定作用的基本问题。因事先考虑成熟，思想明确，进行中紧紧掌握了重点，一般的没有走弯路。对各厂也是结合具体情况，提出具体要求，抓紧最中心的一环，如电信局着重民主管理，纸烟厂着重团结问题。
    （二）针对新干部及非党知识分子的特点，事先进行充分的思想酝酿，对整风的结果有决定影响。开始学习毛主席在三中全会上报告及整顿三风报告，指出此次整风主要是检查工作总结经验，解除怕整历史、怕整掉饭碗等顾虑，消除认为整风是老干部的事的想法，端正了整风态度。进一步掌握检查工作必须联系实际和正确运用批评与自我批评的方法。反浪费的检查是按这些步骤的，所以做得最好。相反地，工会法的学习与检查，由于酝酿不够，收效较小。
    （三）党内外相互结合，由党内带动党外，把非党干部动员起来，培养非党骨干，使党与非党干部全部投入整风热潮，这一方面以机电厂、电信局做得较好。
    （四）领导干部应首先主动检查，带动其他。同时检查领导要与职工代表会议（如机电厂）及职工大会（如自来水公司）结合起来。机电厂职工代表会议上，职工提出四百多件意见，起到检查领导、改进领导的作用。
    （五）工厂整风时间不可拖得太长，不然会影响生产，也易疲塌松懈。这次整风便有开始紧张，末期精力分散的现象，个别单位甚至有草率从事的。同时对各小单位的领导较松，收效也小，这是整风中的主要缺点。
