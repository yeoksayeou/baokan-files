　　Our Supreme Duty
    Amado
    The judging session of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Partisans for Peace held in Prague in August further demonstrated the power and invincible strength of the peace and democracy camp. This meeting was convened specifically to deal with the issue of selecting competition entries for the prizes of the Paris World Congress of Partisans for Peace, which were awarded to artistic works, literature, and films serving the people. Just listing the works and participants is enough to prove that this is the best and healthiest part of world culture created by the working people and all ethnic groups fighting for their cause (which is also the cause of mankind; the cause of peace and human happiness).
    Indeed, we live in an era where no honest writer or artist with genuine creative talent can remain indifferent to the fierce struggle between the forces of peace and the despicable representatives of the plutocracy (who are once again trying to drag the people into a more terrifying massacre). Noticing this danger that threatens humanity and culture, all ethnic groups are posing a question to writers and artists, a question that each of us (regardless of political views, religion, and philosophical beliefs) must answer:
    "Who are you for? Are you for those who want to destroy human culture and plunge humanity into the war hell of world destruction, or are you for the common people of all countries (who are in fact the living source of culture, and who are trying to prevent the greatest crime in human history)?"
    "This question cannot go unanswered. The Stockholm Appeal demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons poses this question to all writers and artists. Signing or not signing means either standing on the side of peace, culture, and life, or becoming an accomplice to the crimes of the atomic maniacs who spread death—the enemies of human culture."
    I do not believe that any writer or artist would refuse to sign the Stockholm Appeal. Refusal to sign would only mean that the writer or artist is not qualified. How can a person who approves of the atomic bomb, which is directly opposed to life and beauty, depict life and beauty? To such people, we, writers and artists, must say: "You do not belong among us. You are not a writer or artist, because you are against what we cultural creators consider most important: you are against human love and the future of humanity."
    However, it is not enough to simply sign the Stockholm Appeal. The creation of writers and artists cannot be separated from time and space. On the contrary, the current and future vitality of their works is deeply and directly rooted in the era in which they are produced. Therefore, the candidates for the literary prize established by the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Partisans for Peace include Blok and Fucik, who were killed by the Nazis during the war. These names are loved by all people. The works of these writers are immortal. These works will forever inspire and encourage mankind, precisely because these works were created for their tragic era, for the nations at war, and for progress. They were also created for humanity. This is why these two Peace Prize candidates are called models for writers and artists.
    For our pens, typewriters, brushes, chisels, or our film cameras, the most moving and beautiful theme is the struggle of all ethnic groups for peace. This is a major issue of our time, the basic task of the people today, and an unavoidable theme for all who are willing to speak for humanity, all writers, and artists.
    Fighting for peace is the most urgent theme today; can anyone still write about things that are irrelevant to this? When I looked at the flowers this summer, I thought of the danger that threatens these flowers, trees, mountains, and rivers; the war provocateurs have spread a layer of atomic weapon terror over the joyful nature. When I saw a young couple whispering sweet nothings to each other on a summer evening, I thought that love had been shrouded in the shadow of death; we must protect engaged people, husbands, and wives. When I heard the soft voices of playing children with a throbbing heart, I felt even more that in our time, our literary works can have no other theme than to fight for peace: to defend everything, to defend the beauty of the world and the joy of life. The theme of fighting for peace emanates from everything because it is closely connected with everything; it is the pivot of all other themes, because today, when American imperialism has wantonly invaded the Korean people, the victory of peace is the most important. We must fulfill our responsibility: to make our works serve peace. This is an inescapable and urgent responsibility.
    The judges gathered in Prague—a city that is itself a work of art—demonstrated the growing awareness of this responsibility among writers and artists, and indeed this awareness is growing among the most famous and beloved literary writers. Just looking at the list of candidates is enough to prove this: such as painters Picasso, Guttuso, Pignon, Ilny, and Kent; filmmakers Jakubowska, Daquin, and Vávra; world-renowned writers Aldridge, Vittorini, Delda, Neruda, Kruczkowski, Sadoveanu, Pumanova, and Kahn. These are just a few names that I have randomly listed from a very incomplete list.
    The front of peace and progress is growing in number and quality every day due to the participation of cultural workers. And it should be so, because in the other camp, only death and misfortune can attract poets and musicians, novelists and artists, painters and sculptors. The Nobel Prize for decadent bourgeois literature was not awarded to anyone last year because there were no suitable candidates.
    The prizes of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Partisans for Peace are now the most coveted honors for those who write, paint, sculpt, compose, or make films. They are prizes awarded by the representatives of all ethnic groups. They are immortal honors, and there is nothing nobler or more glorious in history. The works sent to the judges for review show that most writers and artists are aware of the danger of war; aware of the need to fight for peace. In this struggle, their works are a powerful weapon, a weapon used by the people against hunger, oppression, and death.

　　我们的无上职责
    阿马多
    世界拥护和平大会常设委员会于八月在布拉格举行的评判会，进一步证明了和平民主阵营的威力及其不可战胜的力量。这次会议是专为处理挑选参加巴黎世界拥护和平大会所设奖金的竞选作品问题而召开的，奖金是授与那些为人民服务的艺术作品，文学和电影的。仅列举一下作品和参加竞选的人就足以证实这是劳动人民与为他们的事业（也是人类的事业；和平及人类幸福的事业）而斗争的各族人民所创造的世界文化中的最好而且最健康的东西。
    的确，我们是生活在这样一个时代，没有一个具有真正创作天才的正直作家或艺术家能够再对和平势力与可鄙的财阀代表（他们正再度努力把人民卷入到更加可怖的屠杀中）之间的剧烈斗争，漠不关心。各族人民注意到这种威胁人类和文化的危险，正在向作家们和艺术家们提出一个问题，我们每个人（不分政见、宗教与哲学信仰）都必须予以回答的问题：
    “你为着谁？是为那些想摧毁人类文化、把人类投入毁灭世界的战争地狱的人们，还是为各国的平民（事实上他们正是文化的有生源泉，而力图阻止人类史上的最大的罪行的也正是他们）呢？
    “这个问题不能够不给以回答。要求禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言向所有作家和艺术家提出了这个问题。签不签名就是说或者站到和平、文化与生活的这一边来，或者成为散布死亡的原子狂们——人类文化的敌人——的罪行的同谋犯。”
    我不相信有哪个作家或艺术家会拒绝在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名。拒绝签名只会意味着这个作家或艺术家的不够格。一个人如果赞成与生活和美直接作对的原子弹，那么他如何能描绘生活与美呢？对于这样的人，我们，作家和艺术家们必须说：“你不是属于我们中间的。你不是一个作家或艺术家，因为你反对我们文化创造者们所认为最重要的东西：你反对人类的爱和人类的将来。”
    但是，仅在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名是不够的。作家与艺术家的创作是不能与时间和空间分开的。相反的，他们作品在目前以及将来的活力都是深深而直接地植根于它们所产生的时代。因此，世界拥护和平大会常设委员会所设立的文学奖金候选人中，包括有在战时被纳粹杀害的布洛克与伏契克。这些名字为一切人民所爱戴。这些作家的作品是不朽的。这些作品将永远地激励和鼓舞人类，就是因为这些作品是为着它们的悲惨时代，为着在战争中的国家以及为着进步而创作的。它们也是为着人类而创作的。这两位和平奖金候选人被称为作家与艺术家的模范，其原因也就在这里。
    对我们的钢笔、打字机、画笔、雕刻刀或我们的电影机来说，一个最动人的最美的主题，就是各族人民为争取和平的斗争。这是当代的一个大问题，目前人民的基本任务，一切愿意为人类说话的人们、一切作家与艺术工作者的义不容辞的主题。
    为和平而斗争是今天最迫切的主题，难道有谁还能写些与此无关的事物么？今年夏天当我注视花朵的时候，我想到有种危险，在威胁着这些花朵、树木、山岭与河流；战争挑拨者已在欢欣的大自然上布下一层原子武器的恐怖。夏日的晚上当我看到一对年青的爱侣柔声细语相互倾吐爱情的时候，于是我想着爱情已经罩上死亡的阴影；我们必须保护订了婚的人们、丈夫和妻子。当我带着跳动的心听到嬉戏的孩子们的软语时，我于是更加觉得在我们这个时代，我们的文学著作除了为和平而斗争：保卫一切、保卫世界上的美与生活的欢乐，之外再不能有其他的主题。为和平而斗争的主题是发自一切，因为它与一切都有密切的连系；它是其他一切主题的枢纽，因为今天，在美帝国主义已经恣意侵略朝鲜人民的时候，和平的胜利是最重要的。我们要执行我们的责任：使我们的作品为和平而服务。这是一个无可逃避的紧迫的责任。
    聚集在布拉格——这座城市其本身就是一件艺术品——的评判人，证明在作家与艺术工作者中间对这种责任的觉悟日益增长，而且事实上这种觉悟也正在最著名和最受人爱戴的文艺作家们中间增长着。看一下竞选者的名单就足以证明这一点了：如像毕卡索、葛吐卓、波丁纳利、伊尔尼与肯特等画家；雅库鲍夫斯卡、达金、瓦弗拉等电影工作者；阿尔德里琪、维托里尼、德尔达、聂鲁达、克鲁茨科夫斯基、沙杜维亚努、普马诺瓦、康恩等世界闻名的作家。这只是我从很不完全的名单上随意列举的几个名字。
    和平与进步阵线，由于文化工作者的参加，在数量上与质量上每日都在壮大。而且理应如此，因为在另外一个阵营里，只有死亡与不幸才能够吸引诗人与音乐家，小说家与艺术家，画家与雕刻家。为着颓废的资产阶级文学而设的诺贝尔奖金，在去年没有发给任何一个人，因为没有任何适当的竞选者。
    世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的奖金，现在是那些写作、绘画、雕塑、作曲或制电影片的人们所最羡慕的荣誉。它们是代表各族人民所授与的奖金。它们是不朽的荣誉，在历史上没有比这更高贵或更光荣的。送给评判人审查的作品显示大多数的作家和艺术家都觉察到战争的危险；觉察到必须为和平而斗争。在这个斗争中，他们的作品是一种有力的武器，人民用来反饥饿、压迫与死亡的武器。
