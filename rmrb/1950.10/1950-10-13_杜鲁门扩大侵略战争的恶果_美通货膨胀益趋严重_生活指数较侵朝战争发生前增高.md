Xinhua News Agency, 12th: Inflation, one of the characteristics of the post-war economic development of the United States, has become increasingly serious since the Truman administration launched the war of aggression against Korea and promoted the plan to expand the war. According to statistics published by the US Department of Labor's Bureau of Statistics, the wholesale price index of basic commodities rose nearly 25% in just over two months after the outbreak of the Korean War, from 264 on June 23 to 326.3 for the week ending September 9. Although this increase will take a period of time to be reflected in the cost of living index, by August 15, the cost of living index had already increased by three points compared to before the Korean War (170.2 based on the 1935-1939 average in mid-June). The increase in points was five times the increase for the entire year up to June. According to Dun & Bradstreet statistics, food, the main consumption item for the people, was 15.7% higher on September 1 this year than a year ago. Of this, 12.5% rose in the last eleven weeks alone, so most of the rise occurred after the outbreak of the Korean War.

Faced with this drastic inflation, even responsible officials in the US government cannot hide it recently. McCabe, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, admitted: "Inflation is not just around the corner, it is already here." The US Information Service pointed out worriedly on the 10th that this "gloomy picture of inflation" is "becoming more and more bleak" due to government military orders worth tens of billions of dollars.

The increasingly serious inflation has made the lives of working people even more degraded. At present, the movement to demand wage increases in American industry is rapidly expanding. Following the recent demands for wage increases by workers in the aluminum, electrical, and automobile industries, millions of workers in the steel, railway, machinery, shoe, and telephone industries are also negotiating wage increases and brewing strikes.

　　杜鲁门扩大侵略战争的恶果
    美通货膨胀益趋严重
    生活指数较侵朝战争发生前增高
    【新华社十二日讯】成为美国战后经济发展的特征之一的通货膨胀，自从杜鲁门政府发动侵朝战争并推进扩大战争计划以来，益趋严重。据美国劳工部统计局所发表的数字，基本商品的批发价格指数，自朝鲜战争爆发后，两个多月内连续上升了约近百分之二十五，自六月二十三日的二六四升到九月九日为止一周的三二六·三。虽然这一上涨需要一个时期才反映于生活指数，但到八月十五日，生活费指数已较朝鲜战争发生前提高三点（六月中为一九三五——一九三九平均基数的一七○·二）。增加的点数为到六月止一年全年增加数的五倍。成为人民主要消费项目的食物，据邓·希列德斯特里统计，今年九月一日较一年前高百分之十五点七。其中仅在最后十一周中就上升了百分之十二点五，因此，极大部分为朝鲜战争爆发后的升涨。
    对于这种剧烈的通货膨胀，最近连美国政府负责官员也无法掩饰。美国联邦储备局局长麦盖比承认：“通货膨胀并不是近在咫尺，而是已经在这里了”。美国新闻处十日忧虑地指出，这种“阴暗的通货膨胀景象”，因政府成数十亿美元的军事定货而“益发暗淡”。
    日益严重的通货膨胀，已使劳动人民的生活更趋下降。目前，美国工业中要求增加工资的运动，正迅速扩大。继新近铝、电气、汽车等业工人提出增加工资要求之后，钢铁、铁路、机器、制鞋、电话等业数百万工人，也正在谈判增加工资和酝酿罢工。
