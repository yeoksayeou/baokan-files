    Commemorating the 27th Anniversary of the Founding of "China Youth"
    Ren Bishi
    "China Youth" has been in publication for twenty-seven years now. Here, we cannot help but recall the fighting spirit of "China Youth," the organ of the Chinese Communist Youth League, during the Northern Expedition. At that time, Comrade Yun Daiying, an excellent Chinese Communist Party member and revolutionary martyr of the Chinese people, was the editor-in-chief of this publication. This publication disseminated Marxism-Leninism and organized young people to actively participate in the struggle against imperialism and feudalism, playing a significant role in the Chinese people's revolutionary movement. "China Youth" became a publication loved by young intellectuals and some young workers at the time, and under its encouragement and education, millions of young people plunged into the great liberation struggle of the Chinese people. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, "China Youth" was relaunched in Yan'an, becoming a powerful publication guiding the youth movement and helping young people study.

    The current "China Youth" is the organ of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. This publication inherits the revolutionary tradition of the past "China Youth" and takes educating young people with Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and mobilizing them to actively participate in the construction of the new China as its own task. Due to the correct stance taken by "China Youth" and the hard work of the Youth League comrades, it has had a good influence among young people.

    It is very important and meaningful to run "China Youth," a publication with a glorious historical tradition, well. A youth publication that combines theory with practice, connects with the masses, and is armed with Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought can play a great mobilizing and organizational role in the historical cause of uniting and educating the Chinese youth generation.

    In order to further improve this publication, "China Youth" should continue to carry forward the fighting tradition of the past, more closely combine with the actual struggles of the broad masses of young people, and more vividly publicize Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, so that "China Youth" can become a more powerful weapon for guiding the Chinese youth movement and the work of the New Democratic Youth League.

    纪念《中国青年》创刊二十七周年
    任弼时
    《中国青年》由创刊到现在，已有二十七年。在这里，我们不禁回忆起北伐战争时期中，作为中国共产主义青年团的机关刊物——《中国青年》的战斗精神。那时，优秀的中国共产党员、中国人民革命先烈——恽代英同志正是这个刊物的主编。这个刊物传播着马列主义思想，组织青年积极参加反对帝国主义、封建主义的斗争；在中国人民革命运动中，发挥了很大的作用。《中国青年》成为当时青年知识分子及一部分青年工人所喜爱的刊物，在它的鼓舞教育下，千百万青年投入了中国人民伟大的解放斗争。抗日战争时期，《中国青年》又在延安复刊，成为当时指导青年运动、帮助青年学习的有力刊物。
    现在的《中国青年》，是中国新民主主义青年团中央的机关刊物。这个刊物是继承过去《中国青年》的革命传统，而以马列主义——毛泽东思想教育青年并发动他们积极参加新中国的建设事业，作为自己的任务。由于《中国青年》所采取的正确立场和青年团同志们的努力工作，已使它在青年当中发生了良好的影响。
    办好《中国青年》这样一个具有光荣历史传统的刊物，是很重要、很有意义的。一个结合实际、联系群众并为马列主义——毛泽东思想所武装的青年刊物，在团结教育中国青年一代的历史事业上，能够发挥很大的动员作用和组织作用。
    为了更进一步办好这样一个刊物，《中国青年》应该继续发扬过去历史上的战斗传统，更密切地结合广大青年群众的实际斗争和更生动地宣传马列主义——毛泽东思想，使《中国青年》能够成为指导中国青年运动和新民主主义青年团工作的更有力的武器。
