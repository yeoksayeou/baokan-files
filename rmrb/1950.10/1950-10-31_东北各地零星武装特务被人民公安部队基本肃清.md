Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 29th: In recent months, small groups of remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandit agents operating in various parts of Northeast China have been basically eliminated through the coordinated efforts of the People's Public Security Organs and the Public Security Forces. Including secret strongholds uncovered, a total of 681 bandits were annihilated, and 24 light machine guns and submachine guns, and 152 rifles and pistols were seized. These annihilated armed agents and bandits were mainly distributed in the three provinces of Liaoxi, Rehe, and Liaodong in Southern Manchuria; a small number were also present in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces in Northern Manchuria. After the US imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea and US planes bombed and strafed our territory, these bandits believed that "the time had come" and stepped up their activities: on the one hand, they gathered bandits, expanded their organizations, and extensively established secret strongholds to collect intelligence; on the other hand, they spread rumors and looted everywhere, disrupting social order. Since July, our People's Public Security Organs and Public Security Forces have promptly carried out suppression and arrests, and have now completely eliminated the 20 groups of armed agents and bandits in the three provinces of Liaoxi, Rehe, and Liaodong, and are continuing to investigate and suppress the small groups of remnants in Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces.

　　东北各地零星武装特务被人民公安部队基本肃清
    【新华社沈阳二十九日电】最近数月来，在东北各地活动的零星小股蒋匪特务武装，在人民公安机关和公安部队的协同清剿下，基本上已告肃清。连同破获的秘密据点在内，共歼匪六百八十一人，缴获轻机枪、冲锋枪二十四挺，长短枪一百五十二支。这些被剿灭的武装特务土匪，主要分布在南满的辽西、热河和辽东三省；北满的黑龙江和吉林二省也有一小部分。该匪等在美帝国主义发动侵朝战争和美机轰炸扫射我国领土以后，认为“时机已到”，大肆进行活动：一面纠集匪众，扩大组织，广泛建立秘密据点，搜集情报；一面到处造谣抢劫，扰乱社会秩序。自七月份以来，我人民公安机关和公安部队及时地予以清剿和缉捕，现已将辽西、热河、辽东三省的二十股武装特务土匪彻底肃清，并在继续侦剿黑龙江、吉林两省的小股残匪。
