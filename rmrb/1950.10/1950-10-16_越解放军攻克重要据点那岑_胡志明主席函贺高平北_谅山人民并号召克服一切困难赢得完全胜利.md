        Full Text of Ho Chi Minh's Congratulatory Letter
        To the people of the Cao Bằng-Bắc Kạn-Lạng Sơn region, dear compatriots:
    We have just won a great victory in the recent offensive in the Cao Bằng-Bắc Kạn-Lạng Sơn region. This victory should be attributed to your active participation in the anti-imperialist struggle, to the heroism of our Liberation Army, to the determination of our People's Government, and to the unity of our government, people, and army.
    I am very happy to express my gratitude and congratulations to you on behalf of the government. I especially want to commend the great efforts made by the women of the Cao Bằng-Bắc Kạn-Lạng Sơn region. Tens of thousands of women of the Vietnamese, Sọ, Thái, Nùng, Mán, and other ethnic groups competed to build roads, transport ammunition, and do all kinds of other work to help the Liberation Army. They endured all kinds of hardships to help achieve the recent victory.
    We have won the recent battle, but we must all firmly remember that in order to annihilate all the French imperialist troops, in order to oppose American interventionists, and in order to liberate all the territory of our motherland, we must overcome greater difficulties and endure more hardships. After we have gained the recent victory, we must not be complacent and underestimate our enemies. But, because of the unity, enthusiasm, and perseverance of our people, because of the heroism of our army, and because of the determination of our government, we will certainly be able to overcome all difficulties and win complete victory.
    The people of the Cao Bằng-Bắc Kạn-Lạng Sơn region have set an example in mobilizing their manpower, material resources, and financial resources to support the armed struggle against the imperialist aggressors. I am deeply convinced that you will continue to work hard and continue to be at the forefront of this patriotic movement.
    At the same time, I am deeply convinced that the people of all of Vietnam, in carrying out the government's general mobilization, will follow the example of the people of the Cao Bằng-Bắc Kạn-Lạng Sơn region. This is the reason why our long-term struggle will surely win victory and restore the independence and unity of our motherland."
    Representatives of the people of the Cao Bằng-Bắc Kạn-Lạng Sơn region held a ceremony to solemnly read out Chairman Ho Chi Minh's congratulatory letter. At the meeting, the representatives reviewed the activities of various regions in serving the frontline combat troops in the recent offensive. They also passed a resolution to be sent to Chairman Ho Chi Minh, guaranteeing that they would work harder to help achieve greater victories throughout the country.

    胡志明主席函贺高平北?谅山人民并号召克服一切困难赢得完全胜利
    【新华社十五日讯】据越南通讯社十四日电引“越南之声”电台的前线特派记者报道称：越南人民解放军已于十三日下午攻克七溪与谅山间的法军重要据点那岑。至此，越南解放军在东北部前线已从法军手中解放了城市四座，其他三座城市是东溪、高平及七溪。
    【新华社十五日讯】越南通讯社高平十四日讯：越南民主共和国政府胡志明主席，致函高平——北?——谅山地区人民，祝贺最近在越南北部边境前线上的胜利。贺函全文如下：
        胡志明贺函全文高平——北?——谅山地区人民，亲爱的同胞们：
    我们刚刚在最近的高平——北?——谅山地区的攻势中，赢得一个巨大的胜利。这个胜利应当归功于你们积极参加反帝国主义的斗争，归功于我们解放军的英雄主义、我们人民政府的决心、以及我们政府、人民和军队之间的同心同德。
    我很高兴代表政府向你们致谢并祝贺。我特别要赞扬高平——北?——谅山地区的妇女所作的巨大的努力。成万的越南、索族、泰族、侬族、孟族及其他民族的妇女，竞相修路、运送军火以及做其他种种工作，帮助解放军。她们忍受了千辛万苦，帮助取得最近的胜利。
    我们已经赢得最近的战斗，但是我们大家必须牢牢记住：为了歼灭所有的法帝国主义者的军队，为了反对美国干涉者，为了解放我们祖国的全部领土，我们还必须克服更大的困难并忍受更多的辛苦。在我们得到最近的胜利之后，我们一定不要自满和低估我们的敌人。但是，由于我们人民的团结、热情和坚韧的精神，由于我们军队的英雄主义以及我们政府的决心，我们一定能克服一切困难和赢得完全的胜利。
    高平——北?——谅山地区人民，在动员他们的人力、物力和财力支援反对帝国主义侵略者的武装斗争中，树立了一个范例。我深信你们会继续努力，继续在这个爱国运动中走在前面。
    我同时深信：全越南人民在执行政府的总动员中，会向高平——北?——谅山地区的人民看齐。这就是我们的长期斗争一定会赢得胜利、恢复我们祖国的独立和统一的原因。”
    高平——北?——谅山地区人民代表曾举行一个仪式，庄严地宣读胡志明主席的贺函。会上，代表们检阅了各地区在最近一次进攻中为前线战斗部队服务的活动。他们并通过了一项决议送呈胡志明主席，保证他们要更加努力，以帮助在全国各地取得更大的胜利。
