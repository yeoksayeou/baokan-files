　　The Great Year of Implementing the Common Program
    Gao Gang
    We celebrate our first great National Day with boundless joy and striving spirit, celebrate our great victories of the past year, and celebrate the infinitely bright and happy future of our nation.
    Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people, after a long and arduous struggle, finally defeated the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China. The People's Republic of China, a people's democratic dictatorship led by theWorking class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, uniting all democratic classes and all nationalities within the country, was established. Since then, Chinese history has entered a new era, and our nation has stood up. Internationally, it has become an important member of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. The vast people of the world who love peace and democracy unanimously cheered for our victory, while the warmongers of the imperialist bloc showed increasing hatred and fear in the face of our victory.
    Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, the people of Northeast China have united in the past year to realize the Common Program, the great charter of the Chinese people, and have brought their diligence and courage into play, embarking on arduous and planned economic construction.
    As is well known, there are serious difficulties in the face of Northeast China's economic construction. The most important of these is the colonial nature of the original economic base, and the original industrial equipment suffered serious damage from the enemy and puppet regime. In the process of recovery and transformation, it is necessary to constantly overcome the difficulties of lack of funds, lack of equipment, lack of technology, lack of cadres, and especially lack of experience. Under the call of Chairman Mao, the people of Northeast China organized a high tide of economic construction in Northeast China, especially the selfless and heroic labor of the working class, the in-depth study of industrial cadres, and the efforts of technicians, and with the help of the lofty friendship of Soviet experts, overcame and will continue to overcome these serious difficulties. At the same time, we have carried out a resolute struggle against counter-revolutionaries who endanger the people, so that the economic construction of Northeast China is advancing at a speed that is not slow but very fast.
    The general outline of the progress of economic construction in Northeast China can be seen from the following main statistics:
    According to the plan of the Northeast People's Government in 1950, the total value of industrial production this year should reach 193% of last year. The plan for the first half of this year was to complete 41.7% of the annual plan, and the actual completion was 44.1% of the annual plan. In terms of labor productivity, the first half of this year exceeded the plan by 14.1%. At the same time, product costs are constantly decreasing. Taking several major products as examples, coal decreased by 10.56% in the first quarter of this year, steel decreased by 7.9%, chemical industry decreased by 12.18%, paper decreased by 9.53%, and textile industry decreased by 7.4%.
    Railway transportation completed 54.1% of the annual plan in the first half of the year.
    After the land reform, the peasants were liberated from the feudal land system, and an unprecedented upsurge in production enthusiasm appeared. This year's agricultural production plan is to produce 18 million tons of grain including the eastern part of Inner Mongolia. According to surveys and reports from various provinces, it may exceed the plan by 750,000 tons. The average yield per hectare this year may exceed that of 1943 by 204 catties, and exceed this year's planned yield by 132 catties.
    This year's industrial investment is planned to be two and a half times that of last year, and the actual investment in the first half of the year was 50.3% of the year.
    With the development of industry and agriculture, state-owned commerce has also developed greatly. Over the years, it has sold 67% of the peasants' marketable grain and 42% of sideline products, and sold 118,000 billion worth of state-owned products. In terms of supply, it solved 80% of the people's needs for yarn and cloth, 90% of the needs for edible salt, and 71% of the needs for coal, and supplied the raw materials necessary for industry and the food for urban people. The commodities supplied by state-owned commerce in Northeast China, including wholesale to cooperatives and private merchants, account for about 44% of the total amount of commodities needed by society.
    At the same time, cooperatives have also developed greatly. By June of this year, there were more than 11,600 cooperatives, accounting for 32% of the administrative villages, with 9.68 million members, accounting for 24% of the population of Northeast China; the capital increased by 76% in June of this year compared with December of last year; the total retail value was 260% of that in December of last year.
    Due to the development of the state-owned economy and agriculture, private industry and commerce have also developed significantly. Taking Shenyang City as an example, the number of private factories increased by 8.83% in June of this year compared with December of last year; the capital increased by 87.6%; the number of employees increased by 41.85%; the total value of production in the first six months of this year increased by 15.3% compared with the whole year of last year. Although the number of private commercial firms has decreased slightly compared with last year due to the shift to industry and other reasons, the capital in June of this year increased by 18.8% compared with December of last year, and the trade volume in the first six months of this year accounted for 81.8% of the trade volume of the whole year of last year. This shows the normal development of commerce, that is, legitimate commerce has developed, commerce that is not needed by the people has changed its business, and speculative commerce has decreased. In order to support the development of legitimate private industry and commerce, the People's Government has helped them solve difficulties such as raw materials and sales channels, and has appropriately adjusted labor-capital relations. Twenty-five major industries in the city have signed collective labor-capital contracts, so the number of labor-capital disputes decreased from 113 in December of last year to 45 in April of this year.
    From the above facts, it can be seen that Article 26 of the Common Program, which stipulates that "various social and economic components shall cooperate and divide labor under the leadership of the state-owned economy, each getting what it deserves, so as to promote the development of the entire social economy," has been implemented by the Northeast People's Government in restoring and developing the people's economic undertakings.
    With the development of economic construction, people's lives are gradually improving. Since this year, prices have been stable. After the workers' salaries were changed to the eight-grade wage system in April of this year, they increased by an average of 8% compared with December of last year, while technicians increased by an average of 38.9%. In addition, the actual expenditure of labor insurance and welfare undertakings, including medical care, culture and education, safety facilities, and hygiene, by the state for employees accounts for about 18% of the total wages, which is not included. The lives of farmers have also improved significantly. According to a survey of typical villages in Keshan, the purchasing power of each farmer household was 100 the year before last, 136 last year, and 263 this year. At present, except for some disaster areas in Rehe and western Liaoning, many people in rural areas are adding carts and buying horses, opening up new wasteland, and constantly expanding production. Most farmer households have new clothes and bedding, and their livestock are strong. Pigs and chickens are everywhere, and new scenes of building houses, running schools, and improving hygiene can be seen everywhere, showing a new picture of prosperity for both people and wealth.
    As Chairman Mao said: "With the arrival of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear." The cultural demands of the people of Northeast China are growing. There are currently 16 universities in Northeast China, with more than 15,700 students; the number of middle schools has increased by 12.7% compared with last year, the number of students has increased by 38% compared with last year, and the number of teachers has increased by 46% compared with last year; there are now more than 5,000 students in workers' and peasants' middle schools and workers' and peasants' classes, which did not exist last year. There are currently 33,807 primary schools, with 4,576,111 students. The number of winter schools in rural areas last winter increased by 94% compared with the year before last; the number of people attending winter schools increased by 245% compared with the year before last. According to extremely incomplete statistics, there are currently 3,874 workers' cultural night schools, with 297,096 students. The publishing industry in Northeast China has also developed unprecedentedly. In the past six months alone, the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore has published more than 14.26 million copies of various textbooks, more than 4.89 million copies of various books, and more than 2.43 million copies of various magazines. In terms of mass literature and art, in the drama alone, there are more than 7,000 amateur drama troupes in Northeast China, with a total of more than 200,000 people participating. The above-mentioned cultural construction is closely coordinated with economic construction and serves its needs.
    People's representatives' conferences at all levels have played a huge role in economic construction work, and the development of economic construction has also promoted the development of mass political enthusiasm and democratic life. People's representatives' conferences have been held in five of the six provinces in Northeast China, and have exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress in accordance with the provisions of the Common Program. Fifty-six cities (including county towns with a population of more than 30,000) have held two to five meetings, and some cities have exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress; 167 counties have generally held two meetings, and 15 counties have exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress; 84.6% of the 1,877 districts have held meetings; 71.5% of the 31,467 villages have held meetings. At these people's representatives' conferences, democracy was promoted, the central task of developing production was implemented, and many major problems in urban and rural production were solved, such as mobilizing the masses to carry out production movements, adjusting public-private relations and labor-capital relations, promoting urban-rural exchanges, and adjusting people's burdens, all of which have been achieved.
    The above is the main achievements we have made in the Northeast region in implementing the great Common Program over the past year.
    The experience of the past year tells us that the consolidation and development of the people's power is inseparable from the victory of the Liberation War and the completion of the land reform. It is inseparable from the progress and victory of economic construction. And the progress and victory of economic construction is inseparable from the leading role of the state-owned economy. The actual situation of economic construction in Northeast China proves that under the people's democratic power, the development of the people's economy has infinitely broad prospects, and various economies can and have obtained considerable development, and the more the state-owned economy develops, the more the cooperative economy, the individual economy of farmers and handicraftsmen, the private capitalist economy, and the state capitalist economy will obtain appropriate development opportunities and conditions. Experience has also proved that this development must be led by the state-owned economy, with various economies cooperating and dividing labor, each getting what it deserves, and closely integrated with each other. If a certain place unilaterally emphasizes the development of the private economy and ignores the leading role of the state-owned economy, or a certain place isolates the state-owned economy and relaxes the close integration of various economies under the leadership of the state-owned economy, then various social economies cannot be well developed.
    In order to enable various social and economic components to cooperate and divide labor under the leadership of the state-owned economy, each getting what it deserves, so as to promote the development of the entire social economy, according to our experience, it is necessary to strengthen the planning of national economic construction and closely integrate the development of various economies through planning. But experience has also proved that making a completely accurate and comprehensively integrated economic construction plan is not an easy task. It must be repeatedly investigated and studied, and revised in actual implementation before it can become perfect and correct. Actual life shows that if our plan is set too low, it will lose any guiding role and become an obstacle to economic development; but if we do not take into account the size of subjective strength, regardless of whether objective conditions are possible, and regard wishes as plans, then we will commit the mistake of adventurism and cause unnecessary waste to the people's country. Therefore, we must on the one hand patiently persuade some people who overemphasize difficulties and have conservative ideas of stagnation, especially in terms of production plans; at the same time, on the other hand, we must educate and overcome the subjective wishes of some "enthusiasts" who are eager for quick success, especially in terms of basic construction plans. Only in this way can we better implement the "steady advance" policy taught by Chairman Mao.
    The development of economic construction over the past year has also raised many new issues and new experiences for us:
    In the industrial field, the primary issue also lies in grasping production and basic construction plans. The experience of the past year has proved that the key to formulating a relatively detailed and correct industrial production plan lies in how to obtain appropriate coordination between various industrial departments, closely integrate industrial products with market needs, and stipulate reasonable quotas for machinery and equipment, labor efficiency, raw materials, water, and electricity consumption, so as to give full play to the internal potential of industry. When formulating and implementing basic construction plans, the most important thing is to consider our subjective conditions. Under the conditions of our backward technology and insufficient experience today, we must be very cautious when determining any large-scale construction project, and carefully consider design capacity, construction strength, and equipment sources, so as to concentrate the country's limited resources and carry out construction with emphasis and certainty. Before specific construction, we must conduct geological surveys, water and power source investigations, and formally start construction after all design work and necessary material and technical preparations are mature.
    Secondly, in industrial construction, another major issue is how to improve the operation and management of enterprises. This is how the management cadres of people's enterprises learn to run factories and mines well, and organize all workers, technicians, and management personnel to improve the management of funds and costs, strengthen technical management, and promote the piece-rate wage system and bonus system in a planned way. At present, the first thing is to strengthen the work of grassroots units from the bottom up, strictly implement the quota management system and technical responsibility system for workshops, pitheads, and engineering teams, and at the same time, accurately and timely conduct cost accounting from top to bottom according to different enterprises, study and stipulate the normal turnover rate and turnover period of working capital, and use all means to promote and accelerate the turnover of funds. When conditions are available and possible, change to the piece-rate wage system to further stimulate the enthusiasm of all employees and overcome all waste.
    In addition, due to the lack of scientific and technological knowledge of the vast majority of our industrial management cadres and their incompatibility with the industrial technical conditions and equipment conditions in Northeast China, as well as the possible difficulties in mastering new equipment and new technologies in industrial development, it is particularly important to pay attention to technology and cultivate technicians and technical workers in a planned way in industrial construction. This is closely related to improving the quality of our products, ensuring the safe turnover of machinery and equipment, improving the efficiency of machinery and equipment, and further adopting new equipment and technologies. For the needs of production and the requirements of future industrial construction, all industrial management cadres must very seriously and humbly study business and technical knowledge, better unite with technicians, give them certain positions and responsibilities, properly take care of their working conditions and living conditions, organize and lead the technical study of all employees, and run higher industrial schools well to ensure the continuous supply of technical reserve forces in industrial construction.
    In the agricultural field, with the rapid development of agricultural production, farmers have a large amount of surplus grain and sideline products that need to be sold, and they need to be supplied with inexpensive and high-quality means of production and means of livelihood. Therefore, the supply and marketing work in the rural economy is becoming more and more important. At present, many of our cadres who lead rural work only pay attention to the local problems in rural production, and generally lack sufficient attention to the supply and marketing work in rural areas. In terms of supply and marketing departments, they generally only pay attention to the supply of means of livelihood to farmers, and pay little attention to solving the means of production (such as carts, horses, farm tools, fertilizers, seeds, etc.) for farmers. On the issue of production, they are mostly circling around mutual aid groups and the large and small sizes of mutual aid groups, and they have not paid enough attention to the work of improving technology (such as improving farm tools, improved varieties, chemical fertilizers, and improving farming methods), building water conservancy projects (such as building large reservoirs), and creating protective forest belts, which are urgently demanded by the vast number of farmers, and they have not yet organized farmers in solving these problems. We must overcome all difficulties to meet these demands of farmers in order to further develop agricultural productivity and improve the lives of farmers.
    The problems existing in the above-mentioned industrial and agricultural production are related to our commercial work. Due to the rapid development of industry and agriculture, the commercial work is still lagging behind the needs of production development, so the exchange between urban and rural areas is not smooth and active enough, which directly affects the normal development of industrial and agricultural production. In order to solve this key problem in economic development, we must overcome the view of neglecting commerce, strengthen the attention and leadership of the Party and the government to commercial work, strengthen domestic and foreign trade, give full play to the role of commerce as a link, correctly grasp the price policy, rationally organize the circulation of materials, and operate our commerce by means of economic accounting. Through commerce, various economies can be linked together so that they can all obtain full development.
    In this great year, our work has been successful. However, with the development of economic construction, many new issues have been raised for our Party and the People's Government, which need to be resolved. Therefore, there is no reason for us to be proud and complacent. We must be humble and prudent, conscientious and responsible, seriously examine our work, solve the problems and difficulties facing us, and overcome various shortcomings and mistakes. And we must always be vigilant and eliminate the sabotage of counter-revolutionaries. Only in this way can we better develop our economic construction and other construction undertakings. The people of the entire Northeast unite, under the banner of Chairman Mao, to advance our economic construction to new victories, thereby consolidating our national defense, defending the border of the motherland, opposing the American imperialist aggressors, and maintaining world peace.

　　实施共同纲领的伟大一年
    高岗
    我们以无限愉快和奋勉的心情，庆祝我们第一个伟大的国庆日，庆祝我们过去一年的伟大胜利，庆祝我们民族无限光明幸福的前途。
    在毛主席和中国共产党的领导之下，中国人民经过长期的艰苦斗争，终于战胜了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本在中国的反动统治。建立了工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的、团结各民主阶级和国内各民族的人民民主专政的中华人民共和国。从此中国历史进入了一个新的时代，我们民族已经站起来了。在国际上，已经成为以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的重要一员。全世界爱好和平民主的广大人民一致为我们的胜利而热烈欢呼，帝国主义集团的战争贩子们则在我们的胜利面前日益表现仇恨和惊惧。
    东北人民在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，在过去的一年里，团结一致，为实现中国人民大宪章——共同纲领，发挥了自己的勤劳与勇敢，开始了艰巨的有计划的经济建设。
    如众所周知，在东北经济建设面前，是存在着严重困难的，其中最主要的就是原有的经济基础的殖民地性，原有的工业设备，又遭受了敌伪的严重破坏，在恢复与改造过程中，必须不断克服缺乏资金、缺乏装备、缺乏技术、缺乏干部，特别是缺乏经验的困难。东北人民在毛主席的号召之下，组织了东北经济建设的高潮，特别是工人阶级忘我的英雄劳动，工业干部的钻研与技术人员的努力并得到苏联专家崇高友谊的帮助，克服了并将继续克服着这些严重困难。同时与危害人民的反革命分子进行了坚决的斗争，从而使东北经济建设以不是很慢而是很快的速度在前进着。
    从下面的几个主要统计数字上，可以看出东北经济建设的进展概貌：
    按照东北人民政府一九五○年的计划，今年工业生产总值要达到去年的百分之一九三，今年上半年计划完成全年的百分之四一点七，实际完成全年计划的百分之四四点一。以劳动生产率来看，今年上半年超过计划百分之十四点一。同时产品成本在不断降低，以几种主要产品为例：今年第一季煤炭类降低百分之十点五六，钢铁类降低百分之七点九，化工类降低百分之十二点一八，纸张类降低百分之九点五三，纺织类降低百分之七点四。
    铁路运输，上半年完成全年计划百分之五四点一。
    经过土地改革之后，农民从封建土地制度下解放出来，出现了空前高涨的生产积极性。农业生产今年计划连内蒙东部地区共产粮一千八百万吨，根据调查和各省报告，可能超过计划七十五万吨。今年一垧地平均产量可能比一九四三年超出二百零四斤，比今年计划产量超出一三二斤。
    工业投资今年计划为去年之两倍半，上半年实际投入了全年的百分之五十点三。
    随着工业与农业的发展，国家商业也有了很大的发展，年来推销了农民商品粮食的百分之六十七，副业产品的百分之四十二，推销国营产品十一万八千亿。在供给方面，解决了人民纱布需要量的百分之八十，食盐需要量的百分之九十，煤炭需要量的百分之七十一，并供给了工业必需的原材料与城市人民的食粮。国营商业在东北区内供给社会需要的商品包括批发给合作社与私商的在内，约占社会需要的全部商品总额的百分之四十四。
    同时合作社也有了很大发展，到今年六月已有一万一千六百多处，占行政村百分之三十二，社员九百六十八万人，占东北人口的百分之二十四；资金到今年六月比去年十二月增加百分之七十六；零售总值为去年十二月的百分之二百六十。
    由于国营经济和农业的发展，私营工商业也有了显著发展，以沈阳市为例：私营工厂家数今年六月比去年十二月增加百分之八点八三；资金增加百分之八十七点六；职工增加百分之四十一点八五；生产总值今年六个月比去年全年增加百分之十五点三。私营商业的家数因转向工业等原因虽较去年略有减少，但资金在今年六月较去年十二月增加百分之十八点八，今年六个月的贸易额占去年全年贸易额的百分之八十一点八，这说明了商业正常发展的状况，即正当商业发展了，为人民所不需要的商业转业了，而投机商业则减少了。人民政府为扶助正当私人工商业的发展，曾帮助他们解决了原料、销路等困难，并适当调整了劳资关系，全市有二十五个主要行业签订了劳资集体合同，因而劳资争议去年十二月份为一一三件，而今年四月份则减为四十五件。
    从上面的事实中，可以看出：共同纲领第二十六条所规定的“各种社会经济成份在国营经济领导之下，分工合作，各得其所，以促进整个社会经济之发展”。已为东北人民政府在恢复与发展人民经济事业中所贯彻。
    随着经济建设的发展，人民的生活正在逐步提高。今年以来，物价稳定。工人薪金今年四月改为八级工资制后，比去年十二月平均提高百分之八，技术人员则平均提高百分之三十八点九，此外，国家为职工支出连医药、文教、安全设施、卫生等费在内的劳保福利事业费的实际支出，约占工薪总数百分之十八，尚不包括在内。农民生活也有显著的提高，据克山典型村调查，农民每户购买力，前年为一○○，去年为一三六，今年为二六三。目前农村除热河辽西部分灾区外，很多人民添车买马，新开荒地，不断扩大生产，大多数农户家中，衣被一新，耕畜肥壮，猪鸡成群，而且到处可以看到建筑房屋，兴办学校，改进卫生，呈现人财两旺的新的景象。
    正如毛主席所说：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”东北人民的文化要求正在日益增长。东北现有高等学校十六所，学生一万五千七百余人；现有中学比去年增加百分之十二点七，学生比去年增加百分之三十八，教师比去年增加百分之四十六；现在工农中学及工农班学生有五千余人，这是去年所没有的。现有小学三三八○七所，学生四五七六一一一人。去冬农村冬学比前年增加百分之九十四；上冬学人数比前年增加百分之二四五，工人文化夜校据极不完全统计，现有三千八百七十四处，有学生二十九万七千零九六名。东北的出版事业亦有了空前的发展，仅最近半年间东北新华书店，就已出版各种教科书一千四百二十六万余册，各种书籍四百八十九万余册，各种杂志二百四十三万余册。在群众文艺方面仅戏剧一项，全东北即有业余剧团七千多个，参加的群众共达二十余万人。上述文化建设是紧紧配合着经济建设进行并为它的需要而服务的。
    各级人民代表会议对于经济建设工作发挥了巨大的作用，而经济建设的发展，同时也促进了群众政治积极性与民主生活的发展。东北六省有五省开过人民代表会议，并按共同纲领的规定，代行了人民代表大会的职权，五十六个城市（包括三万人口以上的县城）均开过两次到五次，部分城市并代行了人民代表大会的职权；一六七个县已普遍开过两次，有十五个县代行了人民代表大会职权；一八七七个区中有百分之八四点六开过；三一四六七个村中有百分之七一点五开过。在这些人民代表会议上，发扬了民主，贯彻发展生产这一中心任务，解决了城乡生产中许多重大问题，诸如发动群众生产运动，调整公私关系和劳资关系，促进城乡交流，调整人民负担等等，均有了成就。
    以上所述，就是我们在东北地区实施伟大的共同纲领一年来的主要成就。
    一年来的经验告诉我们：人民政权的巩固与发展，是同解放战争的胜利，土地改革的完成分不开的。是同经济建设的前进与胜利分不开的。而经济建设的前进与胜利，又与国营经济的领导作用分不开的。东北经济建设发展的实际情况证明了：在人民民主政权下面，人民经济的发展，有着无限广阔的前途，各种经济均可能而且已经获得相当的发展，而国营经济愈发展，合作社经济、农民和手工业者的个体经济，私人资本主义经济和国家资本主义经济也就愈加获得适当的发展机会和条件。经验又证明：这种发展，必须是以国营经济领导的、各种经济分工合作、各得其所、并相互密切结合的，如果那个地方片面强调了发展私营经济忽视了国营经济的领导作用，或那个地方孤立地强调国营经济而放松各种经济在国营经济领导之下的密切结合，则各种社会经济都不能获得很好地发展。
    为了使各种社会经济成份在国营经济领导之下，分工合作、各得其所，以促进整个社会经济之发展，根据我们的经验：就要加强国家经济建设的计划性，通过计划将各种经济的发展密切结合起来。但经验又证明：要做一个完全准确、全面结合的经济建设计划不是一件很容易的事，它必需经过反复考察研究，经过实际执行中的修正，才能趋于完善与正确。实际的生活说明：如果我们的计划定的低了，它将失去任何指导作用，而成为经济发展的障碍；但如果不计主观力量的大小，不管客观条件是否可能，把愿望当做计划，那就要犯冒险主义的错误，而给人民国家造成无谓的浪费。因之，我们必须一方面耐心说服某些人员过分强调困难，停滞不前的保守观念，特别是在生产计划方面；同时在另一方面又要教育克服某些“热心家”急于求成的主观愿望，特别是在基本建设计划方面。只有这样，才能更好地贯彻毛主席所教导我们的“稳步前进”的方针。
    一年来经济建设的发展，同时给我们提出了许多新的问题与新的经验：
    在工业方面：首要的问题亦在于掌握生产及基本建设计划。一年来的经验证明，制订一个比较周密的正确的工业生产计划，关键在于如何求得各个不同的工业部门之间互相适当的配合，使工业产品和市场需要密切结合，并规定合理的机器设备，劳动效率、原材物料、水、电消耗的定额，以发挥工业的内在潜力。在制订和执行基本建设计划时，最主要的是必须考虑我们主观的条件。在今天我们技术落后，经验不足的条件下，要确定任何一件较大的建设工程，都必须十分慎重地考虑设计能力、建设力量和设备来源。以便把国家的有限资财，集中使用；同时有重点有把握地进行。而在具体施工以前，必须经过地质勘测，水源电源调查，在一切设计工作及必要的材料和技术上的准备成熟时，再正式施工。
    其次，在工业建设中，另一个重大的问题是如何改善企业的经营管理工作。这就是人民企业的管理干部如何学会办好工厂、矿山，组织全体工人、技术人员、管理人员一道来改善资金与成本的管理，加强技术管理与有步骤地推行计件工资制与奖金制，在目前首先就是一方面从下而上地加强基层单位的工作，严格实行车间、坑口，及工程队的定额管理，及技术责任制度，同时自上而下地根据不同的企业精确地及时地进行成本核算，研究和规定流动资金正常的周转率和周转期限，用一切办法，来促进和加速资金的周转，在条件具备和可能的情况下，改行计件工资制度，以更加发挥全体职工的积极性，克服一切浪费现象。
    此外，由于我们绝大多数工业管理干部，科学技术知识不足及其与东北工业技术条件和设备条件的不相适应，以及在工业发展中，掌握新设备、新技术时，可能遇到更多的困难等情况，因此在工业建设中，重视技术和有计划地培养技术人员和技术工人，便具有特别重要的意义，这是和改进我们产品的质量、保证机器设备安全周转和提高机器设备的效率，以及进一步采用新的设备和技术有密切关联的问题。为了生产的需要，和将来工业建设的要求，一切工业管理干部，均必须十分认真十分虚心地学习业务和技术知识，更好地团结技术人员，给他们一定的职务和责任，妥善地照顾他们的工作条件和生活条件，组织和领导全体职工的技术学习，并办好高等工业学校，以保证在工业建设上源源不绝的技术后备力量的补充。
    在农业方面：随着农业生产的迅速发展，农民有大量余粮与副业产品要求出售，要求供给价廉物美的生产资料与生活资料，因而农村经济中供销工作愈加重要了。目前我们不少领导农村工作的干部，还只是注意农村生产中的局部问题，而对农村的供销工作普遍缺乏足够的注意。在供销部门方面，一般地也只注意了对农民生活资料的供给，而对农民生产资料（如车马、农具、肥料、种籽等）则很少注意解决。在生产问题上，也多是在互助组以及互助组的大型小型等问题上打圈子，而对于广大农民迫切要求的改良技术（如改良农具、优良品种、化学肥料，改进耕作方法等）、兴修水利（如修大的蓄水库）造防护林带等工作注意的还很不够，还没有在解决这些问题方面把农民组织起来。我们必须克服一切困难满足农民这些要求，以便进一步发展农业生产力与改善农民的生活。
    在上述工农业生产方面所存在的问题，是同我们的商业工作有联系的，由于工业与农业迅速地发展了，但商业工作尚落后于生产发展的需要，因而形成城乡内外的交流不够通畅与活跃，这就直接影响到工农业生产的正常发展。为了解决这个发展经济中的关键问题必须克服轻视商业的观点，加强党和政府对于商业工作的注意和领导，加强国内与国外贸易，发挥商业的纽带作用，正确地掌握价格政策，合理地组织物资流通，并以经济核算的方法，经营我们的商业。通过商业，把各种经济衔接起来，以便都能获得充分的发展。
    在这伟大的一年中，我们的工作是有成绩的。但随着经济建设的发展，又在我们党和人民政府面前提出了许多新的问题，要求解决。因之，没有任何理由可以使我们骄傲自满。我们必须谦虚谨慎，兢兢业业，认真检查自己的工作，解决摆在我们面前的问题和困难，克服各种缺点和错误。并时刻警惕与肃清反革命分子的破坏。只有这样，才能更好地发展我们的经济建设及其他建设事业。全东北人民团结起来，在毛主席的旗帜下，把我们的经济建设推进到新的胜利，从而巩固我们的国防，保卫祖国的边疆，反对美帝国主义侵略者，维护世界的和平。
