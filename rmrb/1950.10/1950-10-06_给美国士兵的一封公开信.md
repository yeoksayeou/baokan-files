An Open Letter to American Soldiers
    艾佛尔·蒙德鸠

    So, you're in uniform again. Maybe you suddenly received a mobilization order and were forced to abandon your home against your will. Or perhaps you are one of the "reservists," one of those many Americans whom the "free competition" system cannot guarantee work for and who now want to use this imagined possibility to support their families.

    Perhaps the trenches of Korea, or the jungles of the Philippines, or the smoke-shrouded mountains of Taiwan await you.

    When you last wore a uniform, all honest people welcomed you as comrades. But now, wherever you go, you will be met with hatred.

    If you want to see people smile at you, you will have to pay for it or use threats to achieve your goals.

    Mothers and children will avoid you, and when you approach, they will flee. Men will gather all their strength to ambush you in the dark of night and kill you.

    Everywhere you will be surrounded by hatred. The soldiers of the People's Army who defend their homeland, who take up arms to fight for their country's independence under extremely difficult and arduous conditions—just as your ancestors once fought—will form a united front against you. The American flag has become a symbol of terror and mass murder of humanity.

    Sooner or later you will wonder: What is this all about? And, honestly, what are you doing?

    Someone will tell you that you are defending America, protecting peace, saving democracy, resisting aggression, obeying the United Nations, and fulfilling your duty as a soldier. All of this—is a lie.

    Defending America? Defending it from a distance of six thousand miles from the nearest American coast? Do you think the Koreans want to attack you? Is that why President Truman ordered "B-29" bombers to destroy the farms and houses of North and South Korea?

    Protecting peace? Protecting it from whom? From the "terrible Russians"? Have you not carefully considered who is currently waging wars in many countries around the world? In Malaya—it is the British, and there is not a single Russian soldier there. In Vietnam—it is the French, and there is not a single Russian soldier there. In Korea—it is the Americans, and there is not a single Russian soldier there.

    The defenders of "order and tranquility" and the believers in Christianity "under the threat of materialism" send flamethrowers, cannons, and jet planes to these countries. Thousands of miles away from their own territory, they defend their investments, "strategic interests," and enslaved labor, fighting against those who are striving for the independence of their homeland.

    Saving democracy? But with what kind of democrats are your masters cooperating? And who do they want to put on the throne?

    Chiang Kai-shek? Hasn't his thoroughly corrupt tyranny been exposed in the eyes of people all over the world?

    Hirohito? Wasn't it he who ordered the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, the massacre of American prisoners of war, and planned bacteriological warfare?

    Syngman Rhee? He established a special "democratic" system in South Korea, under which countless newspapers were closed down, all progressive parties were completely banned, political leaders were murdered, members of parliament were arrested, tens of thousands of people were thrown into prison without trial, prisoners were tortured, and voters were killed on their way to the polling stations.

    Syngman Rhee, desperately clinging to power, is opposed by three-quarters of his own parliament.

    Saying it is resisting aggression? Then where does the aggression come from? And against whom? The only aggression that has occurred in Korea is being committed by President Truman's soldiers. You are the only foreigners there, and there are no Russians there.

    Someone tells you that "North Korea" attacked "South Korea," this is a lie.

    Perhaps you have noticed how anxiously your President Truman and General MacArthur are preventing the North Koreans from presenting their views to the United Nations, and that they ordered the bombing of peaceful residents five hours before requesting the United Nations to endorse these actions.

    Perhaps no one told you that Syngman Rhee imprisoned all the members of his own parliament who opposed attacking North Korea. They also wouldn't tell you that Syngman Rhee's generals openly boasted that they had crossed the 38th parallel last year, and that his Minister of Interior publicly declared on the radio that the war was launched by Syngman Rhee.

    In essence, what is North Korea and South Korea all about? No one considers this boundary to be permanent; it is merely a temporary boundary after Japan's defeat.

    Look at the bodies of the women killed by American bombs! Can you find any difference between North Korean and South Korean women?

    Do you see the artillery fire on the hills? Who is shooting? North Koreans or South Koreans? No! They are just Koreans who hope that you will return to the country you came from and let their homeland have peace.

    Saying it is the United Nations? I think you know the United Nations Charter, on which your country also solemnly signed.

    This charter prohibits interference in the internal affairs of any country. The charter specifies that in the event of a conflict, the views of both parties should be heard (this was not done at the time).

    The charter prohibits all countries from taking military action unless it is defensive or approved by the United Nations Security Council.

    The charter stipulates that the Security Council may not approve military action without the consent of the five permanent members of the Security Council. At the time, two permanent members of the Security Council were absent from the meeting. One of them, China's representative, was unable to attend because of your government's opposition. The other was the Soviet Union, whose representative was absent in protest against the failure to allow China's representative to attend.

    The representatives of those countries that praised American intervention in Korea are desperately trying to portray this action as being in accordance with the United Nations Charter.

    Sometimes they even assert that this action has full legitimacy.

    But sometimes they also say: "Perhaps, in fact, it must be admitted that our actions are not entirely in accordance with the Charter. But after all, we cannot allow any article in the Charter to hinder us."

    They assert this, just as Hitler said in the past, and just as those villains who lynch black people in the southern states of America say.

    As for Taiwan, neither Truman nor MacArthur, nor even they, dare to present any basis to prove the legality of this action.

    Do you think, why are Truman and MacArthur so concerned about maintaining the form of support from the United Nations?

    This is because they also clearly understand that without the support of the United Nations (in fact, from a legal point of view, this support does not exist), their actions would be openly criminal.

    The military action using American troops against Korea—which has not been legally approved in accordance with the United Nations Charter—is a criminal act that violates America's solemn obligations, a criminal act that violates international law. Similarly, so is its action against Taiwan. It is the same as Hitler's crimes against Czechoslovakia and Poland.

    Think all of this over carefully! Truman says that the actions they took without the consent of Congress are not "war."

    But for you, this is clearly war. And when you are crawling in the trenches, with bullets flying around—bullets used against you and your comrades, against those Korean patriots who want to drive the robbers out of their own country—you understand this very clearly. Truman can never mitigate America's crimes with deceitful lies.

    Perhaps there is a special feeling when soaring at an altitude of six thousand meters, dropping bombs on Korean women and children! What a novelty! Isn't it? And their fathers and husbands cannot retaliate against your families.

    But don't be too complacent! I have seen how German pilots bombed the Spaniards in Barcelona. They thought they were superior and thought they could escape destruction, but they still could not escape being punished.

    Truman, Dulles, and MacArthur will not succeed in Korea. The people oppose them, and the people will not allow them to run rampant.

    You have been dragged into this adventure, which will trap you in thorns. All honest people in the world will unite against you.

    And before this adventure ends, unprecedented and serious disasters will befall the people of your country.

    Therefore, now you must say: "No!"
          (Translated by Jin Ge from Wenxue Bao, August 26, 1950)

### 给美国士兵的一封公开信

　　给美国士兵的一封公开信
    艾佛尔·蒙德鸠
    就是这样，你又穿上了军装。也许是，你突然接到了动员令，被迫违背着自己的意愿而抛开家园。或者，你大概是“后备军”之一员，是那许多“自由竞争”制度不能保障他们的工作而只有现在想利用这假想的可能来养活家庭的美国人之一。
    也许是朝鲜的战壕，或是菲律宾的丛林，再或者是台湾青烟笼罩的山岳在等待着你。
    当你上次穿着军装的时候，一切正直的人们曾像对战友一样欢迎你。但是现在，不管你走到哪里，到处都将遭到憎恨。
    假如你想看到人们对你的笑容，那么，你要为此拿出代价来，或者用威胁手段才能达到自己的目的。
    母亲们和孩子们将要躲开你，而当你走近了的时候，他们会逃避开。男人们将拿出一切的力量来，在夜幕笼罩下埋伏着等候着并打死你。
    到处你都会被憎恨所包围。那些坚守自己的家园的人民军战士们，为了在极端困难和艰苦的条件下，拿起武器为祖国的独立而战——正如从前你的祖宗们作战一样——将结成一条反对你的统一战线。美国的旗帜已成为恐怖和大规模屠杀人类的象征了。
    迟早你总会疑问：这一切是什么一回事呢？而且，老实话，你正在做什么呢？
    有人会对你说是在防护美国，保卫和平，挽救民主，抵抗侵略，服从联合国和完成你兵士的义务。这一切——都是说谎。
    是防御美国？在距美国最近的海岸也有六千英里的距离之外防御吗？难道你想，朝鲜人要攻击你吗？杜鲁门总统是为了这个原因而命令“Ｂ——二九”的轰炸手毁灭北朝鲜及南朝鲜的田庄和房屋吗？
    是保卫和平？为了防谁而来保卫呢？防“可怕的俄罗斯人”吗？你没有仔细想想，谁现在正在世界上许多国家里进行着战争？在马来亚——是英国人，那里并没有一个俄国兵。在越南——是法国人，那里并没有一个俄国兵。在朝鲜——是美国人，那里也并没有一个俄国兵。
    “秩序和安宁”的保卫者和“在唯物主义威胁下”的基督教的信徒们把火焰喷射器，大炮和喷气式飞机送到这些国家里。在远距本国疆土数千英里之外保卫他们的投资，“战略利益”和奴役劳动，进行反对那些争取自己祖国独立的人们。
    是挽救民主？但你的主子们与怎样的民主主义者合作呢？他们又想把谁扶上皇座呢？
    蒋介石？他的腐朽透顶的暴行不是已在全世界人们眼里暴露无遗了吗？
    是裕仁？不是他曾下令偷袭珍珠港，屠杀美国战俘并筹划细菌战争的吗？
    是李承晚？他在南朝鲜建立了一套特殊的“民主”制度，在这个制度下无数的报纸被封闭，一切进步党派也完全受到禁止；在这个制度下，政治领袖被杀害，国会议员被逮捕，成千成万的人们不经审判的被投入监狱，被监禁的受到拷打，而选民在去到选举站的途中被杀害。
    李承晚，他绝望地抓住政权不放手，连他自己的国会都有四分之三的人反对他。
    说是抵抗侵略吗？那末侵略又从何而来？又向谁侵略呢？在朝鲜发生的唯一无二的侵略，正是杜鲁门总统的兵士们干的。你们在那里是唯一的外来者，那里并没有俄国人。
    有人对你说，是“北朝鲜”向“南朝鲜”进攻，这是说谎。
    大概你已注意到，你的总统杜鲁门和麦克阿瑟将军那么慌张地阻挠北朝鲜人到联合国组织陈述自己的意见，而且他们在要求联合国赞助这些行动之前五小时，他们已下令轰炸和平居民了。
    大概没有人对你说，李承晚把自己国会中所有反对进攻北朝鲜的议员们都监禁起来了。他们也不会对你说，李承晚的将军们曾公开夸口说他们在去年已越过三八线，而他的内务长官也曾在广播中公开声明，战争是李承晚所发动的。
    本质上讲，北朝鲜和南朝鲜到底是什么回事呢？这条境界，并没有任何人认为它是永久的，它只是在日本失败后的一条临时境界而已。
    看一下被美国飞机投弹炸死的妇女的尸体吧！到底是北朝鲜还是南朝鲜的妇女，你能找得出任何区别吗？
    你看见那山丘上的炮火吗？是谁在射击呢？北朝鲜人还是南朝鲜人？不！这只是朝鲜人，他们希望，你还是回到你出发的那个国家去，让他们的祖国得到安宁。
    说是联合国吗？我想你是知道联合国宪章的，你的国家也在这上面庄严地签了字。
    这宪章禁止干涉任何国家的内政。宪章内指明，如发生冲突，应听取双方的意见（当时并没有做到这一点）。
    宪章禁止所有国家采取军事行动，除非它带有防御的意义或是经联合国安理会认可的。
    宪章规定：如果没有得到安理会五个常任理事国的同意，安理会就不得批准军事行动。而当时安理会常任理事国有两个未出席会议。其中之一中国的代表所以未能出席，是因为你们政府的反对。另外一个就是苏联，苏联代表所以缺席是因为抗议没有让中国的代表出席。
    那些颂扬美国干涉朝鲜的国家的代表们，是极力企图把这一行动描述为符合于联合国宪章的。
    有时他们竟断言，这一行动具有充分的合法性。
    但有时他们又说：“可能，事实上也应当承认，我们的行动不尽符合于宪章。但是归根结底，我们不能容许宪章中任何一条会妨碍我们”。
    他们这样断言，正如希特勒过去所说的一样，也正如那些在美国南部各州私刑拷打黑人的恶棍们所说的一样。
    至于台湾，那么，不管是杜鲁门还是麦克阿瑟，甚至他们都不敢提出任何根据证明这一行动的合法性。
    你想，为什么杜鲁门和麦克阿瑟这样关心着维持联合国方面的支持的形式呢？
    这是因为他们也很清楚地了解，没有联合国的支持（事实上，从法律的观点上说，这个支持是并不存在的），他们的行动就带有公开的犯罪性了。
    利用美国军队反对朝鲜的军事行动——它未经符合于联合国宪章的合法认可——是违反了美国庄严的义务的犯罪行为，是违犯国际公法的犯罪行为。同样地，它对台湾的行动也是如此。它与希特勒反对捷克和波兰的罪行是同出一辙的。
    把这一切都仔细想想吧！杜鲁门说，他们没有经国会同意而采取的行动并不就是“战争”。
    但对于你，这却是明明白白的战争。而且，当你在战壕里匍匐着，四周子弹在飞鸣——这些子弹是用以对付你和你的同伴们，对付那些朝鲜爱国者想驱出自己国境的强盗们——的时候，你对这一点是了解得很清楚的。杜鲁门决不能以欺骗说谎的阴谋来减轻美国的罪行。
    也许，翱翔在六千公尺的高空，把炸弹向朝鲜妇女和儿童扔去，会发生一种特殊的感觉吧！多新鲜的玩意呀！不是吗？而他们的父亲和丈夫是丝毫不能向你家庭报复的。
    但是，不要太得意了！我看见过德国的飞行员们是怎样投弹轰炸巴塞伦的西班牙人。他们自以为优越并认为他们能逃避灭亡，但仍逃脱不了被膺惩。
    杜鲁门，杜勒斯和麦克阿瑟是不能在朝鲜得手的。人民反对他们，而人民是不容许他们猖狂的。
    你被拖进了这个冒险里，这个冒险要使你陷于荆棘丛中。全世界一切正直的人们会团结起来反对你。
    而且，在这个冒险结束以前，空前严重的灾难会降临到你本国人民的头上。
    因此，现在你要说：“不！”
          （金戈译自五○年八月二十六日文学报）
