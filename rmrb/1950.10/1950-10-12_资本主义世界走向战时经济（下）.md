The Capitalist World Moves Towards a Wartime Economy (Part 2)
    By Manukyang, Soviet Union

    After American imperialism embarked on the path of open war preparations, it demanded that its Western European vassals follow suit. The rearmament plans announced by many countries indicate that the ruling groups of the Marshallized Western European nations are surrendering to Washington's ultimatum. Unfortunately, they are abandoning their much-touted economic recovery plans and plunging into the arms race.

    The British Labour government issued a statement on August 3rd, planning to increase military spending to £3.4 billion over the next three years, which is £1.133 billion per year. This means an increase of 50% over the already excessive level. Such huge military expenditure is indeed too heavy for Britain today. But this is not caused by its defense needs. British financial and economic circles fully understand that increasing military spending can only be achieved by reducing consumption of the masses, or reducing production for export and tightening basic investment. In fact, however, Washington has deprived Western European governments of the right to plan military spending.

    The current events in Western Europe thoroughly reveal the essence of the Marshall Plan. Since the London Foreign Ministers' Conference in May, the military purpose of this so-called "European Recovery Program" has become more obvious. "Business Week" bluntly talked about "the shift of the Marshall Plan from butter to guns":

    "According to the Marshall Plan, investment in consumer goods industries will be replaced by investment in industries directly or indirectly related to military affairs."

    Officials implementing the Marshall Plan have told Britain and other vassal states about another "wish" of Washington. The local currency obtained from selling goods under the Marshall Plan (i.e., the so-called counterpart funds), which in Britain were used to repay part of the national debt, must now be entirely used for military expenditure. Many Western European newspapers admit that this measure will inevitably lead to fierce inflation. As one newspaper accurately pointed out, its effect is just like issuing the same amount of new banknotes and putting them into circulation.

    This policy of military expansion by American imperialism is not only a reactionary, vicious, and anti-people policy in general, but also a policy that worsens the already struggling economies of Western European countries.

    French Prime Minister Pleven (whose government also announced a three-year rearmament plan of approximately two trillion francs) still stubbornly claimed that he would never abandon the task of construction because of rearmament. The importance of this statement is not due to Pleven's empty promises that are never fulfilled, but because it is an official and public acknowledgment of the fact that the crazy arms expansion implemented according to American orders is incompatible with the economic interests of France.

    Western European countries with slightly clearer minds cannot fail to understand how dangerous Washington's demands are to the economic life of European countries. The French newspaper "Economy and Finance" published in Paris pointed out that the increase in weapons production will reduce the production of automobiles, tractors, and electrical equipment, etc., and will inevitably reduce foreign exchange income.

    Moreover, even the "Wall Street Journal" admitted:

    "Whether with funds from the Marshall Plan or outside of this fund, all the rearmament measures being planned are harmful to economic recovery... The United States may be able to give its people both cannons and butter for a period of time, but the exhausted economies of Western European countries cannot do it."

    It must be pointed out that even now—before the new and massive military plans are implemented and the new high tax policies have not yet been implemented—the working people of capitalist countries have already paid the price for the American aggression against Korea, which is a sharp decline in their living standards. Although the "Wall Street Journal" has denied it, the United States is by no means an exception in this regard. According to reports, since the end of June, food prices in the United States have risen by 15% to 20%. In West Germany, retail food prices rose by 22.2% from April 1st to August 1st, of which flour rose by 17.3%, black bread rose by 22.2%, beef rose by 12.5%, pork rose by 22.2%, and so on.

    Although the industrial production of Western European countries increased slightly in the autumn and winter of 1949, this cannot eliminate the deep-rooted and growing crisis tendencies manifested in the sharp decline in industrial production in the summer of 1949, the prevalence and continuous increase of unemployment, financial chaos, and the serious phenomenon of agricultural crisis.

    The increase in unemployment was so rapid that the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe first realized that it needed to dedicate a section of its annual report specifically to deal with this issue.

    Even in some countries where the annual report did not see a serious crisis, the investigators had to point out the following: in the Netherlands, for every 100 vacancies, there were only 90 job seekers in 1948; but by 1949, it had increased to 180. In France, for every 100 vacancies, there were 244 applicants in 1948, but by 1949, it had increased to 673.

    The situation is even worse in Australia, Finland, Denmark, and Ireland.

    But according to the annual report, the worst situation is in Italy, Belgium, and West Germany, where in some areas, as many as one-third of the adults are unemployed. In the most recent period, the number of unemployed residents in Belgium has never been less than 11% of those with the ability to work. The total number of unemployed people in urban and rural areas of Italy has reached 4 million. The annual report also acknowledges this conservative estimate.

    It must be pointed out that this attempt to put Western European countries' economies on a wartime footing is being carried out under conditions of continued instability in industrial production. In Britain, as confirmed by the "London and Cambridge Economic Bulletin" on this point, industrial production did not increase even by 1% in the three months from April to June 1950. In Belgium, in the period from June 1949 to May 1950, the index of industrial production never reached the level of February to May 1949. In Italy, industrial production only exceeded last year's level in March this year, but it was clearly below this level before and after March. In the Netherlands, the average monthly level of industrial production was always lower than the last four months of 1949.

    It can also be pointed out that in France, Belgium, and Luxembourg, the production of steel and coal has been reduced. In the first half of this year, the average monthly steel production in Belgium was 300,000 tons, while last year's monthly production was 360,000 tons. France produced 504,000 tons of steel in March, while in the same period a year ago, in March 1949, it could produce 826,000 tons. The average monthly steel production in France in the first five months of 1950 was 680,000 tons, while the average monthly production in the same period last year was 765,000 tons.

    The increase in steel production in Britain and West Germany, to be honest, is also due to squeezing France, Belgium, Saar, and Luxembourg out of the export market, and Britain has reduced its imports of Belgian steel semi-finished products. West German steel companies have increased their load because American companies have placed large orders in view of the cheap labor under the rule of the puppet Bonn government here. According to the "Daily Metal Report" on July 28, 20% of the orders in West German companies belong to Americans.

    The mutual assurances of unity and cooperation between the rulers of Western Europe and Washington have not eliminated the intensification of their struggle for markets. This struggle has become more intense due to the increasing difficulty of sales.

    The United States' exports have been declining continuously in the first half of this year, with a total of US$4.8929 billion in six months, while in the same period last year it was US$6.6727 billion, that is, this year is 27% lower than last year. The exports of Western European countries (calculated in their devalued currencies!) have increased slightly. But none of the major Western European countries can reduce their trade deficit. For example, in Britain, the import surplus in the trade balance in the first seven months of this year reached £259.4 million, while in the same period in 1949 it was £241 million. Belgium's import surplus increased from a total of 2.02 billion francs throughout 1949 to a total of 5.154 billion francs in the first six months of 1950. The exports of some capitalist countries have clashed with other exporting countries, especially Germany and Japan.

    The bosses of the British railway equipment manufacturing industry complained about the competition from Germany, France, and Japan. Although British companies tried their best, Thailand still ordered a large batch of goods from Japan. The Republic of South Africa ordered 100 locomotives from Krupp (in West Germany) for US$4 million under the promise of low prices and early delivery. German optical equipment is sold at prices 25% lower than its competitors. The products of the Ford Motor Company in Cologne are 10% cheaper than the same style of British cars.

    West Germany and Japan, which are controlled by American monopoly capital, have increasingly become sharp weapons competing with Marshallized countries. The wages of West German workers are less than 75% of the wages of workers in British companies. American monopoly capitalists use this cheap labor to develop the export of products from their factories in West Germany and Japan.

    In 1949, Japan exported 750 million yards of cotton cloth, and Britain exported 940 million yards. This year, Japan's cotton cloth exports will reach about 1 billion yards, while Britain's exports will decrease.

    The situation in Western European countries is further complicated by the growth of debt to the United States.

    The debt of capitalist countries to the United States after the war has increased from US$2 billion to US$13.5 billion. American private investment abroad has increased from US$15 billion to US$19 billion. These figures once again prove that the United States has become the center of financial exploitation in the capitalist world.

    Now, American imperialism is pushing Western European countries into an arms race, putting their economies on a wartime footing, so that these countries are more subservient to itself. Undoubtedly, one of the motivations for Wall Street to force its vassals to strengthen the state budget for their fatal military expenditures is to further undermine their competitive position in the world market. For example, the United States does not object to Britain's rearmament by reducing exports, lowering workers' living standards, and reducing investment in basic industries. Because this can only strike a blow to British competitors in the world market.

    As usual, in the period of strengthening war preparations, reactionary employers and bourgeois governments intensify the exploitation and oppression of the working class. They use terror policies to deal with all attempts by the working people to protect their economic interests and civil rights.

    The "Wall Street Journal," the mouthpiece of monopoly capital, recently depicted the beautiful scenery of peace and industrial prosperity. It is beneficial for us to understand these ideals, because it is a template copied by the Truman administration when submitting many bills to Congress.

    The "Wall Street Journal" lyrically wrote: "A company produces brush cloth in Georgia, castings in Ohio, and work clothes in California. In short, it has everything that American entrepreneurs dream of.

    "It pays low wages, does not have to pay taxes, does not have to pay rent, and there are no labor unions there. In 1949, it could make a profit of 17% for every dollar's worth of goods sold. It does not have to worry about workers being absent from work, because the workers live behind the fence here. The company we are talking about here is the United Prison Factory."

    Prison workshops, this is the example to be imitated and the model of a well-organized and highly profitable enterprise! A huge prison that can imprison the working class, this is the "ideal" that American entrepreneurs dream of. This is the true face of the often touted "American way of life"!

　　资本主义世界走向战时经济（下）
    苏联  曼努克扬
    美帝国主义走上了公开的备战道路之后，即要求他的西欧附庸也追踪而来。许多国家所宣布的重行武装的计划，即表明马歇尔化西欧各国统治集团正在华盛顿的最后通牒面前投降。不幸的是他们把自己到处吹嘘的经济复员的计划抛开，而投向军备竞赛了。
    英国工党政府在八月三日发表一项声明，打算把最近三年的军费提高至三十四亿镑。即每年为十一亿三千三百万镑。这就是说，较现在已经过高的水平还要提高百分之五十。这样庞大的军费，对于今日的英国来说，确实是太重了。但这并不是因为它的防御需要而引起的。英国财政经济界完全明白，只有缩减广大群众的消费，或者减少为出口的生产及紧缩基本投资才能增加军费的扩充。然而，事实上华盛顿已把西欧各国政府计划军备的权利取消了。
    西欧目前所发生的事件，彻底显示出马歇尔计划的本质。从五月间的伦敦外长会议起，这个名为“欧洲复兴计划”的军事目的变得更加明显。“商业周刊”曾露骨地谈到“马歇尔计划从牛油向枪炮的转变”：
    “按照马歇尔计划，对生产消费品工业的投资将被对直接或间接带有军事性工业的投资所代替。”
    执行马歇尔计划的官员们曾告诉英国及其他附庸国关于华盛顿的另一个“愿望”。按马歇尔计划出卖商品所得的本国货币的款项（即所谓对等基金——译者），例如在英国曾用来偿还部分国家债务，从现在起就得整个用作军事支出了。很多西欧报纸都承认这种措施必然会引起激烈的通货膨胀。这和某一报纸所精确指出的一样，它的效果恰似发行同量的新纸币，并使之流通一样。
    美帝国主义这种军备扩张政策，不仅一般的是一个反动的、恶毒的、违反人民利益的政策，而且是一个使现在还勉强可以维持的西欧各国经济变得更坏的政策。
    法总理普利文（他的政府也宣布了一个约需两万亿法郎的三年重整军备计划）还强辩地声称，他任何时候也不会因重整军备而抛弃建设的任务。这个声明之所以重要，决不是因为普利文那些从不兑现的空洞允诺，而是由于这是官方公开承认按照美国命令而实施的疯狂扩军，是与法国经济利益不相容的这一事实。
    西欧各国头脑稍微清醒的人们不会不明白华盛顿的要求对欧洲各国经济生活有多大的危险。巴黎出版的法国“经济与财政”报指出，武器生产的增长，使汽车、拖拉机和电气设备等的生产降低，因而将不可避免地削减外汇收入。
    而且，连《华尔街日报》也承认道：
    “不论以马歇尔计划的款项或在此款项之外，正在开始计划的所有重整军备措施，对于经济复员都是有害的……美国或许在一个时期内还能给予本国的人民大炮也给予他们牛油，但西欧各国已呈衰竭的经济却办不到。”
    必须指出，即使在现在——当新的庞大的军事计划实现之前，新的高税政策尚未实施，资本主义各国的劳动人民已为美国侵略朝鲜而付出代价了，这就是使自己生活水平激烈下降。虽然《华尔街日报》曾予否认，但美国在这方面也绝不例外。据报载，六月底以来，美国食品价格已上涨了百分之十五至二十。在西德，从四月一日到八月一日零售食品的价格上涨了百分之二十二·二，其中面粉上涨了百分之一七·三，黑面包上涨了百分之二二·二，牛肉上涨百分之一二·五，猪肉上涨百分之二二·二等等。
    一九四九年秋冬两季，西欧各国的工业生产量虽略有增加，但这并不能消灭那表现在一九四九年夏季工业生产量锐降，失业的普遍与不断增加，金融混乱，农业危机的严重现象等所造成的那种根深蒂固而且日益增长的危机倾向。
    这次失业的增加是如此之速，以致联合国欧洲经济委员会第一次察觉到须要专门以它年报的一节来对付这个问题。
    即使在一些年报里没有看出危机严重的国家中，考察的人员也不得不指出以下各点：在荷兰，一百名的空额，一九四八年求职者只有九十人；但到一九四九年已增至一百八十人了。在法国，一百名空额在一九四八年有二百四十四名申请者，到一九四九年就增到六百七十三名了。
    在澳大利亚、芬兰、丹麦和爱尔兰，情况还要坏些。
    但据年报指出，情况最坏的是意大利、比利时和西德，那里有些地区没有工作的成年人竟达三分之一。在最近一个时期，比利时居民中失业人数从未少于有劳动能力者的百分之十一。意大利城乡的失业总数则已达四百万。年报也承认这个保守的估计。
    必须指出，这个使西欧各国经济走上战时体制的企图，是在工业生产继续不稳定的条件下进行的。在英国，如象《伦敦与剑桥经济业务》公报关于这点所证实的，一九五○年四月至六月的三个月，工业生产连百分之一都没有增加。在比利时，一九四九年六月至一九五○年五月的这一个时期中，工业生产的指数从来也没有达到过一九四九年二月至五月时的水平。在意大利，只有今年三月时工业生产才超出了去年的水平，但在三月之前及以后却都很明显地在这一水平之下。在荷兰，每月工业生产的平均水平总是低于一九四九年最后的四个月。
    还可以指出，在法国、比利时及卢森堡，钢铁和煤的产量都有缩减。今年上半年，比利时每月平均钢产量是三十万吨，而去年每月产量却是三十六万吨。法国在三月份生产的钢是五十万四千吨，而在一年前的同一时期，即一九四九年三月，却能生产八十二万六千吨。一九五○年前五个月中法国钢的平均月产量是六十八万吨，而去年同一时期中每月的平均产量则为七十六万五千吨。
    英国和西德钢产量的增加，老实说，也是由于把法国、比利时、萨尔和卢森堡挤出于输出市场，而英国又缩减了比利时钢铁半制品进口的缘故。西德制钢企业之所以增加负荷，是因为美国公司鉴于这里波恩傀儡政府统治下的廉价劳动力而予大批定货的关系。据《每日五金报导》七月二十八日载称，西德企业里百分之二十的定货是属于美国人的。
    西欧统治者们和华盛顿对于团结与合作的相互保证并没有消除他们争夺市场斗争的尖锐化。这个斗争是因销路的日益困难而更趋激烈了。
    美国今年上半年的出口在不断地下降，六个月中总数为四十八亿九千二百九十万美元，而在去年同一时期则为六十六亿七千二百七十万美元，即今年比去年降低百分之二十七。西欧各国的出口（按其贬值了的货币计算！）有稍微的增加。但却没有一个主要的西欧国家能消减其对外贸易上的逆差。例如英国，今年头七个月中贸易差额中的入超数字即达二亿五千九百四十万镑，一九四九年同一时期则为二亿四千一百万镑。比利时的入超从一九四九年全年总共二十亿零二百万法郎提高到一九五○年头六个月的总数已达五十一亿五千四百万法郎。一些资本主义国家的出口已和其他出口国家，特别是德国与日本发生冲突了。
    英国铁路器材制造业的老板们埋怨着德国、法国和日本的竞争。虽然英国公司尽力争取，但泰国还是向日本定了一大批货物。南非联邦在低价和早期交货的允诺下以四百万美元向克虏伯（在西德）定了一百辆机车。德国的光学器材以低于竞争者百分之二十五的价格出售着。在科隆的福特汽车公司产品的售价，要比同一样式的英国汽车便宜百分之十。
    在美国独占资本掌握下的西德和日本，其工业已越来越成为与马歇尔化各国竞争的锐利武器了。西德工人的工资不到英国企业里工人工资的百分之七十五。美国独占资本家就利用这种廉价的劳动力以发展他们设在西德和日本的工厂产品的出口。
    一九四九年日本出口的棉布是七亿五千万码，英国出口是九亿四千万码，那么，今年日本棉布输出将达十亿码上下，而自英国输出的则要减少了。
    由于对美国债务的增长，西欧各国的情况更为复杂了。
    战后资本主义国家对美国的欠债，已从二十亿美元增加为一百三十五亿美元。美国在国外的私人投资，从一百五十亿美元增加到一百九十亿美元。这些数字又一次地证明，美国已变成资本主义世界中财政剥削的中心了。
    现在，美帝国主义正在把西欧各国推向军备竞赛，使其经济走上战时体制，以便这些国家更大程度地服从自己。无疑地，华尔街强迫他的附庸们强化其致命的军费支出的国家预算的动机之一，就是为了要更进一步地破坏他们在世界市场上的竞争地位。例如，美国对于英国的减少出口、降低工人生活及减少对基本工业的投资而重整军备，就全不加以反对。因为这只能给世界市场上的不列颠竞争者以打击。
    一如通常的情形，在加强战争的准备时期，反动雇主和资产阶级政府对工人阶级的剥削压榨更其加紧。他们用恐怖政策来对付劳动人民保护自己经济利益与公民权利的一切企图。
    独占资本的喉舌《华尔街日报》，不久前曾描绘了他们对和平与工业繁荣的美景。我们体味一下这些理想是有益的，因为它是杜鲁门政府向国会提出许多法案所抄袭的范本。
    《华尔街日报》抒情地写道：“一个公司在乔治亚生产刷布，在俄亥俄生产铸品，在加利福尼亚生产工服。总之，它有着美国企业家所幻想的一切。
    “它付着低微的工资，不用纳税，不必缴租，那里没有工会。一九四九年，每出卖一块钱的东西，它就可获得百分之十七的利润。它用不着操心工人旷工，因为工人就住在这里的栅栏后面。这里所谈的公司，就是联合监狱工厂。”
    监狱作坊，这就是供人模仿的榜样和组织良好、获利优厚的事业之典型！可以监禁工人阶级的巨大牢狱，这就是美国企业家寤寐以求的“理想”。经常吹嘘的“美国生活方式”的本来面目原来如此！
