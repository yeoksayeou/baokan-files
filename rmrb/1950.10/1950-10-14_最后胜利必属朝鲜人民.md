　　Final Victory Will Surely Belong to the Korean People
    Helanni Ke
    I arrived in Korea when the military situation was very serious. The heroic Korean people are fighting bravely with admirable spirit against the enemy, who temporarily holds technical superiority, and against the ruthless bombing of the American air force. Every Korean man and woman is in high spirits. The entire Korean people are determined to fight to the final victory. I cannot find suitable words to describe the spirit of the Korean people. I met workers, farmers, men, women, old and young, everyone knowing only one goal: everything for the front, everything for the final victory. Man for man, the Korean soldier is far superior to the American soldier, because every Korean soldier knows that he is defending his country's freedom against foreign aggressors who want to turn Korea into their colony.
    The American aggressors, abusing their technical advantage in the skies, are brutally bombing peaceful residents, killing the elderly, women, and children. I personally witnessed some of the barbaric atrocities—one might even say crimes—of American pilots, who dropped bombs on villages that had no strategic or military value whatsoever. I saw the look of terror in the eyes of Korean children whenever they heard the ominous sound of an approaching airplane. I also saw destroyed schools, cultural institutions, and poor people's homes. I can say this: every honest man and woman in the world must condemn these crimes committed by the American air force. American pilots apparently believe they have the power of life and death over innocent people, some of whom are unaware of the existence of the United Nations Security Council, whose flag has been so brutally stolen by American imperialism.
    As for the Korean people, the American's evil bombing cannot destroy their spirit. After witnessing the scenes in Korea, I deeply admire the Korean people for their struggle for freedom and democracy, against the imperialist system of slavery. "We will fight to the last man. No matter how the recent military situation changes, final victory will always belong to us." I heard these two sentences everywhere. I am certain that final victory will belong to this great and heroic Korean people. Their struggle is the struggle of all honest people in the world. The Korean people know this. They know they are not isolated. It is this knowledge that multiplies their courage, gives them the steel-like, indestructible determination to defeat the aggressors and fight for the liberation of their country.

　　最后胜利必属朝鲜人民
    赫朗尼克
    我到朝鲜正在军事情势很严重的时候。英勇的朝鲜人民面对着暂时在技术上占优势的敌军，和美国空军无情的轰炸，而以可佩的精神奋勇地战斗着。朝鲜的男人和女人个个士气高涨。全朝鲜人民都有战到最后胜利的决心。我找不出适当的言词来描述朝鲜人民的精神。我遇到工人、农民，男女老少，大家只知道一个目的：一切为了前线，一切为了最后胜利。就人对人来说，朝鲜士兵是远优于美国士兵的，因为每个朝鲜士兵都知道自己正在保卫祖国自由，对抗要使朝鲜变成他的殖民地的外国侵略者。
    美国侵略者滥用着他们在天空的技术优势残暴地轰炸和平居民，杀害老年人、妇女和儿童。我亲眼看到一些美国飞行员的野蛮暴行——也可以说罪行——他们就向那些没有战略目标或是任何军事对象的村庄投掷炸弹。我见到朝鲜小孩子们每逢听见一架迫近的飞机的不吉声响，就在眼睛上流露出来的那种恐怖的神情。我又见到一些被炸毁的学校、文化机关和贫民住屋。我可以这么说：世界上每一个诚实的男女都必须谴责美国空军所犯的这些罪行。美国飞行员们显然自以为操有对于无辜的人民的生杀之权，有些无辜的人民还不知道联合国安理会的存在，而那旗帜已被美帝国主义这么粗暴地所盗用了。
    至于朝鲜人民，美国的罪恶轰炸是无法摧毁他们的精神的。在目睹了朝鲜的景象之后，我十分钦佩朝鲜人民，为争取自由和民主，反对帝国主义的奴役制度而斗争。“我们要战到最后一人。无论最近的军事情势有怎样变化，最后胜利总是属于我们的。”——这两句话我是到处听到的。我确信着最后胜利一定属于这伟大英勇的朝鲜人民。他们的斗争就是全世界一切正直的人们的斗争。朝鲜人民知道这一点。他们知道他们并不孤立。就是这一种认识使他们的勇气增添了好多倍，使他们有了钢铁一般不可摧毁的决心，来击败侵略者而争取祖国的解放。
