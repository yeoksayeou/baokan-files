　　New District Farmers Actively Pay Autumn Grain After Understanding Burden Policy
    Some Areas Still Need In-Depth Policy Publicity to Alleviate Farmers' Concerns.
    [This newspaper dispatch] Since the promulgation of the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas," farmers in various places, after understanding the spirit of these regulations, have considered them fair and reasonable. Hunan Province started the autumn grain collection arrangements earlier this year, and the delivery of grain to warehouses was also earlier. Deng Ye, a farmer from Jin Du Township, Changsha County, Hunan Province, said, "This year we are handing in liberation grain, who wouldn't like that?" Chunhua Township in the Fourth District was assigned a task of 510,000 jin, and completed 420,000 jin in three days. When representatives from all walks of life in counties such as Lichuan and Fengcheng in Jiangxi Province discussed the provisions of Article 15 of the provisional regulations, the representatives said: "Calculating tenant farming income at 80 jin for every 100 jin is a correct consideration for poor and hired peasants; calculating rental income at 120 jin for every 100 jin, but limiting the landlord's burden to a maximum of 50 percent, also takes care of the landlord's livelihood." Li Qi, a poor peasant from Banqiao Township, Hengyang, initially did not understand "progressive taxation" and was afraid of being "progressively taxed." After the cadres explained the progressive method to him, he calculated that he only had to pay 25 jin. He said, "This is fair, I will definitely hand it in quickly and well." Farmers in Puzhong Township, Cixi County, Zhejiang Province, are very satisfied with the provisional regulations' assessment based on normal annual yield, which prevents hard-working households from suffering and lazy households from benefiting. Last year, when collecting grain, some villagers in this village, because they did not understand the policies of the People's Government, indulged in drinking and eating extravagantly, and did not plant spring flowers or dredge river mud in the spring, resulting in eating grass seeds and bran this first half of the year. Now they say: "After understanding the policy, we must hand in public grain early and economize on production." After widespread publicity of the burden policy, it not only stabilized the farmers' production mood but also enabled the farmers to further appreciate the policy of "taking from the people and using for the people." Zheng Guzi, a farmer from Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, said: "In the past, the Kuomintang forced us to send public grain without any benefit; today, the People's Government collects public grain and uses it all on us. During the famine months, they lend us grain and distribute relief grain, how can we not send it properly?" After understanding the burden policy, rich peasants also expressed their support. For example, rich peasant Zu Haiyun from Changsha County mobilized his entire family to send grain together. Individual landlords attempted to deny and conceal their income, but were severely reprimanded by the farmers. For example, landlord Kang Jianzhou from Changsha County, who had more than 100 dan of land rent, concealed 9 shi last year and paid 800 jin less grain. This year, he tried to conceal his yield again, but the farmers exposed him on the spot, and he was forced to report everything.
    In some areas, due to insufficient publicity, coupled with the rumors and sabotage of lawless landlords, farmers still have many concerns about this year's burden policy. For example, farmers in Banqiao Township, Third District, Hengyang, Hunan, still do not know who exactly the progressive method will "progressively tax." When sorting out land and assessing yields in Pingwen Village, Wuming County, Guangxi, middle peasants were afraid of reporting the truth because they feared "raising their class status and being struggled against," and poor peasants were afraid of reporting the truth because they feared "paying more rent to the landlords." In some areas, although there were burden methods last year, the cadres did not act according to the law, so the farmers still have some doubts about this year's "assessment according to the rate." They said: "The method is good, but we are afraid you won't be able to do it." Therefore, at present, it is still necessary to vigorously publicize the burden policy and dispel the farmers' various ideological concerns. (Yi Zhi)

　　新区农民了解负担政策后
    积极交纳今秋公粮
    有些地区尚须深入宣传政策，解除农民顾虑。
    【本报讯】《新解放区农业税暂行条例》公布以来，各地农民明白了这个条例的精神后，都认为公平合理。湖南省今年秋征布置较早，送粮入库也较早，该省长沙县金圫乡的农民邓冶说“今年交的是翻身粮，那个不喜欢”。四区春华乡分配任务五十一万斤，三天即完成四十二万斤。江西黎川、丰城等县各界代表会在讨论暂行条例第十五条的规定时，代表们说：“佃耕收入一百斤作八十斤计算，这是正确的照顾了贫雇农；出租收入以一百斤作一百二十斤计算，但地主最高只负担百分之五十，也照顾了地主的生活。”衡阳板桥乡贫农李启开始对“累进计征”不了解，怕“累”到自己头上来，干部把累进办法告诉他，他计算了一下，自己只出二十五斤，他说：“这样公平，我一定交快，交好。”浙江慈溪县浦中乡的农民，对暂行条例按常年应产量计征，不使勤苦耕作的户吃亏，和怠于耕作的户讨巧，非常满意。该村农民在去年征粮时，因为不懂人民政府的政策，有些人喝酒吃肉大肆浪费，春天不种春花，不埝河泥，弄得今年上半年吃草子、糠皮。现在他们说：“了解政策以后一定早交公粮，节约生产。”负担政策广泛宣传以后，不仅安定了农民的生产情绪，而且使农民对“取之于民，用之于民”的政策有了进一步的体会。湖南平江县农民郑谷子说：“过去国民党押起我们送公粮，没有一点好处；今天人民政府收公粮，都是用在我们身上，荒月间又贷粮又发救济粮，我们还不好好送？”富农了解负担政策后，也都表示拥护，如长沙县富农祖海云动员全家老幼一齐送粮。个别地主企图抵赖隐瞒，遭到农民的严厉申斥。如长沙县地主康建周，有田租百多担，去年瞒了九石，少出八百斤粮；今年又想隐瞒产量，农民当场予以揭穿，他被迫全部报出。
    某些地区由于宣传不够深入，加上不法地主的造谣破坏，农民对于今年负担政策仍然存在着很多顾虑。如湖南衡阳三区板桥乡的农民，还不知道累进办法到底要“累”谁。广西武鸣县平稳村整理土地和评定产量时，中农怕报实了“提高阶级成份受斗争”，贫农怕报实了“多向地主交租”。有些地区去年虽有负担办法但干部并未依法办事，因此农民对今年的“依率计征”仍有一些怀疑。他们说：“办法好是好，就怕你们做不到。”因此目前尚须大力进行宣传负担政策，解除农民各种思想顾虑。（易之）
