Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 1st. TASS Moscow, October 1st: To commemorate the twelfth anniversary of the publication of Stalin's brilliant work, "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks): Short Course," Moscow newspapers published editorials and special articles on the 1st, reviewing the all-conquering power of this book in the struggle for communism.

	Pravda published an editorial entitled "A Powerful Weapon in the Struggle for Communism," stating: The publication of Stalin's brilliant work was an event of great importance to the ideological life of the Party, the Soviet people, and the world communist movement. The great, all-conquering ideals of Marxism-Leninism pointed out by Stalin in this book have penetrated the hearts of hundreds of millions of working people, ignited flames in their hearts, and inspired them to wage selfless struggles for the victory of communism.

	The great power of Stalin's book lies in its profound and scientific explanation of the theory and history of the Bolshevik Party, and its summary of the historically significant experience of the Bolshevik Party, which no other party in the world possesses or has ever possessed. This Short Course elucidates the history of the Bolshevik Party based on the development of the main concepts of Marxism-Leninism. The epic of the Bolshevik Party is an amazing example, showing people how to wage a consistent and indomitable struggle for the revolutionary transformation of society, so as to realize the ideals of Marxism-Leninism. The history of our Party is Marxism-Leninism in action, it is the history of overthrowing the Tsar, landlords, and bourgeois regime, the history of building the first socialist country in the world, and the history of the Soviet Union's socialist victory under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin.

	Lenin and Stalin's doctrines on the victory of socialism in one country, on the Soviets as the best form of political organization of society in the transition period from capitalism to communism, on the Party as the leading and guiding force in the system of the dictatorship of the working class, and on the Party as the leader and organizer of the masses in the struggle for communism, have been proven by historical experience and put into practice.

	The editorial continued: Stalin's masterpiece clearly shows the deep and inseparable unity between Marxism-Leninism and the policies and practical activities of the Bolshevik Party, and it shows the international nature of the Party's strategy and tactics. With the publication of the History of the Communist Party, we have a true encyclopedia of basic knowledge on Marxism-Leninism.

	The editorial pointed out: Over the past twelve years, millions of Soviet people have successfully mastered Bolshevism, using the History of the Communist Party as a basis for study. Stalin's book has helped the Soviet people, especially those in responsible positions and intellectuals, to study the theory of Marxism-Leninism, so as to successfully carry out the task of communist construction. It educates the people in the spirit of vibrant Soviet patriotism, in the spirit of friendship among all nationalities and proletarian internationalism; it helps the working people to fully appreciate and deeply understand the solemn and great prospects of the gradual transition from socialism to communism in the Soviet Union, and to understand the historical significance of the struggle being waged by all progressive mankind, led by the Soviet Union, to defend world peace and to oppose the imperialist instigators of war. Comrade Stalin's brilliant masterpiece has armed the Communist and Workers' Parties and all working people in the People's Democratic countries with the victorious experience of the Soviet state in building socialism, helping them to victoriously realize the task of struggling for socialism.

	The editorial concluded: The Soviet people are celebrating the twelfth anniversary of the publication of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) amidst new, vast, and extensive construction projects. The Soviet government's historic decisions on the gigantic construction projects on the Volga, Dnieper, and Amu Darya rivers are vivid evidence of the strength of the Soviet state, and of the victory of the all-conquering ideals of Lenin and Stalin.

　　莫斯科各报发表社论和专文
    纪念联共党史出版十二周年
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科一日电：莫斯科各报为纪念斯大林的天才杰作“联共（布）党史简明教程”出版第十二周年，特于一日发表社论和专文，评述此书在为共产主义而斗争中所发挥的足以战胜一切的力量。
    真理报以“为共产主义而斗争中的强有力的武器”为题发表社论称：斯大林的这部天才著作的出版，是对党、苏联人民和全世界共产主义运动的思想生活具有极大重要性的事件。斯大林在这本书中所指出的马列主义的伟大的足以战胜一切的理想，已深入亿万劳动人民的心中，在他们的心上点燃起火焰，激励他们为共产主义的胜利而进行忘我的斗争。
    斯大林的这本书的伟大力量，就在于它将布尔塞维克党的理论和历史加以深湛的科学的说明，将布尔塞维克党的具有世界历史意义的经验加以总结，而布尔塞维克党所拥有的这种经验，在世界上没有任何其他政党具有或曾经有过。这部简明教程以马列主义主要的概念的发展为基础，阐明了布尔塞维克党的历史。布尔塞维克党的史诗是令人惊奇的典范，昭示人们怎样为了对社会进行革命改造，而进行始终如一的不屈不挠的斗争，以使马克思列宁主义的理想付诸实现。我党的历史是行动中的马列主义，它是推翻沙皇、地主与资产阶级政权的历史，是建设世界上第一个社会主义国家的历史，是苏联在列宁和斯大林党的领导下取得社会主义胜利的历史。
    列宁和斯大林的关于在一国家取得社会主义胜利、关于苏维埃之作为从资本主义到共产主义的过渡时期中社会的政治组织的最好形式、以及关于党作为工人阶级专政的体系中的领导和指导的力量、关于党作为为共产主义而斗争中的群众的领袖和组织者的这些学说，已为历史经验所证明，并已付诸实践。
    社论继称：斯大林的这部杰作，很清楚地显示出马列主义与布尔塞维克党的政策及其实际活动之间的深刻的与不可分割的统一，它显示出党的战略和策略的国际性。联共党史一出版，我们就有了一部关于马列主义方面的基本知识的真正百科全书了。
    社论指出：过去十二年来，千百万苏联人民以联共党史作为学习的基础，已胜利地掌握了布尔塞维主义。斯大林的这本书帮助了苏联人民，主要的是处于负责地位的干部和知识分子来研究马列主义的理论，以胜利地执行共产主义建设的任务。它以生气蓬勃的苏维埃爱国主义的精神、以各族人民友爱和无产阶级国际主义的精神教育人民；它帮助劳动人民充分地体会及深刻地了解苏联从社会主义向共产主义逐渐过渡的庄严伟大的前途，了解以苏联为首的全体进步人类为了保卫全世界的和平、为了反对帝国主义的战争煽动者而正进行着的斗争的历史意义。斯大林同志的这部天才杰作，以苏维埃国家的胜利的建设社会主义的经验，武装了人民民主国家中的共产党和工人党以及一切劳动人民，帮助他们胜利地实现为社会主义而斗争的任务。
    社论结语称：苏联人民在新的广大辽阔的建设工程中间来庆祝联共（布）党史出版第十二周年。苏联政府关于伏尔加河、第聂伯河和阿姆河畔巨大建设的历史性的决定，乃是证明苏联国家的力量、证明列宁和斯大林的足以战胜一切的理想的胜利又一个生动的证据。
