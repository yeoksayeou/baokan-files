　　Youth Work in the People's Liberation Army Since the Agrarian Revolutionary War

　　Youth work has a long history in the People's Liberation Army. The Communist Youth League in the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army during the Agrarian Revolutionary War, the youth teams in the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army during the Anti-Japanese War, and the New Democratic Youth League established in the People's Liberation Army over the past year, all played a significant role in the revolutionary war under the leadership of the Communist Party in the army.

　　Agrarian Revolutionary War Period

　　During the ten-year Agrarian Revolutionary War, tens of thousands of members of the Communist Youth League actively participated in the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army at that time. The well-known Young Communist International Division was composed of more than 10,000 young people from the Jiangxi base area, more than 70 percent of whom were members of the Communist Youth League. The Hubei-Henan-Anhui base area also had organizations of the Young Communist League. Under the leadership of the Communist Youth League members, a large number of young people went to the front lines. The Jiangxi base area, with only two million people, once had 50,000 people joining the army in a month, most of whom were young people. The Youth League also mobilized young people to actively participate in supporting the front lines, supporting the army, and giving preferential treatment to the families of Red Army soldiers, making itself a heroic supporting force of the Red Army.

　　At that time, the Communist Youth League in the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was a shock force in all work and battles in the army. The Youth League united and educated the vast number of young people through mass youth organizations in the army – the youth teams. The Youth League regularly conducted Marxist-Leninist education among young people and Youth League members through the youth team's team lessons. At that time, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army often organized a commando team to go deep into the enemy's rear to be responsible for raising funds, collecting intelligence, confiscating land and distributing it to farmers, mobilizing and organizing the masses, and attacking the enemy as circumstances permitted. These commando teams were organized by the best Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. Many heroes in the long and arduous battles and in the 25,000-mile Long March, such as crossing the Wu River, seizing the Luding Bridge, and rushing through the Lazikou Pass, were Youth League members and young people.

　　At that time, every company of the Red Army had a Lenin Room (equivalent to the current club), and Youth League members were the main participants and organizers. They mobilized all young people to participate in the activities of the Lenin Room, such as bayonet competitions, air defense exercises, grenade throwing, sand table operations, singing, wall newspapers, and hygiene parties. These activities played a great role in enlivening the troops, learning culture and military technology, and carrying out health campaigns. Singing was very common in the Red Army. When the higher authorities had calls, the young people would compile them into songs. Even when life was extremely difficult when crossing the grasslands, eating highland barley, and gnawing on cowhide, the singing was still continuous. Writing poetry on gunstocks, learning to read on backpacks, and learning to read on the ground were common methods used by the Red Army in cultural learning at that time.

　　In November 1935, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a decision on youth work, determining to change the organization and working methods of the Communist Youth League in order to carry out the task of mobilizing and organizing the vast number of young people to fight for national liberation. Therefore, the organization of the Chinese National Liberation Vanguard was created in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. At that time, most of the Communist Youth League members in the Red Army gloriously joined the Communist Party.

　　Eight-Year Anti-Japanese War Period

　　After the start of the Anti-Japanese War, hundreds of thousands of young people joined the army, including a large number of members of the Chinese National Liberation Vanguard, as well as members of the Youth National Salvation Corps in Guangzhou, Xuzhou, and other places, and members of the Guangdong Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard, who all became the backbone of the youth in the army. The First Youth Congress held in Yan'an in 1937 decided to establish youth national salvation associations in various liberated areas. By 1940, there were more than one million members in various liberated areas. The Youth National Salvation Association played a great role in mobilizing young people to join the army, supporting the front lines, participating in militia, and carrying out work in various places. After 1940, the Youth National Salvation Associations in the Jin-Cha-Ji, Shandong, and Jin-Southeast liberated areas established basic youth armed organizations – the Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard – to cooperate with the Eighth Route Army in combating the Japanese invaders.

　　Youth work departments were established in the political departments at all levels of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, and youth team organizations were generally established. The youth teams played a significant role in opening up base areas, persisting in fighting behind enemy lines, and various other tasks.

　　Four-Year Liberation War Period

　　During the four-year People's Liberation War, the youth in the army, under the leadership of the Communist Party, bravely stood on the forefront of the People's Liberation War, creating tens of thousands of model shooters, model gunners, tankmen, explosion heroes, and combat heroes. Among the 350 combat heroes attending this National Combat Heroes Representative Conference, 243 were under the age of 30, and 118 were between the ages of 18 and 25. People like Liu Sihu, Lü Shunbao, Liu Kuiji, Wei Laiguo, Guo Junqing, Tian Guangwen, and Li Guangzheng... are all famous young combat heroes. After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed to experiment with building the League in various liberated areas in October 1946, the New Democratic Youth League was gradually established in various places. Youth League members were a leading force in joining the army, participating in the war, and supporting the front lines. Youth League members were the first to sign up for the army, and young farmers who had been allocated land after the land reform also poured into the People's Liberation Army in large numbers. In 1949, the First National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League decided to try to build League organizations in the army. In July of the same year, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission (i.e., the current Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission) jointly issued a decision on building the League in the army. By October of this year, the entire army had nearly 250,000 League members. Youth League members have made brilliant achievements in various tasks such as bandit suppression operations, Hainan Island landing operations, troop production, and cultural learning. In the future, under the leadership of the Communist Party, youth work in the army will be further developed on the basis of building a strong national defense force, and will become a great force in carrying out patriotic and revolutionary heroism movements in the army.

　　土地革命战争以来
    人民解放军部队中的青年工作
    青年工作在人民解放军部队中有着悠久的历史。在土地革命战争时期中国工农红军中的共产主义青年团，抗日战争时期八路军和新四军中的青年队以及一年多来在人民解放军中建立的新民主主义青年团，在部队中共产党的领导下都对革命战争起了很大的作用。
    土地革命战争时期
    在十年土地革命战争中，数以万计的共产主义青年团团员踊跃地参加当时的中国工农红军。当时有名的少共师便是由江西根据地的一万多个青年组成，其中百分之七十以上是共产主义青年团员。鄂豫皖根据地也有少共团的组织。在共产主义青年团员的带动下，大批青年走上前线，仅仅拥有二百万人口的江西根据地曾经在一个月中有五万人参军，其中大部分为青年。青年团并动员青年积极参加支援前线、拥军、优待红军家属等工作，使自己成为红军的一支英勇的支持力量。
    当时在工农红军中的共产主义青年团则是部队中一切工作和战斗中的一支突击力量。青年团通过部队中群众性的青年组织——青年队团结和教育了广大青年。青年团通过青年队的队课，经常在青年以及青年团员中间进行马列主义教育。当时工农红军经常组织一种突击队，深入敌人后方，担负筹款、收集情报、没收土地分配给农民、发动组织群众，并相机打击敌人。这些突击队都是由最好的共产党员和共产主义青年团员组织的。在长期艰苦的战斗中以及在二万五千里长征中渡越乌江、抢渡大渡河、冲过腊子口等几次有名的战斗中的英雄有很多是青年团员和青年。
    在当时红军的每个连队中都有列宁室（相当于现在的俱乐部），青年团员是主要的参加者与组织者。他们发动全体青年参加列宁室的活动，例如刺枪比赛、防空演习、掷手榴弹、沙盘作业、唱歌、墙报、卫生晚会等。通过这些活动在活跃部队、学习文化和军事技术以及开展卫生运动等方面起了很大作用。唱歌在红军中是非常普遍的，上级有了号召，青年们便编成歌子唱。甚至在过草地吃青稞麦、啃牛皮战斗生活万分艰苦的时候，歌声仍彼伏此起。枪托诗、背包识字、地上识字已是当时红军在文化学习中习用的方法。
    一九三五年十一月，中共中央发布了关于青年工作的决定，确定改变共产主义青年团的组织及其工作方式，以便执行动员组织广大青年为民族解放而奋斗的任务，于是，在国民党统治区产生了中华民族解放先锋队的组织。当时红军部队中的共产主义青年团团员大部分都光荣地加入了共产党。
    八年抗日战争时期
    抗日战争开始以后，几十万青年参加了军队，其中包括大批的中华民族解放先锋队的队员，以及在广州、徐州等地的青年救国团团员和广东的青年抗日先锋队队员，他们都成为部队中青年的骨干。一九三七年在延安召开的第一次青年代表大会，决定在各解放区建立青年救国会，至一九四○年时，各解放区的会员有百余万人。青年救国会在发动青年参军、支援前线、参加民兵及开展各地工作中起了很大作用。一九四○年以后，晋察冀、山东、晋东南等解放区的青年救国会成立了基干的青年武装组织——青年抗日先锋队，配合八路军打击日寇。
    在八路军和新四军部队中的各级政治部都设立了青年工作部门，普遍地建立了青年队的组织。青年队在开辟根据地、坚持敌后战斗以及各种工作中都起了不少作用。
    四年解放战争时期
    在四年人民解放战争中，部队青年在共产党的领导下，英勇地站在人民解放战争的最前线，创造了成千成万的模范射击手、模范炮手、坦克手、爆炸英雄和战斗英雄。这次出席全国战斗英雄代表会议的三百五十名战斗英雄中，在三十岁以下的有二百四十三人，其中十八岁到二十五岁的就有一百一十八人。如像刘四虎、吕顺保、刘奎基、魏来国、郭俊卿、田广文、李广正……等都是著名的年青的战斗英雄。一九四六年十月中共中央提议在各解放区试验建团后，新民主主义青年团在各地陆续建立。青年团员在参军、参战、支援前线方面是一支带头的力量。各地团员首先报名参军，土地改革后分得了土地的青年农民也大批涌入人民解放军。一九四九年中国新民主主义青年团全国第一次代表大会决定在部队试建团的组织。同年七月，中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会和中国人民革命军事委员会（按即现在的中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会）联合发布了关于部队建团的决定，至今年十月，全军已有团员近二十五万人。在剿匪作战、海南岛渡海作战、部队生产和文化学习的各种工作中，青年团员都有辉煌的表现。今后部队青年工作在共产党的领导下，在建立强大的国防军的基础上将有更进一步的开展，而成为在部队中开展爱国主义和革命英雄主义运动的伟大力量。【新华社】
