　　American Imperialism is the Deadly Enemy of the Chinese People, We Firmly Oppose its Expansion of Aggression!
    Xing Zhaokai
    After returning from Beijing, I was welcomed by the people of the whole city. I gave a report at a meeting organized by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and made two broadcasts on the radio. The content was to convey the spirit of the conference and the glorious deeds of the heroic model workers. Recently, American imperialism has expanded its war of aggression against Korea and is extending the flames of war to the borders of our motherland. It vainly attempts to enslave us, the Chinese people. It is our deadly enemy! We firmly oppose American imperialist aggression. Now, in addition to working hard to do my current job well, I am awaiting the call of the motherland.

    我从北京回来之后，受到了全市人民的欢迎。在市总工会组织的大会上作了报告，并在广播电台作了两次广播。内容是传达大会的精神和英雄劳模的光荣事迹。最近美帝扩大侵朝战争，并将战火烧向我们祖国的边疆。它妄想奴役我们中国人民。它是我们的死对头！我们坚决反对美帝侵略。我现在除了努力把现在的工作搞好以外，我等待祖国的号召。
