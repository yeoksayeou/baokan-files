Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, October 24th: Since October 13th, continuous autumn rains have caused river levels to rise simultaneously in parts of Henan Province. The Tulu River in Yancheng and the Yi River in Luoyang have already breached their banks. Many areas are flooded due to accumulated water, causing significant damage to late autumn wheat fields. For example, in Tanghe County, Nanyang Prefecture, approximately 600,000 mu of autumn crops have been flooded, and wheat fields in some areas have not yet been sown due to the rain. In response to this new disaster, the Henan Provincial People's Government immediately issued an urgent directive, instructing people in areas along the rivers to strictly prevent further flooding. Areas with breaches or overflowing water should accelerate efforts to close the gaps, rebuild dikes, or build enclosures to prevent the disaster from expanding. For already flooded autumn crops and wheat seedlings, all efforts should be made to dig ditches and quickly drain the water for rescue. The directive requires all localities to carry out rush planting and replanting of wheat fields, striving to "plant whenever a piece of land is dry" and "replant as much as has been flooded" to maximize the sown area of wheat, in order to avoid continuous famine. The directive also stipulates that emergency relief should be provided to disaster-stricken areas and people according to different circumstances. The Henan Provincial People's Government formally established a Production and Disaster Relief Committee on October 20th to unify the leadership of production and disaster relief work throughout the province.

　　河南部分地方发生新水灾
    省府采取各种措施进行抢救
    【新华社开封二十四日电】河南省部分地方自本月十三日以来秋雨连绵，各河水位同时暴涨，郾城土鲁河及洛阳伊河已发生决口，不少地区更因积水成灾，晚秋麦田受害较重。如南阳专区唐河一县即被淹秋禾田约六十万亩，部分地区麦田因雨尚未播种。当此新灾情发生后，河南省人民政府即发出紧急指示，指示沿河各地人民严防河水再次泛滥；有决口或水势漫溢的地区应加紧进行堵口，复堤或圈堵，防止水患扩大。已被淹的秋禾麦苗应尽一切努力开挖沟渠，迅速排水抢救。指示要求各地突击进行抢种和补种麦田，尽可能作到“干一块，种一块”和“淹多少，补多少”，以争取种麦面积达到最大限度，以免招至连续的灾荒。指示并规定对灾区灾民应根据不同情况进行急赈。河南省人民政府已于本月二十日正式成立生产救灾委员会，以便统一领导全省的生产救灾工作。
