　　Good Harvests Widespread in Rural Southern Xinjiang
    Grain Production Increases by Over 23 Million Jin Compared to Last Year

    [Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 12th] Good harvests are being universally celebrated in rural areas across southern Xinjiang Province, with farmers of all ethnicities happily engaged in harvesting. According to incomplete statistics from thirty counties under the jurisdiction of the four special districts of Kashgar, Aksu, Shache, and Hotan in southern Xinjiang, the six million mu of autumn fields sown this year are expected to yield 110 million jin more of autumn grains such as rice and corn compared to last year. Adding the 90 million jin of wheat produced in excess of last year from the three million mu of wheat fields sown in the summer, plus the 33.36 million jin of grain produced from newly cultivated land by farmers and the People's Liberation Army, southern Xinjiang will produce at least 233.36 million jin more grain this year compared to last year.
    Southern Xinjiang is an important agricultural reclamation area of Xinjiang Province. The good harvest in southern Xinjiang is of great significance for the food supply problem in Xinjiang. Southern Xinjiang has no rain all year round, and agriculture mainly depends on irrigation. Therefore, the People's Government this year assisted farmers in rationally regulating water use, which greatly increased farmers' enthusiasm for production, and this is the main reason for obtaining a good harvest. This year, the People's Government not only led farmers of all ethnic groups in vigorously repairing and building new canals, dikes, dams, and reservoirs to expand water sources, but also established water conservancy committees at the special district, county, district, and township levels to uniformly and rationally distribute water, so that the land of poor farmers also received the same irrigation this year. In addition, under the advocacy of the People's Government and the influence of the People's Liberation Army, farmers of various ethnic groups such as the Uyghurs have also made great improvements in farming techniques this year.

　　南疆农村普遍丰收
    较去年增产粮食两亿余万斤
    【新华社西安十二日电】新疆省南部各地农村普庆丰收，各族农民正在欢欣地进行收割。据南疆喀什、阿克苏、莎车、和阗四个专区所属三十个县的不完全统计，今年播种的六百万亩秋田，可比去年增产稻子、玉蜀黍等秋粮一亿一千万斤。加上今年夏季三百万亩麦田比去年多产的九千万斤小麦，再加上农民和人民解放军新垦荒地所生产的三千三百六十万斤粮食，今年南疆至少要比去年增产两亿三千三百六十万斤粮食。
    南疆为新疆省的重要的农垦区，南疆丰收对新疆民食问题意义极为重大。南疆各地终年不雨，农业主要依靠灌溉。因此，人民政府今年协助农民，合理地调剂了农民用水问题，并由此而提高了农民的生产积极性，为获得丰收的主要原因。今年人民政府不仅领导各族农民大力修理和新建水渠、堤霸、水闸、水库，扩大了水源，并建立了专区、县、区、乡各级的水利委员会，统一地合理地分配用水，使今年贫苦农民的土地也获得了同样的灌溉。此外，在人民政府倡导和人民解放军的影响下，维吾尔等各民族农民今年在耕作技术上也有很大的改进。
