Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 5th -- As a result of state-owned trading companies' large-scale purchasing of local products and promoting industrial goods, Renminbi has begun to circulate in ethnically mixed areas of Gansu Province, such as Linxia, Yongdeng, Minxian, and Xiahe. In the past, due to the devaluation of Kuomintang fake currency, the people of all ethnic groups in the above-mentioned areas suffered greatly, so most market transactions used silver dollars or were conducted through barter. In the early days of liberation, the people of various counties were also suspicious of Renminbi. However, in the past six months, through trading companies purchasing local products at reasonable prices and promoting industrial necessities, Renminbi gradually flowed to the countryside, and its credibility became increasingly consolidated. For example, Linxia is a market where silver dollars are concentrated in the province. According to the statistics of the trading company's turnover of purchasing native products such as fur, medicinal materials, and hog bristles in the past six months (January to June), more than 500 million yuan in Renminbi has remained in the countryside. In the past, many silver dollars were also circulated in Yongdeng County. Now, many farmers are happy to bring back Renminbi when they enter the city to sell grain. The phenomenon that farmers and vendors near Lanzhou city used to scramble to buy silver dollars has completely stopped. Tibetan people in Xiahe, the trading center of the Tibetan area, and its nearby thirteen market towns, also felt that it was more convenient and not disadvantageous to use Renminbi than to exchange goods for goods, so they also began to trust Renminbi. Many Tibetan merchants deposited their income in Renminbi into the bank, so the deposit figures of Xiahe People's Bank increased every month.
　　Now, in order to enable Renminbi to penetrate into the countryside, Gansu Provincial Trading Company is preparing to focus on helping cooperatives and merchants to carry out trade in major towns and villages in minority areas.

　　甘肃民族杂居地区
    人民币开始流通
    【新华社西安五日电】经过国营贸易公司大量收购土产和推销工业品的结果，人民币已开始在甘肃省各民族杂居区如临夏、永登、岷县、夏河等地通行。上述地区过去因受国民党伪币贬值的影响，各民族人民吃亏很大，因此市场交易大都使用银元或实行物物交换；解放初期各县人民对人民币也同样抱怀疑态度。但半年来经过贸易公司用合理价格收购土产，推销工业必需品，人民币逐渐流向农村，信用日益巩固。如临夏为该省银元集中的市场，据贸易公司在过去半年中（一至六月份）收购皮毛、药材、猪鬃等土产的成交量统计，已有人民币五亿多元留在农村。永登县过去也多流通银元，现在许多农民进城粜粮，都乐意带回人民币。兰州市附近乡镇的农民和商贩过去争购银洋的现象已完全停止。藏区贸易中心的夏河及其附近十三个集市的藏民们，也感觉到用人民币比货换货计算便利而又不吃亏，因此也开始信任人民币。不少藏族商民都将收入的人民币存入银行，因此夏河人民银行的存款数字每月都有增加。
    现甘肃省贸易公司为了使人民币深入农村，正在准备重点帮助合作社与商贩在少数民族区的大市镇及乡村开展贸易。
