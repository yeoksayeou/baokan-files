　　Criticism in Shanghai Newspapers
　　At the First Session of the Second Shanghai Municipal People's Congress, Comrade Xia Yan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture, made a report entitled "Overview of Shanghai's Cultural and Educational Work and Future Tasks." The report made the following assessment of the criticism and self-criticism work carried out by Shanghai's newspapers:
　　"The newspapers and periodicals have played a significant role in reporting government work and promoting policies. In particular, since April this year, in accordance with the Municipal Government's 'Instructions on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications,' a broad campaign of criticism and self-criticism has been launched, mobilizing the people of the city to inspect, supervise, criticize, and correct the work and style of work of Shanghai's work and work cadres, which has achieved good results. In the past six months, a total of more than 5,000 opinions from the masses have been received, of which more than 2,000 have helped our work and further exchanged information and opinions between the government's upper and lower levels and between the government and the people."
　　The report mentioned that the main task of the Shanghai News and Publishing Bureau in the next period is to "summarize the experience of the previous period of criticism and self-criticism movement, and further carry out mass criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications under leadership, strengthen people's unity, and improve work."
　　Regarding broadcasting work, the report stated: "In addition to enriching and improving the work of the Shanghai People's Radio Station and providing political and artistic programs to the people of Shanghai, especially the working masses, we have begun to organize city-wide worker broadcasting stations to carry out mass broadcasting work."
　　Progress in Criticism Work at the Yangtze Daily
　　According to the October 18th editorial of the Yangtze Daily, "Further Develop Criticism and Self-Criticism," the criticism work of the Yangtze Daily made great progress in September compared to August. The number of critical and suggestive submissions and letters received by the Mass Garden group was 108 in August and increased to 350 in September; after these submissions and letters were processed, only 35 were responded to in August, accounting for 32.4% of the total, while in September, 191 were responded to, accounting for 54.53% of the total. The editorial specifically pointed out: "The leading organs of the Party and the government, especially the Party's Discipline Inspection Committee and the government's supervisory organs, have attached importance to and supported the criticism of the masses, which has played a great role in promoting open criticism and self-criticism, thus making the work of self-criticism receive great results. The spirit of Comrade Li Xiannian, Chairman of Hubei Province and Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in supporting and caring about the newspaper's development of criticism work is worth learning from in various regions."
　　The editorial also reviewed the main shortcomings in the work, namely, on the one hand, the newspaper's criticism was still somewhat piecemeal, sometimes only "hunting" for shortcomings in isolation, and sometimes limited to negative exposure, etc., and on the other hand, some organizations or individuals still lacked the spirit of humbly accepting critical opinions. In order to overcome these shortcomings, the editorial pointed out: "The fundamental problem is to carry out repeated and systematic education work for cadres (and also for the masses), eliminate ideological obstacles, and make every revolutionary worker develop a style and habit, so that criticism and self-criticism become an indispensable part of work and daily life. Moreover, it is necessary to correctly grasp the principles, purposes, and methods of criticism, and prevent formalism and vulgarization of criticism and self-criticism."
　　Be Vigilant Against Destructive Criticism
　　On September 26, the Chongqing Xinhua Daily publicly exposed in the newspaper a conspiracy by bad elements to use the newspaper to undermine the prestige of the People's Government.
　　The fact is this: Ren Yuquan, a "local lawyer" (a litigation trickster who handles lawsuits) in Wanxian, Sichuan, who lived by extortion, forged receipts and falsely accused merchants in an attempt to defraud money. After investigation by the Wanxian People's Court, his conspiracy was exposed and he was sentenced to one month of detention. His son, Ren Tianhui, using the pseudonym "Ren Jili," submitted a letter to the Wanxian Daily, falsely accusing the staff of the Wanxian People's Court who handled the case of "bureaucratic style" and "violating laws and regulations." The Wanxian Daily sent reporters to investigate and understand the actual situation, and the letter was not published. After Ren Tianhui's first attempt to spread rumors and slander failed, he successively submitted letters to the Chongqing Xinhua Daily and the Wanxian Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China under assumed names. In addition to accusing the Wanxian People's Court, he also said that the Wanxian Daily "evaded and delayed" and "did not value the opinions of the masses." The Chongqing Xinhua Daily published the facts of Ren Tianhui's attempt to use newspaper criticism for destructive activities and gave it a merciless exposure, finally smashing his conspiracy. In the process of vigorously developing criticism and self-criticism in newspapers, it is very necessary to strengthen vigilance and not allow these bad elements to take advantage of loopholes.
　　Suiyuan Wudong County Launches Reading Group Movement Month
　　On October 16, the Suiyuan Daily published four letters about reading groups, one of which was a communication from the Propaganda Department of the Wudong County Committee on issuing instructions on launching a reading group movement month.
　　There are more than 20 reading groups in Wudong County, of which only the reading groups in three villages are organized, have systems, and regularly reflect the situation; the rest "just gather the whole village together to read for a while and discuss for a while during slack farming seasons, without a fixed system, and collapse when farming gets busy. More commonly, village cadres see the newspaper but the masses do not, and some villages cannot find a place to subscribe to the newspaper, and the newspaper fees are transferred around and lost." This has created a phenomenon where "the masses of the county urgently demand to read the newspaper, but there are few formal reading groups."
　　Therefore, the Propaganda Department of the Wudong County Committee decided to universally call for the establishment of reading groups through the autumn tax collection, made arrangements for organizing reading groups at the county, district, and village cadre expansion meetings, and issued instructions on launching a reading group movement month. The instructions stipulate: "October is designated as the reading group movement month, and each administrative village is required to organize at least one reading group. Whether they are district or village cadres or comrades working in the countryside, they are all responsible for organizing. First of all, it is necessary to explain the content of the newspaper to the masses, and correctly absorb the opinions of the masses. Mobilize primary school teachers, village secretaries, and immigrants to participate in the reading groups as the backbone of the readers and reading groups. At the beginning of the establishment, the main focus should be on organized masses such as village cadres, Party members, League members, and militia, and drive the masses to participate through them, gradually expanding the impact. Where there are people's schools, they should be combined with the people's schools as much as possible. Strictly prevent 'coercive' organizational methods. The reading methods should be as flexible as possible to meet the needs of the masses, combined with mass activities, and selective reading. Generally, the time should be half an hour for reading and half an hour for discussion. And should regularly reflect opinions to the newspaper."

    上海报纸上的批评
    在上海市二届一次人民代表会议上，上海市文化局长夏衍同志作了《上海文教工作概况与今后工作任务》的报告，报告中对于上海各报展开批评和自我批评工作的情形作了如下的估计：
    “各报刊对于政府工作的报道，政策的宣传，都起了很大的作用。特别是今年四月以后，各报刊根据市府‘在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的指示’，广泛展开了批评与自我批评运动，发动全市人民检查、监督、批评、纠正上海市的工作与工作干部的作风，收到较好的效果。半年以来，总结收到群众意见五千余件，其中二千余件已使我们的工作得到帮助，并使政府的上下级之间、政府与人民之间的情况与意见，得到进一步的交流。”
    在报告中说到上海新闻出版处今后一个时期的主要工作时，并说明要“总结前一时期批评与自我批评运动的经验，有领导地进一步在报纸刊物上展开群众性的批评与自我批评，加强人民团结，改进工作。”
    在广播工作方面，报告中说：“除了充实和改善上海人民电台的工作，对上海人民特别是上海工人大众供给政治性的和艺术性的节目之外，我们开始组织全市工人广播站，开展群众性的广播工作。”
    长江日报批评工作的进步
    长江日报的批评工作，据该报十月十八日社论《进一步开展批评与自我批评》中的报告，九月份比八月份有了很大的进步。大众园地组收到的批评建议性的来稿和来信，八月份是一百零八件，九月份增加到了三百五十件；这些稿件和信件经过处理后，得到了答复的八月份只有三十五件，占全部的百分之三十二·四，九月份则有一百九十一件，占全部的百分之五十四·五三。社论中特别指出：“党的和政府的领导机关，特别是党的纪律检查委员会和政府的监察机关，重视与支持了群众的批评，这对于公开地展开批评和自我批评，起了极大的推动作用，因而使自我批评的工作收到了很大的作用。湖北省主席、中共湖北省委书记李先念同志支持和关心报纸开展批评工作的精神，值得各地学习。”
    社论也检讨了工作中的主要缺点，即一方面报纸的批评有些还嫌零碎，有时只是孤立地“猎获”缺点，有时限于消极揭露等，另一方面则是仍有一些机关或个人缺少虚心接受批评意见的精神。为了克服这些缺点，社论指出：“根本的问题还是对干部（也要对群众）进行反复系统的教育工作，扫除思想障碍，使每一个革命工作人员养成一种风气和习惯，使批评和自我批评成为工作和日常生活中不可缺少的一部分内容。而且要正确掌握批评的原则、目的和方法，防止批评和自我批评的形式主义化和庸俗化。
    警惕破坏性的批评
    重庆新华日报九月二十六日在报纸上公开揭穿了一件坏分子企图利用报纸破坏人民政府威信的阴谋。
    事实是这样的：四川万县一个以敲诈为生的“土律师”（包揽词讼的讼棍）任玉泉，伪造单据，诬告商家，企图诈财行骗，经万县人民法院调查，识破其阴谋，判处一月拘役。其子任天惠假名“任济黎”投书万县日报，诬蔑万县人民法院处理这一案件的工作人员“官僚作风”，“违法乱纪”，万县日报派记者调查，了解了实际情况后，投书未予发表。任天惠在一次造谣诬蔑失败之后，又先后化名投书重庆新华日报和中共万县地委，除控告万县人民法院之外，并说万县日报“支吾拖延”，“不重视群众意见”。重庆新华日报发表了任天惠企图利用报纸批评进行破坏性活动的事实经过，给予无情的揭发，最后击破了他的阴谋。在报纸大力展开批评和自我批评的过程中，加强警惕，不让这些坏分子钻空子是非常必要的。
    绥远武东县开展读报组运动月
    十月十六日的绥远日报上发表了四篇关于读报组的来信，其中之一是武东县委宣传部发出关于开展读报组运动月指示的通讯。
    武东全县有二十多个读报组，其中只有三个村的读报组有组织、有制度、经常反映情况；其余“不过在农闲时全村群众聚在一块，读一阵讨论一阵，没有一定的制度，到农忙时就垮了。更普遍的是村干部看到报而群众看不上，部分村里找不到订报处，把报费转来转去因而丢失。”形成“全县群众迫切要求看报，但却很少有正规的读报组”的现象。
    因此，武东县委宣传部决定通过秋征普遍号召建立读报组，在县区村扩干会议上作了组织读报组的布置，同时发出开展读报组运动月的指示。指示中规定：以“十月份为读报组运动月，要求每个行政村起码组织一个读报组。无论区村干部或下乡工作同志，都有责任组织。首先要把报纸内容向群众说清，正确的吸取群众意见。动员小学教师、村书记和移民参加读报组，作为读报人和读报组的骨干。开始建立时，主要应以村干部、党团员、民兵等有组织的群众为对象，通过他们带动群众参加，逐渐扩大影响。有民校的地方应该尽量与民校结合。严格防止“强迫命令”的组织方式。读报方法要力求灵活，适合群众需要，结合群众活动，有选择的读。一般时间以读半小时讨论半小时为宜。并应经常向报社反映意见。”
