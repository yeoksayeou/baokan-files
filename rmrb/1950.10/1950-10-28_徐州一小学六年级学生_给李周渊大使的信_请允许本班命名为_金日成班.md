　　Letter from Sixth Graders at a Primary School in Xuzhou
    to Ambassador Li Zhouyuan

   Please Allow Our Class to be Named "Kim Il-sung Class"

Beijing People's Daily, please forward to Ambassador Li Zhouyuan of the Korean Embassy in China:

    We are sixth-grade students from Huancheng Road Primary School in Xuzhou, Shandong Province. We have learned from the newspapers that you are engaged in a just war to defend your country against the enemy invading you—American imperialism and the Li Seung-man bandit gang. We deeply admire your spirit of anti-aggression. We firmly believe that under the leadership of your wise leader, General Kim Il-sung, you will surely achieve the final victory!

    We have great respect for General Kim Il-sung. Now, we request that you convey to General Kim Il-sung our desire to name our class "Kim Il-sung Class." We firmly believe that you will give us a satisfactory reply to this request and be as happy as we are. If you could send us a portrait of the great General Kim Il-sung, we would be even more grateful.

    Now, our entire class has saved up a week's worth of candy money, totaling 6,000 yuan in Renminbi, which we respectfully offer to all the soldiers of the Korean People's Army. The gift is small, but the sentiment is deep. We hope you will forward it on our behalf to express our respect for them.

    With revolutionary respect,

               The entire sixth-grade class of Huancheng Road Primary School, Xuzhou, Shandong Province

　　徐州一小学六年级学生
    给李周渊大使的信         
   请允许本班命名为“金日成班”北京人民日报请转朝鲜驻华大使馆李周渊大使：
    我们是山东省徐州市环城路小学六年级的学生。我们从报纸上知道了你们正和侵略你们的敌人——美帝国主义及李承晚匪帮进行着保卫祖国的正义战争。你们这种反侵略的精神，实在令人钦佩。我们完全相信：在你们英明的领袖金日成将军的领导下，你们一定能取得最后的胜利！
    我们对金日成将军怀着极大的敬仰。现在，我们要求您转达金日成将军，允许我们把我们这个班命名为“金日成班”。我们深信您一定会圆满答复我们这个要求，并和我们一样感到高兴的。如果您能够送给我们一帧伟大的金日成将军的画像，那更是我们所感谢的了。
    现在，我们全班同学积蓄了一个星期日的糖果费人民币六千元，谨献给朝鲜人民军全体战士们。礼薄意深，希您代为转交，以表示我们对他们的敬意。
    此致
    革命敬礼
               山东省徐州市环城路小学六年级全体同学
