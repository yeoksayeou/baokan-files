Short commentary

　　The comprehensive news from Chahar, Shaanxi and other places today illustrates a very important issue. That is, because some regions, in their inspection work, simply reviewed and criticized past mistakes, without analyzing the situation, finding the causes, or formulating methods to overcome them, some district and township cadres developed erroneous ideas such as "rather fail to complete the task than commit the error of commandism," "seek no merit, but seek no demerit," and "removing coercive orders is equivalent to disarming us." Therefore, after returning to their actual work positions, they adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards work, or some people repeated past mistakes and continued to beat and tie up people.

    The reason these phenomena occur is obviously because some regions, although they have inspected work and ideological style, have not truly followed Chairman Mao's instructions and summarized the correct and incorrect parts of the work with a "realistic" attitude, so that cadres can recognize from their own work: what is correct and what is wrong; and replace the erroneous work style with the correct work style, and the erroneous work methods with the correct work methods. Some regions even adopted an attitude of "total negation" to negate everything. Even necessary work instructions, systems, and assigned tasks were considered "commandism." Such inspection work, of course, results in a "pitch-black" and "completely worthless" situation. How can this not make some cadres lose their direction, lose confidence in their work, and feel distressed, dejected, and constrained (of course, it is also possible that some people use this to resist rectification, but not many)?

    Some, after checking out the problems, no longer seriously analyze the situation, find the causes, and determine methods for improvement, but are satisfied with the few "amazing" error facts that are revealed, and then end the rectification.

    Some, although they have set out methods for improving work, are not practical, and only vaguely stipulate some principles that cannot play a role, such as "strengthening the study of policies, strengthening the understanding of the situation, strengthening the inspection of work," and "promoting advantages, overcoming shortcomings, clarifying division of labor, and strictly implementing systems." Strictly speaking, this is a kind of formalism.

    The rectification of cadres in various districts and townships is about to be universally launched. Carrying out inspection and summarization work realistically to improve work is something that rectification agencies in various regions should pay close attention to.

### 必须实事求是地总结工作

　　必须实事求是地总结工作
    从今天察哈尔、陕西等地的整风综合消息中，说明了一个很重要的问题。那就是由于某些地区在检查工作中，单纯地检讨和批评了过去的错误，而未分析情况，找出原因，也未定出克服办法，以致有一部分区乡干部产生了“宁叫任务完不成也不犯命令主义的错误”、“不求有功，但求无过”、“去掉了强迫命令就等于解除了我们的武装”等错误思想。因此，他们回到实际工作岗位之后，即对工作采取了放任自流的态度，或者有些人重复了过去的错误，继续打人、捆人。
    这些现象之所以发生，显然是因为有些地区虽然检查了工作，检查了思想作风，但并未真正按照毛主席所指示的，以“实事求是”的态度来总结出工作中的正确部分，和工作中的错误部分，使干部从自己亲手作的工作中去认识：什么是正确的，什么是错误的；并以正确的工作作风代替错误的工作作风，以正确的工作方法代替错误的工作方法。有些地区竟以“一概否定”的态度来否定一切。连必须的工作指示、制度和规定的任务，都被认为是“命令主义”。这样去检查工作，结果，当然是“漆黑一团”“一无是处”。这怎能不使一部分干部迷失方向、丧失工作信心而苦恼，而垂头丧气，而束手束脚呢（当然也可能有些人用此来抵抗整风的，但是不多。）？
    也有的在检查出问题以后，不再去认真的分析情况、找出原因、定出改进的方法，而是满足于揭发出来的几件“令人惊奇”的错误事实，就此结束整风。
    有的虽然定出了改进工作的办法，但却并不切合实际，只是笼统地规定了一些“加强对政策的研究，加强对情况的了解，加强对工作的检查”和“发扬优点，克服缺点，明确分工，严格制度”等一些起不了什么作用的原则。严格地说，这是一种形式主义的作法。
    各地区乡干部的整风，即将普遍展开，实事求是地进行检查总结工作，以改进工作，实是值得各地领导整风的机构深切加以注意的。
