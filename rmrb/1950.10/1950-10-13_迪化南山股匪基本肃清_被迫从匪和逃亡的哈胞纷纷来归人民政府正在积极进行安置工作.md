　　Dihua Southern Mountain Bandit Suppression Basically Complete
    Kazakh Compatriots Forced into Banditry and those Who Fled Return One After Another; The People's Government is Actively Carrying Out Resettlement Work
    [Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 10th] Under the strenuous efforts of the People's Liberation Army bandit suppression troops, the bandits in the southern mountains of Dihua, Xinjiang, have been basically eliminated. The vast numbers of Kazakh compatriots who were forced into banditry and those who fled, after thorough propaganda by the work teams organized by the Dihua County People's Government and the CPC Party Committee, have successively abandoned the bandits and returned one after another. Since mid-August, more than 1,000 yurts have returned to their homeland to settle down (note that this area is a nomadic region). The work teams are actively carrying out resettlement work. The first batch of 695 households, totaling more than 3,700 people, and more than 55,000 head of livestock have been resettled, and pastures have been temporarily allocated and adjusted.

    【新华社迪化十日电】在人民解放军剿匪部队努力进剿下，新疆迪化南山股匪已基本肃清。被迫从匪和逃亡的广大哈萨克族同胞，经迪化县人民政府和中共党委会所组织的工作组深入宣传后，均先后脱离匪徒纷纷来归。计自八月中旬以来，已有一千余顶房子回籍安生（按该地为游牧地区）。工作组正积极进行安置工作。首批归来的六百九十五户三千七百余人及五万五千余头牲畜均已安置完毕，并临时分配和调剂了草场。
