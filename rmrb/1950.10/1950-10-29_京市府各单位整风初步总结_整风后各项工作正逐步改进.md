Beijing News Agency report: The rectification movement in units under the Beijing Municipal People's Government is deepening. As of October 27, eighteen units, including the Labor Bureau, Land Administration Bureau, Bureau of Culture and Education, Bureau of Industry, Tax Bureau, Finance Bureau, People's Court, Cooperative Headquarters, Public Health Bureau, Enterprise Company, and the public offices of the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Districts, have made preliminary summaries. They are now conducting formal summaries by discussing Zhang Youyu's (Deputy Mayor) preliminary summary report among all cadres.

The rectification of each unit is carried out "under the condition of being closely integrated with various work tasks rather than separated from them." In order to implement the purpose of summarizing and improving work, the Municipal Government and its subordinate units have been summarizing and improving work simultaneously during the rectification process. In addition to improving the meeting system and formulating some necessary work regulations, the Municipal Government itself has also adjusted its organizational structure, such as deciding to: add a Deputy Secretary-General and establish a district administration group to guide district administration; abolish the Reception Office and add a Reception Section within the Administrative Office; reorganize the Amateur Education Committee and add a Workers and Peasants Education Section within the Bureau of Culture and Education, etc. The work of the units under the Municipal Government has also been improved. For example, the Bureau of Industry clarified the division of labor between departments and offices during the rectification, handled affairs according to regulations, and overcame the past phenomenon of grasping everything indiscriminately. At the same time, the idea that the formulation of plans must rely on the masses was further clarified. In the past, the bureau generally did not notify the content of meetings in advance, and the preparation work was not done well, so that the meetings could not solve any problems. After everyone raised opinions, it was immediately improved. During the rectification period, the Land Administration Bureau cleared up more than 1,000 backlogged cases, which boosted the morale of cadres, who launched work competitions one after another. In the past, surveying averaged 33 rooms per person per day, but now it has increased to 66 rooms, and a mass inspection work has been preliminarily established. In the process of this rectification, the People's Court, in addition to conducting a comprehensive and in-depth review of the implementation of policies, also simplified procedures such as receipts and expenditures, and archiving. Other units have also formulated some specific plans, improved work methods, and adjusted organizational structures in the process of summarizing work.

In the municipal government system, there are still some middle and lower-level cadres who do not have high confidence in the rectification, and the integration of the Party and the administration in the rectification work is not close enough. In order to solve these problems, the Municipal Government convened a joint meeting of administrative leaders and CCP Party branch secretaries. At the meeting, Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu emphasized that the content of the summary should be specific, the work should be accurately estimated, methods for improving the work must be proposed, and specific problems in the work must be solved. The work summary of general units must concentrate efforts to make the final summary by the end of October. He pointed out that the view that individual cadres must solve all problems in this summary work is also incorrect; some trivial issues such as details of life, unprincipled disputes, etc., should be resolved separately. He hoped that the Party branch would actively and closely integrate with the administration, and the administration should also rely on the organizational strength of the Party to do a good job in this rectification movement together.

　　京市府各单位整风初步总结
    整风后各项工作正逐步改进
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处消息：北京市人民政府所属各单位的整风运动正在深入开展中。截至本月二十七日止，已有劳动局、地政局、文教局、工业局、税务局、财政局、人民法院、合作总社、公共卫生局、企业公司和第一、第二、第三、第四、第五、第六、第七、第九区区公所等十八个单位作出了初步总结，并正结合张友渔副市长初步总结报告，在全体干部中展开讨论，进行正式总结。
    各单位的整风，都是“在和各项工作任务密切地相结合而不是相分离的条件之下”进行的。为贯彻总结与改善工作的目的，市府与所属各单位在整风过程中，曾一面总结工作，一面改进工作。市府本身除改善了会议制度，制订了一些必要的工作条例外，并调整了组织机构，如决定：增设副秘书长一人，并设立指导区政的区政组；取消交际处，在行政处内增设交际科；改组业余教育委员会，在文教局内增设工农教育处等。市府所属各单位的工作也已有所改进。如工业局在整风中明确了各科、室的分工，按规定办事，克服了过去乱抓的现象。同时，更进一步明确了制订计划必须依靠群众的思想。该局过去开会，一般事先都不通知内容，准备工作做得不好，以致会议不能解决什么问题，经过大家提出意见，即行改善。地政局在整风期间，清理了一千多件积压的案件，干部工作情绪因而高涨，纷纷展开工作竞赛；以往测图，一人一天平均作三十三间，现已提高到六十六间，并初步建立起群众性的检查工作。人民法院在这次整风过程中，除对执行政策方针的情况作了全面、深入的检讨外，并简化了收支、归档等手续。其他单位也都在总结工作过程中拟订了一些具体计划，改进工作方法和调整组织机构。
    在市府系统中，目前仍有某些中、下级干部对整风信心不高，以及党与行政在整风工作中结合不够密切的现象。为解决这些问题，市府曾召开了行政首长与中共党支部书记联席会议。会上，张友渔副市长着重指出：总结工作内容要具体，对工作要有确切的估计，必须提出改善工作的办法，解决工作中的具体问题。一般单位总结工作，必须集中力量争取于十月底作出最后总结。他指出，个别干部认为对一切问题都必须在这次总结工作中解决的看法，也是不对的；一些生活细节，无原则的纠纷等等琐碎问题，要另外解决。他希望党支部主动地与行政紧密结合，行政上也要依靠党的组织力量，共同把这次整风运动作好。
