　　Mongolian Youth and the Broad Masses
    Oppose American Aggression Against Korea and Taiwan!
    —Interview with Mongolian Representative Nadru Taozhi

    When talking with the reporter, Nadru Taozhi, the Mongolian representative of the World Federation of Democratic Youth Delegation, first asked the reporter to tell all Chinese youth that the people and youth of the Mongolian People's Republic are following every victory and achievement of the Chinese people with great enthusiasm and importance.

    Nadru Taozhi said: "Mongolian youth are working hard to defend world peace. They are enthusiastically participating in the peace signature campaign."

    "Since the Stockholm Conference of the World Peace Congress initiated the peace signature requesting the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons, the people of the Mongolian People's Republic have enthusiastically participated in the peace signature. Among the one million people in Mongolia, 700,000 have already signed. The youth have played an active role in the signature. They organize peace rallies everywhere, mobilizing the masses to participate in the peace signature. In their speeches to the masses, they not only expressed their determination to defend peace, but also resolutely protested against American imperialism's aggression against Korea and interference in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan; opposed the use of atomic weapons; In order to express the anger of the entire Mongolian people at the American imperialists' open and expanded acts of aggression in Asia, Marshal Choibalsan, the leader of our people, has sent a telegram to the United Nations Security Council, expressing our country's firm opposition to the American armed intervention. This is our attitude."

    "The Mongolian people are realizing Choibalsan's Five-Year Construction Plan, and great achievements have been seen in animal husbandry, industry, and culture. Our lives have improved year by year. Now each household has 130 cattle and sheep, and more than 62 percent of school-age children are literate. The Choibalsan Five-Year Plan will lead us to a happy and beautiful socialist society. Now, the great New China has won, and Korea and Vietnam have also achieved great victories in the battles. You will soon build a happy new society. In this way, the Soviet Union, China, Mongolia, Korea, and Vietnam all have peaceful borders and are connected into one piece. This is the unbreakable fortress of peace in the East!"

　　蒙古青年和广大群众
    反对美国侵略朝鲜台湾！
    ——访问蒙古代表那卓道之
    世界民主青联代表团蒙古代表那卓道之，在和记者谈话的时候，首先即要求记者告诉全中国青年，蒙古人民共和国的人民和青年以巨大的热情关怀着并且重视着中国人民的每一次胜利和每一个成就。
    那卓道之说：“蒙古青年为着保卫世界和平正努力地奋斗着。他们热烈地参加和平签名运动。”
    “自从世界保卫和平大会斯德哥尔摩会议发起要求禁止使用原子武器的和平签名后，蒙古人民共和国的人民就热烈地参加和平签名。全蒙古一百万人民中，已经有七十万人签了名。青年们在签名中是起了积极作用。他们到处组织保卫和平的集会，动员群众参加和平签名。在对群众讲话中，他们不仅表示了自己保卫和平的决心，并坚决地抗议美帝国主义侵略朝鲜和干涉中国人民解放台湾；反对使用原子武器；为了表示全蒙古人民对美帝国主义在亚洲的公开的扩大的侵略行动的愤怒，我国人民领袖乔巴山元帅已经去电给联合国安理会，表示我国坚决反对美国武装干涉的行动。这就是我们的态度。”
    “蒙古人民正在实现着乔巴山的五年建设计划，在牧畜、工业、文化各方面，都已经看到了很大的成绩。我们的生活，一年年的提高了，现在一户人家都有一百三十头牛羊，学龄儿童有百分之六十二以上都识字了。乔巴山五年计划将会把我们引向幸福美丽的社会主义社会去。现在，伟大的新中国胜利了，朝鲜、越南，也在战斗中得到很大胜利，你们都要很快的建设起幸福的新社会来。这样苏联、中国、蒙古、朝鲜、越南都具有了和平的边疆，连成一片这就是东方牢不可破的和平堡垒！”
