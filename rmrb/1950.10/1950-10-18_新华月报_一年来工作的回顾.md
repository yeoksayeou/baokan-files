　　A Review of "New China Monthly" Work Over the Past Year
    Wang Ziye
    “New China Monthly” was born with the birth of New China. As stated in our inaugural address, “Its task will be to record the history of the people of New China.” Let's first examine how well this task has been accomplished.

    Our manuscripts mainly come from newspapers and periodicals across the country. According to our rough survey, there are approximately 430 kinds of newspapers and 250 kinds of magazines in the country, totaling more than 680 kinds. We regularly select from about 150 kinds of magazines and 50 kinds of newspapers, totaling more than 200 kinds (excluding foreign newspapers and periodicals).

    The task of our editorial work is to select good manuscripts. Doing this work well not only helps organizations, groups, schools, and cadres to study, but also saves future historians a lot of trouble. With a copy of "New China Monthly," they don't have to rummage through vast amounts of original materials.

    The selection criteria for "New China Monthly" roughly focus on three aspects: (1) from the perspective of political significance and historical value; (2) representative opinions; (3) materials with reference value. With so many manuscripts, it is not enough to rely solely on the strength of our editorial department to select them appropriately. We must rely on the masses and follow the mass line. This requires establishing contact with relevant government departments, mass organizations, newspaper and magazine publishers, as well as authors and readers, to consult them, solicit their opinions, and invite them to recommend manuscripts.

    Our attitude towards handling manuscripts is basically serious. Experience has shown that articles published in newspapers and periodicals may still reveal problems later. Therefore, we treat every manuscript selected as a new, unpublished manuscript. If problems are discovered, we immediately inquire with the original publisher or author, asking them to respond or revise.

    The work of comprehensive reporting, compression, and rewriting has been gradually strengthened. This is especially evident when comparing the inaugural issue with the latest issue. Even so, it is still not done well enough. We try our best to obtain the consent of the original author after compressing more important articles. Materials selected by "New China Monthly" have a certain impact. For example, the Chinese People's Literature Series recently published a collection of short stories from 1949, "Forward Forever," which contains a total of twelve articles, six of which were selected by "New China Monthly."

    Readers are concerned about "New China Monthly." Every mistake, even an inaccurate translation of the title of a cartoon, prompts them to send us letters. In an article about the fifth anniversary of Hungary's liberation in the April issue, "taking the road to socialism through democracy" was mistakenly printed as "taking the road to imperialism," and "the working people have gradually gained the power to govern the country" was mistakenly printed as "the power to govern the country has been abolished." We received more than a dozen letters of criticism from readers. In general, the main reactions of readers to "New China Monthly" can be summarized into two points: (1) the content is rich, but they want it to be even richer; (2) the price is too expensive, and they cannot afford it. Some readers save their allowance to buy it, while others borrow money to buy it, which is very touching. In order to take care of the readers' purchasing power, we reduced the basic price from twenty yuan to fourteen yuan from the eighth issue onwards, and we plan to work hard to reduce it further in the future.

    "New China Monthly" started with a circulation of 5,000 copies, and then increased to 10,000 copies and 23,000 copies. From the twelfth issue, it was increased to 31,000 copies. "New China Monthly" is not only welcomed by domestic readers, but many overseas Chinese also hope to subscribe. Unfortunately, there are restrictions on foreign exchange and postage, so overseas distribution is currently difficult.

    Since its inception, "New China Monthly" has generally been published on time. This is because the process of issuing manuscripts has a relatively scientific organization. For each issue, we have established a compilation and proofreading schedule with the factory, specifying the dates for issuing the first batch, the second batch, proofreading, and issuing sample books.

    To run a large-scale, informative, and comprehensive magazine like "New China Monthly," it is necessary to have a relatively complete and well-ordered documentation center. Over the past year, we have established a documentation center that is roughly complete. We have no experience in documentation work. After a year of exploration, we have come to two basic experiences: (1) the selection of materials must be precise; (2) the procedures for accessing materials must be simple. There is an infinite amount of material. If we do not define a scope and try to collect everything, it will result in a waste of manpower. To simplify the procedures for accessing materials, there must be a reasonable classification method. If the classification is too rough, it is difficult to find, and if it is too detailed, it is not easy to use. Sometimes, once a piece of information is classified, it is not known where to find it later; it can be put in, but not taken out. We have now learned that the method of organizing materials should be from coarse to fine, first coarse classification, then fine classification. We call it the cell division method.

    Speaking of the shortcomings of "New China Monthly," the main one is that the coverage is not broad enough. In the past, news from Xinhua News Agency and People's Daily, policy documents, and reports and papers by leaders accounted for more than 60% of each issue, while materials from other newspapers and periodicals accounted for less than 40%. After improvements, the capacity for materials from other newspapers and periodicals has increased to 50%. However, the reflection of local typical experiences and the specific lives of the masses is still insufficient. There are also shortcomings in the reflection of opinions. It is correct to include reports, speeches, papers, and government decrees and instructions from Party and government leaders as much as possible, but the opinions of people from all walks of life are not reflected enough. In general, articles on international issues only focus on selecting those from the Soviet Union, and pay less attention to selecting those from our own country. This is also a bias. Based on the above situation, our magazine looks stable and does not make big mistakes, but on the other hand, it shows a shortcoming, that is, the political level is not high enough, and the combat effectiveness and guiding nature are not strong.

    The work of contacting the masses is not done regularly enough. We once issued a general questionnaire to solicit opinions, and the literature and art column sent more than 100 letters to literature and art groups and magazine publishers in various places, but we have not done such work regularly since then. Readers' recommendations of manuscripts and suggestions to us are still only occasional and spontaneous, and have not been well organized.

    Our commissioned manuscripts are frequent, but naturally there is nothing to be proud of, and there is still a considerable distance from our ideals. Commissioned manuscripts have occasionally been published, but they have not been well organized. Objective reasons certainly exist, but insufficient subjective effort is also a fact. Secondly, technical oversights and errors have not been completely eliminated to this day. "There are no big mistakes, but small mistakes are constantly made." There are always a few corrections in the editor's notes of each issue.

　　“新华月报”一年来工作的回顾
    王子野
    “新华月报”是随着新中国的诞生而诞生的，在我们的发刊词上说：“它的任务将是纪录新中国人民的历史。”首先来检查一下这个任务完成得怎么样。
    我们的稿源主要是取自全国的报刊。据我们粗略的调查，全国各种报纸约四百三十种，杂志二百五十种，合共六百八十余种。我们经常选用的杂志约一百五十种，报纸五十种，合共二百余种（国外的报刊不在内）。
    我们的编辑工作的任务是如何选择好稿子。这件工作做好了不仅对机关、团体、学校和干部学习有帮助，而且对将来写历史的人也省去许多麻烦，他们有了一份“新华月报”就无须去翻寻浩如烟海的原始资料。
    “新华月报”选稿的标准大致注意三方面：（１）从政治意义和历史价值着眼；（２）有代表性的言论；（３）有参考价值的资料。稿子那么多，要挑得精当，光靠我们编辑部的力量是不够的，必须依靠群众，走群众路线。这就需要和政府各有关部门、各群众团体、各报纸杂志社以及作者读者建立联系，向他们请教，征求他们的意见，请他们推荐稿件。
    我们处理稿件上的态度基本上是严肃的。经验证明，报刊上发表过的文章事后也可能发现问题，所以我们选登的每篇稿子都当作未发表过的新稿处理，发现问题立即询问原发表者或原作者，请他们答复或修改。
    综合报道、压缩改写的工作已逐渐加强，拿创刊号和最新的一期比在一起特别看得明显。虽然这样，还是做得不够。较重要的文章经我们压缩之后尽可能取得原作者的同意。经“新华月报”选登的材料是有一定影响的。例如中国人民文艺丛书最近出了一本一九四九年的短篇选集“永远前进”，一共有十二篇，其中有六篇都是“新华月报”选登过的。
    读者对“新华月报”是关心的，每一点错误，甚至一幅漫画的标题译得不确切，都给我们来信。四月号上关于匈牙利解放五周年的一篇论文内曾经把“经由民主的道路走向社会主义”误植为“走向帝国主义”，把“劳动人民已逐渐取得了治理国家的权力”误植为“取消了治理国家的权力”，先后收到读者的批评信达十数封之多。一般读者对“新华月报”的反应归纳起来最主要的有两点：（１）内容丰富，要求更丰富些；（２）定价贵，买不起。有的读者节省下津贴费来买，有的借钱来买，这是非常令人感动的。为了照顾读者的购买力，我们从第八期起把基本定价由二十元降低到十四元，以后还准备努力再减低。
    “新华月报”开始发行五千份，以后增加到一万份，二万三千份，从十二期起增印到三万一千份。“新华月报”不仅受到国内读者的欢迎，海外侨胞很多希望订阅，可惜外汇邮寄都有限制，所以目前海外发行还有困难。
    “新华月报”自创刊以来大都能按时出版，这是由于发稿的过程有比较科学的组织，每期发稿都和工厂订立编校程序表，那天发第一批，那天发第二批，那天看清样，那天出样书都按程序办事。
    要办象“新华月报”这样大型的资料性、综合性的杂志，非有一个较完备、较有秩序的资料室不可。一年来我们已建立了一个粗具规模的资料室。资料工作我们都没有经验，经过一年的摸索得出了两条基本经验：（１）选取材料要精；（２）取用手续要简。材料是无限多的，如果不确定一个范围，什么都要，结果反造成人力的浪费。取用手续要做到简便，必须要有合理的分类法。分类分的太粗不好查，分得太琐细也不好用，有时一份资料归了类，以后不知从那里去找，放得进去，抽不出来。我们现在学会了整理资料的方法应当是从粗到细，先粗分，后细分，我们叫它细胞分裂法。
    谈到“新华月报”的缺点主要是反映的面不够宽广。过去每期刊登新华社、人民日报稿件，政策文件，首长的论文报告等约占百分之六十以上，采用其他报刊材料不到百分之四十，经过改进，对其他报刊材料的容纳量增加到百分之五十。但对地方性的典型经验、群众的具体生活情况的反映还不够。言论的反映也有缺陷，尽量收入党政首长的报告、讲话、论文、政府的法令指示是正确的，但对各界民主人士的言论反映得不够。一般国际问题的论著只着重选苏联的，不太注意选本国的，这也是一个偏向。基于以上的情况，我们的杂志看起来平平稳稳，不出大错，但另一方面却表现了一个缺点，这就是政治水平不够高，战斗性和指导性不强。
    联系群众的工作还做得不经常。曾经发过一次普遍的征求意见表，文艺栏曾向各地文艺团体、杂志社发过一百多封信，以后就没有经常做这样的工作。读者向我们推荐稿件，提意见还只是偶然的，自发的，没有很好加以组织。
    我们的特约稿是经常有的，自然说不上什么成绩，就和我们的理想也有相当距离。特约稿偶然也登载过一些，但还未能好好地组织起来。客观原因固然存在，主观努力不够也是事实。其次在技术方面的疏忽差错至今还没有完全消灭。“大错没有，小错不断”，更正声明每期的编后语里总有几条。
