Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 19th. The rectification movement in the first-level organs of the Northwest Administrative Region, which lasted for four months, has now basically concluded.

The rectification campaign in the entire region was launched on the basis of opposing corruption, waste, and other undesirable tendencies this spring, with the main focus on opposing bureaucracy in leadership work. This rectification was closely integrated with work inspection, and through the investigation of one or several major problems, it was linked to the examination of the ideological style and work systems of leaders and general cadres. This has led to a general improvement in the ideological level of cadres, greater unity among cadres, a significant reduction in bureaucracy, and the start of improvements in the work of most organs.

At the beginning of the rectification, all organs carried out relatively thorough mobilization, and some organs promptly resolved some problems that could be resolved, and promptly explained the reasons for those that could not be resolved. This dispelled the negative attitudes of some cadres, and the atmosphere of inspection, criticism of shortcomings, and exposure of problems gradually spread. Subsequently, each organ, based on the problems that were exposed, selected one or several major tasks among them for focused inspection. During the inspection, it was necessary to link the reasons for achievements and shortcomings to the problems existing in the implementation of policies and guidelines, as well as various aspects of ideological style, work methods, and work systems, and conduct a comprehensive and specific analysis. Most organs followed this method, and generally formulated practical and feasible methods for improving work based on the results of the inspection and analysis, combined with the current situation. This method of rectification, which focuses on inspection and problem-solving, is one of the main experiences in the rectification of first-level organs in the Northwest Administrative Region. In the rectification, all organs combined work summaries with personal ideological inspections, so that the spirit of rectification was specifically implemented in every cadre.

Through this rectification, the first-level organs in the Northwest Region have made preliminary improvements to the more serious bureaucratic styles that existed before - insufficient mobilization of the masses, insufficient understanding of the actual situation, insufficient inspection, unclear focus of work, and chaotic steps. Many organs have dispatched some cadres to ethnic minority areas in various provinces to conduct investigations and research. Due to the improvement of work methods, styles, and systems, the efficiency of the organs has significantly improved compared to the past, and the phenomenon of accumulated official documents and shirking responsibilities has been greatly reduced. The organs have also generally established office, meeting, and other systems, and the responsibilities between superiors and subordinates and between various departments have also been clearly divided. Some organs have formulated regular inspection systems. This has a great effect on eliminating bureaucracy, consolidating the results of rectification, and continuing to improve the ideological role of cadres.

Comrade Peng Dehuai, First Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out at the Northwest Region's first-level rectification symposium: This rectification movement at the first level of the Northwest Administrative Region did not solve all major problems, but only opposed bureaucracy and commandism, and in reality, it only opposed the outstanding parts of them. In order to further improve the ideological and political level of cadres, and to improve the working ability of cadres, it is still necessary to launch a sustained and in-depth ideological struggle against empiricism after the end of this rectification movement. Continue to strengthen theoretical study in order to consolidate the results of the rectification.

　　西北大行政区一级机关
    整风运动已经基本结束
    重点检查具体分析订出改进办法干部思想水平提高工作开始改进
    【新华社西安十九日电】西北大行政区一级机关的整风运动，历时四个月，现已基本结束。
    全区此次整风，是在今春反对贪污腐化、铺张浪费等不良倾向的基础上发动起来，以反对领导工作中的官僚主义为其主要内容。这次整风和工作检查密切结合，并通过检查出来的一个或几个主要问题，联系检查领导和一般干部的思想作风和工作制度等问题，使干部的思想水平普遍得到提高，干部关系更加团结，官僚主义已大为减少，多数机关的工作已开始改进。
    各机关在整风开始都进行了比较深入的动员，有些机关并及时解决了一些可能解决的问题，不能解决的也及时说明理由。这样就打消了部分干部中的消极态度，使检查工作、批评缺点、暴露问题的空气逐渐普遍展开。接着，各机关即根据所暴露出来的问题，选择其中一项或几项主要工作，进行重点检查。在检查中要从产生成绩、缺点的原因联系到执行政策、方针，和思想作风、工作方法、工作制度等各个方面存在的问题，进行全面、具体的分析。多数机关均按此方法进行，一般都根据检查和分析的结果，结合当前情况，订出了切实可行的改进工作的办法。这种重点检查、解决问题的整风方法，是西北大行政区一级机关整风中的主要经验之一。各机关在整风中都结合工作总结，进行个人思想检查，使整风精神具体贯彻到每一干部。
    西北区一级机关经过此次整风，对前所存在的主要问题——发动群众不够，了解实际不够，检查不够，工作重心不明确，步骤杂乱等比较严重的官僚主义作风，已有初步改进。许多机关已抽出部分干部分赴各省少数民族地区进行调查研究工作。由于工作方法、作风和制度的改进，各机关的办事效率较前显著提高，压积公文、推脱责任的现象已大为减少。各机关并普遍建立了办公、会议等制度，上下级之间、各部门之间的职责，也有了明确的划分。有些机关订出了定期的检查制度。这对清除官僚主义、巩固整风成果和继续提高干部思想作用很大。
    中共中央西北局第一书记彭德怀同志在西北区一级整风座谈会上指出：这次西北大行政区一级的整风运动，并不是把一切重大的问题都解决了，只是反对了官僚主义和命令主义，而在实际上也只是反对了其中突出的部分。为了进一步提高干部的思想水平和政治水平，提高干部的工作能力，还须在这一次整风运动结束以后，持久深入地展开反对经验主义的思想斗争。继续加强理论学习，以巩固整风成果。
