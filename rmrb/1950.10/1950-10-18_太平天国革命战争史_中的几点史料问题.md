　　Some Problems with Historical Materials in "A History of the Revolutionary War of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom"
　　Zhuo Shenfu

　　"A History of the Revolutionary War of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" written by Hua Gang (Haiyan Bookstore, first edition, October 1949) is a good book for studying the fifteen-year revolutionary war history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. It has rich materials and correct viewpoints, and it can analyze the reasons for gains and losses from the development of the war, making it easy for readers to understand the problems. Therefore, this book does have undeniable advantages. However, in terms of material selection, some places are still rather rough. Now, I will write down a few points about the historical material problems I have seen:

　　1. "The Taiping army supporting the North was divided into four branches: Huang Shengcai as one branch; Chen Shibao and Xu Zongyang as one branch; Huang Yiyun as one branch, which later merged with Huang Shengcai and others at the junction of Jiangsu and Shandong; and Zeng Lichang as one branch, which finally went north." (Original book, page 96) This passage does not clearly indicate the marching route of each supporting army and how they eventually reached Jinxiang to join forces.

　　2. "Zeng Tianyang's troops advanced from Yichang Prefecture through Yidu and Zhijiang, pressing towards Jingzhou Prefecture." (Original book, page 109) This passage does not explain when Zeng Tianyang arrived in Yichang. The sudden move from Yichang to force Jingzhou is obviously an insufficient narrative.

　　3. "Da Kai has always been popular… therefore, they all supported Da Kai in pacifying the difficulties. Banners covered the river and went down, and the army was stationed in Ningguo…" (Original book, page 124) This passage does not clearly state that Da Kai's army first relieved the siege of Ningguo, and then joined forces in Ningguo to pacify the difficulties in "Tianjing." Instead, it makes "banners covering the river and going down" and "the army was stationed in Ningguo" not connect properly, making it confusing.

　　4. "At this time, Shi Dakai, with a part of the elite Taiping army, had turned from Zhejiang to Jiangxi, passed through Fujian, through Hunan, into Guangxi, and reached the border area of Guizhou, Hunan, and Guangxi in 1859. He could no longer cooperate with the Taiping army in the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River." (Original book, page 125) After writing about Shi Dakai's independent action, this passage did not write about how he fought in various provinces, how he was defeated and died on the banks of the Dadu River in Sichuan, as well as the intention of going west and the difficulties in the march. Instead, it ended him lightly with these few words, leaving the reader feeling at a loss.

　　These are some of the more important points. In addition, there are also unclear places in the geographical materials. At least Comrade Hua Gang did not make a comparison between the place names of the past and the present. Therefore, some places are not easy to find on maps. For example, in the passage on page 96, line 13, "Baojialou downstream of Fenggong", naturally Fenggong is a place name, not a river name, but Fenggong and Baojialou cannot be found anywhere. In addition, the second line on page 106 records: "Rerouting from Huangzhou, Hubei, to the Qing army camp in Ducheng", and Ducheng cannot be found either.

　　In addition, there are some deficiencies in the analysis of the problems. He only wrote about the course of the war from the facts, but ignored the development of the contradictions. For example, line 12 on page 107 records: "In early April 1854, the Eastern King Yang Xiuqing summoned the Wing King Shi Dakai back, and appointed Qinjiri, the Duke of Dingtian, to preside over the military and civilian affairs of Anqing." He did not explain Shi Dakai's achievements. "The Eastern King Yang Xiuqing was jealous of him, and replaced Dakai with Yan King Qin Rigang, and ordered him to return to Beijing to assist in the administration." (Fan Wenlan's "A Brief History of Modern China", Volume 1) There are other similar places.

　　Because the title of this book is "A History of the Revolutionary War of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," I only raise these few opinions on the words within the title. In summary, these shortcomings only indicate that the book still needs some supplements, but they do not affect the value of the book.

　　“太平天国革命战争史”中的几点史料问题
    卓申甫
    华岗著：“太平天国革命战争史”（海燕书店一九四九年十月初版）是研究太平天国十五年革命战争史的一本好书。它材料丰富，观点正确，更能从战争的发展中分析其得失的原因，使读者容易理解问题，所以这本著作确有不可抹煞的优点。不过在取材上，有些地方还嫌粗糙。现在就我所见到的几点史料问题写在下面：
    一、“北援之太平军共分四支：黄生才为一支；陈世保与许宗扬为一支；黄益芸为一支，这一支后来于苏鲁之交与黄生才等会合；曾立昌为一支，最后北上。”（原书九十六页）此段对各支援军进军路线：及以后如何到达金乡会师，没有明确指出。
    二、“曾天养部自宜昌府经宜都、枝江，进逼荆州府。”（原书一○九页）此段关于曾天养何时到达宜昌，未见说明，突然自宜昌逼荆州，显见叙述不够。
    三、“达开素有人望……故均拥护达开靖难，旌旗蔽江而下，师次宁国……”（原书一二四页）此段没写清楚达开军先救宁国之围，而后在宁国会师，去“天京”靖难，却使“蔽江而下”与“师次宁国”两不衔接，令人莫名其妙。
    四、“这时候，石达开带着一部分精锐的太平军，已由浙江转江西，过福建，经湖南，入广西，至一八五九年到了黔湘桂边界地带，已不能与长江上下游太平军配合作战。”（原书一二五页）此段在写石达开自由行动后，没有把他怎样转战各省，怎样败死在四川大渡河岸的经过以及西行的意图和进军中的困难等等写出来，却轻轻的用这么几句话把他结束了，使读者感到茫然。
    这是比较重要的几点。此外在地理材料上还有不清楚的地方。至少华岗同志在今昔地名上没有作一番比照，因此有些地方在图志上就不易找寻了。例如九六页十三行记：“在丰工下游之包家楼”一段，自然丰工是地名，不是河名，但是丰工、包家楼两地都无处可查。另外一○六页二行记：“自湖北黄州绕道出堵城清军大营后”之堵城，又无处可查。
    此外，在问题分析上也有些比较欠缺的地方。他只从事实上写出了战争经过，却忽略了其中矛盾的发展。例如一○七页十二行记：“一八五四年四月初，东王杨秀清召回翼王石达开，以顶天侯秦日纲主持安庆军民各政。”他并没说明石达开的政绩。“东王杨秀清忌之，以燕王秦日纲代达开，命还京襄理朝政。”（范文澜中国近代史上编第一分册）此外类似的地方还有。
    这本书因为题名是“太平天国革命战争史”，所以我只就题内的话提出这几点意见。总括来说，这些缺点只是说明本书还需要一些补充，但并不影响本书的价值。
