    Unite Closely, Strengthen National Defense Preparation, and Strike Against Aggressors
    Joint Statement by Delegations of Various Nationalities
    Resolutely support the Foreign Ministry Spokesperson's statement and Foreign Minister Zhou's telegram to the UN, protesting against the U.S. imperialists' expansion of the war of aggression.

    The delegations of various nationalities currently in the capital have jointly issued a statement expressing their resolute support for the solemn statement of the Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on October 10 and the demands made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai to the United Nations General Assembly on October 17. They also protest against the crimes of the United States in expanding its war of aggression against Korea, invading our country's territory of Taiwan, and bombing and strafing our people. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    The extremely ferocious U.S. imperialists, disregarding the will of peace-loving people around the world, illegally usurped the name of the United Nations, launched a war of aggression against Korea, and carried out armed aggression against our country's territory of Taiwan. In order to further expand its aggression, the U.S. imperialists recently used their voting machine in the United Nations to create an illegal "resolution" allowing U.S. troops to invade the entire Korean peninsula, and fabricated a so-called "Formosa issue," forcibly placing it on the agenda of the General Assembly, attempting to legalize U.S. aggression against Taiwan through this step. The direct result of U.S. imperialist aggression against Korea is not only the infliction of severe disasters on the Korean people, but also a serious threat to world peace and security, and first and foremost, a serious threat to the security of our China. U.S. planes and warships invading Korea have repeatedly violated our country's airspace, strafed and bombed our people, and forcibly interrogated and disrupted our merchant ships' right of navigation on the high seas. Now, they are attempting to spread the flames of the war of aggression to the Chinese border and have put forward the absurd proposal of the so-called "Formosa issue," directly interfering in China's internal affairs and infringing upon China's territory and sovereignty. We are extremely indignant at this frenzied and despicable atrocity of U.S. imperialism.

    We, the people of dozens of nationalities liberated from the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, headed by the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, and supported by U.S. imperialism, resolutely support the solemn statement of the Spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on October 10 and resolutely support the demands made by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai to the UN General Assembly on October 17. We protest against the illegal "resolutions" passed under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism to expand the aggression against Korea and to include the so-called "Formosa issue" on the agenda. We believe that the proposal put forward by the Soviet Union and other five countries for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue is the only proposal that can peacefully and reasonably resolve the Korean issue and guarantee the independence, unity, and democracy of Korea, and therefore is also the most effective way to safeguard China's security and defend world peace. We demand that the United Nations General Assembly revoke the illegal decision to include the so-called "Formosa issue" on the agenda, and resolutely demand that our representatives be present to present their views and participate in the discussion when the United Nations General Assembly and its relevant committees consider the two items on the agenda: the indictment of U.S. aggression against China and the indictment of U.S. infringement upon China's airspace, strafing and bombing of Chinese territory, and shelling of Chinese ships.

    We, all nationalities of China, are determined to strengthen our country's national defense under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party through the close unity and progress of all nationalities, and be prepared to strike at any time against the imperialist aggressors who dare to disregard the will of the entire Chinese people and harm the interests of the Chinese people.

　　紧密团结加强国防准备打击侵略者
    各民族代表团联合发表声明
    坚决拥护外交部发言人的声明和周外长致联大的电报，抗议美帝扩大侵略战争。
    【新华社十八日讯】现在首都的各民族代表团，联合发表声明，表示坚决拥护我外交部发言人十月十日的声明，和周恩来外长十月十七日致联合国大会的电报，并抗议美国扩大侵略朝鲜战争和侵略我国领土台湾和轰炸扫射我国人民的罪行，声明全文如下：
    穷凶极恶的美帝国主义，蔑视全世界爱好和平的人民的意志，非法地盗用了联合国名义，发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，并对我国领土台湾实行了武装侵略。为了进一步扩大侵略，美帝国主义最近又利用它在联合国的表决机器造成了一个让美国军队侵略整个朝鲜的非法“决议”，并捏造了一个所谓“福摩萨问题”，硬将它列入大会议程，企图通过这一步骤使美国对台湾的侵略合法化。美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的直接结果，不仅使朝鲜人民遭受惨重的灾难，并严重地威胁着世界和平、安全，首先是严重地威胁着我们中国的安全。美国侵略朝鲜的飞机军舰曾多次侵犯了我国的领空，扫射轰炸我国人民，破坏我国商船在公海上的航行权而进行强制盘查；现在又企图将侵略战争的火焰延烧到中国边境来，并提出所谓“福摩萨问题”这一荒谬议案，直接干涉中国内政，侵犯中国领土与主权。对于美帝国主义这一疯狂的卑劣的暴行，我们万分愤怒。
    我们从美帝国主义所极力支持的、以卖国贼蒋介石为首的国民党反动派统治之下解放出来的几十个民族的人民，坚决拥护我外交部发言人十月十日的严正声明，坚决拥护我外交部周恩来部长于十月十七日向联大所提出的要求，抗议在美帝国主义操纵下所通过的扩大侵略朝鲜和将所谓“福摩萨问题”列入议程的非法“决议”。我们认为苏联等五国所提和平解决朝鲜问题的提案是唯一能够和平合理地解决朝鲜问题，并保证朝鲜的独立、统一和民主，因而也是最有效地保障中国安全、保卫世界和平的提案。我们要求联合国大会取消将所谓“福摩萨问题”列入议程的非法决定，并坚决要求在联合国大会及其所属有关委员会进行美国侵略中国的控诉案及控诉美国侵犯中国领空，扫射与轰炸中国领土及炮轰中国船只案两项议程时，必须有我国代表出席陈述意见和参加讨论。
    我们中国各民族坚决在中央人民政府和中国共产党的领导下，以各民族的紧密团结和进步，来加强我们国家的国防力量，准备随时打击敢于蔑视中国全体人民意志、危害中国人民利益的帝国主义侵略者。
