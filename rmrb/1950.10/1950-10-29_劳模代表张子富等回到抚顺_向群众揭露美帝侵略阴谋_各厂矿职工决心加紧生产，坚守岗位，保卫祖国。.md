　　Labor Model Representatives Zhang Zifu and Others Return to Fushun
    Exposing the US Imperialist Aggression Plot to the Masses
    Workers and Staff of All Factories and Mines are Determined to Step Up Production, Stick to Their Posts, and Defend the Motherland.
    [Our Newspaper Fushun News] After industrial representatives Zhang Zifu, Duan Zhongzhu, Wei Guojun, Zhang Xiuying, and Liu Jinliang, who attended the National Congress of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, returned to Fushun, they were warmly welcomed by the people of the city. In addition to reporting on the conference to the city's workers and staff, the five labor models focused on publicizing the invincible power of our People's Liberation Army and exposing the US imperialist plot to expand the war of aggression, which further made the 280,000 people of Fushun recognize the ferocious, cruel, and despicable behavior of US imperialism. Due to their publicity, a production competition was launched in various mines and factories to step up production, stick to their posts, and defend the motherland. At more than 180 large and small meetings in various factories, mines, government offices, schools, organizations, and among citizens, they devoted half of their speaking time to publicizing current affairs, and 100,000 people personally heard their loud voices of love for the motherland. Kong Guangling, a coal miner at the Longfeng Mine, said after listening to Zhang Zifu's report: "If the American devils dare to set foot on an inch of our land, they can forget about going back! We must step up production and support the front lines!" This is what every worker has in their heart.
    The labor models firmly remember the two major tasks (building a strong national defense force and building a strong economic force) and the three major roles (the backbone for promoting the victorious advance of the people's cause in all aspects, the reliable pillar of the people's government, and the bridge connecting the people's government with the broad masses) instructed by Chairman Mao. After returning, they have further intensified their leading role in production, thereby creating new model deeds in production and work. After Zhang Zifu returned to the open-pit mine, he went deep into mobilizing and organizing workers to protect the mine, encouraging workers and staff to step up production. Although the production tasks were doubled after October 10th, the daily production still exceeded the production tasks. The Dongxiapan team, which was the first production shock brigade, completed one month's production tasks in twenty days, with an attendance rate of 96.8 percent. After Duan Zhongzhu returned to the factory, he led the workers to organize a factory protection team, carrying out anti-espionage and anti-special agent work day and night, and once did not sleep for three consecutive nights. After Wei Guojun returned to Furnace No. 6, he immediately convened a meeting of workers to study the production situation in the past month and formulated a new production plan, which reduced the production breakage rate and shortened the tapping operation time. The production in twenty days exceeded the original task by 11 percent. After Zhang Xiuying returned to the hospital, she reorganized the organizational structure, so that the work that originally required two people could be done by one person. Liu Jinliang expressed that he would use safe power supply, saving raw coal, and reducing costs to counter the US imperialist plot to expand the war of aggression.

　　劳模代表张子富等回到抚顺
    向群众揭露美帝侵略阴谋
    各厂矿职工决心加紧生产，坚守岗位，保卫祖国。
    【本报抚顺讯】出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的工业代表张子富、段忠珠、魏国钧、张秀英、刘金良返回抚顺后，受到全市人民的热烈欢迎。五位劳模除向全市职工报告大会经过外，并着重宣传了我人民解放军强大无比的力量，揭露了美帝扩大侵略战争的阴谋，使抚顺市二十八万人民，进一步认识了美帝的凶恶、残酷、卑鄙行为。由于他们的宣传，在各矿厂掀起了生产竞赛，加紧生产，坚守岗位，保卫祖国。他们在各厂矿、机关、学校、团体、市民的各种大小一百八十余次会上，宣传目前时事占去了讲话时间的二分之一，有十万人亲自听到他们的热爱祖国的宏亮声音。龙凤矿采煤工人孔广龄听了张子富的报告之后说：“美国鬼子胆敢沾咱一寸土地，就别打算回去！咱们要加紧生产，支援前线！”这是每个工人心里的话。
    劳模们牢牢不忘毛主席指示的两大任务（建立强大的国防军，建立强大的经济力量）和三大作用（推动各方面人民事业胜利前进的骨干，人民政府的可靠支柱，人民政府联系广大群众的桥梁），回来之后，把平时在生产中的带头作用，更加紧发挥起来，因而在生产、工作中又创造出新的模范事迹。张子富回到露天矿后，就深入动员，组织工人护矿，鼓励职工加紧生产，虽然自十月十日后生产任务加重了一倍，但每日仍超过生产任务。出现第一个生产突击队的东下盘股，二十天完成了一个月的生产任务，出勤率达到百分之九十六点八。段忠珠回厂后，领导工人组织护厂队，昼夜进行防奸防特工作，曾连续三夜未睡。魏国钧回到六号炉后，马上召集工友开会，研究了一个月以来的生产情况，制订了新的生产计划，使生产破损率降低，出炉作业时间缩短。二十天的生产，超过了原任务的百分之十一。张秀英回到医院后，整顿了组织机构，使原先两个人的工作一个人就能作了。刘金良表示要以安全供电、节省原煤、降低成本来回击美帝扩大侵略战争的阴谋。
