　　Oppose the New American Plot to Invade Taiwan
    — World Knowledge Editorial
    [Xinhua News Agency, October 14th] The World Knowledge Weekly, published in Beijing today, published an editorial entitled "Oppose the New American Plot to Invade Taiwan," expressing a solemn protest against the United States' illegal inclusion of the so-called "Taiwan issue" on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly. The editorial first pointed out: There is only one issue regarding Taiwan at present, and that is the issue of the United States' aggression against the territory of the People's Republic of China, Taiwan Province. Apart from this, there is no other issue regarding Taiwan. However, the so-called "Taiwan issue" raised by the United States is the "issue of Taiwan's status." This proposal itself constitutes interference in China's internal affairs and is therefore a violation of the United Nations Charter and an insult to the Chinese people.
    The editorial pointed out: The purpose of the United States in putting forward this proposal is to attempt to overturn all international agreements regarding Taiwan, such as the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, through illegal resolutions of the United Nations, to obliterate the fact that Taiwan has been returned to China since the Japanese surrender, and to obtain "legal" recognition of the current armed aggression of Taiwan by the United States.
    The editorial also pointed out: "The United States' presentation of this proposal, which insults the Chinese people, is inseparable from the United States' hostility towards the victory and growth of the Chinese people. In the eyes of American imperialism, the People's Republic of China, which has broken free from the shackles of imperialism and feudalism, has established the closest fraternal relations with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, and has achieved great achievements in construction over the past year, is the biggest obstacle to the American war plan to invade Asia." "We must further point out that the United States' actions and conspiracies to invade Taiwan are not only the greatest manifestation of hostility towards the Chinese people, but also the greatest threat to peace in the East and the world."
    The editorial emphasized: The Chinese people are highly vigilant about this new conspiracy and new challenge of American imperialism. The Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan and will continue to expose and accuse the United States' actions to invade Taiwan and its even greater conspiracies to the people of the world.
    The commentary concluded: The United States' aggression against Taiwan, and therefore its proposal to the United Nations to insult the Chinese people and undermine the United Nations Charter, will only further increase the Chinese people's determination to defend world peace, safeguard their territory, and oppose aggression. All aggressive plans of the United States will inevitably backfire.

　　反对美国侵略台湾新阴谋
    ——世界知识社评
    【新华社十四日讯】今日在北京出版的世界知识周刊，以“反对美国侵略台湾的新阴谋”为题发表社评，对美国非法将所谓“台湾问题”的议案列入联合国大会议程一事，表示严正抗议。社评首先指出：台湾目前只有一个问题，就是美国侵略中华人民共和国的领土台湾省的问题，除此之外，台湾没有别的问题。但美国所谓的“台湾问题”，是“台湾的地位问题”，这个提案本身就构成了对于中国内政的干涉，因而是对于联合国宪章的破坏，对于中国人民的侮辱。
    社评指出：美国提出这个提案的目的，是企图通过联合国的非法决议，推翻开罗宣言、波茨坦公告等一切国际协定关于台湾的决定，抹煞日本投降以来台湾已经归还给中国的事实，使美国目前的武装侵略台湾得到“法律”上的承认。
    社评并指出：“美国此时提出这个侮辱中国人民的提案，是与美国的敌视中国人民的胜利壮大分不开的。在美国帝国主义心目中，挣脱了帝国主义和封建主义枷锁的，和苏联及各人民民主国家建立了最亲密的兄弟关系，一年来取得了建设事业的伟大成就的中华人民共和国，是美国侵略亚洲的战争计划的最大障碍”。“我们必须进一步指出：美国侵略台湾的行动和阴谋，不仅是对于中国人民的敌意的最大表现，而且是对于东方和全世界和平的最大威胁。”
    社评着重称：中国人民对于美国帝国主义的这一新的阴谋，新的挑战，是具有极高度的警惕性的。中国人民决心解放台湾，并且要把美国侵略台湾的行动及其更大的阴谋，向全世界人民不断地揭露和控诉。
    论评结语称：美国侵略台湾，并因此而向联合国提出侮辱中国人民、破坏联合国宪章的提案，其结果只有越发增加中国人民保卫世界和平、捍卫国土、反对侵略的决心。美国的一切侵略计划必将自食其果。
