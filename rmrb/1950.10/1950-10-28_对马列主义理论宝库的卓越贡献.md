　　Outstanding Contributions to the Treasure Trove of Marxist-Leninist Theory
    Philosophy Master Bao Qiekaliefu
    Comrade Stalin's articles published on the occasion of the debate on linguistics in the newspaper "Pravda" are outstanding events in the ideological life of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet people. The image of the greatest Marxist-Leninist theorist, a genius scientific innovator who combines great theoretical ability with rich experience in revolutionary practical struggle – the wise teacher and leader – is as vividly expressed in these articles of Comrade Stalin as in all his works.
    Comrade Stalin's new works – "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics," "Some Problems of Linguistics," and "Answers to Comrades' Letters" – are the most valuable contributions to the treasure trove of Marxist-Leninist theory and are a true example of the creative development of advanced science. In these articles, Comrade Stalin's Marxist viewpoint is more forcefully emphasized: Marxism is a living, developing science that keenly listens to the voices of life and practice, a science that has nothing to do with any dogmatism and fear of new things.
    In Comrade Stalin's new works, the most complex and important problems of Marxist theory of language have been solved, the incredible confusion that the anti-Marxist Marrist school brought to the Soviet scientific community has been eliminated, and the only correct path for the development of Soviet linguistics has been pointed out. Comrade Stalin raised the Marxist doctrine on language to a new stage.
    Some issues of great significance for the cause of communist construction in the Soviet Union have been resolved in Comrade Stalin's articles. Comrade Stalin's new works are of inestimable significance to communist parties of all countries and to all advanced and progressive forces in the world.
    It should not be forgotten that various reactionary ideas in linguistics are by no means in a secondary position in the ideological arsenal of the enemies of peace and the public enemies of the people of all countries – the American and British imperialist elements. In order to justify their shameless ambition to seek world hegemony, in order to justify their bestial plans to eliminate the state sovereignty of other nations, the American and British reactionaries are vociferously chanting the despicable platitudes of the "superiority" of Americanism and the Anglo-Saxon language, and the despicable platitudes that the languages of all other nations will inevitably be squeezed out by the Anglo-Saxon language.
    Comrade Stalin's works dealt a fatal blow to the misanthropic propaganda of the American and British barbarians. These works, with a clear exposition of the new theory of the correct development path of various nations and their languages, armed advanced thought and the entire progressive mankind. These works inspire the people of the world to strive to fight against the American and British plunderers.

    Stalin's works on problems of linguistics laid a solid foundation for creating a truly Marxist science of language. Comrade Stalin thoroughly exposed the so-called "new theory" of language of Marr. Until now, Marr's "new theory" of language had been regarded and promoted by his successors and colleagues as a truly Marxist direction in science. As Comrade Stalin pointed out, Marr's "new theory" has fundamental errors in essence, and has nothing in common with Marxism, and Marr himself was only a simplifier and vulgarizer of Marxism. Marr brought many wrong rules and goals to Soviet linguistics, which made linguistics chaotic and eventually led linguistics to deviate from the Marxist-Leninist path in science. Among these wrong rules and goals, the first is Marr's theory that language is a superstructure, his denial of the national character of languages and his recognition of languages as "class-based," and his demand to establish Soviet language science without considering what linguistics has achieved in the past.
    Comrade Stalin crushed the warlord-style system in the language science organs, thoroughly exposed the anti-Marxist essence of Marr's linguistic theory, and led Soviet linguistics from a dead end and stagnation to the broad road of true Marxist development.
    Comrade Stalin very clearly and precisely stipulated the basic guiding principles of Soviet language science, which is to regard language as a social phenomenon that is constantly connected with the entire history of human society. Comrade Stalin pointed out that the laws of language and its development can "only be understood by closely linking the history of social development with the history of the people who created and use this language."
    In Stalin's this rule, a key to the correct solution of all fundamental problems of linguistics is provided.
    Comrade Stalin armed linguists with a profound concept of the true social mission of language as a tool for people's communication and exchange of ideas with each other, and as a tool for social development and struggle.
    Regardless of the idealists' separation of language from thinking and society, and regardless of the absurd belief of the Marr type that people can communicate with the aid of only one kind of thinking and without language, Comrade Stalin pointed out that language cannot exist apart from society, that language is inextricably linked to human thinking, and that language is one of the most important conditions for the existence of society as a whole.
    Comrade Stalin said: "The exchange of ideas is always extremely necessary, because without the exchange of ideas, it is impossible for people to coordinate their joint actions in the struggle against the forces of nature and in the struggle for the material wealth necessary for production, and it is impossible to succeed in social production activities, and therefore social production itself cannot exist. It can be seen that without a language that is understood by the entire society, without a common language for members of the society, the society will stop producing, will collapse, and will not be able to continue to exist. In this sense, language is not only a tool of communication, but also a tool of social struggle and development."
    In clarifying the characteristics of language and its position among other social phenomena, Comrade Stalin thoroughly defeated Marr's theory that language is a superstructure. Comrade Stalin pointed out that this opening rule of the language "new theory" completely confused the science of language, because this rule, while emphasizing the similarity between language and other social phenomena, ignored a major thing—the quality characteristics of language, its difference from the base and the superstructure, and it also ignored the fact that only language is inherently capable of fulfilling the function of a tool for communication between people.
    Comrade Stalin thoroughly and clearly elaborated the fundamental differences between language and the superstructure. Language is not a superstructure, because unlike the superstructure, language is not built by this or that individual economic base, and it is not constrained by this or that individual economic base. The superstructure, which actively helps its own base to form and consolidate, is characterized by harming one base for the benefit of another, but language never shows any particular interest in harming one base for the benefit of another. Secondly, language differs from the superstructure or the base in that it is not the product of one era, but the product of many eras, and therefore it survives longer than any base or any superstructure. Comrade Stalin used the Russian language as an example to confirm this conclusion. Although in the period of one hundred years after Pushkin's death, two bases and their superstructures (feudalism and capitalism) were eliminated in Russia, and a new, socialist system was produced, the Russian language has not been essentially changed. Finally, language differs from the superstructure in that language is directly connected to people's production and any other activities, so it directly and immediately reflects changes in production without waiting for changes in the base.
    Comrade Stalin clarified the fundamental differences between language and the superstructure, clarified the relative irrelevance of language to changes in the base and superstructure, clarified the ability of language to serve as a tool for communication over many periods, thereby ending the harmful garrulousness of the Marr type about language change and mutation, ending the contempt for the solid foundation of language, and ending attempts to shake this foundation and destroy one of the most important conditions for social vitality.
    Stalin's conclusion on the national nature of language is closely related to the above rules. Comrade Stalin thoroughly exposed the anti-Marxist essence of Marr's formula – language "has a class nature" – which is an inevitable conclusion derived from the mistaken understanding of language as a superstructure phenomenon. Language is actually not created by a certain base or class, but by the entire historical process, the entire society, all classes, and the efforts of hundreds of generations. This also explains that language can serve the entire society and all classes in the society equally.
    Comrade Stalin said: "The existence and creation of language is to serve the entire society as a tool for people's communication, so that language is something that is common to all members of society, and is unified for society. It must serve members of society equally regardless of their class status."
    Despite the insistence of Marr and his disciples that there can be no non-class language in a class society, Comrade Stalin showed that throughout the entire history of human society, language, as a tool for people's communication, has been the common and unified language of society. Not only in the period of primitive communal system (when there were no classes), but also in the subsequent periods (when social class distinctions had formed and the struggle between classes had begun), languages as people's communication tool that is for all the people have been perfected and developed. The languages of tribes, clans, and nations are all languages of the whole people.
    This conclusion does not contradict the existence of so-called "class-based" slang, jargon, and argot, which Marr and his ilk always cited to prove the class nature of language.
    Comrade Stalin showed that slang cannot be equated with language, because slang is only a branch of the national language, and has no its own grammatical structure and basic vocabulary, has no independence of any language, and can never become an independent language, thus ending the confusion on this issue. Similarly, slang cannot be equated with local (regional) dialects, which serve the masses of the people and have their own grammatical structure and basic vocabulary. In the process of forming a nation, some local dialects can develop into independent national languages, as illustrated by the history of the Russian language formed on the basis of the Kursk-Orel dialect, or the history of the Ukrainian language based on the Poltava-Kiev dialect.
    Marr and his disciples attempted to consolidate their erroneous theory of language "class nature" by randomly citing individual passages from Marxist-Leninist classics, by pointing out the opposition and class characteristics of culture under the conditions of conflicting interests of the hostile classes in society and their ideologies, and so on. Comrade Stalin thoroughly proved the groundlessness of this argument, which distorted the true views of the Marxist-Leninist classics, because the true views of the Marxist-Leninist classics always take the recognition of the national nature of language as the starting point at any time and any place.
    As for the opposition of class interests and the fierce struggle between classes, these contradictory facts themselves cannot be used as an argument for recognizing the class nature of language, because the opposition of classes not only does not exclude, but stipulates their connection and mutual constraint, and it does not mean the division of society. Comrade Stalin said: "Only those who are completely ignorant of Marxist theory and have no understanding of the nature of language can say such absurd things as the division of society, the 'class-based' language, the 'class-based' grammar, and so on."
    Although culture in bourgeois society has class characteristics, it cannot prove that language has a "class nature," because, as Comrade Stalin pointed out: "Culture and language are two different things. Culture can be bourgeois and socialist. Language is a tool for communication and is always national; it can serve bourgeois culture or socialist culture."
    Stalin's discussions on the connection between language and thought, the connection with people's material practice and perceptual activities, the grammatical structure and vocabulary of language, and the laws of historical development of language are of great significance to Soviet science.
    In developing the views of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, Comrade Stalin showed the inextricable link between thinking and language; there can be no thinking without language. Thoughts "can only be produced and exist on the basis of linguistic materials, in the terms and sentences of language." "The truth of thought is expressed in language." - This brilliant rule of Stalin's dealt a fatal blow to the idealist claims that language seems to constrain thought and hinder the understanding of material essence. The modern barbarians of the United States and Britain attempted to expel materialism from science, tried their best to slander people's normal speech, dreamed of reforming language, and some people who took a bestial hatred of materialism kept clamoring for the general denial of language.
    Stalin contrasted the materialist understanding of language phenomena with the idealist view that language seems to be a special field that is not connected to objective reality. The materialist understanding acknowledges that language phenomena are directly related to production and any other activities of people, and acknowledges that language can directly and immediately reflect changes in production and changes in people's living conditions.
    Comrade Stalin taught that the special essence of language lies in its basic vocabulary and grammatical structure.
    The language vocabulary, which is most sensitive to changes in social living conditions, production, culture, science, etc., is in a state of constant movement. However, the basic vocabulary of language, which includes all the fundamental words, changes very slowly. The language vocabulary reflects the state of the language, but it is not the language itself.
    The language grammar stipulates the rules for changing words and combining words into sentences. Vocabulary only has the greatest significance when combined with language grammar, and language becomes organized and full of thought. The grammatical structure of language changes more slowly. Comrade Stalin pointed out that one should look for the answer to the well-known and verified by a large number of historical facts, language's great resistance to violent assimilation phenomena in the stability of the grammatical structure and basic vocabulary of language.
    For hundreds of years, the Turkish oppressors tried to injure and destroy the Balkan nations, but they failed to eliminate these nations and their languages. The histories of Poland, Georgia, Armenia, and many other nations also illustrate this point. The people of these nations were unwilling to be ravaged by foreign invaders, waged a long struggle, and were able to preserve their national characteristics and their languages.
    This conclusion of Comrade Stalin's dealt a fatal blow to the imperialist policy of violently assimilating other nations and languages. This conclusion clearly and unequivocally exposes the inherent decay and inevitable bankruptcy of the bestial program of eliminating other nations and subjecting them to the big capitalists of Wall Street (the new ambitionists who are now trying to dominate the world – the American imperialists are chanting this program).
    Language is characterized by great stability and survives much longer than any base or superstructure, but its stability is not absolute. Due to the development of society, language also develops slowly and gradually; the vocabulary of language changes, and the grammatical structure of language is constantly improved. At the same time, as Comrade Stalin pointed out, the development of language, unlike the development of the superstructure, is not the method of eliminating existing languages and creating new languages.
    Comrade Stalin emphasized that "Marxism believes that the transition of language from the old quality to the new quality is not realized through mutation, not through the elimination of existing languages and the creation of new languages, but through the gradual accumulation of new quality elements, that is, through the gradual death of old quality elements."
    As Comrade Stalin pointed out, this rule does not contradict the many facts of language fusion, because fusion is a long-term process, fusion does not lead to the creation of new languages, and usually it is the preservation of one of the existing languages as the victor.
              ×                ×                ×
    Comrade Stalin's new works have completed a profound transformation in the science of language. But the significance of these works goes far beyond the scope of linguistics. Comrade Stalin, in discussing the phenomenon that language is closely related to the entire history of human society, enriched the Marxist-Leninist science with many new rules and generalizations. These new rules and generalizations are of great significance not only to linguistics, but also to philosophy, history, economic science, and all other fields of knowledge.
    Therefore, it is particularly important to emphasize the outstanding significance of Stalin's discussion of the fundamental issues of historical materialism theory, first of all, about the base and the superstructure, their relationship and mutual influence. Comrade Stalin discussed that the base is the socio-economic system at a certain stage of social development, and its mission is to serve the society economically. And the superstructure—this is the society's political, legal, religious, artistic, and philosophical views, as well as the political and legal systems that are adapted to these views, and the superstructure uses these things to serve the society. Comrade Stalin extremely clearly and profoundly elaborated that the superstructure is constrained by its own base, the class characteristics of the superstructure under class society conditions, and its active struggle for its own base. Comrade Stalin said: "After the superstructure appears, it will become a great active force, actively helping the formation and consolidation of its own base, and taking all measures to help the new system to eradicate and eliminate the old base and the old classes."
    These outstanding rules of Stalin help to more deeply understand the laws of social development, the transformative role of the Soviet state and Marxist-Leninist ideology in communist construction, and more deeply expose the irreconcilable contradictions that are driving capitalism towards inevitable and rapid demise.
    Secondly, Stalin's criticism of the primitive, anarchic social views is also of great significance, which regards the opposition of interests between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, their fierce class struggle, as the division of society, as cutting off all ties between the two hostile classes.
    Comrade Stalin pointed out: "No matter how sharp the class struggle is, it will not cause the division of society." This important instruction of Comrade Stalin fully exposes the fictions of the bourgeoisie and its right-wing socialist servants, who fabricated that the struggle of the working class against capitalist enslavement seems to lead to the "division" and "destruction" of society.
    In Comrade Stalin's new works, the laws of materialist dialectics and materialist epistemology have been further developed. In these works, the characteristics of the transition from one quality state to another, the jumps in the development process, and the issue of revolutionary, qualitative transformation are raised in new ways. Stalin instructed that the law of transition from the old quality to the new quality is necessary by the method of mutation for societies divided into two hostile classes, but it is not necessary by the method of mutation for societies without hostile classes. This instruction of Stalin clearly illustrates the essential characteristics of the socialist society development, and its great historical superiority over capitalism. Other rules of Marxist-Leninist science - the doctrine on the unity and struggle of opposites in the development process, the connection and mutual constraint of phenomena, the doctrine on the role of tactile perception, sensual perception, and thinking in people's cognitive activities, have also been further developed in Comrade Stalin's works.

    Stalin's works on problems of linguistics mobilize the entire party and all cadres to study Marxist-Leninist theory more deeply. These works require strengthening the application of Marxism-Leninism in all fields of Soviet science and culture, vigorously fighting against the slight phenomena that vulgarize and degrade the Bolshevik theoretical weapons, and fighting against all and any anti-Marxist schools and tendencies in ideology. Comrade Stalin emphasized the great important principle that Soviet science is growing day by day through the struggle of opinions and free criticism, and emphasized that it is necessary to resolutely abolish the remnants of that base warlord-style rule in the scientific community.
    Comrade Stalin supplemented the Bolshevik theoretical arsenal with new rules and generalizations, thereby giving the Soviet people new weapons to solve the great tasks facing the Soviet state and the glorious Bolshevik Party.

　　对马列主义理论宝库的卓越贡献
    哲学硕士鲍契卡列夫
    斯大林同志就《真理报》展开有关语言学问题辩论一事而发表的几篇文章，乃是布尔什维克党和苏联人民思想生活中的卓越事件。最伟大的马列主义理论家、把巨大理论能力与革命实际斗争的丰富经验融为一体的天才科学革新者——英明导师和领袖的形象，正如在斯大林同志的所有著作中一样，也在这几篇文章里面鲜明地表现出来了。
    斯大林同志的新著作——“论马克思主义在语言学中的问题”、“论语言学的一些问题”、“答同志们的信”，乃是对马列主义理论宝库的最宝贵的贡献，乃是真正创造性的发展先进科学的典范。在这几篇文章里面，更加有力地着重表明了斯大林的马克思主义观点：马克思主义是活生生的、发展的、锐敏地倾听生活和实践呼声的科学，是与任何教条主义以及与害怕新事物的现象无关的科学。
    在斯大林同志的新著作中，解决了马克思主义的语言理论的最复杂而最重要的问题，消除了反马克思主义的马尔学派给苏联科学界带来的不可思议的混乱现象，并指出苏联语言学唯一正确的发展道路。斯大林同志把马克思主义关于语言的学说提高到新阶段。
    对苏联的共产主义建设事业有巨大意义的一些问题，已在斯大林同志的几篇著作里面解决了。斯大林同志的新著作，对各国共产党，对世界上所有先进的、进步的力量，都有不可估价的意义。
    不应该忘记：语言学方面的各种反动思想，在和平的敌人及各国人民的公敌——美英帝国主义分子的思想武库中，决不是占居末位的。美英反动分子为了论证自己追求世界霸权的无耻野心，为了论证自己消灭其他各国人民国家主权的兽性计划，正声嘶力竭地高唱美国主义和盎格鲁撒克逊语言“优越性”的卑鄙滥调，高唱似乎所有其他各民族语言不可避免被盎格鲁撒克逊语言所排挤的卑鄙滥调。
    斯大林同志的著作对美英野蛮主义者的仇视人类的宣传给以致命打击。这些著作以鲜明阐述各民族及其语言正确发展道路的新理论，武装着先进思想、武装着全体进步人类。这些著作鼓舞着全世界人民努力与美英掠夺者进行斗争。

    斯大林的有关语言学诸问题的著作，对创建真正马克思主义的语言科学，奠定了牢固的基石。斯大林同志彻底揭露所谓马尔的语言“新学说”。迄今以前，马尔的语言“新学说”，曾被他的继承者和同僚们尊视并推崇为似乎是科学中的真正马克思主义的方向。正如斯大林同志所指出，马尔“新学说”在实质上有基本的错误，并与马克思主义毫无共同之点，而马尔本人只不过是马克思主义的简单化者和庸俗化者而已。马尔给苏联语言学带来许多错误的规则和目标，这些规则和目标使语言学混乱不堪，最后并导使语言学在科学中离开马列主义道路。属于这些错误规则和目标之列的，首先就是马尔关于语言是上层建筑的学说，他否认全民语言的本性并承认语言“有阶级性”，他要求毫不考虑语言学在过去所获得的东西而来建立苏联的语言科学。
    斯大林同志击溃了语言学机关中的军阀式的制度，彻底揭露了马尔语言学说的反马克思主义的实质，把苏联语言学从绝路和停滞状态中引到真正马克思主义发展的康庄大道。
    斯大林同志极鲜明确切地规定了苏联语言科学的基本指导原则，这原则就在于把语言看成为与人类社会全部历史不断联系的社会现象。斯大林同志指出说，语言及其发展规律，“只有密切联系社会发展的历史，密切联系创造这种语言、使用这种语言的人民的历史，去进行研究，才有可能了解。”
    在斯大林的这一规则里面，给与了正确解决语言学的所有根本问题的钥匙。
    斯大林同志以人们的交际和彼此之间思想交流的工具、社会发展与斗争的工具——语言的真正社会使命的深刻概念，武装了语言学者。
    不顾唯心主义者使语言脱离思维和社会，不顾马尔之辈荒诞地认为人们只要借助一种思维、没有语言也能交往，斯大林同志表明：语言是不能脱离社会而存在的，语言密不可分地联系着人类的思维，语言是社会作为一个整体而存在的最重要条件之一。
    斯大林同志说：“思想交流是经常极端必要的，因为没有思想交流，便不可能使人们在与自然力斗争中、在为生产必需的物质财富的斗争中调协其共同行动，便不可能在社会生产行为中获得成功，因此也就不可能有社会生产本身的存在。可见没有全社会都懂得的语言，没有社会组成员共同的语言，社会便会停止生产，便会崩溃，便会无法继续生存。在这个意义上说，语言既是交际的工具，同时也就是社会斗争和发展的工具。”
    斯大林同志在阐明语言的特点及其在其他社会现象中间的地位时，彻底击溃了马尔的关于语言是上层建筑的学说。斯大林同志表明：语言“新学说”的这个开头的规则，就彻底混乱了语言科学，因为，这个规则在强调语言与其他社会现象类似的几点的时候，忽略了一个主要的东西——语言的品质上的特性、它与基础和上层建筑所不同的地方，它也忽略了这样的事实——即只有语言才天生能够完成人们之间交际工具的职能。
    斯大林同志周详明确地阐述了语言与上层建筑根本不同之处。语言不是上层建筑，因为与上层建筑迥然不同，语言不是由这一或那一个别经济基础所建成，并且不受这一或那一个别经济基础所约制。积极帮助自己的基础形成和巩固的上层建筑，其特点是以一个基础损害另一个基础，但语言决不在一个基础损害另一个基础上面表现出某种特别的兴趣。其次，语言与上层建筑或基础迥然不同之处，在于它不是一个时代的产物，而是许多时代的产物，因此，它比任何基础及任何上层建筑都能生存得更加久远。斯大林同志以俄语为例，确证了这个结论。虽然在普式庚逝世后一百年的时期内，在俄国曾消灭了两个基础及其上层建筑（封建主义和资本主义），并产生了新的、社会主义的制度，但俄语没有受到本质的改变。最后，语言与上层建筑迥然不同之处，在于语言是直接联系人们的生产和任何别的活动，因此，它不等待基础中的变化，而就直接和立即反映出生产中的变化。
    斯大林同志阐明了语言与上层建筑根本不同之处，阐明了语言与基础和上层建筑的变化之相对的无关，阐明了语言在许多时期过程内的作为交际工具的能力，从而终结了马尔之辈关于语言变革和突变的有害的饶舌，终结了对语言的牢固基础所采取的蔑视态度，终结了妄想动摇这基础、破坏社会生气勃勃的最重要条件之一的企图。
    斯大林的关于语言之全民本性的结论，是与上述规则密切相联系的。斯大林同志彻底揭露了马尔的公式——语言“有阶级性”——的反马克思主义的实质，这个实质乃是因错误地把语言理解为上层建筑现象而得出的必然结论。语言实际上并不是由某个基础或阶级所造成，而是由全部历史过程、整个社会、所有阶级、数百代人的努力所造成。这也就说明语言能够一视同仁地服务于整个社会及社会的所有阶级。
    斯大林同志说：“语言的存在与语言的创造也就是为了作为人们交际的工具而替全社会服务，就是为了使语言成为对社会全体组成员是共同的东西，对社会是统一的东西。它要对社会组成员同等服务而不管这些组成员的阶级地位怎样。”
    尽管马尔及其门徒硬说在阶级社会里面不可能有非阶级的语言，但斯大林同志表明，在人类社会全部历史过程中，作为人们交际工具的语言曾是社会共同的，统一的语言。不仅在原始公社制度时期（那时没有阶级），而且，就是在以后的时期（那时社会的阶级区分已经形成，阶级间的斗争已经开展），作为全民的人们交际工具的语言，都在日臻完善和日益发展。部落、部族和民族的语言，都是全民的语言。
    这个结论决不与所谓“有阶级性的”习惯语、同行语和雅语的存在发生矛盾，马尔之辈曾经总是引用所谓“有阶级性的”习惯语、同行语和雅语来证明语言之有阶级性。
    斯大林同志表明了不能把同行语与语言同等看待，因为同行语只是民族语言的支脉，而且没有自己的文法构造和基本词汇，没有任何语言的独立性，并且永远不能够变成独立的语言，因此，就终结了对这个问题的混乱现象。同样也不能把同行语和地方性的（地域性的）习惯语同等看待，地方性的（地域性的）习惯语是服务于人民大众并有自己的文法构造和基本词汇的。在形成民族的过程中，某些地方习惯语能够发展成独立的民族语言，如像在库尔斯克——奥勒尔的习惯语的基础上形成的俄语的历史，或者以波尔塔瓦——基辅的习惯语为基础的乌克兰语言的历史，都说明了这一点。
    马尔及其门徒，企图以胡乱引证马列主义经典作家的个别章句，企图以在社会的敌对阶级利益及其思想意识条件之下指出对立性和文化的阶级特性等等，来巩固他们错误的语言“阶级性的”理论。斯大林同志彻底证明了这种论据的毫无根据，这种论据曲解了马列主义经典作家的真正观点，因为马列主义经典作家的真正观点是无论何时何地都以承认语言的全民本性为出发点的。
    至于谈到阶级利益的对立、阶级之间的残酷斗争，那么这些矛盾的事实本身并不能作为承认语言的阶级本性的论据，因为阶级的对立不但不排除，而且规定它们的联系性和互相制约性，并且也决不意味着社会的分裂。斯大林同志说：“只有在马克思主义理论上完全无知，只有丝毫不懂语言的本性，才会使得我们某些同志说出什么社会分裂，“阶级的”语言，“阶级的”文法等类荒唐话。”
    虽然资产阶级社会里面的文化有阶级特性，但也不能证明语言有“阶级性”，因为，正如斯大林同志所表明：“文化与语言是两个不同的东西。文化可以有资产阶级的和社会主义的。语言是交际的工具，永远是全民性的，它可以替资产阶级文化服务，也可以替社会主义文化服务。”
    斯大林的关于语言和思维的联系、和人们的物质实践活动以及知觉活动的联系，关于语言的文法构造以及词汇、关于语言的历史发展规律性的论述，对于苏联科学的意义是很大的。
    斯大林同志在发挥马克思、恩格斯和列宁的观点之时，曾表明思维与语言的密不可分的联系，没有语言就不可能有思维，思想“只有在语言的材料的基础上，在语言的术语和词句的基础上才能产生和存在。”“思想的真实性是表现在语言之中。”——斯大林的这一个天才的规则，对那些关于语言似乎拘束思想并妨碍理解物质实质的唯心主义说法，给以致命的打击。近代美英两国的野蛮主义者，妄图把唯物主义从科学中排出，千方百计诽谤人们的正常话语，梦谈改革语言，而且某些对唯物主义采取兽性憎恨态度的人们，则喋喋不休地扬言一般的否认语言。
    唯心主义观点认为语言似乎是不与客观现实相联系的特殊领域，斯大林同志把和唯物主义对语言现象的理解拿来和这种唯心主义的观点对立。唯物主义的理解承认语言现象是与生产以及人们任何其他活动直接联系着，并承认语言能够直接和立即反映生产中的变化、人们生活条件中的变化。
    斯大林同志教导说，语言的特别本质就在于它的基本词汇和文法构造。
    对社会生活条件、生产、文化、科学等等的变化最富敏感性的语言词汇，是处在不断运动的状态中。可是，包括着一切根本字的语言基本词汇，变化则是很慢的。语言词汇反映着语言的状况，但它还不是语言本身。
    语言文法规定着字的变化以及联字成句的规则，词汇只有在与语言文法相结合的时候才有最大的意义，而语言则成为有条有理和富有思想意义的东西。语言的文法构造，变化得更慢。斯大林同志指出说，应当在语言的文法构造和基本词汇的稳固性里面，去寻找众所周知的、为大量历史事实所证实的、语言对暴力同化现象起巨大反抗性的答案。
    土耳其的强暴者力图损伤、破坏巴尔干各民族，曾达数百年之久，但是他们未能消灭这些民族以及它们的语言。波兰、格鲁吉亚、阿尔明尼亚以及其他许多民族的历史，也都说明这一点。这些民族的人民不愿异族掠夺者的摧残，进行了长期斗争，并能以保存自己民族的特征和自己的语言。
    斯大林同志的这个结论，对帝国主义的暴力同化其他民族和语言的政策，给以致命的打击。这个结论，鲜明确切地揭露了那种消灭其他民族、并使之服从华尔街大资本家的兽性纲领（现在妄图世界霸权的新野心家们——美帝国主义者正高唱这一纲领的滥调）的内在腐朽性及其必然破产。
    语言以极大稳固性而著称，并比任何基础和上层建筑生存得甚为长久，但是它的稳固性并不是绝对的。由于社会的发展，语言也缓慢地、逐渐地发展，语言的词汇在变化，语言的文法构造日臻完善。同时，正如斯大林同志所指出，语言的发展，不像上层建筑那样的发展，不是用消灭现存的语言、创造新的语言的方法。
    斯大林同志着重指出说：“马克思主义认为语言从旧的质到新的质的转变不是经过突变，不是经过消灭现存的语言和创造新的语言，而是经过新质的要素的逐渐积累，也就是经过旧质要素的逐渐死亡来实现的。”
    正如斯大林同志所指出，这个规则决不与语言融合的许多事实相矛盾，因为融合是一个长期的过程，融合并不导致创造新语言，而通常是从现存的语言中保存一种作为胜利者的语言。

    斯大林同志的新著作，在语言科学中完成了深刻变革。但是这些著作的意义却远远超出语言学的范围。斯大林同志在论述语言与人类社会全部历史密切联系的现象之时，以许多新的规则和归纳来丰富了马列主义科学。这些新规则和归纳，不仅对语言学有很大意义，而且对哲学、历史、经济科学以及所有其他知识领域都有重大意义。
    因此，着重指出斯大林所论述的历史唯物主义理论的根本问题，首先是关于基础与上层建筑、它们的关系和互相影响的卓越意义是特别重要的。斯大林同志论述基础是社会发展到某一阶段上的社会经济制度，它的使命在于从经济上来为社会服务。而上层建筑——这是社会对于政治、法律、宗教、美术、哲学的观点，以及适合于这些观点的政治法律等制度，上层建筑就是以这些东西来服务于社会。斯大林同志极明确深刻地阐述了上层建筑是由自己的基础所制约、上层建筑在阶级社会条件下的阶级特性以及其为自己的基础而积极斗争。斯大林同志说：“上层建筑”出现后，就要成为极大的积极力量，积极帮助自己基础的形成和巩固，采取一切办法帮助新制度来根除和消灭旧基础与旧阶级。”
    斯大林的这些卓越的规则，有助于更深入地理解社会发展规律、苏维埃国家和马列主义意识形态在共产主义建设中的改造作用，更深刻地揭露那些推动资本主义走向必然迅速灭亡的不可调和的矛盾。
    其次，斯大林对原始、无政府的社会观点给以批判，也有很大的意义，那种观点把资产阶级和无产阶级利益的对立、他们的残酷阶级斗争，当成社会的分裂，当成两个敌对阶级间斩断了一切联系。
    斯大林同志指出：“阶级斗争不管怎样尖锐，是不会引起社会的分裂的。”斯大林同志的这一重要指示，充分揭穿了资产阶级和它的右翼社会党仆从们的虚构，那些人虚构说，工人阶级为反对资本主义奴役而进行的斗争，似乎会导使社会“分裂”和“灭亡”。
    在斯大林同志的新著作中，进一步发展了唯物辩证法和唯物主义认识论的法则。在这些著作中，以新的方法提出关于由一个质态向另一质态过渡的特征、关于发展过程中的跃进、关于革命的、质量的转变的问题。斯大林指示说：从旧的质向新的质过渡的法则，对于分成两个敌对阶级的社会来说，用突变方法是必须的，但是对于没有敌对阶级的社会，则决无必要用突变方法。斯大林的这个指示，鲜明阐述了社会主义社会发展规律性的本质特性，及其对资本主义的伟大历史优越性。马列主义科学的其他规则——关于在发展过程中对立性的统一和斗争、现象的联系和相互制约的学说，关于触觉、感性知觉和思维在人们认识活动中的作用的学说，在斯大林同志的著作中也获得了进一步的发展。

    斯大林的有关语言学诸问题的著作，动员全党、全体干部更加深刻的研究马列主义理论。这些著作要求在苏联科学和文化的全部领域内加强应用马列主义的工作，更加精力蓬勃地与那种把布尔什维主义理论武器庸俗化和低级化的些微现象作斗争，与意识形态中的一切和任何敌视马克思主义的流派和倾向作斗争。斯大林同志极力着重指出苏联科学经过意见斗争、自由批评而日益发展的伟大重要原则，并着重指出必须坚决取消科学界的那种卑劣的军阀式统治的残余。
    斯大林同志以新的规则和归纳补充了布尔什维主义理论武库，从而给苏联人民以新的武器来解决摆在苏维埃国家和光荣布尔什维克党面前的伟大任务。
