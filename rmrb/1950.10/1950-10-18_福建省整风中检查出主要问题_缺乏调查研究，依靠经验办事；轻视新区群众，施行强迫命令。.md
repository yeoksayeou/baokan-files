　　Fujian Province Rectification Reveals Major Problems
    Lack of Investigation and Research, Relying on Experience; Disregarding Masses in New Areas, Implementing Coercive Orders.
    [This Newspaper's Report] The rectification movement of the Fujian Provincial CCP (Communist Party of China) District Committee and organs above the Commissioner's Office, as well as the rectification study of leading cadres at the prefectural, county, and district levels in the Provincial Party School, has largely concluded; the rectification of district and township-level cadres is expected to be completed by the end of this month.

    In the rectification during August and September, the main shortcomings and errors in the leadership at all levels in the province were exposed as the bureaucratic work style of empiricism and administrative routine. This was mainly manifested in the lack of investigation and research into the situation in the new areas, relying on experience in handling affairs, and the lack of specific guidance for lower-level cadres, relying on instructions in handling affairs. Secondly, there was a commanding style of work, with general cadres believing that the masses in the new areas were backward and that it was necessary to force them in order to complete work tasks. As a result, there were bad phenomena such as hanging and beating people, sealing doors, and taking over everything. Some local cadres, because of their desire for revenge, indiscriminately killed bandits. Thirdly, there was a formalistic style of work, satisfied with superficial figures. For example, in rent reduction, the pursuit was for how many townships and villages had rent reduced, and in the development of farmers' associations, the pursuit was simply for the number of people involved. In addition, some cadres also had the mentality of being meritorious officials, were conservative and complacent, cared about their positions, were not at ease in their work, and could not properly help new cadres or unite with non-Party members. Some former local cadres, because of insufficient past education and unremodeled thinking, were dissatisfied with the Party because their "family problems" or other personal problems were not resolved. They said: "The Party uses worker-peasant cadres to win the world, but lets others enjoy the fruits." After analysis, criticism, and patient education in the rectification, the above-mentioned ideological styles have changed. The departments directly under the province are more united and coordinated, and the relationship between higher and lower levels is closer. The Provincial Party School conducted systematic ideological education for former local cadres, which was very effective. Some cadres who received training at the Party School said: "The Provincial Party School should have been established later; many cadres wanted to go home and be ordinary people."

    The Methods of Summarizing Work Are Not Easy to Master; Leaders Must Closely Monitor and Prevent Deviations
    The main experiences gained in this rectification in Fujian Province are: (1) Adhering to the correct policy of rectification and closely monitoring the ideological leadership of Party committees at all levels. This is the only way to prevent deviations. This rectification policy, which improves ideological style by summarizing and examining work from top to bottom, is not fully grasped by everyone. Even if those above understand it, not everyone below understands it, and even if the main departments understand it, not all departments understand it. Therefore, when the rectification leadership of the province shifted from work inspection to various departments, offices, and bureaus, it immediately focused on inspecting the rectification of each unit and the rectification plans of various local committees. During the inspection, it was found that some units had few leading cadres who were scattered and had a lot of work, resulting in the phenomenon of lower-level rectification first and leading cadres later. This violated the principle of rectification from top to bottom. When the Provincial Post Office inspected its work, it did not first unify and concentrate its efforts to inspect the main work of the bureau, but instead mobilized the Party branch, the Youth League branch, and the trade union to conduct inspections downward according to their respective vertical systems. Fuzhou City initially solicited opinions from cadres and non-Party members; as a result, there were many opinions, but few that raised issues of principle. Therefore, it immediately put aside the minor issues and had the leadership summarize the work, correcting this deviation.

    Focus on Major Issues When Inspecting Work; Equally Applicable to Rectification of Cadres Below County Level
    (2) The methods of summarizing and inspecting work generally adopted these two approaches: one is to comprehensively inspect various tasks based on policy style principles. For example, starting from the policy of mobilizing the masses, the work of suppressing bandits, reducing rent, and production is comprehensively inspected. The other is to start from several major tasks in the work assignment, such as suppressing bandits, reducing rent, and production, and conduct inspections item by item. Generally, the latter method is better for the rectification of cadres below the county level. However, county and district cadres easily regard this summary inspection work of the rectification as the same as the general summary work in the past. Therefore, it is necessary to repeatedly explain the significance of inspecting work and rectification, and at the same time, the leadership must analyze and inspect the main advantages and disadvantages of the entire district's work, policies, and styles from top to bottom, combined with mobilizing all cadres to inspect the leadership's instructions and their own implementation from bottom to top. Experience has proven that this method of inspection is successful. General cadres understand that rectification is for the purpose of improving work; the leadership's self-criticism also inspires the general cadres' self-criticism, drawing lessons and closely combining them with new work tasks. Therefore, general cadres have confidence in completing new work tasks. For general office cadres, both methods can be used flexibly. Because the division of labor in general offices is more complex, unlike counties and districts, which have several common major tasks, office cadres often feel that "it is easy to check thoughts, but difficult to check work." Therefore, it should be emphasized that inspections should be carried out from the regular business work and work style of each section and unit, and everyone should not be required to "check the entire work" indiscriminately.

    Reporting Inspection Results to People's Congresses and Other Meetings Is One of the Methods to Consolidate the Achievements of Rectification
    Regarding how to consolidate the achievements of rectification, Fujian Province has put forward two issues that must be resolved at the end of the rectification phase: (1) How to turn the results of the rectification of county and district cadres into a force to promote the masses and improve work in conjunction with new work tasks? The Longyan Prefectural Committee adopted the method of reporting the main results of the inspection of work in the rectification to the representatives at the People's Congresses and the Farmers' Congresses in conjunction with the summer requisition task. This method has achieved good results. Many representatives reflected: "Only a government that truly serves the people can self-criticize in this way," "Many problems are not only the responsibility of the government, but also the responsibility of our representatives." Eighty percent of the representatives expressed their views on the summer requisition: "If we fail to complete the task or do a good job this time, we will all come to the People's Congress to make self-criticisms." (2) How to improve the work of the organs? All departments directly under the province have formulated several necessary work systems based on their self-criticisms. Systems have been established for studying instructions from higher authorities, communicating up and down, collective leadership, and departmental coordination. The spirit of unity and learning enthusiasm that was high during the rectification has been consolidated. Regarding individual self-criticisms, simple rectification summaries are used instead of appraisals, so as not to shift the focus of the rectification to appraisals. Rectification summaries are also not used in the form of small groups or signatures and seals. As for individual cadres with serious ideological problems, they still need patient assistance after the rectification. Individual cadres who still deliberately violate policies and laws after the rectification can be handed over to the Discipline Inspection Committee for disciplinary action.

    Leaders Should Pay Timely Attention to and Correct the Anxious Mood of a Few Cadres to Improve Work
    Due to the shortage of cadres and the large number of tasks in Fujian Province, after the rectification, the leading cadres of some units have an anxious mood to improve work, so they call for fewer cadres, fewer backbones, and fear of making mistakes and failing to complete tasks. The Provincial Party Committee closely monitored this situation, pointing out that the rectification should recognize achievements and experiences, and not simply examine mistakes. In examining mistakes, it is necessary to analyze the reasons and determine improvement methods to prevent the tendency to be constrained after the rectification. In September, the Provincial Party Committee issued instructions on organizational work, emphasizing the training of cadres, boldly mobilizing the masses, implementing rent reduction, and correcting the tendency to not actively lead the peasants in the anti-feudal struggle because of opposition to commandism.

### 福建省整风中检查出主要问题  缺乏调查研究，依靠经验办事；轻视新区群众，施行强迫命令。

　　福建省整风中检查出主要问题
    缺乏调查研究，依靠经验办事；轻视新区群众，施行强迫命令。
    【本报讯】福建省中共地委及专署以上机关的整风运动及省委党校地、县、区主要干部的整风学习已大体结束；区、乡级干部的整风，预计本月底亦可完成。
    在八、九两月份的整风中，暴露出该省各级领导上的主要缺点与错误，是存在着经验主义、事务主义的官僚主义作风。主要表现在对新区情况缺乏调查研究，依靠经验办事，对下面干部缺乏具体指导，依靠指示办事。其次是命令主义作风，一般干部认为新区群众落后，要完成工作任务非硬逼不行。因而发生吊打封门，包办代替等恶劣现象。有的本地干部则因为存在报复思想而乱杀土匪。再次是工作上的形式主义作风，满足于表面数字。如减租则追求减了多少乡、村，发展农会则单纯追求人数。此外，有些干部还存在着功臣思想，保守自满，计较地位，不安心工作，不能好好帮助新干部及团结党外人士等。有些原地方干部因过去教育不够，思想未经改造，因“家庭问题”或其他个人问题得不到解决而对党不满，他们说：“党利用工农干部打天下，就让别人享福。”以上的思想作风经过整风中的分析批判及耐心教育，都有了改变。省直属各部门更加团结协调，上下关系也更加密切。省委党校对原地方干部进行系统的思想教育，收效很大。有些到党校受训的干部说：“省委党校要晚办些，有许多干部要想回家当老百姓去了。”
    总结工作的方法不易掌握领导要抓紧检查防止偏向
    福建省在此次整风中获得的主要经验是：（一）坚持整风正确方针，抓紧检查各级党委的思想领导。这样才能防止偏向。这次从上到下，通过总结检查工作来改进思想作风的整风方针，并不是都能掌握的。上面弄通了，并不是下面都弄通了，主要部门弄通了，并不是所有部门都弄通了。因此，省的整风领导上在工作检查转入各部、厅、局时，即抓紧检查各单位的整风及各地委的整风计划。在检查中发现：有的单位因领导干部少而分散，工作多，产生了下边先整，领导干部后整的现象。这就违反了由上而下的整风原则。省邮局检查工作时，不是首先统一集中力量检查局的主要工作，而是发动党支部、团支部、职工会各按垂直系统向下检查。福州市开始即向干部和党外人士征求意见；结果意见繁多，而提到原则问题的很少。因而立即撇开枝节问题，由领导总结工作，纠正了这一偏向。
    检查工作要抓住主要问题县以下干部整风同样适用
    （二）总结与检查工作的方式，大体上采用了这两种：一种是从政策作风原则出发来综合检查各项工作。例如从发动群众的政策出发，把剿匪、减租、生产工作综合起来检查。一种是从工作任务中的几个主要工作出发，如剿匪、减租、生产，逐项进行检查。一般县以下干部的整风，以后一种方法较好。但县、区干部很容易把这次整风的总结检查工作看成和过去一般的总结工作一样，因此，必须反复说明检查工作及整风的意义，同时领导上要由上而下地分析检查全区工作上、政策上、作风上的主要优缺点，结合发动全体干部由下而上地检查领导的指示及本身的执行情况。经验证明，用这种办法来检查是成功的。一般干部明白了整风是为了改进工作；因领导上的检讨，也启发了一般干部的检讨，得出了经验，又和新的工作任务密切结合起来。因此，使一般干部对完成新的工作任务有了信心。一般机关干部，则两种方法可以灵活运用。一般机关因分工较复杂，不像县、区一样有几个共同的主要任务，机关干部往往会觉得“查思想容易，查工作困难。”因此，应强调从各科、股的经常业务工作、工作作风去检查，而不能无分别地要每个人都“检查整个工作”。
    向人代会等报告检查结果是巩固整风成果方法之一
    关于如何巩固整风成果，福建省提出了在整风结束阶段必需解决的两个问题：（一）怎样把县、区干部的整风结果，结合新的工作任务变成推动群众、改进工作的力量？龙岩地委采用人民代表会和农代会议的方式，把整风中检查工作的主要结果结合夏征任务向代表们作报告，这种办法收到很好的效果。许多代表反映：“只有真正为人民办事的政府，才能这样地自我批评”，“许多毛病不单政府要负责，我们代表也要负责”。有百分之八十的代表对夏征表示：“这次如果完不成任务或作不好，再开人代会我们都来检讨。”（二）怎样改进机关工作？省直属各机关都从检讨中订出若干必要的工作制度。如研究上级指示、上下通气、集体领导、部门联系等方面，都订了制度。把整风中高涨的团结精神与学习情绪巩固了下来。关于个人检查，则采用简单的整风总结，不作鉴定看待，以免将整风中心转移到鉴定上去。整风总结亦不用小组和大家签名盖章的方式。至于个别思想问题严重的干部，整风后还须耐心帮助，个别干部，如整风后仍然故意违反政策法令，则可交给纪律检查委员会执行纪律。
    少数干部改进工作的急躁情绪领导上要及时注意防止与纠正
    福建省由于干部少，任务多，在整风后，若干单位的领导干部有一种急躁的改进工作的情绪，因而叫干部少，骨干少，怕犯错误完不成任务。该省省委密切注意了此种情况，指出整风中要认识成绩、经验，不要单纯检讨错误，在检讨错误中，要分析原因，定出改进办法。以防止整风后产生束手束脚的偏向。九月份，该省省委又发出组织工作的指示，强调培养干部，放手发动群众，贯彻减租，纠正因为反对命令主义因而不积极领导农民反封建斗争的偏向。
