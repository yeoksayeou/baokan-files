　　The Evil Consequences of Jinan Railway Factory Not Relying on the Masses
    Production Tasks Cannot Be Completed, and Rework and Waste Are Serious
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Jinan Railway Factory failed to complete its production tasks for the second quarter. The locomotive overhaul plan was originally for 27 units (equivalent to 21 major overhauls), but only 20 units were actually completed (equivalent to 16 major overhauls), completing 76% of the task. The passenger car overhaul plan was originally for 23 cars, but only 13 cars were actually completed, completing only 56% of the task.
    There are many reasons why the factory's production tasks were not completed. The factory leadership has serious bureaucratic work styles. Leading cadres do not go deep into the workshops; they assign work without checking or supervising; the system is not fully established, and no one investigates the reasons for failure to complete tasks. Vehicle entry inspections, intermediate inspections, factory exit inspections, and cost inspections are not thorough, resulting in poor work quality; continuous rework and repairs waste manpower and materials. Rework on passenger and freight cars accounts for 25% of the total monthly work hours. The main reason is lax inspection or no inspection at all. After a car is repaired, defects are found during inspection, requiring disassembly and rework; after rework, the inspector deems it unsatisfactory, requiring further repair; after the car leaves the factory and arrives at the depot, it fails to meet standards upon inspection and must be returned to the factory for rework. Freight cars "256729" and "55294" were sent out and returned to the factory three times, with rework delaying them for more than a month. When repairing locomotive "1562," rework was required four times due to faulty springs. In the foundry workshop, 56 axle box inner ears were cast in March and April, all short by 4 to 5 millimeters. The pattern-making team made wooden patterns that did not meet standards, but the foundry workshop负责人负责人 did not notice it, and the finished products were still not discovered. When they were sent to the passenger and freight car workshops for installation, the passenger and freight car workshops also failed to inspect them, and the problem was only discovered during vehicle inspection after repair and before leaving the factory.
    The factory's monthly production plan is unclear, only specifying the number of cars to be repaired, and it does not match the actual situation. The production plan is not given to the workers for discussion, and the leadership randomly issues work order responsibilities, causing chaos below and preventing work from proceeding according to procedure. Workers work hard but cannot complete the task, and they do not know how much work they need to do in a month to complete the plan. The vehicle repair schedule is not fixed, resulting in a serious phenomenon of "entering the factory without starting work, starting work without finishing, finishing work without leaving the factory, and returning to the factory after leaving." For example, when repairing locomotives "1872" and "1663" from the Fangzi Locomotive Depot, medium repairs were originally specified. After inspection by the workers, the damage was sufficient for major repairs, and they immediately reported it to the factory affairs section for instructions. The locomotive affairs section discussed it for a long time, resulting in a delay of two months in the departure time. Every month, two or three locomotives are delayed in repair time due to unfixed repair schedules. Locomotive "1517" from the Hefei Locomotive Depot entered the factory on June 26th, and the locomotive affairs section designated the repair of the left cylinder piston. The Jinan Railway Bureau limited the completion of the repair to July 10th. The workers actively disassembled and repaired it, only to find that there was nothing wrong with the left cylinder. The workers telegraphed the factory affairs section for instructions, and the reply was: "It may be a mistake, it's probably the right cylinder." In order to repair the car on time, the cylinder team workers worked overtime and completed the repair on July 8th. However, the car remained in the factory and did not leave until September. Workers reflected, "This is a car that urgently needed repair, but it has been left here until now!" According to incomplete statistics for May and June, in addition to the number of days of construction in the factory, the number of days waiting for repair, waiting for testing, waiting for delivery, and staying in the factory for 12 locomotives reached 229 days. Jinan Locomotive Depot's locomotive "1577" entered the factory for major repairs on December 28th of last year and left the factory on February 28th of this year. Due to the frame being crooked and the wheel flange deviating, it re-entered the factory for repairs. Due to limited mechanical equipment in the factory, it needed to be sent to the Tangshan Railway Factory for further repairs. Due to delays in official correspondence, it was not sent to the Tangshan factory until July 31st. It stayed in the Jinan factory for 155 days. Freight car "364675" entered the factory for repairs on November 15th of last year. Due to corrosion of the car beams, the workers repeatedly requested instructions on how to repair it, but the leadership has not yet made a decision, and it has remained in the factory for more than 260 days (nearly nine months) and has not yet left.
    Due to the serious bureaucratic work style of the factory leadership, not only are car repairs not completed on time, but manpower, materials, and work hours are wasted significantly, increasing the cost of freight car repairs.
    The factory's labor organization is unreasonable. For example, in the tube team of the boiler workshop, two teams with a total of 32 people actually work together. Based on the current tasks, only 20 people are needed to complete the task, including disassembly, assembly, and repair. Only three people are needed in the upper tube team, but there are eight people in the team, making it crowded and difficult to work. Workers in the auto department of the machine tool workshop do not know what to do in the afternoon after finishing their work in the morning. The oil and mud team in the locomotive workshop has only five people, all of whom are old. In addition to their own work, they also have to haul coal, fetch water, and carry coal ash, leaving them with no time to rest. The oxygen station has an authorized strength of 34 people, but only 26 people are actually there, making it difficult to manage. When someone takes leave, the work is affected. The leadership neither rewards nor commends (and rewards are rare and not timely) workshops and teams that actively complete or exceed tasks; they also do not inquire about those who fail to complete tasks. For example, the power workshop's generator has not had an accident in two years; the boiler used to burn 12 tons of coal per day, but now it has been reduced to 8 tons; Zhao Yunbiao in the machine workshop used to turn out more than 300 screws a day, but now he has increased it to 1,000. None of these have been rewarded. The passenger and freight car workshop overhauled five passenger cars in July, but none of them left the factory, and the reason was not inquired about. Workers reflected that "good and bad are not distinguished, the leadership is blind." The factory's administration, Party, labor union, and youth league are not coordinated. On the surface, their work is consistent, but in reality, everyone is busy with their own affairs. When discussing and deciding on central tasks, everyone's opinions are inconsistent. The administration wants to find work, the Party branch wants to clear capital, the labor union wants to establish a management committee, and the youth league wants to sign apprenticeship contracts. Each has its own set of priorities and cannot coordinate with each other. Production tasks are not completed one after another, but the reasons are not well studied. The factory's labor union has never been concerned about production, does not even know the monthly production tasks, and is busy all day with trivial "welfare" affairs such as distributing wood flowers and coal ash. Many suggestions from workers that are conducive to production have not been well resolved.
    Now the factory leadership has reviewed the above shortcomings and is studying ways to overcome them, determined to change its past style, listen to workers' opinions, and implement democratic management. It also plans to launch a new record creation movement and a rationalization proposal movement in order to bring into play the enthusiasm and wisdom of employees in production. It resolutely opposes rework and waste, and first seeks to determine quotas for labor, materials, and norms in the locomotive, machine, and forging workshops in a focused manner, and then promote it throughout the factory. All employees of the factory have warmly responded to these measures, and some workshops and teams have already signed contact contracts and guarantee covenants. In addition to drawing up their own covenant, the Cheng Jishun team in the machine workshop has also challenged the entire factory.

　　济南铁路工厂不依靠群众的恶果
    生产任务不能完成反工浪费现象严重
    【本报讯】济南铁路工厂第二季生产任务没有完成。机车检修计划原为二十七台（折合大修二十一台），实际完成二十台（折合大修十六台），完成任务百分之七十六。客车检修计划原为二十三辆，实际完成十三辆，完成任务仅百分之五十六。
    该厂生产任务没有完成的原因很多。该厂领导上存在着严重的官僚主义作风，领导干部不深入车间；布置了工作，不检查也不督促；制度建立不齐全，完不成任务也不追究原因。车辆入厂检查，中间检查，出厂检查，成本检查等工作都作得不彻底，因而工作质量不高；不断反工回修，浪费人力物力。客货车场的反工活占全月工数百分之二十五。主要原因是检查不严或没有检查。车修好了，才检查出有毛病，拆了重修；重修后验收员认为不行，还要再修；车出厂到段上，检验不够标准，再进厂重修。货车“二五六七二九”号及“五五二九四”号曾经三次出厂入厂，反工拖延一个多月。修“一五六二”号机车时，因弹簧不好，反工四次。铸工场三四两月间铸五十六个轴箱内耳，全短四至五米厘。木型班所制木型不合标准，铸工场负责人没有发现，作出成品仍未发觉。送到客货车场装车时，客货车场也未检查，直到修完出厂验车时，才把这个毛病检查出来。
    该厂每月生产计划不明确，只规定修车台数，且与实际情况不合。生产计划不交给工人讨论，领导上又乱下工作责任单，闹的下面手忙脚乱，不能按程序进行工作。工友干活不少，就是完不成任务，不知道一个月作多少才算完成计划。车辆修程不定，造成“进厂不开工，开工不完工，完工不出厂，出厂又入厂”的严重现象。如修坊子机务段“一八七二”号与“一六六三”号机车时，原来规定中修。经工友检查，损坏情形已够大修程度，当即申报厂务处请示。机务处讨论很久，结果耽延出厂时间达两个月。每月总有两三台机车因修程不定耽误修理时间。合肥机务段“一五一七”号机车是六月二十六日进厂，机务处指定检修左汽缸鞲?，济南局限于七月十日修完。工友积极动手拆修，发现左汽缸并无毛病。工友以电话向厂务处请示，回答是：“可能写错，大概是右汽缸吧。”汽缸班工友为了按时把车修好，加紧赶工，于七月八日修完。但该车停在厂内，直到九月才出厂。工友反映：“这是急需修的车，修好竟放到现在！”据五、六月份不完全的统计，十二台机车除在厂施工日数外，待修、待试、待交、停厂日数，足达二百二十九天。济南机务段“一五七七”号机车是去年十二月二十八日入厂大修，今年二月二十八日出厂。因车架不正，轮缘飘偏，重新入厂修理。该厂限于机械设备，需送唐山铁路工厂加修。由于公文往返耽搁，直至七月三十一日才送到唐山工厂。在济厂停放了一五五天。货车“三六四六七五”号于去年十一月十五日入厂修理，因车梁腐蚀，工友一再请示如何修法，领导上迄未决定，在厂停留二百六十多天（近九个月）尚未出厂。
    由于该厂领导上有严重官僚主义作风，不但修车不能按时完成，且人力、物力、工时浪费很严重，增加了货车检修成本。
    该厂劳动组织不合理，如锅炉场管子班，两个班共三十二人，实际是一起干活，以现有任务计算，连拆装带修理，有二十人即能完成任务。上管班三个人就可以了，但该班有八个人，拥挤不开，不好干活。工机场汽车部工友干完上午的活，下午就不知道干什么。机车场油泥班只五个人，都是年老的，除自己工作外，还得上煤，上水，抬煤灰，连一点休息时间都没有。氧气场定员三十四人，实有二十六人，照顾不过来，有人请假，工作就受影响。领导上对于积极完成或超过任务的场、班，既不奖励又不表扬（奖也很少，不及时）；对完不成任务的，也不过问。如动力场发电机两年没出过事故；锅炉烧煤过去每天烧十二吨，现减至八吨；机械场赵云彪套螺丝，过去一天出三百多，现在提高到一千。这些都未奖励。客货车场七月份检修客车五台，一台都未出厂，也不问其原因。工友反映说“好坏不分，瞎领导”。该厂行政、党、工、团配合不协调，表面上是工作一致，实际上各忙各的。在讨论和决定中心工作时，大家意见不一致，行政上要找工，支部要清资，工会要成立管委会，青年团要订师徒合同，各有各的一套，互相不能配合。生产任务接二连三完不成，又不很好的研究原因。大厂工会对生产从来不关心，连每月生产任务都不知道，整天忙于发木花、煤灰等琐碎“福利”事务。工友提出很多有利于生产的建议，都未很好解决。
    现在该厂领导上对于上述缺点已作检讨，并研究克服办法，决心转变以往作风，听取工人意见，贯彻民主管理。并拟开展创造新纪录运动及合理化建议运动，以便发挥职工在生产上的热情与智慧。坚决反对反工浪费，首先有重点地在机车、机械、锻工三场求出定工、定料、定额，再推动全厂。全厂职工热烈响应这些办法，有的场、班已订出联系合同与保证公约。机械场程继顺组除自己订立公约外，并向全厂挑战。
