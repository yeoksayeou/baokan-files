Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 7th. The Northwest's first Literary and Art Workers Congress, an unprecedented great unity of literary and art workers from all ethnic groups in the Northwest, was held in Xi'an from September 21st to 30th. The Northwest Federation of Literary and Art Circles was also formally established. The congress elected 75 formal members and 15 alternate members, including Ke Zhongping, Lu Zhi (Director of the Propaganda Department of the Political Department of the First Field Army), and Ziya (Uyghur, Director of the Literary and Art Department of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government). The congress discussed and determined the guiding principles and tasks for developing literary and art work in the Northwest.

Eight delegations from various provinces, cities, and the military attended the congress, including 383 literary and art worker representatives from eleven ethnic groups. In addition, more than 400 people from various ethnic song and dance troupes, local cultural work troupes, and visiting groups attended as observers and performed various programs for the congress. The representatives brought more than 3,000 valuable literary and artistic works from various ethnic groups for the congress to exhibit.

The congress summarized the experience of literary and art work in the Northwest region in the year since liberation and emphasized that the people's literary movement in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in the past, under the personal guidance and cultivation of Chairman Mao, represented the correct direction of the Chinese people's literary movement and achieved brilliant results. This glorious tradition should be carried forward in the future.

The congress determined that literary and art work in the Northwest must serve the current general political task of the Northwest people, which is to "complete land reform in a planned and step-by-step manner, develop production, and build the Northwest into an industrial and national defense base for New China." It must faithfully serve the economic, political, and cultural construction of the Northwest people. At the current stage, it should complete the following tasks: First, to organize the creation movement in a planned and guided manner, reflecting the diverse struggles of various ethnic groups according to different regions, different tasks, and diverse themes. Second, to develop mass literary and art movements. In cities, cultural work troupes with exemplary roles should be the core, so that amateur literary and art activities are closely integrated with professional literary and art activities. In rural areas, folk literary and art activities should be organized extensively using Spring Festival temple fairs. In the future, the military's literary and art work should concentrate manpower on creation, and combat-experienced and culturally accomplished commanders and fighters should be mobilized to participate. Military cultural work troupes should go deep into the companies and continue to carry out the "soldiers perform for soldiers" movement. Third, to quickly mobilize the approximately 25,000 folk artists in the Northwest region to serve the people. Ideological transformation and concrete assistance should be combined for them. Necessary support should be given to theatrical troupes that have achieved relatively good results.

The congress focused on discussing how to develop literary and art work among various brotherly ethnic groups, pointing out that it is necessary to grasp the New Democratic literary and artistic content and adopt a policy of gradual improvement on the basis of friendship and unity among all ethnic groups. To this end, the congress determined that it will strive to unite and rely on literary and art workers from various brotherly ethnic groups, carry forward the excellent traditions of literature and art from various brotherly ethnic groups, further vigorously cultivate literary and art cadres from various ethnic groups, translate and publish literary and artistic works from various ethnic groups, and use this to promote the unity of various ethnic groups.

　　西北举行首届文代大会
    号召发扬过去陕甘宁边区人民文艺运动的正确方向，并讨论开展各兄弟民族的文艺工作问题。
    【新华社西安七日电】西北各民族文艺工作者空前大团结的西北首届文学艺术工作者代表大会，已于九月二十一日至三十日在西安举行，西北文学艺术界联合会同时宣告正式成立。大会选出柯仲平、鲁直（第一野战军政治部宣传部部长）、孜牙（维族、新疆省人民政府文教委员会文艺处处长）等七十五名正式委员暨十五名候补委员。大会讨论并确定了开展西北文艺工作的方针和任务。
    出席这次大会的有各省市及部队等八个代表团，包括十一个民族的文艺工作者代表三百八十三人，另有各民族的歌舞团，各地的文工团、参观团等四百余人列席，并为大会演出各种节目。各代表从各地带来各民族珍贵的文艺作品三千余件，供大会展览。
    这次大会总结了西北地区解放一年来文艺工作的经验，并着重地指出了过去陕甘宁边区的人民文艺运动在毛主席亲自指导和培养下，是代表着中国人民文艺运动的正确方向并获得了光辉的成绩的，今后更应发扬这个光荣的传统。
    大会确定西北文艺工作必须服务于当前西北人民总的政治任务，即“有步骤地完成土地改革，发展生产，把西北建设成为新中国的工业与国防基地”，必须忠诚地服务于西北人民的经济、政治、文化建设事业，而在现阶段则应完成下列各项任务：第一是有计划有领导地组织创作运动。按照不同的地区，不同的任务，多样的主题，反映各民族多样的斗争生活。其次是发展群众文艺运动，在城市内应以有示范作用的文工团为核心，使业余文艺活动与职业文艺活动密切结合。在农村应广泛利用春节赛会，组织民间文艺活动。部队文艺今后应集中人力从事创作，并须发动有战斗经验和有文艺修养的指战员参加。部队文工团应深入连队，继续开展“兵演兵”运动。第三是迅速地动员西北区为数约达二万五千的民间艺人，使之为人民服务。对于他们，思想改造和具体帮助要互相结合。对于较有成绩的剧团应给予必要的支持。
    大会着重地讨论了如何开展各兄弟民族的文艺工作问题，指出必须在各民族友爱团结的基础上，掌握新民主主义的文艺内容，采取逐步改进的方针。为此，大会确定今后将努力团结并依赖各兄弟民族文艺工作者，发扬各兄弟民族文学艺术的优秀传统，进一步大力培养各民族文艺干部，译印各民族的文艺作品，并以此推动各民族的团结。
