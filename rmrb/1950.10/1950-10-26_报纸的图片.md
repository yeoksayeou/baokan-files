　　Newspaper Pictures
    Wo'erqike
    Using photographs as illustrations in newspapers is a very important matter. Therefore, some mistakes in this area should be discussed to help avoid them.
    Preparation and organization of photography are important parts of photographic reporting. But it is not always possible to take pictures during the intense workday of an enterprise or individual producer – one cannot pull a producer away from their most critical moment just for a photo, etc. It is a good way to rationally organize photography to arrange things in advance, informing the relevant comrades about the photography and the location beforehand. However, this has nothing in common with repeated rehearsals. False rehearsal methods, which are not appropriate for a Soviet newspaper, should be resolutely rejected. We have no reason to create fabricated scenes, fictional situations, or "organize" untrue scenes. Any contrivance, any tendency to deviate from reality should be resolutely criticized by editors. Rehearsed photographs, if they happen to appear in the newspaper, will only cause readers' justifiable disappointment and displeasure. The skills of a photojournalist should be honed to be able to take all necessary photos for the newspaper in any difficult environment, without violating the principle of truthfulness.
    Due to the inability to distinguish the foreground in photos, some photography correspondents attempt to achieve this mechanically, inserting people from other pictures into their photos. Efforts must be made to ensure that everything is photographed, all on one negative and one photo. A newspaper photo is a kind of certificate; it is not good if this certificate is composed of different parts.
    One should guard against picture group staff being misled by artificial beauty. Unfortunately, some photographers still believe that, for example, branches can decorate any photo. In these photographers' photos, the appearance of trees is often unnecessary and meaningless. Pictures should be truly beautiful, artistic. But the beauty spoken of here is not fabricated, but natural, an inherent characteristic organically complementing the photographed object.
    When assembling backgrounds, mistakes often occur due to the carelessness of some photographers. Newspaper editorial departments must pay the utmost attention to this, ensuring that each photographer does not allow the same person, machine, or house to appear twice in the same background photo when assembling backgrounds. These things happen because, when assembling backgrounds, a photo is often pasted onto another photo in the same part of the photo. The greatest attention must be paid here.
    The wording of various propaganda posters and banners included in the picture must also be carefully read. Sometimes the photo itself is good, but the slogan in the photo has calligraphic errors. If the photo cannot be modified, it should be discarded. If such oversights appear in the newspaper, they will inevitably arouse readers' indignation.
    These are the most typical mistakes in newspaper picture work. These mistakes can be avoided. This requires constant and utmost attention, and genuine vigilance when selecting photos for the newspaper.

    Besides photos, other descriptive materials can be used to decorate the newspaper.
    Illustrations. Newspapers, especially special holiday editions, often publish various illustrations, sketches, and portraits by artists on different subjects.
    Needless to say, illustrations or portraits intended to be published in the newspaper should be skillfully made and have a high level of artistic merit. They should also meet certain technical requirements arising from the characteristics of the newspaper.
    It should be remembered that pencil drawings, in particular, do not print well in zinc etchings and are therefore not suitable for newspapers. The best illustrations for newspapers are those made with ink pens, steel pens, lead pencils, or watercolors, and should have clear contrast between light and dark. Newspaper illustrations should not use pictures with very light colors.
    Reproductions. This method of reproduction (mainly referring to photographs) should only be used when the newspaper editorial department can entrust it to skilled artists. This method is often used in situations where the newspaper editorial department does not have a good engraving department and cannot produce excellent (halftone) engravings. In this case, the photographs prepared for publication are best drawn with fine lines, creating outline zinc etchings, which can usually be printed clearly.
    Stills. These illustrations are most effective in enlivening theater reviews. Two or three portraits of actors in costumes and makeup can well supplement the reviews published in the newspaper, making the article lively and impressive. However, these pictures can of course only be completed if there are skilled artists in the editorial department or among the editorial activists.
    International affairs cartoons. Our newspapers have many brilliant cartoonists, whose names are familiar not only at home but also abroad. The cartoons of the Kukryniksy, Boris Yefimov and others are the sharpest materials used to oppose our enemies – instigators of war and representatives of the reactionary forces of imperialism – and to expose politics.
    Undoubtedly, there are cartoonists in every locality. It is necessary to find them, attract them to participate in newspaper work, and at the same time ensure that they are given technical guidance and assistance. It should not be forgotten that creating cartoons for international news is a difficult task, which can only be accomplished under the close connection between experienced cartoonists and international news reporters and newspaper leaders.
    Domestic affairs cartoons. Every domestic affairs cartoon should be drawn sharply, with high technical skill, from the perspective of knowledge of the subject and object, and from an artistic point of view. Here, the artist should not have blatant satire and insult of the shortcomings of the person being ridiculed. Otherwise, the cartoon will lose its purpose. Bad cartoons often need a long text and a long string of captions to supplement and explain them; such cartoons cannot fully achieve their purpose of exposure and satire.
    Maps. These are primarily suitable for international commentaries, but can also be used as illustrations for domestic affairs articles; especially recently, maps have also been published in essays, such as those on the organization of crop rotation. These maps give a concept of the correct layout of planting in collective farm fields; they are a document of great power that can convey the advanced, well-organized experience of management to those who are lagging behind.
    Tables and diagrams. These are used in newspapers as illustrations for essays on economic issues, as materials to more clearly explain the situation of a certain production area. Simple and clear tables and diagrams can help readers analyze complex materials about the development of an economic sector, about the trends of this development, etc., more quickly and deeply.
    Halftone zinc-etched title paintings, decorations and pattern paintings. These are used to emphasize this or that documentary material on each page, dividing it into fixed columns, so that readers are accustomed to finding the newspaper's columns by the daily repeating title paintings. This allows readers to find the materials they need on each page more quickly. Newspapers often have title paintings for these columns, such as the "Overview of the Soviet State" page, and the titles of each column are: "New Books," "Chess," "Sports," etc.
            ×          ×         ×
    How can we better organize the layout of newspapers? Soviet newspaper practice has accumulated a wealth of experience in this regard.
    The first page usually publishes photos of party and government leaders, photos of outstanding representatives of the Soviet people who have received government awards and achieved outstanding achievements in their work, as well as photos of various large and small celebrations, etc. The first page also publishes large photos illustrating the labor in the collective farm fields during the sowing and harvesting seasons, photos of new factories and workshops, or other illustrative materials suitable for certain essays and news in the "Overview of the Soviet State" column.
    Most of the second and third pages of the newspaper are used to publish materials on domestic life in the Soviet Union. Any format of illustration can be used here, as long as it can coordinate with and supplement the documentary material. Illustrations with simple explanatory captions can also have their own independent themes that are not related to the documentary material.
    The fourth page of the newspaper is usually used to publish international materials, and sometimes essays and reports on theater, sports, etc. This page is suitable for publishing international affairs cartoons and sports and theater photos.
    Here, we should also pay attention to a small detail, namely the arrangement of copper engravings on each page. One should avoid the position of the copper engraving on one page "coinciding" with the position of the copper engraving on the corresponding back page of the newspaper, that is, the first and second pages or the third and fourth pages coinciding. If the positions of the copper engravings coincide, for example, the copper engraving on the second page of the newspaper "coincides" with the picture or photo on the first page, the image in the picture or photo will be unclear as a result.
    Here, we will present a standard diagram for arranging picture manuscripts on each page of the newspaper. However, it should not be concluded from this that newspapers must only adhere to this diagram. Every editorial department should try to find its "own" layout characteristics, but these characteristics should not be the result of a rough accumulation of pictures on each page. The problem is not the quantity, but the quality of the pictures and the appropriate arrangement of the pictures on the newspaper. Some editorial staff members pursue the quantity of illustrations and develop a large number of small copper engravings on each page, but these drawings are often very bad and sometimes completely incomprehensible to readers; this approach is not right.
    Now, let's talk briefly about so-called special issues. These special issues have a special nature, and it is best if the materials of the special issue are specially prepared photos. It is appropriate to send photojournalists to the places where this basic documentary material is created for this purpose. Such an arrangement will more clearly and convincingly emphasize the direction of the special issue and increase interest in it.
    The special issue of the newspaper can have a drawn, zinc-etched title painting – the "header."
          ×            ×          ×
    The expressiveness and clarity of newspaper pictures are mostly related to the quality of copper engravings. This work should be entrusted to skilled photo retouchers.
    The retoucher has the mission of "processing" the copy photo (the printed photo and proof) in order to make a copper engraving. The mission of retouching is to enhance the photo while removing some superfluous odds and ends, any technical defects (spots, scratches), and defects that appear on the picture due to the negligence or lack of skill of the photographer (uneven lighting). However, retouching itself also contains many dangers. Technically inadequate retouching sometimes does not improve, but worsens or even destroys the photo.
    When retouching photos printed on glossy (textured or non-textured) paper, it is best to use a magnification of one and a half times larger than that used for newspaper engraving. When the photo is made into a copper engraving and appropriately reduced, many of the "traces" that are inevitable during retouching will disappear, and the copper engraving will be made better. It is not good if the photo original used for engraving is not reduced but enlarged, "stretched." In this case, the traces of retouching are easily visible, the copper engraving appears rough, and the picture is often ruined. The retoucher should first "process" the photo with an ink pen or retouching knife (removing white areas, deepening areas of strong light).
    The use of lead powder should be avoided, because its characteristic is to fade, creating white spots in some areas where there should be no white spots. When using lead powder, if it is impossible to use a retouching knife, the retoucher should be especially careful, repairing the surface of the photo very carefully, smoothly, and without alternating between light and heavy. Backlit and therefore dark photos must be carefully "coated" with a very thin layer of very fine lead powder in the dark areas. After the photo has been processed in this way, the plate made is very glossy and suitable for printing.
    Newspaper editorial departments should keep in mind this rule: a high degree of quality must be achieved in every small part of the photo original, and in no case should one hope that the errors of retouching "will not" appear on the lead plate, or hope that they will be "corrected" during engraving. It is much more difficult to correct the defects of an image on a metal plate than on a photo original. Therefore, before the original is sent for engraving, the editorial staff should carefully check the retouching themselves.
    Newspaper editorial departments must listen to all the wishes of the engraving department regarding the nature of retouching. The legitimate technical requirements put forward by the engraving department should be met immediately.
    Within the scope of this lecture, it is impossible to study all the technical problems of engraving in their entirety. We will only mention a few issues that are meaningful for supervising engraving work.
    After the copper engraving is made, the engraving department should submit a copper engraving proof to the editorial department. The proof is the basic inspection certificate, and the editorial department judges the quality of the copper engraving based on these proofs.
    If the photo submitted to the engraving department is clear and has good contrast between light and dark, but the copper engraving proof is monotonous and dull, this proves that either the original was not truthfully made into a copper engraving, or the copper engraving was not well corroded. Such a copper engraving should, of course, be discarded immediately. Sometimes a poorly corroded copper engraving can be modified, but it is best to do it again; there is rarely any luck here.
    If the copper engraving made from a normal (with soft shadows) photo original has strong black-and-white contrast – this means that the photo was distorted when making the copper engraving and was not correctly contrasted. A copper engraving like this, which looks authentic at first glance, will print very badly and very "blurred" in the newspaper, and must be remade.
    In order to check copper engraving proofs, every editorial department should have a good magnifying glass. Checking proofs – this is not only to check whether they are similar to the original, but also to carefully examine whether there are any scratches or defects on the copper engraving, etc.
    Editorial departments should create a technical foundation for the photographers working in their newspapers. It is not permissible for photographers to retouch negatives themselves or print under semi-handicraft conditions at home.
    Newspaper editorial departments should have a photography laboratory that is small but has the necessary materials, equipment, etc. A good resource that can help the editorial department's photography work is Mikulin's photography manual, "Modern Photography." It contains a lot of useful knowledge about the standards for material consumption and the chemical drugs necessary for photography work.
    Photographers must hand over the negatives of photos taken on behalf of the newspaper to the editorial department, to a specially established photo storage department, where these materials will be stored in accordance with the national rules stipulated for this purpose. Of course, it is not necessary to store all the negatives in the storage department, and this is not stipulated by any rules. The editorial department should choose those negatives that can be published in the newspaper or will be valuable in the future.
    Copyright laws apply to photographers, just like creators, and editorial departments must strictly abide by these laws. But no photographer may dispose of negatives without the consent of the editorial department.

    We have briefly given a general description of the basic tasks of newspaper editorial departments in inspecting picture work.
    Readers have the right to demand that every newspaper looks good, that vivid pictures supplement documentary materials, and that the pictures published in the newspaper are of full value, and the issue of pictures and newspaper layout should not be regarded as a secondary, purely technical issue. It must always be remembered that pictures, like any manuscript in the newspaper, can help our newspapers fulfill their task as fighting Bolshevik propagandists, agitators and organizers.

　　报纸的图片
    沃尔契克
    用照片来作报纸插图——这是一件十分重要的事情，因此，应当谈一谈这方面的某些错误，以便帮助避免它们。
    准备和组织摄影——是摄影采访工作的重要部分。但并不是常常能够在一个企业或个别生产者的紧张工作日去拍照——不能为了拍照把生产者从最紧张的时刻抽出来等等。要预先商量好，事前告诉约好的同志关于摄影的事情及拍照地点——这是摄影的合理组织的有利方法。但是这与一次又一次的排演毫无共同之处。虚伪的，不是苏维埃报纸所应有的那种排演方法应当受到坚决的斥责。我们这里没有理由来创造杜撰的画面、虚构的情景，来“组织”不真实的场面。任何牵强，任何脱离真实的倾向都应该受到编辑工作者的坚决的批评。排演出来的拍照，假若它偶然出现在报纸上时，那么除了引起读者理所当然的失望和不快以外，不会获得其他。摄影记者的技术正应该受这样的锻炼——善于在任何困难的环境下，以不破坏真实性的原则为报纸摄制一切必要的照片。
    由于不善于在照片中划分前景，有些摄影通讯员便企图机械地来达到这点，他们把别的画面中的人物装进自己的照片中。必须努力使一切都是拍照来的，都是在一张底片和一张照片上的。报纸的照片——是一种凭证，假若这种凭证是由不同的部分构成的，那就不好了。
    应该预防图片组的工作人员迷惑于伪装的美。可惜仍旧有些摄影记者认为：比如说，树枝能够装饰任何照片。在这些摄影记者的照片中，树木的出现常常是没有必要而且毫无意义的。图片应该是真正美丽的，艺术的。但这里所说的图片的美丽并不是虚构出来的，而是自然的，与拍照对象有机地衬托出来的固有的特性。
    在配贴背景时，常常由于某些摄影记者工作粗心而产生错误。报纸编辑部必须最谨慎地注意这点，使每一个摄影记者在配贴背景时不要在同一张背景的照片上两次出现同一个人物，同一个机器和房舍等。所以发生这些，是因为配贴背景时常常在照片的同一部分把一张照片贴在另一张照片上。这里必须给与最大的注意。
    对摄入画面中的各种宣传画及横幅标语的辞句亦必须注意地念一念。有时是照片本身很好，可是照片中的标语却有书法上的错误。假若照片不能修改的话，应当剔除它。诸如此类的疏忽，假若出现在报纸上时，必然引起读者的愤慨。
    这就是报纸图片工作中的最典型的错误。这些错误是可以避免的。为此需要经常用最大的注意，在为报纸选择照片时真正加以警惕。
          ×           ×      ×
    除了照片以外还有其他描写的材料可以用来装饰报纸。
    插画。报纸，特别是节日专刊，常常登载艺术家们所作的各种题材不同的插画，素描和画像。
    不用说，预定要登载在报纸上的插画或画像应该作得很技巧，具有高度的艺术水平。它也应该符合由报纸特点所产生的一定的技术上的要求。
    应该记住，特别是铅笔画制铜锌版印不好，因此亦不宜于报纸。报纸所用的插画最好是用墨笔、钢笔、黑铅笔或水彩画的，而且要阴阳分明。报纸插画不应该选用色彩很淡的图画。
    摹画。只有在报纸编辑部能够委托熟练的艺术家时才采用这种摹画（主要是指的像片）。这种方法常常是在这种场合采用：即当报纸编辑部没有好的制版部，不能够制出优良的（网纹）铜版的时候。在这种情况下，准备登载的照片最好用细线条画，作成轮廓的线条锌版，这样通常是可以印得清楚的。
    剧照。这种插图最能使剧评生动。两三幅穿着戏装化装好的演员的画像可以很好地补充报纸所登载的评论，使这篇稿子生动而予人印象深刻。但是这些图画当然只有在编辑部里或编辑部积极分子中有熟练的艺术家时才能完成。
    国际问题的漫画。我们的报刊有着许多光辉的漫画大家，他们的名字不仅在国内，就是在国外亦是人人熟悉的。漫画家库克里尼克斯、鲍里士·叶菲莫夫等人的漫画——这是用作反对我们的敌人——战争挑拨者及帝国主义反动派的代表——和暴露政治的最尖锐的材料。
    无疑的，漫画家干部是在各地方都有的。需要去找寻他们、吸引他们来参加报纸工作，同时要保证给与他们技术上的辅导和帮助。不应该忘记：为国际新闻创作漫画——是一件艰巨的任务，它只有在老练的漫画家和国际新闻记者与报纸领导者紧密联系的条件下才能实现。
    国内问题的漫画。每一幅国内问题的漫画应该是画得尖锐、技术高明，要从主题和对象的知识的观点出发，从艺术的观点出发。这里艺术家不应该对其所嘲笑的人物的缺点有露骨的讽刺和侮辱。否则漫画即丧失其目的。坏的漫画常需要一大篇文字和一长串的题词来补充说明，这样的漫画不能充分达到其揭露与讽刺的目的。
    地图。首先适合于国际述评，但亦可用作国内问题稿件的插图；特别是在最近，地图亦刊登在论文里，比如关于轮种的组织。这种地图给与一种在集体农庄田野上正确布置播种的概念，它是一种有巨大力量的文献，它能够把先进的，组织得很好的经营经验传达给落后者。
    表格和图解。在报纸上是作为经济问题论文的插图，作为更明确地说明某个生产地区状况的材料。作得简单明白的表格和图解能帮助读者更快、更深刻地分析清楚关于某一经济部门发展，关于这种发展趋向等的复杂材料。
    网状锌版印的标题画、装饰画和图案画。是用来强调各版的这一或那一文件材料，把它划成固定的一栏，使读者习惯于用每天重复的标题画找到报纸的专栏。这使读者能更快地在各版上找到他所需要的材料。在报纸上常常有这些栏的标题画，如“苏维埃国家概况”版，各栏的题目有：“新书”，“象棋”，“运动”等。
            ×          ×         ×
    如何来更好的组织报纸的版面呢？苏维埃报纸的实践在这方面积累了大量的经验。
    第一版通常都刊载党和政府领袖的像片，获得政府奖励的、在工作中都达到了卓越成就的苏维埃人民优秀代表的像片，还有各种大小庆祝会的照片等。第一版也登载说明播种期和收割期集体农庄田野上的劳动的大幅照片，新的工厂及车间的照片，或其他适合“苏维埃国家概况”一栏中某些论文和消息的插图材料。
    报纸的第二、三版的大部分是用于登载有关苏联国内生活问题的材料的。这里可以采用任何格式的插图，只要能够配合文件材料并补充它即可。带有简单说明题辞的插图亦可以有其独立的不与文件材料相关的主题。
    报纸第四版通常是用于登载国际材料，有时亦有论文及关于剧院、体育等的报道。这一版适宜登载国际问题的漫画以及体育、戏剧等照片。
    这里还应该注意一个小节，即关于各版铜图的编排。应该避免某一版的铜图的地位与报纸相应背页的铜图的地位“相合”，就是说，第一、二版或第三、四版相合。铜锌版位置相合，比如说，报纸第二版的铜锌版与第一版的像片或照片“相合”了，结果就会使像片或图画中的画面不清楚。
    这里要举出在报纸各版配置图片稿件的标准图式。但完全不应该从这里得出结论，说报纸都必须只遵守这种图式。每一个编辑部应该尽量寻找“自己的”编排特点，但这种特点不应该是在各版粗糙堆积图片的结果。问题不在于数量，而在于图片的质量及报纸上图片的适当的配置。某些编辑工作人员为了追求插图的数量及在各版开展大量的小小的铜锌版，而这些画常常很坏，有时完全为读者所不了解，这种作法是不对的。
    现在略谈一谈所谓专刊。这种专刊有着专门的性质，假若专刊的材料是一些专门准备的照片的话，那是最好不过的。为此而派遣摄影记者到创作这种基本文件材料的地方去，是适当的。这样的编排会更明朗更确信地强调出专刊的方向，提高对它的兴趣。
    报纸的专刊可以带有画的，锌版的标题画——“刊头”。
          ×            ×          ×
    报纸图片的表现性和明了性大都与铜锌版的质量有关。这个工作应当委托熟练的照片修饰家来担任。
    修饰家负有对照像（印成的照片和印样）“加工”的使命，以便制成铜锌版。修饰的使命在于强化照片同时并清除一些多余的零星东西，任何技术上的缺陷（斑点、擦纹），由于摄影记者的疏忽或不熟练（光线不对等）在画片上所现出的缺点。但修饰本身亦包含很多危险。技术不够的修饰有时不是改善了，而且是恶化甚至毁坏了照片。
    印在有光的（布纹的或非布纹的）纸上的照片，在修饰时所用的，最好要比给报纸制版用的放大一倍半。照片制成铜锌版和适当缩小时，很多修饰时不可免的“痕迹”都将消失，铜锌版亦会制得好些的。当制版的照片原图改铸铜锌版时，若不是缩小而是放大，“伸展”的话那就不好了。在这种场合，修饰的痕迹就很容易看得出来，制成铜锌版就显得粗糙而常常毁坏了画面。修饰家应该首先用墨笔或修刀（去掉白色的地方，用修刀把光线强的地方加深）来对照片“加工”。
    应该避免用铅粉，因为它们的特点是褪色，在一些不应有白点的地方造成白色的斑点。用铅粉时，假若又不可能使用修刀的话，修饰家应该特别小心，修理照片表面时要很精心，平稳，不要时轻时重。背光照的及因此灰暗的像片必须细心地用极细的铅粉薄层来“敷过”阴暗的地方。照片经过这样加工以后，制出的版就很光泽，亦适于印刷。
    报纸的编辑部应牢记这条规则：对待照片原图的每一个细小地方都必需达成高度的质量，在任何场合下都不应该希望修饰的错误“不会”在铅版上显现出来，或者希望它们会在制版时得到“改正”。在金属版上修正图像的缺点要比在照片原图上困难得多。因此在原图送去制版以前，编辑工作人员应该自己很细心地来检查修饰情况。
    报纸编辑部必须倾听制铜锌版时有关修版性质的一切愿望。制版所方面所提出的合法的技术上的要求应该即时予以满足。
    在本讲的范围内不可能将一切制版技术问题全部加以研究，我们只提几个对监督制版工作的有意义的问题。
    铜锌版制出后，制版所应向编辑部提交铜锌版印样。印样就是基本的检查凭证，编辑部根据这些清样评判铜锌版的质量。
    假若送交制版所的照片是清晰的，阴阳分明的，而铜锌版的清样却是单调而灰暗的话，那么这就证明：不是原图未被真实的制成铜锌版，就是铜锌版腐雕时没作好。这样的铜锌版，当然要立刻扔掉不用。有时腐雕不好的铜锌版还可以修改，但最好是重新作一次，这里很少侥幸。
    假若从正常的（阴影柔和）照片原图作出的铜锌版是黑白对比强烈的话——这就是说，照片制铜锌版时走了样子，没有正确对照。乍一看外表真确的印样，这种铜锌版在报纸上印出时就很坏，很“模糊”，必须重做。
    为了检查铜锌版印样，每一个编辑部应该有一个好的扩大镜。检查印样——这不仅是要检查它们与原图是否相似，而且要细心地审查，铜锌版上有没有什么擦纹和缺陷等。
    编辑部应该为在本报工作的摄影记者创造技术基础。要摄影记者自己来修饰底片或在家庭的半手工业式的条件下印刷是不容许的。
    报纸的编辑部应该有一个虽然不大但有必要的材料、器具等的摄影实验室。能够帮助编辑部摄影工作的好的资料——是米库林著的摄影手册《现代摄影术》。其中引用了很多关于材料消耗的标准和摄影工作必备的化学药品的有益的知识。
    摄影记者必须将报纸所委托拍照的底片交给编辑部，交给特设的像片保管处，这些材料在那里将按照为此目的所规定的国家规则被保管着。当然也不需把所有的底片都保存在保管处，这也没有被什么规则规定。编辑部应该选择那些能够在报纸上刊用或将来会有价值的底片。
    对摄影记者，一如对创作家一样，著作权的法令是适用的，编辑部必须确切遵守这项法令。但没有编辑部的同意任何一个摄影记者都不得处理底片。
                ×               ×              ×
    关于报纸编辑部在检查图片工作中的基本任务，我们已简略的作了一般的叙述了。
    读者有权要求每一张报纸的外观很好，要求鲜明的图片来补充文件材料，要求报纸上所登载的图片是有充分价值的，而且不能将图片问题，报纸编排问题看作什么次要的、纯技术的问题。必须常常记住：图片，它和报纸上的任何稿件一样，能帮助我们的报刊完成它作为战斗的布尔什维克宣传者、鼓动者和组织者的任务。    （续完）  （伊南译）
