　　Suburban Beijing Peasants Warmly Welcome Livestock Insurance
    Over 700 Head of Livestock Insured in Three Months
    Insurance Company Effectively Handles Claims, Gaining Farmers' Trust.
    [Our Dispatch] The People's Insurance Company of China began piloting livestock insurance in key areas of suburban Beijing in June this year, which has been well received by farmers. In the past three months, over 700 head of livestock have been insured. Due to the company's prompt handling of insurance claims, farmers have increasingly trusted this insurance business. The Wulidian Administrative Village in the 12th District is one of the key pilot areas. The village has more than 40 head of draught animals, of which 30 have been insured. The company's handling of this insurance business has received close cooperation from the suburban work committee, district and village governments, and the Agricultural University. All insured livestock have undergone inspection and vaccinations. If livestock become ill, the company is responsible for treatment. Therefore, farmers have warmly welcomed livestock insurance. Initially, farmers were somewhat skeptical about claims due to a lack of experience. They generally believed that the insurance premiums paid for a head of livestock were limited (the insurance premium for mules and donkeys is only 3% of the insured amount per year), while the disease prevention and medical care provided were already substantial. Therefore, they did not believe that the insurance company would compensate them if something happened to the livestock. On the evening of September 16, a mule belonging to farmer Zhu Liande in the village died of acute enteritis. On the 17th, the insurance company immediately sent personnel to properly dispose of the dead animal. On the 18th, compensation was paid in full according to the insured amount. When the livestock first died, the owner's whole family wept. The insurance procedure for this livestock had only been completed four days prior, and the insurance policy had not yet been received. The livestock owner felt that if the insurance company did not acknowledge the claim, he would have no recourse. Unexpectedly, at a village cadre meeting convened on the 18th, the insurance company paid the full compensation of over one million yuan on the spot, based on the insured amount of Zhu Liande's livestock. At this point, everyone's doubts were completely dispelled. Zhu Liande said happily: "I never dreamed that the compensation would be paid so quickly! I thought that even if there was compensation, it would be discounted by 20 or 30 percent, and there wouldn't be much left for me. I didn't expect it to be paid in full without any deductions. The current government says what it means, and it's always thinking of us and taking care of the people so considerately. In the past, the reactionary government would only deceive the people, but now it's completely different."
    At that time, it was the season of autumn harvest and autumn planting. After receiving the compensation, Zhu Liande immediately went to the market to buy a donkey, and his production was not affected. Two days before this incident, a donkey belonging to Chen Tongqing in the same village died after falling while pulling a cart. Because it was not insured, he did not receive any compensation. He regretted not having taken out insurance sooner. From the above two facts, the peasants in the suburbs of Beijing have deeply realized the importance of insurance. The promptness and reliability of the People's Insurance Company of China in handling claims has also greatly encouraged the farmers' enthusiasm for production, and created favorable conditions for the future promotion of agricultural insurance.

　　京郊农民热烈欢迎牲畜保险
    三个月承保牲口七百余头
    保险公司切实处理赔款事件，此项业务得到农民信任。
    【本报讯】中国人民保险公司今年六月间在京郊重点试办牲畜保险，很受农民欢迎。三个多月来，已承保牲口七百多头。由于该公司迅速处理保险赔款，农民对此项保险业务益加信任。第十二区五里店行政村为重点试办区域之一，全村有力畜四十多头，已保险的有三十头。该公司办理此项保险业务，得到了郊区工作委员会及区村政府和农业大学的密切合作，对承保的牲畜都经过检验和防疫注射。牲畜有了病，该公司负责治疗。因此，农民对于牲畜保险很表欢迎。最初农民由于没有经验，对于赔款还有些怀疑，总以为一头牲口所缴的保险费有限（骡、驴保险费仅按保额每年收百分之三），而防疫和医药的照顾已经很多了。因此，都不大相信牲畜出了事，保险公司还会赔偿。九月十六日晚上，该村农民朱连德的骡子患急性肠炎死了。十七日，保险公司即派员把死畜处理好。十八日，即照保额十足偿付赔款。牲口初死时，畜主全家哭泣。这头牲口办好投保手续只有四天，保险单还没有拿到，手里一点凭据也没有，畜主觉得如果保险公司不承认赔偿，自己没有什么办法。事出意外，在十八日临时召集的村干部会议上，保险公司根据朱连德的牲口保额，当场付足一百余万元赔款。至此，大家疑虑完全消除。朱连德欣喜地说：“真做梦也想不到，赔咱钱有这样快！我想就是赔钱也是七折八扣的，到我这里也就没有什么钱了，想不到一点也不折，十足赔偿。现在的政府说什么是什么，处处都为我们着想，照顾老百姓太周到了。过去反动政府只会欺骗老百姓，现在真是完全不同了。”
    当时，正是秋收秋种的时候，朱连德领得赔款后，马上到市场买回一头驴，他的生产未受影响。在这件事情发生的前两天，同村有陈同庆的一条驴，在拖车时摔死了，因未保险，得不到补偿，他很懊悔当初对保险不应该犹豫。从以上两件事实中，京郊农民已深切地体会到保险的重要；中国人民保险公司处理赔款的迅速和确实，也大大鼓励了农民的生产热情，并对今后推行农业保险创造了有利条件。
