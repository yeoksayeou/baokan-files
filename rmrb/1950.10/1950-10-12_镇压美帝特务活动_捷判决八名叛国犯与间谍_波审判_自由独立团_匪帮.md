　　Suppressing American Imperialist Espionage Activities

    Czechoslovakia Sentences Eight Traitors and Spies
    Poland Tries "Freedom and Independence" Gang of Bandits
    [Xinhua News Agency, November 11th dispatch] A comprehensive TASS dispatch from Prague: The Brno State Court of Czechoslovakia publicly tried eight traitors and spies, including Gaek, on the 5th. The trial confirmed that the defendant Gaek was in contact with Gates, the British Vice-Consul in Bratislava, and American special agent Fisher, accepting a radio station supplied by Gates and sending intelligence on the political and economic aspects of Czechoslovakia to foreign countries in code. The defendants also hid weapons, plotting to organize armed rebellion when Western imperialist countries attacked Czechoslovakia.
    The defendants all confessed to their crimes. On the 7th, the court sentenced Gaek to life imprisonment, fined him 100,000 Czech crowns (Czech currency), and sentenced the other defendants to varying terms of imprisonment, fines, and deprivation of civil rights.
    [Xinhua News Agency dispatch] TASS, Moscow, 9th: *Pravda* today published a Warsaw dispatch by Makarenko entitled "American Spies Tried by People's Court." Makarenko wrote: The Warsaw Military Court has begun the trial of the leaders of a reactionary illegal group disguised under the name "Freedom and Independence" – a gang of spies and murderers. This foreign espionage organization was extremely active in Poland from 1944 to 1947.
    The indictment and the defendants' confessions revealed the criminal activities of "Freedom and Independence." The task of this group was to restore the landlord-capitalist regime hated by the people, suppress all revolutionary forces, undermine the Polish workers' parties, and place the country under the control of American and British imperialism.
    This reactionary illegal group did not hesitate to use all means to achieve its goals of harming the country. Hooligan-style attacks on Workers' Party leaders, people's activists, and representatives of progressive intellectuals, robbing urban and rural people, and carrying out provocative propaganda were all means they adopted on the orders of the bankrupt government-in-exile in London, which was employed by American and British imperialists. "Freedom and Independence" became an espionage center for the American spy agency in Poland, which was clearly agreed upon by the London "Polish government." Now, this group of professional habitual bandits and spies is being tried by the military court; they are: Zieplinski, a senior officer of the Krakow military region of the Sassov province, who later became the head of the "Freedom and Independence" headquarters, the espionage leader Kowalec, the political advisor Hemel, and the headquarters staff: Lazarowicz, Kubik, Bralsej, Sepka, and Batore. They committed dozens of assassinations, barbaric atrocities, and robberies. They sold documents relating to state and military secrets to American spies.
    The leaders of the "Freedom and Independence" headquarters established direct contact with American spies as early as the beginning of 1945.
    The defendants maintained regular and close contact with officials of the American Embassy in Warsaw: Colonel Washley, Lieutenant Colonel York, and Colonel Jeser.
    The activities of the Polish "Freedom and Independence," this reactionary illegal group, were completely directed by its masters in Washington, employed by Washington, and received allowances from them.
    American spies, disguised as diplomatic officials, gave this illegal group hope that a war against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries was about to break out.
    This trial clearly and convincingly shows that not only were the participants in the "Freedom and Independence" criminal gang serving the American spy agency, but so were Mikolajczyk and the leading organs of his party, as well as the upper-level reactionary leaders of the Polish Catholic Church.
    Information about state secrets was passed to American intelligence agencies through many other relationships. They particularly took advantage of the American Embassy in Warsaw's reception of the leaders of "Freedom and Independence" to achieve this goal.
    Makarenko concluded by writing that the masks on the faces of American spies have been torn off. This trial convincingly proves that "Freedom and Independence" is an espionage and subversive illegal group directly controlled by American spies.

　　镇压美帝特务活动
    捷判决八名叛国犯与间谍
    波审判“自由独立团”匪帮
    【新华社十一日讯】综合塔斯社布拉格消息：捷克斯洛伐克布尔诺州国家法庭，于五日公开审讯了加埃克等八名叛国犯与间谍。审讯证实：被告加埃克和英国驻布拉的斯拉发副领事盖兹及美国特务费希尔有联系，接受盖兹供给的无线电台，用密码向外国发送有关捷国政治和经济方面的情报。被告等并私藏武器，图谋在西方帝国主义国家进攻捷克斯洛伐克时，组织武装叛乱。
    被告等对所犯罪行均已服罪。法庭于七日判处加埃克无期徒刑，罚款十万克朗（捷币），判处其他被告以刑期不等的有期徒刑，分别科以罚金并褫夺公权。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科九日电：真理报今天刊载马卡伦科所撰《美国奸细受人民法庭审判”的华沙通讯。马卡伦科写道：华沙军事法庭已开始审讯一个以“自由独立团”的名义伪装的反动非法团体——间谍与杀人犯伙帮——的领袖们。这个外国间谍组织在一九四四年到一九四七年间在波兰极为活跃。
    起诉书与被告的供词表明了“自由独立团”的犯罪活动。这个团体的任务是要恢复人民所痛恨的地主资本家政权，压制一切革命力量，破坏波兰的工人政党，将国家置于美英帝国主义的掌握中。
    这个反动的非法团体不惜用一切手段来达到它的危害国家的目的。对工人党领袖、人民积极分子和进步知识分子的代表进行流氓式的攻击，抢劫城市与乡村人民，进行挑拨性的宣传——这些都是他们奉了设在伦敦的破产了的流亡政府的命令而采用的手段，而伦敦流亡政府却是受美英帝国主义者佣用的。“自由独立团”成为美国间谍机关在波兰的间谍中心，这一点显然是得到伦敦“波兰政府”的同意的。现在，这一批职业的惯匪与间谍受到军事法庭的审判了；他们便是：撒索夫省克拉约瓦军的高级军官，后来成为“自由独立团”总部首脑的捷普林斯基、间谍首领科瓦列茨、政治顾问赫美尔，以及总部的人员：拉查罗维兹、库比克、布拉尔塞伊、塞普卡及巴托雷等人。他们犯过数十次的暗杀、野蛮暴行和抢劫罪行。他们把有关国家与军事秘密的文件出卖给美国的间谍。
    “自由独立团”总部的领袖们早在一九四五年初就跟美国的间谍建立了直接联系。
    被告等长期与美国驻华沙大使馆的官员——瓦什莱上校、约克中校、杰赛上校等人保持经常的密切联系。
    波兰“自由独立团”，这个反动非法团体的活动完全受其华盛顿主人的指挥，受华盛顿的雇用并从他们那里领取津贴。
    美国间谍伪装为外交官员，使这个非法团体抱着一种希望，以为进攻苏联和人民民主国家的战争马上就要爆发了。
    这一次的审判清楚地而且令人信服地表明，替美国间谍机关服务的不仅是“自由独立团”犯罪伙帮的参与者，而且还有米柯拉兹科及其政党的领导机关，以及波兰天主教的上层反动领袖们。
    有关国家机密的情报被通过许多别的关系传递给美国的特务机关。他们特别利用美国驻华沙大使馆接待“自由独立团”领袖们的机会来达到这个目的。
    马卡伦科最后写道，美国奸细脸上的假面具已被撕下来了。这次的审判令人信服地证明，“自由独立团”是一个直接受美国间谍指挥的间谍与颠覆性的非法团体。
