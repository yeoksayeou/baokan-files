　　Friendship Between Chinese and Bulgarian Workers
    Letter from Bulgarian Paint Workers to Workers of Shanghai Wanli Paint Factory

    Editor's Note: In June of this year, workers, technicians, and engineers from the Shanghai Wanli Paint Factory used Esperanto through the Shanghai Esperanto Association to communicate collectively with foreign workers. The following letter is a reply from a paint factory in Bulgaria. Bulgarian workers published the Shanghai workers' letter in the trade union's official newspaper. Through mutual understanding, the workers of the two countries have further strengthened the solidarity and friendship of the international working class.

    To the Workers, Technicians, and Engineers of Shanghai Wanli Paint Factory:

    We are very pleased to receive your letter expressing your willingness to contact us.

    We know very well about your heroic struggle to liberate yourselves from the exploitation and oppression of the Anglo-American imperialists and their lackeys. Now you have won, because truth is on your side, and even more because many outstanding heroes have emerged from your glorious working class, like your Communist leader Comrade Mao Zedong. Now, when the greedy Anglo-American imperialists are interfering in the internal affairs of your democratic and freedom-loving neighbor—the heroic Korean people—thereby inciting a new world war, we are sure that the world proletariat, under the leadership of the brilliant socialist country, the Soviet Union, and the genius Stalin, will never allow the working people to become slaves again.

    Five years ago, the workers in our country, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party and its immortal educator and leader, the prestigious proletarian worker in the international workers' movement, Georgi Dimitrov, and with the assistance of the invincible Soviet army, destroyed the hateful fascist rule that had been fattened for years by the blood and sweat of the workers.

    Since then, an unparalleled construction boom has begun in our country. Because, as our beloved teacher Comrade Georgi Dimitrov said, "We must do in ten years what others have done in a hundred years." As a result of the Bulgarian working class's high level of enthusiasm, our small country has fundamentally changed. Many new factories of all sizes have appeared in our country, labor productivity has repeatedly increased, and new forms and methods have been adopted in our work. All this has enabled us to fully recover from the wounds suffered by our country in the Second World War in a short period of time and to overcome the economic poverty we have experienced for decades. This is no accident. We have been able to achieve this by relying on the great assistance of the Soviet Union and the mutual assistance of the people's democratic countries, while learning from the inexhaustible experience of the Soviet people. We have created new people from the ranks of the people. Our political, economic, and cultural life is led by the sons of the people. Our people's authorities and the Communist Party use all kinds of forces and methods to create new types of people: allowing the children of workers to study in universities, technical schools, and middle schools. Comrade Valko Chervenkov, a faithful student of Georgi Dimitrov, the Prime Minister of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the General Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party, has greatly opened the doors of schools to talented men and women workers. It can be guaranteed that our enterprises will soon be led by intellectuals from our own people's ranks.

    We are confident and insistent on building socialism in our country. We have completed the two-year economic plan and are now implementing a five-year plan to build the country's economy in order to lay a solid foundation for socialism. We are carrying out construction with joy and encouragement, because everyone knows that we are building our own happy future. Our people's authorities are constantly increasing their concern for the life and culture of the workers, and everyone is guaranteed the right to work and the right to rest. Now, in our country, workers have the most beautiful villas as places of rest. Those places, not long ago, were still places of revelry for the former reactionary business owners.

    We work eight hours a day, and the rest of the time is used for political theory and cultural studies. Every enterprise has libraries and reading rooms set up for this purpose, equipped with the necessary books, magazines, and newspapers. In addition, there are sports fields and squares for young people to exercise, and in larger enterprises, there are even amateur theatrical activities for workers' groups, etc. For the professional education of workers, technical workshops are opened every year in various enterprises, and every worker participates in classes. Therefore, a movement of rationalization and invention of great significance has arisen in our country, which has improved technology and saved the country millions of Bulgarian currency in expenses. The country can also use this money for new construction and to improve the living standards of workers.

    Dear Comrades, although we are thousands of kilometers apart, we always regard you as our own brothers. We express our brotherly concern for your just struggle for national liberation, especially now, when the American imperialists are occupying Taiwan in an attempt to obstruct the overall unification of the Chinese people. We express our love for the entire Chinese people. We firmly believe that you will win. The world-famous heroic and invincible Chinese people, with the invincible Soviet Union and hundreds of millions of people around the world with you, are all guarantees of your victory.

    We believe that this first exchange of letters between you and our factory is a sign of the eternal friendship between the workers of China and our beautiful little country. Through it, let us, the workers of these two countries, which are far apart but have the same strong confidence in our beautiful socialist future, shake hands tightly with each other.

                                        Fourteen Bulgarian Workers (signed)

　　中保两国工人的友情
    保国油漆工人给上海万里漆厂工人的信
    编者按：今年六月间，上海万里造漆厂的工人、技师和工程师，通过上海世界语协会利用世界语和国外工人集体通信。下面的一封信是保加利亚一个造漆厂写来的回信。保加利亚的工人曾将上海工人的去信刊登在职工总会的机关报上。两国工人经过相互的了解，进一步加强了国际工人阶级的团结与友爱。
    上海万里造漆厂工人、技师和工程师们：
    收到你们表示愿意和我们取得联系的来信，我们非常高兴。
    对于你们从英美帝国主义者及其走狗们的剥削压迫之下，求得自己的解放，而作的英勇的斗争，我们是很知道的。现在你们胜利了，因为真理是在你们一方面，而且更因为从你们光荣的工人阶级里，涌现了许多出色的英雄。像你们的共产党领袖毛泽东同志。现在当贪婪的英美帝国主义者对你们的民主和爱好自由的邻邦——英勇的朝鲜人民的内部事务横加干涉，从而掀起新的世界战争的时候。我们确信全世界无产阶级，在光辉的社会主义国家苏联和天才的斯大林领导下，决不再允许劳动者重新成为奴隶。
    五年前，我们国内的劳动者在保加利亚共产党和它不朽的教育者和领导者，在国际工人运动中负有声望的无产阶级工作者乔治·季米特洛夫的领导和无敌的苏维埃军队的援助之下，摧毁了多年来用劳动者血汗养胖了的，叫人深恶痛绝的法西斯的统治。
    从那时候起，在我们的国家里，开始了无比的建设热潮。因为，正如我们敬爱的导师乔治·季特米洛夫同志所说的“我们必须在十年之内做完人家一百年的工作”。由于我们保加利亚工人阶级发挥高度工作热忱的结果，我们这个小国家已经基本地改变了。我们国家里出现了许多新的大小工厂，劳动生产一再增加，在工作中都采用了新的形式和方法。这一切使得我们能够在短期内使我们国家在第二次世界大战中所受的创伤完全复原，并且战胜了几十年来所经历的经济的贫困。这不是偶然的事。我们是凭借着苏联的伟大援助和人民民主国家的互助，同时学习着苏联人民汲取不尽的经验才能达到的。我们创造了出身于人民阶层的新人物。我们的政治、经济和文化生活是由人民的儿子来领导的。我们的人民当局和共产党用尽各种力量和方法来创造新型人物：让工人子女在大学、技术学校和中学校里读书。乔治·季米特洛夫同志的忠实学生、保加利亚人民共和国总理、保加利亚共产党总书记凡尔科·契尔文科夫同志给有才能的男女工人大大地打开了学校的大门。可以这样保证，我们的企业不久将由来自我们人民自己的行列中的知识分子来领导了。
    我们有把握而且坚持在我们的国内建设社会主义。我们已经完成了两年经济计划，现在正在实行建设国家经济的五年计划，来奠定社会主义的稳固基础。我们满怀欢欣和鼓舞来进行建设，因为大家知道，我们是在建设自己的幸福的将来。我们的人民当局不断地增加对于工人的生活和文化的关心，每个人都被保证有工作的权利和休息的权利。现在在我们国家里，劳动者有最美丽的别墅作为休息的场所。就是那些地方，在不久之前，还是从前反动的企业主们作为狂欢的地方的。
    我们每天工作八小时，其余的时间用来作政治理论和文化学习。每一个企业中都有为这个目的而设立的图书馆和阅览室，备有必需的图书和杂志报纸。此外还有青年们锻炼体格的运动场和广场，在较大的企业里，更有工人团体的业余剧艺活动等等。为了工人的职业教育，各企业每年都开办有技术讲习班，每个工人都参加上课。因此在我们国内兴起了有重要意义的合理化和发明的运动，使技术赖以改进，并替国家节省千百万保币的开支。国家也就可以用这些钱从事于新的建设和改善劳动者的生活水平。
    亲爱的同志们，虽然我们相隔数千公里，但我们终是把你们当亲兄弟一样看待。对于你们为国家的解放而作的正义斗争，特别是现在，当美帝国主义者侵占台湾以图阻碍中国人民全面统一的时候，我们向你们表示我们兄弟的关怀。我们向你们表示对全中国人民的敬爱。我们坚决相信，你们必将胜利。闻名世界的英勇无敌的中国人民，有无敌的苏联和全世界亿万人民跟你们在一起，这都是你们胜利的保证。
    我们认为你们和我们工厂间的第一封交换的信是中国和我们美丽的小国家的工人间永恒友爱的标志。通过它，让我们这两个相隔遥远而对于我们社会主义美好的将来具有同样坚强的信心的国家的工人，相互紧紧握起手来吧。
                                        保加利亚工人十四人签名
