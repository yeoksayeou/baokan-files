One hundred and fifty-nine representatives from various ethnic groups from Inner Mongolia, Northwest, Southwest, Central South, East China, Northeast, and directly-administered provinces and municipalities, before their departure, wrote a letter to express their respect to Chairman Mao, the great leader and teacher of all ethnic groups in China. In addition, they also sent a letter to the people of the capital to express their gratitude.

Xinhua News Agency, October 28th: Before leaving Beijing, the delegations of various regions and ethnic groups who came to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations jointly wrote to Chairman Mao to express their respect. The original letter is as follows: Dear Chairman Mao:

This time we came to the capital, we received generous treatment from the Central People's Government and a warm welcome from the people of the capital. Over the past month, we have seen the new vitality of our country, and we have seen the efforts made by our country in political, military, economic, and cultural fields to represent the common interests of the people of all ethnic groups in China and the great achievements it has already achieved. What is particularly important is that in every matter and on every occasion, we have deeply experienced that in the People's Republic of China, our various ethnic groups have been equal and have been closely united on the basis of equality. All this has made us feel extremely excited, filled us with confidence in the development of the People's Republic of China, and given us not only infinite hope but also full confidence that our minority ethnic people will be liberated from poverty and backwardness and achieve prosperity and progress. We fully know that without your great and wise leadership, all this would not be possible. Therefore, in our excitement, we have a deep sense of gratitude for you, the dear Chairman Mao who led our people of all ethnic groups to achieve liberation and will lead us to greater victory.

Now we are about to leave the capital and return to our own ethnic groups. When we return to our own ethnic groups, we must convey the deep concern of the Central People's Government and you to all the people of our ethnic group, and we must also tell every one of our ethnic group about the serious threat posed to our country by the US imperialism and the remaining domestic counter-revolutionaries. In order to combat any aggressive attempts by imperialism and eliminate the remaining forces of domestic counter-revolution, and for the great construction cause of our country, we must always practice your call under your banner: "People of all ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China unite!" and march towards the victorious and bright great future.

With best regards,

Northwest Region Ethnic Delegation
