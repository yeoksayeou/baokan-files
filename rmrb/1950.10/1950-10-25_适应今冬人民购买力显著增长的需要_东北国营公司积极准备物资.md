Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 21st – The autumn harvest in the Northeast region is nearing completion, and the peak season for trade between urban and rural areas has begun. State-owned trading departments have prepared a huge amount of winter supplies to meet the needs of the people's significantly increased purchasing power. As of the end of September, the Northeast China National Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company had prepared 1.9 million bolts of cloth and 1,200 tons of cotton for padding (used for padded clothes and quilts). It is estimated that by the end of the fourth quarter, 3.8 million bolts of cloth and 7,400 tons of cotton for padding will be prepared, which will basically meet the needs of the people this winter. In order to prepare "wula" shoes (traditional winter shoes made of animal hide) for farmers, the Northeast China General Merchandise Company has purchased a huge amount of cattle hides from various places. "Wula" shoes are being processed in Heilongjiang, Songjiang, Jilin and other places, and it is estimated that the manufacturing plan will be fully completed in early November. In addition, the General Merchandise Company ordered one million pairs of rubber-soled cotton shoes and 700,000 grain sacks from the Ministry of Industry. Leather coats, leather hats, felt shoes, fur raw materials, and window paper for rural use, which were prepared by the provincial general merchandise companies themselves, have also been mostly purchased. In addition to the supplies allocated by the regional company, the Liaoxi Provincial General Merchandise Company had completed 84.4 percent of its plan by the end of September.

Due to this year's bumper harvest in the Northeast region, the purchasing power of farmers has increased, and the task of urban-rural exchange is more arduous than in previous years. Therefore, the Northeast trading departments began preparing winter supplies as early as July, and the quantity of various supplies greatly exceeded those of previous years. The general merchandise prepared by the Northeast China General Merchandise Company system is twice that of the same period last year; the cotton cloth and padding prepared by the Northeast China National Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company have also increased by one time compared with last year. At the same time, state-owned trading companies have played an active role in various economies in the preparation work and solved the difficulties in the source of materials. In addition to the 47.6 percent of leather coats provided by public enterprises, the Liaoxi Provincial General Merchandise Company purchased 49 percent from private enterprises; cotton and leather shoes are all processed by the Siping Cooperative General Office. In Heilongjiang Province, where the public leather industry lacks equipment, about 90 percent of the "wula" shoes are processed by private leather industries in various counties.

　　适应今冬人民购买力显著增长的需要
    东北国营公司积极准备物资
    【新华社沈阳二十一日电】东北地区秋收即将结束，城乡贸易的旺季已经开始。国营贸易部门为供应购买力显著增长的人民需要，已经准备了巨量冬季需用物资。截至九月底止，东北区花纱布公司已准备了一百九十万匹布、一千二百吨装花（铺装棉衣和棉被所用棉花），预定到第四季度末，将可备妥三百八十万匹布，七千四百吨装花，基本上将可满足今冬人民的要求。东北区百货公司为了准备农民用的靰鞡鞋，已由各地购到巨量牛皮。黑龙江、松江、吉林等地靰鞡，正在进行加工，估计十一月初可全部完成制造计划。另外，百货公司向工业部订购了胶棉鞋一百万双，装粮用的麻袋七十万条。由各省百货公司自行准备的皮大衣，皮帽子，毡鞋，毛皮原料，农村用的窗户纸等也都大部采购齐备。辽西省百货公司，除由区公司分拨的物资外，在九月底前已完成了计划的百分之八十四点四。
    东北地区由于今年丰收，农民购买力提高，城乡交流的任务比往年繁重，因此东北贸易部门早在七月间即开始准备冬用物资，各种物资的数量均大大超过往年。由东北区百货公司系统所准备的百货，超过去年同时期的两倍；由东北区花纱布公司所准备的棉布和装花也比去年增多一倍。同时，国营贸易公司在准备工作中发挥了各种经济的积极作用，解决了物资来源的困难。辽西省百货公司的皮大衣，除公营企业供给百分之四十七点六外，向私营企业采购的占百分之四十九；棉、皮鞋则全部由四平合作总社加工。公营皮革业设备不足的黑龙江省，百分之九十左右的靰鞡系组织各县私营皮革业加工。
