　　Industrial Model Workers Zhao Guoyou and Nie Bingju
    Oppose US Imperialism's Expansion of the War of Aggression
    On the 13th and 14th of this month, invading American imperialist planes intruded into our Northeast airspace several times, indiscriminately bombing our peaceful residents. This new provocative act demonstrates that US imperialism is deliberately expanding its war of aggression. US imperialism attempts to expand the war of aggression in Korea to various Asian countries, attempting to spread the flames of aggression to the bodies of our people. Our Foreign Minister Zhou and the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have repeatedly stated: The Chinese people love peace, but in order to defend peace, we have never been afraid of resisting wars of aggression. We cannot tolerate such aggressive crimes by US imperialism! We resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and protest with practical actions. We must be highly vigilant, and we are fully prepared at all times to smash any aggressive provocations by US imperialism. All our factory employees and their families are tensely mobilizing to do a good job in all aspects of defense, anti-espionage, and other production protection work. All our factory workers unanimously guarantee: We will persist in production under any circumstances. We guarantee to complete production tasks ahead of schedule, reduce consumption, and create new records, using the practical actions of production competition to resist the expanded war of aggression by US imperialism!

　　工业劳模赵国有聂秉举
    反对美帝扩大侵略战争
    本月十三、十四两日侵朝美帝飞机数次侵入我东北领空，滥炸我和平居民。这新的挑衅行为，说明了美帝是蓄意扩大侵略战争。美帝企图把侵朝战争扩大到亚洲各国，企图把侵略战火烧到我国人民的身上来。我国周外长和外交部发言人一再声明：中国人民热爱和平，但是为了保卫和平，我们是从来不怕反抗侵略战争的，我们不能容忍美帝这种侵略罪行！我们坚决用实际行动拥护周外长的声明和抗议。我们一定高度警惕起来，我们时刻都做充分准备，以粉碎美帝的任何侵略挑衅。我们全厂职工和家属正紧张动员起来，做好一切防空、防特等保卫生产工作。我们全厂工友一致保证：在任何情况下都坚持生产。我们保证要提前完成生产任务，减少消耗，创造新纪录，以生产竞赛的实际行动，抵抗美帝国主义的扩大侵略战争！
