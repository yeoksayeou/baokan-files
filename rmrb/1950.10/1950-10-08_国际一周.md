    The Korean People Firmly Resist the American Aggressors

    For more than three months, the American aggressors have directed their running dog, the Syngman Rhee puppet clique in South Korea, to launch an adventurous offensive, and then openly carried out a war of aggression against Korea. In the first two months of the war, the American aggressors underestimated the strength of the Korean people and suffered heavy blows from the Korean People's Army, being compressed by the People's Army onto a small piece of land on the southeastern coast of Korea, facing the fate of being driven into the sea. In an attempt to save themselves from destruction and achieve their goal of invading all of Korea, the American aggressors placed a bigger bet on the Korean battlefield on September 15, mobilizing all the naval, land, and air forces they could currently use in the Far East, and piecing together the ships and forces of seven vassal states, the Syngman Rhee puppet clique, and Japanese fascists, landing at Inchon and occupying Seoul on September 30 after paying a heavy price of 14,000 casualties. Currently, the Korean People's Army is resolutely resisting the enemy forces attempting to continue their northward advance; at the same time, in order to adapt to the new changes in the war situation, the Korean People's Army has voluntarily withdrawn from the south in order to concentrate its forces and more effectively strike at the invaders.

    The intensified military adventure of the American aggressors against Korea has undoubtedly brought new difficulties to the cause of liberation of the Korean people, but the American aggressors' dream of conquering the Korean people is doomed to failure, and the Korean people will win the final victory of the liberation struggle in a protracted war of resistance. After the American aggressors have carried out the adventure of further expanding the war of aggression, they will not only suffer more opposition from the people of the world and become more politically isolated, but also fall into a very unfavorable position militarily. First of all, the adventurous in-depth advance of the American aggressor forces has lengthened their front lines and dispersed their forces. After liberation, land reform has been carried out in the vast areas of South Korea, and new people's governments at all levels have been established. The people's level of awareness and organization has been improved and strengthened. The American aggressors are advancing alone, occupying some points and lines, which will inevitably aggravate their own crisis. An Associated Press reporter had to admit: "The Communist troops are the most dangerous and determined enemy. They have small units distributed everywhere and behind the American army... The small red dots representing enemy guerrillas on the intelligence maps are scattered throughout South Korea... The Korean War is far from over." Secondly, the American aggressor forces are fighting on the territory of other countries far across the ocean, too far away from the rear, and military supplies are extremely difficult. As the war drags on, the consumption is huge, the difficulties will increase day by day, and the weaknesses will be more exposed. Again, the American army has no just cause and low morale, coupled with the corruption and fear of death of the American army, so the combat effectiveness is very weak, and as the war prolongs, the weaknesses in this area will become more obvious.

    Therefore, no matter what hardships and difficulties the Korean people may experience, under the policy of protracted resistance and with the support of the people of the world, they will surely overcome all obstacles and achieve final victory.

    The Struggle Between Two Lines at the United Nations General Assembly

    The Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly opened in New York on September 19. This session is being held under the circumstances that American imperialism has launched a war of aggression in Korea and is trying to expand the war of aggression. Therefore, the struggle to defend peace at the United Nations General Assembly is the current urgent task of the people of the world. As the leader of the peace and democracy camp, the Soviet delegation first proposed at the opening meeting of the General Assembly to expel the representatives of the Kuomintang and invite representatives of the Central People's Government to attend the General Assembly in order to protect the legitimacy of the United Nations. And at the general debate that began on September 20, the Soviet representative Vyshinsky also proposed the "Declaration on Preventing the Threat of a New War and Consolidating World Peace and Security," requesting the General Assembly to explicitly declare: (1) condemn the propaganda of a new war; (2) unconditionally prohibit atomic weapons and regard any government that first uses such weapons of mass murder as a war criminal; (3) the five major powers of the United States, Britain, France, China, and the Soviet Union conclude a treaty on consolidating peace, and first each immediately reduce armaments by one-third, in order to ensure the realization of peace and security. After the Political Committee of the General Assembly began to consider the Korean issue, in order to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, the Soviet Union, together with Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, proposed a joint proposal requesting an immediate ceasefire between the warring parties in Korea, an immediate withdrawal of foreign troops, and free elections by all Korean people to establish a unified and independent national government.

    All these actions of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, as Pravda pointed out, clearly point out the correct path to peace and express the will of the entire progressive mankind to defend peace.

    Completely contrary to this is the action of American imperialism. It first manipulated the majority at the opening meeting of the General Assembly to veto the Soviet proposal to expel the representatives of the Kuomintang and invite the representatives of the Central People's Government, deliberately placing the United Nations in an illegal state. And at the plenary meeting on September 20, the U.S. Secretary of State Acheson proposed a four-point plan to change the UN Charter and undermine the UN organization, thereby destroying the main body of the UN - the Security Council based on the principle of great power consensus - and replacing it with the UN General Assembly under U.S. majority control, so that the United States could turn the UN completely into a fig leaf for further aggression. On September 30, at the Political Committee of the General Assembly, the United States instigated eight vassal states, including Britain and Australia, to propose that the United Nations establish a committee to establish a national government of Korea for "independence and unification" in consultation with MacArthur's so-called "United Nations Unified Command," in order to find an excuse for the United States to further occupy Korea.

    So far, the United Nations General Assembly is engaged in a fierce struggle around the above-mentioned motion. The attitude of the United States in this struggle clearly shows that the purpose of the United States is to completely turn the United Nations into a tool for aggression, in order to facilitate its expansion of war, while the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries represent the will of the peace-loving people of the world and are determined to thwart the conspiracy of the United States, to defend the United Nations and to defend world peace. Although the United States controls the voting machine of the majority of the General Assembly, it has increasingly exposed its aggressive face in front of the people of the world and is increasingly isolated, while the proposals of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries have won the heartfelt support of democratic public opinion around the world.

    Simultaneously with the United Nations General Assembly, the Security Council is continuing to conduct a hearing on the case of accusing the United States of armed aggression against Taiwan. Although the United States has repeatedly obstructed it in various ways since the end of August, under the insistence of the Soviet representative, the Security Council had to pass a proposal at the meeting on September 29, inviting representatives of our People's Republic of China to participate in the meeting of the Security Council after November 15 to discuss our country's accusation against the United States' aggression against Taiwan. Our people resolutely oppose the United States' aggression against our territory of Taiwan and the violation of our airspace, bombing and strafing our people, and insist that the United Nations sanction the American aggressors and order the American aggressor forces to withdraw from Taiwan and Korea.

    The Great Peaceful Construction of the Soviet Union

    On the eve of the successful completion of the Soviet Union's post-war five-year economic plan, the Soviet Council of Ministers successively issued decisions to build the world's largest hydroelectric power station with a power generation capacity of 2 million kilowatts in Kuibyshev on the Volga River and the Stalingrad hydroelectric power station with a power generation capacity of 1.7 million kilowatts in the next five or six years; to excavate the longest Grand Canal in the contemporary world, which is 1,100 kilometers long, in Turkmenistan, and to build three hydroelectric power stations along the canal, and to build a 1,200-kilometer water supply canal to irrigate the land in the desert area; to excavate the South Ukraine Canal and the North Crimea Canal, which are interconnected and 550 kilometers long in Ukraine, and to build the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station with a power generation capacity of 250,000 kilowatts on the Dnieper River. Reservoirs will be built in the hydroelectric power station to improve shipping traffic. In the irrigated areas of hydroelectric power stations and canals, protective forest belts will be widely planted to change the climatic conditions in arid areas, to open up large areas of grain fields and cotton fields that yield a good harvest every year, and to greatly develop livestock breeding, so that socialist countries can move towards further prosperity.

    These great construction works of the Soviet Union fully demonstrate the strength and growth of the Soviet Union's national power. The total power generation capacity of the newly built hydroelectric power stations reaches 4.25 million kilowatts, which is equivalent to two-fifths of the total power generation capacity of the Soviet Union before the war in 1940, and one-fifth of the total power generation capacity when the post-war five-year plan is completed. The United States, however, only increased its hydropower generation by 2.46 billion kilowatt-hours between 1945 and 1948, which is equivalent to one-quarter of the power generation capacity of a Kuibyshev hydroelectric power station. The Turkmen Grand Canal will conquer 7 million hectares of desert land in six years, while the United States has only conquered 8 million hectares of desert in 100 years. This once again fully illustrates the infinite superiority of the socialist system.

    The great peaceful construction of the Soviet Union also demonstrates the infinite prosperity of Soviet advanced science. The Stalingrad hydroelectric power station is located where the Volga River flows through the plains, which was previously considered impossible to utilize water power. The construction of the hydroelectric power station shows the new development of Soviet science in utilizing water flow. Soviet scientists have dedicated all their wisdom to support the construction work, and the Soviet Academy of Sciences has organized a special committee to assist the construction work, and has formed an inspection team to go to the project area to study engineering, agriculture, irrigation, and animal husbandry issues to facilitate the construction work. Soviet engineers are working together on the construction site to study the design and execution of the project, or are manufacturing complex equipment in factories. This socialist scientific creative collectivism is the material and technical basis for the realization of great peaceful construction.

    The great peaceful construction of the Soviet Union has become a huge driving force for the movement to defend peace. When the imperialists are conspiring to expand the war, the Soviet people are so calm and composed in carrying out constructive labor, using the fruits of labor to defend peace. This increases the confidence and strength of the people of the world to win peace, and makes them doubly determined to carry out the struggle for peace and more firmly stand in the peace camp.

    朝鲜人民坚决抗击美国侵略者
    美国侵略者指使它在南朝鲜的走狗李承晚傀儡集团发动冒险进攻，并随即公开进行对朝鲜的侵略战争，迄今已三个多月。在战争的开头两个多月内，美国侵略者过低估计了朝鲜人民的力量，遭受到朝鲜人民军的沉重打击，并被人民军压缩到朝鲜东南海岸的一小片土地上，面临被赶下海的命运。美国侵略者为了企图挽救覆灭的命运，达到它侵略全朝鲜的目的，于九月十五日在朝鲜战场投下了更大的赌注，动员了目前在远东所能使用的全部海、陆、空军，拚凑了七个仆从国家、李承晚傀儡集团及日本法西斯的船舰和兵力，在仁川登陆，并在付出伤亡一万四千人的惨重代价之后，于九月三十日侵占了汉城。目前，朝鲜人民军正坚决抗击企图继续北犯的敌军；同时为了适应战局的新变化，朝鲜人民军已主动地自南方撤退，以便集中力量，更有力的打击侵犯者。
    美国侵略者对朝鲜加紧进行的军事冒险，无疑给朝鲜人民的解放事业带来了新的困难，但是美国侵略者妄图征服朝鲜人民的迷梦，是注定要破产的，而朝鲜人民将在长期抗战中，赢得解放斗争的最后胜利。在美国侵略者实行进一步扩大侵略战争的冒险之后，不仅将更遭受全世界人民的反对而在政治上将更加孤立，而且在军事上也将陷于很不利的地位。首先，美国侵略军的冒险深入，使它的战线拉长，兵力分散。南朝鲜广大的地区在解放之后，已经进行了土地改革，成立了新的各级人民政权。人民的觉悟程度和组织程度，已经提高和加强。美国侵略者孤军深入，侵占一些点和线，必然加重自己的危机。美联社记者不得不承认：“共产党军队是最危险最坚决的敌人。他们在各处以及美军后方，都有小批部队分布着。……情报地图上代表敌人游击队的小红点，散布在整个南朝鲜。……朝鲜战争离结束之期还远得很。”其次，美国侵略军是远涉重洋在他国领土上作战，离开后方太远，军事供应极为困难。战争拖长，消耗巨大，困难就会日益增加，弱点就会更加暴露。再次，美国师出无名，士气不高，加上美国军队的腐败和贪生怕死，因此战斗力很弱，随着战争的延长，这方面的弱点就将越发明显。
    因此，朝鲜人民不管会经历如何的艰苦和困难，他们在长期抗战的方针下，在世界人民的声援下，必能披荆斩棘地取得最后胜利。
    联大两条路线的斗争
    联合国大会第五届会议已于九月十九日在纽约开幕。这届大会是在美国帝国主义已在朝鲜发动侵略战争，并力图扩大侵略战争的形势下举行的。因此，在联合国大会上进行保卫和平的斗争，乃是全世界人民当前紧急的任务。作为和平民主阵营领袖的苏联代表团在大会开幕会议上，即首先提出了要开除国民党代表，邀请我中央人民政府代表出席大会的提案，以保卫联合国的合法性。而在九月二十日大会开始一般辩论时，苏联代表维辛斯基又提出“制止新战争威胁，巩固世界和平与安全宣言”的提案，要求大会明确宣布：（一）谴责新战争宣传。（二）无条件禁止原子武器，视任何首先使用此类大规模杀人武器的政府为战争罪犯。（三）美、英、法、中、苏五强缔结巩固和平的公约，并首先各自立即裁军三分之一，以此来确保实现和平与安全。在大会政治委员会开始审议朝鲜问题以后，为了和平解决朝鲜问题，苏联又会同乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克五国，提出了要求在朝鲜的交战双方立即停战，外国军队立即撤退，由全朝鲜人民自由选举以建立统一独立的全国政府的联合提案。
    苏联与人民民主国家所有这些行动，正如真理报所指出的：都明白地指出了和平的正确道路，道出了整个进步人类保卫和平的意志。
    与此完全相反的是美国帝国主义的行动。它首先在大会开幕会议上，操纵多数否决了要求开除国民党代表，邀请我中央人民政府代表的苏联提案，蓄意使联合国处于非法状态。而在九月二十日全体会议上，美国国务卿艾奇逊又提出了企图改变联合国宪章，破坏联合国组织的四点方案，借以摧毁联合国的主要机构——以大国一致原则为基础的安全理事会，而代之以在美国多数控制下的联合国大会，以便美国得以为所欲为地将联合国完全变成其进一步侵略的遮羞布。在九月三十日联大政治委员会上，美国又唆使英、澳等八个仆从国家，提出由联合国成立委员会在与麦克阿瑟的所谓“联合国统一司令部”商议下成立“独立与统一”的朝鲜全国政府的提案，以为美国进一步占领朝鲜寻找借口。
    迄今为止，联合国大会正围绕着上述议案而展开了激烈的斗争。美国在这个斗争中的态度，清楚地说明了美国的目的是要把联合国完全变成进行侵略的工具，以便利它扩大战争，而苏联与人民民主国家则代表全世界爱好和平的人民的意志，坚决为挫败美国的阴谋，为保卫联合国与保卫世界和平而奋斗。美国虽然操纵着大会多数的表决机器，但是由于它已在全世界人民面前更加暴露了自己的侵略面目，而日益趋于孤立，而苏联与人民民主国家的提案，则已博得了全世界民主舆论的衷心拥护。
    与联合国大会同时，安全理事会正继续进行关于控诉美国武装侵略台湾案。虽然美国自八月底以来一再多方阻挠，但是在苏联代表的坚持下，安理会已不得不在九月二十九日会议上通过一项提案，邀请我中华人民共和国代表参加安理会在十一月十五日以后讨论我国控诉美国侵略台湾案的会议。我国人民坚决反对美国侵略我国领土台湾和侵犯我国领空，轰炸扫射我国人民，坚持要求联合国制裁美国侵略者并令美国侵略军自台湾和朝鲜撤退。
    苏联的伟大和平建设
    在苏联战后五年经济计划即将胜利完成的前夕，苏联部长会议接连发布决定，要在今后的五、六年内，在伏尔加河上建设世界上最大的发电能力达二百万千瓦的古比雪夫水电站，和发电能力达一百七十万千瓦的斯大林格勒水电站；在土库曼开凿长达一千一百公里的当代世界上最长的大运河，并沿运河兴建三座水电站，修筑一千二百公里的供水渠，以灌溉沙漠地区的土地；在乌克兰开凿互相通连全长达五百五十公里的南乌克兰运河和北克里米亚运河，并要在第聂伯河上建立发电能力达二十五万千瓦的卡霍夫卡水电站。在水电站将要建设蓄水池，以改善航运交通。在水电站及运河的灌溉区域内，将要广泛种植防护林带，以改变干旱地区的气候条件，以增辟大片年年丰收的谷田和棉田，并将大量发展牲畜饲养事业，使社会主义国家走向进一步的繁荣。
    苏联这些伟大的建设的工作，充分显现了苏联国力的雄厚与增涨。新建的水电站发电能力的总和达四百二十五万千瓦，相当于战前一九四○年苏联发电总能力的五分之二，相当于战后五年计划完成时发电总能力的五分之一。而美国在一九四五年到一九四八年间，水力发电量不过增加了二十四亿六千万千瓦时，即相当于古比雪夫一个水电站发电量的四分之一。土库曼大运河在六年之内将征服七百万公顷的沙漠土地，而美国在一百年间不过征服了八百万公顷的沙漠。这就再一次地充分说明了社会主义制度的无限优越。
    苏联的伟大和平建设也说明了苏维埃先进科学的无限繁荣。斯大林格勒水电站地当伏尔加流经平原之处，在以前是认为没有利用水力的可能的。水电站的建立说明了苏联科学利用水流的新发展。苏联科学家为支持建设工作而献出了全部智慧，苏联科学院已组织了专门的委员会来协助建设工作的进行，并已组成考察队，分赴工程地区研究工程、农业、灌溉、畜牧上的问题，以利建设工作的进行。苏联工程师正在建筑现场群策群力地研究工程的设计与执行，或在工厂里制造着复杂的装备。这种社会主义科学的创造性的集体主义，便是伟大和平建设得以实现的物质的与技术的基础。
    苏联的伟大和平建设已成为保卫和平运动的巨大推动力量。苏联人民在帝国主义者阴谋扩大战争的时候，如此镇定沉着地从事着建设性的劳动，用劳动的果实来保卫和平。这就给全世界人民增加了赢取和平的信心和力量，使他们加倍坚强地进行争取和平的斗争，更加坚决地站进和平阵营中来。
