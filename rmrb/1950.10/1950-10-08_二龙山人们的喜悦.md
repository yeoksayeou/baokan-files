　　The Successful Trial of New Farm Tools

　　In January of this year, Qi Baoen, the mutual aid team leader of Erlongshan Village, Shuangliao County, Liaoxi Province, and a first-class labor model of the province, received a complete set of Soviet-style animal-drawn farm tools from the Northeast People's Government Agricultural and Forestry Department. This was a novelty for Erlongshan. Farmers looked at it with curious and suspicious eyes. Some people said, "This thing, each one looks like an artillery piece, can it be useful?" Some people said, "This thing can only plow flat, not ridge. It’s good, but it can’t be used in our place!" Others said, "Craftsmen don't make useless things. Let's try it and see if it works!" Only Qi Baoen had attended the Northeast Mutual Aid Team Leaders Conference and the Provincial Labor Model Conference. He understood the benefits of new farm tools. He had firm confidence and was determined to conduct a good experiment to gain experience so that new farm tools could be promoted more widely. He explained to everyone at any time and place: We must be liberated from the old farm tools to improve productivity and make production better.

　　This spring, the snow on the ground melted, and Soviet-style land reclamation plows began to gallop on the Erlongshan grassland. In ten days, 150 mu of wasteland was opened. Because the plowing was deep, the weeds were all pressed underneath, and the opened land became cultivated land. Immediately afterwards, spring plowing began. Qi Baoen led everyone to plant 35 mu of spring wheat (newly reclaimed land), 5 mu of soybeans, 25 mu of millet, 35 mu of broomcorn millet, 6 mu of corn, and 15 mu of sorghum with a seeder. In two days, all 120 mu of land were planted. Because the new seeder was used, it greatly saved manpower and animal power. Only four human laborers and four animal laborers were used for 120 mu of land. If old farm tools were used for sowing, two sets of plows would be required, and it would take three and a half days, using fourteen human laborers and fourteen animal laborers. The land sown with the seeder was evenly sown, evenly covered with soil, and the seedlings emerged neatly and looked particularly good. At this time, the masses began to be interested in and have confidence in using new farm tools such as land reclamation plows and seeders. During summer weeding, the Soviet animal-drawn cultivator was the most popular. Because it is easy to use and the depth adjustment is appropriate, one *xiang* of land can save two labor days. Erlongshan used this cultivator to cultivate 320 mu of land.

　　There were also difficulties in using new farm tools. For example, the seed delivery pipe of the seeder was too thin, and attempts have been made to improve it during use. At the same time, the method of flat plowing is only an experiment in the local area, and no one is completely sure whether it will succeed. To avoid failure, they adopted a method of combining the new and the old, and ridged the land sown with the seeder with old plows so that it could be cultivated. At the same time, to test the effect of flat plowing, the 35 mu of wheat sown with the seeder were neither ridged nor cultivated. As a result, this wheat grew particularly well, with the tallest being more than four feet tall, a head taller than that planted with old plows. The people discussed one after another: Wheat cannot be grown at all on wasteland opened with old plows. Unexpectedly, this piece of land grew so well. On the day of harvest, more than 300 people from other villages came here to visit. They watched as the rocker arm harvester drove into the wheat field, the horses pulled the machine forward, and the wheat fell behind. In more than half a day, all 35 mu of wheat were harvested. The audience exclaimed, "This thing is really easy to use. If it were harvested manually, four labor days would be required for ten mu of land. Thirty-five mu of land would require fourteen labor days. It only took two animals and two people, and it was harvested in more than half a day. It is really fast and saves labor!" Some people calculated and said, "I don't know how much this machine costs. Next year, let's organize a few families to buy one."

　　Even more exciting was August 2nd, the day of threshing wheat with a thresher. Horses were the power of the thresher. The horses were walking, and the machine was turning. The working machine opened its throat wide and swallowed the ears of wheat from the front, spitting out the wheat straw from the side, and what leaked out from the bottom were piles of clean wheat grains. On this day, more than 100 people from other villages came here to visit, and two large carts from distant villages that were going to the market also stopped to watch for more than an hour. An old man Zhang from Zhangwu County went to Xin'an Town to do errands and made a detour to see the "world". Everyone who visited praised the machine for being "powerful"! Qi Baoen and everyone in Erlongshan looked at the golden wheat grains and heard the people's praise, and their faces were filled with victorious and happy smiles. From land reclamation to harvesting, the 35 mu of wheat cultivated entirely with new farm tools yielded a total of 2,200 jin. The average yield per mu was more than 62 jin. Everyone in Erlongshan felt very surprised because normally only 30 jin of wheat can be harvested per mu on the same land. After analysis and research, everyone knew that the reason was that the soil cultivated with new farm tools was loose, with more seedlings and even distribution, so it could produce more grain.

　　After the wheat was threshed, they wiped the thresher with oil and carefully placed it in the farm tool room. During the autumn harvest, there are 450 mu of sorghum, millet, buckwheat, and small mung beans that are being prepared for threshing with the thresher!

　　Organizing to Create a New Life

　　This year, Erlongshan cultivated a total of 1,350 mu of land. Sixteen households, seventeen male laborers, each cultivated an average of more than 80 mu of land. If they were not organized, they would not be able to manage so much land. All 28 women in the village were also organized to participate in agricultural production, responsible for cultivating vegetable gardens, cotton, weeding, and seedling pulling. During summer weeding, insect pests occurred on six *xiang* of land. The women mobilized and caught all the insects in less than two days. Because of the high efficiency of organization and careful cultivation, the wheat has already had a bumper harvest this year; the autumn crops are also growing lush and strong.

　　The lives of the farmers in Erlongshan this year are different from those of previous years, and every family has surplus grain. During the busy farming season, every family eats *bobos*. Last year, only one pig was slaughtered in the entire village of sixteen households for the Dragon Boat Festival. This year, two pigs were slaughtered for the Dragon Boat Festival. There was no improvement in life during the wheat harvest last year, but a pig was slaughtered during the wheat harvest this year. Dressing is also different from previous years. This spring, the entire village bought more than 40 *zhang* of fine cloth at one time, not counting the retail purchases. Adults and children all changed into fine cloth single clothes. Xu Futing's wife said, "This year is really much better than last year. I bought seven *zhang* of fine cloth, and everyone, big and small, changed into new clothes, and I also made two large shirts. Last year, I wore coarse cloth, which I dyed myself with the mud from the stinky water pit." Qi Baoen said, "Once, I wore a small cotton-padded jacket during the hottest days of summer. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, such poor days will never come again."

　　The people of Erlongshan have not only improved their material lives, but what is even more worth mentioning is their cultural life. Qi Baoen's wife, Wang Shuqin, had gone to school for two years, and she is the only "cultured person" in Erlongshan. Under her leadership, the literacy class in Erlongshan is well organized. On the walls of the borrowed classroom are written the twelve large characters: "Strengthen mutual assistance, study culture, and improve production." Their learning is closely integrated with production and has not been interrupted during the busy farming season. During the summer weeding season, more than 20 women used the noon break to study. Now eight women and four men in the village can keep track of labor exchange accounts. Some people can recognize 500 characters, and the least can recognize 200 characters. Li Yunqing, a 15-year-old girl, has already recognized more than 500 characters. After she learned the characters, she went back to teach her mother, and wrote the characters on the stove, water tank, and chest, wrote her mother's name on the wall of the *kang*, and wrote "Chairman Mao" on the beam. Li's mother said, "My girl is afraid that I will forget, so she wrote the characters under my eyelids. As soon as I see an object, I think of the character." In Erlongshan, no matter which family you walk into, you can see white chalk characters all over the walls. Liaoxi Daily and Liaoxi Pictorial are also regular reading materials for the masses in Erlongshan. They like Liaoxi Pictorial the most because they can read the pictures and recognize the characters at the same time. Twelve copies have been subscribed by sixteen households.

　　Now they are busy composting manure, collecting *yang* grass, and preparing to select seeds. They have already planted 2,000 poplar trees in the spring, and plan to plant another 5,000 in the autumn. In a few years, Erlongshan will be surrounded by greenery; the wind and sand blowing from Mongolia will also be blocked outside the jungle.

　　二龙山人们的喜悦
    杨坚白
    新农具的试用成功了
    今年一月，辽西省双辽县二龙山村的互助组长、省一等劳动模范齐宝恩，从东北人民政府农林部领回了全套的苏联式马拉农具，这是二龙山开天辟地以来的新鲜事。农民们都以新奇和惊疑的眼光来看它。有的人说：“这玩艺，一个个的像个炮车，能好使吗？”有的人说：“这家伙，只能平作，不能起垅，好是好，就是咱这地方不能用！”还有的人说：“匠人不作废物，好使不好使，试一试看吧！”只有齐宝恩参加过东北的互助组长会，到省开过劳模会，懂得了新农具的好处，他有坚定的信心，一定要好好试验，取得经验，以便使新农具更广泛的推广开来。他随时随地的向大家解释：必须从旧农具中解放出来，才能提高生产力，把生产搞得更好。
    今年春天，地上的积雪融消了，二龙山的大草原上开始驰骋着苏联式的开荒犁。十天的工夫，开了一百五十亩荒。因为开的深，野草全压在底下，开出来就变成了熟地。紧接着便开始春耕。齐宝恩带着大伙，用播种机种了春小麦三十五亩（新开荒地），大豆五亩，谷子二十五亩，糜子三十五亩，玉茭六亩，高粱十五亩，两天的工夫，就把一百二十亩地全种上了。因为使用了新式的播种机，大大节省了人力和畜力，一百二十亩地，只用了四个人工、四个畜工；若是用旧农具播种，就得套两付犁杖，种三天半，用十四个人工和十四个畜工。用播种机种的地，因为种撒的匀，土盖的匀，苗儿出得齐齐整整，分外好看。到这时候，群众对使用开荒犁、播种机等新式农具，就开始发生兴趣，并有了信心。夏锄中，最受欢迎的还是苏联的马拉铲趟机。因为它使用起来轻便，深浅调节又合适，一垧地可以省两个工。二龙山一共用这个铲趟机铲趟了三百二十亩地。
    使用新农具，困难也是存在的。例如播种机的输种管太细，在使用过程中已设法改进。同时，平作方法在当地还只是一个试验，能否成功，谁也没有十足的把握；为了避免失败，他们采用新旧结合的方法，把用播种机种的地，又用旧犁杖起了垅，这样就可以铲趟了。同时，为试验平作的效果，用播种机种的三十五亩麦子，没有起垅，也没有铲趟。结果，这块麦子长的特别好，最高的有四尺多高，比用旧犁杖种的高出一头。老百姓纷纷地议论着：用旧犁杖开的荒，根本就不能种麦子。没想到这块地长的这样好。到了收割的那一天，外村的人，前前后后有三百多人到这里参观。他们眼看着摇臂式收割机开进了麦地，马拉着机器向前走，麦子随着在后面倒下来。半天多的工夫，就把三十五亩麦子全部割完了。观众们赞叹地说：“这玩艺真好使，若是用人工拔麦子，十亩地就要用四个工。三十五亩地得用十四个工，这才用两头牲口、两个人，半天多就割完了，真是又快又省工！”有的人盘算着说：“这个机器不知道多少钱，明年咱们也组织几家买上一架。”
    更精彩的是八月二日，这是用脱谷机打麦子的一天。马是脱谷机的动力。马在走，机器在转动。工作机张大着喉咙，从正面吞进了麦穗，从旁面吐出了麦秸，底下漏出来的都是洁净的一堆堆的麦粒。这一天又有一百多外村的人到这里来参观，有两辆远村赶集的大车，也停下车看了一个多钟头。彰武县一个老张头去新安镇办事，也特意绕道来见一见“世面”。所有参观的人没有一个人不赞扬这个机器“赶劲”！齐宝恩以及二龙山的每个人看着金黄色的麦粒，听到人们的赞扬，他们的脸上都浮现出胜利的愉快的微笑。从开荒到收割，全是用新农具耕作的三十五亩麦子，一共打了二千二百斤。每亩平均产量是六十二斤多。二龙山的人大家都感到很惊奇，因为平常种同样的地一亩只能打三十斤麦子。大家经过分析、研究，知道原因是使用新农具耕作的地，土头松，多苗而匀，所以能多打粮。
    麦子打完了，他们把脱谷机擦上了油，细心的安放在农具房里。秋收时，有四百五十亩地的高粱、糜子、荞麦和小绿豆等，都在准备着用脱谷机打呢！
    组织起来创造了新生活
    今年的二龙山，一共种了一千三百五十亩地。十六户人家，十七个男劳动力，每人平均耕种八十多亩地，若不是组织起来，这些地就养种不过来了。全村二十八名妇女，也组织起来参加了农业生产，负责养种菜园、棉花和薅草、拔苗等。夏锄中，有六垧地发生了虫害，妇女们出动了，不到两天就把虫子捉光了。由于组织起来效率大，耕作周到，今年的麦子已经丰收；大秋庄稼，也长得丰肥壮硕。
    今年二龙山农民的生活，已经不同于往年，家家都有了余粮。农忙时期，家家吃饽饽。去年过端阳节，全村十六户人家只杀了一口猪，今年的端阳节就杀了两口。去年麦收时没有改善生活，今年麦收时杀了一口猪。穿衣裳也不同于往年了。今年春天，全村一次就买了四十多丈细布，零买的还没算在内。大人小孩都换上了细布单衣。许福廷的老婆说：“今年真比去年强多啦。买了七丈细布，大大小小都换上了新衣，还做了两件大衫。去年穿的是粗布，还是用臭水坑的污泥自己染的。”齐宝恩说：“从前有一年，我穿着小棉袄过三伏天。在共产党的领导下，那样穷苦的日子是不会再来了。”
    二龙山的人们，不仅物质生活上升了，更值得提起的是他们的文化生活。齐宝恩的妻子王淑琴，从前上过二年学，她是二龙山唯一的“文化人”。在她的领导下，二龙山的识字班组织得很好。在借用的教室的墙壁上写着：“加强互助，学习文化，提高生产”十二个大字。他们的学习是和生产紧紧结合着的，农忙时也没有间断。夏锄期间，二十多名妇女，利用晌午休息的时间学习。现在全村已有八个妇女，四个男人能记换工账了。有些人认到五百字，少的也认到二百字。李云青是个十五岁的小姑娘，已认识了五百多字。她学会了字就回去教她妈妈，在锅台、水缸、箱柜上都写上了字，把她妈妈的名字写在炕头的墙上，把“毛主席”写在大梁上。李老太太说：“俺姑娘怕我忘啦，把字都写在我眼皮底下，一看见物件就想起字来了。”在二龙山，任凭你走进那一家，都可以看到满墙的白粉笔字。辽西日报和辽西画报，也是二龙山群众的经常读物。他们最喜欢的是辽西画报，因为能够连看图带认字，十六户人家已经订了十二份。
    现在他们正忙于沤粪积肥，打洋草，准备选种。春天他们已经栽了两千棵杨树，秋天计划再栽五千棵。几年之后，二龙山将处在绿树丛的包围中；从蒙古吹过来的风沙，也将被阻止在丛林外面了。
