　　The Soviet People's Contribution to the Great Cause of Peace
    (Vice-Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee, Tè·Yèshàowǎ)
    The signature campaign for the Stockholm Appeal in the Soviet Union has announced its results. The result is extremely impressive: during the 32 days of the campaign (from June 30th to August 1st), 115,275,940 Soviet citizens signed the Stockholm Appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. On June 29th, the Soviet Peace Committee called on the people to sign. On July 5th, 57,000,000 people had signed; on July 10th, the number jumped to 96,000,000, and by August 1st, the signature campaign was completed. The entire adult population of the Soviet Union unanimously declared a ban on atomic weapons, and condemned any government that first uses it against any country as a war criminal.
    The great significance of this national vote for peace cannot be overestimated. The 115,000,000 Soviet citizens who signed the Stockholm Appeal have once again demonstrated their unwavering determination to defend peace, unite all nations, and effectively safeguard peace.
    This establishment of the foundation for lasting peace is consistent with the deepest and greatest interests of all working people in the Soviet Union, who are engaged in constructive labor and successfully building a communist society.
    Since the establishment of the Soviet state, promoting and safeguarding world peace has been the cornerstone of the Soviet government's Leninist-Stalinist foreign policy. The Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government—with all our nations rallied around them, consolidated and united—have won the respect, gratitude, and support of the masses of people around the world for their consistent and tireless struggle for peace. All of progressive humanity and the organized international peace front see the Soviet Union and its people as a loyal and reliable fortress.
    In the Soviet Union, the nature, development, and results of the signature campaign provide many proofs of the Soviet people's determination to contribute their strength and creativity to opposing the instigators of new wars and strengthening the main pillar of peace, the strength of the Soviet Union.
    When signing the Stockholm Appeal, the Soviet people also expressed their heartfelt and unanimous admiration for the Soviet government's wise Stalinist policy of peace.
    The people of all sixteen republics of our Union enthusiastically supported the work of the Soviet Peace Committee to collect signatures for the Stockholm Appeal. To help with this signature campaign, hundreds of committees were established under the initiative of public organizations such as factories, collective farms, state farms, schools, institutions, and public housing. These committees guiding the signatures are representatives of Soviet public opinion, and their members include active trade union members, members of the Communist Youth League, scientists, and artists. Among the propagandists collecting signatures, many were decorated for their bravery in the Great Patriotic War. They certainly understand the meaning of war, which is why they are so serious and persuasive when they call for signatures on the Stockholm Appeal. Our largest mass organizations, trade unions, youth leagues, and other organizations called on the people to sign.
    It would be difficult to calculate the number of gatherings convened in every town and village across the vast territory of the Soviet Union during this movement. These gatherings were convened by workers, collective farmers, writers, artists, actors, scientists, engineers, and students—young and old, representing all walks of life. They were all inspired by a single conviction to maintain peace and continue their constructive labor, and they declared their determination and will to fight for a consolidated and lasting peace. Aleksey Ayanov, a member of the Bolshevik collective fishing farm in the Astrakhan region, said:
    "Today, the voice of the Soviet people is spreading all over the world: we sponsor peace, we support peace, and we are determined to continue to support peace. We do not need war, just as no honest person in the world needs it. The idea of war is contrary to us and incompatible with us. We need peace, we need to dedicate our great strength, our knowledge and energy to the work of construction, to the magnificent edifice of building a communist society! When I signed the Stockholm Appeal, I had only one thought: my voice, the voice of an ordinary Caspian fisherman, will be able to join the voices of my fellow villagers, the peoples of our country, and all honest men and women who hold the belief of freedom and peace. This voice will be a stern warning to the warmongers of Britain and the United States."
    "The people will not allow a new war," said Ashenev, a model maker at the Tarman factory in Leningrad. "When we sign the Stockholm Appeal, we are filled with a deep love and gratitude for the Bolshevik Party and the great Stalin, for everything they have done for the prosperity and happiness of our country."
    Tatyana Valetskaya, a member of the Novaya Zhizn collective farm in the Krasnoyarsk region, said at a gathering of collective farmers in her village:
    "I am a mother with ten children, and I hope to see them all happy. All Soviet mothers demand peace, and under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and our great leader Comrade Stalin, we will achieve peace."
    The significance of defending peace is, first and foremost, to actively oppose the British and American warmongers. That is why in the Soviet Union, the Stockholm Appeal signature campaign was also a broad protest demonstration against the American intervention in Korea. Soviet citizens condemned this crime and demanded that the United States stop its aggression against the freedom-loving Korean people.
    V. Yakovlev, People's Artist of the Russian Soviet Socialist Republic, wrote:
    "The sons and daughters of my great Soviet motherland are engaged in peaceful and creative labor. We are planting new orchards, building new elementary schools and universities, and creating works of art. On the other hand, the imperialists are always calculating how to destroy the creations of human genius. The profit-seeking journalists of America are constantly calculating the value of a new slaughterhouse, and the damned merchants are looking forward to the benefits that the slaughterhouse will bring them.
    "My friends, artists everywhere! Demand that the American imperialists stop the war they launched in Korea. Demand world peace.
    "Condemn the instigators of new wars, the British and American imperialists!"
    Every Soviet citizen enthusiastically does his utmost to enhance the strength of his country, the reliable fortress of world peace.
    In our factories, workers and staff members have made selfless efforts to enhance the economic strength of the Soviet Union, guaranteeing the signatures on the Stockholm Appeal; because strengthening the strength of the Soviet state means strengthening the peace front. The socialist competition for higher labor productivity and more over-planned production is developing with new strength in this movement.
    Millions of working people have guaranteed that they will double their efforts in production as a contribution to the fight for peace. When signing the Stockholm Appeal, workers in steel, automobile, engineering, textile, and other industrial sectors produced double the steel, automobiles, machines, tools, fabrics, and other goods, exceeding the production plan.
    Advanced Soviet citizens of peace and democracy, by signing the Stockholm Appeal, issued a stern warning to the worshippers of the atomic bomb, reminding them that the peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet government is supported by the entire Soviet people and the entire Soviet state.
    There is no doubt that the effect of the Stockholm Appeal signature campaign in the Soviet Union will be an encouraging example for peace advocates in every corner of the earth, strengthening their belief in the invincibility of the forces of peace. The international peace front is growing in strength and expanding its scope. New millions of people are participating in the selfless struggle against the imperialist warmongers and defending peace. The strength of the peace movement is increasingly developing into an invincible force, capable of seizing the torch of the new world from the fanatical warmongers and successfully safeguarding the cause of world peace.

　　苏联人民对伟大的和平事业的贡献
    （苏联和平委员会副主席  特·叶绍瓦）
    斯德哥尔摩宣言签名运动，在苏联已经宣布了结果。这个结果是极为可观的：在运动的三十二天中（从六月三十日到八月一日），一一五，二七五，九四○个苏联公民在世界保卫和平大会常设委员会斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。六月二十九日，苏联和平委员会号召人民签名。七月五日，有五七，○○○，○○○人签名；七月十日，数目字跃升至九六，○○○，○○○，及至八月一日，签名运动已经完成了。苏联全体的成年人一致宣言禁止原子武器，宣判第一个使用它反对任何国家的政府为战犯。
    这个对和平的全国表决的重大意义是决不会过高地估计了的。签名在斯德哥尔摩宣言上的一一五，○○○，○○○个苏联公民又一次地显示了他们保卫和平，联合一切民族，有效的保卫和平的不屈不挠的决心。
    这个为永久和平的基础的建立，与苏联全体劳动人民的最深最大的利益是一致的，他们正在从事着建设的劳动，成功地建设着共产主义社会。
    自苏维埃国家建立之日起，增进与保卫世界和平就成为苏联政府列宁斯大林外交政策的奠基石。布尔什维克党和苏联政府——我国各民族环绕在他们的周围，巩固地团结起来——所一贯从事的，为争取和平的不懈斗争给苏联赢得了全世界人民群众的尊敬、感激与支持。整个进步的人类和已经组织起来了的国际和平阵线，从苏联及其人民中看到了一个忠诚可靠的堡垒。
    在苏联，签名运动的性质、发展及结果提供了许多证明，证明了苏联人民为反对新战争的煽动者，及加强保卫和平的主要支柱——苏联的力量而贡献他们的力量及创造力的决心。
    苏联人民在签名于斯德哥尔摩宣言上时，并表示了他们对苏联政府的英明的斯大林和平外交政策的衷心一致赞扬。
    我们联盟的十六个共和国中的各民族都热情地支持苏联和平委员会为斯德哥尔摩宣言募集签名的工作。为帮助这一签名运动，千百个委员会在工厂、集体农庄、国家农场、学校、机关及公共住宅等公共组织的发起下建立起来。这些指导签名的委员会是苏维埃公众舆论的代表，他们的成份包括积极的职工会会员，少年共产主义青年团团员，科学家及艺术家。在征集签名的宣传者中，很多都是在伟大卫国战争中以勇敢而被授与勋章的人。他们当然十分懂得战争的意义，这就是为什么他们呼吁签名于斯德哥尔摩宣言上时，会如此的严肃而又富于说服力。我们最大的群众组织，职工会，青年团及其它组织号召了人民签名。
    在这个运动中，把全苏联宽广的领土上，每个城镇、乡村所召开过的集会数目计算一下，该是困难的事情吧。这些集会是由工人、集体农民、作家、艺术家、演员、科学家、工程师及学生——年青的和年老的，代表着各种职业的人所召集的。他们全都被一个保持和平，继续他们的建设劳动的单一信念所鼓舞着，他们宣布他们为巩固的持久和平而斗争的决心及意志。阿斯特拉罕区，布尔什维克集体渔场成员之一，亚列克塞·阿扬诺夫说：
    “今天苏联人民的声音传遍了全世界：我们赞助和平，拥护和平，我们决心仍将继续拥护和平。我们不需要战争，正如世界上任何一个诚实的人不需要它一样。战争的思想是与我们背道而驰，不能相容的。我们需要和平，我们需要把我们的巨大力量，我们的知识及精力贡献在建设的工作上，贡献在建筑共产主义社会的庄严巨厦上！当我签名在斯德哥尔摩宣言上时，我只有一个思想：我的声音，一个普通的里海渔夫的声音，将能与我的同村的人，我们国家的各族人民，和怀抱自由和平信念的、所有正直的男女们的声音一道发出。这个声音，对于英美的战争贩子们将是一个严厉的警告。”
    “人民不会允许一个新的战争，”列宁格勒塔尔门工厂中一个模型制作工人阿申也夫说：“我们签名于斯德哥尔摩宣言上时，是怀着一种对布尔什维克党及伟大的斯大林深深的敬爱与感激的情绪的，由于他们为我们国家的繁荣与幸福所完成的每一件事情。”
    克拉斯诺雅斯克区，诺瓦亚·日恩集体农庄的庄员塔特扬娜·瓦列斯喀娅，在其同村的集体农民集会上说：
    “我是一个有着十个儿童的母亲，我希望眼见着他们全都快活。所有的苏维埃的母亲们都要求和平，在布尔什维克党及我们的伟大的领袖斯大林同志的领导下，我们将完成和平。”
    保卫和平的意义，首先就是积极地反对英美战争贩子们。这就是为什么在苏联，斯德哥尔摩宣言签名运动同时是一个反对美国干涉朝鲜的广泛抗议性的示威运动的缘故。苏联的公民们宣判这种罪行，并要求美国停止对爱好自由的朝鲜人民的侵略。
    俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国的人民艺术家Ｖ·亚可夫列夫写道：
    “我的伟大的苏维埃祖国的各族儿女们正在从事着和平创造性的劳动。我们种植着新的果园，建立着新的小学和大学，创造着艺术作品。另一方面，帝国主义者却时刻计算着怎样毁灭人类天才的创作。美国的唯利是图的新闻记者们经常地盘算着一个新的屠宰场的价值，而该死的商人们则期待着这个屠场将要带给他们的利益。
    “我的朋友们，各地的艺术家们！要求美国帝国主义者停止他们在朝鲜发动的战争。要求全世界的和平。
    “谴责新战争的煽动者英美帝国主义分子！”
    每一个苏维埃公民都热情地尽其最大努力去增强这个世界和平可靠的堡垒，他的国家的力量。
    在我们的工厂里，工人和职员们以忘我的努力去增强苏联经济力量，给斯德哥尔摩宣言上的签名作了保证；因为加强了苏维埃国家的力量，即是加强了和平阵线。为更高的劳动生产力，及更多的超过计划的货物生产而掀起的社会主义竞赛，在这个运动中以新的力量发展着。
    千百万的劳动人民保证他们在生产中加倍努力，作为为和平而战的贡献。在签名于斯德哥尔摩宣言上时，钢铁、汽车、工程、纺织及其它工业部门的工人们生产出了加倍的钢铁、汽车、机器、工具、织物以及其他货物，超过了生产计划。
    和平与民主的先进的苏联公民，以签名在斯德哥尔摩宣言上，作为对原子弹崇拜者的一个严厉警告，提醒他们：苏联政府的和平外交政策是在全苏联人民和整个苏维埃国家支持下的。
    毫无疑义，斯德哥尔摩宣言签名运动在苏联所得到的效果，对于地球上每一个角落里的和平拥护者将是一个令人鼓舞的范例，强固了他们对和平力量不能战胜的信念。国际和平阵线正在生长着力量，扩大着范围。新的千百万人民群众正在参加反对帝国主义战争贩子，保卫和平的忘我的斗争。和平运动的力量正在日益地发展成为不可征服的力量，足能从狂热的战争贩子手中夺取新世界的火炬，成功地维护全世界的和平事业。
