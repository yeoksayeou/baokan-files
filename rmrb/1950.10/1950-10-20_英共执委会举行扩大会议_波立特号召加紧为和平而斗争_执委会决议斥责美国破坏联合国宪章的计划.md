Xinhua News Agency, London, 19th: According to a report by the Telecommunications Agency in London on the 16th, Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, delivered a speech at an expanded meeting of the CPGB Executive Committee held on the 14th, analyzing the current situation and tasks. Pollitt emphasized two important developments in the international situation: first, the unprecedented growth of the peace movement worldwide; second, the warmongers have entered into direct acts of aggression.

Pollitt exposed the policy of the capitalist countries as "not collective security for peace, but systematically establishing alliances with a new devil—the United States—to jointly oppose the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China, and national liberation movements everywhere." He pointed out that, in contrast to the war-mongering policies of capitalist countries, the Soviet Union is carrying out great communist construction for peace.

Pollitt said: "I want people to understand what it will mean if the World Peace Congress once again issues a historic declaration from one of the world's largest munitions manufacturing cities—a British city, Sheffield. This will show that there is another Britain that is different from the Britain of Attlee and Churchill." He emphasized the importance of intensifying the British peace movement, saying: "If a stronger and more powerful peace movement can be launched in Britain, then this movement will certainly play a decisive role in preventing a world war."

In his speech, Pollitt called for strengthening the struggle against the increasing decline in living standards, fully developing the trade union movement, demanding that the government repeal Order 1305, which undermines the right to strike, and strengthening and consolidating the party ranks.

Pollitt explained that the central aim of the British Communist Party's election policy is to fight for peace, unite all working-class forces and peace advocates to oppose the reactionary policies of the Conservative and right-wing Labour parties. To achieve this goal, the CPGB will put forward candidates; in constituencies without Communist candidates, in order to facilitate the unity of the working class, efforts will be made to ensure that Labour candidates pledge to fight for militant policies, and voters will be recommended to vote for Labour candidates.

Xinhua News Agency, London: According to a report by the Telecommunications Agency in London, the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party passed a resolution on October 14, condemning the U.S. plan to undermine the UN Charter. The resolution pointed out that the principle of unanimity among the great powers is the cornerstone of world peace. Acheson's plan is to completely destroy the principle of unanimity among the great powers, to hand over the power to decide on military action to the UN General Assembly, which is controlled by an American mechanical majority, in order to prepare for further military adventures against colonial peoples and to launch a war against the Soviet Union.

The resolution called on the British people to unite and fight to defend the UN Charter and to defeat the U.S. plan to launch a new world war.

　　英共执委会举行扩大会议
    波立特号召加紧为和平而斗争
    执委会决议斥责美国破坏联合国宪章的计划
    【新华社十九日讯】据电通社伦敦十六日讯：英国共产党总书记波立特，于十四日举行的英共执行委员会扩大会议上发表演说，分析目前形势与任务。波立特着重指出国际形势中两项重要发展：第一，世界范围内和平运动的空前壮大；第二，战争贩子业已进入直接的侵略行动。
    波立特揭露各资本主义国家的政策“不是集体保障和平，而是有系统地与新的魔鬼——美国——建立联盟，以共同反对苏联、东欧、中国与各地的民族解放运动”。他指出：与资本主义国家煽动战争政策相反，苏联正在进行伟大的共产主义的和平建设。
    波立特称：“我要人们了解：如果世界和平大会再一次发出历史性的宣言时，是从世界最大的制造军火城市之一——一个英国的城市设菲尔德发出的，这将具有什么意义。这将说明：还有另外一个与艾德礼、邱吉尔的英国不相同的英国存在。”他强调指出加紧英国和平运动的重要性说：“假如在英国能展开一个更加强大有力的和平运动，那么，这个运动在阻止世界大战方面必能起决定性的作用。”
    波立特在演说中号召：加强为反对生活水准日益下降而斗争，充分发展职工运动，要求政府撤消破坏罢工权利的一三○五号法令，加强并巩固党的队伍。
    波立特说明：英国共产党的选举政策的中心目的在于争取和平，团结一切工人阶级力量与和平拥护者，以反对保守党和右翼工党的反动政策。为达到这一目的，英共将提出候选人；在没有共产党候选人的选区，为便于工人阶级的团结，将设法使工党候选人保证为战斗性的政策而奋斗，并向选民推荐投工党候选人的票。
    【新华社十九日讯】据电通社伦敦讯：英国共产党执行委员会十月十四日通过决议，斥责美国破坏联合国宪章的计划。决议指出：大国一致原则乃是世界和平的基石。而艾奇逊的计划是要彻底摧毁大国一致原则，是要将军事行动的决定权交给美国控制机械多数的联合国大会，以准备进一步对殖民地人民进行军事冒险，并对苏联发动战争。
    决议号召英国人民团结起来，为维护联合国宪章、为挫败美国发动新的世界大战的计划而奋斗。
