　　If the American Empire dares to invade, beware, I will chop off its dog head!
　　Liu Kuiji, Combat Hero of the East China Military Region, Third Field Army
　　Today is the first National Day of our People's Republic of China. I have the opportunity to participate in the grand celebration held in the capital of our country, and I feel unspeakably happy.
　　On this day last year, I was in Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union. When the comrades of our Chinese youth delegation heard the news of the founding of the People's Republic of China, they immediately held a grand evening party at their residence. Our Soviet friends cheered and sang with us to celebrate this great festival.
　　A year has passed, and during this year, our great motherland, under the wise leadership of our beloved leader Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, has achieved many significant victories. On the military front, with the exception of Taiwan, Tibet, and other places, we have basically liberated the beautiful rivers and mountains of our motherland. On the economic front, our financial situation has begun to improve. These ironclad facts show that our great motherland, under the leadership of its wise leader Chairman Mao, is steadily moving forward!
　　However, the American imperialists and other war profiteers are afraid of peace and the new China's increasingly moving towards happiness, freedom, and prosperity. They are trying every possible means to sabotage and obstruct us. Their two crimes in Andong are clear evidence.
　　I—a combat hero of the Chinese People's Liberation Army—solemnly warn those bastards who are not even fit for dogs to eat, if they dare to extend their invading claws into the beautiful garden of our motherland, attempting to steal anything, beware, I will chop off its dog head!

　　美帝如果胆敢来侵略  当心我将斩掉他的狗头
    华东军区、三野战斗英雄  刘奎基
    今天是我们中华人民共和国的第一个国庆节，我有机会参加在我们祖国的京城所举行的庆祝盛典，心里真有说不出的高兴。
    去年今天我正在苏联的首都莫斯科，当我们中国青年代表团的同志们听到中华人民共和国成立的消息之后，随即在住地举行了盛大的晚会，苏联的朋友们和我们一起欢呼、歌唱，庆祝这伟大的节日。
    一年过去了，这一年的过程中，我们伟大的祖国，在我们敬爱的领袖毛主席、朱总司令的英明领导之下，又取得了许多重大的胜利。在军事战线上，除台湾、西藏等地之外，我们已经基本上解放了祖国的锦绣山河。在经济战线上，我们的财政经济已开始好转。这铁一般的事实，说明了我们伟大的祖国在自己英明领袖毛主席领导之下，正稳步地向前迈进！
    但是，美帝国主义者和其它的战争贩子们，他们所惧怕的就是和平，就是新中国的日益走向幸福、自由和富强的大道，他们千方百计地想来破坏和阻挠我们，他们在安东的两次罪行就是明证。
    我—中国人民解放军的一位战斗英雄——在此严正的警告那些狗都不吃的坏蛋们，如果他们胆敢把侵略的魔手伸进我们祖国美丽的花园里来，妄想偷盗一点什么的话，当心我会斩掉它的狗头！
