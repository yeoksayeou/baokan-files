　　After Watching "Heroes of Lüliang"
    Yu Muying
    The movie "Heroes of Lüliang" is adapted from the novel "Heroes of Lüliang Mountains" by Ma Feng and Xi Rong. The story describes the activities of the militia in the Lüliang Mountains of Northwestern Shanxi during the Anti-Japanese War, and how the Party maintained close ties with the masses. It tells a heroic story of farmers resisting Japan by repelling the frenzied "mopping-up" operations of the Japanese invaders and crushing the conspiracies of the traitorous landlords in an extremely difficult environment.
    "The power of the people is invincible!" This is the theme that "Heroes of Lüliang" wants to express. Here, we can quote what Chairman Mao told us in his book "On Protracted War" in 1938: "The deepest source of the power of war lies in the masses of the people. The reason why Japan dares to bully us is mainly because the Chinese people are unorganized. Overcoming this shortcoming will place the Japanese aggressors before hundreds of millions of Chinese people who have stood up, like a wild bull rushing into a fire formation. A single shout will startle it, and this wild bull will inevitably be burned to death." The victory of the Chinese people's anti-Japanese struggle has already proved this truth.
    Under the leadership of the proletarian party—the Communist Party—through the Party's propaganda, education, and organizational work, the political consciousness of the broad masses of the people is constantly improved, and they are organized on a conscious basis, thus becoming an invincible force.
    "Heroes of Lüliang" not only simply describes the heroism of the peasants in resisting Japan, but also sharply raises and solves problems in the story. For example, Kangjia Village was unable to mobilize when the Eighth Route Army first arrived, the villagers couldn't understand, and even meetings couldn't be held. The masses complained that the militia attracted the Japanese devils to the village... Secretary Lao Ma of the district committee correctly analyzed the problem and pointed out the way to solve it. He said to Zhuzi and others: "The reason why the masses cannot be mobilized at present is because we have not solved problems for the masses. When we can solve problems for the masses, the masses will definitely support us." Later, Lao Ma mobilized the old liberated area masses to support Kangjia Village, and Zhuzi, Erwa, and a group of young militiamen snatched back the farm animals for the villagers. Because the masses felt the Party's concern and help for their vital interests in actual experience, they trusted the Party, and the young people scrambled to become militiamen.
    The playwright grasped the theme idea that "the power of the people is invincible!" and, under this theme, raised and solved the problem of the relationship between the Party and the masses, thus making this film have rich political content, and it has great educational significance for Party cadres and the masses.

　　《吕梁英雄》观后
    于慕英
    电影《吕梁英雄》，是根据马烽、西戎的小说《吕梁英雄传》写成的。故事内容是描述抗日战争中晋西北吕梁山的民兵活动以及党与群众密切联系，在极度艰苦的环境下打退了日寇疯狂的“扫荡”和粉碎了汉奸地主的阴谋伎俩的一段农民抗日的英勇事迹。
    “人民的力量是不可战胜的！”这就是《吕梁英雄》所要表现的主题。在这里，我们可以引用一九三八年毛主席在他的《论持久战》一书中告诉我们的话：“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。日本敢于欺负我们，主要的在于中国民众的无组织状态。克服这一缺点，就把日本侵略者置之于我们数万万站起来了之人民之前，好像一匹野牛冲入火阵，一声唤也要把它吓一大跳，这匹野牛就非烧死不可。”中国人民抗日斗争的胜利，已经证明了这个真理。
    在无产阶级的党—共产党—的领导下，通过党的宣传、教育和组织工作，广大人民的政治觉悟不断提高，并在自觉的基础上组织起来，就成为无敌的力量。
    《吕梁英雄》不仅单纯描述农民抗日的英勇，而且在故事里尖锐地提出问题，解决问题。譬如康家寨在八路军刚到时动不起来，老乡们脑筋打不通，连会也开不成，群众埋怨民兵惹鬼子进村，……。区委书记老马正确分析了问题，并指出解决问题的途径，他向柱子等人说：“眼前群众发动不起来，是因为我们没有替群众解决问题，等到我们能替群众解决问题的时候，群众一定会拥护我们的。”后来老马动员了老区群众支援康家寨，柱子、二娃等一伙青年民兵给老乡们抢回了耕畜，由于群众在实际体验中感到了党对他们切身利益的关心和帮助，因而信任了党，青年们抢着当民兵。
    剧作者把握住“人民的力量是不可战胜的！”这一主题思想，并在这个主题下，提出并解决了党与群众的关系问题，遂使这个影片具有丰富的政治内容，它对于党的干部，对于群众，都有很大的教育作用。
