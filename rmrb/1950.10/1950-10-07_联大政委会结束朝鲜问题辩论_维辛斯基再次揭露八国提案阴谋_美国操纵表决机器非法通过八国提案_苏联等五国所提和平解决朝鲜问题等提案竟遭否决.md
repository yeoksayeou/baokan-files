Xinhua News Agency, 6th Dispatch: A comprehensive dispatch from TASS, New York: The First (Political and Security) Committee of the United Nations General Assembly concluded its four-day debate on the Korean issue on the 4th.

    During the meetings on the 3rd and 4th, representatives from Australia, Canada, the Philippines, Burma, Norway, the United Kingdom, Brazil, and the Netherlands spoke in support of the eight-nation proposal, which attempted to justify further U.S. occupation of Korea.

    Indian representative Rau spoke at the meeting on the 3rd, requesting that the eight-nation proposal of the United Kingdom and others, and the five-nation proposal of the Soviet Union and others, be compromised. He proposed forming a committee to study the two proposals in order to formulate a proposal that could best represent the common ground between the two. Representatives from Israel, Syria, Yugoslavia, and other countries also expressed similar views to India. However, India's proposal was rejected by the majority of the committee.

    Soviet representative Vyshinsky spoke again on the 4th, pointing out that the five-nation proposal of the Soviet Union and others provided a peaceful solution to the Korean War that was in line with the interests of the Korean people, and that the Soviet policy was to strive for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Korea. Vyshinsky once again exposed the conspiracy of the eight-nation proposal, stating that the eight-nation proposal was not for a peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict, but to protect the interests of American monopoly capitalists, and to continue the current American war of aggression in Korea in order to establish colonial rule throughout Korea. The U.S.-British bloc's "majority faction" violated the UN Charter and the basic principles of international law, attempting to use the name of the United Nations to cover up its crimes of expanding aggression. Vyshinsky declared: "The 'majority faction' can do everything in the world, but it cannot turn white into black, or black into white, turn lies into truth, turn evil into good, or turn illegal into legal."

    When voting on the proposals, the eight-nation proposal was passed with 47 votes in favor, 5 votes against. The Soviet Union, Byelorussia, Ukraine, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted against it. India, Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Yemen, and Yugoslavia abstained, and Indonesia did not participate in the vote. Subsequently, the voting machine was continuously activated, rejecting the proposal by the Soviet Union and five other nations for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the Soviet proposal to stop the U.S. Air Force from indiscriminate bombing of peaceful residents and cities in Korea, and the Soviet proposal to dissolve the illegal United Nations Commission on Korea.

　　联大政委会结束朝鲜问题辩论
    维辛斯基再次揭露八国提案阴谋 
    美国操纵表决机器非法通过八国提案
    苏联等五国所提和平解决朝鲜问题等提案竟遭否决
    【新华社六日讯】综合塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会第一（政治及安全）委员会已于四日结束为期四天的朝鲜问题的辩论。
    在三、四两日会议上，澳大利亚、加拿大、菲律宾、缅甸、挪威、英国、巴西、荷兰等国代表发言，支持企图为美国进一步占领朝鲜辩护的八国提案。
    印度代表劳氏在三日会上发言，要求将英国等八国提案和苏联等五国提案加以折衷。他提议组织一委员会，研究这两个提案，以便制订一个能在最大程度上表现两个提案相同之处的提案。以色列、叙利亚、南斯拉夫等国代表亦表示与印度相同的意见。但印度提议为委员会多数所否决。
    苏联代表维辛斯基再度在四日发言，指出苏联等五国提案，为朝鲜战争提供了一个符合朝鲜人民利益的和平解决方案，苏联的政策就是力谋和平解决朝鲜的冲突。维辛斯基又一次揭露八国提案的阴谋称：八国提案不是为了和平解决朝鲜冲突，而是为了保护美国垄断资本家的利益，是要把目前美国侵朝战争继续下去，以图在全朝鲜建立殖民地统治。美英集团“多数派”违反联合国宪章和国际法基本原则，企图用联合国的名义来掩饰其扩大侵略的罪行。维辛斯基宣称：“多数派”可以做尽天下事，但却不能变白为黑，或变黑为白，变谎言为真情，变恶行为善行，变非法为合法。
    在表决各提案时，八国提案以四十七票对五票通过，苏联、白俄罗斯、乌克兰、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克投票反对，印度、埃及、黎巴嫩、沙地阿拉伯、叙利亚、也门和南斯拉夫弃权，印尼未参加投票。接着表决机器连续开动，否决了苏联等五国所提和平解决朝鲜问题的提案，苏联所提制止美国空军滥炸朝鲜和平居民及城市的提案、以及苏联所提解散非法的联合国朝鲜委员会的提案。
