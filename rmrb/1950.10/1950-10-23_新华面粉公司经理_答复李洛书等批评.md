　　Xinhua Flour Company Manager
    Reply to Criticism from Li Luoshu and Others

To the Editor:

    We have read the article "Publicly Operated Xinhua Flour Company Occupies Civilian Land Without Paying Land Price" published in the People's Forum on July 8th. The facts are as follows:

    The Xinhua Flour Company moved to Manzi Village, Anping County, in January 1948. At the time of the move, the land reform in this village had already been vigorously launched. Therefore, the Jizhong Administrative Office instructed the Anping County Government that the land occupied by the company's flour mill should be resolved during the land reform. The Anping County Government immediately conveyed this spirit to the district and village levels and gave the company an official letter agreeing to the administrative office's approach (the company also provided compensation to the farmers for the price of houses and trees). District cadres Liu Qingliang and Bian Jie, who were working on land reform in the village, also explained in detail at the farmers' meeting the county government's official letter and the situation of the flour mill occupying this elm forest for air defense needs. Therefore, during the land reform, these dozen or so households were taken care of. For example, wealthy middle peasants Li Yinhuai and Li Jingming were compensated for the price of their trees, equivalent to 31,230 catties of millet. Furthermore, poor people Li Luoshi and Li Luoqiu received tree compensation equivalent to 22,516.5 catties of millet. In addition, the village gave them four and a half brick houses, three adobe houses, a five-fen building foundation, a four and a half fen vegetable garden, and 1.25 mu of dry land. In reason, these fourteen households should be satisfied with the compensation issue. We believe that the situation reflected by Li Luoshu and others does not match the actual situation.

　　新华面粉公司经理
    答复李洛书等批评编辑同志：
    七月八日人民园地发表的《公营新华面粉公司占用民地不付地价》一文，我们已读到了。现将事实经过说明如下：
    新华面粉公司是一九四八年一月份迁到安平县满子村来的，迁来时这村的土地改革已经轰轰烈烈地展开了，因此冀中行政公署指示安平县府，公司火磨占用地皮，应在土改中解决。安平县府当即将此精神，传达到区村了，并给了公司一个同意行署办法的公函（公司对农民的房、树价格，也给以补偿）。在村作土改工作的区干部刘清亮和边杰同志，并把县政府的公函和火磨为了防空需要占这片榆树林的情况在农民大会上作了详细的说明，因此在土改时对这十几户都有了照顾。如富裕中农李印槐、李景明，偿付他们的树房价款，折合小米三万一千二百三十斤。又如贫民李洛士、李洛丘二人除得树房价款折米两万二千五百一十六斤半以外，村里又给了他们砖房四间半，坯房三间，地基五分，菜园四分五厘，旱地一亩二分五厘。照情理说，这十四户对于补偿问题，应该满意的。我们认为李洛书等所反映的情况与实际情况不符。
