Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th - The joint operation method is already a widespread phenomenon among private industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai. At present, 837 private factories in 20 industries, including cotton spinning, silk weaving, machinery, shipbuilding, and cigarette manufacturing, are participating in joint operations, organized into 38 joint operation groups. After the factories began joint operations, the first thing achieved was a reduction in blind competition among businesses in the same industry in terms of raw material procurement, finished product sales, and production. Competition among private industrial enterprises in Shanghai used to be common and fierce, with phenomena unfavorable to production, such as raw material prices being stimulated by wave-like demand and finished product prices soaring and plummeting due to blind competition. For example, in September of last year, factories in the machinery, shipbuilding, and boiler industries competed to purchase raw materials in the market, causing metal materials to skyrocket, with the price of steel plates in November being ten times higher than in August. After these industries organized joint operations, price fluctuations caused by blind competition were avoided. In terms of production, due to the reduction of blind competition, each joint operation unit has been able to plan production according to sales. For example, the seven cigarette factories participating in joint operations have never experienced product stagnation, and there was almost no moldy tobacco during this year's rainy season.

Secondly, after implementing joint operations, due to the concentration of machinery, equipment, and capital, the quality and specifications of products are consistent, making it easier to accept government entrusted processing orders and loan assistance. More than two-thirds of the above 38 joint operation organizations have processing and ordering contracts with state-owned enterprises, and some have received loan assistance from state banks. For example, the Second Joint Operation Office of the Machinery Industry has a total of 30 small and medium-sized factories. When operating independently, they were unable to accept government orders alone due to limitations in equipment, technology, and the number of workers. After organizing joint operations, they had 450 employees and 378 machine tools, which strengthened their production capacity and allowed them to receive large orders from the Industrial Department of the East China Military and Political Committee.

Participating factories in joint operations have also achieved significant results in saving manpower and material waste and improving product quality. For example, after eight yarn tube factories, including Zhonghua, Chengda, and Qinfeng, implemented joint operations, management costs decreased by more than 20%, and substandard goods decreased by half. Among the 36,000 yarn tubes ordered by Shanghai State-owned No. 1 Cotton Mill from the above factories in August, less than 2% did not meet the original specifications. After the towel and bedsheet industry joint operation organization received a large order from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, due to the mutual cooperation and supervision of the factories, no substandard goods were ever delivered, and the task was often completed ahead of schedule.

The main problems currently existing in joint operations are: some manufacturers organize joint operations solely to win government orders for processing, and therefore fail to seriously improve production operations. For example, after 23 silk weaving factories formed a joint operation, they still retained 23 managers, spending more than 8,000 "folded-unit" per month, and did not pay attention to improving quality. Of the 1,562 bolts of export silk woven on commission in July, as many as 836 were substandard. Some factories, after organizing joint operations, attempted to monopolize orders, control the market, and exclude factories outside the joint operation, forming uncoordinated phenomena between joint operation units and non-joint operation factories. The Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau and the Federation of Industry and Commerce are actively supervising and guiding the improvement of various joint operation units.

　　沪八百余家私营工厂组织联营
    按照销路规定产量，减少盲目竞争现象，生产提高，浪费减少。
    【新华社上海十五日电】联合经营的方式在上海市私营工商业中已是大量存在的现象。目前参加联营的私营工厂有棉纺、丝织、机器、造船、卷烟等二十个行业八百三十七家，联营组织有三十八个。各厂进行联营后，首先减少了同业间在原料采购、成品推销和生产中的盲目竞争现象。上海私营工业相互之间的竞争曾是普遍而剧烈的，经常发生原料价格受波浪式的需求刺激和成品价格因盲目竞争而暴涨暴跌等不利生产的现象。如去年九月间，机器、造船、锅炉等业工厂在市场上竞购原料，致使五金材料暴涨，其中钢板十一月份价格较八月份上涨十倍。各该业组织联营后，避免了因盲目竞争而造成的价格波动。在生产方面，由于减少了盲目竞争，各联营单位均已有计划地按销路规定产量。如参加联营的七家卷烟工厂，产品从未有滞销现象，今年霉季几乎没有霉烟。
    其次，实行联营后，由于机器设备和资力的集中，产品质量规格一致，也便于接受政府的委托加工定货和贷款扶助。上述三十八个联营组织中，三分之二以上与国营企业订有加工定货合同，一部分且得到国家银行的贷款扶助。如机器工业第二联营所共有三十家中小型厂，分散经营时因设备、技术和工人人数等条件的限制，无力单独接受政府定货，组织联营后拥有职工四百五十人，工作母机三百七十八部，这样就加强了生产能力，接到华东军政委员会工业部大批定货。
    参加联营各厂在节省人力物力的浪费和提高产品质量上亦有显著成效。如中华、成大、勤丰等八家纱管工厂实行联营后，管理费用减少百分之二十以上，次货减少一半。八月份上海国营第一棉纺厂向上述工厂定制的三万六千只纱管中，不合原定规格的在百分之二以下。毛巾被单业联营所接到人民解放军某部大批定货后，由于各厂互相配合督促，从未交过次货，且多提前完成任务。
    目前联营中存在的主要问题是：部分厂家单纯为争取政府定货加工而组织联营，因此未能认真改进生产业务。如二十三家丝织厂联营后仍保留二十三个经理，月支八千多折实单位，且不重视改进品质，七月份代织一千五百六十二匹出口绸中，次货竟达八百三十六匹。有些工厂组织联营后企图垄断定货，把持市场，排挤联营以外的厂家，形成联营单位和非联营厂家间不协调的现象。现市人民政府工商局、工商联合会正积极督促、指导各联营单位进行改进中。
