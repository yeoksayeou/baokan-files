Xinhua News Agency, October 29th: The 60th issue of the Chinese edition of the Cominform's newspaper "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" has been published.

The editorial in this issue is entitled "The First Anniversary of the People's Republic of China." The editorial first points out that the Chinese people's unyielding struggle for freedom and national independence and the victory of the People's Great Revolution have great historical significance. After pointing out the achievements of the People's Republic of China in various fields during its first year, the editorial states:

The new China's peaceful policies have won the sympathy and support of all oppressed nations in the East, who have seen in the Chinese revolution an example of how to fight for national liberation. The victory of democratic China has inspired hope and confidence in the hearts of all oppressed people, uniting them in a resolute struggle against imperialist enslavement. The landless peasants of India, the Malayans groaning under the iron heel of British colonialists, the Filipinos who hate the American dictators, and the Vietnamese people who are wielding weapons to drive out foreign invaders have begun to realize more deeply and clearly that the time for their liberation has come, and that they can only achieve liberation through unity in the struggle against imperialism.

The editorial concludes: The American and British imperialists are responding to the surging national liberation movements of the Eastern peoples by launching a devastating and bloody war. They are trying to force the heroic and peace-loving Korean people to their knees through unprecedented atrocities. They are allowing the blood of Korean men, women, and children to flow across the fields. They are shooting Indian peasants who are fighting for land, and hanging Malayans who are merely demanding a free country. They have seized China's Taiwan and are talking wildly about turning it into a huge unsinkable aircraft carrier, hoping to use this aircraft carrier to dominate all of Southeast Asia. They are bombing towns within Northeast China, shamelessly provoking China. They do not treat the Eastern peoples as human beings, and threaten to use even more barbaric means of extermination. They continue to support the butcher Chiang Kai-shek and, defying common sense, refuse to accept the great Chinese people's rightful place in the United Nations organization. But the imperialist gentlemen have miscalculated once again! The situation has fundamentally changed. The era when MacArthur and his ilk could unscrupulously plunder the Eastern peoples is gone forever. The Eastern peoples have learned how to defeat the voracious colonialists, and will deal even more powerful blows in their struggle for complete liberation.

This issue reprints the People's Daily editorial "Now is the Time for the Japanese People to Unite Against the Enemy."

In addition, this issue publishes articles such as "Struggle to Stop the Growth of American Fascist Reactionary Forces" by William Z. Foster, Secretary of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, "The Great Ideological Weapon of Bolshevism" by M. Mitin, a commentary on the 12th anniversary of the publication of the glorious work of Marxism-Leninism, History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course, and "The Brighton Trades Union Congress" by Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain.

　　《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》  中文版第六十期介绍
    【新华社二十九日讯】共产党情报局机关报《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》中文版第六十期已出版。
    该刊本期的社论题为《中华人民共和国的第一周年纪念》。社论首先指出中国人民争取自由与民族独立的百折不挠的斗争和赢得人民大革命的胜利，具有伟大的历史意义。社论在指出了中华人民共和国成立一年来各方面的建树后指出：
    新中国的和平政策赢得了东方一切被压迫民族的同情与拥护，他们从中国革命中看到如何为民族解放而斗争的榜样。民主中国的胜利在一切被压迫人民的心中鼓舞了希望和信心，团结他们从事反对帝国主义奴役的坚决斗争。印度的无地的农民，呻吟在英国殖民者铁蹄下的马来亚人，痛恨美国独裁者的菲律宾人，和手执武器正在驱逐外国侵略者的越南人民开始更深刻地，更明白地认识到他们解放的时机已到，他们在反对帝国主义斗争中只有团结一致才能获得解放。
    社论最后称：美英帝国主义者以发动一次毁灭性的血腥战争，来答复东方各族人民的风起云涌的民族解放运动。他们力图借空前的暴行，迫使英勇的、爱好和平的朝鲜人民屈膝。他们使朝鲜男女老幼的血，流遍了田野。他们正在枪杀为土地而斗争的印度农民，吊死那些只不过是要求一个自由国家的马来亚人。他们霸占了中国的台湾，并侈谈要把它变为一个庞大的不会沉没的航空母舰，借着这个航空母舰，他们希望能统治全部东南亚。他们轰炸东北境内的城镇，厚颜无耻地向中国挑衅。他们不把东方各族人民当作人，并以使用甚至更为野蛮的灭绝手段相威胁。他们继续支持屠夫蒋介石，并且违反常识，拒绝接受伟大的中国人民在联合国机构中占有他们应得的地位。可是帝国主义的老爷们又一次打错了算盘！局势已经根本改观了，麦克阿瑟之流可以肆无忌惮地掠夺东方各族人民的时代已经一去不返了。东方各族人民已经学会了怎样击溃贪婪无度的殖民者，而在他们争取彻底解放的斗争中，将予以更加有力的打击。
    该刊本期转载了中国共产党机关报人民日报的社论《现在是日本人民团结对敌的时候》。
    另外，该刊本期刊登了美国共产党全国委员会书记威廉逊所写的《为阻止美国法西斯反动势力的滋长而斗争》、米丁所作评论马列主义的辉煌著作联共（布）党史简明教程印行十二年的论文《布尔塞维主义的伟大思想武器》及英国共产党总书记波立特所写的《布来屯职工会代表大会》等论文。
