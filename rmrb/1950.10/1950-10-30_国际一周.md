    A Powerful Action to Defend Peace

    On October 20th, at the proposal of the Soviet government, the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania held a meeting in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia. Molotov, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, participated in the meeting. This meeting specifically discussed the unilateral decisions made on the German question at the meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France held in New York in mid-September and issued an important statement.

    The convocation of this eight-nation foreign ministers' meeting is a powerful action by these countries to strive for international peace. It severely hit the sinister attempt of the US imperialist group to use Germany for aggression and adventure in Europe. As everyone knows, the New York meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France, in order to restore German imperialism, decided to take the following concrete steps: (1) Prepare to unilaterally end the state of war against Germany, but still maintain the "occupation regulations" applied to West Germany; (2) Re-examine the decisions on prohibiting and restricting German industry, increase the steel production quota to expand arms production; (3) Allow West Germany to establish mobile police forces, which is actually rebuilding the West German army to serve the imperialist war plan. The US, British, and French foreign ministers' meeting also decided to strengthen the occupation forces of the three countries in West Germany.

    The eight-nation foreign ministers' meeting severely condemned the aggressive policies of the United States, Britain, and France towards Germany. The statement of the eight-nation foreign ministers' meeting exposed the hypocrisy of the so-called "ending the state of war against Germany" and pointed out that restoring West German war industry and establishing a West German army is an attempt by imperialism to freely use West German manpower and resources to realize their aggressive military strategic plan. The statement announced that the governments of the eight countries believe that the unilateral decisions of the New York meeting have no legal effect, and the governments of the United States, Britain, and France should be fully responsible for all illegal actions that attempt to obstruct the German peace treaty and remilitarize West Germany. The statement also put forward a specific plan to solve the German problem, namely: (1) The governments of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union issued a statement declaring that Germany would not be allowed to remilitarize and firmly fulfill the Potsdam Agreement; (2) Abolish restrictions on Germany's peaceful economy and prevent the revival of war potential; (3) Conclude a peace treaty with Germany without delay, and completely withdraw the occupation forces of all countries stationed in Germany one year after the conclusion of the treaty; (4) Establish a pan-German constitutional assembly composed of representatives from East and West Germany on an equal basis to prepare for the establishment of a democratic and peace-loving German interim sovereign government. This statement has won the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of people in European countries who love peace and oppose the revival of German imperialism. German Peace Committee Secretary-General Wellmann has emphasized that this statement will become a program of struggle for German peace. At a time when the imperialist group is expanding its arms race, this statement will mobilize peace-loving people to fight to ensure peace and security in Europe and even the world.

    The statement of the eight-nation foreign ministers' meeting reflects the determination of the people of the world to defend peace. At present, the great movement to defend world peace is further surging. In the United States, by the end of September, the number of peace signatures had soared to 2.5 million. In the United Kingdom, by October 23, 1,133,593 people had signed the peace declaration. In France, the number of peace signatures had reached 12 million as early as August 10. By mid-September, the number of peace signatures in Italy had reached more than 16 million. 20.01 million people throughout Germany have signed. In China, according to statistics as of October 26, 244,489,172 people nationwide have signed the peace declaration. The number of peace signatures worldwide has approached 500 million. During the preparation for the Second World Peace Congress, peace-loving people all over the world have more closely united around the call of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Congress to convene the Second World Congress in Defense of Peace. People from all countries are discussing the tasks of prohibiting atomic weapons, opposing aggression, and maintaining peace proposed by this call, and have elected representatives to attend the Peace Congress. The unprecedentedly powerful gathering of peace forces around the world will powerfully show the world the great truth that peace will inevitably triumph over aggression.

    The Current Situation of the Korean People's Anti-Aggression War

    US imperialism is frantically expanding the war and expanding its aggression on the Korean battlefield. After the US aggressors concentrated all possible land, sea, and air forces that it could mobilize in the Pacific region and landed at Incheon on September 15, it re-occupied important points and lines in southern Korea and directed the Syngman Rhee puppet army to invade north of the 38th parallel first. After the United Nations General Assembly, manipulated by the United States, illegally passed the "Eight-Nation Proposal" to expand the war of aggression against Korea on October 7, the US military and its accomplices, the British and Australian forces, also launched a large-scale invasion northward. Currently, the forces invading north of the Pyongyang-Wonsan line include four US divisions and one regiment (the 1st Cavalry Division, the 1st Marine Division, the 7th Infantry Division, the 24th Infantry Division, and the 187th Regiment of the 11th Airborne Division), one British and Australian combined brigade (the 27th Brigade), and six divisions of the Syngman Rhee puppet army (the 1st, 3rd, 6th, 7th, and 8th Divisions and the Kyoto Division) that have been reorganized. So far, the enemy forces have invaded the line of Bochuan, Unsan, and Heecheon north of Pyongyang on the west coast and the area of Bukcheong north of the 40th parallel on the east coast.

    The young Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Korean People's Army have suffered serious setbacks in the face of powerful enemies, but through persistent and correct struggles, the Korean people can still repel the enemy and turn to counter-offensive, just as the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which had retreated during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, finally repelled the Japanese aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and turned to counter-offensive.

    At present, the Korean people, under the combat call of General Kim Il-sung, are continuing to fight to defend their motherland, eliminate enemy forces, and strive for final victory. On the front lines, the People's Army is conducting heroic resistance, making the enemy pay a heavy price for every city and place they occupy. Behind enemy lines, the Korean people have launched a widespread guerrilla war, attacking and harassing the enemy everywhere. At the same time, the deeper the US aggressors go, the more they are trapped in the quagmire of a long-term war. Under this situation, the Korean people, relying on their own united efforts and the support of the people of the world, will eventually win the final victory in a protracted war.

    We Chinese people are closely watching the dangerous situation of US imperialism expanding its war of aggression throughout the Far East. The secret meeting between war ringleader Truman and MacArthur on Wake Island has decided on steps to expand aggression and take military action throughout Asia. Regardless of the opposition and warnings of the Chinese people, the US aggressors have ordered the US military and the Syngman Rhee puppet army to invade the Sino-Korean border, spreading the flames of the war of aggression to our border. US planes invading Korea are continuing to constantly violate our Northeast airspace. All of this shows that US imperialism's aggression has directly threatened our country's security, which deserves serious vigilance from our people. As Premier Zhou Enlai said, we Chinese people cannot ignore this.

    The Great Victory of the Vietnamese People's Army

    The Vietnamese People's Army recently launched an offensive on the Cao Bang-Lang Son line in northern Vietnam and achieved a great victory. In more than a month of fighting, the Vietnamese People's Army annihilated approximately 10,000 French colonial regular troops and auxiliary forces, and recovered seven important strongholds and cities, including Cao Bang, Dong Khe, That Khe, Na Cham, Dong Dang, Lang Son, and Loc Binh, as well as more than 20 other towns and cities, thereby greatly changing the military situation in northern Vietnam.

    Now, the French army in northern Vietnam has only two isolated strongholds left on the eastern and western lines - Mong Cai and Lao Cai. And these two strongholds are now completely exposed to the attack of the Vietnamese People's Army.

    While achieving great victories in northern Vietnam, the local troops and militias of the People's Army in central and southern Vietnam also launched attacks and removed six French military strongholds in the Red River Delta and central Vietnam after mid-September. The French army in the Quang Binh-Quang Tri-Thua Thien area was also forced to withdraw from many strongholds.

    In this victorious offensive in northern Vietnam, the Vietnamese People's Army first annihilated the enemy's main force. From October 1st to October 9th, the Vietnamese People's Army fought a complete annihilation battle between Cao Bang and That Khe, cleanly and thoroughly eliminating a French force of about 5,500 people who were forced to retreat from Cao Bang and another French force who went north from That Khe to reinforce them, including Colonel Lepage, commander of the two French forces, and Lieutenant Colonel Charton and all the personnel of his headquarters. The remaining French troops in many strongholds in northern Vietnam had no choice but to flee at the sight of the wind. The heroic combat of the Vietnamese People's Army, the close cooperation of the militia and local troops, and the full support of the people of northern Vietnam for the front lines were all important factors in achieving this victory. And the French army's deep intrusion into the country created favorable conditions for the victory of the Vietnamese People's Army.

    This victory proves that the Vietnamese People's Army has grown greatly in the long-term guerrilla warfare, and not only has the strength to conduct large-scale mobile warfare against the French army, but also has the strength to annihilate a large number of the French army's elite troops. This victory also proves that the French colonial army equipped by the United States, no matter how "well" it is equipped, no matter how many points and lines it can temporarily occupy, it will ultimately not escape the fate of destruction. Now, the French government, which is trapped in the Vietnamese quagmire and unable to extricate itself, is begging for US aid. In panic, US imperialism is trying to further intervene in the Vietnamese war and accelerate the shipment of large quantities of weapons to Vietnam. However, the Vietnamese people are prepared for these struggles of imperialism. They will respond to the aggression of imperialism with double the strength. The Vietnamese people are responding to President Ho Chi Minh's call, stepping up preparations for a general counter-offensive, and advancing bravely towards the road to final victory.

    The Struggle within the United Nations

    The development of the struggle in the Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly over the past three weeks is that US imperialism has used the majority it controls to force the Political Committee to illegally pass the so-called eight-nation proposal aimed at authorizing the US aggression against the whole of Korea, and the so-called seven-nation proposal attempting to make the United Nations General Assembly violate the Charter and illegally usurp the powers of the Security Council. The proposals put forward by the Soviet Union and other five countries to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and the many amendments to the seven-nation proposal put forward to defend the United Nations Charter and make the Security Council a truly effective body to maintain peace, have been brazenly rejected by the United States and its voting machine.

    As our Foreign Ministry Spokesperson stated, the US forced the Political and Security Committee to pass the eight-nation proposal on the Korean issue, with the aim of once again stealing the name of the United Nations, expanding the war of aggression against Korea, and attempting to spread the flames of the war of aggression to our border. The US forced the Political Committee to pass the seven-nation proposal called "United Action to Safeguard Peace," which, as Soviet head of delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, Vyshinsky, has repeatedly pointed out, is aimed at destroying the principle of unanimity among the great powers that is the foundation of the United Nations, so that the United Nations General Assembly, which can be manipulated by it to form a majority, can violate the United Nations Charter, exercise the Security Council's power to use armed forces on behalf of it, and cover up its future new aggression.

    Therefore, these two actions by the United States in the United Nations General Assembly are serious steps it is taking to undermine peace and a signal that it is expanding its aggression. But this attempt by the United States has been powerfully exposed within the United Nations by the delegations of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and has been countered by the people of the world outside the United Nations. As its aggressive face is further exposed, the United States is actually becoming more politically isolated.

    The eight-nation proposal to expand the aggression against Korea violates the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries in the United Nations Charter, and is therefore illegal. Moreover, as our Foreign Ministry Spokesperson pointed out: although 46 countries, under US coercion, agreed to the eight-nation proposal to expand the aggression against Korea, the affirmative votes cast by the delegations of these countries not only cannot represent the people of these countries, but even if they could, these 46 countries have a total population of only 660 million, while the five countries headed by the Soviet Union, which oppose this proposal, plus the People's Republic of China, which also firmly opposes this proposal, together represent 722 million people, plus the countries represented by the minimum of seven abstentions (including India) and one reservation on this proposal, then there are 1,196 million people. This simple arithmetic powerfully proves that the eight-nation proposal that was passed by US manipulation cannot fully represent the will of the majority of humanity.

    The Political Committee began deliberating on the Soviet proposal for a "Declaration to Stop the Threat of New Wars and Consolidate World Peace and Security" on the 23rd. The Soviet proposal and the US proposal clearly point out two different routes, the former leading to peace and the latter leading to war. The struggle between these two routes is currently continuing to unfold. This struggle educates and mobilizes the people of the world, unites them under the banner of Soviet peace, strengthens vigilance against the US conspiracy to expand the war of aggression, and actively struggles to defeat this conspiracy.

　　国际一周
    保卫和平的有力行动
    十月二十日，在苏联政府的提议下，苏联、德意志民主共和国、波、捷、匈、罗、保、阿尔巴尼亚等八国，在捷克斯洛伐克首都布拉格举行了外长会议，苏联由部长会议副主席莫洛托夫参加。这一会议专就九月中旬在纽约召开的美、英、法三国外长会议所作的对德国问题的片面决定，进行了讨论，并发表了一项重要声明。
    这次八国外长会议的召开，是这些国家为争取国际和平的有力行动，它严重地打击了美帝国主义集团决心利用德国在欧洲从事侵略冒险的罪恶企图。大家知道，美、英、法三国外长纽约会议为了恢复德帝国主义，曾决定采取如下具体步骤：（一）准备片面结束对德战争状态，但仍保持施行于西德的“占领法规”；（二）重新审查关于禁止与限制德国工业的决定，提高钢的生产限额，以扩大军火生产；（三）允许西德设立机动警察部队，实际上便是重建西德军队，使之服务于帝国主义的战争计划。美英法外长会议并决定增强三国在西德的占领军。
    八国外长会议严厉地斥责了美英法三国对德国的侵略政策。八国外长会议声明揭露所谓“结束对德战争状态”的伪善性质，并指出恢复西德战争工业和建立西德军队，是帝国主义想放手利用西德的人力与物资，以实现它们的侵略性的军事战略计划。声明宣布：八国政府认为纽约会议的片面决定没有法律效力，所有企图阻挠对德和约与使西德重新军事化的非法行动，应由美、英、法三国政府负完全责任。声明同时提出了具体解决德国问题的方案，即：（一）美英法苏四国政府发表声明，宣布不允许德国重新军事化，并坚决履行波茨坦协定；（二）取消对德国和平经济的限制，防止战争潜力的复活；（三）毫不迟延地缔结对德和约，并于和约缔结一年后全部撤退各国驻德国占领军；（四）在平等的基础上成立由德国东、西两部代表组成的全德立宪议会，进行筹备成立民主与爱好和平的德国临时主权政府，这一声明已经赢得了欧洲各国广大爱好和平、反对德帝国主义复活的人民的热烈支持。德国和平委员会总书记卫尔曼已强调表示这一声明将成为争取德国和平的斗争纲领。在帝国主义集团扩大备战之时，这一声明显将动员爱好和平的人民，为确保欧洲以至全世界的和平与安全而斗争。
    八国外长会议的声明，反映了全世界人民保卫和平的决心。目前，保卫世界和平的大运动，正在进一步地高涨着。在美国，到九月底为止，和平签名人数已激增到二百五十万人，在英国，到十月二十三日为止，已有一百十三万三千五百九十三人在和平宣言上签了名。在法国，早在八月十日和平签名人数即已达到一千二百万人。到九月中旬，意大利的和平签名人数已达一千六百万以上。德国全境已有二千零十万人签了名。在中国，截至十月二十六日的统计，全国已有二亿零四百四十八万九千一百七十二人在和平宣言上签了名。全世界和平签名的人数已接近了五亿。在筹备第二届世界和大的工作的期间，全世界爱好和平的人民已更加紧密地团结在和大执行局召开第二届世界拥护和平大会的号召的周围，各国人民都在讨论这一号召所提出的禁止原子武器、反对侵略和维护和平的任务，并且选出了出席和平大会的代表。全世界空前强大的和平力量的大会师，将要有力地向全世界显示和平必然战胜侵略的伟大真理。
    朝鲜人民反侵略战争的现势
    美帝国主义正在朝鲜战场疯狂地扩大战争，扩大侵略。美国侵略者在集中了它在太平洋地区一切可能动员的陆海空军，于九月十五日在仁川登陆以后，它已重行侵占了朝鲜南部的重要点线，并指使李承晚伪军首先向三八线以北进犯。在十月七日为美国所操纵的联合国大会非法通过扩大侵朝战争的“八国提案”之后，美军及其帮凶的英澳军亦行大举北犯。现在向平壤、元山一线以北进犯的共有美军四个师一个团（骑兵第一师，海军陆战队第一师、步兵第七师、步兵第二十四师，空运第十一师第一八七团），英澳联军一个旅（第二十七旅）及重新整补起来的李承晚伪军六个师（第一、三、六、七、八师及京都师）。迄今为止，敌军在西海岸方面已侵犯到平壤以北的博川、云山、熙川之线，在东海岸方面已侵犯到四十度线以北的北青一带。
    年轻的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和朝鲜人民军已经在强大的敌人面前遭受了严重的挫折，但是经过持久的和正确的奋斗，朝鲜人民仍然能够击退敌人而转入反攻，如同曾经在抗日战争和人民解放战争中退却的中国人民解放军终于击退了日本侵略者和蒋介石匪帮而转入反攻一样。
    目前，朝鲜人民在金日成将军的战斗号召下，正继续为保卫祖国、为消灭敌人有生力量、为争取最后胜利而斗争。在前线，人民军进行着英勇的抗击，使敌人每占一城一地，必须付出惨重的代价。在敌人后方，朝鲜人民已发动了广泛的游击战争，到处袭击和驱扰敌人。同时，美国侵略者愈深入，就愈是陷入长期战争的泥沼。在这种形势下，朝鲜人民依靠自身的团结努力和世界人民的支援，终将在持久战中获得最后胜利。
    我们中国人民，正密切注意美帝国主义在整个远东扩大侵略战争的危险形势。战争魁首杜鲁门与麦克阿瑟在威克岛举行的秘密会议，已决定在全亚洲扩大侵略与采取军事行动的步骤。美国侵略者不顾中国人民的反对和警告，已命令美军与李承晚伪军向中朝边界侵犯，将侵略战争的火焰延烧到我国边境来。美国侵略朝鲜的飞机正继续不断地侵犯我东北领空。所有这一切，说明美帝国主义的侵略已经直接威胁着我国的安全，这是值得我国人民严重警惕的。正如周恩来总理所说的，我们中国人民决不能对此置之不理。
    越南人民军的巨大胜利
    越南人民军最近在北越高平至谅山一线发动攻势，获得了巨大的胜利。在一个多月的战斗中，越南人民军歼灭了法国殖民正规军与辅助部队约一万人，光复了高平、东溪、七溪、那岑、同登、谅山和禄平等重要据点与城市七座及其他镇市二十余处，因而大大地改变了越南北部的军事形势。
    现在，法军在北越的东、西两线，只剩下两个孤立的据点——芒街和老开。而这两个据点，目前亦已完全暴露在越南人民军的攻击下。
    与北越取得伟大胜利的同时，中越和南越的人民军地方部队和民兵也发动攻击，于九月中旬以后拔除了红河三角洲与中越南部的法军据点六处。广平——广治——承天地区内的法军，也被迫自很多据点撤退。
    越南人民军在北越的这一胜利攻势中，首先歼灭敌人主力。从十月一日至十月九日，越南人民军在高平与七溪之间，打了一个全胜的歼灭战，干净、彻底地消灭了被迫自高平撤逃的一股法军及自七溪北上增援的另一股法军共约五千五百人，包括该两股法军的司令赖巴西上校及夏尔同中校及其司令部的全体人员在内。北越许多据点中的残余法军，便不得不望风溃逃。越南人民军的英勇作战，民兵和地方部队的密切配合以及越北人民对前线的全力支援，都是获得这一胜利的重要因素。而法军的孤军深入，又给越南人民军的胜利造成了有利的条件。
    这一胜利证明：越南人民军已在长期的游击战争中大大地壮大起来，不仅有力量对法军进行较大规模的运动战，而且有力量大量地歼灭法军的精锐部队。这一胜利又证明：美国装备的法国殖民军，不管它的装备如何“优良”，不管它能暂时地侵占多少点线，但是，它终究逃不出灭亡的命运。现在，陷在越南泥沼中而无法自拔的法国政府，正在乞求美国的援助。美帝国主义在惊慌之余，正图进一步干涉越南战争，并加速以大批武器，运往越南。然而，越南人民对帝国主义的这些挣扎，已有准备。他们将以双倍的力量，回击帝国主义的侵略。越南人民正在响应胡志明主席的号召，加紧准备总反攻，向着最后胜利的道路，勇往前进。
    联合国内的斗争
    过去三周中，在联合国大会政治及安全委员会上进行的斗争，其发展是：美国帝国主义已利用它操纵下的多数，强使政治委员会非法通过了旨在授权美国侵略全部朝鲜的所谓八国提案，与企图使联合国大会违反宪章，非法篡夺安全理事会职权的所谓七国提案。苏联等五国所提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的提案，以及为保卫联合国宪章而使安理会成为真正能维持和平的有效机构而提出的对七国提案的许多修正案，已受到美国及其表决机器的悍然拒绝。
    美国强使政治及安全委员会通过关于朝鲜问题的八国提案，如我国外交部发言人所称：其目的在于再次盗用联合国的名义，扩大侵朝战争，并企图把侵略战争的火焰延烧到我国边界。美国强使政治委员会通过名为“保障和平的联合行动”的七国提案，则如苏联出席联合国大会代表团团长维辛斯基所历次指出的，其目的在于破坏作为联合国基础的大国一致原则，使能为它操纵多数的联合国大会，得以违反联合国宪章，代行安理会使用武装力量的权力，而掩护其今后进行新的侵略。
    因此，美国在联合国大会上的这两项行动，乃是它破坏和平的严重步骤，乃是它扩大侵略的信号。但是美国的这种企图在联合国内受到了苏联与人民民主国家代表团的有力揭露，在联合国外受到了全世界人民的反击。随着其侵略面目之进一步暴露，美国实际上已在政治上更加孤立。
    扩大侵略朝鲜的八国提案是违背联合国宪章不干涉各国内政的原则的，因此是非法的。而且，正如我国外交部发言人所指出：虽然有四十六国在美国胁迫下赞成扩大侵略朝鲜的八国提案，但是这些国家的代表团投的赞成票不但并不能代表这些国家的人民，即使算能代表，这四十六国一共也只有六亿六千万人口，而反对这个提案的，以苏联为首的五国，加上同样坚决反对这一提案的中华人民共和国却一共代表了七亿二千二百万人民，再加上最低限度不赞成这个提案的七张弃权票（包括印度）和一张保留票的代表的国家，则有十一亿九千六百万人口。这个简单的算学有力地证明了为美国操纵通过的八国提案，是完全不能代表大多数人类的意志的。
    政治委员会于二十三日起已开始审议苏联所提“制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全宣言”的提案。苏联的提案与美国的提案明显地指出两条不同的路线，前者引向和平而后者引向战争。这两条路线的斗争目前正继续在展开。这个斗争教育并动员全世界的人民，使他们团结在苏联的和平的旗帜下，加强警惕美国扩大侵略战争的阴谋，并为击败这一阴谋而积极斗争。【新华社二十九日讯】
