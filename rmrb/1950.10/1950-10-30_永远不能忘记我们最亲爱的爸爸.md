Editor's Note: These are written by Comrade Ren Bishi's two daughters in memory of their father. From these two short articles, we can see Comrade Ren Bishi's amiable and approachable nature in daily life and his spirit of hard work and plain living as a revolutionary.

(I)
　　Father: My dearest father, you were only sick for a little over two days, and you have parted with us forever.
　　In July 1946, you and Mom brought my sister and me from Hunan to Yan'an. This was the second time I had seen you. The first time was during the Long March, when I was born and up to one year old. Because you were busy with work, you sent me to Hunan. I didn't know what you looked like then. When I saw you this time, your appearance made me a little scared, but after I lived with you for a while, I felt your kindness and amiability. Every day when my younger brother and I went to the office to call you for dinner, you would always hold our hands and go to dinner together. At that time, you used to send us to bed every night.
　　In 1949, your blood pressure was very high. At that time, you still cared about us the same way. During summer vacation, you would tell my sister about politics every morning, and you often told us to study hard and asked us what we wanted to do when we grew up. I also remember that one day, Mom asked us to take out the clothes we didn't want to make shoes, so I took out a set of slightly smaller gray cloth clothes that our school had given us. When you saw it, you said to me, "You don't want such good clothes?!"
　　After you came back from the Soviet Union for treatment this year, the doctor told you to only work four hours a day, but you exceeded the prescribed time every day, which is the main reason for your death.
　　This year, the house we lived in was relatively small, and it was noisy on the right side. You also wanted to move to a larger house. But when my mother told you that there was a house there, you could live there as long as you repaired it, you were very unwilling. You thought about using public funds to repair it and resolutely dispelled the idea of moving.
　　Now that you are dead, I will never see my kind and loving father again. But all your excellent work style is always flashing in my mind. I want to turn grief into strength, and I must learn your exemplary style and inherit your great revolutionary cause. Father, please rest in peace!
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Your 14-year-old daughter, Yuanzheng

(II)
　　I never thought that I would have such a dear father. It wasn't until January 1, 1950, when he went to Moscow for treatment, that I met him for the first time. At the first meeting, it seemed that there was no deep relationship. He wanted me to return to China with him, but I was not very interested in his proposal. After I lived with him in the hospital for a week, I deeply felt a warmth that I had never received before. Therefore, I resolutely returned to China with my father. Seeing my mother, sister, and younger brother, the family reunited together, and the interest was even stronger.
　　Who knew that I would eventually be a girl without a father. After spending less than ten months with me, he parted with us forever. My tears have run dry, and my heart is about to break. Everything, everything, cannot save my father. I can only comfort my dear mother, study hard, and continue his unfinished business!

　　永远不能忘记我们最亲爱的爸爸
    编者按：这是任弼时同志的两个女儿为纪念她们的爸爸而写的。从这两篇短文里可以看到任弼时同志日常生活中和蔼可亲与艰苦朴素的革命作风。
    （一）
    爸爸：我的最亲爱的爸爸，你只是病了两天多，就和我们永别了。
    在一九四六年七月你和妈妈把我和姐姐从湖南接到延安，这是我第二次见到了你。第一次是在长征中，我生下来到一岁的时候。你们因为工作忙把我送到湖南，那时你是什么样子，我也不知道。当这次我一见到你时，你的面貌使我觉得有些害怕，可是当我和你住过一个时候，我便觉到了你的慈祥和蔼。每天当我和弟弟去办公室叫你吃饭时，你总是拉着我们的手一同去吃饭。那时你每天晚上都送我们去睡觉。
    在一九四九年的时候，你的血压高得很厉害。那时你对我们还是一样的关心。放暑假的时候，你每天早上都给姐姐讲政治，并且常常对我们说要好好学习，问我们长大以后做什么。我还记得在某一天的时候，妈妈叫我们把不要的衣服拿出来做鞋子，我便把我们学校发的一身小一些的灰布衣服拿了出来，你看了便对我说：“这样好的衣服就不要啦？！”
    今年你从苏联治病回来以后，医生叫你每天只做四小时工作，可是你每天都要超过规定的时间，这就是你致死主要的原因。
    今年我们住的房子比较小，右边又吵闹，你也愿搬一个比较大的房子。可是当我妈妈告诉你那里有房子，只要修一下就可以住了，你很不愿意。你想到要用公家的钱修理，坚决地把搬房子的观念打消了。
    现在你已经死了，我再也见不到和蔼慈爱的爸爸了。可是你的一切优良的作风，却时时在我的脑子中闪动着。我要把悲痛变成力量，一定学习你的模范作风，继承着你的伟大的革命事业。爸爸，请你安息吧！
                                  你的十四岁的女儿  远征
    （二）
    我从来没有想到，我还有这样亲爱的爸爸。直到一九五○年一月一日，他到莫斯科养病，我才第一次与他见面。初见面的时候，仿佛没有深切的关系。他要我一同回中国，我对他的提议兴趣不大。我同他在医院住了一星期以后，我深深感觉一种温暖，这是我从来没有领受过的。因此我毅然决然地同爸爸回到了中国。看了妈妈、姊姊、弟弟，一家团聚在一块，兴趣更浓厚了。
    那里知道，我终究是一个没有爸爸的女孩。同我相处不到十个月，他就永别了我们。我的泪儿流尽了，心房欲碎了。一切的一切，无法挽救我的爸爸。我只有安慰我亲爱的母亲，多多努力读书，继续他未完成的事业！
