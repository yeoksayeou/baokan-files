Xinhua News Agency, New York, 1st – The First (Political and Security) Committee of the UN General Assembly began its work on September 30th under the chairmanship of Colombian representative Mr. Abelaez. Belgian representative Langehove was elected Vice-Chairman, and Icelandic representative Thors was elected Rapporteur.

After these organizational matters were resolved, Soviet representative Vyshinsky stated that if the committee was prepared to discuss the agenda, he wished to make a brief statement. He pointed out that the Soviet Union had submitted two documents to the President of the United Nations General Assembly on September 28th - one being letters from the mothers of eleven Greek patriots, and a memorandum concerning the death sentences passed on eight Greek trade union leaders by the Greek government.

Vyshinsky demands a halt to Greek atrocities, the Chairman disregards the rules of procedure and shelves the proposal

Vyshinsky declared that it was clear from these documents that the nineteen Greek patriots had been sentenced to death because of their political beliefs, and that many people in Greece were being sentenced to death, with nearly three thousand currently under sentence of death. According to current materials, in the most recent instance alone, Greek military tribunals sentenced more than fifty representatives of the democratic movement to death, simply because these individuals opposed the anti-popular current government of Greece. Vyshinsky said that the Soviet Union, along with other delegations, had received many letters protesting the reign of terror in Greece. The Soviet delegation appealed to the General Assembly for support in saving the lives of these innocent Greek patriots who had been sentenced to death, and put forward the following proposal:

“The First Committee, noting the continuing death sentences announced by military tribunals in Greece against Greek trade union leaders and leaders of the people’s liberation movement, requests the President of the General Assembly to hold talks with representatives of the Greek government in order to revoke the sentences against the Greek patriots, in particular the sentences against the eleven Greek patriots mentioned in the letter from the mothers of Greek patriots of September 18th, and against the eight trade union leaders mentioned in the memorandum from the relatives of trade union leaders of September 16th.”

Several members of the committee attempted to divert the committee's attention from Vyshinsky's proposal. First, the Greek representative opposed such exposure of the barbaric terrorism of the Greek fascist regime. He opposed the preamble to Vyshinsky's proposal, saying that it was not within the committee's agenda.

Philippine representative Romulo said that the Korean issue had "priority and overriding rights" requiring the committee's attention.

Czechoslovakian representative Siroky strongly supported Vyshinsky's proposal, and he detailed examples of the barbaric terror inflicted by the Greek government on Greek patriots and trade union leaders. He said that the death camps maintained by the Greek government were "something even Hitler himself would have been delighted with".

While Siroky was speaking, the representatives of Bolivia and Chile caused disruption by shouting loudly. Then the chairman announced a recess, and immediately after the short break, Chairman Abelaez put the Philippine proposal to a vote.

Vyshinsky demanded adherence to the procedural rules, but Abelaez insisted that the vote "should not be obstructed". In a vote involving only representatives of the Anglo-American bloc, the chairman announced that the proposal was passed with forty-six votes in favor and no opposition or abstentions.

Vyshinsky lodged a strong protest against the chairman's unjust actions.

Vyshinsky said that the Soviet representative had not participated in the vote because he had not been allowed to comment on the proposal.

Vyshinsky continued: I must insist that we cannot use one issue to push another aside, as the Philippine representative did. The Soviet representative's proposal on Greek acts of terror was not intended to delay consideration of the Korean issue, the rapid consideration and resolution of which is desired by everyone. The Soviet proposal is very urgent, because the executioner's noose of the Greek executioners is being placed around the necks of patriots, and the precedent of the General Assembly makes the Soviet representative believe that the Political Committee is able to take action directly on the proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation without delay and without first submitting the issue to the General Assembly plenary session. Vyshinsky pointed out that the General Assembly spent ten days on general debate, during which the Greek issue was also discussed, but this does not mean that the General Assembly is delaying consideration of the Korean issue. Vyshinsky concluded by saying that he could not but express his surprise at the fact that some representatives had completely lost their composure, causing the chairman to violate the rules of procedure. The chairman did this in response to the strange panicked behavior of some representatives, who were attempting to force the committee to submit to their will.

Polish representative Katz-Suchy pointed out that he had previously requested to speak on a point of order. He said that the Polish delegation had not been given the opportunity to speak on Romulo's proposal. Katz-Suchy requested that the chairman rule that the vote on Romulo's proposal was invalid, because several delegations had been deprived of the opportunity to discuss the proposal.

The representatives of Australia, Mexico, and Chile followed the tactics of the Anglo-American bloc, claiming that the Political Committee had passed Romulo's proposal and should proceed with the items on the agenda.

Katz-Suchy reiterated that the issue raised by Vyshinsky was an urgent issue, and the Political Committee should take action.

After a brief discussion, the committee chairman ruled that the committee had passed Romulo's proposal and therefore should proceed with the discussion of the Korean issue.

The Soviet delegation puts forward a formal proposal to invite representatives from both North and South Korea to participate in the discussion

Vyshinsky declared that since the committee was willing to begin discussing the Korean issue, the Soviet delegation suggested inviting representatives from both North and South Korea to participate in the committee's discussions. Vyshinsky pointed out that the rules of procedure required that the opinions of both sides of the dispute be heard. He also put forward a formal proposal to invite both sides of the dispute to attend the Political Committee meeting.

Kuomintang element Jiang Tingfu opposed inviting representatives from North Korea, and put forward a proposal to invite only representatives from the Syngman Rhee group.

The Ukrainian delegation seconded Vyshinsky's proposal to invite representatives from South Korea as well as North Korea.

Syrian representative El-Khouri also supported the Soviet proposal. The Byelorussian representative eloquently pointed out the necessity of hearing the opinions of the North Koreans.

But U.S. representative Austin opposed hearing both sides and supported the Kuomintang element's proposal.

The Polish representative asked: How can the committee resolve the Korean issue without hearing the opinions of the representatives of the Korean people? He pointed out various precedents for the United Nations to hear both sides of a dispute, rather than just one side. He said that the Democratic People's Government of Korea was established on the basis of elections throughout Korea, and it is the true government of Korea. The representative of the U.S. government, which is conducting military intervention in Korea, has adopted a one-sided and unobjective attitude. He concluded by saying that the Political Committee should invite both sides of the Korean conflict and hear their opinions.

British representative Younger supported the U.S. position.

After a brief discussion of the progress of future work, the committee adjourned to reconvene in the afternoon. At the afternoon meeting of the Political Committee on September 30, the committee continued to discuss the Korean issue. Vyshinsky was the first speaker. Vyshinsky pointed out that the Soviet delegation had proposed inviting representatives from both North and South Korea, and that at this morning's meeting, several representatives had expressed opposition to this proposal. According to the view of the Salvadoran representative, the committee cannot invite representatives from North Korea because the United Nations has not recognized North Korea. When discussing this point, Vyshinsky cited that although the majority of Security Council members have not recognized the People's Republic of China and have only incredibly recognized the Kuomintang group, the Security Council still decided on September 29 to invite representatives from the People's Republic of China.

Vyshinsky said: If the Security Council decides to invite representatives of the Chinese people to attend the discussion of the Taiwan issue, how can the Political Committee refuse to invite representatives of the North Korean government? He said that reasoning like that of El Salvador is unfounded. Vyshinsky recalled that U.S. representative Austin had mentioned that facts must be considered, not fabricated stories. Vyshinsky pointed out that, in fact, North Korea, with a population of over eleven million, is not under the rule of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime. He said that if the Political Committee remembers this fact, then it will be obvious that it cannot deny North Korea the right to participate in the committee's discussion of the Korean issue. Vyshinsky continued, Austin believes that everything has been resolved, and there is nothing more for the committee to discuss on this matter. However, the Soviet delegation believes that the committee must listen to and discuss the United Nations Commission on Korea's report, and discuss various measures to end hostilities and ensure a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Vyshinsky declared that the Political Committee must view this issue as one that needs to be studied.

Regarding the claim that North Korea is the aggressor, Vyshinsky replied that this claim is ineffective and contrary to the facts. Vyshinsky promised to present abundant facts during the discussion of this issue to refute the claim that North Korea is the aggressor.

Austin insisted that North Korea disregarded UN decisions, Vyshinsky replied that the facts are exactly the opposite. The UN majority disregarded North Korea when dealing with the Korean issue. North Korea had already been disregarded when the UN discussed the Korean issue in 1948 and 1949. When the Security Council passed the illegal resolution on Korea on June 25, it did not listen to North Korea's opinions at all, and ignored the proposal to invite them to state their views.

Vyshinsky further said that when the Security Council majority passed the illegal resolution of June 25, it violated the principles of justice. Vyshinsky declared that now Austin is arguing that North Korea disregarded the authority of the United Nations and therefore should not be invited, but in fact the authority of the United Nations is being disregarded by those who violate the principles of the Charter. Vyshinsky said that the Soviet Union believes that the Syngman Rhee group should be held responsible for the aggression, but the Soviet delegation still agrees to listen to the opinions of the Syngman Rhee representative in the same way as it treats the North Korean representative. Those who believe that North Korea should be held responsible for the aggression should also listen to its representative's opinions for the sake of justice. Vyshinsky declared that the United States and Britain have made it clear that they want to forcibly pass a resolution on Korea in the Political Committee, without giving the Political Committee any time to breathe.

Then Vyshinsky turned the topic back to the accusation that North Korea was the "aggressor," and he cited the report of the United Nations Commission on Korea, which clearly proved Syngman Rhee's aggressive acts of interference. Vyshinsky said that all of this indicates that the Syngman Rhee puppet group has long been preparing for a civil war under the protection of the United States, and it is unfair and slanderous to claim that North Korea deliberately launched a fratricidal war.

Vyshinsky asked the representatives of various countries to restrain their unfounded imaginations, to seek a fair solution to this problem, and to avoid one-sided actions that would only worsen the situation. Finally, Vyshinsky strongly advocated inviting representatives from both North and South Korea at the same time.

Czechoslovak representative Hájek supported Vyshinsky's position.

The Soviet suggestion was rejected by the US-UK bloc, and the invitation of only Syngman Rhee's puppet representative was approved.

The chairman then asked Jemison, the reporter of the United Nations so-called Korea Committee, to discuss the report submitted by the committee to the General Assembly.

Jemison's speech generally supported the position of the US interventionists.

After this, British representative Younger spoke, initiating a discussion on a proposal that was clearly instructed by the United States and Britain, but was put forward in the name of eight countries - Australia, Brazil, Cuba, the Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Britain. Younger said that the focus of this proposal is on the "independence and unification" of the region. He pointed out that the proposal recommends the establishment of a United Nations committee to accomplish this goal, "The committee has always asked for freedom of action, but has never enjoyed it before. This time, if our plan is to succeed, the committee must first obtain this freedom."

The next speaker was U.S. representative Austin, who gave a lengthy speech calling for the passage of the proposal put forward by the U.S. bloc. Austin began his speech by attempting to absolve the Syngman Rhee group of responsibility for the Korean War, and to shift the responsibility to the Soviet Union and North Korea. He insisted, "The committee established by the United Nations General Assembly was hindered by the Soviet occupation authorities, preventing it from supervising elections in the northern region, and since then the United Nations has been scorned." Austin praised the aggressive forces in Korea under the command of MacArthur, and continued to attempt to portray North Korea as the aggressor, then he said that it is necessary to "take appropriate steps to eliminate the power and ability of the North Korean aggressors to launch aggression in the future."

Austin then endorsed the proposal put forward in the name of eight countries.

After Austin finished speaking, representatives from Pakistan, Peru, Chile, Cuba, Greece, Venezuela, Syria, France, and Iraq declared their support for the eight-country proposal. Chilean representative Santa Cruz suggested a slight modification of the proposal. This amendment stipulates that the United Nations General Assembly "also recommends that the Economic and Social Council conduct long-term planning research to promote the recovery of Korea."

The Political Committee then adjourned, to reconvene on the morning of October 2.

　　联大政委会九月三十日会议
    苏坚主邀请朝鲜代表陈述意见
    要求挽救无罪而被雅典政权判死的希腊爱国者生命
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约一日电：联大第一（政治及安全）委员会于九月三十日在主席哥伦比亚代表阿彼拉兹主持之下开始其工作。比利时代表郎根霍夫当选为副主席，冰洲代表陶民当选为报告员。
    在这些组织问题解决后，苏联代表维辛斯基即称：假使委员会准备进行讨论议程，他愿意作简单的声明。他指出：苏联于九月二十八日以两项文件交与联合国大会主席——一项是十一位希腊爱国者的母亲们的信件和有关八名希腊工会领袖被希腊政府判处死刑的备忘录。
    维辛斯基要求制止希腊暴行  主席违反议事规则竟予搁置
    维辛斯基宣称：从这些文件中可以看出十九名希腊爱国者的被判死刑乃是因为他们的政治信仰，而且在希腊许多人都被判处死刑，目前被判死刑的近三千人。根据现在的材料，仅在上一次，希腊的军事法庭就把五十多个民主运动的代表判处死刑，仅仅是因为这些人士反对希腊的反人民的现政府。维辛斯基说：苏联与其他代表团接获许多抗议希腊的恐怖统治的信件。苏联代表团向联大呼吁请求声援以挽救这些无罪而被判死刑的希腊爱国者的生命，并提出下列提案。
    “第一委员会注意到目前希腊的军事法庭继续宣布希腊工会领袖和人民解放运动领袖的死刑方面，委员会要求大会主席与希腊政府代表进行谈话，以便撤回对希腊爱国者的判决，特别是对九月十八日希腊爱国者的母亲信中提到的十一位希腊爱国者的判决，和对九月十六日工会领袖们的亲戚的备忘录中提到的八位工会领袖的判决”。
    委员会的若干委员企图转移委员会对维辛斯基的提案的注意。首先是希腊代表反对这样揭露希腊法西斯政权的野蛮的恐怖主义。他反对维辛斯基提案的序言，说这序言不在委员会的议程以内。
    菲律宾代表罗慕洛说：朝鲜问题有要求委员会注意的“优先的和凌驾一切的权利”。
    捷克代表西罗基坚决支持维辛斯基的提案，他详细陈述了希腊政府对希腊爱国者和工会领袖施行的野蛮的恐怖手段的例子。他说：希腊政府所保有的死亡营是“连希特勒自己都会心花怒放的”。
    当西罗基发言时，玻利维亚和智利代表用高声喊叫来造成混乱。接着主席宣布休会，休会片刻后主席阿彼拉兹立即把菲律宾提议提付表决。
    维辛斯基要求遵守议事进程，但阿彼拉兹硬说，“不应当阻碍”表决。在只有英美集团代表参加的表决中，主席宣布：四十六票赞成、无反对或弃权，提议通过。
    维辛斯基对主席的不公正的行动提出强硬抗议。
    维辛斯基说：苏联代表因未获准对该提案提意见，未参加表决。
    维辛斯基继称：我必须坚持，我们不能象菲律宾代表那样利用某一个问题来把另一个问题推到一边。苏联代表提出希腊恐怖行为的提案并不是用来拖延对朝鲜问题的考虑的，朝鲜问题的迅速考虑和解决是每一个人都希望的。苏联的提案是非常迫切的，因为希腊刽子手的绞刑索正套在爱国者的颈上，大会的先例使苏联代表相信政治委员会是能够毫不延迟而且无须先把问题提交大会全体会议，而直接对苏联代表团提出的提案采取行动的。维辛斯基指出：大会花了十天进行一般辩论其中也讨论了希腊问题，但是这并不表示大会在拖延对朝鲜问题的考虑。维辛斯基最后说：他对某些代表完全失去了平静，因而使主席违犯了议事规则这一点，不能不表示惊讶。主席这样作是响应某些代表的奇怪慌乱的行为，他们企图强迫委员会服从他们的意志。
    波兰代表卡茨苏奇指出：他先前曾要求就议事进程问题发言。他说：波兰代表团对于罗慕洛的建议没有得到机会发言。卡茨苏奇请求主席认定，对罗慕洛提议的表决为无效，因为几个国家的代表团都被剥夺了讨论这一建议的机会。
    澳大利亚、墨西哥和智利的代表追随着英美集团的策略，他们声称：政治委员会已经通过了罗慕洛的提议，应该继续进行议程上的议案。
    卡茨苏奇再次申说：维辛斯基所提出的问题是一个迫切的问题，政治委员会应采取行动。
    在稍作讨论后，委员会主席即裁决：委员会已通过罗慕洛的提议案，因此应进行朝鲜问题的讨论。
    苏联代表团提出正式的提案  邀请南北朝鲜代表参加讨论
    维辛斯基宣称：委员会既然愿意开始讨论朝鲜问题，苏联代表团建议邀请南北朝鲜的代表参加委员会的讨论。维辛斯基指出，议事规则要求听取争端的双方陈述意见。他并提出邀请争端双方出席政治委员会会议的正式提案。
    国民党分子蒋廷黻反对邀请北朝鲜的代表，并提出只邀请李承晚集团的代表的提议。
    乌克兰代表团附议维辛斯基关于邀请南朝鲜以及北朝鲜代表的提案。
    叙利亚代表埃尔古里也支持苏联的提案。白俄罗斯代表雄辩地指出听取北朝鲜人陈述意见的必要性。
    但美国代表奥斯汀反对听取双方陈述意见，并支持国民党分子的提议。
    波兰代表问道：委员会不听取朝鲜人民代表陈述意见怎能解决朝鲜问题呢？他指出联合国听取争端的双方，而不是只听取一方陈述意见的各种先例。他说：朝鲜人民的民主政府是在全朝鲜的选举的基础上成立的，它是朝鲜真正的政府。在朝鲜进行军事干涉的美国政府的代表，采取了片面的及不客观的态度。他末了说：政治委员会应邀请朝鲜冲突的双方，并听取他们说明他们的意见。
    英国代表杨格支持美国的立场。
    在稍事讨论了今后工作的进程后，委员会即休会，至下午重开。政治委员会在九月三十日下午会议上，继续进行朝鲜问题的讨论。维辛斯基是第一个发言者。维辛斯基指出，苏联代表团提出邀请南北朝鲜双方代表的提案，而在今晨的会议中，若干代表对这提案表示反对。照萨尔瓦多代表的看法，委员会不能邀请北朝鲜的代表，因为联合国没有承认北朝鲜，在讨论到这一点时，维辛斯基引证说，虽然安理会多数理事国没有承认中华人民共和国而只不可思议地承认国民党集团，但安理会还是在九月二十九日决定了邀请中华人民共和国的代表。
    维辛斯基说：如果安理会决定在讨论台湾问题时邀请中国人民的代表出席，政治委员会怎能拒绝邀请北朝鲜政府的代表呢？他说，象萨尔瓦多那样的推论是没有根据的。维辛斯基追忆说，美国代表奥斯汀曾提到必须考虑事实而不是虚构的故事。维辛斯基指出，然而事实上，有着人口一千一百万余的北朝鲜并不在李承晚傀儡政权的统治下。他说，假如政委会记住这事实，那末不能拒绝北朝鲜参加委员会关于朝鲜问题的讨论的权利，就很明显了。维辛斯基继续说，奥斯汀认为一切都已解决，关于这件事委员会再也没有什么可以讨论的了。但是，苏联代表团认为，委员会须听取并讨论联合国委员会关于朝鲜的报告，并讨论各种措施，以终止敌对状态，并保证朝鲜问题的和平解决。维辛斯基宣称，政委会必须把这问题看作需要加以研究的问题。
    关于硬说北朝鲜是侵略者的说法，维辛斯基答复说，这种说法是没有作用的，与事实相反的。维辛斯基答应在讨论这问题的时候提出丰富的事实，以驳倒说北朝鲜是侵略者的言论。
    奥斯汀硬说北朝鲜漠视联合国决定，维辛斯基答复他说，事实恰好相反。联合国的多数在处理朝鲜问题时，漠视了北朝鲜。在一九四八和一九四九年联合国讨论朝鲜问题时，北朝鲜就已经被漠视。安理会在六月二十五日通过关于朝鲜的非法决定时，根本就没有听取北朝鲜的意见，并且对邀请他们陈述意见的建议置之不理。
    维辛斯基更进一步说，当安理会多数通过六月二十五日的非法决议时，就违反了公正的原则。维辛斯基宣称，现在奥斯汀反而争辩说北朝鲜漠视了联合国的权威，因此不应邀请，事实上联合国的权威是被那些违反宪章原则的人所漠视了。维辛斯基说，苏联认为李承晚集团应负侵略的责任，然而苏联代表团仍然赞成和对待北朝鲜代表一样，同样听取李承晚代表的意见。那些认为北朝鲜应负侵略责任的人，也为了公正起见也应听取它的代表的意见。维辛斯基宣称，美国和英国明白表示他们想要在政委会强力通过关于朝鲜的决议，不让政委会有一点喘息的时间。
    接着维辛斯基把话题再次转到指责北朝鲜是“侵略者”的说法上，他引证联合国朝鲜委员会的报告，明显地证明了李承晚的侵略干涉行为。维辛斯基说，这一切都表示李承晚傀儡集团长期以来就在美国的保护下准备内战，硬说北朝鲜蓄意发动同族相残的战争是不公平而且诽谤的。
    维辛斯基要求各国代表约束一下凭空臆测的想象力，来寻求这问题的公正解决办法，避免只会使局势更为恶化的片面行动。最后，维辛斯基竭力主张同时邀请南北朝鲜双方的代表。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表哈奇杜支持维辛斯基的立场。
    苏联建议竟遭美英集团否决  通过只邀请李承晚傀儡代表
    主席至此要求对苏联的建议进行表决。建议被四十六张反对票否决，赞成者有六票——苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和南斯拉夫。七国代表弃权。政委会接着通过了国民党分子的建议——只邀请南朝鲜代表出席。
    主席至此召联合国所谓朝鲜委员会的报告人杰米逊论述该委员会向大会提出的报告。
    杰米逊的发言一般说来是支持美国干涉者的立场。
    此后，英代表杨格发言，展开了对一项提案的讨论，这一项提案显然是由美国和英国授意的，然而却以八个国家的名义提出——这些国家是澳大利亚、巴西、古巴、荷兰、挪威、巴基斯坦、菲律宾和英国。杨格说，这个提案的重点是放在该地区的“独立和统一”。他指出，提案建议成立一个联合国委员会来完成这个目的，“委员会一直都要求有行动的自由，但以前从来不会享有过，这一次我们的计划要想成功，首先须委员会取得这种自由。”
    下一个发言者是美国代表奥斯汀，他发表了冗长的演说，要求通过美国集团提出的提案。奥斯汀一开始演说便企图为李承晚集团卸除朝鲜战争的责任，并想把责任推到苏联和北朝鲜身上。他硬说，“联合国大会成立的委员会被苏联占领当局阻难，不让它去监督北部地区的选举，从那时起联合国就被藐视了。”奥斯汀赞扬麦克阿瑟指挥下的在朝鲜的侵略军队，并继续企图把北朝鲜说成侵略者，接着他说，必须“采取适当的步骤，以消灭北朝鲜侵略者在未来发动侵略的力量和能力。”
    奥斯汀至此赞成以八国名义提出的提案。
    在奥斯汀发言完毕之后，巴基斯坦、秘鲁、智利、古巴、希腊、委内瑞拉、叙利亚、法国和伊拉克等国的代表宣称支持八国提案。智利代表圣大克鲁兹建议把提案略加以修改。这一修正案规定，联合国大会“也建议经社理事会进行长远打算的研究，以促进朝鲜的恢复。”
    政治委员会至此宣告休会，至十月二日早晨重开。
