　　Brave and Confident, Determined to Win the Battle for Peace
    Li Da
    To defend world peace and oppose wars of aggression is the historical task of all peace-loving and justice-upholding people in the world. This is the guiding principle for revolutionaries' actions. But we are absolutely not like pacifists, merely moaning in the call for peace, or indiscriminately opposing war. We must fight with courageous practical actions to strive for peace; oppose wars of aggression, and at the same time support just wars to obtain true peace.

    In the past year, China's movement to defend world peace has consistently unfolded based on this clear task, combined with the international situation. The nationwide peace signature campaign has reached over one hundred million people; at the same time, the people of the whole country, in view of the series of aggressive acts by American imperialism in Korea and Taiwan, can raise their vigilance with sufficient understanding. If the "dirty pig snout breaks into our beautiful vegetable garden," we will use abundant force to give a fatal blow, head and snout included.

    Imperialists are originally vampires, using airplanes, cannons, and atomic bombs to massacre the people of the world. They extract gold from flesh and blood to increase profit figures, in order to prolong their feeble existence. But in fact, the grave they are digging for themselves has already been dug, and is waiting for the peace forces of the world to bury them.

    People of the world, unite and wage an uninterrupted struggle to defend world peace! And be brave and confident, determined to win the battle for peace!

　　勇敢自信，决心打胜争取和平的战斗
    李达
    保卫世界和平，反对侵略战争，这是全世界一切爱好和平主持正义的人们的历史任务。这是革命者行动的指标。但我们绝不像和平主义者，仅仅是呻吟于和平的呼唤，或无区别的反对战争。我们要以英勇的实际行动为争取和平而斗争；反对侵略战争，同时又支持为获得真正和平而奋斗的正义战争。
    一年来中国保卫世界和平运动，始终是根据这一明确任务，结合国际形势而展开的。全国普遍的和平答名运动，已达一亿以上的数字；同时全国人民鉴于美帝在朝鲜台湾一系列的侵略行为，都能以足够的认识、提高警惕。倘如“肮脏的猪嘴闯进我们美丽的菜园”，便以充沛的武力，连头带嘴，给予致命的痛击。
    帝国主义者原是吸血鬼，利用飞机大炮原子弹屠杀全世界人民。从血肉中提炼黄金，增加利润的数字，以图苟延残喘。但事实上其自掘的坟墓，已经掘好，正等待着全世界和平力量来葬埋。
    全世界人民团结起来，为保卫世界和平而进行无间歇地斗争。并且要勇敢自信，决心打胜争取和平的战斗！
