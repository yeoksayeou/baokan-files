　　"Tell Me, Am I Happy or Not?"
    ——A Visit with Xinjiang Farmers
    Ding Ni

　　One day in September, I went from Dihua to the Agricultural and Forestry Experimental Station in Changji County on business. Many villagers were busy threshing grain. I found a few relatively free villagers to chat with. They all spoke unanimously about their new life after emancipation, while also recalling their past miserable experiences.

　　An old man surnamed Han said, "I have lived here for decades. For decades, the people here have been living in suffering. In the twelfth lunar month, the poor could only pick up broken coal cinders and huddle in dilapidated kilns, suffering! When they ran out of food, they would put the clothes of several people on one person and go out to beg for food, bringing it back for everyone to eat. When the People's Liberation Army came, the world became peaceful, and everyone was friendly to each other. Poor families no longer suffer the grievances of the past! Don't think that I am already sixty-eight years old, when it comes to labor, I still have a lot of strength!"

　　Speaking of the People's Liberation Army, an old man surnamed Ma recalled the misfortunes his son suffered under the rule of the Kuomintang bandits. He interjected, "The year before last, the 'Kuomintang' wanted conscripts, and they took my son away. At first, they said he was hired, but later they insisted that my son was a 'volunteer soldier.' After that, my son couldn't even send me a letter. But a few days ago, he wrote to me. It was written to me personally by their regimental commander. The letter said that he is now working in the People's Liberation Army and is much better off than before. That regimental commander even asked me to visit them there. Tell me, am I happy or not?" Old Man He continued, "Now, the comrades of the People's Liberation Army are just like family to us! Not only do they borrow and return things, but they also help poor families who cannot afford to hire laborers to harvest wheat and dig potatoes!"

　　When I mentioned the grain tax, Old Man Ma said, "At that time, the rich and the town and village chiefs were hand in glove. When the grain requisition orders came down, they would all push them onto the poor. Even if you were about to starve to death, you still had to give them grain. They had the knives in their hands! They would bring those beastly troops at the slightest provocation! This time, the Communist Party came, and these deceiving things are gone. Not to mention anything else, the People's Government buys grain from us, and they investigate clearly to see if you really have surplus grain before discussing it with you. Such a thing, I had never even heard of it in the past, let alone seen it!" Finally, he smiled and said, "What do you say, comrade! In the past, we poor people didn't even weigh four ounces with our hair, but now we weigh a full pound!"

　　“你说，我高兴不高兴？”
    ——新疆农民访问记
    丁尼
    九月的某一天，我因事从迪化到昌吉县的农林试验常许多老乡们正忙着打场。我找了几个比较空闲的老乡闲谈起来。他们都不约而同地谈起了翻身后的新生活，同时又回想了他们过去的悲惨遭遇。
    一个姓韩的老汉说：“我生活在这里已经有几十年啦。几十年来，这里的老百姓一直生活在苦难中，到了腊月天，穷人们只能检点碎煤碴，挤在破瓦窑里熬煎着！断粮了，就把几个人的衣服给一个人穿上，出去讨饭，讨回来给大家吃。咱解放军一来，天下就太平了，谁见谁都是和和气气的。穷人家再也不受过去那些气啦！你不要以为我已经六十八岁了，讲劳动，我可还有劲的很哩！”
    谈到解放军，一个姓马的老乡又想起了他儿子在国民党匪帮统治下所遭到的不幸来了。他插嘴说：“前年‘刮民党’要壮丁，他们把我的儿子给弄去了。开头说是雇的，后来硬说我儿子是‘自愿兵’，以后我儿连个信都不能给我了。可是前几天他来信了，是他们团长亲自写给我的。信上说，他这会在解放军工作，比过去好多啦。那个团长还叫我上他们那里看看去。你说我高兴不高兴？”何老汉接着说：“这会儿解放军的同志们，和咱活像一家人！不但借东西有借有还，还给雇不起工的穷户人家帮助割麦子，挖洋芋哩！”
    当我一提起缴粮的事，马老汉说：“那会儿有钱人和镇乡长是一个鼻孔出气。粮条一下来，他们都给弄到穷人头上，那怕你快饿死，也得给人家出粮。刀把子在人家手里呀！他们动不动就把那些畜牲军队领来！这回共产党来啦，这些欺人的事情就没有了。不说别的，人民政府向咱们买粮，还要调查的清清楚楚，看你确实有多余的粮食，才和你商量着办。这样的事，过去连听都没有听说过，更不用说见过了！”最后，他笑了一笑说：“你说是吗？同志！过去咱穷人连毛也没有四两重，这会儿可足足的够一斤啦！”
