　　Severely Punish Landlords Who Counterattack, Discipline Neglectful Judicial Personnel
　　Letter from Comrade Hao Zhixin

To the Editor:

　　After reading the article "Landlord Counterattack Kills Revolutionary Cadre, Village Cadres Assist, Special District and County Handle Carelessly" published in the People's Forum on October 14th, in addition to hating the counterattacking landlords, I also have some opinions regarding those irresponsible people's judicial workers.

　　The incidents of landlords counterattacking peasants have happened more than once. As previously mentioned in the People's Forum, the landlord Hao Wubao of Guanzhuang Village, Third District, Lingshou County, Hebei Province, counterattacked peasants, beat military dependents, and drove two old people out of the houses they had been allocated.

　　Some judicial personnel have adopted a frivolous attitude towards such major cases as landlords counterattacking and killing revolutionary cadres, which is intolerable. The Shijiazhuang Special District Court and the Zhengding County Government Judicial Section, in handling this case, disregarded the interests of the masses and wronged the victimized cadre's family members, thus damaging the people's government's prestige among the masses. For example, Xie Youfen, the head of the Zhengding County Judicial Section, said to Kang Zhenjiang, the family member of the victim: "The dead are already dead, bury them quickly. Pay attention not to waste, report expenses truthfully, and overspending will not be reimbursed and will be punished." Also, a cadre from the Shijiazhuang Special District Court said to the village chief's family member: "Agreed, right! This is how we have ruled; if you disagree, fine, you can appeal to Beijing." Their words show that they have lost the spirit of serving the people. Therefore, I suggest to the government: in order to safeguard the laws and disciplines of the people's government, the criminals Fang Luoyu and Fang Heigou should be promptly punished according to law, and the cadres who disregard the interests of the masses should also be appropriately punished.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　郝志信

### 严办反攻的地主惩戒失职司法人员  郝志信同志来信

　　严办反攻的地主惩戒失职司法人员
    郝志信同志来信编辑同志：
    我读了十月十四日人民园地发表的《地主反攻杀害革命干部，村干帮凶专县马虎了事》一文后，除了痛恨反攻的地主外，对于那些失责的人民司法工作者，也有一些意见。
    地主向农民反攻的事件，已不止一次了。如前人民园地所载河北灵寿县三区官庄村地主郝五保向农民反攻，殴打军属，并把两个老人从分得的房子里赶了出来，就是一个例子。
    对地主反攻、杀害革命干部这样重大的案件，某些司法人员竟采取轻率的态度，这是令人难以容忍的。石家庄专区法院和正定县府司法科在处理此案时，漠视群众利益，冤屈被害干部家属，因而使人民政府在群众中的威信受到损失。如正定县司法科长谢友芬对被害家属康振江说：“死了的已经死了，赶紧埋了吧。注意不要浪费，实报实销，超过报不了账，要受处分的。”又如石家庄专区法院干部向村长家属说：“同意了吧！我们就是这样判决了；你们如不同意，好，还可以到北京上诉。”他们这些话，说明了他们已失去了为人民服务的精神。因此，我向政府建议：为了维护人民政府的法纪，凶犯房洛雨、房黑狗应迅速依法予以惩办，对漠视群众利益的干部，亦应予以适当处分。
