　　Xinhua News Agency, Karachi (TASS dispatch), October 7th: The "Pakistan Times" recently published a photograph of American soldiers cruelly mistreating Korean prisoners of war. The photograph shows a group of American soldiers – "aggressors" – stripping the escorted prisoners naked. The newspaper's editorial department has begun to receive letters full of indignation from readers who have seen the photograph. Bavise, a resident of Lahore, wrote in a letter: "I want to appeal to the men, women, and children of our country. I urge everyone to resolutely condemn the crimes and atrocities committed by the Americans in Korea. The people of Asian countries must be thoroughly aware that American fascism, using empty talk of 'democracy' as a smokescreen, is no different from the fascism of Hitler and Mussolini."

　　美军在朝暴行令人切齿
    巴基斯坦人民痛予斥责
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社喀喇蚩讯：《巴基斯坦时报》最近刊载了一幅美军士兵残酷虐待朝鲜俘虏的照片。照片显示一批美军士兵——“侵略者”，把押解的俘虏弄得一丝不挂。该报编辑部已开始收到看过这幅照片的读者们充满愤慨的来信。拉合尔的居民巴维斯在信中写道：“我要向我国的男女老幼呼吁。我敦促每一个人坚决地斥责美国人在朝鲜所犯的罪恶和暴行。亚洲各国人民必须彻底觉悟，用‘民主’的空谈做烟幕的美国法西斯主义，与希特勒及墨索里尼的法西斯主义毫无区别。”
