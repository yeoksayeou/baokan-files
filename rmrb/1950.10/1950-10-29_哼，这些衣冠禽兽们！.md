　　Hmph, these beasts in human clothing!
　　Zhang Zhi
　　This morning (October 27th), I saw an abstract of Truman's speech at the United Nations Special Assembly in the People's Daily. What "universal morality," what "noble ideals," what "goals of peace and justice," it had everything. I just felt waves of nausea, like I was going to vomit.
　　Tonight, I saw the Korean documentary "A Message to All People of Conscience in the World" at the People's Daily office. Under the insane slaughter and bombing by American imperialism and its running dog Syngman Rhee gang, beautiful Korea has become a living hell. Everywhere are broken walls and rubble, everywhere are seas of blood and mountains of corpses. The mangled corpses of old people, middle-aged people, young people, children and infants are scattered in a chaotic pile on the smoke-filled ruins, many of the corpses with their hands and feet bound with thick ropes. American imperialist planes circle in the sky, inflicting abuse, and homes, hospitals, churches, and schools are all reduced to ashes in the raging flames. Under the direct supervision of American executioners, Syngman Rhee's lackeys aim American rifles at the Korean patriotic people who are tied to wooden stakes. Speaking of hatred, is there any hatred greater than the hatred of the Korean people (and it should be said, the people of the whole world) for American imperialism? Speaking of conscience, now is the time for the people of the world to arouse their conscience! Look, this is the concrete manifestation of what the beasts in human clothing like Truman call "universal morality," "noble ideals," and "goals of peace and justice"!
　　I have not been to Korea, but a year ago I visited the Korean life photo exhibition in Beijing. The new life in North Korea after liberation left me with an indelible impression. The grand scale of the machine factories and textile mills, the smiles of the men and women workers pouring out of the factory gates; the towering buildings of Kim Il-sung University, the selfless expressions of the graduate students engaged in research; kindergartens and nurseries full of the happiness of new life, joyful pictures of little angels eating and playing together. ... While in South Korea, which has not yet been liberated, under the iron heel of American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee gang, I saw bloody scenes of the police collectively massacring patriotic people, saw starving crowds with haggard faces sleeping in the streets, and saw sad-faced old farmers sighing in the fields. From the comparison between North and South Korea, I saw my own country—the old China before liberation and the new China after liberation. I saw concretely the road of human historical development.
　　Today, American imperialism actually wants to use planes and artillery to suppress the development of history, to suppress the new life of the Korean people and the people of all Asia and the world. This is the essence of the wild ambition of American imperialism. This explains why American imperialism wants to collect and aid the political garbage of the world—Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, Bao Dai, Quirino, Adenauer, Franco, and the like; why, after suffering a disastrous defeat in using six billion US dollars to aid the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's attack on the Chinese people, it directly occupied our Taiwan; why it instigated the Syngman Rhee bandit gang to launch the Korean civil war; why it "ordered the American and British troops to advance towards the Sino-Korean border with any necessary force," why it bombed and strafed our Northeast again and again; why it used a large number of bombers and landing craft to aid the remnant French troops who suffered a disastrous defeat in invading Vietnam; why it signed aggressive agreements with Burma and Indonesia; why it is arming Japan and West Germany; why it wants to build its "defense line" on the territory of other countries tens of thousands of miles away.
　　Let the beasts in human clothing of the American aggressive bloc rave about "strategy" and "defense lines," let them clamor about the imperialist "universal morality," "noble ideals," and "goals of peace and justice," we only know how to oppose aggression, only know how to defend the peace and security of the motherland and the world, only know how to tear up the clothes of the beasts in human clothing, to smash their biting, bloody fangs, so that we can quietly build our country and create freedom and happiness for future generations.

　　哼，这些衣冠禽兽们！
    章直
    今天（十月二十七日）早晨，我在人民日报上看到杜鲁门在联合国特别大会上发表的演词的摘要。什么“普遍道德”呀，“高尚理想”呀，“和平和正义的目标”呀，应有尽有。我只觉得一阵阵恶心，要呕吐了。
    今天晚上，我在人民日报社看到朝鲜纪录片《告全世界有良心的人们》。在美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚匪帮的疯狂屠杀和轰炸下，美丽的朝鲜已变成人间地狱了。到处是残垣碎瓦，到处是血海尸山。老年人、中年人、少年人、以及儿童和婴孩们的血肉模糊的尸体，纵横狼藉地堆积在冒着浓烟的废墟上，有许多尸体的手脚都捆缚着粗绳子。美帝飞机在天空盘旋、施虐，住宅、医院、教堂、学校都在融融的烈焰中化为灰烬。在美国刽子手们的直接监视下，李承晚的爪牙们端着美国步枪向被捆绑在木桩上的朝鲜爱国人民瞄准。说仇恨，难道还有什么仇恨胜过朝鲜人民（应该说全世界人民）对美帝国主义的仇恨吗？说良心，这应该是全世界人民激发良心的时候了！看吧，这就是杜鲁门一流的衣冠禽兽们所谓“普遍道德”、“高尚理想”、“和平和正义的目标”的具体表现！
    我没有到过朝鲜，但我一年前在北京参观过朝鲜生活照片展览。解放后的北朝鲜的新生活给我永远不能磨灭的印像。规模宏大的机器厂和纺织厂，涌出工厂大门的男女工人的笑容；金日成大学的巍峨大厦，正在进行研究工作的研究生们的忘我的表情；充满新生的幸福的幼稚园和托儿所，小天使们集体吃饭和游戏的欢乐图。……而在尚未解放的南朝鲜，在美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮的铁蹄下，我看见警察集体屠杀爱国人民的血腥场面，看见鸠形鹄面的饥饿人群露宿在街头，看见愁眉苦脸的老农在田间唉声叹气。我从南北朝鲜的对比中看见了自己的祖国——解放前的旧中国和解放后的新中国。我具体看见了人类历史发展的道路。
    今天，美帝国主义竟想用飞机大炮来压阻历史的发展，压阻朝鲜人民以及全亚洲、全世界人民的新生。这就是美帝国主义的狂妄野心的本质。这说明了美帝国主义为什么要收集和援助全世界的政治垃圾蒋介石、李承晚、保大、季里诺、阿登纳、弗朗哥之流；为什么在用六十亿美元援助蒋介石匪帮进攻中国人民而遭受惨败之后，又直接侵占我们的台湾；为什么要嗾使李承晚匪帮发动朝鲜的内战；为什么要“命令美英两国军队以任何必需兵力向中朝边境推进”，为什么要至再至三地轰炸扫射我们的东北；为什么要用大批轰炸机和登陆艇援助侵略越南而遭受惨败的残余法军；为什么要与缅甸印尼签订侵略性协定；为什么要武装日本和西德；为什么要把自己的“国防线”建立在万里迢迢的别国的国境上。
    让美国侵略集团的衣冠禽兽们去狂吠“战略”和“防线”吧，让它们叫嚣帝国主义的“普遍道德”、“高尚理想”、“和平和正义的目标”吧，我们只知道反侵略，只知道保卫祖国和世界的和平和安全，只知道撕毁衣冠禽兽们的衣冠，打碎其咬人的血腥的毒牙，使我们能够安安静静地建设我们的国家，为子孙后代创造自由和幸福。
