Shihchingshan Iron and Steel Plant Continuously Achieved New Records in Last Month's Production Competition
　　All Employees Wrote a Letter to Report to Chairman Mao
[Our Newspaper] To welcome and celebrate the first National Day and to congratulate the convocation of the National Conference of Model Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, all employees of Shihchingshan Iron and Steel Plant have doubled their efforts in the production competition since the beginning of September, and many new records have been continuously achieved. For example, on September 22, the pig iron output created an unprecedented record of exceeding the highest record of increased production during the "May Day" period this year by 8.3%. All employees of the plant wrote to Chairman Mao to report their production achievements and guaranteed to consolidate the new records in production and continue to work hard to increase production. The original letter is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
　　We, all employees of Shihchingshan Iron and Steel Plant, would like to report our production achievements to you with the most joyful mood.
　　Since June this year, our plant has launched a four-month continuous new record competition. In these four months, thanks to the implementation of your wise instructions, we have overfulfilled the task in production. In the rationalization proposal alone, we have received 160 proposals so far, of which 40 have been adopted, and the total savings value of the 11 proposals that have been rewarded is more than 986,000 catties of millet. At the same time, a large number of labor models have emerged. Comrade Li Jinquan, who attended the National Conference of Labor Model Representatives from our plant, is one of the representatives of these labor models.
　　Since September, in order to welcome and celebrate the first anniversary of the founding of our motherland, and to celebrate the convocation of the National Conference of Combat Heroes and Labor Model Representatives, with the doubled efforts of all our employees, many new records have been continuously achieved.
　　On September 22, the pig iron output created an unprecedented new record, exceeding the new record of the "May Day" increased production campaign this year by 8.3%. Since September, all pig iron quality has met the specifications, and special grade and No. 1 and No. 2 foundry iron accounted for more than 96%.
　　Since September, the average ash content of metallurgical coke has been reduced to 14.85%, which is 2.25% lower than the administrative ash content standard, and the coke strength has increased from 76.2% to 83.33% (August). Moreover, the experiment of mixing pulverized coal (waste) to replace Kailuan's special end coal for coking was successful, saving 38,640 catties of millet per day. The existing pulverized coal is enough for one month of mixing.
　　The average output of cast pipes exceeded the task by 20%, the average yield of finished cast iron straight pipes was 93%, exceeding the administrative task by 3%, and the yield of finished cast iron pipe fittings was increased to 99.3%.
　　The power plant has only experienced one local minor accident in four months.
　　The number of accidents in transportation has been reduced by half in the past four months.
　　Since September, the yield of finished products in the foundry of the repair department has been 100%.
　　In terms of basic construction projects, we are confident that we will complete the overhaul project of the No. 2 blast furnace one and a half months ahead of schedule in November.
　　Finally, we will definitely respond to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, learn from the national combat heroes and labor model representatives, and under your leadership and the leadership of the Central People's Government, continue to work hard to consolidate the new records in production and strive for the industrialization of the motherland and the strengthening of the national defense of the new China. Any adventurous and provocative behavior of imperialism cannot shake our firm determination!
　　Chairman Mao, we dare to guarantee you this. We wish you good health!
　　All employees of Shihchingshan Iron and Steel Plant
September 30

　　石景山钢铁厂上月生产竞赛中
    连续出现新纪录
    全体职工写信报告毛主席
    【本报讯】石景山钢铁厂全体职工为迎接与庆祝第一个国庆日及庆贺全国工农兵劳模会议的召开，九月初以来，在生产竞赛中加倍努力，连续出现了不少新纪录。如九月二十二日生铁产量创造了超过今年“五一”增产最高纪录的百分之八·三的空前纪录，该厂全体职工上书毛主席报告生产成绩，并保证巩固生产上的新纪录，继续努力增产。原信如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    我们石景山钢铁厂全体职工，谨以最愉快的心情，向您报告我们的生产成绩。
    从今年六月起，我厂展开了连续四个月的新纪录竞赛运动。在这四个月中，由于执行了您的英明指示，在生产上已超额完成了任务。仅合理化建议一项，到目前已收到一百六十件，共采纳四十件，已奖励的十一件的总节约价值即为九十八万六千多斤小米。同时并涌现了大批劳动模范，我厂出席全国劳模代表会议的李金泉同志，就是这些劳动模范的代表之一。
    九月以来，为了迎接和庆贺我们的祖国成立一周年纪念日，和庆祝全国战斗英雄和劳动模范代表会议的召开，在我们全体职工的加倍努力之下，又连续出现了不少新纪录。
    生铁产量在九月二十二日那一天，创造了超过今年“五一”增产运动新纪录百分之八·三的空前更新纪录。生铁质量九月以来全部合乎规格，特号和一、二号翻砂铁占百分之九十六以上。
    冶金焦自九月以来，灰分平均降低至百分之一四·八五，比行政要求灰分标准降低百分之二·二五，焦炭强度由百分之七六·二增加到百分之八三·三三（八月份）。并且试验掺和粉煤（废料）代替开滦特特末炼焦得到成功，每天可节省小米三万八千六百四十斤，现有粉煤够一个月掺用。
    铸管产量平均超过任务百分之二十，铸铁直管成品率平均百分之九十三，超过行政任务百分之三，铸铁管件成品率提高到百分之九九·三。
    发电四个月中仅仅出过一次局部小事故。
    运输四个月来，事故较前减少了一半。
    修理部翻砂场九月以来成品率全部百分之百。
    在基本建设工程方面，我们有信心在十一月中提前一个半月完成二高炉抢修工程。
    最后，我们一定响应中共中央的号召，向全国战斗英雄和劳动模范代表们学习，并在您和中央人民政府的领导下，继续努力，巩固生产上的新纪录，为祖国的工业化与加强新中国的国防事业而奋斗，任何帝国主义的冒险与挑衅行为，也丝毫不能动摇我们坚定的决心！
    毛主席，我们敢向您这样保证。敬祝身体健康！
    石景山钢铁厂全体职工
                九月三十日
