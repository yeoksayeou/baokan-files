　　Remembering Seoul
　　Li Zhuang
　　The Korean People's Army left Seoul with grief and heavy hearts. As they left, they swore to Seoul: "We will return, and we will have a day of total counter-offensive!"
　　The Americans burned Seoul into a "sea of fire." According to reports from American and British news agencies: "Seoul's most prosperous commercial district has become a field of rubble." On this huge field of rubble, the Americans began appalling acts of terror. Ten thousand "suspects" who "reportedly cooperated with the communists" were arrested by the US-Syngman Rhee gangs, and rape and plunder were carried out openly. However, according to the Americans themselves: "Sabotage continues to occur in Seoul." This means that after the fall of Seoul, the people's resistance did not stop, but instead took on a new and more ingenious form.
　　Everything I saw in Seoul convinced me that the fall of this city could only be temporary. For more than thirty years, Seoul has been an unyielding city. In those days of frenzied bombing, I saw the work and struggle, the confidence and courage of the people of Seoul. This infinite strength, based on love for the motherland and hatred for the enemy, is forever invincible. The People's Army, which temporarily left Seoul, made a solemn oath to her, and the people who remained in Seoul are carrying out all kinds of struggles. All of Korea is waiting for the day when Seoul will be restored to its former glory.
　　Koreans love Seoul. Seoul is a beautiful city. The tree-lined avenues are wide and flat. The various trees in the Joseon Dynasty palace exude a deep and distant fragrance. In the evening, after the bombing intervals, the Han River appears particularly tranquil. The evening glow shines on the waveless water, reflecting a brocade-like brilliance. Koreans have built in Seoul for hundreds of years, and they affectionately call it "Seoul" - the capital.
　　Seoulites often say, "The past is not ours." Indeed, Seoul has the tallest Western-style buildings in Korea, and also the largest prisons. After the Japanese invaded Korea, they immediately built a tall white steel and concrete "Government-General" in Seoul, surrounded by high walls and electric fences, and the surrounding area was designated as a restricted zone. After the Japanese surrendered, this building was converted into a "military government" by the Americans, and when Syngman Rhee came onto the stage, he hung a "Presidential Palace" sign on the door. All kinds of murderous decrees flew out from here. Seoulites glared at it as they passed by. The eight-story Peninsula Hotel is the tallest building in Seoul, and it used to be the residence of Syngman Rhee's supreme emperor - the American "Ambassador" Muccio to the Syngman Rhee puppet regime. Muccio issued orders from this building, plundering millions of bushels of rice from South Korea every year. The Korean people used their blood and sweat to create these magnificent buildings, which were occupied by their enemies, while they themselves were thrown into other large buildings, such as the Seodaemun Prison, Yeongdeungpo Prison, Mapo Prison, and Army Prison, which could hold 20,000 "prisoners." These prisons were fully equipped, from prison cells to gallows, from courtrooms to large rooms for storing various instruments of torture.
　　For many years, Korean revolutionaries, centered on Seoul, waged life-and-death struggles against national rulers. Seoulites recounted to me with reverence and mourning the glorious deeds of Kim Son-ryong and Lee Ju-ha. Kim Son-ryong was a member of the Political Bureau of the Workers' Party of South Korea, and Lee Ju-ha was a member of the Central Organizing Committee of the Workers' Party of South Korea. They persisted in long-term underground struggles in Seoul and were later arrested by the US-Syngman Rhee gangs. The enemy used all kinds of torture to force them to reveal organizational secrets. To no avail. Finally, the enemy injected them with a special drug that could paralyze the nerves, hoping that they would unconsciously reveal something. Still to no avail. On June 27, on the eve of the liberation of Seoul, the US-Syngman Rhee gangs secretly executed these two loyal and unyielding revolutionary fighters. Similar things happened a lot in Seoul. Koreans have a glorious tradition of resisting foreign rulers. For forty years, striving for national independence has always been the great goal pursued by the Korean people in their dreams. In recent years, countless heroic events have frightened the Americans who invaded Korea. In 1946, the Americans issued an order in Seoul to arrest Park Heon-yeong, the leader of the Workers' Party of South Korea. Park Heon-yeong was not captured, but 300,000 Korean workers launched a major strike to protest the crimes of US imperialism. This strike had a tenacious persistence and later developed into the famous "April Struggle." The central content of the "April Struggle" was to demand that the Americans immediately withdraw from Korea. Two million workers, farmers, and students participated in this movement. In 1947, the people of Seoul held a grand "March 1st" memorial meeting to oppose American aggression and oppression. March 1st is the anniversary of the nationwide anti-Japanese uprising held by the entire Korean people in 1919. The "March 1st Uprising" dealt a heavy blow to the Japanese invaders. Although the uprising failed due to the Japanese's brutal suppression, the historical glory of the "March 1st Uprising" left Koreans with indelible memories. On March 1, 1947, the Americans opened fire on the Korean people in Seoul, killing more than fifty patriotic Koreans. "March 1st" added new content and meaning to the opposition to imperialist aggression.
　　This struggle continued until June of this year, when the Korean People's Army liberated Seoul. In order to protect this lovely city, the People's Army was ordered not to use artillery fire when attacking the city. I once spoke with a young officer who was not tall and had a pale face. His name was Kim Hyung-ok, and he was an art school student. He said: "We love Seoul. We attacked Seoul carefully and cautiously, and Seoul is intact. Of course, it also has some damage. You see, the Han River Bridge was blown up by the enemy, and the gate of the Seodaemun Prison was damaged by our tanks." He shook his head and said lightly: "But, this is nothing. We will repair the bridge soon." Every Korean felt honored and proud of the rapid and complete liberation of Seoul. However, a few days later, large-scale destruction began.
　　American planes frantically attacked Seoul, and the Yongsan district was almost razed to the ground. On some days, Seoul was under air raid alerts all day long. In the air raid shelter, I heard the cries of babies and the curses of mothers; under the eaves beside the road, I saw the anxious expressions of civil servants clutching briefcases and waiting for the all-clear; in a forest-filled barracks on Seoul's East Mountain, I participated in a peaceful discussion among People's Army soldiers, with the sound of heavy bombs exploding nearby; in the luxurious living room of the Chosun Hotel, the Seoul municipal authorities hosted a banquet for the Chinese People's Visiting Delegation, with representatives from China and Korea mingling their emotions and raising their glasses together to celebrate the victory of the Korean people. At this time, American jets constantly swept overhead, and the sound of machine guns reverberated through Seoul's clear sky.
　　In countless facts, I discovered that the Americans' atrocities gave the Korean people not terror, but anger; not fear, but contempt. In the Chosun Hotel, I saw a young car driver, lying silently on a large sofa. He had just returned from Dongdaemun. In Dongdaemun, he had a family with a three-room house, a wife, and a child. In the morning, this family was fine, but in the afternoon, this family turned into a large pit. He found nothing near the pit. People had no appropriate words to comfort this young man. Two hours later, a driving assignment broke this terrible silence. The young man grabbed his hat and said in an almost furious tone: "Americans, I'll drive a car to hit you." On the Han River Bridge, I participated in a humorous conversation among several workers. They took off their clothes, working and mocking the Americans at the same time. Worker Park Chang-ju used oxygen to bake the steel beams damaged by enemy aircraft, and said loudly: "Comrades, it's bad. The Americans dropped bombs into the river and messed up our underwater cables." The worker next to him continued: "Why not drop them on the bridge! The underwater cables can't be blown up, and we can rest for a while." Park Chang-ju completely disagreed with this opinion, saying: "The Americans are not on our side, they don't want you to rest!" The Han River Bridge was the main target of American planes, but these Korean workers working under the target were not intimidated by B-29s or jets at all.
　　I saw countless lines of people joining the army in Seoul. Tens of thousands of workers, students, and citizens joined the army in Seoul, accounting for almost one-tenth of the city's population. One afternoon, a team of new soldiers was walking near a four-story building when they encountered an attack by American planes. The new soldiers were wearing white clothes and standing in the shadows on the north side of the building. A People's Army lieutenant officer leading the team explained to the new soldiers that this was a B-29, this was a P-51... Everyone didn't look panicked at all. Some of the new soldiers were farmers who had never fought a war before, and now they were voluntarily going to the front lines. At this time, the land reform in the suburbs of Seoul had been completed, and the farmers had received 7.33 million pyeong (3,000 pyeong is equivalent to one hectare) of land. A farmer named Kim Chang-ui squatted on the side and told me about his two different experiences in half a month. He said that his family had been farmers for three generations without an inch of land. In the land reform, his family received more than 3,000 pyeong of land, and a family of four became middle peasants overnight. However, three days ago, his wife was carrying their two-year-old child and mowing grass in the field when both mother and child were killed by American planes at the same time. Kim Chang-ui collected the bodies of his wife and children and bid farewell to his elderly mother. He asked the People's Committee to go to the Daegu front immediately.
　　There are countless Kim Chang-ui in Seoul, and even more Kim Chang-ui in all of Korea. An Associated Press reporter said: "Small red dots on the intelligence map representing enemy (referring to the Korean People's Army) guerrillas are scattered throughout South Korea." These are all Kim Chang-ui. They are fighting hard and arduous battles, and they are all convinced that "we will return."

　　忆汉城
    李庄
    朝鲜人民军带着悲愤、沉重的心情离开汉城。他们临走时向汉城宣誓：“我们还要重来，我们将有总反攻的一天！”
    美国人把汉城烧成“火海”。据美英通讯社报道：“汉城最繁华的商业区已成一片瓦砾。”在这个巨大的瓦砾场上，美国人开始了惊人心魄的恐怖行动。一万个“据传曾与共产党合作”的“嫌疑分子”被美李匪帮逮捕，奸淫、抢掠公开进行。但是，据美国人自供：“汉城不断发生破坏行动。”这就是说，汉城沦陷以后，人民的反抗并没有停止，而是采取了一种新的更加巧妙的方式。
    在汉城看到的一切，使我确信这个城市的沦陷只能是暂时的。三十多年以来，汉城就是一个不屈服的城市。在那疯狂轰炸的日子里，我看到汉城人民的工作和斗争，信心与勇气，这种基于热爱祖国、仇恨敌人而产生的无穷力量，永远是不可战胜的。暂时离开汉城的人民军向她作了庄严的宣誓，留在汉城的人民正在进行各种各样的斗争，全朝鲜都在等待着重新光复汉城的日子。
    朝鲜人爱汉城。汉城是一座美丽的城市。林荫大道宽阔平坦。李朝故宫中各种各样的林木，散放着一种深远的清香。傍晚，在轰炸间歇以后，汉江显得格外宁静。晚霞照在无波的水面上，映出一片锦绣似的光辉。朝鲜人在汉城建设了几百年，他们亲妮地称它为“梭尔”——首都。
    汉城人常常说：“过去不是我们的。”真的，汉城有朝鲜最高的洋楼，也有朝鲜最大的监狱。日本人侵占朝鲜后，立即在汉城建造了一座高大的白色的钢骨水泥的“总督府”，用高墙和电网围着，附近都被划为禁区。日本人投降以后，这座房子被美国人改成“军政府”，李承晚粉墨登场后，又在门口挂上“总统府”的牌子。各种杀人的法令从这里飞出来。汉城人经过这里，都对它怒目而视。八层楼的半岛酒店是汉城最高的建筑物，这里曾经住过李承晚的太上皇——美国驻李承晚傀儡政权的缪锡俄“大使”。缪锡俄从这座大楼中发纵指使，每年从南朝鲜抢夺几百万石大米。朝鲜人民用血汗造成这些富丽堂皇的为他们的敌人所盘踞的建筑物，他们自己却被投入另外一些大建筑物中，这就是能容两万“犯人”的西大门监狱，永登浦监狱，麻浦监狱和陆军监狱。这些监狱中的设备是应有尽有，从囚室到绞架，从公堂到储藏各种刑具的大房子。
    多少年来，朝鲜的革命者以汉城为中心，对民族统治者展开生死的斗争。汉城人以虔敬、哀悼的语调，向我叙述金善隆和李舟河的光荣事迹。金善隆是南朝鲜劳动党政治局委员，李舟河是南朝鲜劳动党中央组织委员，他们在汉城坚持长期的地下斗争，后来被美李匪帮逮捕了。敌人施用各种刑罚，强迫他们说出组织秘密。没有丝毫效果。最后，敌人给他们注射一种特制的能麻痹神经的药水，想让他们在不知不觉中说出一些事情。也没有达到目的。六月二十七日，汉城解放前夕，美李匪帮秘密地处决了这两位忠贞不屈的革命战士。类似的事情在汉城是很多的。朝鲜人具有反抗外国统治者的光荣传统。四十年来，争取民族独立，始终是朝鲜人民梦寐求之的伟大目标。近几年来，无数英勇的事情曾经吓坏了侵入朝鲜的美国人。一九四六年，美国人在汉城发出逮捕南朝鲜劳动党领袖朴宪永的命令。朴宪永没有被捉住，三十万朝鲜工人却发动了一个大罢工，抗议美帝的罪行。这个罢工带有坚韧的持久性，以后发展为有名的“四月抗争”。“四月抗争”的中心内容是要求美国人立即退出朝鲜，参加这个运动的工人、农民、学生有两百万人。一九四七年，汉城人民举行盛大的“三一”纪念大会，反对美国人的侵略和压迫。三月一日是一九一九年全朝鲜人民举行反日起义的纪念日，“三一起义”曾经给予日本侵略者以沉重的打击。起义虽因日本人的残酷镇压而失败，但是，“三一起义”的历史光辉，却给朝鲜人留下永远不能磨灭的记忆。一九四七年三月一日，美国人在汉城向朝鲜人民开火，杀死五十多个爱国的朝鲜人。“三月一日”，又增添了反对帝国主义侵略的新的内容和意义。
    这种斗争一直延续到今年六月，朝鲜人民军解放了汉城。为了保护这个可爱的城市，人民军受命在攻城时不得用大炮射击。我曾和一个身材不高、脸色苍白的青年军官谈话，他叫金衡玉，是艺术学校的学生。他说：“我们爱汉城。我们小心谨慎地攻打汉城，汉城是完好的。当然，它也有一些损伤。你看，汉江大桥被敌人炸断了，西大门监狱的大门被我们的坦克撞坏了。”他摇摇头轻快地说：“不过，这不算什么。我们很快会把桥修好的。”每一个朝鲜人对于汉城的迅速而完好的解放，都感到光荣和骄傲。但是，几天以后，大规模的破坏就开始了。
    美国飞机疯狂地袭击汉城，龙山区几被夷为平地。有些日子，汉城整天都在警报中。我在防空洞中，听到婴儿的哭声和母亲们的咒骂；在马路旁边的屋檐下，看到挟着皮包等待解除警报的公务员的焦急的表情；在汉城东山上一个林木森森的兵营中，我参加了人民军战士们神态安详的讨论会，附近不断传来重磅炸弹的爆炸声；在富丽堂皇的朝鲜饭店的客厅中，汉城市政当局招待中国人民访问团举行宴会，中朝人民的代表情感交融，共同举杯庆祝朝鲜人民的胜利，这时候，美国的喷气式飞机不断掠空而过，机枪声响彻汉城清朗的天空。
    我在无数事实中，发现美国人的暴行给予朝鲜人民的，不是恐怖，而是愤怒；不是畏缩，而是蔑视。在朝鲜饭店，我看到一个年青的汽车司机，他一语不发地躺在一个大沙发里。他才从东大门回来。东大门有他一个三间房子、一个老婆和一个孩子的家庭。上午，这个家庭还是好好的，下午，这个家庭变成一个大坑。他在大坑附近，没有找到任何东西。人们没有适当的言语安慰这个青年人。两小时后，行车任务打破了这种可怕的沉默。青年人抓起帽子，用一种近乎狂怒的语调说：“美国人，老子开上车子打你。”在汉江桥上，我参加过几个工人的一场笑谈。他们脱光衣服，一面工作，一面奚落美国人。工人朴昌举用氧气烘烧被敌机炸坏的钢梁，大声说道：“同志们，糟糕。美国人把炸弹丢到江里，把咱们的水底电线搞乱了。”旁边的工人接着说：“还是丢到桥上吧！水底电线炸不坏，咱们还可以休息一阵子。”朴昌举完全不同意这个意见，他说：“美国人和咱们不对头，他可不愿意让你休息！”汉江桥是美国飞机的主要目标，但是，这些在目标下工作的朝鲜工人，丝毫没有被Ｂ二十九式或喷气式飞机所吓倒。
    我在汉城看到无数参军的行列。汉城参军的工人、学生、市民有十几万人，几乎占了这个城市的十分之一。一个中午，一队新战士走在一幢四层楼的大厦附近，遇到美国飞机的袭击。新战士穿着白衣服，站在大厦北边的阴影里。一个带头的人民军中尉军官向新战士们解释，这是Ｂ二十九，这是Ｐ五十一……大家没有任何惊慌的样子。新战士中有一部分农民，从来没有打过仗，现在自动到前线去。这时候，汉城郊区的土地改革已经完成，农民们得到七百三十三万坪（三千坪相当一海克脱）土地。有一个名叫金昌义的农民，蹲在一边，向我叙述他半个月中两种不同的经历。他说，他三代务农，没有一坪土地。在土地改革中，他家得地三千多坪，四口人的家庭，一夜之间变成中农。但是，三天以前，他的老婆背着两岁多的孩子在田中刈草，母子两人同时被美国飞机打死了。金昌义收拾了妻儿的尸体，告别了年迈的母亲，他向人民委员会要求，马上到大邱前线去。
    汉城有无数金昌义，全朝鲜有更多的金昌义。美联社记者说：“情报地图上代表敌人（指朝鲜人民军）游击队的小红点，散布在整个南朝鲜。”这些都是金昌义。他们正在作着坚苦卓绝的斗争，他们都是确信“我们还要重来”的。
