To strengthen service to the industrial and commercial sectors, promptly report government policies and regulations related to industry and commerce, assist the government in promoting work and answering various operational and management questions faced by the industrial and commercial sectors, widely exchange business experiences, and provide business knowledge to the industrial and commercial sectors, the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station has decided to add an "Industry and Commerce Program" starting next month.

This program is jointly organized by the preparatory committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce and the station. Before starting the preparation of this program, opinions on promoting this work were widely exchanged with relevant parties. On the 19th of this month, a preparatory meeting for holding the "Industry and Commerce Program" was convened, attended by representatives from the municipal news, labor, and commerce bureaus, as well as 21 units from various industries such as weaving and dyeing, department stores, grain, silk and satin, local products, hardware, and traditional Chinese medicine. Ling Qijun, Deputy Director of the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, served as the chairman, and announced the plan to add the Industry and Commerce Program at the meeting. Representatives from various municipal bureaus and industries unanimously expressed that the addition of the "Industry and Commerce Program" was very necessary, and believed that understanding the government's policies and regulations related to industry and commerce, familiarizing oneself with and increasing business knowledge through broadcasting, was the most effective and convenient method. After enthusiastic discussions among the representatives of various industries, the time and frequency of the Industry and Commerce Program, as well as the draft organizational methods for setting up radio operators among private industrial and commercial households, were initially approved. It was decided that before the 26th of this month, radio affairs officers would be selected in each industry first, and a meeting of radio affairs officers would be held in order to quickly start promoting the work of arranging radio operators.
