　　Ensuring the Health of Huai River Workers
    Anhui North Production and Huai River Harnessing Headquarters Deploys Health and Medical Work
    [By this Newspaper] Production for disaster relief and harnessing the Huai River is currently the central task of Anhui North. The Health Department of the Anhui North Production Relief and Huai River Harnessing Temporary Headquarters is actively deploying epidemic prevention, healthcare, hygiene, and medical work for river workers.

    According to Xing Ming, the head of the department: the cadres of the various departments under the department have been largely equipped. Work will be gradually carried out according to plan. (1) Epidemic prevention and treatment teams will be established in the river work sections and severely affected areas, composed of epidemic prevention and medical teams from the central government, East China, and the Anhui North Administrative Office Health Department that are working in various counties of Anhui North. The existing 500 or so staff members will be organized into several small and medium-sized teams, ready to be dispatched to disaster areas and embankments for mobile medical rescue work at any time. As for current epidemic prevention, vaccinations against typhoid, smallpox, cholera, malaria, and kala-azar are being carried out. (2) Civil worker medical stations will be generally established in the river work areas, and Chinese and Western medicine practitioners from various counties and townships will be mobilized to participate in the work. (3) A health committee will be established under the Health Department, absorbing the leaders of epidemic prevention teams from various special districts and medical experts to guide the work. The East China Ministry of Health has also hired several experts to help with the work. (4) It is planned to establish a relatively large-scale civil worker sanatorium in Jiulonggang, Huai Mine. Once construction begins, work will be vigorously carried out. In addition, special attention will be paid to guiding and helping the environmental and personal hygiene of civil workers and disaster victims, and efforts will be made to combine prevention and treatment to ensure the health of the vast number of civil workers and disaster victims, so as to ensure the completion of river work as scheduled.
