　　Xinhua News Agency, 14th: After the Truman government launched the war of aggression against Korea, it took advantage of the war-induced hysteria to submit a series of military expansion appropriation plans to the US Congress, and at the same time, it put forward a large number of tax increase requirements, thus placing a heavy burden on the American people.
　　In January of this year, Truman proposed and the Congress passed in late August the 1950-51 budget, the direct military expenditure has reached 15 billion US dollars, plus more than 1.22 billion US dollars for the so-called "military assistance," accounting for nearly half of the total budget of 34 billion US dollars. After the outbreak of the Korean War, Truman, under the pretext of "US security" needs, successively proposed huge supplementary military spending bills. By the time Congress adjourned on September 22, the total amount of supplementary military spending reached 17 billion US dollars, including 4 billion US dollars for increasing equipment for the aggressive forces of the Atlantic Treaty countries. This made the direct military expenditure for 1950-51 reach more than 33 billion US dollars, accounting for about 65 percent of the total budget that has been passed.
　　According to Alan, a Washington correspondent for the New York Post, the US government has drafted a military estimate, which is still kept secret for political reasons, stipulates that the total military budget for 1950-51 is 62 billion US dollars, which is twice as much as it is now. This does not include the 6 to 8 billion US dollars planned for the development of guided rockets and atomic weapons. According to Alan, these appropriation requests will be submitted one after another when Congress reconvenes after the November congressional elections.
　　The above-mentioned huge non-productive military expenditures will multiply the US government's fiscal deficit, which is already in the billions. In addition to cutting flesh to heal sores, and using the reduction of non-military expenditures, which were already pitifully small in comparison to the huge military expenditures, to make up for some of it, the Truman government decided to impose this burden on the working people with a large increase in taxes.
　　After the US Congress has generally reduced the non-military part of the budget by one-fifth, according to the US government's budget office announced a few days ago, another 580 million US dollars will be deducted from the amount that Congress has already passed. The projects that have been cut include the construction of civilian hospitals and rural houses, rural electrification and tenant farmer loans.
　　According to Truman's request, Congress has passed a $4.5 billion tax increase on September 22. The increased tax revenue will mainly be added to the working people. The tax regulations stipulate that people with an annual income of 800 to 2,000 US dollars, that is, the main labor population of the United States, will have a tax increase of between 20 and 21 percent, while for the rich with an annual income of more than 500,000 US dollars, the increase is only 11 percent. For companies that have made staggering profits in the military expansion, the maximum increase is only 18 percent. In fact, capitalists usually pass the burden entirely on to consumers by raising commodity prices. Therefore, even the New York Times cannot but admit: "The biggest tax burden falls on people with low incomes."
　　As government and congressional officials have revealed, the $4.5 billion tax increase is only the first batch. Truman is considering proposing further increases in the future. Senator Republican leader Taft, in a broadcast supporting Truman's tax increase plan, bluntly told listeners that the "semi-mobilization" state that the United States is currently completing should be regarded as a "normal situation for ten to fifteen years" (Agence France-Presse, July 23), and he also said: "In addition to the military aid program, the annual military budget that the United States needs to cope with will amount to 50 to 60 billion US dollars." And this cost, in his opinion, must be solved by taxes, because "the biggest advantage of tax increases is to deprive taxpayers of a portion of their money." Taft's opinion can be said to be a representative opinion.

### 杜鲁门政府发动侵略朝鲜战争后  连续提出庞大军事预算  沉重的税收负担压在劳动人民身上

　　杜鲁门政府发动侵略朝鲜战争后
    连续提出庞大军事预算
    沉重的税收负担压在劳动人民身上
    【新华社十四日讯】美国杜鲁门政府在发动侵略朝鲜的战争之后，利用战争所引起的歇斯底里气氛，向美国国会提出了一连串扩军拨款计划，同时提出大量增税的要求，因而把沉重的负担压到美国人民的头上。
    今年一月杜鲁门提出而于八月下旬经国会通过的一九五○——五一年度预算案，直接军事费用已达一百五十亿美元，外加用于所谓“军事援助”的十二亿二千多万美元，几占总预算三百四十亿美元的一半。朝鲜战争爆发后，杜鲁门借口“美国安全”需要，连续提出巨大补充军费案，到九月二十二日国会休会前日通过时，补充军费总额达一百七十亿美元，其中包括用于增加装备大西洋公约国家侵略部队的四十亿美元。这使得一九五○——五一年度直接军事费用达到三百三十多亿美元，占已通过的全部预算总额的约百分之六十五。
    据纽约邮报驻华盛顿记者阿兰说，美国政府已拟定而迄今为政治理由尚保守秘密的军事概算，规定一九五○——五一年度军事预算总额为六百二十亿美元，即较现在还要多一倍。这中间还不包括计划用于发展定向火箭和原子武器的六十亿到八十亿美元。据阿兰说，这些拨款要求将在十一月国会选举后国会复会时陆续提出。
    上述庞大的非生产性的军事费用的开支，将使原已高达数十亿的美国政府财政赤字增加好几倍。除了挖肉补疮，用削减在巨大军费相形之下本来就已少得可怜的非军事开支来作一些弥补之外，杜鲁门政府决定以大量增税来把这笔负担压在劳动人民身上。
    在美国国会已经普遍削减预算中非军事部分五分之一以后，据美国政府预算局于数日前宣布，将再自国会已经通过的数目中减去五亿八千万美元，被削减的项目包括民用医院及乡村房屋的建筑、农村电气化和佃农贷款等。
    按照杜鲁门的要求，国会已于九月二十二日通过增税四十五亿美元。增加的税额将主要加在劳动人民身上。税例规定全年收入八百美元到二千美元的人、即美国主要的劳动人口，增税在百分之二十与二十一之间，而对于年收五十万美元以上的富豪们，则只增百分之十一。对于在扩军中获致惊人利润的公司，最高只增百分之十八。事实上，资本家通常是通过提高商品价格的办法把负担又完全转嫁到消费者身上。所以连纽约时报都不能不承认：“最大的税收负担，落在收入低微的人身上”。
    如政府及国会人员所透露的，四十五亿美元增税只是第一批。杜鲁门正考虑今后再陆续提出增加。参院共和党领袖塔夫脱在广播中支持杜鲁门的增税计划时，曾赤裸裸地告诉听众说，美国目前正在完成的“半动员”状态，应看作是“十年到十五年之久的正常情况”（法新社七月二十三日电），他并且说：“除了军事援助计划以外，美国每年需要应付的军备预算，为数将达五百亿至六百亿美元。”而这笔费用，据他的意见，就得用税收来解决，因为“增税的最大好处就是，剥夺纳税人的一部分钱”。塔夫脱的这个意见，可说是代表性的意见。
