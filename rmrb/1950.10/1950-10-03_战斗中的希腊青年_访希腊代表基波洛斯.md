　　The Fighting Greek Youth
　　——An Interview with Greek Representative Kipolos
　　World Democratic Youth League representative Kipolos from Greece told reporters that Greek youth are bravely fighting against imperialist and royalist fascist forces.

　　In 1941, Greece was occupied by the Hitler and Mussolini fascist bandits. The Greek Communist Party and other democratic parties jointly carried out the liberation struggle against the invaders. The Greek people and youth fought in various ways. Thanks to the Soviet Red Army's victory over fascist Germany, which had great historical significance, and thanks to the liberation struggle of the Greek People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Greek Communist Party, Greece was finally liberated from the rule of German and Italian fascists in 1944. After liberation, British imperialism, aided by domestic Greek reactionaries, occupied Greek territory. The Greek people, just as they did against Hitler, waged a heroic resistance against British imperialism.

　　After the Greek people exposed the conspiracies of the British aggressors and severely打击(dǎjī; struck) them, Britain sold Greece to American imperialism. However, the Greek people fought against American imperialism with the same courage and fortitude.

　　Kipolos recounted the suffering of the Greek people from 1941 to the present. In Greece, one hundred and seventy villages were burned down successively by German and Italian fascists, British and American imperialists, and domestic reactionaries. Currently, one million people have no houses to live in, no food to eat, no work to do, and are wandering the streets, simply because they refuse to work for the reactionaries. Half of Greek workers are unemployed. The general price level is 374 percent higher than before the war. In Greece, there are hundreds of prisons and concentration camps jointly established by American imperialists and the reactionary government, imprisoning 380,000 patriotic Greek people. Every day, the constabulary shoots hundreds of outstanding Greek patriots.

　　Due to the reign of terror by American and British imperialism and Greek reactionaries, the Greek people were forced to take up arms and establish their own people's army.

　　In 1947, the Greek People's Liberation Army liberated all the territory except for a few major cities, and prepared to launch an all-out general offensive. At that time, the U.S. imperialists were also preparing to abandon Greece. However, at this decisive moment, the Tito clique, in order to comply with the will of its American masters, assisted the royalist fascist bandits in massacring the Greek people and allowed the royalist army to attack the rear of the Greek Liberation Army under false pretenses, placing the Greek liberation war in an extremely unfavorable position. However, contrary to the expectations of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, the Greek people did not yield, and the guerrillas remained very active. In the cities, strikes and demonstrations continued to occur.

　　The Greek people firmly believe that victory belongs to the Greek people.

　　The Greek youth struggle is being carried out under the leadership of the Greek Communist Party and the Panhellenic Youth Union.

　　During the German fascist occupation, the Panhellenic Youth Union united 80 percent of the country's youth to fight against German fascism. Now it has gone underground. The heroic members of the Panhellenic Youth Union are carrying out the peace signature campaign under the rule of royalist fascist terror. They write slogans against the reactionary government on the walls, and they distribute underground mimeographed newspapers to the people.

　　The Greek Youth League stands at the forefront of the struggle against royalist fascists and imperialists. To protest the reactionary government's decision to sentence patriots to death, university students in the cities of Thessaloniki and Athens held demonstrations. Middle school students also actively participated in the marches. Progressive organizations around the world support the just actions of Greek youth.

　　Serpos concluded by saying that the Greek fascist royalists are carrying out a brutal suppression of the youth movement because they know that Greek youth are a powerful and indestructible force.

　　The Greek people and youth will never allow Greece to become a military base for British and American imperialist plots to invade the Soviet Union.

　　战斗中的希腊青年
    ——访希腊代表基波洛斯
    世界民主青年联盟代表团希腊代表基波洛斯告诉记者，希腊青年正在英勇地进行反帝反保皇法西斯的斗争。
    一九四一年希腊被希特勒及墨索里尼法西斯匪徒所占领。希腊共产党和其他民主党派一道进行了反对侵略者的解放斗争。希腊人民和青年用各种方式进行斗争。由于具有伟大历史意义的苏联红军对法西斯德国的胜利，由于在希共领导下的希腊人民解放军的解放斗争，希腊终于一九四四年从德意法西斯的统治下解放出来。解放以后，英帝国主义得到希腊国内反动派的帮助，占领了希腊国土，希腊人民对英帝国主义，正和对希特勒一样，进行了英勇的抵抗。
    希腊人民揭露了英国侵略者的阴谋并严重地打击了英国侵略者之后，他便把希腊出卖给美帝国主义。但是希腊人民都以同样的英勇坚强地同美帝国主义斗争。
    基波洛斯向记者叙述了一九四一年迄今的希腊人民的苦难。在希腊，曾有一百七十个村庄先后被德意法西斯、英美帝国主义及国内反动派所烧毁。目前有一百万人民没有房子住，没有饭吃，没有工作，流浪在街头。只是因为他们拒绝为反动派工作。希腊工人中有一半失业。一般物价比战前高百分之三七四。在希腊有几百个美帝和反动政府共设的监狱和集中营，监禁了三十八万爱国的希腊人民。宪兵每天都枪杀几百个优秀的希腊爱国人士。
    由于美英帝国主义和希腊反动派的恐怖统治，希腊人民被迫拿起武器，并建立人民自己的军队。
    一九四七年希腊人民解放军解放了除去几个大城市以外的全部国土，并且准备进行全面性的总进攻。所以那时美帝也准备放弃希腊。可是正当在这个决定性的时机，铁托匪帮为了顺从他的美国主子的意旨，竟协助保皇法西斯匪徒们屠杀希腊人民，允许保皇军假道进攻希腊解放军的后方，使希腊解放战争处于异常不利的地位。不过，出乎美帝和他的走狗们意料之外，希腊人民并没有屈服，游击队依然十分活跃，在城市里，罢工及示威游行不断地发生。
    希腊人民坚决相信胜利是属于希腊人民的。
    希腊青年斗争是在希共及全希腊青年联盟的领导下进行的。
    在法西斯德国占领的时候，希腊青年联盟团结了国内百分之八十的青年向德国法西斯展开斗争。现在它转入地下活动。英勇的希腊青年联盟的盟员们正在保皇法西斯恐怖的统治下进行征集和平签名运动。他们在墙壁上写反对反动政府的口号，他们把地下油印的报纸送给人民。
    希腊青年联盟站在反保皇法西斯及帝国主义者的斗争的最前线。为了反对反动政府判处爱国人士死刑的决定，西拉尼克和雅典两个城市大学生举行了示威游行。中学生也积极参加了游行活动。全世界进步组织都支援希腊青年的正义行动。
    塞波洛斯最后说，希腊法西斯保皇党对青年运动施以残酷的镇压，因为他们知道希腊青年是一支强大不可摧毁的力量。
    希腊人民和青年决不让希腊成为英美帝国主义阴谋侵略苏联的军事基地。
