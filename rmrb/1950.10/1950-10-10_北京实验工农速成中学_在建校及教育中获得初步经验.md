　　Beijing Experimental Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School

　　Gains Preliminary Experience in School Establishment and Education

　　[This newspaper reports] The Beijing Experimental Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School, directly under the leadership of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and with the assistance and guidance of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, has gained some preliminary experience in its first semester of operation. The school has a total of 116 students, of whom 109 are from worker or peasant families and are either revolutionary workers themselves or also from worker or peasant families, accounting for 93.9% of the total; most are between the ages of 21 and 25; most have participated in more than three years of revolutionary work, and some have worked for as long as 13 years. There are 47 combat heroes, labor heroes, and work models who have been commended for their meritorious service. Teachers are hired through certain organizational relationships and generally have a university or college degree, as well as considerable teaching experience and political understanding.

　　The school's enrollment work is carried out through a combination of organizational transfer and examination. The family background, personal origin, years of revolutionary service, and political qualities of the admitted students all meet the conditions stipulated by the central government. However, in terms of academic level and health, the standards were somewhat lowered because the requirements in these areas were not firmly implemented during enrollment. For example, only 37 students had a math level equivalent to upper primary school graduation, 29 had a lower upper primary school level, and 50 had only a lower primary school level, which made teaching and class allocation difficult later on. No infectious disease checks were conducted during the health examination, and seven students deemed unsuitable for long-term study by the doctor were also admitted out of consideration for other factors. In addition, due to insufficient publicity and communication with relevant departments before enrollment, most students did not understand the nature and mission of the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School when applying. Some units sent students who did not meet the enrollment requirements in terms of years of revolutionary service, had too poor academic levels, and some even sent the children of cadres to apply. According to the educational mission of the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School, which is to enable students to acquire a secondary school level of cultural and basic scientific knowledge in three to four years, so that they can go on to higher education for further study, it is difficult for students with too low academic levels or who are over 27 or 28 years old and progress relatively slowly and have poor memory to complete this task. Therefore, it is essential to strengthen the publicity of the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School's principles and tasks during enrollment and strictly implement the enrollment conditions stipulated by the central government.

　　There is a great disparity in the academic level of students when they enter the school. At the beginning of the semester, students were assigned to Class A (the best), Class B (medium), and Class C (the worst) based on their entrance examination scores in Chinese and arithmetic. At that time, some people advocated mixed class allocation, arguing that it would facilitate mutual assistance among students. After research and discussion, it was deemed incorrect to mechanically apply the mixed class allocation method used in cadre schools for political study in a regular new-type school. Experience from the past semester has shown that strict class allocation according to academic level allows students to improve on their existing foundation and avoids the difficulty of teachers having to accommodate students of different levels, and it does not affect mutual assistance among classmates.

　　The three- to four-year Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School, plus the three to five years of study in higher education, is a long-term learning process, so it is necessary to establish a long-term learning mindset among students after they enroll. During enrollment, it was learned from the registration, interviews, and other processes that the original motivation of most students was not to become specialized talents for building a new China, but simply because they felt difficulties in their work due to their low academic level and wanted to improve their education before returning to general work. Therefore, the Dean's Office explained the nature and mission of the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School to the students during the examination so that everyone could be mentally prepared. In order to further consolidate the long-term learning mindset, ideological education on long-term learning is regularly carried out in the school. However, in the middle of the semester, as the lessons became more difficult, some students with poorer academic levels became pessimistic and disappointed, some were afraid of falling behind, and some were afraid that the school would order them to withdraw or be transferred back to their original units; the vast majority resented their poor foundation, so they studied desperately, without rest or recreation, and did not go out on Sundays, rising early and sleeping late. As a result, many people suffered from insomnia and mental fatigue at night. At that time, the school authorities listened to students' opinions through teacher-student forums, explained the school's attitude, and dispelled all their unnecessary concerns. At the same time, in order to reverse the students' learning mood, in addition to reassuring them ideologically, the curriculum did not rigidly pursue progress, but rather started slowly to lay a good foundation, and improved teaching methods in mathematics, practiced more in class, and provided more assistance to individual students. In this way, the students' mood stabilized, their health improved, and their academic performance generally improved.

　　The general characteristics of students' performance in learning are high political awareness, rich experience in struggle, strong comprehension of issues related to their past lives, a positive, serious, humble, and pragmatic learning attitude, and a clear class stand, able to distinguish right from wrong. Their judgment of events and evaluation of people are based on whether they are progressive or beneficial to the people and the revolution. When they encounter doubts, they must get to the bottom of them. However, they have poor memory, an imbalance of basic knowledge in various subjects, a narrow utilitarian point of view, hoping to learn things that can be used immediately, and conservative old experiences, which hinder them from accepting scientific knowledge well. According to the experience of the Beijing Experimental Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School in one semester, in education, it is necessary to firmly grasp the above characteristics, promote the positive aspects, and criticize the negative aspects; in terms of methods, it is necessary to combine their actual struggle life, raise the students' various practical experiences to a theoretical height, and combine them with scientific knowledge, paying attention to using methods such as charts, experiments, and visits for teaching.

　　北京实验工农速成中学
    在建校及教育中获得初步经验
    【本报讯】由中央人民政府教育部直接领导及北京市文教局协助指导的北京实验工农速成中学，在开办以后的第一个学期中，已获得了一些初步的经验。该校全校学生共一百十六人，家庭是工农成份而本人为革命工作人员或同为工农成份者一百零九人，占总数百分之九三·九；年龄以二十一岁到二十五岁最多；大都曾参加三年以上革命工作，且有曾工作十三年者。在工作中立过功得过奖的战斗英雄、劳动英雄及工作模范共四十七人。教师是通过一定的组织关系调聘的，一般都有大学或专科毕业的文化水平及相当的教学经验和政治认识。
    该校的招生工作是采取通过组织抽调和考试结合的办法进行的。所收学生的家庭成份、个人出身、革命年限及政治品质等，都符合中央规定的条件。但在文化程度和健康情况方面，因为招生时对这方面的条件执行不坚决，以致部分的降低了标准。如算术程度达高小毕业的仅三十七人，其他高小程度的二十九人，初小程度的则占五十人，使后来的教学及编班工作受到困难。在健康检查时，未进行传染病检查，经医师检定不宜长期学习的七人，为了照顾其他条件也录取了。另外，在招生前由于宣传及与各有关部门联系得不够，致学生投考时多数不了解工农速成中学的性质和任务。有些机关选送的学生中，有革命年限不够入学条件的，程度太差的，甚至有把干部子弟送来投考的。根据工农速成中学要在三年到四年的时间内，使学生获得中学程度的文化及科学基本知识，使能升入高等学校深造的这个教育任务，学生文化程度太低或年龄超过二十七八岁，进步比较慢，记忆力也比较差的学生，是难以完成这个任务的。所以，招生时加强对工农速成中学方针任务的宣传，严格执行中央规定的入学条件是十分必要的。
    学生入学时，程度差别很大。开学时，就按照学生国文、算术二科入学考试成绩，最好的编入甲班，中等的编入乙班，最差的编入丙班。当时曾有人主张混合编班，理由是便于学生互助。后经过研究讨论，认为在正规的新型学校内，机械的搬运干部学校政治学习的混合编班办法，是不对的。从一学期以来的经验看到，严格按程度编班，可使学生在原有的基础上提高，并避免教员难于兼顾学生高低程度的困难，而且这样做亦并不影响同学间的互助。
    三年到四年的工农速成中学，再加上升入高等学校学习三年至五年的时间，这是一个长期的学习过程，故学生入学后建立起长期学习思想是必要的。该校在招生时，从报名、登记、口试等过程中了解，原来一般学生的入学动机，并不想作建设新中国的专门人才，而仅仅是因为文化程度太低在工作中感到了困难，想来提高文化后再作一般工作的。因此，教导处在考试时，就向同学说明工农速成中学的性质和任务，让大家好有个思想准备。为了进一步巩固长期学习的思想，在学校中经常进行长期学习的思想教育。但到学期中段功课较深，在程度较差的学生中，有的悲观失望，有的怕跟不上，怕学校令其退学或调回原机关；绝大多数则是怨恨自己基础差，于是就拼命学习，不休息，不娱乐，星期日也不出门，早起迟睡。于是就有许多人夜里失眠，精神疲倦。当时学校当局通过师生座谈听取了同学意见，说明校方态度，打破他们一切不必要的顾虑。同时，为了扭转学生学习情绪，除在思想上使他们安心学习外，课程上不硬求进度，开始时宁可慢一些，使能打好基础，并在数学上改进教学法，课堂上多练习，对个别同学多加帮助。这样，学生情绪安定下来，健康有了好转，功课上也普遍有了进步。
    在学习中，一般学生表现的特点，是政治觉悟高，斗争经验丰富，对自己过去生活有联系的问题理解力强，有积极、认真、虚心、踏实的学习态度，阶级立场明确，能明辨是非，他们对事件的判断和人物的衡量，都以进步与否或对人民和革命是否有利作为判断的尺度。碰到疑问，就一定要追根究底弄明白。但记忆力较差，各科基础知识不平衡，有狭隘的实用观点，希望学的马上能用，保守旧经验，阻碍了自己很好的接受科学知识。根据北京实验工农速成中学一个学期的经验，在教育上，必须紧紧掌握住以上的这些特点，发扬积极的一面，批判消极的一面；在方法上，必须结合他们的实际斗争生活，把学生的各种实际经验提高到理论的高度，并与科学知识结合起来，注意以图表、实验、参观等方法进行教学。
