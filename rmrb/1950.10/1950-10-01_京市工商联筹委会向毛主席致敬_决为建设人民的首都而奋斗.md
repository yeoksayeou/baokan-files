　　Beijing Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee Pays Respects to Chairman Mao
    Resolves to Strive for the Construction of the People's Capital
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] On National Day, the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce wrote a letter to Chairman Mao to pay their respects and resolved to strive for the construction of the people's capital. The original letter is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
    On this day of great joy and excitement, as we welcome the first National Day celebration, the industrial and commercial circles of Beijing Municipality specifically write this letter to you, reporting on the situation of industry and commerce in Beijing, and extending to you our highest respect.
    The abnormal state and disasters in the social economy left over from years of reactionary rule are gradually being eliminated with the new construction. Since the implementation of the unified financial and economic work in March of this year, prices have been unprecedentedly stable, making the foundation of national finance more solid and creating more favorable conditions for the development of industry and commerce. Under your leadership, the economic front has achieved its first victory. In the process of reorganizing the social economy over the past year, thanks to the government's vigorous adjustments, support, leadership, and education, we have overcome various difficulties and embarked on a new path of development. Since June of this year, the market has generally shown a thriving atmosphere. We industrialists and business people have more clearly realized that we must, under your leadership, rely on our own strength, closely unite around the government, develop production, and prosper the economy in accordance with the Common Program's economic policies, and build a new China that is independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous.
    We feel that what we have done today is not enough, and we should make further efforts in future economic construction, overcome difficulties, enthusiastically respond to your call at the Third Plenary Session, and strive for a fundamental turn for the better in our country's financial and economic situation, to express our heartfelt gratitude and respect. We will wholeheartedly strive for the construction of the people's capital! Let us shout long live the People's Republic of China! Long live the Chinese Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao!
          The Preparatory Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce
