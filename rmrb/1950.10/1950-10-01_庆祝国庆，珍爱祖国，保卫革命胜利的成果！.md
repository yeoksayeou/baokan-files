　　Celebrate National Day, Cherish the Motherland, and Defend the Fruits of Revolutionary Victory!
　　Combat Hero of the Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army, Liu Meicun
　　October 1st – National Day – is the most glorious day. I feel extremely excited and honored to be able to come to Beijing to participate in the celebrations.
　　This day marks the victory of the motherland in the great people's revolutionary struggle, and the establishment of a government of the people. The old and unreasonable social system has been completely destroyed, and the people of the whole country have become masters. This is unprecedented in history. It is from this day forward that the people of the whole country can forever enjoy a happy and fulfilling life. I think this is why this day is so glorious. Therefore, the people of the whole country are warmly welcoming it with infinite joy.
　　Another thought I have is that the arrival of this victorious day was not easy. It was won by the bloodshed and sweat of revolutionary martyrs over the past few decades, the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the successive sacrifices of the People's Liberation Army in coordination with the people of the whole country. Therefore, we should not only celebrate it, but also cherish it very much.
　　One more thought is that although the Chinese revolution has achieved basic victory, and the people have their own government and their own country, the American imperialists are envious and want to use all kinds of barbaric actions to undermine it, openly invading our Taiwan, and using airplanes to strafe and injure our compatriots in Andong. We resolutely do not allow such barbaric behavior by American imperialism. Although I have been wounded eight times in the Liberation War and have become disabled, I am determined to dedicate myself selflessly in the future, regardless of all sacrifices and bloodshed, to defend this revolutionary victory and consolidate this revolutionary victory!

　　庆祝国庆，珍爱祖国，保卫革命胜利的成果！
    中南军区、四野战斗英雄  刘梅村
    十月一日——国庆日，是最伟大的日子，我能够来到北京参加庆祝，觉得非常兴奋和光荣。
    这个日子标志着祖国在伟大的人民革命斗争中获得了胜利，建立了人民自己的政府；旧的不合理的社会制度全部摧毁了，全国人民当了主人。这是有史以来所未有的，也就是从这个日子起，全国人民可以永远得到幸福和愉快的美满生活了，我想这个日子之所以伟大就是因为这个道理。因之，全国人民都以无限欢喜的心情来热烈地迎接它。
    我的另一个感想是：这个胜利日子的到来是不易的，是由于数十年来革命先烈们的流血流汗，中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，和在全国人民配合下的人民解放军的前仆后继流血牺牲换来的，所以我们不但庆祝它，而且应当非常珍爱它。
    再一个感想，即是中国革命虽然获得基本胜利了，人民有了自己的政府自己的国家，但美帝国主义者看了眼红，想用一切野蛮行动来破坏，公开侵略我们的台湾，用飞机在安东扫射杀伤我们的同胞，美帝国主义这种野蛮行为，我们是坚决不允许的，虽然我在解放战争中曾负过八次伤，成了残废，但今后我决定以忘我精神，不顾一切的牺牲流血，来保卫这个革命的胜利，巩固这个革命的胜利！
