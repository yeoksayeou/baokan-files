　　People Along the Jiyun Canal
    Actively Drain Water from Low-lying Areas to Plant Winter Wheat
    [This newspaper reports] After the Chaobai River water was diverted into the new channel of the Jiyun Canal, the water level significantly decreased, allowing for smoother drainage in the low-lying areas along the canal. Approximately 450,000 mu of land has now been freed from waterlogging and can be entirely planted with winter wheat. This is a new situation emerging along the Jiyun Canal after the Chaobai River's new channel began carrying water. The Qingdian and Taihe areas in Ji County, the Lin Nancang area in Yu Tian, the Hongnianggang area in Sanhe, and the Dazhongzhuang area in Bao坻, which were previously unable to be cultivated due to years of water accumulation, can now drain their water thanks to the significant drop in the Jiyun Canal's water level since the diversion of the Chaobai River this summer. The Ji County, Yu Tian, Sanhe, and Bao坻 county governments, with the assistance of the Ji-Luan River Affairs Bureau, are actively organizing drainage efforts. In Qingdian, Ji County, 17,000 mu of land had been drained by September 10th. In the Taihe area of Ji County and the Lin Nancang area of Yu Tian, the water source was cut off after the closure of the breach at Mozhuangzi on the left bank of the Zhou River on August 25th, resulting in approximately 20,000 mu of drained land by September 15th. In Hongnianggang, Sanhe, 120,000 mu of land had been drained by September 10th. In the Dazhongzhuang area of Bao坻, 140,000 mu of land has been drained after the successive closures of the breaches at Laogaozhai and Ruizhuangzi along the Jiyun Canal on August 30th and September 14th. The total area of the above five waterlogged areas is over 1.25 million mu. To date, 450,000 mu have been drained successively and can be fully planted with winter wheat this year. The remainder can be largely drained by next spring and planted with spring wheat. The masses in these areas are now saying, "The Jiyun Canal's illness has been cured this time."

　　蓟运河沿岸人民
    积极排除洼地积水种秋麦
    【本报讯】蓟运河在潮白河水挽入新道后，水位大为降低，使沿岸各洼积水排泄畅流，现已脱地约四十五万亩。可全部种上秋麦。这是潮白河新河道放水后，在蓟运河沿岸出现的新局面。蓟县的青甸、太和，玉田的林南仓，三河的红娘港，宝坻的大钟庄等积水洼，过去因连年积水，不能播种，自今夏潮白河水流挽入新道后，蓟运河水位大为降低，给各洼积水得以宣泄。现蓟县、玉田、三河、宝坻等县人民政府在蓟滦河务局的协助下，正积极大力组织排水。蓟县青甸洼，至九月十日已脱地一万七千亩。蓟县的太和与玉田的林南仓两洼，在八月二十五日堵复周河左堤莫庄子决口后，断绝了两洼水源，至九月十五日已脱地约两万亩。三河的红娘港，至九月十日已脱地十二万亩。宝坻的大钟庄洼，在八月三十日和九月十四日先后堵复蓟运河老高寨和芮庄子两决口后，已脱地十四万亩。以上五洼积水面积共一百二十五万余亩，至目前为止，现已陆续脱地四十五万亩，今年可全部种上秋麦，其余至明春可大部泄干，能种上春麦。现在这几个洼的群众说：“蓟运河的病这回可去根了”。
