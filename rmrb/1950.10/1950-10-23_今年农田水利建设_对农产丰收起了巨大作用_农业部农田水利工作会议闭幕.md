Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government convened a farmland water conservancy work conference in Beijing from the 8th to the 16th of this month. Fifty-two representatives from major administrative regions, the five provinces and two cities of North China, and relevant directly affiliated units of the Ministry of Agriculture attended. In addition to summarizing experience and discussing farmland water conservancy work for the coming year, the meeting focused on discussing issues related to farmland water conservancy irrigation management.

The meeting pointed out that this year's farmland water conservancy construction in our country has played a huge role in the bumper harvests in various regions. A total of 6,861,199 mu of new and restored farmland water conservancy projects and expanded farmland benefited area nationwide this year, and 29,532,741 mu of land benefited from improved and routinely maintained projects. This includes 71 large-scale canal projects, more than 156,000 small-scale canal and pond dam projects, 80,000 newly dug wells, 73,000 iron-wheeled waterwheels loaned out, more than 9,000 dragon bone waterwheels and windmills added and repaired, 186 artesian wells dug, and more than 2,500 pumping units added and modified (Editor's note: The above figures are statistics as of September of this year). In terms of irrigation management, some regions have initially reformed feudal irrigation management organizations this year, organized unified management agencies, stipulated reasonable water usage methods, reduced water disputes, and expanded irrigated areas. Hebei and Chahar provinces have also conducted typical investigations of irrigation management work in order to study further improvements in irrigation management issues.

The meeting believes that the reason why China's farmland water conservancy construction has achieved the above results in the past year is due to the joint efforts of governments at all levels and the people of various regions, and the active participation of the People's Liberation Army in the work. The experience of the past year has proven that mobilizing and organizing the masses to widely carry out farmland water conservancy work is currently the best way to spend less money, achieve great results, and achieve results quickly, and it plays the greatest role in agricultural production. However, in the work, various meetings must be held, organizational work must be done well, and reliance on the support of governments at all levels and the broad masses of the people is necessary to smoothly complete the tasks. At the same time, the establishment of specialized institutions is also a strong guarantee for organizing and promoting work.

The meeting pointed out that there are also some shortcomings in this year's farmland water conservancy work. Because most of the farmland water conservancy business departments at all levels were established not long ago and their institutions are not yet sound, there are still shortcomings in the work, such as hasty planning, neglect of irrigation management, and in leadership work, emphasis on deployment and calls, and lack of organization, leadership, and inspection. These shortcomings must be vigorously corrected in future work.

The meeting believes that the construction guidelines for farmland water conservancy in the coming year are: (1) widely mobilize mass small-scale farmland water conservancy projects; (2) continue to build canals with emphasis and develop waterwheel, well, and pumping irrigation and drainage projects; (3) encourage private investment in farmland water conservancy construction; (4) strengthen irrigation management, improve management institutions, and use water reasonably.

The meeting focused on discussing issues related to irrigation management, clearly stipulating that the management direction of irrigation work should be a democratic, centralized, and scientific management direction, and determined that in state-owned irrigation undertakings, we should first start to improve the basic management organizations of beneficiary household groups and village water conservancy committees, establish irrigation management regulations, and combine agricultural technology to achieve the goals of rational water use, soil improvement, and increased crop yields. At the same time, select key points for experimentation to serve as a demonstration for state-owned and mass-operated irrigation undertakings. For privately run irrigation undertakings, we should first improve their management organizations, gradually realize unified management, and pay attention to accumulating funds to improve engineering equipment.

　　今年农田水利建设
    对农产丰收起了巨大作用
    农业部农田水利工作会议闭幕
    【新华社十九日讯】中央人民政府农业部于本月八日至十六日在北京召开农田水利工作会议，出席者有各大行政区、华北五省两市及农业部有关直属单位代表五十二人。会议除总结经验和讨论明年度农田水利工作外，并着重讨论了农田水利灌溉管理问题。
    会议指出，今年我国农田水利的建设对各地农产的丰收起了巨大的作用，总计全国今年新建和恢复的农田水利工程与扩大农田受益面积六百八十六万一千一百九十九亩，整修及岁修工程改善受益面积二千九百五十三万二千七百四十一亩。其中包括大型渠道工程七十一处，小型渠道及塘坝工程十五万六千余处，新凿水井八万眼，贷出铁轮水车七万三千辆，增加及修复龙骨水车、风车九千余架，凿自流井一百八十六眼，添置及改装抽水机二千五百余部（本报编者按：以上各项数字系截至本年九月份统计）。在灌溉管理方面，部分地区今年已初步改造了封建的灌溉管理组织，组织了统一的管理机构，规定合理使水的办法，减少了用水纠纷，扩大了灌溉面积。河北、察哈尔两省还作了灌溉管理工作的典型调查，以便研究进一步的改善灌溉管理问题。
    会议认为：一年来我国农田水利建设能有以上成绩的原因，是由于各级人民政府及各地人民的共同努力，与人民解放军积极参加工作的结果。一年来的经验证明，发动组织群众广泛开展农田水利工作是目前用钱少、收效大和收效快的最好办法，在农业生产上所起的作用也最大。但在工作中必须通过各种会议，作好组织工作，依靠各级政府和广大群众的支持，才能顺利完成任务。同时，建立专业机构也是组织和推动工作的有力保证。
    会议指出，今年的农田水利工作也存在若干缺点，由于今年各级农田水利业务主管部门大多建立不久，机构尚不健全，故工作中还存在计划草率、忽视灌溉管理及在领导工作中偏重布置号召、缺乏组织领导检查等缺点，必须在今后工作中大力纠正。
    会议认为：明年度农田水利的建设方针是：（一）广泛发动群众性的小型农田水利工程；（二）继续有重点地兴建渠道，发展水车、水井及抽水机灌溉排水工程；（三）鼓励私人投资农田水利建设；（四）加强灌溉管理，改善管理机构，合理使水。
    会议曾着重讨论了灌溉管理方面问题，明确规定了灌溉工作的管理方向应该是民主的集中的、科学的管理方向，并确定在国营灌溉事业中，应先着手健全受益户小组及村水利委员会的基层管理组织，确立灌溉管理的规章，结合农业技术，以求达到合理用水、改良土壤及提高农产量的目的。同时选择重点，进行试验，以作为国营及群众合营灌溉事业的示范。对民办的灌溉事业，应先健全其管理组织，逐步实现统一的管理，并注意积累资金，以改善工程设备。
