　　Successfully Resolved Historical Drainage Dispute
　　80% of Water Drained from Qingyuan County
　　[This Newspaper’s Report] Qingyuan County, Hebei, has resolved a historical drainage dispute, resulting in successful damming and drainage work this year. During this year's flood season, breaches occurred in 86 tributaries of the Tang River and other four rivers in Qingyuan, resulting in 292,516 mu of accumulated water. Through emergency damming and drainage, as of September 25, the county had drained 248,760 mu of land, accounting for 84% of the flooded area. This provided a reliable guarantee for wheat planting in the flood-stricken areas. The following experiences were gained during this damming and drainage effort:
　　(1) First, the leadership conducted detailed surveys and research on the damming and drainage project, weighing the pros and cons, and resolutely proceeded. For example, Shenzhuang and Gaozhuang villages are located in the middle of three large river forks. One fork belongs to Gaozhuang, and two forks belong to Shenzhuang. Gaozhuang demanded that the river fork be blocked. If so, the water volume in Shenzhuang would increase. Shenzhuang then demanded that both river forks be blocked. In reality, the river channel could not accommodate such a large volume of water, which would inevitably lead to overflowing. In this situation, the Secretary of the County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party personally conducted a survey with the Shenzhuang village cadres, explaining the pros and cons and educating the village cadres. The village cadres also realized that if all the tributaries were blocked, overflowing would inevitably harm everyone. They then agreed to only block two river forks, and the dispute between the two villages was resolved.
　　(2) "The downstream obeys the upstream, and small interests obey the large interests" is the principle for resolving drainage disputes; however, appropriate consideration must be given to small interests; otherwise, it will be difficult to persuade the masses by only emphasizing that small interests must obey large interests. For example, regarding the damming issue between Gaozhuang and Shenzhuang, an agreement was reached after three attempts by the district, but it was overturned each time because the masses could not accept it. The main reason was that only the upstream and large interests were considered, while the downstream and small interests were not. The district cadres only emphasized that blocking the Gaozhuang opening would not cause much harm to Shenzhuang, but the Shenzhuang masses could not accept it, and the problem was delayed for ten days without resolution. Later, it was measured that the problem could be solved as long as each village blocked one opening. In this way, both villages would benefit, and the problem was then successfully resolved.
　　(3) After reaching an agreement on damming, signing a contract to ensure the implementation of the agreement is an effective way to resolve disputes. For example, regarding the historical dispute between Gao and Shen villages, the masses in both villages reached an agreement on damming and planting wheat. However, the Shenzhuang masses had concerns that it was only a verbal agreement, fearing that Gaozhuang would not implement the "guarantee to open the dam" the following year. Based on this situation, a written contract was later signed, with the names and signatures of the cadres responsible from the four villages, the county and the district, and each held a copy. Shenzhuang announced this contract at a meeting of cadres and the masses, and everyone said, "Now we have something to hold on to, and we must act according to the contract next year."

　　顺利解决历史性排水纠纷
    清苑县积水排出百分之八十
    【本报讯】河北清苑县解决了历史排水纠纷，使今年堵口排水工作获得了成绩。今年汛期清苑唐河等四条河流的支流决口达八十六处，积水二十九万二千五百一十六亩。经紧急堵口排水截止九月二十五日，全县已脱出土地二十四万八千七百六十亩，占积水面积百分之八十四。给水灾区的种麦工作，提供了可靠的保证。在这次堵口排水中获得了以下几点经验：
    （一）首先领导上对堵口排水工程进行详细勘察和研究，权衡利害，坚决进行。如申庄、高庄两村位于三条大河岔中间，一条河岔属高庄，两条河岔属申庄，高庄要求堵闭河岔，如是，申庄水量即会加大，申庄就要求把两条河岔都堵闭。这样河渠实际又不能容纳这么大的水量，势必又将漫决。在这种情况下，中共县委书记亲自偕同申庄村干部进行了勘查，说明利害，教育了村干部，村干部也认识到如将支流全堵死，势必漫决大家受害，乃同意只堵两个河岔，两村纠纷得以解决。
    （二）“下游服从上游，小利服从大利”，是解决排水纠纷的原则；但又必须注意适当照顾小利，否则专强调小利服从大利，群众思想很难打通。如高申两庄堵口问题，经区处理三次达成协议，均因群众接受不了而又推翻，主要原因是：只顾了上游和大利，而没有照顾到下游和小利，区干部只强调了堵上高庄口子，对申庄危害不大，但申庄群众不能接受，问题拖延十天不能解决。后经测量只要两庄各堵一口即行，这样两村都有利，于是问题顺利得到解决。
    （三）堵口达成协议后，订立合同，保证协议的执行是解决纠纷的有效办法。如高、申两庄历史纠纷问题，两村群众在堵口种麦一点上是取得了协议的，但申庄群众有顾虑，怕只是口头协议，深恐明年高庄不执行“保证扒开堵口”的规定，根据这一情况，后来订立了文字合同，四个村和县区负责干部都具名花押、各持一份。申庄在干群会上公布了这份合同，大家都说：“这样可有把柄了，明年一定按合同办事”。（马化民、晨光）
