　　Some Thoughts on National Day
    Liu Yunhai, Chief Driver, Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau
    The historically significant first National Day is the happiest day for our broad masses of people. We must celebrate it and commemorate it with boundless enthusiasm.
    This year's National Day is being celebrated by the people of the whole country under the leadership of Chairman Mao, with various victories achieved, and with the simultaneous convening in Beijing of the two representative conferences of national combat heroes and national labor models of workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    In this infinitely joyous festival, I would like to share a few of my thoughts. First, in this year, thanks to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the valiant fighting of the People's Liberation Army, we have liberated all the land except Taiwan and Tibet, enabling the broad masses of people to enjoy a democratic, free, happy, and stable life. Second, the Central People's Government has systematically adjusted industry and commerce, taxation, improved labor-management relations, curbed inflation, and stabilized prices, making it possible for the folks to exchange a few kilograms of cotton for a cartload of coal for burning. This has never happened before. This has raised and improved our living standards. Third, in the most difficult year of 1950, our railway workers implemented measures to protect the sick and disabled, solving various difficult problems in the birth, aging, illness, injury, and disability of employees, thereby enhancing and encouraging the workers' production enthusiasm and the spirit of creativity without fear of difficulties. Everyone reflected, "Since the Communist Party came, everything is taken care of thoughtfully; it is really different." In my opinion, these are the three major events done by the People's Government in the past year.
    Now, our working class has become the master of the country, not only leading production but also participating in government work. The conference of worker, peasant, and soldier labor models representatives currently being held in Beijing further demonstrates the state's emphasis and love for the working people.
    National model representatives came to Beijing to attend the meeting and met our beloved Chairman Mao. They exchanged combat and production experiences at the meeting, which I greatly admire. Comrade Representatives! This is a major event, I hope you can concentrate on the meeting, and we will be responsible for the affairs on-site and will never disappoint you. The higher authorities have already requested us to save 1,200 tons of coal in the coal-saving campaign to celebrate National Day. We are confident that we can successfully complete this call. I will definitely persuade and mobilize everyone to join this upsurge. At the same time, all employees of our section will also offer five days of accident-free operation as a gift! We are waiting for you to return from the meeting to learn from each other so as to advance the economic construction of the new China on the existing foundation. We congratulate Chairman Mao on his good health and the success of the conference with high enthusiasm and concern.

　　国庆节的几点感想
    石家庄机务段主任级司机  刘运海
    具有历史意义的第一个国庆日，是我们广大人民最快乐的一天。我们要以无限的热情来庆祝它，纪念它。
    今年的国庆是全国人民在毛主席的领导下，取得了各种胜利与全国战斗英雄、全国工农兵劳动模范两代表会议在京同时召开的情况下来庆祝的。
    在这个无限愉快的节日中，谈谈我的几点感想。第一、这一年中，由于毛主席的英明领导与人民解放军的英勇善战，我们已解放了除台湾、西藏以外的全部国土，使广大人民得到了民主自由快乐安定的生活。第二、中央人民政府有计划地调整工商业、税收，改善了劳资关系，制止了通货膨胀，平稳了物价，使得老乡们拿几斤棉花就可以换一车大煤烧。这是从前从未有过的事。这是提高和改善了我们的生活。第三、我们铁路职工在一九五○年最困难的一年中，实行了保护疾病伤残办法，解决了职工生、老、病、伤、残中的种种困难问题，因此也提高和鼓舞了工人的生产积极性和不怕困难的创造精神。大家反映说：“共产党来了，什么事都给照顾的周到，真是不一样。”在我看来，这是人民政府一年中所做的三件大事。
    现在，我们工人阶级成了国家的主人，不但领导生产，还可以参加政府工作。现在北京召开的工农兵劳模代表会议更说明了国家对劳动人民的重视和爱戴。
    全国英模代表到北京开会，见到了我们敬爱的毛主席，在会上交换了战斗和生产经验，使我非常羡慕。代表同志们！这是一件大事，希望你们安心开会，现场的事由我们负责，绝不使你们失望。上级已经要求我们在庆祝国庆的节煤运动中，节约煤一千二百吨。我们有信心能够胜利完成这个号召。我一定说服动员大家卷入这个热潮。同时，我段全体职工还以五日不出责任事故来作献礼呢！我们等待着你们开会回来互相学习，以便把新中国的经济建设在现有的基础上向前推进。我们以高度的热情和关切祝贺毛主席身体健康和大会的成功。
