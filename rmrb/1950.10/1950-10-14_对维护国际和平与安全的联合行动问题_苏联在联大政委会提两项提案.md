On the Question of Joint Action to Maintain International Peace and Security
    Soviet Union Submits Two Proposals at the UN General Assembly Political Committee
    Agreements on Armed Forces Should Be Negotiated by Major Powers Before Being Placed Under the Control of the Security Council; Actions Prescribed by the UN Charter Must Be Taken to Resolve International Disputes
    [Xinhua News Agency, New York, 12th] TASS, New York, 12th: The Political Committee of the UN General Assembly continued its debate on the seven-nation proposal for "United Action for Peace," submitted by the delegations of the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Turkey, the Philippines, France, and Uruguay, during its morning session on October 11.

    The Ecuadorian representative, Quevedo, spoke first, supporting the American proposal (the so-called seven-nation proposal), but stated that the proposal could be improved in several points.

    When discussing Section C of the seven-nation proposal (the section on establishing UN armed forces), Quevedo stated that he believed that such armed forces must be established on the basis of consultations with the relevant UN member states and in accordance with the constitutional procedures of the UN member states. He believed that Section "B" of the proposal, regarding the establishment of the so-called Collective Action Committee, must also be more clearly revised.

    In conclusion, Quevedo suggested a thorough study of the Chilean proposal so that some of the Chilean recommendations could be incorporated into the seven-nation proposal.

    The next speaker, the Iraqi representative, declared at the beginning of his speech that the General Assembly should constantly urge the major powers to seek agreement. He said that one should never refuse peace negotiations and the peaceful resolution of all conflicts. He said that the seven-nation proposal was a "roundabout" method of eliminating the principle of unanimity among the major powers in the UN Charter.

    He also said that the Iraqi delegation "in principle" supported the seven-nation proposal and would support it after making certain amendments to it. The Iraqi representative emphasized that he believed that the rules of the UN Charter were broad and flexible, and that any method of supporting peace and security could be found within it.

    He further said that the General Assembly must first find measures to avoid war, and that in this regard, it was particularly dependent on the mutual understanding and unanimous action of the major powers. He said that the Security Council should be advised to formulate agreements and measures to ensure that the Security Council could act effectively.

    Subsequently, the Abyssinian representative expressed support for the purpose of the seven-nation proposal, but he emphasized that the success of the UN's work depended primarily on the agreement of the major powers—the five permanent members of the Security Council—to take action. He suggested that the General Assembly should appeal to the major powers and advise them to reach agreement on all contentious issues.

    The Abyssinian representative reserved the right to make further comments on specific provisions during the paragraph-by-paragraph discussion of the proposal.

    In the course of the session, the Soviet delegation submitted two proposals for consideration by the Political Committee. The first proposal was as follows: "The General Assembly, recognizing the particular importance of the unanimous action of the five permanent members of the Security Council in defending and strengthening international peace and security, recommends that, before armed forces are placed at the disposal of the Security Council pursuant to appropriate agreements concluded under Article 43 of the Charter, the five permanent members of the Security Council—the USSR, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and France—should take steps to ensure the fulfillment of Article 106 of the Charter, which provides for consultations among them; and that they should consult jointly in accordance with Article 106 above in order to take joint action on behalf of the Organization that may prove necessary for the maintenance of international peace and security."

    The second Soviet proposal was as follows:

    "In order to maintain international peace and security in accordance with the United Nations Charter, and in particular in accordance with Chapters V, VI, and VII of the Charter, the General Assembly recommends to the Security Council that it take the necessary steps to ensure that, in the event of any threat to peace or the declaration of an act of aggression, action is taken as provided for in the Charter, and that peaceful solutions are sought to disputes and situations that may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security. The Security Council shall determine the measures to be taken to implement rapidly Articles 43, 45, 46, and 47 of the United Nations Charter regarding the placing of armed forces of United Nations Member States at the disposal of the Security Council, and to make the Military Staff Committee function effectively."

    The next speaker was the Canadian representative, Pearson, who attempted to refute the comments made by the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, regarding certain recommendations in the American proposal, but he limited himself to general statements, saying that the principle of unanimity among the major powers in the Security Council had "paralyzed" the Security Council, that the Korean conflict showed the need to strengthen the United Nations, and that the seven-nation proposal did not go beyond the UN Charter.

    The Canadian representative fully supported the seven-nation proposal. Pearson avoided detailed discussion of the two proposals submitted by the Soviet delegation on October 11, although he said that the Canadian delegation could support some of the suggestions in the proposals. He also refused to consider the Chilean proposal. He said that he would discuss the proposal in detail during further discussion of the issue.

    The Egyptian representative and the Philippine representative spoke at the end of the meeting, also supporting the seven-nation proposal. The Philippine representative, Romulo, supported the Soviet proposal for consultations between the five permanent members of the Security Council. However, Romulo said that it must be explained under what conditions the major powers should demonstrate that they could reach an agreement.

    The morning session adjourned at this point.

    The Political Committee's afternoon session continued to discuss the "Collective Measures for Maintaining Peace" issue, focusing on the seven-nation proposal and the Chilean proposal.

    The Pakistani representative, Zafrulla, spoke in support of the American proposal. The Indian representative, Rau, said that India would not express its attitude towards the American proposal until it was amended, as the facts showed that the proposal would be amended. Rau then criticized Section A of the American proposal as being ambiguous. In conclusion, he reserved the right to express a general attitude towards the Chilean and American proposals. The Syrian representative, El-Ghouri, welcomed the "objectives of the American proposal," but said that the Syrian delegation could not accept the section of the proposal that stipulated that a special session of the General Assembly could be convened at the request of any seven members of the Security Council, because this section of the proposal "clearly violates the Charter." El-Ghouri expressed the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union could resolve their differences, and pointed out that there were other ways to resolve differences besides war. The next speaker, the Norwegian representative, Lange, supported the American proposal. The Lebanese representative, Takla, suggested making some minor changes to the wording of the American proposal. The New Zealand representative, Doki, supported the American proposal.

　　对维护国际和平与安全的联合行动问题
    苏联在联大政委会提两项提案
    武装部队协定交安理会支配前应先由大国协商必须采取联合国宪章规定的行动解决国际争端
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社纽约十二日讯：联大政治委员会在十月十一日上午会议中继续辩论美、加、英、土、菲、法、乌（拉圭）七国代表团所提的“保障和平的联合行动”案。
    厄瓜多尔代表奎维铎首先发言，支持美国的提案（所谓七国提案），但表示该提案在若干点上可加改进。
    奎维铎论述七国提案中的丙段（关于成立联合国武装部队的一段）时，表示认为必须在与有关的联合国会员国会谈的基础上，并按照联合国会员国的宪法程序，成立这种武装部队。他认为也必须更明确地校订提案中关于成立所谓集体行动委员会的“乙”段。
    奎维铎在结语中建议彻底研究智利的提案，以便把智利的若干建议列入七国提案中。
    接着发言的伊拉克代表在其演说的开始时便声言，大会应该不断地敦促大国觅取协议。他说，一个人应该永远不拒绝和平谈判与和平解决一切冲突。他说：七国提案是取消联合国宪章中大国一致的原则的“迂回”方法。
    他并说，伊拉克代表团“在原则上”赞成七国提案，并将在这一提案作某些修正后予以支持。伊拉克代表强调说，他认为联合国宪章的规则是广泛而且有伸缩性的，任何支持和平与安全的方法都可以在其中找到。
    他进一步说，大会首先必须找到避免战争的措施，在这一点上，尤其要依赖大国相互间的谅解和协议一致的行动。他说，应该劝告安理会制订协议的、保证安理会得以有效行动的措施。
    随后阿比西尼亚代表表示赞成七国提案的宗旨，然而他强调说，联合国工作的成功首先要依赖大国——安理会五个常任理事国——协议的行动。他建议大会应该向大国呼吁并且忠告它们对于一切发生争执的问题获致协议。
    阿比西尼亚代表保留在逐段讨论提案时对具体条款作进一步评论的权利。
    在大会进程中，苏联代表团提出两项提案供政治委员会审议。第一项提案如下：“大会公鉴：考虑到在保卫和加强国际和平与安全中安理会五常任理事国一致行动的特别重要性，特建议：在武装部队依据按宪章第四十三条而缔结的相当协定，交由安理会支配以前，安理会五常任理事国——苏、美、英、中、法——应该采取步骤，以保证履行必须履行的宪章第一○六条，该条规定它们间进行协商；并且它们应该遵照宪章中上述第一○六条共同协商，以便代表该组织采取可能证明为维持国际和平与安全所必要的联合行动”。
    苏联第二项提案如下：
    “为了依照联合国宪章，特别是依照宪章第五、第六和第七章以维持国际和平和安全，大会向安全理事会建议：在采取必要步骤，以保证如遇和平受到任何威胁或宣布有侵略行为时，务必采取宪章所规定的行动，并求得和平解决可能威胁国际和平与安全之维持的争端与情势。安全理事会应决定各项措施，以求迅速实施联合国宪章关于联合国会员国将武装部队交由安全理事会支配的第四十三、四十五、四十六和四十七条，并使军事参谋团作有效活动”。
    继起发言者为加拿大代表皮尔逊，他企图反驳苏联代表团团长维辛斯基关于美国提案中某些建议的评论，但他仅仅限于作一般的陈述，说什么安理会中大国一致的原则“瘫痪”了安理会，朝鲜冲突表明了有加强联合国的必要，而且还说什么七国提案并未超乎联合国宪章之外。
    加拿大代表完全支持七国提案。皮尔逊避免详细讨论苏联代表团在十月十一日提出的两项提案，虽然他说，加拿大代表团可以支持这一提案中的有些建议。他并拒绝考虑智利的提案。他说，他将在进一步讨论这一问题时详论这一提案。
    埃及代表与菲律宾代表在会议结束时发言，也支持七国提案。菲律宾代表罗慕洛则支持苏联关于安理会五位常任理事进行协商的提案。但罗慕洛说，必须说明大国应当表明它们能在何种条件下达到协议。
    上午会议于此休会。
    政治委员会下午会议继续就七国提案和智利提案讨论“维护和平的集体措施问题”。
    巴基斯坦代表查佛鲁拉发言支持美国的提案。印度代表劳氏说，印度在美国提案修正之前，对该提案将不表明态度，因为事实显示该提案会有所修正。劳氏继而批评美国提案中的甲项为含糊其词。在结语时，他保留对智利的和美国的提案表示一般态度的权利。叙利亚代表埃尔——古里欢迎“美国提案的目标”，但又说，叙利亚代表团不能接受提案中规定得在安理会任何七理事国请求下召开联大特别会议的一段，因为提案的这一段“彰明昭著地违犯宪章”。埃尔——古里表示希望美国与苏联能够解决分歧，并指出，要解决分歧，除战争外，还有其他方法。继起发言的挪威代表兰基支持美国的提案。黎巴嫩代表塔克拉建议将美国提案的措词作若干小的更改。新西兰代表多基支持美国提案。
