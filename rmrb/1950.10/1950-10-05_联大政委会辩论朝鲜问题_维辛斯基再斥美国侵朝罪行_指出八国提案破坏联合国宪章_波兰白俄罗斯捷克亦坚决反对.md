Xinhua News Agency, New York, 3rd (TASS): On October 2nd, the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly resumed its debate on the eight-nation proposal, which attempts to promote a "solution" to the Korean War on terms clearly dictated by the American interventionists.

Soviet Representative Vyshinsky Speaks
　　The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, spoke first. He pointed out that the speech made by the American representative, Austin, on September 30th was a distortion of the facts; Austin, in that speech, attempted to shift the responsibility for the Korean incident onto the Soviet Union. Vyshinsky said that, as Austin stated, there were instances of violating the principles of the United Nations in the Korean incident, and tracing back to the source, it can be known that this was due to the United States' refusal to implement the 1945 Anglo-American-Soviet agreement, which stipulated the establishment of a unified, independent, and democratic Korea, and which had been confirmed by the Council of Foreign Ministers.
　　Vyshinsky pointed out: The Moscow Agreement on Korea stipulated that in establishing an independent, democratic, and unified regime, consultation should be held with various democratic parties and people's organizations in Korea. However, the United States refused to consult with organizations such as the National Council of Korean Labor Unions and the National Federation of Farmers' Associations. The United States preferred to consult with seventeen organizations that opposed the Three-Power Agreement. On the other hand, the United States only agreed to consult with three organizations that supported the Moscow Agreement.
　　Vyshinsky said that, in this way, the American representatives had exposed the direction of American foreign policy as early as 1946, 1947, and 1948. This is how the United States violated the fundamental principles of the Moscow Agreement itself. Austin and the sponsors of the eight-nation proposal argue that they advocate establishing a unified, independent, and democratic Korea, but the proposal stipulates that the establishment of the regime should be consulted with the "Unified Command," which is tantamount to saying that they should accept the orders of the command.
　　What kind of "democracy" would result from such a practice? The best answer can be obtained by judging from the elections in South Korea under American supervision. In this election, democratic rights were brutally trampled upon, and even the United Nations Commission on Korea, which was biased and lacked objectivity, could not completely conceal these facts. Large numbers of democratic leaders in the South Korean region were arrested, and democratic organizations were persecuted. These measures were specifically aimed at those organizations that had openly supported the Three-Power decision on establishing a democratic, independent, and unified Korea. The Soviet representative in the Soviet-American Commission had firmly insisted on normalizing the situation, and believed that otherwise, the commission could not work to fulfill the Moscow Agreement.
　　The Soviet Union believes that the Moscow Agreement is still binding on the United States. The United States obviously has another idea. However, before recklessly accusing others of "violating principles," the American representative should first recall the true history of the Korean issue.
　　Vyshinsky pointed out that the Syngman Rhee clique's unbridled terror against democrats during the 1950 South Korean elections violated all basic democratic principles. He declared: In the atmosphere of terror that existed at the time, free elections were impossible. Syngman Rhee's police terror naturally aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. Vyshinsky pointed out that even the United Nations Commission on Korea had acknowledged Syngman Rhee's terror and the deteriorating economic situation in South Korea. Vyshinsky, in discussing the disastrous financial situation in South Korea, pointed out the corruption of the Syngman Rhee clique, and declared that the financial situation was deteriorating due to the masses' refusal to pay illegal taxes. He pointed out that the so-called "land reform" had failed to solve the land problem and had failed to relieve the suffering of the South Korean people. The Syngman Rhee clique attempted to suppress the growing dissatisfaction of the masses with barbaric acts of violence. Vyshinsky further emphasized that the United States gave full support to the fascist Syngman Rhee clique. He declared that although the United Nations Commission on Korea had attempted to "whitewash" the situation in South Korea, the commission had to acknowledge the terror inflicted by the Syngman Rhee clique on any opposition and the suppression of basic democratic rights. He also pointed out that the commission acknowledged that 70 percent of Syngman Rhee's candidates had failed in the 1950 elections, despite the large-scale arrests and terror.
　　Vyshinsky declared that the repression and terror of the Syngman Rhee clique had caused the current civil war in Korea. He further pointed out that the Syngman Rhee clique, while oppressing the people of South Korea, was also preparing to attack North Korea. The Syngman Rhee clique rejected all efforts for the peaceful unification of Korea, issued inflammatory statements, and made it clear that it would attack North Korea. During this preparation, the Syngman Rhee clique bloodily suppressed the guerrillas in South Korea, thereby attempting to prepare the "domestic front."
　　Vyshinsky quoted statements made by Syngman Rhee that revealed the aggressive plans of the Syngman Rhee fascist puppet clique, including a letter from Syngman Rhee to American professor Oliver (this letter had been seized by the North Koreans), which expressed the hope that Washington would allow the Syngman Rhee clique to invade North Korea.
　　Vyshinsky cited many statements and documents to show that the Syngman Rhee clique, under the command of their American masters, had intensified preparations for more than a year before launching an attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He recounted that the President of the United Nations General Assembly and the Secretary-General of the United Nations had received notifications from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea showing that the American Ambassador to the Syngman Rhee clique, Muccio, had summoned the head of the American military mission and Syngman Rhee's officials as early as the summer of 1949, and had instructed them to implement "domestic security" measures in July and August 1949—carrying out large-scale arrests to destroy opposition to launching an attack on North Korea.
　　American General Roberts drafted a plan for these measures and supervised its implementation. As a result, hundreds and thousands of villages were destroyed, and 400,000 families were ruined, simply because these residents were suspected of sympathizing with the guerrillas. Other documents showed that Syngman Rhee's officials had completed plans to transfer naval and air force bases to the United States as soon as military operations began, and had also prepared plans in advance to destroy factories, railways, bridges, and murder the leaders of the North Korean people. At the same time, countless incidents were organized along the 38th parallel. This spring, Syngman Rhee explicitly stated that the time for launching aggression was approaching. At that time, he said that May and June would be the most urgent two months in Korean history. Vyshinsky emphasized that that was when Dulles visited Korea. He could be seen in photographs standing in the trenches. He also cited Dulles's remarks on June 19th about America's willingness to support the "struggle against communism."
　　Vyshinsky then pointed out that military preparations had intensified, and by May 1950, American military advisors said that everything was ready in South Korea. Vyshinsky said that these facts are known to everyone, but one fact is particularly significant. The North Koreans seized a strategic map in the archives of the Syngman Rhee gang. This map depicted the entire plan for South Korea's attack on North Korea. After describing this map in detail, Vyshinsky said that from these facts, it can be known who the real criminals are, and the American claim that North Korea committed "aggression" is completely refuted. The American fabrication of the situation and this distortion of facts have caused various UN agencies to violate the Charter. The use of such ignorant methods to treat facts must be stopped. The concept of aggression has never been applied to civil war. The principles of international law and international practice prohibit foreign intervention in civil war; however, some representatives want to disregard international law.
　　Vyshinsky cited the facts of the American Civil War of 1860-1865. In that war, Britain had attempted to illegally help the slave owners in the South. He asked whether Austin would have welcomed British intervention at that time. He also cited Louis Napoleon's intervention in the Mexican Civil War in 1860. He recounted that the United States at that time had strongly condemned France's actions and forcible intervention in Mexico's internal affairs.
　　Vyshinsky declared that aggression is when one country attacks another, and any country that forcibly intervenes in the internal strife of another country is committing aggression. Vyshinsky said that in Chapters 6 and 7 of the United Nations Charter, no one can find a basis for interpreting civil war as aggression. The Korean conflict is a civil war, but when the United States forcibly intervened in the Korean War to help the reactionaries favored by American monopoly capitalists, the American intervention transformed the war into another kind of war.
　　At this point, Vyshinsky said that Austin insisted that the 38th parallel was merely a fiction and did not demarcate anything, which is tacitly acknowledging that there are no international boundaries there. Vyshinsky asked: If there are no international boundaries, how can the Charter be invoked as a pretext for intervening in the struggle between two sides within a country?
　　Vyshinsky emphasized that there are only two government camps in Korea, and they are both temporary. Vyshinsky reiterated that any attempt to apply the provisions of the Charter concerning the prevention of "aggression" is arbitrary and violates all standards of international law.
　　Vyshinsky then pointed out that the measures taken by the Security Council on June 25 and 27, and July 27, in blatant violation of the Charter, were merely attempts to cover up the shameful American intervention in Korea with the guise of the United Nations. To carry out this trick, the United States used pressure on those countries that are economically dependent on the United States, telling them that if they did not support the "United Nations" illegal resolutions on Korea, they would stop issuing funds for the Marshall Plan.
　　Vyshinsky continued that the eight-nation proposal currently submitted to the Political Committee wantonly undermines the United Nations Charter, and its intention is to conceal the illegal act of American aggression against Korea and to justify further American occupation of Korea.
　　In conclusion, Vyshinsky said that the Soviet delegation will vote against the eight-nation proposal because it is completely unacceptable, and the Soviet delegation will submit its own proposal, or will jointly submit a proposal with other delegations.
　　Vyshinsky continued that the Soviet Union will also submit a proposal suggesting that the General Assembly demand a cessation of bombing undefended cities in violation of the Hague Convention. Vyshinsky said that the Soviet delegation will also strongly urge the dissolution of the United Nations Commission on Korea because it can neither fulfill its duties nor violate the United Nations Charter.
　　Following Vyshinsky, the representative of the Syngman Rhee clique, the so-called "Foreign Minister" Lim Byung-jik, spoke, attempting to portray the corrupt Syngman Rhee puppet gang as a "democratic government" and as representing the Korean people. Lim Byung-jik also made special slanders against the Soviet Union and the democratic elements of Korea. The morning meeting of the Political Committee then adjourned.
　　The afternoon meeting continued the debate on the Korean issue.
　　Polish Representative Speaks
　　The first speaker, Polish representative Wierblowski, stated that despite the efforts of the supporters of the eight-nation proposal to avoid the substance of the issue and to create confusion with ulterior debates, the committee must not ignore the fact that the United States is attempting to obstruct, while the Soviet Union is attempting to promote, the decision of the major powers on establishing a unified, democratic, and independent Korea. Although the Korean issue is undoubtedly not within the jurisdiction of the United Nations, the United States has brought it to the United Nations General Assembly in the hope of achieving its own political goals. The decisions taken by the General Assembly in the past have not only failed to help establish an independent and democratic Korea, but have instead facilitated the outbreak of war in Korea.
　　After recounting that the Polish delegation had emphasized in the previous two sessions of the General Assembly the harmful consequences of the General Assembly's decision to establish the so-called Commission on Korea, Wierblowski stated that the commission's recent report is unique in the history of United Nations documents because there is a sharp contradiction between the facts it reveals and its conclusions. Like a mirror, the report reflects the barbaric terror of the Syngman Rhee regime, but does not condemn it.
　　In order to illustrate how the Syngman Rhee clique intensified terror to maintain its precarious rule, Wierblowski also cited newspaper reports stating that the number of political prisoners in South Korea was 10,000 in September 1947, and increased to 32,000 two years later. He also said that in the first four months of 1950, 32,000 people were arrested.
　　Wierblowski cited an eyewitness account published in Life magazine on December 15, 1948, regarding the barbaric terror of the Syngman Rhee police, where police killed Koreans in front of their wives and children while conducting "loyalty investigations."
　　Wierblowski stated that the Security Council had failed to fulfill its responsibility to promote a peaceful resolution, and instead did everything possible to aggravate the conflict and spread a smokescreen to cover up American military actions. Wierblowski expressed regret that the Security Council had failed to take action on many urgent appeals. Among these appeals was a telegram from the Polish government urging the Security Council to prompt the United States to cease the indiscriminate and brutal bombing by the US Air Force in violation of the Hague Convention, which has resulted in the large-scale massacre of peaceful Korean residents and the devastating destruction of property. In conclusion, Wierblowski pointed out that although stopping the war and withdrawing foreign troops must be achieved first in accordance with the obligations stipulated in the Charter, the British proposal ignores these basic prerequisites for a peaceful solution and attempts to seek a solution that is contrary to the Charter. The British proposal attempts to use the authority of the United Nations to cover up American intervention and attempts to preserve the terrorist Syngman Rhee clique's control over the Korean people.
　　Wierblowski warned that if the British proposal is adopted, it will make the United Nations General Assembly an accomplice in enslaving the Korean people. He said that therefore, the Polish delegation will vote against the entire proposal.
　　Belarus Representative Speaks
　　Belarus representative Kiselev pointed out that the United Nations Commission on Korea's report attempts to blame the North Korean people for the Korean conflict. He declared that therefore, this report is intended to attack the entire Korean people in order for the United States to occupy Korea. Therefore, this report is bound to distort the facts in every possible way. The whole world knows that the war in Korea was launched by the Syngman Rhee clique.
　　Kiselev cited various newspapers that described the Syngman Rhee clique's war-mongering and aggressive plans. He pointed out that The New York Times published a cable on June 26 from its correspondent in Korea, Sullivan, in which Sullivan quoted a speech made by Syngman Rhee in March 1950; in this speech, Syngman Rhee said that his troops could attack the North Koreans as soon as Washington "gave the signal."
　　Kiselev said that the proposal submitted by the eight countries to the Political Committee also wants to justify foreign intervention in Korea and worsen the situation in Korea. The proposal seeks to "sanctify" the illegal resolutions of the Security Council.
　　Commenting on these illegal resolutions, Kiselev pointed out that the members of the Security Council who approved these resolutions refused to consider any possible actions to restore peace in Korea. Kiselev said that the use of the United Nations flag in Korea by the interveners has caused great shame to the United Nations. He said that it is clear that the purpose of the intervention in Korea is only to promote the interests of the interveners, but it is completely contrary to the principles of the United Nations Charter.
　　Kiselev denounced the barbaric actions of the military interveners in Korea, and pointed out that the documents published by the North Korean side provided indisputable facts proving that the aggressors violated the Hague Convention and relevant regulations.
　　Kiselev declared that the United Nations can only truly fulfill its obligations by finding a way to peacefully resolve the Korean War in accordance with the Charter.
　　Czech Representative Speaks
　　The next speaker was Czech representative Siroky; he opposed the eight-nation proposal because this proposal stipulates that the entire Korea should be occupied by the American interventionists, thus depriving the Korean people of their inalienable right to self-determination.
　　Siroky expressed regret that the Political Committee refused to listen to the opinions of the true representatives of the Korean people, and only discussed this issue based on the "information" provided by the Syngman Rhee regime. Although the United Nations Commission on Korea is inherently biased, its report shows that the Syngman Rhee regime is determined not to compromise with North Korea in any way.
　　Siroky then cited many documents showing that Syngman Rhee had long been preparing to launch a war against North Korea. Siroky also emphasized that, along with these war preparations, there were various provocations, such as Syngman Rhee declaring in front of Dulles on June 19 that if "democracy cannot be defended with the Cold War," it will be achieved with a real war.
　　Siroky pointed out that the Security Council's attempt to justify the American intervention is illegal and was taken in the absence of two permanent members of the Security Council. Siroky then pointed out that the first condition for a peaceful resolution is the withdrawal of intervention troops.
　　When Siroky mentioned Acheson and Austin denying that the United States had strategic goals in Korea, he said that if they are willing to prove this, it is very easy, that is, to withdraw American troops.
　　Siroky then described the suffering and poverty of the South Korean people under the inflation caused by the policies of the Syngman Rhee clique, and cited the views of the Neue Zürcher Zeitung that Syngman Rhee attempted to avoid complete bankruptcy by launching a war of aggression.
　　Siroky also said that the Korean people's hatred of the Syngman Rhee regime that oppressed them has been acknowledged by many American newspapers, including the New York Herald Tribune. The newspaper described South Korea as an American protectorate, which would immediately collapse without American protection. Siroky emphasized that the elections in May strongly showed the people's resistance to Syngman Rhee. As a result of that election, Syngman Rhee was unable to obtain a majority. This proves that Syngman Rhee can only survive with the help of American bayonets.
　　Siroky continued that the Czech people understand the Korean people's hatred and contempt for the Syngman Rhee government that sold out the country to foreign interventionists, because the Czech people also had their own Syngman Rhee—such as the pro-Nazi collaborators like Hacha. Despite all this, the sponsors of the eight-nation proposal still demanded that the Syngman Rhee regime be imposed on all the Korean people. The Czechoslovak delegation cannot agree to this proposal, which attempts to subject the Korean people to American occupation and attempts to deprive the Korean people of their right to self-determination. Siroky pointed out that Czechoslovakia will second the Soviet proposal aimed at enabling the Korean people to democratically decide their own future and seeking a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue.
　　The last speaker was South African representative Jost. In a brief speech, he expressed his support for the eight-nation proposal.

　　联大政委会辩论朝鲜问题
    维辛斯基再斥美国侵朝罪行
    指出八国提案破坏联合国宪章
    波兰白俄罗斯捷克亦坚决反对
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约三日电：十月二日，联合国大会政治委员会恢复了对八国提案的辩论，这个提案企图以显然是美国干涉者指示的条件来促进朝鲜战事的“解决”。
    苏代表维辛斯基发言
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基首先发言。他指出美国代表奥斯汀在九月三十日的演说是歪曲事实；奥斯汀在那次演说中企图将朝鲜事件的责任转嫁在苏联身上。维辛斯基说，正如奥斯汀所说，在朝鲜事件中有违反联合国原则的情事，追根溯源，即可知道这是由于美国拒绝实行一九四五年的英美苏协定所致，该协定规定建立统一、独立与民主的朝鲜，并已由外长会议所确认。
    维辛斯基指出：关于朝鲜的莫斯科协定规定，在建立独立、民主与统一的政权时，须和朝鲜各民主党派和人民团体协商。然而，美国拒绝和朝鲜劳动组合全国评议会，全国农民组合总联盟等团体协商。美国倒宁愿与十七个反对三强协定的团体协商，另一方面，美国只答应与那些支持莫斯科协定的团体中的三个团体协商。
    维辛斯基说，就这样，美国代表早在一九四六、四七和四八几年就暴露了美国外交政策的方向。这就是美国违反了莫斯科协定基本原则本身。奥斯汀和八国提案的发起人争辩说，他们主张建立统一、独立与民主的朝鲜，但是提案却规定建立政权时和“统一司令部”协商，这无非是说要接受司令部的命令。
    这样做法结果会产生怎样的“民主”呢？从美国监督下的南朝鲜选举来判断，就可以得到最好的答案。在这个选举中，民主权利遭受到残酷的摧残，甚至偏私和缺乏客观态度的联合国朝鲜委员会也不能完全掩饰这些事实。南朝鲜地区的民主领袖们大批遭逮捕，民主团体受到迫害。这种措施专门用来对付那些曾公开支持关于建立民主、独立、统一的朝鲜的三国决定的团体。苏美委员会内的苏联代表曾坚主使情况正常化，并认为否则委员会即不可能为履行莫斯科协定而工作。
    苏联认为，莫斯科协定对美国仍有约束力。美国则显然作另一想法。但是，美国代表奥斯汀在胡乱指责别人“违反原则”之前，应该首先回忆一下朝鲜问题的真正历史。
    维辛斯基指出李承晚集团在一九五○年南朝鲜选举期间对民主分子进行的肆无忌惮的恐怖，违犯了所有基本民主原则。他宣称：在当时存在的恐怖情况下，自由选举是不可能的。李承晚的警察恐怖自然在群众中间引起了不满。维辛斯基指出：甚至联合国朝鲜委员会都曾承认李承晚的恐怖以及南朝鲜恶化的经济情况。维辛斯基在谈论南朝鲜的灾难性的财政情况时指出李承晚集团的贪污腐化，并宣称：由于人民大众拒缴不正当的捐税，财政情况愈形恶化。他指出：所谓“土地改革”并未能解决土地问题，也未能解除南朝鲜人民的痛苦。李承晚集团试图以野蛮的暴力行动来镇压人民大众日益增长的不满。维辛斯基进一步强调称：美国予法西斯李承晚集团以充分支持。他宣称：虽然联合国朝鲜委员会试图“粉饰”南朝鲜的局面，但这个委员会也不得不承认李承晚集团对任何的反对派所施的恐怖以及对基本民主权利所施的压制。他并指出：委员会承认，李承晚的候选人百分之七十在一九五○年选举中都归于失败，虽然曾进行了大批的逮捕与恐怖。
    维辛斯基宣称：李承晚集团的镇压与恐怖引起了目前在朝鲜发生的内战。他进一步指出：李承晚集团一方面压迫南朝鲜的人民，同时又准备对北朝鲜进行攻击。李承晚集团拒绝了对和平统一朝鲜的一切努力，发出煽动性的言论，并明白表示要攻击北朝鲜。在这个准备期间，李承晚集团血腥地镇压南朝鲜的游击队，而企图由此准备好“国内战线”。
    维辛斯基引述李承晚所发表的表明李承晚法西斯傀儡集团的侵略计划的声明，其中包括李承晚致美国教授奥利伏的一封信（这封信已被北朝鲜人缴获），这封信表示希望华盛顿方面允许李承晚集团侵略北朝鲜。
    维辛斯基引用许多声明与文件，说明李承晚集团在他们的美国主子的指挥下，在对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发动攻击之前，曾加紧进行准备达一年以上。他追述说，联合国大会主席及联合国秘书长曾接到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的通知书，显示美国驻李承晚集团大使缪锡俄早在一九四九年夏季就曾召见美国军事使团团长及李承晚的官员们，并且训令他们在一九四九年七八两月间实施“国内保安”措施——进行了大批逮捕，以摧毁对发动进攻北朝鲜的反对。
    美国的罗伯茨将军为这种措施拟订计划并监督其实现。结果，成百成千的村庄被毁灭了，四十万家庭被破坏了，就因为这些居民们有同情游击队的嫌疑。其他的文件显示：李承晚的官员们已经完成了计划，预备一俟军事行动开始，就将海空军基地移交给美国，同时也预先拟订了破坏工厂、铁路、桥梁及杀害北朝鲜人民领袖的计划。同时还沿着三八线有组织地制造了无数次的事件。今年春天，李承晚曾露骨地表示发动侵略的时间就要到临。当时他说：五月和六月将是朝鲜历史上最紧急的两个月。维辛斯基强调地指出：那就是杜勒斯访问朝鲜的时候。从照片上可以看见他站在战壕里面。他并援引杜勒斯在六月十九日提到的关于美国愿意支援“反对共产主义的斗争”的一段话。
    维辛斯基随即指出：军事准备工作加紧了，到一九五○年五月，美国军事顾问说：在南朝鲜什么都准备好了。维辛斯基说：这些事实是大家都知道的，但有一件事实特别显著。北朝鲜人在李承晚伙帮的档案中缴获了一幅战略地图。这幅地图绘出了南朝鲜进攻北朝鲜的计划的全貌。维辛斯基在详细地描述了这幅地图以后说：从这些事实里面就可以知道谁是真正的罪犯，而美国认为北朝鲜犯了“侵略”罪的这种说法就完全被推翻了。美国谎报事件的情况，这种歪曲事实的作法引起联合国各种机构的违犯宪章的行为。必须停止使用这种愚昧的办法来对待事实。侵略的概念从来不曾应用在内战上。国际法的原则和国际惯例都禁止外国干涉内战；但是，某些代表们却想不顾国际法。
    维辛斯基援引了一八六○——一八六五年的美国内战的事实。在那次战争中，英国曾企图非法地帮助南部的奴隶主。他问奥斯汀那时是否也会欢迎英国的干涉。他并举出路易拿破仑在一八六○年曾干预墨西哥的内战。他追述称：那时美国曾痛斥法国的行动以及强力干预墨西哥内政的行为。
    维辛斯基宣称，侵略乃是一个国家攻击另一个国家，并且凡一国强行干涉他国内争时，就是进行侵略。维辛斯基说：在联合国宪章第六、七两章任何人都找不到可把内战解释为侵略的根据。朝鲜冲突是内战，但是当美国强行干涉朝鲜战争来帮助美国垄断资本家所宠爱的反动派时，美国的干涉就把这次战争转变为另一种战争了。
    至此，维辛斯基说：奥斯汀坚称三八线不过是虚构的，并不划分什么，这就是默认无所谓国际疆界存在其间。维辛斯基问道：既没有国际疆界，如何能引用宪章来作为对一国国内双方的斗争进行干涉的口实呢？
    维辛斯基着重指出：在朝鲜仅有两个政府阵营，它们都是临时的。维辛斯基重申：想应用宪章上有关预防“侵略”的条款的任何企图都是武断的并且违反了国际法的一切标准。
    维辛斯基于是指出：安全理事会在六月二十五和二十七，及七月二十七日公然违反宪章而采取的措施不过是企图借联合国的外衣来遮盖可耻的美国在朝鲜的干涉而已。为执行这个诡计，美国对那些在经济上依赖美国的国家使用压力，告诉它们如果不支持“联合国”关于朝鲜的非法决议，就停止发给马歇尔计划的经费。
    维辛斯基继称，目前提交政治委员会的八国提案横暴地破坏了联合国宪章，其用意是要掩饰美国侵略朝鲜的非法行为和替美国进一步占领朝鲜辩护。
    维辛斯基在结语中称，苏联代表团将投票反对八国提案，因为它是完全不能接受的，苏联代表团将提出它自己的提案，或者将与其他代表团联合提出提案。
    维辛斯基继称，苏联也将提出提案，建议大会要求制止违反海牙公约派机轰炸不设防的城市。维辛斯基称，苏联代表团并将力促解散联合国朝鲜委员会，因为它既不能履行职责又违犯了联合国宪章。
    继维辛斯基之后发言的是李承晚集团的代表，所谓“外交部长”林炳稷，他企图把腐败的李承晚傀儡伙帮描画成“民主政府”而且是代表朝鲜人民的。林炳稷并对苏联及朝鲜的民主分子进行特别的诽谤，政治委员会上午会议随即休会。
    下午会议继续关于朝鲜问题的辩论。
    波兰代表发言
    第一位发言者波兰代表威尔勃洛夫斯基声称，尽管八国提案的支持者努力要避免问题的实质并且要以别有用心的辩论来造成混乱，委员会绝不能忽略这个事实，即美国企图阻挠而苏联却企图促成大国关于建立统一的民主的独立的朝鲜的决定。虽然朝鲜问题无疑地不是属于联合国管辖范围以内，然而美国把它向联合国大会提出，以期达到它本身的政治目的。大会过去所采取的决定不但无助于建立独立的民主的朝鲜，反而有利于促成在朝鲜爆发的战争。
    在追述了波兰代表团曾在以前两届大会上强调指出大会成立所谓朝鲜委员会的决定的有害后果之后，威尔勃洛夫斯基声称：该委员会最近的报告在联合国文件的历史上是独一无二的，因为它所透露的事实和它的结论之间有着尖锐的矛盾。正象镜子一般，报告反映出李承晚政权的野蛮恐怖，然而却没有予以谴责。
    为了要说明李承晚集团如何加剧恐怖来维持其朝不保夕的统治，威尔勃洛夫斯基并且援引报纸的消息，其中说南朝鲜的政治犯的人数一九四七年九月是一万人，二年后增至三万二千人。他并说，在一九五○年头四个月中，有三万二千人被捕。
    威尔勃洛夫斯基援引一九四八年十二月十五日生活杂志上所刊载的关于李承晚警察野蛮恐怖的目击者的记述，警察在进行“忠诚调查”时就把朝鲜人杀死在他们妻儿的面前。
    威尔勃洛夫斯基声言，安理会未能尽责促进和平解决，反而千方百计使冲突加剧，并且散布烟幕掩饰美国的军事行动。威尔勃洛夫斯基对于安理会未能就许多紧急呼吁采取行动，表示遗憾。这些呼吁中也有波兰政府的电报，它敦促安理会促使美国停止美国空军违背海牙公约的不分皂白的凶狠滥炸，这种滥炸已使朝鲜和平居民遭到大规模的屠杀，财产遭到惨重的毁坏。威尔勃洛夫斯基在结语中指出，虽然依照宪章规定的义务首先必须达到停止战事和撤退外国军队，然而英国的提案忽略了和平解决的这些基本前提而且企图求得与宪章相反的解决办法。英国的提案企图以联合国的威权来掩护美国的干涉，并企图保全恐怖主义的李承晚集团对于朝鲜人民的控制。
    威尔勃洛夫斯基警告说，如果采纳英国的提案，将使联合国大会成为奴役朝鲜人民的帮凶。他说，因此波兰代表团将投票反对整个提案。
    白俄罗斯代表发言
    白俄罗斯代表基塞列夫指出：联合国朝鲜委员会的报告力图把朝鲜冲突归罪于北朝鲜的人民。他宣称：因此，这个报告是意图攻击整个朝鲜人民以便美国盘据朝鲜。因此这个报告就必然百般歪曲事实。全世界都知道朝鲜的战争是李承晚集团发动的。
    基塞列夫引用了多种报纸，说明李承晚集团好战侵略计划的电讯。他指出纽约时报在六月二十六日刊载了该报驻朝鲜记者苏利凡的电讯，苏利凡在这次通讯里引述了李承晚在一九五○年三月间所作的演辞；在这个演说中，李承晚曾说：他的军队只要华盛顿“发出信号”即能对北朝鲜人进攻。
    基塞列夫称：八国向政治委员会所提出的提案也是想为外国在朝鲜的干涉辩解，并且使朝鲜的情势恶化。该提案是力求借此使安全理事会的非法决议“神圣化”。
    基塞列夫评论这些非法的决议时指出：赞同这些决议的安理会的理事国都拒绝考虑恢复朝鲜和平的任何可能的行动。基塞列夫称：干涉者在朝鲜使用联合国的旗帜给联合国造成了莫大的耻辱。他说：很明显的，在朝鲜所进行的干涉行动其目的仅在增进干涉者的一切利益，但是却与联合国宪章的原则完全背道而驰。
    基塞列夫痛斥在朝鲜的军事干涉者的野蛮行动，并指出：北朝鲜方面所发表的文件提供了无可争辩的事实，证明侵略者违反了海牙公约与有关规章。
    基塞列夫宣称：联合国只有根据宪章采取行动找出和平解决朝鲜战争的办法才能够真正履行它的义务。
    捷克代表发言
    接着发言的是捷克代表西罗基；他反对八国提案，因为这个提案规定由美国干涉者来占领整个朝鲜，因而剥夺了朝鲜人民的不可转让的自决权利。
    西罗基对政治委员会拒绝听取朝鲜人民的真正代表的意见，而仅仅根据李承晚政权所提供的“情报”来讨论这个问题表示遗憾。尽管联合国朝鲜委员会本质上是偏袒一面的，但它的报告说明：李承晚政权决心不与北朝鲜作任何妥协。
    西罗基随即引证许多文件，说明李承晚长期以来即准备对北朝鲜发动战争。西罗基并着重指出与这些战争准备同时进行的还有种种挑拨行为，例如六月十九日李承晚在杜勒斯面前宣称：如果不能“以冷战来保卫民主”，便将用真刀真枪的战争来达到这个目的。
    西罗基指出：安理会企图为美国的干涉辩解，这种行动是非法的，而且是在安理会两个常任理事国没有出席的情况下采取的。西罗基随即指出：和平解决的第一个条件就是撤退干涉军队。
    西罗基提到艾奇逊与奥斯汀否认美国在朝鲜有战略目的一事时说：如果他们愿意证明这一点，那是很容易的，即撤退美国的军队。
    西罗基继而描述在李承晚集团的政策引起的通货膨胀下，南朝鲜人民所遭受的苦难与贫困，并引证新苏黎世报的见解称，李承晚企图以进行侵略战争来避免彻底破产。
    西罗基又说：朝鲜人民的痛恨压迫他们的李承晚政权，已为许多美国报纸所承认，包括纽约先驱论坛报在内。该报描述南朝鲜为美国的保护国，一旦没有美国的保护就会马上垮台。西罗基着重指出：五月间的选举强有力地表明了人民对李承晚的抵抗，那次选举结果李承晚并没有能得到多数。这证明了李承晚只是在美国刺刀的帮助下才能苟延残喘。
    西罗基继称：捷克人民很了解朝鲜人民痛恨与蔑视把国家出卖给外国干涉者的李承晚政府的心情，因为捷克人民也有过自己的李承晚——如象哈加之流的亲纳粹的通敌分子。尽管这一切，而八国提案的发起人却仍要求把李承晚政权强加在全体朝鲜人民头上。捷克斯洛伐克代表团不能同意这种力图使朝鲜人民受美国占领、并力图剥夺朝鲜人民之自决权的提案。西罗基指出：捷克斯洛伐克将附议的旨在使朝鲜人民能民主地决定自己的前途而寻求和平解决朝鲜问题的苏联提案。
    最后发言者为南非联邦代表乔士德。他在简短发言中表示支持八国提案。
