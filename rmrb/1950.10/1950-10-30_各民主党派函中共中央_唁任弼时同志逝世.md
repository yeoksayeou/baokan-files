Xinhua News Agency, October 29th The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party sent a letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, expressing condolences on the passing of Ren Bishi. The condolence letter is as follows: To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:
Mr. Ren Bishi struggled for the cause of China's New Democracy for thirty years, enduring hardships, overcoming difficulties, and demonstrating great selflessness and revolutionary heroism. He assisted Chairman Mao in leading the people of the entire country to create the great spirit of unity, independence, freedom, and liberation for the Chinese people. Unfortunately, he succumbed to illness caused by overwork and passed away, which is a serious loss for the Chinese people. At this time, when revolutionary construction has begun, and when American imperialism is extending the flames of its aggression in Korea to the Chinese mainland, the sudden loss of a great fighter and leader is mourned by the people of the whole country. We call on all party members to learn from Mr. Bishi's great and glorious example, to unite more closely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and to more resolutely and bravely defend peace, oppose American imperialist aggression, and consolidate and develop the victory of the people's revolution. Mr. Bishi's spirit of revolutionary struggle will forever shine before the Chinese people.
