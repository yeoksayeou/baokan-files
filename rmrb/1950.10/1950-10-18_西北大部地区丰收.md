Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an – Farmers in various parts of Northwest China are now engaged in intense autumn harvesting. In Ningxia, the rice has mostly been brought in from the fields, and in northern Shaanxi, the corn, and in southern Shaanxi, the early rice will soon be completely harvested. This year, the autumn crops in various provinces of Northwest China, with the exception of some areas in Shaanxi and Gansu which suffered from drought, wind, and hail disasters resulting in slight reductions in production, have generally achieved a bumper harvest in other regions.

The autumn rice in the Hanzhong Basin of southern Shaanxi is estimated to be 80-90% of a normal year's yield, with an average yield of 5-6 *shi* (approximately 300-360 kg) of rice per *mu* (approximately 0.067 hectares), an increase of 20-30% compared to last year. The autumn crops in Pingliang, Qingyang, Tianshui and other districts of Gansu Province are also about 80% of a normal year. The harvest of rice, millet, and miscellaneous grains in Ningxia Province is also over 80%. Qinghai and Xinjiang provinces are also experiencing bumper harvests. For example, the 6 million *mu* of autumn fields in southern Xinjiang are expected to produce an additional 110 million *jin* (55,000 metric tons) of autumn grains such as rice and corn compared to last year. The wheat harvest in Northwest China this year was good, and now with the addition of a bumper autumn harvest, it is expected that the task of increasing grain production by 330 million *jin* in the entire region this year can be completed.

In order to establish good autumn harvest order, the people's governments at all levels in Northwest China held district and township cadre meetings and mass rallies before the autumn harvest to summarize the summer harvest experience, and mobilized militia organizations to form autumn protection teams to prevent sabotage and theft by lurking bandits, special agents, and lawless elements. Farmers in various counties of the Wudu district of Gansu also organized themselves to hunt and kill wild boars that were harmful to crops. Therefore, the phenomenon of theft and destruction of autumn crops this year has been greatly reduced compared to the past.

Mutual-aid teams for exchanging labor have developed greatly during the autumn harvest. According to statistics from six districts in Nanzheng County, a newly liberated area in southern Shaanxi, nearly a thousand autumn harvest mutual-aid teams have been organized, with more than 18,000 laborers participating, about double the number during the wheat harvest. At the same time, a large number of rural women also participated in the autumn harvest, enabling this year's autumn harvest to proceed quickly and smoothly.

Simultaneous with the autumn harvest, farmers in areas where winter wheat is planted are actively carrying out autumn plowing and wheat sowing.

　　西北大部地区丰收
    【新华社西安电】西北各地农民现正紧张地进行秋收。宁夏的稻子已大部登场，陕北的包谷、陕南的早稻也将收割完毕。今年西北各省的秋禾，除陕西、甘肃部分地区遭受旱、风、雹的灾害以致稍有减产外，其他地区都普获丰收。
    陕南汉中盆地的秋稻约有八、九成年景，每亩平均可产稻谷五、六市石，较去年增产二成到三成。甘肃省平凉、庆阳、天水等分区的秋禾也有八成左右年景，宁夏省的水稻、糜谷、杂粮等作物的收获量也都在八成以上。青海、新疆两省也是丰收年景。如南疆六百万亩秋田即可较去年增产稻子、包谷等秋粮一亿一千万斤。今年西北全区麦收时麦子收成较好，现在又加秋禾丰收，预计可完成今年全区增产粮食三亿三千万斤的任务。
    为了建立良好的秋收秩序，西北各地人民政府在秋收前曾普遍召开区、乡干部会议和群众大会，总结夏收经验，并动员民兵组织护秋队，防止潜藏土匪特务和不法分子的破坏和偷盗。甘肃武都分区各县农民还组织起来捕打为害农作物的野猪。因此今年秋禾偷盗破坏现象已较过去大为减少。
    秋收中变工互助组织有很大发展。据陕南新区南郑县六个区的统计，组织起来的秋收变工队近一千个，参加的劳力达一万八千余人，较麦收时约扩大一倍；同时，广大农村妇女也参加了秋收工作，使今年秋收得以迅速而顺利地进行。
    与秋收同时，在种冬麦的地区的农民，正在积极进行秋耕种麦。
