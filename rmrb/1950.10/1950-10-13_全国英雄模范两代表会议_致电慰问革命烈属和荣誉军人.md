　　The National Conference of Combat Heroes and the National Conference of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers sent the following telegram of condolence to all families of revolutionary martyrs and all honored servicemen:
    Dear comrades, families of all revolutionary martyrs, and all honored servicemen:

    As the National Conference of Combat Heroes and the National Conference of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers victoriously concluded in Beijing on October 2nd, we would like to express our deepest condolences to the martyrs who heroically sacrificed themselves for the revolutionary cause, and pay our respects to the honored servicemen who have suffered physical impairments for the revolutionary cause.

    We will always remember that in the long and arduous revolutionary struggle, thousands upon thousands of martyrs, for the liberation of the Chinese nation and the emancipation of the Chinese people, fought bravely on the battlefield, advancing wave upon wave, unyielding and indomitable, eliminating the enemy, and finally heroically sacrificing themselves, shedding their last drop of blood; in prisons and execution grounds, the martyrs remained loyal and unyielding, bravely resisted, resolutely struggled, and died heroically, crushing the enemy's vile plots, demonstrating great revolutionary integrity. These martyrs are truly the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people. Their most sublime revolutionary heroism inspires and excites our millions of comrades to inherit their unfinished heroic cause and advance bravely. Today, the Chinese people can achieve brilliant victories in the revolutionary war, can establish a new China under the people's democratic dictatorship, and the working people can truly stand up and become masters of the country, no longer being trampled underfoot by landlords, bureaucratic capitalists, Chiang Kai-shek, and imperialists, living a life worse than cattle and horses. This is primarily due to the blood and flesh shed by the martyrs. The earth-shattering and moving spirit of revolutionary heroism of the martyrs, and their great achievements, will forever live in the hearts of the Chinese people, their fame spreading for ten thousand generations, eternally immortal.

    We also always remember that the victory of the Chinese people is inseparable from the bloodshed of all honored servicemen. In the revolutionary struggle, you fought bravely, resolutely killed the enemy, and were honorably wounded for the people. After losing your health, you worked hard, actively participated in production, participated in work, abided by policies and laws, and united and educated the people. You have established indelible merits for the people, and promoted the noble qualities of the people's soldiers. You are the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, glorious people's heroes. You will forever enjoy the respect and love of the people of the whole country.

    At this conference, Chairman Mao instructed us to strive to build a strong national defense force and economic strength, and we must do these two major tasks well. Chairman Mao's words are very correct. Chiang Kai-shek, the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, fled to Taiwan and has not been completely eliminated. His followers are still hiding in various places, sabotaging and causing trouble. American imperialism is also attempting to invade the people's China, and China's industrial and agricultural production has not yet been greatly developed. We unanimously assure Chairman Mao that we will do as he says and do these two major tasks well. We must build a strong national defense force, thoroughly eliminate the remnant forces of the Chiang bandits, liberate all territories of the motherland, defend the security of the motherland, protect the people's good life, and defend world peace. We must work hard to improve production, increase the country's wealth, and improve the people's lives. We also unanimously express to you that we will unite the masses and better help you build your families, increase production, and solve your various difficulties. The martyrs used their blood to exchange for victory, opening up a path to freedom and happiness for us. We must carry forward the great revolutionary spirit of the martyrs, complete the unfinished cause of the martyrs, make our motherland more prosperous and consolidated, and make our people forever happy and boundless.

　　全国英雄模范两代表会议
    致电慰问革命烈属和荣誉军人
    【新华社十一日讯】全国战斗英雄代表会议和全国工、农、兵劳动模范代表会议的全体代表致全体革命烈士家属和全体荣誉军人慰问电如下：亲爱的全体革命烈士家属、全体荣誉军人同志们：
    全国战斗英雄代表会议和全国工、农、兵劳动模范代表会议，于十月二日在北京胜利闭幕的时候，我们谨掬至诚，悼念为革命事业英勇牺牲的烈士们，并向为革命事业损失了身体健康的荣誉军人同志们致敬。
    我们永远记着，在长期、艰苦的革命斗争中，成千成万的先烈们，为了中华民族的解放，中国人民的翻身，在战场上奋不顾身，前仆后继，百折不挠，消灭敌人，最后英勇的自我牺牲，流尽了最后的一滴血；在监牢里，刑场上，先烈们忠贞不移，威武不屈，坚决斗争，慷慨就义，粉碎了敌人的卑鄙阴谋，表现了伟大的革命气节。这些先烈们，真是中华民族和中国人民最优秀的儿女。他们的最崇高的革命英雄主义精神，鼓舞着、激动着我们成千百万的同志，继承他们未竟的英雄主义事业，勇敢前进。今天，中国人民能取得革命战争的辉煌胜利，能建立起人民民主专政的新中国，劳动人民能真翻身成了国家的主人，再不被地主、官僚资本、蒋介石、帝国主义踩在脚底下，过牛马不如的生活，这首先都是先烈们用血肉换得来的。先烈们惊天动地、可歌可泣的革命英雄主义的精神，先烈们的丰功伟绩，永远活在中国人民的心里，流芳万载，永垂不朽。
    我们也永远记着，中国人民的胜利，和全体荣誉军人同志们的流血是分不开的。你们在革命斗争里，英勇战斗，坚决杀敌，为人民而光荣地遭受伤残。你们失掉健康之后，又吃苦耐劳，积极参加生产，参加工作，遵守政策法令，团结与教育人民。你们为人民树立了不可磨灭的功绩，发扬了人民战士的高贵品质。你们是中华民族最优秀的儿女，光荣的人民功臣。你们永远享受全国人民对你们的尊敬与爱戴。
    在这次会议上，毛主席嘱咐我们，要努力建立强大的国防力量和经济力量，一定要办好这两件大事。毛主席的话是非常对的，中国人民的死敌蒋介石跑到台湾，还没有彻底完全消灭，他的徒子徒孙们，还藏在各地破坏捣乱，美帝国主义也在企图侵略人民的中国，中国的工业农业生产还没有大大的发展起来。我们一致的向毛主席保证，要依照他的话去做，把两件大事办好。一定要建设起强大的国防军，彻底消灭蒋匪帮的残余力量、解放祖国的一切领土，保卫祖国的安全，保卫人民过好日子，保卫世界和平。一定要努力搞好生产，增加国家的财富，改善人民的生活。我们也一致的向你们表示，要团结群众，更好地帮助你们建设家务，增加生产，解决你们各方面的困难。先烈们用鲜血换来了胜利，为我们开辟了自由幸福的道路。我们一定要发扬先烈们伟大的革命精神，完成烈士们的未竟事业，使我们的祖国更加繁荣巩固，使我们的人民永远幸福无疆。
