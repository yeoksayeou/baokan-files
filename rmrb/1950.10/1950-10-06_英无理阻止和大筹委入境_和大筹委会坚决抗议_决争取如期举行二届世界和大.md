　　Xinhua News Agency, 5th. TASS, Prague: The Preparatory Committee for the Second World Peace Congress, meeting in Prague, Czechoslovakia, issued a statement on the 3rd, firmly protesting the British government's ban on the entry of Raphael, Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, and other members of the Preparatory Committee into Britain to carry out preparatory work for the Second World Peace Congress.
    The statement pointed out: The Preparatory Committee has noted the correspondence between the leading body of the British peace movement and the British Prime Minister. The British Prime Minister has had to declare in writing that no force can prohibit the World Peace Congress from being held in Britain. In view of the growing strength of people with various opinions from all over the world participating in activities to prepare for this conference, the Preparatory Committee has decided to continue its efforts to overcome all the difficulties that may be encountered in holding the Second World Peace Congress in Britain as scheduled. The Preparatory Committee calls on peace advocates around the world to prevent a small number of people from attempting to suppress the voices of people of all nations against war at a time of current international tension.

    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社布拉格讯：在捷克斯洛伐克京城布拉格召开的第二届世界拥护和平大会筹备委员会，于三日发表声明，坚决抗议英国政府禁止世界拥护和平大会常设委员会总书记拉斐德，及筹备委员会的其他委员进入英国，为第二届世界拥护和平大会进行筹备工作。
    声明指出：筹备委员会已注意到英国和平运动领导机构与英国首相所来往的函件，英国首相已不得不以书面方式宣布：没有任何力量可以禁止拥护和平大会在英国举行。筹备委员会鉴于世界各国具有各种不同意见的人民，为筹备这次大会而进行活动的力量的日益增长，决定继续努力，以克服在英国如期举行第二届世界拥护和平大会所可能遭遇的一切困难。筹备委员会号召全世界和平拥护者阻止少数人在当前国际局势紧张的时候，企图压制各民族人民反对战争的声音。
