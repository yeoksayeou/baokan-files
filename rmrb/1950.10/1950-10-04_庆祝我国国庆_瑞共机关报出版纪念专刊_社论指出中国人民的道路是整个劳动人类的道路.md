　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 2nd. The Swedish Communist Party's organ, "Ny Tid" (New Era), published a special supplement to commemorate the anniversary of China's founding. The editorial mentioned the Chinese people's century-long struggle against imperialism and the recent imperialist aggression against China and its neighbors. The editorial stated: The victory of the Chinese people has widened the gap in the world imperialist system. The 475 million Chinese people, with the world's oldest culture, are diligent and intelligent, and possess perhaps the world's largest resources. Now they have calmly placed themselves in the camp of peace and democracy. China's victory is a new guarantee that the people are invincible in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism. Imperialism is doomed to perish. New China is being rebuilt according to China's specific conditions. The day is not far off when China will become a great advanced country in terms of industry, technology, and material level. Half of humanity has already chosen the path to prosperity, peace, and the happiness of all working people. This path will soon become the path of all working humanity. The Swedish Communists extend fraternal congratulations to the great Chinese people, to the Communist Party and its leader Mao Zedong.
