　　Northeast China's Seven Major State-Owned Coal Mines
    Vigorously Promote New Coal Mining Methods
    Production Increased, Costs Reduced, and Safe Production Strongly Guaranteed.
    [This newspaper's dispatch] According to the Northeast Daily: Over the past year, the seven major state-owned coal mines under the Northeast Coal Mining Administration, namely Hegang, Jixi, Tonghua, Xi'an, Fuxin, Jiaohe, and Beipiao, have vigorously reformed old coal mining methods and systematically implemented new-style and mechanized coal mining. This has greatly improved production efficiency, reduced production costs, enhanced the technical operating skills of the vast majority of workers, and guaranteed safe production.
    Since the implementation of the new-style coal mining method, the daily output of Hegang Coal Mine has increased to three times that of a year ago, and overall labor productivity has increased from 0.59 tons to 0.84 tons. After centralized production, the consumption of basic materials decreased by 22 percent, and the cost per ton decreased from more than 500,000 yuan to more than 400,000 yuan (Northeast currency, same below). Since June, the Jixi Coal Mine has mostly switched to retreating longwall mining and mechanized mining, and the recovery rate has increased from an average of 74 percent to 92 percent. Since Tonghua Coal Mine switched to mechanized production, direct production efficiency has increased fourfold compared to last year. In the first half of the year, the Xi'an Mining Bureau overfulfilled its tunneling tasks by more than 21 percent. The Fuguo Mine alone under this bureau saved 9.8 billion yuan in the first half of this year.
    After the implementation of the new-style coal mining method, the safety work of various mines has been greatly improved. In terms of ventilation methods, most mines have changed from natural ventilation to mechanical ventilation and from single-line ventilation to diversion ventilation. Various methods to ensure safe production have also been created in terms of filling methods (such as Hegang's overall caving filling method and Xi'an's cumulative hanging comprehensive filling method). Various mines have also established various responsibility systems and implemented a quarterly safety inspection system. These measures have promoted and guaranteed safe production. Taking Jixi Mine as an example, the number of permanent seals in the second quarter increased by 118 compared to the first quarter, the number of passage doors increased by 13, the number of air volume doors increased by 5, the number of air doors increased by 34, and the number of wind measurement doors, permanent and temporary air bridges, and safety gates increased, enabling the air intake of most pits to meet the standards. In July, the injury rate per 10,000 tons of coal in Xi'an Mine decreased by 38 percent compared to May, and the death rate decreased by 72 percent. In the first half of this year, the number of casualties in Hegang Mine decreased by 12 percent compared to the second half of last year, and the number of accidents decreased by 34 percent.

　　东北七大国营煤矿
    大力推行新采煤法
    生产提高，成本降低，安全生产获得有力保证。
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：东北煤矿管理局所属鹤岗、鸡西、通化、西安、阜新、蛟河、北票七大国营煤矿，一年来大力改革旧的采煤方法，有步骤地实行了新式采煤与机械化采煤，大大提高了生产效率，降低了生产成本，提高了广大职工的技术操作水平，保证了安全生产。
    自实行新式采煤法后，鹤岗煤矿的日产量已提高到一年前的三倍，全员能率由○·五九吨提高到○·八四吨；集中生产后，基本材料的消耗降低了百分之二十二，每吨成本由五十余万元降低到四十余万元（东北币，下同）。鸡西煤矿自六月份开始，绝大部分改为后退长壁采煤和机械化采煤，回收率平均由百分之七十四提高到百分之九十二。通化煤矿自改为机械生产后，直接生产效率比去年提高了四倍。西安矿务局上半年超额完成掘进任务百分之二十一强，仅该局富国矿一个矿，今年上半年即节省资金九十八亿元。
    推行新式采煤法后，各矿的保安工作已获重大改善。在通风的方法上，各矿大部分由自然通风改为机械通风，由一条龙通风改为分流通风；在充填方法上也创造了各式各样保证安全生产的方法（如鹤岗的全面冒顶充填法，西安的累段追挂式全面充填法）；各矿又建立了各种责任制，实行了每一季度的保安检查制度；这些措施都促进与保证了安全生产。以鸡西矿为例，该矿第二季的永久密闭比第一季增加了一百一十八个，通行门增加了十三个，风量门增加了五个，风门增加了三十四个，测风门、永久和临时风桥及保险闸等均有增加，使大部分坑的入风量达到了标准。西安矿七月份每万吨煤的负伤率比五月份减少了百分之三十八，死亡率减少了百分之七十二。鹤岗矿今年上半年比去年下半年的伤亡数减少了百分之十二，事故次数减少了百分之三十四。
