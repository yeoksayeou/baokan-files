　　The CCP Tangshan Prefectural Committee Inspects Agricultural Propaganda Work
    Propaganda Content Lengthy and Hackneyed, Meetings Full of Empty Talk
    [Our Newspaper] During the rectification campaign, the Propaganda Department of the CCP Tangshan Prefectural Committee discovered that propaganda departments at all levels universally exhibited bureaucratic and commandist work styles in agricultural production propaganda and mobilization work.

    In terms of propaganda content, most departments were accustomed to purely ideological mobilization detached from reality. Currently, farmers throughout the prefecture have gradually understood the Party and government's production policies, and their enthusiasm for production has also increased. The farmers' current common demand is for the timely resolution of various specific problems, such as learning agricultural techniques. However, the propaganda content of the propaganda departments at all levels in the area remains the same old stuff, with lengthy speeches everywhere on "Production Overrides Everything," "Diligent Production, Labor Leads to Prosperity," and "More Benefits from Organizing," which aroused farmers' boredom. Some people said, "Don't talk about this! What we want to know is: What to do if wheat turns yellow? What to do if cotton gets aphids and can't be dealt with? How to organize mutual aid teams so they don't collapse?" Many farmers in Leting, Linyu, and Luan counties said, "Opening meetings like this is not as good as letting us produce more!"

    Regarding meeting methods, the general situation is that the meetings lacked a central focus, were not prepared in advance, and were full of endless, empty talk. Recently, the Fourth District of Fengrun held a joint meeting of key cadres from all villages in the district, with the leadership intending to implement the Three Autumn Campaigns (autumn harvesting, plowing and sowing) and arrange resettlement work, planning a one-day meeting with an emphasis on discussion. However, in the meeting, after the district head and district secretary spoke about the Three Autumn Campaigns and resettlement work, the district militia captain and security officer each gave a speech on autumn protection and anti-espionage work, and touched on the issue of organizing militia forces; the section chief of the county Public Security Bureau repeated the above issues for more than half an hour; the district propaganda committee member arranged for branch education; the women's federation director explained the Marriage Law; and finally, the civil affairs assistant arranged for four types of forms. The entire meeting became a place for polite exchanges, with everyone taking turns speaking, as if one would lose face if they didn't speak. The village cadres, at first, took notes, but later became bored and stopped taking notes, and some even fell asleep. Li Qingsheng, the branch secretary of Huangxin Wuzhuangzi, said, "My God! What exactly are you asking me to do? With such arrangements, there is no way to do a good job." Some district cadres, in summer production, in order to mobilize the masses to press green manure, even started from the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year War of Liberation, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. The meeting content was not only empty, but also held very frequently, which not only failed to solve problems, but also affected production. Therefore, it aroused opposition from the masses. In the Fifth Street of Changli Chengguan District, no one came to the meeting, and the masses said, "It's useless to go, it's just the same old stuff." In some places, only a few people attended mass meetings, and some people sent their children to listen. In this situation, some cadres adopted coercive methods, ordering the masses to attend meetings; others scolded the masses as "backward elements who do not understand democracy."

    During the rectification, the Propaganda Department of the Tangshan Prefectural Committee has further analyzed and criticized the harmfulness of this propaganda method that is detached from reality and relies on forced orders, and is preparing to implement the spirit of the CCP Central Committee's "Instructions on Land Reform and Party Rectification Work in 1948" regarding meeting methods into propaganda work in order to correct the above-mentioned shortcomings and errors.

### 中共唐山地委检查农业宣传工作  宣传内容长篇大论召开会议夸夸其谈

　　中共唐山地委检查农业宣传工作
    宣传内容长篇大论召开会议夸夸其谈
    【本报讯】中共唐山地委宣传部整风期间，检查出各级宣传部门在农业生产的宣传鼓动工作中，普遍存在着官僚主义与命令主义作风。
    在宣传内容上，大多数习惯于脱离实际的单纯思想动员。目前全专区农民对党和政府的生产政策已经逐步了解，生产积极性也随着提高；目前农民普遍的要求是，及时地解决各种具体问题，如学习农业技术等。可是该区各级宣传部门的宣传内容，仍然是老一套，到处长篇大论的讲述着：“生产压倒一切”、“努力生产、劳动致富”、“组织起来好处多”，引起了农民的厌烦。有人说：“你们别说这个啦！我们要知道的是：麦子起黄疸怎么办？棉花长腻虫收拾不好怎办？互助组怎么组织才不垮台？”乐亭、临榆、滦县的好多农民说：“照这样开会，还不如让我们多生产一些好！”
    在开会方法上，普遍的情况是会议没有中心，会前不加准备，会场上漫无边际地夸夸其谈。丰润四区最近召开了一个全区各村主要干部联席会议，领导意图是贯彻三秋工作和布置复员工作，计划会期一天、并着重讨论。但会议中，区长、区书讲了三秋工作和复员工作后，接着区民兵队长、治安员各讲了一套护秋防特工作，并扯到组织民兵武装问题，县公安局股长又把以上问题重复半个多钟头；区宣传委员布置了支部教育；妇联主任讲解了婚姻法；最后民政助理员又布置了四种表格。把整个会议变成了讲客气的场所，你让我讲，我让你讲，谁要不讲话，好像面子就不好看。村干部们呢，起初还有人记笔记，后来听得发烦，笔记也没人记了，有的人却睡熟了。黄心五庄子支书李庆生说：“我的老天！究竟你们叫我搞那个？这么布置不用想搞好工作。”有的区干部，在夏季生产中，为了发动群众压绿肥，竟从八年抗战，三年解放战争讲起，造成群众不满。会议内容既空洞，又开得十分频繁，不仅不能解决问题，反而影响了生产。因此，引起群众的反对。昌黎城关区五街，召集开会没人到来，群众说：“去不去没啥用，反正是那一套。”好些地方，开群众会只有几个人参加，有的人叫小孩去听。在这种情况下，有些干部就采取了强制的办法，命令群众参加会议；有的则漫骂群众为“落后分子，不懂民主。”
    整风中，唐山地委宣传部已进一步分析批判这种脱离实际，强迫命令的宣传方法的危害性，并准备将中共中央“关于一九四八年土地改革工作和整党工作的指示”中关于开会方法的精神，贯彻到宣传工作中去，以纠正上述的缺点与错误。
