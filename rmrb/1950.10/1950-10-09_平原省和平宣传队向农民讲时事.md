In order to further expand the propaganda for defending world peace and promote the peace signature campaign to the vast countryside, Pingyuan Province specially formed a "Peace Signature Mobile Propaganda Team" composed of more than 50 members from the Provincial Cultural Troupe, the Friendship Association, the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Trade Union, the Youth League Working Committee, the Women's Federation, and other organizations. The team went to the Huxi Special District to promote and carry out the peace signature campaign. The illustration shows the propaganda team conducting propaganda in the countryside. Among the villagers listening to the lecture, a primary school student pointed to the map and said, "Look how big this red area is, it's all the Soviet Union, China, and other democratic countries. With such a large area, we're not afraid of anything!"

　　平原省和平宣传队向农民讲时事
    平原省为了进一步扩大保卫世界和平的宣传并把和平签名运动向广大农村推展，特由省文工团、友协、文联、工会、青年团工委、妇联等团体合组成“和平签名流动宣传队”，全体队员五十余人，赴湖西专区宣传并推展和平签名运动，图示宣传队在农村进行宣传的情形。在听讲的老乡中，有一个小学生指着地图说：“您看这块红的有多大，这都是苏联、中国与别的民主国家，咱们有这么大的地方，什么也不怕呀！”
