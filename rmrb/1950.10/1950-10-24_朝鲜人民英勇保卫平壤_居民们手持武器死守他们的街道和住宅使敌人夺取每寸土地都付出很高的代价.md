　　Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: TASS Moscow, 22nd: "Pravda"'s special correspondent in Korea, Bochenko, reported on the heroism displayed by the defenders of Pyongyang. Bochenko wrote: "I saw the retreat from Pyongyang. I saw workers gnashing their teeth in resentment, dismantling machines, carrying parts to the train station, and loading these parts onto freight cars despite the air raids."

　　Tens of thousands of families left their hometowns, where they had grown up and worked. American planes strafed and bombed these endless streams of peaceful Korean residents day and night.

　　During this period, Pyongyang presented an atmosphere of combat and a solemn appearance. Tens of thousands of residents established defensive positions in the areas surrounding Pyongyang.

　　The allied forces of the American, British, and Japanese invaders, supported by the Syngman Rhee gang, after several days of stubborn fighting on the outskirts of Pyongyang, attacked and entered the city. British motorized infantry occupied the bridge, and after crossing the bridge leading to the right bank of the river, they began fighting in the city center. Several teams of Japanese soldiers followed closely behind the British butchers across the river.

　　 Fierce fighting took place on the main thoroughfares of the city and around Moranbong. Obstacles made of streetcars, telephone poles, and sandbags blocked the enemy's advance. The enemy had to pay a high price to capture every street. When the soldiers ran out of ammunition and reinforcements, they continued to fight the enemy with their rifle butts. Many residents, entire families, held weapons and defended their streets and homes to the death.

　　Afraid that the People's Army would send new reinforcements, the U.S. military dropped paratroopers north of the city, cutting off the last road. The surrounded defenders continued to fight the enemy bravely with supreme tenacity.

　　Bochenko wrote: "The American liars announced the capture of Pyongyang early on. But the fighting is still going on in the city. The Korean people are fighting self-sacrificingly, shooting at the invaders from attics or cellars. On the hills outside the city, the artillery is still very active, and machine guns continue to kill the enemies deeply hated by the Korean people."
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: TASS dispatch: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Democratic Republic announced on the 22nd that: People's Army troops on all fronts are resisting the advancing U.S. military and South Korean puppet army.

　　In the northeast and northwest areas of Pyongyang, People's Army troops engaged in stubborn defensive battles and continued to actively fight the U.S. paratrooper forces that landed north of Pyongyang. At the same time, People's Army troops engaged in stubborn street fighting within Pyongyang city.

　　On the east coast, north and northeast of Hamhung, People's Army troops retreated slightly under the advance of a superior enemy force.

　　朝鲜人民英勇保卫平壤
    居民们手持武器死守他们的街道和住宅使敌人夺取每寸土地都付出很高的代价
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十二日电：真理报驻朝鲜特派记者波诚科报道平壤保卫者所表现的英雄主义。波诚科写道：我看到平壤撤退的情形。我看见愤恨得咬牙切齿的工人，拆卸了机器，背着零件走向火车站，并且不顾空袭把这些零件装上货车。
    成千成万的家庭离开他们的故乡，他们是在这个城市中生长的，并且在这里工作的。美机日以继夜地扫射和轰炸这些络绎不绝的朝鲜和平居民。
    平壤在这时期呈现出战斗的气氛和严肃的面貌。成千成万的居民在平壤外围地区建立了防守的阵地。
    美国、英国和日本侵略者的联军，在李承晚匪帮的支持下，在平壤外围进行了接连数日的顽强战斗后，攻入了该城。英国的摩托化步兵攻占了大桥，在越过通往江面右岸的大桥以后就在城中心开始进行战斗。几队日本兵紧跟着英国屠手们过了江。
    在城内通衢大道，在牡丹峰一带，进行了激烈的战斗。以电车、电线杆和沙袋堆成的障碍物，阻挡了敌人的前进。敌人在夺取每一条街道时都不得不付出很高的代价。战士们在弹尽援绝的时候，就以枪把继续对敌人奋战。居民们许多都全家手持武器，死守他们的街道和住宅。
    美军害怕人民军开来新的援军，就在城北空投伞兵，切断了最后的道路。被包围的保卫者们，继续以至高无上的顽强精神对敌人英勇作战。
    波诚科写道：美国骗子早早地就宣布了攻占平壤的消息。但是城内仍在战斗之中。朝鲜人民正自我牺牲地进行战斗，从阁楼上或地窖内射击侵略者。在郊外的山上，炮兵仍然十分活跃，机关枪不断打死朝鲜人民所深恶痛绝的敌人。
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部二十二日发表战报称：人民军部队在各战线抵抗进犯的美军和南朝鲜伪军。
    在平壤东北和西北地区，人民军部队进行了顽强的防御战，继续与美国在平壤以北降落的伞兵部队积极作战。同时，人民军部队在平壤市内进行顽强的巷战。
    在东海岸咸兴以北和东北地区，人民军部队在优势的敌军的进犯下略有后退。
