Hunan Prepares for Autumn Grain Tax Collection
　　Focusing on Unifying Cadres' Thinking
　　Correcting Erroneous Ideas of Conflict Between Policy and Task Through Comparison and Specific Accounting.
　　[Comprehensive report from this newspaper] In order to prepare for the autumn grain tax collection, various regions in Hunan successively convened expanded cadre meetings in early and mid-September to deploy the autumn grain tax collection tasks and resolve several ideological problems of cadres regarding the autumn grain tax collection. Changde County held a cadre meeting from September 5th to 16th to deploy the autumn grain tax collection tasks. At the same time, it reviewed and studied the experience of using peasant representative conferences in the past grain collection, and how to use peasant representative conferences in future grain collection. In the past, when using peasant representative conferences for autumn grain tax collection, two deviations occurred: one was to regard the peasant representative conference as an ordinary meeting of activists, failing to understand that using the peasant representative conference is the basic organizational form for following the mass line to complete grain collection. The other was to regard the peasant representative conference as a routine matter, indicating that the work had been "deployed through representatives" and "through the peasant representative conference," and that the mass line had been followed. In reality, the true role of the peasant representative conference was underestimated, causing it to become a formality. In actual work, the method of cadres being dispersed to sit in villages was still used. This fully demonstrated that some cadres still had tendencies toward empiricism, lacked a mass perspective, and did not trust the masses. After examining their thinking and studying documents, the cadres began to realize the significance of using peasant representative conferences, took a step forward in ideological understanding, and clarified that in the future, when using peasant representative conferences for autumn grain tax collection, the main tasks should be to solve three problems: first, to unify thinking and accept the task; second, to democratically assess and distribute the task; and third, to discuss and stipulate specific methods for completing the task.
　　During the autumn grain tax collection, some ideological problems also generally existed among cadres. Judging from the ideas reflected at the Liuyang County All-Circles Representative Conference on September 12th, a more typical problem was that most district cadres had more or less localism when accepting tasks. They disagreed with the tasks assigned by the higher authorities, and even easily negated the figures related to land yields they had previously grasped. When the leadership discovered this situation, they immediately repeatedly explained and analyzed the favorable and unfavorable conditions for this year's autumn grain tax collection, carried out political mobilization, and unified the cadres' thinking by specifically calculating accounts, thus smoothly distributing the tasks. However, after accepting the tasks, another kind of erroneous thinking emerged among some cadres. They believed that the tasks and policies were contradictory, and that if they acted according to the policies, they would not be able to complete the tasks on schedule. The main reason for this thinking was that the materials currently available were not accurate, and there were still many hidden fields that had not been discovered. After the leadership emphasized that as long as the masses were mobilized and the actual yields were carefully assessed, it would be possible to complete the tasks according to the policies. After sufficient persuasion and education, both of the above-mentioned erroneous ideas have been corrected. At the expanded cadre meeting in Chaling County in early September to deploy the autumn grain tax collection, three issues were mainly resolved. The first was the issue of conflict between tasks and policies. Many cadres believed that there were few leading cadres in the district and the time was short, and if they wanted to complete the tasks, they would inevitably commit the fault of administrative orders. Some cadres, because they had undergone rectification, were afraid of making mistakes, so they held back. Later, after the leadership analyzed the situation and launched group discussions, everyone realized from repeated discussions and comparisons that there were more favorable conditions for this year's autumn grain tax collection, such as the masses being easy to mobilize, the tasks being lighter than last year, the harvest being good, and land reform being carried out this winter, so the masses would definitely enthusiastically hand in grain. As long as they were good at consulting with the masses, they would definitely be able to complete the tasks correctly. In this way, the above-mentioned ideological problems were resolved. The representatives at the meeting raised more than 30 policy-related questions, which were discussed separately by everyone, and the leadership gave special answers. Those that could not be answered immediately were referred to the higher authorities for answers. In this way, everyone fully understood the spirit of the policies, and when the tasks were assigned, major troubles would not occur, and they would be able to act according to the policies. Finally, the specific methods of the entire work were studied, and the difficulties in the work after the task assignment were resolved. It is planned to complete all tasks by the end of October. The autumn grain tax collection work in Sangzhi and other counties has entered the stage of squeezing out hidden fields. In the eight villages of Siwang Township in the Second District of the county, 8,782 *shi* of hidden fields were squeezed out. The same situation exists in other districts. For example, in Linxiang County, the public grain in each district also began to be put into storage one after another in late September. The Seventh District completed its tasks in full in nine days, doing it quickly and well, and no major deviations occurred, and it won the honorary title of model district in the county.

　　湖南各地准备秋征
    着重打通干部思想
    通过对比与具体算账，纠正了政策与任务矛盾的错误思想。
    【本报综合讯】湖南各地为做好秋征准备工作，先后于九月上、中旬召开扩大干部会议，布置秋征任务，解决干部对秋征的若干思想问题。常德县于九月五日至十六日召开干部大会，布置秋征任务，同时检查和研究了过去征粮中运用农代会的经验，及今后征粮如何运用农代会的问题。过去运用农代会进行秋征时，曾经发生两种偏差：一是把农代会看成通常的积极分子会议，不懂得运用农代会是走群众路线完成征粮的基本组织形式。另一种是把农代会看成一种例行的公事，表示工作已经“通过代表”、“通过农代会”布置下去，已经走了群众路线了。实际上对农代会的真正作用估计不足，致使农代会流于形式。在实际工作时，仍须运用干部分散坐村的方法。这充分说明了某些干部还存在着经验主义、缺乏群众观点与不相信群众的偏向。经过检查思想，学习文件，干部开始认识了运用农代会的意义，在思想认识上提高了一步，明确了今后在运用农代会进行秋征时，主要应解决三个问题：一、打通思想接受任务，二、民主评议分配任务，三、讨论规定完成任务的具体办法。
    在秋征中，一般干部还存在着一些思想问题。从九月十二日浏阳县各界代表会议上所反映的思想看来，较典型的是：多数区干部在接受任务时，或多或少的都有些本位主义思想。不同意上级所分配的任务，甚至把自己以往掌握的有关土地产量的数字也轻易否定了。领导上发现了这种情况，立即反复说明并分析了今年秋征的有利条件与不利条件，作了政治动员，并以具体算账的方法，打通干部思想，顺利地分配了任务。但接受任务后在某些干部中又产生了另外一种错误思想，他们认为任务与政策是矛盾的，要按政策办事，就不能如期完成任务。产生这种思想的主要原因是现在掌握的材料不确实，仍有不少黑田未被发现。经过领导上强调指出：只要发动了群众、认真评实产量，是能够按政策完成任务的。经过充分的说服教育，上述两种错误思想均已纠正。在茶陵县九月上旬布置秋征的干部扩大会议上，着重解决了三个问题，首先就是任务与政策矛盾的问题。许多干部认为区的领导干部少，时间短促，想完成任务，非犯行政命令的毛病不可。有的干部由于经过整风，害怕犯错误，因此缩手缩脚。后经领导上分析情况，展开小组讨论，大家才从反复讨论和对比中，体会到今年秋征的有利条件是多的，如群众易发动，任务比去年轻，收成好，且今冬要土改，群众一定踊跃交粮，只要善于和群众商量，一定可以正确地完成任务。这样把上述思想问题解决了。各代表在这个会上，提出了三十多个有关政策性的问题，经大家分别讨论，领导上又作了专门的解答，一时不能解答者请示上级给予解答。这样使大家充分体会了政策精神，把任务分配下去，就不致发生重大的麻烦，而能够按政策办事。最后并研究了整个工作的具体作法，解决了任务分配以后的工作困难。计划全部任务在十月底完成。桑植等县秋征工作，已经进入挤查黑田的阶段。该县二区四望乡八个村即挤出黑田八千七百八十二石。其他区亦有同样情形。如临湘县各区公粮亦于九月下旬先后开始入库，第七区以九天时间，如数完成任务，做得又快又好，且未发生重大偏差，荣获全县模范区的光荣称号。
