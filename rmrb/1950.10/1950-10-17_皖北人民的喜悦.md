The Joy of the People in Northern Anhui
By our reporter Lin Hong

(I) Years of Hopes Realized

For many years, the millions of people in the Huai River region of northern Anhui have had one of the most pressing demands: to have the Huai River harnessed as soon as possible. During the long years of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, although people buried such a common and good desire in their hearts, the cruel reality had already told them that this was just an excessive hope. No one had ever dared to imagine that there could be such a day when the floodwaters of the Huai River would flow peacefully through the fertile fields on both sides of the river without causing floods. Today, and only today, in an era when the people are masters of their own affairs, this reasonable demand has the opportunity to be realized. When Chairman Mao's instructions to thoroughly harness the Huai River spread to every village in the Huai River basin, millions of people immediately felt heartfelt joy and unanimously thanked Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government for their concern for them.

(II) The Kuomintang and the Huai River Harnessing Project

In Nanjing, Bengbu, and Hefei, I met with many water conservancy experts who have been engaged in Huai River harnessing for many years. They also felt happy and excited about the great Huai River harnessing project that is about to begin. As early as 1929 (the 18th year of the Republic of China), the Kuomintang reactionary government established the Huai River Guidance Committee. On the surface, it seemed like they were doing a good thing for the people; in fact, this was just a trick by Chiang Kai-shek to deceive the people. When I met with these water conservancy experts, we naturally talked about these past events.

Chen Hefu is now the deputy director of the Huai River Middle and Upper Reaches Engineering Bureau. He participated in the Huai River harnessing work from the first day of the establishment of the Huai River Guidance Committee, and it has been almost twenty years to this day. When I talked to him about the Huai River harnessing issue in Bengbu this time, he said with great emotion: "When the Kuomintang reactionary government established the Huai River Guidance Committee, Chiang Kai-shek personally served as the chairman. Not only were the people deceived, but even we water conservancy workers mistakenly believed that the Huai River problem could be solved satisfactorily. We were extremely excited and joined the Huai River guidance work one after another. Li Yizhi, a famous water conservancy expert who has passed away in our country, was the chief engineer. The following year, the Huai River guidance plan was formulated. In the third year (1931), the Huai River suffered a major flood that had not been seen in a century, and the loss of people's lives and property was countless. We all believed that the major flood would accelerate the realization of the Huai River guidance plan. However, the fact was not so. The reactionary government did not care about the suffering of the people at all, and the money allocated each year was not enough to cover the office expenses of the Huai River Guidance Committee. Seeing that the Kuomintang was not sincere, Li Yizhi was very angry and soon left. Speaking of which, it is really pitiful. Until the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, which was almost ten years, all the Huai River guidance projects only built a few ship locks related to shipping on the Grand Canal, and the source of funding came from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity.

"In fact, the sins of the Kuomintang reactionaries are more than that. What is particularly hateful is Chiang Kai-shek's breaching of the dikes at Huayuankou, which was truly an unprecedentedly heinous act of brutality." Speaking of this, Deputy Director Chen took out a map of the Huai River basin, pointed out the scope of the Yellow River flooded area, and explained the deterioration of the Huai River system since the Yellow River diverted into the Huai River.

(III) A Bright and Happy Future

The news of harnessing the Huai River is indeed a great excitement and encouragement for the millions of people along the Huai River. Because the disasters brought to them by the rolling floods for so many years are too great and too profound. Being able to harness the Huai River today will not only solve the livelihood of the disaster victims through work-for-relief, but also, as many villagers say, their children and grandchildren will be able to live in peace.

Mohekou is the place where the Huai River and the Ying River converge within the Fuyang area. Since Chiang Kai-shek breached the dikes at Huayuankou in 1938 and the Yellow River diverted into the Huai River, there has not been a year without famine. The poverty of the people has truly reached its extreme. This year, the flood of the Huai River was so great that the people in the Mohekou area were of course the first to bear the brunt. After the flood occurred, the masses were generally pessimistic and disappointed. Some said: "We didn't starve to death last year, but we can't escape this year." Some said: "This year, eight hundred miles of the Huai dike have been breached, and the grain collected by the government last year has been used to provide relief to us; this year, the government can't collect grain again, where will there be such a large capital to treat us!" However, when boats of relief grain and boats of late autumn seeds were transferred through Mohekou to the vast disaster areas, smiles gradually appeared on people's faces. In particular, when they heard that many seeds were shipped from the Northeast, many people were a little surprised; however, they immediately thought of how great the power of the people's country led by Chairman Mao is! Soon, the Fuyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office sent people to Mohekou to set up a river harnessing command and explained to the masses that Chairman Mao had instructed to harness the Huai River well. The news spread immediately. Whether it was old people or young people, they were very happy to hear it and asked when the work would start. In this way, the shadow of pessimism and despair that had remained quickly disappeared. Those who had originally planned to flee the famine did not flee; even more people were preparing to do business along the river after the river work began, or they were repairing ships to transport grain and grass in the future.

What happened in Mohekou is just one example of thousands of villages. After the disaster victims in Lingbi County heard the news of the river harnessing, many people immediately built ships to prepare to transport grain and grass; the disaster victims who blindly fled from Wuhe County returned to their hometowns after hearing that they were going to "build dams"; more than 90 people fled from Jiaotong Street in Chengguan District, and more than 30 people had automatically returned by the beginning of September; more than 2,000 people fled from Wu North District, and more than half of them had returned. Some elderly people, based on their many years of experience, also put forward their opinions on the Huai River harnessing project. They said to the cadres: "It is not enough to just build dams, we must also manage Zhengyangguan and Xiashankou (referring to dredging the river channels near the two places)."

In Wuhe County, such a thing once happened. The county party secretary of the county went to the countryside to inspect the disaster relief work. Because the wind was blowing temporarily, the ship was difficult to navigate, so he stayed in a village. In order to know more about the river harnessing news, the villagers sent people to invite him to hold a meeting and talk to everyone about building dams (referring to repairing dikes). The county party secretary explained in detail to the people attending the meeting how Chairman Mao cared about the disaster victims and instructed to harness the Huai River well. The villagers were extremely excited, and many people said: "This time there is a way!"

### 皖北人民的喜悦

　　皖北人民的喜悦
    本报记者  林洪
    （一）多年的愿望实现了
    皖北沿淮地区千百万人民，许多年来有一个最迫切的要求，就是能够早日把淮河治好。在国民党反动统治的漫长岁月里，人们的心里虽然埋藏着这样一个共同的善良愿望，但是，残酷的现实却早已告诉他们：这不过是一个过高的奢望而已。从来也没有一个人敢于想像，能够有这样的一天，淮河的洪水平静地流过两岸肥美的良田，而不致于泛滥成灾。今天，也只有在今天，在人民当家作主人的时代，这一合理的要求，才得到了实现的机会。当毛主席根治淮河的指示传遍了淮河流域的每一个村庄的时候，千百万人民立刻感到了衷心的喜悦，一致感谢毛主席，感谢中央人民政府对他们的关怀。
    （二）国民党与治淮工程
    在南京、蚌埠和合肥，我先后会见了许多位多年从事治淮的水利专家，他们对于即将动工的伟大的治淮工程，同样感到愉快和兴奋。早在一九二九年（民国十八年），国民党反动政府就成立了导淮委员会。从表面上看来，像是要为老百姓作一件好事；其实，这不过是蒋介石欺骗人民的勾当。当我和这许多位水利专家见面的时候，我们很自然的就谈起了这一些往事。
    陈和甫是现在淮河中上游工程局副局长，从导淮委员会成立的第一天起，就参加了治淮工作，到今天差不多有二十年的历史。这一次我在蚌埠同他谈起治淮问题时，他十分感慨地说：“当时国民党反动政府成立导淮委员会，蒋介石亲自兼任委员长，不但人民受了蒙蔽，就是我们水利工作者，也误认为淮河问题可以得到圆满解决了，兴奋异常，纷纷参加导淮工作。我国已故名水利专家李仪祉是总工程师。第二年就制定了导淮计划。第三年（一九三一）淮河发生了百年未见的大水灾，人民生命财产的损失无数。我们都认为，那次的大水灾，一定会加速治淮计划的实现。然而，事实不是那样，反动政府对人民的痛苦毫不关心，每年拨下来的钱，还不够导淮委员会的办公费。李仪祉看见国民党没有诚意，非常气愤，很快就离开了。说起来，也真可怜，直到抗战爆发差不多十年的时间，全部导淮工程，只在运河上修了几座有关航运的船闸，而且经费的来源还出自中英庚款。
    “其实，国民党反动派的罪过还不止此，特别令人痛恨的，就是蒋介石在花园口的掘堤，那真是历史上从未有过的罪大恶极的残暴行为。”谈到这里，陈副局长拿出一张淮河流域的地图，指出黄泛区的范围，说明了淮河水系自黄水夺淮以后败坏的情形。
    （三）光明幸福的远景
    治淮的消息，对于沿淮的千万人民，确实是一个极大的兴奋和鼓舞。因为，多少年来滚滚的洪水给他们带来的祸害是太大、太深重了。今天能够把淮河治好，不但通过以工代赈可以解决灾民的生活，而且正如许多老乡说的，他们的子子孙孙才能过太平日子。
    沫河口是阜阳专区境内淮河与颍河会合的地方，自从一九三八年蒋介石在花园口掘堤黄水夺淮以来，没有一年没有灾荒。人民的穷困真是到了极点。今年，淮河的洪水是那样大，沫河口一带的人民当然又是首当其冲了，水灾发生后，群众普遍悲观失望。有的说：“去年没有饿死，今年也跑不掉。”有的说：“今年八百里的淮堤都破了，政府去年收来的粮食都救济了我们；今年政府又收不到粮食，那里还有这样大的本钱来救治我们！”但是，当一船一船的救济粮，一船一船的晚秋种子，经过沫河口转运到广大灾区的时候，人们的脸上渐渐露出了笑容。特别是听人说，很多种籽还是从东北运来的，许多人有一点惊讶；然而，他们也就立刻想到，毛主席领导的人民国家有着多么巨大的力量啊！不久，阜阳专署派人到沫河口设立治河指挥部，并且向群众说明，毛主席已经指示要把淮河治好，消息马上传开了，无论是老年人和青年人听到，都非常欢喜，纷纷打听几时动工。就这样，原来还残留下的一点悲观失望的阴影，也就很快消失了。原来打算逃荒的，也不逃荒了；更有许多人正准备在河工开始后，在沿河一带作生意，或者正在修补船只，等将来运送粮草。
    像沫河口发生的事情，只不过是千百个村庄中的一个例子。灵璧县的灾民听到治河的消息后，许多人立刻修造船只，准备运粮草；五河县盲目逃荒出来的灾民，听说要“打坝子”，纷纷回到家乡；城关区交通街先后逃出九十多人，九月初已自动回去三十多人；五北区逃出两千多人，也已回来一半多。有些老年人根据多少年的经验，还对治淮工程提出了他们的意见。他们向干部说：“光打坝子不行，必须把正阳关和下山口治一治（指疏浚两地附近的河道）。”
    在五河县境内，曾经发生过这样一件事。该县县委书记下乡检查救灾工作，因为临时刮风，船行困难，就住宿在一个村子里。该村的老乡们为了知道一点更多的治河消息，就派人去请他召开一个会，向大家讲一讲打坝子（指修堤）的事。县委书记把毛主席怎样关怀灾民，指示治好淮河的事，向到会的人详细的说明了。老乡们异常兴奋，许多人都说：“这一下有办法了！”
