Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 1st. TASS reported from Moscow today: Pravda published an editorial today entitled "First Anniversary of the People's Republic of China".

The editorial stated: Today is the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Hundreds of millions of Chinese people are celebrating this anniversary as the brightest and happiest festival. All progressive mankind joins them in commemorating this significant day.

Pravda continued: The victory of the Chinese revolution has immeasurably strengthened the front of peace, democracy, and socialism, dealt an irresistible blow to the entire imperialist system, and encouraged the people of colonial and dependent countries to fight for their freedom and national independence.

The Chinese people are celebrating the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in an atmosphere of tremendous political and industrial upsurge. Industry—the foundation of China's economic independence—is recovering smoothly. The long-standing financial chaos has been eliminated, and prices have been stabilized.

As a result of land reform, Chinese peasants have obtained 37 million hectares of land from the People's Democratic Republic. The land reform currently being implemented is transforming the Chinese countryside. Chinese peasants have personally seen that only the Communist Party and the new democratic government truly represent the interests of the people.

The material well-being and cultural level of the working masses are steadily improving.

All the victories of the Chinese working people are due to their Communist Party. The Communist Party of China, under the leadership of its long-tested leader Mao Zedong, has opened up the road to freedom, happiness, and socialism for its people.

The achievements of the Chinese people vividly demonstrate the strong vitality of the Chinese people's democratic system and indisputably prove its superiority over the old anti-people regime, which paralyzed the energy of the working masses, suffocated and destroyed the talents of the people, and subjected hundreds of millions of people to poverty and ignorance.

In the past year, more profound events have occurred in China than in the past few centuries or even millennia.

The outstanding event of the past year was the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, followed by various agreements. The close friendship and cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries have created conditions for the rapid improvement of the Chinese economy and increased the strength of peace, democracy, and socialism. As part of the great socialist democratic camp headed by the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China defends the peace and security of all countries. In the new China, 120 million people have signed the Stockholm Appeal. The American and British warmongers are furious at the failure of their aggressive policy towards China. They refuse to recognize the historic victory of the Chinese revolution and are now plotting to enslave China and suppress the national liberation movement in Asia. The direct aggression by the United States against Korea and Taiwan, the repeated violations of the borders of the People's Republic of China by the U.S. Air Force, discrimination against the democratic new China in the United Nations, and support for Chiang Kai-shek's corrupt clique—all these indicate that the American and British imperialists have not abandoned their crazy idea of enslaving China and other countries in the East. The Chinese people firmly declare that they will not allow anyone to infringe on their legitimate rights or violate the national sovereignty and independence of the People's Republic of China.

On this glorious first anniversary, the Chinese people declare that they ardently love peace, but they have never been afraid, and will never be afraid, to repulse aggression in order to defend peace.

Pravda wrote in conclusion: The proud Chinese people, aware of the great historical task they are undertaking, are confidently advancing along the road of building a strong and independent people's democratic China under the leadership of the Communist Party and its leader Mao Zedong. On the first anniversary of the People's Republic of China, we extend fraternal greetings to the great Chinese people!

　　中华人民共和国一周年
    ——真理报社论摘要
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科一日讯：真理报今日以“中华人民共和国一周年”为题发表社论。
    社论说：今天是中华人民共和国成立一周年纪念日。数以亿计的中国人民正在把这个周年纪念日当作最光明最快乐的节日来庆祝。全体进步人类和他们共同纪念这一个意义重大的日子。
    真理报继称：中国革命的胜利，无限量地加强了和平、民主与社会主义的阵线，使整个帝国主义体系遭受了不可抵挡的打击，并且鼓励了殖民地及附属国的人民为争取他们的自由和民族独立而斗争。
    中国人民在巨大的政治及工业高涨的气氛中庆祝人民共和国成立一周年纪念日。工业——中国经济独立的基础——正在顺利地恢复中。长期存在的财经混乱已经消除，物价已经稳定了。
    土地改革的结果，中国农民已从人民民主国取得三千七百万公顷的土地。现在实施的土地改革正在改变中国的农村。中国农民已亲身看到，代表人民真正利益的，只有共产党及新的民主政府。
    劳动群众的物质福利及文化水平正稳步改进中。
    中国劳动人民所有的一切胜利都归功于他们的共产党。久经考验的领袖毛泽东领导下的中国共产党，已为它的人民开辟了到达自由、幸福的道路，以及到社会主义的道路。
    中国人民的成就，就生动地证明了中国人民民主制度的强烈的活力，并无可置辩地证明，这一制度对旧的反人民政权的优越性。旧的反人民政权瘫痪了劳动群众的精力，窒息与毁损了人民的才能，并使亿万人民生活于贫困及愚昧之中。
    在去年一年之中，中国发生了比过去几百年甚至几千年都多的具有深刻意义的事件。
    去年一年中的突出的事件是苏联和中华人民共和国之间的友好同盟互助条约以及继之而来的各项协定的签订。中华人民共和国和苏联以及人民民主国家之间的密切的友谊和合作为中国经济的迅速提高创造了条件，并且增加了和平、民主和社会主义的力量。中华人民共和国作为以伟大的苏联为首的伟大社会主义民主阵营的一部分，捍卫着各国的和平与安全。在新中国，已有一亿二千万人在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。美英战争贩子们由于他们对中国的侵略政策遭受失败而恼羞成怒。就拒不承认中国革命的历史性的胜利，现在正在策划奴役中国和镇压亚洲民族解放运动的计划。美国对朝鲜和台湾的直接侵略行为，美国空军一再侵犯中华人民共和国边境的行为，在联合国中对民主的新中国的歧视，对蒋介石腐朽集团的支持——这一切都表示：美英帝国主义者并没有放弃他们奴役中国和东方其他国家的疯狂想法。中国人民坚决宣布：他们将不容许任何人侵害他们的合法权利、以及侵犯中华人民共和国的国家主权和独立。
    中国人民在这个光荣的一周年纪念日宣布：他们热烈爱好和平，但为了保卫和平他们从来不曾害怕，也永远不会害怕击退侵略。
    真理报在结语中写道：认识到他们所从事的重大历史性任务的自豪的中国人民，正在共产党及其领袖毛泽东的领导下满怀信心地沿着建设一个强大独立的人民民主的中国的道路前进。在中华人民共和国一周年纪念日，向伟大的中国人民致兄弟般的敬礼！
