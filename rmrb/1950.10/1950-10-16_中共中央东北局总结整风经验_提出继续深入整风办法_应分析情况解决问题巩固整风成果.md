　　Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Summarizes Rectification Experiences
    Proposes Methods for Continuing In-Depth Rectification
    Analyzing Situations, Solving Problems, and Consolidating Rectification Results
    [Our Newspaper] The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee summarized the rectification movement in the entire Northeast region at the end of September and issued instructions on how to continue the rectification in the future. On October 10th, the Northeast Daily published an editorial entitled "Solving Problems and Deepening the Rectification Movement," analyzing the current situation of the rectification movement in the Northeast and proposing solutions for various problems. According to the summary instructions of the Northeast Bureau and the editorial of the Northeast Daily, the situation of the rectification movement in the Northeast is as follows: By mid-September, the rectification, which mainly involved cadres above the section chief level in various departments and commissions at the Northeast level, and various departments, halls, and bureaus at the provincial and municipal levels, had come to a preliminary end; various bureaus and divisions and various enterprise companies at the Northeast level are in progress. Various state-owned factories and mines are just beginning; at the county committee level, except for Rehe and Liaoxi, which have just started, other counties have basically ended by the end of September. The gains of the rectification are: overcoming the phenomena of complacency and inertia in some departments, strengthening cadres' policy viewpoints, and recognizing the importance of connecting with the masses and delving into work.
    During this period of the rectification movement, there were three main situations:
    The first is to follow the spirit of the documents, check the work, find out the main key problems in the work of the departments, and propose solutions after analysis and research. As for formulating necessary systems and organizing forces to implement them, some departments have just started; some departments have not yet done so.
    The second is that some problems have been raised in the inspection work, and some solutions have also been proposed; however, important problems are still there without analysis and research, and no solutions can be proposed.
    The third is that some documents were read sloppily, and no serious inspection of work was carried out, so there was no way to discover important problems; it was just "a chat and then it was over." Some units separated rectification from current work, and when work was busy, rectification was squeezed out; or, although the rectification was completed, the problems in the work were not resolved, and the work style was still the same old way.
    Among the above three situations, the second is more common, the third accounts for a very small number, and the first is also a minority. The units directly controlled by the Northeast Bureau and the provincial and municipal party committees are in better condition.
  Two main problems were exposed during the rectification:
  Insufficient study and research of policies, and poor understanding and analysis of the situation
    In this stage of the rectification, the problems that urgently need to be solved in the work of various departments in the Northeast were exposed: there is a pure "task" viewpoint in the work. In order to complete the task, no attention is paid to policies and no means are chosen, pursuing form and quantity without emphasizing quality. In various economic departments, in addition to the pure "task" viewpoint, there are also supply system thinking and departmentalism, lacking the concept of economic accounting. There is an adventurous idea of ​​being eager for success in the basic construction work of industry, without considering the size of subjective forces, regardless of whether the objective situation is possible. In rural work, there are remnants of agricultural socialist ideology such as inappropriately restricting new rich peasants, discriminating against individual (non-mutual aid group) farmers, infringing on the interests of middle peasants in production and disaster relief, and favoring large groups in labor mutual aid. In trade policy, many inappropriate restrictions are imposed on private merchants, with the idea of ​​monopolizing or even squeezing out private merchants; the work of provincial and county cooperatives is not oriented towards grassroots cooperatives and solving the needs of members, but a pure idea of ​​business profit. In terms of work methods, there are bureaucratic work styles of not investigating and researching, not proceeding from reality, copying and reciting resolutions of higher authorities, talking empty words and not solving practical problems, and old-fashioned empiricism that is busy all day long and lacks a keen sense of new things, as well as suppressing democracy, fear of criticism and self-criticism, etc., which are relatively serious problems in various tasks. These problems can be summarized into two main points: one is insufficient study and research of policies; the other is poor understanding and analysis of the actual situation. As a result, policies are divorced from the situation, making a lot of work become empty slogans or reduced to formality, and various forms of commandism arise from this. The root causes of these work styles are mainly weak policy viewpoints and mass viewpoints. After analysis and research, people have a deeper understanding of the damage and harm caused by these ideological work styles and their roots. Some complacent cadres felt the seriousness of the problem after checking their work. Some departments have found the key to the problem and proposed improvement methods. Many cadres have solved the problem ideologically and increased their confidence in their work. In addition, some problems have not yet been resolved, such as in rural work, how to specifically solve certain policy issues and improve the leadership ability of cadres based on the new situation of this year's production development and the increase in people's purchasing power, and improve the old-fashioned one-size-fits-all work methods, etc., still need to be studied and determined.
  The main experience of this rectification:
  Checking work should start from reality, analyze the essence, and propose solutions
    The main experience of this stage of rectification in the Northeast region is, first of all, that checking work should start from reality. Various departments should conduct inspections and summaries based on the important problems in the main work of their departments, grasp the key problems, conduct inspections from top to bottom and from bottom to top, and combine them with on-site inspections as much as possible; the rectification must be deep and thorough, especially to solve problems. Whether the problem can be solved depends on the leadership. When checking work, avoid being unfocused and involving too wide a range; or using bureaucratic methods to rectify, vaguely opposing bureaucracy and commandism.
    Secondly, the central task of the Northeast is economic construction, but the majority of cadres do not understand or are not familiar with many specific policies in economic construction. The leadership should focus on the rectification of economic departments, focusing on checking the effectiveness of work, checking the implementation of policies, and rectifying work styles. If other departments do not have strong leadership, it is estimated that rectification is not easy to go deep, and may even be messed up, then it is better to postpone it until the leadership has the strength to rectify it.
    Thirdly, according to this stage of experience, the rectification of cadres at the city and county levels and above should generally deepen gradually according to the following steps: start by studying several basic documents and carrying out rectification mobilization to make cadres understand the purpose and direction of the rectification and inspire their enthusiasm; the leading core (party committee and party group) should specifically understand the basic problems existing in their own and their subordinate departments, determine what to rectify and what requirements to achieve. After the leadership has clear ideological preparation, they should immediately conduct inspection work. In the inspection work, they should fully promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and according to the problems found out, conduct analysis and summary, clarify the key issues in policy viewpoints and work style, and propose solutions and improvement methods. Then guarantee and implement it by improving work style and establishing necessary systems. Only in this way can the rectification be deepened and the results of the rectification be consolidated.
    Fourth, it is easy to find problems in the rectification, but it is a more difficult task to analyze and study these problems, grasp the essence, propose solutions and implement them. The leadership should specifically help cadres improve their ability to analyze and solve problems. Avoid being satisfied with finding problems without conducting analysis and research, resulting in the failure to solve the problems and the rectification becoming empty talk.
  How to continue to deepen the rectification in the future?
  Problems should be solved separately according to different situations, and criticism and self-criticism should be carried out correctly
    Regarding how to continue to deepen the rectification in the future, the Northeast Bureau pointed out in its instructions:
    First of all, according to three different situations, problems should be solved and rectification situations should be improved separately: 1. For those who have grasped the key problems in the rectification and proposed solutions, they should organize forces, stipulate steps, implement the spirit of rectification, improve work, and conduct regular inspections and summaries of work according to specific circumstances. 2. For those who have raised problems but have not found the key and solutions, they should conduct analysis and research, find the key, propose solutions, stipulate necessary systems, and organize forces to implement them. 3. For a small number of departments where the rectification is divorced from reality, or although the rectification has been carried out but the problems have not been resolved, the responsible comrades should earnestly review, and according to the spirit of rectification, make an enlightening rectification report that has policy thinking, analysis, self-criticism, and can solve specific problems. Then read the designated documents, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and check and summarize the work.
    Secondly, in this inspection work, it was exposed that many cadres do not understand policies and do not act according to policies; higher levels also have a general and vague leadership over lower levels, with more requests for tasks and less explanation of policies and methods. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen cadres' policy learning in the future, and at the same time, it is necessary to correct the bad work style of some leading organs not conveying important instructions and decisions from higher levels or copying and reciting them.
    Thirdly, regarding the improvement of work style, emphasis should be placed on fully promoting democracy, correctly carrying out criticism and self-criticism; advocating seeking truth from facts, being good at proceeding from reality, frequently studying new situations and new things, overcoming the pure "task" viewpoint and old-fashioned work style, and conducting comprehensive and focused leadership, so as to be clear about the center, accurately grasp the situation, have a clear understanding, have foresight, learn specific and accurate methods of solving problems, overcome one-size-fits-all, and oppose talking empty words.
    Finally, in order to consolidate the results of the rectification, attention should be paid in the organization to discovering talents in the rectification, promoting loyal and talented cadres to appropriate positions; those who have committed serious mistakes should be sent to the competent authorities for handling according to the circumstances; establish practical and feasible inspection agencies and inspection systems, and improve inspection work methods; conscientiously improve the party committee system and the party representative conference system, and promote the party congress and the periodic re-election of the party committee from bottom to top in a step-by-step manner; strengthen and improve the work of party branches and the branch life of cadres in various leading departments. The rectification of industrial and commercial enterprises should implement the reports and summaries of the Northeast Bureau's industrial conference and commercial conference, combine with their own specific circumstances, find the key problems, and make improvement decisions.

### 中共中央东北局总结整风经验  提出继续深入整风办法  应分析情况解决问题巩固整风成果

　　中共中央东北局总结整风经验
    提出继续深入整风办法
    应分析情况解决问题巩固整风成果
    【本报讯】中共中央东北局于九月底总结东北全区整风运动并对今后如何继续进行整风发出指示。十月十日东北日报以“解决问题，深入整风运动”为题发表社论，分析目前东北整风运动情况，分别提出解决问题办法。综合东北局总结指示与东北日报社论，东北整风运动的情况是：九月中旬，东北一级各部委，省市一级各部、厅、局科长以上干部为主的整风，已初步结束；东北一级各局处、各企业公司正在进行中。各国营工厂矿山正在开始；县委一级除热河辽西刚开始外，其他各县九月底已告一段落。整风的收获是：克服了某些部门自满自足与疲塌的现象，加强了干部的政策观点和认识了联系群众、深入工作的重要。
    在这一段整风运动中有以下三种主要情况：
    第一种是按照文件精神，检查工作，找出部门工作中的主要关键问题，经过分析研究，提出解决方法。至于制定必要制度，组织力量贯彻执行，有的部门还刚刚开始；有的部门还没有做。
    第二种是在检查工作中提出了若干问题也提出了一些解决办法；但是重要问题还放在那里没有分析研究，也提不出解决办法。
    第三种是潦草地读了一些文件，既没有认真检查工作，因而也就无从发现重要问题；只是“清谈一下，谈完了事”。有的单位把整风与当前工作分开，工作一忙，就把整风挤掉了；或者，虽是整完了风，但工作中的问题并没有解决，工作作风还是老一套。
    以上三种情况中，以第二种较为普遍，第三种占极少数，第一种也是少数。其中由东北局与省市党委直接掌握的单位情况较好。
  整风中暴露了两个主要问题：
  对政策的学习研究不够对情况的了解分析很差
    在这一阶段整风中，暴露了东北各部门工作中极需解决的问题是：在工作中有单纯“任务”观点，为完成任务，不讲政策不择方式，追求形式与数量而不重质量。在各经济部门中除单纯“任务”观点外，还有供给制思想与本位主义，缺乏经济核算观点。工业基本建设工作中有急于求成的冒险思想，不考虑主观力量大小，不管客观情况是否可能。农村工作中则有不适当的限制新富农，歧视单干（不参加互助组的）农民，生产救灾中侵犯中农利益，劳动互助中喜好搞大组等农业社会主义思想残余。贸易政策中对私商规定许多不适当的限制，有垄断甚至挤垮私商的思想；省县合作社工作不是面向基层社与解决社员需要，而是单纯的经商营利思想。在工作方法上存在不调查研究不从实际出发，照抄与背诵上级决议，说空话不解决实际问题的官僚主义作风，和终日忙碌对新事物缺乏锐敏感觉的老一套的经验主义作风，以及压制民主，害怕批评与自我批评等等，都是各种工作中比较严重存在的问题。这些问题归纳起来主要有两点，一是对于政策的学习与研究不够；一是对实际情况了解与分析很差。因之政策与情况脱节，使很多工作形成空喊或流于形式，各种各样的命令主义，也由此而生。产生这些作风的根源，主要是政策观点与群众观点不强。经过分析研究，对这些思想作风给予工作的损失危害及其产生的根源，有了较深刻的认识，有些自满的干部经过检查工作，才感到问题的严重。有的部门已找到了问题的关键，提出改进办法。不少干部从思想上解决了问题，增强了工作信心。另外有些问题尚未得到解决，如农村工作中，如何根据今年生产的发展与人民购买力提高的新情况，具体地解决若干政策问题及提高干部领导能力，改进老一套单打一的工作方法等，尚须研究确定。
  这次整风的主要经验：
  检查工作要从实际出发分析本质提出解决办法
    东北区这一阶段整风的主要经验，首先是检查工作要从实际出发。各部门应根据自己部门存在的主要工作中的重要问题，进行检查与总结，抓住关键问题，自上而下与自下而上展开检查，并根据可能与深入现场检查相结合；要整的深整的透，特别是要解决问题。能否解决问题，关键在于领导。检查工作切忌漫无中心，牵扯范围过广；或以官僚主义的方法整风，泛泛地反官僚主义、命令主义。
    其次，东北的中心任务是经济建设，而广大干部对经济建设中许多具体政策则多不懂或是不熟。领导上应抓紧经济部门的整风，着重从检查工作效果，检查政策执行情况整作风。其他部门如无较强的领导，估计整风不易深入，甚至可能搞乱时，则宁可推迟，俟领导有力量时再整。
    再次，根据这一段经验，市县级以上干部的整风，大体上应按以下步骤逐步深入：开始学习几个基本文件与进行整风动员，使干部弄清整风目的与方针，启发其积极性；领导核心（党委党组），要具体地弄清自己及所属各部门工作中存在的基本问题，确定整掉什么，达到何种要求。领导上有了明确的思想准备之后，应即进行检查工作。在检查工作中，应充分发扬民主，展开批评与自我批评，并根据检查出来的问题，进行分析总结，弄清政策观点与作风上的关键问题，提出解决与改进的办法。然后从改进作风、建立必要制度上加以保证和贯彻。这样整风才能深入，整风的成果才能巩固。
    第四、整风中发现问题容易，对这些问题进行分析研究，抓住本质，提出解决办法并贯彻实现则是较困难的工作。领导上应具体地帮助干部提高分析与解决问题的能力。切忌满足于发现问题，而不进行分析研究，结果问题不能解决，整风流于空谈。
  今后如何继续深入整风？
  应当根据不同情况分别解决问题并且正确地展开批评和自我批评
    今后如何继续深入整风，东北局指示中指出：
    首先，根据三种不同情况，分别进行解决问题与改进整风情况：一、整风中已抓住关键问题，提出解决办法的，应根据具体情况，组织力量，规定步骤，贯彻整风精神，改进工作，并定期检查与总结工作。二、已经提出问题而未找出关键与解决问题办法的，应进行分析研究，找出关键，提出解决办法，规定必要制度，并组织力量，贯彻下去。三、少数整风脱离实际，或虽已整过而未解决问题的部门，负责同志应认真检讨，根据整风精神，做出一个有政策思想、有分析、有自我批评精神，能解决具体问题的带启发性的整风报告。然后阅读指定文件，展开批评与自我批评，检查总结工作。
    第二、在此次检查工作中，暴露了不少干部不懂政策，不按政策办事；上级对下级也多是一般化的笼统的领导，要求任务多，交代政策与办法少。因此，今后必须加强干部政策学习，同时应纠正某些领导机关不传达上级重要指示决定或照抄背诵的恶劣作风。
    第三、关于改进作风，应着重于充分发扬民主，正确开展批评与自我批评；提倡实事求是，善于从实际出发，经常研究新情况和新事物，克服单纯“任务”观点和老一套作风，要进行全面而有重点的领导，作到中心明确，能准确掌握情况，心中有数，有预见性，学习具体而准确地解决问题的方法，克服单打一，反对说空话。
    最后，为了巩固整风成果，在组织上应注意在整风中发现人材，提拔忠实有才能的干部到适当岗位；对犯错误严重的应分别情节送主管机关处理；建立切实可行的检查机构和检查制度，改进检查工作方法；认真健全党委制与党代表会议制，有步骤地自下而上推行党代表大会与定期改选党委；加强与改进各领导部门党的支部工作与干部的支部生活。工商企业部门的整风，应贯彻东北局工业会议和商业会议的报告与总结，结合本身具体情况，找出关键问题，作出改进决定。
