Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th: After occupying Seoul, the American invading army and the Li Seung-man gang are carrying out a frenzied massacre under the slogan of "extermination." The butchers have established special agent organizations such as the so-called "Exterminate Communists Squad," "Anti-Communist Squad," and "Self-Government Squad," specializing in the massacre of patriotic democratic figures, families of the People's Volunteer Army, and innocent people. At 9:00 AM on September 28th, in the Zhongliang Bridge levee of Qingliangli outside Dongdaemun alone, more than 700 women and children were collectively shot and killed. The bodies of the dead were hung on telephone poles. The butchers also constantly broke into the homes of Seoul citizens, robbing property and raping women.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th: TASS, Moscow: Pravda correspondent Bo Chengke in Pyongyang wrote an article in the newspaper on the 6th, describing the atrocities of the savage American aggressors. He wrote: The American army is destroying the country's wealth. They are destroying factories with bombs weighing 1,000 kilograms, burning workshops, manufacturing plants, and mines. This kind of destruction is happening not only in the north but also in the south.

In describing the situation in Seoul, Bo Chengke wrote: Thousands of patriots are imprisoned in the "Seodaemun" prison; hundreds of guards in the city were hanged on lampposts. During the days of American military control of the city, they robbed everywhere and raped women. The black, charred ruins cover the city like a black veil.

The reporter then pointed out: The People's Army Command has withdrawn its troops to the north. The American army has occupied a large piece of land, but these American aggressors have imprisoned themselves on this land. Their army is advancing on desolate land. The residents have fled to the mountains and are now engaged in stubborn resistance, and have controlled all the roads. MacArthur previously hoped that the South Korean people would welcome his executioners with flowers, but his executioners were met not with flowers, but with bayonets and bullets. The Korean land is on fire under the feet of the occupiers. They have sown evil seeds, and they will eventually reap the bitter fruit.

　　美李匪帮侵占汉城后
    疯狂屠杀朝鲜人民
    刽子手们到处抢劫财物强奸妇女
    【新华社平壤十日电】侵占汉城的美国侵略军和李承晚匪帮，正在“斩尽杀绝”的口号下，进行疯狂的大屠杀。刽子手们成立了所谓“灭共队”、“反共队”、“自治队”等特务组织，专事屠杀爱国民主人士、义勇军家属与无辜人民。九月二十八日上午九时，仅在东大门外清凉里中良桥堤坊一地，就有七百余名妇女与儿童被集体枪杀。死者的尸体被挂在电线杆上。刽子手们并不断闯入汉城市民的住宅，抢劫财物和强奸妇女。
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报平壤记者波诚科六日在该报撰文，描述野蛮的美国侵略者的暴行。他写道：美国军队正在破坏这个国家的财富。他们正在用重达一千公斤的炸弹炸毁工厂，焚毁作坊、制造厂和矿山。这种破坏行为不但在北部是这样，在南部也是这样。
    波诚科在描述汉城的情况时写道：成千的爱国志士被囚禁在“西大门”监狱；该城的成百的守军被绞杀在灯柱上。在美军管制该城的几天中，他们到处抢劫和强奸妇女。黑色的烧焦了的废墟，好象黑纱似地覆盖着城市。
    记者接着指出：人民军司令部已把它的军队撤退到北方。美军占领了大块土地，但是这些美国侵略者却把他们自己囚禁在这块土地上了。他们的军队在荒凉的土地上前进。居民已跑到山里去，现在正在从事顽强的抵抗，并已控制了所有的道路。麦克阿瑟以前盼望南朝鲜人民用鲜花来欢迎他的刽子手们，但是他的刽子手们遇到的不是鲜花，而是刺刀和子弹。朝鲜陆地在占领者的脚下着火了。他们已种下恶因，他们最后一定会自食其果。
