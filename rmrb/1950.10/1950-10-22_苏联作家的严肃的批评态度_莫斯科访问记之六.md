　　Soviet Writers' Serious Attitude Towards Criticism
    ——Notes from a Visit to Moscow, Part 6
    Liu Baiyu

    During my visit to Soviet writers and literary institutions, the serious attitude of Soviet writers towards criticism left a very deep impression on me.

    I think I should first talk about a meeting of the Presidium of the Soviet Writers' Union.

    That day was June 19th. After lingering in Mayakovsky's former residence for half a day, we rushed to the Writers' Association on Vorovsky Street at 4 p.m. When we went upstairs, the meeting had already begun. Simonov led us into the Presidium meeting room. Soviet writers greeted us with warm applause to express their sincere respect. This meeting was convened by the Writers' Union, taking advantage of the opportunity that the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union was holding a meeting—writers from all allied republics and nationalities had come to Moscow. The Presidium convened this enlarged meeting to discuss literary issues of various nationalities. The meeting room was full of Soviet writers such as Tikhonov, Basi Qiao夫, Gliva Qiao夫, and Goroznikov. The poet Surkov presided over the meeting at one end of the long table. Klimovich, Chairman of the National Literature Committee of the Writers' Union, had already delivered a report to the conference at the beginning of the meeting, and was now sitting next to the Presidium, listening and taking notes. A female writer was speaking. Listening to it, I immediately understood how strict Soviet writers are in discussing issues with a high degree of political and principled stance. What we participated in was actually a critical meeting. Everyone believed that the report of the National Literature Committee was unsatisfactory and gave it strict criticism.

    In fact, this serious attitude towards criticism is not only manifested in meetings, but more profoundly implemented in every writer.

    I remember when I met with Polevoy, he told me this. Regarding criticism, he summarized that Soviet writers can receive three types of criticism after publishing their works to correct their shortcomings and errors:

    The first comes from the editorial departments of magazines;

    The second comes from comments within the literary circles;

    The third, which he considers the best and most important, is the criticism from the people.

    I visited the editorial departments of *Znamya* (*The Banner*) and *Literaturnaya Gazeta* (*Literary Gazette*) in Moscow. The Soviet magazine editorial departments and publishing departments are constantly and seriously responsible to the Soviet people politically and artistically. We shouldn't forget that at a Party meeting of the Writers' Union, Simonov made a sincere and responsible self-criticism for *Novy Mir* (*New World*) publishing *The River of Fire* and *The Merit of Beketov*? He said: "When the magazine's editorial department was studying and analyzing the script *The River of Fire*, it did not carry out this work to the end, and did not examine the correctness of the production problem on which the script was based." The person in charge of *Znamya* told me: The Soviet people have high demands on literary works. When writers submit manuscripts to the editorial department, the editorial department carefully studies them, puts forward opinions, and often spends six months to a year to revise the works. In short, the magazine's editorial department is responsible for correcting errors in the works not only after publication but also before publication. The magazine's editorial department has adopted a mass line and a new method of criticism for this purpose. The novel about the life of fishermen published in the fourth issue of *Znamya* was discussed not only by the editors but also by experts - Stakhanovites in the fishing industry.

    On July 21st, at the *Literary Gazette* office, we entered the editorial office of the literary criticism group of the literary and artistic section. As soon as I walked in, I was suddenly stunned. It turned out that the room was crowded with people, smelled of tobacco, and was holding a lively meeting, but they were not writers, but Red Army officers, and several Soviet Hero medals were shining on their chests. After the introduction, I shook hands with a young and handsome officer—this was Soviet Hero B. B. Pavlov, a prominent guerrilla warfare hero in the Soviet-German War. Sigagan was the commander of a special guerrilla unit. Colonel Lingof was a Soviet Hero. Starilov, a guerrilla colonel. Yurkin was an excellent guerrilla fighter. It turned out that they were invited by *Literary Gazette* to discuss a book describing the guerrilla war, entitled *Advance to the Carpathian Mountains*. The author Vershigora's experience is very interesting. He was a photographer before the war, became a general of the guerrillas during the war, and became a writer after the war. His first work, *People with Pure Conscience*, won the Stalin Prize. He wrote a second work, *Advance to the Carpathian Mountains*. Now, the *Literary Gazette* editorial department has invited people with rich experience in guerrilla warfare to conduct a discussion. A few days later, I went to the *Literary Gazette* again and asked how the discussion went. They told me that the heroes of the guerrilla war believed that the author's second work was an improvement over the first, and it was very interesting to read. The author corrected the shortcomings pointed out by the Party newspaper in the first work, which failed to adequately portray the Party's leadership in the guerrilla war. There was progress in the portrayal of characters and the description of the natural environment, but this artistic skill was not balanced throughout the book. At the same time, they raised important criticisms, believing that the life of guerrilla warfare was not fully portrayed. The *Literary Gazette* editorial department attached great importance to their opinions and was preparing to write a commentary based on these opinions.

    This mass line of literary criticism is widely used in Soviet literary circles. For example, the *Literary Gazette* went to an industrial area in Ukraine to discuss Azhayev's *Far from Moscow*, which describes life in the Far East. They invited university students in Moscow to discuss Dabrovolewski's *Renya Mostsova*, which portrays the lives of people in higher education and scientific institutions. After *Znamya* published the young writer Nionlov's novel about a female pilot, it was protested by female pilots, who believed that the author had not completed his plan and had not written well. The editorial department is inviting female pilots to discuss it so that the author can revise or rewrite it.

    So, what attitude does a Soviet writer take towards these criticisms?

    We should firmly remember that Fadeyev, when giving examples in every critical article, first criticized his own *The Young Guard*, and now he has revised *The Young Guard*. I think this is a model for revolutionary, Party writers, and literary leaders. After Bubennov strictly criticized Kataev's novel *For Soviet Power* for serious errors in *Pravda*, Kataev admitted his errors and publicly expressed his determination to revise it to the Soviet people. When Polevoy talked about the three types of criticism, he said almost in a happy tone: The opinions from the people are the best and most important opinions. I wrote in my visit notes: "He patted the bundle of things and told me: These are the three thousand letters received from Soviet readers after *A Real Man* was published. He said: 'This weighs fifty kilograms... They are not polite words, but strict criticisms. This is the best criticism, this is criticism from the people. In a socialist country, an ordinary worker can criticize a scientist, which prevents the scientist from closing himself off and makes him closely connected with reality. Why isn't the work printed into a book immediately after it is published in a magazine? Because it needs to be revised after receiving readers' criticisms.'" But he also gave such an example: He once vividly described in *A Real Man* that when Meresiev was crawling in the forest, he encountered a bear, and the bear sniffed his body full of gasoline and left. But after it was published, an aviation mechanic wrote and said: The type of plane that Meresiev was driving would not get full of gasoline at all. He said: Unless your bear's nose has a problem. When I wrote this, I still deeply remember that when Polevoy talked to a foreign writer about the sharp criticisms that the masses made of him, his attitude was so calm and natural. I think this is a good quality of revolutionary, Party writers, and it is the attitude of writers being responsible to the people.

    In fact, Soviet literary and artistic works are growing and maturing with their unique close connection with the masses, under the care, supervision, and criticism of the masses. I remember that Fadeyev said at a symposium of Chinese writers in Beijing: If a writer only looks at his own works and does not look at other people's works, then no one will read his works. During my visit to Moscow, I understood the meaning of this sentence more deeply. A Soviet writer has no so-called "personal" way out if he leaves the Soviet people as a whole. Strict criticism can help the writer remove the original shortcomings in your work, so that your work becomes a complete work of art. A person who has the courage to write better is willing to absorb such criticism anytime, anywhere.

    A Soviet university student told me: There is no literary work, no movie, that young people do not watch, strictly discuss, and offer opinions. The opinions of young people are often the sharpest criticisms, and for this reason, they are highly valued by writers. Therefore, every work by Soviet writers will be quickly criticized after it is published. For example, *Novy Mir* published Lyubov Gabo's novel *On the Other Side of the Dniester*. Gabo is a young teacher in Moscow, but he is very familiar with the life on the other side of the Dniester. He described the situation in the first few years of the Soviet regime there. Soon, he received a critical article from Ilyashev from Gorky City, pointing out the advantages of the novel, that it truthfully described the real events of the young Soviet, and how a new consciousness grew in the struggle between the people and the old ruling ideology, becoming Soviet people. But, at the same time, it criticized the writer's failure in using language. When Soviet Red Army soldiers discuss a certain work, they often invite the writer to participate. The army likes writers very much, and considers writers to be their friends. But, at the same time, there are organizations in the army that specialize in criticizing literary works. In order to ensure the correctness of the works, literary magazine editorial departments also send works that express war life to the General Staff Headquarters or the troops being described for review. *Literary Gazette* also frequently takes its editorial plans to factories, collective farms, and schools to ask the masses to discuss and supplement their opinions. Soviet literature and art are not only combined with the people in expressing the reality of struggle, but also closely combined with the people in terms of criticism. The people are the creators of real life, and they are guaranteeing the correctness and development of Soviet literature and art with their criticism.

    Currently, the leading issue being developed in Soviet literary criticism is, as the title of an essay states:

    "Struggle for Bolshevik Partisanship and for the High Artistic Skills of Soviet Literature!"

    *Literary Gazette* is the organ newspaper of the Writers' Union, and it constantly pays attention to the leadership of theory and criticism. For the above leading issue, it has recently successively published essays on issues such as artistic language, the form of Soviet poetry, and novel structure. In particular, the essay *On Problems of Literary Criticism* by Gavayichika, Chairman of the Literary Criticism Committee of the Writers' Union, reviewed the works in various literary magazines in the past six months, and proposed how to study the Mayakovsky line in poetry and how to evaluate works not only from content but also from artistic form. This essay attracted wide attention from readers. *Literary Gazette* frequently reviews the literary magazines *Oktyabr* (*October*), *Znamya*, *Novy Mir*, as well as the literary publications of various allied republics and nationalities, and the works published in them, encouraging the valuable aspects of these magazines and criticizing their shortcomings. This criticism, in short, is to strive for the combination of high ideological content and high artistry in Soviet literary works, to educate the people with communist morality, to express the new progressive things in the lives of the Soviet people, and to expose and criticize the remnants of old consciousness. At the same time, literary magazines also guide writers on the road of serving the people's struggle. For example, *Literary Gazette* is preparing to publish an article called *The Contribution of Soviet Literature and Art in Defending Peace*.

    Now, let us return to the enlarged meeting of the Presidium of the Writers' Union.

    As an example, I recorded a fragment of a speech I heard from a speaker. Karabenikov, - the editor of *Friendship of the Peoples*, he criticized the report of the National Literature Committee: "It failed to point out the important role of national literature in the struggle to defend peace, and the great efforts made by various nationalities in studying the literary history of various nationalities; it did not particularly introduce Umit - this prolific theorist, especially his works on socialist realism; it did not point out the shortcomings of Lesilenka's article *On Gorky and Yanka Kupala*, in order to help the progress of this young theorist." He finally strictly criticized that the reason why the report was unsatisfactory was because "usually not enough attention is paid to the study of national literature." He believed that "this working style should attract the attention of the National Literature Committee." I give this example, and the reader naturally understands that it is not to illustrate the shortcomings in that kind of work, but to illustrate how strict and straightforward criticism is carried out among Soviet writers, to illustrate the principled atmosphere among Soviet writers, and to illustrate the political quality of Soviet writers.

    At the same time, we remember that since Zhdanov's reports on literature, art, and philosophy, Soviet literature has been leaping forward, brilliant and magnificent, by constantly exposing and correcting shortcomings in its work.

    At that day's meeting, Simonov sat beside us. When Karabenikov spoke the last few words, Simonov sincerely said to us: "Look! - Soviet writers are so strict in criticism."

　　苏联作家的严肃的批评态度
    ——莫斯科访问记之六
    刘白羽
    在我访问苏联作家与文学机构时，苏联作家严肃的批评态度，给我留下极深刻的印象。
    我想我应该先谈到苏联作家协会主席团的一次会议。
    那天是六月十九日，我们在马雅柯夫斯基故居盘桓了半日，下午四点钟，赶到瓦罗夫斯基街的作家协会，走到楼上，会议早已开始了。西蒙诺夫引我们走进主席团的会议室，苏联作家与我们以热烈的鼓掌互致衷心的敬意。这次会议，是作家协会趁着苏联最高苏维埃代表会议开会，——各联盟国、各民族都有作家来到了莫斯科的机会，主席团召开这一扩大会议，讨论关于各民族的文学问题。会议室内，坐满苏联作家如吉洪诺夫、巴西巧夫、葛利巴巧夫、戈若尼可夫等。诗人苏尔可夫在长桌的一端主持会议。作家协会民族文学委员会主席克里莫维支，在会议开始时，已向大会做了报告，现在正坐在主席团旁边，一面倾听，一面记录。一位女作家正在发言。听下来，我立刻明白，苏联作家是多么严格的，以高度政治性、原则性来讨论问题。我们所参加的，实际上是一个批评的会议。大家认为民族文学委员会的报告不能令人满意，而给以严格的批评。
    事实上，这种严肃的批评态度不仅表现在会议上，而更深刻地贯彻在每一个作家身上。
    我记得，和波列伏依会面时，他曾经这样告诉我。关于批评，他归纳起来讲，苏联作家发表作品，可以得到三种批评，来纠正他的缺点与错误：
    第一种，来自杂志编辑部；
    第二种，来自文学界之间的评论；
    第三种，他认为是最好的、也是最重要的一种批评，是来自人民中的批评。
    我在莫斯科访问过《旗》和《文学报》编辑部。苏联的杂志编辑部与出版部，对苏联人民是经常严肃地负着政治与艺术上的责任的。我们该不会忘记，在作家协会一次党的会议上，西蒙诺夫不是为了《新世纪》发表了《火河》及《别凯托夫的功名》而进行过诚恳负责的自我批评吗？他说：“杂志编辑部在研究分析剧本《火河》时，没有把这一工作进行到底，没有把那个作为剧本基础的生产问题之正确性加以检查。”《旗》的负责人告诉我：苏联人民对于文学作品要求很高，作家交稿到编辑部来，编辑部慎重研究，提出意见，常常要半年——一年，来对作品进行修改工作。总之，杂志编辑部对于作品，不仅在发表后，而在发表前，就负责地改正其错误。杂志编辑部为此采取了群众路线的、新的批评方法。《旗》杂志在第四期上发表一篇写渔人生活的小说，就是不但由编辑，而且邀了专家——渔业中的斯太哈诺夫运动者，共同来讨论了这篇小说。
    七月二十一日，在《文学报》社，我们走进了文学艺术版文学批评组的编辑室。一走进去，我忽然怔住了。原来，这屋里挤满人，有烟草气味，正在热烈地进行会议，但，不是作家，而是红军军官，而且，在他们胸上闪烁着好几枚苏联英雄章。经过介绍，我和一位年青英俊的军官握手，——这是苏联英雄Ｂ·Ｂ·巴甫洛夫，苏德战争中杰出的游击战英雄。西加根是特种游击队的司令员。林果夫上校是苏联英雄。斯达里洛夫，游击队上校。犹尔金是一个优秀的游击队员。原来，他们是被《文学报》邀请来讨论一本描写游击战争的书，这书名：《向喀尔巴阡山挺进》。作者维尔什果拉的经历是非常有趣的。他战前是摄影师，战争中成为游击队的将军，战后成为作家，他的第一部著作《纯洁良心的人》获得斯大林奖金。他又写了第二部著作《向喀尔巴阡山挺进》。现在，《文学报》编辑部请了有丰富游击战争生活经验的人来进行讨论。数日后，我再到《文学报》社，问到那次讨论的结果如何？他们告诉我，游击战争的英雄们认为作者的第二部作品比第一部作品有了进步，读起来很有兴趣。作者纠正了第一部作品曾经被党报指出的、未很好表现游击战争中党的领导的那种缺点，在表现人物性格与描写自然环境上有进步，可是，这种艺术技巧在全书中表现得不平衡。同时，他们提出了重要的批评，他们认为未把游击战争生活全面地表现出来。《文学报》编辑部极重视他们的意见，准备根据这意见写成评论文章。
    这种群众路线的文学批评方式，在苏联文学界是被广泛运用的。比如，《文学报》到乌克兰一个工业区去讨论阿扎耶夫描写远东生活的《远离莫斯科的地方》。邀请莫斯科的大学生，讨论达布洛渥列斯基表现高等教育机关与科学机关人员生活的《任尼亚莫斯洛娃》。《旗》发表了青年作家尼昂洛夫的描写女飞机师的小说后，受到了女飞机师们的抗议，她们认为作者没有完成自己的计划，写得不好，编辑部正邀请女飞机师来讨论，好让作者去修改或重写。
    那么，一个苏联作家用什么态度来对待这些批评呢？
    我们应该牢牢记住，法捷耶夫在每一批评文章中举例时，都首先批评到他自己的《青年近卫军》，而且现在他已经修改了《青年近卫军》，我认为这是革命的、党的作家、文艺领导者的典范。布宾诺夫在《真理报》上严格地批判了卡达耶夫的小说《拥护苏维埃政权》的严重错误后，卡达耶夫承认了他的错误，而且，对苏联人民公开表示自己决心修改。波列伏依说到那三种批评时，他几乎以一种幸福的声调说：来自人民中的意见，是最好的，最重要的意见。我在他的访问记上写过：“他拍着那捆东西告诉我：这是《真正的人》发表后，收到苏联读者的三千封信。他说：‘这有五十基罗克兰姆重了，……它们不是讲客气话，而是严格的批评。这是最好的批评，这是来自人民中间的批评。在社会主义国家中，一个普通工人可以批评一个科学家，这样就使科学家不自己关闭起来，而与现实密切联系起来。为什么作品在杂志上发表后不马上印成书呢？就因为要得到读者批评后，再加以修改。’”但他还举出这样的例子：他曾经在《真正的人》中生动地描写了密里席耶夫在森林中爬行时遇到一只熊，熊嗅了嗅他满身汽油气味就走了。可是发表后，一个空军机械师来信说：密里席耶夫所架驶的那种飞机，根本不会弄得满身汽油气味，他说：除非你那个熊的鼻子有毛病。在我这样写的时候，我还深刻记得，波列伏依当他对一个外国的作家谈到群众对他这样尖锐的批评时，他的态度是那样平静、自然。我觉得这是革命的、党的作家的好品质，是作家对人民负责的态度。
    实际上，苏维埃文学艺术作品，正以它与群众特有的密切联系，在群众爱护、监督与批评中生长，成熟的。我记得，法捷耶夫在北京参加中国作家的一次座谈会上，他说过：一个作家只看自己的作品，不看别人的作品，结果他的作品也不会有人看。在莫斯科的访问中，使我更深刻地理解这句话的含意。一个苏联作家离开苏联人民整体，是没有所谓“个人”的出路的。严格的批评，正可以帮助作家把你作品中原有的缺点去掉，使你的作品成为完整的艺术品。一个有勇气写得更好的人，是随时随地，愿意吸收这样的批评的。
    一个苏联大学生告诉我：没有一本文学作品，没有一部电影，是青年们不看，不严格讨论和提出意见的。青年的意见，常常是最尖锐的批评，正因为如此，很受作家重视。因此，苏联作家的每一部作品发表之后，都会很快地得到批评。比如，《新世纪》上发表了留布夫·加勃的小说《在聂斯德河的那边》。加勃是莫斯科一个年青的教员，但他非常熟悉聂斯德河那边的生活。他描写了那边苏维埃政权最初几年的情形。不久，就得到从高尔基城寄来的伊利谢夫的批评文章，指出小说的优点，它真实地描写了年青苏维埃的真实事件，人民与旧统治思想的斗争中，如何成长了新的意识，成为苏维埃人。但，同时批评了作家在运用语言上的失败。在苏联红军当中，战士们讨论到某一著作时，常常请这位作家去参加。军队里非常欢喜作家，认为作家是他们的朋友。但，同时，军队中有专门批评文学作品的组织。文学杂志编辑部为了保证作品的正确性，也把表现战争生活的作品，送交参谋总部或者被描写的部队去审查。《文学报》还经常把编辑计划拿到工厂、农庄、学校中去要求群众讨论，补充意见。苏维埃文学艺术不但在其表现斗争现实一点上与人民结合着，而且在批评一点上与人民密切结合着。人民是现实生活的创造者，正以他们的批评保证苏维埃文学艺术的正确和发展。
    目前，苏联文学批评方面展开的主导问题，正如一篇论文的题目：
    “为布尔什维克的党性，为苏维埃文学的高度艺术技巧而斗争！”
    《文学报》是作家协会的机关报，它经常注意理论与批评的领导。为了上面这一主导问题，最近陆续发表了关于艺术语言，苏联诗的形式，小说结构等问题的论文。特别是作家协会文学批评委员会主席加瓦意契卡的《论文学批评诸问题》，评论了半年来各文学杂志上的作品，文中提出如何研究诗歌中的马雅柯夫斯基路线及不仅从内容还要从艺术形式上评价作品等问题。这篇论文引起读者广泛的注意。《文学报》对《十月》《旗》《新世纪》文学杂志，以及各联盟国、各民族的文学刊物，及其所刊载的作品，经常进行评论，鼓励这些杂志有价值的方面，批评其缺点。这种批评，扼要地说，是争取苏联文学作品中高度思想性与高度艺术性的结合，以共产主义道德教育人民，表现苏联人民生活中新的前进的事物，而暴露、批判旧意识的残余。同时，文学杂志也引导着作家为人民斗争服务的道路，比如《文学报》最进准备发表一篇文章，叫作《苏维埃文学艺术在保卫和平中的贡献》。
    现在，让我们再回到作家协会主席团扩大会议上来。
    作为举例，我记录下我听到一位发言人发言的片断。卡拉别尼可夫，——《各民族人民之友谊》编辑人，他批评民族文学委员会的报告：“未指出各民族文学在保卫和平斗争中的重要作用，以及各民族曾经尽了很大努力研究了各民族的文学史；对于乌米特——这个著作甚多的理论家，特别是他关于社会主义现实主义问题的著作，未特别介绍；对于列西连卡《论高尔基与杨卡·库巴拉》一文的缺点没有指出，以帮助这个年青的理论家的进步。”他最后严格地批评报告所以令人不够满意，原因是由于“平时对各民族文学注意研究得不够”，他认为“这种工作作风，应提起民族文学委员会的注意”。我举这个例子，读者自然明白，不是为了说明那种工作上的缺点，而是说明在苏联作家之间，进行着怎样严格、直爽的批评，说明苏联作家之间的原则空气，说明苏联作家的政治质量。
    同时，我们记得，从日丹诺夫关于文学、艺术与哲学诸问题报告以来，苏维埃文学正是以不断揭露、纠正工作中的缺点，而突飞猛进，光辉灿烂起来的。
    在那天会议上，西蒙诺夫坐在我们身旁。当卡拉别尼可夫讲到最后几句话时，西蒙诺夫诚恳地对我们说：“你看！——苏联作家在批评上是这样严格的。”
