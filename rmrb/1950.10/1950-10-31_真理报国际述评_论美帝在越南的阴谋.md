Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 29th: Koriunov, in the Truth Daily's international commentary on the 29th, analyzed in detail the nature of the American imperialists' conspiracy in Asia. He wrote: While interfering in Korea, the American ruling clique has also expanded its aggression in Indochina. While ordering American troops to attack Korea, Truman also ordered the acceleration of so-called "military aid" to French forces in Indochina. However, the French offensive launched in North Vietnam in early October was thwarted. The People's Army of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam annihilated a large number of French troops in the Cao Bang and Lang Son areas of North Vietnam, and liberated large areas of territory there, including up to ten heavily fortified cities and fortresses. According to newspaper reports, French forces have recently been retreating to lines "dangerously close to Hanoi."

Koriunov continued: The victories of the Vietnamese People's Army have alarmed both Paris and Washington. According to American newspapers, the situation in Vietnam was one of the main issues discussed by Truman and MacArthur at their meeting on Wake Island, as well as by French Minister of Defense Moch and Minister of Finance Petsche during their recent talks in Washington. In these negotiations, resolutions were passed to transport large new shipments of American arms to the French and Bao Dai armies in Indochina in the near future, and to provide France with substantial financial "aid."

Koriunov concluded: The conspiracy of American imperialists in Indochina shows that foreign warmongers are plotting new crimes against the people of Asia. The people of the East are responding to these new acts of aggression by American imperialists with an intensified struggle for their freedom and independence and for peace.

    论美帝在越南的阴谋
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十九日讯：科里奥诺夫在真理报二十九日的国际述评中，详细分析美帝国主义者在亚洲的阴谋的性质。他写道：美国统治集团在干涉朝鲜的同时，又扩大了他们在印度支那的侵略。在下令美国军队攻击朝鲜的时候，杜鲁门又下令加速给在印度支那的法军以所谓的“军事援助”。但是，法军于十月初在北越发动的攻势被挫败了。越南民主共和国人民军在北越的高平与谅山地区歼灭了大批法军，并在那里解放了大片领土，包括多至十个防御坚固的城市与要塞。据报纸消息说：最近法军已在向“距河内近得很危险的”阵线撤退。科里奥诺夫继续说：越南人民军的胜利已使巴黎及华盛顿方面感到惊慌。据美国报纸说：越南形势是杜鲁门与麦克阿瑟在威克岛上的会谈以及法国国防部长莫克及财政部长比许最近在华盛顿举行的会谈中所讨论的主要问题之一。在这些谈判中，通过了决议：在最近的将来运送新的大批美国军火给印度支那的法国与保大的军队，并给法国以大量财政“援助”。科里奥诺夫结语说：美国帝国主义者在印度支那的阴谋，表明外国战争贩子们正在策划着新的反对亚洲人民的罪行。东方人民正以加紧争取他们的自由与独立和争取和平的斗争，来回答美国帝国主义者的这些新的侵略行为。
