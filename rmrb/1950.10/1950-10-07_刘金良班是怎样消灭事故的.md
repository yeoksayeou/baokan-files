　　How the Liu Jinliang Team Eliminated Accidents
　　Geng Tiehui
　　The Liu Jinliang Team of the Fushun Power Plant won the glorious title of "Banner for Reducing Coal Consumption Rate" in the Red May competition last year. This year, under the policy of ensuring safe power supply and eliminating responsibility accidents, not only did the entire team ensure seven months without accidents, but it also motivated the Wang Tingming Team to achieve zero accidents in July.

　　The Liu Jinliang Team has a total of 30 workers, including two with relatively good technical skills, 27 with less than five years of work experience, and one probationary technician. Because Liu Jinliang is able to implement scientific division of labor based on the different skills of each person and implement the dedicated responsibility system, the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers are brought into play. At the same time, the awareness is improved, the sense of responsibility is strengthened, and the strict implementation of labor discipline and various systems is consolidated through the weapon of criticism and self-criticism.

　　"Walk diligently, observe diligently, and check diligently" is the first characteristic of Liu Jinliang's leadership. After taking over, he began a step-by-step and planned inspection, first inspecting boilers, fans, boiler power bus rooms, and after inspecting the second factory, he inspected the first factory. "Diligent inspection" has become Liu Jinliang's daily work system. Under his promotion and influence, all team members consciously inspect the machines assigned to them four or five times in a shift, and the workers have also become accustomed to inspection. In order to prevent accidents and improve work, under the leadership of Liu Jinliang, a 15-minute production review meeting is held every day after production to review the problems that occurred during the production process. Liu Jinliang first mobilized Party members and activists to conduct self-criticism and boldly give opinions to others, praising the good and criticizing the bad. Therefore, criticism and self-criticism were universally carried out, giving play to the workers' sense of responsibility as masters, which played a very important role in improving technology, improving work, ensuring safe power supply, and eliminating accidents.

　　Consolidating the dedicated responsibility system is the second characteristic of the Liu Jinliang Team in doing a good job in production. In the past, the allocation of personnel was determined by the team leader, which was neither fixed nor did it pay attention to the coordination of skills. Therefore, the phenomenon of mutual shirking of responsibility often occurred, which affected the progress of work and the unity among workers. Based on this phenomenon, Liu Jinliang proposed to study it with everyone and re-divided the work according to the opinions of the masses under the principle of "the good leads the bad," initially improving the phenomenon of no one being responsible. In April, under the instructions of the Northeast Industrial Department, the dedicated responsibility system was further implemented, which provided a strong guarantee for safe power supply and the elimination of responsibility accidents.

　　The Liu Jinliang Team is very serious about implementing the dedicated responsibility system, and they have established a series of work systems: 1. Establish a card system. Before igniting the furnace, the operator responsible for igniting the furnace fills in the various places that need to be checked on the boiler on a card, hands it to the team leader, and the team leader stamps the card after reviewing it, and then hands it to the shift leader. If the shift leader also thinks there is no problem, the operator responsible for ignition will conduct the inspection in the order filled in on the card. This prevents negligence and carelessness in the inspection, and thus prevents accidents. 2. Establish a shift handover system. In the past, there was a lack of unity between shifts, and accidents often occurred during shift handover. Since the establishment of the shift handover system, the person handing over first introduces the operation situation to the person taking over, and clearly explains verbally which components should be paid attention to, and writes important things in the log. If there is a fault, it can be handled clearly after joint research, and the person handing over can go home. 3. Establish a meeting between the furnace foreman of the first and second factories to exchange the operation status of the day and the condition of the boiler, and study how to prevent the occurrence and expansion of accidents, so as to avoid temporary confusion in case of accidents. 4. Establish a team leader reporting system. After a day's work, the team leader reports the boiler operation and personnel situation to the workshop director and technician, so that they can fully grasp the situation and actively plan which furnace should be repaired, which furnace should be stopped, and which furnace should be ignited, so as to prevent the occurrence of accidents.

　　Regularly contacting relevant departments and correctly grasping the overall operation situation is also an important link in preventing accidents. The Liu Jinliang Team has established the following contacts with relevant departments: (1) Contact with the electrical workshop. After starting work, first notify the power distribution workshop of the use of boilers and standby boilers, so that the power distribution workshop knows the output and operation of the boilers. If an accident occurs and the load changes, the power distribution personnel will not prolong the time to deal with the problem because they do not know the boiler operation. (2) Contact between the first and second factories. In the past, when the second factory supplied steam to the first factory, accidents often occurred due to a lack of understanding of the situation. Sometimes the steam pressure was high, sometimes the steam pressure was low, and even excessive water was delivered. Now it has been changed to unified leadership of the first and second factories by the workshop. After taking over the shift, the first and second factories study the situation with each other, and both parties know the used furnace and the standby furnace; if an accident occurs, they prepare in advance which steam valve should be opened. (3) Contact with the fuel section. In the past, there was no contact with the fuel workshop. Sometimes the fuel workshop put a hopper of coal on the boiler that was being overhauled. The coal piled up in the hopper for two or three months, and spontaneous combustion often occurred. After learning from the above lessons, after the boiler team starts work, it immediately notifies the fuel workshop which boilers are in operation, which are on standby, which are being overhauled or repaired, and how much coal should be added to which boiler, so that the fuel section can add coal according to the specific situation. The fuel workshop also often looks at the smoke color in the chimney and tells the boiler team to adjust the firepower, which plays a great role in preventing accidents and reducing coal consumption.

　　Conscientiously implementing labor discipline and striving to learn culture and technology are also important reasons for the Liu Jinliang Team to eliminate accidents. Liu Jinliang implements the new labor discipline seriously and conscientiously. At the summary meeting every day, he gives appropriate criticism or due punishment to those who violate discipline, so now the workers of the team regard labor discipline as an inviolable law.

　　In order to achieve the combination of science and technology, Liu Jinliang led the entire team to study "Operating Procedures" hard and carry out mutual learning among employees. The team studies "Procedure System Education" (mainly including operating procedures, etc.) twice every five days, one hour each time, taught by technicians Xie Tingren and Yu Lipei. After studying, the technical level of the workers has obviously improved. According to the test results, the average score of all 31 members of the team is 70.3, including one person with a score of 90 or above and five people with scores between 80 and 90.

　　刘金良班是怎样消灭事故的
    耿铁惠
    抚顺发电厂刘金良班，在去年红五月竞赛中得到全厂“降低燃煤率的旗帜”的光荣称号；今年在安全供电，消灭责任事故的方针下，不仅保证了全班七个月没出事故，而且带动王廷明班七月份也未出事故。
    刘金良班共有工友三十名，其中技术较好的两名，五年工龄以下的二十七名，见习技术员一名。因为刘金良能根据各人技术的不同实行科学的分工，贯彻了专责制，使工人的积极性和创造性得以发挥；同时并通过批评与自我批评的武器，提高了觉悟，加强了责任感，巩固了劳动纪律和各种制度的严格执行。
    “勤走、勤看、勤检查”是刘金良领导工作的第一个特点。他接班后就开始了有步骤有计划的检查，首先检查锅炉，风扇，锅炉电源母线室，二厂检查完了就到一厂检查，“勤检查”已成为刘金良每天的工作制度。在他的推动和影响下，全班工友对每个人所分担的机器，在一班中都自觉的检查四、五次，工友们对于检查也都成了习惯。为了防止事故改进工作，在刘金良的领导下，每天生产完了，就召开十五分钟的生产检讨会，检讨生产过程中所发生的问题。刘金良首先发动党员和积极分子进行自我检讨，并大胆给别人提意见，好的进行表扬，坏的进行批评。因此批评与自我批评得以普遍展开，发挥了工人主人翁的责任感，这对于改进技术，提高工作，保证安全供电，消灭事故上起了很重要的作用。
    巩固专责制，是刘金良班搞好生产的第二个特点。过去人员的分配是班长说了就算，既不固定，又没有注意到技术的配合，因此经常发生互相推卸不负责任现象，影响了工作的进展和工友间的团结。根据这一现象，刘金良便提出来和大家研究，根据群众意见，在“好的带差的”的原则下重新分工，初步改进了无人负责的现象。四月间，在东北工业部指示下，又进一步执行了专责制，使安全供电，消灭责任事故得到有力保证。
    刘金良班贯彻专责制上非常认真，他们并建立了一系列的工作制度：一、建立卡片制。在点炉前由负责点炉的运转员，把锅炉需要检查的各处填写在卡片上，交给班长，班长审查后就在卡片上盖章，再交给值长看，值长也认为没问题，即由负责点火的运转员，按卡片填写的次序进行检查，这样就防止了检查的疏忽大意，马虎从事，也就防止了事故。二、建立交接班制。过去班与班之间互不团结，往往在交接班当中，发生事故。自从建立起交接班制以后，交班者首先向接班者介绍运转情况，那个机件应该注意的用口头交代清楚，重要的写在日志上，如有故障经双方研究处理清楚，交班者才得回家。三、建立了一厂与二厂的司炉长碰头会，交换当日运转的情况，及锅炉的情形，研究如何预防事故的发生并防止其扩大，免得遇事临时忙乱。四、建立了班长汇报制。一天工作完了后，班长把锅炉运转情况及人员情况，向车间主任及技师汇报，使他们能全面掌握情况，主动计划那个炉该修，那个炉应该停，那个炉应当点火等，可以预防事故的发生。
    经常与各有关部联系，正确掌握全面运转情况，同是防止事故的一个重要环节。刘金良班就与各有关部建立了如下的联系：（一）与电气车间的联系。上班后先把使用锅炉和预备锅炉通知配电车间，使配电车间知道锅炉的出力，和运转情况，如果发生事故负荷变动，配电人员不致因不知锅炉运转情况，而延长处理问题的时间。（二）一厂与二厂的联系。过去二厂给一厂送汽时往往因不了解情况而发生事故。有时汽压高，有时汽压低，甚至还有送水过多的现象。现在改为车间对一厂与二厂的统一领导。在接班后，一厂二厂互相研究情况，双方都知道使用炉，备用炉；如发生事故，应开那个汽门都预先准备好。（三）与燃料间的联系。过去与燃料车间没联系，有时燃料车间把大修的锅炉上了一斗子煤，煤在斗子里堆两三个月，常发生自然发火。接受以上的教训后，锅炉班上班后，即通知燃料车间，那几台炉运转，那几台预备，那几台大修或检修，那个炉该上多少煤等，使燃料间根据具体情况添煤。燃料车间还经常看烟筒里的烟色，告诉锅炉班调整火力，这对于防止事故发生与降低燃煤起很大的作用。
    认真执行劳动纪律与努力学习文化技术，也是刘金良班消灭事故的重要原因之一。刘金良对新的劳动纪律执行严肃而认真。每天在总结会上，对犯纪律的人员严正的予以适当的批评或应得的处分，所以现在该班工友把劳动纪律看成了不可侵犯的法律。
    为达到科学与技术相结合，刘金良领导全班努力学习“运转规程”和展开职工间的互相学习。该班每五天学习两次“规程体制教育”（主要包括运转规程等），每次一小时，由技术员谢廷仁，余立培教授。经过学习，工友们的技术水平显见提高。据测验结果，全班三十一人，平均分数为七十·三，其中九十分以上者一名，八十分以上九十分以下者五名。
