　　罗马尼亚展览会闭幕
    在京展览期间深受观众欢迎
    【新华社十日讯】九月十一日在首都劳动人民文化宫揭幕的“向社会主义迈进的罗马尼亚展览会”，已于十月九日闭幕。展览日期二十九天，每天从上午九时到下午九时，前往参观的群众总计十五万人，包括工人、农民、士兵、教员、学生、店员、各机关工作人员及艺术工作者等。有一位观众在意见簿上写道：“一个民族或一个国家，只有在工人阶级的党领导下，在短短的数年中，才有如此光辉的成就。罗马尼亚就是一个典型的范例。”另一位观众写道：“从万里以外运来这些珍贵的展览品，愈加增强了我们建设新中国的信心，和对于伟大的苏联与罗马尼亚劳动人民的热爱。”这些展览品准备分赴天津、沈阳、上海、南京、汉口等地展出。
