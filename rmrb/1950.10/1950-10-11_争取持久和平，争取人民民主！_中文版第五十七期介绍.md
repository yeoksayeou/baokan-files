　　Xinhua News Agency, October 10th: "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition No. 57 (Total No. 96) has been published.

　　The editorial in this issue is entitled "Evidence of the Soviet Union's Peaceful Policy." The editorial points out: In the days of war hysteria that is shaking the capitalist world, in the days of unprecedented arms races and atomic blackmail, the Soviet Council of Ministers has made historically significant decisions "on the construction of the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station on the Volga River," "on the construction of the Stalingrad Hydropower Station on the Volga River," and "on the irrigation of areas along the Caspian Sea." These greatest constructions of modern times are new evidence of the Soviet Union's thorough and firm peaceful policy. The editorial states: The Soviet government has decided to build the world's largest hydroelectric power stations on the Volga River: the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station (with a power generation capacity of 2 million kilowatts) and the Stalingrad Hydropower Station (with a power generation capacity of 1.7 million kilowatts), which can generate nearly 20 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. In addition to supplying electricity to Moscow, Kuibyshev, Saratov and other regions, these two hydropower stations will also supply electricity to the states in the Central Black Earth Region, the Stalingrad, Saratov and Astrakhan states, to irrigate the land in the Volga River basin and along the Caspian Sea. The editorial points out: These unprecedentedly large-scale constructions—the true construction of communism—will transform the natural conditions of the vast areas along the Caspian Sea and the Volga River basin, turning vast deserts and semi-desert arid grasslands into fertile fields, and enabling them to be fully used by mankind. The editorial states: The decision for this great task is only possible in a society that has broken free from capitalist enslavement, where the most important law of development is the continuous improvement of the welfare of the working people; this is in stark contrast to the law of the capitalist world where man eats man, where a small handful of monopoly capitalists get rich by constantly impoverishing the masses of the people, and from their blood and tears. The editorial continues: Just as "l'Humanité" said, "These constructions demonstrate clear and decisive evidence that socialism is the continuous development of productive forces, and this is peace." The Soviet people, who are actively participating in creative reforms in their own country, are deeply concerned about stable and lasting peace in order to realize their plans for further prosperity of the motherland. They do not need war. They are convinced that socialism will defeat capitalism in the peaceful competition between the two systems, and that in our era all roads lead to communism. This is why all working people, all friends of the Soviet Union in all countries, welcome the decision on these great constructions with the greatest interest, joy and pride. The editorial then contrasts the US imperialism's pushing the world towards a new war with its mad arms race; while the Soviet Union is using its massive construction work to consolidate the cause of world peace. The editorial points out: The stronger the Soviet socialist economy becomes, and the stronger the economies of China, the people's democracies and the German Democratic Republic become, the more consolidated world peace will be.

　　Another editorial in this issue is entitled "Fascist Terror Will Not Thwart the Will of the People of All Countries to Fight for Peace." The editorial points out: International imperialist reactionaries are now adopting political assassinations and terrorism as a means to realize their aggressive conspiracies. The editorial says: The imperialist reactionaries are first of all striking at the main representatives of the working class, because they know that the working class and its party are the main forces hindering the war-mongers' path and shattering their conspiracies. The bourgeois states today are mobilizing the entire police-administrative machine to deal with the Communist Party and other democratic organizations. Police searches of the Communist Party and other democratic organizations' locations, bans on Communist Party activities, closures of progressive newspapers, and arrests and accusations of peace advocates are happening one after another. The editorial points out: This violent anti-communist persecution, which has been carried out with redoubled force in capitalist countries in the years since the war, is directed by a single center. Its instigators and organizers are the ruling classes of the United States of America and the capitalist countries affiliated with it. The editorial points out, after listing various facts since the appearance of the so-called "X Plan" of the United States in March 1948, that the international reactionaries intend to use terror to stifle the democratic movement of the masses of people who are fighting against the danger of a new war. All progressive forces concerned with maintaining peace, democracy and freedom must resolutely resist the tactics of terror and political assassination adopted by the imperialist ruling groups. The editorial reminds us that it would be a serious mistake to think that the reactionaries' terrorist actions only involve the Communist Party. Historical experience irrefutably proves that the crusade against the Communist Party means an attack on democratic and progressive forces, and threatens all of them to the same extent. The editorial says: Historical experience shows that classes doomed to perish inevitably resort to terror. Comrade Stalin said: "There has never been a case in history where a dying bourgeoisie does not exert its remaining strength to maintain its existence." In the struggle against this weapon of the reactionaries, the working class has reliable methods, which are organization, unremitting revolutionary vigilance, and constant concern for their leaders, who spare no effort and life to defend the interests of the working class and the interests of the people. The editorial concludes: The malicious tactics of assassination and provocation are bound to fail. Heinous atrocities did not help Mussolini and Hitler, nor will they help the conspirators who are today against the leaders of the working-class movement. The Communist Parties of all countries are now stronger than before. Their influence among the masses is growing. They enjoy the increasing sympathy and support of the broad masses of the people. There is no doubt that the masses will support the efforts of all democratic groups to crush the evil terrorist plans against the leading representatives of the working class.

　　This issue also includes "The Czechoslovak Trade Union is Fighting to Complete the Second Year Plan of the Five-Year Plan" written by Čupek, Chairman of the Czechoslovak United Trade Union, and "The Working People of London Defend Peace" written by Mahon, a member of the Political Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain, "The Chilean People Resist Wall Street's War Policy" and other papers written by Luis Carlos Prestes, General Secretary of the Chilean Communist Party.

　　“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    中文版第五十七期介绍
    【新华社十日讯】“争取持久和平，争取人民民主!”中文版第五十七期（总第九十六期）已经出版。
    该刊本期社论题为“苏联和平政策的明证”。社论指出：在震撼资本主义世界的战争歇斯底里，在空前的军备竞赛和原子敲诈的时日里，苏联部长会议却作了“关于在伏尔加河上建设古比雪夫水电站”、“关于在伏尔加河上建设斯大林格勒水电站”和“关于里海沿岸各区的灌溉”的有历史意义的决定。这些现代最伟大的建设乃是苏联彻底和坚定的和平政策的新的明证。社论称：苏联政府决定在伏尔加河上建设世界最大的水力发电站：古比雪夫水电站（发电量二百万基罗瓦特）和斯大林格勒水电站（发电量一百七十万基罗瓦特），每年能发将近二百亿基罗瓦特时的电力。这两所水电站除供给莫斯科、古比雪夫、萨拉托夫等区以电力外，还供给电力给中央黑土地带各州、斯大林格勒、萨拉托夫和阿斯特拉罕各州，以灌溉伏尔加流域和里海沿岸的土地。社论指出：这些空前巨大规模的建设——共产主义的真正建设——将要改造里海沿岸和伏尔加河流域的广大地区的自然条件，使巨大的沙漠和半沙漠的干旱草原变成为肥沃的良田，并使它们能完全供人类使用。社论称：这种伟大任务的决定只有在摆脱了资本主义奴役的社会里才有可能，这个社会的最重要的发展规律，是不断地提高劳动人民的福利；这与资本主义世界人吃人的规律恰恰相反，在资本主义世界，一小撮的独占资本家借着人民大众的不断贫困，以及他们的血和泪而使自己发财致富。社论继称：正象“人道报”所说，“这些建设表现出明确的、有决定性的证据，即社会主义就是生产力的不断发展，这就是和平”。积极参加在本国进行创造性改革的苏联人民，为了实现其进一步繁荣祖国的计划，而深切地关怀着稳定和持久的和平。他们不需要战争。他们深信，社会主义将要在两种制度的和平竞赛中战胜资本主义，在我们时代条条道路通向共产主义。这就是为什么全体劳动人民，一切国家的全体苏联之友要以最大的兴趣、喜悦和骄傲来欢迎关于这些伟大建设的决定。社论接着对比了美帝国主义用疯狂的军备竞赛把世界推向新的战争；而苏联却用其巨大的建设工作来巩固全世界的和平事业。社论指出：苏联社会主义的经济越益强盛，以及中国、人民民主各国和德国民主共和国的经济越益强盛，全世界的和平就越益巩固。
    该刊本期的另一篇社论题为“法西斯恐怖将不能挫折各国人民为争取和平而斗争的意志”。社论指出：国际帝国主义反动派现在正采取政治暗杀及恐怖的方法作为实现其侵略阴谋的手段。社论说：帝国主义反动派首先是打击工人阶级的主要代表们，因为它知道工人阶级和它的党是阻碍战争贩子的道路及粉碎其阴谋的主要力量。资产阶级国家今天正动员全套的警察——行政机器来对付共产党及其他民主组织。警察搜查共产党及其他民主组织所在地，禁止共产党活动，封闭进步报纸，以及逮捕和控告和平拥护者的事情层出不穷。社论指出：战后几年在资本主义国家以加倍力量进行的这种狂暴的反共迫害，是由单一的中心指挥的。它的鼓动者及组织者是美利坚合众国和附属于它的资本主义国家的统治阶级。社论在历举自一九四八年三月美国的所谓“Ｘ计划”出现以来的种种事实之后指出：国际反动派打算用恐怖的方法扼杀正在为反对新战争危险而斗争的人民大众的民主运动。一切关心维持和平与民主自由的进步力量必须坚决地抗拒帝国主义统治集团采用恐怖与政治暗杀的策略。社论提醒说：如果认为反动派的恐怖行动仅仅涉及共产党，那是严重的错误。历史的经验无可辩驳地证明：反对共产党的十字军就是意味着对民主进步力量的进攻，并且也以同等程度威胁着它们全体。社论说：历史经验显示：命定要灭亡的阶级必然借助于恐怖。斯大林同志说：“垂死的资产阶级不施出它剩余的力量来保持它的存在，这种情形在历史上是没有的。”在对付反动派这种武器的斗争中，工人阶级拥有可靠的方法，这方法就是组织，毫不松弛的革命警觉性，时刻地关心他们的领袖，这些领袖不吝惜精力和生命来保卫工人阶级的利益和人民的利益。社论结语称：暗杀与挑衅的恶毒策略必遭失败。可恶的暴行并无助于墨索里尼与希特勒，它们也将无助于今天反对工人阶级运动领导人的阴谋组织者。各国共产党今天已比以前更加强大。它们在群众中的影响日益增长。它们享有广大人民的日益增加的同情与支持。无论如何没有疑问，群众将支持所有民主团体的努力，来粉碎对付工人阶级领导代表的罪恶的恐怖计划。
    该刊本期还刊登了捷克斯洛伐克统一工会主席初卜卡写的“捷克斯洛伐克工会为完成五年计划的第二年计划而斗争”及英共政治委员会委员马洪写的“伦敦的劳动人民保卫和平”、智利共产党总书记第亚士写的“智利人民抵抗华尔街的战争政策”等论文。
