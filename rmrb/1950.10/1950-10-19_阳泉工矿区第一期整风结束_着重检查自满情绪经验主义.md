(Our Yangquan Dispatch) The first phase of the rectification campaign in factories and mines of the Yangquan Industrial and Mining Area, Shanxi Province, which began on August 15th and lasted 45 days, concluded on September 30th.

Yangquan was liberated relatively early, and the recovery of industrial and mining production was relatively fast. As a result, the leaders of the Yangquan Industrial and Mining Area Party Committee developed a blind sense of complacency, and in their leadership methods, continued to adhere to the old ways of empiricism.

In this rectification campaign, the focus was on examining the thought and work style of mine and factory leaders who failed to rely on workers to manage enterprises and lacked a mass viewpoint, specifically manifested in:

First, the factory management committees and worker representative assemblies generally became mere formalities. Factory affairs meetings and general branch committees often replaced the management committees. Most workers did not know who the members of the management committee were. Some responsible cadres in coal mines mistakenly believed that production could not proceed without the headmen. Some factories and mines suffered continuous losses in production because they did not adopt rationalization proposals put forward by workers.

Second, leading cadres were busy with administrative affairs, working in a handicraft manner, and did not know how to utilize organizational strength. The deputy director of the egg factory personally registered and stored each piece of wood used for repairing houses, leaving the warehouse keeper idle. However, the factory director put major production issues out of his mind. Due to poor planning at the start of operations, delays occurred repeatedly, resulting in a loss of over 1,500 pounds of finished product from two million eggs, costing over 20 million yuan. The director of the No. 4 Coal Mine had to personally approve and review slips from all 19 departments under his jurisdiction, even approving a worker's family borrowing a bucket of water, and calling to say, "Return it on time, don't break it." The mine experienced frequent injury and death accidents during production, but the director rarely considered them. When recruiting workers, they were allowed to work underground without examination or training. The Coal Mine Management Bureau stipulates that new workers must be trained for five days in advance, with experienced workers providing on-site guidance for a week, and they cannot work independently in the short term. This regulation has not been implemented in the Yangquan mine to this day. As a result, from January to June, 11 workers died, including two deaf people, one mute, and three inexperienced new workers.

Third, they did not know how to follow the mass line in their work. Systems and labor discipline were subjectively drafted by a few leaders, and executed by issuing orders, with very poor results. When establishing the responsibility system in the power plant, it was not discussed by the masses. Employees did not understand the meaning of the level-by-level responsibility system, and they were all afraid of writing self-criticisms and being punished if an accident occurred, forming a situation of pushing responsibility level by level. Once a problem occurred, workers reported to the group leader, the group leader reported to the section chief, and the section chief reported to the factory director, often failing to seize the time to deal with preventable accidents. In the past year, accidents occurred frequently in the power plant, greatly affecting coal mine production. Similar situations existed in other mines, making the responsibility system nominal.

Fourth, the viewpoint of relying on all employees to improve production was not clear, especially the importance of uniting technical personnel was not emphasized. Some veteran cadres considered themselves meritorious and became arrogant and complacent. They looked down on new cadres and were dissatisfied with the high salaries of technical personnel, creating a ideological divide between themselves and technical personnel. Some responsible comrades did not understand production themselves, but insisted on pretending to understand, and were not willing to learn from others humbly. Another tendency was to accommodate technical personnel in everything without providing education and assistance, thus preventing some technical personnel from shedding the erroneous view of being arrogant and looking down on workers that they had cultivated in bureaucratic capitalist enterprises for a long time.

Fifth, in Party work, to ensure and supervise the completion of production tasks, they often only made general appeals, rarely delving into workshop branches or groups to provide specific assistance and carry out propaganda and mobilization work. They did not vigorously educate Party members to become model members of the trade union, so as to consolidate the Party's leadership over the trade union and do a good job of mass work through the trade union. On the other hand, they often took over administrative work. When the Party branch of the egg factory made decisions on wage evaluations, it also had to manage matters such as repairing houses and installing glass.

Sixth, trade union workers lacked a clear stance. After emphasizing the establishment of a production viewpoint and making some achievements in production, they forgot that they should represent the interests of all workers and supervise and change some erroneous measures that excessively harmed workers' health and violated their interests. Workers in the cast iron pipe workshop of the state-owned Yangquan Iron Factory worked overtime for four hours every day (nine hours per shift), and worked overtime about 20 times a month. The egg factory unreasonably dismissed a female worker. The trade union either did not raise any objections to these incidents, or failed to resolve them after raising them, but did not persist. As a result, workers felt that "the trade union is exactly the same as the administration, speaking with one voice," which increased the difficulty of the trade union in contacting the masses and was not conducive to improving production.

In this rectification campaign, the Yangquan Industrial and Mining Area not only examined the main shortcomings in its work, but also summarized the successful experiences in its work. The Yangquan Mining Bureau and its subordinate mines grasped the important link in coal mine production—the issue of safety in production—and focused on examining and summarizing the security work in the third quarter. Since the bureau launched the security campaign in July, worker injuries and deaths have decreased month by month. The total number of injuries and deaths in the third quarter of the bureau's subordinate mines was 81 (3 deaths), a decrease of 542 compared to the second quarter's 623 (3 deaths)—that is, a decrease of 87 percent. The basic reason for the reduction in injuries and deaths was the full mobilization of the masses and the launching of a mass security campaign. Doing a good job of security work began to become a conscious action for all workers. Individuals and groups all formulated security plans and challenged each other; mass supervision was implemented. It was impossible to prevent smoking underground in the past, but now it has been achieved. This made all cadres more clearly aware of the importance of following the mass line in their thinking.

### 阳泉工矿区第一期整风结束  着重检查自满情绪经验主义

　　阳泉工矿区第一期整风结束
    着重检查自满情绪经验主义
    【本报阳泉讯】山西省阳泉工矿区工厂、矿山的第一期整风，自八月十五日开始，历时四十五天，已于九月三十日结束。
    阳泉解放较早，工矿生产恢复较快。阳泉工矿区委领导上因此产生了盲目自满情绪，在领导方法上，继续保守着经验主义老一套的作风。
    在这次整风中，着重检讨了矿、厂领导上不依靠工人管理企业，缺乏群众观点的思想和作风，具体表现在：
    第一，工厂管理委员会、职工代表会普遍流于形式，厂务会议、总支委员会常常代替了管委会，大部分职工不知道管委会委员是谁。煤矿中的若干负责干部，曾错误地认为离开把头，生产就无法进行。有的厂、矿因不采纳工人提出的合理化建议，在生产上不断遭受损失。
    第二，领导干部自己忙于事务，用手工业的方式进行工作，不会运用组织力量。蛋厂的副厂长自己一根根登记存放修房用的木料，使保管员歇着没事干。生产上的重大问题，厂长却置诸脑后。开工时因计划不周，一再迟延，使二百万个蛋少出一千五百多磅成品，损失两千多万元。煤矿四矿矿长对所属十九个部门的条子都要亲自批看，甚至工人家属借一担水桶也要自己批准，并打电话告说：“按时送回，不要坏了。”该矿生产中屡出伤亡事故，矿长却很少考虑。招收工人时不经检定和训练，即让下井工作。煤矿管理总局规定新工人须预先训练五天，并有熟练工人实地指导工作一星期，且短期内不能单独工作。这一规定，阳泉矿至今未执行。因此，一月至六月死亡工人十一名，其中有两个聋子一个哑子，三个经验少的新工人。
    第三，工作中不会走群众路线。制度和劳动纪律是领导上几个人主观拟就的，下命令执行，效果很坏。发电厂建立责任制时，未通过群众讨论，职工不了解逐级负责制的意义，全怕出了事故写悔过书，受处罚，形成逐级推责任。一发生问题，工人报告组长，组长报告股长，股长报告厂长，常常不能争取时间处理可以避免的事故。过去一年内发电厂事故丛生，影响煤矿生产甚巨。其他矿也有类似情形，使责任制有名无实。
    第四，对依靠全体职工搞好生产的观点不明确，尤其没有注意团结技术人员。某些老干部功臣自居，骄傲自满，看不起新干部，不满技术人员工资高，在思想上与技术人员划了一条鸿沟。有的负责同志自己不懂生产，却硬要装懂，不虚心向别人学习。另一种是对技术人员事事迁就，不进行教育帮助，因而使部分技术人员不能去掉长期在官僚资本企业中养成的自高自大，看不起工人的错误观点。
    第五，在党的工作上，对保证与监督生产任务的完成，往往只作一般号召，很少深入车间支部或小组，作具体的帮助和进行宣传鼓动工作，没有大力教育党员成为工会的模范会员，以巩固党对工会的领导，和通过工会做好群众工作。另一方面，却又常常包办行政工作，蛋厂评资时，党支部作决定，修房按装玻璃的事，支部也要去管。
    第六，工会工作者立场不明确，强调树立生产观点后，在生产上做出了一些成绩，但又忘记了应该代表全体职工群众的利益，监督改变某些过份伤害工人健康，违背工人利益的错误措施。国营阳泉铁厂铸管场工人每天加班四小时（本班九小时），一个月中加班达二十次左右；蛋厂曾无理开除一女工。工会对这些事件，或未提出意见，或提出意见后未得解决，但也没有坚持。这样，就使工人产生了所谓“工会和行政一模一样，一个鼻孔出气。”的感觉。增加了工会联系群众的困难，对搞好生产是不利的。
    阳泉工矿区在这次整风中，不仅检查出工作中的主要缺点，同时也总结出工作中的成功经验。阳泉矿务局及其所属各矿抓住了煤矿生产中的重要环节——生产中的安全问题，着重检查和总结第三季保安工作，该矿务局自七月开展保安运动以来，工人伤亡逐月减少。该局所属各矿第三季伤亡总数八十一人（亡三人），比第二季六二三人（亡三人）减少五四二人——即减少百分之八十七。伤亡减少的基本原因是充分地发动了群众，开展了群众性的保安运动。做好保安工作，开始成为全体工人自觉的行动。个人和小组都订定了保安计划，相互挑战；实行了群众性的监督。过去不可能做到井下不吸烟，现在也做到了。这使全体干部在思想上更加明确地认识了走群众路线的重要意义。
