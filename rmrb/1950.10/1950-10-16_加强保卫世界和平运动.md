　　To resist American imperialism's aggression, the best method is to unite all possible peace and democratic forces, allowing them to develop even further, and to raise the level of awareness of the majority of people worldwide. The world peace movement and organization are constantly expanding. By August 15th, over 280 million people worldwide had signed the peace declaration, with the largest number of signatures coming from the Soviet Union, totaling 115,270,000. These 280 million plus signatories are good people from over seventy countries with different systems.

　　China's working class is carrying out active struggles across the country to defend world peace. In railways, factories, and mines throughout the country, the peace signature campaign has entered a fervent climax. In addition to eagerly signing themselves and mobilizing their families to enthusiastically sign, workers are expressing their firm will and strength to defend world peace through practical actions of intensifying production. In many regions, workers are also adding their fingerprints after signing to show the solemnity and seriousness of their determination to defend peace.

　　This November, the Second World Peace Congress will be held. Undoubtedly, in these times of burning warfare, this meeting is very important. It will summarize the practical work of peace fighters from various countries and review the strength and determination of each country's organization for defending peace. It will closely unite the strength and determination of people worldwide to defend peace, effectively curbing the crisis of war.

　　I think this way: if the people of the entire Earth all say "No to war," then the imperialists must carefully consider things before they throw themselves into the furnace of world war. I think that if the imperialists unleash a third world war, then this war will become the grave of world capitalism. We have all signed the appeal, opposing the proponents of atomic weapons. This is an exceptionally important matter. The voice of the people is a great thing. Let the American imperialists remember this! Anything the people do not want will never succeed.

　　The cause of peace cannot wait. It requires not only good intentions but also practical actions. To stop the bloody hands of the war-mongers in Washington and London, this is the combat mission of the workers of the world.

　　We have the right to warn the imperialist warmongers to quickly clear their heads and to understand that people who have already gained independence and freedom are absolutely unwilling to have the shackles of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism placed on them again. We are working hard to build our new, democratic, free, and happy China, laying a solid foundation for a beautiful life for our children and grandchildren, and we will never allow American imperialism to operate on the Chinese mainland again.

　　We call on people of all races, nationalities, political opinions, and religious beliefs to participate in this signature campaign, uniting hundreds of millions of men, women, and youth around the world to sign this appeal. Know that the collection of hundreds of millions of signatures is enough to prove that the masses of people declare the use of atomic weapons illegal, and every signature can deliver a blow to the warmongers.

　　加强保卫世界和平运动
    马寅初
    欲抵抗美帝的侵略，最好的方法，是团结一切可能的和平民主力量使之获得更大的发展，把全世界大多数人民的觉悟程度提高。世界和平运动与组织，正在不断的扩大。至八月十五日全世界已有两亿八千多万人，在和平宣言上签了名，其中以苏联人民签名的最多，共计一亿一千五百二十七万。这两亿八千多万的签名者，是七十个以上不同制度的国家中善良的人民。
    中国工人阶级为了保卫世界和平，正在全国各地进行着积极的斗争。在全国各铁路、各工厂、各矿山，和平签名运动已经进入热烈的高潮。职工们除了自己争先签名和发动家属踊跃签名，并纷纷以加紧生产的实际行动来表示他们对保卫世界和平的坚决意志与力量。许多地区的职工并在签名后按上指印，以表示他们保卫和平决心的郑重和庄严。
    今年十一月，第二次世界保卫和平大会即将召开。无疑的这个会议，在战火燃烧着的今天，是非常重要的。它将总结各国和平斗士们的实际工作，并检阅各国为保卫和平所组织的力量和决心。使全世界人民保卫和平的力量和决心，紧密地团结在一起，有力地制止战争的危机。
    我这样想：如果全地球上的人民都说“不要战争”，那么帝国主义者们在他们投入世界战争的熔炉之前，就必须好好地考虑一下了。我是这样想的，如果帝国主义者们掀起了第三次世界大战，那么这次战争，就会成为世界资本主义的坟墓。我们都在呼吁书上签了名，反对原子武器论者。这是一件异常重要的事情。人民的呼声，是伟大的事情。让美帝国主义者们牢记吧！凡是人民所不愿意的事，永远不会成功的。
    和平事业是不能等待的。它所要求的不仅是要善良的意图。还要有实际的行动。要制止华盛顿和伦敦的战争贩子们的血腥的手，这是全世界劳动者们的战斗任务。
    我们有权警告帝国主义好战分子应该快快把头脑弄得清醒点，要晓得凡已经得到独立自由的人民，决不愿再在他们的身上加上半封建半殖民地的锁链。我们正在努力建设我们民主自由幸福的新中国，为我们的子孙后代奠立美满的生活基础，决不肯再让美帝在中国大陆上活动。
    我们要求各种不同种族，不同国籍，不同政治、意见，不同宗教信仰的人民参加这个签名运动，团结全世界亿万的男子、妇女与青年在这个呼吁书上签名。要知道亿万签名的征集，足以证明人民大众宣布使用原子武器是违法的，每一个签名都能给战争贩子们一个打击。
