A Few Party Cadres Have Bully Tendencies; All Localities Should Vigorously Expose and Punish During Rectification

[From Our Newspaper] Combined reports from various locations: Before this rectification and during this rectification, in some places, a very small number of Party members and cadres have displayed a bully style that completely violates the interests of the masses. For example, Gao Yuwu, the Special Service Company Commander of the Hengshui Military Subdistrict in Hebei, once found that the vegetables grown by the company had been stolen. Without asking questions, Gao Yuwu immediately sent soldiers to find Jiao Guochen, the director of the North Gate Farmers' Association, and bring him to the company headquarters. Gao Yuwu started by saying, "We fathers helped you win the world, and now you've forgotten!" Then, he placed Jiao Guochen under house arrest. Some Party cadres, together with retained personnel, relied on their "authority" and used base and shameless means to force marriages, seize brides, and occupy and plunder the property of the masses. For example, in Yanzhuang Village, Fourth District, En County, Hebei, cadres forced 26 middle-peasant households to hand over more than 140 mu of land, of which 70 percent of the best land was divided among them. Liu Zixin, the Secretary of the Fourth District Committee of Shou Zhang County, Pingyuan Province, once forced a 19-year-old girl to marry him. When the woman disagreed, he even went to her home with a gun to threaten and scare her, forcibly marrying the woman. Liu Guoyi, a section member of the Public Security Bureau of Hejian County, Hebei Province, in order to force Li Xiuying, a woman from Longhua Store, to marry him, even set up a private court and tortured Li Xiuying's mother. The masses in these places are extremely dissatisfied with this bully style, saying, "The people's big sky hasn't changed, but our little sky has changed."

The Party and the People's Government have always paid attention to correcting and stopping this bully style and illegal behavior. For those who violate laws and discipline, Party discipline and legal sanctions are imposed. For example, the Pingyuan and Hebei Provincial Party Committees promptly handled the cases of Liu Zixin and Liu Guoyi forcing marriages illegally, expelled them from the Party, and handed over the criminal aspects of their mistakes to the People's Court for handling. However, in order to thoroughly eliminate the bully style, all localities should continue to vigorously expose and punish this bully behavior in this rectification movement.

### 少数党员干部有恶霸作风  各地在整风中应严厉揭发处治

　　少数党员干部有恶霸作风
    各地在整风中应严厉揭发处治
    【本报讯】综合各地报道：在这次整风以前及这次整风中，在某些地方曾发现有极少数党员、干部表现了一种完全违反群众利益的恶霸作风。如河北衡水军分区特务连长杲玉武有一次因该连种的菜蔬被人偷了，杲玉武不问青红皂白，立即派战士将北关农会主任焦国臣找到连部，杲玉武开口就说：“这爹们给你们打下天下，你们这时就忘啦！”说着，竟把焦国臣软禁起来。有些党员干部与留用人员一道，凭借自己的“职权”，利用卑鄙无耻的手段，逼婚，抢亲，霸占与侵夺群众的财产。如河北恩县四区阎庄村干部强迫二十六户中农，拿出一百四十多亩土地，其中百分之七十的好地，都被他们瓜分了。平原省寿张县四区分委书记刘子新，曾经逼迫一个十九岁的姑娘和他结婚，女方不同意，他竟持枪到女家威胁吓唬，强娶了这个妇女。河北省河间县公安局股员刘国义，为逼迫龙花店妇女李秀英和他结婚，竟私立公堂，拷打李秀英的母亲。这些地方的群众对于这种恶霸作风极端不满，说：“人民的大天虽没有变，我们这里的小天却已经变了。”
    党和人民政府对于这种恶霸作风和不法行为，一贯是注意纠正和制止的。对于违犯法纪的分子，并给以党纪与法律的制裁。如中共平原、河北省委对于刘子新、刘国义违法逼婚案件，及时处理，开除了两人的党籍，其属于刑事部分的错误，则送交人民法院处理。但为了彻底肃清恶霸作风，各地还应继续在这次整风运动中严厉揭发与处治这种恶霸行为。
