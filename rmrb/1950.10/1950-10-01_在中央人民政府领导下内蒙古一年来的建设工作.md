　　The Construction Work of Inner Mongolia in the Past Year Under the Leadership of the Central People's Government
　　Ulanhu
　　The great anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is here, and we wholeheartedly and warmly celebrate the national day of our common motherland for all nationalities.
　　Due to the establishment of the new China, the domestic ethnic relations have undergone fundamental changes, and all ethnic groups are building a cooperative and loving family of nationalities in accordance with the ethnic policies in the Common Program.
　　On the occasion of celebrating the National Day, it is necessary to review the work of our Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the past year in order to continue to move forward.
　　In the past year, under the leadership and assistance of the Central People's Government, and with the efforts of party, government, and military cadres at all levels in Inner Mongolia, we have implemented the various policies of the Central People's Government. First, we have resolutely implemented the production policy focusing on the development of agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, and cooperative societies, and have achieved great results.
　　In agricultural production this year, except for a very small portion of cultivated land, more than 14 million mu of cultivated land from last year has been sown, and another 598,580 mu has been reclaimed, completing 101.9 percent of the original plan, expanding the cultivated area by more than 400,000 mu. The three leagues of Hulunbuir, Hinggan, and Jirem expanded paddy fields by 224,820 mu, completing 97.4 percent of the original plan. In the four leagues of Hulunbuir, Hinggan, Jirem, and Ju Ud, the area fertilized accounted for 32.51 percent of the total sown area, an increase of one-half compared to the 3,227,180 mu last year. This is indeed a significant progress in Inner Mongolia, which has a vast territory and sparse population and relatively backward farming techniques.
　　In order to complete the task of increasing production and giving full play to labor efficiency, we guided farmers to gradually organize various forms of mutual labor assistance and production cooperation in accordance with the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. During spring plowing and summer hoeing, we organized the masses to fight against various disasters such as wind, insects, frost, snow, freezing, and hail, and replanted more than 150,000 mu of disaster-stricken land. In particular, we carried out intensive work on repairing dikes and building dams to rescue and prevent floods. In Jirem League, more than 4 million workdays were spent on repairing dikes in the spring, and the banks of the West Liao River were strictly guarded against flooding in the summer, saving more than one million mu of fertile land from floods in Tongliao, Kailu, and East Horqin Banner, resulting in a bumper harvest. After the above efforts, except for some areas in Hinggan League and Hulunbuir League which suffered reduced harvests due to drought, and the more common autumn drought and frost disasters in Jirem and Ju Ud leagues, the general harvest was moderate, but still maintained the production level of 1.1 million tons last year.
　　In our development of production, animal husbandry is second only to agriculture. About three-fifths of the area of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is pastoral area, and 9 percent of the population is engaged in animal husbandry. In pastoral areas, we have resolutely implemented the policy of restoring and developing animal husbandry, protecting young animals and rationally managing herds, implementing freedom of grazing, and adopting policies to reward livestock breeding and a light tax policy of 1 percent. According to the statistics of existing materials, the goals of "stopping the decline and striving for rise" in the three leagues of Xilingol, Chahar, and Jirem and the goal of a net increase of 15 percent in the four leagues of Hulunbuir, Nornhoth, Hinggan, and Ju Ud have been achieved this year. In order to ensure the increase in livestock: ① A large-scale wolf hunting campaign was launched. According to the existing statistics from the four leagues of Hulunbuir, Nornhoth, Jirem, and Xilingol, and Chahar, more than 8,100 wolves have been killed, reaching two-thirds of the annual wolf hunting task of 12,000 in Inner Mongolia; ② Great efforts were made to train livestock epidemic prevention personnel and carry out livestock epidemic prevention work. According to incomplete materials, more than 1.483 million heads of cattle have been inoculated with rabbit-adapted virus vaccine and anthrax vaccine (currently still in progress); ③ Seed livestock were adjusted to prevent mismating of female animals; ④ Livestock pens were repaired, wells were dug, grass was stored, and pastures were adjusted and protected; ⑤ Labor models were rewarded, and production education was carried out through "Nadam" conferences and "Sacrificing to the Aobao" gatherings; ⑥ Ideological education of cadres was strengthened, and the erroneous views of "emphasizing agriculture over animal husbandry" and "animal husbandry has no future" among cadres were corrected.
　　This year's forestry logging task is 400,000 cubic meters, and the planned task has now been completed. There has been progress in forestry management and forest protection compared to last year, mainly reflected in relying on workers, strengthening democratic management of production, and starting to implement rational logging, reducing stump height, utilizing branch wood, and retaining mother trees. In the future, we will strengthen fire prevention, strengthen forestry organizations, focus on forest protection, and carry out planned afforestation and rational management to overcome waste.
　　In terms of industrial and commercial cooperatives, we only had 441 cooperatives of various types last year, with a capital of 49 billion Mongolian currency and 180,000 members. This year, it has developed to 809 cooperatives of various types, with a capital of 190 billion Mongolian currency and 440,000 members. These cooperatives have close ties with state-owned trading agencies and have played a considerable role in helping production and reducing intermediate exploitation.
　　Private industrial and commercial enterprises in Inner Mongolia have also developed: Taking Hailar City as an example, there are 422 industrial and handicraft enterprises this year, compared to only 143 in 1946; the number of employees has increased from 426 in 1946 to 1,384 this year; the capital has increased from 1.8852 million Mongolian currency to 21.16864 million Mongolian currency this year. In terms of commerce, there were 137 enterprises with 514 employees and a capital of 1.325 million Mongolian currency in April 1946, which increased to 372 enterprises with 1,069 employees and a capital of 19.515 million Mongolian currency in March 1950.
　　In terms of cultural and educational work, there are currently 2,874 primary schools with 238,970 students, and the enrollment rate of children of school age is 61 percent. The number of children enrolled this year has increased by more than a quarter compared to last year. Last winter and this spring, 2,671 winter schools were organized in the four eastern leagues, with more than 306,000 students. In the past nine months, 1.2 million copies of Mongolian and Chinese textbooks and 420,000 copies of Mongolian and Chinese popular publications (the largest proportion of which are cultural textbooks and popular reading materials) have been sold in the four eastern leagues, and more than 12,000 copies of various Mongolian and Chinese magazines have been sold. According to statistics in August, a total of more than 14,000 copies of various newspapers were sold. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region currently publishes 11 kinds of Mongolian and Chinese newspapers, pictorials, and magazines. Other social education and cultural activities are gradually being carried out, and broadcasting is beginning to be established.
　　In terms of health work, efforts to prevent and control plague have continued this year. As of August, 7.38 million rats have been caught and 273,187 people have been vaccinated in the plague areas and areas close to the plague areas in Hinggan, Jirem, and Ju Ud leagues. The incidence of plague and the death of plague patients this year have been greatly reduced compared to last year (last year, 343 people were infected and 196 died; this year, 19 people were infected and 11 died). There are currently more than 700 epidemic prevention personnel, and permanent epidemic prevention organizations have been established in areas where plague occurs frequently, in order to gradually eliminate plague. Tongliao County, a plague-stricken area, has now been designated as an epidemic prevention experimental county to carry out experiments on eliminating plague. As a result of active plague prevention, Ulanhot City has not had plague for three years.
　　Eradicating syphilis is a major issue related to the people in pastoral areas. This year, a pilot syphilis treatment program was started in Chen Barag Banner in Hulunbuir League, and preliminary experience has been gained, providing effective methods and steps for future syphilis eradication work.
　　Since this spring, except for Chahar League, people's representative conferences at the banner and county level have been held one to three times in various parts of Inner Mongolia. The election of village governments has been universally completed in agricultural areas, further strengthening the ties between the government and the people, further consolidating the broad united front of all strata, and consolidating the people's regime. The close unity between the Mongolian and Han people is being strengthened day by day.
　　In the military field, in the past year, the troops of the Inner Mongolia Military Region and the public security armed forces have combined with the people to basically eliminate large groups of bandits. In the one year to the end of June this year, more than 1,300 bandits were killed, wounded, or captured, protecting production and stabilizing social order. The military technology, cultural knowledge, and political awareness of the troops have been improved. In addition, they have participated in the production and construction movement on a large scale, planting more than 10,000 mu of land, repairing dikes for more than 400,000 workdays, and completing more than 2.2 million cubic meters of earthwork.
　　The achievement of these results is mainly due to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the Central People's Government over the past year, the unprecedented increase in the enthusiasm of the masses for production and labor, and the hard work of party, government, and military cadres at all levels.
　　On the other hand, we still have many shortcomings. We still lack work experience, our knowledge and abilities are still unable to keep up with the requirements of the development of the objective situation, our current work still lacks planning and organization, there is still a lot of blindness in the implementation of policies, and there are still serious bureaucracy and commandism in our work style that are divorced from the masses, and we are still unable to work according to the requirements and awareness of the masses.
　　In order to further advance our work, we must strengthen our study, earnestly implement the spirit of the Party's rectification campaign, strengthen discipline and organization, improve our leadership style and work style, strengthen the overall concept, and improve theoretically, politically, professionally, and culturally, so as to better develop production, do a good job in the united front work of all strata, and further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and the unity of all nationalities. We firmly believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the Central People's Government, we will definitely be able to overcome the shortcomings in our work, continue to improve our knowledge and skills in various tasks, and achieve even greater achievements in the construction work of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region than today.

　　在中央人民政府领导下内蒙古一年来的建设工作
    乌兰夫
    伟大的中华人民共和国成立一周年纪念日到了，我们衷心热烈庆祝各民族共同祖国的国庆节日。
    由于新中国的建立，国内的民族关系已经起了根本变化，各民族正在依照共同纲领中的民族政策建设着各民族友爱合作的大家庭。
    当此庆祝国庆节时，回顾我们内蒙自治区一年来的工作，以求继续前进是必要的。
    一年来内蒙在中央人民政府的领导与帮助下，在内蒙党政军各级干部努力下，执行了中央人民政府的各项政策，首先我们坚决执行了发展农、牧、林、合作社事业为主的生产政策，并取得了伟大成绩。
    今年在农业生产上，除极小部分耕地外，将去年耕地面积一千四百余万亩都已播种，另外开荒五十九万八千五百八十亩，完成原计划的百分之一○一点九，共计扩大了耕地面积四十余万亩。呼、兴、昭三个盟扩大水田二十二万四千八百二十亩，完成原计划百分之九七点四。呼、兴、昭、哲四个盟施肥面积占总播种面积的百分之三二点五一，施肥面积较去年的三百二十二万七千一百八十亩增加了二分之一。这在地广人稀、耕作技术较落后的内蒙来说，确系一个显著进步。
    为了完成增产任务发挥劳动效率，引导农民逐步地按照自愿和互利原则组织了各种形式的劳动互助和生产合作。在春耕夏锄中，曾组织群众向风、虫、霜、雪、冻、雹等各种灾害进行斗争，翻种遭灾土地十五万余亩，特别是进行了紧张的修堤垒坝，抢救防汛的工程。哲盟春季修堤达四百余万工，夏季严防了西辽河两岸的泛滥，使通辽、开鲁、东科中旗等地百余万亩良田免于水患，得到丰收。经过上述努力除兴安盟及呼纳盟部分地区，因旱灾歉收又加昭、哲两盟秋旱秋霜灾情较普遍，一般是中等收成，但还保持了去年一百一十万吨的生产水平。
    在我们发展生产上，仅次于农业的就是畜牧业。内蒙自治区的面积约有五分之三是牧业区，百分之九的人口从事畜牧经济。在牧业区我们坚决执行了恢复与发展牧畜业的方针，保护幼畜及合理管理牧群，实行放牧自由，采取奖励繁殖牲畜的政策及税率百分之一的轻税政策。根据现有材料的统计，已经达到了今年要求，锡、察、昭三个盟“停止下降，争取上升”和呼、纳、兴、哲四个盟纯增殖百分之十五的目标。为保证牲畜的增殖：①曾发动了大规模的打狼运动，据呼纳、昭、锡、察四个盟的现有统计，已打狼八千一百余只，达到内蒙全年打狼任务一万二千只的三分之二；②大力训练了家畜防疫人员，进行了家畜防疫工作，据现有不完全材料，已进行兔化毒牛疫预防注射和炭疽预防注射一百四十八万三千余头（现仍在进行）；③进行了调剂种畜防止母畜失配；④修盖畜栅、打井、储草、调剂与保护牧场；⑤奖励劳模，通过“那达慕”大会及“祭敖包”等集会进行了生产教育；⑥加强干部思想教育，纠正了干部中“重农轻牧”、“牧业经济无前途”的错误观点。
    今年的林业采伐任务是四十万立方米，现已完成预定计划。在林业的经营及护林上，比较去年有了进步，主要表现在依靠工人、加强生产的民主管理，开始实行合理采伐、降低伐根、利用稍头木、保留母树等。今后将更要加强严防火灾，充实林业机构，以护林为主，并有计划的育林，合理经营，克服浪费。
    在工商业合作社方面，我们去年仅有各种合作社四百四十一处，资金四百九十亿元蒙币，社员十八万人，今年发展到各种合作社八百零九处，资金一千九百亿元蒙币，社员四十四万人。这些合作社与国营贸易机关有密切连系，曾发挥了相当大的扶助生产、减少中间剥削的作用。
    内蒙地区私营工商业也有发展：以海拉尔市的调查为例，今年共有工业与手工业四百二十二家，一九四六年仅有一百四十三家；职工在一九四六年有四百二十六人，今年增加到一千三百八十四人；资金由十八亿八千五百二十万元蒙币，今年增加到二百一十一亿六千八百六十四万元蒙币。商业方面，一九四六年四月有一百三十七家，职工五百一十四人，资金十三亿二千五百万元蒙币，到一九五○年三月增加到三百七十二家，职工一千零六十九人，资金一百九十五亿一千五百万元蒙币。
    文教工作方面，现有小学二千八百七十四所，学生二十三万八千九百七十名，入学儿童占学龄儿童百分之六一。今年入学儿童较去年增加四分之一强。去冬今春在东部四盟组织了冬学二千六百七十一处，学员达三十万六千余人。东部四盟九个月来销行蒙汉文教科书一百二十万册和蒙汉文普遍书刊四十二万册（内比重最大的是文化课本和通俗读物），蒙汉文各种杂志一万二千多份，据八月份统计各种报纸共销一万四千余份。内蒙自治区现出刊蒙汉文各种报纸、画报、杂志十一种。其他社会教育和文艺活动正逐步开展，广播事业开始建立。
    在卫生工作方面，今年继续努力于防治鼠疫的工作，到八月为止，兴、哲、昭三盟鼠疫区及接近鼠疫区已捕鼠七百三十八万只，生菌注射二十七万三千一百八十七人。今年鼠疫发生和鼠疫患者的死亡已较去年大为减少（去年发病三百四十三人，死亡一百九十六人，今年发病十九人，死亡十一人）。现有防疫人员七百余名，并在连发鼠疫地区建立了经常性的防疫组织，以便逐步作到消灭鼠疫。现在已将鼠疫严重地区的通辽县划为防疫实验县，进行着消灭鼠疫的试验工作。由于积极预防鼠疫的结果乌兰浩特市不发生鼠疫已经三年了。
    扫除梅毒的工作是关系到畜牧区人民的大问题，今年开始在呼纳盟陈巴旗梅毒治疗试点，已取得了初步经验为今后扫除梅毒工作提出了有效方法和步骤。
    从今春起，除察盟外，内蒙各地均已召开了旗县人民代表会议一次到三次。农业区普遍完成了村政权的选举，进一步密切了政府与人民的连系，更加巩固了广泛团结各阶层的统一战线，巩固了人民政权。蒙汉各民族人民之间的亲密团结正在日益加强。
    在军事方面，一年来内蒙军区部队、公安武装与人民相结合，基本上消灭了流窜的大股土匪，至今年六月底的一年间，毙伤俘匪一千三百余人，保卫了生产，安定了社会秩序。部队的军事技术、文化知识和政治觉悟均有提高。此外并大规模地参加了生产建设运动，种地一万余亩，修堤四十多万工，完成了二百二十多万土方。
    以上这些成绩的取得，主要是由于毛主席党中央以及中央人民政府一年来的正确领导。人民群众生产积极性和劳动热情空前的提高，以及党政军各级干部努力工作的结果。
    在这些成绩的另一方面，我们还存在着许多缺点，我们的工作经验还是很缺乏，我们的知识和能力还赶不上客观形势发展的要求，我们今天的工作还缺乏计划性和组织性，在执行政策中，存在着不少的盲目性，在作风上还存在着严重的脱离群众的官僚主义和命令主义，还不能善于按着群众的要求和觉悟程度来办事。
    为了使我们的工作更前进一步，必须加强学习，认真贯彻全党整风精神，加强纪律性和组织性，改进领导作风与工作作风，加强整体观念，从理论上、政治上、业务上、文化上提高一步，更好地发展生产，作好各阶层统一战线工作，进一步巩固人民民主专政，巩固各民族的团结。深信在毛主席党中央领导下，在中央人民政府领导下，我们一定能克服自己工作中的缺点，继续提高各项工作的知识与技术，使内蒙自治区的建设工作，获得比今天更大的成就。
