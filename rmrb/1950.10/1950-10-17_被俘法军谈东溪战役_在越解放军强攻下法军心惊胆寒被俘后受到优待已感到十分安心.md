Xinhua News Agency, Gaoping Front, October 14th: A soldier named Rastoude from the French Foreign Legion, who was captured during the Dongkhe battle in late September, fully exposed the low morale of the invading French army in a conversation with a special correspondent from "Voice of Vietnam" radio station. Rastoude was a sailor from Le Havre, France, and had been sentenced to prison for robbery. He wanted to escape prison life, so he joined the French Foreign Legion.

Recalling the Dongkhe battle, Rastoude said: My officer told me that the Viet Minh were very cruel, and if they caught you, they would definitely cut off your head and genitals. But at the same time, he told me not to be afraid, because "the Viet Minh are a disorganized rabble" and would not dare to attack Dongkhe at all. I believed this and felt very relieved, but also scared. But on the morning of September 16th, the Vietnamese Liberation Army actually attacked Dongkhe. I was stunned to see that the Vietnamese Liberation Army had so many American-made cannons, machine guns, mortars, etc. The Vietnamese Liberation Army's artillery and machine gun fire were very accurate, causing us great casualties. For two days and two nights, I held a machine gun, crouching in the bunker and not daring to raise my head. The shouts of the Vietnamese Liberation Army were terrifying. Seeing many officers and soldiers being killed, I knew that Dongkhe could not be defended, so I groped through the trenches and escaped into the mountains. I wandered in the forest for five days, both scared and hungry. When I was captured, I thought I was finished. But the Vietnamese Liberation Army treated me so well, which greatly surprised me. They asked about my family, my past, and my future with the best attitude. Since I joined the French Foreign Legion, my officers have never asked us these things. Now, I am very relieved. I know that the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army is fighting for justice, which is why their morale is so high. They will definitely win. As for the morale of our French army, there is no need to talk about it. We are shooting for money.

　　被俘法军谈东溪战役
    在越解放军强攻下法军心惊胆寒被俘后受到优待已感到十分安心
    【新华社十六日讯】据越南通讯社高平前线十四日讯：九月下旬东溪战役中被俘的法国驻外兵团的士兵拉斯汤德，在与“越南之声”电台特派员的谈话中，充分暴露了侵越法军士气的低落。拉斯汤德是法国哈佛尔港的水手，曾因强劫罪被判徒刑。他想逃避牢狱生活，就参加了法国驻外兵团。
    拉斯汤德在忆述东溪战役时说：我的长官曾告诉我说，越盟是非常残忍的，被他们捉住一定要砍头，而且要割下生殖器。但他同时又叫我不要害怕，因为“越盟是乌合之众”，根本就不敢来打东溪。我也这样相信，觉得很安心，同时也觉得害怕。但在九月十六日早上，越南解放军竟进攻东溪，我看到越南解放军有那样多的美国制造的大炮、机关枪、迫击炮等，不禁目瞪口呆。越南解放军的炮火和机关枪火力非常准确，造成我们很大的杀伤。我两天两夜抱着机关枪，蹲在掩体里不敢抬起头来。越南解放军的喊杀声使人心惊胆寒。眼看着许多官兵被打死，我知道东溪守不住了，因此在战壕里摸索着逃到山里去。我在森林里流浪了五天，又怕又饿。在我被捉住时，我认定我是完了。可是越南解放军对待我这样好，使我大为惊奇。他们以最好的态度询问我的家庭、我的过去、以及我的将来。自从我参加法国驻外兵团以来，我的官长们从来没有询问我们这些事。现在，我是十分安心了，我知道越南人民解放军是为正义而战，这就是为什么他们士气这样高。他们一定会得到胜利的。至于我们法军的士气，那就不必谈，我们是为拿钱而开枪的。
