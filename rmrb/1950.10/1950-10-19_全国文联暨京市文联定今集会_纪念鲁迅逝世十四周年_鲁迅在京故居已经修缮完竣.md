    The National Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Beijing Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Workers will hold a memorial meeting at the Youth Palace at 8:30 this morning to commemorate the 14th anniversary of the death of China's great literary mentor, Lu Xun. The meeting will be presided over by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Lu Dingyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Hu Qiaomu, Director of the News Administration, heads of various agencies, foreign guests, and combat heroes will attend and speak at the meeting. After the meeting, a film based on Lu Xun's posthumous work "Blessing" will be screened.

    Lu Xun's former residence in Beijing (21 West Third Alley, Gongmenkou, Xicheng District), was donated to the Central People's Government by Xu Guangping in June this year. The property includes fourteen rooms, more than 5,000 books, more than 4,000 rubbings of bronze and stone inscriptions, and 393 pieces of furniture and cultural relics, all of which have been received and kept by the Cultural Relics Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government. The buildings had been in disrepair for many years, and were repaired last summer with funds allocated by the former North China People's Government Higher Education Council. This year, the Cultural Relics Bureau carried out more thorough renovations while maintaining the original appearance. This project was completed in early September. Xu Guangping actively assisted in this work, arranging the interior furnishings to resemble the way Lu Xun lived during his lifetime. The site is regularly open for visits from all walks of life.
