　　Peace Signature Campaign Youth League Members
    ——Compiled by China Youth Press
    All Youth League members of the Shandong Branch Printing Factory of Xinhua Bookstore launched a letter-writing signature campaign. In four days, Youth League members and young workers from the factory's four departments—typesetting, letterpress printing, lithographic printing, and binding—wrote a total of 145 letters. Zhao Xuezeng, a model worker, said in a letter to his father: "Don't think that signing is useless. Peace-loving people all over the world have signed. This shows that we have great strength, making the imperialists tremble!" (Propaganda Department of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Youth League)

    Wang Dianjun, a Youth League member from Zongmen Elementary School in the Fifth District of Jingxian County, Hebei Province, learned in the Youth League branch's discussion on opposing American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Korea and the peace signature campaign that the peace signature campaign is a major political task at present, and in order to defend world peace, it is necessary to go deep into the masses and do a good job in propaganda. After returning to the village, he first explained the meaning of the signature in detail to the village cadres, and then discussed how to cooperate in the work. He first took charge of the loudspeaker and carried out extensive propaganda to the masses. Taking advantage of lunch and dinner breaks and the masses' rest time, he went into the masses in sections and from house to house, dispelling the masses' ideological concerns in a casual way, and finally carried out the signature campaign. On the first day, 50 people signed. He saw that the women in the village often gathered in groups of three or five to spin thread in the evening, and he thought this was a good place, so on the third night he carried out propaganda to the women, first chatting with them about major domestic and foreign affairs, and then talking about the peace signature campaign. As soon as he brought it up, the women said one after another: "What signature? I don't understand," "Does signing require something, or does it require people to fight?" Wang Dianjun patiently and repeatedly explained a few times according to the questions raised by the women. Finally, the women said: "Signing is originally to oppose the American devils and show the strength of our people." "The Japanese devils and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits were driven away not long ago, and the American devils want to occupy our place again. That's not allowed. Our Chinese people must defeat them." That night, 27 women signed. After lunch on the fourth day, many people were resting under a big tree, and Wang Dianjun went to chat with everyone again, first explaining the domestic and foreign situation, and then said that they should participate in the signature campaign. A member of the masses, Liu Rulin, asked: "Are we signing to ask the United States for peace, or are we afraid of the United States?" Dianjun used the situation of the American army suffering a major defeat in Korea to explain that American imperialism is a paper tiger, and we are not afraid of it. Signing is to strengthen unity, showing that we peace-loving people all over the world are united together, in order to smash the imperialists' conspiracy to launch a war. After his explanation, Liu Rulin said: "Our people want to live a peaceful life. We don't allow him to launch a war. If he launches a war, we will definitely fight him to the end. Sign me up first!" Others did not lag behind, and in a short time, 26 people signed.
    Through his four days of efforts, he mobilized 226 people to sign.

    Comrade Ge Yao, the principal of the Eighth Primary School in Guisui City, is the secretary of the school's Youth League branch. During the peace signature campaign, he mobilized teachers and students to launch 20,078 people to sign the peace declaration from August 31 to September 8, becoming an outstanding promoter of the peace signature campaign.
    As soon as the peace signature campaign started, Comrade Ge Yao expressed: Youth League members should actively respond to the call of our country and He Da, and do their best. However, some teachers and comrades there believed that they did not need to care about others after signing themselves and their families. He explained this situation, explaining that defending peace is everyone's responsibility. As a result, more than 40 teachers and students immediately joined the movement.
    On the afternoon of August 31, they first launched propaganda in the streets and alleys of Chengguan and Xiaoshi. However, due to the lack of sound planning and organization, and the fact that the villagers did not understand what they were saying, the results were not great. The next day, after the signature campaign moved to the countryside, Comrade Ge Yao emphasized the method of chatting. They were divided into five groups, led by Ge Yao and four other teachers, and carried out propaganda in a conversational manner while the villagers were resting. An old man listened to the students' propaganda and said: "When the Japanese devils were here, let alone living a good life, we couldn't even sleep peacefully; now that we are about to live a good life, the American devils want to bully us again. We will drive them away with sickles and hammers!" An old man heard that American planes had bombed and killed our compatriots in the Northeast, and remembered his son who had been captured by the Kuomintang bandit army, and was very angry. Not only did he sign himself and his family, but he also mobilized three other families to sign.
    Ge Yao and the school's teachers and students mobilized up to 5,000 people to sign in one day during the rural signature campaign. As of September 8, they had collected 20,078 signatures. (Li Jianhua, Suiyuan Provincial Committee of the Youth League)

    The Youth League committees at all levels in Tongxian County played an organizational role in the peace signature campaign. They used preaching stations, and branch instructors explained to Youth League members. After more than 38,000 Youth League members in the entire region signed, they adopted methods such as disguises, loudspeakers, blackboards, paintings, and chats to go deep into each household to carry out propaganda. In the Fourth District of Daxing County, more than 8,500 people signed under the promotion of Youth League members. Young Wu Jiazhong said: "We are not afraid of the United States dropping atomic bombs. Let them see how powerful we are!" After the Youth League branch secretary of Northwest Corner of Jixian County understood the meaning of signing, he alone mobilized 499 people to sign, accounting for 90 percent of the village's population.

    The Youth League County Work Committee in Yingcheng, Hubei Province, attached great importance to the peace signature campaign. The youth cadre meeting on September 20 decided to make the peace signature campaign the center of current propaganda and education work. Under such arrangements and calls, Youth League members in various districts have achieved many results. The propaganda group organized by nine Youth League members and twelve students in Wanshang Town mobilized 1,200 people to sign, accounting for 80 percent of the town's population. Young Xiong Daming in Meowan signed for himself and also signed for his blind mother. Nine Youth League members in Yangjiahe went to the countryside in three groups every day to carry out propaganda, winning 1,000 signatures.

    Under the unified arrangement of the peace signature campaign committee, the Youth League organizations at all levels in southern Anhui launched enthusiastic propaganda. They also formed propaganda teams with trade unions and student unions to go to the countryside to carry out propaganda. As of September 20, preliminary statistics from eight counties including Xiuning, Shexian, Jingde, Jixi, Qimen, Yixian, Wuhu, and Qingyang, and two cities, Wuhu and Tunxi, showed that 83,376 Youth League members and youths participated in the signature campaign. Qingyang County alone had 17,775 people. The people's desire and confidence in loving peace were fully expressed in the peace signature propaganda. An old lady in Gaoyang Village, Qingyang County, heard her son say: "We signed at school to defend world peace." The next morning, she pulled her crutches and ran to the signature place and said, "My son signed at school. Hurry up and write my name too. Which of us doesn't want to live a peaceful life?" Youths in various places have also improved their understanding of defending world peace and opposing American aggression from this movement.

    Since the Youth League District Work Committee in Yishui Special District, Shandong Province, responded to the call of the He Da East China Branch Preparatory Committee, it has collected more than 127,000 youth signatures, including 20,095 Youth League members and 2,465 Young Pioneers. During the peace signature campaign, the crimes of American imperialism in invading Korea and Taiwan were widely publicized. When demobilized soldier Wang Lianke heard that American imperialism was about to launch a third world war, he glared and said angrily: "The past was a time of war, and now it has turned to peaceful production and construction. I was demobilized from the front and returned home. If American imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression, I will definitely return to the front line." After five young people in Gaoqiao District, Jiuyi County signed, they automatically joined the militia and used the action of protecting the autumn harvest to defend world peace.

    新华书店山东分店印刷工厂全体青年团员发动一封信签名运动。四天内全厂行制、铅印、石印、装订四部团员和青工共写了一四五封信，质量模范赵学增给他父亲信中说：“别以为签名不顶事，全世界爱好和平的都签了。这就表示我们有很大的力量，让帝国主义者发抖吧！”（青年团山东省工委宣传部）

    河北景县五区宗门完小团员王殿君，在团支部讨论反对美帝侵略台湾、朝鲜及和平签名的会议上，知道了和平签名是当前重大的政治任务，为了保卫世界和平，必须深入群众，做好宣传工作。回村后，他首先找村干部将签名的意义详细的解说了一遍，然后就商量在工作中如何配合。他首先掌握了广播筒，向群众进行广泛的宣传。利用午、晚饭场及群众休息时间，分段、挨户深入到群众中去，用漫谈的方式，解除群众的思想顾虑，最后进行签名。第一天就有群众五十人签了名。他见到村中妇女们晚上常三五个聚在一起纺线，他想这是个好地点，于是，第三天晚上他就对妇女们进行宣传，先跟她们扯了些国内外大事，又扯到和平签名，刚提了个头，妇女们就你一言她一语的说：“什么签名？俺闹不清”、“签名是要东西呢，还是要人打仗呢？”王殿君就根据着妇女们提出来的问题，耐心的反复解说了几遍，最后，妇女们说：“签名原是为了反对美国鬼子，表示咱们老百姓的力量。”“日本鬼子和蒋匪军被赶走了不久，美国鬼子又想来占咱们的地方，那可不行，咱中国人民一定要把它打垮的。”这天晚上就有二十七个妇女签了名。第四天午饭后，许多人在大树底下休息，王殿君又去和大家漫扯，先解说了国内外形势，又说是要参加签名。群众刘汝林问：“咱签名是要求美国和平呢？还是怕美国？”殿君用美军在朝鲜吃大败仗情形说明美帝是个纸老虎，咱们并不怕它。签名是为了加强团结，表示咱全世界爱好和平人民都团结在一起，是为了粉碎帝国主义发动战争的诡计。经他解说后，刘汝林说：“咱老百姓要过安生日子，咱不许可他发起战争，它发起战争咱一定和他干到底，先给咱签上名吧！”旁人也都不落后，不多工夫，就有二十六个人签了名。
    经过他四天的努力，动员了二百二十六人签了名。

    归绥市立第八完小校长戈耀同志是该校团支部书记。在和平签名运动中，他动员了教师与学生，从八月三十一日到九月八日发动了二万零七十八人在和平宣言上签名，成为和平签名运动中杰出推动者。
    和平签名运动刚一开始，戈耀同志就表示：青年团员应该积极响应我国和大的号召，尽自己最大的力量。但当地有些教师与同志认为自己与家庭签名之后就不必再管别人了。他针对这种情况，进行解释，说明保卫和平是每个人的责任。于是四十多个教师和学生立即投入了这一运动。
    八月三十一日下午，他们首先在城关街巷与小市上展开了宣传。但因计划与组织不够健全，说话老乡又不懂，收效不大。第二天，签名运动转入农村以后，戈耀同志强调了拉家常的办法。他们分为五个组，由戈耀与其他四位老师领导，趁老乡休息的时候，分别用谈话方式进行宣传。一个老汉听了同学的宣传说：“日本鬼子在这儿的时候，不用说日子过不好，连个安生觉也睡不成；这会儿刚要好好过日子，美国鬼子又想来欺侮咱们。咱们拿镰刀和锤头也要把它赶走！”一个老人听说美国飞机炸死了我们东北的同胞，记起了被国民党匪军抓走的儿子，非常气愤，他不但自己与全家签了名，同时还发动另外三家也签了名。
    戈耀与该校师生在农村签名运动中最多一天曾动员到五千人签名，截至九月八日，他们征集的签名人数达二万零七十八名。（绥远省团工委李建华）

    山东沂水专区青年团地工委自响应了和大华东分会筹委会的号召后，已征集了十二万七千多青年签名，其中团员有二万零九十五人，少年儿童队员二四六五人。在和平签名运动中，普遍宣传了美帝侵略朝鲜台湾的罪行。复员军人王连珂听到美帝要发动第三次世界大战时，气得瞪圆了眼说：“过去是战争时期，现在转向和平生产建设了。我是从前方复员回家的，美帝如敢发动侵略战争，我一定重上前线。”旧沂县高桥区五个青年签名后，自动参加了民兵队，用保护秋收的行动保卫世界和平。（山东沂水团地工委赵笃杰）
