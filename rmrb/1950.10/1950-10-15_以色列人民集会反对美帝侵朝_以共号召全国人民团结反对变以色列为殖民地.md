　　Xinhua News Agency, Tel Aviv: TASS reports: Recent mass rallies for peace held in several locations in Tel Aviv have unanimously approved resolutions demanding that the Israeli government cease its cooperation with the Anglo-American bloc and oppose the aggression against Korea. The mass rallies also expressed their support for the Korean people's liberation struggle against the American aggressors.
    The Central Committee of the Israeli Communist Party and the Central Committee of the "Mapam" Party simultaneously issued statements on the 11th, strongly condemning the attitude of the Israeli delegation on the Korean question at the United Nations General Assembly. The Communist Party called on the working class and the masses of the people nationwide to "unite to defend peace, to oppose the crisis of a new war, and to oppose turning Israel into a colony of Wall Street."
