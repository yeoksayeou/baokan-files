　　Comrade Zuo Quan's Spirit Lives On
    Xie Juezai
    Comrade Zuo Quan was from Liling, Hunan. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1925, graduated from the Whampoa Military Academy, and later went to Moscow to study at the Military University. He returned to China in 1930 to work in the Central Soviet Area. After the Long March, he arrived in northern Shaanxi and in 1936, he served as the acting commander of the Red Army's First Army Corps. During the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War, the Red Army was reorganized into the Eighth Route Army of the National Revolutionary Army, and Comrade Zuo Quan served as the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Eighth Route Army. He led his troops deep behind enemy lines, fought bravely in North China, ignited the anti-Japanese fervor of the people of North China, and established anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines. Comrade Zuo Quan left indelible and glorious achievements in the construction of our people's army and the history of the Anti-Japanese War. The people will always commemorate him, and will always commemorate him in the victory of destroying imperialism and its bandit gangs. On June 2, 1942, Comrade Zuo Quan heroically sacrificed his life in the anti-Japanese "mopping-up" campaign in the Matian area, southeast of Liaoxian County, Taihang Mountain, at the young age of thirty-six.

    Comrade Zuo Quan was an outstanding member and general of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. He worked selflessly throughout his life, and his sacrifice was a great loss to the Chinese people. In the eight years since his passing, the Chinese people have inherited his will, continued his cause, and learned from his revolutionary spirit. Finally, they drove the Japanese invaders who killed him and the reactionary demons he hated off the stage of history, and replaced them with the Chinese people he faithfully served, and established their own government, achieving great victories on all fronts. This is enough to comfort our beloved Comrade Zuo Quan.

    Comrade Zuo Quan's ideal has been victoriously achieved, but American imperialism is frantically trying to prevent the victory of the Chinese people, attempting to permanently enslave those who strive for freedom and liberation, and has now begun its bloody aggression in Korea. Comrade Zuo Quan! Although you are dead, you always live in the hearts of every revolutionary person. In particular, your selfless and loyal revolutionary spirit has become a sharp weapon of struggle for the broad masses of people. The people assure you and warn American imperialism and all other aggressors that the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world are as brave as you in the face of the enemy. Anyone who dares to invade will surely be met with a bloody nose and will repeat the shameful path of Japanese imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

    Comrade Zuo Quan! Rest in peace! Your mausoleum and your contributions to the people will shine upon the world like the sun and the moon!
                                            October 17, 1950.

　　左权同志精神不死
    谢觉哉
    左权同志湖南醴陵人，一九二五年加入中国共产党，黄埔军校毕业，后赴莫斯科入军事大学。一九三○年归国，到中央苏区工作，长征到达陕北，一九三六年任红军第一军团代军团长。“七七”抗战，红军改编为国民革命军第八路军，左权同志任八路军副参谋长。率部深入敌后，奋战华北，激起华北人民抗日热潮，建立敌后抗日根据地。左权同志在我人民军队的建设及抗战史中曾留下不可磨灭的、辉煌的功绩，人民将永远纪念着他，在摧毁帝国主义及其匪帮的胜利中永远纪念着他。一九四二年六月二日左权同志在太行山辽县东南麻田地区反日寇“扫荡”战役中，壮烈牺牲，年仅三十六岁。
    左权同志是中国共产党及人民解放军的一个优秀党员与将领，他一生忘我地工作着，他的牺牲是中国人民的绝大损失。中国人民在离开他的八年岁月中，秉承他的意志，继续他的事业，学习他的革命精神、终于将杀死他的日寇和他仇恨的反动恶魔打下历史舞台，而代之以他所忠心为之服务的中国人民，并建立了自己的政府，在各种战线上取得了伟大的胜利，这些，足以告慰我们亲爱的左权同志。
    左权同志的理想是胜利的达到了，但是美帝国主义疯狂的想阻止中国人民的胜利，企图永远奴役争取自由解放的人们，目前并在朝鲜开始了他的血腥侵略。左权同志！你虽死，但你始终活在每个革命人民的心上，特别是你奋不顾己，忠心耿耿的革命精神，已经变成了广大人民锐利的斗争武器。人民向你保证并警告美帝国主义及其他一切侵略者，中国人民和世界上一切爱好和平的人民在敌人面前都象你那样英勇，谁要敢于侵略，其结果一定会碰得头破血流，重走日本帝国主义及蒋介石匪帮的可耻道路。
    左权同志！安息吧！你的陵园和你对人民的功绩，将同日月之光，永照于人世！
                                            一九五○、十、十七。
