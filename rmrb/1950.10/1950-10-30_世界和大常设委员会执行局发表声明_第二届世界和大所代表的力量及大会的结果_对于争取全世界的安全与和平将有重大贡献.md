Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 28th: The Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress held a meeting in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, from the 25th to the 26th. The meeting issued a statement stating that: The Executive Bureau has discussed the proposals submitted by the Preparatory Committee of the Second World Peace Congress, the National Peace Committees, and individuals and groups regarding the agenda of the Second World Peace Congress for the past two days. These suggestions are all concerned with how to defend peace, and also deeply believe, like us, in the necessity of uniting to act together. The Executive Bureau welcomes this and has decided to submit the proposals concerning the agenda and the progress of the Congress to the Second World Peace Congress for approval.

In order to ensure that all opinions can be expressed and all initiatives can be put forward, the Executive Bureau proposes that, in addition to the discussions in the plenary session, the work of specialized committees should be supplemented to enrich the content of the discussions. The activities of these committees will make it possible to adopt the knowledge of all those who can assist in formulating peace regulations. In adopting these decisions, the Executive Bureau firmly believes that any opinion, as long as it is for resolutely acting together to defend peace, can coexist at this Congress.

The statement continued: The British Peace Committee has reported to the Executive Bureau on the preparations for the Congress. The Executive Bureau noted with satisfaction that all necessary measures have been taken to create conditions commensurate with the world significance of the Congress. To this end, the Executive Bureau expressed its gratitude to the British Peace Committee.

The statement pointed out: At present, the first batches of delegations have departed from various countries to Britain. The Executive Bureau pays tribute to the people all over the world who have elected representatives and pinned their hopes on the Sheffield Congress.

In their activities, peace advocates have from the beginning reminded people of the threat of war and called on all nations to be vigilant. At present, no one can ignore the fact that the current conflict is full of disasters, and all countries will be drawn into this vortex, and no nation can escape.

Peace advocates know that a force is growing all over the world, and as long as all nations unite and jointly participate in the struggle to stop disasters, these forces are sufficient to stop war and consolidate peace.

The statement finally declared: The strength represented by the Second World Peace Congress and the results of the Congress will make a significant contribution to the struggle for security and peace throughout the world and the effort to achieve coexistence among various social systems and countries.
