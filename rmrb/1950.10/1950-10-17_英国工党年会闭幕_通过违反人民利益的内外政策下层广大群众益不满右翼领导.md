Xinhua News Agency, 12th. The 49th Annual Conference of the British Labour Party, which began on October 2nd in Margate, England, concluded on the 6th. Under the manipulation of the Labour Party Executive Committee, the conference passed the Executive Committee's proposals on foreign and domestic affairs, supporting the Labour government's reactionary policy of relying on the United States for arms expansion and war preparation, and the domestic policy program of so-called building a "New Society" to deceive the people. However, during the course of the meeting, the Labour government's internal and external policies that violated the interests of the British people were still fiercely criticized by many representatives, exposing the growing dissatisfaction of the broad masses of the Labour Party at the lower levels with the right-wing leadership.

The focus of this meeting was the discussion on foreign policy issues on October 5th. According to a TASS report: After the Executive Committee put forward its reactionary foreign policy proposal, Labour MP Davies, on behalf of a significant number of Labour Party local organizations and trade unions, put forward a comprehensive proposal based on about thirty proposals, urging the government to strive to avoid the increasing danger of war by the following methods: 1. Convene a five-power conference; 2. Establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union; 3. Support the declaration of atomic bombs and all other weapons of mass destruction as illegal; 4. Avoid all actions that violate the United Nations Charter; 5. End trade barriers between East and West; 6. Take further action to allow the People's Republic of China to join the Security Council; 7. End dependence on the dollar in 1925. Many speakers who supported the comprehensive proposal pointed out that there is a great fear among ordinary people in Britain that war is imminent. Two young representatives called on the conference to support the bill. Miss Lewis said: "The government should extend a hand of friendship to the Soviet Union, not a hand of hostility." Bridge said: "The United States is asking for war, our young people do not want war, and will not tolerate war." Another representative, Hughes, in his speech, attacked the Labour government's war preparation policy. Referring to the Executive Committee's supplementary report on the international situation accusing the Korean People's Army of "aggression," he said: "This is a culmination of fabricated lies to deceive people, which, like the statement on foreign policy, brings shame to the Labour Party."

Although the annual conference finally passed the Executive Committee's proposal and rejected the comprehensive proposal demanding peace and maintaining British independence in the vote; the comprehensive proposal still gained a considerable number of votes of more than 880,000 from two national trade unions and 39 local Labour Party organizations.

At the meeting held on the 4th to discuss domestic policies, the Executive Committee used the means of suppressing the proposals of various local Labour Party organizations opposing the government's policies and not discussing them, and passed a policy statement entitled "The Labour Party and the New Society". However, this unscrupulous manipulation was strongly opposed by some representatives. According to a TASS report: Manchester representative Lant protested the Executive Committee's suppression of the proposal, and said: "Ordinary party members feel great unease about the current policy trend."

According to a Telecommunications Agency report: A representative from Stratherem exposed the hypocrisy of this policy statement boasting of a "New Society," saying: "It is meaningless to the gas strike workers who are currently being persecuted."

The annual conference passed a proposal put forward by various trade unions on the 3rd, demanding increased wages, reduced prices, and controlled profits, which marked the bankruptcy of the Labour government's policy of freezing wages since 1948 to carry out arms expansion and war preparation plans at the expense of the working class. Even the Associated Press pointed out: At the meeting on the 3rd, "the fiery barrage of attacks from trade union leaders and left-wing members of parliament forced Attlee's Labour Party Executive Committee to retreat on its wage freeze policy."

The last meeting on the 6th passed a resolution supporting the Labour Party Executive Committee's policy statement that Britain refused to participate in the so-called Schuman Plan. Dalton, the Minister of Town and Country Planning who participated in the drafting of the statement, pointed out at the meeting: "The Labour government has no intention of giving up control over the national coal and steel industries." The Labour Party's insistence on its opposition to the Schuman Plan and its efforts to maintain its position as a "Pound Sterling Area banker" reflects that Britain will continue to resist the United States' plan on this issue.

### 英国工党年会闭幕  通过违反人民利益的内外政策下层广大群众益不满右翼领导

　　英国工党年会闭幕
    通过违反人民利益的内外政策下层广大群众益不满右翼领导
    【新华社十二日讯】十月二日起在英国马尔盖特举行的英国工党第四十九届年会，已于六日结束。年会在工党执委会的操纵下，通过了执委会关于外交内政的提案，支持工党政府所采取的投靠美国扩军备战的反动政策，与欺骗人民的所谓建立“新社会”的内政纲领。但是在会议进程中，工党政府违反英国人民利益的内外政策，仍然受到许多代表的猛烈斥责，暴露了工党下层广大群众对右翼领导的不满已日益增长。
    这次会议的中心，是十月五日关于外交政策问题的讨论。据塔斯社报道：在执委会提出其反动的外交政策提案后，工党议员戴维斯即代表相当大一部分工党地方组织与工会，提出一项根据约三十件提案制定的综合提案，敦促政府以下列办法力求避免日益增加的战争危险：一、召开五强会议；二、与苏联建立友好关系；三、支持宣布原子弹及其他一切有大规模杀伤力的武器为非法；四、避免一切违反联合国宪章的行为；五、结束东方之间的贸易壁垒；六、采取进一步的行动，使中华人民共和国加入安全理事会；七、在一九二五来结束对美元的依赖。许多拥护综合提案的发言者指出，在英国普通人民中间存在着一种害怕战争即将到临的极大恐惧。两位年青代表呼吁会议支持该议案。路易斯小姐说：“政府应向苏联伸出友谊的手，而不是敌意的手”。布里治说：“美国要求战争，我国的青年人不要战争，并且不容忍战争”。另一代表休士在发言中，攻击工党政府的备战政策，他在述及指控朝鲜人民军进行“侵略”的执委会所作关于国际形势补充报告时说：“这是集信口雌黄的欺人之谈的大成，像关于外交政策声明一样使工党蒙受耻辱”。
    虽然年会最后在表决时通过了执委会的提案，并否决了要求和平维护英国独立的综合提案；但是综合提案仍获得了两个全国性的工会和三十九个地方工党组织共八十八万余票的不小票数。
    在四日的举行讨论国内政策的会议上，执委会利用压制各工党地方组织反对政府政策的提案不予讨论的手段，而通过了题为“工党与新社会”的政策声明，但是这种肆无忌惮的操纵手法，遭到若干代表的强烈反对。据塔斯社报道：曼彻斯特代表兰特抗议执委会压制提案，并称：“普通党员对于现在的政策倾向感到很大的不安”。
    另据电通社报道：斯特莱赛姆的代表揭露这一吹嘘“新社会”的政策声明的虚伪性，他说：“对于现在正在遭受迫害的煤气罢工工人，它是没有意义的”。
    年会在三日通过了各工会提出的要求增加工资，减低物价和控制利润的提案，这标志着工党政府一九四八年以来为进行扩军备战计划，因此牺牲工人阶级而实施的冻结工资政策的破产，连美联社都指出：在三日会议上，“工会领袖和左翼议员的炽烈的攻击炮火，迫使艾德礼的工党执行委员会在它的冻结工资政策上后退”。
    六日末次会议通过决议支持工党执委会关于英国拒绝参加所谓舒曼计划的政策声明。参与拟订该项声明的城乡计划大臣达尔顿在会上指出：“工党政府无意放弃对于全国煤钢工业的控制权。”工党坚持其反对舒曼计划并力图保持其“英镑区银行家”地位的立场，反映了英国将继续在这一问题上对美国的计划进行抵抗。
