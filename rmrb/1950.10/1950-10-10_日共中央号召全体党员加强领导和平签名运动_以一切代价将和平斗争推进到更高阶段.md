　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th. TASS reported from Tokyo on the 7th: "Party Activity Guidelines," published by the Propaganda and Education Department of the Japanese Communist Party Headquarters, published on September 27th a letter to all party members from the Japanese Communist Party Temporary Central Guidance Department on the upcoming Second World Congress for the Defense of Peace.

　　The letter stated: "The task of the Second World Congress for the Defense of Peace is to summarize the actual achievements of the worldwide struggle for peace, to express the unwavering determination of all peace-loving peoples of the world, and to bring the struggle for peace to a higher stage. This struggle has received the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life, as evidenced by the good results of the Stockholm Appeal signature campaign. The aim of this movement is to defeat plans to promote a new war. International imperialism and its lackeys, who have moved from preparing for war to open acts of aggression, are brewing this new war."

　　The letter, after pointing out that "Japan's struggle for peace has not completed the goals set by the international movement," continued: "We are still far from fulfilling our international obligations to the world's peace-loving peoples. We have not fulfilled our obligations to the Japanese masses to the necessary extent. The Japanese masses are the first victims of the atomic bomb. They have lived through the various disasters of the war and are now suffering sacrifices due to the construction of new military bases. The Japanese people are loudly declaring: 'We don't want a new war.'"

　　The letter stated: "The conditions for advancing the struggle for peace to a higher new stage are not yet guaranteed. We must overcome this deficiency at all costs." The letter also called on Communist Party members to take the lead, lead the Stockholm Appeal signature campaign, thoroughly expose the role of the right-wing Social Democratic Party, which has become a running dog of the warmongers, strive for legal rights, and send a Japanese delegation to the World Congress for the Defense of Peace.

　　日共中央号召全体党员加强领导和平签名运动
    以一切代价将和平斗争推进到更高阶段
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社七日电引东京消息：日本共产党本部宣传教育部出版的《党活动指针》，于九月二十七日刊载日本共产党临时中央指导部发表的为第二届世界拥护和平大会行将召开告全体党员书。
    告党员书称：“第二届世界拥护和平大会的任务是总结全世界和平斗争的实际成绩，表示世界各爱好和平的民族不折不挠的决心，并将和平斗争提到更高的阶段。这个斗争得到了广泛的各阶层人民的热烈支持，这表现在斯德哥尔摩宣言签名运动的良好结果上。这个运动的目的是要击败促成新战争的计划。已从准备战争进到公开的侵略行动的国际帝国主义和它的走卒，正在酝酿着这个新战争。”
    告党员书在指出“日本的和平斗争没有完成国际运动所规定的目标”后，继称：“我们离完成我们对世界各爱好和平民族的国际义务还差得很远。我们对日本群众的义务没有完成到必需的程度。日本群众是原子弹的第一个受害者，他们从战争的各种灾难中生活过来，现在又因建筑新的军事基地而遭受牺牲。日本人民大声宣告：‘我们不要新战争’。”
    告党员书称：“将和平斗争推进到更高的新阶段的条件，目前还没有保证。我们必须以一切代价克服这个缺陷。”告党员书并号召共产党员起带头作用，领导征集斯德哥尔摩宣言签名运动，彻底揭露已成为战争贩子的走狗的右翼社会民主党的作用。争取合法的权利，派日本的代表团出席世界拥护和平大会。
