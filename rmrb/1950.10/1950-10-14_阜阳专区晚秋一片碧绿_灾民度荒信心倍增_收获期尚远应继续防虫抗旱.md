　　Fuyang Prefecture's Late Autumn a Verdant Green
    Disaster Victims' Confidence in Overcoming Hardship Doubles
    Harvest Season Still Distant, Continued Pest Control and Drought Resistance Needed

    [Our Dispatch] The late autumn crops replanted in the heavily afflicted Fuyang Prefecture of northern Anhui present a scene of verdant green. Sweet potato leaves cover the ridges, and mung bean stems are thick with lush foliage, thriving vigorously. Buckwheat fields are blanketed in white blossoms, and late rice is putting forth green ears. The broad masses in Funan County, a severely affected area, have begun to smile, their confidence in overcoming the disaster has redoubled. This victory was achieved through a challenging work process: seeds were a major problem during the replanting. In addition to the government helping to solve about 80 percent of the needs of severely affected areas and 20 to 30 percent of lightly affected areas, the remaining amount was obtained by the disaster-stricken masses through selling old furniture and timber, economizing on food, and selling chickens and pigs. After the replanting movement was launched, the government mobilized the masses to organize mutual aid teams, overcoming the difficulty of labor shortages. In Fuyang County, more than 11,000 mutual aid teams were organized for replanting. In Qingquan District of Fengtai County, 134 rush-planting teams were organized. Lacking livestock, they used people to pull plows; lacking farm tools, they used grappling hooks and iron hoes, cultivating with hoes and drilling with wooden sticks. The masses overcame all difficulties in various ways and completed the replanting plan of 7.5 million mu. However, after the tender green seedlings emerged, a serious pest infestation occurred. Crickets and mole crickets became the major enemies of the late autumn crops, with entire fields being eaten, posing a serious threat to the lives of the people throughout the area. Leadership at all levels immediately organized forces and mobilized the masses to catch pests. Under the slogans of "Protecting seedlings is like protecting life, eliminating pests is like putting out a fire" and "Protect the autumn harvest, eliminate pest infestations," a campaign to catch and eliminate pests was launched. In渦陽 (Guoyang) alone, more than 120,000 people participated, and in 蒙城 (Mengcheng), the number of participating masses reached more than 80,000, capturing a large number of pests. In 临泉 (Linquan), the participation of more than 200,000 people in pest control resulted in the rescue of more than 80,000 mu of autumn seedlings. In some areas, where the late autumn crops were completely devoured by pests, replanting was carried out immediately. For example, in Tongcheng District of Linquan, more than 2,700 mu were replanted, with 210 mu being destroyed by insects for the first time, 77 mu being destroyed for the second time, and 39 mu being destroyed for the third time. The masses continued replanting three times without any discouragement. Simultaneously with the occurrence of pest damage, the late autumn crops also faced drought conditions. Some people said, "We cannot resist drought, as resistance will lead to flooding." However, Yuan Fengcai and Li Wenxian, the mutual aid team leaders of Laojietou in Cihe District of Fuyang, said, "If it doesn't rain, we will make it rain!" They organized the carrying of water to irrigate the seedlings. Men carried, women watered, and they watered all night by moonlight, and finally all the autumn seedlings in the village emerged. When the people of Shiying Village heard that watering had resulted in seedlings emerging, they also came to carry water to irrigate the seedlings. In order to prevent drought, the masses in various places dug wells. In Zhao Tun District of涡阳 (Guoyang) alone, one township dug more than 500 wells. In Huagou District, more than 100 people were organized to dig 120 wells, enabling more than 580 mu of autumn seedlings to grow vigorously. Ying Shang and Mengcheng also organized irrigation of seedlings. Many areas broke with the idea of relying on heaven for food. They said, "With many people, strength is great, and we are not afraid of anything!" After overcoming the drought, weeding work began to ensure the growth of seedlings and increase production. Grandpa Yang of Saidong Village in颍上 (Yingshang) said, "Although the crops are planted late, diligent weeding once can make up for planting ten days early." Now, many areas have weeded two to three times. In Zhang Haizi Village of Fuyang, weeding was combined with catching insects. When the weeds were pulled, the insects were also caught. The six mu of buckwheat in Ningguang Village were weeded early and caught quickly, and the buckwheat has grown to more than one foot high. These continuous facts of fighting against natural disasters and pest infestations fully demonstrate that the strong and hardworking people can overcome natural disasters with their own labor.

    According to farmers' estimates, the late autumn crops planted this year can yield more than 60 jin per mu for buckwheat and mung beans, and about 2,000 jin per mu for carrots and turnips. If early-maturing crops such as broad beans, rapeseed, and barley are calculated at a yield of 40 to 60 jin per mu, the entire prefecture can harvest 866,678,000 jin of grain this winter and next spring. If there are no other unexpected disasters this winter and next spring, it can solve 80 percent of the entire prefecture's people's livelihood needs. In addition, the Huai River control project has partially started, and work-for-relief provides a further guarantee for overcoming the disaster.

    Although the replanted late autumn crops are generally growing well, the harvest season is still distant, and we must not be complacent or optimistic. The pest infestation in some areas still needs to be vigorously controlled, and with the recent dry weather, drought resistance must continue in order to successfully overcome the disaster.

　　阜阳专区晚秋一片碧绿
    灾民度荒信心倍增
    收获期尚远应继续防虫抗旱
    【本报讯】皖北重灾区阜阳专区补种的晚秋作物，呈现一片碧绿，红芋叶子遮盖了土垅、绿豆茎肥叶绿，欣欣向荣；荞麦田里开遍了白花，晚稻吐出了青穗。重灾区阜南县的广大群众已初开笑颜，战胜灾荒的信心倍增。这一胜利的取得，是经过了一段艰巨的工作过程的：种籽曾是补种中的一项极大问题。除政府帮助重灾区解决了百分之八十左右、帮助轻灾区解决了百分之二十至三十外，其余数目是灾区群众折卖旧家具、木料，省吃、卖去鸡、猪换得的。在补种运动展开后，政府发动群众组织了互助组，克服了缺乏劳动力的困难。阜阳县补种中，整理了一万一千多个互助组。凤台县清泉区组织了一百三十四个抢种组，他们没有牲口，便用人拉犁；缺乏农具用抓钩刨、铁铣挖，锄点、木棒钻。群众以各种办法战胜了一切困难，完成了七百五十万亩的补种计划。但嫩绿的苗儿出土后，又发生了严重的虫灾，蟋蟀、土蚕成了晚秋的大敌，有的整块地被虫吃光，这对全区人民的生活，是一个严重威胁。各级领导机关乃立即组织力量，动员群众捕虫，在“保苗如保命，灭虫如灭火”，“保护秋收，消灭虫灾”的口号下，展开了捕灭虫灾的运动。仅涡阳即有十二万余人参加，蒙城参加的群众达八万余人，捕捉了大量的害虫。临泉二十余万人参加捕虫的结果，救出了八万余亩秋苗。有些地区的晚秋被虫吃光，马上又补种上。如临泉铜城区补种了二千七百余亩，第一次被虫吃毁二百一十亩，二次吃去七十七亩，三次吃去三十九亩，群众一点不灰心地连续补种了三次。与发生虫害同时，晚秋又呈旱象。有的群众说：“可不能抗旱，一抗就发水。”可是阜阳茨河区老街头的互助组长苑凤彩、李文贤却说：“天不下雨咱来下！”他们组织了挑水浇苗，男的挑，女的浇，趁着月光连夜浇，全村秋苗终于出齐。史营村的群众听说浇水出了苗，也来挑水浇苗。为了防旱，各地群众纷纷打井，仅涡阳赵屯区一个乡就挖了五百多眼。花沟区组织了一百多人，打了一百二十眼井，使五百八十多亩秋苗得以茁壮生长。颍上、蒙城也都组织了浇苗。不少地区打破了靠天吃饭的思想，他们说：“人多力量大、干啥也不怕！”战胜旱象之后，为了保苗增产的锄草工作开始。颍上赛洞村的杨老大爷说：“庄稼种的虽晚，勤锄一遍还能抵上早种十天。”现在，不少地区已锄了两遍到三遍。阜阳张海孜村拔草结合捉虫，草拔光了虫也捉完了。宁光村的六亩荞麦，拔得早捉得快，荞麦已长了一尺多高，这些连续不断的与天灾、虫害斗争的事实，充分说明了坚强勤劳的人民是可以用自己的劳动来战胜自然灾害的。
    今年种上的晚秋，据农民的估计，荞麦，绿豆每亩能收六十多斤，胡萝卜、蔓菁每亩能收二千斤左右。蚕豆、油菜、大麦等早熟庄稼，每亩如以四十斤至六十斤收成计算，今冬明春全专区可收八亿六千六百七十八万斤粮，如果今冬明春无其他意外灾害，可解决全区人民全部生活的百分之八十。此外，治淮工程已部分开工，以工代赈更提供了战胜灾荒的保证。
    补种的晚秋虽然一般长的还好，但距收获期还远，切不要麻痹乐观。有些地区的虫灾尚须大力防治，最近天呈旱象，还须继续抗旱，以期胜利度过灾荒。
