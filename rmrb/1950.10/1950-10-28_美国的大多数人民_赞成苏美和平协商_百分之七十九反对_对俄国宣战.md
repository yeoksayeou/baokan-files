    [Xinhua News Agency, New York, 27th] TASS, New York, 26th: Public opinion polls show that the majority of American people support resolving the differences between the United States and the Soviet Union. The "American Institute of Public Opinion" asked a "majority of people" representing various different opinions in the United States whether they thought "the method of leaders from the Soviet and American governments meeting to try to resolve the differences between the two countries is a good idea."

    52% replied that they thought it was a good idea, 6% said "the method is not bad," 35% said "the method is not good," and 7% did not express an opinion on the question.

    To another question: "Do you think the United States should declare war on Russia now," only 13% gave an affirmative reply, 79% gave a negative reply to this insane "proposal," and 8% did not express an opinion.

    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社纽约二十六日讯：民意测验表明了美国大多数人民均赞成解决美苏之间的歧见。“美国民意研究所”曾询问代表美国各种不同舆论的“大多数人士”，他们认为“由苏美两国政府领袖会面试图解决两国之间的歧见这个办法究竟好不好”。
    百分之五十二答复说他们认为这是一个好办法，百分之六说“这个办法不坏”，百分之三十五说“这个办法不好”，百分之七对这个问题不表示意见。
    对于另一个问题：“你认为美国应当现在就对俄国宣战吗”，只有百分之十三作肯定的答复，百分之七十九对这疯狂的“主张”作否定的答复，百分之八不表示意见。
