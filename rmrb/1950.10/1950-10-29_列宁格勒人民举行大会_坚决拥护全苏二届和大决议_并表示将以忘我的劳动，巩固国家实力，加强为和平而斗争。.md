　　Xinhua News Agency, Leningrad, October 24th (TASS dispatch): Congresses are being held in Leningrad to review the achievements of the Second All-Soviet Peace Conference. Workers, scientists, and students unanimously support the resolutions of the conference and the mandates given to the Soviet delegates attending the Second World Peace Congress. While discussing the achievements of the All-Soviet Peace Conference, the people of Leningrad expressed their highest respect for the great standard-bearer of peace, Stalin.
　　At the general meeting of all employees of the Kirov Factory, the All-Soviet Peace Conference delegate, Stakhanovite milling machine worker Sevich, made a report, saying: We all remember the days when we were still working under the artillery defense lines when the factory was covered in frost and snow. Those days were very difficult, but we did not leave the factory because everyone knew he was working for victory and peace. In those difficult days, we were all encouraged by the great Stalin. Today, in our struggle for peace, we are also led by our beloved leader. We firmly believe that we will win in this struggle.
　　Foreman Kataisov spoke to the thousands of workers at the meeting. Like all other speakers at the meeting, he angrily condemned the atrocities of the American aggressors in Korea and spoke of the conspiracies of the war-mongers in West Germany. Kataisov stated: In order to build our happy new life, we need peace, and we dedicate all our energy to the cause of peace. All the workers in our factory are now participating in "Peace Work Teams." We will fight for peace in this way.
　　The congress unanimously passed a resolution stating: All employees of the Kirov Factory, who have received three medals, together with hundreds of millions of Soviet people, unanimously support Stalin's peaceful diplomatic policy. We warmly support the mandates given to the Soviet delegates attending the Second World Peace Congress. In order to safeguard world peace, we will use our Stakhanovite selfless labor to consolidate the strength of our motherland, and we will expand our contribution to the noble cause of the struggle for peace.
　　Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Stalin Prize winner Shatelain, in his speech at the congress held at the Kalinin Technical Institute, the largest industrial education institution in the country, stated: The Soviet people need peace and will fight for peace, which is the main theme of the speeches of the All-Soviet Peace Conference delegates. We very contemptuously denounce the criminal actions of the instigators of a new war because the great movement of peace advocates is under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the thinker of human genius.
　　The delegate to the All-Soviet Peace Conference, the famous cutting worker Musdukova, delivered a moving speech at the workers' congress of the "Kuaibu Shoe Factory," saying: We will dedicate all our energy to increasing the strength of the Soviet Union. We protest the American aggression in the East. We demand: No action in Korea! No action in Vietnam! No action in Taiwan! Soviet women and millions of working women around the world declare together: War is absolutely not allowed!

    【新华社讯】塔斯社列宁格勒二十四日电：列宁格勒各处举行大会，检讨第二届全苏拥护和平大会的成绩。工人、科学家和学生们，一致拥护大会的决议和给出席第二届世界和平大会的苏联代表们的委托书。列宁格勒人民讨论全苏和大的成绩时，表示他们对伟大的和平旗手斯大林的最高敬意。
    基洛夫工厂全体职工大会听取了全苏和大代表、斯塔哈诺夫式磨谷机工人赛维奇所作的报告，他说：我们都还记得我们工厂霜雪纷飞时我们仍在炮火防御体下面工作的日子。这些日子是很艰苦的，但我们没有离开工厂，因为每个人都知道他是为胜利与和平而工作。在那些艰苦的日子里，我们都被伟大的斯大林鼓舞着。今天在我们为和平而进行的斗争中，我们也是被我们自己所爱戴的领袖领导着的。我们坚决相信我们在这种斗争中必将获胜。
    领班卡泰索夫向大会的成千工人们演说。他和大会中其他一切演说者们一样，愤怒地谴责美国侵略者在朝鲜的暴行，并说到战争贩子们在西德的阴谋。卡泰索夫称：为要建设我们幸福的新生活，我们需要和平，我们把我们一切精力都献给和平事业。我们一切工厂的工人现在都参加了“和平工作班”。我们就用这种方式为和平而斗争。
    大会一致通过决议称：获得三次勋章的基洛夫工厂的全体职工，和苏联亿万人民一道，一致拥护斯大林和平外交政策。我们热烈拥护给与出席第二届世界和平大会的苏联代表们的委托书。我们为了世界和平而以我们斯塔哈诺夫式的忘我劳动，去巩固我们祖国的实力，我们将要扩大对为和平而斗争的崇高事业的贡献。
