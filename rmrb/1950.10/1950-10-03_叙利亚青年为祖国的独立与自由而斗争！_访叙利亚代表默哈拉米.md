　　"Syrian youth are fighting for their national independence and freedom!" Syrian Democratic Youth Representative Moharami told the reporter at the beginning. Then he described the struggle of the Syrian people and youth.
    The Syrian reactionary government has completely exposed itself as an anti-people group obeying Wall Street, colluding with imperialism and actively preparing for war. As a result, the Syrian people have suffered serious persecution and plunder. Imperialist commodities occupy the entire Syrian market, a large number of domestic factories have closed down, the number of unemployed workers has reached 60 to 70 percent of the total number of workers in the country, prices have soared, and the people have become increasingly impoverished. However, the Syrian people and youth have realized that this is a disaster brought to them by imperialism and its running dogs, and have begun to organize to fight. The Syrian Workers' Congress was established in 1946, the Democratic Women's Federation was established in 1947, and in 1949 the youth also established their own organizations -- the Syrian Democratic Youth League and the Syrian Student Union. These organizations, under the leadership of the Syrian Communist Party, have united all the people to fight against domestic and foreign reactionaries, and the Syrian youth stand at the forefront of the struggle. In July of this year, the Syrian people resisted the aggression of the three imperialist countries of the United States, Britain, and France, and launched a nationwide self-defense parade. The reactionary government dispatched a large number of military police to suppress it, and 150 young people were arrested, some of whom were injured and some were killed. Despite this, the Syrian people and youth did not yield, and the self-defense movement became more magnificent and powerful. In the peace signature campaign, although the reactionary government ordered a ban and arrested everyone who signed, at the end of July, 120,000 people still signed, and this number is constantly increasing.
    He told reporters that the victory of the Chinese people greatly encouraged the struggle of the Syrian youth and people, because they realized from this fact that the imperialists can be defeated. Therefore, Syrian youth are particularly concerned about every victory of the Chinese people, and many young people gather in streets or villages, waiting for news from China. The Syrian people and youth have realized that only by closely uniting with the Soviet Union, China and all peace-loving and democratic countries to defend world peace can they seek their own liberation.

　　叙利亚青年为祖国的独立与自由而斗争！
    ——访叙利亚代表默哈拉米
    “叙利亚青年正在为祖国的独立自由而斗争!”叙利亚民主青年代表默哈拉米一开始就对记者这样说。接着他叙述了叙利亚人民和青年斗争的情况。
    叙利亚反动政府已完全暴露出它是听命于华尔街的反人民的集团，他们和帝国主义勾结在一起，积极准备着战争。这结果使叙利亚人民遭受了严重的迫害与掠夺。帝国主义者的商品占据了叙利亚整个市场，国内工厂大批倒闭，失业工人已达全国工人数目的百分之六十至七十，物价飞涨，人民日益贫困。但是叙利亚的人民和青年已经认识了这是帝国主义及其走狗带给他们的灾难，开始组织起来进行斗争。一九四六年成立了叙利亚工人大会，一九四七年成立了民主妇女联合会，一九四九年青年们也建立了自己的组织——叙利亚民主青年联盟和叙利亚学生联合会。这些组织都在叙利亚共产党领导下团结了全体人民和国内外反动派进行斗争，叙利亚青年站在斗争的最前线。今年七月，叙利亚人民反抗美英法三国帝国主义的侵略，发动了全国性的自卫游行，反动政府曾经出动了大批军警进行弹压，有一百五十个青年被逮捕，其中有的负伤，有的被杀死。尽管如此，叙利亚人民和青年并没有屈服，自卫运动开展得更壮阔强大。在和平签名运动中，虽然反动政府下令禁止并逮捕每一个签名的人，但在七月底，仍然有十二万人签了名，而且这个数字正在不断的增加中。
    他告诉记者，中国人民的胜利大大的鼓舞了叙利亚青年和人民的斗争，因为他们从这个事实中认识到帝国主义者是可以打败的。因此叙利亚青年特别关心着中国人民每一次的胜利，很多青年聚集在街头或村庄，等待着来自中国的消息。叙利亚人民和青年认清了唯有紧紧地和苏联、中国及一切和平民主国家团结在一起保卫世界和平，才能求得自己的解放。
