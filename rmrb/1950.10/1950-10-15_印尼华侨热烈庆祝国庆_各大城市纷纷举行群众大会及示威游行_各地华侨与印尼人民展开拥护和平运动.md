    【新华社十三日讯】印尼华侨空前热烈庆祝祖国的第一个国庆节。印尼首都雅加达及泗水、日惹、三宝垄、万隆、棉兰、先达、巨港、孟加锡、楠榜、及婆罗洲的山口洋等地的华侨，都在国庆节前半个月左右就开始筹备庆祝，印尼各阶层的华侨在庆祝祖国的新生中，表现了空前的大团结。
    国庆之日，印尼各大城市的华侨都举行了群众大会和游行。我国驻印尼大使馆曾应邀派遣使馆人员到泗水、棉兰、孟加锡、万隆等地与华侨共庆佳节。
    在雅加达，有三万五千人参加了庆祝大会，情绪十分热烈。会上，当王任叔大使演说时华侨报以热烈的掌声。大会在宣读致毛主席的贺电时，与会者高呼“中华人民共和国万岁！”、“毛主席万岁！”、“华侨大团结万岁！”、“中、印友好万岁！”等口号。
    印尼各地华侨在热烈庆祝国庆节的同时，与印尼人民展开了广泛的拥护和平运动。雅加达的华侨在群众大会上，放起和平鸽子；在庆祝国庆期间已经征集了六万人的签名。日惹的华侨庆祝委员会与劳工会联合，于群众大会结束后在亚伦亚伦广场召开拥护世界和平大会。
    印尼人民参加庆祝新中国国庆节的热烈情况显示了中印两国人民的团结。在泗水的庆祝大会上，有印尼社会党、全印尼总工会泗水分会、印尼国民党及印尼民主青年等各党派各团体的代表六十余人参加。日惹的印尼人民革命阵线、印尼独立国民党等党派，及印尼总工会、印尼矿工联合会、印尼印刷工会联合会等七个工人团体，都派了代表参加当地华侨的庆祝大会。会上，印尼各党派各人民团体的代表都发表演说，祝贺中国人民的胜利，同时号召亚洲人民团结起来，为打倒帝国主义的殖民政策而斗争。在日惹参加火炬游行的二千人中，印尼人民占三分之一。
    印尼各地华侨在庆祝会后都举行了火炬游行或游园会。龙狮、腰鼓、秧歌舞得热火朝天，华侨住宅高悬国旗，张灯结采。泗水青年阵线提灯队的四角灯笼上张贴着“反对帝国主义破坏联合国宪章”的标语。泗水市民认为，这是空前未有的盛大场面。雅加达的华侨在游行中，把特备的花车装饰成了“解放号”的坦克，和田桂英的火车头，以此象征中国人民解放军的强大和祖国的经济建设。
    印尼东苏门答腊华侨群众庆祝大会、华侨总会、印尼三马林达中华总会，雅加达中印建交工作委员会，及雅加达百余华侨学校、报社、人民团体等纷纷致电毛主席及周外长，祝贺国庆，并表示坚决拥护周外长抗议美帝国主义侵略中国领土台湾及轰炸东北的严正声明。
