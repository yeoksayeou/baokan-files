　　Wen'an County, Hebei Province, Pays Attention to Overcoming Waste of Labor and Materials
　　Saving 300,000 Jin of Grain in Flood Control Expenditures
　　Flood Control Summaries from Various Regions Should Include Inspection of Material Usage
　　[This Newspaper Reports] Wen'an County, Hebei Province, implemented a strict expenditure system and careful budgeting, saving 300,000 jin of grain in expenditures during this year's flood control work.
　　The county's thousand-li dike section is over 170 *huali* long, making the flood control task arduous. At the beginning of flood control, there was a lack of thorough organization and in-depth mobilization of the civilian workers, leading to a hectic and chaotic situation when conditions became tense. The expenditure system was not strict, resulting in waste. The county leadership immediately paid attention to implementing a strict expenditure system, inspecting the appropriateness of materials used for the project, the number of civilian workers, and expenditure procedures, and also inspired the enthusiasm of the civilian workers, enabling them to complete certain projects on time or ahead of schedule, thereby saving on grain expenditures. During the inspection, any instances of falsely reported numbers of workers, inappropriate use of materials, or lax expenditure systems were promptly corrected, and those responsible were asked to conduct self-criticisms or were criticized, with warnings being communicated to the entire county. This avoided waste. The county leadership paid constant attention to careful budgeting and researched ways to save expenditures. For example, during the inventory of materials and reconciliation of accounts, it was discovered that many materials belonged to the public, saving 100,000 jin of grain in expenditures. In addition, civilian workers were mobilized in the Zhao Wang River to collect miscellaneous firewood for use as windbreak equipment, saving over 50,000 jin of reeds. The entire county saved a total of 300,000 jin of grain in expenditures during flood control. In addition, the used pile materials from various dike sections must be strictly protected to prevent theft and damage, laying the foundation for next year's flood control material preparation.

　　Editor's Note: In flood control work, various regions often experience a lot of waste in the use of materials due to the urgency of the task and the busyness of the work. Wen'an County's experience in paying attention to strict systems and saving grain expenditures during flood control is very good. In flood control summaries from various regions, whether there has been waste of materials should also be included as an item for summary and inspection.

　　河北文安县注意克服工料浪费
    节约防汛开支粮三十万斤
    各地防汛总结对物料使用应加检查
    【本报讯】河北文安县领导上严格开支制度，精打细算，在今年防汛工作中节省开支粮三十万斤。
    该县千里堤段全长一百七十余华里，防汛任务繁重。防汛开始时，民工缺乏周密的组织和深入的动员，致情况紧张时，手忙脚乱，开支制度不严，发生浪费现象。该县领导上当即注意严格开支制度，对工程使用物料是否适当，民工人数，和开支手续等进行检查，并启发民工的积极性，使其定期或提前完成一定的工程，因而节省了开支粮。在检查中，如发现虚报人数，工料使用不适当，开支制度不严等现象，即及时纠正，并令其检讨或提出批评，通报全县警惕，这样避免了浪费现象。该县领导上随时注意精打细算，研究节省开支的办法。如在清理物料查对账目中，发现有很多物料是公家的，节省开支粮十万斤。此外在赵王河发动民工捞杂柴做防风设备，省苇子五万余斤。全县在防汛中共节省开支粮三十万斤。此外，今后对各堤段已使用的桩料要严加保护，防止偷盗、破坏，打下明年防汛备料的基础。（李泽民、梁甲辰、任国华、李树成、陈子芳、刘化彬）
    编者按：各地在防汛工作中，常因任务紧迫，工作忙乱，致在物料使用上，发生不少的浪费现象。文安县在防汛中，注意严格制度、节约开支粮的经验是很好的。各地在防汛总结中，对物料是否有浪费，也应列入总结项目加以检查。
