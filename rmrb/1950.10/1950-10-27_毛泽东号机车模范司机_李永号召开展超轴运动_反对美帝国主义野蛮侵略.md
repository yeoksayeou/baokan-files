　　Mao Zedong Locomotive Model Driver
    Li Yong Calls for an Over-Axle Movement
    Opposing the Barbaric Aggression of U.S. Imperialism
    [Reported by this newspaper] Li Yong, the driver of the Mao Zedong locomotive, called on all railway employees to complete the year's production tasks ahead of schedule in 1950 and to oppose the aggression of U.S. imperialism. In his letter to all employees, he pointed out: "During the great production competition in May, June, and July of this year, many heroic models emerged and made great achievements. Therefore, I believe that comrades will work harder, faster, and better to complete this important task this time.
    The transportation department should use the method of transporting more goods to strive to complete the year's transportation tasks ahead of schedule. I call on comrades from all sub-bureaus and locomotive crews within the Tianjin Railway Bureau to launch an over-axle movement. I think that more transportation and faster running, mastering speed and stability, and ensuring no slow starts and slow entry into stations are good ways to eliminate accidents.
    Let us do a little calculation: If each locomotive overloads by 300 tons per one-way trip, it can overload by 600 tons in a round trip. If each locomotive crew runs 20 trips a month, the entire month can overload by 12,000 tons. According to the total number of locomotives in our entire bureau, we can save 900 locomotives per month (calculated by tonnage). If it takes seven tons of coal for a round trip from Tianjin to Fengtai, then 900 locomotives will burn 6,300 tons of coal, equivalent to 378,000 catties of millet. Comrades, this does not include labor and locomotive consumables. What an astonishing figure this is. Of course, the conditions of the lines and locomotives in various sections of the Tianjin Bureau are different, and it is impossible to require all of them to overload by 300 tons, but it is certain that overloading can complete transportation tasks ahead of schedule and save a lot of national resources. Let all our employees work hard to strive for 'over-axle'! Then how can we do a good job in the over-axle movement? First of all, administrative responsible comrades should formulate specific over-axle plans based on the locomotive status and the technical conditions of the crew. Second, strive for factory cooperation to improve locomotive quality, and crew comrades should improve operating skills and do a good job in antifreeze work. Third, superiors must go deep into the lower levels in a timely manner to understand the situation of each group and solve the difficulties of the locomotive groups in a timely manner. Only in this way can we give full play to the effectiveness of the locomotives and pull more traction. Comrades, work hard! In order to strive to complete the 1950 production tasks as soon as possible and oppose the aggression of U.S. imperialism, let us all work together!"

　　毛泽东号机车模范司机
    李永号召开展超轴运动     
    反对美帝国主义野蛮侵略
    【本报讯】毛泽东号机车司机李永，号召全体铁路员工提前完成一九五○年全年的生产任务，反对美帝国主义侵略。他给全体员工的信中指出：“在今年五、六、七月份生产大竞赛中，产生了很多英雄模范，做出了很大的成绩。所以我相信同志们这次会更加努力更快更好的完成这个重大的任务。
    运转部门要用多拉货物的办法，争取提前完成全年的运输任务。我号召我们天津局管内各分局各机车组的同志们展开超轴运动。我觉得多拉快跑，掌握快与稳，保证不运缓进站慢，是一个消灭事故的好法子。
    让我们算个小账：每一台机车，一个单程超轴三百吨，一个往复就能超轴六百吨。每个机车组一个月可以跑二十趟车计算，全月就可以超轴一万二千吨。按我们全管理局机车总数来说，一个月就可省机车九百台（均按吨数计算）。以天津至丰台一个往复需要烧煤七吨计算，九百台机车就要烧煤六千三百吨，折合小米三十七万八千斤，同志们这还不算人工和机车消耗材料等费用，这是一个多么惊人的数目字。当然，全天津局各段线路及机车状况不同，不能一律都要超轴三百吨，但超轴可以提前完成运输任务，可以为国家节省大量资财是肯定无疑的，让我们全体员工努力来争取‘超轴’！那末我们怎样来作好超轴运动呢？首先要行政负责同志根据机车状态及乘务员技术条件，订出具体的超轴计划。第二争取工厂配合提高机车质量，乘务员同志提高操纵技术做好防冻工作。第三、上级一定要及时深入下层，了解各组的情况，及时解决机车组的困难。这样才能发挥机车的效能才能多拉牵引。同志们努力吧！为争取早日完成一九五○年的生产任务，反对美帝国主义侵略，我们大家共同努力吧！”
