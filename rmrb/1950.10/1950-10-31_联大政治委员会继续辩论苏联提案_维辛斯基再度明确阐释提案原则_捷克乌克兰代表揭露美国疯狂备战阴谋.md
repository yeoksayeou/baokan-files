Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 30th: The United Nations General Assembly’s Political Committee continued its discussion of the Soviet proposal for a “Declaration on the Removal of the Threat of New War and the Consolidation of World Peace and Security” on the 26th, 27th, and 28th.

　　At the meeting on the 26th, Belarusian representative Kiselev, citing facts and documents, proved that the current international tension is entirely due to the U.S. government's embarking on a path of aggression and a path of frantic arms expansion. Kiselev contrasted the Soviet Union's peace policy with this aggressive policy of the United States. He called for the adoption of the Soviet proposal to make an effective effort to resolve current international disputes. He said: If the General Assembly adopts this proposal, it will reflect the will of hundreds of millions of people who yearn for lasting and stable peace.

　　At the meeting on the 27th, Czechoslovakian representative Široký pointed out that in the countries of the American bloc, especially in the United States, a frenzied arms race movement is underway, placing a heavy burden on the people. The adoption of the Soviet recommendations on the reduction of armaments and armed forces of the great powers would undoubtedly greatly reduce the current international tension and strengthen the authority of the United Nations. He also supported other recommendations contained in the Soviet proposal. Široký said that the Soviet Union's proposals to ensure peace are fully in line with the will of the vast majority of the world's people.

　　At the same meeting, Ukrainian representative Baranovsky said that the adoption of the Soviet proposal is of particular importance in the current international situation, because the governments of the United States and its satellite countries are pursuing a policy of force, which is manifested in the arms race and the implementation of a plan to transform the United States into a fully armed military state. The United States has established military bases in more than sixty countries and a batch of islands, and stationed troops in those places. Baranovsky sharply criticized the absurd argument of the United States and other countries' representatives that peace can only be achieved by intensifying the arms expansion, pointing out that this is a rehash of the old tune of all aggressors and invaders: "If you want peace, then prepare for war." Baranovsky said: We resolutely oppose this policy, because it will lead to dangerous disputes and cause serious conflicts. The Ukrainian delegation supports the recommendations in the Soviet proposal because it aims to enhance the responsibility of major powers to maintain peace and points out practical and feasible measures to achieve lasting peace.

　　American and British Warmongers Oppose the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons; Even Indicate They Will Vote Against the Soviet Proposal

　　At the meeting on the 26th, U.S. representative Austin mentioned the Stockholm Appeal with resentment, and expressed particular dissatisfaction with the passage in the appeal which suggested that governments that first use atomic weapons should be regarded as war criminals. He firmly opposed the various recommendations in the Soviet proposal.

　　At the same meeting, British representative Younger repeated the provocative slanders of warmongers against the Stockholm Appeal. He opposed the Soviet proposal to ban atomic weapons. In his view, the manufacture of other weapons, especially tanks, is no less dangerous than atomic weapons. He forgot the fact that the atomic bomb is a weapon of mass extermination of civilians. However, he also opposed reducing other types of armaments, rejected the Soviet proposal to reduce the armaments of the great powers by one-third, and regarded this proposal as an obstacle to further armament by the U.S.-British bloc. Younger indicated that he would vote against the Soviet proposal.

　　At the meeting on the 28th, Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky delivered another lengthy speech, summarizing the five days of discussion in the Political Committee. Vyshinsky first declared: Although some people in the Political Committee have tried their best to avoid talking about the Soviet proposal, this attempt has proved to be a failure. Moreover, because the Soviet Union took the initiative on this issue, many delegations were forced to follow this path and put forward their own proposals on this issue. The Bolivian representative had to admit that the main reason for putting forward his own proposal was fear of world public opinion and fear that opposing the Soviet proposal would arouse the anger of all anti-war mongers and peace-loving people. The submission of the six-power proposal was also influenced by the same motive.

　　When discussing the situation of the Soviet proposal, Vyshinsky pointed out: A characteristic of the speeches of those who oppose this proposal is that they slander the Soviet proposal and the entire Soviet foreign policy at the expense of distorting the facts. U.S. representative Austin has been particularly active in this regard.

　　New War Propaganda in the United States is Intensifying; the Soviet Union Must Carry Out Effective Struggle

　　Vyshinsky again clarified the important principles in the Soviet proposal and proved that the various criticisms raised by those who opposed the Soviet proposal were untenable. Those who opposed the Soviet recommendation on condemning the propaganda of new wars insisted that such a resolution had already been adopted in 1947. Vyshinsky pointed out that the Soviet recommendation this time is very different from the 1947 resolution. The Soviet government believes that it has a responsibility not to be bound by the resolution passed three years ago, but to once again put forward a proposal declaring its determination to conduct an effective and vigorous struggle against war instigators and war-mongering acts, and to conduct this struggle with more resolute methods than those stipulated in the 1947 resolution. Vyshinsky convincingly pointed out that in some countries, especially in the United States, the power of warmongers has not weakened at all, and the propaganda of new wars has not decreased at all, but has become more and more intense and has taken on forms that are more dangerous to peace.

　　Vyshinsky said to the representatives of the U.S.-British bloc who opposed the Soviet recommendation on banning atomic weapons: We doubt that you even want to ban atomic bombs.

　　Referring to those who criticized the Stockholm Appeal, Vyshinsky pointed out: It is obvious that these critics fantasize that they can reduce the great moral and political significance of this historical Stockholm Appeal, which has already been supported by hundreds of millions of people with their signatures. Vyshinsky wanted people to pay attention to the roars and attacks of certain delegations against the Stockholm Appeal, which proved the great power of this declaration and the extraordinarily great influence of peace advocates.

　　Vyshinsky convincingly refuted the argument of the U.S.-British bloc against the Soviet proposal to reduce the armaments of the five major powers by one-third. He said: Some people say that tanks are no less terrifying than atomic bombs, but when we proposed to reduce various armaments, including tanks, by one-third, some people opposed it again. This proves that the position of the U.S.-British bloc has completely gone bankrupt. Their representatives do not want to make any form of reduction in armaments and are unwilling to give up their arms race. Vyshinsky spoke in detail about the situation of the arms race in the U.S.-British bloc countries, the continuous increase in military expenditures, and the increase in the number of various armed forces in capitalist countries.

　　The Soviet Proposal for a Peace Pact is of Great Significance and Meets the Urgent Peace Demands of Tens of Millions of People

　　Vyshinsky finally pointed out that the Soviet proposal for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact is of special, significant social and political significance, and even more so from the point of view of establishing international trust, which some people have talked about at the meeting. Ordinary people would say: Indeed, no matter what differences exist between them, they have finally reached an agreement not to attack each other. Ordinary people would say: This means that we can live in peace every day, we can sleep peacefully, and we can raise our children in peace, because we know that these children will not become victims of atomic bombs.

　　During the three-day meeting, representatives from New Zealand, Sweden, Uruguay, France, Chile, Argentina, Cuba, Egypt, Mexico, the Netherlands and other countries spoke out against the Soviet proposal and supported the six-power proposal of the United States, Britain, etc. or the Bolivian proposal, which were used to oppose the Soviet proposal. The Bolivian representative finally withdrew his proposal and joined the six-power proposal as a proposing country.

　　Syrian representative El-Gouri supported part of the Soviet proposal, but he also agreed with the six-power proposal, but the section in it that said "inciting domestic conflict" constitutes "aggression" should be deleted. Indian representative Rau said that he supported the six-power proposal, but he also said that he would later propose amendments to the original text of each proposal.

　　The Political Committee is scheduled to continue its discussion of the Soviet proposal on the 30th.

　　联大政治委员会继续辩论苏联提案
    维辛斯基再度明确阐释提案原则
    捷克乌克兰代表揭露美国疯狂备战阴谋
    【新华社三十日讯】综合塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会十月二十六、二十七、二十八三日继续讨论苏联提出的“制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全宣言”案。
    在二十六日会议上，白俄罗斯代表基塞列夫发言，援引事实和文件，证明目前国际关系之所以紧张，完全是由于美国政府走上了侵略的道路，走上了疯狂扩充军备的道路。基塞列夫把苏联所遵循的和平政策，与美国这种侵略政策作了对比。他要求通过苏联提案，从而作一有效的努力来解决当前国际的纷争。他说：大会如果通过这一提案，就是反映了亿万渴望持久与稳固和平的人民的意志。
    在二十七日会议上，捷克斯洛伐克代表西罗基指出：在美国集团的国家中，特别是在美国，疯狂的备战运动正在进行，把沉重负担加在人民身上。通过苏联关于裁减大国军备与武装部队的建议，无疑会大大减少目前国际局势的紧张状态，同时亦将加强联合国的威信。他并支持苏联提案中所包含的其他建议。西罗基说，苏联提出的保证和平的各项建议充分符合世界绝大多数人民的意志。
    在同日会议上，乌克兰代表巴拉诺夫斯基说，通过苏联这一提案在目前的国际局势中特别具有重要的意义，因为目前美国及其仆从国家政府都在奉行武力政策，这种政策已表现在军备竞赛和实行变美国为全副武装的军事国家计划上。美国已在六十个以上国家及成批的岛屿建立军事基地，并且在那些地方驻扎军队。巴拉诺夫斯基尖锐地抨击美国及其他国家代表所称通过加紧扩军才能有和平的荒谬论调，指出这是重弹一切进犯者和侵略者的老调：“如果你要和平，那么就准备战争”。巴拉诺夫斯基说：我们断然反对这种政策，因为它会招致危险的纠纷并且引起严重的冲突。乌克兰代表团支持苏联提案中的各项建议，因为它旨在增强大国维持和平的责任，并且指出了获致持久和平的切实可行的措施。
    美英战贩反对禁用原子武器  竟表示要投票反对苏联提案
    在二十六日会议上，美国代表奥斯汀以恼恨的心情提到斯德哥尔摩宣言，对宣言中建议把首先使用原子武器的政府视为战争罪犯的那一段表示特别的不满。他断然反对苏联提案中的各项建议。
    在同日会议上英国代表杨格重复战争贩子们对斯德哥尔摩宣言挑拨性的谰调。他反对苏联提案中禁止原子武器的建议。在他看来，其他武器的制造，尤其是坦克，并不比原子武器更少危险性。他忘记了这个事实，即原子弹乃是一种大规模灭绝平民的武器。但是，他也反对裁减其他型式的军备，拒绝苏联提案中裁减大国军备三分之一的建议，而把这个建议视为美英集团进一步武装的障碍。杨格表示将投票反对苏联提案。
    在二十八日会议上，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基再度发表长篇演说，综论政治委员会五天的讨论。维辛斯基首先宣称：虽然政治委员会某一部分人士竭力想避而不谈苏联的提案，但是这个企图证明已经失败了。而且由于苏联在这个问题上采取主动，好些代表团被迫顺着这条路走，并在这个问题上提出它们自己的提案。玻利维亚代表不得不承认提出他自己的提案的主要原因是惧怕世界舆论，惧怕反对苏联提案会引起所有反对战争贩子、爱好和平的人们的愤怒。六国提案的提出也是受到同样的动机的影响。
    维辛斯基在论及苏联提案的讨论情况时指出：反对这个提案的人的演说有一个特点，就是不惜以歪曲事实来诽谤苏联提案，诽谤整个苏维埃外交政策。在这方面做得特别卖力的就是美国代表奥斯汀。
    美国内新战争宣传日趋激烈  苏联必须进行有实效的斗争
    维辛斯基再度明确说明苏联提案中的各项重要原则，并证明反对苏联提案的人所提出的各种批评都是站不住脚的。反对苏联关于谴责新战争宣传的建议的人们硬说这样的决议已在一九四七年通过了。维辛斯基指出：苏联这次的建议和一九四七年的决议有大不相同之处。苏联政府认为它有责任不受三年前通过的决议的约束，而是要再次提出提案，宣告决心与战争挑拨者和贩卖战争的行为进行有实效的有力斗争，要用比一九四七年决议中的规定的更加坚决的办法来进行这个斗争。维辛斯基令人信服地指出，在有些国家里，首先在美国，战争贩子的力量不但一点也没有在减弱，新战争的宣传不但一点也不减少，反而越来越激烈，并且采取了对和平更有危险的形式。
    维辛斯基对反对苏联提案中禁止原子武器的建议的美英集团代表说：我们怀疑你们甚至连想也不想要禁用原子弹。
    维辛斯基在提到批评斯德哥尔摩宣言的人们时指出：很明显，这些批评的人幻想着他们能够减低这个历史性的已有数亿人民签名支持的斯德哥尔摩宣言的巨大的道义上和政治上的意义。维辛斯基要人们注意某些代表团对斯德哥尔摩宣言的咆哮和攻击，正证明了这个宣言的巨大力量和和平拥护者异常巨大的影响。
    维辛斯基令人信服地驳斥了美英集团反对苏联建议裁减五大国军备三分之一的论调。他说：有人说，坦克之可怖并不下于原子弹，但是当我们建议裁减包括坦克在内的各种军备三分之一的时候，却又有人反对它了。这证明美英集团的立场已彻头彻尾地破产。它们的代表们并不想作任何方式的裁减军备，并不愿意放弃他们的军备竞赛。维辛斯基详尽地谈到美英集团国家中军备竞争的情形，谈到军费之不断增加，以及资本主义国家中各种武装部队数量上的增加。
    苏联建议和平公约意义重大  符合千万人民迫切和平要求
    维辛斯基最后指出：苏联建议五强缔结和平公约是有特殊重大的社会和政治意义的，从会上有人谈到的建立国际信任的观点来看，更其是如此。普通的老百姓会说：的确，不管它们之间存在着什么分歧，他们终于还是达到了一个彼此互不进攻的协定。普通的老百姓会说：这意味着我们能每天在和平中生活，我们能太太平平地睡觉，我们能在和平中抚养我们的子女，因为我们知道这些儿童不会成为原子弹的牺牲品。
    在三天的会议中，有新西兰、瑞典、乌拉圭、法国、智利、阿根廷、古巴、埃及、墨西哥、荷兰等国代表发言反对苏联的提案，而支持用以反对苏联提案的美英等六国提案或玻利维亚提案。玻利维亚代表最后已撤回其提案，而加入六国提案提案国。
    叙利亚代表埃尔——古里支持苏联提案的一部分，但他又同意六国提案，不过对其中所说因为“煽动国内冲突”而构成“侵略”一节应予删除。印度代表劳氏表示支持六国提案，但他又说将在以后对各提案的原文提出修改。
    政治委员会定于三十日继续讨论苏联提案。
