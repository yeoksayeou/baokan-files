Xinhua News Agency, 26th dispatch: According to a Telepress dispatch from Calcutta: The United States government signed a "Bilateral Agreement on US-Burma Economic Cooperation" with the Burmese government in Rangoon on September 13. The officially announced agreement stipulates that the United States will allocate 8 to 10 million US dollars from the Marshall Plan funds to Burma. The secret clauses of the agreement stipulate that the United States will grant Burma loans of 35 million US dollars, and the United States will obtain the monopoly right to conduct geological surveys and unrestricted exploitation of oil mines in the middle and lower reaches of the Irrawaddy River (this area was until recently the monopoly scope of the British "Burma Oil Company"). The United States can obtain the right to develop non-ferrous metal deposits, especially tungsten, copper, lead and other minerals in Tavoy, Mergui, and Bawdwin through a "US-Burma Joint Venture Company".

In military terms, according to this agreement, the United States will be able to establish Rangoon as a naval port; Americans have the right to build railways, highways, and airports capable of accommodating the heaviest bombers in Burma.

Xinhua News Agency, 25th dispatch: TASS dispatch from The Hague, citing Jakarta news: US imperialism is trying its best to Marshallize Indonesia. Antara News Agency reported: The agreement on American economic "aid" to Indonesia was signed on October 16 in Jakarta by the US Ambassador to Indonesia, Cochran, and the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Roem. This agreement is based on the report of the American economic mission headed by Griffin, which visited Indonesia in April this year. The agreement stipulates that the United States will make huge investments in all economic sectors of Indonesia. In fact, the United States is attempting to turn the entire Indonesia into an appendage of American monopoly capital.

Xinhua News Agency, 25th dispatch: TASS dispatch from The Hague: According to the Dutch Communist newspaper De Waarheid: Negotiations on military issues between the United States and Indonesia are continuing. The US representative suggested giving Indonesia military "aid" and insisted that the United States establish a permanent military mission in Jakarta. The newspaper emphasized: In other words, the United States is trying to subordinate the Indonesian army to the US Supreme Command. The newspaper further pointed out: An Indonesian delegation led by Colonel Adam has gone to the United States to negotiate US "technical assistance" in establishing an "Indonesian Navy." During the initial negotiations, the United States has agreed to provide this "assistance."

　　美帝与缅甸印尼签订侵略性协定
    将在缅境建筑铁路机场和军港
    力图使印尼军队隶属美统帅部
    【新华社二十六日讯】据电通社加尔各答消息：美国政府于九月十三日与缅甸政府在仰光签订了一项《美缅经济合作双边协定》。官方宣布的协定中规定，美国从马歇尔计划款项中拨出八百万至一千万美元给缅甸。该项协定的秘密条款则规定美国给予缅甸贷款三千五百万美元，美国取得进行地质调查和不受限制地开发伊洛瓦底江中游和下游的油矿的垄断权（这个地区直到最近还是英国的“缅甸油公司”垄断的范围）。美国可以通过“美缅合营公司”取得开发非铁金属矿藏的权利，特别是塔伐、丹荖、薄漳等地的钨、铜、铅等矿。
    在军事方面，按照这项协定，美国得将仰光建立为军港；美国人有权在缅甸建筑铁路、公路，及能够容纳最重型轰炸机的飞机场。
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社海牙电引雅加达消息：美帝国主义者正极力使印尼马歇尔化。安普通讯社报道：美国对印尼经济“援助”的协定，已于十月十六日由美国驻印尼大使柯契伦与印尼外长罗姆在雅加达签订。这个协定系根据今年四月访问印尼、以葛里芬为首的美国经济使团的报告而订立的。这个协定规定美国对印尼一切经济部门作巨额投资。实际上，美国企图把整个印尼变为美国垄断资本的附属品。
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社海牙讯：据荷共真理报称：美国和印尼间关于军事问题的谈判在继续中。美国代表建议给印尼以军事“援助”，并坚持美国在雅加达设立常驻军事使团。该报着重指出：换句话说，美国正力图使印尼军队隶属美国最高统帅部。该报进一步指出：由阿达姆上校率领的印尼代表团已赴美，谈判美国在建立“印尼海军”中给予“技术援助”的事宜。在初步谈判期间，美国已答应给予这种“援助”。
