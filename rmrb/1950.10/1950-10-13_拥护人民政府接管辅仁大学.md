　　Endorsing the People's Government's Takeover of Fu Jen Catholic University
    Beijing Private Fu Jen Catholic University was taken over yesterday by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government. Fu Jen Catholic University has recently been threatened by imperialist elements. In order to safeguard the nation's educational sovereignty and the interests of all teachers, students, and staff of the school, our People's Government has taken this necessary measure. This measure has been endorsed by all teachers, students, and staff of the school, including Catholics.
    In the year since liberation, under the leadership of the People's Government and with the joint efforts of all teachers, students, and staff, the educational work of Fu Jen Catholic University has progressed. Certain foreigners in the Catholic Church at Fu Jen Catholic University are jealous of these advances and are trying to obstruct them. In order to achieve the goal of manipulating the school's administration, they illegally demanded the right to veto school personnel matters and insisted on dismissing five professors. After these demands were rejected by the school's president, they threatened to stop subsidies, putting the school into a state of chaos. These facts prove that these foreigners' intention is not to run education, nor to run legitimate religious affairs, but to use these as tools to invade China's educational sovereignty. Since the facts are as such, it is only natural that the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government takes over the school to prevent thousands of teachers, students, and staff from losing their schooling and jobs, after the foreign church organization has brazenly announced and implemented the suspension of funding.
    The government's handling of the Fu Jen Catholic University incident is obviously unrelated to the legitimate activities of the Catholic Church. The People's Government's policy of guaranteeing freedom of religious belief for the people is consistent and clear, and the policy of guaranteeing freedom of religious belief for teachers, students, and staff in any school is also consistent and clear. However, the People's Government will never tolerate anyone interfering with and disrupting the school's educational administration by using the power of the church. Certain foreigners in the Catholic Church at Fu Jen Catholic University demanded the dismissal of five professors and demanded the right to veto all personnel matters of the school thereafter, attempting to use the power of the church to manipulate the school's administration and teaching. This not only violates the education policies and laws of the People's Government, but also directly interferes with the freedom of belief of professors and students. Such destruction and interference should, of course, not be allowed.
    Fu Jen Catholic University is now starting its new history under the direct leadership of the People's Government. The Ministry of Education has announced that after the takeover, the religious beliefs of teachers, students, and staff at Fu Jen Catholic University will continue to be protected by the government and the school, as in the past. We believe that all teachers, students, and staff at Fu Jen Catholic University will be able to embark on a path of sound development and achieve greater progress from now on.

### 拥护人民政府接管辅仁大学

　　拥护人民政府接管辅仁大学
    北京私立辅仁大学已于昨日由中央人民政府教育部接管了。辅仁大学在最近遭受帝国主义分子的威胁，我人民政府为维护国家的教育主权和该校全体师生员工的利益，因而采取了这一项必要的措施。这一措施，得到了包括天主教徒在内的该校全体师生员工的拥护。
    解放一年以来，在人民政府的领导和全体师生员工的共同努力下，辅仁大学的教育工作是有进步的。对于这些进步，辅仁大学天主教会中的某些外国人却加以嫉视，并力图加以阻挠。他们为了达到操纵学校行政的目的，非法地要求对学校人事的否决权，并坚持解聘五位教授。在这些要求被该校校长拒绝以后，竟以停发补助费相威胁，而使学校陷入混乱状态。这些事实证明了这些外国人的本意并不在办理教育，也不在办理正当的宗教事业，而只是以这些为工具来侵略中国的教育主权。事实既然如此，那么，在外国教会组织已经悍然宣布并实行停发经费以后，中央人民政府教育部加以接管，以免数千师生员工的失学失业，自然是必要的了。
    政府对于辅仁大学事件的处理，显然与天主教的正当活动无关。人民政府保障人民宗教信仰自由的政策是一贯的和明确的，保障任何学校中师生员工的宗教信仰自由的政策也是一贯的和明确的。但是人民政府决不因此而容忍任何人借教会的权力干涉和扰乱学校教育行政。辅仁大学天主教会中某些外国人要求解聘五位教授并要求此后对于学校一切用人的否决权，企图使教会的权力操纵学校行政与教学，这就不但破坏了人民政府的教育政策法令，而且也是对教授学生信仰自由的直接干涉了。这种破坏和干涉，当然是不应该容许的。
    辅仁大学现在在人民政府的直接领导下开始它的新的历史了。教育部已经宣布，在接管以后，辅仁大学师生员工中的宗教信仰，将仍如过去一样受到政府和学校的保障。我们相信，辅仁大学的全体师生员工必能从此走上健全发展的道路，并得到更大的进步。
