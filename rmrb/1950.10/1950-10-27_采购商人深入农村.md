　　Purchasing Merchants Deepen into Rural Areas
    Our Correspondent Jin Yu
    After the autumn harvest, grain and medicinal herb merchants from Beijing, Tianjin and other places have successively arrived in Datong on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway line. With the brisk exchange of goods between urban and rural areas in Datong market, more and more merchants are arriving, the amount of grain entering the market is increasing steadily, and the amount leaving the area is increasing daily. The number of grain stores serving merchants from other places has increased from six to twenty-one, and state-owned specialized companies are trying out chain business methods to supply industrial products, daily necessities, and purchase grain and local products.

    Merchants from other places arrive in Datong one after another
    Datong is one of the grain distribution centers on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway line. Every year after the autumn harvest, many merchants from other areas go there to purchase grain. Also, because the city is close to the southern mountains, which are rich in medicinal materials such as astragalus, licorice, and winter flower, Chinese medicine merchants from Tianjin and other places also go there to purchase around the time of the Frost's Descent solar term in the lunar calendar. This year, thanks to stable prices, smooth transportation, and the help and impetus of state-owned trading organizations, the number of grain merchants going to Datong for purchases began to increase in mid-September.

    A new atmosphere appears in the market
    As the number of grain purchasing merchants increased, the market underwent great changes. The amount of grain entering the market increased steadily. In early September, the daily amount of grain entering the market was 400 to 500 *shi* (石, a unit of dry measure, approx. 100 liters); in early October, it was 700 to 800 *shi*; and by October 14, it had increased to more than 1,700 *shi*, more than double the amount in early October. The amount of grain leaving the area also gradually increased. Taking the amount transported to Beijing, Tianjin and other places as an example, the average daily amount was more than 180 *shi* around October 1, more than 770 *shi* around October 10, and by October 14, the export volume had reached 832 *shi* and 8 *dou* (斗, a unit of dry measure, approx. 10 liters).

    Bringing goods to the countryside has become the business direction of local merchants
    After the arrival of merchants from other places, local merchants in Datong also began to go to the mountains to purchase or bring goods to the countryside to exchange for agricultural products and by-products. Five Chinese medicine stores in Datong have sent people to Hunyuan, Daiyue, Yingxian and other places to purchase winter flower, astragalus, etc. Seven industries, including grain stores, silk and cloth, department stores, groceries, copperware, sand turning, and used clothing, also held meetings to study specific methods of bringing goods to the countryside, and prepared to supply farmers with urgently needed items such as iron pots and old cotton wadded covers.

    Bringing goods to the countryside is gradually becoming the business direction of Datong merchants. Taking the twelve counties in Yanbei as an example, there are more than 4,000 villages and a population of about 1.4 million in the whole area. And what about market towns? Including Datong, there are only twenty-one, with an average of one market town for every two hundred villages to carry out material exchanges. Some villages are seventy or eighty *li* (里, a unit of distance, approx. 500 meters) away from the market towns. Although there are supply and marketing cooperative organizations in between, they cannot meet the objective needs in the short term. It is easy to imagine how eagerly the vast number of peasants long for merchants to bring goods to the countryside.

    Merchants who go to the countryside are very popular among farmers
    Merchants who bring goods to the countryside are very popular among farmers and do not have to worry about not having business. Fan Zhentang, the manager of Renji Grocery and Cloth Store in Datong City, with the help and encouragement of the Datong City Administration for Industry and Commerce and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, took goods to the Jiuyu area for trade on September 29. Because he successfully completed his sales and exchange plan in the countryside, he was very happy. In his first letter to the Federation of Industry and Commerce, he talked about the situation after going to the countryside: "...We departed on the 29th and arrived at Jiuyu Old Station Village on the 30th. There are more than 80 households in the village, and we started exchanging goods here. According to my observation and conversation with the village chief, I know that there is no need to worry about security. As for the exchange work, it is also going smoothly with the help of the village chief and cadres. In this small village, we have already made about 9 million yuan worth of transactions early this morning. According to the goods we brought, it is possible to sell them all within five days." Fan Zhentang sent a second letter on the 16th, which said: "...Unexpectedly, the exchange work was very satisfactory to the farmers. After doing 1.5 million yuan worth of business in Old Station Village, we planned to go to Wangzhuang. When we arrived at Hetou Village, we were kept by the villagers for two days. Villagers from nearby villages also came one after another after hearing the news. In less than three days, we did nearly 3 million yuan worth of business..." In addition, he also talked about the harvest situation in the Jiuyu area and requested the government to lend him some money or purchase the miscellaneous grains he collected in the countryside when he went to the countryside for the second time.

    Government organization, leadership and assistance
    The Datong Municipal People's Government and state-owned specialized companies provided timely leadership and cooperation during the peak season of urban and rural material exchange.

    The Administration for Industry and Commerce, the Taxation Bureau, the bank and other units convened a symposium of seven industries on the 13th. Everyone realized that bringing goods to the countryside is the business direction of local merchants. Under the supervision of the local government, private industrial and commercial households organized an industrial and commercial inspection group, which is scheduled to go to Hunyuan, Daiyue and other places in the second half of this month to investigate trade conditions.

    In order to facilitate grain purchasing merchants and reduce intermediate costs, the Administration for Industry and Commerce once negotiated with the three industries of purchasing agencies, transit stations, and grain stores to reorganize them into grain stores that also operate transit and purchasing agency businesses. Before the reorganization, purchasing merchants had to pay the purchasing agency a commission of 2% and the transit station a transit fee of 0.666%. Calculated on the basis of a train carload of black beans worth 30 million yuan, the commission was 600,000 yuan and the transit fee was 200,000 yuan. After the reorganization, the total commission and transit fee is 1.833%. Calculated on the basis of a train carload of black beans, the fee is 549,000 yuan, a reduction of 0.833%. At a symposium held by the Administration for Industry and Commerce with grain merchants from Beijing, Tianjin and other places on October 13, the merchants unanimously expressed their satisfaction with the government's permission for them to purchase freely and reduce the cost of entrusting grain stores to purchase on their behalf.

    In order to encourage urban shopkeepers to bring goods to the countryside and promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, the Taxation Bureau also stipulated that urban shopkeepers can bring goods to the countryside with a certificate issued by the tax bureau, and the exchange of agricultural products will not be taxed as traveling merchants.

    The important regulation of the market by state-owned trading companies
    State-owned specialized companies such as department stores, cotton yarn and cloth, petroleum, and salt industry supplied a large number of industrial products and daily necessities along with the purchase of grain and local products, which timely recovered currency. In the twenty days from late September to early October, Datong's specialized companies sold department stores worth more than 616 million yuan, cotton cloth worth more than 726 million yuan, and edible salt worth more than 454 million yuan. Among them, the sales volume of the cotton yarn and cloth company and the salt industry company in early October increased sharply compared with late September. The cotton yarn and cloth company increased by nearly double, and the salt industry company increased by about 40%.

    The state-owned grain and local product companies also carried out purchases flexibly according to market supply and demand. Timely supply of industrial products by state-owned trading companies and flexible purchases of local products played an important regulatory role in the Datong market.

    This is how the circulation of commodities between urban and rural areas is promoted
    The exchange of goods between urban and rural areas with Datong as a distribution center is linked to rural areas and large cities by a long chain composed of state-owned trading companies, merchants from other places, local merchants, and rural peddlers. Agricultural products and by-products from the vast area of Yanbei are transported out of the countryside through it; industrial products and daily necessities produced in large cities are transported to the countryside through it. The purchasing power of farmers has increased, and the market for industrial products has also expanded.

　　采购商人深入农村
    本报记者  近宇
    秋收之后，京津等地粮食、药材商人陆续到达京绥线上的大同。大同市场上随着城乡物资交流的畅旺，客商越来越多，粮食上市量步步上升，出境量随之日增，服务外地客商的粮店由六家增至二十一家，各国营专业公司试行连环业务办法来供应工业品、日用必需品和收购粮食与土产。
    外地客商陆续到达大同
    大同市是京绥线粮食集散地之一，每逢秋收之后，都有很多外帮粮商前往采购；又因该市靠近盛产黄芪、甘草、冬花等药材的南山，天津等地国药商人也在阴历霜降前后陆续前往采购。今年在物价稳定，交通顺畅和国营贸易机构帮助和带动下，前往大同采购的粮商，自九月中旬即开始增加。
    市场出现了新的气象
    由于采购粮商日渐增多，市场起了很大变化。粮食上市量步步上升，九月初每日上市的粮食是四、五百石，十月初七、八百石，至十月十四日增至一千七百余石，比十月初增加了一倍以上。粮食出境量也是逐渐增加的，以运往京津等地的来说，在十月一日前后平均每天有一百八十余石，十月十日前后平均每天七百七十多石，至十月十四日输出量已达八百三十二石八斗。
    带货下乡已成本地商人经营的方向
    大同的本地商人在外地客商到来后，也开始上山采购或带货下乡交换农产品和农副产品。大同国药店已有五家派人到浑源、岱岳、应县等地采购冬花、黄芪等。粮店、绸布、百货、杂货、铜器、翻沙、估衣等七个行业也开会研究了如何带货下乡的具体办法，准备用铁锅、旧棉套等供应农民的急需。
    带货下乡逐渐成为大同商人的经营方向。以雁北十二个县来说，全县有四千多个村庄，有一百四十万左右的人口；集镇呢？连大同算上才有二十一个，平均每二百个村庄靠着一个集镇进行物资交换。有的村庄远离集镇七、八十里。其间虽有供销合作社的组织，但短期内是不能满足客观需要的。广大的农民是怎样渴望带货下乡的商人是可以想像的。
    下乡的商人大受农民的欢迎
    商人带货下乡大受农民欢迎，不愁没生意做。大同市仁记杂货布店的经理樊振堂，在大同市工商局、工商联合会的帮助鼓励下，九月二十九日带货到九区一带贸易。因为他在乡间顺利地完成推销、交换计划，所以非常高兴。他给工商联合会的第一封信里谈到下乡后的情形说：“……二十九日出发，三十日到达九区旧站村，该村有八十余户，我们就在此开始交换货物。据我观察并与村长交谈，知道治安无须忧虑。至于交换工作，有村长和干部帮忙也很顺利。在这个小村，今天一清早就成交了约九十万元的买卖。按我们所带的货品，可能在五日内全部售完。”樊振堂在十六日又来了第二封信，信里说：“……未料交换工作深得农民满意，在旧站村共做了一百五十万元的生意后，计划去王庄，走至河头村竟被乡民留住二日，附近各村乡民闻讯亦陆续前来，不到三日又做了近三百万元的生意……”此外他还谈到九区一带收成情形，并请求政府在他二次下乡时贷些款给他或是收购他在乡间收购的杂粮。
    政府的组织领导和协助
    大同市人民政府和各国营专业公司在城乡物资交流旺季里，进行了适时的领导和配合。
    工商局、税务局、银行等单位在十三日召集了七个行业的座谈会，大家认识到带货下乡是本地商人经营的方向。在当地政府督促下，私营工商户组织工商考察团，预定在本月下旬深入到浑源、岱岳等地考察贸易情况。
    工商局为了便利粮食采购商和减轻中间费用，曾和代购店、转运栈、粮店三个行业协商一律改组为兼营转运、代购的粮店。在未改组前，采购商要付代购店百分之二的佣金和付转运栈百分之点六六六的转运费。以一个车皮的黑豆总值三千万元计算，要付出佣金六十万元，转运费二十万元。在改组后，代购佣金和转运费共为百分之一点八三三，也以一车皮黑豆计算，所付费用是五十四万九千元，减少了百分之点八三三。在十月十三日工商局邀集京津等地粮商举行座谈会时，商人们对政府准许他们自由采购和减低委托粮店代购费用一致认为满意。
    税务局为了鼓励城内座商带货下乡，促进城乡物资交流，也规定了座商带货下乡可以由税局开具证明，交换农产品不另按行商征税。
    国营贸易公司对市场的重要调节
    国营百货、花纱布、石油、盐业等专业公司伴随着收购粮食和土产，供给了大量的工业品、日用必需品，适时的使货币回笼。在九月下旬至十月上旬的二十天中，大同各专业公司售出了总值六亿一千六百余万元的百货、总值七亿二千六百余万元的棉布、四亿五千四百余万元的食盐，其中花纱布和盐业两公司十月份上旬售货额均较九月下旬骤增，花纱布公司增加近倍，盐业公司增加约百分之四十。
    国营粮食、土产两公司也根据市场的供求情况，机动的进行收购。国营贸易公司及时供应工业品和机动进行收购土产，对大同市场起了重要的调节作用。
    就这样促进了城乡商品的流转
    以大同为集散地的城乡物资交换，是由国营贸易公司、外地客商、本地商人以及乡贩构成的一条长的纽带来联系着农村和大城市。雁北广大地区的农产品、农副产品通过它运出农村；大城市生产的工业品、日用必需品又通过它输向农村。农民的购买力提高了，工业品的市场也扩大了。
