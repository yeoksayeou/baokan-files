Xinhua News Agency, Paris, October 20th, TASS dispatch: Parisian evening newspapers reported on October 19th that the forces of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have advanced to the outskirts of Lang Son, an important town north of Hanoi. *Le Monde* admits that the French Expeditionary Force is retreating from this area towards the coast. The newspaper states that France will soon withdraw from the last few strongholds north of Hanoi (North Vietnam).

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, October 20th: In the past two months, the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army has continued its offensive against French forces in the Red River Delta region. The Vietnamese People's Liberation Army victoriously destroyed six enemy positions on August 16th, September 12th, and the second half of September. These positions are: Vu Hai and Lam Gu in Quang Yen province, and Gao Hai, Ke Rao, Jin Bai, and Dong Li (all three transliterated) in Thai Binh province.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Vietnam News Agency dispatch: The General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army issued a communique on the 18th, stating that the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army had wiped out a French paratrooper unit and liberated the French stronghold of Na Cham, 30 kilometers northwest of Lang Son, between October 11th and 13th. The communique then reported on the Battle of That Khe - Na Cham, stating:

On the evening of October 11th, the People's Liberation Army forces wiped out more than 500 of the over 1,000 French troops and mercenaries retreating southeast from Dong Khe, 45 kilometers southeast of Cao Bang. The French forces in Na Cham hastily retreated from Na Cham. A French paratrooper battalion of approximately 400 men, tasked with covering the French retreat towards Lang Son, was completely annihilated by the People's Liberation Army forces on October 11th. Two hundred and forty enemy soldiers and a French captain commanding the paratrooper battalion were captured.

The People's Liberation Army forces recaptured Na Cham on October 13th. On the same day, a remnant of the French army, unaware that Na Cham had been recaptured, entered the area and was immediately captured. Hundreds of remnants of the French army from the Lai Baisi and Xia'ertong units, starving in the woods for nearly a week, surrendered to the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army in groups and even entire platoons from October 11th to October 12th, following the liberation of That Khe.

According to the latest news: In the recent battles from Cao Bang to Na Cham, the People's Liberation Army captured a total of nearly 3,000 French soldiers and seized 65 vehicles. The majority of the weapons and ammunition seized from the French army were American-made, including several original heavy artillery pieces.

The communique also stated that fighting is currently taking place between Dong Dang, Lang Son, and Loc Binh, east of Lang Son.

　　越南人民解放军攻抵谅山城下红河三角洲地区同时发动进攻
    那岑战役中法军伞兵一营完全被歼
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十日讯：巴黎的晚报十月十九日报道称：越南民主共和国的部队已进抵东京北部重镇谅山的城下。《世界报》承认法国远征军正从这个区域向海岸退却。该报称：法国很快会自东京（北越）北部的最后几个据点撤退。
    【新华社讯】越南通讯社北越二十日电：过去两月中，越南人民解放军继续进攻红河三角洲地区的法军。越南人民解放军在八月十六日、九月十二日和九月下半月，胜利地摧毁了敌军六座阵地。这些阵地是：广安省的武海和蓝古，太平省的高海、科饶、金拜和东利（以上三地均译音）。
    【新华社二十一日讯】越南通讯社讯：越南人民解放军总部十八日发表公报称：越南人民解放军在十月十一日到十三日期间，肃清了法军的一支伞兵部队，解放了谅山西北三十公里的法军据点那岑城。公报继即报道七溪——那岑之战称：
    人民解放军部队于十月十一日晚上肃清了自高平东南四十五公里的东溪向东南溃退的千余名的法国军队与雇佣兵中的五百多人。那岑的法军即匆匆自那岑撤退。负有使命掩护法军向谅山撤退的法国伞兵一个营约四百人，十月十一日完全被人民解放军部队歼灭。敌军二百四十人与指挥这个伞兵营的法军上尉一名均被俘。
    人民解放军部队于十月十三日收复那岑。同日，法军残部一股因未悉那岑已被收复，进入这个地区，随即被俘。在树林中挨饿几近一个星期的赖巴西和夏尔同部队的法军残部数百名，从解放七溪的十月十一日到十月十二日，一班一班地、甚至整排整排地纷纷向越南人民解放军投降。
    据最后消息：从高平到那岑的最近几次战斗中，人民解放军俘获法军总共近三千名，缴获汽车六十五辆。从法军手中缴获的武器与军火，大部为美国造。其中有原装的重炮数门。
    公报又称：战斗现正在同登、谅山和谅山以东的录平之间进行中。
