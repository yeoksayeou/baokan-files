The Growth of the Divine Gunner Bai Bingwu
    Li Wen

Bai Bingwu attended the National Combat Heroes Conference with the honor of being a "Divine Gunner." He was twice elected as the "First-Class Model Marksman" of the entire artillery brigade. His squad won the "Technically the Best in the Army" award banner, and his company was known as the "Divine Gun Sixth Company." In the battles of Qingfengdian, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, and Lanzhou, which spanned North China and the Northwest, his artillery shell hit rate accounted for 95% of the total.

This "Divine Gunner," just five years ago, was still an ordinary worker in the Fushun Coal Mine. When he first joined the army in the autumn of 1945, he was frightened by the sight of wounded soldiers. He had only been in the artillery platoon for a short three years. How did a miner master the technology of heavy weapons? The process of Bai Bingwu's growth is also a silhouette of the People's Liberation Army growing from small to large and becoming stronger.

The Time to Avenge Has Come

Bai Bingwu is from Xingbin County, Liaodong Province. He had no land or house since he was a child. His parents died early, and he grew up with his older brother and sister-in-law. Because he fought with the landlord's child, he was severely beaten. He ran away and wandered to Fushun to beg for food. Later, he worked odd jobs in the Fushun Coal Mine, where the wages were low, he couldn't get enough to eat, and no one cared for him when he was sick. Lying on the coal pile to bask in the sun, he was kicked and beaten by the Japanese, who forced him to go down the coal pit. He hated the Japanese who managed the factory. In the autumn of 1945, the news of Japan's surrender reached Fushun. Little Bingwu thought, "The time to avenge has come!" He and many other workers poured into the local security team. The security team was reorganized into a formal "Eighth Route Army." When Little Bingwu first put on a brand-new military uniform and wore his badge, he looked at himself left and right, so happy that he couldn't sleep half the night.

I Want to Be an Artilleryman Sooner or Later

Although Little Bai Bingwu joined the ranks with enthusiasm, he became frightened when he saw the wounded soldiers coming from the front lines. He naively thought, "Fighting also injures people! Let's go home and do other work!" But then he thought, "Where is home? The instructor takes care of me better than my own brother and sister-in-law!" He hesitated again. After fighting a few battles with the veteran soldiers, he learned a lot of battlefield knowledge. Bullets whizzed past him, but didn't hit him. Little Bingwu gradually became brave.

In 1946, Bai Bingwu was still in the rifle squad, but he fell in love with the 75mm field gun pulled by six or seven mules. Once, he saw with his own eyes that a cannonball hit the enemy's tall bunker, collapsing most of it. He thought, "A rifleman's bullet can only kill one enemy. It would be great to be an artilleryman!" He repeatedly asked to go to the artillery squad. The instructor said, "Artillery is harder than infantry. You are small and weak and can't do it." Bai Bingwu was not discouraged. When the troops encamped, he took the time to go to the artillery platoon. He asked the aiming hand, Sui Jiyin, "Can I help you wipe the cannon?" While wiping the cannon, he asked all sorts of questions. Sui Jiyin explained to him the names, performance, and usage of each component of the field gun, and he carefully wrote them down in a small notebook. The two gradually became good friends.

Sometimes the two lived far apart, making it inconvenient for Bai Bingwu to go to the artillery platoon, which made him feel troubled. He thought about it and suddenly remembered that he used to make toys out of sorghum stalks when he was a child. He began to explore making a model of the field gun with sorghum stalks, including the barrel, front carriage, and other parts. Before and after meals, whenever he had free time, he would familiarize himself with the gun operation. This successful experiment made Bai Bingwu even more eager to become an artilleryman.

When the higher-ups discovered that Bai Bingwu liked being an artilleryman so much, they transferred him to the artillery squad with Sui Jiyin. Bingwu was overjoyed. He cleaned and tidied the 75mm field gun until it was clean and beautiful. In battle, he carefully learned Jiyin's gun operation techniques. Soon, he became an alternate aiming hand.

During the Qingfengdian campaign, our army surrounded tens of thousands of bandits. A fierce battle was brewing. The artillery company marched 180 li in a hurry, rushing from afar and entering the position. As soon as the fortifications were built, the target was exposed, and twelve enemy planes swooped down and strafed the field gun position. The artillerymen moved into the air raid shelter. A bomb exploded. Bai Bingwu's heart skipped a beat. He was worried about the cannon and looked out the entrance. The field gun position was smoking, and there were several boxes of shells next to it. If the shells exploded, the field gun would be finished. The situation was extremely urgent. Bai Bingwu thought, "This cannon is related to the lives of many brothers. Even if I, Bai Bingwu, sacrifice myself, I must move the shells away." Without reporting to the squad leader, he quickly rolled towards the position. Just as he left the entrance, a bullet flew by. He touched his hand, and his cotton coat was on fire. He simply took off his cotton coat and kept rolling forward. When he and his comrades finished moving the shells, he turned around and saw that his closest comrade-in-arms, Sui Jiyin, had sacrificed himself. His hand was still clutching the "cannon scope," which was splattered with blood. Bai Bingwu hugged Jiyin's body tightly, feeling both hatred and anxiety. He bit his lip. "Jiyin, I will never forget your training. I will definitely avenge you!" At that moment, the order to fire came. He took the cannon scope from the deceased's hand. The planes were still strafing. He relied on the fortifications and fired nine shots in a row, hitting the target continuously. With the sound of the cannon fire, the soldiers charged forward like a tide, and the enemy was thrown into chaos. This was the first time he used a cannon to kill the enemy, and his long-cherished wish had come true.

After the battle, the company commander ordered Bai Bingwu to take over Sui Jiyin's job and gave Bingwu Jiyin's favorite artillery textbook as a memento. Bingwu mourned Jiyin's sacrifice and vowed in his heart: "Jiyin, you were a famous marksman. I will definitely maintain your glorious tradition. As long as I don't sacrifice, I will intensify my studies and become a 'Divine Gunner.'"

Creating New Operating Techniques

With the development of the military situation, the troops gradually transitioned to large-scale regular operations, and artillery technology urgently needed to be improved. The entire brigade began a large-scale training exercise.

When people were taking a nap, there was often a young soldier on the training ground, concentrating on practicing his movements. When he was really tired, he would doze off on the gun mount and then start practicing again. This young man was Bai Bingwu.

Through repeated practice, he was able to operate the range dial and elevation gear simultaneously and use them freely. This small success encouraged him to further study the combination of various machine parts. Bai Bingwu's leap in operating techniques caused a sensation throughout the brigade.

Bingwu was not satisfied with this. In order to create more conditions for defeating the enemy, he was determined to familiarize himself with all the machine parts to the point where he could operate them with his eyes closed. In this way, if he encountered the enemy at night, he could fire accurately even without using the rangefinder or scope. So he studied and practiced hard day and night. He often closed his eyes, memorized the code words, and recited the commands while practicing his hand movements. He cherished every moment of his time, practicing in the stables while feeding the horses. After the lights-out whistle blew, he memorized the commands in his mind and took the cannon scope into his bed to practice. Sometimes he didn't pay attention and shouted out the commands. The soldiers said, "Bai Bingwu is obsessed with training. He even talks in his sleep at night." Sometimes he really was talking in his sleep.

He not only practiced hard himself but also paid attention to helping others. In the later stages of training, he was promoted to deputy gun commander. Under his influence and specific help, he trained six artillery aiming hands who were proficient in the entire set of operations.

Due to his outstanding achievements, he received the honor of "First-Class Model Marksman" and was accepted as a member of the Communist Party of China.

Are There Any Insurmountable Difficulties?

The first battle after the training exercise was the Taiyuan campaign. Bai Bingwu was particularly excited. The opportunity to perform meritorious service and kill the enemy had come. He was determined to use his actions to respond to the rewards and hopes that the superiors and comrades had placed in him.

However, when the artillery entered the position and moved the field gun, his right hand was kicked by a horse. There were still more than ten hours before the firing time, and the comrades went to rest. He walked into the artillery shelter, sat on the gun mount, and looked at the gun's machine parts, all of which were turned by fingers. Looking at his swollen, injured hand, he felt extremely distressed. He experimented with touching the dial with his palm, and a sharp pain spread throughout half of his body. He looked at the cannon and frowned, unable to think of a solution. "Maybe I can't fire the cannon," he thought silently as he walked out of the artillery shelter. But then he thought, "Am I retreating in the face of difficulties? How can I be called a model!? I am a Communist Party member, and I should overcome any difficulties." He sat back on the gun mount, endured the pain, and rubbed the range dial with his trembling palm. Extending upwards along his palm, he tried rubbing it with his wrist. The pain was reduced a lot. His wrist was weak, so he wrapped the bandages that were used to wrap his hands around his wrist to make it harder. Rubbing the range dial, the force to assist the graduation and other machine parts increased, and the dial rotated. With hope, he forgot the pain even more, rubbing it again and again, gradually being able to properly grasp the meter position, original number, and skillfully fire the cannon.

The target was a steel-reinforced concrete bunker on the enemy's position at Xiaoyaotou on the outskirts of Taiyuan. With the order to fire, the first shot hit the target. He excitedly fired three consecutive shots, all hitting the target. A thick plume of smoke soared into the sky. The bandits "took a plane [fled]." "Well done! Well done!" Cheering came from the infantry front line.

The bugle for the charge sounded, and the task was completed. Bai Bingwu felt a burst of piercing pain in his injured hand.

　　神炮手白炳武的成长
    力文
    白炳武以“神炮手”的荣誉出席全国战斗英雄会议了。他曾两次当选为全炮兵旅“甲等模范瞄准手”，所在班获得“技术冠全军”的奖旗，所在连被誉为“神炮第六连”。在打遍华北，转战西北的清风店、石家庄、太原、兰州等战役中，射击炮弹的命中数，占总数的百分之九十五。
    就是这个“神炮手”，五年前，还是抚顺炭矿的一个普通工人，一九四五年秋天，他刚参军的时候，见到伤兵，心中害怕，他到炮兵排也只短短三年的光景。矿工怎样掌握了重武器的技术——白炳武成长的过程，也正是人民解放军由小到大，壮大发展的侧影。
    报仇的时候到了
    白炳武是辽东省兴滨县人，从小就地无一垅，房无一间，父母去世早，跟哥嫂长大，因为和地主家小孩闹架，曾遭到一顿毒打，他偷跑出来，流浪到抚顺讨饭，后来在抚顺炭矿做零工，工资少，吃不饱，生病没人管，躺在炭堆上晒太阳，碰上日本人，一顿拳打脚踢，逼着他下炭坑。他痛恨管厂的日本人。一九四五年秋，日本投降的消息传到抚顺，小炳武心里想：“报仇的时候到了”，他和许多工人涌进当地组织的保安队，保安队改编为正式“八路军”，当小炳武第一次穿上崭新的军装，带上证章的时候，左看右看高兴的半夜睡不着。
    早晚要当个炮兵
    小白炳武虽然一股热劲参加了队伍，当他看到从前线下来的伤员时，心中却害怕起来了。他天真的想：“打仗还要伤人啊！回家做别的工作吧！”但转念到：“那里是家？指导员照顾自己，比亲哥嫂还周到呢！又犹豫了；跟着老战士们打了几仗，学会许多战场知识，子弹嗖嗖的从身边穿过，并没打到身上，小炳武渐渐地勇敢起来。
    一九四六年，白炳武还在步枪班，却爱上那门六、七匹骡子拉的三八野炮了。有一次，他亲眼看见，一炮打中了敌人几丈高的碉堡，炸崩了大半，他想：“步枪手一颗子弹，只能打死一个敌人，当炮兵多好啊！”他几次要求下炮兵班，指导员说：“炮兵比步兵更苦，你个小力弱干不了。”白炳武不灰心。部队宿营了，他抽空便到炮兵排打转，他问瞄准手随纪银：“帮忙擦炮可以吗？”他一面擦着炮，一面问长问短，随纪银把野炮各个构成部分的名称、性能、怎样使用讲给他，他用心的记在小本上。两个人渐渐成为好朋友了。
    有时两个人住处相距很远，到炮兵排不方便，使白炳武感到苦恼。他想来想去，忽然想起童年时曾用秫秸杆扎玩具耍，他便开始摸索着用秫秸杆扎成有炮身，前车等部分的野炮模型，不论饭前饭后，一有空闲，便随时熟悉用炮动作。这一试验的成功，白炳武当炮兵的劲头更大了。
    当上级发现白炳武这样欢喜当炮兵的时候，便调他到随纪银那个炮兵班。可把炳武乐坏了。他把三八野炮收拾得干净漂亮，打起仗来，细心的学习纪银的用炮动作，不久，便成为备附瞄准手。
    是清风店战役的时候，我军把数万匪军团团包围了，在酝酿着一场恶战，炮兵连一百八十里急行军，远道赶来，进入阵地，刚筑好工事，目标暴露了，十二架敌机向着野炮阵地，低飞扫射，炮兵们转入防空洞，一颗炸弹爆炸了，白炳武心里一动，他不放心炮，到洞口瞧望，野炮阵地在冒烟，旁边还有几箱子炮弹，炮弹一炸，野炮就完了，情况十分紧急，白炳武想：“这门炮关系着多少弟兄的生命啊，豁上我白炳武，也得把炮弹拿开”，没有报告班长，他连忙滚向阵地，刚出洞口，一颗子弹飞来，用手一摸，棉衣着火了，索性脱掉棉衣，不停的又滚向前去。当他和其他伙伴运完炮弹，扭转身，看见他最亲密的战友随纪银牺牲了，手还握紧“炮镜”，镜上溅满了鲜血，白炳武紧抱着纪银的遗体，又恨又急，牙咬着嘴唇，“纪银，我忘不了你对我的培养，一定为你报仇”，正在这时，传来了发炮的命令，他从死者手中取出炮镜，飞机依然在扫射，他依托工事，连发九炮，连续的命中，随着炮的轰炸声，战士们潮水似的冲上去了，敌军混乱了。这是他第一次用炮杀伤敌人，多日的愿望实现了。
    战斗结束了，连长命白炳武担任随纪银的工作，并把纪银最心爱的一本炮兵教材，交给炳武作为纪念。炳武痛惜着纪银的牺牲，心中发誓：“纪银啊，你是出名的射击手，我一定保持你的光荣传统，一天不牺牲，也会加紧学习，当上一名‘神炮手’。”
    创造新的操作技术
    随着军事形势的发展，部队日渐转入大兵团正规作战，炮兵的技术急需提高，全旅开始了大练兵。
    当人们午睡休息的时候，操场上常有个青年战士，目光集中的操练动作，实在疲困了，炮架上打个瞌睡，又开始练习，这个青年是白炳武。
    他在反复操练中，他能够同时操作标尺转轮及起落机，并且运用自如。这一小小的成功，鼓励他进一步研究各部机件的结合。白炳武操作技术的跃进，轰动了全旅。
    炳武并没有因此满足。为创造更多的战胜敌人的条件，他又在立志熟悉各部机件，熟练到闭眼可以操作的程度。这样，夜间遭遇敌人，即使不用标尺、镜子，也能发炮命中。于是他夜以继日的进行研究、苦练，他经常闭上眼睛，记着暗号，一面喊口令，一面熟练手的动作。他珍惜着一时一刻的时间，喂马时，在马棚里练习，吹熄灯哨了，心里默记着口令，把炮镜拿进被窝里练。有时不注意，口令喊出口来，战士们说：“白炳武练兵练迷了，晚上还说梦话”，有时他是真在说梦话了。
    他不仅自己苦练，还注意帮助别人，练兵后期，被提升为副炮长，在他的影响和具体帮助下，培养出六个精通全套业务的炮兵瞄准手。
    由于优越的成绩，他获得“甲等模范瞄准手”的荣誉，被接受为中共党员。
  有不能克服的困难吗？
    练兵后的第一次作战，是太原战役。白炳武格外兴奋，立功杀敌的时机到了，他决心用行动来回答上级和战友们对他的奖励与希望。
    可是，当炮兵进入阵地，运动野炮的时候，他的右手被马踢伤了。离发射时间还有十几个钟头，同志们休息去了。他走进炮兵掩体，坐在炮架上，看看炮的机件，都是用手指扭转的，看看臃肿的伤手，感到万分苦恼。用手掌试验着触动转轮，激剧的疼痛，疼遍半个身子。望着炮发愁，想不出办法，“大概是不能发炮了”，他默默的走出炮兵掩体，但他又想：“在困难面前退却吗？这还称得起什么模范！？我是共产党员，什么困难都应该克服。”他重新坐在炮架上，忍受着疼痛，用颤动的手掌擦着标尺转轮，沿手掌向上延伸，试探着用手腕擦动，疼痛减少许多，手腕发软，又用包扎双手的绑带，缠在手腕上，手腕硬一些，擦动标尺，补助分划等机件的力量增大，转轮转动了。有了希望，更忘记了疼痛，一次连一次的擦动，渐渐能恰当的掌握米位，原数，又能熟练的发炮了。
    射击目标是太原外围，小窑头敌军阵地上的一个钢骨水泥的地堡垒，随着发炮命令，第一炮便打中了，他兴奋的连发三弹，弹弹命中，一股浓烟冲天，匪军“坐了飞机”，“打得好！打得好”步兵前沿传来了拍手叫好的欢呼声。
    冲锋号吹起，任务完成了，白炳武感到那只伤手，一阵阵刺骨的疼痛。
