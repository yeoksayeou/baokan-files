　　Glorious Historical Struggle
    Li Lin
    "If we depart from Comrade Mao Zedong's policies, if we depart from the masses of the people, we will not only be unable to crush the enemy, but we would have been crushed by the enemy long ago." - Commander-in-Chief Zhu

    Our People's Liberation Army has been around for twenty-three years, from its birth to the present. Twenty-three years of time turns children into adults, middle age into old age. The People's Liberation Army has also grown from a small guerrilla force into a powerful army, second only to the Soviet Union in the world. This force annihilated 1,735,199 Japanese and puppet troops in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan. In the four-year War of Liberation, it annihilated another 8,071,350 Kuomintang troops. The total of the two numbers is nearly 10 million. The People's Liberation Army has grown from a tens of thousands-strong Workers' and Peasants' Red Army guerrilla force into an invincible army of five million.

    What is the reason for this? Commander-in-Chief Zhu, in the opening few sentences, has already concisely and pertinently explained the experience of building the People's Liberation Army. The countless pictures and physical objects displayed in the War Achievements Exhibition more specifically and vividly illustrate this irrefutable truth.

    Here is a photo of the exterior of "Panyu Middle School" in Guangzhou. More than twenty years ago, this place was called "Panyu Xuegong," which was the site of the National Peasant Movement Training Institute. In 1926, Chairman Mao also served as the director of the institute. This school implemented military management, and the curriculum included the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism and the problems of the Chinese revolution. Looking at this photo, we know that more than twenty years ago, Chairman Mao had already practically cultivated armed cadres. At this time, the Great Revolution had already begun, and the Chinese Communist Party led the workers of Shanghai to hold three armed uprisings. The heroic posture of the workers' pickets vividly appears before us.

    One photo shows the "First Provincial Congress of Farmers' Associations of Hubei Province." The slogans at the meeting are clearly visible. One is "Down with imperialism, down with warlords," and the other is "Guarantee the power of the Farmers' Associations."

    When the revolution was developing victoriously, the "April 12th" coup d'état began. A reproduced old newspaper reads: "Nearly a hundred communists executed in Shanghai by firing squad; Chiang orders immediate execution upon verification." This newspaper did not fully report the real situation at the time. "Upon verification" - this was meaningless in Chiang Kai-shek's view. His policy was "Better to kill a thousand by mistake than to let one go free." Many revolutionaries were martyred without any formal "interrogation."

    The brutal slaughter did not scare the Communist Party and the revolutionary people. Another reproduced old newspaper reads: "Wild grass cannot be burned out, the spring breeze blows and it grows again. The peasant army of the Guangdong Communist Party rises up to fight Chiang." Indeed, the world-shaking Nanchang Uprising, Autumn Harvest Uprising, and Guangzhou Uprising began. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu successfully joined forces in Jinggangshan. Revolutionary base areas were established, and the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army continued to fight for the Chinese people's revolution. "The Red Army is the army of the workers and peasants." This slogan, which expresses the essence of the Red Army, still remains on the walls of Suichuan villages.

    The struggle at that time was extremely arduous. A photo captures the scenes of single-shot guns, spears, and seven-section whips. The Red Army guerrillas had to fight against the superior enemy with these primitive weapons. Food was very scarce, and the soldiers filled their stomachs with pumpkins and vegetable roots. Commander-in-Chief Zhu and the soldiers trudged up and down the fifteen-mile Qixi Ridge, carrying rice from Jinggangshan to Ninggang. The more difficult the environment, the more the Red Army relied on the masses and patiently carried out mass work. The scene of the Red First Division helping the masses harvest crops is clearly displayed before us.

    Many physical objects fully illustrate the scale of construction in the base areas at that time. Silver coins cast with the words "Workers of the World, Unite!", certificates given by the People's Government to the families of revolutionary soldiers, the Red Army's party cards and armbands, fairly exquisite printed stamps and publications, documents from the trade union introducing workers to join the army, documents and proclamations of the Provisional Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic, etc., all remind people that twenty years ago, in our ancient and vast land, a prototype of a people's democratic dictatorship state appeared. It slowly grew and developed in the face of countless "encirclement and suppression" attacks by the enemy, and on October 1st of last year, the People's Republic of China was founded on its basis. The great Chinese people's revolution has come to a victorious end.

    Chiang Kai-shek concentrated all his efforts to attack the Soviet area at that time. How many farmers' houses were burned down. However, the farmers held mass meetings, swore to join the Red Army, and avenge their blood debts. More than eighty wounded soldiers in a certain Red Army hospital were brutally killed by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army. Red Army soldiers took off their hats to mourn their martyred comrades and resolved to give the brutal enemy a redoubled blow. In the Battle of Guihuashan, a Red Army platoon leader was wounded in seven places and heroically sacrificed his life. The people risked their lives to bury and erect a monument for this platoon leader. The monument read, "Tomb of a certain platoon leader who died in the Battle of Guihuashan in 1923." Obviously, the people did not know the name of this platoon leader, but they knew that he was a Red Army soldier, so they carefully arranged the platoon leader's remains.

    While Chiang Kai-shek was concentrating on attacking the Soviet area, the Japanese did not encounter any resistance and drove straight into our country. The Northeast changed color, North China was in danger, and the whole of China was shrouded in a gloomy atmosphere. In order to go north to resist Japan, in October 1934, the Red Army began the world-shaking Long March. Two years later, in October 1936, the various Red Army forces arrived in northern Shaanxi. The elite of the Chinese nation then successfully converged on the banks of the Yellow River, the birthplace of the nation. The hardships and difficulties during the Long March were indeed unbearable for ordinary people, but in the face of the Red Army led by the Communist Party, these difficulties were overcome one by one. Chairman Mao's poem about the Long March, "Ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains are nothing but ease," represents the Red Army's great spirit of not fearing everything.

    Not long after the Red Army arrived in northern Shaanxi, the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out under the pressure of the Chinese Communist Party and the will of the people. Chiang Kai-shek, who was brave internally but timid externally, showed wavering, negativity, timidity and incompetence from beginning to end. The huge army he led initially retreated rapidly, abandoned the people and fled south, all the way to Mount Emei in Sichuan. Later, he further colluded with the enemy and constantly attacked the anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians led by the Communist Party. From 1940 to 1943, Chiang's bandits launched three anti-communist upsurges in succession, attempting to cooperate with the Japanese invaders to eliminate the Communist Party and achieve compromise and surrender to Japan. However, under the constant warnings of our party and the unanimous condemnation of the people, each time it ended in failure. The Eighth Route Army, led by our party, numbering only 70,000, and the New Fourth Army, which was reorganized from the Jiangnan Red Army guerrillas, advanced from northern Shaanxi to northwestern Shanxi, Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei, and southeastern Shanxi. Later, they advanced to the vast areas behind the enemy in central Hebei, southern Hebei, eastern Hebei, Hebei-Luyu, Shandong and even central China. From the mountains to the plains, from the Yellow River to the Yangtze River. The anti-Japanese flames of the people spread from the mountains and black waters of Northeast China to the Dongjiang and Pearl River in Guangdong. With the help and support of this army, anti-Japanese governments of the people were organized everywhere, implementing reasonable burdens, rent reduction and interest reduction, and various policies of democratic freedom. The enemy and its echoers may call these policies and practices "small favors and bribes to win over the people's hearts," but the people see from this what the government is doing and what it will do. Therefore, young and middle-aged farmers rose up to organize self-defense forces and militias to undertake various war services. Children formed children's corps and young pioneers, guarding posts and sending messages. Women formed women's anti-Japanese salvation associations, sewing military uniforms and shoes, and providing tea and food for the troops. The roar of "Down with Japanese imperialism" resounded through the sky, and stories of sending sons and husbands to join the army to kill the enemy emerged one after another.

    From the annihilation of the elite Itagaki Division at Pingxingguan in 1937 to the Hundred Regiments Offensive in 1940, in three years, the Japanese gradually realized that the real obstacle to the destruction of China was the Chinese Communist Party, its army and the anti-Japanese regime behind the enemy. The Japanese came to a conclusion: without eliminating this force, it would be impossible to destroy China. Therefore, starting in 1938, especially after the Hundred Regiments Offensive, the enemy transferred its main force invading China to North China to attack various anti-Japanese base areas. They concentrated 64% of the total number of invading troops and 95% of the puppet troops in North China, constantly carrying out "suppression" and "mopping up." In 1941 and 1942 alone, there were 19 large-scale mopping-up operations and more than 500 small-scale mopping-up operations in the Shanxi-Hebei-Luyu Border Region (not counting the frequent attacks in the border areas).

    The barbaric and brutal enemy created many ways to eliminate the anti-Japanese forces behind the enemy. For areas that could not be occupied, they implemented the "three alls" policy of burning all, killing all, and looting all, creating many "no-man's lands." In the Wutai Mountain area of northern Shanxi alone, more than 100,000 houses were burned down, and the population was exterminated within a radius of hundreds of miles. The tragic scene of the Pingyang Village Massacre in Fuping County in the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region was shocking and infuriating. More than 1,000 young and middle-aged people, women, children, and the elderly were sacrificed under the butcher's knife of the Japanese invaders. Among them, 60 women were stripped naked and beheaded by the enemy, pregnant women were cut open by the enemy with sharp knives, and children were burned to death in mountain caves. The enemy dug out the hearts of the dead to stir-fry and eat. A similar tragedy occurred in Panjiayu Village, Fengrun County. 1,035 villagers were killed, more than half of whom were women and children. This is called a bloodbath of the village. In 1943, the enemy swept through the Beiyue District of Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei, killing 35,000 livestock and looting 12,000. The people's pots, bowls, and cans were smashed. The enemy's purpose was to make the anti-Japanese army and cadres lose their support and lose the conditions for survival and development. This is their touted "separation of fish and water" method.

    In the plains areas, the enemy implemented the "cage policy." They used railways as pillars, highways as chains, and blockhouses as locks, supplemented by crisscrossing block ditches and walls, dividing the anti-Japanese base areas into small grid networks, and then implementing "repeated suppression" and "rolling and picking," attempting to eliminate the anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians. For this purpose, the enemy built more than 10,000 kilometers of highways and established more than 1,800 strongholds in the central Hebei area alone. Central Hebei was divided into more than 2,700 small grids. The gap between the grids was only five li on average.

    The power and wisdom of the people are forever incomprehensible to the aggressors and rulers who are enemies of the people. They thought that with superior forces and modern equipment, they would be able to eradicate the anti-Japanese forces. But they were wrong. The awakened people have more ways to deal with them.

    Before the people's regular army has developed to the point where it can engage in large-scale decisive battles with the enemy, it usually tries to attack the enemy's weaker line or several lines, opening a gap in the enemy's line; at the same time, it cuts off the enemy's supply line, causing the enemy to lose the power of sustained combat; at the same time, it launches political and military offensives behind the enemy, causing the enemy's rear to waver and unable to take care of both ends. These methods have made the enemy pay a very high price for each attack, and in the end, they always had to run away helplessly.

    The People's Liberation Army more frequently and extensively adopted the method of struggle, using a part of the elite main force as the backbone, combined with guerrilla forces and militias, using methods such as sparrow warfare, landmine warfare, and tunnel warfare to strike the enemy everywhere. Militias and guerrillas buried landmines, stone mines, and magnetic mines (the latter two were created by the masses themselves) on all possible roads and all possible places where the enemy might pass. The enemy will encounter explosions when walking on main roads, explosions when walking on small roads, and explosions in the stone piles on the river beach; sitting on a stone to rest, the stone explodes. Pushing doors and windows, opening pot lids, and opening cabinets are all in danger of being smashed to pieces at any time. Sometimes they walked past the foot of the mountain, and landmines exploded halfway up the mountain, and huge rocks flew down from the air. The enemy trembled and put up "Beware of Landmines" signs everywhere. In order to turn "dead mines into live mines," the militiamen often used gunfire to lure the enemy into the landmine line. After the landmines exploded, they took advantage of the enemy's panic to launch a surprise attack. This is called "the combination of landmines and rifles, and the combination with sparrow warfare."

    The tunnel warfare of the anti-Japanese people in the plains, combined with landmine warfare and sparrow warfare, made it even more difficult for the enemy to overcome. Tunnels first appeared near the enemy's strongholds. The masses dug various tunnels under stoves or kang holes, which were originally temporary shelters against the enemy. Later, the tunnels between households were opened, and the tunnels between villages were also opened. The masses began to realize that this was not only a good place to hide themselves, but also a good weapon to strike the enemy. In the plains, the enemy's mechanized troops and cavalry can move very conveniently; unarmed guerrillas and militias are naturally in an extremely unfavorable position. With tunnels, people can boldly defend the fortifications in the village and fight the enemy stubbornly. After inflicting considerable casualties on the enemy, or in the event of a sudden emergency, the militiamen calmly guarded the sealed entrances with landmines and cold guns. When the enemy was in a panic, the militiamen quietly rushed out from another entrance, climbed to high houses or high ground, and attacked the enemy from a high position, making it impossible for the enemy to defend against and exhausting themselves.

    The enemy once used the method of flooding and poisoning to attack the tunnels. In the winter of 1942, more than 2,000 people were poisoned to death in the tunnels of Nanbeitang, Ding (County) South County, Central Hebei. At this time, the anti-Japanese people developed infinite wisdom and creativity. They dug the tunnels into small mountain roads that went up and down. If they found water or poisonous gas attacking, they could immediately block the entrance and stop the spread. Some tunnel entrances were dug with traps, covered with a movable wooden board, and with many sharp bamboo sticks underneath. If an enemy who was not familiar with the terrain broke in, they would fall into the trap.

    Tunnel warfare has gradually developed into a true art. The number of hidden entrances has increased, and military and civilian activities have become more convenient. Behind the murals in the house, under the grass sheds and stone tables in the courtyard, and under the dead trees and graves on the edge of the village, there are secret entrances. Some entrances are set in well buckets, and people, documents, and weapons can be hoisted into the cave with buckets. In Ding County and Raoyang County, Central Hebei, many wounded soldier hospitals were set up in tunnels during wartime. Women who sew, farmers who chop firewood, pick up dung, and plow fields are all informants or mobile sentries of these hospitals. The cross-sectional and longitudinal models displayed in the exhibition room vividly show this moving struggle.

    With such a safe barrier, the masses' fighting confidence and courage are even more high-spirited. They buried landmines all the way to the railway and in front of the bunkers. Landmines and cold guns worked together, allowing the enemy to be attacked at any time. Later, few enemies dared to go out. Bunkers and lines became the enemy's own prison dragons. At this time, the masses used various social relations to launch "psychological warfare" to disintegrate the enemy, and often won the bunkers without a fight. Sometimes, when they saw a suitable opportunity, the military and civilians cooperated to burn, blow up, and dismantle these bunkers.

    In the War of Resistance Against Japan, the military and civilians behind the enemy created countless tragic epics that will last forever. In order to keep the secret of a hospital's location, an anti-Japanese woman in Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei was willing to be stabbed to death by the enemy with bayonets. A twelve-year-old child named Wen Sanlang was captured and suffered all kinds of torture. He had two fingers cut off, but he did not reveal a word of truth from beginning to end. In 1941, on Langya Mountain, ninety miles northwest of Baoding and two thousand meters above sea level, Ma Baoquan and other five warriors fought with 5,000 Japanese invaders for a whole day, killing more than 40 enemies. In the end, they ran out of ammunition and food. The five warriors destroyed their guns and heroically jumped off the cliff. Three of them died heroically, and two were hung on trees on the mountainside and did not die. They finally returned victoriously. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the enemy carried out eight autumn mopping-up operations, lasting more than 230 days, and finally could not subdue the people of the Langya Mountain area. The enemy's so-called strategist, Lieutenant General Abe, was killed in action here.

    In order to protect their fighting backbone - the army, the people supported the front line selflessly. They rescued the wounded on the fire line amidst gunfire and bullets, carrying and lifting them to a safe area. Some were gloriously wounded while rescuing the wounded. Many of those who undertook this work were women. They brought the wounded to their homes, boiled water to cook, poured stools and urine, and the children stood guard outside, while the adults stayed up all night to take care of the wounded. They helped the army scout the terrain and enemy situation, transport military rations, ammunition, guard prisoners, clean up the battlefield, and lead the army through dangerous areas to attack the enemy.

    The masses' infinite enthusiasm for the troops was partly due to their endless hatred for the enemy, and partly due to the fact that the People's Liberation Army implemented the policy of supporting the government and cherishing the people stipulated by the Party. During the gaps in the war, the army helped the masses sow, hoe, harvest, carry water, and chop firewood, just like their own family members. During the famine years of 1942 and 1943, the army reclaimed wasteland, planted fields, and ate wild vegetables and tree leaves to reduce the burden on the masses, and drew part of the provisions they received from the government to relieve the victims.

    In order to ensure the replenishment and repair of ammunition, so that the anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians would not be difficult if the amount of spoils seized was not much and when needed, our comrades in the ordnance production department did a great job. The production of hand grenades in the North China region was originally dozens per month, and later developed to 300,000 per month, and the quality was also greatly improved. Workers in the North China Ordnance Repair Factory collectively created wooden milling machines, which increased work efficiency by dozens of times. During the enemy's "mopping up," the factory could switch to underground or other places at any time to continue to insist on work.

    All this ensured that our regular troops could flexibly implement the strategies and tactics instructed by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and constantly give the enemy heavy blows. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our army eliminated nearly 530,000 Japanese troops (nearly 520,000 of whom were killed) and 1.2 million puppet troops. It seized 1,038 cannons of various types, 7,783 machine guns of various types, and 436,964 long and short guns. If merits are rewarded, the top merit for defeating the Japanese invaders on the Chinese battlefield should belong to the People's Liberation Army and the vast patriotic people. (Attached picture)

　　光荣的历史斗争
    李林
    “如果我们离开了毛泽东同志的政策，如果我们离开了人民群众，我们就不但不能压碎敌人，并且早就被敌人压碎了。”——朱总司令
    我们的人民解放军从诞生到现在，已经二十三年了。二十三年的时光，使儿童变为成人，中年变成老年。人民解放军也从小小的游击队发展为世界上除苏联外少有的强大陆军。这支部队在八年抗日战争中，歼灭了日伪军一百七十三万五千一百九十九人。在四年解放战争中，又歼灭了国民党军八百零七万一千三百五十人。两数合计近一千万人。人民解放军则由几万人的工农红军游击队，发展成五百万人的无敌大军。
    其中的原因是什么呢？朱总司令在篇首的几句话中，已经把人民解放军的建军经验，扼要而中肯的说明了。战绩展览会中陈列的无数图片和实物，更具体生动地说明了这个颠扑不破的真理。
    这里有一张照片，是广州“番禺中学”的外景。二十多年以前，这个地方叫作“番禺学宫”，是全国农民运动讲习所的校址。一九二六年，毛主席曾经兼任该所所长。这个学校实行军事管理，课程是马列主义的基本理论和中国革命问题。看了这张照片，我们晓得，还在二十多年以前，毛主席就已经实际地培养武装干部了。这时大革命已经开始，中国共产党领导着上海工人，举行了三次武装起义。工人纠察队的雄姿，栩栩如生地出现在我们面前。
    一张照片的内容是“湖北省农民协会第一次全省代表大会”，会场上的标语历历在目，一条是“打倒帝国主义，打倒军阀”，一条是“保障农民协会之权力”。
    革命正在胜利发展的时候，“四一二”苦迭挞开始了。一张影印的旧报纸上写着：“沪枪决共产党近百人，蒋下令一经讯实立予正法。”这张报纸并没有完全报道出当时的真实情况，“一经讯实”——这在蒋介石看来是没有意义的，他的方针是“宁可错杀一千，不得漏网一人”，许多革命者殉难时，是没有经过什么正式“讯问”的。
    残酷的虐杀并未能吓倒共产党和革命的人民。另一张影印的旧报纸写道：“野草烧不尽，春风吹又生。广东共产党之农民军蜂起讨蒋。”真的，震动世界的南昌起义、秋收起义、广州起义开始了。毛主席、朱总司令在井岗山胜利会师了。革命根据地建立起来，工农红军继续为中国人民革命而战。“红军是工农的军队”，这种道出红军本质的标语，至今还留在遂川农村的墙壁上。
    当时的斗争是极艰苦的。一副照片中摄着独弹枪、矛子、七节鞭的镜头，红军游击队曾经不得不以这种原始的武器和优势的敌人作战。食粮十分缺乏，战士们以南瓜、菜根充饥。朱总司令和战士们一同跋涉上下十五里的七溪岭，从井岗山到宁岗一带担米。环境越是艰苦，红军越是依靠群众，耐心地进行群众工作。红一师帮助群众收割庄稼的情景，清清楚楚地展示在我们的面前。
    许多实物充分地说明了当时根据地的建设规模。铸有“全世界无产阶级联合起来”字样的银币，人民政府赠给革命军人家属的证件，红军的党证和袖章，印刷相当精美的邮票和出版物，工会向部队介绍工人参军的证件，中华苏维埃临时中央政府的公文、布告等等，都使人想到，二十年前，在我们古老而广袤的土地上，出现了一个人民民主专政国家的雏形，它在敌人无数次“围剿”进攻中，慢慢发扬光大，到去年十月一日，以它为基础，成立了中华人民共和国。中国的人民大革命，至此胜利地告一段落。
    蒋介石集中全力进攻当时的苏区。多少农民的房子被烧毁了。但是，农民们召开了群众大会，宣誓参加红军，报血海深仇。某红军医院中有八十多个伤员，被蒋介石匪军惨杀了，红军战士们脱下帽子，向自己殉难的战友致哀，决心以加倍的打击，给予残暴的敌人。在桂花山战斗中，一个红军排长负伤七处，英勇牺牲了。人民冒着生命的危险，替这位排长安葬立碑，碑上写着“一九二三年桂花山战斗牺牲某某排长之墓”。显然，人民并不晓得这位排长的名字，但是晓得他是一个红军，所以，他们珍重地安置了排长的遗体。
    在蒋介石专心致志地进攻苏区的时候，日本人没有遇到任何抵抗，长驱直入地打进我国。东北变色，华北危急，全中国被一种阴郁的空气笼罩着。为了北上抗日，一九三四年十月，红军开始了震动世界的万里长征。两年以后，即一九三六年十月，各路红军到达陕北，中华民族的精英遂在民族发源地的黄河边上胜利会师。长征过程中的艰难困苦，确非常人所能忍受，但在共产党领导的红军面前，这些困难都被一一克服了。毛主席长征诗中的“万水千山只等闲”，即代表红军这种不怕一切的伟大气魄。
    红军到达陕北不久，抗日战争就在中国共产党与全国人民意志的压力下爆发了。勇于对内、怯于对外的蒋介石，自始至终表现了动摇、消极、怯懦无能。他所领导的庞大部队，开始是迅速溃退，抛弃了人民向南逃跑，一直逃到四川峨嵋山。以后则进一步与敌人勾结起来，不断袭击共产党领导下的抗日军民。一九四○年至一九四三年，蒋匪连续发动三次反共高潮，企图配合日寇消灭共产党，达到对日妥协投降。但是，在我党不断敲响警钟、全国人民同声怒斥之下，每次均归失败。我党领导的为数不过七万的八路军和江南红军游击队改编成的新四军，从陕北挺进到晋西北、晋察冀、晋东南。以后又挺进到冀中、冀南、冀东、冀鲁豫、山东以至华中敌后广大地区。从山地进入平原，从黄河走到长江。人民的抗日烈火，从东北的白山黑水之间一直延烧到广东的东江、珠江。经过这支部队的帮助与支持，人民抗日政府遍地组织起来，实行合理负担、减租减息与各种民主自由的政策。敌人和它的应声虫们尽可把这些政策与做法称作“小恩小惠、收买民心”，但人民却从中看出这个政府是在做着什么，还要做些什么。于是，青壮年农民纷起组织自卫队和民兵，担任各种战争勤务。孩子们组成儿童团、少先队，站岗放哨，带路送信。妇女们组成妇女抗日救国会，缝制军衣军鞋，给部队烧茶送饭。“打倒日本帝国主义”的吼声，响彻云霄，送子送郎参军杀敌的故事，层出不穷。
    从一九三七年平型关歼敌精锐板垣师团起，到一九四○年的百团大战，三年之间，日本人逐渐看出灭亡中国的真正障碍，乃是中国共产党、她所领导的军队和敌后人民的抗日政权。日本人得到一个结论：不消灭这个力量，灭亡中国是不可能的。于是从一九三八年开始，特别是在百团大战之后，敌寇把它的侵华主力调到华北，进攻各个抗日根据地。他们在华北集中了侵华部队总数的百分之六十四和伪军的百分之九十五，不断头地进行“清剿”、“扫荡”。一九四一年至一九四二年两年中，仅对晋冀鲁豫边区的大规模扫荡就有十九次，小规模扫荡五百多次（边沿地区的经常袭击不计）。
    野蛮残暴的敌人，创造了许许多多消灭敌后抗日力量的办法。他们对于无法占领的地区，实行烧光、杀光、抢光的“三光”政策，创造许多“无人区”。仅在山西北部的五台山地区，就烧毁民房十多万间，方圆数百里灭绝了人烟。晋察冀边区发生的阜平县平阳村大血案的惨景，使人触目惊心，咬牙切齿。一千多个青壮年与妇孺老弱在日寇的屠刀下牺牲了。其中有六十个妇女被敌人剥光衣服砍了头，孕妇被敌人用尖刀剖开了肚子，小孩子们被烧死在山洞中。敌人把死者的人心剜出来炒菜吃。丰润县潘家峪村发生了情景相同的惨案。该村农民被杀一千零三十五人，其中妇女儿童占一半以上。这叫作血洗村庄。一九四三年敌人扫荡晋察冀的北岳区，杀死牲口三万五千头，抢走一万二千头。老百姓的锅碗盆罐都被砸碎。敌人的目的，是使抗日的军队与干部失去依托，失去生存发展的条件。这就是他们所吹嘘的“鱼水分家”办法。
    在平原地区，敌人实行了“囚笼政策”。他们以铁道为柱，公路为链，碉堡为锁，辅以纵横交错的封锁沟、封锁墙，将抗日根据地分割成细小的格子网，然后实行“反复清剿”、“辗转抉剔”，企图以此清除抗日的军民。为了这目的，敌人仅在冀中地区就修筑了一万多公里公路，建立了一千八百多个据点。冀中被分割为二千七百多个小格子。格子间的空隙地区，平均只有五华里。
    人民群众的力量与智慧，永远是与人民为敌的侵略者、统治者所不能理解的。他们以为有了优势的兵力与近代化的装备，就一定可以根绝抗日的力量。但是，他们想错了。觉醒了的人民有更多的办法来对付他们。
    人民的正规军在自身还没有发展到能同敌人进行大规模决战以前，通常是设法进攻敌人比较薄弱的一路或数路，在敌人的阵线中打开缺口；同时截断敌人的补给线，使敌人丧失持久作战的力量；同时在敌人背后开展政治的、军事的攻势，使敌人的后方发生动摇，首尾不能兼顾。这些办法曾使敌人每次进攻都付出极高的代价，最后总是无可奈何地跑走了。
    人民解放军更经常地、大量地采用的斗争方式，是以一部分精干主力为骨干，结合游击部队和民兵，用麻雀战、地雷战、地道战等方法，漫山遍野，到处打击敌人。民兵和游击队把地雷、石雷、磁雷（后二者为群众自己所创造）埋在敌人一切可能经过的道路上，和一切可能到达的地方。敌人走大路会遇到爆炸，走小路会遇到爆炸，在河滩的石堆中会遇到爆炸；坐在石头上休息，石头爆炸。推门窗、揭锅盖、开柜子，随时都有粉身碎骨的危险。有时他们从山脚下走过，半山里地雷响了，巨大的石块从空中飞下。敌人战战兢兢，到处插起“小心地雷”的牌子。为使“死雷变成活雷”，民兵们经常用枪声引诱敌人，跑到地雷阵线里。在地雷炸响之后，乘敌慌乱之际，予以突然袭击。这叫作“地雷与步枪结合，与麻雀战结合。”
    平原地区抗日人民的地道战与地雷战、麻雀战结合起来，更使敌人增加了不可克服的困难。地道最初出现在敌人的据点附近。群众在炉灶底下或炕洞里边挖好各种地洞，原来是对付敌人的临时避难所。以后户与户间的地洞打通了，村与村间的地洞也打通了，群众开始发现这不但是隐蔽自己的好场所，而且是一种打击敌人的好武器。在平原，敌人的机械化部队和骑兵行动非常便捷；徒手的游击队和民兵，自然处于极端不利的地位。有了地道以后，人们可以大胆地坚守村里的工事，和敌人顽强作战。在已予敌人相当杀伤之后，或情况突然紧急时，民兵们从容地用地雷和冷枪守着封好的道口。打得敌人慌乱了，民兵又从另一个洞口悄悄冲出来，爬到高房上或高地上，居高临下，袭击敌人。使敌防不胜防，疲于奔命。
    敌人曾经以放水、放毒的办法来袭击地道。一九四二年冬，冀中定（县）南县南北塘的地道中，曾被毒死两千多人。此时，抗日人民发扬了无穷的智慧和创造力。他们把地道挖成一上一下的小山道，发觉有水或毒气袭击，立刻可以堵死口子，停止蔓延。有的地道进口处挖了陷阱，上面盖着活木板，底下插着许多尖利的竹签。不熟悉地形的敌人一闯进来，便会跌到陷阱里。
    地道战逐步发展成一种真正的艺术。隐蔽的洞口增多，军民活动更加方便。屋子里的壁画后面，院子里的草棚、石棹下面，村边的枯树和坟堆下面，都有隐秘的洞口。有些洞口设在井桶中，人和文件、武器都可用水桶吊到洞里去。冀中定县、饶阳等县，许多伤兵医院战时都设在地道中。作针线的妇女，打柴、拾粪、耕田的农民，都是这些医院的情报员或游动哨。展览室中摆列着的横断面、纵断面的模型，生动地表现着这种可歌可泣的斗争。
    有了如此安全的屏障，群众的斗争信心与勇气更加昂扬。他们把地雷一直埋到铁道上、碉堡前。地雷和冷枪配合，使敌人随时可以遭受打击。以后少数敌人简直不敢出门了。碉堡和线路变成了敌人自己的囚龙。这时，群众利用各种社会关系开展“攻心战”瓦解敌人，常常不战而夺得了碉堡。有时看准一个适当机会，军民配合起来，就把这些碉堡烧掉、炸掉、拆掉了。
    在抗日战争中，敌后军民创造了不知多少千古不磨的悲壮史诗。为了保守一个医院驻地的秘密，晋察冀一个被俘的抗日妇女甘心被敌人用刺刀刺死。一个名叫温三郎的十二岁的孩子，被俘后受尽酷刑，被割去两个指头，自始至终没有吐露一句真话，一九四一年，保定西北九十里、拔海二千公尺的狼牙山上，马保全等五个勇士和五千日寇打了一整天，杀死敌人四十多个，最后弹尽援绝，五勇士毁掉枪枝，英勇跳崖，其中三人壮烈殉国，二人挂在山腰树上未死，最后胜利归来。抗战八年，敌人实行了八次秋季大扫荡，先后历时二百三十多天，终于不能屈服狼牙山区的人民。敌人所谓的战略家阿部中将，却在这里战死了。
    人民为了保护自己的战斗骨干——军队，奋不顾身地支援前线。他们在枪林弹雨的火线上抢救伤员，背着抬着，弄到安全地带。有的为抢救伤员自己光荣负伤。担任这种工作的，有许多是妇女。她们把伤员弄到自己家里，烧水煮饭，倒屎倒尿，小孩在外面放哨，大人在里面通宵不寐地看护伤员。他（她）们帮着军队侦察地形、敌情，运送军粮、械弹、看管俘虏，打扫战场，领着军队通过危险地带去打击敌人。
    群众对于部队的无限热情，一方面是由于他们对敌人的无穷憎恨，一方面也是由于解放军贯彻执行了党所规定的拥政爱民政策。在战争空隙中，军队帮着群众下种、锄苗、收割、担水、打柴，完全同群众自己家里人一样。在一九四二至一九四三年的灾荒岁月，军队开荒种田，打野菜、树叶充饥，减轻群众的负担，并把自己从政府领到的给养抽出一部分救济灾民。
    为了保证械弹的补充与修理，使抗日的军民不致在缴获不多，需要时发生困难，我们的兵工生产部门的同志们做了巨大的工作。华北区的手榴弹生产，原来是每月数十枚，后来发展到每月三十万枚，质量也大大提高。华北修械厂工人集体创造木制铣床，使工作效率提高数十倍。在敌人“扫荡”时，工厂随时转入地下或其他地方，继续坚持工作。
    这一切，保证了我们的正规部队能机动灵活地执行毛主席和朱总司令所指示的战略战术，不断地给敌人以沉重的打击。八年抗日战争中，我军消灭日军近五十三万（内有近五十二万为击毙者），消灭伪军一百二十万。缴获各种炮一○三八门，各种机枪七七八三挺，长短枪四三六九六四支。如果论功行赏，在中国战场上，战胜日寇的头功，应该是属于人民解放军和广大爱国人民的。（附图片）
