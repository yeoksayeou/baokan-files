Jilin Yushu County, Based on New Rural Circumstances
Will Invest Surplus Grain in Improving Agricultural Technology

[Reported by this newspaper] A Northeast Daily News dispatch: The Yushu County People's Government in Jilin Province, in light of the abundant harvest this autumn, will select a key village in each district during the autumn harvest period. Combining this with leading the autumn harvest, they will understand the rural surplus grain situation and mobilize farmers to invest surplus grain in improving agricultural production technology for next year, in order to expand reproduction. This is the work timely proposed by the county based on the most active new situation in the rural economy after the autumn harvest.

Yushu County is a major grain-producing county in the Northeast. After three years of production campaigns following the land reform, every household had surplus grain last year, and basic needs for carts and horses were met. This year, another widespread bumper harvest has been achieved, so farmers will have a large amount of surplus grain in their hands after the autumn harvest. According to preliminary estimates from surveys in three villages, the average total income from agricultural and sideline occupations per farmer in the county, after deducting living expenses for next year and the estimated state grain tax, is still one shi of surplus grain (prosperous villages may have 1.5 shi per person; medium villages, 1 shi per person; the worst villages, 0.6 shi per person). With nearly 600,000 farmers in the county, there are approximately 600,000 mu of surplus grain (equivalent to 150,000 tons). Regarding the handling of this grain, most farmers plan to use it to expand reproduction next year, but a small number feel there is nowhere to use it. Taking Xinfacun in Taiping District, where the county's economic situation and work foundation are both average, as an example: out of approximately 2,000 shi of surplus grain in the village this year, excluding living expenses and grain tax, 1,700 shi in the hands of poor and lower-middle peasants can be invested in production next year; another 300 shi in the hands of eight landlords and rich peasants, half is prepared to purchase more carts and horses, and the other half is prepared for lavish spending or storage. Among the farmers who are preparing to invest surplus grain in building houses and production next year, there are also various different ideas: most are preparing to buy horses and carts or replace weak horses with strong horses; a small number of good production teams, under the influence of the county farm, hope to purchase a set of new-style horse-drawn farm implements before the Lunar New Year. There are also some households that do not have enough money to buy carts and horses or already have enough carts and horses, who are preparing to deposit surplus grain in the credit department of the rural cooperative.

Based on the above problems discovered in various districts and the current rural economic development situation, the county has made an analysis and study. At the joint meeting of district secretaries and branch secretaries from one village in each district recently held, it was arranged that while grasping the leadership of the autumn harvest work, each district must conduct education for farmers on actively expanding agricultural investment next year, targeting various different ideas of the farmers, and at the same time point out that: in the current situation where the county has surplus labor, basic needs for horses are met, and there is no wasteland to open up, emphasis should be placed on encouraging farmers to plan agricultural investment next year from the perspective of improving and raising agricultural production technology. Adding carts, buying horses, or replacing weak horses with strong horses should be based on the needs of improving agricultural technology and combined with improving agricultural technology; at the same time, it should be adapted to the current objective conditions for improving technology in each district and each village. At the same time, rural supply and marketing cooperatives should rectify and expand their business, welcome the upcoming most active season of the rural economy, accurately investigate, research, and supply farmers with the means of production and means of livelihood they require; since some farmers are preparing to invest part of their surplus grain in the credit department of the cooperative, the leadership of the credit department's work should be strengthened. In the winter cultural studies for farmers that are being prepared, the focus of political study should be on improving and raising agricultural production technology to expand reproduction next year.

　　吉林榆树县根据农村新情况
    将把余粮投入改进农业技术
    【本报讯】东北日报消息：吉林省榆树县人民政府，鉴于今年秋季丰收，即在秋收中每区选择一重点村，结合领导秋收，了解农村余粮情况，并动员农民把余粮投资于明年改进农业生产技术，以扩大再生产上。这是该县根据秋收以后农村经济最活跃的新情况，及时提出的工作。
    榆树县为东北产粮县，经过土地改革后的三年生产运动，去年即家家有余粮，车马基本够用，今年又普遍获得丰收，因而今年秋后农民手中将有大批余粮。根据三个村的调查初步估计，全县平均每个农民农副业总的收入，除去明年生活资料和预计缴出的国家公粮以外，尚有余粮一石（富裕的村每人可余一石五斗；中等村每人一石；最差的村每人六斗）。全县近六十万农民，约有六十亩石余粮（合十五万吨）。对这些粮食的处理，大部农民准备用于扩大明年再生产，但也有少部分觉得无处可用。以全县经济情况、工作基础均为中等的太平区新发村为例：全村今年除生活资料和缴公粮以外的约二千石余粮中，在贫雇中农手中的一千七百石可投入明年生产；另在八户地主及富农手中的三百石，有半数准备添购车马，其余一半则准备大吃大喝或贮藏起来。在准备以余粮修盖房屋投资明年生产的农民中，也有各种不同的想法：大部分准备购马买车，或将弱马换成强马；少数好的生产小组，在县农场影响下，希望在旧历年前购到一套新式马拉农具。还有部分钱款不足，不能买车购马或已有够用车、马的户，准备将余粮存入农村合作社的信贷部中。
    该县根据各区发现的上述问题和目前农村经济发展情况，做了分析和研究。在最近召开的各区区书及每区一村的支部书记联席会议上，布置各区于抓紧领导秋收工作同时，必须针对农民各种不同思想，分别进行对农民积极扩大明年农业投资的教育，同时指出：在目前全县劳力有余马匹基本够用，而且无荒可开的这一情形下，应着重使农民多从改进和提高农业生产技术上着眼来筹划明年农业投资，添车、购马，或用弱马换强马，应根据改进农业技术需要，和改进农业技术相结合；同时应以各区、各村目前改进技术的客观条件相适应。与此同时，农村供销合作社应整顿和扩大业务，迎接即将到来的农村经济最活跃的季节，确切的调查、研究并供给农民以他们所要求的生产资料和生活资料；由于部分农民准备将部分余粮投入合作社的信贷部，应重点加强信贷部工作的领导。在准备开展的农民冬季文化学习中，应当以改进、提高农业生产技术扩大明年再生产为政治学习中心。
