　　In Truman's Aggressive War Plan
    American Monopoly Capitalists Make a Fortune
    [Xinhua News Agency, 19th] Imperialist war economy means big capital groups get rich. Figures recently released by American official and semi-official organs prove this point. The US Congress, taking advantage of the Korean War, passed over 30 billion US dollars in so-called supplementary military appropriations. According to the US Information Service, more than half of this huge appropriation, namely over 17 billion, will be used for "purchasing goods", and the vast majority (13 to 14 billion) are so-called "hard goods", that is, airplanes, artillery, tanks, electronic equipment, bullets, and the like. Therefore, most of these war appropriations will directly flow into the hands of the manufacturers of so-called "hard goods", that is, the largest monopoly groups in steel, automobiles, chemicals, aviation, and electricity. In the approximately two and a half months after the outbreak of the Korean War alone, companies received government so-called "defense" orders amounting to more than 7 billion US dollars.
    According to the income and expenditure reports published by major American companies, even before the Korean War, major American companies had already made a fortune from the Truman government's so-called "Cold War production" plan. General Electric, one of the largest monopoly capitals in the United States, which undertakes a large number of aircraft engine manufacturing for the government, had an annual net profit rate of 147 million US dollars in the first quarter of this year, an increase of approximately 38 percent over the same period last year. The second quarter increased to an annual rate of 164 million US dollars, an increase of approximately 11 percent over the first quarter. Another large monopoly company, DuPont, the main contractor for the government's atomic weapons manufacturing, saw its net profit increase by approximately one-quarter in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period last year, and by another one-quarter in the second quarter compared with the first quarter. With the government's new huge orders, profits will continue to increase.
    In Truman's war plan, the American aircraft industry has benefited particularly greatly. The Truman government's plan to expand the Air Force to 48 groups last year more than doubled the profit of the American aircraft industry in one year. After launching the war in Korea, the Truman government set another plan to expand the Air Force to 69 groups. The American aircraft company bosses, whose products are slaughtering peaceful Korean people in large numbers, will therefore receive more than 8 billion US dollars taken from taxpayers from the government in the first year of Truman's arms expansion plan.
    The Truman government plans to use the blood of peaceful people to build golden palaces for American monopoly capitalists. Therefore, the Wall Street mouthpiece "US News & World Report" praised the Truman government's provocation of war in Korea as creating a "sweet situation" for American capitalists.

### 在杜鲁门的侵略战争计划中  美垄断资本大发其财

　　在杜鲁门的侵略战争计划中
    美垄断资本大发其财
    【新华社十九日讯】帝国主义的战争经济就是大资本集团发财。美国官方与半官方机关新近发表的数字证明了这一点。美国国会假朝鲜战争的机会，通过了三百多亿美元的所谓补充军事拨款。据美国新闻处称，这笔巨大拨款，将有一半以上即一百七十多亿用于“购买货物”，并且绝大部分（一百三四十亿）是所谓“硬货”，即飞机、大炮、坦克、电子装备、枪弹之类。因此，这些战争拨款的大部分，将直接流入所谓“硬货”的制造者，即钢铁、汽车、化学、飞机、电气各最大垄断集团的手中。单单在朝鲜战争发生后约二个半月中间，公司收到政府的所谓“国防”定货数额就已达七十多亿美元。
    根据美国各大公司公布的收支报告，早在朝鲜战争以前，美国大公司就已因杜鲁门政府的所谓“冷战生产”计划大发其财了。美国最大垄断资本之一、承造政府大批飞机引擎的通用电气公司，今年第一季的纯利年率达一亿四千七百万美元，比去年同期增加约百分之三十八。第二季增加到年率一亿六千四百万美元，较第一季又增加约百分之十一。另一个大垄断公司，政府原子武器制造的主要承办者杜邦公司，今第年一季纯利较去年同期增加约四分之一，今年第二季较第一季又增加约四分之一。在政府新的庞大订货下，利润将继续增加。
    在杜鲁门的战争计划中，美国的飞机业获利特别巨大。杜鲁门政府去年度把空军扩展至四十八大队的计划，使美国飞机工业的利润额在一年中就增加了一倍多。在发动朝鲜的战争之后，杜鲁门政府又定了一个把空军再扩展为六十九个大队的计划。其产品正在大批地残杀着朝鲜和平人民的美国飞机公司老板们，因此将在杜鲁门扩军计划的第一年中，就自政府接收取自纳税人的八十多亿美元。
    杜鲁门政府设计用和平人民的鲜血来为美国的垄断资本家铸造黄金宫殿。所以美国华尔街的喉舌《美国新闻与世界报导》曾满意地称赞杜鲁门政府在朝鲜挑起战争，是为美国的资本家创造了一个“如意局面”。
