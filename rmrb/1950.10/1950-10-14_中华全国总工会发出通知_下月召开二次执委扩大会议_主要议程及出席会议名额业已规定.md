Discuss the issue of labor insurance regulations; 6. Discuss the draft revision of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Charter; 7. Elect replacements for the eight vacant positions (six formal, two alternates) on the Executive Committee left by the Sixth Labor Congress.

The allocation of attendee and observer slots is as follows: All members and alternate members of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions must attend. Observers will include the chiefs and deputy chiefs of all departments, committees, offices, societies, and schools of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; one representative (chairman, director, or vice-chairman, vice-director) from each of the major administrative region's trade union federations and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions offices; one representative (chairman, director, or vice-chairman, vice-director) from each of the national committees of industrial trade unions and the preparatory committees of industrial trade unions; one representative (chairman, director, or vice-chairman, vice-director) from each of the trade union federations or preparatory committees of trade union federations in each province, administrative region, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region; one representative (chairman or vice-chairman) from each of the municipal trade union federations in Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, Dalian, Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, Taiyuan, Qingdao, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Xi'an; and five chairmen of grassroots trade union committees invited by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.
