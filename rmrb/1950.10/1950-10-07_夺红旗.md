　　Seizing the Red Banner
　　Liu Naiwu
　　The machines in the machine factory were turning as usual, but every worker had a surge of energy in their hearts. No one bothered to wipe away the sweat, their spirits were so high. This was in celebration of the first National Day, and the workers had spontaneously started a production competition, putting in all their effort, working hard, chasing, and not letting anyone fall behind.
　　Little Liu had just returned from Master Li's lathe, bouncing around, looking very happy, and ran to Master Zhou's lathe in a flash: "Master Zhou, let's work! If we turn two more, we'll catch up with Master Li and them, and if we turn three more, we'll get the red banner!"
　　"Even if we work hard, they won't be idle. It's not easy to catch up by three or two." Although Master Zhou was talking, his hands didn't stop, his eyes fixed on the work, and he was very happy in his heart; but outwardly he seemed like nothing was happening.
　　Little Liu said confidently: "Master Zhou! I guarantee the red banner will be ours. You changed to this template tool, which is much easier and faster than their rocker tool. If this tool breaks, there's another one!" Master Zhou smiled and didn't say anything.
　　After a while, Little Liu took the opportunity to run to other workshops to see how much others had done; before long, Little Liu ran back with a smile, as if to report good news to Master Zhou: "Master Zhou! This red banner is definitely ours, Master Li's tool broke."
　　Master Zhou said in surprise: "How did Master Li's finishing tool break..." Little Liu said happily: "Yes, Master Li's finishing tool broke. We don't have to work hard, we can easily overtake them, even if his tool didn't break, we can overtake him with the template tool." Little Liu was so happy that he jumped up and down, unable to close his mouth.
　　Master Zhou didn't say a word, he looked like he was still working, but he had something on his mind, his eyes staring blankly at the template tool, as if he was thinking about something. After a long time, Master Zhou pointed to the idle template tool and said: "You take this tool to Master Li." Little Liu was about to open his mouth, but after thinking about it, it didn't make sense, but after thinking about it again, maybe he heard it wrong, or maybe he was too happy, and didn't hear clearly, so he asked again: "What?" Master Zhou glanced at him, and pointed to the template tool with his finger: "Take this tool to Master Li." Little Liu stared at Master Zhou with strange eyes: "Master Zhou! What's wrong? Are we not competing anymore? If we give this template tool to Master Li, the red banner will be theirs." Master Zhou nodded and said: "Completing the task is important. If they don't have the template tool, the task will be a problem. Is the red banner important, or is the task important?" Little Liu understood, but he couldn't figure it out, so he lazily took the template tool and sent it to Master Li.
　　At noon, Master Zhou and Little Liu were eating together, Little Liu said: "Master Zhou! This time there's no hope for the red banner." He held a mouthful of sorghum rice in his mouth, chewing it incessantly without swallowing it.
　　"Little Liu! What's hopeless?" Master Zhou glanced at Little Liu with squinted eyes.
　　"The red banner!" Little Liu looked at Master Zhou pretending to be calm, angrily put the lunch box on the ground, and stood up to leave.
　　"Don't go." Master Zhou grabbed Little Liu: "Sit down, Little Liu."
　　Master Zhou took out his dry tobacco pipe, the tobacco pot was yellow and shiny, Master Zhou loaded a bag of tobacco, and started puffing on it. Little Liu took a look and knew it was bad, Master Zhou's old habit was that once his lips touched the cigarette holder, he would talk endlessly. "Little Liu, what are we competing for? Isn't it to complete the task ahead of schedule."
　　"Yes." Little Liu said in a dry and long voice.
　　Master Zhou puffed on his pipe for a long time, and spat out a mouthful of clear water. "To complete the task, it's not just one person's business. We don't have to talk about far things, let's take our Comrade Molotov as an example. The Soviet people ran all the way from so far to China, what do you say they are here for? Is it also for the red banner? Don't they get the red banner in their country? Didn't you hear the factory director say that they are here for us..."
　　As soon as Little Liu heard the old story starting again, he repeatedly stopped him: "Okay, okay, I know, this is two different things, what does this have to do with us giving the template tool to them?"
　　Master Zhou slowly knocked the tobacco pipe: "How can one thing be said to be two things? People are helping us build from thousands of miles away, and we, in order to compete for the red banner, hide the template tool and don't lend it to them, what do you call that?" Little Liu was so touched for the first time, he didn't know what to say to Master Zhou, he just felt that Master Zhou was really good.
　　After the competition, Master Li did one more job than Master Zhou. The union chairman carried the red banner, and the factory director, branch secretary, workers and staff, all came to congratulate Master Li. This made Master Li feel embarrassed. He thought to himself, if it weren't for Master Zhou's template tool, I wouldn't have gotten the red banner. So he said to the union chairman: "Chairman! I can't take this red banner, it should be sent to Master Zhou. I broke the finishing tool, and Master Zhou let me use his template tool. If I didn't use the template tool, he would have overtaken me long ago. Although I did a little more than him, the red banner shouldn't be given to me."
　　Before the chairman could speak, Master Zhou squeezed in from the crowd and said: "The conditions were made clear before the competition, whoever creates the highest record without producing defective products gets the red banner..."
　　Master Li抢着说: "If you didn't give me the template tool to use, I wouldn't have been able to do these things, except for me it's yours."
　　"The tool is the factory's tool, and modifying the tool is my job. You work for the factory, and if there is an idle tool, you should be allowed to use it." He also pointed to the Soviet people and said: "The Soviet elder brothers, are all here to help us with production and construction, if I have an idle tool and don't let you use it, is that right?"
　　The two people kept pushing each other, both saying that they were not qualified. Some people said: "The red banner should be given to Master Li, because he was first." Some people said: "Master Zhou should get the red banner, because he modified the tool, improved the output, and helped others to do more." Everyone also argued about this issue.
　　The union chairman and the factory director and branch secretary whispered for a while, and finally said loudly: "Everyone be quiet." Everyone was silent. He continued: "Our production competition to welcome the first National Day this time was done very well. Everyone used their brains, modified tools, and worked especially hard, breaking previous records, and showed a high degree of class friendship in the competition. We will make another red banner tomorrow and hold a factory-wide meeting. This one is for Master Li for being the first in the competition, and that one is for Master Zhou for being a model in the competition, does everyone agree?" Everyone responded in unison: "Agree."

　　夺红旗
    刘乃五
    机器厂里的机器，像平常一样的转着，可是各个工友心里都蹩着一股劲。汗往下流也没有人顾得擦，精神都十分紧张。这是迎接第一个国庆日，工友们自动掀起了生产竞赛热潮，使足了劲，干哪，撵啊，一个不让一个的干着。
    小刘刚从李师傅车床回来，蹦蹦躂躂的，看样子非常高兴，一溜烟的跑到周师傅床子前：“周师傅干哪，咱们再多车两个，就撵上李师傅他们了，要再多车三个，红旗可就是咱们得了。”
    “咱们干，人家也不呆着，差三两个也不容易撵哪。”周师傅虽然在说话，手还是不停着，眼睛盯着活计，心里乐的了不得；可是外表像没有啥事似的。
    小刘满有信心地说：“周师傅！我保险红旗一定是咱们的了，你改了这样板刀，比他们的摇刀省劲多了，又快又好，这把刀若是打了还有那把呢！”周师傅笑了，没说什么。
    过了一会，小刘又借空跑到别人的车间去了，看看别人又干了多少；不一会小刘笑呵呵的跑回来，像给周师傅报喜似的：“周师傅！这红旗没个跑，一定是咱们的了，李师傅的刀打了。”
    周师傅惊讶地说：“怎么李师傅的光刀打了……”小刘美吱吱的说：“是的，李师傅光刀打了，咱们不用费劲，宽宽绰绰的就能撵过他们，就是他不打刀，咱们用样板刀也能撵过他呀。”乐的小刘连蹦带跳，合不上牙了。
    周师傅一声也没吱，看样子手里还是干活，心里可有事，眼睛直发楞，瞅着样板刀，像寻思啥事一样。半天，周师傅指着闲着的样板刀说：“你把这把刀给李师傅送去。”小刘刚要张嘴，一寻思不是道理，可是又一寻思也许是听错了，也许乐大发劲了，没有听清楚，就又问了一句：“什么？”周师傅瞅了一眼，手指头指着板刀：“把这刀给李师傅送去。”小刘眼睛奇怪的盯着周师傅：“周师傅！咋的？不竞赛啦吗？把这样板刀给李师傅，这回红旗就是人家的了。”周师傅点了点头说：“完成任务要紧，人家没有样板刀，任务可就成问题了，是红旗要紧，还是任务要紧？”小刘明白是明白了，可是就想不通，懒洋洋地拿着样板刀，给李师傅送去了。
    晌午，周师傅和小刘在一块吃饭，小刘说：“周师傅！这回红旗没有指望了。”他含着一口高粱米饭，在嘴里一个劲的嚼也不往下咽。
    “小刘！啥没指望了？”周师傅斜着眼睛撇了小刘一眼。
    “红旗呗！”小刘看着周师傅装的挺像，气的把饭盒往地下一放，站起来要走。
    “别走。”周师傅一把捞着小刘：“坐下，小刘。”
    周师傅掏出旱烟袋，烟锅子使的又黄又亮，周师傅装上一袋烟，吧哒起来了。小刘一瞅要坏，周师傅老毛病是嘴唇一碰上烟嘴，唠起来就没个完了。“小刘，咱们竞赛为的是啥？是不是提前完成任务。”
    “是。”小刘干吧吧的长声说。
    周师傅吧哒吧哒嘴抽了半天，吐了一口清水。“为了完成任务，就不是一个人的事，咱不用远说，拿我们的莫利罗夫同志来说吧，苏联人从那么老远跑到中国来，你说人家为的啥？也是为的红旗吗？人家在国里不是一样得红旗吗？你没听厂长说，人家为的是咱们……。”
    小刘一听老话头又上来啦，就连声的拦着：“得、得、我知道，这是两码事，这跟咱们把样板刀送给人家有啥相干？”
    周师傅慢腾腾地把烟袋磕了：“一码事咋说两码事？人家千里迢迢帮助咱们建设，咱们为了争红旗，就把样板刀掖起来不借人家，你说这叫啥事？”小刘头一次这样感动，说不出要和周师傅说啥才好，就觉得周师傅这人真好。
    竞赛完了，李师傅比周师傅多干了一个活计，工会主任打着红旗，厂长、支书、工友和职员，都来给李师傅道喜。这一来李师傅倒觉得不好意思起来。自己寻思，若没有周师傅的样板刀我是得不着红旗的。于是向工会主任说：“主任！这红旗我不能要，应当给周师傅送去。我把光刀打了，周师傅把他的样板刀给我使，我要不使样板刀的话，他早把我撵过去了，我虽然比他多干一点，红旗也不该给我呀。”
    没等主任说话，周师傅由人群外挤进来说：“竞赛前条件讲的清楚，不出废品创最高纪录就得红旗……。”
    李师傅抢着说：“你要不给我样板刀使，我也干不了这些呀，除了我就是你的呀。”
    “刀是厂子的刀，改刀是我的工作，你给厂子工作，有闲刀就该给你使。”他又指苏联人说：“苏联老大哥，都来帮助咱们生产建设，我有闲刀不给你使那对劲吗？”
    两个人互相推让，都说自个不够格，有人说：“红旗应当给李师傅，因为他第一。”有人说：“周师傅应当得红旗，因为他改了工具，提高了产量，又帮助了别人多干。”大伙也为这个问题争吵起来。
    工会主任和厂长、支书小声合计了一会，最后大声说：“大家静一下。”大家都不吱声了。他接着说：“我们这次迎接第一个国庆日，生产竞赛做的很好，大家都用了脑筋，改了工具，也都特别卖力气，打破了以前的纪录，并在竞赛中，表现了高度的阶级友爱，明天再作一面红旗，召开全厂大会。这面给李师傅竞赛第一，那一面给周师傅竞赛模范，大家同意不？”大家异口同声的应着：“同意。”
