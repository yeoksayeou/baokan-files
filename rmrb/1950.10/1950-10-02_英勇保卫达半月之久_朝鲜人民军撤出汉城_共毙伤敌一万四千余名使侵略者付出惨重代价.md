Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 1st — The Korean People's Army, which defended Seoul, resisted the American aggressors who landed at Incheon and were overwhelmingly superior in number and equipment, for a total of half a month, forcing the enemy to pay a heavy price for every inch of land they seized. Subsequently, the People's Army actively withdrew from Seoul on September 30 and advanced to favorable areas to continue resisting the enemy.

In order to invade Seoul, the American aggressors mobilized almost all of the naval, land, and air forces they could currently use in the Far East, and also forcibly pieced together the forces, ships, and aircraft of vassal states such as Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France, and the Netherlands, as well as the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. They even unscrupulously used Japanese fascist ships and soldiers. From September 15th, the United States concentrated 300 warships (including major battleships such as the 45,000-ton Missouri) and 500 heavy bombers and fighters to cover the landing of 40,000 troops equipped with a large number of heavy artillery and tanks at Incheon, invading Seoul. Subsequently, due to the strong resistance of the People's Army, reinforcements were constantly added. In terms of troop types and equipment, paratroopers, heavy tanks, and flamethrower tanks were also used. In terms of operational materials, a huge amount of 500,000 tons per day was transported from Japan to Korea by trains, trucks, ships, and airplanes.

The American aggressors, mobilizing such a huge force, originally thought that invading Seoul would be easy. They repeatedly prematurely announced the "capture of Seoul." However, under the heroic resistance of the People's Army and the Korean people, the U.S. military not only made slow progress but also paid a heavy price for every inch of land they seized. Therefore, they had to repeatedly deny their own lies of "capture." In fact, the U.S. military, with a force twenty times greater than the People's Army, was only able to land at Incheon. Incheon is 30 kilometers away from Seoul, and it took the U.S. military half a month to invade Seoul after paying a heavy price. The bourgeois news agencies of the United States, Britain, France, and other countries, in their reports on the Battle of Seoul, had to frequently acknowledge the "difficult," "slow," "no progress," and "heavy price" situations of the U.S. military's progress. According to Zheng Kuan, the commander of the Korean People's Army defending Seoul, as of September 27th, the People's Army had killed and wounded 12,000 enemies in the Incheon-Seoul area, causing the enemy to lose more than 40 tanks, more than 120 artillery pieces of various types, and a large amount of equipment and ammunition; and sinking more than 30 enemy ships. After September 27th, the People's Army made the enemy pay a heavy price again. In the final street fighting on the 29th and 30th, as many as 1,900 enemies were killed.

The heroic spirit of patriotism of the People's Army and the Korean people, and the cowardice and brutality of the American aggressor bandits, have been further proven in the Battle of Seoul. The defenders of Seoul faced an overwhelmingly superior enemy with determination and bravery. Every soldier firmly guarded the position he should defend until the last drop of blood was shed. Among the 1.5 million residents of the city, 500,000 automatically participated in building fortifications. Workers, peasants, and youth of the whole city, men, women, old and young, supported the People's Army regardless of the enemy's bombing and artillery fire. Many people also directly participated in the battle. Whenever a soldier died in battle, his gun was immediately picked up by the people and continued to fire at the enemy. On the other side, the American robbers did not rely on morale in combat, but only on bombs and artillery. They could only "advance cautiously" under the cover of crazy air strikes (Kuomintang Central News Agency reporter). "Behind the advancing troops of the US military, there were only broken walls and ruins, and hundreds of yards in front of the advancing troops were houses burning under artillery fire" (United Press Seoul Front, 26th). Therefore, the solemn and beautiful ancient capital, which the Korean working people had painstakingly created for five hundred years and were proud of, has been "reduced to a pile of rubble" by the heinous American robbers.

Although Seoul has temporarily fallen into the clutches of the American aggressors after being turned into a pile of rubble, due to the heroic and unyielding will of the Korean people and the brutal cowardice of the American aggressors, the American aggressors have been mired in the angry sea of the Korean people for a long time. Final victory will surely belong to the Korean people, and Seoul will surely return to the hands of the Korean people in the end.

　　英勇保卫达半月之久
    朝鲜人民军撤出汉城
    共毙伤敌一万四千余名使侵略者付出惨重代价
    【新华社平壤一日电】保卫汉城的朝鲜人民军，抗击在仁川登陆的、在数量和装备上占压倒优势的美国侵略者，共达半个月之久，迫使敌人为侵占每一寸土地都付出了惨重代价。在此后，人民军已于九月三十日主动撤出汉城，进至有利地带继续抗击敌人。
    美国侵略者为侵占汉城，几乎动员了目前在远东所能使用的海陆空军的全部力量，并且又强迫拼凑了英、加、澳、新（西兰）、法、荷等仆从国家及李承晚匪帮的兵力、舰只和飞机，甚至还丧心病狂地利用了日本法西斯的船只和军人。从九月十五日起，美国集中了三百艘军舰（其中包括四万五千吨的米苏里号等主力战舰）和五百架重轰炸机与战斗机，掩护配备有大量重炮与坦克的军队四万人，在仁川登陆，进犯汉城。其后由于遭受人民军坚强抗击，并曾不断增援。在兵种与装备方面，又使用了伞兵、重型坦克与喷焰坦克等。在作战物资方面，则以每日五十万吨的巨额数量用火车、卡车、船舰和飞机从日本运到朝鲜。
    美国侵略者动员了这样巨大的力量，原以为侵略汉城轻而易举。他们曾一再过早地宣布“攻克汉城”。但在人民军与朝鲜人民的英勇抗击之下，美军不仅进展缓滞，而且每侵占一寸土地，都付出了惨重代价。因此，他们又不得不一再地否认自己的“攻克”的谎言。事实上，美军以大于人民军二十倍的兵力，才能够在仁川登陆。仁川离汉城三十公里，美军花了半个月的时间，才在付出惨重代价之后侵占了汉城。美、英、法等国资产阶级通讯社在关于汉城之战的报道中，也不得不经常承认美军进展“艰难”、“缓滞”、“毫无进展”及“付出了重大代价”的情况。据朝鲜人民军防卫汉城的司令官郑宽发表：到九月二十七日止，人民军在仁川——汉城地区共毙伤敌人一万二千名，使敌人损失了坦克四十余辆、各种炮一百二十余门及大量装备与弹药；并击沉敌舰三十余艘。二十七日以后，人民军又使敌人付出了重大代价。在二十九、三十两日的最后巷战中，仅击毙敌人即达一千九百名。
    人民军与朝鲜人民爱国主义的英雄气概，与美国侵略匪帮的怯懦与残暴，在汉城之战中又得到进一步的证明。汉城的保卫者面对占压倒优势的敌人，坚定而英勇。每一个战士坚决守住他所应当防守的阵地，直到流尽最后一滴血。全市一百五十万居民中，有五十万人自动参加构筑防御工事。全市的工人、农民、青年，男女老幼都不顾敌人的轰炸与炮火，支援人民军。许多人并直接参加了战斗。每当一个战士战死的时候，他的枪就立刻被人们拿起，继续向敌人发射。在另一边，美国强盗们作战不是依靠士气，而是光靠炸弹和大炮。他们只能在飞机狂炸的掩护下“小心翼翼地前进”（国民党中央社记者）。在美军“前进部队的后面，尽是断墙残壁，而在前进部队前面几百码，则尽是在炮火下燃烧的房屋”（合众社汉城前线二十六日电）。因此，朝鲜劳动人民五百年来所辛勤创造、并引为骄傲的庄严而美丽的古都，竟已被穷凶极恶的美国强盗“打成一片瓦砾”。
    汉城虽在变为一片瓦砾之后，暂时陷入美国侵略者的魔掌，但是，由于朝鲜人民英勇不屈的意志与美国侵略者的残暴怯懦，美国侵略者已长期陷入朝鲜人民愤怒的火海。最后胜利必将属于朝鲜人民，而汉城必将最后回到朝鲜人民手中。
