Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 11th (TASS dispatch): The Political Committee held a meeting on the morning of the tenth to continue discussing the so-called "United Action for Peace" proposal on the agenda.

　　Australian representative Spender spoke first. In his speech, he slandered the Soviet Union, particularly attempting to attribute the current international tension to the Soviet Union. Spender argued that the United Nations was not only facing the need to change the procedures of the General Assembly but also the need to revise the provisions in the UN Charter regarding the powers of "certain UN bodies."

　　Spender admitted that he initially doubted whether the seven-nation proposal conformed to the Charter. However, he ultimately supported three parts of the proposal: the part about emergency sessions of the General Assembly, the part about the observation committee, and the part stipulating the dispatch of detachments from the armed forces of various countries for "UN" use.

　　However, he opposed the fourth part of the seven-nation proposal, which stipulated the establishment of a Collective Action Committee to study ways and means by which the United Nations could maintain international peace and security. Spender said that the powers of this committee, as outlined in the proposal, were "too vague" and that "some member states would not provide the necessary information."

　　Spender urged the Political Committee to ask the major powers to consult on "the possibility of joint action by the major powers represented by the United Nations to maintain peace and security." At the same time, he suggested that the committee support the establishment of such agreements in regions of the world that do not currently have regional agreements. It is not difficult to guess that this last suggestion is merely a revamped version of Australia's attempt to conclude an aggressive "Pacific Pact."

　　Peruvian representative Belaunde spoke in favor of the seven-nation proposal. He gave a loud speech, full of arbitrary interpretations of the provisions of the United Nations Charter. He finally declared that the measures listed in the proposal were said to be in full compliance with the United Nations Charter.

　　However, he favored amending certain points in the proposal, and he specifically suggested amending the third part of the proposal, arguing that the procedure for assigning military detachments of the armed forces of various countries to the command of the United Nations should comply with the constitutions of the member states.

　　The Brazilian representative then spoke, insisting that the Security Council's current working procedures were imperfect and needed improvement. He said that the time had come to call the Security Council's attention to the need to eliminate its shortcomings. As he said this, he declared that the proposal currently under discussion would bring the work of the Security Council into line, although in reality, this proposal would undermine the functions of the Security Council.

　　After the representative of Yugoslavia delivered a speech in favor of the seven-nation proposal, the morning meeting was adjourned.

　　联大政治委员会十日上午会议
    澳代表无耻诽谤苏联
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约十一日电：政治委员会十日上午举行会议，继续讨论议程中所谓“保障和平的联合行动”的提案。
    澳大利亚代表斯宾德首先发言。他在讲话中对苏联进行诽谤，特别是他力图把现在的国际紧张情势归咎于苏联。斯宾德辩称：联合国不仅面临改变联大程序的必要，还面临修改联合国宪章中关于“若干联合国机关”权力的条款的必要。
    斯宾德承认他起先怀疑七国提案是否符合宪章。但是他最后还是支持了这个提案中的三部分，即：关于联大紧急会议的部分、关于考察委员会的部分，和规定从各国武装部队中调派分遣队以供“联合国”之用的部分。
    但是他反对七国提案中的第四部分，其中规定成立集体行动委员会来研究联合国可以用以维持国际和平与安全的办法和手段。斯宾德说这个委员会的职权，如提案中所举出的那样，是：“太空洞”了，而且“有些会员国会不供给所需要的情报”。
    斯宾德力促政治委员会要求各大国商议“各大国代表联合国进行联合行动以维持和平与安全的可能性”。同时他建议委员会支持世界上那些现在还没有区域性协定的地区成立这类协定。不难猜想：这最后的一个建议不过是澳大利亚关于缔结侵略性的《太平洋公约》这一企图的花样翻新而已。
    秘鲁代表碧朗第发言赞成七国提案。他高声演说，充满了对于联合国宪章条款的武断解释。他最后宣称：提案所列举的措施据说是完全符合联合国宪章的。
    不过，他赞成修改提案中的若干点，他特别建议修改提案的第三部分，主张以各国武装部队的军事分遣队划归联合国统率的程序应符合各会员国的宪法。
    巴西代表接着发言，他坚称：安全理事会现行的工作程序是不完美的，需要改善。他说：唤起安全理事会注意消灭其缺点之必要的时候现在已经到了。他说到这里，便宣称：目前在讨论中的提案将促使安理会工作纳入正轨，虽然实际上这一提案将破坏安理会的功用。
    在南斯拉夫代表发表演说赞成七国的提案以后，上午会议宣布散会。
