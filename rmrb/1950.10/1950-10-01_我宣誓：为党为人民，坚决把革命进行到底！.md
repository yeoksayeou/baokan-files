　　I Swear: For the Party and the People, I Will Carry the Revolution Through to the End!
　　Model Worker of the Army at the Advanced Age of Seventy-Three, Jiang Weiping

　　Last year, when I participated in the founding ceremony in Zhangjiakou, I thought back to how many difficulties and hardships we had gone through in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War to defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries. Victory was really not easy. This time, participating in the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers and celebrating the first National Day, on the one hand, I feel that the country's construction is progressing rapidly; on the other hand, I feel a great responsibility and should work even harder than before.

　　From the convening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to the establishment of the Central People's Government, the unity of all ethnic groups, democratic parties, and people from all walks of life, the existence of a great common program, and now the first solemn and grand National Day, these are all unprecedented events in thousands of years of history. These are all the crystallization of the Communist Party's great policies and Chairman Mao's correct leadership. I am old and have lived in the old society for a long time, and I have been oppressed the longest. I will never forget that kind of pain as long as I live. Since the day I joined the revolution and relied on the Communist Party, I have finally had a lifelong home. Now, throughout mainland China, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has been overthrown, and the Central People's Government has been established for a year. I feel that every Chinese person has a home.

　　I joined the army at the age of sixty, and this year is my thirteenth year. Although there have been small achievements in the meantime, they are only a drop in the ocean. Moreover, these achievements are the result of the Party's cultivation of me. I will never forget the Party, Chairman Mao, or the people. The people's contribution to the revolution is multifaceted, and only the people's merits are the greatest. All glory should belong to the people. This time I was selected as a representative to attend the meeting, and I wondered: Why was I chosen? What achievements do I have? If I say that I have not made any mistakes in these thirteen years, it is also due to the Party's education, which taught me to dedicate everything to the people's revolutionary cause. I have no personal fame, fortune, status, family, or other ideological burdens in my mind, only two words—revolution. Therefore, I can concentrate on doing revolutionary work well. If I am old and experienced, then this is the only experience.

　　After participating in this meeting, listening to the speeches of Chairman Mao and other leaders, and getting to know many heroic models and hearing many heroic deeds, I must do my job well when I return and play a leading role in national construction. Seeing the country's achievements in various aspects today, I am reminded that this is because the work was done well in the beginning that we have today. In the future, we should continue to adhere to this even better, so that the country's construction cause can thrive.

　　In 1943, when the conference of heroic models was held in Yan'an, there were only five or six hundred heroic models present. This time is different from that time. This marks the victory of the people's revolution and the correctness of the Party's policies. After this time, everyone must play a leading role. I believe that the scale of the next meeting will be even greater than this time; at the same time, I also believe that I can participate in the next meeting. Although I am older, my body can still compete with young people.

　　If American imperialism insists on seeking its own death and dares to provoke a war, I will once again request to go to the front line. When Zhangjiakou retreated in 1947, I requested to go directly to the battlefield and fight the enemy. Later, the superiors allowed me to work at the Peace Hospital. Of course, I will go wherever the Party wants me to go, but I am not afraid of sacrifice. On this first great National Day, I swear: I will resolutely work for the Party, serve the people, and carry the revolution through to the end, to answer the glory the people have given me. Just saying it is not enough, please look at my actions.

### 我宣誓：为党为人民，坚决把革命进行到底！

　　我宣誓：为党为人民，坚决把革命进行到底！
    七十三岁高龄的部队模范工作者  蒋维平
    去年在张家口参加开国大典时，回想到在八年抗日战争和打败国民党反动派的解放战争中，我们曾经度过了多少困难与艰辛。胜利实在是不容易的。这次参加了全国工农兵劳模代表会议和迎接第一个国庆节，一方面是觉得这一年来国家的建设是一日千里；一方面觉得责任重大，应该比当初更加倍努力。
    由人民政协的召开，到中央人民政府的成立，各民族、各民主党派、各阶层人民的团结一致，有了伟大的共同纲领和如今的第一个庄严隆重的国庆节，这些都是几千年来历史上空前未有的事情，这都是共产党的伟大政策和毛主席正确领导的结晶。我年纪大，在旧社会里生活久，被压迫的日子也最长，活着一天我也是忘不了那种痛苦的。自从我参加了革命投靠了共产党那天起，我才算终身有了依归。现在在全国大陆来说：蒋匪集团是被打倒了，中央人民政府成立已经一年了，我觉得每个中国人都有了依归。
    我从六十岁那年参军起，到今年已经十三个年头了。这中间虽然有了小小的成绩，但只不过是大海里的一滴水。而且这些成绩都是党培养我的结果。我忘不了党，忘不了毛主席，忘不了人民。人民对革命的贡献是多方面的，只有人民的功劳最大，一切光荣都应该归于人民。这回我被选为出席会议的代表，我觉得：为什么一选就选我，我有什么成绩呢？如果说：这十三年来我没出过错，那也是由于党对我的教育，党教育我把一切都献给人民的革命事业，我没有个人的名利、地位、家庭等观念，脑子里没有其他的思想包袱，只有两个字——革命。所以我能聚精会神地做好革命工作。如果说我年纪大、经验多，那么经验也只有这一条。
    参加了这次的会议，听了毛主席和各位首长的讲话，又认识了许多英雄模范们，听了许多英模的事迹。我回去一定要把工作做好，在国家建设中起带头作用。看了今天国家在各方面的成绩，就想起这是当初工作做得好才有今天，以后应该更好地坚持下去，国家的建设事业才能蒸蒸日上。
    一九四三年在延安开英模大会时，出席的英模才五、六百人，这次比那回可不一样。这标志着人民革命的胜利和党的政策的正确，这次大家回去后，每个人都要起带头作用，相信下次再开会时，规模一定比这次的壮大；同时也相信下次再开会时，我还能参加，我虽然年纪大点，但身体还可和年青人比赛。
    如果美帝国主义一定要找死，胆敢挑动战争，我就再度要求上前线。一九四七年张家口撤退时，我就曾要求直接到战场上和敌人拚，后来上级准我到和平医院工作。当然，我是党要我到那里我就到那里，但是我却不怕牺牲，在第一个伟大的国庆节的今天，我宣誓：坚决为党工作，为人民服务，把革命进行到底，来回答人民给我的光荣。光说还不行，请大家从行动上来看我。
