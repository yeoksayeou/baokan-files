　　Lingqiu Fifth District Supply and Marketing Cooperative
    Forbids Private Merchants from Collecting and Exchanging Local Products
    Comrade Wang Zhenbo's Letter of Criticism

To the Editor:
    In early October, I returned to my home in Huata Village, Fifth District, Lingqiu County, Chahar Province. I personally witnessed two private merchants from Fuping County and a peddler named Wang Yiqian exchanging kerosene, cloth, cotton, and other goods for the walnuts owned by the farmers, which was blocked by Wang Ren, a cadre of the district supply and marketing cooperative. Wang said to them: "The Chahar Provincial People's Government and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative have jointly ordered that merchants from other provinces and counties are prohibited from purchasing walnuts within the county. The local products of Lingqiu County should be sold by the Lingqiu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative." He then confiscated 35 jin of walnut kernels that Wang Yiqian had exchanged for kerosene.
    According to the village cadres of Sanlou Village and Zhou Zhenheng, a small merchant from Wuwangkou Village, Fifth District, Fuping County, he had gone to Lingqiu Fifth District to collect and exchange walnut kernels. After being discovered by Comrade Wang Ren, he was criticized and was to be taken to the district government for handling. As a result, the walnut kernels were confiscated, and the money was refunded. In fact, the district supply and marketing cooperative cannot supply the farmers with the goods they need in a timely manner. For example, when the weather gets cold, the farmers cannot exchange for cloth; without lamp oil, they have to live in the dark. Therefore, the farmers generally express dissatisfaction.
    I think this violates the policy of free domestic trade. Please publish this letter quickly, and I hope the local government will correct this erroneous behavior.
          Wang Zhenbo

    Editor's Note: Generally speaking, local governments should adopt a welcoming and helpful attitude towards legitimate merchants who purchase or exchange agricultural and sideline products in rural areas. Even if the merchants' purchasing work conflicts with the business of the local supply and marketing cooperative, a comprehensive and reasonable adjustment should be made based on the actual situation and from the perspective of the greatest interests of the residents. It is completely wrong if the supply and marketing cooperative cannot supply the farmers with the goods they need and does not allow merchants to carry out exchange work.

### 灵邱五区供销社  禁止私商收换土产  王震伯同志来信批评

　　灵邱五区供销社
    禁止私商收换土产
    王震伯同志来信批评编辑同志：
    十月初我回到察哈尔省灵邱县五区花塔村家里，亲眼见到阜平县两家私商及挑担小贩王怡谦，用煤油、布、棉等物，挨户换取农民所有的核桃仁，被区供销社干部王忍同志阻拦。王对他们说：“我们察哈尔省人民政府及供销社联令禁止外省外县商民到县境内购买核桃。灵邱县的土产应由灵邱县供销社负责推销。”当将王怡谦用煤油换来的三十五斤核桃仁扣留。
    又据三楼村干部及阜平县五区吴王口村小商贩周振恒说：他曾到灵邱五区收换核桃仁，被王忍同志发觉后，竟批评了他一顿，还要带他到区政府处理。结果核桃仁被扣留，折款发还。实际上，该区供销社并不能按时供应农民所需的物品。比如，天气冷了，农民换不到布；没有灯油，只得摸黑。因此农民普遍反映不满。
    我想，这是违反国内贸易自由的政策的。请你们迅速发表这封信，希望当地政府纠正这一错误行为。
          王震伯
    编者按：一般说来，对正当商人收购或交换农村土产，当地政府应采取欢迎和帮助的态度。即使商人的收购工作与当地供销社的业务有所抵触，也应根据实际情况，从居民的最大利益出发，作全盘的合理调整。如供销社既不能供应农民所需物品，又不准商人进行交换工作，那是完全不对的。
