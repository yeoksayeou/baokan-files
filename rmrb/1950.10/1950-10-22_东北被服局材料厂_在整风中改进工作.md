　　Northeast Garment Bureau Materials Factory
    Improves Work Through Rectification
    [This newspaper's Shenyang News] The Northeast Finance Department's Garment Bureau Materials Factory had unreasonable labor allocation, lax labor discipline among workers, and leaders were busy with administrative matters and lacked sufficient business research. This led to only 87% completion of the cotton fluffing task in August. In this rectification, the factory used "Why was the August task not completed?" as the theme, implementing inspection, rectification, and improvement simultaneously, and widely展开开d discussions among the staff and workers. The leadership first identified the above-mentioned problems and decided to implement a fixed-quota system, clarifying the division of labor among workers. In the past, three people watched two cotton fluffing machines, and the workers were mutually dependent, lacking a sense of production responsibility, and sometimes chatting and joking. As a result, each machine, on average, did not meet the prescribed task. Now, it has been changed to one person watching one machine, each being solely responsible. The workers have all improved their production enthusiasm and responsibility for caring for the machines, and there is no more joking around. The trade union seized this opportunity and conducted in-depth labor discipline education. The administration conducts technical education once a week. The workers have further improved their awareness and technical level. At the same time, basic-level cadres were reasonably allocated. In the past, there was one foreman per shift, managing production and personnel organization, and one technician, specializing in repairing machines. The foreman could not grasp the machine's performance, and was unable to understand production. The technician only repaired machines and did not care about production quality or quantity. Now, it has been changed to the technician兼兼班长, so that the technician is good at mastering machines and caring about production. Now, when the workers are busy, the technician helps them carry cotton and fluff cotton, which not only increases production but also allocates the remaining personnel to other groups, saving expenses. The factory has also established a reward and punishment system to ensure the smooth progress of production work.
    These improvements have basically overcome the past phenomena of lax labor discipline, improper labor allocation, and blind production. In September, the administration stipulated the operation of 852 machines, with a standard output of 550 jin per machine, for a total output of 468,600 jin. As of September 19, the output had reached 475,500 jin, exceeding the monthly task five days ahead of schedule (the September task started on August 26 and ended on September 25, excluding holidays). The average output per machine was 632 jin.

　　东北被服局材料厂
    在整风中改进工作
    【本报沈阳讯】东北财政部被服局材料厂劳动力配备不合理，工人劳动纪律松懈，领导上忙于事务，对于业务钻研不够，致八月份弹棉任务只完成百分之八十七。该厂在这次整风中，以“八月份任务为啥未完成？”作主题，实行边检、边整、边改，并在职工群众中广泛展开讨论。领导上首先找出上述病根，决定实行定员制，在工人中明确分工。过去三人看两台弹棉机，工友们互相依赖，缺乏生产责任心，有时说笑玩闹，结果，每台机器平均都达不到规定的任务。现在改为每人看一台机器，各负专责。工友都提高了生产积极性和爱护机器的责任心，再没有玩闹情形了。工会抓紧这个机会，深入地进行了劳动纪律教育。行政上每周进行一次技术教育。工友们更提高了自觉性和技术水平。同时合理配备了基层干部，过去是每班班长一人，管理生产和人事组织，设技工一人，专门修理机器。班长不能掌握机器性能，在生产上摸不着底，技工只是修理机器，对生产质量、数量也不关心。现在改为技工兼班长，使技工善于掌握机器，关心生产。现在技工在工友忙的时候，就帮助工友抱棉花、絮棉花，既提高了产量，又将剩余人员配备到别的组，节省了开支。该厂并已订立奖惩制度，以保证生产工作顺利进行。
    这些改进基本上克服了过去劳动纪律松懈、劳动力配备不当，和生产盲目性的现象。九月份行政上规定开动八百五十二台机器，每台标定产量五百五十斤，共产量四十六万八千六百斤。截至九月十九日，产量已达到四十七万五千五百斤，提前五天超额完成全月任务（九月份任务是由八月二十六日开始，到九月二十五日止，假日不算）平均每台机器出六百三十二斤。
