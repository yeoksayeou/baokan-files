　　Rice Harvest Completed in Southwest Provinces
    Farmers Say: This is a Good Year with Rent Reduction, a Double Blessing.
    [Xinhua News Agency News] The 45 million mu of rice fields in the Sichuan area of ​​Southwest China have now been harvested.
    In the Eastern Sichuan Administrative Region, 50% of the arable land was planted with rice this year, surpassing last year's record, and the yield also exceeded last year's. In the Western Sichuan area, over 90% of the 8 million mu of rice fields were harvested, with an average yield of 5 shi (a unit of dry measure) of rice per mu, an increase of nearly 400 million jin compared to last year. This year, the rice generally grew well, with an average of about 240 grains per ear, and up to 490 grains at most. Farmers expressed their joy about this year's harvest. Farmers in the suburbs of Chengdu presented a 41-jin giant pumpkin and a 56-jin giant winter melon to the People's Representatives Conference of all circles in Western Sichuan as gifts. Farmer representatives also presented double-eared rice stalks to General Li Jingquan, Director of the Western Sichuan People's Administrative Office. Agricultural product exhibitions were held in Ba County, Beibei, and Huayang, and Huayang County also took photos of excellent varieties and prepared to send them to Chairman Mao.
    After the autumn harvest, the long-desolate rural towns have become lively again. Farmers in the suburbs of small and medium-sized cities such as Bishan in Eastern Sichuan, Neijiang, Rongchang, and Yibin in Southern Sichuan are carrying new grains to the market to exchange for farm tools, towels, and homespun cloth. According to a survey of more than 1,300 households in the fifth and seventh districts of suburban Chongqing, more than 480 households have added farm tools, and more than 130 households have bought cattle and fertilizers. Farmer Ye Maoyun bought a cow and said: "I feel unspeakably happy driving it to plow the fields." A farmer in suburban Chongqing said: "This year's good harvest is not only due to the even rainfall and the help of the People's Government, but especially since the promulgation of the rent reduction regulations, we have had a reassurance, and we are no longer afraid of landlords seizing tenants and increasing rents, so we are more efficient in working and harvesting." Public opinion is: "This year is a good year, and rent is being reduced again, it's a double blessing."
    The harvest in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang provinces has also been completed, and farmers are working hard to engage in the autumn plowing and sowing campaign.

　　西南各省稻田收割完毕
    农民说：今年好年景，又减租了，是个双喜年。
    【新华社讯】西南四川地区今年四千五百万亩水稻，现已收割完毕。
    在川东行政区，今年有百分之五十的耕地面积种水稻，超过了去年的纪录，产量也超过去年。川西区八百万亩水稻，有九成以上的收成，每亩平均可收稻谷五市石，较去年增产近四亿斤。今年稻谷一般长得较好，每穗平均有二百四十粒左右，最高达四百九十粒。农民对于今年年景表示喜悦。成都郊区农民拿着四十一斤的大南瓜与五十六斤的大东瓜送给川西各界人民代表会议作为献礼。农民代表并将双穗稻谷献给川西人民行署主任李井泉将军。在巴县、北碚和华阳，举行了农产品展览会，华阳县并把优良品种摄成照片，准备寄给毛主席。
    秋收后，长期冷落的农村市镇，已经热闹起来。川东璧山，川南内江、荣昌、宜宾等中小城市的郊区农民，都背着新谷上市，换回农具、毛巾和土布。据调查重庆郊区第五、七两区一千三百多户居民当中，有四百八十多户添置了农具，一百三十多户买了耕牛和肥料。农民叶茂云买了一头牛，他说：赶着它犁田，心里有说不出的愉快。重庆郊区一农民说：今年年成好，除了由于雨水调匀和人民政府帮助以外，特别是自从减租条例公布后，我们就有了定心丸，不再怕地主夺佃加租，干活打谷子手都利落了。民间的舆论是：今年好年景，又要减租，是个双喜年。
    云南、贵州、西康三省收割亦告完毕，农民正紧张地投入秋耕秋种运动中。
