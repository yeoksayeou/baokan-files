    The Korean People's Accusation
    A Record of the Korean Documentary "An Appeal to All Conscientious People of the World"
    By Our Correspondent Liang Tian
    We had the opportunity to see a short film shot on location in Korea, reporting on the situation in Korea around June 25th. This is a true film, a powerful piece of evidence and accusation against American imperialism's aggression against Korea for the people of the world.
    Who started the Korean civil war? The film tells us who the culprit is. The American film seized by the Korean People's Army in Seoul begins. Look! The American "envoy," the notorious warmonger Dulles, and some American generals emerge from the hatch of a giant plane. The traitor Syngman Rhee basely welcomes his masters. They gather together beside the "Northward Expedition Strategic Map," pointing with their fingers. Then, the American "envoy" and generals, accompanied by South Korean puppet military officers, climb into the trenches of the "38th Parallel." How pleased is Dulles' fleshy, sinister face! He leans against the parapet, taking out binoculars and looking north. The camera points to the north, where there are peaceful villages, quiet valleys, and fields. Dulles' mouth moves, saying something. This is how enthusiastically the American "envoy" and generals climbed in and out of the trenches of the "38th Parallel."
    In order to launch the civil war, the Syngman Rhee gang, following the orders of their American masters, massively slaughtered Korean patriotic and democratic elements. The real film then shows people: at the foot of the mountain, rows of wooden stakes with groups of Korean patriots tied to them, ready to be shot; a Korean woman with a shooting target paper on her chest, bleeding from the front and back, being untied from the pillar. How many mass graves are in the wilderness! The massacred bodies, their hands tied with wire, a pile here, a patch there! A mother arrives, searching with tearful eyes for her murdered son. She lifts one, then another! She finds him. The mother faints from crying. Those who came with her help her wrap her son's body in a cloth and carry him home! Beside the pit, there are other mothers and relatives searching!
    June 25th, a day that the Korean people and all peace-loving people in the world will never forget, has arrived.
    Following the Syngman Rhee gang's "Northward Expedition" gunshots, groups of American planes dropped bombs on peaceful cities and villages that had no military facilities. No matter where it was, and no matter who lived and resided here, they were all targets of the American beasts' slaughter. Look! The hospital with the clearly visible Red Cross symbol is bombed into ruins, medicine bottles and equipment are scattered on the ground; isn't the pointed bell tower of the Christian church very obvious? But American planes bombed it to leave only a corner of the building. Nurseries, workers' clubs, elementary school classrooms, middle school classrooms, university laboratories, these are also the "enemies" of the American robbers, and they are buried in the sea of fire. Farmers in the fields, ox carts at the village entrance, fishing boats, textile factories producing cloth... none of them can escape the pursuit and slaughter of American planes!
    Burning on the streets, beside the houses, in the corners of the houses, women, children, and old people who were bombed to death are curled up! Blood, blood, flows from their bodies onto their own land, patch after patch! Wounded babies move their little hands and feet, boys and girls cry toward the burnt houses and the corpses of their bombed parents... One city after another is bombed by American murderers into a sea of fire, into a bloody cave!
    The film's conclusion tells people: "Such terror and slaughter are being carried out and increased widely in Korea every minute without interruption."
    This is powerful evidence, a powerful accusation! This bloody record will be shown to peace-loving people of all nations around the world, and will be shown to the world's fair court of honor. It demands the prompt trial of the American Truman administration and its accomplices. It tells everyone: "What is the Korean people fighting for?" It also makes a request to every conscientious person: If these American executioners are not stopped, peace-loving people all over the world will not be at peace.

    朝鲜人民的控诉
    记朝鲜“告全世界有良心的人们”记录片
    本报记者  梁田
    我们有机会看到在朝鲜实地摄录的报道六月二十五日前后朝鲜情况的一部短片。这是一部真实的影片，是向全世界人民对美国帝国主义侵略朝鲜的有力的证据和控诉。
    朝鲜的内战是谁发动的呢？影片告诉我们，谁是罪魁。朝鲜人民军在汉城缴获的美国影片开动了。看吧！美国的“特使”，著名战争贩子杜勒斯和一些美国将军们从巨型飞机的舱口走出来了。卖国贼李承晚卑鄙地欢迎他的主子。他们一起聚集在“北伐战略地图”旁边用手指划着。然后，美国的“特使”和将军们，便由南朝鲜傀儡军官陪同爬进了“三八线”的战壕里。杜勒斯的多肉的阴险的脸孔是多么得意啊！他倚着胸墙，拿出望远镜向北了望着。镜头指向了北方，那里是和平的村庄，静寂的山谷和原野。杜勒斯的嘴嚅动着，说了些什么。美国的“特使”和将军们就是这样热心地爬进爬出“三八线”的战壕的。
    李承晚匪帮为了发动内战，奉美国主子的命令，大批地屠杀朝鲜的爱国民主分子。真实的影片接着向人们显示了：山脚下一排木桩上绑着成群成群的朝鲜爱国志士，准备枪杀：一个胸口贴着射击靶纸的朝鲜妇女，胸前胸后淌着鲜血，正被纵柱子上解下来。荒野的杀人坑多么多啊！被屠杀的尸体，手被铁丝捆着，这里一堆，那里一片！一位母亲来了，她用着泪眼找寻着她的被杀害的儿子。她掀开一个，又掀开一个！她找到了。母亲哭昏过去了。同来的人帮着她用布单包裹着儿子的尸体抬着回家！土坑旁，又有另外的母亲、亲人们在找寻着！
    六月二十五日，朝鲜人民、全世界爱好和平的人民，永远也不会忘记的日子来了。
    随同李承晚匪帮的“北伐”的枪声，美国的飞机一群一群的向着毫无军事设施的和平城市乡村投弹了。无论是什么地方，也无论是什么人在这里居住着生活着，都是美国野兽们屠杀的对象。看吧！有着显明的红十字标帜的医院被炸成废墟，药瓶、器械狼藉在地上；基督教堂的尖形钟塔不是很明显的吗？但是美国飞机把它炸得只剩下一个楼角。托儿所，工人俱乐部，小学教室，中学课堂，大学的实验室，这些也是美国强盗的“敌人”，它们被埋葬在火海中。田里的农夫，村头的牛车，捕鱼的船只，出产布匹的纺织厂，……都免不掉美国飞机的追逐和屠杀！
    燃烧着街头上、房屋旁边，屋角里蜷伏着被炸死的妇女、孩子和老人！血，血，从他们身上流到自己的土地上，一片，又一片！被炸伤的婴儿伸动着他们的小手小腿，男女儿童向着炸成灰烬的房屋和炸死的父母的尸体哭喊着………一个城市，又一个城市，被美国的杀人犯炸成火海、炸成血窟！
    影片的结语告诉人们：“像这样的恐怖、屠杀正一分钟也不间断地广泛地在朝鲜进行着、增加着。”
    这是有力的证据，有力的控诉！这一血的纪录将向全世界各族爱好和平的人民演出，将向世界公正的荣誉的法庭演出。它要求迅速将美国的杜鲁门政府和他的同谋犯进行审判。它告诉了每一个人：“朝鲜人民为了什么目的作战？”它也向每一个有良心的人提出了要求：不制止这些美国刽子手，全世界爱好和平都不会安宁。
