Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 16th: The first Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party's Shaanxi Military District and Troops Stationed in Shaanxi, lasting thirteen days, concluded on the 7th of this month. The meeting focused on summarizing the year's work on the committee system and political work, and made a resolution to carry out a rectification movement throughout the Party.

　　At the meeting, the representatives enthusiastically discussed Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order issued on National Day and expressed their determination to implement it resolutely. In the discussion, all the representatives more clearly recognized that: American imperialism is frantically expanding its war of aggression in Korea, openly invading our country's territory of Taiwan, attacking our country's northeast airspace, and threatening and undermining world peace. Therefore, the entire army must heighten its vigilance, make full preparations, strengthen national defense construction, and prepare to strike any aggressors who dare to invade our country at any time.

　　The meeting pointed out that under the leadership of the higher-level CCP Party Committee over the past year, the entire army has cooperated with fraternal units to complete the task of liberating Northwest China; then carried out production, bandit suppression, and study tasks, and has now cultivated more than 600,000 mu of land and completed nearly 4 million cubic meters of earth and stone work for the Baoji-Tianshui Railway construction; it has wiped out 30,000 bandits, basically eliminating banditry in the entire province of Shaanxi. Through the winter political rectification movement last year, the entire army has taken another step forward in terms of ideological style and organizational construction.

　　中共陕西军区暨驻陕兵团党代会
    讨论朱总司令国庆节命令准备随时打击美国侵略者
    会议总结了一年来的党委制和政治工作
    【新华社西安十六日电】中国共产党陕西军区暨驻陕兵团首届党代表会议，历时十三日，已于本月七日结束。会议着重总结了一年以来全年的党委制工作和政治工作，并做出全党开展整风运动的决议。
    会上，代表们热烈讨论了朱总司令在国庆节发布的命令，并表示坚决执行。全体代表在讨论中更清楚地认识到：美国帝国主义正在疯狂地扩大侵略朝鲜战争，并公开侵略我国领土台湾，侵袭我国东北领空，威胁和破坏世界和平。因此全军必须提高警惕，进行充分准备，加强国防建设，准备随时打击敢于侵犯我国的侵略者。
    会议指出：一年以来全军在上级中共党委的领导下，配合兄弟部队完成了解放大西北的任务；接着又执行生产、剿匪、学习等任务，目前已垦植六十多万亩土地，完成修筑宝（鸡）天（水）铁路土石方工程近四百万公方；剿灭土匪三万人，基本上肃清了陕西全省的匪患。经过去年冬季政治整训运动，全军又在思想作风及组织建设上提高了一步。
