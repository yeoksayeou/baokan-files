　　Mourning the Great People's Warrior - Comrade Ren Bishi
    Lu Dingyi

    Comrade Ren Bishi—one of the main leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, a close comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao, and a great warrior of the Chinese people—unfortunately passed away due to illness. In the first year of the founding of New China, various enormous construction projects were awaiting commencement, and the fierce flames of the war of aggression ignited by American imperialism in Korea were awaiting extinction. At such a time, the passing of Comrade Ren Bishi, a leader who had undergone severe tests, was rich in experience, and possessed great prestige among the people, is undoubtedly a great loss, a sorrowful loss, for the Chinese people.

    Comrade Bishi was one of the earliest members and organizers of the Chinese Communist Party. I met him in 1926. From then until his death, I worked with him on four occasions. During those times, he was my leader, my comrade, and my teacher.

    Throughout Comrade Bishi's life, the most profound impression on me was his political principle. Comrade Bishi was a very gentle person, rarely having moments of "harsh words and stern expressions." However, at critical junctures of the revolution, his position was firm, and he never bowed to opportunism. He persuaded all comrades with reason, enabling them to awaken and unite to oppose opportunism and safeguard the unity of the revolutionary party—the Communist Party. Comrade Bishi's contributions in the 1927 struggle in Wuhan against Chen Duxiu's opportunism, in the struggle against the "vanguardism" tendency in the Communist Youth League at the end of the same year in Shanghai, and in the 1936 struggle against the traitor Zhang Guotao are worthy of eternal commemoration.

    In the summer of 1927, Chen Duxiu's opportunistic errors had already formed a capitulationist line that endangered the revolutionary movement. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek's faction in the Kuomintang had openly colluded with imperialism, betrayed the revolution, and massacred Communist Party members and revolutionary masses, raising the banner of counter-revolution. The Wang Jingwei faction in the Wuhan government was also preparing to surrender to imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, so they opposed the revolutionary workers' movement and peasants' movement under the pretext of being "excessive." Only two paths were placed before the revolutionary movement: either to make unlimited concessions to the Wang Jingwei faction, which would be to abolish the revolution and surrender to imperialism and the reactionaries, which was the essence of Chen Duxiu's capitulationist line; or to develop the workers' revolutionary movement, especially to develop the peasants' land revolution movement, to organize and expand the armed forces led by the Communist Party that were completely loyal and reliable to the revolution, and, based on the great strength of the workers and peasants, to unite all progressive and intermediate elements in the Wuhan government to oppose imperialism, the Northern Warlords, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and the counter-revolutionary elements within the Wuhan government. This was the correct line of the Party. Comrade Ren Bishi was one of the outstanding representatives of this correct revolutionary line. Under the leadership of Comrade Ren Bishi, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League passed a political opinion paper and submitted it to the Party Central Committee. On the eve of Wang Jingwei's betrayal, Chen Duxiu convened an emergency meeting of the Party in Wuchang, and Comrade Bishi read this opinion paper at the meeting. The capitulationist Chen Duxiu rebuked Comrade Bishi and tore up the opinion paper on the spot. Although this struggle did not save the revolution from failure, it played a significant role in the continued perseverance of the revolutionary struggle after the revolution failed.

    Due to the Communist Youth League's contributions in the struggle against Chen Duxiu's opportunism, a "vanguardism" error tendency arose among some leading comrades of the Youth League at that time. There should only be one vanguard of the working class, the leader of the people's revolution, and that is the Communist Party, and the Communist Youth League should be under the leadership of the Party and act as the Party's assistant. The "vanguardism" or "second party" tendency would make the Youth League also a party like the Communist Party, which would violate the basic principles of Leninism on Party building. This basic principle is: "The Party is not only an organized detachment but also the 'highest form of organization' that transcends all other organizations of the working class, whose mission is to lead all other organizations of the working class." (History of the CPSU (B)) Violating this basic principle would inevitably lead to narrowing and lowering the Party's leading role, weakening the proletariat and disarming it, and the Youth League's own door-closingism (or sectarianism) towards the broad masses of young people, which would be very detrimental to the revolutionary movement. At the end of 1927, the Central Committee of the Youth League, with Comrade Bishi as its secretary, waged a struggle against this "vanguardism" tendency. This struggle is very important in the history of the youth movement of our revolution.

    From 1934 to 1936, China's revolution faced another serious juncture. Japanese imperialism had already occupied the Northeast, and the anti-Japanese movement was seething throughout the country. However, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang was determined to sell out the country and, under the reactionary slogan of "first pacify the interior before resisting foreign aggression," attacked the people, concentrating one million troops to carry out the so-called "five encirclement and suppression" campaigns. The main forces of the people's army—the First, Second, and Fourth Front Armies of the Red Army—marched to northern Shaanxi through the 25,000-li Long March. During this difficult time, Zhang Guotao, who later openly became a traitor, launched a secessionist movement, opposed the Party Central Committee, and forcibly kept Comrade Zhu De, the commander-in-chief of the Red Army, and other comrades and part of the troops in the Ganzi area. At that time, due to the disruption of transportation, the leading comrades of the Second Front Army were unable to know Zhang Guotao's anti-Party and counter-revolutionary conspiracy. In June 1936, the Second Front Army arrived in Xikang and joined forces with the Fourth Front Army. The traitor Zhang Guotao attempted to incite the Second Front Army to oppose the Central Committee. Comrade Bishi, who was then the political commissar of the Second Front Army, under his leadership and that of Comrades Zhu De, He Long, and Guan Xiangying, defeated Zhang Guotao's conspiracy, enabling the correct line of the Party represented by Chairman Mao to be supported by the comrades of the Second and Fourth Front Armies. The First, Second, and Fourth Front Armies were finally able to meet in northern Shaanxi, strengthening the revolutionary forces and promoting the War of Resistance Against Japan. Comrade Bishi's leadership made a great contribution.

    Another characteristic of Comrade Bishi was his excellent style of not being afraid of trouble and being good at investigating, studying, and solving problems. This style made him a leader beloved by the entire Party and army. Comrade Bishi has assumed important responsibilities in the construction of the Youth League, in the construction of the Party, in the construction of revolutionary base areas, and in the construction of the people's army. These construction works were very difficult, and many complicated and troublesome problems had to be encountered. The leader must be good at correctly solving these problems. Comrade Bishi is an example of such a leader. Anyone who has read Comrade Bishi's article "Several Problems in the Land Reform" written in January 1948 can know that Comrade Bishi thoroughly studied many relevant facts and documents, analyzed them, and then solved many important principled problems in the land reform so thoroughly and advanced the theory of land reform. Comrade Bishi has handled many major issues of the Party and the state and written many documents. Just giving this one example can show how he handled everything with a responsible attitude and meticulous research.

    Comrade Bishi has been imprisoned twice, experienced revolutionary highs and lows, and experienced such turbulent waves as the Long March. His virtues were his unyielding strength against the enemy, his resolute struggle against opportunism, his refusal to bow to difficulties, and his infinite loyalty to the people. The great warrior of the people, Comrade Ren Bishi, was a Marxist-Leninist, a person who was extremely accomplished in the theory of Marxism-Leninism and could use it to solve the problems of China's liberation.

    Thirty years of unremitting and intense struggle caused Comrade Bishi to suffer from high blood pressure from the end of 1947. But he still insisted on working until he had to rest last April. After resting for a year and two months, he returned to his work post. On the 18th of this month, at the banquet given by the Party Central Committee for the World Youth Delegation, he also told me that his weight had decreased and his blood pressure had lowered, and he was very optimistic about his health. Who knew that a conversation would become a final farewell. On the 26th, I received the news of his cerebral hemorrhage. When I went to see him again, he was already unconscious, and on the 27th, he passed away!

    The Party Central Committee calls on us: "Learn from the example of Comrade Ren Bishi, unite as one, and strive to oppose the aggression of American imperialism, consolidate the national defense of the people's motherland, and continue to develop the people's revolutionary struggle and the people's construction cause."

    We will definitely do our best to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, learn from his example, and fulfill his legacy! Rest in peace, dear Comrade Bishi!

　　痛悼伟大的人民战士——任弼时同志
    陆定一
    任弼时同志——中国共产党的主要领导者之一，毛主席的亲密战友，中国人民伟大的战士，不幸因病逝世了。新中国开国一年，各种巨大的建设工作正待举办，美国帝国主义在朝鲜所燃起的侵略战争的凶焰正待扑灭，在这样的时候，一个经过严重考验的、富有经验的、在人民大众中具有巨大威信的领导者——任弼时同志的逝世，对中国人民来说，无疑地是巨大的损失，悲痛的损失。
    弼时同志是中国共产党最早的党员和组织家之一。我认识他，是在一九二六年。从那时起，一直到他逝世为止，曾经四度在一起工作。在这些时间里，他是我的领导者，我的同志和我的先生。
    弼时同志一生，对于我印象最深刻的，是他在政治上的原则性。弼时同志是很温和的人，很少有“疾言厉色”的时候。但是在革命的紧要关头，他的立场是坚定的，是从来不向机会主义低头的，他把道理说服所有的同志，使同志们觉悟起来，团结起来，反对机会主义，保障革命政党——共产党的统一。一九二七年在武汉反对陈独秀机会主义的斗争，同年年底在上海反对共产主义青年团中“先锋主义”倾向的斗争，一九三六年反对叛徒张国焘的斗争，弼时同志在这中间的功绩，是值得永远纪念的。
    一九二七年夏，陈独秀的机会主义错误已经形成为危害革命运动的投降主义路线。当时，国民党中蒋介石一派已经公开勾结帝国主义，叛变革命，屠杀共产党员和革命群众，揭起了反革命的旗帜。在武汉政府中的汪精卫一派，也已经准备向帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮投降，所以用“过火”为罪名反对革命的工人运动和农民运动。放在革命运动面前的只有两条路：或者是对汪精卫一派作无限制的让步，这就是取消革命，向帝国主义和反动派投降，这就是陈独秀投降主义路线的实质；或者是发展工人的革命运动，特别是发展农民的土地革命运动，组织和扩大由共产党所领导的对革命完全忠实可靠的武装力量，以伟大的工农的力量为基础，团结武汉政府中一切进步的和中间的分子，反对帝国主义、北洋军阀、蒋介石匪帮和武汉政府内的反革命分子，这就是党的正确路线。任弼时同志就是这种正确的革命路线的杰出代表之一。在任弼时同志的领导下，共产主义青年团的中央曾通过了一个政治意见书，向党的中央提出来。汪精卫叛变的前夜，陈独秀在武昌召集了一次党的紧急会议，弼时同志在会上宣读了这个意见书。投降主义者陈独秀斥责了弼时同志，并当场撕毁了这个意见书。当时所进行的这个斗争，虽然没有能挽救革命的失败，但对于革命失败后革命斗争的继续坚持，是有重大作用的。
    由于青年团在反对陈独秀机会主义的斗争中有了功绩，在当时青年团的一部分领导同志中就产生了“先锋主义”的错误倾向。工人阶级的先锋队，人民革命的领导者，应该只有一个，这就是共产党，而共产主义青年团应该受党的领导，做党的助手。“先锋主义”或者“第二党”倾向，就是使青年团也成为与共产党一样的政党，这就破坏列宁主义关于党的建设的基本原则，这个基本原则就是：“党不只是一个有组织的部队，而且是超出于工人阶级其他一切组织的‘最高组织形式’，其使命是要领导工人阶级其他一切组织。”（联共党史）破坏这个基本原则，必然招致缩小和降低党的领导作用，削弱无产阶级和解除其武装，和青年团自己对广大青年群众的关门主义（或宗派主义），这对于革命运动是很不利的。一九二七年底，以弼时同志为书记的青年团中央，对于这种“先锋主义”倾向作了斗争。这个斗争，在我国革命的青年运动的历史上，是很重要的。
    一九三四年到一九三六年，曾是中国革命的另一严重关头。日本帝国主义已经占领东北，全国沸腾着抗日运动，但是蒋介石匪帮决心卖国，在所谓“攘外必先安内”的反动口号之下，向人民进攻，集中一百万兵力进行所谓“五次围剿”。人民军队——红军的主力，一、二、四三个方面军，经过二万五千里长征，开往陕北。在这艰难困苦的时候，后来公开成为叛徒的张国焘，来了一个分裂运动，反对党中央，并把红军总司令朱德同志和其他一部分同志和一部分部队强留在甘孜地区。当时因为交通断绝，红二方面军的领导同志无法知道张国焘的反党反革命的阴谋。一九三六年六月，二方面军到了西康，与四方面军会合，叛徒张国焘企图煽动二方面军反对中央。弼时同志当时是二方面军的政治委员，在他和朱德同志、贺龙同志、关向应同志等的领导下，战胜了张国焘的阴谋，使毛主席所代表的党的正确路线得到了二方面军和四方面军同志们的拥护。一、二、四方面军终于能在陕北会合，壮大了革命的力量，推动了抗日战争，弼时同志的领导是有很大功绩的。
    弼时同志的另一特点，就是他不怕麻烦和善于调查研究解决问题的优良作风，这种作风使他成为全党全军所热爱的领导者。弼时同志在青年团的建设中，在党的建设中，在革命根据地的建设中，在人民军队的建设中，都担负过重要的责任。这些建设工作是很困难的，要遇到许许多多复杂的麻烦的问题，领导者必须善于正确解决这些问题。弼时同志就是这样的领导者的一个例子。谁只要读过弼时同志在一九四八年一月所写的《土地改革中的几个问题》一文，就可以知道，弼时同志是详细研究了许多有关的事实和文件，加以分析，才能把土地改革中许多重要的原则问题解决得那样透彻，把土地改革的理论推进一步。弼时同志处理过许多党的和国家的重大问题，写过许多文件，只要举出这一个例子来，就可以看见他是以怎样负责的态度和细密的研究来处理一切事情。
    弼时同志曾经两次入狱，曾经经过革命高潮和革命低潮，曾经经过像万里长征那样的惊涛骇浪。对敌人坚强不屈，对机会主义坚决斗争，对困难不低头，对人民无限忠诚，就是他的美德。人民的伟大战士任弼时同志，是马克思列宁主义者，是对于马克思列宁主义的理论极有修养，并能运用它来解放中国问题的人。
    三十年不倦的紧张的奋斗，使弼时同志从一九四七年年底起患高血压症。但他仍坚持工作，到去年四月才不得不休息。休息了一年另两个月，又回到工作岗位上。本月十八日，在党中央宴请世界青年代表团的席上，他还告诉我说他的体重已经减轻，血压已经降低，对于自己的健康很乐观。谁知道一次的谈话，竟成了永诀。二十六日得到他脑出血的消息，再去看他时，他已经昏迷不醒，二十七日竟与世长辞了！
    党中央号召我们：“学习任弼时同志的榜样，团结一致，为反对美帝国主义的侵略，巩固人民祖国的国防，继续发展人民革命斗争和人民建设事业而奋斗。”
    我们必定尽心尽力，响应党中央的号召，学习他的榜样，完成他的遗志！安息吧，亲爱的弼时同志！
