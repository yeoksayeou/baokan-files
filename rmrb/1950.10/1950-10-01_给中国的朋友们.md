　　To My Chinese Friends
    Simonov
    The author of this article is a famous Soviet writer, Stalin Prize winner, representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Deputy Secretary-General of the Soviet Writers' Association, and Deputy Head of the Soviet cultural, artistic and scientific workers delegation that visited China last October.
    —Editor
    It has been exactly one year since we, members of the first Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation to visit China, participated in the great ceremony of the Chinese people in Beijing, a ceremony of great significance to all progressive humanity—the founding ceremony of the People's Republic of China. Although a year has passed, everything that happened on that great day is still presented before our eyes, as if it had just happened today.
    I can now see the streets of Beijing in the early morning, the parade with red flags advancing towards the central square of Beijing (Tiananmen Square—translator), the troops stationed on both sides of the street preparing for the review, the motionless tanks, the rifles set up, and the mortars that seemed to be squatting on the ground with two legs.
    Look at this square again. The crowd is like a sea, no, not a sea, but an ocean. They came here to celebrate the long-awaited festival of liberation, to listen to the glorious words of the announcement read by Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, in which the freedom, independence, and unity of the Chinese people and Chinese territory were eternally announced.
    On this day, there were three colors in the square: the red of the flags, the blue of the workers' uniforms, and the green of the army uniforms.
    I remember when those American cannons captured from the Kuomintang fired salutes, a red flag, the national flag of the People's Republic of China, rose into the blue sky in the rumbling sound. Its solemn and great rise symbolized one of the greatest victories in the history of the people over anti-people forces.
    The happy moment of the National Day ceremony was filled with infinite joy in people's hearts. At this moment, you look at the faces of the people, as if they have forgotten all the pain they experienced before this joy, and all the labor and sacrifices without which victory would not have been possible. At this time, we should observe the heroic faces of the hundreds of thousands of people gathered in the square, on which we can read the long, arduous, and bloody history of the Chinese people's struggle for freedom. But if one thinks of the future, one's eyes will involuntarily turn to the blue workers' uniforms, to the clothes of those who will build and create; and still thinking of the future, one's eyes will turn to the green uniforms of the revolutionary soldiers, without whom the future is unimaginable when imperialism continues to threaten the future.
    The existence of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a guarantee that the enemy will not dare to harm the future of the Chinese people, neither in the future nor now, and will not dare to add their bloody claws to the future of the Chinese people again. Their bloody claws have been nailed by the People's Liberation Army with bayonets on the Northeast Plain, on the battlefield of the Huaihai Campaign, and on the banks of the Yangtze River.
    Today, the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, hundreds of thousands of people representing all the Chinese people will gather in the same square in Beijing. We Soviet people feel a brotherly affection for them. I don't intend to add any adjectives such as great, huge, or strong here. I only say "brotherly," because in Russian, there is no word more powerful than this to express intimate feelings.
    Today, in the same square where my comrades and I were a year ago on the same day, people will gather together, and they have their own work to tell about in the past year. The chimneys of the revived and newly built factories are emitting smoke. In the fields that have become the property of the tillers, abundant rice is maturing. Millions of children are attending new schools. Tens of thousands of young people are studying in universities.
    On this day, I want to feel brotherly joy for their achievements in the past year and congratulate them on new victories in the coming year and all years to come.
    We Soviet people are proud because Chinese comrades, in more than 20 years of armed struggle against foreign imperialism and domestic reactionaries, whether in moments of victory or moments of difficulty, have used, learned from, been inspired by, and strengthened their belief in victory from the experience of the Soviet state, the Soviet people, our Communist Party, our Lenin, and our Stalin. And when I see the festive square in Beijing on this glorious anniversary today, I think I will be right if I say that wherever imperialists are still ravaging foreign lands, in Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and many other countries, wherever people are fighting imperialism, people fighting for freedom everywhere are remembering the experience of the October Revolution, and also remembering the Chinese Communist Party's self-sacrificing struggle for the people's freedom, which finally won victory.
    Today, somewhere in Korea, after fighting with the American interventionists, every soldier of the Korean People's Army will think of the first free anniversary, the first independent anniversary, being celebrated in China at this time. He thinks that China has been free and independent for a year, and this feeling will inspire him to move forward and increase his confidence in victory.
    Now I am very happy to think that my comrades and I had the honor of participating in this grand ceremony a year ago. This memory is one of the most precious memories in my life, because the victory day of the freedom-loving Chinese brother people is not only a festival for the Chinese people, but also a festival for the Soviet people and internationalists.
    I, as a writer, would like to congratulate Chinese cultural workers on their victories in their great creative work on behalf of all the remaining comrades and on behalf of the entire Soviet writing community. This victory is guaranteed because Chinese revolutionary soldiers are defending the independence of the motherland, because all the freedom-loving people in the world and the united and unbreakable camp headed by the Soviet Union are opposing imperialists all over the world.

### 给中国的朋友们

　　给中国的朋友们
    西蒙诺夫
    本文作者是苏联名作家，斯大林奖金获得者，苏联最高苏维埃代表，苏联作家协会副总书记，去年十月来中国访问的苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团副团长。
    ——编者
    从我们、第一个访问中国的苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团的团员们，在北京参加中国人民的伟大典礼，所有进步人类的具有巨大意义的典礼——中华人民共和国开国大典，到现在，正好是一年了。虽然已经过了一年，但是现在在我们的眼前呈现着那个伟大的日子里所发生的一切，就好像这是今天方才发生的一样。
    我现在看见清晨的北京的街道，看见向着北京的中央广场（天安门广场——译者）进发的红旗招展的游行队伍，看见分布在大街两旁准备检阅的军队、屏息不动的坦克、架起来的步枪、以及那好像是依靠着两条腿蹲在地上的迫击炮。
    再看这个广场上吧。人群像个大海，不，不是大海，而是汪洋，他们来到这里庆祝渴望已久的解放节日，来听中国人民领袖毛泽东宣读公告的荣耀的语句，在这个公告里，永远地宣布了中国人民与中国领土的自由、独立和统一。
    在这一天广场上有三种颜色：旗帜的红色、工人服的蓝色、军队制服的绿色。
    我记起来，当用那些从国民党那边缴获来的美国大炮鸣放礼炮的时候，在那隆隆声中，一面红旗，中华人民共和国的国旗，向青色的天空升起，它的庄严伟大的上升，表征了历史上人民战胜反人民力量的、最伟大的胜利中的一次胜利。
    国庆大典的幸福时刻，在人们的心里充满着无限欢欣。在这个时刻，你看人们的脸上，好像他们已经忘掉了那欢乐前所经历的一切痛苦，忘掉了没有它就不可能获得胜利的一切劳动与牺牲。在此时，我们应当观察那聚集在广场上成千成百的人们的英勇的面貌，在那上面可以读出中国人民争取自由的长久、坚苦、流血的斗争历史。但如果是一想到未来，眼光就会不由自主地转向蓝色工人服上去，转向那些将要建设和创造的人们的衣服上去；也还是想到未来，眼光就会转向革命士兵的绿色制服上去，在帝国主义继续威胁着未来的时候，没有他们，未来是不可想像的。
    中国人民解放军的存在就是一个保证，他使敌人将来和现在都不敢损害中国人民的未来，不敢重新再把他们血淋淋的爪子加之于中国人民的未来，他们血淋淋的爪子已经被解放军用枪刺钉在东北平原上、淮海战役的战场上和长江边上了。
    今天，中华人民共和国开国一周年纪念日，在北京的同一个广场上，将聚集起来代表全中国人民的成千成万的人，对于他们，我们苏联人民感受到一种兄弟的感情。我不打算在这里添加任何伟大、巨大、强烈等等形容词儿。我单单只说“兄弟的”，因为在俄文中，表达亲密的情感，再没有比这个词儿更为有力的了。
    今天，就在我和我的同志们一年前同一天所在的同一广场上，人们将聚会在一起，他们有着一年来自己的工作可以说的。兴复起来的工厂和新建的工厂的烟突冒着烟。已经变成了耕者所有的田地里，丰登的稻米在成熟着。千百万的儿童在新学校里上学。成万的青年们在大学里读书。
    在这一天，我要为他们一年来的成就而感到兄弟般的喜悦，并祝贺他们在明年和今后所有的年月里都有新的胜利。
    我们苏联人民感到自豪；因为中国的同志们在二十多年与外国帝国主义和国内反动派的武装斗争中，不论在胜利的时刻，或困难的时刻，都曾利用苏维埃国家、苏维埃人民、我们的共产党、我们的列宁、我们的斯大林的经验，学习这个经验，为这个经验所鼓舞，并增强他们对于胜利的信念。而当今天这个光荣的周年纪念日里，在我看见北京的节日广场的时候，我想，我将是对的，如果我说在任何帝国主义者仍然蹂躏着异国的土地的地方，在朝鲜、越南、印度尼西亚及其他许多国家里，人民正与帝国主义者进行斗争的地方，到处的为自由而战斗的人们，都在记取着十月革命的经验，并也记取着中国共产党为争取人民自由的、自我牺牲的、而最后获得胜利的斗争的经验。
    今天，在朝鲜任何某个地方，在与美国干涉者拚战之后，每一个朝鲜人民军的战士都会想到此时在中国正庆祝着第一个自由的周年纪念日、第一个独立的周年纪念日。他想到中国已经自由和独立一年了，这一股情感就会鼓舞他前进并且提高他对于胜利的信心。
    现在我很高兴想到我和我的同志们有此荣幸在一年前参加这个盛典。这个记忆是留在我一生中的最宝贵的记忆之一，因为爱好自由的中国兄弟人民的胜利日，对于苏联人民及国际主义者来说，这不仅是中国人民的节日，这也是他们的节日。
    我，作为一个作家，愿代表所有其余的同志，代表整个的苏联著作界祝贺中国文化工作者在他们伟大的创造工作中获得胜利。这个胜利是有保证的，因为有中国革命士兵们保卫着祖国的独立，因为有全世界爱好自由的人民与以苏联为首的一致而牢不可破的阵营反对着全世界帝国主义者。
