　　After Reading "Mao Zedong Locomotive"
    Zhao Kaiming
    "Mao Zedong Locomotive" is a novella-length report recently serialized in the People's Daily. On September 8th, I was reading the part about the workers of the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" being disunited, and the leadership calling a cadre meeting. At the meeting, some people advocated that to improve the "Mao Zedong Locomotive," Shang Baoheng and Zheng Dugong, who were causing the disunity, should be transferred away. However, most people believed that transferring them away was not a fundamental solution, and it was necessary to strengthen education and leadership for them, helping them overcome ideological problems and unite them. Therefore, the leadership decided to transfer Comrade Guo Shude, a special-class hero, and asked him to bring two Party members to the locomotive to help with the work. I was just about to see how Comrade Guo Shude would help with the work, how he would unite the workers, how he would carry out persuasion and education, and how the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" would eventually become... But it happened to be suspended for a day, which really made me anxious!
    Why does "Mao Zedong Locomotive" have such a strong attraction? Because on the first day "Mao Zedong Locomotive" was published, the editor made a brief introduction before the text, giving us a preliminary understanding of the "Mao Zedong Locomotive." Then, the report itself tells us that due to the leadership of the Party and the exemplary role of the Party members, the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" took the lead in implementing the contract responsibility system and achieved the greatest running performance. At the same time, it also made us understand that only under the correct leadership of the Party and the patient help of Party member Guo Shude, who was not afraid of difficulties, could Comrade Li Yong's thinking be transformed, and he joined the Party and became a people's hero. At this National Model Workers' Representative Conference, Comrade Li Yong gloriously became a representative.
    I love the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" so much, and it has given me great education. In the past, I always thought that production only needed technology; if the work was not done well and the workers were disunited, what could the Party's leadership and Party members' help do? After reading "Mao Zedong Locomotive," it made me clearly recognize the power of the Party: Comrade Guo Shude made the work of the Mao Zedong Locomotive progress and become a new locomotive model. At the same time, this made me deeply realize the mistakes in my past understanding and recognize that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can we do all work well and achieve great results.

　　读了《毛泽东号》以后
    赵凯明
    《毛泽东号》是最近在人民日报上连载的中篇报告。九月八日，我正读到《毛泽东号》的工友们闹不团结，领导上召开干部会。会上有人主张：要想搞好《毛泽东号》，只有把闹不团结的商宝恒和郑笃恭调走。但大多数人却认为调走不是解决问题的根本办法，而必须加强对他们的教育和领导，帮助他们克服思想上的毛病，使他们团结起来。因此，领导上决定调特等英雄郭树德同志去，并叫他带了两个党员到车上帮助工作。我正要看看郭树德同志怎样地帮助工作，怎样地来团结工友们，怎样地进行说服教育，最后使《毛泽东号》变得怎样了……。但恰巧这时停载一天，真叫我急坏了！
    为什么《毛泽东号》会有这样强烈的吸引力呢？因为在《毛泽东号》发表的第一天，编者便在文前作了一个简单介绍，使我们对《毛泽东号》首先有了一个初步的认识。接着这篇报告本身告诉我们：由于党的领导及党员们的模范作用，使《毛泽东号》带头推行包乘负责制，并获得了最大的跑车成绩。同时它也使我们了解到只有在党的正确领导和党员郭树德不怕困难的耐心帮助下，才能使李永同志的思想得到转变，参加了党，变成了人民的英雄。在这次全国劳模代表会议上，李永同志又光荣地成了代表。
    我是如此地热爱着《毛泽东号》，而它也给了我极大的教育。我在以前，总是认为搞生产只要有技术就行啦；如果工作搞不好，工友们闹不团结，则党的领导、党员的帮助又有什么办法呢？读了《毛泽东号》以后，使我清楚地认识了党的力量：党员郭树德同志使毛泽东号的工作获得了进步，成了新的机车模范。同时，这使我深深地了解到自己过去认识的错误，认清了只有在共产党的领导下，才能搞好一切工作，才能使工作获得巨大的成绩。
