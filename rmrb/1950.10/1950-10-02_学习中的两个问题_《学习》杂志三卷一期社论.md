Two Problems in Learning
    Editorial from "Study" Magazine, Volume 3, Issue 1

    Chairman Mao once said, "Everyone understands that no matter what you do, if you don't understand the situation, its nature, and its relationship with other things, you won't know the laws of that thing, you won't know how to do it, and you won't be able to do it well." This is true of everything, and it should also be true of ideological education and theoretical learning. Ideological education and theoretical learning have their own laws. If we don't understand their specific circumstances and specific nature, we can't do them well.

    Over the past year, the achievements made in ideological education and theoretical learning in schools, institutions, and organizations across the country have been significant. It should be affirmed that the gains are the main aspect. But on the other hand, there are shortcomings. Some of these shortcomings are even quite serious. The basic root of these shortcomings lies in the fact that we have not sufficiently grasped the laws of ideological education and theoretical learning, so that sometimes the guidelines and methods we adopt do not conform to the nature inherent in the development process of ideology and consciousness itself. When we review the work of "Study" magazine over the past year, we find that we have not only failed to promptly point out and correct the shortcomings and deviations that have arisen in the general learning movement, but have instead uncritically introduced and reflected these in this publication, which has objectively had a negative impact on the development of the learning movement in various aspects. This is more pronounced in the following two issues.

    The first is the issue of the "acute illness" in the learning movement.

    In a certain sense, a vigorous learning movement has indeed unfolded on a national scale. As Chairman Mao said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," "Things have developed so rapidly that many people feel surprised and feel the need to relearn." Tens of millions of people have been drawn into this learning of new things and new principles, earnestly carrying out ideological transformation. Overall, this is a huge movement. Moreover, revolution most easily motivates people to learn new things. As China's country and society enter such an unprecedented period of great change, the learning people are undertaking to adapt to this change will achieve results at a greater speed than learning at ordinary times. This is also a certain truth.

    But what is said above is only one aspect of the matter. On the other hand, we must also see that the learning movement and other mass movements, such as the movement to raise public bonds, the movement to provide disaster relief, and the land reform movement, are things that differ greatly in nature. If, in these movements, after the masses are mobilized, a blitzkrieg method can be adopted to achieve results, then in the learning movement involving ideological awareness, one cannot rely on blitzkriegs to achieve quick results. At the same time, self-education and ideological transformation among intellectual masses cannot be applied according to exactly the same laws as ideological education to enlighten class consciousness among workers and peasants. Unawakened workers and peasants, after one or two short training sessions or enlightenment from one or two grievance meetings, may experience a significant increase in their class consciousness; of course, in order to be fully aware, a relatively long-term education process is also required. As for intellectuals, because the vast majority come from non-laboring people's classes and are deeply influenced by the old education, the development of their ideological awareness generally goes through a complex and tortuous process. The rectification movement carried out within the Chinese Communist Party is a movement of ideological transformation carried out within a certain short period, but this is premised on regular ideological education and organizational life within the Party. This method of rectification movement cannot be applied to ideological education among the broad masses outside the Party.

    Over the past year, many universities and middle schools in various places, when conducting political education, have not paid attention to the above-mentioned differences, and have therefore adopted certain rigid and crude methods. Some schools have held ideological summary movements or ideological examination movements; some schools have held "ideological exposure" meetings; and other schools have proposed the name of the "three evaluations" movement; some schools have even attempted to use a scoring method to assess each person's progress in transforming their thinking, and so on. The names are different, and the methods are also different, all using mass mobilization methods to create a short-term mass frenzy, attempting to complete or basically complete the work of ideological transformation in one fell swoop. This kind of "acute illness" approach can at most achieve some superficial results temporarily, but it is unreliable; and it can also lead to results that are contrary to the expected effects.

    The "acute illness" approach is harmful because doing so inevitably carries the flavor of coercion and commandism. Coercion and commandism are harmful in carrying out any mass movement. Coercion and commandism can never achieve the goal of solving ideological problems and raising the level of awareness. Chairman Mao said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" that "it is necessary to 'compel' those who were originally hostile classes" to "undergo" necessary propaganda and education, but that this "cannot be compared with our work of self-education within the revolutionary people." Learning organizations and learning systems in all schools, institutions, and organizations are various favorable and convenient conditions established by the state for the people's self-education, and are not using the power of the state to force people to carry out certain learning. Ideological education within the people's masses can certainly be said to be a manifestation of ideological struggle, but this struggle must be based on voluntary and conscious participation through free discussion and research. If one thinks that since it is a struggle, it is necessary to create a tense battle atmosphere, then it completely violates the essence of ideological education. Facts have proven that in general schools, adopting the method of mass movements to carry out ideological education often results in petty-bourgeois spontaneous fanaticism replacing rational thinking, and heavy threats replacing free discussion, and the educational effect is minimal.

    Under the style of coercion and commandism, various forms of formalism will inevitably arise. Originally, it is possible to conduct summaries and carry out criticism and self-criticism at a certain stage of the learning process. But if it is not based on genuine consciousness, ideological summaries and criticisms will become formalistic. Taking the form of Party rectification and moving it to the masses outside the Party will inevitably be seemingly similar but fundamentally different. Using the scoring method in tests of scientific knowledge has a certain correctness, but if it is used to assess the level of ideological awareness, it will be a futile effort.

    Opposing the "acute illness" in ideological transformation learning should certainly not be used as a weapon by those who refuse ideological transformation and refuse to learn. But we must also point out that for those who refuse ideological transformation and refuse to learn, as long as they do not belong to the reactionary class, we can only adopt a patient and persuasive attitude and constantly enlighten them to move forward. Because this belongs to the issue of ideological awareness, it is always ineffective to hastily adopt other means outside of education.

    The second is the issue of collective learning.

    In learning, the relationship between collective and individual is a problem that is often confused in practice.

    As mentioned earlier, learning has become a movement throughout the country, and the existence of such a vast team of learners has become a force to encourage everyone in this team to double their efforts. On a smaller scale, a collective of learners is also formed in a school, institution, or organization. Everyone seeks appropriate "study buddies" in learning in order to question and discuss with each other. This is all a manifestation of the collectivity of learning. This is certainly much better than learning alone for ten years in a window, oblivious to the world. But here, it must never be forgotten that learning is ultimately everyone's own business. The collective team of learners is composed of each individual who strives to learn. We sometimes almost forget this simple thing.

    Schools are where the collectivity of learning is most strongly manifested. Students in the same class simultaneously learn the same subjects and read the same textbooks according to the same schedule. But every student must still conduct self-study individually outside of class. The methods of self-study can be different, the focus of self-study for various subjects can be different, and experienced teachers guide each student to read different reference books. Doing so is possible and reasonable. Because among all students, it is impossible to be completely consistent in all aspects, nor should they be forced to be completely consistent.

    The situation in an institution or organization is much more complex than in a school. There is consistency in the overall direction in learning, but cultural level, level of awareness, ideological level, and other aspects may all be different. Among them, they can be organized in an appropriate way into collectives for common learning, mutual discussion, and mutual assistance, but since this collective is composed of people who are different from each other, each person should carry out their own learning based on their own cultural level, level of awareness, and ideological level. Only such learning is truly beneficial. Of course, this does not mean that it is not possible to assign the same learning content to some people with basically the same conditions and needs, but just as in schools, even if the basic content learned is the same, everyone should still be encouraged to adopt different methods that are most habitual and suitable for them, read different reference books, and study certain different related issues. If everything is forced to be the same, it is precisely a misunderstanding of the meaning of the collective.

    Some people also limit the meaning of collective learning to group discussions. This phenomenon has appeared in many learning organizations, with too much emphasis on arranging group discussions and too little encouragement for each person to read seriously. As a result, group discussions become empty talk, and the more empty talk, the more it is considered a sign of better learning. The role of group discussions in learning is actually only to inspire each other ideologically and exchange learning insights and experiences. Exceeding its ability to play a role and using the method of group discussion is only enough to become an obstacle to learning progress.

    Group discussion is not the basic method for conducting learning. In some cases, lecturing is the basic method of learning, and in some cases, self-study is the basic method of learning. Group discussion can only be a supplementary method. Only after we have attended classes well and conducted self-study well can they need to conduct appropriate group discussions. And even if we have no group discussions at all, we can still have individual contact, discuss with each other, and study together, and we will still receive the benefits of collective learning. Therefore, if we think that group discussion is the collective learning, and even the only and basic method of learning, we are putting a shackle on ourselves, making ourselves stumble very difficultly on the learning journey. – This painful experience has been had in many learning organizations.

    In the past year, "Study" magazine has very inappropriately published experiences of learning as mass struggles in ordinary schools, and has also inappropriately emphasized the significance of collective learning and group discussion in various articles. Therefore, we specifically raise these two issues here as our self-criticism, and also hope to attract everyone's attention and discussion.

　　学习中的两个问题
    《学习》杂志三卷一期社论
    毛主席曾说，“大家明白，不论做什么事，不懂得那件事的情形，它的性质，它与以外事情的关联，就不知道那件事的规律，就不知道如何去做，就不能做好那件事。”一切事都是这样，为做好思想教育与理论学习也应该是这样。思想教育与理论学习有其自身的规律，如果不懂得它的特殊情形，特殊性质，也是办不好的。
    这一年来，在全国各学校、机关、团体中，进行思想教育和理论学习，所取得的成绩是很显著的。应该肯定，成绩的收获是主要的一方面。但另一方面，并不是没有缺点。有的缺点甚至还是很严重地存在着。产生这些缺点的基本根源就在于我们对于思想教育与理论学习的规律还没有足够地掌握，以至有时我们所采取的方针和办法不符合于思想意识的发展过程本身所具有的性质。当我们检查“学习”杂志一年来的工作时，发觉我们不但没有能及时指出和纠正在一般学习运动中产生的缺点与偏向，反而曾在这刊物上无批判地介绍和反映了这些，客观上对各方面学习运动的开展起了不好的影响。这在下列两个问题上是比较显著的。
    第一是关于学习运动中的急性病的问题。
    从一定的意义上说，的确已经在全国范围内展开了一个轰轰烈烈的学习运动。如同毛主席在“论人民民主专政”中说的，“事变是发展得这样快，以至使很多人感到突然，感到要重新学习。”上千万人卷进了这种对于新事物，新道理的学习中，认真地进行思想改造，整个看来，正是一个巨大的运动。而且革命是最容易推动人们学会新的东西的，在中国的国家和社会进入这样一种空前的大变化的过程中，人们适应这种变化而进行的学习比在平常时候的学习会以较大的速度而取得成效。这也是一定的道理。
    但上面所说的只是事情的一方面。另一方面，我们又必须看到，学习运动和其他的各种群众运动，例如募集公债的运动、救灾的运动、土地改革的运动，是在性质上有很大差别的事情。如果说，在这些运动中，当群众发动起来之后，可以采取突击式的方法而收到成效，那么在涉及思想觉悟问题的学习运动中，就不能依靠突击而速成。同时，在知识分子群众中进行自我教育和思想改造，和在工人与农民群众中进行启发其阶级觉悟的思想教育，也不能适用完全相同的规律。尚未觉悟的工人与农民，经过一两次短期训练或者在一两次诉苦大会的启发以后，其阶级觉悟就可能显著地提高；当然，为了充分觉悟，也还需要比较长期的教育过程。至于知识分子，因为绝大多数出身于非劳动人民的阶级，并且深受旧教育的影响，其思想觉悟的发展一般地要通过复杂的曲折的过程。在中国共产党内进行的整风运动，是在一定的短时期内进行的思想改造的运动，但这是以党内的经常的思想教育和组织生活为前提的。这种整风运动的方式对于党外的广大群众中的思想教育也就不能适用。
    一年来，各地有不少的大学和中学，进行政治教育时，没有注意到上述的种种区别，因而采取了某些生硬的、粗暴的方式。有的学校举行了思想总结运动或思想检查运动；有的学校开了暴露思想大会；又有学校提出了三评运动的名目；也有些学校企图用记分的方法来评定每一个人在改造思想上所到达的成绩等等。名目不同，办法也各不同，都是用群众鼓动的方法来造成一个短期间的群众热潮，而企图一举完成或基本上完成思想改造的工作。这种急性病的做法，最多只能一时地表面地收到若干成效，然而是不可靠的；而且还会酿成与预期成效相反的结果。
    急性病的做法之所以有害，因为这样做，就不可免地带有强迫命令的气味。强迫命令在进行任何性质的群众运动中，都是有害的。强迫命令更绝不能达到解决思想问题、提高觉悟程度的目的。毛主席在“论人民民主专政”中曾说，对于“原来是敌对阶级的人们”，是应该“强迫施行”必要的宣传教育的，而这“和我们对于革命人民内部的自我教育工作不能相提并论”。一切学校、机关、团体中的学习组织和学习制度是国家为人民的自我教育设立了各种有利的、方便的条件，而并不是用国家的权力来强迫人民进行一定的学习。人民群众内部的思想教育固然也可以说是思想斗争的一种表现，但这种斗争一定要以自愿自觉为基础通过自由的讨论研究来进行。如果以为既然是斗争，就必须造成一种紧张的战斗空气，那就完全违反了思想教育的本旨。事实证明，在一般学校中，采用群众运动的方式来进行思想教育，其结果，往往使得小资产阶级自发的狂热代替了理性的思考，沉重的威胁代替了自由的讨论，所收到的教育的效果是很少的。
    在强迫命令的作风下，不可免地会产生种种形式主义的做法。本来，在学习过程到了一定阶段，进行总结本来是可以的，进行批评与自我批评也是必要的。但如果不是以真正的自觉为基础，思想性的总结与批评就会成为形式主义的东西。拿党内整风的形式搬到党外群众中去，结果也一定是貌似而神非。把记分数的方法用在科学知识的测验上有其一定的正确性，但如果用来评定思想觉悟的水平，就是劳而无功的了。
    反对思想改造的学习中的急性病，当然不能为拒绝思想改造，拒绝学习的人用来做武器。但我们也必须指出，对于拒绝思想改造、拒绝学习的人，只要他不属于反动阶级，我们也还是只能采取循循善诱的态度，不断地启发他前进。因为这是属于思想觉悟的问题，性急地采取在教育以外的别的手段总是无效的。
    第二是关于集体学习的问题。
    在学习中，集体与个人的关系是在实际上常常混淆了的问题。
    前面说，学习在整个国家中已成为一个运动，在进行学习的是十分广大的队伍，这样广大的队伍的存在成为推动在这队伍中的每一个人加倍努力的力量。就小范围说，在一个学校，一个机关团体中也形成了一个学习的集体。每一个人在学习中都寻求适当的“学友”，以便互相质疑问难。这都是学习的集体性的表现。这比孤零零一个人十年窗下与世无涉的学习当然是好得多的。但是在这里，绝不能忘记的是，学习到底是每个人自己的事情。学习的集体队伍是要靠每一个各别地努力进行学习的人来构成的。对于这样的一个简单的事情，有时我们几乎的确是忘记了。
    学校是学习的集体性表现得最强的地方。同一班的学生同时照同样的进程学同样的科目，读同样的课本。但是每一个学生在课外仍须各别地进行自修。各人自修的方法可以有区别，对各种功课自修的重点可以不同，有经验的教师指导每个学生阅读不同的参考书。这样做，是可以的，而且是合理的。因为在所有的学生之间，是不可能在各方面完全一致，也不应该勉强使其完全一致的。
    在一个机关或团体里的情形比在学校里复杂得多。在学习中的总的方向上是一致的，但文化水平，觉悟程度与思想水平以及其他方面都可能是各各不同。在他们之间，可以用适当的方式组成为共同学习，互相切磋，互相帮助的集体，但这集体既然由互有不同的人组成，则每一个人都应该是在他自己的文化水平，觉悟程度与思想水平的基础上进行其自己的学习。只有这样的学习才是真正有益的。当然，这并不是说，不可以对于大体上各种条件和需要相同的一些人布置同样的学习内容，但是也正如同在学校中一样，尽管所学的基本内容相同，还是应该鼓励每一个人采用对他最习惯最合适的不同方式，阅读不同的参考书，研究某些不同的有关问题。如果一切都强求其同，那恰恰是误解了集体的意义。
    有人又把集体学习的意义限制为小组讨论。许多学习组织中出现了这种现象，太多地去布置小组讨论，而太少地鼓励每个人认真读书。结果，小组讨论成为空谈，空话说得愈多反被认为学习愈好的表现。小组讨论在学习中的作用其实只在于互相在思想上启发，互相交换学习的心得与经验。超过其所能起的作用而运用小组讨论的方式，只足以成为学习进展的障碍。
    小组讨论并不是进行学习的基本方式。在有些情形下，上课是学习的基本方式，在有些情形下，自修是学习的基本方式。小组讨论只能是一种辅助的方式。只有在我们很好地上了课，很好地进行了自修之后，他们才需要适当进行小组讨论。而且即使我们完全没有小组讨论，我们仍可以个别接触，互相讨论，共同研究，我们就仍旧是收到了集体学习的好处。因此，如果认为小组讨论是集体学习的，乃至学习的唯一的、基本的方式，我们就是给自己套上了一个枷锁，使自己在学习路程中非常艰难地蹒跚而进。——这种痛苦的经验，在许多学习组织中都是有过的了。
    在一年来的“学习”杂志中，曾经很不适当地发表了有关普通学校中的作为群众斗争而进行的学习经验，也曾在各种文章中不适当地强调了集体学习和小组讨论的意义。因此我们在这里特别提出这两个问题来，作为我们的自我批评，也希望引起大家的注意和讨论。
