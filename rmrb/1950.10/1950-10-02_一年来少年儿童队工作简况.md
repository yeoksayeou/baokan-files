The organization of Chinese Young Pioneers has a history of over twenty years. During the Great Revolution, there were Labor Children's Corps; during the Land Revolution, there were Young Pioneers and Children's Corps; during the Anti-Japanese War, there were Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard and Anti-Japanese Children's Corps. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League, these children's organizations undertook certain political, military, and production tasks, such as: standing guard, eliminating traitors and preventing espionage, delivering letters, breaking superstitions, banning opium and gambling, conducting revolutionary propaganda activities, and assisting production. They assisted the people in revolutionary base areas and liberated areas in fighting against the enemy and engaging in production struggles, earning the praise of the broad masses.

In January 1949, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in its resolution on establishing the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, pointed out that the League should send its best cadres to lead the work of young pioneers. In October of the same year, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League issued a resolution to establish the Chinese Young Pioneers. This nationally unified organization of young pioneers, inheriting the glorious historical traditions of past children's organizations, has taken on the task of uniting and educating the broad masses of young pioneers in the new situation of the newly established New China.

The task of the Young Pioneers is to unite and educate the broad masses of young pioneers under the leadership of the Communist Youth League, in learning and various collective activities, and to cultivate them into outstanding children of New China with rich cultural and scientific knowledge, healthy physiques, and the "Five Loves" virtues.

More than 1.5 Million Members Nationwide

Over the past year, the work of the Young Pioneers has been fruitful. Currently, there are more than 1.5 million members nationwide. The Young Pioneers are loved by the broad masses of young pioneers and are praised by administrators, teachers, parents, and the people.

In schools, the Young Pioneers enrich and deepen the content of classroom knowledge by combining textbook knowledge with practical knowledge through activities such as visiting factories, collecting specimens, making models, as well as various gatherings and games. For example: visiting factories for making paper, printing, glass, and lime, visiting telephone and telegraph bureaus and railway stations, allows young pioneers to see how workers turn waste paper and rags into snow-white paper and how books and periodicals are printed and glass utensils are manufactured. Students say: "In the past, when teachers talked about how to make lime, I was never very clear, but now after the workers explained it, I feel it is both clear and concrete." The Young Pioneers of Beijing Yu Ying Middle School organized a specimen collection and production group, and under the guidance of the botany teacher, they made a total of more than 200 kinds of animal specimens and more than 80 kinds of plant specimens. In the past, everyone memorized textbooks for botany class. This changed the learning method of botany class. During exams, students would review their lessons in the garden, looking at tomatoes and sunflowers. This greatly increased students' interest in nature and improved their academic performance. In the past, 50 out of 300 people failed, now only a few people fail, and more than one-fifth score above 90 points. The labor group of the Sixth District Central Primary School team in Tianjin used iron sheets and wood chips to create automatic machines, and compared them with the automatic machines in the textbooks, deepening their understanding of the principles of automatic machines. They are currently creating their own internal combustion engine. A squadron of the fifth grade of the Tenth District Demonstration Primary School has a performance exhibition room, displaying small models of steam engines, slide projectors, cameras, and other items made by the members themselves using tin cans, wood chips, and cardboard boxes. These activities inspired their scientific interests and cultivated their creativity. In addition, they turned difficult and educational texts into short plays to perform for their classmates; held interesting "White-Bearded Old Man" meetings to answer various questions; combined with nature class, they turned knowledge of summer hygiene—typhoid, dysentery, cholera—into short plays, and used poetry, dance, and other means to promote health education; and used games such as doing math problems, catching typos, and piecing together maps to help with memory and stimulate interest. Liu Youtang, a fifth-grade student at the Sixth District Central Primary School in Tianjin, used to score zero in arithmetic. Later, he participated in the arithmetic group organized by the Young Pioneers. Through doing arithmetic games and intelligence tests, his arithmetic scores now consistently score above 70 points, and sometimes even 100 points. Through these activities combined with regular classes, the academic performance of the members and classmates has improved significantly.

Members Take the Lead and Academic Performance Improves Universally

The academic performance of the members is generally excellent. For example, among the 240 members of Beijing Normal University Affiliated Girls' Middle School, 205 scored above 80 points. Among the 65 best students in the first semester of Yangzhou Qionghuaguan Primary School, 55 were members. Members not only study hard themselves, but also help non-members to study. For example: Before the establishment of the team in Yanbei Guanglingcheng Primary School, 25% of the students failed the monthly exams. After the establishment of the team, with the leadership and help of the members, the number of students failing the May monthly exams decreased to 10%. Zhang Guihua, a 13-year-old member of the fourth grade of Shenyang Yumin Primary School, always ranks first in academic performance. He also helps his classmates Ji Youxian and Cao Zhenyu review their lessons, raising their scores from the 60s to the 80s. Member Jiang Guiyun helped Cao Zhensheng, increasing his overall average score by more than ten points. Cao Zhensheng's parents wrote to the school saying: "In the past, he would put down his schoolbag and go play when he came home, but now he knows to study hard and his academic performance has improved. This is all thanks to the Young Pioneers."

In addition, without hindering regular classes, the Young Pioneers carried out some activities to strengthen political and ideological education, such as visiting history museums, martyrs' memorial halls, war achievements exhibitions, visiting the rural life after land reform, and the Soviet children's life photo exhibition, meeting with combat heroes and model workers, celebrating with the People's Liberation Army, and holding story meetings and forums such as "Mao Zedong," "Lenin," and "My Most Respected Hero." Using these methods suitable for children's characteristics, the Young Pioneers carried out lively and vigorous patriotic education and internationalist education, cultivating the "Five Loves" qualities of young pioneers. Members and young pioneers all love their great leader Chairman Mao and the great revolutionary teacher of the world people, Marshal Stalin. They wrote many letters to Chairman Mao, reporting their studies and progress. In some gatherings, they wholeheartedly shouted "Long live Stalin!"

Consciousness of Members and Non-Member Young Pioneers Continues to Improve

Under the education of the team, the members' consciousness is constantly improving, which has also promoted great progress among non-member young pioneers. They consciously correct their shortcomings and help others correct their mistakes, and help teachers reform many mischievous children. This is a common gain since the establishment of the team. Teachers say: "With the Young Pioneers, it is easier to teach students."

This year, summer vacations throughout the country also generally held recreational and sports activities such as suburban trips and youth parks. In Beijing and the Dalian-Lushun area, summer camps were also held. Young Pioneers and other classmates all had a relaxing and enjoyable summer vacation.

In addition, the Young Pioneers also did some social service work, the most common being the "Little Teacher" movement. They assisted the government in carrying out urban and rural literacy work. Members of Zhangjiakou City also led their classmates to complete the task of planting 80,000 trees and sowing 1,000 mu of barren mountains.

Rural Members Actively Participate in Auxiliary Labor

In rural areas, in addition to studying hard, members actively participated in auxiliary production labor. Members of 17 primary schools in Gusanqu District, Jingjiang County, Northern Jiangsu Province, together with teachers and classmates, worked with the masses to capture more than 152,000 locusts and podded rice stem borers in 15 days, protecting the crops in the entire district. In Dongxinzhuang Primary School, Wanquan, Chahar Province, 120 members and classmates killed a total of 1,000 jin of pests, 140 large and small harmful birds, and 346 eggs, which was well received by the villagers.

This is a brief overview of the work of the Young Pioneers in the past year. These facts show that the Young Pioneers are the best organization for uniting and educating the broad masses of young pioneers. Through the activities of the team, the results of school education can be consolidated and deepened. However, the current work of the team still lacks experience. How the activities of the team can better suit the characteristics of young pioneers and how to better combine with regular classes remain to be studied and new experiences created. Cultivating and educating the younger generation so that they become builders of the New China with rich cultural and scientific knowledge, healthy physiques, and the "Five Loves" qualities is a great and glorious task. We call on all Communist Youth League cadres working with young pioneers and team counselors to unite with school teachers and work together to accomplish this great and glorious task!

　　一年来少年儿童队工作简况
    中国少年儿童的组织已经有二十多年历史了。在大革命时代就有劳动童子团的组织；土地革命时期有少年先锋队和儿童团的组织；抗日战争时期有青年抗日先锋队与抗日儿童团的组织。这些儿童组织，在共产党和青年团的领导下，都曾经担负过一定的政治、军事及生产任务，如：站岗放哨、除奸防谍、送信、破除迷信，查禁烟赌，及进行革命宣传活动，辅助生产等。它们协助革命根据地和解放区人民，进行对敌斗争和生产斗争，获得了广大人民的赞许。
    一九四九年一月，中国共产党中央委员会，在发布建立中国新民主主义青年团的决议中，就指出团应派最好的干部去领导少年儿童工作。同年十月，青年团中央发布了建立中国少年儿童队的决议。这个全国统一的少年儿童组织，继承着过去少年儿童组织的光荣历史传统，在新中国已经建立的新形势下，负起了团结教育广大少年儿童的任务。
    少年儿童队的任务是在青年团领导下，在学习和各种集体活动中，团结和教育广大少年儿童，培养他们成为具有丰富的文化科学知识，健全体魄与五爱品德的新中国优秀儿女。
    全国已有一百五十余万队员
    一年来，少年儿童队的工作是有成绩的。现在全国已经有一百五十余万队员。少年儿童队受着广大少年儿童的热爱，并得到行政、教师、家长及人民群众的赞许。
    在学校里，少年儿童队通过参观工厂，采集标本，制作模型，以及各种集会和游戏等活动，使课本知识与实际知识相结合，以丰富与加深课堂知识的内容。譬如：参观造纸、印刷、玻璃、石灰等工厂，参观电话、电报局及火车站，使少年儿童们看到工人们如何把废纸破布变成雪白的纸张，如何印刷书刊和制造玻璃用具。学生们都说：“过去老师讲如何制造石灰，我总弄不太清楚，现在经过工人同志一讲，觉得又清楚又具体。”北京市育英中学少年儿童队组织了标本采集制作小组，在植物课老师辅导下，一共制作了二百多种动物标本，八十多种植物标本。以前上植物课大家死背书本，这样一来改变了植物课的学习方法，一考试，同学们就在园子里看着番茄、向日葵温课，这样大大提高了同学们对自然的兴趣，提高了学习成绩。过去三百人中有五十个人不及格，现在只有几个人不及格了，并且五分之一以上考九十分。天津六区中心小学队的劳作组，用铁片、木片创作自动机，和书本上自动机相对照，加深了对自动机原理的理解。他们现在正在自己创作一架内燃机。十区示范小学五年级的一个中队，有一个成绩展览室，陈列着队员们自己用铁罐、木片、纸盒制作的蒸汽机、幻灯、照相机等小模型。这些活动，启发了他们的科学兴趣并培养着他们的创造能力。另外还把难懂而有教育意义的课文编成短剧演给同学看；举行有趣的白胡子老人会，来问答各种问题；结合自然课，把夏令卫生——伤寒、痢疾、霍乱——的知识，编成短剧，用诗歌、舞蹈等方式，来宣传卫生教育；做数学、抓错别字、拼地图等游戏，来帮助记忆，启发兴趣。天津六区中心小学五年级学生刘犹棠，过去算术考零分，后来参加了少年儿童队组织的算术组，通过做算术游戏、智力测验，现在算术成绩总考七十分以上，有时甚至考一百分。经过了以上这些结合正课的活动，队员与同学们的学习成绩都有了显著的提高。
    队员带头学习成绩普遍提高
    队员的学习成绩大都是比较优秀的。如北京市师大女附中二百四十个队员中，八十分以上的有二百○五人。扬州琼花观小学上学期学习成绩最好的六十五个好学生中，有五十五个是队员。队员们不但自己学好功课，还帮助非队员学习。如：雁北广灵城完小，在未建队前，月考不及格的占全校学生百分之二十五，建队后，经过队员的带动和帮助，五月份月考成绩不及格的减少到百分之十。沈阳裕民小学四年级十三岁的队员张桂花，学习成绩总考第一，他还帮助同学继友贤、曹振玉温习功课，使他们的成绩由六十几分提高到八十几分。队员姜桂芸帮助曹振声，使他的总平均分数提高了十几分，曹振声的家长写信给学校说：“过去他回来把书包一放就玩儿去了，现在知道用功了，学习有进步了。这都是少年儿童队的好处。”
    另外，在不妨碍正课的原则下，少年儿童队进行了加强一些政治思想教育的活动，如参观历史博物馆、烈士馆、战绩展览会，参观土改后的农村生活，和苏联儿童的生活照片展览会，与战斗英雄、劳动模范见面，与解放军联欢，举行《毛泽东》、《列宁》、《我最敬爱的英雄》等故事会和座谈会。用上面这些适合儿童特点的方式，少年儿童队进行了生动活泼的爱国主义教育与国际主义教育，培养着少年儿童们的五爱品质。队员们及少年儿童们都热爱着自己的伟大领袖毛主席和世界人民的伟大革命导师斯大林大元帅。他们给毛主席写了许多信，报告自己的学习和进步。在一些集会里，他们衷心热爱地高呼着斯大林万岁！
    队员和非队员少年儿童自觉性不断提高
    在队的教育下，队员们的自觉性不断地提高着，也促使非队员少年儿童有了很大进步。他们自觉地改正缺点，并帮助别人改正错误，帮助教师改造了不少顽皮儿童。这是建队以来普遍的收获。教师们都说：“有了少年儿童队，学生好教了。”
    今年暑期各地还普遍举行了郊外旅行、青年乐园等文娱活动和体育活动。在北京市和旅大地区，还举办了夏令营。少年儿童队员们与其他同学们都过了一个轻松愉快的暑假。
    另外，少年儿童队还做了一些社会服务工作，最普遍的是小先生运动。他们协助政府开展了城市、农村的文化识字工作。张家口市的队员们还带动同学完成了植树八万株，播种荒山一千亩的任务。
    农村队员积极参加辅助劳动
    在农村，队员们除了学好功课外，还积极参加了辅助生产劳动。苏北靖江县孤山区十七所小学的队员，协同老师和同学，与群众一起，在十五天内，利用课余时间，捕捉了蝗虫、结荚稻苞虫十五万二千余只，保护了全区的庄稼。察哈尔省万全东辛庄小学，队员与同学一二○人，共打害虫一千斤，大小害鸟一百四十余只，卵三百四十六个，得到了老乡们的好评。
    这是一年来少年儿童队工作的简况。这些事实说明了少年儿童队是团结与教育广大少年儿童的最好的组织，通过队的活动，可以巩固与加深学校教育的成果。但是目前队的工作尚缺乏经验。队的活动如何更能适合少年儿童特点，如何能更好的结合正课，都有待研究和创造新的经验。培养和教育年青的一代，使他们成为具有丰富的文化科学知识，健康的体魄和五爱品德的新中国未来的建设者，是一个伟大而光荣的任务。我们号召所有青年团的少年儿童工作干部和队的辅导员，团结学校教师，共同为完成这一伟大光荣的任务而奋斗！
