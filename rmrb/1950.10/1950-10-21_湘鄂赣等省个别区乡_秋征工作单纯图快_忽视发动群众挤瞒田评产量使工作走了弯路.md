    [Reported by this newspaper] According to the Changjiang Daily news: In individual districts and townships in Linxiang and Anxiang counties in Hunan, Huangpi, Puqi, Yunmeng, and Jiayu counties in Hubei, and Lianhua and Ji'an counties in Jiangxi, some cadres, in their autumn grain collection work, harbored the idea of simply pursuing speed and fearing trouble. They neglected to mobilize the masses to squeeze out concealed land and assess output, which resulted in the work going astray.
    The ideological biases of cadres in individual districts and townships in the aforementioned counties are manifested in one way by not implementing the squeezing out of concealed land and assessing output, and not acting in accordance with the Agricultural Tax Law, but rather implementing a method of equal distribution. For example, cadres in Weidian Township, Yunmeng County, Hubei Province, forcibly distributed the public grain task of the township equally to each village. Xujia Village was assigned 6,000 jin of public grain, and the village cadres then distributed 1.2 dou of grain equally to each household. Another manifestation is setting output according to the task. For example, in Fucun Township, Fourth District, Lianhua County, Jiangxi Province, when assigning tasks to the villages, they did not conduct an investigation to clarify the actual output per mu of the land in each village and allocate it according to the actual situation. Instead, they allocated according to the assigned task. As a result, the villages also implemented a method of setting output according to the task. In villages with heavier tasks, the output of each mu of top-quality land was assessed at 480 jin; in villages with lighter tasks, the same top-quality land was assessed at 420 jin per mu. When they could not complete the task during implementation, they would increase the output further. This practice is a disguised form of equal distribution, resulting in a phenomenon of excessively light or heavy public grain burdens between villages. A third manifestation is that although they implemented squeezing out concealed land and assessing output, due to the cadres disliking trouble and not mobilizing and relying on the masses, there arose a bias towards taking everything into one's own hands and commandism. For example, when cadres in Yuyue District, Jiayu County, Hubei Province, were working in Cha'an Township, a key village for autumn grain collection, they disliked trouble and did not mobilize the masses. Only individual district cadres registered the land area and output of a few households themselves, and then subjectively determined the land grades of the entire village. Xiao Tianbao, a cadre in the Second District of Puqi County, subjectively determined the land output of each village and assigned the public grain task to each village. When the village cadres complained that it was too heavy, he ordered that it be forcibly distributed. Another district cadre, Wu Yuhua, when conducting anti-concealed land work, did not effectively mobilize the masses, but only convened meetings for the masses, ordering them to report concealed land. As a result, not even a single mu of concealed land was reported. A fourth manifestation is that although the cadres recognized the importance of squeezing out concealed land and assessing output, they did not trust the masses, resulting in taking everything into one's own hands. For example, in Changyan District, Huangpi County, Hubei Province, in the squeezing out of concealed land, the township cadres universally measured the land, which resulted in prolonged time and dissatisfaction among the masses. They also reflected, "Instead of investigating the large households (referring to landlords), they are investigating the poor people (referring to peasants)." In addition, it is also manifested in neglecting to mobilize the masses to oppose the conspiracies of unlawful landlords to sabotage the autumn grain collection. For example, in the leadership of the autumn grain collection in Cha'an Township, Yuyue District, Jiayu County, the district cadres turned a blind eye to the destructive activities of unlawful landlords and did not bother to ask.
    When Linxiang County, Hunan Province, investigated concealed land, it only paid attention to mobilizing cadres to take the lead and mobilizing the masses to report on their own, but neglected the main aspect, namely, mobilizing the masses to squeeze out the black land of landlords. As a result, the peasants reported concealed land, but the landlords' large amount of concealed land was not squeezed out. The leadership in the aforementioned areas should pay timely attention to correcting these deviations.

    湘鄂赣等省个别区乡
    秋征工作单纯图快
    忽视发动群众挤瞒田评产量使工作走了弯路
    【本报讯】据长江日报消息：湖南临湘、安乡，湖北黄陂、蒲圻、云梦、嘉鱼，江西莲花、吉安等县个别区乡在秋征工作中，由于干部存有单纯图快和怕麻烦的思想。忽视了发动群众挤瞒田、评产量，结果使工作绕了弯路。
    上述各县个别区乡干部的思想偏向，一种是表现在不实行挤瞒田、评产量，不按农业税法办事，而是实行平均摊派的办法。如湖北云梦县魏店乡干部，硬把该乡的公粮任务平均摊派到各村、徐家村摊到六千斤公粮，村干部又每户平均摊派一斗二升谷。另一种是按任务定产量，如江西莲花县四区凫村乡，在向村分配任务时，并未经过调查，弄清各村田亩产量，按实际情况分配，而是按照任务分配数量，结果，各村也就实行了按任务定产量的办法。有的村任务重了，每亩上等田评成四百八十斤产量；有的村任务轻，同样的上等田，却评成每亩产量四百二十斤。在执行中不能完成任务时，就再提高产量。这种作法是一种变象的平均摊派的方式，结果形成村与村间公粮负担畸轻畸重的现象。第三种表现是虽然实行挤瞒田、评产量，但由于干部嫌麻烦，不发动依靠群众，因而产生包办代替、命令主义的偏向。如湖北嘉鱼县鱼岳区干部在秋征重点村茶庵乡工作时，嫌麻烦，不发动群众，只由个别区干部自己挨门登记几家的田亩、产量，就主观地定出全村的地亩等级。蒲圻县二区干部萧天保，主观地定了各村的地亩产量，分配了各村的公粮任务，村干部喊重了，他就命令要强分；另一区干部吴玉华，在进行反瞒田时，不很好的发动群众，只召集群众开会，命令群众报出瞒田，结果瞒田仍然一亩也报不出。第四种表现是干部虽然认识到挤瞒田、评产量的重要性，但不相信群众，形成包办代替。如湖北黄陂县长堰区在挤瞒田中，是由乡干部普遍丈田，结果拖长了时间，群众也不满意。并反映说：“不查大户（指地主）查穷人（指农民）”。此外，还表现在忽视发动群众反对不法地主破坏秋征的阴谋活动，如嘉鱼县鱼岳区区干部在茶庵乡领导秋征中，对于不法地主的破坏活动，听之任之，不闻不问。
    湖南临湘县查瞒田时，只注意动员干部带头和发动群众自报，但忽视了主要的一面，即发动群众挤地主的黑地，结果农民报出瞒田，而地主的大量瞒田，却未挤出。上述这些偏差，该地领导上应及时注意纠正。
