Xinhua News Agency Compilation of TASS Reports:

　　The First (Political and Security) Committee of the United Nations General Assembly began its work on September 30. In order to resolve the Korean question, the delegations of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia jointly submitted a proposal on the question of Korean independence at the afternoon meeting on October 2. The full text of the proposal is as follows: "Recognizing that the legitimate desire of the Korean people to establish a unified, independent, and democratic Korea has not been realized; recognizing that the primary task of the United Nations Organization is to peacefully resolve disputes that may disrupt overall peace in accordance with the principles of international law and justice; and hoping to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean question and restore peace and security in the Far East, the United Nations General Assembly recommends:

    “First, the warring parties in Korea immediately cease hostilities.

    “Second, the government of the United States and the governments of other countries immediately withdraw their troops from Korea in order to guarantee the Korean people the opportunity to exercise their sacred and inviolable sovereignty and freely determine their own domestic affairs.

    “Third, after the withdrawal of foreign troops, general elections for the Korean National Assembly should be held as soon as possible. These elections must allow the entire Korean people to freely express their will in order to establish a unified, independent national government of Korea.

    “Fourth, members of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and members of the National Assembly of South Korea shall hold a joint meeting to elect an equal number of representatives to form a committee to organize and preside over the free elections of the entire Korean people. The joint meeting shall elect an all-Korean provisional committee to perform the functions of administering the country before the All-Korean National Assembly is elected and the All-Korean permanent government is established.

    “Fifth, a United Nations committee must be established with the participation of representatives from countries bordering Korea to monitor the free elections of the All-Korean National Assembly.

    “Sixth, the Economic and Social Council, with the participation of representatives from Korea, shall promptly formulate and adopt a plan to provide assistance to Korea through the United Nations Organization and necessary economic and technical assistance in order to restore the national economy devastated by the war.

    “Seventh, after the establishment of the All-Korean government, the Security Council shall review the issue of admitting Korea to the United Nations Organization.”

    At the same time, in addition to the joint proposal, the Soviet delegation also put forward the following two proposals, demanding "the dissolution of the United Nations Commission on Korea" and demanding that "the United States armed forces cease the barbaric bombing of peaceful residents in Korean cities and residential areas."

    Before the Soviet Union and the other four countries including Ukraine submitted the above three proposals, Australia, Brazil, Cuba, the Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom had already submitted a proposal on September 30, actually dictated by the United States, for so-called resolution of the Korean question. This proposal advocates the establishment of a committee to take over the work of the current illegal so-called "Korean Commission" to establish a so-called "independent, unified, and democratic" national government of Korea. In order to ensure the emergence of this government and to guarantee the "stable situation" throughout Korea, the so-called "United Nations forces" must remain in Korea. Before this committee arrives in Korea, the countries participating in the committee should form a temporary committee to consult with and provide advice to the "United Nations Unified Command."

    The struggle in the UN General Assembly's Political Committee over the Korean question is now revolving around the above two proposals. At the meeting on September 30, starting with US Representative Austin, representatives from Pakistan, Peru, Chile, Cuba, Greece, Venezuela, Syria, France, and Iraq successively spoke in support of the eight-nation proposal. At the meeting on October 2, Vyshinsky first spoke, sternly refuting the eight-nation proposal. Subsequently, Polish Representative Wilbrowsky, Belarusian Representative Kiselev, and Czechoslovak Representative Siroky spoke successively, unanimously opposing the eight-nation proposal.

　　苏、乌、白、波、捷五国代表团
    在联大政委会提出提案主张和平解决朝鲜问题
    【本报讯】据新华社综合塔斯社讯：联合国大会第一（政治及安全）委员会已于九月三十日开始工作。为了解决朝鲜问题，苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克五国代表团已在十月二日下午会议上联合提出了关于朝鲜独立问题的提案。提案全文如下：“鉴于朝鲜人民建立统一、独立、民主的朝鲜的合法愿望未能实现；鉴于联合国组织的主要任务在于依照国际法与公正的原则和平解决可能破坏全面和平的争端；并希望使朝鲜问题获得和平解决以及恢复远东的和平与安全起见，联合国大会建议：
    “第一，在朝鲜交战的双方立即停战。
    “第二，美国政府及其他各国政府立即撤退其在朝鲜的军队，以便保证朝鲜人民有机会行使其神圣不可侵犯的主权，自由决定其自己的国内事务。
    “第三，在外国军队撤退后，尽早举行朝鲜国民议会的普选，此项选举须使全朝鲜人民自由表示其意志，以建立统一、独立的朝鲜国家政府。
    “第四，由朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议和南朝鲜国民议会的议员举行联席会议，选出人数相等的代表，组成委员会，以组织和主持全体朝鲜人民的自由选举事宜。由联席会议选出全朝鲜临时委员会，在全朝鲜国民议会尚未选出和全朝鲜永久政府尚未成立之前执行管理国家的职务。
    “第五，成立必须有与朝鲜接壤的各国代表参加的联合国委员会，以监视全朝鲜国民议会的自由选举事宜。
    “第六，经社理事会在朝鲜代表的参加下，迅速拟订通过联合国组织和必要的经济与技术援助给朝鲜以帮助的计划，以便恢复遭到战争破坏的国民经济。
    “第七，在全朝鲜政府成立以后，安理会审查准许朝鲜加入联合国组织的问题”。
    同时，苏联代表团还在联合提案之外提出如下两项提案，要求“解散联合国朝鲜委员会”与要求“美国武装部队停止对朝鲜城市及住宅区的和平居民的野蛮轰炸”。
    在苏联与乌克兰等四国提出上述三项提案以前，澳大利亚、巴西、古巴、荷兰、挪威、巴基斯坦、菲律宾和英国八国，早在九月三十日提出了实际上是美国授意的所谓解决朝鲜问题的提案。该提案主张成立一个委员会，接替目前非法的所谓“朝鲜委员会”的工作，来建立所谓“独立、统一与民主”的朝鲜全国政府。为保证这个政府的产生与保证整个朝鲜的“稳定情况”，所谓“联合国军队”得留驻朝鲜。在这一委员会到达朝鲜前，参加该委员会的各国应组成临时委员会，与“联合国统一司令部”商议，并向司令部提供意见。
    联大政治委员会关于朝鲜问题上的斗争，现在正环绕着上述两个提案在进行。在九月三十日会议上，以美国代表奥斯汀开始，巴基斯坦、秘鲁、智利、古巴、希腊、委内瑞拉、叙利亚、法国、伊拉克的代表相继发言支持八国提案。在十月二日会议上，维辛斯基首先发言严正驳斥八国提案。接着，波兰代表威尔勃洛夫斯基、白俄罗斯代表基塞列夫、捷克斯洛伐克代表西罗基相继发言，一致反对八国提案。（两日会议详情见第四版）
