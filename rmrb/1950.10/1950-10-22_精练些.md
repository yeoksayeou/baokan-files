Be More Concise
    Wang Chaowen

    A friend said this: those novels, dramas, long poems, and comic strips that are lengthy, disorganized, mediocre, and even empty are simply a torment and a punishment for readers and audiences. Instead of enhancing their appreciation and thus educating them, it wastes their time, exhausts their energy, and makes them afraid and disgusted with such works. If these works have any benefit for readers and audiences, it is only to test and train their patience.

    This criticism is sarcastic, but it is not without basis. If authors can calmly and critically view this sarcastic criticism, it will be beneficial to improve our creative style of making short things long and being grandiose and impractical.

    In fact, this style is not only manifested in literary and artistic works, nor is it only being criticized today. The propositions of literary predecessors such as Lu Xun, Gorky, and Ehrenburg, and Chairman Mao's document "Oppose Party Stereotypes," are not too unfamiliar to the vast majority of literary and artistic workers. Chairman Mao's extremely severe criticism of "A, B, C, D, opening a Chinese medicine shop," and lengthy articles and reports that are boundless and boastful, has already had a great impact on many literary and artistic workers. However, we still lack a broader active response, and we have not yet been able to universally practice this brilliant instruction in our creations.

    Why haven't we universally felt the seriousness of the above-mentioned tendency? If someone believes that it is mainly due to a lack of a clear mass perspective, I don't think it's an exaggeration. If the author can truly consider their style from the social role of the work, starting from the effect, starting from the interests of the masses, and seriously consider the needs of the masses, they would never forgive themselves for this style.

    Of course, there are many reasons for the complexity of the content of works: some are limited by time and cannot be refined. Some are limited by their ability to critique and organize, and they cannot grasp the laws of art, nor can they discover and grasp the core of the problem among the ever-changing things, and concentrate the problem. That is, they cannot distinguish what is important, what is secondary, and what is unnecessary, and give appropriate selection and arrangement. Some do not fully understand the needs of the masses, what problems must be solved in specific situations, but think that bringing out all the materials is richness, completeness, and completion of the creative task. But if there is a very clear mass perspective, and treat one's own works very seriously, solemnly, and even harshly, the state of being lengthy, disorganized, empty, and mediocre will be eliminated more quickly, and works that are clear, simple, deep, and have fresh insights will gradually increase. The quality of writing style is inseparable from the author's way of thinking and ideology.

    Whether it is a novel, a play, a long poem, or a comic strip, it must be able to expose contradictions and clearly indicate or imply how contradictions should and can be resolved. Whether it is art or essays and reports, it must propose and solve urgent problems that the masses need to propose and solve. Regardless of the differences in the way art and essays and reports expose and solve problems, they must help readers and audiences understand reality more easily than contacting reality itself when they come into contact with the work. Otherwise, the masses have no need to appreciate this kind of work, and we have no reason to force them to appreciate this art. If the masses have to pay too much time and energy without getting a considerable return, even if this work has vivid images, amusing gimmicks, extraordinary aphorisms, and beautiful rhetoric, readers and audiences will not be very grateful, because the artist has not given them the help they deserve.

    Of course, long and complex is not good, and short and empty is not good either. Of course, not being long when it should be is also formalism. But at present, the most important thing is to change that tendency: -- all-encompassing, treating dispensable details as treasures that the masses like, one-sidedly pursuing richness and completeness, thinking that more and bigger is "improvement," or thinking that not being verbose cannot be popular, and the description of anything must start from the pre-Qin emperors without asking if there is any need. In order to be responsible to the masses, for the political effect of the work, we should re-read Chairman Mao's rectification documents in connection with our own creation, learn from the spirit of Lenin writing leaflets, learn from the reports of Stalin and Dimitrov, learn from the propositions and works of Lu Xun and other literary artists supported by the people, and stop and abandon the style that does not fully meet the needs of the masses and the interests of the revolution.

　　精练些
    王朝闻
    一个朋友这样说：那些又冗长又零乱又平凡甚至空虚的小说、戏剧、以及长诗、连环画，简直是给予读者和观众的一种磨难，一种刑罚。与其说是为了增强对方的欣赏兴趣，从而教育他们，不如说是不惜浪费他们的时间，疲劳他们的精力，叫他们害怕和厌弃这种作品。这种作品如果对读者和观众还有点好处的话，那只是借此考验和锻炼他们的耐性。
    这种指责是挖苦的，但确实不是无的放矢。对于这种挖苦的指责，如果作者能够冷静地批判地看待时，对于我们那些把短的拉长和大而无当的创作作风的改进是有益处的。
    其实，这种作风不只表现在文艺作品上，也不是今天才受到指责。鲁迅、高尔基、爱伦堡等等文艺前辈的主张，毛主席《反对党八股》的文件，对于绝大多数的文艺工作者说来，不是太生疏的。毛主席对于“甲乙丙丁，开中药铺”、漫无边际、夸夸其谈的长文章和大报告的极其严厉的批评，在很多文艺工作者中已经产生了很大作用。但我们还缺乏更广泛的行动的响应，还没有能够在创作上普遍地实践这一英明指示。
    为什么我们没有普遍地感到上述那种倾向的严重呢？如果有人认为主要是由于缺乏明确的群众观点，我看不能算是乱戴大帽子。如果作者真能从作品的社会作用来考虑其作风，从效果出发，从群众利益出发，认真考虑群众需要，决不至于原谅自己这种作风。
    当然，作品内容芜杂的原因很多：有的是限于时间，来不及精练。有的是限于批判与组织的能力，掌握不住艺术的法则，不能在千变万化的事物中间发现和抓住问题的中心，把问题集中起来。即是不能辨别什么是重要的，什么是次要的，什么是不必要的，而给予适当的取舍和安排。有的是不十分理解群众的需要，在具体情况下必须解决什么问题，却以为把所有的材料通通搬出来就是丰富、是完整，就是完成了创作任务。但这些，如果真有十分明确的群众观点，十分认真、严肃、甚至苛刻地来对待自己的作品，冗长、零乱、空虚、平凡的状态将会更快地消灭，明确、单纯、有深度、有新鲜见地的作品定会逐步增多。文风的好坏和作者的思想方法思想意识是分不开的。
    不论是小说，是戏，是长诗，是连环图画，必须能够揭发矛盾，明示或暗示矛盾应该和可以如何解决。不论艺术或是论文和报告，必须为群众提出和解决迫切需要提出和解决的问题。不论艺术和论文、报告，在揭发问题解决问题的方式上有什么不同，总必须是帮助读者和观众在接触作品时比接触现实本身更便于理解现实。不然群众没有欣赏这种作品的必要，我们更没有理由强迫他们欣赏这种艺术。如果要群众付出太多时间和精力的代价而得不到相当的收获，尽管这一作品中具备着生动的形象，逗人发笑的噱头，不平凡的警句，漂亮的辞藻，读者和观众也不会十分感激，因为艺术家没有给予他们应有的帮助。
    当然，长而杂不好，短而空也不好。当然，该长不长，也是形式主义。但目前，最要紧的是改变那种倾向：——包罗万象，把可有可无的枝节当成群众喜欢的宝贝，片面追求丰富和完整，以为多和大就是“提高”，或者以为不噜厩就不能普及，任何事物的描写也要从前三皇后五帝谈起而不问有什么必要。为了对群众负责，为了作品的政治效果，我们应该联系自己的创作重新精读毛主席整风文件，向列宁写传单的精神学习，向斯大林、季米特洛夫的报告学习，向鲁迅以及为人民所拥护的其他文艺家们的主张和作品学习，停止和抛弃那种不十分符合群众需要和革命利益的作风。
