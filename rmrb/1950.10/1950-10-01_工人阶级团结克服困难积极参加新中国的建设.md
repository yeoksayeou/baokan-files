　　Workers Unite to Overcome Difficulties and Actively Participate in the Construction of New China
    All-China Federation of Trade Unions Directly Selects Industrial Labor Model Representative Zhao Zhankui
    Today is the first National Day celebration since the founding of the People's Republic of China. A year ago today, the war was still going on on the mainland, and our motherland declared its establishment amidst the sound of artillery fire. Since then, the reactionary rule has been overthrown, and the Chinese people have become the masters of the country. This is a great victory and the result of the heroic struggle of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, in this short year, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, great achievements have been made in all aspects of work across the country. Not only have we basically liberated the mainland and established people's governments at all levels; but also restored and developed production, stabilized prices, and put the difficult national economy on the road to improvement. In particular, the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty and the great assistance from the Soviet Union have opened up a bright future for the construction of New China. We must work hard to achieve this goal.
    It must be recognized that the construction of New China has difficulties. This requires all of us to work together to overcome them. The Chinese people, especially the Chinese working class, not only have the determination to overcome difficulties, but also have accumulated experience. For example, when we were in northern Shaanxi a few years ago, although the production there was backward, transportation was inconvenient, and it was also subject to enemy blockade, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we also built small-scale machine industries, opened many factories, and produced a large number of munitions and industrial products to supply the front lines and the people of northern Shaanxi. Today's conditions are much better than then, what difficulties can stop us?
    Therefore, on the occasion of celebrating the first National Day, the Chinese working class should take action first, carry forward our glorious tradition, participate actively in the construction of New China with the attitude of being the masters of the country and with high labor enthusiasm. According to the specific conditions of various factories and mines, launch production competitions and create new record movements, improve production, and accelerate the victory of the construction of New China.
    We must also overcome complacency, be vigilant against enemy sabotage, unite the people of the whole country, unite all the peace forces of the world, and stop the aggression of the imperialists.

　　工人阶级团结克服困难  积极参加新中国的建设
    全总直接评选工业劳模代表  赵占魁
    今天是中华人民共和国诞生后的第一个国庆纪念节日。一年前的今天，战争还在大陆进行，我们的祖国就在这炮火声中宣告了他的成立。从此推翻了反动统治，中国人民当了国家的主人。这是个伟大的胜利，是中国人民在毛主席领导下英勇斗争的结果。
    自中华人民共和国成立以来，在这短短的一年中，全国人民在毛主席、中央人民政府领导下，各方面的工作都获得了很大成绩。我们不但基本上解放了大陆，建立了各级人民政权；而且恢复、发展了生产，稳定了物价，使艰困的国家经济走上好转。特别是中苏条约的订立，苏联老大哥对我们大力的帮助，这给新中国的建设展开了光明的远景。我们要为达到这个目的而努力。
    必须认清，新中国的建设是有困难的。这就要我们大家齐心努力去克服。中国人民，特别是中国工人阶级，不但有克服困难的决心，而且也积累了经验。如前几年我们在陕北时，虽然那里生产落后，交通不便，而且又受着敌人的封锁，但是在毛主席领导下，我们也建设了小型的机器工业，开了很多工厂，生产了大批军火和工业品，供给了前线及陕北的人民。今天的条件比那时好得多，还有什么困难能阻挡我们呢？
    因此，在庆祝第一个国庆日的今天，中国工人阶级应首先行动起来，发扬我们过去的光荣传统，以国家主人翁的态度，以高度的劳动热情，积极参加新中国的建设。根据各厂矿具体情况，展开生产竞赛和创造新纪录运动，提高生产，加速新中国建设的胜利。
    我们更要克服麻痹思想，警惕敌人的破坏，团结全国人民，团结全世界的和平力量，制止帝国主义者的侵略。
