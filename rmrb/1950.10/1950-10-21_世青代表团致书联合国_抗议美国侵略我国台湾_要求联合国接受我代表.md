Xinhua News Agency, October 20th:

    The World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation, prior to their departure from China, sent a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie, protesting the United States' aggression against Chinese territory Taiwan and demanding that China's representative be allowed to participate in the United Nations organization. The original letter is as follows:

    Secretary-General,

    The World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation, comprising forty-two youth representatives from thirty-two countries, has completed a forty-day visit to the People's Republic of China.

    At a time when American imperialism is preparing for a new world war, repeatedly infringing upon Chinese territory and intensifying its provocations against China, we want to bring to the attention of the United Nations General Assembly some facts that we have seen during our stay in China, facts that contribute to the cause of peace and the future of youth worldwide.

    In the past six weeks, we have visited many cities, villages, factories, primary and secondary schools, and universities. We have come into contact with countless young workers, farmers, soldiers, and students. Everywhere we have seen the younger generation working enthusiastically for the new China, rejoicing in their liberation from the oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang.

    We have personally witnessed that under the leadership of the Central People's Government and its leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, China has achieved national unity for the first time in its history. This government is defending the true interests of the Chinese people.

    Under these circumstances, our delegation finds it difficult to understand the hostile attitude of certain member states of the United Nations that refuse to recognize the Chinese People's Government and oppose China sending representatives to the United Nations.

    While seventeen countries have already established diplomatic relations with the Chinese People's Government, governments of countries such as the Soviet Union, India, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and others in the United Nations have supported the proposal to expel the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek government and accept the representatives of the People's Government who truly represent the Chinese people.

    The World Federation of Democratic Youth firmly supports this proposal because we believe that the representative of a great nation with 475 million people can no longer be ignored.

    During our stay, we also witnessed the righteous indignation throughout China against American imperialism's aggression in Korea, occupation of Taiwan, and the violation of Chinese territory by American aircraft, which killed and injured many people. American imperialism's aggression in Korea is gradually extending the war to China's doorstep.

    Chinese youth are peace-loving, but they have all expressed their unanimous determination to repel any imperialist aggression against their country.

    We believe that the United Nations General Assembly should take the following measures as soon as possible, in accordance with the United Nations Charter, to benefit the cause of peace:

    (1) Expel the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek, who no longer have any connection with the Chinese people, and have the representatives of the People's Republic of China participate in the United Nations organization.

    (2) American troops should withdraw from Taiwan, and the American Navy should respect China's territorial waters.

    In the name of seventy million youth, we demand the implementation of these measures. Secretary-General, please accept our highest regards.

    世青代表团致书联合国
    抗议美国侵略我国台湾  要求联合国接受我代表
    【新华社二十日讯】世界民主青年联盟代表团在离华前夕，致书联合国大会秘书长赖伊，抗议美国侵略中国领土台湾，要求允许中国代表参加联合国组织。该信原文如下：秘书长先生：
    包括四十二位青年代表三十二个国家的世界民主青年联盟代表团，已经完成了在中华人民共和国四十天的访问。
    值此美帝国主义为了准备新的世界战争，多次侵犯中国领土，加紧对中国挑衅的时候，我们要提起联合国大会注意到我们在逗留中国期间所看到的一些事实，这些事实对于和平事业及全世界青年的未来是有贡献的。
    在过去六个星期中，我们访问了许多城市、乡村、工厂、中小学校和大学，我们曾经接触了无数的青年工人、农民、兵士和学生。到处我们都看到年青的一代为着新中国而热情地工作，为着他们从帝国主义和国民党的压迫下获得解放而欢欣鼓舞。
    我们曾亲眼见到在中央人民政府和其领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，中国有史以来第一次实现了国家的统一，这个政府是保卫中国人民的真正利益的。
    在这些情况下，我们代表团对于联合国的某些会员国拒绝承认中国人民政府并反对中国派遣代表到联合国的这种敌对态度，确实难以了解。
    与中国人民政府建立外交关系的已经有十七个国家正同时，在联合国中苏联、印度、波兰、捷克等国的政府以及其他国家已经支持开除蒋介石政府代表并接受真。代表中国人民的人民政府代表的建议。
    世界民主青年坚决地支持这个建议，因为我们认为一个具有四亿七千五百万人口的伟大国家的代表再不能继续被忽视了。
    在我们逗留的期间，我们同样地见到全中国对美帝国主义的侵略朝鲜占领台湾，以及美国飞机侵犯中国领土，杀伤许多人民所激起的义愤。美国帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略正逐渐地将战争扩展到中国的门前。
    中国青年是酷爱和平的，但是他们都一致坚决地表示了要击退帝国主义对他们国家的任何侵略的决心。
    我们认为联合国大会应根据联合国宪章尽快采取下列的措施，以利和平事业：
    （一）开除和中国人民已无关系的蒋介石的代表，并由中华人民共和国的代表参加联合国组织。
    （二）美国军队撤离台湾，美国海军应尊重中国的领海。
    我们以七千万青年的名义，要求执行这些措施。秘书长先生，请接受我们崇高的敬礼。
    现在中国的世界民主青年联盟代表团团长
        世界民主青年联盟总书记布加拉（签字）
          一九五○年十月二十日北京
