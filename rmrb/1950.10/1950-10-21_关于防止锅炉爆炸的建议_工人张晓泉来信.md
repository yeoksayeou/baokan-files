    Suggestions on Preventing Boiler Explosions
    Letter from Worker Zhang Xiaoquan

    To the Editor:

    I am a worker who operates a boiler at the Jinghua Rubber Factory. After reading the news in the September 20th newspaper about the boiler explosion at the Jusheng Flour Company in Yuxian County, which resulted in over forty casualties, I have some opinions. The occurrence of this incident is mostly due to the company's administration and technicians not paying attention to safety work, neglecting technical regulations, and being negligent.

    As I understand it, the installation of prime movers in the Northeast region must be submitted to the government for permission, and relevant authorities must conduct regular inspections every year. Boiler operators must be issued a license by the government before being allowed to work (after a boiler is manufactured, it must be inspected and approved by the government security authorities before it can be released from the factory for use). Some factories in the North China region do not adhere to specifications when installing prime movers and only seek to save money and trouble, thus accidents occur constantly. The government has not explicitly promulgated a system for regular inspections of prime movers. There is also no assessment system for boiler operators. Security authorities have also not inspected whether boilers are qualified and suitable for use.

    I suggest that all factories across the country must pay attention to the following matters:

    (1) Relevant government departments should establish mechanical safety inspection teams to implement a regular inspection system to actively prevent dangerous accidents from occurring.

    (2) Establish training classes for boiler workers, and select boiler workers with high technical skills to serve as lecturers to improve everyone's boiler operating skills.

    关于防止锅炉爆炸的建议
    工人张晓泉来信编辑同志：
    我是京华橡胶厂烧锅炉的工人。我看了九月二十日报纸上发表的禹县聚生面粉公司发生锅炉爆炸死伤四十余人的消息以后，有一点意见，这个事件的发生，多半由于该公司行政及技师不重视保安工作，忽略技术规则与麻痹大意所致。
    据我了解，原动机的设置在东北地区必须呈请政府许可才能装置，有关机关每年必须施行定期检查。汽缶士（烧锅炉的工人）必须由政府发给许可证方准其工作（锅炉制造之后，必须经过政府保安机关检查合格方准出厂使用）。华北地区的某些工厂对原动机设置，不讲规格，光图省钱省事，因此不断地发生事故。对于原动机的按期检查制度，政府就没有明令颁布过。烧锅炉的工人亦无考核制度。对锅炉是否合格适用，保安机关也没有加以检查。
    我建议全国各厂，必须注意以下几件事情：
    （一）政府有关部门应设置机械安全检查组，实行定期检查制度，从积极方面防止危险事故的发生。
    （二）成立司炉工人学习训练班，选聘司炉技术高的工人当讲师，以提高大家的司炉技术。
          京华橡胶厂工人  张晓泉
