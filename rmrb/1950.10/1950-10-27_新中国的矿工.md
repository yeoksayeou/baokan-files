　　Miners of New China

    Under the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, workers were the most despised. Especially coal miners, who had the lowest social status, the least compensation, and lived the most painful and miserable lives. But today, the Chinese people have been liberated, the working class has become the masters of the country, and coal miners have turned themselves over!
    Now, most of the leading cadres in coal mines, such as mine directors, factory directors, section chiefs, and pit supervisors, are selected from among the employees; the grassroots leaders among the workers—group leaders—are also elected by themselves. At the same time, the workers have recognized that they are managing their own mines, shouldering the important task of national industrialization, and have brought into play the spirit of masters of their own affairs, overfulfilling the production plan for the third quarter of this year.
    In the past, coal miners had no opportunity to receive education. But today, the situation is different. The Central People's Government plans to add an educational fund to the national investment in 1951, planning to eliminate illiteracy in the mines within two or three years. The Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry has already set up a large-scale coal mine workers' school in Qinhuangdao to improve the workers' cultural level. The school has two departments, academic affairs and general affairs, and currently has more than 100 faculty and staff members. The workers who enter the school retain their original positions and salaries, and adopt a rotational training system, with six months as one term. According to the workers' original cultural level, three classes are set up: elementary, intermediate, and advanced. After graduating from the elementary class, they can recognize at least 500 characters; the intermediate class will raise the original elementary school level to the level of the first or second grade of junior high school; the advanced class can raise the original junior high school level to the level of the first grade of senior high school.
    The treatment of coal miners has been appropriately improved. They are paid for a full month of work based on 25 working days per month, with an average monthly salary equivalent to about 400 to 500 catties of millet. This can maintain the minimum living expenses of a family of five. The mines also provide free family dormitories. If a worker gets sick, the mine hospital provides free treatment, except for food expenses, which are borne by the worker himself. For workers who need long-term recuperation, the Coal Mine Management Bureau has established sanatoriums in the scenic area of Qinhuangdao.
    Workers' children can enter the children's schools established by the mines for free. After graduation, they can be sent to vocational middle schools for workers' children, where all expenses for food, lodging, books, and stationery are paid for by the public. After graduating from middle school, they can also be recommended to the China University of Mining and Technology for further study. In short, coal mine workers today will no longer have to worry about their own lives or the education of their children as they did in the past.
    The coal miners of New China are creating a better future for themselves!

　　新中国的矿工
    吴  澧
    在帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动统治下，工人是最被人看不起的。尤其是煤矿工人，社会地位最低，待遇最少，过着最痛苦的悲惨生活。可是今天，中国人民已获得了解放，工人阶级已当了国家的主人，煤矿工人大翻身！
    现在，煤矿上大多数的领导干部，如矿长、厂长、科长及井口主任等，都是由职工中选拔充任；工人中的基层领导人——小组长，也都是他们自己选举的。同时，工人都已认清了自己是在管理自己的矿山，担负着国家工业化的重要任务，发挥了主人翁的工作精神，超额地完成了本年第三季度的生产计划。
    煤矿工人过去是没有受教育的机会的。但今天的情况不同了，中央人民政府拟在一九五一年国家投资内，增加一笔教育费，计划在二三年内消灭矿山文盲。中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局，现已在秦皇岛筹设了一所大规模的煤矿工人学校，以提高工人的文化水平。该校设有教务、总务两处，现有教职员百余人。入学的工人都是原职原薪，采取轮训制，六个月为一期。根据工人的原有文化程度，分设初、中、高级三个班。初级班毕业后，最少能识五百个字；中级班则使原有小学程度提高到初中一二年级的程度；高级班可使原有初中程度提高到高中一年级的程度。
    煤矿工人的待遇，目前已作了适当的改善。他们一月以工作二十五天为满工，平均一月的工资约合小米四、五百斤。这样就能维持一家五口人的最低生活了。各矿山并免费供给家属宿舍。工人如果生了病，除伙食费由工人自己负担外，矿山医院免费给予治疗。对需要长期疗养的工人，煤矿管理总局已在秦皇岛风景优美的地区设立了疗养院。
    工人的子女，可以免费进入矿山设立的子弟学校。毕业后，可被送入职工子弟职业中学，食、宿、书籍及文具等，全部都是公费。中学毕业后，还可以被保送入中国矿业学院深造。总之，煤矿职工在今天再也不会像过去那样既要耽心自己的生活，又要操心子女的教育问题了。
    新中国的煤矿工人，正在创造着自己更美好的将来！
