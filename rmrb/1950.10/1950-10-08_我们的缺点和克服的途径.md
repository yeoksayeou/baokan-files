　　Our Shortcomings and Ways to Overcome Them
　　Minister of Soviet Film Affairs, Bolshakov

　　The historical resolutions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), especially the resolution on the film "Bright Life," have opened up new creative horizons and new paths of development for Soviet film artists.

　　Almost four years have passed since the publication of these resolutions, and we now see the enormous and fruitful impact these decisions have had on the entire life of Soviet cinema.

　　Soviet film art has advanced along the path indicated by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and it has achieved new successes. The skills of screenwriters, directors, actors, cinematographers, artists, and composers have been growing and improving year by year. Our films have become more profound in ideological content and more complete in artistic form. Color films have become widespread—more than half of all films released are now in color. However, our films still have many unresolved problems and significant shortcomings that hinder our progress.

　　One of the most significant shortcomings in our work is the continued production of low-quality films. Soviet audiences legitimately and rightly demand that all released films be of high quality. However, some directors have created films that are ideologically and artistically mediocre and clumsy, such as "Ali-Tete Goes to the Mountains" (directed by Donskoy).

　　In its resolution on "Bright Life," the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) pointed out that "Soviet audiences have grown, their cultural needs and demands have expanded, and the Party and the government will continue to cultivate excellent aesthetic sense and high demands for works of art among the people."

　　This means that the task of Soviet film workers is to specialize in the production of high-quality films. To achieve this goal, it is necessary not only to improve the sense of responsibility of the entire creative team involved in making films—especially the producer-directors—but also to strengthen supervision during the creation of each film. The experience of recent years has proven that the more refined and well-organized the management, the better the guarantee that films will avoid failure and defects. The creation process of the film "Alexander Popov" is a lesson in this regard. The production of this film was initially entrusted to directors L. Trauberg and S. Timoshenko. During the review of the initial scenes they filmed, the artistic committee and leaders of the film department discovered that the directors could not guarantee the creation of a patriotic film about the great inventor of radio. After the unsuccessful directors were replaced by new producers, Rappoport and Eisymont, the film, as is well known, became a highly artistic and deeply patriotic film.

　　The system of producer supervision and monitoring should be improved in every way. This supervision is not only necessary for young directors, but also for experienced and meritorious masters (who are also not immune to errors and failures). In particular, the appearance of the clumsy film "Ali-Tete Goes to the Mountains" can be partially explained by insufficient supervision of the director's work. The studio and the film department believed that Donskoy was an experienced large-scale producer whose films were of a high standard, so there was little supervision of his work. This example once again convinces us that even rich specialized experience does not prevent creative failures and errors.

　　Careful supervision of film shooting should first be organized in the studio. To this end, the studio's artistic committee must work actively, systematically reviewing the filmed material and submitting the conclusions of the review to the studio负责人。

　　It is self-evident that this supervision does not absolve the director and the entire production team of the responsibilities entrusted to them. Moreover, this supervision should be organized in such a way that it becomes one of the forms of constant creative assistance to the production team.

　　There are still some major shortcomings in screenwriting. It is true that several original and highly ideological screenplays have recently been created, such as: Pavlenko and Chiureli's "The Fall of Berlin," Pogodin's "Kuban Cossacks," Babayev's "Pavlov," Rozhkov and Pomeshchikov's "Siberian Symphony," M. Smirnova's "Village Teacher," etc.

　　Unfortunately, such screenplays are very few. And we are particularly lacking in screenplays about the heroic labor achievements of the Soviet working class, about innovators in production, and about eliminating the boundaries between mental and physical labor. Directors working on comedies also feel a serious lack of good screenplays.

　　Current Soviet cinema has achieved some successes in creating high-quality films; it has actively enhanced the sense of responsibility of film leaders and creators. Therefore, it now has all the conditions to expand the number of film releases without reducing quality. However, in order to expand the number of film releases, it needs not only skilled and experienced directors and actors, but also, and most importantly, very valuable and high-quality film screenplays.

　　The work on film screenplays is very bad in the various affiliated republics. Several republic film ministers hold incorrect and dependent attitudes towards solving this most important problem. They like to think that the screenplays for national film studios should be supplied by the Moscow Script Institute, so they do not care at all about educating national screenwriting personnel or promoting national film screenplay work.

　　This is the reason why the screenplays for the Tashkent, Yerevan, Minsk, and Baku film studios have always been supplied by Moscow writers. This situation cannot be considered normal. In all these republics, there is a large contingent of talented national literary writers and creators. The task of the republics is to guide the strength of local writers to work for the film industry and to give them the necessary creative assistance.

　　Providing various methods of assistance to develop national film screenplay work in the various affiliated republics—this is the basic and main task of the Screenplay Institute of the Soviet Film Department. There are already many examples of fruitful cooperation between national writers and Russian writers in creating highly ideological screenplays. For example, Kazakh writer Tazhibayev collaborated with Pogodin to write an excellent screenplay about the greatest Kazakh people's poet, Jambyl. Only by relying on the national writer cadre can national film screenplays be created. Only when necessary should experienced Russian screenwriters be invited to create screenplays for republic studios, either by assisting creatively or by collaborating with local writers.

　　Strict planning in the work of the Screenplay Institute, the studio screenplay departments, and the various bureaus of the Film Department is a very important factor in improving screenplay work. We must compile a thematic plan for film screenplays for the next two years in the shortest possible time. The current tasks of Soviet cinema should be the basis of this plan, and the creative prospects of writers and directors should also be taken into account when compiling the plan. Such a plan has great organizational and disciplinary significance for screenwriters, directors, and studios.

　　In order to further develop the film industry, it is extremely necessary to solve an urgent problem: promoting young director cadres. In recent years, the problem of promoting new film actors has been solved very successfully in the film industry. A large number of talented actors have emerged in our country, who have come to the film industry from the All-Union State Film University and from theaters. It is enough to mention only the names of the actors who have appeared for the first time in films in recent years and have been successful, such as: A. Borisov, Yu. Yurovsky, G. Belov, S. Gurzo, V. Ivanov, V. Vasilyeva, V. Davydov, S. Bondarchuk, K. Luchko, S. Pilyavskaya, L. Skobina, I. Makarova. In recent years, many talented young people have filled the ranks of film photographers and artists. A large number of the most talented graduates of the screenplay department of the State Film University are currently interning at the Screenplay Institute and are engaged in screenplay work to test their creativity. The promotion of new directors to independent work, however, has been handled very badly.

　　The reason for this is primarily that many graduates of the directing department of the State Film University are not trained enough to work independently in film production.

　　Film production requires the director to have not only talent, but also great ability in organizing the artistic creation process, and knowledge of film technology. Without this, it is impossible to effectively lead a highly skilled production team (including: actors, photographers, artists, composers, costume designers, makeup artists, and other workers).

　　Experience has proven that before starting independent film production work, young directors must work sincerely and enthusiastically in a production team under the leadership of experienced directors for several years. Unfortunately, not all young comrades agree with this, and they like to think that they are not allowed to work independently because of "reinsurance" (the insurer transfers the insured to a second insurer, making them fully responsible for the policyholders, this situation is called reinsurance – translator), because they are afraid that they will gamble with the state's huge expenditure of funds.

　　Educating and promoting new director cadres is the glorious and noble task of the old and experienced film masters. These experienced masters should carefully and enthusiastically cultivate young cadres, and should recommend them to independent work in a timely manner, without letting them "ferment and overheat." When young filmmakers work independently, film masters should also provide creative assistance.

　　Currently, landscape films and documentary film sketches have great significance. This is completely obvious. Before our eyes, there are the greatest changes in the country, changes not only in the economic, cultural, and customs aspects, but also in the natural world. As masters of their own country, the Soviet people want to see and know all this. Only highly expressive films can satisfy this legitimate desire of the Soviet people. But in the creation of landscape films and documentary film sketches, there are many major shortcomings and serious failures. Not all directors understand the importance of this style, and often treat the creation of this type of film as a secondary and trivial matter. The reason why director I. Annensky created a very bad landscape film about the capital of Ukraine—Kiev—(in this film, the appearance of one of the famous and most beautiful Soviet cities is very lacking in expressiveness and very simple) is precisely here. Director Ya. Blyakh also treated the creation of the film "Caspian Fishermen" so simply.

　　This year, it is planned to release forty-five color documentaries and color landscape films. In particular, documentaries about the various federal and many autonomous republics are to be created. The task of these films is to express the multifaceted life and heroic courage of the Soviet people—who are effectively building a new, communist society—in their work.

　　The Soviet people and their creative activities in transforming nature and transforming the economy should be the focus of attention of landscape film creators. Films of this style, which are permeated with the great ideas of the present day, are politically purposeful, and ideologically oriented, should be responsible for cultivating a deep love for our beautiful motherland in the audience, inspiring a sense of pride in our victory, and disseminating the experience and achievements of the advancing Soviet people.

　　The situation regarding the development of theoretical and critical work is also not good. There is currently an imbalance between the ideological and creative level reached by film art and the current state of film criticism.

　　In the post-war years, very interesting and important creative processes and phenomena have occurred in Soviet film art, and these need to be studied and summarized theoretically. For example, the formation and effective development of new film styles (art documentaries, art science films), and the widespread use of color as a new means of expression in film—can be attributed to the above phenomena. But many critics and theorists limit themselves to commenting on film screenplays and films with superficial words, and clumsily summarize the creative experience of film masters. The handling of general aesthetic issues of film art—about its party spirit and popular nature, about socialist realism and romanticism, about form and content—is also very clumsy.

　　The reason for this is not only the small number of film critics and theorists, but mainly the lack of guidance from the film department and general organizations (the film group of the Soviet Writers' Association, the Art History Society of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the editorial department of the magazine "Film Art," and the newspaper "Soviet Art") on the work of critics and theorists.

　　In order to further improve the ideological and artistic level of film art, and to overcome the serious shortcomings in the film industry more quickly, it is necessary to develop criticism and self-criticism in every way. It is necessary to resolutely fight against those who obstruct criticism, and to reward in every way those who sincerely and honestly hope to help film art move forward with their criticism, and who bravely and truthfully expose the shortcomings in our work. We should always remember Comrade Stalin's instructions: "Without a struggle of opinions, without freedom of criticism, no science can develop and succeed." Therefore, creative discussion forums and meetings for the free exchange of opinions on important issues in film should be organized frequently. It is necessary to revitalize the work of the "Film Actors' House" and to revitalize the work of the "Film Actors' House" branches in the studios.

　　Our leaders should listen more carefully to the criticisms of ordinary workers, go to businesses, factories, and production teams more often to better understand their cadres, and strengthen the backward parts with talented workers who have been tested in a timely manner. We now have every possibility to further improve the ideological and artistic level of Soviet film art, and to actively improve the work of all departments of the film industry.

　　At present, our country is conducting peace signatures with great enthusiasm, and our workers are indignantly branding the American aggressors who invaded Korea with shame. At this time, the sacred duty of film workers is to stand at the forefront of the warriors fighting for peace. The best contribution of film workers in the cause of defending peace will be: their moving work of creating new highly artistic films—films that bring the ideas of Lenin and Stalin to hundreds of millions of workers.

　　我们的缺点和克服的途径
    苏联电影事业部部长  波尔沙科夫
    联共（布）中央历史性的诸决定，特别是关于影片《灿烂生活》的决议，在苏联电影艺术工作者面前展开了新的创作水平，新的发展道路。
    从发表这些决定的时间起，已经度过几乎四年了，现下我们看到这些决定在苏联电影的整个生活上，已给予如何巨大而有成效的影响。
    苏联电影艺术按照联共中央所指示的道路而前进，它已经得到了新的成功。编剧家、导演家、演员、摄影师、美术家和作曲家的技术在逐年成长着改善着。我们的影片，在思想内容上，变成越发深刻，在艺术形式上，越发完整了。彩色电影得到了广泛的流传——现下所发行的一切影片中，一多半是带色的。但是，我们的电影还有许多未解决的问题和重大的缺点，在阻碍我们前进。
    在我们工作中，最重大的缺点之一，便是还继续制出了品质低劣的影片。苏联观众合法而正当地向我们要求——所有发行的影片要有高度品质。可是，若干导演家却创作了在思想和艺术上庸俗而拙劣的影片，例如，《阿里且特上山记》（导演：董斯考依）便是这样。
    联共中央在关于《灿烂生活》的决议里，曾指出：“苏联的观众成长了，他们的文化问题，文化要求扩大了，而党和政府也将于今后在人民身上培养优良的审美力和对艺术作品的高度要求。”
    这便是说，苏联电影工作者的任务是在于：专门生产高度品质的影片。为了达到这个目的，不仅需要提高创制影片的整个创作团体——首先是制片兼导演的责任感，而且还要加强制造每部片子时的监督。最近几年的经验证明了：把管理工作组织得越精细、越好，就越能保证影片免于失败和产生缺陷。关于这一点，影片《亚力山大·波波夫》的创制经过，实在是一个教训。该片的制片工作起初是委托导演勒·特拉乌柏格和斯·蒂莫森科来进行的。在审查他们所拍摄的最初若干场面的时候，电影部的艺术会议和领导者们发现了该片的导演们不能保证：创造关于这位伟大的无线电发明家的爱国主义影片。失败的导演们被新的制片人拉波波尔特和爱塞孟特代替之后，如众所周知，该片结果成为高度艺术的，深刻的爱国主义的影片了。
    应当用各种方法改善制片的监督与监察制度。这种监督不仅仅对年轻的导演家们需要，就是对有经验的，有功勋的大师们（他们也难保没有错误和失败）也需要。特别是，拙劣的影片《阿里且特上山记》之所以出现，也可以由对导演工作的监督不够，加以部分的说明。制片厂和电影部认为董斯考依是个有经验的大制片家，他所制的片子是具有高度水准的，因此，对于他的工作，就很少监督。这一个例子，再一次使我们相信：即使有丰富的专门的经验也不免于创作的失败和错误。
    拍摄影片的精密监督工作，首先应该在制片厂组织起来。为此，就必须使制片厂的艺术会议积极工作，实行有系统地审查已经拍摄的影片材料，而且把审查的结论交给制片厂的负责人。
    这种监督工作，决不是使导演和整个摄制组脱卸委托给他们的业务责任，此乃自明之理。而且，这种监督工作应当这样组织起来，让它成为对摄制组经常在创作上协助的形式之一。
    在剧本工作方面，还是有若干大的缺点。不错，最近曾经创造了好些个独创性的高度思想性的剧本，如：巴甫连柯和齐乌列里的《攻克柏林》，波果金的《库班哥萨克》，巴巴夫的《巴甫洛夫》，罗日克夫和波梅斯契可夫的《西伯利亚交响曲》，莫·斯米尔诺瓦的《乡村女教师》等等。
    可是，不幸的是：这样的剧本非常少。而我们特别少的是关于英勇的苏联工人阶级劳动功绩、关于生产革新家、关于消除精神劳动与体力劳动的界线的剧本。而工作于喜剧片的导演们，也感到了好剧本的严重缺乏。
    目前的苏联电影，在创造高度品质的影片方面，得到了若干成就；积极的提高了电影的领导工作者与创作工作者的责任感。因此，现在具有一切条件，在不降低质量的情形下，扩大影片发行的数量。可是，为了扩大影片发行数量，就不仅需要熟练的、有经验的导演干部和演员干部，而且，主要的是需要非常有价值的，高度品质的电影剧本。
    在各加盟共和国里，关于电影剧本工作，搞得非常坏。若干共和国电影部长们，对于解决这一最重要的问题，抱着不正确的，依赖的态度。他们好这样想：各民族电影制片厂的剧本应当由莫斯科的剧本研究所供给，因此，关于教育民族的编剧干部，关于推进民族电影剧本的工作，就完全不操心了。
    塔什干、叶列宛、明斯科、巴钦斯科电影制片厂的剧本一向由莫斯科作家供给，其原因也正是这样。这种情况不能认为是正常的。在所有这些共和国里，有着民族的天才文学作家与创作家的大批干部。各共和国的任务是引导当地作家的力量为电影工作，而且给他们必需的创作上的帮助。
    给予各种方法的帮助以便发展各加盟共和国里民族电影剧本工作——这是苏联电影部剧本研究所的基本的主要的任务。在创造高度性思想的剧本方面，各民族作家和俄罗斯作家有成效的合作的例子，已经有不少了。例如，哈萨克作家塔日巴叶夫在创作上和波果金合作，于是写成了关于最伟大的哈萨克人民诗人江布尔的优良剧本。只有依靠各民族的作家干部才能创造民族的电影剧本。只是在必需的情形下，才应当邀请有经验的俄罗斯剧作家去为各共和国制片厂创作剧本，其方式，或者是在创作上协助，或者和当地作家合作。
    剧本研究所，制片厂剧本科和电影部各局工作中严格的计划性，乃是改善剧本工作的非常重要的因素。我们必须于最短期间，编造最近两年电影剧本的主题计划。苏联电影当前的任务，应当是该计划的基础，而在编造计划的时候，还要顾虑到作家与导演的创作远景。这样的计划，对于剧本作家、导演和制片厂，都有着很大组织的和纪律的意义。
    为了进一步发展电影事业，极端需要解决一个迫切的问题：提拔年轻的导演干部。近年来，在电影事业中，曾经很成功地解决了提拔新的电影演员的问题。在我们这儿，出现了一大批天资聪颖的演员，他们是从全苏联国家电影大学和从剧场来到电影界的。我们只提出近年来初次然而成功地在影片里出现的演员名字，就够了，如：阿·波里索夫、犹·犹洛夫斯基、格·别洛夫、斯·古尔佐、弗·依瓦诺夫、弗·瓦西烈瓦、弗·达维多夫、斯·邦达尔楚克、克·卢契科、斯·皮亮夫斯卡娅、勒·斯各宾娜、伊·马卡洛瓦。近年来，许多有才干的青年充实了电影摄影师和美术家的行列。国立电影大学剧本系一大批最有才干的毕业生，现下正在剧本研究所见习，而且从事剧本工作，来试验自己的创作力。提拔新导演去独立工作，这事情却搞得很坏。
    原因首先是在于：国立电影大学导演系的许多毕业生，训练得不足以在创制影片方面，独立工作。
    创制影片，这一工作，要求导演：不仅要有天才，而且，在艺术创作过程的组织方面要有巨大的才能，要有电影技术的知识。非此，即不能有成效地领导高度熟练的摄制组（其中包括：演员、摄影师、美术家、作曲家、服装师、化装师、和别的工作者）。
    经验证明了：在开始独立制片工作之前，年轻的导演家必须在有经验的导演家领导之下，诚恳而热心地在摄制组工作几年。令人惋惜的是，并非所有的年轻同志都同意这一点，而且他们好这样想：不允许他们独立工作，是因为“转保险”（保险者将被保险者让于第二个保险者，令其对于保户负完全责任，这种情形，称为转保险——译者），是因为害怕他们用国家资财的巨额开销，孤注一掷。
    教育和提拔新的导演干部，这是年老而有经验的电影大师的光荣的，高尚的任务。这些有经验的大师应当谨慎而热心地培育年轻干部，而且，应当适时地推荐他们去独立工作，勿使“发酵和过热”。当年轻的制片家独立工作的时候，电影大师们还要给予创作上的帮忙。
    目前，风景片和记录性的电影速写，有着巨大的意义。这是完全明显的。在我们眼前，出现了国内最伟大的变革，这种变革不仅是经济上的、文化上的、习俗上的，而且也是自然界中的变革。作为自己国家主人的苏联人，希望看见和知道这一切。只是具有极大表现力的电影才能满足苏联人民这种合法的愿望。但是在创造风景片和记录性电影速写的时候，却有着许多重大的缺点和严重的失败。并非所有导演都理解这种样式的重要性，而且，常常对待这种影片的创制，有如对待次要的和轻微的事情那样。导演伊·安年斯基所以创制了关于乌克兰首都——基辅——一套非常坏的风景片（在这影片里，非常缺乏表现力和非常简陋地表现了出名的和最优美的苏联城市之一的面貌）其原因，就正在这里。导演雅·布料赫也是这样简陋地对待影片《里海渔夫》的创制的。
    今年计划发行四十五部彩色记录片和彩色风景片。特别是要创制关于各联邦和许多自治共和国的记录片。这些影片的任务是表现苏联人民——他们正在有成效地建设新的、共产主义社会——的多方面的生活和劳动的英勇果敢。
    苏联人民和他们在改造自然改造经济方面的创造的活动，应当是风景片创作者注意之中心。渗透着当代伟大思想的、政治上有目的的、思想上有方向的这种样式的影片，应负责在观众身上培养对我们优美祖国的深切热爱，鼓舞对我们胜利的高傲之感，传播前进的苏联人民的经验与成就。
    关于展开理论与批评工作，情形也不好。现在电影艺术所达到的思想创作水平，与当前影评的情形，两者之间，形成了不平衡的状态。
    战后的年份，在苏联电影艺术里，发生了非常有趣而重要的创作过程和现象，这些都需要在理论上研究和概括的。例如，新的电影样式（艺术记录片、艺术科学片）的形成和有成效的发展，广泛运用色彩作为电影的一种新的表现手段——都可以归到上述现象之内。但是有许多批评家和理论家只限于用浮浅的文字评论电影剧本和影片，而且拙劣地概括着电影大师们的创作经验。处理电影艺术的一般美学问题——关于它的党性与人民性、关于社会主义现实主义和浪漫主义、关于形式和内容——也是非常之拙劣。
    其原因不仅是电影批评家与理论家人员少，而且主要的是电影部与一般的组织（苏联作家协会电影组、苏联科学院艺术史学会、《电影艺术》杂志社和《苏联艺术》报社）对批评家与理论家的工作，缺乏指导。
    为了更加提高电影艺术的思想与艺术水平，为了更迅速地克服电影事业中所具有的严重缺点，必需用一切方法展开批评与自我批评。必需与阻遏批评的人们坚决斗争，必需百般奖励这些人——他诚恳而正直地希望用自己的批评帮助电影艺术前进，他勇敢而真实地揭露我们工作中的缺点。我们应当时刻地记住斯大林同志的指示：“没有意见的斗争，没有批评的自由，任何科学也不能发展和成功。”因此，应该时常组织创作讨论会和组织关于电影重要问题自由交换意见的会议。必需使“电影演员之家”的工作活跃起来和使“电影演员之家”在制片厂的支部工作活跃起来。
    我们领导者们应当更细心地倾听普通工作者的批评，更经常地到营业中、厂房里、摄制组里更好地了解自己的干部，适时地用考验过的有才干的工作者加强落后的部分。我们现在具备一切可能，更加提高苏联电影艺术的思想与艺术水平，和积极改善电影事业所有部门的工作。
    目前，我国正以极大热情进行和平签名，我国劳动者正以愤慨之心在侵犯朝鲜的美国侵略者身上，打下羞辱的烙印，在这时候，电影工作者神圣的义务便是站在争取和平的战士们的最前列。在保卫和平的事业中，电影工作者们最好的贡献将是：他们创造新的高度艺术影片——这种影片把列宁斯大林的思想带给千百万劳动者——的动人的工作。
