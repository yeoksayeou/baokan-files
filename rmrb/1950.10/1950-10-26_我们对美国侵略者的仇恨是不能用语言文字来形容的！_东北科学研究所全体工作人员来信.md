To the People's Daily in Beijing, and forwarded to
Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai:

We, all the scientific workers, workers, and staff of the Northeast Institute of Science, having heard of the crimes of American imperialist military aircraft repeatedly conducting reconnaissance over our airspace in Korea, dropping bombs and injuring our compatriots, our hatred for the American invaders cannot be described in words. We held protest meetings in various research offices, and everyone firmly expressed their determination to turn grief and indignation into strength, support your statement, respond to all the government's calls, step up research work, and complete tasks ahead of schedule. We also held a protest and accusation meeting attended by more than a thousand people from the entire institute. At the meeting, more than a thousand iron fists were raised simultaneously, and slogans such as "Resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement!", "Support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan!", and "Blood debt must be repaid with blood!" were so loud! We have a clearer understanding of the hideous face of American imperialism, and we are more united! We hereby submit the following guarantees and requests to you:

1.  Resolutely support your statement, oppose the aggressive crimes of American imperialism, and request the government to take further effective measures to counter the crimes of American imperialism.

2.  We are determined to redouble our efforts to complete the tasks assigned to us by the state. We will carry out our research work to strengthen national defense and economic construction, and be prepared to meet any new tasks assigned to us by the state, fulfilling our sacred duty as scientific workers to defend the motherland and safeguard world peace.

All 1,150 staff members of the Northeast Institute of Science.
