　　Zhejiang Province Convenes Judicial Conference
    Emphasizing Suppression of Counter-Revolutionary Activities
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Zhejiang Province Judicial Conference, which began in late September, concluded on the 10th of this month after fourteen days of discussion. More than twenty staff members participated in the conference, including representatives from provincial sub-courts in various regions, municipal courts, and colleagues from various departments of the provincial court. In addition to conveying the basic spirit and certain decisions of the National and East China Judicial Conferences, the meeting focused on unifying viewpoints and discussing the direction and tasks of judicial work. Participants first studied and understood the significant meaning of Vice Premier Dong Biwu's instruction that "Judicial work is the sharpest weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship." The type of state determines the type of law needed; a country without law and discipline is inconceivable. As a result, everyone further recognized the importance of the work they were undertaking. The conference criticized the tendency of some regional leaders to not value judicial work, and unanimously agreed that it was necessary to change the incorrect view that judicial work was optional. At the same time, every judicial worker must strengthen their study of revolutionary theory, clearly understand the class nature of law, establish a Marxist-Leninist legal perspective, and ideologically eliminate the influence of the pseudo "Six Codes." When discussing the central task of current judicial work, it was emphasized that the People's Courts must focus their main efforts on the work of the People's Tribunals. Each court must also, through its own trial tasks, promptly suppress counter-revolutionary forces' sabotage of the country. Various attitudes of belittling and excusing acts of sabotage were criticized, and in connection with the current work of protecting warehouses, etc., it was clearly recognized that judicial work must safeguard the country's economic construction tasks.
    On the issue of trials, the conference studied the role of judicial work in the people's democratic dictatorship and the democratic spirit of the trial system. Specific experiences were exchanged regarding the principles of combining suppression with leniency, combining trials with mediation, as well as the mass line trial method and the fact-based, investigative research trial method.
    On the issue of prisons and detention centers, the different essence of the old and new prisons was analyzed, and it was recognized that prisons and detention centers of the People's Republic of China must implement the principle of combining punishment and control with education and reform. The conference also agreed to the plan proposed by the Provincial Court to establish labor reform centers by region and to create typical models with a focus on local socio-economic conditions.
    This conference particularly emphasized the work of clearing backlog cases, believing that this was related to the implementation of the entire policy and must be regarded as one of the most urgent and important tasks at present. If it is not grasped and dealt with promptly, it will lead to serious consequences of becoming detached from the masses and causing chaos. The conference decided that courts in various regions should carry out focused clearing, first clearing criminal cases, and also clearing important civil cases as soon as possible, and must strive to be both good and fast, opposing the phenomenon of being hasty and perfunctory just for the sake of speed. Efforts should be made to complete the task before the implementation of land reform.

　　浙江省召开司法会议
    强调镇压反革命活动
    【本报讯】自九月下旬开始的浙江省司法会议，经十四天的研讨，已于本月十日宣告结束。参加此次会议的工作人员计有各地区省分院，市法院代表与省法院各部门工作同志二十余人，会上除传达全国和华东司法会议的基本精神和若干决定外，在讨论统一观点和司法工作的方针任务问题上，使大家首先研究与体会了董必武副总理所指示的“司法工作是人民民主专政国家最锐利的武器”的重要意义。怎样性质的国家就需要有怎样的法律与之相适应，没有法纪的国家是不堪设想的。因之大家在思想上进一步认识了自己所担任工作的重要。会议对个别地区领导上不重视司法工作的倾向加以批判，一致认为要转变若干仍然以司法工作为可有可无的不正确观点。同时每个司法工作人员必须加强学习革命理论，明确认识法律的阶级性，树立马列主义的法律观点，从思想上廓清伪“六法全书”的影响。在讨论目前司法工作的中心任务时，强调了人民法院必须以主要力量作人民法庭的工作。各院并要通过自己的审判任务，及时地镇压反革命势力对于国家的破坏。批判了各种对破坏事件抱轻视和原谅的态度，同时联系到当前保护仓库等工作，明确认识了司法工作必须保卫国家经济建设的任务。
    在审判问题上，会议研究了司法工作对于民主专政作用与审判制度的民主精神。对镇压与宽大相结合、审判与调解相结合的方针，以及群众路线的审判方式和实事求是调查研究的审判方法，都交换了具体经验。
    在监所问题上，分析了新旧监所的不同本质，认识到中华人民共和国的监所，必须实行惩罚管制与教育改造相结合的方针。会议并同意省院所提出分区设立劳动改造所的计划，并视各地社会经济条件有重点地创造典型。
    此次会议特别强调了清理积案工作，认为这是关系着整个政策的执行问题，必须当作目前异常迫切的主要工作之一。如不抓紧处理，就会酿成脱离群众，引起乱的严重后果。会议决定各地法院应进行有重点的清理，首先清理刑事案件，同时亦应尽早清理民事的重要案件，必须做到好快兼备，反对只顾快而草率从事的现象。要争取在实行土改前完成任务。
