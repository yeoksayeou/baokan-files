Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 13th: Tass news agency, Pyongyang: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Democratic Republic announced in a battle report on the morning of the 12th that the People's Army units continued to engage in fierce battles with the attacking enemy troops on all fronts.

In the Kaesong area and along the east coast, the People's Army units dealt resolute blows to the enemy troops, contained their offensive to advance north, and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 13th: Tass news agency, Pyongyang: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Democratic Republic announced in a battle report on the evening of the 12th that the People's Army continued to engage in fierce battles with the enemy troops on all fronts.

On October 9th, the enemy, under the cover of artillery and tanks, launched an offensive towards Koranpo-ri in the Kaesong area.

In this battle, the People's Army killed or wounded over a hundred enemy officers and soldiers, destroyed two enemy tanks and five trucks, and captured heavy machine guns, rifles, carbines, and other war materials.

Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The American invading troops, who occupied Seoul and Kaesong and advanced north of the "38th Parallel," have been progressing very slowly and suffering heavy losses under the strong resistance of the heroic Korean People's Army. The US military continued its northward advance after occupying Seoul on September 30th, and it took them seven days to occupy Kaesong, 65 kilometers northwest of Seoul, on October 7th. Due to the strong blows suffered by the People's Army along the way, according to Reuters, the US military had to carry out "reorganization" in Kaesong. When this US military unit crossed the "38th Parallel" and advanced north on the 9th, it immediately encountered "unexpectedly stubborn resistance" from the Korean People's Army (International News Service). Reuters also stated that the People's Army stubbornly resisted the US military's "every inch of progress." On October 9th, the US military only advanced 700 yards, and on the 10th, it only advanced one kilometer. At the same time, the People's Army made the enemy pay a heavy price for occupying every inch of land. According to Agence France-Presse on the 9th, the US military's "progress is very slow, and its losses are greater than at any time in the past two weeks." A spokesman for the 8th Regiment Headquarters of the US 1st Cavalry Division also had to admit on the 9th: "Our side (referring to the US military) has suffered numerous casualties." Facing the strong resistance and protracted war of attrition from the Korean People's Army, the American invaders have begun to feel panic. United Press reporter James said on the 9th: "For the infantry advancing forward, the war has become a harsh, frequently encountered reality again."

　　侵越“三八”线的美军遭坚强抗击损失重大
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社平壤讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部十二日晨发表战报称：人民军部队在各战线继续与进攻的敌军进行激战。
    在开城地区和东海岸一带，人民军部队予敌军以坚决打击，遏止了敌军往北推进的攻势，并使敌军遭受重大损失。
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社平壤讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部十二日晚发表战报称：人民军在各战线继续对敌军进行激战。
    十月九日，敌军在大炮和坦克的掩护下，在开城地区向高浪浦里方面发动进攻。
    在这一战役中，人民军毙伤敌军官兵百余名。击毁敌军坦克两辆、卡车五辆，并缴获了重机枪、步枪、卡宾枪及其他战争物资。
    【新华社十三日讯】侵占汉城、开城并向“三八”线以北进犯的美国侵略军，在英勇的朝鲜人民军坚强抗击下，进展十分缓滞，损失却很重大。美军在九月三十日侵占汉城后继续北犯，经七天之久，才在十月七日侵占了汉城西北六十五公里的开城。由于沿途遭受人民军的坚强打击，据路透社称，美军曾不得不在开城进行了“重新整编”。而该路美军于九日越过“三八”线北犯时，又立即遭遇到朝鲜人民军“出乎意料的顽强的抵抗”（国际新闻社）。路透社又称：人民军顽强地抗击美军“每一寸的进展”。十月九日，美军仅前进七百码，十日仅前进一公里。同时，人民军并使敌人为侵占每一寸土地付出重大代价。据法新社九日称：美军“进展很慢，其损失比两星期来的任何时期都更大”。美军第一骑兵师第八团指挥部发言人于九日也不得不承认：“我方（指美军）伤亡甚众”。面对着朝鲜人民军的坚强抗击与长期的消耗战，美国侵略者已开始感觉恐慌。合众社记者詹姆士九日说：“对向前推进的步兵来说，战争又变成严酷的、经常遇见的现实了”。
