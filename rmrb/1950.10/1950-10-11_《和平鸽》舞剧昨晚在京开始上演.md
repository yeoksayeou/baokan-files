The ballet "Peace Dove," performed by the Dance Troupe of the Central Academy of Drama, after more than forty days of rehearsal and preparation, premiered last night, the 10th, at the Youth Palace Theater in Beijing. Before the performance began, Ding Zan, Secretary-General of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace, and representatives of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters presented flowers and flags respectively. Then, Ouyang Yuqian, President of the Central Academy of Drama (and the editor of "Peace Dove"), gave a reply. The entire audience cheered and applauded for the continuous growth of the forces defending world peace and the fact that 160 million people in China had signed the peace declaration. Throughout the performance of "Peace Dove," the audience was captivated from beginning to end.

The play has its own creations and achievements in dance, music, and stage design. For example, in the first scene, the use of ballet techniques to depict a group of beautiful, lively, enthusiastic, and determined white doves, symbolizing the warriors of peace, flying over the blue sea, with the white light of the red star lighthouse illuminating the path to peace and happiness, is a gorgeous and moving scene.

The significance of the "Peace Dove" performance is very important. It truly expresses the emotions of the people and the demands of the times. The people of China, as well as the people of the world, are feeling the threat of war incited by the imperialists. Therefore, it will be loved by the people of the world who oppose war and desire peace.

　　《和平鸽》舞剧
      昨晚在京开始上演
    中央戏剧学院舞蹈团演出的舞剧《和平鸽》经四十余日的排演准备，已于十日晚在京市青年宫剧场开始上演。于开演前由中国保卫世界和平大会委员会秘书长丁瓒及中苏友好协会总会代表先后分别赠花、赠旗，继由中央戏剧学院院长欧阳予倩（和平鸽编者）致答词；全场并为保卫世界和平力量不断的增长；中国有一亿六千万人在和平宣言上签名而欢呼鼓掌。在《和平鸽》的上演中，从头至尾始终吸引着观众。
    该剧无论在舞蹈、音乐或舞台布置上都有它的创造与成就。像在第一场运用芭蕾舞的技术表现一群美丽、活泼、热情而又坚定的白色鸽子，象征着和平的战士，飞翔在蓝色的海上；红星的灯塔闪出白色的光芒指示着和平幸福的道路，更是一个艳丽而动人的场面。
    《和平鸽》演出的意义是非常重大的，它真实的表现了人民的情感和时代的要求，现在的中国人民以及全世界人民同样在感受着帝国主义者鼓动的战争威胁着，因之，它将会得到全世界反对战争渴望和平的人民的热爱。
