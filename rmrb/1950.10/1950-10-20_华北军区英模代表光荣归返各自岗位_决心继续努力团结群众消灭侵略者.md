Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Forty-six hero and model representatives from the North China Military Region have gloriously returned to their respective units before the 10th of this month. When combat hero Chai Erren, militia hero Wang Gensheng, labor model Zhang Tingxiang, and others from the Suiyuan Military Region arrived at the military region, more than 700 people, including the heads of the Suiyuan Provincial Military Region and the provincial government, as well as representatives from various agencies and organizations, rushed to the station to welcome them. The units directly under the military region also held a welcome meeting, inviting the representatives to deliver reports. When the representatives spoke of meeting Chairman Mao in Beijing and that Chairman Mao was in very good health, thunderous applause erupted in the venue. Combat hero Fan Baoku from the Chahar Provincial Military Region, lone hero Wang Yougen from a certain army, labor model Zhang Benliang, and militia hero Yuan Xiang from the Hebei Military Region all gave reports at welcome meetings held in their respective units. In addition to reporting on the grand occasion of the two conferences, they unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's orders, continue to work hard in their posts, and unite the masses. Artillery hero Li Qiyuan said at the welcome meeting of the artillery unit: "American imperialism is flaunting its teeth and claws, expanding its war of aggression; we must polish our guns and artillery, fully prepare our work, and resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the invaders who dare to invade our motherland." The leaders of the unit also spoke at the welcome meeting, encouraging the hero and model individuals to not be arrogant or impatient, and to continue to lead the masses forward; and called on all commanders and fighters to learn from the hero and model individuals, launch revolutionary competitions, cultivate a large number of heroes and models, and jointly realize Chairman Mao's instructions and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's orders. When the representatives returned to their respective units, the Political Department of the North China Military Region issued a general instruction to its subordinates to widely carry out the revolutionary heroism movement, requiring the political organs at all levels of the troops to regard the commendation of heroes and models as one of the regular and important tasks.
