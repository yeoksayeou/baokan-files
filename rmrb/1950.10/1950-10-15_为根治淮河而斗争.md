　　Struggle to Fundamentally Control the Huai River
　　This year, most of the rivers in the country have successfully passed the flood season and basically ensured local safety and agricultural harvests through the vigorous repair and defense efforts of the people. Only the Huai River basin experienced severe flooding due to the exceptionally large floods, resulting in more than 40 million mu of flooded land and 13 million people affected in Henan and Anhui provinces, which is a significant loss to the people's economy.
　　The reason for such a major flood disaster in the Huai River basin this year is the exceptionally large flood. The characteristic of the natural environment in the Huai River basin is that the climate changes within the basin are generally consistent, and concentrated rainstorms often occur simultaneously upstream and downstream. The tributaries in the upper and middle reaches converge into the Huai River at several points, such as Honghekou, Sanhejian, and Zhengyangguan, like spokes on a wheel. The floods of the tributaries often swell and converge simultaneously, which the Huai River mainstream cannot discharge. Furthermore, the outlet to the sea in the lower reaches of the Huai River has been completely silted up due to the Yellow River repeatedly seizing the Huai River in the past. The floodwaters all gather in Hongze Lake and then flow into the Yangtze River through Gaobao, Shaobo, and other lakes via the Grand Canal. This not only restricts the discharge capacity but also threatens the safety of northern Jiangsu. Such a river, blocked upstream and downstream, is prone to flooding. Moreover, the digging of the levee at Huayuankou by the Kuomintang reactionaries in 1938 caused the Yellow River to overflow southward. For nine years, the muddy waters of the Yellow River flowed into the Yangtze River via the Huai River. Due to the flooding and silting of the Yellow River, the Huai River system became even more chaotic, and the riverbed topography underwent significant changes. The mouths of the tributaries were blocked by the backflow of the Yellow River, resulting in the phenomenon of "major floods in heavy rain and minor floods in light rain" for more than ten years. After the Huaihai Campaign, the Huai River basin was completely liberated. Starting last winter, the People's Government began flood control projects on the Huai River. However, because the riverbed topography of the Huai River basin had changed, more detailed preparations were necessary before undertaking fundamental治理. Therefore, at that time, on the one hand, the dikes were repaired and partial dredging was carried out according to the floods of last year and 1931, and on the other hand, reconnaissance and surveying were started to formulate more accurate plans. This year, however, an unprecedented flood in decades was encountered. This year, the rainfall in the Huai River basin was not only heavy, but the duration of rainfall was more concentrated than in 1931. From June 26 to the end of July, the rainfall in Bengbu was 537 millimeters, exceeding that of 1931 by 111 millimeters, and the rainfall in Zhengyangguan was 657 millimeters, exceeding that of 1931 by 161 millimeters. The water level in Bengbu and its upstream areas exceeded that of 1931 by 7 to 10 centimeters, and the river dikes could not contain and discharge the water, resulting in overflows and breaches everywhere. The tributaries and low-lying areas along the river also suffered disasters due to poor drainage. Although the local governments and water conservancy departments of Henan and Anhui provinces made every effort to rescue and reduce some of the disasters, the disaster situation is still very serious.
　　In order to rescue the Huai River flood, the Central People's Government has successively allocated more than 100 million jin of food, 10 million jin of salt, 520,000 tons of coal, and 35 billion yuan in seed loans for emergency relief. At the same time, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, the fundamental control of the Huai River will begin from now on. This huge project has been studied and formulated in terms of principles and plans at a meeting convened by the Central Ministry of Water Resources, and a decision has been made by the Government Administration Council to combine storage and discharge to fundamentally eliminate the flood disaster of the Huai River. According to this decision, reservoirs will be built in the upper reaches of the Huai River and soil and water conservation will be promoted, with the long-term goals of intercepting floods and developing water conservancy. At present, on the one hand, efforts should be made to use valleys and depressions to intercept floods, and on the other hand, appropriate flood control and dredging should be carried out on the principle of taking into account the interests of the residents in the middle and lower reaches. In the middle reaches of the Huai River, both storage and discharge are equally important. According to the maximum flood flow, lakes and depressions should be used to intercept the floodwaters of the main and tributaries, and the river channels should be straightened to discharge all the floodwaters other than those intercepted. In the lower reaches of the Huai River, a waterway to the sea should be opened up to facilitate discharge. At the same time, the dikes of the Grand Canal should be consolidated to ensure safety. Hongze Lake will still be used to regulate the water volume in the middle and lower reaches, and ditches should be opened up in key areas in the upper and middle reaches to prevent internal涝 and ensure the wheat harvest next spring.
　　The plan for this project is formulated based on current needs and combined with long-term interests. It aims to immediately reduce the area that may be affected by disasters in the upper and middle reaches, while also taking into account the time required to open up the discharge channel in the lower reaches. The ultimate goal is to not only eliminate floods but also take into account the long-term needs of drought prevention and water conservancy development. The scale of this project, based on rough estimates, requires more than 200 million cubic meters of earthwork alone, and also requires the implementation of some technically complex projects. Therefore, this project is indeed a very complex and arduous one. We must fully estimate various difficult conditions and vigorously carry out organizational and preparatory work to create conditions and overcome difficulties. However, we should also have full confidence in completing this huge task. Because after the widespread repair and defense of rivers across the country this year, we have the conditions to concentrate the nation's strength and focus on key work. In the next two to three years, restoring and developing agricultural production is one of the primary goals of national construction. The government has decided to devote even greater efforts to water conservancy projects to address the root causes. The Central People's Government has also decided that the three provinces of Henan, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu will focus on governing the Huai River next year. Therefore, our water conservancy work conditions this year are far better than last year. Based on last year, we completed such a huge water conservancy project this year. Based on this year, we will definitely be able to complete even greater tasks. However, in the course of the work, there are several key issues that must be carefully grasped.
　　First, we must strengthen organizational leadership and preparatory work. Because the scale of this project is very large and involves the interests of the masses in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, the Government Administration Council has decided to establish a Huai River Management Committee and command headquarters in the three provinces to strengthen unified leadership. However, because the project is vast and requires a large number of cadres, especially with the urgency of time, the existing number of technical cadres in the Huai River Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau is insufficient, and many survey and investigation works need to be carried out urgently. Therefore, the allocation and deployment of cadres is still a major issue. In addition to the East China and Central South Ministry of Water Resources, the Huai River Water Conservancy Bureau, and the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, which should allocate existing cadres to carry out urgent work as soon as possible, preparations should also be made quickly on how to conscript the necessary cadres and how to supplement and train lower-level technical cadres. The departments of the provinces and regions designated to dispatch cadres to assist in the Huai River management work must also recognize the severity of the Huai River flood disaster and that Huai River management is one of the key tasks urgently needed by the country, select outstanding cadres, and actively support this work. Through this year's water conservancy spring repair project, cadres at all levels have gained some experience in carrying out water conservancy projects. However, they still feel insufficient experience for such a large-scale project. The project must undergo specific measurements, the migrant workers must be well organized, the work sections must be divided, the measurement of work volume, the distribution of food, and the preparation of migrant workers' food, accommodation, and hygiene must all be actively prepared and meticulously organized based on this year's experience. The preparation of work-related food is also a major issue for carrying out such a large project. In addition to the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu actively planning, relevant departments should also assist in solving the problem.
　　Second, the projects in the upper, middle, and lower reaches must take care of each other and cooperate with each other. The治理 of a river must take into account both the upper and lower reaches. The治理 of the Huai River is related to the interests of the three provinces. The flood storage and drainage in the upper and middle reaches and the expansion of the discharge channel in the lower reaches must be mutually considered. This spirit has been emphasized in the decision of the Government Administration Council as the guiding principle for the entire Huai River治理 plan. In the Huai River治理 meeting convened by the Ministry of Water Resources, based on this spirit, a common plan and steps were formulated for the scale and urgency of various projects in the upper, middle, and lower reaches, which were uniformly controlled by the Huai River治理 Committee. However, because the scale of this project is too large, some projects must be carried out in advance in order to provide work relief. Therefore, this spirit of mutual cooperation must also be conveyed to governments at all levels and local masses in the three provinces as a principle to be jointly observed. The projects carried out under the leadership of local governments must also be based on the overall principle, with planning and leadership, so as not to dig and block乱and disrupt the entire plan. The mountain reservoirs in the upper reaches should be selected at multiple sites and accelerated to be built, because they are permanent water conservancy projects and have benefits for both flood control and drought prevention. The flood storage projects in lakes and depressions in the upper and middle reaches must also be carried out seriously, because this is the only key to reducing the disaster area before the completion of the upstream reservoirs and the downstream sea channel. It is necessary to sacrifice a few lakes and low-lying areas in order to avoid flooding in most areas. In the past, the situation in the northern Anhui area was that floods occurred when it rained, and droughts occurred when it did not rain. In the past, some places often "争田与湖" for immediate interests, which was a very wrong practice. Of course, the water storage capacity of the lakes along the Huai River has been greatly reduced after years of siltation. However, as far as the plan to fundamentally治Huai River is concerned, even after the completion of the downstream sea channel, it is still necessary to retain a certain number of lakes for drainage and storage in order to permanently eliminate floods and droughts. This is the most reasonable and economical approach. The opening up of the sea channel in the lower reaches is a project related to long-term interests, and the selection of lines and design must be cautious. In particular, the water flow time of the Huai River flood is long, and the new river channel must be excavated and dikes must be built to ensure safety. Therefore, the amount of earthwork is huge, and the work of relocating residents is not something that can be completed in one year. Therefore, the Government Administration Council decided that the first phase of the sea channel project will be completed in 1951, and water will be released during the flood season in 1952; next year, the Huai River will still temporarily use the Jianghuai channel as the drainage outlet. It is also stipulated that the maximum discharge capacity of Hongze Lake into the Yangtze River should be 8,500 cubic meters per second, which is 2,000 cubic meters per second higher than the maximum flood period this year. From all aspects, this decision is completely correct. On the one hand, it can avoid the hasty opening of hundreds of kilometers of new river channels, insufficient preparation, and huge waste of manpower and material resources; on the other hand, increasing the discharge into the Yangtze River also fully takes into account the water drainage requirements of the upper and middle reaches. In the event of simultaneous flooding of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, making drainage difficult, it will of course still be necessary to open the Guihai Dam to protect the safety of the Grand Canal堤, but this is a very accidental event. We should repair the channels and related culverts and dams entering the sea in the Lixiahe area before the flood season, and plant early rice in the Lixiahe area to plan and reduce this万一possible disaster.
　　Third, the issue of combining engineering and disaster relief. According to the experience of this year's construction, engineering and disaster relief should be combined, but there should also be distinctions. All projects, except for those with higher technical requirements, should implement work relief. However, work relief must be based on engineering as the main focus, and the quantity and quality of the engineering must be guaranteed. Victims who cannot participate in the project should be provided with separate relief. This is the necessary distinction between work relief and relief. If this principle cannot be grasped, it is easy to create confusion and make it impossible to complete both the engineering and disaster relief tasks well. In the winter repair last year and the spring repair project this year, some places did not organize the victims carefully. Those without labor were often brought to the堤 together, which affected the progress of the project and work efficiency, and there was also a great waste of工粮. For victims who cannot work, because their work efficiency is low, the工粮 they receive is often not enough to eat, and there is no question of relief. Conversely, in some areas, because the labor force is整齐 and well-organized, the income of the migrant workers, in addition to solving their own problems, can also support their families. These experiences and lessons must be remembered. In terms of guiding ideology, if engineering is not the main focus, it is easy to form a tendency to only pay attention to quantity and not quality, so that water conservancy projects cannot generate the due effectiveness. Therefore, in the future construction, cadres in charge at all levels must deeply understand and be good at grasping the principle of combining and distinguishing between engineering and relief.
　　The Huai River flood is a historical disaster. But in the hands of the people's政权, we will not only fundamentally eliminate this historical disaster, but also begin long-term water conservancy projects. The cadres and masses of the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu should actively mobilize and, under the unified leadership of the Huai River治理 Committee, struggle to complete this great Huai River治理 task.

　　为根治淮河而斗争
    今年全国多数河流，经过人民的大力修防，都已胜利度过汛期，基本保证了地方安全与农业的丰收。惟有淮河流域则因洪水特大，仍然发生了严重的水灾。豫皖境内淹地四千余万亩，受灾一千三百万人，这是人民经济的重大损失。
    今年淮河流域所以发生这样重大的水灾，是因为洪水特大。淮河流域自然环境的特点，是流域以内的气候变化，大体一致，上下游常常同时发生集中的暴雨。上中游各支流在洪河口、三河尖、正阳关几个地点，像车辐一样汇流入淮，各支流的洪水往往同时盛涨，同时汇集，为淮河干流所不能承泄，而淮河下游入海的出路，又因过去黄河屡次夺淮，淮河下游已完全淤塞，洪水全部汇集在洪泽湖，再由高宝邵伯等湖，经运河流入长江。这不但使泄量受到限制，并且威胁着苏北的安全。这样一条上壅下塞的河流，本来容易发生水灾。又经一九三八年国民党反动派在花园口掘堤，使黄河南泛，九年之间，黄河的浊流皆由淮河入江。由于黄河洪水的泛滥和淤垫，淮域水系更加紊乱，河道地形都有很大的变化，各支流河口受黄水的顶托倒灌，多数淤塞，于是造成十余年间“大雨大灾，小雨小灾”的现象。淮海战役之后，淮河流域已完全解放，去冬开始，人民政府已开始淮河的防洪工程，但由于淮河流域的河道地形已经变化，必须经过比较详细的准备，才能从事根本的治理，所以，在当时一方面依照去年和一九三一年的洪水，进行了修复堤防和部分的疏浚，一方面开始查勘测量，以制订比较精确的计划。今年却又遇到数十年间未有的洪水。今年淮河流域雨量既大，并且降雨的时间比一九三一年更为集中。自六月二十六日至七月底，蚌埠降雨量五三七公厘，超过一九三一年一一一公厘，正阳关降雨量六五七公厘，超过一九三一年一六一公厘。蚌埠及其上游的水位，超过一九三一年七公寸至一公尺，河道堤防不能容泄，于是到处漫溢溃决，各支流和沿河低洼，因为排水不畅，也随地成灾。虽然经过豫皖两省地方政府和水利机关全力抢救，减小了一部分灾害，但是灾情仍然十分严重。
    为了抢救淮河水灾，中央人民政府已先后拨出食粮一亿余斤，盐一千万斤，煤五十二万吨，籽种贷款三百五十亿元，进行紧急赈救。同时，根据毛主席的指示，从现在起，即开始进行淮河的根本治理。这个巨大的工程，已由中央水利部召开会议，研究制订了方针和计划，并已由政务院做出决定，要蓄泄兼筹，根本消除淮河的水患。依照这个决定，在淮河的上游，要兴建水库，推行水土保持，以拦蓄洪水和发展水利为长远目标。目前一方面要尽量利用山谷及洼地拦蓄洪水，一方面要在照顾中下游居民的利益的原则下，进行适当的防洪与疏浚。在淮河的中游，是蓄泄并重，要按照最大洪水来量，一方面利用湖泊低洼，拦蓄干支流的洪水，一方面整理河道，承泄拦蓄以外的全部洪水。在淮河的下游，则要开辟入海水道，以利宣泄。同时巩固运河堤防，以策安全。洪泽湖仍然用以调节中下游的水量，同时要在上中游有重点的开辟沟洫，以防止内涝成灾，保障明春的麦收。
    这一个工程的计划，是根据目前需要，并结合长远利益来制定的。既要立即缩小上中游可能受灾的面积，同时也要照顾下游泄水道开辟的时间。最后目标则是既要消除水灾，又要照顾防旱与兴办水利这样长远的需要。这个工程的规模，仅土工一项据粗略估计，即须二亿公方以上，并且还需要举办一些技术性较高工程，所以这个工程实在是一个十分复杂而艰巨的工程，我们必须充分估计各种困难条件，大力进行组织与准备工作，以创造条件，克服困难。但是对于完成这个巨大的任务，我们也应该具有充足的信心。因为全国河流，经过今年的普遍修防以后，我们已经有条件集中全国的力量，有重点地进行工作。今后二三年内，恢复和发展农业生产是国家建设工作中的首要目标之一，政府已决定拿出更大的力量，从事水利治本的工程。中央人民政府并已决定河南皖北苏北三个省区明年皆以治淮为中心工作。所以我们今年水利工作的条件远比去年好。在去年的基础上，我们今年完成了那样巨大的水利工程，在今年的基础上，我们一定能完成更大的任务。不过在工作进行当中，有几个关键性的问题，必须切实注意掌握。
    第一，必须加强组织领导与准备工作。由于这一个工程规模十分巨大，关系豫皖苏三省区的群众利益，政务院已经决定成立治淮委员会及三省治淮指挥部，以加强统一领导。但是因为工程浩大，需要干部的数量极多，尤其是时间迫促，淮河水利工程总局原有的技术干部数量不足，许多勘测调查工作急需进行，所以干部的调集配备，还是很大的问题。除去华东和中南水利部，淮河水利总局和豫皖苏三省区，要调配现有干部，尽先进行迫切需要的工作以外，对于如何征调必需的干部，如何补充训练低级的技术干部，也应迅速准备。被指定调派干部协助治淮工作的各省区部门，也必须认识淮河水灾的严重，治淮是国家急切需要的重点工作之一，选派优秀干部，积极支持这一工作。经过今年的水利春修工程，各级干部对于进行水利工程，已有一部分经验。但是对于这样大规模的工程仍感经验不足。工程要经过具体测量，民工要有很好的组织，划分工段，验方发粮，和民工食宿卫生的准备，都要根据今年的经验，积极筹备，细密组织。举办这样大的工程，工粮准备也是很大的事情，除去豫皖苏三省区要积极筹划以外，有关部门也应协助解决。
    第二，上中下游工程，要互相照顾，互相配合。一道河流的治理，必须上下游统筹兼顾，淮河的治理，关系三个省区的利益，上中游的蓄洪排洪，与下游泄水道的扩充，更必须互相关顾。这一种精神，政务院的决定已经强调指出，做为整个治淮计划的方针。在水利部召开的治淮会议中，又根据这一精神，对上中下游各项工程的规模大小，先后缓急，拟定了共同的方案与步骤，由治淮委员会统一掌握。但是因为这一个工程的规模过大，为了以工代赈，有些工程要先期进行，所以这种互相配合的精神，还必须传达到三省区内各级政府和地方群众，作为共同遵守的原则。由地方政府领导进行的工程，也一定要根据总的原则，有计划，有领导，才不致乱挖乱堵，紊乱了整个的计划。上游的山地蓄水库，要多选地址，加速兴办，因为这是永久性的水利工程，防洪防旱都有利益。上中游湖泊洼地的蓄洪工程，也必须认真进行，因为这是上游水库和下游入海水道完成以前，缩小灾区的唯一关键，必须牺牲少数湖泊低洼，才能免除大部地区的泛滥。过去皖北一带的情况是有雨则生水灾、无雨则生旱灾。过去，有些地方为了眼前利益，往往“与湖争田”，这是十分错误的。当然，沿淮各个湖泊经过多年淤垫，蓄水容量已大为减少，但是就根治淮河的计划来说，为永久免除水旱之灾起见，即使下游入海水道完成以后，还需要保留一定数量的湖泊，以供吐纳蓄泄之用，才是最合理最经济的办法。下游入海水道的开辟，是一个关系长久利益的工程，选线设计，均须慎重。尤其是淮河洪水的行水时间较长，新河道必须开挖河槽并修筑堤防，才能保证安全。因之土方工程数量浩大，再加迁移居民等工作，绝非一年所能完成。所以政务院决定，入海水道一九五一年先完成第一期工程，一九五二年汛期放水；淮河明年仍暂以入江水道为泄水尾闾。并规定洪泽湖入江最高泄量以八千五百秒公方为度，比今年最大洪水时期提高了二千秒公方的流量。从各方面来看，这个决定是完全正确的。一方面可以避免仓促开辟几百公里的新河道，准备不足，人力物力的巨大浪费；另一面，入江泄量提高，也充分照顾了上中游泄水的要求。万一遇到江淮并涨，宣泄困难，当然也还需要再开归海坝，以保运堤的安全，可是这是非常偶然的事情。我们应该在汛期以前修整里下河入海的港道及有关的涵洞闸坝，并在里下河地区多种早稻，以求有计划地缩小这种万一可能发生的灾害。
    第三，工程与救灾相结合问题。根据今年施工的经验，工程与救灾要相结合，又要有区别。全部工程除去技术性较高的工程以外都要实行以工代赈。但是以工代赈，一定要以工程为主，必须保证完成工程的数量与质量，凡不能参加工程的灾民，应该另外进行救济，这又是以工代赈和救济之间必要的区别。若是不能掌握这个原则，则容易造成混乱，使工程与救灾两个任务都不能很好地完成。去年冬修和今年春修工程中，有些地方对于灾民的组织很不细密，没有劳动力的也往往一齐上堤，因而影响了工程的进度和工作效率，工粮也有很大的浪费。对于不能劳动的灾民来说，因为他们的工作效率低，其所得工粮往往尚不够吃，也谈不上救济。反之，有的地区因为劳力整齐，组织细密，民工所得，除解决了自身问题外，有些并可养活家属。这些经验教训均须记取。在领导思想上，如果不以工程为主，则很容易形成只重数量不重质量的倾向，使水利工程不能发生应有的效能。所以今后在施工当中，各级负责干部必须深切体认并善于掌握工程与救济互相结合又互相区别的原则。
    淮河的水灾是一个历史性的灾害。但是到了人民政权手中，我们不但要根本消灭这个历史性的灾害，并且即将开始长期的兴利工程。豫皖苏三省的干部与群众，应积极地动员起来，在治淮委员会统一领导之下，为完成这个伟大的治淮任务而斗争。
