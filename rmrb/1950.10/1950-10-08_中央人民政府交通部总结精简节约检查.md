The Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government concluded its frugality and savings inspection.

[Reported by this newspaper] The Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government began its frugality and savings inspection in mid-July. The inspection was conducted by a frugality and savings inspection group consisting of the Minister, the Director and Deputy Directors of the General Office, and the responsible personnel from each bureau and division. A detailed plan for the inspection was drawn up, and all personnel studied the documents on frugality and savings. Democracy was promoted, and criticism and self-criticism were carried out, revealing many problems. The various groups put forward more than a hundred suggestions. The finance (responsible for inspecting operating expenses), materials (responsible for inspecting housing, furniture, office expenses, etc.), and personnel (responsible for inspecting staffing and work attitude) inspection groups conducted research and inspection and prepared reports, which were then summarized by the leadership. This summary has been approved by the State Council's Frugality and Savings Inspection Group meeting. It is published as follows:

In the area of Finance

The financial inspection mainly summarized various wasteful practices in several transportation engineering projects. The inspection covered nine items: (1) Inspection of the Pukou Wharf Repair Project: This project basically completed its tasks and achieved significant results; however, due to insufficient preparation and experience, inadequate planning, design, procurement of materials, and organization and management, even errors, caused significant waste. The project had two main parts: "rectification" and "bank protection." (The content of the rectification project was dredging and managing the riverbed to guide the main current.) In the bank protection project, the "sunken raft" project failed due to improper raft bed design, untimely supply of equipment, and irregular towing of equipment, which made it difficult to move and delayed the time, causing the dry season to pass, and the deep and rapid water made it difficult to place. Some of the merchants defaulted on the purchase of small timber and reed materials (although they are being pursued, the results are minimal), some were purchased from afar at high prices, and some did not meet specifications. In addition, the purchased Portland cement solidified and was returned, rendering the purchased yellow sand useless. The total loss was over 943.2 million yuan (not including losses that are difficult to quantify). The rectification project was basically successful, and the main current has been directed to the middle of the river, but the plan to use raft ships to wash sand involved mobilizing tugboats from Shanghai without using them, resulting in empty trips back and forth. The artificial dredging of Baishazhou involved building worker sheds and equipment at the construction site, originally planned for 4,000 people for 70 days, but in reality, only over 1,000 people were recruited, and after about a month of work, only one-eighth of the originally planned project quantity was completed before work was stopped. In addition, seven more "spherical joints" for dredging and discharging mud were made and left unused, partially freezing funds and causing partial losses. (2) Tanggu New Port Project: Due to the long-term unresolved construction policy, the budget could not be decided in time, and the project became unplanned, resulting in huge waste. The tangible losses alone totaled 189,560 jin of millet. (3) Jing-Tang Highway Project: Six losses have been identified: In the earthwork project, due to the inexperience of the supervisors, the roadbed was not compacted during filling, resulting in a high outer and low inner surface after driving, which could not drain water, requiring re-arching, wasting 9,000 jin of millet; in addition, a small number of newly made Portland cement slabs cracked, reducing the life of the project; the delay of the project, repairing the road surface during the rainy season, with repairs being washed away by rain, and the transportation of sand and gravel in windy seasons, all resulted in great waste, with a single construction site losing sand equivalent to 8,100 jin of rice in a single wind event. (4) Inspection of the East China Shipbuilding Project: The Shanghai Maritime Bureau, upon the decision of higher authorities, built tugboats and wooden barges of various types for transportation needs, with an estimated construction cost of 189,666,6892 jin of millet. Due to major errors in the planning, design, and construction methods, the manufactured ships faced difficulties in distribution and use, the manufacturing and operating costs were too high, and they could not fully undertake Yangtze River transportation. The barges and tugboats could not coordinate, causing serious losses to state property. In addition to these engineering losses, the waste of other materials was also very serious. (5) Central China Salvage Project: Due to improper procurement of sand flushers and dispatch of personnel, embezzlement and inability to use resulted in a waste of over 100 million yuan (this matter falls under the scope of embezzlement). (6) Shijiazhuang Transportation Factory: Due to the factory leadership's errors, mass production was started without trial production of the products, and the finished products were not well inspected, resulting in inferior products. The manufactured pistons, piston rings, and piston whistles could not be used. The fifth batch of suspension hooks for overhead wires was continuously heated, causing all of them to melt and the furnace to collapse, resulting in a total loss of 39,553,800 yuan. (7) Inspection of Grain Transportation on the Yangtze River: Although the task was basically completed, the initial planning and coordination were not perfect. During the flood season in the Yichang and Chongqing sections, wooden boats had seven accidents, resulting in four deaths and a loss of 1.36 million jin of grain; transportation was suddenly ordered to stop, and ships were transferred empty; also, grain could not be concentrated on time, resulting in ship downtime losses, etc.; the above three items resulted in a total loss of approximately 9.28 million jin of millet. (8) Northern Ocean Transportation: High port fees and cumbersome procedures affected shipping schedules and increased the burden on ships. For example, Tianjin Port charged as many as 35 types of fees, and ships entering port had to fill out 38 copies of warehouse receipts, overlapping inspections wasted time; and the loading and unloading fees were too high, such as the cost of loading and unloading each ton of goods at Tianjin Port being 10 jin of millet, equivalent to five times the cost of railway loading and unloading, resulting in waste.

In addition to inspecting the loss figures for the above eight projects, the causes of the waste and the lessons learned were also inspected, and suggestions for future improvement or handling were put forward.

The ninth item of the financial inspection was the budget and final accounts system. The inspection revealed that the largest portion of the Ministry of Transportation's construction investment was allocated before formal verification. For example, only 2% of the highway project budget was approved by the Finance Committee, mainly because the budget estimates were repeatedly changed, some as many as seven times. Furthermore, the budget was not accurate. For example, the Jing-Tang Highway project was basically completed, with a remaining project cost of 350,000 jin of millet (detailed material accounts not yet settled). The budgeted price of Portland cement was 800 jin of millet per ton, while the actual price of the materials used was only 300 jin. There were also some instances of misappropriation of funds and non-compliance with the budget system.

In the area of Materials

In terms of materials, inspections were conducted on office supplies, furniture and equipment, housing construction, vehicles, meeting receptions, etc. The main waste was found to be in housing construction and furniture procurement, mostly due to: (1) Lack of thorough planning and experience; (2) Lack of strict inspection and careless acceptance; (3) Greed for small savings, buying inferior goods, and lowering engineering standards, resulting in large losses. For example, of the 580 newly purchased desks, 125 had cracks, uneven surfaces, or broken locks; the dining hall and garage leaked as soon as they were completed after it rained; furniture was not properly maintained; the original paper for printing was often changed, wasting paper. Regarding receptions, the National Transportation Conference was planned to be completed in one month, but it lasted 47 days, exceeding the budget by more than 77,000 jin of millet. A survey of the market prices of 20 types of stationery proved that there was no waste in office supplies.

In the area of Organization

In terms of personnel staffing: The working relationships between departments and departments, divisions and divisions, and departments/divisions and the Maritime and Highway General Bureaus were unclear. The scope of work, tasks, division of labor, responsibilities, and duties of each unit were not clear enough. Therefore, in work, it often led to mutual restraint and duplication of waste. For example, the planning offices of the Maritime and Highway General Bureaus and the statistics office of the Planning Department of the Ministry all performed comprehensive statistical work, and the staffing was overlapping. For example, the transportation planning office of the Planning Department and the planning office of the two general bureaus were directly under the finance office and the accounting office of the two general bureaus, the organization was overlapping. Also, the division of labor between the personnel department of the ministry and the personnel departments of the two general bureaus was unclear, forming that the personnel department of the Maritime General Bureau had nothing to do. On the issues of leadership and work efficiency, it was found that there were too many meetings for leading cadres. Some division chiefs attended five meetings a day, and some attended fifteen meetings a week. Therefore, some responsible comrades were too busy attending meetings and coping with daily work, with less consideration and research on issues, and insufficient leadership, thus producing bureaucratic work styles. For example, the automobile management section of the Highway General Bureau, only a few people were busy, and ten people below had no work. In the work of receiving and dispatching documents, it was found that some letters were backlogged for a month without being processed.

Suggestions for Improvement

Based on the inspection of staffing and work issues, the following suggestions for improvement were proposed: (1) Under the leadership of the Minister and Deputy Ministers, the tasks and responsibilities of the one office, four departments, and two general bureaus should be clearly defined to form a unified and powerful organization; (2) The finances of the two general bureaus should be appropriately unified and concentrated under the management of the ministry, so that finance can be more highly centralized, and save manpower and reduce overlap; (3) The policies and tasks of the ministry and the two general bureaus must be clarified, and detailed office rules should be established to clarify the relationship, scope of work, and tasks between the various bureaus, divisions, and departments. (4) In technical work and administrative leadership, cadres should be urged to study harder so that they can take both into account; (5) Conscientiously implement the principle of fixed staffing and quotas, and appropriately adjust personnel whose work allocation is improper as much as possible; (6) Formulate business systems and regulations that can be formulated. At the same time, personnel who worked actively and cared for state resources were commended during the inspection.

The frugality and savings inspection of the Ministry of Transportation, because the leaders took responsibility and took the initiative, giving play to the enthusiasm of all personnel, and based on the many problems found during the inspection, put forward suggestions for improving work, achieving the purpose of educating cadres, improving work, and saving state financial expenditures.

　　中央人民政府交通部总结精简节约检查
    【本报讯】中央人民政府交通部的精简节约检查，于七月中旬开始进行，由部长和办公厅正副主任及各局、处负责人员组成精简节约检查组，作出进行检查的详细计划，在全体人员中进行精简节约文件的学习，发扬民主，展开批评与自我批评，发现很多问题。各小组所提意见达百余条。经财务（负责事业费的检查）、物资（负责房屋、家具、办公用费等的检查）、人事（负责编制及工作态度的检查）三个检查小组的研究检查，作成报告，然后由领导方面作出总结。这个总结已经政务院精简节约检查组会议通过。兹特发表如下：
    在财务方面
    在财务方面的检查，主要是总结了几项交通工程方面的各种浪费问题。检查内容计有九项：（一）浦口码头抢修工程的检查：此项工程基本上完成了任务，并有显著的成绩；但由于准备及经验的不足，计划、设计、采购材料，以及组织上、管理上欠周到甚至有错误，造成重大浪费。该项工程分两个主要部分，一是“整流”，一是“护岸”。（整流工程的内容是挖泥治理河床，疏导主流。）在护岸工程方面，“沉排”工程，因排床设计不妥，器材供应不及时，拖拉器材不合规则，拖不动，延误了时间，致使枯水期已过，水深流急不易按置而遭失败。购买梢料、苇料有的被包商坏账（虽在追缴，但成果甚少），有的远道购买价格高昂，有的不合规格，又因购入洋灰凝结，退货，使所购黄沙无用。以上共计损失九亿四千三百二十多万元（尚有不易统计的损失不包括在内）。整流工程部分，基本上是成功的，主流已导向中流，但因计划用排船冲沙，由上海调动拖轮未加使用，空空来回。白沙洲人工挖泥，工地预搭工棚及设备，原计划按四千人七十天之用，而实际招到一千余人，动工约一月，只完成原计划工程数量的八分之一，即行停工，以及多做了七个吸泥、排泥所用之“球形接头”，搁置无用，使资金部分冻结，造成部分损失。（二）塘沽新港工程：由于修建方针久悬未决，以致预算亦不能及时决定，工程进行变成无计划的状况，形成巨大浪费。只就有形损失，共计小米十八万九千五百六十斤。（三）京塘公路工程，已检查出六项损失：土方工程因监工人员无经验，填补路基时未经压实，行车后形成外高内低，不能排水，重作路拱，浪费小米九千斤；另外少数新做洋灰版发生裂纹，降低工程寿命；因工程延期，在雨季修整路容，修好被雨冲坏，以及在多风季节运输砂石等都有很大浪费，只一个工地一次因风损失的砂，即合八千一百斤米。（四）华东造船工程的检查：上海航务局经上级决定，为了运输的需要，建造拖轮及木驳各式船只，建造费概算一亿八千九百六十六万六千八百九十二斤小米，由于计划设计本身与施工方法均有极大错误，造出船只在分配使用上颇感困难，制造成本及使用成本均过高，不能完全担任长江运输，本驳与拖轮不能配合，对国家财产造成严重的损失。除了这些工程上的损失外，其他工料上的浪费也很严重。（五）华中区打捞工程：因添置冲砂机派遣人员不当，被贪污及不能使用约浪费一亿余元（此事属贪污范围）。（六）石家庄交通工厂，由于该厂领导的错误，对生产品未经试制，即着手大量生产，成品又未经很好检验，使产品低劣，所制成之活塞与活塞环、活塞哨子均不能使用，第五次制造架电线用的挂线勾，因连续加热，全部熔化，火炉倾塌，共计损失三千九百五十五万三千八百元。（七）长江航运川粮运输的检查：虽基本上完成了任务，但由于事先计划及各方联系配合不够完善，在宜、渝段洪水期间，木船失事七次，死四人并损失粮食一百三十六万斤；因中间突然奉令停运，船舶上调，来回空驶；又因粮食不能按期集中，以及停船损失等；以上三项共计约损失小米九百二十八万多斤。（八）北洋运输：由于港口费用高，手续繁，影响船期，增加船舶负担。如天津港收费三十五种之多，船只进口仓单须填三十八份，重叠检查浪费时间；又加装卸费太高，如天津港装卸每吨货，工价小米十斤，相当铁路装卸工价五倍，造成浪费。
    对以上八项工程，除检查出了损失数字，并检查了浪费的原因及其经验教训外，并提出了今后改进或处理的意见。
    财务检查的第九项是预决算制度。检查出交通部的建设投资，未经正式核定先行拨款占最大部分。如公路工程预算经财委核准者，只占全部建设投资的百分之二，主要原因系概算一再变更，有的竟达七次之多。再就是预算不精确。如京塘公路工程已基本完成，尚余工程费三十五万斤米（详细料账未清结），所用洋灰预算每吨价八百斤米，实际领用材料的价目只到三百斤。挪用款项，不遵守预算制度的现象亦有一些事例。
    在物资方面
    在物资方面，对办公用品，家具设备，房舍修建，车辆，开会招待等都作了检查。首先检查出主要的浪费是在房屋修建和购置家具的问题上面，并且多是由于：（一）事前无周密计划，又缺乏经验；（二）没有严格的检查，验收马虎；（三）贪图小的节省，买劣货，降低工程标准，结果造成大的损失。如新购办公桌五八○张，其中裂缝的、桌面不平的、坏锁的共计一百二十五张；食堂、车库刚刚竣工，下雨即漏；家具保管不善；印刷原稿纸常常变更，浪费纸张。在招待方面，全国交通会议，计划一月开完，结果开了四十七天，超支七万七千多斤米。对办公用品一项，根据二十种文具市价的调查，证明没有浪费。
    在组织方面
    在人事编制方面：检查出司与司、处与处，司、处与航务公路两总局的工作关系不明确，各单位本身的工作范围、任务、分工、执掌、职责都不够明确。因此在工作上，往往造成彼此牵制，重复浪费的现象。如航务、公路两总局计划处，与部计划司的统计处，都作全面的统计工作，并且编制上重叠，如计划司运输计划处与两总局计划处，都直属财务处与两总局会计处，组织是重叠的，又如人事司与两总局人事处分工不明，形成航务总局人事处无事干。在领导和工作效率问题上，检查出领导干部会议过多，有的处长，一天曾参加五次会，有的一礼拜参加十五次会。因此一些负责同志多忙于参加会议，及应付日常工作，考虑与研究问题较少，领导不够深入，因此产生官僚主义作风。如公路总局的汽车管理科，只少数几个人忙，下面十个人无工作。收发工作上检查出有的信件积压一月没有处理。
    改进意见
    根据编制和工作问题的检查，提出了以下的改进意见：（一）在正副部长领导下，一厅、四司、两总局的任务、职掌要划清，使成为统一有力的编制；（二）两总局财务，适当的统一集中于部管理，使财务能更高度的集中，并且节省人力，减少重叠；（三）部与两总局的方针任务必须明确，并定出办公细则，以明确各局、司、处的相互关系，工作范围及任务。（四）在技术工作和行政领导上，应使干部加紧学习，达到能够兼顾；（五）切实执行定员定额的原则，对工作分配不当的人员，尽可能适当调整；（六）制定有可能制定的业务制度规章。同时检查中对积极工作，和爱护国家资材的人员进行了表扬。
    交通部的精简节约检查，因为首长负责，亲自动手，发挥了全体人员的积极性，根据检查所发现的很多问题，提出了改进工作的意见，达到了教育干部，改进工作，节省国家财政开支的目的。
