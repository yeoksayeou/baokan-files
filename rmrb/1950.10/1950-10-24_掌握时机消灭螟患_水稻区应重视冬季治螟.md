Seize the Opportunity to Eliminate Rice Stem Borer Infestation
Rice-Growing Areas Should Emphasize Winter Borer Control

Rice stem borers are a serious pest of rice. Based on their shape and characteristics, they are distinguished into three types: the striped rice stem borer, the yellow rice borer, and the rice stalk borer. Among them, the rice stalk borer and the yellow rice borer also harm corn, sorghum, sugarcane, and other gramineous plants. Rice stem borer larvae bore into rice stalks from the outside, damaging them; they move from one rice stalk to another until they pupate into moths. The adult moths lay eggs on rice leaves, which hatch into larvae that continue to cause damage. Finally, during the rice harvest season, the larvae overwinter in rice stubble or stalks, and in the following year, they pupate, transform into moths, lay eggs, and continue to propagate and cause damage.

Controlling rice stem borers is a mass movement that must rely on and organize the masses to achieve results. This year, Zhejiang, Fujian, southern Jiangsu, and other regions mobilized the masses to collect over ten million egg masses and capture over 390 million moths, which played a certain role in this year's rice harvest. Currently, the autumn production in the Jiangnan area is underway or about to end, and it will soon transition to a relatively leisurely winter. However, at the same time, the remaining stem borer larvae are lurking in the rice stubble left in the fields, in the rice stalks piled up in front of houses, and a few rice stalk borer larvae hide in the weeds along field ridges, waiting to harm the rice fields again next year. Faced with this situation, we must be vigilant and take action. In areas with severe stem borer infestation, we should consider the specific local conditions, mobilize the masses to carry out control work that is more effective than collecting eggs and catching moths during the rice growing season. We must strive for thorough control; if we only pay attention to "points" and fail to implement comprehensive control, the few remaining that escape the net can still continue to breed and gradually spread and cause harm next year. This should be given special attention. Below are some relatively effective control methods for reference and application in areas where stem borer infestations occurred this year.

I. Clearing Rice Stubble and Burning Nests: In some higher-lying rice fields, after the rice harvest, there are plans to sow winter crops such as broad beans and peas, but often without plowing and harrowing, the rice stubble is left in the field, and seeds are directly sown. This is tantamount to protecting the stem borers lurking in the rice stubble, shielding them from wind, frost, rain, and snow. Therefore, before sowing winter crops in this type of rice field, attention should be paid to plowing and harrowing, raking out all the rice stubble, gathering it together, and burning it. If plowing and harrowing is difficult due to a lack of animal power or fear of delaying the sowing season due to seasonal constraints, organization for labor exchange and mutual assistance can be arranged. For rice fields that are not large, shovels and hoes can also be used to dig out the rice stubble and burn it. It is absolutely not permissible to leave them in the field, especially in areas where stem borer infestations were severe this year; this should be given special attention.

II. Flooding or Deep Plowing of Winter Fallow Fields: Some rice fields are low-lying, and even with raised beds, they are not suitable for planting winter crops, or they are limited by other practical conditions and cannot be sown. These winter fallow fields should be dealt with appropriately depending on the situation, with proper flooding or deep plowing. For example, rice fields that are low-lying and easy to flood should be fully flooded in winter, with the water depth sufficient to constantly submerge the rice stubble and maintain this for seven or eight weeks. This will not only cause the stem borers lurking in the rice stubble to die of suffocation, but also kill other pests that overwinter in the field. Winter fallow rice fields that are not suitable for flooding must be deeply plowed, and the rice stubble exposed on the ground should be collected and burned. Stem borers in rice stubble turned into the soil can also die of suffocation.

III. Clearing Weeds from Field Ridges and Edges: In addition to overwintering in rice stubble, rice stalk borer or yellow rice borer larvae may also crawl onto field ridges or into weeds along the edges of fields. In areas with severe stem borer infestations, attention should be paid to clearing and burning these weeds. It would be even more effective if the field ridges could be sealed with a layer of sticky, wet soil after the weeds are cleared.

IV. Proper Handling of Remaining Rice Straw: After threshing, rice stalks are generally piled up and kept for daily fuel or feed; some overwintering yellow rice borer larvae are also lurking in these rice stalks. Therefore, attention must be paid to the proper handling of these rice straw intended for fuel or feed. The most effective method is to burn or feed off the rice straw completely before the Qingming Festival next spring. However, if it is not realistically possible to complete the processing in time, then when piling up the rice straw (in the Jiangnan area, it is customary to pile the threshed rice straw bundles into conical stacks), attention should be paid to arranging the root ends in the center of the stack, with the ear ends arranged on the outside of the stack, and then use early rice stalks to weave grass mats to tightly enclose the stack.

　　掌握时机消灭螟患
    水稻区应重视冬季治螟
    微波
    螟虫是水稻的严重害虫。根据它的形状和特性，区别为三化螟虫，二化螟虫，和大螟虫三种。其中大螟虫和二化螟虫并为害玉米、高粱、甘蔗和其他禾本科的植物。稻螟虫在幼虫时期由稻谷茎秆的外部咬孔钻入为害；由这一株稻秆破坏到那一株稻秆，直至化蛹变蛾；待成虫在稻叶上产卵变成幼虫后，再继续为害；最后，在稻谷收割季节，以幼虫形态潜伏在稻桩或稻秆内过冬，第二年再变蛹化蛾产卵，繁衍后代继续为害。
    防治稻螟虫是一个群众性的运动，必须依靠群众，组织群众，才能够做出成绩。今年浙江、福建、苏南等地发动群众采螟卵一千余万块，捕捉螟蛾三亿九千余万只，对今年水稻的丰收，起了一定的作用。目前，江南一带正进行或将结束秋季生产，很快就将转入比较清闲的冬季了。但与此同时，残余的螟虫的幼虫却潜伏在留存田中的稻桩里，和堆积在屋前稻草堆上的稻秆里，以及少数大螟幼虫躲在田埂田边的杂草丛中，等待着来年再在出水稻田里为害。面对这个情况，我们必须有所警惕，并行动起来。在螟害严重区域，斟酌当地具体情况，发动群众，对潜伏的螟虫进行比较水稻生长季节的采卵捕蛾收效更大的防治工作，在防治上务求彻底，如只注意“点”而不能全面防治，则少许残余漏网的，到明年化蛹变蛾，仍然可以继续繁殖后代逐渐蔓延为害，这是应该特别注意的。下面特介绍一些比较有效的防治方法，以供本年发生螟害地区的参考应用。
    一、清除稻桩烧毁巢穴：有些地势较高的水稻田，在稻谷收割后还准备播种冬季庄稼，如蚕豆豌豆之类，但往往不经耕耙，任使稻桩存留田中，就迳行点种。这无异是保护潜伏在稻桩里的螟虫，给它遮蔽风霜雨雪。所以这一类的稻田，在播种冬季庄稼之前，应该注意加以耕耙，把所有稻桩耙出集拢烧毁。假使由于畜力缺乏，或因季节关系怕耽误了播种时期，耕耙有困难的，可以组织起来换工互助。其稻田面积不大的，也可用铁锹和锄头将稻桩掘出烧毁。决不可任其留存田中，尤其是本年螟害严重地区，更要特别注意。
    二、冬闲田灌水或深耕：有些稻田因为地势低下，虽做高畦也不宜种植冬季庄稼的，或为其他实际条件所限，不能播种的冬闲田，应该分别情况，加以适当的灌水或深耕。譬如地势低，灌水方便的稻田，冬季应充分灌水，灌水深度应能经常淹没稻桩，并继续保持七八周的时间。这样不仅可使潜伏在稻桩中的螟虫因窒息而死亡，其他在田里过冬的害虫，亦可同时死灭。不便灌水的冬闲稻田，必须深耕，并把暴露在地面的稻桩检集烧毁，耕翻在土里的稻桩中的螟虫也可窒息死亡。
    三、清除田埂田边杂草：大螟虫或二化螟虫的幼虫，除了潜伏在稻桩内过冬外，还可能爬到田埂上或田边的杂草丛中。在螟害严重地区，应该注意把这些野草清除烧毁。如在杂草清除后能把田埂封涂上一层粘湿泥土，就更有效。
    四、适当处理余存稻草：脱粒后的稻谷茎秆，一般是堆积起来留作日常的燃料或饲料；在这些稻秆里也潜伏着部分的二化螟的越冬幼虫。因此对这些留做燃料或饲料的稻草，必须注意加以适当处理。最有效的办法，是要在明春清明前就把稻草烧完或喂光，但如事实上不可能及时处理完毕，那末，在堆积稻草时（江南一带，习惯把脱粒的稻草束，堆集成圆锥形的草堆），应注意把根端排列在草堆的中央，使有穗的一端排列在草堆的外边，再用早稻茎秆编成草席，把草堆四周密密围起。
