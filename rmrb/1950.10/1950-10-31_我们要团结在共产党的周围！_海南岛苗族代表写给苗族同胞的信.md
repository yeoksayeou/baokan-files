Dear Miao compatriots:

　　I am writing this letter to you with immense excitement to express my heartfelt longing for you.

　　This time, I was able to come to Beijing to participate in such a grand and great National Day celebration, and I personally saw our respected leaders whom we have longed to see for so long - Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Premier Zhou, and the heads of the Central People's Government. I was so happy that tears came to my eyes. Chairman Mao is particularly concerned about our ethnic minorities, taking care of our food, clothing, and housing, even more lovingly than our own parents! I deeply feel that I am very honored; and I also feel that this is the first time in the history of our ethnic minorities to have such an honor. We should deeply remember this and thank our leader - Chairman Mao.

　　Compatriots! In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries drove us into the deep mountains; they did not want us to survive. Our ethnic minorities lived in a state of bewilderment and terror. We were poorly fed, poorly clothed, and treated like beasts of burden; we had no one to turn to with our grievances, and we were discriminated against everywhere, tasting all the bitterness of life. We were in extreme pain!

　　Today, the Communist Party has come and liberated the working people of China; similarly, our ethnic minorities have also turned over. The Communist Party has freed our ethnic minorities from thousands of years of feudal rule, and it has brought human freedom and happiness. Our fraternal ethnic groups have truly returned to the embrace of our mother (Beijing)! Our various fraternal ethnic groups hug and kiss each other, like one big family. Today, our ethnic minorities across the country have truly recognized that it was the Kuomintang reactionaries who oppressed and slaughtered us, and wanted us to be beasts of burden.

　　Compatriots! A new China has been born! The various ethnic minorities across the country have also truly united together! Our lives have also improved. However, the war-mongers headed by American imperialism are attempting to provoke a third world war, and are openly invading our Taiwan and friendly country Korea, destroying our peaceful construction. Standing on the position of all mankind in the world, we absolutely do not allow American imperialism to behave so rampantly. We need peace, and we need permanent and real peace even more! We resolutely oppose wars of aggression. If American imperialism dares to launch a war, then our ethnic minorities will use all our strength to strike at it and must defeat it.

　　Dear compatriots! We must enthusiastically sign our names on the peace declaration. We will use practical actions to show our support for the solemn statement of our Central People's Government Foreign Minister Zhou. We must overcome feudal narrow-minded ideas: "We Miao people have always lived by farming, without fields or land, so we don't care about world affairs, we don't participate in the army or politics, we don't have the skills to write or fight" (Note) and other backward ideas. We must unite around the Communist Party. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we will step up efforts to produce, support the People's Liberation Army, liberate Taiwan, and aid the Korean people!

　　(Note) The main idea of this paragraph is: We Miao people have no fields or land, and we have no culture or military force, so it is not our place to care about world affairs, we have no part in joining the army or politics.

　　我们要团结在共产党的周围！
    海南岛苗族代表写给苗族同胞的信亲爱的苗族同胞们：
    我为了对你们表示出十二万分的怀念，因此，以无限兴奋的心情给你们写这封信。
    这次，我能来京参加这么隆重、伟大的国庆节，而又亲眼看见了我们渴望多久的敬爱的领袖——毛主席、朱总司令、周总理及中央人民政府各首长。我简直高兴得流下泪来了。毛主席对我们少数民族，特别关怀，食的，穿的，住的无不照顾，比亲生我们的父母还爱借呢！我深深体验到我非常的光荣；同样也体验到这是我们少数民族有历史以来的第一次光荣。我们该深深的记忆，并感谢我们的领袖——毛主席。
    同胞们！在过去，国民党反动派赶我们到深山里，他们不要我们生存。我们少数民族，是在彷徨、恐怖的环境里过日子的。我们食不饱，穿不温，当牛当马；我们有苦无处诉，到处受人歧视，尝尽了人生的苦楚，我们痛苦极了！
    今天，共产党来了，解放了中国的劳苦人民，同样，我们少数民族也翻了身。共产党，他给我们少数民族解除了几千年来封建的统治，他带来了人类自由与幸福。我们兄弟民族真正回到自己的母亲（北京）怀抱里啦！我们各兄弟民族，互相怀抱亲吻，像大家庭一样。我们全国各少数民族，今天真正认清了过去压迫、屠杀我们、要我们当牛当马的是国民党反动派。
    同胞们！新的中国是产生了！全国各少数民族，也已真正的团结在一起了！生活也改善了。但是以美帝国主义为首的战争贩子，正在妄图挑起第三次大战，并公开的侵略我们台湾和友邦朝鲜，破坏我们的和平建设。我们站在全世界人类的立场上，是绝对不容许美帝国主义这样猖狂的行为。我们需要和平，更需要永久真正的和平！我们坚决的反对侵略战争，如果，美帝国主义，但敢发动战争，那么，我们少数民族就要以全力来打击他，并一定要击败它。
    亲爱的同胞们！我们要热烈的在和平宣言上签下自己的名字。用实际行动来表示拥护我们中央人民政府周外长的严正声明。克服封建狭隘思想：“我苗人一贯是岱过活，无田无地，天下事不到?（咱）管，参军参政?（咱）不份，执文执武?（咱）不本”（注）等落后思想。我们要团结在共产党的周围。在毛主席英明的领导下，加紧努力生产，支援人民解放军，解放台湾，并援助朝鲜人民！
                来京参加国庆节的海南岛苗族代表  哲忠
                一九五○年十月二十日于北京
    （注）此段大意是：我苗人无田无地，又没有文化和武力，所以天下事轮不到我们管，参军参政也没有我们的份。
