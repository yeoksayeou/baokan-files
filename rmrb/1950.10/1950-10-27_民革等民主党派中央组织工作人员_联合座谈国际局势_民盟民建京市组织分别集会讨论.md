　　The development of the Korean War situation and the actions of U.S. imperialism in manipulating the United Nations General Assembly to expand the war of aggression against Korea have aroused close attention from various democratic parties. Staff members of the central and Beijing municipal organizations of the democratic parties have held successive current affairs symposiums to further analyze and understand the current international situation.

　　More than 60 staff members from the central organizations of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), China Democratic League, China National Democratic Construction Association, China Association for Promoting Democracy, Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and the Jiusan Society jointly held a current affairs symposium on the morning of the 18th. At the meeting, speakers unanimously agreed that the Korean people's struggle is a long and arduous process, and it will draw lessons from the experiences of the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation to achieve final victory. After specifically analyzing the intentions of U.S. imperialism in expanding the war of aggression against Korea, the participants emphasized that the Chinese people must be fully prepared to defend the motherland and world peace.

　　More than 40 people, including Li Xiangfu from the Beijing branch of the China Democratic League, gathered on the afternoon of the 18th to discuss "The New Situation in the Korean War." On the same afternoon, the Beijing Branch of the China National Democratic Construction Association and the Guangming Daily jointly invited more than 20 representatives from various industries in Beijing's industrial and commercial circles to discuss the Korean War situation, with Zhang Naiqi, Ling Qihan, and others giving key speeches. Both symposiums unanimously criticized the ideas of quick victory and pessimism regarding the Korean War; and came to the conclusion that the Korean people will inevitably achieve final victory through a long and arduous struggle. Participants at both meetings unanimously supported Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. People from industrial and commercial circles expressed their determination to work hard to develop production and prosper the economy to enrich the strength of the country.
