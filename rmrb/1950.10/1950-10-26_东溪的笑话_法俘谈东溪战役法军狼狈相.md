Xinhua News Agency, October 25th: The Vietnam News Agency reports that the "Voice of Vietnam" radio station's special correspondent's interview with Pierre Lot, the personal secretary of Captain Alliou, the former French commander of the Dongkhe sector, who was captured in the Battle of Dongkhe, fully exposes the corruption and embarrassing situation of the French army. Pierre Lot said: "At 6:20 AM on September 16th, when Lieutenant Achille Cilère and his men were patrolling towards Cao Bằng, a shell suddenly shook the entire city of Dongkhe, followed by many more shells. After two hours of artillery fire, Captain Alliou reported to his superiors: 'Dongkhe is under attack. One bunker has been destroyed, and forty people have been killed. We fired two hundred shells, but with no results.' Alliou then asked me to send a telegram requesting more shells. It wasn't until 2:00 PM that the planes airdropped forty-seven parachutes to us. But because of the heavy artillery fire outside, we couldn't retrieve the shells brought by the parachutes. The situation became even more serious after the forward outposts fell into the hands of the Vietnamese People's Army. By the evening of September 16th, the telephone lines between the 'large stronghold' and other parts of the city had been cut off. Our radio transmitter was also broken. After the transmitter was repaired, the antenna was cut off again. A sergeant in charge of the radio, who was sent out to repair the antenna, was killed by a shell. That night, the Vietnamese People's Army began to attack the city. The artillery and machine gun fire of the People's Army was very accurate. Our entire artillery team of 105mm cannons, as well as the artillery commander, were killed by artillery fire.

On the morning of the 17th, Captain Alliou asked me to send the following telegram: 'Dongkhe is under serious threat. All surrounding outposts were captured last night. Our troops have suffered heavy losses. Our 105mm cannons are out of action. Please airdrop paratroopers immediately.' After a while, we received a reply saying: 'Today is Sunday, and General Marcel is receiving guests and there is a dance party tonight. So please wait a moment.' Alliou was already very angry due to the lack of ammunition, and he became even more furious. He roared, 'General Marcel knows how to dance, and I know how to leave this damn stronghold!' It wasn't until 11:00 AM that we received another telegram saying, 'General Marcel highly praises Captain Alliou's heroic spirit.' Alliou was even more furious, shouting, 'I don't need your praise now! Where are the reinforcements? Reinforcements!' At this time, the cannons continued to bombard our defenders. On the night of the 17th, the People's Army, supported by artillery, attacked our positions again. Grenades were thrown in through the gun holes. The wounded soldiers near the headquarters were screaming loudly. And in the fortifications, our commanders were standing behind us with pistols, preventing us from escaping. As dawn approached, more of our soldiers were killed. Captain Valère came in and reported that more than a hundred people had been killed in the shelters. This startled Alliou. At this moment, loudspeakers outside were shouting: 'Lay down your weapons, French soldiers! We will treat you well!' We did not reply. The wounded soldiers continued to scream. Suddenly, Alliou fired a shot into the air and shouted, 'Fix bayonets!' Then he rushed out of the fortifications. We followed him to the courtyard and were captured. The others who remained in the shelters also surrendered after a while."

Pierre Lot sighed, "Looking back on the past few days of the war, I am deeply grateful that I only suffered minor injuries and received proper care. I only hope that the war ends quickly so that we can return home." When Pierre Lot spoke about the Vietnamese people's support for the army, he said: "The Vietnamese people are very happy to transport food and ammunition for the army. This is something we have never seen in the places we have been stationed. No one comes near our defense areas. In Dongkhe, there is not a single person within eight kilometers around."

　　东溪的笑话
    法俘谈东溪战役法军狼狈相
    【新华社二十五日讯】越南通讯社讯：“越南之声”电台特派记者报道在东溪战役中被俘的前法军东溪分区司令阿留上尉的私人秘书皮尔洛和该记者的谈话，充分暴露了法军的腐败和狼狈情况。皮尔洛说：九月十六日上午六点二十分，当阿希西莱尔中尉及其部下向高平方向巡逻的时候，突有一枚炮弹震撼了东溪全市，接着又来了许多炮弹。经过两小时炮战，阿留上尉遂向上级报告：“东溪被攻。一处碉堡被毁，有四十人被击毙。我们发了两百发炮弹，但没有什么结果。”阿留于是叫我打电报，请发更多的炮弹。直到午后二时，飞机才向我们空投了四十七个降落伞。但由于外面炮火正烈，我们无法把降落伞带来的炮弹取进来。当前哨据点已经落于越南人民军之手后，形势更为严重了。到九月十六日晚，“大据点”与市区其他各处的电话已被切断。我们的无线电发报机也坏了。在发报机修复以后，天线又被切断了。一个派出去修理天线的管理无线电的伍长被炮弹炸死。当夜，越南人民军开始进攻城区。人民军的炮火和机枪火力非常准确。我们一○五公厘大炮的整个炮兵队以及炮队司令都被炮火击毙。
    十七日晨，阿留上尉要我发出下面的电报：“东溪正受严重的威胁。所有周围的据点均已于昨夜被占领。我方部队遭受严重损失。我们一○五公厘口径的大炮已不能用。请立即空投伞兵。”过了一会儿，我们接到复电说：“今天是星期日，马尔厢将军正在接待客人，今晚还有舞会。所以请等一等。”阿留由于缺少军火本已很生气，这时就大发脾气。他大声咆哮说：“马尔厢将军知道怎样去跳舞，我也知道怎样离开这个鬼据点！”直到上午十一时，我们又接到另一个电报说，“马尔厢将军非常称赞阿留上尉的英雄精神。”阿留又大发雷霆，他吵着叫着说：“我现在可不要你称赞！援军，援军在那里呢？援军！”这时，大炮继续对我们的守军轰来。十七日夜，人民军在炮兵支持下又进攻我们的阵地。手榴弹从枪眼里丢进来。司令部附近的伤兵大声号叫着。而在工事里，我们的司令官们都正站在我们背后，用手枪对着我们，我们想逃走也没法子。将近拂晓，我们士兵被击毙的更多了。伐莱尔上尉进来报告说：掩体内已有一百多人被击毙。这使阿留发了一怔。这时，外面扩音器正在大叫：“放下你们的武器罢，法国士兵们！我们会优待你们的！”我们没有答复。伤兵们又呼号起来。突然，阿留向空放了一枪，叫喊一声：“大家上刺刀！”接着就冲出工事。我们也跟着跑到院里，于是被俘。其余留在掩体内的人，过了一会儿也都投降了。
    皮尔洛感叹地说：“回想过去几天的战争，我深幸我仅受微伤，又蒙适当的照顾，我只希望战争赶快结束，我们好回国去。”皮尔洛讲到越南人民支援军队的情形时说：越南人民非常快乐地替军队运粮食和军火，这在我们所驻扎过的地方，从来没有看到过。谁也不到我们的防地附近来。在东溪，甚至周围八公里以内都不见一人。
