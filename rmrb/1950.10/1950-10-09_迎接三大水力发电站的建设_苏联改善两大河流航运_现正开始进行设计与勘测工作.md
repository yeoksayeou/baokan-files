　　Welcoming the Construction of Three Major Hydroelectric Power Stations
    The Soviet Union Improves Navigation on Two Major Rivers
    Design and Survey Work is Now Underway
    [Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Moscow, 28th] The construction of the three major hydroelectric power stations at Kuibyshev, Stalingrad, and Kakhovka will drastically change the navigation conditions on the Volga and Dnieper rivers. New ports and docks must be built and old ones renovated on the Volga River. A research institute specializing in the design and surveying of inland water transport is currently carrying out large-scale design and surveying work related to various projects on the Volga River. The construction plans for ports, docks, and shipyards in the Kuibyshev Reservoir area are already prepared. The water level here will rise, causing the currently used ports and docks to be submerged. New large ports will be built in Stavropol, Ulyanovsk, Kazan, Zelenodolsk, and Melekess. The city of Melekess is located on both banks of the shallow Cheremshan River, which flows into the Volga River. After the completion of the Kuibyshev hydraulic system, the Cheremshan River will become a deep-water river, and even Volga River ships can freely navigate on it. In addition to large-scale ports, the Kuibyshev Reservoir will also have about forty docks.
    In the area of the future Stalingrad Reservoir, the research institute currently has five survey teams working there. Topographers, geologists, and hydrologists are conducting water depth measurements, terrain surveys, and aerial surveys. For the first time, the survey teams are using the "Echolot" device invented by the Institute for Automatic and Rapid Depth Measurement under river water conditions. The Stalingrad Reservoir will have four major ports built in Stalingrad, Volsk, Kamyshin, and Saratov, as well as dozens of docks.
    Surveying and design work has also begun at the site of the Kakhovka Reservoir on the Dnieper River. After the completion of the reservoir project, the water level in the lower reaches of the Dnieper River will be greatly raised. New-style ships with large cargo capacities will be able to navigate freely on the entire river. Designs are currently being made for lighthouses that are 60 meters high, and their light will be visible from 25 to 30 kilometers away.

　　迎接三大水力发电站的建设
    苏联改善两大河流航运
    现正开始进行设计与勘测工作
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十八日电：古比雪夫、斯大林格勒和卡霍夫卡三大水力发电站的建设，将使伏尔加河与第聂伯河航运状况发生急剧的变化。伏尔加河上必须建造新的并且改造旧的港埠与码头。一个专门从事设计与勘测内河运输的研究所刻正进行大规模的与伏尔加河上各项工程有关的设计与勘测工作。古比雪夫蓄水池的港埠、码头和船坞的建筑计划已经准备就绪。这儿的水面将要升高，以致目前使用的港埠与码头均将没入水中。在斯塔夫罗波尔、乌里雅诺夫斯克、喀山、塞连诺多尔斯克和密列凯斯等处均将建筑新的大港埠。密列凯斯城位于流入伏尔加河的契伦姆山浅水河的两岸。古比雪夫水利系统筑成以后，契伦姆山河就要变成深水河，连伏尔加河的轮船都可以在上面自由来往。古比雪夫蓄水池除了大规模的港埠之外，还要建筑大约四十个码头。
    在将来的斯大林格勒蓄水池地区，该研究所现有五个勘测队在那里工作。地形学家、地质学家、水利学家们正在进行测量水深、勘测地形和空中测验的工作。勘测队第一次在河水的条件下使用自动与快速深度测量研究所所发明的“埃霍路特”装置。斯大林格勒蓄水池将分别在斯大林格勒、伏尔斯克、卡密辛和萨拉多夫建筑四个大港埠以及数十个码头。
    第聂伯河上建筑卡霍夫卡蓄水池的地方亦已开始勘测与设计工作。在蓄水池的工程竣工以后，第聂伯河下游的水位将要大大升高。载货量巨大的新式轮船将在全河自由行驶。现正设计灯塔的图样，这些灯塔高达六十公尺，二十五至三十公里以外即可见到它们的光芒。
