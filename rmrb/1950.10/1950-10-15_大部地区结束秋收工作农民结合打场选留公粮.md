[Shenyang News] *Northeast Daily* reports: After frost fell in most parts of North and South Manchuria in the middle of last month, with the vigorous leadership and urging of a large number of cadres from governments at all levels who went deep into the fields to guide the farmers to speed up harvesting, as of October 10th, the region’s 9,349,857 *hectares* of sorghum, millet, corn, and more than 1,600,000 *hectares* of miscellaneous grains have been basically harvested. In South Manchuria, most of the corn has been put into storage. About half of the millet, sorghum, and other crops have been brought to the threshing grounds and are now fully engaged in transporting the crops and threshing, combined with selecting good grain in preparation for submitting the public levy. Of the more than 2,800,000 *hectares* of soybeans planted in the region, harvesting is underway as they ripen. In Hailin County, Songjiang Province, where the season is later, half of the more than 53,000 *hectares* of farmland have been transported, and one-third have been threshed. New soybeans from many villages have already entered the market. In Suizhong District 6, Liaoxi Province, where the season is earlier, under the specific leadership of provincial and county cadres, all crops have been put into storage. Many farmers are selecting good grain during threshing in preparation for the public levy. This year, encouraged by the bumper harvest, farmers prepared autumn harvesting tools early and adequately. Most of the labor force and livestock participated in mutual aid teams. Men, women, old and young, worked together, harvesting as soon as the crops ripened. If the leadership continues to deepen and guide the transport and threshing processes, most areas of the region can complete threshing and storage by the end of the month, shortening the autumn harvest period by ten days to half a month compared to previous years.

Encouraged by the bumper harvest and propelled by the leading roles of rural party members, cadres, and labor models, many farmers have already begun to combine transporting and threshing with selecting good grain in preparation for the public levy. For example, on October 3rd, Renhe Village, Xinzhan District, Jiaohe County, held a People's Representative Meeting and decided to select high-quality grain during threshing in preparation for submitting the public levy. Based on last year's public levy burden (80,000 *jin* of corn), the village has already selected 100,000 *jin* while shucking the corn, all of which are large cobs with full kernels. When the hired laborer Wang Rong was shucking corn, he saw that the newly opened two *mu* of corn was large and solid, and selected 460 *jin* to be used for the public levy. When the old woman Wang, who is over fifty years old, from Shengli Village, was threshing soybeans, she set aside two bags of the best-quality soybeans to be used for the public levy.

　　大部地区结束秋收工作农民结合打场选留公粮
    【沈阳讯】东北日报消息：上月中旬南北满大部地区降霜后，在各级政府组织大批干部深入领导督促农民加紧收割下，至本月十日，全区九百三十四万九千八百五十七垧高粱、谷子、苞米及一百六十多万垧杂粮已基本割完，南满苞米大部入仓，谷子、高粱等作物约有半数以上拉进了场，正全力转入拉庄稼、打场结合选好粮准备送公粮。全区所种的二百八十多万垧大豆，正随熟随收中。季节较晚的松江海林县五万三千多垧大田已拉完一半，打完三分之一，很多村的新黄豆已上市。季节较早的辽西绥中六区在省县干部的具体领导下，庄稼已全部入仓，不少农民在打场中选了好粮准备妥公粮。今年因为丰收，鼓舞农民及早充分的准备了秋收用具，大部劳动力和畜力参加互助组，男女老少齐动手，熟一块割一块，如继续深入领导拉打，全区大部地区月底可结束打场入仓，使秋收期较往年缩短十天到半月。
    在丰收的鼓舞和农村党员、干部、劳动模范的带头推动下，不少农民已在开始结合拉庄稼打场中选好粮准备公粮。如蛟河新站区仁和村于十月三日开了人民代表会，决定打场时选出上等粮准备送公粮。根据去年公粮负担情况（八万斤苞米），该村在扒苞米时已选了十万斤，都是棒大籽粒饱满的苞米。雇农王荣扒苞米时，看新开的二亩地的苞米又大又实成，选出四百六十斤做公粮。胜利屯五十多岁的王老大娘打大豆时留出两麻袋上风头的准备交公粮。
