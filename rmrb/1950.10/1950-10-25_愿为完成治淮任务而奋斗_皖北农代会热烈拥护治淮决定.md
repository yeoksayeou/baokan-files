　　Willing to Strive to Complete the Huai River Harnessing Task
    Anhui Northern Agricultural Representatives' Conference Warmly Endorses Huai River Harnessing Decision
    [This newspaper's report] According to the Anhui Northern Daily: The Central People's Government's decision on harnessing the Huai River has been warmly endorsed by the representatives attending the Anhui Northern Farmers' Representatives Conference in Hefei. They have expressed that this is a major measure concerning the tens of millions of people along the Huai River, and they are willing to strive to complete this great task of harnessing the Huai River. Jin Zhengxiang, a representative from Huoqiu, excitedly told the reporter: "This decision of the Central People's Government is exactly what we want! Who wouldn't be happy to hear it! " A representative in Mengcheng, over sixty years old, was very happy to hear about harnessing the Huai River. He said: "Our village is flooded every year, and the suffering is endless. Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government are determined to fix the Huai River, so our production will be guaranteed in the future."
    Many representatives expressed their infinite gratitude to Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government for their concern for the people's interests and their determination to eradicate the Huai River's problems. When mentioning the corrupt rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, their failure to develop water conservancy, and especially the blasting of the Yellow River embankment at Huayuankou in 1938, which caused the Huai River floods, they all expressed their deep hatred. Zhao Ruyi, a representative from Shouxian, said: "We have suffered from floods every year because of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. If it weren't for the Chiang Kai-shek's breaching of the Yellow River, how could we have suffered so much! At that time, the Chiang Kai-shek government considered drafting men and demanding donations as important, and when the water came and the dikes broke, they didn't care at all. Only our Chairman Mao and the People's Government are our great benefactors."
    The representatives expressed their firm belief and determination to harness the Huai River well. Ye Wanshu, a representative from Yingshang, said: "If the water is not controlled, it is us who will be flooded. Who wouldn't want to control the water! Our village has organized a labor team of fifty-five people, and everyone is eager to get on the dike as soon as possible." He especially praised the point in the Huai River harnessing decision that "guarantees the wheat harvest next year." He said, "We farmers only look forward to the wheat harvest, Chairman Mao is so considerate of us! He is really our great savior." Zhu Xingguo, a representative from the Nanzhao district of Yingshang, said: "Chairman Mao is determined to harness the Huai River well, and we must also be determined. This summer, the floodwater was only four or five inches from the top of our township's embankment. The district chief led us in the rescue, and as a result, the embankment did not break. This year, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will definitely be able to harness the Huai River."

　　愿为完成治淮任务而奋斗
    皖北农代会热烈拥护治淮决定
    【本报讯】据皖北日报讯：中央人民政府政务院关于治理淮河的决定，受到正在合肥开会的皖北农民代表大会的代表们热烈拥护，纷纷表示这是关系沿淮数千万人民的重大措施，并愿为完成这伟大的治淮任务而奋斗。霍邱代表金正祥兴奋的对记者说：“中央人民政府这个决定，正中了俺们的心意，谁个听了不心胜（欢喜）！蒙城一个六十多岁的代表，听到要治理淮河时非常高兴，他说：“俺村年年受淹，苦处说也说不尽。毛主席和中央人民政府决心修好淮河，以后俺们的生产可有保障了。”
    许多代表对于毛主席和中央人民政府关心人民利益，决心根治淮河，均表示无限感激。而提到蒋匪腐败统治，不兴水利，尤其在一九三八年在花园口炸开黄堤造成淮河水灾，无不切齿痛恨。寿县代表赵如意说：“俺们年年遭水灾都是蒋匪害的，要不是蒋匪扒黄河，俺们咋会受这种苦！那会子蒋匪政府拉壮丁、要捐费是重要的，水来堤破，他管也不管，只有俺们毛主席、人民政府才是大恩人。”
    代表们对治好淮河都表示了坚强的信念和决心。颍上代表叶万书说：“水要治不好，淹的是俺自己，谁个不想把水治好！俺村已组织好民工分队，一共五十五个人，大家都巴着早点上堤。”他特别称赞治淮决定中“保障明年麦收”一点，他说“俺种地的就一个劲望麦收，毛主席多体谅俺！真是俺们的大救星。”颍上南照区代表朱兴国说：“毛主席下决心治好淮河，我们也一定有决心。今夏大水离俺乡坝顶只四五寸，区长领导我们抢险，结果堤没有破，今年毛主席领导我们干，淮河一定可以治好”。
