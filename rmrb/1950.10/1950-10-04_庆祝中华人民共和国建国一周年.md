　　Celebrating the First Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China
　　Wu Chunrong, Representative of the Vietnamese Delegation to the World Federation of Democratic Youth
　　As the grand and glorious first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China approaches, we, the Vietnamese youth, share the same excitement and enthusiasm as the Chinese youth in welcoming this great and epoch-making festival.

　　The first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China will also be a day to summarize the achievements made in economic construction over the past year. After visiting many places, we have seen the achievements of liberated China, and we have also seen China's enormous potential strength in the cause of peace. China's victory is a great historical event in the world revolution since the October Revolution. Today, as American imperialism attempts to plunder the fruits of the people's revolution and launch a new war, October 1st has particularly important significance, marking a new and glorious step for the people of the world towards peace.

　　The Vietnamese youth representatives feel infinitely happy and honored to participate in the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation meeting in New China this time. In the Northeast and in various places in Beijing and Tianjin, the Vietnamese youth representatives have keenly felt the newborn and invincible strength of the heroic Chinese youth brothers and sisters, which has greatly encouraged us and made us more eager to humbly learn from the Chinese youth brothers and sisters under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of the Eastern Revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong. In particular, the young combat heroes of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the young labor heroes of various factories and farms, and the various model young technicians have aroused our infinite admiration and love.

　　Today, the Chinese youth are participating in various constructions of the New Democracy with practical actions, with abundant energy and sincere patriotic enthusiasm. This unparalleled love for labor, love for the motherland, love for the nation, and the noble ideological actions of loving peace and loving mankind have greatly inspired us Vietnamese youth.

　　When the war group headed by American imperialism sets up military bases everywhere, frantically prepares for war, and openly carries out direct aggression, the brilliant victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War has not only strengthened the defense force of the world's peace and democracy camp, but also dealt a fatal blow to the invaders, thereby encouraging the independence struggle of weak nations around the world, especially the liberation movement in Southeast Asian colonies and semi-colonies.

　　Commemorating the National Day of the People's Republic of China has special and cordial significance for the Vietnamese people. In the past era of the Anti-Japanese War, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people and the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, fought side by side against the world's fascist bandits, jointly eliminating Japanese imperialism. When the good news of the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War continued to spread to Vietnam, especially when the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries were driven to the Vietnamese border by the heroic and invincible Chinese People's Liberation Army, it greatly inspired and consolidated the Vietnamese people's determination to win the liberation war. Under this great encouragement, Vietnamese youths volunteered to kill the enemy, soldiers bravely charged into battle on the battlefield, workers in factories intensified production to support the front, and the vast number of farmers expressed their determination to defend their homeland with patriotic production competitions.

　　Vietnamese youth and Chinese youth are always close comrades-in-arms on the anti-imperialist front. Today, the Chinese people have defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialists, and the Vietnamese people are also closely united under the banner of Chairman Ho Chi Minh to smash the puppet regime of Bảo Đại, the remaining forces of French imperialism in Vietnam, and the American imperialist interference in the Vietnamese national liberation war. Therefore, we believe that the great and glorious victory of the Chinese people today is also the victory of the Vietnamese people. Today, the Vietnamese people are also holding grand celebrations in their own country to congratulate our dear friendly country—the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

　　The direction of struggle of Chinese youth and Vietnamese youth is consistent, and the strength is inseparable. The Chinese youth's infinitely rich and valuable experience in the long-term battle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and in the great work of nation-building over the past year, is sufficient for us Vietnamese youth to learn from.

　　Today, on the occasion of the grand celebration of the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we, on behalf of all Vietnamese youth, would like to celebrate with sincere and enthusiastic enthusiasm the early success of the New Democratic China's construction under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong!

　　Finally, let us cheer:

　　Democratic youths of the world, unite and fight to defend lasting world peace and a better future!

　　Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

　　Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!

　　Long live the People's Republic of China!

　　Long live the unity between the Chinese and Vietnamese people!

　　庆祝中华人民共和国建国一周年
    世界民主青联代表团越南代表  武春荣
    面对着伟大光辉的中华人民共和国建国一周年纪念，我们越南青年也和中国青年一样地以兴奋热烈的心情来迎接着这个伟大胜利的，具有划时代意义的节日。
    中华人民共和国宣告成立的一周年纪念日也将是总结一年来在经济建设上所得的成就的一天。在我们访问了很多地方以后，我们看到了解放了的中国所得到的成就，我们也看到了中国在为和平事业建设中的巨大的潜在的力量。中国的胜利在世界革命中是十月革命以来一个具有伟大历史意义的事件。正当美帝企图掠夺人民的革命果实而发动新战争的今天，十月一日是有着特别重大的意义的，它标志着全世界人民走向和平的新的光辉的一步。
    越南青年代表这次参加世界民主青年联盟代表团在新中国会师，我们感到无限的愉快和荣耀。在东北，在京津各地，越南青年代表亲切体会到英勇的中国青年兄弟姐妹们那股新生的不可战胜的力量，大大鼓舞了我们，使我们更要虚心地向在中国共产党和伟大的东方革命领袖毛泽东同志领导下的中国青年兄弟姐妹们学习。特别是中国人民解放军的青年战斗英雄，各工厂农庄的青年劳动英雄，以及各种模范的年青的技工人员，引起我们无限的敬佩和爱戴。
    今天，中国青年正以实际的行动，用充沛的精力和真挚的爱国主义的热诚来参加新民主主义的各种建设，这种无比的爱劳动，爱祖国，爱民族以及爱和平爱人类的崇高的思想行动大大地激励了我们越南青年。
    当以美帝为首的战争集团到处遍设军事基地，疯狂准备战争，而且公开进行直接侵略的时候，中国人民解放战争辉煌的胜利，不仅增强了世界和平民主阵营的保卫力量，而且还给侵略者以致命的痛击，从而鼓励了全世界弱小民族的独立斗争，特别是东南亚殖民地半殖民地的解放运动。
    纪念中华人民共和国的国庆，对越南人民来说，是有特别亲切的意义。在过去抗日战争时代，中国人民在毛泽东主席的领导下，越南人民在胡志明主席的领导下，同为反抗世界法西斯主义强盗而并肩作战，共同来消灭日本帝国主义。当中国的人民解放战争胜利的捷报不断传到越南时候，尤其是当国民党反动派的残兵败卒被英勇无敌的中国人民解放军驱逐到越南边境的时候，大大地激励和巩固了越南人民争取解放战争胜利的决心。越南人民在这种伟大的鼓舞下，越南青年们纷纷请缨杀敌，战士们在战场上勇猛地冲锋肉搏，工厂中的工人兄弟们即加紧生产支援前线，广大的农民们用爱国生产竞赛来表示他们对保乡卫国的决心。
    越南青年和中国青年在反帝的战线上永远是亲密的战友，今天中国人民已战胜了国民党反动派和美帝国主义者，而越南人民也正紧紧地团结在胡志明主席的旗帜下来纷碎保大傀儡政权、法帝国主义者在越南的残余力量以及美帝国主义对越南民族解放战争的干涉。因此我们认为中国人民今天伟大光辉的胜利，也就是越南人民的胜利。今天越南人民也正在自己的国土上举行盛大的庆祝会来祝贺我们亲爱的友邦——中华人民共和国建国一周年纪念。
    中国青年和越南青年斗争的方向是一致的，力量是分不开的。中国青年在长期的反帝反封建反官僚资本主义的战斗中，在一年来的建国伟业工作中，无限丰富与宝贵的经验都足供我们越南青年来好好学习的。
    今天欣逢中华人民共和国建国一周年的盛典，我们代表越南全体青年谨以诚恳真挚的热情来庆祝在中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下的新民主主义的中国建设早日成功！
    最后，让我们欢呼：
    全世界的民主青年们团结起来，为保卫世界持久和平和美好将来而斗争！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中越人民团结万岁！
