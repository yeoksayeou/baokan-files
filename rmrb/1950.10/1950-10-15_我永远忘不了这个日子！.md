　　I Will Never Forget This Day!
    A Worker from the Pingyuan Province Agricultural Department Promotion Team
    I was born into a peasant family, and my family was very poor when I was young. There were four people in my family: my mother, sister, brother, and myself. We only had a little over three mu of land and owed debts to others. We had nothing to eat at home, so we had to beg for food. I started begging at the age of seven and continued until I was thirteen. Because I was hungry, I picked up a few ears of grain from the landlord's field and was beaten black and blue by them. At that time, I often thought: poverty has no root, wealth has no seedlings, and the poor will one day raise their heads.
    In 1944, the Eighth Route Army came to the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, leading the people to resist Japan and also implemented rent and interest reduction... Later, land reform was carried out. Since then, the peasants have been liberated. At the same time, I joined the workforce. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, I studied culture and theory and improved my awareness. I thought, we can be liberated, not oppressed, and not hungry, all thanks to Chairman Mao's good leadership. I often heard others say that Chairman Mao talked to soldiers, workers, and peasants. I was very envious and often wondered when I would be able to see Chairman Mao!
    In early September of this year, I was transferred to the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government in Beijing to study new agricultural tools, and I had the opportunity to participate in the National Day parade in Beijing. Before the parade on October 1st, I wondered if I would be able to see Chairman Mao today. As our team approached Tiananmen Square, I paid attention to seeing if Chairman Mao was there. In the countless crowds, red flags fluttered everywhere, and the waist drum team members were jumping, but I didn't feel like watching, just wanting to see Chairman Mao. When we arrived in front of Tiananmen, everyone enthusiastically shouted slogans of "Long live Chairman Mao!" At this time, I grabbed my comrades' arms, stood on tiptoes, and looked straight at Tiananmen Square. Finally, I saw Chairman Mao standing in the center of Tiananmen Tower, waving to the parade and shouting, "Long live the comrades!" As soon as I saw Chairman Mao, I was so happy that I didn't know what to do. I stared at Chairman Mao for about twenty minutes. I didn't breathe a sigh of relief until I couldn't see Chairman Mao's figure anymore.
    I had always wanted to see Chairman Mao in the past, and today I finally saw him. This is truly the greatest happiness in my life, and I will never forget this day.

　　我永远忘不了这个日子！
    平原省农业厅推广队一工人
    我是农民出身，从小家里很穷。全家有母亲、姐姐、哥哥和我四口人，只有三亩多地，还欠别人的债。家中没吃的，只得要饭。我从七岁起要饭，要到十三岁。因为肚了饿，我拾了地主家几穗庄稼，被他们打得脸青腿肿。当时我常常想：穷没有穷根，富没有富苗，穷人终有一天会抬起头来的。
    一九四四年，八路军来到冀鲁豫，领导人民抗日，还进行了减租减息………，后来又进行了土地改革。从此，农民翻身了。同时，我参加了工作。在共产党的领导下，我学习了文化、理论，提高了觉悟。我想，我们能得到解放，不受压迫，不受饥饿，都是毛主席领导得好。我时常听别人说，毛主席和战士谈话，和工人、农民谈话。我很羡慕，心里常想，我什么时候也能见到毛主席呢！
    今年九月初，我被调到北京中央人民政府农业部学习新农具知识，有机会参加了北京庆祝国庆节的大游行。在十月一日那天游行以前，我就想，不知道今天能不能见到毛主席。在我们队伍快到天安门时，我就注意看毛主席在那里。在数不清的人群里，红旗满天飘扬，腰鼓队的队员蹦跳着，我都没心看，光想看到毛主席。到了天安门前，大家都热烈地高喊毛主席万岁的口号。这时，我扒着同志们的膀子，竖起脚尖，直往天安门上看。终于，我看见毛主席站在天安门楼上正中，向游行队伍挥手，并且叫着：“同志们万岁！”我一看到毛主席，高兴得不知怎样才好，两眼望着毛主席，看了二十分钟左右。一直到看不见毛主席的影子，我才松了一口气。
    我过去一直想见毛主席，今天终于见到了。这真是我一生中最大的幸福，我是永远也不会忘记这个日子的。
