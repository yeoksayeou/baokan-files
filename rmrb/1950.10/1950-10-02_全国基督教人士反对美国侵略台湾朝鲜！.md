　　Warning to Imperialists
　　Zhao Zichen, Professor of Yenching University and Dean of the Theological Seminary
　　U.S. imperialism possesses atomic weapons and is increasing their production in active preparation for war. At the same time, peace-loving people around the world are doing everything possible to demand control of atomic bombs and a ban on the use of atomic weapons. In China, over one hundred million people have signed petitions for the defense of peace. We know that atomic weapons are sufficient to destroy culture and harm humanity. If their use is not prohibited, the harm to humanity will be immeasurable! We want to warn the imperialists who possess atomic weapons that these weapons can not only kill others but will ultimately destroy themselves. There is a saying in the New Testament: "Those who live by the sword, die by the sword." Our opposition to the use of atomic weapons is not only for the benefit of peace-loving people but also to awaken the warmongers, making them realize that using atomic weapons is a way to hasten their own demise. I hope that peace-loving people around the world will work together to defend world peace and resist the use of atomic weapons.

　　Oppose Imperialist War
　　Jiang Changchuan, Chairman of the North China Christian Joint Association in Beijing
　　We support the call issued by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, demanding the unconditional ban on atomic weapons and declaring the first government to use atomic weapons a war criminal.
　　Only two paths lie before the people of the world: the path of peace and the path of war. Except for a few warmongers headed by U.S. imperialism, the people of the world have decided to take the road to peace.
　　In the surging movement against imperialist war worldwide, China occupies an extremely important position. For over a hundred years, China has suffered all kinds of aggression from imperialism. In the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the four years of the War of Liberation, the Chinese revolution became a great force for peace and changed the face of the world. We must further unite the broad masses to support this peace camp.
　　We must not only oppose the use of atomic weapons but also oppose germ warfare and all inhumane wars, as well as their oppression of colonial peoples striving for democracy, independence, and democratic peace, and all other fascist measures.
　　We advocate universal disarmament, reduction of armaments, and the conclusion of a global peace pact with a spirit of friendship to achieve the highest goal of mankind: a world family and permanent peace.
　　Strive for Peace, Eliminate War!
　　Li Zong'en, President of Peking Union Medical College
　　Today, what the people of the world most urgently desire is lasting peace. However, the aggressive camp of imperialism, in order to maintain the interests of a few capitalists and save themselves from their inevitable crisis, is still妄想妄想 to launch wars, using atomic weapons to destroy humanity and culture. Now, the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union has become unprecedentedly strong. More than one billion people worldwide have joined this camp. If the warmongers dare to launch a war, it will surely lead to their own destruction. In order to actively strive for peace and defend peace, we should take peace signatures as our sacred responsibility. At the same time, we further support the recent proposal by the Soviet Union at the United Nations General Assembly to establish a lasting peace plan to prevent the threat of new wars and shatter the conspiracy of aggressors.

　　Support the Soviet Union's Peace Proposals
　　Zhao Chengxin, Professor of Yenching University
　　People around the world demand peace and oppose war. We Chinese people need peace even more to build our motherland, which has been devastated by war. Only imperialists and fascists need war to destroy peace in order to maintain their declining lives.
　　Peace-loving people around the world must unite and strive for lasting peace. We should wholeheartedly support the call of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress to defend world peace and ban atomic weapons, as well as the domestic signature campaign. We love peace. But we are not timid or afraid of imperialists. We will use the power of peace to strike at the warmongers. We fully agree with the declaration made by the Soviet Union at the United Nations General Assembly to prevent the threat of new wars and consolidate world peace and security.
　　Now, imperialists have launched a war of aggression in Korea, violated our country's sovereignty in Taiwan, and are preparing for further aggression there. We must stand with the Korean people against the aggressors. We must raise our political awareness. We must also strive for the liberation of Taiwan and Tibet. Long live national liberation! Long live people's democracy! Long live world peace!

　　Responding to the Peace Signature Campaign
　　Cui Xianxiang, General Secretary of the National General Association of the Church of Christ in China
　　Since the World Peace Congress issued the declaration to defend world peace and ban atomic weapons, a wave of peace signatures has swept the country. We Christians have always been lovers of peace. The promotion of this movement is of particular significance. In order to combat the conspiracies and tricks of the warmongers, we must raise our vigilance and use this signature campaign to earnestly achieve the following:
　　1. We must educate the masses to recognize the true face of imperialism! The masses within the church do not have a deep understanding of the nature and face of imperialism. We must use this signature campaign to educate them and expose all the conspiracies of imperialism to launch wars.
　　2. We must recognize that the force of peace is immensely powerful! With China's liberation, the force of peace has become unprecedentedly strong and is constantly expanding its influence. To ensure lasting peace for humanity, we must use the power of peace to eliminate the possible outbreak of a horrific atomic war.
　　3. We must treat the defense of peace as a long-term war task! Peace is not too easily won. The masses need to have a deep understanding of this. In addition to the domestic front, we should also strive to get peace-loving people within imperialist countries to rise up and fight together to defend world peace. Only in this way can we gradually strengthen the force of peace and ensure the safety of humanity.

　　Moving Towards the Light
　　Rao Yutai, Professor of Peking University
　　Today, humanity faces a dividing line regarding its entire destiny. This is the dividing line between peace and war, light and darkness, mutual assistance and carnage, creation and destruction. Standing on this dividing line, the vast majority of good people in the world know what to choose.
　　Standing from the standpoint of the Chinese people and scientific workers, we feel a double hatred for the threat of wars of aggression, especially the so-called atomic war. Since the Great October Revolution, two epoch-making events have occurred in human history in the past thirty-two years. One is the victory of the Chinese people, and the other is the realization of a tiny fraction of atomic potential (do not confuse atomic energy with atomic bombs). The former places the fate of a quarter of the world's population in their own hands; the latter places the material foundation on which all of humanity relies to create a beautiful and unlimited future in their own hands. These achievements, though great, are only the first step in a long march compared to their future potential. This requires lasting peace, creative labor, collective wisdom, and accumulated effort to reach the light. To this end, the Chinese people and all the people in the world who aspire to the light and live seriously must concentrate all their efforts to strive for lasting peace and ban atomic weapons.
　　The dignity of humanity and its reason do not allow people to return to the primitive dark ages.

　　Wholeheartedly Supporting Peace
　　Wang Zizhong, General Secretary of the North China Christian Joint Association in Beijing
　　I wholeheartedly approve and support the Stockholm Peace Appeal. Because what the world needs most now is peace, construction, and democracy. Whether we look at it from a humanitarian or Christian point of view, we should also support peace and oppose war, especially atomic bomb warfare. Because it not only cannot solve problems but also leads all mankind down the path of destruction. Therefore, people around the world should rise up and fight for peace, not be alienated and schemed against by warmongers, and wholeheartedly support peace. The power of the people is unlimited. As long as the majority of the people recognize the cruelty and inhumanity of atomic war, they will surely be able to stop the atomic war of the few warmongers.

　　Defending the UN Charter
　　Lei Jieqiong, Professor of Yenching University
　　U.S. imperialism launched a war of aggression against Korea, interfered in Korean internal affairs, armed and controlled Taiwan, and used aircraft to invade our Northeast, stepping up preparations for a world war and endangering human security. It has violated international treaties and the UN Charter. We Chinese people who love peace and freedom must more widely and deeply launch a peace signature campaign to expose the aggressive, interventionist, and war policies of U.S. imperialism based on facts in order to defend lasting world peace. At the same time, we must contribute all our strength to support the front line to liberate Taiwan, stand on the side of the Korean people, resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialist war of aggression, and support the Soviet Union's proposal at the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly to establish a lasting peace plan. We must defend the UN Charter and strive to make the United Nations a true tool for maintaining world peace and security.

　　Defend World Peace!
　　Song Ruhai, General Secretary of the Hankou YMCA
　　After the First World War, Christian progressives in the world called for the elimination of war and the maintenance of permanent world peace. However, because this was not universally promoted to all sectors of society, the Second World War broke out again. After the Second War, a strong World Peace Congress was established. After the Congress issued a call to defend world peace and ban atomic weapons at the Stockholm meeting, all peace-loving nations around the world unanimously supported this movement. Hundreds of millions of people have signed this peace movement, which is a concrete manifestation of the power of peace-loving people. This is comprehensive and universal. There are voices for peace and forces striving for peace in every corner of the world. The foundation of this peace movement is what we Christians wholeheartedly support. Because our doctrine opposes war and opposes all the evils in society, especially the atomic bomb, this weapon of mass murder. The Bible says, "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth," which clearly reveals to us and calls us Christians to not only oppose all wars of human aggression but to go a step further and use our strength and shed our blood to cleanse it, eradicate it, and eliminate it. I believe that all Chinese Christians have this responsibility to defend the completion of this great world peace movement, and they also have this determination to lay and consolidate the foundation of this great world peace movement!

　　Oppose the Use of Atomic Weapons in War
　　Yang Xiaopeng, General Secretary of the Tianjin YMCA
　　Two paths are clearly before us: one is peace, and the other is war. An even clearer fact is that the majority of people in the world like peace, and only those few warmongers who specialize in war want to plan and launch wars.
　　We are doing our best to launch a large-scale peace signature movement, with the aim of seeking the happiness of the majority of mankind and striving for peace. Signing is an expression of our wishes and a clear indication of our responsibility for supporting peace.
　　Conversely, imperialism, led by the United States, is preparing to manufacture another war and is even using inhumane atomic weapons. This is, of course, an arrogant move that violates the will of the majority of mankind and is a criminal act that despises the truth. We must oppose it and stop it.
　　We want peace; we oppose the use of atomic weapons in war. All acts of destruction that violate the truth will ultimately suffer their own destruction.

　　全国基督教人士反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜！
    警告帝国主义者
    燕京大学教授兼宗教学院院长  赵紫宸
    美国帝国主义，拥有原子武器，新近又加量制造，积极准备战争。同时，世界爱好和平的人们，竭尽全力要求原子弹之控制，禁止原子武器的使用，为保卫和平而签名者，在我中国已有一亿数千万人。我们知道：原子武器，足以毁灭文化，残害人类，若不禁止使用，则人类受害，将不知伊于胡底？！我们要警告拥有原子武器之帝国主义者，这种武器，不但能够杀害他人，至终也要毁灭自己。新约里有一句话说：“操刀者，必与刀一同灭亡。”我们反对使用原子武器，不但是为了爱好和平者的利益，也是唤醒战争贩子，使他们感觉到：使用原子武器是促使自己灭亡的办法。我愿意世界爱好和平的人们：齐心保卫世界和平，反抗原子武器的使用。
    反对帝国主义战争
    北京华北基督教联合会主席  江长川
    我们拥护世界保卫和平大会常设委员会所发出的号召，要求无条件的禁用原子武器，并宣布第一个使用原子武器的政府为战争罪犯。
    摆在世界人民眼前的只有两条路，一条是和平的道路，一条是战争的道路。除了以美帝为首的少数战争贩子以外，全世界的人民已经决定走这和平的大道。
    在全世界反对帝国主义战争的澎湃运动中，我们中国占着一个极其重要的位置。一百多年以来，中国受尽了帝国主义的种种侵略。在八年抗战，四年解放战争中，中国的革命成了伟大的和平的力量，并且改变了世界的面貌，我们更要团结广大的民众，来支援这和平的阵营。
    我们不只要反对使用原子武器，也要反对细菌战争和一切不人道的战争，也要反对他们对殖民地人民争取民主独立与民主和平的压迫，及其他一切法西斯的措施。
    我们主张：普遍裁军，消减军备，以友好的精神，来缔结一个全世界各国和平的公约，达到天下一家，永久和平之人类的最高鹄的。
    争取和平，消灭战争！
    北京协和医学院院长  李宗恩
    今天全世界人民所最迫切期望的就是永久和平。但是帝国主义的侵略阵营为了要维持少数资本家的利益，并挽救他们本身不可避免的危机，仍在妄想发动战争，利用原子武器来毁灭人类和文化。现在以苏联为首的和平阵营已经空前的强大起来。全世界已有十万万以上的人民参加了这个阵营。如果战争贩子敢于发动战争，那么一定是自取灭亡。我们为了主动的争取和平，保卫和平，应当把和平签名作为我们神圣的责任。同时我们更拥护最近苏联在联合国大会上所提出的建立持久和平方案，以便制止新战争的威胁并粉碎侵略者的阴谋。
    拥护苏联的和平建议
    燕京大学教授  赵承信
    全世界人民要求和平，反对战争。我们中国人民更需要和平来建设久经战争破坏了的祖国。只有帝国主义者法西斯主义者才需要战争破坏和平来维持自己将要衰亡的寿命。
    全世界爱好和平的人们要联合起来，争取持久和平。我们应全心全意拥护世界保卫和平大会常设委员会的保卫世界和平禁用原子武器的呼吁，以及国内的签名运动。我们爱护和平。但是我们并不胆怯、畏惧帝国主义者。我们要用和平的力量，打击战争贩子们。我们完全同意苏联在联合国大会上提出的制止新战争威胁，巩固世界和平与安全的宣言。
    现在帝国主义者已在朝鲜发动侵略战争，又在台湾破坏我国主权，并且在那里准备作更进一步的侵略。我们要站在朝鲜人民方面反对侵略者。我们要提高政治觉悟。我们更要为解放台湾和西藏而努力。民族解放运动万岁！人民民主万岁！世界和平万岁！
    响应和平签名运动
    中华基督教会全国总会总干事  崔宪详
    自世界保卫和平大会发出保卫世界和平禁用原子武器的宣言后，全国已展开和平签名的热潮，吾基督教人士一向为热爱和平者。对于此一运动之推行，尤感意义重大。为了打击战争贩子的阴谋诡计，吾人必须提高警惕，借这一次的签名运动，切实做到下列数点：
    一、必须教育群众，认识帝国主义真面目！教内群众对于帝国主义之本质及其面目，未能深切了解。必须借此次签名运动予以教育。并揭发帝国主义发动战争之一切阴谋。
    二、必须认清和平力量是强大无匹的！由于中国之获得解放，和平力量已空前强大，并在不断扩展其影响中。为了确保人类的永久和平，就必须运用和平的力量，来消灭可能爆发惨绝人寰的原子战争。
    三、必须把保卫和平作为一种长期的战争任务！和平并不是太容易争取得来的。需要群众对此有深刻的认识。除国内之外，并应争取帝国主义国家内之爱好和平人士，起来一致为保卫世界和平而奋斗。如此庶可逐渐加强和平力量，而确保人类之安全。
    向光明迈进
    北京大学教授  饶育泰
    今天，人类面临着一个关于它整个命运的分界线，这就是和平与战争，光明与黑暗，互助与残杀，创造与毁灭的分界线。站在这个分界线上，世界上绝大多数的良善人们是知所抉择的。
    站在中国人民和科学工作者的立场上，对于侵略战争，尤其是所谓原子战争的威胁，我们感觉到双重仇恨。自伟大的十月革命以来，三十二年间，人类史上出现了两件划时代的大事。一是中国人民的胜利，一是原子潜能一微小部分的实现（千万不要把原子能和原子弹混为一谈）。前者将世界四分之一的人类的命运掌握在自己手里；后者将全人类所凭借以创造美满无限的将来的物质基础掌握在自己手里。这些成就，虽然伟大，与其将来可能的成就比起来，不过是万里长征才走一步。这需要持久的和平，创造的劳动，集体的智慧，日积月累，才能达到光明的。为此，中国人民和世界上一切企望光明，严肃地生活着的人们一道，要集中所有的力量来争取持久和平，禁用原子武器。
    人类的尊严和它的理性，不容许人们回复到原始黑暗时代。
    万众一心拥护和平
    北京华北基督教联合会总干事  王梓仲
    我十二万分赞成与拥护斯德哥尔摩和平宣言。因为现在全世界所最需要的是和平、建设与民主，我们无论从人道主义或基督教的观点来看，也是应当拥护和平反对战争，特别是原子弹战争。因为它不但不能解决问题，而且是使全人类走入毁灭的途径，所以全世界的人应当起来为和平而奋斗，不要受了战争贩子的离间与阴谋，要万众一心的拥护和平。人民的力量是无限量的。只要大多数的民众认识了原子战争的残酷与不人道，一定能制止那少数战争贩子的原子战争。
    保卫联合国宪章
    燕京大学教授  雷洁琼
    美帝国主义发动对朝鲜的侵略战争，干涉朝鲜内政，武装控制台湾并用飞机侵犯我国东北，加紧准备世界大战，危害人类安全。它破坏了国际条约，违反了联合国宪章。我们爱好和平自由的中国人民，为保卫世界持久和平，必须更广泛更深入的展开和平签名运动，根据事实揭露美帝国主义的侵略政策、干涉政策与战争政策。同时贡献一切力量支援前线解放台湾，站在朝鲜人民方面，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略战争，拥护苏联在联合国第五届大会上提出的建立持久和平方案。我们要保卫联合国宪章，使联合国真正成为维护世界和平与安全的工具而奋斗。
    保卫世界和平！
    汉口基督教青年会总干事  宋如海
    在第一次世界大战后，世界上的基督教前进分子就号召消灭战争，保持世界永久和平的运动，而没有普遍的宣传到社会各阶层去，所以又有第二次世界大战爆发。第二次战争以后，产生了一个强有力的世界保卫和平大会，由该会在斯德哥尔摩会议发出保卫世界和平禁用原子武器的呼吁后，全世界爱好和平的民族，都是一致的拥护这个运动。而签名在这个和平运动的有数亿的人民，这就是爱好和平的人民力量的具体表现。这是全面性的，普遍的。世界上每个角落都有和平的呼声、都有争取和平的力量表现，这种和平运动的基础，是我们基督徒全心全意所拥护的。因为我们的教义，是反对战争，反对社会上一切的罪恶，尤其是用这集体杀人的武器原子弹。圣经说“以眼还眼，以牙还牙”的意思，就明显的启示我们，叫我们基督徒，凡是人类侵略的战争，我们不但仅只反对，而要更进一步的，用我们的力量，流我们的血，来洗涤他，铲除他，消灭他。我相信所有中国的基督徒，都有这种责任，来保卫这伟大的世界和平运动的完成，也都有这种决心，来奠定巩固这伟大世界和平运动的基础！
    反对使用原子武器的战争
    天津中华基督教青年会总干事  杨肖彭
    有两条路很清楚的摆在我们面前，一条是和平，一条是战争。更清楚的一个事实，乃是全世界的大多数人民都喜好和平，只有那少数专以战争为职业的战争贩子才想计划发动战争。
    我们尽力发动一个大规模的和平签名运动，目的在为了谋求全人类大多数人的幸福，争取和平。签名是表示我们的愿望，更表明我们对拥护和平这件事情的负责。
    相反的，以美国为首的帝国主义正在准备制造另一次战争，更要使用不人道的原子武器，这当然是违反人类大多数人的意志的狂妄举动，更是蔑视真理的犯罪行为。我们要反对它，制止它。
    我们要和平，我们反对使用原子武器的战争。一切违反真理的毁灭行为，至终是会遭到自身的毁灭的。
