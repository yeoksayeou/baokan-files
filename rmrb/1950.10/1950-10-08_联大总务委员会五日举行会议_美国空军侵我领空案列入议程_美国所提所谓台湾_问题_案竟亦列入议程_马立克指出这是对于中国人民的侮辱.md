Xinhua News Agency, New York, 5th. TASS dispatch: The UN General Committee held a meeting on the afternoon of the 5th to examine a number of requests to include additional items on the agenda of the UN General Assembly. The committee first examined the U.S. proposal to include the "Formosa (U.S. name for Taiwan) question" on the agenda. The General Committee had previously decided to postpone consideration of this question at the request of the Kuomintang representative - who said he would await instructions.

Even the Kuomintang element Jiang Tingfu opposed placing the Taiwan "problem" on the agenda after the General Committee meeting began on the 15th. He said: In the history of the United Nations, it is unprecedented for a member state government to question the territorial ownership of another country.

Soviet representative Malik strongly opposed including this item on the agenda because it violates the UN Charter and is an insult to the Chinese people who have won independence through fierce struggle. He said: Taiwan (Formosa) belongs to China, and international agreements, including the Cairo Declaration, have recognized this. The Cairo Declaration recognizes the indisputable fact that Taiwan belongs to China. The Yalta Agreement and the Potsdam Agreement both recognized the Cairo Declaration. Therefore, various international agreements have clearly restored China's sovereignty over Taiwan. No country has ever dreamed of discussing the territorial status of Taiwan in the past, not even the United States. Until January 5th of this year, the United States still recognized that Taiwan belonged to China. However, now the territorial status of Taiwan seems to have become unclear to the United States, and it is demanding that the UN General Assembly examine the "Formosa question." Malik then declared that because of the victory of the Chinese people over the Kuomintang, the United States took action on June 25th and later raised the Formosa question.

Subsequently, Malik pointed out that General MacArthur's letter to the "Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States" shows that the United States intends to turn Taiwan into a U.S. strategic base. Including the so-called "Formosa question" on the agenda means that the United Nations has the right to consider the status of any island (including islands occupied by the United States). Malik also stated that the U.S. proposal is intended to divert attention from U.S. aggression against China. Taiwan belongs to China, and the UN General Assembly should not review it. The UN General Assembly has the task of reviewing U.S. acts of aggression against China, and this matter has been placed on the agenda. Reviewing the "Formosa question" is tantamount to interfering in China's internal affairs, thereby violating the provisions of the UN Charter.

U.S. representative Austin defended the inclusion of this proposal on the agenda, nonsensically claiming that the U.S. aggression against Taiwan was caused by the military conflict in Korea. He insisted that putting this proposal on the agenda was for the sake of peace.

Australian representative Spender supported Austin's opinion and said that the Cairo Declaration has no right to bind countries that did not participate.

Malik replied to Spender that there is no reason to include this proposal on the agenda, as this is not a matter within the jurisdiction of the United Nations.

Subsequently, the committee decided to include the U.S. proposal on the agenda by a vote of ten to three.

The three votes against including this issue on the agenda were Malik (Soviet Union), Outrata (Czechoslovakia), and Kuomintang element Jiang Tingfu.

Afterwards, the General Committee decided to include on the agenda two items proposed by Yugoslavia: "Obligations of States in the Event of the Outbreak of War" and "Establishment of a Permanent Mediation Committee." The General Committee decided to refer these two items to the Political Committee for consideration.

Regardless of Malik's strong opposition, the General Committee decided by a vote of twelve to two to include on the agenda the proposal by the Philippines to award "honor ribbons or other medals" to all military personnel who opposed the Korean People's Army. Malik and Outrata voted against it.

The General Committee then turned to discuss the Soviet proposal of September 29th, namely, to request the UN General Assembly to include on its agenda the People's Republic of China's protest against the "U.S. Air Force's violation of Chinese airspace and the U.S. Air Force's strafing and bombing of Chinese territory."

At the beginning of the discussion of this issue, U.S. representative Austin asked: Does the Soviet Union intend to personally propose including the proposal on the UN General Assembly agenda, or is it limited to supporting the request made by the "Chinese Communist regime"?

Malik then spoke, first citing Zhou Enlai's note detailing the U.S. aggression against Chinese airspace, and then said: The Soviet Union supports the request made by the Chinese People's Government to review this issue, and proposes that this proposal be included on the agenda. Malik said: In supporting China's request, the Soviet delegation not only agrees with China's actions, but also firmly insists that this proposal be included on the agenda, and invites representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of this issue.

Chairman Andrian pointed out: This proposal must be submitted by a member state in order to be included on the agenda. He also proposed that China's complaint should be re-drafted to become a complaint by the Soviet delegation.

The committee then adjourned for a moment. During this time, the proposal that was requested to be included on the agenda was re-drafted as: The Soviet Union accuses the United States of violating Chinese airspace, strafing and bombing Chinese territory, and shelling Chinese ships.

After the committee reconvened, Kuomintang element Jiang Tingfu opposed including this proposal on the agenda. He uttered slanderous clichés against the People's Republic of China and attempted to defend the U.S. bombing of Chinese territory.

The General Committee then passed the motion to include this proposal on the agenda, with only the Kuomintang element opposing it. Austin suggested that this proposal be referred to the Special Political Committee for consideration. However, Malik suggested that it be sent to the Political Committee. The Chairman demanded a vote without waiting for discussion. As a result of the vote, the committee decided to refer this issue to the Special Political Committee. Representatives of eight countries voted in favor of this procedure, and representatives of two countries - Malik and Outrata - voted in favor of referring this issue to the Political Committee.

The General Committee then adjourned the meeting.

　　联大总务委员会五日举行会议
    美国空军侵我领空案列入议程
    美国所提所谓台湾“问题”案竟亦列入议程  马立克指出这是对于中国人民的侮辱
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约五日电：联合国总务委员会于五日下午举行会议，审议一些主张将额外的项目列入联大议程的请求。委员会首先审议美国提出的将“福摩萨（美国对台湾的称呼）问题”列入议程的请求。总务委员会前曾应国民党代表——他说他要等候训令——之请决定将此问题延缓审议。
    总务委员会会议于十五日开始后，甚至国民党分子蒋廷黻也反对将台湾“问题”列入议程中。他说：在联合国的历史中，一个成员国政府怀疑另一国家的领土所有权是空前未有的事情。
    苏联代表马立克强烈反对将此项目列入大会议程，因为这违反联合国宪章而且是对于经过激烈斗争而获得独立的中国人民的侮辱。他说：台湾（福摩萨）属于中国，包括开罗宣言在内的国际协定都已经承认了这一点。开罗宣言承认台湾属于中国这一无可争辩的事实。雅尔塔协定和波茨坦协定又都认可了开罗宣言。因此，各项国际协定已经明白地恢复中国管理台湾的主权了。没有那一个国家过去曾经梦想过要讨论台湾的领土地位问题，甚至美国也不曾作过这样的梦想。一直到今年一月五日，美国还承认台湾属于中国。可是，现在台湾的领土地位在美国看来竟然变得模糊不清了，它并且要求联大审议“福摩萨问题”了。马立克于是宣称：由于中国人民打败国民党的胜利，美国在六月二十五日便采取行动，后来又提出了福摩萨问题。
    随后，马立克指出，麦克阿瑟将军致“美国国外战争退伍军人协会”的信说明美国希图把台湾变为美国的战略基地。把所谓“福摩萨问题”列入议程就意味着，联合国有权考虑任何一个岛（包括美国所据有的岛屿在内）的地位。马立克又称，美国的提案旨在转移大家对美国侵略中国的注意。台湾属于中国，联合国大会不应对此审议。联大有任务审议美国对中国的侵略行动，而此事业经列入议程。审议“福摩萨问题”，就等于干涉中国的内政，从而就违犯了联合国宪章的规定。
    美国代表奥斯汀为将这一议案列入议程而申辩，胡说什么美国对台湾的侵略乃是朝鲜的军事冲突使然。他硬说，把这个议案列入议程乃是为了和平。
    澳大利亚代表斯宾德支持奥斯汀的意见，并说，开罗宣言无权约束未曾参加的国家。
    马立克回答斯宾德称，毫无理由把这个议案列入议程，这不是联合国管辖之内的问题。
    继而，委员会以十票对三票决定把美国所提的议案列入议程。
    反对把此问题列入议程的三票是马立克（苏联）奥特拉塔（捷克斯洛伐克）与国民党分子蒋廷黻。
    其后，总务委员会决定把南斯拉夫提出的两项即“在爆发战争时各国所负义务”与“建立常设调解委员会”列入议程。总务委员会决定把这两个项目交由政治委员会审议。
    总务委员会不顾马立克的强烈反对，以十二票对二票决定把菲律宾所提关于颁发“荣誉带或其他勋章”给予反对朝鲜人民军队的全体军事人员的提案列入议程，马立克与奥特拉塔投票反对。
    于是总务委员会转而讨论苏联在九月二十九日提出的提案，即请联大将中华人民共和国对“美国空军侵犯中国领空以及美国空军扫射并轰炸中国领土”的抗议列入其议程。
    在开始讨论这个问题时，美国代表奥斯汀问道：苏联是要亲自建议将议案列入联大议程，还是止于支持“中国共产党政权”所提出的请求呢？
    马立克继起发言，首先援引周恩来详细叙述美国侵略中国领空的照会，然后说道：苏联支持中国人民政府所提出的将此问题予以审议的请求，并且提议将此议案列入议程。马立克说：在支持中国请求中，苏联代表团不仅赞成中国的行动，而且它本身还坚决主张，将这一议案列入议程，并邀请中华人民共和国的代表参加关于这个问题的讨论。
    主席安迪让指出：这个议案必须由一个成员国提出以便列入议程。他并且提议：中国的控诉案应该重新拟订，使之成为苏联代表团的控诉案。
    委员会于是休会片刻。在这个时间内，被提出要求列入议程的这个议案重新拟订为：苏联控诉美国侵犯中国领空、扫射与轰炸中国领土及炮轰中国船只案。
    委员会复会后，国民党分子蒋廷黻反对将这个议案列入议程。他发表毁谤中华人民共和国的陈腔烂调，并且企图为美国轰炸中国领土的行为辩护。
    总务委员会于是通过将这一议案列入议程，仅国民党分子反对。奥斯汀建议将这个议案交由特别政治委员会审议。但是马立克建议将此送交政治委员会。主席没有等待讨论即要求表决。表决结果，委员会决定将这一问题送交特别政治委员会。八个国家的代表投票赞成这个程序，两个国家的代表——马立克和奥特拉塔投票赞成将此问题送交政治委员会。
    总务委员会于是宣布休会。
