    Beijing Hospital of Beijing
    Accepts Criticism and Improves Work

    To the Editor:

    After the publication of Comrade Hanliu's criticism of the irresponsible work of some doctors in our hospital's outpatient department in the People's Forum on September 7th, we held several meetings for deep self-examination. The hospital leaders also personally sought out Comrade Hanliu to solicit his opinions (but were unable to find him). During the inspection, we found that not only did these shortcomings exist in the outpatient department, but also in other departments:

    1. In the surgery department, after a plaster bandage was applied to patient Wei Shuyu, necrosis occurred in the patient's toes, resulting in the amputation of his toes. After Mr. Fu underwent surgery, he bled for twelve hours (approximately 200-300 CC). The patient asked the nurse to call a doctor to see him four times, but the doctor ignored him and did not visit.

    2. In the internal medicine department, patient He Shaohua was given three times the prescribed dose of "deworming medicine," resulting in severe poisoning, which has prevented him from working to this day.

    3. The pharmacy made four dispensing errors in June of this year, including mistaking "penicillin" for "streptomycin" and "vitamins" for "sedatives."

    4. Instances of nurses dispensing the wrong medicine or giving the wrong injections also occurred frequently, such as giving patients 40% "codeine" instead of 10%, using "gentian violet" as "magnesium sulfate," injecting "adrenaline" instead of "vitamin K," substituting appetite stimulants for cough medicine, and replacing intestinal antiseptics with digestive aids.

    5. An outpatient assistant even drew 10 CC of blood from a patient who had not yet been seen by a doctor. There was even an instance where a nurse broke a bottle of "penicillin" for injection and used expired medication instead.

    The main reason for the above errors is that our worldview is not yet clear enough, and we lack the spirit of serving the people and the sick and wounded. At the same time, we have been tainted by the Kuomintang's bad practices. The leadership also exhibits bureaucratic tendencies. In the future, we will actively work to improve our work, and we sincerely hope that people from all walks of life and comrades from government agencies and military units will provide more feedback.

    北京市北京医院
    接受批评改进工作编辑同志：
    九月七日人民园地发表寒流同志对本院门诊部某些大夫工作不负责任的批评后，我们曾召开了数次会议进行深刻检讨。医院负责同志又亲自去找寒流同志，征求他的意见（未找到）。在检查中，我们发现不仅门诊方面有这些缺点，就在其它科里也存在着不少的缺点：
    一、外科给病人魏树玉缠石膏绷带后，病人足尖竟发生坏死现象，因此把他的足尖切除了。傅某行手术后出血有十二小时之久（约有二三百ＣＣ），病人曾四次要护士请大夫来看，但大夫竟置若罔闻，不去探视。
    二、内科给病人贺少华服“驱虫剂”时，超过定量三倍，以致发生严重的中毒现象，使他至今不能工作。
    三、药房在今年六月间发错药四次，有将“青霉素”看成“链霉素”，把“维他命”误作“镇定药”等情况。
    四、护士发错药打错针的现象也层出不穷，如将４０％的“可达因”当１０％的交给病人，将“龙胆紫”当作“镁盐”使用，将“肾上腺素”当“维他命Ｋ”注射，将开胃药代替了咳嗽药，将肠内防腐药代替了助消化药等。
    五、门诊助理员竟把一位尚未经过医生看过的病人抽了十ＣＣ血。甚至有一位护士把病人注射的“盘尼西林”药瓶打破了，竟用过期的药注射。
    以上错误产生的原因，主要由于我们的人生观还不够明确，缺乏为人民为伤病员服务的精神；同时沾染了国民党的恶劣作风。领导上则有官僚主义的作风。今后我们要积极努力改进自己的工作，深望各界人士和机关部队同志多多提供意见。
