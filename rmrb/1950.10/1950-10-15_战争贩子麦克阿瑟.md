　　War-Monger MacArthur
    Maleike
    MacArthur's bloody record began as early as 1903 when the Philippine people were waging a national liberation war against Wall Street colonialists. At that time, the U.S. colonial army—MacArthur was a lieutenant in this army—massacred the Filipino people and suspected guerrillas upon sight, just as they are doing now in Korea.

    According to MacArthur's biographer, MacArthur once discovered a "guerrilla" who was unarmed except for a pocketknife in his pocket. Like a typical American rogue, he opened fire on this unarmed man at close range, emptying his bullets into the man's heart. Here is—in the words of MacArthur's biographer—the brazen language MacArthur used to describe his deeds:

    "He finally fell at my feet... When I turned him over, I could cover six bullet holes with one hand on his heart."

    MacArthur's second major achievement was in 1932, the year when tens of thousands of hungry, unemployed workers were wandering the streets of American cities in search of bread crusts. It was at this time that, as a result of the activities of his wealthy wife's wealthy friends, this former lieutenant jumped to the rank of major general. When two thousand five hundred unemployed World War I veterans marched on Washington from forty-eight states to demand their "war bonuses," the White House panicked. President Hoover summoned MacArthur and authorized him to drive all these "enemies" out of Washington.

    These "enemies"—including many of the wives and children of these unemployed marchers—were camping on the Anacostia Flats near Washington.

    To deal with these unarmed "enemies," including hungry men and their wives and children, MacArthur mobilized a thousand infantry, cavalry, tanks, and a group of armed police on the night of July 28, 1932. The famous progressive writer Kahn once described the attack on this unemployment camp in these words: "Powerful searchlights shone over the muddy ground, helmeted soldiers advanced throwing tear gas, set fire to the dilapidated tents, and chased the veterans and their families. At midnight, the sky over Washington shone like a conflagration."

    To boast of his "victory," MacArthur told reporters the next morning: "He saved the country from a revolution."

    The "victory" over the hungry masses stimulated this "hero" on the Anacostia Flats to turn to theory. In 1935, a military manual specifically for dealing with strikes appeared, signed with his name. His main method of dealing with strikes was "kill without mercy." MacArthur's bloody method shamelessly revealed the brutality of the fascists: "Never use blanks when dealing with mobs, and never fire shots into the air over their heads. Such actions will be seen as weakness..."

    To keep up with technology, MacArthur even advocated using airplanes to deal with the American working people, who, of course, are always portrayed as "mobs" and "rioters" in MacArthur's fascist vocabulary. His manual states: "Machine-gunning from airplanes and dropping tear gas and high-explosive bombs can drive rioters off rooftops."

    In the same manual, he expressed his views on democracy, similar to Hitler's in "Mein Kampf," saying: "Democracy is the direct rule of the people, and after experimentation, it has achieved nothing. Its result is mob rule, unrest, dissatisfaction, and chaos." He reached the same conclusion as Hitler, that democracy must be abolished.

    So it is not surprising that when the United States was engulfed in economic panic in 1943, and millions of unemployed masses were rioting, and strikes were commonplace, MacArthur was selected by a group of reactionary bankers to lead a fascist-style "march on Washington" to overthrow the Roosevelt government. This fascist rebellion plan, in which Truman's former Secretary of Defense Johnson was involved, was not realized only because a General White who had been drawn into the conspiracy leaked the secret.

    General White mentioned that MacArthur had been nominated as the "leader" of this march. He mentioned that a Wall Street financier named Clark had attempted to drag him into the conspiracy. In the conversation, Clark said, "I have thirty million in property, but I don't want to lose it. I'm willing to spend half of it to save the other half." Clark was an agent for a fascist organization called the "American Liberty League," and this league was the instigator of the conspiracy. Its directors had close ties with U.S. Steel, General Motors, Mobil Oil, Citibank, and more than a dozen other monopoly companies.

    MacArthur's career in World War II is famous for his inglorious retreat in the Far East theater. But military failure did not prevent him, just as it did not prevent his fellow American generals, from putting more money into his private pockets.

    The hypocrisy and distortion of facts of the spokesmen for the imperialist war camp can be seen in Truman, Churchill, Bevin, and Lie, who are trying to portray this unsuccessful "American leader," a self-proclaimed enemy of democracy and the butcher of the Korean people, as a "warrior" and "protector" of freedom.

    In MacArthur's disgraceful military career, the Korean People's Armed Forces have for the first time truly encountered serious resistance, resistance that is completely different from that of the unarmed, hungry, and unemployed workers of Anacostia. The heroic Korean People's Army, fighting for the independence of their motherland, has subjected the brazen MacArthur, who misappropriated the tainted UN flag, to a shameful defeat, forcing him to retreat in disgrace. The mad bombing of peaceful Korean towns and the brutal crimes committed against the Korean people cannot save the butcher MacArthur from final disgrace and complete and utter failure, as the Hitlerites suffered.

    The Korean people (and not just the Korean people) consider him a war criminal, and he and his supporters will soon receive their punishment.

　　战争贩子麦克阿瑟
    马莱克
    麦克阿瑟的血腥纪录从一九○三年菲律宾人民进行反对华尔街殖民者的民族解放战争时就已经开始了。那时候，美国殖民者的军队——麦克阿瑟是这个军队的一个中尉——一看见菲律宾的人民和嫌疑的游击队员就加以残杀，就象他们现在在朝鲜所做的一样。
    据麦克阿瑟传记的作者说，麦克阿瑟曾经发现过一个除了口袋里有一把日用小刀而外全无武装的“游击队员”。就象一个典型的美国流氓一样，他在一个很近的距离中向这个非武装的人开火，对准那个人的心脏射完了他的枪弹。这里就是——麦氏传记作者所引用的话——大言不惭的麦克阿瑟在描写他的事迹时所用的话语：
    “他最后在我的脚边倒下了……当我把他翻过身来时，我一只手放在他的心上可以盖住六个枪眼。”
    麦克阿瑟的第二大事迹是在一九三二，那一年正是成千累万的饥饿的失业工人踯躅在美国城市的大街上寻找面包皮的一年。正是在这个时候，由于他的豪富太太的豪富朋友活动的结果，这位先前的中尉一跃而取得了少将的头衔。当两千五百个失业的第一次世界大战退伍军人从四十八州走向华盛顿索取他们的“战争津贴”时，白宫发慌了。胡佛总统召见了麦克阿瑟，并且授权给他把这些“敌人”全部赶出华盛顿去。
    这些“敌人”——包括许多这些失业游行者的妻子和孩子们——露宿在靠近华盛顿的阿纳可斯狄亚野地上。
    为了对付这些包括饥饿的男人和他们的妻儿的手无寸铁的“敌人”，麦克阿瑟在一九三二年七月二十八日的夜晚出动了一千个步兵、骑兵、坦克以及一群武装的警察。著名的进步作家卡恩曾经用这样几句话来描写当时对于这个失业营的袭击：“强烈的探照灯在那块泥地上空闪耀着，戴着钢盔的兵士们投掷着催泪弹向前推进，并放火烧掉那些破烂的棚帐，追逐着退伍军人与他们的家属。在夜半的时候，华盛顿的上空照耀得如同一场大火。”
    为了夸耀他的“胜利”，第二天早晨麦克阿瑟对记者们说：“他将国家从一次革命中救出来了。”
    对饥饿群众的“胜利”，刺激着阿纳可斯狄亚野地上的这位“英雄”，使他转向理论了。一九三五年出现了一本专门对付罢工的军事手册，上面署有他的名字。他对付罢工主要办法就是“格杀勿论”。麦克阿瑟血腥的办法厚颜无耻地道出了法西斯蒂的残暴：“对付暴徒时决不能用空枪，同时也不能向暴徒头上空放枪。这样的作法会被认为软弱的……。”
    为了赶上技术，麦克阿瑟甚至倡导用飞机来对付美国的劳动人民，当然在麦克阿瑟的法西斯蒂语汇中，人民总是被描绘为“暴徒”、“暴动者”的。他的手册说：“用飞机机枪扫射，投掷催泪弹与烈性炸弹可以将暴徒们从屋顶上赶开。”
    在同一手册里，他发表了如同希特勒在“我的奋斗”中对民主的看法，他说：“民主乃是人民的直接统治，试验之后，并无成就。它的结果则成为暴民政治，骚动，不满与混乱。”他得到与希特勒相同的结论，就是必须取缔民主。
    所以当一九四三年美国笼罩在经济恐慌中，数以百万计的失业群众骚动着，罢工是家常便饭，麦克阿瑟被一群反动的银行家挑选出来，要他主持一次法西斯式的“向华盛顿进军”，以求推翻罗斯福政府，这是一点也不足为怪的。这次法西斯式的叛乱计划，杜鲁门政府的前任国防部长詹逊是有一份儿的，只因为被拉拢来参预这个阴谋的一个白托勒将军泄漏了秘密而未曾实现。
    白托勒将军述及麦克阿瑟曾被提名为此次进军的“领袖”，他谈到华尔街的一位金融家克拉克曾企图拖他参加阴谋，在谈话中，克拉克说：“我有三千万财产，但我不愿失掉它。我愿意用掉一半来保存那另一半。”克拉克是一个名叫“美国自由联盟”的法西斯团体的代理人，而这个联盟是阴谋的鼓动者，它的理事们与美国钢铁公司、通用汽车公司、美孚油公司、花旗银行和另外十多个垄断公司是有着密切的联系的。
    麦克阿瑟在二次世界大战中的生涯是以他在远东战场不光荣的撤退而出名的。但军事上的失败并没有阻止他，亦正如没有阻止和他同事的美国将领们一样，把更多的钱放入他的私囊之中。
    帝国主义战争阵营代言人的颠倒黑白，指鹿为马的丑态，可以从杜鲁门、邱吉尔、贝文及赖伊身上看得出来，他们努力要将这位没有成功的“美国领袖”、自称为民主敌人的人，朝鲜人民的屠夫描写成为自由的“武士”和“保护者”。
    在麦克阿瑟的不名誉的军事生涯中，朝鲜人民武装力量使他第一次真正遇到了严重的反抗，这种反抗和阿纳可斯狄亚的、没有武装的饥饿的失业工人的反抗完全不同。为祖国独立而战斗的英勇的朝鲜人民军使得窃用被玷污了的联合国旗帜的、大言不惭的麦克阿瑟遭受了可耻的失败，使他狼狈而退。对朝鲜和平市镇所进行的疯狂轰炸，对朝鲜人民所施行的残酷的罪行，并不能挽救屠夫麦克阿瑟使其免于最后的耻辱和完全彻底的失败，如同希特勒党徒所遭受的那样。
    朝鲜人民（而且不仅只是朝鲜人民）认为他是一名战争罪犯，他与他的支持者不久都将得到他们的惩罚。
