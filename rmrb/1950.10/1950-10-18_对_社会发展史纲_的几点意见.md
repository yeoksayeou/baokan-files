　　Some Opinions on "An Outline History of Social Development"
　　Zheng Hong
　　Essentially, "An Outline History of Social Development" (written by Hua Gang, published by Sanlian Bookstore as part of the "New China Youth Library") is a good book with correct viewpoints. Its other merits include clear organization and accessible writing. As the author himself stated: "To observe the development of Chinese social history within the overall scope of world history and give it appropriate evaluation," which it largely accomplishes. However, in detail, I believe there are many points that can be discussed.
　　First, it should be pointed out that according to the author's preface, the book was written before May 1940. Some issues may not have had a consensus at that time, especially since it was published in the "Kuomintang-controlled area." In order to avoid the attention of the reactionary government at the time, some places had to be deliberately written vaguely, which is forgivable. However, Sanlian Bookstore published this book as part of the "New China Youth Library," the first edition being in December 1949 and the second in March 1950. Neither edition underwent serious revision, nor did it have a reprinting preface. This attitude is not serious enough.
　　Now I will list some of the shortcomings I have found:
　　1. The book still uses "stratum" where it should use "class"; it does not mention Chairman Mao's leading role in history or the War of Liberation.
　　2. The book uses "production method" instead of the commonly used term "mode of production," which may cause confusion for beginners.
　　3. The book (pages 52-55) explains very definitively that the transition from ape to human was due to the ice age causing apes to leave the forest. According to Professor Pei Wenzhong's "From Ancient Ape to Modern Man": "As for the reason for the disappearance of the forest, geologists have two theories: (1) based on the European origin theory of mankind, which is that glaciers destroyed the forest. (2) based on the Asian origin theory of mankind, which is that after the Himalayas slowly rose, water vapor from the Indian Ocean was blocked on the southern slope of the mountains, so the rainfall in Central Asia on the north side of the mountains decreased, and the forest gradually disappeared due to the gradual reduction of rainfall." And then it says: "Now most geologists believe that the theory of the Himalayas slowly rising is more credible based on current knowledge."
　　From this, it seems that the reason for the disappearance of forests has not yet been determined. A social scientist should not make definitive conclusions based on subjective opinions when quoting materials from the natural sciences that are not yet conclusive.
　　Secondly, in the history of human development, the application of the three terms ancient ape, hominid (ape-man), and modern ape have today been very clearly distinguished, but this book does not clearly distinguish and apply them well (from pages 45 to 62); it even mixes up apes and monkeys, such as on page 61, fourth line: "From arboreal monkey groups to human society." This is an obvious mistake because humans did not evolve from monkeys, but from a branch of ancient apes (ape-men). Ancient monkeys were only close brothers of ancient apes. Below it continues to say "It is not known how many millions of years have passed, but human society eventually appeared." This is also an incorrect statement. We know that mammals did not appear until the Cenozoic Era in the Earth's development, and the Cenozoic Era is only about ten million years ago.
　　4. The book (page 65) says: "The Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. Of course, each era is at least ten thousand years or more." This is too arbitrary. Let's not talk about whether the European Iron Age is "of course" or not, but at least in Chinese history, it cannot be proven that there were iron tools in the slave society era before the Zhou Dynasty.
　　5. On page 71, it says: "In social science, the barbaric era is equivalent to tribal society." This sentence is also not well-considered. According to Engels' "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State," in Chapter 2, "The clan system seems to have arisen from the punalua family in most cases." Also, "Pairing family occurs on the boundary between savagery and barbarism, mostly in the highest stage of savagery, and only in the lowest stage of barbarism in individual cases." According to the above statement, the punalua family should be earlier than the highest stage of savagery, which means that tribal society existed at that time, and was very common in the highest stage of savagery. If it were said in this book that "the barbaric era is equivalent to tribal society," it would be as if the entire period of savagery was equivalent to pre-tribal society. So I think the writing is too brief.
　　6. In the book, page 77: "First, let's talk about savages... they have not yet invented bows and arrows." This is also incorrect. In the chapter "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State," it is clearly stated that the "highest stage" of savagery "begins with the invention of the bow and arrow. Because of the bow and arrow, game became a daily food, and hunting became one of the normal departments of labor."
　　7. The author's view that "the Chinese feudal system began around the end of the Western Zhou Dynasty" is also worth reconsidering. Most Chinese historians today believe that China entered feudal society after King Wu of Zhou destroyed the Shang Dynasty.
　　These are my opinions after reading Comrade Hua Gang's "An Outline History of Social Development." This book has a considerable circulation, and these shortcomings may have a great negative impact on beginners. Therefore, I request the author to provide an explanation, and I hope that Sanlian Bookstore will print detailed explanations and sell them together with the book before the uncorrected reprint, in order to be responsible to the readers.

### 对“社会发展史纲”的几点意见

　　对“社会发展史纲”的几点意见
    征鸿
    “社会发展史纲”（华岗著，三联书店“新中国青年文库”版）从基本上说，是一册观点正确的好书。此外如条理分明，写得深入浅出，都是它的优点。著者自己说的：“把中国社会历史的发展在世界史的全体范围上来观察，而给以适当的评价。”大体上也确实做到了。不过在细节上，我认为还有不少可以商榷的地方。
    首先要指出的，根据著者自序，本书写成的时间是在一九四○年五月以前，有些问题在那时大抵还没有一致的结论，尤其是它是在“国统区”出版的，为了避免当时反动政府的注意，有的地方就不得不故意写得含混些，这是可以原谅的。但是三联书店以“新中国青年文库”来出版本书的时间，第一版是一九四九年十二月，第二版是一九五○年三月，这两版都没有作严肃的修改，也没有一篇重版序言，这种态度是不够严肃的。
    现在就我所发现到的一些缺点列举如下：
    一、书中应该用“阶级”的地方，还是用着“阶层”；对毛主席在历史中的领导作用和解放战争，都没有提到。
    二、对惯用的“生产方式”一词，书中用着“生产方法”，可能引起初学者的混乱。
    三、书中（五二——五五页）说明从猿到人是因为冰河的关系使猿离开了森林的，说得非常肯定。据裴文中教授的“从古猿到现代人”一文中说：“至于森林消灭的原因，地质学家有两种说法：（一）是人类欧洲起源说所根据的，也就是冰川消灭了森林的说法。（二）是人类亚洲起源说所根据的，也就是说喜马拉雅山慢慢的突起之后，由印度洋吹来含水汽的云被阻止在山的南麓，因而山北面的中亚一带雨量减少，森林因雨量渐减而渐渐消灭。”并且接着说：“现在一般的地质学家，多半认为喜马拉雅山慢慢突起的说法，就现在的知识论是比较可信的。”
    从这样看来，森林消灭的原因至今还没有定论，一个社会科学者在引用自然科学范围的、尚无定论的材料时，是不应凭主观下肯定的论断的。
    其次，在人类发展史上，对古猿、类人猿（猿人）、现代猿这三个名词的应用，今天已非常明确地分别开来的了，本书里却并没有很好的明确分别应用（自四五到六二页）；甚至把猿和猴也混用起来，如六一页第四行的“由缘木猴群，进而为人类社会。”这一个错误是明显的，因为人并非由猴演进而来的，而是由古猿的一支（猿人）演进来的，而古代的猴只是古猿的亲近兄弟。下面又接着说“其间不知经过多少千万年，然而人类社会毕竟出现了。”这也是不正确的说法。我们知道地球发展到新生代之后，才有哺乳动物的出现，而新生代距今大约只有一千万年以下。
    四、书中（六五页）说：“石器时代、铜器时代与铁器时代。当然每一个时代，至少是在一万年以上的。”这未免太武断了。我们且不说欧洲的铁器时代“当然”与否，至少在中国的历史上，周以前的奴隶社会时代还不能证明有铁器的出现哩。
    五、第七一页上说：“在社会科学上所称的野蛮时代，即相当于氏族社会。”这句话也是欠斟酌的。根据恩格斯的“家族私有财产及国家的起源”一书第二章里说：“氏族制度，在大多数场合下，似乎是从普那路亚家族中发生的。”又“对偶家族发生于蒙昧与野蛮之间的境界上，大半是在蒙昧的最高阶段上，在个别场合之下只是在野蛮的最低阶段上。”照以上的说法，普那路亚家族应更早于蒙昧期的最高阶段，也就是说氏族社会在那时就有了，而在蒙昧最高阶段当就很普遍了。如照这本书上所说“野蛮时代即相当于氏族社会”的话，就好象整个蒙昧时期相当于前氏族社会了。所以我觉得行文过于简略。
    六、书中七七页：“首先就蒙昧人说……也还没有发明什么弓矢。”这也不对。在“家族私有财产及国家起源”的一章中曾明白的说，蒙昧期的“最高阶段是从弓矢的发明开始时，猎物因为有了弓矢，便成了日常的食物，而打猎成了正常的劳动部门之一。”
    七、著者认为“中国封建制度，大约起自西周末期。”的观点也值得重新考虑。现在的中国历史学家大多认为西周武王灭纣后就进入了封建社会。
    这是我读华岗同志的“社会发展史纲”后的意见，这册书的销路相当广，这些缺点，可能给予初学者很大的不好影响，因此要请求著者加以说明，并希望三联书店在未改正重版前，对未售完的书籍，要另印详细的说明连同此书出售，以示对读者负责。
