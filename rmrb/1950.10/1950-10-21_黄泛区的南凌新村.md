    The Nanling New Village in the Yellow River Flooded Area
    By our reporter, Lu Sheng
    Nanling was one of the thousands of villages destroyed in the former Yellow River flooded area, once silted up into a yellow mud field by the Yellow River. Since then, no one lived in the village. Landlords moved into towns and continued their extravagant lives; peasants scattered and fled from the famine, enduring ten years of hardship. In those ten years, more than four hundred people died of starvation. It was not until the autumn of 1947, when Liu Deng's army liberated the entire Xihua County, that the farmers of Nanling Village, who had been wandering for ten years, returned to their long-lost home one after another.
    The home was a yellow mud swamp, the land a field of reeds. There was no road to find the village, and no one to ask for directions. Only the brick-built building of the landlord's family still showed the top of the building, and the tall willow tree had a treetop. People looked at the top of the building, looked at the treetop, the elderly relied on memory, and the young people plucked up courage to step out a small road from the yellow mud. The old man Ling Shui, with his family of six, returned to the village. There was no house to live in, and no food to cultivate wasteland. After thinking about it, there was no way out. He said hopelessly: "It's better to flee from the famine again!" Just as the farmers were panicking, the People's Government sent District Chief Hou. District Chief Hou found Ling Timin, who was the most active in the Anti-Japanese War back then, and asked him to gather the villagers and tell everyone: "The Chiang Kai-shek bandits dug the Yellow River, causing us to flee from the famine for ten years, and suffering unspeakable hardships. Now that everyone has returned, we must settle down and the Communist Party and the People's Government will definitely help everyone rebuild their homes. If there is no house to live in, first cut reeds to build thatched huts, if there is no food to eat, cut grass to Zhoukou to exchange for sweet potatoes and grain. As long as everyone works together, the difficulties can definitely be overcome." The farmers of Nanling Village saw that the Communist Party and the People's Government were in charge, and their confidence in rebuilding their homes was enhanced. The next day, experienced old people and women cut grass to build thatched huts, and young people went down to the yellow water to catch fish... Since then, the farmers of Nanling Village have been building their homes in the mud.
    Unexpectedly, in the first month of the following year, there was a heavy snowfall of more than a foot, and the doors of the thatched houses were blocked. The old man Ling Shui sighed repeatedly, and he said: "This is another difficult hurdle, even if we don't starve to death, we will freeze to death."
    In this heavy snow, the Xihua County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government mobilized cadres to step through the snow and distribute 600,000 jin of grain, 9.47 million yuan of vegetable money donated by the Party, government, army and people in the entire district, more than 100 horses obtained by the People's Liberation Army in Xuchang, 3,000 jin of cotton, more than 1,000 pieces of clothing, etc., to various villages to rescue the farmers who were severely attacked by hunger and cold.
    District Chief Hou came to Nanling Village, and he and several district cadres brought the grain, clothes and horses distributed by the government. Grain and clothing were distributed to 30 households such as Ling Wuying who had no food and clothing at the moment. At the same time, he told everyone: "The government's relief can only help everyone get through this most difficult hurdle. To completely overcome difficulties and survive the famine, we still rely on everyone's cooperation and mutual assistance, and production for self-rescue." The farmers remembered these two sentences. When the ice and snow melted, they organized themselves to help each other reclaim wasteland.
    The biggest difficulty in reclaiming wasteland was the lack of livestock and farm tools, which was solved by cooperation and mutual assistance. Ling Laibin and Ling Ta jointly bought a donkey, and Ling Timin and Ling Shizhen jointly bought a large cart. With livestock and farm tools, Nanling Village set off a wave of wasteland reclamation. After the wheat harvest, the 14 wasteland reclamation mutual aid groups in the village were transformed into house-building mutual aid groups, and each family built a larger thatched house. By autumn, the village had reclaimed more than 1,600 mu of wasteland. Together with the 1,400 mu of land reclaimed by the tractor team received from the Kuomintang, a total of 3,000 mu of wheat were sown. The following year - in the spring of 1949, all the wasteland in the village had been reclaimed, and another 4,000 mu of wheat were planted in the autumn. This summer, the wheat had a bumper harvest, and each family, in addition to paying off the old debts of previous years, had enough to eat for half a year to a year. If there is another bumper harvest this autumn, life will be somewhat improved.
    Now, Nanling Village, relying on the hard work of the people of the whole village for the past three years, has built a yellow mud swamp into a brand new village. They cut down the branches of the old willow trees and planted rows of small willow trees on both sides of the four streets of the village. Next to the green willow trees, 162 new thatched houses were built. In the morning, the red glow of the sun just shines on the tender green willow trees and yellow thatched houses, and the farmers have already gone to work in the fields. In the houses, the elderly grandmothers are watching the children while cooking. At noon, the male and female mutual aid team members return from the fields, tie the 116 cattle, horses, and mules that they have bought over the past three years under the willow trees, and sit around in a circle, eating and discussing the work for the afternoon. After supper, the old grandmothers take their grandchildren to see the tractor, and the male and female mutual aid team members go to the meeting. In the landlord's building, which could only be looked at in the past, they record work and evaluate work, and discuss things for tomorrow. The joyful voices of the primary school students are filled around the village, and they sing "The East is Red."
    In the past, in the years of famine, men vented their anger at the landlords on their wives. Men beat their wives, and mothers-in-law quarreled with their daughters-in-law. There was no peaceful day! Now, the relationship between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law is normal. One day, labor model Gao Yumei fell asleep from exhaustion, and when the mutual aid group called her to a meeting, her mother-in-law quickly woke her up. When a mad dog bit Gao Yumei's foot, her mother-in-law quickly bandaged her wound and went everywhere to invite doctors and buy medicine. Lu Xiuying married Ling Xueming at the age of fourteen. After the marriage, there was famine every day. When the yellow water came, they fled everywhere. They had no children for thirteen years of marriage. In March this year, Lu Xiuying gave birth to a baby boy, and the two couples were always smiling happily. For more than ten years, there were fewer births and more deaths in the village. In the three years of rebuilding their homes, more than forty children have been added to the village. In the past, as soon as a girl reached the age of fourteen, her mother had to sell her to be a child bride. Now, some women are twenty years old and are still with their mothers. A matchmaker wanted to introduce Ling Ji to a marriage. The girl said, "The person I am looking for is a Communist Party member, and he must be a labor hero. Find one for me."
    As in previous years, the tractor second detachment still lives in the courtyard in the middle of the village, and the more than ten tractors are still parked in the square outside the gate. In the past, they drove tractors and ran rampant in the village, and even they themselves didn't know why they drove like that. Farmers stayed far away from them. Today, those red "Maz" machines, yellow "Carmen" machines, green sowing machines, and gray "Ford" machines are still parked there, but the people who drive the machines have changed. Whenever the farmers have time, they go to the driver and ask questions: Why can the tractor sow seeds? Where can it be started? The driver patiently explains and encourages the farmers to learn to drive the machines. At the same time, they also learn farming knowledge from the farmers. This autumn, they planted mung beans for Nanling Village. According to the previous method, they first plowed and then loosened the soil, and then sowed the seeds. This time the farmers told them: Plow, loosen the soil, and sow at the same time, which can retain moisture and allow the beans to germinate early. The workers listened and changed the old farming method. The farmers, encouraged by them, also wanted to learn how to use the new machines. The young men and women in the village are working hard to learn culture and prepare to learn to drive tractors.

    黄泛区的南凌新村
    本报记者  鲁生
    南凌，这是原来黄泛区数千个被毁村庄中的一个，曾被黄河水淤成一片黄泥。从那时起，村里就没有人烟了。地主搬进城镇，继续着奢侈的生活；农民四散逃荒，度过了整整十个苦难的年头，十年来，死亡于饥饿的，有四百多人。直到一九四七年秋天，刘邓大军解放了西华全县，流浪十年的南凌村农民，才陆续回到久别的家乡。
    家乡是一片黄泥潭，土地是一片芦苇草，寻村没有路，问路没有人。只有那大地主家砖砌的楼房还露着楼顶，高大的柳树还有一个树梢。人们望着楼顶，望着树梢，老年人凭着记忆，青年人鼓着勇气，从黄泥里踏出一条小路。老头子凌水，带着一家六口回村了，住房没房，想开荒地没有粮吃，左思右想没办法，他无望地说：“不如再逃荒走吧！”正在农民们心慌不定的时候，人民政府派侯区长来了。侯区长找到了当年抗日最积极的凌体民，请他把村民召集起来，告诉大家：“蒋匪扒黄河，使我们逃了十年荒，受罪受苦一时说不完。现在大家既回来了，就要安心住下来，共产党和人民政府，一定帮助大家重建家园。没房住，先割芦草搭草庵，没吃的，割草到周口去换红薯、粮食，只要大家齐心干，困难一定能克服。”南凌村农民见有了共产党和人民政府作主，重建家园的信心提高了。第二天，有经验的老人和妇女割草搭草庵，青年人下黄水捉鱼……从此，南凌村农民在泥潭里建设自己的家园了。
    想不到，第二年正月下了尺多厚的大雪，草房的门子都给堵塞了。老头子凌水连声叹气，他说：“这又是一个难关，饿不死也要冻死。”
    在这漫天的大雪里，中共西华县委会和人民政府，把六十万斤粮食，全分区党政军民捐助的九百四十七万元菜金，人民解放军在许昌得的一百多匹马，三千斤棉花，一千多件衣服等物，动员干部踏着大雪分送到各村，抢救那些遭受严重饥寒袭击的农民。
    侯区长来到南凌村了，他和几个区干部送来了政府发放的粮食、衣服和马匹。粮食和衣服分给了当下没吃穿的凌武英等三十户。同时告给大家：“政府的救济，只能帮助大家度过这最难的一关，要彻底克服困难度过灾荒，还靠大家合作互助，生产自救。”农民们记住了这两句话，等到冰雪一消，就组织起来，互助开荒。
    开荒当中的顶大困难是没有牲口农具，这全靠合作互助解决了。凌来宾和凌他合伙买了一头驴，凌体民和凌世珍合伙买了一辆大车。有了牲口，有了农具，南凌村掀起了一片开荒潮。收麦以后，全村十四个开荒互助组，转成盖房互助组，每家都修起一座大些的草房。到秋天，全村共开了一千六百多亩荒，连从国民党手里接收的拖拉机队开的一千四百亩地，总共播种了三千亩麦子。第二年——一九四九年的春天，全村已经开光了荒地，秋天又种了四千亩麦子。今年夏天，麦子大丰收，每家除了还清历年旧账，还够半年到一年吃的。今秋再来个丰收，生活就能有些改善了。
    现在的南凌村，靠着全村人民三年来的苦斗，把一片黄泥潭建设成崭新的村庄。他们砍下老柳树的枝干，在村子的四条街道两旁，栽起一行行的小柳树。在青青的柳树旁边，建筑起一百六十二所新草房。早上，太阳的红色光芒，刚刚射到嫩绿的柳树和黄色的草房上，农民们已经到地里去劳动了，房子里，上年纪的老大娘正边看小孩边做饭。正午，男女互助组员从地里回来，把三年来添买的一百一十六头牛、马、骡拴在柳树下，团团围着坐，一边吃饭，一边讨论下半天的工作。吃过夜饭，老大娘们抱着孙孙去看拖拉机，男女互助组员开会去了，在那过去只能看看的地主楼房里，记工评工，讨论明天的事情。小学生的欢声，洋溢在村周，他们高唱着《东方红》。
    过去，在灾荒的年月里，男人受了地主的气，回家在老婆身上出，男人打老婆，婆婆吵媳妇，那里有个安生的日子！现在，婆媳关系是正常了。有一天，劳动模范高玉梅累得睡熟了，当互助组喊叫她开会的时候，婆婆赶快叫醒了她。疯狗咬了高玉梅的脚，婆婆赶快给她裹伤，到处去请医生，买药。陆秀英十四岁就和凌学明结了婚，婚后天天闹饥荒，黄水一来，又到处逃难，结婚十三年连个小孩也没有。今年三月，陆秀英生下个小男孩，喜的两口子老是笑眯眯的。十多年来，村里是生的少死的多，在这重建家园的三年间，全村增添了四十多个小孩。过去，姑娘刚长到十四岁，母亲就不得不卖出去给人当童养媳。而今，妇女有的长到二十岁了，还在母亲跟前。有个媒婆，要给凌纪说媒，这姑娘说：“我找的人是共产党员，还得是劳动英雄，你给我找吧。”
    和往年一样，村当中的房院里，还住着拖拉机第二分队，院门外的方场里还停着那十多部拖拉机。从前他们开上拖拉机在村里横冲直撞，连他们自己也不知道为什么要那样开。农民离得他们远远的。今天，那些红色的“麦斯”机，黄色的“卡门机”，绿色的播种机，灰色的“福特机”，还照样停在那里，开机器的人可变了。农民一有空，就走到司机跟前，问长问短：拖拉机为什么会下种？动那里能开动？司机耐心地讲解着，鼓励农民学开机器。同时他们也向农民学习耕作知识。今秋，他们给南凌村种绿豆，照过去的作法，他们是先犁后松土，然后再下种。这次农民告诉他们：随犁随松土随种，能保持水分，好让豆子早发芽。工人听了，改变了旧的耕作法。农民也因为受到他们的鼓励，都想学学使用这新机器，村里的男女青年正努力学习文化，准备学习驾驶拖拉机。
