Xinhua News Agency, 23rd Dispatch: Comprehensive TASS, New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee discussed and voted on the joint proposal by Iraq and Syria on "United Action for Peace" on October 20th and 21st, finally concluding all discussions on the "United Action for Peace" case.

The original proposal by Iraq and Syria suggested that the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France consult to discuss and resolve important issues threatening world peace and paralyzing the United Nations, and report the results to the General Assembly. The Soviet Union proposed an amendment to this proposal at the meeting on the 19th, suggesting that the People's Republic of China should be included among the major powers participating in the discussion of world issues.

Iraq and Syria presented a revised proposal at the meeting on the 20th, suggesting that the five permanent members of the Security Council participate in the major power conference.

Syrian representative El-Ghouri, speaking on the revised proposal, said that the guarantee of international peace and security relies primarily on the cooperation of the five permanent members of the Security Council, and that an agreement among the five major powers would bring happiness to the people of the world. He urged the permanent members of the Security Council to continuously strive to eliminate differences between each other.

The Soviet Union proposed an amendment to the new proposal, suggesting that the names of the corresponding countries should be listed after the five permanent members of the Security Council in the proposal, and that the People's Republic of China should be proposed as a permanent member.

While the US representative Dulles and the UK representative Younger outwardly supported the joint Iraqi-Syrian proposal, they attempted to cast doubt in advance on the success of the proposed major power talks, thereby reducing the practical significance of the proposal.

At the meeting on the 21st, Iraq and Syria presented the final proposal, but it still did not include the Soviet amendment.

Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky said: "From the very beginning of the discussion of the Iraqi and Syrian proposal, the Soviet delegation has firmly maintained that this proposal, which we largely support, should not contain ambiguous wording; facts and things in the proposal should be called what they are, without any fiction. From the diplomatic point of view that only diplomats themselves understand, fiction is very convenient. But for the country we represent here, this diplomacy is completely incomprehensible. Our country is keenly concerned that diplomacy should serve the interests of the people, not be used against the interests of the people."

Vyshinsky pointed out that the proposal must clearly specify who the proposed major power talks are for, otherwise, it will be based on fiction. The concept of "permanent member" in the proposal should be explained, because some delegations still dispute who represents China, and there are some differences of opinion on how to understand this concept.

Vyshinsky emphasized the enormous role played by the People's Republic of China in resolving all international issues. He declared that China must be represented by its legitimate representative, namely the representative of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.

Vyshinsky then sharply criticized US representative Dulles's speech on October 20, in which he tried to prove that "a universally consistent world is a boring world." Vyshinsky exposed the harm of this idea to the cause of peace and convincingly explained the harmful effects of this idea on human progress and especially on the cause of international cooperation.

Vyshinsky finally firmly insisted that the committee should adopt the Soviet amendment.

The Kuomintang representative opposed the Soviet amendment.

Syrian representative El-Ghouri said that if the Political Committee adopted the Soviet amendment by a majority, the Syrian delegation would be willing to accept the amendment. He said that the proposing countries also agreed with Vyshinsky's opinion in his speech that the proposal should not be ambiguous. But El-Ghouri said: the proposing countries "cannot arbitrarily decide" who should represent China in the talks stipulated in the proposal, because the issue of China's representation is still under consideration by the General Assembly.

However, the Chairman of the Political Committee, the Colombian representative Abilaz, supported the Kuomintang elements' suggestion, believing that the Soviet amendment was "unacceptable."

Soviet representative Vyshinsky opposed the chairman's ruling. He said: "Passing the Soviet amendment does not mean that the committee is attempting to decide the issue of China's representation in the United Nations, but merely expressing that the Political Committee believes who should represent China in the talks between the permanent members of the Security Council."

Vyshinsky recalled that, in fact, in China, there is only one government qualified to speak for China, namely the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.

Subsequently, the chairman's ruling was put to a vote. As a result, the ruling was passed by twenty-six votes (Turkey, the Union of South Africa, Kuomintang elements, and other countries) to thirteen votes (the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the United Kingdom, India, Norway, Argentina, and other countries); sixteen delegations abstained (the United States, Burma, Syria, and other countries).

Vyshinsky then proposed a new wording for the Soviet amendment. He suggested that the Iraqi and Syrian proposal be amended in the following way: after the words "permanent members of the Security Council," the words "including the People's Republic of China" should be added. Vyshinsky emphasized that if such an amendment were passed, the committee would only be expressing an opinion on who must participate in the talks, rather than on the issue of China's representation in the United Nations.

US representative Dulles opposed the new amendment. He proposed declaring this amendment "unacceptable."

The US representative's proposal was immediately put to a vote. Thirty-five delegations voted in favor of the proposal, twelve delegations (the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the United Kingdom, India, Denmark, etc.) voted against it, and eleven delegations (Argentina, Yemen, Syria, Norway, etc.) abstained.

Afterward, the Political Committee voted on the Iraqi and Syrian proposal, which was unanimously passed by the committee.

The discussion on the "United Action for Peace" case has now concluded. The committee's meeting on October 23rd will begin discussing the Soviet proposal for a "Declaration on Halting the Threat of a New War, Consolidating World Peace and Security."

　　联大政委会通过伊叙联合提案
    建议五大国会商解决威胁和平的问题苏联代表坚持应有我国代表参加讨论
   【新华社二十三日讯】综合塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会十月二十、二十一两日讨论并表决了伊拉克及叙利亚两国就“保障和平的联合行动”案所提出的联合提案，最后结束了对“保障和平的联合行动”案的全部讨论。
   伊拉克及叙利亚的原提案是建议苏、美、英、法四国在进行会商，以讨论并解决威胁世界和平和瘫痪联合国的重要问题，并将结果向大会汇报。苏联在十九日会议曾对这提案提出一修正案，建议中华人民共和国应列入参加讨论世界问题的各大国。
   伊拉克及叙利亚两国在二十日会议上提出修正后的提案，建议由安理会五常任理事国参加大国会议。
   叙利亚代表埃尔——古里就修正后提案发言说：国际和平及安全的保障首先是依赖于安理会五常任理事国的合作，五大国取得协议就将给全世界人民带来幸福。他敦促安理会常任理事国不断努力来消除彼此间的歧见。
   苏联对新提案提出修正案，建议提案中安理会五常任理事国应列举相应国家的名称，并应将中华人民共和国作为常任理事国提出。
   美国代表杜勒斯及英国代表杨格虽在表面上支持伊拉克及叙利亚联合提案，但企图使人预先对拟议中大国会谈的成功表示怀疑，而减低这提案的实际意义。
   在二十一日会议上，伊拉克及叙利亚两国提出最后定案，但仍未包括苏联修正案在内。
   苏联代表团团长维辛斯基发言说：从一开始讨论伊拉克和叙利亚两国的提案时起，苏联代表团就坚决主张：这个为我们所大体上支持的该提案不应当有含糊不清的词句；提案中的事实和事物是什么就应当称他们做什么，而不应当有任何虚构。从那种只有外交家们自己懂得的外交观点看来，虚构是很方便的。但是对于我们在这里所代表的国家来说，这种外交是全然不能理解的。我们国家热烈关心的是：外交应当为人民的利益服务，而不应当用来反对人民的利益。
   维辛斯基指出：提案必须明确规定所建议之大国会谈系对谁而发，否则便是建立在虚构的基础上。提案中“常任理事国”概念应当加以解释，因为某些代表团对于谁代表中国还有争执，究竟应如何了解这个概念就有一些分歧的意见。
   维辛斯基强调中华人民共和国在解决所有国际问题中所起的巨大作用。他声言，中国必须由其合法的代表，即中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表来代表。
   维辛斯基随后即尖锐批评美国代表杜勒斯十月二十日演说中力图证明“普遍一致的世界是乏味的世界”。维辛斯基揭露这种观念对和平事业的祸害，并且令人信服地说明了这种观念对于人类进步而且特别是国际合作事业的一切有害影响。
   维辛斯基最后坚决主张委员会应采纳苏联的修正案。
   国民党代表反对苏联修正案。
   叙利亚代表埃尔——古里说，如果政治委员会以多数通过了苏联的修正案，叙利亚代表团愿意接受该修正案。他说，提案国也同意维辛斯基在演说中指出的关于提案不可含糊其词的意见。但埃尔——古里说：提案国“不能随便决定”谁应该代表中国参加提案中所规定的会谈，因为中国代表权的问题还在联大审议之中。
   而政治委员会主席哥伦比亚代表阿彼拉兹竟支持国民党分子的建议，认为苏联的修正案“不能接受”。
   苏联代表维辛斯基反对主席的此项裁决。他说：通过苏联的修正案决不意味着委员会企图决定中国在联合国的代表权问题，而仅仅是表示政治委员会认为，究竟谁应该代表中国参加安理会常任理事国间的会谈。
   维辛斯基追述称：事实上，在中国，有资格代表中国讲话的只有一个政府，即中华人民共和国中央人民政府。
   继即将主席的裁决付诸表决。结果这项裁决以二十六票（土耳其、南非联邦、国民党分子以及其他国家）对十三票（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、英国、印度、挪威、阿根廷、及其他国家）获得通过；十六国代表团弃权（美国、缅甸、叙利亚、及其他国家）。
   维辛斯基继而提出苏联修正案中的新措词。他建议以下面的方式修正叙利亚和伊拉克提案：“安理会常任理事国”这几个字后应加上“包括中华人民共和国在内”字样。维辛斯基强调说，如果这样的修正案获得通过，委员会将仅仅是对谁必须参加会谈这一问题表示意见，而不是对中国在联合国的代表权问题表示意见。
   美国代表杜勒斯反对这项新修正案。他提议宣布此项修正案为“不能接受”。
   美国代表的提议当即付诸表决。三十五国代表团投票赞成这项建议，十二国代表团（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、英国、印度、丹麦等国）则投票反对，十一国代表国（阿根廷、也门、叙利亚、挪威等国）弃权。
   其后，政治委员会即表决伊拉克及叙利亚提案，该提案获得委员会一致通过。
   “保障和平的联合行动”案的讨论至此全部结束。委员会十月二十三日会议将开始讨论苏联所提“制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全宣言”案。
