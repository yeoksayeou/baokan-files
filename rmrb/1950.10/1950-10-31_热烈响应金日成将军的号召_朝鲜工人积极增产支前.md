    Korean Workers Actively Increase Production to Support the Front
    [Xinhua News Agency, 30th] According to TASS: The Korean working class is responding to General Kim Il-sung's call to defend the fatherland and eliminate the aggressors by increasing production and improving labor productivity. At a mobilization meeting at the factory led by Zhou Xibo (transliteration), worker Kim Do-in (transliteration) said passionately: "American aggressors cannot make us kneel. We will shed every last drop of blood to defend our young republic and our freedom and independence. I guarantee to double the production of military supplies to provide for the People's Army." These words have been fully realized. The factory completed its October plan ahead of schedule on the 24th. Workers in other factories and mines have also enthusiastically responded to General Kim Il-sung's call.
