　　Workers, Masters of the Country! Devote All Your Blood and Sweat to the Cause of National Construction!
　　Southwest China Industrial Labor Model Zhang Yulin

　　I am overjoyed to be able to celebrate the first National Day after the founding of the People's Republic with the people of the capital in Beijing today. I am a worker, and in the old society, I had no education. Today, my excitement is beyond words. But I deeply realize that only in the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have we, the working class, been liberated and become masters of the country. Only then could I be elected as a labor hero, come all the way from the Southwest to Beijing to participate in the National Labor Model Representative Conference, and see our great Chairman Mao. This is the most glorious thing I have ever felt in my life!

　　From Kunming to Wuhan to Beijing, we received a warm welcome and hospitality from the people everywhere. Especially Chairman Mao's hospitality moved me deeply and I will never forget it. We, the working class, the masters of the country, must stand firmly at our national construction posts from now on, and devote all our blood and sweat to the cause of national construction. Only in this way can we live up to Chairman Mao's teaching and the love and support of the people throughout the country.

　　At the conference, I saw heroes and models from all over the country and heard about advanced production experiences from various places, which helped me find role models to learn from and goals to strive for.

　　At the conference, I saw so many combat heroes and labor models from all over the country, and I felt truly proud. With these heroes and models in our new China, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the great unity of workers, peasants, soldiers, and people from all walks of life, working together to build our new country, how bright and splendid the future of our country will be!

　　Today, as the whole country rejoices and celebrates National Day, I swear to the people of the country: After I return to the Southwest, I will definitely convey Chairman Mao's instructions to us and the experience I gained at the conference to every worker as much as possible, and resolutely carry out the task of building a new country entrusted to us by Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country. We must give full play to the initiative and creativity of the working class, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao, build the new China into a new country with a strong national defense force and a strong economic power, and strive to completely eliminate the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits, smash the aggression of American imperialism, and liberate Taiwan and Tibet.

　　工人阶级，国家的主人翁们！  把血汗完全流到国家建设事业上去！
    西南区工业劳动模范  张玉林
    今天我能在北京和首都的人民在一起庆祝开国后的第一个国庆节，我真是高兴万分。我是一个工人，过去在旧社会里，没有念过书，今天我的兴奋，是写不出来的。但是我却深刻的认识到：只有在共产党和毛主席领导下的新中国，我们工人阶级翻了身，做了国家的主人，我才能被选为劳动英雄，从大老远的西南来到北京，参加全国劳模代表大会，看见了我们的伟大的毛主席。这是我有生以来感觉到最光荣的一件事！
    从昆明经武汉到北京，我们都加倍的受到了人民的热烈的欢迎和招待。特别是毛主席对我们的招待，真使我感动极了，使我时刻不能忘记。我们工人阶级，国家的主人翁，今后必须坚强的站在国家建设的岗位上，把自己的血汗完全流到国家的建设事业上去，这才不辜负毛主席对我们的教养和全国人民对我们的爱戴。
    在大会上，我看到了各地的英雄模范，听到了各地先进的生产经验，让我找到了学习的榜样和努力的目标。
    在大会上，我看到全国有这样多的战斗英雄和劳动模范，我真感觉到骄傲。我们新中国，有这些英雄和模范们，在共产党和毛主席的领导下，有全国工农兵和各界人士的大团结，齐心努力建设我们的新国家，我们国家发展的前途，该是多么样的光辉灿烂哪！
    在举国腾欢，庆祝国庆节的今天，我向全国人民宣誓：我回到西南以后，我一定把毛主席给我们的指示以及在大会上我所得到的经验，尽力的向每一个工人传达，并坚决的执行毛主席和全国人民交给我们建设新国家的任务。我们一定充分的发挥工人阶级的积极性和创造性，在毛主席的领导下，把新中国建设成为一个有强大国防军、有强大经济力量的新国家，为彻底的消灭国民党残余匪帮，粉碎美帝国主义的侵略，解放台湾和西藏而奋斗。
