Dear Comrade Stalin:

We, in the name of the First National Work Conference of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association of the People's Republic of China, extend to you our most cordial greetings.

With the great assistance you and the Soviet Union under your leadership have continuously given us, we have won independence and democracy and are gradually embarking on the road of economic and cultural construction. The friendship and unity between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly consolidated. Based on this close mutual assistance and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, and the strength of solidarity of all people's democratic countries, we believe that we will certainly be able to stop the provocations of the imperialists and safeguard lasting world peace.

In the future, we are willing to use our greatest strength to improve and expand the movement of the people of the whole country to understand and learn from the Soviet Union, and further strengthen the friendship and unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

We wish you good health and longevity!

Long live the unity and friendship of the Chinese and Soviet peoples!

Long live the Soviet Union, the bulwark of world peace and democracy!

The First Work Conference of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
October 11th
