    Regarding the Reader Mail Column Issue
    Comrade Li Huang:
    Regarding the issue raised in the Northeast Daily's work report for June and July, submitted by the News Administration, concerning whether reader letters should be placed on page three or four, our opinion is as follows:
    Placing reader letters on page three or four is not a critical issue. The News Administration's decision on improving newspaper work only specifies that reader letters should be a major component of general newspaper supplements. It does not stipulate which page they should be placed on. Some articles published in "News Work" magazine only assume, based on general practice, that supplements are on page four. Your question essentially boils down to whether the current reader service column should be merged with the supplement section.
    The News Administration's decision on improving newspaper work advocates using reader letters as the main content of the supplement to address the past tendency of supplements lacking lively and vibrant reflections of mass life, often becoming practice grounds for novice writers. By shifting to reader letters as the main content, and by paying attention to attracting and uncovering lively and rich content from the letters, these shortcomings can be corrected. However, this does not mean eliminating all original content from the supplement. To meet the needs of readers from all walks of life, much of the content in your existing supplement is still necessary. However, you should examine whether the supplement's content is connected to reality and the masses.
    Thus, your reader service column does not have to be merged with the comprehensive supplement and can still be published separately. You are now paying attention to publishing readers' critical letters, which is good. But you should also pay attention to attracting and uncovering other aspects of reader letters (on this point, the article "On Reader Mail Columns and Supplements with Reader Letters as the Main Content" in "News Work" issue 16 has already offered some opinions). This will make the supplement's content richer.

    Regarding the Sovereignty of Tsushima Island
    I. To the Letters Editor:
    In the second paragraph of "Talking About News Maps" in the September 13th "News Work" newspaper review, the conclusion states: "...only the third treatment (referring to placing Tsushima Island outside of Korea) is correct, but its shortcoming is the failure to state that Tsushima Island belongs to Japan."
    We once raised the same question with the "Chinese Worker" Pictorial. According to the reply from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Editorial and Publishing Office, they consulted the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The response was: "Tsushima Island does not belong to Korea, but it does not belong to Japan either. Its sovereignty has not yet been determined." This proves that the previous statement (that Tsushima Island belongs to Japan) is incorrect. Please provide a more detailed answer to this question and we hope that you will correct the statement about Tsushima Island in "News Work."
            Sincerely,
            Qiao Zengjian, Li Wenshu, September 27th
    II. Reply
    The statement in "News Work" regarding the sovereignty of Tsushima Island should be corrected as follows:
    Tsushima Island is located between the southeast end of Korea and the northwest end of Kyushu Island, Japan, about 61 kilometers from Busan Port, Korea, and about 76 kilometers from Iki Island, Japan. It has a population of about 50,000 to 60,000, an area of about 700 square kilometers, and a coastline of about 945 kilometers. The island shape extends from northeast to southwest. The entire island consists of northern Kami-shima and southern Shimo-shima. Both islands are mostly mountainous. Tsushima Island and Korea form the Korea Strait, and Tsushima Island and Iki Island form the Tsushima Strait, controlling the throat of the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea, making it an important transportation and military location.
    Historically, Tsushima Island has had tributary relationships with both China and Korea, but in recent centuries, the island has always belonged to Japan. According to incomplete data, after 813 AD, Tsushima Island was within the sphere of influence of Silla, Korea. From 1192 to 1232, the King of Tsushima, Abiru Min, maintained independence. When the Mongol army attacked Japan in 1274 and 1281, they occupied the island. Thereafter, the island was controlled by Japan for a long period, becoming a Japanese fiefdom. In 1871, during the Meiji Restoration in Japan, feudal domains were abolished and prefectures were established, and Tsushima Island was also made a prefecture. Later, the island prefecture was abolished and merged into Imari Prefecture. Finally, it belonged to Nagasaki Prefecture, divided into Kamiagata and Shimoagata districts, until Japan surrendered. Therefore, Tsushima Island was not Korean territory before World War II, or even before Japan annexed Korea.
    However, the Potsdam Declaration of July 26, 1945, stipulated that "the terms of the Cairo Declaration must be implemented, and Japanese sovereignty must be limited to Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku, and such other minor islands as we determine." Therefore, the final status of Tsushima Island after the war should be decided by the wartime Allied powers of the Soviet Union, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom. In the past five years, due to the US imperialist insistence on solely controlling Japan, hindering the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, the final status of Tsushima Island has been delayed until now and cannot be formally determined.

    Regarding the Correction of the Article "How to Improve the Guidance of News"
    Editor:
    In the article "How to Improve the Guidance of News" that I wrote, published in the September 27th issue of "News Work," the end of the second paragraph of the first section should be corrected as follows: "It shows that poor management is one of the major causes of the difficulties. This uses the experience of private enterprises themselves to point out a path for private enterprises facing difficulties to improve their management and overcome difficulties. Second, it is good at seizing new things and new directions that emerge in the natural development of things and reporting them in a timely manner, using the advanced to promote the backward. For example, immediately reporting when certain private enterprises have made preliminary improvements and achieved certain results also has a certain promotional effect."

    关于读者来信版问题李荒同志：
    新闻总署交来东北日报六七月份工作报告中所提出的关于读者来信应放在第三版或第四版问题，我们的意见如下：
    读者来信放在第三版或第四版不是什么重要的问题。新闻总署关于改进报纸工作的决定，也只说明了读者来信应该作为一般报纸副刊的主要内容，至于放在那一版，并没有作过什么规定。《新闻工作》所发表的一些文章，亦仅系按一般习惯假定副刊在第四版而言，你们的问题实际上只有一个，就是现在的读者服务栏与副刊是否应该合并。
    新闻总署关于改进报纸工作的决定，提倡以读者来信为副刊的主要内容，为的是过去一般副刊往往缺乏生动活泼的反映群众生活的东西，常常变成一部分初学写作者的习作园地，改以读者来信为主要内容，并注意吸引和发掘来信中的生动的丰富的内容，就可以改正那些缺点。但这样作决不是要取消原有副刊中的一切内容。为了适应各方面读者的需要，你们现有副刊中的许多内容，还是必要的。不过应当检查一下副刊内容是否能联系实际与联系群众。
    这样，你们的读者服务栏就可以不和综合性副刊合并，仍然单独刊出。你们现在注意刊载了读者的批评信件，这是好的，但还应该注意吸引和发掘读者来信的其他方面的内容（关于此点，《新闻工作》第十六期《论读者来信版和以读者来信为主要内容的副刊》一文已经提出过一些意见）。这样将使副刊内容更加丰富。

    关于对马岛的主权问题
    一、来信编辑同志：
    在九月十三日《新闻工作》报纸巡礼的第二段中“谈谈新闻地图”的结语中说：“……只有第三种处理（指对马岛列在朝鲜国境外）是正确的，但是它的缺点是没有说明对马岛属于日本。”
    我们曾经向《中国工人》画报提出同一问题，据总工会编辑出版室回信说，他们曾询问外交部亚洲司，对这一问题的答复是：“对马岛不属于朝鲜，但也不属于日本，它的主权尚未确定。”这证明了前一种说法（对马岛属于日本）是不对的。请你们对这一问题作一较详细的答复，并且希望对《新闻工作》关于对马岛问题的说法加以补正。此致敬礼
            乔曾鉴、李文树九月二十七日
    二、答复
    《新闻工作》关于对马岛主权问题的说法应补正如下：
    对马岛位居朝鲜东南端与日本九州岛西北端之间，距朝鲜釜山港约六十一公里，距日本壹岐岛约七十六公里。人口约五、六万，面积约七百平方公里，海岸线约长九百四十五公里。岛形由东北向西南伸延，全岛由北部的上岛及南部的下岛组成，上、下二岛均多山地。对马岛与朝鲜形成朝鲜海峡，与日本壹岐岛形成对马海峡，控日本海与黄海之咽喉，为交通上及军事上要地。
    就历史上来讲，对马岛与中国及朝鲜均有过藩属的关系，但近世数百年来，该岛一直是隶属于日本。据不完全的资料，公元八一三年后，对马岛为朝鲜新罗的势力范围。一一九二年至一二三二年，对马国王阿比留民曾保持独立。一二七四年及一二八一年蒙古军进攻日本时，曾占领该岛。此后，该岛有一较长时期为日本所控制，成为日本的一个藩属。一八七一年日本明治维新，废藩置县，对马岛亦被设县。以后该岛县治撤废，合并于伊万里县。最后又归属长崎县，分为上县郡及下县郡，直至日本投降。因此，对马岛在二次大战以前，甚至在日本吞并朝鲜以前，即不是朝鲜的领土。
    但是，一九四五年七月二十六日的波茨坦公告规定：“开罗宣言之条件必须实施，而日本之主权必须限于本州、北海道、九州、四国及吾人所决定之其他小岛之内。”因此，战后对马岛的最后地位问题，应由苏、中、美、英战时诸盟国来决定。五年来，由于美帝国主义坚持单独管制日本，阻挠全面对日和约的缔结，因而使对马岛的最后地位问题，拖延迄今，无法正式确定。
          （编者）
    关于《如何提高新闻的指导性》一文的修正编者同志：
    九月二十七日《新闻工作》刊载我所写的《如何提高新闻的指导性》一文中第一节第二段末应修正如下：“它说明经营不善是造成困难的重大原因之一，这就用私营企业自身的经验来给遇到困难的私营企业指出了一条改善经营克服困难的道路。其次是善于抓住事物在自然发展中显露出来的新东西新方向及时作报道，用先进的来推动落后的。如在某些私营企业已作初步改善并取得了某些成效时，立即报道，也有一定的推动作用。”
