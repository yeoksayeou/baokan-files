    [Xinhua News Agency, 1st] The celebration rally for the first National Day of the People's Republic of China was held today in the People's Square in front of Tiananmen in Beijing. The celebration rally included a grand parade of the People's Liberation Army's army, air force, navy and various services and arms, and a grand demonstration by people of all strata in the capital. More than 400,000 people participated in today's celebration rally.

    The national emblem of the People's Republic of China and a huge portrait of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, were hung high on Tiananmen. Two large slogans were hung horizontally on the east and west walls of Tiananmen, reading "Long Live the People's Republic of China" and "Long Live the Great Unity of the People of the World". In front of the red walls on the south side of the square, eight red silk banners with the words "National Day" and thirty-two red flags were waving in the wind, and the armed forces to be reviewed stood in front of these red flags.

    Attending today's parade were Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government, Vice Chairmen Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Soong Ching Ling, Li Jishen, Zhang Lan, Secretary General Lin Boqu, Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai, members of the Central People's Government, heads of various commissions, ministries, committees, academies, administrations, and banks, members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and leaders of various democratic parties and people's organizations. Also participating in the ceremony were representatives of delegations of people from various ethnic groups in the border regions who were specially sent to the capital to participate in the celebration ceremony, representatives of overseas Chinese, combat heroes from various troops and militias meeting in Beijing, representatives of labor models from workers, peasants, and soldiers from all over the country, and representatives of the delegation of the World Democratic Youth League visiting China.

    At 11:00 a.m., Lin Boqu, Secretary General of the Central People's Government, announced the start of the celebration rally. In the military music of the national anthem, twenty-eight salutes were fired.

    The rally first held a military parade. Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army reviewed the army, air force, navy, and public security forces. The military parade was commanded by Nie Rongzhen, Acting Chief of the General Staff of the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission. After Commander-in-Chief Zhu reviewed the troops in a review car, he read the order of the headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to the armed forces and militias throughout the country (full text to be issued separately), followed by the divisional parade of the armed forces. Troops of various services and arms marched past the rostrum from east to west, lasting one hour and twenty minutes. The reviewed troops were led by students from air force schools and naval schools, followed by infantry, artillery, motorized infantry, and cavalry units. As the infantry marched, formations of various types of aircraft from the air force flew over the venue from east to west. The neat and orderly formations of the various services and arms gave the people attending the ceremony great excitement, and applause from the reviewing stand and the grandstands resounded through the sky again and again.

    The enthusiastic demonstration ranks of people from all strata in the capital then successively poured into the venue. At the forefront of the ranks were the Young Pioneers. These fifteen thousand boys and girls were wearing uniform white tops with red scarves tied around their necks. As they approached the reviewing stand, they immediately raised their hands and jumped and cheered towards the great people's leader Chairman Mao. They waved flowers, colored flags, or pine branches, with colorful splashes, making the venue full of youthful vitality. Following them were 60,000 industrial workers from large factories, 40,000 farmers from the suburbs, 3,000 Hui people, 60,000 government employees, 75,000 students from secondary and higher schools, and more than 100,000 organized workers, shop assistants, and other citizens.

The demonstration teams shouted slogans such as "Long Live Chairman Mao", "Long Live Stalin", "Liberate Taiwan and Tibet", "Oppose US Imperialist Aggression against Taiwan and Korea", "People of All Asia Unite", and "People of the Whole World Unite".
