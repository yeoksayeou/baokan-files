　　At the Consultative Conference on the Reorganization of the Chinese Red Cross Society
    Hu Lansheng, Li Dequan, and Wu Yunfu Give Reports
    [This newspaper's report] The Chinese Red Cross Society Headquarters convened a consultative conference on August 2nd and 3rd of this year, organized by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government and the Chinese People's Relief Association, inviting representatives from relevant groups and organizations to carry out the reorganization. At this consultative conference, in addition to formulating new articles of association and organizing a new board of directors, it also heard a report from Hu Lansheng, Secretary-General of the original Chinese Red Cross Society, on the review of the society's work; a report from Li Dequan, Minister of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, on the future work guidelines of the Red Cross Society; and a report from Wu Yunfu, Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Relief Association, on adjusting certain principles of the Chinese Red Cross Society.
    In his review report on the work of the Chinese Red Cross Society at the Consultative Conference on the Reorganization of the Chinese Red Cross Society, Hu Lansheng, Secretary-General of the Chinese Red Cross Society, stated: First of all, what we should review is the issue of thought and perspective. In the past, we often emphasized that the Red Cross Society is an international organization, a charitable undertaking, and that it "loves" all of humanity equally, regardless of enemy or friend, regardless of class. Internationally, it advertised "neutrality," and domestically, it advertised "detachment." These thoughts and perspectives are absolutely wrong. The Chinese Red Cross Society is an organization of the Chinese people. It only has international relations and is not a branch of an international organization. It only has one position, which is the position of the people. It has neither neutrality nor can it be detached. The "love" ideology of not distinguishing between enemy and friend, or between classes, is propaganda by capitalists to deceive the people. Now we must re-establish new thoughts and service perspectives, go deep into the masses, face the workers and peasants, serve the interests of the working people wholeheartedly, and rely on the masses to mobilize and organize them to eliminate diseases and disasters, and heal the wounds left by the war. Secondly, in the past, because the Red Cross Society was regarded as a passive charitable undertaking, its work was often passive, perfunctory, and left to develop naturally, without clear goals and practical plans. This was certainly related to the political environment of the past, but our subjective lack of a clear attitude of being responsible for the interests of the people is also an important reason. In the future, we must not only establish a firm attitude of serving the people, but also formulate practical work plans and proceed with emphasis and in a step-by-step manner. Finally, what should be reviewed is that the past organization completely detached itself from the people at a certain period. Due to the reactionary government's management and supervision of the Red Cross Society, our Chinese Red Cross Society, although nominally a people's organization, actually had no mass base. Especially after the War of Resistance Against Japan, the upper-level leadership structure was entirely controlled by the Kuomintang government. Members could not express any opinions to the Red Cross Society, and personnel changes in the leadership could not be decided based on mass opinions and work needs. As a result, people who did not want to manage affairs became directors, and people who wanted to manage affairs were suppressed and could not come forward. Thus, the entire organization dragged on and became slack. In the future, if we want to develop new undertakings on the existing foundation, we must strengthen the membership organization, establish a mass base, and make the Chinese Red Cross Society truly a Red Cross Society of the people, so that we can rely on the strength of the masses to develop the society's work. At the same time, we must also contribute to the international Red Cross organization, so that Red Cross societies around the world can truly uphold world peace and promote the spirit of mutual assistance and friendship between nations, rather than being exploited by imperialism.
    Li Dequan, Minister of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, stated in her report on the future work guidelines of the Chinese Red Cross Society at the meeting: At present, China has very few health facilities, not enough health cadres, and diseases and disasters seriously threaten the health of the people, especially the workers and peasants. Health work is a mass work, and the masses must be widely organized and relied upon. Developing the Red Cross Society is a way to organize the masses to fight against diseases and disasters. The Soviet Red Cross Society and the "Red Crescent Union" have become universal organizations of the working masses. They have not only assisted the health departments in carrying out health publicity and education work, but also played a huge role in the elimination of infectious diseases in the Soviet Union over the past thirty years, in ensuring the health of the people, and in the rescue and medical work during the Soviet Patriotic War. In 1926, the Soviet Red Cross Society had 75,000 members; in 1934, it had 5 million members; during the Patriotic War, it had 12 million members; in 1945, it increased by 500,000 members every quarter, and in July of the same year, the number of branches had increased to 200,000. The Chinese Red Cross Society, based on the real needs of the people, must follow the Soviet path, cooperate with the people's government to promote the guidelines and plans of health work, change the current situation of disease prevalence in China, and gradually realize Article 48 of the Common Program: "Promote national sports, promote health and medical undertakings, and pay attention to protecting the health of mothers, infants, and children." Therefore, the new Chinese Red Cross Society's guidelines should be, under the leadership of the People's Government, and based on the general policy of health work of "prevention first" and the relief and welfare policy of "mobilizing and organizing the people to practice self-help and help others," assist people's governments at all levels in facing the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and promote publicity, epidemic prevention, health, and relief and welfare undertakings.
    Wu Yunfu, Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Relief Association, in his report on adjusting relevant issues of the Chinese Red Cross Society, believed that the adjustment steps of the Red Cross Society should first reorganize the original organization, train cadres, educate members, and establish a people's perspective; start with branches with a relatively solid foundation, and then gradually popularize them; first engage in medical and health work, and then carry out other social relief and welfare work.

　　在改组中国红十字会协商会议上
    胡兰生李德全伍云甫作报告
    【本报讯】中国红十字会总会于本年八月二、三两日由中央人民政府卫生部及中国人民救济总会邀集有关团体机关的代表，举行协商会议，进行改组。该次协商会议除制定了新的会章，组织了新的理事会外，并听取了原中国红十字会总会胡兰生秘书长关于会务检讨的报告，中央人民政府卫生部李德全部长关于红十字会今后工作方针的报告，以及中国人民救济总会伍云甫秘书长关于调整中国红十字会若干原则问题的报告。
    中国红十字会秘书长胡兰生在改组中国红十字会协商会议上，关于中国红十字会会务的检讨报告中称：首先我们应该检讨的是思想和观点问题。过去我们常强调红十字会是国际性的团体，是慈善事业，对于人类不分敌我，不分阶级，一律“博爱”。在国际上标榜着“中立”，在国内标榜着“超然”。这些思想和观点，是绝对错误的。中国红十字会是中国人民的组织，它只有国际关系而并非国际组织的支体，它只有一个立场，即是人民的立场，既没有中立，也不能超然。不分敌我，不分阶级的“博爱”思想是资本主义者欺骗人民的宣传。现在我们要重新建立新的思想和服务观点，要深入群众，面向工农、全心全意地为劳动人民的利益服务，并依靠群众发动和组织他们消灭疾病和灾难，医治战争所遗留的创伤。其次，过去因为把红十字会看作是一个消极性的慈善事业，所以在工作上常是被动的，应付的，任其自然发展的，没有明确的目标和切实的计划。这固然与过去的政治环境有连带的关系，但我们主观上对人民利益负责的态度不明确，亦是重要原因。今后我们必须一面确立坚定的为人民服务的态度，一面制定切实的工作计划，有重点有步骤地进行。最后应该检讨的，是过去的组织在某一时期中完全脱离了人民。由于反动政府对红十字会的管理和监督，使我们中国红十字会虽名为人民团体，实际上并无群众基础。尤其是抗日战争以后，上层领导机构全由国民党政府控制，会员对红十字会无法表示一点意见，领导方面人事的调动，亦不能根据群众意见和工作的需要来决定，所以不理事的人当了理事，想理事的人反而受了压制不能出头理事，以致整个组织就这样拖踏松懈了下去。今后我们要在旧有基础上开展新事业，必须加强会员组织，建立群众基础，使中国红十字会真正的成为人民的红十字会，才能依靠群众的力量来发展会务。同时在国际红十字会组织方面也必须贡献力量，使全世界红十字会都能真正做到拥护世界和平、发扬国际间互助友爱的精神而不为帝国主义所利用。
    中央人民政府卫生部李德全部长在会议上所作关于中国红十字会今后工作方针的报告中称：目前中国的一切卫生设施很少，卫生干部不够，疾病和灾难严重地威胁着人民的健康，特别是工农群众。卫生工作是一种群众性工作，必须广泛地组织群众并且依靠群众。发展红十字会便是组织群众向疾病和灾难斗争的一种方式。苏联红十字会及“红新月联合会”，已经成为劳动群众的普遍组织，它不仅协助卫生部门进行了卫生宣传教育工作，而且三十年来，对于苏联传染病的消灭，对保证人民健康以及苏联卫国战争时期的救护医疗工作，都起了极大的作用。苏联红十字会在一九二六年有会员七万五千人，一九三四年为五百万人，卫国战争时期有会员一千二百万人，一九四五年每季增加五十万人，同年七月统计分支会已增至二十万个。中国红十字会根据人民的现实需要，必须走苏联的道路，配合人民政府推行卫生工作的方针计划，改变中国目前疾病流行的情况，逐步实现共同纲领第四十八条：“提倡国民体育，推广卫生医药事业，并注意保护母亲、婴儿和儿童的健康”的任务。因此新的中国红十字会的方针应该是在人民政府领导下，根据“预防为主”的卫生工作总方针及“动员和组织人民实行自救助人”的救济福利方针，协助各级人民政府面向工农兵群众，推广宣传、防疫、卫生及救济福利事业。
    中国人民救济总会秘书长伍云甫在调整中国红十字会有关问题的报告中，认为：红十字会调整步骤，应先整理原有组织，训练干部，教育会员，建立人民观点；先从较有基础的分会做起，而后逐渐普及；先搞医疗卫生，而后做其他社会救济福利工作。
