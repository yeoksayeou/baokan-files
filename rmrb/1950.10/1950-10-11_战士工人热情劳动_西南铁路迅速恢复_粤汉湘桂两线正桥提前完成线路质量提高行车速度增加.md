　　Soldiers and Workers Work Enthusiastically
    Southwest Railway Quickly Restored
    Yuehan and Xianggui Main Bridges Completed Ahead of Schedule; Line Quality Improved; Train Speed Increased

    [Report from this newspaper] The Southwest Railway has been rapidly restored in the past year, achieving significant results. When the People's Republic of China was founded last October, the Hengyang Railway Administration had only 118 kilometers of operating track. At that time, Hengyang, Guangzhou, and Liuzhou had not yet been liberated. When the enemies retreated from the above-mentioned areas, they systematically destroyed the railway. Bridges alone were destroyed in 86 locations, with a total length of 5,531 meters. Among them were the Xiaoxi and Zhanghe bridges, towering at 30-40 meters; the magnificent Yanxia arch bridge; and the Pupu River, Miluo River, and Lei River bridges, each extending 400 meters. After the enemy's destruction, the bridge piers were cracked and collapsed, and the steel beams were scattered and crisscrossed, causing the Yuehan and Xianggui lines to be cut off section by section and riddled with holes. Seeing the devastated state of the destroyed roads, railway workers and commanders and fighters of the Railway Corps ignited a fire of anger and mustered a high degree of labor enthusiasm. In eight and a half days, they repaired and opened the 363-meter-long Lei River temporary bridge, creating an astonishing record of driving 80 piles per day with machinery. Twenty-six people once made sixteen bents in one day, exceeding the normal efficiency by more than five times. Bridge builders erected the majestic 33-meter-high steel tower on the Zhang Bridge River in two and a half days, and safely erected an 80-ton, 30-meter plate girder on the narrow steel tower 36 meters above the ground. This 39-meter-high bridge was successfully repaired and opened to traffic in just over a month. The Xiangjiang Bridge (semi-permanent), which connects the Yuehan and Xianggui lines, was not repaired by the Kuomintang reactionaries for four years after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. We completed the repairs in just over a month of formal work. Jiangnan has a lot of rain and early spring floods, and there are 64 large and small wooden temporary bridges on the entire line. In order to avoid the serious threat of floods, from January to April this year, the main bridge restoration projects of important bridges such as Puqi, Xinqiang, Miluo, Lukou, Mi River, Lei River, Pa River, Lu River, Li River, and Daxi River were successfully completed, one month ahead of schedule. In total, 60 bridges have been improved in the past year, with a total length of 1,699 meters. Among them, the 591-meter-long Liujiang Bridge, the second largest bridge in Jiangnan, was not repaired by the Kuomintang reactionaries after three years of preparation. However, the liberated Chinese workers repaired the piers and built the bridge in less than seven months. Under extremely difficult construction conditions, the workers adopted advanced Soviet experience and erected three 49-meter-long flower girder spans, which was the first time in China. Under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the lines had been in disrepair for many years and the track was extremely bad. The speed of the Yuehan main line was only 30-40 kilometers per hour, and the Xianggui line was 15-20 kilometers per hour, and accidents occurred frequently. In the past year, employees have gradually promoted the new road maintenance method on the entire Yuehan line; track consolidation has been carried out on the entire Xianggui line. As of the end of September, 508 kilometers of medium repairs and 640 kilometers of minor repairs had been completed, and 44 kilometers of track consolidation had been completed. A total of 1.1 million sleepers were replaced, and 650,000 cubic meters of ballast were added. The entire Yuehan line is expected to be completely rehabilitated by the end of November, and the driving speed in most sections may be increased to 50-60 kilometers. The Xianggui line may be increased to 30 kilometers.
    Although the Southwest Railway construction has achieved such results, there are still many shortcomings. For example, being eager to complete tasks, the quality was quite universally neglected, and there is still a considerable serious waste in the work, which should be corrected and always paid attention to in the construction of the Southwest People's Railway.

    西南铁路迅速恢复
    粤汉湘桂两线正桥提前完线路质量提高行车速度增加
    【本报讯】一年来西南铁路迅速恢复，获得重大成绩。去年十月中华人民共和国成立时，衡阳铁路管理局通车地段只一一八公里。当时衡阳、广州、柳州尚未解放。上述各地敌人败退时，曾经有计划地破坏铁路。仅桥梁即被破坏八六座，总延长五五三一米。其中有高达三○——四○公尺的小溪、樟河二桥；有工程宏伟的岩下大拱桥；有长达四○○米的蒲河、汩罗江及耒河等桥。敌人破坏后，各桥墩座崩裂塌陷，钢梁狼籍纵横，致粤汉、湘桂两线，节节斩断，百孔千疮。铁路职工与铁道兵团指战员看到各路被破坏的残破惨状，燃起愤怒之火，鼓起高度劳动热情，以八天半的时间，把长达三六三公尺的耒河便桥修好通车，创造了机器每天打桩达八十根的惊人纪录。二十六个人一天曾做十六个排架，超过平常效率五倍以上。修桥者以二天半的时间，竖起樟桥河上高达三三公尺的雄伟钢塔，在离地三六公尺高的狭窄钢塔上，安全地架起重八十吨的三十公尺钣梁。这座三九米高的高桥，仅一个多月就胜利修复通车了。联结粤汉、湘桂两线的湘江大桥（半永久式），在抗战胜利后，国民党反动派四年未修起，我们正式工作不过一个多月就修通了。江南多雨，春汛早临，全线又有大小六四座木便桥。为避免洪水的严重威胁，在今年一至四月，又胜利完成蒲圻、新墙、汩罗、渌口、洣河、耒河、潖江、渌江、漓江、大溪河……等重要桥梁的正桥复旧工程，比预定期限提前一月。总计一年来共改善桥梁六○座，总延长一六九九公尺，其中五九一米长的江南第二大桥——柳江桥是国民党反动派筹备三年未能修好的。但解放后的中国工人，以不到七个月的时间，就修好墩座，架好桥梁。在施工异常困难的情形下，工人们接受了苏联的先进经验，架好了四九米的三孔花梁三孔，这在中国还是第一次。在国民党反动统治下，各线年久失修，线路极坏。粤汉正线每小时速度仅三○——四○公里，湘桂线一五——二○公里，事故不断发生。一年来员工们逐步在粤汉全线推行了新养路法；在湘桂全线进行了轨道整理。截至九月底止，已完成中修五○八公里，经修六四○公里，轨道整理四四公里。共抽换枕木一一○万根，添铺道碴六五万立公方，粤汉全线十一月底可望全部翻身，多数地段的行车速度可能提高至五○——六○公里。湘桂线可能提高至三○公里。
    西南铁路建设虽获得这样成绩，但仍有不少缺点。比如急于完成任务，相当普遍地忽视了质量，和工作中仍存在着相当严重的浪费现象等，是应在建设西南人民铁路中加以纠正并时刻注意的。（石拓）
