　　Model Soldier Zhang Shuyi Sends Letter to This Newspaper
    Expressing Thoughts on Attending the Model Worker Conference
    [This Newspaper]河北省 (Hebei Province) Model Soldier and correspondent for this newspaper, Zhang Shuyi, after returning to his village from attending the National Congress of Labor Models, sent a letter to this newspaper expressing his thoughts. The original text is as follows:
    To the editors of the People's Daily:
    After attending the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers this time, I have a lot to say, but I don't know how to write, so I asked a comrade to write as I dictated.
    This time when I went to Beijing, everyone took care of us very thoughtfully. The heads of the districts sent us to the province, and the province sent us to Beijing. When I saw Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, I was so happy that I didn't know what to say. The leaders really cared about us, checking on us several times a day. The government also gave me a pair of legs. Many people gave us flowers. The reception comrades also took care of us at all times, which was extremely kind.
    I am very happy in my heart, but I also feel ashamed that my ability is not strong and I have no special skills. I hope everyone will help me, and I will definitely work hard to improve my personal production, and at the same time lead the masses in the village to improve production, and also help the government train labor models, so that our new China can be built faster.
    On National Day, when Chairman Mao reviewed the troops, I saw our people's powerful army, navy, and air force, and my confidence grew even greater. We must do a good job in the rear to support the front-line troops in liberating Taiwan and Tibet, and drive the aggressive forces of American imperialism out of China!
    When I came back, I also brought a lot of newspapers, and I will definitely study hard with the folks. With best regards!
        Zhang Shuyi

　　荣军模范张树义致函本报
    发表参加劳模会议感想
    【本报讯】河北省荣军模范、本报通讯员张树义，在参加了全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议回村后，顷致函本报，发表感想，原文如下：人民日报编辑同志：
    我这次参加了全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议以后，有很多话要说，可是我不会写，就请了一位同志，我念他写。
    我这次到北京，大家对我们照顾得很周到。分区首长把我们送到了省，省又送到了北京。当我看到了毛主席和朱总司令后，我高兴的不知说什么好。首长们对我们真关心，一天看好几回。政府还给我配了一付腿。很多人给我们献花。招待员同志又在时时刻刻地照护着，真是亲热极了。
    我心里很是高兴，但也觉得惭愧，自己能力不强，没有什么本事。我希望大家都帮助我，一定努力工作，把个人生产搞好，同时也领导村中群众把生产搞好，并要帮助政府培养劳动模范，使咱们新中国建设得更快。
    国庆日，毛主席检阅时，我看到了咱们人民强大的陆军、海军和空军，我的信心更大了。我们一定把后方生产搞好，支援前方军队解放台湾和西藏，把美帝国主义的侵略势力赶出中国去！
    我回来时还带了很多报纸，一定和老乡们一块好好学习。此致敬礼！
        张树义
