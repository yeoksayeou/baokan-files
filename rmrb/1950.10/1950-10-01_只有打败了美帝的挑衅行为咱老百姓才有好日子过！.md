　　Only by defeating the provocative acts of American imperialism can our common people have a good life!
    Northwest Agricultural Labor Model Representatives Liu Yuhou, Wang Debiao
    Northwest Labor Model Representative Liu Yuhou said happily: "In the few days before the National Day, we saw Chairman Mao again, which is really delightful. In the past, we ate chaff and wild herbs, and it was rare to even eat sorghum, life was really hard! Now life is so good, we eat only good things, and they repeatedly want me to represent everyone in Beijing to attend meetings, thinking about it, isn't it all thanks to Chairman Mao's good leadership! After I go back this time, I will definitely learn more humbly from everyone. We in the Guanzhong area will carry out land reform this winter, and we will have to fight the landlords fiercely, suppress their arrogance, and let our peasants have a thorough transformation." At this point, Liu Yuhou suddenly widened his eyes and slapped his thigh heavily, saying: "Right now, the life of our common people is not bad! However, American imperialism wants to invade our Chinese land again, not allowing our common people to live a good life, let American imperialism come and see, we will not spare it! At the front lines of our China, there are thousands upon thousands of combat heroes, and at the rear, there are countless labor models who work hard to produce and support the front lines. American imperialism still wants to take risks, it is really courting death! As long as our four hundred and seventy-five million Chinese people are united as one, our common people's good life will not be snatched away by American imperialism!" At this time, labor model Wang Debiao sat beside him nodding with a smile, without saying a word, in this excited atmosphere, he finally opened his mouth, he calmly said: "On National Day, let American imperialism see the strength of our Chinese people!" He took a deep breath and said again: "The burden on our shoulders is very heavy, but we know how to lead the peasants to work hard in production. Only by defeating the provocative acts of American imperialism can our common people have a good life. Thank you to the representatives of labor models from all over the country who participated in this meeting for their valuable experience, and thank you to the leading comrades who warmly saw us off and welcomed us along the way. We will bring everything we gained from this conference back and let everyone know the strength of the new Chinese people."

　　只有打败了美帝的挑衅行为咱老百姓才有好日子过！
    西北农业劳模代表  刘玉厚、王德彪
    西北劳动模范代表刘玉厚欣喜地说：“在国庆的前几天，咱又见到了毛主席，真是高兴。过去，咱吃糠咽菜，连高粱米也难得吃到，日子真难过！现在生活可好啦，尽吃好的，又一次次要我代表大伙到北京来参加会议，想想还不是毛主席领导得好呵！咱这次回去以后，一定更加虚心的向大伙学习。咱关中地方今冬要搞土地改革，咱还得与地主狠狠地打一仗，把地主的气焰打下去，让咱农民来一个彻底大翻身。”这时，刘玉厚忽然睁大了眼睛，重重地拍了一下大腿说：“眼下咱老百姓的日子是过得不错啦！但是，美帝国主义又想来侵略咱中国的土地，不让咱老百姓过好日子，让美帝国主义来看看吧，咱们是不会饶它的！咱中国的前方有着千千万万的战斗英雄，后方有数不尽的努力生产、支援前线的劳动模范。美帝国主义还想来冒险，真是自己找死！只要咱中国四万七千五百万人民团结得像一个人，咱老百姓的好日子就不会被美帝国主义抢去！”这时，劳动模范王德彪坐在旁边笑咪咪地直点头，不言语，在这激奋的气氛中，他终于开口了，他镇静地说：“国庆那天，让美帝国主义来看看咱中国人民的力量吧！”他深深地呼吸了一下又说：“咱肩上的担子是很重的，但是，咱懂得应当怎样领导农民努力生产。只有打败了美帝国主义的挑衅行为，咱老百姓才有好日子过。谢谢参加这次会议的各地劳动模范代表们的宝贵经验，谢谢这次沿途热烈欢送、欢迎我们的首长同志们。咱要把这次大会得到的东西全部带回去，让大伙也知道新中国人民力量的强大。”
