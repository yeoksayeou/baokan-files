Beware of the American-Chiang Kai-shek Special Agent Conspiracy!
	A Corner of the National Public Security Work Exhibition
	Zhang Shikai
　　In the Palace Museum, concurrently with the exhibition of the achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government held a National Public Security Work Exhibition. Upon entering the exhibition hall, the first thing that strikes the eye is a series of conspiratorial activities of special agents and spies jointly carried out by American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits on Chinese soil. In the corridor at the entrance of the exhibition hall, there are several gloomy and bloody photographs, which are the Sino-American Special Technical Cooperation Organization, a den of devils that once massacred countless revolutionary youths and patriotic people. Here, the bodies of the revolutionaries who were murdered are exposed in a chaotic manner. The various handcuffs, shackles, and electric torture equipment used to wield power in the devil's den are all marked with the words "Made in America." When the audience saw this tragic situation, they couldn't help but utter infinite angry condemnation.
　　In a cabinet, there are many strange-shaped weapons of assassination and sabotage. Here are silent pistols, cane pistols, pen pistols, horseshoe boxes, pencil pistols, and various poisons and explosives. These are all made in the United States.
　　In order to murder the Chinese people, American imperialism also trained a large number of special agents for the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Among these photos is one of the American special agent leader, Miles, personally going to the airport to "greet" the special agents sent by the Kuomintang for training. More than a dozen other photos show the fascist and vicious techniques of American imperialism in training Kuomintang special agents. They taught the Kuomintang special agents how to reconnaissance, search, track, and murder, and they coached the Kuomintang special agents on how to experiment with radio control and distinguish between blood and hair.
　　In addition to helping the Kuomintang bandit gang train special agents to harm the Chinese people, American imperialism also directly sent spies to endanger the Chinese people.
　　The Shang Jianxun spy case in Zhangzhuang, Xian County, Hebei, which was cracked in 1947, is one of the spy activities directly directed by American imperialism. Shang Jianxun (French) was the deputy pastor of the Zhangzhuang Catholic Church. Under the instigation of American imperialism, he secretly set up a radio station to detect the military, political, and economic situation in our liberated areas and supply it to the American intelligence agencies stationed in Tianjin and Beijing at that time. In 1946, the criminal colluded with Sun Lianzhong and assisted him in attacking our liberated areas. A photo shows the letter in which Sun Lianzhong promised to send troops. After Shang Jianxun was cracked by our people's government in November 1947, a variety of radio stations and reactionary documents given to him by American imperialism were seized. During the interrogation, Shang Jianxun confessed to his crimes of carrying out espionage activities for American imperialism. These photos fully prove that American imperialism has long been the deadly enemy of the Chinese people.
　　The pictures of the American spy Xiong Xianli case, which was cracked by our people's public security organs last year, provided another batch of ironclad evidence. In November 1945, Xiong Xianli joined the American spy group in Beiping through the introduction of the American spy Freeman, established an intelligence organization for American imperialism, and collected various intelligence about China and the Soviet Union. The photos show a number of sophisticated radio stations, telecommunications equipment, and pistols provided by American imperialism. During the period of his activities, the "Intelligence Liaison Office of the Office of the American Military and Political Minister, Beiping Branch" issued two certificates, one of which stated: "Mr. Xiong Xianli is an employee of the Intelligence Liaison Office of the American Military and Political Minister, Beiping Branch, and is responsible for handling affairs on behalf of this office. Any assistance given to Mr. Xiong is also assistance given to this office, which is expected and appreciated by this office." Before the liberation of Beiping, Maz, the liaison officer of the Shanghai headquarters of the American intelligence office (an American), in order to strengthen its sabotage work against the Chinese people, specially ordered Xiong Xianli to set up the radio station in a reliable location after the liberation of Beiping. After the liberation of Beiping, Xiong Xianli took over the Kuomintang Beiping General Branch and established a relay radio station in his home, responsible for the collection and transfer of intelligence from Shanghai, Changchun, Qingdao, and other places. Although Xiong Xianli was extremely sinister and cunning, he was finally cracked by us. Another set of pictures shows the case of Sasaki Hirotsune, an American spy in Shenyang. Sasaki Hirotsune (Japanese-American), before the liberation of Shenyang in Northeast China, carried out espionage activities under the direct command of the American spy agency "Army Liaison Group" and the former American Consulate in Shenyang, collecting various intelligence about Northeast China and Inner Mongolia. After the liberation of Shenyang in 1948, the criminal, under the order of the American Consulate and the Army Liaison Group, went underground, set up a secret radio station, and led the American T.S. spy group organization to continue to carry out sabotage activities. After being cracked by our people's public security organs last November, a large number of evidence was seized. As can be seen in the photos alone: two American-style latent radio stations, a hand-cranked generator, ten code books, and letters from the American spy Nishida to Sasaki, as well as ID cards specially issued by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.
　　Among these photos is also the case of the White Russian Yelodov spy hired by Mark Narn, the former American Deputy Consul in Dihua, in 1948. One photo shows Mark Narn's fourteen missions for Yelodov to scout in Ashan. One photo shows Yelodov's confession, in which Yelodov confessed Mark Narn's anti-communist and anti-Soviet conspiracy activities in Xinjiang.
　　The above facts show how viciously American imperialism is undermining the cause of the Chinese people, and we must be highly vigilant. But as long as the broad masses of the people and the people's public security organs work together, we will surely achieve continuous victories until we completely crush the aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism.

### 警惕美蒋特务阴谋活动！  记全国公安工作展览会的一角

　　警惕美蒋特务阴谋活动！
    记全国公安工作展览会的一角
    张世楷
    在故宫博物馆里，与中国人民解放军战绩展览的同时，中央人民政府公安部举办了全国公安工作展览会。一进这个展览室，首先使人感到刺目的，就是美帝国主义和蒋匪合流在中国土地上所进行的一连串特务间谍的阴谋活动。在展览室入口处的走廊上，挂着几幅阴森森而带有血腥气味的照片，这就是曾经屠杀了无数革命青年和爱国志士的大魔窟——中美特种技术合作所。在这里杂乱地暴露着被戕害的革命者的尸体。在魔窟施展淫威的各种手铐脚镣、电刑器材，无一样不是印着“美国制”的字样。观众们看见这种惨状，都情不自禁地发出无限愤怒的叱责声。
    在一个柜橱中陈列着许多奇形怪状的暗杀和破坏的武器。这里有无声手枪、手杖手枪、钢笔手枪、马蹄盒子、铅笔手枪以及各种毒药与爆炸药品。这些都是美国制造的。
    为了谋害中国人民，美帝还给蒋匪训练了大批特务。这些照片中有一幅美国特务头子梅乐斯，亲到机场“迎接”国民党派去受训的特务。另外十多幅照片，则是美帝训练国民党特务的法西斯的毒恶技俩。他们教训着国民党特务如何侦察、搜查、跟踪、谋杀，他们教练着国民党特务如何实验无线电的控制以及实验血液、毛发的区别等。
    美帝国主义除了帮助国民党匪帮训练特务残害中国人民之外，还直接派遣间谍来危害中国人民。
    一九四七年破获的河北献县张庄尚建勋间谍案，就是受美帝直接指挥的间谍活动案件之一。尚建勋（法籍）是张庄天主堂的副主教，受美帝指使密设电台，刺探我解放区的军事、政治、经济情况，供给当时留驻平津的美特情报机关。一九四六年该犯更与孙匪连仲相勾结，协助其进攻我解放区。有一张照片印出了孙匪答应派兵的函件。一九四七年十一月尚建勋为我人民政府破获后，搜查出美帝给他的电台与反动证件多种。在审讯中，尚建勋对于他替美帝进行间谍活动的罪恶供认不讳。这些照片充分证明了美帝国主义很久以来就是中国人民的死敌。
    去年为我人民公安机关破获的美帝间谍熊先立案件的图片，又提供了一批铁的证据。熊匪于一九四五年十一月经美帝间谍飞利曼的介绍，在北平加入了美帝间谍组，给美帝建立起情报组织，搜集我国及苏联的各种情报。照片上印着美帝所给予的精制电台、电讯器材及手枪等多件。熊匪在进行活动期间，美国军政部长补助室“情报联络处驻平分处”曾发给以证明文件二纸，其中一纸写道：“熊先立君为美军情报联络处驻平分处之职员，负责代本处办理事务，如有机关予熊君之援助，亦即予本处之援助，该项援助为本处之期待及感佩。”北平解放前，美帝情报处上海总部联络官马兹（美人）为加强其对中国人民的破坏工作，特电令熊匪在北平解放后将电台分设于可靠地点。北平解放后，熊匪即接办了匪特北平总支部，并在他的家里建立了中继电台，负责上海、长春、青岛等地的情报收转工作。熊匪虽极阴险狡诈，但终于被我破获。在另一组图片中展示了沈阳美国间谍佐佐木弘经案。佐佐木弘经（美籍日人），在东北沈阳解放之前，就在美国间谍机关“陆军联络团”及美国前驻沈阳领事馆的直接指挥下进行间谍活动，搜集我东北和内蒙的各种情报。一九四八年沈阳解放后，该犯奉美国领事馆及陆军联络团的命令，潜伏地下，设立秘密电台，并领导美帝Ｔ·Ｓ间谍组组织，继续进行破坏活动。去年十一月为我人民公安机关破获后，搜出了大批的证据。单在照片上就可以看到：两部美式潜伏电台、一部手摇发电机、十本密电码和美帝间谍西田给佐佐木的信件以及蒋匪特别发给的身份证等。
    在这些照片中，还有一九四八年为迪化前美国副领事马克楠所招雇的白俄耶洛多夫间谍案件。一张照片印着马克楠给耶洛多夫去阿山侦察的十四条任务。一张照片印着耶洛多夫的供词，耶洛多夫供出马克楠在新疆布置的反共反苏的阴谋活动。
    以上这些事实，说明了美帝国主义是如何凶恶地破坏着中国人民的事业，我们必须严加警惕。但只要我们广大人民与人民公安机关共同努力，我们就一定能够取得继续不断的胜利，直到彻底粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋为止。
