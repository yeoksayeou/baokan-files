　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, factories in Beijing that manufacture dangerous products such as explosives, flammables, and poisonous or foul-smelling substances are being relocated to designated areas in accordance with the law, to ensure the safety of the capital's people, their property, and cultural relics. To ensure the careful execution of this task, the Municipal Bureau of Industry, the Public Security Bureau, the Bureau of Construction, and the Urban Planning Commission have formed a Factory Relocation Committee to guide and supervise the factories in handling relocation matters. The Bureau of Industry is also assisting the factories in consulting with the Suburban Work Committee, the Bureau of Civil Affairs, and the district government of the southern suburbs to resolve issues such as land and housing. Since the Municipal Government issued a notice at the beginning of last month setting a deadline for relocation, the factories, after explanations from the Bureau of Industry, have recognized the necessity of relocation and are seeking to resolve difficulties and proceed with the move. As of now, the Beijing Oxygen Manufacturing Factory has already found a new site and is building a factory there. The following have found suitable sites that have been inspected and approved by the Municipal Government and are about to begin construction: Danhua, Housheng, Yanbin, and Baoguang match factories, as well as Xinzhongguo, Juyuan, and Lifeng chemical factories, and Jiulongzhai, Shuncheng Heji, and other firecracker workshops. More than ten other units are currently looking for new sites. In addition, many small factories with limited funds are jointly establishing new factories.
　　To take care of the factories' revenues, which would be affected by production stoppages before the completion of the relocation, the Municipal People's Government, after studying and analyzing the nature of each factory's products, has adopted various different approaches. For example, match factories that have decided to relocate are allowed to continue production temporarily at their original sites, but they must strengthen safety equipment to ensure that no accidents occur. If the government inspection finds that there is a potential for danger, it will immediately order a halt to production. Xinzhongguo Chemical Factory is allowed to continue manufacturing silver nitrate before relocation, but the flammable ether and acetone are prohibited from continued production at the original site.

　　京市制造危险产品工厂分别迁移
    各有关机关组织迁移委员会督导办理
    【京市新闻处讯】京市制造爆炸、易燃、毒臭等危险产品的工厂，在市人民政府领导下，为确保首都人民生命财产和文物建筑的安全，正遵照法令纷纷向指定地区进行迁移。市工业局、公安局、建设局和都市计划委员会为慎重做好这一工作，特组成工厂迁移委员会，指导、督促各厂办理迁移事项。工业局并协助各厂向郊区工作委员会、民政局和南郊的区政府洽商解决土地与房屋等问题。自市府上月初布告限期迁移以来，各厂厂方经过工业局解释说明，都已认识迁移的必要，设法解决困难进行迁移。截至目前止，已经找好新址进行建厂的有北京氧气制造厂；已经找好地址经市府查勘合格即将修建的有丹华、厚生、燕滨、保光等火柴厂和新中国、巨源、利丰等化学工厂，九龙斋、顺成合记等花炮作坊；正在寻找新址的还有十余单位。此外，资金较薄弱的许多小厂，则正分别进行联合建立新厂。
    市人民政府为照顾各厂在未迁移完竣以前停产影响工厂收益，把各厂产品性质经过研究分析以后，采取了各种不同的处理办法，如对火柴工厂，凡已决定迁移的，准其暂时在原址继续生产，但须加强安全设备，保证不发生事故，经政府检查发现有危险可能时，则立即勒令停产；对新中国化学工厂，则准其在未迁移前继续制造硝酸银，但易燃的乙醚和丙酮则禁止在原址继续生产。
