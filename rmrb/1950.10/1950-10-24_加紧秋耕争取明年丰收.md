　　Intensify Autumn Cultivation to Strive for a Bumper Harvest Next Year
    Zhang Linchi
    At present, the autumn harvest across the country has largely concluded, and autumn planting is nearing completion. The plowing of winter fallow land has become the central task of current agricultural activities. In general areas, autumn plowing (or winter plowing) is one of the main keys determining next year's harvest. Many regions have already attached great importance to this work, making specific arrangements simultaneously with the autumn harvest, and are now close to completion (especially in Chabei, where the masses previously had poor autumn plowing habits, but this year, due to strong leadership, more than three million mu were plowed by late September, reaching about 50% of all arable land); some regions started late and are just now beginning to plow; some regions are still hesitating and delaying due to a lack of animal power or other difficulties; and some regions, satisfied with the masses' farming habits or last year's autumn plowing achievements, have neglected the organization and leadership of autumn plowing work, falling into a state of drift or stagnation.

    As we all know, autumn plowing can reduce water evaporation and facilitate the penetration of winter rain and snow, thus alleviating spring drought and facilitating timely sowing, which is an extremely important measure for drought prevention; especially in regions that frequently suffer from spring drought and are preparing to plant cotton next year, autumn plowing is essential. Secondly, plowed soil layers are more easily weathered, making the soil looser and easier for crops to absorb nutrients. At the same time, ground litter, fallen leaves, and weeds can be turned underground to decompose, increasing organic fertilizer (which is exactly what farmers mean by "for good crops, plow deep and fertilize well"). What we should especially value is the great effect of autumn plowing on preventing and controlling pests. Most pests overwinter in various forms (eggs, larvae, pupae, adults) hidden in roots, weeds, and soil. Autumn plowing can turn those on the ground underneath to suffocate them, and those underneath to the surface to freeze them, or for birds to eat. For example, after deep plowing for rice stem borers, picking up and burning the rice roots exposed on the soil surface, even those deeply buried in the soil that do not suffocate will have difficulty flying out to mate and lay eggs in the coming spring. This year, the occurrence of rice stem borers in Jiangxi is extremely low, which is due to the use of winter plowing prevention methods, and the effect is very obvious. There are many other examples of autumn plowing reducing pests in other regions. Farmers also deeply understand this principle: "One household does not autumn plow, a thousand households suffer from pests." Therefore, in areas suitable for autumn plowing, we should regard this year's autumn plowing work as a major link in ensuring increased production next year, and vigorously call on all areas suitable for autumn plowing to launch a universal plowing movement. At present, all areas suitable for autumn plowing that have not yet started plowing, or have not yet universally plowed, should mobilize and organize the masses, overcome all difficulties, and take immediate action.

    In some regions, the current autumn plowing work is being carried out in conjunction with rectification of work style and summarizing work. This has resulted in summarizing experience and improving leadership, thus achieving good results. In some villages in the provinces of Chahar and Shanxi, the facts of autumn plowing and increased grain production have been used to educate and promote the masses who are afraid of trouble and hard work through comparison campaigns. This experience is worth learning from in all regions. However, in some regions, leading organs have been carrying out rectification in isolation, neglecting the current autumn plowing work; some cadres have even abandoned leadership of autumn plowing under the pretext of opposing coercion and commandism; and some regions believe that the masses have a habit of autumn plowing and there is no need for further supervision. All these deviations have led to the bad result of autumn plowing drifting aimlessly, which urgently needs to be corrected. In areas where land reform is being implemented this winter, leaders at all levels must grasp the principle of combining land reform with production, seize this work, and propose solutions to the issue of autumn plowing labor prices when land ownership changes as soon as possible, to dispel the masses' concerns and prevent this important farming process from being delayed.

    Labor and animal power are extremely important issues in autumn plowing. At present, animal power is generally insufficient. We must be good at organizing and overcoming these difficulties to carry out this work tenaciously. Last year, Chahar organized a large number of people to pull plows, successfully completing autumn plowing. All regions with extreme shortages of animal power should learn from this experience, mobilizing and organizing farmers to give full play to their labor enthusiasm to complete autumn plowing. Regions with fewer draft animals should encourage the organization of combined human and animal teams, and the exchange of human and animal labor, to reasonably solve the issues of cattle feed and cattle labor prices, so that existing draft animals can exert their maximum effectiveness. Regions with sufficient labor and animal power should organize and mobilize the masses to finish plowing their own land early, and then go to neighboring regions with a shortage of labor and animal power to sell their services, ensuring they receive reasonable labor prices. This will greatly contribute to solving the difficulty of labor and animal power and completing autumn plowing.

    Autumn plowing should be as deep as possible. Deep plowing yields a larger harvest. Not only have the results of farm experiments proven this, but most farmers also have the experience that "an inch of deep autumn plowing is worth a cart of fertilizer." In areas where the topsoil and subsoil are not bad soil such as sand and gravel, we can try our best to plow deeply, turn over the raw soil to weather it, and thicken the soil layer. At the same time, we must plow finely and evenly. According to farmers' experience, "ten plows per step" can ensure that there are no uneven hard soil ridges between the topsoil and subsoil, which is beneficial to the development of crop roots and the absorption of nutrients.

    Autumn plowing is generally beneficial and harmless in most areas and should be universally promoted, but there are also individual soil types that are not entirely suitable. Last year, a county in Chahar forcibly plowed sandy land, resulting in reduced production and damaged land. This year, the leading organs in the province have paid attention to correcting this, and other regions should also take this as a warning, paying attention to the cultivation methods and whether or not autumn plowing is appropriate for different soil types.

    This year's bumper harvest is only a beginning to improving the lives of farmers, and we must never let this bumper harvest cloud our minds. Satisfied with the existing achievements, or the idea of "relaxing a bit after the autumn harvest" is unacceptable. We must be more diligent, increase investment, and strive for a better harvest next year. Autumn plowing is the foundation of next year's agricultural production, and it is an extremely important foundation. We must extensively and conscientiously carry out the autumn plowing movement, ensuring that "the plow does not stop when the ground freezes," and complete one round of universal plowing.

　　加紧秋耕争取明年丰收
    张林池
    目前，全国各地秋收已大体结束，秋种也将近完成，冬季休闲田地的耕翻工作已成为当前农事活动的中心课题。秋耕（或冬耕）在一般地区是决定明年丰歉的主要关键之一，许多地区对这一工作已很重视，在秋收的同时就作了具体布置，现在已接近完成（特别是察北，过去群众秋耕习惯较差，但今年由于领导上抓的紧，九月下旬已耕三百余万亩，达全部耕地的百分之五十左右）；有些地区动手较迟，现在刚刚开犁；有些地区目前仍在畜力缺乏或其他困难面前徘徊迟延；也有些地区由于满足于群众的耕作习惯或去年的秋耕成绩，忽视了对秋耕工作的组织领导，陷于自流或停顿。
    如所周知，秋耕可减少水分的蒸发，并可使冬季雨雪的水分易于渗透，因而缓和春旱，便于适时播种，对于防旱是极重要的措施；特别是常患春旱及明年准备种棉的地区，一定要秋耕。其次，耕翻过的土层易于风化，可使土质疏松，便于作物吸取养分，同时可把地面的枯枝落叶杂草等翻到地下，使其腐烂，增加有机肥料（这正是农民所说的“庄稼要好，犁深肥饱”）。我们应特别重视的是秋耕对防除虫害的巨大作用。大部分害虫是以各种形态（卵、幼虫、蛹、成虫）躲藏在根茬、杂草和土壤中过冬的，秋耕可把地面上的翻到下面闷死，下面的翻到上面冻死，或为鸟类啄食。如稻螟虫经深耕后，把露在土面的稻根拾取烧毁，深埋在土下的即使不闷死，来春化蛾也不易飞出交配产卵。今年江西稻螟虫发生极少，就是利用了冬耕的防除方法，这效果是非常明显的。其他地区因秋耕减少虫害的事例也很多。农民也深切地体会到这个道理：“一家不秋耕，千家受虫害”。为此，我们在宜于秋耕的地区，应把今年的秋耕工作看做保证明年增产的主要环节，大力号召一切宜于秋耕的地区开展普耕运动。目前凡宜于秋耕而尚未开犁，或尚未普耕的地区，应动员和组织群众，克服一切困难，立即行动起来。
    目前的秋耕工作，有的地区是结合着整顿作风，总结工作进行的，这样便都总结了经验，改进了领导，因而收到了很好的成绩。察哈尔、山西两省，有些村子，利用评比运动，以秋耕多打粮的事实，教育和推动怕麻烦怕费工的群众进行了秋耕。这一经验是值得各地学习的。但也有些地区，领导机关孤立地进行整风，忽略了当前的秋耕工作；更有的干部借口反对强迫命令，放弃对秋耕的领导；还有些地区认为过去群众秋耕已有习惯不必再加督促，所有这些偏向，都招致了秋耕自流的恶果，亟须纠正。今冬实行土地改革的地区，各级领导必须掌握土改与生产结合的原则，抓紧这一工作，并根据具体情况，及早提出地权变动时秋耕工价问题的解决办法，解除群众顾虑，使这一重要的耕作过程不致延误。
    秋耕中劳畜力是极端重要的问题。目前畜力一般不足，我们必须善于组织，克服这些困难，顽强地进行这一工作。去年察哈尔曾组织了大批人力拉犁，胜利地完成了秋耕。凡畜力极缺的地区，均应学习这个经验，动员和组织农民发挥最大的劳动热忱完成秋耕。耕畜较少的地区，应提倡组织人畜合犋，人畜换工，合理地解决牛草和牛工价问题，使现有耕畜发挥最大的效能。劳畜力充足的地区，应组织动员群众提早耕完自己的地，再到邻近劳畜力缺乏的地区卖犋，保证其得到合理的工价。这样，对解决劳畜力的困难和完成秋耕会有很大的作用。
    秋耕应尽量作到深耕。深耕收获量大，不只农场的试验结果给予了证明，大部农民也有“秋耕深一寸，顶上一槎粪”的经验。凡表土底层不是砂砾等恶劣土质的地区，可尽力深耕，翻出生土，使之风化，增厚土层，同时，并要耕得细，耕得匀，根据农民的经验：“一步十犁”，可使表土底层没有高低不平的硬土梁，这样，有益于作物根部发展和吸取养分。
    秋耕在一般地区是有益无害应普遍提倡的，但也有个别土质不尽适宜。去年察哈尔某县曾发生强迫群众耕翻风砂地，致遭减产和毁损土地的现象。今年该省领导机关已注意纠正，其他地区也应引以为戒，注意个别不同土质的耕作方法和应否秋耕。
    今年的丰收，对农民生活的改善仅仅是一个开端，绝不能让这丰收冲昏我们的头脑。满足于现有的成绩，或“秋收了松一松气”的思想，是要不得的。我们必须更加勤劳，增多投资，争取明年更好的丰收。秋耕，是明年农业生产的基础，而且是一个极端重要的基础，我们必须广泛地认真地开展秋耕运动，作到“地不冻犁不停”，完成普耕一遍。
