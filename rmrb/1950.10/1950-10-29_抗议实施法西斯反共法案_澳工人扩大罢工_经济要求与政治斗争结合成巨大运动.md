　　Sydney News Agency, October 28th: After the Menzies government of Australia formally declared the Communist Party "illegal" on the 20th, it immediately directed the police and "security" personnel to illegally search the Communist Party headquarters and staff homes in major cities, taking away large amounts of documents and books. This brutal action by the Menzies government has intensified mass protests across Australia, and workers are combining economic demands with the political struggle against the fascist bill into a huge movement.

　　Following the strike on the 18th by 26,000 dockworkers in 65 ports across Australia to protest the Labor Party's encouragement of anti-democratic bills in parliament, 14,000 members of the Sydney Federation of Ironworkers held a 24-hour strike on the 25th to protest the Menzies government's unreasonable persecution of the people's democratic rights through this fascist bill, and to oppose rising living costs. The strike by 3,500 railway workers in Victoria, which began on the 16th, has now expanded into a nationwide strike. They oppose the anti-communist bill and protest the arbitration court's deliberate delay in implementing wage increases. This strike has completely halted national railway traffic.

　　Under the strong opposition of the broad masses of workers, Australian Justice Minister Dixson initially had to order the High Court on the 21st to issue a temporary injunction restricting the implementation of certain clauses of the anti-communist bill; then he was forced to announce on the 25th that the validity of the injunction would be extended indefinitely. The Australian people are now continuing to fight for the abolition of this fascist bill.

　　抗议实施法西斯反共法案
    澳工人扩大罢工
    经济要求与政治斗争结合成巨大运动
    【新华社二十八日讯】悉尼消息：澳大利亚孟席斯政府于二十日正式宣布共产党为“非法”以后，即指使警察与“保安”人员非法搜查各主要城市的共产党党部及工作人员家庭，携去大宗文件和书籍。孟席斯政府这一横暴行动，使全澳的群众性抗议益趋高涨，工人们把经济要求与反对法西斯法案的政治斗争结合为一巨大的运动。
    继从十八日二万六千名码头工人在全澳六十五个港口举行抗议工党在议会中鼓励反民主法案的大罢工之后，悉尼的联邦铁工联合会会员一万四千人于二十五日举行了二十四小时罢工，抗议孟席斯政府这一无理迫害人民民主权利的法西斯法案，并反对日益高涨的生活费用。维多利亚州三千五百名铁路工人自十六日起举行的罢工，目前已扩大成为全国性的大罢工，他们反对反共法案，并抗议仲裁法庭故意拖延实施增加工资的决定，这一罢工已使全国铁路交通完全停顿。
    在广大工人群众的强烈反对下，澳大利亚司法部长迪逊初则不得不于二十一日下令由高等法院发布限制反共法案某些条款实施的临时禁令；继则又被迫于二十五日宣布将该项禁令的有效期无限期延长。现澳大利亚人民正继续为废除这一法西斯法案而斗争。
