Xinhua News Agency, 23rd dispatch: Since the Government Administration Council promulgated the "Decision on Abolishing the Feudal Monopoly System in the Transportation Business and Establishing Transportation Companies," the transportation business in various regions has made significant progress in the past eight months. According to statistics from the first Second Plenary Session of the National Committee of the Chinese Transportation Workers' Union, held in Beijing from the 14th to the 21st of this month: twenty-seven cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan, Chongqing, Jinan, and Bengbu, have basically abolished the feudal coolie boss system in the transportation business. Guangzhou, Changsha, and other places are beginning to carry out this work. Twenty-five cities nationwide have established transportation companies. The majority of transportation workers in various regions have also been organized. According to statistics from sixty-one cities, out of 511,911 workers, union membership has grown to 361,027, accounting for 70% of the total. In places where the feudal monopoly system has been abolished and transportation companies have been established, the living standards of transportation workers have improved, and transportation prices have been reasonably adjusted. For example, freight rates in Tianjin have been reduced by 72.8% compared to before liberation, but workers' incomes have not decreased. The fighting among workers for work caused by the feudal monopoly system, the wide disparity in workers' incomes, and the theft that was common among transportation workers in the past have been basically eliminated with the abolition of the feudal monopoly system, the increase in the class consciousness of transportation workers, the guarantee of material life, and the establishment of a new attitude towards labor. Transportation workers' unions in various regions have universally established and launched cultural learning and entertainment activities such as spare-time schools, literacy classes, singing teams, Yangko teams, waist drum teams, and drama troupes. For example, Wuhan has established fifty noon and night schools with a total of one hundred and forty-five classes, and five thousand eight hundred workers have participated in learning.

In order to implement the policy of anti-monopoly system and establishing transportation companies, the National Committee of the Transportation Workers' Union held the second plenary session to criticize the paralyzing ideas of some regions that underestimated the struggle against the monopoly system, criticized the commanding and bureaucratic work style of some union cadres and transportation company cadres, and discussed the relationship between the transportation workers' union and the transportation company. The meeting pointed out that the transportation company must rely on the transportation workers' union, absorb union representatives to participate in the company's management committee, and implement democratic management. The main task of the union organization is to lead workers in establishing a new attitude towards labor in their work, carry out labor competitions, and actively participate in and support the management work and various construction works of the transportation company. The meeting formulated the work plan for 1951: the main thing is to continue to implement the policy of abolishing the feudal monopoly system and establishing transportation companies. In cities where the feudal monopoly system has been basically abolished, the central task is to improve the transportation business, consolidate and expand the union organization, strengthen the education of workers, and plan to carry out workers' welfare undertakings step by step.

　　彻底废除封建把持制度
    各地搬运事业发展迅速
    二十五个城市建立了搬运公司，搬运工人生活得到改善，运价得到合理调整
    【新华社二十三日讯】在政务院颁布“废除搬运事业中的封建把持制度和建立搬运公司”决定后，八个月来各地搬运事业有重大发展。据本月十四日到二十一日在北京召开的中国搬运工会全国委员会第一届第二次全体会议统计：现在北京、天津、武汉、重庆、济南、蚌埠等二十七个城市已基本上废除了封建脚行头子在搬运事业中的把持制度，广州、长沙等地则正在开始进行这一工作；全国已有二十五个城市建立了搬运公司；各地搬运工人亦已大部组织起来，据六十一个城市的材料统计，在五十一万一千九百十一个工人中，工会会员已发展到三十六万一千零二十七人，占总数的百分之七十。在取消了封建把持制度和建立了搬运公司的地方，搬运工人的生活都得到了改善，搬运价格也得到了合理的调整。如天津市的运价比解放前降低了百分之七十二点八，但工人的收入并未减少。由于封建把持制度所造成的工人争活打架与工人收入悬殊甚大、以及过去搬运工人所常有的盗窃现象，已随着封建把持制度的废除、搬运工人的阶级觉悟程度的提高、物质生活有了保障与新的劳动态度的树立，而基本上被消灭。各地搬运工会都普遍地建立并展开了业余学校、识字班、歌咏队、秧歌队、腰鼓队、话剧团等文化学习与文化娱乐的组织活动。如武汉市就建立了五十所午、夜校，共有一百四十五个班，五千八百个工人参加了学习。
    为了贯彻执行反把持制度、建立搬运公司的方针，搬运工会全国委员会举行第二次全体会议批判了某些地区轻视反把持制度斗争的麻痹思想，批评了有些工会干部和搬运公司干部的强迫命令和官僚主义的作风，并且讨论了搬运工会和搬运公司的关系问题。会议指出：搬运公司必须依靠搬运工会，吸收工会代表参加公司管理委员会，实行管理民主化。工会组织的主要任务是领导工人在工作中建立新的劳动态度，开展劳动竞赛，积极参加并支持搬运公司的管理工作及各项建设工作。会议制订了一九五一年的工作计划：主要是继续贯彻废除封建把持制度、建立搬运公司的方针。在基本上已废除封建把持制度的城市，中心工作是改进搬运事业，巩固与扩大工会组织，加强对工人的教育，有计划有步骤地举办工人福利事业。
