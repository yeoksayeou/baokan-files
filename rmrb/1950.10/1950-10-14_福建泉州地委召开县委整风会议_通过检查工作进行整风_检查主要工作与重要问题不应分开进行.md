The CPC Quanzhou Prefectural Committee in Fujian Convenes County Committee Rectification Meeting
	Rectification Through Work Inspection
	Inspection of Key Tasks and Important Issues Should Not Be Separated

[This newspaper's dispatch] The CPC Quanzhou Prefectural Committee in Fujian Province convened a rectification meeting for county-level cadres, carrying out rectification through work inspection. The meeting began on September 1st and ended on the 16th. Participants included county party secretaries, county committee members, and fifty-one party member cadres at the section chief level from directly affiliated organs of the prefectural committee and the special commissioner's office. After reading documents, work inspection and summarization commenced. Initially, everyone felt that: for the past year's work, there had been general work summaries every month, as well as special summary reports on bandit suppression, grain requisition, production, and rent reduction. Systemizing these would be sufficient to draw conclusions; this wouldn't be too difficult. At the same time, the leadership's requirements at the time were: to promote the spirit of democracy, master the weapon of self-criticism, conduct in-depth inspections, emphasize specific analysis of specific problems, and prevent abstract generalities; to make correct assessments of achievements and strict criticisms of shortcomings and errors, raising ideological understanding to the level of policy theory. After these requirements were put forward, everyone felt that the time was short, the requirements were high, and it would be difficult to achieve; also, there seemed to be many problems, with no clear starting point. At this time, the leadership proposed grasping one, two, or three major tasks and important issues for inspection and summarization, with secondary issues being easily resolved; an all-encompassing, egalitarian inspection method should not be adopted. In the seven days of inspection work, this approach proved to be effective. Everyone reflected that: this work summarization was much more profound than in the past; problems that were not recognized or were insufficiently recognized in the past were now clarified. However, development was uneven among units, with individual units raising many problems, concentrating on problems slowly, or feeling that everything was important and should be inspected, leading to the grasping of too many problems, affecting the deep inspection of key issues. This situation was subsequently corrected.
	This work inspection and summarization adopted two methods: one was to grasp several major tasks for analysis and summarization. Among them, eight counties grasped major tasks such as bandit suppression, grain requisition, and rent reduction for inspection. The second method was to grasp several major problems for inspection and summarization. For example, Anxi County used policy issues, work style issues, and the party committee system to inspect. In the work inspection and summarization, achievements were first affirmed, and then criticisms were made of shortcomings and errors. To avoid listing phenomena, special emphasis was placed on analyzing the essence of problems through phenomena. Finally, directions and methods for improving future work were proposed. However, on the other hand, due to the lack of good experience in summarizing work, achievements were summarized very vaguely, with the thought that rectification was about rectifying errors, so why talk about achievements.
	When studying documents, emphasis was placed on linking theory with practice; when inspecting work, emphasis was placed on linking practice with theory, so that specific problems could be powerfully analyzed and elevated. Some comrades did not grasp this spirit, especially in the work inspection stage, neglecting close links with documents, and thus making it impossible to quickly resolve the problems identified ideologically. There were also individual units that did not first conduct an in-depth and specific analysis of their work, but stubbornly labeled it as bureaucratism and commandism.
	In the work inspection and summarization, one should also connect with one's own ideological understanding and work style, making work inspection more concrete and laying the foundation for inspecting personal ideology and work style.
	When inspecting personal ideology and work style, a small number of cadres drafted separate personal inspection outlines, setting up a separate set of reflections on ideology and work style apart from the previous stage of work inspection, which would not be very helpful for improving future work. Although this approach was criticized, some comrades still did not thoroughly correct it, resulting in detours and making their self-reflection ineffective.

Editor's note: The two work inspection methods adopted by the CPC Quanzhou Prefectural Committee in Fujian Province are actually the same method. That is, through major tasks, such as the bandit suppression, grain requisition, and rent reduction tasks proposed by the Quanzhou Prefectural Committee, to inspect the policy thinking, work style, and other issues manifested in these tasks. Therefore, the inspection of key tasks and major issues cannot be separated for inspection; otherwise, it will result in general inspections, wasting time and affecting the depth of problem-solving.

　　福建泉州地委召开县委整风会议
    通过检查工作进行整风
    检查主要工作与重要问题不应分开进行
    【本报讯】福建省泉州地委召开县级干部整风会议，通过检查工作进行整风。会议于九月一日开始，至十六日结束。参加的有县委书记、县委委员、及地委、专署各直属机关科长级党员干部共五十一人。在阅读文件后，即进行检查总结工作。起初大家觉得：一年来的工作，每月都有一般工作的总结，另外还有剿匪、征粮、生产、减租等专题总结报告，把这些系统一下，就可以作出结论；这并不太费劲。同时领导上当时提出的要求是：发扬民主精神，掌握自我批评武器，深入检查，强调具体问题具体分析，防止抽象的泛泛空论；要对成绩作正确的估价，对缺点错误作严格批判，从思想认识上提高到政策理论的水平。要求提出后，大家觉得时间短要求高，不易作到；又觉得问题很多，无从入手。这时，领导提出了抓住一两个或两三个主要工作与重大问题进行检查总结，次要问题即可迎刃而解；不应采取包罗万象的平均主义的检查方法。在七天的检查工作中，证明这种作法是有效的。大家反映是：此次总结工作，比过去深刻多了；过去没有认识或认识不足的问题，这次都明确了。但各单位发展是不平衡的，个别单位问题提的很多，集中问题很慢，或觉得这也重要那也重要，都该检查，以致抓的问题较多，影响到主要问题不能作深刻的检查。这种情形随后也纠正了。
    此次检查总结工作，采用了两种方法：一种是抓住几个主要工作加以分析总结。他们之中有八个县是抓住剿匪、征粮、减租等主要工作进行检查的。第二种方法是抓住几个主要问题加以检查总结。如安溪县是以政策问题、作风问题、党委制问题来检查。在检查总结工作中，首先肯定成绩，再对缺点错误进行批评。为避免现象罗列，特别强调透过现象分析问题的本质。最后提出今后改进工作的方向和办法。但是另一方面因为没有很好的总结工作的经验，对成绩总结得很笼统，认为整风是整错误，何必说成绩。
    在学习文件时，强调联系实际；检查工作时，又强调联系文件，这样才能把具体问题加以有力的分析和提高。有些同志没有掌握住这个精神，尤其在检查工作阶段，忽视紧密联系文件，因而就使检查出来的问题，不能很快从思想上解决。也有个别单位对工作不先进行深刻的具体分析，硬戴上官僚主义命令主义的帽子。
    在检查总结工作中，同时要联系自己的思想认识和工作作风，使工作检查更具体，也给检查个人思想作风打下基础。
    在检查个人思想作风时，有少数干部另拟个人检查提纲，离开前一段的工作检查来一套思想与作风的反省，这样对今后改进工作的作用就不大了。对这种作法虽曾予以指正，但仍有个别同志未彻底纠正，结果走了弯路，使自己的反省作得不好。
          （王炎）
    编者按：福建省泉州地委整风会议采用的两种检查工作的方法，实际上是一种方法。就是通过主要工作，如泉州地委所提出的：剿匪、征粮、减租等等工作，来检查表现在这些工作中的政策思想，工作作风等问题，因此不能把检查主要工作与主要问题截然分开来检查；否则会形成泛泛地检查，而浪费时间，影响到检查解决问题的深度。
