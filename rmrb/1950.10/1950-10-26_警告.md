　　Warning
    Soviet Ehrenburg
    When I was in Belgium, I received a precious gift: the proof copy of the September 16, 1942, issue of "Le Soir," with the word "Extra" marked at the top of the first edition. The words below were printed in large letters: "Stalingrad has fallen. After weeks of fierce fighting, the European army has crushed the stubborn resistance of the Soviet army and today occupied one of the last fortresses of the Russian defense line."
    A man named René Leudesdorff wrote in this "Extra": "Stalingrad has fallen. Since yesterday morning, everyone has been waiting for the inevitable fall of this important Soviet fortified transportation hub. Our special correspondent from Berlin called to say that an unusual activity can be observed in the military and political circles of the German capital, which has always maintained calm and composure. Some well-informed groups told foreign reporters that important news would be coming soon. Readers can now read the bulletin about the fall of Stalingrad on this newspaper."
    In fact, the first edition of "Le Soir" left a blank space for this bulletin. The newspaper had already been typeset, and the proof had the proofreader's corrections. However, the bulletin was not published, and the "Extra" was not issued because Soviet soldiers were not satisfied with the work of the "Le Soir" proofreaders. They used their own proofreading – Stalingrad is the graveyard of foreign invaders – to delete the news boasted by the Hitler gang.
    "Le Soir" has long been discontinued. If René Leudesdorff and his colleagues are still working as journalists, they may have changed their names. Now, they are very likely not writing articles in newspapers, but shooting on the battlefield. The schemes of the "Fuehrer," the crazed private (Note 1) who attempted to enslave the world, have long ended in a tragic fate. Stalingrad and the Volga River are now attracting the attention of thoughtful people not with bloody battles, but with the tense creative labor of the Soviet people. The reason I decided to write about this unpublished issue of the long-defunct newspaper is because some memories flooded into my mind like a warning.
    "Le Soir" wrote: "The defender of European civilization has given the Bolsheviks a decisive blow." This newspaper was published in Belgium under Hitler's occupation; René Leudesdorff and his colleagues expressed the thoughts, feelings, and hopes of their German masters in French. The crazed private would not only suffocate children with poison gas, but also constantly lie and talk nonsense; he called a mob of invaders the "European army" and called the attempt to plunder foreign territory "defending Europe." These lies and hypocritical words were not buried with the "Fuehrer" in the ruins of the German Chancellery. Today, these words are being repeated by Messrs. Churchill, Schuman, Adenauer, and Sforza; they translate the thoughts, feelings, and hopes of their American masters into various languages.
    Dr. Goebbels wrote: "Our actions are driven by a sense of responsibility to Europe." Mr. Truman now says: "Our task is to defend the freedom of other countries. The United States, in cooperation with other free nations, has planned a great cause." The 1942 "Le Soir" wrote: "We must defend Western Christian civilization from the ravages of communism." Eight years later, the "Lütticher Zeitung" wrote: "We defend Western civilization and its Christian spirit from the red threat."
    Long before World War II, Goebbels wrote: "The red enemies of civilization are everywhere. In order to repel the threat from the red East, we must arm ourselves quickly. Germany – the outpost of European civilization – is preparing to repel the attack." Now, the prime ministers of capitalist countries are attempting to justify measures such as increasing armaments, expanding armies, and holding large-scale military exercises, repeating Goebbels' words. Naturally, they only talk about defense. However, what else did Goebbels, Goering, and the "Fuehrer" say? Goebbels asserted that Nazi Germany "desires peace and only considers Germany's security;" he initially used terms such as "red threat," "Asian expansion," and "the conflagration of communism" to scare his own people, and then used them to intimidate the residents of the occupied countries. Aren't Mr. Truman and his European governors busy doing the same thing now?
    The Hitler gang asserted that the Communist parties of many countries are a threat to peace. Goebbels wrote in "Germany's Future": "Communists are all Russian 'foreign legions'." Now Mr. Acheson, his followers Mr. McCloy, and some Labour Party members assert that "the Communists in France and Italy are 'fifth columns' that threaten peace."
    Where did the crazed private, who was called "Fuehrer," place his hopes when he turned empty words into bloody facts? People reported to him every day on the superiority of German technology, new methods of mass slaughter of human beings, and so-called "secret weapons." He forgot that there were people besides new inventions, and forgot that the outcome of war does not depend on bombs, but on people. Now, shouldn't those madmen who smile as they calculate the reserves of atomic bombs and who feel victorious after reading the routine reports of so-called "secret weapons" remember this? Shouldn't those fools think of the "Fuehrer's" march to distant Stalingrad, which ended with the Nuremberg trials?
    When talking about "defending Europe" and "the values of Western civilization," Hitler lied, trying to cover up his plans to conquer the world with hypocritical words. He hated any civilization – whether "Eastern" or "Western," "Southern" or "Northern." He gleefully subjected Europe to fire and sword. We know that he fooled a part of the German people for a while. However, those who are repeating Hitler's shameless lies today are deliberately trying to fool the people of all countries and every corner of the earth. This is not only criminal, but also foolish, because the time between the cries of Churchill, Reynaud, and Johnson and the cries of Hitler, Goebbels, and Goering is too short. Now, hardly anyone will believe General MacArthur's love for mankind, the humanitarian nature of the atomic bomb, or the sublimity of the plague-spreading fleas used to defend "Western civilizational values."
    The pretentious trick does not need to be watched twice. No matter what titles American newspapers add to those who are engaged in killing Korean men, women, and children, no one will doubt the nature and intentions of the executioners. I can easily guess that René Leudesdorff and his ten colleagues from "Le Soir" have joined the gang blasphemously called the "United Nations Army." Although there are adventurers from various European countries, former Hitler accomplices, or people who simply love plunder in Korea, this fact cannot change the nature of American aggression, just as the participation of the "French Legion," the "Wallonia" and "Wiking" divisions, and the Italian, Hungarian, and Romanian armies did not change the nature of German aggression against the Soviet Union. I don't know whether American diplomats, ministers, and generals can understand this meaning – they are too focused on dangerous and evil tricks, and they have no time to consider the lessons of the recent past. However, I am convinced that all good Americans can appreciate this meaning.
    Hitler frequently made unusually agitated speeches during the Spanish Civil War. This war was a rehearsal for him for World War II. Some people listened to his speeches with ecstasy, others with horror, and still others with an ironic smile. But at the time, no one wanted to stop this crazed private. At present, a war is being waged, which in the imagination of some overseas madmen must be a rehearsal for World War III. Since the beginning of the Korean War, Mr. Truman and his European governors have been constantly making speeches. They talked about the "red threat," the need for armaments, and "defending Western civilization." Despite their hypocritical repeated mentions of the word "peace," they are actually talking about preparations for a new war. However, it is still possible to stop them now. This is the duty of all good people, no matter where they live or what their beliefs are.
    In two months (Note 2), the Second World Peace Congress will be held in Britain. Representatives of good people from fifty countries will discuss how to resist the raging fire that threatens to sweep the world. The Stockholm Peace Appeal stipulates that the first person to use atomic bombs is a criminal. This is just, but it is not enough. In Nuremberg, Frick was tried along with other bad people. He had not participated in the planning of military advances. He had not participated in the equipment of gas chambers. But he had called for war, and he had cultivated hatred of other nationalities, other languages, and other ways of life. Is it not now time for all good people around the world to point out the politicians, generals, and journalists who are propagating a new war as war criminals? Is it not now time to list the names of those heartless, dangerous madmen who are preparing a new catastrophe in every country? Every disease has a stage of development. To cure a patient, it is mainly to seize the time. Now is also the time for us to stand up and resolutely oppose new war instigators. Their names need to be pointed out. They need to be counted. They need to be reminded of Stalingrad. They need to be reminded of Nuremberg.
    The leaders and ordinary citizens of the Soviet state have stated more than once their sincere love of peace. There is no problem in the world that cannot be solved by agreement. We have never thought of using force to prove the correctness of our ideas, and we do not think so now. We want to prove this correctness with labor, creation, and life. The Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station will neither threaten Chicago merchants, nor Louisiana farmers, nor Mr. Truman himself. The Turkmen Canal poses no danger to the British Conservative or Liberal parties. Even a fragile government like France will not tremble because of our tree planting. Every civilizational value, whether "Eastern" or "Western," "Southern" or "Northern," is precious to us. We have contributed and now contribute peace not only to our friends, but also to those who do not like us – everything will be seen clearly under the sun, and the future will determine who is right.
    We have never launched an expedition to fascist Berlin, but the fascists have launched an expedition to Soviet Stalingrad. Everyone knows what the result was. The imagined fall of Stalingrad had been written, but it was not announced. As for Berlin, it was truly occupied by the Soviet army.
    Let those madmen not rely on "secret weapons," nor on chance, nor on the fickleness of history. Victory on paper is easy: that unpublished issue of "Le Soir" proves this. In American newspapers, destroying the entire Soviet Union is a matter of five minutes, a matter of hundreds of dollars. They should not plan to move from base and filthy words to base and filthy deeds: their names will be made public to the world, and peace advocates will reserve the defendant's seat in the court for everyone who prepares for a terrible war at the appropriate time.
    I do not want to end my article, which began with recollections of Stalingrad, with words to madmen: Every Soviet person's excessive suffering and pride are inseparable from the name of the city on the Volga River. Young people, teenagers, and parents crossed the Volga River in September 1942 and maintained a small piece of land on the right bank. They sacrificed themselves for the motherland, for their relatives and friends, for steel-like truth. With their courage, they saved our people and all mankind, saved all children, all books, and the future.
    Let those heroes of Stalingrad who have returned from the war and are now working diligently, as well as the mothers, wives, and fiancées of those who died in battle, remember this. Let them know that Stalingrad, its merits, and its brilliance will make the madmen who plan new wars tremble, but will encourage all peace defenders – whether on the Volga River, on the Seine River, across the ocean, in the rubble of Korea – wherever the human heart beats.

专栏：

　　警告
    苏联爱伦堡
    我在比利时的时候，曾经收到一件珍贵的赠品：一九四二年九月十六日《勒齐亚报》的校对清样，在第一版的上端标志着“号外”两个字。下面的字用大号字母排印着：“斯大林格勒陷落了。在连续数周的激战之后，欧洲军粉碎了苏军的顽强抵抗，于今日占领了俄国防线的最后堡垒之一。”
    有一名叫雷尼·勒德松的在这“号外”中写道：“斯大林格勒陷落了。从昨天早晨起，大家就等候着这个苏联设防的重要交通枢纽难以避免的陷落。本报特派记者从柏林来电话说，在一贯保持着安宁和镇静的德国首都的各军事及政治团体中，可以观察到一种不平常的活跃。情报灵通的一些团体告诉外国记者们说，快要有重要的消息了。刚才公布的关于斯大林格勒陷落的快报，读者即可以在这张报纸上读到了。”
    实际上，《勒齐亚报》的第一版是留出一块空白给这一则快报的。这张报已经排好了，在清样上有着校对者的校勘。但是，快报却没有公布出来，“号外”也没有发行出去，因为苏联战士们不满意《勒齐亚报》校对者的工作，他们以自己的校勘——斯大林格勒是外国侵略者的坟墓——删除了希特勒匪帮所吹嘘的消息。
    《勒齐亚报》早已停刊了。如果雷尼·勒德松和他的同事们仍然继续作着新闻记者，那么他们也许换上了假名字罢，现在他们非常可能不是在报纸上写文章，而是到战场上去射击了。有“元首”之称，企图奴役世界的疯狂的一等兵（注）的心机，早以悲惨的结局而告结束了。斯大林格勒和伏尔加河，现在不是以血腥的战斗，而是以苏联人民的紧张的创造性劳动引起了有思想的人们的注意。我所以决心写到这个早已停刊的报纸的未出版的一期，只是因为有一些回忆像警告似的涌上心头来。
    《勒齐亚报》写道：“欧洲文明的保卫者给与布尔塞维克一个决定性的打击”。这个报纸是在希特勒占领下的比利时出版的；雷尼·勒德松和他的同事们用法文表达了他们德国主人的思想、感情和希望。疯狂的一等兵不仅会用毒气窒息儿童，而且也会不断地撒谎和胡言乱语；他曾把一群乌合的侵略者们称为“欧洲军”，并把掠夺外国领土的企图称为“保卫欧洲”。这些撒谎和伪善的言词却没有随同“元首”一起被埋葬在德国总理府的废墟之下。今天这种言词又被邱吉尔、舒曼、阿登纳、史佛卓诸先生重新搬弄起来；他们把他们美国主子的思想、感情和希望译成各种不同的语言。
    戈培尔博士写道：“我们的行为是对欧洲的责任感所驱使的”。杜鲁门先生现在说：“我们的任务是保卫其他各国的自由。美国协同其他各自由民族策划了伟大的事业”。一九四二年的《勒齐亚报》写道：“我们应当保卫西方的基督教文明免于共产党的摧残”。八年以后《利特·别齐克报》写道：“我们保卫西方的文明及其基督教精神免于赤色的威胁”。
    远在第二次世界大战以前，戈培尔曾写道：“文明的赤色敌人充溢于各处。为了击退赤色东方的威胁，我们必须迅速武装起来，德国——这个欧洲文明的前哨——准备着击退袭击。”现在各资本主义国家的总理们企图为增加军备，扩张军队，举行大规模军事演习等措施辩护，又在重复着戈培尔的言词了。自然，他们只说到防御。然而，戈培尔、戈林和“元首”们又何尝说过别的话呢？戈培尔曾断言，纳粹德国“渴望和平、而且只是为德国的安全设想而已；”他起初用“赤色威胁”、“亚洲扩张”、“共产主义的燎原大火”等词句恐吓他的本国人民，继而又用来恫吓占领国居民。现在杜鲁门先生及其欧洲的郡守们不是忙着同样的事情吗？
    希特勒匪帮曾断言，许多国家的共产党对于和平是一种威胁。戈培尔在《德国的未来》一书中曾写道：“共产党都是俄国的‘外国军团’。”现在艾奇逊先生，及其追随者莫克先生和某些工党党员断言，“法国和意大利的共产党人就是威胁和平的‘第五纵队’”。
    有“元首”之称的疯狂的一等兵，在他把空话变成血腥事实的时候，他把希望寄托在那里呢？人们天天向他报告德国技术的优越，大规模屠杀人类的新方法和所谓“秘密武器”。他忘记了除去新发明以外还有人的存在，并忘记了战争的结局不是依靠炸弹，而是依靠人的。现在那些微笑着计算原子弹的储备和那些读了所谓“秘密武器”的例行报告而觉得自己是胜利者的疯狂者们，难道不应该想起这件事吗？现在那些愚人们难道不应该想到“元首”向遥远的斯大林格勒的进军，已受纽伦堡的审判而结束了吗？
    谈到“保卫欧洲”、“西方文明的价值”的时候，希特勒曾经撒过谎，试图用伪善的言辞来掩盖他征服世界的计划。他憎恨任何的文明——不论是“东方的”和“西方的”，“南方的”和“北方的”。他以轻快的心情使欧洲遭到了炮火和刀剑。我们知道，他曾把一部分德国人愚弄了一些时候。然而今天正在重复着希特勒的无耻谎言的人们，却存心着要愚弄一切国家和地球上各个角落的人民。这不仅是犯罪的，而且是愚蠢的，因为邱吉尔、雷诺、詹逊的叫嚣和希特勒、戈培尔、戈林的叫嚣之间相距的时间是太短了。现在简直谁也不会相信麦克阿瑟将军对人类的爱，原子弹的人道性质，与用以保卫“西方文明价值”的散布疫疠的跳蚤的崇高性。
    装模作样的把戏是用不着看两次的，不论美国报纸给那些从事于杀害朝鲜男女和儿童的人们加上了什么名衔，没有人会怀疑刽子手的本性和他们的意图。我很容易猜想到《勒齐亚报》的雷尼·勒德松他们十个同事已经加入了冒渎地称为“联合国军队”的一伙。虽然在朝鲜有着来自欧洲各国的冒险家，从前希特勒的同伙或单纯酷爱劫掠的人们，但这个事实并不能改变美国侵略的性质，正如“法国军团”、“瓦隆尼亚”与“威金”部队、意大利、匈牙利、罗马尼亚军队的参战不能改变德国侵略苏联的性质一样。我不知道，美国的外交家、部长们和将军们是否能够了解这个意义——他们太专心致志于危险与邪恶的把戏，他们没有时间来考虑刚刚过去的教训。但是，我深信所有善良的美国人是能够体会到这个意义的。
    希特勒在西班牙战争期间经常异常烦躁地发表演说。这个战争对他来说是第二次世界大战的预演。对于他的演说，有一种人狂喜地，另一些人恐怖地，又一种人带着讽刺的微笑听着。但是，当时没有一个人想阻止这个疯狂的一等兵。目前战争正在进行，这在若干海外的疯人们的想像中一定是第三次世界大战的预演。自朝鲜战争开始以来，杜鲁门先生和他的欧洲郡守们不断地发表演说。他们说到“赤色威胁”，说到武装的必要与“保卫西方文明”。尽管他们伪善地一再提到“和平”的字眼，实际上他却在谈论着新战争准备。不过，现在制止他们仍然是可能的。这是一切善良人们的义务，不管他们居住在那里，不管他们的信仰是什么。
    再过两个月，（注二）第二次世界保卫和平大会将在英国召开了。来自五十个国家的善良人民的代表们，将要讨论如何抗击有席卷全世界之虞的熊熊烈焰。斯德哥尔摩和平宣言规定首先使用原子弹的人为罪犯。这是公正的，但这还不够。在纽伦堡，和其他坏人们一起，曾经审讯过弗里格。他虽未曾参与军事进军的计划。他虽未曾参与毒气室设备。但他曾号召战争，他曾培养对其他民族，其他语言，其他生活方式的人们的憎恨。现在可不是已到全世界所有善良的人们把那些进行新战争宣传的政客，将军们，新闻记者指为战犯的时候了吗？现在可不是在每一个国家内把那些准备新浩劫的，毫无心肝的，危险的疯狂者的名字开列出来的时候了吗？每一种病都有一个发展的阶段，想要治好病人，主要是抓紧时间。现在也是我们挺身而出坚决反对新战争煽动者的时候了。需要指出他们的名字。需要点数他们。需要叫他们想起斯大林格勒。需要叫他们想起纽伦堡。
    苏维埃国家的领袖们和普通公民不止一次申述过他们真诚的爱好和平。世界上没有什么问题不是可以用协议的方法来解决的。我们过去与现在都不曾想过用武力来证明我们的思想的正确性。我们要用劳动、创造和生活来证明这种正确性。斯大林格勒水电站既不会威胁芝加哥的商人，也不会威胁路易斯安那的农夫，更不会威胁杜鲁门先生本人。土库曼大运河对于英国保守党或自由党都没有什么危险。甚至像法国这样脆弱的政府也不会因我们植林而发抖。每一种文明的价值，不论是“东方的”和“西方的”、“南方的”和“北方的”，对于我们都是宝贵的。我们在过去与现在不仅向我们的朋友并也向那些不喜欢我们的人们贡献过和平——阳光下一切都会看得清楚，而谁是对的——未来即可判明。
    我们未曾远征过法西斯的柏林，可是法西斯分子们远征过苏联的斯大林格勒。所有人都知道这结果是什么。假想的斯大林格勒的陷落已被写好了，但却未能宣布出去。至于柏林呢，可真正被苏联军队占领了。
    那些疯狂的人们别依靠“秘密武器”，也别依靠机会，更别依靠历史的变幻无常。纸上的胜利是容易的：未曾出版的《勒齐亚报》的那一期正证明了这一点。在美国报纸上，毁灭全苏联是五分钟的事情，是几百美元的事情。他们不要打算从卑鄙龌龊的言词转到卑鄙龌龊的行为：他们的名字将公诸世人，而和平拥护者在适当时候将要给一切准备可怕的战争的人们保留被告席在法庭里。
    我不想用对疯狂者的话来结束我从回忆斯大林格勒开始的这篇文章：每个苏联人民过多的痛苦和骄傲与伏尔加河上的城市的名字是分不开的。青年，少年和家长们于四二年九月渡过了伏尔加河，并保持了右岸一小块土地，他们为祖国，为亲友们，为钢一样坚固的真理而牺牲了，他们以自己的勇敢拯救了我们的人民和全人类，拯救了所有的儿童，所有的书籍和未来。
    让那些从战争中归来而现在正勤勉地工作着的斯大林格勒的英雄们，以及阵亡者的母亲，妻子和未婚妻记住这件事吧，让他们知道，斯大林格勒，它的功绩，它的光芒会使计划新战争的疯狂者发抖，但却鼓舞着一切和平保卫者们——不论在伏尔加河，在塞纳河，在海洋彼岸，在朝鲜的瓦烁堆中——只要是人类的心跳动着的一切地方。
