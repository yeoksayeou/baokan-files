Telegram of Congratulation from the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party
    [Xinhua News Agency, 1st] The Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, congratulating our country on its National Day. The telegram reads as follows:
    To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:
    On the occasion of the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China，the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party extends its warmest respects and enthusiastic congratulations to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
    The great Chinese people, under the leadership of their working class and its vanguard, the Communist Party of China, which has been tempered in class struggle, have overcome the rule of the Chinese reactionaries and foreign predatory capital, and have won a historic victory. It has made the entire victorious socialist and democratic camp, headed by the powerful Soviet Union, tower over the imperialist camp, and has contributed a new and glorious confirmation to the invincible doctrine of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin.
    While the heroic Chinese people commemorate their historic victory, all progressive forces of peace are rejoicing. We, the Mongolian people, are advancing towards the socialist road under the constant, fraternal, and righteous assistance of the glorious, strong, and great Soviet Union, the bulwark of world peace and democracy.
    On this first anniversary of the People's Republic of China, the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party extends its highest expectations to the great Chinese people and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in building a people's democratic China.
    The Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party
    September 30th

    【新华社一日讯】蒙古人民革命党中央委员会致电中国共产党中央委员会，祝贺我国国庆，电文如下：中国共产党中央委员会：
    值兹中华人民共和国第一周年国庆日之际，蒙古人民革命党中央委员会谨向中国共产党中央委员会致以炽烈的敬意和热情的祝贺。
    伟大的中国人民在自己的工人阶级及其在阶级斗争中经过千锤百炼的先锋队——中国共产党的领导之下，战胜了中国的反动派和外国掠夺资本的统治，获得了历史性的胜利。它使得以强大苏联为首的整个胜利的社会主义和民主的阵营，凌驾于帝国主义阵营之上，并对马克思——恩格斯——列宁——斯大林的战无不胜攻无不克的学说，贡献了新的辉煌的印证。
    与英勇的中国人民纪念历史性胜利的同时，整个进步的和平力量兴高彩烈，我们蒙古人民正在全世界和平民主堡垒，光荣的坚强的伟大苏联的经常的兄弟般的仗义的援助之下，向着社会主义道路迈进。
    当此中华人民共和国第一周年国庆日，蒙古人民革命党中央委员会谨对建设人民民主中国的伟大的中国人民和中国共产党中央委员会寄与最高的期望。
    蒙古人民革命党中央委员会
    九月三十日
