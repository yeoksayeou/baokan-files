　　A Year in Review
    ——Written for the Anniversary of the Founding of the Great People's Republic of China
    Wang Zhen
    (I)
    The Chinese nation has always been brave and hardworking. In the past century, especially after the victory of the October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of China led the Chinese people in a long and arduous struggle for liberation, demonstrating the revolutionary heroism of China's outstanding sons and daughters who devoted themselves and sacrificed themselves. In the year since the founding of the People's Republic of China, all the fine traditions of the Chinese nation, in the new form of patriotism, have been concentrated in the military actions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which, following the orders of the Central People's Government and the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, carried the People's Liberation War to the end, liberated all of China's territory, and completed the cause of unifying China. Similarly, in order to quickly heal the wounds of war, they actively and bravely participated in labor production and construction, demonstrating the irresistible mass revolutionary work of not fearing difficulties and enduring hardships.
    The long-tested and heroic People's Liberation Army, at the time of the founding of the People's Republic of China, although it had eliminated the basic military strength of the enemy in the Northwest, Xinjiang, which occupied one-sixth of the country's territory, was still waiting to be liberated. When the vanguard of our army was approaching Xingxingxia in Xinjiang, and its follow-up troops were still in Gan (zhou), Liang (zhou), Su (zhou) and crossing the Qilian Mountains, the original Kuomintang army and government in Xinjiang, under the leadership of General Tao Zhiyue and Chairman Bao Erhan, announced their uprising and turned to the people. In order to guarantee the victory of this peaceful uprising, consolidate and advance the cause of peace, and converge with the ethnic minority armies that had been fighting for many years, they bravely advanced in the ice and snow, the vast wilderness, the deserted land, drinking snow and sleeping on ice, and reached the Altai Mountains, the Tianshan Mountains, the Kunlun Mountains, and the Pamir Plateau. In order to defend the sacred territory of the motherland and eliminate the American, British, and Chiang Kai-shek spies and bandits, the footprints of the warriors were imprinted on the Beitashan Mountains, on the Tianshan Mountains, in the Gobi Desert, and on the Pamir Plateau, the roof of the world, and they crossed the千里冰坂 of the Kunlun Mountains and entered the Gaize area of northern Tibet, meeting the Tibetan herdsmen who were concerned by the people of the motherland.
    In completing the above glorious and arduous military actions, the new patriotic spirit displayed by the army of the People's Republic of China is the inheritance and development of the heroic and arduous spirit of the unprecedented 25,000-li Long March of the great commanders Mao Zedong and Zhu De in the difficult days of the Chinese revolution.
    At the same time, on the labor production front, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, inspired by the new patriotism, displayed unparalleled hardship and heroism and the mass creativity to overcome difficulties, just as in the war. This year, the Xinjiang army is expected to cultivate 600,000 mu of wasteland. In the spring plowing, more than 840,000 mu have been planted, and in the autumn, more than 100,000 mu of winter wheat have been cultivated and sown, and residential houses have been built in the vast wilderness.
    This selfless and irresistible new patriotism of the People's Liberation Army is the source of victory for the Chinese people in defending and building the motherland. It will surely be carried forward under the banner of Mao Zedong, the creator of the great People's Republic of China and the inspirer of victory.

    (II)
    China is an ancient and large multi-ethnic country, and the people of all ethnic groups have a long history of friendship and historical relations. However, due to the policies of oppression, plunder and massacre by the reactionary rulers of the past dynasties, discrimination and estrangement between ethnic groups have been created. Now, due to the victory of the Chinese revolution and the overthrow of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has entered Xinjiang, and under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have entered a new historical era of people's democracy. Because Xinjiang is adjacent to the Soviet Union, the broad masses of people and intellectuals are influenced by the victory of the October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union and the victory of socialist construction, as well as the work of the Communist Party of China and progressive democrats in Xinjiang. In the local ethnic groups, there are Chairman Bao Erhan and Vice Chairman Saifuddin and other communist members, and there is a Fifth Army that has gone through five years of glorious struggle, which provides favorable conditions for the unity and cooperation of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and the construction of a new democratic political, economic, and cultural system, and the development of the vanguard of the working class—the Communist Party of China.
    After the end of the Kuomintang reactionary regime in Xinjiang, in order to implement the people's democratic dictatorship of the united front of all ethnic groups and all democratic classes, and thoroughly transform all Kuomintang reactionary regime institutions, a national democratic consultation method was adopted, and a Xinjiang national democratic united provincial people's government was established, absorbing advanced elements from all ethnic groups and all walks of life to participate in government work. Under the leadership of the provincial people's government and the Communist Party committees at all levels, a national democratic people's democratic united front was implemented, and representative conferences of all ethnic groups and all walks of life were convened. Among the 78 counties in the province, 60 counties and 3 cities (Dihua, Kashi, Yining) have held one or two people's representative conferences, and have begun the road of national equality, people's democratic transformation and construction.
    Promoting and training local ethnic minority cadres is one of the important tasks of the Communist Party of China in politically assisting the people of multi-ethnic areas in the border areas. Without communist cadres from local ethnic groups, without democratic cadres from local ethnic groups, and without cultivating activists from the working people of all ethnic groups to participate in the work, it is impossible to do a good job in multi-ethnic areas. After the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang, we sent a large number of Communist Party member cadres from the army to work in various counties and districts, and held 25 local cadre training classes throughout the province, with training periods of three or six months. The graduates included more than 3,600 people from 13 ethnic groups. More than 560 communist members from local ethnic groups were accepted into the Communist Party (excluding the military system), and more than 1,000 people were developed into members of the New Democratic Youth League.
    The Xinjiang Peace and Democracy League, headed by Ahmatjan and Saifuddin, has been reorganized into the Xinjiang People's Democratic League. This progressive and democratic united front organization has been formed throughout Xinjiang. Labor, peasant, youth, and women's organizations have also been developed throughout Xinjiang, especially the peasant association organizations, which have played a role in fighting against traitors and eliminating spies, abolishing the Baojia system, consolidating public security, adjusting land, mediating water conservancy disputes, rationally irrigating, implementing reasonable burdens, and developing production.
    All of this shows that the people's liberation movement of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang has begun a new era—the era of people's democracy.
    On the other hand, due to the long-term oppression and enslavement of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang by the reactionary rulers of China in history, it should be admitted that there is a gap between the various ethnic groups and the Han nationality. This is mainly the evil consequence of the great Han chauvinism of the reactionary rulers of China. Therefore, it also produced the narrow nationalism of ethnic minorities defending the ruling nation. This legacy of the old reactionary rule must be resolutely exposed, but it will take a long time to eliminate. Some of our cadres do not take into account the characteristics of ethnic groups in their work, and do not adopt ethnic forms, thus creating a commanding and bureaucratic style of divorcing themselves from the masses. This style is essentially a reflection of the remnants of great Han chauvinism in ethnic minority areas. Since June of this year, under the call of the central rectification movement, we have been conducting work inspections in various places. Many serious shortcomings and some mistakes are being corrected with the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to correct policies and overcome shortcomings.

    (III)
    The work of transforming the uprising troops is to resolutely and quickly suppress the rebellion launched by some counter-revolutionary elements under the policy of uniting the uprising generals and patriotic officers and soldiers, and to implement the policy of combining democratic transformation and labor production by letting go of mobilizing the masses in the reorganization. This policy was supported by General Zhang Zhizhong and resolutely implemented by Generals Tao Zhiyue and Zhao Xiguang. Now, the uprising troops have implemented the system of the People's Liberation Army, improved the relationship between officers and soldiers and the military and civilians, and have achieved great results in labor production, exceeding one-half of the planned 200,000 mu of land reclamation, namely 230,000 mu of spring plowing and more than 60,000 mu of winter wheat planting, and a large number of labor heroes and models have emerged.
    The policy of including and transforming and educating the old civil servants of the old regime was implemented, and a mass movement combining the elimination of special agents, the opposition of corruption and labor production was launched. In this movement, cadres were trained, the people were educated, and social vices such as stealing, prostitution, gambling, and opium smoking in the vast cities and villages were greatly reduced, and labor has begun to be regarded as glory by people.

    (IV)
    The struggle in Xinjiang in the year since liberation has taught us that the German, Japanese, British, and American imperialists, after the failure of armed intervention after the great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union, used the traitorous policies of China's reactionary rule and the reactionary elements of Pan-Turkism and Pan-Islamism in an attempt to establish a base for anti-Soviet and anti-communist activities in Xinjiang, and actively carried out espionage activities. Therefore, there are various kinds of special agent organizations in Xinjiang. The Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek special agents conspired to organize rebellions in an attempt to create ethnic hatred, all of which were suppressed in a timely manner. After arduous encirclement and suppression of the various U.S., British, and Chiang Kai-shek special agent bandits in northern Xinjiang, the old Bai Party and the armed bandits such as Osman, Jalim Khan, Yaolebas, and Urazber were eliminated, and the four special agent organizations, two special agent stations, and one office with a total of 38 groups of the Kuomintang bandit gang were destroyed. 198 Kuomintang intelligence agents and the most evil reactionary elements were arrested, and 80 bandit and special agent radio stations were seized and cracked. The peace and order in the vast areas of Xinjiang is becoming more consolidated.
    However, it must not be assumed that the counter-revolutionary spies have been completely eliminated. The hidden bandits and special agents are still lurking. They are still creating and spreading rumors, provoking relations between the fraternal ethnic groups, and conspiring to organize assassinations, rebellions, arson, etc. The bandit chiefs U and Yao have fled into the border areas of Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, and still need to be completely wiped out. This requires the People's Liberation Army and local public security forces stationed in Xinjiang to maintain revolutionary vigilance, and to unite and mobilize the people of all ethnic groups to fight for the thorough elimination of special agents and bandits!

    (V)
    The Communist Party of China is working in Xinjiang Province to realize a united, friendly, and harmonious family of all ethnic groups. We believe that as long as we adhere to Chairman Mao Zedong's instructions, are prudent and humble, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, we have a large number of democratic cadres and Communist Party members from all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, and these cadres are closely connected with the people; with the concern and assistance of the Central People's Government to the multi-ethnic people of Xinjiang, and the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, the sincere and selfless assistance of the great friendly country of the Soviet Union, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army maintaining a high degree of vigilance, loyally defending the motherland, protecting local revolutionary order, and diligently participating in production and construction, under the leadership of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Northwest Military and Political Committee, we will be able to complete the task of the Central Government and the Central People's Government in building Xinjiang.
    On the occasion of the anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China, we hereby celebrate the grand National Day festival for the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and cheer for the great People's Republic of China and the great leader Mao Zedong!

　　一年来的回顾
    ——为伟大中华人民共和国成立周年而作
    王震
    （一）
    中华民族从来就是勇敢勤劳的，近百年来，特别是苏联十月社会主义革命胜利以后，中国共产党领导中国人民进行长期的、艰苦的解放斗争，表现了中国优秀儿女的奋不顾身，自我牺牲的革命英雄主义。在中华人民共和国成立的一年以来，中华民族一切优秀传统，以新的爱国主义形态，集中表现在中国人民解放军奉行中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会的命令，将人民解放战争进行到底，解放中国全部领土，完成统一中国的事业的军事行动中。同样，为了迅速医治战争创伤，积极地和奋勇地参加了劳动生产建设，表现了不怕困难，忍受艰苦等等的不可抗拒的群众性的革命工作。
    久经考验的英勇的人民解放军，正当中华人民共和国成立之时，虽然消灭了西北敌人的基本军事力量，但是占有全国领土六分之一的新疆仍待解放。当我军先头部队已接近新疆之猩猩峡，其后续部队尚在甘（州）、凉（州）、肃（州）和翻越祁连山时，新疆原国民党的军队和政府在陶峙岳将军和鲍尔汉主席领导之下，宣布起义，归向人民。为保证这一和平起义的胜利，巩固和推进和平事业，汇合多年奋斗的各兄弟民族的民族军，在冰雪严寒，千里漠野，渺无人烟，饮雪卧冰中，奋勇前进，进抵了阿尔泰山、天山、昆仑山和帕米尔高原。为了捍卫祖国神圣领土，肃清美英蒋间谍匪徒，勇士足迹，遍印在北塔山上、在天山上、在戈壁沙漠中和在世界屋脊帕米尔高原上，更越过了昆仑山的千里冰坂，进入了西藏北部改则区，见到了祖国人民关怀的藏族牧民。
    在完成以上光荣而艰苦的军事行动中，中华人民共和国军队所显示的新的爱国主义精神，是伟大统帅毛泽东和朱德同志在中国革命艰难日子里，史无前例的两万五千里长征的英勇艰苦精神的继承和发扬。
    同时，在劳动生产战线上，中国人民解放军为新的爱国主义所鼓舞，如在战争中一样，显示了无比的艰苦英勇与克服困难的群众性的创造力。今年新疆军队预计开荒种地六十万亩，在春耕中已经种了八十四万余亩，在秋季又垦荒播种冬麦十余万亩，并在广漠荒野上建筑了居住的房舍。
    人民解放军这种奋不顾身，不可抗拒的新的爱国主义，是中国人民捍卫祖国和建设祖国胜利的源泉，她必将在伟大中华人民共和国的缔造者和胜利的鼓舞者毛泽东的旗帜下发扬光大。
    （二）
    中国是一个古老的多民族的大国，各族人民是有着悠久的友谊和历史关系的。但是，由于历代反动统治者的压迫掠夺屠杀政策，造成了民族间的歧视和隔阂。现在，由于中国革命的胜利，推翻了国民党的反动统治，中国人民解放军进入新疆，在中国共产党和中华人民共和国中央人民政府领导下，使新疆各族人民进入了人民民主的新的历史时代。由于新疆和苏联接壤，广大人民和知识分子受苏联十月社会主义革命胜利和社会主义建设胜利的影响，以及中国共产党和进步民主人士曾经在新疆的工作，在本地民族中有鲍尔汉主席和赛福鼎副主席及其他共产主义分子，有一支经过五年光荣斗争的第五军，这对于新疆各民族的团结合作以及建设新民主主义的政治、经济、文化和发展工人阶级的先锋队——中国共产党等具备了稳步前进的有利条件。
    在新疆的国民党反动政权宣告结束后，为了实行各民族、各民主阶级联合的人民民主专政，彻底改造一切国民党反动政权机构，采取了民族民主的协商方法，成立了新疆民族民主联合的省人民政府，吸收了各族各界的先进分子参加政府工作，并在省人民政府及各级共产党党委的领导下，实行民族民主的人民民主统一战线，召开了各族各界代表会议。全疆七十八县中已有六十个县及三个市（迪化、喀什、伊宁）开过一次或两次人民代表会议，开始了民族平等的人民民主改造和建设的道路。
    提拔与培养本地民族干部是中国共产党在政治上援助边疆多民族地区人民的重要任务之一。没有本地民族的共产主义分子干部，没有本地民族的民主分子干部，不培养各族劳动人民中的积极分子参加工作，要想做好多民族地区的工作是不可能的。新疆和平解放后，我们曾从部队中派出了大批共产党员干部至各县区工作，并在全疆开办了二十五个地方干部训练班，进行了三个月或六个月不等的训练，已毕业的学员包括有十三个民族，共三千六百余人。接收了五百六十余本地民族中的共产主义分子加入共产党（军队系统在外），发展了千人以上为新民主主义青年团员。
    以阿合买提江、赛福鼎为首的新疆保卫和平民主同盟，已经改组为新疆人民民主同盟，这个进步的、民主统一战线的组织，已在全疆各地组成起来了。工、农、青、妇等团体也已经在全疆发展起来了，特别是农会组织，它在反奸肃特，废除保甲，巩固治安，调剂土地，调解水利纠纷，合理灌溉，实行合理负担，发展生产上都起了作用。
    一切这些就说明了新疆各兄弟民族人民解放运动已开始了一个新的时代——人民民主的时代。
    另一方面，由于历史上新疆各族人民长期受中国反动统治者所压迫和奴役，应该承认各民族和汉族之间是有着隔阂的，这主要是中国反动统治者大汉族主义所造成的恶果，因此，也产生了少数民族防御统治民族的狭隘民族主义，这种旧的反动统治遗迹，必须加以坚决揭露，但这是要经过长时期才能消灭的。我们某些干部在工作中不照顾民族特点，不通过民族形式，因而产生命令主义和官僚主义脱离群众的作风，这种作风在少数民族区域实质上就是大汉族主义残余的反映。从今年六月以来，我们在中央整风运动的号召下，已在各地进行工作检查，许多严重缺点和某些错误，正以批评与自我批评的武器来端正政策，克服缺点。
    （三）
    改造起义部队的工作，是在团结起义将领和爱国官兵的方针下，坚决迅速地镇压了部分的反革命分子所发动的叛乱，实行整编中放手发动群众采取民主改造与劳动生产相结合的方针。这个方针是得到了张治中将军的支持和陶峙岳、赵锡光将军的坚决执行的。现在，起义部队已经实行了人民解放军的制度，改善了官兵和军民关系，并在劳动生产中获得了很大成绩，超过预定开荒二十万亩土地计划的二分之一，即春耕二十三万亩和种冬麦六万余亩，并出现了大批劳动英雄模范。
    对旧政权的旧公务人员，实行包下来进行改造教育的方针，开展了肃清特务，反对贪污与劳动生产相结合的群众运动。在这个运动中，培养了干部，教育了人民，广大城镇、乡村偷窃、嫖、赌、吸麻烟等社会恶习大大减少，劳动已开始被人们引以为光荣。
    （四）
    新疆解放以来一年的斗争，教训了我们，德、日、英、美帝国主义者曾经在苏联伟大十月社会主义革命后武装干涉失败后，利用中国反动统治的卖国政策，利用大土耳其主义和大回教主义的反动分子，企图在新疆建立反苏反共的根据地，积极地进行间谍特务活动，因此新疆有着五花八门的特务组织。帝国主义蒋匪特务阴谋组织叛乱，企图造成民族仇杀，这些都被及时镇压。经过艰苦的围剿扫荡北疆各股美、英、蒋特务匪徒的斗争，消灭了老白党和乌斯满、贾里木汗、尧乐巴士、乌拉孜伯等武装股匪，并摧毁了国民党匪帮的四种特务组织，两个特务站，一个处共三十八个组，逮捕了国民党特工人员及首恶反动分子一百九十八名，收缴与破获匪特电台八十部。全疆广大区域的和平秩序业趋巩固。
    但是，还绝不能认为反革命间谍就已经被彻底消灭了，隐藏的匪特还在潜伏着，他们仍在制造与散布谣言，挑拨各兄弟民族之间的关系以及阴谋组织暗杀、叛乱、放火等，乌、尧匪首逃入甘、青、新边境尚待彻底剿灭。这就要求我们驻防新疆的人民解放军及地方公安部队保持着革命的警惕性，并团结、动员各族人民为彻底肃清特务匪徒而斗争！
    （五）
    中国共产党在新疆省的工作，为实现各民族团结友爱和睦的大家庭而斗争。我们相信只要谨守毛泽东主席的指示，谨慎谦虚，戒骄戒躁，我们有了新疆各民族大批的民主干部和共产党员，有了这些干部密切地联系人民；有了中央人民政府对多民族的新疆人民的关怀与援助以及中苏友好合作，伟大友邦苏联的真诚无私的援助和中国人民解放军保持高度警惕性，忠勇地捍卫祖国，保卫地方革命秩序和勤劳参加生产建设，在中共中央西北局和西北军政委员会的领导下，是能够完成中央和中央人民政府建设新疆的任务的。
    值此伟大中华人民共和国成立周年纪念，谨此庆祝新疆各族人民欢度国庆大节并欢呼伟大中华人民共和国和伟大领袖毛泽东万岁！
    一九五○年十月一日
