Xinhua News Agency, Second of the month dispatch from Bucharest: The people of Bucharest, the capital of Romania, held a grand celebration on September 30th to celebrate the National Day of the People's Republic of China. The heads of the Romanian government, leaders of the Workers' Party, and General Wang Youping, our ambassador to Romania, attended the conference. Groza, Chairman of the Romanian Council of Ministers, Kisinyovszki, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, and Ambassador Wang Youping all delivered speeches at the meeting.

All major newspapers in Romania published editorials on the 1st to celebrate the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The newspapers all published portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong, and published special pages with articles discussing the victory of the Chinese people and their new life. The Romanian Workers' Party organ, Spark, published an editorial entitled "Warm Salute to the Chinese People," discussing the remarkable achievements made by the Chinese people in the past year under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the help of the Soviet Union in establishing a new country and developing the people's democratic dictatorship. The editorial emphasized that after suffering military and diplomatic defeats in China, American imperialism is still attempting to carry out despicable conspiracies against the Chinese people through its running dogs, and even using the most vile Tito clique to attack the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people. But all these attempts are in vain, and American imperialism has exposed its true face of aggression against the Chinese people. The editorial then expressed brotherly love to the victorious Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and their leader Mao Zedong, and stated: The Romanian people warmly congratulate the Chinese people on the victories they have achieved, and wish them continued success, because the Romanian people believe that these victories are their own victories, and the victories of the entire peace camp.

    罗马尼亚全国各大报纸均于一日发表社论，庆祝中华人民共和国成立的一周年。各报均刊登毛泽东主席的肖像，并出专页发表论述中国人民胜利及其新生活的专文。罗马尼亚工人党机关报火花报题为《向中国人民热烈致敬》的社论，论述了中国人民一年来在中国共产党的领导和苏联的帮助下，在建立新国家和发展人民民主专政上所获得的卓越成就。社论强调指出：美帝国主义在中国连接遭受了军事和外交上的惨败之后，现在仍企图通过其走狗们对中国人民执行卑鄙的阴谋诡计，甚至利用最下流的铁托集团来攻击中国共产党和中国人民。但是这一切企图都是徒然的，美帝国主义已暴露其侵略中国人民的真面目。社论接着向胜利的中国人民、中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东表示了兄弟般的热爱，并称：罗马尼亚人民热烈祝贺中国人民所已取得的胜利，并祝他们继续取得更多的胜利，因为罗马尼亚人民认为这些胜利也就是他们自己的胜利，就是整个和平阵营的胜利。
