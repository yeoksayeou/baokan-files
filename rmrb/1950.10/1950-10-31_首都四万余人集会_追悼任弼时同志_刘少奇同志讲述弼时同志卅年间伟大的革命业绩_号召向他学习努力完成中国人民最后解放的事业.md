Xinhua News Agency, 30th — Over 40,000 people from all walks of life in the capital gathered at 9:00 AM on the 30th to commemorate the great revolutionary Comrade Ren Bishi. Following the memorial service, the coffin was sent to the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery in the western suburbs. Peng Zhen presided over the memorial meeting. After the national anthem and mourning music were played, all attendees stood in silent tribute and bowed to the coffin of Comrade Ren Bishi to pay their respects. Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a brief speech.

Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out: Comrade Bishi joined the Chinese Socialist Youth League at the age of sixteen and, until the day he passed away, for a full thirty years, he buried himself in his work, disregarding position or title, and ignoring his serious illness, dedicating all his energy to the cause of the Chinese people's revolution and liberation. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: Comrade Ren Bishi was a model revolutionary professional, a model Communist Party member, and one of the best leaders of the Communist Party of China. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China are inseparable from Comrade Ren Bishi's thirty years of hard work and leadership in the revolutionary struggle. Comrade Ren Bishi's achievements were great, especially in youth work, political work in the army, land reform, and Party organizational work, where he made particularly special contributions. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out: Today, as we mourn the passing of Comrade Ren Bishi, we, our comrades, and the younger generation of comrades, must learn from Comrade Ren Bishi and strive to accomplish the cause of the final liberation of the Chinese people.
