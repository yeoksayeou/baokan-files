Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 17th: The first session of the Second Shanghai Municipal People's Representative Conference of All Circles opened on the 16th. This conference, approved by the Central People's Government and the East China Military and Political Committee, exercises the functions and powers of the Municipal People's Congress. It will elect the Mayor, Deputy Mayors, and members of the Municipal People's Government Committee, decide on future administrative guidelines and policies, hear and review the work reports of the Municipal People's Government, and re-elect the Shanghai Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee.

A total of 823 representatives attended the meeting. The representatives were produced on the basis of further expanding democracy, generally through full consultation, submitting candidate lists, and using democratic election methods. Among the representative quotas, the representatives of people's organizations reached 665, accounting for 80.7 percent of the total number of representatives. Therefore, the representatives of this conference can more directly and widely connect with the masses in the urban area and represent the interests of the broad masses of citizens.

The meeting was opened by Mayor Chen Yi. He first pointed out that since the Third Session of the First Shanghai Municipal People's Representative Conference of All Circles, after arduous struggles, Shanghai has moved from difficulty to recovery. The improvements are mainly reflected in the following points: First, the number of factories and shops that have suspended operations is decreasing, while the number of those opening and resuming operations is increasing; second, production and sales are increasing simultaneously; third, the number of unemployed workers is gradually decreasing; fourth, economic exchanges between Shanghai and other cities are becoming more active, and the scope of RMB circulation is continuously expanding; fifth, although prices have fluctuated locally in the past five months, they have been generally stable, ensuring the people's livelihood; sixth, some industrial and commercial enterprises have achieved self-sufficiency, while others have begun to obtain considerable profits.

Mayor Chen Yi then analyzed the reasons why Shanghai's industry and commerce have been able to improve. He said: First and foremost, it is due to the correct leadership of the Central People's Government. The People's Government has vigorously assisted private enterprises in overcoming difficulties in the face of recession through methods such as processing, ordering, purchasing, and lending. Second, the People's Liberation Army liberated the Zhoushan Islands and the Shengsi Islands, shattering the enemy's blockade of Shanghai and the coastal areas of East China; the People's Air Force fought bravely, preventing the enemy from bombing Shanghai, thereby enabling Shanghai's industrial production to gradually recover from the difficulties after the February 6th bombing. Furthermore, during this period, the People's Government, on the one hand, called on workers to endure pain and lower their living standards, taking the lead in streamlining institutions to maintain industry and commerce, and on the other hand, called on private industrialists and businessmen to improve their management methods, reorganize internally, and rely on their own efforts. At the same time, the People's Government also cooperated with all parties to vigorously carry out unemployment relief work. In this way, not only was the unity of the working class consolidated, but labor-management disputes were also reduced. In addition, the nationwide bumper harvest of agricultural products, smooth transportation, and overcoming floods have also been important factors in improving Shanghai's industry and commerce.

Mayor Chen Yi emphasized that the current improvement of Shanghai's industry and commerce is only a preliminary improvement within a certain limit. In the process of this improvement, some new difficulties and deviations have also emerged. For example, some entrepreneurs who have achieved initial improvements are developing blindly optimistic and blindly expanding production; some people who have idle funds are taking advantage of international events and the possibility of increased rural purchasing power after the autumn harvest to hoard goods in advance for speculation; some dishonest industrialists and businessmen emphasize that the government should take care of their enterprises, while turning a blind eye to the obligations they should fulfill to the government. These are all bad phenomena that should be corrected.

When talking about the current international situation, Mayor Chen Yi emphasized that we must not relax the necessary vigilance against imperialist provocations. He said: The heroic struggle of the Korean people has made a significant contribution to winning world peace and opposing imperialist aggression, and deserves our sympathy and support. It can be predicted that the Korean people will win the victory of defeating US imperialism in the future protracted struggle.

After briefly pointing out the major tasks of this meeting, Mayor Chen Yi said: The experience of the Shanghai people in the past year or so, especially in the recent five months, has given us more confidence to unite, concentrate our efforts, overcome difficulties, and move forward steadily along the correct path indicated by Chairman Mao. We must hold the Municipal People's Representative Conference of All Circles well, strengthen the unity of the people of all circles in Shanghai, strive for further improvement in Shanghai's economic situation, give fuller play to the spirit of people's democracy, and more severely suppress counter-revolutionary activities. He said: The continued improvement of Shanghai's economic situation and the better unity of the Shanghai people are of great significance for preventing imperialist aggression and building a new China.

The meeting also heard a report on the work of the previous Municipal Consultative Committee by Hu Juewen, Vice Chairman of the previous Municipal Consultative Committee. The meeting is scheduled for six days.

    代行市人民代表大会职权沪二届首次各界人代会开幕
    陈毅市长报告上海工商业已走上好转道路
    【新华社上海十七日电】上海市第二届第一次各界人民代表会议，已于十六日开幕。这次会议经中央人民政府暨华东军政委员会批准，代行市人民代表大会职权，将选举正、副市长、和市人民政府委员会委员，决定今后的施政方针和政策，听取和审查市人民政府的工作报告，并改选市各界人民代表会议协商委员会。
    出席会议的代表共八百二十三人。代表是在进一步扩大民主基础上产生的，一般都经过充分协商，提出候选名单，用民主选举方法产生的。在代表名额的分配中，人民团体的代表达六百六十五人，占代表总额百分之八十点七。因而，这次会议的代表更能直接地、广泛地联系市区群众，代表广大市民群众的利益。
    会议由市长陈毅致开幕词。他首先指出：上海市从第一届第三次各界人民代表会议以来，经过艰苦的斗争，已经由困难走上好转的道路。好转的情况主要表现在下列几点：第一是停工歇业的工厂商店日趋减少，而开业复业的日趋增加；第二是生产与销货同时增加；第三是失业工人逐渐减少；第四是上海和各城市的经济交流日趋活跃，人民币流通范围不断扩大；第五是五个月来物价虽局部地有些升降，但大体比较稳定的，使人民生活得到了保障；第六是工商界有的已做到保本自给，有的则开始获得可观的利润。
    陈毅市长接着分析了上海市工商业能够好转的原因。他说：首先是中央人民政府的正确领导。人民政府用加工、订货、收购和放款等方法，大力协助私营企业在萧条的境地中渡过难关。其次是人民解放军解放了舟山群岛和嵊泗列岛，粉碎了敌人对上海和华东沿海的封锁；人民空军英勇善战，阻止了敌人对上海的轰炸，从而使上海的工业生产能够从二月六日轰炸后的困难中逐步恢复。再次，人民政府在这个时期中，一方面号召工人忍痛降低生活水平，带头紧缩机构，以维持工商业，一方面号召私营工商业家改善经营方法，整理内部，自力更生。同时人民政府又配合各方面，大力进行了救济失业的工作。这样，不但巩固了工人阶级的团结，而且减少了劳资纠纷。此外，由于全国农产丰收、运输畅通、水灾克服，农村购买力提高，也是使上海工商业好转的重要因素。
    陈毅市长着重指出：上海工商业目前的好转，只是一定限度的初步的好转。在这个好转的过程中，又产生出一些新的困难和偏向。例如某些获得初步好转的企业家，正滋长着盲目乐观、盲目扩大生产的现象；某些握有游资的人，利用国际事件和秋收后农村购买力提高的可能性，预先囤货，进行投机；某些不老实的工商业家，强调政府应照顾他的企业，而自己对于政府应履行的义务则视若无睹。这些都是不好的现象，应该加以纠正。
    陈毅市长在谈到目前的国际局势时，他着重指出：我们断不可放松对帝国主义挑畔的应有警惕。他说：朝鲜人民的英勇奋斗，对于争取世界和平、反对帝国主义的侵略作了重大贡献，值得我们同情和声援。朝鲜人民在今后持久的斗争中，将取得击败美帝国主义的胜利，是可以预断的。
    陈毅市长在扼要地指出了这次会议的重大任务后说：上海人民一年多来，特别是最近五个月来的斗争经验，使我们更有信心地团结起来，集中力量，克服困难，沿着毛主席所指示的正确道路稳步前进。我们必须开好本市各界人民代表会议，必须加强上海市各界人民的团结，必须争取上海经济情况进一步的好转，必须更高度地发挥人民民主精神，必须更严厉地镇压反革命活动。他说：上海的经济情况能够继续好转，上海人民能够团结得更好，对于制止帝国主义的侵略和建设新中国，是具有重大的意义的。
    会议并听取了上届市协商委员会副主席胡厥文关于上届市协商委员会的工作报告。此次会议日程预定六天。
