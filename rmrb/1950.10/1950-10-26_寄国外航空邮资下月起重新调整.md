Overseas Airmail Postage to be Readjusted Starting Next Month

Since the opening of the direct air route between China and the Soviet Union and the airmail service to European countries via Czechoslovakia, the cost of air transportation has been reduced. The Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has recently issued a circular to post offices in various regions to adjust the overseas airmail postage rates starting from November 1st as follows:

　　(1) Airmail letters to the Soviet Union and various Eastern European People's Democratic countries, or to Western European countries via Czechoslovakia, will be charged at 60 centimes per 10 grams, with an actual charge of 6,500 yuan in Renminbi; airmail lettersheets (not available for Western European countries) will be charged at a reduced rate of 54 centimes, with an actual charge of 5,700 yuan in Renminbi.

　　(2) Airmail letters to Asian countries will be charged at a reduced rate of 40 centimes per 10 grams, with an actual charge of 4,200 yuan in Renminbi; airmail lettersheets will be charged at a reduced rate of 44 centimes, with an actual charge of 4,600 yuan in Renminbi.

　　(3) Airmail letters to Western European countries via Hong Kong and to other continents will still be charged at the original rate of 1 gold franc per 10 grams, with an actual charge of 10,500 yuan in Renminbi (airmail lettersheets are not available).

　　In addition to airmail fees, all of the above airmail letters are subject to additional overseas postage; airmail lettersheets already include ordinary overseas postage.

Note: The aforementioned airmail letters to the Soviet Union and various Eastern European countries, originally priced at 1 gold franc per 10 grams, have been reduced by 40 percent; the aforementioned airmail letters to Asian countries, originally priced at 60 centimes per 10 grams, have also been reduced by one-third.

　　寄国外航空邮资下月起重新调整
    自中苏直达航空线开辟与经由捷克转寄欧洲各国航空邮件后，航空运费成本业已减低，中央邮电部顷通令各地邮局自十一月一日起将寄往国外的航空邮资调整如下：
    （一）寄往苏联及东欧各人民民主国家或寄往西欧各国而经捷克航转之航空平信，每十公分按六十生丁计，实收人民币六五○○元；航空邮简（西欧各国未办）减按五十四生丁计，实收人民币五七○○元。
    （二）寄往亚洲各国之航空平信，每十公分减按四十生丁计，实收人民币四二○○元；航空邮简减按四十四生丁计，实收人民币四六○○元。
    （三）寄往西欧各国而经香港航转、及寄往其他各洲之航空平信，仍照原来资率即每十公分按一金法郎计，实收人民币一○五○○元（航空邮简未办）。
    以上各种航空平信，除航空费外尚须另加国外邮资；航空邮简则已包括普通国外邮资。
    按：前述第一种的航空平信每十公分原为一金法郎，此次调整降低了百分之四十；前述第二种的航空平信每十公分原为六十生丁，此次亦降低了三分之一。
