　　Reactions to the Armed Forced Marriage Incident
　　Letters from Comrades Shusheng and Others
　　After the publication of the complaint letter "Armed Forced Marriage Leads to Death, Local Government Handles the Matter Carelessly" in the People's Forum on October 10th, we received many letters from readers expressing their opinions on this matter. Extracts from the letters are published below:
　　Shusheng from the Industrial Economics Teaching and Research Section of the Renmin University of China wrote: "Chai Chunqing's armed forced marriage, resulting in death, is a serious violation of the law. Article 1 of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China clearly stipulates: 'The feudal marriage system of arranged and forced marriage, male superiority over female, and disregard for the interests of children is abolished. A new democratic marriage system of freedom of marriage between men and women, monogamy, equality of rights between men and women, and protection of the legitimate interests of women is implemented.' The criminal behavior of Chai Chunqing and others is aimed at continuing the 'arranged and forced' and 'male superiority over female' feudal marriage system that persecutes women, and it has even resulted in death, which is extremely serious. However, the Xintai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Government, and the People's judicial organs have not taken any action afterward. The 'district government only held one meeting, asking Chai Chunqing to make a self-criticism. At the same time, no action was taken against the village cadres and militiamen who participated in the armed forced marriage.' They have also turned a blind eye to the mother-in-law who abused Kong and colluded with Chai Chunqing to force the marriage, causing the matter to remain unresolved for almost ten months. We demand that the Yimeng Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Yimeng Administrative Office earnestly supervise the party and government leading organs and relevant cadres of Xintai County to conduct a profound self-criticism. The Xintai County People's Court should investigate this case promptly and handle it seriously, and publish the results in the newspaper."
　　Zhao Zhiwang from the Xingtai Town Committee in Hebei Province wrote: "Chai Chunqing's armed forced marriage, which resulted in death, must be punished by the people's law. If the local government handles this matter carelessly, how can freedom of marriage be implemented? How can human rights be guaranteed?"
　　Wang Yujing, a correspondent for this newspaper from the Political Department of the Air Force, wrote: "From the incident of Chai Chunqing's armed forced marriage leading to death, it can be seen that feudal ideas of oppressing women still exist very seriously. Moreover, the cadres and militiamen of Fuqiu Village acted as accomplices in Chai Chunqing's forced marriage. This further illustrates the seriousness of the problem. If the government and the court do not pay attention to this matter and handle it promptly, it will arouse opposition from the masses."

### 持枪抢亲事件的反响  树生等同志来信

　　持枪抢亲事件的反响
    树生等同志来信
    十月十日人民园地发表了“持枪抢亲造成命案、当地政府马虎了事”的控诉信后，曾接到不少读者来信，对此发表了意见。现把来信摘要发表如下：
    中国人民大学工业经济教研室树生来信说：“柴春青持枪抢亲，逼死人命，这是严重的犯法行为。中华人民共和国婚姻法第一条明确规定：‘废除包办强迫、男尊女卑、漠视子女利益的封建婚姻制度。实行男女婚姻自由、一夫一妻、男女权利平等、保护妇女合法利益的新民主主义婚姻制度。’柴春青等的犯罪行为，是要继续‘包办强迫’、‘男尊女卑’的迫害妇女的封建婚姻制度，而且因此造成命案，这是何等严重的事。但新泰县中共县委、人民政府及人民司法机关，事后竟对此不加过问，而‘区政府只召开了一次会议，叫柴春青检讨了一下。同时对持枪抢亲的村干民兵也未进行处理’。对于虐待孔氏、串通柴春青抢亲的婆婆，更是不闻不问，致使事情拖了快十个月仍未解决。我们要求中共沂蒙地委和沂蒙专署，认真督促新泰县党、政领导机关和有关干部作深刻检讨。新泰县人民法院应将此案件从速调查，认真处理，并将结果在报纸上公布。”
    河北省邢台镇委会赵志旺来信说：“柴春青持枪抢亲，造成人命事件，必须受到人民法律的制裁。当地政府对此马虎了事，婚姻自由如何能贯彻？人权如何能取得保障？”
    空军政治部本报通讯员王育敬来信说：“从柴春青持枪抢亲逼死人命这一事件看来，压迫妇女的封建思想还是很严重地存在着。而在柴春青抢亲时，浮邱村干部、民兵竟作了帮凶。这更说明了问题的严重性。如果政府、法院对此再不注意，从速处理，就会引起群众的反对。”
