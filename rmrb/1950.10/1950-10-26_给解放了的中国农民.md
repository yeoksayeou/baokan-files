    Dear laborers of the liberated land, our friends!
    Along with millions of honest Soviet people, I congratulate you on the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The historic victory you have achieved under the leadership of the heroic Chinese Communist Party and its leader, Mao Zedong, in overcoming the dark forces of foreign imperialists and domestic feudal landlords has given me, an ordinary Soviet peasant woman, immense joy. The Chinese peasants have won land for themselves at the cost of blood. The Soviet people are very pleased to know that the hopes and expectations of your ancestors for centuries have finally been realized. The suffering Chinese peasants, who have bowed their heads to landlords for generations, working as tenant farmers and hired laborers, have now become the true masters of the land as a result of the land reform. The injustice has ended forever. Your victory is great. You must protect and defend this victory from the encroachment of enemies of the people, both internal and external.
    Your feeling of joy is dear and understandable to me, because we, like you, are working people. Just like you, the male and female peasants of Russia and the peasants of many nations of Russia were slaves of feudal lords and landlords for many centuries. As for myself, what kind of person was I before the Great October Socialist Revolution? I was born into a poor peasant family in Ukraine. I was a female slave of the land, and fate arranged for me to be a slave to my husband as well. Perpetual poverty was the lifelong companion of our large family. I lost my father early in life, and as the head of the family, I took on the entire burden of supporting the family. In search of a better life, I moved to Ryazan Province and settled in a Russian village in the Rybnovsky District. If it were not for the Great October Socialist Revolution, I would not have found happiness here either. Only the Soviet regime and the Communist Party opened up a vast and unprecedented world of freedom before me. Only under the Soviet regime did I feel myself to be one of equal people. What kind of friendship can Anglo-American colonialists give us? They do not treat Koreans and Chinese as human beings, when in fact they should bow down to the ancient cultures of these countries.
    In a socialist country, the friendship of all nationalities is solid and inseparable. I am a Ukrainian woman, but I live in a Russian village as if I were in my own hometown. The Soviet government provides tractors to the countryside and trains me to drive them. I began to work not for landlords, but for myself and for my country. I learned technology, worked creatively, and I brought the high productivity of machinery into full play in our work team, and thus won the Stalin Prize. I served as a member of the Academic Committee of the Ryazan Provincial Agricultural Research Institute. In July of this year, I gave a report on my working methods at the Department of Agricultural Mechanization and Electrification Promotion of the Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences in the Rybnovsky District. This year, the mechanics of Ryazan Province elected me as their representative in the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Under Tsarist autocracy, could I have imagined such things? Of course not. At that time, I would have lived a life of destined destitution, a destined life of slavery in the family. My fate is not an exception—it is the fate of millions of Soviet people who have found happiness on Soviet land.
    Thirty years ago, our country was also backward. However, thanks to the heroic efforts of our people under the leadership of the Communist Party and the great leader of the working people, Comrade Stalin, our country has changed beyond recognition. Let me cite the Rybnovsky District where I live and work again. Now it has become an advanced area with comprehensive electrification. Now it has been the first to complete the entire agricultural campaign this year. And this is understandable. Electricity greatly reduces the labor of Russian peasants. Thousands of tractors, combine harvesters, and various other machines are working in the fields of our collective farms. Electricity helps collective farm members to mechanize all agricultural work. At night, electric lights illuminate eighteen village clubs, twenty-seven rural reading rooms, eighteen rural libraries, and also the district cultural palace, ten rural lecture halls, eight radio broadcasting stations, cinemas, the surrounding areas of machine tractor stations, fifty-six schools, the residences of three hundred and forty teachers and two hundred and seventy doctors and assistant doctors, the houses of agricultural technicians and livestock technicians, and all the homes of seven thousand one hundred and eighty-five collective farm members.
    Our people are developing simultaneously with the development of the country. Now is the second year that our district has begun to use electric tractors to work in the fields of collective farms. One of these machines is driven by Kharitonov, a collective farm member. He used to be an ordinary tractor driver who, along with all the collective farm members, jointly built the Kuzmin hydroelectric power station for the collective farms on the Oka River. When the electricity was connected to the fields and the electric tractors arrived, he began to learn new skills, and as soon as he started driving the new machines, he showed himself to be such a first-rate worker that even professors and academicians came to him to study his working experience as if they were going to a veteran or a highly educated expert. Nina Lemichova, the daughter of a collective farm member, used to live in Rybnovo village. After graduating from middle school, she was admitted to the Ryazan Pedagogical Institute. Not long ago, Nina Lemichova visited Rybnov village and gave skilled reports to the youth. This is how our collective farmers are developing. In what capitalist country can such commendable facts be found? There are none.
    Moreover, in these countries, the poverty of workers and peasants is increasing day by day, while the ruling groups are still arranging new disasters for the people.
    The existence of free people is not to the liking of the Anglo-American rulers. They have already launched a war of aggression in Korea and are trying to provoke a new war. However, the freedom-loving peoples of all nationalities, united under the banner of peace with the Soviet Union at their head, will surely shatter the conspiracies of the warmongers. We ourselves are our fortress. We can defend peace and strengthen the power of our country. We can consolidate the security of our borders with our labor in the fields. Since the moment we signed the Stockholm Appeal, our work team has been adhering to the peace work shift, and we can proudly declare that this peace work shift is glorious enough. On all the large tracts of land cultivated by my work team, the collective farms have obtained bumper harvests. This bumper harvest has been quickly and losslessly harvested. The collective farms have paid the state grain ahead of schedule, have prepared sufficient seeds and feed, and have paid the members more than twice as much grain per labor day as last year. Each of the fifteen-horsepower tractors in my work team cultivated one thousand two hundred and thirty-six hectares of land, while the original plan for this year was seven hundred and thirty hectares, and each also saved more than four tons of fuel. We completed the autumn sowing in a timely manner and deeply cultivated the autumn land for spring sowing, laying the foundation for next year's bumper grain harvest. Our self-sacrificing labor is a contribution to the common peace of all nationalities, because the stronger the Soviet Union, the smaller the danger of a new world war.
    Our dear friends, the labor-loving Chinese men and women peasants! We have always admired your ancient culture and your unyielding struggle against foreign oppressors and domestic feudal landlords. We admire your heroic struggle and sincerely sympathize with you. Now the heroic Chinese Communist Party is leading you onto the bright road. Follow this road with confidence and courage. This road, proven by the many years of experience of the Soviet peasants, will bring you a happy life, a happy life that has already become a reality for us.
    I sincerely wish you, the liberated Chinese laborers, to successfully complete the land reform throughout China, quickly restore the economy destroyed by years of war, and, following the example of your selfless friend—the Soviet Union—advance bravely on the road to progress.
    Long live the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples!

　　给解放了的中国农民
    达莉亚·加尔玛什
    本文作者是苏联里亚桑省雷勃诺夫斯基机器拖拉机站拖拉机工作队队长，苏联最高苏维埃代表。
                        ——编者
    亲爱的解放了的土地的劳动者们，我们的朋友们！
    我和千百万苏维埃正直的人们一道，向你们庆贺中华人民共和国成立一周年。你们在英勇的中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东的领导下所获得的战胜国外帝国主义者和国内封建地主的黑暗势力的历史性胜利，给了我，一个平凡的苏维埃农妇，以莫大的喜悦。中国的农民以流血的代价给自己争得了土地。苏维埃人们十分快慰地认识到你们的祖先多少世纪的希望和期待终于实现了。受尽苦难的中国农民们，曾世世代代向地主屈膝低头，作佃农，作雇农，而现在，由于实行土地改革的结果，而变成了土地的真正主人。不公平的情况永远结束了。你们的胜利是伟大的。你们应该防护并保卫这个胜利免受内外人民敌人的侵害。
    你们的快乐感觉对于我是亲切的，可以理解的，因为我们和你们都是劳动人民。也像你们一样，俄罗斯的男女农民以及俄国许多民族的农民在许多世纪中都曾当过封建领主和地主的奴隶。拿我自己来说，在伟大的十月社会主义革命以前，我是怎么样一个人呢？我出生在乌克兰的一个贫农家里。我曾是土地的女奴隶，并且命运又安排定要我成为丈夫的奴隶。永久的贫困是我们大家庭的终身伴侣。我早年便失掉父亲，作为一家之长，我便担负起了维持家庭的全部重担。为了寻求较好的生活，我迁移到里亚桑省，并定居在雷勃诺夫斯基区一个俄罗斯村庄里。假如没有伟大的十月社会主义革命，我在这里也是找不到幸福的。只有苏维埃政权和共产党才在我面前展开了从未见过的广阔的自由天地。只有在苏维埃政权下我才感觉到自己是平等的人们中的一员。英美殖民者能给我们怎么样的友谊呢？他们不把朝鲜人和中国人当人看待，其实在这些国家的古老的文化面前他们是应该俯首膜拜的。
    在社会主义国家内，各族人民的友谊是牢固而不可分的。我是一个乌克兰女人，可是我住在俄罗斯的村庄里就像住在自己的家乡一样。苏维埃政府供给农村以拖拉机，训练我去驾驶它们。我开始不再为地主，而是为自己、为自己的国家而劳动了。我学会了技术，创造地工作，我在我们工作队当中充分发挥了机器的高度生产率，因此获得了斯大林奖金。我担任了里亚桑省农业研究所学术委员会的委员，今年七月间，我曾在雷勃诺夫斯基区的列宁农业科学院农业机械化电气化推广部作了关于我的工作方法的报告。今年里亚桑省的机械师们把我选为他们在苏联最高苏维埃中的代表。在沙皇专制政治之下，我能想到这一类的事吗？当然不能。那时，我就要过着命定的赤贫日子，命定的家庭中的奴隶生活。我的命运并不是例外的——这是千百万苏维埃人的命运，他们在苏维埃土地上找到了幸福。
    三十年以前，我们的国家也是落后的。然而，由于我们人民在共产党和劳动人民伟大领袖斯大林同志领导下的英勇努力，我们的国家已经改变得使人认不出来了。让我再引证一下我在那儿居住和工作着的雷勃诺夫斯基区吧。现在它已经成为一个全面电气化的先进地区了。现在它已经第一个完成了今年的整个农业运动。而这是可以了解的。电气大大地减轻了俄罗斯农民的劳动。成千的拖拉机、联合收获机以及其他各种机器，在我们各个集体农庄的田野上工作。电气帮助了集体农庄庄员们把全部农业工作机械化。在夜晚，电灯照亮了十八所乡村俱乐部，二十七所农村阅览室，十八所农村图书馆，也照亮了区文化宫，照亮了十所乡村讲演厅，八所无线电播送站、电影室，照亮了机器拖拉机站的周围场地，照亮了五十六所学校，照亮了三百四十个教师和二百七十个医生及助办医生的寓所，照亮了农业技师和畜牧技师的房屋，照亮了所有七千一百八十五个集体农庄庄员的住家。
    我们的人们和全国的发展同时发展着。现在已是我们本区开始用电气拖拉机在集体农庄的田野上工作的第二年了。这些机器之中，有一架机器是集体农庄庄员哈里多诺夫驾驶的。他过去是一个平凡的拖拉机手，曾和所有的集体农庄庄员们在奥加河上共同建筑过各集体农庄公用的库兹明水力发电站。当电流通到田里和电气拖拉机到达的时候，他就开始学习新业务，而一开始驾驶新机器，他就表现为那样一等的工作者，连教授们和院士们都像到一个老手或者一个受过高等教育的专家那里一样，到他那里去研究工作经验。一个集体农庄庄员的女儿尼娜·列密卓娃，她曾住在雷勃诺村。她在中学毕业后，就考入里亚桑教育学院读书，不久以前，尼娜·列密卓娃访问了雷勃诺夫村，向青年们作了熟练的报告。我们的集体农民便是这样发展着。在那一个资本主义国家里会有类似这样可以夸耀的事实呢？一个也不会有的。
    不但如此，在这些国度里，工人和农民的穷困与日俱增，而统治集团却还在给人民安排着新的灾难。
    自由的人民的生存是不合英美统治者们的心意的。他们已在朝鲜进行侵略战争并竭力来挑起新的战争。但是，以苏联为首，团结在拥护和平的旗帜下的爱好自由的各族人民，定将粉碎战争挑拨者的阴谋。我们自己就是我们的堡垒。我们能够保卫和平，加强我们国家的威力。我们能以自己在田野上的劳动来巩固我们边疆的安全。我的工作队，从在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的时刻起，便一直坚持着和平工作班，并且我们可以自豪地声明，这个和平工作班是够光荣的。在我的工作队所耕作过的所有大片土地上，各集体农庄都获得了丰收。这一丰收已被很快而又毫无损失地收割起来了。各集体农庄都提前缴纳了国家公粮，备足了种子和饲料，付给庄员们劳动日的谷物也比去年多上二倍。我的工作队中每一部十五匹马力的拖拉机各都耕作了一千二百三十六公顷的土地，而本年计划原定为七百三十公顷，并且还各都节省了四吨以上的燃料。我们适时地完成了秋季播种并深耕了春季播种的秋地，而为明年的谷物丰收打下了基础。我们自我牺牲的劳动就是对各族人民的共同和平的贡献，因为苏联愈是强大，新的世界战争的危险也就愈微小。
    我们亲爱的朋友们，爱好劳动的中国男女农民们！我们向来敬佩你们的古老文化和你们反对外国压迫者和本国封建地主的不屈斗争。我们赞叹你们的英勇斗争并衷心地同情你们。现在英勇的中国共产党领导你们走上了光明的道路。你们确信而勇敢地循着这条道路前进吧。这一条道路，已由苏维埃农民的多年经验所证明，它将带给你们幸福的生活，这种幸福生活在我们已经成为了现实。
    解放了的中国的劳动者们，我衷心地祝望你们在全中国土地上顺利地完成土地改革，迅速地恢复为多年的战争所破坏的经济，并照着你们大公无私的朋友——苏联的例子，向进步道路勇往前进吧。
    中苏两国人民永恒的友谊万岁！
