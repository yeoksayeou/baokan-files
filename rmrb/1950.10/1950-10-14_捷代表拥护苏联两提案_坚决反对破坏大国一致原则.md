The Czechoslovak Representative Supports Soviet Proposals, Firmly Opposes Undermining the Principle of Great Power Unity

　　The Czechoslovak representative, Mr. Hájek, in his final speech, emphasized that Czechoslovakia, having had the painful experience of the Munich Agreement due to the destruction of collective security, is extremely concerned about the issue of strengthening collective measures to maintain peace. Mr. Hájek said that the Czechoslovak delegation therefore supports all provisions of the seven-nation proposal that strengthen the United Nations, but firmly opposes provisions that attempt to undermine the principle of great power unity and illegally transfer the powers of the Security Council to the General Assembly. Mr. Hájek emphasized that the people of the world want to maintain the principle of great power unity because they know that this principle defends peace. Mr. Hájek said that it is undoubtedly the pressure of public opinion in their own countries that prevents the drafters of the seven-nation proposal from openly attempting to revise the Charter and instead attacking the principle of great power unity from the side. The suggestion to transfer the powers of the Security Council to the United Nations General Assembly is an attempt to make it impossible for the Soviet Union to stop aggression. At the same time, these suggestions also aim to disguise future American intervention under the banner of "United Nations recommendations." The United States has already demonstrated its aggressive imperialist nature by interfering in Taiwan and Korea, rearming West Germany, and establishing the Atlantic Group. Mr. Hájek said that the United States is trying to "legalize aggression" through this, and to gain the support of the Titoites in this matter. These Titoites are thus showing their willingness to engage in preparations for a new war. Mr. Hájek went on to say that the provisions for convening a special session of the United Nations General Assembly are acceptable, but the time limit must be extended and the illegal provisions for convening the meeting must be deleted. He said that the suggestion of a peace observation group is acceptable, if the composition is representative. On the other hand, Mr. Hájek rejected the provisions regarding the allocation of armed forces for use on the recommendation of the General Assembly, as well as the provisions for the establishment of a Collective Action Committee. In conclusion, Mr. Hájek warmly welcomed the two proposals put forward by the Soviet Union on October 11, and said that the touchstone of the attitude of the initiators of the seven-nation proposal is their attitude towards these two Soviet proposals and other Soviet proposals, such as the proposal to reduce armed forces by one-third. The Political Committee then adjourned.

　　捷代表拥护苏联两提案
    坚决反对破坏大国一致原则
    最后发言的捷克斯洛伐克代表哈奇杜强调指出，捷克斯洛伐克因为有集体安全遭到破坏而终于造成在慕尼黑事件的痛苦经验，所以极为关怀加强维护和平的集体措施的问题。哈奇杜说，捷克斯洛伐克代表团因此支持七国提案中加强联合国的一切规定，但坚决反对力图破坏大国一致原则并将安理会权力非法转移到大会的规定。哈奇杜强调指出全世界人民要保持大国一致的原则，因为他们知道这一原则捍卫着和平。哈奇杜说，使七国提案的起草人不能公开地设法修改宪章转而侧面攻击大国一致原则的，无疑是它们自己国内的舆论压力。把安理会权力转移到联合国大会的建议，是企图使苏联没有可能制止侵略。同时，这些建议的目的也是要在“联合国建议”的旗帜下掩饰美国未来的干涉行为。美国已经因为干涉台湾与朝鲜，重新武装西德和成立大西洋集团而表明了它的侵略的帝国主义性质。哈奇杜说，美国力图借此将“侵略合法化”，并且在这件事情上取得铁托分子的支持。这些铁托分子则由此表现他们愿意从事新战争准备。哈奇杜继而说，召开联合国大会特别会议的规定是可以接受的，但限定的时间必须加以延长，召开会议的非法规定必须加以删除。他说，和平观察团的建议是可以接受的，如果组成成份是有代表性的话。另一方面，哈奇杜又摈斥关于应大会建议而拨出武装部队供其使用的规定，以及成立集体行动委员会的规定。在结语时，哈奇杜表示热烈欢迎苏联在十月十一日提出的两项提案，并说，七国提案发起人态度的试金石就是他们对苏联这两项提案以及苏联其他提案如呼吁裁减武装部队三分之一的提案的态度。政治委员会旋即休会。
