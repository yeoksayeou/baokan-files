Minister of Central Health Department Li Dequan's
Report on the National Health Conference
(September 8, at the 49th Government Affairs Conference of the Central People's Government Council)

The convocation of the First National Health Conference was proposed at the Health Administration Conference convened by the Military Commission Health Department in September and October last year. That meeting decided that this conference would be jointly convened by the Central Health Department and the Military Commission Health Department during the summer of this year (so last year's National Health Administration Conference was actually a preparatory meeting for this National Health Conference). That meeting initially determined that the general policy for national health construction should be prevention first, the focus of health work should be on guaranteeing production construction and national defense construction, and it should be oriented towards rural areas, factories and mines, and rely on the masses. The results of the concrete implementation of these policies in various major administrative regions over the past six months have proven that these policies are basically correct. The purpose of the First National Health Conference was to exchange and summarize past experiences, discuss and more clearly affirm the general policy for national health construction in the future, and formulate some specific measures to ensure the implementation of this policy.

In the process of preparing for the conference and during the conference, we more deeply discovered that due to our long-term exposure to the multiple oppressions of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, the Kuomintang reactionary government did not pay attention to the people's health cause. Health care institutions were simple and unevenly distributed, some were only nominally existent and detached from reality. Factional divisions formed between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and among Western medicine practitioners. They were mutually ostracizing and only served a small number of people. The vast rural areas generally lacked medicine, and farmers could only seek gods and worship Buddha. In the event of disease epidemics, they could only resign themselves to fate. The total number of cases of illness in our country's entire population accumulated to about 140 million each year, and the mortality rate was over 30 per thousand, of which more than half died from preventable infectious diseases. Diseases that caused the greatest harm such as plague, cholera, measles, smallpox, typhoid, dysentery, epidemic typhus, and relapsing fever. Diseases like kala-azar, Japanese schistosomiasis, malaria, leprosy, and venereal diseases greatly infringed on the health of the people. The vast majority of women still relied on old midwives for childbirth, resulting in an infant mortality rate of about 40%.

The conference opened on August 7th and lasted for 13 days (including one day of rest and a visit to the health exhibition). It closed on the 19th. 421 people attended and 161 people were present as observers, including the heads of health departments of various regions and armies, and famous experts in traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. Based on the current health situation in our country and the principle of prevention first, the conference conducted in-depth discussions. On the basis of striving to improve and develop the national grassroots health organizations within three to five years, after discussion, the differences on issues such as medical education were unified, some Western medicine practitioners were persuaded of their extreme views on traditional Chinese medicine, and the fears of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners were eliminated, reaching an agreement to determine "serving workers, peasants and soldiers," "prevention first," and "uniting traditional Chinese and Western medicine" as the three major principles of health work, and resolutions were made on developing medical education to train a large number of health talents, establishing and developing national grassroots health organizations, adjusting the public-private relationship in the health sector, uniting and transforming the medical community, and rectifying hospitals. This shows that the conference was successful, and it also demonstrates the new atmosphere of the new China's health and medicine community.

Now, I will give a general explanation of several main issues discussed at this conference:

I. On the Principle of Prevention First

Medicine is the science of mankind fighting against disease, and the entire people participate in this struggle. Health workers are the vanguards of this struggle, and the organizers and leaders of this struggle. If health workers do not teach this science, this method of struggle to the people, and do not make the people understand how to do it and do it themselves, relying solely on a small number of health workers cannot completely solve the problem. In the past, health work was isolated from the masses, and therefore there was only a purely treatment-oriented view. Now, with serving the people as a prerequisite, we do not wait for people to get sick and come to us, but we take the initiative to mobilize the masses to fight against disease. This active struggle must be prevention first. Therefore, the principle of prevention first is based on serving the people and first serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. For health workers themselves, only by recognizing this prerequisite and standing firm on this position can they truly achieve prevention first.

II. On Establishing Grassroots Health Organizations

Establishing grassroots health organizations at all levels across the country to solve the health needs of the masses is a key task to realize the health cause serving the people, first serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. If we want to solve problems for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we must establish grassroots health organizations. This work is arduous, but we must strive to basically complete this task within three to five years, that is, to enable most counties in China to have health organizations with two to seven specialist doctors and one pharmacist or dispenser, and gradually enable each district to have health clinics with one to two medical assistants and one midwife. Factories, mines, and neighborhoods should also have health organizations. The sources of these personnel are partly from school training and partly from adjustments among medical personnel in large cities, as mentioned earlier. In short, at least in recent years, our health construction should focus not on large cities, but on small and medium-sized cities, rural areas, factories, mines, and troops.

III. On Education Issues

The old medical education system in our country has only trained less than 20,000 formal physicians in the past 40 years. Such an education system cannot solve the problem in the face of current actual needs. Therefore, the first requirement is to establish a new medical education system to develop medical education and train a large number of health personnel. The new medical education system should be divided into high, middle, and primary three-level systems, and implement a specialized key system in higher medical education. The new medical education is based on improving on the basis of popularization, and popularizing under the guidance of improvement. In the current situation, in the national scope, popularization should be the main focus. In teaching methods, theory and practice should be combined.

IV. On the Unity and Transformation of the Medical Community

After liberation, the tasks of health departments at all levels of government are very arduous and glorious. All of our national health personnel, including traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine personnel, must unite and work together to complete the task of improving the people's health. In the past, the phenomenon of estrangement and sectarian disputes between the traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine communities was still very serious. Therefore, we raised the issue of unity and transformation of the medical community at the conference, requiring that traditional Chinese and Western medicine should unite under the goal of "serving the people" and carry out transformation. Both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine should strengthen political and professional learning, and truly achieve "scientification of traditional Chinese medicine" and "popularization of Western medicine." Health authorities in major administrative regions should be instructed to establish traditional Chinese medicine advanced schools or traditional Chinese medicine training classes in major cities in major administrative regions this year, and gradually in provinces and cities next year, or attach advanced schools, training classes, and spare-time schools to existing traditional Chinese medicine schools and societies (municipal medical community federations). There should be no restrictions on privately run traditional Chinese medicine schools (or apprenticeships), but their curriculum should add basic scientific medical knowledge and political knowledge. The curriculum standards should be formulated by the Central Health Department to achieve the goal of providing preliminary scientific training to a large number of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners across the country within two or three years, serving as medical talents in rural areas.

V. On the Adjustment of Public-Private Relations in the Medical Community

The principle of giving consideration to both public and private interests, as pointed out in the Common Program, should also be implemented in the medical community. Because the national economy is still being restored and the distribution of health personnel and medical institutions has not yet achieved changes suitable for the needs of the broad masses of people, the public medical system cannot be implemented immediately in China at present. Private medical services are still needed by society today. In the past, government health departments lacked experience and attention in guiding, helping, and managing private businesses, so in many areas, especially in areas with shorter liberation times, there are still phenomena of insufficient close public-private relations and some depression in private businesses. This problem should be properly resolved.

In order to solve this problem, first, we must better organize private businesses and have a reasonable division of labor for public health undertakings for people's health. In epidemic prevention and health care work, and in the regional responsibility system for public health undertakings, private hospitals should be given certain tasks. Certain care and assistance should be given to solving their difficulties. Tax reductions and exemptions will be considered, especially in rural and industrial and mining areas. Government health departments should provide regular guidance to private businesses, help them change their style, improve their technology, and improve their systems. Of course, those few who have improper behavior, such as deceiving patients and defrauding profits, should also be sanctioned. At the same time, medical personnel practicing privately should also take the initiative to change their old style, study politics, establish the idea of serving the people, and correct the idea of simply pursuing profit, so that they can have development and a future.

VI. On Rectifying Hospitals

At present, hospitals across the country have made preliminary improvements compared to before liberation. However, the style of some staff has not changed significantly, the spirit of being responsible and conscientious is not enough, the technology is not high, and conservative ideas are heavy. In addition, the medical system is unsound, and there are still many hospitals with dereliction of duty and accidents. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to this, which is worth reviewing. Therefore, the issue of rectifying hospitals is a unanimous requirement. It is required that all hospitals conduct a major inspection from three aspects: ideology, technology, and system; and rectify from these three aspects. First, leadership should be improved and a democratic centralized hospital affairs committee should be established. Strengthen ideological and political leadership for all hospital personnel, and establish the idea of "everything for the wounded and sick"; second, improve various systems and implement the system. When formulating the system, it should be considered how to meet the needs of patients, strive to simplify procedures, and conduct inspections and nursing seriously; third, improve technology. In addition to strengthening professional learning, patient summary meetings and clinical pathology research meetings should be established. Pay attention to disinfection and reduce complications.

VII. Military Health Work

This conference was jointly held by local health workers and military health workers, so it is necessary to talk about the work of military health. Serving workers, peasants, and soldiers has been the case for the health work of the People's Liberation Army for more than 20 years. The direction taken by the health work of the People's Liberation Army in the past was correct, and it will continue to follow this direction in the future. Not only that, as the common understanding of this conference: the direction of the health work of the People's Liberation Army is precisely the direction of the national health work in the future. The experience of the health work of the People's Liberation Army is precisely the starting point for the development of the national health work in the future. On the one hand, the health workers of the People's Liberation Army should feel honored to have created this starting point, and on the other hand, they must also recognize that this is only a starting point, and there is a greater cause for us to do, and there are more things for us to learn humbly. There are also good experiences outside the People's Liberation Army that we must absorb. The health workers of the People's Liberation Army should join hands with the national health workers and move forward, carry forward the excellent traditions, and work hard to learn where they are not enough.

In addition, special attention should be paid to strengthening company health work to ensure the health of commanders and fighters, and this should be taken as the base point of military health work.

    关于全国卫生会议的报告   
    （九月八日在中央人民政府政务院第四十九次政务会议上）
    第一次全国卫生会议之召开，是在去年九、十月间军委卫生部召集之卫生行政会议上提出来的。那个会议决定在今年暑期由中央卫生部和军委卫生部联合召集此次会议（所以去年的全国卫生行政会议实际上也就是这次全国卫生会议的准备会议）。那个会议初步地确定全国卫生建设的总方针应是以预防为主，卫生工作的重点应放在保证生产建设和国防建设方面，要面向农村、工矿，依靠群众。这些方针半年来在各大行政区具体执行的结果，证明这些方针基本上是正确的。第一届全国卫生会议的目的，就在于交流和总结过去的经验，讨论和更明确地肯定今后全国卫生建设的总方针，并制定出一些具体办法来保证这一方针的贯彻。
    在会议的筹备过程和会议中我们更深刻地发现了由于我们长期处在帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的重重压迫之下，国民党反动政府素不重视人民健康事业，保健医疗机构简陋，分布不平衡，有的徒有其名，脱离实际，中西医间，西医之间形成了派别分歧，互相倾轧，只为少数人服务，广大农村普遍缺少医药，农民只有求神拜佛，遇有疾病流行，只有听天由命，而我国全人口的发病数累计每年约一亿四千万人，死亡率在千分之三十以上，其中半数以上是死于可以预防的传染病上，如鼠疫、霍乱、麻疹、天花、伤寒、痢疾、班疹伤寒、回归热等为害最大的疾病，而黑热病、日本住血吸虫病、疟疾、麻疯、性病等，也大大侵害着人民的健康，妇女生育绝大多数尚操之于旧接生婆之手，造成了百分之四十左右的婴儿死亡率。
    会议自八月七日开幕，历时十三日（休息一天，参观卫生展览会在内），于十九日闭幕，出席者四二一人，列席者一六一人，其中包括各地区，各军卫生部的负责人和中西医药界名流专家们。会议根据目前我国卫生情况与以预防为主的方针作了深入的讨论，在争取于三五年内健全和发展全国卫生基层组织的基础上，经过商讨统一了在医学教育等问题上的分歧，说服了某些西医对于中医极端的看法，消除了中医的恐惧，达到了协议，确定了“面向工农兵”、“预防为主”、“团结中西医”为卫生工作三大原则，并作出了关于发展医学教育大量培养卫生人才，建立和发展全国基层卫生组织调整卫生部门中公私关系，医药界团结改造，和整顿医院等决议。这说明会议是成功的，这也表明了新中国卫生医药界的新气象。
    兹将这次会议所讨论的几个主要问题作一概括说明：
    一、关于预防为主的方针
    医药是人类与疾病作斗争的科学，参加这一斗争的是人民全体。卫生工作者是这一斗争的先锋，是这一斗争的组织者与领导者。卫生工作者如果不把这种科学，这种斗争方法教给人民，使人民懂得怎样做，自己也动手来做，单靠少数卫生工作者是不能完全解决问题的。过去，卫生工作与群众是隔绝的，因而只有单纯治疗观点。现在，以服务人民大众为前提，不是等待人民有了病来找我们，而是我们主动地发动群众与疾病作斗争。这种主动的斗争必然是以预防为主。所以，以预防为主这一方针，是根据于为人民服务首先为工农兵服务这一出发点而来的。对于卫生工作者本身来说，也唯有认识了这一前提，站稳了这个立场，才能真正做到以预防为主。
    二、关于建立基层卫生组织
    建立全国各级的基层卫生组织，以解决群众的卫生需要，这是实现卫生事业为人民服务，首先为工农兵服务的一个关键任务。我们要给工农兵解决问题，就必须建立基层卫生组织，这个工作是艰巨的，但我们必须努力争取在三五年之内基本上完成这个任务，也就是说使中国大部分的县有两个到七个专科医师、一个药剂师、或调剂员的卫生院组织，逐渐使每个区有一个至两个医士，一个助产士的卫生所组织，工矿街坊也都有卫生组织。这些人员的来源一方面靠学校的培养，一方面靠如前面所说的从大城市的医务人员中加以调整。总之，至少最近几年我们的卫生建设，重点不在大城市，而在中小城市、农村、工矿与部队。
    三、关于教育问题
    旧的医学教育制度在我国四十年来，只培养了不到两万名的正式医师，像这样的教育制度，面对目前实际需要，是绝不能解决问题的。因此首先就要求建立新的医学教育制度，来发展医学教育和大量培养卫生人员。新的医学教育制度应分为高、中、初三级制，并在高级医学教育上实行分科重点制，新的医学教育是以在普及基础上的提高，在提高指导下的普及为方针，而在目前情况就全国范围来说则更应以普及为主。在教学方法上，应以理论与实际相结合。
    四、关于医药界团结和改造的问题
    解放以后，各级政府卫生部门的任务是非常艰巨而光荣的。我们全国卫生人员，包括中西医药人员，必须团结一致，共同努力，才能完成提高人民健康的任务。而过去中西医药界之间存在着隔阂与宗派的纷争现象还是很严重的。因而我们在会议上提出了医药界团结和改造的问题，要求中西医应该在“为人民服务”的目标下团结起来，并进行改造。中西医均应加强政治与业务学习，真正做到“中医科学化”，“西医大众化”。应该责成各大行政区卫生机关，今年先在各大行政区大城市，明年逐步在各省、市有计划地设立中医进修学校或中医训练班，或在现有的中医学校与学会（市医药界联合会）中附办进修学校、训练班、业余学校等。对于私人开办中医学校（或带徒弟）可不加限制，但其课程应酌加基本的科学医学知识和政治知识，其课程标准由中央卫生部拟订，以达到在二、三年内使全国中医大批地获得初步科学训练，作为乡村的医务人才。
    五、关于医药界公私关系的调整
    共同纲领中所指出的公私兼顾的原则，在医药界也同样是应该执行的。由于国家经济还正待恢复，卫生人员医疗机构的分配状况还没有达到适合于广大人民需要的变更，目前在中国公医制还不可能马上实行，私人的医疗业务在今天来说，还是社会所需要的，过去政府卫生部门对私人业务的指导帮助管理尚缺少经验，注意不够，因此许多地区特别是解放时间较短的地区，目前还存在着公私关系不够密切，私人业务有些萧条的现象。这个问题应该有适当的解决。
    为了解决这个问题，首先我们要更好地把私人业务组织起来，对人民卫生的公共事业，要有合理的分工。在防疫保健工作上，在区域负责制的公共卫生事业上，要给私人医院以一定的任务。对其困难的解决，应给以一定的照顾和帮助。在征税问题上，将酌情减免，特别是农村工矿地区应该免除。政府卫生部门，应对私人业务有经常的指导，帮助他们改变作风，改进技术，改善制度，对于少数具有不正当行为——譬如蒙骗病人，以诈取利者当然也应给以制裁。同时私人执业的医务人员本身，也应主动地改变旧作风，学习政治，建立为人民服务的思想，纠正单纯以营利为目的的思想，这样才能有发展有前途。
    六、关于整顿医院的问题
    目前全国各地的医院较解放前已有了初步的改进。但有的工作人员的作风还没有大的转变，认真负责精神不够，技术不高和保守观念重，又加以医疗制度不健全，尚有许多医院发生失职失事的现象。过去我们对此也注意不够，值得检讨。因而整顿医院的问题，是大家一致的要求。要求各医院从思想、技术、制度三方面作一次大检查；并由这三方面来整顿。首先应该改善领导，建立民主集中制的院务委员会。对一切医院人员加强政治思想领导，建立“一切为了伤病员”的思想；其次，健全各种制度，贯彻执行制度。在制定制度时，应想到如何适合病人的需要力求简化手续，认真地进行检诊，护理。再次是提高技术，除了应该加强业务学习外，应建立病案总结会、临床病理研究会。注意消毒，减少并发症。
    七、部队卫生工作
    这个会议是地方卫生工作者与军队卫生工作者一起开的，所以必须说一说部队卫生的工作。面向工农兵，在解放军的卫生工作来说，是二十多年来，一直如此的。解放军卫生工作过去所走的方向是对的，今后将继续按照这个方向走。不但如此，正如此次大会的共同认识一样：解放军的卫生工作方向，正是今后全国卫生工作的方向。解放军卫生工作的经验，正是今后全国卫生工作发展的起点。解放军的卫生工作者一方面要以开创了这个起点而感到光荣，另一方面，也必需认识这只是一个起点，还有更大的事业要我们来做，还有更多的事情要我们虚心学习。还有解放军以外的好的经验，我们还得要吸收。解放军的卫生工作者要与全国卫生工作者交臂并肩，向前迈进，把优良传统，发扬光大，不够的地方，努力学习。
    此外，要特别加强连队卫生工作，以保证指战员健康，把这个作为部队卫生工作的基点。
