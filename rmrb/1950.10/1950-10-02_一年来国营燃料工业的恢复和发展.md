　　Coal production increased by 37 percent; power generation and purchase increased by 30 percent.

　　In the past year, the state-owned fuel industry of New China has basically restored its original scale with key focuses, and has made many significant improvements in enterprise management. According to statistics from the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government: In the past year, coal production increased by 37.35 percent; power generation and purchase increased by 30.7 percent compared with the same period last year, and electricity sales increased by 57.5 percent; taking the Yumen Oil Mine as an example for petroleum, compared with the same period last year, the known oil field area has been expanded by 13 percent through drilling, drilling performance has increased by 45 percent, and crude oil production has increased by 24 percent while maintaining a reasonable oil-gas ratio; in addition to the normal production of the Fengman Hydropower Bureau in Northeast China, some hydropower projects in Fujian, Zhejiang, and Sichuan provinces have also been restored and constructed.

　　Since the establishment of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Fuel Industry has successively convened national professional conferences on coal mines, electricity, petroleum, and hydropower projects. According to the provisions of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the guiding principles and tasks of the fuel industry have been determined: Coal and electricity focus on restoring the old foundation, reforming production methods on the old foundation, improving equipment efficiency, strengthening safety work, and carrying out new construction with emphasis and step-by-step; petroleum and hydropower projects focus on key exploration and gradually restore the old foundation. In the past year, the Central People's Government has invested a considerable amount of funds within the limits of the current national financial resources, and has allocated a considerable number of technicians and cadres to the fuel industry, ensuring the completion of production and construction tasks in the past year.

　　Implement democratic management, abolish feudal foremen, and conduct safety inspections.
　　Learn from Soviet experience to improve production methods.

　　In order to overcome the colonial and corrupt nature left over from imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism in the old enterprises, the Ministry of Fuel Industry has made many important reforms in business management in the past year. The first is to implement a democratic management system, establish factory and mine management committees, and absorb workers to participate in enterprise management. North China, East China, and other places have successively abolished the feudal foreman system in coal mines, which has greatly increased the production enthusiasm of workers. The second is to implement a safety inspection system to ensure production safety. Major safety inspections have been carried out in factories and mines in Northeast China, North China, East China, and Central South China, and accidents involving personal injuries and damage to national resources and property have been reduced. The third is to learn from advanced Soviet technology, improve production methods, maximize the efficiency of existing equipment, and vigorously promote conservation. The new coal mining method being promoted in the coal mine sector has increased the recovery rate of thick coal seams from 30 percent to 65 to 85 percent, thereby extending the life of the mine. In terms of petroleum, crude oil refining technology is being improved to increase gasoline extraction rate and improve product quality. In terms of electricity, due to vigorous development of electricity, adjustment of load curves, and strengthening of maintenance work, the equipment utilization rate has increased from 24.2 percent last year to 28.3 percent this year, and the power generation capacity of the equipment has increased from 65 percent last year to 78.8 percent. The Shijingshan and Fengshan power plants have even increased to 100 percent. As a result of the vigorous promotion of conservation by power plants across the country, the average power consumption of power plants across the country has been reduced to 7.1 percent, a decrease of 14.5 percent compared with last year; line loss has been reduced to 19.4 percent, a decrease of 35 percent compared with last year; and coal consumption has been reduced from 1.039 kg of coal per kilowatt-hour last year to 0.898 kg this year. The Tangshan power plant has even reduced it to 0.577 kg. In total, 210 million kilowatt-hours of electricity consumption and losses have been reduced and 140,000 tons of coal have been saved this year.

　　Production efficiency has increased and costs have generally decreased.

　　Due to the above reforms, the production efficiency of the fuel industry has greatly improved and production costs have also been reduced. Among them, the coal mine production efficiency in Northeast China and North China has reached 0.54 tons per worker, an increase of 25 percent compared with last year. The efficiency of the Hegang Coal Mine has even reached 0.842 tons. For mines that have implemented new coal mining methods, the cost of coal production has been reduced by about 9.3 to 17 percent. Since September, coal prices in North China and East China mines have generally been reduced by more than 20 percent. Since June this year, electricity costs in North China and East China have gradually decreased. Due to the reduction in costs and the stabilization of prices, various electricity prices in North China have been reduced by an average of 8 percent since September, of which the power electricity price has been reduced by 10.5 percent, showing special encouragement for industrial electricity consumption.

　　In order to ensure the balance between production and sales and take care of future construction requirements, the Ministry of Fuel Industry convened a national fuel industry planning meeting in July this year and formulated a scientific production and construction plan. In September, it formulated the outline of the National Fuel Industry Three-Year Development Plan for 1951 to 1953.

### 一年来国营燃料工业的恢复和发展

　　一年来国营燃料工业的恢复和发展
    煤炭生产量提高百分之三十七；发购电量增加百分之三十
    新中国国营燃料工业，一年来已基本上有重点地恢复了原有规模，并在企业经营管理上作了很多重大改进。据中央人民政府燃料工业部的统计：一年来煤炭生产量提高了百分之三十七点三五；发购电量比去年同期提高百分之三十点七，售电量增加了百分之五十七点五；石油以玉门油矿为例，与去年同期作比，其已知油田面积经钻探而扩大百分之十三，打井实绩提高百分之四十五，原油生产量在保持合理的油气比下增加了百分之二十四；水电工业除东北丰满水电局照常生产外，在福建、浙江、四川等省的水电工程亦有若干恢复和建设。
    自中央人民政府成立后，燃料工业部即先后召开了全国性的煤矿、电业、石油、水电工程等专业会议，根据人民政协共同纲领的规定，确定了燃料工业的方针与任务：煤电方面以恢复旧有基础为主，在旧有基础上改革生产方法，提高设备效能，加强保安工作，并有重点有步骤地进行新建设；石油和水电工程以重点探勘为主，逐渐恢复旧有基础。一年以来，中央人民政府在燃料工业方面，曾根据目前国家财政力量的可能投入了相当数量的资金，并调配了相当数目的技术人员和干部，保证了一年来生产修建任务的完成。
    实行民主管理废除封建把头进行保安检查
    学习苏联经验改进生产方法
    为了克服旧企业中帝国主义和官僚资本主义遗留下来的殖民地性与腐败性，燃料工业部一年来在经营管理上作了许多重要的改革。首先是实行民主管理制度，建立了厂矿管理委员会，吸收工人参加企业管理。华北、华东等地已先后在煤矿中废除了封建把头制度，因而大大提高了工人的生产积极性。其次是实行安全检查制度，保障生产安全。东北、华北、华东、中南各厂矿均进行了保安大检查，人身伤亡和损害国家资源与财产的事故业已减少。再次是学习苏联先进技术，改进生产方法，发挥现有设备效能，大力推行节约。煤矿方面正在推行的新采煤方法，使厚煤层的回收率由百分之三十提高到百分之六十五至八十五，并因而延长了矿井寿命。石油方面则正在改进原油制炼技术，增加汽油炼率，提高产品质量。电业方面由于大力开放电力、调整负荷曲线并加强检修工作，设备利用率已由去年的百分之二十四点二提高到今年的百分之二十八点三，设备的发电能力由去年的百分之六十五提高到百分之七十八点八，石景山、凤山等电厂甚至提高到百分之百。各地电厂大力推行节约的结果，使全国电厂的厂用电平均减至百分之七点一，较去年减少百分之十四点五；线路损失减至百分之十九点四，较去年减少百分之三十五；煤耗由去年的每度电用煤一点零三九公斤减至本年的零点八九八公斤，唐山电厂甚至减至零点五七七公斤。总计今年内即减少二亿一千万度的电力消耗和损失，节省了十四万吨的燃煤。
    生产效率提高成本普遍降低
    由于上述各项改革，燃料工业的生产效率已大为提高，生产成本也已降低。其中煤矿生产效率东北、华北已达每工零点五四吨，较去年提高了百分之二十五，鹤冈煤矿效率甚至达到零点八四二吨。凡已实行新采煤方法的矿山，其产煤成本约减低百分之九点三至百分之十七。华北、华东各矿煤价，自九月份起，更普遍降低了百分之二十以上。电业成本自今年六月以来，华北、华东已逐渐降低。由于成本降低，物价稳定，华北各种电价自九月份起已平均降低百分之八，其中电力电价更减低百分之十点五，显示对工业用电的特别鼓励。
    为了保证产销平衡并照顾今后的建设要求，燃料工业部于今年七月召开全国燃料工业计划会议，制订了科学的生产与建设计划。并于九月份制订了一九五一年至五三年全国燃料工业三年发展计划轮廓。
