　　Bumper Harvest in the Shijiazhuang High-Quality Cotton Area

　　"White flowers appear by the fifteenth of July," and now it's the end of the eighth lunar month, right when the second bloom of cotton is being picked. In the suburbs of Shijiazhuang, boundless fields of high-quality cotton stretch as far as the eye can see, with white cotton bolls blooming everywhere. The cotton farmers say with smiles, "We haven't seen such good cotton in years. Coupled with the reasonable price, the cotton everywhere is truly silver flowers."

　　(I) "One Mu of Cotton, Three Mu of Grain"

　　It is estimated that each mu of cotton near Shijiazhuang can yield 250 to 300 jin of seed cotton. Whether at the village entrance, by the fields, or on the way to the market, as long as you talk to the cotton farmers, you will get the same answer: "The cotton is really good this year!" An old man from Dongjia Village said, "I feel happy when I think about my cotton. Although my land was flooded, I can still pick 170 or 180 jin. If it hadn't been flooded, each mu would have yielded at least 200 jin. This is better than planting anything else." Currently, seed cotton is worth over 2,000 yuan per jin on the market, equivalent to more than three jin of millet, and lint cotton is worth around 10,000 yuan per jin, equivalent to twelve jin of millet. Everyone understands the benefit of "one mu of cotton, three mu of grain" from the price.

　　Although there is a lot of cotton on the market, it sells quickly. The exchange, cotton shops, and village markets are all filled with countless cotton bales. Large bags, small bags, large carts, small carts, piles and piles everywhere. But when the market closes, all the cotton is sold at reasonable prices. Many cotton farmers go to the market to buy things, just sell some cotton along the way, and then they can buy other things. An old man who sold cotton, Yan Lao Zeng, said, "Tuck a few jin of cotton in your waist, and you can exchange it for a cart of coal." In market towns, you can often hear the saying, "Cotton is money."

　　Especially since the second bloom started being harvested, there has been a lot of business at the livestock markets and waterwheel factories. After selling their cotton, the cotton farmers go to the livestock market to buy mules and horses, or to the factories to order waterwheels. The liberated farmer Li Lao Gen, stroking the forehead of the big black mule he just bought, said with a smile, "I've been farming for forty years, but I've never raised any livestock. This spring, I listened to the government and planted all my land with cotton. This is the first time I've ever bought livestock. The harvest will get better year by year."

　　"Plant cotton for one year, have surplus grain for one year." For many years, farmers have never had surplus grain. This year's bumper cotton harvest not only means that they plan to improve their food and clothing, but also that they plan to buy livestock and farm tools to develop production. Those who did not plant cotton see the cotton of others and regret it, saying, "Next year, we will all plant cotton, or we won't be able to keep up with others."

　　(II) "Listening to the government on farming is always right."

　　The bumper cotton harvest, especially with the government guaranteeing the stability of cotton prices, leads many farmers to say, "Listening to the government on farming is always right." This lays the ideological foundation for the future development of agricultural production.

　　An old lady at Liuying Market sold eight jin of seed cotton for 18,000 yuan. Counting the money, she said, "This is really good. Eight jin of seed cotton can be exchanged for one dou of rice. No wonder the cadres kept urging people to plant cotton in the spring. At that time, I didn't believe that cotton would be so valuable. I thought the government was afraid that we wouldn't plant cotton, so they used high prices to encourage us. Who knew it was true? In the future, we must listen to the government." Indeed, in the spring, when the government called for planting cotton, some farmers had concerns, fearing that they would not be able to sell the cotton for a good price. This was because farmers suffered a lot in the past under reactionary rule. But today is completely different. Under the leadership of the People's Government, the Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company and the supply and marketing cooperatives have organized purchases to ensure the balance of cotton prices. The Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company frequently goes to rural markets, buying all the unsold cotton if there is too much, so that the cotton farmers do not suffer losses. If there is little cotton in the market, the company will let private buyers buy it first. This not only guarantees the stability of cotton prices but also takes care of the private capital's purchases. A manager of a flower shop said, "The government has truly achieved both public and private benefits, and common development."

　　Whenever a cadre who mobilized a village to plant cotton in the spring returns to that village, he will be warmly and sincerely welcomed. One person says, "You did us a good deed." Another says, "We hated you when you told us to plant cotton! We blamed you when the aphids came! Now that the cotton is growing well, we are really grateful to you!" Indeed, when the call to plant cotton was first made, many people had concerns. When the aphids appeared, many people became pessimistic and disappointed. But with the help of the government, everyone was organized to overcome several pest plagues. District and village cadres went deep into the cotton fields, held forums for old farmers, and brought scientific methods of pest control, which finally eliminated the aphids. Every cotton farmer understands that the government not only calls for planting cotton and guarantees cotton prices, but also stands firmly with them during the cotton's growth, caring about their cotton. So, some cotton farmers said, "When harvesting cotton, we can't forget our government! This year, for the delivery of public grain, as long as the government says the word, even if the cadres are lying there sleeping, we will deliver it all."

　　(III) "Seize the Time and Select Seeds Quickly!"

　　The evidence of the facts has made every cotton farmer understand the benefits of seed selection. Many cotton farmers have seen that the selected Si Zi Er B (斯字二Ｂ) and Si Zi Si B (斯字四Ｂ) cotton varieties have particularly good yields, and have broken the saying that "a bad harvest is due to fate." Li Lao Gen, looking at the selected Si Zi Er B cotton seeds, stroked his beard and said, "Good seeds grow good grain, a good child needs a good mother. This year, we must select seeds well, so that we can compare with others."

　　To do a good job in seed selection, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Government issued instructions on seed selection and cotton harvesting. Each district and village is now, under leadership and in an organized manner, mobilizing village technical groups and cotton-planting models to actively carry out cotton seed selection work. Cadres are being drawn from the Municipal Construction Bureau, farms, the Agricultural University branch, the Municipal Party Committee, the Communist Youth League Municipal Committee, and the Women's Federation to form seed selection shock teams, which are being dispatched to various villages in the suburbs to help with seed selection. The teams are leading the masses to separate harvesting and storage, striving to replace all seeds with improved varieties by 1952. The seed selection shock team members are not only doing propaganda work, but also learning technology and teaching the villagers the technology of seed selection. While everyone is busy picking the second bloom, they are also busy selecting seeds. The blackboard bulletin in Xiwang Village has a large red headline: "Seize the Time and Select Seeds Quickly!" Chen Jin De, a model worker from Datan Village, took the lead in recording and selecting individual plants, selecting more than 200 jin. Other villages are also using various methods such as selecting high-quality seeds for separate harvesting, partially retaining seeds, and selecting individual plants for seed selection. During seed selection, cotton farmers say, "This year, we must select patiently, so that next year's cotton will be even better than this year's. Only then will we be able to live up to the government's concern for us."

　　丰收的石家庄良棉区
    “七月十五见白花”，现在是阴历八月底了，正是棉花摘二喷花的时候。石家庄市郊，一望无边的良种棉田，白色的棉朵遍地盛开。棉农们笑嘻嘻地说：这是多少年没见过的好棉花，加上价格的合适，遍地的棉花真是成了银花了。
    （一）“一亩棉，三亩田”
    在石家庄附近的棉花，估计每亩可收二百五十斤到三百斤籽花，无论在村头、地边，或去赶集的路上，只要和棉农谈起来，便会得到这样的回答：“今年棉花真不错！”董家庄一个老头子说：“提起我的棉花，心里就高兴，我的地虽受了淹，也能摘百七、八十斤，要不淹每亩至少摘它二百来斤，这比种什么都强。”现在市面上籽棉每斤值二千多元，折合小米三斤多，皮棉每斤一万元左右折合小米十二斤，从价钱上大家都体会到“一亩棉，三亩田”的好处。
    棉花在市面上虽然十分多，但很快就能卖出去，交易所、花行、乡村集上，都充塞着无数的棉花。大包、小包，大车、小车，一堆堆一摊摊到处都是。可是当散集的时候，棉花都以合适的价钱卖出去了。很多棉农去市上买东西时，只要拿些棉花顺便卖了，扭头便可以买到别的东西了。一个卖了棉花的老头阎老增说：“腰里掖上几斤花，就能换回一车煤。”在集镇上可以常常听到“棉花就是票子”的话。
    尤其二喷花开始收摘以来，牲口市上、水车工厂成交的生意特别多。棉农卖了花以后，便到牲口市上买骡马，或到工厂定购水车。翻身农民李老根摸着刚买的大青骡子的前额，笑眯眯地说：“作了四十年庄稼，没喂过一根牲口毛；春天听了政府的话，把我的地都种了棉花，这才算第一次买了牲口。以后的庄稼会一年比一年更强。”
    “种一年棉，余一年粮。”多少年来，农民从来没有过余粮，今年棉花的丰收，不仅打算吃穿要改善一下，而且准备置买牲口、农具、发展生产。那些没有种棉花的人看见别人的棉花便后悔地说：“明年都种上棉花，要不然就赶不上人家的光景了。”
    （二）“听着政府的话种庄稼，保险没错。”
    棉花的丰收，尤其政府保证了棉价的平稳，很多农民在一起谈话时便说：“听着政府的话种庄稼，保险没错。”这就给未来的发展农业生产打下了思想基础。
    留营集上一个老太太，八斤籽棉卖了一万八千块钱，一边数着票子一边说：“这倒不错，八斤籽棉就可换一斗米，怨不得春天时干部们一个劲地劝人种棉花，那时不信棉花会这样值钱，以为政府怕咱不种棉花，拿多卖钱来动员咱，谁知道是真事，以后可得好好听政府的话。”的确，在春天政府号召种棉时，少数农民是存在着顾虑的，怕种了棉花卖不出钱。这是由于过去在反动统治时期，农民吃了许多亏：但今天是完全不同了，在人民政府领导下面，花纱布公司、供销社等有组织的收购，保证了棉价的平衡。花纱布公司经常深入到乡村集市，集上花多卖不完就全数收购，不使棉农受到损失；集上货少，公司就先让私人买。这样就不仅保证了棉价的平稳，而且照顾了私人资本的收购。一个花店的经理说：“政府真是作到了公私兼顾，共同发展。”
    只要那个干部，今年春天在某一个村动员过种棉花，现在他又到那个村里去时，他便会受到热情地、真诚地招待。这个说：“你给我们作了好事。”那个说：“你叫种花时恨你！生了蚜虫怨你！现在棉花长好了实在感谢你！”的确，在刚号召种棉时，不少的人有顾虑；生了蚜虫时，很多人产生了悲观失望的情绪，但在政府的帮助下，组织大家战胜了几次虫灾。区村干部深入到棉田，召开了老农座谈会，带着科学的治虫方法，才消灭了蚜虫。每一个棉农的心里都懂得：政府不仅号召种棉，保证棉价，而在棉花的生长中，也是紧紧的和他们站在一起，关心着他们的棉花。所以有的棉农说：“收棉花可不能忘了咱政府呀！今年交公粮，只要政府说一声，干部们躺在那里睡觉，我们就送齐了。”
  （三）“抓紧时间快选种！”
    经过事实的证明，使每个棉农都明白了选种的好处。很多棉农看见了选种的斯字二Ｂ和斯字四Ｂ棉收成特别好，便打破了“庄稼不好是天年的过”的说法。李老根看着人家选好的斯字二Ｂ棉种，便摸着胡子说：“好籽长好粮，好孩要好娘。今年一定要好好选种，才能和别人比得上。”
    为了作好选种工作，石家庄市府发出了选种收花指示，各区村正在有领导有组织地发动各村技术小组、植棉模范，积极进行棉花选种工作；并由市建设局、农场、农大分校、市委、团市委、妇联各单位抽调干部，组织了选种突击队，分赴郊区各村帮助选种。领导群众分收分存，争取一九五二年全部换成良种。选种突击队员，不仅作宣传工作，而且学了技术，教会老乡选种的技术。各村正在摘二喷花的时候，忙着选种。西王村的黑板报上写着：“抓紧时间快选种”的红字大标题。大谈村劳模陈金德，首先带头记棵选种，选了二百多斤。其他各村也正在采用着选良分收，局部留种、株选等各种方法进行选种。在选种中，棉农们说：“今年要耐心的选，要叫明年的棉花比今年更强，这才对得住政府对我们的关心。”
