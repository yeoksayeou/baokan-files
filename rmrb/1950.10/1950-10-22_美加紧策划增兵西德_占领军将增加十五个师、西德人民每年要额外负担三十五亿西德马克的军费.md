　　Xinhua News Agency, 20th. Following the US announcement of increasing its troops stationed in West Germany, plans are now being accelerated. According to a report from the German News Agency: Sources within the West German puppet government revealed that West German Chancellor Adenauer announced in the Foreign Affairs Committee that the occupation forces stationed in West Germany would be increased by fifteen divisions, and therefore the Bonn government must allocate an additional 3.5 billion West German Marks annually for occupation expenses.

　　Furthermore, according to Agence France-Presse, Frankfurt: The US High Commissioner for West Germany, McCloy, delivered a radio address in Frankfurt on the 9th of this month, publicly declaring: "The troops dispatched by the US, Britain, and France to West Germany will be stationed in various locations according to strategic needs, without considering the boundaries of each zone." The German News Agency points out that McCloy's statement "not only means that the entire West German territory will now be placed under direct US colonial control, but also enables the US to distribute the occupation forces of Britain, France, and other satellite countries along the border of the German Democratic Republic and the Rhine and Ruhr industrial areas."

　　The German News Agency also reported that the US military is driving thousands of Germans out of their homes in order to provide housing for the occupation forces. The largest concentration of troops will be in Düsseldorf, where all residential areas and hospitals have been vacated. The people of Hamburg are also being forced to give up their homes to accommodate the families of three thousand British soldiers.

　　In West Berlin, according to Agence France-Presse, a US Army Department spokesperson in Washington announced on the 14th that the 6th Infantry Regiment would arrive in West Berlin by early 1951. The same source revealed that the total number of US troops currently in Europe is 97,000, of which approximately 10,000 are stationed in Austria, with the remainder stationed in West Germany.

　　美加紧策划增兵西德
    占领军将增加十五个师、西德人民每年要额外负担三十五亿西德马克的军费
    【新华社二十日讯】美国前宣布增加其西德驻军一事，现正在加紧策划中。据德意志通讯社消息：西德傀儡政府人士透露：西德总理阿登纳曾在外交事务委员会中宣布驻西德的占领军将增加十五个师，因此波恩政府每年必须额外拨付占领费三十五亿西德马克。
    另据法新社法兰克福消息：美国驻西德高级专员麦克洛埃曾于本月九日在法兰克福发表广播演说，公开声称：“美、英、法增派往西德的部队将按战略上的需要分驻各处，而不考虑各区的界限。”麦克洛埃这一声明，据电通社指出：“不仅意味着整个西德领土现在将置于美国直接殖民地管制之下，并且使美国能够把英、法和其他卫星国的占领军分布于德意志民主共和国的边界和莱茵与鲁尔工业区。”
    电通社并报道说：美军正在把成千上万的德国人赶出他们的家宅，以便把房子让给占领军住。最大的军队集中点将是杜塞尔多夫，该地所有的住宅区与医院都已腾出来。汉堡的人民也被迫让出房子给三千名英军的家属居住。
    西柏林方面，据法新社消息，华盛顿美陆军部发言人已于十四日宣布步兵第六团将于一九五一年初以前开抵西柏林。同一消息透露：目前美国在欧洲的军队总数为九万七千人，除其中约一万驻在奥地利外，其余均驻在西德。
