Xinhua News Agency, 30th. Following Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government Zhou Enlai's telegram to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Trygve Lie, the President of the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, Nasrollah Entezam, and the President of the Security Council, Philip Charles Jessup, on the 24th, regarding the renewed bombing of our territory of Andong by U.S. invading military aircraft, the U.S. government, recognizing the irrefutable evidence, had no choice but to admit the crime through its Deputy Representative to the Security Council, Gross, in a letter to Lie on the 26th. However, in the letter, Gross revealed the U.S. government's attempt to portray these increasingly provocative actions as an "unfortunate mistake," to evade our government's solemn accusation to the United Nations, and to conceal its aggressive intention to expand the war in the East, as clearly pointed out by our Foreign Minister Zhou.

Although Gross openly admitted in the letter: "I have now received a report from the U.S. Air Force indicating that on the evening of September 22nd, a U.S. Air Force aircraft serving with the United Nations may have inadvertently violated Chinese territory and dropped bombs near Andong." However, Gross then requested a so-called "on-the-spot investigation" into this fact, which he himself clearly admitted and for which the responsibility was beyond doubt. Gross shamelessly said: "My government believes that such an investigation is entirely reasonable and an important prerequisite for determining responsibility and assessing damages." This means that the U.S. government is attempting to send its agents to China under the guise of an "on-the-spot investigation" to conduct espionage activities, while using this as a "prerequisite" to reject our government's solemn accusation.

In the letter, Gross hypocritically stated: "We have made, and are continuing to make, every effort to avoid unfortunate incidents of the nature alleged. The U.S. representative has notified the United Nations Security Council that the air force under the command of the Unified Command in Korea has been instructed to strictly prohibit crossing the Korean border into neighboring countries' airspace." However, the Chinese people clearly remember that Gross's superior, the Chief Representative of the United States to the Security Council, Austin, had as early as August 29th and August 31st, emphatically emphasized the so-called "strict instructions issued by the Korean military authorities." The U.S.'s "notifications" and "guarantees" have proven to be worthless and are merely a smokescreen for yet another act of aggression.

　　美政府无法抵赖罪行承认飞机再炸我领土
    【新华社三十日讯】我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长于二十四日就美国侵朝军用飞机再次轰炸我国领土安东一事致电联合国秘书长赖伊、联合国第五届大会主席安迪让及安全理事会主席杰伯，控诉美国罪行以后，美国政府鉴于罪证确凿，无可抵赖，已不得不经由其驻安理会副代表葛罗斯于二十六日致函赖伊，承认上项罪行。但是葛罗斯在信中暴露，美国政府企图把美国这种有增无已的挑衅行动说成是一个“不幸的错误”，以逃避我国向联合国提出的严正控诉，并掩盖其已为我周外长所明确指出的扩大东方战争的侵略意图。
    葛罗斯虽然在信中公开承认：“我现在收到美国空军的一份报告，报告指明九月二十二日晚间为联合国服役的美国空军飞机一架可能因疏忽而侵犯了中国领土，并且在安东附近投弹。”但是葛罗斯接着却要求对这一已为他自己所明白承认、责任无可怀疑的事实进行所谓“实地调查”。葛罗斯无耻地说：“我国政府认为这样的一个调查是完全合理的，而且是判明责任和估定损失的重要先决条件”。这就是说，美国政府企图在“实地调查”的掩护下，派遣其代理人到中国来进行其间谍活动，同时以此为“先决条件”，借以拒绝我国的严正控诉。
    葛罗斯在信中假惺惺地表示：“我们已经进行了，而且还在进行着种种努力，避免被指控的这种性质的不幸事件。美国代表已通知联合国安全理事会：在朝鲜的统一司令所指挥的空军，受到严禁越过朝鲜边境进入邻国领空的训示。”但是，中国人民清楚地记得，葛罗斯的上司、美国驻安理会首席代表奥斯汀早在八月二十九日与八月三十一日的声明中就曾信誓旦旦地强调过所谓“朝鲜军事当局已发出严格训令”的鬼话。美国的“通知”、“保证”，已证明一钱不值，而仅仅是再一次侵略行为的烟幕。
