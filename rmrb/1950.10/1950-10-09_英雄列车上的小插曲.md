An Episode on the Hero Train
    Hu Feng
    I was awakened. The sky was still dark.
    Getting up from the toilet, I suddenly heard a "thump!" sound. Looking down, I saw a notebook by my feet. I quickly felt my pockets and found that the button was not fastened, and both hardcover notebooks were gone. I picked up the one by my feet, but the other was nowhere to be found; it had fallen down the drain. I immediately woke up, and a feeling of "What a pity!" flashed through my mind. That notebook contained some odds and ends, such as the names of people I had met in the past year or so, as well as technical terms and numbers I had heard from model workers, which I might need to look up sometimes. Now it was completely lost. It felt like losing a bag filled with emotions.
    Returning to the carriage, two fellow travelers were talking by the window. After a while, one of them looked out the window and said: Yangliuqing! We've passed Yangliuqing!
    Passing through the carriages of the model heroes, I sat down next to the chief leader, Comrade Zhao Yuhua. After hesitating for a while, I told him what had happened. He asked the train conductor to come and discuss whether he could make a phone call to the station behind us from Tianjin Station, asking them to send someone to look along the tracks. I said I wanted to give the person who helped look for it some cigarette money. Comrade Zhao Yuhua interjected and said: We'll pay for the money! I also rushed to take out my wallet.
    But the conductor waved his hand, saying, No need! After asking about the size and appearance of the notebook, he readily agreed.
    It's really not right to bother people with such a small matter! Moreover, I couldn't figure out how many minutes ago it had happened, and I didn't even know if that Yangliuqing seen by the fellow traveler was really Yangliuqing...
    The next day, I boarded the train at the East Station. Before the farewell party, I went to the station office. I had felt uneasy since asking the conductor yesterday, but since I had already asked, I had no choice but to ask now. I didn't think it would be found.
    After listening, an employee immediately led me to a young employee in another office. After listening, he grabbed the phone. He said to the other end: Wasn't there a model worker who lost a notebook? ... After hanging up, he asked me if the notebook had a name written on it? Was the cover wrapped in kraft paper? ... He said: Such a notebook has been found. Please go to the North Station to pick it up.
    It was actually found. I felt unexpectedly surprised.
    Before arriving at the North Station, a young attendant walked past the seat; I asked him to tell the conductor. He immediately said enthusiastically that there was no need to find the conductor, and if it was found, he could find someone to claim it.
    When the train arrived at the North Station, there was another crowded farewell crowd. I stood by the train door as the train slowly stopped. The attendant quickly walked over from the front of the train. As soon as he saw me, he greeted me happily, as if saying: Don't worry, I won't forget! Coincidentally, standing in front of the farewell crowd, slightly behind the train door, were two station employees. One of them stepped forward and asked him: The station found a notebook...
    I took it, feeling as if a force flowed into my body along with the notebook, and said hesitantly: I want to give you some cigarette money... The employee rushed to say: No! No!
    His attitude was very polite, but I immediately felt as if I had been electrocuted: I can't say anything about cigarette money. This is equivalent to insulting the new employees of the people's railway! I knew that if relying on the power of money, this notebook would never be found...
    After the national combat hero representatives and labor model representatives met in Fengtai, they were led by the "Mao Zedong" locomotive towards Beijing.
    Amidst the enthusiastic applause, music, and slogans, the train started.
    The young attendant, full of energy, walked into the carriage, raised the loudspeaker, and suddenly his voice rang out (the gist):
    "Comrade combat heroes, comrade labor models! We are very honored to accept this task of sending you to Beijing. We are very excited and will definitely do our best to complete this glorious task well! ..."
    It was a loud voice, and a radiant glow shone on his young face, emanating a sense of happiness. As soon as his voice stopped, the entire carriage erupted in a crisp and orderly round of applause...
    As the applause subsided, the train's magnificent sound of progress poured in, as if a heroic symphony was waiting to begin formally only after hearing his report. The happy young attendant walked past the seats of the combat heroes and labor models, full of energy.

　　英雄列车上的小插曲
    胡风
    被叫醒了。天空还是乌黑的。
    从便池上站起来，突然听见“拍—塌！”一声。低头一看，脚边有一个本子，赶快摸一摸口袋，扣子没有扣，两个硬壳本子都没有了。把脚边一个捡了起来，另一个不见踪影，是从便道孔掉下去了。人马上清醒了，同时，一道“可惜！”的感觉在脑子里闪过。那个本子里记了一些零碎的东西，例如一年多以来见到的人名字以及从劳动模范们听来的技术上的名词和数字之类，也许有时候要查一查的。现在是完全丢掉了。好像丢掉了一个装感情的袋子。
    回到车厢，有两位同行者在靠着窗边谈话。过了一会，一位向窗外望了一望，说：杨柳青！杨柳青过去了！
    穿过英模们的车厢，我在总领队赵毓华同志的身边坐下了。踌躇了好一会，但还是告诉了他。他请来了列车长，和他商量，看能不能在天津站打个电话到后面的站上去，托站上派人在路轨上看一看。我说，要送帮忙找的人一点香烟钱。赵毓华同志对我抢着说：钱由我们出！我也抢着拿出了皮夹子。
    但列车长张手推了一把，说，用不着！问明了本子的大小和样子，爽快地答应了。
    这点小事要麻烦人，真不应该！而且，我又弄不清这是在多少分钟以前发生的，而且，那位同行者所看见的杨柳青也不知道是不是真是杨柳青……
    第二天在东站上车，欢送会之前我到站上办公室去。昨天托了列车长以后就感到不安，但既然托了，现在只好去问一问。我觉得决不会找到的。
    一位职员听了以后，马上把我引到另一办公室的一位青年职员那里。他听了以后就抓起了电话。他对对方说：不是有一位劳模丢了一个笔记本子吗？……放了电话以后，他问我，本子上写了名字没有？是不是封面用牛皮纸包的？……他说：是捡到了这样一个本子，请到北站上去取。
    居然找到了，觉得出乎意外。
    到北站之前，一位青年乘务员从车座旁边走过；我托了他，请他向列车长说一声。他马上热心地说，用不着找列车长，如果有了，他就可以找人领到的。
    车到北站，又是拥挤的欢送的行列。我站在车门旁边，车在慢慢地停下了。刚才那位乘务员快步从车头那边走了过来，一看见我就高兴地打着招呼，好像说：放心，我不会忘记的！恰巧，正在车门偏后一点的欢送行列前面，站着两位车站职员，一位走上一步问他：站上捡到了一个本子……
    我接了过来，感到似乎有一股力量随着本子流到了我的身上，惶惑地说：要送一点香烟钱……。那位职员抢着似地说：不要！不要！
    他的态度很客气，但我马上触电似地感到了：不能说什么香烟钱的，这等于侮辱了人民铁路上的新职工！我知道，如果靠钱的力量，这个本子是永远找不到的。………
    全国战斗英雄代表和劳动模范代表在丰台会师了以后，由毛泽东号引导着向北京前进。
    在热烈的掌声、乐声、口号声中间，列车开动了。
    刚才那位青年乘务员精神饱满地走进了车厢，举起喇叭筒来，突然地响起了他的声音（大意）：
    “诸位战斗英雄，诸位劳动模范！我们非常光荣地接受了这个任务，把诸位送到北京去。我们非常兴奋，一定要用全力很好地把这个光荣的任务完成！………”
    是洪亮的声音，年青的脸上放着红光，散出一片幸福的采色。他的声音一停止，整个车厢爆发起来一阵清脆而整齐的掌声………。
    掌声停止了，列车的宏大的前进的声音就涌了进来，好像一只英雄交响曲等着听了他的报告以后这才正式开始了的。这位幸福的青年乘务员从战斗英雄和劳动模范的车座当中精神饱满地走了过去。
        （一九五○，十月四日，北京）
