　　Beijing Construction Bureau Brick Kiln Second Factory
    Should Promptly Address the Foreman's Wage Deduction Incident

Editor:
    After the People's Garden published the incident on October 7th regarding Su Deshun, a foreman at the Second Factory of the Beijing Construction Bureau Brick Kiln, using his position to deduct wages, we immediately convened all employees for group discussions. We believe that such incidents cannot be tolerated now that the people are in charge. We demand that the Beijing Construction Bureau thoroughly investigate this incident to eradicate the evil foreman system.

    Regarding this matter, we have the following opinions:

    (1) Su Deshun's job is to lead construction work, so why does the payroll have to go through him? Has the accounting system not been established? This shows that the factory's system is chaotic, creating opportunities for the foreman to exploit the workers.

    (2) The leaders' thinking is paralyzed, their bureaucratic style is serious, and they rely on the foreman to do everything without principle. When the situation becomes serious, the leaders are completely unaware. This shows that the leaders are detached from the masses.

    (3) Judging from the above facts, the factory workers do not have their own sound organization, and there are no systems for rationalization proposals, etc.

    We hope that the factory will promptly convene a workers' congress to properly handle this issue and publish the handling process in the newspaper.

### 京市建设局砖窑二分厂  应迅速处理领工克扣工资事件

　　京市建设局砖窑二分厂
    应迅速处理领工克扣工资事件编辑同志：
    十月七日人民园地发表了京市建设局砖窑厂二分厂领工苏德顺利用职权克扣工资的事件后，我们马上召集了全体职工分组详加讨论。我们认为在人民已当了家的今天，不能容许这样的事件。要求京市建设局立即彻查这一事件，以根除罪恶的把头制度。
    对于这件事情，我们有如下的意见：
    （一）苏德顺的职务是领导工务工作，为什么发薪要经过他的手呢？会计制度没有建立起来吗？由此可见，该厂制度紊乱，造成了领工剥削工人的机会。
    （二）领导人的思想麻痹，官僚作风严重，无原则地依靠领工包办代替。事态严重时，领导上竟茫然不知。这说明领导者是脱离群众的。
    （三）从以上事实看来，该厂工人没有自己的健全组织，没有合理化建议等制度。
    我们希望该厂迅速召开工友大会，很好的处理这一问题，并将处理经过在报上发表。
              卫生工程局制砖厂工会主任  毕利吉
