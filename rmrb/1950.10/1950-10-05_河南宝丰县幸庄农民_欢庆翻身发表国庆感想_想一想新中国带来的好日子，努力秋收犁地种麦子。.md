　　Henan Baofeng County Xingzhuang Peasants
    Celebrate Liberation and Express National Day Sentiments
    Thinking About the Good Life Brought by the New China, Striving for Autumn Harvest and Plowing to Plant Wheat.
    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Henan Daily: Before National Day, peasants in Xingzhuang Village, Baofeng County, held a mass meeting, where the masses expressed their feelings about celebrating National Day. The village is home to sixty or seventy households. During the rule of the Kuomintang government, the peasants suffered cruel oppression and exploitation by the township chiefs and local tyrants. Only after the arrival of the People's Liberation Army were they liberated. Especially since the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1st last year, land reform has been implemented, and landless peasants have been allocated land, while peasants with insufficient land have received certain supplements; those without housing have also been allocated houses, and the vast majority of peasants have received some farming tools. They began to cultivate their own land diligently, and both the wheat and autumn harvests this year have been good. Looking at today and thinking about the past, the peasants clearly know that the good life they have now is brought by the New China. Therefore, at the mass meeting of the whole village, when the district cadres asked how to welcome and celebrate National Day, everyone began to discuss it enthusiastically. A poor peasant first stated: "We must not forget this day. It is since October 1st last year that we truly have a Central People's Government that represents us, the common people, leading us in land reform and production. When we fought against the local tyrants, I didn't dare to accept the compensation they paid, but after the celebration meeting for the founding of the People's Republic of China was held in the district last year, I felt relieved and had support. This year is better than last year, and next year will be even better. In the future, we must work hard on farming to support the liberation of Taiwan." Middle peasant Wang Laoliu said: "After the founding of the People's Republic, I didn't get land in the land reform in January of this year, but I am no longer oppressed by the local tyrants and landlords. Under the leadership of the government, we are engaged in production, producing more grain and contributing more public grain. Production will become stronger day by day!" Communist Party member Zhu Junzheng said: "Since the establishment of the Central People's Government, and from this spring until now, prices have not been rising sharply, and we are no longer suffering losses. How do we welcome October 1st? We villagers have no other ability, but we know how to farm. Chairman Mao also likes the hard work of farming. I think we should harvest the autumn crops well, plow and harrow the autumn fields well, and plant wheat well to celebrate!" Youth League member Yu Xihai said: "I want to take the lead in production and plant next year's crops better than this year!"
    At the meeting, the peasants all expressed their desire to step up production in order to respond to Chairman Mao's call to "strive for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation" and to first plant this year's wheat well.

　　河南宝丰县幸庄农民
    欢庆翻身发表国庆感想
    想一想新中国带来的好日子，努力秋收犁地种麦子。
    【本报讯】据河南日报消息：宝丰县幸庄农民国庆节前曾举行群众大会，在会上群众纷纷发表了庆祝国庆的感想。该庄是一个六、七十户人家的村庄，在国民党政府统治时期，农民们受着乡保长和恶霸地主的残酷压迫和剥削。解放军来后，他们才得到解放。特别是从去年十月一日中华人民共和国成立以来，实行了土地改革，无地农民都分到了土地，缺地农民也得到一定的补充；没有房屋住的人也分到了房屋，广大农民都分得了一部分农具。他们开始在自己的土地上深耕细作，今年的麦、秋两季收成都好。农民们看看今天，想想过去，他们清楚的知道，如今的好日子是新中国带来的，所以在全村群众大会上，当区干部提出如何迎接国庆、庆祝国庆后，大家就非常热烈地讨论起来。一个贫农首先提出：“咱们可不要忘了这个日子，就是从去年十月一日起，才真正有了咱们老百姓当家的中央人民政府，领着咱们土改、生产。在反恶霸时，恶霸赔偿的东西我还不敢要，去年在区上开过庆祝中华人民共和国成立会后，我才放心，有了靠山。今年日子比去年好，明年就会更好。今后要好好做庄稼，支援解放咱台湾。”中农王老留说：“人民共和国成立后，今年一月经过土改，虽说我没有分地，可不受恶霸地主们压迫了。在政府领导下搞生产，多打粮食多出公粮，生产就要一天比一天强！”共产党员朱君正说：“从有了中央人民政府以后，从今年春上到现在物价也不往上直涨啦，咱们不再吃亏了，我们用什么来迎接十月一日呢——乡下人没有别的能力，就会做庄稼，毛主席也喜欢下力做庄稼这事，我看就把秋庄稼收好，把秋地犁耙好，好好种上麦子来庆祝吧！”青年团员余喜孩说：“我要带头生产，把明年的庄稼种的比今年更好！”
    会中，农民都表示要加紧生产，为响应毛主席“为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争”的号召，先要种好今年的麦子。
