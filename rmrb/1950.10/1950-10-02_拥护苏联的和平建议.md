Supporting the Soviet Union's Peace Proposals
    Editor's Note: On the morning of September 24th, a mass rally of 50,000 young people was held in the Hall of Supreme Harmony, Beijing, to welcome the delegation of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting. The following is the full text of his speech. The title was added by the editor.

    Today we welcome the delegation of the World Federation of Democratic Youth in Beijing. At the same time, it is a great unity of Chinese democratic youth, a great unity of democratic youth all over the world, and a great unity of the progressive forces of all mankind.

    We must first express our congratulations on this historic event, pay our highest respects to the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and pay our highest respects to the representatives of the delegation!

    Although our clothing styles are different, our skin colors are different, and our language tones are different, we only have one heart: to oppose imperialist wars of aggression, to defend lasting peace throughout the world, and to strive for the common security and happiness of all mankind. These are also our common languages.

    The world has long been divided into two opposing camps, one is the democratic peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the other is the aggression camp headed by American imperialism.

    Today, the opposition between these two camps is even more obvious. The warmongers of American imperialism and the group of robbers they have coerced have progressed from the stage of conspiring to instigate war to the stage of actually carrying out wars of aggression.

    Today we are holding a welcome meeting here, welcoming our peace fighters, but we all know that at the same moment, American planes must be bombing Pyongyang, Seoul, and Pohang.

    The Korean people, especially the Korean youth, are heroically waging a just war against aggression. They are not only fighting for the independence and freedom of their motherland, but also for world peace and security.

    Today we have Korean youth representatives among our guests, and we should pay special respects to the Korean representatives. We should protest against the aggression of American imperialism in the name of progressive youth all over the world, and support the just war of the Korean people with practical actions. We should shout in unison: All aggressors get out of Korea.

    At the same time, in these few days, the Fifth General Assembly of the United Nations is being held on Success Lake. Three days ago, the Soviet representative Vyshinsky had already submitted a plan for establishing lasting peace to the conference: 1. Condemn some countries for engaging in propaganda for new wars, and demand punishment for this criminal act; 2. Unconditionally prohibit the use of atomic weapons, establish strict international control, and declare the first user to be a war criminal; 3. The five major powers of the United States, Britain, France, China, and the Soviet Union conclude a peace treaty and reduce armaments by one-third within this year.

    This is a proposal that conforms to the common requirements of all mankind. It is the insistence of the Soviet Union's consistent peace policy and has enriched the Stockholm Peace Appeal even more. We must thoroughly support the Soviet Union's peace policy and thoroughly support Vyshinsky's proposal.

    But we know that the United Nations is now under the control of the British and American imperialist groups, and the Soviet Union's peace proposals will inevitably be hindered in various ways. The first obvious evidence is that the representatives of our People's Republic of China, who are the only representatives of the Chinese people and thoroughly support peace, are being shunned by the American imperialist group and are unable to attend.

    However, even if people with eye diseases close their eyes and dare not look directly at the sun, the sun is still shining brightly, illuminating all directions. The sun will never reduce its brilliance or its heat for the sake of eye patients!

    No matter how the warmongers obstruct the Soviet Union's peace policy, the kind people all over the world who love peace and justice will definitely thoroughly support it. This is an irresistible force to eliminate wars of aggression!

    Progressive youth of the whole of China, unite, strengthen our peace forces, and stop the imperialist wars of aggression!

    Progressive youth of the whole world, unite, strengthen our peace forces, and stop the imperialist wars of aggression!

    Long live the World Federation of Democratic Youth!

    Long live the victory of lasting peace in the world!

### 拥护苏联的和平建议

　　拥护苏联的和平建议
    编者按：九月二十四日上午，首都青年在太和殿举行了一个五万人的群众大会，欢迎世界青年联盟代表团。中国保卫世界和平大会委员会主席郭沫若在会上致欢迎词。下面是他的演词的全文。题目是编者所加的。
    今天我们在北京欢迎世界民主青年联盟代表团，这同时是我们中国民主青年的大团结，全世界民主青年的大团结，全人类进步的方生力量的大团结。
    我们首先要为这一历史事件表示庆贺，向世界民主青年联盟致崇高的敬礼，向代表团的代表们致崇高的敬礼！
    尽管我们的服装的样式不同，皮肤的颜色不同，语言的音调不同，但我们只有一条心：反对帝国主义的侵略战争，保卫全世界的持久和平，争取全人类的共同安全和幸福。这些也就是我们共通的言语。
    全世界早就划成了两个对立的阵营，一边是以苏联为首的民主和平阵营，另一边是以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营。
    今天这两个阵营的对立是更加明显了。美帝国主义的战争贩子们和他们所裹胁的一群强盗集团已经由阴谋挑拨战争的阶段，进展到实际进行侵略战争的阶段。
    今天我们在这儿开欢迎会，欢迎我们的和平斗士，但我们都知道，就在这同一时刻，美国的飞机一定正在轰炸平壤、汉城、浦项。
    朝鲜人民，尤其朝鲜青年，正在英勇地进行着反侵略的正义战争。他们不但是在为祖国的独立自由而战，而同时是在为世界的和平与安全而战。
    今天我们的客人中有朝鲜的青年代表，我们应该向朝鲜代表特别表示敬礼。我们应该用全世界进步青年的名义抗议美帝国主义的侵略，用实际行动来支援朝鲜人民的正义战争。我们应该一致高呼：一切侵略者滚出朝鲜去。
    同时，就在这几天，成功湖正在开着联合国第五届大会。在三天前苏联的代表维辛斯基已经向大会提出了建立持久和平的方案：一、谴责一些国家从事新战争的宣传，并要求惩办这种罪恶行为，二、无条件禁止原子武器的使用，建立严格的国际管制，并宣布首先使用者为战争罪犯；三、美英法中苏五大国缔结和平公约，并在本年内裁减军备三分之一。
    这正是合乎全人类共同要求的建议，是苏联一贯的和平政策的坚持，把斯德哥尔摩的和平宣言更加充实了。我们要彻底拥护苏联的和平政策，并彻底拥护维辛斯基的建议。
    但是我们知道，联合国现在是美英帝国主义集团的操纵之下，对于苏联的和平建议一定是要加以种种阻挠的。首先一个显明的证据，便是唯一代表中国人民、彻底拥护和平的我们中华人民共和国的代表遭受着美帝国主义集团的忌避，不能够出席。
    然而尽管害了眼病的人，闭着眼睛不敢正视太阳，太阳依然光芒万丈，照耀着四面八方。太阳决不会为了眼病患者减少他一点光辉，减少他一点热量！
    尽管战争贩子们怎样阻挠苏联的和平政策，全世界爱好和平正义的善良人们是一定彻底拥护的，这是不可抗拒的消灭侵略战争的力量！
    全中国的进步青年团结起来，加强我们的和平力量，制止帝国主义的侵略战争！
    全世界的进步青年团结起来，加强我们的和平力量，制止帝国主义的侵略战争！
    世界民主青年联盟万岁！
    全世界持久和平胜利万岁！
