　　On the Exchange of Goods Between Urban and Rural Areas and the Price Parity of Industrial and Agricultural Products
    Yang Bo
    I. The Importance of Material Exchange Between Urban and Rural Areas
    "Mutual assistance between urban and rural areas" is one of the fundamental policies of our New Democratic economic construction. The concrete realization of the "mutual assistance between urban and rural areas" policy is how to promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and to achieve the rapid recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production through the smooth circulation of industrial products and agricultural products between urban and rural areas.
    In capitalist countries, capitalist production is where the city dominates the countryside, and the city exploits the countryside. The law of capitalist development is also: big capital dominates small capital, and big capital exploits small capital. Urban industrial and commercial capitalists rely on their strong capital to control the market and manipulate prices; the vast number of rural farmers, due to their dispersion and poverty, often have the prices of their agricultural products manipulated by urban industrial and commercial capitalists, who exploit the vast number of farmers through unequal exchanges. Under the capitalist system, there is this relationship of domination and exploitation between urban and rural areas; generally, industry develops faster, while agriculture develops more slowly. Capitalists not only exploit workers, but also the vast number of farmers. Similarly, because agricultural production is relatively backward, the supply of grain and raw materials cannot meet the needs of industrial development, so it is necessary to plunder abroad and seek sources of raw materials and grain; on the other hand, also because agricultural production is relatively backward, the purchasing power of farmers is low, and industrial products cannot be sold, so it is necessary to find sales markets abroad. Therefore, in capitalist countries, domination and exploitation of the countryside by the city develops into domination and exploitation of agricultural countries by industrial countries, that is, domination and exploitation of colonial and semi-colonial countries by imperialist countries. The old China's urban-rural exchange relationship was manipulated by imperialists, bureaucratic bourgeoisie, feudal landlords and speculative merchants, who cruelly exploited the vast number of farmers and millions of handicraft producers in the exchange of industrial and agricultural products.
    But today, the urban-rural relationship under our New Democratic regime is completely different. It is neither establishing a capitalist urban-rural relationship, nor maintaining the old Chinese urban-rural relationship, but rebuilding a new relationship of "both urban and rural areas being taken into consideration" and "mutual assistance between urban and rural areas," so that cities and villages, workers and farmers, industry and agriculture are closely linked together. It is the city leading the countryside, but we must never abandon the countryside and only care for the city. On the one hand, we must develop industry, and on the other hand, we must develop agriculture. In the past, when we had not yet occupied the cities, the primary task was to develop agriculture; and now that all the large, medium and small cities on the mainland have been liberated by us, we must pay attention to the recovery and development of industry, but developing industry does not mean relaxing the development of agriculture. Similarly, agriculture must continue to develop. Because the development of industry requires a sufficient supply of raw materials and grain, which requires the development of agriculture. At present, our national grain supply is not very abundant. Whenever there is a serious disaster, we feel that the grain supply is insufficient. The production of major industrial raw materials such as cotton and flax is even more insufficient. Grain production must be increased, and cotton and flax production must also be increased, so only by improving agricultural production can we ensure industrial development. Furthermore, to develop industry, we need machines, and currently some machines must be imported from abroad because we cannot produce them domestically. These machines are currently, and cannot be, exchanged with industrial products, but are exchanged with agricultural products. In order to purchase machines from abroad, we must encourage the export of all agricultural products that can be exported. Looking at the sales market of industrial products, only when agriculture is developed and the purchasing power of the vast number of farmers is truly increased, will there be a broad market for industrial products. The reason why land reform is directly for the development of agriculture and indirectly for the development of industry is also because of this. Therefore, if industry is developed, but agriculture cannot follow, the problem still cannot be solved. Similarly, if agriculture is to be truly developed, it is impossible without the development of industry; without the development of modern industry, and we cannot change from the current agricultural country into an industrial country, then agricultural production cannot be mechanized, and the construction of an independent, free, and prosperous New Democratic economy is out of the question.
    From the above analysis of the urban-rural relationship and the relationship between industry and agriculture under our New Democratic regime, we can see that strengthening the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas can not only promote the rapid recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production, but is also an important issue related to the close relationship between urban and rural areas and the consolidation of the alliance between workers and peasants.
    II. Problems Existing in the Current Exchange of Goods Between Urban and Rural Areas
    More than ten years of war, along with the severe damage suffered by the entire national economy, has not only destroyed the original production institutions, but also the original commodity circulation institutions and exchange relations between urban and rural areas. Therefore, how to effectively strengthen the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and widely promote the exchange of industrial and agricultural products today has become one of the important links in our development of a New Democratic economy and the reconstruction of a new urban-rural relationship. In the past year or so, with the basic victory of the People's Liberation War throughout the country, the basic completion of land reform in the old liberated areas, the reform of the national currency system, the recovery of transportation, the establishment and development of state-owned trade and cooperative trade, the initial recovery of private commerce in the countryside (especially in the old liberated areas), especially since the unified management and leadership of national financial and economic work since March this year, the stability of currency value and prices, etc., have all played a certain role in strengthening urban-rural relations and promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. All of this is an indispensable condition for implementing the policy of "mutual assistance between urban and rural areas" and strengthening the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas; we should continue to work hard in these areas in the future. However, in addition to this, how to rationally grasp the price policy of industrial and agricultural products, and appropriately determine the exchange parity between industrial and agricultural products, is also one of the basic policies for promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and rapidly restoring and developing industrial and agricultural production. In this regard, according to the trend of national price development in recent months – the price of grain has fallen more sharply, and the price of industrial products has risen steadily – there are currently some problems that need to be studied and resolved in a timely manner.
    What is the actual situation of the current exchange parity between major agricultural and industrial products in various regions? This can be explored from the following calculations of the actual exchange parity of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, grain, and cotton, in 1936 and the first half of 1937 before the War of Resistance Against Japan and in August 1950:
    From the changes in the exchange parity of yarn, cloth, grain, and cotton listed in the table above, it can be seen that the current scissors difference in the exchange of industrial and agricultural products is generally larger than before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Here, we will not study whether the exchange parity before the War of Resistance Against Japan was reasonable, but it is a fact that farmers now exchange the grain and cotton they produce for industrial products such as yarn and cloth for a smaller quantity than before the War of Resistance Against Japan; that is to say, before the War of Resistance Against Japan, a farmer only needed to pay 111 jin (Shanghai) to 212 jin (Taiyuan) of grain, or 18 jin (Shanghai) to 28 jin (Taiyuan) of cotton to buy a 12-pound white fine cloth in the above-mentioned cities, while now, to buy a 12-pound white fine cloth, they need to pay 159 jin (Shanghai) to 314 jin (Taiyuan) of grain, or 27 jin (Tianjin, Shanghai) to 34 jin (Hankou) of cotton. If this exchange parity between industrial and agricultural products is not adjusted reasonably in time, it will not only be extremely unfavorable to the vast number of farmers, but also very unfavorable to the promotion of the sales of yarn and cloth.
    Why has the scissors difference in the exchange parity between industrial and agricultural products increased compared to before the War of Resistance Against Japan? This is due to:
    (1) More than ten years of war have severely damaged the national industrial and agricultural production, with the damage to industrial production being more serious than that to agriculture. In the process of rebuilding a New Democratic economy today, the recovery and development of agricultural production is easier than that of industrial production. For example, the average annual total grain output in the country from 1931 to 1936 before the War of Resistance Against Japan was 284.5 billion jin, and the total national cotton output in 1936 was 16.5 million dan. In 1949, the total national grain output was 225.5 billion jin, and the total cotton output was 8.5 million dan. This year, the total national grain output is about 240 billion jin, reaching 84.4% of the pre-war level, and the total cotton output is about 14 million dan or more, reaching about 85% of the total output in 1936 before the war. In the old liberated areas of North China, agricultural production in many counties has reached the pre-war level, and individual counties have exceeded the pre-war level. However, the recovery of industrial production is much more difficult than that of agriculture.
    (2) In order to protect the development of our national industry and prevent competition from imported goods, for industrial products that our country can produce and can be self-sufficient, although the cost and selling price are higher than imported goods, we must also advocate the use of domestic products and prohibit the import of such imported goods. For industrial products that our country can produce but cannot be completely self-sufficient, we adopt a policy of high import taxes to increase their import costs in order to protect the development of domestic industry. This is essentially different from the traitorous and humiliating economic policy of the Kuomintang government in the past, which allowed imperialists to dump cheap goods to destroy and attack our national industry. This is also one of the reasons why the exchange parity of agricultural products is currently higher than before the War of Resistance Against Japan.
    (3) The current production cost and sales cost of many industrial products have also increased compared to before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Taking yarn and cloth as an example, before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the unified factory tax (i.e., goods tax) for each piece of 20-count yarn was 10.8 yuan in legal tender, which was about 5% of the yarn price at that time, while our current cotton yarn goods tax has to be levied at 15% of the yarn price due to the government's financial difficulties. The business tax of yarn and cloth production factories and the business tax and stamp tax in yarn and cloth transactions are generally higher than before the war. Furthermore, the current operating rate of yarn mills across the country has also decreased compared to before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the working hours of each yarn mill were generally 24 hours a day, while now it is at most 20 hours, and many yarn mills cannot operate at full capacity every week due to insufficient supply of raw cotton, and can only operate for five days and five nights a week. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the operating rate of spindles in the country accounted for more than 90% of the total equipment, while the current operating spindles in the country only account for about 82% of the total equipment. In addition, the current long-distance transportation of cotton (such as transferring cotton from Xi'an and Linqing to Shanghai) has a certain impact on the increase in the production cost of yarn and cloth. The increase in the production cost and sales cost of yarn and cloth is reflected in the exchange with agricultural products such as grain and cotton, that is, the relative expansion of the exchange difference.
    (4) The current transportation between regions and between urban and rural areas is not very smooth, the old set of commercial organizations between urban and rural areas has been destroyed, the new commercial network is still in the initial stage of construction, and the operation and management of many industrial production are not reasonable, etc., which also have a certain impact on the expansion of the current exchange ratio of industrial and agricultural products.
    The above are the main reasons why the current exchange parity of industrial and agricultural products has expanded compared to before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Is the expansion of the exchange parity of industrial and agricultural products a new problem this year? No. During the past twelve years of war, the exchange parity of industrial and agricultural products has been expanding. Why is this problem particularly prominent this year? This is because: In the old liberated areas, during the ten years of war, the annual income of the vast number of farmers, in addition to maintaining their general minimum living standards, was to concentrate manpower, material resources, and financial resources to support the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War. For the general industrial products needed for their daily lives, they would not buy what they could not buy, and would save as much as possible what they could save. Because at that time, the most concerned issue for the vast number of farmers was how to win the war, not other things. But the situation this year is different: the Liberation War has basically ended on the mainland, and land reform has been basically completed in the old liberated areas. In the newly liberated areas, rent reduction has generally been implemented. The burden on farmers across the country has begun to ease, and agricultural production across the country has been harvested, and the real purchasing power of farmers has begun to increase. Under this circumstance, the most concerned issue for the vast number of farmers is how to sell their surplus agricultural products and by-products and exchange them for some industrial products they need at reasonable prices. Therefore, how to widely organize the domestic and foreign sales of agricultural products and reasonably adjust the exchange parity of industrial and agricultural products has become one of the important tasks in our current economic work.
    III. How to Rationally Grasp the Exchange Parity of Industrial and Agricultural Products
    Based on the above description, we can see on the one hand that the current exchange parity of industrial and agricultural products has expanded compared to before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and on the other hand, we must also admit that there are many objective factors for this expansion of the exchange difference. So, should the current scissors difference in the exchange of industrial and agricultural products continue to expand? Or should it be appropriately reduced? I think it should be appropriately reduced within the possible range. Of course, in order to develop industry and maintain a certain profit for industrial production, this is completely justified and reasonable; but at the same time, we must also consider that in order to open up the broad road for the development of industry in our country, we must first expand the sales market for industrial products. Without a broad sales market, if no one buys industrial products, then the development of industry is unimaginable. Where is the sales market for industrial products under our New Democratic economic system? First of all, and most fundamentally, it should be the domestic market, and in the domestic market, the main one is the vast rural areas, and more than 380 million farmers are the main targets for the sales of industrial products. Therefore, if we cannot reasonably grasp the prices of industrial and agricultural products, so that the surplus products of the vast number of farmers can be sold, maintain a certain profit for agricultural production, and gradually reduce the scissors difference in the exchange of industrial and agricultural products, it will not only affect the rapid recovery and development of agricultural production, but also the recovery and development of industrial production will be directly hindered due to insufficient supply of raw materials and grain, and sluggish sales of finished products.
    How to rationally grasp the exchange parity of industrial and agricultural products? This is indeed a difficult question to answer specifically at present. Because to solve the reasonable problem of the exchange parity of industrial and agricultural products, at least the following two aspects must be scientifically calculated and grasped: (1) the calculation of the actual production cost of various industrial products (including factors that may reduce costs such as reducing waste, improving efficiency, and reasonable management), and the calculation of the actual production cost of various agricultural products (primarily major products), (2) the determination of the profit standards of various industries and agriculture. Only when the cost of industrial and agricultural products has been accurately calculated, and the production profit of industries and agriculture has a certain standard, can we talk about the reasonable calculation of the exchange parity of industrial and agricultural products. However, the current actual situation of industrial and agricultural production in our country makes it difficult for us to obtain a relatively complete concept of the above two points. Although the industrial aspect is still in the recovery period (key recovery), the existing productivity has not yet been fully utilized, and various factories have not yet universally established a scientific economic accounting system, etc., the production cost of various products and the profit and loss in sales can generally still be calculated (of course, not accurately), while the situation in the agricultural aspect is completely different, because it is a decentralized, backward small production, and the production and living conditions of each household are very different, coupled with the fact that agricultural production in our country is mainly "relying on the weather," so its production cost and profit and loss situation are currently difficult to calculate. But does this mean that we cannot currently study a more reasonable exchange parity of industrial and agricultural products? Does this mean that we currently do not have standards and bases for reasonably adjusting and grasping the exchange parity of industrial and agricultural products? No. I think the following principles should be followed in grasping and adjusting the exchange parity of industrial and agricultural products at present:
    (1) Take care of the interests of industrial and agricultural producers. In the industrial aspect, the ex-factory price of various products should be maintained so that the producers operating the products can obtain a certain profit. It may not be easy for some industrial products to obtain a certain profit at present, but we should also try our best to prevent them from losing money (such as those who lose money due to their own improper operation and poor management, which is another matter), in order to ensure the expanded reproduction of the industry or maintain the power of reproduction. Those whose profits have exceeded the normal profit rate can be appropriately adjusted from the price. In the agricultural aspect, the calculation of production cost and profit and loss, as mentioned above, is still difficult to calculate scientifically at present, but I think that taking into account the general living standards of farmers and the maintenance of reproduction should be the minimum principle in grasping the price of agricultural products, and this can be generally calculated at present.
    (2) Take care of the interests of the vast number of consumers. The selling price of various industrial and agricultural products should be based on the principle that the vast number of consumers can accept them. Otherwise, if the price is set too high and deviates from the general purchasing power level in society, it will be unaffordable for the vast number of consumers, and the result will still be that the product cannot be sold even if it is of good quality and is very much needed by society. This is not only unfavorable to the vast number of consumers, but also inevitably leads to sluggish sales of products and inflexible capital turnover for industrial and agricultural producers themselves, resulting in production stagnation.
    (3) Take care of the interests of those who organize commodity circulation. This is particularly important in the current situation where the circulation process of various industrial and agricultural products in the country is not very smooth. The prices of various industrial and agricultural products must take into account a certain price difference between producing areas and selling areas, wholesale and retail, and season to season, so that commercial operators can profit from it. Otherwise, if commercial operators cannot profit or even lose money in organizing the circulation of various commodities, then of course no one will be willing to engage in this work. Not only will private businesses not do business at a loss, but state-owned businesses and cooperative businesses are also not allowed to do business at a loss on a regular basis. On the other hand, if commercial profits are set too high, then it should of course also be opposed.
    (4) In addition to taking care of the interests of the above-mentioned producers, transporters, and sellers, our price policy should also be closely integrated with the government's production policy within a certain period. For various production undertakings that the government encourages to develop, more care should be taken of the interests of producers, such as reducing tax rates or even exempting them from taxes, reducing transportation costs, issuing loans, processing orders, purchasing finished products, and ensuring a certain profit ratio. For certain production undertakings that the government restricts the development of and that are not closely related to the interests of the national economy and the people's livelihood, the above-mentioned care and price control should be different. For those who should be encouraged to develop, if their products are indeed losing money when calculated at market prices, then it is reasonable for the government to give them a certain subsidy, which is in line with the interests of the broad masses of the people. Otherwise, it should not be assisted in order to make the distinction between encouragement and restriction clear.
    I think that the above four points should be taken into consideration in grasping the prices of various major industrial and agricultural products. But if we compare and study this principle with the above-mentioned actual exchange parity of yarn, cloth, grain, and cotton, and the changes in the objective conditions before and at present in the production and sales costs of yarn and cloth, then we will feel that: (1) It is still impossible today to completely restore the current exchange parity of industrial and agricultural products to the standard of 1936 before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and we should not demand this today. Because the various subjective and objective conditions today are not completely the same as before the war, we must explain this clearly to the vast number of farmers. (2) Starting from the actual situation, and measuring it with the above-mentioned four principles, the current price control of yarn, cloth, grain, and cotton, and their exchange parity should be appropriately adjusted. Taking Tianjin as an example, in 1936, only 153 jin of Yuhe millet were needed to buy a 12-pound white fine cloth, while now 264 jin of Yuhe millet are needed, an increase of 111 jin compared to before the war. If we add the factors of increased taxes and reduced operating rates (the calculation of all these different conditions averages about 50 jin of millet more for each cloth compared to before the war), it is also about 60 jin of millet more compared to before the war. Tianjin is the main producing area of yarn and cloth in North China, and the exchange ratio of cloth and grain in that area has expanded so much, then the exchange ratio in the rural market is of course even greater.
    How to reasonably adjust the current exchange parity of yarn, cloth, grain, and cotton? I think:
    First of all, and mainly, the current price of grain should be stabilized. In many areas, the market price is lower than the listed price, and the market price should be raised to approximately equal to the listed price to prevent low grain prices from hurting farmers. The reason why farmers in various regions are currently reflecting on the unreasonable exchange parity of industrial and agricultural products is mainly due to the fact that the price of grain has fallen too much in recent months. For example, comparing the end of August with the end of February, the average grain price in the six major cities across the country has fallen by 44%, while the average cloth price has fallen by 24%, and the yarn price has fallen by 15%. In order to stabilize grain prices and prevent them from continuing to fall due to the large-scale marketing of autumn grain at present, our state-owned trading companies must actively organize the procurement work according to the plan and at the specified grain list price standard, and quickly change the phenomenon that the current market price of autumn grain in various regions is lower than the listed price.
    Secondly, stabilize the prices of yarn and cloth, and make appropriate adjustments under the principle of ensuring a certain profit for yarn and cloth producers and distributors, especially appropriately adjusting the price of cloth (before the War of Resistance Against Japan, one piece of 20-count yarn could be exchanged for 28 or 9 pieces of 12-pound white fine cloth, but now it can only be exchanged for 24 or 5 pieces. If we analyze it from the price index before and at present, the multiple of cloth涨 is also the highest), which should be possible. According to personal calculations, it currently costs about 600 jin of cotton to produce each piece of 20-count yarn including taxes in Tianjin and Shanghai, and about 21 or 2 jin of cotton to produce each piece of 12-pound white fine cloth, while calculating according to the trading company list prices of yarn, cloth, and grain on September 27, each piece of 20-count yarn in Shanghai can be exchanged for 668 jin of cotton, and each piece of 12-pound white cloth can be exchanged for 27 jin of cotton. In Tianjin, each piece of 20-count yarn can be exchanged for 759 jin of cotton, and each piece of 12-pound white cloth can be exchanged for 29 jin of cotton. Therefore, yarn and cloth production already have a certain profit.
    Of course, the basic key to gradually reducing the scissors difference in the exchange of industrial and agricultural products still lies in: fully utilizing the productivity of various industries, increasing the production of industrial products, and achieving the goal of reducing the production cost of industrial products and reducing the exchange difference between industrial and agricultural products by improving the output of industrial products and the rationalization of industrial operation and management. But at present, appropriately raising the price of grain (so as to reach the list price) and stabilizing and appropriately adjusting the price of yarn and cloth should become one of the main links in our adjustment of the exchange difference between industrial and agricultural products. This can not only further promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and is conducive to protecting the production interests and consumption interests of the vast number of farmers, but is also beneficial to industrial producers. As the purchasing power of the vast number of farmers increases, the sales volume of various industrial products will also greatly increase.
    IV. Conclusion
    To sum up the above discussion, we can draw the following conclusions:
    At present, our urban-rural relationship has not been completely adjusted, so the exchange parity of industrial and agricultural products cannot be and should not attempt to immediately eliminate its scissors difference, but closely linking urban and rural relations, taking into account the production interests of industries and agriculture, and gradually reducing the scissors difference in the exchange of industrial and agricultural products is an important policy in the process of our New Democratic economic development. This is also as Comrade Stalin said in his "Talk with the Delegation of Foreign Workers" on November 5, 1927:
    "If the 'scissors' mentioned here refers to the difference in prices between agricultural products and industrial products (referring to cost fees), then the 'scissors' situation is like the following:
    Undoubtedly, the prices of our industrial products are now more expensive than under other conditions. The reason is that our industry is still very young, and we must defend against foreign competition and create conditions for accelerating industrial development, and the rapid development of industry is necessary for both cities and villages. Because if industry does not develop rapidly, we will not have sufficient manufactured goods and agricultural machinery to supply the rural economy on time. This situation creates a price difference between industrial products and agricultural products, which causes a little loss to the rural economy.
    In order to eliminate this loss to the rural economy, the government and the party have adopted a policy of gradually and continuously reducing the prices of industrial products. Can this policy be called practical? I think this policy is absolutely practical. Everyone knows that in the most recent year, the retail prices of industrial products have been reduced by 80%. At the same time, our industrial organizations have systematically reduced the cost fees and wholesale prices of industrial products. We can undoubtedly believe that this policy will continue to be adopted in the future. In addition, I would also like to tell you that the policy of continuously reducing the prices of industrial products is the hub of our entire economic policy. Without this policy, there is no way to talk about the improvement and rationalization of our industry, and there is also no way to consolidate the alliance between workers and peasants."
    This continuous reduction of the prices of industrial products and the reduction of the scissors difference in the exchange of industrial products and agricultural products is also one of the important signs that distinguishes our New Democratic economic system from the capitalist economic system.
    Finally, I must also declare that how to reasonably grasp the exchange parity of industrial and agricultural products is not only a theoretical issue, but also a concrete practical issue. I hope to arouse the attention of economic scholars and financial and economic colleagues to study this issue.

　　论城乡物资交流与工农业品的交换比价
    杨波
    一、城乡物资交流的重要性
    “城乡互助”是我新民主主义经济建设的根本方针之一，“城乡互助”政策的具体实现，即是如何促进城乡物资交流，通过城乡之间工业品与农产品的畅通流转，以达工农业生产的迅速恢复与发展的目的。
    在资本主义的国家里，资本主义的生产是城市支配乡村，城市剥削乡村。资本主义发展的规律，亦即是：大资本支配小资本，大资本剥削小资本。城市工商业资本家，依其雄厚的资本来掌握市场，操纵物价；乡村的广大农民，由于分散、贫困，因此农产品的价格亦即常被城市工商业资本家所操纵，他们通过不等价的交换来剥削广大农民。在资本主义制度下，城乡之间就是存在着这种支配和剥削的关系；一般都是工业发展比较快，农业发展则比较慢。资本家不但要剥削工人，而且还要剥削广大农民。同样的因为农业生产相对的落后，粮食和原料的供给不能满足工业发展的需要，于是就要向外掠夺，寻求原料和粮食的供应地；另一方面也由于农业生产相对的落后，农民购买力低，工业产品销不出去，又要到国外去找销售市场。因之，在资本主义国家里从城市支配和剥削乡村，而发展到工业国支配和剥削农业国，也就是帝国主义国家支配和剥削殖民地、半殖民地的国家。旧中国的城乡交换关系，则是被帝国主义、官僚资产阶级、封建地主与投机商人操纵的，他们都在工农业产品的交换中，残酷地剥削着广大农民及千百万的手工业生产者。
    而在今天我们，新民主主义政权下的城乡关系，则是完全不同的，既不是建立资本主义式的城乡关系，也不是维持旧中国式的城乡关系，而是重建新的“城乡兼顾”，“城乡互助”的关系，必须使城市和乡村，工人和农民，工业和农业密切的联结起来。是城市领导乡村，但决不可以丢掉乡村，而光顾城市。一方面要发展工业，另方面又要发展农业。在过去我们还没有占领城市时，首要的工作是发展农业；而现在全国大陆上各大、中、小城市均已为我解放，即要注重恢复与发展工业，但发展工业并不等于放松发展农业，同样的，农业仍要继续发展。因为发展工业要有充分的原料和粮食供应，这就非发展农业不可。现在我们全国的粮食，还不是很富余的，每遇严重的灾荒，即感粮食供应不足，棉花、麻等主要工业原料的生产，则更感不足。粮食要增产，棉麻等也要增产，因此只有提高农业生产。农业生产发展了，工业的发展才更有保障。再如发展工业要有机器，而目前有些机器因我们国内不能生产而必须靠国外输入，这些机器的输入，我们目前不是用亦不可能是用工业品换回来，而是用农产品去换回来。为向国外购买机器，凡能出口的农产品我们都要奖励出口。如再从工业品的销售市场上来看，也只有农业发展了，广大农民的购买力真正提高了，工业品的销售才有广阔的市场。土地改革之所以是：直接是为发展农业，间接也是为发展工业，其道理亦即在于此。所以，如果工业发展了，而农业不能跟着发展，问题仍然是不能解决。同样的要使农业真正得到发展，没有工业的发展也是不可能的；没有近代化工业的发展，不能由现在的农业国变成工业国，则农业生产便不能机械化，独立、自由、繁荣的新民主主义经济的建设，也是无从谈起的。
    从上述我们新民主主义政权下的城乡关系，工业与农业的关系分析中，便可知道：加强城乡物资交流，不但可以促进工业与农业生产的迅速恢复与发展，而且也是一个有关密切城乡关系，巩固工人与农民联盟的重要问题。
    二、目前城乡物资交流中存在的问题
    十余年来的战争，随着整个国民经济所遭到的严重摧残，不但已把原有的生产机构破坏了，同时亦把原有的城乡商品流通机构和交换关系破坏了。因之，今天如何有效地加强城乡物资交换，广泛地促进工农业产品的交流，即成为我们发展新民主主义经济，重建新的城乡关系中的重要环节之一。过去一年多的时间中，随着人民解放战争在全国范围内取得了基本胜利，土地改革在老解放区内的基本完成，全国币制的改革，交通事业的恢复，国营贸易与合作社贸易的建立与发展，私营商业在乡村中的初步恢复（特别是老解放区），特别是自今年三月以来全国财政经济工作的统一管理与领导，币值与物价的稳定等等，对密切城乡关系，促进城乡物资交流上，皆发挥了其一定的作用。这一切皆是贯彻“城乡互助”政策，加强城乡物资交流工作中不可缺少的条件；今后我们仍应继续在这些方面努力。但，除此以外，如何合理的掌握工业品与农产品的价格政策，适当的确定工农业产品之间的交换比价，则亦是促进城乡物资交流，迅速恢复与发展工农业生产的基本政策之一，而在这一方面，根据近几月来全国物价发展的趋势——粮价下跌幅度较大，工业品稳升——目前是存在着一些问题，需要我们及时的予以研究解决。
    目前各地主要农产品与工业品的交换比价，其实际情况是怎样的呢？这可从以下工业品的棉纱、棉布，与农产品的粮食、棉花在抗战前的一九三六年、一九三七年上半年与一九五○年八月份的实际交换比价计算中，加以探讨，且看下表：
    从上表所列纱、布与粮、棉的交换比价战前与今年八月份的变化中，可以看出：目前工业品与农产品交换中的剪刀差额，一般皆较抗战前扩大。这里对于抗战前的交换比价是否合理的问题，姑且不去研究，但现在农民拿自己生产的粮食，棉花与纱、布等工业品交换，较之抗战以前在数量上换的少了确是事实；也即是说抗战前一个农民在上述城市买一匹十二磅白细布只须付出粮食一一一斤（上海）到二一二斤（太原），或付出棉花十八斤（上海）到二十八斤（太原），而现在买一匹十二磅白细布，则须付出粮食一五九斤（上海）到三一四斤（太原），或付出棉花二十七斤（津、沪）到三十四斤（汉口）。此种工业品与农产品的交换比价，如不及时加以合理的调整，则不但对广大农民是极其不利的，而且对推广纱、布的销售上，也是很不利的。
    为什么目前工业品与农产品的交换比价的剪刀差，较之抗战前扩大了呢？这是由于：
    （一）十余年来的战争，使全国的工农业生产事业均受到了严重的破坏，其中工业生产所遭到的破坏又较农业为重。而在今天我们重建新民主主义经济的过程中，农业生产的恢复与发展较之工业生产的恢复与发展则又较为容易。如抗战前一九三一至一九三六年平均每年全国粮食总产量为二八四五亿斤，一九三六年全国棉花总产量为一六五○万市担，一九四九年全国粮食总产量为二二五五亿斤，棉花总产量为八五○万市担，今年全国粮食总产量约为二四○○亿斤，已达战前的百分之八四·四，棉花总产量约为一四○○万市担以上，已达战前一九三六年总产量的百分之八五左右。在华北老解放区的农业生产，许多县份已达战前水平，个别县则超过了战前水平。而工业生产的恢复，则远较农业困难为多。
    （二）为了保护我们本国民族工业的发展，防止舶来品的竞争，凡本国可以出产并能自给的工业品，虽然较舶来品成本高，售价贵，但我们亦必须提倡使用本国产品，禁止该项舶来品的进口，凡本国可以出产但尚不能完全自给的工业品，我们则采取高税进口的政策，提高其进口成本，以保护本国工业的发展，这与过去国民党政府的丧权辱国，让帝国主义倾销廉价商品来摧残打击我国民族工业的反动经济政策，是有本质的区别的。这也是目前农业产品的交换比价较之抗战前扩大的原因之一。
    （三）有许多工业品目前的生产成本与出售成本，亦较抗战前增加了。以纱布为例，抗战前每件二十支纱的出厂统税（即货物税）为法币十元零八角，约合当时纱价的百分之五，而现在我们的棉纱货物税，则由于政府的财政困难，而不得不按纱价的百分之十五征收。纱布生产工厂的营业税及纱布交易中的营业税，印花税等，一般的亦皆较战前增加了。再如目前全国纱厂的操业率较之抗战前亦降低了，抗战前各纱厂每天的开工时间一般皆是二十四小时，而现在最多为二十小时，且有许多纱厂因原棉供应不足，每星期不能开全工，而只能开工五天五夜。抗战前全国纱锭之运转率占总设备数的百分之九十以上，而目前全国运转的纱锭，只占设备总数的百分之八十二左右。此外目前长距离的棉花调运（如调西安、临清的棉花供应上海之用），对纱布生产成本的增高，亦有一定的影响。纱布生产成本与出售成本的增高，其表现在与粮棉等农产品的交换上，亦即为交换差额的相对扩大。
    （四）目前地区与地区之间，城乡之间的交通尚不十分畅通，城乡之间旧的一套商业组织已被破坏，新的商业网尚在初建，许多工业生产的经营管理尚不合理等，对目前工农业产品交换比例的扩大，亦有一定的影响。
    以上即是目前工农业品交换比价之所以较之抗战前扩大的主要原因。工农业品交换比价的扩大，是否是今年新出现的问题呢？不是的。过去十二年的战争当中，工农业品的交换比价是一直在扩大着。为什么今年这一问题表现得特别突出呢？这是由于：在老解放区，十多年的战争当中，广大农民每年的收入，除维持其一般的最低限度的生活外，则是集中人力、物力、财力支援抗日战争及人民解放战争，对于自己日常生活所需的一般工业品，则是凡可不买的即不买，凡可节俭的即尽量节俭。因为当时广大农民最关心的问题是如何取得战争的胜利，而不是其它。但今年的情况即不同：解放战争已在全国大陆上基本结束，土地改革已在老解放区基本完成。在新解放区，一般已实行了减租。全国农民的负担已开始减轻，全国的农业生产已告丰收，农民的真实购买力已开始提高。在这种情况下，广大农民所最最关心的问题，即是如何使自己所剩余的农产品及其副产品卖得出去，并能以合理的价格换回自己所需的一些工业品。因之，如何广泛地组织农产品的内销和外销，合理的调整工农业品的交换比价，亦即成为我们当前经济工作中的重要任务之一。
    三、如何合理的掌握工农业品的交换比价
    根据以上叙述，我们一方面可以看出目前工农业品的交换比价较之抗战前是扩大了，另方面我们亦必须承认这种交换差额的扩大，是有许多客观因素的。那么，目前工业品与农产品交换的剪刀差额，究竟是应该继续扩大呢？还是应该适当地缩小呢？我认为是应该在可能的范围内，适当的予以缩小。当然，为了发展工业，保持工业生产的一定的利润，这是完全应该的，合理的；但同时我们亦必须考虑到，为了开阔我国工业发展的康庄大道，我们目前首先即必须扩大工业品的销售市场，没有广阔的销售市场，工业品没有人来买，则工业的发展即是不可想像的。我们新民主主义经济制度下工业品的销售市场在那里呢？首先而且是最基本的，应该是国内的市场，而在国内市场来讲，目前则主要的又是广大的农村，三万万八千万以上的农民即是工业品销售的主要对象。因此我们如果不能合理的掌握工农业产品的价格，使广大农民的剩余产品得以出售，保持农业生产的一定的利润，逐渐缩小工农业品交换的剪刀差额，则不但影响着农业生产的迅速恢复与发展，而且工业生产的恢复与发展，亦将因原料、粮食供应不足，成品销售不畅，而直接受到阻碍。
    如何合理的掌握工业品与农产品的交换比价呢？这在目前来讲确是一个难于具体回答的问题。因为要解决工业品与农产品交换比价的合理问题，起码必须对下列两方面的情况加以科学的计算与掌握：（一）各种工业品实际生产成本的计算（包括减少浪费，提高效率，合理经营等可能减低成本的因素在内），及各种农产品（首先是主要的产品）实际生产成本的计算，（二）各种工业及农业的利润标准的确定，只有工农业产品的成本有了精确的计算，工农业的生产利润有了一定的标准，才可以谈到合理的计算工农业产品的交换比价。但目前我国工农业生产的实际情况，却使我们很难对上述两点得出一个比较完整的概念。在工业方面虽然还是处于：恢复时期（重点恢复），现有的生产力还未能得到充分的发挥和利用，各工厂还未有普遍的建立起科学的经济核算制度等情况，但各种产品的生产成本及销售中的盈亏状况，大体上总还是可以计算出来的（当然不是精确的），而在农业方面的情况则完全不同，由于它是分散的、落后的小生产，各家各户的生产与生活条件皆差别很大，加上目前我国农业生产主要还是“靠天吃饭”，因之其生产成本及盈亏状况，目前也就很难计算。但这样是否即可以说目前我们即无法研究比较合理的工农业品的交换比价呢？是否我们目前即没有合理调整、掌握工农业产品交换比价的标准与根据呢？不是的。我想目前我们在掌握调整工农业产品的交换比价中，下列的原则是应当遵守的：
    （一）照顾工农业生产者的利益。在工业方面，各种产品的出厂价格，应保持使经营该项产品的生产者，得到一定的利润，有些工业的产品目前可能还不易获得一定的利润，但我们亦应尽量使其不致赔本（如因其本身经营不当，管理不善而致赔本者，则又是另外一回事），以保证该项工业的扩大再生产或保持再生产的力量。其盈利已超过正常的利润率者，则可从价格中予以适当的调整。在农业方面，其生产成本费与盈亏的计算，正如上面所说目前还很难科学计算出来，但我想在掌握农产品价格时，照顾到农民一般的生活水平及再生产的维持，应是起码的原则，而在这一点上，大体上目前还是可以计算的。
    （二）照顾广大消费者的利益。各种工业品及农产品的销售价格，皆应照顾到使广大消费者能够接受为原则，否则，如果价格定得过高，脱离了社会上一般的购买力水平，为广大的消费者所买不起，则该项产品即使是质量很好，社会上很需要，其结果依然是卖不出去。这不但对广大的消费者不利，而且对工农业生产者本身来讲，亦必然造成产品滞销，资金周转不灵，以致生产停顿的结果。
    （三）照顾组织商品流通者的利益。这在目前全国各种工农业产品的流转过程尚不十分畅通的情况下，尤为重要。各种工农业产品价格之掌握，必须照顾到产地与销地，批发与零售，季节与季节之间的一定的差价，使商业运销者有利可图。否则如果商业运销者在组织各种商品的流通过程中，无利可图甚或赔本，则当然无人愿意从事此项工作。不但私营商业不做赔本生意，即是国营商业与合作社商业，也是不允许经常做赔本的买卖的。反之，如果商业利润定得太高，则当然也应反对。
    （四）除照顾以上产、运、销三者的利益外，我们的价格政策亦应与一定时期内政府的生产方针相密切结合。凡属政府奖励发展的各种生产事业，则对生产者的利益即应多加照顾，如降低税率甚至免税，减低运费、发放贷款、加工定货、收购成品，保证其一定的利润比例等。凡属政府限制发展及与国计民生的利益关系不大的某些生产事业，则在上述各方面的照顾及价格掌握上，即应有所不同。对应奖励发展者，其产品如按市价计算确实赔本者，则政府给予其一定的贴补亦属合理，是符合广大人民利益的。否则即不应扶助，以明奖励与限制之别。
    以上四点，我想我们在掌握各种主要工农业产品的价格时，是应当统筹兼顾的。但如依此项原则再与上述目前纱、布与粮、棉的实际交换比价及纱、布生产与出售成本，战前与目前客观条件的变化等来比较研究，则我们即会感到：（１）要使目前工业品与农产品的交换比价，完全恢复到抗战前一九三六年的标准，今天还是不可能的，今天我们亦不应该这样要求。因为今天与战前的各种主客观条件并不完全一样，此点我们必须向广大农民讲清楚。（２）从现实情况出发，以上述四项原则来衡量，目前纱、布、粮、棉价格的掌握，其交换比价似应加以适当的调整。以天津为例，一九三六年买一匹十二磅白细布只须付出御河小米一五三斤，而现在则须付出御河小米二六四斤，较战前增加了一一一斤，如果再把目前税收增加了，操业率降低了等因素加进去（这一切不同条件计算起来，平均每一匹布约须较战前增加五十斤小米左右），则亦较战前增加了六十斤小米左右。天津是华北纱、布的主要产地，该地布、粮的交换比例皆扩大了这许多，则农村市场的交换比例，当然也就更大了。
    如何合理的调整目前的纱、布与粮、棉的交换比价呢？我认为：
    首先而且是主要的应将目前粮食的价格稳定住。许多地区市价低于牌价，应把市价提到与牌价约略相等，以防谷贱伤农。目前各地农民反映工农业品交换比价的不合理，主要是由于近几月来粮食价格下跌幅度太大所引起，如八月底与二月底比较，全国六大城市粮价平均下跌了百分之四十四，而布价则平均下跌了百分之二十四，纱价下跌了百分之十五。为要稳住粮价，使其不致因目前秋粮大量上市而继续下跌，我国营贸易公司必须在规定的粮食牌价标准上，按计划地积极地组织收购工作，迅速改变目前各地秋粮市价低于牌价的现象。
    其次，稳住纱布价格，并在保证纱布生产者及运销者的一定利润的原则下，予以适当的调整，特别是适当调整布的价格（抗战前一件二十支纱可以换到十二磅白细布二十八、九匹，现在只能换到二十四、五匹。如从抗战前与目前的物价指数分析，也是以布涨的倍数最多），应该是可能的。根据个人的计算，目前在津、沪两地，每生产一件二十支纱包括税款在内约须棉花六○○斤左右，每生产一匹十二磅白细布，约须棉花二十一、二斤，而以九月二十七日纱、布与粮食的贸易公司牌价计算，上海每件二十支纱可换到棉花六六八斤，每匹十二磅白布可换到棉花二十七斤，天津每件二十支纱可换到棉花七五九斤，每匹十二磅白布可换到棉花二十九斤。因此，纱布生产已经有了一定的利润了。
    当然，要逐渐缩小工业品与农产品交换中的剪刀差额，其基本关键还在于：充分发挥各种工业的生产力，增加工业品的生产量，从提高工业品的产量，和工业经营管理的合理化中，以达减低工业品的生产成本，缩小工农业品交换差额的目的。但在目前来讲，适当地提高粮价（以达牌价为准），稳住并适当调整纱布的价格，则应当成为我们调整工业品与农产品交换差额中的主要环节之一。这不但可以进一步促进城乡物资交流，有利于保护广大农民的生产利益与消费利益，而且对工业生产者来讲也是有利的。广大农民的购买力增加了，各种工业品的销售量当亦将随之大大增加。
    四、结语
    总括以上论述，我们可以得出如下的结论：
    目前我们的城乡关系，尚未完全调整，因此工农业产品的交换比价，目前不可能亦不应企图立即消灭其剪刀差额，但密切城乡关系，兼顾工农业的生产利益，逐渐缩小工农业产品交换的剪刀差额，则却是我们新民主主义经济发展过程中的重要政策。这也正如斯大林同志一九二七年十一月五日“与外国工人代表团的谈话”中所说的一样：
    “如果，这里所说的‘剪刀’是指农产品和工业品（指成本费）间价格的差异而言，那末，‘剪刀’形势就像下面所说的那样：
    毫无疑义的，现在我们工业品的价格，比在其他条件下要贵些。其原因，就是因为我们的工业还很幼稚，我们还必须防御外来的竞争，造成加速工业发展的条件，而工业的迅速发展，对于城市和乡村同样都是必要的。因为工业如果不加速发展，我们就没有充分的制造品与农业机器可以按时的供给农村经济。这一种情形，就造成了工业品与农产品的价格差异，这种差异，对于农村经济是有一点损失的。
    为了消除农村经济的这一种损失起见，政府和党采取了逐渐地不断地降低工业品价格的政策。这个政策是否能称为实际的呢？我认为这个政策绝对是实际的。大家知道，在最近一年来，工业品的零卖价格已降低了百分之八十。同时，我们的工业组织已经有系统地减低工业品的成本费与批发价格。我们毫无疑义地可以坚信这个政策将来还是要继续采取的。此外我还要告诉你们，不断降低工业品价格的政策，是我们整个经济政策的枢纽，没有这个政策，就根本谈不到我们工业的改善、合理化，同时也根本莫想巩固工农的联合。”
    这种不断的减低工业品的价格，缩小工业品与农产品交换的剪刀差额，亦正是我们新民主主义经济制度区别于资本主义经济制度的重要标志之一。
    最后我还必须声明一句，如何合理的掌握工农业品的交换比价，既是一个理论问题，也是一个具体的实际问题。希望能引起各位经济学者与财经工作同志对此问题加以研究。
