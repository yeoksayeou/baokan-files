    Yan Jinfen
    I am very happy to attend this meeting. I didn't participate in the founding ceremony last year, but this year I not only participated in the National Day celebration, but also attended the capital's conference. In the future, I will put forth practical efforts, convey the spirit of the conference to the workers, and find ways to complete the tasks.

    Rong Guanxiu
    I am very happy to participate in this meeting today. This happiness is given to us by Chairman Mao. I will never forget this kindness. Although the harvest is not good in my hometown this year, I will definitely go back and find ways to lead everyone in labor, overcome difficulties, and never let the higher authorities worry about us, and never let the soldiers at the front lines worry about us. American devils, don't be arrogant. I will definitely go back and produce well to support the front lines and defeat your aggressive provocations.

    Guo Aini
    I feel very honored to participate in this meeting, and this honor is given to us by Chairman Mao. In the future, I will definitely go back and motivate women to improve production, produce more grain, support the front lines, and liberate Taiwan.

    Lu Cuiying
    I am very happy to participate in this meeting, especially after seeing Chairman Mao, I feel even happier. This is what the Communist Party has helped us achieve. After I go back, I will definitely improve my village and be determined to carry the revolution through to the end. We are very grateful for the care that the leaders have shown us in this meeting. I wish Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu good health forever.

    Li Luoqin
    Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, there are many peace-loving people. We are constantly expanding our strength and strengthening the struggle against the warmongers. Today, the working people of peace-loving people's democratic countries are engaged in construction. The fighting heroes who defend peace must strengthen their initiative and fight against the aggression of American imperialism. We resolutely support the struggle of the Korean people and drive the American soldiers out of Korea.

    Ren Zhan'ao
    With our People's Republic, the people have freedom. The People's Republic is our people's country, and we must warmly celebrate its birthday. We must quickly eliminate the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. If anyone dares to stop us from liberating Taiwan, we will defeat them.

    Wang Yunqiao
    In the future, I will go back to work harder and lead the people to produce, improve production, and complete the tasks well.

    我这回参加这个会，心里很高兴。去年开国典礼，我没有参加，今年我不但参加了国庆，而且是参加首都的大会。今后我要拿出实际力量，把大会的精神对工人讲，并设法完成任务。

    在毛主席领导下，爱好和平的人们很多啦，我们不断地扩大着自己的力量，加强对战争贩子的斗争。今天爱好和平的人民民主国家的劳动人民，正在从事建设。保卫和平的战斗英雄，要加强积极性，为反对美帝的侵略而斗争。我们坚决支援朝鲜人民的斗争，把美国兵从朝鲜赶出去。
