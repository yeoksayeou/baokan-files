　　Xinhua News Agency, October 25th—A large number of Canadian soldiers dispatched to Korea to assist the United States in its war of aggression have deserted, unwilling to fight for the American aggressors. According to a United Press International report from Ottawa: More than seven hundred soldiers in the Canadian special brigade sent to Korea have "left their posts without leave." This incident has greatly alarmed the Canadian military authorities. The Department of the Army immediately conducted a large-scale "search" on the 20th, and Defense Minister Claxton immediately ordered an investigation of other brigades stationed in six Canadian training camps.
