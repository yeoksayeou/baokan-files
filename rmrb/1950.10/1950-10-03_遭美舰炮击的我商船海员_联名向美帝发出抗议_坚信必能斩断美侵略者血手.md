Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st. All crew members of the Chinese merchant ship "Anhai No. 21" of the Andong Port Authority of the Northeast People's Government Navigation Administration Bureau, which was attacked by a US warship on September 21st at sea 50 nautical miles from Chengshantou, Shandong Peninsula, jointly issued a letter of protest. It stated: We are the crew of the "Anhai No. 21" merchant ship of the Andong Port Authority of the Northeast People's Government Navigation Administration Bureau. Our task is to travel between the commercial ports of Andong, Shidao, and Qingdao, transporting goods needed for the people's livelihood and production. We brave the wind and waves every day, diligently completing our transportation tasks. We are working hard to build the People's Republic of China quickly and create a happy future for ourselves and our children. However, US imperialism is attempting to undermine our peaceful construction and happy life. When our merchant ship was intercepted and shelled by a US warship, and all staff and passengers were subjected to unreasonable searches, we were extremely indignant and could not tolerate it. We believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people can not only defeat Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of US imperialism, but will also be able to sever the bloody hands of US imperialism's own aggression. We will resolutely stand with the people of the whole country, work harder to produce, fully accumulate strength, and be ready to eliminate any aggressors who dare to take risks.

Note: After arriving in Andong on September 23rd, the ship sailed to Yantai City, Shandong Province on the 27th to continue its transportation tasks.

　　遭美舰炮击的我商船海员
    联名向美帝发出抗议
    坚信必能斩断美侵略者血手
    【新华社沈阳一日电】九月二十一日在距山东半岛成山头五十海里之海面上遭美舰炮击之我国商船“安海二十一号”全体船员联名发表抗议书。内称：我们是东北人民政府航政总局安东港湾管理局“安海二十一号”商船的船员。我们的任务是往来航行安东、石岛、青岛等商埠，运输人民的生活与生产需用物资。我们终日乘风破浪，紧张地完成运输任务。我们是为了迅速地把中华人民共和国建设好，为我们自己和我们的儿女创造美满的将来。但美帝国主义却企图破坏我们和平建设和幸福的生活。当我们的商船被美国军舰拦截炮击，全体职员和旅客被蛮横无理盘查时，我们万分愤恨，不能容忍。我们相信：中国人民在毛主席领导下，既能打倒美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石、也必能斩断美帝国主义自己的侵略血手。我们将坚决和全国人民一起，更加努力生产，充分积蓄力量，随时消灭任何敢于冒险的侵略者。
    按：该船于九月二十三日抵达安东后，已于二十七日开往山东省烟台市，继续进行运输任务。
