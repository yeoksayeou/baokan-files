Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang: The US imperialists' mad act of extending the war of aggression against Korea to the border of Northeast China has aroused great anger among the people of the entire Northeast region. Voices from workers, peasants, youth, and families of military personnel from all over the region have unanimously expressed their heroic determination to resist aggression. Nie Zhongyi, a model worker from the Andong Paper Mill attending the National Congress of Model Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, said, "We workers in Andong, who stand on the front line of national defense, have raised a high degree of vigilance against the conspiracies of the American aggressor troops. We are now redoubling our production to consolidate national defense. We tell the American devils: If you dare to come to our border to start a fire, that is a dead end." Xu Ting, a peasant from the Zhen'an District of the town, said, "I saw through the American devils' intentions long ago; they just don't want us to live a good life. All of us Chinese people must oppose the American devils' conspiracy to expand their aggression." Song Chuanyi, a model military dependent in the city who is sixty-eight years old, said excitedly, "During the Liberation War, I already sent my own son to join the People's Liberation Army. If the American devils come to invade today, I will definitely come out myself and do more for the country."

A student from the Physics Department of Northeast Normal University wrote to Chairman Mao saying: "On this day when US imperialism is burning the flames of its war of aggression to our border, we cannot help but recall the miserable life of slaves under the fourteen years of rule by the Japanese invaders and the suffering we endured during the Kuomintang rule. We guarantee to intensify our studies, strengthen our bodies, and prepare to be teachers of the people. If the motherland is invaded, we will learn from the spirit of the Soviet heroes Matrosov and Zoya and dedicate everything we have to defend the motherland."

All the staff and workers of the Shixian Paper Mill in Jilin Province stated: The actions of the US troops invading Korea to expand the war of aggression have aroused our high vigilance. We have decided to launch a comprehensive production competition and strive to complete this year's production tasks one month ahead of schedule to strengthen our national defense forces.

Liu Junqing, a peasant from the suburbs of Chengde City, the capital of Rehe Province, said with righteous indignation: "No matter how mad the American devils are, they will sooner or later end up like the Japanese devils."

Workers in Dalian are enthusiastically launching a patriotic production competition. Many young workers have also stated: "We are now stepping up production. If the motherland needs us, we will definitely contribute all our strength to defend the motherland's borders!"

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 27th: The newspapers here today, the 27th, all published on the front page the telegram sent by Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, to the United Nations on October 26th. The headlines of the newspapers unanimously pointed out: The United Nations must immediately take measures to extinguish the flames of war. Xinwen Ribao and Wenhui Bao also published commentaries. The Xinwen Ribao's commentary said: The US imperialists' mad acts of aggression are seriously threatening our country's security. In order to crush any provocations by US imperialism, the people of the whole country must redouble their vigilance and strengthen our national strength in all aspects. At the same time, we must more resolutely launch a struggle against US-Chiang bandits and special agents and rumor-mongers. The commentary warned US imperialism: The Chinese people will never tolerate foreign aggression. We, like the Soviet people, know how to respond to bombs with bombs. If the American aggressors think that our love of peace is a sign of weakness, they will suffer the consequences. The Wenhui Bao's editorial said: The Chinese people will definitely wield an iron fist to crush any violence that attempts to invade China's territorial sovereignty.

    沪各报拥护周外长向联合国控诉美机犯我领空
    【本报讯】据新华社沈阳讯：美帝国主义把侵朝战争扩展至我国东北边境的疯狂行为，引起了东北全区人民的巨大愤怒。来自各地的工人、农民、青年和军人家属们的呼声，都一致表现了坚决反抗侵略的英雄意志。出席全国工农兵劳动模范大会的安东造纸厂模范工人聂忠义说：“我们站在国防最前线的安东市工人，对于美国侵略军队的阴谋已提起高度的警惕。现在我们正在加倍生产，巩固国防。我们告诉美国鬼子：如果敢于跑到我国边境上来点火，那就是死路一条。”该市镇安区农民徐亭说：“我早看透美国鬼子的心眼，它就是不让我们过好日子。咱们全中国人民一定要反对美国鬼子的扩大侵略的阴谋。”该市六十八岁的模范军属宋传义激昂地说：“在解放战争中我已把亲儿子送去当解放军。今天美国鬼子要是来侵犯，我一定自己出来多为国家出力。”
    东北师范大学物理系学生上书毛主席说：“正当美帝国主义把侵略战争的火焰燃烧到我国边境的今天，我们不禁回忆起日寇统治下的十四年牛马不如的奴隶生活和国民党统治时期所遭受的迫害的苦难。我们保证加紧学习，锻炼身体，准备做一个人民的教师。假如祖国遭受侵犯，我们将学习苏联英雄马特罗索夫和卓娅的精神，为保卫祖国而献出我们的一切。
    吉林省石岘造纸厂全体职工表示：美国侵略朝鲜的军队扩大侵略战争的行动已引起我们的高度警惕。我们决定开展全面的生产竞赛，争取提前一个月完成今年的生产任务，来加强国防力量。
    热河省省会承德市郊农民刘俊卿怀着满腔愤怒说：“不管美国鬼子怎样疯狂，他早晚也要落得个日本鬼子的下场。”
    旅大市的工人们正在热烈展开爱国主义的生产竞赛。许多青年工人并表示：“现在我们正在加紧生产。如果祖国需要，我们一定拿出一切力量来保卫祖国边疆！”
    【新华社上海二十七日电】此间各报二十七日都以首版头条地位刊载中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长十月二十六日致联合国的电报。各报的标题一致指出：联合国必须立即采取措施，熄灭战争的火焰。新闻日报、文汇报并发表评论。新闻日报的评论说：美帝国主义的疯狂侵略行动正在严重地威胁着我国的安全。为了粉碎美帝国主义任何挑衅，全国人民还得加倍提高警惕，在一切方面充实我们的国力，同时更坚决地展开反对美蒋匪特和谣言散布者的斗争。评论警告美帝国主义说：中国人民决不能容忍外国的侵略。我们也像苏联人民一样懂得以炸弹回敬炸弹的。美国侵略者如果以为我们热爱和平就是软弱的表示，那就要自食其果。文汇报的社论说：对于任何企图侵略中国领土主权的任何暴力，中国人民一定挥出铁拳，予以粉碎。
