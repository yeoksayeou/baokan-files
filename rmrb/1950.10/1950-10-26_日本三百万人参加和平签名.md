The China Committee for the Defense of World Peace received a letter dated September 21st from the Japan and Great Committee, reporting on the current situation of the Japanese people's movement to defend world peace as follows:

　　The number of Japanese people who have signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal, as of September 20, 1950, totals 3,056,604. According to the statistics of the number of signatures by prefecture, Osaka Prefecture has 646,246, Tokyo Metropolis has 447,112, Kyoto Prefecture has 226,021, Kanagawa Prefecture has 136,597, Fukuoka Prefecture has 120,594, Aichi Prefecture has 106,012, and Hokkaido has 105,257.

　　The Japan and Great Committee called on the Japanese people to conduct a peace vote campaign between April and May 1950, expressing the will of the Japanese people to "oppose military bases and demand comprehensive peace negotiations." After receiving the notice from the World Peace Congress Committee on launching the Stockholm Peace Appeal signature campaign on May 22nd, the committee combined the peace signature campaign with the peace vote. Recently, in order to strengthen the peace signature campaign, October 14th and 15th have been designated as Peace Voting Days, and plans are being made to mobilize one million people to collect ten million signatures during these two days. A conference to defend peace will be held in Tokyo on November 5th, and at that time, the Standing Committee of the Great Committee in Paris will be informed by telegram of the number of peace signatures collected.

　　The Japan and Great Committee has preliminarily decided to send eight well-known individuals, fourteen central representatives of organizations, and eighteen local representatives to attend the Second World Peace Congress.

　　日本三百万人参加和平签名
    中国保卫世界和平大会委员会接日本和大委员会九月二十一日来信，报告日本人民保卫世界和平运动的现状如下：
    日本人民在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签名人数，截至一九五○年九月二十日止共计三百零五万六千六百零四人。按府县别的签名人数统计，大阪府六十四万六千二百四十六人，东京都四十四万七千一百十二人，京都府二十二万六千零二十一人，神奈川县十三万六千五百九十七人，福冈县十二万零五百九十四人，爱知县十万零六千零十二人，北海道十万零五千二百五十七人。
    日本和大委员会曾于一九五○年四月、五月间号召日本人民进行和平投票运动，表示日本人民“反对军事基地化、要求全面讲和”的意志。五月二十二日该会接到世界保卫和平大会委员会关于发动斯德哥尔摩和平宣言签名运动的通告以后，便将和平签名与和平投票结合起来。最近为了加强和平签名运动，定十月十四、十五两日为和平投票日，准备在这两日间动员一百万人征集一千万人的签名。十一月五日将在东京举行保卫和平会议，届时将以征集和平签名人数电告巴黎和大常设委员会。
    日本和大委员会初步决定派遣知名个人八人，团体中央代表十四人，地方代表十八人出席第二次世界保卫和平大会。
