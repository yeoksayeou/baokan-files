Xinhua News Agency, San Francisco, 4th: According to a report by the Dentsu News Agency, a large string of new U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force bases are currently being built on the west coast of Japan, requiring 25 billion yen. This cost will be paid by Japanese taxpayers. To this end, the Yoshida government has decided to increase taxes on the people and raise fares on Japanese National Railways by 65 percent.
	This network of bases stretches across the west coasts of the three major islands of Japan: Hokkaido, Honshu, and Kyushu. Most of these bases are located in the following areas: the Wakkanai district at the northern tip of Hokkaido Island; the Otaru district in western Hokkaido, including the entire Ishikari Bay; Funakawa Port in northwestern Honshu; the Niigata district of Honshu facing Sado Island (Sado Island has been turned into a huge war front base by the United States, and the United States is paying special attention to establishing a naval base in Ebisuminato on the east bay of the island and a large air force base near Kawaharada Port on the west bay); the Maizuru area, including the entire Wakasa Bay northwest of Kyoto; Hamada, north of Hiroshima, facing Busan Port of Korea to the west; and the Fukuoka-Sasebo area in northwestern Kyushu.
	Ports with huge military facilities currently under construction include: Ominato Port in northwestern Honshu; Uraga Port outside Yokosuka, at the entrance of Tokyo Bay; "Johnson" Airport near Irumagawa City (northwest of Tokyo); and "Matsukigahama" Airport outside Niigata.
	The extent to which the United States is frantically turning Japan into its main war base in the Far East can be seen from the following: the two ports of Ominato and Niigata were completed in May and can accommodate 10,000-ton U.S. warships. At the same time, the repair work on the huge naval and land terminals in Maizuru and Sasebo has also been completed.
	These ports are still being expanded, surrounded by all the subordinate bases along the west coast of Japan. The construction of large army barracks in Yokosuka and Fukuoka was completed at the end of August, and the cost of this construction was also borne by the Japanese government.
	The fact that this string of bases is being built clearly shows that the separate peace treaty with Japan proposed by U.S. President Truman on September 14 is a big deception, aimed at permanently occupying Japan under the guise of the United States signing an agreement with a supposedly "autonomous" Japan.
	At the same time, it is very obvious that the huge financial expenditures due to the construction of military bases will further deteriorate the living standards of the Japanese people. The prices of many major commodities have already increased by 40 percent or more compared to the levels before the outbreak of the Korean War. Currently, there are approximately 13 million unemployed people in Japan. The 25 billion yen required for the construction of military facilities by the United States alone accounts for about 5 percent of Japan's national budget for the next year, and one-sixth of this budget has already fallen into the pockets of the United States in the form of "occupation fees."

### 美在日本大建新军事基地  所需经费达二百五十亿日元  吉田政府要让日本人民负担

　　美在日本大建新军事基地
    所需经费达二百五十亿日元
    吉田政府要让日本人民负担
    【新华社六日讯】据电通社旧金山四日讯：目前日本西海岸正在建立一大串新的美国陆、海、空军基地，需款二百五十亿日元。这笔费用将由日本的纳税人支付。为此，吉田政府已决定增加老百姓的赋税，并提高日本国营铁路的运费百分之六十五。
    这种基地网连绵地贯穿在日本群岛的北海道、本州以及九州三大岛的西海岸的全部。这些基地大部位于下列地区：北海道岛北端的稚内区；北海道西部包括石狩湾全部的小樽区；本州西北的船川港；面对佐渡岛的本州的新澙区（佐渡岛已被美国变为巨大的战争前线基地，美国并特别注意在该岛东湾的夷港建立海军基地和在西湾的河原田港附近建立大空军基地）；舞鹤地区，其中包括京都西北的若狭湾全部；广岛以北、西部面对朝鲜釜山港的滨田；以及九州西北的福冈——佐世保地区。
    目前正在建立巨大的军事设备的港口有：本州西北的大凑港；东京湾的出口、横须贺郊外的浦贺港；入间川市（按在东京西北）附近的“约翰逊”机场；新澙郊外的“松琦滨”机场。
    美国疯狂地把日本变成它在远东的主要战争基地，可从下列一事看出：大凑和新澙两个港口在五月间已改建完成，可使一万吨的美国军舰停泊。同时，舞鹤和佐世保的巨大的水陆码头的修理工作，亦已竣工。
    目前这些港口仍在继续扩大着，其周围有沿日本西海岸的一切附属基地环绕着。在横须贺和福冈的庞大的陆军营房工程，已于八月底竣工，而这笔建筑费用，也是由日本政府负担的。
    建立这一大串基地的事实，清楚地表明：九月十四日美国总统杜鲁门所提出的单独对日和约，实是一个大骗局，旨在使美国与假冒“自主的”日本签订协定的掩盖下，永远占领日本。
    同时，十分明显的是：因建造军事基地而支出庞大的财政经费，将使日本人民的生活水准进一步恶化。许多主要货品的价格已经比朝鲜战争爆发的以前水平增高了百分之四十或更多。目前，日本约有一千三百万失业者。仅美国建立军事设备所需的二百五十亿日元，就占了日本下一年度国家预算的百分之五左右，而这预算中六分之一的款项，已以“占领费”的形式，落入美国的腰包。
