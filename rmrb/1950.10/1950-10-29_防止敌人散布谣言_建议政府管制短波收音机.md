　　Prevent the Enemy from Spreading Rumors
    Suggest Government Control of Shortwave Radios
    To the Editor:
    Although the US-Chiang reactionary armed forces have been completely eliminated on the Chinese mainland, they still dream of making a comeback and are constantly using various methods to carry out their conspiracies and sabotage activities against the new China. One of their main methods is to fabricate and spread rumors in an attempt to disturb people's minds and disrupt our social order. Especially since the US imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, there have been even more rumors. The enemy's methods of spreading rumors are nothing more than direct fabrication and widespread circulation by special agents lurking in various places, and the use of the Voice of America and Taiwan Chiang bandit radio stations to broadcast all kinds of absurd news. Under the suppression of the People's Government, the special agents' rumors will gradually disappear in the future. We should also promptly ban the enemy's use of radio stations to broadcast fictional news and slanderous remarks, otherwise it will be detrimental to our people. In order to safeguard the interests of the people, I, as a member of the people, specifically suggest that all privately owned shortwave radios be investigated and registered by specialized personnel appointed by the competent authorities, and then be appropriately controlled, so as to avoid spreading reactionary heresies that poison the minds of the Chinese people and harm the people.

　　防止敌人散布谣言
    建议政府管制短波收音机编辑同志：
    美蒋反动武装虽在中国大陆被彻底消灭，但它还梦想死灰复燃，还在不断地用各式各样的方法对新中国进行其阴谋破坏活动，而其主要方式之一，就是捏造与散布谣言，以图扰乱人心，破坏我社会秩序。特别是在美帝发动侵朝战争以后，谣言更多。敌人散布谣言的方法，不外由潜伏各地的特务直接捏造到处流传和利用美国之音和台湾蒋匪电台广播各种荒谬新闻。对特务造谣，在人民政府镇压下，此后当可逐渐敛迹。对敌人利用电台广播虚构消息与诬蔑谰言，我们也应从速加以取缔，否则对我们人民是不利的。为了维护人民利益，我以人民一分子的立场，特建议凡私有短波收音机者，一律由主管机构遴派专门人员进行调查登记后，予以适当的管制，以免散布毒害中国人民思想的反动邪说，为害人民。
