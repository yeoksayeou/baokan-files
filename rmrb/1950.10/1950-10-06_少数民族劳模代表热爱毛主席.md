　　Minority Labor Model Representatives Love Chairman Mao
    Zhao Ying
    Minority nationalities in the great family of the motherland have now obtained their rightful place, no longer subject to contempt and oppression. They wholeheartedly love and are grateful to the great leader who led them to liberation and freedom—Chairman Mao.
    Chairman Mao is universally held in the highest esteem among the minority nationalities. This can be seen among the representatives attending this labor model conference in Beijing. A Uyghur representative who understands the Han language bought many of Chairman Mao's works. He firmly stated: "We must respond to Chairman Mao's call, work hard to develop industrial production, and build Xinjiang in a planned way!" A Kazakh representative enthusiastically described the tall steeds and flocks of sheep in their livestock farms. He said, "With Chairman Mao's leadership, our country will be well-built." A Hui representative said, "After the conference, I must bring back Chairman Mao's great spirit and the glorious deeds of heroes and model workers from various places, not only for ourselves to know, but also to promote it among the masses, so that everyone knows and everyone learns."
    When the minority representatives learned that Chairman Mao was inviting them to dinner, everyone changed their clothes, dressed very neatly, and went to the barber shop to get a haircut and shave. They believed that Chairman Mao was the savior of the people, a great leader, and it was a supreme honor to meet Chairman Mao for the first time. A Uyghur representative even practiced what to say when he met Chairman Mao and how to say it. He struggled to say, "Wish you health, Chairman Mao, cheers!" After being corrected by the comrades who were hosting them, he finally said, "Wish Chairman Mao health, cheers!" He wrote it down word by word and practiced it repeatedly until the car arrived at the entrance of the banquet venue.
    After meeting Chairman Mao, a Hui representative said excitedly, "I saw Chairman Mao and wanted to say a lot of things, but I don't know what happened, I was anxious but couldn't say anything. I just kept clapping my hands until they were swollen." "In the past, who would have looked at us poor people? Now Chairman Mao personally comes to the meeting to speak. Every word he says is for us to live a good life. This is truly a world-shaking event! We Hui people can be considered to have stood up. After I go back, I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions and do a good job in production. Growing vegetables and fruits is my specialty. The apples I grow have thin skin and are sweet and fragrant. Next time there is a labor model conference, I will strive to be a labor model again and present apples to Chairman Mao and to the comrades."
    The minority representatives received many gifts from the conference. They admired each item and carefully stored them to take back. One representative was frowning and hesitating, as he was thinking about how to preserve Chairman Mao's portrait. He put Chairman Mao's portrait in his bundle for fear of crushing it, took it out and put it in his box, but the box was broken and he was afraid it would get wet from the rain. In the end, he decided to wrap it in many newspapers and carry it in his hands to take back. He raised Chairman Mao's portrait and shouted loudly, "Chairman Mao, we will always follow you, follow your path forward, and under your leadership, give full play to our wisdom and fight to the end to build our new country."

　　少数民族劳模代表热爱毛主席
    赵莹
    少数民族在祖国的大家庭中，如今已经得到了他们应有的地位，再不受人轻视欺压了。他们由衷地热爱、感戴领导他们获得解放与自由的伟大领袖——毛主席。
    毛主席在少数民族之中，普遍受到最高的崇敬，这在来京出席此次劳模会议的代表中就可以看出来，一位懂得汉族语文的维吾尔族代表买了很多毛主席的著作，他坚决表示：“一定要响应毛主席的号召，努力开展工业生产，有计划地建设新疆！”哈萨克族的代表热情地叙述他们畜牧场中高大的骏马和羊群。他表示：“有毛主席的领导，我们的国家就会建设好。”一位回族代表说：“开完会我一定要把毛主席的伟大精神带回去，把各地英雄模范们的光荣事迹带回去，不但我们自己要知道，而且要推广到群众中，让大家都知道，让大家都学习。”
    当那些少数民族代表知道了毛主席请他们吃饭时，每个人都换了衣服，穿得很是整洁，并且到理发馆理发、剃胡子，他们认为：毛主席是人民的救星、伟大的领袖，第一次去见毛主席是无上的光荣。一位维吾尔族的代表还练习着见了毛主席时说什么话，如何说法，他吃力地说着：“祝健康，毛主席，干一杯！”经招待他们的同志矫正，才说出：“祝毛主席健康，干一杯！”他用笔一个字一个字的写下来反复地练习着，一直到汽车开到宴会处的门前。
    见了毛主席后，一个回族代表激动地说：“我看见了毛主席，想要说很多话，可是也不知怎么搞的，心里着急却总说不出话来，两只手尽拍掌，把手都拍肿了。”“从前我们这些穷苦人，谁能看得上眼？如今毛主席亲自到会场上讲话，他说的每一句话，都是为了我们人民生活过得好，这真是翻天覆地的大事啊！我们回民算站起来了。回去后我一定依着毛主席的指示好好的搞生产。种菜、种瓜果、是我的拿手，我栽培的苹果，皮薄，味又甜又香，等下次开劳模会议，我还争取做劳模，就拿苹果献给毛主席，送给同志们。”
    少数民族代表们，从大会收到了许多礼品，他们一件件的欣赏着，妥藏着带回去。一个代表在蹙眉踌躇，原来正在想如何保藏毛主席的像片。他把毛主席的像片放到包袱里怕压坏，取下来放到箱子里，箱子是个破箱子，又怕雨淋湿坏，最后他决定用许多的报纸包着拿在手中带回去。他举起毛主席的像片，高声喊：“毛主席，我们永远跟着你，跟着你的道路前进，在你领导下，发挥出我们的智慧，为建设我们的新国家而奋斗到底。”
