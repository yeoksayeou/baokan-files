Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. Czech Republic's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Fierlinger sent a telegram to Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of our Central People's Government to offer congratulations. The telegram is as follows: To Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Beijing:

　　On the occasion of the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, please accept my heartfelt congratulations. This moment brings to mind the long and heroic struggle of the valiant Chinese people, which resulted in a great victory that not only shattered the facade of the reactionary ruling system in China but also profoundly shook the position of world imperialists throughout Asia. The heavy blow dealt to U.S. imperialism by the Chinese people's victory can be evidenced by its activities aimed at undermining China's territorial integrity and its repeated and illegal obstruction of the participation of Chinese representatives in the United Nations. The Czech people feel deeply indignant at such aggression and illegal acts, and with love and joy, they watch the great development of your country. The people of our two countries will stand unshakably in the ranks of the world's peace and progress camp headed by the powerful Soviet Union. The sincere friendship between the Chinese and Czech people will eternally exist and develop in the struggle against imperialist wars of aggression and oppression, and in the struggle to consolidate the forces of world peace, progress, and true democracy.

　　Fierlinger, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic
　　September 30, 1950

　　捷克副总理兼外长费林格贺电
    【新华社二日讯】捷克共和国副总理兼外交部部长费林格致电我中央人民政府周恩来总理兼外长祝贺。电文如下：北京中华人民共和国政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来先生：
    值此中华人民共和国建国一周年之际，谨向您致衷心的祝贺。此刻使人想到英勇的中国人民长期英勇的斗争，结果是得到了伟大的胜利，它不仅是粉碎了反动派在中国统治制度的假面目，而且同时深深地动摇了世界帝国主义者在全亚洲的地位。中国人民的胜利所给予美帝国主义的沉重打击可以由其旨在破坏中国领土完整的活动中，以及其百般非法阻挠中国代表参加联合国一事中得到证明。捷克人民对此等侵略与非法行为深感愤慨，并以爱戴与欢欣之心情注视着贵国伟大的发展。贵我两国人民将不可动摇地站立在以强大苏联为首的全世界和平与进步阵营的行列中。中捷两国人民的真挚友谊将在反对帝国主义侵略战争与压迫的斗争中；在巩固全世界和平进步与真正民主的力量斗争中永远地存在与发展。
    捷克共和国副总理兼外交部部长  费林格
    一九五○年九月三十日
