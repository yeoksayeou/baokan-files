　　Guangzhou and Wuhan Achieve Success in Unemployment Relief
　　Nearly 40,000 Workers Receive Assistance
　　Significant Reduction in Unemployed Workers in Wuxi, Suzhou, and Other Places

    [Our Newspaper] According to the Zhongnan Worker Daily: Guangzhou and Guangdong Province have achieved remarkable results in their work to provide relief to unemployed workers. A total of more than 22,000 workers have received jobs or relief. Biases that occurred in the relief work in various places have been gradually examined and corrected. The province is continuing to carry out relief work.

    In Guangzhou, a total of 36,149 unemployed workers have been registered. With the approval of the Guangzhou Unemployment Relief Committee, 6,075 workers and their families have received regular relief, 2,150 people have been placed in jobs, 6,087 people have received work relief, 471 people have been helped with grain loans for production, and 1,379 workers from other provinces have been given travel subsidies to return home. The committee also helped some unemployed workers to study so that they could participate in relief work. In other parts of Guangdong Province, 6,069 unemployed workers have received emergency relief grain from local governments, work relief, and organized production for self-salvation.

    In the future, the focus of Guangzhou's relief work will be on "work relief." Democratic management and financial transparency will be implemented in the work relief teams. Workers will formulate their own labor discipline, and bad elements will be prevented from exploiting workers through the contract system. Workers participating in work relief production will receive six kilograms of rice per day. Those who bring their own tools will receive an additional one-sixth of their wages. Those who work harder and save tools will be rewarded. In addition, the relief committee plans to establish a job placement agency to help unemployed workers find jobs, and to hold cadre training classes, technical research classes, and spare-time schools.

    In some places in Guangdong Province, local governments have not made a good study of the State Council's instructions on providing relief to unemployed workers and relief measures, and the relief organizations are not sound. In some places, no one handles registration or does not review it after registration. When distributing relief grain, there is unfairness. Some local cadres view relief work as a temporary task, and consider it finished after the relief grain is distributed; or they view it as a purely construction project, using a lot of relief grain to carry out one project, while very few workers are relieved. The Provincial Unemployment Relief Committee has instructed various places to examine and correct the above shortcomings.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 7th] Of the more than 18,000 registered unemployed workers in Wuhan, more than 17,000 have found jobs or received relief. A total of about 13,000 people have received help and relief from the People's Government, with the most participating in work relief, reaching more than 4,800 people, and more than 3,900 people receiving subsidized relief grain. The Wuhan Unemployment Relief Office has issued a total of more than 2 million kilograms of relief grain. In addition, more than 4,000 unemployed workers have automatically found jobs or returned to work due to improved market transactions. The remaining few unemployed workers who have not yet been placed have maintained contact with the Unemployment Relief Office and are waiting for job referrals.

    Before August, Wuhan's work relief work was inefficient due to a lack of sound organization and leadership and insufficient political education for workers. Sometimes workers worked only three hours a day, averaging only 0.25 cubic meters of earth per person per day, only one-twelfth of the normal standard. Since the change from a daily wage system to a piece-rate contract system in late August, the situation has changed. In particular, the power of the industrial unions has been used to establish relief branches, and the unemployed workers who originally participated in work relief have been reorganized by the industrial unions. Under the leadership of the industrial unions, according to the voluntary combination of unemployed workers and taking into account the region, contract teams are formed to contract projects from the Municipal Construction Bureau, and contract contracts are signed. As a result, the production efficiency of work relief projects has been greatly improved, with an average of two cubic meters of earth per person per day. Workers with strong working ability can get eight kilograms of rice a day. In order to improve work efficiency, the workers participating in the work relief project automatically formulated labor discipline, and the order was good. At present, political education for unemployed workers in Wuhan is still not good, which has led to factional control in individual contract teams.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th] Due to the beginning of the improvement of business conditions and the government's relief, the number of unemployed workers in Wuxi, Suzhou, Changzhou, Zhenjiang and other cities in southern Jiangsu has gradually decreased, and the difficulties in life have gradually been alleviated. The number of unemployed workers in these four cities reached a maximum of 59,244 in March and April, and had decreased to 25,300 by the beginning of September, most of whom had found jobs or received relief. From late May to early September, 9,045 people in Wuxi were employed with the assistance of the People's Government. During this period, the people's governments and trade unions in various places mobilized more than 8,400 unemployed workers to return to their hometowns for production; introduced 2,479 people to public and private enterprises in Northeast China; and more than 5,700 people participated in work relief projects such as road repairs and river dredging, and self-help production such as weaving towels.

　　广州武汉救济失业工作有成绩
    近四万工人得到救济
    无锡苏州等地失业工人显著减少
    【本报讯】据中南工人日报消息：广州市及广东省救济失业工人工作，获得显著成绩。总计已有两万二千余工人得到职业或救济。各地在救济工作中发生的偏向，已经逐步检查纠正。全省正继续开展救济工作。
    广州市已登记的失业工人计三六、一四九人，经该市救济失业工人委员会批准经常救济的工人及其家属共六、○七五人，介绍工作的二、一五○人，以工代赈的六、○八七人，借粮帮助生产的四七一人，辅助旅费返乡的外省工人一、三七九人。该会并帮助了部分失业工人学习，使其参加救济工作。广东省其他各地失业工人，经各地方人民政府拨粮急赈、以工代赈及组织生产自救的共六、○六九人。
    今后，广州市救济工作重点，将放在“以工代赈”上。工赈队内实行民主管理、财政公开，由工人自己订立劳动纪律，并防止坏分子利用包工制剥削工人。参加工赈生产的工人，每人每日工资六斤米，自带工具的增加工资六分之一，多劳多得、节约工具者有奖。另外，救济委员会并计划成立职业介绍所，帮助失业工人就业；举办干部训练班、技术研究班及业余学校。
    广东省有些地方的政府因对政务院颁发的关于救济失业工人的指示及救济办法未作很好的研究，救济机构亦不健全，有些地方无人办理登记或登记后不审查，在发救济粮时，发生苦乐不均现象。有些地方干部对救济工作是临时任务观点，发完救济粮就算了事；或者是单纯的建设工程观点，用许多救济粮举办一件工程，而被救济的工人却为数极少。该省救济失业工人委员会对上述缺点已指示各地检查纠正。
    【新华社汉口七日电】武汉市登记的一万八千多失业工人中已有一万七千余人找到职业或得到救济。总计得到人民政府帮助和救济的约有一万三千人，其中参加以工代赈的最多，达四千八百多人，得到补助救济粮的有三千九百余人。武汉市失业工人救济处前后发出的救济粮共二百多万斤。另有四千多失业工人因市场交易好转，已自动找到职业或复工。其余尚未得到安插的少数失业工人已与失业工人救济处保持联系，等待介绍职业。
    武汉市的以工代赈工作在八月份以前，曾因缺乏健全的组织领导和对工人进行政治教育不够，工作效率不高。有时工人一天只工作三小时，每人每日平均作零点二五方土，仅及普通标准工十二分之一。自八月下旬将计日工资制改为计件包工制后，情况即有改变，特别是运用产业工会的力量，分别成立救济分会，将原参加以工代赈的失业工人经各产业工会整编，在各产业工会领导下，根据失业工人自愿结合并照顾地区组成包工队，向市建设局包工，签定包工合同。结果使工赈工程的生产效率大为提高，每人每日平均作两方土。工作能力强的工人每天可得到八斤米。为提高工作效率，参加工赈工程的工人均自动订立劳动纪律，秩序良好。目前武汉市对失业工人的政治教育仍然不好，致使个别包工队中发生帮派把持现象。
    【新华社上海七日电】因工商业经营情况开始好转和政府的救济，苏南无锡、苏州、常州、镇江等城市失业工人数量逐渐减少，生活困难也逐渐减轻。这四个城市在三、四两月中失业工人数最高达五万九千二百四十四人，至九月初已减少至二万五千三百人，其中大部失业工人也已找到职业或得到救济。无锡市在五月下旬至九月初，陆续有九千零四十五人在人民政府协助下就业。各地人民政府和工会在这一时期共动员八千四百多户失业工人回乡生产；介绍了二千四百七十九人到东北各公私营企业就业；另有五千七百多人参加了修路、浚河等工赈工程和代织毛巾等生产自救工作。
