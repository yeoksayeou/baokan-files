Xinhua News Agency, dated 29th: Under the leadership and assistance of the relevant departments of the Central People's Government, the national cotton textile industry has overcome numerous difficulties in the past year, and production has largely returned to normal. At present, the actual operating rate of public and private cotton textile industries nationwide has reached 82.4% for spindles and 84.2% for looms. The total output of yarn and cloth has approached the highest level of yarn and cloth output during the Kuomintang rule before liberation; the yarn and cloth output of state-owned textile factories has exceeded the yarn and cloth output during the Kuomintang rule. Among them, the output of Tianjin China Textile Company in May this year, compared with the output during the Kuomintang rule in November 1947, exceeded cotton yarn by 48.34% and cotton cloth by 36.95%.

The process of production recovery in the cotton textile industry has suffered extremely serious difficulties. The main problems were insufficient supply of raw cotton and sluggish sales of products. To this end, the relevant departments of the People's Government have provided tremendous assistance to public and private cotton textile industries in various places. In order to supply the raw materials necessary for various cotton textile factories to maintain production, the People's Government vigorously organized the purchase of raw cotton throughout the country. According to incomplete statistics from January to September this year, state-owned trading companies purchased more than 2.8 million dan of raw cotton in various places. Over the past year, the Central People's Government has also formulated raw cotton supply plans for public and private factories across the country based on the specific circumstances of various parties in order to use raw cotton in a planned manner. In order to maintain the production of the cotton textile industry, the People's Government has spared no effort to subsidize certain funds and massively held "processing on behalf" businesses through public enterprises. In June and July this year, the amount of "processing on behalf" in private textile factories across the country accounted for about 80% of the total number of spindles and looms in operation in private factories. In July this year, the amount of entrusted processing by the North China Branch of the State-owned Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company accounted for 95.88% of the actual number of spindles operated by public and private textile factories in the five provinces of North China and Beijing and Tianjin. From January to September this year, state-owned enterprises in various places paid for the processing of approximately 3.91 million dan of raw cotton and more than 140,000 pieces of cotton yarn; in addition, in order to solve the difficulty in selling cotton textile products, state-owned trading companies in various places purchased approximately 2.84 million pieces of cotton cloth and approximately 87,000 pieces of cotton yarn from January to mid-September.

Due to the bumper harvest of new cotton and the strong sales of yarn and cloth, the cotton textile industry has now passed its most difficult period. However, the production and operation of the industry still needs to be greatly improved. First of all, the production of products should be more adapted to the needs of the broad masses of farmers.

　　中央人民政府大力领导与帮助
    全国棉纺织业恢复正常生产
    公私纱锭织机的实际开工率占总数百分之八十以上全部纱布产量接近解放前国民党统治时的最高水平
    【新华社二十九日讯】全国棉纺织工业在中央人民政府各有关部门的领导和帮助之下，一年来克服重重困难，生产已大体上恢复正常状态。目前全国公私棉纺织业实际开工率，纱锭已达总数的百分之八十二点四，织机已达百分之八十四点二。全部纱布产量已接近于解放前国民党统治时期纱布产量的最高水平；国营纺织工厂的纱布产量则已超过国民党统治时期的纱布产量。其中天津中纺公司今年五月产量较一九四七年十一月国民党统治时期产量，棉纱超过百分之四十八点三四，棉布超过百分之三十六点九五。
    棉纺织工业生产恢复生产的过程中曾遭受极严重的困难。其中主要的是原棉不能充分供应和产品销路不畅。人民政府各有关部门曾为此对各地公私棉纺织业作了巨大的帮助。为供给各棉纺织厂维持生产所必需的原料，人民政府曾在全国范围内大力组织了收购原棉的工作。据今年一月到九月不完全统计，国营贸易企业在各地收购的原棉达二百八十余万市担。一年来，中央人民政府并根据各方面的具体情况，拟订了全国公私营工厂的原棉供应计划，以求有计划地使用原棉。为维持棉纺织业生产，人民政府更不惜赔贴一定资金，通过公营企业，大规模地举办了“代纺代织”的加工业务。在今年六、七月份，全国私营纺织厂中“代纺代织”的数量已占全部私营厂开工纺锭数织布机台数的百分之八十左右。今年七月间，国营花纱布公司华北区公司委托加工的数量占华北五省及北京、天津两市公私营纺织工厂实开纱锭数的百分之九十五点八八。各地国营企业在今年一月至九月为加工付出的原棉约达三百九十一万余担，棉纱十四万余件；此外，为解决棉纺业产品销售困难，各地国营贸易企业在一月到九月中收购了的棉布约二百八十四万余匹，棉纱约八万七千余件。
    由于新棉丰收，纱布销售转旺，目前棉纺织业已度过最困难的时期。但是该业的生产经营尚须大力加以改进，首先是生产品应更多地适应广大农民的需要。
