　　Chairman Mao Waves to Us!
　　——A Record of the People's Air Force Participating in the National Day Parade in the Capital
　　People's Air Force News Reporter Hou Zupai
　　"The Communist Party and Chairman Mao, under extremely difficult national financial and economic circumstances, have nurtured us—the Air Force—with boundless care. Today—the first National Day after the birth of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Mao is inspecting our achievements on Tiananmen Square in Beijing on behalf of the people of the whole country. We must show all the skills the Party has taught us and earn 'Chairman Mao waving to us.'" This was the statement made by Comrade Yao Changchuan, the squadron leader of a certain air force unit participating in the National Day parade, before takeoff.
　　When this air force unit received the order from the People's Revolutionary Military Commission to participate in the National Day parade in the capital, every comrade felt extremely happy. They were so excited they were speechless, silently redoubling their efforts to prepare for this glorious task. Pilots, navigators, communicators, gunners, and mechanics all made guarantees: we are a part of the first batch of air force personnel vigorously cultivated by Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government. This time, we have received our first task, and we are not only determined but also confident to complete it. During our training period, Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country gave us boundless care and encouragement. Participating in the parade this time is like taking an exam as elementary school students, and we must earn the teacher's applause.
　　The results of the exam were announced. On the first National Day of the great People's Republic of China, the problem was answered above the capital with the applause of Chairman Mao and all the people of Beijing.
　　On the morning of September 30th, a certain air force base was filled with joy. The planes participating in the parade today were quietly parked around the airport. The pilots in black leather jackets and blue pants, tanned red and black, and the mechanics covered in oil stains, were busy making preparations before takeoff. At 8:30 a.m., the navigator reported the entire procedure for participating in the parade to all personnel, and then they took cars to their respective parking locations. At 9:25 a.m., five minutes after the red signal was released, the quiet airport was immediately filled with the roar of aircraft engines, and the aircraft began to taxi onto the runway.
　　At this time, the commander reported the weather conditions and precautions, and the navigator explained the task specifically and clearly again, and everyone returned to their original planes to await orders.
　　At 11:25 a.m., the runway, emitting the slightly fragrant smell of aviation fuel, was once again filled with the roar of heated engines. At thirty-one minutes, the lead plane began to take off, followed closely by a squadron, one plane after another taking to the air. Another squadron also took off. Looking out from the rear window of the navigator's plane, the sight of the great Mao Zedong's eagle team soaring freely in the beautiful blue sky of the motherland was incredibly gratifying. After forming up in the air at a certain location, the air force participating in the parade advanced towards the capital with millisecond accuracy. At 12:03, the golden and gray buildings of Beijing, shrouded in light smoke, were faintly visible. At exactly six minutes, the squadron of aircraft flew over Tiananmen Square in neat formation. At this time, we saw Chairman Mao waving to us, and applause erupted from the rostrum; on East and West Chang'an Avenue, a dark stream of the People's Liberation Army was passing through. At this time, all the services and arms of the People's Liberation Army, including the army, navy, and air force, were presented before Chairman Mao and the people. Comrade Wang Wennan, the communicator on the plane, said: Chairman Mao, look! Our air force has gradually been established under your education and training! We are redoubling our efforts to await your and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's orders.
　　At 12:30, after successfully completing the parade mission, the planes landed safely at an airport at a certain location. The mechanics ran up with great enthusiasm to greet their companions—the flight personnel and the planes—and were very satisfied with their performance in the parade.

　　毛主席向我们招手！
    ——记人民空军参加国庆日首都检阅
    人民空军社记者  侯祖沛
    “共产党和毛主席在国家财政经济极端困难的情况下，以无限的关心培育了我们——空军。今天——中华人民共和国诞生后的第一个国庆节，毛主席代表全国人民在北京天安门上检查我们的成绩，我们一定要拿出党教给我们的全副本领来，博得‘毛主席向我们招手’”。这是参加国庆节阅兵典礼的空军某部大队长姚长川同志在起飞前的谈话。
    当这部分空军接到人民革命军事委员会给了他们参加国庆节首都阅兵典礼的命令后，每个同志都感到无比的高兴，他们兴奋得没有话说，默不作声地加倍努力做好准备工作，来迎接这光荣的任务。飞行员、领航员、通讯员、射击员、机械人员全都提出了保证：我们是毛主席、中国共产党、中央人民政府大力培养起来的首批空军人员的一部，这次接到交给我们的第一个任务，我们不但有决心而且有信心去完成。在我们学习期中，毛主席和全国人民曾给予我们无限的关心和鼓励，这回参加检阅正好像小学生参加考试一样，我们一定要博得教员向我们鼓掌。
    考试的结果公布了，伟大的中华人民共和国第一个国庆日，在首都的上空，经毛主席和全北京人民的掌声，答复了这个问题。
    九月三十日清晨，某空军基地洋溢着一片欢欣，机场周围安静地停着今天参加检阅的飞机，穿着黑色皮夹克、蓝色裤子的、晒得红黑的、快活的飞行员们和满身油迹的机械人员们，忙着做起飞前的准备工作。八时半，领航员向全体人员报告参加检阅的全部程序后，就分搭汽车奔赴自己停机地点。九时二十五分，在红色信号放射后五分钟，安静的机场上，登时掀起飞机发动机的怒吼声，飞机开始滑上跑道。
    这时，指挥员报告了气候和应注意的事项，领航员又把任务具体、明晰地说了遍，大家就返原机等待命令。
    十一时二十五分，在散发着微带芬芳的航空用油的跑道上，又充满了烧热了的发动机的吼声。三十一分领队机开始起飞，紧接在后面的一个大队也一架一架临空，另一个大队也起飞了。从领航机的后座玻璃窗中望出去，在祖国美丽的蓝色天空，自由自在的翱翔着伟大的毛泽东的神鹰队，令人感到无比的欣慰。在某地空中编队后，参加检阅的空军以时间不差毫秒的准确性向首都前进。十二时零三分，笼罩在轻烟中的、金黄色的和灰色的北京的建筑物，已隐约可见了。六分正，大队飞机以整齐的队形飞过天安门的上空，这时我们看到毛主席在向我们招手，主席台上下纷纷鼓掌；东西长安街正在通过黑压压的一股人民解放军的铁流。这时，人民解放军陆海空军各种兵种全呈现在毛主席和人民的面前了。机上的通讯员王文楠同志说道：毛主席，您瞧！我们空军在您的教育和培养下，已经逐渐成立了！我们正加倍努力，以等待你和朱总司令的命令。
    十二时三十分，飞机于胜利完成检阅任务后，安然降落在某地机场上，机械人员们以高度的热情跑上来迎护他们的侣伴——飞行人员和飞机。并且很满意于他们受检阅的成绩。
