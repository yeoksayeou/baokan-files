    I.
    Man is great. – Gorky said something to that effect. Others have said it too.
    However, I feel that to truly experience the meaning of this greatness, there is perhaps no better way than through the person who has transformed from a slave into a hero.
    Because here, we truly experience man's greatest victory and greatest creation.
    For example, the more than eight hundred combat heroes and model workers gathered in the capital for the conference, seven or eight out of ten were shepherds, hired laborers, coolies, poor peasants, and child brides in the past; they were genuine slaves who were oppressed, whipped, and suffered from hunger and cold. But now, they have become the most outstanding representatives of the great Chinese people, meritorious servants of the new China, heroes respected by hundreds of millions of people and admired by the people of the world.
    Man creates miracles, but is there a greater miracle than this?
    Every combat hero and labor hero has established extraordinary achievements and created almost unimaginable mythical deeds; but their greatest achievement is to promote the excellent and noble qualities of the Chinese working people, and their most immortal deed is to transform themselves into glorious heroes – great, real people.

    II.
    But we should therefore understand two truths more clearly and strengthen two beliefs.
    First, the Chinese people are one of the finest peoples in the world. Diligent, brave, enduring, tenacious, and full of wisdom and creativity, loving peace, loving freedom, simple, loyal, profound, and so on. The excellent and noble qualities we speak of refer to these spirits.
    This is our foundation, our spiritual homeland, our moral and civilization that we are proud of. This is naturally very important, must be affirmed first, and firmly recognized.
    But it is even more important to recognize the second truth more firmly. This is revolution. It is the liberation of the people and the pursuit of progress from liberation.
    If the people in a slave status do not revolt, do not launch a revolution, and do not carry out a liberation movement and achieve victory, how can they progress, how can they develop the noble and great qualities in themselves and become glorious and brilliant heroes?
    But what is the necessary key in history that enables the people to truly liberate themselves and achieve victory?
    Now anyone can answer this: it is the light of Marxism-Leninism, the leadership of the Communist Party and the great genius Mao Zedong.
    But the most vivid and powerful proof of this truth is the fact that the Chinese people have begun to have a new look and that thousands upon thousands of new heroes and new figures have emerged.
    Every combat hero or labor hero possesses these two necessary conditions, and the light of these two eternally shining truths shines upon each other.
    Combat heroes or labor heroes rely on the noble qualities of the Chinese working people they possess, rely on their own learning and extraordinary efforts, and thus become heroes, become new people.
    However, they rely even more on the education, cultivation, and leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and only then can they become heroes, become new people.
    The excellent qualities of the Chinese people, although a fertile land, have reached a state of drought due to the oppression, obstruction, and destruction of feudal reactionary rule and imperialism, and the education of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is precisely the timely irrigation, and the leadership of the Communist Party revolution is precisely the necessary hoeing, so this land will be revived and will become more fertile, and will begin to grow luxuriant and beautiful new fruit trees.
    Every hero understands his own experience and growth process most thoroughly. When they narrate their combat history, they are people with both love and hate, both sadness and joy. They are the most familiar with anger and hatred, but they are also the ones who most enjoy the joy and happiness of victory and freedom.
    When I listened to the typical reports of the heroes' deeds and saw the smiles on their faces when they talked about the victory of the battle, I felt every time that it was like a mountain that had been covered with snow all winter, and now the snow has been melted, and it is smiling in the spring sunshine.
    The history of every hero is a combination of the history of being oppressed and the history of being educated by Chairman Mao. Isn't it natural that everyone sincerely thanks Chairman Mao and the Communist Party?

    III.
    Man is great, Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin are great.
    The Marxism-Leninism they created is great.
    Their thoughts and work have educated and cultivated new people and new heroes.
    The Chinese people are great, and the Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong is great. He has educated and cultivated and is educating and cultivating new people and new heroes.
    He led the Party and the people to save China. He is a genius creator in military, political, economic, and cultural fields. However, his greatest creative achievement should be said to be these thousands upon thousands of new heroes and new people.

    IV.
    If I have not misunderstood, I feel that every hero and model figure possesses the excellent and noble qualities of the Chinese people, and they are intertwined with the people.
    If I have not misunderstood, I feel that Chairman Mao concentrates the qualities and characteristics of all the heroes and models; he is the peak of their character.
    I myself believe that I have not misunderstood, so when I think of this relationship, I feel unspeakably happy and at ease.
    I feel that this has a great inspiring power for life and work. I feel that people will therefore increase their desire for life, their enthusiasm for work, and reduce selfish elements.
    When I think of this interactive relationship, I feel that I have increased my love for the motherland and the people. I feel that from here I can better understand our people, and therefore feel closer to Chairman Mao and closer to the Party.
    I feel that work increases people's desire and strength for life, and the desire for life is nothing more than to better understand one's people and be closer to the people. What other meaning is there in life?
    And the feeling of being close to the people and the feeling of being close to Chairman Mao are actually one.
    Work is man's life. But whether it is life or work, what people want to get is spiritual happiness, that is, the feeling of happiness and honor. So, if the result of life and work is to be closer to the people, closer to Chairman Mao, closer to the Party, and closer to comrades, then isn't this the highest meaning?
    Secondly, for example, if you have a friend, and you feel as close and grateful to him as you do to the people and Chairman Mao, then you are living in the noblest friendship. Friendship is also a purpose of life and work; it leads us to a happy life, and it is itself a necessary factor in a happy life.
    In short, loving one's people and the people's leader is necessary for a person in life, if he is no longer a slave, but has been liberated and is happy to work and happy to live.
    I feel that loving the motherland is also such a feeling.
    A life full of this love will be the most fulfilling life. Such a person will be the most substantial person.
    The literature and art that extracts thoughts, emotions, and images from here will be the most creatively brilliant literature and art.

    V.
    The deeds of the various heroes were rare in the past, but in our era, there are countless heroes who have created such deeds, and in the future, there will be ten thousand times more than now. This is the greatest characteristic of our era.
    The history and deeds of each hero are unique and form an outstanding epic. They each contribute to the development and completion of revolutionary heroism, which is the highest spiritual power and creativity of our era.
    This has been irrigated by the blood of the heroes in the revolutionary struggle and all class struggles, and it is also the result of the development of the excellent qualities of the Chinese people, and it is even more achieved under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.
    This is the highest product of the era of people's heroes, and at the same time it is the most morally guiding thought.
    Even if a person's deeds are so outstanding that they are enough to become a hero, if his spirit does not conform to revolutionary heroism, he still cannot become a true new hero. But the spirit of revolutionary heroism is more common in our era, and it will be popularized to everyone, although not everyone will necessarily become a hero.
    This is also one of the characteristics of revolutionary heroism. Our heroes are all produced in the mutual and highly class-loving and mutual assistance of him and his comrades, so every hero understands this truth best: in his heroic achievements, there are how much people's strength and comrades' blood, and at the same time, his heroic behavior is a manifestation of the spirit of selfless sacrifice for the people and for the comrades.
    Therefore, revolutionary heroism is indeed the expression of the highest class consciousness of the revolutionary people. The deep patriotism and the developing internationalism, as well as revolutionary humanitarianism, possessed by our heroes and the people are all the essence, content, and driving force of revolutionary heroism through this line.
    This is why we see revolutionary heroism in the combat heroes and labor heroes, and at the same time we must see deep patriotism, developing internationalism, and revolutionary humanitarianism. And therefore, we feel that the revolutionary heroism of our people is particularly magnificent.
    When I think of our literature and art, I feel that reflecting and expressing this kind of thought and spirit is precisely the goal we must devote all our efforts to achieve.
    For example, the history and deeds of each hero can be written into a masterpiece. But it is not difficult to narrate their deeds, but it is very difficult to reflect their qualities and revolutionary heroism.
    But only literature and art that reflects such qualities and spirit are creative, have a magnificent魄力 and profound thought and atmosphere. Such literature and art have permanent brilliance and vitality. Our nation and country need and can create such literature and art.
    This is also the literature and art of patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary humanitarianism that we require.
    The reason why Lu Xun's works have such brilliance and vitality is because he has already reached this point.
    The reason why Chairman Mao's papers and poems are so brilliant and have a magnificent and profound power, I think, in addition to his thoughts, is also because his emotions and writing power also reflect the qualities and spirit of the Chinese people.
    Let us work hard, study, experience, and learn more about the qualities of the people and the people's heroes and the spirit of revolutionary heroism.

　　杂感

    一
    人是伟大的。——高尔基说过这样意思的话。别的人也说过。
    可是，我觉得，要体验这伟大的意义，恐怕再也没有像在从奴隶变成为英雄的人的身上能体验得那么深切和显明的了。
    因为在这里，我们才真正体验到人的最大的胜利和最大的创造。
    例如这次汇聚到首都来开会的八百多位战斗英雄和劳动模范代表，十之七八在过去都是牧童、雇工、苦力、贫农和童养媳等等，是道地的被压迫、受鞭笞的饥寒交迫的奴隶。然而现在，他们却成为伟大中华人民的最优秀的代表者，新中国的功臣，为亿万人所崇敬、并且为世界人民所敬仰的英雄。
    人是创造奇迹的，可是还有比这更大的奇迹么？
    每一个战斗英雄、劳动英雄，都建立了非凡的功绩，创造了几乎想像不到的神话一般的事迹；可是他们最大的功绩是发扬了中国劳动人民的优良高贵的品质，他们最不朽的事迹是使自己变成为辉煌的英雄——伟大的、真正的人。
    二
    但我们当因此而更明白两个真理，加强两个信念。
    其一，中国人民是世界上最优良的人民之一。勤劳，英勇，坚忍，顽强，并且富有智慧和创造力，爱和平，爱自由，纯朴，忠实，深厚，等等。我们说的优良高贵的品质，就是指的这一些精神。
    这是我们的根底，我们的精神上的国土，我们值得骄傲的道德与文明。这自然是非常重要的，必须首先肯定的，坚定地认识的。
    但更重要的还须更坚定地认识第二个真理。这就是革命。就是人民的翻身和从翻身中求得进步。
    处于奴隶地位的人民，如果不起义，不发动革命，不进行翻身运动而得到胜利，又那里能够进步，能够发扬自己身上的高贵伟大的品质而成为辉煌灿烂的英雄的人？
    可是使人民能够真正翻身而胜利的历史的必要关键，又是什么呢？
    现在是任何人都能够回答的了，这就是马列主义的光照，共产党和伟大天才毛泽东的领导。
    但给这个真理以最鲜明和最有力的证明的，还是中国人民开始有新的面貌和成千成万的新英雄与新人物的出现的这件事实。
    在每一个战斗英雄或劳动英雄的身上都具备着这两个必要的条件，交相辉映着这两个永远发亮的真理的光。
    战斗英雄或劳动英雄，依靠自身所具有的中国劳动人民的高贵品质，依靠自己的学习和非凡的努力，于是成为英雄，成为新的人。
    然而更依靠共产党和毛主席的教育培植与领导，这才能够成为英雄，成为新的人。
    中国人民的优良品质，虽是一块肥沃的土地，然而由于封建反动统治与帝国主义的压制阻遏与摧毁，已经到了枯渴的地步，而马列主义毛泽东思想的教育正是及时的灌溉，共产党的领导革命正是必要的锄掘，于是这土地就苏生而将更肥沃，并且开始茁长着茂盛美丽的新的果树。
    每个英雄都最透彻地明白自己的经历和成长的过程。当他们叙述自己战斗历史的时候，他们都是憎爱相结，悲喜交集的人。他们是最熟悉愤怒与仇恨的人，可也是最享受着胜利与自由的快乐与幸福的人。
    当我听着英雄们的事迹典型报告，看见他们说到战斗的胜利而在脸上流露微笑的时候，我每次都觉得好像一座山，整个冬天都被雪压着，而现在雪已被融解，它正在春天的阳光里微笑一样。
    每个英雄的历史都是被压迫的历史和被毛主席教育的历史所合成的。个个人都那么衷心地感谢毛主席和共产党，难道还不是当然的么？
    三
    人是伟大的，马、恩、列、斯是伟大的。
    他们所创造的马列主义是伟大的。
    他们的思想与工作，教育和培养了新的人与新的英雄。
    中国人民是伟大的，马列主义者的毛泽东是伟大的。他教育培养了和正在教育培养着新的人与新的英雄。
    他领导着党和人民救了中国。在军事、政治、经济、文化各方面，他都是一个天才的创造者。然而他最大的创造成绩，应该说是这成千成万的新的英雄和新的人。
    四
    假如我没有领悟错，我觉得在每一个英雄和模范人物的身上都秉有着中国人民的优良高贵的品质，他们和人民是丝丝缕缕地相交织着的。
    假如我没有领悟错，我觉得在毛主席的身上是集中着所有英雄模范们的品质与性格的，他是他们的品性上的高峰。
    我自己是认为没有领悟错的，因此，当我想到这种关系时，我感到说不出地幸福和安心。
    我觉得这对于生活和工作有一种很大的感召的力量。我觉得人将因此而增加向生活的欲望，对工作的热力，并且减少自私的成份。
    我想到这种交互的关系，我感到自己增加了对祖国和对人民的爱。我觉得从这里我能够更理解我们的人民，并因此而感到和毛主席更亲近，和党更亲近。
    我感到工作是增加人的生活欲望和力量的，而生活的欲望无非是要更理解自己的人民，更与人民相亲近。此外又还有什么生活意义呢？
    而与人民相亲近的感觉和与毛主席相亲近的感觉，其实是一体的。
    工作才是人的生活。但无论说生活也罢，工作也罢，人所要得到的是精神上的快乐，即幸福和荣誉的感觉。所以，假如生活和工作的结果，所得到的是和人民更亲近，和毛主席更亲近，和党更亲近，和同志们更亲近，那这还不是最高的意义么？
    其次，譬如说，你有一个朋友，你对他，像你对人民和毛主席那样感到亲近与感激，那你就生活在最高贵的友爱里面了。友爱也就是生活与工作的一个目的，它是把我们引向幸福生活去的，并且它本身也就是幸福生活的必要因素。
    总之，爱自己的人民和人民的领袖，是一个人在生活上所必需的，假如他不再是奴隶，而是已经翻了身的、乐于工作和乐于生活的人。
    我觉得爱祖国，也就是这样的一种感情。
    富有这种热爱的生活，将是最充实的生活。这样的人将是最有内容的人。
    从这里提取思想、情绪和形象的文艺，将是最有创造性的光辉的文艺。
    五
    各个英雄的事迹，在过去时代都是仅见的，但在我们时代创造这样事迹的英雄却是数不清的，将来将更要千万倍于现在。这是我们时代的最大的一个特征。
    各个英雄的历史和事迹都是各有特色的，自成一部杰出的史诗的。他们各自出力发展和完成革命英雄主义，这革命英雄主义是我们时代的最高的精神力与创造力。
    这是英雄们在革命斗争，一切阶级斗争中用自己的血所灌溉成长的，也是发展了中国人民的优良品质的结果，更是在马列主义毛泽东思想的指导下所达到的。
    这是人民英雄时代的最高的产物，同时又是最具有道德力的指导的思想。
    一个人即使他的事迹突出到足以成为英雄，而如果他的精神不符合革命英雄主义，他就还不能成为真正的新的英雄。但革命英雄主义的精神在我们时代是更为普遍的，它将要普及到每一个人的，虽然并不一定每一个人都成为英雄。
    这也就是革命英雄主义的特色之一。我们的英雄，都是在他和战友们的相互的高度的阶级友爱与互助中产生的，所以每一个英雄都最明白这道理：在他的英雄业绩上有着多少的人民的力量和同志们的血，同时他的英雄行为就是为了人民，为了同志们而忘我地牺牲的精神的表现。
    因此，革命英雄主义的确又是革命人民的最高的阶级觉悟的表现。我们的英雄们和人民所具有的深厚的爱国主义和正在发展着的国际主义，以及革命的人道主义，就都是通过这一线而成为革命英雄主义的本质、内容和动力的。
    这就是我们在战斗英雄和劳动英雄们身上看见革命英雄主义的同时，又一定看见深厚的爱国主义，正在发展着的国际主义和革命的人道主义的原因。并且因此，我们感到我们人民的革命英雄主义是特别雄伟的。
    我又想到我们的文艺，我就觉得反映和表现这种思想和精神正是我们必须付予全力去达到的目标。
    例如每一个英雄的历史和事迹，都能写成一部杰作。但叙写他们的事迹还不难，而反映他们的品质和革命英雄主义却非常不容易。
    但只有反映了这样的品质和精神的文艺，才是有创造性的、有雄伟的魄力和深厚的思想与气度的文艺。这样的文艺是有永久的光辉与生命力的。我们的民族和国家是需要而且能够创造这样的文艺的。
    这也就是我们所要求的爱国主义、国际主义和革命人道主义的文艺。
    鲁迅的作品所以有那样的光辉与生命力，就因为他已经达到了这地步。
    毛主席的论文与诗，所以那样的光辉和有雄伟深厚的力量，我觉得除他的思想以外，也就因为在他的情绪和文字力量上也反映了中国人民的品质和精神的缘故。
    我们努力罢，多研究、体验和学习人民和人民英雄们的品质与革命英雄主义的精神罢。
