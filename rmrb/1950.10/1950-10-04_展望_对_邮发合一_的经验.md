　　"Prospects" on the Experience of "Unification of Postal Service and Distribution"
    (I) Development Overview
    The entire operation of "Prospects" is still in its infancy, and everything is insufficient, and the experience is superficial. The development situation is roughly as follows:
    Our current sales volume is 45,000 copies, which has developed from a base of 5,200 copies in one year. It is expected that it can develop to 80,000 copies by the end of the year. Based on past development experience, it should not be too difficult to achieve this number. From the development process, it can be roughly divided into three stages: The first stage is the exploration period. During this period, our sales volume dropped step by step, all the way to 5,200 copies. The main reason is of course that the content of the publication cannot match the objective conditions, but the lack of understanding of the work by the staff and the lack of planning and foresight in the work are also major reasons. The second stage is the initial development period, which can also be said to be the resurrection period. During this period, we started by intensifying learning to improve the staff's understanding, and gradually determined the general policy of taking the mass line in distribution, making plans, and advancing steadily. At this time, our circulation has increased to 14,000 copies. The third stage is the new development period. During this period, we first signed a postal sales contract with the East China Postal Administration. At the beginning, the sales volume increased by 3,500 copies. Other distribution relationships also helped us develop, and thus it has been developing to today's number, of which 60 percent is developed by the post office. From September 1st, we further handed over all distribution work to the post office. The subsequent development is believed to be able to enter another stage.
    (II) Our Superficial Understanding of Postal Distribution
    According to the experience of the Soviet Union and the old liberated areas such as Shandong, the future of postal distribution of newspapers and periodicals is bright. At present, we should pursue such a bright distribution future in a planned and step-by-step manner.
    The advantages of postal distribution are:
    A. There are widespread and numerous institutions. According to the survey, there are 3,102 post offices at all levels across the country, and there are 23,159 postal offices, postal kiosks, postal stations, and agency offices. These institutions are all working under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government.
    B. There are a large number of staff. According to the report of Minister Zhu Xuefan of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, there are more than 53,000 staff in the post office and more than 20,000 in other distribution agencies. Because of their widespread institutions and large number of personnel, this meets the requirements of universality and depth in distribution, and it is also convenient to collect and settle publication fees. Readers can also buy books or subscribe to periodicals without sending letter postage and remittance fees, reducing the burden.
    C. There are many opportunities to contact readers and have proactive working conditions. Because many postmen have to contact people with letters every day, he will know who reads periodicals, who are the objects he can develop into readers, and after developing into readers, he can also convey the readers' opinions to the publishing house.
    D. Distribution is rapid. The so-called "Unification of Postal Service and Distribution" is to combine general distribution work with delivery work, and the staff of the post office are generally familiar with traffic conditions, and some post offices themselves also have transportation tools.
    E. Precise division of labor and accurate management are the traditional working system of the post office.
    Some of the current shortcomings of the post office:
    A. Distribution work is a newly established business in the post office. Generally speaking, the staff lacks experience and has poor business skills.
    B. Some people do not have enough understanding, do perfunctory work, and some also have deviations in their work, such as purely economic viewpoints and paternalistic viewpoints.
    C. Institutional organization and certain administrative systems restrict the flexibility of work.
    However, taken together, based on previous experience, we believe that the post office has the strength to help us develop distribution work. The important thing at present is how to organize and promote it.

　　“展望”对“邮发合一”的经验
    （一）发展概况
    “展望”的整个业务尚在萌芽期内，一切都还不够，经验是浅薄的。发展的情况大致这样：
    我们目前的销数是四万五千份，这是在一年的时间中，从五千二百份的基础上发展过来的。预期到年底可以发展到八万份。根据过去的发展经验，要达到这个数字大概还不顶困难。从发展的过程来说，大致可分三个阶段：第一阶段是摸索时期，在这时期里，我们的销数步步跌落，一直跌到五千二百份，主要的原因当然是刊物的内容不能配合客观的条件，不过，工作人员缺乏对工作的认识，在工作上无计划无预见，也是主要原因之一。第二阶段是初步发展时期，也可说是起死回生时期，在这时期里，我们从加紧学习提高工作人员的认识入手，慢慢地确定了在发行上走群众路线的总方针，定下计划，稳步前进。这时候，我们的发行量已提高到一万四千份。第三阶段是新发展时期，在这时期里，我们与华东邮政管理局首先签订了邮销合约，一开始，销数就增加了三千五百份，另外的发行关系也帮助我们开展，这样就一直的发展到今天的数字，其中的有百分之六十是邮局发展的。从九月一日起，我们更进一步把发行工作全部交给了邮局，此后的发展，确信当能进入另一阶段。
    （二）我们对邮局发行的粗浅认识
    邮局发行报刊，根据苏联与山东等老区的经验，它的前途是美好的。目前我们应该有计划、有步骤地追求这样一个美好的发行前途。
    邮局发行的有利条件有：
    甲、有普遍众多的机构。据调查，全国有各级邮局三、一○二个，有邮务所、邮亭、邮站、代办所等二万三千一百五十九所，这些机构都是在中央人民政府统一领导下进行工作的。
    乙、有众多的工作人员。根据邮电部朱学范部长的报告，邮局共计有工作人员五万三千余人，其他的发行机构有二万余人。由于他们的机构普遍，人员众多，这正符合了发行上普遍、深入的要求，并且收结刊费也方便。读者又可以不出信函邮寄费与汇费来买书或订阅刊物，减低了负担。
    丙、接触读者的机会多，有主动的工作条件。因为众多的邮递员每天要和有信件的人接触，他会晓得那些人是读期刊的，那些人是他发展为读者的对象，发展为读者之后，他又可以把读者的意见传达给刊社。
    丁、发行迅速。所谓“邮发合一”就是把一般的发行工作与投递工作结合起来，而邮局的工作人员，一般又都熟悉交通情况，有些邮局本身也有运输工具。
    戊、分工精密，管理准确，这是邮局的传统工作制度。
    邮局目前存在着的一些缺点：
    甲、发行工作在邮局是初办的业务，一般的说，工作人员缺乏经验，业务技术差。
    乙、一部分人员认识不够，敷衍工作，也有在工作上发生偏差的，如纯经济观点、包办观点等。
    丙、机构组织与一定的行政制度限制了工作的机动性。
    不过综合起来说，根据以前经验，我们认为邮局是有力量来帮助我们开展发行工作的，目前重要的是怎样组织与推动的问题。
