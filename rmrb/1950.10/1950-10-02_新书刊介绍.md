*The Soviet Land Nationalization System*

The International Bookstore has recently received a new Chinese version of the book: *The Soviet Land Nationalization System*, by Kochetovskaya. The book is divided into four chapters with a total of 237 pages. Chapter One: "The Russian Land Question at the End of the 19th and the Beginning of the 20th Century." The author historically and in detail describes the transition of Russia from the old serfdom's medieval land ownership system to the capitalist system in the decades before the October Revolution and the struggle between these two systems. Chapter Two: "The Lenin-Stalin Party Fights for the Russian Land Nationalization System." This chapter first introduces Marx and Engels' brilliant insights on land nationalization, then describes the Russian bourgeoisie's land nationalization program during the democratic revolution, and finally discusses the Bolshevik Party's land nationalization program in preparation for the October Socialist Revolution. Chapter Three: "The Soviet Union Implements the Land Nationalization System," narrates the process of the Soviet Union implementing the land nationalization policy after the victory of the October Revolution and the increasing improvement of the material life of the Russian working peasants. The final chapter, "Land Nationalization is the Prerequisite for Agricultural Collectivization and the Necessary Condition for Consolidating the Collective Farm System," in this chapter, the author uses facts as a basis to clarify the relationship between land nationalization and the "agricultural collectivization," the decisive step to guide agriculture to socialism, and briefly explains the huge development of Soviet socialist agriculture and its unlimited future. This is an important reference book for understanding the process of implementing the Soviet land nationalization system. (Recommended)
