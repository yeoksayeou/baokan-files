The instructions require all factories and mines to thoroughly inspect and strengthen the defensive equipment of machinery, factory buildings, dormitories, etc. In addition, they must carefully sort out and remove all kinds of flammable and ignition materials, improve the storage and use of dangerous goods such as gunpowder and chemicals, reorganize fire-fighting organizations, improve fire-fighting systems, and hold large-scale fire drills.

They should mobilize the masses, seize the opportunity, and earnestly carry out these tasks, and establish and improve safety responsibility systems and reward and punishment systems through this work.

    【新华社二十六日讯】中央人民政府重工业部为保证冬季生产正常进行和职工冬季健康，于日前指示所属各厂矿迅速作好防火、防冻、防风的准备工作。指示要求各厂矿，除彻底检查和加强机器设备、厂房、宿舍等防御设备外，还要认真整理、清除各种易燃物和引火物，改善火药、化学品等危险物品的保管和使用方法，整顿消防组织，健全消防制度，举行大规模的消防演习。指示指出：今年雨季时有些厂房倒塌，系因去年冬季施工草率所致，今后冬季施工即应注意改进。指示要求各厂矿领导者将防火、防冻、防风工作列为目前重要工作之一，应该发动群众，抓紧时机，认真进行，并通过这一工作建立与健全安全责任制和奖惩制。
