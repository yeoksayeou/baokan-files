Xinhua News Agency, October 26th: Military aircraft of the U.S. invading Korean troops intruded into the airspace of our Liaodong Province multiple times between the 13th and 25th of this month, carrying out wanton strafing and bombing. In response, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a telegram to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie on the 26th, forwarding it to UN General Assembly President Nasrollah Entezam and Security Council President Warren Austin, pointing out that the increasing number of intrusions into our airspace and the strafing and bombing by U.S. planes proves that the U.S. is expanding the war and its crimes have continued to extend towards our Northeast. He specifically lodged another accusation to the UN, demanding that the Security Council immediately take effective measures to stop the crimes of U.S. invading Korean troops' military aircraft from constantly intruding into our airspace, and immediately withdraw U.S. invading Korean troops to extinguish the flames of war expansion. The text of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's telegram is as follows:
    To Mr. Trygve Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations, and forwarded to Mr. Nasrollah Entezam, President of the Fifth General Assembly of the United Nations, and Mr. Warren Austin, President of the Security Council:
    According to reports from the Northeast People's Government, at 14:25 Beijing time on October 15th, four military aircraft of the U.S. invading Korean troops intruded into the airspace above Andong, carrying out low-altitude strafing. At 19:50 on October 16th, one military aircraft of the U.S. invading Korean troops intruded into the airspace above Digou Village, Ji'an County, Liaodong Province. At 23:00 on October 20th, one military aircraft of the U.S. invading Korean troops intruded into Changdian District, Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, dropping one bomb. At 14:07 on the 21st, two military aircraft of the U.S. invading Korean troops intruded into the airspace above Digou Village, Ji'an County, Liaodong Province. At 14:10 on the 22nd, three military aircraft of the U.S. invading Korean troops intruded into the airspace above Haiguan Village, Ji'an County, Liaodong Province. At 15:07 on the 22nd, three military aircraft of the U.S. invading Korean troops intruded into the airspace above Lagushao, Kuandian County. At 10:36 on the 24th, three military aircraft of the U.S. invading Korean troops intruded into the airspace above Digou Village, Ji'an County, Liaodong Province. At 07:25 on the 25th, four military aircraft of the U.S. invading Korean troops intruded into the airspace above Erdaogou, Weisha River District, Linjiang County, Liaodong Province, strafing for one minute, injuring one child and one cow. At 07:26 on the 25th, four military aircraft of the U.S. invading Korean troops intruded into the airspace above Huangbaidianzi Village, Ji'an County.

    I have protested and accused the U.N. Security Council four times on August 27, August 30, September 24, and October 18 this year against the atrocities of U.S. invading Korean troops' military aircraft intruding into Chinese airspace, killing and injuring Chinese people, and damaging Chinese property. The Security Council, due to the U.S.'s manipulation of the majority, has not taken any measures to sanction the U.S.'s aggression against Korea and the expansion of the flames of the Eastern war. On the contrary, the United Nations General Assembly has passed illegal resolutions to support the U.S.'s expansion of the war of aggression against Korea. The increase in the number of intrusions into our airspace and the implementation of strafing and bombing by the U.S. invading Korean troops' military aircraft in the thirteen days from October 13 to 25 proves that the U.S.'s crimes of expanding the war have continued to develop towards our Northeast, which is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. I, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, once again lodge an accusation to the United Nations and demand that the Security Council immediately take effective measures to stop the crimes of U.S. invading Korean troops' military aircraft constantly intruding into our airspace, and immediately withdraw U.S. invading Korean troops to extinguish the flames of war expansion.

                                 Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China
    Zhou Enlai

　　周外长再电联合国
    控诉美机不断犯我领空
    指出美国扩大战争的罪行继续向我东北发展
    要求立即撤退侵朝美军熄灭战争扩大的火焰
    【新华社二十六日讯】美国侵朝军队的军用飞机于本月十三日至二十五日间又多次侵入我国辽东省领空肆行扫射与轰炸。我外交部周恩来部长为此于二十六日致电联合国秘书长赖伊，并转联合国第五届大会主席安迪让及安全理事会主席奥斯汀，指出美机侵入我国领空与实行扫射、轰炸的次数增加，证明美国扩大战争的罪行已经继续向我东北发展，特再度向联合国提出控诉，要求安理会立即采取有效措施，制止美国侵朝军队的军用飞机不断侵入我国领空的罪行，并立即撤退美国侵朝军队，以熄灭战争扩大的火焰。周恩来外长的电文如下：联合国秘书长赖伊先生，并转联合国第五届大会主席安迪让先生及安全理事会主席奥斯汀先生：
    据我东北人民政府报告，十月十五日北京时间十四时二十五分，有美国侵略朝鲜军队军用飞机四架，侵入我安东上空，低飞扫射。十月十六日十九时五十分，有美国侵略朝鲜军队军用飞机一架，侵入我辽东省辑安县地沟村上空。十月二十日二十三时，有侵朝美军的军用飞机一架，侵入我辽东省宽甸县长甸区，投弹一枚。二十一日十四时零七分，有侵朝美军的军用飞机二架，侵入我辽东省辑安县之地沟村上空。二十二日十四时零十分，有侵朝美军的军用飞机三架，侵入我辽东省辑安县之海关村上空。二十二日十五时零七分，有侵朝美军的军用飞机三架，侵入我宽甸县之拉古哨上空。二十四日十时三十六分，有侵朝美军的军用飞机三架侵入我辽东省辑安县之地沟村上空。二十五日七时二十五分，有侵朝美军的军用飞机四架，侵入我辽东省临江县苇沙河区之二道沟上空扫射一分钟，伤小孩一人，牛一头。二十五日七时二十六分有侵朝美军的军用飞机四架，侵入我辑安县黄柏甸子村上空。
    我曾于本年八月二十七日、八月三十日、九月二十四日及十月十八日四次向联合国安全理事会抗议并控诉美国侵朝军队军用飞机侵入中国领空，杀伤中国人民及损坏中国财产的暴行。安全理事会由于美国操纵了多数，一直没有采取任何制裁美国侵略朝鲜和扩大东方战争火焰的措施，相反地，联合国大会竟通过非法决议，支持美国扩大侵略朝鲜的战争。美国侵朝军队军用飞机在十月十三日到二十五日的十三天中，侵入我国领空并实行扫射轰炸的次数的增加，证明美国扩大战争的罪行已经继续向我东北发展，这是中国人民所绝不能容忍的。我代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府再度向联合国提出控诉，并要求：安全理事会立即采取有效措施，制止美国侵朝军队的军用飞机不断侵入我国领空的罪行，并立即撤退美国侵朝军队，以熄灭战争扩大的火焰。
