Xinhua News Agency, New York, 9th—According to TASS, the United Nations General Assembly’s Special Political Committee continued its examination of the so-called “human rights violations case” falsely accusing Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania at its meeting on the 5th. Although many Marshall Plan countries and Latin American countries within the US-UK bloc unanimously supported the slanderous Australian proposal, representatives from even Saudi Arabia and Syria spoke out, criticizing this accusation, which was based on no factual basis and interfered in the internal affairs of the three countries, as illegal, and stated that they would abstain when the Australian proposal was put to a vote. However, the committee, manipulated by the US and UK to form a majority, disregarded the resolute opposition of the Soviet Union and the People’s Democratic countries, and ultimately passed the Australian proposal to carry out slanderous propaganda against Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania.
    The committee is scheduled to meet again on the 9th.

　　联大特别政治委员会会议上
    通过澳诽谤保匈罗提案
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会特别政治委员会五日会议继续审议诬告保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚三国所谓“破坏人权案”，虽然美英集团中许多马歇尔计划国家与拉丁美洲国家代表异口同声地支持诽谤性的澳大利亚提案，但是甚至沙地阿拉伯及叙利亚的代表，也都发言批评这种毫无事实根据而干涉三国内政的控诉案是非法的，并表示表决澳大利亚提案时将弃权。但是由美英操纵多数的委员会，不顾苏联及人民民主国家的坚决反对，最后仍通过对保、匈、罗三国进行诽谤宣传的澳大利亚提案。
    委员会定于九日再行开会。
