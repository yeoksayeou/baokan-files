　　The French Military Cemetery in Bac Ninh
　　By Feigel, Chairman of the French Republican Youth League

　　Bac Ninh is a small provincial capital in northern Vietnam. In November 1947, this place was occupied by French paratroopers. Last summer, under the pressure of the Vietnamese People's Army, the French army was forced to withdraw completely.
　　In this city, the original houses were made of brick and stone, but they have been completely destroyed. Now, many thatched huts have been rebuilt on the outskirts of the city walls.
　　My companions invited me to climb a small mountain, from which the scenery here can be seen at a glance.
　　A French official who used to live here was indeed a small king of the city. He built a spacious mansion on the small mountain, complete with parks, ponds, sports fields, and all kinds of facilities.
　　Climbing to the top of the mountain, facing the large white gate of the mansion, there was a cross on the gate, with the words "French Military Cemetery" written on it.
　　I took off my hat and followed the guides inside.
　　The graves were arranged on the former tennis court.
　　The Battle of Bac Ninh cost the French army a heavy price. Hundreds of graves were arranged in several rows, marked with various arms of service: paratroopers, infantry, artillery, engineers... but all of them were French. As for African and other foreign soldiers, they are not buried here.
　　Unfortunately, I can't even say a name.
　　In order to make it difficult for others to identify them, the French army cut down all the crosses in front of the graves.
　　This is an indescribable crime. Before fleeing, the French command ordered the numbered crosses to be cut down, making it difficult for the Vietnamese government to identify these poor dead and making it impossible for the families of the dead to know that their children were buried on the small mountain in Bac Ninh.
　　I talked to President Ho Chi Minh about this matter, and he said: The Vietnamese government has ordered the protection of all French military cemeteries, and he guarantees that the dead will be handed over to their families as soon as the war is over.
　　Looking at the graves in front of me with many crosses lying diagonally, I couldn't help but clench my fists. How many good French people, misled by the war propaganda of the French reactionaries, lost their lives tens of thousands of miles away from their homes, for what interests and purposes?
　　I don't know how many soldiers like this were buried anonymously and unverifiably in Bac Ninh.
　　The French rulers are afraid that the French people will know the exact number of officers and soldiers who died in the war in Indochina, and they are also afraid of announcing this shocking number.
　　This is what I saw in the Bac Ninh cemetery.
　　French officers and soldiers should deeply reflect on the crimes of this war.
　　French officers and soldiers who are tired of fighting for the Americans, open your eyes and take a look...
　　The number of French officers and soldiers who revolt and return to the Vietnamese People's Army is constantly increasing. Does this still need proof? Thousands of French, Africans, and people from other countries are waiting to be sent back to their countries, and some have even joined the People's Army, such as the North African Detachment I saw, which is a good example.
　　French prisoners of war have also personally seen the current situation in Vietnam, and they have been treated well. They have jobs to do, and some have even gotten married.
　　They all realize the essence of this crazy and despicable war and hope to end this war as soon as possible.
　　I once read a newsletter written by the First French Prisoner of War Camp in March of this year ("Hope" No. 25), entitled "Soldiers' Opinions on the Vietnam War." I excerpt a few sentences below:
　　"Our current view of Vietnam is completely different from when we were captured. What surprised us first was the preferential treatment of prisoners, followed by the organization of the Vietnamese People's Army and the administration of Vietnam. We were also surprised that the officers and intellectuals here are French - true French - friends. Just looking at it makes it clear that the vast majority of the Vietnamese people and most of the talented people are moving towards this side, inspired by an independent and logical idea." This newsletter was written by Lieutenant Peter Marion.
　　These words powerfully illustrate the mood of the French army and need no further explanation from me.

### 北?的法军墓地

　　北?的法军墓地
    法国共和青年联盟主席  斐盖尔
    北?是越南北部的一个小省会，一九四七年十一月这个地方被法国降落伞部队占领，去年夏天，在越南人民军的压力下，法军才被迫全部撤退。
    在这个城市里，原是砖石砌成的房屋，但已被完全破坏，现在在城垣的四郊重新建起了许多茅屋。
    同伴们邀我登上了一座小山，从山上望下去，这里的景致就一览无遗了。
    从前住在这里的一位法国官员，确是一个城市的小国王，在小山上盖了一所宽敞的大厦，里面有公园、池塘、运动场，一切设备应有尽有。
    攀到山顶，面对着大厦的大白门，门头上立着一个十字架，并写着“法军墓地”几个字。
    我脱下了帽子，随同向导们走进去。
    坟墓排列在从前的网球场上。
    北?战役，法军付出了重大的代价，成百的坟墓排成了好几行，标明各种不同的兵种：伞兵、步兵、炮兵、工兵……但全是法国籍，至于非洲和其他外籍的兵士是不埋在这里的。
    可惜我连一个名字都说不出来。
    为了使别人难于辨认，法军把所有墓前的十字架全部砍毁了。
    这是一种无法形容的罪行，在逃走前法军指挥部下令将这些编有号数的十字架砍毁，使越南政府难以辨认这些可怜的死者，并使死者的家庭无法知道他们的孩子是被埋葬在北?的小山上。
    我曾同胡志明主席谈起这件事，他说：越南政府已下令保护所有的法军墓地，他保证一俟战争结束，死者即交给他们的家庭。
    看着前面斜躺着许多十字架的坟墓，我禁不住握紧了我的拳头。多少善良的法国人民，受了法国反动派战争宣传的迷惑，把生命断送在远离家乡万里的地方，到底是为了什么利益和目的呢？
    像这样不名誉地而且无可查究地被埋葬在北?的士兵们，不知还有多少。
    法国的统治者们惟恐法国人民知道在印度支那作战死亡官兵的确实数字，同时也怕把这个惊人的数字宣布出去。
    这就是我所看见的北?墓地。
    法国的军官和士兵们对于这种战争的罪恶应该深切地反省。
    讨厌为美国人打仗的法军官兵们，睁开眼来看看吧……
    起义归向越南人民军的法军官兵在不断地增加着，这还需要证明吗？成千的法国人、非洲人和其他国家的人，他们在等待着遣送回国，甚至有的已加入了人民军，如我所看见的北非支队就是很好的例子。
    法军俘虏们也亲自看到了越南的现状，他们并且受到了优待。他们有工作做，甚至有的还结了婚。
    他们都认识到这种疯狂的卑污的战争的本质，希望能早日结束这种战争。
    我曾读到第一法军俘虏营在今年三月写的通讯（“希望”第二十五期），题目是“士兵们对越南战争的意见”，我摘录几句写在下面：
    “我们现在对越南的看法与被俘时完全不同了。首先使我们惊讶的是对俘虏的优待，其次是越南人民军的组织和越南的行政。我们还感到奇怪的是，这里的军官和知识分子都是法国的——真正的法国——友人，只要看一看就能明白，绝大多数的越南人民和大部分有才干的人们都走向这一面，被一个争取独立、很合逻辑的思想所鼓舞着。”这篇通讯是彼得·马里昂中尉写的。
    这段话有力的说明了法军的心情，不需我再解释了。
