　　We Will Always Stand at the Forefront of National Defense! Forever a Vital Force in Defending Peace!
    Hua Dong Military Region, Third Field Army Combat Hero Zhang Ming

    Last year, just as we were launching an attack on the outer islands of Zhoushan, I saw in the newspaper the news, in large red characters, that Chairman Mao had been elected Chairman of the Central People's Government and that Chairman Mao had formally announced the "Establishment of the People's Republic of China." At that moment, I jumped up with joy, and all the comrades in the room applauded and cheered vigorously. Chairman Mao said, "The Chinese people have stood up!" How moving these words are! The day we had hoped for for generations had finally arrived! Immediately, the news spread among the troops on the coast, the sailors, and the civilian laborers supporting the front, and they shouted loudly: "Let us celebrate the founding of our People's Republic with the victory of our cross-sea battle!" In this way, we braved the rain to land on Jintang Island and annihilated the enemy.

    Over the past year, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, our People's Liberation Army has liberated coastal islands and reached the frontiers of the motherland, and is now working hard to liberate Tibet and Taiwan. Over the past year, we have also seen that our country's production and construction are progressing rapidly under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Now, on the occasion of the National Day anniversary, I have been selected as a representative of combat heroes to come to the capital to gather and exchange experiences. Here, we saw our wise leader Chairman Mao and our Commander-in-Chief Zhu, which is truly the greatest honor of my life!

    Just as we are happy and cheering for the victory of our motherland, the imperialists and reactionaries are jealous. The American imperialists launched a war of aggression against Korea, and further invaded our motherland's territory of Taiwan, and repeatedly bombed Northeast China. This series of facts shows that the American imperialist warmongers are planning to expand the war, undermine peace, and seize the victory we have won with blood and sweat. Here, we want to warn the American imperialists and warmongers: the Chinese people defeated Japanese imperialism, and also defeated Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog equipped by American imperialism. The Chinese people have stood up! The Chinese people have a strong national defense army, and the Chinese people are not to be trifled with! You should also look in the mirror and see that your paper tiger, which looks strong but is weak, has already been exposed by the People's Army in Korea. If you dare to risk attacking our motherland, we will make sure you have a way in but no way out, and annihilate all of you bandits on our territory! We will resolutely defend our motherland! We will never allow any imperialists to invade an inch of our land! Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will always stand at the forefront of national defense, and will always be a vital force in defending world peace!

### 我们永远站在国防最前线！永远是保卫和平的生力军！

　　我们永远站在国防最前线！永远是保卫和平的生力军！
    华东军区、三野战斗英雄  张明
    去年正当我们向舟山外围岛屿发动攻击时，在报纸上我看到了毛主席当选为中央人民政府主席和毛主席正式宣布“中华人民共和国成立”的大红字的消息，当时我高兴得跳起来了，屋里所有的同志也都用力地鼓掌欢呼。毛主席讲：“中国人民站起来了！”这话是多么动人啊！我们祖祖辈辈所盼望的一天终于实现了！立时，这消息便在海滨的部队、水手和支前的民工们中间传遍，他们响亮高呼：“以我们渡海战斗的胜利，来庆祝我们人民共和国的成立！”就这样，我们冒雨打上了金塘岛，歼灭了敌人。
    一年来，我们解放军在毛主席朱总司令的领导下，解放了沿海岛屿，打到了祖国的边疆，现在也正在为解放西藏、台湾而努力着。一年来我们也看到了我们国家的生产建设，在毛主席的领导下飞快地进展着。现在正当国庆纪念节之际，我被选为战斗英雄的代表，来到首都集会交流经验，在这里，我们看到了我们英明的领袖毛主席和我们的朱总司令，这真是我一生来最大的荣幸！
    正当我们为自己的祖国的胜利而高兴、而欢呼时，帝国主义者和反动派却在眼红，美帝国主义者发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，又进一步侵略我们祖国的领土台湾并数次空袭东北，这一连串的事实，说明美帝国主义者战争贩子们，是在有计划地扩大战争，破坏和平，夺取我们用血汗换来的胜利。在这里我们要警告美帝国主义者和战争贩子们：中国人民打败了日本帝国主义，又打败了美帝国主义者装备的走狗蒋介石，中国人民已经站立起来了！中国人民有强大的国防军，中国人民不是好惹的！你们也照照镜子，看看你们这个外强中干的纸老虎，在朝鲜已经被人民军戳穿了。假若你们要冒险向我们的祖国进攻，我们将叫你们有来路没去路，把你们这些匪徒们全部歼灭在我们的国土上！我们坚决保卫我们的祖国！我们决不允许任何帝国主义者侵犯我们一寸土地！在毛主席的领导下，我们将永远站在国防的最前线，也永远是一支保卫世界和平的生力军！
