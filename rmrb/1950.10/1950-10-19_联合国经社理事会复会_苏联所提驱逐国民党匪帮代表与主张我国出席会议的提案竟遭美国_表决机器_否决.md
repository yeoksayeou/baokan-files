Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: A summary of TASS reports: The 11th session of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, which began in Geneva in July and August of this year, resumed in New York on October 12. The Chairman of the Economic and Social Council, Chilean representative Santa Cruz, proposed the agenda at the opening, including the so-called aid plan for the reconstruction of Korea, a long-term program to accelerate Korea's economic development and social progress, and the date and location of the next session of the Economic and Social Council.

The Soviet representative, Yaroujian, spoke on the procedural matters. He pointed out that the presence of the Kuomintang representative at the meeting was illegal, and proposed to expel the Kuomintang representative and allow the representative of the People's Republic of China to attend the meeting. The Soviet proposal was supported by representatives from Czechoslovakia, Poland, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan and other countries. Czechoslovak representative Pol said: The Economic and Social Council must allow the representative of the 500 million Chinese people to attend the meeting. Polish representative Katz-Suchy pointed out that the inability of the People's Republic of China to participate in the United Nations hinders the effective activities of various UN agencies. However, American lackeys directed representatives of several countries to unreasonably oppose the Soviet proposal. The first part of the Soviet proposal, which advocated the expulsion of the Kuomintang representative, was rejected by eleven votes to seven. The Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, India, Pakistan, the United Kingdom and Denmark voted in favor, while the United States, Canada, Australia, France, the Kuomintang, Peru, Belgium, Brazil, Iran, Mexico and Chile voted against. The second part of the Soviet proposal, which advocated allowing the representative of the People's Republic of China to participate in the meeting, was rejected by eleven votes to six. The only difference from the vote on the first part was that Denmark abstained. After the Soviet proposal was rejected, the Soviet representative, Yaroujian, immediately stated: The Soviet delegation believes that the Council's decision is incorrect and illegal. Polish representative Suchy also supported the Soviet statement.

The meeting on the 12th adopted the agenda proposed by the Chairman.

A meeting was also held on October 16 to discuss the Australian proposal, which recommended appointing a seven-nation temporary committee to study possible needs in terms of aid and reconstruction in Korea and to submit a report to the Security Council as soon as possible. The Soviet representative, Yaroujian, proposed at the meeting an amendment to invite representatives from North Korea and South Korea to participate in the work of the committee, pointing out that the Korean people know better than anyone else what they need. The Soviet amendment was rejected by the American and British voting machine. The meeting passed the Australian proposal, and representatives from the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia abstained.

　　联合国经社理事会复会
    苏联所提驱逐国民党匪帮代表与主张我国出席会议的提案竟遭美国“表决机器”否决
    【新华社十八日讯】综合塔斯社讯：曾于今年七、八月间在日内瓦开始举行的联合国经社理事会第十一届会议，于十月十二日起在纽约复会。经社理事会主席智利代表圣大克鲁兹在开会时提出会议议程，包括所谓援助朝鲜复兴计划，加速朝鲜经济发展及社会进步的长期方案，以及经社理事会召开下一届会议的日期与地点诸议案。
    苏联代表亚鲁疆就议事程序发言，他指出国民党代表出席会议是非法的，并提出驱逐国民党代表及准许中华人民共和国代表出席会议的提案。苏联提案受到捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、英国、印度、巴基斯坦等国代表的支持。捷克斯洛伐克代表波尔称：经社理事会必须准许五亿中国人民的代表出席会议。波兰代表卡兹·苏琪指出：中华人民共和国代表不能参加联合国，就阻碍了联合国各机构的有效活动。但是美国仆从指挥其若干国家代表无理反对苏联提案。苏联提案中主张驱逐国民党代表的第一部分，以十一票对七票被否决。苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、印度、巴基斯坦、英国和丹麦投票赞成，美国、加拿大、澳大利亚、法国、国民党、秘鲁、比利时、巴西、伊朗、墨西哥及智利投票反对。苏联提案中主张准许中华人民共和国代表参加会议的第二部分，以十一票对六票被否决，惟与第一部分表决时不同的是丹麦弃权。在苏联提案被否决后，苏联代表亚鲁疆当即声明：苏联代表团认为理事会的决定是不正确的与非法的。波兰代表苏琪也支持苏联的声明。
    十二日的会议通过了主席所提出的会议议程。
    十月十六日又举行会议，讨论澳大利亚的提案，它建议指定一个七国临时委员会研究朝鲜在援助与复兴方面可能的需要，并尽速向安理会提出报告。苏联代表亚鲁疆在会上提出邀请北朝鲜与南朝鲜代表参加委员会工作的修正案，他指出朝鲜人民较之任何其他人都更知道他们需要什么。苏联的修正案竟为美英表决机器所否决。会议通过了澳大利亚提案，苏联、波兰、与捷克斯洛伐克代表弃权。
