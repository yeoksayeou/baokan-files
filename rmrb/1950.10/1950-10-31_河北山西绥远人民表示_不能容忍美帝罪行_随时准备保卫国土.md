Li Xijiu, Deputy Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, called on the people of the entire province to unite, heighten vigilance, and prepare to shatter the U.S. imperialist aggression plot.

Huang Youfu, an industrial labor model attending the National Model Workers Representative Conference, called on fellow workers to improve production, increase economic strength, and oppose U.S. imperialist aggression. The entire student body of the First Middle School sent a telegram to Chairman Mao saying, "In order to oppose the American aggressors, wherever the country needs us, we will go." The Shanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and other people's organizations jointly issued a protest stating: If U.S. imperialism dares to extend its claws of aggression one step into Chinese territory, the eleven million people of Shanxi Province will resolutely contribute everything, together with the people of the whole country, to defend the motherland. Dong Qiwu, Chairman of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government, and Sun Lanfeng, Deputy Commander of the Military Region, both called on the military and civilians of the entire province to work hard in production, actively train cadres, and be ready at any time to contribute their greatest strength to defend the homeland.
