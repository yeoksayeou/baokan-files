Xinhua News Agency, October 18th: Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai sent a telegram to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie on the 18th, and forwarded it to UN Fifth General Assembly President Nasrollah Entezam and Security Council President Austin, to strongly protest the US military aircraft invading North Korea repeatedly intruding into our country's airspace on the 13th and 14th. He once again filed a complaint with the United Nations, demanding that the Security Council take effective measures to stop the US invading North Korea from expanding its aggressive behavior, and immediately withdraw US troops from Korea to prevent the situation from escalating. The text of the telegram is as follows: Mr. Trygve Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations at Lake Success, New York, and forwarded to Mr. Nasrollah Entezam, President of the Fifth General Assembly of the United Nations, and Mr. Austin, President of the Security Council:

　　According to a report from our Northeast People's Government, at 15:07 Beijing time on October 13, two US military aircraft invading North Korea intruded into Yanjiang Village, Changbai County, Liaodong Province, and flew to Yanjiang Village again at 15:08. At 20:00 on October 14, another aircraft of the US military invading North Korea intruded into Shanghuolonggai Village, Ji'an County, Liaodong Province. At 20:45 on October 14, another aircraft of the US military invading North Korea intruded into Ji'an County, Liaodong Province from North Korea, and the aircraft intruded into our airspace for about 30 li.

　　The provocative act of the US military aircraft invading North Korea repeatedly intruding into China's airspace for reconnaissance on October 13 and 14 shows that the United States is actively expanding the war of aggression against Korea. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. I, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, lodge a serious protest against the atrocities of the US military aircraft invading North Korea intruding into our country's airspace, and once again file a complaint and request to the United Nations. The United Nations Security Council should immediately take effective measures to stop the US troops invading North Korea from expanding their aggression, and immediately withdraw US troops from Korea to prevent the situation from escalating.

    再次要求安理会制止美国扩大侵略行为并立即撤退美国侵朝军队以免事态扩大
    【新华社十八日讯】外交部周恩来部长于十八日致电联合国秘书长赖伊，并转联合国第五届大会主席安迪让及安全理事会主席奥斯汀，严重抗议美侵朝军用机于十三，十四两日多次侵入我国领空，并再度向联合国提出控诉，要求安全理事会采取有效措施，制止美国侵朝军队扩大侵略的行为，并立即撤退美国侵朝军队，以免事态扩大。电文如下：纽约成功湖联合国秘书长赖伊先生，并转联合国第五届大会主席安迪让先生及安全理事会主席奥斯汀先生：
    据我东北人民政府报告，十月十三日北京时间十五时七分，有美国侵略朝鲜军队军用飞机二架侵入我辽东省长白县之沿江村，十五时八分，再飞至我沿江村。十月十四日二十时零分又有侵朝美军的飞机一架侵入我辽东省辑安县上活龙盖村。十月十四日二十时四十五分，又有侵朝美军的飞机一架，自朝鲜侵入我辽东省辑安县，该机侵入我领空约三十华里。
    美国侵略朝鲜军队的军用飞机十月十三、十四两日多次侵入中国领空、进行侦察的挑衅行为，说明美国正在积极扩大侵朝战争。这是中国人民所决不能容忍的。我代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府对美国侵略朝鲜军队军用飞机侵入我国领空的暴行，提出严重抗议，并再一次向联合国提出控诉和要求，联合国安全理事会应立即采取有效措施，制止美国侵朝军队扩大侵略的行为，并立即撤退美国侵朝军队，以免事态扩大。
          中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长  周恩来
          一九五○年十月十八日于北京
