Xinhua News Agency, 27th. To aid the French colonial army, which suffered a disastrous defeat in northern Vietnam, the US imperialists are rushing large quantities of armaments to Vietnam. According to a United Press Washington dispatch: The United States has handed over eight transport planes, twenty-four landing craft, and a large amount of jungle warfare equipment to the French army invading Vietnam. According to Agence France-Presse: in mid-October, five US Navy ships carrying arms rushed from the west coast of the United States to Vietnam. The French aircraft carrier "Dixmude," which went to San Francisco in September to load aircraft, will also arrive at Saigon port at the end of October, carrying forty American-supplied fighter planes.

However, this aid from the US imperialists has failed to reassure the French colonial authorities. United Press stated that the French High Commissioner for Indochina, Pignon, announced on the 21st that the entire French-occupied area of the Tonkin region (i.e., North Vietnam) was under "martial law." According to Agence France-Presse, Indochina stocks on the Paris stock market, after a general decline on October 10th and 11th, once again experienced a "general decline" on the 25th.

　　援助侵越惨败法军  美国军火赶运越南
    这些援助并未能使法殖民当局安心
    北越法占领区已宣布处于戒严状态
    【新华社二十七日讯】美帝国主义者为援助在越南北部遭受惨败的法国殖民军，刻正赶运大量军火前往越南。据合众社华盛顿消息：美国已将运输机八架、登陆艇二十四艘、及大量的森林作战装备交给侵略越南的法军。据法新社消息：本月中旬有五艘载有军火的美海军船只，从美国西海岸赶赴越南。九月间前往旧金山装载飞机的法国航空母舰“狄克斯姆德”号，亦将于十月底抵达西贡港口，载有美国供应的战斗机四十架。
    但是，美帝国主义的这些援助，并未能使法国的殖民当局安心。合众社称，法国驻印度支那高级专员皮农已于二十一日宣布整个东京区（即北越）的法国占领区，处于“戒严状态”另据法新社消息，巴黎证券市场的印度支那股票，继十月十日、十一日的全面下跌后，又于二十五日再次“全面下跌”。
