(Shenyang News) According to the Northeast Daily, the industrial departments of Liaodong, Liaoxi, Jilin, and Songjiang provinces have all focused on examining the economic accounting ideology in operational management during this rectification movement. It was discovered that due to the "supply system thinking" existing in the leadership of the industrial departments, a large amount of product and raw material stockpiling occurred in various factories and mines. For example, the Liaodong Provincial Industrial Department once stipulated that all products produced by factories and mines should be handed over to the industrial department, and the supply and marketing department would be responsible for unified sales. Factories and mines would request materials and cash from the industrial department. As a result, the factories and mines developed a sense of dependence, only asking for money and not caring about how the products were sold. At the third industrial and mining conference of the Liaoxi Provincial Industrial Department, it was only verbally conveyed that fixed assets should be strictly distinguished from circulating funds, but a clear system was never specified and implemented in various factories and mines. Coupled with insufficient on-site inspections, the phenomenon of fund stockpiling was never properly resolved. Due to the stockpiling of funds, not only is the expansion of reproduction directly affected, but also basic construction investments cannot be resolved. Currently, many factories and mines in Jilin and Liaodong rely on bank loans to maintain production and construction.

Formulating production plans without properly considering market needs (national orders and market sales) is the second reason for the stockpiling of products in various factories and mines. The crude oil produced by the Yuhadian Oil Shale Mine in Jilin Province is only needed by the Jiangnan Chemical Plant in Jilin, and there is a certain limit. However, the mine did not consider this objective situation and blindly invested in adding oil refining furnaces to expand production. As a result, the crude oil produced could not be used by the chemical plant, resulting in a stockpile of more than 600,000 kilograms. The Songjiang Provincial Firewood Factory also stockpiled more than 8,000 boxes of firewood in half a year, resulting in stagnant funds of more than 10 billion yuan, because the plan did not consider sales channels. What is even more noteworthy is that the production tasks stipulated by some industrial departments in the past only had quantity requirements without quality requirements, or although there were quality requirements, the factories and mines did not follow the rules, resulting in poor product quality, affecting sales. For example, the wine produced by the Tonghua Winery stockpiled more than 11,700 boxes, worth 17.9 billion yuan, because of poor quality. Liaoxi Egg Company also has a lot of egg yolk that cannot be sold due to substandard quality, resulting in a stockpile of funds of more than 23 billion yuan. In addition, high costs and transfer prices are also one of the direct causes of product stockpiling. For example, the MSG of Liaodong Guanghua Brewing Factory stockpiled more than 4,600 kilograms for this reason. The stockpiling of raw materials in various factories and mines is mainly due to not calculating the capital turnover period, not striving to shorten the raw material reserve period, and not scientifically stipulating the raw material reserve amount. Therefore, they are only afraid of work stoppages and material shortages, and purchase or store a large amount of raw materials regardless of current needs. For example, the Liaoxi No. 1 Machinery Factory was afraid of rising prices and that materials would be difficult to buy in the future, so it purchased materials regardless of whether they were currently needed or usable, resulting in the stockpiling of funds.

After checking out these problems, the industrial departments of various provinces have held special meetings to study ways to overcome them, decided to change the past supply system management method, implement a factory and mine supply and marketing system, determine the cost reduction tasks of various factories and mines, and hand in profits on a monthly basis; determine the storage time of raw materials, the stockpiling time of reserves and finished products, and the capital turnover period, etc., in order to establish the cost concept of factories and mines and implement the economic accounting system. In order to overcome the disconnection between production and actual needs, Liaodong Province has revised the blind parts of the original production plan and re-formulated the production plan based on market needs, capital conditions, and technical equipment. In addition, all localities have decided to launch a movement to improve quality and reduce costs, and send people to sign sales contracts with state-owned trade agencies to open up market sales channels.

### 辽东等四省工业厅检查工矿经营管理  纠正严重积压资金现象

　　辽东等四省工业厅检查工矿经营管理
    纠正严重积压资金现象
    【沈阳讯】据东北日报消息：辽东、辽西、吉林、松江等四省工业厅，在这次整风中均着重检查经营管理工作中的经济核算思想。发现由于工业厅领导上存在着“供给制思想”，致造成各厂矿大量产品与原材料的积压，如辽东省工业厅曾规定：厂矿生产出来的产品全部交工业厅，由供销处统一推销，厂矿需要材料和现款就向工业厅要。因而给各厂矿养成依赖思想，只伸手要钱，产品销路如何则全不管。辽西省工业厅第三次工矿会议上只口头传达了固定资金要与流动资金严格区分，但始终没有规定一种明确的制度贯彻到各厂矿，加之实地检查不够，致使资金积压现象，始终未能很好解决。由于资金的积压，不仅直接影响扩大再生产，而且使基本建设投资无法解决，现吉林、辽东有许多厂矿是依靠银行贷款来维持生产和修建的。
    制订生产计划时，没有很好考虑市场需要（国家定货和市场销售），则是造成各厂矿产品积压的第二个原因。吉林省营桦甸油母页岩矿生产的原油，只有吉林江南化学厂需用，并有一定限度，但该矿并未考虑这一客观情况，盲目投资增设炼油炉扩大生产，结果生产出来的原油化学厂用不了，积压六十余万公斤。松江省营火柴厂亦因订计划没考虑销路，半年中积压火柴八千余箱，呆滞资金一百余亿元。更值得提出的，是有的工业厅过去规定的生产任务，只有数量，没有质量要求，或虽然有了质量要求，但各厂矿没有按章办事，以致产品质量低劣，影响了销路。如通化葡萄酒厂出的酒，即因质量不好，积压了一万一千七百余箱，价值一百七十九亿元。辽西蛋业公司亦有许多蛋黄，因不合格找不到销路，积压资金二百三十余亿元。此外，成本和拨价高，也是直接造成产品积压原因之一。如辽东光华酿造厂的味素，积压了四千六百余斤，原因即在于此。各厂矿积压原材料，主要是由于不计算资金周转期，不力求缩短原材料储备期和科学的规定原材料储备量，因而只怕停工待料，大量购入或储存原材料所致。如辽西第一机械厂怕物价上涨，怕以后材料不好买，便不管当前需要与否，遇到材料就采购，结果买了许多当前用不着和用不了的材料，积压了资金。
    各省工业厅检查出这些问题后，都专门召开会议研究克服办法，决定改变过去供给制的经营方法，实行厂矿供销制度，确定各厂矿降低成本任务，按月上缴利润；确定原材料储存时间、储备品和成品的积压时间，以及资金周转期间等，以树立厂矿成本观念，贯彻经济核算制。辽东省为了克服生产与实际需要脱节现象，已修正了原来生产计划的盲目部分，根据市场需要、资金情况和技术设备等原则，重新制订了生产计划。此外，各地都决定要开展提高质量、降低成本运动，并派人与国家贸易机关订推销合同，打开市场销路。
