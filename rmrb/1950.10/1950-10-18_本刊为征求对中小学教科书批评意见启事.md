　　Notice of Solicitation of Opinions on Criticisms of Primary and Secondary School Textbooks

　　At the beginning of this autumn semester, the Publication Administration Bureau and other publishers edited and printed many new textbooks for use in primary and secondary schools nationwide. These textbooks were mostly compiled collectively. Among them, the textbooks edited by the Publication Administration Bureau's Editorial and Review Department, in the process of editing, some were provided with opinions by several experts and many middle school teachers in Beijing. These textbooks may have some improvements compared to the past, but they may not be perfect. We would like to solicit criticisms and discussions of these newly compiled textbooks from teachers and other educators in various regions as a basis for future improvements. If teachers feel that there are unsuitable aspects or other opinions during actual teaching, we especially hope that they will write to us in a specific and detailed manner. We will publish these types of articles as much as possible.

　　本刊为征求对中小学教科书批评意见启事
    本年秋季开学，出版总署编审局和其他出版家编辑了许多册新课本，印行供全国中小学应用。这些课本多半是用集体的方式编成的。其中出版总署编审局编辑的课本，在编辑过程中，一部分曾经由几位专家和北京市的好多位中学教师提供了意见。这些课本比过去可能有若干改进，但不一定就能十分完善，我们想征求各地教师及其他教育工作者对这些新编课本的批评和讨论，作为以后改进的依据。教师们在实际教学的时候，如果感觉有不适合的地方或其他意见，尤其希望能具体而详尽地写寄给我们。对于这类文章，我们当尽可能予以发表。
