　　Shandong Department Store Focuses on Inspection Work
    Finds Serious Blindness in Operations

    [Our Newspaper News] According to the *Dazhong Daily*, the Shandong Provincial Department Store is actively carrying out rectification and has now entered the stage of focused inspection. After more than a month of studying documents, the company has begun to correct the phenomenon of some comrades only focusing on the details of life, while neglecting important issues related to policies, guidelines, and business operations in their work. Since its establishment, the company has achieved certain results in its various tasks under the leadership of the Party committee, the government, and higher-level companies. However, in the preliminary summary of the rectification made by the company's leaders, the following shortcomings and errors have been found in terms of business policy and price control: (1) Blind procurement without regard to actual needs, transplanting the practices of large cities to small and medium-sized cities. For example, high-end goods, raincoats, umbrellas, children's clothing, and high-quality shirts purchased in Shanghai were all overstocked in warehouses and could not be sold. This shows that in the business line, the policy of serving the broad masses was not firmly grasped, and there was a tendency to become detached from the masses. (2) In terms of price control, the prices of individual industrial products in small cities were lower than those in large cities in August. For example, toothpaste and rubber shoes flowed back to Jinan from Zhoucun, Tai'an, and Dezhou due to excessively low prices. Some branches sold bleaching powder for only 250,000 yuan per barrel; merchants resold it in Qingdao for 1.2 million yuan per barrel. This unreasonable phenomenon was mainly due to the provincial company's failure to pay attention to control. (3) There was blindness in planning and business. Plans were often made to make up the numbers, rather than to guide the work. For example, the monthly recovery of currency in April, May, and June did not exceed 40 billion yuan; however, in July, 60 billion yuan was planned to make up the numbers, resulting in only 40 billion yuan being completed. The procurement funds in May could not be used up, so 20,000 reams of paper were bought, so much so that the current inventory is estimated to not be used up by the end of the year. For example, the warehouse already had 10,000 dozens of Xianglan toothpaste in stock, but the plan still called for buying Xianglan toothpaste. All of the above have greatly affected the turnover of funds. (4) Poor management led to serious losses of state assets. For example, the fertilizer transported from Nanjing to Jinan was then transported to Tai'an, Xuzhou, and other places, resulting in a waste of more than 20 million yuan in freight. Two thousand bolts of longxu cloth were transported from Jinan to Tai'an, but it was reported that they could not be sold, so they were transferred back from Tai'an to Jinan. Later, it was said that they could be sold again, so they were transported from Jinan to Tai'an for the second time, resulting in the "traveling" of goods. Similar situations occurred repeatedly. In addition, due to the lack of progress, corruption, and lack of responsibility of individual cadres, the total losses of state assets due to embezzlement, fire, mold, theft, shortage of goods, shortage of funds, and incorrect payments totaled more than 128.8 million yuan, according to incomplete statistics.

    The causes of the above errors are due to the bureaucratic style of leadership, the failure to properly study the instructions and documents of the higher authorities, often copying and forwarding them, or handling them hastily; the instructions to the lower levels were not specific, and there was a lack of policy education, resulting in the lower-level companies having a task-oriented view when carrying out their work; and there were disconnections such as the failure to communicate the situation from above to below, and the failure to communicate the situation from below to above. The leaders of the company reported the shortcomings that had been initially exposed, and asked everyone to continue to expose shortcomings, help the leadership analyze the situation, find the crux of the problem, and formulate improvement measures in order to improve the leadership style and further improve the work.

### 山东百货公司重点检查工作  发现经营上有严重盲目性

　　山东百货公司重点检查工作
    发现经营上有严重盲目性
    【本报讯】据大众日报讯：山东省百货公司积极整风，现已进入重点检查工作阶段。该公司经过一个多月的文件学习，已开始纠正一般同志只注重生活细节，而忽视了工作中有关政策方针及业务经营上的重大问题的现象。该公司成立以来，在党委和政府及上级公司领导下，各项工作均有一定的成绩。但在该公司领导者所作的整风初步总结中，已发现在经营方针及物价掌握等方面，曾产生以下缺点和错误：（一）不根据实际需要盲目采购，把大城市的一套搬到中小城市。如在上海采购的高贵货物、雨衣、旱伞、童衣及上好衬衫等，均积压在仓库不能销售。这说明在经营路线上，未能紧紧掌握面向广大群众的方针，而有脱离群众的毛病。（二）在物价掌握上，八月份个别工业品价格，小城市低于大城市。如牙膏、胶鞋，因周村、泰安、德州价格过低，而向济南倒流。有的分公司出售漂白粉，每桶只售二十五万元；商人贩到青岛出售，每桶售价一百二十万元；这种不合理的现象，主要是省公司未注意掌握所致。（三）计划上和业务上存在着盲目性，计划多是为了凑够数字，而不是从指导工作着眼。如四、五、六月份每月回笼货币最多不超过四百亿；而七月份为了凑上数字，却计划了六百亿，结果只完成四百余亿。五月份的采购款用不了，即买了二万令纸，以致现在存货，估计年底也用不完。又如仓库本已存有一万余打香兰牙膏，造计划还买香兰牙膏。以上这些，大大影响了资金周转。（四）经营管理不善，致使国家资财受到严重损失。如从南京运来济南的肥田粉，又运往泰安、徐州等地，致浪费运费人民币二千余万元。由济南运往泰安的龙须布二千匹，据反映说卖不出去，由泰安又调回济南，后来听说又可以出售，又由济南二次运往泰安，造成物资旅行。类此情况，迭有发生。其他由于个别干部不求进步、堕落腐化和责任心不强而造成的国家资财损失，据不完全统计，贪污、失火、霉烂、盗劫、短货、短款及错款等总计损失达一亿二千八百余万元。
    造成以上错误的原因，是由于领导作风上的官僚主义，没能很好研究上级指示文件，多是照抄照转，或草率处理；对下级指示不具体，缺乏政策教育，以致造成下级公司在进行工作时的任务观点；还有上情不能下达，下情不能上达等脱节现象。该公司领导者报告了初步揭发出的缺点，要求大家继续揭发缺点，帮助领导上分析情况，找出症结定出改进办法，以改进领导作风，进一步改进工作。
