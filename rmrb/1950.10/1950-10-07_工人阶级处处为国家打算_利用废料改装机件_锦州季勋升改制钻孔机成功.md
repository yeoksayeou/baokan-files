　　The Working Class Considers the Nation's Needs Everywhere
    Using Waste Materials to Modify Machine Parts
    Jinzhou's Ji Xunsheng Successfully Converts Drilling Machine
    [This newspaper, Jinzhou News] Ji Xunsheng, a foreman at the Jinzhou Railway Bureau's Engineering Works Machinery Factory, converted a waste stratum drilling machine into a steel plate drilling machine, reducing working hours by four times. In the third and fourth quarters of this year, the factory's task of repairing steel beams was extremely heavy. In order to improve work efficiency and complete the production task, foreman Ji Xunsheng found an oil drilling machine that had been left unused for several years in the scrap iron pile of the Jinzhou Engineering Section. The pulley, oil storage device, and many other parts of this machine were incomplete. He first scrubbed off the rust, looked around for parts that could be assembled, installed unused pulleys, installed an electric roller, converted the two-inch pipe tapping into a tapping that could hold drill bits of various sizes, and precisely adjusted the number of revolutions of the pulley. He installed a grinding wheel on the pulley shaft, installed four small wheels under the machine, and finally painted it all over. After five days of hard work, he finally completed a brand-new drilling machine on September 20. Ordinary hand-held electric drills and drilling machines with drill stands take 40 seconds to drill a hole, while the drilling machine he converted only takes 8 seconds; hand-held electric drills are prone to overheating due to long working hours of the wire package, and must be used for one hour and cooled for half an hour, while this new drilling machine can continue non-stop. In addition, the four small wheels make it easy to move, light and convenient, and the attached grinding wheel also makes it easy to repair drill bits, saving a power source. Due to Ji Xunsheng's creation, not only were working hours saved fourfold and work efficiency improved, but also wealth was increased for the country.

    [This newspaper reports] Wang Chaoen, Zhang Zhaoming, Li Baozhu and other three machine operators of the Shangqiu Telecommunications Bureau in Zhuji City, Henan Province, used waste telephone parts in September to assemble 23 single telephone sets, one 50-line magneto switchboard, and one Siemens 10-line switchboard, saving the country 20,000 catties of wheat. The administration originally planned to complete 15 single telephone sets and one switchboard by September 20. Thanks to the efforts of Wang Chaoen and others, the task was exceeded in only ten days, which strongly promoted the production campaign of the Shangqiu Telecommunications Bureau.

　　工人阶级处处为国家打算
    利用废料改装机件
    锦州季勋升改制钻孔机成功
    【本报锦州讯】锦州铁路局工务处机械工厂工长季勋升，利用废钻探地层机改造成钢板钻孔机，工时缩短四倍。本年第三、四季度该厂修理钢梁任务非常繁重，工长季勋升为提高工作效率，完成生产任务，在锦州工务段废铁堆里找出一部搁置数年的火油钻探地层机，这个机器的皮带轮，盛油装置及其他许多零件已残缺不全。他首先把锈洗刷干净，各处寻找可以装配的零件，把不用的皮带轮按上，装按了一个电滚，把二寸管掏口改成能按各种尺寸钻头的掏口，精密调整好皮带轮的回转数，在皮带轮轴上，按上一个沙轮，在机器下面按上四个小轮，最后全部涂上油漆，经过五天的埋头工作，终在九月二十日完成一架崭新的钻孔机。普通手持电钻和钻孔座机钻孔用四十秒钟，他改造的钻孔机只用八秒；手持电钻因线包工作时间长容易发热，必须做一点钟，放凉半点钟，这个新钻孔机却可以继续不停；加之按上了四个小轮，可以随意移动，轻巧方便，同时附带按的砂轮，亦便于修理钻头，也省了一个动力。由于季勋升的创造，不但节省工时四倍，提高工作效率，也给国家增加了财富。

    【本报讯】河南朱集市商邱电信局机房机务员王朝恩、张肇明、李宝珠等三人，在九月份利用废电话机零件，配成了单机二十三部，五十门磁石交换机一部，西门子十门总机一部，为国家节省小麦二万斤。行政上原计划在九月二十日前完成单机十五部和总机一部，由于王朝恩等的努力，仅十天内就超过完成任务，对商邱电信局的生产运动起了有力的推动作用。
