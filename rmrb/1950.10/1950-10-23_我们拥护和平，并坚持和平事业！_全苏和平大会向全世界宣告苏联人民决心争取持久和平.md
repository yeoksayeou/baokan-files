(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th) TASS Moscow, October 19th telegram: The Second All-Soviet Peace Conference concluded on the 18th in Moscow. The conference adopted the following letter of mandate to the Soviet delegates attending the Second World Peace Congress:

We—representatives of Soviet workers, peasants, and intellectuals from all over the country participating in the Second All-Soviet Peace Conference, express our willingness to unite sincerely and act in unison with all fighters under the banner of the Second World Peace Congress who are striving for world peace. More than 115.5 million people in the Soviet Union, that is, all adult citizens of the Soviet Union, have signed the Peace Declaration, demonstrating the unwavering will of our people to strive for peace. The Soviet people have made tremendous efforts in the post-war reconstruction and are now striving to realize the great plans for further development of industry and agriculture, the construction of huge hydroelectric power stations, and the reclamation of barren land. They have a vital stake in international security.

All nationalities in our country unanimously approve and support the Stalinist peace policy pursued by the government. Our government's proposal to the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly to consider the "Declaration on Preventing the Threat of a New War and Consolidating World Peace and Security" once again proves our firm desire for peaceful cooperation with all countries in the current tense international situation.

"We uphold peace and persist in the cause of peace!"—this sentence of our great leader Comrade Stalin has become the primary creed of our socialist country—a peace-loving country. Incitement to aggression cannot be found here, nor is it possible to find it. Millions of Soviet people condemn with contempt the criminal acts of those imperialist warmongers and instigators of war, who are poisoning the international atmosphere with their insane barking to destroy mankind, spreading hatred among countries, and constantly intensifying the frenzied arms race.

The imperialist aggressors are implementing their plans to dominate the world, launching a brutal war against the peace-loving Korean people, occupying China's island of Taiwan, suppressing the people in Vietnam, Malaya, Indonesia, and other places who are rising up to fight for freedom, and also arming the former Hitler elements in West Germany, turning Japan into a military base.

In this situation, peace-loving people in all countries must expand and strengthen their activities to defend peace, unite their ranks more closely, and continue to strive for millions of people—all those who love peace, freedom, and civilization, regardless of political belief and religious faith—to fight for peace. The threat posed to the people of all countries by imperialist warmongers is equal. Therefore, defending peace concerns the people of all countries.

The Second All-Soviet Peace Conference, reflecting the will of all the Soviet people, fully supports the decision of the Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress in Prague and entrusts the Soviet delegates participating in the Second World Peace Congress to:

1. Declare to the world that the entire Soviet people are consistently committed to the cause of peace and are willing to fight resolutely and bravely alongside peace fighters from all countries in the world to eliminate the threat of war and strive for a consolidated and lasting peace.

2. Declare to the world that the Soviet people steadfastly demand the prohibition of atomic weapons as a tool of aggression and mass slaughter of people, and demand that any government that first uses such weapons be declared a war criminal.

3. Declare to the world that we, together with all peace fighters, demand the reduction of all kinds of armaments and the establishment of effective controls to achieve the prohibition of atomic weapons and the reduction of armaments.

4. Demand severe condemnation of armed aggression and interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Express to the conference the Soviet people's angry protest against the United States' armed aggression against Korea and the barbaric bombing of peaceful residents in Korea by American aircraft, and call on all good people in the world to demand an immediate end to the Korean War and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea.

5. Demand a strict ban on propaganda for a new war and condemn those engaged in such propaganda. Suggest to the conference that a list of war profiteers be compiled so that all people in the world will know these worst criminals and enemies of progressive humanity.

We, the representatives participating in the Second All-Soviet Peace Conference, call on all peace advocates to continue to expand and unite their ranks. We call on them to work together with strong and united action to stop the conspiracies of the instigators of war.

We firmly believe that the forces of peace are greater than the forces of war. Peace will triumph over war! Peace must triumph over war!

　　“我们拥护和平，并坚持和平事业！”
    全苏和平大会向全世界宣告苏联人民决心争取持久和平
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十九日电：第二届全苏拥护和平大会业于十八日在莫斯科闭幕，大会通过了给出席第二届世界拥护和平大会的苏联代表的委托书如下：
    我们——来自各地参加第二届全苏拥护和平大会的苏联工人、农民与知识分子的代表们，表示我们愿与一切团结在第二届世界拥护和平大会的旗帜下争取全世界和平的战士们，精诚团结、一致行动。苏联已有一亿一千五百五十余万人，即苏联的全体成年公民，在和平宣言上签了名，他们表现了我们人民争取和平的坚定不移的意志。苏联人民对战后的复兴作了巨大的努力，现在正努力实现着进一步发展工农业、建造巨大水电站与开垦不毛之地等的伟大计划。他们与国际安全有着切身的利害关系。
    我国各民族一致赞成并支持政府所执行的斯大林和平政策。我国政府建议联大第五届会议审议《制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全的宣言》，从而再度证明了在目前紧张的国际局势之下，我国愿与一切国家和平合作的坚定愿望。
    “我们拥护和平，并坚持和平事业！”——我们伟大的领袖斯大林同志的这句话，成了我们社会主义国家——爱好和平国家的首要信条，煽动侵略的事情这里是找不到的，而且也不可能找到的。千百万的苏联人民以鄙弃的态度谴责那些帝国主义战争贩子与战争煽动者的罪恶行为，他们正以其毁灭人类的狂吠毒害着国际的气氛，他们正在各国之间散播仇恨并不断加强疯狂的军备竞赛。
    帝国主义侵略者在实现他们称霸世界的计划，向爱好和平的朝鲜人民进行了凶残的战争，占据了中国的岛屿台湾，镇压越南、马来亚、印度尼西亚等地奋起争取自由的人民，并且还武装西德过去的希特勒分子，把日本变成了军事基地。
    在这种情况下，世界各国和平拥护者必须扩大并加强他们保卫和平的活动，更紧密地团结他们的队伍，继续争取千百万人民——一切热爱和平、自由及文明的人们，不分政治信仰及宗教信仰，来为和平而斗争。帝国主义战争贩子所给予世界各国人民的威胁，都是相等的，保卫和平，所以是关系世界各国人民的。
    第二届全苏拥护和平大会，反映着苏联全体人民的意志，完全拥护世界拥护和平大会常设委员会执行局布拉格会议的决定，并委托参加第二届世界拥护和平大会的苏联代表们：
    一、向全世界宣告：苏联全体人民始终如一地致力于和平事业，愿意与世界各国和平斗士一道，坚决勇敢地为消除战争威胁，争取巩固而持久的和平而斗争；
    二、向全世界宣告：苏联人民坚定不移地要求禁止作为侵略并大批屠杀人民的原子武器，并要求宣布任何首先使用这种武器的政府为战争罪犯；
    三、向全世界宣告：我们与一切和平斗士共同要求裁减各种军备并建立有效的管制，以实现禁止原子武器并裁减军备；
    四、要求痛斥武装侵略及对各国人民内政的干涉行为。向大会表示苏联人民愤怒地抗议美国武装侵略朝鲜，抗议美机野蛮轰炸朝鲜和平居民，号召全世界的善良人民，要求立即终止朝鲜战争和撤退所有在朝鲜的外国军队；
    五、要求严格禁止新战争宣传，并遣责从事此种宣传者。向大会建议：编制战争贩子名单以使全世界一切人民知道这些最坏的罪犯和进步人类的敌人。
    我们参加第二届全苏拥护和平大会的代表，号召一切和平拥护者继续扩大和团结他们的队伍。我们号召他们共同努力以强有力的一致行动，来制止战争煽动者的阴谋。
    我们坚信和平力量大于战争力量。和平必能战胜战争！和平一定战胜战争！
