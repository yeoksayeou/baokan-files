Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd: The Nationalities' Celebration Convention held in Beijing today sent a letter of respect to Chairman Mao. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Chairman Mao:

　　On this day of our Nationalities' Celebration Convention, we extend to you our warmest respects.

　　We deeply know that it is because of your wise leadership that we have today's victory and joy. In the past long years of reactionary rule, our people of all ethnic groups were exploited and harmed, living in blood and tears. But in the past year, we have overthrown the last and most ferocious and brutal reactionary rule in history, represented by Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of American imperialism. Not only has the Han nationality been liberated, but all minority nationalities in China have also been liberated. In the past year, our people of all ethnic groups have been freed from the fate of slaves and have become masters of their own country. The victory we have achieved is a great and epoch-making victory shared by the people of all ethnic groups in China.

　　We deeply know that it is because of your wise leadership that the people of all ethnic groups in China have not only overthrown the common enemy, but also established a large family of equality, unity, friendship, love and cooperation among all ethnic groups, namely the People's Republic of China. In the past era of reactionary rule, due to the malicious instigation of the reactionary ruling class, our ethnic groups were not in harmony, and even discriminated against and hated each other. The establishment of the People's Republic of China has fundamentally changed this relationship. Our Chinese ethnic groups have begun to build our country together in a new brotherly relationship.

　　We deeply know that the great victory of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups is a disastrous defeat for reactionary forces at home and abroad; it is hated by enemies at home and abroad, especially by American imperialism, which wants to destroy it. But because of your leadership, the People's Republic of China has become a country that cannot be insulted or defeated. Any arrogant attempt by aggressors will be crushed by our iron fists. In order to consolidate and develop the victory of our people of all ethnic groups, we resolutely oppose American imperialism's aggression against Korea, oppose American imperialism's armed aggression against our country's Taiwan, protest against American imperialism's repeated violations of our country's airspace, strafing our people and infringing upon our country's sovereignty. We must, under your leadership, finally defeat any aggressive attempts by imperialism and severely suppress the remaining reactionary forces at home, so that the victory of our people of all ethnic groups can be consolidated and developed.

　　Dear Chairman Mao, your wise leadership has brought us today's great victory. We people of all ethnic groups are willing to be under your leadership forever, consolidate unity, continue to work hard, and strive for greater victories tomorrow.

　　We shout:

　　Long live the victory of the liberation cause of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups!

　　Long live the great unity of all ethnic groups in China!

　　Long live the People's Republic of China!

　　Long live the organizer and leader of the Chinese people's liberation cause—the Communist Party of China!

　　Long live our people of all ethnic groups' leader and mentor, our dearest Chairman Mao!

　　Nationalities' Celebration Convention
　　October 22, 1950

　　中华各民族联欢大会
    写信向毛主席致敬
    【新华社二十二日讯】今日在北京举行的中华各民族联欢大会致函毛主席致敬，该函全文如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    我们在举行各民族联欢大会的今天，谨向您致最亲热的敬礼。
    我们深深的知道，由于有您英明的领导，我们才有胜利、愉快的今天。在过去长时期的反动统治年代里，我们各民族人民是被压榨与被损害的，在血与泪中过着日子。可是一年来，我们已将历史上最后一个最凶恶、最残暴的、以美帝国主义走狗蒋介石为代表的国民党反动统治推翻了，不仅汉民族得了解放，中国各少数民族也都得了解放。一年来，我们各民族人民都摆脱了奴隶的命运而做了自己国家的主人。我们已获得的胜利，是中国各民族人民所共有的划时代的伟大的胜利。
    我们深深的知道，由于有您英明的领导，中国各民族人民不仅打倒了共同的敌人，而且建立了一个各民族平等、团结、友爱、合作的大家庭，即中华人民共和国。在过去反动统治时代，由于反动统治阶级的恶意挑拨，我们各民族之间是不和好，甚至是彼此歧视和仇视的。中华人民共和国的建立，从根本上改变了这种关系，我们中国各民族已经以新的兄弟般的关系来共同建设我们的国家。
    我们深深的知道，中国各民族人民的伟大胜利，就是国内外反动势力的惨重失败；是为国内外的敌人所仇视，特别是为美帝国主义所仇视而欲加以破坏的。可是因为有您的领导，中华人民共和国已经成为一个不可侮慢、不可战胜的国家。任何侵略者的狂妄企图，都将为我们的铁拳所粉碎。为巩固和发展我们各民族人民的胜利，我们坚决反对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜，反对美帝国主义武装侵略我国的台湾，抗议美帝国主义一再侵犯我国领空，扫射我国人民并侵犯我国主权。我们必须在您的领导下最后击溃帝国主义的任何侵略企图并严厉镇压国内残余的反革命势力，我们各民族人民的胜利才能巩固和发展。
    亲爱的毛主席，您的英明的领导，给我们带来了今天的伟大的胜利。我们各民族人民愿意永远在您的领导下，巩固团结、继续努力，为争取明天的更大的胜利而奋斗。
    我们高呼：
    中国各民族人民解放事业胜利万岁！
    中国各民族大团结万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民解放事业的组织者与领导者——中国共产党万岁！
    我们各民族人民的领袖和导师、最亲爱的毛主席万岁！
        中华各民族联欢大会
              一九五零年十月二十二日
