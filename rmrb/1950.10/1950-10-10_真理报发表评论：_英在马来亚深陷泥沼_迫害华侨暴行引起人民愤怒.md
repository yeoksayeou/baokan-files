　　*Pravda* Publishes Commentary:
    British are Mired in Malaya
    Atrocities of Persecuting Overseas Chinese Arouse People's Anger
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th] TASS Moscow reports: *Pravda* international commentator Vasilyev, in an article, commented that the British imperialists are already in an inescapable situation in their colonial war to suppress the Malayan national liberation movement; and their brutal acts of instigating national disputes and frantically persecuting overseas Chinese in Malaya will not save them from their fate of failure in Malaya.

    Vasilyev pointed out: By the end of last year, British imperialism had mobilized at least 130,000 troops and police to wage a colonial war against the Malayan people. In eight months of war, it has lost more than 12,000 people (deaths) and spent a lot of money. Tanks, planes, killings and prisons cannot frustrate the fighting spirit of the Malayan people. The Malayan National Liberation Army is growing and strengthening, and the national liberation struggle has spread to the entire Malayan region.

    Vasilyev continued: After the failure of the Malayan British colonial authorities' attempt to provoke disputes among various ethnic groups in Malaya, they turned to attack the overseas Chinese in Malaya. For many months, overseas Chinese residents have been subjected to abuse and retaliation by the authorities. Overseas Chinese are being unreasonably imprisoned and deported from Malaya; a few days ago, the British colonial authorities even closed down the Chinese people's newspapers. The shameless high-handed measures of the British colonialists in Malaya have aroused not only the anger of the Malayan people, but also the anger of people outside Malaya.

    Vasilyev pointed out in conclusion: The British Labour government's support for the US imperialists' aggression in Korea has once again proved to the Malayan people that the US and British imperialists are the deadly enemies of the Eastern people, and that this enemy intends to eliminate millions of people in order to plunder and make a fortune. The Malayan people are uniting their ranks and fighting against the imperialist enslavers.

　　真理报发表评论：
    英在马来亚深陷泥沼
    迫害华侨暴行引起人民愤怒
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报国际评论员瓦西里耶夫，著文评论英帝国主义者在镇压马来亚民族解放运动的殖民战争中，已陷入不能自拔的境地；而其挑拨民族纠纷及疯狂迫害马来亚华侨的残暴行为，也挽救不了其在马来亚的失败命运。
    瓦西里耶夫指出：到去年年底为止，英帝国主义动员了至少十三万军警对马来亚人民进行殖民战争。在八个月的战争中，它已损失了一万二千余人（死亡），并花费了大量钱财。坦克、飞机、枪杀和监狱，都挫折不了马来亚人民的战斗精神，马来亚民族解放军正在成长壮大，民族解放斗争已扩展到马来亚整个地区。
    瓦西里耶夫继称：马来亚英殖民当局在挑拨马来亚各民族纠纷的企图失败之后，竟转而扑向马来亚华侨。许多月来，华侨居民受到当局的虐待与报复。华侨被无理监禁和驱逐出马来亚；数日前，英国殖民当局更封闭了中国人民的报纸。马来亚英殖民者无耻的高压手段，不仅引起了马来亚人民的愤怒，而且引起了马来亚以外的人民的愤怒。
    瓦西里耶夫在结语中指出：英工党政府支持美帝国主义者在朝鲜的侵略，已再度向马来亚人民证明：美英帝国主义者是东方人民的死敌，这个敌人为了抢劫和发财，打算消灭千百万的人民。马来亚人民正在团结他们的队伍，向帝国主义奴役者进行斗争。
