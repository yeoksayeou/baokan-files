　　The Dying Struggle of Imperialism
　　Wu Yaozong
　　For a year, the attempts of the imperialists to create war have progressed from the stage of preparation and propaganda to the stage of action; the US imperialist aggression against Korea and Taiwan is the beginning of this new stage. On the surface, this kind of action seems to be a demonstration of the power of the imperialists, but in reality, they are outwardly strong but inwardly weak, "forced to this point" because the growth of the world's peaceful and democratic forces has made them feel seriously threatened, forcing them to use adventurous actions as a last-ditch struggle. Among the radicals of the warmongers, some even want to launch a third world war before the time is ripe, taking pre-emptive action as a desperate gamble. However, under the powerful anti-war forces of the world's people today, the outbreak of war is probably not as easy as they imagine. To go a step further, even if they disregard everything and really launch a war, we can say with certainty that it will be the end of imperialism.

　　帝国主义垂死的挣扎
    吴耀宗
    一年以来，帝国主义者制造战争的企图，已经从准备和宣传的阶段，进展到行动的阶段；美帝的侵略朝鲜台湾，就是这一个新阶段的开端。从表面上看，这一种行动似乎是帝国主义者力量的表现，但实际上它们是外强中干，“实逼处此”，因为全世界和平民主力量的增涨，使它们感受到严重的威胁，使他们不得不用冒险的行动来作最后的挣扎。在战争贩子们的急进派中，甚至有人想在时机没有成熟的时候，发动第三次大战，以先发制人之举，做孤注之一掷。但是，在今天全世界人民反战的强大力量之下，大战的发动，恐怕不是他们所想像那么容易的。退一步说，即使他们不顾一切，真的发动大战，我们可以断然地说：那将是帝国主义的末日。
