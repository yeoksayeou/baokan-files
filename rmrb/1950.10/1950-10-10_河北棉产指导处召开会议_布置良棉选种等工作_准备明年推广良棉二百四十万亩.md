The Hebei Provincial People's Government Department of Agriculture Cotton Production Improvement Guidance Office held a meeting of directors of cotton production guidance zones and cotton ginning factory directors from August 25th to 31st in order to do a good job in this year's fine cotton seed selection, cotton picking and seed preservation, and to lay the foundation for the promotion of fine cotton next year. The meeting first estimated the growth status and yield of fine cotton in the province this year: a total of 853,434 mu of fine cotton were sown in nine guidance zones and 31 counties and towns, exceeding the original plan of 800,000 mu. However, due to disasters such as diseases, insects, hail, water, and wind and sand, a total of 82,425 mu of cotton fields were destroyed, and the existing area reached 771,009 mu. Among them, Tongxian and Tianjin areas suffered heavy water disasters, resulting in reduced production or no hope of harvest, while other areas can expect a bumper harvest. According to the estimated yield based on the existing cotton field area (including those in Tongxian, Tianjin and other areas that suffered production reductions due to water disasters), the average yield per mu can reach 104 jin of seed cotton, equivalent to 34 jin of lint, exceeding the original requirement of 29 jin per mu by 5 jin.

The meeting focused on discussing seed selection and cotton picking and seed preservation work. It was decided that, on the basis of the province's existing fine varieties, in addition to cotton picking and seed preservation in each zone, the most important task is to carry out mass cotton seed selection activities; to further improve the existing fine varieties to meet specifications. In addition to planning and purchasing 34,887,700 jin of seed cotton of fine varieties in each zone, the masses will be mobilized to select and retain 11,453,760 jin of seeds for use in promoting fine varieties on 2.4 million mu next year. The meeting pointed out that in the process of seed selection, it is mainly necessary to rely on organizing the masses, implement the policy of "better cotton, better price," and complete the seed selection work. The meeting also studied and arranged issues such as processing and ensuring purity, preventing mold and rot, doing a good job in separate harvesting, separate ginning, separate storage, strengthening fire protection equipment, and establishing fire protection systems.

　　河北棉产指导处召开会议
    布置良棉选种等工作
    准备明年推广良棉二百四十万亩
    【本报讯】河北省人民政府农业厅棉产改进指导处为做好今年良棉的选种、收花保种等工作，打下明年推广良棉基础，于八月二十五日至三十一日召开了各棉产指导区主任、轧花厂长会议。会议首先对今年全省良棉生育状况及产量作了估计：今年九个指导区、三十一个县镇共播种良棉八十五万三千四百三十四亩，超过了原订八十万亩的计划。但因遭受病、虫、雹、水、风沙等灾害，共毁弃棉田八万二千四百二十五亩，现存面积共达七十七万一千零九亩。其中通县、天津两区以水灾较重而减产或收成无望，其他各区均可丰收。按现存在棉田面积（通、津等区因水灾减产者在内）产量估计，每亩平均可收籽棉一百零四斤，折皮棉三十四斤，比原来每亩二十九斤的要求超过五斤。
    会议着重讨论了选种与收花保种工作。决定在该省现有良种的基础上，除各区收花保种外，最主要的是开展群众性的棉花选种运动；使现有良种进一步的提高，以合乎规格。各区除计划、收购良种三千四百八十八万七千斤籽棉外，并发动群众选自留种一千一百四十五万三千七百六十斤，以作明年推广良种二百四十万亩的籽种之用。会议指出：在选种工作进行中，主要依靠组织群众，贯彻优棉优价政策，完成选种工作。会议对加工保纯，防止霉烂，作好分收、分轧、分存及加强防火设备，建立防火制度等问题，都作了研究与布置。
