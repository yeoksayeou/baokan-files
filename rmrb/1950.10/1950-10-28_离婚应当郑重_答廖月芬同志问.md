    Divorce Should Be Treated Seriously
        In Response to Comrade Liao Yuefen's Question
Editor Comrades:
    Recently, I saw a very infuriating thing. There is a female comrade in our organization, who is in her twenties this year. She is very capable in her work, very enthusiastic in treating people, and also a good wife in her family. Her marriage with her husband (a Party member cadre) went through a relatively long period of courtship. And now they have been married for seven or eight years and have three or four children. Their relationship was originally very good, but since the liberation of Beijing, the man's attitude towards her has suddenly changed. He expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that his wife had not attended university and was not proficient in foreign languages, often using hurtful words to stimulate her for no reason, deliberately causing small quarrels. As a result, he proposed a divorce to the woman on the grounds that "the woman wants to work independently and cannot be the man's secretary and assistant, which does not help the man's work" and "frequent quarrels and emotional discord."
    The woman felt that the two sides had a good relationship in the past, and they already had a group of children, so she was unwilling to divorce and repeatedly tried to compromise. The man intensified his efforts to create rifts. Every Saturday or Sunday, he always made excuses that he was busy with work and did not allow his wife to go to him; but on the other hand, he found a girlfriend. When the woman protested, the man sternly scolded her, saying, "I have freedom, you can't control me. If you don't want to divorce, I will create a fait accompli. See what you can do!" In addition, he often verbally abused his wife and was irresponsible to his children.
    The man also said to the woman, "The Marriage Law stipulates that if one party insists on a divorce, they can get a divorce without any reason. Divorce and marriage are personal matters, who can do anything to me!"
    Now, he has stimulated his wife to the point of almost having a nervous breakdown. I was very angry when I saw this, but I don't know enough about this issue to express my opinion lightly. Now I raise a few questions, hoping you can answer:
    1. Is the man's understanding of the freedom of divorce in the Marriage Law correct? If the man files for divorce in court, and the woman firmly refuses to divorce, how will the court rule?
    2. Is the man's statement that "the woman wants to work independently and cannot be the man's secretary and assistant, which does not help the man's work" correct? Can this be used as a reason for divorce?
    The reason I didn't write the names of the parties involved in the letter is to avoid making their relationship worse. Please forgive me.

Comrade Liao Yuefen:
    Based on the situation reflected in the letter, our opinions are as follows:
    1. The man said, "The Marriage Law stipulates that if one party insists on a divorce, they can get a divorce without any reason." This is a distortion of the Marriage Law. On the one hand, the People's Government guarantees freedom of divorce, and at the same time opposes rash and careless divorce. Article 17 of the Marriage Law stipulates that "if both men and women voluntarily apply for divorce, divorce shall be granted," and also stipulates the serious and prudent legal procedures for realizing this freedom of divorce, in order to oppose rash divorce. If one party insists on divorce, and mediation is ineffective, the court will make a judgment based on the specific circumstances; if there is a legitimate reason why the husband and wife relationship cannot continue, a judgment granting divorce should be made, otherwise, a judgment not granting divorce can also be made.
    2. According to the provisions of Article 1 of the Marriage Law, equality between men and women is one of the basic principles of the new-democratic marriage system. Chapter 3 of the Marriage Law, "Rights and Obligations between Husband and Wife," specifically stipulates that husband and wife "have equal status in the family," "have the obligation to love, respect, and help each other," and "both parties have the freedom to choose a profession, participate in work, and participate in social activities." It is obviously contrary to the principles of the new-democratic marriage system and the provisions of the Marriage Law for either party to disallow the other party to work independently, violate the other party's voluntariness, and unilaterally emphasize the wife's help to themselves. Neither party should use this as a reason to demand a divorce from the other party.

### 离婚应当郑重  答廖月芬同志问

　　离婚应当郑重
    答廖月芬同志问编辑同志：
    最近我看到一件令人非常气愤的事。我们机关里有一位女同志，今年二十几岁。她工作能力很不错，待人很热情，在家庭中也是一个好妻子。她和她丈夫（党员干部）的结合曾经过了较长期的恋爱过程。而且到现在已结婚七八年了，现有三四个孩子。他们的感情原来很好，但自北京解放后，男方对她的态度突然起了变化。他对妻子没有住过大学、不精通外国文这点表示不满，经常毫无道理地用一些伤感情的话刺激她，故意引起一些小的口角。结果，就借口“女方要独立工作，不能当男方的秘书和助手，对男方工作上没有帮助”和“经常口角，感情不和”两个理由向女方提出离婚。
    女方感到双方过去感情不错，而且已有一群孩子，不愿离婚，再三委曲求全。男方就变本加厉地制造裂缝，每逢星期六或星期日，他总是借口工作忙，不让妻子到他那儿去；但另一方面他又找了一个女友。女方提出抗议时，男方厉声斥骂说：“我有自由，你管不着。你不愿离婚，我会造成既成事实。看你怎么办？”此外，并经常辱骂妻子，对子女不负责任。
    男方又曾对女方说：“婚姻法规定：单方坚决要求离婚，就可以离婚，用不着什么理由。离婚，结婚，是个人问题，谁能奈何我！”
    现在，他把他的妻子刺激得快要神经失常了。我看了很气愤，但自己对这一问题认识不够，不便轻率表示意见。现在我提出几个问题，希望您们答复：
    一、男方对婚姻法离婚自由的认识，是否正确？如果男方向法院提出离婚，女方坚决不离，法院将如何判决？
    二、男方说：“女方要独立工作，不能当男方的秘书和助手，对男方工作上没有帮助。”这种看法是否正确？这是否可作为离婚的理由？
    我在信中所以不写明当事人的姓名，是为了避免使他们双方关系更恶劣。请原谅。
    廖月芬廖月芬同志：
    根据来信所反映的情况，我们的意见如下：
    一、男方说：“婚姻法规定：单方坚决要求离婚，就可以离婚，用不着什么理由。”这是对婚姻法的曲解。人民政府一方面保障离婚自由，同时又反对轻率马虎的离婚。婚姻法第十七条在规定了“男女双方自愿离婚的，准予离婚”以后，又规定了实现这种离婚自由的严肃慎重的法律程序，以反对轻率离婚。如果一方坚决要求离婚，而调解无效时，法院即根据具体情况予以判决；有正当理由不能继续夫妻关系的，应作准予离婚的判决，否则也可作不准予离婚的判决。
    二、根据婚姻法第一条的规定，男女权利平等是新民主主义婚姻制度基本原则之一。婚姻法第三章“夫妻间的权利和义务”中又具体规定：夫妻“在家庭中地位平等”，“有互爱互敬、互相帮助”的义务，“双方均有选择职业、参加工作和参加社会活动的自由”。任何一方不许对方独立工作、违反对方自愿而片面地强调妻子对自己的帮助，显然是违背新民主主义婚姻制度的原则和婚姻法的规定的。任何一方不应以此为理由要求和对方离婚。
