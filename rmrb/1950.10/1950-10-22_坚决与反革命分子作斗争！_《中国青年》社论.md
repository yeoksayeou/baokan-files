　　Resolutely Struggle Against Counter-Revolutionaries!
    《China Youth》Editorial

    Loving the motherland and loving the people are important qualities of patriotic youth and Youth League members. Whoever loves the motherland and loves the people will surely hate counter-revolutionaries and be determined to wage a resolute and merciless struggle against the scum of counter-revolution. Because counter-revolutionaries want to destroy our revolutionary cause and destroy the People's Republic of China, which we are painstakingly building. They are the ferocious enemies of our country and people.

    The victory of the Chinese People's Great Revolution has overthrown the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China. But they will not willingly accept their demise, and they are stubbornly making a desperate struggle,妄想 to restore their power and re-ascend the throne of oppressing the people. One of their despicable means is to use various counter-revolutionaries to carry out activities to sabotage the new People's China. The number of these counter-revolutionaries is still large, mainly including Kuomintang secret agents, political bandits, the leaders of reactionary secret societies, and finally, international spies directly dispatched by imperialists. The headquarters and main base of these counter-revolutionaries are the most dangerous enemy of the Chinese nation, American imperialism. The American aggressors not only openly militarily invade our sacred territory of Taiwan and strafe and bomb our northeastern border, but also collect and assist all counter-revolutionary secret agents and bandits to harm our country, directly directing and helping them to carry out various conspiracies and crimes.

    Since the outbreak of the American war of aggression against Korea, the American attempt to expand the war of aggression in the East has become increasingly obvious. At this time, many counter-revolutionary bandits thought there was an opportunity to take advantage of, and they carried out their activities even more frantically. For example, in some areas, the Kuomintang-organized bandits who had been put down had a resurgence; in some places, bandits and secret agents attacked district and village governments and killed cadres, causing many of our cadres to sacrifice their lives; in some enterprises and mines, sabotage activities occurred, destroying state property and disrupting production and transportation; in some places, bandits and secret agents planned to create absurd rumors, spreading these rumors through feudal secret societies, taking advantage of the cultural backwardness of the masses, in order to disrupt the peaceful life and production construction of the countryside. Other activities, such as assassination, poisoning, sowing discord, stealing secrets, and restoring counter-revolutionary organizational ties, have also been significantly strengthened. In addition, there are many secret agents who have been discovered by the government, pretended to repent, and obtained lenient treatment, but have returned to their evil ways. These counter-revolutionaries are all carrying out various dark activities with the direct and indirect support of imperialism.

    Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us not to lose our vigilance against the reactionaries. In his opening address at the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, he specifically instructed us: "After the country is pacified, they (referring to imperialists and domestic reactionaries) will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways. They will try to restore their rule in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable, without any doubt, and we must not relax our vigilance." It is ridiculous if we attribute the intensification of these conspiratorial activities of the counter-revolutionaries to the enemy's stubbornness and viciousness. The enemies of the people have never been willing to withdraw from the stage of history, and they have always been vicious to the extreme. What should be emphasized is that some revolutionaries have forgotten Chairman Mao's teachings and are 麻痹 to the counter-revolutionaries. Some comrades have a one-sided understanding of the Party's policy of combining suppression and leniency towards counter-revolutionaries, and distort the policy of leniency, so that they do not resolutely suppress even the most heinous and determined counter-revolutionaries, and instead of imposing extreme penalties everywhere, they give them undue leniency, and even release them at will. This phenomenon of losing the revolutionary stand and violating the Common Program and national interests has caused the people to complain about our "boundless leniency." This unprincipled "leniency" is actually letting the tiger return to the mountain and the snake return to the ravine, it is conniving with evil, and it is helping the enemy. Sometimes, as a result of this wrong approach, some people who actively help the government to fight against the counter-revolutionaries are cruelly retaliated against by the counter-revolutionaries, which greatly damages the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses to resolutely fight against the counter-revolutionaries. This serious phenomenon can no longer be ignored. It will bring serious consequences to our motherland, cause major damage to our people's democratic dictatorship, or it will make us pay greater and unnecessary costs and sacrifices on the road to victory.

    Resolutely fighting against counter-revolutionaries and resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries is a serious struggle in our country. 麻痹 toward the enemy, ignorance of the viciousness and tenacity of the reactionaries in their death throes, and the vague concepts of "benevolence" and "non-retaliation" without a stand towards determined counter-revolutionaries are all the greatest harm to the country. This is a manifestation of a lack of practical understanding of class struggle, and it is also a manifestation of an unyielding revolutionary stand. Both Gorky and Lu Xun have revealed these bloody lessons to the people. Gorky said: "Tolerance of the enemy (note) is cruelty to comrades." Lu Xun said that if we do not beat the drowning dog, if we take a "compassionate" attitude towards the ghosts and monsters of the counter-revolution, if we "mistake indulgence of evil for leniency," then "we will have to spend more and more energy and life." "The harm of the anti-reformers to the reformers has never been relaxed, and the means have been extremely powerful. Only the reformers are still asleep, always suffering losses, so China has always been without reform. From now on, some attitudes and methods should be changed."

    Patriots must resolutely oppose the counter-revolutionary enemies of the people. Not daring to fight against the enemies of the people, not willing to fight, is a manifestation of insufficient patriotism. Therefore, the attitude towards counter-revolution is the watershed between having patriotism and revolutionary stand. In the first year since the establishment of our young republic by the Central People's Government, it has completed the great achievements that no government in history could make. Activities that sabotage our country are intolerable to any patriotic person. We must have a high degree of vigilance and "offensive spirit" towards all counter-revolutionary crimes that sabotage the country. In particular, if a patriotic youth or Youth League member is determined to be a good son or daughter of the people, if he turns a blind eye to the destructive activities of counter-revolutionaries, to the rumors and slanders spread by counter-revolutionaries, without vigilance, without investigation, without struggle, he has made a mistake and should be criticized. If he is a League member, he should also be given necessary disciplinary action by the League organization. On the other hand, those who have a high degree of vigilance against counter-revolutionary activities and carry out resolute struggles should be encouraged and praised. These criticisms, punishments, encouragements, and praises are necessary to educate League members and the masses, and to improve our fighting will and discipline in the struggle against the enemies of the people.

    Regarding the activities of counter-revolutionaries, our Youth League members and League organizations should, under the leadership of the Party and government, unite the masses and carry out serious and conscientious struggles. First of all, we must universally carry out education and ideological mobilization for resolutely fighting against counter-revolutionaries and resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionary activities, so that every patriotic youth and Youth League member does not regard this struggle against counter-revolutionaries as a "none of my business" issue, but as a task that cannot be relaxed for a moment. Everyone must raise their indignation against American aggressors and domestic reactionaries and their vigilance against counter-revolutionary activities to the highest degree. To this end, we must use various means of propaganda and education, such as lectures and reports, publishing books and pamphlets, writing poems, plays, and movies, to carry out anti-counter-revolutionary education. Many Soviet films and novels that describe the struggle against counter-revolutionaries are good teaching materials and can be promoted and disseminated. Second, we must actively organize the struggle against counter-revolutionary activities. Expose the rumors of counter-revolutionaries and positively publicize the current situation and various policies. The propaganda departments of League committees at all levels and League newspapers should regularly combine with the ideological trends of the masses to expose and refute the propaganda and rumors of counter-revolutionaries. The organization and work of propagandists should be strengthened, the content of League lessons must include current affairs education, and it must be carried out conscientiously. When counter-revolutionary activities are discovered, they must be reported to the public security organs and assist them in their work. Third, we must tighten our own ranks and organizations, and strengthen various systems and measures to preserve state secrets. We must ensure that the enemy has no chance to take advantage of it. We must criticize the idea of only seeking "convenience" and "expediency," thereby neglecting or destroying various systems and procedures for preventing hidden enemies.

    In this serious struggle task, we must never forget the importance of uniting ourselves. Our three enemies are isolated, "rats running across the street, everyone shouting 'kill them'." Their ghostly actions are despicable, dark, and cannot be seen in the light of day. And our friends are numerous, closely united on the solid political foundation of the Common Program. Our people's democratic dictatorship is becoming increasingly consolidated and increasing its power. Our struggle against counter-revolution is a just action to defend the country and is enthusiastically supported by the broad masses. We must mobilize and unite all the people and youth to carry it out together in order to achieve the greatest effect. We must correct the mistake that some of our comrades in the past have been "boundlessly lenient" to the enemy, which to some extent has hindered the enthusiasm of the masses to fight against the counter-revolution. We must earnestly raise the enthusiasm of the masses. At the same time, we must conduct this struggle with a clear mind and analysis and proceed prudently. We must adhere to the principle of "the chief culprits must be brought to justice, the coerced will not be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded," and we must distinguish between enemy and friend, and distinguish between right and wrong in various reactionary or erroneous behaviors. We must not be impatient or reckless. For some erroneous ideas that may arise in our cadres and our friends, such as the so-called "do not resist evil with evil," "benevolence," "do not retaliate" based on supra-class views, we must conduct patient and sincere persuasive education. It should be pointed out to them that for more than a year since the establishment of our Central People's Government, we have made the longest, most patient, and lenient waiting and leniency for the reactionary elements who have done many evils, and we have done our best. If these reactionary elements still not only have no remorse, do not want to confess and repent to redeem their past sins, but also regard the government's lenient policy as deceivable,妄存 a fluke, despise the sword of the people's democratic dictatorship, and even after receiving lenient treatment, they engage in counter-revolutionary activities again, all of which proves that they are determined to be enemies of the people, cut themselves off from the country, and cut themselves off from the people. These national moths cannot be forgiven. Only in this way can we unite the masses, advance together to defeat the enemy, and prevent the enemy's any provocation conspiracy from succeeding.

    Patriotic youth, Youth League members, do your best to defend our new People's China and show your patriotic enthusiasm!
(Note) Refers to enemies who are determined and do not sincerely repent

　　坚决与反革命分子作斗争！
    《中国青年》社论
    热爱祖国和热爱人民，是爱国青年、青年团员重要的品质。谁热爱祖国热爱人民，谁就一定痛恨反革命分子，决心向反革命的败类做坚决无情的斗争。因为反革命分子要破坏我们的革命事业，要破坏我们正在艰难缔造着的中华人民共和国。他们是我们国家和人民的凶恶的敌人。
    中国人民大革命的胜利已经推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治。但他们是不会甘心死亡的，他们顽强地在作垂死挣扎，妄想复辟，重登压迫人民的宝座。他们的卑鄙手段之一就是运用各种反革命分子进行破坏人民新中国的活动。这些反革命分子数量还很大，主要是包括国民党的特务分子、政治土匪、反动会门道门中的首要，最后还有帝国主义者直接派遣的国际间谍。这些反革命分子的总司令部和大本营，就是中华民族最危险的敌人美帝国主义。美国侵略者不只公开在军事上侵略我们的神圣领土台湾，扫射轰炸我们的东北边疆，还收集并援助一切反革命特务匪徒来危害我们的国家，直接指挥与帮助他们进行各种阴谋罪行。
    自从美国侵略朝鲜的战争爆发以来，美国扩大东方侵略战争的企图日益明显，这时，许多反革命匪徒以为有机可乘，更加疯狂地进行其活动。例如，在有些地区国民党编成的土匪骚乱原已剿除了，现在又有死灰复燃之势；在有些地方，匪特袭击区村政权杀害干部，使我们有不少的干部牺牲了性命；在有些企业工矿中发生暗害和破坏活动，毁坏了国家资财，扰乱了生产和运输；在有些地方匪特有计划地制造荒谬无稽的谣言，通过封建性的会道门，利用群众的文化落后而传播着这些谣言，以扰乱农村的和平生活和生产建设。其它如暗杀放毒、挑拨离间、盗窃机密、恢复反革命组织联系等活动，也都显着加强了。此外，也有不少业经政府发现而伪装改悔取得宽大待遇的特务分子又重新为非作歹。这些反革命分子都在帝国主义的直接和间接的支援下，进行各种黑暗的活动。
    毛主席曾屡次教导我们不能丧失对反动派的警惕性，他在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议的开幕词中，特别指示我们：“在全国平定以后，他们（指帝国主义和国内反动派）也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”可见，如果我们要把反革命的这些阴谋活动的加剧，归咎于敌人的顽固狠毒，那就太可笑了。人民的敌人从来就不愿自甘退出历史舞台，并且从来是狠毒得无以复加的。应当着重检讨的，是有些革命者忘记了毛主席的教训，竟对反革命分子麻痹。有些同志，片面了解党对待反革命镇压与宽大相结合的政策，并曲解宽大政策，以至对于罪大恶极的坚决反革命分子也不加以坚决的镇压，一直到处以极刑，反而曲予宽容，甚至随便释放。这种失去革命立场，违反共同纲领与国家利益的现象，造成了人民群众对我们“宽大无边”的怨言。这种无原则的“宽大”实际上就是放虎归山、放蛇归壑，就是纵恶，就是帮助敌人。有时由于这种错误的做法的结果，使得一些积极帮助政府向反革命斗争的人民群众，反而受到反革命分子残酷的报复，这就大大损害了群众向反革命坚决斗争的热情和积极性。这种严重的现象已不容再加以忽视。它将给我们的祖国带来严重的后果，给我们的人民民主专政以重大损害，或者将使我们在向胜利前进的路上，多付出不应付出的重大的代价和牺牲。
    坚决向反革命斗争，坚决镇压反革命，是我们国家当前的严重的斗争。对敌人麻痹，对反动派垂死挣扎时的狠毒性顽强性的无知，对坚决反革命分子毫无立场的“仁爱”与“勿报复”的糊涂观念，都是对国家最大的危害，这是缺乏阶级斗争的实际认识的表现，也是革命立场不坚定的表现。不论是高尔基和鲁迅，都曾把这方面的血的教训昭示人民。高尔基说过：“对敌人的宽容（注），就是对同志的残忍”，鲁迅说过，如果不打落水狗，如果对反革命的鬼蜮抱“慈悲”态度，如果“误将纵恶当做宽容”，那么“就要花费更多更多的气力和生命。”“反改革者对于改革者的毒害，向来就并未放松过，手段的厉害也已经无以复加了。只有改革者却还在睡梦里，总是吃亏，因而中国也总是没有改革，自此以后，是应该改换些态度和方法的。”
    爱国者必须坚决反对反革命的人民敌人。对人民敌人不敢斗争、不愿斗争，就是爱国心不够的表现。因此，对待反革命采取什么态度，就是有无爱国主义精神和革命立场的分水岭。我们的年青的共和国在中央人民政府建立以来的第一年当中，就完成了历史上任何一个政府所不能做出的伟大成绩。破坏我们的国家的活动，是任何爱国分子所不能容忍的。对于破坏国家的一切反革命罪行，我们必须具有高度的警惕性和“攻击精神”。尤其是一个爱国青年或青年团员，既然立志要做人民的好儿女，如果对于反革命的破坏活动，对于反革命散布的谣言和诽谤，熟视无睹，不加警惕，不加追究，不进行斗争，就是犯了错误，应该受到批评，如果他是一个团员还应受到团组织必要的处分。另一面，对于反革命活动具有高度警惕并进行坚决斗争的人，就应受到鼓励和表扬，这些批评处分和鼓励表扬，都是必要的，是为了教育团员和群众，用以提高我们向人民公敌斗争的战斗意志和纪律性。
    对于反革命的活动，我们青年团员和团的组织，应该在党政领导下，团结群众进行严肃认真的斗争。首先，要普遍进行坚决向反革命分子斗争和坚决镇压反革命活动的教育和思想动员，使得每一爱国青年和青年团员都不要把这种斗争反革命当做“事不关己”的问题，而当做一时一刻也不放松的任务，必须使每一个人都提高对美国侵略者和国内反动派的义愤和提高对反革命活动的警惕到最高度。为此，必须利用各种宣传教育方式，如讲演报告，出版图书小册子，编写诗歌剧本电影，进行反对反革命的教育，而许多叙述反对反革命斗争的苏联电影和小说都是很好的教材，可以推广和传播。第二，主动组织向反革命活动的斗争。揭破反革命的谣言，正面宣传时局动态和各项政策。各级团委宣传部门和团报，要经常结合群众思想动态，针对反革命的宣传和谣言而予以揭穿。宣传员的组织和工作均应加强，团课内容必须加入时事教育，并认真进行。在发现反革命活动时，必须向公安机关报告，并协助其工作。第三，严密自己的队伍和组织，加强保守国家机密的各种制度和措施。务使做到敌人无隙可乘。必须批评这种思想，即只贪图“省事”“方便”，因而忽视或破坏防范暗藏敌人的各项制度和手续。
    在这一严重斗争任务中，我们绝不要忘记团结自己的重要。我们的三个敌人，是孤立的，是“老鼠过街，人人喊打”的。他们的鬼蜮行动是卑鄙黑暗，见不得天日的。而我们的朋友，是众多的，是亲密团结在共同纲领的巩固政治基础上的，我们的人民民主专政是日益巩固和日益增强其威力的。我们的反对反革命的斗争，是保卫国家的正义行动，是广大群众所热忱拥护的；也必须动员和团结全体人民和青年来共同进行，才能收到最大的效果。我们必须纠正这一错误，即由于我们过去有些同志对敌人“宽大无边”而在某种程度上妨害了群众反对反革命斗争的积极性。必须把群众的热情认真提高起来。同时我们又必须头脑清醒而有分析地慎重进行这一斗争，我们要坚持“首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖”的原则，并对于各种反动的或错误的行为，要分清敌友，分清是非轻重，不要急躁鲁莽；对于我们的干部和我们的朋友中有些人可能产生的错误思想，即基于超阶级观点的所谓“勿以恶抗恶”，“仁恕”，“勿报复”等观念，必须进行耐心诚恳的说服教育。应该向他们指出，我们中央人民政府成立的一年多以来，对于曾经作恶多端的反动分子，已经作了长期的最耐心的等待和宽大，已做到仁至而义尽，如果这些反动分子，至今仍不仅毫无悔祸之心，不愿坦白改过以赎前愆，反而以政府的宽大政策为可欺，妄存侥幸之心，邈视人民民主专政的利剑，甚至在受到宽大待遇后，又复从事反革命活动，这都证明他们是决心与人民为敌，自绝于国家，自绝于人民，对于这些国家蟊贼是不能宽恕的。只有这样，我们才能团结群众，一道前进战胜敌人，并使敌人的任何挑拨阴谋无法得售。
    爱国青年们，青年团员们，为保卫我们人民的新中国而尽自己的力量，表现出自己的爱国热忱啊！
  （注）指对坚决而不真心改悔的敌人
