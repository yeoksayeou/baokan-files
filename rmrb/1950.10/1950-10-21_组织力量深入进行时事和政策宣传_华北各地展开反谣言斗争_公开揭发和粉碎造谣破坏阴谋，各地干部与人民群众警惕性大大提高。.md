Xinhua News Agency, 20th. North China has been organizing propaganda forces to conduct in-depth publicity on current affairs and policies among the people, publicly exposing the rumor-mongering activities of special agents, and shattering the sabotage conspiracies of special agent bandits and reactionary secret societies to spread rumors, confuse the public, and disrupt people's minds. In the work of crushing counter-revolutionary rumors, various localities have adopted various methods of propaganda and education. In many counties in Shanxi Province, meetings of county, district, and village cadres, ranging from three or four hundred to over a thousand people, have been convened to discuss the situation in the Korean War, the American invasion of Taiwan, and the characteristics of the rumor-mongering activities of special agents, and to conduct current affairs education to the masses through cadres. Fanshi County alone held more than 200 various forms of discussion groups and mass meetings in carrying out mass propaganda. The Yuci Special District of the province also used various models, cartoons, and slides for propaganda to help people specifically understand the rumor-mongering activities of special agents. In Yuci City, the anti-rumor slideshow was viewed by 10,000 people in seven days, and farmers from nearby villages rushed to watch it. Counter-revolutionary special agents in the Huxi Special District of Pingyuan Province had engaged in destructive propaganda against the people's government's policies on public grain burdens and development of production. However, when cadres in the district publicly explained to the farmers, with concrete examples, the role of these policies in rewarding production, the rumors were completely debunked. Many farmers said: "We were already half-believing and half-doubting when we heard those rumors in the past, but now we understand it clearly." Farmers in many villages forced the rumor-mongers to admit their mistakes in public.

    Local people's governments also promptly exposed the activities of special agent bandits who used reactionary secret societies and superstitions to deceive the masses and spread rumors. The Xin County Special District of Shanxi Province organized repentant former heads of the Yiguandao sect and spirit mediums to confess to the masses the truth about their deception and harm to people. When this kind of education was carried out in Shanghuazhuang Village in Xin County, the deceived masses scrambled to complain and expose the crimes of Yiguandao. The village also held an exhibition of clothes, silver dollars, Dengyun shoes, silverware, and other superstitious items extorted and looted by the sect leaders. After this vivid education, all 500 Yiguandao followers who had been deceived into joining the sect withdrew from it.

    After these propaganda and education efforts, the vigilance of cadres and people in various regions against special agent activities has been greatly enhanced. Many district and village cadres in many areas have examined their complacency and begun to realize the importance of fighting against hidden special agents and counter-revolutionaries. Some farmers in Pinding, Yuci, Xin County, and other places in Shanxi Province who had mistakenly believed the rumors said: "We will not be fooled again in the future and will concentrate on production." After publicizing policies such as freedom of hiring laborers, freedom of borrowing and lending, and rewarding production in Pinding County, farmers actively repaired land, opened canals, and expanded production. The feudal secret societies used by special agents have been isolated. Masses who withdrew from Yiguandao in Fanshi, Xin County, Dingxiang, and other places said: "If the preachers come, we will definitely report them to the government."

    组织力量深入进行时事和政策宣传
    华北各地展开反谣言斗争
    公开揭发和粉碎造谣破坏阴谋，各地干部与人民群众警惕性大大提高。
    【新华社二十日讯】华北各地组织宣传力量，在人民中进行了深入的时事和政策的宣传，公开揭发了特务分子的造谣活动，粉碎了特务匪徒和反动会道门造谣惑众、扰乱人心的破坏阴谋。在粉碎反革命谣言的工作上，各地采用了各种各样的宣传教育方法。山西省很多县份，都曾为此召集了三、四百人到千余人的县、区、村干部会议，讨论朝鲜战争形势、美国侵略台湾以及特务造谣活动的特点等问题，并通过干部向人民群众进行时事教育。仅繁峙一县在开展群众性的宣传中，即举行了各种形式的座谈会、群众大会等达二百余次。该省榆次专区并以各种模型、漫画和幻灯进行宣传，帮助人民具体了解特务的造谣活动。榆次城放映的反谣言幻灯片，七天内观众达万人，附近村庄的农民都纷纷赶来观看。平原省湖西专区反革命特务分子，曾对人民政府的公粮负担和发展生产等政策进行破坏宣传。但当该区各县干部公开在农民中以实事实例说明这些政策对奖励生产的作用后，谣言就完全被戳穿了。许多农民表示：过去听见那些传言，本来就是半信半疑，这一下子可弄明白了。很多村庄的农民都逼着造谣者当众承认错误。
    各地人民政府又即时揭发了特务匪徒利用反动会门和迷信进行欺骗群众散布谣言的活动。山西省忻县专区曾组织悔过退道的一贯道头子和扶乩手，向群众坦白他们骗人害人的实情。忻县上花庄村在进行这种教育时，被骗群众争相诉苦，纷纷揭发一贯道的罪恶。该村并将道首所骗取勒索的衣服、白洋、登云鞋、银器及其他迷信品开了个展览会，被骗入道的五百名道徒经这番活生生的教育后，全部退了道。
    经过这些宣传教育后，各地干部和人民群众对特务活动的警惕性都大大提高了。不少地区的区、村干部检查了自己的太平观念，开始认识了与暗藏特务反革命分子作斗争的重要性。山西省平定、榆次、忻县等地有些误信谣言的农民表示：今后再不上当，要安心生产了。平定县宣传了雇工自由、借贷自由、奖励生产等政策后，农民们积极修地、开渠，扩大生产。被特务所利用的封建会门已被孤立起来，繁峙、忻县、定襄等地退道群众表示：如果典传师来了，一定向政府报告。
