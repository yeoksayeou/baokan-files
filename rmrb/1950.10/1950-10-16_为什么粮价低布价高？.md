Why are Grain Prices Low and Cloth Prices High?
    In the past two months, due to the large-scale marketing of autumn grain across the country and the increase in the purchasing power of the vast number of farmers, the brisk sales of various industrial products, and the significant improvement in the operating conditions of industry and commerce, prices have undergone some changes. This change is: grain prices have fallen, while industrial product prices have remained stable and slightly increased, and the exchange difference between industrial and agricultural products has expanded accordingly. Comparing the exchange ratio of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and grain, cotton in late August with late June in ten large and medium-sized cities across the country (Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Changsha, Jinan, Zhengzhou, Xi'an, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, Baoding), the average increase was from 0.9% to 16.7%. Comparing the exchange rate of yarn and grain in the four cities of Shanghai, Tianjin, Jinan, and Taiyuan in 1936 before the Anti-Japanese War with August of this year, the exchange rate of yarn and grain has expanded by 13% to 64%, and the exchange rate of cloth and grain has expanded by 43% to 73%. The problem of cheap grain and expensive cloth has become a pressing concern for the vast number of farmers.
    Why are industrial products expensive and agricultural products cheap?
    If we compare with the period before the Anti-Japanese War, we must recognize that the objective situation has undergone the following changes: (1) More than ten years of war have severely damaged the national industrial and agricultural production, with the damage to industrial production being more severe than that to agriculture. In the current process of our New Democratic economic construction, the recovery and development of agricultural production is easier than the recovery and development of industrial production. This year's bumper harvest of agricultural products will naturally have a certain impact on the fall in the price of agricultural products. (2) In order to protect the development of our national industry and prevent the competition of imported goods, for industrial products that can be produced and self-sufficient in our country, even if the cost is higher and the selling price is more expensive than imported goods, we must also promote the use of domestic products and prohibit the import of such imported goods; for industrial products that can be produced in our country but cannot currently be completely self-sufficient, we adopt a high tax import policy to increase their import costs in order to protect the development of our national industry. This is also one of the reasons why the current exchange ratio between industrial and agricultural products has expanded compared to before the Anti-Japanese War. (3) The current production cost and selling cost of many industrial products have also increased compared to before the Anti-Japanese War. Taking yarn and cloth as examples, before the Anti-Japanese War, the unified factory tax on cotton yarn accounted for about 5% of the yarn price at that time, while now our cotton yarn commodity tax has to be levied at 15% of the yarn price due to the government's financial difficulties. At present, the operating time of yarn mills and the spindle rotation rate across the country are generally lower than before the war; in addition, the current long-distance cotton transfer (such as transferring cotton from Xi'an and Linqing to supply Shanghai) also has a certain impact on the increase in the production cost of yarn and cloth. These factors have increased the price of each piece of cloth by about 50 jin of millet compared to before the war. (4) At present, transportation between regions is not very smooth, the old set of commercial organizations between urban and rural areas has been destroyed, and the new commercial network is still in its initial construction stage. The operation and management of many industrial productions are not reasonable, which has a certain impact on the expansion of the current exchange ratio between industrial and agricultural products.
    The above are the main reasons why the price difference between industrial and agricultural products is greater than before the Anti-Japanese War. In recent months, the price difference between industrial and agricultural products has expanded slightly. This is because: on the one hand, agricultural products are on the market in large quantities, the peak season for sales of industrial products has arrived, and the import volume of certain industrial equipment imported from foreign countries has recently decreased. Therefore, the prices of grain and cotton fall seasonally, and the prices of industrial products rise seasonally. This situation is in line with the objective laws of price changes. We cannot and should not completely eliminate this seasonal price fluctuation law today. On the other hand, this year's nationwide grain harvest and the large-scale marketing of autumn grain have led to a situation where the vast number of farmers are eager to sell grain in exchange for other living and production materials. Although our state-owned grain companies have stipulated relatively reasonable grain list prices, they have failed to purchase in large quantities in a timely manner, resulting in the market price of grain in many areas falling below the list price, which is detrimental to the vast number of farmers.
    Is the expansion of the exchange ratio between industrial and agricultural products a new problem this year? No. During the past twelve years of war, the exchange ratio between industrial and agricultural products has been expanding. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas and the Japanese-occupied areas during the Anti-Japanese War, the exchange ratio between industrial and agricultural products in some years was even more serious than it is now, but the Kuomintang reactionary government, the Japanese imperialists and their puppet Wang Jingwei's puppet government did not care about these issues at all. Now the people's democratic government is the opposite of them and cares about the interests of the people, so the phenomenon of the expansion of the exchange price difference between industrial and agricultural products that has occurred in the past two months has aroused the serious attention of governments at all levels, and they have begun to take various effective measures to change this situation. In his report "Striving to Consolidate and Develop the Victory of the People" at the cadre meeting celebrating National Day, Premier Zhou clearly pointed out: "Recently, due to the bumper harvest in summer and autumn and the reduction in certain materials imported from abroad, the price difference between agricultural and industrial products has increased somewhat. The Central People's Government is trying to adjust this in order to prevent the lives of farmers and some wage earners who calculate their wages in grain from being affected."
    How to adjust the current exchange ratio between industrial products and agricultural products? Governments at all levels are currently taking the following two measures:
    The first is to vigorously stabilize grain prices and raise market prices to near list prices. To this end, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government has instructed trade agencies at all levels to purchase grain in large quantities and quickly change the unreasonable situation where the market price of grain is far lower than the list price in order to prevent low grain prices from hurting farmers. As a result of the implementation of this measure, grain prices in various regions have not only stopped falling in the past half month, but market prices have begun to rise, and list prices and market prices have gradually approached. Comparing the market prices of grain in ten large and medium-sized cities (same as above) on October 5th with August 30th, they have now risen by an average of 15.4%. This is an effective measure to adjust the current exchange ratio between industrial and agricultural products.
    The second is to stabilize the prices of yarn and cloth and make appropriate adjustments under the principle of ensuring certain profits for yarn and cloth producers and distributors. This measure has also been put into practice. For example, comparing the price changes of white cloth in ten large and medium-sized cities (same as above) on October 5th with August 31st, each piece has now been reduced by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan.
    Of course, to continue to narrow the scissors difference in the exchange of industrial and agricultural products, the basic key lies in: fully improving the productivity of various industries, increasing the production volume of industrial products, and improving the operation and management of industries in order to achieve the purpose of reducing the production cost of industrial products. But this cannot be achieved overnight. At present, appropriately increasing grain prices (first aiming to reach the list price), stabilizing and appropriately adjusting the prices of yarn and cloth are practical and effective measures to adjust the current exchange ratio of major industrial and agricultural products. As a result of the initial implementation of this measure, it has been welcomed by the vast number of farmers. The exchange difference between some industrial and agricultural products has begun to narrow. Calculating the exchange ratio of grain and cloth (market price) in the six inland large and medium-sized cities of Hankou, Changsha, Jinan, Shijiazhuang, Xi'an, and Taiyuan on October 5th and August 31st, it has now narrowed by an average of 16.8%. See the table below:
    Comparison Table of Changes in the Amount of Grain Exchanged for Each Piece of Cloth in Six Inland Cities on October 5th and August 31st:
    	Hankou	Changsha	Jinan	Shijiazhuang	Xi'an	Taiyuan
    August 31st	324	379	355	379	385	330
    October 5th	292	348	293	262	309	282
    Percentage Reduction	9.8	8.3	17.4	31.0	19.8	14.4
    Note: (1) The exchange amount is in jin; (2) The cloth is 12-pound white cloth; (3) Grain: Hankou and Changsha are rice, Xi'an is wheat, and others are millet.
    From the changes in the cloth and grain exchange ratio on October 5th and August 31st listed in the above table, it can be seen that the difference in their exchange ratio has begun to narrow. Of course, since the current various subjective and objective conditions are not exactly the same as before the Anti-Japanese War, it is still impossible to restore today's exchange ratio between industrial and agricultural products to the pre-war standard all at once. We must explain this clearly to the vast number of farmers. But we can believe that after the government reasonably grasps the prices of industrial and agricultural products, vigorously develops industrial production, and gradually reduces the production cost of industrial products, the exchange ratio between industrial and agricultural products will gradually narrow in the future, which is undoubtedly. This is also one of the important symbols that distinguishes our New Democratic economic system from the old Chinese economic system.

### 为什么粮价低布价高？

　　为什么粮价低布价高？
    近两月来由于全国各地秋粮的大量上市，广大农民购买力的开始提高，各种工业品的畅销，工商业经营情况的显著好转，使物价发生了一些变化。这种变化，就是：粮价下落，工业品价格则表现稳定且略有上升，工业品与农产品的交换差额随之扩大。以全国十个大、中城市（上海、天津、汉口、长沙、济南、郑州、西安、太原、石家庄、保定）八月底与六月底棉纱、棉布与粮食、棉花的交换比价比较，平均扩大了百分之○·九到百分之一六·七。以沪、津、济南、太原四城市抗战前一九三六年与今年八月份比较，纱与粮的交换率则扩大了百分之十三至六十四，布与粮的交换率扩大了百分之四十三至七十三。粮贱布贵的问题，已经成为目前广大农民所迫切关心的问题。
    为什么工业品贵了，农业品便宜了呢？
    如果与抗战前比较，我们必须认识客观情况已有下列变化：（１）十余年的战争，使全国的工农业生产事业均受到了严重的破坏，其中工业生产所遭到的破坏又较农业为重。在目前我们新民主主义经济建设的过程中，农业生产的恢复与发展较之工业生产的恢复与发展比较容易。今年农产丰收，对于农产品价格的跌落自然亦有一定的影响。（２）为着保护本国民族工业的发展，防止舶来品的竞争，凡本国可以出产并能自给的工业品，虽较舶来品成本高，售价贵，但我们也必须提倡使用本国产品，禁止该项舶来品的进口；凡本国可以出产但目前尚不能完全自给的工业品，我们则采取高税进口的政策，提高其进口成本，以保护本国工业的发展。这也是目前工农业品交换比价较之抗战前扩大的原因之一。（３）有许多工业品目前的生产成本与出售成本，亦较抗战前增加了。以纱、布为例，抗战前棉纱的出厂统税，约合当时纱价的百分之五左右，而现在我们的棉纱货物税，则由于政府财政困难，而不得不按纱价的百分之十五征收。目前全国纱厂的开工时间及纱锭运转率，一般亦皆较战前降低了；此外目前长距离的棉花调运（如调西安、临清的棉花供应上海之用），对纱、布生产成本的增高，亦有一定的影响。这些因素使平均每一匹布的价格上，即较战前增加约五十斤小米左右。（４）目前各地区之间交通尚不十分畅通，城乡之间旧的一套商业组织已被破坏，新的商业网尚在初建，许多工业生产的经营管理尚不合理，这对目前工农业品交换比例的扩大，亦有一定的影响。
    以上是目前工农业品价格差异较抗战前扩大的主要原因。近几月来，工农业品价格差异又扩大了些。这是由于：一方面是农产品大量上市，工业品的畅销季节到来，加以某些由国外进口的工业器材近来进口量减少，因之粮、棉价格季节性地下落，工业品价格季节性地上升。这种情形是符合物价变化的客观规律的。这种季节性的物价涨落规律，今天我们不可能亦不应该完全消除。另方面，今年全国各地粮食丰收，秋粮大量上市后，因广大农民急于售粮换购其他生活及生产资料，我国营粮食公司虽规定有较为合理的粮食牌价，但因未能及时大量收购，以致许多地区粮食市价落到牌价以下，这对广大农民是不利的。
    工农业品交换比价的扩大，是否是今年新出现的问题呢？不是的。过去十二年的战争当中，工农业品的交换比价是一直在扩大着，在抗日战争时期的蒋管区及日寇统治区，有些年份工农业品交换比价，比目前更为严重，但国民党反动政府也罢，日本帝国主义及其傀儡汪精卫伪政府也罢，是根本不关心这些问题的。现在人民民主政府与他们相反，是关心人民利益的，所以近两个月来所发生的工农业品交换差价的扩大的现象，已引起各地政府的严重注意，并已开始采取各种有效办法在改变这一状况。周总理在庆祝国庆节的干部大会上“为巩固和发展人民的胜利而奋斗”的报告中，已明确指出：“最近因为夏秋季的丰收，和由外国入口的某些物资的减少，农产品和工业品的差价有些增大，中央人民政府正在设法调节，以免农民及一部分以粮食计算的工资生活者的生活受到影响”。
    如何调节目前工业品与农产品的交换比价呢？各地政府现正采取下列两方面的措施：
    首先是大力稳住粮价，提高市价到接近牌价。为此，中央人民政府贸易部已指示各地贸易机关，大量收购粮食，迅速改变粮食市价远低于牌价的不合理状况，以防谷贱伤农。这一措施执行的结果，近半月来各地粮价不但已停止下跌，而且市价已开始回升，牌价与市价已逐渐接近。以十月五日与八月三十日十个大中城市（同上）的粮食市价比较，现已平均回升了百分之十五·四。这对调整目前工农业品的交换比价，是一有效的措施。
    其次是稳住纱、布价格，并在保证纱、布生产者及运销者的一定利润的原则下，予以适当的调整。这一措施也已见诸实行。如十月五日与八月三十一日十个大中城市（同上）白细布的价格变化比较，每匹现已降低了五千元到一万元。
    当然，要继续缩小工业品与农产品交换中的剪刀差额，其基本关键还在于：充分提高各种工业的生产力，增加工业品的生产量，并改善工业的经营管理，以达减低工业品生产成本的目的。但这不是一朝一夕所能奏效的。在目前来讲，适当的提高粮价（首先以达牌价为准），稳住并适当的调整纱、布的价格，则是调整当前主要工农业品交换比价的切合实际的有效措施。此项措施开始执行的结果，已得到广大农民的欢迎。部分工农业品的交换差价，已开始缩小。以汉口、长沙、济南、石家庄、西安、太原六个内地大、中城市十月五日与八月三十一日的粮、布交换比例计算（市价），现已平均缩小了百分之一六·八。试看下表：
    六个内地城市十月五日与八月三十一日每匹布换粮量变化比较表：
    汉口  长沙  济南  石家庄  西安  太原
    八月卅一日  三二四  三七九  三五五  三七九  三八五  三三○
    十月五日  二九二  三四八  二九三  二六二  三○九  二八二
    减少百分比  九·八  八·三  一七·四  三一·○  一九·八  一四·四
    注：（１）交换量为市斤；（２）布为十二磅白细布；（３）粮食：汉口、长沙为大米，西安为小麦，其他为小米。
    从上表所列各地十月五日与八月三十一日布、粮交换比例的变化中，可以看出其交换比价的差额，已在开始缩小。当然，由于目前与抗战前的各种主客观条件并不完全一样，要想使今天的工农业品交换比价，一下子恢复到战前的标准，则还是不可能的。此点我们必须向广大农民解释清楚。但我们可以相信：经过政府合理的掌握工农业品的价格，大力发展工业生产及逐渐减低工业品的生产成本，今后工农业品的交换比价将会逐渐缩小，则是毫无疑义的。这也正是我新民主主义经济制度区别于旧中国经济制度的重要标志之一。
