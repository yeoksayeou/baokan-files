　　Cang County Public Security Bureau Inspects Work
    Overcomes the Tendency of Being "Boundlessly Lenient"
    [This newspaper reported] The Cang County People's Public Security Bureau of Hebei Province, during a recent social investigation, discovered that the Cang County People's Government had failed to severely suppress counter-revolutionaries, manifested in the untimely and excessively lenient handling of heinous bandit and special agent cases. The bureau has conducted a thorough self-criticism.
    Since Cang County was transferred from Shandong Province to Hebei Province in 1948, for two years until this spring, not a single major bandit criminal with heinous crimes had been executed. During this period, the case that the masses were most dissatisfied with was the arrest at the end of 1948 of Zhu Guangqing (also known as Zhu Si, the head of the assassination team), an important bandit who had killed eighteen people. After more than a year of trials, the Cang County government delayed making a decision. The masses discussed it, saying that the government should not be lenient towards Zhu Si. Bad people took the opportunity to become rampant, saying, "The government is lenient even to people like Zhu Si! What's the big deal with making a small mistake!" This situation only improved somewhat after the criminal was executed at a mass rally in March of this year. Another example is Gao Desheng, a murderer captured last May. The county's Public Security Bureau interrogated him for more than three months, and then filed a lawsuit with the court in August of last year. It was not until October 10th of this year that a request for sentencing was submitted to the Legal Committee, delaying the case for more than a year.
    Secondly, in the process of suppressing counter-revolutionary activities, a tendency of "boundless leniency" was manifested, which further condoned the rampant activities of bad elements. For example, Li Hongzhi, a traitor and special agent of Qianying Village who defected to the enemy with his gun three times, was sent to Shijiazhuang for training after the liberation of Tianjin, and was released home after only a short period of time. However, the criminal remained incorrigible and continued to do evil.
    In addition, the county's Public Security Bureau lacked correct mastery of the policy of combining leniency and suppression. There was no distinction between good and bad, and those who were controlled were treated the same whether they were the ringleaders or the coerced. Those who could be won over and reformed were not reformed well. For example, Han Zhiping of Yaoguantun in the county had been a traitor in the past and returned home after the liberation of Tianjin. No reactionary facts were found, but he was arrested for playing money twice and has been under control from last spring until now. It was not until after this investigation that his control was lifted. The masses all said, "This kind of person should not have been controlled long ago."
    These shortcomings, after inspection and self-criticism by the county Public Security Bureau, have attracted close attention from the leadership. Preparations are being made to thoroughly correct them through this rectification movement, and the Central People's Government's instructions on "suppressing counter-revolutionaries" and relevant documents will be used as regular study materials, so as to correctly grasp the policy of "the ringleaders must be dealt with, the coerced are not questioned, and those who perform meritorious service are rewarded."

　　沧县人民公安局检查工作
    克服“宽大无边”的偏向
    【本报讯】河北沧县人民政府公安局，最近在进行社会调查中，发现沧县人民政府对反革命分子未能予以严厉镇压，表现在对处理罪大恶极的匪特案件不及时和过份宽大。该局已作深入检讨。
    沧县自一九四八年由山东划归河北省管辖以来，至今春共二年时间，对罪大恶极重要匪犯，从未杀过一人。在这期间，群众对政府最不满意的一个案子，就是在一九四八年末捉住曾杀害十八条人命的重要匪犯朱广庆（又叫朱四敌暗杀团队长），前后审判经过了一年多时间，沧县政府拖延不决，群众纷纷议论，政府不应把朱四宽大。坏人更趁机猖獗，说：“凭朱四这样的人政府还宽大呢！犯点小错误有什么要紧！”直至今年三月开群众大会枪毙该犯后，这种情况才有些好转。又如去年五月捕获杀人凶犯高德胜，该县公安局侦讯了三个多月，至去年八月间起诉到法院，直至今年十月十日才在法律委员会提出呈请判刑，把案件拖了一年多。
    其次，在进行镇压反革命分子活动过程中，表现了“宽大无边”的偏向，更纵容了坏分子的嚣张活动。如前营村三次拐枪投敌的汉奸特务分子李洪智，在天津解放后，被送至石家庄管训，只经过很短时间后即释放回家。但该犯仍怙恶不悛，继续作恶。
    另外，该县公安局在执行宽大与镇压相结合的政策上，也缺乏正确掌握对好坏不分，首恶的与胁从的一样管制，可以争取改造的未很好改造。如该县姚官屯韩志平，在过去当过汉奸，天津解放后回家，并未发现有何反动事实，只因玩了两次钱被捕，由去年春天一直管制到现在。直到这次调查之后，才取消了对他的管制，群众都说：“这样的人早就不应该管制了。”
    这些缺点，经过该县公安局检查与检讨已引起领导上的严密注意，准备通过这次整风运动，切实予以纠正，并将中央人民政府“镇压反革命分子”的指示和有关文件作为经常学习资料，使能正确掌握“首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖”的政策。
