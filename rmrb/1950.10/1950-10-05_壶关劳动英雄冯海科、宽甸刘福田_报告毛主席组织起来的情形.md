　　Huguan Labor Hero Feng Haike, Kuandian Liu Futian
    Report to Chairman Mao on the Situation of Organizing
    [Our Newspaper] Feng Haike, a labor hero from Cuigu Village, Guojiajie, Huguan County, Shanxi Province, and Liu Futian, of the mutual aid group of Shimiaozi Village, Taipingshao District, Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, wrote to Chairman Mao, reporting on the production achievements after the formation of the mutual aid group. Both letters used facts to prove the principle of organizing diligent production and improving life. The original letters are excerpted as follows:
  In a letter to Chairman Mao, Feng Haike, a labor hero from Cuigu Village, Guojiajie, Huguan County, said: Dear Chairman Mao:
    I am from Cuigu Village, Guojiajie, Sixth District, Huguan. Our village is a remote village in Huguan County, with many mountains and little land. The lives of the masses have always been very difficult. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, all nine households in the village were tenant farmers, renting 60 mu of land from landlords and paying 28 shi of rent annually. Under the harsh exploitation of the landlords, four households starved every spring and went out to make a living; five households ate chaff and wild vegetables. Seeing that their families were about to be ruined and their land deserted, all 43 people in the village were about to be displaced. Fortunately, in the summer of 1942, the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, under your leadership, came to liberate us. After the land reform, we recovered the land and bought another 12 mu of land. Together with the 19.8 mu left by our ancestors, the whole village had a total of 111.8 mu of land. Since then, we have started to carry out production happily on our own land; our lives have been getting better day by day, and the poor state of hunger and cold has never returned.
    You clearly pointed out to us the road to "organize," work diligently in production, and live a good life. We listened to you. In the spring of 1945, all nine households in the village voluntarily organized a mutual aid group, which has not collapsed until now; on the contrary, it has become more consolidated day by day, the production technology has also been improved, and the output has been increasing year by year. In 1945, the average yield per mu was 7 dou and 8 sheng; last year, the average yield per mu reached 1 shi, 4 dou, and 5 he, exceeding the yield of 1945 by 6 dou, 2 sheng, and 5 he, an increase of more than double compared with before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Last year, 111.8 mu of land produced a total of 69 shi, 8 dou, 7 sheng, and 4 he more. We also bought three cows and added many new farm tools.

　　壶关劳动英雄冯海科、宽甸刘福田
    报告毛主席组织起来的情形
    【本报讯】山西省壶关县郭家碣翠谷村劳动英雄冯海科、辽东省宽甸县太平哨区石庙子村刘福田互助组分别上书毛主席，报告互助组组成后的生产成绩。两信均以事实证明了组织起来勤劳生产，改善生活的道理。特将原信摘要如后：
  壶关县郭家碣翠谷村劳动英雄冯海科给毛主席的信中说：亲爱的毛主席：
    我是壶关六区郭家碣翠谷村人。我村是壶关县一个偏僻的村庄，山多地少，从来群众生活就很困难。全庄九户，抗战前都是佃户，租种着地主的六十亩地，每年交租大斗二十八石。在地主的苛刻剥削下，有四户一到春天就饿着肚皮，出外谋生；有五户吃糠咽菜。眼看家破地荒，全村四十三口人将要流离失散了，幸亏于一九四二年夏天，在你领导下的共产党、八路军来解放了我们。经过了土改时我们收回来了土地，又买了十二亩地，连我们祖宗遗留下的十九亩八分，全村共有一百一十一亩八分地。从此，我们开始在自己的土地上兴高采烈地进行生产；生活一天天好起来，饥寒交迫的穷困状态已一去不复返了。
    您明确地给我们指出：“组织起来”，勤劳生产，过好光景的道路。我们听从了您的话，一九四五年春，全庄九户自觉自愿地组织了一个互助组，一直到现在没有垮过台；相反的，一天比一天更巩固了，生产技术也提高了，产量也在逐年增加着。一九四五年每亩平均产量七斗八升；去年每亩平均产量达一石四斗零五合，超过一九四五年产量六斗二升五合，较抗战前增加了一倍以上。去年一百一十一亩八分地，共增产六十九石八斗七升四合。还买了三头牛，增添了许多新农具。
