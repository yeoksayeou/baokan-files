　　Cuban Youth's Determined Will to Fight for National Independence
　　——An Interview with Cuban Representative Bravo
　　The day after the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation arrived in Beijing, a reporter interviewed Comrade Bravo, the Cuban youth representative from the West Indies in Latin America.

　　Because Cuba is adjacent to the United States, this small country with a population of only five million has always been under the rule of American imperialism. The Cuban reactionary government has sold out the entire country, and the lives of the people are becoming increasingly impoverished. Whether in military, political, or economic matters, the actual leader is the American embassy in Cuba. The Cuban reactionary government is nothing more than a decorative object.

　　However, the Cuban people and youth are not silent. They have continuously risen up to fight against the reactionary government and the American aggressors for the independence and freedom of their motherland. In order to continue their sinful rule and to please the American imperialists, the reactionary government has exerted extreme pressure on the domestic democratic movement, using despicable and shameless means to assassinate the leaders of various trade unions. In the past two or three years, twenty or thirty people have been assassinated. Cuban youth, like a prairie fire, have launched a movement against imperialism and the government's policy of national betrayal, fighting for peace, defending national independence, and protecting the basic rights of youth.

　　The youth have organized the "National Youth Committee for the Defense of Peace," which includes working-class and peasant youth and intellectuals of different religions, political beliefs, and skin colors.

　　Recently, the reactionary government, seeing the growing strength of the domestic democratic movement, used bandit-like methods to remove the printing presses of the Communist Party's newspaper, *Hoy*. At the same time, it declared the democratic movement illegal, dispatched large numbers of special agents to infiltrate various trade unions to sabotage the labor movement, and occupied the Communist Party's radio station.

　　In order to suppress the people of the whole country, the reactionary government has specially organized a special forces army completely trained by American imperialism, using all kinds of cruel punishments to deal with domestic youth groups.

　　Because the domestic factories and mines have been sold to American imperialism, the domestic economy is facing a crisis. Factories are closing down, and young workers are losing their jobs. In order to oppose the government's policy of national betrayal, strikes and class boycotts are constantly rising, and the peace movement is growing stronger. According to statistics on August 20, 530,000 people nationwide have signed, including 110,000 young people. They have also made the greatest efforts in publicizing support for the just struggle of the Korean people. Meetings are often held to spread propaganda in workshops, classrooms, and streets, even in every corner. The slogan "We will never follow the American executioners" is everywhere. The Socialist Youth League also distributed 100,000 leaflets entitled "Never Be Executioners Who Massacre the People of Asia." The walls of the streets are painted with large slogans: "Demand that American imperialism withdraw from Korea!" "Cuban youth will never be cannon fodder for American imperialism!" For these reasons, many young people have been arrested, even children as young as eight or ten years old.

　　Finally, Bravo said solemnly: "The Cuban youth and people will certainly continue their struggle for peace and national independence forever. The Cuban youth and people will never fight against the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, nor will they ever fight against the people of Asia and the people of China!"

　　The victory of the Chinese people has brought the Cuban people confidence in victory. The Cuban people and youth are determined to fight to the end for true democratic independence!

　　古巴青年争取祖国独立的坚决意志
    ——访问古巴代表布拉伏
    世界民主青年联盟代表团来到北京的翌日，记者访问了来自拉丁美洲西印度群岛的古巴青年代表布拉伏同志。
    因为古巴毗连着美国，这个全国人口只有五百万的小国，从来就受着美帝的统治。古巴反动政府出卖了整个的国家，全国人民的生活日益贫困，不论军事、政治、经济，实际上的主持人都是美国驻古巴的大使馆，古巴反动政府倒不过是一个摆设品而已。
    但是，古巴的人民和青年是并不沉默的，他们为了祖国的独立、自由，不断地起来和反动政府与美国侵略者作斗争。反动政府为了要延续他们的罪恶统治并为讨好美帝起见，对国内的民主运动极力地加以压力，用卑劣无耻的手段，暗杀各业工会的负责人，在近两、三年里，被暗杀的已有二三十人。而古巴青年也像燎原的野火似的展开了反帝、反对卖国政府投降政策的运动，为争取和平、保卫民族独立和青年的基本权利而进行斗争。
    青年们组织了“全国青年保卫和平委员会”，在这个组织里包括了不同宗教、不同政治信仰与不同肤色的工农劳动青年和知识分子。
    最近，反动政府目睹国内民主运动日益壮大，于是用强盗式的手段搬走了共产党机关报《今天》的印刷机器。同时他又宣布民主运动为非法。派遣大批特务渗入各工会阴谋破坏工运，并占据了共产党的电台。
    反动政府为了要镇压全国人民，特别组织了一支完全受过美帝训练的特务军队，以各式各样的残酷刑罚对付国内的青年群。
    由于国内的工厂、矿山都出卖给了美帝，国内的经济已面临危机。工厂倒闭、青年工人失业。为了反对政府这样的卖国政策，罢工罢课的斗争正不断地高涨着，同时和平运动更日见壮大。据八月二十日的统计，全国签名的已有五十三万人，其中有十一万是青年。在支援朝鲜人民正义斗争的宣传上，也尽了最大的力量，在车间、课室和街道上，甚至在每一个角落里，经常是在开会宣传。“我们绝不跟美国刽子手走”的标语到处可见。社会主义青年团也散发了十万份“永远不做屠杀亚洲人民的刽子手”的传单，街衢的墙壁上到处油漆着：“要求美帝退出朝鲜！”“古巴青年绝对不当美帝的炮灰！”的大字标语。为了这些，许多的青年被捕了，连八岁十岁的小孩子也不能幸免。
    最后，布拉伏严肃地说：“古巴青年和人民一定永远的继续他们争取和平和民族独立的斗争，古巴青年和人民永远不会对苏联和各新民主主义国家作战，也永远不会向亚洲人民和中国人民作战！”
    中国人民的胜利带给了古巴人民胜利的信心，古巴人民和青年决心为真正民主独立而斗争到底！
