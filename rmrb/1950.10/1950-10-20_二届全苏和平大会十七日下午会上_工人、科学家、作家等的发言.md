Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 18th: The Second All-Soviet Peace Congress continued its discussion on the report given by Nikolai Tikhonov, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee, on the afternoon of the 17th. Workers, scientists, writers, prominent social figures, and representatives of the church all spoke about the unified desire of the Soviet people for peace and international friendship, and about the peaceful and constructive labor of the Soviet people.

　　Musdukova, a female worker from the Leningrad Shoe Factory
　　Musdukova, a female worker from the Skoroход Shoe Factory in Leningrad, said: There are various ways to fight for peace. Writers fight for peace with fiery and enthusiastic words, collective farm peasants fight for peace with good harvests, and Soviet workers strengthen peace with their labor. All the staff of the Skoroход Shoe Factory want me to convey to the Congress that they will continue to fight for peace with Stakhanovite labor. We Leningraders, together with all peace-loving countries in the world, protest against the American aggression against Korea. We demand: No intervention in Korea! No intervention in Vietnam! No intervention in Taiwan!

　　Nikolai, Metropolitan of Krutitsy
　　Nikolai, Metropolitan of Krutitsy, representing the Russian Orthodox Church, continued by saying: The Russian Orthodox Church was and remains at the forefront of the fighters for peace, the fighters for the lasting peace desired by all people in the world. The Russian Orthodox Church has more than once expressed its attitude towards peace and war, towards the madness and sinful war instigators, and towards the ugly role of the Vatican directly before the world and Soviet public.

　　Nikolai continued: We, the Russian Orthodox believers and clergy, as citizens of this great peace-loving motherland - the banner of world peace, deeply feel with the people of the whole country, longing to stop the war we hate, and unite all peace-loving mankind to accomplish this goal, in order to punish the madmen and criminals who instigate new wars. All the clergy and believers of the Russian Orthodox Church have signed the peace declaration. All honest people in the world must protest against war propaganda, against the war hysteria that a small group of bloodthirsty American and British merchants are creating and carrying out, who want to warm their devilish hands with the flames of a new war. The Russian Orthodox Church protests with deep satisfaction against sinful and bloody war propaganda. The Russian Orthodox Church unanimously supports Stalin's peaceful foreign policy, considering it an invaluable contribution to the cause of strengthening peace, and a symbol of the eternal prosperity of our great motherland. This policy was expressed in the recent declaration of the Soviet delegation at the United Nations General Assembly, and the Russian Orthodox Church is fighting side by side with our people, with the people led by the genius leader of mankind - the great Stalin.

　　Composer Khrennikov
　　Composer Khrennikov spoke about the international situation, saying that the American and British imperialists are increasingly actively pursuing their aggressive policies in Europe. They are using the Atlantic Pact to make European countries serve the American war plans. Recently, their activities have turned to completely remilitarizing West Germany, dragging West Germany into the aggressive Atlantic group, and making it a springboard for future wars against peace-loving European countries. The remilitarization of West Germany poses a serious threat to peace. Peace-loving countries must thwart the criminal plans of the American and British imperialists in Europe.

　　Soviet Famous Writer Vasilevska
　　Soviet famous writer Wanda Vasilevska said in her speech: The duty of every citizen of the Soviet Union is to fight for peace, to prevent the terrible danger from threatening mankind again. We appeal to all those in the world who have deeply felt the pain of enslavement and tasted the taste of being slaves of imperialists. We call on the people of France - the people with great revolutionary traditions, the people with the traditions of the Paris Commune, we call on the people of Thorez to fight for peace more resolutely than before. We call on the people of Italy, the people of Garibaldi, to fight for peace more resolutely than before. We call on the people of Asia, we call on the people of Africa to fight for peace! We appeal to the American people: Fight for peace! We call on those American mothers whose children are dying shamefully in Korea: For the lives of your children and the lives of Korean children, fight for peace!

　　Soviet Film Director Aleksandrov
　　Soviet People's Artist, one of the outstanding Soviet film directors, Aleksandrov, in his speech, specifically discussed the role of Soviet film workers in the struggle for peace. He said: Soviet film workers have put forward all their creativity, all their labor to fight for the realization of the great communist ideas, for the bright future of their motherland, and for the peaceful friendship of all countries.

　　Aleksandrov emphasized: While this conference is being held, a bloody and barbaric war is being waged in Korea. However, the imperialists are not satisfied with their greed, and they are also instigating war in Vietnam. They are also preparing for war in the West, in the heart of Europe. Everyone knows that the result of the New York meeting of foreign ministers of Western countries on September 19, 1950 was that West Germany and West Berlin must be fully remilitarized and included in the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty, making them a strategic base for launching attacks against the German Democratic Republic, against the people's democratic countries, and against the Soviet Union. According to these criminal plans, the British and American imperialists are increasing their troops stationed in West Germany and establishing German mercenary troops, so that they can use them as cannon fodder when committing crimes against freedom-loving mankind. This is the policy that the imperialist countries hope to use to pave the way for war against the people of European countries. We must never allow this vile plan to be put into practice.

　　Popova, Chairman of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee
　　Popova, Chairman of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, said: Soviet women unanimously agree with and support the peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet government. They warmly support all the measures taken by the Soviet government to consolidate peace and security, and they firmly advocate the prohibition of atomic weapons and the reduction of armaments. We have seen how desperately the rulers of the United States, Britain, and France are expanding their aggressive plans in Europe. They deliberately turned Western Europe into a strategic base for their war against the people of European democratic countries. In order to achieve this goal, they increased the number and armament of their troops stationed in Germany, they established mercenary troops in West Germany, restored West Germany's war industry, and at the same time reduced peacetime production. Peace-loving countries cannot ignore this criminal plan of the imperialists. The people of all countries in the world must expose and defeat this criminal plan of the American, British, and French imperialists. Popova described the women's movement to defend peace in various capitalist countries. In the struggle for peace, the will of women is becoming more and more determined, their political awareness is also increasing, and a strong determination to defend peace has been formed. Popova called on women from the United States, Britain, Italy, France, Sweden, Finland, and women from all over the world to fight more bravely and more resolutely for peace.

　　Crowther, Chairman of the British Peace Committee
　　Crowther, Chairman of the British Peace Committee and representative of the World Peace Congress Standing Committee, spoke after Popova: Mr. Chairman, dear Soviet friends: I would like to express my warmest respect to the Soviet people, to the more than 115 million Soviet men and women who have signed the peace declaration, on behalf of the World Peace Congress Standing Committee, on behalf of all peace-loving people. We sincerely thank them for their great efforts in the struggle for peace. We know that with their help, we will win the victory in the struggle against war and we will win the victory in the battle for peace.

　　Crowther continued: The construction work in Moscow moved him deeply. Where the construction project of Moscow University had just begun a year ago, huge buildings are now being built. Isn't this an answer to the question of how the Soviet people view peace and war? And what is MacArthur up to? Who is the aggressor - are they the people who are building universities, or the people who are throwing bombs on Korean cities?

　　Crowther talked about the preparations in Britain for the Second World Peace Congress, saying: We are happily waiting for the arrival of the Soviet delegation, the leading representatives of the Soviet working class, peasants, and intellectuals. We know that they are the representatives of the great Soviet country, which, under the guidance of Stalin, the architect of genius and peace, leads mankind into the century of socialism, peace, and progress.

　　After that, the speakers were Tajik writer Sad, old Russian actress Yablochkina, Archbishop Turs of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia, and famous Soviet combine harvester driver Bolin. Thirty-eight people have already spoken in the discussion of Tikhonov's report.

　　At the afternoon meeting, the report of the Chairman of the Credentials Committee, Yershova, was heard. He announced the composition of the delegates to the Second All-Soviet Peace Congress.

　　One thousand one hundred and seventy-two delegates, representing two hundred million peace-loving Soviet people, were elected to attend the conference. The Soviet people, in sending delegates to the conference, once again expressed their unanimous support for Stalin's foreign policy - the policy of peace and international friendship. The Second All-Soviet Peace Congress represents all strata of Soviet society. Among the attendees are 210 representatives of the working class and 157 representatives of collective farmers. The Soviet intelligentsia is also widely represented. There are 230 engineers, 84 teachers, and 31 doctors among the delegates. The representatives of Soviet scientists attending the meeting include 105 academicians and corresponding academicians of the Academy of Sciences, and 88 doctors and masters of science. Among the representatives are famous writers, poets, composers, artists, film directors, as well as clergy and representatives of various religious faiths. Representatives of the forty nationalities within the Soviet Union also attended.

　　On the 17th, the conference elected a committee responsible for appointing delegates to attend the Second World Peace Congress.

　　The audience warmly welcomed Bauerison, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, who was present. The conference will continue on the 18th.

　　二届全苏和平大会十七日下午会上
    工人、科学家、作家等的发言
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十八日电：第二届全苏拥护和平大会于十七日下午继续讨论苏联拥护和平委员会主席吉洪诺夫所作的报告。工人、科学家、作家、知名的社会人物、教会代表等都谈到苏联人民热望和平与国际友好的一致愿望，谈到苏联人民和平的建设性劳动。
    列宁格勒制鞋厂女工穆斯杜克娃
    列宁格勒斯克罗豪德制鞋厂的女工人穆斯杜克娃说：争取和平的斗争是有各种各样的办法的。作家以火一般热烈的言语争取和平，集体农场的农民以丰收争取和平，苏联工人以他们的劳动加强和平。斯克罗豪德制鞋厂的全体人员要我转告大会，他们要继续以斯塔哈诺夫式的劳动为和平而斗争。我们列宁格勒人与世界一切爱好和平的国家一道抗议美国对朝鲜的侵略行为。我们要求：不要干涉朝鲜！不要干涉越南！不要干涉台湾！
    克鲁提齐大主教尼古拉
    克鲁提齐大主教尼古拉代表俄罗斯正教教会继起发言称：俄罗斯正教教会过去是而且现在仍是站在和平斗士、站在争取全世界人民所热望的持久和平的斗士们的前列的。俄罗斯正教教会曾不止一次地直接在世界和苏联公众面前表示其对于和平和战争的态度、对于疯狂和罪恶的战争挑拨者的态度以及对于梵蒂冈的丑恶角色的态度。
    尼古拉继称：我们这些俄罗斯正教信徒和教士们，作为这个伟大的爱好和平的祖国——世界和平的旗手的公民，与全国人民深具同感，渴望着制止我们所痛恨的战争，并且团结一切爱好和平的人类完成这一目的，以便惩罚煽动新战争的疯子和罪犯。俄罗斯正教的全体教士和信徒们都已在和平宣言上签了名。全世界的正直人民必须抗议战争宣传，抗议一小撮嗜杀成性的美国和英国的商人正在制造和进行的战争歇斯底里，他们要以新战争的烽火来温暖他们的魔手。俄罗斯正教教会以深深满意的心情同声抗议罪恶血腥的战争宣传。俄罗斯正教教会全体一致地支持斯大林的和平外交政策，认为它对于加强和平的事业是一个无法估计的贡献，认为它是我们伟大祖国的永远繁昌的象征，这个政策最近苏联代表团在联合国大会中发表的宣言中表示出来了，而且俄罗斯正教教会正在与我国人民、与人类天才的领袖——伟大的斯大林所领导的人民并肩进行斗争。
    作曲家赫连尼科夫
    作曲家赫连尼科夫谈到国际局势称，美英帝国主义者们正愈来愈积极地在欧洲进行其侵略政策。他们经由大西洋公约来使欧洲各国为美国的战争计划服务。最近他们的活动又转向于使西德彻底重新军事化，将西德拖入侵略性的大西洋集团，并且使它成为将来对爱好和平的欧洲各国作战的跳板。西德的重新军国主义化造成了对和平的严重威胁。爱好和平的国家必须挫败美英帝国主义者们在欧洲的罪恶计划。
    苏联名作家华西列夫斯卡
    苏联名作家万达·华西列夫斯卡演说称：苏联每一个公民的职责是为和平而斗争，以防止可怕的危险再度威胁人类。我们向全世界那些已经深感悲痛的奴役生活和尝过作帝国主义者的奴隶的滋味的人们呼吁。我们号召法国的人民——具有伟大革命传统的人民、具有巴黎公社传统的人民，我们号召多列士的人民比从前更加坚决地为和平而战斗。我们号召意大利的人民、加里波地的人民比从前更加坚决地为和平而战斗。我们号召亚洲的人民，我们号召非洲的人民为和平而战斗！我们向美国人民呼吁：为和平而战斗！我们号召那些她们的孩子正在朝鲜可耻地死去的美国母亲们：为了你们的孩子与朝鲜孩子的性命，为和平而战斗罢！
    苏联电影导演亚历山德罗夫
    苏联的人民艺术家、苏联的优秀电影导演之一亚历山德罗夫在演说中专门论述苏联电影工作者在和平斗争中所起的作用。他说：苏联电影工作者拿出了他们的全部创造力、他们的一切劳动来为伟大的共产主义思想的实现、为他们祖国的光辉未来、为各国的和平友好而斗争。
    亚历山德罗夫强调指出：在举行这个大会的同时，血腥野蛮的战争正在朝鲜进行着。但是，帝国主义者们贪心未足，他们又在越南煽动战争了。他们还在西方、在欧洲的心脏准备战争。谁都知道，一九五○年九月十九日西方国家外长召开纽约会议的结果是：西德与西柏林必须充分进行重新军国主义化，并把它们包括进侵略性的北大西洋公约之内，使它们成为发动反对德意志民主共和国、反对人民民主国家、反对苏联的战略基地。依照这些罪恶计划，英美帝国主义者正在增加它们驻西德的兵力，并建立德国雇佣军队，俾得向爱好自由的人类从事罪行时，用以充当炮灰。这就是帝国主义国家希望借以为反对欧洲各国人民的战争铺平道路的政策。我们决不可听任这种卑劣计划付诸实行。
    苏联妇女反法西斯委员会主席波波娃
    苏联妇女反法西斯委员会主席波波娃称：苏联妇女一致赞成并支持苏联政府的和平外交政策。她们热烈拥护苏联政府为巩固和平与安全所采取的一切措施，她们坚决主张取缔原子武器并裁减军备。我们已看出美英法三国的统治者是如何拚命地在欧洲扩大他们的侵略计划。他们蓄意把西欧变成他们对欧洲各民主国家人民作战的战略基地。他们为了要达到这个目标，就增加他们驻德军队的数目与武装，他们在西德建立雇佣军队，恢复西德战争工业，同时并削减平时生产。爱好和平的各国，不能漠视帝国主义者这种罪恶计划。世界各国人民必须揭露并击败美英法帝国主义者这种罪恶计划。波波娃叙述了各资本主义国家内的妇女保卫和平运动。在争取和平的斗争中，妇女们的意志日益坚决了，政治觉悟也日益提高，保卫和平的坚强决心已在形成。波波娃号召美，英，意，法，瑞典，芬兰各国妇女，全世界各国妇女，更英勇地，更坚决地为争取和平而斗争。
    英和委会主席克劳瑟
    英国和平委员会主席、世界和大常设委员会代表克劳瑟继波波娃发言称：主席先生、亲爱的苏联朋友们：我愿代表世界拥护和平大会常设委员会、代表一切爱好和平的人民向苏联人民、向在和平宣言上签了名的一亿一千五百万以上的苏联男女致以最热烈的敬意。我们衷心感谢他们在争取和平的斗争中的巨大努力。我们知道：有了他们的帮助，我们将赢得反对战争的斗争的胜利，并将赢得争取和平的战斗的胜利。
    克劳瑟继称：莫斯科的建设工作使他深为感动。在一年前莫斯科大学的建筑工程刚刚开始的地方，现在正在建立起巨大的楼房。难道说这不是苏联人民对和平与战争怎样看法的问题的回答么？而麦克阿瑟正在干些什么勾当呢？谁是侵略者——是那些建设大学的人们呢，还是那些向朝鲜城市投掷炸弹的人们？
    克劳瑟谈到英国准备第二届世界拥护和平大会的情形称：我们正在高兴地等待着苏联代表团、苏联工人阶级、农民与知识分子的首要代表们的到达。我们知道：他们是在创造天才与和平的建筑师——斯大林的指导下，领导人类走入社会主义、和平与进步世纪的伟大苏维埃国家的代表。
    其后发言的是塔吉克作家萨德、俄国老女演员雅布洛契金娜，拉脱维亚共和国福音路得教会大主教图尔斯和苏联著名联合收割机驾驶员鲍林。在讨论吉洪诺夫的报告中已经有三十八人发言。
    在下午的会上听取了资格审查委员会主席叶尔硕娃的报告。他宣布了第二届全苏拥护和平大会代表的成份。
    代表二亿爱好和平的苏联人民的一千一百七十二个代表，被选出席大会。苏联人民在派遣代表出席大会时，再度表示了他们一致拥护斯大林的外交政策——和平与国际友好的政策。第二届全苏拥护和平大会代表着苏联社会的各阶层。出席会议的有工人阶级代表二百一十名、集体农民代表一百五十七名。苏维埃知识分子也有广泛的代表。代表中有二百三十名工程师，八十四名教师，和三十一名医生。出席会议的苏联科学家代表有一百零五名科学院院士和科学院通讯院士，八十八名科学博士和硕士。代表中有著名的作家、诗人、作曲家、艺术家、电影导演以及教士和各种不同宗教信仰的代表。苏联境内的四十个民族也有代表出席。
    十七日，大会选举出委员会负责委任出席第二届世界和平大会的代表。
    听众对到会的世界和平大会常委会副主席鲍埃逊表示热烈欢迎。十八日，大会将继续开会。
