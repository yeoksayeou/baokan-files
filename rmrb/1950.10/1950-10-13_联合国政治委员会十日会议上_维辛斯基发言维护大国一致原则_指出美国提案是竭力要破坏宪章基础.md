(Xinhua News Agency, New York, 12th) TASS reports: The Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly met on the 10th to continue discussing the so-called "United Action for Peace" proposal put forward by the United States and seven other countries.

    Soviet representative Vyshinsky spoke at the meeting. He first outlined the Soviet Union's policy of fighting for peace. He declared: It is the sacred duty of every country to spare mankind from the scourge of war. He said that the issue of peace is of concern to hundreds of millions of people around the world, and the tide of demand for peace is surging more and more. Since its birth, the Soviet Union has adhered to a peaceful foreign policy. In previous sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, it has always been faithful to this policy and put forward proposals to strengthen international peace and security. Vyshinsky recalled that in 1946, the Soviet Union proposed universal disarmament and reduction of armed forces; in 1947, the General Assembly adopted a resolution condemning the propaganda of new wars based on the Soviet proposal; in 1948 and 1949, the Soviet Union called for a one-third reduction in armaments and advocated the conclusion of a peace convention. This year, the Soviet Union put forward a declaration of peace. Vyshinsky said that millions of people protested against all forms of military adventurism and firmly believed that the path suggested by the Soviet Union was entirely in line with their vital interests. But the struggle for peace is difficult, and many obstacles must be overcome. It is necessary to understand these obstacles. The initiators of the seven-nation proposal apparently believed that they had ascertained the essence of these obstacles on the road to peace and that they knew how to remove them. In his speech on September 20, Acheson attempted to answer the first question, and Dulles, in his speech on October 9, attempted to answer the question of how to remove obstacles on the road to peace. Vyshinsky asked: However, are these answers in line with the current situation and will they not cause huge errors? On September 20, Acheson asserted that the Soviet Union created obstacles to peace and posed a threat to peace.

    Vyshinsky went on to say: Because the drafters of the U.S. proposal deliberately spread the myth of the so-called Soviet aggressive policy, we feel it is necessary to restate what Stalin said to Howard in 1936. At that time, Stalin said that the Soviet Union never intended to use violence to force other countries to accept its own system, because the issue of social and political reform is an internal matter for the people of each country, and the idea of exporting revolution is meaningless.

    Vyshinsky then recounted that Dulles had defended the U.S. proposal, insisting that it was aimed at eliminating weaknesses in the United Nations organization, thereby strengthening its ability to stop acts of aggression. Vyshinsky pointed out: Some say that the U.S. proposal will become a "pillar" supporting the United Nations. In this way, it seems that the United Nations does not yet have pillars to support it, and this organization cannot be respected as an instrument of peace; however, the Soviet delegation cannot agree with this view. Dulles and others admitted that the United Nations must be strengthened in its task of maintaining peace. However, this is only lip service. In essence, the seven-nation proposal is an attempt to weaken the Security Council, reduce its power, and deprive it of its primary responsibility for maintaining peace. It is impossible to undermine the foundation of the United Nations on the one hand and strengthen the organization of the United Nations on the other, because without a doubt, the cornerstone of the United Nations is the Security Council, which alone has the right to confront aggression, prevent aggression, and command armed forces that other United Nations bodies are not authorized to convene.

    Vyshinsky continued: Dulles made four indirect conclusions in his speech to the committee: First, the Security Council cannot act quickly or fully because of the "veto." Second, the Security Council cannot obtain the information necessary to take swift and effective action because of the "veto." Third, the Security Council and the entire United Nations cannot have armed forces because of the "veto." Fourth, the Security Council or the United Nations cannot prevent aggression because of the "veto." From these conclusions of Dulles, a general conclusion is drawn, which is that the veto must be abolished. Vyshinsky asked: If so, why do the seven proposing countries not resort to the procedure for amending the Charter stipulated in the United Nations Charter to achieve their goal of abolishing the veto? The delegations of these countries also want to convince the Political Committee that the United Nations Charter has not been affected by this proposal, but in fact it is this proposal that is tearing up the Charter.

    Vyshinsky pointed out: In the discussions over the past two days, speakers have attacked the principle of great power unity in the Security Council, blaming all the failures experienced by the United Nations on this principle. This argument is unfounded. The difficulties in the United Nations are not due to the principle of great power unity, but because proposals to promote peace are obstructed by the Anglo-American bloc, which seeks to pass resolutions that promote its own interests and the interests of American monopoly capitalists. The United States does not want the "veto" because it has a compliant majority in the Security Council.

    Vyshinsky pointed out: This majority has obstructed the entry of new member states into the United Nations, obstructed proposals for resolving the atomic energy issue, and obstructed proposals for disarmament, and so on. Relying on the majority, the Anglo-American bloc strives to have its plans and proposals passed, regardless of the opinions of the minority and regardless of decisions that have been agreed upon. The root cause of the Security Council's inability to function lies in the position of the Anglo-American bloc, which possesses a majority, unwilling to seek agreement, but attempting to impose its will on the United Nations for the benefit of one or two countries.

    In response to Dulles's argument against the "veto," Vyshinsky pointed out: The foundation of international organizations is that each country respects the rights of other countries in the international organization, and does not adopt the method of one country issuing orders. Vyshinsky emphasized that the principle of great power unity is the basic principle of the United Nations.

    After recounting the constant attacks on the principle of great power unity since 1945, Vyshinsky pointed out: The form these attacks take is proposals to give the General Assembly and the Security Council equal powers, or proposals to place the General Assembly above the Security Council. Vyshinsky declared: But the United Nations Charter clearly gives the Security Council the primary responsibility for maintaining peace and international security. Vyshinsky recounted that the so-called "Interim Committee of the General Assembly" (i.e., the illegal "Little General Assembly") was established in 1947 with the aim of opposing the Security Council, and Dulles was the drafter of the Interim Committee proposal. But the Interim Committee has proven to be a miserable failure. Now there are new attempts to undermine the Security Council underway.

    Dulles and his ilk argued that because the Soviet Union did not attend the Security Council, the Security Council was able to act "effectively" in Korea. Regarding this argument, Vyshinsky pointed out: The Security Council acted illegally, and the resolutions of certain member states of the Security Council are not the resolutions of the Security Council.

    Vyshinsky cited President Roosevelt's words in 1944 to defend the principle of great power unity. At that time, Roosevelt said: The permanent members of the Security Council will be "the main defenders of peace." Vyshinsky also cited the report made by the U.S. Secretary of State to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July 1945. In that report, the Secretary of State emphasized: The permanent members of the Security Council must act together to maintain peace, just as they had to act together during the war to achieve victory.

    After pointing out again that the U.S. proposal is a desperate attempt to undermine the foundation of the Charter, Vyshinsky turned to the legal arguments cited by those who defended the proposal. Vyshinsky pointed out at the end of this part of the discussion: Any attempt to grant the General Assembly powers that belong entirely to the Security Council is a blatant violation of the Charter, and the realization of this attempt would have the most tragic consequences for world peace.

    When Vyshinsky went on to talk about the specific issues in the U.S. proposal, he said: The Soviet delegation does not oppose the first part of it, which advocates convening a special session of the General Assembly. However, the Soviet delegation cannot accept the provision that any seven members of the Security Council can convene a special session, and insists that such a session must be convened in accordance with the Charter. (According to the Charter: A special session shall be convened by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the request of the Security Council or at the request of a majority of the members of the United Nations.) Vyshinsky also opposed the provision that a special session could be convened within 24 hours, arguing that this provision was absurd. Vyshinsky pointed out: This would leave the representatives with no time to study the issues. He suggested that at least two days should be given before convening the meeting.

    Regarding the second part of the U.S. proposal, which stipulates the establishment of a so-called "Peace Observation Group" composed of nine to fourteen member states, Vyshinsky said: The General Assembly can establish such a committee, but this committee cannot become a tool of one or two countries and must be representative.

    Vyshinsky opposed the third part of the proposal, believing that it was clearly illegal. This part suggests that members of the United Nations maintain their armed forces in a state of combat readiness so that they can be "rapidly deployed for service as United Nations forces at the suggestion of the Security Council or the General Assembly." Vyshinsky said: This suggestion is an attempt to undermine and usurp the rights of the Security Council. Vyshinsky emphasized: According to the United Nations Charter, the Security Council has the primary responsibility for maintaining peace and international security. In response to Dulles's statement that the United Nations General Assembly only "suggests" and does not "order" military action, Vyshinsky pointed out that Dulles and others have acknowledged that a suggestion would morally equal an order.

    Vyshinsky asked: Where does the Charter grant the General Assembly the power to mobilize armed forces? The illegality of the suggestions in the third part is obvious. The Soviet Union opposes the establishment of an army as suggested in the proposal, because this would infringe on the powers that belong entirely to the Security Council.

    Vyshinsky pointed out: The fourth part of the proposal, which suggests the establishment of a "Collective Action Committee," is also illegal, because such a committee would collect materials of a military nature, thereby infringing on the power of the Security Council, which is responsible for maintaining peace and international security.

    Also speaking at the meeting on the 10th were representatives from Australia, Peru, Brazil, Yugoslavia, Cuba, and the Netherlands. They repeated the platitudes of the United States attacking the principle of great power unity and expressed their support for the proposal of the United States and seven other countries, but requested revisions to some of the points.

　　联合国政治委员会十日会议上
    维辛斯基发言维护大国一致原则
    指出美国提案是竭力要破坏宪章基础
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治及安全委员会十日开会，继续讨论美国等七国所提出的所谓“保障和平的联合行动案”。
    苏联代表维辛斯基在会上发言。他首先概述了苏联为和平而斗争的政策。他宣称：使人类免除战争灾难，是每一个国家的神圣职责。他说和平问题为全世界亿万人民所关怀着，要求和平的潮流是愈来愈汹涌了。苏联从它诞生的一天起就坚守着和平外交政策，在历届联合国大会中，它始终忠于这种政策，提出了加强国际和平与安全的建议。维辛斯基追忆说：在一九四六年，苏联提出了普遍裁减军备和武装部队的建议；在一九四七年，大会根据苏联的提议，通过了谴责新战争宣传的决议；在一九四八年和一九四九年，苏联号召裁减军备三分之一，并倡议缔订和平公约。今年，苏联提出了和平宣言。维辛斯基说，千百万人民抗议一切形式的军事冒险，深信苏联建议的道路完全符合他们的切身利益。但是争取和平的斗争是困难的，有许多障碍必须加以克服。了解这些障碍是很必要的。七国提案的发起人显然以为他们已经确知了这些和平道路上的障碍的本质，并以为确知了扫除这些障碍的方法。艾奇逊在九月二十日的发言中企图对第一个问题提出答案，杜勒斯在十月九日的演说中，企图答复应如何扫除和平道路上的障碍这一问题。维辛斯基问道：然而，这些答复是否符合当前情况，是否不致造成巨大的错误呢？在九月二十日，艾奇逊断言苏联制造了和平的障碍，并构成了对和平的威胁。
    维辛斯基更进一步说：由于美国提案的起草人别有用心地散布关于所谓苏联的侵略政策的神话，我们觉得有必要重述一下斯大林在一九三六年对霍华德的谈话，那时斯大林说，苏联永远不打算用暴力来强迫他国接受自己的制度，因为社会和政治改革的问题，是每个国家人民的内部事情，把革命输出的想法是毫无意义的。
    维辛斯基接着追述道：杜勒斯曾为美国提案辩解，硬说它是旨在取消联合国组织上的弱点，从而加强其制止侵略行为的能力。维辛斯基指出：有人说，美国的提案会成为支撑联合国的“支柱”。这样一来，好像联合国还没有支柱来支撑，这个组织还不能作为和平工具而受人尊重；但是，苏联代表团却不能同意这种看法。杜勒斯及其他的人承认，联合国在维持和平的任务方面必须予以加强。然而，这不过仅仅是嘴上说说而已。实质上，七国提案乃是力图削弱安理会，削减安理会的权力，并剥夺去安理会的维持和平的主要责任。一方面破坏联合国的基础，另一方面却要加强联合国的组织，这是不可能的，因为毫无疑义，联合国的基石就是安理会，唯有它具有对抗侵略、预防侵略与支配联合国其他机构所无权召集的军队的权利。
    维辛斯基继续说：杜勒斯对委员会的发言中有四个间接的结论：第一，由于“否决权”的关系，安理会无法迅速行动或者充分行动。第二，由于“否决权”的关系，安理会不能取得采取迅速有效的行动所必须的情报。第三，由于“否决权”的关系，安理会与整个联合国不能有武装部队。第四，由于“否决权”的关系，安理会或者联合国无法预防侵略。从杜勒斯的这几个结论中得出一个总的结论，就是必须取消否决权。维辛斯基发问道：既然如此，为什么七个提案国不诉诸联合国宪章所规定的修改宪章的程序，以达到它们废除否决权的目的呢？这些国家的代表团还想叫政治委员会相信，联合国宪章并没有因为这件提案而受到什么影响，然而事实上撕毁宪章的正是这个提案。
    维辛斯基指出：在过去两天的讨论中，各发言人攻击安理会中的大国一致原则，把联合国所经历的种种失败，都归咎于这一项原则。这种论调是没有根据的。联合国中所以产生困难，不是由于大国一致原则，而是由于促进和平的提案被力求通过增进其自身利益及美国垄断资本家利益的决议的英美集团所阻挠。美国所以不要“否决权”，是因为美国在安理会中拥有着随声附和的多数。
    维辛斯基指出：这一个多数派，阻挠了新会员国加入联合国，阻挠了解决原子能问题的提案以及裁减军备的提案等等。英美集团依靠着多数，努力使自己的计划与提案获得通过，而不顾少数的意见不顾，已获协议的决定。安理会所以不能发生作用的根源，就是在于拥有多数的英美集团的立场，它们不愿寻求协议，而是企图为了一两个国家的利益将自己的意志强加在联合国之上。
    维辛斯基在答复杜勒斯反对“否决权”的议论时指出：国际组织的基础，乃是每一个国家尊重该国际组织中其他各国的权利，而不采取一国发号施令的方法。维辛斯基着重指出：大国一致原则乃是联合国的基本原则。
    维辛斯基历述自一九四五年以来不断对大国一致原则所作的攻击后指出：这些攻击所采取的形式，就是给联大与安理会同等的权力的提案，或是置联大于安理会之上的提案。维辛斯基宣称：但联合国宪章明确赋与安理会以维护和平及国际安全的主要责任。维辛斯基追述称：一九四七年成立了所谓“大会临时委员会”（按即非法的“小型联大”），目的即在与安理会相抗衡，而杜勒斯就是临时委员会提案的草拟人。但临时委员会已证明归于惨败。现在又有破坏安理会的新企图在进行中。
    杜勒斯之辈狡辩说，由于苏联未出席安理会，所以安理会能够“有效地”在朝鲜行动，关于这种论据，维辛斯基指出：安理会是非法地行动的，安理会某些理事国的决议并不就是安理会的决议。
    维辛斯基引证一九四四年罗斯福总统的话来维护大国一致原则，那时罗斯福说：安理会常任理事国将是“和平的主要保卫者”。维辛斯基又引证了一九四五年七月美国国务卿向参院外交委员会所作的报告，在该报告中，国务卿着重指出：各常任理事国必须共同行动以保持和平，一如他们在战时为获得胜利而不得不共同行动一样。
    维辛斯基在再次指出美国的提案是竭力要破坏宪章的基础后，转而谈到为这个提案辩解的人们所引用的法律论据。维辛斯基在结束这一部分的讨论时指出：任何想把完全只属于安理会的权力授予大会的企图，都是彰明昭著地违反宪章，这种企图的实现对于世界和平有着最悲惨的后果。
    维辛斯基在继而谈到美国提案中的具体问题时说：苏联代表团并不反对其中关于主张召开联大特别会议的第一部分。然而苏联代表团不能接受安理会任何七个理事国都可召开特别会议的规定，并且坚持这种会议必须按照宪章召开。（按照宪章规定：特别会议应由联合国秘书长经安理会的请求或联合国过半数会员国的请求而召集。）维辛斯基还反对特别会议可以在二十四小时以内召开的规定，认为这种规定是荒谬的。维辛斯基指出：这样会使代表们没有时间研究问题。他建议在召开会议前应至少给予两天的时间。
    关于美国提案的第二部分，即规定成立由九个到十四个会员国组成的所谓“和平观察团”一节，维辛斯基说：联大可以成立这种委员会，但这种委员会不能成为一两个国家的工具，而必须是有代表性的。
    维辛斯基反对提案的第三部分，认为它显然是非法的。该部分建议联合国会员国保持其武装部队于准备作战状态，以便“根据安理会或联大的建议作为联合国部队而迅速供调遣服役”。维辛斯基说：这种建议是企图破坏和篡夺安理会的权利。维辛斯基着重指出：根据联合国宪章，安全理事会负有维持和平与国际安全的主要责任。维辛斯基在答复杜勒斯所说联合国大会仅仅“建议”，而不是“命令”军事行动的话时指出，杜勒斯和别的人都已承认，建议在道义上会等于命令。
    维辛斯基发问道：宪章在什么地方授与了大会以调动武装部队权力的呢？第三部分内的建议的不合法性是明显的。苏联反对成立像提案中所建议的军队，因为这样就会侵犯完全属于安理会的职权。
    维辛斯基指出：提案中建议成立“集体行动委员会”的第四部分，也是非法的，因为这样的委员会将搜集军事性质的材料，从而侵犯负责维持和平及国际安全的安理会的权力。
    在十日会议上发言的还有澳大利亚、秘鲁、巴西、南斯拉夫、古巴、荷兰代表。他们重复美国攻击大国一致原则的滥调，表示支持美国等七国提案，但要求修正其中若干点。
