　　Reversing Serious Spontaneous Flow Phenomenon
　　Chanan Autumn Cultivation Fully Underway
　　[Zhangjiakou News] Chahar Daily News on October 14: In the initial stage of the autumn cultivation movement in the Chanan area, a serious spontaneous flow phenomenon occurred. After the leadership issued instructions to correct and vigorously reverse this, it has been fully launched. Huai'an has 700,000 mu of autumn cultivation area, and 35 percent has been cultivated. In the Mowan Model Village, out of 2,180 mu of land, only 300 to 400 mu remain uncultivated. Longguan has cultivated 40 percent, approximately 220,000 mu. However, in some disaster areas of Yanqing and Sihai, difficulties remain great due to the sale of many livestock. Wanquan County has a total cultivated land area of ​​more than 540,000 mu, with 480,000 mu needing cultivation. 150,000 mu have been cultivated, accounting for 30 percent of the area that should be cultivated. Huailai County has a total area of ​​568,500 mu needing cultivation. Before September 26, 974 teams of livestock had been put to work, cultivating 64,310 mu. Xuanhua should have 800,000 mu of autumn cultivation area. According to statistics before September 30, 25 percent had been cultivated, totaling 200,000 mu. In Zhuolu, the Seventh District has achieved better results, with one-third of the land cultivated; the other districts are still far behind. In Zhangjiabao and other twelve villages, only fourteen teams of livestock were put to work, and only 400 mu had been cultivated by September 23. This should be brought to the attention of the county leadership, who should quickly reverse the situation and complete the autumn cultivation task.

　　扭转严重自流现象
    察南秋耕全面展开
    【张家口讯】察哈尔日报十月十四日消息：察南地区秋耕运动初期曾发生严重自流现象，经领导上指示纠正大力扭转后，已全面展开。怀安秋耕面积七十万亩，已耕百分之三十五。磨泥湾模范村，二千一百八十亩地，仅剩三、四百亩未耕。龙关已耕百分之四十，约二十二万亩。但延庆、四海部分灾区由于卖掉不少牲口，困难尚大。万全全县耕地面积五十四万多亩，需耕面积四十八万亩，已耕十五万亩，占应耕地百分之三十。怀来全县需耕面积五十六万八千五百亩，九月二十六日以前即上套九百七十四犋，耕过六万四千三百一十亩。宣化应秋耕面积八十万亩，九月三十日以前统计，耕过百分之二十五，合二十万亩。涿鹿以七区成绩较好，已耕地三分之一；其他各区还很不够。张家堡等十二村仅上套十四犋，至九月二十三日才耕了四百亩，值得该县领导上提起注意，并赶紧扭转过来，完成秋耕任务。
