　　United as One to Defend Peace
　　Zhang Shiyi
    "United as One" is a very familiar Chinese idiom, and this idiom expresses a truth, which is the truth practiced by the peace signature campaign.
    Since the establishment of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace a year ago, the peace signature campaign has been developing rapidly in China, just as in other countries. Now, whether in big cities or small towns, remote villages or backwaters, all have responded to the call of this movement.
    In this way, the will of the Chinese people to defend world peace has been guaranteed by each person who has signed their name. We have already built a new Great Wall to defend world peace, and countless peacekeepers have gathered on this new Great Wall, ready to fight against the warmongers.
    What kind of situation is this? This is the situation in which imperialism is bound to be eliminated. The basic force for eliminating imperialism lies in our "United as One."

　　众志成城保卫和平
    张士一
    “众志成城”是我们中国一句很熟的成语，这句成语表达了一个真理，就是和平签名运动所实践的真理。
    自从一年以前中国保卫世界和平大会委员会成立以来，和平签名运动在中国像在他国一样迅速的开展起来。到了现在，不论大城小市穷乡僻壤，都已经响应了这个运动的号召。
    这样，中国人民大众保卫世界和平的意志，已经由每一个签名的人写下自己的名字来作了保证。我们已经筑成了一道保卫世界和平的新的长城，在这道新的长城上已经集合了无数的和平卫士，准备向战争贩子们进行斗争。
    这是怎么一个形势？这是帝国主义必然消灭的形势。消灭帝国主义的基本力量就是在我们的“众志成城”。
