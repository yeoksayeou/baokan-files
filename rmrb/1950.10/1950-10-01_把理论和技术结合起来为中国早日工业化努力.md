　　Combine Theory and Technology, Strive for China's Early Industrialization
    Yu Songru, Industrial Labor Model Representative Directly Selected by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    As the National Conference of Representatives of Model Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers is opening, we are also celebrating the first National Day of our People's Republic of China. The new China has only been established for one year, and yet politics, economy, culture, and other aspects have made unprecedented and rapid progress. Such great achievements are due to the joint efforts of the people across the country under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. However, we must not become arrogant and complacent because of our achievements. The people of the whole country should continue to work hard to ensure the completion of our production tasks. Engineering personnel with technical experience should thoroughly change the bad habits cultivated in the old society, eliminate bureaucratic airs, sincerely unite with the workers, apply the theories we have learned to practice, and then use practical work experience to supplement the shortcomings in our theories. In this way, our work can develop day by day, our theories can be enriched day by day, and a fundamental improvement in economic construction can be achieved at an early date. In the second anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic, we will surely have even greater and more glorious successes. I hereby wish our new China early industrialization.

　　把理论和技术结合起来  为中国早日工业化努力
    全总直接评选工业劳模代表  于松如
    正当全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议开幕的时候，欣逢我们中华人民共和国第一个国庆节到来。新中国诞生迄今仅一年的时间，而政治、经济、文化等各方面都已在以空前未有的飞速进展。能够有这样大的成绩，是因为在毛主席和共产党领导下，全国人民共同努力造成的。但我们决不能因为有了成绩，就自骄自傲，全国人民都应当继续努力，保证完成我们的生产任务。具有技术经验的工程人员们，应当彻底改变在旧社会时薰染成的坏作风，根绝官僚架子，诚心诚意地与工友们团结起来，把我们学到的理论，灌注到实际中去，再用实际工作经验来补充我们理论中的缺点。这样，工作才能日益发展，理论才能日益充实，经济建设的基本好转，才能早日实现。在建国第二个周年的时候，一定能有更伟大更光辉的成功，我今谨在此预祝我们新中国早日工业化。
