　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 6th, TASS dispatch: *Pravda*'s New York correspondents, Lasadin and Filippov, wrote in their commentary on the progress of the Fifth United Nations General Assembly: The first stage of the General Assembly's work—the general debate—has concluded. During this process, the delegations of most countries expressed their opinions on the activities of the United Nations in the past year and put forward their proposals for the current tasks of the United Nations. The proceedings of each day of the Assembly illustrate that the US representatives came to the General Assembly without any intention of strengthening international cooperation through the United Nations.

　　During the general debate, two tendencies in international policy were clearly revealed. The Soviet Union demonstrated that it is a persistent and unwavering fighter for the cause of peace and international cooperation. The Anglo-American bloc, on the other hand, continues to implement its policy of undermining the United Nations and preventing it from becoming an instrument of peace and international cooperation.

　　The proposals of the Soviet delegation, embodied in the draft "Declaration on the Elimination of the Threat of a New War and the Consolidation of World Peace and Security," are entirely aimed at strengthening the United Nations and ensuring mutual trust and cooperation between large and small countries. The delegations of peace-loving countries in the General Assembly have unconditionally supported the Soviet proposals.

　　The proposals of the US delegation are covered by hypocritical words of peace, such as "conducting effective UN efforts," "opposing violations of peace," and so on. But in fact, the purpose of the US delegation's proposals is to undermine the Security Council—the most important body of the United Nations.

　　The principle of unanimity among the five permanent members of the Security Council is the foundation and primary law of the United Nations. It represents an effort to maintain and guarantee the cooperation of major powers for the peace and security of all nations.

　　After embarking on an aggressive foreign policy and beginning preparations for a new war, the ruling circles of the United States have abandoned their previous obligations. The actions of the US representatives in the United Nations reflect the current US policy—a policy of undermining international cooperation, a policy of arbitrarily forcing other countries to accept its will. It is very clear that the US representatives want to use their majority in the General Assembly to force through proposals that favor the United States, as well as those proposals that they cannot get the Security Council to accept.

　　But transferring the powers of the Security Council to the General Assembly is a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter and a move towards violating the principle of unanimity among the great powers, which is the only way to ensure the correct resolution of the most important international issues. The US proposal to establish UN armed forces, bypassing the Security Council, also violates the UN Charter. Disregarding the UN Charter, the US delegation proposes the establishment of UN armed forces that can act not only on the orders of the Security Council, but also on the "recommendations of the General Assembly." This also exposes the consistent attempt of the United States to violate the UN Charter, to transfer the legitimate rights of the Security Council to the General Assembly, while no one has ever granted the General Assembly the right to decide on coercive action and the use of armed forces.

　　Utilizing its mechanical majority in the General Assembly, the ruling circles of the United States can portray the liberation movements of various countries as "aggression" and use the United Nations as a tool to suppress these movements.

　　In conclusion, the authors emphasize that by contrasting the Soviet peace plan with the proposals of the US delegation, it can be seen that the Soviet Union advocates strengthening the United Nations, while the United States is pushing the organization into the abyss.

### 真理报驻纽约记者评五届联大  苏联主张加强联合国威信  美国则把联合国推向深渊

　　真理报驻纽约记者评五届联大
    苏联主张加强联合国威信
    美国则把联合国推向深渊
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科六日电：真进报驻纽约记者拉萨丁与费利波夫在评论联合国第五届大会的进程时写道：联大第一阶段的工作——一般辩论——已经结束。在这一过程中，大多数国家代表团都对过去一年中联合国的活动表示了自己的意见，并对联合国当前的任务提出它们的主张。大会每一天的进程都说明，美国代表到联大来，是毫无经过联合国以加强国际合作的意愿的。
    在一般辩论的过程中，国际政策上的两种倾向清晰地表明出来。苏联显示是为和平与国际合作事业奋斗的持久不渝的战士。而英美集团则继续实行其破坏联合国使之不成其为和平与国际合作之工具的政策。
    体现在“消除新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全宣言”草案中的苏联代表团的建议，其目的完全在加强联合国，保证大小国家间的相互信任与合作。联大中爱好和平的国家的代表团都无条件地支持苏联的建议。
    美国代表团的建议则用虚伪的和平的言词掩护起来，说什么“进行有效的联合国努力”，“反对侵犯和平”等等。但事实上，美国代表团的建议目的却在破坏安理会——联合国最重要的机构。
    安理会五个常任理事国一致的原则是联合国的基础和主要的法律。它表示一种为了一切国家人民的和平与安全而维持并保证各大国合作的努力。
    美国的统治集团在着手进行侵略性的外交政策，开始准备新的战争以后，就背弃了他们先前的义务。美国代表在联合国的行动反映了美国目前的政策——破坏国际合作的政策，独断地迫令其他国家接受其意志的政策。十分清楚的，美国代表们想利用他们在联大所握有的多数，强行通过有利于美国的提案，以及他们所不能使安理会接受的那些提案。
    但是把安理会的职权移给联大就是粗暴地违犯联合国宪章，和走向违犯大国一致原则，而这原则是保证正确地解决最重要的国际问题的唯一方法。美国提出的越过安理会以成立联合国武装部队的建议也违反了联合国宪章。美国代表团不顾联合国宪章，建议成立联合国武装部队，这种部队不仅能够遵照安理会的命令行动，而且能遵照“联大的建议”行动。这也暴露了美国一贯企图违犯联合国宪章，要把安理会的合法权利转移到联大，而任何人也不曾将决定强制行动和使用武装部队的权利授予联大。
    利用在联大中的机械的多数，美国统治集团就能把各国人民的解放运动说成是“侵略”，并利用联合国作镇压这些运动的工具。
    在结语中，该文作者强调指出，把苏联的和平方案，与美国代表团的建议对照一下，就可以看出苏联主张加强联合国，而美国则是把这个组织推向深渊。
