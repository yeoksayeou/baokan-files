Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 12th: TASS reports from Pyongyang: General Kim Il Sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean Democratic People's Republic, issued a letter to the Korean people on October 11th.

General Kim Il Sung began by stating: "Brothers and sisters! Brave officers and soldiers of the People's Army! Courageous male and female guerilla fighters! The American imperialists are continuing their aggressive offensive against our Korea, seeking to turn our fatherland into their colony and enslave our 30 million people. Although the bandits have suffered terrible blows during this period, losing more than 60,000 to 70,000 men, they have mobilized all their armed forces in the Pacific region and launched a general offensive. Our People's Army, defending every inch of our fatherland, has been forced to retreat. Now, our fatherland is in a very dangerous situation. Grave danger looms over our fatherland.

The Syngman Rhee clique, under the direction of the American imperialists, launched a civil war. As is well known, the government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic did not want this war and did not want this tragic bloodshed. Our government has taken every measure to strive for the peaceful unification of the fatherland. However, all our proposals have been rejected. The Syngman Rhee clique, until the last moment, obstructed the realization of the peaceful unification of the fatherland, and, under the direction of the American imperialists, prepared for a fratricidal war among Koreans.

Documents seized in Seoul prove that the Syngman Rhee clique had already attempted to attack North Korea in 1949. However, the powerful guerrilla movement in South Korea forced the American imperialists to postpone the launch of the fratricidal war among Koreans until 1950. The government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic received reliable intelligence in early May 1950 regarding preparations to invade North Korea, and was therefore able to take timely measures to prepare to repel this invasion. Therefore, when the Syngman Rhee army invaded the area north of the 38th parallel in late June, the People's Army not only repelled the Syngman Rhee traitors' invasion of the North, but also, with the support of the guerrillas and the entire Korean people, dealt the Syngman Rhee army a crushing blow. The People's Army, advancing south, was warmly welcomed everywhere by the people, defeated the Syngman Rhee army, and liberated the cities and villages of South Korea from the Syngman Rhee fascist terror regime. In the two months since the outbreak of the war, the People's Army has liberated more than 90 percent of the land in South Korea, driving the enemy into the narrow areas of North Gyeongsang Province and South Gyeongsang Province. The true organs of people's power—the People's Committees—have been re-established in the liberated areas of South Korea. In the liberated nine provinces, 108 counties, 1,186 districts, and 13,654 villages, elections of People's Committees at all levels have been successfully conducted with the active participation of the people. In addition, various democratic reforms that have been implemented in the North have also been implemented in the liberated areas of the South.

Land reform has been implemented by confiscating the land of American imperialists and traitors to the people, fulfilling the farmers' century-old dream. As a result of the land reform, 1,163,000 tenant farmers, landless farmers, and poor farmers have received 1.2 million 'cho' of land free of charge, becoming the masters of the land. In this way, the residents in the areas liberated by the People's Army began a new and happy life.

However, when the American imperialists saw the complete failure of the Syngman Rhee clique, which had launched a fratricidal war in Korea, they launched armed intervention in the Korean civil war. The purpose of the American imperialists' armed intervention in the Korean War is to turn Korea into an American colony and enslave the Korean people. The purpose of this intervention is also to suppress the national liberation movements of the peoples of Asian countries, and to transform Korea into a military strategic springboard for war against the Soviet Union and against China.

The American imperialists stole the name of the United Nations to cover up their aggressive plans in Korea. The American imperialists declared that the military actions in Korea were carried out in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council. But the American military intervention in Korea had already begun before the Security Council passed a resolution. The resolution itself has no legal effect because the representatives of two permanent members of the Security Council—the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China—did not participate in the vote, nor did our Korean representative. However, the predatory American imperialists, under the guise of the United Nations flag, have committed monstrous crimes in Korea. American planes and ships are destroying our peaceful cities and villages, and destroying the industrial enterprises created by the Korean people with their blood and sweat. American troops are massacring large numbers of peaceful residents, the old, the weak, women, and children, on our land. The American bandits are flagrantly violating the United Nations Charter and disregarding international law and moral principles, attempting to thwart the will and fighting spirit of the Korean people by barbaric methods.

However, the heroic People's Army, the guerrillas, and the entire Korean people have risen as one to fight against foreign aggression and for the freedom and independence of their fatherland. The entire Korean people, both at the front and in the rear, have demonstrated the highest degree of selflessness, patriotism, and heroism in the struggle for the independence of their fatherland. The American invading forces have suffered repeated defeats under the pressure of the heroic People's Army.

When faced with the direct threat of being completely driven out of our sacred land, the American imperialists, in order to restore their completely tarnished prestige and achieve their aggressive goals in Korea at any cost, mobilized the naval, land, and air forces stationed in the Pacific region, and transferred a portion of the Mediterranean Fleet, including reserve warships, to Korean waters.

In this way, the American aggressors mobilized a huge military force of tens of thousands of troops to participate in the Korean War, landing more than 50,000 troops at Incheon on September 16th. Hundreds of warships and more than 500 aircraft participated in the landing operation. The enemy intended to occupy Seoul, but the enemy did not immediately realize this attempt.

The People's Army, with the support of the Seoul People's Self-Defense Forces, blocked the offensive of the numerically superior enemy forces for fourteen days, thereby demonstrating exemplary selflessness and heroism in defending the fatherland.

On other battlefields, the enemy also had numerical superiority. In view of this situation, the People's Army had to retreat. A serious situation has developed on the battlefield. The enemy has reached the 38th parallel and has invaded the North.

General Kim Il Sung, after pointing out that the war waged by the Korean people against American imperialism is a just and sacred war, said: "Three months of war have shown how great the source of our people's strength is. The Korean people have demonstrated their invincible strength in the war for the freedom and independence of the fatherland, for democratic reforms, for a happy future, and against the conspiracies of the American imperialists and their lackeys—the Syngman Rhee gang, who want to plunge our people back into darkness, backwardness, enslavement, and suffering."

General Kim Il Sung then put forward the current tasks of the People's Army, workers, peasants, guerrillas, and the entire Korean people.

General Kim Il Sung, after pointing out that the entire progressive mankind sympathizes with the Korean people's struggle, said: "Our most important task at present is to defend every inch of our land with our blood, concentrate all our forces to deal a decisive blow to the enemy, and thoroughly and cleanly eliminate the foreign armed aggressors and their lackeys—the Syngman Rhee traitors—from our land. We will certainly give our enemy this decisive blow.

The entire Korean people must hold higher the flag of the Korean Democratic People's Republic and the flag of victory of the Korean people.

Glory to the heroic Korean People's Army!

Glory to the heroic guerrillas behind enemy lines!

Long live the heroic Korean people who have risen to fight for the independence, freedom, and honor of their fatherland, and against the imperialist aggressors!

　　金日成将军发表告朝鲜人民书
    号召集中一切力量给敌人以决定性打击
    彻底干净消灭美国侵略者及李承晚集团
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社平壤讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令金日成将军于十月十一日发表告朝鲜人民书。
    金日成将军首称：兄弟姊妹们！英勇的人民军官兵们！勇敢的男女游击队员们！美国帝国主义者继续对我们朝鲜进行侵略性的进攻，要把我们的祖国变成他们的殖民地，要把我们三千万人民变成他们的奴隶。虽然匪徒们在这一时期中遭受到可怕的打击，并损失了六、七万人以上，但他们却又动员了他们在太平洋地区的一切武装部队，发动了总攻。我们保卫祖国每一寸土地的人民军被迫退却。现在，我们祖国处在很危险的局势中。严重的危险笼罩着我们祖国。
    李承晚集团在美帝国主义者指使下发动了内战。众所周知，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府并不希望有这种战争，并不希望这种流血的悲剧。我们政府曾采取过一切措施，争取用和平方法统一祖国。但是，我们的一切建议全被拒绝了。李承晚集团直到最后一刻还阻挠祖国和平统一的实现，并在美帝国主义者的指使下，准备了朝鲜同族相残的内战。
    在汉城缴获的文件证明，李承晚集团在一九四九年就已经企图进攻朝鲜北部。但是南朝鲜的强大游击运动迫使美帝国主义者把朝鲜同族相残的内战的发动延迟到一九五○年。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在一九五○年五月初接获了有关准备进犯朝鲜北部的可靠情报，因而能够采取了及时的措施，准备击退这一进犯。因此，当李承晚军队在六月下旬进犯三八线以北地区时，人民军不但击退了李承晚卖国贼们对北部发动的进犯，并且在游击队和全体朝鲜人民的支持下，给予李承晚军以粉碎性的打击，向南推进的人民军，到处受到人民热烈欢迎，击溃了李承晚军队，从李承晚法西斯恐怖政权下解放了朝鲜南部的城市与乡村。在战争爆发以来的两个月中，人民军解放了朝鲜南部百分之九十以上的土地，把敌人赶到庆尚北道与庆尚南道的狭小地区内。人民当权的真正机关——人民委员会，已在朝鲜南部的解放地区重行建立起来。在已解放了的九个道、一百零八县、一千一百八十六个区和一万三千六百五十四个村中，已在人民的积极参加下，顺利地进行了各级人民委员会的选举。此外，已在北部实施的各种民主改革，也已在南部解放地区实施了。
    用没收美帝国主义者和人民叛徒的土地的办法，实行了土地改革，使农民们百年来的梦想得以实现。土地改革的结果，一百一十六万三千雇农、无地的和贫苦的农民，无代价地得到了一百二十万町步的土地；成为土地的主人。这样，人民军所解放了的地区中的居民就开始了新的幸福的生活。
    但是，美帝国主义者看到在朝鲜发动同族相残的内战的李承晚集团完全失败，就对朝鲜的内战发动武装干涉。美帝国主义者对朝鲜战争所进行的武装干涉的目的是把朝鲜变为美国的殖民地并奴役朝鲜人民。这种干涉的目的，也在于要镇压亚洲各国人民的民族解放运动，也在于要变朝鲜为反对苏联、反对中国的战争的军事战略跳板。
    美帝国主义者盗窃联合国的名义来掩盖它们在朝鲜的侵略计划。美帝国主义者宣布说：在朝鲜的军事行动是根据联合国安全理事会的决议进行的。但美国在朝鲜的军事干涉，却在安全理事会通过决议之前就已经开始了。这种决议本身就没有法律效力，因为通过这个决议时安全理事会的两个常任理事国——苏联和中华人民共和国——的代表并没有参加，我们朝鲜的代表也没有参加。但是，掠夺成性的美帝国主义却在联合国旗帜的掩饰下，在朝鲜制造了滔天罪行。美国飞机和舰只，毁灭着我们的和平城市与乡村，破坏着朝鲜人民用血汗创造的工业企业。美国军队在我们的国土上屠杀大批的老弱妇孺的和平居民。美国匪帮穷凶极恶地违犯联合国宪章，并无视国际公法与道德规则，企图用野蛮的方法挫折朝鲜人民的意志与战斗精神。
    但是，英勇的人民军、游击队和全体朝鲜人民已经像一个人一样地起来，为反对外国侵略，争取祖国的自由与独立而斗争。前方和后方的全朝鲜人民在争取祖国独立的斗争中，表现了最高度的忘我精神、爱国主义和英雄主义。美国侵略部队在英勇的人民军的压力下，接二连三地惨遭失败。
    美帝国主义当其面临着从我们神圣的土地上被完全赶走的直接威胁时，为了恢复其完全扫地的威信，并不惜任何牺牲以达到他们在朝鲜的侵略目的，就动员了驻在太平洋地区的海、陆、空军部队，并且将地中海舰队的一部分包括后备军舰在内，调到朝鲜海面来。
    这样，美国侵略者动员了为数达数万人巨大军事力量参加朝鲜战争，于九月十六日以五万以上军队在仁川登陆。数百艘军舰和五百多架飞机参加登陆行动。敌人曾打算占领汉城，但是敌人并没有立刻实现这一企图。
    人民军在汉城人民自卫队的支持下，在十四天的过程中阻止了数量上占优势的敌军的进攻，从而表现出保卫祖国的模范的忘我精神和英雄主义。
    在其他战场上，敌人在数量上也占优势。鉴于这种情况，人民军只得后撤。战场上已经发生了严重情况。敌军已抵达三八线，并已进犯北部。
    金日成将军在指出朝鲜人民所进行的反对美帝国主义的战争是正义的、神圣的战争后说：三个月的战争已经表明：我们人民力量的源泉是如何的巨大。朝鲜人民在为了祖国的自由和独立，为了民主改革，为了幸福的将来，为了反对美帝国主义者及其走狗——要使我们人民再次陷入黑暗、落后、奴役、和痛苦之中的李承晚伙帮——的阴谋而进行的战争中，显示了我们人民不可战胜的力量。
    金日成将军随即提出人民军、工人、农民、游击队、全朝鲜人民当前的任务。
    金日成将军在指出整个进步人类都同情朝鲜人民的斗争后说：目前我们最重要的任务是用我们的血保卫我们的每一寸土地，集中一切力量给敌人以决定性的打击，彻底干净地消灭我们土地上的外国武装侵略者及其走狗——李承晚卖国贼之流。我们必将给予我们的敌人以这种决定性的打击。
    全体朝鲜人民必须更高地举起朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的旗帜和朝鲜人民的胜利旗帜。
    光荣归于英勇的朝鲜人民军！
    光荣归于敌后英勇的游击队！
    为了祖国的独立、自由和荣誉，为了反对帝国主义侵略者而奋起战斗的英勇的朝鲜人民万岁！
