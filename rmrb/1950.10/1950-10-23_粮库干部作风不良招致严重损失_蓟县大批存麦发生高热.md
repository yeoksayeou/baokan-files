Bad Work Style of Grain Depot Cadres Leads to Serious Losses
Ji County Large Quantities of Stored Wheat Experience High Heat

[Report from our newspaper in Ji County] Our newspaper correspondent Wang Lijun reports: Grain depot cadres in Ji County, Hebei Province, lack a sense of responsibility towards the country and the people, relax their management of the grain depot, and neglect careful inspection and turning over of grain for airing. As a result, 2,030,000 jin of wheat have experienced high heat, and some has even become moldy. The cadres of the warehouse also carelessly lent more than 210,000 jin of wheat that could not germinate to the masses as seed wheat. Some households planted these seeds, and they did not sprout. This has resulted in serious losses for the country and the people.

The grain depot within Ji County originally stored 2,030,000 jin of wheat. As early as late July, when the summer grain was entering the warehouse, the Ji County People's Government instructed the grain depot to set up separate warehouses for the full, high-germination-rate wheat and pay attention to its storage, in order to lend or exchange it to the masses for seed wheat when planting season arrived. In early September, the Tong County Special District Bank allocated 400,000 jin of wheat to Ji County for seed loans to assist disaster victims in 53 villages in the Qingdianwa area in planting wheat. At that time, it was decided that the Ji County Grain Depot would allocate 370,000 jin (at that time, the Ji County Grain Depot's wheat had been decided to be transferred to the Ji County Grain Branch Company, and the Ji County Bank purchased it from the branch company), and the bank would prepare 30,000 jin itself. The cadres of the grain depot had a serious bureaucratic work style and lacked a sense of responsibility towards the country and the people. They believed that these grains would be transferred to the Ji County Grain Branch Company sooner or later, and the quality of the grain had little to do with their responsibility. Therefore, their enthusiasm for protecting the grain disappeared, and they were careless in storing the wheat. This wheat entered the warehouse on July 28. By September 20, for two months, it had not been turned over or aired. Each grain depot only had two or three small windows on the top, and there was no ventilation equipment at the bottom of the warehouse. The air inside the warehouse was not circulating, and the wheat gradually became hot. On September 6, when measured with a thermometer, the temperature of the wheat in some warehouses had risen to 35 degrees Celsius, and some warehouses had reached 40 degrees. By September 15, the measurement showed that some were even higher, reaching 42 degrees. Generally, when the temperature of the grain rises to around 30 degrees, it should be quickly turned over and aired, but the cadres of the depot ignored this and did not actively try to turn it over and air it, resulting in most of the 2,030,000 jin of wheat becoming hot and smelling moldy (the wheat grains did not change color). Because the grain depot cadres lacked experience, they did not learn from the masses at this time and did not understand that heated seed wheat would not sprout. Before lending the seed wheat, the cadres of the depot did germination tests on the upper-layer wheat grains that had not been exposed to heat, and more than 90% of the wheat grains sprouted. Therefore, the cadres of the depot mistakenly believed that the germination rate was very high and ignored the inspection of the middle and lower layers of wheat in the warehouse. When the borrowers picked up the wheat on September 20, they smelled a strong moldy smell, but the cadres in the depot did not pay attention and did not report it to the leadership and relevant departments in a timely manner. On September 22, Xie Chengwu, secretary of the county committee, heard that the wheat was hot and ran to the grain depot to suggest to Xia Keming, the director of the grain depot: "Heated seed wheat is afraid of not sprouting, it should be tested again." Xia Keming replied subjectively: "Guarantee 100% germination," and ignored this correct suggestion. It was not until September 27, after the county leadership sent special personnel to test and inspect the villages, that it was proven that not many wheat seeds were sprouting. But at this time, 219,439 jin had already been distributed to the masses. Some villages that took the seed wheat automatically exchanged it at relatives' and friends' homes or in the market because the test showed no germination; some villages had already planted it, but very few seedlings emerged. This has caused great losses to the wheat planting work, and the masses' reaction is very bad.

When the county government discovered that the seed wheat was not sprouting, it immediately notified the county grain depot to stop distributing it and to turn over and air all the wheat currently stored in the warehouse. For the 150,000 jin of seed wheat that had not been distributed, it was agreed with the county supply and marketing cooperative that the wheat stored by the Fifth District Cooperative would be allocated. At the same time, Xia Keming and others were sent urgently to various villages to inspect. For those that had not been planted, the masses were mobilized to exchange them at relatives' and friends' homes or in the market; for those that had been planted but had not sprouted, the masses were mobilized to replant, and the county would provide supplementary loans of seed wheat. After the incident, the county government investigated the responsibility and found that the cause of this error was primarily due to the bureaucracy of the grain depot cadres, their lack of a sense of responsibility to the country and the people, their poor management of the grain depot, their failure to turn over and air the grain in a timely manner, and their refusal to accept correct opinions from others when lending seed wheat. Secondly, the lending departments and the Ji County Bank only emphasized procedures and never inspected the grain depot to check the quality of the seed wheat and its germination rate. As a result, seed wheat that could not germinate was lent to the masses. The Tong County Special District Grain Depot also has a responsibility. At the end of August, the Ji County Grain Depot made a budget for turning over the grain, and the Special District Grain Depot instructed: "Your grain should be received (referring to the Ji County Grain Branch Company receiving it), receiving it is the same as turning it over." Therefore, it was not approved. When the wheat was experiencing high heat, the county depot reported it to the Special District Grain Depot, but the Special District Grain Depot still did not instruct how to handle it. Later, the county grain depot sent people several times to urge the Ji County Grain Branch Company to receive it quickly, but the person in charge of the branch company always replied "in a couple of days," and it has been delayed until now without being received.

The Ji County People's Government and the grain depot have made a profound self-criticism for their bureaucratic work style of not seriously inspecting the seed wheat and causing huge losses to the country and the people, and have reported to the special commissioner's office, requesting punishment.

　　粮库干部作风不良招致严重损失
    蓟县大批存麦发生高热
    【本报蓟县讯】本报通讯员王立钧报道：河北蓟县粮库干部缺乏对国家对人民负责的思想，放松对粮库的管理，忽视认真检查、翻晒，致使二百零三万斤小麦发生高热，有些且已发霉。该仓库干部又麻痹大意地把不能出芽的小麦，贷给群众二十一万余斤作麦种。有些户种上这些麦种，没有出苗。结果给国家和人民造成严重的损失。
    蓟县城内粮库原保存小麦二百零三万斤。远在七月下旬夏征小麦入库时，蓟县人民政府便指示该粮库把麦粒饱满发芽率较高的小麦，另设仓库注意保管，以备种麦时贷给群众或换给群众。九月初，通县专区银行拨给蓟县四十万斤小麦贷种，扶助青甸洼五十三个村的灾民种麦，当时决定由蓟县粮库拨付三十七万斤（当时蓟县粮库小麦已决定移交给蓟县粮食支公司，蓟县银行是由支公司购买的），另由银行自备三万斤。该粮库干部存在着严重的官僚主义作风，缺乏对国家对人民负责的观点，认为这些粮食早晚要移交给蓟县粮食支公司，粮食好坏与自己责任不大。因此，他们护粮的热情就没有了，保管小麦漫不经心。这些麦子于七月二十八日入库，到九月二十日，两个月中，始终没有捣库、翻晒。各粮库上边只有两三个小窗户，库底下没有透风设备，库内空气不流通，麦子渐渐发热；在九月六日用温度表测量，有些库中麦子的温度升至摄氏三十五度，有的库已达四十度；到九月十五日测量，有的更高到四十二度。一般粮食温度升至三十度左右，就应赶快翻晒，而该库干部却漠然处之，不积极设法翻晒，致使二百零三万斤小麦大部发热，发生霉气味（麦粒没变色）。粮库干部因缺乏经验，这时还不向群众学习，不了解麦种受热就不出芽了。贷放麦种前，该库干部曾以上层未受折磨的麦粒作发芽试验，有百分之九十以上的麦粒出了芽，因此，该库干部便错误地认为发芽率很高，忽视了对库粮中下层麦子的检查。当九月二十日受贷户取麦时，嗅到很大霉味，库内干部还未注意，也未及时向领导上和有关部门报告。九月二十二日县委会秘书谢承武听说麦子发热，跑到粮库向粮库主任夏克明建议：麦种受热怕不出芽，应该再试验一下，夏克明竟主观地回答：“保证百分之百发芽”，没有理会这一正确建议。直到九月二十七日，经县领导上派专人试验和到村检查，才证明麦种种上出苗不多。但这时已经发到群众手中二十一万九千四百三十九斤。各村取去的麦种，有的因试验不出芽，自动到亲朋家或集市上串换了；有些村群众已经种上，出苗很少。这对种麦工作造成很大损失，群众反映很不好。
    县府发觉麦种不出芽，马上通知县粮库停止发放，并全部翻晒库内现存小麦。对尚未发下去的十五万斤麦种，和县社商妥，由五区社所保存的小麦拨付。同时，派了夏克明等急到各村检查，对尚未种上的，发动群众到亲友或集市上去串换；对已种上没有出苗的，发动群众翻种，麦种由县补贷。县府事后追查责任，发现这种错误的造成，首先是由于粮库干部官僚主义，缺乏对国家对人民负责的观点，对粮库管理不善，不及时捣库、翻晒，而在贷放麦种时，又拒绝接受别人提出的正确意见。其次，各贷种主管部门及蓟县银行光强调手续忙，始终没有到粮库检查一下，对麦种好坏发芽率高低全不知道。结果把不能发芽的麦种贷给了群众。通县专区粮库也有责任，八月底蓟县粮库造捣库费预算，专区粮库指示：“你们粮食该接收了（指由蓟县粮食支公司接收），接收和捣库一样。”遂不予批准。在麦子发高热时，县库又报告到专区粮库，但专区粮库仍未指示如何处理。后来县粮库又几次派人催促蓟县粮食支公司快接收，支公司负责人老是回答“过两天”，一直拖延到现在尚未接收。
    蓟县人民政府和粮库对麦种没有认真检查因而给国家和人民造成巨大损失的官僚主义作风，已作了深刻检讨，并报告专署，请求处分。
