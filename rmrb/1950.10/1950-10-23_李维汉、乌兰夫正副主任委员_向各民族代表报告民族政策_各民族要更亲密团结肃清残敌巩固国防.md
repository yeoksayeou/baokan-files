The "Report Meeting on Nationalities Issues" held by the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government, featured reports by Li Weihan, Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, and Ulanhu, Vice-Chairman, on the 17th and 19th respectively, regarding national policies and the situation in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

More than 1,000 people attended the meeting, including representatives of various nationalities who came to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations, ethnic minority artists, and cadres from various organizations in the capital.

Chairman Li Weihan recounted the facts of various persecutions and devastations inflicted upon the nationalities by the reactionary ruling class of Great Han chauvinism in the past, and pointed out that the Chinese people—including the Han nationality and the people of all nationalities—under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, after decades of heroic struggle, finally overthrew the common enemy of the people of all nationalities—the running dog of American imperialism and representative of Great Han chauvinism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The establishment of the great Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has brought about a fundamental and epoch-making change in our domestic ethnic relations, transforming the relations of oppression and being oppressed between nationalities created by reactionary rulers for thousands of years into brotherly relations of equality and love. In the future, all fraternal nationalities must unite more closely, under the banner of Chairman Mao and under the leadership of the Central People's Government, to fight for the thorough elimination of domestic remnants, the consolidation of national defense, and the opposition to American imperialism's expansion of aggressive war. On the basis of unity and cooperation, we must finally eliminate the phenomena of mutual discrimination and distrust created by successive reactionary ruling classes, and especially on the basis of unity and cooperation, we must, through long-term efforts, eliminate the de facto inequalities in politics, economy, and culture among nationalities created by reactionary ruling classes, and build the People's Republic of China into a strong and happy big family of friendly cooperation. Finally, Chairman Li focused on how to consolidate unity among nationalities and conscientiously implement regional autonomy and vigorously cultivate ethnic minority cadres.

Vice-Chairman Ulanhu presented a beautiful vision for the future to the people of all nationalities when introducing the situation in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Vice-Chairman Ulanhu recounted the devastation suffered by the people of Inner Mongolia under the reactionary rule of the Manchus, the Northern Warlords, the Kuomintang, and Japanese imperialism, as well as the tortuous path of struggle by the people of Inner Mongolia under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, with the help of the Han nationality and the people of all nationalities, and with the assistance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, finally achieving liberation. It shows that the Inner Mongolian people's liberation movement is part of the Chinese people's liberation movement. The people of Inner Mongolia have proven from personal experience that without the Chinese Communist Party, there would be no liberation of the whole of China, let alone the liberation of the people of Inner Mongolia. Vice-Chairman Ulanhu also listed the achievements made in military, political, economic, and cultural aspects since the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government in 1947, vividly illustrating that today, for all nationalities within China to achieve the thorough liberation of their own nationality, there is only one path: like Inner Mongolia, they must rally closely around the Central People's Government under the banner of Chairman Mao, implement regional autonomy, and advance hand in hand with all fraternal nationalities.

　　李维汉、乌兰夫正副主任委员
    向各民族代表报告民族政策
    各民族要更亲密团结肃清残敌巩固国防
    【本报讯】中央人民政府政务院民族事务委员会所主持的“民族问题报告会”，于十七、十九两日分别由民族事务委员会主任委员李维汉、副主任委员乌兰夫分别作民族政策与内蒙自治区情况报告。
    参加会议的有来京参加国庆盛典的各民族代表、各民族文艺工作者及首都各机关团体干部共一千余人。
    李维汉主任委员历述了过去大汉族主义反动统治阶级所加于各民族种种迫害与摧残的事实后，指出：中国人民——包括汉民族及各民族人民，在毛主席和中国共产党领导下，经过几十年英勇奋斗的结果，终于把各民族人民公敌——美帝国主义走狗、大汉族主义代表蒋介石匪帮打倒了，伟大的中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立了，这样便使得我们国内民族关系起了一个根本的、划时代的变化，把几千年来反动统治者所造成的民族间压迫与被压迫的关系，变成平等友爱的兄弟般的关系。今后各兄弟民族要更加亲密地团结在一起，在毛主席旗帜之下和在中央人民政府领导之下，为彻底肃清国内残敌、巩固国防、反对美帝国主义扩大侵略战争而奋斗。并在团结合作的基础上，最后消除历代反动统治阶级所造成互相间的歧视与不信任现象，特别是要在团结合作的基础上，经过长期的努力，消灭反动统治阶级所造成各民族间政治、经济、文化上存在着事实上的不平等现象，把中华人民共和国建设成一个强盛的、幸福的友爱合作的大家庭。最后，李主任委员并着重就如何巩固各民族间的团结与认真实行区域自治和大量培养民族干部两大问题加以说明。
    乌兰夫副主任委员作内蒙自治区情况介绍时，给各民族人民画出一幅美丽的远景。乌兰夫副主任委员历述内蒙人民在满清、北洋军阀、国民党及日本帝国主义反动统治时代备受摧残，以及内蒙人民在中国共产党领导、在汉民族及各民族人民的帮助、在中国人民解放军的援助下经过曲折斗争的道路，终于获得了解放的事实。说明：内蒙人民解放运动是中国人民解放运动的一部分。内蒙人民已经从切身体验中证明：没有中国共产党就没有全中国的解放，更没有内蒙人民的解放。乌兰夫副主任委员并列举一九四七年内蒙自治区人民政府成立以来，在军事、政治、经济、文化上各方面的成就，生动地说明：今天中国境内各民族要求得本民族彻底的解放，只有一条道路，就是像内蒙一样地，在毛主席的旗帜下，紧紧地团结在中央人民政府周围，实行区域自治，与各兄弟民族携手并进。
