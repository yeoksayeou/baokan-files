　　Brief Biography of Martyr Zuo Quan
　　Comrade Zuo Quan, a native of Liling, Hunan, died at the age of thirty-six. A middle school graduate, he joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1925. After graduating from the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy, he participated in the East River Campaign to unify Guangdong. Later, he was sent by Whampoa to study at the Moscow Military University for three years. After returning to China in 1930, he was sent by the CPC Central Committee to work in the Central Soviet Area. In the same year, after the Ningdu Uprising, he was ordered to serve as the political commissar of the 15th Army of the Red Fifth Army Group, and later as the army commander. In 1933, he was transferred to serve as the chief of staff of the First Army Group, and remained in his original post when he arrived in northern Shaanxi during the Long March. In 1936, he was promoted to acting commander of the Red Army's First Army Group. After the reorganization of the Eighth Route Army, he served as the deputy chief of staff of the Eighth Route Army until his death.
　　On May 19, 1942, approximately 30,000 enemy troops in the southeast of Shanxi Province launched a large-scale "mopping-up" operation against the First and Sixth Military Sub-districts of the Taihang Anti-Japanese Base Area. The Eighth Route Army rose up to meet the enemy and engaged in fierce battles. On June 2, Deputy Chief of Staff Zuo led the main force of the 385th Brigade to attack the enemy who had infiltrated Matian (southeast of Liaoxian County). They made contact with the enemy in the Shangxiaqingquan area south of Matian. Over a thousand enemy troops in and around Matian, upon hearing the news, rushed to join the battle. Deputy Chief of Staff Zuo commanded his troops to repeatedly charge and kill the enemy. After a day of fierce fighting, they were defeated, and the enemy retreated to Matian in panic at midnight. In this battle, the enemy left behind more than two hundred corpses and a batch of weapons and ammunition. Unfortunately, Deputy Chief of Staff Zuo also heroically sacrificed his life in this brave command of the battle, struck by a bullet.
　　Comrade Zuo Quan was one of the most prominent military strategists in our country. His achievements in strategy and tactics were a fusion of the most progressive tactics of the Great Revolution era of 1925-27, the civil war era, and the Soviet Red Army, making him one of the creators of China's famous guerrilla tactics. He made an indelible contribution to the perseverance of the anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines in North China. His death is not only a major loss for the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, but also an irreparable loss for the Chinese nation and the Chinese people. (Attached picture)

　　左权烈士略传
    左权同志，湖南醴陵人，享年三十六岁。中学毕业生。一九二五年加入中国共产党。黄埔军校第一期毕业后，曾参加统一广东的东江战役。后由黄埔保送赴莫斯科军事大学学习三年。一九三○年回国后，由中共中央派赴中央苏区工作。同年宁都起义，奉令任红五军团十五军政治委员，旋任军长。一九三三年又调任一军团参谋长，经长征到达陕北时仍任原职。一九三六年升任红军第一军团代军团长。改编八路军后，即任八路军副参谋长。直至牺牲。
    一九四二年五月十九日，晋东南周围之敌共约三万余人，分路向太行抗日根据地一分区及六分区进行大举“扫荡”。八路军奋起迎击，与敌发生激烈战斗。六月二日，左副参谋长率三八五旅主力，出击窜犯麻田（辽县东南）之敌，当在麻田以南上下清泉地区与敌接触，麻田及其附近之敌千余，闻讯，陆续驰来参加作战，左副参谋长指挥所部，向敌反复冲杀，激战竟日，将其击溃，敌仓惶于午夜退回麻田。是役敌遗尸二百余具及械弹一部。不幸，左副参谋长亦在这次奋勇指挥作战中，中弹壮烈牺牲。
    左权同志为我国有数之军事家，他在战略战术方面的成就，实融会一九二五——二七年大革命时代，内战时代及苏联红军最进步的战术，为中国著名的游击战术创造人之一。他对于坚持华北敌后抗战，有其永不可灭的功绩。他的死，不仅是中国共产党、人民解放军的重大损失，同时也是中国民族与中国人民不可弥补的损失。（附图片）
