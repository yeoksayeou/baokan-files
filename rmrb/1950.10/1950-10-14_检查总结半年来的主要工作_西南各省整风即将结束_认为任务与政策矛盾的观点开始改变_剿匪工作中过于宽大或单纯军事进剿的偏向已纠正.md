[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The rectification movement in the Southwest region, based on the spirit of the directives on rectification from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Southwest Bureau, began in mid-June at the level of the Southwest Great Administrative Region organs, and then unfolded into a large-scale rectification movement throughout the provinces. It has lasted for more than three months and is estimated to be completed soon. In terms of methods, in addition to the general rectification within the organs, each province and region first concentrated on the rectification of leading cadres at the county level and above. Eastern Sichuan, Western Sichuan, and Xikang used the form of rectification meetings. Yunnan, Guizhou, and Northern Sichuan adopted the form of Party representative meetings. The Southern Sichuan District Party Committee used the method of holding expanded cadre meetings. The concentrated rectification time for county-level and above cadres generally lasted about half a month. After that, rectification meetings or top-down training classes were used to continue to deepen the rectification movement and complete the rectification of general cadres below the county level. Regardless of the form, all involved reading documents, listening to work summary reports from responsible comrades, checking and summarizing work, and promoting democracy and correctly carrying out criticism and self-criticism to criticize bureaucratism, commandism, and closed-doorism in the work.

The characteristics and experiences of this rectification are: Generally, all localities have paid attention to closely linking it with the current practical work. Focusing on reviewing the work in the six months since the liberation of Southwest China, analyzing the situation, launching criticism and self-criticism, affirming achievements in the work, and criticizing shortcomings and errors, it is not a vague and aimless rectification or a general personal ideological reflection, but a top-down level-by-level review, summarizing work, absorbing experience, and checking the implementation of policies to achieve the goal of improving work and raising the level of policy thinking. For example, in the process of checking the work, each region discovered a common problem, that is, many cadres ideologically held confused views such as "if you want to complete the task, you cannot implement the policy," or "if you act according to the policy, you cannot complete the task," and "if the task is urgent, you cannot but use coercive measures." After in-depth discussion and criticism and self-criticism, everyone finally realized the consistency of policy and task. Moreover, they have been proven by the actual facts of grain collection, that is, those thoughts that "regardless of policy or not, completing the task is good," and the set of methods accustomed to being simple, rigid, coercive, and even hanging and beating people, cannot truly complete the task; on the contrary, those areas that do not rely on hanging and beating people for coercive commands but are good at using policies and organizing all forces, complete the task better and earlier. For example, some areas found in the disaster relief work that, due to lack of investigation and research, the loan grains were distributed equally, and some were even lent to landlords, causing extremely bad effects. This illustrates the harm of being divorced from the policies of the Party and the People's Government due to bureaucracy and commandism. On the issue of bandit suppression, many areas found that in the early stage of bandit suppression after entering Southwest China, due to the lack of specific and correct analysis of the political nature and harm of the bandits in the Southwest region and the ideology of the broad masses, and due to the fear of "left" and the fear of killing too many people, a one-sided policy of "boundless leniency" (that is, only leniency without suppression) or purely military suppression without political winning over was adopted, and they were divorced from the broad masses. Later, this policy was quickly corrected, and a policy combining leniency and suppression was adopted. Bandit suppression has achieved significant victories and won the enthusiastic support of the masses. This kind of rectification that starts from reality and focuses on checking and summarizing work is very beneficial to improving the work of cadres and raising the level of policy thinking of cadres.

Secondly, due to the influence of certain deviations towards individual Party members and cadres in individual regions and departments in the two previous rectifications in the history of our Party, and also because of the simple emphasis on criticism and self-criticism in a period before the Southwest rectification, many cadres were carrying out rectification with some doubts. Therefore, at the beginning of the rectification, almost all had to go through a period of dispelling their doubts and concerns about the rectification before they could be smoothly guided onto the right track. However, because our rectification this time is not a general inspection of thoughts, but focuses on checking and summarizing work, analyzing the situation, and studying policies, especially the inspiring reports of work inspection and summary by leaders taking the lead, first helping the general cadres to improve their understanding, as a result, the cadres' doubts and concerns were quickly eliminated. Not only did they no longer fear rectification, but they also felt the joy of rectification, feeling that "rectification is of great help to work and thought, and it would be good to have a few more times in the future." and felt that the rectification time was too short. This rectification not only did not hurt the enthusiasm of cadres, but also enlightened the cadres' consciousness and increased their confidence in future work.

Finally, whether rectification can achieve the goals of checking and summarizing work, improving work, and raising the level of policy thinking of cadres, whether it will take detours, and whether it will quickly get on the right track, the key issue lies in leadership. If the leadership adopts a negligent and laissez-faire attitude towards rectification, and does not regard it as a solemn and major event of checking and summarizing work, improving work, and raising the level of policy thinking of cadres, and gives it to a few cadres to preside over, the result will inevitably not only fail to achieve the above-mentioned major goals of rectification, but may also lead to some ideological and organizational confusion and hinder the progress of cadres. If the leadership adopts a responsible attitude, cares about the cause of the Party, cares about the cause of the revolution, and cares about the progress of cadres, it will surely receive good results. For example, the inspiring report of checking and summarizing work must be made by the leading comrades themselves, and only the leading comrades can do it well. As long as the leadership can seriously make this kind of inspiring report of checking and summarizing work, it will be of great help to helping cadres specifically understand the overall situation, understand policies, improve understanding, and launch correct criticism and self-criticism. In the entire process of rectification, it is also very important for the leadership to closely grasp the ideological situation of cadres and promptly guide them, so the issue of leadership is a decisive issue.

　　检查总结半年来的主要工作
    西南各省整风即将结束
    认为任务与政策矛盾的观点开始改变
    剿匪工作中过于宽大或单纯军事进剿的偏向已纠正
    【本报讯】西南区的整风运动，依据中共中央及西南局关于整风指示的精神，从六月中旬西南大行政区一级机关开始，到各省区普遍展开大规模的整风运动，历时已三个多月，估计不久即可全部结束。方式上除一般的在本机关进行整风外，各省区均首先集中县以上主要干部整风。川东、川西、西康曾用整风会议形式。云南、贵州、川北采取党代表会议形式。川南区党委用召开扩大干部会议的办法。县级以上的集中整风时间，大都在半个月左右即结束。此后即采取整风会议或由上而下的轮训班形式，继续深入整风运动，完成县以下一般干部的整风。无论何种形式，都是通过阅读文件、听取负责同志的工作总结报告，检查总结工作等步骤，和发扬民主，正确的开展批评与自我批评等方式，批判了工作中的官僚主义、命令主义及关门主义。
    这次整风的特点和经验是：各地一般的都注意到密切联系当前实际工作。以检查西南解放后半年来的工作为主，分析情况，展开批评与自我批评，肯定工作中的成绩，批判缺点和错误，不是漫无目标的整风和个人一般的思想反省，而是由上而下的逐级检查，总结工作，吸收经验，检查政策的执行情况，达到改进工作，提高政策思想水平的目的。例如各地区在检查工作中，发现一个带普遍性的问题，就是不少的干部思想上存在着“既要完成任务，就不能执行政策”，或“按政策办事就不能完成任务”，及“任务紧急就不能不采用强迫命令手段”等糊涂观点。经过深入讨论和展开批评与自我批评，最后大家终于认识了政策与任务的一致性。而且他们已从实际征粮的事实中得到证明，即那些所谓“不管政策不政策，只要完成任务就是好的”的思想，及惯于简单生硬，强迫命令，以至吊人打人的那一套办法，并不能真正完成任务；相反的，那些并不靠吊人打人强迫命令而善于运用政策，组织各方的力量的地区，倒完成任务更好更早。又例如有的地区检查出在救灾工作中，由于缺乏调查研究，平均分配贷粮，有的甚至贷给地主，造成极坏的影响。说明了因为官僚主义、命令主义，以致脱离了党与人民政府的政策的危害性。在剿匪问题上，不少地区检查出在进入西南以后的剿匪初期，由于对于西南地区土匪的政治性与危害性及广大群众思想缺乏具体而正确的分析，由于害怕“左”，害怕多杀了人，结果采取了“宽大无边”（即只有宽大没有镇压），或只单纯以军事进剿没有政治争取的片面政策，而脱离了广大群众，后来迅速的纠正了此种政策，采取了宽大与镇压相结合的政策，剿匪得到了重大的胜利，取得了群众热烈的拥护。这种从实际出发，以检查总结工作为主的整风，对于改进干部工作，提高干部政策思想水平是非常有益的。
    其次，由于我党在历史上的两次整风中，个别地区、个别部门中，对于个别党员干部曾有某些偏向的影响，又由于西南整风以前一个时期曾经单纯强调批评与自我批评等，不少的干部是带着若干疑惧来进行整风的。因此，在整风的初期，差不多都首先要经过一段打消他们对于整风疑惧和顾虑的工作，然后才能顺利的导入正轨。但由于我们这次的整风不是泛泛的检查思想，而是着重于检查总结工作，分析情况，研究政策，尤其领导人带头作工作检查总结的启发报告，首先帮助一般干部提高了认识，结果，干部的疑惧和顾虑，很快得到消除，不但不再畏惧整风，反而感到整风的愉快，觉得“整风对工作对思想有很大帮助，今后多来几次才好。”并感到整风时间太短了。这次整风，不但没有伤害干部的积极性，反而启发了干部的自觉，加增了他们今后工作的信心。
    最后，整风是否能达到检查总结工作，改进工作，提高干部政策思想水平的目的，是否会走弯路，是否会迅速导入正轨，关键问题在于领导。领导上对于整风，如果采取轻视放任的态度，不把它看成是一件检查总结工作，改进工作，提高干部政策思想水平的庄严的重大事件，加以切实认真的领导，而看成是一种普通的学习，委之于少数干部去主持，其结果必然不但不能达到上述整风的重大目的，反而可能招致思想上组织上的某些混乱，阻碍干部的进步。领导上如果采取认真负责的态度，关心党的事业，关心革命的事业，关心干部的进步，就一定会收到良好的效果。例如检查总结工作的启发报告，领导同志必须自己作，而且只有领导同志才可能作好。只要领导上能认真的作好此种检查总结工作的启发报告，对于帮助干部具体了解全般情况，了解政策，提高认识，展开正确的批评与自我批评，就有极大作用。在整风全部过程中，领导上密切掌握干部思想情况，及时加以诱导，对于完成整风也十分重要，所以领导的问题，是带决定性的问题。
