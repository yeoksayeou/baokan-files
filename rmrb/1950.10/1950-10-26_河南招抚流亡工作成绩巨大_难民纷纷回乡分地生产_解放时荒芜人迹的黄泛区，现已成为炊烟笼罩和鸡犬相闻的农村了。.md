Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 24th: Since liberation, especially during the land reform this spring, the Henan Provincial People's Government has recruited and rehabilitated a large number of farmers who had fled famine, allowing them to return to their hometowns to receive land and settle down for production. According to statistics from only six counties, namely Xuchang, Changge, Yanling, Wuyang, Yancheng, and Linying: during the land reform this spring, more than 46,000 farmers returned home to receive land. These refugees, who had been scattered in all directions and homeless for many years, rebuilt their homes with the help of the People's Government and local villagers, and also received the same share of land and means of production as other farmers during the land reform. This spring, the Yanling County People's Government issued loans to more than 300 returning refugee households in Quzhuang District, which was enough to buy 200 head of cattle. In April and May of this year, farmers in Yancheng County helped returning refugees build more than 1,300 houses. Now, after the two seasons of bumper harvests in summer and autumn, these refugees have been able to independently solve their own difficulties; many are buying cattle and farm tools together after the autumn harvest. The seven returning refugee households in Jiangzhuang, Wuyang County, now have one cow per household. Among them, Jiang Zhenkui and other five households, who had been begging for food for many years, have now sent their children to school.
　　Before liberation, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang's conscription and grain requisition in Henan Province, many farmers were ruined and fled their homes. In 1938, when Chiang Kai-shek breached the Huayuankou levee of the Yellow River in front of the Japanese invaders, the homes of millions of farmers in eastern Henan were submerged by the Yellow River. After liberation, the Henan Provincial People's Government immediately vigorously recruited famine refugees to return home and resume production. During the land reform, the People's Government conducted detailed investigations and registrations of fugitive households in various places, and also organized relatives and friends of the refugees to inquire about their whereabouts in all directions, write letters to the refugees, and call on them to return home to receive land. Even if the refugees had not all returned home at the time of land distribution, appropriate land was reserved for them. The Henan refugees, who had been displaced for a long time, were all overjoyed and returned to their hometowns one after another. The Yellow River flood area, which was still desolate and uninhabited at the time of liberation, has now become a rural area with rising smoke and the sounds of chickens and dogs.

　　河南招抚流亡工作成绩巨大
    难民纷纷回乡分地生产 
    解放时荒芜人迹的黄泛区，现已成为炊烟笼罩和鸡犬相闻的农村了。
    【新华社开封二十四日电】解放以来特别是在今春土地改革时，河南省人民政府招抚了大批逃荒在外的农民返乡分田，安家生产。仅据许昌、长葛、鄢陵、舞阳、郾城、临颍六县统计：今春土地改革时，还乡分田的农民即达四万六千多人。这些多年来逃散四方无家可归的难民，在人民政府和当地乡亲的帮助下重建家园，又在土地改革中和其他农民分得了同样的一份土地和生产资料。鄢陵县人民政府今春给该县屈庄区三百多户还乡难民所发放的贷款，足可买二百头耕牛。郾城县农民在今年四、五两个月中，帮助还乡难民修建的房屋就有一千三百多间。现在，这些难民经过夏秋两季丰收，他们已能独立解决自己的困难；秋收后合伙买耕牛农具的很多。舞阳县姜庄的七户还乡难民，现在每户有一头牛。其中在外讨饭多年的姜振魁等五户，现在都把自己的孩子送进了学校。
    解放以前，河南省在国民党抓丁要粮的反动统治下，农民家破人亡逃亡在外的非常多。一九三八年蒋介石在日寇进攻的前面掘开黄河花园口大堤时，豫东即有数百万农民的家园为黄水淹没。解放后，河南人民政府立即大力招抚逃荒农民还乡生产。土地改革时，人民政府一面对各地的逃亡户作详细的调查登记，一面更组织难民的亲友四出探问下落，给难民写信，号召回乡分地。即使分地时难民尚未全部还乡，也给留了适当的土地。长期颠沛流离的河南难民，无不欢欣鼓舞相率返里。解放时还荒芜人迹的黄泛区，现在又成为炊烟笼罩，鸡犬相闻的农村了。
