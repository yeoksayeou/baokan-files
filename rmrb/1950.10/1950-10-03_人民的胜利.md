　　The People's Victory
    Huashan
    Walking across the capital's grand square, from the magnificent Tiananmen towards the Exhibition of Achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, spending entire days in the huge palace buildings, thoroughly examining the precious historical relics and images of the revolutionary war – on the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, as a series of powerful national defense forces of the army, navy, and air force are displayed before us, no words on the venue are more inspiring than "The People's Victory." This is the inscription by our leader Mao Zedong. This magnified, glorious inscription in gold is not sculpted by an artist but condensed from the entire history of the Chinese revolutionary war. Displayed alongside the airplanes, tanks, artillery, warship models, and other modern imperialist weapons of aggression seized from the enemy are the rifles preserved since the Nanchang Uprising twenty-three years ago, as well as the spears and home-made guns of the Red Guards in the Jinggang Mountains era, and the wooden sticks used by the Young Pioneers to maintain revolutionary order. From the tens of thousands of historical relics, pictures, and photographs of the revolutionary war in the exhibition, we see the birth, development, and growth of the Chinese people's armed forces, and at the same time, we see the shameful failure of imperialist aggression on this land of China.

    In the three palaces of the Great High Hall, weapons from various historical periods of the People's Liberation Army are displayed. The Hanyang-made "Eighty-Eight" style rifle and carbine are typical weapons of the Ten-Year Land Revolution War era. During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the typical weapons were the "Type 38" rifles and carbines and light machine guns made by the Japanese invaders. During these eighteen years, the People's Liberation Army had very few artillery pieces and not many heavy machine guns. More common were homemade landmines, homemade guns, hand grenades, red-tasseled spears, and primitive weapons such as "elm cannons" made by hollowing out elm tree trunks. Although these primitive weapons varied in shape and were crude, they had one thing in common: they could all kill the enemy. Even a stone or an iron kettle embodied the people's wisdom in killing the enemy. By the time of the Liberation War, the weapons were very different: 155mm caliber US-made howitzers, the largest type of artillery the United States gave to Chiang Kai-shek; 15-ton US-made landing tanks; and rocket launchers, flamethrowers, and various combat vehicles... Among these 314 different exhibits, most were manufactured by various imperialist countries since World War I, with the largest number being products of US imperialism during World War II. These weapons, specifically designed to invade other people's territories, had been slaughtering the Chinese people for decades, killing from Nanchang to Guangzhou, from Hailufeng to the Jinggang Mountains, encircling and killing, chasing and killing, killing throughout China. But after twenty-three years of killing, these weapons have all been "killed" into the hands of the Chinese people.

    The Chinese people, who seized these weapons of aggression, not only created a brand-new people's country but also forged an invincible People's Liberation Army to defend the people's country. This is only because the criminals had taught the Chinese people as early as twenty-three years ago: to have peace, do not lay down your arms!

    This is what Chairman Mao instructed us: "In China, without armed struggle, there is no status for the proletariat, no status for the people, no status for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution." This instruction stands tall on the road leading to the Revolutionary War History Exhibition Hall on the Meridian Gate tower. Not far away is the instrument of torture used to strangle the revolutionary martyr Li Dazhao. In the exhibition hall, the first thing one sees is the crimes of the number one war criminal in China twenty-three years ago in slaughtering the Chinese people: "Chiang Kai-shek's order: Communist elements, once interrogated and confirmed, should be executed on the spot." This is a snippet of a Guangdong newspaper in 1927, "Two hundred youths executed by firing squad," workers were slaughtered, peasants were slaughtered, youths were slaughtered, and countless revolutionary people with bare hands were slaughtered. "But," as Chairman Mao said, "the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people were not intimidated or exterminated. They crawled up from the ground, wiped the blood from their bodies, buried the corpses of their comrades, and continued to fight." The Nanchang Uprising on August 1, 1927, as well as the Autumn Harvest Uprising and the Guangzhou Uprising at the same time, were the continued high-raising of the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism by the revolutionary people who had not been exterminated, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Ye Ting and He Long, pushing the Chinese revolution to a new stage of armed struggle. China saw its first people's power – the people's power in Hailufeng and Guangzhou. Although it suffered defeat under the crazy suppression of the powerful reactionaries, and the famous worker leader Su Zhaozheng and peasant leader Peng Pai were killed, the people never laid down their arms. Even now, in the exhibition hall, we can still see the blood-stained clothes of the revolutionary people of Hailufeng, riddled with bullet holes, the membership cards of the peasant associations, and the relics of the revolutionary movement at that time, including many precious photographs taken at the time. We can see: how the old mother of the martyr Peng Pai educated the descendants who had not been exterminated, pointing to the place where the first Chinese people's power had appeared. Even Wang Fengfei, a revolutionary fighter who persisted in underground work in the suburbs of the city with the late Red Army General Fang Zhimin after the failure of the Nanchang Uprising, still refused to abandon his weapons when it was no longer possible to hide in the local area. He had his sister-in-law bury a pistol and two rifles from the uprising underground until Nanchang was liberated last year. Although the gun handle has now rotted away completely, the rusty barrel is still full of backbone, forever telling future generations what the "August 1st" gun means. The exhibition features gifts from Comrade Peng Pai's old mother to the People's Liberation Army. She said, "I knew that the Kuomintang could not kill all the Chinese people, and the people would surely win. I have been looking forward to it for twenty-two years, and I have personally seen my own troops return." The earliest group of People's Liberation Army who joined forces in the Jinggang Mountains was precisely such a heroic and tenacious revolutionary army. Under the personal cultivation of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, it went through the Ten-Year Land Revolution War and the Eight-Year War of Resistance Against Japan, had smashed Chiang Kai-shek's five encirclement and suppression campaigns, completed the 25,000-li Long March, and defeated a powerful Japanese imperialism. These eighteen years of fighting were all tenaciously persisted in amid the encirclement and suppression by domestic and foreign counter-revolutionary armed forces with superior equipment and numbers.

    However, without a correct military line, even if one is merely heroic, tenacious, and infinitely loyal to the people, it is still impossible to defeat the enemy. During the dark days of Chiang Kai-shek's all-out offensive against the Liberated Areas, I will never forget the complaints of an old woman on the retreat road: "I have two great regrets in my life," she said, "one is that the Kuomintang is attacking, and the other is that the Communist Party is retreating." Some soldiers could not endure the emotional torment and set up machine guns on the ground and refused to leave: "You retreat! I will die here and fight a Kuomintang company to the death!" But what the Chinese people wanted to fight to the death was not just a company, but Chiang Kai-shek's entire reactionary ruling apparatus. At that time, the enemy not only had 4.3 million troops but also received 5.9 billion US dollars in military aid from the United States, with as many as 45 divisions equipped with American weapons alone. Ninety thousand US Marines even cooperated with or independently invaded the Liberated Areas up to 30 times. Not fixated on the gains and losses of a single city or place, but actively eliminating the enemy's active forces, under this unwavering military guiding principle, the people abandoned 141 cities such as Zhangjiakou and Yan'an in the first year of the Liberation War. How proud the enemy was at that time! "Completely eliminate the Communist army in three to six months!" "Haven't met an opponent in the Northeast yet!" "Drive the Communist army to the Changbai Mountains to eat rocks!" ... Just after taking Zhangjiakou, Chiang Kai-shek was busy opening the puppet National Assembly the next day, becoming a puppet president. On the front lines of the civil war, the so-called "ace" of Chiang's army, the American-equipped "Number One Army Under Heaven," a company even dared to attack alone for dozens of miles, and a jeep even dared to drive 30 to 50 miles to catch chickens. Just as the enemy was elated, the People's Liberation Army fought a series of annihilation battles, winning seven battles and seven victories in northern Jiangsu, attacking the Longhai Line. After initially mobilizing the masses in the Northeast, they also began to launch three offensives across the Songhua River in the severe cold of minus forty degrees, and four defenses of Linjiang, followed by a full-scale summer offensive.

    After the enemy was forced to abandon the all-out offensive, the East China People's Liberation Army smashed the enemy's key offensive of sixty brigades against Shandong with seven consecutive annihilation battles over three months. The Northwest People's Liberation Army, which was far smaller in number than the enemy, also smashed another key offensive of the enemy's fifteen brigades with five months of continuous operations without rest. -- "Concentrate absolute superior forces, strive for complete annihilation!" To realize Chairman Mao's instruction, it was impossible without the steadfast and tenacious combat style of all commanders and fighters. "Fight bravely, fear no sacrifice, fear no fatigue and continuous operations, and do not give the enemy a chance to breathe!" In the darkest first year of the Liberation War, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army realized Chairman Mao's guiding principle with superhuman physical endurance, "Go wherever the superiors point!" "Fight to the death, extinguish the enemy's ferocity, and 'eat' up the enemy's active forces!" The soldiers who continued the glorious tradition of the Red Army annihilated 1.12 million enemy troops in continuous mobile warfare that they had never experienced before, ushering in the offensive stage on a national scale in the second year. Liu and Deng's army leaped thousands of miles into the Dabie Mountains, crossed the river, crossed the Longhai Line, and inserted a sharp knife into the reactionary ruling heartland between Nanjing and Wuhan, heroically attracting a large force of 33 enemy brigades. Chen Xie's and Chen Su's armies also launched full-scale offensives. The three armies opened up new battlefields in the vast areas of the Central Plains south of the Yellow River and north of the Yangtze River, leading the war into the enemy's controlled areas. The internal battlefields also launched offensives one after another, annihilating another 1.52 million enemy troops and liberating 164 cities, laying the foundation for the decisive battle to smash the main force of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary army in the third year.

    A series of new victories posed a series of new problems for the People's Liberation Army: more weapons were captured, and it was no longer enough to only know how to use rifles and hand grenades; large cities required artillery and tanks, and without gunners, even with American artillery, it was impossible to establish a powerful people's artillery; the front lines had penetrated deep into the enemy's heartland, how to supply the front without trains and cars?... Modern large-scale regularized offensive operations were the last problem of the Chinese revolutionary war, a new problem of transitioning from the countryside to seizing large cities. In the past, when fighting guerrilla warfare, the company commander only needed to say, "First platoon to the left, second platoon to the right, third platoon follow me!" – a brave commander was a good commander. Now, when a company fights in street battles, a company commander has to command the submachine gun team, the hand grenade team, the demolition team, the bayonet team, and the firepower team of light and heavy machine guns and 60mm mortars, and has to control the first assault team and also the second and third assault teams, and also has to closely contact the artillery and closely coordinate with neighboring companies... Being a regimental or divisional commander is even more complex and difficult. -- "Master modern technology, learn large-scale regular operations!" The first People's Artillery in the Northeast organized its first heavy artillery regiment by searching for scattered enemy artillery that had been dismantled in the mountains on the Soviet anti-"defense line" abandoned by the Japanese invaders, and through sixty consecutive days and nights of intense work in the deep snow of the severe winter in northern Manchuria. Then they groped to operate and fire, – farmers-turned-soldiers who came from cattle herding backgrounds thus became excellent sharpshooters, creating the miracle of seven out of seven hits, with each shot hitting the enemy's stronghold from the same hole in the four-year offensive campaign. The railway corps shouted the slogan "Where the army fights, the railway will be built" and extended the railway to the city of Jinzhou during the battle. Later, following the million-strong army that surged into the pass, the railway was extended to Pingjin... And following the army that crossed the Yangtze River, repaired the Ping-Hu line that had been cut off for twelve years... From the Changbai Mountains to the Pearl River, from the East China Sea to the Northwest Plateau, the national railways were completely repaired in two years. In the large-scale offensive battles to capture cities, the People's Liberation Army also produced batches of heroic commanders like Liu Meicun, who led an assault company in the offensive battle of Siping and organized five offensive battles in four consecutive days and nights of street fighting, attacking the enemy's military core fortifications directly from the edge of the city, fighting until 133 of the 134 men in the entire company were wounded or killed. In the last battle, he was already covered with more than a dozen wounds and had only five wounded soldiers who could fight beside him. In the chaos of the fire in the building, he was still able to maintain the calmness and decisiveness that a commander should have, dividing the five soldiers into two groups, controlling a hall and a building respectively, creating the feat of a company capturing five key points occupied by two battalions and two companies of the enemy in one go.

    "Learn whatever tactics are needed for the battle to be fought; learn whatever skills are needed for the weapons captured!" In this way, the People's Liberation Army quickly learned offensive tactics in the battle to capture cities. Even the North China Corps, which lacked artillery at the time, was able to capture Shijiazhuang, an important town in North China, in six days. Commander-in-Chief Zhu's poem about the Battle of Shimen says: "From now on, I will not worry about graying hair." From the exhibition halls of the second and third years of the Liberation War, we can see that the People's Liberation Army had already developed a fairly complete set of offensive tactics and experience in the battles of Luoyang, Kaifeng, Siping, and Jinan, and the enemy's so-called "unbeatable" key defenses were no longer effective.

    The Liaoshen Campaign in the Northeast, which achieved the great victory of the People's Liberation War, was launched on the basis of the maturity of the People's Liberation Army's experience in both mobile warfare and offensive warfare. Starting on September 12, 1948, the Northeast People's Liberation Army liberated the three major cities of Jinzhou, Changchun, and Shenyang in just 52 days, completely annihilating 470,000 Chiang's troops in the Northeast. Then, the Huaihai Campaign, which began on November 7, annihilated 555,000 enemy troops, the main force in Central China, in 68 days, achieving another decisive victory in the Liberation War. The Pingjin Campaign, which began on December 2, also solved the main force of the enemy in North China, 520,000 troops, in 56 days, achieving the third decisive victory in the Liberation War.

    These three major campaigns eliminated all the elite troops of the enemy and won the basic victory of the Chinese revolution. However, at the beginning of the campaigns, the People's Liberation Army did not have an absolute advantage in terms of troop strength on the battlefield. On the Huaihai battlefield, it was almost equal. To achieve an absolute advantage in completely annihilating the enemy in a large-scale battle where the strength was evenly matched, this was a duel, a duel in which both sides wanted to gain an advantage and overwhelm the other in the battle. "Concentrate absolutely superior forces in each battle, surround on all sides, strive for complete annihilation, and do not let anyone escape," Chairman Mao's brilliant military guiding principle was brilliantly realized by the people's heroic spirit that overwhelms everything. When the People's Liberation Army concentrated superior forces under the city of Jinzhou and decided to first cut off the advance and retreat routes of the 470,000 Chiang's troops in the Northeast, Chiang Kai-shek personally arranged a pincer attack to reinforce Jinzhou. Twelve divisions came out from Shenyang in the east, and nine divisions were transferred from within the pass in the west, and there were still 100,000 enemies in the city. The main force of the People's Liberation Army gathered under the city of Jinzhou was about to lose its advantage. At this critical moment, the heroic troops guarding Tashan bravely stepped forward to resist, fighting hand-to-hand with the enemy every day for half a month, blocking the enemy, who was three times their number, more than 40 li away from Jinzhou. Even if the position was bombed into scorched earth, even if there were only four wounded riflemen left, they had to repel the attack of an entire enemy battalion. "It doesn't matter if we are all wiped out," the soldiers said with confidence during the fierce battle, "anyway, Jinzhou must be captured, and the enemy in the Northeast must be finished this time." The people's soldiers won the advantage of the main force attacking Jinzhou with this kind of confidence that despised everything. As a result, the 100,000 enemies in Jinzhou were completely annihilated within 31 hours, and the People's Liberation Army immediately freed up the iron fist of the main force from Jinzhou and swung it to western Liaoning, completely annihilating Liao Yaoxiang's American-equipped corps, which had been cultivated by US imperialism. The million-strong army was then freed from the Northeast and surged into the pass, creating the advantage of achieving a complete victory in the Pingjin Campaign. Especially on the Huaihai battlefield, in order to concentrate superior forces in mobile warfare, and take advantage of the fact that the enemy forces had not been able to support each other, and quickly encircle and annihilate them one by one, in order to free up more forces to invest in the next encirclement battle, the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army displayed a high degree of tenacity and tenacious hard-fighting spirit. As General Liu Bocheng said in the battle mobilization, "Even if the Second Field Army is wiped out, the Chinese revolution will win immediately, and the enemy only has these 600,000 main forces left!" The leaders of the Chen Xie Corps also took up rifles, and non-combat personnel in the headquarters, political department, and other organs were ready to join the battle at any time. Even if it was just to increase that small bit of advantage to a corner of the battlefield, everyone who could shoot a gun would find one, and the medics on the front line could not bear to let the injured soldiers' guns lie idle during the gaps between bandaging them. Finally, they fought six annihilation battles in a row for 68 consecutive days, liberating vast areas north of the Yangtze River. In the following year, the million-strong army crossed the Yangtze River, and the great advances of various armies to liberate the entire mainland were rapidly launched on this basis.

    Destroying 8.07 million enemy troops, capturing more than 54,000 artillery pieces of various types, nearly 320,000 machine guns of various types, 228 flamethrowers, 189 aircraft, 200 ships, 622 tanks, 389 armored vehicles, and more than 20,000 vehicles - this is the main achievement of the four-year Liberation War. When the Kuomintang's 22 years of reactionary rule were shattered, the Chinese people not only created a brand-new people's country but also forged a powerful modern national defense force with the army, navy, and air force. The weapons displayed at the arms exhibition, from the pen pistol of American spies to the 155mm caliber US-made howitzer, from the assassination cane gun to the landing amphibious tank that the Americans prepared to cross the ocean and climb onto other people's territories, from the German howitzer manufactured during World War I to the flamethrower that the United States gave to Chiang Kai-shek after World War II, include German, Japanese, Italian, British, French, Austrian, Czech, and the most numerous are American. These imperialist warmongers who like to take guns and cannons to foreign countries to kill people, their weapons have sucked the blood of countless Chinese people for decades. When these weapons have become a powerful force for defending world peace in the hands of the Chinese people today, the war criminals who manufactured these weapons, such as the German, Japanese, and Italian fascists, have been shamefully destroyed from the world; the Czech Republic and Austria have become peaceful people's countries; and even the American warmongers who like to play with fire in Asia have rolled out of mainland China together with Chiang Kai-shek, whom they encouraged and supported.

    War criminals will be punished with whatever weapons they use to kill people; once weapons of aggression fall into the hands of the people, they will immediately become a force for peace to stop aggression. This is what the entire history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has proven. The young company commander who was watching the amphibious landing vehicle exhibit had fought guerrilla warfare for seven years during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Two years ago, after his unit captured four American tanks, he learned to drive a car in six hours and learned to drive a tank in one hour, and then immediately drove the tank into the city of Jinan. Later, in the Huaihai Campaign, he also drove an American tank and fought against the enemy equipped with American weapons. After capturing an American landing tank in Shanghai, he groped and learned to become a skilled driver. If the people have the ability to seize it, they have the ability to learn how to use it. This is the case with artillery, tanks, and warships and aircraft as well. In the battle to liberate the Wanshan Islands, the young people's gunboats such as the "Pioneer" sank four enemy ships. When the gunboat "Struggle" encountered an enemy gunboat twice its size, it bravely and skillfully fought the enemy ship within 50 meters, injuring it. After the gunner was wounded, he replaced the sacrificed driver to steer the ship. The glorious tradition of bravery and tenacity of the People's Liberation Army began to appear in the People's Navy. It can be seen from the photos that they not only repaired the Jiangnan Shipyard that had been bombed by Chiang's aircraft, rescued the sunken ships, but also were concentrating on practicing landing on Taiwan, practicing transporting landing tanks to cover their landing in front of the enemy. The young people's air force is also the same. Judging from their creation of the highest national parachuting record and the completion of the great achievement of high-altitude long-distance airdrops, the Red Army tradition of Jinggang Mountain has also begun to shine in the young air force. When the flames of imperialist aggression are burning in Korea and Vietnam, and the unscrupulous flames are baking the northeastern and southwestern borders of the motherland, when that American imperialism, which rolled out of mainland China, is playing with fire again in the skies and seas of the motherland, the exhibition hall of the air force and navy is particularly exciting. Although they still seem very young compared to the magnificent exhibition hall of the army's achievements. But one thing is certain: if the people have the ability to seize new weapons from the enemy, they have the ability to learn and master new technologies. Moreover, when they appear on the front line of liberating Taiwan, we can see not only new technologies but also the invincible combat style of this new technology. (Attached pictures)

　　人民的胜利
    华山
    穿过首都的大广场，从气势磅礴的天安门走向中国人民解放军战绩展览会，整日在巨大的宫廷建筑物里，纵览着革命战争的珍贵历史文物和图片，——在中华人民共和国诞生的第一个周年，当我们面前展现着一系列的陆海空军的强大国防力量的时候，会场上再没有比“人民的胜利”这行字更加令人振奋的了。这是我们的领袖毛泽东的题字。这行放大了的辉煌金字不是艺术家塑成而是全部中国革命战争史凝聚成的。和夺自敌人的飞机，坦克，大炮，军舰模型等等帝国主义现代化侵略武器同时陈列着的，是二十三年前南昌起义时代保存至今的步枪，以及井岗山时代赤卫军的矛子，枱枪，和少年先锋队维持革命秩序的木棍。从展览会上成万件的革命战争历史文物，和图画照片，我们看到了中国人民武装力量诞生，发展，壮大的过程，同时，也看到了帝国主义的侵略在中国这块土地上可耻失败的过程。
    在大高殿的三座宫廷里，陈列着解放军各个历史时期的兵器。汉阳造的“八八”式步枪和马枪，这是十年土地革命战争时代的典型武器。在八年抗日战争时期，典型的武器是日寇制造的“三八”式步马枪和轻机枪。在这十八年中，解放军只有极少的炮和不多的重机枪。更多的是土造的地雷，土枪，手榴弹，红缨枪，以及用榆木树杆掏空做成的“榆木炮”之类的原始兵器。这些原始武器尽管形形色色，粗糙不一，有一点却是共同的：都能打死敌人。即使是一块石头或者一把铁壶，也凝结着人民的杀敌智慧。到了解放战争时期，武器就大不相同了：口径一五五公厘的美造榴弹炮，这是美国送给蒋介石最大的一种炮。十五吨重的美造登陆坦克，还有火箭炮，火焰喷射器，各种战车。……在这三百一十四种不同的陈列品里，大多数是第一次世界大战以来各个帝国主义国家所制造的，最多的则是美帝国主义在第二次世界大战时期的出品。这些专门用来侵略旁人国土的武器，几十年来一直屠杀着中国人民，从南昌杀到广州，从海陆丰杀到井岗山，围着杀，追着杀，杀遍了整个中国。可是杀了二十三年以后，这些武器却统统“杀”到中国人民的手里了。
    夺取了这些侵略武器的中国人民，不仅打出了一个崭新的人民国家，而且打出了一支保卫人民国家的无敌解放军。这只是因为罪犯们早在二十三年以前，就教育了中国人民：要和平就不要放下武器！
    这就是毛主席指示我们的：“在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”这个指示，耸立在通往午门楼上革命战史陈列室的路上。不远处正是一座绞杀革命先烈李大钊同志的刑具。在陈列室里，首先看到的，也是二十三年前中国第一号战争罪犯屠杀中国人民的罪迹：“蒋介石手令：共党分子一经讯实，立地正法”，这是一九二七年广东报纸的点滴记载，“二百青年遭枪决”，工人被屠杀，农民被屠杀，青年被屠杀，无数赤手空拳的革命人民被屠杀。“但是”，正是毛主席说的：“中国共产党和中国人民并没有被吓倒，被杀绝。他们从地下爬起来，揩干净身上的血迹，掩埋好同伴的尸首，他们又继续战斗了。”一九二七年八月一日的南昌起义，以及同时的秋收起义，广州起义，就是毛主席，朱总司令和叶挺，贺龙领导下的没被杀绝的革命人民，继续高举起反帝反封建的大旗，把中国革命推向武装斗争的新阶段。中国出现了第一个人民政权——海陆丰和广州的人民政权。虽然在强大的反动派疯狂镇压下遭到失败了，著名的工人领袖苏兆征和农民领袖彭湃被杀死了，但是人民从此没有放下武器。直到现在，我们在展览室里还可以看到海陆丰革命人民保存下来的挂满弹痕的血衣，看到农民协会的会员证和当时革命运动的遗物，包括许多当时摄下的珍贵照片。我们可以看到：先烈彭湃的老母亲是怎样指着第一个中国人民政权在那里出现过的地方，教育着没被杀绝的后代。甚至在南昌起义失败后的革命战士，和已故的红军名将方志敏一起在市郊坚持地下工作的王凤飞同志，直到当地无法藏身，仍然不肯抛掉武器，他让嫂嫂把起义的一支手枪和两枝步枪埋在地下，直到去年南昌解放。虽然现在枪柄已经腐烂尽净，满是铁锈的枪筒还是那样骨气凛然，永远告诉后代什么叫做“八一”的枪。展览会上陈列着彭湃同志的老母亲送给解放军的礼品，她说：“我知道国民党杀不完中国人民的，人民一定胜利的。我整整盼望了二十二年，又亲眼看见自己的队伍回来了。”在井岗山会师的最早一批人民解放军，正是这样一支英勇顽强的革命军队，它在毛主席朱总司令亲手培养下，经过了十年土地革命战争和八年抗日战争，曾经粉碎过蒋介石的五次围剿，完成了二万五千里长征，打败了一个强大的日本帝国主义。这十八年的战斗都是在装备优良的数量上占优势的国内外反革命武装包围进剿中顽强坚持过来的。
    但是，如果离开了正确的军事路线，仅仅英勇顽强和对人民的无限忠诚还是不能战胜敌人的。在蒋介石全面进攻解放区的黑暗日子里，我永远忘不了撤退道路上一个老太婆的怨言：“我生平有两大恨”，她说，“一恨国民党进攻，二恨共产党撤退。”有的战士无法忍受感情的折磨，在地上架起机枪就不走了：“你们撤退吧！我死在这里也要拚掉国民党一个连！”但是中国人民要拚掉的不是一个连而是蒋介石的整个反动统治机构。而当时敌人不仅拥有四百三十万兵力，而且获得了美国五十九万万美元的军事援助，仅仅美械化的部队就有四十五个师。九万美军陆战队甚至配合蒋匪或单独进犯过解放军达三十次。不在一城一地得失，主动消灭敌人有生力量，在这坚定不移的军事指导原则下，人民在解放战争的第一年放弃了张家口、延安等一百四十一座城市。当时敌人好得意啊！“三个月至六个月全部消灭共军！”“在东北还没碰到个对手！”“把共军撵到长白山上吃石头！”……刚刚拿下张家口，第二天蒋介石就忙着开伪国大了，当起伪总统来了，而在内战前线所谓蒋军“王牌”的美械化“天下第一军”，一个连竟然敢单独进击几十里，一辆吉普车，也敢开出三五十里抓鸡吃。正在敌人兴高采烈的时候，人民解放军打了一连串的歼灭战，苏北七战七捷，出击陇海线，东北在初步发动群众以后，也开始在零下四十度的严寒中三次出击松花江南，四次保卫临江，紧接着又展开了全线出击的夏季攻势。
    打得敌人被迫放弃了全面进攻以后，华东解放军又以连续三个月的七次歼灭战粉碎了敌人对山东的六十个旅的重点进攻，数量上大大少于敌军的西北解放军，也以不稍间息的五个月的连续作战，粉碎了敌人十五个旅的另一个重点进攻。——“集中绝对优势兵力，力求全歼！”要实现毛主席的这一指示，没有全体指战员坚忍顽强的战斗作风是不可能的。“勇敢战斗，不怕牺牲，不怕疲劳与连续作战，不让敌人喘息！”就在最黑暗的解放战争第一年中，解放军战士们用超人的肉体坚忍实现了毛主席的这一指导原则，“上级指到哪里就打到哪里！”“死打硬拚，拚掉敌人凶焰，‘吃’掉敌人有生力量！”继续了红军光荣传统的战士们，就在从未经历过的连续运动战中歼灭了敌军一百一十二万人，打出了第二年全国规模的进攻阶段。千里跃进大别山，刘邓大军渡河，越陇海，向南京武汉间的反动统治心脏插进一把尖刀，英勇地吸引住敌人三十三个旅的大量兵力，陈谢，陈粟两路大军也全线出击。三路大军开辟了黄河以南，长江以北的中原广大地区的新战场，把战争引向敌人统治区。各内线战场，也先后出击，总计又歼灭了敌人一百五十二万人，解放一百六十四座城市，给第三年粉碎蒋介石反动军队主力的大决战奠定了胜利的基础。
    一连串的新胜利向人民解放军提出了一连串的新问题：缴获的武器多了，光会用步枪手榴弹不行了；打大城市要大炮坦克，有美国炮没有炮手还是建立不起强大的人民炮兵；战线深入敌人腹心地区了，没有火车汽车怎样供应前方？……现代化的大兵团正规化攻坚作战，这是中国革命战争的最后一个问题，是从农村转向夺取大城市的新问题。过去打游击，连长只要说声：“一排向左，二排向右，三排跟我冲啊！”——勇敢的指挥员就是漂亮的指挥员。现在，一个连打巷战，一个连长就要指挥冲锋枪组，手榴弹组，爆炸组，刺刀组，轻重机枪六○炮的火力组，要掌握第一突击队还要掌握第二第三突击队，还要密切联系炮兵，密切配合友邻连队，……当个团长师长更复杂，更困难了。——“掌握现代技术，学会大兵团正规作战！”东北最初的人民炮兵，就是在日寇遗弃的反苏“国防线”上，在北满严冬的深雪里搜掘山中拆毁了的零散敌炮，以连续六十昼夜的紧张工作组织起第一个重炮团。然后又摸索着操纵，摸索着发射，——放牛孩子出身的农民战士们就这样地变成了出色的神炮手，在四年攻坚战中出现了七发七中，而且炮炮都从一个洞打进敌据点的奇迹。前线需要大量弹药物资，铁道兵团就喊出“大军打到那里，铁道修到那里”的响亮口号，把铁路延伸到大战中的锦州城下。以后又跟着汹涌进关的百万大军，把铁路延伸到平津，……又跟着横渡长江天险，直捣蒋匪巢穴的大军修复了断绝十二年的平沪一线。……从长白山到珠江，从东海到西北高原，在两年中把全国铁路完全修通了。而在夺取城市的大规模攻坚战中，解放军也出现了一批批像刘梅村这样的英雄指挥员，他在四平攻坚战中曾经带领一个突击连队，在连续四昼夜的巷战中组织了五次攻坚战斗，从城边直捣守敌的军部核心工事，一直打到全连一百三十四个人伤亡了一百三十三个，最后一次他已经打得浑身十几处伤，身旁也只剩五个可以作战的伤员了，在满楼大火的混战中他仍能保持着指挥员应有的清醒和果决，把五个战士分成两组，分别控制一座大厅和一间楼房，创造了一个连一气夺取敌人一个团两个营和两个连踞守着的五个要点的战绩。
    “要打什么仗，就学什么战术；缴到什么武器，就学什么本事！”解放军就这样地，在夺取城市的战斗中迅速学会了攻坚战术。就是当时炮兵比较缺乏的华北兵团，也能在六天中攻克华北重镇石家庄了。朱总司令咏石门战役的诗说：“从此不虑鬓毛斑。”我们从解放战争第二三年的陈列室里，可以看到人民解放军在洛阳、开封、四平、济南等战役中已经锻炼出一套相当完整的攻坚战术和经验，敌人所谓“吃不掉”“啃不烂”的重点防御也不灵了。
    取得人民解放战争伟大胜利的东北辽沈战役，就是在解放军的运动战和攻坚战的经验都已成熟的基础上展开的。从一九四八年的九月十二日开始，东北解放军仅仅在五十二天中，便解放了锦州、长春、沈阳三大城市，全歼东北蒋军四十七万人。接着，十一月七日开始的淮海战役又以六十八天歼灭敌华中主力五十五万五千人，取得了解放战争又一个决定性的胜利。十二月二日开始的平津张战役，也以五十六天解决了华北敌主力五十二万人，取得了解放战争的第三个决定性的胜利。
    这三大战役，打掉了敌人所有的精锐部队，赢得了中国革命的基本胜利。可是战役开始之初，解放军在战场上的兵力并非都占绝对优势。在淮海战场上甚至几乎相等。要在势均力敌的大会战中，打出一个全歼敌人的绝对优势来，这是一场决斗，是敌我双方都想在会战中赢得优势，压倒对方的决斗。“每战集中绝对优势兵力，四面包围，力求全歼，不使漏网”，毛主席的英明军事指导原则，正是战士们压倒一切的人民英雄气概所光辉实现的。当解放军集中优势兵力于锦州城下，决定首先切断东北四十七万蒋军的进关退路时，蒋介石亲自布置了一个夹击增援的“锦州大决战”。东面由沈阳出来十二个师，西面从关内调来九个师，城内还摆着十万敌人。云集锦州城下的解放军主力眼看失去优势。就在这紧急关头，扼守塔山的英雄部队勇敢地挺身抗击，一连半个月，每天都在和敌人肉搏拚杀，把三倍于己的敌人阻挡在锦州四十华里以外，那怕阵地被轰成焦土，仅剩的四个负伤的步枪兵，也要打退整营敌人的攻击。“咱们拚光了，也不要紧”，苦战中战士们满怀信心说，“反正锦州一定要打下，东北敌人这次一定要完了。”人民战士就是用这种藐视一切的信心，赢得了攻锦主力的优势。于是，锦州十万敌人在三十一小时内悉数被歼，解放军马上又从锦州腾出主力的铁拳，抡到辽西，全歼美帝国主义培养起来的廖耀湘美械化兵团。又从东北腾出百万雄师，汹涌进关，造成了取得平津张战役全胜的优势。特别是淮海战场，为了在运动中集中优势兵力，趁着各路敌军未能互相呼应之先，迅速予以各个围歼，以便腾出更多兵力投入下一个围歼战，解放军指战员们发扬了高度坚韧顽强的苦战精神。正如刘伯承将军在战斗动员中说的，“那怕把二野拚光了，中国革命也是要马上胜利的，敌人只剩下这六十万主力了！”陈谢兵团的首长们也拿上了步枪，司令部政治部等机关的非战斗人员都随时准备投入战斗。那怕只是给战场的一角增加那末一小点优势，每一个能打枪的人都找上一支枪，救护员在火线上刚刚包扎伤兵的空隙也舍不得让伤员的枪白躺着。终于一口气打了连续六十八天的六个歼灭战，解放了长江以北广大地区。尔后一年中百万雄师渡长江，各路大军四出解放全国大陆的大进军都在这基础上迅速展开了。
    消灭敌军八百○七万人，缴获各种炮五万四千余门，各种机枪近三十二万挺，火焰喷射器二百二十八具，飞机一百八十九架，舰艇二百艘，坦克六百二十二辆，装甲车三百八十九辆，汽车二万余辆，——这就是四年解放战争的主要战绩。当国民党二十二年的反动统治被打成粉碎的时候，中国人民不仅打出了一个崭新的人民国家，而且打出了一支拥有陆海空军的现代化的强大国防力量。兵器展览会陈列着的武器，从美国特务的钢笔手枪到口径一五五公厘的美造榴弹炮，从暗杀手杖枪到美国人准备远涉重洋，爬上旁人国土的登陆两栖坦克，从第一次世界大战时期制造的德国榴弹炮到第二次世界大战以后美国送给蒋介石的火焰喷射器，这里面有德国的，日本的，意大利的，英国的，法国的，奥地利的，捷克的，最多的则是美国的。这些喜欢拿着枪炮到外国去杀人的帝国主义战争贩子们，几十年来他们的武器不知吸尽了多少中国人民的血。当这些武器今天在中国人民手中变成了保卫世界和平的强大力量时，制造这些武器的战争罪犯们如德日意法西斯之流已经从世界上可耻地毁灭了；捷克和奥地利变成了和平的人民国家；就是喜欢到亚洲玩火的美国战争贩子，也和它鼓舞着和支持着的蒋介石一起滚出中国大陆了。
    战犯用什么武器杀人，就将受到什么武器惩罚；一旦侵略武器落到人民手中，它就会马上成为制止侵略的和平力量。这是中国人民解放军的全部历史所证明了的。管看展览品登陆战车的青年连长，抗战时打过七年游击，两年前部队缴获了四辆美式坦克后，他便以六小时学会开汽车，又以一小时学会开坦克，然后就立刻驾着坦克打进济南城。以后在淮海战役中，他也驾着美国坦克和美械化的敌人作战。在上海缴获到美国登陆坦克后，他又摸索学成一个熟练的驾驶员。人民有本事夺取它，就有本事学会用它。大炮是这样，坦克是这样，军舰飞机也是这样。在解放万山群岛的战斗中，“先锋”号等青年人民炮舰就击沉了四艘敌舰。“奋斗”号炮舰在与敌两倍大的炮舰遭遇时，勇敢而机警地在五十米达内与敌舰搏斗，将其击伤，炮手自己负伤后又代替牺牲了的驾驶员掌舵，人民解放军的英勇顽强的光荣传统开始在人民海军中出现了。从照片可以看出：他们不仅修理好了被蒋机炸毁了的江南造船厂，启救出沉没的舰只，而且在聚精会神演习登陆台湾，演习运送登陆坦克掩护其敌前登陆。青年人民空军也一样，从他们创造了全国跳伞最高纪录和完成了高空远距离的空投伟绩看来，井岗山的红军传统也开始在年轻的空军里闪耀起来了。当帝国主义的侵略战火正在朝鲜和越南燃烧，肆无忌惮的火焰正在烤着祖国东北角边疆和西南角边疆的时候，当那个从中国大陆上滚出去了的美帝国主义又到祖国的天空和海上玩火的时候，眼前展现着的海空军的陈列馆尤其令人兴奋。虽然，比起洋洋大观的陆军战绩陈列馆来，它们还显得很年轻。但是有一点是可以肯定的：人民有本事从敌人手里夺取新的武器，就有本事学会掌握新的技术。而且，当它们在解放台湾的前线出现的时候，我们不仅可以看到新的技术，而且可以看到这种新技术所向无敌的战斗作风。（附图片）
