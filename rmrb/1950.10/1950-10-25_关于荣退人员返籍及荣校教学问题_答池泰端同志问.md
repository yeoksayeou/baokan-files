　　On the Return to Native Place of Honorably Retired Personnel and the Issue of Teaching in Honor Schools
    Answering Comrade Chi Tai Duan's Questions
    To the Editor:
    I am an honorably discharged soldier from the Honor Military School of Chahar Province, North China. Although I was injured in battle, the injury is very light, and I am still able to work. Currently, our school's organizational structure only includes the second, third, and fourth grades of elementary school, in addition to two groups for cadre culture and theory. The courses are: arithmetic and Chinese language for the second and third grades; arithmetic, Chinese language, geography, and history for the fourth grade; elementary school arithmetic and junior high school Chinese language for the cadre culture group; and a specialized study of the Brief History of Social Development for the cadre theory group. In the honor school, comrades from the Central South and Southwest regions account for 40-50% of the total number of people, and their cultural levels vary. Some have been assigned to work outside. However, because they could not understand the local dialects when interacting with the masses at their work posts, their work could not be carried out, so they had to return to the school. Now that it has been almost a year since the liberation of Guangdong, Fujian, and the Southwest, why hasn't the higher authority introduced them back to their native places for work?

Comrade Chi Tai Duan:
    The Department of Preferential Treatment of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government has provided the following brief response to your questions:
    In the past, due to the recent liberation of Guangdong, Fujian, and the Southwest, the Central Government stipulated that the sending of honorably retired personnel to the new areas should be temporarily postponed. At present, social order in some areas has not yet fully stabilized, so mass repatriation has not yet taken place. However, individual comrades who need to or can return to their native places can be introduced, with the consent of the people's government at or above the provincial or municipal level of their place of origin, through prior contact by the organization to which they belong. In the future, as the situation in the new areas gradually improves, they can be introduced back to their native places one after another.
    The purpose of the honor school is to cultivate the knowledge and skills of honorably discharged soldiers for re-employment, so that they can make a living in the future. However, because the members of the People's Liberation Army mostly come from rural areas and have a generally low level of education; and also because the honor school students are introduced from various places sporadically, and their learning requirements are also very inconsistent. Therefore, it is difficult for the honor school to be the same as ordinary schools in terms of teaching system and teaching methods. However, the comrades in charge of this work in the central government and in various places are currently studying the issue of how to improve and improve the honor school in the future to gradually regularize it.

### 关于荣退人员返籍及荣校教学问题  答池泰端同志问

　　关于荣退人员返籍及荣校教学问题
    答池泰端同志问编辑同志：
    我是华北察哈尔省荣誉军人学校一个荣誉军人，虽然在战斗中负伤，可是伤势很轻，尚能工作。现在我校编制上，只有初小二三四年级，另外有干部文化和理论两个组。课程是：二三年级上算术、国语；四年级上算术、国语、地理、历史；干部文化组上高小算术、初中国文；干部理论组专门研究社会发展简史。荣校中，中南、西南两区的同志占总人数百分之四五十，文化程度高低不一，曾经分配一部分出去工作。但他们因在工作岗位上与群众接近讲话听不懂，工作不能推行，所以只得仍然回校。现在两广、福建及西南等地，解放已近一年，为什么上级不给介绍回籍工作呢？

    池泰端池泰端同志：
    你的问题已由中央人民政府内务部优抚司简复如下：
    两广、福建及西南等地，过去因解放不久，中央曾规定新区各地荣退人员暂缓遣送。目前，某些地方社会秩序仍未完全安定，故仍未大批遣返。但个别同志需要或可以返籍者，可由所在机关向其原籍省市以上人民政府先行联系，经同意后，可以介绍。今后新区情况逐渐好转，即可陆续介绍回籍。
    荣校目的是为了培养荣誉军人转业就业之知能，使之将来能谋生立业。惟因人民解放军成员多系来自农村的农民，一般文化水平较低；同时荣校学员又是各地零星介绍来的，学习要求也极不一致。因此，荣校在教学制度上、教学方法上，很难与一般学校相同。但今后如何提高改善荣校，使之逐步正规化的问题，现中央及各地负责这一工作的同志们，都正在研究中。
