Editor's Note: To gain an in-depth understanding of the agricultural production situation in the old revolutionary base areas, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC formed an investigation team in early July this year, headed by Comrades Wu Guangtang and Guo Zhong, to conduct a one-and-a-half-month rural investigation in Wuxiang County. They discovered many new problems that have arisen three years after the land reform: the rural areas have become "middle peasantized," farmers are generally becoming wealthier, and advanced villages have restored or exceeded pre-war production levels. Land in Wuxiang was roughly divided equally during the land reform movement of 1946-47, but in less than three or four years, land has begun to concentrate, some people are becoming impoverished, while others have concentrated two to three times more land than the average per capita amount in the village. Production mutual aid teams, which farmers love most, have begun to decline because new and improved methods have not been proposed in time as production developed. In some places, they are still developing vigorously due to the slogan of combining technology with mutual aid teams. How should rural leadership transition from the all-encompassing approach of not separating Party and government to a system of division of labor and responsibility? This report has grasped sufficient materials for these problems, specifically studied and analyzed the causes of the problems, and proposed relatively correct solutions. We believe that the method used in this report to study problems, the problems raised, and the solutions proposed are generally good. The path taken by all old liberated areas in North China is roughly similar to that of Wuxiang, and the same problems may have occurred. If the provincial committees follow the example of the Shanxi Provincial Committee, organize some strong investigation teams to conduct investigations in the rural areas, they will surely discover many new problems and propose solutions, further improve the leadership of production work, and strive for the further prosperity of farmers in North China. This is very necessary.

In order to understand the rural production situation in the old revolutionary base areas and some of the current problems in organizing mutual aid teams, we conducted a special investigation in Wuxiang. The first step was to select typical villages for in-depth investigation; the second step was to conduct research in conjunction with responsible comrades from the county and district; the third step was to conduct broader observations based on the results of the investigation and research. A total of six typical villages were selected this time, namely the advanced villages of Jiaoshanggou and Jianzhang, the general village of Hanbi, the backward village of Donggou, and the villages of Podi and Dongcun, which were liberated after the surrender of the Japanese invaders. A comprehensive report on the investigation of several issues is as follows:

First, agricultural production has generally recovered, and conditions for developing production are also available.

According to the investigation of six typical villages, the rural situation in Wuxiang has undergone fundamental changes after the land reform movement. The first manifestation is that the feudal exploitation of the land system in rural areas has been eliminated, and middle peasants account for the vast majority in rural areas. Middle peasant households account for 86% of the total number of households, 88.7% of the population, 88.7% of the land, 84.6% of the livestock, 82.5% of the sheep flocks, and 86% of the grain production. On this new class basis, a large-scale production movement was launched, bringing agricultural production close to or reaching pre-war production levels.

In 1949, the total grain production of the six villages reached 19,206 shi (unprocessed grain), exceeding the pre-war grain production of 17,623 shi in 1936 by 8%. However, the development is uneven. For example, the pre-war yield per mu in Donggou Village was 1 shi and 2 dou, while the yield per mu in 1949 was 1 shi, 1 dou, and 5 sheng and 3 he, which is still 4 sheng and 7 he short. If each mu is required to increase production by 1 dou this year, it can be exceeded. According to the county party committee's estimate, if no major disasters occur this year, two-thirds of the villages in the county can exceed the pre-war production level, and one-third of the villages can reach the pre-war production level or be slightly insufficient.

The labor, livestock, and other production conditions used on the land have also been considerably restored. Labor has increased in the past two years (demobilization, transfer, and supplementary labor reserves); in addition, war service has been canceled, universal organization has been implemented, and women have been mobilized to participate in production, so labor is no longer difficult, and some households even have a surplus (since the Anti-Japanese War, the old liberated areas have always been short of labor. It is a new problem to say that some households now have a surplus, which deserves attention - Editor). The six villages have a total of 725 male full laborers, 469 women who have already participated in production, and 159 labor reserves, so each laborer cultivates an average of about 13.3 mu (women are counted as half). In Jiaoshanggou, the average labor input per mu of land was 8 in 1947, and the average labor input per mu of land was 13 in 1949, which also shows that the labor used on the land has increased compared with wartime. In terms of livestock, the six villages had a total of 325 livestock before the war, and suffered losses of more than two-thirds after the long-term destruction by the enemy. Now it has gradually recovered. In Jiaoshanggou Village, only 6 and a half draft animals were left in 1944, and now it has recovered to 90. The six villages reached 386 in 1949, and increased by 10 this year, exceeding the pre-war level. Each draft animal cultivates an average of 45 mu of land, and the livestock power used on the land has increased compared with pre-war. Draft animals were more concentrated before the war, and now they are more dispersed. Before the war, landlords, rich peasants, and wealthy middle peasants in Donggou Village exclusively owned 49 livestock, and now only 13 are privately owned. The recovery of sheep flocks is also better than generally estimated. Before the war, the six villages had a total of 2,704 sheep, and this year there are 2,374, reaching 88% of the pre-war level. Among them, Donggou and Jiaoshanggou have exceeded the pre-war levels. The recovery of farm tools has reached a sufficient level. At present, the six villages have a total of 1,935 large farm tools and 7,434 small farm tools. Donggou had 235 large farm tools before the war, and now has 279. The village had 1,496 small farm tools before the war, and now has 1,406. Hanbi also added three windmills and 27 carts that were missing before the war.

Due to the recovery of production, the lives of the masses have also been considerably improved, and some of the masses have also accumulated savings. According to a survey of 1,179 households in the six villages, 38 households had more than 10 shi of grain reserves, accounting for 3.14% of the total number of households. 116 households had more than 5 shi of grain reserves, accounting for 6.7% of the total number of households. 400 households had more than 1 shi of grain reserves, accounting for 33.46% of the total number of households (farmers have begun to have surplus grain, which is a new phenomenon three or four years after the land reform - Editor). 546 households had enough to eat, accounting for 47.2% of the total number of households. Those who did not have enough to eat accounted for 6.5% of the total number of households. According to the county party committee's estimate of the general situation in the county, about 25% of the households have a surplus, 65% of the households have a small surplus or enough to eat, and about 10% of the households have difficulties (i.e., widows and orphans, military dependents, incompetent managers, and layabouts). This is roughly the same as the above-mentioned typical investigation. However, there are also better villages. For example, in Tuheping, among 26 households, one household had more than 100 shi of grain reserves, six households had 10 to 20 shi of grain reserves, six households had 5 to 10 shi of grain reserves, and 13 households had 2 to 3 shi of grain reserves. There are no households in the village that lack food.

The houses destroyed by the enemy have also begun to be repaired. Hanbi had 1,450 rooms before the war, and 722 were destroyed by the enemy. More than 300 rooms have been repaired in the past two years. The houses in Tuheping have been repaired and exceeded the pre-war level. The village has a total of 214 households, repaired 105 rooms last year, and repaired 50 rooms this year, and has prepared all the bricks, tiles, wood, and stone for more than 70 rooms, which can be built this autumn. However, house repairs are only in the beginning stage, and the complete restoration of villages severely destroyed by the enemy cannot be achieved in a short period of time.

The lives of farmers have generally reached the level of middle peasants before the war. The six villages had 2,704 middle peasants before the war, with an average annual consumption of 3 shi and 8 dou of unprocessed grain per person. Now there are 4,097 middle peasants, with an average annual consumption of 4 shi per person. Before the war, there were 1,664 poor peasants, with an average annual consumption of 2 shi and 6 dou and 6 sheng per person. Now there are 71 poor peasants, with an average consumption of 3 shi and 3 dou and 6 sheng, which is also close to the pre-war level of middle peasants. The life of eating chaff and vegetables in the past has basically changed.

The above situation shows that rural production has generally recovered, and conditions for further development of production are also available. Several new issues have also been raised in the leadership of agricultural production, which need to be addressed: 1. Except for a few advanced villages, cadres and the masses in most villages have a sense of satisfaction with production, and how to further improve production on the existing basis is not clear enough. 2. Rural labor has begun to have a surplus, and how to guide farmers to use surplus labor should also be well studied. 3. At present, some farmers in rural areas still have difficulties in production and life. The above-mentioned six villages also have 6.5% of the households that do not have enough to eat. The county party committee investigated another seven villages and found that 24.2% of the households and 19.2% of the land were cultivated by semi-labor and auxiliary labor (such as women, children, and the elderly). 17.9% of the households and 12.3% of the land have no labor to cultivate. Among them, except for the families of revolutionary martyrs and cadres who can solve part of the problem with代耕 (substitute cultivation), there is still a large part that has serious difficulties, and how to help and support their production should also be paid attention to.

Second, the rural class has begun to have new differentiation.

After several years of production movement, agricultural production has recovered to the pre-war level. The rural class relations have also begun to undergo new differentiation. The main manifestation is in the buying and selling of land. In 1948 and 1949, the number of households selling land in the six villages was 139, accounting for 11.8% of the total number of households, and a total of 410 mu of land was sold, accounting for 2.28% of the total number of mu. The reasons for selling land are: 64 households adjusting producers (i.e., exchanging bad land for good land, exchanging distant land for nearby land, selling land to buy livestock, etc.), and 15 households transferring and migrating. After the land is generally divided equally, it is normal to adjust and exchange due to the incomplete adaptation of labor and land occupation, which is also beneficial to the development of production. However, 50 households (accounting for 4.32% of the total number of households) were forced to sell 151.9 mu of land (accounting for 37.1% of all land sold) due to difficulties in production and life caused by diseases, deaths, and disasters. That is to say, in two years, 4.32% of the farmers in these six villages have lost their land because of production and living difficulties. Some have even sold all their land and wandered outside (such as Wei Jinke in Hanbi). Some have sold more than one-half of their allocated land (such as Wang Jinzhu in Donggou, who originally received 10.3 mu of land and has sold 7.1 mu due to illness), which will inevitably affect future production and life. In addition, there are 6 households who sold a small amount of land because they have little labor and a lot of land and are unwilling to hire people, but it did not affect their lives. In addition, there are 3 households occupied by the public, and the reason is unknown for 1 household.

From the perspective of production methods, although rich peasants are still very few, land has begun to concentrate. Among the 214 households in Hanbi Village, 8 households have risen to become wealthy middle peasants. Wei Lanshan's family in Tuheping has 9 people, 72 mu of land (exceeding the average of the village by one time), one ox, two mules, and eighty sheep. He hires three sheep workers and has three full laborers of his own. Last year, he hired one and a half long-term workers, and this year he hired half a long-term worker. There are also about 12 mu of land that rely on mutual aid teams to cultivate. His family has 32 rooms, 2 cellars, and 100 shi of grain reserves. Shen Zhongxiu's family in Tuheping has 5 people, 60 mu of land, exceeding the average of the village by two times. Shen Bunian's family has 8 people and 60 mu of land. Liu Huaizhen's family has 3 people and 22 mu of land, exceeding the average of the village by one time. The land in Wuxiang has been roughly divided equally, and it cannot be said to be very slow to concentrate two or three times the land in a very short time.

From the above situation, it can be seen that the rural class relations have begun to undergo new differentiation. Some farmers have not been liberated for long, lack savings, and are weak. They cannot withstand the attack of disasters. In addition, rural credit is stagnant (this shows the importance of rural credit cooperatives - Editor), so that they have to sell their land when they encounter unexpected disasters.

Typical investigations and extensive observations fully prove a truth: villages where organization is implemented and the production movement is carried out have fewer or no people selling land due to production difficulties and living difficulties. Jiaoshanggou has a total of 216 households, and Jianzhang has a total of 222 households (advanced villages). Six households in each village sold land due to production and living difficulties, with a total of 24.4 mu of land sold, an average of 2 mu per household. Hanbi has a total of 214 households (general village). Thirteen households sold land due to production and living difficulties, with a total of 47.7 mu of land sold, an average of 3.67 mu per household. Donggou has a total of 269 households (backward village). Fourteen households sold land due to production and living difficulties, with a total of 45.4 mu of land sold, an average of 3.24 mu per household. In addition, villages with better organization and production movements, such as Baijiazhuang and Suyu (advanced villages), have no one selling land due to production and living difficulties. This shows that rural production urgently needs to be organized. However, many rural cadres are more麻痹 (numb) to this problem. They have not seriously analyzed and studied the situation of class differentiation, and lack a clear understanding of the direction of rural production. Some cadres still have the idea that production does not need leadership and that there is no policy for production (serious in early spring). They do not understand the Party's leading role for farmers and the significance of leading farmers to organize. Activating rural credit and helping farmers overcome difficulties are the urgent needs of farmers and an important measure to reduce farmers' selling of land due to production and living difficulties. Wuxiang's credit work has not been widely carried out. However, in villages where credit work is done relatively well, such as Shangyuan, Beizhang, Xingtang, and Lao'ao, the credit cooperatives can solve the urgent needs of farmers to purchase draft cattle, farm tools, and weddings, funerals, and illnesses with a considerable amount of credit, so that farmers have a chance to breathe. Therefore, very few households in these villages sell land (two households in Lao'ao and one household in Beizhang), and most of them belong to adjusting producers. This credit work is only in the beginning stage, and there are still many problems, which need to be studied and resolved.

Third, the current agricultural production mutual aid teams are developing in two different directions.

According to the investigation of six typical villages, and the county party committee's research on 127 mutual aid teams in another six villages, and the situation of 728 mutual aid teams in 34 villages, except for a few mutual aid teams in a few advanced villages, most mutual aid teams are generally showing a tendency to decline and disintegrate because production has recovered, farmers' production conditions have gradually become available, and production difficulties have been reduced. However, in the guidance of the mutual aid movement, new content and a further direction for improving production have not been proposed in time. Although the form of mutual aid teams still exists as before, the team members are ideologically scattered, not very motivated, and even actually do their own thing. This situation is quite common. Farmers reflect that in recent years, "production is getting better year by year, but the organization is getting worse year by year." The four old revolutionary base villages in this investigation can just explain the development of the mutual aid movement in Wuxiang and the general situation at present. Jiaoshanggou is the best, especially Shi Fusheng's mutual aid team, which has grasped the new direction of "organizing, improving technology, developing production, and becoming rich" on the basis of production recovery, and proposed a clear plan for increasing production and becoming rich. Because new content has been added to the old mutual aid basis, and it can effectively further improve production, the team members are very motivated and there is no tendency to disintegrate or decline. In the guidance of the mutual aid movement, three basic links have been specifically grasped: (1) Closely combined with improving technology, the mutual teaching and learning of old technologies have been summarized and improved; the active dissemination of new technologies has received good results. (2) The surplus labor after organization is rationally used to improve the production conditions of intensive cultivation, and all the land has been repaired. For example, Wang Laixiu has one mu and three fen of tenth-grade land (the output should be 1 dou and 5 sheng per mu). He used 30 workdays to cut the outer retaining slope and level the land, pick up the stones in the land, apply 100 dan of base fertilizer, and apply topdressing fertilizer, plow five times, and hoe twice. As a result, he harvested 3 shi of wheat this year, turning the tenth-grade land into first-grade land. Shi Fusheng also transformed one mu (two pieces) of tenth-grade land in the same way, and harvested 1.5 dou of wheat this year. Another team member, Liu Zhi, has 8.5 mu of wheat fields, with an output of 3.2 shi. As a result of processing, he harvested 9 shi of wheat this year, exceeding the output by nearly three times. This points out a way to use surplus labor to improve production. (3) Combined with sideline occupations. Shi Fusheng's mutual aid team jointly opened a casserole kiln to increase income by using slack season labor. However, from the perspective of the entire county, there are very few mutual aid teams like Shi Fusheng's.

Secondly, Jianzhang is also an advanced village in Wuxiang, and production is also relatively good, but the mutual aid team has a significant decline. The main reason is that the economy has recovered, livestock and farm tools are all available, there is a surplus of labor, and no new content can be proposed in the mutual aid guidance. Mutual aid production does not have a significant increase in production compared with individual farming, so team members have a sense of satisfaction and require free production. For example, the mutual aid team of Cui Youfu and others has been a model team for several years, and now it is actually doing its own thing. This idea of individual farming also exists seriously within the Party. In Jianzhang, only one of the twenty-three mutual aid teams has a Party member as the team leader. Hanbi is a general village, and the mutual aid team is still at the stage of organizing to overcome difficulties. However, because production has been restored, households with difficulties in production have become a minority. The mutual aid team lacks new content and the direction of improving production is not clear, so there is generally not much energy and a lack of forward-looking vigor. The slogan of "organizing to overcome difficulties" has a profound impact on the masses and has indeed played a great role in restoring production. However, the current situation has changed. The slogan of overcoming difficulties does not have much mobilizing significance for the masses, and it may even produce a fear of unconditionally helping households in difficulty in mutual aid and suffering losses (some places have harmed middle peasants in mutual aid). In addition to the problems of implementing equal value policies and leadership style that still need to be resolved in the mutual aid teams in the above two villages (of course, some mutual aid teams have better policy implementation, and generally can implement work-based work, use work tickets, and clear work on schedule), the main reason for their decline is that after production recovery and development, new production content was not added in time in the guidance, and the masses could not be effectively and continuously led to increase production, so that the masses felt that mutual aid did not have a significant improvement in production compared with individual farming. Therefore, the inherent idea of small private owners in farmers to freely develop production grew up. But this does not mean that farmers basically do not want mutual aid, or that mutual aid will inevitably decline when production develops to a certain extent. On the contrary, farmers are nostalgic for mutual aid. The fact that the mutual aid team has shown ideological decline and lack of energy, but has not collapsed, shows this. When recalling the historical road, many farmers feel that organization has indeed saved them from poverty. Mutual aid has been beneficial and they are unwilling to disband (such as Jianzhang). Some farmers also reflect that mutual aid and collective labor have become a habit, and they feel lonely when they have individual land and do not want to move when they stand up their hoes (such as Hanbi). The general reflection is: Chairman Mao is right, we must organize. This shows that after the Party led the farmers to obtain land, the farmers have a considerable degree of political and ideological awareness, and have a preliminary habit of collective labor. We must recognize the declining and disintegrating ideas of farmers in the new situation because they cannot find a direction. We must sufficiently estimate the backwardness of farmers as small producers and small private owners. Failure to recognize this fact will relax the leadership of farmers and relax the education of farmers. The instruction that "the serious problem is to educate the farmers" is just explaining this point. But on the other hand, it also shows that as long as we can clarify the direction, master the policy (voluntary and equal value), be good at leading and can constantly sum up the experience of cadres and farmers, especially the experience that mutual aid can achieve practical results compared with individual farming, and constantly educate and improve farmers, it is not a problem to lead farmers to organize.

Again, from the perspective of Donggou backward village (the other backward villages and general villages, and the third and fourth types of mutual aid teams are roughly the same), the mutual aid team in the village is actually only temporary labor exchange (of course, there are some good ones). They all disbanded during the wheat harvest season, and the team members still did their own thing. The reasons for this are more complicated. First of all, the branch is not united enough, and the leading backbone is poor. The equal value policy is not well implemented, and youth mutual aid and labor exchange are mostly formal. In addition, individual cadres take advantage of the mutual aid team, the wages are inappropriate, and the work is not cleared on time. In addition, the leadership's coercive style and formalism make mutual aid not effective and even collapse. This is still a large number of problems in the whole county. Therefore, we believe that the development of the mutual aid movement in Wuxiang must be clarified in three aspects: direction, policy implementation, and improvement of style. But at present, the problem of clarifying the production direction needs to be solved more urgently.

In addition, there are several problems in the mutual aid movement that need to be studied: (1) According to the investigation of five villages, there are currently more young and middle-aged people organized in mutual aid teams with the concept of "soldiers against soldiers and generals against generals". Therefore, the number of households and people participating in the mutual aid team is decreasing, while the degree of labor and livestock organization is increasing. In 1948, the five villages organized 73.2% of the households and 80% of the population. In 1949, only 72.7% of the households and 77.6% of the population remained. In 1948, labor was 83.7%, and in 1949 it was 91%. Livestock in 1948 was 74%, and in 1949 it was 85%. The results of the investigation show that this mutual aid team has the following weaknesses: First, a large number of old farmers with technology are excluded from the team, and the improvement of technology is affected. Second, semi-auxiliary labor and women's labor are not absorbed, and labor cannot be used rationally, resulting in labor waste. Third, mutual aid for households with labor and livestock difficulties is poor (of course, it is mutual aid under the principle of equal value), but it should not be impatient and should be gradually changed on the basis of guiding farmers to improve production requirements. (2) Excessive emphasis should not be placed on small and flexible. Too small mutual aid teams have difficulties in overall production planning and the use and scheduling of surplus labor, especially because rural leading backbones are lacking, and mutual aid teams without backbones are difficult to do well. It must be decided by the masses themselves according to the degree of production development and the requirements of the masses, and is generally appropriate with about ten households. (3) "Mutual aid at all times and in all things" is indeed difficult. The masses generally reflect that it is not free to participate in the mutual aid team, which is the reason for this. Under the principle of unified development of production plans and unified labor scheduling, collective labor should be carried out if it is beneficial to the collective and can save labor according to the actual needs of life. Individual farming should be carried out if individual farming is more appropriate for certain small life matters. (4) Taking care of households with labor and livestock difficulties is indeed an important issue. Their difficulties need to be solved, but mutual aid teams must not be disadvantaged, and middle peasants must not be harmed because of this. The principle of voluntary and equal value must be mastered and appropriately resolved. (5) The wage issue within the mutual aid team must also be appropriately grasped. At present, there are roughly four forms: One is like Wei Lanshan in Tuheping, who has 72 mu of land in his family. In addition to his own labor to cultivate the land, he relies on the mutual aid team for about 12 mu of land. He pays wages and others cultivate. The second is the form of mutual exchange of labor. The third is women's labor participating in the mutual aid team. The fourth is that there are a few people with surplus labor, but most people rely on the mutual aid team to use labor. The general wage of mutual aid in Wuxiang is 3 sheng in ordinary times and 4 sheng in busy times, which is decided by the mutual aid team. Some places reflect that the masses are too low and suffer losses, and it is better to do short-term work. However, some people are afraid of paying wages and are unwilling to help each other. The general wage is higher than long-term work and lower than short-term work, but it should be democratically decided according to the employer-employee relationship of the mutual aid team and the local specific situation, and attention should be paid to continuous research and improvement to make it reasonable.

Fourth, there have been considerable improvements in production leadership, but there are still several issues that need to be studied.

I. Ideological mobilization and policy education

Wuxiang has paid more attention to ideological mobilization and policy education in the production movement. In winter, Party members were trained in rotation, and more than half of them were trained. Militia, youth, and women have also undergone winter training centered on production. The mobilization after the start of spring plowing was even more extensive. The county convened representative conferences of all circles, Party congresses, youth congresses, women's congresses, and cooperative representative conferences. The villages also generally convened mobilization meetings of the same nature. In addition, a meeting of heroes, models, and technical experts with more than 600 people was convened. The number of people mobilized in the spring plowing was about 7,000, which played a great role in implementing this year's production policies. After the end of spring plowing, Party member appraisal was conducted throughout the county, and the reward and punishment system was strictly implemented. Those who led production well and had achievements and creations were commended, and those who were passive and did not work were criticized and even punished. The work of appraising merits and models was carried out after the end of summer production, and the ideological agitation work was continuously carried out, so that the chaotic ideas of cadres, Party members, and activists were gradually overcome and their enthusiasm was continuously improved.

In terms of policies, the villages in the county discussed the production reward methods one by one in combination with the ideological situation of the masses and solved them specifically. In the spring plowing movement, they also studied Li Shunda and others' production report to Chairman Mao and carried out in-depth practical education of the policy. It is precisely because they paid attention to ideological mobilization and policy education at any time in the production movement that the production enthusiasm of the masses is high. However, in the education of cadres, not enough attention has been paid to clarifying policies and ideas through summarizing work. Some places showed abstract and empty propaganda to the masses, such as saying that if they are not organized, they will not be given tractors, and if they are organized, they will embark on the road of socialist industrialization, etc., which cannot produce positive results, but instead cause ideological confusion among the masses. Although farmers are currently actively producing, there are still concerns, such as being afraid of saying "yes" and being afraid of saying "exploitation." Policy education should continue to be strengthened to completely eliminate the ideological concerns of farmers.

II. Organizational leadership and work style

After the leadership system of separating Party and government and assigning special duties was proposed this spring and the forces of various systems were brought into play, there has been a new change in the all-encompassing style of work at the county and village levels, but there are still several problems that have not been resolved. At the beginning of the implementation in early spring, there were many meetings (both cadre meetings and mass meetings). Jianzhang held 36 meetings in 40 days, and Dongcun held 24 meetings in 20 days. The district reported every month on the first day and summarized the whole month on the fifth day. The county government wanted to summarize on the 15th, and the county party committee wanted to summarize on the 25th. When summarizing, cadres needed to go back to report and needed specific figures. The district chief and district secretary could only go to the township for six or seven days a month, and the rest of the time they participated in meetings to extract materials. Other cadres also formed a routine of running errands and simply pursuing figures, so that cadres could not go deep into the masses and felt tired. Moreover, there were many levels. When work reached the village, the village committee, Party branch general meeting, people's congress, and village government committee held meetings to implement the work to the masses, which had to take three or four days. Some activists often needed to attend several meetings with the same content and were even tired of it. The above phenomenon was corrected in April. Specific meeting systems were stipulated, and the main cadres were assigned to be responsible for leading specific areas and villages (small villages). For example, Dongcun in the fifth district stipulated that the branch committee should meet on the tenth of every month, the Communist Youth League and the Women's Federation should meet on the eighth, the village government committee should meet on the sixth, and the meetings of various systems should meet on the fourth. The main cadres were specifically assigned: the branch secretary was responsible for guiding the village government committee, the people's congress, the Party group, and the Women's Federation, the deputy branch secretary was responsible for youth and armed forces, the village chairman was responsible for civil affairs and education, and the vice chairman was responsible for finance and food. In addition, the eight branch committee members were divided into four sections (four electoral districts) for leadership. By holding the branch committee meeting, they could understand the situation of the whole village and summarize the production of the whole village. Although the meeting dates and division of labor in other villages were not exactly the same, the approach was roughly similar. As a result of this, two effects were achieved: on the one hand, the problems of many meetings and many levels were overcome. The same work was assigned to one person, and only one type of meeting was attended (such as the Communist Youth League, Women's Federation, and armed forces). The loss of working hours of main cadres and activists has also been greatly reduced, and the work is also easy to check; on the other hand, the work has a clear division of labor, which increases the responsibility of various systems and brings into play the enthusiasm of various systems. Not only within the Party, but also a group of non-Party cadres were united and actively worked. The phenomenon that the branch secretary and village chief, and a few key members monopolized a village in the past is gradually being overcome. For example, the production director of Jiangcun in the fifth district (a non-Party member) was very active after the division of labor was clarified. He automatically convened a meeting of the production committee and the technology committee to study the work, and looked for good methods of leading production in the newspaper every day. The education director (a non-Party member) took the initiative to inspect the people's schools and collected production materials every day to organize radio broadcasts. Non-Party cadres reflected: "In the past, good or bad was all up to you Party members. Now everyone is responsible to the people and runs the affairs of the whole village well (the benefits of dividing labor and absorbing non-Party cadres to participate in the work. This method can be learned in all regions - Editor)." This is a great improvement, of course, there are still many issues that should be further studied and resolved. Although the problem of cadres losing working hours has been reduced compared with the past, it is still felt that there are some more. According to calculations, a key village cadre has to go to the district and sub-district to report to the meeting, which takes almost six days a month, but in reality it is more than this number. Many village cadres reflect: "People who lead production have no way to play a leading role in production." Some cadres are afraid of delaying their own production and give up work. Therefore, it should also be considered whether there are still some more meetings in the village, and it is necessary to reduce them again according to the production season and work stage. In addition, the system of special duties and responsibilities and the system of division of labor in the village are very good. But there are not many villages that can truly implement it. It is necessary to sufficiently estimate the history of a few key cadres monopolizing and all-encompassing forms, and it is necessary to well summarize the experience of villages that implement it well and provide specific assistance. This is not only a matter of changing work style and saving labor, but also a matter of gradually establishing the democratic principle and democratic system at the village level.

　　山西武乡农村考察报告
    （中共山西省委八月二十五日向中共中央华北局的报告）
    编者按：中共山西省委为了深入了解老区农业生产情况，于今年七月初组成一个以武光汤、郭忠二同志为首的考察组，到武乡县进行了一个半月的农村考察。发现了许多在土地改革三年以后所发生的新问题：农村“中农化”了，农民普遍走向富裕，先进村已经恢复或超过了战前生产水平。武乡土地在一九四六——四七年的土地改革运动中，大体经过平分，不到三、四年工夫，土地已经开始集中，某些人开始贫穷化，某些人则集中了多于全村每人平均数的二倍到三倍的土地。农民所最喜爱的生产互助组，由于生产发展，没有及时提出新的提高的办法，有些开始消沉了，有些地方由于提出技术与互助组相结合的口号，仍在蓬勃发展。农村领导方式如何从党政不分的一揽子方式走上分工负责的路。对于这些问题，这一报告都掌握了充分的材料，具体研究与分析了发生问题的原因，并提出了比较正确的解决办法。我们认为，这一报告所用以研究问题的方法，所提出的问题和解决的办法，一般都是好的。华北所有老解放区所经历的路程与武乡大体相似，可能都有同样问题发生。各省委如果仿照山西省委的办法，组织一些强有力的考察组到农村去考察一番，一定都会发现许多新的问题并提出解决办法，进一步改进对生产工作的领导，为华北农民进一步的富裕而奋斗，这是很必要的。
    为了解老区农村生产情况及目前组织互助组中的若干问题，我们特在武乡作了专门考察。第一步选择典型村深入调查；第二步结合县区负责同志进行研究；第三步根据调查研究结果进行较广泛的观察。这次选择的典型村共六个，即先进村窖上沟、监漳，一般村韩壁，落后村东沟，日寇投降后解放村坡底及东村。兹将考察的几个问题综合报告如下：
    第一、农业生产大体已经恢复，发展生产的条件亦已具备。
    根据六个典型村的调查，武乡经过土地改革运动，农村情况已发生根本变化。首先表现在农村封建剥削的土地制度已经消灭，中农在农村中占了绝大多数。中农户数已占总户数百分之八十六，人口占百分之八十八点七，土地占百分之八十八点七，牲畜占百分之八十四点六，羊群占百分之八十二点五，产粮占百分之八十六。在这种新的阶级基础上，开展了大生产运动，使农业生产接近或达到了战前生产水平。
    一九四九年六个村的粮食生产共达一万九千二百零六石（原粮），超过战前一九三六年产粮一万七千六百二十三石的百分之八。但发展不平衡，如东沟村战前每亩产量一石二斗，一九四九年每亩产量一石一斗五升三合，尚差四升七合；今年每亩要求增产一斗则可超过。据县委估计：今年无重大灾害发生，全县可有三分之二村庄超过战前生产水平，三分之一村可达到战前生产水平，或少有不足。
    使用在土地上的劳畜力及其他生产条件，亦有相当恢复。劳力在近二年来已有增加（复员转业及劳力后备补充）；加以战争勤务取消了，普遍实行组织起来，发动妇女参加生产等，劳力已不再困难，若干户并有了剩余（从抗战以后，老解放区一向是缺乏劳力的，说现在若干户已有剩余，是一个新问题，值得注意——编者）。六个村男整劳力共有七百二十五个，已经参加生产的妇女四百六十九人，再加上劳力后备一百五十九人，则每个劳力平均耕地约十三亩三分（妇女折半算）。窖上沟在一九四七年每亩地平均用工八个，一九四九年每亩地平均用工十三个，也说明使用在土地上的劳力是较战时增加了。畜力方面，六个村战前共有牲畜三百二十五头，经过敌人的长期摧残，损失达三分之二以上。现已逐渐恢复。窖上村一九四四年耕畜仅留下六头半，现已恢复到九十头。六个村一九四九年已达三百八十六头，今年又增加十头，已超过战前。每头耕畜平均耕地四十五亩，使用在土地上的畜力较战前增加了。战前耕畜较集中，现在较分散。东沟村战前地主富农及富裕中农独占牲畜达四十九头，现独养者仅十三头。羊群恢复亦较一般估计为好。战前六个村共有羊二千七百零四只，今年已有二千三百七十四只，已达战前百分之八十八。其中东沟、窖上沟并超过了战前。农具恢复已达足用程度。现在六个村共有大农具一千九百三十五件，小农具七千四百三十四件。东沟战前大农具二百三十五件，现有二百七十九件。该村战前有小农具一千四百九十六件，现有一千四百零六件。韩壁并增添了战前缺少的风车三架，大车二十七辆。
    由于生产的恢复，群众生活亦有相当改善，部分群众并已有了积蓄。据六村一千一百七十九户调查，存粮十石以上者三十八户，占总户数百分之三点一四。存粮五石以上者一一六户，占总户数百分之六点七。存粮一石以上者四○○户，占总户数百分之三三点四六（农民开始有了余粮，这是土改三、四年以后的新气象——编者）。够吃够用者五四六户，占总户数百分之四七点二。不够吃者占总户数百分之六点五。另据县委对该县一般情况估计，有剩余户约占百分之二十五，少有剩余或够吃用户占百分之六十五，有困难户（即孤寡，军干烈属，不善经营者及二流子等）约占百分之十。与上述典型调查情况大体接近。但也有较好的村，如土河坪二十六户，存粮一百石以上者一户，存粮十石到二十石者六户，存粮五石到十石者六户，存粮二石到三石者十三户，全村无缺吃的户。
    被敌人焚毁的房屋亦已开始修建。韩壁战前有房一、四五○间，被敌焚毁七二二间。去今两年已修复三百余间。土河坪房屋修复后已超过战前。该村共二一四户，去年修房一○五间，今年修五○间，并已准备好七十余间的全部砖瓦木石，今秋即可修建。但房屋修复仅在开始，被敌摧毁严重村庄的全部恢复，尚非短时期可以作到。
    农民生活一般已达战前中农水平。六个村庄战前有中农二、七○四人，每人全年平均消费原粮三石八斗，现有中农四、○九七人，每人全年平均消费四石。贫农战前一、六六四人，每人平均全年消费二石六斗六升，现在贫农七十一人，平均消费三石三斗六升，亦接近战前中农水平。基本上已改变了过去吃糠吃菜的生活。
    以上情况说明农村生产已大体恢复，进一步发展生产的条件亦已具备。在农业生产领导上亦提出了若干新的问题，要求着手解决：１、除少数先进村外，大部分村庄的干部与群众对生产有满足情绪，如何在现有基础上进一步提高生产，这种思想是不够明确的。２、农村劳力开始有了剩余，如何指导农民使用剩余劳力，这个问题亦应很好研究。３、目前农村尚有一部分农民在生产和生活上都有困难。上述六个村，也还有百分之六点五的户数不够吃。该县县委调查了另外七个村庄，发现有百分之二四点二的户数，百分之一九点二的土地，是半劳力和辅助劳力（如妇女、儿童、老人）耕种的。百分之一七点九的户数，百分之一二点三的土地，则没有劳力耕种。其中除烈军干属可以用代耕方法解决一部外，仍然有很大一部分有严重困难，如何帮助扶植他们生产，也是应该注意的。
    第二、农村阶级已开始有了新的分化。
    经过几年来的生产运动，农业生产已恢复到战前水平。农村的阶级关系亦开始发生了新的分化。主要表现在土地的买卖上。一九四八和一九四九两年，六个村出卖土地的户数，共为一三九户，占总户数的百分之一一点八，共出卖土地四一○亩，占总亩数的百分之二点二八。出卖土地的原因是：调整生产者（即坏地换好地，远地换近地，卖地买牲口等）六十四户，转业迁移者十五户。在土地大体平分之后，由于劳力与土地占有不完全适应，调整调换是正常现象，对于发展生产亦有利。但是，亦有五○户（占总户数百分之四点三二），因疾病、死亡、灾难等原因，造成生产生活上的困难，被迫出卖土地一五一点九亩（占全部出卖土地的百分之三七点一）。这就是说，在二年内，这六个村中已有百分之四点三二的农户，因为生产生活困难，而丧失了自己的土地。有的甚至已把土地全部卖出，出外流浪（如韩壁魏金科）。有的已出卖其分得土地二分之一以上（如东沟王金柱原分到十亩三分地，已因病出卖七亩一分），势必影响今后生产与生活。此外尚有六户因劳力少，土地多，不愿雇人，出卖少数土地，但未影响生活。另外，尚有公家占用者三户，原因不明者一户。
    从生产方式上看，富农虽还很少，但土地已开始集中。韩壁全村二一四户中，已有八户上升为富裕中农。土河坪魏兰山家有九口人，七十二亩地（超过该村平均数一倍），一牛、二骡、八十只羊。雇三个羊工，自己有三个整劳力，去年雇用一个半长工，今年雇半个长工。另有地约十二亩，靠互助组种。他家有房三十二间，窖二眼，存粮一○○石。土河申中秀家有五口人，六十亩地，超过该村平均数二倍。申步年家八口人，有六十亩地。刘怀珍家三口人，有二十二亩地，超过该村平均数一倍。武乡土地是经过大体上平分的，很短时间内能集中二倍或三倍的土地，不能说是很慢的。
    从上述情况中，可以看出农村阶级关系已开始发生新的分化。有些农民翻身不久，缺乏积蓄，力量单薄，经不起灾难的袭击，再加上农村信贷停滞（这里说明农村信贷合作社的重要性——编者），以致一遇意外灾难，只得被迫出卖自己的土地。
    典型调查与广泛考察充分证明一个真理：凡组织起来、生产运动开展的村庄，因生产困难、生活困难而出卖土地者就比较少，或者没有。窖上沟共二一六户，监漳共二二二户（先进村），因生产生活困难出卖土地者各六户，共卖地二四点四亩，每户平均二亩。韩壁共二一四户（一般村），因生产生活困难出卖土地者十三户，共卖地四七点七亩，每户平均三点六七亩。东沟共二六九户（落后村），因生产生活困难出卖土地者十四户，共出卖土地四五点四亩，每户平均三点二四亩。此外，组织起来，生产运动较好之白家庄、苏峪（先进村）等村，均没有因生产生活困难而出卖土地者。这就说明农村生产迫切需要组织起来。但是，许多农村干部对于这个问题是较麻痹的，他们并未认真分析研究阶级分化的情况，对农村生产方向也缺乏明确的认识。部分干部中还存在有生产不用领导，及生产没政策的思想（开春时严重）。他们不了解党对农民的领导作用，以及领导农民组织起来的意义。活跃农村信贷，帮助农民度过难关，是农民的迫切要求，也是减少农民因生产生活困难出卖土地的重要措施。武乡的信贷工作还未普遍开展。但如信贷工作搞的比较好的尚元、北漳、型塘、老凹等村，信贷社以相当数量的信贷，即可解决农民购买耕牛农具及婚丧嫁娶疾病等急需，使农民有喘息之机，因此，这几个村庄出卖土地的就很少（老凹二户北漳一户），且大部属于调整生产者。此项信贷工作仅在开始，其中问题尚多，尚需研究解决。
    第三、目前农业生产互助组向两个不同的方向发展。
    根据六个典型村的调查，及县委对于另六个村一百二十七个互助组的研究，与三十四个村七百二十八个互助组的情况看来，除少数先进村的若干互助组外，大部互助组由于生产恢复，农民生产条件逐渐具备，生产困难减少；而在互助运动的指导上，又没有即时提出新的内容与进一步提高生产的方向，因此，相当普遍地呈现着消沉解体倾向。互助组的形式虽然还照旧存在，但组员思想涣散，劲头不大，甚至实际上各干各的。这种情形相当普遍。农民反映近几年来是“生产一年比一年好，组织起来却一年不如一年”。在这次调查中的老区四个村，正可以说明武乡互助运动的发展，及目前的一般情况。窖上沟是最好的，特别是史富生的互助组，在生产已经恢复的基础上，抓住了“组织起来、提高技术、发展生产、发家致富”新的方向，并提出了明确增产发家计划。由于在旧的互助基础上增加了新的内容，并能够有效地进一步地提高生产，因此组员的劲头很大，并无任何解体消沉倾向。在互助运动的指导上，具体抓住了三个基本环节：（一）与提高技术密切结合，旧技术的互教互学总结提高；新技术的积极传播，均收到良好效果。（二）把组织起来后剩余的劳力，合理地使用在精耕细作改造生产条件上，把土地全部修整好了。如王来秀有一亩三分十等地（应产量每亩一斗五升），用三十个工，把这块地里切外垫坡地修平，拣去地内石块，施底肥一百担，并加施追肥，耕五次，锄二次，结果今年收获麦子三石，使十等地变为一等地。史富生有一亩（二块）十等地，也用同样办法改造了，今年收获小麦一石五斗。另一组员刘志，有麦田八点五亩，应产量三点二石，经过加工的结果，今年收麦九石，超过应产量几达三倍。这指明了一条使用剩余劳力提高生产的道路。（三）与副业结合。史富生互助组合伙开沙锅窖一座，利用农闲劳力增加收入。但按全县范围看，像史富生这样互助组是极少的。
    其次是监漳，也是武乡的先进村，生产也比较好，但互助组却有显著消沉。其主要原因是由于经济上恢复了，牲口农具都有一套，劳力剩余，互助指导上又提不出新的内容，互助生产比单干并无显著增产效果，因此组员有满足情绪，要求自由自在地生产。如崔有福等互助组，在几年内都是模范组现在实际是各干各的。这种单干思想，在党内也严重存在。监漳二十三个互助组，只有一个党员当组长。韩壁是一般村，互助组仍然停留在组织起来克服困难的阶段，但因生产已得到恢复，生产中有困难户成为少数，互助组缺乏新的内容，提高生产的方向不明确，因此普遍劲头不大，缺乏前进朝气。“组织起来克服困难”的口号，在群众中确实有深厚的影响，也确实在恢复生产中起了很大作用。但目前情况已发生变化，克服困难的口号，对群众的动员意义就不大了，甚至会产生一种害怕到互助中无条件帮助困难户自己吃亏的思想（曾有些地方在互助中伤害中农）。以上两村的互助组除贯彻等价政策及领导作风等问题仍需解决外（当然也有一部分互助组在政策贯彻上是较好的，一般能执行以活计工，使用工票，按期清工），其所以消沉的主要原因，在于生产恢复发展之后，指导上没有即时增加新的生产内容，不能有效地继续不断地领导群众增产，使群众感到互助比单干并无显著提高生产的成绩，因此，农民们所固有的小私有者自由自在发展生产的思想，便生长起来。但这并不能说农民基本上即不愿互助，或者说生产发展到一定程度，互助必然消沉。相反的，农民对互助是留恋的，互助组虽然表现了思想消沉与劲头不大，但并未垮台，正说明了这一点。好多农民在回忆历史道路时，感到组织起来确实从贫困中拯救了他们，互助沾过光不愿解散（如监漳），也有农民反映：互助、集体劳动已成习惯，单个土地感到寂寞，竖住锄头不想动（如韩壁）。普遍地反映是：毛主席说的没有错，一定得组织起来。这说明党领导农民取得土地之后，农民在政治上思想上已有相当觉悟，并有了初步的集体劳作习惯。我们不能不承认农民在新的情况下，找不到方向所产生的消沉解体思想，要足够估计农民小生产小私有者的落后性，不承认这一事实就会放松了对于农民的领导，放松了对于农民的教育。“严重的问题在于教育农民”的指示，正是说明这点。但另一方面也说明了：只要能明确方向，掌握政策（自愿等价），善于领导并能不断的总结干部农民的经验，特别是互助比单干能收实效的经验，随时教育与提高农民，领导农民组织起来是不成问题的。
    再次，从东沟落后村看（其他落后村及先进村一般村，三、四类互助组也大致如此），该村互助组实际上只有临时性的变工（当然也有些好的），麦收时期都解散了，组员们还是各干各。其原因就比较复杂，首先是支部不够十分团结，领导骨干差；等价政策贯彻的不好，青年互助变工多成形式；还有个别干部在互助组讨便宜，工资不适当，不按时清工，再加上领导上强制作风与形式主义，致使互助不起劲，甚至垮台。这在全县说来，还是大量存在的问题。因此我们认为目前武乡互助运动的开展，必须明确方向，贯彻政策，改善作风三方面并重。但目前明确生产方向问题更加迫切需要解决。
    此外互助运动中还有以下几个问题需要研究：（一）据五个村调查，目前互助组中“兵对兵将对将”青壮年组织起来较多，因此形成参加互助组的户数人数在下降，而劳畜力组织起来的程度却在增加。一九四八年五村共组织起来户数百分之七十三点二，人口百分之八十。四九年只剩下户数百分之七十二点七，人口百分之七十七点六。四八年劳力为百分之八十三点七，四九年为百分之九十一。畜力四八年为百分之七十四，四九年为百分之八十五。考察的结果，这种互助组存在以下弱点：第一，将大批有技术的老农排斥组外，技术提高受到影响。第二，不吸收半辅劳力妇女劳力，不能合理使用劳力，形成劳力浪费。第三，对劳畜困难户互助差（当然是在等价原则下的互助），但也不能性急，应在引导农民提高生产要求的基础上，逐渐加以改变。（二）不应过分强调小型灵活，太小的互助组在全面生产计划及剩余劳力使用调度上有困难，特别是农村领导骨干缺乏，没有骨干的互助组是很难搞好的。必须根据生产发展的程度，群众的要求，由群众自己决定，一般以十户上下为适宜。（三）“时时互助事事互助”，确实有困难。群众普遍反映参加互助组不自由，即是这个原因。应在统一发展生产计划与统一劳力调度原则下，根据生活实际需要，集体有利能省工者，即集体劳作，某些小生活，单干较适宜者即单干。（四）对劳畜力有困难户的照顾，确是一个重要问题，他们的困难需要解决，但绝对不能使互助组吃亏，更不能因此而伤害中农，必须掌握自愿等价原则，予以适当解决。（五）互助组内工资问题亦必须适当掌握，目前大体有四种形式：一种如土河坪魏兰山，家中有地七十二亩，除自己劳力耕地外，大约还有十二亩地依靠互助组，他出工资，别人耕种。第二种是互相变换工形式。第三种是妇女劳力参加互助组的。第四种是有剩余劳力的是少数人，但靠互助组使用劳力的是多数人。武乡互助工资一般是平时三升，忙时四升，由互助组决定。有些地方群众反映太低，吃亏，不如打短工。但也有人怕出工资不愿互助，一般工资是高于长工低于短工，但应根据互助组的主雇关系及当地具体情况民主决定，并注意不断研究改进，使之合理。
    第四、生产领导上已有相当改进，但还有若干问题需要研究。
    一、思想发动与政策教育
    武乡在生产运动中，是比较注意思想发动与政策教育的。在冬季即进行了党员轮训，受训者达半数以上，民兵青年妇女亦都经过以生产为中心的冬训。春耕开始后的动员更较广泛，县召开了各界代表会，党代会、青代会、妇代会及合作代表会议。各村大致也召开了同样性质的动员会议。此外还召开了六百余人的英模技术能手会议。春耕中动员的人数约达七千人，对贯彻本年生产方针政策作用很大。春耕结束在全县范围内进行了党员鉴定，严格地执行了奖惩制度，领导生产好，有成绩有创造的受到表扬，消极不工作的受到批评，甚至处分。夏季生产结束又进行了评功表模，不断地进行思想鼓动工作，使干部、党员、积极分子的混乱思想逐渐克服，积极性不断提高。
    在政策方面，该县各村对生产奖励办法，结合群众思想情况一条条地讨论，具体解决。在春耕运动中，又学习李顺达等向毛主席的生产报告，深入政策的实际教育。也正是因为他们在生产运动中随时注意了思想发动与政策教育，群众生产情绪是高的。但在干部教育上，通过总结工作明确政策思想是注意不够的。对群众有些地方表现抽象空洞的宣传，如说不组织起来不发给拖拉机，组织起来，走上社会主义工业化道路等，不能发生积极效果，反而造成群众的思想混乱。目前农民虽然在积极生产，但顾虑仍然是有的，如怕说“有”，怕说“剥削”等，还应继续加强政策教育，以彻底解除农民思想顾虑。
    二、组织领导与工作作风
    在今春提出党政分清与专职专责，发挥各系统力量的领导制度后，县村两级一揽子作风有新的转变，但也还有若干问题，不得解决。开春初执行时，表现开会多（干部会群众会均有）。监漳四十天内即开了三十六个会，东村二十天开了二十四个会，区上每月逢一汇报，五号做全月总结。县府十五号要总结，县委二十五号要总结，总结时需要干部回去汇报，要具体数字，区长区书一月只能下六、七天乡，其余均参加开会摘材料，其他干部亦形成跑腿单纯追求数字，致使干部不能深入群众，感到疲惫。而且层次多，工作到村，支委会、支部大会、人代会、村政委员会各系统会贯彻到群众身上，必须三四天，有些积极分子一样内容常需要参加几次会议更不厌其烦。以上现象到四月才纠正。具体规定了会议制度，主要干部分工负责分片分村（小村）领导。如五区东村规定支部会逢十开，青年团妇联逢八开，村政委员会逢六开，各系统会议逢四开，人代会每月两次；主要干部具体分工：支书负责指导村政委员会、人代会、党组及妇联会，副支书负责青年武装，村主席负责民政教育，副主席负责财粮；此外八个支委又分四段（四个选区）领导。开支委会便可了解全村情况，总结全村生产，其他各村开会日期及分工情形，虽不尽同，但做法大致与此相近。这样做的结果，收到两个效果：一方面克服了开会多，层次多的毛病，同样的工作一个人规定，只参加一种会（如青妇武），主要干部、积极分子误工亦已大量减少，工作亦便于检查；另一方面工作上有了明确分工，加重了各系统的责任，发挥了各系统的积极性，不只在党内而且还团结了一批党外干部，也积极工作。过去支书村长少数主干包办一村的现象，正在逐渐克服。如五区姜村生产主任（非党员）在明确分工后，非常积极，自动召集生产委员会议、技术委员会，研究工作，每天看报找好的领导生产方法。教育主任（非党员）主动检查民校，并每日搜集生产材料，组织广播筒。非党干部反映：“过去好坏都是你们党员的，现在大家对人民负责，办好全村的事（分工负责，吸收非党干部参加工作的好处，这一方式各地均可学习——编者）。这是很大的进步，当然还有很多问题应当继续研究解决。如干部误工问题虽比过去减少，但还觉得有些多，按计算一个村主干连到区及小区汇报开会，一个月有六天差不多，但实际上比此数多，好多村干部反映：“领导生产的人，就没有法子在生产上起带头作用。”也有些干部怕耽误自己生产，而放弃工作，因此还应考虑村中的会议是否还有些多，按生产季节及工作段落再加以减少还是必要的，此外专职专责制度与村内分工制度，是很好的。但能真正贯彻的村子还不多，要足够估计少数主要干部包办与一揽子形式的历史性，应很好总结执行较好村子的经验，予以具体帮助。这不但是个作风转变与省工问题，而是民主原则民主制度在村级逐渐建立问题。
    三、创造典型与推动一般
    这同样是一个尚未解决的老问题，今春武乡同样也走过弯路，开春是跑腿找数字，以后提出掌握基点，具体规定县委了解五个基点，区书区长伙搞一个基点，每个小区搞一个基点，这样全县可以有四十个基点村。但又发生死守基点放弃一般村领导的现象，干部反映：“一人包办二人听，放弃了小区基点也没做好”。县委又提出三点克服办法：第一、必须做好基点，做出成绩，影响一般，推动全面；第二、在力量使用上要迅速集中，迅速分散；第三、以基点为依托发动生产竞赛，组织参观。从实际查看，第三种办法是收到效果的。监漳的水利做的好，修渠按水车都有成绩，即召集附近村到监漳开会实际参观，由监漳干部报告经验，然后发动各村拟订自己的水利计划。此外，窖上沟的五比运动与洞上村改良技术中的稠改稀，都组织了附近村的参观比较，并参加了他们的互助组会议（如窖上沟），学习领导方法。实际参加田间工作，学习他们的互助生产与技术改良，这样不只可以在思想上启发鼓励其情绪，同时也吸收了实际经验，再以基点村的标准开展友谊竞赛，推动作用更大。
    但这是在一般的情况下是可以的。有些落后村，问题复杂村，即用此种简单的方法推动不开，因为有拌脚石，这就必须依据该村的具体情况，把阻碍生产的严重问题，加以解决，方能顺利发展。五区王白堙、郝家瑙、七区山峡，四区曹村大部如此。首先是党内团结与干群关系以及土改中遗留问题等，若不加以具体解决，所谓典型推动一般便成为空喊。
    其次是骨干问题，在生产运动中，必须注意培养积极分子，掌握大批积极分子（党内的党外的）才能去推动工作。包办代替的作风，或者把工作只放在少数主干身上，是不能解决问题，典型推动一般也不可能。
