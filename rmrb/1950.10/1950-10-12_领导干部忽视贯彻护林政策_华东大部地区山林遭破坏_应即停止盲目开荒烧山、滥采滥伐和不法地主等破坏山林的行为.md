Leading Cadres Neglect to Implement Forest Protection Policies
Forests in Most Parts of East China Damaged
Acts such as Blind Land Reclamation by Burning, Indiscriminate Logging, and Unlawful Landlords Destroying Forests Must Be Stopped Immediately

[This Newspaper's Report] The forest protection work in most provinces and regions of East China has not been universally and thoroughly implemented, causing forest damage in many areas, resulting in soil erosion and mountain floods that harm farmland. Since this spring, thanks to the call and leadership of the people's governments at all levels, the afforestation in East China has been successful. In spring alone, 104,507,039 trees were planted, exceeding the annual afforestation plan. However, except for Shandong, which has paid attention to the lessons learned from past forest destruction and has a higher degree of mass awareness, basically stopping the destruction, the other provinces and regions have not given it universal attention, and the situation of forest destruction is still quite serious. According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central People's Government, from January to June this year, there were 40 incidents of forest destruction in East China, destroying a total of 3,860 mu of mountain forests, damaging 4,038,800 trees, and 10,312,000 jin of timber. The actual figures that have not been collected may be several times larger. Based on various materials, the specific situations of forest destruction are as follows: (1) Blind Land Reclamation by Burning. It is entirely correct for the People's Government to promote land reclamation to expand the cultivated area, and it has achieved results. However, some places did not adequately publicize the policy of land reclamation for production, and lacked specific plans and inspections during implementation. As a result, there were phenomena of the masses or individual troops blindly burning mountains for land reclamation, so that many steep slopes and forests unsuitable for cultivation were also reclaimed, and even caused forest fires. This situation is particularly serious in Zhejiang, southern Anhui, and southern Jiangsu. Burning mountains for land reclamation is very common in Xuancheng and Huizhou Prefectures in southern Anhui, and reclamation is often carried out on steep slopes of 30 to 70 degrees, resulting in cases of people and animals falling and being injured. (2) Mass Logging. Some people mistakenly believe that after liberation, forests cannot be privately owned, and arbitrarily cut down trees. Some people think that chopping firewood is easier than other production methods, and regard chopping firewood as the main method of production. Some cadres (including cadres at all levels) have one-sided views of the masses and adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards mass logging. In Songyang County, Zhejiang, after the Spring Festival this year, the forests of many public and private mountains were continuously damaged. According to the investigation, 14 forests in Yangxi Township, District 1, have been damaged. The forests around Dongyang Pavilion in Wuxingshan Village were almost completely cut down. The forest jointly owned by the Ye, Chen, Liu, and Wang families in Daping Mountain, Guanxi Village, lost more than 4 million jin of trees. It is estimated that the total loss of the township is more than 10 million jin. In the mausoleum area of ​​Wuxian County, southern Jiangsu, incidents of stealing and felling trees occurred continuously in March and April this year. According to preliminary statistics, 5,167 trees have been cut down in Shangzhan, Huangqiao and other twelve townships. Most of the felled trees were used as fuel or piled on the field without use, except for a small part used for repairing farm tools. (3) Bandits, special agents, and unlawful landlords incited the masses to indiscriminate logging. After the Lin'an Prefectural Office in Zhejiang took over the Yuhang Forest Farm, it only managed the farm and not the forest farm. Fifty-four million 30-year-old trees were destroyed by the local people instigated by bandits and special agents. On March 15 this year, more than 500 people in Xinnong Village, Qingming Township, Mudu District, Wuxian County, southern Jiangsu, and more than 100 people in Xinqiao, Dongshan District, forcibly cut down more than 1,000 mu of farmers' mountain forests on the south slope of Qingming Mountain under the instigation of the pseudo-chief Lu Quansheng and the unlawful landlord Gu Yusheng, causing farmers to doubt the government's policies and causing anxiety in production. The district government arrested the main culprits on the one hand, and ordered the landlords to return the trees they had felled and mobilized the poor and middle peasants to compensate the poor peasants whose trees had been felled, and the matter was settled. Song Linyun, a landlord in Helin Township, District 6, Jiangning County, southern Jiangsu, cut down more than 2,000 ten-year-old trees from last year's rent reduction to the beginning of this summer. However, the local government still did not deal with this matter until April. (4) Indiscriminate logging. There are six large and small logging companies in Taiping and Jingxian Counties in southern Anhui, purchasing timber and hiring people to cut down trees, forming a phenomenon of destroying forests. Some organs and troops of the Wenzhou Military Region cut firewood and lumbered in production, cutting down more than 240,000 jin in total.

Although there are various reasons for forest destruction, the main reason is that some leading cadres do not have enough understanding of the long-term interests of forests, and therefore neglect to conduct forest protection education among the masses. At the same time, they have adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards the destructive behaviors that have occurred, allowing bandits, special agents, and unlawful landlords to take advantage of them, causing undue damage to the mountains and forests.

After the forests are damaged, the soil water storage capacity is greatly reduced, and at the same time, soil erosion fills the riverbed, which can easily cause floods. In Jiangshan County, Zhejiang, after a heavy rain on May 27, mountain floods broke out, and the river water rose sharply, breaking ten railway bridges. After the Puyang River flood broke out, the dikes broke, submerging more than 600,000 mu of farmland.

Facts have proved that as long as the leaders pay attention and mobilize the masses, forest protection work can be done well. This year, Shandong's task of closing mountains for afforestation is 600,000 mu, focusing on the Yi-Lu mountainous area in central and southern Shandong. At present, the task is close to completion. Before closing the mountains for afforestation, the leaders first properly equipped cadres, formed mobile work teams, went deep into the countryside to widely carry out publicity and education on closing mountains for afforestation and forest protection, organized forest protection groups, and formed forest protection committees by the local government, relevant forest farm cadres, and representatives of forest protection groups. At the same time, they surveyed the mountain land and the population and economic conditions of nearby villages, solicited opinions from the masses, and decided on the closed mountain areas, pastures, and pastoral roads. Later, in cooperation with the local government, forest protection conventions and tasks were democratically stipulated at mass meetings. During the period of mountain closure, the masses must notify the forest protection committee before chopping firewood and cutting grass. The forest protection groups often supervise and criticize each other in protecting forest work; the forest protection committee also makes timely inspections. Protecting forests has become a part of the masses' lives, so Shandong's forest protection achievements are better.

　　领导干部忽视贯彻护林政策
    华东大部地区山林遭破坏
    应即停止盲目开荒烧山、滥采滥伐和不法地主等破坏山林的行为
    【本报讯】华东区多数省区护林工作未能普遍深入贯彻，使不少地区的山林仍在遭受破坏，以致造成土壤冲刷，山洪泛滥为害农田。今春以来，华东区由于各级人民政府的号召与领导，各省区造林是有成绩的，仅春季造林已完成一万万零四百五十万七千零三十九株，超过全年造林计划。但护林方面除山东注意接受了过去破坏森林的教训，群众觉悟程度较高，基本上停止破坏外，其余各省、区均未引起普遍重视，森林破坏的情形仍相当严重。据中央人民政府林垦部根据不完全报告统计；今年上半年（一月至六月）中，华东区先后发生破坏山林事件达四十次，破坏山林的面积共三千八百六十亩，损坏树木四百零三万八千八百株，及木材一千零三十一万二千斤；至于未经收集的实际数字，可能还要大若干倍。综合各方面材料，破坏山林的具体情形有下列几种：（一）盲目开荒烧山。人民政府提倡开荒扩大耕地面积是完全正确的，并收到成绩。但有些地方对开荒生产的政策宣传不够，执行时又缺乏具体计划与检查，于是发生了群众或个别部队盲目烧山开荒的现象，使不少不宜耕作的陡坡和山林也开垦了，甚至引起森林火灾。这种情形尤以浙江、皖南、苏南为严重。皖南宣城及徽州专区烧山开荒很普遍，并且常在三十度到七十度陡坡进行开垦，因而竟发生有人畜跌死摔伤的事例。（二）群众砍伐。有的群众误认为解放后，树林不能私有，任意砍伐。有的群众认为砍柴比其他生产容易，把砍柴作为主要的生产办法。而部分干部（包括各级干部）存在片面的群众观点，对群众砍伐林木采取放任态度。浙江松阳县，今年春节后，许多公山、私山的林木，连续遭到破坏。据调查一区阳溪乡山林已有十四处遭受破坏。乌形山村洞阳亭一带山林几被全部砍光；官溪村大平山叶、陈、刘、王四姓伙有的一处山林，损失林木四百万斤以上。估计该乡全部损失在一千万斤以上。苏南吴县陵墓区，今年三、四月间，连续发生偷砍树木事件，据初步统计：占上、黄桥等十二乡已砍去树木五千一百六十七株。而所砍林木除小部分是用做修理农具外，极大部分作为燃料或者堆在场上没用。（三）匪特、不法地主煽惑群众滥伐。浙江临安专署接收余杭林场后，只管农场不管林场，被匪特鼓动当地群众破坏了三十年生林木五十四万多株。今年三月十五日，苏南吴县木渎区清明乡新农村五百余群众与东山区新桥一百余群众，在伪保长陆泉生、不法地主顾雨生煽动下，强行砍伐清明山南麓的农民山林一千余亩，引起农民对政府政策怀疑，生产情绪不安。经该区政府一面将首恶分子逮捕；一面命令地主和动员贫雇、中农各将其所伐的树木退出，通过群众补偿给树木被砍的贫苦农民，事情始告平息。苏南江宁六区鹤林乡地主宋林云，从去年减租到今年夏初，共砍十年生的树二千多株。但至四月，当地政府仍未处理这件事。（四）滥采滥伐，皖南太平、泾县一带有大小伐木公司六家，收购木材及雇人砍伐，形成破坏森林的现象，温州军分区部分机关部队在生产中发生砍柴，伐木，先后共砍伐了二十四万多斤。
    造成森林破坏的原因虽有种种，但最主要的还是部分领导干部对森林的长远利益认识不够，因而忽视向群众进行护林教育；同时对已发生的破坏行为，采取了放任态度，致使匪特、不法地主有机可乘，造成山林不应有的破坏。
    森林遭受破坏后，土壤蓄水量大减，同时土壤冲刷，充塞河床，很易造成洪水泛滥。浙江江山县在五月二十七日一昼夜大雨后，山洪暴发，江水陡涨，冲断十座铁路桥梁。浦阳江山洪暴发后，堤防决口，淹没了六十余万亩农田。
    事实证明，只要领导重视并发动起群众，护林工作完全可以作好。今年山东分配到的封山育林任务是六十万亩，重点在鲁中南沂鲁山区，至目前任务已接近完成。在封山造林之前，领导上首先妥善配备干部，组成机动工作队，深入乡村广泛进行封山育林和护林的宣传教育工作，组织护林小组，并由当地政府、有关林场干部及护林小组代表组成护林委员会。同时进行勘察山地与附近村庄人口经济情况，征求群众意见，决定封山地区与牧场、牧道。以后再配合当地政府，在群众大会上民主规定护林公约与任务。封山期间，群众打柴，割草得先通知护林委员会。各护林小组对保护森林工作常常互相监督、互相批评；护林委员会也及时作检查。保护森林已成为群众生活的一部分，因此山东的护林成绩较好。
