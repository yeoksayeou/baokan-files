	New Book and Periodical Introductions
	"New Era" Issue 38
	"New Era" Issue 38 has recently arrived in Beijing. The editorial of this issue, titled "Two Plans," compares the Soviet Union's and the New Democratic countries' massive peaceful construction plans with the U.S. imperialists' frantic war plans, thoroughly exposing the hideous face of the aggressors.
	Other important articles include: "A Despicable Competition," "On the 82nd British Trades Union Congress Held in Brighton," etc. There are also two dispatches: "Americans Who Can't Find Work," "Ostrava—A Major Industrial Town in Czechoslovakia." The book review, "Secrets About the Norwegian Press," introduces the new book "Inside the Norwegian Press" by Norwegian progressive writer Kristiansen.
	Finally, it is worth mentioning a letter published in the "Mailbox" section: "'British Ally's' Suicide," written by British progressive journalist R. Parker (author of "The Conspiracy Against Peace") to the editors of "New Era" about the suspension of the Russian-language newspaper "British Ally" published by the British Embassy in the Soviet Union. In this letter, he exposes the British government's conspiracy and refutes the slanders against the Soviet Union regarding this matter.

	"People's Fine Arts" Issue 5
	"People's Fine Arts," the official publication of the National Artists Association, Issue 5, has been published. This issue is richer in content than previous issues. In terms of text, there are more than twenty articles, including special essays, problem discussions, creative experiences, art education, surveys of art heritage, and research on foreign artists and their works. For example, Wang Chaowen's "Correcting Our Creative Style" puts forward many new insights on how to create portraits of leaders and the aesthetic problems of leader portraits. Li Qun's "On the Creation of New Year Pictures" and Jiang Feng's "Problems in the Creations of Students at the National Hangzhou Art College" both offer pertinent views on creative issues. Chang Nadan's "The Historical Realist Painter Surikov" is an abridged and rewritten version of "Surikov, the Russian Painter," by Kemenov, a member of the Soviet Academy of Arts. This article is of great help to us in creating revolutionary historical paintings. Lin Gang's "How We Create Comic Strips" provides a detailed introduction to the experience of collective creation, with many valuable experiences for our creative reference. In addition, there are articles such as "Art Education at Chongqing Yucai School," "The First Stage Educational Experience of the Art Department of the Changsha Workers' Cultural Night School," "The Progress of Workers' Art Works as Seen from the Two Art Exhibitions in Dalian," and "The Improvement and Popularization of Arts and Crafts."
	This issue features a total of twenty-eight pages of art works. The cover is a portrait of Chairman Mao painted by Wang Shikou; inside are eight sketches of combat heroes and labor models drawn by Xu Beihong, Wu Zuoren, and others; Liu Kaiqu's relief sculptures, Gu Yuan's posters, Hu Yichuan's and Ding Zhengxian's oil paintings, Yin Shoushi's, Pan Yun's, and Pan Tianshou's Chinese paintings, etc., totaling seven pieces; eight comic strips by Feng Zhen and others; Surikov's "The Morning of the Streltsy's Execution," "Boyarina Morozova," "Menshikov in Berezov," and his sketches and details, totaling nine pieces; David's "The Coronation of Napoleon" and "The Death of Marat"; in addition, there are portraits and sculptures of Lenin, as well as works by students of Hangzhou Art College and workers from Dalian... All the picture pages and illustrations total about sixty, most of which are relatively mature works or world masterpieces.
	"Literary Gazette" Volume 3, Issue 1
	After a month's break, "Literary Gazette" Volume 3, Issue 1, was published on October 25th. From now on, the publication will focus on literary criticism and literary study. This issue publishes three articles commemorating the 14th anniversary of Lu Xun's death: Hu Qiaomu's "The Achievements We Have Already Reached and Those We Have Not Yet Reached," Xue Feng's "The Talent of Thought and the Talent of Literature," and Zhang Tianyi's "One or Two Questions About Learning from Lu Xun." Ding Ling's "Creation and Life," Fen Lin's "On the Combination of Literary Creation and Policy and Tasks," and Wang Xiyan's "From Improving the Ideological Content of Works to the Tasks of Critics" all provide concrete and profound analyses and explanations of the close relationship between creation and life and policy, as well as the tasks of literary critics. Cao Yu's "My Preliminary Understanding of Future Creation" and articles by Zhu Ding and Bi Ye offer preliminary reviews of their past works. Liu Baiyu's "The Loud Voice of Mayakovsky" and Wu Benli's "Learning from Soviet Filmmakers" well introduce their personal experiences of the attitude and work style of Soviet literary and artistic workers. A. Gonchar's "Always On Duty" is a highly educational short story that has been widely welcomed by Chinese readers. In addition to reprinting the full text, "Literary Gazette" also publishes Li Yu's "'Always On Duty': How it Unfolds its Theme" and Xue Yuan's "'Always On Duty': What it Teaches Us." In addition, there are articles such as Su Ping's "The Gathering of Arts of Fraternal Nationalities," which reports on the participation of the literary and art troupes of various ethnic minorities in the celebration of the founding anniversary in Beijing.

    新书刊介绍
    “新时代”第三十八期
    “新时代”第三十八期最近到京。本期社论题为“两种计划”，以苏联及新民主主义国家的巨大和平建设计划和美帝疯狂的战争计划作了一个对比，彻底揭露了侵略者的狰狞面目。
    其他重要的文章有：“一个卑鄙的竞技”，“论在布利敦召开的英国工会第八十二届大会”等。另外有两篇通讯：“无工作可找的美国”，“捷克工业重镇——奥斯特拉瓦”。书评“关于挪威新闻界的秘闻”，是介绍挪威进步作家克里斯钦逊的新著“挪威新闻界内幕”的。
    最后值得介绍的，是“信箱”栏内发表的一封信：“‘不列颠同盟者’的自杀”，是英国进步记者Ｒ·派克（即“反和平的阴谋”的作者）就英国驻苏大使馆的俄文报纸“不列颠同盟者”的停刊事写给“新时代”编者的。在这封信内，他揭穿了英国政府的阴谋，批驳了因这件事加给苏联的诬蔑。

    全国美协的机关刊物“人民美术”第五期已经出版了。这一期的内容比过去几期更丰富，在文字方面有专论、问题讨论、创作经验、美术教育、美术遗产调查、外国画家及其作品的研究等二十余篇。如王朝闻的“端正我们的创作作风”一文，对如何创作领袖像以及领袖像的美学问题提出了很多新的见解。力群的“论新年画的创作问题”和江丰的“国立杭州艺专同学创作上的问题”两文，对于创作问题均有中肯的见地。常那丹的“现实主义的历史画家苏里柯夫”，根据苏联艺术学院会员凯缅诺夫著的“俄国画家苏里柯夫评传”节译改写而成，该文对于我们创作革命历史画有很大帮助。林岗的“我们怎样创作连环画”详细地介绍了集体创作的经验，其中有不少宝贵的经验可供我们创作上的参考。此外还有“重庆育才学校的美术教育”、“长沙工人文艺夜校美术科第一阶段教育经验”、“从旅大两次美展中看工人美术作品的进步”、“工艺美术的提高和普及”等文。

    “文艺报”三卷一期
    “文艺报”休刊一月后，三卷一期已于十月二十五日出版。今后该刊将以文艺评论与文艺学习为主要内容。本期发表了纪念鲁迅逝世十四周年的文章三篇：胡乔木的“我们所已经达到的和还没有达到的成就”，雪峰的“思想的才能和文学的才能”和张天翼的“关于学习鲁迅的一两个问题”。丁玲的“创作与生活”、芬麟的“论文艺创作与政策和任务相结合”和王西彦的“从提高作品的思想性谈到批评家的任务”三文对于创作和生活和政策的密切关系以及文艺批评家的任务等问题都作了具体而深刻的分析和说明。曹禺的“我对今后创作的初步认识”和朱定、碧野的文章都对自己过去的作品作了初步检讨。刘白羽的“响亮的马耶阔夫斯基的声音”和吴本立的“向苏联电影工作者学习”很好地介绍了他们个人对学习苏联文艺工作者的工作态度和工作作风的体验。Ａ·龚察尔的《永不掉队》是一篇极有教育意义的短篇小说，曾获得广大的中国读者的欢迎。《文艺报》除全文转载外，并登载了李御的“‘永不掉队’怎样展开它的主题”和雪原的“‘永不掉队’给我们的教育”。此外，报道各少数民族文工团这次来北京参加开国周年盛典及其演出的有苏平的“兄弟民族艺术的会师”等文。
