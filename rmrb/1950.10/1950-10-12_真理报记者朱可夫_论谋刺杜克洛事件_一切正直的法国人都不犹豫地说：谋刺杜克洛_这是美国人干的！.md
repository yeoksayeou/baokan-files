Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 10th (TASS): *Pravda* correspondent in Paris, Zhukov, wrote an article discussing the recent provocative action by French reactionaries in attempting to assassinate French Communist Party Secretary Jacques Duclos during a speech at a conference in Auch, Gers. Zhukov wrote: Duclos is a heroic fighter for the people's cause and a revolutionary fighter. For decades, he and Thorez have jointly led the French Communist Party. Reactionaries fear Duclos and hate him. Every time Duclos appears on the podium, it is a fatal threat to the reactionaries. The reactionaries cannot refute his arguments. Precisely for this reason, as American aggressors are increasingly harming progressive leaders, the earliest attack in France was directed at Duclos… Zhukov pointed out that the grenade thrown at Duclos by the fascists, by chance, did not injure Duclos, but lightly injured ten people in the audience; after the injured were sent to the hospital, Duclos continued his speech; the fascists' attempt to disrupt the conference failed.

Zhukov recalled that the recent assassinations of the leaders of the Communist Parties of Italy, Japan, and Belgium are still fresh in people's minds. The police of the various vassal states of the United States, when ordered to attack peace supporters, behave madly; but when they deal with fascist terrorist attacks, they evade and retreat. The assassin who attempted to murder Duclos, therefore, managed to escape.

Zhukov commented that the bourgeois newspapers are trying to portray the attempted assassination of Duclos as a most ordinary violation of the law. Not only that, but the fascist newspaper *l'Aurore*, which kowtows to the American aggressors, openly and unreservedly encourages hired assassins.

Zhukov wrote: Due to the behavior of these pro-American newspapers, those who armed the bandits and sent them to do evil have been completely exposed. All honest French people, while expressing their deep anger, point to the cannibal Dulles—who long ago came to France with a public plan to physically eliminate the leaders of progressive organizations in Western Europe. Now all honest French people say without hesitation: "The attempted assassination of Duclos—the Americans did it!" The attempted assassination of Duclos has aroused the increasing anger of the progressive public in France. Because this is not an isolated action, it is only part of a systematic large-scale fascist terrorist movement. In the past six months alone, more than 20 terrorist acts against progressive organizations have occurred in France, and all these terrorist acts have not been punished to this day because of the authorities' protection.

Zhukov then listed many terrorist acts that have occurred in the past two months alone to assassinate democratic leaders, and concluded by saying that all these open atrocities committed by the reactionaries are reminiscent of the activities of Hitler's Brownshirts in Germany in the 1930s, and there is no doubt that these atrocities are carried out according to a long-established plan. The fascists, encouraged by complete impunity, are trying to intimidate the people, thereby paving the way for the establishment of a fascist dictatorship in France. Zhukov pointed out that as the reporter was writing, working people across France were holding rallies to protest the impunity of fascist terrorists and demand the arrest and punishment of the bandits who attempted to assassinate Duclos. The working people vowed to raise their vigilance.

    论谋刺杜克洛事件
    一切正直的法国人都不犹豫地说：谋刺杜克洛——这是美国人干的！
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十日电：真理报驻巴黎记者朱可夫撰文论述最近法国反动派于法国共产党书记杜克洛在席尔省奥什市一次大会中演说时谋刺杜克洛的挑衅性行动。朱可夫写道：杜无洛是人民事业的英勇战士，是革命的斗士。他过去数十年来，和多列士共同领导着法国共产党。反动派畏惧杜克洛也仇恨杜克洛。杜克洛每次出现于讲台，对于反动派就象是致命的威胁。反动派无法驳覆他的议论。正因为这一点，所以当美国侵略者日益频繁地谋害进步领袖时，在法国最早的一次攻击便指向了杜克洛……朱可夫指出：法西斯分子投向杜克洛的手榴弹，意外地没有伤着杜克洛，使听众中十人受了轻伤；待伤者送往医院后，杜克洛继续演说；法西斯分子破坏大会的企图未能得逞。
    朱可夫追述称：前不久谋害意大利、日本、比利时各国共产党领袖的事件，在人们心中记忆犹新。美国各附庸国的警察，当受命攻击和平拥护者时，表现得丧心病狂；但当他们处理法西斯恐怖袭击时，却又回避不前。谋刺杜克洛的凶手，因此而竟得逃逸。
    朱可夫评称：资产阶级的报纸力图把这个谋刺杜克洛的事件说成一个最普通的违警案件。不仅如此，在美国侵略者面前卑躬屈膝的法西斯报纸震旦报还公然无隐地鼓励受雇的暗杀凶手。
    朱可夫写道：由于亲美报纸的这种行为，那些把匪徒们武装起来并派他们去为非作歹的人们已被暴露无余了。一切正直的法国人在表示他们深切的愤怒时，都指着吃人生番杜勒斯，——他很久以前就曾带着肉体消灭西欧进步组织领袖的公开计划到法国来。现在一切正直的法国人都毫不犹豫地说：“谋刺杜克洛——这是美国人干的”。谋刺杜克洛的事件引起法国进步公众的日益增多的愤怒。因为这并不是一个孤立的行动，这只是有系统进行的大规模法西斯恐怖运动的一部分。单在过去半年中，在法国就发生了二十多件针对进步组织的恐怖行动，而且所有这些恐怖行动都因为当局的包庇迄今未受惩处。
    朱可夫继而列举了单在过去两月中所发生的许多谋害民主领袖的恐怖行动，并在结语中称，反动派所进行的这一切公开的暴行使人想起德国的希特勒褐衫队在三十年代中的活动，而且毫无疑义这些暴行是根据制定已久的计划来执行的。法西斯分子受到完全不受惩办的鼓励，力图恫吓人民，从而为在法国建立法西斯独裁铺平道路。朱可夫指出：在记者执笔时，法国各地的劳动人民正在举行集会，抗议法西斯恐怖分子的消遥法外，要求缉拿并惩办那些谋刺杜克洛的匪徒。劳动人民誓言要提高他们的警觉性。
