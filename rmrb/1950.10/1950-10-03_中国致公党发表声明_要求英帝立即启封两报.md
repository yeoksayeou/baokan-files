Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The China Zhi Gong Party issued a statement on the 29th, protesting the unreasonable closure of patriotic newspapers of overseas Chinese in Nanyang by the British colonial authorities in Malaya as follows:

The British colonial authorities in Malaya have been persecuting overseas Chinese residing there in every possible way. Recently, on September 21st, they even closed down the "Nanyang Siang Pau" in Singapore and the "Modern Daily" in Penang, and arrested the general manager and editor-in-chief of the Nanyang Siang Pau. Such arrogant and tyrannical behavior is truly intolerable to the people of our country and all peace-loving and democratic people in the world.

"Nanyang Siang Pau" and "Modern Daily" are patriotic newspapers founded by patriotic overseas Chinese, and the only mouthpiece for the overseas Chinese in Nanyang. The British imperialists dared to obliterate the opinions of our overseas Chinese and unreasonably closed the two newspapers. This barbaric attitude is enough to arouse the deep hatred of the people of our country, and the British imperialists' daily claims of being a democratic country and being friendly to our country will be bankrupt because of this. At the same time, it also deeply makes our compatriots more aware that imperialists are enemies of the people everywhere.

We firmly protest against this anti-people behavior of the British colonial authorities in Malaya, and demand the immediate unsealing of the two newspapers, the release of the illegally detained staff of the Nanyang Siang Pau, and a guarantee that such incidents will not happen again in the future. If the British imperialists remain stubborn, they shall be responsible for all the consequences.

　　中国致公党发表声明
    要求英帝立即启封两报
    【新华社二十九日讯】中国致公党于二十九日发表声明，抗议马来亚英国殖民当局无理封闭我南洋华侨爱国报纸如下：
    马来亚英国殖民当局百般迫害我国留居该地华侨，最近，九月二十一日，竟将新加坡的《南侨日报》和槟榔屿的《现代日报》封闭，并逮捕了南侨日报的总经理以及总编辑。这种狂妄横暴的行为，实在是我国人民以及全世界爱好和平民主的人民所不能容忍的。
    《南侨日报》和《现代日报》是华侨爱国人士所创办的爱国报纸，为南洋侨胞唯一喉舌，英帝国主义者竟敢抹煞我侨胞舆论，无理地将两报封闭。这种蛮横态度，实足以激起我全国人民的深切痛恨，而英帝国主义者天天宣称自己是民主国以及与我国友好等等幌子，将更因此而破产，同时也深深使我同胞更加明白帝国主义者是处处和人民为敌的。
    我们坚决抗议马来亚英殖民当局这种反人民的行为，并要求立即启封两报，释放非法拘押的南侨日报工作人员，更须保证今后不再有此种事件发生。英国帝国主义者若仍执迷不悟，一切后果，均应由其负责。
