　　In One Year of Operations in the Hanoi Theater
    Vietnamese People's Army Annihilates Nearly 30,000 Enemy Troops
    British "Worker's Daily" Reveals U.S. Forcing Britain to Participate in the War of Aggression Against Vietnam
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, 29th] Telecommunications Agency, Yangon, 27th: In the past year, up to August 19, 1950, the Vietnamese People's Army in the Hanoi theater killed and captured more than 28,000 French soldiers. The People's Army also destroyed 124 enemy artillery pieces, 32 locomotives, 25 aircraft, 200 machine guns, 7,000 mortar shells, more than 1.25 million cubic liters of gasoline, 250,000 cubic liters of machine oil, and 66 tons of various equipment and grain.
    [Xinhua News Agency, London, 29th] TASS, London, 27th: The "Worker's Daily" commentator and Far East expert, Klegg, wrote that, due to pressure from the United States, Britain may be drawn into the war waged by French imperialists in Vietnam. Klegg said: For a long time, the United States has given general instructions on the Vietnam War; since this year, it has completely controlled it. In Vietnam, besides the U.S. embassy staff, there is also a 40-man U.S. military mission commanding the French. The French army and the Bao Dai puppet government's troops are now gradually receiving more U.S. military supplies.
    Klegg emphasized: The French army in Vietnam is facing a more dangerous situation due to the People's Army's offensive. In August of this year, at the instigation of the United States, U.S. military attaché in Saigon, Colonel Harris, Chief of Staff of the British ground forces in Malaya, Major General Boett, and several British and French officers, had already laid the "foundation for full cooperation between Britain and France."
    Klegg concluded: We must be vigilant to prevent the British, under pressure from the United States, from being thrown into this base war to their deaths.

　　河内战区作战一年中
    越人民军歼敌近三万
    英工人日报揭露美正迫使英国参加侵越战争
    【新华社二十九日讯】电通社仰光二十七日讯：截至一九五○年八月十九日为止的过去一年中，越南人民军在河内战区共击毙和俘获法军士兵二万八千余人。人民军部队并摧毁敌大炮一百二十四门，火车头三十二个，飞机二十五架，机关枪两百挺，迫击炮弹七千发，汔油一百二十五万余立方公升，机器油二十五万立方公升以及各种装备和粮食六十六吨。
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十七日讯：工人日报评论员远东问题专家克莱格撰文说：由于美国的压力，英国可能被牵入法帝国主义者在越南所进行的战争。克莱格说：很久以来，美国即对越南战争给予一般性的指示，本年以来，即已完全予以控制。在越南指挥法国人的，除美国使馆人员外，还有一个四十人的美国军事使团。法军和保大傀儡政府的军队，现在正逐渐获得更多的美国军火。
    克莱格着重指出：法军在越南面临人民军的攻势，处境已经更为险恶。本年八月间，在美国的怂恿下，美国驻西贡武官哈利斯上校，英国驻马来亚地面部队参谋长波埃特少将以及英、法军官多人，已预先奠定“英法两国通力合作的基础”。
    克莱格在结语中写道：我们必须警惕，以免英国人在美国的压力下，被投入这一个卑污的战争中去送命。
