The CCP Henan Provincial Committee Instructs All Counties:
　　Rectification at and Below the County Level Should Emphasize Both Rectification and Work

[This newspaper reports] Currently, the rectification in nine regions of Henan Province has concluded. The rectification in Kaifeng and Zhengzhou cities, as well as Nanyang region, is nearing completion. The rectification movement in most counties has already begun, and some areas have gained experience. Based on the existing rectification experience and the specific circumstances of each county, the Provincial Committee has put forward opinions on carrying out the rectification movement at and below the county level.

Regarding the time arrangement for rectification and work, the Provincial Committee pointed out that, as autumn harvesting, autumn planting, and preparations for land reform are currently underway, rectification should emphasize both rectification and adherence to work. Rectification meetings can be conducted in two or three phases. The first phase should concentrate on key cadres from the county and district levels, leaving a small number of key personnel to adhere to work. General township cadres and new cadres should not participate or participate less. A standing committee member of the county committee should remain to preside over daily work, while the rest should concentrate all their efforts on participating in and leading the rectification. Rectification in organizations directly under the regional committee can be postponed. Cadres should focus on going to various counties to help with rectification, and understand and check the preparations for land reform and the disaster situation. The second and third phases of the rectification meetings should primarily involve new cadres and township cadres; the meetings can be transformed into short-term training courses. One county committee member should remain at home to lead the rectification, while most county committee members can go down to help with work separately. In this way, neither rectification nor work will be affected.

Regarding the methods for carrying out rectification: This rectification is short in duration and the cadres' level is low. Many comrades still cannot understand the documents. Therefore, the documents to be studied should be few but精 (精 means refined, essential), mainly studying Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session and the summary of the Fourth Provincial Party Congress. The study method should mainly adopt explanation, but it should not be like giving a long report all at once. It should be that whatever problem is being rectified, that document should be explained. It is mainly to extract relevant parts and explain that part when the problem is discussed. Especially in the second and third phases, more class-style teaching should be used to enlighten (but it should not deviate from summarizing work), repeatedly clarifying the principles to improve the cadres' political consciousness and reduce blindness.

At the same time, the Provincial Committee emphatically pointed out that the key and crucial issues should be grasped in the rectification for examination. This is mainly to achieve the purpose of improving the policy level and improving the work style through checking and summarizing the work, carrying out criticism and self-criticism. The county committee should make a good guiding report on checking the key issues in the work of the county, and lead the self-criticism from top to bottom. The inspirational report should be brief and clear, with both principles and specific materials, and the discussion and explanation should complement each other. In discussing and checking the work, the county committee should grasp the key issues discussed by everyone at any time, and specifically help analyze to improve understanding. In the analysis, the method of contrasting good and bad examples should be adopted to affirm the advantages and criticize the errors; at the same time, prevent only checking the shortcomings and errors, not seeing the achievements, negating the achievements, and thus damaging the confidence in the work. And to strengthen ideological leadership, at any time to correct the attitude of rectification, to prevent only checking the leadership, not checking themselves, or checking themselves and deviating from summarizing the work, falling into the circle of life details.

The Provincial Committee also pointed out, according to the experience of Zhengzhou and Xuchang, in the rectification, in addition to finding out the roots and overcoming the methods of bureaucracy and formalism through the inspection of the main work, the problem of understanding the current affairs and the policy of protecting the rich peasant economy in the Land Reform Law also needs to be solved with great efforts. The method is also to collect materials in advance, make an inspirational report, and then go from stating the situation to solving the problem. The main thing is to correctly understand the current situation from the basic viewpoint of the strength of the current peace forces and the lack of prospects for US imperialism to launch a war of aggression. Correctly understand the policy of preserving the rich peasant economy from the viewpoint of developing production and isolating the landlord class. And study how to improve the thinking of the people's representatives and peasants in the district and township after going back.

The Provincial Committee also pointed out: In the rectification, we should also pay attention to the combination of democracy within the Party and democracy outside the Party. We should report work, check shortcomings and mistakes, openly conduct criticism and self-criticism at the congresses of all circles and the people's congresses of districts and townships, mobilize the masses and non-Party people to offer opinions, supervise the leadership, and supervise the cadres; and through them, implement policies and improve the ideological awareness of the masses. Only in this way can we better unite the broad masses of people, divide the landlord class, and create favorable conditions for land reform and future production.

　　中共河南省委指示各县
    县以下整风要与工作并重
    【本报讯】目前河南省有九个地委整风已经结束，开封、郑州两市与南阳地委整风也将近结束，大部分县的整风运动业已开始，部分地区已获得经验。该省省委特根据已有整风经验与各县具体情况，对正在开展的县以下的整风运动，提出进行整风的意见。
    在整风与工作的时间安排上，省委指出因目前正在进行秋收、秋种与准备土改工作，因而整风要与坚持工作并重。整风会议可分两、三期进行。第一期集中县区主要干部，留下少数骨干坚持工作，一般乡干部、新干部不参加或少参加。县委留一常委主持日常工作，其余的集中全力参加与领导整风；地委直属机关整风可以推迟，干部有重点的到各县帮助整风，并了解与检查土地改革准备情况和灾情。第二、三期整风会议，参加的人主要是新干部、乡干部；会议可变为短期训练班性质。留一县委在家领导整风，大部分县委可分头下去帮助工作。这样整风与工作都不会受影响。
    关于整风进行的方法：这次整风时间短，干部水平低，有很多同志还看不懂文件，所以学习的文件应规定得少而精，主要学习毛主席三中全会上的报告与省四次党代会总结。学习方法多采用讲解方式，但又不能像作大报告的一次讲完。应该是整什么问题，就讲什么文件。主要是摘取有关部分，讨论到那一问题就讲那一部分。特别是二期、三期更应多用上课启发方式（但也不能脱离总结工作），反复说清道理与原则，以提高干部政治自觉，减少盲目性。
    同时省委着重指出，整风中要掌握住重点与关键问题进行检查。这主要是通过检查总结工作，开展批评与自我批评，达到提高政策水平，改进作风的目的。县委根据本县工作中几个主要问题，作好检查领导的启发报告，引向自上而下的开展批评和自我批评。启发报告应简短明确，有原则也有具体材料，讨论与讲解相辅而行。讨论检查工作中，县委要随时抓住大家讨论的关键问题，具体帮助分析以提高认识。在分析时，要采取好坏典型对比方法，肯定优点，批判错误；同时要防止光检查缺点错误，看不到成绩，否定成绩，而致伤害工作信心。并要加强思想领导，随时端正整风态度，防止光检查领导，不检查自己，或检查自己而脱离总结工作，陷入生活细节的圈子。
    省委并根据郑州、许昌两地经验指出，整风中，各县除通过主要工作检查官僚主义与形式主义，找出根源与克服办法外，对时事与土地改革法中保护富农经济政策的认识问题也需用大力解决。方法也是事先搜集材料，作启发报告，然后由摆情况到解决问题。主要是从目前和平力量的强大与美帝国主义发动侵略战争无前途等基本观点出发，正确的认识目前的时局。从发展生产、孤立地主观点出发正确认识保存富农经济政策。并研究回去如何提高区乡人民代表与农民的思想。
    省委并指出：整风中还要注意党内民主与党外民主相结合问题。要在各界代表会、区乡人民代表会上报告工作，检查缺点错误，公开进行批评与自我批评，发动群众与党外人士提意见、监督领导、监督干部；并通过他们贯彻政策，提高群众思想觉悟。只有这样，才能更好的团结广大群众，分化地主阶级，给土地改革与今后生产创造有利条件。
