    Severely Punish the Arch-Criminals of Counter-Revolution
    Zhang Dexiang and Two Other Bandits Executed by Firing Squad in Fangshan
    [This News Report] The People's Court of Fangshan County, Hebei Province, sentenced counter-revolutionary murderers Zhang Dexiang and Wang Lanting to death. The sentences were reviewed and approved by the People's Government of Hebei Province, and the executions by firing squad were carried out. Zhang Dexiang was originally a soldier and ruffian in the bandit army and a member of the Kuomintang. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, he joined Kong Xianjiang's bandit gang as a messenger. Later, he followed Kong in surrendering to the Japanese invaders, serving as a company commander and battalion commander. After Kong's bandit gang was killed by our army, Zhang continued as a regimental commander, committing numerous evils. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, his unit was reorganized by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits into the "People's Self-Defense Force," and Zhang continued to serve as the general captain and commander of the 33rd Regiment of the pseudo-provincial security force. This criminal was consistently an enemy of the people, extremely vicious and cruel. Seventy-seven of our Fangshan County, district, and village cadres and people were killed by him. His methods of killing were extremely cruel, earning him the nickname "Living King of Hell." Ma Wenliang, the head of our county's Public Security Section, was boiled to death by him in boiling water; investigator Bai Deshan had his ears, nose, and tongue cut off before being scraped to death with a knife; and Huang Wenru of the district committee was hacked to death with a knife. The people of the county hated him to the bone and reported his crimes to our People's Government. A total of 168 out of 208 villages in the county submitted indictments as village units, 93 indictments were submitted by families of victims, and 9 indictments were submitted by other counties. Counter-revolutionary murderer Wang Lanting served as the special agent captain of the Japanese Military Police in Fangshan, Lai, and Zhuo counties during the Japanese occupation, committing all kinds of evil deeds, including raping, killing, and looting. He captured and killed 24 of our army's cadres and people. This criminal once used the accusation of "being in communication with the Eighth Route Army" to have Cui Xingmin, a teacher from Xinzhuang, blinded with bamboo needles. Cui Fengting from Huinanzhuang and Zhou Dejiu from Dayugou were suffocated to death with urine during torture. Chang Shouwen, the district committee secretary of Zhenjiangying, was killed with a bayonet. A total of five women were seized and kept as concubines. The amount of property extorted is countless. Before the Japanese invaders surrendered, this criminal arrested two people every day, accusing them of being "Eighth Route Army" members and handing them over to the Japanese invaders in order to win the enemy's favor. He also conscripted three or four times for the enemy, each time about 200 people, and sent them to Hokkaido, Japan, to serve as laborers. Many of them were brutally abused and died on the way. The facts of this criminal's crimes are well known to everyone in Fangshan, Lai, and Zhuo counties, and everyone grinds their teeth in hatred. When the Fangshan County People's Government executed these two criminals by firing squad, it also held a mass rally to publicize the policy of suppressing reactionaries, which changed the masses' perception that the government was "boundlessly lenient."

    严惩反革命首恶分子
    房山枪决张德祥等两匪
    【本报讯】河北房山县人民法院判处反革命杀人罪犯张德祥、王兰亭死刑，经河北省人民政府复核批准执行枪决。张德祥原系匪军兵痞，国民党员。抗战后，参加孔宪江匪部当传达长。后随孔投降日寇，任连长、大队长。孔匪被我军击毙后，张匪继任联队长作恶多端。日寇投降后，该部被蒋匪改编为“民众自卫队”，张匪又连任总队长与伪省保安三十三团团长等职。该犯一贯与人民为敌，穷凶极恶，我房山县、区、村干部与群众被其杀害者达七十七人。其杀人手段极为残酷，人称“活阎王”。我县公安股长马文亮，被他用沸水煮死；侦查员白德山被他先割下耳、鼻、舌等又用刀刮死；区委黄文如被他用刀劈死。该县群众恨之入骨，纷纷向我人民政府控告其罪行。该县共二○八村，以村为单位陈递控状者共一六八份，被难家属控告者九三份，外县控诉者九份。反革命杀人犯王兰亭，在日寇统治时任房、涞、涿三县日本宪兵队特务队长，奸杀抢掠，无所不为，捕杀我军干部与群众二十四人。该犯曾以“通八路”为名，将辛庄教员崔醒民用竹针钉双目致死。惠南庄崔凤亭、大峪沟周德九被其在刑讯中用尿灌死。镇江营区委常守文被其用刺刀挑死。妇女被其霸占为妾者共五人。勒索财物之多，难以数计。日寇投降前，该犯每日要逮捕二人，加以“八路军”罪名送交日寇，借以博取敌人欢心。并为敌人抓丁三、四次，每次约计二百余名，送往日本北海道充当劳工。其中许多人被残酷虐待死于途中。该犯罪恶事实，在房、涞、涿三县，妇孺皆知，人人切齿。房山县人民政府将该二犯执行枪决时，并召开群众大会，宣讲镇压反动分子的政策，转变了群众认为政府“宽大无边”的认识。（通讯员冯加骏、王兆民、庄敬伯）
