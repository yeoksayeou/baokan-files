Xinhua News Agency, 19th. The Ministry of Trade and the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government recently issued a joint directive to their respective departments regarding the implementation of cotton-grain price ratio standards, premium prices for premium cotton, and the determination of seed cotton prices. The directive stated: After the new cotton crop is put on the market in various regions, in the border areas between provinces and in some inland markets, cotton prices are lower than market prices; in cotton-producing concentration areas, especially those without grain companies, grain prices are higher. As a result, the cotton-grain price ratio in some areas is lower than the government-stipulated ratio. Compared with ginned cotton prices, seed cotton prices are too low, which makes cotton farmers unwilling to sell seed cotton. Regarding fiber length and quality, many regions have not strictly graded, causing cotton farmers to think that it is more cost-effective to sell good and bad cotton mixed together than to sell them separately. The directive pointed out that all of this will affect cotton quality and the expansion of cotton fields and the promotion of improved varieties next year. To this end, the directive requires all regions to conscientiously implement the cotton-grain price ratio standards stipulated by the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation's Managerial Conference, and must not be lower than the minimum price ratio, and strive to make the listed price consistent with the market price. It is necessary to resolutely implement the government's policy of rewarding cotton production improvement with premium prices for premium cotton, and quickly correct the deviations in the failure to strictly implement grading. The directive pointed out: Determining the price of seed cotton should be based on the principle that "it is more profitable for the masses to sell seed cotton than to sell ginned cotton." It is necessary to conscientiously implement the decision that "improved seed cotton of all grades will be priced an additional 4 percent according to the original grade." After the price increase, it must be higher than the price of ordinary seed cotton in order to achieve the goal of controlling a large amount of improved varieties.

　　中央贸易农业两部联合发布指示
    贯彻棉粮比价标准确定籽棉价格
    【新华社十九日讯】中央人民政府贸易部与农业部顷向所属发出关于贯彻棉粮比价标准、优棉优价及确定籽棉价格的联合指示。指示说：各地新棉上市后，在各省邻境之交接地区及某些内地市场上，棉花牌价低于市价；棉产集中地区，特别是没有粮食公司者，粮价较高，因而部分地区棉粮比价有低于政府规定的情况；籽棉与皮棉价格相较，籽棉价偏低，以致棉农不愿出卖籽棉；在纤维长度、品质上，许多地区未严格分级，因而使棉农产生好坏棉分卖不如混卖合算的想法。指示指出，凡此都将影响棉花质量及明年棉田的扩大及良种推广。为此，指示要求各地必须确实贯彻中国花纱布公司经理会议规定的棉粮比价标准，不得低于最低比价，并要努力做到牌价与市价趋于一致；必须坚决贯彻执行政府奖励棉产改进的优棉优价政策，迅速纠正未严格执行分级的偏差。指示指出：确定籽棉价格，应以“群众卖籽棉比卖皮棉有利”为原则；要认真执行“良种籽棉一律按原等级另加价百分之四”的决定，加价后，必须高于普通籽棉价格，以达到大量控制良种的目的。
