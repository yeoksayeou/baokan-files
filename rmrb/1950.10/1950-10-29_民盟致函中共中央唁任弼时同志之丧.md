To the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party:

We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Mr. Ren Bishi, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Secretary of the Secretariat of your esteemed party, in Beijing. Mr. Bishi was one of the earliest members and organizers of the vanguard of the Chinese working class – the Chinese Communist Party. Throughout his life of arduous struggle for the cause of the Chinese people's revolution, he left indelible meritorious achievements and won the love of the people nationwide. To compensate for the loss caused by his unfortunate passing, we are determined to call on all members of the League to transform grief into strength, closely unite under the banner of the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, strive to learn from Mr. Bishi's great revolutionary fighting spirit, and fight against American imperialist aggression and for the consolidation and development of the people's victory.

Respectfully,
Zhang Lan, Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun, Zhang Dongsun, Huang Yanpei, Luo Longji, Ma Xulun, Peng Zemin, Shi Liang, Zhou Xinmin and others of the China Democratic League.
