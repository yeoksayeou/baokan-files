　　North China Military Region Troops
    Ninety-Six Percent Participate in Peace Signature Campaign
    [Xinhua News Agency, 4th] The peace signature campaign of the People's Liberation Army's North China Military Region troops has concluded victoriously. The number of signatories accounts for over ninety-six percent of the total number of personnel, with only a small number of units stationed in overly dispersed locations and personnel who were away not participating in the signature campaign. Many units in the Pingyuan Provincial Military Region held solemn and grand peace oath-taking rallies, and invited local residents to participate, inspiring their enthusiasm for participating in the peace signature campaign. Many soldiers also mobilized family members who came to visit the troops to sign the petition. Through this peace signature campaign, the troops have further strengthened their patriotic and internationalist education, and made the soldiers more determined to defend the motherland and safeguard world peace.

　　华北军区部队
    百分之九十六参加和平签名
    【新华社四日讯】人民解放军华北军区部队和平签名运动已胜利结束，签名人数占总人数百分之九十六强，仅有少数驻地过于分散的单位和外出人员没有参加签名。平原省军区不少单位曾举行庄严隆重的和平宣誓大会，并邀请驻地居民群众参加，启发了他们参加和平签名的积极性。很多战士还动员了来队探望的家属签名。部队经过这次和平签名运动，进一步加强了爱国主义和国际主义的教育，使战士们更坚定了保卫祖国、捍卫世界和平的战斗决心。
