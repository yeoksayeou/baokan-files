    A Suggestion from Comrade Zheng Xiangchang: Writers Should Rewrite the Deeds of Heroes and Models into Lively Popular Readings

    To the Editors:
    I have carefully read the introductions of the representatives to the National Conference of Combat Heroes and the National Conference of Labor Models published in the newspaper. Their heroic deeds inspire me and captivate me. I suggest that Xinhua Bookstore compile the important documents from these two conferences and the introductions of the heroes and models into a separate book for everyone to study. I also hope that writers will rewrite these materials into lively popular readings.

　　希望作家们把英模事迹改写成生动的通俗读物
    郑相昌同志来信建议编辑同志：
    报纸上所发表的全国战斗英雄代表会议和全国劳动模范代表会议的代表介绍，我都详细地阅读了。他们的英勇事迹，鼓舞着我，使我手不释卷。我建议新华书店把这二个会议的重要文件和英雄模范的介绍汇集一下，出一个单行本，以供大家学习。并希望作家们把这些材料改写成生动的通俗读物。
