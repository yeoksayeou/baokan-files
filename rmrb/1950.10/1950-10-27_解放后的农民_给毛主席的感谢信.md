　　The Liberated Peasants'
    Letter of Gratitude to Chairman Mao
    (I) Respected Chairman Mao:
    As we joyfully celebrate the successful completion of land reform, we think of you again.
    Before, we poor people had no land to till and suffered under the oppression of the landlords. Land rent and usurious loans squeezed the very breath out of us. We worked for the landlords during the day, and could only do our own work at night. We lacked food and clothing, and our lives were too bitter!
    Fortunately, we have you, our respected Chairman Mao. We working people have stood up. You led the People's Liberation Army to liberate us, and then led us to develop production and overcome disasters; now you are calling on us to carry out land reform. All the peasants in our township, following your words, have united closely, neutralized the rich peasants, and eliminated the feudal exploitation of the landlord class. This time, our whole township confiscated and requisitioned 5,100 mu of land, and each hired poor and middle peasant received three mu of land. Appropriate consideration was also given to the original farmers when distributing the land.
    Before, we trod on other people's land and lived under other people's roofs, not daring to voice our suffering or shed our tears. Now things have changed. We have all escaped from hell. For years, we didn't know what "smiling" meant, but today we are all smiling!
    In the past, we all believed that poverty was our fate; now we are no longer poor, and we should thank you and the Communist Party for this. In the future, under your leadership, we must unite even more closely, apply more fertilizer, cultivate deeply and meticulously, so that production will surpass each year.

    (II) Dear Chairman Mao:
    In the past, under the rule of the reactionary government, we suffered all kinds of oppression. The land we cultivated was all rented from the landlords. In addition to the high rent and heavy interest we gave to the landlords, we had to send chickens and wine every New Year and holidays. If we were not careful, the landlords would increase the rent and take back the land, leaving us toiling all year round without enough food or clothing!
    Dear Chairman Mao, you led the People's Liberation Army to liberate us from feudal bondage and allow us to stand up. We will never forget the benefits you have given us. Now we are stepping up preparations for land reform so that we can smoothly complete the great cause of liberation -- land reform.

### 解放后的农民  给毛主席的感谢信

　　解放后的农民
    给毛主席的感谢信
    （一）敬爱的毛主席：
    当我们大家欢天喜地庆祝胜利完成土地改革的时候，我们又想到了您。
    以前，我们穷人没田种，受地主的压迫，地租和高利贷把我们压得气都喘不过来。我们在白天给地主做活，自己的活只好放到夜里去作。人没衣食，田没肥料，日子过得太苦了！
    幸亏有了您，我们敬爱的毛主席，我们劳动人民翻过身来了。您领导解放军解放了我们，又领导我们开展生产，度过灾荒；现在又号召我们进行土地改革。我们全乡的农民，按照着您的话，紧紧地团结了起来，中立了富农，消灭了地主阶级的封建剥削。这次我们全乡没收征收的土地有五千一百亩，雇贫中农每人分得三亩土地。分地时并对原耕农民作了适当的照顾。
    以前，脚踏别人地，头顶别人的屋，有苦不敢诉，有泪不敢流。现在变啦，我们都从地狱里挣脱出来了。多少年来我们不懂得什么是“笑”，今天我们都笑啦！
    过去，我们都相信是命里穷；现在不穷啦，这都应该感谢您和共产党。今后我们一定要在您的领导下，更加团结起来，加工施肥，深耕细作，使以后的生产一年超过一年。
                                      江苏嘉定县扬甸乡全体农民上
    （二）亲爱的毛主席：
    我们过去在反动政府统治下受尽了欺压。我们种的田都是从地主手里租来的，我们除了给地主的高租重利外，每逢过年过节还得送鸡送酒，稍不注意，地主就要加租拔田，弄得我们终年劳苦，不得温饱！
    亲爱的毛主席，你领导解放军把我们从封建的束缚中解放出来，使我们翻了身。我们永远忘记不了您给我们的好处。现我们正加紧做土改准备工作，以便顺利完成翻身大事业——土地改革。
