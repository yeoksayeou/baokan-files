　　New Book and Periodical Introduction
  "Soviet Woman" to be Published in Chinese
    "Soviet Woman" is a social-political and literary illustrated bi-monthly journal, jointly edited by the Soviet Anti-Fascist Women's Committee and the Central Committee of the Soviet Trade Unions. Since the establishment of the International Bookstore last year, it has frequently arrived in China and has been particularly welcomed by readers. The journal originally had four versions in Russian, English, French, and German. The fifth issue of 1949 contained an article by Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and Vice-Chairman of the Women's International Democratic Federation, titled "The Great Turnaround," and a Chinese version was printed. Later, many readers in our country requested a formal Chinese version. To meet the widespread demand of Chinese readers and respond to their love for the journal, it has been decided to publish a Chinese version starting with the sixth issue of 1950 (the fifth issue will arrive in Beijing soon). It is reported that the International Bookstore, to favor readers, will offer a 30% discount for annual subscriptions and a 20% discount for half-year subscriptions for those who subscribe before October 20th (the original annual price is 18,000 RMB, half price for half a year).
  "Beijing Worker" Volume 2, Issue 6
    "Beijing Worker" semi-monthly magazine, Volume 2, Issue 6, was published on October 15th. The main contents of this issue: In the Current Affairs Commentary, there are "After Heavily Striking the US Military, the Korean People's Army Voluntarily Withdrew from Seoul; on the Hills and Plains, the Brave Korean Guerrillas are Active Everywhere"; "The Whole Country Warmly Celebrates the First National Day; Premier Zhou Calls for Consolidating and Developing the People's Victory"; "Turning the Barren Desert into a Beautiful Vegetable Garden." In "Everyone Talks," there are mainly "Equal Pay for Equal Work for Men and Women, What Reasons Does the Capitalist Hold?"; "One Incident Gives Us Two Lessons," as well as the opinions of the Women Workers Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions on the above two issues. "Production Front" includes "No One Falling Behind Can Win the Battle," "The Soul of the Power Department - Cao Xianbo," "Hot Water at All Times, Convenient and Inexpensive," "Xiao Zhao's Face is Red Again," and "Three Heroes" (Korean Observations) written by writer Ma Feng.
