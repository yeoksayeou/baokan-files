　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 1st (TASS dispatch): The Security Council held a meeting on September 30th to discuss the Soviet proposal that the Security Council urge the US government to stop the inhuman bombing and strafing of peaceful Korean residents and towns by the US Air Force.

　　Soviet representative Malik said that since the Soviet delegation raised this issue on August 8th, inhumane bombings in violation of international law have continued. Malik, refuting US representative Gross's attempt to defend the atrocities of the US Air Force and to prove that it was the "United Nations Air Force" operating in Korea, pointed out that there is no such thing as a "United Nations Air Force" at all. Malik also pointed out that the representatives of the United States and Britain are using the pretext of "military necessity" to advocate continuing the barbaric bombing of peaceful Korean towns.

　　Indian representative Rau said that although news of the large-scale bombing of Korea has caused great anxiety in India, the Indian representative will vote against the Soviet proposal because the proposal accuses the United States without "investigation".

　　The Security Council held a vote, and the Soviet proposal was rejected. Only the Soviet Union voted in favor, the United States and eight other countries voted against, and Yugoslavia abstained. After the vote, Malik issued a brief statement, in which he solemnly pointed out that the responsibility for such bombing of Korea in violation of international law rests entirely with the United States and some countries in the Security Council that voted to obstruct the adoption of the proposal requiring the United States to stop bombing peaceful Korean residents.

　　The next meeting of the Security Council will be convened by the US representative, who will serve as chairman starting October 1st.

　　安理会九月三十日会议
    苏坚主制止美机滥炸朝鲜
    美利用投票机器否决了苏联提案
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社纽约一日讯：安理会于九月三十日举行会议，讨论苏联建议安理会敦促美国政府停止美国空军惨无人道地轰炸扫射朝鲜和平居民及城镇的提案。
    苏联代表马立克说，从苏联代表团八月八日提出这个问题以来，违反国际法的不人道的轰炸仍在进行。马立克在驳斥美国代表葛罗斯企图为美国空军的暴行辩护和企图证明在朝鲜作战的是“联合国空军”时，指出：根本就不存在什么“联合国空军”。马立克并且指出，美国和英国的代表正在借口“军事上的必要”，主张继续野蛮轰炸朝鲜和平城镇。
    印度代表劳氏说：虽然大规模轰炸朝鲜的消息在印度引起很大焦虑，但印度代表将投票反对苏联的提案，因为这个提案未经“调查”就指责美国。
    安理会举行表决结果，否决了苏联的提案。只有苏联一票赞成，美国和其他八国反对，南斯拉夫弃权。在表决以后，马立克发表简短声明，他郑重指出：违反国际法而对朝鲜施行这样的轰炸的责任，完全落在美国和安理会中的一些国家身上，这些国家曾投票阻挠通过要求美国停止轰炸朝鲜和平居民的提案。
    安理会下次会议将由自十月一日起担任主席的美国代表召集。
