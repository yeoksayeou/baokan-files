　　The Editorial Work of "China Youth"
　　In the editorial work of "China Youth," we deeply feel that whether the publication can connect with reality, connect with the masses, and solve the practical problems existing among the masses is the main issue in running the publication well. We have not done enough in this regard, and only offer some immature opinions based on some experiences:
　　(1) First of all, it is necessary to determine which masses and which aspects of practical problems the publication mainly hopes to solve, because we feel that a publication cannot take care of all the masses and solve all practical problems. It is necessary to determine the target audience of the publication. Taking "China Youth" as an example, there are workers, farmers, students...etc. among the youth, and the cultural level is also high and low. It needs to be determined more clearly. We determine to target young people with a cultural level of junior high school third grade or above, including college and middle school students, revolutionary cadres, and young workers, farmers, teachers, shop assistants, clerks, etc. with the same cultural level. Secondly, it is necessary to determine the publication's policy and task. "China Youth" takes "guiding the work of the Youth League and helping young people study" as its editorial policy, and plays the role of ideological guidance based on the practical problems in young people's work, life, and study.
　　(2) It is necessary to constantly study the problems of the masses and closely connect with the masses: (1) Contact the activists among the masses. "China Youth" has sixty special correspondents, most of whom are propaganda ministers or deputy ministers of the Youth League committees of various provinces and cities, responsible for writing articles regularly, providing information on the work, study, life, and thoughts of young people in their respective regions. There are about two hundred special correspondents, distributed in the main departments of the main regions of the country, most of whom are grassroots cadres of the Youth League, leaders of communication groups, leaders of study groups, chairmen of student unions, editors of blackboard newspapers, etc. Their task is to fill in communication forms every month to reflect the situation, organize readers to read, etc. In addition, there are more than six hundred ordinary correspondents, most of whom are more active readers, writing articles irregularly to reflect various situations, and holding symposiums when necessary to exchange opinions and enhance contact. (2) Contact readers through readers' letters. The editorial department has a reader's letter group, responsible for communicating with readers and answering various questions raised by readers. Some of the readers' letters and answers to questions are published in columns such as "Mailbox," "China Youth Q&A," and "Youth League Q&A," and some are answered individually. Most of the readers' letters are about ideological cultivation, and we also learn about the actual situation of the masses by studying the letters. (3) In addition to selecting and publishing some of the readers' contributions, all unused ones are returned with a reply, and problems are discovered and the situation is understood from the contributions. (4) In addition, we also contact relevant departments and connect with the masses through holding symposiums and other methods. (5) We also feel that studying the practical problems of the masses and understanding the situation cannot be done blindly, but needs to be done in a planned and active way. First of all, we must grasp the basic situation existing among the masses.
　　(3) In terms of the content of the publication, in addition to the fact that all articles should be practical, holding essay contests and problem discussions is helpful for connecting with the masses.
　　(4) "China Youth" is the organ publication of the Central Committee of the Youth League. In the editorial work, it is necessary to study policies, study the various policies and tasks determined by the Central Committee of the Youth League, and understand the intentions of the Central Committee of the Youth League, so that we can better solve the practical problems of the young masses.
　　(5) Based on the above points, formulate an editorial plan:
　　(1) We feel that editorial work needs to have a relatively detailed plan, and it is better for each issue of the publication to have a central theme.
　　(2) When soliciting special articles, organizing the relevant situations and problems related to the solicited articles into materials and providing them to the authors can help the content of the articles be more practical.
　　(3) It is necessary to regularly collect and organize the reflections and opinions of readers as a reference for improving the publication.

### 《中国青年》的编辑工作

　　《中国青年》的编辑工作
    在《中国青年》的编辑工作中，我们深深地感到，刊物是否能联系实际联系群众，解决群众中存在的实际问题，是办好刊物的主要问题。关于这方面，我们做得还很不够，只就一些体验提供一些不成熟的意见：
    （一）首先要确定刊物主要希望解决那些群众的那一方面的实际问题，因为我们感到一个刊物不可能照顾所有的群众，解决所有的实际问题。要确定刊物的读者对象，以《中国青年》而论，青年中有工人、农民、学生……等等，文化水平也有高有低，需要确定得更明确些，我们确定以初中三年级以上文化水平的青年为读者对象，包括大中学生、革命干部，和同等文化水平的青年工人、农民、教员、店员、职员等。其次，要确定刊物的方针任务，《中国青年》以“指导青年团工作，帮助青年学习”为编辑方针，根据青年工作、生活、学习中的实际问题，起思想指导的作用。
    （二）需要经常研究群众中的问题，密切联系群众：（１）联系群众中的积极分子。《中国青年》有特约记者六十人，大都为各省市青年团团委的宣传部长或副部长，负责经常写稿，供给各该区青年的工作、学习、生活、思想各方面的情况材料。有特约通讯员约二百余人，分布在全国各主要地区的主要部门中，大都为青年团基层干部、通讯组长、学习组长、学生会主席、黑板报编辑等，任务是每月填通讯表反映情况，组织读者阅读等。此外，普通的通讯员有六百余人，大都为读者中较为积极者，不定期写稿，反映各种情况，并于必要时召开座谈会交换意见增强联系。（２）通过读者来信联系读者。编辑部设读者来信组，负责与读者通信，解答读者提出的各种问题。读者的来信及问题的答复一部分刊登于《信箱》《中国青年问答》《团的问答》等各栏，一部分个别答复。读者来信以关于思想修养方面的问题为多，我们也从研究来信中了解群众中的实际情况。（３）读者来稿，除一部分选用刊登外，不用的一律复信退回，并从来稿中发现问题，了解情况。（４）此外，还与有关部门取得联系，并通过举办座谈会等方式与群众联系。（５）我们还感到，研究群众中的实际问题，了解情况，不能盲目地做，需要有计划地主动地去做，首先要掌握群众中存在的基本情况。
    （三）在刊物的内容上，除所有文章内容要切合实际外，举办征文、问题讨论等，对于联系群众是有帮助的。
    （四）《中国青年》是青年团中央的机关刊物，在编辑工作中需要学习政策，学习团中央所确定的各种方针任务，了解团中央的意图，这样就可以更好地解决青年群众中的实际问题。
    （五）根据以上各点，拟订编辑计划：
    （１）我们感到编辑工作需要有较周密的计划，每期刊物有一个中心比较好。
    （２）特约稿件时，将与所约稿件有关的情况及问题整理成材料供给作者，可以帮助稿件内容更切合实际。
    （３）要经常搜集整理读者的反映和意见，作为改进刊物的参考。
