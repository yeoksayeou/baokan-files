　　The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Membership Reaches Over Three Million
    Over Four Thousand Seven Hundred Branches Established in Various Regions
    The National Headquarters Has Promoted Many Large-Scale Sino-Soviet Friendship Activities Since Its Establishment One Year Ago
    [Reported by this newspaper] October 5th marks the anniversary of the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association National Headquarters. Over the past year, the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has greatly developed throughout the country. As of today, the association's membership has reached 3,013,861. Across the country, two general branches, 37 provincial and municipal branches, and 17 directly affiliated sub-branches have been established. According to incomplete statistics, there are 4,667 sub-branches.
    When the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association National Headquarters was established last year, it launched several large-scale activities related to Sino-Soviet friendship nationwide. These activities included welcoming the Soviet cultural and scientific workers delegation, commemorating the 32nd anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, celebrating Stalin's 70th birthday, and celebrating the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. These activities laid a preliminary foundation for the association's work.
    At the beginning of this year, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association National Headquarters issued a call to establish regular work, which was met with a response from the association's branches and sub-branches across the country. Over the past year, the National Headquarters and various local branches have published 34 kinds of periodicals, most of which are comprehensive publications generally introducing the Soviet Union and providing business reports. The main ones include the National Headquarters' "Sino-Soviet Friendship," the Northeast's "Introduction to the Soviet Union," the Lushun-Dalian's "Friendship," the Wuhan's "Beneficial Friend," and Shanghai's "Soviet Knowledge." At the same time, more than 70 kinds of single-volume publications introducing the Soviet Union have also been published. The National Headquarters, the Northeast, and other regions have shown many Soviet films and held photo exhibitions. According to statistics, the National Headquarters' film projection team traveled to 25 cities, counties, and Mongolian banners over the past year, screening 591 films to an audience of 1,718,260 people. The mobile photo exhibition team traveled to 24 cities, counties, and Mongolian banners, holding exhibitions for an audience of over 1,407,000 people. According to incomplete statistics, the Northeast Sino-Soviet Friendship Association's film screening work alone, screened 868 films during film evenings, with an audience of 2,299,900 people. In 14 provinces and cities across the country, various branches and sub-branches have independently held 232 photo exhibitions, with an audience of 3,273,940 people.
    In addition, the National Headquarters and various regions frequently hold lectures, seminars, broadcasts, and other activities to promote Sino-Soviet cultural exchange. Since March of this year, in addition to the National Headquarters inviting Soviet experts to lecture in our country, local friendship associations have also held various thematic lectures and seminars on Sino-Soviet friendship and learning from the Soviet Union. According to statistics from ten cities, including Shanghai and Beijing, 185 lectures and seminars have been held, with a total attendance of 315,300 people. Beijing, Zhengzhou, Qingdao, Qinhuangdao, and various parts of Hebei have also established "Sino-Soviet Friendship" or "Introduction to the Soviet Union" broadcasts. In addition, various forms of activities, such as slides, peep shows, rooftop broadcasts, cultural sheds, Yangge dances, short plays, and drum lyrics, have been used to strengthen the people's understanding of the Soviet Union and enhance the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. In terms of amateur Russian language education, according to incomplete statistics, more than 28 regions across the country have established Russian language night schools or Russian language tutoring classes. The Russian language night school organized by the National Headquarters in Beijing has enrolled two terms, with 540 students currently. The Northeast General Branch and the Beijing, Shanxi, Zhejiang and other branches have also established Russian language broadcasts, with a peak audience of over 24,000 people.
    In order to introduce China's situation to foreign countries, the National Headquarters has presented the Soviet Union's Foreign Cultural Association with 34 kinds of New China records, totaling 64 discs, over the past year. In addition, a total of 2,174 books, magazines, and pictorials have been presented to the Soviet Union, various people's democratic countries, and some capitalist countries' friendship associations with the Soviet Union and other people's organizations.
