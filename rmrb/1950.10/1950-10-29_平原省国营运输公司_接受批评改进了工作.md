Editor's Note: On August 26th, the "People's Garden" published Comrade Zhao Chunyi's criticism of the Pingyuan Province Transportation Company. The company leadership repeatedly held meetings to review the situation, and finally unanimously submitted to the truth and accepted the criticism. As a result, the company's work has improved. At the same time, the critic, Comrade Zhao Chunyi, also conducted a self-criticism of one or two inaccuracies in the criticism. Both sides have a clearer understanding of the significance and role of criticism and self-criticism. We are now publishing the Pingyuan Transportation Company's review, letters from Comrade Zhao Chunyi, and Comrade Wang Zhixin of the Pingyuan Daily.

Pingyuan Province State-Owned Transportation Company's Review
To the Editors:

After the "People's Garden" published Comrade Zhao Chunyi's letter of criticism, "Communist Party Members Who Violate Laws and Disciplines Must Also Be Sanctioned by Laws and Disciplines" on August 26th, the leading cadres of the company's administration and Party organization convened branch meetings for Party rectification and cadre consolidation to conduct research. Subsequently, the superior Party instructed the branch leading comrades to carefully examine the matter, clarify the facts, and improve Party-people relations. We are now informing you of our inspection results.

The embezzlement by Guo Changhe, Ren Weifu, and Li Shouyan, and the loss of beads by Wei Quanxing, were the result of our bureaucratic leadership. Usually, we did a very poor job of educating employees, which led to the continuous occurrence of events that harmed the interests of the people. At the same time, due to our lack of experience in managing enterprises, unscientific division of labor, and unsound institutions, we were busy with administrative work all day long. Therefore, the problems of the above-mentioned comrades were not dealt with in a timely manner, and were delayed for half a year. Guo Changhe's problem was only discussed at the salary evaluation meeting, and no general meeting was held to announce his punishment, which caused misunderstandings among the comrades. This shows that our Party and government leaders have a careless work style.

The Party-people relationship is not close enough, and the old and new cadres are not united enough. Since the company's Party organization was made public, the Party members have indeed made progress under the supervision of the masses, but due to the lack of strict branch life and insufficient education for Party members, individual Party members have not yet corrected their shortcomings. In this Party rectification study, the Party has reviewed the Party-people relationship. Comrade Zhao Chunyi's letter of criticism is helpful to us. In the future, we are determined to improve the Party-people relationship.

We believe that Comrade Guo Changhe's embezzlement is serious. After the branch discovered his mistake, he was criticized and, with the approval of the superior Party, was given a punishment of one year of probation within the Party. At the same time, the administration convened two employee meetings to criticize his mistakes, removed him from his position as stationmaster, reduced his salary, and recovered the embezzled funds. The problems of Comrades Ren Weifu, Li Shouyan, and Wei Quanxing have been discussed several times, and have been approved by the superior level, each given a demerit recorded in their files as a warning, and to educate all employees. The statement that non-Party comrades need not ask about the mistakes committed by Party members was said by Comrade Fang Yunzhu at the salary evaluation meeting. We believe that this statement is incorrect, and we will correct this shortcoming in the future.

After the "People's Garden" published Comrade Zhao Chunyi's letter of criticism, we wrote a reply. In order to be cautious, the newspaper comrades sent the company's reply to Comrade Zhao Chunyi for his opinion; Comrade Zhao pointed out that our reply contained inaccuracies, so we held another symposium to study together and concluded that the first reply did contain inaccuracies. Therefore, we wrote this reply.

Pingyuan Province State-Owned Transportation Company

Comrade Zhao Chunyi's Letter
To the Editors:

After you published my letter criticizing the Pingyuan Province Motor Transport Company on August 26th, some comrades said to me that the content of this article you wrote is true, but this approach is not popular, and don't do it again in the future. Some comrades said that I had gone crazy. At this time, I thought to myself: If I accept the opinions of some comrades, this is irresponsible to the revolution. After a week of ideological struggle, I finally stuck to my original position. If the company fires me, I can go home and produce and I won't starve. However, I was still daydreaming all day long, and I was extremely depressed ideologically. One day, I went to the Pingyuan Daily to talk to Comrade Wang Zhixin about this issue. Comrade Wang said that my criticism was correct, and he read to me the Party Central Committee's decision on launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and publications, so that I could work with peace of mind and not have any concerns. In early September, I received a letter from my brother from Xi'an, encouraging me, saying that as long as my criticism is based on facts and not exaggerated, it is correct. So my emotions gradually calmed down. When I thought again of the Party newspaper constantly criticizing incidents of suppressing criticism and retaliating against critics, my concerns were eliminated.

On September 18th, the company held a symposium. At the meeting, the Party and administrative leading comrades expressed their welcome and gratitude for the spirit in which I wrote the manuscript. This is unprecedented in our country's history, and can only be done in a country under the leadership of the Communist Party. At the meeting, I also made a self-criticism. What I said in my original letter, "Guo Changhe has not received the punishment he deserves," is not consistent with the facts. In fact, the leadership has already dealt with it, but it has not been announced to the masses. As for saying that sending Ren Weifu and others to the Public Security Bureau and the court, "it was put on hold due to Party rectification study," is also incorrect. This is the result of mere speculation.

After the Pingyuan Daily published criticism of the Pingyuan Transportation Company's driving aspects on August 13th, and the People's Daily published a letter criticizing the Pingyuan Transportation Company's poor Party-people relations on August 26th, the leading comrades attached great importance to it and dealt with it seriously. According to employees, the company's leadership style has recently improved. This is a good phenomenon, and I hope to continue to implement it.

Zhao Chunyi

Pingyuan Daily's Wang Zhixin's Letter
To the Editors:

After the "People's Garden" published Comrade Zhao Chunyi's criticism of the Pingyuan Province State-Owned Transportation Company on August 26th, the company held a symposium on September 18th. Participants included 13 people from the Provincial Government Transportation Department, the Company Union, Pingyuan Daily reporters, and Comrade Zhao Chunyi.

In the four-hour meeting, the first two-plus hours were spent on questioning the ideological motives of the contributor and going around in circles on minor issues. Although they verbally accepted Comrade Zhao Chunyi's criticism, they did not do so when it came to specific issues. At the time, I felt that this not only deviated from the center of the topic, but also damaged the criticism. I immediately raised my opinion to the host of the meeting, hoping to correct this deviation. After consideration, they finally accepted my suggestion.

That afternoon, Party Branch Secretary Lü Xueren, on behalf of the company, made a preliminary review at the meeting: recognizing that there was indeed serious bureaucracy in the company's leadership, and pointed out that Comrade Zhao Chunyi's criticism was basically correct. Comrade Zhao Chunyi also consciously reviewed his own shortcomings.

Now, according to our understanding, the company's leadership style has undergone some changes: a new work system has been established, such as designating every Wednesday as Transportation Safety Education Day, organizing drivers, assistants, and workers to conduct business studies of driving regulations. The division of labor and responsibility system has also become clearer. The phenomenon of leaders being in a state of chaos has also undergone some changes.

Comrade Zhao Chunyi's concerns have been dispelled. He has a further understanding of criticism. Deputy Manager Lu Jiayun's attempt to use his authority to replace Comrade Zhao Chunyi's work has also been corrected.

　　平原省国营运输公司
    接受批评改进了工作
    编者按：八月二十六日人民园地发表了赵纯一同志对平原省运输公司的批评。该公司领导上一再开会检讨，最后一致服从真理，接受批评，公司工作因此有了改进。同时批评者赵纯一同志，对批评中一二不符事实处也进行了自我检讨。双方对批评和自我批评的意义和作用都有了更明确的认识。兹将平原运输公司的检讨、赵纯一同志及平原日报汪志新同志的来信一并发表。
    平原省国营运输公司的检讨编辑同志：
    八月二十六日人民园地发表了赵纯一同志的“共产党员违犯法纪同样得受法纪制裁”批评信以后，公司行政与党组织的领导干部即召开了整党整干支分会会议，进行了研究。接着，上级党指示支部领导同志要很好检查此事，弄清是非，以改善党群关系。现将我们的检查结果告诉你们。
    郭长和、任为富、李寿延的贪污，魏全兴的丢失珠子等事件，是我们官僚主义领导的结果。平时，我们对职工的教育做得很差，致使损害人民利益的事件不断发生。同时，由于我们缺乏管理企业的经验，分工不科学，机构不健全，整日忙于事务工作。因此，对上述几个同志的问题，没有及时处理，竟拖了半年之久。郭长和的问题，也仅在评薪会上谈了一下，并未召开大会，宣布对他的处分，遂使同志们发生了误会。这说明我们党政领导同志有着粗枝大叶的工作作风。
    党群关系是不够密切的，新老干部也不够团结。公司党的组织自公开以后，党员在群众监督下，的确有了进步，但由于支部生活不严格，对党员的教育不够，个别党员仍未纠正其缺点。我们在这次整党学习中，党内曾检查了党群关系。赵纯一同志的批评信，对我们是有帮助的。今后，我们下决心将党群关系搞好。
    我们认为郭长和同志的贪污是严重的。在支部发现他的错误以后，曾对他进行了批评，并经上级党批准，给予留党察看一年的处分。同时行政上曾召开了两次职工大会，对他的错误进行了斗争，并撤去其站长职务，降低薪金待遇，追偿了贪污款项。任为富、李寿延、魏全兴三同志的问题，经过数次讨论，已由上级批准，各予记大过一次处分，以示警戒，并教育全体职工。关于党员犯了错误，非党同志不必过问一语，系方云助同志在评薪会上说的。我们认为这种说法是不对的，今后我们要纠正这个缺点。
    当人民园地发表赵纯一同志的批评信以后，我们曾写过一次答复。报社同志为了郑重起见，曾将公司的答复寄给赵纯一同志，请他提供意见；赵同志即指出了我们的答复有与事实不符之处，于是我们又召开了一次座谈会，共同研究，认为第一次的答复中确有不符合事实的地方。因此，我们又写了这个答复。
                                          平原省国营运输公司
    赵纯一同志来信编辑同志：
    八月二十六日你们发表了我批评平原省汽车运输公司的信以后，有些同志对我说，你这次写的稿件，内容是真实的，可是这种作法是吃不开的，今后可不要这样了。有的同志说我得了神经病。此时，我心里想：要是接受某些同志们的意见，这是对革命不负责任。经过一星期的思想斗争后，我终于坚持了原来的主张。假如公司解雇我的话，就回家生产也饿不着。可是，我还是成天地胡思乱想，思想上极为苦闷。一天，我到平原日报找汪志新同志谈了谈这个问题，汪同志说我批评是对的，并把党中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定给我读了一遍，让我安心工作，不要存有任何顾虑。九月上旬，我接到哥哥由西安来信，鼓励我，说只要我的批评是实事求是，不是加油加醋，就是对的。于是我的情绪渐渐平静下来了。当我又想到党报不断批评压制批评、报复批评者的事件时，我的顾虑就扫除了。
    九月十八日公司召开了座谈会。会上，党和行政领导同志对我写稿的精神，都表示欢迎与感谢。这在我国的历史上是空前未有的事，只有在共产党领导下的国家才能作到这一点。会上，我也作了自我检查。我原信内所说“郭长和并未受到应得的处分”一语，是与事实不符的。实际上，领导上已作了处理，只是未向群众公布而已。至于说将任为富等三人送公安局送法院事，“因整党学习而搁下了”一语，也是不对的。这是单凭臆测的结果。
    八月十三日平原日报发表了对平原运输公司行车方面的批评，二十六日人民日报又发表了批评平原运输公司党群关系不好的信件以后，领导同志都很重视，并作了认真的处理。据职工反映说，公司的领导作风最近已有了改进。这是一个好现象，希望继续贯彻下去。
                              赵纯一
    平原日报汪志新来信编辑同志：
    人民园地于八月二十六日发表了赵纯一同志对平原省国营运输公司的批评以后，该公司曾于九月十八日召开了一次座谈会。参加者有省府交通厅、公司工会、平原日报记者及赵纯一同志等共十三人。
    在四个钟头的会议里，最初两个多钟头用在质询投稿人的思想动机上面，并在枝节问题上绕圈子。他们虽然在口头上接受赵纯一同志的批评，但涉及到具体问题时，却又不然了。当时，我感到这不但离开了议题的中心，并且是对批评的损害。我当即向会议的主持人提出了意见，希望纠正这个偏向。他们经考虑后，终于接受了我的建议。
    当日下午，党支书吕学仁同志代表公司在会上作了初步的检讨：认识到公司领导上确是存在着严重的官僚主义，并指出赵纯一同志的批评基本上是正确的。赵纯一同志也自觉地检讨了自己的缺点。
    现在，据我们了解，该公司领导作风有了某些转变：已建立了新的工作制度，如将每星期三作为运输安全教育日，组织司机、助手、工人等进行行车规章的业务学习。分工负责制也更加明确起来了。领导同志的忙乱现象，已有了某些转变。
    赵纯一同志的顾虑消除了。他对批评有了进一步的认识。副经理陆甲云企图利用职权撤换赵纯一同志的工作的行为，也已得到纠正。
                                          平原日报社  汪志新
