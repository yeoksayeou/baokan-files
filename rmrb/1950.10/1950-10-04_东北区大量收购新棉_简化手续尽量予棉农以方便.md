Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 26th. New cotton in the cotton-producing areas of Northeast China has been successively launched on the market in early September, and the Northeast Region Company of the China National Cotton Yarn & Cloth Corporation has begun active purchasing.

This year, the cotton planting area in Northeast China has doubled compared to last year. Due to even rainfall and meticulous cultivation by cotton farmers, cotton has generally matured half a month earlier, and the quality is good and the quantity is high. In addition to instructing its subordinate branches to vigorously purchase cotton, the Northeast Region Cotton Yarn & Cloth Company has entrusted more than 60% of the purchase tasks to district and village cooperatives. At the same time, purchase contracts have been signed with private merchants who are willing to purchase on behalf of the company. During the purchase process, local branches collect cotton as it arrives, simplify procedures, and provide convenience to cotton farmers as much as possible. The company and cooperatives will collect cotton on behalf of farmers who are willing to use cotton to pay public grain or repay cotton loans. At present, cotton farmers in various places are very enthusiastic about selling new cotton. Gaiping County, one of the main cotton-producing areas in Liaodong Province, purchases nearly 100,000 jin of new cotton every day. The temporary cotton collection station set up by the Huai’de County Cooperative in Dayangzicheng, Jilin Province, had taken in more than 60,000 jin of new cotton as of around the 10th.

This year, under the government's policy of rewarding cotton planting and improving cotton quality, the price of cotton in Northeast China is based on the central government's instructions on the cotton-grain price ratio. Ginned cotton is divided into five grades and eight levels, with the highest price being equivalent to 23 jin of sorghum per jin, and the lowest being equivalent to 9 jin of sorghum; seed cotton is divided into five grades, with the highest equivalent to 8 jin of sorghum, and the lowest equivalent to 3 jin of sorghum. Purchasing units in various places are equipped with cotton standards issued by the regional company for cotton farmers to refer to and compare. In addition, 400 trained cotton quality identification technicians are equipped to ensure that the grading and pricing are fair and reasonable. In order to guarantee the supply of raw materials for the textile industry, the Northeast Region Cotton Yarn & Cloth Company has built new cotton ginning factories and added 490 cotton ginning machines.

　　东北区大量收购新棉
    简化手续尽量予棉农以方便
    【新华社沈阳二十六日电】东北各棉产区新棉已于九月上旬相继上市，中国花纱布公司东北区公司已开始积极收购。
    今年东北植棉面积较去年增多一倍。由于雨量调匀，棉农精耕细作，棉花普遍早熟半月，而且质好量多。东北区花纱布公司除指示所属分支公司大力收购外，并将百分之六十以上的收购任务委托区村合作社。同时并与愿意代为收购的私商签订收购合同。各地分支公司在收购中，随到随收，简化手续，尽量予棉农以方便。凡棉农愿以棉花交公粮或归还棉花贷款的，公司及合作社均予代收。目前各地棉农出卖新棉极为踊跃。辽东省主要产棉区之一的盖平县，每日收购新棉近十万斤。吉林省怀德县合作社在大杨子城所设的临时收棉站，截至十日左右，已收进新棉六万多斤。
    今年东北棉的价，在政府奖励植棉提高棉质的政策下，按中央人民政府棉粮比价的指示，皮棉分为五等八级，最高价格每斤合高粱二十三斤，最低合高粱九斤；籽棉分为五等，最高合高粱八斤，最低合高粱三斤。各地收购单位都备有区公司发给的棉花标准，供棉农参考比较，另外并配备有受过训练的四百名鉴别棉质的技术人员，使评等作价公平合理。东北区花纱布公司为保证纺织工业原料的供应，已修建了新的轧花厂，并添置了四百九十台轧花机。
