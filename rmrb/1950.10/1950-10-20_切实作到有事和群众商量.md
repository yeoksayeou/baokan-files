　　Earnestly Practice Discussing Matters with the Masses

　　Many good deeds are ruined in the hands of some people. Why is this? This is mainly because they have forgotten the fundamental principle that Chairman Mao teaches us every day: "Discuss matters with the masses."

　　The incident of Jiyuan County cutting "jia mu" (framework timber) for disaster relief is an example of a "good deed" that was ruined. It was correct for the Jiyuan County Committee to think of leading the masses in production for disaster relief during a period of severe disaster; this is what every Communist Party member and every leading body should do. However, they forgot the fundamental principle of discussing matters with the masses. They did not understand that such a major matter concerning the vital interests of the broad masses should be fully discussed with the masses, leading the masses in a thorough discussion to find production avenues that everyone is willing and able to pursue, and guiding the masses to act consciously. The Jiyuan County Committee did not consult with the masses, did not understand the demands of the masses and the conditions of the mountains and forests, and blindly believed that "there is no way to engage in production for disaster relief without cutting jia mu," thinking that "the method I thought of is the best." This is a form of complacency. Therefore, they deviated from reality, deviated from the masses, and subjectively signed a contract for cutting jia mu. The felling plan made after the contract was also subjective and unrealistic. Moreover, the leadership was consistently unwilling to adopt the opinions of the masses, and when encountering practical difficulties, they still wanted to proceed, "unwilling to give up until the goal was achieved." After being criticized by the Commissioner's Office and the newspaper, they were afraid of "losing face if they didn't complete the task" and "losing their own credibility," so they issued an order: "Complete the task in one month, not a single jia mu less, not a single day more. If it is not completed, the district head and the district secretary will be held responsible." District cadres also forced the masses to go up the mountains to cut jia mu under the slogan of "half for disaster relief, half for the task." As a result, it caused a serious chaotic phenomenon of indiscriminate felling, wasteful eating and drinking, seriously violating the policies of the Party and the People's Government, seriously harming the interests of the masses and the interests of the state, and undermining the unity of the people on and off the mountains.

　　At the Third Party Congress of Pingyuan Province, the Jiyuan County Committee exposed this bureaucracy, and the Commissioner's Office and the newspaper also made self-criticisms. This was necessary, but it is also necessary to further understand that the main reason for the creation of such serious consequences was "complacency and arrogance," and the unwillingness to discuss matters with the masses. This lesson should be deeply remembered, and in future work, we must genuinely and humbly, rather than verbally, accept the opinions of the masses and discuss matters with the masses.

### 切实作到有事和群众商量

　　切实作到有事和群众商量
    有许多好事，到某些人手里就被办坏了。为什么呢？这主要是因为他们忘记了毛主席天天教导我们的“有事要和群众商量”的一条基本原则。
    济源县砍架木救灾的这件事，就是一件被人办坏了的“好事”。济源县委在灾情相当严重的时候，能够想到领导群众生产救灾，这是对的，这是每个共产党员和每个领导机关应当作的事情。但是由于他们忘记了有事和群众商量的基本原则。他们不了解这样关系广大群众切身利益的大事，应当充分地和群众商量，领导群众加以充分的讨论，找出大家愿办而又能办到的生产门路，引导群众自觉地行动起来。济源县委不去和群众商量，不去了解群众的要求和山林的情况，盲目地认为“不砍架木就没有办法生产救灾”，以为只有“我想的办法最好”，这是一种自满情绪。因此，他们脱离实际，脱离群众，主观地签订了砍架木的合同。订了合同以后，作出的砍伐架木计划，也是主观的和不切合实际的。而且领导上始终不愿采纳群众意见，遇到实际困难，仍然要干下去，“不达目的不甘心”。受到专署与报社批评之后，又害怕“完不成任务自己丢人”、“失了自己信用”，于是下一道命令：“一月完成任务，架木不许少一根，时间不许多一天，完不成要由区长区书负责。”区干部也在“一半为救灾，一半为任务”的口号下，强迫群众上山砍架木。结果就造成了严重的乱砍乱伐乱吃乱喝的混乱现象，严重地违犯了党和人民政府的政策，严重地损害了群众利益和国家利益，破坏了山上和山下群众的团结。
    在平原省第三次党代表大会上，济源县委揭发了这种官僚主义，专署、报社也做了检查，这是必要的，但是还应该进一步了解，这样严重的恶果的造成，主要是因为“自满自负”，有事不愿和群众商量。应该深刻记住这个教训，在今后的工作中，要实际的虚心而不是口头的虚心接受群众意见，有事和群众商量。
