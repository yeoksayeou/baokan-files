　　Work Hard, Work Hard! We Are Now Working For Ourselves!
    Ji Guanqing, Industrial Labor Model of the Central and Southern China Region

　　It’s definitely happening that I will be spending this year's National Day in Beijing, which is truly a joyous and glorious event! I was selected as an industrial representative to attend the National Labor Model Representative Conference. I came to Beijing for the meeting, saw our Chairman Mao, and can celebrate National Day with Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the heads of the Central Government. This is something I never dreamed of in my life.

　　When I was an apprentice in the old society, I was beaten and kicked by the shopkeeper. At that time, I could only swallow my anger and keep it in my stomach, just hoping to learn some skills so I wouldn't starve for the rest of my life. Back then, I couldn't eat enough or wear warm clothes, and I slept in broken-down cars parked on the side of the road at night. Especially in winter, I would freeze in the driver's seat, unable to sleep all night, and my hands and feet would get sores, but I still had to work during the day. When eating, the shopkeeper always complained that I ate too much, and when working, he always complained that I worked too little. I served the master craftsmen like my own parents, making their beds and folding their quilts, but I still couldn't learn any skills. In those four or five years of bitter days, the suffering I endured was endless. Who knew that even if you learned a skill, under the old social system, having skills meant nothing if you didn't have connections. Working in the factory wasn't about skill, it was about relationships, connections, giving gifts, flattery, and other tricks to keep your job. Relying solely on a fixed salary, with skyrocketing prices, was impossible to survive. What could I do? I wouldn't steal or rob, I couldn't flatter or boast, and I certainly wouldn't dare to embezzle. At that time, I could only blame my bad luck, as if it were predetermined from a previous life.

　　In 1947, I was working in Xuchang when it was first liberated. At that time, I was suffering from severe dysentery. In the repair shop of the relief sub-bureau, I had no money for treatment. Fortunately, Xuchang was liberated, and the People's Liberation Army cured my illness in their military camp. At that time, I was very weak, and because the People's Liberation Army was moving so quickly, I couldn't participate in the work. So, the People's Liberation Army gave me travel expenses and sent me back to Kaifeng. From that time on, I had a preliminary understanding of the people's army. Later, Kaifeng and Zhengzhou were liberated one after another, and I quickly joined the revolutionary camp. With the continuous help of the Party and the Youth League, I became aware that workers could only have a better life under the leadership of the Communist Party, that the Communist Party was the party of the workers and working masses, and that workers could seize political power. After liberation, workers were elevated to the position of masters of the country.

　　Work hard, work hard! We are now working for ourselves, and our lives are already guaranteed.

　　At that time, some people said that Old Li's thinking had really changed. I had a flaw at that time, which was that I was moving too fast. Later, I buried myself in hard work, and the masses also made progress day by day, and they developed a good impression of me. We worked together to improve production.

　　This time, everyone elected me as a labor model to attend the National Labor Model Representative Conference. This is thanks to the leadership of our Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and also the result of everyone's joint efforts. Glory belongs to Chairman Mao! This glory should also belong to everyone. I can only learn more humbly from the broad masses of the people in the future, closely connect with the masses, and work together to build our new China and strive to improve our lives to the end!

　　干吧，干吧！我们现在是给自己做工了！
    中南区工业劳动模范  季冠清
    今年的国庆日肯定的在北京过了，这真是喜上加喜的光荣大事！我当选为出席全国劳模代表会议的工业代表，来北京开会，看到了咱们的毛主席，又可以同毛主席、朱总司令及中央政府各首长在一块参加庆祝国庆，这真是我有生以来作梦也想不到的事。
    我以前在旧社会里当学徒时，受掌柜的打骂脚踢，那时只有忍着气压在肚子里，只是眼巴巴的望着学会一些技术，好一辈子饿不死。那时，吃不饱，穿不暖，夜间睡在马路边停着的坏汽车上。尤其是冬天，冻僵在汽车上的驾驶室内，一夜睡不着，手脚都烂了，还得白天干活。吃饭时，掌柜的光嫌吃得多，作活光嫌作得少。给老师傅们铺床折被，侍奉着如亲老子，还学不到技术。四五年的苦岁月里，受的痛苦是说不完的。谁知道学会了技术，到工厂里作工，在旧社会的制度下，有技术的人，没有面子也吃不开。厂内作工不是靠技术，是靠人情、面子、送礼、拍马等等花样来投机取巧，求得保持住个人饭碗。光依靠着死薪金，在物价暴涨的情况下，还是维持不住。怎样办呢？偷人抢人咱不会，拍马吹牛，嘴不会说，揩油舞弊更不敢作。那时只怪自己命运不好，是前生注定了。
    一九四七年，我在许昌作工，正赶上许昌第一次解放。那时我正害着很重的痢疾病。在救济分署修配厂内，没有钱看病。赶巧许昌被解放了，在解放军的军营中，把我的病治好了。当时我身体很弱，在解放军流动得很快的生活中，我不能参加工作，解放军便给我路费，送我回开封。从那时，我对人民的军队有了初步的认识。后来开封、郑州相继解放，我便很快的参加到革命阵营里工作。在党、团对我不断的帮助下，我觉悟了，知道工人只有在共产党领导下，生活才能好起来，共产党就是工人劳动群众的政党，工人可以掌握政权。解放后，工人提高到国家主人翁的地位。
    干吧，干吧！我们现在是给我们自己做工了，我们的生活已经有保障了。
    那时有人说，老李的思想真有些变样了。我当时有一个缺点，是有些跑的太快了。后来我在工作中埋头苦干，群众也一天天进步了，对我起了好感。我们在一块，共同努力搞好生产。
    这一次大家把我评选成劳模，出席全国劳模代表会议。这是我们共产党毛主席领导的功绩，也是大家共同努力的结果，光荣属于毛主席！这个光荣，也应当是大家的。我只有在以后更虚心的向广大人民学习，密切联系群众，共同努力，为建设我们的新中国，为改善我们的生活而奋斗到底！
