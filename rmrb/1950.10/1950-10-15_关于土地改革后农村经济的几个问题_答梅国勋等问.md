　　Several Questions Concerning Rural Economy After Land Reform
    Answers to Questions from Mei Guoxun and Others

    I. Are there still landlord classes, landlords, poor peasants, and class struggles in areas after land reform?

    Question: There are a few questions we don't understand while studying land reform documents. Our questions are: Does land reform mean the elimination of the landlord class? If so, why are former landlords still called landlords after land reform? Are there still class struggles in these areas? Are there still poor peasants and farm laborers in the countryside after land reform? We hope you can answer these questions.
    Mei Guoxun

    Answer: After land reform, the feudal landlord class, as feudal and semi-feudal exploiters, has been overthrown. However, the status of the landlords themselves will still exist for a certain period. Because it takes five years of labor reform for landlords to become working people. At the same time, small landowners who rent out land are also allowed to exist, but their exploitation is extremely limited and cannot play a significant role in the overall rural economy, which is very different from the landlord exploitation before land reform. After land reform, as a whole class, there is no longer a conflict between the peasant class and the landlord class in the countryside. However, the landlord class's resistance to and sabotage of land reform, as well as their counterattacks against the peasants, will be very fierce, and this struggle cannot be ended all at once. As for the ideological struggle, it will continue for a certain period. And this fierce struggle sometimes manifests itself concretely in various forms. At the same time, due to the existence of the rich peasant economy, the class struggle between rich peasants and farm laborers still exists. However, under the new democratic regime, the struggle between rich peasants and farm laborers can be appropriately resolved under the premise of developing production and according to the principle of benefiting both labor and capital.

    In addition, there will still be poor peasants and farm laborers for a considerable period after land reform. First of all, the status of the emancipated poor peasants and farm laborers is not easy to change within a certain period. Secondly, new poor peasants and farm laborers may still emerge after land reform. Because some peasants, due to relatively unfavorable living conditions, or lack of effort in production, or poor management, or encountering certain irresistible setbacks, their economy cannot develop and gradually becomes impoverished, and some of them will inevitably be exploited and become new poor peasants or farm laborers. This situation is difficult to avoid even in a new democratic society, and it is allowed and not to be feared, because this situation cannot change the basic form and development prospects of the new democratic rural economy. Thirdly, in the case of preserving the rich peasant economy, some areas will have the phenomenon that the land requirements of poor peasants and farm laborers cannot be fully met; although the state can use loans and other methods to help farmers, some poor peasants and farm laborers in rural areas will still exist for a certain period.

    II. After the completion of land reform, will there still be a situation of land concentration and farmers losing their land again?

    Question: Article 30 of the Land Reform Law stipulates that after the completion of land reform, the People's Government recognizes the right of all landowners to freely manage, buy, sell, and rent their land. I would like to ask: Will this lead to land concentration again and cause many farmers to lose their land?

    Answer: Generally speaking, before the abolition of private land ownership, the phenomenon of changes in land ownership is always possible. The current stage of land reform in China only confiscates the private land of feudal landlords and does not confiscate the private land of peasants. The land confiscated from landlords is generally distributed to peasants with no land or little land (except in the suburbs of Beijing). Then, some farmers will sell or rent out their land due to natural disasters, man-made disasters, poor management, relocation, or career changes that they cannot resist at present. In addition, some farmers will also lease or purchase land due to population growth, increased labor force, or good management and surpluses. Some capitalists will also invest in purchasing or leasing land when it is profitable to engage in agricultural production.

    However, changes in land ownership after land reform are limited and cannot lead to large-scale land concentration. The reason is that the leadership of land reform is not the bourgeois regime, but the people's democratic dictatorship regime under the leadership of the proletariat. On the one hand, in order to eliminate the landlords' heavy exploitation of the peasants and increase the peasants' enthusiasm for production, this regime implements the land reform policy of confiscating the landlords' land and distributing it to the peasants; on the other hand, after land reform, it further organizes and leads the peasants to implement cooperation and mutual assistance, and the state provides strong support in terms of loans and fertilizers, seeds, farm tools, and pesticides, and at the same time implements a reasonable burden policy, so that farmers generally do not have to accept usury or other forms of exploitation and lose their land again due to difficulties in production, as they did in the past. The government will also carry out possible relief and prevention for natural disasters such as floods and droughts, so as to reduce the scope and severity of the damage. The state will gradually adjust taxes and prices to make them more reasonable, so that farmers will not have to bear unreasonable and heavy taxes as they did under the rule of landlords and the bourgeoisie. In this way, the most important reasons that force farmers to lose their land and go bankrupt are eliminated, and large-scale land concentration of feudal or capitalist nature becomes impossible. Please see the general rise in the living standards of farmers in the liberated areas of Northeast China and North China after land reform, and you will understand.

    Naturally, the situation of land fragmentation after land reform will also change after a considerable period. Under the leadership and education of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the vast number of peasants will inevitably recognize through practical production experience that this fragmented system of private land ownership is not the best system. The reason is that scattered farmers are unable to fully apply fertilizers, nor can they make extensive use of advanced machinery and equipment, so that the improvement of agricultural productivity and the improvement of farmers' lives have their limitations. Only by taking the road of agricultural collectivization, like the collective farms in the Soviet Union, can we open up infinitely broad prospects for the development of productivity and the improvement of farmers' lives. At that time, the land will also be concentrated, but that is essentially different from the land concentration in feudal and capitalist societies. The latter is concentrated in the hands of a few landlords on the basis of private land ownership, while the former is based on public land ownership, and farmers use collective methods to engage in large-scale agricultural production. This is the long-term vision of agricultural production in New China.

    III. Questions Concerning the Confiscation of Land of Temples and Churches in Rural Areas and Others

    Question: What churches and temples are included in the confiscation of land of temples and churches in rural areas as stipulated in the Land Reform Law?
        Zhang Jiwu

    Answer: According to the provisions of the Land Reform Law, in general areas, the confiscation of land of temples and churches in rural areas includes all temples and churches. Only "the land owned by mosques may be appropriately retained with the consent of the local Muslims." That is to say, when dealing with the land issue of mosques, the opinions of local Muslims should be solicited; if local Muslims agree to retain the land of mosques, it may be appropriately retained and not distributed. As for minority areas, different considerations should be given.

    Question: In land reform, when confiscating and distributing the surplus houses of landlords in rural areas, should the furniture in the houses be confiscated and distributed intact? If so, how should we deal with the situation where the amount and quality of furniture in each room vary greatly?
        He Yinchu

    Answer: The furniture in the houses should be confiscated and distributed along with the houses, but reasonable adjustments can be made to each other for the convenience of use.

    Question: Why does Article 4 of the Land Reform Law stipulate that "the industry and commerce兼营operated by landlords and the land and property directly used for operating industry and commerce shall not be confiscated"? What does "land and property directly used for operating industry and commerce" refer to? For example, are the cotton fields of landlords兼营operating纱factories and the wheat fields of landlords兼营operating面粉factories belong to this category?

    Answer: According to Article 14 of Item B of the Decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on the Division of Rural Class Components, "Its (referring to the landlord - editor) industry and commerce and factory buildings, shops, houses, and property connected to industry and commerce shall not be confiscated." Obviously, the "land" directly used for operating industry and commerce referred to in Article 4 of the Land Reform Law refers to the land occupied by factory buildings, shops, houses, etc. mentioned in the document issued by the Government Administration Council on class classification. The cotton fields of landlords兼营operating纱factories and the wheat fields of landlords兼营operating面粉factories you mentioned are tools for landlords to carry out feudal exploitation and do not belong to the scope of "land directly used for operating industry and commerce." Of course, they are not included in the list of "not to be confiscated" and should be on the list of "to be confiscated."

### 关于土地改革后农村经济的几个问题  答梅国勋等问

　　关于土地改革后农村经济的几个问题
    答梅国勋等问
    一、土地改革后的地区是否还有地主阶级、地主、贫雇农以及阶级斗争？
    问：我们在学习土地改革文件中，有几个问题不明白。我们的问题是：土地改革后是不是就算消灭了地主阶级？如果说是的，为什么在土地改革前的地主，土地改革后仍叫地主？那么在这些地区是否还有阶级斗争？土地改革后的农村，是否还有贫雇农存在？以上问题希予解答。
    梅国勋
    答：土地改革之后，作为封建与半封建剥削者的封建地主阶级是被打倒了。但，地主本人的成份在一定时间内还是存在的。因为由地主变成劳动人民，需要经过五年的劳动改造。同时小土地出租者也是允许存在的，但这种人的剥削是极有限度的，在整个农村经济中不可能起大作用，与土地改革前的地主剥削大不相同。土地改革之后，作为整个阶级来说，在农村中，已没有农民阶级对地主阶级的对立了，但是地主阶级对土地改革的抵抗破坏和对农民的反攻，是会很激烈的，这个斗争也不是一下子就可以结束的。至于在思想上这种斗争还要继续到一定时期的。而这种激烈的斗争有时还通过各种形式具体表现出来。同时由于富农经济的存在，富农和雇农间的阶级斗争仍然是存在的，但在新民主主义的政权下，富农和雇农的斗争是可以在发展生产的大前提下，根据劳资两利原则加以适当解决的。
    此外，土地改革后，相当时期仍然会有贫雇农的。首先，翻身后的贫雇农，在一定时间内其成份是不易改变的。其次，土地改革之后还可能发生新的贫雇农，因为，有些农民因生活条件比较不利，或者不努力生产，或不善于经营，或者遇到某些不可抗拒的打击，他们的经济就不能发展，而逐渐地贫困下来，而其中有一部分就不能不受人剥削而变为新的贫农或雇农。这种情况，即在新民主主义的社会里也是很难避免的，而且是被允许的，不可怕的，因为这种情况不可能改变新民主主义的农村经济的基本形态及其发展前途。再其次，在保存富农经济的情况下，某些地区会产生不能充分满足贫雇农土地要求的现象；国家虽可用贷款等方式帮助农民，但农村中部分贫雇农仍会在一定时期内存在的。
    二、土地改革完成后是否仍会出现土地再一次集中、农民失去土地的情况？
    问：土地改革法第三十条中规定，在土地改革完成后，人民政府承认一切土地所有者自由经营、买卖及出租其土地的权利。试问：这样会不会再一次引起土地的集中，而使许多农民失去土地？
    答：就一般的规律说，在土地私有制未经废除之前，土地所有权变动的现象总是可能发生的。中国现阶段的土地改革，只是没收了封建地主的私有土地，并没有没收农民的私有土地。从地主没收来的土地，一般的又都是分配给无地少地的农民（京郊除外）。那么，一部分农户由于目前还无法抗拒的天灾、人祸、或经营不善、迁移、转业等原因，会出卖或出租自己的土地。另外一部分农户由于人口增多、劳动力增多、或经营得法、有了盈余，也会承租或购买土地。也有一些资本家会在经营农业生产有利之时，投资购买或承租土地。
    但是，在土地改革后的土地所有权的变动，是有限度的，不可能形成大规模的土地集中。原因是：领导土地改革的不是资产阶级的政权，而是在无产阶级领导下的人民民主专政的政权。这个政权一方面为了消除地主对农民的苛重剥削，提高农民生产的积极性，实行没收地主土地、分配给农民的土地改革政策；一方面在土地改革以后，又进一步组织与领导农民实行合作、互助，并由国家进行贷款与在肥料、种籽、农具、农药等方面给予大力扶助，同时又实行合理负担政策，使农民一般不至因生产中的困难而像过去一样去接受高利贷或其他形式的剥削，重新丧失土地。对于水旱等天灾，政府也要进行可能的救济与预防，使其为害的范围缩小，为害的程度减轻。对于捐税与物价，国家会逐步地使它调整得更加合理，使农民不致像在地主资产阶级统治下那样负担不合理的苛重捐税。这样，各种迫使农民丧失土地、走向破产的最主要原因消除了，封建性的或资本主义性的大规模土地集中就成为不可能。请看东北与华北解放区土地改革后农民生活普遍上升的情形，即可明了。
    自然，土地改革后的土地分散的情况，经过相当时期后，又要改变的。在共产党和人民政府的领导和教育下，广大农民必然会通过实际的生产经验认识这种分散的土地私有制度还不是最好的制度。原因是分散的农民无力充分施用肥料，也不能大量利用进步的机器和设备，使农业生产力的提高与农民生活的改善都有其一定的限度。只有走农业集体化的道路，像苏联的集体农庄那样，才能给生产力的发展与农民生活的提高开辟无限远大的前途。那时候土地也是集中了，但那和封建社会及资本主义社会的土地集中是有本质上的不同。后者是在土地私有制的基础上集中在少数地主的手里，而前者则在土地公有制的基础上，农民用集体方式来从事大规模的农业生产。这是新中国农业生产的远景。
    三、关于征收寺院与教堂在农村中的土地问题及其他
    问：土地改革法中所规定的征收寺院与教堂在农村中的土地，包括那些教堂与寺院？        
        张济武
    答：根据土地改革法的规定，一般地区，征收寺院与教堂在农村的土地，包括一切寺院与教堂在内。只是“清真寺所有的土地，在当地回民的同意下，得酌予保留。”就是说，在处理清真寺的土地问题时，应征求当地回民的意见；如果当地回民同意保留清真寺的土地，可以酌予保留，不加分配。至于少数民族地区则又当别论。
    问：在土地改革中，没收及分配地主在乡村中的多余房屋时，是否连屋内的家具一起原封不动的没收、分配？如果是，那么每间屋内的家具多少与好坏相差很大时，怎么处理？              何殷初
    答：房屋中的家具应随房屋没收分配，但为了使用方便，彼此可作合理的调整。
    问：土地改革法第四条为什么规定“地主兼营的工商业及其直接用于经营工商业的土地和财产，不得没收。”？其所指“直接用于经营工商业的土地和财产”，是指的那些？如兼营纱厂的地主的棉田，以及兼营面粉厂的地主的麦田，是否属于此类？
    答：按中央人民政府政务院关于划分农村阶级成份的决定中乙项第十四条的规定“其（指地主——编者）工商业及与工商业相连的厂屋、店铺、住房、财产等不没收。”显然，土地改革法第四条所指“直接用于经营工商业的‘土地’，即政务院颁发划阶级文件中所指厂屋、店铺、住房等所占土地。你所说兼营纱厂的地主棉田，及兼营面粉厂的地主麦田，是地主进行封建剥削的工具，不属于“直接用于经营工商业的土地”的范围，当然不在“不得没收”之列，而应当在没收之列了。
