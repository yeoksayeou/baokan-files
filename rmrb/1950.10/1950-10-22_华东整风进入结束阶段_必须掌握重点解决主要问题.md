East China Rectification Enters the Final Stage
    It is Essential to Grasp the Key Points and Solve the Main Problems
    Special Correspondent of this newspaper, Lin Wei
    The rectification movement in various parts of the East China Administrative Region has entered its final stage. It is expected that most areas and units will conclude it before the end of October. The East China Rectification Movement has been carried out through steps and methods such as rectification mobilization, studying documents, reviewing and summarizing work, and conducting criticism and self-criticism. Now, various regions and units are actively studying ways to improve their work, with the aim of making rapid progress after the rectification.

    An Important Link in Rectification Preparation is to Do a Good Job in Ideological Mobilization
    The rectification mobilization and preparation work in various parts of East China generally began in July. However, due to different work situations, some began in August. One of the most important links in the preparation work is to do a good job in the ideological mobilization of the rectification, so that the general cadres understand the purpose and methods of this rectification, the differences in the environment in which the past two rectifications were located, and the different requirements for rectification. Eliminate ideological concerns and correct rectification attitudes. For example, some cadres have made certain mistakes, or have heard about how the past rectifications were, and are therefore afraid; some have been through rectification and party consolidation in the past and feel that there is nothing to do this time; some believe that "there is bureaucracy above and commandism below," which has nothing to do with them (organ cadres). Therefore, when studying documents, they stubbornly delve into the corners of the horns and chew on nouns. When connecting with reality, they just casually put a "ism" label on themselves. Or they are only prepared to "fire" at a certain leader. The way to correct this is to guide everyone to pay attention to the problems in their current work, so that everyone clearly recognizes that the purpose of this rectification is to summarize the work and solve some urgent problems that need to be solved. Around these problems, solve the relevant ideological and work style problems of leading cadres and general cadres. In this way, studying documents and connecting with reality both become conscious.

    In order to implement the principles and methods of this rectification and to do a good job in the specific preparation work for the rectification, Zhejiang, Fujian and other provinces adopted the method of convening party representative meetings or cadre meetings at each level. Nanjing first held an enlarged meeting of the Municipal Party Committee and a party congress. Shanghai first ran a rectification class to train rectification backbones in various systems. Preliminary deliberations were made in the rectification class, and then rectification meetings were held level by level, starting from the Municipal Party Committee. Other regions and units generally adopted the above methods.

    One of the Keys to Carrying Out the Rectification Movement is for Leading Cadres to Make Rectification Reports
    One of the keys to carrying out the rectification movement correctly and in depth is for leading cadres to make rectification reports. This report should include a summary of the main work over the past year or so, affirming what the achievements are, what the important shortcomings and errors are, and what the main problems are with the leadership style and the general cadre style. This report should be made as early as possible, and it should have a full spirit of self-criticism, not just blaming subordinates; it should be able to raise the main problems in work and style, rather than listing phenomena in a piecemeal fashion. In general areas and units in East China, the rectification reports were made a little late, so that the time for general cadres to study documents was extended to one or even two months, and they could not learn, which made the initial stage a bit lax. Some also blindly emphasized personal examination and personal reflection, forming a situation where they were looking for personal problems away from work, causing emotional fluctuations. However, after the leading comrades made the rectification reports, this situation was mostly reversed, and the rectification began to get on the right track.

    In order to do a good job in the rectification report, the responsible comrades of many regions and units once held symposiums or conducted individual talks, soliciting the opinions of the main cadres of the various departments and systems under their jurisdiction, repeatedly discussing and studying, analyzing various situations, and reaching a consensus on basic understanding, so that the content of the report was enriched, the problems were raised clearly and pertinently, and the self-criticism was done practically and sincerely. This report is both an outline for everyone to check their work and a typical demonstration of self-criticism. If this report is done well, the progress of the rectification will generally be smoother, and better results can be achieved in a shorter period of time. For example, where there was originally a gap between superiors and subordinates, and inspections and criticisms could not be carried out smoothly, after this report, the gap was eliminated, and they began to earnestly inspect and earnestly conduct criticism and self-criticism. Those who could not grasp the center and were at a loss now found a clear path and goal. The Shanghai Municipal Taxation Bureau focused on the "contradiction" between policies and tasks, the Xuzhou Municipal Labor Bureau focused on labor-capital consultation meetings and industrial and mining safety and hygiene, the Shandong Huimin Prefectural Department Store focused on public-private relations, price policies, and safekeeping of state property, and the Shanghai Public Security Bureau based its work on the principle of "combining leniency and suppression" and "being ruthless to the enemy and harmonious to ourselves," checking important deviations in work and style.

    However, there are also a few units whose rectification reports of leading cadres were not well done, causing the movement to take some detours. Some of them were general and listed phenomena, and did not raise any key issues. Or the number of key points raised was as many as five or six or more, and it was impossible to check and summarize them one by one carefully in a short period of time, resulting in confusion. Or they could not find the focus of checking work, so they took vague topics such as the relationship between leaders and those led, and criticism and self-criticism in the organs as the focus of checking, which affected the checking of specific work. There are also those who lack the spirit of self-criticism in leading cadres, and do not mention their own mistakes and shortcomings, but specialize in criticizing and blaming subordinate cadres, forming an opposition between superiors and subordinates and a sense of depression, which is difficult to turn around for a long time. This situation is being worked hard to correct. Some have already been corrected.

    Only by Letting Go of Work with Leadership Can We Criticize Shortcomings and Errors
    In checking work and carrying out criticism, in order to achieve practical results, we must let everyone speak freely and do everything we can. However, this kind of letting go must be letting go with leadership. Otherwise, confusion will occur. The method adopted by various units in East China is to convene meetings of cadres above the section chief level in advance, reach a consensus on various major issues, form a leading core, and then let everyone express their opinions, check their work, and launch criticisms. In this way, on the one hand, it can become a conscious and large-scale mass movement, and on the other hand, it will not cause confusion. This approach has achieved great results in the rectification. Many important shortcomings and errors were revealed. For example, many cadres have "leftist" sentiments towards national capitalists, foreign-funded enterprises, churches and retained personnel, and intellectuals, and do not pay attention to policies; the affairs in many leading organs are busy and chaotic, seriously wasting time and energy; in the operation of state-owned enterprises, the lack of investigation and research constantly causes serious losses to state property; many counties issue orders and make decisions indiscriminately in leading farmers' production, and if they cannot be implemented, they force orders, causing the masses to suffer undue losses and arousing resentment towards the government. Many of these serious facts have awakened leading cadres and general cadres, and they deeply feel the urgent need to improve their work and change their work style. Everyone is wholeheartedly looking for a way forward.

    However, there are also a few units that did not reach a consistent understanding with the main cadres on the main issues before letting go of the mobilization, nor did they form a leading core, resulting in confusion. In addition, some leading cadres, starting from their so-called "prestige," not only do not seriously engage in self-criticism, but also suppress the criticism of subordinates against the leaders. Therefore, the general cadres are lifeless, neither criticizing the leaders nor criticizing themselves. The relationship between superiors and subordinates is getting worse and worse, and they cannot figure out the work. The general cadres reflected: "We knew a long time ago that rectification would not solve the problem." This stalemate has not been completely broken in individual units so far, and a thorough solution must be sought in the final stage.

    Checking work should be done level by level. Because in the same work, each level has its own responsibilities. Some units only do general checks and personal checks, and neglect the checks of the middle level, which will affect the improvement of work in the future.

    Checking work, checking individuals, improving work, and studying documents cannot be mechanically divided into stages.

    While checking work and criticizing leaders, we should also check the ideological and work style of the cadres themselves, and clearly recognize what the responsibility of the leadership is and what their own responsibilities are. Some units mechanically divide the "work checking stage" and the "personal checking stage," stipulating "a few days to check work and a few days to check individuals," resulting in simply expressing opinions to leaders and simply blaming leaders when checking work; when checking individuals, it becomes specializing in finding personal problems. As a result, the responsibilities are unclear and it is difficult to distinguish right from wrong. Individual units have regulations for checking work for four days and checking individuals for twelve days, which is even more topsy-turvy, and it is easy to trace personal details and fail to solve problems in work.

    Checking work should be closely linked to possible and necessary improvements, and there is no need to mechanically divide stages. Whatever has been checked and discovered and can be corrected at that time can be corrected at any time. Some organs reviewed that there were too many levels of receiving and sending documents, and the time was too long. After everyone's research, they immediately changed the more than ten levels of procedures to six or seven levels, and the time was reduced from ten days to three or four days to a week, so everyone's interest and confidence in rectification became higher and higher. However, there are also some organs that, while checking and criticizing red tape, still mechanically forward the documents from the higher authorities without studying them, and do not mention a word about how to implement them. The rectification has been stuck in meetings and on paper.

    Checking work and studying documents cannot be mechanically divided into stages. When studying documents, we must connect with checking work, and when checking work, we must also connect with studying documents. In this way, the problems that have been checked can be raised to the ideological and principled level. Some units have achieved very good results by determining special supplementary documents to study based on the main problems they have discovered.

    In the Current Concluding Stage, We Must Grasp the Key Points, Solve the Main Problems, and Formulate Methods for Improving Work.
    The most important issue in the current stage is to find ways to improve, and to formulate plans and steps for improving work. After rectification, the general cadres have improved their consciousness and enthusiasm for work compared with the past. Now, they generally require the leading cadres to lead them to study the way to improve. If this is not met, the heat will cool down. The rectification will have a beginning but no end and will fall short of success.

    How to improve? The East China Bureau's Directly Subordinate Units Rectification Committee pointed out in its notice on the summary of party rectification issues earlier this month: "We must firmly grasp the key points and solve the main problems. If many general opinions are put forward, but the main problems are not solved, then the rectification cannot be considered to have achieved basic results. Conversely, if the main problems are solved, other minor problems may also be solved easily." What various units can actually do at present is only to solve one or two of the most important and urgent problems. Therefore, it is not a good practice for some units to draft a thick book of improvement plans and working regulations and rules in all aspects. Because it is impossible to achieve so many things at once. If it cannot be cashed, it will cause disappointment.

    Among the general cadres, we should overcome the passive emotions of waiting for the superiors to improve and the impatient emotions of hoping to solve all problems at once. Leading cadres should guide everyone to conduct concrete research actively but realistically: clarify which ones can be solved immediately and how to solve them; which ones cannot be solved immediately and need to be solved gradually. Among the leading cadres, we should pay more attention to soliciting reasonable suggestions from subordinates, guiding everyone to discuss, and not just thinking of solutions behind closed doors. However, it is necessary to prepare more yourself and have a good idea of what to do.

    For individual units that have not completely reversed the antagonistic emotions because the self-criticism of leading cadres has not been done well, the leading cadres should collect opinions and redo the inspection and self-criticism, or make supplementary reviews. And first seek unanimous opinions among the main cadres, so that the recognition of all cadres can be obtained through the main cadres. Do not use organizational pressure to solve problems roughly.

　　华东整风进入结束阶段
    必须掌握重点解决主要问题
    本报特派记者  林韦
    华东大行政区各地整风运动，已进入结束阶段。预计十月底以前，大部地区与多数单位均可结束。华东整风运动是经过整风动员、学习文件、检查总结工作、展开批评与自我批评等步骤和方法进行的。现在各地区、各单位正积极研究改进工作的办法，以期经过整风，使工作能迅速前进。
    整风准备的重要环节是做好思想动员工作
    华东各地和各单位的整风动员和准备工作，一般是从七月份开始。但因工作情况不同，也有从八月份开始的。准备工作中最重要的环节之一，是做好整风的思想动员，使一般干部了解此次整风的目的与做法，是与过去两次整风所处环境的不同，整风要求的不同，消除思想顾虑，端正整风态度。如有些干部，犯过某些错误，或听说过去整风如何如何，因而害怕；有的过去经过整风整党，觉得这次没有什么；有的认为“上有官僚主义、下有命令主义”，与己无关（机关干部）。因而在学习文件时也是硬钻牛角，啃名词。联系实际时便是给自己随便戴个什么“主义”的帽子。或者仅仅准备对某某领导人“开火”。纠正的办法，是引导大家注意当前自己所担负的工作中的问题，使大家明确认识此次整风就是要总结工作解决一些迫切需要解决的问题。围绕这些问题，联系解决领导干部与一般干部的有关的思想作风问题。这样使学习文件与联系实际都成为自觉的。
    为了贯彻此次整风的方针与做法，并做好整风的具体准备工作，浙江、福建等省采取逐级召开党代表会或干部会。南京是先开市委扩大会、党代会。上海是先办了一期整风班，培养各系统整风骨干。在整风班中先作初步酝酿，然后从市委开始，逐级召开整风会议。其他各地区各单位，也一般采用了以上几种方式。
    开展整风运动关键之一是领导干部作整风报告
    正确地、深入地开展整风运动的关键之一，是领导干部作整风报告。这报告应该包括一年多以来主要工作的总结，肯定成绩是什么，重要的缺点与错误是什么，领导作风与一般干部作风的主要毛病是什么。这报告应该尽早做，并且要有充分的自我批评精神，不要光责备下级；要能提出工作上与作风上的主要问题，而不是零零碎碎地列举现象。华东一般地区与单位，整风报告做得少为晚了一点，以致一般干部学习文件的时间拉长至一月甚至二月，学不进去，使开始阶段有点松懈。有的并曾盲目地强调个人检查、个人反省，形成离开工作去找个人毛病，引起情绪波动。但在领导同志做了整风报告之后，这种情况便大部扭了转来，整风开始纳入正轨。
    为了做好整风报告，许多地区与单位的负责同志曾经召开座谈会或进行个别谈话，征求所属各部门各系统主要干部的意见，反复多次商讨研究，分析各种情况，取得基本认识上的一致，使报告内容充实，问题提得明确中肯，自我批评做得切实、诚恳。这报告既是大家检查工作的提纲，也是自我批评的典型示范。这个报告做得好的，整风的进程一般就比较顺利，而在较短时间内能取得较好的收获。如：原来上下级之间有隔阂，检查与批评都不能顺利开展的，经过这一报告，也就消除了隔阂，开始认真检查、认真进行批评与自我批评了。原来抓不住中心，茫无头绪的，现在找到了明确道路与目标。上海市税局以政策与任务“矛盾”为中心，徐州市劳动局以劳资协商会议与工矿安全卫生为中心，山东惠民专区百货公司以公私关系、物价政策和保管国家资财为中心，上海公安局是根据“宽大与镇压结合”、“对敌狠、对己和”的原则，检查工作与作风中的重要偏向。
    但是，也有少数单位的领导干部的整风报告做得不好，致使运动走了一些弯路。其中有的是一般化、现象罗列，没提出什么问题是重点。或者是提的重点多至五、六个以上，不可能在短期内一一细致检查总结，结果仍然是混乱的。或者是找不到检查工作的重点，便以领导与被领导关系、机关中批评与自我批评之类的笼统题目为检查重点，结果影响了具体工作的检查。也有的是领导干部缺乏自我批评精神，明明自己有错误、有缺点而不提，专门批评与责备下级干部，形成上下对立、情绪消沉，好久转不过来。这种情形，正在努力纠正。有的已经纠正了。
    有领导的放手检查工作才能作到批评缺点错误
    在检查工作与开展批评中，要收得切实的效果，必须放手让大家说话，做到知无不言、言无不尽。但这种放手，必须是有领导的放手。否则会发生混乱。华东各单位所采取的办法，是事先召开科长以上干部会议，在各项主要问题上取得意见一致，形成领导核心，然后放手让大家提意见，进行检查工作，展开批评。这样，一方面可以成为自觉的、大规模的群众运动，一方面也不致引起混乱。这种做法，使整风获得很大成果。揭发出许多重要的缺点与错误。如许多干部对待民族资本家、外商企业、教会与留用人员、知识分子的“左”倾情绪，不重视政策；许多领导机关中的事务忙乱、严重浪费时间精力；经营国家企业中因缺乏调查研究，不断造成国家资财的严重损失；许多县份在领导农民生产中乱发命令、乱作决定，执行不通，便强迫命令，使群众遭受不应有的损失，引起对政府的反感。其中许多严重事实，警醒了领导干部与一般干部，痛感到改进工作，改变作风的迫切需要。大家都一心一德寻找前进之路。
    但是，也有少数单位，在放手发动之前，没有在主要问题上取得主要干部的一致认识，也未组成领导核心，结果发生混乱现象。另有一些单位的领导干部从个人的所谓“威信”出发，不但自己不认真自我批评，还压制下级干部对领导的批评。因而一般干部死气沉沉，既不批评领导，也不批评自己。上下级关系越整越坏，工作也摸不着头脑。一般干部反映说：“早就知道整风不解决问题。”这种僵局，个别的单位至今仍未完全打开，须在结束阶段中求得彻底解决。
    检查工作应该是逐级的检查。因为在同一项工作中，各级有各级的责任。有的单位只做总的检查与个人检查，忽视了中层的检查，将来改进工作上是会受到影响的。
    检查工作，检查个人，改进工作，学习文件，都不能机械划分阶段。
    检查工作与批评领导同时，应联系进行干部自身思想作风的检查，明确认识领导上的责任是什么，自己应负的责任是什么。有的单位机械划分“检查工作阶段”与“检查个人阶段”、规定“几天检查工作，几天检查个人，”结果形成检查工作时单纯对领导提意见，单纯责备领导；检查个人时又成了专找个人毛病。以至最后责任不清，是非难辨。个别单位有规定四天检查工作、十二天检查个人的，更是轻重倒置，很容易造成追查个人细节，解决不了工作上的问题。
    检查工作应该与可能的必要的改进密切联系进行，不必机械划分阶段。凡是已经检查发现、并为当时所能改正的，即可随时改正。有的机关检讨到收文发文的层次太多，迁延时间太长，立即经过大家研究，将十多层手续改为六、七层，时间从十来天减到三、四天至一星期，所以大家对整风的兴趣与信心便越来越高。但也有的机关一面检查批判文牍主义，一面依旧将上级公文不加研究地机械转发下去，怎样执行，一字不提，整风一直停留在会议上与书面上。
    检查工作与学习文件不能机械地划分阶段，学文件时要联系检查工作，检查工作时也要联系学习文件。这样使检查出来的问题能提高到思想原则上来认识。有些单位根据所发现的主要问题确定专门的补充文件来学习，曾取得很好效果。
    目前结束阶段中，要掌握重点，解决主要问题，制定改进工作办法。
    目前阶段中最主要的问题，是寻找改进办法，制定改进工作的计划与步骤。一般干部经过整风，工作的自觉性与积极性是较前提高了。现在普遍要求领导干部领导他们研究改进之道。如不予以满足，热气是会冷却的。整风是会有头无尾、功亏一篑的。
    怎样改进呢？华东局直属单位整风委员会本月上旬关于党内整风总结问题的通知中指出：“必须紧紧掌握重点，解决主要问题。如果一般的意见提得很多，但主要问题没有解决，那么整风就不能算获得基本成绩。反之，主要问题解决了，其他次要问题也就有可能迎刃而解。”目前各单位所能做到的，实际只能是解决一、二最主要最迫切的问题。所以有的单位面面俱到地起草了一厚册一厚册的改进计划与工作条例、细则，就不是好的做法。因为一下子实现那许多是不可能的。如果不能兑现，反而会发生失望情绪。
    在一般干部中，应该克服等待上级来改进的被动情绪和希望一下子解决一切问题的急燥情绪。领导干部应该引导大家积极地但是实事求是地进行具体研究：弄清那些是即可解决的，应该怎样解决；那些是目前不可能马上解决、而需要逐步解决的。在领导干部中，应多注意广泛征求下级的合理建议，引导大家讨论，不应光凭自己关起门子想办法。但是，自己多做准备，心里有数，则是需要的。
    有个别单位由于领导干部自我批评做得不好，至今未完全扭转对抗情绪的，应由领导干部搜集意见，重做检查与自我批评，或做补充检讨。并先在主要干部中征得一致意见，以便经过主要干部取得全体干部认识上的一致。切忌施用组织压力，粗暴地解决问题。
