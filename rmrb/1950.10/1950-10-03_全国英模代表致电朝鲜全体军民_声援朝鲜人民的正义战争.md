Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: The entire body of representatives from the National Combat Heroes Representative Conference and the National Worker-Peasant-Soldier Labor Model Representative Conference sent the following telegram to the entire Korean military and people:

To all the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army and all the people of Korea:

	As the representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's combat heroes and the national worker-peasant-soldier labor models are holding representative conferences in Beijing, we extend our most enthusiastic blessings to the heroic Korean people, wishing them final victory in their just war against the armed aggression of American imperialism and its accomplices, for the realization of Korea's independence and unification, and for the defense of world peace. We pay our respects to the esteemed General Kim Il-sung, to the Korean people who resolutely defend their motherland, and to all the brave and skilled officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army.

	From the first day that American imperialism and its running dog, the traitorous Syngman Rhee gang, launched their aggression on the 38th parallel, they suffered severe blows from your iron fists. In more than one hundred days of intense and brutal combat, you disregarded the enemy's frantic bombing and naval shelling, highly displaying a spirit of tenacity and perseverance, overcoming all difficulties, and annihilating the enemy in large numbers. This is your glorious and immortal achievement. Every strike you inflict upon the enemy inspires us and all peace-loving people around the world. Now, the Korean people's liberation war has entered a new stage. The American bandits and their lackeys, relying on their temporary superiority in land, sea, and air forces, have reoccupied Seoul and many cities in the southern line after paying a heavy price. While this inevitably makes the Korean people's liberation war a difficult, tortuous, and protracted struggle, it cannot save the American bandits from their ultimate defeat. The ferocious American bandits bloodily massacre peaceful Korean people, savagely bombard peaceful cities and villages, and barbarously impose the barbaric rule of the traitorous executioner Syngman Rhee on the Korean people. All this can only increase the Korean people's determination for revenge and can never prevent the Korean people from achieving final victory.

Dear Korean Comrades! The Chinese people will always stand with you and always support your just war. We believe that, with the close unity of all peace-loving people in the world and the great cooperation of the world's anti-aggression front led by the Soviet Union, we will be able to finally crush the shameless conspiracy of the American imperialists to enslave Korea, Asia, and the world.

Long live the leader of the Korean people, General Kim Il-sung!
Long live the brave and skilled Korean People's Army!
Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!
Long live the great friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean peoples!
Long live the world peace and democracy front headed by the Soviet Union!

　　全国英模代表致电朝鲜全体军民
    声援朝鲜人民的正义战争
    【新华社二日讯】全国战斗英雄代表会议和全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议全体代表致朝鲜全体军民电文如下：
    朝鲜人民军全体将士和朝鲜的全体人民：
    当我们中国人民解放军全体战斗英雄代表和全国工农兵劳动模范代表，在北京举行代表会议的时候，我们以无限热烈的心情，祝福英勇的朝鲜人民，为了实现朝鲜的独立与统一，为了保卫世界和平，在反对美帝国主义及其帮凶们武装侵略的正义战争中获得最后胜利。我们向敬爱的金日成将军致敬，向坚决保卫祖国的朝鲜人民致敬，向英勇善战的朝鲜人民军全体将士致敬。
    美帝国主义及其走狗卖国贼李承晚匪帮们，在三八线上发动侵略的第一天起，就遭受到你们铁拳的严重打击。在一百多天的剧烈残酷战斗中，你们不顾敌机疯狂的轰炸和敌舰的炮击，高度发扬坚韧顽强的斗争精神，排除一切困难，大量地歼灭敌人，这是你们所建立的光荣的不朽的功绩。你们每一次对于敌人的打击，都鼓舞了我们和全世界爱好和平的人民。现在，朝鲜人民解放战争，已进入新的阶段。美国强盗及其嘍囉们，依靠暂时的陆、海、空军的优势，在付出惨重代价以后从新强占了汉城和南线的许多城市，这虽然不可免地要使朝鲜人民的解放战争成为艰苦、曲折和持久的斗争，但并不能挽救美国强盗最后失败的命运。穷凶极恶的美国强盗们，血腥地屠杀朝鲜和平人民，兽性地滥炸和平城市与村庄，横蛮地将卖国贼刽子手李承晚的野蛮统治强加在朝鲜人民身上，这一切只能更增加朝鲜人民的复仇决心，绝不能阻止朝鲜人民取得最后胜利。
    亲爱的朝鲜战友们！中国人民永远和你们站在一起，始终声援你们的正义战争。我们相信，在全世界爱好和平人民的亲密团结和以苏联为首的世界反侵略阵线的伟大合作下，我们一定能够最后粉碎美帝国主义者企图奴役朝鲜、亚洲和全世界的无耻阴谋。
    朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军万岁！
    英勇善战的朝鲜人民军万岁！
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！
    中、朝两国人民伟大的友谊和团结万岁！
    以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵线万岁！
    中国人民解放军全国战斗英雄代表会议全体代表
    中华人民共和国全国工、农、兵劳动模范代表会议全体代表
    一九五○年十月二日
