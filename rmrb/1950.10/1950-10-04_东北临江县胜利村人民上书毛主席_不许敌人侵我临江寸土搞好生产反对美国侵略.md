　　People of Shengli Village, Linjiang County, Northeast China, Petition Chairman Mao:
    We Will Not Allow the Enemy to Invade an Inch of Our Land in Linjiang, We Will Focus on Production and Oppose American Aggression
    [Reported by this newspaper] The people of Linjiang County, Liaodong Province, who bravely cooperated with the People's Liberation Army in the winter of 1946 during the intense Northeast Liberation War and achieved brilliant results, are extremely angry at the barbaric act of the American imperialist aircraft that intruded into the county's airspace on August 27 and unreasonably killed and injured our compatriots. All the villagers of Shengli Village, District 7 of the county, wrote to Chairman Mao on National Day, reporting on the increase in production and the increasingly prosperous lives of the farmers since the completion of the land reform, and resolved to respond to the provocations of the American imperialists by doing a good job in the autumn harvest. The original letter is as follows:

Respected Chairman Mao:

　　Under your leadership, our lives have changed greatly. In the past, we suffered hardships, sins, and oppression; now, we have food, clothing, and freedom. Recalling the time before "September 18th," Chiang Kai-shek, this traitor, sold us out, and we suffered fourteen years of oppression under the Japanese devils. They conscripted labor, drafted "national soldiers," demanded grain deliveries, and the traitorous police oppressed the people with exorbitant taxes and levies. The hardships were countless, and the over 1,200 people in our village were abandoned in the fire pit.

　　Dear Chairman Mao: Thanks to your wise leadership, the Eighth Route Army fought hard for eight years and cooperated with the Soviet army to defeat the Japanese devils on August 15, 1945. All 30 million people in Northeast China saw the light of day. We thought, "This is great, from now on we can live a peaceful life." But Chiang Kai-shek, that bad guy, only cared about fighting a civil war. But the people of Linjiang were not intimidated by him. In December 1946, the Kuomintang troops frantically attacked Linjiang's doorstep—Wudaojiang (three *hua li* from Linjiang). Our troops engaged in fierce battles with the enemy, and the people in the rear took up stretchers, delivered public grain, made military shoes, and so on, voluntarily supporting the front line. Our village is ten *li* away from here, and the "calamity army" did not come. Because our war was just and received the support of the broad masses of the people, we finally drove the enemy back. We fought the enemy four times in this way, which is the famous "Four Defenses of Linjiang."

　　"Four Defenses of Linjiang" Repulsed the Chiang Bandit Army
    For Several Years, Life Has Risen Day by Day
　　After repelling the Kuomintang bandits, in the autumn of 1947, under the leadership of the democratic government, land reform began. The 225 poor, hired, and middle peasant households in our village were allocated more than 3,900 *mu* of land, more than 90 houses, five carts, and 50 head of livestock. After four years of active production, the lives of every household in our village have become prosperous. Families who used to lack food and clothing now have more grain than they can eat, and almost everyone has new clothes. This year's harvest is not too bad, the grain we harvested is still more than we can eat, it would be even better if it wasn't so dry. Since the land reform, our village has added 20 carts, 32 head of cattle, 11 horses, and built more than 30 new houses. This autumn, we will add more livestock and carts. Most of these things are in the hands of our poor, hired, and middle peasants, so future production will not be difficult. The mutual aid teams have been doing better in the past two years, and they have harvested more grain. Take Chen Tingshan's team as an example: when it was first organized in 1947, the six households harvested 166.5 *shi* of grain in the autumn, with an average of 7 *shi* of grain per worker. In 1948, two more households were added, and they harvested a total of 176.5 *shi* of grain, with an average of 13 *shi* per worker. In 1949, they harvested a total of 266.8 *shi* of grain, with an average of 19 *shi* per worker. This year, the entire team has also opened up more than 15 *mu* of paddy fields to grow rice, and together with the more than 8 *mu* of paddy fields from last year, the rice is growing very well, and we expect a 90% yield, estimating a harvest of about 80 *shi* of rice. We have also opened up more than 20 *mu* of dry land, which can yield more than 20 *shi* of grain. Each laborer will average at least 20 *shi* of grain in the fall. Because the land was waterlogged, they also dug more than 20 drainage ditches, which improved the soil quality and increased the yield by nearly two times (the normal yield was 4.5 *dou*, but after improvement, it yielded more than 1 *shi*). Most people in our village have harvested a lot more grain since they organized themselves.

　　American Imperialism Destroys Our Good Life
    We Must Firmly Express Our Protest
　　Our days are getting better and better. But on August 27, the hateful American planes intruded into the skies over our Linjiang, carrying out barbaric strafing, damaging three locomotives, one passenger car, one baggage car, one guard car, and many other things, blowing off the left hand of Comrade Xu Guochen, the driver, and injuring worker Wang Yihong.

　　Chairman Mao: Under your leadership, the Chinese people have stood up! In the three years of the Liberation War, Linjiang did not allow the Kuomintang bandits to enter an inch of its land. Today, American planes shamelessly intrude into our Linjiang, damage our trains, etc., and injure our compatriots Xu Guochen, Wang Yihong, and others. Can we let them bully us? The land of Linjiang must not allow the aircraft of American imperialism to intrude and harass us unreasonably! We will remember this blood debt! We are determined to take practical action to increase production and do a good job in the autumn harvest to oppose the shameless provocations of the American imperialists. We wish you good health!

　　All the people of Shengli Village, District 7, Linjiang County, Liaodong Province

　　东北临江县胜利村人民上书毛主席
    不许敌人侵我临江寸土搞好生产反对美国侵略
    【本报讯】一九四六年冬，东北解放战争炽烈时，曾奋勇配合人民解放军作战获得辉煌战果的辽东省临江县人民，对八月二十七日美帝国主义者的飞机侵入县境上空无理杀伤我同胞的野蛮暴行，极感愤怒。该县第七区胜利村的全体村民，于国庆节上书毛主席报告该村自土改完成后生产增加，农民光景日趋富裕的情形，并决心以搞好秋收回答美帝国主义者的挑衅。原信如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    在你的领导下，我们的生活大变样了。过去是受苦受罪受压迫，现在是有吃有穿享自由。回想起“九一八”以前，蒋介石这个卖国贼把我们出卖，受了日本鬼子十四年的压迫，抽劳工、挑“国兵”、出荷粮，汉奸警察压迫老百姓，苛捐杂税等等，苦处数也数不清，俺村的一千二百多口人被抛弃在火坑里。
    亲爱的毛主席：多亏了你英明领导，八路军经过八年的苦战，并和苏联军队配合，在一九四五年八月十五日把日本鬼子打败了，全东北三千多万人，这才见到了晴天。我们想：“这可好啦，从此以后可能安安稳稳的过太平日子。”那料到，蒋介石这个坏家伙，一心只顾自己打内战。可是临江的人民没被他吓倒，一九四六年的十二月间国民党的军队疯狂地打到了临江的大门外——五道江（离临江管境三华里），咱们的队伍与敌人展开了激烈的战斗，后方的老百姓就抬担架、缴公粮、做军鞋等等，自动起来支援前线。我们村子离这里十里路，“遭殃军”没来到。因为我们的战争是正义的，得到了广大人民的拥护，终于把敌人打退了。就这样和敌人干了四次，这就是有名的“四保临江”。
    “四保临江”打退蒋匪军  数年来使生活日日上升
    把国民党匪帮打退了以后，一九四七年秋天，在民主政府的领导下，开始了土改。我们村里的二百二十五户贫、雇、中农分得了三千九百多亩土地、九十多间房子、五辆大车、五十头牲口，经过四年来的积极生产，俺村家家户户的生活都富裕了。过去少吃缺穿的人家，现在的粮食吃不了，差不离每人都穿上了新衣裳。今年年景还不太坏，打的粮食还吃不了，要不旱更好啦。咱这村从土改后，添了二十台大车、三十二头牛、十一匹马、新盖了三十多间房子，今秋还要添些牲口和大车，这些东西大多数都在咱贫、雇、中农手里，往后的生产，就不困难啦。互助组这两年比过去搞得也好、打粮也多，就拿陈廷山的组来说吧：一九四七年刚组织的时候，六户秋天打了十六六石五斗粮，每个劳力平均打七石粮。一九四八年增加了两户共打了一百七十六石五斗粮，每个劳力平均十三石。一九四九年共打了二百六十六石八斗粮，每个劳力平均打十九石粮。今年全组又开十五亩多水甸子荒种水田，加上去年的八亩多水田，稻子长得很好，看九成年，估计能打八十来石稻子。还开了二十多亩旱田荒，能打二十多石粮。每个劳动力，到秋平均至少能打二十石粮。他们这组因为地涝还挖了二十多条顺水沟，这一下改良了土质，比常年产量增加将近两倍（常年四斗半改良后打一石多）。我们村的大多数人自从组织起来以后，都多打了不少粮食。
    美帝破坏我们好生活  我们要坚决表示抗议
    眼看着我们的日子天天在上升。可是可恨的美国飞机在八月二十七日侵入了我们临江的上空，施行野蛮的扫射，打坏了三个火车头、一个客车、一个行李车、一个守护车，还有不少的东西，打掉了开车司机徐国臣同志一只左手、打伤了工友王义宏。
    毛主席：在你的领导下，中国人民已经站起来了！临江在三年的解放战争中。没让国民党兵匪进入寸土。今天美国的飞机无耻地侵入我临江，打坏了我们的火车等等，又打伤了我们的同胞徐国臣、王义宏等同志，我们能让它欺侮吗？临江的国土是决不允许美帝国主义的飞机无理侵扰！这一笔血债我们要记下来！我们坚决以增加生产的实际行动把秋收工作搞好，来反对美帝国主义者的无耻挑衅。祝身体健康！
