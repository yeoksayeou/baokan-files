Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 2nd: TASS, Moscow, 2nd, The Soviet government on September 30th sent notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France respectively, refuting the slanders fabricated by the three governments in their notes to the Soviet government on July 14th, which alleged that there were still a large number of German prisoners of war in the Soviet Union.

    The Soviet government's note to the U.S. government reads as follows: "The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received the U.S. government's note of July 14th of this year and deems it necessary to state the following: The U.S. government's above-mentioned note insists that a large number of German prisoners of war remain in the Soviet Union, which is absolutely unfounded and inconsistent with the facts. As stated in the TASS statement of May 5th of this year, the Soviet Union's work on repatriating German prisoners of war was completed in its entirety at the beginning of 1950. All German prisoners of war who were in the Soviet Union have been repatriated, with the exception of 9,717 people who were sentenced for serious war crimes, 3,815 people whose crimes are still under investigation, and 14 people who are temporarily detained due to illness. In view of the detailed materials cited above regarding the repatriation of German prisoners of war from the Soviet Union, the Soviet government is compelled to believe that the repeated statements made by the U.S. government to the Soviet government on this issue have no other explanation than to attempt to use the issue of German prisoners of war for propaganda purposes. The Soviet government has also presented the same note to the British and French governments."

　　苏联境内德国战俘
    已经全部遣送回国
    苏驳斥美英法政府捏造的谰言
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二日讯：苏联政府于九月三十日分别照会美、英、法三国政府，驳复三国政府前在七月十四日致苏联政府照会中捏造苏联境内尚有大批德国战俘的谰言。
    苏联政府致美国政府的照会如下：“苏联外交部已收到美国政府本年七月十四日的照会，认为必须声明如下：美国政府上项照会硬说尚有大量德国战俘留在苏联境内，这种说法是绝对没有根据的，同时也是不符合事实的。如塔斯社本年五月五日的声明所称，苏联遣送德国战俘的工作，已在一九五○年初全部完成。曾经在苏联境内的全部德国战俘都已经遣送回国，只有九千七百十七人因严重的战争罪行而被判刑，三千八百十五人的罪行还在调查中，另有十四人因为疾病而暂时滞留。鉴于以上所引关于从苏联遣送德国战俘的详尽材料，苏联政府不得不认为，美国政府就这个问题对苏联政府所作的屡次声明，除了力图利用德国战俘问题于宣传目的之外，实无其他解释。苏联政府亦向英法两国政府提出了同样的照会。”
