　　Xinhua News Agency, 14th. Lin Minhao, the Northeast Korean ethnic representative and Vice President of Yanbian University of Jilin Province who came to Beijing to participate in the capital's National Day celebrations, delivered a radio speech at the Central People's Broadcasting Station on the evening of the 14th, upon invitation. In his speech, he vehemently denounced the recent series of acts of aggression by US imperialism against our country's Taiwan, Northeast China, and Korea. He said: The open military aggression that US imperialism has already initiated is not limited to Asia; we must fully recognize that engaging in military aggression and undermining human peace is the policy of American imperialism. Wherever there are people fighting for freedom, wherever there are struggles for national liberation, wherever the working class is advancing towards socialism, these are all targets of US imperialist attacks. Representative Lin Minhao praised the heroic resistance of the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea against the American aggression and said: The Korean ethnic people residing in Northeast China fully support the just war of liberation of the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and therefore enthusiastically support the solemn and just statement of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman that the Korean people residing in China have the right to return to defend their motherland. The Korean ethnic people of Northeast China, when commemorating the first anniversary of the People's Republic of China, must fully realize that opposing US imperialist aggression against Korea is to strive for peace and defend our country. The broadcast concluded: We, the Korean ethnic people of Northeast China, will resolutely unite with the people of all ethnic groups in China to fight to the end to defend world peace and oppose the aggression of US imperialism!
　　
　　In addition: Representatives of various fraternal ethnic groups who have come to Beijing this time will successively deliver radio speeches at the Central People's Broadcasting Station.
