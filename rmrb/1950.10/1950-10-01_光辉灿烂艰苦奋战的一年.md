　　A Year of Glorious Splendor and Arduous Struggle
　　Chairman of the Jiusan Society Xu Deheng
　　The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China was established on October 1, 1949, and it has been a year since then. This is our year of glorious splendor, and also our year of arduous struggle!
　　This year is glorious and splendid because the feudalism that bound the Chinese people for more than two thousand years has been overthrown! The imperialism that oppressed the Chinese people for more than a hundred years has been driven out of the mainland! The reactionary regime of Chiang Kai-shek, the bureaucratic comprador capitalist who harmed the Chinese people for more than twenty years, has been defeated! For the first time, the Chinese people independently and autonomously govern their own country and establish their own people's democratic dictatorship. The Chinese people can achieve such great and brilliant achievements, thanks to the wise and correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and thanks to the heroic combat of the People's Liberation Army!
　　It is a year of arduous struggle, and in this year, the Chinese people used their own strength to arduously overcome the unprecedented famine, and overcome the war disasters caused and left over by the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the four-year civil war launched by the Chiang bandits, as well as the various disasters caused by this war!
　　In particular, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, it unified the national financial and economic work, realized the near balance of financial revenue and expenditure, stabilized the national commodity prices generally, stopped the malignant inflation of more than ten years, made industry and commerce flourish, and stabilized people's lives.
　　In order to establish a people's democratic united front regime, in addition to Taiwan and Tibet, more than half of the 28 provinces across the country have convened people's representative conferences in this short year, some of which have only been liberated for a few months; among the more than 2,000 counties across the country, more than 1,800 counties have convened people's representative conferences, many of which have also convened people's congresses and elected their own people's governments; the Northeast, Northwest, and North China, almost all districts and villages, have held people's representative conferences, and some have also held people's congresses and elected their own people's governments.
　　Since Wang Mang, through Wang Anshi, Zhang Juzheng, Hong Xiuquan, and Sun Yat-sen, for more than 1,900 years, our ancestors have tried to reform China's land problem, but they all failed! Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the land reform of one-third of the country's population has been successfully completed; and in this year, the land reform of 100 million agricultural population areas has also been completed. This is truly a great undertaking that shocks the past and present.
　　With the improvement of people's economic life, the progress in culture and education is also changing rapidly. Universities and colleges across the country have begun to open their doors to workers and peasants; worker-peasant middle schools have been established across the country to recruit children of workers and peasants, and spare-time literacy schools have been generally increased to prepare for the elimination of illiteracy. Among the 2 million citizens in Beijing, 490,000 illiterate and semi-illiterate people have been eliminated by one-third this year. In the past, college students were unemployed as soon as they graduated, but this year is not the case. In the government's planned allocation of work, the employment problem has been solved, and the deviation of learning what is not used in the past has also been solved.
　　In terms of diplomacy, the establishment of Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations, as well as the establishment of equal and friendly relations with new democratic countries, especially the conclusion of the glorious and unparalleled Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance with the Soviet Union, and the conclusion of a series of equal and mutually beneficial agreements, have opened a new era in foreign relations in history.
　　These are the most significant achievements of the arduous struggle in the past year!
　　Chairman Mao said: "The liberation of the whole country is the first step in the Long March!" The establishment of the People's Government is only one year old, and it is only the first step in the Long March; surrounding us are still imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek's remnants. We still have Tibet to be recovered, Taiwan to be liberated, and the land reform work across the country to be completely and successfully completed. In this glorious and arduous journey, we must work harder, study harder, and strengthen unity. We must unite with the Chinese Communist Party, unite with the people of the Soviet Union and new democratic countries, and strive to learn from the Chinese Communist Party, learn from Chairman Mao, learn from the Soviet people and Stalin, learn to defeat the enemy, and build a new democratic New China.

### 光辉灿烂艰苦奋战的一年

　　光辉灿烂艰苦奋战的一年
    九三学社主席  许德珩
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府一九四九年十月一日成立，到现在已经一年，这是我们光辉灿烂的一年，也是我们艰苦奋战的一年！
    这一年之所以光辉灿烂，因为束缚中国人民二千多年的封建主义被推翻了！压迫中国人民一百多年的帝国主义在大陆上被驱逐出去了！为害于中国人民二十余年的官僚买办资本主义的蒋介石反动政权被打垮了！中国人民第一次独立自主的来治理自己的国家，建立自己的人民民主专政的政权。中国人民能够得到这样伟大辉煌的成就，是要感谢毛主席及中国共产党之英明正确的领导，是要感谢人民解放军之英勇的作战！
    它是艰苦奋战的，中国人民在这一年之中，用自己的力量，艰苦的战胜了空前未有的灾荒，克服了八年抗日战争与蒋匪所发动的反人民的四年内战所造成并遗留下来的兵灾，以及由这兵灾所演成的各种灾害！
    特别是在中央人民政府的领导下，统一了全国财经工作，实现了财政收支接近平衡，全国物价普遍稳定，使十多年来的恶性通货膨胀宣告停止，工商业欣欣向荣，人民生活趋于稳定。
    为着建立人民民主的统一战线的政权，全国除了台湾西藏以外，二十八省在这短短的一年之中，有的解放还只几个月，召开过人民代表会议的已经一半以上；全国二千多个县中，召开过人民代表会议的已经有一千八百多个县，其中并还有很多召开过人民代表大会，选举出人民自己的政府；东北、西北、华北，几乎全部的区、村，都开过人民代表会议，也有的还开过人民代表大会，选举出人民自己的政府。
    中国的土地问题，从王莽起，经过王安石、张居正、洪秀全、孙中山，这一千九百多年来，我们的先辈都曾经企图有所改革，但都失败了！中国人民在毛主席及中国共产党的正确领导下，占全国三分之一人口的土地改革已经胜利的完成；而在这一年之中完成的，还有一万万农业人口地区的土改。这真是一个震古铄今的伟大事业。
    随着人民经济生活的改善，文教方面的进展也是日新月异的，全国的大学和专科学校，已经开始向工农开门；全国各地已经设立工农中学招收工农子弟，并普遍地增设业余补习学校，加工的来做扫除文盲的准备工作。在北京二百万市民之中，四十九万文盲和半文盲，今年这一年已经扫除了三分之一。往年的大学生一毕业就是失业，今年不是这样了，他们在政府有计划的分配工作之中，解决了就业问题，也解决了从前学非所用的偏差。
    在外交方面，中苏邦交的建立，以及与新民主主义国家建立了平等友善的关系，特别是与苏联缔结了光荣无比的中苏友好同盟互助条约，订立了一连串平等互惠的协定，开辟有史以来对外关系的新纪元。
    这些都是一年来艰苦奋战之最显著的战绩！
    毛主席说：“全国解放是万里长征的第一步！”人民政府之建立还只一年，也还只是万里长征的第一步；环伺我们左右的，还有帝国主义及其走狗蒋匪残余，我们还有西藏尚待收复，台湾尚待解放，全国的土改工作尚待全部的胜利完成，在这光荣而艰苦的事业途程中，我们更要加倍努力，加紧学习，加强团结，我们要团结在中国共产党一起，团结在苏联及新民主主义国家的人民一起，努力的向中国共产党学习，向毛主席学习，向苏联人民及斯大林学习，学习战败敌人，搞好新民主主义的新中国。
