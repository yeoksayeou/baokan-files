To the Editor:

We have read the critical letter from Comrade Lu Bo, a reporter for the Fushun Workers' Daily, published in the People's Forum on September 16th. We now respond to the issues raised by Comrade Lu Bo, based on the actual situation of our factory, as follows:

“The quality of products is poor, and products are not subjected to scientific inspection when they leave the factory, relying only on ‘visual inspection’ for evaluation.” It is true that our factory lacks physical and chemical testing equipment and relies solely on "visual inspection" and simple measuring instruments for inspection. Our factory had this kind of equipment during the Japanese puppet regime, but it was all destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit gangs. It is now difficult to restore this equipment. “Making automatic brake shoes for locomotives for the vehicle factory” was a job our factory received while repairing factories. Given the equipment situation of our factory, it is impossible to manufacture this kind of thing, but because Engineer Li Jiabin of the Fushun Mining Bureau's Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Section instructed a trial production on the project order last year, the trial-produced product was unusable. Regarding the “making of 750-jin steel ingot molds,” it was not 750 jin but a 750-kilogram steel ingot mold. This work was affected by the major overhaul of the Hunhe River Bridge in Fushun, which caused inconvenient transportation and affected the supply of wind-blown sand for sand turning. On the other hand, because our factory urgently needed to solve the problem of mechanical parts for various factories and mines, we had planned to shift the cast iron production in the first half of the year to the work of mining machinery parts. Therefore, although the cast iron task in the first half of the year exceeded the original plan by 33 percent, the steel ingot mold task was not carried out as planned. "The causticizing plates urgently needed by the oil factory, which were to be delivered in March, have not yet been completed." It was not a delivery in March, but an order in March, with delivery in July.

“There were 72 mechanical equipment accidents and 168 injury accidents in the first half of the year.” This number is accurate. Among them, there were seven relatively major equipment accidents, most of which were ordinary accidents caused by old machinery. Among the injury accidents, 22 injured workers were off work for more than two weeks. Most of the injuries were burns or scratches, resulting in minor injuries. We have tried our best to avoid these accidents. The problem of "the electric hammer in the finished product workshop breaking down on May 7, resulting in a 27-day work stoppage" was a scheduled periodic maintenance carried out by the leadership after the spring safety inspection. "The solidification accident of the three-ton iron furnace resulted in a loss of 1 billion Northeast currency." Calculated at cost, the actual loss was only 107 million Northeast currency.

“Lack of system and lax discipline” is caused by poor leadership, but since the Northeast Enterprise Bureau accepted thirteen factories of various sizes in January last year, the number of workers has increased from more than 120 to more than 1,400. At that time, only two machines were running, but now there are more than 300 machines. Technical management personnel come from various fields, each with a set of technical and management experience. Among the new workers, some return home to farm for a few days during the busy season, or engage in petty trade, resulting in high turnover. This has an impact on labor discipline, technical operations, and attendance rates. In addition, the overly dispersed housing makes factory management and leadership extremely difficult. It is not easy to overcome the phenomenon of lax labor discipline in a short year. Regarding the issue of "the leaders have not yet investigated the responsibility for the three-ton iron furnace solidification accident," the leaders have not given up. At the factory's summary conference in July, the responsible persons were given penalties. Deputy Director Zhang and Squad Leader Zhao were each given a major demerit and a pay cut of one grade.

"Unsound planning. The finished product department lacks inspection standards and plans." We originally had inspection plans and inspection standards, but we lacked inspection tools and technically qualified personnel. The entire factory has only a dozen calipers, micrometers, etc. for inspection; most of the more than ten staff members in the inspection department are novice young students. This inevitably created difficulties for the inspection work. "The most important quenching procedure was neglected when making chain plates." We attach importance to every production procedure for making chain plates, and the quenching procedure is no exception. "The houses in the forging field were built and then demolished, and then built again after being demolished." This is because the state did not make new investments in our factory this summer, and our original mining machinery repair and parts factory was changed to a heavy mining machinery manufacturing factory. Therefore, the annual small-scale infrastructure plan has to be changed accordingly. "The small railway was laid and then dismantled, and then laid again after being dismantled." The small railway is a light railway, which is laid at any time as needed. "The heating trench collapsed before it was used." The heating trench project was undertaken by the Fushun Mining Bureau's Works Office last year. The construction by the Works Office was late, and it froze before it was completed. Moreover, there was a shortage of cement last year, and there were no materials to make cement boards. Therefore, our factory cannot be responsible for the heating trench project.

"Unclear rewards and punishments. There have been only five rationalization proposals in the past six months." Our factory gives an average of about 100 million work points in bonuses every month, accounting for 4 percent of the workshop wages, not no rewards. "The leadership did not give a reward for the worker's improvement of the pickaxe sleeve." This is because the original pickaxe sleeve could be used more than 30 times without breaking, but after Comrade Yang Yongrun's modification, it broke after being used two or three times, resulting in a waste of labor and materials. "Luo Yufang proposed a specific shift handover method and system for the three-shift system, but has not received a reply after a month." We accepted Luo Yufang's suggestion and implemented the three-shift system from July 1st. However, there were many problems with the implementation. Apprentices account for half of the workers, taking a shift, which has a great adverse effect on the apprentices' learning, technical operation, machine maintenance, and product quality. Secondly, old lathes are running continuously, which seriously affects the life of the machinery. Therefore, the results of the trial run confirmed that the objective conditions do not allow the implementation of the three-shift system in our factory at present. Therefore, from August, we have systematically changed to a two-shift system.

Regarding the issue of "equipping experienced old technicians to master the iron furnace," our factory has been using old technicians Zhao Lianjia, Xu Chenggui, and Lou Fangzhou, who have 16 or 17 years of ironmaking experience, to master the iron furnace from last year to now. The three-ton iron furnace was originally a blast furnace for heating equipment during the Japanese puppet regime. Because it was completely destroyed, it was changed to a cold blast furnace in May this year. However, a series of problems such as the motor, blower, wind power, wind pressure, wind eye, feeding, milling iron material, and coke composition have not been correctly resolved, so continuous solidification accidents occurred, and no one was responsible. After the deputy director returned to the factory midway from the Shenyang conference, he ordered Deputy Director Zhang Yunxiang, who has the longest metallurgical working age (more than 20 years of ironmaking experience), to take special responsibility for the furnace in response to this phenomenon. From today's point of view, this measure is still necessary.

In mid-June, Workers' Daily reporter Xue wrote an article criticizing our factory for failing to complete the repair and parts task in May. After reading it, we believed that the content of the article did not match the objective facts. Because after the spring safety inspection in May, the old lathes were overhauled once, and the actual number of construction starts in the original mechanical plant was 5,000 per month, while the number of internal repairs accounted for 2,500, accounting for 50% of the production man-hours, thus disrupting the original production plan and making it impossible to complete the repair and parts tasks for external factories. However, the reporter insisted that this was not the reason, but due to the bureaucracy of the leadership. Therefore, we put forward suggestions for revision. However, the reporter insisted on publishing it in the Fushun Workers' Daily, so we had to raise our different opinions to the Municipal Party Committee, because we have no right to suppress the reporter's freedom of speech. Secondly, talking about the issues of "according to the factory's summary speech" and "restricting reporters' interviews," before each monthly work summary, we hold a factory-wide workers' representative meeting or a workshop workers' representative meeting, a factory management committee, and a cadre meeting, where everyone speaks freely and conducts criticism and self-criticism on the monthly production and construction work. The factory then makes a summary based on these meeting records, and then communicates it downwards and reports it to the higher authorities. Since this summary is made by everyone, it is not only the responsibility of the factory director alone, but should be the responsibility of all cadres. The members of the factory management committee, the cadres of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League, must base their internal and external statements on the monthly production tasks on this summary. When reporters come to the factory to understand the situation, the factory has not taken any measures to restrict reporters from talking to workers. I don't know what he based his statement on that the factory restricted reporters' freedom of interview? In July, Comrade Lu Bo, a reporter from the newspaper, criticized our factory's work in his manuscript. Because it concerned the entire factory, we convened an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Factory Management Committee to study it. All the Standing Committee members disagreed with the publication of the manuscript. At the same time, we made it clear to Lu Bo that if he did not want us to be responsible for the manuscript, he had full right to publish it in the newspaper; conversely, if he wanted us to fully accept his criticism of our factory that did not conform to the facts and publish it in the Workers' Daily led by the Fushun Municipal Party Committee, then we would have to raise different opinions to the Municipal Party Committee. This is not the same as suppressing the reporter's freedom of speech.

We sincerely and humbly accept Comrade Lu Bo's spirit of criticism. I am a cadre who has worked in the revolutionary army for a long time, and I lack modern mechanical industrial technology knowledge and management experience. Inevitably, there are serious shortcomings and mistakes in my work. These shortcomings and mistakes cannot be excused because I am not proficient in modern technology. This is a manifestation of not fulfilling my responsibility to the country and the people. I have serious bureaucratic working styles in my leadership work. In the future, I must overcome it with a serious attitude, overcome the current difficulties, and improve my work.

　　抚顺机修厂汪洋厂长
    对鲁渤批评的答复编辑同志：
    我们已读到九月十六日人民园地发表的抚顺工人报记者鲁渤同志的批评信。现根据鲁渤同志所提问题及本厂实际情况答复如下：
    “产品质量不好，产品出厂时也没有经过科学检验，仅凭‘眼力’评定。”本厂确是因为没有理化检验设备，单凭“眼力”与简单的量器检验。本厂在伪满时代是有此种设备的，但后来都被国民党匪帮破坏了。现在欲恢复这个设备，是难于做到的。“给车辆厂制作机车用的自动靴头”，是本厂修复工厂中接到的活。这种东西，按照本厂设备情况，是不能制作的，但因去年抚矿机电工程科李家宾工程师在该项工程命令单上曾批示试作，结果试作出来的产品不能使用。“承做七百五十斤钢锭模子”问题，并不是七百五十斤、而是七百五十公斤的一个钢锭模子。这个工作，一方面因抚顺浑河江桥大检修，交通不便，影响了翻沙用的风砂供应，另一方面因本厂迫切需要解决各厂矿的机械配件，曾有计划地把上半年的铸铁转到矿山机械配件工作中去，因此，上半年铸铁任务虽超过原计划百分之三十三，但钢锭模任务未按计划进行。“制油厂急用的加咸板，三月份交货，但至今还未完成”，并非三月份交货，而是三月份定作，七月份交货。
    “上半年发生机械设备事故七十二次；伤害事故一百六十八次”。这个数字是确实的。其中设备事故较重大者有七次，一般都是由于机械破旧所发生的普通事故。伤害事故中有二十二次，伤者休养了两周以上，一般的多是烫伤，或是擦破皮，受到轻微伤害。我们曾尽力避免这些事故。“五月七日成品车间的电锤坏了，停工二十七天”的问题，是在春季保安大检查以后，领导上有计划地进行定期检修。“三吨铁炉凝固的责任事故，损失达十亿元东北币”。按成本计算，实际上仅损失一亿零七百余万元东北币。
    “缺乏制度，纪律松懈”问题，其原因固然是领导不好，但自去年一月东北企业局接受大小十三个工厂后，工人从一百二十多人增至一千四百多人。当时开动的机械只有两台，而现在竟增到三百多台机械。技术管理人员，来自各个方面，各有一套技术与管理经验。新工友中，农忙时回家种几天地，或搞个小买卖，因此流动性大。这对劳动纪律、技术操作、出勤率等方面，都有影响的。再加以住宅过于分散，使工厂管理与领导感到极大的困难。在短短一年内，要克服劳动纪律松弛的现象，是不容易的。“三吨铁炉凝固事故，领导上至今也未进行追究责任”问题，领导上并非放弃不管，在七月间全厂总结大会上，已对负责人分别进行处分。张副主任、赵班长各予记大过一次，降薪一级。
    “计划不周。检查成品部门，连检查标准和计划都没有。”我们的检查计划和检查标准原是有的，只是缺乏检查工具和具有一定技术素养的技术人员。全厂检查用的卡钳、千分尺……等只有十余件；而检查部门十多个工作人员中，大部分是初学的青年学生。这就不能不使检查工作碰到了困难。“制作链板时把最重要的沾火手续忽视了”。制作链板的任何一个生产程序，我们都是重视的，沾火程序也不会例外。“锻造场房子盖了又拆，拆了又盖。”这是由于本年夏季国家对本厂没有新的投资，将本厂原矿山机械修配厂，改为重型矿山机械制造厂。因此，本年度小型基建计划也不能不随着改变。“小铁道铺了又拆，拆了又铺。”小铁道是轻便铁道，是随着需要随时铺设的。“暖气沟没有等使用就塌倒了。”，暖气沟工程是去年由抚矿工事事务所承做的。该所施工较晚，未等做完即行结冻。而且去年缺乏洋灰，没材料做洋灰板。故盖暖气沟这件工程本厂不能负责。
    “奖惩不明。半年来仅有合理化建议五件。”本厂每月给奖工分平均约有一亿，占车间工资百分之四，并非没奖励。“对工人改进洋镐闷子事，领导上没有给予奖励。”这是因为原洋镐闷子可做三十多个不坏，经杨永润工友改造后，做两、三个就坏了，反而造成费工费料的损失。“罗玉芳提出三班制的具体交接班办法和制度，一个月后还没得到答复。”我们曾接受罗玉芳的意见，于七月一日起实行三班制。但实行起来问题很多，徒工占工人中半数，顶一班干活，对徒工学习、技术操作、机械保养、产品质量等方面都有莫大的不良影响。其次，破旧车床总不间断地运转，严重影响了机械的寿命。所以试行结果，肯定目前在本厂实行三班制，客观条件是不许可的。因此从八月份起，我们有步骤地改为二班制。
    关于“配备有经验的老技工去掌握铁炉”的问题，本厂从去年到现在，都是由有十六七年化铁经验的老技工赵连甲、徐成贵、娄芳洲三同志掌握化铁炉。三吨化铁炉，在伪满时代原是暖风设备的高炉，因遭彻底破坏，本年五月间改为冷风炉，而电动机、吹风机、风力、风压、风眼、对料、铣铁材质、焦炭成份等一系列的问题，皆未得到正确的解决，于是连续发生凝固事故，无人负责。副厂长从沈阳会议中途回厂后，即针对此现象，命令冶金工龄最长（有二十多年化铁经验）的张云相副主任对炉负专责。这种措施，从今天看来，也还是必需的。
    六月中旬工人报记者薛同志写了一篇批评本厂五月份没完成修配任务的稿件，我们阅后认为稿件内容与客观事实不符。因五月份春季保安大检查后，即将那些过于破旧的车床大检修一次，原机械场每月实际动工数五千个，而内修工数占去二千五百个，占生产工数百分之五十，因而打乱了原生产计划，使对外厂修配任务不能完成。而该记者硬说不是这原因，乃是由于领导上的官僚主义。因此，我们提出了修正意见。但该记者一定要在抚顺工人报上发表，我们只好向市委提出我们的不同意见，因为我们没有任何权利压制记者言论的权利。其次，谈到“根据工厂的总结发言”和“限制记者采访”的问题，我们每月在工作总结前，都召开全厂工人代表会议或车间工人代表会议、厂管会、干部会，由大家自由发言，对全月的生产修建工作展开批评与自我批评，厂方则根据这些会议记录作总结，然后向下传达并向上级报告。既然这个总结是大家作出来的，就不仅由厂长一个人负责，应由全体干部负责。而工厂管委会的委员们，党政工团的干部们，对内对外发表有关某月生产任务时，就不能不根据这个总结。记者到工厂了解情况时，厂方并未采取任何限制记者和工人谈话的措施。不知他根据什么说厂方限制记者自由采访？七月份该报记者鲁渤同志批评本厂的工作稿件，因事关全厂，我们曾召集了工管会常委扩大会议来研究，全体常委不同意发表该稿。同时我们向鲁渤明白声明，如果他不要我们对稿负责任的话，他有充分权利在报纸上发表；反之如果他要我们完全接受他对本厂不符事实的批评，在抚顺市委领导的工人报上发表，那我们就必须向市委提出不同的意见。这与压制记者言论自由的行为是不相同的。
    对于鲁渤同志的批评精神，我们是诚恳与虚心接受的。我是长期在革命部队工作的干部，对于现代化机械工业技术知识与管理经验非常缺乏，在工作中难免有严重的缺点和错误。这些缺点与错误，并不能因不精通现代技术而宽恕自己。这是对国家人民未负起责任的表现。我在领导工作上有严重的官僚主义作风，今后必须以严肃的态度克服它，战胜目前的困难，改进工作。
