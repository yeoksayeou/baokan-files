　　Japanese People's Anti-Imperialist Picture Woodcuts Re-exhibited in the Western Suburbs Park of Beijing

　　On July 15th, the 28th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Communist Party, the All-China Federation of Art Workers, in order to express its celebration, began holding the "Japanese People's Anti-Imperialist Struggle Picture Woodcut Exhibition" in Zhongshan Park, Beijing, which was warmly welcomed by workers, soldiers, students, and citizens of the capital. However, because the exhibition time was short, many people did not have time to visit. In order to welcome our first National Day, the Art Association has specially added many new materials and re-exhibited them in the Western Suburbs Park (formerly known as the Zoo) starting from September 30th. All circles are welcome to visit.

　　The exhibits are divided into four parts: pictures, woodcuts, cartoons, and books and periodicals, mainly reflecting the heroic spirit of the Japanese people under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party in launching the anti-imperialist struggle, and exposing the bloody rule of the US imperialists and their running dog, the Yoshida reactionary government.

　　日本人民反帝图片木刻在京西郊公园重新展览
    在七月十五日日本共产党建党二十八周年纪念那一天，中华全国美术工作者协会为了表示庆祝，在北京中山公园开始举行了“日本人民反帝斗争图片木刻展览会”，受到首都工人、士兵、学生和市民们热烈的欢迎。但因举行时间较短，来不及去参观的人非常之多。为了迎接我们第一次国庆的到来，美协特地添加许多新的材料，已从九月三十日起，在西郊公园（旧称万牲园）再度展览，欢迎各界踊跃参观。
    展览品分图片、木刻、漫画和书刊四部分，主要是反映日本人民在日共领导下展开反帝斗争的英勇精神，和暴露美帝及其走狗吉田反动政府的血腥统治的罪恶。
