Additional Levy of Sanitation Fee and Primary Education Fee
Beijing Municipal Government Decides on New Measures

The Beijing Municipal People's Government has recently decided on new measures for the additional levy of sanitation fees and primary education fees in the city, namely: the industrial and commercial tax portion will no longer be additionally levied, but will instead be additionally levied on public utilities. Sanitation fees, primary education fees, etc., are local expenditures for citizens' welfare undertakings and should be raised locally. After the liberation of Beijing, local administrative fees were collected twice in the urban area, but because the old methods were used, the burden was distributed to each household, which was quite unreasonable. As decided by the First Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference, the method of additional levy was adopted to solve this problem, that is, 30 percent was additionally levied on property tax and local tax, and 10 percent was additionally levied on industrial and commercial tax. Now, according to the decision of the Second National Tax Conference, and approved by the Third Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference, in addition to the continued additional levy on property tax and land tax, the additional levy on industrial and commercial tax is stopped, and instead, an additional levy is made on the fees charged by municipal public utilities. The specific method of additional levy has been discussed several times by the Municipal Government and relevant units, and discussed and approved by the Tax Group of the Consultative Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference: In order to take care of the burden on citizens, it has been decided that, except for electric lighting and electric heating, which have recently been adjusted to lower the selling price, and therefore will be additionally charged at a different ratio, other items such as the fares for buses and trams, and the fees for telephone and tap water, will be directly drawn and handed over to the Municipal Treasury for transfer by the respective units according to the charges, and the selling price will not be increased due to this additional levy for the time being. The additional levy ratios for each unit are as follows: (1) 8 percent will be additionally levied on the fare income of trams and buses; (2) 8 percent will be additionally levied on the monthly rental income of telephones; (3) 10 percent will be additionally levied on the water fee income of tap water; (4) 6 percent will be additionally levied on the electricity fee income of electric heating and electric lighting (street light fees are willing to continue to add 5 percent along with the electric light fee, which will remain the same).

　　附征清洁卫生费和小学教育费
    京市府决定新办法
    京市人民政府顷决定本市清洁卫生费和小学教育费新的附征办法，即：工商业税部分不再附加，而改由公用事业附征。清洁卫生费小学教育费等系属市民福利事业之地方性开支，应由地方筹措。京市解放后，曾在城区征收过两次地方行政事业费，因系沿用过去旧办法，逐户摊派，颇不合理。经本市第二届第一次各界人民代表会议决，改用附征方法解决，即在房产税、地方税中附征百分之三十，在工商业税中附征百分之十。现根据全国第二届税务会议决定，并经本市第二届第三次各界人民代表会议通过，除房产税、地产税仍旧附征外，工商业税附征停止，改由本市公用事业收费内附征。具体附征办法业经市府与各有关单位数次磋商，并经市各界人民代表会议协商委员会税收小组讨论、通过：为照顾市民负担起见，决定除电光、电热因最近已调整降低售价，故按收费另外比例附加外，其它如汽车、电车的票价和电话、自来水费，由各该单位按收费直接提成解交市金库转账，暂不因此项附加而增高售价。各单位附征比率如下：（一）电车、公共汽车票价收入各附征百分之八；（二）电话按月租收入附征百分之八；（三）自来水按水费收入附征百分之十；（四）电热电光按电费收入各附征百分之六（街灯费愿随电光费附加百分之五，仍照旧）。（京市新闻处）
