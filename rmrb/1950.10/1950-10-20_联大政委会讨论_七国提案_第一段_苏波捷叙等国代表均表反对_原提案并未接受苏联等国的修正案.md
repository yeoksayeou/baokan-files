Xinhua News Agency, New York, 18th: A comprehensive TASS dispatch reports that after the United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee concluded the general debate on the "United Action for Peace" proposal put forward by the United States and six other countries on the 13th, it reconvened on October 16th to begin discussing the proposal section by section.

At the previous meeting, the proposing countries, including the United States, originally stated that they would absorb the Chilean proposal and the revised opinions and suggestions made by all parties during the general discussion before the meeting and revise the original proposal during the adjournment. However, compared with the original proposal, the revised proposal only has some unimportant modifications, and the basic provisions of the original proposal remain unchanged. As everyone knows, it is these provisions aimed at weakening the powers of the Security Council that brutally violate the UN Charter.

The meeting first decided to discuss the substantive part of the seven-nation proposal section by section, and finally discuss the preamble.

Then, the discussion began on the first paragraph of the effective part of the seven-nation revised proposal, which stipulates the convening of a special session of the General Assembly. Although US Representative Dulles said that the revised proposal accepted the criticisms from the Israeli and Pakistani delegations and part of the Soviet delegation's amendments, the first paragraph of the revised proposal, like the original proposal, still contained the following provisions: a special session of the General Assembly can be convened based on a "resolution" supported by any seven members of the Security Council; a special session of the General Assembly can be convened within twenty-four hours after the notice is issued; the General Assembly may make recommendations on collective actions, including the use of armed forces.

Ukrainian Representative Baranovsky said in his speech that the Ukrainian delegation did not oppose the convening of a special session of the General Assembly, but opposed the convening of a special session based on the decision of any seven members of the Security Council, because this violates the UN Charter. Baranovsky also opposed the provision that a special session could be convened within twenty-four hours after the notice was issued. He pointed out that governments must have a certain amount of time to study the agenda before the meeting can make appropriate and effective decisions.

Israeli Representative Eban, in his speech, once again expressed doubt about the legality of the provision that a special session of the General Assembly could be convened based on the decision of any seven members of the Security Council.

Polish Representative Wierblowski pointed out that the provision in the seven-nation proposal authorizing the General Assembly to make recommendations on collective actions, including the use of armed forces, violates the Charter and usurps the powers of the Security Council. This attempt is a conspiracy to undermine the Security Council.

Czechoslovak Representative Hachdu declared that this paragraph of the proposal could only be accepted after the Soviet Union's amendments were passed.

Syrian Representative El-Gouri once again urged the proposing countries of the seven-nation proposal to withdraw the provision that a special session could be convened based on the decision of any seven members of the Security Council, because this provision is inconsistent with the Charter and infringes on the Security Council's right to interpret the Charter.

Soviet Representative Vyshinsky spoke. He supported the Syrian representative's reasons, believing that no one could determine the procedures for the Security Council. He said that if the majority of countries believe that the provisions on convening a special session of the General Assembly should be revised, then a special session should be convened in accordance with the Charter to amend the Charter.

Vyshinsky then refuted the absurd argument that convening a special session is a "procedural matter," saying that the issue of holding a special session involves accusations against one or several countries. This is entirely a substantive issue. Accusations may be purely a provocative act to stir up the flames of war hysteria; any delegation must substantively consider this issue before deciding whether to convene a special session. Vyshinsky pointed out that in some cases, this decision may also be procedural, but whether it is procedural should be decided by the Security Council.

Vyshinsky once again firmly opposed the provision that a special session could be convened within twenty-four hours after the notice was issued. He warned that this situation can only lead to rash actions, only lead to a kind of "machine gun diplomacy," and at this time, in order to avoid serious mistakes, very careful and very calm consideration is needed.

Vyshinsky pointed out that the Charter stipulates that the General Assembly can only make recommendations for "peaceful settlement" of any situation that endangers friendly relations between countries. The so-called recommendations on "actions to ensure peace" that the United States' followers claim the General Assembly can make in accordance with the Charter are unfounded sophistry.

Representatives from Britain, France, and Uruguay defended the seven-nation proposal at the meeting. Representatives from Yugoslavia, Pakistan, and Cuba expressed support for the seven-nation proposal. The Australian representative fiercely attacked the Soviet Union's proposal.

### 联大政委会讨论“七国提案”第一段  苏波捷叙等国代表均表反对  原提案并未接受苏联等国的修正案

　　联大政委会讨论“七国提案”第一段
    苏波捷叙等国代表均表反对
    原提案并未接受苏联等国的修正案
    【新华社十八日讯】综合塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会于十三日结束对美国等七国所提“保障和平的联合行动”案的一般辩论后，于十月十六日复会，开始逐段讨论该提案。
    美国等提案国在上次会议上，原称将在会前吸收智利提案及一般讨论时各方所发表的修正意见和建议，在休会期间修正原提案。但是，修正后的提案与原提案相比，仅有一些不重要的修改，原提案的基本规定仍保留未动。众所周知，正是这些旨在削弱安理会职权的规定，粗暴地违反了联合国宪章。
    会议首先决定先将七国提案的实效部分逐段加以讨论，最后再讨论序言。
    接着便开始讨论七国修正提案实效部分中关于规定召开联大特别会议的第一段。美国代表杜勒斯虽然说：修正后的提案接受了以色列和巴基斯坦代表团的批评以及苏联代表团的修正案的一部分。但是，修正后的提案第一段，和原提案一样，仍包含了下列规定：根据安全理事会任何七个理事国所支持的“决议”即可召开联大特别会议；发出通知后二十四小时内即可召开大会特别会议；大会得在包括使用武装部队在内的集体行动方面提出建议。
    乌克兰代表巴拉诺夫斯基发言说：乌克兰代表团并不反对大会召开特别会议，但是反对安理会任何七个理事国的决定即可召开特别会议，因为这是违反联合国宪章的。巴拉诺夫斯基并反对通知发出后二十四小时内即可召开特别会议的规定，他指出会前各国政府必须有一定时间来研究议程，然后会议才能作出适当而有效的决定。
    以色列代表依班发言时，再度对安理会任何七个理事国的决定即可召开特别会议的规定是否合法一点，表示怀疑。
    波兰代表威尔勃洛夫斯基指出：七国提案授权大会得就包括使用武装部队在内的集体行动方面提出建议一节，是违犯宪章的，是篡夺安理会的职权。这种企图就是阴谋破坏安理会。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表哈奇杜宣称：只有通过苏联的修正案后，才能接受提案的这一段。
    叙利亚代表埃尔——古里再度敦促七国提案的提案国撤消以安理会中任何七个理事国的决定即可召开特别会议的规定，因为这项规定与宪章不符，并且侵犯了安理会解释宪章的权利。
    苏联代表维辛斯基发言。他支持叙利亚代表的理由，认为没有谁能够为安理会确定程序。他说，如果大多数国家认为应该修改有关召开大会特别会议的规定，那末应该根据宪章召开特别会议来修改宪章。
    维辛斯基继而驳斥召开特别会议是“程序问题”的荒谬论据说：举行特别会议的问题会涉及对一个或几个国家的控诉。这完完全全是一个实质问题。控诉可能纯粹是为了煽起战争歇斯底里的火焰的一种挑拨行为；任何代表团在决定是否要召开特别会议前，都必须从实质上考虑这个问题。维辛斯基指出：在若干场合下，这种决定也可能是程序性的，但是究竟是不是程序性的问题应该由安理会来决定。
    维辛斯基再度坚决反对发出通知后二十四小时内即可召开特别会议的规定。他警告说：这种情况只能造成轻举妄动，只能导致一种“机关枪式的外交”，而在目前这种时候，为了避免严重错误，需要非常慎重和非常冷静的考虑。
    维辛斯基指出：宪章规定大会仅能就危害国各友好关系的任何局势提出“和平解决”的建议。美国的追随者所谓大会根据宪章可作出“保障和平的行动”方面的建议，是毫无根据的诡辩。
    英国、法国及乌拉圭代表在会上为七国提案辩解。南斯拉夫、巴基斯坦、古巴代表表示支持七国提案。澳大利亚代表狂烈地攻击苏联的提案。
