　　Bring the Instructions of the Leaders Back to the Village to Encourage the Villagers to Improve Production
　　Zhang Shuyi, Agricultural Model of North China Region
　　In the past, I was a beggar. This time, I came to Beijing to attend a meeting and was very happy. I also saw Chairman Mao, and I was so happy that I couldn't speak. We will also participate in the National Day celebration. If it weren't for the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, there would be no days for the poor to turn over, and there would be no chance to come to Beijing. It's really something I couldn't even dream of. After I go back from the meeting, I will definitely resolutely talk to the villagers about the spirit of the conference and the care and instructions of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and other leaders for us, and tell everyone to work hard. I must improve the production of my village and my township, support the People's Liberation Army in eliminating the reactionaries, and defeat the provocative acts of aggression by American imperialism.

　　要把各首长指示带回村去勉励老乡把生产搞得更好
    华北区农业模范  张树义
    过去我是个要饭的，这次到北京来开会，非常痛快，又看见了毛主席，更痛快的说不出话来，我们还要参加国庆纪念日。要不是毛主席和共产党的领导，那能有穷人翻身的日子，那能到北京来，真是作梦也想不到。我开会回去后一定决心好好将大会的精神和毛主席、朱总司令和各首长对我们的照顾和指示给老乡们谈谈，叫大家都好好干起来，一定要把我村的，我乡的生产搞好，支援人民解放军消灭反动派，打败美帝国主义侵略的挑衅行为。
