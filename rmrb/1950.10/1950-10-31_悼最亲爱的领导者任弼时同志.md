　　In Memory of Comrade Ren Bishi, Our Dearest Leader
    Zhang Ziyi
    When I heard the heartbreaking news of Comrade Ren Bishi's passing in Beijing amidst the sorrowful music on the radio, grief and sorrow seized me. This great people's warrior, politician, and organizer of the working class has bid us farewell forever. We grieve the loss of one of our dearest leaders, a best teacher and friend. His admirable image, his great contributions to the Party, the people, and the working class, will forever be etched in our memories.
    Recalling the years of the internal war, during the most arduous years of the war, during the five "encirclement and suppression" campaigns organized by imperialism and the Kuomintang against the Red Army, Comrade Ren Bishi was dispatched by the Party Central Committee to the Xianggan Border Region—the revolutionary base area centered on Jinggang Mountain—in May 1933, to serve as the Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and Political Commissar of the Military Region. From the first day I met him, this dearest leader, with astonishing perseverance, organized, inspired, and led the Red Army troops and the people of the revolutionary base areas in a resolute struggle against the enemy. He possessed an exceptionally calm mind, never impatient, never flustered, and had a high degree of principle, being good at conducting pertinent, profound, and yet benevolent criticism of various incorrect tendencies within the Party. He possessed boundless revolutionary enthusiasm and a spirit of seeking truth from facts, never knowing fatigue, working day and night. It was this dearest leader who pointed out the direction for us, increased our strength, and strengthened our confidence in victory. From the summer of 1933 to the autumn of 1934, the Red Army in the Xianggan Border Region, under his leadership, inflicted devastating blows on the enemy, preserved its own strength, and organized the Sixth Red Army Corps. In August 1934, under the leadership of Comrade Ren Bishi, Chairman of the Military and Political Committee of the Sixth Army Corps, the Xianggan Red Army was ordered to break through the encirclement and advance into Xiang, Gui, and Qian, shocking the enemy. The enemy forces in Hunan and Guangxi provinces, under the command of Chiang Kai-shek, launched a blocking, pursuit, and interception campaign against our army. We were often surrounded by enemy forces on all four sides, with enemy planes constantly bombing and strafing overhead, and enemy troops constantly encircling and attacking on the ground. Under the leadership of Comrade Bishi, we repelled the enemy's attacks each time and broke through their encirclement. We often victoriously extricated ourselves from seemingly hopeless and dangerous situations, bravely advancing towards our destination. During these days of arduous struggle, Comrade Bishi was with us, inspiring us to advance bravely and skillfully defeat our enemies. After three months of arduous marching and fighting, without a single day of rest, we finally reached eastern Guizhou in October of the same year and victoriously joined forces with the Second Red Army Corps led by He Long and Guan Xiangying.
    During the period of leading the Second Front Army, Comrade Bishi, together with He and Guan, resolutely and correctly implemented Chairman Mao's military thought and strategic policy, launching large-scale mobile warfare in the vast areas south of the Yangtze River in the Xiang, E, Chuan, and Qian border regions, and expanding the revolutionary base areas. In less than a year, they completely annihilated the enemy's 41st, 48th, and 85th Divisions, and even more enemy troops suffered devastating blows. In the winter of 1935, Chiang Kai-shek concentrated his main force to encircle and attack our army. We broke through the encirclement and began the Long March when the enemy forces, which outnumbered us by more than ten times, began their encirclement, advancing into central Hunan, fighting fiercely in Zhijiang, sweeping across Guizhou, fighting in Yunnan, crossing the perilous Jinsha River, and entering Xikang, where we victoriously joined forces with the Fourth Front Army. Under the wise leadership of Comrade Ren Bishi, He, and Guan, this iron torrent was invincible, making the seemingly powerful enemy at the time tremble with fear.
    After the Second and Fourth Front Armies joined forces in Ganzi in June 1936, Comrade Bishi led us in the struggle against the traitor Zhang Guotao. At that time, in order to split the Party and the Red Army, Zhang Guotao insisted on convening a cadre meeting of the Second and Fourth Front Armies to pass anti-Party resolutions. Comrade Bishi immediately warned Zhang Guotao, saying: "All commanders and fighters of the Second Front Army have the highest faith in Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. Cadres of the Second Front Army never blindly obey. If you force them to oppose the Party, they will turn against you; they do not recognize you." Therefore, the traitor's conspiracy ultimately failed, and the First, Second, and Fourth Front Armies were finally able to victoriously join forces in Shaanxi and Gansu.
    Comrade Bishi, one of Chairman Mao's closest comrades-in-arms, possessed the foresight of a leader, a broad revolutionary mind, Bolshevik principles, and Chairman Mao's ideological style. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, he cultivated and educated us and the younger generation, making us stronger and more courageous, fighting all the way to final victory.
    Now, this great people's warrior and politician, our most respected leader, has bid us farewell forever. This is a great loss to our Party and the Chinese people. We must transform our grief into strength, learn from Comrade Bishi's fighting spirit and fearless spirit, closely unite around Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and fight to the end to defeat the aggression of American imperialism and defend the independence and prosperity of our motherland. Comrade Bishi! Rest in peace! As your successors, we will surely learn to fight as you did. Let the enemies tremble before the iron People's Liberation Army—the people's army that has been politically nurtured by you! The revolutionary cause for which you devoted your thirty years of life to fighting will surely achieve final victory.
                             October 29, 1950, in Chongqing

　　悼最亲爱的领导者任弼时同志
    张子意
    当我在收音机的哀乐声中，听到了任弼时同志在京病逝的噩耗后，沉痛和悲哀攫住了我。这位伟大的人民战士，工人阶级的政治家和组织家已和我们永别了。我们悲痛我们失去了一位最亲爱的领导者，一位最好的教师和朋友。他令人敬爱的形象，他对党、对人民、对工人阶级的伟大的功绩，将永远铭刻在我们的记忆中。
    回忆在内战时期，在战争最艰苦的岁月，在帝国主义、国民党组织对红军的五次“围剿”的时候，任弼时同志于一九三三年五月被党中央派到湘赣边区——以井岗山为中心的革命根据地，担任省委书记和军区政治委员。从我见到他的第一天起，这位最亲爱的领导者，就是以惊人的毅力，组织、鼓舞和领导红军部队和革命根据地的人民，同敌人进行坚决的斗争。他具有异常冷静的头脑，任何时候都不急躁，任何时候也不张惶，他具有高度的原则性，对党内各种不正确倾向，善于进行中肯的、深刻的、同时又是与人为善的批评。他具有无限的革命热情与求实精神，从来不知道疲倦，夜以继日地工作着。就是这位最亲爱的领导者给我们指出方向，增加了我们的力量，加强了我们对于胜利的信心。从一九三三年夏到一九三四年秋，湘赣边区的红军，在他的领导下，给了敌人以歼灭性的打击，保存了自己的有生力量并组织了红军第六军团。一九三四年八月，在六军团军政委员会主席任弼时同志的领导下，湘赣红军奉命突围，挺进湘桂黔，震惊了敌人，湘南和广西等省的敌军，在蒋介石的指挥下，举行了对我军的堵击、追击和截击。我们常常是处在前后左右四面的敌军的包围中，头上不断有敌机轰炸扫射，地面不断有敌军包围袭击。在弼时同志的领导下，我们每次都打退了敌人的攻击，冲破了敌人的包围。常常从看来似乎是绝境的危急情况中，胜利地摆脱了敌人，勇敢地朝着我们的目的地前进。在这些艰难困苦如火如荼的斗争日子里，弼时同志和我们在一块，鼓舞着我们英勇地前进，巧妙地战胜了我们的敌人。经过了三个月艰苦的行军，作战，没有一天休息，直到同年十月，才到达黔东和贺龙、关向应领导的红二军团胜利地会师。
    在领导红二方面军时期，弼时同志和贺、关一道，坚决地、正确地实现了毛主席的军事思想和战略方针，在长江以南湘鄂川黔边广大地区，展开了大规模的运动战，扩大了革命根据地。在不到一年的时间内，即全歼敌军四十一、四十八、八十五等师，受歼灭性打击的敌军更多。一九三五年冬，蒋介石集中了他的主力向我军进行围攻。我们在数量上大于我军十几倍的敌军开始围攻时突围长征，挺进湘中，激战芷江，横扫贵州，转战云南，渡天险金沙江，进入西康，与红四方面军胜利会师。在任弼时同志与贺、关的英明领导下，这一支铁流，所向无敌，使当时表面上似乎是很强大的敌人胆战心寒。
    一九三六年六月红二、四方面军在甘孜会师后，弼时同志领导我们进行了反对叛徒张国焘的斗争。当时张国焘为了分裂党和红军，坚持召集二、四方面军的干部大会，通过反党的决议。弼时同志即警告张国焘说：“红二方面军全体指战员对毛主席和党中央有最高的信仰。二方面军干部从来不盲目服从。你如果要强迫他们反党，那他们就会要闹翻脸，他们是不认识你的。”因此，叛徒的阴谋，终不得逞，而一、二、四方面军终于能在陕甘胜利地会师。
    毛主席的最亲近的战友之一弼时同志，具有领导者的远见，宽宏的革命胸怀，布尔什维克的原则性与毛主席的思想作风。他在毛泽东思想的指导下，培养和教育了我们及青年的一代，使我们更坚强，更勇敢起来，一直战斗到最后的胜利。
    现在这一位伟大的人民战士和政治家，我们最敬爱的领导者，和我们永别了。这是我们党和中国人民的很大的损失。我们要化悲痛为力量，学习弼时同志的战斗精神与大无畏的精神，紧密地团结在毛主席和党中央的周围，为战胜美帝国主义的侵略，保卫我们祖国的独立与繁荣而奋斗到底。弼时同志！安息吧！作为你的后继者的我们，一定能学会和你一样地战斗。让敌人在铁的人民解放军——受了你的政治陶养的人民军队面前发抖吧！你毕三十年的生命为之奋斗的革命事业，一定要得到最后的胜利。
                             一九五○年十月二十九日于重庆
