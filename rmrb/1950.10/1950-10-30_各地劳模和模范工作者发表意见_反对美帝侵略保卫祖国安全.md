Labor Models and Model Workers Across the Country Express Opinions
    Oppose U.S. Imperialist Aggression and Defend National Security

    Resolutely defend national security and extinguish the fire of U.S. imperialist aggression.
    Industrial Labor Model Zhao Zhankui
    The flames of the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Korea are increasingly spreading to our borders, directly threatening the security of our people. On this issue, the Chinese people absolutely cannot remain indifferent, and the Chinese people will never allow imperialists to run rampant on our motherland's territory again. In order to safeguard our motherland's territory and maintain peace in Asia, all Chinese people should mobilize together to extinguish the flames of the war of aggression. I solemnly declare: We, the working class, vow to fight to the end to defend our motherland!

    The Weapons in the Hands of the Aggressors Are Not Reliable
    Industrial Labor Model Yu Songru
    In the old society, we were deceived and oppressed by imperialists and bureaucratic capitalists for many years, living a life of selling our souls; only under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, were we able to drive away the U.S. imperialists and defeat the reactionaries, and only then did we gain true freedom and have the opportunity to study politics and develop production. But the U.S. imperialists dared to use their old tricks, armed intervention in our liberation of Taiwan, and launched a war of aggression against Korea. Recently, they have intensified their actions, repeatedly sending planes to violate our airspace, killing and injuring our people, fully exposing their hideous faces. Although they are clamoring wildly, the people of the world have long been disgusted with wars of aggression. From the universality of the signature campaign to defend world peace and the large number of signatures, we understand the greatness of the forces of peace. However, the U.S. imperialists are妄想to suppress the truth with force, and妄想to fool innocent people into being cannon fodder and massacring people. We absolutely cannot tolerate these crimes. Premier Zhou Enlai said: "The Chinese people love peace, but in order to defend peace, they have never been and will never be afraid to resist wars of aggression." We Chinese people have undergone the test of great battles. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have achieved unprecedented unity and friendship, and have demonstrated unprecedented enthusiasm for labor. We overcame the floods of last year and this year, and production competitions are surging across the country. Here, I want to warn the U.S. imperialists: The result of World War I was the emergence of the Soviet Union, the light of the people, and the result of World War II was the emergence of people's democratic countries such as Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Albania, Korea, and Germany, as well as our People's Republic of China, and the people of the world are moving towards peace and democracy. If you dare to launch a war, you are undoubtedly seeking your own demise. Don't think that you have many weapons and underestimate the power of the people. You should know that the weapons in the hands of the aggressors are not reliable! The fact that you previously aided Chiang Kai-shek in launching the Chinese civil war and failed is the most realistic illustration.

    The U.S. Imperialist War in Korea Has Approached Our Border; We Cannot Ignore It.
    Industrial Labor Model Li Jinquan
    U.S. imperialism launched a bloody war of aggression against the Korean people, and now it is approaching our border, seriously threatening our security. Before this, it had armed and occupied our Taiwan and repeatedly sent planes to violate our northeast airspace, strafing our people. We can no longer ignore it. I resolutely protest the U.S. imperialist aggression. The workers in my factory are also extremely angry. Now we are stepping up production and work to protest the U.S. imperialist expansion of the war of aggression with practical actions.

    We Must Strengthen National Defense and Economic Strength to Resist Wars of Aggression!
    Industrial Labor Model Zhang Deqing
    U.S. imperialism is invading our neighbor Korea and expanding the war of aggression, forcing its puppet states to send troops. Our people's democratic countries must not allow the imperialists to run rampant. We should support Korea with practical actions. We should call on the people of the U.S. imperialist puppet states and their colonial countries to promote the spirit of internationalism and resolutely not become tools for imperialist aggression against Korea, so as to avoid the imperialists strengthening their shackles and aggression against themselves.

    In view of the fact that U.S. imperialism is expanding the war of aggression, in order to ensure the safety of our country's production and the lives and property of the people, I believe that our country's industrial production should rapidly strengthen security and guarantee continued production. We must strengthen our national defense and economic strength to resist wars of aggression.

    The Chinese People Must Support the Korean People and Extinguish the Flames of U.S. Imperialist Aggression.
    Model Worker of the Armed Forces Li Lanting
    The U.S. imperialist aggression against Korea is actually an aggression against the people of Asia and the Chinese people, thus destroying peace in the East and the world. This blood debt must be repaid by the U.S. imperialists! Our Foreign Minister Zhou has repeatedly issued solemn warnings to the aggressors. However, the U.S. imperialists have intensified their actions, stealing the name of the United Nations and determined to be enemies with the people of the world, frantically destroying peaceful towns in Korea, massacring the Korean people, expanding the war of aggression against Korea, and armed aggression against our territory Taiwan. Planes invading Korea violated our airspace, killing and injuring our people, and extending the flames of the war of aggression to our motherland's border. We, the people of Asia, are the masters of Asia. We, the Chinese people, have the responsibility, the right, and the power to support the Korean people and extinguish this criminal flame of aggression. We resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement and resolutely implement Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order issued at the National Day rally, vowing to use our sincere love for the motherland, promote the great spirit of revolutionary heroism, not to avoid difficulties and dangers, not to be afraid of sacrifice, and loyally dedicate everything we have to rescue work. We will forever stand together with the heroes who defend the motherland and the people of the whole country, and fight for defending national defense, consolidating victory, opposing aggression, and defending lasting world peace!

　　各地劳模和模范工作者发表意见
    反对美帝侵略保卫祖国安全
    坚决保卫祖国安全，扑灭美帝侵略火线。
    工业劳动模范  赵占魁
    美帝侵朝战争的火焰，已日益延烧到我国边境，直接威胁着我国人民的安全。对此问题，中国人民绝对不能置之不理，中国人民决不允许帝国主义者再来我们祖国领土内横行。为了维护我们祖国的领土，为了维护亚洲的和平，全中国人民应一致动员起来，扑灭侵略战争的火焰。我郑重表示：我们工人阶级誓为保卫祖国而奋斗到底！
    侵略者手中的武器并不足恃
    工业劳动模范  于松如
    我们在旧社会里，被帝国主义者、官僚资本家们欺骗、压迫了多少年，过了多少年出卖灵魂的生活；好容易在共产党和伟大领袖毛主席英明领导下，把美帝赶走，把反动派打垮了，我们才得到了真正的自由，才有了学习政治、发展生产的机会。但美帝竟敢仍施其惯技，武装干涉我们解放台湾，发动侵略朝鲜战争，近来更变本加厉，屡次派飞机犯我领空，杀伤我人民，充分暴露出它的狰狞面貌。尽管它在狂妄叫嚣，但现在全世界人民，早已厌恶侵略战争，从保卫世界和平签名运动的普遍和签名人数的广大来看，使我们了解到和平力量的伟大，而美帝竟妄想以武力压服真理，妄想愚弄无辜人民给它做炮灰，屠杀人民。我们决不能容忍它这些罪行。周恩来总理说：“中国人民热爱和平，但是为了保卫和平，从不也永不害怕反抗侵略战争。”我们中国人民，经过了伟大战斗的考验。在毛主席领导下，中国人民做到了从未有过的团结和友爱，发挥了从未有过的劳动热忱。我们战胜了去年和今年的水灾，全国各地生产竞赛风起云涌。在这里，我要警告美帝：第一次世界大战的结果，产生了人民之光的苏联，第二次世界大战的结果，产生了捷、波、罗、保、匈、阿、朝、德等人民民主国家及我们中华人民共和国，并且全世界的人民都在向着和平、民主的道路上迈进。你如敢发动战争，无疑地是自寻灭亡。你不要认为你有多少的武器，而过低估计人民的力量，你应知道：侵略者手中的武器是不足恃的！你从前援助蒋匪发动中国内战失败的事实，就是最现实的说明。
    美帝侵朝战火已经逼近我国边境，我们不能置之不理。
    工业劳动模范  李金泉
    美帝国主义发动了侵略朝鲜人民的血腥战争，现在又逼近我国边境，严重地威胁着我国的安全。这以前，它曾武装侵占我国的台湾，又数次派遣飞机犯我东北领空，扫射我国人民。我们再也不能置之不理了。我坚决抗议美帝国主义的侵略行为。我厂职工也都愤怒万分。现在我们正加紧生产，加紧工作，以实际行动抗议美帝扩大侵略战争。
    要加强国防力量与经济力量，以反抗侵略战争！
    工业劳动模范  张德庆
    美帝侵略我邻邦朝鲜，且扩大侵略战争，迫令其仆从国家出兵，我人民民主国家决不能听任帝国主义者们放肆横行。我们应当以实际行动援助朝鲜。我们应当号召美帝仆从国家及其殖民地国家的人民，发扬国际主义精神，坚决不做帝国主义侵略朝鲜的工具，以免帝国主义加强对自己的束缚与侵略。
    鉴于美帝扩大侵略战争的事实，为了保障我国生产事业及人民生命财产的安全，我认为我国工业生产事业，应当迅速地加强安全保卫工作，保证继续生产。我们要加强我们的国防力量与经济力量，以反抗侵略战争。
    中国人民要支援朝鲜人民，扑灭美帝侵略火焰。
    部队模范工作者  李蓝丁
    美帝对朝鲜的侵略，实际上就是对亚洲人民与中国人民的侵略，因而也破坏了东方和世界和平。这笔血债，必须要美帝来偿还！我周外长屡次向侵略者发出严正警告。但美帝却变本加厉地盗用联合国名义决心与全世界人民为敌，疯狂地毁灭朝鲜和平城镇，屠杀朝鲜人民，扩大侵朝战争，并武装侵略我国领土台湾，侵朝飞机犯我领空，杀伤我国人民，把侵略战争的火焰延烧到我祖国边境。我亚洲人民是亚洲的主人。我们中国人民有责任有权利有力量来支援朝鲜人民，扑灭这种罪恶的侵略火焰。我们坚决拥护周外长的庄严声明，坚决执行朱总司令在国庆节大会上发布的命令，誓以热爱祖国的赤诚，发扬伟大的革命英雄主义精神，不避艰险，不怕牺牲，为救护工作忠诚地献出我们的一切。并与保卫祖国的英雄们及全国人民永远站在一起，为保卫国防，巩固胜利，反对侵略，保卫世界持久和平而奋斗！
