　　Linyi area, Shandong Province, enjoyed relatively stable grain prices before the end of August. Wheat and millet prices in Linyi City, Tancheng, Taierzhuang, Qingkou and other places remained at around 600 yuan per jin for a long time. After the new grain was put on the market, the prices of coarse grains generally fell in various places. In the inland areas of Cangshan County, the price of sorghum once fell below 300 yuan per jin, and twelve jin of sorghum could only be exchanged for one large ruler of foreign cloth. Farmers generally reflected: "Cloth is expensive and grain is cheap; we have food but no clothes." Since September, under the correct leadership of the higher authorities, state-owned specialized companies have been purchasing large quantities of grain at increased prices and promoting the sales of industrial products at stable prices; at the same time, they have encouraged private merchants to transport grain and cloth to expand the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and prevent the continued widening of the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products. After the above measures, in just one month, significant results have been achieved in various places. The average price of wheat and sorghum has risen by about 100 yuan per jin, while the prices of cloth and yarn have remained stable, the price of oil has fallen, and the price of beans has remained stable. On August 23, the prices in Linyi City were 650 yuan per jin for wheat, 400 yuan per jin for sorghum, 850 yuan per jin for soybeans, 4,100 yuan per jin for raw oil, 230,000 yuan per bolt for white fine cloth, and 154,000 yuan per piece for 20-count foreign yarn. By September 21, the price of wheat had risen to 700 yuan per jin, the price of sorghum had risen to 520 yuan per jin, the price of soybeans (650 yuan) and raw oil (3,600 yuan) had gradually fallen, and the price of foreign cloth (238,000 yuan) and foreign yarn (158,000 yuan) had slightly increased.

　　国营公司大量收购下  临沂地区粮价停止下跌
    【本报讯】山东临沂地区在八月底以前，粮价比较稳定。临沂城、郯城、台儿庄、青口等地的小麦、小米，都长时间停留在每斤六百元上下。新粮上市后，各地粗粮价格普遍下跌。苍山县内地每斤高粱曾落至三百元以下，十二斤高粱才能换一大尺洋布。农民普遍反映：“布贵粮贱，有吃的无穿的”。九月份以来，各国营专业公司在上级正确领导下，提价大量收购粮食，稳价推销工业产品；同时鼓励私商贩运粮布，扩大城乡物资交流，防止工农业产品剪刀差额的继续扩大。经过以上措施，到现在不过一个月，各地都有了比较显著的效果。小麦、高粱平均每斤上升一百元左右，布、纱保持稳定，油价下跌，豆价平稳。临沂城八月二十三日每斤小麦六百五十元，高粱四百元，黄豆八百五十元，生油四千一百元，白细布每匹二十三万元，二十支洋纱每块十五万四千元，到九月二十一日，小麦每斤升至七百元，高粱每斤升至五百二十元，黄豆（六百五十元）、生油（三千六百元）逐渐下落，洋布（二十三万八千元）、洋纱（十五万八千元）微升。（尚铎）
