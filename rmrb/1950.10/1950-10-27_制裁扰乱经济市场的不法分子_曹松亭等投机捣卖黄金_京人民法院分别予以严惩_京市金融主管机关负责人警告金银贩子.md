　　Sanction Illegal Elements Disrupting the Economic Market
　　Cao Songting and Others Speculate and Hoard Gold, Beijing People's Court Imposes Severe Punishments Respectively
　　Responsible Person of Beijing Municipal Financial Authority Warns Gold and Silver Dealers
　　[Beijing News Agency] The Beijing Municipal People's Government recently uncovered three criminals involved in hoarding and speculating gold and silver, including Cao Songting, who have been sentenced to imprisonment by the Municipal People's Court. Cao Songting was originally the manager of the Lao Feng Xiang Gold Store. After the store closed down in August of last year, he used the name of a cloth merchant to secretly hoard and speculate in gold with Zhang Yufeng, Du Jinsheng, and others, specializing in transporting gold from Beijing and Tianjin to Shanghai and Hong Kong. Zhang and Du were responsible for transportation, while Cao Songting was responsible for purchasing. In early July of this year, Zhang Yufeng and Du Jinsheng came to Beijing from Shanghai, carrying drafts and RMB 31.88 million, to discuss purchasing gold with Cao Songting. This was discovered by the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau, which arrested the three on the spot and sent them to the Municipal People's Court for trial. After investigation by the court, it was confirmed that the criminals illegally hoarded and speculated gold, harming the interests of the people and violating government decrees. According to the provisions of the Common Program: "The buying and selling of gold and silver shall be managed by the state bank," and "Those who engage in financial speculation and damage the state's financial undertakings shall be severely punished," the criminals were punished accordingly. Cao Songting was sentenced to two years in prison and fined RMB 15 million; Zhang Yufeng was sentenced to one year and six months in prison; Du Jinsheng was sentenced to one year in prison. The illegally hoarded gold, cash, and evidentiary weighing scales were all confiscated.
　　[Further News] A responsible person of the Municipal Financial Authority recently issued a statement regarding the People's Court's sentencing of Cao Songting and others for illegally hoarding and speculating gold, stating: "The buying and selling of gold and silver shall be managed by the state bank," and "Those who engage in financial speculation and damage the state's financial undertakings shall be severely punished" are explicitly stipulated in the Common Program. Over the past year, the People's Government has implemented the policies and decrees on gold and silver management using a combination of investigation and education, achieving great success. This has not only cracked down on gold and silver speculators but also prevented gold and silver from affecting prices, protecting the interests of the people, and transforming many speculators into legitimate industries. However, Cao Songting and others still hoarded and speculated gold, seeking illegal profits. The government will severely punish such gold and silver dealers who disrupt the economic market and harm the interests of the people.

    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民政府近查获曹松亭等三名捣卖金银犯，已由市人民法院分别判处徒刑。曹松亭原为老凤祥金店经理，自去年八月该店歇业后，即以布业行商为名，暗中与张玉峰、杜金生等共同捣卖黄金，专自京、津贩运黄金至上海、香港。张、杜二人来往运送，曹松亭负责购买。本年七月初，张玉峰、杜金生二人由上海来京共携带汇票与人民币三千一百八十八万元，到曹松亭处商量购买黄金。事为公安外二分局查悉，遂将三人当场捕获，送市人民法院审理。经法院调查属实，以该犯等违法捣卖黄金，危害了人民的利益，触犯了政府的法令，根据共同纲领的规定：“金银的买卖应由国家银行经理”，“凡进行金融投机、破坏国家金融事业者，应受严厉制裁”，故对各犯分别予以惩处。曹松亭处徒刑二年，并科罚金一千五百万元；张玉峰处徒刑一年又六个月；杜金生处徒刑一年。违法捣卖之黄金、现款及证物戥子等物，均予没收。
    【又讯】本市金融主管机关负责人，顷就人民法院判处曹松亭等违法捣卖黄金案，发表谈话称：“金银的买卖应由国家银行经理”，“凡进行金融投机、破坏国家金融事业者，应受严厉制裁”是共同纲领所明文规定的。一年来，人民政府用查缉与教育相结合的方法，贯彻执行了金银管理的政策与法令，收到很大的成绩，不但打击了金银投机分子，并使金银不再影响物价，保障了人民的利益，也改造了很多的投机分子转向正当行业。而曹松亭等，竟仍然捣卖黄金，非法图利，对于这种扰乱经济市场，危害人民利益的金银贩子，政府一定要给予严厉的制裁。
