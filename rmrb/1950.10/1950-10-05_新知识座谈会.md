　　New Knowledge Seminar
    The New Knowledge Seminar, sponsored by the Beijing Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, used to be held every Saturday. This time, because the venue is occupied by another gathering this Saturday, it is specially moved to Thursday (October 5th) at 7:00 PM, still at the Xiehe Auditorium. This time, Mr. Ding Zan, an expert in mental health, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, will be the speaker on: "How Do We Strive for World Peace?" The association has temporary admission tickets available. Those who wish to attend the lecture can bring a letter to the association to obtain them. (Zhen)
