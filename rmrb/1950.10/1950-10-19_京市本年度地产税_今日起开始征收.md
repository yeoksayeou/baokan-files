Beijing Municipality's Real Estate Tax for This Year Begins Collection Today

　　The Beijing Municipal 1950 Real Estate Tax will begin collection today (the 19th). Tax payment notices are being issued successively by the Tax Bureau to each household. The deadline for payment is set at fifteen days, with a surcharge for late payment. The rice price will be uniformly calculated according to the central government's stipulated fiscal revenue and expenditure rice price of 1,055 yuan per jin. The additional local health and education fee remains at 30 percent. In addition to complying with the Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Committee's decision to adjust taxes, abolish progressive taxation, and uniformly levy at a rate of 1.5 percent, this year's real estate tax will also be based on the Beijing Municipal Land Administration Bureau's newly adjusted and assessed 18-grade land prices within the city, calculating the tax amount payable per mu for each grade as the standard for this year's real estate tax collection. The highest is the first grade, with a tax of 975 jin of millet per mu; the lowest is the eighteenth grade, with a tax of 4.5 jin of millet per mu. The division of grades is determined according to the degree of prosperity and traffic conditions of the area. The new land price is also determined based on the difference in land prices of the eighteen grades, derived from actual transaction prices, which has greatly corrected the unreasonable phenomenon of grade differences in the past.

　　京市本年度地产税  今日起开始征收
    京市一九五○年度地产税于今（十九）日起开征。各户缴款通知书正由税务局陆续发出中，缴款期限规定为十五天，逾期加课滞纳金。米价则统一照中央规定之财政收支米价每斤一○五五元计算，附加地方卫生教育费仍为百分之三十。本年度地产税，除遵照政务院财经委员会调整税收决定，取消累进，统一按百分之一点五比例征收外，并依地政局重新调整评定之京市城区以内十八级土地等级地价，分别核出每级每亩应纳税额，作为本年度地产税征收标准。最高为第一级，每亩税额小米九百七十五斤；最低为十八级，每亩税额小米四斤半。等级的划分，系依照地区繁荣程度及交通条件核定，新地价亦系根据十八级之差级地价，从实际买卖价格中核定者，已大大纠正过去级差不合理现象。
