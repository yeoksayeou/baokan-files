Lạng Sơn city is the capital of Lạng Sơn province in northern Vietnam. It occupies a strategically very important position. It is the largest city along the famous Route 4, which runs along the Sino-Vietnamese border from Móng Cái to Tiên Yên, Tràng Định, Lạng Sơn, Thất Khê, Đông Khê, and Cao Bằng. A railway line starting from Lạng Sơn, before the war, connected with Hanoi and Saigon south of Hanoi, parallel to Route 1. This Hanoi-Lạng Sơn railway was built for strategic purposes by the French when they first annexed Vietnam because Lạng Sơn was not only an important fortress but also the gateway from China to Hanoi. The railway and highway from Lạng Sơn to Hanoi are now useless due to sabotage by Vietnamese guerrillas.

In the modern history of Vietnam, the strategic position of Lạng Sơn is very important. In 1885, when the French war of aggression against Vietnam began, they suffered a major defeat in Lạng Sơn. This defeat caused the French government's policy of aggression against Vietnam to encounter serious protests and opposition from the French people, and as a result, the Ferry cabinet was forced to resign. More recently, in 1940, when the Japanese imperialists launched a war to seize Indochina from the French colonialists, the French colonialists deployed resistance in Lạng Sơn, but were completely defeated in the first battle. The fall of Lạng Sơn led the French colonial authorities to shamelessly surrender to Japanese fascism.

Later, the people of Lạng Sơn province, unwilling to be slaves, unanimously armed themselves and resolutely fought against the dual enslavement of Japanese and French imperialism. At the end of 1940, the people of the Bắc Sơn area of Lạng Sơn province staged an uprising, marking the revolutionary spirit of the people of Lạng Sơn. Later, the Việt Minh led the Vietnamese people in a struggle to overthrow French rule, and Lạng Sơn became one of the first three provinces in northern Vietnam to be liberated: Cao Bằng, Bắc Kạn, and Lạng Sơn.

After the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1945, the Republic and France signed an agreement on March 6, 1946, in which France still focused its attention on Lạng Sơn. According to the March 6, 1946 agreement, France could station troops in Lạng Sơn city. Since then, the French colonialists have perfidiously carried out a series of provocations throughout Vietnam. Large-scale provocations began in November 1946, when they attacked the peaceful residents of Lạng Sơn and Hải Phòng. It was these events that started the nationwide war of resistance from December 1946 to the present.

After that, the French greatly strengthened their defensive forces in Lạng Sơn, built military airfields, and dispatched reinforcements. Lạng Sơn immediately became a French army base blocking the northeastern front of the Vietnamese people. The strategic position of Lạng Sơn has thus become even more important. In the French military distribution, Lạng Sơn is a major stronghold on the parallelogram including Lạng Sơn, Móng Cái, Hải Phòng, and Hanoi. Lạng Sơn controls the highways leading to the Hòn Gai coal mines located in the parallelogram, as well as the highways to the northern coast, Hải Phòng, and the capital Hanoi. The French colonialists had engaged in political conspiracies to establish a "Nùng Autonomous Territory" in Lạng Sơn in an attempt to weaken the resistance movement in Lạng Sơn province. But these despicable plans have completely failed.

Military failures have been a considerable blow to France. French military convoys traveling between Lạng Sơn and Móng Cái, or between Lạng Sơn and Cao Bằng, have been attacked more than once by the Vietnamese armed forces. At the same time, some small strongholds around Lạng Sơn have been gradually eliminated. Earlier this year, when "Route 4" was cut off by the Vietnamese army and the surrounding strongholds fell into the hands of the Vietnamese army one after another, Lạng Sơn had virtually become an isolated island.

In less than a month, the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army liberated six French military strongholds located in North Vietnam. Under the powerful offensive of the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army, the French army was forced to withdraw from the important town of Lạng Sơn, which is the result of the growing strength and development of the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces. There is no doubt that after the French army withdraws from Lạng Sơn, the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army will continue to achieve significant victories.

　　越北重镇谅山介绍
    谅山市是越南北部谅山省的省会。在战略上占着非常重要的地位。它是沿着中越边境的芒街至仙安、亭立、谅山、七溪、东溪和高平的著名的第四号公路上最大的城市。以谅山为起点的一条铁路线，在抗战前，与河内和河内以南的西贡相连接，与第一号公路平行。这一条河（内）谅（山）铁路是早先法国吞并越南时为了战略目的而修建的。因为谅山不仅是一个重要的要塞，并且是从中国通往河内的大门。从谅山到河内的铁路和公路，现在由于越南游击队的破坏已变得无用了。
    在越南的近代史中，谅山的战略地位是十分重要的。一八八五年，当法国侵越战争开始的时候，他们曾在谅山吃过一次大败仗。这一个败仗，使得法国政府的侵越政策在法国人民面前遭到严重的抗议和反对，因而忧勒佛里内阁被迫辞职。最近，一九四○年，当日本帝国主义者对法国殖民者发动侵夺印度支那战争的时候，法国殖民者曾在谅山布置抵抗，但在头一仗就完全溃败了。谅山的陷落使得法国殖民当局厚颜无耻的向日本法西斯投降。
    后来，谅山省的人民不愿做奴隶，一致武装起来向日法帝国主义的双重奴役坚决进行斗争。一九四○年年底，谅山省北山地区的人民举行暴动，标志着谅山人民的革命精神。后来，越盟领导越南人民进行推翻法国统治的斗争，谅山即成为越北首先解放的高平、北?和谅山三个省份之一。
    一九四五年，越南民主共和国成立后，一九四六年三月六日共和国和法国签订了一个协定，法国仍然将注意力集中在谅山。根据一九四六年三月六日的协定，法国可以在谅山城驻军。自那时起，法殖民者背信弃义地在全越各地进行了一系列的挑衅。大规模的挑衅始于一九四六年十一月，他们向谅山和海防的和平居民进攻。正是由于这些事件，才开始了一九四六年十二月迄今的全国性的抗战。
    其后，法国大大增强了他们在谅山的防御力量，修建军用飞机场，并派遣援军。谅山立刻变成了封锁越南人民的东北前线的法国军队根据地。谅山的战略地位就因此而显得更为重要。在法国的军事分布上，谅山是包括谅山、芒街、海防和河内的平行四边形上的一个主要据点。谅山控制通往位在平行四边形里的鸿街煤矿的公路以及到北部海岸，到海防和到首都河内的公路。法国殖民者曾施展政治阴谋，在谅山建立“侬邦”以图削弱谅山省内的抵抗运动。但是这些卑鄙的计划已完全失败。
    军事方面的失败对于法国是不小的打击。往来于谅山和芒街间，或谅山与高平间的法国军事护运队，不只一次地为越南武装部队所袭击，与此同时，谅山周围的一些小据点也逐渐被拔除了。在今年初当“第四号公路”被越南军队切断，周围的据点相继地落到越南军队手里时，谅山实际上已经变成一个孤岛。
    越南人民解放军在不到一个月的时期内，解放了位在北越的六个法军据点。法军在越南人民解放军强大攻势之下，被迫撤出重镇谅山，这是越南人民武装力量日益壮大发展的结果。毫无疑义，在法军自谅山撤退以后，越南人民解放军将继续取得重大的胜利。
