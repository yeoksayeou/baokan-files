On the Rectification Movement in North China
Zhang Panshi, Head of the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee

I. Scope, Methods, and Preliminary Experience

Since mid-June, party organizations and cadres at and above the county level in North China have enthusiastically responded to the CPC Central Committee's instructions regarding the Rectification Movement. After formulating plans and carrying out mobilization, most areas began rectification study in early July. To date, according to incomplete statistics, in Chahar Province alone, more than 12,000 cadres have participated in rectification meetings at all levels; in Shanxi, the second phase of rectification classes organized by various prefectural committees has concentrated more than 8,000 cadres for rectification; in Hebei, most county-level and above organs are undergoing rectification, with more than 5,000 people in directly affiliated provincial rectification classes. Nearly 100,000 cadres across the region have been drawn into this movement, accounting for about one-third of the total number of cadres in the region, and most are key personnel at all levels. This rectification was carried out "in close combination with various work tasks rather than in separation," completely in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, amidst leading the autumn harvest, resisting disasters of rain, waterlogging, and hail, and other extremely tense and busy work. The rectification methods adopted in various places generally involved first convening meetings of cadres at and above the county level by provincial and municipal leaders to convey Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session, arrange autumn and winter work, discuss rectification plans, and conduct preliminary work inspections to cultivate rectification backbones. Then, these backbones would return to their units to gain experience and gradually expand the movement. This is, in effect, a general review of all work in North China in 1950, and also a large-scale study movement for all cadres.

Rectification is an extremely complex ideological struggle, and whether the Rectification Movement can be led well is itself the best test of whether bureaucratism and commandism can be overcome. For more than two months, thanks to the correct instructions of the CPC Central Committee, the full control of the provincial and municipal party committees, and the increasing awareness of the importance of rectification by cadres at all levels after participating in the rectification, the Rectification Movement in the North China region has progressed smoothly on the whole. Of course, in order to carry out the Rectification Movement correctly, it is necessary to constantly overcome various deviations. From the beginning of formulating the plan, we emphasized seeking truth from facts and opposed the dogmatism of copying superior instructions without regard to the specific conditions of one's own unit. In the rectification mobilization, we emphasized the positive significance of rectification, using concrete examples to correct the erroneous understanding of "nothing to rectify" and the concerns about rectification; emphasized the responsibility of the leaders, emphasizing the rectification of leading cadres first. In studying documents, we emphasized linking theory with practice, opposing aimlessly poring over words and phrases and drilling into terminology, and opposing spending too much time studying documents without being willing to delve into inspections. After entering the work inspection phase, we emphasized summarizing work, opposing simply inspecting personal life trivia; emphasizing inspecting specific work, opposing aimless rambling thoughts; emphasizing self-criticism from top to bottom first, but also never letting the leadership first draw a fixed circle for the comrades below to forcibly fit into, the so-called looking at the wind direction, "giving whatever is asked for," but after the leadership's self-criticism and enlightenment, fully developing democracy, letting the lower levels offer opinions according to their own actual situations, emphasizing focusing on rectifying Party cadres, while also absorbing non-Party cadres to participate in offering opinions, widely collecting opinions from inside and outside the Party through symposiums and representative meetings, looking at what the bureaucratism and commandism of this unit looks like from a large number of common problems, and then concentrating on the main problems to carry out criticism and self-criticism. When conducting criticism and self-criticism, we opposed the mechanical and coercive method of "struggle without thought" in ideological struggle, and also opposed the tendency of actually canceling criticism under the pretext of "gentle breeze and fine rain," but rather analyzed criticism to distinguish right from wrong and responsibility, pursued the causes of errors, and formulated improvement methods. This is the preliminary experience of the Rectification Movement in North China to date.

II. Manifestations of Bureaucratism and Commandism

In the repeated top-down and bottom-up inspection work, a considerable number of problems were discovered in various places, among which a large number of prevalent and common problems can be summarized as follows:

From the leadership's point of view, the first is that there are many instructions, many meetings, and many requests for reports or forms from below, but less inspection or summarization, and red tape is very serious. According to statistics from the Shanxi Provincial Government in May: an average of 130 documents were received every day, of which 6% came from the Central Government, 10% from the Special Commissioner's Office, 32% from the counties, 50% from Taiyuan City, and others from various provinces and cities. An average of 390 documents were issued every day, of which very few were policy guidance documents. The high-level organs' cumbersome office procedures meant that a document had to go through 16 to 19 procedures, taking about 10 days to half a month to issue. Some organs lived next door and had telephones, but general problems were not solved face-to-face, but had to go through official letters and countersigning, which greatly delayed matters. There were many meetings above, and the lower levels couldn't bear it even more. At least one of the main cadres in Yuci's First District was regularly taking turns attending meetings in the county. According to a survey in Wuxiang in April: the district held a meeting every ten days, each lasting three days, and one day was spent writing reports. The Dongcun District cadres held 20 meetings of all sizes every ten days. The Chahar Province Guangling County Party Committee held an average of one and a half meetings every day. Most of the lower-level cadres were illiterate and feared filling out forms the most. According to statistics from a village in Fenxi, Shanxi: from January to April, 39 kinds of forms were received, each filled out in seven copies, requiring two copies to be filled out every day. Some forms were completely incomprehensible and could not be filled out. District cadres in Pinglu said: "Provincial level is scientific, special commissioner level is standardized, county level is systematic, district level is a mess, and the village is a pot of soup." In Ding County, 20 groups of people went to Zhaicheng Village in one month to collect materials, and the village cadres reflected that "it's really impossible to be a model."

In situations where tasks are large and time is urgent, leading organs sometimes distribute work downwards indiscriminately, regardless of the importance and urgency. Some do not take into account the strength of the cadres and the awareness of the masses. For example, Chahar Province required 100% seed soaking this spring, and one prefectural committee felt that the requirement was too high, and the provincial party committee criticized the prefectural committee for "insufficient construction spirit." Therefore, in this rectification, the cadres said that the leadership was "fond of greatness and eager for success." Some major tasks are of course non-negotiable, but the problem is that the specific leadership of the higher-level organs to the lower levels is poor, and work tasks and policies are sometimes not clearly explained, satisfying with completing the task, but not asking about the methods. For example, Chahar Province put forward the slogan of one chicken per person, which may not be too high if averaged across the entire province, but the problem is big if the lower-level cadres think that everyone must have one chicken, regardless of who they are. Another example is that Handan Prefecture planned to dig 10,000 new wells, which was originally a year-long plan, but due to the leadership's emphasis on getting things done early rather than late, it ordered the completion before wheat harvesting. Some counties raised difficulties, and the prefectural leadership, although acknowledging this was a fact, still insisted on the original proposal, saying that it was "afraid of loosening the grip." There were also cases of increasing the number of tasks at each level and advancing the time layer by layer for fear of not completing the task, and not paying attention to the methods of completing the task. Leading organs often satisfied with achievements, so many mistakes are repeated again and again in the work.

Secondly, there are many cases of lower-level cadres adopting rude and rough attitudes towards the masses in their work in order to complete the task. For example, in many villages in Chahar Province, people were stationed to collect farming tools and force seed soaking. Another example is Tong County and Shulu County forcing people to shovel seedlings to plant cotton. It was obviously past the time for planting cotton, and the farmers said: "Cotton blossoms in Xiaoman, don't go home." But in order to complete the task, the cadres insisted: "Cotton blossoms in Xiaoman, cart them away." The county magistrate of Fenyang went to the countryside to inspect tree planting, and the village chief forced the farmers to plant trees overnight. A civil affairs assistant in a district of Huai Ren detained 17 people in one month, and the district chief praised him for being able to complete the task. In order to complete 90% of the autumn plowing, some districts in Chahar Province forced the masses to cut the crops and plow the land before they were ripe, and the frozen land had to be plowed, and even the windy slopes that could not be plowed had to be plowed. Some comrades said that it is easy to make the mistake of relying on coercion and command when asking the masses for things, and it is not easy to make this mistake when giving things to the masses, but some of the above things are giving things to the masses. Some comrades said that there are fewer cases of beating, scolding, and detaining the masses, and even fewer cases of beating and scolding the masses for personal matters. This is true, but it should be understood that even one case of beating and scolding the masses is wrong. Some cadres, although not beating or scolding the masses, are still essentially coercion and command, so the masses said: "No matter how soft the cadres' methods are, you have to follow him." This refers to this kind of commandism that is soft on the surface but hard in reality. Can coercion and command complete the task? It is said that there is such a story: When the district cadres mobilized for autumn plowing, they said to plow twice, the village cadres said to plow three times, and the masses promised to plow four times, because "if you promise more, you can go to bed earlier and use less oil. Saying is their saying, plowing is our plowing, otherwise we have to have a meeting." This situation is one of the important sources of false reports. It can be seen that using coercion and command may not be able to complete the task, but instead cause the phenomenon of the lower levels deceiving the upper levels, which is worthy of vigilance.

III. Responsibility and Causes of Errors

Because leading organs at all levels have two aspects: leadership and being led, leading lower-level work and executing upper-level tasks, it is difficult to distinguish the responsibility for errors, and it is difficult to say that it is solely the responsibility of one aspect. But generally speaking, high-level leading organs, due to many meetings and red tape, become busy, chaotic, and slow, putting themselves in a passive position, and inevitably putting the lower levels in the same state. Although errors are frequently reviewed, damage to state property or violations of policy still occur from time to time, because when the east side is blocked, loopholes appear on the west side. For example, the Civil Affairs Department of Chahar Province received reports from four villages in Chahan that the disaster situation had stopped developing, and immediately issued instructions to stop issuing relief grain throughout the province, resulting in the starvation of disaster victims. Another example is that some organs send people to investigate below and issue many investigation forms when they feel the need for work, but after receiving the materials, they often do not have time to study them, or do not look at them at all. According to the self-criticism of the Tangshan Prefectural Committee Office: last year, when planting wheat, the prefectural committee sent hundreds of people to each county to investigate the disaster situation from house to house, but after returning, the materials were not studied and were filed, and the comprehensive report of each county in May was not even looked at and was filed. The leading organs are too busy with red tape to understand the situation below well, and cannot listen to the opinions from below well, so the arrangements are inevitably subjective, and they cannot do much specific inspection and assistance, sometimes directly causing commandism. In this situation, some cadres with impure thoughts take the opportunity to force and command the masses under the pretext of heavy tasks, and some become passive and "lie down" and do nothing.

Regarding the phenomenon of leading organs being busy, chaotic, and slow, the comrades below have repeatedly reflected on it in the past year, and the leaders themselves also feel deeply distressed. This spring, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee issued the promise of "accurate, rapid, serious, and consistent" at the meeting of party member cadres in the province and city, the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee had regulations on simplifying meetings, and the Hebei Provincial Party Committee had regulations on reducing forms, but so far the actual results have not been great. Due to the need to carry out large-scale national construction, due to the need to fight against domestic and foreign reactionaries, and due to the need to overcome backward technology and natural disasters, the tasks in the future are still heavy and numerous. Therefore, necessary meetings still need to be held with preparation, and forms that need to be and can be filled out still need to be issued, and some tasks are objectively required to be completed within a time limit, otherwise the masses will suffer even greater losses. Therefore, it must be recognized that the future is still busy, but being busy to the point of chaos is a defect in the working method (that is, in the ideological method), and the basic way to overcome this weakness is still how to improve the level of political thought and improve the working method. At present, the most important thing for leading organs is how to arrange their own work and the work of the lower levels according to the new situation and tasks, distinguishing the importance and urgency, and centering on the center and step by step, turning from passive to active. Explaining the tasks, policies, and methods to the cadres and the masses is a fundamental method of promoting work, and it must not be ignored because of being busy. At the same time, it is also necessary to inspect in a timely manner and be good at listening to the situation and opinions from below. As for the specific improvement methods and systems, this should be decided separately according to the conditions of each unit.

Is the commandism error committed by cadres in their work entirely the responsibility of the leading organs? No, it is not. Of course, the bureaucratic error of the leading organs should bear some direct responsibility for the commandism error of the lower-level cadres. In addition, generally speaking, the leading organs should bear some responsibility for the inadequate education of the lower-level cadres' mistakes. In the past year or two, due to the national victory, many old cadres have been transferred, and the policy level and cultural level of the newly promoted cadres are low, and their work experience is also less, these are all facts. But as a Communist Party member or a staff member of the People's Government, as long as things happen that treat the masses in a rude and rough way, they must bear full responsibility themselves, and should not make any excuses to the superiors or objective conditions. The fact is that some comrades feel that they have merit, and they feel that they are doing revolutionary work, so a kind of privilege ideology grows, thinking that offending the masses is nothing. This kind of complacency and privilege ideology is developing among some cadres after the national victory. Some cadres are unwilling to rely on the working class in factories and enterprises; nor do they rely on the peasants in the countryside; some cadres are satisfied with their existing experience in their work, lack initiative and creativity; they look down on the intellectuals who have newly joined the work ideologically, and are vulgar enough to compare their status and enjoyment with non-Party members; and some cadres have embarked on the road of degeneration, they force the masses at will when they can arbitrarily do as they please, and embezzle and enjoy themselves, and when they cannot achieve this goal, they run away and go home to do their own housework, thinking that the revolution has been "successful" and that doing it again is "losing money." Although this is a very small number among our cadres, it is a serious phenomenon and should arouse the vigilance of all party members in North China! Without overcoming the meritorious service mentality and privilege ideology, we will never be able to overcome commandism and bureaucratism, nor can we overcome the danger of degeneration. Therefore, the current serious task of the North China Party organization is to first thoroughly oppose the meritorious service mentality and privilege ideology; secondly, to strengthen the education of the mass line for those comrades who are essentially good but weak in ability and lack of methods, and to stipulate a system and fully utilize the representative meeting to implement mass supervision. To prevent the development of bureaucratism and commandism, as for those elements who have already shown a tendency to degenerate politically, the Party still has the responsibility today to first use education to save them, but if they still do not correct themselves, the Party will never allow them to remain in the Party.

IV. Developing the Results of Rectification

From the progress of the Rectification Movement in North China, except for a few organs that have ended, and the two cities of Beijing and Tianjin and the counties in each special zone in the plains that are just beginning or have just begun, the vast majority of units are carrying out inspection work. If the basic link of this Rectification Movement, inspection work, is done well, it can not only improve nearly 100,000 cadres by one step, but also lay a good foundation for the continued rectification of two-thirds of the cadres in the entire region, and will also have a great impact on the improvement of future work. That is to say, the Rectification Movement in the North China region is at a most critical stage. At present, in addition to continuing to pay attention to deeply excavating problems in the inspection work, it is also necessary to analyze the problems that have been discovered. If this pile of problems that have been discovered is not studied and analyzed (if it cannot be analyzed, the documents should continue to be read to improve one's ability to analyze and criticize), and the internal connections and essence of these problems are not found out, and various phenomena are simply labeled with some ism or other, then an effective way to overcome them fundamentally cannot be found, and at best, a few empty slogans can be shouted, saying how determined we are in the future, but this still cannot solve the problem in the end.

In short, the party committees at all levels in North China must first rectify the leadership and rectify the cadres well in this stage. After the rectification, they must seriously formulate new systems, consolidate the achievements of the rectification, and carry out universal rectification among grassroots party members this winter and next spring, so that all party members in North China can improve ideologically by one step. Great new tasks are testing us, and we must achieve victory!

　　关于华北整风运动
    中共中央华北局宣传部部长  张磐石
    一、规模、方法和初步经验
    自六月中旬以来，华北党的县级以上机关和干部，热烈地响应了中共中央关于整风运动的指示。经过订定计划和酝酿动员，大部地区于七月初开始整风学习。到目前为止，据不完全统计：察省仅参加各级整风会议的干部即有一万二千余人，山西各地委二期整风班集中整风的干部达八千余人，河北县以上机关大部均在整风，省直属整风班有五千余人。全区卷入这一运动的干部近十万人，约达全区干部总数的三分之一，且大部是各级骨干。这次整风是在领导秋收、抵抗雨水虫雹的灾害和其他极紧张忙碌的工作当中，完全按照毛主席指示的“在和各项工作任务密切相结合而不是相分离的条件下”进行的。各地采取的整风方法，一般是先由省市领导上召开县级以上干部会议，传达毛主席三中全会报告，布置秋冬工作，讨论整风计划，同时初步检查工作，借以培养整风骨干，然后由这些骨干回去在本单位取得经验再逐渐开展。这实际上是对华北一九五○年各项工作的一个总检阅，也是全体干部的一个大规模的学习运动。
    整风是一个极其复杂的思想斗争，能否把整风运动领导的好，其本身就是一个能否克服官僚主义与命令主义的最好考验。两个多月来，由于中共中央的正确指示，由于各省市党委的全力掌握，也由于各级干部在参加整风后愈加认识到整风的重要，华北全区整风运动的进行基本上是顺利的。当然，为了正确地进行整风运动，必须不断地克服各种偏向。从订计划开始，我们就强调了实事求是，反对了不根据自己单位的具体情况照抄上级指示的公式主义。在整风动员中我们强调了整风的积极意义，用具体例证纠正了“无啥可整”的错误认识和害怕整风的顾虑；强调首长负责，强调先是整领导干部。在学习文件中强调联系实际，反对无目的地啃字句、钻名词，反对用过长的时间学习文件而不肯下水检查工作。进入检查工作后，强调总结工作，反对单纯检查个人生活琐事；强调检查具体工作，反对无边际地漫谈感想；强调首先自上而下地检讨，但也绝不是领导上先画个固定的圈子让下面同志硬往上套，即所谓看风色办事，“要啥有啥”，而是在领导上检讨启发后，充分发扬民主，让下级根据自己的实际情况来提意见，强调重点整党内干部，同时吸收党外干部参加提意见，经过座谈会、各界代表会，广泛收集党内外意见，从大量的普遍存在的问题中，看本单位的官僚主义和命令主义是个什么像貌，然后再集中主要问题，开展批评与自我批评。在进行批评与自我批评时，一面反对思想斗争中的“有斗争无思想”的机械强制办法，同时也反对借口“和风细雨”实际上取消批评的偏向，而是经过分析批评来分清是非责任，追求错误原因，订出改进办法。这就是华北整风运动迄今为止的初步经验。
    二、官僚主义与命令主义的表现形式
    在从上而下又从下而上的反复检查工作中，各地发现的问题相当不少，其中大量存在而带有普遍性的，可以概括为以下几点：
    从领导上来看，首先是指示多，会议多，往下要报告或发表格多，而检查或总结则较少，文牍主义很严重。山西省府五月份统计：平均每天收文一百三十件，其中中央来的占百分之六，专署来的百分之十，各县来的百分之三十二，太原市的百分之五十，还有各省市来的。发文每天平均三百九十件，其中政策指导性的文件极少。高级机关办公手续之繁，一个文件要经十六至十九道手续，约十天到半月才能发出。有些机关隔壁对门居住且有电话，一般问题不当面解决，也要通过公函，会签，误事很大。上面会多，下面更受不了，榆次一区的主要干部，经常至少有一人轮流在县里开会。武乡四月份调查：区里每十天开一次会，每次三天，写报告一天。东村区干十天开大小会二十次。察省广灵县委平均每天开一次半会。下边干部多不识字，最怕填表，山西汾西一个村统计：一月至四月收到表格三十九种，每种填七份，每天需填两份。有的表格根本看不懂无法填。平陆区干部说：“省级科学化，专级正规化，县级制度化，区级一盆浆糊，村是一锅汤。”定县翟城村一个月内有二十起人前往搜集材料，村干部反映“真模范不起”。
    在任务大、时间急的情况下，领导机关有时是不分轻重缓急，平均地往下布置工作。有些是不顾及干部力量和群众觉悟。如察省今春要求百分之百浸种，一个地委认为要求太高，省委就批评地委“建设气魄不足”。所以这次整风中，干部说领导上是“好大喜功”。有些重大任务当然是非做不可，问题在于上级机关对下级的具体领导差，工作任务和政策有时交待不清，满足于完成任务，而不问方式方法。例如察省提出一人一鸡的口号，如以全察省平均而论，可能并不为过高，但下边干部以为不论张三李四必须一人一鸡，问题就大了。又如邯郸专区计划打新井一万眼，本是全年计划，由于领导上强调赶早不赶晚，责令麦前完成，某些县份提出困难，专区领导上虽承认这是事实，但仍坚持原议，据说是“怕松了气”。还有怕完不成任务，逐级加大任务数字，层层提早时间，至于完成任务的方式方法则不注意，领导机关常常满足于成绩，因而有不少的错误在工作中再三地重复。
    其次，下面干部为了完成任务在工作中采取蛮横粗暴的态度对待群众的事也是不少的。例如察省不少村庄站岗收耧强迫浸种。又如通县、束鹿强迫铲禾苗种棉，明明过了种棉时间，农民说：“小满花，不回家。”干部为了完成任务，却硬说是：“小满花，大车拉。”汾阳县长下乡检查植树，村长逼着农民连夜栽。怀仁一个区民政助理员一个月打押了十七个人，区长还表扬他能完成任务。察省为了完成百分之九十的秋耕，有的区庄稼还没熟就强迫群众割了耕地，地已冻了还得耕，不能耕的风坡地也得耕。有的同志说是向群众要东西容易犯依靠强迫命令行事的错误，给群众东西就不容易犯这种错误，但上面一些事情却是给群众东西的。有的同志说是打骂扣押群众的事情少了，为着个人私事打骂群众的事更少了，这是事实，但应该懂得打骂群众的事那怕有一件，也是不对的。有的干部对群众虽然不打不骂，但实质上仍然是强迫命令，所以群众说：“不管干部的办法多软，但是非依他不行。”这就是指的这种表面上软实际上硬的命令主义。强迫命令是否就能完成任务呢？据说有这样的故事：区干部动员秋耕时说耕两遍，村干说耕三遍，群众答应耕四遍，因为“多答应点，可以早睡觉，少熬油。说是他说，耕是咱耕，不然还得开会。”这种情形，就是假报告的重要来源之一。可见用强迫命令的办法，未必能完成任务，反而造成下面瞒哄上面的现象，这是值得警惕的。
    三、错误的责任和原因
    由于各级领导机关都有其领导与被领导、领导下级工作与执行上级任务的两方面，因此错误的责任很难分清，很难说单由那一方面负责。但一般地说来，高级领导机关由于会议多、文牍繁，形成忙、乱、慢，使自己陷于被动，也必然使下级陷于同样状态。虽然经常检讨错误，但损害国家财产或违犯政策的情形却仍然时有发生，原因是堵住东边，西边又出漏洞。例如察省民政厅得到察南四个村灾情停止发展的报告，即发出全省停发救济粮的指示，以致发生了饿死灾民的情事。又例如有些机关在感觉工作需要时就派人到下面去调查，发出许多调查表，但得到材料，又往往不暇研究，或者根本不看。据唐山地委办公室检讨：去年种麦时，地委曾派出百数十人，至各县逐户调查灾情，但回来后，材料未加研究即归档案，对各县五月份综合报告，也未看就归了档。领导机关忙于文牍不能很好地了解下情，又不能很好地听取下面意见，布置自不免主观，加以不能多做具体的检查和帮助，有时就直接地造成命令主义。在这种情形下，有些思想不纯的干部，即借口任务重而对群众强迫命令，有的就消极起来，“躺倒”不干。
    关于领导机关忙、乱、慢的现象，一年来，下面同志均屡有反映，领导者自己亦深以为苦。今春山西省委曾在省市党员干部会上发出“准确、迅速、严肃、一致”的诺言，天津市委曾有精简会议的规定，河北省委曾规定减少表格，但迄今事实上收效不大。由于要进行大规模的国家建设，由于要和国内外反动派作斗争，由于要克服落后的技术和天灾，今后的任务仍是重大且多的。因此，必要的会议仍要有准备地开，需要与可能填的表格仍是要发的，而且有些任务是客观上要求我们必须限期完成，否则群众会受更大的损失。因之，必须认识今后仍是忙的，但忙而至于乱则是工作方法上（亦即思想方法上）有缺点，而克服此种弱点的基本的办法仍在于如何提高政治思想水平、改进工作方法。目前领导机关最主要的是如何根据新的形势与任务，分别轻重缓急，有中心有步骤地安排自己的工作和下级的工作，从被动转入主动。把任务、政策与方法向干部和群众交待清楚，这是推进工作的一种根本方法，千万不要因为忙就忽略了这一点。同时还必须及时检查，善于听取下面的情况和意见。至于具体的改进办法和制度，这要根据各单位的条件分别决定。
    干部在工作中所犯的命令主义错误，是否完全要由领导机关负责呢？不，不是这样。当然，领导机关的官僚主义错误，对于下边干部的命令主义错误要负一部分直接的责任。此外，一般地说，下边干部犯错误，领导机关多少要负教育不周之责。一两年来，由于全国的胜利，老干部抽调的很多，新提拔的干部政策水平和文化水平都低，工作经验也较少，这些都是事实。但作为一个共产党员或人民政府的工作人员来说，只要发生了用蛮横粗暴的办法对待群众的事情，就要自己负完全的责任，而不应向上级或客观条件作任何推诿。事实是有些同志觉着自己有功，而且觉得自己是做革命工作，因而滋长着一种特权思想，认为得罪群众也没有什么。这种居功自傲情绪和特权思想在全国胜利后是在一部分干部中发展着。有些干部在工厂企业中不愿意依靠工人阶级；在农村中也不依靠农民；有些干部在工作中满足于已有的经验，缺乏积极性与创造性；思想上看不起新参加工作的知识分子，庸俗到和党外人士比地位、比享受；还有些干部走上了蜕化堕落的道路，他们在得以任意横行时，就随便强迫群众，贪污享受，而在不能达此目的时，就逃跑回家，搞自己的家务，认为革命已经“成功”，再干就是“赔本”。这在我们的干部中虽是极少数，但它是一种严重的现象，应引起华北全体党员的警惕！不克服功臣情绪和特权思想，决不能克服命令主义和官僚主义，也不能克服蜕化堕落的危险。因此，华北党组织当前的严重任务，就是首先彻底反对功臣情绪和特权思想；其次是对那些本质上好而能力弱、办法少的同志加强群众路线的教育，并规定制度，充分运用代表会实行群众的监督。以防止官僚主义命令主义的发展，至于那些政治上已有蜕化倾向的分子，党今天仍然有责任首先用教育的方法来挽救他们，但是如果他们仍然不改正，党就决不能允许他们留在党内。
    四、发展整风成果
    从华北整风运动的进度上看，除较少数机关已经结束，京津两市和平原各专区各县正在开始或开始不久外，绝大部分单位正在进行检查工作。检查工作这一整风运动的基本环节如果作的好，不仅可以使近十万的干部提高一步，而且可给全区三分之二干部的继续整风打好基础，对于今后工作的改进上也将有极大影响。这就是说，华北区的整风运动正处在一个最紧要的阶段。目前除了在检查工作中仍必须注意深入发掘问题外，还必须把已发现的问题加以分析。倘使对于发现的这一大堆问题。不加研究与分析（如果分析不了，就应继续读文件，以提高自己的分析批判能力），不找出这些问题之间的内部联系和本质所在，就笼统地给各种现象带上个什么主义什么主义的帽子，那就不会找出有效克服的根本办法来，至多只能空洞地喊几个口号，说说今后决心如何如何，这样还是不能最后解决问题的。
    总之，华北各级党委必须首先在这一阶段整好领导整好干部，整风后要认真地订出新的制度，把整风成绩加以巩固，并于今冬明春在基层党员中进行普遍整风，使华北全体党员从思想上提高一步。伟大的新的任务，正在考验着我们，我们必须取得胜利！
