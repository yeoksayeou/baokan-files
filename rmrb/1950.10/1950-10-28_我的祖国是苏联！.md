　　My Motherland is the Soviet Union!
    Yula Serdyukov's Autobiography
    I am afraid to recall my life in the British orphanage. But I cannot forget it. At night, as soon as I close my eyes, the hateful face of our English teacher peers at me in the darkness.
    I was only two years old when the fascist bandits snatched me from my mother's arms and sent me to the orphanage. Where my mother went, I don't know; no one ever told me anything about her.
    I started to remember things when I was living in the German city of Rosdorf. At that time, it was already under British rule. They forced me and other children like me to work from morning till night, often immersing us in water. The teachers would put little boys and girls who had committed offenses in wooden barrels filled with dirty water, holding us down and immersing us for several seconds. Because I came to the orphanage wearing shoes with dust on them, I was immersed in water once – how could I not get dust on my shoes after walking on the street!
    When I grew a little older, I was sent to school. We were taught in English, and it was strictly forbidden to speak Russian.
    Once, I boldly asked the teacher on duty, what happened to my mother, where was my father?
    "The best country in the world—Britain—is educating you. Don't think about Russia anymore. You have no one there!" he shouted, while slapping me in the face.
    The teachers called us children soldiers, and constantly reminded us that we would have to serve in the British army in the future.
    During the years I lived there, I never saw a play or a movie. We never played, and didn't even know a single game. Yes, we didn't even have the heart to play.
    Lying in bed, thinking, thinking.... I had a comrade, from whom I first heard about Stalin. He said to me:
    "The country where Stalin lives is our motherland. In that country, all children are loved, and even orphans like us are not bullied."
    But after hearing this, I thought: Is this true? I didn't believe that it was possible to live without fearing the heavy fists of the teachers.
    Many Russian children are still with the British. They live in orphanages in Rosdorf, Klingenberg and other places.
    When the Soviet officers found out where I lived, my mother sent me letters and her own photos, but the teachers withheld these things. I didn't see anything. Finally, my Soviet motherland rescued me from captivity.
    I now live with my mother in Libau. In the first few days after I came back, I asked my mother: "Will we always live so well?" Later, I went to school, became familiar with other children, and I saw that all the children lived as well as my mother and I.
    Now I am being sent to a "Children's Natural Sanatorium" to rest, and everything here is like a fairy tale.
    I often think of that child who first told me about Stalin, about my motherland. What a pity that he and other children—our Soviet Lithuanian children, Karlis, Franzs, Pusris and Quanta—cannot be as happy as I am!
    They are probably very tired from overwork, they need to eat...
    But our motherland will save them no matter what, it must rescue them from there.

　　我的祖国是苏联！
    尤拉·谢尔鸠可夫自述
    我害怕回忆在英国孤儿院的自己的生活。但是我又不能忘却它。夜间，我一闭眼睛，我们的英国教师的可憎的面孔便在黑暗中窥视着我。
    当法西斯匪徒把我从妈妈的怀里夺走送往孤儿院的时候，我才两岁。妈妈那儿去了，我不知道，关于她，任何时候任何人也没有对我讲过。
    我从生活在德国城市——罗兹多尔夫的时候起，已开始记事了。当时，那儿已经被英国人统治了。他们迫使我和其他像我一样的孩子们从早到晚地工作着，常常把我们浸在水里。把犯了过失的小男孩、小女孩放在装满了脏水的木桶里，教员并用力捏住我们，把我们浸在水里达数秒钟之久。因为我来到孤儿院的时候穿着带有尘土的皮鞋，便把我往水里浸了一次——我在街上走了一趟，怎能不沾上尘土呢！
    稍长，即把我送入了学校。用英文来教我们，而且严禁说俄语。
    有一次我大胆地问了一下值日教员，我妈妈怎么了，我的爸爸在什么地方？
    “世界上一个最优秀的国家——英国在教育你，你不要再想俄国，在那儿你什么人都没有啦！”他一方面这样喊叫，一方面给了我一个耳光。
    教师把我们这群孩子叫做士兵，并随时提醒我们，说我们将来一定要在英国军队里服务。
    我住在那儿的这些年间，我从来没有看过一次戏或电影。我们一次也没有玩过，甚至连一种游戏也不知道。是的，我们也没有玩耍的心思。
    倒在被窝里想着，想着……。我有一个同志，从他那里我第一次听到了关于斯大林的事。他对我说：
    “斯大林住的那个国家，才是我们的祖国。在那个国度里，所有的孩子都被人热爱着，就是像我们这样的孤儿也没有人欺侮。”
    可是我听了以后曾想着：这是真的吗？我不相信能够不怕教员的重重的拳头而生活。
    很多俄国的小孩仍在英国人那里。他们生活在罗兹多尔夫、克林戈别尔哥城和其他地方的孤儿院中。
    当苏联的军官知道了我的住处的时候，我的妈妈给我寄来了信和自己的照片，教员却把这些东西扣下了。我什么都没看见。终于，我的苏维埃祖国把我从俘虏中拯救出来了。
    我现在和妈妈住在里巴夫。我回来以后的最初几天曾问妈妈：“我们将永远这样很好地生活吗？”以后，我上了学，和别的小孩都熟习了，我看到所有的孩子都像我和妈妈一样很好地生活着。
    现在把我送到“儿童天然疗养院”去休息，这里的一切都像在童话中。
    我经常回想起第一次向我说关于斯大林、关于我的祖国的那个孩子。多么遗憾呀，他和其他的小朋友——我们苏维埃立陶宛的孩子们，卡尔里斯，弗朗茨斯，蒲斯里斯和关塔，不能够和我一样的幸福！
    他们现在大概由于工作过度而非常之累吧，他们要吃饭……
    但是，我们的祖国不管怎的是要拯救他们的，一定要把他们从那儿拯救出来。
