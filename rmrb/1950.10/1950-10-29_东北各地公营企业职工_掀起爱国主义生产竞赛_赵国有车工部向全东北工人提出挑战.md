　　Patriotic Production Competition Launched by State-Owned Enterprise Workers in Northeast China
    Zhao Guoyou's Lathe Department Challenges All Workers in the Northeast
    [This Newspaper reports] An patriotic production competition movement has been widely launched by state-owned enterprise workers in Northeast China to "build a strong national defense force and build a strong economic force," defend the motherland, and support the liberation struggle of the Korean people.
    Under the active promotion of labor hero Zhao Guoyou and model trade union worker Nie Bingju in the No. 3 Machine Factory of the Northeast Machinery Administration Bureau, a vigorous production competition movement has been launched throughout the factory. Since September, the factory's employee attendance rate has maintained a record of no less than 93.5 percent, reaching 96.3 percent on October 20, creating an unprecedented record for the factory's employee attendance rate. Zhao Guoyou's Lathe Department has also issued a patriotic production competition challenge to all workers in Northeast China. The challenge stated that they have used combat actions on the production front to smash the aggressive and provocative acts of U.S. imperialism. The entire workshop has not produced a single defective product in the past three months of July, August, and September. The average over-fulfillment of production tasks in July and August was 24 percent, and the production task for September was completed in just half a month. The task for October was also successfully completed ten days ahead of schedule on the 20th. They guarantee to demonstrate a higher degree of production enthusiasm to enrich economic and defense capabilities and defend their motherland. The challenge put forward three guarantees to all workers in the Northeast: (1) maintain a high degree of vigilance and stop sabotage activities by special agents; (2) stand fast at work posts, resolutely overcome difficulties, and resolutely complete national production plans; (3) continue to unite with technical and management personnel, strive to learn technology, and improve quality and output.
    After the production competition was launched in the No. 2 Machine Factory, production efficiency also continued to improve. The time for smelting one furnace of steel in the steelmaking plant has been shortened by about 17 percent compared to the past. The average daily output of rubber shoes in the Northeast Rubber Factory No. 7 in early October increased by 11.5 percent compared to September, and the first-class product rate increased from 94.89 percent in September to 98.6 percent. After the production competition was launched, many new records have also appeared in factories in Lushun, Dalian, and Andong. The first-class product rate of rubber shoes produced by the State-owned No. 8 Rubber Factory has increased from 99.73 percent in September to 99.9 percent. Since October, each branch plant of the Fushun Steel Plant has universally created new records accumulated on a daily basis. According to statistics from October 1 to 19, the finished products of the forged steel branch plant have exceeded the task by 69.9 percent, and the semi-finished products have exceeded 20 percent. The employee attendance rate reached 97 percent. The production competition movement in factories and mines in Songjiang, Jilin, Liaoxi and other provinces has also been enthusiastically launched. Workers at the Northeast No. 1 Cement Plant, which completed the annual cement production task in September, are preparing to strive to over fulfill the cement equal to 22 percent of the annual plan by the end of this year in the production competition.
    The Northeast Daily published a short commentary on the 25th, calling on the working class of the entire Northeast who have already participated in the production competition and who are about to participate in the production competition to further learn from Zhao Guoyou's Lathe Department. The Northeast Daily said: The working class of the entire Northeast is working hard and bravely to complete and exceed the annual production plan with a spirit of selflessness. Zhao Guoyou's Lathe Department's example proves that every worker in the Northeast knows how he should dedicate his strength to loving the motherland and defending world peace. Their actions are solemnly warning the warmongers: the Chinese people will resolutely defend world peace and absolutely will not allow any enemy to dare to invade their motherland.

　　东北各地公营企业职工
    掀起爱国主义生产竞赛
    赵国有车工部向全东北工人提出挑战
    【本报讯】东北各地公营企业职工已广泛地开展了爱国主义的生产竞赛运动，以“建设强大的国防力量和建设强大的经济力量”，保卫祖国，支援朝鲜人民的解放斗争。
    东北机械管理局第三机器厂在劳动英雄赵国有和模范工会工作者聂秉举的积极推动下，全厂掀起了热火朝天的生产竞赛运动。该厂自九月份以后，职工出勤率即保持了不低于百分之九十三点五的纪录，十月二十日已达百分之九十六点三，创造了该厂职工出勤率的空前纪录。赵国有车工部并向全东北工人提出爱国主义生产竞赛挑战。挑战书中说：他们已在生产战线上用战斗的行动去粉碎美帝国主义的侵略挑衅行为。全车间在七、八、九三个月来没有出过一件废品，七、八月份平均超过了生产任务百分之二十四，九月份的生产任务仅半个月即告完成；十月份的任务也已提前十日于二十日胜利完成。他们保证为充实经济和国防力量、保卫自己祖国而发挥更高度的生产热情。挑战书向全东北职工提出三个保证条件：（一）高度警惕并制止特务破坏活动；（二）坚守工作岗位，坚决克服困难，坚决完成国家生产计划；（三）继续团结技术人员和管理人员，努力学习技术，提高质量和产量。
    第二机器厂生产竞赛展开后，生产效率也不断提高。炼钢场熔炼一炉钢的时间已较过去缩短约百分之十七。东北橡胶七厂十月上旬平均每日的胶鞋产量较九月份提高了百分之十一点五，一级品由九月份的百分之九十四点八九增到百分之九十八点六。旅顺、大连、安东各工厂在生产竞赛展开后，亦已出现了不少新纪录。国营第八橡胶厂所产胶鞋一级品已由九月份的百分之九十九点七三增至百分之九十九点九。抚顺制钢厂各分场自十月份以来普遍创造了按日累计的新纪录。据十月一日至十九日的统计，锻钢分场的成品已超过任务百分之六十九点九，半成品超过百分之二十以上。职工出勤率达到百分之九十七。松江、吉林、辽西等省各厂矿的生产竞赛运动亦已热烈展开。九月份已完成全年水泥生产任务的东北第一水泥厂工人，已准备在生产竞赛中，争取于今年年底前再超额完成等于全年计划百分之二十二的水泥。
    东北日报于二十五日发表短评，号召已经参加生产竞赛和即将参加生产竞赛的全东北工人阶级进一步向赵国有车工部看齐。东北日报说：全东北的工人阶级正以忘我的精神，勤劳而勇敢地为完成与超过全年生产计划而奋斗。赵国有车工部的事例证明：东北每一个工人都知道应该怎样为热爱祖国、保卫世界和平而献出自己的力量。他们的行动正是严正地警告着战争贩子们：中国人民要坚决保卫世界的和平，绝对不准许任何敌人胆敢侵犯自己的祖国。
