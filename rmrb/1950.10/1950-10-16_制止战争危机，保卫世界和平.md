　　Stop the War Crisis, Defend World Peace
    Deng Zihui
    The United States flagrantly sent troops to invade Korea, carried out armed aggression against our territory of Taiwan, bombed and strafed our people in Northeast China, and directly interfered in the liberation wars of Vietnam, the Philippines, and other Asian nations. The series of crimes it has committed around the world, directly engaging in aggressive wars, fully exposes the heinous face of American imperialist war policies, and at the same time, seriously threatens and undermines the peace and security of the entire world. If such insane war crimes by the US imperialism are not effectively stopped, they will lead the world to another bloody massacre and great destruction. We believe that all the recent peaceful appeals and suggestions made by the Soviet Union in the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly, especially the "Declaration on Preventing the Threat of War and Strengthening World Peace and Security," fully meet the just demands of the people of the world and are the most practical and effective way to stop the current new war crisis and establish lasting world peace.
    The Chinese people have experienced nearly a century of unyielding national liberation struggle. After winning the victory in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, they immediately defeated the American imperialist plot to invade China in the four-year People's Liberation War, eliminated all the reactionary forces of the American running dog Chiang Kai-shek gang on the Chinese mainland, and thus victoriously established a peaceful, unified, free, and democratic New China. The Chinese people, who account for a quarter of the world's population, have always loved peace and have always resolutely opposed imperialist aggression. Now that the Chinese people's democratic revolution has achieved a great victory, we know how to use our strength to defend our victory and to defend peace in the Far East and the entire world.
    We advise the war aggressors of American imperialism and its satellite countries: in this people's century, the power of the people is incomparably strong and decisive. If you do not understand this, you may as well review the painful failures of the world's public enemies, fascist Germany and Japan, in the Second World War.
    At the same time, in order to sober up the minds of the American and British imperialist fascist warmongers, we write here this prophecy left by the great revolutionary teacher Lenin:
    "Once Anglo-American imperialism embarks on adventures (such adventures will lead to their political failure) and turns its armies into stranglers and gendarmes, they are bound to dig their own graves."

　　制止战争危机，保卫世界和平
    邓子恢
    美国悍然出兵进攻朝鲜，武装侵略我国领土台湾，轰炸扫射我东北人民，直接干涉越南、菲律宾及其他亚洲民族人民解放战争；以及在全世界所采取的一连串直接进行侵略战争的罪行，充分暴露了美国帝国主义战争政策的狰狞面目，而同时正严重的威胁与破坏着整个世界的和平与安全。美帝这种疯狂的战争罪行，如不加以有效制止，是会将世界引向又一次的血腥大屠杀大毁灭的。我们认为苏联最近在联合国安全理事会及联合国大会上的一切和平呼吁一切和平建议，尤其是：“制止战争威胁和巩固世界和平与安全的宣言”，是完全符合世界人民正义要求的，也是制止当前战争新危机，建立世界持久和平最切实最有效的唯一途径。
    中国人民曾经历过近百年不屈不挠的民族解放斗争，而在八年抗日民族战争获得胜利后，紧接着又在四年的人民解放战争中，击败了美国帝国主义侵略中国的阴谋计划，消灭了美国走狗蒋介石匪帮在中国大陆上的一切反动力量，从而胜利的建立了和平统一自由民主的新中国。占世界人口四分之一的中国人民，从来便是爱好和平，也从来便是坚决反对帝国主义侵略政治的，在中国人民民主革命业已取得伟大胜利的今天，我们晓得该如何使用自己的力量来保卫自己的胜利，来保卫远东及整个世界的和平。
    我们忠告美国帝国主义及其仆从国家的战争侵略者：在这人民世纪中，人民力量是无比强大的，是决定一切的，如若不懂，不妨将世界人民公敌法西斯德国和日本，在二次大战中惨痛失败的新史页重温一遍。
    同时为了清醒一下美英帝国主义法西斯好战分子的头脑，我们把世界革命伟大导师列宁在世时留下的这篇预言写在这里：
    “一旦英美帝国主义进行冒险（这种冒险将使他们在政治上遭受失败），并把军队变成扼杀者及宪兵时，他们势必自掘坟墓。”
