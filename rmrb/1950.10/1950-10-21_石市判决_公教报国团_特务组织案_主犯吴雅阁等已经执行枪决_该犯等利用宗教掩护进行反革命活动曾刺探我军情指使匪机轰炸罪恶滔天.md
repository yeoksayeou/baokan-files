Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 20th: The Shijiazhuang People's Court has sentenced the "Catholic Patriotic Corps" (also known as the "People's Self-Defense Corps," "People's National Construction Advancement Corps," later renamed "North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters Youth Pacification and National Salvation Vanguard Team," code-named "August 13th" Unit) gang for its counter-revolutionary sabotage and assassination activities. Principal culprits Wu Yage, Zhao Yake, Mi Erhai, and Yang Donglai were sentenced to death; Yue Leisi, Chen Daosheng, Song Guilan, and Liu Tongju were sentenced to imprisonment. Wu and the other three criminals were executed by firing squad in Shijiazhuang on the 16th. Wu Yage and others used religion as a cover for counter-revolutionary activities, developing espionage organizations within the church. Since 1947, they have been engaged in espionage activities in the Shijiazhuang, Pingshan, Lingshou, and Zhengding areas of Hebei Province, spying on our military and political intelligence, and instructing bandit aircraft to bomb targets, causing significant losses to the lives and property of the people in our liberated areas. They were completely smashed by the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau in April 1949.

    Wu Yage, from Liangjiayao Village, Pingshan County, was a priest in the Zhengding Diocese of the Catholic Church. This criminal joined the Kuomintang in 1946 and served as an executive member of the district branch. In 1947, he joined the "Catholic Patriotic Corps" espionage organization. In August of the same year, after receiving the task assigned by the espionage agency in Beiping, he returned to Shijiazhuang and began activities in Xili Village, developing more than 70 people, including Zhao Yake and Liu Tongju, as spies, and carrying out activities in 37 villages and towns in 16 counties and cities including Shijiazhuang, Pingshan, Lingshou, Zhengding, Wuji, and Gaocheng. After Shijiazhuang was liberated in November 1947, this bandit went into hiding in villages such as Benduzhuang and Tazikou in Zhengding County, and Xiaofengzhuang and Beiqiaozhai in Gaocheng County, secretly establishing intelligence organizations and plotting to sabotage our liberated areas. In January 1948, this bandit fled to Beiping and dispatched spies to travel between Beiping and Shijiazhuang to spy on and transmit our military and political situation. In August, based on three reports from Mi Erhai, this bandit drew a detailed map of the location of our Pingshan County government, using Jianjianshan as a marker, and directed bandit aircraft to bomb, destroying 709 houses, killing and injuring 34 people, and killing 37 livestock. In the same month, this bandit also forwarded the map of the location of our government offices in Shijiazhuang and other places to the Chiang bandit spy agency, and stipulated that red and white bedsheets and arson should be used as markers to instruct bombing. Since September 13th, bandit aircraft have continuously flown to Shijiazhuang and other places to bomb indiscriminately. In Shijiazhuang alone, 135 people were killed or injured, and property losses were extremely high. At the same time, Wu also instructed Song Bandit Bendu to infiltrate our liberated areas and collude with Yang Bandit Donglai in an attempt to assassinate our military and political leaders.

    Zhao Yake, from Paitang Village, Zhengding County, was a priest in the Beiqiaozhai Church of the Zhengding Diocese of the Catholic Church. In 1940, this bandit colluded with the Japanese Kou Kempeitai in Gaocheng and Ancun to organize a "Communist Suppression Corps," capturing and killing our revolutionary workers. In 1947, he joined the Chiang bandit espionage organization "Catholic Patriotic Corps" and served as the supervisor of the sixth squadron, investigating the addresses of our liberated area military and political organs, factories, and warehouses, and developing and covering up a large number of spies, forging our official seals, and carrying out various sabotage activities.

    Mi Erhai, originally from Gaojiaying Village, Ningjin County, now lives in Shuinianzhuang, Pingshan. He had participated in the bandit self-defense corps and was captured when Shijiazhuang was liberated, but later escaped. In February 1948, he sneaked into Beiping and joined the "Catholic Patriotic Corps." He then accepted the task from Wu Bandit Yage, sneaked back to Zhengding, and went to Pingshan and other places to conduct reconnaissance, and reported intelligence to Beiping twice. In August 1948, the bandit aircraft bombed Pingshan, which was the result of this bandit arranging the markers.

    Yang Donglai, originally from Xichengnan Village, Lingshou County, now lives in Longtiangou Village in the county. In 1946, he participated in the "Returning Home Team" twice, killing our revolutionary workers. In October 1947, he joined the Chiang bandit espionage organization. In April 1948, he personally drew a map, which was forwarded by Song Bandit Bendu to Wu Bandit Yage. In September, this bandit set fire in the Fengjiazhuang area of Lingshou County according to the instructions of Song Bandit, directing bandit aircraft to bomb, resulting in the death of two farmers. At the same time, he tried every means to assassinate our military and political leaders.

    Yue Leisi, from Wang Village, Yuanshi County, was a priest in the Zhengding Diocese of the Catholic Church. In 1947, this criminal colluded with the bandit Third Army of Shijiazhuang to harass the Zhengding liberated area. In June 1948, this criminal accepted the task assigned by the espionage agency of the "Second Office of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters" to cover up spies coming and going to carry out sabotage activities.

    Chen Daosheng, from Dongliuzhuang, Shulu County, was a missionary priest in the Zhengding General Church of the Catholic Church. After joining the "Catholic Patriotic Corps" espionage organization, this criminal served as the supervisor of the first detachment, and was also in charge of the finances of the espionage organization, and privately carved the seals of our village offices to cover up the coming and going of spies.

    Song Guilan, from Xizhuang Village, Zhengding County. This criminal went to Beiping three times in 1948 to report intelligence to Wu Bandit Yage and brought back telecommunications equipment to the liberated area to install a radio station.

    Liu Tongju, from Xing'an Village, Gaocheng County. In July 1948, he joined the "Catholic Patriotic Corps" espionage organization in Beiping, serving as the captain of the sixth squadron, and colluded with bandit troops to harass Shijiazhuang, but was defeated by our army on the way and fled back to Beiping.

    The Public Security Bureau of the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Government destroyed the above-mentioned espionage case in April of last year and conducted detailed investigations. In June of this year, the bureau formally filed a public prosecution with the Municipal People's Court. The Shijiazhuang People's Court conducted a preliminary hearing from July 11th to 19th; a formal trial was held from the 21st to the 23rd. 453 people from all walks of life in Shijiazhuang, farmers from the suburbs, Catholics, and monks participated in the hearing. Wu and other bandits confessed to the counter-revolutionary crimes they had committed with conclusive evidence. The People's Court announced the verdict on the 16th of this month, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of the Common Program on suppressing counter-revolutionary activities, sentenced Wu Yage, Zhao Yake, Mi Erhai, and Yang Donglai to death. Sentenced Yue Leisi to life imprisonment; Chen Daosheng to 12 years of imprisonment (this criminal died of illness in the hospital and was not executed); Song Guilan to 10 years of imprisonment; Liu Tongju to three years of imprisonment; Song Bendu is at large, and the case will be handled separately when he is apprehended. Wu and the other four bandits were executed by firing squad in the afternoon of the same day. (Attached picture)
