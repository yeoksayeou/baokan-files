Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from London: According to reports from London, the 49th Annual Conference of the British Labour Party opened on the 2nd in Margate, Kent, with the participation of all Labour MPs and representatives from local organizations, totaling over 1,500 people. Although, as Reuters pointed out, the attendees do not fully represent the Labour Party's grassroots, the conference still reflected the growing dissatisfaction and resistance within the party among the broad masses towards the upper-level leaders' betrayal of the working class's interests and their submission to the American war policy.

Reuters pointed out: "Towering over everything at the meeting was the fundamental question of foreign policy." According to Agence France-Presse, the conference received as many as twenty-seven proposals regarding foreign policy, the vast majority of which expressed dissatisfaction with the Labour government's foreign policy. These proposals were combined into a comprehensive proposal, which called for an end to the Cold War and proposed the reopening of international negotiations, the establishment of friendly relations with the Soviet Union, the declaration of atomic weapons as illegal, allowing the People's Republic of China to join the United Nations, developing trade between Eastern and Western Europe, and ending dependence on the dollar.

This situation made it difficult for the Labour Party Executive Committee to present its foreign and defense policy proposal. This proposal required Britain to bear a "heavy" "burden of rearmament" that would "bring a dark future to Britain" and "devote a large part of its resources to strengthening military forces." In an attempt to reduce opposition to this proposal at the annual conference, the Labour Party Executive Committee held three days of meetings to refine the wording of the proposal, revising it until the eve of the conference. According to Agence France-Presse: "The proposal used the most general terms when mentioning the thorny issues of Korea and Germany in order to gather votes."

At the beginning of the annual conference, Reuters reported: "There is a general sentiment that if American troops cross the 38th parallel, the delegates will feel seriously uneasy." During the first two days of discussions, Lant, representing East Salford, and another representative, Happer, spoke out against the aggressive war in Korea. Lant pointed out that the actions of the United States and Britain in Korea were to "maintain an imperialist foothold in Asia." Several representatives made it clear that the South Korean puppet army under American command had now crossed the 38th parallel, so the question of "who is the aggressor" was already obvious.

When the Executive Committee's proposal was submitted to the conference for discussion on the 5th, British Foreign Secretary Bevin made a special trip back from New York to personally attend and defend it for an hour. However, according to Reuters, during the discussion, representatives repeatedly spoke out in strong opposition. MP Mikardo "strongly condemned the government's surrender to American imperialism," and former MP Chamberlin said: The British people were seriously concerned that "the government's foreign policy is completely entangled with American militarism," and warned: "Don't think that flamethrowers and incendiary bombs have solved the problems of the Far East." MP Hughes rebuked Shinwell for "concealing the ugly reality of the Labour Party's leadership policies," and he pointed out: "They have turned Korea into a living hell, and yet they call this 'collective security.'" He predicted that "within a year, a rebellion will occur among the Labour Party's grassroots against the soaring cost of living caused by the government's economic policies."

Although the annual conference, under the manipulation of the Labour Party Executive Committee, passed the Executive Committee's proposal and rejected the comprehensive proposal calling for peace and the maintenance of British independence, the comprehensive proposal still received a not-small number of votes of over 880,000 from two national trade unions and thirty-nine local Labour Party organizations.

　　英工党第四十九届年会反映广大党员不满政府外交政策
    要求对苏友好及允许我国参加联合国
    【新华社七日讯】据伦敦消息：英国工党第四十九届年会已于二日在英国肯特郡马尔盖特开幕，参加者有工党全体议员及各地方组织代表共一千五百余人。尽管如电通社所指出出席者并不能充分代表工党下层，但是会议仍然反映了该党党内广大群众对于上层领导分子叛变工人阶级利益而屈从美国战争政策的日益增强的不满和反抗。
    电通社指出：“会上凌驾一切的是外交政策的基本问题”。据法新社报道，会议收到关于外交政策的提案共达二十七件之多，其中绝大部分都对工党政府的外交政策表示不满。这些提案被归并成一个综合提案，其中要求结束冷战，并提出重开国际谈判，建立对苏友好关系，宣传原子武器为非法，允许中华人民共和国参加联合国，发展东欧与西欧的贸易，结束对美元的依赖。
    这种情况使工党执委会在提出其外交与国防政策的提案时大感困难。这个提案要求英国承受“给英国招致黑暗远景”的“沉重的”“扩军负担”而“以资源的一大部分从事加强军事力量”。工党执委会为了企图减少这一提案在年会上受到的反对，曾开了三天会，来推敲提案的措辞，直到开会前夕还在修改。据法新社称：“提案在提到朝鲜与德国问题的棘手处时，用了最笼统的辞句，以便凑集票数”。
    在年会一开始，电通社即报道：“有一种普遍的情绪，即如果美军越过三八线，代表们就将感到严重的不安。”在头两天的讨论中，代表东撒尔福德的兰特和另一位代表哈普尔发言反对侵略朝鲜战争，兰特指出美英在朝鲜的行为乃是为了“在亚洲保持一个帝国主义的立足点”。若干代表明白指出：美国指挥下的南朝鲜傀儡军现已超过三八线，那么“谁是侵略者”的问题已经昭然若揭。
    在执委会提案于五日提交大会讨论时，英国外相贝文特地由纽约赶回亲自出席辩护达一小时之久。但据电通社称：在讨论时，仍一再有代表发言激烈反对。议员米卡多“强烈斥责政府投降美国帝国主义”，前议员常伯林说：英国民众严重关切“政府的外交政策完全与美国军国主义牵连在一起”，并警告称：“不要以为火焰喷射器和烧夷弹已经解决了远东的问题”。议员休士斥责辛威尔“掩饰工党领导政策的丑恶现实”，他指出：“他们把朝鲜变成了人间地狱，而却把这个叫做‘集体安全’。”他预测“一年以内，工党党员群众中将发生反叛以反对政府经济政策所造成的生活费用的暴涨”。
    在表决时虽然在工党执委会的操纵下，年会通过了执委会的提案并否决了要求和平和维护英国独立的综合提案；但是综合提案还是获得了两个全国性的工会和三十九个地方工党组织共八十八万余票的不小票数。
