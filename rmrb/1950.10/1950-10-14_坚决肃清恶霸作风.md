    Resolutely Eradicate 霸道 Style

　　霸道 style is the style of oppression and exploitation of the masses by feudal landlords and Kuomintang warlord bureaucrats. This style is completely opposite to the style of the People's Government and the Communist Party, and there is no similarity at all.

    But unfortunately, there are still a small number of Party members and cadres in our Party who have been influenced by the landlord class and the Kuomintang warlord bureaucrat rule, and consider themselves to be "officials," the "superiors" of the masses; the masses are "ignorant and unknowledgeable people" who should obey them in every way. They only allow themselves to act wildly and do not allow the masses to reason. If the masses make the slightest "offence," they immediately adopt the attitude of slave owners towards slaves, beating, scolding, detaining, and doing everything. There are also some Party members and cadres who, for their own base purposes, have done all kinds of bad things to oppress and exploit the masses. They embezzled and over-occupied the fruits of struggle of the masses in the land reform; they used their positions to blackmail and plunder the property of the masses; they arranged marriages and interfered with the freedom of the masses, and even raped women and seized other people's wives. Of course, the number of such people in the People's Government is not large after all, but in some villages, before the people have removed and punished them, they are kings and tyrants, rampant for a time, so that the masses in these places say: "Although the big sky of the people has not changed, the small sky here has already changed." They disregard the law and regard themselves as a special kind of person. As Comrade Stalin said: "Those who have had some merits in the past, and now regard themselves as dignitaries, actually think that Party laws and Soviet laws have nothing to do with them at all, but are specially made for fools. These people do not think that they should implement the decisions of the Party and the decisions of the government, thus undermining the foundation of Party discipline and state discipline." If they cannot make a painful determination to quickly correct these extremely absurd thoughts and behaviors, they will become incurable bad elements. In addition to conducting strict education to save those who can still be saved, those whose circumstances are serious and who repeatedly refuse to correct their mistakes should be immediately removed from their positions in government organs, handed over to legal trials, and punished according to law. If they are Communist Party members, they should also be expelled from the Party.

    Our Party has always opposed this 霸道 style. Our Party requires every Party member and cadre to honestly be "servants of the people" and "serve the people wholeheartedly." Every Party member and cadre only has the responsibility to do things for the people, and has absolutely no right to suppress the people. The title of Communist Party member is glorious, and revolutionary cadres are valuable, because we most resolutely and thoroughly oppose the oppressors of the people, and our ultimate goal is to build a communist society without oppression and exploitation. The reason why the people support the Communist Party and the People's Government is because the Party and the government led them to overthrow the oppressors and guided them from the slave status of the old society to become the masters of the new society. The Party, the government, and the people will never allow new oppressors to appear among Party members and cadres. The people will boldly and resolutely abandon them after their education is ineffective. As a Party member and cadre, one should become a model and example of observing laws and disciplines. Revolutionary laws and disciplines are the result of the Party's leadership of the broad masses in arduous struggle. Anyone who commits illegal and undisciplined acts in the new society will be subject to legal sanctions. Communist Party members who violate the law should not only be subject to the legal sanctions of the People's Government, but also be subject to Party disciplinary actions. Some old cadres who consider themselves meritorious and knowingly violate the law are doubly wrong and should be subject to the sanctions and punishments of the law and Party discipline even more. In the past two rectification campaigns of our Party, especially in the second rectification campaign from 1947 to 1948, we concentrated our firepower on opposing this 霸道 style and punished some elements with serious mistakes. That rectification campaign exposed the phenomenon of impure elements or impure styles existing in the Party to a certain extent and improved the relationship between the Party and the masses in rural areas. Now, it is completely right for the people to demand that some Party members and cadres correct their bad style.

    In opposing this 霸道 style, under normal circumstances, the problem should first be solved ideologically. The masses should be mobilized to correct their arrogant actions, and to distinguish between right and wrong, explain the advantages and disadvantages, and point out the harm this style does to the revolutionary cause and the cadres themselves, so as to make them thoroughly correct their mistakes. For some lawbreakers who violate Party discipline and the laws of the People's Government, or those who repeatedly refuse to correct their mistakes, it is also necessary to punish or purge them. Of course, the handling of such problems should be very cautious and serious, with a realistic spirit, grasp the appropriate measure, and achieve everyone's heartfelt conviction, and avoid the mistake of rejecting everything or punishing everything. However, all this is for the purpose of more effectively eradicating the 霸道 style, and there should be no tolerance for it.

### 坚决肃清恶霸作风

　　坚决肃清恶霸作风
    恶霸作风是封建地主和国民党军阀官僚压迫剥削群众的作风。这种作风与人民政府和共产党的作风完全相反，没有丝毫相同之点。
    但是很可惜，我们党内还有一小部分党员、干部，他们受了地主阶级和国民党军阀官僚统治的影响，认为自己是“官”，是群众的“上司”；群众则是“无知无识的人”，对自己应该百依百顺。他们只许自己横行，不许群众讲理。群众稍有“触犯”，立刻拿出奴隶主对待奴隶的态度，打骂扣押，无所不为。还有一部分党员、干部，他们为了个人卑污的目的，做了种种欺压群众、剥削群众的坏事。他们在土地改革中侵吞、多占群众的斗争果实；他们利用自己的地位，敲诈、掠夺群众的财物；他们包办婚姻，干涉群众的自由，甚至强奸妇女，霸占人妻。当然，在人民政府中这种人的数量究竟不多，但在某些乡村中，在人民没有撤换和处罚他们以前，他们却是称王称霸，横行一时，以至这些地方的群众说：“人民的大天虽没有变，我们这里的小天却已经变了。”他们目无法纪，把自己看成一种特殊人物。正像斯大林同志所说：“那些从前有过某种功劳，而现在俨然以显贵自居的人，他们竟以为党法律和苏维埃法律完全与他们无关，而是专为蠢汉制定的。这些人并不认为自己应该执行党的决议和政府决议，因而破坏了党纪律和国家纪律底基础。”他们对于这些极端荒谬的思想和行为如果不能痛下决心迅速改正，就将成为不可救药的恶霸分子。对于这种人，除了应该进行严格的教育，以挽救其中尚可挽救的分子以外，对于其中情节重大且屡诫不改者，应该立即撤销他们在政府机关中所担任的职务，交付法律审判，依法治罪。如果是共产党员，就还要开除他们的党籍。
    我们党历来反对这种恶霸作风。我们党要求每一个党员、干部，老老实实地作“人民的勤务员”，“全心全意为人民服务”。每一个党员、干部只有给人民办事的责任，绝没有丝毫压制人民的权利。共产党员的称号所以光荣，革命干部所以可贵，就是因为我们最坚决、最彻底地反对人民的压迫者，我们最终的目的是建立一个没有压迫没有剥削的共产主义社会。人民所以拥护共产党和人民政府，就是因为党与政府领导他们打倒了压迫者，引导他们从旧社会的奴隶地位变成了新社会的主人。党、政府与人民绝不允许在党员、干部中出现新的压迫者。人民对于他们在教育无效之后，就会大胆而坚决地抛弃他们。作为一个党员、干部，应该成为遵守法令、纪律的模范和表率。革命的法令与纪律，是党领导广大群众艰苦奋斗的结果。任何人在新社会中作出违法乱纪的事情，都要受到法律的制裁。共产党员犯了法，除了应受人民政府的法律制裁外，还要受到党纪的处分。某些老干部以功臣自居，知法犯法，更是加倍的错误，更应该受到法律、党纪的制裁与处分。我们党在过去的两次整风中，特别是在一九四七年到一九四八年的第二次整风中，曾经集中火力反对这种恶霸作风，并且处分了一些错误严重的分子。那次整风曾经揭发了党内在某种程度上存在着的成份不纯或者作风不纯的现象，改善了农村中党与群众的关系。现在，人民要求某些党员、干部改正他们这种恶劣的作风，是完全应该的。
    在反对这种恶霸作风时，在通常情形下首先还是应该从思想上解决问题，应该动员群众起来纠正他们的狂妄行动，并且向他们分清是非，说明利害，指出这种作风给予革命事业与干部自身的损害，以便使他们彻底改正自己的错误。对于某些违犯党纪和人民政府法令的违法分子或屡诫不改坚持错误的分子，就还需要处分或清洗。当然，处理这种问题应该十分谨慎，十分严肃，以实事求是的精神，掌握恰当的分寸，作到大家心服口服，避免一概排斥或一律惩办的错误。但是，这一切都是为了更有效地肃清恶霸作风，而不应该对它有任何宽容。
