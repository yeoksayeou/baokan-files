Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, October 17th: President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam recently sent a letter to the Vietnam People's Liberation Army, instructing them on what to do after the recent victory on the northern front. The letter stated in part:

    "The reason we won victories in recent battles is because our People's Liberation Army fought bravely, our people warmly supported the People's Liberation Army, and our government was resolute. However, we should not be complacent about our victories or underestimate our enemies. We must firmly remember that the recent victory is only the first step towards complete victory in our nationwide long-term struggle.

    "In order to learn as much as possible from this victory, we must hold meetings and establish training committees to review the situation of our implementation of the offensive plan, summarize experience, so as to develop our capabilities in all aspects, correct our shortcomings, and strengthen our combat effectiveness. In the meetings of this review meeting and training committee, we must fully use our most effective weapon from top to bottom – democratic criticism and self-criticism. Senior cadres must lead by example in the work of this review and self-criticism.

    "By doing this, we will promote our strengths and correct our shortcomings. By doing this, you will surely win greater victories in the future. I will be happy to send you more condolences and congratulations."

    General Commander of the Vietnam People's Liberation Army, Vo Nguyen Giap, recently congratulated the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in the Northeast War Zone, and called on all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army to strive with all their strength for greater victories in the entire Vietnam in the future.

    胡志明致函慰问部队
    号召从越北胜利中吸取教训总结经验
    加强战斗力为赢得更大的胜利而奋斗
    【新华社二十日讯】越南通讯社北越十七日讯：越南民主共和国主席胡志明最近致函越南人民解放军部队，教导他们在最近北部前线的胜利后应做的事项。该函略称：
    “我们在最近几次战斗中所以赢得胜利，是因为我们的人民解放军英勇作战，我们的人民热烈地支援人民解放军，我们的政府具有决心。但是，我们不应该对我们的胜利抱有自满或低估我们的敌人。我们应该牢牢记住：最近的胜利，只不过是我们全国范围的长期斗争走向完全胜利的第一步。
    “我们为了要从这次胜利中尽量吸取教训，就一定要举行会议，成立训练委员会，来检讨我们执行进攻计划的情形，总结经验，以便从各方面发展我们的能力，纠正我们的缺点，加强我们的战斗力。在这种检讨会和训练委员会的会议上，我们必须从上到下和衷共济地充分使用我们最有效的武器——民主的批评与自我批评。高级干部必须在这种检讨会和自我批评的工作中领导示范。
    “这样做，我们才会发扬我们的优点，纠正我们的缺点。这样做，你们今后一定会赢得更大的胜利。我将以愉快的心情向你们致更多的慰劳和祝贺。”
    越南人民解放军总司令武元甲，最近向东北战区的人民解放军战士祝贺，并号召人民解放军所有指战员全力为今后在全越南获得更大的胜利而奋斗。
