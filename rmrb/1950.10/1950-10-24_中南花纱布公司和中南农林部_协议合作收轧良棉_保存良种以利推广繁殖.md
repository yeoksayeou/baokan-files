　　Central-South Cotton Yarn Cloth Company and Central-South Department of Agriculture and Forestry
    Agree to Cooperatively Purchase and Process High-Quality Cotton;
    Preserve High-Quality Seeds for Promotion and Propagation

    [Reported by this newspaper] In order to preserve superior cotton varieties for promotion and propagation, and to establish a foundation for cotton industry production and sales cooperative organizations, the Central-South Branch of the China Cotton Yarn Cloth Company and the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Central-South Military and Political Committee will cooperatively purchase and process a batch of high-quality seed cotton in various cotton planting guidance areas or ginneries this year. The purchasing and processing areas include: Shanzhou, Luoyang, Zhengzhou, and Shangqiu in Henan Province; Jingzhou, Wuchang, Sui County, Mianyang, and Xiangyang in Hubei Province; Lixian in Hunan Province; and Yongxiu and Pengze in Jiangxi Province.

    After more than a month of consultation and research, the Central-South Cotton Yarn Cloth Company and the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Central-South Region reached a principled agreement on the cooperative purchase and processing of high-quality seed cotton on September 9th. This has been submitted to the cotton yarn cloth companies and agricultural and forestry departments of each province for consultation on specific methods; the cotton yarn cloth branch companies and the cotton planting guidance areas or ginneries of the agricultural and forestry departments in each region will sign contracts to carry out the purchase and processing.

    The agreement stipulates that the purchasing, ginning, and packaging work will be the responsibility of the guidance areas or ginneries subordinate to the local agricultural and forestry departments; the funds will be provided by the local cotton yarn cloth company, which will pre-pay 15 days of revolving funds based on the amount purchased; and supervisors will be sent to be responsible for assisting in the purchase and auditing of accounts. The affiliated institutions of both parties will maintain close contact and discuss purchasing business regularly.

    The purchase price will be determined by the local cotton yarn cloth companies according to the proportions stipulated by the central government and market prices, and the agricultural and forestry departments will be notified to implement it at any time.

    The ginned cotton will be entirely transported by the agricultural and forestry departments to the cotton yarn cloth company, and its impurities and moisture content must not exceed the specified standards. It is also guaranteed that the fiber length is uniform, pure, and consistent; the inspection work will be handled by personnel sent by the cotton yarn cloth company. All cottonseeds belong to the agricultural and forestry departments and are used to offset short-distance transportation, ginning, and handling costs.

    This cooperative purchase and processing of high-quality cotton is carried out in concentrated cotton producing areas, with the agricultural and forestry departments providing the labor and the cotton yarn cloth company providing the funds. In the current situation where the institutions of the cotton yarn cloth company have not yet been universally established, it greatly helps to promptly buy cotton from farmers, so that prices do not fall due to too much stock and no one to buy it. In this way, on the one hand, the interests of cotton farmers can be protected at appropriate prices; on the other hand, state-owned companies can also control more raw materials that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood to supply the needs of yarn factories. On the other hand, it also allows the agricultural departments to control a certain amount of high-quality cotton seeds, which is also very convenient for the planned promotion of high-quality cotton in the future.

### 中南花纱布公司和中南农林部  协议合作收轧良棉  保存良种以利推广繁殖

　　中南花纱布公司和中南农林部
    协议合作收轧良棉
    保存良种以利推广繁殖
    【本报讯】中国花纱布公司中南区公司与中南军政委员会农林部为了保存棉花的优良品种，以利推广繁殖，并为棉业产销合作组织建立基础，今年将在各植棉指导区或轧花厂内合作收轧良种籽棉一批。收轧地区包括：河南省境的陕州、洛阳、郑州、商邱；湖北省境的荆州、武昌、随县、沔阳、襄阳；湖南省境的澧县；江西省境的永修、彭泽。
    经过一个多月的磋商与研究，关于合作收轧良种籽棉工作，中南花纱布公司与中南区农林部于九月九日获得了原则性的协议，已交各省花纱布公司与农林厅协商具体办法；由各地区花纱布分支公司与农林部门的植棉指导区或轧花厂，签订合约进行收、轧。
    协议规定：收购、轧花、打包等工作，均由各地农林部门所豁的指导区或轧花厂负责；资金归当地花纱布公司供给，视收购数量的多少，预付十五天的周转金；并派监理员负责协同收购和稽核账目的工作。双方附属机构，将经常的密切联系，商讨收购业务。
    收购价格，根据中央规定比例及市场价格决定，由各地花纱布公司掌握，随时通知农林部门执行。
    轧成皮棉，由农林部门全部运交花纱布公司，其杂质水分均不得超过规定标准。并保证纤维长度整齐纯洁划一；其检验工作则由花纱布公司派人负责办理。全部棉籽归农林部门所有，抵作短途运输、轧花及手续费用。
    这次合作收轧良棉，是由农林部门出力，花纱布公司出钱在产棉集中区进行的。在当前花纱布公司机构尚未普遍建立的情况下，对及时买进农民手中的棉花，使价格不致因货多没有人买而下落，有很大帮助。这样，一方面在适当的价格下，可以保障棉农的利益；国营公司也可以多掌握一些有利于国计民生的原料，来供给纱厂生产需用。另一方面又使农业部门掌握了一定数量的优良棉种，对今后有计划地推广良棉也有很大便利。
