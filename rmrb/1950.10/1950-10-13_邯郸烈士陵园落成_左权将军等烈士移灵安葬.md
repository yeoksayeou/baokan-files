　　Handan Martyrs' Cemetery Completed
    Relocation and Burial of General Zuo Quan and Other Martyrs

    [Reported by this newspaper] During the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation who gloriously sacrificed their lives, including General Zuo Quan, Deputy Chief of Staff of the former Eighteenth Group Army, and martyrs Yang Yumin, Zhang Hengyu, He Yun, Gao Jiecheng, Lai Qin, and Chen Guanghua (a Korean comrade), were temporarily buried in Shimen Village, She County, due to the war environment at the time. In 1946, the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Assembly, to commemorate the martyrs, resolved to build a martyrs' cemetery in Handan. Now the construction of the Handan Martyrs' Cemetery has been completed, and the dedication ceremony is scheduled for October 20. The coffins of General Zuo Quan and other martyrs will also be moved to the cemetery for burial on the same day. The Handan Martyrs' Cemetery Completion Ceremony and Zuo Quan and Other Martyrs' Relocation Committee, which is in charge of the matter, has notified the former comrades-in-arms, relatives, friends, and family members of Zuo Quan and other martyrs to attend the relocation and public memorial service at that time.
