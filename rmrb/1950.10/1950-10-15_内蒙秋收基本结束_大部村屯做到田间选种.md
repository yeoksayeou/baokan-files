Inner Mongolia Autumn Harvest Basically Completed
    Field Selection of Seeds Achieved in Most Villages
    [By Our Newspaper] The autumn harvest work in the agricultural areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was basically completed by the end of September. In Jerim League, the main grain-producing area of the region, the more than 7.3 million mu of crops had a bumper harvest due to strengthened dike repairs and flood prevention. The total output was approximately 575,000 tons, an increase of 50 percent over last year. Zhao Uda League had a harvest of 70 percent of a normal year, yielding more than 100,000 tons of grain. However, because Xing'an and Huna Leagues suffered severe droughts in July and August, the more than 4.5 million mu of sorghum and corn experienced a 50 percent reduction in yield, affecting the completion of the region's plan to increase production by 8 percent this year. However, the region can still maintain last year's production level of 1.1 million tons.
    Simultaneous with the autumn harvest, all banners and counties earnestly carried out seed selection work. Most villages achieved field selection of individual plants, laying a good foundation for increased grain production next year.

　　内蒙秋收基本结束
    大部村屯做到田间选种
    【本报讯】内蒙古人民自治区农业区的秋收工作，到九月底已基本结束。该区主要产粮区哲里木盟的七百三十余万亩庄稼，由于加强了修堤防汛，获得丰收；总产量约五十七万五千吨，比去年增产达百分之五十。昭乌达盟七成年景，可产粮十多万吨。但因七、八月间兴安、呼纳两盟遭受严重旱灾，四百五十余万亩高粱、苞米减收五成，影响了全内蒙区今年增产百分之八的计划的完成，但仍能保持去年一百一十万吨的生产水平。
    与秋收的同时，各旗县均认真地进行了选种工作。大部村屯做到田间棵选，为明年的粮食增产打下了良好基础。
