Inspired by Chairman Mao's Letter to the Shijiazhuang and Other Electric Power Bureaus, Tangshan Electric Power Workers Guarantee Safe Power Supply

[This newspaper Tangshan News] After Chairman Mao's letter to the Shijiazhuang Electric Power Bureau and the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau's Three Factories was published in this newspaper (see page one of the September 17th issue), the Tangshan electric power workers, with joy and excitement, held meetings and discussions. They unanimously believed that Chairman Mao's letter was an honor for electric power workers across the country and resolved to respond to Chairman Mao's hopes for electric power workers with practical actions. The Party committee also decided to "mobilize all employees to carry out a movement where everyone is responsible and resolutely eliminate accidents to complete this year's departmental tasks." Administratively, the workers are required to make a hundredfold effort to complete the national electricity sales targets. After mass-based deliberation and discussion, the entire bureau put forward the glorious slogan of "Guaranteeing Safe Power Supply." Mechanic Dong Jinhe of the power plant said, "In the past, when talking about guaranteeing safe power supply, I was always hesitant, only daring to say 'strive for'; after reading Chairman Mao's letter, I not only dare to guarantee it, but also 'resolutely guarantee' it." Worker Chen Hong said, "During Red May, because everyone was focused, we guaranteed that the entire plant had no accidents for two months and eight days. Later, we relaxed, and there were two accidents on July 12th and August 5th. In the future, we will resolutely not dare to relax." The electric power bureau employees also reviewed the shortcomings in employee unity and personal work, based on Chairman Mao's instructions to "unite as one and work hard." For example, foreman Xin Guangcai and section chief Wang Mingtian expressed that they would no longer disagree with each other in the future. Some young workers proposed strengthening the unity between masters and apprentices, consolidating the master-apprentice relationship, and thirteen pairs of masters and apprentices signed master-apprentice contracts. The power supply section signed a contact contract with the material section to guarantee the power consumption tasks of a certain factory. Steam turbine, operation, boiler, and other departments all guaranteed "not a second of power outage." Workers in the pumping station would strive to "not stop water for a minute, not run empty pumps," "maintain standard water levels," "maintain standard vacuum," and "not neglect for a second." Technical staff proposed "relying on workers better, doing a good job in safety inspections, thorough overhauls, and eliminating all hidden accidents." The movement to eliminate responsibility accidents and guarantee safe power supply is being carried out enthusiastically in all units throughout the plant.

[Another News] Inspired by Chairman Mao's concern for the people's electricity cause, the employees of the Qinhuangdao Power Plant of the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau, under the leadership of the trade union, unanimously passed the fourth quarter's safe and accident-free production plan after discussions in various groups. At the mobilization meeting, each unit reported its specific plan and resolved to launch a challenge competition to the Tangshan Power Plant to completely eliminate accidents.

　　在毛主席给石家庄等电业局的信鼓舞下  唐山电业职工保证安全供电
    【本报唐山讯】毛主席给石家庄电业局和天津电业局三厂职工的信于本报刊载后（见九月十七日本报一版），唐山电业职工以欢欣鼓舞的心情，纷纷集会座谈，一致认为毛主席的信，是全国电业职工的光荣，并决以实际行动回答毛主席对电业职工的热望。党委也决定“动员全体职工，开展人人负责，坚决消灭事故运动，完成今年部定任务。”行政上则要求职工们百倍地努力，完成国家所规定的售电任务。经过群众性的酝酿和讨论，全局一致提出“保证安全供电”的光荣口号。发电厂机工董金和说：“过去说保证安全供电心里总是犹豫，只敢说‘争取’；看了毛主席的信后，不仅敢保证，而且要‘坚决保证’。”工人陈洪说：“在红五月里，由于大家精神集中，保证了二个月零八天全厂未出事故。后来一松懈，七月十二日及八月五日出了两次事故，今后坚决不敢松懈。”电业局职工并根据毛主席所指示的“团结一致，努力工作”检讨了职工团结及个人工作上存在的缺点，如领班辛广才与股长王明田，表示今后彼此不再闹意见。一些青年工人，提出加强师徒团结，巩固师徒关系，并有十三对师徒订了师徒合同。供电科为了保证某厂用电的任务，和材料科签订了联系合同。汽机、运转、锅炉等部门都保证“一秒钟也不停电”。水泵房工人要做到“一分钟也不停水，不打空泵”，“保持标准水位”，“保持标准真空”，“一秒钟也不忽视”。技术职员则提出“更好的依靠工人，作好安全检查，彻底检修，消灭一切隐性事故”。消灭责任事故，保证安全供电的运动正在全厂各个单位热烈展开。
