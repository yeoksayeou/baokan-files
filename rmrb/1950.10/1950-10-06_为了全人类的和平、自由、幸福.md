For the Peace, Freedom, and Happiness of All Mankind
    Xiao San

    Sino-Soviet friendship, the solid unity, cooperation, and mutual assistance between China and the Soviet Union, are of infinite benefit to China and of great significance to the Soviet Union – this is deeply understood by the people of both countries.
    The friendly unity of these two countries is also of great importance, even a decisive factor, for the interests of all mankind and all national peoples in the world.
    Why is that?
    First of all, both China and the Soviet Union have large populations. The Soviet Union has a correct statistic of nearly 200 million people, and China's actual population is over 475 million. The 700 million people in these two countries account for one-third of all mankind. Second, China and the Soviet Union are two large countries, their area accounting for one-fifth to one-quarter of the entire land surface. Third, China and the Soviet Union are both rich in resources and fertile land, both countries "so vast and wide" and "with countless forests, fields, and rivers." In addition to their large populations, vast territories, and abundant resources, fourth, China and the Soviet Union are both nations and countries with long histories and profound cultures. Fifth, and very importantly, the masters of these two great countries are now the people themselves, not a handful of exploiters and oppressors. The power of the people is infinite, especially after they have been liberated. In short, with the friendly unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union, there is no force in the world that can compete with it.
    This means that the unity and friendship between China and the Soviet Union have a decisive role in international affairs. The current international situation is divided into two camps: the imperialist aggressive war camp and the socialist democratic peace camp. In the socialist democratic camp, which is opposed to the imperialist camp, there are such large backbones as China and the Soviet Union, with the Soviet Union as the head. Isn't the victory of this camp absolutely guaranteed?
    Socialism and democracy are in favor of permanent and solid world peace. They need peace. In other words, peace comes with socialism and democracy. Isn't the friendly unity of two such large countries and so many people of China and the Soviet Union the most powerful guarantee of world peace?
    Comrades, for the victory of the socialist democratic camp, for the victory of the peace camp, for the happiness, freedom, and universal security of all mankind, let us redouble and multiply our efforts to strengthen the work of Sino-Soviet friendship and unity!
    From the end of May to the beginning of July this year, the author and the Chinese Delegation for the Defence of World Peace made traveling speeches in several large cities in East China, Central South, and Northwest China. In these places, we saw that the people all understand that Sino-Soviet friendship and unity are of absolute decisive significance for defending world peace and opposing aggressive war. Almost without exception, the movements to defend world peace in various places are closely linked with the Sino-Soviet friendship movement. After participating in the signature campaign against atomic weapons and defending world peace, many of the broad masses of working people have gone on to join Sino-Soviet friendship organizations. On the other hand, the activists of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in various places are also active participants in the movement to defend world peace and oppose American imperialist aggression. Thanks to the efforts of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and other people's organizations and social celebrities, organizations for defending world peace have been established in many places. Moreover, these two mass organizations in various places almost all work in the same office, and many of the staff members who do practical organizational and other activities are also part-time. Over the past few months, the signature campaign on the Stockholm Declaration has been vigorously launched and deepened across the country, and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organizations and activists in various places have undoubtedly made great contributions.
    This is very natural. The powerful Soviet Union is a reliable fortress of world peace. The heroic Soviet people are reliable guardians of world peace. The great Stalin is the standard-bearer of world peace and a symbol of the freedom and happiness of all mankind. If the people of all nations in the world truly want to maintain world peace, they must be friendly to the Soviet Union. You only have to see that the imperialist aggressors are always trying their best to oppose the Soviet Union to understand this truth. Therefore, the two tasks of world peace and friendship with the Soviet Union are as inseparable as form and shadow. Isn't this obvious enough?
    Defending world peace and opposing aggressive war have become a national movement throughout the world and throughout China. This movement, especially since American imperialism launched its war of aggression against our country's Taiwan and Korea, has reached a very high level. The number of people signing the Stockholm Declaration in China and in various countries around the world is the largest during this period. The people of the world are more aware, and American imperialism has taught everyone another lesson.
    On the great commemorative festival of the anniversary of the founding of their republic, the Chinese people have a deeper understanding of the value of world peace and the hatred of aggressive war. At the glorious commemoration of the anniversary of the founding of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, recalling the innumerable fraternal, friendly, and sincere selfless assistance we have received from the Soviet Union in various construction undertakings in this new people's republic over the past year is beyond measure. The author recently went to Dalian for recuperation due to illness. Lushun and Dalian are areas directly liberated by the Soviet army on August 22, 1945. According to the treaty, the Soviet army is temporarily stationed there. In this area, the author personally witnessed the Soviet people's warm help and care for the Chinese people, and their brotherly selfless friendship is truly moving! In particular, recalling not long ago, when the Kuomintang's Chiang Kai-shek was finally wreaking havoc on the Chinese people, the various brutal atrocities of the American imperialist bandits against the Chinese people, comparing those bloody, shameful crimes with the actions of Soviet friends in the Lushun and Dalian area, in the entire Northeast, and throughout the country, people can even more despise US Secretary of State Acheson's recent absurd remarks.
    Tell you, Achesons and Trumans, and all the American jackals in sheep's clothing! The Chinese people have learned enough about you pirate-like "friends." You spew blood and say something about "imperialism from the Soviet Union," "a dark cloud from the north," something about "Soviet infiltration"... The Chinese people only think you are "polluting the air." Your any slander and defamation will definitely not destroy the permanent, lofty, and intimate friendship between the two great countries and peoples of China and the Soviet Union. You are only exposing your ambition – attempting to permanently occupy Taiwan, re-enslave the Chinese people, and wanting to turn the whole of Asia into a US colony like the Philippines. What a "model is the Philippines in Asia"! Achesons, tell you, it can't be done! Do you "not think that any part of Asia has been lost"? Sorry, China has gone forever for you imperialists. Korea, Vietnam... and the Philippines, which you call a "model," will not be yours, you will lose them all!
    On September 10, Acheson gave us another lesson. The people of the whole world, the whole of Asia, and the whole of China must further strengthen their friendship and unity with the Soviet people. The greater friendship and unity between China and the Soviet Union are not only for the benefit of the two peoples, but also for the benefit of the peoples of the whole of Asia and the whole world, for the happiness, freedom, and peace of all mankind.
    Let us firmly remember and deeply understand Chairman Mao Zedong's words:
    "The unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union is extremely important. Once the people of these two countries are united, the unity of the people of the world will not be difficult." (Chairman Mao's inscription for the anniversary special issue of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, see the first page of this newspaper on the 5th)
    For the people of China and the Soviet Union, for the people of the world, we congratulate and we shout:
    Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!

　　为了全人类的和平、自由、幸福
    萧三
    中苏友好，中苏两国巩固的团结、合作、互助，对中国有无穷的好处，对苏联有莫大的意义——这是中苏两国人民都深切地了解的。
    这两个国家的友好团结，对全世界全人类和一切民族人民的利益，也有非常大的重要性，甚至于可以说是一个决定的因素。
    为什么呢？
    首先，中苏两国的人口都很多，苏联正确的统计为近二万万人，中国的实际人口当在四万七千五百万以上，这两国的七万万人口共占全人类三分之一。第二，中苏是两个大国，它们的面积占全地面五分之一到四分之一。第三，中苏都是物产丰富，土地肥沃，都是有“多么辽阔广大”而“有无数森林田原和河流”的国家。除了人口众多、地大、物博之外，第四，中苏两国都是具有悠久的历史和深长的文化的民族和国家。第五，很重要的，中苏两个大国的主人现在都是人民自己，而不是一小撮的剥削者与压迫者。人民的力量是无穷的，特别是得到了解放以后。总之，中苏两国人民友好团结一致，世界上没有什么力量能够和它较量。
    这就是说，中苏两国的团结友好，对国际事务是有决定的作用的。现在的国际形势分为两个阵营：帝国主义侵略战争阵营与社会主义民主主义和平阵营。和帝国主义阵营对立的社会主义民主主义阵营里面有中苏两个这样大的中坚力量，而以苏联为首，这个阵营的胜利不是有着绝大的保障吗？
    社会主义和民主主义是拥护世界永久而巩固的和平的，它们是需要和平的，换句话说，和平是随着社会主义与民主主义而俱来的。中苏两个这样大的国家和两个这么多的人民的友好团结，不是世界和平最有力的保证么？
    同志们，为了社会主义民主主义阵营的胜利，为了和平阵营的胜利，为了全人类的幸福、自由与普遍安全，让我们百倍千倍地努力加强中苏友好团结的工作吧！
    今年五月底到七月初，笔者和中国保卫世界和平宣传团在华东、中南、西北几个大城市作过旅行讲演。在这些地方我们看出，人民都懂得，中苏友好团结对于保卫世界和平与反对侵略战争是有绝大的决定意义的。几乎没有例外，各地方保卫世界和平的运动都是和中苏友好运动密切地联系着的。广大的劳动人民群众在参加了反对原子武器，保卫世界和平的签名运动之后，许多人都进而加入中苏友好的组织。另一方面，各地中苏友协的积极分子都是保卫世界和平反对美帝侵略运动的积极分子。由于中苏友协及其他民众组织与社会名流的努力，保卫世界和平运动的组织在许多地方建立起来了。而且各地的这两个群众性的组织几乎都是在一个机关里办公，作实际组织等活动的工作人员也有许多是兼职的。几个月来在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名运动之在全国蓬蓬勃勃地开展和深入，各地的中苏友协组织和积极分子，无疑地，是有很大的功劳的。
    这是很自然的。强大的苏联是世界和平可靠的堡垒。英勇的苏联人民是世界和平可靠的卫士。伟大的斯大林是世界和平的旗手，是全人类自由幸福的象征。世界各族人民如果真正要想保住世界和平，就不能不和苏联友好。你只要看帝国主义侵略战争者总是极力反苏，就可以明白这个道理了。因此，世界和平与对苏友好这两个工作，就像形与影这两个东西的不能分离是一样的，这难道还不明显吗？
    保卫世界和平，反对侵略战争，在全世界在全中国已经成为了全民运动。这个运动，特别是自从美帝国主义发动对我国台湾与朝鲜的侵略战争以来，达到了非常的高涨程度。在中国及世界各国，在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的人数以这时期为最多。世界人民是更加觉悟了，美帝国主义给大家又上了一课。
    中国人民在自己的共和国成立周年这个伟大的纪念节日里，更加体会到世界和平的可贵和侵略战争的可恨。在中苏友好协会成立周年这个光荣的纪念时，回想在这一年内，在这新的人民共和国里各方面建设事业中，我们得到了苏联的兄弟友谊的、至诚无私的帮助，是不可以数计的。笔者因病最近曾去大连疗养。旅大是一九四五年八月二十二日由苏军直接解放的地区，根据条约，苏军暂时驻守在那里。在这个地区笔者耳濡目见苏联人对中国人，一片热诚的帮助与关怀，兄弟般无私的友谊，实在令人感动！特别是回忆一下不久以前，当国民党蒋介石对中国人民最后逞凶的时期，美帝国主义强盗对中国人民的各种残暴兽行，把那些血腥的耻辱的罪恶和苏联朋友在旅大区，在整个东北和全国的一切行事对比一下，人们就更可以对美国国务卿艾奇逊最近的荒谬谈话嗤之以鼻了。
    告诉你，艾奇逊们和杜鲁门们，以及一切蒙羊皮的美国豺狼们！中国人民对你们这般海盗式的“友人”已经领教够了。你含血喷人地说什么“来自苏联的帝国主义”，“来自北方的一片大乌云”，什么“苏联的渗入”……中国人民只当你是在“弄坏着空气”。你的任何污蔑、毁谤、决然破坏不了中苏两大国家和人民永久的崇高的亲切的友谊。你只是自己暴露了自己的野心——企图永久占领台湾，重新奴役中国人民，并且想把全亚洲变成菲律宾一样的美国殖民地。好一个“菲律宾就是在亚洲的一个模范”！艾奇逊们，告诉你，做不到！你们“并不以为亚洲的任何部分已经失去”了吗？对不起，中国对于你们帝国主义者是一去不复返了。朝鲜、越南……以及你所称为“模范”的菲律宾，都不会是你们的，你们都要失去的！
    九月十日艾奇逊又给我们上了一课。全世界全亚洲全中国的人民要更加加强对苏联人民的友好与团结的。中苏两国的更加友好团结，不仅只为了两国人民的利益，也为了全亚洲以及全世界人民的利益，为了全人类的幸福、自由、和平。
    让我们牢牢记住并深深了解毛泽东主席的话：
    “中苏两国人民的团结极为重要，这两国人民团结一致了，世界人民的团结就不困难了。”（毛主席为中苏友协总会成立一周年纪念专刊题字，见五日本报第一版）
    为了中苏两国人民，为了世界人民，我们祝贺，我们高呼：
    中苏友好万岁！
