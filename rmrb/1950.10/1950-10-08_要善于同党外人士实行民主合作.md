　　Be Good at Democratic Cooperation with Non-Party Personages

Editor's Note: This article is excerpted from Comrade Pan Jiwen, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Suiyuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, "Review of the Question of Unity Between Party and Non-Party Members in the Party Rectification of the Suiyuan Military and Political Committee Organs" (originally published in the Suiyuan Daily on September 18). It is for reference in various regions.

　　Within the organs of the Suiyuan Military and Political Committee, Party members account for one-tenth; non-Party personnel, the vast majority of whom are insurgents, account for nine-tenths. Youth League members are also a minority. In the early days of the establishment of the organs of the Military and Political Committee, Party members and non-Party members were tense when they first came into contact with each other. They were polite to each other and unwilling to let the other see their own faults. As time went on, they saw some shortcomings and errors in each other. Most of these shortcomings and errors were not resolved in a timely manner, and gradually formed a gap between some comrades. These gaps once hindered the unity between some members of both sides. Now, the focus is on examining this issue from the perspective of Party members.

Some Party members have several incorrect understandings and attitudes regarding the issue of democratic cooperation between the Party and non-Party members.

First, some Party members have not yet turned the principle of "doing a good job of unity" into their actual thinking. Although the branch has repeatedly arranged for Party members to understand the thoughts and emotions of non-Party comrades, it has never been seriously implemented. The reasons for this can be analyzed as follows: First, Party members feel that talking to non-Party comrades is a painful burden. What they want to talk about, non-Party members are unwilling to talk about; what non-Party members want to talk about, they are unwilling to listen to. For example, some non-Party members look for Party members to talk about family problems and their own history, but Party members feel that they lack criticism and are unwilling to listen. The issues that Party members are willing to talk about are mostly about non-Party members criticizing their past or exposing the old system and old figures, but non-Party comrades are unwilling to bring up these unpleasant things that have already passed.

Correct Acute Illness and Drift Mentality, Help Non-Party Cadres Progress in an Appropriate Manner

In this way, an objective conversation formula is formed for Party members. They are unwilling to talk if it does not fit the formula. The branch leadership did not realize this point, but blindly and simply urged Party members to talk, which naturally could not produce results. This erroneous conversation formula was formed by Party members who had worked for a long time in organs in rural areas where Party members accounted for the vast majority; when the environment and the object changed, they were still accustomed to their old methods. This conversation attitude does not start from the analysis and study of the actual situation, it is a kind of empiricism, and therefore it is wrong. Second, Party members have a mentality of eagerness for success when talking to non-Party members. They feel discouraged after one or two unsuccessful talks. This is not the thinking of the vanguard, because they cannot raise the masses one step, so it is wrong. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his book On the Party regarding the Party's mass line: "Our responsibility is to use all effective and appropriate methods to enlighten the consciousness of the masses, no matter how difficult and how long it takes, this first step of work must be done well;" So, what effective and appropriate methods should Party members of the Military and Political Committee organs adopt for non-Party comrades? This branch meeting also suggested some methods: That is, not to be impatient, to start from the issues that non-Party comrades are willing to talk about, patiently help them analyze problems, and gradually improve them. The method of conversation should not be rigid and mechanical, but can be heart-to-heart talks and visits at any time and place during work and after tea. It must be affirmed that the vast majority of non-Party comrades have the desire and enthusiasm to "strive for progress." However, the change of thought must go through a repeated process of ideological contradiction and struggle to achieve. Only seeing the desire and enthusiasm to "strive for progress" and not seeing the twists and turns of ideological transformation will lead to acute illness; of course, not seeing the desire and enthusiasm to "strive for progress" will also lead to drift mentality.

Seriously Organize Party Members to Study, Overcome Complacency and Arrogance

Secondly, complacency and arrogance are common among Party members. The Academic Committee arranged for writing a summary of the study of the history of social development, and non-Party comrades wrote it, but some Party comrades did not write it; even more seriously, these comrades did not realize that this was wrong. Some Party members have less enthusiasm and initiative in learning than non-Party members. They have low cultural levels and lack scientific knowledge, but they are unwilling to learn from non-Party comrades, blindly embracing Party seniority and revolutionary history, and indulging in the beautiful dreams of "old revolutionaries" and "old cadres." What they are interested in is not the new situation and new tasks of the revolution, but the comparison of promotion, treatment, and other issues. The direct result of these complacent and arrogant thoughts and emotions in the process of democratic cooperation between the Party and non-Party members is that non-Party comrades dare not and are unwilling to approach Party members, "If you ignore me, why should I care about you?", "At most, I'll just go home and farm." Some non-Party comrades even observe the Communist Party from individual Party members and feel that "the policies above are good, but they can't be implemented below, the Communist Party is just like that." Objectively, the door for close contact between the Party and the non-Party masses is closed. This kind of complacent and arrogant thought and emotion is obviously wrong. The primary way to correct this error is to seriously organize Party members to study. "Learn and then know inadequacy." The higher the level of political theory, the more humble people are, and the easier it is for people who know a little bit to be complacent and arrogant. Stalin said: "What makes the Bolsheviks shine is not pride, but humility." We should implement this truth in our actual life. The erroneous attitude associated with complacency and arrogance is not being good at learning from non-Party comrades. Some of our Party members often like to measure people from one point of view, but are not good at analyzing people comprehensively. The result of measuring people from one point of view is: You have not been tested by war and land reform, and you have done some things that are not conducive to the revolution, then you are worthless and not worth learning from. If we start from a comprehensive analysis, we can understand that the people who are cooperating with us now, in addition to some people who opposed the revolution or were not revolutionary in the past, they all have some strengths, and it is completely possible and necessary to learn from their good aspects and give play to their positive factors. The ancients said: "When three men are walking together, there must be one who can be my teacher." Chairman Mao's humble attitude of "willing to be a primary school student" should be used as our action guideline.

Take the Common Program as the Standard for Democratic Cooperation Between the Party and Non-Party Members

Third, what standard should be used to implement democratic cooperation between the Party and non-Party members? Is it communism and socialism? Or is it the Common Program? There has been controversy in the discussion. If this issue cannot be resolved correctly, then an incorrect attitude will inevitably arise in unity. As far as Communists are concerned, publicizing communism and socialism is to publicize Marxism-Leninism, which is of course. If a Communist Party member does not publicize Marxism-Leninism, he is not a true Communist Party member. As a result of publicizing Marxism-Leninism, advanced elements among the masses will gradually improve until they join the vanguard of the proletariat - the Communist Party. However, advanced elements are always a minority, and the vast majority of non-Party masses cannot be measured by the standards of advanced elements. The democratic cooperation between the Party and non-Party members, in the period of the New Democracy, can only be based on the Common Program as the standard, and not on Marxism-Leninism as the standard. If this is required, it will inevitably lead to closed-doorism. In most cases, non-Party masses do not oppose the Common Program, but due to old habits, old ideological consciousness, and self-interest, etc., they inevitably adopt distorted, conciliatory, or even opposite attitudes towards certain parts of the Common Program in their words, deeds, and work. This requires Communists to carry out persuasion and education to help non-Party comrades improve to the level of understanding of the Common Program. Therefore, when carrying out democratic cooperation with non-Party personages, the attitude of Communist Party members should be to implement the Common Program in an exemplary manner and help non-Party comrades implement the Common Program seriously and thoroughly, and not others.

Publicizing Marxism-Leninism and taking the Common Program as the standard for unity and cooperation are not contradictory, because the Common Program is the scientific conclusion of analyzing the current Chinese society and solving the problems of Chinese society with Marxism-Leninism, which is the Communist Party's minimum program.

Consciously Create Ways to Discuss Issues with Non-Party Masses

With the correct understanding and correct attitude of democratic cooperation with non-Party personages, it is also necessary to learn some ways to discuss issues with non-Party personages. Generally speaking, with correct understanding and attitude, methods will be created in actual work. But it must be consciously carried out for research, analysis, and creation. If it is not consciously created, it will still hinder democratic cooperation. Because wrong methods, in a certain period, can also spoil things. This point is often overlooked by some Party members. According to the review of this conference, the following points are worthy of attention in future work.

First, attention must be paid to prior consultation on all newly occurring problems and new events. For major issues and complex issues, more attention should be paid to full deliberation. In this way, non-Party cadres can have ideological preparation, touch the bottom, and be able to boldly and freely carry out work; otherwise, if they are consulted only when things come to a head, non-Party cadres cannot put forward opinions for a while. Although they are consistent on the surface, they always feel in their minds that you are dragging them along, and it is difficult to give play to their enthusiasm.

Second, to be good at compromising on transactional matters in order to better adhere to principles. In actual life, those who are not good at compromising in this regard are often those who are not good at arguing in principle.

Third, to pay full attention to the requirements of non-Party comrades for political activities and social activities, and to organize a variety of activities suitable for their interests to meet various different requirements. Non-Party comrades in the organs of the Military and Political Committee are very interested in the activities of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, but the Party branch does not pay attention to this organization. For many years, Party members have lived a supply system life with a military communist nature. Their general life is simple, and they rarely participate in social activities. They often ignore the requirements of non-Party comrades in this regard, making many activities that could have been beneficial to the progress of non-Party comrades very lacking. This is very inappropriate.

Fourth, efforts should be made to improve the system and procedures of administrative work, and everyone should follow a charter, which can avoid many unnecessary misunderstandings.

Whether all methods are right or wrong depends on the specific time, place, and conditions, and there is no absolutely good method, so each unit cannot copy other people's methods. The above four points are only from the perspective of the organs of the Military and Political Committee.

### 要善于同党外人士实行民主合作

　　要善于同党外人士实行民主合作
    编者按：此文摘自中共绥远省委统一战线工作部部长潘纪文同志所作“绥远军政委员会机关整党中，关于党与非党团结问题的检讨”（原载于九月十八日绥远日报）。可供各地参考
    绥远军政委员会机关内，党员占十分之一；十分之九是非党员的工作人员，其中绝大部分是起义人员。青年团员也只是少数。军政委员会机关建立的初期，党员与非党员初次相处，双方情绪都很紧张。彼此客客气气，都不愿使对方看出自己的毛病。时间长了，互相间就看出了一些缺点和错误。这些缺点和错误多半未能及时加以解决，就逐渐在部分同志间形成隔阂。这些隔阂曾经阻碍着双方部分人员间的团结。现在着重从党员方面来检查这个问题。
    某些党员对党与非党的民主合作这一问题，存在着若干不正确的认识和不正确的态度。
    首先有些党员还没有把“搞好团结”的方针变成自己的实际思想。支部虽然多次布置过要党员了解非党同志的思想情绪，但始终没有认真执行起来。分析其原因，不外下列几种：第一、党员感到与非党同志谈话是痛苦的负担，自己愿意谈的，非党员不愿谈；非党员要谈的自己又不愿听。譬如有些非党员找党员谈家庭问题、谈自己历史，党员认为他缺乏批判而不愿听。党员愿意谈的问题大半是关于非党员批判自己的过去，或者对旧制度旧人物的揭露，但非党同志却不愿提起这些已经过去的不愉快的事情。
    纠正急性病与自流思想，以适当方式帮助非党干部进步
    这样，客观上就形成党员的一套谈话公式，不合公式就不愿谈。支部领导上没有认识到这一点，只是盲目地单纯地督促党员谈话，自然也就不能发生效果。这种错误的谈话公式，是由于党员过去长期间在农村中党员占绝大多数的机关内工作所养成的；当环境变了，对象变了的时候，他们仍然习惯于自己的老方法。这种谈话态度不是从现实情况的分析研究出发，是一种经验主义作风，因而是错误的。第二、党员与非党员谈话有一种急于求成的心理，一次两次谈不好，就泄气了。这不是先锋队的思想，因为他不能把群众提高一步，所以是错误的。刘少奇同志在论党一书关于党的群众路线中说：“我们的责任，就是用一切有效的适当的方法去启发群众的自觉，不论如何艰苦，需要如何长久的时间，这首先的第一步的工作，是必须作好的；”那么军政委员会机关党员对非党同志应当采取怎样的有效而适当的方法呢？这次支部大会也提示了一些方法：这就是不能性急，要从非党同志愿意谈的问题出发，耐心地帮助他们分析问题，逐步地提高他们。谈话的方式不能死板机械，在工作中、茶余饭后，随时随地都可以谈心、访问。必须肯定非党同志中绝大多数是有“力求进步”的要求与热情的。但思想的改变，是要经过反复的思想矛盾与斗争过程才能达到。只看见“力求进步”的要求与热情，看不见思想改造的曲折性，就会产生急性病；当然，看不见“力求进步”的要求与情绪，也会产生自流思想。
    认真组织党员学习，克服自满自大情绪。
    其次，党员中普遍地存在着自满自大情绪。学委会布置了写学习社会发展史的总结，非党同志都写了，有的党员同志却没有写；更严重的是这些同志并没有认识到这是不对。有些党员的学习情绪与积极性不如非党员。自己文化程度低，科学知识缺乏，却又不愿向非党同志学习，盲目地抱着党龄、革命历史，陶醉于“老革命”“老干部”的美梦中。他们感兴趣的，不是革命的新形势新任务，而是提拔、待遇等类问题的评比。这些自满自大的思想情绪，在党与非党民主合作的过程中所产生的直接结果，就是非党同志不敢也不愿接近党员，“你不理我，我何必理你？”，“顶多不过回家种地。”甚至有的非党同志从个别党员观察共产党，觉得“上边政策好，下边作不了，共产党也不过如此。”客观上关闭了党与非党群众密切联系之门。这种自满自大的思想情绪，很明显的是错误的。纠正这种错误的办法，首要的是认真组织党员学习。“学然后知不足”，越是政治理论水平高的人越谦虚，越是一知半解的人，越容易自满自大。斯大林说：“使布尔什维克增光的，不是骄傲，而是谦逊。”我们应当在实际生活中执行这一条真理。与自满自大相联系的错误态度，就是不善于向非党同志学习。我们有些党员常常喜欢从一点上衡量人，而不善于全面地分析人。从一点上衡量人的结果就是：你没有经过战争考验和土改考验，还作过些不利于革命的事情，那就一无可取了，不值得学习了。如果从全面分析出发，就可以了解到，现在和我们合作的人，除了有些人过去曾反对过革命或不革命而外，他们都有些长处，学习他的好的一方面，发挥其积极因素，是完全可以而且必要的。古人说：“三人行，必有我师”，毛主席“甘当小学生”的虚心态度，应当作为我们的行动准绳。
    以共同纲领做为党与非党民主合作的标准
    第三、以什么标准实行党与非党民主合作呢？是共产主义与社会主义呢？还是共同纲领呢？在讨论中曾经有争论。这个问题如不能正确的解决，则在团结中必然会产生不正确的态度。作为共产党人来说，宣传共产主义与社会主义，就是说宣传马列主义，那是当然的。如果一个共产党员不宣传马列主义，他就不是真正的共产党员。宣传马列主义的结果，群众中的先进分子，就会逐步提高，一直到参加无产阶级先锋队——共产党。但先进分子总归是少数，对广大的非党群众，是不能以先进分子为标准的。党与非党的民主合作，在新民主主义时期，只能是以共同纲领为标准，而不能以马列主义为标准。如果这样要求，就必然产生关门主义。大多数的情况是非党群众并不反对共同纲领，但由于旧的习惯，旧的思想意识，以及一己私利等等原因，而在言行中、工作中不免对共同纲领的某些部分采取曲解，调和，甚至相反的态度。这就需要共产党人进行说服教育，帮助非党同志提高到共同纲领的认识水平。因此，在与非党人士实行民主合作时，共产党员的态度，应当是模范地实行共同纲领，并帮助非党同志认真彻底实行共同纲领，而不能是其他。
    宣传马列主义与以共同纲领为团结合作的标准是毫无矛盾的，因为共同纲领就是以马列主义分析目前中国社会解决中国社会问题的科学结论，就是共产党的最低纲领。
    有意识地创造与非党群众商量问题的办法
    有了同党外人士实行民主合作的正确认识，正确态度，还必须学会同非党人士商量问题的一些办法。一般的说，有了正确认识与态度，办法就会在实际工作中创造出来。但必须有意识地去进行研究分析与创造才行，如果不是有意识的去创造，那还是会妨害民主合作的。因为错误的办法，在一定时期，也会把事情弄坏。这一点常常被有些党员同志所忽视。根据这次大会的检讨，有以下几点，值得在今后工作中加以注意。
    第一、一切新发生的问题，新的事件，必须注意事前协商。重大的问题，复杂的问题，更要注意充分酝酿。这样才可以使非党干部有思想准备，摸着底，能够大胆放手地进行工作；否则，事到头上才商量，非党干部一时提不出意见，表面虽然一致了，思想上总觉得是你拖着他走，难以发挥积极性。
    第二、要善于在事务性的事情上妥协，才能更好的坚持原则。在实际生活中，那些不善于在这方面妥协的人，常常正是不善于在原则上争论的人。
    第三、要充分注意非党同志政治活动与社会活动的要求，以适合于他们兴趣的多样性组织，满足各种不同的要求。军政委员会机关非党同志对中苏友好协会的活动很感兴趣，而党的支部却不重视这个组织。党员同志多年来过着军事共产主义性质的供给制生活，一般的生活简单，也很少社会活动，常常忽略了非党同志这方面的要求，使本来可以有益于非党同志进步的许多活动，却很缺乏。这是很不应该的。
    第四、要努力使行政工作的制度、手续完备起来，大家都按一个章程办事，就可以避免许多不必要的误会。
    一切办法是否对，都要看具体的时间、地点、条件来决定，没有什么绝对好的办法，因此各单位也就不能照抄别人的办法。上述四点，只是从军政委员会机关来说的。
