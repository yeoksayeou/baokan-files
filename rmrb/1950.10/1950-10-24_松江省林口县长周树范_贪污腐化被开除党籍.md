　　Zhou Shufan, County Chief of Linkou County, Songjiang Province
    Expelled from the Party for Embezzlement and Corruption
    Zhou Shufan (Communist Party member), the County Chief of Linkou County, Songjiang Province, has been found guilty of embezzlement and corruption, violating policies, and irresponsibility in his work. The Discipline Inspection Commission of the Songjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has submitted a request to the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Northeast Bureau of the Communist Party of China and the Central Discipline Inspection Commission for approval to expel him from the Party. It is also recommended that he be removed from his administrative position and handed over to the court for legal action.
    Zhou Shufan is from Anping County, Hebei Province, is thirty-five years old, joined the army in 1937, and joined the Party in 1938. His misdeeds are as follows:
    1.  Embezzlement and Wasteful Behavior: He embezzled approximately nine qian of gold, two hundred and four chi of cloth, fraudulently claimed five million yuan (Northeast currency, the same below) in surplus construction funds, misused three million yuan of public funds, and privately sold public sheep and bicycles for over one million yuan, totaling over thirty-one million four hundred thousand yuan, equivalent to over six thousand eight hundred jin of sorghum rice. He also privately set up a "small warehouse" worth approximately forty-one million nine hundred thousand yuan (all obtained through false reporting, fraudulent claims, and skimming). Total expenditures amounted to over twenty-nine million yuan (all handled and approved by him), of which eleven million five hundred and eighty thousand yuan was used for entertaining, giving gifts, and currying favor with cadres, etc. In addition, since arriving in the Northeast, he has continuously engaged in business for profit and frequently accepted improper private gifts.
    2.  Using Cadres Without Principles: He replaced cadre policy with personal feelings, which led to widespread dissatisfaction among cadres and caused significant damage to the work. For example, Xie Yujiang, whose work was not good but who knew how to flatter and give gifts to Zhou Shufan, was assigned by Zhou to be the director of the warehouse. Xie Yujiang privately altered expense slips in an attempt to embezzle, which was discovered. Zhou Shufan then protected him. When the cadres expressed their dissatisfaction, Zhou actually said, "Do you think the higher-ups will let you know how they handle things!" Zhu Hairun, the deputy manager of the grain company, was going to be dismissed by Zhou because he reported Zhou's embezzlement (because Zhu knew about this in advance, he resigned and went home).
    3.  Irresponsibility in Work, Decadent Lifestyle: When Linkou County convened its second People's Representative Conference, it was decided beforehand that he would make a work report at the meeting. However, he did not prepare at all, and others had to deliver the report on his behalf during the meeting. In May, a pest infestation occurred at the Qingshan Farm in the county. After he learned about it, he showed no concern, resulting in thirty-eight qing of soybeans being completely eaten by pests. In other work, he also consistently displayed evasion and passivity. In terms of lifestyle, his relationships with women were very chaotic. His wife was sent back to Guan Nei because she expressed dissatisfaction with him; he also used his position to pursue female comrades through improper means. In addition, he privately placed Ma Yajun, a female staff member who had been dismissed from the county's department store for embezzlement, in a position at the county government, and soon after, they lived together. These things had a very bad influence among cadres and the masses.
    When the higher-ups asked him to make a self-criticism, he did not seriously examine his own thoughts and correct his mistakes but instead attempted to deceive the organization with dishonest means, using various methods to conceal his embezzlement.
    The Discipline Inspection Commission of the Songjiang Provincial Committee believes that Zhou Shufan has lost the qualities of a Communist Party member; in order to uphold Party discipline and educate the entire Party, it has requested approval from the higher authorities to impose the punishment of expulsion from the Party.

### 松江省林口县长周树范  贪污腐化被开除党籍

　　松江省林口县长周树范
    贪污腐化被开除党籍
    松江省林口县县长周树范（中共党员），贪污腐化，违犯政策，工作不负责任。中共松江省委纪律检查委员会现已呈请中共东北局纪律检查委员会及中央纪律检查委员会批准，决定开除其党籍，同时建议行政上给以撤职处分并送法院法办。
    周树范是河北安平县人，三十五岁，一九三七年入伍，一九三八年入党。他的劣迹如下：
    一、贪污浪费行为：前后贪污的财物计有金子九钱左右，布二百零四尺，冒领剩余建筑费五百万元（东北币，下同），私用公款三百万元，私卖公家羊及自行车得款百余万元，共计三千一百四十余万元，折合高粮米六千八百余斤。他又私设“小仓库”，值四千一百九十万元左右（皆用虚报、冒领、揩油等方式得来）。总支出二千九百余万（完全由他经手批准），其中一千一百五十八万元是用来请客、送礼、拉拢干部等等。此外，他到东北后，就不断经商营利，并经常接受不正当的私人礼物。
    二、使用干部，毫无原则。他以私人感情代替干部政策；因而使干部普遍不满，并使工作受到很大损失。如谢雨江，工作不好，但能拍马、送礼物给周树范。周树范就分配他作仓库主任。谢雨江私改花费条子，企图贪污，被人查出了。周树范便包庇他。干部们表示不满时，周竟说：“上级处理问题，还让你们知道！”粮食公司副经理朱海润，因为反映了周的贪污事实，周就决定把他撤职（因朱事先知道了这事，就辞职回家了）。
    三、工作不负责，生活堕落。林口县召开第二次人民代表会，事前决定由他在会上作工作报告。但他竟不作准备，开会时只得由别人代他作报告。五月间，该县青山农场发生虫灾，他知道后竟毫不关心，致使该农场三十八垧黄豆全被虫吃光。在其他工作中，他也一贯表现了推诿、被动。在生活上，男女关系很乱，其妻因对他表示不满，即被送回关内；他并利用职权，以不正当手段追求女同志。此外，他又把该县百货公司因贪污而被开除的女职员马亚军，私自安插在县政府工作，不久即和她同居了。这些事情，在干部、群众中造成极坏的影响。
    上级要他检讨时，他并不认真检讨自己的思想，改正错误，却企图以不老实的手段来欺骗组织，用各种办法隐瞒自己的贪污事实。
    松江省委纪律检查委员会认为周树范已经失去了共产党员的品质；为了严肃党的纪律，教育全党，已呈请上级批准给予开除党籍处分。
