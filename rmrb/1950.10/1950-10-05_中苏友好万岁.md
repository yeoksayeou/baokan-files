　　Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship
    Liu Yazi
    "Taking Russia as a Teacher" was Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "final conclusion in his later years," and also the fundamental spirit of the reorganization of the Chinese Kuomintang.

    This fundamental spirit was unfortunately undermined by the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. After the "April 12th Incident," everything was a complete mess. The lackeys who sold themselves out, failed to rely on Japanese imperialism, and are now dreaming their final dream, relying on American imperialism and slandering the Soviet Union. They wear Dr. Sun's hat to oppose Dr. Sun's fundamental spirit, which is truly heartbreaking!

    The Soviet Union is the fortress of world peace, the big brother of all oppressed nations and oppressed classes in the world. Especially for our Chinese nation, from the enlightenment era of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's alliance with Russia, until now, under the leadership of our leading party, the Chinese Communist Party, and the guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao, we have concluded the unprecedented Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. The friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union should truly be renewed daily and be eternally immortal like the sun.

    "Taking Russia as a Teacher," thirty years ago, was Dr. Sun's visionary foresight. Today, it is the national policy of the People's Republic of China. How wholeheartedly should we support it!

    We are delighted to celebrate the first anniversary of the founding of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, to celebrate this great event. Let us shout:

    Long Live Chairman Mao!

    Long Live Marshal Stalin!

    Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship!

　　中苏友好万岁
    柳亚子
    《以俄为师》，是孙中山先生的“晚年定论”；也是中国国民党改组的基本精神。
    这基本精神，不幸被叛徒蒋中正所破坏了。“四·一二”以后，一切的一切，都搅得一团糟。卖身投靠的奴才们，依附日帝没有成功，现在又做着最后的幻梦，依附美帝，诽谤苏联。他们戴上了孙先生的帽子，来反对孙先生的基本精神，真是何等痛心的事情！
    苏联是全世界和平的堡垒，是全世界被压迫民族和被压迫阶级的老大哥。尤其是我们中华民族，从孙先生联俄运动的启蒙时代起，一直到现在，在我们的领导党中国共产党和我们的伟大领袖毛主席的指导之下，缔结了史无前例的中苏友好同盟互助条约，中苏两大民族的友谊，真应该是日新又新地和太阳同其永恒不朽了。
    《以俄为师》，在三十年前，是孙先生哲人的远见，在今天是中华人民共和国的国策，我们应该怎样的全心全意来拥护呀！
    欣逢中苏友协总会成立一周年纪念，来庆祝这伟大的盛典，让我们高呼：
    毛主席万岁！
    斯大林大元帅万岁！
    中苏友好万岁！
