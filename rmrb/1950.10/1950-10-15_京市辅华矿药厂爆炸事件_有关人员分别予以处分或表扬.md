(Jing City News Agency) Regarding the personnel involved in the Fuhua Heji Mining Pharmaceutical Factory explosion in Jing City, the Beijing Municipal People's Government and the North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have investigated and clarified responsibilities, and upon submission to the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council and the People's Revolutionary Military Commission for approval, have imposed respective punishments. Those who worked diligently in the aftermath of this incident will be commended and rewarded by the relevant departments.

Following the explosion at the Fuhua Heji Mining Pharmaceutical Factory, jointly operated by the 208th Division Production Committee and private merchants on June 14th of this year, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, in addition to immediately mobilizing rescue efforts and reporting the incident to the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council requesting action, convened an emergency meeting the next day inviting relevant units at the central, North China, and municipal levels to decide on measures for handling the aftermath. Simultaneously, the Fuhua Incident Aftermath Relief Committee was established, dispatching a large number of cadres to actively carry out various relief efforts: rescuing the wounded, clearing the site, burying the dead, distributing consolation money, relief funds, and housing repair funds, and providing substantial loans to help disaster-stricken households repair their homes and purchase furniture, or relocate from the disaster area to resettle and resume business. Tax payments for disaster-stricken industrial and commercial households were reduced, exempted, or deferred. To prevent such unfortunate incidents from happening again, the Municipal People's Government ordered the Public Security Bureau to require all factories within the city manufacturing explosives, flammable, poisonous, and malodorous hazardous materials to relocate to designated areas in the southern suburbs within a specific time limit. Secretary-General Xue Zizheng reported on the occurrence and handling of this incident to the Third Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference in August on behalf of the Municipal Government. Regarding the investigation of responsibility, the Central Supervisory Committee, the Municipal People's Supervisory Committee, and the North China Military Region Discipline Inspection Committee jointly conducted investigations, clarified responsibilities, and proposed specific handling opinions. After the Municipal Government and the North China Military Region submitted a report to the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council and the People's Revolutionary Military Commission for instructions, the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council and the People's Revolutionary Military Commission have approved the following punishments and rewards for personnel involved in this incident:

First, Personnel to be Punished:

(1) Chen Jinyu, Commander of the 208th Division, adopted a bureaucratic style in relation to the Fuhua Mining Pharmaceutical Factory. For example, he knew that explosives were being transported to Beijing but did not stop it; on May 19th, when a fire resulted in the death and injury of one worker each, he did not report it to the North China Military Region; and he did not urge the relocation of the factory. He lacked a serious and responsible attitude towards the factory's hazards and the safety of the people's lives and property, resulting in this incident. He should be given a circular warning.

(2) Li Jincai, Deputy Commander of the 208th Division, Deputy Director of the Division Production Committee, and Director of the Production Cooperative, was responsible for leading the division's production. After the fire on May 19th resulted in the death and injury of workers, although he urged Manager Li Yinghua four times to relocate the factory within a week, he did not enforce it resolutely. He finally said, "You handle it as you see fit," resulting in this incident. He should be given a circular warning.

(3) Li Peizhi, Chief of Staff of the 208th Division, was responsible for leading the factory from the beginning of the joint venture in early February to May 15th, but he never visited the factory to arrange and inspect work. He neither fulfilled the contract signed with the Armaments Department of the North China Military Region to process and modify waste explosives in Mentougou, nor paid attention to the factory's safety equipment. Furthermore, he improperly used the names of the Division Commander and Political Commissar to write to the Public Security Bureau requesting exemption from external guarantees for purchasing raw materials and promoting finished products, leading to this explosion incident. He should be dismissed from his post.

(4) Gou Yougui, Supply Minister of the 208th Division, for the sake of petty profits, extracted medicine from landmines and allowed the Fuhua Mining Pharmaceutical Factory to handle landmines entrusted by the Changxindian District Government for destruction. He should be given a warning.

(5) Deng Jinguo, Ordnance Section Chief of the Supply Department of the 208th Division, was the contract signatory. He did not raise objections to violations of the contract, and after the fire on May 19th, he ignored workers' warnings and actively advocated transporting landmines to the factory. As someone working in ordnance, he knew the dangers of landmines but did not pay attention. He should be dismissed from his post and handed over to the military court for adjudication.

(6) Zhu Liangcai, Director of the Political Department of the North China Military Region, was the Director of the Military Region Production Committee, but in fact, he did not directly manage or lead the factory's work. After the incident occurred, he requested punishment on his own initiative and should be exempted from deliberation.

(7) Li Yinghua, Manager of the Fuhua Mining Pharmaceutical Factory, Qu Derun, Deputy Manager, Wang Zhuping, Deputy Manager and Chief Technician, Wang Ziliang, General Affairs Director, and Wang Dianwen, Resident Director, were directly responsible for the factory's leadership and management. However, after the landmines were transported to the factory, they did not stop it or report it to the Public Security Bureau. After the fire on May 19th, they knew that the factory's location was unsuitable, and despite repeated urging from the Deputy Commander of the 208th Division to move, they did not comply. They also did not send technicians to guide the disassembly of landmines, and they did not adopt the workers' suggestion to disassemble the landmines by the river. They should all bear direct responsibility for this explosion incident and should be punished by the People's Court according to law.

(8) Liu Jianzhong, Director of the East Suburban Public Security Sub-bureau of Beijing, did not inspect the Fuhua Mining Pharmaceutical Factory after the fire accident on May 19th. On June 4th, he even submitted an opinion to the Public Security Bureau stating that "the factory's equipment is still considered complete, and a license should be issued." He also did not report the residents' opinion that the factory's location was inappropriate and requested relocation to higher authorities. Furthermore, he did not humbly examine himself after the incident, and only sought to evade responsibility. He should be dismissed from his post.

(9) Li Qi, Deputy Section Chief of the Control Section of the Public Order Division of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, and Wang Qikun, a staff member, were both specifically responsible for managing the business of gunpowder manufacturers. Usually, the Deputy Section Chief Li Qi did not adequately lead Wang Qikun and was negligent in supervising inspections. Wang Qikun did not strictly investigate the factory's private transportation of a large amount of waste materials to the factory without the Public Security Bureau issuing a transportation permit, and did not report it to higher authorities. Both were derelict in their duties and should each be given two major demerits.

(10) Xie Lizhi, Deputy Section Chief of the Public Order Division of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, was responsible for leading control operations. He lacked supervision and inspection of control work in peacetime. He failed to study and thoroughly implement the management measures announced on April 1st in a timely manner, and did not attach importance to the fire incident on May 19th, failing to take effective measures. All of this constitutes a failure to fulfill his duties and should be given one major demerit.

(11) Li Yangyue, Section Chief of the Public Order Division of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, abandoned his due inspection responsibilities. He catered to the factory's difficulties regarding the order issued by the Beijing Municipal People's Government on April 22nd to relocate all existing gunpowder factories to safe areas within a time limit, and proposed a suggestion to postpone the relocation. He should be given a severe warning.

(12) He Shenggao, Second Deputy Director of the Third Division of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, was responsible for leading control operations. He lacked sufficient research and depth in his work, and instead approved the Public Order Division's suggestion to postpone the relocation. He should be given a severe warning.

(13) Luo Ruiqing, Director of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, had been on sick leave for half a year, and his duties were delegated to Deputy Director Feng Jiping. He should be exempted from punishment. Deputy Director Feng Jiping, Zhang Minghe, and Wu Chuangchen, First Deputy Director of the Third Division, should each be given a warning for failing to strictly supervise and inspect operations.

(14) Ma Haishui, District Chief of the Thirteenth District of Beijing (now the Tenth District), did not pay attention to residents' complaints about the factory's odor and unsanitary conditions in September of last year, and did not pay attention after the fire on May 19th. He neither inspected the factory nor reported to higher authorities. He turned a blind eye to the fact that the Fuhua Mining Pharmaceutical Factory was located in a densely populated area within his district's jurisdiction. He should be given one demerit.

(15) Mayor Nie Rongzhen, Deputy Mayors Zhang Youyu and Wu Han, regarding gunpowder and sulfur manufacturers, after announcing elimination measures and time-limited relocation orders, the responsible personnel for implementation and control failed in their duties, leading to the accident. After the incident occurred, they requested punishment on their own initiative and should be exempted from discussion.

Second, Personnel to be Commended:

Yi Bosheng, Political Commissar of the Fire Brigade of the Public Security Bureau, is usually actively responsible for fire prevention work. After the fire incident on May 19th, he discovered that the factory's location was inappropriate and immediately urged the factory to relocate to a safe area. When reporting to He Shenggao, Second Deputy Director of the Third Division of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, he once again raised the opinion that the factory should be urged to relocate. Furthermore, students from the Public Security School and comrades from the Municipal Party Committee Cadre Training Class actively participated in the rescue efforts after the explosion incident, greatly reducing the number of deaths among disaster victims. The troops of the 208th Division worked hard and diligently in the aftermath work, establishing good military-civilian relations. The Army Hospital provided enthusiastic treatment and greatly promoted the glorious tradition of the medical personnel of the People's Liberation Army in carrying out political work among the wounded, providing great comfort and inspiration to the injured disaster victims. The relevant authorities should investigate and commend and reward the above-mentioned personnel who have made contributions.

After receiving this instruction, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has ordered the relevant departments to comply and implement it. As for Li Yinghua, Qu Derun, and others who were transferred to the court for trial, the Municipal People's Court has concluded its trial and will pronounce the sentence according to law. In addition, the Fuhua Incident Aftermath Relief Committee was actively responsible and conducted in-depth investigations and research in its aftermath work, quickly and appropriately handling various complex issues, allowing the vast majority of disaster victims to reduce or avoid the suffering of hunger, cold, and displacement, fully demonstrating the excellent work style of the People's Government and personnel of people's organizations. The Municipal Government has also issued a circular to commend these personnel who have fulfilled their responsibilities.

    今年六月十四日，由二○八师生产委员会与私商合股经营的辅华合记矿药制造厂发生爆炸事件后，京市人民政府除立即动员抢救并将事件经过呈报中央人民政府政务院请求处分外；翌日即约请中央、华北及市级有关单位，举行紧急会议，决定善后办法；同时，成立辅华事件善后救济委员会，调集大批干部，积极进行各项善后救济工作：抢救伤员、整理现场、安葬死者、发放抚恤金、救济金、房屋修缮金等，又贷出大量款项协助被灾户修建房屋添置具，或迁出灾区安家复业，对于被灾工商业户的税款则分别予以减、免或缓征。为了使今后不再发生此类不幸事件，市人民政府并明令公安局令市内各制造爆炸、易燃、毒臭等危险物品的工厂于一定限期内，一律迁往南郊指定地区。今年八月薛子正秘书长曾代表市府向本市第二届第三次各界人民代表会议报告了关于这一事件的发生和处理经过。关于追究责任方面，由中央监察委员会、市人民监察委员会和华北军区纪律检查委员会共同进行调查研究，查明责任，并提出了具体处理意见，经市府与华北军区呈报中央人民政府政务院与人民革命军事委员会核示，现中央人民政府政务院与人民革命军事委员会已予批复，对此次事件有关人员分别给予如下的处分和奖励：
