　　Peace Propaganda Team in Pingyuan Province
　　Tian Bing
　　The south bank of the Yellow River in Pingyuan Province, the west bank of Liangshanbo and Nanyang Lake, used to be the area where the fighting against the enemy was the fiercest, suffering from war and natural disasters for many years. Last year's great flood made this area suffer heavily again, but this year's autumn harvest is predicted to be the best in ten years. Old farmers breathed a sigh of relief and said, "After ten years of hard fighting, this is the beginning of good days!" In the sunshine, they rolled with joyful tears, smiling at this boundless green field. Here, sorghum grows to fourteen sections, higher than the eaves of high houses, with spikes more than a foot long, and sorghum rice as big as small pomegranate seeds. On average, each mu of land can yield about 300 jin. Some areas on the lakeside can yield 400 to 500 jin per mu. Millet grows very well, with spikes like wolf tails, emitting golden light.
　　At this time – early September, the Peace Propaganda Team of Pingyuan Province crossed the Yellow River and headed for the Huxi area. They beat waist drums everywhere and sang about the people's harvest. Day and night, they tirelessly explained the principles of defending peace to the people. Communist Party members, Youth League members, cooperative members, mutual aid group members, and organized masses from various people's organizations in the villages all participated in this work, mobilizing the masses to sign the peace declaration. In Li Lou Village, Juancheng, almost the entire village signed the declaration, and at every mealtime, the signing table was surrounded by people who couldn't move. No matter what the occasion, street or alley, market town or meeting place, peace signature books were placed everywhere.
　　A young farmer surnamed Li, waving his fist, told the propaganda team: "We love peace, we love production, but we have tough bones! We can't be slaves! The Japanese devils and the American running dog Chiang Kai-shek wanted to destroy us, but we defeated them! We are just about to have a good life, but the American kid is jealous and wants to start another big war, causing people all over the world to be separated from their wives and children. Let's all sign our names to show that we are united against this bad guy. If the bad guy really wants to fight, we will all beat him together! ..."
　　The propaganda team continued to move forward, and the people in the villages were stirred up by them like boiling water in a pot.
　　"Peace, you want to give peace to Chiang Kai-shek, I won't agree! I won't give up until Taiwan is taken!" An old man Zhang in Heze did not understand the meaning of signing and turned away angrily. Propagandist Xiao Doudou rushed up, smiled at the old man, and explained: "Grandpa! We didn't say we were going to talk about peace with Chiang Kai-shek! Chiang Kai-shek represents the forces of imperialism, and we must eliminate Chiang Kai-shek and his remnants completely. We are preparing sufficient strength to take Taiwan for sure. The peace we are talking about is against the imperialist war of aggression. The imperialists want to fight, but our people want peace and want to produce in peace. Oppose imperialism starting a war, everyone sign to oppose it, the more signatures the more power, and the imperialists will be afraid. If the imperialists insist on fighting, we will beat them together...." Xiao Doudou's mouth was foaming as he spoke. The old man smiled: "If you had said that earlier, I would approve with both hands! I sign for my son, grandson, and little daughter, the whole family."
　　The propaganda team continued to move forward, and the fat green castor leaves on both sides of the road covered the autumn sun.
　　When they arrived in Shan County, the masses of Shan County sang operas to welcome this group of peace warriors, and more than 10,000 people in front of the stage heard the principles of defending peace. An old man in the crowd indignantly recalled the crimes of Chiang's bandits against the people, saying: "I personally saw how inhuman the American imperialist running dog Chiang Kai-shek's gang was. In Chengnanzhuang, a ten-year-old child was interrogated by Chiang's bandits: "Where is the Eighth Route Army's stuff hidden?" The child shook his head and said, "I don't know." The enemy cut off the child's arm with a knife, and asked again, "Do you know now?" The child fell to the ground, struggling painfully, looking at his mother, and his mother said, "Good child, we won't be cowards!" The child bit his lip and shook his head again. Chiang's bandits then killed the child with two or three knives! The mother shouted: "If I have another child, I will still tell him to oppose the American devils and his running dogs!" Chiang's bandits cut off the mother's breasts, and the mother fainted. We will never forget this great hatred. Now, the running dogs of imperialism have been defeated by us, and the American devils want to come out in person again. I, an old man, will be the first to fight!"
　　The propaganda team arrived in Jinxiang County. In the evening, two films, "Entry Ceremony into Beiping" and "Democratic Northeast," were shown, and everyone cheered in unison when they saw our army: "This is the power to defend peace!" Then they saw the abundant autumn harvest in the Northeast, and many people applauded and cheered: "The rice ears are longer than ours here!" "The sorghum is taller than ours here!" "That's really Jinxiang!"
　　Jinxiang has a total population of 300,000, and it is estimated that 200,000 participated in the movement to sign in defense of peace. Some villages signed their names from door to door. A young man from one district said: "In the villages near us, we not only signed our names, but also took photos. We want to send the photos to the World Peace Congress to show our people: we have the determination and strength to oppose imperialism."
　　The propaganda team arrived in Yutai County. The east side of Yutai is lake water. The lake people are busy harvesting water caltrop, fox nuts, lotus seeds, and wild rice. White seagulls fly over the green bean fields by the lake. People are working peacefully and busily. But they still remember the bombing atrocities by American-made planes by the lake in 1947, and they all signed the peace defense signature book.
　　In Jiaxiang, which is widely planted with southern fragrant rice, in Lujiazhuang, Dashantou District, the vast majority of villagers signed their names. In addition, the Youth League members mobilized more than 100 passers-by on the village head to sign their names.
　　This propaganda team works in the abundant fields. They are like a torrent. Wherever they go, they set off a wave of enthusiasm for defending world peace. (September 21st in Juye)

　　平原省的和平宣传队
    田兵
    平原省黄河南岸，梁山泊、南阳湖的西岸，曾经是和敌人战斗最厉害的地区，多少年来，饱受战祸天灾。去年的大黄水，又使这一地区受灾很重，可是今年的大秋，已预定了十年未有的丰收。老农民松一口气说：“十年来的苦战，这才是好日子的开头！”在朝阳里，他们滚着喜悦的热泪，笑望着这无边的绿色原野。这儿，高粱长到十四节，比高房檐还高，穗子一尺多长，高粱米像小石榴籽那样大。平均每亩地可收到三百斤左右。湖畔有些地区每亩有收四五百斤的。谷子长的很好，穗子像狼尾巴一样，发着金黄的光。
    就在这时候——九月初旬，平原省和平宣传队渡过了黄河开向湖西专区。他们到处打着腰鼓，到处歌唱着人民的丰收。他们不分日夜，不倦地向人民解说着保卫和平的道理。各村里的共产党员、青年团员、合作社员，互助组员，各人民团体等有组织的群众，都参加了这一工作，发动群众在和平宣言上签名。鄄城李楼村，差不多全村都签了名，每到吃饭的时候，签名桌上就围着挤不动的人。不论在什么场合，街头或巷尾，集镇或会场，到处都放着保卫和平签名册。
    有一位姓李的青年农民，挥着拳头告诉宣传队说：“我们爱好和平，我们爱好生产，可是我们是硬骨头！我们不能当奴才！日本鬼子和美国走狗蒋介石想灭亡咱，被咱打败了！咱们刚要过好日子，美国小子又眼红，又想发动大战争，叫全世界的人都妻离子散。咱们大家都来签名，表示咱齐心反对这坏蛋，如坏蛋真的要打，咱就齐心揍他！……”
    宣传队继续朝前进，各村里的人民被他们鼓动得就像滚锅里的沸水。
    “和平，您要给蒋介石和平，我可不肯！不拿下台湾我死不干休！”荷泽的一位张老汉没有听明白签名的道理，愤怒的回头就走。宣传员小豆豆赶上去，向着老大爷笑着解释：“大爷！我们可没说给蒋介石讲和平呀！蒋介石是代表帝国主义势力的，我们一定要把蒋介石和他的余孽消灭净光。我们准备充足力量，一定拿下台湾来。我们说的和平，是反对帝国主义的侵略战争。帝国主义想打仗，咱们人民想和平，想安心生产。反对帝国主义发动战争，大家签上名反对，签的多了就是力量，帝国主义就害怕。如果帝国主义硬要打仗，咱就齐心揍他。……”小豆豆说的嘴角里冒着白沫。老大爷笑了：“早说这，我双手赞成！我代表儿子、孙子、小闺女，全家签名。”
    宣传队继续朝前进，路两旁肥绿的蓖麻叶，遮盖着秋天的太阳。
    到了单县，单县群众唱大戏欢迎这群和平战士，戏台前有一万多人听到了保卫和平的道理。人群里有一位老大爷忿慨地忆述蒋匪残害人民的罪行说：“我亲眼看见过美帝走狗蒋介石匪帮多么没有人性。在城南庄上，有一个十岁的孩子被蒋匪盘问：“八路军的东西藏到那里？”孩子摇头说：“不知道。”敌人一刀砍掉了孩子的胳膊，又问：“知道不知道？”孩子倒在地下，苦痛地挣扎着，看看他母亲，母亲说：“好孩子，咱们不当孬种！”孩子咬紧口唇再摇头。蒋匪接着两三刀，把孩子砍死了！母亲喊道：“我再有孩子，还叫他反对美国鬼子和他的走狗！”蒋匪割掉了母亲的乳房，母亲昏了过去。这种大仇恨我们永远忘不了。现在，帝国主义的走狗被我们打败了，美国鬼子又想亲自出马，我老汉，第一个要打！”
    宣传队到了金乡县。晚上，放映《北平入城式》和《民主东北》两套影片，大家看到我们的军队，齐声欢呼“这就是保卫和平的力量！”接着又看到丰收的东北大秋，多少人鼓掌欢呼：“比咱这里的谷穗还长呀！”“比咱这里的高粱还高呀！”“人家才真是金乡哩！”
    金乡共三十万人口，估计参加了保卫和平签名运动的有二十万。有些村庄是挨门挨户的签了名。一区的一位青年说：“我们附近几个庄，不光是签了名，我们还照了像。我们要把像片送到世界和平大会上展览，表示我们人民：反对帝国主义有决心，有力量。”
    宣传队到了鱼台县，鱼台东面是湖水。湖民正忙着收获菱芰、鸡头米、莲子、菰米。白色的海鸥在湖畔绿色的豆田上飞翔。人们安详而忙碌地工作着。可是他们还记得一九四七年，美制飞机在湖畔轰炸的暴行，他们一个个都在保卫和平签名册上签了名。
    遍植南方香稻的嘉祥，大山头区路家庄，绝大多数的村民都签了名。另外青年团员又在庄头上动员了过往的行人一百多人签名。
  这一支宣传队工作在丰收的田野上，他们像一股洪流，他们到那里，那里就掀起保卫世界和平的热潮。（九月二十一日在巨野）
