　　The people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union are watching the labor victories of the People's Republic of China with boundless joy. These victories confirm the great predictions of Lenin and Stalin, namely: that the people's power is capable of mobilizing and attracting the genius of hundreds of millions of people, who have been ravaged and trampled by capitalism for centuries, to build a new life. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Mao Zedong, the working people of China only needed a minimum of time to prove that they are better at managing state affairs than the exploiters. The People's Republic of China has only been established for a year, and what has been done in this year could not have been done by the oppressors in a hundred years.

　　It is understandable that the working people of China, who have power in their own hands, are now working for themselves, not for the wealthy. The powerful source of the people's political and labor enthusiasm is based on this. Such a high tide was impossible under the old system, because this system squeezed the blood and sweat of the people to enrich a few parasites and traitors.

　　The establishment of the People's regime in China has great international significance. It consolidates and strengthens the democratic and socialist camp worldwide, and at the same time heralds the collapse of the entire capitalist system. The greater the achievements of the working people of China in their creative work, the more consolidated the strength of democracy and socialism will be, and the more weakened the strength of capitalism will be.

　　In the great victory of the working people of the world against imperialist aggression and war, the firm alliance of friendship, mutual assistance between China and the Soviet Union plays a special role. The stronger this alliance, the more hope there is for the defense of world peace.

　　The American government's bandit-like attack on the People's Democratic Republic of Korea shows that American imperialism is carrying out this monstrous crime in order to seize world hegemony. It has already stolen some European countries, and now American imperialists are attempting to further expand their aggression. But the people of the world will not allow this. The fate of those American imperialists who dream of ruling the world will surely meet the same fate as that of German Hitler. The people of the world will judge them for all the crimes and disasters they have brought to mankind, and make them eat their own bitter fruit.

　　Only countries where the people themselves hold power can implement a truly peace-loving policy. For example, the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries of Eastern Europe. In these countries, great creative work is boiling, and this work is bringing increasing happiness to the working people. And this great creative labor is the invincible force of democracy and socialism.

　　In our Soviet country, a great work is now beginning, that is, to build two new grand power stations on the banks of the great Russian river Volga, and to open the Turkmen Main Canal in the desert area of Central Asia. Such great architecture has never been seen in human history. The completion of these buildings will greatly improve the power equipment of the Soviet Union and can irrigate more than 21 million hectares of the most fertile land.

　　The realization of these tasks is only possible under the conditions of the Soviet socialist victory.

　　We can see a high tide of creation in every Soviet enterprise. This is expressed in the powerful Stakhanov movement, which has become a nationwide movement in our country. Now our workers are striving to make every enterprise a Stakhanovite enterprise, that is to say, to enable anyone in the enterprise to complete his production quota. Therefore, huge education and organizational work is being carried out everywhere in our country. For example, our factory is already a collective Stakhanovite labor enterprise. All our workers not only complete but also over fulfill the production quota. The technician of our factory's machine workshop, Nikolai Rossisky, has become the leader and organizer of the collective Stakhanovite labor movement, and he has won the Stalin Prize for his achievements. Now thousands of Soviet enterprises are competing with each other for the glorious title of Stakhanovite enterprise. Many large enterprises in Moscow, such as the Second Bearing Factory, the Carbonization Machine Factory, and the Kuprovinsk Textile Factory, have won this title.

　　If the Stakhanovite work experience of Soviet workers can be used by Chinese workers in building their People's Republic, Soviet workers will be very happy.

　　We believe that the working people of the People's Republic of China will continue to consolidate their achievements with their selfless labor and strive for the prosperity of their motherland. (Moscow Special)

　　为什么苏联人民要为人民中国的成就欢欣鼓舞
    Ｂ·华西里也夫
    本文作者是一个斯达哈诺夫工作者，莫斯科“卡里伯尔”机械工厂的技工，斯大林奖金获得者。        
    ——编者
    苏联各族人民无限喜悦地注视着中华人民共和国的劳动的胜利。这些胜利，证实了列宁和斯大林的伟大预言，即：人民政权是能够发动并吸引被资本主义摧残与蹂躏了好几世纪的亿万人民的天才去建设新生活的。中国劳动人民在共产党与毛泽东领导下，只是需要一个最短时期，便能证明自己比剥削者更善于管理国事。中华人民共和国成立到现在仅仅只有一年，而这一年中所做的事情，是压迫者做一百年也不能做到的。
    这是可以理解的，在自己手里掌握了政权的中国劳动者，现在是为自己本身工作，而不是为那些财主们工作。人民群众政治上与劳动方面的积极性，其强大源泉即基于此。在旧制度下，是不可能有如此的高涨的，因为这种制度榨尽了人民的血汗，是为少数寄生虫和叛徒们发财致富的。
    中国人民政权的确立有着伟大的国际意义。它巩固并壮大了全世界民主与社会主义的阵营，同时预告着资本主义整个制度的崩溃。中国劳动人民在自己创造性工作中的成就愈大，那么民主与社会主义的力量将愈巩固，资本主义的力量也将愈削弱。
    在全世界劳动者反对帝国主义侵略和战争的伟大胜利中，中苏友好互助的坚固联盟起了特殊的作用。这个联盟愈坚固，全世界和平的保卫也就愈有希望。
    美国政府对人民民主朝鲜的强盗式的攻击，显示了美国帝国主义进行这一滔天的罪行，为的是想劫夺世界霸权。它已窃得了一些欧洲国家，现在美国帝国主义者们又企图更进一步地扩大它的侵略。但是全世界的人民是不容许这样的。那些幻想统治世界的美帝国主义者的命运，一定会遭遇到德国希特勒同样的命运。全世界人民，将因他们带给人类的一切罪恶与灾难，审判他们，叫他们自食其恶果。
    唯有人民自己掌握着政权的国家，才能够实现真正爱好和平的政策。例如苏联、中国及东南欧各人民民主国家。在这些国家内，伟大的创造性的工作在沸腾，这种工作正带给劳动者以日益增多的幸福。而这种伟大的创造性的劳动，就是不可战胜的民主与社会主义的力量。
    在我们苏维埃国家里，现在正在开始着巨大的工作，那就是在伟大的俄罗斯河流伏尔加河岸上建设两所新的宏大的发电站，和在中亚细亚沙漠地带开辟土库曼大运河。这样伟大的建筑在人类历史上是从未见过的。这些建筑的完成将大大提高苏联的电力装备，并可以灌溉二千一百多万公顷的最肥沃的土地。
    这些工作的实现，只有在苏联社会主义胜利的条件下，方才成为可能。
    我们在每一个苏维埃的企业中都可以看到创造的高涨。共表现即是强大的斯达哈诺夫运动，这个运动在我国已成为全民性的运动。现在我们的工人们都在努力争取使每个企业都成为斯达哈诺夫式的企业，即是说，要使各企业中任何一个人都能完成他的生产定额。因此，我国到处都在进行巨大的教育和组织工作。例如我们的工厂已经是集体的斯达哈诺夫式劳动的企业了。我们所有的工人不仅完成而且还超额完成生产定额。我们工厂里器械车间的技师尼古拉·罗西斯基便成为了集体斯达哈诺夫式劳动运动的带头者与组织者，他由于得到了成就而荣获了斯大林奖金。现在成千的苏维埃企业都在为获得斯达哈诺夫企业的光荣称号而互相竞赛着。莫斯科的许多大企业，如第二轴承工厂，炭化机工厂，库泊文斯克纺织工厂，都已获得了这个称号。
    如果苏维埃工人的斯达哈诺夫式的工作经验能被中国的劳动者在建设自己的人民共和国时利用的话，苏维埃工人们将十分高兴。
    我们相信，中华人民共和国的劳动者今后也将以自己的忘我劳动来巩固自己的成果，将为自己祖国的繁荣而奋斗。    （莫斯科特稿）
