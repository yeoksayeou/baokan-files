A Summary of the Work of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation Over the Past Year and the Main Tasks for This Winter and Next Spring
    ——A Summary of Cai Chang's Report at the Third Expanded Meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Women's Federation
    Overview of the Work Over the Past Year

    The work this year has advanced a step forward on the basis of the original work.
    Women's federations at all levels have worked hard to implement the policy of organizing women to participate in production as the central task, as decided by the First National Women's Congress. Women's federations in various cities have focused on the work of female workers, assisting the female workers' departments of trade unions in conducting ideological and cultural education among female workers, as well as childcare, maternal and child health, and other work; and have organized some poor working women to participate in handicraft production. In agriculture, women's federations at all levels have cooperated with local governments to mobilize and organize women to participate in spring plowing, summer hoeing, and autumn harvesting. In the old liberated areas, the participation of women in agricultural production has reached 50% to 70%; in the semi-old areas, it has reached 40%. Women's federations in disaster areas have focused on production for disaster relief.
    In terms of women's and children's welfare, the Women's Federation assisted the government in formulating the draft Marriage Law. After the official promulgation and implementation of the Marriage Law, the National Women's Federation used various methods to carry out publicity and education on the Marriage Law. Secondly, most local women's federations earnestly carried out childcare work, helping some female workers and staff members to solve the difficulties encountered in raising children while participating in production and work, and improving children's health. At present, there are 643 public and private childcare institutions across the country, caring for 31,794 children, an increase of more than five times compared to the number of nurseries before liberation. There are also 183 public and private children's education institutions, educating and raising 23,790 orphans and refugee children. In addition, women's federations in various regions have also done a lot of work in uniting medical personnel to publicize maternal and child health knowledge, transforming old midwives, and experimenting with maternal and child health stations.
    In terms of publicity and education, in order to meet the needs of the construction of the new China, the National Women's Federation published the article "Learn Skills and Do a Good Job" on the "March 8th" International Women's Day this year, calling on women cadres to strengthen their learning and improve their abilities. The first class of more than 350 students from the New China Women's Vocational School, sponsored by the National Women's Federation, has graduated and is now being expanded to train women cadres from working-class and peasant backgrounds, as well as female technicians. In addition, over the past year, internationalist education has been expanded through activities such as commemorating the "June 1st" International Children's Day and the signature campaign to defend world peace, and the New China Women's Monthly has been consistently edited and published.
    In terms of the organization of women, democratic women's federations or preparatory committees have now been established in 31 provinces, 83 cities, and 1,287 counties in the four major administrative regions, connecting more than 30 million women through various women's organizations. Over the past year, women's federations in most regions have successively established various types of urban and rural women's representative conferences, using this organizational form to broadly unite women and effectively promote work.
    In terms of international work, last year the National Women's Federation, entrusted by the International Democratic Women's Federation, convened the Asian Women's Representative Conference, which determined the direction and tasks of the Asian women's movement and encouraged the liberation struggles of Asian women. It has also sent people to attend the council and executive committee meetings of the International Women's Federation, as well as to participate in the Chinese People's Delegations celebrating the national days of Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and North Korea, using various possible opportunities to introduce to foreign countries the victory of the Chinese revolution and the heroic struggles of Chinese women.
  Main Tasks for This Winter and Next Spring
    In order to respond to Chairman Mao's call and work with the people of the whole country to strive for a fundamental improvement in the financial and economic situation, and to consolidate and develop the achievements made in women's work over the past year, we have decided on the following main tasks for women's work this winter and next spring:
    First, actively carry out women's work in areas implementing land reform: Women's federation cadres in these areas must actively participate in the preparatory work for local land reform, study the land reform policy and the Land Law in depth, and become familiar with the local women's situation. During land reform, local women's federations should adhere to the principle of mobilizing both men and women, overcome the idea of neglecting to mobilize women, absorb peasant women to participate in peasant associations or other relevant meetings, and select activists among women to participate in leadership work. Women's committees or commissions can be set up in peasant associations, and women's representative conferences or women's mass meetings can be convened to discuss women's participation in land reform. The principle of unified land distribution according to population should be followed to effectively guarantee women's land rights. In order to gain experience, women's federation cadres at all levels should earnestly participate in the work of land reform pilot areas. In areas where land reform is not implemented this winter, local women's federations should combine with the movement to eliminate bandits, oppose local bullies, and reduce rent to carry out women's work.
    Second, organizing and educating women to participate in various industrial and agricultural production should be the central task of women's federations at all levels. Cities should strengthen the production work of female workers, family members of employees, and working women according to different situations and conditions. The main methods for women's federations to lead women to participate in production are to cooperate with local governments, enterprises, trade unions, and cooperatives, focusing on removing ideological obstacles and practical difficulties for women to participate in production, and advocating and helping them to learn skills. Women's federations should actively assist relevant parties in organizing childcare, maternal and child health, cultural and technical education, and other work, and attach importance to organized education.
    In rural areas where land reform has been completed, mobilize women to participate in autumn harvesting, autumn planting, and winter sideline production in large numbers, and organize them to participate in mutual aid production groups on a voluntary basis in preparation for spring plowing next year. In the movement to establish and transform cooperatives, actively mobilize women to participate in cooperatives. In areas where land reform is being implemented, attention must be paid to combining land reform with production.
    Third, actively mobilize women to participate in the winter study movement and solve the difficulties that women must solve in learning. Combine the content of local winter study education with the special education for women (such as knowledge of women's liberation, the Marriage Law, and maternal and child health); select women cadres and activists in districts and villages with potential for cultivation to receive cultural education. For middle-aged women with family ties, use appropriate organizational forms and methods so that they can have the opportunity to learn. In places with regularized peasant spare-time schools or people's schools, a certain number of women who can persist in learning should be selected to enter the schools. To this end, responsible cadres for women's work in districts and villages should strive to participate in the leadership work of winter study education in districts and villages, and actively and proactively promote the work together.
    Fourth, continue to assist the judicial organs of governments at all levels, especially district and village governments, in implementing the Marriage Law. Women's federation cadres at all levels must first study the Marriage Law in depth, become familiar with it, and carry out publicity and explanation of the Marriage Law among the masses in a planned manner. They have the responsibility to put forward their own suggestions and amendments to the deviations and incorrect ideas of the government in implementing the Marriage Law. In areas where land reform has not yet been carried out and the masses have not yet been mobilized, the level of awareness of the masses should be taken into account when implementing the Marriage Law, and it should not be rushed. At present, publicity work on the Marriage Law should be carried out to prepare the conditions for gradual implementation. In women's federations in multi-ethnic areas, they should assist the Great Administrative Region and the Provincial People's Government in formulating supplementary provisions to the Marriage Law suitable for local conditions where possible.
    Fifth, continue to carry out the movement to defend world peace and strengthen international publicity and liaison work. In the future, the National Women's Federation should strengthen its ties with the International Women's Federation and the democratic women's movements in Southeast Asian countries. Women's federations at all levels should provide materials, offer opinions, and assist in the progress of this work in all aspects. Cadres of women's federations at all levels should study international knowledge, care about the international women's movement, and widely carry out internationalist publicity and education among women.
    In order to accomplish the above tasks, it is necessary to strengthen the unity of women of all nationalities, strata, democratic parties, non-party democratic women, and all patriotic women, establish women's representative conferences more universally, broadly connect with women, and improve cadres, learn skills, and do a good job.

　　中华全国民主妇女联合会一年来的工作概况及今冬明春的主要工作任务
    ——蔡畅在全国妇联第三次执委扩大会上的报告摘要
    一年来的工作概况
    这一年来的工作，在过去原有的工作基础上前进了一步。
    各地妇联在工作中努力执行了中国妇女第一次代表大会决定的以组织妇女参加生产为中心的方针。各城市妇联，以女工工作为重点，协助工会女工部在女工中进行了思想和文化的教育，以及保育儿童，妇幼卫生等工作；并组织了一部分贫苦劳动妇女参加手工业生产。农业方面，各地妇联配合当地政府，发动和组织妇女参加了春耕夏锄和秋收。老解放区妇女参加农业生产的已达百分之五十到七十；半老区也达到百分之四十。灾区妇联则以生产救灾为中心工作。
    在妇女儿童福利事业方面，妇联协助政府制定了婚姻法草案。在婚姻法正式颁布施行后，全国妇联又通过各种方法进行了婚姻法的宣传教育工作。其次，大部分地方妇联认真地开展了儿童保育工作。帮助一部分女工和女职员解除了在参加生产工作中所遇到的抚育孩子的困难，并增进了儿童的健康。现在全国各地共有各种公、私立的保育机构六百四十三所，受托儿童三万一千七百九十四人，比解放前全国原有托儿所增加了五倍以上。另有公、私立儿童教育机关一百八十三所，教养孤儿及难童二万三千七百九十人。此外，各地妇联在团结医务人员宣传妇幼卫生常识，改造旧产婆和试办妇幼卫生站等方面，也做了不少工作。
    在宣传教育工作方面，为了适应新中国建设事业的需要，全国妇联在今年“三八”节发表了“学会本领做好工作”的论文，号召妇女干部们加强学习，提高能力。全国妇联主办的新中国妇女职业学校，第一届三百五十余学生已毕业，现正加以扩充，以培养妇女工作及工农出身的女干部为主，兼训练女技术人员。此外，一年来通过纪念“六一”国际儿童节及保卫世界和平的签名运动等扩大了国际主义的教育，并坚持编辑和出版了新中国妇女月刊。
    在妇女群众的组织方面，现在已有四大行政区的三十一个省，八十三个市，一千二百八十七个县建立了民主妇女联合会或筹备委员会，通过各种妇女群众的组织，联系了妇女三千余万人。一年来大部分地区的妇联已先后建立了各种各样的城乡妇女代表会议，利用这种组织形式广泛地团结了妇女群众和有效地推进了工作。
    在国际工作方面，去年全国妇联受国际民主妇联的委托，召开了亚洲妇女代表会议，决定了亚洲妇运的方针和任务，鼓励了亚洲妇女的解放斗争。并先后派人出席国际妇联的理事会和执委会议，以及参加庆祝匈牙利、捷克、朝鲜国庆的中国人民代表团，利用各种可能的机会向国外介绍中国革命胜利和中国妇女英勇斗争的情况和经验。
  今冬明春的主要工作任务
    为着响应毛主席的号召，与全国人民一起努力争取财政经济的基本好转，并巩固和发展一年来妇女工作已得的成绩，我们决定了今冬明春妇女工作的几个主要任务如下：
    第一，积极开展实行土地改革地区的妇女工作：这些地区的妇联干部必须积极参加当地土地改革的准备工作，深入学习土地改革政策和土地法，熟习当地妇女情况。在进行土地改革时，当地妇联坚持贯彻男女一齐发动的方针，克服忽视发动妇女的思想，吸收农民妇女参加农民协会或其他有关会议，选拔妇女中的积极分子参加领导工作。在农民协会中可设妇女委员或委员会，召开妇女代表会议或妇女群众大会讨论妇女参加土地改革问题。要按人口统一分配土地的原则，确实有效地保障妇女土地权。为了取得经验，各地妇联干部，应认真参加土地改革典型试验区的工作。今冬不实行土地改革的地区，当地妇联应与清匪、反恶霸和减租运动相结合，开展妇女工作。
    第二，以组织教育妇女参加各种工业和农业生产为各级妇联中心任务。各城市应按不同情况和条件，加强女工、员工家属和劳动妇女的生产工作。妇联领导妇女参加生产的工作方法，主要是和当地政府、企业、工会、合作社配合进行，着重在解除妇女参加生产的思想障碍和实际困难，提倡和帮助她们学习技术。妇联应积极帮助有关方面举办儿童保育、妇幼卫生和文化教育、技术教育等工作，并重视组织起来的教育。
    在土地改革已完成地区的农村，大量动员妇女参加秋收、秋耕和冬季副业生产，在自愿的条件下组织她们参加生产互助小组，准备明年春耕。在建立和改造合作社运动中，要积极动员妇女参加合作社。正在实行土地改革的地区，必须注意在土地改革中结合生产。
    第三，积极动员妇女参加冬学运动，解决妇女在学习中必须解决的困难。配合当地冬学教育的内容，进行妇女的特殊教育（如妇女解放、婚姻法、妇幼卫生等知识）；选拔有培养前途的区村女干部和女积极分子受文化教育。对于有家庭牵连的中年妇女，应用适当的组织形式和方法，使她们能获得学习的机会。在有正规化的农民业余学校或民校的地方应选择一定数量的，可能坚持学习的妇女入校。为此，区、村妇女工作负责干部，应争取参加区、村冬学教育的领导工作，主动积极地协同推进工作。
    第四，继续协助各级政府的司法机关，特别是区、村政府贯彻执行婚姻法。各地妇联干部首先要深入学习，熟习婚姻法，有计划地在群众中进行婚姻法的宣传解释工作，对政府在执行婚姻法中的偏差和不正确思想，有责任提出自己的建议和修正意见。在土地改革尚未进行，群众尚未发动的地区，执行婚姻法时要估计到群众的觉悟程度，不可操之过急，目前应进行婚姻法的宣传工作，准备逐渐实行的条件。在多民族地区的妇联，应协助大行政区及省人民政府，在可能条件下制订适合当地情况的婚姻法的补充规定。
    第五，继续开展保卫世界和平运动，加强国际宣传和联络工作。今后全国妇联应加强与国际妇联及东南亚各国民主妇女运动的联系，各地妇联应供给材料，提供意见，并从各方面协助此项工作的进行。各级妇联干部均应学习国际知识，关心国际妇女运动，并在妇女群众中，广泛开展国际主义的宣传教育。
    为了完成上述任务，必须加强各民族、各阶层、各民主党派妇女、无党无派的民主妇女及一切爱国妇女的团结，更普遍地建立妇女代表会议，广泛联系妇女群众，并提高干部，学习本领，做好工作。
