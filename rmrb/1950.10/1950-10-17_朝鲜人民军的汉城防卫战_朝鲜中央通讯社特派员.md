　　The Korean People's Army's Defense of Seoul
    Special Correspondent of the Korean Central News Agency
    (I)
    The American troops invading the Yongsan area, under the cover of tanks and airplanes, attacked the ×× unit of the Beixi Shu (transliteration) detachment, and the Choi Dong-hak heavy machine gun squad, which were resolutely defending the South Gate.

    The fighters of the Choi Dong-hak heavy machine gun squad built an iron-clad defense line at the South Gate. On the evening of the 25th, they received a mobilization order from the unit commander: "The time has come to dedicate ourselves to defending the capital of the motherland against the invasion of the enemy! Mobilize all firepower to thwart the enemy's invasion! Uphold the glorious tradition of the People's Army!"

    The commander's mobilization order further boosted the squad's morale to annihilate the enemy.

    Around noon, the enemy in the Yongsan area launched a fierce barrage of artillery fire. Enemy shells rained down on the trenches around the Choi Dong-hak heavy machine gun squad's position. The squad fighters repeatedly recited the commander's mobilization order in the trenches, where the smoke made it impossible to see even a foot away.

    The enemy's shelling continued for four hours.

    When the shelling stopped at night, the squad fighters repaired the trenches destroyed by the enemy until dawn on the 26th. As soon as it was light, four enemy tanks were spotted approaching the South Gate from in front of Seoul Station, followed by about three companies of enemy infantry. The time for the decisive battle had arrived. The fighters of the Choi Dong-hak heavy machine gun squad were full of fighting spirit, organized a 36-man assault group to destroy the enemy tanks, and quickly organized a fire support group and a medical aid group. As the enemy tanks approached, firing their tank guns, the time for the assault came. The 36-man assault group, led by squad leader Choi Dong-hak, rushed out of the trenches and threw anti-tank grenades at the enemy from five meters away. The lead tank was engulfed in flames, and the second tank also stopped, emitting black smoke from its turret. The remaining two tanks avoided the assault group and turned back. The enemy infantry attacked the assault group in close combat, attempting to encircle them. But the assault group quickly ran into the empty houses on the side of the road. At that moment, the heavy machine guns of our army's position opened a fierce barrage, and the grenades thrown by the assault group members who had jumped into the empty houses exploded in the midst of the concentrated enemy troops.

    The enemy screamed. The advance of the enemy infantry, under the cover of tanks, was thwarted by the fierce and concentrated fire of our army's heavy machine guns, and they retreated in disorder. The accurate shots of the heavy machine guns struck the backs of the fleeing enemies. The sun rose, illuminating the smoke-filled streets of Seoul. The bodies of the hideous enemy were scattered on the wide roads of South Gate Street and Seoul Station.

    Looking at the two tanks that were still burning, the trenches and bunkers resolutely defending Seoul were filled with boiling cheers. The solemn sound of "Long live!" echoed from the People's Army warriors.

    (II)
    The fighters of the Korean People's Army and the heroic citizens of Seoul united together in the sea of fire and bravely repelled the enemy's attack.

    The tall buildings on both sides of the wide streets in the center of Seoul were engulfed in flames, and under the light as bright as day, a string of detestable enemy tanks drove in.

    An enemy heavy artillery shell landed on a corner of our army's bunker and exploded. A young student in uniform picked up a rifle and fiercely fired at the hateful enemy, shouting "Long live the People's Republic!" before falling. Under the storm of enemy bullets, a brave member of the Women's League carrying shells picked up the fallen student, pulled the rifle from the tightly clenched hand of the dead student, and fired at the enemy, shooting out bullets of revenge.

    The enemy's tank proudly spitting flames approached. At this moment, a young warrior of the People's Army shouted "Long live!" and rushed towards the enemy tank with a grenade and an incendiary bottle in his hands. In an instant, along with the shattering explosion, the hateful enemy tank began to emit fire, and the enemy infantry following behind the tank scurried around cowardly.

    The People's Army warriors picked up bayonets, threw grenades, and charged out of the bunkers into the midst of the enemy, engaging in bayonet after bayonet, a melee. Everywhere echoed the screams of the last struggling enemies, and the enemy's attack was repelled. Thus, this bunker was held.

    (III)
    The defense battle of the capital Seoul was actually a continuous and fierce bloody battle. Fighting continued for long periods over a single bunker, a single house, and a single street. In the intense crossfire, tanks and machine guns roared, and People's Army fighters engaged the enemy in fierce grenade battles across a single bunker.

    The enemy's blindly fired shells burned houses, and flames soared into the sky. The sound of tidal wave-like close combat cries echoed in every smoke-filled alley.

    The enemy stopped covering fire at 3:00 PM. The enemy ground troops began to attack under the aerial reconnaissance of six aircraft. Our army had no chance to fire into the air. The enemy aircraft repeatedly made low-altitude flights, approaching the heights and hills to reconnoiter the People's Army's defense situation and to continue supplying their ground troops.

    It was very disadvantageous for the People's Army's battle situation to be discovered by the enemy one by one. The hatred of the company fighters for the enemy aircraft rose to the extreme, and they could no longer endure the enemy aircraft's indiscriminate bombing.

    The fighters in the trenches requested anti-aircraft fire. Deputy Company Commander Li Shengwu decided to launch anti-aircraft fire. After issuing the order "Prepare for anti-aircraft fire," the company fighters aimed heavy machine guns, light machine guns, rifles, and other weapons at the air. The enemy aircraft continued to fly low along the heights and hills. "Concentrate fire on the second enemy aircraft!" The enemy's six aircraft were in a vertical formation, conducting their fifth reconnaissance. At the instant the nose of the plane turned back, the Deputy Company Commander gave the order to fire, and at the same time as the sound of the volley, hundreds of bullets were fired at the enemy aircraft.

    The company fighters fired while holding their breath. The tail of the enemy reconnaissance aircraft emitted a long trail of black smoke. "Long live!" The fighters burst into cheers unconsciously. The body of the aircraft was engulfed in flames, and burned on the high ground after not flying far. The panicked remaining reconnaissance aircraft fled in disarray.

    The muzzles of the company fighters aiming at the sky turned to the ground again, and began to fire fiercely at the enemy's ground troops. Firing and firing again, the barrels of the guns became red hot. In the face of the hatred and indignation fired from the guns, the enemy's fifth attempt to counterattack failed.
                  (Wu Kuitai)
    (IV)
    The Han Xiangyun (transliteration) detachment was in a difficult situation, with the ×× height it was resolutely defending surrounded by the enemy on three sides in a harsh defensive battle. The telephone line to the detachment headquarters could not be repaired either.

    From the beginning of the battle, the telephone squad risked their lives to repair the telephone line, which was the lifeline of combat operations, regardless of the dense artillery fire and light and heavy machine gun fire. But at this time, due to the enemy's continuous and frantic attacks, there was no way to repair it.

    The entire squad of fighters had no choice but to break through with the infantry to connect the telephone line. Under the cover of airplanes and artillery, the enemy was shrinking the encirclement, following behind the tanks, moment by moment. The Li Hongguo telephone squad fighters waited for the squad leader's order. Squad Leader Li Hongguo issued the order "Prepare to charge!" The fighters hiding in the trenches rushed into the enemy ranks like enraged lions.

    The bodies of the enemies were piled up like mountains, and they continued to charge over the bodies. The enemies, in their final struggle, frantically threw grenades, at a distance of no more than twenty meters. Before the grenades thrown by the enemy exploded, all the fighters, including Squad Leader Li Hongguo, picked up the grenades thrown by the enemy and quickly threw them back at the enemy. These enemy grenades all exploded on the heads of the enemies.

    The enemies fell one after another. Close combat continued for hours. The enemies finally retreated under our army's attack, and our army held the ×× height to the end.

    Under the bloody assault of the Li Hongguo telephone squad fighters, the telephone line to the detachment headquarters was restored, and our army's operations were victoriously protected.

　　朝鲜人民军的汉城防卫战
    朝鲜中央通讯社特派员
    （一）
    进犯龙山方面的美军部队在坦克和飞机的掩护下，向坚决保卫南大门的××部队贝希书（译音）区分队，崔东鹤重机枪小队进攻。
    崔东鹤重机枪小队战斗员们在南大门构筑了铁桶般的防御线。他们在二十五日晚收到了部队长的号召文：“在仇敌们的侵害下为保卫祖国首都献身的时候来到了，动员全部的火力挫败敌人的进犯吧！坚守人民军的光荣传统！”
    部队长的号召文更提高了小队战斗员灭敌的士气。
    过中午的时候，龙山方面的敌人，展开了炮兵部队的猛烈的掩护射击。敌人的炮弹降雨般的落在崔东鹤重机枪小队布置的阵地周围战壕。小队战斗员们在弥漫着硝烟不能瞧见咫尺的战壕里反复背读刚收到的部队长的号召文。
    敌人的炮击继续了四小时。
    到夜晚炮击停下了，小队战斗员修理被敌人破坏的战壕一直到二十六日的拂晓。天刚亮，发现了经过汉城车站前面向南大门开来的敌人坦克四辆，约有三个中队的敌军步兵部队跟着坦克后面攻进。决战的时候到来了。崔东鹤重机枪小队战斗员充满了斗志，为击破敌坦克组织了三十六名的突击组，同时很快的组织了火力组和救护组。敌坦克开着坦克炮接近，突击的时候来到了。崔东鹤小队长指挥的三十六名突击组，冲出战壕到敌人面前五公尺投出去反坦克手榴弹。前面的坦克被火焰围住了，第二个坦克也停止前进，从炮塔上吐出黑烟。剩下的两辆坦克避开突击组转回了方向。敌人步兵部队向突击组肉搏，企图包围突击组。但突击组迅速的跑进了路旁的空房。就在这一瞬间，我军阵地重机枪开始了猛烈的一齐射击，跳进空房里的突击组员们所投掷的手榴弹在集中的敌军部队当中爆炸了。
    敌人发出了惨叫。在坦克掩护下的敌步兵部队的进攻，被我军重机枪的猛烈集中射击所挫败，无秩序的全部后退了。重机枪的命中弹向逃跑的敌人背腰上一齐射击着。太阳升起来，照耀着硝烟弥漫的汉城街道。南大门大街和汉城车站宽阔的马路上，散着丑恶的敌人尸体。
    了望着到现在还在燃烧的两辆坦克，坚决防卫汉城的战壕和碉堡里充满沸腾的欢呼。人民军勇士们的高呼传来了庄严的万岁声。

    （二）
    朝鲜人民军的战斗员和英勇的汉城市民，在火海中团结一起，勇敢的击退仇敌的突击。
    汉城中心宽阔街路两旁的高层楼房都变成火海，像白天那么亮的火光下，可憎的敌军坦克一连串的开进来了。
    敌人的重炮弹落在我军碉堡一角上爆发了，穿着制服的青年学生端起步枪向憎恶的仇敌猛烈开火，高喊着“人民共和国万岁！”倒下去了。在暴风骤雨般的敌弹下，勇敢搬运炮弹的妇女同盟盟员，抱起倒下的学生，从死去的学生紧紧握着的手里，拔出步枪，向仇敌开火，射出报仇的枪弹。
    敌人的坦克骄傲地吐着火焰向这里走近了。这时候，人民军一个年青的勇士，高呼“万岁！”握着手榴弹和引火瓶向敌坦克冲进去了，瞬间与震裂的爆发声音同时，可憎的敌坦克开始冒起火来了，跟在坦克后面的敌步兵们怯懦的乱窜着。
    人民军勇士们端起刺刀，投掷手榴弹，超过碉堡冲进敌人的中间，展开了刺杀又刺杀的肉搏战。各处都响起了最后挣扎的仇敌们的惨叫声，仇敌的突击被击退了。这样坚守住了这一碉堡。
                  （吴奎泰）
    （三）
    首都汉城防卫战斗实际上是个激烈血战的连续。一个碉堡、一栋房屋、一条街道上都继续着许多时间的战斗。在交叉猛烈的集中炮火里，坦克和机枪咆哮着，隔着一个碉堡人民军战斗员与敌人展开激烈的手榴弹战。
    敌人盲目射击的炮弹，燃烧着房屋，火焰冲天。在硝烟弥漫的每条巷间，传来潮水般的肉搏战的呼喊声。
    到午后三点钟敌人才停止掩护射击。敌人地上部队在六架飞机空中侦查下，开始进攻。我军没有向空中射击的机会。敌机进行反复低空飞行，接近高地和丘陵，侦查人民军的守卫情况，继续供给其地上部队。
    人民军战斗情况被敌人一个个发现是很不利的，中队战斗员对敌机的憎恶心极度的高涨起来，再也忍不住敌机的滥炸了。
    在战壕里的战斗员们要求对空射击，李圣武副中队长决定了对空射击，下了“对空射击准备”的命令后，中队战斗员将重机轻机，步枪等各种武器一齐对空瞄准。敌机继续沿高地丘陵作低空飞行。“向敌第二机集中射击！”敌六架飞机作纵队，进行第五次的侦查，机首转回飞行的瞬间，副中队长下了射击命令，与一齐射击的枪声同时，数百发枪弹向敌机射出去了。
    中队战斗员们压着呼吸射起来了，敌侦察机尾巴冒起了很长的黑烟。“万岁！”战斗员们不知不觉的爆发了欢呼声。机体被火焰包着，没飞多少路就在高地上烧掉了。仓惶的残余侦察机随着逃走了。
    向着天空的中队战斗员们的炮口再度转向地上，开始向敌人地上部队一齐猛烈的射击。射击又射击，枪身成了火块，在射出去的憎恶和激愤的枪弹面前，敌人第五次反突击的企图失败了。

    （四）
    韩相云（译音）区分队，以苛烈的防御战，坚守的××高地被敌人三面包围，陷入困难的环境。通到区分队指挥部的电话线也不能修理了。
    电话小队从战斗开始，就为保证作为战斗行动上的动脉的电话联络，不顾密集的各种炮弹和轻重机枪的射击，献出生命修理着电话线。但是这时候由于敌人连续的疯狂攻击，毫无办法去修理。
    全体小队战斗员只好同步兵一起，进行突围连络电话线。在飞机和大炮掩护下，敌人跟在坦克后面一刻比一刻缩小包围圈。李弘国电话小队战斗员们等待小队长命令，李弘国小队长下了“准备冲锋！”的命令，在壕内隐蔽的战士们如激怒的狮子般突入敌人队伍。
    仇敌们的尸体堆积如山，越过尸体继续冲锋。最后挣扎的仇敌们，疯狂的投手榴弹，距离不过二十公尺。敌人投过来的手榴弹未爆发前，李弘国小队长以下全体战斗员们，把敌人投过来的手榴弹拾起来很快的再向敌人投过去。这些敌人的手榴弹都在仇敌们头上炸了。
    敌人接连的倒下去，肉搏战不知连续了几个钟头。仇敌们在我军突击下终于后退，我军始终坚守了××高地。
    在李弘国电话小队战斗员们血的突击下，恢复了通到区分队指挥部的电话线，胜利的保卫了我军作战。
