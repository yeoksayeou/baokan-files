　　Xinhua News Agency, Oslo, 8th: The Oslo branch of the Norwegian Federation of the Women's International Democratic Federation has issued an open letter to the Norwegian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly and the Norwegian representative to the Security Council, expressing "their deep regret for the behavior of the Norwegian representative attending the United Nations Security Council on the issue of resolving the Korean conflict." The letter states: "This behavior damages the cause of peace and the prestige of the United Nations. Norway, which has always been considered a small country that loves peace, has appeared as a country that supports and even intervenes militarily in the internal affairs of other countries without first taking all the methods stipulated in the United Nations Charter.

    We women and mothers believe that the struggle to prevent a new world war is our supreme responsibility. We hear the suffering of Korean civilians—women, children, and the elderly—suffering caused by the war that our representatives are supporting. We therefore firmly urge our representatives to the Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly to support proposals to resolve the Korean conflict by immediately ceasing the war and withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea so that the Korean people can decide their own destiny in peace."

　　挪威妇女要求联大挪威代表
    支持和平解决朝鲜问题建议
    【新华社讯】塔斯社奥斯陆八日电：世界民主妇女联合会挪威分会奥斯陆支会顷发表致联合国大会挪威代表团与安全理事会挪威代表的公开信，表示“她们对于挪威出席联合国安全理事会的代表对解决朝鲜冲突问题所表现的行为的深切遗憾。”信中说：“这种行为损害了和平事业与联合国的威信。一向被认为是一个爱好和平的小国的挪威，竟以一个拥护甚至事先毫不采取联合国宪章所规定的一切方法便武装干涉他国内政的国家的姿态出现了。
    我们妇女与母亲们认为：为防止新世界战争而斗争，乃是我们无上的责任。我们听到朝鲜平民——妇女、儿童与老人——所受到的苦难，而这些苦难正是因为我国代表所拥护的那个战争才会有的。我们因此坚决主张我国出席安全理事会与联合国大会的代表支持通过立即停止战争、所有外国军队自朝鲜撤退以便朝鲜人民能够在和平的状况下决定他们命运的方法来解决朝鲜冲突的建议。”
