　　Northwest Administrative Region First-Level Rectification Second Stage Ends
    Major Problems Solved Through Work Inspection
    Now Entering Third Stage for Personal Ideological Summary
    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Xi'an Masses Daily news: After a month of checking work, analyzing the situation, and discussing problems, the second stage of the first-level rectification movement in the Northwest Administrative Region (i.e., the problem-solving stage, which is also the main stage of the rectification movement) has basically ended. Most agencies are now conducting personal ideological summaries and summarizing the entire rectification movement. This is the third stage of the rectification movement.

    During the second stage of rectification, most agencies were able to address the main problems within their respective units by inspecting work, according to the specific circumstances of their unit. As a result, cadres' thinking has been elevated to a certain extent, leadership style has begun to change, and work has been improved. This stage has seen significant gains.

    The Northwest Ministry of Civil Affairs mainly solved the major problems of the ministry by checking on production and disaster relief work. In terms of leadership thought and style, the ideological method of empiricism and the leadership method of bureaucracy were deeply exposed. The summary of production and disaster relief work showed that: (1) There was a distance between the leadership's requirements and the actual situation (i.e., the conditions of the cadres and the materials available). Leading cadres, starting from subjective wishes, demanded that everything be summarized perfectly, and it would not be acceptable if anything was missing. (2) Not enough regular, planned study of policies and familiarity with business was carried out. For example, the State Council's instructions on production and disaster relief were not discussed; the views of leaders at all levels within the ministry were inconsistent, leaving subordinates at a loss. (3) Not enough collective research was done. The leadership did not study some problems in advance, could not grasp the situation, and sometimes came up with ideas based on feelings, which were naturally difficult to be pertinent. (4) Not enough regular supervision and inspection were carried out. Usually, necessary materials were not collected, the leadership was unaware of the situation, and when things came up, there would be temporary crash efforts and total mobilization, making it difficult to do a good job. Minister Wang Ziyi reviewed his old-fashioned leadership methods of empiricism: "In the past, when I worked in the Civil Affairs Department of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, I had been to almost all of the twenty-three counties in the border region, and I knew some things without investigation. But today, I am facing the entire Northwest's two hundred and some counties, and I have not grasped many situations. The Civil Affairs Department of the Border Region had a dozen or so cadres, and the leadership was familiar with the situation of each cadre, and it was easy for the subordinates to understand the intentions of the leadership, and some things were done as soon as they were said. But today, there are over a hundred people, and many new comrades have joined the work. They are not very familiar with the business, and they still need to improve their understanding of policies; at this time, we should help them become familiar with the business and study policies, and the requirements for them should be different. But the leadership still used the old set of leadership methods." In terms of the work system, the main problem exposed by the inspection of production and disaster relief was the lack of clear division of labor: the responsibilities between the ministry and the departments, between the departments and the offices, between the departments, and between the departments and the sections were not clear, and it was impossible to give play to everyone's enthusiasm. In addition, the official document procedures were cumbersome and the processing was slow. Based on the above situation, the work of the Ministry of Civil Affairs has begun to be improved as follows. The first is to strengthen learning and research. Now the Civil Affairs Department has been studying the land reform policy and relevant documents on political construction; the Social Affairs Department has been studying rent reduction and relief for the unemployed and other policies and documents. In addition, it was decided that in the future, when writing summaries and instructions, they must be collectively discussed in advance, with specific guidance from responsible comrades, and then written by one person. In terms of official document processing, a collective office system has been established. Documents received at 12 noon can reach the hands of the drafter at 2 pm. In the past, a simple letter would take one to two days to process; now a reply can be issued in one and a half days. Regarding the division of labor of the entire ministry, a special group has drafted a system, which has been announced at the conference, and everyone is now discussing it and will formulate detailed rules for each department based on everyone's opinions. This process of review and improvement has inspired and encouraged the comrades below. After some leading comrades conducted self-criticism, the comrades below also automatically conducted self-criticism. Some people said that it is not enough to rectify only the locomotive (leadership), but also the carriages (subordinates), otherwise, if only the locomotive runs and the carriages do not move, it will not work. Some people also announced at the meeting that they would formulate a work plan. Because the leadership has begun to improve, some people feel that there is "a way forward" for future work and have increased their confidence in their work.

    The Northwest Branch of the Supreme People's Court has improved in terms of policy and ideology. The branch specifically reviewed major typical cases that had been handled, exposing deviations in the implementation of policies. For example, when the Criminal Court was reviewing a bandit case in Xi'an, the main culprit was a counter-revolutionary special agent who shot and killed one person during the robbery. The court at that time emphasized that the culprit had handed in a gun once and that the main purpose was robbery, not murder, and ignored that he was an incorrigible counter-revolutionary element. Therefore, the culprit was only sentenced to ten years in prison. After this review, it was considered that this was not a correct grasp of the policy of combining suppression and leniency, but a deviation towards excessive leniency. Now the branch has instructed the Xi'an People's Court to re-handle this case. At the same time, it was found that in some prisons in the Northwest, there were also deviations in the implementation of the policy of combining punishment and education, that is, the role of education was overemphasized. Even the erroneous slogan of "education as the main, leniency as the principle" was put forward. These deviations occurred at the lower levels were related to the lack of clarity in the leadership's thinking of the branch. After this review, the branch had a further clear understanding ideologically. The Civil Court found that in the past, when adjudicating cases, they often only judged the case as it was, and finished the case, regardless of whether the problem was solved and what the effect was. After the review, it was proposed that in the future, when hearing cases, they should adopt a highly responsible attitude towards the people, conduct in-depth investigation and research, and patiently explain policies. The branch's various departments have formulated systems for improving work based on the findings of the inspection. The leadership has also begun to actively inspect the work of the lower levels, changing the past practice of not moving unless ordered by the higher levels.

    The central problem of the General Office of the Military and Political Committee was the low efficiency in handling official documents. In this regard, four issues were mainly resolved: First, the issue of a responsible attitude. In the future, when handling official documents, it is necessary to carefully analyze the nature of the documents and how to solve the problems, so that the documents can truly have the intended effect. Second, it is necessary to distinguish between the important and the urgent, determine the order of priority, and handle them in order. Third, it is necessary to have a global perspective: some official documents are distributed to the relevant departments for handling, and the situation and difficulties of the department should be estimated, and assistance should be given as much as possible; after the documents are distributed, they should be promptly supervised. Fourth, based on the results of the review, necessary systems have been formulated.

    During the problem-solving stage, a few agencies, because of the leadership's slackness, or because the problems that the leadership wanted to solve were not combined with the opinions of the broad masses, resulting in a disconnect between the upper and lower levels, the inspection work could not be carried out in depth, and the results were not great.

### 西北大行政区一级整风第二阶段结束  通过检查工作解决主要问题  现已进入第三阶段进行个人思想总结

　　西北大行政区一级整风第二阶段结束
    通过检查工作解决主要问题
    现已进入第三阶段进行个人思想总结
    【本报讯】据西安群众日报消息：经过一月来的检查工作，分析情况，讨论问题，西北大行政区一级整风运动第二阶段（即解决问题的阶段，也即整风运动的主要阶段），已经基本结束。现在多数机关都在进行个人思想总结并总结整个整风运动。这是整风运动的第三阶段。
    在整风第二阶段中，多数机关都能按照本单位的具体情况，通过检查工作，大体上解决了本单位存在的主要问题。从而使干部思想有了一定程度的提高，领导作风开始有了转变，工作方面有了改进。这一阶段是有明显的收获的。
    西北民政部，主要是通过检查生产救灾工作，来解决该部的主要问题。在领导思想、作风上，比较深刻的揭发了经验主义的思想方法和官僚主义的领导方法。在总结生产救灾工作中就表现出：（一）领导要求和实际情况（即干部条件和占有的材料等）有距离。领导干部从主观愿望出发，要求把所有的东西都总结出来，并且十全十美，差一样就不行。（二）经常地、有计划地研究政策、熟悉业务作得不够，如政务院关于生产救灾的指示，就没有讨论过；部内各级领导对问题的看法不一致，下边无所适从。（三）集体研究不够，对有些问题领导上没有事先研究，不能掌握情况，有时凭感想出主意，自然很难中肯。（四）经常的督促检查不够，平常没有汇集必要的材料，领导上心中无数，事情来了就临时突击，全体动员，很难搞好。王子宜部长曾检讨了自己经验主义的老一套的领导方法：“过去在陕甘宁边区民政厅工作，边区二十三个县自己差不多都去过，有些事情不用调查也可以知道。但是今天面临的是整个西北的二百几十个县，而好多情况却没有掌握。边区民政厅有十几个干部，领导上熟悉每个干部的情况，下边也容易了解领导的意图，有些事情一说就办了。但是今天成了一百几十人了，很多新同志参加了工作，他们业务上不太熟悉，政策上还需要提高；这时就应该帮助他们熟悉业务，研究政策，对他们的要求有所不同。但是领导上却还是用了旧的一套领导方法。”在工作制度方面，检查生产救灾所暴露的主要问题是分工不明：部和处、处和办公室、各处中间、处和科中间，职责不清，不能发挥大家的积极性。另外是公文手续繁琐，处理迟慢。根据上述情况，民政部的工作已开始作如下改进。首先是加强了学习研究。现在民政处已经学习土改政策和有关建政的文件；社会处学习减租和救济失业人员等政策、文件。另外，确定在今后写总结、指示时，要事先经过集体讨论，负责同志具体指导，然后由一人执笔。公文处理方面，已建立了集体办公制度，上午十二时来的公文，下午二时就可到达办稿人的手里。过去一件便函要办一天到二天；现在一件批答一天半就可出门。关于整个部的分工方面，已经由一个专门的小组拟出了制度草案，在大会上公布，现在大家正在讨论，并将根据大家意见订出各部门的办事细则。这个检讨，改进的过程，对下边同志起了启发和鼓励的作用。有些领导同志自我检讨后，下边同志也自动的进行检讨。有人说光整火车头（领导）不行，还要整车厢（下边），不然光火车头跑，车厢不动也不行。有人并在会上宣布自己要订出工作计划。因为领导上的开始改进，有人觉得今后工作“有门路了”，增加了工作信心。
    最高人民法院西北分院，在政策思想方面得到了提高。分院具体检查了已经处理过的重大的典型性的案件，揭露了在执行政策中的偏差。如刑庭在审核一西安市的土匪案件时，其中主犯系一反革命特务分子，并在抢劫中枪杀一人，法院当时强调该犯曾缴过一次枪，且主要是为抢劫，不是为了杀人，而忽视其为怙恶不悛的反革命分子。因此，只判决了该犯十年徒刑。经过这次检讨，认为这是没有正确掌握镇压与宽大相结合的政策，是过于宽大的偏向。现在分院已指示西安市人民法院重新处理此一案件。同时检查出，在西北的某些监狱中，在执行惩罚与教育相结合这一方针上，也是有偏差的，即过分强调了教育的作用。甚至错误的提出“教育为主，宽大为怀”的口号。下边发生这些偏向，是和分院的领导思想不够明确有关系的。这次检讨以后，分院思想上有了进一步明确的认识。在民庭方面检查出，过去在审判案件时，往往只是就案判案，判完了事，而不管是不是解决了问题和效果如何。检讨以后，提出今后审案时要以高度的对人民负责的态度，深入的调查研究，耐心的解释政策。分院各部门根据检查出的情况分别订立了改进工作的制度。领导上也开始主动的检查下边的工作，改变了过去上边不命令自己就不动的作风。
    军政委员会办公厅的中心问题是处理公文效率不高，在这方面着重解决了四个问题：第一、是负责的态度问题，今后处理公文一定要认真分析公文的性质，以及如何来解决问题，以便使此件公文真正发生应有的效力。第二、是要分清轻重缓急，确定先后次序，按次序办理。第三、要有全局观点：有些公文是分给主管的各个部办理的，应该估计该部的情况和困难，给以尽可能的协助；公文分去以后，要及时的进行督促。第四、根据检讨结果，订出了必要的制度。
    在解决问题阶段中，有少数机关因为领导松懈，或领导上所要解决的问题，未能和广大群众的意见结合起来，上下脱节，使检查工作不能深入开展，结果收效不大。
