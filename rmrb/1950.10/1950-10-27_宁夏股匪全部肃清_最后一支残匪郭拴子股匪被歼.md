Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 25th. The last remnant bandit group of Guo Shuanzi in Ningxia Province (previously reported as Guo Guaizi in error) was completely annihilated on the 14th of this month. Note: After other bandit groups in the Ningxia area were successively annihilated, Guo Shuanzi's bandit group of over a hundred people sneaked into the Helan Mountains, relying on the natural barrier to harass the area. On September 12th, our bandit suppression troops penetrated deep into the Helan Mountains to the lair of the Guo bandits and launched a campaign of suppression. On the 5th of this month, Guo Shuanzi was captured alive in the forest of the Xifengkou mountain gully in Pingluo County, and most of his bandits were annihilated. Our bandit suppression troops continued to search and suppress the scattered bandits. The escaped bandit leader Xie Zhankui finally surrendered to our bandit suppression troops on the 14th of this month. Thus, the banditry in Ningxia was completely eliminated.

Note: The habitual bandit Guo Shuanzi had been harming the people of Ningxia for more than twenty years. After the liberation of Ningxia Province last September, he accepted the appointment of bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek as "Commander of the Ningxia Military Region of the Northwest Anti-Soviet and Communist National Salvation Army," and continued to do evil. The people of Ningxia suffered greatly and hated him to the core.

　　宁夏股匪全部肃清
    最后一支残匪郭拴子股匪被歼
    【新华社西安二十五日电】宁夏省最后一支残匪郭拴子匪股（前报误为郭拐子）已于本月十四日被全部歼灭。按：郭拴子匪股百余人，在宁夏地区其他股匪相继就歼后，即潜入贺兰山，凭据天险四出窜扰。九月十二日，我剿匪部队深入贺兰山中郭匪窠穴展开清剿，于本月五日在平罗县西峰口山沟树林内将郭匪活捉，所属匪众大部被歼。我剿匪部队继对潜藏散匪展开搜剿，前次漏网之匪首谢占奎终于本月十四日向我剿匪部队投降。宁夏股匪乃告完全肃清。
    按：惯匪郭拴子为害宁夏人民二十余年，去年九月宁夏省解放后，又接受匪首蒋介石之委任，任“西北反苏讨共救国军宁夏军区司令员”，继续作恶，宁夏人民受害极重，均恨之入骨。
