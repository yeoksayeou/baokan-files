New Book and Magazine Introductions

*New Observer*, Issue 8

The main content of the eighth issue of *New Observer* is reporting on the first National Day and the National Conference of Combat Heroes and Model Workers. In Ge Yang's "A Grand Review of the Strength of the Chinese People," Yao Yuanfang's "The Banner of National Heroes is Calling," and Tian Liu's "Builders of the People's Motherland," the two major historical conferences and the grand scene of the National Day parade in the capital are summarized and vividly reported, demonstrating the unparalleled strength of our country in consolidating national defense and economic construction.

Regarding articles reviewing the work achievements of the past year since the founding of the country, this issue contains Zeng Zhaolun's "The Progress of Chinese Education as Seen from the Joint Entrance Examination of North China Universities," Hua Shu's "The Brilliant Achievements of Agricultural Construction in New China," Ge Qizhang's "Developing Yangtze River Shipping," and Jian Ren's "A Year in the Porcelain City."

Mu Xin's "The Increasingly Awakening Yao People of Guangdong and Guangxi" and Xu Anru's "Overseas Chinese in the French-Occupied Zone of Vietnam Support New China" report on the love of the various ethnic minorities in the border areas and overseas Chinese for the people's motherland.

In addition, Cai Yongchun's "The Road Forward for Christianity in New China" elaborates on the patriotic declaration of the "Three-Self Patriotic Movement" issued by the Chinese Christian community. Xu Ying's "Autumn Harvest in the Suburbs of Beijing" and Long Ti's "New Villages on Wasteland," as well as Bing Lin's "Labor is Glorious," depict several different facets of the liberated countryside. Gu Fen's "Investigation of the Economic Situation in Taiwan" and "News Notes"'s "New Conspiracy of American Imperialism Against Taiwan" expose new acts of aggression by American imperialism from an economic and political perspective.

The picture section of this issue of *New Observer*, all twenty-two pages, introduces the situation of the National Day in the capital, showing the great unity of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups and the powerful national defense forces of our country.

*World Knowledge*, Issue 14

The international affairs weekly *World Knowledge*, Volume 22, Issue 14, was published on the 8th of this month. This issue published an editorial entitled "The Situation in Korea After the Retreat from Seoul," pointing out that the temporary reoccupation of some cities in Korea by the US imperialists is nothing but a desperate struggle, which can never reverse its basic unfavorable conditions, nor can it avoid the fate of failure. The editorial emphasizes that the situation in Korea is closely related to our security, and we cannot but care about and intervene in the development of the Korean situation. The editorial concludes: We, the Chinese people, have the power and determination to stop any conspiracy and action of US imperialism daring to expand its war of aggression against Korea! Important articles in this issue include Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling's "The Role of the Victory of the Korean People in Asia"; Ma Jianbai's "The Struggle for War and Peace at the United Nations General Assembly"; Xue Chun's "The Dispute Between Imperialist Countries on the Issue of Arming West Germany"; and Su Zhongxiang's translation of "An Ironclad Proof of the US Imperialist Attempt to Provoke War." The foreign commentary selection column specifically translated American military commentator Werner's "On America's 'Production Wins' Strategy." The slander and confession column also specifically translated the full text of war-monger MacArthur's speech to the American Overseas Veterans Association on August 27, fully exposing MacArthur's ambition to invade and occupy Taiwan; Lippmann's "On the American Strategic Situation," fully demonstrated the outwardly strong but inwardly weak situation of the imperialist group. This issue also contains a poem by Korean Qiu Shuangfang, "No Interference in Korea," translated by Zhao Zi, with five illustrations by Ding Cong.

*Bolshevik*, Issue 17

The theoretical guidance journal of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), *Bolshevik*, bi-monthly, Issue 17, has recently arrived in Beijing.
