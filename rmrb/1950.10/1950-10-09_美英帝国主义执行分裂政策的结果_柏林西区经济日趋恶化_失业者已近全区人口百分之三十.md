Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 7th. According to a TASS report from Berlin: Due to the US-British imperialists' policy of dividing Berlin politically and economically, the economic collapse in West Berlin is worsening.

　　Taking the flour mills and bakeries in West Berlin as an example: Although the output of each factory has been reduced by 30 percent, it is still difficult to maintain production. Many bakeries in the US-occupied zone of West Berlin can only supply bread twice a week. Therefore, an increasing number of West Berlin citizens are going to the Eastern District to shop.

　　This situation has caused panic and shame among the American occupation authorities and the West Berlin puppets. Taylor, the commander of the US occupation zone in Berlin, held a meeting with the puppet municipal government and police units, deciding to take "strict police measures" to search citizens' bags and confiscate all items purchased from the democratic district. For example, at the "Osram" light bulb factory in West Berlin, the factory even implemented a body search system when workers entered the factory, confiscating all cigarettes, coffee, and other food items purchased from the democratic sector. Their shameless atrocities have aroused angry protests from the workers.

　　According to a report by United States Information Service reporter Stephen White, the unemployment figures for West Berlin in August show that the city is approaching economic collapse week by week. The unemployment rate is approaching 30 percent of the West Berlin population, and the employment index in winter is bound to decline further. White also said: "This is a terrible situation, and there is no hope of improvement."

　　美英帝国主义执行分裂政策的结果
    柏林西区经济日趋恶化
    失业者已近全区人口百分之三十
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社柏林消息：由于美英帝国主义在政治上和经济上执行分裂柏林的政策，柏林西区经济崩溃情形已更趋恶化。
    以柏林西区面粉厂和面包厂为例：各厂产量虽已减少百分之三十，仍难维持生产。西柏林美占区有许多面包房每星期仅能供给两次面包。因此，西区市民到东区购物者，已日愈众多。
    此种情形，引起了美国占领当局和西区傀儡的惊慌和羞怒。柏林美占区司令泰勒曾与傀儡市府和警察等单位举行会议，决定采取“严厉警察措施”，搜查市民行囊并没收一切购自东区的物品。例如在西柏林“奥司令”电灯泡制造厂，厂方竟于工人进厂时实行搜身制，抄收了工人所有购自民主市区的纸烟、咖啡和其他食品。他们这种无耻的暴行，已引起工人愤怒的抗议。
    另据美国新闻处记者斯特风·怀特报道称：柏林西区八月份失业数字显示：该城正一周一周地接近经济崩溃。失业比率正接近西区人口百分之三十，而且冬季的就业指数必然还要下降。怀特又说：“这是一个可怕的局势，而且是没有改善的希望的。”
