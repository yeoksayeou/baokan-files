Xinhua News Agency, 21st. The South China Regional Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union issued the following statement regarding the matter of Chinese seamen in Hong Kong being forced to enlist in the war of aggression against Korea:

The American imperialists are desperately expanding their adventurous war of aggression in Korea, attempting to salvage their inevitable defeat. In addition to stepping up the arming of Japan, they are also driving their vassal states, such as Britain, France, and Australia, to act as accomplices in the war. The troops sent by these countries have now been thrown into the battlefield to jointly slaughter the heroic and peace-loving Korean people. However, in the quagmire of the Korean War, these imperialists will inevitably sink deeper and deeper, and ultimately perish.

In their desperate struggle, the imperialists are resorting to any means, using all kinds of deception and oppression to force our seamen workers to act as tools of murder. According to reports, the British Hong Kong government has begun to notify shipping companies to prepare ships for requisition at any time for military use. Initially, the scope of requisition was limited to British ships, but now even the ferries in Hong Kong that transport vehicles across the sea are being requisitioned. They are also conducting seaman registration through shipping companies. Those who are unwilling to be requisitioned with the ships are not guaranteed employment. That is to say, those who are unwilling to be tools of the imperialists' war will be forced to be dismissed. Shameless labor scabs are aiding the evildoers. They are openly convening meetings and threatening workers, and those who express unwillingness to be cannon fodder are put on a blacklist.

The South China Regional Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union expresses a serious protest against this despicable and vile act of oppressing our Chinese seamen to be tools of imperialist aggression. We must also warn the labor traitors who are aiding the tiger, do not think that you can act recklessly behind the imperialists, oppressing workers to be cannon fodder for the imperialists and selling out the interests of the Chinese people. The inevitable defeat of imperialism has long been decided. If you continue to do evil, once the iceberg you are relying on collapses, you will not escape the punishment of the people.

Finally, we call on all seamen in Hong Kong to carry forward the spirit of thirty years of revolutionary tradition, unite more closely, create various forms of struggle, and fight against persecution, against the war of aggression, and for the protection of jobs and livelihoods.

Seamen of South China, Chinese seamen will support you with the greatest strength, and victory will surely belong to us workers.

    抗议香港英政府的卑劣行为
    该政府竟强迫我国海员参加侵朝战争
    【新华社二十一日讯】为香港中国海员被迫应征参加侵略朝鲜战争事，中国海员工会华南区委员会特发表声明如次：
    美帝国主义者在朝鲜拼命扩大冒险的侵略战争，妄图挽救其必然失败之命运，除了加紧武装日本外，更驱使其仆从国家英、法、澳等做战争帮凶。这些国家派出的部队现都被投进战场去，共同一起来屠杀英勇的爱好和平的朝鲜人民。可是，在朝鲜战争的泥沼里，这些帝国主义者亦必将愈陷愈深，最后归于覆灭。
    在他们拼命挣扎的时候，帝国主义者竟不择手段，用一切欺骗、压迫等方法逼我海员工人充当杀人工具。据报载香港英政府已开始通知航商准备船只随时应征，作为军用。初时，征用范围只限英轮，现在连同香港运载车辆渡海的小轮都要了。他们更通过航商进行海员登记，凡不愿意随轮应征者不保障职业。这就是说，凡不愿意做帝国主义者的战争工具，就会被迫解雇，无耻的工棍更助纣为虐。公开召集会议，威胁工人，凡表示不愿意当炮灰的就列入黑名单。
    对这种压迫我中国海员去当帝国主义侵略工具的卑鄙恶劣行为，我中国海员工会华南区委员会表示严重的抗议：我们更要警告为虎作伥的工贼，你们不要以为躲在帝国主义者后面就可胡作乱为，欺压工人去当帝国主义者的炮灰，出卖中国人民的利益。帝国主义必然失败的命运早已决定了，如果你们还继续作恶下去，一旦你们所靠着的冰山崩颓，你们将难逃人民惩罚。
    最后，我们号召香港全体海员，发扬三十年革命传统精神，更紧密地团结，创造多种斗争方式，为反对迫害，反对侵略战争，保障职业、保障生活而奋斗。
    华南海员，中国海员必以最大力量来支持你们，胜利一定是属于我们工人的。
