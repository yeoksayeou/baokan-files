　　Reforming Work and Strengthening Economic Accounting Principles and Rationally Organizing Labor in the Rectification Campaign of the Rehe Beipiao Mining Bureau
    [This Dispatch from Rehe] During the rectification process, the Beipiao Mining Bureau took a detour. After review and research, it shifted to inspecting current practical work. The focus was primarily on resolving the serious problems of inefficient use of labor and lax labor discipline, which had led to waste of state property and excessively high costs, caused by unreasonable labor organization.

    In the past, the Beipiao Mining Bureau had the serious problem of only focusing on "completing tasks" without considering cost accounting. It had continuously increased the number of workers, and due to unreasonable labor organization, there was serious idleness and waiting for materials, as well as lax labor discipline. For example, in August, there were 1,370 workers in Nanshan, but only over 900 were actually working. Workers reported having nothing to do, and underground workers were sleeping in the tunnels. According to preliminary statistics within the bureau, there are currently over 800 surplus workers just underground. Therefore, reorganizing organizational structures and rationally organizing labor have become the primary keys to improving quality, reducing costs, and improving production. In addition, leaders at all levels in the mines lack long-term planning, and the use of labor is like "robbing Peter to pay Paul." Some workers are engaged in tunneling today, coal mining tomorrow, and repairs the day after. The workers themselves do not know what they are doing, which seriously affects the study and mastery of technology and prevents them from fully utilizing their labor efficiency. Therefore, implementing fixed staffing levels not only relates to reducing the state's production costs but also facilitates workers improving their skills.

    After studying these situations in detail, the mining bureau leadership proposed adjusting labor and implementing fixed staffing levels at the Management Committee, the Workers' Representative Conference, and the expanded meeting of Party, government, labor union, and Youth League cadres to achieve consensus. At the same time, it was pointed out that this work must be carried out resolutely and prudently, opposing a rough and careless style. It is essential to provide appropriate arrangements for surplus workers, and the method must adopt a democratic and centralized approach that combines leadership and the masses. It is necessary to resolutely follow the mass line, opposing cadres taking over and doing everything themselves, as well as laissez-faire, and preventing personal retaliation and other phenomena. The mine has now decided that the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League will mobilize all cadres, effectively unify their forces, and closely and specifically divide labor to each pithead to carry out this work, to ensure its smooth completion in a short period.

　　热河北票矿务局整风中改进工作
    加强经济核算思想合理组织劳动力
    【本报热河讯】北票矿务局整风过程中走了一段弯路，经过检讨研究后，转入进行检查当前实际工作。首先着重因解决劳动力组织不合理所造成严重的窝工和劳动纪律松懈，浪费国家财产，成本太高的现象。
    北票矿务局过去严重的存在着单纯为了“完成任务”没有成本核算观点，曾不断增加工人；劳动组织不合理，发生严重地窝工待料，劳动纪律松懈等情况。如八月份南山一千三百七十工人，出勤的只九百多人，工人反映没有事干，坑下工人在巷道里睡觉。据局内初步统计：目前多余劳动力只坑下即八百余人。因此，整顿组织机构，合理组织劳动力，已成为目前提高质量、降低成本、搞好生产的首要关键。另外，在矿坑各级领导没有长远的计划，在劳动力的使用上是“拆东墙补西墙”。有些工人今天掘进，明天采煤，后天修理。工人自己也不知道到底是做什么的，严重的影响了工人技术钻研和熟练，不能充分的发挥工人的劳动效能。因此实行定员不仅关系到国家生产成本的降低，且便于工人提高技术。
    该矿务局领导对这些情况详细研究后，先后在管委会、职工代表会，和党政工团干部扩大会上提出调整劳动力，实行定员，以取得一致意见。同时并指出须坚决而又审慎的从事这一工作，反对粗枝大叶的作风，一定要给编余工人适当的安置，在方法上一定采用领导与群众结合的民主集中的方式，要坚决走群众路线，反对干部包办代替，与放任自流，防止私人报复等现象。现该矿决定由党、政、工、团动员全体干部，很好地统一力量，密切具体分工到各坑口来执行这一工作，以便于短期间顺利完成。（北票矿委会  老夫）
