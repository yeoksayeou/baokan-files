Great National Love!
    – A Record of the Gift-Giving Ceremony of the Nationalities Delegations
    By Our Reporter Bai Sheng
    One hundred and fifty-eight representatives from forty-two fraternal nationalities, including Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Uyghur, Miao, and Yi, and two hundred and nineteen members of various national cultural troupes, from the distant borders of the motherland, from the southwest, from the northwest, from the grasslands, from the mountains... from the vast and expansive land of our motherland, traveled from afar to the people's capital, participated in the grand celebration of the National Day at Tiananmen Square on October 1st, and spent this jubilant festival of the Chinese people. On the night of the 3rd, they gathered together again to solemnly present gifts to the great leader of all nationalities, Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government, as well as Vice Chairmen Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Soong Ching Ling, Li Jishen, Zhang Lan, Gao Gang, and Premier Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government.
    At 7:10, when Chairman Mao appeared from the east entrance of the venue, a storm of applause immediately resounded throughout the hall.
    The venue was filled with national sentiments, national charm, and overflowing with the emotion of great national love.
    When Lin Boqu, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government, announced the commencement of the gift-giving ceremony, solemn military music filled the hall. Chairman Mao, with a smile on his face, stepped onto the central part of the rostrum, standing before the radiant five-star red flag. Hundreds of kind eyes immediately turned to focus on the rostrum. Amidst the solemn music, the representatives of all nationalities from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, in neat formation, walked up briskly to present their gifts. Following the repeated strains of music and continuous applause, the fraternal nationality delegations from the Northwest, Southwest, Central South, East China, Northeast, and North China regions warmly stepped forward one after another to Chairman Mao, personally holding their nationalities' most precious gifts and offering them to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao cordially shook hands with each representative who presented a gift. When many representatives of different nationalities put their nationalities' clothing and hats on Chairman Mao, a fervent emotion between nationalities surged in the hearts of everyone participating in this grand gift-giving ceremony, causing people to think of the people who had lived for many years under the oppression and contempt of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the suffering they had endured in those oppressed years. However, today they have been liberated by this great leader of all nationalities, standing before them, adorned in various ethnic costumes. Today, they stand even more proudly. Listen, aren't they singing with deep gratitude: "Great Chairman Mao, it is you who guided us through the difficulties, our hearts are all with you."
    When the Southwest Nationalities Delegation presented their gifts, Vice Chairmen Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Soong Ching Ling, Li Jishen, Zhang Lan, Gao Gang, and Premier Zhou Enlai all appeared on the radiant rostrum, and immediately another thunderous applause echoed through the hall. They all joyfully accepted the great friendship of these fraternal nationalities. Countless banners and gifts piled up on the rostrum.
    Today, this scene of great national gathering and love is unprecedented in many years, and it is another major event in the history of New China. These people of Mao Zedong have united as strong as steel. This great force will make American imperialism tremble.

　　伟大的民族热爱！
    ——记各民族代表团献礼仪式
    本报记者  柏生
    蒙、回、藏、维、苗、彝等四十二个兄弟民族的一百五十八位代表和二百一十九位各民族文工团的团员们，从祖国遥远的边疆，从西南，从西北，从草原，从山区，……从我们祖国辽阔广大的土地上，远道跋涉来到人民首都，在十月一日国庆节天安门人民广场上参加了庆祝国庆的盛典，度过了这一个中国人民的狂欢节日。三日夜，又欢聚在一起，向伟大的各民族人民的领袖中央人民政府毛泽东主席，及中央人民政府副主席刘少奇、朱德、宋庆龄、李济深、张澜、高岗和周恩来总理隆重献礼。
    七点十分，当毛主席从会场东面的门前出现的时候，立刻暴风雨般的掌声响彻了全场。
    会场上，充满了民族的情调，民族的风韵，和洋溢着伟大的民族热爱的感情。
    当中央人民政府秘书长林伯渠宣布献礼仪式开始时，会场奏起了庄严的军乐声。毛主席面带微笑，步上了主席台的中央，站在光辉的五星红色国旗前。几百双亲切的眼睛立时都朝向主席台前注视着。在庄严的乐声中，首先是内蒙古自治区各民族的代表们列着整齐的队伍，轻快地走上去献礼了，随着一次再一次奏起的乐声和不息的掌声中，西北、西南、中南、华东、东北、华北等各区域的兄弟民族代表团都相继热烈地走到毛主席面前，将自己民族最珍贵的礼物亲手捧着敬献给毛主席。毛主席亲切地和每一个向他献礼的代表握着手。当许多不同民族的代表把自己民族的衣帽服饰穿戴到毛主席的身上时，一种民族间热烈的感情激荡在每一个参加这隆重献礼仪式的人们的心头，使人们不禁想到这些曾经长年生活在国民党反动派的压迫与鄙视下的人们，和他们在那些受压迫的年月里，所遭受的苦难。然而，今天他们已经被这个站在他们面前，被拥戴穿着各种民族服饰的伟大的各民族的领袖领导解放了。今天他们更骄傲地站立起来了。你听他们不是在深深感激地歌唱着：“伟大的毛主席，是你引导我们度过艰难，我们的心都向着你。”
    当西南各民族代表团献礼时，副主席刘少奇、朱德、宋庆龄、李济深、张澜、高岗和周恩来总理都一一在光辉的主席台上出现了，立时又是一阵雷动的掌声响过会场，他们一一欢欣地接受着这伟大的兄弟民族的情谊。无数面的锦旗和礼物在主席台上堆起来了。
    今天，这伟大的民族欢聚热爱的场面，是多少年来从没有过的，这又是新中国历史上的一件大事。这些毛泽东的人民，已经团结得象钢铁一般的坚强，这伟大的力量，将使美帝国主义看着发抖。
