Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd: "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese version, Issue 59, was published on the 21st. The editorial in this issue, titled "A New Stage of the Peace Movement," first points out that the strength of the international peace front is unprecedented. More than fifty countries have national peace committees and peace movement organizations. The peace movement unites workers, farmers, intellectuals, women, youth, and people with different political beliefs, philosophies of life, and religious beliefs. Four hundred million people (as of late September statistics) have signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal. The editorial points out that due to the U.S. imperialists' frenzied arms race and open aggression, the international situation has become acute, and the international peace movement faces new, great, and serious tasks: expanding the movement's plans, opposing war, opposing any kind of aggression, and opposing propaganda that incites new wars. The movement against the new war crisis and for consolidating peace must be coordinated with the overall struggle against the arms race, with the demand to prohibit the use of atomic weapons as weapons of aggression and mass destruction of humanity, and supplemented by universal disarmament, strict supervision of the implementation of this plan, the elimination of all existing weapons of mass destruction, the prohibition of war-mongering propaganda, and at the same time, the demand to arrest and bring to justice the enemies of peaceful humanity, such as Churchill, Dulles, MacArthur, Johnson, Moore-Brabazon, Bradley, Reynaud, Moke, and the like. The editorial calls on the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries to help peace fighters complete the above tasks while preparing for the Second World Peace Congress.

This issue prominently features an article by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, titled "Important Administrative and Economic Reforms in the Romanian People's Republic." In addition, it also publishes articles such as Kovaliov's "The Remilitarization of West Germany" and Doudet's "The National Liberation Movement in Iran Will Foil the Conspiracies of U.S. and British Imperialists."

    【新华社二十二日讯】“争取持久和平，争取人民民主!”中文版第五十九期已于二十一日出版。该刊本期在以“新阶段的和平运动”为题的社论中首先指出：国际和平战线的力量空前强大。五十多个国家都有了全国性的和平委员会的和平运动组织。和平运动团结了工人、农民、知识分子、妇女、青年以及政治信仰、人生观和宗教信仰各不相同的人们。已有四万万的人民（截止九月下旬的统计）在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签名。社论指出：由于美帝国主义的疯狂备战与公然侵略，已使国际局势尖锐化，使国际和平运动面对着新的、伟大的、严重的任务：扩大运动的计划，以及反对战争，反对任何一种侵略，反对鼓动新战争的宣传。反对新战争危机和巩固和平的运动必须配合着反对军备竞赛的全面斗争，配合着禁止把原子武器当作侵略和大规模毁灭人类的武器的要求，并辅之以普遍削减军备，严格地监督这种计划的实施，消灭现存的大规模毁灭人类的各种武器，禁止战争贩子的宣传，同时将和平人类的敌人，例如邱吉尔、杜勒斯、麦克阿瑟、詹逊、莫尔——勃拉巴森、布莱德雷、雷诺、莫克之类逮捕归案的要求。社论前后号召各国的共产党和工人党应该在各国准备第二届世界拥护和平大会的时候，帮助和平战士完成上述任务。
