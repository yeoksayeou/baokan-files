　　The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee
    Convenes Commercial Work Rectification Meeting
    Clearly Proposes Future Work Tasks: Expand and Accelerate Commodity Circulation to Serve Industrial and Agricultural Production and the Needs of the People.
    [Our Newspaper] According to the Northeast Daily: The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a rectification meeting for party commercial workers on September 2nd, lasting seven days. The main purpose of the meeting was, in accordance with the spirit of rectification, to examine and summarize the experiences of state-owned commercial work. In response to the rapid recovery and development of the Northeast's national economy, the increasing purchasing power of the people, the increasing integration with the markets within the customs, and the expansion of the scope of commodity circulation both within and outside urban and rural areas, which have placed many new situations and tasks on commercial work, the meeting studied how to further invigorate the exchange of materials within and outside the Northeast's urban and rural areas, expand and accelerate commodity circulation, and serve the needs of rapidly developing industrial and agricultural production and the people's lives. This would better complete the increasingly heavy tasks of commercial work. Around this central topic, and in light of the common issues among commercial work cadres in the Northeast, such as a lack of specific understanding of the overall economic situation and market supply and demand, a simplistic "task" viewpoint, insufficient comprehensive policy thinking, and the retention of supply system thinking in business management, the meeting repeatedly studied three basic policies: the correct integration of state-owned commerce with various economic forces, the correct understanding and implementation of price policies, and the implementation of economic accounting systems in business management. At the same time, the meeting also discussed strengthening the leadership of commercial departments and transforming work styles.

    At the meeting, Comrade Zhang Mingyuan, on behalf of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, delivered a speech entitled "Strive to Expand and Accelerate Commodity Circulation," summarizing the state-owned commercial work in the Northeast over the past year, proposing the future tasks of state-owned commercial work, and providing a detailed explanation of the policies that must be implemented to accomplish the current tasks.

    Comrade Zhang Mingyuan first analyzed the main characteristics of the situation of state-owned commerce in the Northeast and the achievements of state-owned commerce in the Northeast over the past year in supporting industrial and agricultural production, supporting cooperatives, uniting private enterprises, and supplying the needs of urban and rural people. Then, he emphasized that the most basic and important shortcomings and problems in the current state-owned commercial work are the insufficient smoothness and vitality of material exchanges between urban and rural areas and within and outside the region. State-owned commercial work still lags behind the needs of economic development, and its role as a link serving industrial and agricultural production is not fully发挥. The reasons for this shortcoming, in addition to objective difficulties and lack of experience, are mainly that the commercial departments lack sufficient mastery and research of basic situations and major policies, lack a specific understanding of domestic and foreign markets and supply and sales conditions, lack accurate planning, lack comprehensive policy thinking, and retain "large supply system" thinking in business management. This has hindered state-owned commerce from fully发挥 its role as a link combining various economic forces. However, from the perspective of leadership responsibility, the Northeast Bureau lacked careful study of the plans proposed by the Ministry of Trade and the Planning Commission; it did not promptly revise certain unrealistic and excessively high requirements in the plan (such as the cash recovery plan); and it had production plans but did not formulate more specific distribution plans in conjunction with various parties. Party committees and governments at all levels lack sufficient attention and leadership to commercial work, and the reflection of specific situations is not accurate, which has also affected the improvement of commercial work.

    Regarding the future tasks of state-owned commercial work, Comrade Zhang Mingyuan clearly pointed out that it should be to promote and invigorate the circulation of commodities between urban and rural areas and within and outside the region, and to further serve the needs of the rapidly developing industrial and agricultural production and the people's lives. Specifically, it is to smoothly sell agricultural products, industrial raw materials, and agricultural by-products from Northeast agricultural production at appropriate prices, and to timely supply the people with reasonably priced production and living materials; at the same time, to timely and reasonably sell national industrial products, and to purchase the necessary industrial raw materials and equipment for national industry.

    How can this task be successfully accomplished? Comrade Zhang Mingyuan pointed out that three important policies must be implemented:

    First, state-owned commerce must correctly combine with various economic forces to发挥 its linking role. In the internal relations of the state-owned economy, state-owned commerce must better combine with state-owned industry and local industry. To this end, four issues should be resolved: (1) Strengthen the idea of state-owned commerce serving national industrial production. (2) Formulate plans for the distribution of industrial products and the procurement of industrial raw materials and equipment. (3) Strengthen the organization and planning of the procurement, allocation, and sales of state-owned products. (4) Make overall plans for local industries in accordance with the national overall plan and provide planned support. Secondly, state-owned commerce should better combine with cooperatives: it must continue to support the development of cooperatives, consolidate and develop business relations with cooperatives, overcome the incorrect understanding of cooperatives by some state-owned commercial cadres, and clearly establish the concept that cooperatives are the most reliable assistant and ally of the state-owned economy. At the same time, we should overcome the one-sided view of some cooperative cadres that conflicts with national interests.

    The combination of state-owned commerce and private industry and commerce should implement Article 26 and Article 37 of the Common Program. Under the principle of overall planning and consideration for all parties, organize the activities of private commerce that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and at the same time conduct serious struggles against its speculative and disruptive illegal activities. The combination with private commerce in the future should be: (1) Except for businesses that are under state monopoly purchase and sales and those prohibited from private operation, private merchants should be allowed to operate, and regulations on industrial and commercial management should be formulated in accordance with the spirit of the Common Program, and the policy of free trade in the interior should be implemented under the leadership of the state-owned economy. (2) Implement a price policy that takes into account production, transportation, and consumption. (3) Strengthen industrial and commercial management, establish and improve the organizations of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and trade associations, and strengthen their leadership.

    Second, correctly mastering and implementing price policies is one of the central keys for commercial organs to invigorate commodity circulation. (1) In mastering price policies, implement the principle of taking into account production, transportation, and consumption, overcome one-sidedness, and oppose the tendencies of price policies deviating from the market and following the market blindly. (2) Specific research and proposals should be made on the price differences between industrial and agricultural products, the price differences between wholesale and retail, preferential prices for cooperatives, regional price differences, the relationship between allocation prices and market prices, and the relationship between prices set by the Ministry of Trade and free market prices. (3) The price policy for the purchase of local products should combine the current and long-term interests of farmers and consider the supply and demand situation in domestic and foreign markets, and determine the purchase price based on actual conditions. (4) Strengthen the leadership of price work, enrich price work institutions, strengthen price investigation and research, accurately reflect the real situation of economic development, and formulate reasonable prices.

    Third, in the operation and management of state-owned commerce, the economic accounting system must be implemented. The main tasks in this regard are to accelerate the turnover rate of funds, reduce additional expenses in commodity circulation, reduce operating costs, and ensure reasonable national profits and capital accumulation. In terms of ideology, we must change the style of the large supply system, and in terms of organization, we must overcome bureaucratization in order to implement the enterprise management policy.

    In the conclusion of the report, Comrade Zhang Mingyuan emphasized that the entire party must attach importance to commercial work, and pointed out that party committees at all levels should strengthen the leadership of commercial departments in the implementation of guidelines and policies, in the formulation of plans, and in the analysis and mastery of the situation. Party committees at all levels should also regularly check and assist in solving difficult problems in the work. At the same time, he pointed out that the work of trade unions in the state-owned commercial system should be strengthened. As for the commercial departments themselves, they should strengthen the investigation and research of basic situations, strengthen the overall policy perspective and mass perspective, promote a scientific and precise style, and pay attention to more actively contacting various relevant departments.

　　中共中央东北局
    召开商业工作整风会议
    明确提出今后工作任务：扩大与加速商品流通，为工农业生产及人民生活需要服务。
    【本报讯】据东北日报讯：中共中央东北局于九月二日召开党的商业工作者的整风会议，历时七天。会议主要目的是根据整风精神，检查与总结国营商业工作的经验，并针对东北国民经济迅速的恢复与发展，人民购买力日渐提高，与关内市场日益结合，城乡内外商品流通范围扩大，对商业工作提出了许多新情况新任务的特点，研究如何进一步活跃东北城乡内外的物资交流，扩大与加速商品流通，为迅速发展的工农业生产与人民生活需要服务，以便更好地完成商业工作日益繁重的任务。会议围绕这个中心议题，并针对目前东北商业工作干部中较普遍存在的对整个经济状况与市场供求情况缺乏具体了解，单纯“任务”观点，全面政策思想不够，以及在经营管理中保留下来的供给制思想等情况，反复研究了三个基本政策：国营商业与各种经济力量正确地结合，正确地掌握与执行价格政策，在经营管理上贯彻经济核算制。同时，对加强商业部门的领导，改造作风问题也作了讨论。
    会议上，张明远同志代表中共中央东北局以“为扩大与加速商品流通而斗争”为题，总结了一年来东北的国营商业工作，提出了今后国营商业工作的任务，并就完成当前任务必须贯彻的政策问题作了详尽的阐述。
    张明远同志首先分析了东北国营商业所处情况的主要特点，及东北国营商业一年来在扶助工农业生产，扶植合作社，团结私营企业，供给城乡人民需要方面的成绩。接着，他着重指出：目前国营商业工作上最基本最主要的缺点和问题，是城乡、内外物资交流不够畅通活跃，国营商业工作还落后于经济发展的需要，其为工农业生产服务的纽带作用发挥得不足。产生这个缺点的原因，除了客观困难和经验不足外，从商业部门说，主要是对基本情况与主要政策掌握研究不够，对内外市场与供销情况缺乏具体的了解，计划欠准确，全面的政策思想不足，以及在经营管理上有“大供给制”思想等，障碍了国营商业充分发挥作为结合各种经济力量的纽带的作用。但从领导责任说，东北局对贸易部与计划委员会提出的计划缺乏仔细的研究；对计划中若干脱离实际的过高要求（如回笼计划）未及时修正；有了生产计划，而没有制定与各方面结合的较具体的分配计划。各级党委、政府对商业工作缺乏足够的重视和领导，具体情况的反映不确实，也影响了商业工作的改进。
    关于今后国营商业工作的任务，张明远同志明确指出：应是促进与活跃城乡、内外的商品流通，进一步为迅速发展着的工农业生产及人民生活需要服务。具体地说，就是以适当的价格顺利地推销东北农业生产的商品粮食、工业原料、农业副产品，及时供给人民需要的价格合理的生产与生活资料；同时及时地合理地推销国家工业产品，并为国家工业收购必需的工业原料和器材。
    如何才能胜利地达成这个任务？张明远同志指出：必须贯彻三个重要的政策：
    第一、国营商业必须与各种经济力量正确地结合，以发挥其纽带作用。在国营经济内部关系上国营商业要与国营工业与地方工业更好地结合。为此，应该解决四个问题：（一）加强国营商业为国家工业生产服务的思想。（二）制定工业产品分配与工业原料器材采购计划。（三）加强对国营产品采购、调拨、推销之组织性与计划性。（四）对地方工业按国家总计划统盘筹划，进行有计划地扶助。其次国营商业要与合作社更好地结合：必须继续扶助合作社的发展，巩固与发展对合作社的业务关系，克服某些国营商业干部对合作社的不正确认识，明确树立合作社是国营经济最可靠的助手与同盟者的观念。同时，应克服某些合作社干部存在的与国家利益的片面观点。
    国营商业对私营工商业的结合，应贯彻共同纲领第二十六条及第三十七条，在统筹兼顾原则下，组织私营商业有利于国计民生的活动，同时对其投机捣把等非法行为应进行严肃的斗争。今后对私人商业的结合应是：（一）除国家统购统销与禁止私商经营的业务外，均应允许私商经营，并按共同纲领精神制定工商管理条例，并在国营经济领导下，贯彻内地贸易自由的政策。（二）贯彻生产、运输、消费三方面兼顾的价格政策。（三）加强工商管理，建立并健全工商联合会同业公会的组织，并加强对它的领导。
    第二，正确地掌握执行价格政策是商业机关活跃商品流通的中心关键之一。（一）在价格政策掌握上，贯彻对生产、贩运、消费三方面兼顾的方针，克服片面性，反对价格政策脱离市场及随行做市的偏向。（二）应对工农产品差价，批发与零售差价，合作社的优待价格，地区差价，以及调拨价格与市场价格的关系，贸易部规定价格与自由市场价格的关系，进行具体研究，提出方案。（三）收购土产的价格政策应使农民目前及长远利益结合，并考虑内外市场的供求状况，依据实际情况确定收购价格。（四）加强对物价工作的领导，充实物价工作机构，加强物价的调查研究，正确地反映经济发展的真实情况，制定合理的物价。
    第三，在国营商业的经营管理上要贯彻经济核算制。在这方面的主要任务是加速资金的周转率，降低商品流通中的附加开支，减低经营成本，保证国家的合理利润与资金积累。而在思想上必须转变大供给制思想作风，在组织上克服机关化，才能贯彻企业化经营方针。
    在报告的结语中，张明远同志强调全党必须重视商业工作，指出各级党委应在方针政策的执行上，在制定计划上，在情况的分析与掌握上，加强对商业部门的领导，各级党委并应经常检查与协助解决工作中的困难问题。同时，他指出：国营商业系统中工会工作应该加强。至于商业部门本身则应加强对基本情况的调查研究，加强全面的政策观点与群众观点，提倡科学的精密的作风，注意更主动地与各有关部门联系。
