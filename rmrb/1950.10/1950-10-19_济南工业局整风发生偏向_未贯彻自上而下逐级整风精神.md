　　Jinan Industrial Bureau's Rectification Campaign Takes a Wrong Turn
    The Spirit of Rectification from Top to Bottom, Level by Level, Was Not Implemented
    [Jinan News] *Dazhong Daily* news: The Jinan Industrial Bureau relaxed its leadership in the rectification campaign, failed to implement the spirit of in-depth rectification level by level from top to bottom, and took a detour. After more than a month of rectification, the key problems of the overall work have not yet been found.

　　The bureau began studying documents in August. Leading cadres failed to earnestly combine work and rectification. While the bureau and factory-level administrative organizations were making a concentrated effort to finalize the 1950 order plan, they broadly arranged for rectification study, causing most cadres to feel that the rectification study was difficult to start. Some factory directors were busy with work and did not participate in the study. Some units did not link their study with reality. The bureau's leaders did not seriously convene a rectification mobilization meeting. Although a general mobilization report was made in early September, it was quite empty due to insufficient prior preparation, and the general comrades reflected that it did not solve the problem. Seeing the leadership's perfunctory attitude, they had no confidence in the rectification.

　　After entering the work inspection stage, the leadership did not first inspect the overall leadership of the bureau, but instead inspected the work of each section. Although the higher authorities repeatedly instructed that this rectification must be carried out from top to bottom, level by level, and some people at the time proposed that work should be inspected from top to bottom, it was not accepted and adopted by the bureau's leaders. As a result, after more than a month of rectification, the key problems of the overall work have not yet been found.

　　After the Jinan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out the deviations in the bureau's rectification campaign, Wang Xinmin, the director of the bureau, and Dong Zhongchi, the deputy secretary of the Communist Party Committee, both made leadership self-criticisms and reports. The sections and factories inspected the leadership of the bureau separately, and the bureau also widely collected opinions from below and carried out criticism and self-criticism, and then made a summary report of the bureau. After the bureau's rectification summary is prepared, the work of the sections and factories will be inspected again.

　　济南工业局整风发生偏向
    未贯彻自上而下逐级整风精神
    【济南讯】大众日报消息：济南工业局整风中放松领导，未贯彻自上而下逐级深入的精神，走了一段弯路。至今整了一个多月，尚未找出全局工作的关键问题。
    该局自八月开始学习文件。领导干部未认真把工作和整风结合起来，正当局、厂两级行政组织突击一九五○年的订货计划时，却泛泛地布置了整风学习，致多数干部认为整风学习无法下手。有的厂长忙于工作，不参加学习。有的单位学习时不联系实际。局领导同志没有认真召开整风动员会议，九月初虽作了一般性的动员报告，但因事前准备不足，内容相当空洞，使一般同志都反映不解决问题。他们看了领导上的草率态度，对整风都无信心。
    进入检查工作阶段后，领导上没有首先检查全局的领导，却先检查了各科的工作。上级虽一再指示此次整风必须自上而下逐级深入，当时也有人提出应自上而下检查工作，但却没有被该局领导者接受和采纳。结果是整风进行了一个多月，尚未找出全局工作的关键问题。
    中共济南市委指出该局整风中的偏向后，该局王新民局长、中共党委会董仲池副书记都作了领导的检讨和报告。科、厂分别检查局的领导，该局也广泛搜集下边意见，开展批评自我批评，然后再作局的总结报告。准备局整风总结后，再检查科、厂的工作。
