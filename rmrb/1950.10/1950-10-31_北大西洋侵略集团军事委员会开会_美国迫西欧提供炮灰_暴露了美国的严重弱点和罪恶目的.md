Xinhua News Agency, October 29th: The so-called Military Committee of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) aggression group (composed of the chiefs of staff of each country) held its fourth meeting in Washington on the 24th and 26th, presided over by General Bradley, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff.

At this meeting, the United States vigorously pressured its puppet states to immediately implement the plan to establish a European collective aggression army under the unified command of the Americans, a plan decided by the North Atlantic Treaty Council in New York in September. According to the United States Information Service, Bradley openly clamored at the meeting that it was necessary to "build these forces now, at this good time, in this moment of peace."

The communique issued after the meeting revealed that the meeting mainly discussed the number and type of troops that each country should contribute, the establishment of a supreme command for the European regional collective aggression army, the appointment of a "supreme commander with full powers" and a chief of staff "responsible for organization and training," the "reorganization of the NATO military structure," and the approval of the Military Committee's permanent group (composed of the chiefs of staff of the United States, Britain, and France) to establish a standardization agency for the armies of each country. According to Agence France-Presse, the meeting planned to "establish seventy infantry divisions by 1953." According to United Press, the meeting decided that the supreme commander would be the American Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the Western Front during World War II. However, all these specific plans will be submitted to the NATO Defense Committee (composed of the defense ministers of twelve countries) which began in Washington on the 28th for approval before implementation.

In order to establish this Western European collective aggression army, the United States exerted great pressure on its puppet states at the meeting. According to a United Press report on the 24th, "Some small countries were asked to provide more troops than the Military Committee's permanent group had originally proposed to them." The meeting had to announce a recess on the 25th so that representatives of the puppet states could consult with their respective governments. One of the reasons why the United States wants to force the puppet states to send more troops is because it has no troops to send itself. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 24th, since the U.S. Army has been forced to commit almost all of its existing strength to the Korean War, "the United States can provide at most five to ten divisions out of the seventy or eighty divisions of the unified army in Western Europe," and "Army generals believe that one thing is certain, that it is impossible to send ten divisions at present. It is impossible to extract them from all the armies in the country, Korea, or Europe." Therefore, what the U.S. Army officers are currently "urgently planning" is only to "find a way to provide the first division of these seventy or eighty divisions." U.S. imperialism wants to carry out aggression all over the world, but it does not have enough military power, and it wants the puppet states to be its cannon fodder. This is the serious weakness and sinister attempt of the United States once again exposed at this war preparation meeting.

### 北大西洋侵略集团军事委员会开会  美国迫西欧提供炮灰  暴露了美国的严重弱点和罪恶目的

　　北大西洋侵略集团军事委员会开会
    美国迫西欧提供炮灰
    暴露了美国的严重弱点和罪恶目的
    【新华社二十九日讯】北大西洋公约侵略集团的所谓军事委员会（由各国参谋长组成）第四次会议，已于二十四、六两日在美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷主持之下在华盛顿举行。
    美国在这次会议上，曾以大力逼迫其仆从国家立即执行建立由美国人统一指挥的欧洲集体侵略军的计划，而这一计划是北大西洋公约理事会于九月间在纽约决定的。据美国新闻处称：布莱德雷在会上曾公然叫嚣，要“在现在这个良好的时机，在这和平的时刻建立这些部队”。
    会后发表的公报透露：会议主要曾讨论了各国应出部队数量和兵种的问题，建立欧洲地区集体侵略军的最高统帅部，任命“具有充分权力的最高统帅”和“负责组织与训练事宜”的参谋长的问题，“改组北大西洋公约军事机构”的问题，以及批准军事委员会常设小组（由美、英、法三国参谋长组成）建立使各国军队标准化机构的问题。据法新社透露：会议计划“在一九五三年以前建立七十个步兵师”。另据合众社称：会议已决定最高统帅人选由二次大战时西线总司令美国人艾森豪威尔担任。但所有这些具体计划，均将提交二十八日起在华盛顿举行的北大西洋公约防务委员会（由十二国国防部长组成）批准后施行。
    美国为求建立这支西欧集体侵略军，曾在会上对其仆从国家大施压力。据合众社二十四日消息称：“若干小国被要求提供的军队比军事委员会常设小组原定计划前已向他们提出的要求还要多”。会议曾不得不因此于二十五日宣布休会一天，以便各仆从国代表向其本国政府请示。美国所以要逼迫各仆从国多出兵，原因之一是因为自己无兵可出。据美联社华盛顿二十四日电称：由于美国陆军已被迫以现有实力的几乎全部投入朝鲜战争，因此“在西欧统一军七十或八十个师中，美国最多只能提供五至十个师”，“陆军将领们认为一件事是确定的，即日前无法派出十个师去。无论由驻在国内、朝鲜或欧洲等任何一地的所有陆军中都无法抽出”。因此美国陆军军官目前所“紧急筹划”的，只能是“设法提供这七八十个师中的第一个师”。美帝国主义要在全世界进行侵略，但是自己又军力不足，而要各仆从国来替自己当炮灰，这就是美国在这次备战会议上又一次暴露出来的严重弱点和阴险企图。
