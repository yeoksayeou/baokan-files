Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 27th, TASS Dispatch: The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic held an interim meeting on October 24th to discuss the results of the Eight Foreign Ministers' Meeting. The meeting issued the following communiqué: "The Government of the German Democratic Republic listened with the utmost satisfaction to the report by its Foreign Minister on the Prague Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Hungary, and the German Democratic Republic. This conference was convened as a result of the decision by the Foreign Ministers of the United States, Great Britain, and France in New York regarding the re-militarization of West Germany. The Government of the German Democratic Republic thanks the governments of the Soviet Union and the European People's Democracies for enabling the Government of the German Democratic Republic to attend the Prague Conference with full rights, and for reiterating their support for the just demands of the German people to restore the unity of their country and to conclude a peace treaty as soon as possible.

　　The decisions of the New York Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the United States, Great Britain, and France stubbornly continue their previous policy, attempting to circumvent the obligations stipulated in the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements, and attempting to include West Germany and the West Berlin districts in the aggressive North Atlantic bloc, with no intention of establishing a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany. This policy hinders the German people from restoring their economic and national unity, obstructs the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and aims to re-militarize West Germany, ultimately turning it into a tool and strategic base for military aggression by Anglo-American imperialists. This policy is a grave threat to peace and the security of the peoples of Europe, and it endangers the survival of the German people.

　　The German people's concern for the maintenance and safeguarding of peace has led to a growing resistance to the Anglo-American imperialist aggression plans, uniting all German patriots to stand up more resolutely against these plans and to prevent the revival of German imperialism. The residents of West Germany and West Berlin must most resolutely support the policy of avoiding the threat of "a new aggression, a new war gamble in Europe."

　　All peace-loving forces must unite their efforts to jointly implement the recommendations of the Prague Eight Foreign Ministers' Meeting, which are conducive to the cause of peace because they are an appropriate foundation for uniting all citizens of our German homeland.

　　The Government of the German Democratic Republic fully agrees with the proposals made by the Prague Foreign Ministers' Meeting for a peaceful solution to the German question and adheres to the following recommendations: (1) The governments of the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union issue a statement declaring that they will not allow Germany to be re-militarized, nor will they allow Germany to be drawn into any kind of aggressive plan; they will implement the Potsdam Agreement on guaranteeing the conditions for the establishment of a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany. (2) Eliminate all restrictions on Germany's peaceful economic development and prevent the restoration of Germany's war potential. (3) Immediately conclude a peace treaty with Germany in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement and stipulate that all occupying forces shall withdraw from Germany within one year after the conclusion of the peace treaty. (4) A pan-German constitutional assembly composed of representatives from East Germany and West Germany on an equal basis will prepare for the establishment of a temporary pan-German sovereign government that is democratic and peace-loving, and submit corresponding proposals to the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, and France for joint approval; and consult with the assembly on the issue of drafting a peace treaty before the establishment of a pan-German government.

　　In accordance with the obligation undertaken in Prague "to strengthen peace and international security, to promote the solution of these urgent tasks as much as possible," the Government of the German Democratic Republic hereby declares that it is prepared to participate in the establishment of a national constitutional assembly. This preparation arises from the firm conviction that the union of representatives from East and West Germany in the proposed institution composed on an equal basis is a decisive stage in overcoming the division of Germany and establishing a pan-German government, as well as a decisive stage in concluding a peace treaty with Germany.

　　For the sake of peace and the future of our country, the Government of the German Democratic Republic calls on people of all strata throughout Germany to exert their utmost efforts to support the efforts to ensure peace, conclude a peace treaty as soon as possible, build a peaceful economy, and establish a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.

　　The Government of the German Democratic Republic welcomes the fact that, in accordance with the declaration of the Prague Foreign Ministers' Meeting, the issue of establishing a pan-German consultative assembly can be put to a direct vote by the German people when the situation requires.

　　The entire German people have had painful experiences, and now they are fighting for the peace and unity of their country. They will understand that the realization of the Prague proposals will promote the realization of this hope.

　　The Government of the German Democratic Republic believes that the patriotic and peace-loving forces of our people, who recognize the current needs, will redouble their efforts and unite their forces in order to obtain peace for our country and thereby allow it to survive as a nation."

　　德意志民主共和国政府发表公报
    坚决拥护八国外长会议声明
    号召全德人民为实现和平统一而努力
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社柏林二十七日讯：德意志民主共和国部长会议于十月二十四日举行临时会议，讨论八国外长会议的结果。会议发表公报如下：“德意志民主共和国政府以极度的满意，听取了其外交部长关于苏联、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利及德意志民主共和国八国外交部长布拉格会议的报告。这次会议是因美、英、法三国外交部长的纽约会议关于西德重行军事化的决定而召开的。德意志民主共和国政府感谢苏联和欧洲各人民民主国家的政府，因为它们使德意志民主共和国政府能有完全的权利出席布拉格会议，并对德国人民渴望恢复他们祖国的统一和尽快缔订和约的正义要求，再度给予支持。
    美、英、法三国外长纽约会议的决定，顽固地继续他们从前的政策，企图规避雅尔达和波茨坦协定所规定的义务，并企图把德国西部和柏林西区包括入侵略性的北大西洋集团，没有想要建立统一、民主和爱好和平的德国。这种政策妨害德国人民恢复其经济的与国家的统一，妨碍对德和约的缔结，其目的在于使西德重新军事化，最后把它变成英美帝国主义者进行军事侵略的工具与战略基地。这种政策是和平与欧洲各国人民安全的严重威胁，而且危及德国人民的生存。
    德国人民关怀和平的维持与确保，这使得德国人民对英美帝国主义侵略计划的抗拒日益增长，并把所有的德国爱国分子团结在一起，更加坚决地起来反对这些计划与制止德国帝国主义的复活。德国西部与柏林西区的居民，必须最坚决地支持避免“欧洲新侵略、新战争赌博”的威胁的政策。
    一切爱好和平的力量都必须把他们的努力联合起来，共同实现布拉格八国外长会议的各项建议，这些建议是有利于和平事业的，因为它们是团结我们德意志祖国全体公民的适当基础。
    德意志民主共和国政府完全赞同布拉格外长会议所提要求和平解决德国问题的建议，并遵从下列各项建议：（一）美、英、法、苏四国政府发表声明：宣布它们将不容许德国重新军事化，亦不容德国被拉入任何种类的侵略计划之中；它们将实施关于保证成立统一、爱好和平以及民主的德国的条件的波茨坦协定。（二）取消对德国和平经济发展的一切限制，并防止德国战争潜力的恢复。（三）立即按照波茨坦协定缔结对德和约，并规定在缔结和约后一年内，各国占领军一律自德国撤退。（四）在平等的基础上由德国东部和德国西部代表组成全德立宪议会，该议会将筹备成立民主、爱好和平的临时全德主权政府，并将相应的建议提交苏、美、英、法四国政府共同批准；并在全德政府尚未成立以前，与该议会协商拟定和约的问题。
    按照在布拉格所承担的“为了加强和平与国际安全，将尽可能促进这些迫切任务的解决”的义务，德意志民主共和国政府兹声明：它准备参与成立全国立宪议会。这种准备之产生，是由于深信德国东部和西部的代表，在所建议的在平等基础上组成的机构中联合在一起，乃是克服德国的分裂与成立全德政府的一个决定性的阶段，也是缔结对德和约的一个决定性的阶段。
    为了和平与我国的前途，德意志民主共和国政府号召全德国各阶层人民尽最大的力量，支持为保证和平、尽速缔结和约、建设和平经济与成立统一、民主、爱好和平的德国而作的努力。
    德意志民主共和国政府欢迎按照布拉格外长会议的声明，在情况需要时，可以将成立全德协商议会的问题由德国人民直接投票复决。
    全体德国人民有过痛苦的经验，现在他们正在为争取他们祖国的和平与统一而奋斗，他们会了解：布拉格建议的实现将促进这一希望的实现。
    德意志民主共和国政府相信，认识到目前需要的我国人民爱国的和爱好和平的力量，将加倍努力并团结他们的力量，以便为我们的国家取得和平，并从而使它作为一个国家而生存。”
