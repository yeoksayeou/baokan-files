　　This is a Communist!
    ——The Heroic Deeds of Xu Hanlin Sacrificing His Life to Blow Up a Bunker
    Comrade Xu Hanlin, a brave people’s fighter, was the deputy squad leader of the seventh squad of the sixth company of the first battalion of the Second Detachment of Lushun, and a member of the Chinese Communist Party, and a people’s hero in the battle to liberate Tianjin. In the battle to encircle and annihilate the enemy entrenched in Pangu Village, northwest of Ling Mountain, on September 23, he demonstrated amazing courage and the noble qualities of a class fighter, sacrificing his precious life to blow up a bunker, annihilating a total of more than 300 bandits from an entire regiment, and establishing immortal merit for the bandit suppression troops.
    Pangu Village is located in a strategically important position on the hillside of Nanshan Mountain. The entire "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army" 19th Division, 74th Regiment, with more than 300 bandits, was entrenched in the village and built strong fortifications on the top of Nanshan Mountain. In addition to outer trenches and tunnels, three tall bunkers were built, with walls connected to form a crescent-shaped position. In front were two rows of thorny bushes, taller than a person and two meters thick, one semi-circular surrounding the bunker, and the other more than ten meters away from the bunker. The mountain was more than 200 meters high, and the steep slopes were covered with grass and thorns, making it almost impossible to climb. Relying on this strategic location and solid fortifications, the bandits frantically ravaged the surrounding masses, raping, looting, and committing all kinds of evil; within a month, they robbed and killed more than 30 head of cattle belonging to the masses. The people could not live.
    At dawn on September 22, the first battalion of the Second Detachment of Lushun surrounded the bandit regiment. However, due to the intense enemy fire from the top of Nanshan Mountain, the troops could not approach. At this time, the warriors of the Sixth Company bravely accepted the glorious task of capturing the commanding height of Nanshan Mountain. Under the leadership of Company Commander Wang Kailai and Instructor Yang Jingyao, they launched a fierce attack with rapid movements, repeatedly charging five times, but still failed. At this time, the battalion Party committee issued an urgent call, demanding that the Sixth Company take the mountain top at all costs.
    All the comrades of the Sixth Company resolutely responded to this call and swore before the battalion leaders: "We will not return until the task is completed." A shock squad of ten warriors, with Communist Party members as the backbone, was organized, with three men carrying submachine guns, three men carrying explosives, and four men carrying rifles and grenades, led by squad leader Wang Sen, and continued to launch a fierce attack under the intense fire cover of the battalion. However, enemy bullets came from all directions, Comrade Wang Sen was killed, and then two more comrades fell, and two soldiers carrying explosives were also injured, but the soldiers still bravely climbed forward, stepping on the blood of the martyrs. The closer they got, about thirty meters from the enemy bunker, the more difficult it became to advance. The squad leader discussed with Comrade Xu Hanlin to first blow up the enemy bunker and then seize the position. The soldiers vied to take on the bombing task.
    Comrade Xu Hanlin first grabbed more than 30 kilograms of explosives and four grenades. The squad leader kindly told him: "Okay, go! We will definitely support you and gloriously complete the Party's task!" Comrade Xu Hanlin replied loudly: "Okay! I will definitely not let the Party down!" Under the close cover of the soldiers, Comrade Xu Hanlin, with ingenious and agile movements, rolled and crawled up, drilling through two rows of thorn bushes. He lay under the bunker, carefully checking his explosives, and found that the detonating cord of the explosives was missing at some point. This really worried Comrade Xu. In desperation, he decided to stuff the grenades into the explosives, using the explosion of the grenades to trigger the explosion of the explosives. However, the time between pulling the pin of the grenade and the explosion was very short, only three seconds (if the explosives had a detonating fuse, they would explode after seven seconds), and doing so would inevitably lead to sacrifice. Comrade Xu looked around and felt that if he went back to find the detonating cord, it would delay the entire battle and increase the casualties of more comrades, so Comrade Xu Hanlin, a Communist Party member and a good son of the people, like countless revolutionary martyrs, with a fearless spirit of self-sacrifice, contributed his most precious life for the complete liberation of Guangxi people. He slammed the grenade and ignited the explosives; with a deafening roar, the bunker, the walls, and more than 20 enemies and a heavy machine gun were all lifted and destroyed. The glorious warrior—Comrade Xu Hanlin shed his last drop of blood in completing his mission. One minute later, the warriors occupied the enemy position, and the bright red flag was planted on the top of Pangu Mountain. In just half an hour, more than 70 people, including Lu Lansheng, the political director of the puppet regiment, were killed on the spot, and 300 people, including Huang Shuo, the puppet regiment commander, were captured. One machine gun, one grenade launcher, three light machine guns, one automatic rifle, two submachine guns, and 148 rifles and pistols were seized. The enemy was completely annihilated. And the heroic name of Comrade Xu Hanlin will forever live in the hearts of the people of Guangxi!

　　这就是共产党员！
    ——徐汉林舍生炸碉堡的壮烈事迹
    英勇的人民战士徐汉林同志是旅顺二支队一大队六连七班副班长，中国共产党员，解放天津的战役中的人民功臣。他在九月二十三日围歼盘踞在灵山西北盘古村的敌人的战斗中，表现了惊人的勇敢和阶级战士的高贵品质，牺牲自己的宝贵生命，炸毁碉堡，使一个团共三百余土匪全部就歼，为剿匪部队建立了永垂不朽的功劳。
    盘古村地势险要，坐落在南山山坡。匪“反共救国军”十九师七十四团全部三百余人，盘踞该村，并在南山的山顶上修筑了强固的工事。除外壕及地道外，还建筑了三个高大碉堡，围墙连接成一个月牙式阵地。前面是两道比人还高、两公尺厚的荆棘刺树鹿砦，一道成半圆形围着碉堡，一道离碉堡十多公尺。山高二百多公尺，在陡斜的山坡上长满着草丛荆棘，几乎没法攀登。匪徒依仗这险要地势和坚固工事，疯狂糟蹋四周群众，奸淫抢掠，无恶不作；一个月之内，即抢杀群众耕牛三十头之多。人民无法生活。
    九月二十二日拂晓，我旅顺二支队一大队将该匪团团围住。但因南山山顶匪火力猛烈，部队不能接近。此时，六连的勇士们，勇敢的接受了攻夺制高点南山的光荣任务。他们在连长王开来、指导员杨景尧率领下，以快速的动作，进行猛攻，反复冲杀五次，仍未奏效。这时营党委发出紧急号召，要求六连不惜一切牺牲拿下山头。
    六连全体同志，坚决地响应了这一号召，在营首长面前宣誓：“完不成任务不回来。”组织了以共产党员为骨干的十位勇士的突击班，三人带冲锋枪，三人带炸药，四人带步枪手榴弹，由一班班长王森同志率领，在营的猛烈火力掩护下，继续展开猛攻。但敌人的子弹从四面八方射来，王森同志牺牲了，紧接着两个同志又倒下了，有两个带炸药的战士也负伤了，但战士们仍踏着烈士们的血迹奋勇爬进。越爬越近了，离敌人碉堡约三十多米达处，前进就更困难了。班长跟徐汉林同志合计着首先炸垮敌碉，然后冲占阵地。战士们争着要担任炸破任务。
    徐汉林同志首先把三十多斤炸药和四个手榴弹抢在手里。班长亲切地交代他说：“好，去吧！我们一定支援你，光荣地完成党的任务！”徐汉林同志响亮地回答说：“好！一定不给党丢人！”在战士们紧紧的掩护下，徐汉林同志以机智敏捷的动作，连滚带爬地冲上去，一连钻过两道鹿砦。他伏在碉堡下面，细细检查自己的炸药，发觉炸药的拉绳不知什么时候丢了。这真急坏了徐同志。情急智生，他决定把手榴弹塞进炸药里，以手榴弹的爆炸去引导炸药的爆炸。但拉手榴弹距爆发时间是很短的，只有三秒钟的时间（如果炸药有导火线，则可在七秒钟后爆炸），这样做是无法避免牺牲的。徐同志看了看四周，觉得如果再回去找拉绳，就会延误整个战斗时间，增加更多同志的伤亡，于是共产党员，人民的好儿子徐汉林同志，像无数先烈们所表现的那样，以大无畏的自我牺牲精神，为广西人民的彻底解放，贡献出自己最宝贵的生命。他摔响了手榴弹，燃着了炸药；轰然一声巨响，碉堡、围墙，连二十多个敌人、一挺重机枪，全部飞腾了，毁灭了。光荣的勇士——徐汉林同志在完成任务中流了最后一滴血。一分钟后，勇士们占领了敌阵，鲜红的旗子插在盘古山顶了。只有半个钟头光景，伪团政治处主任陆兰生以下七十余人被当场打死，伪团长黄硕德以下三百人当了俘虏，缴获机关炮一门，掷弹筒一个，轻机枪三挺，自动步枪一支，冲锋枪二支，长短枪一百四十八支。敌人被歼无一漏网。而徐汉林同志的英名永远活在广西人民的心中！
