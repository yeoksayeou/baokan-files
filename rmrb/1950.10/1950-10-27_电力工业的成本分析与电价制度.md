　　Cost Analysis and Electricity Pricing System in the Power Industry
　　Xie Peihe
　　I. Analysis of Power Industry Costs
　　The production of the power industry is the same as that of other industries - it requires certain machinery, equipment, and raw materials, plus human labor to produce. However, it has two characteristics: (1) The product of the power industry, "electricity," cannot be stored and must be used as it is produced. Storage batteries have limited applications due to high cost and small capacity, and are not sufficient to affect this characteristic. (2) Power lines and equipment are spread over a wide area, and the utilization rate of machinery and equipment is closely related to the needs of each region. They must be properly coordinated to achieve economical operation and reduce costs. Therefore, within a certain area, the power industry is a monopolistic public utility.
　　The vast majority of China's power industry is operated by the state, and the private sector also operates in accordance with the New Democratic economic policy, so naturally, it will not purely focus on its own interests and engage in monopolistic practices. However, while taking care of other industries and general users, it is essential to pay close attention to how to ensure the development of the power industry itself, how to maintain safe power supply, and how to cover all expenses during the expanded reproduction process, so that the fixed investment of the power industry can be recovered. The key to this is to strictly follow the principles of enterprise management, accurately calculate costs, add reasonable profits, and formulate appropriate electricity prices.
　　Power industry costs include the following three types:
　　(1) Consumption Costs: These are the expenses that must be paid during the production process. This type of expense is directly proportional to the amount of electricity consumed by users and is not related to the capacity of the user's electrical equipment. In other words, for every additional unit of electricity used by a user, the power company incurs an additional unit of cost (fuel costs can be used as a representative).
　　(2) Customer Costs: These are the expenses that increase or decrease based on the number of users. This type of cost is not related to the amount of electricity consumed or the capacity required by users. Even if a user does not use a single unit of electricity, the power company still needs to pay these expenses (sales expenses can be used as a representative, such as meter reading and billing).
　　(3) Demand Costs: These are the expenses incurred to prepare for the supply of capacity required by users at any time. They account for a large proportion of the total cost, and depreciation and interest on power generation, transmission, and transformation equipment can be used as a representative. This type of cost is similar to customer costs, i.e., even if the user does not use any electricity, the power company still needs to pay for the investment and maintenance of the required equipment.
　　The above analysis of the three types of costs illustrates that the cost of selling electricity for lighting and the cost of selling electricity for power generated by the same generator are different, and the cost of power also varies depending on the length of use and the amount of electricity used.
　　II. How to Formulate a Reasonable Electricity Pricing System?
　　When studying the electricity pricing system, the following three principles must be considered:
　　(1) Due to the different times and amounts of electricity used by various users, the costs required also vary. Among the above three types of costs, customer costs and demand costs are fixed under the condition that the user's electricity capacity remains unchanged. Therefore, the longer the electricity is used, the lower the average total cost per unit of electricity. For example, general lighting users only use electricity for a few hours a day, while power users use electricity for a longer time. Therefore, the total cost per unit of electricity for lighting users should be higher than that for power users.
　　The level of electricity costs, in addition to being determined by the power industry's own machinery and equipment, operational technical standards, management systems, and the consciousness and work efforts of employees, there are also two factors on the user side that can affect the power industry's costs.
　　A. Capacity Factors: The more electricity a user needs, the larger the power company's equipment capacity, the lower the average equipment cost per horsepower (or per kilowatt), and the less fuel, materials, and labor are consumed per unit of electricity, thus lowering the power industry's costs. Therefore, whether or not large-capacity users use electricity can often affect the overall cost of the power industry.
　　B. Time Factors: The power industry's load fluctuates all the time, usually with certain patterns. On a daily basis, the load is highest in the evening in areas with many lighting users and lowest from midnight to the evening of the next day. In areas with many factory users, the load may be highest in the morning. On a weekly basis, the load is usually lowest on Sundays. Seasonally, the load is lower in summer and autumn. However, the power plant's machinery and equipment must be sufficient to meet the highest load. Therefore, if users use electricity during periods of low load and excess electricity, the power supplied by the power company will only slightly increase limited consumption costs, and the power industry's total cost can be reduced as a result.
　　(2) At present, the equipment capacity of China's power industry is still not large, and the various industries that are vigorously recovering and developing have a strong need for electricity. Therefore, it is necessary to coordinate with the country's overall construction policy and supply electricity with emphasis based on the actual conditions of each region. Industries such as heavy industry, national defense industry, and industries that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood should be encouraged to use more electricity, and their electricity needs should be given priority. For non-essential and other luxury goods industries, the electricity price can be appropriately increased or even not provided. As for residential and commercial lighting, it is currently not possible to encourage more use. Therefore, the formulation of electricity prices must be combined with the principle of prioritized power supply.
　　(3) At present, not only is the total capacity of China's power equipment not large, but it has also not achieved full utilization of existing equipment. According to statistics from the Central Fuel Industry Department, the average utilization rate in North China in 1949 was only 2,480 kWh per kilowatt per year based on power generation capacity, and it is estimated that it can be increased to 3,020 kWh in 1950. The average utilization rate of the main state-owned power industries in Northeast and East China is even lower than that in North China. However, the average annual utilization rate of the general power industry in the Soviet Union is as high as 6,000 kWh. Taking only the average annual utilization rate of North China, if it is increased to the Soviet standard, it would be equivalent to doubling the power generation capacity. Therefore, the formulation of electricity prices in China must have the effect of stimulating production and increasing the utilization rate, so that the power industry can closely cooperate with other industries and accelerate development.
　　III. Overview of Electricity Pricing Systems
　　The general electricity pricing systems currently in use are no more than the following:
　　(1) Fixed Electricity Price System: This means charging a monthly fee based on the size of the equipment capacity, regardless of the amount of electricity consumed, such as monthly lighting and monthly power. The only advantage of this system is that it can save a large number of electricity meters. However, it inevitably leads to the waste of electricity.
　　(2) Simple Electricity Consumption System: This means charging fees only based on the amount of electricity consumed, regardless of the size of the equipment capacity. Although this system avoids the waste of electricity, it requires the installation of a large number of electricity meters. If users use too little electricity or do not use any at all, the power company's fixed costs (customer costs and demand costs) cannot be recovered.
　　(3) Three-Part Electricity Price System: This is based on the separate calculation of "consumption," "customer," and "demand" costs, i.e., the sum of electricity, customer, and basic fees (total electricity bill). This system is the most reasonable, but it is rarely adopted because its calculation method is too complicated, or even because it increases customer costs.
　　(4) Two-Part Electricity Price System: This means combining the sum of "demand" and "customer" costs as a basic fee and using "consumption costs" as the electricity fee. The sum of the basic fee and the electricity fee is the total electricity bill. This system will be explained separately later.
　　(5) Minimum Charge System: This means that each user has a limit on the minimum amount of electricity consumed (minimum charge). If the user's electricity consumption is less than the minimum charge, they are charged according to the minimum charge. If it exceeds the minimum charge, it is calculated according to the actual amount of electricity consumed. Although this system has the meaning of taking into account "demand costs," its effect is not significant. The adoption of this system in China (especially for lighting users) is relatively common.
　　In addition, there are also those who raise the electricity price within the minimum consumption to be particularly higher than the electricity price for the remaining electricity. However, this system has not yet been adopted in China.
　　In addition to the fixed electricity price system, the above electricity pricing systems have linear, stepped, and block-rate distinctions for the calculation of basic fees and electricity fees. In terms of basic fees, they are generally block-rate decreasing; in terms of electricity fees, there are block-rate increasing and block-rate decreasing.
　　[Note: Block-rate increasing means that several units (e.g., ten or twenty units) of electricity are taken as a stage, and the electricity price of each stage is different. The more electricity is used, the electricity price increases sequentially according to the stage; block-rate decreasing is the opposite, the more electricity is used, the electricity price decreases sequentially according to the stage.]
　　IV. Current Situation of Electricity Pricing System
　　The electricity pricing systems in various parts of China are extremely inconsistent. Except for the three-part electricity price system, which has not yet been adopted, and a few areas that have adopted a simple electricity consumption system, the remaining three systems are widely used in various places. Even in the same area, two or three different systems are used at the same time.
　　In China, the fixed electricity price system is only used for lighting (i.e., monthly lighting) except for Northeast China, where monthly power is adopted. However, areas that adopt this system also have a method of charging fees based on the number of units seen on the electricity meter.
　　The two-part electricity price system was commonly used among power users before the Anti-Japanese War, but it was later changed to the minimum charge system during the Anti-Japanese War and has been promoted to this day. However, it is rarely used for lighting users (only Northeast China and Yantai adopt it).
　　The minimum charge system is very commonly used in both power and lighting users in inland China, except for the Northeast region.
　　In some areas, such as Lushun, Dalian, Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Wuhan, and Guangzhou, the calculation of electricity fees for lighting users still follows the block-rate increasing system during the Anti-Japanese War. The calculation of electricity fees for large power users in Qingdao and power users in Xi'an and Lanzhou adopts a block-rate decreasing system, with the aim of stimulating industrial production and increasing the utilization rate of power equipment.
　　According to incomplete data, the Soviet Union's electricity pricing system is: generally, power users with a power consumption capacity of more than 50 kVA adopt the two-part electricity price system. Small power users with less than 50 kVA only charge electricity fees; and different electricity prices are set according to the nature of various users and their relationship with the national economy and people's livelihood.
　　In the Moscow region, the electricity price for agricultural power users is similar to that for ordinary small power users. The electricity price for public transportation is lower than that for ordinary small power users. General lighting users are further divided into many categories, with the lowest being about 50% higher than ordinary small power users.
　　Generally speaking, the lighting electricity price in the Soviet Union is consistent nationwide. It is divided into the following categories according to the nature of the users, and the electricity prices increase sequentially. The ratio between the lowest and the highest is about one to seven.
　　(1) Villages and towns (mostly places where workers, peasants, and soldiers live).
　　(2) General housing, farms, dormitories, etc.
　　(3) Various transportation stations (such as train stations and wharves), nurseries, children's theaters, and cinemas, etc.
　　(4) Street lights.
　　(5) Schools, research institutes, experimental institutes, cultural centers, libraries, cooperatives, public undertakings, public clubs, parks, assembly halls, museums, gymnasiums, bathhouses, and pharmacies, etc.
　　(6) Hotels, barber shops, photo studios, parking lots, and commercial warehouses, etc.
　　(7) Theaters and circuses, etc.
　　(8) Apartments, restaurants, cafes, and racetracks, etc.
　　(9) Religious organizations, etc.
　　From this, it can be seen that the formulation of electricity prices in the Soviet Union first takes care of the needs of the general public's life, followed by children, culture, and health. For non-essential consumption or nearly extravagant electricity use, the electricity price is set higher. This is very reasonable and necessary.
　　V. Electricity Pricing System to be Adopted in China
　　Based on the above points, it can be seen the importance of the power industry in economic construction and the general situation of China's power industry. But how should we cultivate China's power industry and gradually develop it? Undoubtedly, we should adopt the most reasonable electricity pricing system and business policy, so that the power equipment can be used most economically and promote China's industry to embark on the road of electrification as soon as possible.
　　According to the advanced electricity pricing system implemented by the Soviet Union, we believe that areas in China that have not yet implemented the two-part charging system can first adopt the two-part electricity price system for large power users with more than 50 horsepower (or 50 kilowatts). This system divides the electricity bill borne by the user into two parts: fixed costs and variable costs. Fixed costs, also known as basic fees, refer to the fixed "demand costs" and "customer costs" that the power company must pay for installing fixed power equipment for each user and fulfilling its fixed work in each month or specified period, regardless of whether the user uses electricity or not. Variable costs are consumption costs, also known as electricity fees (or floating electricity fees). The sum of the basic fee and the electricity fee is the total electricity bill. The basic fee is calculated monthly (or annually) per horsepower (or per kilowatt) according to the user's equipment capacity (or maximum power consumption capacity). The electricity fee is calculated according to the amount of electricity consumed.
　　We suggest adopting a two-part electricity price system for larger power users for the following reasons:
　　(1) To ensure the recovery of the power industry's fixed costs and the enterprise management of the power industry; that is, to ensure the reliability of the power industry's service to the people.
　　(2) To compress peak loads and increase the load factor of power equipment; that is, to increase the utilization rate of people's resources.
　　(3) To reduce the waste caused by users' power equipment exceeding actual needs, and to avoid the phenomenon of too low a power industry load power factor (or power factor).
　　(4) The calculation of electricity price costs is more realistic. Therefore, it can make the user's burden of electricity fees fair and reasonable.
　　(5) When the equipment capacity is fixed, the more electricity is used, the lower the average electricity price per unit. Therefore, it can stimulate industrial and mining electricity use and increase production. And it can improve the utilization rate of power and user equipment.
　　At present, many areas in China adopt the minimum charge system for power users. It is certainly difficult to suddenly change to the two-part electricity price system. Because under the minimum charge system, the general minimum consumption is very small. As long as it exceeds the minimum consumption, the average electricity price per unit of electricity is the same, regardless of how much electricity the user uses. For example, there are two users, A and B, whose installed equipment capacity (or maximum power consumption capacity) is the same, and their electricity consumption also exceeds the minimum consumption. However, because the electricity consumption time of user A is longer than that of user B, the amount of electricity consumed is greater. If calculated according to the minimum charge system, the average electricity price per unit of electricity for users A and B is the same. But in fact, user A has increased a part of the additional burden, while user B has less burdened a part of the expenses that should have been paid. In other words, user A has borne a part of the expenses for user B. If calculated according to the two-part electricity price system, the average electricity price per unit of electricity for user A is lower than that for user B. Therefore, if the original minimum charge system is changed to the two-part electricity price system, if the electricity consumption of users A and B remains unchanged, the electricity price of user A will definitely decrease, and the electricity price of user B will increase compared to the original minimum charge system. This will cause some power users with lower equipment utilization rates to have difficulties in increasing their burden. However, for the sake of the overall long-term interests, this difficulty should be overcome by the joint efforts of users and power companies. On the user side, they should try to increase the electricity consumption time and reduce the unnecessary equipment capacity; on the power company side, they can set a time limit for those users who will increase their burden, so that they can improve their electricity consumption conditions - increase the utilization rate to reduce the burden. As for the electricity pricing system for smaller power users, it can be decided according to the actual situation.
　　Although the fixed electricity price system currently adopted for lighting users is unreasonable, it is not convenient to eliminate it suddenly before China mass-produces electricity meters. However, efforts should be made to improve it under possible conditions.
　　Since the electricity consumption of lighting users is mostly limited by natural conditions, and the difference in utilization rates between users is also very limited, there is no need to adopt a two-part electricity price system. As for whether to adopt a simple electricity consumption system or a minimum charge system? It can be determined according to the actual situation of each place. In areas where electricity prices are low and users use more electricity, there is no real difference between adopting either of these two systems.
　　Electric heating is divided into household and industrial use. In China, the general practice is to charge household electric heating according to lighting and industrial electric heating according to power. It is still reasonable to adopt this method in the current situation of insufficient power.
　　Regarding the tiered methods of various electricity fees. According to the two important factors of electricity consumption capacity and time mentioned in section III (1), in order to make the burden between various users fair and reasonable and to increase the effect of the two-part electricity price system to stimulate electricity consumption, the basic fees and electricity fees for larger power users should be graded and block-rate decreasing. For large users with particularly large capacity, extremely high equipment utilization rates, or electricity consumption times that are particularly beneficial to the power industry, contracts can be signed separately, and they are not subject to these general regulations. Because whether these users use electricity and how much electricity they use can often affect the power industry's overall costs and the economic operation of equipment.
　　In the current situation in China where electricity is not yet sufficiently widespread, a linear charging system can be adopted for electricity consumption by lighting users. Depending on the different conditions in various places, a block-rate increasing method can be adopted if there is a need to restrict use.
　　In terms of business policy: for power users, electricity supply should be focused on key areas according to the country's overall construction policy and the needs of the people, and a strict electricity consumption management system should be established to improve the utilization rate of equipment and promote industrial production and development. For lighting users, different electricity prices should be formulated separately according to the nature of the users, in accordance with the New Democratic policy and guidelines. Try to take care of the daily needs of the people and related public transportation, culture, education, health, and other undertakings. For undertakings that are not necessary for the daily lives of the general public and are not beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, it may be possible to increase their electricity fees or even stipulate that they are not allowed to use electricity, so as to restrict them.

　　电力工业的成本分析与电价制度
    谢佩和
    一、电力工业成本的分析
    电力工业的生产也和其他工业的生产相同——需要有一定的机器设备和原材料，再加上人的劳动力才可生产。但它却具有两个特点：（一）电力工业的产品“电”是不能储存的，必须随产随用。所谓蓄电池因成本高、容量小，故适用的范围有限，也不足以影响这个特点的存在。（二）电业线路设备遍布广阔的地区，机器设备的利用率和各该地区的需要量有密切的关系，必须适当地互相配合，才能达到经济运用与减低成本的目的。因此，在一定地区内电力工业是独占性的公用事业。
    我国电力事业绝大部分由国家经营，私营部分也依照新民主主义经济政策办理，自然不会纯粹从本身利益着眼，发生独占的情形。但于照顾其他工业和一般用户之中，如何保证电业自身的发展，如何维持安全供电及扩大再生产过程中的一切费用，使电力工业的固定投资得以收回，实应密切注意；而其主要关键，在严格依照企业化的原则，精确计算成本，附加合理的利润，以订出适当的电价。
    电业成本包括下列三种：
    （一）消耗成本：即在生产过程中必须支出的费用。此种费用与用户用电度数的多寡成正比例，而与用户用电设备容量的大小无关。换言之，即用户多用一度电，电业机构即多支出一度电的成本（可以燃料费用为代表）。
    （二）用户成本：即按用户的多少而增减的费用。此种成本与用户用电度数和需电容量都没有关系，即使用户一度电未用，电业机构仍需照支（可以营业费用为代表，如抄表及收费工作等）。
    （三）需要成本：这是为准备随时供给用户所需的容量而支出的费用。在总成本中所占的比率很大，可以发、送、变电等设备的折旧利息作为代表。此种费用和用户成本相似，即使用户全未用电，而电业机构对所需设备的投资和维持费用仍需照支。
    由于上述三种成本的分析，说明了：由同一发电机所发出的电力对于电灯的售电成本和电力的售电成本是不同的，而电力与电力之间的成本亦因用电时间的长短和用电的多寡而有不同。
    二、如何订定合理的电价制度？
    研究电价制度时，必须考虑到下列三个原则：
    （一）由于各用户间用电的时间和用电量的不同，所需的成本亦各异。在上述三种成本中，用户成本和需要成本在用户用电容量不变的条件下是固定的。所以用电时间愈长，平均每度电的总成本愈少。例如：一般的电灯用户每天用电仅数小时，而电力用户用电的时间较长，因此，电灯用户每度电的总成本应较电力用户为高。
    电业成本的高低，除由于电力工业本身的机器设备、运行技术标准、管理制度以及职工的觉悟和工作的努力程度而决定外，在用户方面也有两种因素足以影响电业的成本。
    甲、容量上的因素：用户需电愈多，则电业的设备容量愈大，平均每马力（或每千瓦）的设备费及每度电所耗的燃料、材料和人力亦愈少，因而电业成本愈低。故容量大的用户用电与否往往可影响整个电业的成本。
    乙、时间上的因素：电业的负荷时时刻刻在变动，通常有一定的规律。以每天而论，在电灯用户多的地区晚间的负荷最高，午夜至次日黄昏前最低；在工厂用户多的地区则可能在上午的负荷最高。以每周而论，约以星期日的负荷为最低。以季节而论，则以夏秋季的负荷较低。但电厂的机器设备必须要足够应付最高的负荷。所以用户如果在负荷低、电量有余的时候用电，则电业机构所供应的这一部分的电，因仅略增加有限的消耗成本，电业的总成本可赖以降低。
    （二）目前我国电力工业的设备容量还不大，而正在大力恢复发展中的各地工业需电颇殷。所以必须配合国家整个的建设方针，结合各地区的实际情况有重点地供应。如重工业、国防工业以及有利于国计民生的工业，应鼓励其多用电，并尽先供应其电力的需要。对非民生所必需和其他奢侈品工业，可将电价酌予提高或竟不予使用。至于住宅和商店的照明用电，在目前还不能鼓励多用。故在订定电价时必须与重点供电的原则结合起来。
    （三）目前我国不但电业设备的总容量不大，而且还没有做到充分地利用现有设备。据中央燃料工业部的统计：华北区一九四九年的平均利用率根据发电容量计算，每千瓦全年发电仅为二千四百八十度，估计一九五○年可提高至三千零二十度。东北、华东主要国营电力工业的平均利用率还低于华北。而苏联一般的电力工业每年的平均利用率即高达六千度。仅以华北的每年平均利用率计，如提高至苏联的标准，就等于将发电容量增加了一倍。所以我国的电价的订定一定要有刺激生产和增加利用率的作用，才能使电业与其他工业密切配合，加速发展。
    三、电价制度概述
    现在一般的电价制度不外下列各种：
    （一）定额电价制度：这就是不论消费电度多少，按其设备容量的大小按月收费。如包月灯和包月电力等。这种制度的惟一优点，就是可以节省大量的电度表。但却不免因此而浪费了电力。
    （二）单纯消费电度制：即不论设备容量的大小，仅按其消耗的度数计收电费。这种制度虽然避免了电力的浪费，但需要装置大量的电度表。如用户用电过少或竟不用，则电业机构的固定消耗（用户成本和需要成本）即无从取偿。
    （三）三部电价制：系根据“消耗”、“用户”和“需要”三种成本分别计算，亦即电度、用户和基本三种费用的总和（总电费）。此种制度最为合理，但因其计算方法过于复杂，或甚至因此而增加了用户成本，故采用者极少。
    （四）二部电价制：即将“需要”和“用户”两种成本的和作为基本费，以“消耗成本”作为电度费，将基本费与电度费相加，合而为总电费。关于此种制度，后面将予单独说明。
    （五）底度费制：即每一用户有一最少用电度数的限制（底度）。如用户用电不及底度时亦按底度收费，如超过底度时则按其实际用电度数计算。这种制度虽有照顾到“需要成本”的意义，但作用并不大。我国采用这种制度的（尤其是对电灯用户采用这种制度的）却比较普遍。
    此外，还有将底度度数内的电价较其余电度的电价特别提高者。但在我国还没有采用这种制度的。
    以上各种电价制度，除定额电价制外，对于基本费及电度费的计算都有直线式、阶段式和块量式的分别。在基本费方面，一般都是块量递减；在电度费方面，又分块量递增和块量递减两种。
    【注：块量递增即以若干度（例如十度或二十度）电为一阶段，每阶段的电价都不同，用电愈多则电价按阶段依次增加；块量递减则反之，用电愈多，电价按照阶段依次减少。】
    四、现行电价制度的情况
    我国各地的电价制度极不一致，除三部电价制尚无采用者及少数地区采用了单纯消费电度制外，其余三种制度均在各地普遍采用，甚至有在同一地区同时采用两种或三种不同制度的情形。
    定额电价制在我国除东北有采用包月电力者外，其他地区仅用于照明（即包月电灯）。但采用这种制度的地区同时也有装电度表按抄见度数计费的办法。
    二部电价制度曾于抗战前在电力用户中普遍采用过，后来在抗战时期又改用底度制，推行至今。但用于电灯用户的极少（仅东北与烟台采用）。
    底度费制除东北区外，在关内无论是电力抑或电灯用户均极普遍采用。
    若干地区如旅顺、大连、北京、天津、济南、西安、兰州、武汉及广州等地，对于电灯用户电度费的计算仍沿用抗战时期的块量递增制度。青岛的大电力用户及西安、兰州等地的电力用户，电度费的计算则采用块量递减制，其目的在刺激工业生产与增加电业设备的利用率。
    根据不完全的资料，苏联的电价制度是：一般电力用户其用电容量超过五十个千伏安的采用二部电价制。不满五十个千伏安的小电力用户，仅收取电度费；并按照各类用户的性质和视其与国计民生的关系而订定不同的电价。
    在莫斯科地区，农业电力用户的电价和普通小电力用户相仿。公用交通事业的电价则较普通小电力用户为低。一般电灯用户更分为很多类，最低的较普通小电力用户约高百分之五十。
    苏联全国的电灯电价一般地说来是一致的。它根据用户的性质分为下列各类电价依次递增，其最低与最高之比约为一比七。
    （１）村镇（大多为工农兵集居的地方）。
    （２）一般住房、农场、宿舍等。
    （３）各种交通站（如车站码头等）、托儿所、儿童剧院及电影院等。
    （４）路灯。
    （５）学校、研究所、试验所、文化馆、图书馆、合作社、公营事业、公共俱乐部、公园、大会堂、博物馆、体育馆、浴室及药房等。
    （６）旅馆、理发馆、照像馆、停汽车处及商用货栈等。
    （７）剧院及马戏团等。
    （８）公寓、餐馆、咖啡馆及跑马场等。
    （９）宗教团体等。
    由此可见苏联电价的订定，首先是照顾到一般人民生活的需要，其次是儿童、文化及卫生等方面。而对于非大众生活所必需的消耗或近于奢侈的用电，其电价则定得较高。这是十分合理的，也是必要的。
    五、我国应采取的电价制度
    根据上述各点，可以看出电力工业在经济建设中的重要性和我国电力工业的一般情况。但究应如何来培养我国的电力工业并使其逐渐发展呢？无疑地，我们应该采取最合理的电价制度和营业方针，才能使电业设备得到最经济的使用，促使我国工业早日走上电气化的道路。
    根据苏联所实行的先进的电价制度，我们认为国内各地尚未实行二部收费制的地区，可先对于五十马力（或五十千瓦）以上的大电力用户采取二部电价制。此项制度，是将用户所负担的电费分为固定费用和不固定费用两部分。固定费用也称为基本费，系指电业机构因必须为每一用户装设固定的用电设备，同时无论用户用电与否，在每月或规定的时期内，必须履行其固定的工作所支出的固定的“需要成本”和“用户成本”。不固定费用就是消耗费用，也称为电度费（或称流动电费）。基本费与电度费的和就是总电费。基本费是按照用户的设备容量（或最高用电容量）每月（或每年）每马力（或每千瓦）计算的。电度费是按照用电度数计算的。
    我们建议对较大的电力用户采取二部电价制的理由如下：
    （一）保证电业固定费用的收回和电业经营的企业化；也就是保证电力工业为人民服务的可靠性。
    （二）可以压缩尖头负荷，提高电业设备的负荷率；也就是增加人民资材的利用率。
    （三）可减少因用户用电设备超出实际需要的浪费，并可避免电业负荷力率（或称电力因数）太低的现象。
    （四）电价成本的计算比较切合实际。因此，可使用户对电费的负担公平合理。
    （五）在设备容量固定的情况下，用电愈多则平均每度电价愈低。因此，可以刺激工矿用电，增加生产。并可提高电业及用户设备的利用率。
    目前在我国有很多地区对电力用户是采取底度费制的。如骤然改为二部电价制，当然是有困难的。因为在底度费制下，一般的底度度数是很少的，只要超过了底度，不论用户用电的多寡，每度电的平均电价都是相同的。例如：有甲乙两用户，其装置的设备容量（或最高用电容量）相同，用电也都超过了底度，但甲户因用电时间较乙户为长，用电度数较多。如果按底度费制计算，则甲乙两户每度电的平均电价是相同的。但实际上是甲户增加了一部分额外的负担，而乙户则少负担了一部分应有费用。换言之，就是甲户代乙户多负担了一部分费用。如按二部电价制计算，则甲户每度电的平均电价较乙户为低。因此，如将原采用的底度费制改为二部电价制时，倘甲乙两户用电的情况仍然不变，则甲户的电价必将减低，而乙户的电价将比原来采用底度制时增高，因而将使一部分设备利用率较低的电力用户有增加负担的困难。但为了整个的长远利益，这一困难是应当由用户与电业机构共同努力克服的。在用户方面应设法增加用电时间，减少可省却的设备容量；在电业机构方面可对这些将要增加负担的用户酌定期限，使其得以改善自己的用电条件——增加利用率，以减低负担。至于较小电力用户的电价制度，可按实际的情况斟酌决定。
    目前对电灯用户所采用的定额电价制虽欠合理，但在我国还未大量制造电度表以前，一时不便骤然淘汰。但在可能条件下应力图改善。
    电灯用户的用电既大部分受天然条件的限制，且用户之间的利用率相差也极有限，故无采用二部电价制的必要。至于究应采取单纯消费电度制抑或采取底度费制？可根据各地的实际情况而定。在电价低廉和用户用电较多的地区，则在这两种制度中无论采取那一种，在实质上都没有什么区别。
    电热用电不外分家用和工业用两种。在我国一般的习惯是：家用电热按电灯计费，工业用电热按电力计费。在目前电力不足的情况下采用这种办法尚属合理。
    关于各种电费的分级办法。根据第三节第（一）项所述的用电容量和时间两个重要因素，为了使各用户之间的负担公平合理，并增加二部电价制刺激用电的作用，对于较大电力用户的基本费和电度费都应该分级采取块量递减的办法。对容量特大或设备利用率特高或用电时间对电业特别有利的大用户，可另行订立契约，不受这种一般规定的限制。因这种用户的用电与否与用电多寡往往可以影响电业整个的成本和设备的经济运转。
    在目前我国电力尚不十分普遍充裕的情况下，对电灯用户的用电可采取直线式收费制度。按各地情况的不同，如有限制使用的必要，可采取块量递增的办法。
    在营业方针方面：对电力用户应根据国家整个的建设方针和人民的需要有重点地供应用电，并建立严格的用电管理制度，以提高设备的利用率，并促进工业的生产和发展。对电灯用户应根据新民主主义的政策和方针，按用户性质的不同而分别订定不同的电价。尽量照顾到人民日常的需要和有关公共交通、文化、教育、卫生等事业。对于非人民大众日常生活所必需和与国计民生无益的事业，则不妨将其电费予以提高，或竟规定不予用电，以资限制。
