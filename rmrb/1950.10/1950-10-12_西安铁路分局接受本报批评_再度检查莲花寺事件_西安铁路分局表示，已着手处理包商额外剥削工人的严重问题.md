　　Editor's Note: After this newspaper published news on June 14th about the cruel exploitation of workers by contractors at the Lianhuasi Quarry under the jurisdiction of the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau, the acting director of the sub-bureau, Yuan Boyang, and others sent a letter to this newspaper on June 23rd, expressing sincere acceptance of the criticism and stating: "The problem of contractors' extra exploitation of workers has been initially corrected." However, on August 6th, this newspaper received a joint letter from the Political Department of a certain artillery regiment and the Huaxian County Federation of Trade Unions in Shaanxi Province, reflecting that the contractors' extra exploitation of workers at the Lianhuasi Quarry had not stopped. This newspaper published the letter on August 26th and pointed out that the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau's acceptance of criticism was not serious enough, and hoped that they would conduct a serious self-criticism in this rectification movement. On September 13th, the sub-bureau sent a letter to this newspaper, expressing acceptance of the criticism and further reviewing its work, determined to correct its shortcomings. Excerpts from the letter are as follows.
　　To the Comrades of the People's Daily Editorial Department:
　　In late April, People's Daily reporter Comrade Chen Ji discovered the serious problem of contractors' extra exploitation of workers at the Lianhuasi Quarry. Based on this information, the sub-bureau immediately sent a working group to conduct an in-depth investigation. At that time, the Huaxian County Federation of Trade Unions had already sent personnel to Lianhuasi to organize a trade union and had elected worker representatives. We, together with the trade union, on the one hand, helped workers to settle accounts with team leaders and contractors for wages and food, and on the other hand, educated the contractors, so that they would increase the workers' wages by reducing the "management" fee and "tool" fee of half a jin of flour per cubic meter of stone. We also formulated 18 "Production Pledges" aimed at the undesirable phenomena in the quarry, stipulating that contractors should not carry out extra exploitation, guaranteeing the workers' due wages, and establishing some democratic systems, as well as determining the political treatment of workers. These regulations were officially announced and implemented by Director He of the Huaxian County Federation of Trade Unions at a workers' meeting on May 17th, and were unanimously supported by the workers. Comrade Wang Zhiheng, Deputy Director of the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau, and Comrade Qin Ying, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, also expressed their apologies for the inadequate care for the workers. The meeting also exposed the facts of the contractors' cruel exploitation, and based on the opinions of the masses and conclusive evidence, sent individual team leaders with serious crimes to the government for legal action. After the meeting, the person in charge of the contractor, worker representatives, and the director of the trade union jointly signed and sealed the pledge, and it was decided that the trade union would be responsible for supervising its implementation. The Lianhuasi issue came to an end at this point. We said "initial solution achieved" in the review submitted to the People's Daily based on this situation.
　　After the working group returned to the bureau on May 20th, the Huaxian resident trade union was virtually dissolved, and the "Production Pledges" could not be implemented due to lack of supervision. On May 25th, although the sub-bureau sent Comrade Wang Baoquan to Lianhuasi to establish a joint office, the main task assigned to him by the sub-bureau was to solve the problem of production and transportation relations (at that time, the coordination between production and transportation was insufficient, and the rubble could not be transported out according to plan, which affected the flood control task), and the second task was to deal with the contractor's exploitation of workers. After the establishment of the joint office, by the end of August, although some workers had been organized to democratically elect team leaders to manage food and wages themselves, and the embezzlement and exploitation cases of Rongji team leader Miao Deshi, Li Qiang, Zhao Rongguang and others had been settled, and more than 19,000 jin of flour had been recovered. Also, one doctor and two nurses were sent by the railway bureau to treat the workers' illnesses. And in resolving countless disputes between workers and contractors, the interests of some workers were reasonably protected. However, this only solved part of the problems for some workers, and did not truly organize the workers, and the contractors did not seriously fulfill the "Production Pledges," so the situation of workers suffering from feudal exploitation basically remained unchanged.
　　After the Lianhuasi Quarry issue came to an end, similar incidents were also discovered in other quarries. The leadership of the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau felt that the malpractices of the contractor system were too many, and a few "Pledges" could not solve all the problems. Therefore, on the one hand, it requested the help of the Labor Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee to find appropriate solutions, and on the other hand, it sent people to the old liberated areas in northern Henan to organize stonemasons, preparing to gradually abolish the contractors. In the end, because the leadership had not clearly recognized the seriousness of the problem, it failed to treat this problem with a serious and responsible attitude and spirit; moreover, it incorrectly believed that the railway bureau and the contractors were mainly in a trading relationship, and that the organization of trade unions and the opposition to feudal exploitation by contractors should be the responsibility of the local trade unions, so that the problem has not been solved for a long time, and the vast number of worker brothers have been suffering from cruel feudal exploitation to this day, for which we should be responsible.
　　On August 24th, the Labor Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee convened all relevant parties to organize a working group to investigate Lianhuasi for the second time. With the help of cadres sent by the Northwest People's Supervisory Committee and the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Party Committee of the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau re-examined itself and decided that the sub-bureau would transfer a group of cadres to be responsible for solving the problem of contractors' exploitation of workers at the site. We also request the local Party and government organs to send personnel to assist, and continue to study and improve on the basis of the previously established "Production Pledges" in order to completely eradicate feudal exploitation. We are especially grateful for the criticism and help from all parties, which have enabled our mistakes to be corrected.

　　西安铁路分局接受本报批评
    再度检查莲花寺事件  西安铁路分局表示，已着手处理包商额外剥削工人的严重问题
    编者按：六月十四日本报发表西安铁路分局所辖莲花寺石场包商残酷剥削工人的消息后，该分局代理局长袁伯扬等，曾于六月二十三日致函本报，表示诚恳接受批评，并谓：“包商额外剥削工人的问题已初步纠正。”但在八月六日本报又接到某军炮兵团政治处及陕西省华县县工会联名来函，反映莲花寺石场包商额外剥削工人的行为仍未停止。本报于八月二十六日将该函发表，并指出西安铁路分局接受批评不够严肃，希望他们在此次整风运动中，进行严肃的检查。九月十三日，该分局致函本报，表示接受批评，并进一步作了检讨，决心纠正缺点。兹将来函摘录如下。          人民日报编辑同志：
    四月下旬，人民日报记者陈迹同志在莲花寺石场发现了包商额外剥削工人的严重问题。分局根据这一材料，立即派工作组前往深入调查。当时华县县工会已经派有专人在莲花寺组织工会，并已选出工人代表。我们协同工会，一面帮助工人向大组长及包商清算工资及伙食帐目，一面教育包商，使他们每立方石减少半斤面粉的“管理”费、“工具”费，增加为工人工资。我们并针对石场不良现象，制定“生产公约”十八条，规定包商不许进行额外剥削，保证工人应得的工资，同时建立了一些民主制度，并确定了工人的政治待遇。这些规定，于五月十七日由华县工会何主任在工人大会上正式宣布实行，获得工人的一致拥护。西安铁路分局副局长王志恒同志，郑州铁路局政治部宣传部长秦瀛同志，并对照顾工人不周的地方，当众表示歉意。会中并揭发了包商的残酷剥削事实，依据群众意见与确实证据，将个别罪恶严重的大组长送交政府法办。会后由包商负责人及工人代表、工会主任在公约上共同签字盖章，并决定由工会负责监督执行。莲花寺问题至此告一段落。我们在致人民日报的检讨文中说“已获初步解决”，就是根据这种情况写的。
    五月二十日工作组回局以后，华县驻场工会无形撤销，由于无人监督，“生产公约”未能实现。五月二十五日，分局虽然又派王宝全同志到莲花寺成立联合办公室，但分局给予他的主要任务是解决生产与运输关系的问题（当时生产与运输配合不够，片石不能照计划运出，影响了防洪任务），其次才是处理包商剥削工人问题。联合办公室成立后，至八月底，虽曾组织部分工人，民主选出组长，自己管理伙食及工资。并清算了荣记大组长苗德时，李强、赵荣光等的贪污剥削案，追出面粉一万九千余斤。又由路局派去医生一人、护士二人，为工人医治疾病。并在解决工人与包商无数次的争执中，合理地保护了一部分工人的利益。但是这还只解决了部分工人的部分问题，并未把工人真正组织起来，包商亦未认真履行“生产公约”，因此工人遭受封建剥削的情况，基本上仍未改变。
    莲花寺石场问题告一段落后，亦曾在其他石场发现同样事件。西安铁路分局领导上感到包商制度的弊害太多，几条“公约”不能解决全部问题。因此一面请求西北军政委员会劳动部帮助寻求适当解决办法，一面派人到豫北老解放区组织石工，准备逐渐取消包商。终因领导上还未明确认识到问题的严重性，以致未能用严肃的态度，积极负责的精神来对待这一问题；而且不正确的认为路局与包商主要是交易关系，组织工会、反对包商的封建剥削，应由地方工会多负责任，这样就使得问题长久没得到解决，使广大工人兄弟，至今受着残酷的封建剥削，这是我们应该负责的。
    八月二十四日，西北军政委员会劳动部召集有关各方，组织工作组，二次赴莲花寺调查。在西北人民监察委员会及中共中央西北局所派出的干部的帮助下，西安铁路分局党委重新作了检讨，并决定由分局抽调一部分干部，驻场负责解决包商剥削工人问题。另请地方党政机关派员协助，仍以前订之“生产公约”为基础，再继续研究改进，以达到彻底根除封建剥削的目的。我们特别感激各方面的批评与帮助，使我们的错误，得到了纠正。    郑州铁路管理局西安分局
