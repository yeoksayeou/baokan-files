Most Leading Organs in Northeast China
    Conduct In-Depth Inspections at the Grassroots Level

    [Our Newspaper] To conduct in-depth inspections at the grassroots level is an important method adopted by many organs in Northeast China during the rectification movement. There are roughly three situations in which this method is used: one is a preliminary inspection to prepare for the rectification movement; another is to immediately go down to inspect in conjunction with current work after grasping the main problems; and the third is after the initial conclusion of the rectification movement in the leading organs, both to help the lower levels carry out rectification and consolidate the achievements of the previous stage, and to further deepen the rectification of the leading organs and explore more concrete ways to improve work.

    The first situation, for example, the Northeast Bureau, in order to convene a commercial conference, formed a working group with the Ministry of Trade and went to companies and stores to conduct investigations. It was discovered that in the leadership of commercial work in Northeast China, there were serious shortcomings such as simply emphasizing the recovery of currency and neglecting the normal circulation of commodities; trade plans lacking accuracy and completeness; improper control of price policies; and a supply system ideology lacking economic accounting. This provided very important materials for the commercial conference.

    The second situation: for example, after the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry initially identified the main shortcomings in water conservancy, the promotion of new farm tools, and other work, it immediately went down to inspect the upcoming flood control and the manufacture of new farm tools for the autumn harvest. As a result, it was found that there was serious bureaucracy in the leadership of the Water Conservancy Bureau, and the engineering plans lacked on-the-spot surveys and inspections. The large-scale Raoyang River fundamental treatment project was described in the Water Conservancy Bureau's written report as "basically completed," but in reality, only one of the six sluice gates had been repaired, and a section of the levee was one meter lower than the standard, posing a risk of overflowing even with a slightly larger water flow. Thousands of corn threshers manufactured by the Changchun factory were all substandard and could only be used for one or two hours before breaking down. In response to these serious problems discovered during the inspection, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry immediately formulated practical improvement measures. It stipulated that in the future, all levels of water conservancy departments must personally conduct on-site inspections of completed projects; new farm tools should not be manufactured and promoted on a large scale without testing to prevent similar shortcomings from occurring again.

    For example, after the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee Commercial Bureau reviewed the lack of economic accounting in commercial work, it conducted in-depth inspections of its department stores and shops and found that the quantity of commodities overstocked in the department store warehouses was very large and had been there for a long time. Among them, a batch of cigarette tin foil worth 5.2 billion yuan was purchased shortly after entering Shenyang in 1948 and had been overstocked for at least 20 months. This inspection deepened the leadership's understanding of the problem of lacking economic accounting thinking; at the same time, the causes of commodity overstocking were investigated during the inspection, and there was a practical basis for discussing improvement measures.

    The third situation is more common. After the initial conclusion of the rectification movement in the Northeast and provincial and municipal leading organs, most organs have transferred cadres to help with the rectification and further seek concrete ways to improve work. For example, after the Industrial Conference, the Northeast Bureau, together with the Ministry of Industry, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and other departments, formed a working group to help factories and mines implement the spirit of the Industrial Conference and create concrete experiences in improving management. The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions also sent special personnel to investigate and study the concrete experiences of uniting technical personnel and staff, and how grassroots trade unions carry out their work, so as to help lower-level trade unions gradually turn the spirit of uniting the entire working class and orienting trade union work towards production into practical action. However, this step has just begun, and the various departments have not been down there for long, so there are not many significant results yet.

            Pay attention to three issues when going down to inspect work

    According to the experience of various departments, the following three issues must be paid attention to when going down to inspect work: First, leading cadres must personally go down to inspect. The success of the inspection work of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry was due to the personal involvement of the minister and department heads. Second, the thinking must be clear, and the main problems and directions for improvement in the work must be clarified before going down with a clear understanding. In the past, some cadres of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions did not have a sufficient understanding of the basic shortcomings of trade union work not being oriented towards production, and when they went down to inspect work, they often only complained that the Party and the administration did not support or pay attention to trade union work. Now that the historical environment, basic tasks, and the correct relationship between the Party and the administration in Northeast trade union work have been clarified, the inspection work has shifted to focusing on understanding the shortcomings of trade union work itself and actively seeking the correct direction of improvement measures. After the Ministry of Public Security analyzed the main shortcomings and formulated improvement measures, it transferred a large number of cadres to go down to inspect work, and everyone felt that they had "weapons" and confidence. Third, going down to inspect work should be combined with studying documents and researching policies. For example, the Policy Research Office of the Northeast Bureau paid attention to combining the situations discovered during the inspection with relevant theoretical documents for discussion and research, which is one of the reasons why the Research Office's discovery and analysis of problems was relatively deep and the investigation work was relatively successful.

    Secondly, in order to make the materials obtained from the inspection play a role and prevent the one-sidedness of the inspection, it must also be combined with methods such as democratic inspection within the organs, transferring lower-level leading cadres to come up for meetings and inspections, and holding professional conferences for inspections.

    According to the experience of Northeast China, it is very necessary to conduct in-depth inspections at the grassroots level during the rectification movement. Because: First, there were many shortcomings in the work of Northeast China in the past, and one of the main reasons was that the understanding and analysis of the actual situation was not enough. Therefore, this rectification movement must first clarify the true situation and problems below. Second, when the rectification needs to go deeper, specific measures for improving work must be proposed. In order to make these measures conform to the specific situation below, it is necessary to go down to inspect work and summarize the experiences of the masses for promotion. Third, the rectification of Northeast and provincial and municipal levels has initially ended, and the basic situation of the rectification below is that they are not good at combining the policies with their own specific situations. Therefore, in order to implement the achievements of the previous stage of the rectification movement, it is necessary to go down to inspect work and help with the rectification below.

    Now, many departments have experienced the importance and role of going down to inspect work, and have begun to establish a regular inspection work system and are researching and improving inspection methods. For example, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry stipulates that leading cadres at all levels must personally go down to inspect work regularly. The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions and the General Post and Telecommunications Bureau have established or improved inspection agencies and transferred inspection cadres. Many departments have decided that in the future, they will often conduct systematic inspections of work from beginning to end with a purpose and focus, and analyze and research them in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, raising them to the level of policies and principles, so as to fundamentally correct shortcomings and improve work.

### 东北多数领导机关  深入基层检查工作

　　东北多数领导机关
    深入基层检查工作
    【本报讯】深入基层检查工作，是东北许多机关整风中采用的一项重要方法。采用这种方法的大体上有三种情况：一种是为整风做准备工作的事先检查；一种是抓住主要问题之后，马上就结合当前工作下去检查；再一种是在领导机关整风初步结束以后，一方面下去帮助下级整风，巩固前一阶段的整风成果，一方面使领导机关的整风更深入一步，并摸索更具体的改进工作办法。
    第一种情况，例如东北局为了召开商业会议，曾协同贸易部组成工作组，深入到公司、商店进行调查，发现了东北商业工作的领导上存在着单纯强调回笼，忽视正常的商品流转；贸易计划缺乏准确性及完整性，价格政策掌握失当，缺乏经济核算的供给制思想等严重缺点，给商业会议提供了很重要的材料。
    第二种情况：如农林部在初步检查出水利、推广新农具等工作中的主要缺点之后，马上下去检查即要开始的防汛和制造秋收新农具等工作。结果发现水利局领导上存在严重的官僚主义作风，工程计划缺乏实地勘察和检查。规模宏大的绕阳河治本工程，水利局书面报告中说已经“基本完成”，实际上六个闸门只修好一个，有一段河堤比标准低一公尺，水势稍大便有漫堤危险。长春工厂制造的几千台苞米脱粒机全部不合规格，只能使用一二小时就坏了。针对检查出来的这些严重问题，农林部随即拟定了切合实际的改进办法。规定以后各级水利部门检查竣工，一定要亲到现场实际勘察；制作新农具时不经试验不许大量制造推广，以防止今后再发生类似的缺点。
    再如沈阳市委商业局检讨出商业工作上缺乏经济核算思想后，深入检查了所属百货公司及商店，发现百货公司仓库中商品积压数量很大，时间很久。其中一项价值五十二亿元的包烟锡纸，是在一九四八年进入沈阳后不久买进的，至少已积压二十个月。这次检查使领导上对缺乏经济核算思想的问题，认识更加深刻；同时在检查中调查了商品积压的原因，研讨改进办法时也有了切实的依据。
    第三种情况比较多，东北及省市级领导机关的整风初步结束后，大部机关都已调派干部下去帮助整风和进一步寻求具体的改进工作办法。如工业会议之后，东北局协同工业部、总工会等部门组成工作组，下去帮助厂矿贯彻工业会议的精神，创造改进经营管理的具体经验。东北总工会亦派专人下去调查研究团结技术人员与职员和基层工会如何进行工作的具体经验，以便帮助下级工会把团结全体工人阶级和工会工作面向生产的精神逐渐变为实际行动。但是这一步工作方才开始，各部门下去都不久，所以显著的成效还不多。
            下去检查工作注意三个问题
    根据各部门的体验，下去检查工作时，必须注意以下三个问题：一、领导干部亲自下去检查。农林部的检查工作所以成功，就是因为部长和处长亲自下去的结果。第二，要思想明确，把工作中的主要问题和改进方向弄清楚之后，心里有了底再下去。过去东北总工会有些干部思想上对工会工作没有面向生产的基本缺点认识不足，下去检查工作时，往往只埋怨党和行政不支持不重视工会工作。现在当弄清楚了东北工会工作的历史环境、基本任务、和党与行政的正确关系之后，检查工作便转向了着重了解工会工作本身的缺点和积极寻取改进办法的正确方向。公安部在把主要缺点进行了分析，订出了改进办法之后，抽调了大批干部下去检查工作，大家都感到有了“武器”和信心。第三，下去检查工作要与学习文件、研究方针政策结合起来。如东北局政策研究室注意把下去检查出的情况和有关的理论文件结合起来讨论研究，这是研究室发现与分析问题比较深刻、调查工作比较成功的原因之一。
    其次，要使下去检查所得的材料发挥作用，并防止检查的偏面性，还必须与机关内部的民主检查、调下级领导干部上来开会检查，以及召开专业会议进行检查等方式结合起来。
    根据东北的经验，整风中深入基层检查工作是很必要的。因为：一、东北过去工作中有很多缺点，主要原因之一就是对实际情况的了解与分析不够。因此这次整风首先必须弄清下面的真实情况和问题。二、在整风需要深入一步的时候，要提出具体的改进工作办法。为了使这些办法切合下面具体情况，就必须下去检查工作，必须总结群众中的经验来加以推广。三、东北及省市级的整风已初步结束，下面整风的基本情况是不善于把方针政策与自己具体情况结合起来。因此要贯彻前一阶段的整风成果，就必须下去检查工作，帮助下面整风。
    现在，不少部门体验到下去检查工作的重要性和作用，已开始建立经常的检查工作制度，并且研究改进了检查的方法。如农林部规定了各级领导干部必须定期亲自下去检查工作。东北总工会和邮电总局都建立或健全了检查机构，调配了检查干部。许多部门都决定今后要经常地有目的有重点地从头到底系统地检查工作，并以批评与自我批评的精神，提到政策原则上来分析研究，以便从根本上纠正缺点，改进工作。（聂眉初）
