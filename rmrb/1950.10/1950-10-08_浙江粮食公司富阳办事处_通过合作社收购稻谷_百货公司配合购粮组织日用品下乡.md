    Department Stores Cooperating with Grain Purchase by Organizing the Supply of Daily Necessities to the Countryside
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to strengthen the effort to purchase rice, the Fuyang Office of Zhejiang Grain Company has successively signed purchasing contracts with the Supply and Marketing Cooperatives of Tonglu and Xindeng counties. Through the county general cooperatives, purchasing relationships have been established with the cooperatives in Dayuan, Changkou, Qingyun, Taiping and other districts, and rice purchasing has now begun in full swing. Approximately 70,000 jin are purchased daily.
    The Fuyang Office of China Department Store Company is also cooperating with the purchase, organizing the supply of industrial products to the countryside for farmers. After selling their grain, farmers can buy the necessary industrial goods they need. The sales volume of the department store company is increasing daily. In early August, sales of cotton cloth were 3.79 million yuan; in mid-September, they increased to more than 10.48 million yuan, an increase of more than one and a half times. Sales of daily necessities have increased more than one-fold compared to August.

    通过合作社收购稻谷
    百货公司配合购粮组织日用品下乡
    【本报讯】浙江粮食公司富阳办事处为了加强收购稻谷的力量，先后和桐庐、新登两县供销总社订定代购合约，并通过县总社与大源、场口、青云、太平等区合作社建立代购关系，现已全面开始收稻。每日约收七万余斤。
    中国百货公司富阳办事处亦配合收购，组织工业品下乡供应农民。农民卖了粮食，就去买自所已需要的工业必需品。百货公司销货数量日有增加。八月上旬销棉布三百七十九万元，九月中旬增至一千零四十八万余元，增加一倍半以上。日用百货均比八月份销货增多一倍以上。
