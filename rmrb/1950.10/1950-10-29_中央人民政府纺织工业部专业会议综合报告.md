　　Comprehensive Report on the Professional Conference of the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government
　　--Report by Vice Minister Qian Zhiguang at the 51st Administrative Council Meeting of the Government Administration Council on September 22, 1950
　　The Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government, in accordance with Chairman Mao's directive to "rationally adjust industry and commerce" and the provisions of Articles 26 and 30 of the Common Program, convened five national professional conferences from March to August: the Textile Conference, the Wool and Flax Conference, the Machinery and Materials Conference, the Reproduction and Dyeing Conference, and the Cotton Inspection Conference. The representatives attending these five conferences, including representatives from the public, private, labor, and management sectors of the Northeast, North China, East China, Central South, Southwest, and Northwest administrative regions, totaled 530 people. Except for the Textile Conference, private representatives accounted for 48 percent of the total. A comprehensive report on the situation of the above conferences is presented below:
　　(1) General Situation
　　The five conferences made a preliminary understanding of the general situation of the main equipment, operation, etc. of the national textile industry. Except for flax spinning, each industry has its common characteristics.
　　First, most of the factories are located in coastal areas, especially concentrated in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Tianjin.
　　Second, for decades, most of the raw materials have been supplied by foreign countries. Except for 1936, when cotton was barely self-sufficient, it has relied on imports every year, ranking third among imported goods; since the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, cotton imports have jumped to first place. Except for a few factories in the Northwest and Southwest, most of the wool still relies on foreign wool. Most of them are semi-finished wool tops. The largest part of the chemicals required for printing and dyeing must be imported from abroad.
　　Third, equipment is disjointed: there are more spindles than looms, more post-spinning than pre-spinning, and wool weaving factories themselves lack pre-spinning equipment and can only use foreign wool tops to make yarn and woolen cloth. The existing equipment of the printing and dyeing industry has a maximum production capacity that exceeds the amount of cloth available for printing and dyeing nationwide by more than three times.
　　Fourth, production and sales are disjointed: there is more high-count yarn than coarse-count yarn, and the products are not suitable for mass needs.
　　Fifth, most of the organizations are bloated, with huge expenses and high costs.
　　The above characteristics show that China's textile industry is indeed an industry with deep semi-colonial and semi-feudal characteristics. Changing this nature to suit the needs of the new democratic economy has become the focus of our adjustment of industry and commerce.
　　(2) Production Policy and Plan
　　After understanding the situation, each conference immediately determined the production policy and production plan.
　　(1) Production Policy: Cotton Textile Industry—Restore and improve production and reorganize enterprises on the existing foundation.
　　Other textile industries also take this as a basis and make appropriate changes according to their specific actual conditions. In the wool textile industry, the policy is to maintain as much as possible and improve industrial wool and popularize finished products. In the reproduction and dyeing industry, the policy is to improve business methods. The jute bag industry can be appropriately developed because of the large domestic demand for jute bags and no problem with raw materials.
　　(2) Production Plan: Based on the above policies, and in accordance with the raw material supply, local equipment and production capacity, and actual operating conditions in 1950, the 1950 production plan for national public and private textile factories was determined.
　　(3) Public-Private Relations and Others
　　In accordance with the principle of taking into account both public and private interests, the following issues were resolved:
　　(1) Overcoming difficulties in production:
　　(A) Raw material supply: According to the above plan, the central government has vigorously purchased domestic cotton to maintain production and prohibited the export of domestic wool to supply the needs of domestic industry, only exporting the surplus. In addition, other auxiliary measures have been taken to solve the source of raw materials.
　　At the same time, public and private factories are encouraged to jointly organize the joint purchase of cotton, flax, and wool, and it has been decided to increase the number of wool washing plants, combing plants, and packaging plants in wool-producing areas. If private manufacturers are also willing to build additional equipment in these areas, they will be encouraged. Both parties are willing to adopt joint ventures.
　　(B) Number of operating days: Public and private are treated equally. The hemp, wool, and printing and dyeing industries, regardless of each other, operate according to plan.
　　(C) Processing orders: In order to enable factories to smoothly implement plans and maintain production, and to process orders for private factories, we will help solve various difficulties such as raw materials, markets, and funds.
　　(D) Adjusting labor costs: In order to take care of the actual situation of private factories, labor costs are appropriately increased according to the average operating standards in various regions. Taking 20-count yarn as an example, in Shanghai, East China, it was increased from 205 units to 224 units, and in the Southwest it was 260 units, so that private factories can gradually obtain profits from break-even and self-sufficiency.
　　(2) Improve business management
　　(A) Formulate draft business standards: In the Full Textile Conference, Wool and Linen Reproduction and Dyeing Conference, draft business standards for yarn, cloth, wool textiles, jute bag factories, and printing and dyeing, knitting, and underwear were formulated, stipulating the fixed quality, quantity, material, and staffing of each industry. It pointed out the future direction of operation and provided a preliminary basis for factories to practice thrift and reduce expenses, change past operating methods, correct shoddy manufacturing, and correctly grasp costs. In the future, whether public or private factories, they must strictly inspect according to business standards to ensure the use value of finished products and promote the improvement and improvement of technical level.
　　There have been some new reforms in previous operating standards. Such as reducing the sizing rate of yarn and cloth, unifying cotton blending, unifying specifications, simplifying packaging, canceling green lines on sacks, stipulating the use of materials, and unifying cost accounting subjects.
　　With operating standards, there are norms to follow. East China has used this to assist private factories in improving their work, and significant results have been achieved.
　　(B) Determine the water content, impurities, and grade differences of cotton: The Cotton Inspection Conference re-determined the moisture content of cotton based on past experience and the results of planned experiments in various regions over the past six months. The national range is 10%, and the maximum should not exceed 12%; however, due to climatic conditions in the Yangtze River Basin and its southern regions, 11% is the standard for business processing, and the maximum should not exceed 13%. Regarding the price differences between various types and lengths of cotton, a more reasonable standard was re-established, taking into account the interests of agriculture, trade, and industry.
　　(C) Stipulate the "four unifications" and "two fixations" of machinery and materials: A scientific system was established for the supply and management of machinery and materials, which are the most complicated in the textile industry. The National Machinery and Materials Conference brought together 59 representatives and experts from public and private factories across the country. The conference lasted for a month and formulated the unified classification, unified numbering, unified name, and unified unit of 44 major categories and more than 7,800 types of textile materials. Based on advanced figures, quotas for consumption were stipulated; quality standards were stipulated based on China's production level. To maintain a certain economic value of various finished products and lay the foundation for economic accounting.
　　(D) Promote joint operations: Promote joint operations of small-scale, semi-handicraft, incomplete equipment, and poor technology factories such as printing, dyeing and reproduction to overcome difficulties. The reproduction industry in Shanghai, Northeast and other places has begun this work.
　　(3) Others:
　　In addition, issues such as loans, markets, taxes, and trade associations were appropriately resolved at the meeting.
　　In order to help public and private enterprises tide over temporary sluggish sales of seasonal finished products, they can apply for mortgage loans. The areas for discounting finished products during transportation and sales have been expanded.
　　In order to enable the textile administrative department to maintain regular contact with factories in various regions, assist in strengthening and improving the organization of local trade associations. Trade associations should play an organizational and guiding role for factories, reflect the situation to the government, and facilitate problem-solving through vertical communication between factories and trade associations, and between trade associations and the textile administrative department.
　　To sum up, the five professional conferences held by the Ministry of Textile Industry in the past six months: understood the situation, adjusted public-private relations, clarified the production policy, formulated the production plan, and initially began to improve production and improve management.

　　中央人民政府纺织工业部专业会议综合报告
    ——钱之光副部长在一九五○年九月二十二日政务院第五十一次政务会议上的报告
    中央人民政府纺织工业部遵照毛主席“合理调整工商业”的指示，共同纲领二十六条及三十条的规定，于三月至八月间先后召开了全国性专业会议五次，计纺织会议、毛麻会议、机物料会议、复制印染会议及棉花检验会议。出席这五次会议的代表，包括东北、华北、华东、中南、西南、西北各大行政区的公私劳资四个方面的代表共计五三○人，除纺织会议外，私营代表占总数百分之四十八。兹将以上会议的情况综合报告于后：
    （一）一般情况
    五次会议对于全国纺织工业的主要设备、运转等一般情况作了初步的了解。除麻纺织外，各业都有其共同特点。
    第一  工厂大都设于沿海地区，特别集中于上海、青岛、天津三地。
    第二  数十年来原料大部仰给国外，棉花除一九三六年曾差堪自给外，历年都赖进口，并占进口货的第三位；自抗日战争结束后，棉花进口一跃而居第一位。羊毛除西北、西南少数厂外，绝大部分仍赖外毛。其中大部分是半制品的毛条。印染所需的化学品，最大部分须从国外输入。
    第三  设备脱节：纺锭多于织机，后纺多于前纺，毛织厂本身缺乏前纺设备，只能利用国外毛条制成绒线和呢绒。印染业现有设备最高生产能力超过全国可供印染的布匹多出三倍。
    第四  产销脱节：高支纱多于粗支纱，产品不适合于大众需要。
    第五  机构大都臃肿，开支浩繁，成本昂贵。
    以上特点，表明我国纺织工业确是具有深重的半殖民地性半封建性的工业。改变这种性质，使其适合于新民主主义经济的需要，乃成为我们调整工商业的重点。
    （二）生产方针和计划
    在了解情况之后，历次会议即行确定生产方针与生产计划。
    （１）生产方针：棉纺织业——在现有基础上，恢复与改进生产，改组企业。
    其他纺织工业亦以此为根据，按各别实际情况，适当改变。在毛纺织业方面，采取尽可能维持，以改进工业用呢与成品大众化为方针。在复制印染业方面，以改善经营方式为方针。麻袋工业，因国内麻袋需要量多，原料不成问题，可作适当发展。
    （２）生产计划：根据以上方针，并按照一九五○年原料供应，各地设备及生产能力，实际开工状况，确定了全国公私营纺织厂一九五○年生产计划。
    （三）公私关系及其他
    根据公私兼顾原则，解决如下问题：
    （１）克服生产中的困难：
    （甲）原料供应：按照以上计划，中央已以大力收购国棉维持生产，并禁止国毛出口，以供应国内工业的需要，只将剩余部分输出。此外并采取其他辅助办法解决原料来源。
    同时鼓励公私营厂协同组织联购棉、麻、毛，并决定在产毛区增设洗毛厂、梳毛厂、打包厂。如私营厂商亦愿在该地区增建设备，予以鼓励。双方自愿，可采取合营。
    （乙）开工日数：公私一视同仁。麻、毛及印染等业无分彼此，一律按计划开工。
    （丙）加工定货：为使各厂能顺利执行计划，维持生产，并对私营厂进行加工定货，帮助解决原料、市场、资金等各种困难。
    （丁）调整工缴：为照顾私营厂实际情况，按各地中等经营标准，适当提高工缴。以二十支纱为例，华东之上海，由二○五单位提高至二二四单位，西南为二六○单位，使私营厂可逐步由保本自给而获利润。
    （２）改进经营管理
    （甲）制定经营标准草案：在全纺会议毛麻复制印染会议中，制定了纱、布、毛纺织、麻袋厂及印染、针织、内衣等各项经营标准草案，规定了各业的定质、定量、定料、定员，指出今后的经营方向，为各厂厉行精简节约，改变过去的经营方式，改正粗制滥造，正确掌握成本的初步基础。今后无论公私营厂，都须根据经营标准，严格检验，借以保证成品的使用价值，促进技术水平的改进和提高。
    历次的经营标准，都有一些新的改革。如减低纱布含浆率、统一混棉、统一规格、简化包装、取消麻袋绿线、规定用料、统一成本计算科目等。
    有经营标准，就有规范可寻。华东方面借此协助私营厂改进工作，已收到显著的效果。
    （乙）确定棉花掺水含杂及等级差价：棉花检验会议根据以往经验及半年来各地有计划试验的结果，重订棉花水分。在全国范围内为百分之十，最高不得超过百分之十二；但长江流域及其以南地区由于气候关系在业务处理上以百分之十一为标准，最高不得超过百分之十三。杂质分甲乙两类：甲类杂质在棉花等级内计算，不从量计算；乙类杂质全国均以百分之一为标准，最多不得超过百分之三。关于各种类别棉花及长度品级差价，照顾农业、贸易、工业三方面的利益，经重新订定更合理的标准。
    （丙）规定机物料的“四统”“二定”：为纺织工业最繁杂的机物料的供应、管理，建立了科学的制度。全国机物料会议，曾集合全国公私营厂代表及专家五十九人，会议长达一月，订出四十四大类，七千八百余种纺织材料的统一分类、统一编号、统一名称、统一单位的工作，并根据先进数字规定了消耗定额；根据我国生产水平，规定了品质标准。以保持各种成品的一定经济价值和奠定经济核算的基础。
    （丁）推动联营：对印染复制等小型的、半手工业式的、设备不全的、技术较差的工厂，促其联营，克服困难。上海、东北等地的复制业，已开始进行此一工作。
    （３）其他：
    此外，在会议中适当解决了贷款、市场、税收、同业公会等问题。
    为了帮助公私企业因季节性成品一时滞销，可以抵押贷款。在运销过程中的成品，已扩大押汇地区。
    为了使纺织行政部门能与各地工厂取得经常联系，协助其加强与健全各地同业公会的组织。同业公会对工厂应起组织与辅导的作用，对政府反映情况，使工厂与同业公会，同业公会与纺织行政部门，上下联系便于解决问题。
    纺织工业部六个月来所召开的五次专业会议，综合起来说：了解了情况，调整了公私关系，明确了生产方针，制定了生产计划，并初步开始了改进生产，改进管理的工作。    【新华社】
