　　We will always remember Auntie Yin!
　　To the Editor:
　　We were originally soldiers of the 7th Company of the × Regiment of the People's Liberation Army × Division. We left our original garrison, Changxindian, during this unit reorganization. In Changxindian, at 10 Deshan Lane, there is an Auntie Yin, who is already over fifty years old. She treated us even more kindly than our own mothers, taking care of us meticulously. Last October, the unit went to the Zhangjiakou area for plague prevention, and it was already November when we returned to Changxindian. We returned in the middle of the night, and Auntie Yin immediately brought her oil lamp to the platoon, and boiled water and found bed boards, staying busy until dawn. Once, the eighth squad leader and Wang Zhirong were both sick. Auntie Yin came to comfort them two or three times a day, buying medicine and candy for them, decocting medicine, and often cooking and boiling water for the patients. Usually, when the comrades got up for drills every morning, she always boiled a pot of water and brought it to the platoon. If our clothes or socks were torn, she would mend them for us as soon as she saw them. No matter how we declined, it was no use. She said, "The army and the people are one family. The liberation and emancipation of the people rely on the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. I can't do anything else, but I can still help you with these odd jobs." This time we left this kind and dear mother, and we will hold our guns tightly and resolutely be good soldiers of the people to express our gratitude to the people.

　　我们永远记着尹大娘！编辑同志：
    我们原是人民解放军×师×团七连的战士，在这次部队合编时离开了原驻地长辛店。在长辛店德善里十号有一位姓尹的大娘，已经五十多岁了。她对待我们真是比我们自己的母亲还亲，无微不至地来照顾我们。去年十月，部队到张家口一带防鼠疫，回长辛店时已十一月了。我们在半夜回来，尹大娘马上把自己的油灯送到班里来，并且烧开水、找铺板，一直忙到天亮。有一次，八班长与王芝荣两人病了，尹大娘每天两三次来安慰他们，代他们买药、买糖、煎药，并经常给病人做饭、烧水。平时同志们每天早晨起来出操，她总是烧一壶开水送到班里去。我们的衣服或袜子破了，她一看见就要给我们补。我们怎样辞谢也不行。她说：“军民是一家，老百姓的解放和翻身依靠着共产党与人民解放军。我别的不能做，这些零活我还会帮助你们的。”我们这次离开了这位慈善的亲爱的母亲，我们要握紧枪杆，坚决作一个人民的好战士，来表示对人民的感谢。
