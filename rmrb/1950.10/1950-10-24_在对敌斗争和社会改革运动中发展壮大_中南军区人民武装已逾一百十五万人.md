Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 23rd. In the ten months since the Central and Southern Military Region vigorously promoted the construction of the people's armed forces, the militia in the entire region has grown to over 1,157,690 people. They have been developed and organized in the struggle against the enemy and social reform movements. The old revolutionary base areas of Kaocheng and Suixian in Henan, Huangmei and Chao汕 (Shantou) in Guangdong, and Hainan Island organized militias eight years ago. They have undergone rigorous training during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and the land reform movement. The militias in the vast semi-old and new areas have also been tested in the suppression of bandits, opposition to local bullies, and the struggle for rent reduction.

In addition to doing their utmost to support the front lines during the War of Liberation, the militias in the old areas also created many heroic achievements in the struggle against the enemy. More than 500 militiamen in the first and fourth districts of Suixian defended the south bank of the Huiji River during the War of Liberation. They repelled ten large and small attacks by the Kuomintang bandit troops in two months, safeguarding the land reform movement that was underway in the two districts at the time. In another battle, more than 90 militiamen in the first district stalled the advance of a Kuomintang army brigade, completing the task of coordinating with the People's Liberation Army to completely annihilate the 6th Security Regiment of the bandit army. After the liberation of the entire Central and Southern region, the militias cooperated with the People's Liberation Army in bandit suppression operations and achieved great victories. According to incomplete statistics from the four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Guangxi, the militia participated in a total of 3,194 bandit suppression operations, eliminating 8,969 bandits. The Yiyang militia mobilized the masses in a large-scale search of the mountains with 4,000 people to capture the bandit leader who had fled into the steep mountain forests. Seven militiamen in a village in Guiping County fought against more than 200 bandits, killing seven bandits, until the PLA bandit suppression troops arrived and cooperated with the main force to annihilate more than 60 bandits. In addition, the militias in various places launched activities such as guarding warehouses, protecting roads, and protecting harvests. Militiamen along the railway lines in Henan patrolled and guarded day and night to ensure the safety of trains. During this year's summer harvest, the militias in the Luoyang sub-district carried out village-to-village joint defense, patrolling and guarding, protecting the wheat harvest, making the wheat harvest order in the area particularly good.

People's governments at all levels in the Central and Southern region attach importance to the development and organization of the people's armed forces. At the beginning of this year, the Military and Political Committee put forward the policy of building the militia in the resolution of "Work Tasks in 1950". By August, the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Central and Southern Military Region of the People's Liberation Army successively issued two instructions on strengthening militia construction and strengthening cadre education for people's armed work. The military sub-districts of the Henan Military Region held militia review meetings on "August 1st" Army Day and gave awards to militia models. Local people's governments also convened militia cadre meetings and militia representative meetings to publicize the model deeds of the people's armed forces in order to improve the military and political qualities of the militia and militia cadres.

　　在对敌斗争和社会改革运动中发展壮大
    中南军区人民武装已逾一百十五万人
    【新华社汉口二十三日电】中南军区大力建设人民武装以来的十个月中，全区民兵已发展到一百十五万七千六百九十余人。他们是在对敌斗争和社会改革运动中发展和组织起来的。河南考城、睢县和广东黄梅、潮汕及海南岛等老区在八年前组织起来的民兵，经受了抗日战争、解放战争和土地改革运动的坚强锻炼，而广大半老区和新区的民兵，也经过了剿匪、反恶霸和减租斗争的考验。
    老区民兵在解放战争中除了尽力支援前线外，并在对敌斗争中创立了许多英雄的业迹。睢县第一、第四两区五百余民兵曾在解放战争中坚守惠济河南岸，两个月内连续击退国民党匪军大小十次的进攻，保卫了两区当时展开的土地改革运动。在另一次战斗中，第一区九十多个民兵曾滞阻国民党军一个旅的前进，完成了配合人民解放军全歼匪军保安第六团的任务。中南全境解放后，民兵们配合人民解放军进行剿匪作战，取得了巨大的胜利。据河南、湖北、湖南、广西四个省的不完全统计：民兵共参加剿匪作战三千一百九十四次，歼匪八千九百六十九人。宜阳民兵为捕捉逃匿在峻山丛林中的匪首，曾发动群众进行了四千人的大搜山。桂平县某村七个民兵，与二百多个土匪对战，击毙土匪七名，直到解放军剿匪部队赶到，又配合主力歼匪六十多名。此外，各地民兵展开了护仓、护路、护收等项活动。河南沿铁路线民兵，曾日夜巡逻看守，保证了行车的安全。洛阳分区民兵在今年夏收中进行村村联防，巡视放哨，保护麦收，使该区麦收秩序特别良好。
    中南区各级人民政府重视发展和组织人民武装工作。本年初军政委员会在“一九五○年工作任务”的决议中提出建设民兵的方针，到八月间，中共中央中南局和人民解放军中南军区曾相继发出了关于加强民兵建设及加强人民武装工作干部教育的两项指示。河南军区各军分区曾于“八一”建军节分别举行民兵检阅大会，并给民兵模范庆功发奖。各地人民政府还召开了民兵干部会议、民兵代表会议，宣扬人民武装的模范事迹，以提高民兵和民兵干部的军事、政治素质。
