Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The cultural circles of the capital held a commemorative meeting yesterday to mark the 14th anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death. The commemorative meeting was hosted by the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Workers. More than 900 people attended the meeting, including literary and art workers from the capital and various places in Beijing, representatives of literary and art workers of various ethnic groups, workers, combat heroes, students, heads of relevant agencies, cultural counselors of foreign embassies, and foreign journalists.

The commemorative meeting was opened by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles. He said: Mr. Lu Xun, the great fighter of Chinese revolutionary culture, is worthy of our eternal commemoration. He called on everyone to learn from Lu Xun's clear-cut love and hatred, his strong love for the motherland and the people, and his strong hatred for imperialism, feudalism, and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang.

Those who spoke at the commemorative meeting included Hu Qiaomu, Secretary-General of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council, Lao She, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Cui Ying, Cultural Counselor of the Korean Embassy in China, Rogov, Director of the TASS Branch in China, Zhou Jianren, Deputy Director of the Central People's Government Publishing Administration, writer Hu Feng, combat hero Zhang Ming, worker representative Zhang Shirong, and student representative Zheng Shijun.

In his speech, Hu Qiaomu pointed out: With the great victory of the people's revolution, our literary and art workers have achieved great victories in eliminating counter-revolutionary literature and art, developing revolutionary literature and art, promoting the popularization of literature and art, and cultivating young literary and art workers. This is the victory of Lu Xun's cause. However, our work still has great shortcomings. We have the responsibility to earnestly learn from Mr. Lu Xun's working spirit, to learn from Lu Xun's close concern for politics, and to use our pens enthusiastically, sharply, and accurately to attack the enemies of the people at any time and anywhere. We should learn from Lu Xun's serious and earnest working attitude towards literary and artistic undertakings and his spirit of learning tirelessly and striving for progress. And for these reasons, we should improve the dissemination of Lu Xun's thoughts and art.

In his speech, Lao She recalled the situation when he was shamelessly persecuted by the reactionary Kuomintang government when he commemorated Mr. Lu Xun in Chongqing. He pointed out that today not only is Lu Xun respected, but every revolutionary literary and art worker is respected by the people. Literary and art workers must learn from Lu Xun's fighting spirit of loving the motherland and the people in order to repay the respect of the people.

In his speech, Cui Ying pointed out that Lu Xun's works have already had a significant impact on Korean revolutionary culture. He hoped that the literary and art workers of the two countries, China and North Korea, would unite better to oppose the common enemy, the American aggressors.

Rogov said: Lu Xun was a great friend of the Soviet people. In his literary career, he made great efforts to introduce Soviet literature and art to the Chinese people.

Hu Feng's speech focused on analyzing the spirit of patriotism and internationalism that filled Lu Xun's thought.

Zhang Ming vividly narrated how Lu Xun's works and Lu Xun's indomitable fighting spirit gave him the confidence to win in the most difficult battles.

After the speeches, the commemorative meeting screened the film "Xianglin's Wife," which was adapted from Lu Xun's posthumous work "Blessing" and based on the Yue opera "Xianglin's Wife."

Today, all newspapers in Beijing published special issues commemorating Lu Xun or published articles commemorating Lu Xun. Peking University and other schools will hold evening parties to commemorate Lu Xun tonight.
