Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, October 19th: New oil deposits have been discovered in Shaanxi. This is the preliminary result of an inspection conducted in June by over thirty geologists and petroleum experts dispatched by the Petroleum Administration Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Department. The inspection area covered 3,180 square kilometers, including over a dozen counties. The results of the survey and exploration confirmed and discovered over forty oil seepages and more than twenty oil-bearing geological structures of varying sizes, one of which covers an area as large as 80 square kilometers. In addition, the experts discovered many valuable geological and geographical data, providing favorable conditions for the complete exploration of oil geology in northern and central Shaanxi. The Petroleum Administration Bureau has now decided to select important geological structures to continue detailed exploration and drilling.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, October 11th: The Yumen Oil Mine in Gansu Province has seen a significant increase in production in the year since liberation. Currently, the output of various departments of the mine has increased by approximately 10 to 30 percent compared to before liberation. Comparing August of this year with January, crude oil production increased by 25 percent, and kerosene production increased by 114 percent. Comparing July with January, gasoline production increased by 7 percent. The efficiency of drilling operations has also improved, with drilling time reduced from 80 minutes to 60 minutes.

The mine's employees have created or improved 22 tools. Among them, the vacuum tube DC amplifier manufactured by young assistant engineer Wang Yuecai enables the mine's well logging work to be more accurate than using the original American-made electric logging instruments. In overcoming equipment difficulties, the mine's employees launched a campaign to collect waste materials, finding 73.5 tons of usable materials and more than 1,800 tools and equipment from the waste.

　　陕西石油矿藏有新发现
    甘肃玉门油矿产量增加
    【新华社西安十九日电】陕石油矿藏有新的发现。这是中央燃料工业部石油管理总局六月间派出三十多位地质学家和石油专家到当地考察的初步结果。这次考察区域达三千一百八十平方公里，包括十几个县份。考察勘测结果，证实和发现油苗四十余处、大小储油地质构造二十余个，其中一个储油地质构造面积大达八十平方公里。此外，专家们还发现了许多地质学上和地理学上的宝贵资料，给完全探察陕北、陕中石油地质提供了有利条件。现石油管理总局决定选择重要的地质构造，继续进行精密勘测和钻探工作。
    【新华社西安十一日电】甘肃省玉门油矿解放一年来，产量已有显著提高。目前，该矿各部门生产量较解放前提高约百分之十到百分之三十。如以今年八月份与一月份比较，原油产量提高百分之二十五、煤油产量提高百分之一百一十四。七月份与一月份比较，汽油产量提高了百分之七。钻井工程的效率也较前提高，下钻时间已由八十分钟减为六十分钟。
    全矿职工创造或改进的工具现已有二十二件。其中青年助理工程师王曰才制造的真空管直流放大器，使该矿测井工作较使用原来美制电测器更为精确。在克服器材困难上，该矿职工曾发起搜集废料运动，由废料中找出能用的材料达七十三吨半、工具器材一千八百余件。
