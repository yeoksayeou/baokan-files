(By Our Correspondent) After rectification and study, cadres in most counties and districts of Shaanxi and Gansu provinces have begun to change their thinking and work style, and have made considerable achievements in various tasks. First, the leadership in the counties has begun to overcome the phenomenon of more deployment than inspection. The Baoji Sub-district established a system of circuit inspections during the summer grain requisition. Leading cadres such as county heads, county party secretaries, and department and section chiefs went deep into the grassroots in an organized and planned manner to inspect the work, discover problems and deal with them in a timely manner to ensure the smooth progress of the work. For example, Wang Du, the head of Baoji County, found that cadres were bargaining with the masses during the evaluation of production in Xiping District during his circuit inspection in Xiping, Jinling, Shennong and other districts in early August, and immediately corrected it. As a result, the masses gained a deeper understanding of the People's Government and the Communist Party. They said, "Farmers remove the extra branches when they see them on the crops and trees. The Communist Party quickly gets rid of the shortcomings of the cadres!" Chenggu County in southern Shaanxi, Nanle, Yuangong, Chengguan and other districts, also strengthened the inspection of work, and convened two to three meetings of township cadres to inspect work in a month (Editor's note: Inspection work meetings are necessary, but too many will also affect the work below; and it is easy to become a formality. It is a bit too much for Nanle and other districts to convene two to three inspection meetings in a month. The methods of inspection work should be diverse, such as the circuit inspection of Baoji sub-district, and the key inspections of other regions, etc., are all very good inspection methods.).

Secondly, the work style of district and township cadres has also changed, and they have adopted the method of consulting with the masses on matters, so the work has achieved remarkable results. The drought resistance and seedling protection work in Chenggu County, after cadres at all levels actively consulted with the masses to find solutions, finally overcame the drought. In Nanle District alone, 10,320 laborers were mobilized in the drought resistance, 14 canals were dug through, and 172 wells were dug in ten days. Each district also organized patrol teams and formulated water release agreements, which greatly reduced water disputes. In the work of suppressing bandits, the masses were mobilized to launch a mass movement to eliminate bandits. In twenty days, seven habitual bandits were captured and twenty-three bandits were won over, severely打击the bandit activities in the area, and social order gradually stabilized. In the grain collection last year, the phenomenon of concealing land was quite common in various counties of Baoji Sub-district. This year, the method of mobilizing the masses to report themselves was adopted, and a large number of hidden land was found. In the four townships of Shigou District, Qianyang, only more than 34,000 mu of land were registered last year, but this year, more than 67,000 mu of land were registered, almost doubling the amount of last year.

Thirdly, county and district-level cadres in various places have begun to pay attention to the training and education of township and village cadres, and have corrected the past style of doing everything for them. In the past, some district cadres in Changning District, Yongshou County, regarded township and village cadres as "errand runners" - helping them to hold meetings, find people, find accommodation, and distribute meals. During this summer grain requisition, after the county and district grain requisition work teams arrived, they first convened township and village-level cadres to jointly study the grain requisition regulations and discuss and formulate work plans; after problems were found in the work, they convened township and village cadres to study and solve them together. Therefore, the working ability of township and village cadres was improved, the enthusiasm of township and village cadres was brought into play, and the confidence in completing tasks was enhanced. Everyone said, "Now we have found the way to work!" The head of Linxia County, Gansu Province, personally led more than 60 cadres to work in the countryside, helping cadres solve difficulties in their work, thereby improving the cadres' confidence in their work. During the second time they went to the countryside, the cadres scrambled to sign up to work in the countryside.

In addition, some cadres have begun to pay attention to investigation and research, grasp specific materials to solve problems, and reduce the previous subjective estimation of numbers. For example, in some districts of Chenggu last year, the distinction between public grain and local grain was not clear during grain requisition, and the exact figures could not be obtained even after repeated statistics. After the rectification, a careful investigation and statistics were carried out from the county to the village, and accurate figures have been obtained. In addition, most cadres have paid attention to studying policies and publicizing and explaining policies to the masses. The phenomenon of lack of organization and discipline, such as not asking for instructions or reporting, has also decreased, and they are generally able to report the situation to the higher authorities in a timely manner. When there are major problems, they ask the higher authorities for instructions.

However, in a small number of cadres, there is also another phenomenon. Some cadres show that they are tied up, and all problems, big and small, are reported to the higher authorities for decision. Some cadres still have simple working methods and are emotionally impatient; the erroneous thinking of some cadres that "if you don't hit good people, won't you hit bad people?" has not been completely eliminated, so the phenomenon of tying and scolding people has occurred again. For example, Han Zhihua and others from the Communist Youth League Committee of Fengxiang County tied up Li Zhiyi, a landlord who concealed land and did not confess it, when they were collecting grain in Liulin District. After the district office discovered this, it has been corrected and ordered to apologize to the masses in the village.

### 西北部分县区干部整风后  作风开始转变工作获得成绩

　　西北部分县区干部整风后
    作风开始转变工作获得成绩
    【本报讯】综合西安群众日报消息：陕西、甘肃大部县、区干部，经过整风学习以后，思想、作风开始转变，各种工作已做出相当成绩。首先表现在各县领导上开始克服布置多、检查少的现象。宝鸡分区在夏季征粮中，建立了巡回检查制度。各县县长、县委书记及部、科长等领导干部，有组织有计划地深入下层去检查工作，发现问题及时处理，以保证工作顺利进行。例如宝鸡县长王笃于八月初旬在西坪、金陵、神农等区巡回检查工作时，发现西坪区在评产中，干部与群众讨价还价的现象后，当即予以纠正。群众对人民政府、共产党因此有了进一步的认识。他们说：“庄稼汉看到田禾树树上有杈杈就搬了，共产党看见干部有一点毛病，就很快给去掉啦！”陕南城固县，南乐、原公、城关等区，也加强了对工作的检查，一个月来各召集二次至三次的乡干部检查工作会议（编者按：检查工作会议是必要的，但太多了，同样会影响到下面的工作；并易于流为形式。南乐等区一月召集两次到三次检查会议就有些多。检查工作的办法应当是多种多样的，如宝鸡分区的巡回检查，以及其他地区的重点检查等等，都是很好的检查方法。）。
    其次区乡干部的作风也有了转变，采用有事和群众商量的办法，因此工作获得了显著成绩。城固县的抗旱保苗工作，经过各级干部积极和群众商量想办法，终于战胜了旱灾。仅南乐一区抗旱中即动员起民工一○、三二○人，挖通十四道水渠，十天内打井一百七十二口。各区并组织了巡渠队，制定放水公约，抢水纠纷因此大大减少。在剿匪工作上，发动群众，展开了群众性的清匪运动，二十天内即捕获惯匪七名，争取土匪二十三名，严重的打击了该区的土匪活动，社会秩序逐渐安定。宝鸡分区各县在去年缴粮中，隐瞒土地的现象相当普遍。今年采用发动群众自报的方式，查出大批黑地。汧阳柿沟区四个乡去年仅登记土地三万四千多亩，今年即登记六万七千多亩，较去年几乎多出一倍。
    再次，各地县、区级干部开始注意了对乡、村干部的培养和教育，纠正了过去包办代替的作风。永寿县常宁区某些区干部过去把乡、村干部看成是“跑腿”——替他们开会找人、找住处、派饭等。这次夏征时，县、区征粮工作组到达后，首先召集乡、村级干部共同研究征粮条例，讨论制定工作计划；工作中发现问题后，又召集乡、村干部一起研究解决。因此提高了乡、村干部的工作能力，发挥了乡村干部的积极性，增强了完成任务的信心。大家都说：“这一下可摸着工作的门道啦！”甘肃临夏县县长亲自带领六十余干部下乡工作，帮助干部解决工作中的困难问题，由此提高了干部的工作信心。第二次下乡时，干部争先恐后的报名要求下乡工作。
    另外，有些干部已开始注意调查研究，掌握具体材料去解决问题，减少了以往主观估计数字的现象。如城固去年有些区在征粮中，没有分清公粮和地方粮，曾再三统计也没有弄出确实的数字。整风后，由县到村进行了仔细的调查统计，已得出确切数字。此外，大多数干部已注意研究政策及向群众宣传解释政策。过去不请示不报告的无组织无纪律现象也已减少，一般已能及时向上级反映情况。有重大问题时就向上级请示。
    但在很少的干部中，也存在着另一种现象，有些干部表现了束手束脚，大小问题都请示上级决定。有些干部仍然是工作方式简单，情绪急躁；有些干部“不打好人，还不打坏人吗？”的错误思想还未彻底肃清，所以又发生了捆人、骂人的现象。如凤翔县团工委韩志华等在柳林区征粮，地主李志义隐瞒土地不坦白，就用绳捆。经区公署发现后，已予以纠正，并令其向该村群众道歉。
