Xinhua News Agency: The railway, highway, and shipping industries in the Northeast and Southwest regions are rapidly recovering and developing. Currently, the operational railway lines in Northeast China have reached over 10,000 kilometers, employing over 200,000 workers. When the Northeast region was fully liberated, 80% of the highways were damaged and impassable. In the past two years, the People's Government mobilized 4.3 million people and over 732,000 vehicles to repair over 8,000 kilometers of highway subgrades and surfaces, and to build and repair over 2,320 large and small bridges, culverts, retaining structures, and other constructions. At present, the Northeast Highway Bureau controls 109 operational lines (excluding Rehe Province), totaling over 9,000 kilometers, an increase of 86% compared to last year. According to statistics from the end of May this year, a total of over 176,000 tons of goods and 1.4 million passengers were transported in the previous year and a half. In order to further align highways with the needs of national economic development and to supplement the inadequacy of railway transportation, the People's Government is accelerating the planning and construction of new lines.

Since its opening, Northeast shipping has also overcome numerous difficulties and established a relatively normal navigation order. The speed of some routes has more than doubled compared to the past. Currently, various new construction projects related to shipping are actively underway.

As of September, 80% of the 17,500 kilometers of national and provincial highways in the Southwest region have been repaired and opened to traffic. When the Kuomintang bandit gangs fled, they extensively destroyed the local highways, leaving all lines in a fragmented state. Among them, 105 bridges were destroyed, totaling more than 3,000 meters of construction. After the liberation of various places in the Southwest region, the People's Government immediately carried out highway restoration projects with great effort. According to June statistics, in the first half of this year, 93 national highway bridges were rebuilt and repaired, totaling 1,700 meters; 143 large and small provincial highway bridges were repaired and rebuilt. The massive Sichuan-Xikang Highway and the Kangqing Highway, which had been abandoned during the Kuomintang rule, were simultaneously undergoing restoration and construction.

With the gradual restoration of the highway network, highway transportation in the region has gradually developed. Compared with the transportation volume in February at the beginning of liberation, the passenger transportation volume of the public-owned automobile transportation industry in July exceeded 33 times, and the freight transportation volume exceeded 36 times. With the government's active reorganization and support, the private automobile transportation industry has also greatly improved. At present, the number of private cars in operation has reached more than 1,000, and the average transportation volume has increased by one to two times compared with May.

In addition to the full operation of waterway shipping routes, the 20,000-plus li of wooden boat routes, which play an important role in transportation in the Southwest, have also largely recovered with the suppression of local bandits and the smooth flow of material exchanges. With the strong support and assistance of the People's Government, more than 90% of the shipping industry in the region has resumed business operations.

The 26 private shipping companies in Chongqing, which had been suspended for eight months before liberation, have successively received government loans seven times in the past six months, totaling over 9.3 billion yuan. Private shipping companies in Chongqing, such as Minsheng, Qianghua, and Hezhong, have gradually reached profitability from losses. At present, the waterway transportation business in the Southwest region has made significant progress. According to statistics from Chongqing alone, compared with April, the export transportation volume in June exceeded 63% for freight and 53% for passengers. Wooden boats, which are the main tools for transporting and selling local products in the Southwest, have a total tonnage several times that of ships. After liberation, the People's Government has carried out key rectification and management work on the industry and helped it to eliminate the feudal gang forces that exploited it at every level. The industry has now also shown significant improvement.

In addition, the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which plays a significant role in the development of Southwest economic construction, is also progressing rapidly.

The rapid restoration of transportation construction in the Southwest has had a great impact on the improvement of the economic life of the people in the region. From March to June this year, a total of over 90,000 tons of food were transferred from the Southwest to other regions; the sales of local specialties in various parts of the Southwest, which had been unsalable for nearly a year, have also become increasingly active due to the improvement of transportation conditions.

　　东北西南交通事业迅速发展
    对经济建设起了重大作用
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：东北、西南地区的铁路、公路及航运事业正迅速恢复和发展中。目前东北铁路行车线路已达一万余公里，拥有职工二十余万人。东北公路在东北全境解放时，全部线路有百分之八十被破坏不能通车。人民政府在最近两年内动员了四百三十万人，七十三万二千余辆大车，整修公路路基路面八千余公里，新建与补修的大小桥梁、涵洞、护岸构造物等达二千三百二十余座。目前东北公路总局所掌握的营业线路已有一百零九条（热河省除外），共计九千余公里，比去年增加百分之八十六。据今年五月底统计，前此一年半时间共运送了物资十七万六千余吨，旅客一百四十万人。人民政府为了使公路进一步配合国民经济开展的需要，以补助铁路运输的不足，正在加紧计划和修建新的线路。
    东北航运自开航以来，亦克服重重困难，建立了比较正常的航行秩序。有的航线航行速率较过去提高了一倍以上。目前有关航运的各种新的建筑工程正在积极进行中。
    截至九月止，西南全区一万七千五百公里国道，省道公路，已有百分之八十修复通车。国民党匪帮于溃逃时曾对当地公路大肆破坏，使全部线路陷入支离破碎的状态。其中桥梁被破坏即达一百零五座，计工程三千多公尺。西南全区各地解放后，人民政府即以巨大力量进行公路的恢复工程。据六月份统计，今年上半年全区国道公路各式桥梁重建和修复的有九十三座，计一千七百公尺；省道公路大小桥梁整修和重建的有一百四十三座。工程浩大的川康公路及国民党统治时期即已废弃的康青公路均同时进行了恢复和修建工程。
    随着公路网的渐次恢复，全区公路运输业务已逐渐开展。公营汽车运输业七月份运输量与解放初期二月份的运输量相较，客运量超过三十三倍，货运量超过三十六倍。私营汽车运输业经政府积极整理扶助，业务亦大为好转，目前私车行驶数量已达千余辆，平均运输量仅五月前后相较即增加一倍到两倍。
    水路交通除轮运航线全部通航外，在西南交通运输上占有重要地位的二万余华里木船航线，也随着各地土匪的肃清及物资交流畅旺而大部恢复。全区航运业在人民政府大力扶助和帮助之下，已有百分之九十以上恢复业务经营。
    解放前停航达八个月的重庆二十六家私营轮船公司，半年来先后获得政府贷款七次，约九十三亿余元；重庆私营民生、强华、合众及其他轮船公司等都已由赔累逐渐达到盈余。目前西南全区轮运业务已有显著的进展。仅重庆一地统计，出口运输量六月份与四月份相较，货运超过百分之六十三，客运超过百分之五十三。为西南土产运销主要工具的木船，其总吨位超过轮船总吨位数倍。解放后人民政府对该业有重点地进行了整顿管理工作，并帮助该业清除了对该业实行层层剥削的封建帮会势力。现该业亦已有显著的好转。
    此外，对发展西南经济建设有重大作用的成渝铁路的修建工程亦在迅速进展中。
    西南交通建设的迅速恢复对全区人民经济生活的改善影响很大，今年三月到六月，由西南调运外区的食粮共达九万余吨；滞销近一年的西南各地特产销售，也因运输条件的改善而日趋活跃。
