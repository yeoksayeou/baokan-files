Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 5th. People in the old liberated areas of the Land Revolution era in southwestern and northeastern Jiangxi are enthusiastically bringing out paper money issued by the democratic governments of the Land Revolution war era to exchange for Renminbi at local People's Banks. In the past month, over 300,000 yuan of the old currency has been redeemed in Ganzhou, Xingguo, Ningdu, and Yiyang alone. More than half of Jiangxi Province was old liberated areas during the Land Revolution era. The paper money issued by the democratic governments at that time had stable value and wide circulation, and was supported by the broad masses. After the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army went north to fight against the Japanese, the Kuomintang reactionary bandits threatened the local people not to keep these banknotes. In Tongjiafang, Yushan County, two farmers were even shot for keeping the revolutionary banknotes. However, the unyielding people firmly believed that the Communist Party would be victorious, and they cleverly hid the banknotes for fifteen years. Red Army Mama Liu Yangshi of Zhugang Village, a suburb of the red capital Ruijin, said: "The fields and clothes were snatched away, but the Red Army banknotes could not be snatched away. Seeing them is like seeing the Red Army, like seeing Chairman Mao." She rolled the banknotes into a bamboo tube, sealed it, and hid it under the eaves, and later secretly sewed it into the soles of her shoes, and has kept it until now. Since the People's Government announced the redemption, the people holding these banknotes have gone to the People's Bank to exchange them, and excitedly recounted the stories of storing these banknotes. Xie Changhua, a farmer from Nantang District, Gan County, said: "Each old yuan can be exchanged for 1,500 yuan of Renminbi. Chairman Mao cares about us so much."

　　政府收兑土地革命时代货币
    江西人民感谢毛主席
    【新华社南昌五日电】前土地革命时代的老解放区赣西南、赣东北地区的人民，纷纷拿出土地革命战争时代民主政府所发行的纸币，向当地人民银行兑换人民币。月来仅赣州、兴国、宁都、义阳四处已收兑当时钞票三十多万元。江西省有二分之一以上地区是土地革命时代的老解放区，当时民主政府所发行的纸币，币值稳定，流通很广，曾为广大群众所拥护。中国工农红军北上抗日后，国民党反动匪帮威胁当地人民不得保存这些钞票。玉山县童家坊有两个农民，为保存革命纸币竟遭枪杀。但不屈的人民坚信共产党是会胜利的，他们把钞票巧妙地贮藏了十五年。红色首都瑞金城郊竹岗村红军妈妈刘杨氏说：“田地和衣服给抢去了，但红军钞票是不能给抢去的，看见了它，就像看见了红军，看见了毛主席一样。”她把钞票卷进竹筒，封好藏在屋檐下，后来又机密地缝在鞋底里，一直保存到现在。自人民政府宣布收兑后，持有这些钞票的人民，均到人民银行去兑换，并兴奋地叙述着贮藏这些钞票的故事。赣县南塘区农民谢昌华说：“每元老票兑换人民币一千五百元，毛主席太关怀我们了。”
