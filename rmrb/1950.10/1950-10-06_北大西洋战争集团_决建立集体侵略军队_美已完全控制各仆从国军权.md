　　North Atlantic War Group
    Decides to Establish Collective Aggression Army
    US Has Completely Controlled Military Power of All Vassal States
    [News Agency report] According to Xinhua News Agency: The fifth meeting of the North Atlantic Aggression Group Council was held in New York on September 15, 16, and 18, and then adjourned. The final meeting was held on the 26th. The communiqué issued after the meeting revealed that, under the intensified pressure from the United States, the countries of the North Atlantic Aggression Group have agreed to "establish a unified command joint army as soon as possible" under the North Atlantic Treaty Council, and the United States has obtained complete control over this aggressive army. The communiqué does not shy away from stating: "This army will be commanded by a Supreme Commander, who will be given full authority to ensure that the troops of various countries assigned to his command are organized and trained into an efficient joint force." In effect, this establishes the position of the United States to completely manipulate the military power of its vassal states. Although all the countries that "contribute troops," which are actually supplying cannon fodder, are to organize an "international staff group," its task is limited to "assisting" this "Supreme Commander," who has already been internally determined to be an American.
    According to the communiqué and the announcement by the Council's spokesperson: The detailed methods for organizing this collective aggression army and the appointment of the Supreme Commander will be discussed and decided by the "Defense Committee" composed of the defense ministers of the North Atlantic Aggression Group countries. Before the Supreme Commander is appointed, a Chief of Staff "responsible for training and organization matters" will be appointed first.
    The communiqué reveals that, while gaining control of the North Atlantic Group's aggressive army, the United States has further proposed excluding the power of the Western European Union military group under the leadership of Britain, and taking sole command of the Western European armed forces into its own hands. To this end, the communiqué announced: "The Council also requested the Defense Committee to consider the changes and simplifications required in the military institutions and related military organizations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."
    The Council did not make a clear decision on the issue of arming West Germany. This shows that as a result of the United States' use of pressure in various ways at the meetings of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain and France, the meetings of defense ministers, and the meetings of the North Atlantic Treaty Council, it has not been able to completely overcome the resistance of the governments of Western European countries, first and foremost the French government, which are deeply fearful of the opposition of their own people, but the communiqué stated: "The Council agreed that Germany should be enabled to contribute to the establishment of Western European defense, and pointed out that the occupying powers are studying the request that the Defense Committee make recommendations as soon as possible on the most effective way Germany can contribute." Therefore, the United States is obviously still continuing to intensify pressure to drag West Germany into the North Atlantic Aggression Army.

　　北大西洋战争集团
    决建立集体侵略军队
    美已完全控制各仆从国军权
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：北大西洋侵略集团理事会第五次会议前于九月十五、十六、十八日在纽约开会后，即行休会，至二十六日举行了末次会议。会后发表的会议公报透露，在美国加紧压力下，北大西洋侵略集团各国已同意在北大西洋公约理事会之下“尽早建立一支统一指挥的联合军队”，而美国已取得了完全控制这支侵略军的大权。公报毫不讳言：“这支军队将由一最高司令官统率，该司令官将被授以充分权力以保证拨归他指挥的各国部队组织与训练成一支有效率的联合部队”。实际上这就是为美国确定了它完全操纵其仆从国家军权的地位。虽然一切所谓“供献军队”，实即供给炮灰的国家要组织一个“国际参谋团”，但是其任务却仅限于“协助”这个已内定由美国人的来充任的“最高司令官”。
    据公报与理事会发言人宣布：组织这支集体侵略军的详细办法以及最高司令官的任命将由北大西洋侵略集团各国国防部长组成的“防务委员会”来商讨决定。而在最高司令官任命以前，将先任命一名“负责训练与组织事宜”的参谋长。
    公报透露，与取得北大西洋集团侵略军的控制权同时，美国已进一步提出排除英国主持下的西欧联盟军事集团的力量，而使自己掌握西欧武装部队单一指挥权的要求。为此，公报宣布：“理事会还请求防务委员会考虑在北大西洋公约组织的军事机构及有关军事组织方面所要求的改变与简化”。
    理事会在武装西德问题上未作出明白决定。这表明美国在美英法三国外长会议，国防部长会议以及北大西洋公约理事会会议上多方使用压力的结果，并没有能够完全克服由于深深惧怕其本国人民反对的西欧各国政府，首先是法国政府的抗拒，但是公报声明：“理事会同意应使德国能够对建立西欧的防务有所供献，并曾指出：占领国正在研究要求防务委员会尽早就德国能够作最有效的供献的方法提出建议”。因此美国显然仍在继续为把西德拖入北大西洋侵略军而加紧压力。
