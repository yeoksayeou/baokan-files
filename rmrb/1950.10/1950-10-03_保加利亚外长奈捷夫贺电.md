Xinhua News Agency, 30th. Bulgarian People's Republic Foreign Minister Naydenov sent a telegram to our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, congratulating our country on National Day. The text of the telegram is as follows:
    To Mr. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:
    On the occasion of the National Day of the People's Republic of China, please accept my heartfelt congratulations, and I hope that you, together with the people's democratic countries, following the path to a free and happy life and the path to brotherly and sincere international relations opened up for us by the great fortress of peace, the Soviet Union, will continue to victoriously carry out the struggle to defend world peace.
    I have no doubt that the Chinese people's participation in the struggle to defend world peace with such a brilliant victory over the reactionaries will be praised as much as the Chinese people's struggle for their own independence.
    Long live the great Chinese people and their government headed by the wise and courageous leader Mao Zedong!
    Naydenov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Bulgaria
    September 29, 1950

　　保加利亚外长奈捷夫贺电
    【新华社三十日讯】保加利亚人民共和国外交部长奈捷夫致电我周恩来外长，祝贺我国国庆。电文如下：中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来先生：
    值此中华人民共和国国庆之际，请您接受我衷心的祝贺，并希望你和各人民民主国家在一起，随着伟大的和平堡垒苏联给我们所开辟的通向自由幸福生活之路，通向兄弟友谊般诚意的国际关系之路。继续胜利地进行保卫世界和平的斗争。
    我毫不怀疑，中国人民以其对反动派如此辉煌的胜利参加保卫世界和平的斗争，定将如中国人民为自己独立的斗争一样受到赞扬。
    伟大的中国人民及其以英明而勇敢的领袖毛泽东为首的政府万岁！
    保加利亚人民共和国外交部长奈捷夫
    一九五○年九月二十九日
