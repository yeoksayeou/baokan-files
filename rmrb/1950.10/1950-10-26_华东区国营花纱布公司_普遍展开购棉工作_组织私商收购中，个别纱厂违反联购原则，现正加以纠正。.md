Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 24th - The East China State-Run Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's various levels of institutions have universally launched the work of purchasing new cotton. As of October 10th, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company had collected 300,000 dan of ginned cotton, accounting for over 60% of the market transactions, exceeding the planned target.

This year, new cotton in the East China region was on the market half a month earlier than expected. The state-run specialized company, due to insufficient foresight regarding this, and inadequate preparation to adapt to objective needs in a timely manner, experienced a general phenomenon of cotton stagnation and private merchants undercutting prices from late August to early September. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, due to establishing additional institutions in cotton-producing areas in mid-September, expanded the entrusted cooperative's acquisition, and in areas with fewer cooperatives, also entrusted a small number of private merchants to collect cotton on their behalf. Since early October, the situation has begun to improve.

The China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's East China branch paid attention to organizing private merchants to purchase cotton during the acquisition process, consulted with the East China Public-Private Joint Cotton Purchasing Committee to allocate acquisition tasks and acquisition locations, and helped Shanghai cotton merchants organize joint operations. The Joint Purchase Committee and the Cotton Merchant Joint Management Office have both begun purchasing in various locations. However, it has now been discovered that individual private yarn factories that have participated in joint purchases are violating the principle of "joint purchase, no self-purchase," and are independently purchasing elsewhere. Relevant departments are paying attention to correcting this.

　　华东区国营花纱布公司
    普遍展开购棉工作
    组织私商收购中，个别纱厂违反联购原则，现正加以纠正。
    【新华社上海二十四日电】华东国营花纱布公司各级机构已普遍展开收购新棉的工作。截至十月十日止，花纱布公司已收皮棉三十万担，约占市场成交量百分之六十以上，超额完成预定计划。
    华东地区今年新棉较预期提前半月上市。国营专业公司由于对此预见不足，准备工作未能及时适应客观需要，八月下旬至九月上旬，普遍发生了棉花滞销、私商杀价的现象。花纱布公司因于九月中旬在产锦区增设机构，扩大委托合作社收购，在合作社较少的部分地区，并委托少数私商代收。十月上旬以来，情况已开始改善。
    中国花纱布公司华东区公司在收购中注意组织私商收购的工作，与华东公私营纱厂联合购棉委员会协商分配了收购任务和收购地点，帮助上海棉商组织联营。联购委员会和棉商联营处均已在各地开始收购。但现已发现个别已参加联购的私营纱厂违反“联购不自购”的原则，自己在他处单独收购。有关方面正注意加以纠正。
