　　In Memory of Comrade Bi Shishi!
    Kǎifēng
    The unfortunate news of your passing heavily stirred my heart, causing me to lose a mentor and close friend, and I feel boundless sorrow!
    Recalling you, as a Chinese revolutionary fighter, a fighter of the international working class—a comrade-in-arms of Comrade Mao Zedong, you were a fighter with noble revolutionary qualities. Your rich experience in the Chinese revolutionary struggle, profound understanding of Marxist-Leninist theory, patriotic fervor and internationalist spirit, revolutionary heroism and humble and amiable demeanor, and ardent dedication to serving the people and working for the Party, were principles consistently upheld throughout your life of revolutionary struggle.
    You—an outstanding warrior of the Chinese nation, a leader of the Chinese revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, a pioneer and leader of the Chinese youth movement, in thirty years of long, complex, arduous, and persistent struggle, with a loyal and self-sacrificing spirit, you fought to the end for the independence of the Chinese nation, for the liberation of the Chinese people, and for the cause of the Chinese working class!
    Your death is a great loss to the entire nation, the entire Party, and the entire army. Your death is a great sorrow for the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire nation! The entire nation, the entire Party, and the entire army will continue your cause, learn from your example, rally closely around the banner of Comrade Mao Zedong, and work even harder to commemorate you! Bi Shishi, rest in peace!
