Xinhua News Agency, dispatch from Pyongyang, 7th: TASS Pyongyang, 5th: Under the pressure of the American army, which is numerically superior and supported by a large number of tanks and airplanes, the People's Army was forced to withdraw from several liberated areas and retreat to new defense lines. The news that a grave danger is looming over Korea has stirred up the entire people. Everyone who has remained in the rear until now has risen up to defend the motherland. They are joining the People's Army to defend the freedom and independence of their motherland together with Korea's renowned heroes.

Mass rallies are being held in enterprises, government offices, villages, and schools. Laboring people are giving speeches at the meetings, denouncing the despicable American aggressors and declaring their determination to resist the aggressors and defend the motherland. Many people set out for the front lines of their just war of liberation immediately after the meetings. Patriotic youths from all over Korea are writing letters requesting to be sent to the front lines immediately. Worker Gao Qinan (transliteration) said when he set off for the front lines: Koreans are not slaves who can be intimidated by the enemy. Many enterprises in various parts of Korea have held gatherings and meetings, and at every meeting, the laboring people have pledged to crush the enemy and defend their freedom and independence. The female workers and elderly male workers who remain in the factories say that they will take over the work of those who have gone to the front in the rear, and supply the army with the necessary munitions and equipment.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th: A general bumper harvest has been achieved in all parts of northern Korea, and the peasants are busy harvesting cotton, while preparing to pay cotton tax in kind in advance to support the front. The cotton planting area in the northern half of the country exceeds this year's production plan by 4.8 percent. Farmers in cotton-producing areas such as Yonggang County and Jiangxi County in South Pyongan Province, and Jaeryong County in Hwanghae Province, overcame a fairly severe drought and launched a struggle to increase cotton production to support the front, with the result that the cotton harvest per mu exceeded the planned production target.

    各企业、机关、乡村和学校都纷纷举行群众大会。劳动人民们在会上发表演说，斥责可耻的美国侵略者，并且宣布了他们抵抗侵略者和保卫祖国的决心。许多人在散会后，就马上起程前赴他们正义的解放战争的前线。朝鲜各地的爱国青年纷纷来信，要求立刻让他们上前线去。工人高齐南（译音）在起程上前线的时候说：朝鲜人并不是敌人能威吓得住的奴隶。朝鲜各地的许多企业都举行了集会和会议，在每一个地方的会议上，劳动人民都保证要粉碎敌人，保卫他们的自由和独立。仍留在厂内的女工和年老男工说，他们将在后方接替上前线者的工作，供给军队以必要的军火和装备。
    【新华社平壤七日电】朝鲜北半部各地普遍丰收，农民们正忙着收获棉花，同时准备提前缴纳棉花现物税，以支援前线。北半部种植棉花的较今年度生产计划超过百分之四点八。平安南道龙岗县、江西县和黄海道载宁县等产棉地区的农民，克服了相当严重的旱灾，展开增产棉花支援前线的斗争，结果使每亩地的棉花收获量超过预定的生产目标。
