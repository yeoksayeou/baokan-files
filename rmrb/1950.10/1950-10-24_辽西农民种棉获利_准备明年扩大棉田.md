　　Liaoxi Farmers Profit from Cotton Planting
    Prepare to Expand Cotton Fields Next Year

    [By Our Correspondent] A message from the Liaoxi Daily: Cotton farmers in Liaoxi Province, a major cotton-producing area in Northeast China, have achieved a widespread bumper harvest, unprecedented in the past four years. Farmers are actively selecting seeds and preparing to expand cotton fields next year.

    This year, the province planted 121,000 hectares of cotton, with an estimated yield of 1,200 jin of seed cotton per hectare, totaling 145,200,000 jin of seed cotton. Based on the current ratio of cotton to grain prices, the income from 121,000 hectares of cotton is equivalent to the grain production of 400,000 hectares of ordinary farmland. For example, Huiqu Village in the Third District of Heishan County planted 93 hectares of cotton, which can be exchanged for at least 2,600 dan of sorghum, equivalent to the grain yield of 449 hectares of ordinary farmland. The village's income from cotton fields alone, after deducting food for people and livestock and payment of public grain, leaves a surplus of more than 770 dan of grain. Another example is Yi County, which planted 15,000 hectares of cotton this year, with an estimated minimum yield of over 1,800 jin of seed cotton per hectare, which can be exchanged for over 296,000 dan of sorghum. The 15,000 hectares of cotton are equivalent to the harvest from 50,000 hectares of ordinary farmland.

    After the bumper cotton harvest, the cotton farmers are all beaming with joy. Currently, cotton farmers in various regions are actively engaged in field seed selection while picking cotton, preparing to expand the area of cotton fields next year. People's governments at all levels are also paying attention to leading this work. In order to do a good job in seed selection and strive to eliminate inferior and hybrid varieties within three years, the Provincial People's Government has specifically established 67 purebred zones and 32 seed breeding nurseries in various regions; and established eleven ginneries in key cotton-producing counties, specializing in ginning work, in order to identify seed grades and separately preserve good seeds. In addition, it also organized 130 teachers and students from Xingcheng Agricultural Vocational School to go to 21 counties and cities to promote seed selection work. According to the requirements of farmers throughout the province to grow more cotton, the province plans to expand cotton fields to 200,000 hectares next year.

　　辽西农民种棉获利
    准备明年扩大棉田
    【本报讯】辽西日报消息：东北产棉区——辽西省的棉农，获得四年来所未有的普遍丰收。农民正积极进行选种，准备明年扩大棉田。
    该省今年植棉十二万一千垧，估计每垧可摘籽棉一千二百斤，共摘籽棉一亿四千五百二十万斤。按目前棉粮比价计算，十二万一千垧棉花的收益，能顶四十万垧大田的产粮。如黑山县三区会区村，种棉九十三垧，最少能换两千六百多石高粱，等于大田四百四十九垧地的收粮数目。该村仅棉田的收入，除人、畜食用与交公粮外，还余七百七十多石粮。又如义县今年种棉一万五千垧，估计每垧最低能收籽棉一千八百多斤，共可换高粱二十九万六千多石。一万五千垧棉花，赶上了五万垧大田的收成。
    棉田丰收后，棉农们都喜形于色。目前各地棉农正结合摘棉积极进行田间选种，准备明年扩大棉田面积，各级人民政府也注意了领导这一工作。该省人民政府为把选种工作作好，以争取在三年内淘汰劣种、杂种，特意在各地建立了六十七个纯种区、三十二个培种圃；并在产棉重点县成立了十一个轧花厂，专门作轧花工作，以鉴别种籽等级，分别保存良种。此外，还组织了兴城农职学校师生一百三十人分赴二十一个县、市，推动选种工作。根据全省农民多种棉的要求，该省准备明年扩大棉田到二十万垧。
