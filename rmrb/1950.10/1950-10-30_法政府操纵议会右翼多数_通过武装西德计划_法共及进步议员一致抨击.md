　　French Government Manipulates Right-Wing Parliamentary Majority
    To Pass Plan for Arming West Germany
    French Communist Party and Progressive Deputies Unanimously Condemn
    [Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch] Under the increasing pressure from the United States, the French government of René Pleven has submitted to the French parliament and, relying on the right-wing majority within the parliament, passed its plan to agree with the American decision to arm West Germany, as the price for the recent 2.6 billion US dollar "military aid" from the United States to France.

    Pleven presented his plan to the parliament under the guise of "opposing the arming of West Germany." The plan stipulates that West Germany, like other Marshall Plan countries in Western Europe, should provide manpower, equipment, materials, and supplies for a unified Western European army. This plan was attacked by the French Communist Party deputies and other progressive deputies, and even some right-wing deputies, during the debates in the French National Assembly from the 24th to the 26th. They all pointed out that the Pleven government's plan was merely a disguise for accepting the American plan.

    Although, during the vote in parliament on the 26th, 343 votes from various right-wing parties were in favor of the government's plan, 225 members of the Communist Party, the Progressive Republican Union, and other progressive deputies voted resolutely against it, with another 21 abstaining. The United Press also pointed out: "Parliament approved the government plan without enthusiasm." On the same day that the French parliament passed its plan, French Defense Minister Moch hurriedly took the plan to Washington. However, the French plan is still far from the more direct American approach of establishing German divisions and incorporating them into the North Atlantic aggressive army, therefore Pleven's efforts are still met with dissatisfaction from his American masters. U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, at a press conference on the 25th, while expressing welcome to the French plan on the one hand, emphasized on the other hand that "further study is needed," foreshadowing further pressure on France to accept the will of the United States.

　　法政府操纵议会右翼多数
    通过武装西德计划
    法共及进步议员一致抨击
    【新华社二十九日讯】在美国不断增加压力下，法国普利文政府已向法国议会提出，并凭借议会内右翼多数通过了它同意美国武装西德决定的计划，作为美国最近予法国二十六亿美元“军事援助”的代价。
    普利文是在“反对武装西德”的伪装面目下向议会提出其计划的。计划中规定西德同西欧其他各马歇尔化国家一样以兵员，装备，物资，供给一支统一西欧军队。这一计划，在二十四日至二十六日法国国民议会辩论中受到了法国共产党议员与其他进步议员甚至若干右翼议员的抨击。他们都指出：普利文政府的计划不过是在接受美国计划时的一种掩饰。
    虽然，议会于二十六日表决时，有各右翼政党的三百四十三票赞成政府计划，但共产党，进步共和联盟及其他进步议员二百二十五人却投票坚决反对，另有二十一票弃权，连合众社也指出：“议会情绪不热烈地批准了政府计划”。在法国议会通过其计划的当日，法国国防部长莫克即把该项计划匆匆带往华盛顿。但是，法国计划与美国要求建立德军师团，编入北大西洋侵略军的更直截的作法还有距离，因此普利文的努力仍然受到其美国主子的不满。美国国务卿艾奇逊二十五日在记者招待会上，一方面虽对法国计划表示欢迎，另一方面却强调还“需要进一步研究”。预示将再逼迫法国进一步接受美国的意志。
