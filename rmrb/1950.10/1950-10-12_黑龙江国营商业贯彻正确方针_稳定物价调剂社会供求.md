　　Heilongjiang State-Owned Commerce Implements Correct Policies
    Stabilizing Prices and Regulating Social Supply and Demand
    [This Newspaper Dispatches] Over the past year, Heilongjiang's state-owned commercial enterprises have basically completed the task of regulating supply and demand and stabilizing prices, and have supported the people's cooperative undertakings and private enterprises, correctly implementing the policy of state-owned commerce serving the people's production and life.

    Over the past year, Heilongjiang's state-owned commercial departments have purchased 760,000 tons of grain and 1.2 trillion yuan (Northeast currency, same below) of by-products and industrial raw materials. This has encouraged farmers' enthusiasm for production and expanded their purchasing power. In terms of meeting the people's needs, state-owned commerce has supplied the people with 1.4 million bolts of cloth, 2,000 tons of cotton, 1.7 trillion yuan worth of general merchandise, 1,500 tons of kerosene, 1,800 tons of soybean oil, 25,000 tons of edible salt, 12,000 tons of soybean cake, and 150,000 tons of coal. These efforts have not only appropriately regulated social supply and demand, promoted the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and maintained price stability since the establishment of the Central People's Government a year ago, which is beneficial to the broad masses of people and has won widespread praise.

    At the same time, trading companies purchased raw materials and promoted products for Northeast state-owned industries, accounting for more than 50% of the total value of supplied goods, opening up sales channels for state-owned industrial products. Furthermore, since 40% to 50% of the purchase of agricultural products and the sale of goods was done through cooperatives, it also promoted the development of cooperatives. The number of cooperative members increased from one million to over two million, and the capital increased from 350 billion to over 700 billion.

    The processing and ordering of state-owned trade have also played a considerable role in the recovery and development of private enterprises, with a total value of over 120 billion yuan in processing and ordering over the past year.

    Because state-owned commerce mainly engages in wholesale business and actively supports private commerce, creating conditions for private businesses to obtain legitimate profits, private commerce has also developed. Private commerce accounts for about 60% of the total social circulation value, which is a considerable proportion.

    In order to adapt to the needs of the rapid recovery and development of the Northeast national economy, the Heilongjiang Trading Company has also paid attention to improving its work. First, it conducted investigations and research on social purchasing power and commodity supply, and took into account the connection of various economies in the plan, overcoming the blindness in procurement and sales, and ensuring the accuracy of the main operating commodity figures, so as to adapt to the planned economic construction beginning in the Northeast.

    Secondly, it overcame the past long-standing practice of the large supply system, determined the capital of provinces and counties, carried out enterprise management, and implemented the enterprise management policy from accelerating commodity turnover, reducing consumption rates, and reducing operating expenses.

    Because the Heilongjiang Party Committee and government strengthened the leadership of commercial supply and marketing work, equipped cadres, and universally used the summer slack season to conduct a short-term rotational training for commercial cadres throughout the province; and after the rectification and study in July and August, the work was reviewed, policies were studied, and the mass perspective was further strengthened; self-criticism was carried out, and serious deviations such as corruption, waste, and irresponsibility were exposed, so that all staff members were improved in both business and politics. It has laid the foundation for state-owned commerce to better serve the people's production and life in the future.

### 黑龙江国营商业贯彻正确方针  稳定物价调剂社会供求

　　黑龙江国营商业贯彻正确方针
    稳定物价调剂社会供求
    【本报讯】一年来黑龙江国营商业基本上完成了调剂供求稳定物价的任务，并扶助了人民合作事业与私人企业，正确地贯彻了国营商业为人民生产和生活服务的方针。
    黑龙江国营商业部门一年来收购了七十六万吨粮食和一万二千亿元（东北币，下同）的副产物及工业原料。鼓励了农民的生产积极性，扩大了农民的购买力。在满足人民的需要上，国营商业一年来供应了人民布匹一百四十万匹，棉花二千吨，价值一万七千亿元的百货，一千五百吨煤油，一千八百吨豆油，二万五千吨食盐，一万二千吨豆饼及十五万吨煤炭。这些工作，不仅适当地调剂了社会供求，促进了城乡内外物资交流，并保持了从中央人民政府成立后一年来物价的平稳，这对广大人民是有利的，获得人民普遍的赞扬。
    同时，贸易公司为东北国营工业收购原料、推销产品，约占供应商品总价值百分之五十以上，为国营工业产品打开了销路。又由于收购农产品和推销商品时，百分之四十到五十以上是经过合作社的，因而也促进了合作社的发展，合作社社员由一百万发展到二百万以上，资金亦由三千五百亿发展到七千亿以上。
    国营贸易的加工、定货对私人企业的恢复与发展，也起了相当大的作用，一年来加工定货的总值在一千二百亿元以上。
    由于国营商业以经营批发业为主，并积极扶植私营商业，为私人商业创造了获取正当利润的条件，因而私营商业亦获得了发展。私人商业占社会流通总值的百分之六十左右，所占的比重是相当大的。
    黑龙江贸易公司为了适应东北国民经济迅速恢复与发展的需要，也注意了对工作的提高与改进。首先进行了对于社会购买力及商品供应的调查研究，从计划上照顾各种经济的衔接，克服了采购与推销上的盲目性，做到主要经营商品的数字准确，借以适应东北开始的计划性的经济建设。
    其次克服了过去长期存在的大供给制的作法，确定了省县资金，进行企业化管理，从加速商品周转减少消耗率及降低经营开支等方面，实行企业化的经营方针。
    由于黑龙江党委、政府对商业供销工作加强了领导，配备了干部，对全省范围的商业干部普遍的利用夏闲进行了一次短期轮训；又经过了七、八两个月的整风学习，检查了工作，学习了政策，进一步加强了群众观点；进行了自我批评，揭发了严重的贪污腐化浪费不负责任等偏向，故使全体工作人员不论在业务上政治上皆提高一步。替今后的国营商业更好的为人民的生产和生活服务打下了基础。
