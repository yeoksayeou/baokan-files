Hubei's Mianyang Special District: Most Cadres Complete Rectification, Overcoming Blind Complacency by Examining Key Work

[Report from this newspaper] Most county, district, and township cadres in Hubei's Mianyang Special District have completed rectification studies. Training for township and village cadres and activists will also be completed before the winter land reform movement (or rent reduction). The rectification of cadres in this special district was conducted by convening rectification meetings, short-term training classes, and combining these with district and township peasant representative meetings. The first enlarged cadre rectification meetings in each county were held at the end of July and the beginning of August, and the second were held around September 10. A total of 2,300 county, district, and township cadres participated in these two meetings. The Special Commissioner's Office and various counties also held cadre rectification meetings for the financial and economic systems in mid-August and late August, with 879 cadres participating, accounting for one-half of the existing financial and economic cadres. This basically completed the Mianyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China's pre-autumn cadre rectification plan. At the same time, the special district also held short-term cadre training classes. The Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has trained 566 in-service cadres from districts and townships. The county committees have trained 1,769 village cadres and activists. The total number of people trained in these two items accounts for one-half of the pre-autumn cadre training plan. The district's training of township and village cadres can be completed in early winter. In addition, after the two enlarged cadre meetings, various counties universally convened district and township peasant representative meetings to report on and examine work summaries to the representatives, solicit opinions, improve work, and improve leadership.

This rectification movement in the district basically implemented Chairman Mao's instruction of "closely integrating with various work tasks instead of separating from them." It examined and summarized key tasks such as anti-hegemony rent reduction, production for disaster relief, and preparation for land reform (or rent reduction), examined the implementation of policies, and examined leadership styles, changing the rectification method of simply rectifying thoughts and shortcomings. At the same time, at the beginning of the rectification, the leadership promptly dispelled the ideological concerns of the cadres, and made inspection and enlightenment reports, thereby promoting democracy and carrying out criticism and self-criticism. The examination started with the leadership and then connected to the examination of individuals. Although some counties, districts, and departments failed to closely integrate with their work during this rectification, they were quickly corrected.

What major problems were solved in this rectification in the district?

Overcoming Blind Complacency. After examining and summarizing work, and calculating accounts in detail, it was affirmed that the district had achieved brilliant results in its work over the past year. First of all, it was manifested in leading the people of the entire district in carrying out the anti-hegemony rent reduction movement, clearing and recovering 58,797 dan of millet (statistics as of the end of May). At the same time, it mobilized and organized the masses to carry out production for self-salvation, allowing 1.1 million disaster victims in the entire district to survive the severe spring famine. Secondly, it mobilized and led the people of the entire district to victoriously complete an unprecedented levee repair project of more than 13.66 million cubic meters. During spring plowing, it also led farmers in dredging ditches, reclaiming wasteland, and intensive cultivation. Subsequently, it led the people of the entire district in fighting drought, controlling insects, and preventing floods and providing disaster relief, ensuring the bumper harvest of more than 5 million mu of land. These achievements would not have been possible without the selfless work of the cadres, especially those in districts and townships who were directly connected with and organized mass actions. However, this was not enough to be proud and complacent. The rectification then used the presentation of situations and the evaluation of good and bad to give cadres a relatively clear understanding of the previous stage of work and their own past work. Before the detailed accounting, many cadres believed that this stage of work was almost done. After the detailed accounting, it was found that the anti-hegemony rent reduction movement was carried out quite roughly, and there were serious impure phenomena in the organization of peasant associations and village governments. In the eighth district of Mianyang County, tenants who had reduced rent accounted for only about 10% of all tenants. In Shahe Township, Jiayu, five baos had more than 70 tenant households, but only more than 20 households reduced rent. In the second district of Mianyang County, there were a total of 105 village heads and deputy village heads in 82 villages, of which 36 had served as puppet soldiers. In total, the first category of villages in the entire special district, where genuine peasants accounted for the majority, averaged about 20%. In better counties such as Mianyang, the first category of villages accounted for about 30% to 40%, and advanced areas were limited to points and the surrounding areas. Only then was the blind complacency of the cadres basically broken, and everyone generally reflected: "This time when we go down, we must work hard."

Improved the policy level and ideological level of cadres. During the rectification, the errors of infringing on the interests of middle peasants in some areas of past work were thoroughly analyzed and criticized. At the beginning, some cadres believed that infringing on middle peasants was wrong according to policy, but middle peasants had a good life and light burdens. In order for poor and hired peasants to survive the disaster, it didn't matter if a few middle peasants were touched. After analyzing the pros and cons and the impact, it was realized that middle peasants were the second largest peasant class in the countryside, second only to poor and hired peasants, and were a peasant class with strong productive forces. Only by uniting middle peasants and actively participating in land reform and rural construction would it benefit poor and hired peasants. The Prefectural Committee's cadre training class also cited the example of "a certain village in the Fenkuai District of Jianli County, because it infringed on the interests of middle peasants, the middle peasants were unwilling to participate in meetings, and special agents took the opportunity to spread rumors saying: 'After dealing with landlords and rich peasants, they deal with middle peasants, and after dealing with middle peasants, they deal with poor peasants,'" causing ideological confusion among the masses to educate everyone. Everyone realized that "infringing on middle peasants is like cutting one's own flesh to heal one's own sores." Secondly, in this rectification, cadres realized that "left" and "right" are both undesirable in work. The erroneous understanding that "'left' means a firm stand, and right means losing the stand" and "hitting bad people is supporting good people" was basically resolved. Ideologically, it was realized that the result of "left" would lead to indiscriminate beating and arrests, causing phenomena that violated policies such as infringing on middle peasants, industry, and commerce, losing social sympathy, and arousing mass dissatisfaction. Cadres participating in the rectification of the financial and economic systems also had a further understanding of the principle of "giving consideration to both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital." In the past, some financial and economic cadres had narrow rural views, blindly hated private industry and commerce, and neglected to unite, help, and take care of the proper development of private industry and commerce. After this rectification, they realized that private industry and commerce had a certain role in the economic construction of a new democratic society. At the same time, the policy of preserving the rich peasant economy in land reform was also studied and discussed in detail, clearing the cadres' resistance thoughts, and everyone realized that "if the rich peasant economy is touched, they will not actively produce, and the middle peasants will also have concerns." "Preserving the rich peasant economy can more firmly unite the middle peasants, neutralize the rich peasants, expand our own strength, further isolate the landlords, and reduce the resistance to land reform."

Establish a democratic style of following the mass line. The summary and examination work reflected that many cadres had commandist styles and illegal and undisciplined phenomena; especially in flood prevention and disaster relief, the situation of beating and tying people was common and serious. Many cadres believed that "without coercion and command, without beating and deducting, the task cannot be completed." In response to these situations, various places presented some specific facts for analysis and criticism. The cadre training class of the CPC Mianyang Prefectural Committee cited the following: When district cadre Li Jianxin began to reduce rent, he did not mobilize the masses, but instead went to landlord Fu Yinshan to ask for rent reduction grain on behalf of the tenants. Fu Yinshan pretended to be poor and resisted rent reduction, so Li Jianxin asked Fu Yinshan to sit in a water prison. As a result, the tenants thought that the landlord was really poor and sympathized with the landlord. The tenants themselves picked out one dan of millet and went out the back door and then in the front door, telling Li Jianxin that it was the rent reduced from the landlord. One night, Li Jianxin ran into Fu Yinshan hiding in the kitchen eating meat, proving that Fu Yinshan was pretending to be poor. The next day, a mass meeting was convened to expose the landlord's conspiracy to pretend to be poor and resist rent reduction. The masses became aware and went to the landlord to reduce rent. The Mianyang enlarged cadre meeting also analyzed that the masses were unwilling to go to the dike for disaster relief because the past levee repair work accounts had not been settled, and the flood prevention burden had not been assigned to households before the flood season. The masses felt it was unfair and dissatisfied. From the examination, everyone realized that coercion and command not only cannot complete the task, but will alienate the masses and cause mass dissatisfaction. Even if sometimes beating and scolding the masses completes the task, it can only be completed in terms of numbers and forms, but politically it will inevitably suffer great losses.

Preliminary strengthening of the unity of worker-peasant cadres and intellectual cadres. The discord between worker-peasant cadres and intellectual cadres was also a very prominent problem discovered in this rectification. The disunity of these two types of cadres reflected the ideological essence of the two types of cadres. After being trained in revolutionary schools, the intellectuals' thinking has been initially transformed. In the early stage of going to the countryside to work, they generally show enthusiasm and enthusiasm, but some hold individualistic goals and regard going to the countryside to work as a personal path to "progress" in order to achieve personal success in the future. Therefore, after a period of work, the petty-bourgeois ideological essence of these people will be exposed, serious individualism, despising workers and peasants, evading difficulties, fearing hardship, demanding to return to the city, demanding to return to the agency for specialization, and unwilling to do mass work, is really "physically in the countryside, but mentally in the city." The main problems of old cadres among worker-peasant cadres are complacency and pride, empiricism, and some degenerate thoughts. The main problems of new cadres from peasant backgrounds are low awareness and family difficulties. Due to the above-mentioned thoughts of worker-peasant and intellectual cadres, a serious phenomenon of disunity has arisen in which they repel and despise each other. After this rectification, criticism and self-criticism were carried out, analyzing that the two types of cadres have their own strengths and weaknesses, and they should learn from each other and learn from each other's strengths to make up for their weaknesses, so that everyone began to have a more correct understanding. For example, at the Mianyang enlarged cadre meeting, intellectual cadres realized that worker-peasant cadres can get closer to the masses and work harder than themselves, and worker-peasant cadres also said: "We have low culture, and we cannot accept new policies as well as intellectuals."

Two Main Experiences

In this rectification, in addition to clearly realizing that rectification must be closely integrated with current work, and that work inspection should first inspect the leadership and then inspect the individual, the district also has two experiences:

(1) Different rectification methods should be adopted for cadres with different political levels. Old cadres and cadres with higher political levels can adopt the rectification method of party congresses and enlarged cadre meetings. After studying documents, examining work, examining leadership, promoting democracy, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism, the political and ideological levels of cadres can be improved a step further. General cadres adopt a rotating training method, using lectures to conduct systematic policy education, and then examining and summarizing work to improve everyone's ideological and political level.

(2) Combine criticism with praise. In rectification, not only should mistakes be criticized, but achievements should be affirmed and successful experiences should be disseminated. Through the comparison of good and bad events, cadres can clearly know what to advocate, what to oppose, and what direction to strive for. The special district paid attention to this issue in this rectification movement. (Correspondent Section of the Hubei Mianyang Prefectural Committee, CPC Feng Yuren)

　　湖北沔阳专区大部干部整风结束
    通过检查主要工作克服了盲目自满情绪
    【本报讯】湖北沔阳专区大部县、区、乡干部已进行了整风学习；乡、村干部、积极分子的训练，亦可于冬季进行土地改革运动（或减租）前全部结束。该专区干部整风，是采取召开整风会议、短期训练班，并与召开区、乡农民代表会相结合的方式进行的。各县第一次扩大干部整风会议于七月底八月初召开，第二次于九月十日前后召开，参加这两次会议的县、区、乡干部共二千三百人。该专署与各县又于八月中、下旬，分别召开财经系统干部整风会议，参加干部共八百七十九人，占现有财经干部的二分之一。这样基本上完成了中共沔阳地委秋前干部整风计划。同时，该专区还举办了干部短期训练班，中共地委已训练了区乡在职干部五百六十六人；各县委已训练村干部、积极分子一千七百六十九人，两项训练人数，合计已占秋前训练干部计划的二分之一。该区训练乡、村干部，在冬初可以全部完成。此外，各县在两次扩大干部会后，普遍召开了区、乡农民代表会，向代表报告检查工作总结，征求意见，改进工作，改进领导。
    该区的这段整风运动基本上执行了毛主席指示的“在和各项工作任务密切地相结合而不是相分离”的方针，通过了检查总结反霸减租、生产救灾与土地改革（或减租）的准备等主要工作，检查政策的执行，检查领导作风，改变了单纯整思想、整缺点的整风方法。同时整风开始，领导上就及时解除了干部思想顾虑，并作检查启发报告，从而发扬民主，开展批评和自我批评。从检查领导而后联系到检查个人。这段整风中，虽然有的县、区，有的部门未能紧密结合工作进行，但很快也纠正了。
    该区这段整风中，主要的解决了那些问题呢？
    克服了盲目自满情绪。经过了检查总结工作，算细账，肯定了该区一年来工作是获得了辉煌成绩的。首先表现在领导全区人民进行了反霸减租运动，清算回果实粮五万八千七百九十七石谷子（五月底的统计），同时发动与组织了群众进行生产自救，使全区一百一十万灾民度过了严重的春荒；其次发动和领导了全区人民胜利的完成了空前的修堤工程一千三百六十六万多公方；在春耕生产时又领导农民疏沟、开荒、精耕细作，继而又领导全区人民抗旱、治虫、防汛抢险，保证了五百余万亩田的丰收。这些成绩没有干部、尤其没有直接联系和组织群众行动的区乡干部的忘我工作，将是不可能获得的。然而这并不足以骄傲自满。整风继而用摆情况，评好坏，使干部对上段工作和自己过去的工作，有了比较明确的认识。未经算细账前，不少干部认为这段工作搞的差不多了；经过算细账，发现反霸减租运动进行得相当粗糙，农协会及村政权的组织存在着严重的不纯现象。沔阳县八区已减过租的佃户，仅占所有佃户百分之十左右，嘉鱼沙河乡五保有七十多户佃户，只有二十多户减了租。沔阳县二区八十二个村，共有正副村长一○五名，其中有三十六名当过伪军的。总计全专区，真正农民占优势的第一类村庄，平均约占百分之二十，沔阳等较好的县份第一类村庄约占百分之三十到四十；并且先进地区还限于点及点的周围。这才基本上打破了干部的盲目自满情绪，大家普遍反映：“这回下去可得好好工作了。”
    提高了干部政策水平与思想水平。整风中，比较彻底的分析批判了过去工作中某些地方侵犯中农利益的错误。开始有些干部认为侵犯中农，按政策说是不对的，但是中农生活好，负担轻，为了贫雇农度过灾荒，动个把中农没有关系。经过分析利害和影响，认识到中农在农村中的人口仅次于贫雇农，是一个生产力较强的农民阶层，只有团结中农积极参加土地改革工作与农村建设，才会对贫雇农有好处。地委干训班并举出：“监利县分块区某村因侵犯了中农利益，中农便不愿参加开会，特务就乘机造谣说：‘搞了地富搞中农，搞了中农搞贫农。’”引起了群众思想混乱的例子教育大家。大家体会了“侵犯中农就等于割自己的肉，补自己的疮。”再次，在这次整风中，干部认识到工作中“左”与“右”都要不得。“‘左’是立场稳，右是失掉立场”、“打坏人是替好人撑腰”等错误认识基本上得到了解决；在思想上认识了“左”的结果会造成乱打乱捕，造成了侵犯中农、工商业等违犯政策的现象，会失掉社会同情和引起群众不满。参加财经系统整风的干部，对“公私兼顾，劳资两利”的方针也有了进一步的认识。过去有些财经干部，存在着狭隘的农村观点、盲目的仇视私营工商业，忽视了团结、帮助和照顾私营工商业的正当发展。经过这次整风，才了解私营工商业在新民主主义社会经济建设中，有其一定的作用。同时对土地改革中，保存富农经济政策问题也做了详细研究讨论，打通了干部的抵抗思想，大家认识到“动了富农经济，他们就不积极生产，中农也有了顾虑。”“保存富农经济可以更巩固地团结中农，中立富农，扩大了自己的力量，更加孤立地主，减少了土地改革的阻力。”
    树立起走群众路线的民主作风。从总结检查工作中，反映出不少干部有着命令主义作风和违法乱纪的现象；尤其在防汛抢险中，打人捆人情形是普遍而严重的。有很多干部认为：“不强迫命令，不打不扣，不能完成任务。”针对这些情况，各地都摆出了一些具体事实，进行分析批判。中共沔阳地委干训班举出：区干部李建新在开始进行减租时，不发动群众，自己代替佃户向地主傅银山要减租粮，傅银山装穷抵抗减租，李建新就叫傅银山坐水牢。结果佃户以为地主真穷，同情地主，佃户自己挑出一石谷子从后门出去，再从前门进来，对李建新说是减的地主的租子。有一天晚上，李建新碰到傅银山躲在厨房吃肉，证明了傅银山是装穷。第二天就召开群众大会，揭露了地主装穷违抗减租的阴谋。群众觉悟了，纷纷向地主进行减租。沔阳扩大干部会也分析出：抢险时群众不愿上堤，是因为过去的修堤工账没算清，汛前又没将防汛负担派到户，群众感到不公平，不满意。从检查中，大家才认识到强迫命令不但不能完成任务，反会脱离群众，引起群众不满，即使有时打骂群众完成了任务，但至多只能从数字上、形式上完成，而在政治上却必然受到很大的损失。
    初步加强了工农干部与知识分子干部的团结。工农干部与知识分子干部闹不团结，也是这次整风中发现的一个很突出的问题。这两种干部的不团结，反映了两种干部的思想本质。知识分子在经过革命学校训练后，其思想得到初步改造，下乡工作初期，一般表现积极、热情，但有些是抱着个人主义的目的，把下乡锻炼当成个人“进步”之路，以便日后达到个人出人头地；因之，在经过一段工作后，这部分人的小资产阶级思想本质就会暴露出来，严重的个人主义思想，轻视工农，逃避困难，惧怕艰苦，要求回城，要求回机关专业化，不愿做群众工作，真是“身在农村，心在城市”。工农干部中老干部的主要问题是居功自骄，经验主义和一部分蜕化思想；农民出身的新干部的主要问题是觉悟低，家庭有困难。由于工农与知识分子干部存在上述的思想，产生了互相排斥、互相轻视的严重不团结现象。经过这次整风，展开批评和自我批评，分析了两种干部各有所长，也各有所短，应该互相学习，取长补短，才使大家开始有了比较正确的认识。例如沔阳扩大干部会上，知识分子干部认识到工农干部比自己能接近群众与工作艰苦，工农干部也说：“我们文化低，接受新的政策不如知识分子。”
    两点主要经验
    该区在这段整风中除明确体会到：整风必须与当前工作密切相结合；检查工作先检查领导后检查个人外，还有两点经验：
    （一）各种不同政治水平的干部，应采取不同的整风方式。老干部及政治水平较高的干部，可以采取党代会及扩大干部会的整风方式进行，经过学习文件，检查工作，检查领导，发扬民主，开展批评与自我批评，就可以把干部的政治水平思想水平提高一步。一般干部采取轮训方式，用讲课的方式进行系统的政策教育，进而检查总结工作，以提高大家的思想、政治水平。
    （二）批评与表扬相结合。整风中不仅应批判错误，而且应肯定成绩，传播成功的经验，通过好坏事件的对比，使干部明显的知道提倡什么，反对什么，应该努力的方向是什么。该专区在这段整风运动中，就注意了这个问题。（湖北沔阳地委通讯科  酆于仁）
