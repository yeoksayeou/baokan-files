　　Great Achievements on the Agricultural Production Front in the Past Year
    1950 was the first year that the Chinese people, after winning the war, began to carry out economic construction in a planned way. In the past year, the tremendous recovery and development carried out on the national agricultural production front under the leadership of the People's Government has achieved great results. In the past year, agriculture achieved bumper harvests in the spring and summer seasons, and the production of grain and cotton greatly exceeded the original plan. This year, the country can produce 240 billion catties of raw grain, an increase of 9 percent, or 10 billion catties, compared with last year, which can already achieve self-sufficiency; cotton can produce 14 million dan (In the draft "Most Cotton Fields in the Country Report a Bumper Harvest" issued on the 20th, it was mistakenly written as about 15 million dan). This is an increase of 60 percent, or 5.2 million dan of raw cotton, compared with last year. The production of other industrial raw materials and export goods has also largely completed the plan. Bast fiber crops can produce more than 4.5 million dan, silkworm cocoons can produce 650,000 dan of fresh cocoons, and tea can produce more than 1.2 million dan.

    Reversing the Twelve-Year Trend, the Level of Agricultural Production Gradually Rises.

    During the twelve years of war from the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan until last year, the national level of agricultural production declined by about a quarter, and even a third in some areas, due to the plunder, destruction and devastation by the Japanese puppets and the Kuomintang reactionaries; Although the old liberated areas had recovered their agricultural production to a certain extent through several years of production campaigns, they were still about 15 percent lower than the pre-war level by last year. In the first year after the establishment of the Central People's Government, the national agricultural production reversed the downward trend of the past twelve years and progressed towards an upward path. This year's grain production has recovered to 85.7 percent of the pre-war level; cotton production has reached 82.8 percent of the pre-war level. This is a very significant shift.

    In completing this year's grain and cotton production increase plan, the People's Government and the national farmers carried out many arduous organizational tasks. The most important thing is that farmers in various regions have organized labor mutual assistance under the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, thereby improving production efficiency. Farmers in the old areas have generally organized small labor mutual assistance groups on the basis of past production. Labor mutual assistance organizations in the new areas have also developed under the advocacy of the People's Government; labor mutual assistance has become an important lever for production development.

    In terms of cultivation and fertilization, most old areas have approached or reached the pre-war level. In Northeast China, it is generally done with three plows and three cultivations. In the old areas of North China, it is generally done with three plows and three harrows, and the intertillage in many areas has increased by one time compared with last year. East China, Central South China, and Northwest China have generally maintained last year's cultivation level, and some areas have slightly exceeded it. In terms of increasing fertilization, most old areas have increased the amount of fertilizer applied by 10 percent compared with last year, and new areas have generally maintained last year's level. In addition, this year, various regions have also reclaimed more than 12 million mu of wasteland, expanding the cultivated area.

    Construction of Water Conservancy Projects Benefits More Than 6 Million Mu.

    Various regions have also made tremendous achievements in improving the basic conditions for agricultural production. This year, various regions have built and repaired many large and small farmland water conservancy projects, benefiting a total area of ​​more than 6.4 million mu. Among them, there are more than 60 large-scale irrigation projects invested by the state, such as the Sanggan River silt irrigation project, benefiting an area of ​​about 2 million mu; People's governments organized and assisted farmers in building more than 12,000 small canals, 71,000 small ponds, dams, gates, and weirs; dug wells and repaired 68,000 old wells; People's governments also lent 73,000 waterwheels. This year, farmers in various regions have also generally increased the repair of agricultural tools. In the five provinces of North China, a total of more than 14.3 million pieces of agricultural tools of various sizes have been repaired. At the same time, the work of promoting new agricultural tools in various regions has also achieved certain results.

    In agricultural science and technology, in the past year, various regions have focused on preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests and promoting improved varieties. This year, locusts were found in 117 counties in Xinjiang, Henan and other provinces. After the People's Government led 1.75 million farmers to capture and kill them, the locusts were promptly eliminated and did not cause disasters. Farmers in Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang and other provinces have launched a large-scale rice borer catching campaign. In Zhejiang, Fujian, and southern Jiangsu alone, more than 10 million pieces of rice borer eggs and 390 million rice borer moths were captured. In order to strengthen the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and the agricultural departments of major administrative regions have successively established 47 disease and insect pest prevention and control stations in various regions, and lent more than 2.3 million catties of various insecticides, which can be used to prevent and control insect pests on more than 19 million mu of land. In addition, 27 million mu of seeds were subjected to warm soup soaking and wine mixing, medicine mixing and other disease prevention and disinfection work. Under the goal of generally replacing the seeds of the country's main crops with improved varieties within five years, the people's governments in various regions have promoted a total of more than 4.6 million mu of improved varieties of food grains this year (excluding the Northeast), and the improved varieties of cotton have been expanded to more than 10 million mu, and in the summer and autumn seasons, farmers were vigorously mobilized to widely carry out seed selection campaigns.

    In terms of animal power, in order to protect draft animals, in addition to strictly prohibiting slaughter, this year the country has prevented and controlled rinderpest and anthrax in more than 6 million cattle (accounting for about 21 percent of the country's yellow cattle). In the spring, anthrax in 32 counties in Henan Province and rinderpest in more than 20 counties in Gansu Province were successively eradicated. Chabei, where rinderpest has been rampant for years, has not recurred this year after prevention and control. In order to improve livestock breeds and promote reproduction, various regions have selected good folk livestock to organize breeding stations. The Northeast region has selected more than 27,000 head of good breeding livestock, and Shandong, Pingyuan and Northwest regions have established more than 850 breeding stations.

    The People's Liberation Army Enters Agricultural Production, Cultivating More Than 3.3 Million Mu of Farmland.

    On the agricultural production front, in addition to the large army of farmers, there is also the production army of the People's Liberation Army. After the basic end of the war on the mainland, they immediately enthusiastically took on the task of agricultural production, participated in national water conservancy and other construction projects, and cultivated more than 3.3 million mu of farmland, making a significant contribution to the country's economic construction.

    The above achievements, in addition to the fact that the weather has been favorable throughout the country this year and no serious and widespread disasters have occurred, are mainly due to the following reasons:

    First of all, the war has basically ended on the mainland, and war service has been lifted in most areas. The destruction and disruption of production by the enemy for many years has been basically eliminated (a small number of areas are still harassed by bandits), and farmers can concentrate all their efforts on carrying out production in a timely manner in a stable environment, with favorable conditions for implementing deep plowing and meticulous cultivation.

    Secondly, and more importantly, the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, the people's governments at all levels, and the Communist Party of China committees at all levels is the decisive factor in achieving victory on the agricultural front this year. The Central People's Government formulated and implemented various policies to reward production and support farmers' production. The Central People's Government and the CPC Central Committee unanimously emphasized the importance of leading production and criticized various ideas and actions that hinder production. In order to reward increased production, the Central People's Government formulated a tax policy that exempts the portion of the harvest increased due to diligent cultivation from taxation; in order to encourage farmers to actively plant industrial raw material crops and effectively protect their interests, the Central People's Government promptly stipulated reasonable parity prices for cotton and grain and hemp and grain, and the national trade departments carried out pre-purchase and purchase work in a planned manner; in order to carry out agricultural construction with emphasis and assist poor farmers in production, this year the People's Government allocated a total of 1.4 billion catties of grain as investment and loans. In the newly liberated areas, the People's Government implemented the rent reduction policy and implemented the principle of who sows, who harvests; the People's Liberation Army concentrated its efforts on suppressing bandits and stabilizing social order. In the new areas that were liberated earlier, the People's Government also led farmers to implement land reform and liberate agricultural productive forces. In flood-stricken areas, the method of providing work as a form of relief was adopted, and flood control projects were launched, which played a significant role in overcoming disasters, preventing floods, and ensuring this year's bumper harvest.

    In completing this year's agricultural production increase plan, labor models, production activists, and outstanding Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members in rural areas played a leading and backbone role. The facts of the past year have proved that wherever labor models or Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members actively take the lead, unite and help farmers carry out production, significant achievements have been made.

    The achievements made in agricultural production this year are a good start for restoring and developing the country's agriculture, but there are still many shortcomings in the work, and any degree of complacency is harmful. In order to strive to restore and exceed the pre-war production level of grain, industrial raw materials and export goods in a short period of time and obtain continuous bumper harvests, even greater and more arduous efforts are needed.

### 一年来农业生产战线上的伟大成绩

　　一年来农业生产战线上的伟大成绩
    一九五○年是中国人民赢得战争胜利后开始有计划地进行经济建设的第一年。一年来，在人民政府的领导下，全国的农业生产战线上所进行的巨大的恢复和发展，已获得伟大的成绩。一年来农业战线上春、夏两季丰收，粮棉的生产大大超过了原定计划。今年全国可产原粮二千四百亿斤，较去年增产粮食百分之九，即一百亿斤，已能自给；棉花可产一千四百万担（二十日所发《全国大部棉田皆告丰收》稿中，误为一千五百万担左右）。较去年增产皮棉百分之六十，即五百二十余万担。其他工业原料和外销物资的生产，也大部完成计划，麻类作物可产四百五十余万担，蚕丝可产鲜茧六十五万担，茶叶可产一百二十余万担。
    扭转十二年趋势，农业生产水平逐步上升。
    从抗日战争开始到去年止的十二年战争期间，由于日伪和国民党反动派的掠夺破坏与摧残，全国的农业生产水平曾下降了四分之一左右，某些地区甚至下降了三分之一；老解放区虽然经过了几年来的生产运动，使农业生产有了一定程度的恢复，但至去年止仍较战前的水平降低百分之十五左右。在中央人民政府成立后的第一年，全国农业生产就扭转了这十二年来下降的趋势，而向着上升的道路进展了。今年粮食生产，已恢复到战前的百分之八十五点七；棉花产量已达到战前的百分之八十二点八。这是一个非常重大的转变。
    在完成今年的粮棉增产计划中，人民政府和全国农民曾进行了许多艰巨的组织工作。最重要的是各地农民在自愿互利的原则下组织了劳动互助，从而提高了生产效率。老区农民在过去的生产基础上，普遍地组织了小型劳动互助组。新区的劳动互助组织，在人民政府的提倡下也有了发展；劳动互助已成为生产发展的重要杠杆。
    在耕作和施肥上，大部老区已接近或达到战前的水平。东北各地一般已作到耕三次和中耕三次。华北老区一般作到三耕三耙，其中不少地区的中耕都较去年增加一次。华东、中南、西北各地一般都维持了去年的耕作水平，部分地区略有超过。在增施肥料上，大部分老区的施肥量都较去年增加百分之十，新区一般保持了去年的水平。此外，今年各地还开垦荒地一千二百余万亩，扩大了耕地面积。
    修建水利工程，受益六百余万亩。
    各地在改善农业生产的基本条件上，也有着巨大的成就。今年各地新建和修复许多大小农田水利工程，受益面积共达六百四十余万亩，其中国家投资举办的较大灌溉工程有桑干河淤灌工程等六十余处，受益面积约二百万亩；人民政府组织和扶助农民群众修建的小型渠道一万二千余处，小型塘、坝、闸、堰等七万一千处；打井和修复旧井六万八千余眼；人民政府并出贷水车七万三千余辆。今年各地农民也普遍地进行增修农具，华北五省计共增修了大小农具一千四百三十余万件。同时，各地推广新式农具的工作，也获得了一定的成绩。
    在农业科学技术上，一年来各地着重于防治病虫害和推广优良品种。今年新疆、河南等省曾有一百一十七县发现了蝗虫，经人民政府领导一百七十五万农民进行捕打后，即及时将蝗虫消灭，未使成灾。江西、福建、浙江等省农民曾展开了大规模的捕螟运动，仅浙江、福建、苏南等地即采螟卵一千余万块，捕螟蛾三亿九千余只。为了加强病虫害防治工作，中央人民政府农业部和各大行政区农业部门又先后在各地成立了四十七个病虫害防治站，贷放了各种杀虫药二百三十余万斤，可供防治一千九百余万亩虫害之用。另有二千七百万亩的种子，进行了温汤浸种和酒拌、药拌等防病消毒工作。在五年内使全国主要作物的种子普遍换成优良品种的目标下，各地人民政府今年共推广良种食粮四百六十余万亩（不包括东北），良种棉花扩展至一千余万亩，并在夏秋两季大力发动农民群众普遍开展了选种运动。
    在畜力方面，为了保护耕畜，各地人民政府除严禁屠宰外，今年全国共防治牛瘟和牛炭疽六百余万头（约占全国黄牛的百分之二十一），春季时河南省三十二个县的炭疽和甘肃二十余个县的牛瘟，都相继被扑灭。历年牛瘟猖獗的察北，经防治后今年也未复发。为了改良畜种促进繁殖，各地多选出民间良畜组织配种站。东北区已选出好种畜二万七千余头，山东、平原和西北区已设立了配种站八百五十余处。
    解放军投入农业生产，垦植三百余万亩农田。
    在农业生产战线上，除农民生产大军之外，还有人民解放军的生产大军。他们在大陆战争基本结束之后，便立即踊跃地担负起农业生产的任务，参加了国家的水利等建设工程，并开垦种植了三百三十余万亩农田，对国家的经济建设作了重大的贡献。
    以上成绩的获得，除了全国各地今年风调雨顺，没有发生严重的普遍性的灾害之外，主要是由于以下的原因：
    首先是战争已在大陆上基本结束，战争勤务在绝大部分地区已经解除，多年来敌人对生产的破坏和扰乱已基本上消除（少数地区尚有土匪骚扰），农民可以集中全力在安定的环境中及时地进行生产，具备了实行深耕细作的有利条件。
    其次，更重要的是毛主席、中央人民政府、各级人民政府以及中国共产党各级党委的正确领导，这是今年在农业战线上获得胜利的决定因素。中央人民政府制定并贯彻了奖励生产和扶助农民生产的各项政策。中央人民政府和中共中央一致强调了领导生产的重要性，批判了各种妨碍生产的思想和行动。中央人民政府为着奖励增产，制定了由于勤劳耕作而增加的收获部分不予征税的税收政策；为着鼓励农民积极地种植工业原料作物并切实保障其利益，中央人民政府及时地规定了棉粮、麻粮的合理比价，国家贸易部门并有计划地进行了预购和收买工作；为着有重点地进行农业建设和扶助贫苦农民进行生产，今年人民政府共拨付十四亿斤粮食作为投资和贷款。在新解放区，人民政府实行了减租政策，并贯彻谁种谁收的原则；人民解放军又集中力量剿灭土匪，安定社会秩序。在解放较早的新区人民政府又领导农民实行土地改革，解放农业生产力。在水灾地区，则采取了以工代赈的办法，举办了防洪工程，这对战胜灾荒，防止水患，保证今年的丰收，起了重大的作用。
    在完成今年的农业增产计划中，劳动模范、生产积极分子和农村中优秀的共产党员、青年团团员发挥了带头作用和骨干作用。一年来的事实证明，凡是劳动模范或中共党员和青年团员积极带头，团结和帮助农民进行生产的地方，就获得显著成绩。
    今年农业生产上获得的成绩，是恢复和发展国家农业的良好开端，但在工作中还存在着许多缺点，任何程度的自满都是有害的，为了争取于短期间内恢复并超过战前粮食、工业原料和外销物资的生产水平，获得连年丰收，还有待更大的更艰苦的努力。
