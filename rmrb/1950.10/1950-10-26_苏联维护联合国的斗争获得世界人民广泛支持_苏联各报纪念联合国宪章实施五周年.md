Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 25th: TASS reports from Moscow: On October 24th, Soviet newspapers all published articles commemorating the fifth anniversary of the implementation of the United Nations Charter.

　　The newspaper Izvestia published an article by Mikhailov entitled "Against the Subversion and Destruction of the United Nations," stating: "Since the establishment of the United Nations five years ago, each General Assembly has marked the initiative of the Soviet government to strive for the lofty goals expounded in Article 1 of the United Nations Charter. Faithful to its Stalinist foreign policy, the Soviet Union has annually raised issues of deep concern to the vast majority of mankind in the United Nations—the consolidation of peace and the cessation of new war threats. The proposals put forward by the Soviet government in the United Nations have received extremely broad support from the people of all countries and have played a huge role in uniting the army of hundreds of millions of peace fighters; the voices of these peace fighters are growing louder, and their determination to defend the cause of peace is growing stronger."

　　Mikhailov wrote: "The people of the world know that the Soviet Union's struggle for peace is also a struggle to safeguard the United Nations as an instrument for peace and security, and a struggle against the Anglo-American bloc's transformation of the United Nations into a tool for them to prepare for a new war and achieve world hegemony."

　　Mikhailov concluded: "Anglo-American imperialists want to use the banner of the United Nations to cover up their plundering actions. The instigators of a new war are trying to abolish the principle of unanimity among the great powers, thereby depriving the Security Council of its powers under the Charter as the body primarily responsible for maintaining peace. The tycoons of Wall Street hope that the fate of the United Nations and the fate of the world will be decided by their 'majority in their pockets,' and not by the Security Council and its permanent members."

　　The Labor Daily published an article by Isakov, who wrote: "The financial diplomats are trying to undermine the United Nations machinery, but they dare not openly carry out this criminal work. Indeed, they cannot say to everyone, let everyone hear: they want to abolish the United Nations established by the anti-Hitler peoples. The aggressors have to adopt hesitant and roundabout tactics."

　　The New York dispatches by Rasadin and Filippov, published in the Pravda, pointed out: "If the United Nations has played some positive role in the five years since its establishment, it is primarily due to the support of the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union has done everything possible to safeguard the United Nations Charter and prevent the United Nations from being destroyed by the enemies of peace. The Soviet Union's proposal at the current Fifth General Assembly for a declaration to stop the threat of a new war and consolidate world peace and security is an effective way to strengthen peace and friendship among the people of all countries. However, the United States is pursuing a policy of undermining the United Nations, and the American proposal, hypocritically called 'United Action for Peace,' is an attempt to paralyze the Security Council, the main body of the United Nations, and is a mine buried under the foundation of the United Nations. However, the commanding policy pursued by the ruling groups in the United States has been resolutely countered by the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries in the United Nations General Assembly. Some countries in Asia and the Near East want to get rid of the influence of aggressive forces and promote the cause of international cooperation; although this desire is still somewhat timid and not firm, it has been revealed in this General Assembly."

　　Rasadin and Filippov concluded: "Two paths lie before the United Nations: one is the path of promoting peace pointed out by the Soviet Union, and the other is the path of serving the aggressors. The people of the whole world are watching intently to see which one the United Nations will choose."

　　苏联维护联合国的斗争获得世界人民广泛支持
    苏联各报纪念联合国宪章实施五周年
    【新华社二十五日讯】综合塔斯社莫斯科讯：十月二十四日，苏联各报都刊载纪念联合国宪章实施五周年的文章。
    消息报刊载米哈依洛夫所作“反对颠覆和毁灭联合国”一文称：联合国成立五周年以来，每一届大会都标志着苏联政府争取实现联合国宪章第一条所阐述的崇高目标的主动性。苏联忠实于它的斯大林外交政策，每年都对联合国提出为绝大多数人类所深切关怀的问题—巩固和平与制止新战争威胁问题。苏联政府在联合国中提出的提案曾受到一切国家的人民群众的极其广泛的支持，并且在团结亿万和平斗士大军上起了巨大的作用；这些和平斗士的呼声日益宏大，他们的保卫和平事业的决心日益坚强。
    米哈依洛夫写道：全世界人民知道：苏联争取和平的斗争同时也就是维护联合国为和平与安全的工具的斗争，也就是反对美英集团变联合国为其准备新战争取得世界霸权的工具的斗争。
    米哈依洛夫最后写道：美英帝国主义者们想要用联合国的旗帜来掩盖他们的抢劫行动。新战争的挑拨者竭力要取消大国一致原则，借以剥夺安全理事会根据宪章作为担负维护和平的主要责任的机构所具有的职权。华尔街的大亨们希望联合国的命运和世界的命运由他们的“荷包中的大多数”决定，而不由安全理事会及其常任理事国决定。
    劳动报刊载伊萨可夫的一篇文章，他写道：金元外交家们力图破坏联合国机器，但是他们不敢公开地进行这种犯罪的工作。诚然，他们不可能对每一个人说，让每一个人都听到：他们想要取消反希特勒的人民所建立的那个联合国。侵略者们只得踌躇不决地采取迂回的策略。
    真理报刊载的拉萨丁和费利波夫的纽约通讯指出：如果说联合国成立五年以来起了某种积极作用的话，这首先是由于苏联的支持，因为苏联尽了一切可能的方法来维护联合国宪章，使联合国不为和平之敌所破坏。苏联在目前第五届大会所提出的制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全宣言提案，就是加强和平与各国人民间友谊的有效方法。但是美国执行破坏联合国的政策，虚伪地叫做“保障和平的联合行动”的美国提案，就是企图瘫痪联合国的主要机构安全理事会，就是埋在联合国基础下的一枚地雷。不过美国统治集团所执行的发号施令的政策在联合国大会上受到了苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的坚决反击。亚洲和近东的某些国家想要摆脱侵略势力的影响，促进国际合作事业，它们这种愿望虽然还有些胆怯，不坚决，但是已在本届大会中发现出来了。
    拉萨丁和费利波夫最后指出：联合国面前摆着两条道路：一条是苏联所指明的促进和平的道路，另一条是为侵略者效力的道路。全世界人民都聚精会神地在注视着联合国究竟选择那一条。
