Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 6th: The Preparatory Committee for the Second World Peace Congress, convened in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, has issued a statement stating: The Preparatory Committee has listened to reports from delegations from various countries, which fully demonstrate that peace advocates in all countries are enthusiastically responding to the call issued by the Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress to convene the Second World Peace Congress, and have launched widespread movements in support of this call.

The statement points out: Peace cannot be forced by military means. The realization of peace can only rely on the peaceful coexistence of various different systems in the world, and the peaceful competition between people of different beliefs in various countries. At a time when some are clamoring for war, the free exchange of opinions between people with different ideas and people who support various social systems is a necessary prerequisite for establishing genuine peace. Therefore, the main task of the Preparatory Committee is to ensure that all kind people, regardless of their political beliefs, as long as they advocate peace, can send representatives to participate in the Second World Peace Congress.

The statement further emphasizes: The Preparatory Committee can say with complete certainty that the free people of the world, by supporting the Stockholm Appeal, have forced the governments of many countries to expose their plans and dare not use atomic bombs. The unity of hundreds of millions of people around the world can achieve even greater successes.

The statement concludes: Since the call to convene the Second World Peace Congress was issued, the issues that have been discussed in various countries are: prohibiting weapons of mass destruction, ending the arms race and gradually controlling disarmament, investigating facts and condemning aggression, prohibiting war propaganda, adhering to the United Nations Charter, ensuring the people's right to decide their own destiny, peacefully resolving war conflicts, and restoring normal economic and cultural exchanges. All those who are concerned about these tasks can participate in the Second World Peace Congress. This congress will be a grand gathering of people of all nationalities to defend their most precious possession - peace.

　　第二届世界和大筹委会发表声明
    各国和平拥护者支持召开和大关心和平人民均可派代表参加
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社布拉格六日讯：在捷克斯洛伐克京城布拉格召开的第二届世界拥护和平大会筹备委员会顷发表声明称：筹备委员会听取了各国代表团的报告，这些报告充分表明：各国和平拥护者都热烈响应世界和大常设委员会执行局所发出的召开第二届世界拥护和平大会的号召，并已广泛地展开了支持这个号召的运动。
    声明指出：和平是不能以武力强求的。和平的实现只能有赖于世界上各种不同制度的和平共存，及各国信仰不同的人民间的和平竞赛。正当有人叫嚣战争的时候，思想不同的人民和拥护各种社会制度的人民之间的自由交换意见，是建立真正和平的必要前提条件。因此，筹备委员会的主要任务在于确保一切善良的人民，不问其政治信仰如何，只要拥护和平，均可派代表参加第二届世界拥护和平大会。
    声明进而强调称：筹备委员会可以完全肯定地说：全世界的自由人民由于拥护斯德哥尔摩宣言，已迫使许多国家的政府泄露了它们的计划，并且不敢使用原子弹。全世界亿万人民的团结还可以取得更大的成绩。
    声明结语称：召开第二届世界拥护和平大会的号召发出后，已在各国展开讨论的问题是：禁止大规模毁灭人类的武器，结束军备竞赛并逐步管制裁军，调查事实并谴责侵略，禁止战争宣传，遵守联合国宪章，确保人民有决定自己命运的权利，和平解决战争冲突，恢复经济与文化上的正常交流。凡对这些任务表示关心的人，都可参加第二届世界拥护和平大会。这次大会将是各族人民保卫他们最宝贵的财产——和平的盛大集会。
