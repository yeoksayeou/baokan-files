    Secretly Hiding Guns, Plotting to Organize Armed Rebellion
    Local Tyrant Wu Jiwu of Mengcheng Executed
    [Report from this newspaper] The Mengcheng County People's Government in northern Anhui resolutely suppressed Wu Jiwu, a local tyrant and landlord who secretly hid guns and plotted to launch an armed rebellion. The criminal was executed on September 30th at a public trial attended by over ten thousand people. The criminal was from Dongji, Wangting District, Mengcheng County, and owned more than 400 *qing* of land, spanning the three counties of Mengcheng, Guoyang, and Fengtai. The criminal had consistently colluded with the reactionary government, opposing communism and the people. While serving as the county magistrate of the puppet Taihe County, the criminal extorted more than 10,000 *jin* of wheat and 4,000 silver coins, and fostered dozens of bandits and lackeys such as Xu Yuzhu and Lü Zhendong, who engaged in arson, murder, looting, and shared the spoils. He was responsible for the deaths of 53 people. In 1948, when the Liu-Deng army moved south and liberated the Dongji area, they opened Wu's granary to provide relief to the poor. After our army withdrew to the north, he immediately instructed his henchmen, Xu Yuzhu and others, to kill the poor peasant couple Wang Jinsheng under the pretext of "collaborating with the Eighth Route Army." Wu Shaoping, the criminal's brother, under his protection, ran rampant and raped 63 women, causing deep resentment among the masses. After liberation, the criminal not only did not repent but also secretly hid 28 rifles and pistols in the Bengbu area, preparing to organize reactionary armed forces to resist the People's Government. Last autumn, after the People's Government arrested the criminal, the masses rose up to denounce him and demanded severe punishment. The County People's Government, based on the demands of the masses and with the approval of the Anhui North Administrative Office, sentenced the criminal to death. When the chairman of the public trial announced the verdict, it immediately aroused enthusiastic applause from the attendees. Everyone said, "Without the Communist Party, who could have eliminated this old source of trouble that has weighed on the people for decades!"
