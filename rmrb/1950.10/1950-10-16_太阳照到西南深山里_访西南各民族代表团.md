　　The Sun Shines into the Deep Mountains of Southwest China
    ——Visiting the Southwest Ethnic Minorities Delegation
    Bai Sheng
    Nineteen ethnic groups from the remote southwestern mountainous areas—the Tibetan people from Xikang, Yunnan, and western Sichuan; the Miao people from Guizhou; the Hui people from Yunnan and Guizhou; the Yi people from Xikang; the Dai and Bo people from Yunnan; the Zhongjia people from Guizhou; the Minjia, Moshe, Axi, Sani, Aili, Lisu, Nu, Puman, Kawa, Aka, and Luohei people from Yunnan; as well as Han people from areas with concentrated ethnic minority populations—sent sixty-five representatives and seventy-three members of their cultural troupe to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations. They brought the freedom and joy felt by the southwestern ethnic brothers in this big family of national unity to Chairman Mao. They brought their most beloved gifts, the costumes of their ethnic groups and valuable treasures, to present to Chairman Mao. Their enthusiastic and simple songs and dances were performed in Beijing and were warmly welcomed by the people of Beijing.
    In the Western Suburbs Park of Beijing, in a magnificent antique room once inhabited by emperors and empresses of the Qing Dynasty, I met these representatives of ethnic brothers who had traveled from the deep mountains of Southwest China.
    Introduced by the head of the delegation, Wang Weizhou, I interviewed several representatives from different ethnic groups.
    Tibetan People Eagerly Awaiting to See Chairman Mao
    Bangda Duoji, the Tibetan representative from Xikang—the deputy head of the delegation and the current deputy director of the Kangding Military Control Commission—and Awang Jiacuo, a lama from Ganzi, Xikang, excitedly described the Tibetan people's love for Chairman Mao and the People's Liberation Army. They felt proud that the Chinese people of all ethnic groups had such a brilliant leader as Chairman Mao. In April of this year, after the Tibetan people of Xikang had waited day and night, the People's Liberation Army finally liberated Xikang. This army, which had passed through the grasslands and wilderness of Xikang more than ten years ago during the Long March, has come again today bringing happiness to the people. The Communist Party's great ethnic policies and the PLA's iron discipline and hard work deeply moved the Tibetan people of Xikang. The Tibetan people enthusiastically support the Communist Party and the People's Government.
    Recalling the past when the Tibetan people of Xikang were divided and suffered for a long time under the rule of the Kuomintang's Han chauvinism, Bangda Duoji said with emotion: We will never forget our hatred for the reactionaries. We were discriminated against and oppressed so much that we could not stand up. But today, the Communist Party has liberated us. We have come to Beijing with glory and have seen Chairman Mao. We really feel like children who have been separated from their parents for a long time and have finally seen their beloved parents. I will definitely tell our Tibetan brothers about the great scene of the people's strength that I saw in the people's capital.
    The Miao People Have Emerged
    Li Ruyun, a Miao representative from Guizhou, warmly expressed the gratitude of the more than two million Miao people in Guizhou to Chairman Mao. This deputy head of the Southwest Ethnic Minorities Delegation is the deputy secretary-general of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of Guizhou Province. He vividly described the story of the Miao people's liberation.
    He said: The area along the Qingshui River in eastern Guizhou is where most of the Miao people live. Seventy percent of the Miao people there are poor peasants and farm laborers. In the past, due to the exploitation and oppression of the reactionary rule, in order to pay the rent, we had a saying: "Even grabbing a handful of mud to hit a crow belongs to the boss (landlord)." Every year, for two to four months, the Miao people had no food to eat, and often no salt to eat either. Because of poverty, people and livestock lived in the same house, so diseases often plagued our suffering Miao people. What the Miao people hated most was that the Kuomintang reactionaries oppressed us with Han chauvinism and incited disunity, making it even harder for us to stand up. There is a song that describes the fate of our suffering Miao people:
        The sun sets red!
        The moon comes out yellow!
        The Miao people want to emerge,
        To get rid of suffering and sorrow,
        It's like the moon chasing the sun!
        We can't catch up in a lifetime!
    But today, the sun has shone into the deep mountains of the southwest. We, the Miao people who have always been looked down upon, have raised our heads. We have been warmed by the sun—Chairman Mao.
    We have been liberated and our political status has been raised. In the people's government and the people's representative conferences, we have representatives of the Miao people participating. We can speak our own ethnic language, wear our own ethnic costumes, and speak proudly in the people's conference hall. We will never be discriminated against again. Every Miao person deeply appreciates Chairman Mao. Don't you hear? Aren't the several Miao girls in our cultural troupe singing vividly "Missing Chairman Mao"? Their songs describe how Chairman Mao passed through our Miao area during the Long March, writing words at the edge of the village to awaken us Miao people. After Chairman Mao left, the Miao people missed him day and night until liberation. Listen:
    …………………
    We waited and waited,
    Waited for fourteen years,
    The fifteenth year arrived,
    Our father—our savior—arrived.
    Came to call us to rise,
    So we gathered together,
    And followed our Chairman Mao.

    We have food to eat and clothes to wear,
    And have become chubby and fat,
    As clear as spring water,
    As round and bright as pearls.
    The Yi Compatriots on the Greater and Lesser Liang Mountains
    Jidi Yihe, a heroic guerrilla fighter from the Xikang Yi Youth Revolutionary Vanguard Column, brought the love and respect of the one million Yi people distributed north of the Jinsha River, south of the Dadu River, and in the Greater and Lesser Liang Mountains to Chairman Mao.
    Jidi Yihe enthusiastically described the liberation of the Yi people of Xikang from their suffering: Our Yi people of Xikang have suffered and been discriminated against. The Kuomintang reactionaries called us the "Lolo" people, oppressed us, divided us, killed us, and drove us to live in the barren mountains. When the Red Army passed through our hometown, they sowed the seeds of struggle for us. From then on, under the oppressed life, our Yi people began to fight against the reactionaries until liberation. Last March, our Yi people organized the Revolutionary Vanguard Column and established contact with the Communist Party. We cooperated with the heroic People's Liberation Army to quickly liberate Xichang. Since then, our Yi people have begun to live a happy life, and we are no longer discriminated against. Chairman Mao liberated us from the mountains. In Butuo, a place in the Greater Liang Mountains, there are more than 8,000 Yi households. In the past, they had always resisted the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, but today they all automatically and enthusiastically ask the Communist Party to lead them.

　　太阳照到西南深山里
    ——访西南各民族代表团
    柏生
    从边远的西南山区，来京参加国庆的十九个民族——西康、云南、川西的藏族，贵州的苗族，云贵的回族，西康的彝族，云南的泰族、僰族，贵州的仲家，云南的民家、摩些、阿西、撒尼、爱黎、傈傈、怒、蒲满、卡瓦、阿卡、儸黑族以及少数民族聚居地方的汉族——的六十五位代表及七十三位文工团员，把西南各民族兄弟在这民族团结的大家庭里所感到的自由和喜悦，带来告诉给毛主席；把他们最心爱的礼物，自己民族的服饰和名贵的珍产，带来敬献给毛主席；把他们的热情、纯朴的歌舞带到北京来表演，受到了北京人民的热烈欢迎。
    在北京西郊公园，那清代帝王皇后曾居住过的一所古色古香的华丽的房间里，我会到了这些从西南深山里跋涉来到的民族兄弟代表们。
    由团长王维舟的介绍，我访问了几位不同民族的代表。
    藏民热盼见到毛主席
    西康藏族代表邦达多吉——代表团的副团长、现任康定军管会副主任，和西康甘孜喇嘛阿旺嘉错兴奋地述说着藏民爱戴毛主席和人民解放军的情景。他们对中国各民族有了毛主席这样一位英明的领袖感到骄傲。今年四月，在西康藏民日夜盼望下，人民解放军终于解放了西康。这支十余年前长征时曾经过西康大草原和大荒山的队伍，今天又带着人民的幸福来了。共产党的伟大民族政策和解放军的铁的纪律及艰苦作风，深深地感动了西康的藏民。藏民热烈地拥护着共产党和人民政府。
    回想过去西康藏民在国民党大汉族主义的统治下，被分割得四分五裂，长期过着苦难的日子时，邦达多吉激动地说：我们永远忘不了对反动派的仇恨，我们被他们歧视，压迫得不能翻身。但今天，共产党把我们解放了，我们光荣地来到北京，见到了毛主席，我们真好像很久离开了父母的孩子，一旦见到了亲爱的父母一样。我一定要把在人民首都所见到的人民力量的伟大场面告诉我们藏族的兄弟。
    苗家出了头
    来自贵州的苗族代表李儒云，亲切地道出了贵州二百多万苗民对毛主席的感激。这位西南各民族代表团的副团长，是贵州省民族事务委员会的副秘书长。他生动地描叙着苗家翻身的故事。
    他说：在黔东清水江一带，是住着苗家人民最多的地方，那里百分之七十的苗民都是贫雇农。过去由于反动统治的剥削和压榨，为了交租子，我们那里有句谚语：“抓把泥巴打老鸦，都是老板（地主）的”。每年有两个月到四个月苗民没有粮食吃，而且经常没有盐巴吃。因为穷困，人和牲口都是住在一个屋子里，因此疾病也常来侵袭着我们苦难的苗民。最使我们苗民痛恨的，是国民党反动派用大汉族主义压迫我们，挑拨我们的团结，使我们更抬不起头来。有这么一首歌，描述了我们苦命的苗家：
        太阳落山红啊！
        月亮出来黄啊！
        苗家要出头，
        摆脱苦和愁，
        好比月亮赶太阳啊！
        一世也赶不上啊！
    然而今天，太阳照到了西南的深山里，我们这一向为人瞧不起的苗家，抬起头来了。在我们的太阳——毛主席的照耀下得到了温暖。
    我们翻了身，在政治上提高了地位。在人民的政府中，人民的代表会上有了我们苗民的代表参加，我们可以用自己民族的语言，穿着自己民族的服装，昂起头来在人民的会场上讲话了。我们永远不再被人歧视。我们苗族每个人民都深深地感激着毛主席，你不听见吗？我们文工团的几个苗族女孩子，不是在生动地歌唱着“想念毛主席”。她们的歌声描述着当毛主席长征经过我们苗家地方，写下字在寨边，叫我们苗家觉醒起来。毛主席走后，苗民日夜的想念，直到解放。你听：
    …………………
    我们等了又等，
    等了十四年，
    十五年到了，
    我们的父亲——救星来到了。
    来叫我们起来，
    我们就聚集在一起，
    跟着我们的毛主席走。
　
    我们有吃有穿，
    变得白胖胖，
    像泉水一样清清爽爽，
    像珠子一样圆圆亮亮。
    大小凉山上的彝胞
    西康彝族青年革命先锋纵队的英勇游击队员吉狄依和，带来了分布在西康金沙江以北，大渡河以南，大小凉山区域的一百万彝族人民对毛主席的敬爱。
    吉狄依和热情地描述着西康彝族人民从苦难的日子里获得解放的经过：我们西康彝族人民过去受尽了苦难和歧视，国民党反动派称我们是倮倮族，压迫我们，分化我们，杀害我们，将我们赶到荒山上去住。红军长征时，经过我们的家乡，红军为我们撒下了战斗的种子，从此在被压迫的生活下，我们彝族人民开始与反动派斗争直到解放。去年三月，我们彝民组织了革命先锋纵队，与共产党取得了连系，我们配合英勇的人民解放军很快的解放了西昌。从此我们彝民开始过着幸福的生活，我们不再受人歧视。毛主席把我们从山上解放了。在大凉山区布拖地方，有八千多户彝民，过去一直抗拒着国民党反动派的统治，但今天他们都自动热烈地要求共产党来领导他们了。    （未完）
