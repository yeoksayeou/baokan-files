　　To maintain reasonable cotton prices and protect the interests of cotton farmers:
    Changshu and Jiangyin comprehensively purchase new cotton; the phenomenon of price gouging by private merchants has been stopped.
    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Su Nan Daily News: The branches of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation in Changshu County and Jiangyin County have established purchasing networks in various cotton-producing areas and have begun comprehensively purchasing new cotton, maintaining reasonable cotton prices and protecting the interests of cotton farmers.
    Changshu and Jiangyin are the main cotton-producing areas in southern Jiangsu Province, apart from the Songjiang Special District (where the East China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation organizes purchasing). This year's cotton harvest is generally good. Changshu's total output is approximately 180,000 dan of seed cotton, an increase of about 120 percent compared to last year. Jiangyin County planted more than 58,000 mu of cotton this year, with a total harvest of 50,000 dan of seed cotton. This year's cotton matured earlier, with the first batch appearing on the market more than a month ago. Now, in the fields, apart from American cotton, there is very little Chinese cotton left.
    The two county branches of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation began arranging purchasing work in early September. Changyinsha District in Changshu County, because new cotton appeared on the market early, began purchasing in mid-September. Jiangyin started purchasing on September 21st. By October 6th, purchasing agencies in various townships had comprehensively started purchasing. The two counties have appropriately set up cotton purchasing points in various places, forming a purchasing network that penetrates into the townships.
    When new cotton appeared on the market but the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation had not yet started purchasing, there were instances of private merchants suppressing prices to purchase cotton. In the Dongxu Market area of Changshu, private merchants and peddlers once suppressed the price of ginned cotton to 6.4 million yuan per dan and seed cotton to 2.1 million yuan per dan. They purchased a total of about 10,000 dan of seed cotton. Although the number was not large, some cotton farmers suffered significant losses. Price gouging by private merchants also occurred in Jiangyin. After the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation purchased at reasonable prices, this price suppression phenomenon was stopped. Under the leadership of state-owned companies, prices were raised, and the phenomena of adding water and impurities were reduced, and the quality was also improved. In this way, reasonable cotton prices were maintained, and the interests of cotton farmers were protected. Changyinsha District in Changshu purchased a total of 1,930 dan of ginned cotton in half a month, and Dongxu Market received 375 dan of ginned cotton in three days. Fuchuan Town in Jiangyin can also receive about 100 dan of cotton linters every day. During the purchase, the company stipulated the moisture and impurities contained in order to improve the quality of cotton. However, because it failed to explain this well to the farmers, many cotton farmers sent unqualified cotton to the purchasing point. Some purchasing cadres were overly mechanical and returned all unqualified cotton, but private merchants and cotton firms accepted it as usual, which aroused dissatisfaction among cotton farmers with the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation. The company has now paid attention to this and is preparing to gradually overcome it.
    After the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation started purchasing cotton, the cotton farmers were very satisfied with the cotton prices. Also, because the government provided cotton seeds and soybean cakes on loan this spring, solving production difficulties, the cotton farmers have realized that the government is protecting them. Everyone is preparing for how to grow cotton better next year.

### 保持合理棉价维护棉农利益  常熟江阴全面收购新棉  私商压价收购的现象已被制止

　　保持合理棉价维护棉农利益
    常熟江阴全面收购新棉  私商压价收购的现象已被制止
    【本报讯】据苏南日报消息：常熟县和江阴县的中国花纱布公司分支机构，已经在各个产棉地区设立了收购网，开始全面收购新棉，保持了棉价的合理，维护了棉农的利益。
    常熟和江阴是苏南除松江专区以外的主要产棉区（松江专区由华东花纱布公司组织力量收购），今年棉花一般收成还好。常熟全部约产十八万担籽棉；比去年产量增加百分之一百二十左右。江阴县今年共植棉五万八千多亩地，全部可收五万担籽花。今年棉花成熟较早，头批已经登场月余，现在田里除了美棉外，中棉已经很少了。
    两个县的花纱布公司机构，在九月初就开始布置收购工作。常熟县常阴沙区因为新棉登场早，在九月中旬就已开始收购。江阴在九月二十一日开秤的。到十月六日，各乡镇收花机构已全面开秤收购。该两县均在各地适当设置收花处，形成了一个深入乡镇的收购网。
    当新棉登场而花纱布公司还没有收购时，曾有私商压价收花的情形。常熟的东徐市一带，私商小贩曾把皮花价压到六十四万元一担，籽花二十一万元一担。他们约共收一万担籽花，数字虽然不多，但一部分棉农已吃亏很大了。在江阴也发生过私商压价收购的事。花纱布公司以合理价格收购后，已制止了此项压价现象，并在国营公司的领导下，提高了价格，添水添杂现象也减少了，品质也提高了。这样，维持了合理的棉价和保护了棉农的利益。常熟的常阴沙区在半个月中共收了一千九百三十担皮花，东徐市在三天中收到了三百七十五担皮花；江阴的福全镇每天也能收到一百担左右花衣。在收购中，公司为了提高棉花品质，规定了所含水份与杂质，但因未能很好的向农民说明，便有许多棉农将不合标准的棉花送到收花处。收购干部有的过分机械，不合标准便都退回，但私商花行却照收，这样便引起了棉农对花纱布公司的不满。现公司已引起重视，并准备逐步克服。
    花纱布公司开始收花后，棉农对棉价都很满意，并且由于政府在今年春季的贷给棉种和豆饼，解决了生产困难，棉农们已认识到政府是保护他们的，大家准备着明年怎样来更好的种好棉花。
