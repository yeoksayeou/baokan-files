　　Public Shandong Electric Factory Director Liu and others
    Accept Criticism and Resolve to Improve Work

To the Editors:

    We read the letter of criticism of our factory's work by Comrade Wang Huihua, published in the "People's Forum" on September 21st. After reading it, we convened a meeting of responsible comrades from the Party, government, and labor union for repeated study. Everyone unanimously agreed that Comrade Wang Huihua's criticism was entirely correct and of great help to us in improving our work. In addition to our heartfelt gratitude, we are determined to solicit opinions from our worker comrades on the factory's overall work based on this criticism in order to improve our future work.

    On September 23rd, we convened a management committee meeting to study Comrade Wang Huihua's opinions and review our past work. Everyone believed that the main reason for our past failures was, as Comrade Wang Huihua pointed out, that leading cadres lacked the idea of relying on the masses of workers to run the enterprise well. In the past, we mistakenly believed that workers did not understand anything and did not carefully study certain constructive suggestions from worker comrades, which resulted in multiple accidents. For example, when a worker pointed out a problem with a motor and suggested that it should be repaired immediately, the leadership did not adopt the suggestion. As a result, the motor broke down, work was suspended for two days, and losses were incurred.

    Secondly, leading cadres were busy with administrative work all day long, handing over the central task of the factory (production) to the engineering section. The management committee's standing committee met once a week, mostly to study administrative matters such as repairing houses and reorganizing the power grid, without studying the production plan and problems in the production process. At the same time, because there was no preparation before the meeting, the standing committee members often did not know what issues to study when the meeting convened. Everyone argued in a mess at the meeting, and nothing was accomplished.

    Thirdly, the coordination between the Party, government, and labor union was not done well. Everyone relied on each other on some issues, or did not communicate with each other.

    In the future, we must combine with rectification to improve the shortcomings in our work and rely on the masses of workers to run the factory well.

　　公营山东电气厂刘厂长等
    接受批评决心改进工作编辑同志：
    九月二十一日《人民园地》刊载了王辉华同志对本厂工作的批评信。我们阅读后，曾召集党、政、工负责同志反复研究。大家一致认为王辉华同志的批评完全是正确的，对我们改进工作有很大的帮助。我们除衷心感谢外，决心根据这一批评征求工人同志对全厂工作的意见，来改进今后的工作。
    我们在九月二十三日召开了管委会，研究了王辉华同志的意见，并检查了过去的工作。大家认为过去工作没有搞好的主要原因，正如王辉华同志所指出的，是因为领导干部缺乏依靠工人群众搞好企业的思想。我们过去错误地认为工人不懂什么，对于工人同志某些建设性的建议不去细心研究，因而产生了事故多起。如电动机有毛病，工人提出应马上修理，但领导上没有采纳。结果，电动机坏了，停工两日，造成了损失。
    其次，领导干部成天忙于事务工作，把工厂的中心工作（生产）交给了工务科。管委会常委会每周一次会议，大部是研究事务工作，如修房子，整理电网等，而对生产计划及生产过程中的问题，则不加研究。同时因会前没有准备，开会时常委都不知道要研究什么问题。大家在会上乱吵一顿，得不到什么结果。
    再次，党、政、工之间的配合做得不好，大家对有些问题互相依赖，或则互不联系。
    今后，我们必须结合整风，改进工作中的缺点，依靠工人群众办好工厂。
