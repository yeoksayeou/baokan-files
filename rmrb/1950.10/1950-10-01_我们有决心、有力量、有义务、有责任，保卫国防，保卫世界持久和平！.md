　　We have the determination, the strength, the obligation, and the responsibility to defend our national defense and safeguard lasting world peace!
    Li Changlin, Combat Hero of the Southwest Military Region, Second Field Army
    I joined the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army at the age of sixteen. To this day, I have participated in revolutionary wars for seventeen years. I have experienced more than three hundred battles, large and small. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, under the correct command of commanders at all levels, and with the support of the people of the whole country, our People's Liberation Army defeated Japanese imperialism and then Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, supported by American imperialism. Our army is invincible. The purpose of our operations is to strive for a happy life for the people of the whole country and to enjoy lasting democracy and peace. Through more than twenty years of struggle, we have realized our hopes. Now we must resolutely defend the fruits of this hope. We will not allow any imperialists or their running dogs to come and destroy or plunder our fruits. On this National Day, I swear to Chairman Mao, to the people of the whole country, and to the people of the whole world that we have the determination, the strength, the obligation, and the responsibility to defend our national defense and safeguard lasting world peace! We are with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of Chairman Mao; we are with the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world, under the leadership of the great international revolutionary teacher, Marshal Stalin. We will surely be victorious! The American imperialists' invasion of Korea and our Taiwan, and their repeated violations of our Northeast airspace, are acts of aggression that have committed heinous crimes. If they do not immediately withdraw their invading troops from Korea and Taiwan, immediately cease their crimes of unreasonably violating our airspace, and take responsibility for apologizing and compensating for the consequences they have caused, they will suffer the consequences of their actions!

　　我们有决心、有力量、有义务、有责任，保卫国防，保卫世界持久和平！
    西南军区、二野战斗英雄  李长林
    我从十六岁起就加入中国工农红军，到今天，参加革命战争十七个年头了。我经历了大小三百多次战斗。我们人民解放军在毛主席、朱总司令英明领导下，在各级指挥员正确指挥下，在全国人民的支援下，打垮了一个日本帝国主义，又打垮了美国帝国主义支持下的蒋介石匪帮。我们的军队是无敌的。我们作战的目的，是争取全国人民过幸福的生活，享受持久的民主与和平。二十多年来的斗争，我们已实现了自己的希望，现在我们更要坚决保卫这个希望的成果，任何帝国主义及其走狗，敢于来破坏和掠夺我们的果实，我们都不答应。我在国庆日这天，向毛主席来宣誓，向全国人民来宣誓，向全世界人民来宣誓，我们有决心，有力量，有义务，有责任，保卫国防，保卫世界持久和平！我们和全国人民在一起，在毛主席领导之下；和苏联以及世界上爱好和平的人民在一起，在伟大的国际革命导师斯大林大元帅领导之下，一定能够胜利！美国帝国主义者侵略朝鲜和我国台湾，又屡次侵犯我国东北领空，这是一件犯了滔天罪恶的侵略行为，如果它不立即撤退在朝鲜和台湾的侵略军，对于无理侵犯我国领空的罪行不立即停止，并负责对已造成的结果道歉与赔偿，它将会自食其果的！
