　　To the Editor:
    I am a worker at the Beijing Construction Bureau Brick Kiln Factory No. 2. In July of this year, when the factory distributed wages, foreman Su Deshun used his power to forcibly borrow a total of 1,240 jin of corn from the wages of fifteen of us workers (a similar situation occurred last period, where he forcibly borrowed wages from workers amounting to 2 million RMB). There were also instances of embezzling workers' wages. When recruiting workers, he told them: monthly workers receive 160 jin of corn per month. Skilled workers receive 210 jin of corn per month. In reality, the factory stipulates that monthly workers receive 210 jin of corn per month, and skilled workers receive 315 jin. In this way, he can embezzle 50 jin of corn per worker per month from monthly workers, and 105 jin from skilled workers. Su Deshun, regardless of the workers' production output, only gives each person 100 jin of corn per month. He has deducted a total of about 6,000 jin of corn from workers' wages.

    Every month when wages are distributed, Su Deshun instructs his eldest son, Su Dunyi (a kiln loading technician at the factory), to take money home for the workers (because many workers are from his hometown), in order to extract travel expenses from them (regardless of the amount of money being sent, each person uniformly pays 5,000 RMB in travel expenses).

    In July, when wages were distributed, foreman Su Deshun forced worker Zhang Lisheng to lend him 50 jin of corn. Zhang Lisheng said to him, "The weather is getting cold, and I have very few clothes and need to buy more. I will lend it to you next month." Su was very unhappy at the time, and two days later, he notified Zhang Lisheng, "The factory is now full, you can go home." He also said, "It is the factory director's order, I have no choice." Zhang Lisheng had no choice but to go to the general factory to find the factory director to resolve the matter. It turned out that the factory director knew nothing about this.

    Su Deshun also used his power to recruit private individuals. His nephew, Wang Lisen, is nominally a monthly worker at the factory, but in reality, he does nothing. He also uses his uncle's connections to threaten workers, which affects their work morale. In addition, the cook is his son-in-law; the night watchman and office worker are also people related to him. Every day, there are about five or six people in the factory who do not work properly and only freeload.

    Such a serious problem has occurred in the factory, and it has been delayed until now without a good solution. This shows that the factory's organization is unsound and that the leadership has committed serious bureaucracy. I hope the factory leadership will conduct an in-depth review.

### 京市砖窑二分厂一工人批评领工克扣工资

　　京市砖窑二分厂一工人批评领工克扣工资编辑同志：
    我是京市建设局砖窑厂第二分厂的工人。今年七月，厂里发工资的时候，领工苏德顺利用职权，强借我们十五名工人的工资计玉米一千二百四十斤（上期也发生过这种情事，强借工人工资计人民券二百万元之多）。同时还发生过私吞工人的工资的事情。他在招工时，向工人说：月工每月工资玉米一百六十斤。技工每月工资二百一十斤。实际上该厂规定月工每月工资二百一十斤，技工三百一十五斤。这样他每月可私吞月工每人工资玉米五十斤，技工每人一百另五斤。苏德顺不管工人的生产量的多少，每人每月都只给玉米一百斤。他共计克扣工人工资约有六千余斤。
    该厂每月发工资时，苏德顺即叫他大儿苏敦义（该厂装窑技工）给工人往家带款（因有很多工人是他同乡），以便从中索取路费（不管捎款多少，每人一律付给路费五千元）。
    七月份发工资时，领工苏德顺强迫工人张立生借给玉米五十斤。张立生对他说：“天气快冷了，我衣服很少，需要补充，等下月份再借给你吧。”当时苏很不高兴，隔二天即通知张立生：“现在厂子人数已满，你回家吧。”又说：“是厂长的命令，我没有办法。”张立生无奈，只好到总厂去找厂长解决，原来厂长根本不知道这件事情。
    苏德顺又利用职权招用私人。他外甥王立森，名义上是该厂月工，实际上什么也不干。他并借他舅舅的关系，威胁工人，影响了工人的工作情绪。此外，作饭的是他的姑爷；打更办事务的亦都是与他有裙带关系的人。每天工厂里差不多有五六个人不好好工作，专门混饭吃。
    该厂发生这样严重的问题，一直拖延到现在还没有得到很好的解决。足见该厂组织不健全，领导上犯了严重的官僚主义。希望该厂领导上深入检讨。
