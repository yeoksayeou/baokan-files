　　Southwest Region Gradually Improves Work on Relieving Unemployed Workers
    Implements the Policy of Production for Self-Relief and Work Relief
    [Report from this newspaper] The work of relieving unemployed workers in various parts of the Southwest Region has made considerable achievements and gained some work experience. In order to further improve this work, some cadres responsible for relief work should change their simplistic and detached-from-the-masses style, further immerse themselves in the masses, combine with activists among unemployed workers, organize unemployed workers, conduct propaganda and education, and implement the policy of production for self-relief, work relief, and reasonable relief measures.
    According to incomplete statistics, there are 154,059 unemployed workers and 77,847 semi-unemployed workers in major cities such as Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang, and various parts of Xikang and Sichuan in the Southwest Region. Among unemployed workers, handicraft workers, porters, and shop assistants are more numerous than industrial workers.
    As of mid-September, a total of 21,196 people had received relief. Among them, 17,756 people participated in the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and municipal road construction through work relief, 3,254 people achieved self-reliance through production, changed occupations, or were sent back to their hometowns, 151 people received relief grain, and 35 people participated in relief work.
    When the People's Liberation Army entered the Southwest, it was felt during the takeover of cities that the problem of unemployed workers had to be properly resolved. After April of this year, Chongqing and Guiyang began to systematically register unemployed workers and launched a widespread donation campaign from top to bottom. A total of 1,543,970,000 yuan and 1,685,800 catties of grain were collected throughout the region.
    Since the Central People's Government's State Council issued instructions on relieving unemployed workers in July, various localities have reorganized and established relief committees with a focus, and systematically carried out the registration, organization, and relief work for unemployed workers. At the beginning of this work, various localities did not seriously carry out propaganda and explanation work; the registration work was mainly carried out by local labor bureaus, and they failed to rely on trade unions and mobilize activists among the masses to carry out in-depth investigation and organization work. Therefore, they mostly did not understand the ideological situation of unemployed workers. Unemployed workers had various concerns in their minds, and coupled with the rumors spread by bandits and special agents, most of them suspected that registration would not solve the problem, or feared being forced to do hard labor. In eastern Sichuan, only seven people registered in five days. On the other hand, many hooligans, ruffians, and disbanded soldiers pretended to be unemployed workers and mixed into the registration. After registration, they failed to seriously conduct review and organizational education work, and failed to timely overcome the idea of waiting for relief and establish the idea of self-reliance through production. When providing relief, due to the failure to follow the mass line and mobilize everyone to democratically discuss and evaluate, inappropriate relief phenomena occurred. Some opium addicts quickly squandered the money after receiving relief. In organizing transportation, some were unwilling to work and ate up the capital. Regarding the work of introducing unemployed workers to employment, they did not jointly study and discuss with all parties and make specific decisions, so that some enterprises and institutions mostly hired people through private relationships instead of through employment agencies, and the employment agencies failed to play their due role.
    Various localities have begun to pay attention to correcting these shortcomings. Chengdu has done the best. The Chengdu Relief Committee closely cooperated with the trade union and gave full play to the organizational strength of trade unions in various industries, paying attention to following the mass line in its work. Before and after registration, they widely carried out propaganda work using newspapers, movies, radio, oral propaganda, and other methods. The Relief Committee worked conscientiously and responsibly, and promptly studied and resolved problems in the work. This experience has been promoted in the Southwest. Chongqing has organized the registered unemployed workers according to administrative regions and streets, democratically elected group leaders and team leaders, and formed groups according to different requirements, such as road repair and production for self-relief, and selected a group of activists for training.
    Wherever this is done, the problem of unemployed workers has been relatively appropriately resolved. The emotions of unemployed workers have changed, the relationship between the Party and the People's Government and the working class has become closer, and some unemployed workers said: "Such work of relieving unemployed workers is the first time in Chinese history." The prestige of trade unions among unemployed workers has also greatly increased. Workers have confirmed from their actual lives that trade unions are serving the working class. In the relief work, trade unions have been further developed and improved.
    In September, the Southwest Region further studied and decided on relief measures: (1) Expanding work relief by having 20,000 people participate in the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, and organizing another group of people to participate in municipal construction, repairing roads and warehouses, etc. (2) Production for self-relief, mainly through transportation and sales cooperation and participation in military supply order production. (3) Continuing to mobilize people to return to their hometowns for production. (4) Adding ordinary training classes and technical training classes. (5) Issuing relief grain, with a planned 2,000,000 catties for Chongqing and 8,400,000 catties for various parts of Sichuan. (The numbers for Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang have not yet been determined.)
    The Southwest Region has gained the following important experiences in the work of relieving unemployed workers: (1) Boldly and freely organize unemployed workers to carry out mass review and in-depth organizational education work. (2) Combine registration, relief, and organizational education work. (3) Pay attention to cultivating activists among unemployed workers, organizing and absorbing them to carry out relief work.

### 西南区救济失业工人工作逐步改进  贯彻生产自救以工代赈方针

　　西南区救济失业工人工作逐步改进
    贯彻生产自救以工代赈方针
    【本报讯】西南区各地失业工人的救济工作，已作出不少成绩，并获得了若干工作经验。为了进一步作好这一工作，若干担任救济工作的干部，应改变简单行事及脱离群众的作风，进一步深入群众，结合失业工人中的积极分子，把失业工人组织起来，进行宣传教育，贯彻生产自救，以工代赈的方针及合理的救济办法。
    根据不完全统计，西南区重庆、昆明、贵阳等主要城市及西康、四川各地，共有失业工人一五四、○五九人，半失业工人七七、八四七人。在失业工人中，手工业工人、搬运工人、店员多于产业工人。
    至九月中为止，已经得到救济的共二一、一九六人。其中以工代赈，参加修筑成渝铁路，市政建设公路者共一七、七五六人，生产自救、转业及遣散还乡者共三、二五四人，已发救济粮者一五一人，参加救济工作者三五人。
    当人民解放军进入西南后，在接管城市工作中，即感到失业工人问题必须予以妥善地解决。今年四月以后，在渝、筑两城市开始有计划的登记失业工人，自上而下地普遍展开捐款运动，全区共收款十五亿四千三百九十七万余元，粮一百六十八万五千八百余斤。
    自七月中央人民政府政务院发布救济失业工人的指示后，各地即有重点地改组和建立了救济委员会，有计划地开展失业工人的登记、组织和救济工作。这一工作开始时，各地均未认真进行宣传解释工作；登记工作主要由各地劳动局进行，未能依靠工会，及在群众中发动积极分子，进行深入的调查和组织工作。因此，多不了解失业工人的思想情况。失业工人思想上是有各种顾虑的，加以匪特乘机造谣，大多怀疑登记后不能解决问题，或怕强迫作苦工。川东五天只登记了七个人。另一方面，则有不少流氓地痞、散兵游勇等冒充失业工人，混入登记。而在登记后，又未能认真进行审查和组织教育工作，未能及时克服坐待救济的思想，树立生产自救的思想。在进行救济时，由于未走群众路线，发动大家民主评议，以致发生救济不当的现象，有些吃鸦片的得到救济后，很快把钱挥霍光了。在组织运输时，有的不愿劳动，将本钱吃掉。对介绍失业工人的就业工作，没有和各方面共同研究讨论，做出具体决定，以致某些企业机关用人多不通过介绍所，而是通过私人关系，介绍所未能起应有的作用。
    各地对于这些缺点，已开始注意纠正。以成都做的最好。成都的救委会与工会密切配合，充分发挥各业工会的组织力量，在工作中注意走群众路线。在登记前后，利用报纸、电影、广播、口头宣传等办法，广泛地进行了宣传工作。救委会工作认真负责，及时研究解决工作中的问题。此一经验已在西南推广。重庆市已将登记的失业工人，按行政区及街道组织起来，民主选出组长、队长，又根据不同要求，按修路、生产自救等分别组成小组，并抽调了一部分积极分子加以训练。
    凡是这样作的地方，失业工人的问题就得到了比较适当的解决。失业工人的情绪已有转变，党与人民政府和工人阶级的关系更加密切了，有的失业工人说：“象这样的救济失业工人的工作，中国有史以来是第一次。”工会在失业工人中的威信也大大提高了。工人从实际生活中，确认为工会是为工人阶级办事的。在救济工作中，并进一步发展和健全了工会。
    西南区在九月份已进一步研究和决定了救济办法：（一）以工代赈，参加修成渝路的扩大到二万人，另外组织一部分人参加市政建设，修公路、仓库等。（二）生产自救，主要是运销合作及参加军需定货生产。（三）继续动员还乡生产。（四）加办普通训练班和技术训练班。（五）发救济粮，计划渝市二百万斤，四川各地共八百四十万斤。（云、贵、康数目尚未定。）
    西南区各地在救济失业工人工作中，获得以下几点重要经验：（一）要大胆放手地把失业工人组织起来，进行群众性的审查和深入地组织教育工作。（二）登记、救济、组织教育各项工作要结合进行。（三）注意培养失业工人中的积极分子，组织和吸收他们进行救济工作。
