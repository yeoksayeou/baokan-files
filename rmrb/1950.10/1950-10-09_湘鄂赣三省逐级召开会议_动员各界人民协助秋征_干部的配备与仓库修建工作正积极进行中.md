Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 5th: Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces are deploying the autumn grain collection work level by level. In general areas, arrangements have now been made down to the township level. In key areas and townships such as Xishui and Huangpi in Hubei, and Changsha in Hunan, collection has already begun. In order to implement the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas" and complete the autumn grain collection task on schedule, local people's governments have convened cadre meetings at all levels. Hunan Province is combining these meetings with rectification meetings to discuss and arrange the autumn grain collection work. At the cadre meetings at all levels, the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas" were studied, experiences and lessons from past grain collections were summarized and reviewed, and discussions were held on how to complete the autumn grain collection work. Erroneous views held by some cadres, who set the completion of tasks against the implementation of policies, as well as the thoughtlessness and carelessness arising from the belief that this year's tasks were light, were criticized. Some cadre meetings formulated specific methods for combining the autumn grain collection work with the rent reduction movement. To mobilize people from all walks of life to assist the people's government in completing grain collection, so as to more rationally allocate the burden of tasks based on acreage, population, and the abundance of the harvest, most counties in Hubei Province and more than twenty counties in Jiangxi have already convened county-level people's representative conferences, while districts and townships have universally convened peasant representative conferences. Jiangxi Province has also stipulated the establishment of grain collection committees at all levels. In the rural areas of the three provinces, the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas" and policies such as "whoever cultivates the land, harvests the crops, and bears the burden" are being widely publicized, and peasants are being mobilized to do a good job in investigating unreported land and assessing yields. While carrying out the above work, the three provinces are stepping up preparations for the autumn grain collection, with a large number of warehouses under construction. The newly built and repaired warehouses in the Changsha Special District of Hunan can hold approximately 490 million catties of grain, and the large warehouses in thirty-six counties of Hubei Province have also been completed. The allocation and training of warehouse cadres are also underway.
