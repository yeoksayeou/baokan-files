　　One-Year Work Report of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
    (October 1949 – September 1950)

    The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association General Headquarters was officially established on October 5, 1949. Over the past year, influenced by the victorious development of the domestic and international situation, under the leadership of the President and the Council of this Association, with the support of all parties and the assistance of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and with the active efforts of comrades working in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations across the country, Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organizations have been established in most provinces and the vast majority of medium-sized and large cities across the country, and vigorous Sino-Soviet Friendship Association work has been carried out, achieving tremendous results and greatly educating the Chinese people. Now the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has become a massive mass organization with over three million members. On the occasion of the first anniversary of the establishment of the General Headquarters, we hereby present a brief report on the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association across the country over the past year, as follows:

A. Extensively launching the movement of Sino-Soviet friendship and learning from the Soviet Union.

    Since the General Headquarters began preparations last July, it has used great effort to call on the people of the country to launch the work of Sino-Soviet friendship and learning from the Soviet Union. Through the official establishment of the General Headquarters, welcoming the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation, commemorating the 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution, celebrating Stalin's 70th birthday, and even celebrating the Sino-Soviet New Treaty and other major national mass activities, Sino-Soviet friendship, learning from the Soviet Union, and carrying out the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association have had a profound impact on the Chinese people, laying a preliminary foundation for the development and continued progress of the Friendship Association's work in the future.

    According to partial materials, in the three national mass activities of welcoming the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation, celebrating the 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution, and celebrating Stalin's 70th birthday alone, statistics from only 45 cities show that more than 2,869,600 people participated (the actual total number of participants was certainly much higher). The scope of these activities covered large and medium-sized cities across the country, as well as some small cities and some rural areas. As for the celebration of the Sino-Soviet New Treaty movement, the scope was even wider. In these movements, the main methods adopted were mass gatherings, lectures, forums, parades, etc., and street propaganda, costume performances, recreational evenings, train propaganda, clapper talks, drum lyrics, magic lantern shows, book propaganda, etc. were used.

    It is obvious that only when the Chinese people have eliminated the rule of the reactionaries and obtained the freedom to express their own minds can they express such deep friendship towards the Soviet Union on such a large scale.

B. Gradually and specifically introducing various aspects of Soviet social life, culture, and science.

    At the beginning of this year, the General Headquarters proposed to break through general appeals and commemorations and celebrations, and establish regular work for Sino-Soviet friendship and learning from the Soviet Union. Thus, the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in various regions also gradually shifted from large-scale appeals to in-depth introductions of various aspects of the Soviet Union, based on their own strengths, and used these methods to establish the regular work of Friendship Associations at all levels. Over the past year, the General Headquarters and various regions have mainly carried out the following regular work:

    (1) Publishing books and periodicals. The General Headquarters and various regions have published 38 types of periodicals in the past year. These include 21 booklet types, 5 newspaper types, and 12 supplements to general newspapers; in terms of nature, there are 2 internal publications of purely Friendship Association business, 1 Russian language publication, and 2 pictorial magazines; the rest are comprehensive publications that generally introduce the Soviet Union and report on business. Among them, the contents of the General Headquarters' "Sino-Soviet Friendship," the Northeast's "Introduction to the Soviet Union," the Lushun-Dalian's "Friendship," the Wuhan's "Beneficial Friend," and the Shanghai's "Soviet Knowledge" are relatively substantial, and the number of copies issued is relatively large and the scope is wider. Among the newspaper-type periodicals, the Northeast's "Northeast Sino-Soviet Friendship," the Beijing's "Beijing Friendship Association," and the Chahar's "Sino-Soviet Friendship" have a larger number of copies issued. Among them, "Northeast Sino-Soviet Friendship" is simple and easy to understand and meets the requirements of the majority of members. Currently, more than 35,000 copies are issued each issue, which has penetrated into the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association member groups, and they are often organized to study and guide them, with strong guiding significance. Excluding general newspaper supplements, according to statistics, the total number of copies issued in the past year for 19 of the above 26 types of periodicals was 1,094,500.

    In addition, the General Headquarters and various regions have also published many separate publications introducing the Soviet Union in the past year. According to incomplete materials, there are a total of 108 types (including series and pamphlets). Among them, the versions of "Principles of Michurin Biology," "Stalin on the Chinese Revolution," "Stalin's Life and Doctrine," "Makarenko's Life and His Pedagogical Doctrine," "Soviet Cultural and Artistic Workers Delegation in China for One Month," and "Heredity and Variation" published by the General Headquarters are larger. Many small series and popular pamphlets published by various regions that are suitable for the central tasks of propaganda and education in a certain period have played a great educational role among the broad masses.

    In order to facilitate our publishing research work, the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries has given the General Headquarters 6,569 books, 1,075 pamphlets, 164 types of magazines (11,185 copies), and 15 types of newspapers in the past year.

    (2) Film work. Although film work is greatly restricted by equipment and materials, due to the enthusiastic demands and support of the masses, a lot of work has also been done through various efforts. In the past year, the General Headquarters and the Beijing, Lushun-Dalian, Rehe, Shanghai, and other branches have brought their own projectors to tour and show films in their respective regions, which has been warmly welcomed by the masses. The General Headquarters has shown 591 films in 25 cities, counties, and Mongolian banners in the past year, allowing 1,718,260 viewers to see Soviet films. Among them, there were peasants who drove carts from dozens of miles away to the screening location and waited for three days to see Soviet films. In the in-depth work in the Mongolian banners, many Mongolians came from hundreds of miles away and saw Soviet movies for the first time. Secondly, the Lushun-Dalian, Rehe, Qingdao, Lanzhou, Harbin, and other branches and sub-branches independently operated cinemas, regularly showing Soviet and Chinese progressive films, offering low-priced preferential treatment or free invitations to members and non-member audiences. Some also subsidized a portion of the funds from the operation of these cinemas. As for the sub-branches that contacted local cinemas in their own name, allowing members and the masses to enjoy a certain discount to watch movies when showing Soviet films, there are even more. According to existing materials, the Lushun-Dalian, Beijing, Kaifeng, Jiangxi, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Xi'an, Shanghai, Lanzhou, and other branches and sub-branches have all adopted this method. In addition, the General Headquarters also consulted with the Central Film Bureau, and with their assistance, has purchased projection machines on behalf of various branches and sub-branches and has begun to form 54 projection teams, which are planned to be distributed across the country for touring screenings. Currently, projection technicians are being trained in Nanjing, and work will begin in November. After these 14 projection teams begin work, the screening business of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in various regions will be greatly enhanced.

    In the film work, the conditions in the Northeast are better, and there is also more work. According to incomplete statistics in the Northeast in the past year, movie evenings alone showed 868 films, allowing 2,299,904 viewers to see Soviet films.

    (3) Photo exhibitions. The General Headquarters has held touring exhibitions of Soviet photos in 24 cities, counties, and Mongolian banners in the past year. From January to August this year alone, there were 1,407,010 visitors. Chahar, Hebei, Suiyuan, and other provinces have also implemented the method of touring exhibitions. Chahar Province has held more than 15 exhibitions, covering 8 counties and cities, with 230,000 visitors; Hebei has held 6 exhibitions, including 3 exhibitions with 115,900 visitors. As for the branches and sub-branches that hold their own exhibitions in urban areas, there are even more. According to statistics from 25 provinces and cities, 1,029 exhibitions have been held in the past year, with 6,680,187 visitors. Among them, Shanghai alone exhibited 140 times in 11 months, with 2,359,489 visitors. In order to promote photo exhibitions on a large scale, the General Headquarters began to experiment with subscribing to Soviet pictorial magazines in April of this year, cutting, pasting, and mounting them into photos suitable for exhibitions, and sending them to various regions to assist them in holding photo exhibitions. As a result, the exhibitions were easy to hold and achieved great results. Currently, many local Friendship Associations, with the assistance of the General Headquarters, have subscribed to Soviet pictorial magazines, cut them into photos, and begun exhibitions.

    (4) Inviting Soviet scholars to China to give lectures. Since March of this year, at the invitation of the General Headquarters, the Soviet experts who have come to China to give lectures successively include Nuzhdin, Giselev, Makarova, Podrev, Chesnokov, Askeev, Yudin, etc., a total of 7 people, giving 209 lectures and forums in major cities in China, with 225,233 listeners. This has greatly helped China's cultural, academic, and economic construction and has been warmly welcomed. (⑴⑶)

    (5) Holding lectures, forums, broadcasts, and other cultural activities. Under the various topics of Sino-Soviet friendship and learning from the Soviet Union, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in many regions have held various lectures, gatherings, and lectures regularly and irregularly many times in the past year. According to statistics from 12 regions such as Shanghai and Beijing, 477 times have been held, with 1,833,037 participants. In addition, some branch associations, such as Beijing, Zhengzhou, Qingdao, Hebei, and Qinhuangdao, have also created broadcasts such as "Sino-Soviet Friendship" or "Introduction to the Soviet Union," which have also achieved great results. In addition, forms such as slide shows, magic lantern shows, rooftop broadcasts, cultural sheds, Sino-Soviet friendship essay competitions, Soviet dance training classes, Soviet windows or Friendship Association windows, Yangko short plays, drum lyrics, and cross-talk have also been adopted.

    (6) Foreign liaison work. In the past year, the General Headquarters has established and maintained contact with the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the people's democratic countries, and the Soviet associations of some capitalist countries, and has separately presented various new Chinese cultural and artistic works, borrowing funds to introduce the situation of the new China to foreign countries. A total of 34 types of new Chinese records were presented to the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and 1,814 copies of books, magazines, and pictorial magazines were presented to the Soviet Friendship Associations or other people's organizations in 13 countries including the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, North Korea, Bulgaria, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, and Canada, and a total of 356 copies of books such as "The Complete Works of Lu Xun" and "Chinese People's Literature and Art Series."

    Since April of this year, Soviet children have continuously sent a large number of "Letters to Chinese Children." This Association has published them in "Sino-Soviet Friendship" or local newspapers, or used other methods to forward them to the vast number of Chinese elementary school students. After the call and mobilization of this Association, elementary school students in various regions have successively sent 4,566 letters to this Association "Letters to Soviet Children," which have been forwarded to the Soviet Union.

    In addition, in coordination with the Ministry of Culture, 3,115 pieces of Chinese photos, magazines, books, objects, and materials, etc. were collected on behalf of the Democratic China Pavilion established by the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and are currently being sorted and compiled. Once the sorting is completed, they will be transported abroad for exhibition.

    In addition, this Association, together with the Ministry of Culture, the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and other cultural organizations, collected various materials on Pushkin and Gorky in China on behalf of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and a part has been collected and forwarded to the Soviet Union.

    (7) Amateur Russian language education. In view of the fact that learning Russian has become a craze among the masses in various regions, the General Headquarters and many branches and sub-branches in various regions have established Russian language night schools to carry out amateur Russian language education. The Russian language night school of the General Headquarters has now enrolled two terms, with a total of 540 students. In addition, according to incomplete statistics, a total of 28 Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branches across the country have Russian language night schools or Russian language tutoring classes, with a total of 6,189 people participating in the study. The night school organized by the General Headquarters has compiled 6 types of teaching materials, of which 2 types have begun to be sold to the public.

    Another way to carry out amateur Russian language education is to create Russian language broadcasts. The Northeast General Branch, Beijing, Shanxi, Zhejiang, and other branches have created this Russian language broadcast. They broadcast two or three times a week, and the number of listeners is currently about 14,500 people.

C. Actively cooperating with various people's organizations to promote the signature campaign to defend world peace.

    In April of this year, Comrade Xiao San, Deputy Secretary-General of this Association, returned from participating in the Third Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace. The China Peace Committee decided to respond to the call of the Stockholm Conference and launch a widespread propaganda campaign and signature campaign to defend world peace in China. National people's organizations and democratic parties responded and called on their local organizations to actively support, sponsor, and participate in this movement. The General Headquarters issued instructions to various branches twice on May 11 and 17, calling on the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in various regions to actively cooperate with various people's organizations to promote this movement. In order to promote and inspect the progress of the movement in various regions, Comrades Xiao San and Zhao Zhongchi, Deputy Secretaries-General of this Association, also participated in the China Peace Defense World Peace Propaganda Group and made a 40-day travel lecture tour of the major cities of the East China, Central South, and Northwest Administrative Regions by Zhao Huadong of the Peace Committee. On June 29, the General Headquarters notified various regions to continue to implement the signature campaign and penetrate into the countryside.

    According to the instructions of the General Headquarters: The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branches in various regions have actively cooperated in launching this movement, and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in many regions have regarded promoting this movement as their central work in a certain period. Many members have become propagandists and activists in this movement.

    In this movement, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in various regions mostly participated in the leadership work and specific organization work of the local peace signature campaign, and mobilized their organizations, members, and cadres in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association system to actively participate and cooperate, and organized propaganda teams, compiled and published propaganda materials to promote propaganda in various directions. The branches of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organized propaganda teams, propaganda vehicles, and published big-character posters, blackboard newspapers, and street bulletin boards. The Shenyang Sino-Soviet Friendship Association mobilized 60 students from 15 middle schools to form a propaganda team for performances, lectures, and signature visits to promote propaganda to the public. The Chabei Sino-Soviet Friendship Association first organized propaganda groups and Yangko teams in the middle and primary schools in Zhangbei City to conduct street lectures and propaganda. The Xi'an Sino-Soviet Friendship Association cooperated with the Xi'an Peace Committee to publish "Friends of Peace" (newspaper supplement) for propaganda.

    In order to cooperate with this movement, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in many places held gatherings and photo exhibitions, and publicly set up stations to solicit signatures. The Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association set up signature stations in various places and streets. Anshan specially held photo exhibitions to cooperate with the signature campaign, and set up signature stations in the photo exhibition room, and more than 2,000 people signed their names in three days.

    In the propaganda and signature movement to defend world peace actively promoted by the cadres and members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, outstanding model examples emerged. Gao Yuquan, a 51-year-old female member of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and Zhang Yangshi, a 55-year-old, mobilized 8,234 people to sign their names within five days. Ren Shuhua, a female member of the Beijing Second District, mobilized more than 1,500 people to sign their names in one day. Wang Yuqin, a 16-year-old female member of Yuejiazhai in the suburbs of Xi'an, actively promoted propaganda and solicited more than 300 signatures in a few days.

    Because the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in various regions adopted the method of cooperating with this movement to carry out the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, with the development of this movement, the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association also developed. In many occasions, there are often situations where people sign their names and register to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association at the same time. After hearing the propaganda and explanation of the propagandists of the Jinzhou Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the masses reflected that Sino-Soviet friendship can also defend world peace, and I want to sign and join the association (Friendship Association). The Tangshan Sino-Soviet Friendship Association developed 15,000 members in this movement. The Jinan Sino-Soviet Friendship Association developed more than 5,700 members through the peace signature movement and established six branch associations, including the branch party school, the provincial cadre school, and the store staff union. In the Lai Gaojia Tou Village Branch of Wen'an County, Hebei Province, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association members took the lead in this movement, creating a signature craze throughout the village. The village's Sino-Soviet Friendship Association absorbed 32 members in this movement, and many other villages in Wen'an County also developed members and established Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organizations in conjunction with this movement.

D. Development of Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in various regions

    Due to the growing influence of Sino-Soviet friendship, learning from the Soviet Union, and the work of the Friendship Association, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organizations in various regions have also developed rapidly. In addition to the Northeast General Branch established a year ago, the Central South General Branch was established in early July. The national large cities and industrial centers directly under the Central Government and the large administrative regions, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, Shenyang, Lushun-Dalian, Fushun, Anshan, Benxi, and other places have established branches. Those that have established provincial or equivalent provincial branches are Liaodong, Liaoxi, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Rehe, Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, Chahar, Suiyuan, Subei, Sunan, Wanbei, Wannan, Zhejiang, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, and other places. The cities in the regions where the provincial branch associations are being prepared are Harbin, Jinan, Qingdao, Xuzhou, Dezhou, Weifang, Fuzhou, Changsha, Hengyang, Xiangtan, Nanning, Guilin, Liuzhou, Shantou, Chengdu, Lanzhou, Baoji, Yulin, and other places have also established Friendship Association organizations. With the establishment of organizations in various places, the number of members nationwide has also increased rapidly. According to the materials received, the number of members nationwide has increased from 700,000 in October last year to 3,041,262 today.

    Over the past year, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations across the country have done the above-mentioned work, which has played a huge role in consolidating and developing the great friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. However, we still have many shortcomings in our work, such as closed-doorism in developing members, formalism in our work, we have not done enough to introduce the struggles and construction achievements of our people to the Soviet people, and some places and some departments do not pay enough attention to this work, and so on. In the coming year, we must greatly develop our membership, greatly strengthen the specific and in-depth propaganda and education work on Sino-Soviet friendship and learning from the Soviet Union, greatly strengthen the work of introducing the new China to the Soviet people, and greatly strengthen the close ties between workers, peasants, youth, women, children, and intellectuals of China and the Soviet Union. The friendly cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union is not only a major guarantee for the successful construction of the new China, but also a strong bulwark for defending world peace. Chairman Mao instructed us, "The unity of the Chinese and Soviet peoples is extremely important. If the peoples of these two countries are united, the unity of the peoples of the world will not be difficult." As everyone knows, if the people of the world are united, any conspiracy of the aggressors will be shattered, and imperialism will surely collapse. We believe that the Chinese people will definitely fully realize Chairman Mao's great call.

    Long live the eternal friendly cooperation between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union!
    Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people!
    Long live Marshal Stalin, the great leader and teacher of the progressive humanity of the world!

　　中苏友好协会一年工作报告
    （一九四九年十月——一九五○年九月）
    一九四九年十月五日中苏友好协会总会正式成立。一年以来在国内外形势胜利发展的影响下，在本会会长和理事会的领导下，在各方赞助和苏联对外文化协会的帮助下，在各地中苏友好协会工作同志的积极努力下，全国大部省份和绝大部分中等以上城市已纷纷成立了中苏友协组织、展开了蓬蓬勃勃的中苏友协工作，获得了巨大的成绩，大大地教育了中国人民。现在中苏友协已经成为拥有三百多万会员的庞大的群众团体了。兹值总会成立周年之际，特将一年来全国中苏友协工作简要报告如次：
  甲、广泛地展开中苏友好、学习苏联的运动。
    自去年七月总会开始筹备以来，即用很大力量号召全国人民展开中苏友好与学习苏联的工作。经过总会的正式成立，欢迎苏联文化、艺术、科学工作者代表团，纪念十月革命三十二周年，庆祝斯大林七十寿辰，以至庆祝中苏新约等几大全国性的群众活动，中苏友好、学习苏联、开展中苏友好协会的工作，已在中国人民中发生了深刻的影响，对以后友协工作的开展和继续前进打下了初步基础。
    根据部分材料表明：仅欢迎苏联文化、艺术、科学工作者代表团，庆祝十月革命三十二周年和庆祝斯大林七十寿辰三次全国性的群众活动中，只就四十五个城市的统计，曾有二百八十六万九千六百余人参加（实际参加的全体人数，当远较此为多）。这些活动的范围遍及全国大、中城市和一部分小城市及某些农村。至于庆祝中苏新约运动，范围更广。在这些运动中，主要是采取了群众集会、讲演、座谈、游行等方式，并运用街头宣传、化装演出、游艺晚会、列车宣传、快板、鼓词、洋片、图书宣传等等办法。
    很明显的，中国人民只有在一旦扫除了反动派的统治，获得了自由表达自己心意的时候，才有可能表示出如此巨大规模的深厚的对苏友情。
  乙、逐渐深入具体地介绍苏联社会生活、文化、科学的各方面
    今年初，总会提出要突破一般号召和纪念庆祝，建立中苏友好，学习苏联的经常工作。于是各地中苏友协工作亦从大规模的号召，逐渐转向深入，根据自己的力量，进行关于苏联的各方面的介绍，用这些办法建立各级友协的经常工作。一年以来，总会及各地主要进行了以下的经常工作：
    （１）出版书刊。总会及各地在过去一年中，曾出版期刊三十八种。计册子型二十一种，报纸型五种，一般报纸的副刊十二种；以性质来分，纯友协业务性的会内刊物二种，俄语刊物一种，画刊二种；其余都是一般介绍苏联和业务报道的综合性的刊物。其中以总会的《中苏友好》，东北的《苏联介绍》，旅大的《友谊》，武汉的《益友》，上海的《苏联知识》等内容较为充实，发行份数较多，范围较广。报纸型的期刊中，以东北的《东北中苏友好》，北京的《北京友协》，察哈尔的《中苏友好》发行份数较多。其中《东北中苏友好》通俗简练适合广大会员要求。现每期发行三万五千余份，已深入中苏友协会员小组，并经常组织他们学习，指导性很强。除一般报纸的副刊不计外，据统计以上二十六种期刊中的十九种，一年来发行总份数为一、○九四、五○○份。
    另总会及各地一年来还出版了许多介绍苏联的单行本，据不完整的材料，共计一○八种（包括丛书、小册子在内）。其中以总会出的《米丘林生物学原理》、《斯大林论中国革命》、《斯大林的生平与学说》、《马卡伦科的生平及其教育学说》、《苏联文化、艺术工作者代表团在中国一月》与《遗传与变异》等版本较大。各地出的许多小丛书和通俗的适合一定时期的宣传教育中心的小册子，有不少已在广大群众中起了很大教育作用。
    为了予我们出版研究工作以方便，苏联对外文化协会一年来曾分赠总会书籍六、五六九册，小册子一、○七五册、杂志一六四种（一一、一八五册），报纸十五种。
    （２）电影工作。电影工作虽受设备器材限制甚大，但由于群众的热烈要求和拥护，经多方努力，亦做了很多工作。过去一年中，总会及北京、旅大、热河、上海等分会自带放映机分至所属地区巡回放映，博得群众热烈欢迎。计总会一年来在二十五个市、县、蒙旗中放映五九一场，使一、七一八、二六○名观众看到了苏联影片。其中有远至数十里外赶着大车到了放映地点等了三天才看到苏联影片的农民。在深入蒙旗工作中，则有不少是从数百里外来的蒙民，破天荒的看到了苏联电影。其次旅大、热河、青岛、兰州、哈尔滨等分、支会自行经营电影院，经常放映苏联及中国的进步影片，廉价优待或免费招待会员与非会员观众。有的并从这些影院的经营中补助了一部分经费的收入。至于以分支会出名，与所在地影院接洽，在放映苏联影片时使会员群众能享受一定折扣优待而看电影的则更多。据现有材料旅大、北京、开封、江西、杭州、天津、西安、上海、兰州等分、支会均已采用了此办法。此外，总会复与中央电影局商洽，在他们的协助之下，已代各分、支会购置放映机器，开始组成五十四个放映队，拟分布全国各地巡回放映，现已在南京训练放映技术人员，至十一月即可开始工作。这十四个放映队开始工作后，各地中苏友协的放映事业将大大增强。
    在电影工作中，东北条件较好，工作亦多。计东北一年来不完全的统计，只电影晚会即放映八六八部影片，使二、二九九、九○四名观众看到了苏联影片。
    （３）图片展览。总会一年来曾分至二十四个市、县、蒙旗举办苏联图片的巡回展览。仅本年一月至八月即有观众一、四○七、○一○人。察哈尔、河北、绥远等省亦已实行了巡回展览的办法，计察省展览十五回以上，遍达八县市，观众二十三万人；河北展览六回，其中三回即有观众一一五、九○○人。至于各分、支会自行在市区内举办展览会者则更多。据二十五个省、市统计，一年来举办展览会一、○二九次，观众达六、六八○、一八七人。其中仅上海在十一个月中即展览一四○次，计观众二、三五九、四八九人。为了大量推广图片展览，总会于本年四月即试验订阅苏联画报，分别剪贴裱糊使成适于展览用之图片，寄发各地，协助他们举办图片展览。结果举办轻易而收效甚大。现许多地方友协在总会协助下，已订阅苏联画报、剪制为图片开始展览。
    （４）邀请苏联学者来华讲学。自本年三月以来，应总会之邀，来我国讲学之苏联专家先后已有努日金、吉谢列夫、马卡洛娃、包德列夫、车斯诺柯夫，阿斯凯洛夫、尤金等七人，计在我国主要城市讲演座谈二○九次，听众二二五、二三三人。这对我国文化学术财经建设方面帮助极大，受到热烈欢迎。（⑴⑶）
    （５）举办讲演、座谈、广播及其他文化活动。在中苏友好、学习苏联的各种专题下，许多地区的中苏友协一年来曾定期的与不定期的举办了各种讲演、集会、讲座次数甚多。据上海、北京等十二个地区的统计，已举办四七七次，参加者一、八三三、○三七人。另外有些分支会如北京、郑州、青岛、河北、秦皇岛等还创办了《中苏友好》或《苏联介绍》等广播收效亦大。此外还采取幻灯、洋片、屋顶广播、文化棚、中苏友好论文比赛，苏联舞蹈训练班、苏联之窗或友协之窗、秧歌短剧、鼓词、相声等等形式。
    （６）国外联络工作。总会一年来曾与苏联对外文化协会、各人民民主国家及某些资本主义国家的对苏协会建立与保持了联系，并分别赠送新中国文化艺术作品多种，借资将新中国情况介绍于国外。计赠送苏联对外文化协会新中国唱片三十四种，赠送苏联、波兰、捷克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、朝鲜、保加利亚、德国、美国、英国、法国、日本及加拿大等十三国对苏友好协会或其他人民团体图书杂志画刊等一、八一四册，鲁迅全集、中国人民文艺丛书等书籍共三百五十六册。
    本年四月以来，苏联小朋友们不断寄来大批“致中国小朋友的信”本会已刊登于《中苏友好》或地方报纸，或用其他办法转送中国广大的小学生。经过本会号召发动，各地小学生先后送来本会“致苏联小朋友的信”共四、五六六封，已转送苏联。
    此外，复与文化部协同代苏联科学院创办之民主中国馆征集中国照片、杂志、图书、实物、资料等三一一五件，现正整理编译。一俟整理完毕即运送出国展览。
    此外，本会并会同文化部、文联、及其他文化团体代苏联对外文化协会征集普希金、高尔基在中国的各种资料，现已收集到一部转送苏联。
    （７）业余俄文教育。鉴于各地群众学习俄文已成热潮，总会及各地许多分、支会均创设俄文夜校，开展俄文业余教育。总会之俄文夜校现已招生两期，共有学生五四○人。另根据不完全统计，全国共有二十八个中苏友协分支会，办有俄文夜校或俄文补习班，参加学习的人数，共有六、一八九名，总会主办的夜校已编印出讲义六种、其中二种并已开始对外发售。
    开展俄文业余教育之另一个办法是创办俄语广播。全国现有东北总分会、北京、山西、浙江等分会已创办了这种俄语广播。他们多每周播讲二、三次，收听人数现有约一万四千五百人。
  丙、配合各人民团体积极推进保卫世界和平的签名运动
    本年四月，本会副总干事萧三同志参加全世界拥护和平大会第三次常设委员会归来，中国和大即决定响应斯德哥尔摩会议号召，在中国广泛的展开保卫世界和平的宣传运动和签名运动。各全国性的人民团体、民主党派纷纷响应，并号召自己的地方组织积极支持、赞助、参加这一运动。总会则于五月十一、十七两日两度向各分支会发出指示，号召各地中苏友协积极的协同各人民团体推进这一运动。为推动和检查各地运动之前进，本会副总干事萧三、赵仲池两同志复参加了中国保卫世界和平宣传团，由和大派赵华东、中南、西北三大行政区之主要城市做了四十日之旅行讲演。六月二十九日总会又通知各地要把签名运动继续贯彻并深入农村。
    根据总会指示：各地中苏友协分支会均已积极的配合着发动了这一运动，许多地区的中苏友协并把推动这一运动看做是自己在一定时期的中心工作。许多会员则成了这一运动中的宣传员和积极分子。
    各地中苏友协在这一运动中，大都参与了当地和平签名的领导工作，及具体组织工作，并在中苏友协系统动员自己的组织、会员和干部积极参加配合，并组织了宣传队，编印出版宣传品深入各方宣传，北京中苏友协各支会组织宣传队、宣传车、出刊了大字报、黑板报、街头壁报。沈阳中苏友协动员十五个中学内的六十名同学组成表演、讲演、签名访问的宣传队深入市民宣传。察北中苏友协首先在张北城内各中、小学组织了宣传小组和秧歌队，进行街头讲演宣传。西安中苏友协则协同西安和大出刊《和平之友》（报纸副刊）进行宣传。
    为配合这一运动，许多地方的中苏友协举办了集会、图展，公开设站征求签名。北京中苏友协在多种场所、各街道广设签名站，鞍山特地举办图展配合签名，并在图展室内设签名站，三天内即有二千多人签了名。
    在中苏友协干部、会员积极推进保卫世界和平的宣传与签名运动中，出现了出色的模范事例。北京中苏友协女会员五十一岁的高玉泉、五十五岁的张杨氏，五天之内发动了八、二三四人签名。北京二区女会员任淑华在一天中即发动了一千五百多人签了名。西安郊区岳家寨十六岁之女会员王玉芩积极宣传几天工夫即征求了三百多人签名。
    由于各地中苏友协采取了配合这一运动开展中苏友协工作的办法，所以随着这一运动的开展，中苏友协的工作也开展了。许多场合常有一边签名、一边报名要求参加中苏友好协会的情况，锦州群众在听到中苏友协宣传员的宣传解释之后，纷纷反映，中苏友好，还可保卫世界和平，我要签名还要入会（友协）。唐山中苏友协在这一运动中发展了会员一万五千名，济南市中苏友协通过和平签名运动发展了会员五千七百多人，并建立了分局党校，省干校，店员工会等六个支分会。河北省文安县赖高贾头村支分会在这一运动中，由于中苏友协会员积极带头，造成全村签名热潮。该村中苏友协在这一运动中吸收会员三十二名，文安县其他许多村庄也结合这一运动发展了会员建立了中苏友协组织。
  丁、各地中苏友协的发展
    由于中苏友好、学习苏联和友协工作的影响之增长，各地中苏友协组织也随着迅速发展起来。除一年前已建立了东北总分会外，七月初又建立了中南总分会。直属于中央及大行政区的全国大城市和工业中心北京、天津、上海、南京、武汉、广州、重庆、西安、沈阳、旅大、抚顺、鞍山、本溪等地均已建立分会。省或相当于省的分会建立者为辽东、辽西、黑龙江、吉林、热河、河北、山西、平原、察哈尔、绥远、苏北、苏南、皖北、皖南、浙江、河南、湖北、江西、陕西、宁夏、新疆、云南、贵州、内蒙等地。正在筹建中的省分会则有山东、松江。尚未建立省分会地区之城市哈尔滨、济南、青岛、徐州、德州、潍坊、福州、长沙、衡阳、湘潭、南宁、桂林、柳州、汕头、成都、兰州、宝鸡、榆林等亦已建立友协组织。随着各地组织的建立，全国会员亦已迅速的增长。根据已收到的材料统计，全国会员已自去年十月的七十万人增加到今天的三百零四万一千二百六十二人。
    一年来，全国的中苏友协做了上述的工作，这对于中苏两国人民的伟大友谊的巩固和发展是起了巨大作用的。但我们在工作中还有许多缺点，如发展会员中的关门主义，工作中的形式主义，我们向苏联人民介绍我国人民的斗争和建设成就作得还很不够，以及某些地方和某些部门对这一工作还不够重视等等。我们在今后一年内还必须大大地发展我们的会员，大大地加强具体和深入关于中苏友好与学习苏联的宣传教育工作，大大地加强向苏联人民介绍新中国的工作，并将大大地加强中苏两国工人、农民、青年、妇女、儿童和知识分子间的亲密联系。中苏两大民族的友好合作，不单单是新中国建设胜利进行的重大保证，而且是保卫世界和平的坚强堡垒。毛主席指示我们，“中苏两国人民的团结极为重要，这两国人民团结一致了，世界人民的团结就不困难了。”大家知道，全世界人民团结一致了，侵略者的任何阴谋就一定被粉碎，帝国主义就一定会垮台。我们相信，中国人民是一定会完满地实现毛主席的伟大号召的。
    中苏两国人民永恒的友好合作万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
    全世界进步人类的伟大领袖和导师斯大林大元帅万岁！
