New Book and Periodical Introductions

 *New Observer*, Issue 7
The seventh issue of the first volume of *New Observer* is a special enlarged edition to celebrate National Day and the opening of the National Congress of Combat Heroes and Model Workers. In the special issue commemorating National Day, Wu Lengxi's "A Year of Great Achievements" narrates the great achievements of the past year since the founding of the country from five aspects: military, political, economic, cultural, and diplomatic. There are also articles by Mr. Jian Bozan, Lou Bangyan, Pan Guangdan, Feng Youlan, Yang Ren, Liang Shuming, and others, as well as recollections of the past year from workers, women, Beijing citizens, and people from all walks of life. There are also Bai Sheng's "How the People of the Capital Greet National Day" and Xiao Feng's "The Brand New Beijingers," which show a new face of the people of the capital.

The special issue introducing heroes and role models includes two comprehensive reports, one introducing several heroic figures from the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army, and the other introducing labor models in agricultural production in the Northeast. Individual introductions include five articles: "*Special-Class Combat Heroine Guo Junqing*," "*Liu Yingyuan at Work*," "*Model Engineer Yu Songru*," "*Labor Model He Shigu of the Ordnance Industry*," and "*Labor Model Pan Changyou*."

In addition, there is an article recording the atrocities of American aircraft slaughtering our compatriots, "*Blood and Tears of Hatred on the Yalu River*," and two articles reporting on the major achievements of our country's water control work in the past year. The two columns, "Current Affairs Explanation" and "News Notes," also provide concise records and discussions of current important affairs. The pictorial has eight pages, with more than twenty pictures.

*"Chinese Young Pioneers"*, Issue 24
Issue 24 of *Chinese Young Pioneers* was published on September 30th. This issue contains "That Day, October 1st" written by Mr. Jiang Shanye, which tells the story of children loving National Day and Chairman Mao, lively and interesting; other main contents include: "Green Family" translated by Ding Anyi, which tells the story of Soviet Michurinists transforming nature; "Let Flowers and Plants Overwinter with Us" written by Gao Zhuang, teaching children how to make specimens; "Brave Little Soldier" written by the writer Ma Feng, which is a story about a young guerrilla he encountered when he visited Korea. The story tells very clearly and vividly how this sixteen-year-old child joined the guerrillas and how he bravely and resourcefully attacked the enemy in the guerrillas. The "Team Life" column has "I'll Carry You on My Back Because You Have No Shoes!" written by Ren Dalin, which tells the story of a rural primary school in Hangxian County where children did not have rubber shoes. On rainy days, the Young Pioneers launched older students to carry younger students to school, thus ensuring that the school's learning would not be interrupted. *Red Scarves Dedicated to the People's Liberation Army* by Jin Keqin is about the meeting between children in Xi'an and combat hero Lü Shunbao and others. *Forty-five Thousand Miles Travelogue* and *Gray-Necked Duck Comic Strip* continue to be published in this issue, and there are also many children's articles and drawings.
