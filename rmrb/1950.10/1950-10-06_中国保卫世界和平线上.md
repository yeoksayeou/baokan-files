　　Shi Zhengxian, a military dependent woman from Fangguiji Village, Eleventh District, Dan County, Pingyuan Province, was allocated six mu of land after the land reform. Through her hard work, her life has improved. During this peace signature campaign, she not only signed her name first but also mobilized others to sign. She said, "For the past few years, we have been living in deep misery. This place has had no harvest for five or six years in a row, and it was also a disaster area last year. Life was very hard. This year, Chairman Mao called on the whole country to increase production, and the crops have been bountiful. However, the American devils want to make trouble. We are not afraid of them. If they come, we will fight them to the end."

　　The Jinzhou Train Section established peace work groups in various trains starting from August 23rd. They used broadcasting and oral propaganda to promote the significance of defending world peace to passengers and mobilized passengers to sign their names. Within two weeks, they collected over 12,000 signatures. Due to the efforts of the peace work groups and their sincere attitude during the propaganda, many passengers were moved. An old fellow villager, Zhao Jingbo, who traveled on train 159, even sent a letter from Qiqihar on August 28th to commend their enthusiastic work and contribution to peace.

　　Wang Ziliang, Yu Youlu, and 13 other residents of Sangshuwang, Jinping District, Chongxin County, Gansu, specially traveled from their mountain village 15 li away to the county town to sign their names. They said, "In the past, the Japanese devils invaded China, but they were defeated by the Chinese people. Today, if American imperialism dares to invade us, we will eliminate them like we defeated the Japanese devils. After we sign our names, we will go back to publicize the crimes of American imperialist aggression and expose that the atomic bomb is not scary. We should all work hard in production, eliminate bandits, and support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, using practical actions to defend world peace."
　　Wang Guian, the imam of the Qingzhen Mosque in the county town of Miyun County, Hebei, not only signed his name but also mobilized all the Hui people in the city to sign. He also wrote letters to the Hui people in Shixia and Mujia峪 to mobilize them to sign.
