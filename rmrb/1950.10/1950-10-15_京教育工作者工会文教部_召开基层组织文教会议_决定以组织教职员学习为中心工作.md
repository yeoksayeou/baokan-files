　　Beijing Education Workers' Union Cultural and Educational Department
    Convenes Grassroots Organization Cultural and Educational Meeting
    Decides to Center Work on Organizing Teachers and Staff to Study
    [This newspaper's dispatch] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency: The Cultural and Educational Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Education Workers' Union, held its first cultural and educational work meeting of the primary and secondary school grassroots committees this semester on the afternoon of the 7th of this month. One hundred and twenty cultural and educational work committee members from various grassroots organizations attended. The meeting summarized the political and professional studies of primary and secondary school teachers and staff and the cultural and political studies of workers in the first half of 1950; reported on the handling of cultural and educational work proposals from the municipal education workers' union representative assembly; and adopted a resolution on the cultural and educational work of primary and secondary school grassroots committees for this semester. The meeting resolved that organizing teachers and staff to study should be the central work of the union in the future, and that cultural and educational committee members should participate in academic committees at all levels, with a clear division of labor within the academic committees. On the basis of members' voluntary participation, efforts should be made to encourage and specifically assist members in their studies, exchange experiences, and commend achievements through various methods to enhance and consolidate the enthusiasm for study. At the same time, active efforts should be made to ensure the completion of various study tasks, eliminating the past phenomenon that study was generally led by the administration, leaving the union with nothing to do, or that the union would take over the study work entirely. In addition, the union should attach importance to and carry out cultural and political studies for worker members, and appropriately carry out cultural, recreational, and sports activities in conjunction with members' work and study.
