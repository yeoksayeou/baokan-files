　　Learn from Comrade Bi Shi's Example and Resolutely Struggle Against Imperialism
    Zhang Dingcheng
    Upon hearing the tragic news of the passing of Comrade Ren Bishi, member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee, the entire party, army, and revolutionary people of Fujian are in deep mourning! Just as we were relying on Comrade Ren Bishi, the people's warrior and people's statesman, to assist Chairman Mao in leading and guiding us to fight against the aggression of U.S. imperialism, consolidate the national defense of the people's motherland, and continue to develop the people's revolutionary struggle and people's construction cause, Comrade Ren Bishi departed from us, which is an incomparable and enormous loss!
    Comrade Ren Bishi dedicated all his spirit, strength, and wisdom to the cause of our Party, the cause of our working class, and the cause of our people's liberation, until the glorious and great victory of the liberation of all China was achieved. His great achievements will be forever remembered by the entire Party, the entire army, and all revolutionary people.
    Comrade Ren Bishi has passed away. We are deeply saddened. At present, many ethnic groups and countries in Asia are still under the aggression of U.S. imperialism, and our neighboring Democratic People's Republic of Korea is suffering from the ravages of the aggressive war by U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. U.S. imperialism is also invading our China's Taiwan and infringing upon our national defense. At a time when such vicious enemies are attacking us, our entire Party, army, and all revolutionary comrades should learn from Comrade Ren Bishi's great spirit and great creative wisdom for the nation, the country, and the people, and strive to fight against the aggression of U.S. imperialism, consolidate the national defense of the people's motherland, and continue to develop the people's revolutionary struggle and the cause of people's construction!
    We should learn from Comrade Ren Bishi's example of boundless loyalty to the cause of the Party, the cause of the working class, and the cause of the people. Comrade Ren Bishi led the people's army in revolutionary wars for a long time, fighting against imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and mastered military art, achieving victories in eliminating the enemy and developing ourselves in the land revolutionary war, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Liberation War. Comrade Ren Bishi led cadres and the people for a long time in arduous struggles against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism; and mastered correct policies and the art of struggle, achieving victories in defeating the dark forces and developing ourselves in the land reform movement, the workers' movement, and the youth movement. Comrade Ren Bishi terrified the dark rulers of imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. They arrested and cruelly tortured our Comrade Ren Bishi, but Comrade Ren Bishi demonstrated the lofty integrity of a Communist. Comrade Ren Bishi's unwavering loyalty, wholehearted service to the people, and great spirit of "cannot be corrupted by wealth, cannot be moved by poverty, and cannot be subdued by force" led to the victorious development of the revolutionary cause. This is what all our Party comrades and all revolutionary comrades should learn.
    We should learn from Comrade Ren Bishi's example of adhering to the truth of Marxism-Leninism, adhering to Mao Zedong Thought, and adhering to the Party's correct line and policies. Comrade Ren Bishi demonstrated a Bolshevik firm spirit in the construction of the Chinese Communist Party and in grasping the Party's line and policies. When Chen Duxiu's opportunism occurred in the Party, Comrade Ren Bishi led the Youth League to fight against this opportunist line and actively supported the Party's revolutionary line; when Zhang Guotao's opportunism occurred in the Party, Comrade Ren Bishi, together with Comrade Zhu De and many other comrades, fought against Zhang Guotao's opportunist line. Comrade Ren Bishi's great spirit of fighting for the construction of the Party and for the Bolshevikization of the Party is what all our Party cadres should learn. We should inherit Comrade Ren Bishi's legacy and great spirit, and call on all Communist Party members, all revolutionary comrades, and all soldiers and civilians in Fujian to unite as one, actively prepare for the war to liberate Jinmen and Taiwan, actively oppose the aggression of U.S. imperialism, consolidate our national defense, eliminate bandits and secret agents, stabilize social order, and enable the people to live and work in peace and contentment. We must actively carry out the struggle to eliminate feudalism, launch a rent reduction movement, and implement land reform in areas where conditions are ripe. We must actively carry out industrial and agricultural production and commerce, and develop cultural and educational work. We should commemorate Comrade Ren Bishi with practical actions and with the victorious development of the revolutionary cause and the cause of the people.
    The great warrior and statesman of the Chinese people, Comrade Ren Bishi, will be immortal!

　　学习弼时同志的榜样与帝国主义坚决斗争
    张鼎丞
    惊闻我们中共中央委员、中央政治局委员和中央书记处书记任弼时同志逝世的讣音，我福建全党、全军和全体革命人民万分悲悼！我们正在仰赖人民的战士和人民的政治家任弼时同志协助毛主席率领我们教导我们，为反对美帝国主义的侵略，巩固人民祖国的国防，继续发展人民革命斗争和人民建设事业而奋斗的时候，而任弼时同志离开我们而逝世了，这是难以比拟的巨大损失！
    任弼时同志一生的全部精神、力量和智慧，都贡献给了我们党的事业，我们工人阶级的事业，我们人民解放的事业，一直得到了全中国解放的光荣伟大的胜利。其丰功伟绩，是全党、全军和全体革命人民永远纪念着的。
    任弼时同志逝世了。我们是十分悲痛的。现在我们亚洲许多民族、国家，仍然处在被美帝国主义侵略之中，我们邻邦朝鲜民主主义人民共和国正处在美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚匪帮侵略战争的摧残之中。美帝国主义也侵略我们中国的台湾和侵害着我国国防。在这种穷凶极恶的敌人向我们进攻的时候，我全党、全军和所有革命同志都应该学习任弼时同志为民族、为国家、为人民的伟大精神和伟大创造智慧，为反对美帝国主义的侵略，巩固人民祖国的国防，继续发展人民革命斗争和人民建设事业而奋斗！
    我们应该学习任弼时同志对于党的事业，对于工人阶级的事业，对于人民的事业抱无限忠诚的榜样。任弼时同志是长期在革命战争中率领着人民军队对帝国主义及其走狗蒋匪帮作战的，并掌握了军事艺术，在土地革命战争中、抗日战争和解放战争中，消灭敌人发展自己的胜利的。任弼时同志是长期率领着干部和人民，对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义进行艰苦卓绝的斗争的；并掌握了正确的政策和斗争的艺术，在土地改革运动、工人运动和青年运动中，打倒黑暗势力发展自己的胜利的。任弼时同志使帝国主义及其走狗蒋匪帮的黑暗统治者心惊胆寒。它们并逮捕和残刑拷打了我们的任弼时同志，而任弼时同志表现了共产党人崇高的气节。任弼时同志的赤胆忠心，全心全意为人民服务，“富贵不能淫，贫贱不能移，威武不能屈”的伟大精神，使革命事业胜利发展。这是我们全党同志和所有革命同志应该学习的。
    我们应该学习任弼时同志坚持马列主义真理，坚持毛泽东思想，坚持党的正确路线、政策的榜样。任弼时同志对于中国共产党的建设上，对于掌握党的路线政策上，都表现了布尔什维克坚定的精神。在党内发生陈独秀机会主义的时候，任弼时同志领导青年团与这个机会主义路线进行斗争，积极拥护党的革命路线；党内发生张国焘机会主义的时候，任弼时同志与朱德同志及其他许多同志一起，进行反对张国焘机会主义路线的斗争。任弼时同志为党的建设，为党的布尔什维克化而斗争的伟大精神，是我们全体党员干部应该学习的。我们应该秉承着任弼时同志的遗教和伟大精神，号召我们福建的全体共产党员、全体革命同志、全体军民一致团结起来，积极进行解放金门、解放台湾战争的准备工作，积极反对美帝国主义的侵略，巩固我们的国防，消灭土匪特务，安定社会秩序，使人民安居乐业。我们要积极进行消灭封建主义的斗争，开展减租运动，在条件成熟的地区，实行土地改革。我们要积极进行工农商业的生产，建设并开展文化教育等项工作。我们应该以实际行动，以革命的事业，人民的事业的胜利发展来纪念任弼时同志。
    中国人民的伟大战士和政治家任弼时同志永垂不朽！
