　　Labor-Management Relations in New China Gradually Return to Normal
    In the year since the founding of the People's Republic of China, due to the people's government's implementation of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which stipulates "developing production, benefiting both labor and capital," labor-management relations in private enterprises in various regions have gradually moved towards normalcy from the somewhat chaotic and unstable state of the early post-liberation period. Over the past year, the implementation of the policy of "developing production, benefiting both labor and capital" has been achieved through the following specific organizational work: the people's governments established labor bureaus, which became unified agencies for handling labor-management disputes; and adopted methods of signing labor-management collective contracts and establishing labor-management consultation meetings to democratically, equally, and uniformly resolve labor-management disputes and improve labor-management relations in various industries and factories.

    Mediating Disputes, Signing Collective Contracts, Improving Labor-Management Relations.

    In the early days of liberation, many labor-management disputes occurred in various regions. This was because during the Kuomintang rule, many capitalists had oppressed and excessively exploited workers, and after liberation, they were worried about retaliation from workers and hesitated to resume work and production, which aroused opposition from workers. On the other hand, some workers, focusing only on immediate interests and even misunderstanding the meaning of liberation, put forward some demands that were too high under the circumstances at the time, and there was a phenomenon of lax labor discipline. In addition, the local governments at the time did not have specialized agencies responsible for handling labor-management issues, nor did they have unified methods and procedures for resolving disputes, so some coercion and stalemate phenomena occurred between labor and management. In response to this situation, the people's political power organs in Shanghai, Northeast China, Tianjin, Wuhan, Beijing, Nanjing, and other places successively promulgated several important documents. Based on the principles of restoring and developing production and benefiting both labor and capital, they set out correct solutions to the problems in labor-management disputes in various regions at the time. These documents are the three major documents published by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in November last year, which were recommended by local trade unions to local people's governments for adoption: "Provisional Measures for Handling Labor-Management Relations," "Provisional Measures for Labor-Management Parties in Private Industrial and Commercial Enterprises to Sign Collective Contracts," and "Provisional Measures for Procedures for Resolving Labor Disputes." The three major documents mainly put forward the following points: 1. The labor bureau of the municipal people's government is the organ for mediating and arbitrating all labor-management disputes. 2. The procedures and steps for handling labor-management disputes are: first, labor and management should negotiate and resolve the disputes themselves. If they cannot be resolved, they should apply to the labor bureau for mediation and arbitration. If one party is still dissatisfied after arbitration, they can file a lawsuit in court, and the court will make a judgment. 3. Labor and management can sign collective contracts through consultation to resolve disputes and stabilize the relationship between the two parties. In addition, the above documents also generally stipulate the rights and obligations of labor and management in enterprises, as well as the principles and procedures for starting work, suspending business, employment, and dismissal. After these measures were adopted and implemented by local people's governments, labor-management relations in various regions gradually returned to normal. By March of this year, labor and management in 91 large and medium-sized cities across the country had signed a total of 404 collective contracts. These contracts played a significant role in resolving labor-management disputes at the time. For example, after the Beijing National Pharmaceutical Industry signed a labor-management collective contract to uniformly resolve issues such as wages, benefits, and labor discipline, labor-management relations were greatly improved, and production was also improved.

    Establishing Labor-Management Consultation Meetings, Adjusting Labor-Management Relations, Improving Production.

    The difficulties in production stagnation and unsalable products that occurred in many industrial and commercial enterprises in March and April once again strained the labor-management relations that had stabilized before March. During this period, in addition to the central people's government vigorously adjusting public-private relations and assisting private enterprises that were beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood to overcome difficulties, the Ministry of Labor of the central people's government convened a national labor bureau chiefs' meeting in March to study in detail the "Instructions on Establishing Labor-Management Consultation Meetings in Private Enterprises" drafted by the ministry and published it on April 30. This instruction clearly stipulates that labor-management consultation meetings are organs for equal consultation between labor and management; the main content of the consultation meetings is to study and discuss the formulation of production plans and how to improve output and quality, and save materials. This clearly affirmed that adjusting labor-management relations should focus on improving production. At the same time, workers in private enterprises in various regions, under the call of trade unions, also took the initiative to unite with capitalists, overcome temporary difficulties, voluntarily reduce wages and benefits, and actively suggested that capitalists improve business management. During this period, labor-management consultation meetings were generally established in various regions. According to incomplete statistics, by June, a total of 923 labor-management consultation meetings had been established in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Jinan, and other places, of which 270 belonged to industrial or trade labor-management consultation meetings. Due to the relatively widespread establishment of labor-management consultation meetings, labor and management had frequent opportunities for consultation, which not only broke the past stalemate of mutual distrust, but also turned the labor-management relations, which had been strained in March and April, to normal in late May. Moreover, labor-management consultation provided a good way to overcome difficulties at the time, enabling some very difficult but beneficial private enterprises to the national economy and people's livelihood to survive. For example, the Nanjing Yongli Alkali Plant established a labor-management consultation meeting, and labor and management, after several consultations, implemented several specific agreements on improving business management, which turned the plant's production from serious difficulties to a normal path. After the Tianjin Beiyang and Hengyuan cotton mills established labor-management consultation meetings, workers launched a red flag competition, which increased output month by month. The positive cloth rate of the Hengyuan Cotton Mill reached 98.7%, setting an unprecedented record for the plant. The Beijing Jingwei Weaving Factory, Shanghai Huafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and Meiya Silk Factory have established labor-management consultation meetings, improved management and production, and achieved break-even production from losses or serious difficulties, and have begun to have surpluses. Since June and July, with the beginning of the improvement in the production and sales of industry and commerce in various regions, labor-management relations have gradually stabilized. Based on these experiences, labor-management consultation meetings in various regions, with the help of labor bureaus and trade union organizations, have gradually shifted from simple consultation organs for resolving disputes to consultation organs where labor and management jointly strive to improve production. If labor and management in private enterprises in various regions can do this in accordance with this principle, then the organization of labor-management consultation meetings will play a greater role in restoring and developing the economy.

### 新中国的劳资关系已渐入常轨

　　新中国的劳资关系已渐入常轨
    在中华人民共和国诞生以来的一年中，由于人民政府执行了中国人民政协共同纲领所规定的“发展生产，劳资两利”的政策，各地私营企业的劳资关系，已从解放初期的多少是混乱的和不稳定的状态，逐步走上了常轨。一年以来，“发展生产，劳资两利”政策的贯彻执行，是通过以下的具体组织工作实现的，这就是人民政府设立了劳动局，成为统一处理劳资争议的机构；同时采用了以订立劳资集体合同和建立劳资协商会议的办法，来民主地、平等地并统一地解决各业各厂中的劳资争议事件和改善劳资关系。
    调解争议，签定集体合同，改善了劳资关系。
    各地在解放初期，都曾发生了比较多的劳资争议。因为在国民党统治时期，很多资本家曾压迫和过重剥削工人，解放后害怕工人报复而心存顾虑，拖延复工复业，引起工人反对。另一方面，也有一部分工人因只顾眼前利益，甚至误解解放的意义，提出了某些在当时情况下是过高的要求，并产生了劳动纪律松弛的现象，加以当时各地政府方面还没有专门负责处理劳资问题的主管机构，也没有规定解决争议的统一办法和手续，因此劳资间曾发生了若干胁迫、僵持等现象。针对这种情况，上海、东北、天津、武汉、北京、南京等地人民政权机构先后颁布了几个重要文件，依据恢复发展生产的方针和劳资两利的原则，对于当时各地劳资纠纷中的问题，定出了正确的解决办法。这些文件就是中华全国总工会在去年十一月公布经由各地总工会向各地人民政府建议采纳的三大文件：《关于劳资关系暂行处理办法》、《关于私营工商企业劳资双方订立集体合同的暂行办法》、《劳动争议解决程序的暂行办法》。三大文件主要提出了以下几点：一、市人民政府的劳动局为调解、仲裁一切劳资争议的机关。二、处理劳资争议的程序和步骤是：首先由劳资双方自行协商解决，如不能解决即申请劳动局调解、仲裁，如仲裁后仍有一方不服，可向法院起诉，由法院判决。三、劳资双方得经过协商，签定集体合同以解决争议并稳定双方关系。此外，上述文件还一般地规定了劳资双方在企业中的权利、义务，以及关于开工、歇业和雇佣、解雇等的原则和手续。这些办法经各地人民政府采纳实行后，各地劳资关系即逐步走上常轨。到今年三月为止，全国九十一个大、中城市中劳资双方共订立了集体合同四百零四个。这些合同在解决当时的劳资纠纷上都起了很大的作用。如北京国药业在签订劳资集体合同统一地解决了工资、福利和劳动纪律等问题以后，劳资关系得到很大改善，生产亦有了改进。
    建立劳资协商会议，调整劳资关系，搞好生产。
    今年三四月间不少工商业发生的停产滞销困难，又曾一度使三月以前已趋稳定的劳资关系紧张起来。在这期间除中央人民政府大力调整公私关系和扶助有利于国计民生的私营企业克服困难以外，中央人民政府劳动部曾在三月间召开全国劳动局长会议，详细研讨了该部所起草的《关于在私营企业中设立劳资协商会议的指示》，并在四月三十日将其公布。这个指示明确地规定劳资协商会议是劳资双方平等协商的机关；协商会议的主要内容是研究讨论生产计划的订定及如何提高产量、质量、节约材料等问题。这样就明确地肯定了调整劳资关系要以搞好生产为中心。与此同时，各地私营企业的工人在工会号召下，亦主动团结资方，克服暂时困难，自动降低工资待遇，积极地建议资方改善经营管理。在这期间，劳资协商会议就在各地普遍地建立起来了。据不完全统计，到六月为止，北京、天津、上海、武汉、广州、济南等地已共建立了九百二十三个劳资协商会议，其中有二百七十个是属于产业或行业性的劳资协商会议。由于劳资协商会议的比较广泛的建立，劳资双方就有了经常协商的机会，这不但打开了过去互不信任的僵局，使曾在三四月间一度紧张的劳资关系，在五月下旬开始转趋正常；而且经过劳资协商为当时克服困难提供了很好的方法，使某些非常困难的但是有利于国计民生的私营企业得以维持下来。如南京永利錏厂就因为建立了劳资协商会议，劳资双方经过多次协商，实施了关于改善经营管理的几项具体协议，使该厂生产从严重困难中转上了正常道路。天津北洋、恒源两大纱厂建立劳资协商会议后，工人开展了红旗竞赛运动，使产量逐月上升。恒源纱厂的正布率达到百分之九十八点七，创该厂空前纪录。北京经纬织布厂和上海华丰染织厂、美亚绸厂等则已因建立劳资协商会议，改善了经营和生产以后，从赔累或严重困难中达到了保本生产并进而开始有了盈余。自六七月以来，随着各地工商业产销情况的开始好转，劳资关系已渐趋稳定。根据这些经验，各地劳资协商会议在劳动局与工会组织的帮助下已逐渐从单纯解决争论的协商机关，转到劳资双方共同努力搞好生产的协商机关。如果各地私营企业的劳资双方都能本着这方针去做，那末，劳资协商会议的组织，还会在恢复和发展经济中，起更大的作用。
