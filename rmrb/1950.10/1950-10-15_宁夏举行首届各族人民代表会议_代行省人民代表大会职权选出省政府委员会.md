In the year since Ningxia's liberation, all thirteen counties, one city, and one town in the province have generally held two to three sessions of the People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups and All Circles. The 800,000 people of the province have been basically organized, laying the foundation for the convening of this conference.

　　There were 275 representatives of all ethnic groups and all circles attending the conference. The conference listened to and reviewed the report on the work of the Provincial People's Government over the past year, as well as its future guidelines and tasks. The attending representatives unanimously agreed that in the past year, the people's governments at all levels have united the people of all ethnic groups and all circles and have made great achievements in all aspects of work, particularly in suppressing bandits, developing production, and uniting all ethnic groups. Regarding the guidelines and tasks for future work, the conference believes that it is necessary to focus on the two central tasks of restoring and developing production and doing a good job in financial and economic work, further strengthening ethnic unity, eliminating bandits and special agents, stabilizing social order, practicing strict economy, and overcoming disasters. At present, it is even more important to do a good job in autumn grain collection, winter irrigation, and organizing the masses of peasants to engage in sideline production.
