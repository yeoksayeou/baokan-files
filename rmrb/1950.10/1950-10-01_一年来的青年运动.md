    The Youth Movement in the Past Year
    Feng Wenbin

    I.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China last year, China has entered a completely new historical era. In the past, we were destroying an old society. Now, in this new era, we must build a new society. We are faced with the new task of building a new society. Therefore, the China New Democratic Youth League, at its first National Congress last year, pointed out that the basic task of the League is to educate and cultivate the younger generation to actively participate in the construction of a new democratic society.

    The past year has fully proven that this policy is correct. Youth League members in various regions have generally played an active role in the country's various construction undertakings. The organization of the Youth League has greatly developed, and now has grown to over three million members. The role of the League has also become increasingly significant with the development of the League. At present, the Youth League has gradually become a powerful assistant to the People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, and has become the core force of the Chinese youth movement. The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation have also played a significant role in the youth and student movements of the past year.

    II.
    In production and construction, the active role of Youth League members and young people is often manifested in their ability to accept new things. The Central People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, in each period, put forward new calls and methods in response to the development of production and construction. Young people are vigorous and energetic, and often demonstrate great enthusiasm in responding to calls and implementing new methods. When launching the new record movement in factories, Youth League member Zhao Guoyou took the lead in setting new records. Encouraged by the Party and administration, he continuously reformed his production tools and technology, reducing the standard time for machining lathe head pulleys from an estimated sixteen hours to four hours. He then created new records of 2.20 minutes, 1.16 minutes, and 50 minutes for machining a single pulley. The Ministry of Railways promulgated the change from the rotation shift system to the contract shift system. Youth workers played a significant role in implementing this new system. In rural areas, some older farmers adhered to old habits and sometimes adopted a wait-and-see attitude towards the new scientific farming methods advocated by the People's Government, such as planting cotton, seed soaking, autumn tree planting, green manure composting, pest control, and well digging. Youth League members and young farmers were the most active advocates and participants in these calls. Female League members and young women changed the previous custom of women being unwilling to participate in agricultural production and actively participated in agricultural production themselves. Especially in various emergency actions such as Yellow River control and disaster relief, Youth League members and young people were always at the forefront.

    The shortcomings among young people in factories and rural areas are: a few young people do not pay enough attention to developing production by improving scientific production methods and mastering production technology. Also, some Youth League members and young activists often automatically and solely rely on working day and night to increase output, which affects their health and leads to a lack of sustainability. In the future, Youth League members and young people in factories and rural areas should, based on the characteristics and abilities of young people and together with the broad masses, conduct necessary but not excessive activities closely around production, and strengthen cultural, technical, and political learning. They should adopt a correct work attitude and use wisdom and scientific methods and technology to play their role in production.

    After the establishment of the Youth League in the army, soldiers in the companies where the League has been established generally showed positive behavior. League members and young people in government agencies also played an active role.

    III.
    Over the past year, regular New Democratic studies have been carried out in schools. In the provinces of Southwest and South China, which were newly liberated last year, students actively participated in takeover work and generally carried out preliminary enlightenment-style political and ideological education. Great achievements have been made in this regard. With the stabilization of social order and the normal commencement of classes in these newly liberated cities, students, like those in the old liberated areas, strengthened regular studies in schools. Over the past year, the enthusiasm for learning among students in schools has generally increased, and their political thinking has generally improved, especially among Youth League members, who generally studied hard, listened carefully in class, and carefully prepared and reviewed lessons outside of class. They also promoted the learning of general students through their exemplary behavior in learning.

    Some schools have also promoted regular coursework through extracurricular activities. For example, students in the Northeast manufactured teaching tools that were practically needed in teaching, and based on their personal interests and on a voluntary basis, established research groups organized by grade and subject. There were also activities that used entertainment to enhance knowledge, with learning as their content. In addition to the above, extracurricular activities also included social service activities, such as medical students in the Northeast and Beijing participating in the prevention of plague and other infectious diseases, and agricultural students going to the countryside to participate in the fight against crop diseases and insect pests.

    In the past year, some schools carried out so-called "ideological summaries" and "democratic appraisals," adopting overly hasty methods for ideological transformation. Some schools also experienced excessive coursework and activities, which resulted in impaired student health. This matter has recently been noticed by all parties. At present, in order to implement the New Democratic learning policy, in addition to the education departments trying to reform the school system, curriculum, and teaching methods, activities are being reduced, courses are being adjusted appropriately, scholarships and medical care are being increased, and physical education is being promoted.

    Cultural learning is being carried out among young people in factories and rural areas. Many factories have established workers' cultural evening schools, and many rural areas have long established winter schools, people's schools, literacy classes, etc. The vast majority of students in these learning organizations are young people. Youth League members actively support these learning organizations and play an exemplary role in learning.

    The People's Government has also established accelerated secondary schools for workers and peasants in various places. In Shanghai alone, 112 schools have been established, with 30,594 students. In January of this year, the Central People's Government also established a new type of regular Renmin University of China, where students from worker and peasant backgrounds account for 63% of the total student body. People's scholarships have been established in schools across the country to help solve the tuition fees for poor students.

    IV.
    Over the past year, patriotic and internationalist education has been widely carried out in the Youth League and among young people. This education is an important part of the Youth League's political and ideological education.

    This education is first carried out through practice. For example, in the celebration of the founding of the People's Republic of China last year, the May Day and May Fourth parades this year, the anti-American-made Chiang Kai-shek aircraft bombing movement in East China, and especially in the nationwide movement against American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Korea, young people actively participated and received great patriotic education. Activities such as the celebration of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the celebration of Marshal Stalin's 70th birthday, the visit of the Soviet youth delegation headed by Comrade Mikhailov to China, the visit of the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation to China, various international youth festival activities, and the speeches by Chinese representatives returning from youth conferences in the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, and especially the peace signature campaign, young people actively participated and received great internationalist education.

    Secondly, the Youth League publishes books and periodicals to carry out patriotic and internationalist education among young people. The central organ of the Youth League, the "China Youth" biweekly, is one of the most widely circulated publications in the country, with a circulation of 130,000 copies, and is a powerful tool for the Youth League to conduct political and ideological education. In addition, there is the Chinese version of the World Federation of Democratic Youth publication "World Youth," the team magazine of the China Young Pioneers, "China Young Pioneers," and various youth reading materials (the Youth Publishing House alone published 137 kinds of youth books and periodicals in one year, with a circulation of 6.6 million copies), all of which played a great educational role among young people.

    The Youth League has also established lectures in various cities, and recently has focused on establishing a system of propagandists in some places, with propagandists lecturing on current affairs, policies, basic knowledge of the League, and basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to League members and young people.

    In terms of political and ideological education of the Youth League, there is currently a lack of planning, and some places do not integrate this education with reality sufficiently. Some places also use practical examples for education but lack analysis. These situations are gradually being corrected.

    V.
    The youth movement of the past year, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and thanks to the active promotion of the Youth League and the efforts of the broad masses of young people, has made great progress and has made a good start for the Chinese youth movement in the new era.

    At present, our territory, Taiwan and Tibet, have not yet been liberated, and the United States is openly invading Taiwan and Korea and is plotting to expand its war of aggression. The recovery and development of large-scale production nationwide is underway. Therefore, the task of Chinese youth in the future is to accelerate production, master technology, and strive to learn various cultural, scientific, political, and military knowledge, so as to consolidate our national defense and strengthen the construction undertaking. In terms of political and ideological education, we need to continue to strengthen patriotic and internationalist education. As the backbone of promoting the youth movement, the Youth League must strengthen the education of the League, strengthen the leadership of the League, and further play the role of the League in various construction undertakings. Let us unite the youth of the whole country and strive forward under the banner of Mao Zedong.

　　一年来的青年运动
    冯文彬
    一
    从去年中华人民共和国成立的日子起，中国已经进入一个完全新的历史时代。过去的时代，我们是破坏一个旧社会。现在这个新时代，要建设一个新社会。我们面临着建设一个新社会的新任务。所以，中国新民主主义青年团在去年团的第一次全国代表大会上，指出团的基本任务，就是教育培养青年一代积极地参加新民主主义社会的建设。
    一年以来，完全证明这一方针是正确的。各地青年团员一般地都能在国家的各种建设事业中起了积极作用。青年团的组织有了很大的发展，现在已发展到三百万人以上。团的作用也随着团的发展而日益显著。目前青年团已逐渐成为人民政府和中国共产党的有力助手，已经成为中国青年运动的核心力量。中华全国民主青年联合总会和中华全国学生联合会在一年来的青年运动与学生运动中也起了不少的作用。
    二
    在生产建设事业中，青年团员和青年们的积极作用，往往表现在善于接受新鲜事物方面。中央人民政府和中国共产党在每一时期针对着生产建设发展的情况，提出新的号召和办法。青年人蓬勃有朝气，往往在响应号召实行新办法上表现得很积极。在展开工厂新纪录运动时，青年团员赵国有，首创新纪录。他在党和行政的鼓励下，不断改造自己的生产工具和技术，把车床头塔轮的标准时数，从估工十六小时减低到四小时。接着又创造了两点二十分、一点十六分、五十分钟车一个塔轮的新纪录。铁道部颁布改轮乘制为包乘制。在实行这个新制度时，青年工人起了很大的推动作用。在农村中，一些老农民恪守旧习惯，对于人民政府提倡科学的新的农作法，如人民政府所号召的植棉、浸种、秋植树、沤绿肥、打虫、挖井等，有时采观望态度。对于这些号召，青年团员和青年农民是最积极的提倡者与参加者。女团员和女青年改变了以前妇女不愿参加农业生产的风气，自己积极参加农业生产。特别在治黄、救灾等各种突击行动中，青年团员和青年们都做在前头。
    在工厂和农村青年中的缺点是：有少数青年对于从改进科学的生产方法，掌握生产技术中去发展生产还注意不够。还有一些青年团和青年积极分子往往自动地、只靠日以继夜地拚命工作中去增加产量，这就影响了健康，和不能持久的毛病。今后工厂、农村中，团员和青年们要根据青年的特点和能力和广大群众在一起，紧紧围绕着生产进行必要的而不是过多的活动，加强文化、技术、政治学习。从正确的劳动态度，用智慧和科学的方法与技术去发挥在生产中的作用。
    部队中建立青年团以后，在已建团的连队中，战士普遍表现积极。机关中的团员和青年也起了积极作用。
    三
    一年以来，在学校中的经常的新民主主义学习有了开展。在这一年中甫经解放的西南、华南诸省的学生，都积极地参加接管工作，普遍地进行初步的启蒙性的政治思想教育。这方面收到很大的成绩。这些新解放城市的学生，随着社会秩序的稳定，学校的正常开课，便和老解放区的学生一样地加强学校中的经常学习。一年来学校学生学习情绪普遍在提高，政治思想都有普遍的进步，特别是青年团员，一般地都能积极地学好功课，在课堂上细心听讲，课外有重点地作好预习和复习。并以自己的学习上的模范行为，推动了一般学生的学习。
    有些学校并以课外活动推动正课学习，如东北学生制造一些教学上有实际需要的教学工具，根据各人的爱好，在自愿的基础上，以各年级各门课程为单位，成立钻研小组，还有以学习为内容，通过游艺形式来增进知识。课外活动除以上所述外，尚有社会服务活动，如东北、北京等地学校医学院学生参加防止鼠疫及其他传染病的工作，农学院学生下乡参加消灭农作物病虫害的斗争。
    在一年中有些学校进行所谓“思想总结”、“民主评定”，对于思想改造，采用过急的办法。也有一些学校发生了功课过重、活动过多，因而发生了妨碍学生健康的现象。这件事最近已经为各方所注意。目前为了贯彻新民主主义学习方针，除了教育部门设法研究改革学制、课程、教学法外，正在减少活动，适当的调整课程，增加助学金和医药保健等，并提倡体育。
    在工厂、农村的青年中，正在开展文化学习，许多工厂举办工人文化业余补习学校，许多农村很久就举办了冬学、民校、识字班等。在这些学习组织里的学生，绝大多数是青年。青年团员是积极地支持这些学习组织，并在学习上起了模范作用。
    人民政府并在各地举办工农速成中学。单在上海一地就已开办一百一十二所，有学生三万五百九十四人。中央人民政府于今年一月并创设了一个新式的正规的中国人民大学，在这个学校里工农出身的学生占全校学生百分之六十三。全国各地学校都设有人民助学金，帮助解决贫寒学生上学的费用。
    四
    一年以来，在青年团与青年中，广泛地进行了爱国主义与国际主义的教育。这种教育是青年团的政治思想教育的重要的内容。
    这种教育首先是从实践中进行的。如去年庆祝中华人民共和国成立，今年纪念五一、五四大游行的行动，在华东的反对美制蒋机的轰炸运动，特别是在全国人民反对美帝国主义侵略台湾、朝鲜的运动，青年们都是积极地参加，并在其中受到了很大的爱国主义的教育。如庆祝中苏友好同盟条约的签订、庆祝斯大林大元帅七十寿辰的活动，在以米哈依洛夫同志为首的苏联青年代表团访问中国和这次世界民主青年联盟代表团访问中国的活动，在各种纪念国际青年的节日活动与出席世界青年与学生联欢节，出席德意志民主共和国、捷克、匈牙利等国青年大会的中国代表回国的讲演等活动，特别是和平签名运动，青年们都是积极地参加，并在其中受到了很大的国际主义教育。
    其次，青年团出版书刊，在青年中进行爱国主义和国际主义的教育。青年团中央机关刊物——《中国青年》双周刊，是全国销行最广的刊物之一，发行数达十三万份，是青年团进行政治思想教育的有力的工具。此外，有世界民主青年联盟刊物——《世界青年》的中文版，有中国少年儿童队队刊——《中国少年儿童》，并有各种青年读物（单是青年出版社出版的青年书刊，一年达一百三十七种，发行六百六十万册），都在青年中起了很大的教育作用。
    青年团并在各城市设立讲座，最近又在一些地方有重点地建立宣传员制度，由宣传员在团员和青年中讲授时事、政策、团的基本知识和马列主义、毛泽东思想的基本知识。
    在青年团政治思想教育方面，目前尚缺少计划性，一些地方进行这种教育时结合实际不够。也有的地方用实际例子进行教育但缺少分析。这些情形在逐渐改正中。
    五
    一年以来的青年运动，在中国共产党和人民政府领导下，由于青年团的积极推动，广大青年的努力，获得了很大的开展，为新时代中国青年运动作了一个良好的开端。
    目前我们的国土台湾、西藏尚未解放，美国公然侵略台湾、朝鲜，并在进行扩大侵略战争的阴谋，全国范围规模的生产的恢复与发展，正在进行。因此，今后中国青年的任务是，加紧生产，掌握技术，努力学习各种文化、科学、政治、军事知识，来巩固我国国防和加强建设事业。在政治思想教育方面，我们需要继续加强爱国主义与国际主义教育。作为推动青年运动的骨干——青年团，必须加强团的教育，加强团的领导，进一步地在各种建设中发挥团的作用。让我们全国青年团结起来，在毛泽东的旗帜下努力前进。
