　　People of Youzhadi Village, Xishan District, Yunnan
    Celebrate National Day, Write to Chairman Mao to Pay Respects and Thank Him for Leading the Ashi Pumi People to Liberation
    Request Supply of Cotton, Establishment of Middle School, and Improvement of Medical and Health Services

    [Report from this newspaper] The people of Youzhadi Village in Xishan District, Yunnan, celebrated National Day and wrote to Chairman Mao to thank him for leading the liberation of the Ashi Pumi people. The original letter is as follows: Chairman Mao:
    As this first joyous National Day arrives, we, the people of Youzhadi Village, offer our sincere enthusiasm to celebrate your leadership in liberating our Ashi Pumi people and all the Chinese people, and wish you good health!
    Our Youzhadi Village is a small village of sixty-seven households in Xishan District, Mile County, Yunnan. Xishan District is also the place where the Yunnan People's Guerrilla first raised the red flag. The men and women of our entire Youzhadi Village, together with the Ashi Pumi people and the Han people of the entire Xishan District, went through three years of heroic struggle and finally drove out the Kuomintang reactionary army. Because the majority of the residents of Xishan District are Ashi Pumi people, after liberation, under the correct implementation of the policy of national cooperation by the Communist Party and the People's Government, the Xishan District People's Government was established, and the district head, Long Jieren, is an advanced young man from our Ashi ethnic group. This is fundamentally different from the reactionary policies of oppressing ethnic minorities and dividing national unity in any past reactionary government era. Now, under your wise leadership, we have begun to realize national autonomy.
    We have been completely liberated politically (there are no landlords or rich peasants in our village). However, in terms of economic life, due to the past reactionary government's policy of oppressing ethnic minorities, we were driven into the deep mountains, where there was no good land to cultivate, and the grain we harvested was not enough to eat. In addition, the Kuomintang bandit army's nearly three years of cruel "sweeps," burning, killing, and looting, made us even poorer. Even in such poverty, after liberation, in order to reduce the financial difficulties of the country, this year our village voluntarily handed in 8,107.68 catties of public grain. Because under your leadership, we now have more favorable conditions to change our poverty, we are also determined to turn the poor mountains into fertile fields, just like the spirit of our ancestors who opened up mountains and established industries. However, we still need the government to help solve the following problems: First, supply cotton and teach women to learn to spin and weave. We are still using hemp cloth for clothing. Second, establish a middle school in Xishan District to train cadres so that children who cannot go out can have the opportunity to go to school. Third, improve rural medical and health work. The above are our most urgent hopes and the direction of our future efforts.
    With respectful greetings and wishing you eternal health!
    Youzhadi Village, Xishan District, Yunnan
    Village Chief: Jiang Bichang Deputy: Bi Dagui Farmers' Association Chairman: Wang Xuelin

　　云南西山区油乍地村人民
    庆祝国庆上书毛主席致敬感谢领导阿西濮族人翻身
    要求供应棉花创办中学改善医药卫生
    【本报讯】云南西山区油乍地村人民，庆祝国庆，上书毛主席，感谢毛主席领导阿西濮族人民的翻身。原信如下：毛主席：
    在这头一个可喜的国庆节到来的时候，我们油乍地全村的老百姓，谨以万分的热诚，来庆祝你领导我们阿西濮族的翻身，领导全中国人民的翻身，并祝贺你的身体康健！
    我们油乍地村，是云南弥勒县西山区一个六十七户人家的小庄子。而西山区又是云南人民游击队第一次插起红旗的地方。我们油乍地全村男女群众，曾和全西山阿西濮族人民与汉族合作，经历了三年的英勇斗争，终于驱逐了国民党反动军队。因为西山区大部分居住的是阿西濮族人，所以解放后，在共产党和人民政府正确执行民族合作的政策下，便成立了西山区人民政府，区长龙介仁就是我们阿西族一个先进的青年。这和过去任何反动政府时代压迫少数民族，分裂民族团结的反动政策，有着根本性质的不同，现在我们已经在你的英明领导下，开始实现民族自治了。
    我们在政治上已经完全翻身了（我们村里没地主富农）。但是，在经济生活上，由于过去反动政府压迫少数民族的政策，把我们赶在深山里，没有好地种，打的粮食不够吃，再加以国民党匪军近三年的残酷“扫荡”，烧杀抢掠，更害得我们穷苦不堪。就是这样穷苦，我们在解放后，为了减少国家财政的困难，今年我们村里曾自动的缴了八、一○七·六八斤公粮。因为在你的领导下，今后更有了改变穷困的有利条件，我们也有决心，像过去祖宗开山立业的精神，把穷山变成肥田。不过还需要政府帮助解决以下几个问题：第一、供给棉花，教妇女学纺织。我们现在还是以麻布为衣。第二、在西山区创办中学，培养干部，使不能外出的儿童有升学的机会。第三、改善农村医药卫生工作。以上是我们最迫切的希望，也是我们今后努力的方向。此致敬礼  并祝您身体永远健康！
    云南西山区油乍地村  村长  姜必昌  副  毕大贵  农会主席  王学林
