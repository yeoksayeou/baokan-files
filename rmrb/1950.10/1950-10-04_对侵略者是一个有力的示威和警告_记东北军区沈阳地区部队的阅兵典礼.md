　　A Powerful Demonstration and Warning to Aggressors
    ——A Record of the Military Parade of the Shenyang Area Troops of the Northeast Military Region
    Xu Fang
    October 1, 1950, in Shenyang, the azure sky seemed exceptionally high and vast. When the reporter stepped out of the door at six o'clock in the morning, the sides of several main streets, including Zhongshan Road, were already lined with crowds. Tens of thousands of red flags and colorful banners fluttered in the wind, and the deafening sound of gongs and drums rumbled in. The inspected People's Army and the vast people's contingents celebrating National Day were neatly arranged in good order on the large square in front of the Municipal Government.

    The people of Northeast China will remember it, especially on this day. They will remember the bloody disasters that the enemy puppets, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the Kuomintang army armed by American imperialism once brought to this fertile land. But those days of crawling on ice and sleeping in the snow, risking death and forgetting life, are finally over. In the past three or four years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, especially in the year since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the people of Northeast China, under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the Northeast People's Government, have made astonishing progress and new creations and constructions in all aspects, whether it is national defense, industry, agriculture, commerce, postal services, railways, culture, and education. People know that their lives have improved and been elevated, all because of the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Therefore, they have written to Chairman Mao one after another. Whether they are workers, peasants, soldiers, students, or staff, they are using unparalleled enthusiasm and practical actions to build and defend the motherland, and to stop the conspiracy of American imperialism to commit aggression, in order to thank the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government for their cultivation. Yes, they want to defend the motherland and world peace, because their happy life is inseparable from this. They were all embracing an excited mood, warmly welcoming their great National Day holiday.

    The sunlight shone on the red high-rise building of the Municipal Government, dazzlingly reflecting the flags of various people's democratic countries inserted at the top of the building, reflecting the national emblem, illuminating the huge portrait of the people's leader Chairman Mao, about three feet long, illuminating the six white-letter red banners hanging in front of the building, several bolts of cloth long, writing "Long Live the Chinese People's Leader Chairman Mao", "Long Live the World People's Leader Stalin", "Long Live the People's Republic of China", "People of the whole country unite to liberate Taiwan and Tibet!", "Oppose American imperialism's aggression against Korea and Taiwan," "The military and civilians of the whole country unite and strive to defend world peace!" Shining on the two large cartoons "Powerful Peace Force" and "Build Our New Great Wall" hanging to the left and right of Chairman Mao's portrait, shining on the three platforms in front of the main entrance of the Municipal Government. The middle platform is the reviewing stand, where the leaders of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Northeast Military Region, the Northeast People's Government, and the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government are standing. On the left is the guest stand, with guests including Soviet Consul General to Shenyang, Ledav, Chief Representative of the Korean People's Democratic Republic's Commercial Representative Office in Northeast China, Choi Il, and Soviet Commercial Representative in Northeast China, Boyek, and Deputy Director of the Shenyang Railway Administration of the Sino-Soviet Railway, Durasov. The platform on the right is the command platform.

    At 8:00 AM, the inspection began. After the inspection, Commander Gao returned to the reviewing stand. The military parade began. The team, led by Deputy Commander He, marched vigorously, holding high the military flag, and marching solemnly towards the reviewing stand in rows to the sound of majestic military music.

    The navy and air force ground forces of the People's Army are still young in China, but they are growing vigorously. They and the powerful army jointly and forcefully defend the Northeast national defense of the motherland.

    Following closely in formation and passing the reviewing stand were infantry, cavalry, motorized troops, and artillery. It is this people's army that, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao for more than 20 years, has gone through the Land Revolutionary War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation; defeated the Japanese aggressors and the Kuomintang reactionary army armed by American imperialism. It has been tempered into a powerful and invincible force for consolidating national defense and defending world peace. They declare to all enemies that if the imperialist aggressors dare to invade our land, they will resolutely and thoroughly eliminate them. At the same time, they are soberly confident: We have more strength with every step forward. In the past year, they have been conducting combat and suppressing bandits, and participating in production and construction. Their achievements are remarkable; they are a fighting force and a production force. They are determined to liberate all the land of the motherland from the hands of imperialism, oppose aggression, and strengthen national armed construction to fight to the end to defend the freedom and independence of the motherland. When the howitzer and anti-aircraft gun infantry began to march, rows of planes, three at a time, passed overhead from north to south; immediately, the sky and the ground merged into a sea of sound. Then came the mule and horse artillery, carrying various cannons. All these weapons are American-made. Truman and his accomplices will know that these were all transported to the Chinese people from the sea and from the air through Chiang Kai-shek, the public enemy of the Chinese people. This symbolizes the shameful failure of American imperialism, although it is still committing atrocities on the land of our neighboring country, Korea. But in the face of the Chinese people's and the world people's determination to defend peace, it is certain that they will eventually reap the bitter fruit.

    At 9:40, the military parade ended. Waves of slogans erupted like a mountain torrent. The military music started again, and the mass demonstration parade began. Countless red flags, countless portraits of Chinese people's leaders and communist leaders from all over the world, surged in with the boundless stream of people. Led by the Shenyang Municipal Health Bureau's ambulance team, followed by workers from factories such as the May 1st Ordnance Factory, and students from various schools. They shouted "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live the Communist Party!" "Long Live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!" "Long Live Stalin!" "Oppose American Imperialism's Aggression Against Korea and Taiwan!" Some raised their fists, some waved colorful small flags, and when they passed the reviewing stand, they exchanged salutes, and the reviewing stand and below were intertwined with enthusiastic cheers and thunderous applause.

    At this time, the vanguard of the People's Armed Forces had passed Sanjing Road, turned onto Zhongshan Road, headed straight for the city along Zhonghua Road. The masses who did not enter the square organized themselves and filled the streets and alleys, cheering and shouting "Liberate Taiwan, Liberate Tibet!" This is their demand and wish. They also dedicated flowers and scattered colored paper to their own soldiers, fully expressing their love for their own troops. Among the masses, the most prominent were the workers' ranks. Several large horizontal banners held by workers from the Huangguantun Railway Factory in Shenyang City stated that they had completed amazing production tasks in September to welcome the National Day holiday. A propaganda painting by the Shenyang Station workers read: "The Shenyang Station workers are preparing to repair seven gatehouses with unparalleled enthusiasm to welcome the winter transport!" All this shows what a potentially rich nation the Chinese nation is. Today, they are using all their practical actions to shed blood and sweat for the construction of their motherland, "Oppose aggression and support peace!" This slogan has been erected like a monument in the heart of everyone, and it is unshakable. Our country and our people will always be loyal friends of all oppressed and exploited nations, and will always support the struggle to overthrow imperialist reactionary oppression.

    In Shenyang, the entire city is a grand meeting for celebrating National Day. Let us raise our arms and shout for this great and joyous day, for the heroic New China! The people's motherland is calling on us, the people's leaders are calling on us, our motherland is unshakable, let us, under the great call, devote all our strength to defending and building our motherland! Let imperialism plot war conspiracies against the world in their bandit nests! The Chinese people cannot be deceived. In front of the Chinese people, there has never been an undefeated enemy, and no imperialist shackles that cannot be shattered!

　　对侵略者是一个有力的示威和警告
    ——记东北军区沈阳地区部队的阅兵典礼
    徐放
    一九五○年十月一日，在沈阳，蔚蓝的天空显得分外的高旷。当记者于早晨六点钟走出门去时，沿着中山路等几道大街两边已排满了人群，千万面红旗、彩旗，迎风招展，充耳的锣鼓声动地滚来。受检阅的人民军队和庆祝国庆的广大人民队伍，在市府门前的大广场上，有秩序地排列得整整齐齐。
    东北人民是都会记得的，特别是在这一天。他们会记得敌伪、国民党反动派及美帝国主义所武装的国民党军队，曾经为这块沃土带来过怎样血腥的灾难。但那些爬冰卧雪、冒死忘生的日子终于过去了，三四年来，在共产党、毛主席的领导下，尤其是在中华人民共和国成立后这一年以来，东北人民，在中央人民政府和东北人民政府的领导下，无论是国防、工业、农业、商业、邮电、铁路、文教等各方面，都已经有了惊人的发展，有了新的创造与建设。人们知道，自己的生活改善了，提高了，这都是因为有共产党和毛主席的正确领导；因而，他们纷纷上书给毛主席，不管是工人、农民、士兵、学生、职员，他们为了感谢共产党、毛主席和人民政府的培养，都正用着无比的热情，以实际行动，在建设祖国，保卫祖国，制止美帝国主义的阴谋侵略。是的，他们要保卫祖国、保卫世界和平，因为他们的幸福生活，是和这分不开的。他们都怀抱着兴奋的心情，热烈地迎接着自己的伟大的国庆节日。
    阳光辉照在市府的红色高楼上，光芒夺目地映着插在楼头的各人民民主国家的旗帜，映着国徽，照着长约三丈的人民领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，映着垂挂在楼前的那六条几匹布长的白字红幡，写着“中国人民领袖毛主席万岁”、“世界人民领袖斯大林万岁”、“中华人民共和国万岁”、“全国人民团结起来，解放台湾，解放西藏！”“反对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜，反对美帝国主义侵略台湾”、“全国军民团结起来为保卫世界和平而奋斗！”映着挂在毛主席像下左右“强大的和平力量”、“筑成我们新的长城”那两大幅漫画，映着市府正门前的三个台。那中间的台是阅兵台，台上站着中共中央东北局、东北军区、东北人民政府及沈阳市委、市府首长。左边是来宾台，来宾中有苏联驻沈阳领事馆总领事列达夫，朝鲜人民民主主义共和国驻东北商业代表团首席代表崔一，及苏联驻东北商业代表波也克和中长路沈阳铁路管理局副局长杜拉索夫。右边的台是指挥台。
    八时，开始检阅。检阅完毕，高司令员返回阅兵台。军式分列开始。队伍由贺副司令员率领着，英气勃勃，高举着军旗，在雄壮的军乐声里，一列一列的向阅兵台庄严的走来。
    人民军队的海军陆上部队、空军陆上部队，在中国还是年青的，但他们正在有力的成长，他们和强大的陆军，共同有力地保卫着祖国的东北国防。
    跟踵列队通过阅兵台的是步兵、骑兵，以及摩托化部队、炮兵。就是这支人民的队伍，二十几年来，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，度过了土地革命战争，抗日战争，解放战争；打败了日本侵略者，打败了美帝国主义所武装的国民党反动军队，已经百炼成钢，成为一支强大的，无敌的巩固国防、保卫着世界和平的力量。他们向一切敌人们宣称，只要帝国主义侵略者敢来侵略我们的国土，他们便要坚决地把它彻底消灭。同时他们也清醒的自信：我们进一步也有进一步的力量。这一年来，他们在进行作战剿匪，并参加生产建设，他们的功绩是卓著的；他们是战斗队，也是生产队，他们誓必要从帝国主义手里解放全部祖国的土地，反对侵略，加强国家武装建设为保卫祖国的自由、独立而奋斗到底。当榴弹炮、高射炮步队开始行进时，三架一排一排的飞机，自北往南，凌空而过；立时，天上地下交溶成一片声海。接着过来的是骡马炮兵，驮着各种炮。所有的这些武器，都是美式的。杜鲁门及其帮凶们当会知道，这都是他们给中国人民从海上、从空中，通过中国人民的公敌蒋介石之手，运输给中国人民的。这，便象征着美帝国主义的可耻的失败，尽管它仍在我们邻邦朝鲜的土地上大施暴行，但在中国人民，及世界人民保卫和平的决心面前，他们归终要自食恶果是肯定的。
    九时四十分，军式分列结束了。一片一片口号之声如山洪迸发。军乐再起，群众的示威游行开始了。只见千万面红旗，千万幅中国人民领袖及世界各国共产党领袖的画像，随着无涯际的人流漫天盖地而来。以沈阳市卫生局的救护队为前导，接着是五一兵工厂等厂的工人，及各校学生。他们向检阅台高呼“毛主席万岁！”“共产党万岁！”“中国人民解放军万岁！”“斯大林万岁！”“反对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜、侵略台湾！”有的举着拳头，有的摇着各色小旗，当通过检阅台时，并互致敬礼，台上台下交织着热烈的欢呼和雷动的掌声。
    这时先头的人民武装部队已通过三经路，向中山路绕向中华路直奔城内而去了，没有进入广场的群众，有组织的塞满了大街小巷，夹道欢呼，高喊着“解放台湾，解放西藏！”这是他们的要求和愿望。他们并为自己的子弟兵献花，撒彩纸，充分的表现了他们对于自己队伍的爱戴。在群众队伍中，最突出的是工人行列。沈阳市皇姑屯铁路工厂工人举着的几幅大横联上，标写着在九月份中，为迎接国庆节日，他们已完成了惊人的生产任务。沈阳站工友的宣传画上写着：“沈阳站工友以无比的热情，准备修复七处闸楼迎接冬运！”这一切，说明了中华民族是怎么一个潜力丰富的民族。他们在今天正用一切实际行动，在为自己祖国的建设流血流汗，“反对侵略，拥护和平！”这口号已像碑一样的在每一个人的心头竖起，这是不可动撼的。我们的国家，我们的人民将永远是一切被压迫、被剥削的民族的忠实朋友，将永远支持为打垮帝国主义反动压迫而斗争。
    在沈阳，全市就是个庆祝国庆节的大会场。让我们为这千年的大喜日，英雄的新中国而举臂高呼罢！人民的祖国在号召我们，人民的领袖在号召我们，我们的祖国是不可动撼的，让我们在伟大的号召之下，为保卫和建设我们的祖国而付出全部力量！让帝国主义在他们的土匪窝里计划着来向这世界进行着战争阴谋罢！中国人民是不可欺侮的，在中国人民面前从来没有存在过任何打不倒的敌人，和什么粉碎不了的帝国主义的枷锁！
    （十月一日夜在沈阳。）
