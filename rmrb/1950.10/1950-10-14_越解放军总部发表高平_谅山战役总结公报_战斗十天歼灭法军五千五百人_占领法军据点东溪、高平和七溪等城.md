Xinhua News Agency, 13th. According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 12th: The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army issued a communique on the morning of the 12th, detailing the great victory of the Vietnam People's Army on the northern border front and the detailed results of the battle. In this campaign, the People's Army annihilated the troops led by two colonels, Lépine and Charton, and liberated Đông Khê, Cao Bằng and Thất Khê, which had been occupied by the French army.

The communique stated: Since the Vietnam People's Army launched a devastating attack on the French stronghold of Đông Khê, 45 kilometers southeast of Cao Bằng, the French defense line between Lạng Sơn and Cao Bằng was severely threatened and completely disintegrated. The French army was forced to begin withdrawing from the provincial capital of Cao Bằng. In carrying out this withdrawal plan, they sent a well-trained army of 3,000 men, led by Colonel Lépine from Lạng Sơn-Thất Khê, to Cao Bằng, northwest of Lạng Sơn, and airlifted reinforcements to the Cao Bằng garrison. The Cao Bằng garrison was planning to withdraw to Lạng Sơn under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Charton. Lépine's force consisted of 3,000 men, composed of the most elite French troops in North Vietnam, including four battalions, one of which was a foreign legion paratrooper battalion. Charton's force consisted of 2,000 men, including three battalions. The enemy's plan was to have these two forces meet at Đông Khê and then withdraw along the Cao Bằng-Lạng Sơn highway to Lạng Sơn.

Lépine's force left Thất Khê on the night of September 30 and was besieged by the Vietnam People's Army near Đông Khê on October 1. After seven days of continuous fighting, it was completely annihilated southwest of Đông Khê on October 7. Charton's troops, who withdrew from Cao Bằng on October 3, were intercepted by the People's Army 20 kilometers south of Nam Pang. The enemy abandoned all their vehicles, horses, donkeys, and heavy weapons on the highway and fled through the mountain roads between Ban Lung (transliteration) and Mong La (transliteration). By October 7, when the vanguard of Charton's force reached only one kilometer away from Lépine's force, the remnants of Lépine's force had been completely annihilated. The Vietnam People's Army then surrounded Charton's force. After two days of fighting, Charton's force was also completely annihilated between Lan Hai (transliteration) and Na Khe Ou (transliteration) on October 9.

On October 7, another 800 French troops reinforced the remnants of Lépine and Charton's forces. This force was also surrounded by the People's Army, and part of it was annihilated. While the Vietnam People's Army was fighting Lépine and Charton's forces, other People's Army units destroyed four French strongholds between Thất Khê and Na San (transliteration) southeast of Thất Khê, and Ban Nai (transliteration) northeast of Thất Khê. All the enemy forces in Ban Nai (including 60 French and Germans) immediately surrendered to the People's Army after the first shot was fired. From the night of October 9 to the morning of the 11th, the Vietnam People's Army continued to pursue the fleeing French troops.

In ten days of fighting, the Vietnam People's Army annihilated approximately 5,500 French troops from two units and recovered five outpost strongholds. Approximately 2,500 enemy troops were captured, including Colonel Lépine, Lieutenant Colonel Charton, Colonel Douris, head of the French Medical Corps, as well as one Major, three Captains, and more than twenty Lieutenants. Hải Độ Sở (transliteration), the puppet provincial governor of Cao Bằng Province, and a large number of traitors were also captured at the same time. Currently, a large number of remnants are still hiding in the mountains. It is expected that the number of enemy prisoners will increase.

The number of French deaths has not yet been finalized. It is estimated that 2,300 French regular troops and auxiliary troops were killed.

The Vietnam People's Army seized all the weapons and equipment of Lépine and Charton's forces, including six 105mm howitzers, two British-made 94mm howitzers, 50 vehicles, as well as warehouses containing various equipment and storage depots for grain, ammunition, gasoline, and medical supplies. When the enemy hurriedly withdrew from Cao Bằng and Thất Khê, all these materials were left untouched.

This campaign in the Cao Bằng-Đông Khê-Thất Khê area was waged against a powerful and large enemy force, and the fighting lasted for nine days and nights. The Vietnam People's Army achieved a complete victory in this campaign.

　　越解放军总部发表高平——谅山战役总结公报
    战斗十天歼灭法军五千五百人
    占领法军据点东溪、高平和七溪等城
    【新华社十三日讯】据越南通讯社十二日讯：越南人民解放军总部十二日晨发表公报，详述越南人民解放军在北部边境战线获得巨大胜利的经过及详细战果。人民解放军在这一战役中歼灭了赖巴西和夏尔同两个校官所统率的军队，并解放了法军占领的东溪、高平和七溪。
    公报称：自越南人民解放军在高平东南四十五公里的东溪予法军据点以歼灭性的攻击后，谅山与高平之间的法军防线即受到人民解放军的严重威胁，完全瓦解。法军被迫开始自高平省会撤退。在执行这一撤退计划时，他们从谅山——七溪派了一支由赖巴西上校统率的训练优良的军队到谅山西北的高平去，并对高平的守军空运援军。高平的守军正打算在夏尔同中校指挥下向谅山撤退。赖巴西的队伍计有三千人，由法国在北越最精锐的部队组成，包括四个营，其中有外国兵团伞兵的一个营。夏尔同所部计有两千人，包括三个营。敌人的计划是要使这两支队伍在东溪会合，然后再沿高平——谅山公路向谅山撤退。
    赖巴西的队伍于九月三十日夜离开七溪，于十月一日在东溪附近遭到越南人民解放军的围攻，经过连续七天的战斗后，至十月七日在东溪西南地方全部被歼。十月三日撤出高平的夏尔同部队，在南平以南二十公里的那岑被人民解放军部队截击。敌军将他们所有的车辆、马匹、驴子、与重武器都丢在公路上，取道班隆（译音）与蒙拉（译音）间的山路窜逃。到十月七日，当夏尔同部队的前锋部队抵达距离赖巴西的队伍仅一公里的时候，赖巴西的残余部队已全被歼灭。越南人民解放军部队又将夏尔同的部队包围。经过两天的战斗后，夏尔同的部队也于十月九日在兰海（译音）和那克欧（译音）之间完全被歼。
    十月七日，又有八百名法军增援赖巴西和夏尔同的残部，这支队伍也被人民解放军部队包围，一部分被歼。当越南人民解放军正与赖巴西与夏尔同的部队作战时，其他的人民解放军部队在七溪与七溪东南的纳山（译音）以及七溪东北的班奈（译音）之间，消灭了法军据点四处。班奈的所有敌军（包括六十名法国人与德国人）在第一枪响后，立即向人民解放军投降。自十月九日夜至十一日晨，越南人民解放军部队继续追击溃逃的法军。
    在十天战斗中，越南人民解放军歼灭了两支法军约五千五百人，收复前哨据点五处。俘虏敌军约二千五百人，内有赖巴西上校、夏尔同中校、法军医处处长杜利斯上校，以及少校一名、上尉三名、中尉二十余名。高平省伪省长海度楚（译音）以及大批卖国贼亦同时被俘。目前还有大批残敌仍藏在山中。预料敌军俘虏数目还要增加。
    法军死亡数目尚无最后统计。据估计，法军正规部队和辅助部队被击毙二千三百名。
    越南人民解放军缴获了赖巴西和夏尔同部队的全部武器与装备，计有一○五公厘大炮六门，英制九四口径大炮两门，汽车五十辆，以及存有各种装备的仓库和储存粮食、军火、汽油、医药供应品的储藏库。敌军自高平与七溪匆匆撤退时，所有这些物资都原封未动地留在那里。
    这次在高平——东溪——七溪地区的战役，是对强有力的大量敌军进行的，战斗连续九天九夜。越南人民解放军在这次战役中获得了完全的胜利。
