Xinhua News Agency, October 10th: According to a Polish Press Agency report from Warsaw on the 7th, the Polish and French delegations attending the preparatory meeting of the Second World Peace Congress in Prague recently held a joint meeting. Among those attending the meeting were Zygmunt Dymbrowski, Chairman of the Polish National Committee for the Defense of Peace, and Farge, Chairman of the French Fighters for Peace and Freedom Association.

The meeting issued a joint statement expressing satisfaction with the German Democratic Republic's condemnation of all crimes that could disrupt peace and its firm guarantee to fight against them. The statement said: In view of the remilitarization of West Germany and the active support of former Nazis by the U.S. and British imperialists, it has been decided to unite the forces of the peace movements of both countries, heighten vigilance, and take joint action when necessary. Because of the close friendship between Poland and France and their common experience of being invaded twice by German imperialism, this agreement on joint action will surely help to strengthen the fraternal cooperation between the two countries.
