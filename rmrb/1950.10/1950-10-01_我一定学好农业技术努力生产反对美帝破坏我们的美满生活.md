　　I Will Definitely Learn Agricultural Technology and Work Hard to Produce
    Oppose American Imperialism's Sabotage of Our Happy Life
    Liang Jun, National First Place Female Tractor Team Leader, Agricultural Labor Model of the Northeast
    The great People's Republic of China has been established for a whole year. In this year, our People's Liberation Army has basically defeated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang supported by American imperialism, liberated the mainland of our country, and the people have begun to live a happy and fulfilling life, all working hard to build their own country.
    In the north of our motherland, we are driving modern tractors, reclaiming the frontier of the motherland, turning barren land into fertile fields, and creating a happy and fulfilling future.
    However, what we like is precisely what the Wall Street bosses of imperialism oppose. They attempt to treat peaceful people as their beasts of burden, as their slaves. Recently, American imperialist planes have again bombed our territory and harmed our compatriots. We are extremely opposed to this shameless behavior. We cannot let history regress. We resolutely support the protest made by Foreign Minister Zhou on behalf of the Chinese people. In the future, I will definitely study technology well, manage the tractor team well, and work hard to produce. Reclaim more wasteland, produce more, harvest more grain, support the war of liberation, and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandits as soon as possible.
    American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, we warn you: Today, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have stood up and will no longer be slaves of imperialism and its puppets, Chiang Kai-shek. In order to protect the country, to protect the beautiful life we have achieved through struggle, and for peace and happiness, on the occasion of the first anniversary of the National Day, we protest against the brutal and shameless oppression of American imperialism.

　　我一定学好农业技术努力生产  反对美帝破坏我们的美满生活
    东北农业劳动模范全国第一名女拖拉机队长  梁军
    伟大的中华人民共和国成立已经一周年了。在这一年之中，我们的人民解放军基本上打垮了以美帝国主义支持的蒋介石匪帮，解放了我国大陆土地，人民开始过着幸福美满的生活，都在努力建设自己的国家。
    我们在祖国的北方，驾驶着近代化的拖拉机，开垦着祖国边疆，把荒原变成沃野，创造幸福与美满的未来。
    然而我们所喜欢的正是帝国主义华尔街的老板们所反对的，他们企图把和平的人们，作为他们的牛马，作为他们的奴隶。最近，美帝国主义的飞机又来轰炸我国领土，残害我国同胞。这种无耻的行为，我们是极端反对的。我们不能让历史倒退。我们坚决拥护周外长代表中国人民所提出的抗议，今后我一定好好学习技术，搞好拖拉机队，努力生产。多开荒，多生产，多打粮食，支援解放战争，早日消灭蒋介石残匪。
    美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮，我们正告你：今天我们中国人民在共产党和毛主席的领导下站起来了，再不做帝国主义和他的傀儡，蒋介石的奴隶了。为了保护国家，为了保护由我们奋斗得来的美好生活，为了和平幸福，在国庆一周年之际，我们向美帝国主义残暴无耻欺压我们的行为提出抗议。
