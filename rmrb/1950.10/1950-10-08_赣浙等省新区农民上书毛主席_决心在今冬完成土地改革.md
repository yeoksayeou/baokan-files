Farmers in New Liberated Areas of Jiangxi, Zhejiang and other Provinces Write to Chairman Mao
Determined to Complete Land Reform This Winter
Letter from Gong Yaoshui, a Farmer from Xiaolan Village, Nanchang
(Reported by this newspaper) Many farmers in the newly liberated areas of Jiangxi, northern Anhui, Zhejiang and other places wrote to Chairman Mao, reflecting the pain of being oppressed and exploited by feudal forces and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in the past, and the joy of gaining freedom and surviving the famine under the leadership of Chairman Mao after liberation. All are determined to do their best to complete land reform this winter, and to always follow the savior Chairman Mao and strive to create a beautiful and happy future. The letters overflow with the farmers' sincere and ardent feelings. Excerpts are published below:

Gong Yaoshui, a farmer from Xiaolan Village, Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, wrote in his letter: "I am a poor peasant from Xiaolan Village, Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province. Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, I rented 4.5 mu of land. In a good year, I could harvest 16 shi of grain, pay the landlord 9 shi of rent, 5 dou of seed grain, and 1 shi of grain for plowing. After working hard for a year, after paying the rent, seeds and plowing costs, I would only get 5 shi and 5 dou of grain, which was not enough for my family of five to eat for three months. I wanted to do a small business selling vegetables, but the Kuomintang army wanted to buy them at low prices, giving me very little money. So there was no way out. I had to sell my labor, but even working all day, my family still couldn't eat two meals a day. The Kuomintang reactionary government ordered the conscription of soldiers. Those bandit gang's lackeys, the Bao chiefs and Jia chiefs, received the order and became like wolves and tigers, taking the police to people's homes. I was 22 years old, meeting the age for conscription. They came to my house and without saying a word, just demanded money. Each conscript had to pay 16 silver dollars. If you didn't give the money, they would arrest you. Hearing this, I was terrified and had no choice but to promise to borrow the money. My mother and I pleaded with the landlords to lend us money. One landlord said he didn't have any, another was afraid I wouldn't be able to repay. We went to five families, and finally went to a landlord who specialized in lending money at high interest rates. He said he had money, but wouldn't lend money, he would lend grain from the autumn harvest. At that time, grain cost five yuan per shi, and he lent it for two yuan and fifty cents, to be repaid with one shi of grain at harvest time. At that time, life was the most important thing, so I had to borrow it no matter how high the interest was. There was no other way. That year, the conscription fee and head tax were collected several times, and I borrowed more than 20 shi of grain in total, but my family still couldn't eat two meals a day. Under such circumstances, farmers lived one day at a time. After a few months, I heard that the Communist Party had crossed the Yangtze River. The army was large, the plan was good, and the fighting was like breaking bamboo. In less than a month, Nanchang was liberated. After the liberation, working comrades came to my village, promoted the policies of the Communist Party and the People's Army, and organized farmers' associations. I joined the farmers' association at that time. After the establishment of the farmers' association, rent and interest reduction were implemented, and feudal bullies and landlords were opposed. In these struggles, I vented all my grievances and suffering. The feudal bullies and landlords were forced to lower their heads and honestly admit their mistakes. Now the poor people are standing up. After that, it was the autumn grain collection. I first paid my own public grain in full, and then helped the farmers' association to resolutely complete the task of public grain, and I was very happy to do so. The village began to build a Communist Youth League, and I applied to join the League. With the approval of the higher-level League committee, I became an official League member, and I felt even happier. Attending League classes and participating in League life further enhanced my political awareness. I resolutely support the Communist Party, respond to the government's various calls, and am willing to take the lead in doing things. During this year's spring plowing, I cultivated carefully, accumulated more fertilizer, and selected good seeds. By the summer and autumn, the 6.5 mu of land I planted yielded 2.5 shi more grain than last year. I also planted watermelons, sesame, and sweet potatoes on 2 mu of wasteland, which also grew very well. My family also has a weaving machine for weaving cloth, so with men plowing and women weaving, life is getting better day by day. I think if it weren't for the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the instructions of the People's Government, the poor would never be able to stand up. Now my village is implementing land reform, and the land is going to be returned to my family. The feudal landlords and bullies in the countryside have been overthrown. From now on, we will be the masters of our own house, and everyone is satisfied in their hearts.

Great Chairman Mao, you are truly the great savior of the people. We will always follow you and the Chinese Communist Party, and we will always live happy, free, and joyful lives."

Letter from the Farmers' Representative Conference of Changxiu Township, Jiashan

The entire delegation of the Fourth Farmers' Representative Conference of Changxiu Township, Jiashan County, Zhejiang, wrote in a letter to Chairman Mao: "Under your wise leadership, the farmers of our Changxiu Township overthrew the bullies and landlords who used to ride on our heads. Everyone dug up the roots of poverty, poured out their bitterness, and reduced rent. Last year, in order to support the Liberation War and to enable the People's Liberation Army to liberate more suffering compatriots, we enthusiastically and quickly completed the task of paying public grain. This year, everyone carried out social mutual assistance and free lending during the spring and summer famines. Everyone also jointly organized drought resistance work, weeding twice as much as usual and applying more fertilizer. Originally, we had a very serious insect pest problem here. However, under your leadership, this year, after three seasons of insect control campaigns in the spring, summer, and autumn, everyone, men, women, old and young, took action, and we basically eliminated the insect pests and picked all the rice borer eggs. In addition, you lent everyone soybean cake this year, so the early and mid-season rice harvests in Changxiu Township generally increased by about 20%. We firmly believe that under your leadership, the situation will get better day by day. On September 6th, we held the first Farmers' Representative Conference in the township government during the land reform to discuss our own land reform matters. In the subsequent land reform work, we will definitely listen to you and do things according to your words. Please rest assured. We have suffered enough from the persecution of the Japanese devils in the past. Today, the planes of the American imperialists have again invaded the airspace of Andong and slaughtered our compatriots. In order to defend our country, which is becoming more and more prosperous, and to protect our elderly parents and young siblings, all 369 delegates enthusiastically participated in the peace signature campaign at the conference. After returning to the village, we will mobilize all 4,637 people in the township to participate in the signature campaign to defend world peace."

Letter from the Farmers' Representative Conference of Gaozhao Township, Jiaxing

The entire delegation of the Third Session of the Fourth Farmers' Representative Conference of Gaozhao Township, Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province, a land reform experimental area, wrote in a letter: "We are holding a meeting here to bid farewell to Delegate Lü Jiashui who is attending the National Labor Model Conference. He is a farmer in our township who is good at production, good at labor, and active in work. Thinking back to the past when the reactionary government ruled, farmers were worse off than cattle and horses. Not to mention seeing the county magistrate, it was rare to even see a district chief. With the wise leadership of the Communist Party and you, we can also participate in the National Labor Conference, which makes us feel very honored. Our Gaozhao Township is the first in the province to experiment with land reform. After the rectification of rural cadres, we began to promote the Land Reform Law from August 1st. After this in-depth mobilization, we all understood that we laboring farmers are now in charge, and we recognize that labor is glorious. On the 14th, we began to classify classes, first evaluating hired, poor, and middle peasants, then wealthy peasants, and finally landlords. We united the hired, poor, and middle peasants, neutralized the wealthy peasants, and concentrated our efforts to use struggle and reasoning to overthrow the bully landlords, making them lower their heads in front of us. Starting on the 31st, we began to distribute land, and everyone was able to be selfless, unite and yield to each other, and negotiate democratically. Hired and poor peasants received 2.9 mu per person, original farming peasants received 3.8 mu per person, and single men received double that, 5.8 mu. The township confiscated 4,424.27 mu of land, and 1,462 people participated in the distribution. This allowed those who had no land in the past to get land, and those who rented land to turn it into their own land. Under the multifaceted care of the government, the original farming peasants were very satisfied. The wealthy peasants no longer relied on the landlords. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and you, and the bloodshed and sweat of the People's Liberation Army, we farmers who have suffered for thousands of years have completely turned over. While we were carrying out land reform, we were also producing. All 1,926.1 mu of early rice in the township have been harvested, with an increase of 25% compared to last year. The 6,934.26 mu of late rice have generally been weeded three or four times, plus active pest control and fertilization, we must strive to increase production by 30%. After we have been distributed land, we guarantee to be thrifty, plant more spring flowers, gather more river mud, collect more aquatic plants, and accumulate more fertilizer. We must catch up to the 1937 level (harvesting three shi of rice per mu), and strive to have a surplus of one year's grain within five years. Thinking back to the suffering of the past, we know the sweetness of today. Our lives will get better step by step, and we will not forget our roots after turning over. We must use practical actions to thank the Communist Party and you, and resolutely support the People's Liberation Army in quickly liberating Taiwan and Tibet." Letters from Zhang Shunqing, village director, Meng Asi, deputy director, Pang Alai, director of the Farmers' Association, Li Youkun, deputy director of Wu Village, Zhaohe Township, Hang County; all members of the New Democratic Youth League in Zhaohe Township and Baziqiao Township; Gong Kaifa, Xu Liben, Hu Heyi, and Hu Lianyuan, farmers of Cangli Village, Yingzhou Township, Chengguan District, Tangxi County; Dai Zirong, head of Chengguan Township, Chen Shuangtian, deputy head, the Farmers' Associations of the first and second villages, Chen Zhanglin, head of the first village, Zheng Fengxian, head of the second village, and all members of Chengguan Township, Tangxi County, also wrote similar words, expressing gratitude to Chairman Mao. The Zhaohe Township Farmers' Association also has another letter, which reads: "Chairman Mao: You led us to organize the Farmers' Association, fight landlords and bullies, and led us poor people to turn over. Now we poor farmers have received all the glory. In the past, under the oppression of the Chiang bandits, we had to pay conscription fees several times a year, and we were also subjected to the exploitation of landlords and bullies and the oppression of pseudo-Bao chiefs and Jia chiefs. Now our farmers have seen the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army, who are like the blue sky, helping us poor people do things, leading us to produce, so that everyone has food to eat, everyone has clothes to wear, and everyone has land to cultivate. Thanks to you, we have today."

The letter from the Farmers' Associations of Zhaohe Township and Baziqiao Township, Sandun District, Hang County, Zhejiang Province, stated: "We have suffered thousands of years of oppression and exploitation, and we were so oppressed that we could hardly breathe. Every day, we got up at five o'clock and went to bed at midnight, but we were always hungry and cold. After liberation, the farmers turned over, and we knew that we were the masters. Under your wise leadership, everyone has stepped up their labor, cultivated in a timely manner, and built water conservancy projects, carried out pest control campaigns, and accumulated fertilizer. According to this year's early rice harvest, it will increase by 20% to 30% compared to last year. It is estimated that the late rice harvest will also be better than in previous years. We deeply believe in your words, 'Production brings prosperity, labor is glorious.' Land reform is about to begin. We guarantee to complete this unprecedented great task in history. Please rest assured!"

Letter from Tangxi Chengguan District Farmers' Association

The letter from the Wang Village Farmers' Association in Chengguan Township, Chengguan District, Tangxi County, Zhejiang Province, reads: "We suffered deeply from the rule and oppression of the Kuomintang bandits in the past. We thought we would never see the light of day again. Who would have thought that you would liberate us from hell last year and let us see the light of day. This is so happy! You and the People's Government led us to reduce rent and interest, and we gained a lot of benefits. You also led us to organize and fight against bullies, so we could pour out our bitterness, and we turned over step by step. Now you are leading us to produce, build river embankments, prevent floods, attract moths to collect eggs, and call on us to increase income by 10%. You are thinking about us and wanting us to have a good life in every way. You are even better than our parents. Now our early rice has all been harvested, and it is estimated to increase by more than 20%. We haven't had such a good harvest in many years! You are so good to us. We will always listen to you and follow you, so that we can have a good life. Everyone must do everything according to you and do a good job in production to repay you. The most important thing here now is late rice. In order to respond to your call, the women and young people in our village are actively catching insects and paying attention to catching insects when working in the fields. We are now sowing buckwheat, vegetables and other late-maturing crops. And we are trying our best to save money. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, everyone did not give gifts or burn incense. The whole village saved 4,500 jin of rice. We used this money to buy fertilizer and agricultural tools, and we are determined to further improve production. After the promulgation of the agricultural tax regulations, all our members discussed them and felt that this method was very good. We all guarantee to pay the public grain within two days when collecting grain, and we must hand in clean and dry grain. Because we know that agricultural tax is the capital for us to turn over. You are working hard day and night for our turnaround and a good life, and we are very grateful. But we ask you to take good care of your health. Health is the most important thing, because we need you to lead us forever."

The letter from all villagers of the Seventh Village, Yingzhou Township, Chengguan District, Tangxi County, Zhejiang Province, reads: "After Tangxi was liberated last May, we felt like we were seeing the light of day again. Under the leadership of the Communist Party People's Government, our village quickly organized Farmers' Associations, Village Political Associations, Women's Associations, and Youth Leagues. In last year's six major tasks of rent reduction, interest reduction, grain payment, and anti-bullying, we were very happy and worked hard to do them. We poor people have all turned over and have gained a lot of rice. These things only came after you and the Communist Party arrived. This spring, the government called for a great production movement. Under the leadership and education of the working comrades in the government, everyone, young and old, built dikes, reclaimed wasteland, and accumulated fertilizer. In the past six months, our village has built more than 500 zhang of river dikes and reclaimed 58 mu of wasteland. This year's spring and summer famines, caused by the reactionaries' oppression of the poor, were overcome by mutual lending and frugal living in the spirit of 'The poor of the world are one family'. Our autumn harvest this year has increased by 15%. The awareness of our farmers has been raised after a year of liberation. Everyone's minds have become clear, and everyone is happy to participate in various turnaround groups. There are now 208 members of the Farmers' Association, 196 members of the Women's Association, and 29 young men and women who have joined the Communist Youth League. Dearest Chairman Mao! Under your leadership, we have achieved happiness, so we guarantee that we will complete the autumn grain collection task this year. The whole village will complete it within three days and ensure that the land reform this winter is done without chaos and does not affect our production to repay you."

　　赣浙等省新区农民上书毛主席
    决心在今冬完成土地改革
    南昌小兰村农民公尧水来信
    【本报讯】江西、皖北、浙江等地新解放区许多农民上书毛主席，反映出过去在封建势力和蒋介石匪帮压迫宰割下的痛苦情形，解放后在毛主席领导下获得了自由并度过了灾荒的欢欣情绪，均决心尽全力于今冬完成土地改革，并永远跟着救星毛主席走，为创建美好康乐的未来而奋斗。信中溢露着农民真挚热诚的感情，兹摘要发表于后：江西省南昌县小兰村农民公尧水的信中说：“我是江西省南昌县小兰村一个贫农，我在国民党反动派的统治下，佃种田四亩五分，每年年成好可收谷十六石，交地主租谷九石、种子谷五斗、耕田谷一石，一年忙到头，除交租种子耕田以外，自得谷五石五斗，全家五口不能吃三个月。想做小生意卖水菜，那刮民党军队又要吃平价，少给钱，因此无有办法，只得帮人出卖零工，一天做到晚家中还是两顿吃不上。国民党反动政府下命令要抽壮丁，那些匪帮的爪牙保甲长得到命令，一个个如狼似虎，带了警察上户，我正二十二岁，合壮丁年龄，来到我家不容分说，只是要钱，每一壮丁派出银洋十六元，不给钱就抓人走，我听此言吓得浑身发抖，逼得没有办法，只得答应去借。我和母亲往地主家哀求借钱，东家说没有，西家怕我还不起，便连走了五家，到了专放高利贷的地主家，他说钱是有，不放钱，要放秋收的谷子，那时谷子五块钱买一石，他放二块五角钱，到秋收还谷一石。那时性命要紧，利钱再重也是要借，没有别的路可走，那一年出壮丁费，人头费几次，共借上谷二十多石，还是家中两餐吃不上，农民在这种的情况下，活一天就算一天。过了几个月，听说共产党打过长江了，军队多、计划好，打仗势如破竹，不到一月便把南昌解放了。解放后有工作同志来我村，宣传共产党人民军队的政策，组织农会，那时我便参加了。农会成立就实行减租减息，反封建恶霸、地主。我在这些斗争中，把我那一肚子冤枉气和一切的苦情，都放了出来，那封建恶霸地主，被斗得低了头，老老实实地认错了。这下子穷人出头了。以后就是秋征公粮了，我就先把自己应缴的公粮缴清，然后帮助农会坚决要把公粮任务完成，干得很是高兴。本村开始建团，我就申请入团，经上级团委批准我为正式团员，心中更觉高兴了。听团课，过团的生活，把我的政治觉悟进一步提高，坚决拥护共产党，响应政府的各种号召，愿带头去干。在今年春耕我精耕细作多积肥，选好种子。到夏秋时我种的六亩五分田，比去年多收粮二石五斗。并将荒地二亩种上西瓜、芝麻、红薯，也长得很好。家内还有织布机织布，这样男耕女织，生活一天天过好了。我想倘若没有共产党和毛主席的英明领导，没有人民政府的指示，穷人一辈子也翻不了身出不了头。现在我村实行土地改革，土地要还我家了，农村的封建地主恶霸打倒了，我们从此当家作主，个个心里都满意。
    伟大的毛主席，你真是人民的大救星，我们永远跟着你和中国共产党走，我们永远过着幸福快乐自由的日子了。”

    浙江杭县三墩区肇和乡及八字桥乡两地农民协会的信中说：“我们受了几千年的压迫和剥削，被压得透不过气来，每天起五更，睡半夜，总是饭不饱肚，衣不保暖。解放后，农民翻了身，我们知道自己当主人了，在您的英明领导下，我们每个人都加紧劳动，及时耕作，并且兴修了水利，开展了治虫运动及积肥等工作。依我们今年早稻的收成来讲，比去年要增加二、三成，估计晚稻的收入，也要比往年好，我们深信您的话，“生产发家，劳动光荣”。现在马上要土改了，我们向您保证，一定能够完成这一个历史上空前所未有的伟大任务，请您放心吧！”
