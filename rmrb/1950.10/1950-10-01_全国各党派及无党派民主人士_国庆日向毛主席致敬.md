    On this day of the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we would like to extend our heartfelt respect to you!
    Thanks to your wise leadership, the Chinese people have carried out a vigorous and earth-shattering national liberation cause. The Chinese people have repelled a century of imperialist aggression, overthrown thousands of years of feudal rule, and eliminated the exploitation of bureaucratic capital, liberating themselves from the shackles of poverty and oppression. In the year since the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1 last year, China has achieved unprecedented victories on the political, economic, military, and cultural fronts, laying the foundation for an independent, democratic, and happy New China.
    Thanks to your wise leadership, the Chinese people have become more united. Surrounding the Chinese Communist Party, they have fought unyieldingly for the cause of national liberation. All revolutionary classes, all democratic parties, groups, and all ethnic groups in the united front have all done their best to fulfill their responsibilities. We firmly believe that the concerted efforts and unity of the people of the whole country are a powerful guarantee for the liberation of the people and the construction of a new China.
    Thanks to your wise leadership, the Chinese people have gained great enlightenment in the entire ideological field and in revolutionary theory, making the Chinese people new people. The oppressed nations of Asian countries and the working people of the whole world are drawing on China's revolutionary experience to strengthen their revolutionary confidence in pursuing the light. The revolutionary doctrine of Marxism-Leninism has also been more powerfully proven and enriched due to the victory of the Chinese revolution and the victory of the world's peace and democracy movement.
    The entire Chinese people are fighting resolutely, happily, and excitedly for the new destiny of the Chinese people and the new destiny of mankind all over the world because of your correct leadership. Judging from the great achievements in the first anniversary of the founding of New China, the struggle of the Chinese people has achieved brilliant success. We will follow the path you have pointed out and forge ahead bravely. Please accept our warm and heartfelt respect.

    当中华人民共和国成立一周年的今天，我们谨向你致衷心的敬意！
    由于你英明的领导，中国人民轰轰烈烈的进行了旋乾转坤的民族解放事业，中国人民击退了百年来的帝国主义侵略，推翻了数千年来的封建统治，肃清了官僚资本的剥削，从贫穷，压榨的枷锁中，解放出来。自去年十月一日中华人民共和国成立以来这一年内，中国在政治、经济、军事、文化战线上，取得了史无前例的胜利，奠定了独立、民主、幸福的新中国的基础。
    由于你英明的领导，中国人民团结得更加巩固。围绕在中国共产党的周围，百折不挠的为民族解放事业而奋斗。各革命阶级各民主党派团体及各民族在统一战线中，都各尽力于他们所应尽的责任。我们坚决相信，全国人民的通力合作，团结一致，就是人民解放和新中国建设的有力保证。
    由于你英明的领导，中国人民在整个思想领域和革命理论方面，得到了巨大的启示，使中国人民成为新人。亚洲各国的被压迫民族及全世界的劳动人民正吸取中国的革命经验，来加强其追求光明的革命信心。马列主义的革命学说，亦因中国革命的胜利，及全世界和平民主运动的胜利，而得到更有力的证明，且更加丰富起来。
    全中国人民都因为你的正确领导，而在坚决的、愉快的、兴奋的为中国人民的新命运，为全世界人类的新命运而奋斗着。从新中国成立一周年内的伟大成绩看来，中国人民的奋斗，已获得辉煌的成就了。我们将遵循着你所指示的道路，奋勇前进。请你接受我们的热烈的衷心的敬意。
