　　Post Offices Widely Sell National Day Commemorative Stamps
    The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications specially issued three exquisitely printed commemorative stamps in celebration of the first anniversary of the founding of the country. At that time, due to the rush to print them, the Beijing Postal Administration Bureau received only one type with a face value of 800 yuan. Now, the complete set of stamps has been received, totaling five types with face values of 100 yuan, 400 yuan, 800 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and 2,000 yuan. They are now widely sold at all post offices in the city. The deadline for using the National Day commemorative postmark has been extended to the end of November this year.
