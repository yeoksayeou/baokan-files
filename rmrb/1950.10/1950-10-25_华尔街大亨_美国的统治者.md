　　Wall Street Tycoons - The Rulers of America
    Yinuo Jiemicefu
    Comrades Liebiejie夫(Liebiejiefu) (Kursk Oblast) and Bolianke夫(Boliankefu) (Velikiye Luki Oblast), readers of *News Bulletin*, request an explanation of the role of the giant monopolistic capitalists of the United States in American domestic and foreign policy.
    Comrade Stalin instructed: "Imperialism is the monopoly syndicates, trusts, banks, and financial oligarchies in the industrial countries that possess enormous power." (Stalin, *Problems of Leninism*, Moscow, 1948, Chinese edition, p. 22) In the United States, a parasitic and decadent capitalist country that heads the current reactionary and war camp, this is particularly evident. A small group of the most powerful financial and industrial tycoons in the United States control all political power and determine the domestic and foreign policies of American imperialism. American monopoly capital exerts its influence on the country primarily through the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM).
    This association was formed in the early stages of the development of capitalism to the monopoly stage. It was founded in 1895. Initially, it included 12,000 companies, whose enterprises employed 75 percent of the country's industrial workers. The NAM gradually developed many "daughter organizations," such as the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, the National Industrial Conference Board, the Manufacturers and Bankers Association, and so on. The NAM now formally unites approximately 16,000 companies, associations, and trusts, and is directly connected to 40,000 private companies. The Association has expanded its influence throughout the entire economic sphere of the United States and directs the U.S. government to implement its policies. According to the leaders of the NAM, the purpose of the Association is to "protect the interests of entrepreneurs throughout the United States." This flexible explanation means the struggle against the workers' movement, against the domestic and international progressive forces of America, and means a policy of preparing new wars for Wall Street to seize world hegemony.
    The head of the NAM is a small group of the most powerful American financial and industrial tycoons. According to the American press, the NAM's leading body is composed of representatives of twelve of the largest groups, such as Morgan's trusts "General Electric," "U.S. Steel," and "American Telephone & Telegraph," Rockefeller's "Standard Oil," DuPont's "General Motors," "U.S. Rubber," and "DuPont," Mellon's "Bethlehem Steel" and "Westinghouse Electric," etc.
    According to pamphlets published by the NAM, the leaders of the NAM "maintain daily contact with congressional leaders and heads of departments and bureaus, collecting information for their members and informing relevant administrative organs of the industrial groups' views on current issues." K. Kaiser, one of the leaders of the DuPont group, who manages the affairs of the NAM, declared in a moment of euphoria: "America is our country." Facts prove that this shameless statement has significant grounds.
    The NAM maintains the closest ties with the U.S. Republican and Democratic parties; its leaders are often the leaders of both parties. For example, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee was, for a time, Lescob. He is a director of the "DuPont" and "General Motors" concerns. Weir Hayes, who is associated with Morgan, and Scott, a large industrialist in Philadelphia, were leaders of the Republican Party. The party bosses in each state are all under the supervision of the NAM. Relying on the Association's large sums of money, these party bosses resort to any trickery to get the monopoly capital's lackeys into Congress and the state legislatures. The current U.S. Congress includes sixty-eight major manufacturers, thirteen bankers, and more than three hundred lawyers who serve in large corporations and banks.
    The NAM dictates the course of action for the American bourgeois press. American journalist Siders wrote: "As long as the leading group of the NAM has passed a resolution, before long, about ninety percent of the American newspapers begin to publicize the policies of the twelve trusts' billionaires and the 16,000 association members."
    The NAM uses its "shock troops"—groups similar to the Ku Klux Klan and the American Vigilantes, which are subordinate to the Association's top leadership and managed by Association members—to fight against the progressive forces within the United States. Twenty-six of the twenty-nine ringleaders of this Vigilante group are leaders of large industrial or financial enterprises, some are factory directors, and some are lawyers.
    The dictatorial role played by the NAM in all aspects of American life cannot even be concealed in official documents of the U.S. Congress. For example, the report of the Senate Committee La Follette-Thomas states: The NAM's twelve groups, the leadership committee of millionaires, "encouraged all strategies: from the use of spies, thugs, armed strikebreakers, tear gas, and machine guns to the formulation of congressional bills introduced in the names of senators and representatives."

    ※ ※ ※

    After World War II, the NAM's scope of activities further expanded. Undoubtedly, this was because the war further concentrated American economic power in the hands of the largest monopolistic capitalists, and further strengthened the alliance between monopolistic capital and state power organs.
    The most important point is that the destruction of fascism and the fragile situation of the capitalist world after World War II alarmed American imperialists and deepened the threat of an inevitable and imminent economic crisis. American monopoly capital then adopted a policy of preparing new wars, intending to rely on military adventures to realize its insane plan to turn the whole world into a colony of Wall Street.
    This plan of aggression was formulated at a special meeting organized by the NAM of sixty-six of the most prominent representatives of big capital, which was secretly convened in the small city of Absecon in October 1945. The leading figures at the meeting were Irénée du Pont, Winterbotham Aldrich, head of Rockefeller's "Chase Bank," and a confidant of Morgan.
    Since then, the NAM's annual congresses have drafted detailed instructions on American domestic and foreign policies, which are accurately implemented by the President, the State Department, and Congress.
    For example, the 51st Congress of the NAM, convened in December 1946, called for the implementation of a "tough foreign policy." The notorious Marshall Plan was conceived at the 52nd Congress in 1947.
    Subsequently, the leaders of the NAM demanded the "suppression" of trade unions in various countries—first of all, trade unions in France and Italy—and the strengthening of the struggle against democratic movements in countries receiving "American aid." This demand was met by the pressure exerted by the White House, the U.S. State Department, the Treasury Department, and other agencies on the governments of Western European countries. This pressure caused a surge of suppression of the workers' movement in the Marshallized countries.
    In December 1948, the 53rd Congress of the NAM passed many resolutions on directly inciting new wars. One of the leaders of the Association, Reed, chairman of Morgan's trust "General Electric," delivered a speech calling for the consolidation of "cooperation" between capitalist countries in the "world struggle against communism" by all means. This enthusiastic preacher of the new "Anti-Comintern Pact" proposed the establishment of an "international army" to fight against democratic forces. Reed said: "The natural and clear captain of this army is the United States." The embodiment of this "thought" is the North Atlantic aggressive treaty.
    The NAM also has great ruling power in American economic life. Under the pressure of industrial and financial capital giants, the country's entire economy is being rebuilt on military steps. Not long ago, the President's message to Congress regarding an additional appropriation of $10.5 billion for the purpose of expanding aggressive military preparations was directly related to a meeting of three hundred financial and industrial giants, which discussed the impact of the American "armed forces" on the interests of entrepreneurs.
    The more American giant monopoly capital strengthens militarization, the more it gradually places all domestic state organs under its direct supervision. The positions of Secretary of State, Secretaries of the Treasury, Commerce, and other departments, as well as the leadership of the Federal Bureau of Investigation—the American secret police organization—are all occupied by representatives of "big business." Wall Street merchants put on military uniforms and became military leaders. At the same time, generals of the Army and Navy are also serving the largest groups.
    The National Defense Committee and the National Security Resources Board established by the U.S. President in 1947 are by-products of the NAM. The President and the most important cabinet ministers participate in these two organs. The first chairman of the National Security Resources Board was Arthur Hill, who was the manager of several of Morgan's arms trusts. The current chairman is Symington, who is the manager of a large company that manufactures radio and electrical equipment and is also related to the Morgan Group.
    Under the jurisdiction of the National Defense Committee and the National Security Resources Board, there are many organs that are directly engaged in the arms race and war preparations, such as the National Munitions Board, the Atomic Energy Commission and its affiliated Industrial Advisory Committee, the Research and Improvement Committee, and the National Production Authority.
    Subordinate to the National Defense Committee are the armed forces (represented by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the leaders of the military departments), the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
    The domestic policy of the American ruling group is now aimed at preparing the rear for a new world war. This policy is also determined by the headquarters of monopoly capital—the NAM. President Truman's order on "loyalty checks" is a notable example. An American progressive journalist, John Spivak, in his pamphlet "Fascism in America," compared the full text of this order with the opinions provided by the Chamber of Commerce of the United States—a branch of the NAM. The President's order almost verbatim repeats the Chamber of Commerce's document.
    The history of the Taft-Hartley Act is also similar. The full text of this act, passed by Congress at that time, completely repeated the NAM's proposal on worker legislation.
    American modern foreign policy—the policy of imperialist aggression—is encouraged and directed by the giants of Wall Street.
    The struggle of the people of all nationalities for peace is a struggle to thwart the imperialists' misanthropic plans and to suppress the instigators of war. On the road of this struggle, more and more working people from all countries—including the United States—are participating. Opposing the forces of war and reaction are the great forces of peace and democracy, which are incomparably powerful.

### 华尔街大亨——美国的统治者

专栏：消息报答读者问

　　华尔街大亨——美国的统治者
    伊诺皆米采夫
    《消息报》的读者列别皆夫同志（库尔斯基州）和波梁科夫同志（大路克州）要求说明美国独占资本的巨头们在美国内外政策中的作用。
    斯大林同志指示说：“帝国主义就是工业国里垄断性的托辣斯新迪加，银行和财政寡头拥有莫大的势力。”（斯大林著《列宁主义问题》一九四八年莫斯科出版中文版第二十二页）在美国，这一个居于现在反动和战争阵营的首位的寄生的腐朽的资本主义国家，特别彰明昭著。美国最有权势的一小撮财政工业巨头，掌握着全部政权，确定着美帝国主义的内外政策。美国的独占资本，主要是通过制造商协会，贯彻自己对国家的影响的。
    这个协会的产生，是在资本主义发展到独占阶段的初期。它创立于一八九五。起初参加该会的共有一万二千个公司，属于这些公司的各项企业中的工人占全国企业工人百分之七十五。全国制造商协会逐渐发展了许多“儿女组织”，如美国商业公所，全国工业咨询会，制造商与银行家联谊会等等。现在全国制造商协会在形式上联合了约一万六千个公司、社团与托辣斯，并与各种私人公司四万个直接联系着。协会在美国整个经济界扩展了自己的势力，并责成美国政府实行它的政策。依照协会领导人的声明，协会的宗旨是“在全美国的范围内保护企业家的利益”。这个弹性的说明就意味着对工人运动，对美国国内的和国际的进步力量的斗争，意味着为华尔街争取世界霸权的准备新战争的政策。
    全国制造商协会的首脑是一小群最有势力的美国财政及工业巨头。据美国报刊的材料，全国制造商协会领导机关是由十二个最大的社团代表组成的，如摩根的托辣斯“通用电气公司”、“美国钢铁公司”和“美国电信公司”，洛克菲勒的“美孚油公司”，杜邦的“通用汽车公司”、“美国橡胶公司”与“杜邦公司”，梅隆的“伯利恒钢铁公司”和“西屋电气公司”等。
    根据协会出版的小册子，全国制造商协会的领导，“每天都保持着与国会领袖们、各部各局的领导者们的联系，为自己的会员们收集情报，并把工业集团对当前问题的观点告知有关的管理机关”。管理全国制造商协会事务的杜邦集团的领导人之一Ｋ·凯赛，在得意忘形中声明说：“美国是咱们的国家”。事实证明，这个无耻的声明是有其重大的根据的。
    全国制造商协会与美国共和党及民主党保有最密切的联系；它的首领们往往就是两党的领导者。例如，民主党全国委员会主席，有一个时期曾是莱斯科布。他是“杜邦公司”及“通用汽车公司”康采恩的董事之一。与摩根有联系的维尔·海斯和费城的大工业家斯考特曾是共和党的领导者。各州的党魁全都在全国制造商协会的监督之下。这些党魁凭借协会的大量金钱，不惜采用任何奸计，使独占资本的走狗进入国会及各州的立法机关中。美国现在的国会中，有六十八个大制造商，十三个银行家和三百多个在大公司及银行中服务的法律家。
    全国制造商协会指示着美国资产阶级报刊的行动方针。美国新闻记者赛德斯写道：“只要全国制造商协会的领导集团通过了决议，不一会，美国报纸百分之九十光景，就开始宣传十二个社团的亿万富翁和一万六千个协会会员的方针了。”
    全国制造商协会利用了自己的“突击队”——类似三Ｋ党及美国义勇团的、隶属于协会上层领导分子并由协会会员管理的团体——对美国内部的进步力量作斗争。这个义勇团的二十九个巨魁中，有二十六人是大工业或财政企业的领导人，有的是厂长，有的是律师。
    全国制造商协会在美国全部生活中所发生的独裁作用，甚至在美国国会的官方文件中也不能掩饰。例如，在参院委员会拉福莱特——汤姆斯的报告中说道：全国制造商协会的十二个社团，百万富翁的领导委员会，“鼓励一切方策：从利用间谍、强盗、武装的工贼、催泪性瓦斯和机枪以至于制订那些以参众两院的议员名义提出的国会法案。”
    ※      ※       ※
    第二次世界大战以后，全国制造商协会的活动范围更加扩大了。无疑，这件事是由于战争促使美国经济威力进一步集中在最大的独占资本家的手中，促使独占资本与国家政权机关的联合更加密切了。
    最主要的一点就在：法西斯的毁灭和第二次世界大战结束后资本主义世界的脆弱形势，引起了美帝国主义者们的惊慌，使不可避免的迫近了的经济危机的威胁加深。美国的独占资本于是采取了准备新战争的方针，打算依靠军事冒险，实现其变全世界为华尔街殖民地的疯狂计划。
    这个侵略方案是在全国制造商协会所组织的六十六个最著名的大资本代表的特别会议上制订的，这个会议曾于一九四五年十月，在阿布塞肯这一个小城市中秘密召开。会议的领导人物就是伊兰涅·杜邦、洛克菲勒“大通银行”的头子温特罗甫·奥尔瑞奇和摩根的一个亲信。
    此后，全国制造商协会每年的代表大会，都对美国的内外政策拟就了详细的训令，交由总统、国务院和国会准确地予以执行。
    例如，一九四六年十二月召开的全国制造商协会第五十一次代表大会，要求施行“强硬的对外政策”。一九四七年的第五十二次代表大会上，就酝酿了臭名远扬的马歇尔计划。
    此后，全国制造商协会的领导者们要求“镇压”各国职工会——首先是法国及意大利的职工会——并加强对“美援”国家中民主运动的斗争。答应这项要求的就是白宫、美国国务院、财政部及其他机关对西欧各国政府所施的压力。这种压力在马歇尔化的国家中，引起了镇压工人运动汹涌浪潮。
    一九四八年十二月，全国制造商协会第五十三次代表大会通过了许多关于直接挑拨新战争的决议。协会的领导人之一，摩根的托辣斯“通用电气公司”的董事长雷德，曾发表演说，号召用一切方法巩固资本主义国家间在“反对共产主义的世界斗争”中的“合作”。这位新的“反对共产国际的联盟”的热心传道者，提议建立一支“国际军队”以与民主力量斗争。雷德说：“这支军队的当然的，明确的队长，就是美国。”这种“思想”的体现，就是北大西洋侵略公约。
    全国制造商协会在美国的经济生活中也有很大的统治势力。在工业和财政资本巨头的压力之下，国家的全部经济重建在军事步骤之上。不久以前，总统致国会的关于附加拨款一百零五亿美元，以作扩张侵略的军事准备之用的咨文，是与三百个财政、工业巨头的会议有直接联系的，这个会议曾讨论了美国“武装力量”对企业家利益的影响问题。
    美国庞大的独占资本愈是加强军国主义化，就愈使国内全部国家机关逐渐置于自己的直接监督之下。国务卿，财政、贸易等部的部长职位以及联邦调查局——美国的秘密警察组织——的首领职位，全都由“大企业”的代表占据着。华尔街的商人们披上了军服做军事首长。同时陆海军的大将们也在为最大的社团服务。
    美国总统在一九四七年所建立的国防委员会与国家资源安全局，均是全国制造商协会的副产物。参加这两机关的是总统与最重要的各部部长。国家资源安全局的第一任主席曾是阿尔都尔·席尔，他是摩根的几个军火托辣斯的管理人。现在的主席是薛明顿，他是一家制无线电与电料器材的大公司的经理，与摩根集团也有联系。
    在国防委员会与国家资源安全局的管辖下，有许多机关都直接从事军备竞赛与战争准备，如全国军备委员会、原子能委员会及其附属的工业咨询委员会，调查及改良委员会，全国生产处等。
    隶属于国防委员会的有军队（以参谋部的首脑与军事部门的领导者的联合集团为代表），中央谍报局和联邦调查局。
    美国统治集团现在的国内政策，是以准备新世界战争的后方为目的。这一政策也是由独占资本的总部——全国制造商协会来确定的。杜鲁门总统关于“忠诚的检查”的命令，就是一个值得指出的例子。美国的一位进步的新闻记者约翰·斯比克在“美国的法西斯主义”小册子中，将这个命令的全文与美国商业公所——全国制造商协会分会之一——所提供的意见对照了一下。总统的命令几乎是逐字地重复着商业公所的文件。
    塔虎脱——哈莱法案的历史也是如此。国会当时所通过的这一法案全文，完全重复着全国制造商协会所制订的关于工人立法的提议。
    美国现代的对外政策——帝国主义侵略的政策——由华尔街的巨头们鼓励着，指示着方向。
    各族人民争取和平的斗争，就是为了挫败帝国主义者憎恨人类的计划的斗争，就是为了镇压战争煽动者的斗争。在这个斗争的道路上，有各国——美国也在内——的许多新而又新的劳动群众参加着。与战争及反动势力对立着就是强大得无可比拟的和平与民主的伟大力量。
