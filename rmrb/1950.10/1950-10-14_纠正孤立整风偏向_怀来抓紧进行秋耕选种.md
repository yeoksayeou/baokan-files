　　Correcting the Deviation of Isolated Rectification
　　Huailai Hastens Autumn Cultivation and Seed Selection
　　[Report from this newspaper] According to the Chahar Daily News: Huailai County, Chahar Province, has corrected the deviation of disassociating rectification from the "Three Autumns" work (see page three of this newspaper on September 25th). After discovering this problem, the county leadership immediately dispatched a large number of cadres to the countryside to seize the leadership of the "Three Autumns" work. The situation has now changed. Regarding autumn cultivation, all villages have convened symposiums for livestock-raising households, explaining methods such as freely setting wage rates and discussing the settlement of outstanding wages from last year's autumn cultivation. In the fifth district, forty-one villages held symposiums for livestock owners and, after resolving the issues of outstanding wages and joint plowing, thirty-three villages have already harnessed 104 teams of draft animals, plowing over 2,200 mu of autumn land. Chenjiapu Village in the seventh district has also harnessed 34 teams of draft animals to begin plowing. The county and district cadres leading autumn cultivation have adopted the method of a comprehensive autumn cultivation accounting: calculating the livestock and land in the entire village, how many teams can be assembled, how many days it will take to complete plowing, and estimating what methods should be adopted to remedy any uncompleted work. Gucheng Village in the fifth district calculated that it would take a month to complete all the plowing. Everyone felt that if they didn't work hard, they wouldn't be able to complete it, overcoming the village cadres' and the masses' lack of urgency. Currently, the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses is high, and villages and districts are engaging in enthusiastic autumn cultivation challenge competitions. In terms of seed selection, after a vigorous campaign, most villages have implemented field seed selection; households that have not selected seeds in the field have mostly exchanged seven sheng of rice for one dou of millet seed from unharvested households. Except for a few villages selecting seeds in the threshing ground, most villages have selected enough millet seeds in the fields for next year's use. Various places are currently selecting sorghum seeds.

　　纠正孤立整风偏向
    怀来抓紧进行秋耕选种
    【本报讯】据察哈尔日报消息：察哈尔省怀来县整风和三秋工作脱节的偏向（见九月二十五日本报三版）已进行纠正。县领导机关发现这一问题后，立即抽调大批干部下乡，抓紧领导三秋工作，现在情况已经改变。在秋耕工作方面，各村都召开了养牲口户座谈会，解释了自由订定工价等办法，并讨论了清理去年秋耕中的旧欠工资问题。五区四十一个村子开了牲畜主座谈会，解决了旧欠工资与合犋等问题之后，已有三十三个村套起耕畜一百零四犋，耕了两千二百余亩秋地。七区陈家铺村也套起了三十四犋耕畜开始耕地。下乡领导秋耕的县、区干部采用了秋耕大算账的办法：计算全村的牲畜、土地，能搭多少犋，多少日期可耕完，估计耕不完的该采取什么方法补救等。五区古城村算出了须要一个月才能全部耕完，大家感到如果抓不紧就不能完成，克服了村干部与群众的不着忙思想。目前干部、群众情绪高涨，村与村、区与区展开热烈的秋耕挑战竞赛。在选种方面，经过大力突击，大多数村都实行了田间选种；未在田间选种的户，多以七升米换一斗谷种的办法向未收割户实行了兑换，除少数村庄在场里选种外，大部村庄都在田间选够明年用的谷种现各地正在选高粱种。
