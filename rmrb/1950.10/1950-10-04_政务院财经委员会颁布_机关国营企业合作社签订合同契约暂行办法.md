Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The "Provisional Measures for Signing Contracts and Agreements between Government Agencies, State-Owned Enterprises, and Cooperatives," formulated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, has been approved and promulgated for implementation by the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council. The full text of the measures is as follows:

Article 1: These measures are formulated to promote normal business relationships between government agencies, state-owned enterprises, cooperatives, and other departments, to prevent one party from undermining credit, causing losses to the other party, and thus affecting the progress of economic plans.

Government agency production that has the conditions for enterprise management and operates independently is included within state-owned enterprises.

Article 2: When there are major business transactions between government agencies, state-owned enterprises, and cooperatives that cannot be settled immediately, such as loans, agency collection and payment, goods sales, custom goods, barter trade, entrusted sales, entrusted processing, entrusted lending of funds or in-kind goods, entrusted transportation, repair and construction, lease operation, joint venture operation, etc., a contract must be signed, and a copy of the original contract must be sent to the local People's Bank. With the local People's Bank as the clearing center, each payment and receipt for the fulfillment of the contract must be made using People's Bank checks.

The foregoing provisions regarding settlement through the People's Bank and the use of People's Bank checks for payment and receipt are limited to units subject to the People's Bank's cash management.

Article 3: When government agencies, state-owned enterprises, and cooperatives apply for loans from banks, they should have a business plan and financial plan approved by the higher-level agency or responsible agency, and a contract must be signed.

Article 4: The content of contracts and agreements must be specific and detailed, and the interpretation of the text should be as definitive and clear as possible.

Article 5: The signing of contracts or agreements must be with legal persons as the object and their responsible person as the representative, and not with individuals as the object. The refusal to perform the contract due to changes in the responsible person is not permitted. Contracts and agreements must be included in the handover when the responsible person of each unit is transferred.

Article 6: Bank loan contracts should be based on having collateral in principle. However, for loans stipulated in the national construction plan, and where it is impossible to provide collateral in fact, the loan unit's superior agency or responsible agency shall provide a guarantee. The contract should have a guarantor. The guarantor should be the guaranteed party's superior agency or responsible agency in principle. In special circumstances, other agencies, state-owned enterprise units, or cooperatives may serve as guarantors.

For large loan contracts and important contracts of central-level agencies, the Ministry of Finance may provide a guarantee.

The guarantor is responsible for supervising the performance of the contract or agreement.

Article 7: Modifications to the contract or agreement, or failure to perform it due to unforeseen circumstances, must be with the written consent of both parties and the guarantor to be valid.

Article 8: If one party fails to perform the contract or agreement after it is signed, causing losses to the other party, it shall be liable for compensation, and the guarantor shall be jointly and severally liable.

Article 9: After the contract or agreement is signed, it must be reported to the directly subordinate agency and the directly leading Financial and Economic Committee for the record, and a copy sent to the corresponding financial department for filing. A summary catalog of bank loan contracts should be submitted.

Article 10: After the contract or agreement is signed, if one party fails to perform or breaches the contract or agreement without the consent of the other party, and both parties concerned are within the jurisdiction of the same major administrative region (such as being in the same province or city in North China), the other party may request the directly leading Financial and Economic Committee to handle it; if the two parties are not within the same major administrative region or the same province or city, the other party may request the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council to handle it. If the handling is ineffective, the other party may file a lawsuit with the People's Court.

Article 11: These measures shall be submitted by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council to the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council for approval and promulgation for implementation.
