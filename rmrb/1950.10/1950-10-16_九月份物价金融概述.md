　　September Price and Financial Overview
　　Price
　　Yang Fangxun
　　Under the planned adjustment and control of the People's Government, prices in September were more stable and rational than in July and August. According to the chain relative index of 25 major commodities in major administrative regions across the country: the average increase in September was 1.7%, while it was 7.3% in July and 3% in August.
　　Imported goods, which had risen sharply in July and August, gradually stabilized in September. For example, the import price index in Tianjin rose by 9% in August, but only by 5% in September. However, individual commodities among imported goods also rose sharply. For example, the price of dinitrobenzene, the main raw material for manufacturing vulcanized green, increased by more than double in Shanghai and by 75% in Tianjin from the beginning to the end of September. The price of vulcanized green therefore rose sharply. In Xi'an, the price of vulcanized green was 1.32 million per barrel on September 1st and 2.27 million on September 30th, an increase of 72%. The reasons for the increase in the price of dinitrobenzene are the imperialist blockade and the peak season for pigments in autumn. The state-owned import companies in some regions underestimated the market demand for dinitrobenzene and were insufficiently prepared, creating a gap for unscrupulous merchants to take the opportunity to drive up prices, which is also one of the reasons for the increase in the price of dinitrobenzene. How to stabilize import prices remains a major task for state-owned trading departments in stabilizing prices in the future.
　　In order to make the parity between industrial and agricultural products, regional price differences, and the cotton-grain parity more reasonable, the Central Ministry of Trade actively adjusted prices in September. After the adjustment of the trade company's listed prices, the market prices also changed slightly with the listed prices, and the market transaction situation was still normal. According to recent materials, all regions have achieved results in adjusting prices. The first is that the parity between cotton and grain is close to reasonable. After new cotton and new grain were put on the market in August, an unreasonable cotton-grain exchange ratio once occurred. After the government's active adjustment, it has now improved. For example, in Baoding, one jin of cotton could be exchanged for 9.15 jin of millet on August 30th, and 8.14 jin on September 22nd; in Shijiazhuang, one jin of cotton could be exchanged for 12.12 jin of millet on August 30th, and 8.1 jin on September 22nd. This is close to the parity of 8 to 10 jin of millet for one jin of cotton stipulated by the government in the North China region this spring.
　　In September, new cotton, new grain, and other agricultural and sideline products were put on the market in large quantities. In order to organize public and private forces to carry out procurement in a planned way, so as to balance the supply and demand of raw cotton and avoid blind purchases, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Joint Public-Private Cotton Purchase and Cotton Market Management" on September 2nd. Past experience has proved that organizing joint procurement is an important measure to ensure reasonable supply of raw cotton and prevent blind competition.
　　In order to encourage private merchants to go to the countryside to purchase local products, state-owned trading companies, transportation companies, and state banks and cooperatives all provided assistance and care. For example, the People's Bank expanded the acceptance of drafts network to provide financial assistance to private merchants for procurement. When state-owned native product companies and private merchants purchase in the same area, private merchants are given priority; cooperatives also sell the best goods to private merchants; and transportation companies also take the initiative to allocate vehicles to private merchants. This has increased the enthusiasm of private merchants for procurement. For example, Tianjin Taifenghao has purchased more than 1.6 million catties of Ya pears in Hebei and transported them to Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places.
　　Finance
　　The financial situation in September has the following characteristics and problems:
　　1. Deposits, loans, and remittance businesses of public and private banks continued to increase. The total amount of deposits in state-owned banks at the end of September increased by 8% compared with the end of August, the total amount of loans at the end of September increased by 22% compared with the end of August, and the total amount of remittances in late September increased by 44% compared with late August. In terms of private banks, according to statistics from seven major cities: the amount of deposits at the end of September increased by 5% compared with the end of August, and the amount of loans at the end of September increased by 22% compared with the end of August.
　　The development of financial business is due to the improvement of industry and commerce and the active exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. In addition, the efforts of banks to operate (such as the Tianjin Jincheng and Dalu banks launching a red flag competition to attract deposits) have also achieved considerable results.
　　2. The relationship between the financial industry and industry and commerce in Tianjin is becoming increasingly close. The various decisions of the National Financial Industry Joint Conference in August this year are being gradually implemented in Tianjin. The city has organized a financial committee, and in late September, the heads of more than 40 industries such as hardware and wool spinning, as well as public and private banks and money shops, jointly discussed and proposed preliminary methods for close financial and industrial and commercial relations. The Tianjin Public-Private Banking Consortium established a planning committee on September 20th to strengthen the planning of loans; and has formulated a loan plan for September and October, focusing on weaving and dyeing, hardware manufacturing, grain processing, chemical raw materials and dyes, mountain products, dried goods, sugar, groceries and import and export trade. The Tianjin Banking and Money Industry Interest Rate Committee also decided to appropriately reduce interest rates, which is beneficial to local industry and commerce and the financial industry itself.
　　3. The business of private banks in Shanghai has deviated. In order to overcome difficulties, the private financial industry in Shanghai has successively organized joint venture groups, and its deposit and loan business has also increased month by month, which is a good phenomenon; but recently there has been a tendency for blind competition, which should be noted and corrected. The deviation is manifested in the lack of close contact and planning in terms of loans: for example, the first joint venture group lent 500 million yuan to Zhenfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory; the second joint venture group also lent 500 million yuan to the factory; and seven group members (banks and money shops) in the first group lent 950 million yuan to the factory. In addition, some banks have over-extended credit loans beyond the legal limit, resulting in insufficient cash reserves. This shows the blindness of loans. Secondly, there is also a tendency for blind competition in attracting deposits, which is manifested in giving customers huge overdrafts as a condition for attracting deposits (the Financial Industry Association has stipulated that the overdraft amount given to customers by public and private banks shall not exceed 5 million yuan to prevent credit expansion); some do not follow the prescribed interest rates and increase interest rates without authorization, such as the interest rate on Type A current deposits once exceeded the prescribed 50%. In addition, there are individual banks that use methods such as increasing staff, entertaining guests, and "business allowance" bonuses to attract deposits in the name of streamlining, which are all unscrupulous and blind competition.
　　The National Financial Industry Joint Conference in August this year pointed out the development prospects and new directions for private banks; but the implementation of the various decisions of the conference still requires the continued efforts of private banks to steadily develop their business. If you only see a temporary improvement and get carried away, it will create many difficulties again. This should arouse the attention and vigilance of private banks.
　　4. After prices stabilized in March this year, the credit of the RMB improved, and the masses were happy to use it; according to recent materials, the circulation area is gradually expanding. However, the phenomenon of barter trade and silver dollar circulation still exists in many places. For example, in Huaxian County, Pingyuan Province, currency transactions account for only two-fifths of the total, and barter trade accounts for three-fifths; in the urban area of ​​Jiaxiang, 30% of the transactions in various industries use silver dollars. The reason for this phenomenon is mainly due to the shortage of RMB in rural areas, which is not enough for circulation. After the autumn harvest, the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas is active. All regions have paid attention to organizing public and private merchants to purchase local products in large quantities. At the same time, attention should also be paid to promoting currency to the countryside in a planned way to expand the RMB's position in rural areas.

　　九月份物价金融概述
    物价
    杨方勋
    在人民政府有计划地调整与掌握下，九月份的物价较七、八两月更加稳定与趋于合理。根据全国各大行政区二十五种主要商品环比指数来看：九月份平均上涨百分之一点七，七月份却上涨百分之七点三，八月份上涨百分之三。
    七、八月份上涨幅度较大的进口货，至九月份渐趋稳定。如天津进口物价指数八月上涨百分之九，九月只上涨百分之五。但进口货中亦有个别商品猛涨。如制造硫化青的主要原料二硝基的价格，以九月底与九月初比较，上海上升一倍多，天津上升百分之七十五。硫化青价因而随之猛涨。西安九月一日硫化青每桶一百三十二万，三十日二百二十七万，上涨百分之七十二。二硝基涨价的原因是帝国主义的封锁与秋季颜料旺销。某些地区的国营进口公司，对市场上二硝基的需要量估计不够，准备不足，给奸商造成乘机哄抬的空隙，也是二硝基涨价的原因之一。如何稳定进口物价，仍是今后国营贸易部门在稳定物价工作上的一大任务。
    为了使工农业产品的比价、地区差价和棉粮比价趋于合理，中央贸易部于九月份主动调整了物价。贸易公司牌价调整后，市场价格亦随牌价稍有变动，市场交易情况，仍属正常。根据最近材料，各地调整物价均获得成绩，首先是棉花与粮食的比价接近合理。八月份新棉新粮上市后，曾一度发生棉粮交换比率不合理的现象，经过政府积极调整，现已有好转。如保定八月三十日一斤棉花换小米九斤十五两，九月二十二日换八斤十四两；石家庄八月三十日一斤棉花换小米十二斤十二两，九月二十二日换八斤一两。这和今春政府规定华北区一斤棉花换八斤至十斤小米的比价相接近。
    九月份新棉、新粮和其他农、副业产品均大量上市。为了组织公私的力量，有计划地进行收购，使原棉供需平衡，避免盲目争购，中央人民政府贸易部于九月二日发布了“关于公私联合购棉及棉花市场管理的指示”。过去经验证明，组织联合采购，是保证合理供应原棉和防止盲目竞争的重要措施。
    为了鼓励私商下乡收购土产品，国营贸易公司、运输公司、国家银行、合作社等均予帮助与照顾。如人民银行扩大押汇网，对私商采购予以资金扶助。国营土产公司与私商在同一地区收购时，尽先让私商采购；合作社也把上选的货卖给私商；运输公司也主动为私商配车。这样提高了私商采购的积极性。如天津泰丰号已在河北采购鸭梨一百六十余万斤，运往上海、广州等地。
    金融
    九月份的金融情况，有下列特点与问题：
    一、公私银行存款、放款、汇兑等业务继续增加。国家银行九月底存款总额较八月底增加百分之八，放款总额九月底较八月底增加百分之二十二，汇兑总额九月下旬较八月下旬增加百分之四十四。私营行庄方面，根据七大城市统计：存款额九月底较八月底增加百分之五，放款额九月底较八月底增加百分之二十二。
    金融业务的开展，一方面是由于工商业的好转和城乡物资交流的活跃，另外行庄努力经营（如天津金城、大陆等银行展开揽存款红旗竞赛等）也收到相当成绩。
    二、天津金融业与工商业的关系日益密切。今年八月全国金融业联席会议的各项决定，天津正在逐步实现。该市已组织金融委员会，并于九月下旬由五金、毛纺等四十余行业和公私银行钱庄负责人，共同商议提出密切金融业和工商业关系的初步办法。天津公私营银行业联合银团于九月二十日成立了计划委员会，以加强放款的计划性；并已制定九、十两月放款计划，以织染、五金制造、粮食加工、化学原料和染料、山、乾、糖、杂等业和进出口贸易为重点。天津银钱业利率委员会并决定适当降低利息，这对当地工商业和金融业本身都是有利的。
    三、上海私营行庄业务发生偏向。上海私营金融业为了度过困难，曾先后组织联营集团，其存放款业务也逐月增加，这是好的现象；但最近却发生盲目竞争的偏向，应当注意与纠正。其偏向表现在放款方面的是缺乏严密的联系和计划：如第一联营集团以五亿元贷给震丰染织厂；第二联营集团亦以五亿元贷给该厂；第一集团内又有七家团员（行庄）以九亿五千万元贷给该厂。又有若干行庄信用放款超过法定限制，发生付现准备金不足现象。这都表现出放款的盲目性。其次，在吸收存款方面，也发生盲目竞争的偏向，表现在对客户予以巨额透支作为吸引存款的条件（金融业同业公会为防止信用膨胀，已规定公私行庄给客户的透支额，每户不得超过五百万元）；有的不按规定利率，擅自加息，如甲种活期存款利率曾超过规定百分之五十等。此外尚有个别行庄在精简声中，竟利用增加营业员、请客、“业务津贴”奖金等方式招揽存款，这都是不择手段，盲目竞争的不良现象。
    今年八月份全国金融业联席会议给私营银钱业指出了发展前途与新的方向；但会议上各项决定的贯彻，尚须私营银钱业继续努力，才能使行庄业务稳步开展。如果只看见一时的好转而冲昏头脑，是会重新造成许多困难的，这一点应引起私营行庄的注意与警惕。
    四、今年三月物价平稳后，人民币信用提高，群众乐用；根据最近材料来看，流通地区日渐扩大。但不少地方以物易物和银元流通的现象仍然存在。如平原省滑县共十四个区，货币交易仅占五分之二，物物交换占五分之三；嘉祥城内各行业交易中，百分之三十用银元。产生此种现象之原因，主要由于农村人民币缺少，不够流通。秋收后城乡物资交流活跃，各地已注意组织公私商人大量收购土产，同时亦应注意有计划的推行货币下乡，扩大人民币在农村的阵地。
