　　Factories as Battlefields, Machines as Weapons, Strengthening the Power to Resist American Imperialist Aggression
    Liu Maoyou
    American imperialism's violation of our country's territory and airspace, and its shooting of our compatriots, is simply the act of a mad dog. Now the people of the world have united, and no aggression by American imperialism can frighten us. We, the working class, all recognize that the working people are the masters of the new China. The unity of workers, peasants, and soldiers is an invincible force.
    This time when I went to Beijing for a meeting, I saw Chairman Mao. At that time, I was truly moved, and I felt like my heart had blossomed. Chairman Mao instructed us to work hard to strengthen our studies, improve our cultural and technical levels, and strengthen national defense and economic construction. I am determined that from now on I will definitely strive forward according to Chairman Mao's instructions, unite even more vigorously with everyone, improve production, use our brains more, protect and extend the life of the large kiln, and guarantee glass production. We plan to exceed the production equivalent to 40 percent of the annual task by the end of the year, and save 2.5 billion yuan in expenses for the whole year.
    Recently, due to American imperialism's frenzied expansion of the war of aggression, our peaceful construction is seriously threatened. Our factory has now launched a production competition, using production achievements to strengthen the power to resist American aggression. Workshops and shifts have all formulated production plans to ensure increased output, improved quality, reduced costs, and the elimination of waste. We will treat the factory as a battlefield, machines as weapons, strengthen our power, and consolidate national defense.

　　工厂当战场，机器当武器，增强反抗美帝侵略的力量
    刘茂有
    美帝侵犯我国领土领空，并射杀我同胞，简直是一只疯狗。现在全世界人民已团结起来，美帝的任何侵略，也吓不住我们。我们工人阶级都认识到，劳动人民是新中国的主人翁。工农兵团结在一起，力量是无比的。
    这次我去北京开会，见到了毛主席。当时，我真感动极了，觉得心里像开了花一样。毛主席指示我们，要努力加强学习，提高文化，提高技术水平，加强国防和经济建设。我下定决心，今后一定根据毛主席的指示来努力前进，更加劲地和大家团结起来，把生产搞好，多动用脑筋，保护和延长大窑的寿命，保证玻璃产量。计划到年底超过生产相等于全年任务的百分之四十，全年节省经费二十五亿元。
    最近由于美帝疯狂扩大侵略战争，严重地威胁着我们的和平建设。现在我们厂已开展了生产竞赛，以生产成绩，加强反对美国侵略的力量。车间与车间、班与班，都订出了生产计划，保证提高产量，提高质量，降低成本，消灭浪费，把工厂当战场，把机器当武器，增强力量，巩固国防。
