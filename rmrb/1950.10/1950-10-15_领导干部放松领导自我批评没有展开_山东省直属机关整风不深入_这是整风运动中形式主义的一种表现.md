Leading Cadres Relaxed, Leadership Self-Criticism Not Expanded
    Shandong Province's Directly Subordinate Organs' Rectification Not Thorough
    This is a Manifestation of Formalism in the Rectification Movement
    [This newspaper dispatch] According to the Shandong Dazhong Daily: The work inspection of provincial direct organs and departments in Shandong Province's rectification movement has come to an end, and is now entering the work inspection stage at the division and section levels. Some units have also completed the work inspection at the division and section levels, and are now entering the stage of universal inspection. The entire inspection stage is nearing completion. However, in this process, with the exception of a few units where the inspection was more serious and thorough, the work inspection in general units had a general, non-specific, character. This is a manifestation of formalism in the rectification movement. The summary reports of many departments are still stuck on general, principled inspections and exposures of bureaucracy, not specific or profound, failing to better connect with the reality of work and the reality of thought, and therefore are painless and superficial. The most prominent manifestation of this is that many summary reports are filled with empty reviews such as "insufficient," "has shortcomings," "not very good," "great losses," and "extremely harmful," but rarely expose specific examples of the serious harm that bureaucracy has caused to the cause of the Party and the people, or find the causes and improvement methods from the laws of actual cases. For example, in the summary report of the Shandong Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China, it only vaguely stated that the CCP sent and received 2,570 official documents in August, without specifically analyzing which were necessary, which were unnecessary, and what the bad consequences were. In the same report, the review of caring for state property also lacked specific examples, only vaguely saying that "the number of losses in the past six months is quite large," but how large is it? It is not known. Secondly, many units reflected that the inspection and summary work could not be deepened, and criticism and self-criticism could not be developed between leading cadres, between cadres of the same level, and between superiors and subordinates. Many concerns still exist in the minds of cadres. Some are unable to break through concerns for personal feelings, fearing that criticizing others will affect relationships; some see that leading cadres lack a strict spirit of self-criticism in their review reports, and therefore doubt whether suggestions can improve the leadership; some push their own problems to objective factors during the inspection work, evading responsibility. For example, the Propaganda Section of the Propaganda Department of the Shandong Branch Bureau of the CCP, after inspecting the shortcomings in its work, analyzed three reasons: First, the department leaders are not specific enough; second, the organizational structure is unsound; and third, the cadres are not active enough. It seems that the leadership of the Propaganda Section has no responsibility at all. Third, after the department work inspection, leading cadres in many units generally breathed a sigh of relief, thinking that they had passed this hurdle, and that future good or bad was a matter for subordinates, thus relaxing leadership, resulting in a common phenomenon of tightening up before and loosening up later in the leadership of the rectification movement. The Shandong Provincial Government Rectification Committee held a meeting on October 4th to convey and discuss the opinions of the expanded meeting of the Rectification General Assembly on September 28th. When arranging the work for the next stage, only four of the seventeen committee members of the sub-committee attended. The main responsible cadres of the Industry Department, the Civil Affairs Department, the Bank, and the Labor Bureau did not participate, but only sent representatives to attend. After the director of the Shandong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles attended the expanded meeting of the General Assembly, he hastily made a summary report of the department's work based on everyone's opinions. After that, he abandoned the leadership of the rectification of the unit, and took a few cadres to Beijing for the National Day holiday, and did not return until the 7th, causing the rectification to lose leadership. After the director of the Provincial Health Department made a summary report, he did not participate in leading the rectification, causing the rectification of the department to stagnate. After the leadership of the Finance Department completed the inspection, the leading cadres of the department relaxed ideologically, causing the leading cadres of the Taxation Bureau to not make a summary report, but first let the comrades below give their opinions, and then print and distribute everyone's opinions, considering that the inspection of the leadership of the bureau was complete. The director of the Expenditure Management Office's summary report had no self-criticism, only criticizing the general cadres for being incorrect. After the above problems occurred, Vice Director Wang of the department began to pay attention to helping correct them. Why is this serious situation happening! The basic reason is that the understanding of rectification is insufficient. It is not as Chairman Mao pointed out in the report of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, to "improve the ideological and political level of cadres and general party members by reading certain designated documents, summarizing work, analyzing situations, and launching criticism and self-criticism," but it is considered as "passing a hurdle," resulting in generalized formalism. The manifestations are: First, after the department inspection came to an end, most department leading cadres breathed a sigh of relief ideologically and relaxed leadership, failing to implement the principle of the chief leader being responsible and personally taking action throughout the entire rectification process. Second, there is a lack of further mobilization and education for middle-level cadres, and middle-level cadres have failed to play the backbone role they should have played in the inspection and summary work. Third, there is no continuous ideological mobilization based on the gradual deepening of the movement; in the inspection and summary work, there is generally no combination of learning certain documents, resulting in the phenomenon of having no standards and no way to start. Fourth, from leading cadres to general cadres, there is a general lack of self-criticism spirit, ideological struggle cannot be well developed, and inspection work cannot be organically linked with personal ideological style.
    The Provincial Rectification General Assembly believes when studying the above situation: This is a serious situation in the current rectification movement. If it is not resolved well, the entire rectification movement is in danger of failing. In order to change the above situation, the Rectification General Assembly decided to strengthen the leadership of the three rectification sub-committees of the provincial direct organs. It requires each sub-committee and each branch to specifically inspect and analyze the specific reasons why the current rectification movement in its affiliated units is not deepening, find the basic key, make specific and feasible improvement methods, and effectively change the serious situation of the current rectification movement.

### 领导干部放松领导自我批评没有展开  山东省直属机关整风不深入  这是整风运动中形式主义的一种表现

　　领导干部放松领导自我批评没有展开
    山东省直属机关整风不深入
    这是整风运动中形式主义的一种表现
    【本报讯】据山东大众日报消息：山东省整风运动中省直各机关部门工作检查目前已告一段落，正在进入处、科一级的工作检查。部分单位并已结束了处、科一级的工作检查，正在进入普遍检查。整个检查工作阶段接近结束。但是在这一过程中，除少数单位的检查比较认真深入外，一般单位的工作检查都存在一般化的毛病。这是整风运动中形式主义的一种表现。很多部门的综合报告都还停留在泛泛的、一般原则的检查和揭发官僚主义上，不具体，不深刻，未能更好的接触工作实际和思想实际，因而也就不疼不痒，轻描淡写，其中最突出的表现就是在很多综合报告中充满了“不够”、“有缺点”、“不大好”、“损失很大”、“危害甚巨”等空洞检讨，但却很少揭发官僚主义对党和人民事业严重危害的具体事例以及从实际事例的规律中找出原因及其改进办法。例如在中国人民银行山东省行的综合报告中，只笼统地提出八月份中共收发公文二千五百七十件，而没有具体分析其中那些是必要的，那些是不必要的，其恶果又怎样？同一报告中，对国家资财的爱护检讨上，也无具体事例，只笼统地说“半年来的损失数字相当大”，究竟有多么大呢？并不知道。其次，很多单位反映检查总结工作深入不下去，领导干部之间、同级干部之间、上下级之间批评和自我批评展不开。干部思想中仍存在许多顾虑。有的打不破情面，怕批评别人影响了关系；有的看到领导干部在检讨报告中缺乏严格自我批评精神，因而怀疑提意见能否改进领导；有的在检查工作中将自身的问题推诸客观，逃避责任，例如中共山东分局宣传部宣传科在检查了工作中的缺点之后，分析原因有三点：一是部门领导不具体，二是组织机构不健全，三是干部不积极。好像宣传科领导上没有一点责任一样。第三，很多单位在部门工作检查之后，主要领导干部普遍松了一口气，认为自己这一关过去了，以后好坏是下面的事情了，因而放松领导，使整风运动的领导普遍出现了前紧后松现象。省府整风委员会十月四日开会传达讨论九月二十八日整风总会扩大会的意见，布置下一阶段工作时，分会十七个委员只到了四个委员，工业厅、民政厅、银行、劳动局主要负责干部都没有参加，只派了代表出席。山东省文联主任参加总会扩大会后，根据大家意见匆匆作了一个部门工作检查总结报告，以后竟丢开了本单位的整风领导，带着几个干部去北京度国庆节假日去了，直到七日始返回，使整风失去领导。省府卫生厅厅长在作了综合报告以后，没有参加与领导整风，致该厅整风陷于停顿。财政厅领导检查结束后，厅的领导干部思想上就松懈下来了，致使税务局领导干部没作综合报告，即先让下面同志提意见，然后把大家的意见印一下发下去，就算检查了局的领导；经费管理处处长综合报告没有自我批评，尽是批评一般干部不对。以上问题发生后，该厅王副厅长才开始注意帮助纠正。为什么会产生这种严重的情况呢！基本的原因是思想上对整风的认识不够，不是如毛主席在三中全会报告中所指示的“用阅读若干指定文件，总结工作，分析情况，展开批评和自我批评等方法，提高干部和一般党员的思想水平和政治水平”，而认为是“过关”，以致流于一般化的形式主义。其表现是：第一，多数部门领导干部在部门检查告一段落后，在思想上松了一口气，放松了领导，没有把首长负责，亲自动手这一原则贯彻到整个整风过程中去。第二，对中层干部缺乏进一步的动员和教育，中层干部未能在检查总结工作中起到应有的骨干作用。第三，没有根据运动逐步深入发展，进行继续不断的思想动员；在检查总结工作中普遍没有结合学习一定的文件，因而产生没有标准和无从着手现象。第四，从领导干部到一般干部普遍缺乏自我批评精神，思想斗争不能很好展开，检查工作不能和个人的思想作风有机地联系起来。
    省整风总会在研究以上情况时认为：这是当前整风运动的一个严重情况，如不很好解决，整个整风运动有落空的危险。为了转变以上情况，整风总会确定加强对省直机关三个整风分会的领导。要求各分会、各支会具体检查、分析所属单位目前整风运动深入不下去的具体原因，找出基本关键，作出具体可行的改进办法，切实有效的改变目前整风运动的严重情况。
