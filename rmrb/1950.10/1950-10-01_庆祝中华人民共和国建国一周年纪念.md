　　Celebrating the First Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China
　　Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, Chen Qiyou
　　The glorious and sacred October 1st has arrived for its first anniversary today. I believe that every Chinese person will greet this great festival with twelve times the excitement and joy. Every city and village, large and small, across the country is celebrating it wildly. I would like to express my thoughts on this day of national celebration! The birth of the People's Republic of China, although only a short year ago, has achieved successes unprecedented in Chinese history.

　　Firstly, and most fundamentally, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has liberated all mainland territory except Tibet and Taiwan, and several islands, leaving the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to only linger in Taiwan with the full support of American imperialism.

　　Secondly, the Chinese people, under the leadership of their leader Chairman Mao, have signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance with the great fraternal nation of the Soviet Union, truly uniting the people of the two great powers, about 800 million in total, becoming the main pillar of world peace and human happiness, and making the construction of the new China even more hopeful!

　　Thirdly, following the success of stabilizing prices in March this year, the Central People's Government has achieved an initial improvement in the national financial economy and laid the foundation for striving for a basic improvement in the financial economy, which has greatly surprised the whole world, whether friend or foe.

　　Fourthly, the land reform work, a prerequisite for building a new China, is being accelerated under the guidance of the Central People's Government. In the near future, there will be tens of millions more farmers who can cultivate and harvest on their own land, and land reform can be completed nationwide within two or three years.

　　Fifthly, in industrial construction, thanks to the support and cooperation of the broad masses of workers and peasants and all revolutionary classes across the country, we are gradually advancing (such as in the Northeast) and gradually recovering (such as inside the customs), so that the industry of the new China is gradually dawning.

　　Sixthly, we have also made many significant achievements in culture and education. From the most basic primary school education to advanced research work, we are moving forward in the direction of linking with practical needs.

　　All of this is just to mention a few of the main points; the various successes, both large and small, are too numerous to list!

　　All of these successes are not accidental, but are achieved under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. We do not know how to express our gratitude.

　　In this year's National Day, we have another great joy, which is that we have representatives of combat heroes and labor models of workers, peasants and soldiers from all over the country participating in the celebration, as well as representatives of all fraternal ethnic groups across the country. This not only demonstrates the unprecedented great unity of all ethnic groups across the country, but also shows that the creation of the new China is absolutely guaranteed. What is there for us not to rejoice over?

　　Naturally, imperialism, especially American imperialism, cannot bear to see the great victory of our Chinese people, and will inevitably use various methods to invade and interfere with our country and the various countries of the New Democracy, making the crisis of world war increasingly tense. Recently, the American imperialists' invasion of Korea, invasion of our Taiwan, and successive air raids on our territory are all conspiracies and tricks by war mongers to try to bring about the early outbreak of world war. This is what we must not forget today.

　　However, the Chinese people have been tempered in more than a hundred years of opposition to all evil imperialism. We have the great Communist Party and the wise leader Chairman Mao leading this young republic forward. What else can we worry about? We are absolutely not afraid of any imperialists intimidating us, nor are we afraid of them using any conspiracies to attack us. We must use all our strength to oppose war and defend peace. Let all imperialists tremble before us! We shout:

　　Long live the People's Republic of China!

　　Long live the great unity of the people of the world for lasting peace!

　　Long live Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the organizers of the victory of the Chinese people!

　　庆祝中华人民共和国建国一周年纪念
    中国致公党主席  陈其尤
    光荣神圣的十月一日今天已是一周年了，我相信每一个中国人民都将以十二万分兴奋与欢欣的心情来迎接这一个伟大的节日，全国各大小城市以及乡村没有一个地方不在狂欢地庆祝它。我愿意在这举国同庆的日子，说出我的感想！中华人民共和国的诞生，虽然还只有短短的一年，然而它的成就却是中国历史上从来所未有的。
    首先、而且最基本的是中国人民解放军已经解放了除西藏台湾以外全部大陆国土和若干岛屿，使蒋介石匪帮只能躲在台湾完全在美帝的支持之下苟延残喘。
    其次、是中国人民已经在自己的领袖毛主席的领导之下，和伟大的兄弟之邦苏联，签订了中苏友好同盟互助条约，将中苏两大国八万万左右的人民真正团结在一起，成为世界和平，人类幸福的主要支柱，同时使新中国的建设更有希望！
    第三、是中央人民政府继今年三月间稳定物价的成功之后，获得了整个国家财政经济的初步好转，并为争取财政经济的基本好转奠定了基础，使全世界无论敌友，均感到极大的惊异。
    第四、是建设新中国的先决条件的土改工作，在中央人民政府的指导之下，已经加速地在推动，在不久的将来，就会又有若干数以千万计的农民，都能在自己所有的土地上耕种收获，而在两三年内就可以在全国范围内完成土改了。
    第五、是在工业建设上，由于有了广大工农群众及全国各革命阶级的支持与合作，已经逐步在迈进（如东北）和逐步在恢复（如关内），使新中国的工业已渐露曙光。
    第六、是在文化教育上，我们也已经有了许多不小的建树。从最基层的小学教育直到高级的研究工作，都在向着与实际需要联系的方针前进。
    所有这一切，不过只举其主要的几点，其他比较小的各种各样的成功真是不胜枚举！
    所有这一切成功都不是偶然的，而是由于在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导之下才获得的。我们不知应当怎样才能表示出我们的感谢。
    在今年的国庆，我们还有一件很大的喜事，就是我们有全国各地来参加庆典的战斗英雄和工农兵劳动模范的代表，更有全国各兄弟民族的代表。这不仅表现了全国各民族的空前伟大团结，也说明了新中国的创造是绝对有把握的，我们还有什么不欢忻若狂呢？
    自然，帝国主义尤其是美国帝国主义，看不得我们中国人民的伟大胜利，必要以种种方法来侵略与干涉我国和新民主主义的各个国家，而使世界大战的危机日趋紧张，最近美国帝国主义者侵略朝鲜，侵略我国台湾，以及接二连三的空袭我国领土，都是战争贩子们企图使世界大战早日爆发的阴谋鬼计。这是我们在今天不可忘记的。
    然而，中国人民是从一百余年反对万恶帝国主义中锻炼出来的，我们有伟大的共产党和英明的领袖毛主席领导这年青的共和国前进，我们还有什么可以担心的地方呢？我们绝对不怕任何帝国主义者来威吓我们，也不怕它以任何阴谋来打击我们。我们要以我们的一切力量来反对战争，保卫和平。让一切帝国主义者在我们面前发抖吧！我们高呼：
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    全世界人民大团结促进持久和平万岁！
    中国人民胜利的组织者——毛主席和中国共产党万岁！
