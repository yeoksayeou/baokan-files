The People's Liberation Army is also a Production Force
--On the Representatives of Labor Models of the People's Liberation Army
    The great People's Liberation Army is not only a national defense force, but also a strong production force. It is not only responsible for defending the security of the motherland, but is also working with the people of the whole country to build a peaceful, happy, and beautiful new country. In the past year, the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, like on the battlefield, have actively participated in the country's economic construction with selfless labor and heroic and tenacious spirit in agricultural production, industrial production, railway and highway construction, and dike construction and canal irrigation water conservancy projects, and have achieved excellent results. The many troop representatives elected to attend the National Labor Model Representative Conference are the most vivid illustration.
    The People's Liberation Army has rich experience in agricultural production. As early as the most difficult period of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, the 359th Brigade stationed in northern Shaanxi implemented the policy of land reclamation in Nanniwan, turning barren mountains into fertile fields. Comrade Jiang Weiping, 73 years old this year, was a labor hero who ran a model farm at that time. He has maintained this glorious tradition and was again selected as a troop representative to attend this Labor Model Conference. Liu Xingzhen, a newly emerging agricultural labor model, is a soldier of the Third Field Army. Their troops were engaged in production in the early spring wind and snow. His hands cracked with many small openings, but he insisted on continuing to work, achieving excellent results of reclaiming an average of more than two mu of wasteland per day. Zhang Benliang is the deputy company commander of a certain unit of the North China Military Region. When the troops were developing a new-style farm in Lutai, he was able to organize and lead, study technology, and promote democracy in production, which enabled the troops to greatly exceed the production tasks. Li Yanxi, the squad leader of a certain unit of the 22nd Corps of the Xinjiang Uprising Force, and their troops were transformed and tempered in their labor and production. They reclaimed land on the cold northwest plateau. On the land sealed by cold ice, he attacked one mu and six fen a day, more than twice as much as others, and led the entire squad to become a model, winning the red flag many times.
    Although the People's Liberation Army is not familiar with industrial production, the commanders and fighters are determined to learn, not only learn, but also highly develop their wisdom to create. Gao Wende, a soldier of the Fourth Field Army, is a labor model in tungsten mining. Their troops signed a contract with Jiangxi Tungsten Mine Company to mine tungsten ore on a large scale on Mount Centipede, more than 1,000 meters above sea level. With a tenacious spirit of hard work and endurance, they overcame various difficulties, built barracks, accumulated food and grass, united workers, and learned technology. Finally, they turned a barren mountain into a mine for the motherland. He is an outstanding member of this production army. After humbly learning and exploring, he not only learned himself, but also taught other comrades how to look at tungsten anchors, hold chisels, hammer, drill holes, use explosives, smash sand, sieve sand... and other complete techniques, and also improved the mining methods, greatly improving productivity. There are many such examples in the troops engaged in mining.
    In the past year, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have participated in a large number of railway and highway construction projects. The Railway Corps has made indelible contributions to repairing national railways and supporting the Liberation War. For example, Yang Lian, the climbing hero who repaired Bridge No. 8 on the Longhai Road, tried to climb to the 45-meter-high pier, using only wooden boards to protect himself, and alternately used explosives to blow up the top of the pier, showing a selfless spirit of sacrifice. In the field army, labor models in road construction such as Wang Zhongyong, Zhang Zhenzhi, Du Xuegang, and Yao Zhenrui were also produced. Comrade Wang Zhongyong is a soldier of the First Field Army. Their troops built highways on the grasslands of a certain area in Qinghai. Sometimes they had to work on plateaus more than 4,700 meters above sea level, in harsh climates with snow, rain, and hail. He took the lead in labor and invented a semi-drainage ditch method to drain the spring water inside the roadbed and the rainwater that infiltrated the road surface, so that the roadbed remained dry, solid and durable, solving a huge difficulty in the project. Comrade Zhang Zhenzhi is a platoon leader of the Third Field Army. When erecting a large bridge, he humbly learned, learned to mark the direction in three days, learned to drive piles in a week, and he could direct the troops to work without the supervisor, and created a method of throwing seven-character anchors to drive piles with wooden rafts, saving 7,200 workers and increasing work efficiency by more than one time. Du Xuegang, a soldier of the Northeast Military Region, created a new record of digging 26 cubic meters of earth per day in highway construction, and promoted the completion of the entire regiment one month ahead of schedule. Yao Zhenrui, the squad leader of the Second Field Army, led the entire squad to work nervously on the forefront of the cliff when rushing to repair a certain highway bridge. A piece of flesh was smashed from his right leg by a stone, and blood flowed straight down. He still gritted his teeth and insisted on working. They completed the 18-day project in 10 days.
    The People's Liberation Army has also achieved brilliant results in water conservancy projects to conquer nature. Labor models such as Tan Guojin, Kurbanov, and Sun Longjiao have emerged. Comrade Tan Guojin is a propaganda officer of a certain army of the Fourth Field Army. He averaged 7.16 cubic meters of earth per day, and had to walk about 60 kilometers back and forth, creating the highest record of dike construction in the entire army, and won the first place as a dike construction model in the entire army. Kurbanov is a soldier of the 5th Army of the Xinjiang National Army. He can excavate a canal 8 meters long, 5 meters wide, and 45 centimeters deep every day. On the hard land sealed by water, he can dig 26.7 cubic meters of earth every day, and won the first place among the 27 famous labor models in the entire army. Sun Longjiao, the squad leader of the East China Military Region, raised soil to repair the embankment during the Yellow River autumn flood last year. He and his troops carried soil to repair the embankment during the day, and patrolled the embankment with lanterns at night. Once, he suddenly discovered a hole under the river embankment, and the water was rushing bigger and bigger. In a critical situation, he jumped into the water regardless of everything, blocked the hole with his semi-disabled body, and saved hundreds of thousands of people from disaster.
    According to incomplete statistics as of July, the troops planted a total of about 3,157,000 mu of land this year; in the Northwest region, 22 canals were repaired, 710 kilometers of the western section of the Longhai Road were contracted for repair, and 386 kilometers of highways were completed; in the Southwest region, 25 weirs and dikes were built and repaired, and they participated in the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project; in the East China region, a total of 114,000 man-days were spent on dike and railway repairs. In the Central South region, three large rivers were dug, eight dikes were built, and more than 430,000 man-days were spent on railway and highway construction. In the North China region, they participated in the water conservancy projects of more than 20 rivers; the troops of the Northeast Military Region participated in various projects and sideline production, and it is estimated that the total wages and dividends for the whole year can reach 15.7 billion yuan in RMB.

　　人民解放军又是一支生产大军
    ——记人民解放军劳动模范代表们
    伟大的人民解放军，不仅是一支国防军，同时又是一支强有力的生产大军。他不但负责捍卫祖国的安全，同时正与全国人民一道，建设一个和平幸福美好的新国家。一年以来，人民解放军指战员们像在战场上一样，以忘我的劳动和英勇顽强的精神，在农业生产中、在工业生产中、在修筑铁道公路中、在修堤开渠水利工程中，积极地参加了国家的经济建设工作，获得了优异的成绩。这次当选出席全国劳模代表会议的许多部队代表，就是最生动的说明。
    人民解放军有着从事农业生产的丰富经验。还在抗日战争最艰苦的时期，当时驻在陕北的三五九旅就在南泥湾执行了屯垦政策，把荒山开辟成良田。今年七十三岁的蒋维平同志，就是当时经营模范农场的劳动英雄，他一直保持了这光荣传统，又被选为出席这次劳模会议的部队代表。新涌现的农业劳模刘行珍是三野的战士，他们的部队在初春的风雪中从事生产，他的手裂开了许多小口，仍坚持继续劳动，获得每天平均开荒二亩多的优异成绩。张本良是华北军区某部的副连长，当部队在芦台开辟新式农场时，因他善于组织领导、钻研技术、在生产中发扬民主，使部队大大超过生产任务。新疆起义部队二十二兵团某部的班长李彦西，他们的部队在从事劳动生产中，得到了改造和锻炼。他们在寒冷的西北高原上开垦，在被寒冰封结着的土地上，他一天突击到一亩六分，超过别人一倍以上，并领导全班成为模范，屡次夺得红旗。
    对于工业生产，人民解放军虽不熟悉，但指战员们肯决心学习，不但学会，而且高度发挥了智慧去创造。四野战士高文德，就是开采钨矿中的劳动模范。他们的部队与江西钨矿公司订立合同，在拔海一千余公尺的蜈蚣山上，大规模开采钨矿，他们以顽强的吃苦耐劳的精神，克服种种困难，盖营房、积粮草、团结工人、学习技术，终于将一片荒山变成祖国的矿场。他就是这支生产军中杰出的一个。他经过虚心学习和摸索研究，不仅自己学会，而且还教会其他同志如何看钨锚，掌钎、打锤、钻眼、使炸药、砸砂子、筛砂子……等全套技术，并且还改进了开采方法，使生产力大大提高。像他这样的例子，在从事采矿的部队中就不少。
    解放军的战士们在一年中大量的参加了铁路、公路的修筑工程。铁道兵团在抢修全国铁道、支援解放战争中，有其不可磨灭的功绩。例如抢修陇海路上八号桥的登高英雄杨连弟，他设法攀高到四十五米高的桥墩上，仅用木板掩护自己，轮番用炸药炸破墩顶，表现了忘我的牺牲精神。野战部队中，也产生了像王仲勇、张振智、杜学刚、姚祯瑞等筑路中的劳动模范。王仲勇同志是一野的战士，他们部队在青海某地区的草原上兴修公路，有时须在拔海四千七百多公尺的高原上，在有时雪雨有时冰雹的恶劣气候下劳动。他在劳动中起了带头作用，并发明了半排水沟的方法，排出路基内部的泉水和路面浸入的雨水，使路基保持干燥巩固持久，解决了工程上一个巨大的困难。张振智同志是三野的排长，在架设某座大桥时，他虚心学习，三天学会标定方向，一星期学会打桩，监工不来，他也可以指挥部队作业，并且创造了抛七字锚使木排打桩的方法，省工七千二百人，提高工作效率一倍以上。东北军区战士杜学刚，在修筑公路中，创造了每天挖土二十六立方米的新纪录，并推动全团提前一月完工。二野的姚祯瑞班长，在抢修某公路桥梁时，领导全班在悬崖的最前沿紧张工作，右腿被石头砸了一块肉，鲜血直流，仍咬牙坚持工作，他们十天突击完成了十八天的工程。
    人民解放军在征服自然的水利工程中，也得到了辉煌的成绩。出现了像檀国金、库尔巴诺夫、孙龙蛟等劳动模范。檀国金同志是四野某军的宣传人员，他每天挑土平均七·一六土方，来回要走约六十公里，创造了全军筑堤的最高纪录，荣获全军第一名筑堤模范。库尔巴诺夫是新疆民族军第五军的战士，他每天能开掘长八公尺宽五公尺深四十五公分的水渠，在被水封的坚硬土地上，每天能挖二六·七立方公尺的土，荣获全军出名的二十七个劳模中的第一名。华东军区孙龙蛟班长，在去年黄河秋汛抢险时，他和部队白天抬土修堤，晚上提灯沿堤巡查，有一次，他突然发现河堤底下有漏洞，水势愈冲愈大，十分危急，他不顾一切跳下水去，以半残废的身子堵住洞口，使数十万人民免于灾难。
    截至七月止据不完全的统计，今年部队种地共约三百一十五万七千余亩；在西北区修渠二十二条，包修陇海路西段七一○公里，完成公路三八六公里；在西南区筑堰修堤二十五条，并参加修筑成渝铁路工程；在华东区修堤修铁路共一十一万四千余工。在中南区挖大河三条、筑堤八条，参加铁路公路修筑等共四十三万余工。在华北区参加了二十余条河流之水利工程；东北军区部队参加各种工程及副业生产，估计全年可获工资和红利合人民币一百五十七亿元。
