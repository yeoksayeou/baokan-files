　　My Thoughts
    Zhu Fusheng
    A year has passed since I participated in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the founding ceremony of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. On this great festival, I express my feelings as follows:
    In this year, the Central People's Government was established, leading the national construction, and making great contributions to the people. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the People's Liberation Army liberated all of China, basically eliminated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and basically liberated mainland China. As Chairman Mao said at the CPPCC, the Chinese people, who account for a quarter of the world's population, have stood up today. The people of the whole country are united and manage their own affairs. Economically, Chairman Mao delivered a report on striving for a fundamental improvement in the national financial and economic situation. The national finance has been unified and led, the fiscal revenue and expenditure have been balanced, the price increases have been stopped, the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas has been carried out, the state has transferred grain, purchased local products, and victoriously overcome the serious disasters. This is the great contribution of the Central People's Government in the past year.
    Seeing the beautiful scenery of China today, I cannot help but recall the darkness of the old society. Before liberation, in the old society, I suffered heavy and cruel exploitation and lived a dark and painful life. I labored as an adult but could not even get warm clothes. From day to night, from spring to autumn, I was busy all day long. But I was short of food for half a year every year, eating bran and wild vegetables every day, and worried about food and clothing every day. In the spring, I couldn't afford to eat. I begged the landlord for a loan with a 40% interest rate. If I didn't pay it back when it was due, the interest would be compounded. In 1928, I had no food to eat and borrowed ten yuan from the landlord. In one year and three months, the principal and interest became twenty yuan. I rented twenty mu of land from the landlord, and I only got 30% of the grain I harvested each year. The landlord looked down on the poor like dogs. The landlord sent me to deliver a wedding gift, saying that I couldn't take a break. Immediately, the landlord got angry and wanted to uncover the pot, lock the door, and drive me out. In the end, I apologized and kowtowed to settle the matter. Thinking back carefully, I herded cattle, worked, and was a tenant farmer since I was a child. I suffered poverty and hardship, and I didn't have a good day for more than 30 years.
    In 1939, the Communist Party came and implemented reasonable burdens, rent reduction and interest reduction, land reform, democratic movement, production for disaster relief and famine preparedness; loans for grain, relief for the poor, abolition of feudal exploitation, and the establishment of the people's power. Since then, I have turned over politically, economically, and culturally. Economically, I got houses and land when I had no house or land. Culturally, I learned more than a thousand new characters from being illiterate. Politically, I didn't know what the country was in the past, but under the leadership of the Communist Party, I served as the head of the militia regiment and the militia instructor in supporting the front lines, and served as the village chief and district chief in the rear government. Everyone elected me as the county chief. In this way, I also completely turned over politically. Where did these liberation come from? This is the result of the great people's leader Chairman Mao leading the Communist Party of China and the Chinese People's Liberation Army bravely fighting, not afraid of sacrifice and bloodshed, defeating the Kuomintang reactionaries, and liberating all of the mainland.
    Chairman Mao said that this year's harvest is better than last year's. The summer harvest seems to be generally good. If the autumn harvest is also good, next year will be better than this year. The summer harvest, autumn harvest, and late autumn harvest in 1950 were much better than last year. The mountainous areas, plains, and hilly areas, except for a small part of the land that was flooded and died due to long-term water storage, all had bumper harvests. The average grain yield per mu generally exceeded 150 jin, with a maximum of 300 jin per mu and a minimum of 150 jin. This is the first great harvest in more than ten years.
    In order to respond to Chairman Mao's call and do a good job in fundamentally improving the financial and economic situation, we must first do a good job in land reform. I am determined to unite with the broad masses of people and strive for the fundamental improvement of the financial and economic situation, first and foremost for the implementation of land reform!
    Comrade Zhu Fusheng is the county chief of Yishui County, Shandong. He used to herd cattle, work, beg for food, and tenant the landlord's land since he was a child. After liberation in 1939 (Comrade Zhu Fusheng was 32 years old at the time), he served as village chief, militia instructor, administrative village chief, district chief, and speaker of the Yinan County Council. In 1945, he was elected as a labor hero in the central and southern Shandong region. Later, he led the militia to support the Menglianggu, Jinan, and Huaihai campaigns. In 1949, he participated in the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as an alternate representative of the peasant organizations in the liberated areas. He is currently a representative of the Shandong Provincial People's Congress. In May of this year, he took over as the county chief of Yishui County. ——Editor

　　我的感想
    朱富胜
    自从去年我参加了中国人民政治协商会议，参加了中华人民共和国中央人民政府的成立典礼到今天已是一年了。在这个伟大的节日，我发表我的感言如下：
    在这一年来，中央人民政府成立，领导国家建设，对人民有了伟大的贡献。在毛主席、朱总司令领导下，人民解放军解放了全中国，基本消灭了蒋匪帮，中国大陆基本解放了。正如毛主席在政协会上说的，占人类总数四分之一人口的中国人民今天站起来了，全国人民团结起来了，自己办自己的事情了。在经济上毛主席发表了为争取国家财政经济状况基本好转而斗争的报告。在国家财政上统一管理，统一领导了，财政收支平衡了，制止物价上涨，开展城乡物资交流，国家调运粮食，收购土产品，并胜利地战胜了严重灾荒。这是中央人民政府成立一年来的伟大贡献。
    看到中国今日的美景，不禁使我想起了旧社会的黑暗。解放前，我在旧的社会里，受着重重的残酷剥削，过着黑暗的痛苦生活，成年劳动不得一暖。从白天到黑夜，从春天到秋天，每天劳劳碌碌。但却是一年缺半年吃，每天吃糠咽菜，没有一天不愁吃不愁穿的。到春天吃不上饭，冬天穿不上衣，每到春天无粮吃，托人求情向地主四分利借钱，到期不还，期上翻期，利上翻利。我一九二八年没饭吃，借了地主十元钱，一年零三个月连本带利就成了二十元。我佃种了地主二十亩地，每年收入粮食，自己只得到百分之三十。地主看穷人不如狗，地主派我去送亲，说了一个不得闲，马上地主生了气，就要揭锅、锁门、赶出去，最后赔情赔罪、磕头才算了事。细细回忆一下，我从小放牛扛活当佃户，受穷受苦，三十多年没有好日子过。
    在一九三九年共产党来了，实行合理负担，减租减息，土地改革，民主运动，生产救灾备荒；贷款贷粮，救济贫民，取消了封建剥削，建立了人民的政权。从此我才在政治上、经济上、文化上翻了身。在经济上从没房没地分到了房子和土地。在文化上从不识字，学习了一千多个生字。在政治上过去不知国家是什么，但在共产党领导下我从支援前线中就当民工团长及民兵指导员，在后方政权担任村长、区长，大家又选我当县长。这样，我在政治上也彻底翻了身。这些翻身解放是那里来的？这是伟大的人民领袖毛主席领导的中国共产党和中国人民解放军英勇善战，不怕牺牲流血，打垮了国民党反动派，解放了全部大陆的结果。
    毛主席说，今年年成比去年好，夏收看来一般是好的，如果秋收也是好的，明年光景会比今年好些。一九五○年夏收、秋收、晚秋都比去年好的多，山区平原丘陵地，除长年存水地涝死少部分外，全部丰收，一般中中亩平均粮食超过一百五十斤的产量，最高每中中亩三百斤，最低一百五十斤。这是十几年第一次的大丰收。
    为了响应毛主席的号召，作好使财政经济基本好转的工作，我们就首先要作好土改工作。我决心和广大人民团结在一起，为争取财政经济的基本好转首先是为实行土地改革而奋斗！
    朱富胜同志是山东沂水县县长。他从小曾放牛、做活、要饭、佃种地主土地。一九三九年（朱富胜同志当时是三十二岁）解放后，即担任村长、民兵指导员、行政村村长、区长、沂南县参议长等工作。一九四五年曾被选为鲁中南区劳动英雄。其后又领导民兵支援孟良崮、济南、淮海等战役。一九四九年，以各解放区农民团体候补代表资格参加中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议。现为山东省人民代表会议代表。今年五月，担任了沂水县县长的工作。  ——编者
