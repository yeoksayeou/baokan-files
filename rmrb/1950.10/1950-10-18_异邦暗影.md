　　“Alien Shadow”
    By K. Simonov, printed by Dazhong Bookstore
    Translated by Sofia, First Edition, August 1950
    "The Soviet people are happy to read works that show the entire rich and multifaceted life of Soviet society, works that truthfully and vividly reflect the struggle and labor of the Soviet people, their spiritual world and high moral qualities. The Soviet people are happy to see works that call for progress, clearly show new things in life, show the struggle between the old and the new, and are happy to see works that reflect reality in development." The Soviet News reported this way about the literature beloved by the Soviet people and pointed out the direction of Soviet literature development. Simonov's recent work profoundly shows the brilliant struggle between the old and the new, with extremely high skill and extremely rich ideological and artistic content.
    The protagonist of the book, Trubnikov, the director of the Soviet Institute of Bacteriology, is portrayed as an intellectual figure who still has remnants of the old history. He is a very accomplished vaccine researcher, but precisely because of this, like scholars who generally hold simple technical viewpoints, he fell into the trap of unprincipled so-called academic "internationalism." When his vaccine research, which had taken him more than twenty years, was about to succeed, he prepared to hand over some of the preliminary data to an American "medical delegation" in Moscow through another academic worker, Okunev (a hidden spy). He did this because: "I want my reputation to be even higher than it is now. I am talking about academic reputation. In the end, this reputation comes from here, comes from there—it doesn't matter where it comes from." He was not satisfied with his reputation in his Soviet motherland, he also wanted his reputation to come from the United States!
    Obviously, he forgot the fact that "there are two worlds and two systems on the earth," and forgot the fact that the imperialist countries are the mortal enemies of the socialist countries and the mortal enemies of the people of the world. Let us think about it: he not only made the serious mistake of replacing the interests of the people with personal interests ("reputation"); but also easily gave the vaccine achievement, which can benefit the people and govern the world in the hands of the socialist country, but will definitely be used for military adventures in the hands of the imperialist country, to others. As Trubnikov's brother-in-law, Makeyev, told him: "What you have done—is not an acute illness, not recklessness, nor stupidity. What you have done, and what I hope you haven't had time to finish, is the crime of treason!"
    This is a concrete and serious lesson for scientists or other intellectuals who only think about "technology" and "reputation" all the time and do not understand the significance of their achievements from a political point of view. This also raises the fact that when an accomplished scientist is politically paralyzed, he runs the risk of unknowingly falling into the trap of imperialist academic spies.
    What made Trubnikov politically paralyzed? His sister gave him a sharp criticism: "You are lagging behind yourself." — "You yourself are lagging behind you as a scholar." What led Trubnikov to that path of ignorance and crime was his backward historical remnants. Although he had joined the Party for five years, he still had strong individualism, "I am above everything," emphasizing "my own technology," overestimating "scientific rights," and pursuing "world reputation." He also harbored vulgar humanitarian ideas, imagining "standing aside and loving everyone," and could not distinguish between good and evil, and thoroughly realize that "humanitarianism is: struggle; struggle for the future of mankind, science, and culture, struggle against darkness." Worse, he not only did not understand that "this darkness is slowly crawling from the other half of the earth," but also had the illusion floating in his consciousness that "that world that hates us is much nobler than it actually is," which bred a terrible idea of ​​flattering foreigners. It was these thoughts that were haunting him, causing him to forget the cultivation of the Party, the support of the country, and the help of the people, and stubbornly committed the crime of treason.
    In contrast to Trubnikov, the young generation of the Soviet Union—these are the Soviet people made of "special materials" as Stalin said—showed a completely new style and qualities: the young Party branch secretary not only personally underwent rat vaccine experiments first, but also cared about the research work while being tested, demonstrating the Bolshevik's selfless and highly dedicated spirit. When Trubnikov's mistakes were discovered, and the more discussions and investigations, the more serious they became, his sister, his brother-in-law, his daughter, and his assistant who had never violated him once in twenty-six years, all seriously and ruthlessly opposed him and urged him. It was because he was "not serving the people" but "working for foreign countries"; it was because "struggling against the habits passed down from the old things"; it was because not letting the enemy find a terrible weapon of murder from the Soviet people "in the process of finding immunity for mankind." They also have a concept of honor, but their concept of honor is: "Not how we individuals can become famous figures, but how our motherland can become famous because of us."
    The impression given to us by the new force is so strong:—His brother-in-law, Makeyev, originally flew to his lover's side for a vacation with great excitement, but when he learned about this serious incident, he forced Trubnikov to write a note, set off that night and flew to Moscow the next morning, and took back Trubnikov's so-called "first book of his own technology." Precisely because of his serious spirit of being responsible to the people, even though imperialism and its dog, Okunev, used the trick of stealing the sky and changing the sun—returning the original manuscript, but leaving a copy, he cleverly discovered this trick, and before the copy could be sent to the imperialists, Okunev had to commit suicide in front of the people who arrested him.
    In the play, a series of vivid fighting scenes are profoundly exposed. Simonov in the book, as Zhdanov said in his review of Soviet literature: "Select the good qualities and emotions of the Soviet people, look forward to their tomorrow, and at the same time... strike at the remnants of yesterday that are hindering the Soviet people from moving forward." Okunev walked into the trap himself, which was a crime worthy of death; but although Trubnikov made a mistake, "the government still believes in his loyalty and does not doubt his ability to atone for his sins." He finally shouted: "Let's go to the laboratory!" The play also came to an end. This is also a good quality and emotion of the Soviet people, which is what we usually say: "Learn from the past to avoid future mistakes, and treat the illness to save the patient," which is the basic spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and is the driving force for promoting socialist society towards tomorrow.
    We can learn infinite lessons from this book. In addition to the above, this play strongly warns us: When imperialism still exists, it will always try its best to extend its claws to socialist countries (or new democratic countries) to steal its things, or to destroy it, and will always try its best to be an enemy of the people's new world. Sometimes this conspiracy is not obvious, but it is indeed a terrible "shadow," and this "shadow" takes people's backward thinking as a breeding ground. This is exactly what the people of our new China should be highly vigilant about.
    This is a good book worth recommending, an outstanding play, sharp and full of extremely realistic educational significance. This book is especially suitable for intellectuals to read. It is like a mirror, which can reflect many things; it is also like a sieve, which will inevitably wash away many dregs of backward thinking.

### “异邦暗影”

　　“异邦暗影”
    Ｋ·西蒙诺夫著  大众书店印行
    苏菲亚译  一九五○年八月初版
    “苏联人民高兴阅读显示苏维埃社会整个丰富的和多方面生活的作品，这种作品真实而鲜明地反映苏维埃人们的斗争和劳动，他们的精神世界和高度的道德品质。苏联人民高兴看号召前进、清楚地显示生活里的新东西、显示新旧进行斗争的作品，高兴看反映在发展中的现实的作品。”苏联消息报曾这样反映了苏联人民所爱好的文学，并指出了苏联文学发展的方向。西蒙诺夫这本近著正是深刻地显示了新旧进行斗争的光辉的作品，有着极高度的技巧，与极丰富的思想和艺术的内容。
    作为还有着旧的历史残余的知识分子形象的，是书中的主人翁——苏联细菌学研究院院长特鲁布尼柯夫。他是一位很有成就的疫苗研究者，但正因为这样，他像一般抱有单纯技术观点的学者一样，流入无原则的所谓学术“国际性”的陷阱里去。当他花了二十几年的疫苗研究快要成功的时候，却把一部分预备资料通过另一个学术工作者奥库涅夫（一个隐藏的间谍）准备交给一个在莫斯科的美国“医学代表团”。他这样做，为的是：“我愿意声望比现在所有的再高一些。我所说的是学术上的名誉。归根结底，这个名气从这里来从那里来，——从哪里来都是一样。”他对于自己在苏联祖国的名望不满足，他还想他的声望从美国那里来呢！
    显然的，他忘记了“地球上有两个世界、两种制度存在”这一个事实，忘记了帝国主义国家是社会主义国家死对头、是世界人民死对头这一个事实。让我们想想看吧：他不但犯了以个人利益（“声望”）去代替人民利益这一个严重的错误；而且轻易地把一个在社会主义国家手里可以益人治世，而在帝国主义国家手里定会供作军事冒险的疫苗成就送给人家。正如特鲁布尼柯夫的妹夫马凯也夫所告诉他的一样：“你所做的事，——不是急性病，不是轻率，也不是愚蠢。你所做的事，以及我希望你还没来得及做完的事，是叛国的罪行！”
    这对于时时刻刻只想到“技术”“声望”而不从政治去了解他自己成就的意义的科学家或其他知识分子，是一个具体的严重的教训。这也举出了一个事实，当一个有成就的科学家在政治上麻痹的时候，他就有不知不觉的落入帝国主义学术间谍的圈套中去的危险。
    什么东西使得特鲁布尼柯夫在政治上麻痹起来的呢？他的妹妹给了他一针见血的批评：“你自己落后于自己。”——“你本人落后于学者的你。”使特鲁布尼柯夫走上那种无知与犯罪道路的，是他的那些落后的历史残余。他虽然入党五年，但还有着浓烈的个人主义，“我高于一切”，强调“自己技术”，高估“科学权利”，追求“世界名望”。他又怀着庸俗的人道主义的观念，想象“站在一旁爱一切的人”，而不能区别善与恶，彻底认识到“人道主义就是：斗争；为人类、科学、文化的未来而斗争，为反对黑暗而斗争。”更坏的是，他不但不明了“这个黑暗是从地球的另一半慢慢地爬近来的”，而且意识里还飘浮着那样的幻想，以为“那个仇视我们的世界，比它实际的情形要高尚许多”，这就滋生了一种可怕的媚外思想。是这些思想在他心里作祟，使他忘记了党的栽培、国家的扶植和人民对他的帮助，一意孤行地犯了叛国的罪行。
    和特鲁布尼柯夫相反，苏联年青的一代，——这些就是斯大林所说的以“特殊材料做成的”苏维埃人——就表现了全新的作风和品质：年青的党支部书记，不但首先亲身受鼠疫苗试验，而且在被试验中还关心着研究的工作，表现了布尔什维克忘我的高度的献身精神。当特鲁布尼柯夫的错误被发现，而且愈讨论愈追究，愈显得严重的时候，他的妹妹、他的妹夫、他的女儿、他的二十六年来从未违反过他一次的助手，一律严重地、无情地反对他，督促他。为的是他已“不为人民服务”，而是“为外国努力”；为的是“同那由旧的老的东西传下来的习气作斗争”；为的是不让敌人从苏联人“在为人类寻找免疫法的过程中，找到了可怕的杀人武器”。他们也有名誉观念，但他们的名誉观念是：“不在于我们个人怎样可以成为有名的人物，而是我们的祖国怎样可以因为我们而出名。”
    新的力量给予我们的印象是这么强烈：——他的妹夫马凯也夫原是兴冲冲地飞到爱人身边度假期的，可是当他知道了这件严重的事件以后，他就逼着特鲁布尼柯夫写了字条，当晚起程次晨飞到莫斯科，把特鲁布尼柯夫所谓的“自己技术的第一本书”取回。正因为他这种对人民负责的认真精神，所以尽管帝国主义和它的走狗奥库涅夫使用偷天换日的诡计，——以原稿交还，却另外留下来一份副本，但他很机敏地发现了这个诡计，在副本未能送到帝国主义者手里以前，奥库涅夫只好在逮捕他的人们面前自杀了。
    在剧本里，极深刻地暴露了一系列的生动的斗争场面。西蒙诺夫在书中，如日丹诺夫在评论苏联文学时曾说过的：“挑选苏联人好的品质和情感，展望他们前面的明天，同时……打击那些阻碍苏联人前进的昨天的残余。”奥库涅夫自蹈罗网，那是罪该万死的；但特鲁布尼柯夫虽犯了错误，“政府仍然相信他的忠诚，也不怀疑他有能力赎罪”。他最后嚷着：“我们到试验室里去吧！”剧本也跟着告了终场。这也正是苏联人好的品质和情感的一面，正是我们通常所说：“惩前毖后，治病救人”的一面，是批评与自我批评的基本精神，是推动社会主义社会走向明天的动力。
    我们从本书中可以领略到无穷的教训，除了上述的以外，这一个剧本强烈地警惕着我们：当帝国主义还存着的时候，它总要想尽方法，向社会主义国家（或新民主主义国家）伸出它的魔爪偷她的东西，或者是破坏她，总要想尽方法，和人民的新世界为敌。有时这种阴谋不是显而易见的，但确是一个可怕的“暗影”，而这“暗影”是以人们的落后思想做温床的。这也正是我们新中国人民应该高度警觉的。
    这是一本值得推荐的好书，一个杰出的剧本，尖锐而富有极现实的教育意义。这本书特别适应于知识分子阅读。它如一面镜子一样，可以照见许多东西；也如同一个筛子一样，必然会清洗掉许多落后思想的渣滓。
