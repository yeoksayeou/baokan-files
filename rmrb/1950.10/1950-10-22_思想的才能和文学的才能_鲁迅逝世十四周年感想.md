　　The Talent of Thought and the Talent of Literature
    ——Thoughts on the Fourteenth Anniversary of Lu Xun's Death
    Xue Feng

    I.
    I don't remember which comrade said this orally: the poems of some poets now, filling a whole book, are not as good as Lu Xun's one or two thousand-word essay, whether in terms of thought or poetic feeling.
    Such words are correct as a criticism of some bad poems, and also correct as a view of Lu Xun's essays. Lu Xun's essays have more elements of thought and poetry than many of our poems.
    But I think this is by no means using Lu Xun to suppress people; nor is it that there is only one Lu Xun in mind, as if having one Lu Xun makes everything else invisible and everything can be obliterated. I think that is definitely not the meaning.
    This is just a reflection, illustrating that some of our poems have neither thought nor poetry.
    However, our poems, and other works as well, such as novels and plays, must have thought and must have poetry and art.
    Writers and poets must have political and ideological sensitivity, and must also have poetic and artistic sensitivity; they must have political and ideological talent, and must also have poetic and artistic talent.
    Lu Xun is someone we can and should learn from, because he was a genius in politics and thought, and also a genius in poetry and literature, especially a genius who unified and developed both talents.
    What we are still lacking and falling short of now is indeed these two unified talents.

    II.
    For example, we regard Lu Xun as a great people's writer and literary figure, but the biggest and most basic characteristic of Lu Xun as a great writer is that he was a revolutionary thinker, a great warrior of revolutionary enlightenment.
    All his poetic and literary characteristics arise from this, are built on top of this, and serve and are for the purpose of completing his thoughts. Therefore, his literary works are the poetry of thought, the poetry of politics, the poetry of powerful generalizations of life.
    And therefore, when Lu Xun is regarded as a thinker, how great is the role played by all his literary characteristics. His thoughts are set off in poetic wisdom and language like jewels. His novel and profound poetic sense and rich poetic emotions, and his literary characteristics that reflect the wisdom and cultural merits of the Chinese nation, enrich his thoughts, deepen his thoughts, and add infinite vitality and brilliance. The power of his art enables his thoughts to "travel without legs" in dissemination.
    Some say that because Lu Xun was a highly skilled literary figure, he instead obscured his status as a thinker. I don't think this statement is quite appropriate. Because Lu Xun's literary skill came from the fact that he was a thinker, his literary skill not only came from the strength of his thoughts, but also made the power of his thinker magnificent and elevated.
    Others say that Lu Xun's thoughts would be much better if he did not adopt literary expression methods, and that his literary skills hindered the systematization, clarity, and popularization of his thoughts. This issue is much more complex. First, there are originally scientific and literary methods of expressing thoughts. Scientific thoughts and scientific revolutionary theories are best and must adopt scientific expression methods. For example, Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao, they are great revolutionary scientific thinkers, and we also know that they all have the great genius of literary poetry. In order to ensure and develop the scientific nature of their thoughts, they of course adopt strict scientific organization and expression methods. We can even see that when these great men engaged in scientific treatises and felt that literary poetic methods could hinder scientificity, they tried their best to suppress their literary poetic genius and temperament. In this way, they exemplified their most scientific expression methods. But they also compressed their rich and profound poetic emotions into the foundation of their treatises; at the same time, they also adopted some literary expression methods when they did not hinder but helped, so not only their language is correct, concise, scientific and literary, but also literary epigrams, wit, humor, satire, and lyricism can be found everywhere. We all feel that the works of people like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao are particularly profound, because not only are their scientific thoughts profound, but their works also reflect their warm and profound emotions. They completely use scientific expression methods, but it does not prevent them from adopting some literary expression methods, which proves that these two methods are not in conflict.
    Speaking of learning, whether we are writers or poets, we should first learn from these great revolutionary teachers. For example, when learning about thought, not only should the method of thought be learned from these great men, but also the method of expression should be learned, because regardless of writers and poets, expressing thoughts must also be expressed correctly and in accordance with science. Moreover, in the works of these great men, we can also learn literature and literary expression methods. We should of course first read these teachers' works as revolutionary scientific classics, but if we also read them as classical literary works, we can also learn literature and at the same time get the benefits of quality cultivation.
    But their method of expressing thoughts is ultimately a scientific method of expression. Although these great men all have great literary and poetic genius, they are all unified in great thinkers.
    Lu Xun is a writer, a literary figure. His status as a thinker is unified in his status as a literary figure. His thoughts mainly adopt literary expression methods. Literature supplements what science lacks, because in addition to reflecting thoughts, literature also reflects and promotes people's emotions and aesthetic feelings. Literature takes people's thoughts as necessary, and also takes people's poetic emotions and beautiful feelings as necessary. Lu Xun reflected and promoted the people's thoughts, and also reflected and promoted the people's emotions. Perhaps he, as a literary figure, more or less hindered the development and completion of the scientific nature of his thoughts; but in Lu Xun, a writer and poet, he completed the task of reflecting and promoting the people's emotions, and also developed his thoughts with the characteristics of a poet and writer, and in some aspects of the task of reflecting and promoting the people's thoughts, he was unique, and he saw places that others did not pay attention to and could not see with the sensitive and sharp eyes of a poet. These are not only the characteristics of his literature, but also the characteristics of his thoughts.
    Therefore, what we learn from Lu Xun, who is a poet and also a thinker, is his literature and his thoughts. More correctly speaking now, we are learning his literary talent and his talent for thought, and how to unify and develop the experience of both talents equally.
    As for the literary expression methods of Lu Xun himself, there are also some shortcomings, such as his texts being somewhat obscure and circuitous, making some of his arguments not direct and clear enough, and therefore not easy for the general public to understand. This is mainly due to the limitations of the era, especially the past reactionary dark rule that oppressed him so much. Moreover, these shortcomings, which are generally not his own responsibility, are not major in Lu Xun. Furthermore, regarding the issue of systematization, I feel that Lu Xun's thoughts still form a system of their own, which must be viewed from the fact that his thoughts are unified in his literary expression. In short, these do not prevent us from learning, learning his unified genius of thought and literature.
    Whether it is a thinker-type poet or a poet-type thinker, in short, this is a unified, most essential, and most robust writer and poet. What we want to learn and expect to achieve is such a writer and poet. Lu Xun is one of the great writers of this kind of essential, robust, popular and human nature.
    By studying and learning from such writers, we will also feel that the unity of thought and literature is an important key.
    For example, in Lu Xun, this kind of unity can explain all his thoughts and also explain all his literature. His literature and literary talents always developed along with his thoughts and thought talents. The reason lies in the so-called ability of thought, which is the sharp and in-depth sense of political awareness, the ability to analyze and synthesize the reality of society and people's lives; and especially in the fact that the writer has a sharp and in-depth sense, understanding, and judgment of the progressive thoughts produced by the people's lives and the people's struggles in life. This is always the most fundamental, and it is not innate, but is cultivated time and again through contact with the people, especially by participating in various life struggles in the masses of the people.
    But people's political judgment and thoughts on real life are always accompanied by a kind of artistic feeling, a kind of goodwill or antipathy, that is, so-called emotion. This is the so-called emotion, which not only accompanies thought, but people often delve into thought through emotion first. Not only writers and poets, but any ordinary person should not obliterate emotion and make themselves an unfeeling person; this is helpful and necessary for thought. A person who can think must be a person who can feel, just as a person who fakes feelings must also be a person who fakes thoughts. Correctly speaking, emotion often guides us to think, and thought guides our emotions. It is very clear that a person who wholeheartedly and with all enthusiasm pursues his revolutionary cause and thoughts, his thoughts and emotions are always unified. Conversely, either both will be depleted and impoverished, or they will be contradictory and ununified.
    Here, I feel that there are places where we deserve to reflect and should learn. We oppose false thoughts, and we also oppose false emotions. We learn to observe problems in depth, learn scientific methods of thought, master the correct Marxism-Leninism Mao Zedong Thought, and also cultivate beautiful, honest, and profound emotions. We must have correct thoughts, and we must also have emotions that are good at joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness. This is one.
    Secondly, I said above that learning Lu Xun's thoughts is correctly saying learning his talent for thought. This means that in the early stage his thoughts had some incorrect parts, not in line with Marxism-Leninism, but as a whole, his thoughts were progressive and revolutionary; and most of them, especially in the later stage, were scientific, Marxist-Leninist and in line with Marxism-Leninism. But thought and the talent for thought are also inseparable. What we pay attention to is that his thought development also brought about the development of his literature, such as from old realism to socialist realism. This also illustrates a reason for the unity of thought and literature. Literature should develop along with thought, which is also one of the places that should be paid attention to when we learn the talent for thought and the talent for literature and the experience of their unification.
    These are what we can see from Lu Xun.
    What we want to learn is such a Lu Xun, that is, Lu Xun whose ability of thought and ability of literature are both very strong and developed in a unified way.
    What we want to improve on our current foundation is indeed ideological and artistic quality. This is to improve the writer's ability of thought and ability of literature.
    I feel that learning and improving according to this guideline is in line with Chairman Mao's instructions, in line with the requirements of the readers, and in line with the direction of our literary development. (Attached picture)

　　思想的才能和文学的才能
    ——鲁迅逝世十四周年感想
    雪峰
    一
    记不得是那一位同志在口头上这样说的：现在有些诗人的诗，满满的一大本，还不及鲁迅的一篇一两千字的杂文，无论在思想上在诗意上。
    这样的话，当作对于一些不好的诗的批评是对的，当作对于鲁迅的杂文的看法也是对的。鲁迅的杂文要比我们很多诗更有思想和诗的要素。
    但我想，这决不是拿鲁迅来压制人；也决不是心目中只有一个鲁迅，好像有了一个鲁迅就一切都看不上眼，一切都可以抹杀了。我想，决不是这样的意思。
    这只是一种反映，说明我们某些诗既没有思想也没有诗。
    可是，我们的诗，别的作品也一样，例如小说、剧本，是必须有思想，又必须有诗有艺术的。
    作家和诗人是必须有政治的、思想的敏感，又必须有诗的、艺术的敏感；有政治的、思想的才能，又必须有诗的、艺术的才能的。
    鲁迅是我们可以和应该学习的，因为他是政治的、思想的天才，又是诗的、文学的天才，尤其是把两种才能统一地发展的天才。
    我们现在还低下和缺少的也的确是这两种统一的才能。
    二
    譬如我们是把鲁迅当作伟大的人民作家和文学家看的，但当作伟大作家看的鲁迅的最大和最基本的特色，就是他是一个革命思想家，一个革命启蒙主义的伟大的战士。
    他的诗和文学上的一切特色，都是从这里产生的，都是建筑在这上面的，都是服务和为了完成他的思想的。所以他的文学的作品，是思想的诗，政治的诗，强有力的生活的概括的诗。
    而因此，把鲁迅当作思想家来看，他的一切文学的特色所起的作用又是怎样的大。他的思想是衬托在珠宝一般的诗的智慧和语言里的。他的新颖深切的诗感和丰厚的诗的情绪，和他的反映了中国民族的智慧和文化优点的文学上的特色，就丰富了他的思想，使他的思想深厚化，并增加无限的活力和光辉。他的艺术的力量使他的思想在传播上能够“不胫而走”。
    有人说，鲁迅因为是一个高强的文学家，所以反而把他的思想家掩盖了。我觉得这个说法并不恰当。因为鲁迅的文学上的高强，就由于他是一个思想家，他的文学上的高强不但来自他的思想的高强，而且也使他的思想家的势力雄伟和提高了。
    又有人说，鲁迅的思想如果不采用文学的表现方法就要好得多，他的文学手腕的优长反而妨碍了他的思想的系统化、明了性和大众化。这个问题，就要复杂得多。第一，思想的表现方法原来是有科学的表现方法和文学的表现方法的分别的。科学的思想和科学的革命理论，就最好而且必须采用科学的表现方法。例如马、恩、列、斯和毛主席，他们是伟大的革命的科学思想家，并且我们还知道他们又都赋有文学的诗的伟大天才本质的，他们为了保证和发展他们思想的科学性，当然采用严密的科学的组织和表现方法。我们甚至可以看得出来，这些伟人当他们从事科学的论著而觉得文学的诗的方法足以妨碍科学性的时候，是竭力压制着他们的文学的诗的天才和气质的。这样，就典范地显示了他们的最科学的表现方法。但他们也把他们丰富深厚的诗的情绪，压缩到他们论著的根底里去；同时，在没有妨碍而反有帮助的时候也采用一些文学的表现方法，所以不但他们的语言是正确的、精练的、科学的而又文学的语言，并且随处可以碰见文学的警句、机智、幽默、讽刺和抒情，等等。我们都感到，像马、恩、列、斯和毛主席等人的著作是特别深厚的，因为不但他们科学的思想是深厚，而且他们的著作也反映了他们热烈深厚的感情。他们是完全用科学表现方法的，但也不妨碍采用一些文学的表现方法，这证明这两种方法也并非怎样冲突的。
    说到学习，不管我们是作家和诗人，首先就应当学习这些伟大的革命导师。譬如说学习思想，则不但思想方法是应该向这些伟人学习，就是表现方法也应该学习，因为不管作家和诗人，表现思想总必须同样表现得正确而合于科学的。而且在这些伟人的著作里，我们也能够学习文学和文学表现方法。我们首先当然应当把这些导师的著作当作革命的科学经典来读，但如果同时也当作古典文学作品来读，也能够学到文学，同时又能得到品质的修养上的好处。
    但他们的思想表现方法究竟是科学的表现方法。这些伟人虽然都有伟大的文学和诗的天才，可是都统一于伟大的思想家。
    鲁迅是作家，文学家。他的思想家是统一于他的文学家的。他的思想，主要的是采用文学的表现方法。文学补助科学之不足，就因为文学除反映了思想之外，还要反映和发扬人民的感情和美的感觉等等。文学以人民的思想为必要，同时又以人民的诗的情绪和优美的感情为必要的。鲁迅反映和发扬了人民的思想，也反映和发扬了人民的感情。也许文学家的他，多多少少地妨碍了他的思想的科学性的发展与完成；但在鲁迅，一个作家和诗人，却完成了反映和发扬人民感情的任务，并且也以诗人和作家的特色发展了他的思想，而在反映和发扬人民思想的任务上有些方面是他独到的，他以诗人的敏感和尖锐的眼光看到了别人所不注意和看不见的地方。这些就都不但是他的文学的特点，也是他的思想的特点。
    所以，我们向诗人而兼思想家的鲁迅学习的，是他的文学，也是他的思想。在现在，更正确的说，是学他的文学的才能和思想的才能，以及两种并重的才能如何统一地发展的经验。
    至于鲁迅的文学表现方法本身上也有些缺点，例如因他的文字的某些隐晦和曲折而使他的某些论点不够直接明了，因而不容易为一般人所理解，这主要的是时代的限制，特别是过去反动黑暗统治压迫他如此的。而且，这些大体上不是他本人所应负责的缺点，在鲁迅也并非主要的。再说系统化问题，我觉得鲁迅的思想还是自成一个系统的，这必须从他的思想是统一于他的文学的表现上去看。总之，这些都不妨碍我们去学习，学习他的思想的和文学的统一的天才。
    说思想家型的诗人也好，说诗人型的思想家也好，总之这是统一的、最本质的和最壮健的作家和诗人。我们所要学习和预期达到的是这样的作家和诗人。鲁迅就是这类本质的、壮健的、人民性和人类性的伟大作家之一。
    研究和学习这样的作家，我们也就会感到那思想和文学的统一是一个重要的关键。
    例如鲁迅，他的那种统一，是可以说明他的全部思想，也可以说明他的全部文学的。他的文学和文学才能总是跟着他的思想和思想才能而发展的。原因就在于所谓思想的能力，就是对于政治的锐敏深入的感觉能力，对于现实社会和人民生活的分析与综合的能力；而尤其在于这就是作家对于人民生活和人民在生活斗争中所产生的前进思想，有锐敏深入的感觉、领悟和判断。这总是最根本的，并且也不是天生的，而是和人民接触，尤其在人民群众中参与了种种生活斗争所历次地培养成的。
    但人对现实生活的政治的判断和思想，总是同时附随着一种艺术的感觉，一种好感或反感，即所谓情绪的。这也就是所谓感情，不但附随着思想，而且人对现实是往往先通过感情而深入到思想的。不但作家和诗人，就是任何普通人，都不应当抹杀感情而使自己成为一个无情的人；这是对思想有帮助的，而且必要的。一个能思想的人，一定是能感情的人，正如一个假情的人也一定是一个假思想的人一样。正确的说，感情是往往引导我们去思想的，而思想是指导我们的感情的。这就很清楚：全心全意全部热情地去趁他的革命事业和思想的人，他的思想和感情总是统一的。反之，就或者是两者都枯竭和贫乏，或者是矛盾而不统一的。
    在这里，我觉得就有着我们值得反省和应该学习的地方。我们反对假的思想，也反对假的感情。我们学习深入地观察问题，学习科学的思想方法，掌握正确的马列主义毛泽东思想，还要培养优美的、诚实的、深厚的感情。我们要有正确的思想，并且也要有善于喜怒哀乐的感情。这是一。
    其次，我在上面说学习鲁迅的思想，正确地说是学习他的思想才能。这是说他的思想在前期是有某部分不正确的，不合马列主义的，可是整个的说，他的思想都是进步的，革命的；而且大部分，尤其后期的，是科学的，是马列主义化和合于马列主义的。但思想和思想才能也是分不开的，我们所注意的是他的思想的发展也就带来他的文学的发展，例如从旧现实主义发展到社会主义的现实主义。这也说明了思想和文学的统一的一个原因。文学应该跟着思想而发展，这也就是我们学习思想的才能和文学的才能及其统一的经验所应注意的地方之一。
    这些都是我们从鲁迅那里所能够看到的。
    我们要学习的就是这样的鲁迅，就是思想的能力和文学的能力都很高强，而且统一地发展的鲁迅。
    我们要在我们现在的基础之上提高的，的确就是思想性和艺术性。这就是要提高作家的思想能力和文学能力。
    依据这样的方针去学习和提高，我觉得是符合毛主席的指示的，符合读者的要求的，也符合我们文学发展的方向的。（附图片）
