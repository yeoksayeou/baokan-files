[This news report] (from this newspaper): The Jilin Municipal Party Committee's industrial rectification meeting was a relatively successful rectification meeting. This meeting only lasted three and a half days, from September 13th to September 17th. Within three and a half days, the spirit of the Northeast Bureau's industrial work rectification meeting was implemented, the main problems in Jilin's industrial production were examined and criticized, and solutions were determined, which everyone felt satisfied with.

The basic key to the success of the meeting lies in: the Municipal Party Committee put 80% of its energy into preparations before the meeting. Before the meeting, the Municipal Party Committee conducted a relatively full investigation and research work according to the spirit of the Northeast Bureau's industrial work rectification meeting in order to grasp the situation. On August 19th, the Municipal Party Committee convened a joint meeting of factory directors, party branch secretaries, and union chairmen to convey the spirit of the Northeast Bureau's industrial rectification meeting, pointing out that the focus of rectification in each factory was to focus on the main problems in business management and to conduct preliminary inspections accordingly. After the meeting, the Municipal Party Committee sent special personnel to six key factories to help them find key points, conduct in-depth inspections, and study solutions. On the other hand, the Municipal Party Committee also held two symposiums for directors of small and medium-sized factories; and instructed the Organization Department, the Trade Union, etc. to formulate special opinions. The Organization Department and the Trade Union also held special meetings to study how the Party and Trade Union work can play a role in production. Based on the above situations, the Municipal Party Committee determined that the meeting would focus on three issues: capital and cost management, quality and technical management, and how Party and Trade Union work can guarantee the realization of these tasks. The wage policy issue was not fully prepared because the situation was not well understood, and it was decided to study and resolve it in the fourth quarter. A week before the meeting, the Municipal Party Committee drafted discussion outlines on the above issues and distributed them to the factories for full preparation; later, the three issues to be discussed were printed out for discussion at the general meeting.

After the above full preparations, and with the leadership core paying attention to grasping the progress of the meeting, the meeting naturally proceeded compactly and lively. On the first day of the meeting, special reports were made on business management, Party work, and Trade Union work. On the second day and the morning of the third day, group discussions were held. On the afternoon of the third day, a general discussion was held. On the morning of the fourth day, the meeting was adjourned, and the afternoon was a summary. In the middle of this, everyone used their brains, looked at documents, talked to relevant staff, and looked for reference materials; learned from the experiences of other regions, focusing on checking capital and cost management, quality and technical management. After this inspection, the incorrect views of everyone only caring about production and not caring about costs, only focusing on quantity and not focusing on quality, and the supply system ideology were criticized. A number of serious problems existing in business management were revealed. For example, in cost management, there was no planned cost reduction, cost calculation but no management, and the basic problem in cost management—quota management—was not fully implemented. Some quotas were set without special personnel to manage them, and some had not yet implemented quotas. This resulted in a waste of labor and raw materials in production. Taking the match factory as an example: in the manufacturing department, double-headed matches, pre-machine and post-machine rods, etc., were wasted, reaching 5% per box. In capital management, the phenomenon of product backlog was the most serious. 19 kinds of products in the city were backlogged by 478.4 million (Northeast currency), and the backlog of products in some small factories accounted for 80% of all working capital. The capital turnover was also too slow: the capital turnover of some factories took more than 300 days, affecting accumulation. Poor product quality is currently the main weakness in production. Because the quality of the matches in the match factory was bad, they could not be sold, and they were preparing to change the brand (trademark); the finished products made by the clothing company did not dare to be sold in the store, so they had to secretly take them to the small market to sell. After these inspections, everyone realized the seriousness of these problems. Some people said: "I used to sleep soundly, but now I'm shocked!" The Party and Trade Union departments also understood how they should guarantee the improvement of business management in the future, overcoming the weaknesses of the past where the Party, government, labor union, and youth league each had their own focus and were not well integrated. At the meeting, serious self-criticism was also carried out, the causes of various shortcomings were analyzed, and improvement methods were proposed. Everyone exchanged experiences in improving work. For example, the paper mill proposed that the current central task of the factory is to strengthen technical management, and introduced the experience of establishing a technical responsibility system and standard operating procedures. This method of exchanging experiences was very enlightening for the comrades who attended the meeting.

After the meeting, the Jilin Municipal Party Committee carried out the following work to further implement the spirit of this meeting. First, the spirit of this meeting was combined with the actual situation of each factory and implemented among all employees, so that these policies became the conscious actions of the masses of employees. Second, according to the spirit of the meeting, each factory further checked its work, analyzed the reasons in depth, proposed improvement methods, and seriously implemented them. The Municipal Party Committee also dispatched cadres to provide specific assistance to each factory.

### 做好准备工作充分掌握情况  吉林工业整风会议开得好  会后并将会议精神深入贯彻到各厂去

　　做好准备工作充分掌握情况
    吉林工业整风会议开得好
    会后并将会议精神深入贯彻到各厂去
    【本报讯】中共吉林市委工业整风会议，是一个比较成功的整风会议。这个会议仅只开了三天半，九月十三日开会，九月十七日结束。在三天半的时间内，贯彻了东北局工业工作整风会议精神，检查、批判了吉林市工业生产中的主要问题，并定出了解决的办法，大家一致感到满意。
    会议开得成功的基本关键在于：市委把百分之八十的精力放在会前的准备工作上。在开会前，市委根据东北局工业工作整风会议精神，进行了比较充分的调查研究工作，以便掌握情况。八月十九日，市委召集各厂厂长、支书、工会主任联席会议，传达东北局工业整风会议精神，指出各厂整风中心在于抓紧经营管理上的主要问题，并据此进行初步检查。会后市委又派专人深入六个重点工厂，帮助他们找重点，深入检查并研究解决办法。另一方面，市委又召开了两次中小工厂厂长座谈会；并责成组织部、工会等拟出专门意见。组织部、工会也分别召开专门会议，研究了党和工会工作在生产中如何发挥作用的问题。市委根据以上各方面情况，确定会议以资金、成本管理，质量与技术管理及党和工会工作如何保证这些任务实现等三个问题为中心。工资政策问题，因掌握情况不够，未做充分准备，决定在第四季度研究解决。会前一星期，市委就以上问题拟定了讨论提纲，发到各厂使之充分准备；以后又将要讨论的三个问题印出供大会讨论。
    经过了以上的充分准备，加以开会后领导核心注意掌握进行情况，会议自然就开得紧凑活泼。会议第一天进行了关于经营管理、党的工作及工会工作的专题报告，第二天及第三天上午小组讨论，第三天下午大会讨论，第四天上午休会，下午总结。在这中间，大家动脑子，看文件、找有关工作人员谈话，找参考材料；学习其他地区经验，着重对资金、成本管理，质量与技术管理进行了检查。经过这一检查，批判了大家只管生产不管成本、只重数量不重质量的不正确观点和供给制思想。揭开了经营管理上存在的若干严重问题。比如，在成本管理上，未曾有计划地降低成本，成本有计算无管理，以及对成本管理中的基本问题—定额管理贯彻得不够，有的确定了定额无专人掌握，有的尚未实行定额。因而造成生产中劳动力与原材料的浪费。只以火柴厂为例：制造部双头火柴，机前机后杆等浪费，每箱即达百分之五。在资金管理上，产品积压现象最为严重。全市十九种产品即积压了四、七八四亿（东北币），有些小工厂积压产品竟占全部流动资金的百分之八十。资金周转也太慢：有的工厂资金周转一次竟需三百多天，影响积累。产品质量低劣更是目前生产中的主要弱点。火柴厂因火柴质量坏卖不出去，准备换牌子（商标）；被服公司作出的成品不敢在门市部出售，只好偷偷拿到小市上去卖。经过了这些检查，大家认识到这些问题的严重性，有的人说：“过去睡一觉，现在吓一跳！”党和工会部门也懂得了今后应如何保证经营管理的改进，克服过去党、政、工、团各有重点结合不够的弱点。会议中并认真进行自我批评，分析了产生各种缺点的原因，提出了改进办法。在改进工作方面大家互相交流经验。如造纸厂提出该厂目前的中心工作是加强技术管理，并介绍了建立技术责任制，标准操作法的经验。这种互相交流经验的办法，对到会同志很有启发。
    会议结束后，吉林市委又进行了如下工作，以进一步贯彻此次会议精神。首先，将此次会议精神，结合各厂实际情况，贯彻到全体职工中去，使这些政策变为职工群众的自觉行动。其次，根据会议精神，各厂进一步检查工作，深入分析原因，提出改进办法，认真加以贯彻。市委并抽出干部予各厂以具体帮助。
