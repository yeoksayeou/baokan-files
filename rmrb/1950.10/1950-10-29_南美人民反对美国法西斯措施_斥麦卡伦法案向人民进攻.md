    [Xinhua News Agency, 28th dispatch] The fascist McCarran Act passed by the U.S. Congress in late September has not only been widely opposed domestically, but has also been denounced by the people of Latin American countries. According to a report from the Electric News Agency: Fifty Mexican celebrities sent an open letter to Truman, accusing the McCarran Act and opposing the imprisonment of American Communist leaders and progressives, as well as other attacks on the freedom of the American people. Signatories to the letter included Toledano, Chairman of the Latin American Labor Federation, Guzman, Secretary-General of the Mexican Confederation of Workers and Peasants, Noble, Secretary-General of the Mexican Peace Committee, Molina, Secretary of the Mexican Miners and Metalworkers Union, Bremauntz and Fontes, Justices of the Mexican Supreme Court, General Jara, former Minister of the Navy, General Tejeda, former Minister of the Interior, as well as famous artists, historians, and medical scientists.
    Puerto Rican Communist Party Chairman Iglesias condemned the McCarran Act, stating that the purpose of the act is to suppress all resistance to the war plans of American financial groups through terror. It is not only aimed at Communists, but also at all other anti-imperialist progressive forces. In Puerto Rico, the act is intended to strengthen colonial rule and suppress all those who fight for peace, workers' rights, and national independence.

　　南美人民反对美国法西斯措施
    斥麦卡伦法案向人民进攻
    【新华社二十八日讯】美国国会于九月下旬通过的法西斯麦卡伦法案，不仅在国内受到广泛反对，而且也受到拉丁美洲国家人民的斥责。据电通社消息：墨西哥名流五十人曾以公开信致杜鲁门，指责麦卡伦法案，并反对监禁美国共产党领袖和进步人士以及其他对美国人民自由的进攻。在信上签名的包括拉丁美洲劳工联合会主席托列达诺、墨西哥工农联盟总书记古兹曼、墨西哥和平委员会总书记诺布尔、墨西哥矿工及金属工人工会书记莫利诺、墨西哥最高法院大法官布莱芒兹及佛昂特斯、前海军部长雅拉将军、前内政部长特日达将军以及著名艺术家、历史家、医学家等。
    波多黎各共产党主席伊格里夏斯痛斥麦卡伦法案称：该法案的目的是用恐怖的方法压制一切对美国财阀战争计划的反抗，它不仅针对共产党人，而且也是针对其他一切反帝国主义的进步力量的，在波多黎各，这个法案就是要加强殖民政权，压制所有为和平、工人权利和国家独立而奋斗的人们。
