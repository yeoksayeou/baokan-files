　　Beijing Executes the Policy of Combining Suppression and Leniency
    Seriously打击 Counter-Revolutionary Activities
    Over a Year, 177 Major Espionage Cases Uncovered, Severe Sanctions Imposed on Arch-Criminals Who Refuse to Repent
    [Our Newspaper] Over the past year and more, the Beijing Military Control Commission and the People's Government have resolutely suppressed counter-revolutionary activities and actively carried out the work of eliminating counter-revolutionary remnants in accordance with the policy of "combining suppression with leniency," severely打击 the counter-revolutionary conspiracies of American imperialism and the remnant Kuomintang bandit gangs, suppressed the dying struggle of counter-revolutionary elements, stabilized the social order of the people's capital, enabled the broad masses of the people to live and work in peace and contentment, and at the same time, provided guaranteed conditions for the restoration and development of production and construction undertakings.
    Since the liberation of Beijing, the city's Kuomintang secret agents and saboteurs have been arrested first, scattered soldiers and bandits have been concentrated, and the chaos in the early days of liberation has been eliminated. Then, the registration of secret agents and reactionary party and league personnel was carried out, and the Qinghe Training Brigade for managing and training secret agents was established to implement management, training, and reform. Furthermore, continuous detection and case solving were carried out to vigorously打击 the main lurking enemies. In the one year and seven months up to the end of September this year, the Public Security Bureau of the People's Government has uncovered a total of 177 major espionage cases. These included six cases of espionage by U.S. imperialist overseas intelligence department agents such as Xiong Xianli; sixteen cases of Kuomintang secret service bosses Zhang Yinwu, Wu Lei Yuan and others plotting riots; eleven cases of economic sabotage of the people's economic construction by secret agents of the Puppet Military Statistical Bureau's Economic Special Group Xu Wenqiao forging banknotes, and Central Bureau of Statistics secret agent Zhang Jianwei supplying communist industrial and mining intelligence; one hundred and twenty cases of secret agents of the Puppet Pacification Headquarters, Ji Zhaoxiang, providing communist intelligence and other conspiracies of latent sabotage; and twenty-four cases of secret agents impersonating our staff to murder, rob, and endanger the lives and property of the people. A total of 1,565 secret agents and 24 U.S. imperialist spies were arrested. Our public security organs, based on the policy of combining suppression and leniency of "the ringleaders must be dealt with, the coerced will not be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded," imposed severe sanctions on the most heinous masterminds. As of the end of September this year, in addition to the execution of a group of secret service bandit leaders such as Ji Zhaoxiang, who committed heinous crimes, a group of habitual murderers and extremely wicked local bullies were also executed. In addition, 168 counter-revolutionary elements have been sentenced to imprisonment by the Military Control Commission or the court, respectively. In addition, 392 general secret agents and 3,430 reactionary party and league personnel at the district level or above were ordered to register and then subjected to management, training, or control. Among them, 1,763 have been escorted to Qinghe Farm to force them to reform themselves through labor and start anew. The rest are under the control of the Public Security Bureau and are being investigated. Some of them who have sincerely repented and have been proven by facts have had their control shortened or lifted, but those who continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities have been given severe punishment.
    The achievements were mainly due to the correct leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, combined with the specific situation of each stage, correcting the ideas of "arrogance and underestimation of the enemy" and "one-sided leniency," strictly implementing the correct policy of combining suppression and leniency, and publicizing the cases at any time, exposing the tricks of the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek, educating the masses, raising vigilance, and crushing the enemy's sabotage conspiracies at any time.

　　京市执行镇压与宽大结合的方针
    严重打击反革命活动
    一年多破获重大特务案一百七十七件对怙恶不悛的首要分子给予严厉制裁
    【本报讯】北京市军管会和人民政府一年多来根据“镇压与宽大相结合”的方针坚决镇压了反革命活动和积极进行了肃清反革命残余的工作，予美帝国主义和国民党残余匪帮的反革命阴谋活动以严重的打击，镇压了反革命分子垂死挣扎的气焰，安定了人民首都的社会秩序，使广大人民得以安居乐业，同时，在恢复和发展生产建设事业上，也提供了保证的条件。
    京市自解放后，首先拘捕了市内国民党特务破坏分子，集中了散兵游勇，消除了解放初期的混乱现象，继而进行了特务分子和反动党团人员登记，并成立管训特务分子的清河训练大队，实行管训改造。并且继续不断地侦捕破案，大力打击了首要的潜伏敌人。至今年九月底的一年零七个月中，人民政府公安局共破获重大特务案一百七十七件。其中包括美帝海外情报部特务熊先立等间谍案六件；国民党特务头子张荫梧、吴雷远等阴谋组织暴动案十六件；伪军统局经济特别组特务徐文乔伪造钞票，中统局特务张健伟供匪工矿情报等阴谋破坏人民经济建设案十一件；伪绥靖总队特务计兆祥供匪情报等阴谋潜伏破坏案一百二十件及特务分子冒充我工作人员杀人、抢劫危害人民生命财产安全等案二十四件。共逮捕特务分子一千五百六十五名，美帝间谍二十四名。我公安机关依据“首恶者必办、胁从者不问、立功者受奖”镇压与宽大相结合的政策，对其中怙恶不悛的首要分子，给予了严厉的制裁。截至今年九月底止，除处决了计兆祥等一批罪恶滔天的特务匪首外，并处决了一批杀人惯匪及罪大恶极的恶霸分子。另有反革命分子一六八名已由军管会或法院分别判处徒刑。此外，一般的特务分子三九二名，反动党团区级以上人员三四三○名经勒令登记后，加以管训或管制。其中一七六三名已押解清河农场，强迫他们在劳动中改造自己，重做新人。其余的均在公安局管制下，加以考察，其中有些真心悔悟并经过事实证明了的，已经缩短管制或取消了管制，但有些继续进行反革命活动者，则给了他们以严厉的惩处。
    这些成绩的获得，主要是北京市的中共党委和人民政府的正确领导，结合每一阶段的具体情况，纠正了“骄傲轻敌”和“片面宽大”的思想，严肃地执行了镇压与宽大相结合的正确政策，并随时把案件公布，揭穿美蒋诡计，教育群众，提高警惕，随时粉碎敌人的破坏阴谋。
