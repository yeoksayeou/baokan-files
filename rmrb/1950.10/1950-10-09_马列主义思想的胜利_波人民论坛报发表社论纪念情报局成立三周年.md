Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, October 6th: Polish newspapers all published special articles on the 5th, celebrating the third anniversary of the establishment of the Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau. The Polish United Workers' Party organ, People's Forum, published an editorial entitled "The Victory of Marxism-Leninism," stating: Communist parties of all countries are currently implementing the principles listed in the declaration adopted by the Information Bureau's first conference, and the peace policy of the anti-imperialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Their tireless activities have made a tremendous contribution to the great world peace movement.

The editorial then discussed the activities of the Information Bureau over the past three years, stating: The work of the Information Bureau has helped the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries to arm themselves with Marxism-Leninism, helped them to employ Bolshevik strategy and tactics and strengthen internationalism, helped them to wage a relentless struggle against nationalism, a vicious weapon used by imperialists against the communist and progressive movements, thereby helping to further the victory of Marxism-Leninism.

The editorial pointed out the significance of the Information Bureau's resolution on the situation of the Yugoslav Communist Party, stating: This resolution helped Poland eliminate right-leaning deviations in the workers' movement and prevented the counter-revolutionary elements within the Hungarian Workers' Party and the Bulgarian Communist Party from obstructing the revolutionary cause. The editorial emphasized: This resolution alerted the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries to the great dangers that would arise from even a slight deviation from the Leninist-Stalinist party or from neglecting the role of the Soviet Union.

　　马列主义思想的胜利
    波人民论坛报发表社论纪念情报局成立三周年
    【新华社六日讯】波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰各报均于五日发表专文，庆祝共产党与工人党情报局成立三周年。波兰统一工人党机关报人民论坛报以“马列主义思想的胜利”为题发表社论称：世界各国共产党都正在实施情报局首届会议通过的宣言中所列举的原则，及以苏联为首的反对帝国主义阵营的和平政策。他们孜孜不倦的活动，对于伟大的世界和平运动有着巨大的贡献。
    社论继论述情报局成立三年来的活动称：情报局的工作，有助于各国共产党和工人党以马列主义武装自己，有助于他们运用布尔什维克的战略与策略和加强国际主义，有助于对帝国主义者所加于共产主义和进步运动的一个恶毒的武器——民族主义进行无情的斗争，从而有助于使马列主义的思想获得更进一步的胜利。
    社论指出情报局关于南斯拉夫共产党的情况的决议的重要意义称：这一决议曾帮助波兰铲除了工人运动中的右倾偏向，而且使匈牙利工人党和保加利亚共产党内反革命分子的阴谋计划无法妨害革命事业。社论强调指出：这一决议警惕着全世界各国的共产党和工人党，使它们知道即使稍有背弃列宁——斯大林的党，或忽视苏联的作用的企图，都会产生很大的危险。
