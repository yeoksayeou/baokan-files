　　Our Achievements and Unachieved Goals
　　Hu Qiaomu
　　On the occasion of commemorating the 14th anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death, we have witnessed the enormous and undeniable achievements of our literary and artistic work. We have finally and fundamentally cleared away the old "literature and art" that Lu Xun detested and fought to the death against throughout his life—the anti-people, anti-revolutionary, feudal, imperialist, and Kuomintang executioner-type "literature and art"—and have developed a new people's, revolutionary literature and art throughout the country. Under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's directives, new works serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, including popular works specifically for them, have appeared in large numbers in publications, picture albums, on the stage, and on the screen, and have been welcomed by millions and tens of millions of people. A new force of writers and young literary and art workers has grown into a powerful force in the struggle, and many old literary and art workers have also joined this force with new enthusiasm. It should be said that this is a great, earth-shattering event in the history of Chinese literature and art, and it is a great victory of Lu Xun and his successors' long-term struggle. It is completely incorrect to ignore and diminish the importance of this victory.
　　Because we live in the victorious era of the people's revolution, it is easy to understand that we have surpassed Lu Xun not only in the scale of our work but also in the degree of integration with the masses of the people. A broad front has been occupied; what is needed is to start new and solemn construction on this front. This, however, is a task of doubled difficulty. A loud alarm bell is awakening us, saying: "To win country-wide victory is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand li. ... The road ahead is longer, the work greater, and the more arduous." Here, we immediately discover that in several of the most important aspects, we still lag behind Lu Xun. Our motherland's war of liberation has not yet ended and is on the verge of new attacks by the enemy. The global struggle between light and darkness in our era is more intense and significant than during Lu Xun's lifetime. This makes us feel the loss of Lu Xun even more painfully, because precisely on our literary and art front, we lack Lu Xun's combativeness, sharpness, and seriousness in political life. How urgently the people demand a bugler of the march forward! But we often write some innocuous occasional pieces to replace combative works. Many of our comrades show an intolerable sloppy attitude toward literary and artistic undertakings. They refuse to study seriously and are satisfied with supplying the people with crudely made products. ... All of this is disproportionate to the victory we have already obtained, disproportionate to the demands of hundreds of millions of people who have been liberated for literature and art, and disproportionate to the serious labor of our working class and peasant class on the economic front. We have been too long without criticizing this phenomenon. In order to continue to move forward, now is the time to carry out this criticism!
　　Lu Xun's spirit of combat, spirit of work, and spirit of learning—these are the best prescriptions for curing the laziness, nonchalance, aimless busyness, and perfunctoriness among us. Spread and use this prescription more! Let us study Lu Xun more, let us have more old writers and new youths catch up with Lu Xun in terms of political enthusiasm and artistic seriousness—this is by no means an excessive demand, it is the inescapable duty of Lu Xun's successors, and we have so many more favorable conditions to do it today than Lu Xun did. Therefore, we should not only do this, but we will certainly be able to do this, and many people are already doing this.
　　We have already achieved a great victory, and relying on our continued efforts, relying on our self-criticism and improvement of work, we will surely consolidate and expand this victory. As we look at the distant future, let us cheer: Long live all the Lu Xuns, big and small, who are living and will live!

　　我们所已经达到的和还没有达到的成就
    胡乔木
    在纪念鲁迅先生去世十四周年的时候，我们看到了我们的文艺工作的巨大的和不容怀疑的成就。我们终于从根本上廓清了鲁迅所痛恨而毕生与之作殊死战的那些反人民的、反革命的、封建主义的、帝国主义的、国民党刽子手的旧“文艺”，而在全国范围内发展了人民的、革命的新文艺。在毛泽东同志所指示的方针下，新的为工农兵服务的作品，其中包括专为供给工农兵的大众化作品，大量地出现在出版物上，画册上，舞台上，银幕上，得到了几百万和几千万人民的欢迎。新的作家和青年文艺工作者的队伍，在斗争中生长成了强大的力量，而很多旧的文艺工作者也纷纷以新的热情加入了这个队伍。应当说，这是中国文艺历史上翻天覆地的伟大事变，这是鲁迅和他的后继者们长期奋斗的伟大胜利。忽视和降低这个胜利的重要性，是完全不正确的。
    由于我们是生活在人民革命的胜利时代，我们不但在工作规模上而且在与人民群众相结合的程度上都超过了鲁迅，这是容易理解的。广阔的阵地已经占领了，需要的是在这个阵地上着手新的庄严的建设。这却是一个加倍困难的任务。声音洪亮的警钟在惊醒我们说：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。”在这里，我们马上就发现了在几个最重要的方面我们仍然落在鲁迅的后面。我们的祖国的解放战争还没有完结，而且正处在敌人的新进攻的边缘上，我们时代的光明与黑暗的世界性斗争比鲁迅生前更加紧张和显著，这使我们更加痛感鲁迅的丧失，因为在我们的文艺战线上，恰恰缺少着对于政治生活的鲁迅式的战斗性、敏锐性和严肃性。人民是多么迫切地要求着进军的号手啊！但是我们却常常写了些不关痛痒的应景文字来代替战斗的作品。我们有许多同志在文艺事业上表现不能容忍的潦草态度，他们拒绝认真的学习，而满足于用粗制滥造的生产品供给人民。……一切这些，都和我们所已经得到的胜利不相称，都和几万万人民的已经被解放了的对于文学艺术的要求不相称，都和我们的工人阶级和农民阶级在经济战线上的严重的劳动不相称。对于这种现象，我们已经太长久地没有进行批评。为了继续前进，现在是进行这种批评的时候了！
    鲁迅式的战斗精神、工作精神和学习精神——这是医治我们中间的懒懒散散、嘻嘻哈哈、无事奔忙而又敷衍了事的最好药方。更多地传布和使用这个药方吧！让我们更多地温习鲁迅，让我们有更多的老作家和新青年在政治的热情和艺术的严肃性方面赶上鲁迅吧，——这绝对不是什么苛求，这是鲁迅的后继者不可逃避的天职，而且在我们今天做起来比鲁迅多了不知多少的有利条件，因此我们不但应当这样做，也一定能够这样做，也已经有不少人这样做着。
    我们已经得到了伟大的胜利，而且依靠我们的继续努力，依靠我们的自我批评和改善工作，我们定将巩固和扩大这个胜利。当我们注视着遥远的前方的时候，让我们欢呼：活着的和将要活着的一切大大小小的鲁迅们万岁！
