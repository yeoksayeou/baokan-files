　　What Problems Were Solved in the Anyang Prefectural Party Committee Delegate Meeting?
　　Our reporter Shang Kai
　　The Anyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Pingyuan Province, from September 15th to October 8th, convened a delegate meeting to inspect work and conduct rectification. Two hundred and seventy-nine delegates attended, of whom district-level cadres accounted for more than 90 percent of all delegates.
　　Looking at the overall situation in Anyang: Since the Second Provincial Party Congress, the tendency to neglect leadership in production has been reversed, the relationship between the Party and the masses has improved somewhat, and a new style of work has begun to grow. However, due to the large proportion of cadres at the district level who come from peasant backgrounds, their political and cultural levels are relatively low. In the great transition from war and land reform to peaceful construction, they lack systematic ideological education from the Party, are insensitive to new things, are limited to past experiences, and the phenomena of demanding enjoyment, comparing qualifications, and being complacent are also relatively common. The Party's combat effectiveness has been eroded, fostering commandism and bureaucratic work styles, which have hindered and harmed production and construction. The Party Congress, in accordance with the spirit of rectification, focused on production and construction work, adopted a comparison of good and bad examples, carried out criticism and self-criticism, and focused on examining, analyzing, and resolving the following issues. It is prepared to continue rectification after the meeting, in conjunction with current work.

　　Analyzing and Criticizing Commandism and Beginning to Establish a Mass Perspective
　　During the meeting, by examining the actual results of the work, it was recognized that there was a serious commandist work style in the execution of tasks. Many cadres not only failed to implement policies in their work, but even distorted them, turning policies into tools to coerce the masses. For example, in order to complete tasks, they wrongly applied the principle of the minority being subordinate to the majority, thus forcing merchants to return to their hometowns to catch insects, forcing coal miners to return to their villages to participate in production competitions, and generally emphasizing that "this is in the interests of all the villagers, and no one can violate it." Because of the purely task-oriented perspective of the cadres, formalism was also very serious in the work. They emphasized scale, craved speed, only looked at numbers, not at results, and were satisfied with the booming and lively shock movements. Even weeding was done in a rush. The phenomenon of false reports also arose from this. Some cadres often reported plans as achievements to higher levels, making it impossible for leading organs to grasp the true situation below. Many cadres relied only on cadres and not on the masses in their work, wrongly believing that "as long as the village cadres' thinking is clear, everything will be easy to handle." Therefore, the awakening of the masses was neglected in the deployment and execution of tasks. For example, holding field technical training classes was something that the masses welcomed, but in execution, they restricted women from visiting their parents' homes and forced them to stop grinding and go to the fields to learn techniques. When Anyang implemented vaccination, they divided up the village, patrolled, and stood guard. In order to pursue numbers, they forced pregnant women to be vaccinated, resulting in injury to life. As a result, good things turned into bad things, arousing public dissatisfaction. In areas where the work foundation was weak, the relevant leading organs did not carry out patient propaganda and in-depth mobilization, but only emphasized that they were "stubborn villages" and "backward masses," and therefore took crude measures to force the masses, saying that "stubbornness" and "backwardness" meant "it won't work without coercion." As a result of adopting this commandist method, when it caused opposition from the masses, they said, "Attacking my prestige is damaging the government's prestige." They believed that "if the masses are spoiled, there will be no way to manage them in the future." They even looked for opportunities to attack the masses. For example, in one district of Tangyin County, public grain burden for wheat was unfairly distributed, causing the masses to petition. The district cadres did not examine the work, study the reasons, and look for solutions; instead, they exaggerated the mistakes of the masses, used the excuse of "bad people" being active to carry out attacks, and some cadres even advocated: "The autumn public grain must be assigned more heavily to them, to see who dares to petition, to see what good it does to petition." At the Anyang Prefectural Party Congress, the serious consequences of commandism, where tasks were wanted but not policies, were recognized; and a deep analysis was carried out to find the ideological roots. The main ideological root was the lack of a correct mass perspective among the cadres. Especially after the victory of the war, a sense of complacency grew among the cadres, who believed that "after ten years of guerrilla warfare, if there is no merit, there is hardship, and it doesn't matter if we make some mistakes." Even more wrongly, they believed that "during the guerrilla war, we relied on the masses, and now the masses rely on us." These cadres put themselves above the masses, treating leading the masses as "controlling" the masses, thinking, "You are under my control, how can you not listen to me?" Or they treated the masses with an attitude of grace, thinking, "I led you to turn over, you should repay the debt." They understood the masses' payment of public grain, voluntary transportation, and substitute plowing as "repaying debts," so if the masses were slightly slow, they complained that the masses were backward, and as a result, they could only enforce it by force. After repeated analysis and research, the line between right and wrong was drawn. Everyone unanimously recognized the importance of establishing a mass perspective and following the mass line. Most cadres have begun to look at problems from the perspective of policies, look at the effectiveness of work from the masses, and regard "discussing things with the masses" as a major way to overcome commandism.

　　Liquidating the Petty-Bourgeois Mentality in Production Leadership and Establishing a Complete Perspective on Production and Construction
　　The meeting also found from the inspection of production leadership that cadres generally had a narrow view of purely agricultural production and did not see the relationship between other production and construction and agriculture. Some cadres for a long time did not pay attention to organizing the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, but isolatedly promoted agricultural production, and left industry and commerce alone, and cooperatives did not sell agricultural products. Even agricultural production was simply regarded as "farming." This was first reflected in opposing the interests of the peasants to the interests of the state. They welcomed bank loans and opposed bank collection, always wanting the peasants to get a little benefit and the state to suffer a little loss. Some even said: "Although our national concept is not strong, we still have a peasant concept, as long as the peasants get a little benefit." For example, after the Qixian Industrial and Commercial Section signed a contract with the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau for one million bricks, when it came to delivery, they used good bricks mixed with bad bricks to deceive the Railway Bureau and earn 1,300 piculs of millet, causing losses to construction and state property. Secondly, the relationship between peasants and other classes of people was also unclear. Some even believed that there was only one peasant class in the countryside, so they only took care of the interests of the peasants, and even blindly rejected other classes. This spring, the Sixth District of Tangyin signed a contract between a village cooperative and a blacksmith for the manufacture of farm implements. At that time, the cadre's idea was: "As long as the peasants get the benefit," so they stipulated that three catties of millet would be exchanged for one catty of tools according to last year's iron price. But at that time, the price of iron had risen, and according to the calculation, the workers could not even afford to eat and drink. Therefore, the workers did not pay attention to specifications in production, and the product quality was very low. As a result, the peasants took the tools and could not use them, and the workers also lost 200 catties of millet, causing everyone to blame each other and affecting unity.
　　In addition, narrow empiricism in production leadership was also very serious. Some cadres who led production did not pay attention to the research and improvement of agricultural technology, and the crops in the farms were not as good as those of the peasants, losing their guiding role. Some cadres were not interested in scientific new farm tools, they disliked them as complicated and troublesome, and they were unwilling to actively use and promote them. Some people even put the sprayers at home to water and sweep the floor, but forced the masses to catch insects by hand. The meeting pointed out that this was a reflection of the conservatism of the peasants in the minds of the cadres. After analysis and criticism, everyone recognized that the petty-bourgeois mentality had caused serious losses to production and construction, and realized the necessity of the division of labor and cooperation of the five economic components, each in its place, and strengthened the overall economic point of view.

　　Criticizing the "Left"-Leaning Closed-Doorism Tendency in United Front Work
　　From the inspection of the work of the representative meetings of various sectors held in various places, it was found that there was a general tendency of closed-doorism in the implementation of the united front policy. There were erroneous ideas among the cadres, such as using and simply task-oriented perspectives on the representative meetings, as well as looking down on the mass representatives, comparing history with the representatives, and even not wanting enlightened gentry to participate in the representative meetings. During the meeting process, they often did not seriously listen to the opinions of the representatives, but only considered how to pass their own opinions. Some people said that representatives who dared to raise criticisms to the government were "too difficult to deal with" and "complained." Some representatives mistakenly made grasping the center of the meeting into restricting democratic speech, fearing that the representatives would say something wrong that was "not in line with policy" or "not in line with the interests of the masses." Therefore, the representatives of the representative meeting gradually changed from "all sectors" to "one sector." Some cadres could not understand the policy of uniting intellectuals, thinking that "the workers and peasants won the world, and the literati sit in the world." Seeing a large number of foreign intellectuals participating in the work, some people were afraid that they would take their positions. Why did these incorrect ideas and work styles arise in the implementation of the united front policy? This was mainly due to the narrowness of the cadres' politics, their lack of understanding of the fundamental nature of the people's democratic dictatorship, and the sectarian sentiments and privilege mentality of those who considered themselves meritorious officials at work. After studying Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session and analyzing the specific situation in the countryside, seeing the activities of feudal remnants, they felt that if democracy was not sufficiently developed, dictatorship would inevitably be weak, and they also realized that the situation in which only a few Party member cadres were active without the support of the broad masses was very dangerous. On the contrary, only by earnestly developing democracy and uniting the people of all strata can production and construction be carried out well.

　　安阳地委党代表会议中解决了些什么问题？
    本报记者  商恺
    中共平原省安阳地委，从九月十五日至十月八日，召开了党代表会议，检查工作，进行整风。到会代表二百七十九人，其中区级干部占全体代表百分之九十以上。
    从安阳全区情况来看：自省二次党代会后，转变了忽视领导生产的偏向，党群关系亦获得若干改善，新的作风开始生长。但由于区级干部中，农民出身的比重较大，政治水平和文化水平较低，从战争、土地改革到和平建设的大转变中，缺乏党的系统的思想教育，对新鲜事物缺乏敏感，局限于过去的经验主义，而且要求享受，比资格，居功自满的现象，也较为普遍。党的战斗力受到腐蚀，滋长了强迫命令和官僚主义作风，使生产建设事业受到阻碍和危害。党代会根据整风精神，围绕着生产建设工作，采取好坏典型对比，开展批评和自我批评，着重检查分析与解决了下面几个问题。并准备在会议以后，结合当前工作，继续进行整风。
    分析批判强迫命令作风开始树立群众观点
    会议中通过检查工作的实际效果，认识到执行任务中，存在着严重的命令主义作风。不少干部在工作中不但不能贯彻政策，甚至歪曲政策，将政策变为强制群众的工具。例如为了完成任务，便错误地运用部分人服从多数人的原则，于是强迫商人回乡捕虫，强迫煤矿工人回村参加生产竞赛，笼统地强调“这是全村人民的利益，谁也不能违犯。”由于干部中存在单纯任务观点，工作中形式主义也很严重，讲规模，贪图快，只看数字，不看效果，满足于轰轰烈烈的突击运动。甚至锄苗也要突击。假报告的现象也由此产生。有些干部常把计划当做成绩向上级汇报。使领导机关无法掌握下面的真实情况。许多干部在工作中只依靠干部不依靠群众，错误地认为“只要村干部思想通了，啥事也好办。”因而布置任务、执行任务中便忽视了群众的觉悟，例如：举办田间技术训练班，这本是群众很欢迎的事情，但执行起来，便限制妇女走娘家，强迫卸磨下地学技术。安阳实行防疫注射时，在村子里分兵把口，巡逻站岗，为了追求数字，强迫孕妇注射，以至伤害人命。结果都使好事变成坏事，引起群众不满。对工作基础薄弱地区，有关领导机关不进行耐心的宣传教育与深入发动，只强调是“顽固村庄”、“落后群众”，因而便采取粗暴方式去强迫群众，说是“顽固”“落后”“不强迫不行”。采用这种强迫命令办法的结果，闹得引起群众反对时，便说“打击我的威信，就是损害政府的威信。”认为“把群众惯坏了，以后就没法管了。”甚至寻找机会打击群众。如汤阴县有的区因麦征公粮负担不公，引起群众请愿。区干部不从工作中检讨，研究原因，寻找解决办法；反而夸大群众错误，借口有“坏人”活动，进行打击，有的干部就主张：“秋季公粮非给他派重一些不行，看谁还敢请愿，看请愿有什么好处。”安阳地委党代会上，认识了工作中要任务不要政策的强迫命令作风的严重恶果；并进行了深刻的分析，找出了思想根源。这种思想根源，主要是干部缺乏正确的群众观点。特别是战争胜利之后，干部中滋长着居功骄傲思想，认为“十年游击战争，没有功劳有苦劳，犯些错误也没啥。”甚至更错误地认为“在游击战争时，依靠群众，现在群众依靠我们。”这些干部就把自己放在群众之上，把领导群众当做“管制”群众，认为“你受我管，能不听我的话吗？”或者是以恩赐观点对待群众，认为“我领导你们翻了身，你们就应该报恩还债。”将群众交纳公粮、义运、代耕等，都理解为“欠账还债”，因此群众稍有迟缓，便埋怨群众落后，结果只有强制执行。经过这样反复的分析研究，划清了是非界限。大家一致认识到，树立群众观点，走群众路线的重要性。大多数干部，已开始从政策上看问题，从群众中去看工作效果，并把“有事和群众商量”，作为克服命令主义的一项主要办法。
    清算生产领导中的小农思想树立完整的生产建设观点
    会上又从检查生产领导中，发现干部中普遍存在着狭隘的单纯农业生产观点，看不到其他生产建设与农业的关系。干部中有的是长时期不注意组织城乡物资交流，却孤立地提农业生产，并对工、商业放任不管，合作社也不推销农产品。甚至将农业生产简单的看成是“种地”。这首先表现在将农民利益与国家利益对立起来。欢迎银行贷款，反对银行收款，总想叫农民沾点光，叫国家吃点亏。甚至说：“虽然我们的国家观念不强，可是还有农民观念，只要农民沾了光就行”。例如：淇县工商科与郑州铁路局，签订一百万砖的合同后，到交货时，便以好砖加坏砖，欺哄了铁路局，赚取一千三百石小米。使建设事业与国家资财受到损失。其次对于农民与其他阶层人民的关系也搞不清。甚至认为农村只有一个农民阶级，因此只照顾农民的利益，甚至盲目的排斥其他阶级。今年春天，汤阴六区为一个村合作社与铁匠订立制造农具的合同，当时干部思想是：“只要农民沾光就行”，于是便按去年铁价规定三斤小米换一斤工具。但当时铁价已涨，计算起来，工人连吃喝都顾不住。因此工人生产中也就不讲规格，产品质量很低。结果是农民拿了工具不能用，工人还赔了二百斤小米。闹的大家互相埋怨，影响团结。
    另外，在领导生产中狭隘的经验主义也很严重。有些领导生产的干部不注意研究提高农业技术，农场的庄稼反不如农民的好，失掉了指导作用。有些干部对科学的新式农具不感兴趣，嫌复杂，怕麻烦，不肯积极的使用和推广。有些人甚至把喷雾器放在家里洒水扫地，却强迫群众用手去捕虫。会议指出这是农民的保守性在干部思想上的反映。经过分析批判，大家认识了小农思想，使生产建设受到了严重的损失，体会到五种经济的分工合作，各得其所的必要，加强了全面的经济观点。
    批判统战工作中的“左”倾关门主义偏向
    从检查各地召开的各界代表会的工作中，发现执行统战政策中普遍存在着关门主义倾向。干部中对代表会存在着利用和单纯任务观点，以及看不起群众代表，和代表比历史，甚至不愿开明士绅参加代表会议等错误思想。在会议过程中，常常不认真听取代表的意见，而只考虑如何通过自己的意见。有些人说敢于向政府提出批评意见的代表是“太难缠”，是“发牢骚”。有些代表错误地把掌握会议中心弄成约束民主发言，怕代表说错了“不合政策”，“不合群众利益”。因而代表会的代表就由“各界”逐渐变为“一界”。有些干部对团结知识分子的政策也想不通，认为是“工农打天下，文人坐天下”。看到大批外来知识分子参加工作，有些人就惧怕顶了自己的位置。在执行统战政策中，为什么产生这些不正确的思想作风呢？这主要是干部政治上的狭隘性，不懂人民民主专政的根本性质，以功臣自居的宗派情绪、特权思想在作怪。经过学习毛主席在三中全会的报告，和分析农村的具体情况后，看到封建残余的活动，才感到民主发扬不够、专政势必无力，也认识到只有少数党员干部活动，而无广大群众支持的情况是很危险的。相反的，只有认真发扬民主，团结各阶层人民，才能把生产建设事业搞好。
