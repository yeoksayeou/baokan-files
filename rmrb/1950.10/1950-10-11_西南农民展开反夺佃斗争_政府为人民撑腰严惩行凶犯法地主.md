Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 6th—Peasants in various parts of Southwest China are now universally struggling to protect tenancy rights and oppose the illegal acts of some landlords in reclaiming land and undermining rent reduction decrees, and have initially achieved victory.

During and before the autumn harvest, it was discovered in various parts of Southwest China that some landlords violated the decrees issued by the Southwest Military and Political Committee regarding the protection of tenancy rights and "landlords are not allowed to collect rent in advance before the harvest," either by collecting rent in advance or forcibly reclaiming land. According to statistics from two townships in Wenjiang County, Western Sichuan Administrative Region, 146 landlords recently reclaimed 925 mu of tenanted land from 220 tenant households. According to statistics from two townships in Changshou County, Eastern Sichuan Administrative Region, landlords also reclaimed tenanted land yielding more than 1,500 shi of rent grain from farmers in the four months from January to April this year. These landlords violated government decrees, resorted to various tricks to coerce farmers, and achieved their goals of reclaiming land or collecting rent in advance. Some even beat and killed farmers. In Bishan County, Eastern Sichuan Administrative Region, landlord Gong Mingde, due to reclaiming land and forcing tenants to move, even committed violence with a knife, seriously injuring a tenant. In Rongjing County, Xikang Province, a landlord even beat tenant Li Chaozong to death for reclaiming land.

The occurrence of these serious phenomena, in addition to the fact that the masses of peasants in various places have not been fully mobilized, the rural regime has not been fundamentally transformed, and landlords and their agents have infiltrated peasant association organizations to oppress peasants, is also due to the fact that some district and township cadres have not correctly implemented the rent reduction policy. For example, the People's Government of a certain district in Tongliang County, Eastern Sichuan, mistakenly believed that landlords could reclaim land as long as the tenants "agreed." Cadres in Linshui County also only verbally called on farmers to reason with landlords who reclaimed land, without providing them with actual support. To this end, governments at all levels in Southwest China have reiterated rent reduction decrees, strictly prohibiting landlords from reclaiming land and collecting rent in advance. Landlords in Bishan, Rongjing, and other counties who committed violence and broke the law due to reclaiming land have been severely punished by the local people's governments according to law. Various localities have also launched widespread publicity campaigns on rent reduction and land protection decrees, and trained rural work cadres and peasant activists.

Currently, peasants in various places are rising up to demand that landlords return the land. The Peasant Association of Wenxing Township, Wenjiang County, Western Sichuan, led peasants to reason with law-breaking landlords and recovered the reclaimed tenancy rights. In addition, peasants in Zunyi County, Guizhou Province, Xindu County, Western Sichuan Region, and Dianjiang County, Eastern Sichuan Region, have also risen up to reason with landlords, opposing land reclamation and advance rent collection. As long as the landlords admit their mistakes and return the reclaimed tenanted land and the rent grain collected in advance as scheduled, the government and the peasants will not pursue the matter further.

### 西南农民展开反夺佃斗争  政府为人民撑腰严惩行凶犯法地主

　　西南农民展开反夺佃斗争
    政府为人民撑腰严惩行凶犯法地主
    【新华社重庆六日电】西南各地农民，现在正普遍为保护佃权，为反对部分地主夺佃、破坏减租法令的不法行为而斗争，并已初步取得了胜利。
    在秋收和秋收以前，西南各地发现了部分地主违犯西南军政委员会颁布的关于保护佃权与“地主不准在收获前预收地租”的法令，或预收地租，或强行夺佃。据川西行政区温江县两个乡的统计，即有一百四十六户地主，在最近向二百二十户佃农夺去佃田九百二十五亩。又据川东行政区长寿县两个乡的统计，地主在今年一月到四月四个月中，也向农民夺去了一千五百余市石租谷的佃田。这些地主违反政府法令玩弄种种花样胁迫农民，达到他们夺佃或预收地租的目的。甚至有打、杀农民的。川东行政区璧山县地主龚明德因夺佃逼迫佃户搬家，竟持刀行凶，重伤佃户。西康省荣经县一个地主竟因夺佃打死了佃农李朝宗。
    这些严重现象的发生，除由于各地农民群众还没有充分发动起来，乡村政权尚未根本改造，农民协会组织内又有地主及其代理人混入欺压农民等以外，其重要原因之一是某些区乡干部没有正确执行减租政策。如川东铜梁县某区人民政府，竟错误地认为地主夺佃，只要佃户“同意”就可以。邻水县干部也只在口头上号召了一下农民向夺佃的地主讲理，而未给农民以实际支持。为此，西南各地各级人民政府特重申减租法令，严禁地主夺佃和预收地租。上述璧山、荣经等县因夺佃行凶犯法的地主，已经各地人民政府依法严办。各地并展开了对减租保佃等法令的广泛宣传，和训练农村工作干部与农民积极分子。
    现各地农民正纷纷起来要求地主归佃。川西温江县文兴乡的农民协会，就领导农民向违法的地主说理，收回了被夺的佃权。此外，贵州省遵义县、川西区新都县、川东区垫江县等地，农民亦纷纷起来向地主说理，反对夺佃和预收地租。只要地主承认错误，如期退还夺去的佃田和预收的租谷后，政府和农民即不予深究。
