　　Summary of the Northeast Provinces and Cities Newspaper Work Conference
　　Li Zhuoran, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee
　　The Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened the Northeast Provinces and Cities Newspaper Work Conference from September 15th to 21st, with more than 30 representatives from 24 units attending the meeting. This meeting discussed three issues: strengthening ties with the people; further developing criticism and self-criticism; and strengthening the work of the editorial department. Strengthening ties with the people was the central issue discussed at this meeting. Comrade Li Zhuoran, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau, made a summary of these three issues on the last day of the meeting. The full text is as follows:

　　I. Achievements and Shortcomings of this Meeting

　　Because this meeting was well-prepared in advance, and the newspapers of various provinces and cities had made special summaries, and the East Propaganda Department had conducted actual investigations of nine local newspapers, and had put forward the issues to be discussed in advance, although the meeting time was only four days, the main issues were discussed. After the National News Work Conference, some important experiences gained by various newspapers in implementing the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals" and the "Decision of the News Administration on improving newspaper work" were exchanged, so that everyone's understanding of implementing the guidelines instructed by the Central Committee was clearer. This is the main gain of the meeting. Speaking of shortcomings, I feel that the important issue raised at the meeting, that is, the relationship between mass character and guidance, has not been discussed in depth.

　　II. How to understand and strengthen the mass character of provincial and municipal newspapers is the central issue discussed at this meeting.

　　① Full mass character is the basic characteristic of the people's newspaper.

　　Our newspapers are all mass newspapers. From the People's Daily to the Northeast Daily to the newspapers of various provinces and cities, this is the same. Our newspapers should all face the masses, reflect the masses, represent the masses, and educate the masses. We deal with practical problems among the masses, based on the greatest interests of the greatest number of people, and based on the party's line and policies that represent this greatest interest. This is the highest expression of the mass character or mass viewpoint of our newspapers. At the present stage, the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is the concentrated expression of the greatest interests of the people of the whole country. Every newspaper worker must conscientiously study this program to strengthen their mass viewpoint and policy viewpoint.

　　② Do not look at mass character in isolation, and do not generalize or vulgarize the mass viewpoint.

　　What viewpoint and attitude should we take to deal with the issue of mass character? We should treat this issue comprehensively and concretely, rather than one-sidedly and abstractly. For example, the relationship between cadres and the masses, in a general sense, Communist Party members or revolutionary workers are all members of the people, or, are the most active members of the people. Without the masses, there can be no cadres. Cadres and the masses are closely linked. Some comrades see cadres and the masses as opposed to each other, and therefore the question of "running newspapers for cadres or for the masses?" has arisen.

　　Educating the broad area and village cadres and specifically guiding their work is an important task of provincial and municipal newspapers. How to complete this task? Obviously, it is inseparable from the masses. It is important to educate area and village cadres based on the opinions, demands, and model deeds of the masses. For example, if the masses are dissatisfied with the coercive command style of certain area and village cadres, our newspapers should organize criticism from the masses and self-criticism from the cadres in order to improve. This is an important method of improving the guiding role of newspapers on the basis of the masses. Some comrades believe that the needs of cadres are different from the needs of the masses, and that if we want to meet the needs of cadres, we cannot talk about mass character; or that emphasizing mass character will not meet the needs of cadres. These are all one-sided or simple views. Some of our newspapers have not yet learned to properly combine guidance and mass character. In the newspapers, general principles are talked about a lot, and publicity related to the actual situation of the masses is done less. There is too much stuff from above, and too little reflection of the lives and voices of the masses. This is the problem of generalization; or, without analyzing the opinions of the masses, the advanced and the backward opinions are mixed together, and the mass viewpoint and the policy viewpoint are seen as opposed to each other. This is the problem of vulgarization. Both of these practices or views are incorrect. Only by combining guidance and mass character, and unifying the policy viewpoint and the mass viewpoint, is the correct and comprehensive mass viewpoint or mass character.

　　③ Newspaper target audience.

　　Should provincial and municipal newspapers specify a main readership? This is not a question of whether or not to specify, but a question of what actually exists; because the cultural level and actual needs of cadres and the masses are different. If the main readership of the newspaper is not clear, it will make the mistake of generalization. In the past, provincial and municipal newspapers that were well-run were all because they were good at correctly solving the relationship between guidance and mass character according to the main readership. In the past, it was stipulated that the main readership of provincial and municipal newspapers was area and village cadres (or lower-level cadres in cities and enterprises) and the masses with a certain level of culture. This does not mean that everyone should not care about the problems of the general masses. On the contrary, it is necessary to specifically care about and reflect the problems of the masses based on the cultural level and actual needs of this main readership, so as to help them learn among the masses and how to lead or influence the broad masses of the people to struggle to realize the party and government's every specific call in every period. Therefore, the issues that the masses are most concerned about are also the issues that our cadres are most concerned about; if the issues that the masses are most concerned about are not cared about by the cadres, then it is not that there is a contradiction between the needs of the masses and the needs of the cadres, but that the cadres are divorced from the masses. For example, the current affairs issue of opposing the US imperialist war of aggression is an issue that the broad masses and cadres are very concerned about, and our newspapers should report this issue well in order to mobilize and organize the people to participate in this struggle against US aggression. In the past, our newspapers did not pay enough attention to current affairs publicity, which is also a manifestation of the lack of mass character in our newspapers.

　　④ Vigorously develop the work of worker-peasant correspondents and widely establish newspaper reading groups.

　　The work of worker-peasant correspondents in various newspapers has not really been carried out, which is related to our past lack of understanding and emphasis. In the future, we must conscientiously implement the decisions of the National News Conference, boldly carry out this work, and truly make it an important task of the editorial departments of various newspapers.

　　The mass character of newspapers is not abstract. To strengthen the mass character of newspapers, we must first widely develop the work of worker-peasant correspondents and truly establish our newspaper work on the basis of the active participation of the broad masses. The more worker-peasant correspondents who are willing to be responsible for our newspapers and dare to raise questions and opinions, the better the newspapers will be run.

　　We must adopt a serious and responsible attitude towards the work of worker-peasant correspondents and resolutely avoid formalism. Through our hard work, we can make the active elements in the broad masses consciously and voluntarily participate in running newspapers. We must handle the manuscripts of worker-peasant correspondents with caution, summarize past experience, and take more measures to closely connect with worker-peasant correspondents.

　　Widely establishing newspaper reading groups is also an important method for newspapers to closely connect with the masses. In the past, the "Masses' Daily" in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region was very popular among the masses, and the masses there used "our newspaper" to refer to it. In addition to newspaper reading groups, there were also active elements in the countryside who were called "newspaper speakers" and "newspaper transmitters," who conveyed the news in the newspapers to the masses anytime and anywhere. This shows that running newspapers well is a decisive condition for widely establishing newspaper reading groups; on the other hand, widely establishing newspaper reading groups will further help us run newspapers well.

　　⑤ The form of the newspaper should also strive to meet the needs of the masses.

　　The mass character of newspapers is basically determined by the content of the newspapers, but if the form of expression is not appropriate, mass character is difficult to achieve. The most important thing here is the issue of learning the language of the masses. Learning the vivid language of the masses that is rich in ideas is an important condition for strengthening the mass character of newspapers. Other issues such as the printing technology and distribution of newspapers should also strive to be improved to meet the requirements of readers.

　　III. The Issue of Carrying Out Criticism and Self-Criticism

　　① Strengthen the ideological character of criticism.

　　Our criticism should be positive, not simply exposing and accusing, but to analyze it as deeply as possible, and to be full of the spirit of persuasion and education, so that the criticized and the broad masses of readers can be educated.

　　Criticism and self-criticism are regular tasks, but it is not enough to just publish them every day to complete this task. The main thing is to be good at combining the current central work, grasping typical examples, adopting a realistic and seeking truth from facts attitude, and organizing criticism and self-criticism from beginning to end, analyzing the reasons for the shortcomings or errors, and studying how to correct them, so as to achieve the purpose of educating cadres and the masses and improving work.

　　② Do not backlog criticism manuscripts.

　　It is very necessary to treat criticism and self-criticism with caution. It is also right to investigate and study criticism manuscripts that are not clear or not sure before publishing or handling them individually. However, this is fundamentally different from deliberately delaying or condoning errors. In the future, in handling criticism manuscripts, especially criticism manuscripts from the workers and peasants, a strict responsibility system should be established. If the relevant authorities believe that a certain issue needs to be investigated again, they should specifically stipulate how much time is needed and who is responsible for the investigation. The newspaper has the responsibility to urge them on schedule and to criticize irresponsible phenomena.

　　③ Resolutely overcome the phenomenon of suppressing criticism and resisting criticism.

　　After the Party Central Committee issued the decision, various newspapers paid more attention to carrying out criticism and self-criticism, thereby strengthening the guidance of the newspapers. However, the phenomenon of suppressing criticism and resisting criticism is still very serious in some places. In order to better implement the decision of the CPC Central Committee, we must resolutely overcome this phenomenon of suppressing criticism and resisting criticism. Various newspapers should conduct inspections and studies in connection with specific issues, and all past criticism manuscripts that have not been processed or have not been properly processed should be inspected and reprocessed.

　　IV. How to Strengthen the Work of the Editorial Department?

　　① Strengthen the leadership of newspaper work.

　　First of all, we must strengthen the work of the Party Newspaper Committee, and truly hold regular meetings every month to discuss the propaganda center and reporting plan of the newspaper, and check the implementation of the reporting plan for the previous month. Every Party Newspaper Committee member must adopt an active and responsible attitude, not only at meetings, but also at ordinary times, to reflect the situation to the newspaper and raise questions. Secondly, we must follow the instructions of the Northeast Bureau, and invite the president and editor-in-chief of the newspaper to attend the Party Committee meetings and read relevant important documents. The person in charge of the newspaper should also frequently and actively reflect the work situation to the person in charge of the Party Committee and listen to the specific instructions of the Party Committee.

　　② Strengthen the work of worker-peasant correspondents.

　　Since the work of worker-peasant correspondents is extremely important, appropriate forces must be allocated to carry out this work specifically. The editorial board should frequently study and check this work, and have a special person in charge; and truly regard leading the work of worker-peasant correspondents as their regular and important task. Especially in the early stage of development, we should pay more attention to strengthening the specific leadership of the work of worker-peasant correspondents.

　　③ Strengthen learning.

　　Running newspapers every day and learning every day is the task of our newspaper workers. If we do not learn, the newspaper will not be run well. When the work is urgent, the learning is also urgent. Many comrades have made particularly rapid progress in newspaper work for this reason. For example, after the propaganda center of each period is determined, we must specifically study how to publicize policies in connection with newspaper business, and pay attention to understanding and analyzing the important situations and problems in the specific implementation of policies. This close combination of learning and work makes it easy for people to improve. I hope that everyone will be good at stepping up learning from newspaper work; don't be afraid that newspaper work is prone to shortcomings and errors and be discouraged, but be good at improving yourself by overcoming shortcomings and errors. In addition to learning from the masses with great enthusiasm and strengthening investigation and research work, it is especially important that responsible cadres above the editorial board of each newspaper must take the time to study theory and strengthen their Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong Thought level; this is the basic key to further improving newspaper work.

### 在东北各省市报纸工作会议上的总结

　　在东北各省市报纸工作会议上的总结
    中共中央东北局宣传部部长  李卓然
    中共中央东北局宣传部于九月十五日至二十一日召开了东北各省市的报纸工作会议，出席会议的共有二十四个单位三十余位代表。这次会议讨论了三个问题：加强联系人民群众；进一步开展批评和自我批评；加强编辑部的工作。加强联系人民群众是这次会议讨论的中心问题。东北局宣传部长李卓然同志在会议的最后一天作了关于这三个问题的总结。其全文如下：
    一、这次会议的收获和缺点
    这次会议因为事前已有了较为充分的准备，各省市报纸都做了专门总结，东宣部又作了九个地方报纸的实际调查，并预先提出了将要讨论的问题，故会议时间虽只有四天，但主要的问题都讨论了。全国新闻工作会议以后，各报在执行“中共中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”和“新闻总署关于改进报纸工作的决定”中所获得的一些重要经验都交换了，使大家对贯彻中央所指示的方针，在认识上更为明确了，这就是会议的主要收获。讲到缺点方面，我觉得是对于在会议中所提出的一个重要问题；即群众性与指导性的关系问题，还未能展开深入的讨论。
    二、如何认识和加强省市报纸的群众性，是这次会议所讨论的中心问题。
    ①充分的群众性是人民报纸的基本特点。
    我们的报纸，都是群众性的报纸。从人民日报到东北日报、到各省市的报纸，在这一点上，都是相同的。我们的报纸，都应该是面向群众、反映群众、代表群众、教育群众；我们处理群众中的实际问题，是以最大多数人民的最大利益为出发点，是以代表这种最大利益的党的路线、政策为准绳，这就是我们报纸的群众性或群众观点的最高表现。在现阶段来说，中国人民政治协商会议的共同纲领就是全国人民最大利益的集中表现，我们每个报纸工作者必须认真学习这个纲领，来加强自己的群众观点和政策观点。
    ②不要孤立的来看群众性，不要把群众观点一般化或庸俗化。
    我们应当以什么观点和态度，来对待群众性的问题呢？应当是全面的、具体的，而不是片面的和抽象的来对待这一问题。比如说，干部和群众的关系问题，在一般意义上讲，共产党员或革命工作者都是人民群众中的一分子，或者说，是人民群众中最积极的分子；离开了群众，就不可能有干部。干部与群众是密切相联的，有些同志把干部与群众对立起来看，因而发生了“为干部办报还是为群众办报？”的问题。
    教育广大区村干部，具体指导他们工作，是省市报纸的重要任务。怎样来完成这一任务呢？显然是离不开群众的。应当根据群众的意见、要求和模范事迹来教育区村干部，这是提高他们的一个重要方面。比如说，群众对某些区村干部的强迫命令作风不满，我们的报纸就应当组织群众的批评与干部的自我批评，以求改进，这是在群众基础上提高报纸指导作用的重要方法。有的同志认为：干部需要与群众需要不同，要满足干部需要，就不能讲群众性；或者说，强调了群众性，就不能满足干部需要，这都是片面的或简单的看法。我们有些报纸还没有学会把指导性与群众性适当的结合起来，在报纸上一般道理讲的多，联系群众实际的宣传做的少，上面的东西堆的多，群众的生活和呼声反映的太少，这就是一般化的毛病；或者是不加分析的反映群众意见，把先进的或落后的意见混为一谈，把群众观点和政策观点对立起来看，这就是庸俗化的毛病。这两种做法或看法都是不对的，只有把指导性和群众性结合起来，把政策观点和群众观点统一起来，才是正确的全面的群众观点或群众性。
    ③报纸对象问题。
    省市报纸要不要规定主要读者对象？这不是要不要规定的问题，而是实际存在的问题；因为干部和群众的文化程度及其实际需要各有不同。报纸的主要读者对象不明确，就会犯一般化的毛病。过去各省市报纸凡是办得好的，都是因为它善于根据主要读者对象正确的解决了指导性与群众性的关系问题。过去规定省市报纸的主要读者对象为区村干部（或城市与企业中的下层干部）及有一定文化水平的群众，这并不是要大家不关心一般群众的问题。相反的，正是要根据这个主要读者对象的文化水平及其实际需要，来具体的关心和反映群众中的问题，以便帮助他们如何在群众中学习，又如何去领导或影响广大人民群众为实现党和政府在各个时期的每一个具体号召而斗争。所以，群众最关心的问题，也就是我们干部最关心的问题；如果群众最关心的问题，干部不关心，那就不是什么群众需要与干部需要有矛盾，而是干部脱离群众的问题了。比如目前反对美帝国主义侵略战争的时事问题，是广大群众和干部都很关心的问题，我们的报纸就应该很好的报道这个问题以便动员和组织人民来参加这个反美侵略的斗争。过去我们报纸上对时事宣传的注意很不够，这也是表现我们报纸群众性不够的一个方面。
    ④大力开展工农通讯工作，广泛建立读报组。
    各报的工农通讯工作，还没有真正的开展起来，这与我们过去的认识与强调不够有关，今后我们必须认真贯彻全国新闻会议的决定，放手的开展这一工作，使之真正成为各报编辑部的重要任务。
    报纸的群众性不是抽象的，要加强报纸的群众性，首先就必须广泛的开展工农通讯工作，真正使我们的报纸工作建立在广大群众积极分子参加办报的基础上，使群众乐于对我们的报纸负责，敢于提出问题和意见，这样的工农通讯员越多报纸就会办得越好。
    我们对工农通讯工作，一定要采取认真负责的态度，切实避免形式主义。通过我们艰苦的工作，使广大群众中的积极分子自觉自愿的参加办报。对工农通讯员的稿件，一定要慎重处理，总结过去经验，采取更多的办法密切和工农通讯员的联系。
    广泛建立读报组，也是报纸密切联系群众的重要方法。过去陕甘宁边区的《群众报》，很受群众的欢迎，那里的群众都用“咱们的报”来称呼它。除了读报组以外，农村中还有所谓“讲报”“传报”的积极分子，随时随地向群众传达报纸上的新闻。这说明办好报纸，是广泛建立读报组的决定条件；另一方面，广泛建立起读报组，会更加帮助我们把报纸办好。
    ⑤报纸的形式也要力求适合群众的需要。
    报纸的群众性基本上决定于报纸的内容，但是，如果表达的形式不适当，群众性也难于实现。这里最重要的是学习群众语言的问题，学习群众中那些富有思想的生动语言，是加强报纸群众性的重要条件。其他如报纸的编印技术及发行问题也应当力求改进，以适应读者的要求。
    三、开展批评与自我批评的问题
    ①加强批评的思想性。
    我们的批评应当是积极性的，不是简单的揭露、指责，而要仅可能地加以深刻的分析，充满说服教育的精神，使被批评者与广大读者都受到教育。
    批评与自我批评是经常任务，但并不是天天登就算完成了这一任务。主要的是要善于结合当前中心工作，抓住典型事例，采取实事求是和与人为善的态度，有头有尾的组织批评与自我批评，分析产生缺点或错误的原因，研究如何改正的办法，以达教育干部、群众和改进工作之目的。
    ②不要积压批评稿件。
    慎重对待批评与自我批评，是非常必要的。对没弄清楚或没有把握的批评稿件，经过调查研究再来发表或个别处理，也是对的。但是，这与故意拖延、或姑息错误却有根本区别。今后在处理批评稿件，特别是对于来自工农群众中的批评稿件，要建立严格的责任制，如有关机关认为某一问题需再经调查时，应当具体的规定需要多少时间，由谁负责调查，报社有责任按期督促，以及对不负责的现象提出批评。
    ③坚决克服压制批评和抗拒批评的现象。
    党中央发布决定以后，各报更加重视了开展批评与自我批评，因而加强了报纸的指导性。但是，压制批评和抗拒批评的现象在某些地方还很严重。为了更好的贯彻中共中央的决定，必须坚决克服这种压制批评与抗拒批评的现象。各报要联系具体问题进行检查和研究，对过去的批评稿件，凡是没有处理或处理不妥当的，都要加以检查和重新处理。
    四、如何加强编辑部工作？
    ①加强对报纸工作的领导。
    首先要加强党报委员会的工作，真正做到每月定期开会，讨论报纸的宣传中心和报道计划，检查上一个月报道计划的执行情况。每个党报委员，都要采取积极负责的态度，不仅在开会时，并且在平时，能向报社反映情况，提出问题。其次一定要遵照东北局的指示，吸收报社社长和总编辑列席党委会议，阅读有关的重要文件。报社负责人也要经常主动地向党委负责人反映工作情况，听取党委的具体指示。
    ②加强工农通讯工作。
    工农通讯工作既然是极其重要的工作，就要配备适当的力量来具体进行这一工作，编委会要经常研究、检查这一工作，并有专人负责；真正把领导工农通讯工作当成自己经常的重要任务。特别是在开展的初期，更要注意加强对工农通讯工作的具体领导。
    ③加强学习。
    天天办报，天天学习，这就是我们报纸工作者的任务。不学习则报纸就办不好，工作迫得紧，学习也迫得紧，许多同志在报纸工作中进步特别快，就是这个原因。比如每个时期的宣传中心确定后，就要联系报纸业务具体研究如何宣传政策，并注意了解和分析具体执行政策中的重要情况和问题。这种学习与工作的紧密结合容易使人长进，希望大家善于从报纸工作中加紧学习；不要害怕报纸工作容易发生缺点、错误而灰心，而要善于从克服缺点和错误中提高自己。除了十分热情的向群众学习，加强调查研究工作外，尤其重要的是各报编委以上的负责干部，一定要挤出时间研究理论，加强自己的马列主义理论和毛泽东思想水平；这是进一步提高报纸工作的基本关键。
