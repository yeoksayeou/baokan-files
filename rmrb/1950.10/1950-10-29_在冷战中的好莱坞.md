　　Hollywood in the Cold War
　　By David Pratt (Note) Translated by Luo Jingyu
　　Today, the most famous directors and writers in Hollywood are busy creating garbage-like stories and films; for their personal futures, they are constantly producing such waste.

　　Since Wall Street in New York and their spokesmen in Washington launched the "Cold War," Hollywood has begun to use murder, crime, racial discrimination, superstitious religion, anti-Sovietism, and so on as themes for their films.

　　Those who made progressive films in the 1930s, if they are still allowed to continue working today, have to make films that even they themselves feel ashamed of. If these works are not completely disgusting, they are nothing more than escapist nonsense.

　　In the past two years, John Ford has even made works full of reactionary content and superstitious deities like "The Fugitive" and "3 Godfathers." King Vidor directed "The Fountainhead," a film that is obviously propaganda for Fascism.

　　William Wellman directed "The Iron Curtain." Frank Capra lowered himself to making horse racing stories suitable for low tastes. William Dieterle and Fritz Lang had to make detective films.

　　The above people are all well-known filmmakers in Hollywood.

　　However, only in the years when Roosevelt implemented the New Deal and America's economic crisis was considerably improved, did artists like Capra complete well-known works with democratic significance such as "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" and "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town."

　　At the same time, John Ford completed two world-famous works, "The Informer" and "The Grapes of Wrath."

　　Fritz Lang produced the most powerful attack on anti-Semitism – "Fury," and the progressive work – "You Only Live Once." Wellman directed "Wild Boys of the Road," a film that promoted Roosevelt's policies and caused a national sensation in the United States. His last work, "The Ox-Bow Incident" – a film attacking anti-Semitism, depicts those who were wronged being proven innocent only minutes after being hanged.

　　Dieterle had completed a series of progressive works, such as "Pasteur," "The Life of Emile Zola," "Blockade," "Juarez," and so on. King Vidor produced stage adaptations of "Street Scene" and "The Citadel" – a film depicting a young doctor resisting ignorance and stubborn thinking.

　　Films like those listed above are now completely forbidden to be produced in Hollywood. Otto Preminger, who once directed the famous film "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang," publicly stated not long ago that he would never touch such a subject again. His reason is that Hollywood is being attacked and investigated from all sides, so it is best to make escapist entertainment films until the storm passes.

　　After the end of World War II, William Wyler made a very glorious film called "The Best Years of Our Lives." This film won film awards in several countries. But he himself recently said: "I am no longer allowed to make films of the same nature in Hollywood."

　　Hollywood is increasingly making films with surreal themes. This shows that the power and influence of the Catholic group in the American film industry is expanding day by day.

　　This influence puts pressure on producers and theater managers through the Legion of Decency. Its main purpose is to prevent the spread of democratic ideas on the screen and to uphold their anti-socialist and anti-scientific stubborn ideas.

　　Recently, this "Legion of Decency" recommended the war-mongering "The Red Menace" and "The Whip Hand" for children, believing that they were suitable for the needs of American children. This proves how much the American reactionaries contribute to the increase in "juvenile delinquency"!

　　Before World War II, this same Catholic group – the "Legion of Decency," inspected one hundred and twenty films produced by Nazi Germany in 1936 and 1937, and only six of them were considered to require partial trimming, while the rest were all passed and considered worth watching.

　　For the past ten years, this "Legion of Decency" has had a blacklist, recording the films they oppose. The films included in this blacklist include Chaplin's "Monsieur Verdoux," Wyler's "The Best Years of Our Lives," the French film "Carnival in Flanders," and so on.

　　In recent years, the number of films discriminating against race in the United States has greatly increased. For example, "Border Incident" is completely insulting to Mexicans. In this film, the "good guys" are only Mexican secret agents.

　　The same company that produced the reactionary film "The Iron Curtain" (20th Century Fox Film Corporation – translator's note), also produced a film called "House of Strangers." This film considers Americans and Italians marrying as a criminal act.

　　Films excluding black people continue to be produced from the "factory" of film art. Now, a banner is being raised: treating black people equally. But this is only superficially friendly to black people, and it is actually more poisonous than those films that openly exclude black people. Films like "Home of the Brave" and "Pinky" belong to this category. Its purpose is to disarm the black people's minds and stop the actual movement for liberation. Therefore, it superficially seems to be promoting the alliance of white and black people to fight for everyone's common interests, but in reality, it is not.

　　Regarding films excluding Native Americans, there is a concrete record in the history of Hollywood films. I don't know how many millions of American children have accepted this poison, believing that Native Americans are barbaric people who cut throats with knives, while the real American imperialists, who kill and set fires everywhere, are considered first-class good people.

　　No one can expect Hollywood to do anything good! Because Hollywood's main purpose is to expand its sphere of influence and make money. The main reason why Hollywood opposes progress is because it has a close internal relationship with America's sixty large families. And these sixty large families are controlling the entire lives of 140 million people in the United States.

　　Columbia Pictures is linked to the largest international banks in Europe and the Americas. Paramount Pictures is under the same controlled financial organization as Coca-Cola, electricity, oil, copper, rubber, railroads, automobiles, whiskey, and banks. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has joint investment relations with real estate companies and electric power companies. RKO Pictures is related to large investment organizations and brokerage groups. 20th Century Fox has more complex relationships, such as Pan American Airlines, American Trust Bank, National Distillers Products Corporation, as well as cigarettes and oil, are also operating together. Warner Bros. is under the control of a financial group with steel companies, automobile manufacturing companies, and electric power companies. Universal Pictures has extremely close ties with real estate companies.

　　The facts pointed out above explain why Hollywood's productions like "The Iron Curtain" promote anti-Sovietism. Because monopoly capital does not want world peace. This is exactly as the great Soviet writer Ehrenburg said, Hollywood movies are less of an art and more of a spreading plague germ. Because the United States has monopoly capital, there were blacklists and the imprisonment of ten progressive filmmakers in Hollywood.

　　Today in Hollywood, no one is allowed to make films that oppose the rich in content, let alone depict an ordinary American worker; otherwise, you will be labeled with a red hat and said to be a communist. You can't make a film saying that pursuing the dollar is wrong, and you can't deny that the dollar is all-powerful!

　　Now, the big capitalists in the United States have a new development plan, which decided to invade Korea, occupy Taiwan, and finally declare war on all colored people in Asia. These plans come from a group of people suffering from severe phobias; and they are facing the shattering of the illusion of a "world empire."

　　No matter how much the big capitalists in the United States try to seal the mouths of the American people, the American people are fighting back. Many movie audiences and the groups they form are beginning an unprecedented struggle against this Hollywood barbarian culture and anti-Soviet propaganda.

　　As a result of the American people's resistance, the film reporters hired by the capitalists have had to admit that these anti-peace and anti-progressive films are a complete failure in business.

　　Note: David Pratt is the Hollywood film reporter for the New York Daily Worker. This article is his speech at the Fifth International Film Festival in Czechoslovakia this year. This speech exposed what the so-called "democracy" and "freedom" in the United States are. The Truman reactionary government sentenced ten progressive directors and writers in Hollywood to imprisonment, which specifically illustrates the increasing fascism of American imperialism. In addition to openly reactionary films like "The Iron Curtain," Hollywood also has more sugar-coated and poisonous productions. The materials provided in this article are sufficient to show that American films are politically anti-people, anti-peace, promote aggressive war, and at the same time, they have no artistic value at all.

　　在冷战中的好莱坞
    大卫·卜拉蒂（注）作  罗静予译
    今天在好莱坞最有名的导演和作家，正忙着制造像垃圾样的故事和影片；为了他们个人的前程，他们不断地制造着这样的废物。
    自从纽约华尔街和他们在华盛顿的代言人发动“冷战”以来，好莱坞就开始拿杀人犯罪，种族歧视，迷信式的宗教，反苏等等作为他们制造影片的题材。
    在一九三○年代，曾经制作过进步影片的人，假如今天还容许他们继续工作，他们只好去制作令他们自己也觉得羞惭的影片。这些作品如果不是完全令人憎厌的，也不外乎是逃避现实的无稽之谈。
    在最近两年之中，约翰·福特竟然制出了《亡命者》和《三教父》那样充满反动内容和迷信神灵的作品。金维多导演了《水源》这样明显地是宣传法西斯主义的影片。
    威廉·魏尔曼导演了《铁幕》。弗兰克·卡布拉把身体降低到去制造适合低级趣味的赛马故事·威廉·戴德尔同弗锐慈·蓝也只好去制造侦探影片。
    以上这些人，都是好莱坞有名望的电影工作者。
    但是，在罗斯福实行新政，美国的经济危机得到相当改良的那些年代，才有像卡布拉这样的艺术家完成了《史密斯先生到华盛顿》和《狄慈先生到城里来》，这样一些含有民主意义的知名作品。
    在同一个时候，约翰·福特完成了《告密者》和《愤怒的葡萄》两部世界闻名的作品。
    弗锐慈·蓝制作了最有力的攻击排犹的作品——《愤怒》，和具有进步意义的作品——《你只活一次》。魏尔曼导演了《大路上的野孩子》，这部影片阐扬了罗斯福的政策，曾使美国全国轰动。他最后的一部作品《牛轭事件》——一部攻击排犹的作品，描写那些被冤枉了的人，在被吊死之后的几分钟，才证明了他们是无罪。
    戴德尔曾经完成了一系列的具有进步意义的作品，如像《巴士特》《左拉传》《封锁线》《魔舞》等等。金维多制作了舞台名著改编的《街景》和《堡垒》——一部描写一个年轻的医生，反抗愚昧顽固思想的影片。
    像以上所列举的那些影片，今天在好莱坞是一概不容许制作了。李弱哀曾经导演过那部有名的影片《我是一个亡命徒》。不久曾公开的说过，他今天决不再去接触这样题材的影片了。他的理由是因为好莱坞正被各方攻击调查，所以最好还是去制造专为逃避现实的消遣影片，直到这场暴风雨过去之后。
    在第二次世界大战结束之后，魏烈制作了一部十分光彩的影片，叫做《我们最好的时光》。这部影片在好几个国家获得电影奖。但是他本人最近却这样说：“我现在已经不容许在好莱坞制作同样性质的影片了。”
    好莱坞拿超现实为题材来制作影片，正在一天天地增加。这说明了天主教集团在美国电影界的势力和影响，正在一天天地扩大。
    这种影响是透过《道德会》（Legion of Decency）而加压力于制片人和影院的主持人。它主要的目的是要防止民主思想在银幕上的传播，而能坚持他们反社会主义化，反科学的顽固思想。
    最近这个“道德会”推荐了明明是挑拨战争的《赤祸》同《叛逆的罪恶》给儿童们看，认为是适合美国儿童的需要。这证明了美国的顽固派对增长“儿童犯罪”上有多么大的贡献！
    在第二次世界大战发生之前，这个同样的天主教团体——“道德会”，在一九三六年到一九三七年中检查了一百二十部纳粹德国出品的影片，仅仅其中有六部影片，认为应该有部分的修剪，其余的一概通过，认为值得一看。
    近十年来，这个“道德会”有一张黑名单，把他们反对的影片都记载上去。这张黑名单内包括的影片有卓别林的《凡尔度先生》，魏烈的《我们的最好时光》，法国出品的《弗兰达的狂欢节》等等。
    美国近年来歧视种族的影片，大大增加。如像《边境事件》完全是侮辱墨西哥人，在这部影片里的“好人”，只有墨西哥的特务分子。
    在制造了反动影片《铁幕》的同一家公司（廿世纪福斯影片公司——译注），更制造了一部影片，叫做《路人之家》。这部影片把美国人和意大利人结婚，认为是一种犯罪的行为。
    排斥黑人的影片，也继续不断地从电影艺术的“工厂”中产生。现在更打出一个旗号：对黑人平等看待。但这仅仅在表面上对黑人表示友好，实际上比那些明目张胆排斥黑人的影片，更有毒素。像《勇敢之家》、《品克》等，都是属于这一类影片。它的目的，是在想解除黑人的思想武装，停止争取解放的实际运动。所以表面上是像在提倡白种人和黑种人要联盟，好为大家的共同利益而奋斗，而实际不然。
    关于排斥印第安人的影片，早在好莱坞电影的历史上有过具体的记载。不知道有多少百万数的美国儿童，接受了这种毒素，相信印第安人是拿刀割喉咙的野蛮民族，而真正的美国帝国主义者，到处杀人放火，倒算是一等好人。
    谁也无法期望好莱坞能做出什么好事来！因为好莱坞主要的目的是为了扩大它的势力圈，想赚钱。好莱坞反对进步的主要原因，是因为它和美国的六十个大家族有着密切的内在关系。而这六十个大家族，在美国正控制着一亿四千万人民的一切生活。
    哥伦比亚公司是和欧美两洲最大的国际银行有着连系。派拉蒙公司是和可口可乐、电力、石油、铜、橡皮、铁道、汽车、威斯忌酒同银行，完全在同一个控制的金融组织下面。米高梅公司对房地产公司和电力公司有联合投资的关系。雷电华公司是和投资的大企业组织和经纪集团有关系。廿世纪福斯公司，有着更复杂的关系，像泛美航空公司，美国信托银行，国家制酒公司，还有香烟和石油，也是在一起经营，华纳兄弟公司是和钢铁公司，汽车制造公司，电力公司是在一个金融集团控制之下。环球公司是和地产公司有着极密切的关系。
    像上面所指出的事实，说明了为什么好莱坞的出品像《铁幕》一类的影片，要宣传反苏。因为垄断资本，决不愿世界和平。这正如伟大的苏联作家爱伦堡所说，好莱坞的电影与其说是一种艺术，不如说是蔓延的鼠疫菌。为了美国有垄断资本，所以才发生了黑名单和把好莱坞的十个进步电影工作者，关到监牢里去。
    今天在好莱坞，是不容许任何人，制造在内容上反对有钱人的影片，更不能描写一个普通的美国工人；否则，就替你带上一顶红帽子，说你是共产党。你也不能制作一部影片说追求美元是不对的，你更不能否定美元万能！
    现在美国的大资本家，又有了一个新的开发计划，这计划决定了要侵略朝鲜，占领台湾，最后向亚洲所有的有色人种宣战。这些计划，是来自一群害着严重恐惧病的人；而他们正面对着“世界帝国”的幻梦的破碎的时候。
    无论美国的大资本家，想用种种方法来封闭美国人民的口舌，美国人民，正在反攻回去。许多电影观众同他们组成的团体，正开始空前的斗争，反对这种好莱坞的野蛮文化同反苏宣传。
    由于美国人民反抗的结果，不得不使资本家雇用的电影记者承认这类反和平，反进步的影片，在营业上是完全惨败。
    注：大卫·卜拉蒂是纽约工人日报驻好莱坞的电影记者，这篇文章是他在今年捷克斯洛伐克举行的第五届国际电影节大会上的发言。这篇发言揭穿了美国的所谓“民主”和“自由”是什么东西。杜鲁门反动政府把好莱坞的十个进步导演和作家判处徒刑，就具体说明了美帝国主义的日趋于法西斯化。好莱坞除了《铁幕》之的公开的反动影片之外，还有更多的包着糖衣的含着毒素的出品。本文所提供的材料足以说明美国电影在政治上是反人民的，反和平的，宣传侵略战争的，同时它也决没有艺术价值可言。
