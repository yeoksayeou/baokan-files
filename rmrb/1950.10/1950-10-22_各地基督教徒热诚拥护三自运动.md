Christians in Various Places Enthusiastically Support the Three-Self Patriotic Movement

[Report from our newspaper] After the publication of the "Manifesto of the Chinese Christian Reform Movement," it quickly gained widespread support from Christians across the country. Excerpts of the reactions of Christians from various places to this manifesto are published below:

　　The "Ways for Chinese Christianity to Strive in the Construction of New China" is a valuable document, and colleagues in Kaifeng churches express their careful support and agreement.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Wang Shenyin, Henan Kaifeng Sheng Kung Hui)

　　I am a student in the Theology Department of Central China University. I was very moved when I saw the document "Ways for Chinese Christianity to Strive in the Construction of New China." We Christian youth in Wuhan have discussed this document and unanimously believe that this document is the key to the future of the entire Chinese church, so we completely agree with and support this matter.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Cheng Chugu, Theology Department, Central China University, Wuchang, Hubei)

　　The declaration "Ways for Chinese Christianity to Strive in the Construction of New China," published in the People's Daily on September 23, clarifies the overall mission and basic principles of Chinese Christianity, giving Chinese Christianity a new life. This is a declaration of great significance, and we should warmly welcome and support it.

　　Christianity has been introduced to China for more than 140 years. Imperialist countries, in order to seize colonies, used missionaries to invade China, and many facts can be found in history. Even now, judging from the spy cases that have been uncovered repeatedly in various places, imperialism is still trying to use the church as a cover for undermining the construction of New China. This kind of conspiracy is absolutely not allowed by kind Chinese Christians. We are Chinese, and we love our country. Therefore, we should support this church reform movement and actively participate in it. At the same time, I hope that Christians across the country will unanimously sign the appeal for the defense of world peace to show our determination to defend world peace. We firmly oppose the aggressive acts of American imperialism, which is inseparable from our patriotic movement.

　　Since liberation, in various practical life and studies, I have clearly realized that in the past, Christianity had an inseparable relationship with imperialism, which resulted in the semi-feudal and semi-colonial nature of Chinese Christianity, and in spirit, it emphasized ideals while ignoring reality. But these are not suitable in the new society, and they also violate the true meaning of Christianity. Therefore, the church must be reformed and implement the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-bureaucratic capitalist movement, as well as the self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation movement. I believe that the declaration "Ways for Chinese Christianity to Strive in the Construction of New China" is the only future for Christianity today. It is a completely correct and completely necessary declaration that combines the times and fulfills the Christian doctrine. Therefore, I express 100% agreement and guarantee to support this declaration with practical actions. I also hope that colleagues across the country can support this document with practical actions.

　　The Shaoguan Christian Association of Guangdong, including the Chinese Methodist Episcopal Church, Baptist Church, Chinese Lutheran Church, and Water Church, has been working hard to study and participate in the construction of New China since liberation. On June 4, all churches held a World Peace Public Prayer Service at the same time, launching a signature campaign to support the World Peace Declaration. On the same day, more than 400 believers signed. On August 24, a forum was held for the heads of Christian church groups in the city to oppose American imperialist aggression. Currently, the local churches are working as usual. We fully agree with the document "Ways for Chinese Christianity to Strive in the Construction of New China."
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Cai Enzhong, Shaoguan Christian Association, Guangdong)

　　I express my approval and extreme support for the document "Ways for Chinese Christianity to Strive in the Construction of New China." The overall mission, basic principles, and specific methods included in this declaration are extremely correct. All my colleagues and fellow believers should resolutely support this declaration and promote its realization.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Shu Ping, Peide Girls' Middle School, Sheng Kung Hui, Wuhu, Anhui)

　　The declaration issued by church colleagues is of great significance to the status and future of Christianity. After the liberation of Wuzhou, I continued to preside over the Wuzhou Christian Association. In the two sessions of the People's Congress of this city, I was also invited by the government to attend the meeting as a religious representative, which shows that the current People's Government is very thorough in connecting with all sectors of society and implementing the Common Program policy. The work of the churches in this city is also being carried out as usual. We are also able to cooperate with the government in various municipal works. I strongly support the declaration issued by Christians across the country this time.

### 各地基督教徒热诚拥护三自运动

　　各地基督教徒热诚拥护三自运动
    【本报讯】中国基督教革新运动宣言发表后，迅速获得全国各地基督教徒的普遍拥护。兹将各地教徒对这个宣言的反响摘要发表如下：
    《中国基督教在新中国建设中努力的途径》这个宝贵文件，开封各教会同仁对它表示悉心的拥护和赞成。
              （河南开封圣公会王神荫）
    我是华中大学神学组的一个学生，看到《中国基督教在新中国建设中努力的途径》文件，非常感动。我们在武汉的基督教青年，曾对此项文件展开讨论，一致认为这项文件是关系整个中国教会前途的枢纽，所以我们是完全同意并拥护这件事情的。
      （湖北武昌华中大学神学组程出谷）
    九月二十三日在人民日报上所发表的《中国基督教在新中国建设中努力的途径》的宣言，明确了中国基督教总的任务和基本方针，使中国基督教获得了新生命。这是具有伟大意义的宣言，我们应该热诚的欢迎它和拥护它。
    基督教传到中国已经有一百四十多年了。帝国主义国家为了侵占殖民地，他们利用传教侵入中国，在历史上可以找到很多事实；直到现在，从各地屡次被破获的间谍案情看来，帝国主义还一心想利用教会作为破坏新中国建设的掩护工具。这种阴谋诡计是善良的中国基督教徒们所绝不容许的。我们是中国人，我们爱自己的国家。因此我们应该支持这次发起的教会内部的革新运动，踊跃地参加这个运动。同时，希望全国基督教徒一致在保卫世界和平呼吁书上签名，表示我们保卫世界和平的决心。我们坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略行为，这和我们的爱国运动是分不开的。
        （河北省卢龙县师范学校高博林）
    解放以来，我在各种实际生活及学习中清楚的体会到过去基督教与帝国主义有分不开的关系，造成了中国基督教的半封建半殖民地性，在精神上偏重理想而忽视现实，但是这在新社会里都是不适合的，同时也是违反基督教的真正意义；所以教会必须改革，实行反帝、反封建、反官僚资本主义运动及自治、自养、自传运动。《中国基督教在新中国建设中努力的途径》这一宣言，我认为是今日基督教唯一的前途，是结合时代履行基督教教义的完全正确、完全必要的宣言，所以我表示百分之百的赞成，并保证以实际行动拥护这个宣言，同时也希望全国同道都能以实际行动来拥护这个文件。
            （汉口交通学院谷由石）
    广东韶关基督教联会，包括中华循道公会、浸信会、中华信义会、水上教会四个单位，自从解放后努力学习，参加新中国的建设。六月四日各教堂同时举行世界和平公祷礼拜，发动拥护世界和平宣言书签名运动，即日签名信徒共四百余名。八月二十四日曾召集市内基督教会团体负责人举行反美帝侵略座谈会。目前本地各教会照常工作，《中国基督教在新中国建设中努力的途径》文件，我们全部赞成。
          （广东韶关基督教联会蔡恩仲）
    我对于《中国基督教在新中国建设中努力的途径》这个文件表示赞成并极端拥护。这一篇宣言所包括的总的任务、基本方针及具体办法都是极正确的，凡我同工同道，都应当坚决拥护这个宣言，并促其实现。
      （安徽芜湖圣公会培德女中叔平）
    教会同道发表宣言，对于基督教地位及前途有重大意义。我于梧州解放后，照常主持梧州基联会务；本市两届人民代表会议，亦均蒙政府邀为宗教代表出席会议，可见今日人民政府对于连系各界，施行共同纲领政策，至为彻底。本市各教会工作亦均照常举办。在各项市政工作上亦均能与政府合作。此次全国基督教徒发表宣言，甚为拥护。
      （广西梧州基督教联合会梁元惠）
