　　MacArthur Intensifies Support for Japanese Zaibatsu
    Lifts Restrictions on Over a Hundred Companies
    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch] MacArthur, in order to intensify his support for the Japanese Zaibatsu, continues to openly lift restrictions on Japanese Zaibatsu companies. According to a Kyodo News Agency dispatch from Tokyo: MacArthur Headquarters announced on the 16th that over fifty enterprise companies which were related to the Zaibatsu before and during the war and were included on the restricted list have recently had their restrictions lifted. Their business scopes include coal mines, shipping, metals, steel pipes, cement, chemicals, etc. Up to now, as a result of MacArthur repeatedly writing off companies from the restricted list of one thousand two hundred and three Zaibatsu companies, only four hundred and sixty-three remain. And these companies can also have their restrictions lifted as long as they complete the procedure of "selling shares."
    At the same time, MacArthur Headquarters announced again on the 18th that restrictions were being lifted on one hundred and twenty-seven Japanese companies that were active overseas during the war. They were previously distributed in China, Korea, Sakhalin, Thailand, Hong Kong, and other parts of the Far East.

    又解除对百余家公司的限制
    【新华社讯】麦克阿瑟为加紧扶植日本财阀，继续公开解除对日本财阀公司的限制。据共同社东京讯：麦克阿瑟总部十六日宣布，因战前及战时与财阀有关而被列入限制名单的企业公司五十余家，最近已被解除限制。它们经营的范围包括煤矿、海运、金属、钢管、水泥、化学等。至此，限制名单上的一千二百零三家财阀公司，被麦克阿瑟一再勾销的结果，现在仅剩四百六十三家。而这些公司也只要办清“出卖股票”的手续，即可解除限制。
    与此同时，麦克阿瑟总部又于十八日宣布，对日本战时在海外活动的公司一百二十七家解除限制。它们以前分布在中国、朝鲜、库页岛、泰国、香港及远东其他各地。
