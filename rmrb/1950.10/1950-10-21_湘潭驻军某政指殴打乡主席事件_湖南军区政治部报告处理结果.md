    Report on the Handling of the Incident of a Political Instructor of a Certain PLA Unit Stationed in Xiangtan Beating a Township Chairman; Hunan Military Region Political Department
    To the Editor:
    After the letter "Political Instructor of a Certain PLA Unit Stationed in Xiangtan Beats Township Chairman" was published in the People's Forum on September 23, we immediately sent personnel to Zhuzhou to investigate, and on October 6, we held a joint meeting (attended by representatives from the government, military units, and factories) to clarify the facts and define responsibilities.
    Military Liaison Officer Wang Xicai (mistakenly referred to as a military representative in the original letter) did not handle the quarrel between Weng Hansheng and the guard in a timely manner, leading to the escalation of the incident. He was well acquainted with Weng Hansheng, and when Weng was being tied up and sent away, Weng asked Wang to prove that he was a good person, but Wang remained silent and did not stop it. Therefore, he should bear considerable responsibility for this matter.
    The squad leader of the third squad should also be held responsible for making incorrect reports to his superiors without clarifying the issue.
    Instructor Zhu did not investigate the situation and issued orders over the phone casually, illegally infringing on human rights, causing dissatisfaction among the masses, and causing political and work losses, and should bear legal responsibility.
    Township Chairman Weng Hansheng's spirit of taking responsibility for the people by actively consulting with the factory to resolve the problem should be commended.
    We have taken the following measures to deal with this matter: Convene a mass meeting on a regular basis to explain the facts, apologize to the masses, and improve the relationship between the military and the people. In addition to ordering Wang and Zhu to make self-criticisms and apologize to the masses at the meeting, the factory will also give Wang Xicai a demotion as a punishment and transfer him back to the factory for reflection and reform; Instructor Zhu and others will be transferred back by the Railway Command for severe punishment. The squad leader of the third squad should also be given appropriate punishment. The newly transferred Instructor Zhang said: "The People's Liberation Army does not beat good people. If Chairman Weng is making trouble in the factory, it wouldn't matter if he was shot." This attitude is wrong and should be strictly criticized.
    At the same time, in order to improve relations in all aspects, on October 7, the factory convened a joint meeting of government, military, factory, and township cadres (and invited Township Chairman Weng Hansheng to attend). The military unit is responsible for compensating Township Chairman Weng Hansheng for his medical expenses and damaged clothing.

    湘潭驻军某政指殴打乡主席事件
    湖南军区政治部报告处理结果编辑同志：
    九月二十三日人民园地发表“湘潭驻军某政指殴打乡主席”一信后，我们当即派员前往株州调查，并于十月六日召开了联席会议（参加的有政府、部队、工厂的代表），弄清了是非，明确了责任。
    军事联络员王喜才同志（原信误为军事代表）对翁汉生与卫士口角争执事，不及时处理，致使事态扩大。他与翁汉生很熟识，当捆送翁时，翁要求王证明他是好人，但王一声不吭，且不加制止。故对此事他应负相当责任。
    三班班长，不将问题弄清楚，就向上级做了不正确的反映，也应该负责任。
    朱指导员不调查情况，随便在电话里面下命令，非法侵犯人权，引起群众不满，造成政治上工作上的损失，应负法律上的责任。
    乡主席翁汉生能主动向厂方商量解决问题，这种为人民负责的精神应予表扬。
    我们对此事作了如下的处理：定期召开群众大会，说明事实经过，向群众道歉，搞好部队与群众的关系。除令王、朱在大会上向群众作检讨并道歉外，并由厂方给王喜才以撤职处分，调回厂内反省改造；朱指导员等则由铁道司令部调回，给以严厉处分。三班班长也应给以适当处分。新调来的张指导员说：“解放军不打好人，翁主席在工厂捣乱，枪毙了也没啥事。”这种态度是错误的，应予严格批评。
    同时，为了搞好各方面的关系，十月七日由厂方召开了政府、部队、工厂、乡干部的联席会议（并邀请乡主席翁汉生参加）。乡主席翁汉生的医药等费用及损坏的衣服，均由该部队负责赔偿。
