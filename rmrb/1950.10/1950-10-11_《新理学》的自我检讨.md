　　Self-Criticism of "New Rational Philosophy"
    Feng Youlan
    In my "Summary of One Year of Study," I once said: "My past philosophical thinking hindered my own progress and hindered the progress of some others." After this article was published, I received letters from friends in various places, confirming that my past philosophical thinking did indeed hinder the progress of some people.

    One of these friends, whom I had never met, is Mr. Mao Mingjia. His letter reads: "The reason I wanted to communicate with you is because I once had a historical connection with you. Because I was once enthusiastic about your 'New Rational Philosophy,' to the point that all my thoughts, words, and actions were influenced by you... I have done some self-criticism, and I have done it very strictly. I have examined my past, and I have examined it very carefully. In the process of examination and criticism, I also examined 'New Rational Philosophy' and you, and I criticized your past. Therefore, in many ways, I see your transformation as my transformation, and your reform as my reform."

    Mr. Mao's letter moved me deeply. However, I did not have the opportunity to discuss in detail the three points he raised regarding "New Rational Philosophy." Firstly, because my recent attention has been focused on studying new philosophy, I feel a sense of weariness when discussing old philosophical issues. Secondly, the three points raised by Mr. Mao were errors that arose from the general influence of "New Rational Philosophy." Specifically, those three points have considerable discrepancies with the statements of "New Rational Philosophy." A detailed discussion would not be something that could be completed in just a few words.

    Now, the three points raised by Mr. Mao have been published in the newspaper (see Guangming Daily, August 6th). It seems that I should write an article discussing these points, but the two difficulties mentioned above still exist. I think that instead of discussing the details point by point, it would be more beneficial to make a general review of "New Rational Philosophy."

    Since the May Fourth Movement, I have been very attentive to the so-called problem of Chinese and Western culture at that time. I have always believed that the difference between Chinese and Western culture is due to the difference between Chinese and Western philosophy. In 1933, I lived in England for half a year and read some books on Communism. Historical materialism helped me solve the problem of Chinese and Western culture. The book "New Theory of Things" that I wrote during the Anti-Japanese War was the crystallization of my thinking during this period. Looking at it now, my understanding of historical materialism at that time was very inadequate. But since 1933, I have always believed that Marx and Engels' historical materialism is correct. However, until before liberation, I always believed that I could hold materialism in historical research, but not necessarily in ontology.

    Even so, my "New Rational Philosophy" was initially influenced, or rather inspired, by my understanding of historical materialism. Previously, like many people, when talking about cultural issues, I distinguished cultures based on national or ethnic distinctions. Historical materialism, on the other hand, distinguishes cultures based on the stages of social development. From the perspective of historical materialism, all countries or nations that belong to a certain stage of social development are of the same type in terms of culture. That is to say, when making judgments about all their cultures, using them as the subject, they can be described with the same predicate. For example, the culture of the United States is a bourgeois culture; the culture of England is a bourgeois culture. In these two propositions, British culture and American culture are "particular," and bourgeois culture is "general." In these propositions, we see the opposition and unity of the particular and the general.

    Extending from the judgment of the cultures of different countries to the most common judgment of the most common things. For example, we say: this table is square; this table is "particular," and square is "general." In this proposition, we also see the opposition and unity of the particular and the general. That is how the book "New Rational Philosophy" began. This kind of analysis is not wrong. However, in the book "New Rational Philosophy," what I emphasized was not the unity of the general and the particular, but their opposition. On the one hand, they are opposed, but emphasizing only their opposition commits the error of "linearity and one-sidedness" that Lenin spoke of. Lenin said in "On the Question of Dialectics": "Linearity and one-sidedness, rigidity and inflexibility, subjectivism and subjective blindness are the epistemological roots of idealism."

    Human knowledge is a reflection of objective things. There are two aspects of objective things: in one aspect, we can see the particular; in another aspect, we can see the general. Not knowing that these two aspects can be viewed separately means that knowledge lacks analysis of things, which is the original unity in knowledge, or it can be said to be chaos. After analysis, knowing that things have these two aspects, but at the same time needing to know that these two aspects are inseparable in objective things. A concrete thing is the unity of the opposition of the two aspects. This in knowledge is going back to unity after analysis. This is the advancement of knowledge. This is the dialectical development of knowledge.

    But knowledge may very well remain at the stage of analysis. The theory that comes from this emphasizes the opposition of the particular and the general and ignores their unity in objective things. The theory in the book "New Rational Philosophy" is a theory that remains at this stage of knowledge.

    Because of this emphasis, before liberation, the Hegelian philosophical term that I least understood was "concrete universal" (that is, a special general). In my previous view, these were two contradictory terms. Now my view is: when viewed as nouns, these are two contradictory terms. But in fact, everything is a concrete universal. Understanding what kind of concrete universal it is allows us to know how to deal with it.

    Understanding the concrete universal was a major gain for me in participating in land reform. In land reform, a major task was to classify components. Every person has a class component; he is a rich peasant, or a poor peasant, or a self-employed person. Whatever component he has, he receives whatever treatment. Every person is not just Zhang San or Li Si, but a rich peasant or a poor peasant, etc. From this aspect, he is a real universal. The real universal is the individual. Therefore, it is not empty or abstract, but has flesh and blood. It is a concrete universal.

    We now oppose the United States; we are not opposing the United States, but opposing an imperialist. We are not opposing an empty, abstract, general imperialist, but the American imperialist. The United States is an imperialist. The United States is particular, and imperialist is general. Besides the United States, there are many other imperialists. Every imperialist is not exactly the same as the United States, but they are all imperialists. That is to say, the content of every concrete imperialist is richer than the content of the abstract imperialist. The American imperialist is a concrete universal, a special general. Knowing that the United States is an imperialist is much better than just knowing that the United States is the United States, because if you know it is an imperialist, you know how to deal with it. Understanding imperialism from the American imperialist is also much better than understanding imperialism solely from the definition of "imperialist," because the definition is abstract, and a concrete imperialist is richer in content than an abstract definition.

    My thought stagnated at this stage of analysis, which is related to my attitude towards studying philosophy. I used to think that the philosopher's task was to observe the world. Shao Yong of the Song Dynasty wrote a book called "Guan Wu Pian" (Observing Things). I used to like the words "Guan Wu" (observing things) very much. Cheng Hao had a poem that said, "Quietly observing all things, one will naturally gain understanding." I used to like the words "quietly observing" very much. I used to think that the philosopher's task was to "quietly observe" all things and analyze them in his own mind. The philosopher is a bystander of the universe. This attitude is completely opposite to the attitude of the philosopher of the new philosophy. The task of the new rational philosophy is not only to explain the world, but also to transform the world. Practice is not opposed to knowledge, but is part of knowledge. In the new philosophy, theory must be united with practice. So the new philosophy cannot remain at the stage of analysis. It not only focuses on the opposition of the general and the particular in thought, but also focuses on their unity in practice.

    Before liberation, I already disliked the term "idealism." I thought my philosophical thinking was not "idealism." I "thought" this for two reasons. First, my philosophical thinking acknowledges the existence of an external world independent of the mind. Second, my philosophical thinking does not recognize the mind as the essence or source of the universe. I admit that the mind must have its material basis in order to exist. On the first point, my philosophical thinking is not what is called subjective idealism in old philosophy. On the second point, my philosophical thinking is also not what is called objective idealism in old philosophy. With these two reasons, I have never admitted that my philosophical thinking is "idealistic."

    Recently, I discovered that because I emphasized the opposition of the particular and the general, this excessive emphasis later evolved into the general being able to break away from matter and nature and exist independently. This is also a kind of idealism. In one aspect, I avoided idealism; but in another aspect, I fell into the trap of idealism.

    I used to think that the method of "New Rational Philosophy" was to make a formal analysis of things. I used to like the three words "formal" very much. This comes from formal logic. When formal logic discusses the connection of concepts, it does not care about the content of the concepts and inferences, but only cares about the formal relationship between them. The so-called formal analysis in "New Rational Philosophy" also does not care about the concrete nature of things, but only makes a formal affirmation of things. It believes that things must all be some kind of thing, and that if there is some kind of thing, there must be what makes that thing that kind of thing. What makes something that kind of thing, "New Rational Philosophy" calls reason or commonality (that is, the general). In this way, it only affirms that there is reason, and does not need to know the content of reason. It believes that knowing the content of reason is the task of science, not the task of philosophy.

    But such a philosophy is empty. I used to admit that it was empty. And I thought the emptier the philosophy, the better. The emptier it is, the purer it is. But what is the use of such a philosophy? My previous answer was: the use of this philosophy is not to increase people's knowledge, but to raise people's "realm."

    The statement about the realm of people that I put forward in the book "New Origin of Man." Looking at it now, that kind of statement and way of saying it is harmful. But the main meaning of it, I still feel, represents the fine tradition of old Chinese philosophy, and it is still useful in the new society. I feel that the new society provides that meaning with more examples. In the new society, some things, in form, seem to be no different from some things in the old society. For example, the socialist competition in factories, in form, seems to be the same as the way capitalist factories deceive workers into producing more labor. But enlightened people know that although these two are somewhat similar in form, their meaning is completely different. "Red Flag Song" uses dramatic methods to explain the difference between them and to explain that people who are aware of this difference not only have a new meaning in their work, but also have a new meaning in their lives. In the new society, everything has a new meaning, so people's lives also have a new meaning, and this new meaning constitutes a new realm for people.

    In the new society, moral standards have been raised. In fact, it is to raise the realm of every person to the "moral realm." This is a very great progress in the new society. Some people think that Communism only advocates "struggle" and does not advocate "cooperation," so it advocates selfishness. Others think that Communism focuses on "materialism," so it only focuses on material enjoyment and does not focus on spiritual improvement. These arguments, if not out of deliberate slander, are out of complete ignorance.

    As I now realize, the statement about the "realm of heaven and earth" in the book "New Origin of the Way" is problematic. If we say that a person should have his own worldview. He should not only understand society, but also understand the universe. With an understanding of the universe, his actions have a different meaning for him. For example, one person understands that labor creates mankind and labor creates the world. Another person understands that labor can increase social production. Another person understands that labor can get rewards from superiors. These three people have different understandings of labor, and when they go to work, the meaning of labor is different, and their realms are also different. According to the statement of "New Origin of Man," a person who understands that labor has the meaning of creating the world, and goes to work with this meaning, in such labor, his realm is the realm of heaven and earth. Such a statement does not seem to be harmful.

    However, the so-called realm of heaven and earth is very likely to become a source of monastic escapism. For people who do not have the courage to fight for social justice, who cannot raise themselves to the moral realm, they will hide in what they think is the realm of heaven and earth. According to the theory of "New Origin of Man," this is impossible. Because such an escape comes from selfishness, the realm of the person who makes such an escape is actually the "utilitarian realm." Although I do not approve of escape in theory, I am always escaping in action. "New Origin of Man" may also have this kind of influence on others. This kind of influence is harmful.

    However, raising people's realm does not necessarily depend on what I call empty philosophy. In the past, I thought that raising the realm was needed by everyone, while the so-called "technical" philosophy, that is, tedious philosophy, was not needed by everyone (as I see it now, it is not needed by anyone). So I deliberately simplified philosophy to a few concepts. These few concepts can raise people's realm. This is the main meaning of the book "New Knowledge and Speech." But now, these empty concepts have lost contact with reality. The realm that it can raise is probably the escapism mentioned above. In fact, principles like labor creating mankind and labor creating the world, which are related to reality, can also raise people's realm. And they can raise people's realm in practical work.

    In the book "New Origin of the Way," I pointed out that in Chinese philosophy, there is an opposition between two tendencies; the development of Chinese philosophy tends to unite this opposition. This way of speaking has the meaning of dialectics. An Englishman read this book and asked, "Is Feng someone a Communist?" Of course, this question proves that he does not understand Communism. That book pointed out the development of Chinese philosophy from a dialectical point of view, but not from a materialistic point of view. What is hidden in the opposition of those two tendencies is actually the opposition and contradiction between idealism and materialism. I should reveal this hidden essence and explain the mission of dialectical materialism. Dialectical materialism, on the one hand, wages a "two-line struggle" against past idealism and mechanical materialism, and on the other hand, unites their advantages. This is its historical mission of "inheriting the past and opening up the future." This historical mission has long been brewing in history, and its beginnings can also be seen in the development of Chinese philosophy.

    I said that the statement about the realm of people put forward in "New Origin of Man" is harmful. Because it is based on the individual and starts from the individual. The book "New Teachings for the World," which talks about methods of self-cultivation, is also based on the individual and starts from the individual. As for the new philosophy, no matter what it talks about, it is based on the masses and starts from the masses. This is a major dividing point between old philosophy and new philosophy. According to the old Chinese philosophy, a person who is not willing to be mediocre wants to hope to become a sage, that is to say, wants to make himself a sage. The Song Confucians believed that a person who becomes a sage is not a person who is separated from society. He wants to improve himself and complete himself in social activities. Compared with the Buddhist school, this is a step forward, but he still always bases himself on the individual and starts from the individual.

    In the new philosophy, everything starts from the masses. "Serving the people" is the moral requirement for everyone. Not only "serving the people," but also "wholeheartedly" serving the people. That is to say, serving the people cannot have the slightest motive of selfishness. The new society also requires everyone to use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to review at any time whether he is really serving the people wholeheartedly. This starting point is different. It is not because one wants to make oneself a sage that one serves the people, but one must serve the people, so one must first completely forget oneself.

    Wang Yangming explained the three outlines of the "Great Learning," taking loving the people as the effort of manifesting virtue. He said: "Manifesting virtue must be in loving the people, and loving the people is the way to manifest virtue." The new philosophy's requirements for people in terms of morality are exactly the opposite. Borrowing old terms, it takes manifesting virtue as the effort of loving the people. This turns the entire Song and Ming Neo-Confucianism upside down, just as Marx turned Hegel upside down.

    In class society, the system of private property makes everyone have a habit, that is, to think of oneself first in everything. The philosophy of the proletariat is the philosophy of the proletarian society. In this society, there is no private property, so there is no individualism. A person not only does not want to make himself a rich or noble person, but also does not want to make himself a sage. But he wants to serve the people, and he must completely forget himself. Completely forgetting oneself is the main component of what used to be called a sage. But the method of becoming a sage as taught in the past cannot really make people become sages. Because if a person is always thinking about making himself a sage, he is still always thinking about himself. Always thinking about himself means that he cannot forget himself. The Song and Ming Neo-Confucians often thought that the Buddhist people wanted to make themselves Buddhas, which was selfish. As I see it now, what is wrong with the Neo-Confucians wanting to make themselves sages?

    In the book "New Teachings for the World," I have an article discussing the problem of emotions. For this problem, although I do not advocate the method of "transforming emotions with reason" as said by Taoist philosophy, I advocate the theory of the Song Confucians that "emotions follow all things and have no emotions." This theory does not need to be discussed in detail now, but one thing that can be said is that the actual effect of this theory is to dilute emotions. It cannot become the driving force of behavior, but is only a harmless appendage of behavior. This kind of theory is reflected in my attitude and speech. An article in Guangming Daily said that I have an unusual calmness. There is also a Tsinghua classmate who is now working in the countryside who said in a letter to me: "There have been two kinds of languages that have grasped me. One is the 'New Rational Philosophy' style, and the other is the peasant style. But the former makes me calm, to the point of coldness, and I am intoxicated. The latter excites me to the point of tears and wanting to fight." Of course, the difference between calmness and coldness is very limited.

    After contacting people on the side of the revolutionary ranks, I felt that whether it was their actions or their words, they were full of enthusiasm. I think there is probably this kind of situation regarding the development of the revolution. In the early days of the revolution, revolutionaries mostly relied on naive, spontaneous enthusiasm and lacked rational organization and planning. The Xinhai Revolution and the May Fourth Movement that I have seen both have this situation. Now the revolution has a complete set of theories and plans, and it is also driven by the highest enthusiasm. In revolutionary action, reason leads emotion, just as the leader leads the masses. Such a life of unity between reason and emotion is the real rich life. I used to think that my method was also to achieve the unity of reason and emotion, but according to that method, emotion cannot play a positive role in reality. So that method is still biased towards eliminating emotion. This is the bias of monasticism.

    In summary, I have recently discovered that my previous philosophical thinking does not conform to the fundamental point of dialectical materialism, which is that the spirit and method of dialectical materialism focuses on the opposition and unity of opposition in things, while the spirit and method of my previous philosophical thinking focuses on the opposition of the opposition in things. Therefore, when combined with practice, the spirit and method of dialectical materialism achieves unity everywhere: unity of theory and practice, unity of individual and masses, unity of reason and emotion. The spirit and method of my previous philosophical thinking achieves disconnection everywhere: disconnection of theory and practice, disconnection of individual and masses, disconnection of reason and emotion.

    I have some corrections and supplements to Mr. Mao's evaluation of "New Rational Philosophy."

    First, some people think that I advocate restoring the old and reversing the car. I don't think this is entirely in line with the facts. My "New Theory of Things," as it looks now, has many shortcomings, but it cannot be said to advocate restoring the old or reversing the car. I also do not believe that a new society can come about without revolutionary bloodshed. But I am afraid of bloodshed. I am afraid of my own bloodshed, and I am also afraid of other people's bloodshed. "New Rational Philosophy" begins with expounding "rational philosophy," but later the flavor of Taoism and Zen Buddhism becomes stronger and stronger. It is indeed "representing the disappointment and pessimism of old intellectuals in the current society, and yet lacking the power to seek reform," as Mr. Mao said.

    Second, Mr. Mao said that "New Rational Philosophy" is the philosophy of the oppressed class. This is probably his polite remark. In the past, I thought that I was super-class, and my philosophical thinking was also super-class, and it could be used in any class of society. Recently, I realized that this idea of ​​being super-class is itself the idea of ​​the ruling class. Of course, the so-called ruling class has many classes. Like the vast majority of philosophers in the past, I belong to the so-called scholar-bureaucrat class. In the old society, it was "not good enough to be above, but more than enough to be below." In the past, I had a considerable liking for the new philosophy. It almost attracted me to the revolutionary side. But I was afraid of changing my "normal" life. This "normal" life is of course the life of the general scholar-bureaucrat in the old society. This life determined that my thinking would drill into the horns and circle around in traditional philosophy.

    The Anti-Japanese War inspired my nationalistic emotions. This emotion made my philosophical thinking manifest itself in the way of summarizing old philosophy. I have recently felt that there are two ways to summarize old philosophy: one is to make a critical general critique of previous philosophical thinking; the other is to make a sympathetic general understanding of previous philosophical thinking. What I did before was the latter kind of summary. On the eve of the collapse of the old society, I wanted to make a "sympathetic" understanding of previous thoughts. In terms of objective effect, isn't it equal to wanting to save its collapse? And saving the collapse of the old society was exactly what the ruling class at that time needed. I have recently felt that the same sentence, said at different times, said to different people, and said in different ways, will have different social effects. I didn't notice this point before.

    Mr. Mao said: Before liberation, "New Rational Philosophy" was once a pillar of thought. If it really was a pillar, that is the problem. No matter what I think subjectively, in terms of objective influence, this pillar is a pillar of the old society. When the old society is the object of revolution, this pillar of thought will of course also become the object of revolution.

    There is such a situation in the objective aspect. In the subjective aspect, there is what a classmate said in his letter to me. He said: "My teacher has been 'king' for too long in traditional Chinese philosophy, and the harm is really great. Now we must always sound the alarm. It is absolutely necessary for individuals to make discoveries, and the spirit of hard work must be promoted even more. But it is never allowed to 'claim oneself as an orphan and widow,' and this idea and its related emotions are not allowed... As you yourself said on this point: 'You must work hard to overcome it.'"

    Third, Mr. Mao said: The popularity of New Rational Philosophy was a tragedy. From one aspect, it can be said that way. In the past, I did not have class views, but I did have national views. As mentioned above, in the Anti-Japanese War, nationalism gave me great inspiration. I intentionally promoted what I thought was the fine tradition of national thought, thinking that this was beneficial to the nation. But later, the development of the revolution made my work an obstacle to the revolution and also an obstacle to the interests of the nation. From this aspect, it can be said to be a tragedy.

    If viewed from other aspects, it is not a tragedy. Modern Chinese history has changed too drastically and too quickly. Often a period of time, in terms of time, is only a few years, but in terms of content, it can be equivalent to a very long era in ordinary history. "New Rational Philosophy" had its progressiveness in the beginning. I do not believe that something completely without progressiveness can have considerable popularity at a certain time. As far as "New Rational Philosophy" is concerned, it opposed the then experimentalism of agnosticism. It opposed the then intuitionism of irrationalism. It advocated logical analysis and clear thinking. It tried to solve the problem of Chinese culture from the point of view of historical materialism. Its nationalistic color played a considerable role in promoting the anti-Japanese war in some aspects. But China changed too quickly. Soon it lost its progressiveness and became an obstacle to progress, "cleared by history." This is "the inevitable trend," and there is nothing to be tragic about.

    For those of us who are accustomed to the old philosophy, the transformation of society is our good fortune. The establishment of the new philosophy has a history of one hundred years, but we have either dabbled in it or turned a blind eye to it. Only the change of the whole society has made us begin to understand the truth of the new philosophy. This is equivalent to the change of the whole society as a scientific experiment for us. Isn't it a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us to encounter such a great experimental scene?

    People who are born in the new society, looking back at the living habits and thoughts and feelings in the old society, are like people who are traveling in the mountains, standing on a higher peak; looking back at what they thought was the highest peak before, it is already under their feet, and its whole picture, which they could not see before, is now clear, and its shortcomings, which were not obvious before, are now obvious. In this situation, it is really very fortunate for people to know their previous prejudices and mistakes.

　　《新理学》的自我检讨
    冯友兰
    在我的“一年学习总结”中，我曾经说：“我过去的哲学思想，阻碍了我自己的进步，并阻碍了有些别人的进步”；这篇文章发表之后，接了些各地方朋友的来信，证实了，我过去的哲学思想，确曾阻碍了有些人的进步。
    其中有一位未曾见过面的朋友，就是茅冥家先生。他的信上写：“我之想与你通信，是因为我曾经与你有过一段历史渊源。因为我曾经热中于你的“新理学”，至于一切思想，言论，行动，都受你的影响……我做过一番自我批评而且做得很严格。我检查我的过去而且检查得很仔细。在检查与批评中，我连带检查到了《新理学》与你，也批评了你的过去。因此有许多地方，我对于你的转变，看成了我的转变；对于你改造，看成我的改造。”
    茅先生的信使我很受感动。不过对于他所提的关于《新理学》的三点，我没来得及很详细地讨论。一则因为我近来的注意力，集中在学习新哲学。对于以前旧哲学的问题的讨论，很有厌倦之感。再则茅先生所提的那三点，是他受《新理学》的一般影响而发生的错误。专就那三点说，与《新理学》的说法，还有相当的出入。若仔细讨论起来，并非三言两语，所能完结。
    现在茅先生所提的那三点，已在报上发表了（见八月六日光明日报）。我似乎应该对于那几点写一篇讨论的文章，但是上面所说的那两点困难，仍然存在。我想，与其枝枝节节的讨论，倒不如就《新理学》作一个一般的检讨，或者对于自己有更大的益处。
    自从五四运动后，我很留意当时所谓中西文化问题。我一直认为，中西文化的不同，是由于中西哲学的不同。一九三三年，我在英国住了半年，看了一些共产主义的书。历史唯物论帮助我解决了中西文化问题。在抗战时期，我所写的新事论，那本书，就是这时期的思想的结晶。照现在看起来，当时对于历史唯物论的了解，是很不够的。但是自从一九三三年起，我一直相信马恩的历史唯物论是正确的。不过一直到解放前，我一直相信我可以在历史研究方面持唯物论。而在本体论方面不必持唯物论。
    虽然如此，我的《新理学》，在开始却是受我所了解的历史唯物论的影响，或者可以说是启示。以前我像很多人一样，于谈到文化问题时，分别文化，都是以国别或民族为标准的，而历史唯物论分别文化，则是以社会发展的阶段为标准的。从历史唯物论的观点看，凡国家或民族，属于社会发展的某一阶段的，它们在文化上是一类的，这就是说，如对于它们所有的文化作判断，以它们为主词，可以同一的客词形容它们。例如说，美国的文化是资产阶级的文化；英国的文化是资产阶级的文化，在这两命题中，英国文化及美国文化是“个别”。资产阶级的文化是“一般”。在这些命题中，我们看见个别与一般的对立与统一。
    从对于各国别的文化的判断，推广到对于最普通事物的最普通的判断。例如我们说：这个桌子是方的；这个桌子是“个别”，方的是“一般”。在这个命题中，我们也看见个别与一般的对立与统一。新理学那本书，就是这样开始的。这样的分析是不错的。不过在新理学那本书中，我所注重的，不是一般与个别的统一，而是它们的对立。在一方面说，它们是对立的，不过专强调它们的对立，这就犯了列宁所说的“直线性与片面性”的错误。列宁在“谈辩证法问题”一文里说：“直线性与片面性，死板与僵化，主观主义与主观盲目病，这就是唯心主义的认识论上的根源。”
    人的知识，是客观事物的反映，客观事物中有两方面：在一方面中可以看到个别，在又一方面中可以看到一般。不知道此两方面可以分别观之，这是知识对于事物没有分析，这是知识上的原始统一，也可说就是混沌。经过分析，知道事物有此两方面，但同时须要知道这两方面在客观事物中是分不开的。具体的事物是两方面的对立的统一。这在知识上是经过分析而又回到统一。这就是知识的提高一步。这样就是知识的辩证的发展。
    但是知识很可能就停留在分析那一阶段上。由此而来的理论，就专强调个别与一般的对立，而忽略了它们的在客观事物中的统一。新理学那本书的理论就是知识停留在这一阶段的理论。
    因为有这一方面的强调，所以在解放以前，我所最不了解一个海格尔的哲学名词，就是“具体的共相”（就是特殊的一般）。照我以前的看法，这是两个自相矛盾的名词。现在我的看法是：当成名词看，这是两个自相矛盾的名词。但从事实看，每一个东西都是一个具体的共相。了解了它是怎样的一个具体的共相，我们就可以知道怎样处理它。
    对于具体的共相的了解，是我参加土改的一个主要的收获。在土改中，一件主要的工作是划成份。每一个人都有一个阶级成份；他是一个富农，或是一个贫农，或是一个自由职业者。他有个什么成份，就得到什么待遇。每一个人都不仅只是张三或李四，而是一个富农或贫农等。由这一方面说，他都是一个现实的共相。现实的共相，就是个体。因此它不是空洞的抽象的，而是有血有肉的。它是个具体的共相。
    我们现在反对美国，我们不是反对美国，而是反对一个帝国主义者。我们不是反对一个空洞的，抽象的，一般的，帝国主义者，而是美国那个帝国主义者。美国是一个帝国主义者。美国是个别，帝国主义者是一般。除了美国外，还有许多别的帝国主义者。每一帝国主义者，都与美国不尽相同，而都是帝国主义者，这就是说，每一个具体的帝国主义者，其内容都比抽象的帝国主义内容丰富。美国那个帝国主义者，就是一个具体的共相，一个特殊的一般。知道美国是一个帝国主义者，比只知道美国是美国，好得多，因为若知道它是个帝国主义者，就知怎样处理它。从美国这个帝国主义者去了解帝国主义者，也比专从“帝国主义者”的定义去了解帝国主义者好得多，因为定义是抽象的，一个具体的帝国主义者比一个抽象的定义，内容丰富得多。
    我的思想这样中止在分析这一阶段上，与我研究哲学的态度，是有关系的。我以前一向认为哲学家的任务是观察世界。宋朝的邵雍作有观物篇。以前我很喜欢“观物”两个字。程颢有“静观万物皆自得”一句诗，以前我很喜欢这“静观”两个字。以前我以为哲学家的任务，就是“静观”万物，在自己的思想中，将其加以分析。哲学家是一个宇宙的旁观者。这种态度，与新哲学的哲学家的态度完全相反。新理学的任务不仅要解释世界，而且要改造世界。实践不是与知识对立的，而是知识的一部分。在新哲学中，理论必需与实践合一。所以新哲学不能停留在分析那一阶段。它不仅注重一般与个别在思想中的对立，而且注重它们在实际上的统一。
    在解放以前，我本已不喜欢“唯心论”这个名词。我自以为我的哲学思想不是“唯心论”。我所以这样的“以为”，有两点理由。第一点，我的哲学思想承认有独立于心的外界。第二，我的哲学思想不承认心是宇宙的本质或根源。我承认心必有其物质的根据，始能存在。就第一点说，我的哲学思想不是旧哲学中所谓主观的唯心论。就第二点说，我的哲学思想也不是旧哲家中所谓客观的唯心论。有此两点理由，我一向不承认我的哲学思想是“唯心论的”。
    近来我才发现：因为我强调个别与一般的对立，这种过分的强调，后来演绎为一般可脱离了物质与自然独立而自有。这也是唯心论的一种。在某一方面我躲开了唯心论；但在另一方面，我又陷入了唯心论的窠臼。
    以前我以为《新理学》方法是对于事物作形式的分析。以前我很喜欢形式的这三个字。这是从形式逻辑来的。形式逻辑论到概念的联系时，不管概念与推论的内容，而只管其间的形式的关系。《新理学》中所谓形式的分析，亦是不管事物的具体的性质，而只对于事物，作形式的肯定。以为事物必都是某种事物，有某种事物必有某种事物之所以为某种事物者。某种事物之所以为某种事物者，《新理学》称之为理或共相（即一般）。这样只肯定有理。而对于理的内容，并不要知道。以为知道理的内容，是科学的任务。不是哲学的任务。
    可是这样的哲学是空的。以前我承认它是空的。并且以为哲学越空越好。它越空它就越纯粹。但是这样的哲学，有什么用处呢？我以前的回答是：这样哲学的用处，不在于增加人的知识，而在于提高人的“境界”。
    我在新原人那本书中提出的关于人的境界的说法。照现在看，那种提法及说法，是有害的。但是其中的主要意思，我现在还觉得是代表中国旧哲学的优良传统，在新社会中还是有用的。我觉得，新社会供给那个意思，以更多的例证。在新社会中有些事情，在形式上看，与旧社会中有些事情好像没有什么不同。例如工厂中的社会主义竞赛，在形式上看，好像就是资本主义的工厂中哄骗工人多出劳力的办法。可是觉悟的人知道，此二者在形式上虽有点相像，但是其意义是完全不同的。“红旗歌”以戏剧的方法，说明其间的不同，并说明觉悟了这样不同的人不仅工作对于他有了新的意义，生活对于他也有了新的意义。在新社会中，任何事都有了新意义，所以人的生活也有了新意义，这种新意义就构成了人的新的境界。
    在新社会中，道德标准提高了。实际上是要把每一个人的境界都提高到“道德境界”。这是新社会的一个极大的进步。有些人以为共产主义，只提倡“斗争”，不提倡“合作”，所以它是提倡自私自利。又以为共产主义注重“唯物”，所以只注重物质的享受，不注重精神的提高。这些论调，若非出于有意诽谤，就是出于完全无知。
    就我现在所觉到的，新原人那本书关于“天地境界”的说法，是有问题的。若说一个人应有他的宇宙观。他不仅要了解社会。还要了解宇宙。有了对于宇宙的了解，他的作为对于他就另有一种意义。例如：一个人了解劳动创造人类，劳动创造世界。另一个人了解劳动可以增加社会生产。另一个人了解劳动可以得到上级的奖赏。这三个人对于劳动的了解不同，他们去劳动的时候，劳动的意义不同，他们的境界也就不同了。照新原人的说法，了解劳动有创造世界的意义的人，本著这个意义去劳动，在这样的劳动中，他的境界是天地境界。这样的说法似乎没有什么害处。
    不过所谓天地境界很可能成为僧侣主义的逃避主义的渊薮。对于没有勇气为社会正义而奋斗的人，不能够把他自己提高到道德境界，他即躲到自以为是天地境界中去了。照新原人的理论说，这是不可能的。因为这样的逃避，是出于自私自利，作这样逃避的人的境界，实在是“功利境界”。我在理论上虽不以逃避为然，可是在行动上却是总在逃避。新原人对于别人也可能有这种影响。这种影响是有害的。
    不过提高人的境界并不必靠我所谓空的哲学。在以前我以为提高境界，是人人都需要的，而以前所谓“技术的”哲学，即烦琐哲学，则不是每个人所需要的（照现在看，它并不是任何人所需要的）。所以我有意将哲学精简到几个观念。这几个观念可以提高人的境界。这是新知言那本书的主要意思。可是现在看，这样空的观念，与实际脱离了联系。它所能提高的境界，大概是上面所说的逃避主义的。其实像劳动创造人类，及劳动创造世界，这一类的与实际联系的道理，一样可以提高人的境界。而且可以在实际的工作中提高人的境界。
    在新原道那本书里，我指出在中国哲学中，有两个倾向的对立；中国哲学的发展，是趋于将这个对立统一起来。这个讲法有辩证法的意思。有个英国人读了这本书，就问：“冯某人是不是个共产党？”当然这个问题证明他对于共产主义并不了解。那本书从辩证的观点指出了中国哲学发展，但不是从唯物论的观点。那两个倾向的对立所隐藏的，其实就是唯心论与唯物论的对立与矛盾。我应该将这种隐藏的实质揭露出来，并由此说明辩证唯物论的使命。辩证唯物论一方面对于以往的唯心论及机械唯物论，作“两条战线”的斗争，一方面又把它们优点统一起来。这是它的“继往开来”的历史使命。这种历史的使命，在历史中早已孕育起来，即在中国哲学的发展中，亦可见其端倪。
    我说新原人提出关于人的境界的说法，那种提法是有害的。因为它是就个人立论，从个人出发的。新世训那本书中，讲修养方法，也是就个人立论，从个人出发。至于新哲学则无论讲什么，都是就群众立论，从群众出发。这是旧哲学与新哲学中间的一个主要的分捩点。照中国旧哲学的说法，一个不甘于庸俗的人，要希圣希贤，这就是说，要想把他自己成为圣人。宋儒以为成为圣人的人，不是离开社会的人。他要在社会的活动中，提高他自己，完成他自己。这与佛家比起来，是进了一步，但是他总还是就个人立论，从个人出发。
    在新哲学中，一切都是从群众出发。“为人民服务”是对于每一个人在道德方面的要求。不但为“人民服务”，还要“全心全意”为人民服务。这就是说，为人民服务，不能有一丝一毫自私自利的动机。新社会又要求每个人都以批评与自我批评的武器，随时检讨，看他自己是否真是全心全意为人民服务。这样的出发点就不同。这不是因为要使自己成为圣人，所以为人民服务，而是要为人民服务，所以必先完全忘我。
    王阳明解释大学的三纲领，以亲民为明德的工夫。他说：“明明德必在于亲民，而亲民乃所以明明德也。”新哲学对于人在道德方面的要求正与这个相反。借用旧名词说，它是以明德为亲民的工夫。这样就把宋明道学整个地翻过来，如同马克思把海格尔整个地翻过来。
    在阶级社会里，私有财产的制度，使每个人都有一种习惯，就是遇事都先想到自己。无产阶级的哲学，就是无产阶级社会的哲学。在这种社会里，没有私有财产，因此也没有个人主义。一个人不但不想使他自己成为富人贵人，也不想使他自己成为圣人。可是他要为人民服务，他必须完全忘我。完全忘我是旧日所谓圣人的主要的成分。但是照旧日所讲成为圣人的方法，实在不能使人成为圣人。因为假使一个人老想着使他自己成为圣人，他还是老想着他自己。老想着他自己就是不能忘我。宋明道学家常以为，佛家的人想叫自己成佛，是自私的。照现在看，道学家想叫自己成圣人，又何尝不是自私的。
    在新世训那本书中，我有一篇讨论情感的问题。对于这个问题，我虽不主张如道家哲学所说“以理化情”的办法，但是我主张宋儒所说“情顺万物而无情”的理论。这种理论，现在无需细说，有一点可以说的，就是这种理论的实际的效果，是把情感冲淡了。它不能成为行为的推动力，而只是行为的一种无害的附属品。这样的理论，表现在我的态度及言语上。光明日报上有一篇通讯说我有一种异常的冷静。还有一位现在作乡村工作的清华同学给我的信上说：“抓住过我的，曾有两种语言。一种是《新理学》式的，一种是农民式的。但前者使我恬静，以至于冷酷，是沉醉。而后者则使我激奋到要流泪，要战斗。”当然冷静与冷酷，所差是很有限的。
    与革命队伍这方面的人接触以后，我觉得无论是他们的行事或言论，都是充满了热情。我想关于革命的发展，大概有这一种的情形。在革命的初期，革命的人，大多专靠天真的，自发的，热情，而缺乏理智的组织与计划。我所见过的辛亥革命及五四运动，都有这种情形。现在革命，则是有整套的理论与计划，而又推动之以最高的热情。在革命的行动中，理智领导了感情，好像领袖领导了群众。这样理智与情感统一的人生，才是现实的丰富的人生。以前我以为我的那种办法也是已经得到理智与情感的统一，但是照那种办法，情感在实际上不能起积极作用。所以那种办法仍是偏向于消灭情感那一方面。这就是僧侣主义的偏向。
    总结起来说，我近来发现，我以前的哲学思想，不合于辩证唯物论的根本之点，在于辩证唯物论的精神与方法，注重在事物中的对立及对立的统一，而我以前的哲学思想的精神与方法，注重在事物中的对立的对立。因此与实践结合的时候，辩证唯物论的精神与方法所得到的，到处都是统一，理论与实际统一，个人与群众统一，理智与情感统一。我以前的哲学思想的精神与方法所得到的，到处都是脱节。理论与实际脱节。个人与群众脱节。理智与情感脱节。
    对于茅先生的对于新理学的评价，我有一些修正与补充。
    第一，有些人以为我是主张复古开倒车的。这个我觉得不完全合乎事实。我的新事论。现在看起来，虽有许多的缺点，但总不能说是主张复古或开倒车。我也不相信不经革命的流血斗争即可使新社会来临。不过我害怕流血。害怕自己流血，也害怕别人流血。《新理学》是以发挥“理学”开始，可是后来道家及禅宗的气味，越来越重。它确是“代表着旧知识分子在现社会的失望悲观中而又没有力量求改革”，如茅先生所说的。
    第二，茅先生说《新理学》是被压迫阶级的哲学。这大概是他的客气之辞。在以前，我以为我是超阶级的，我的哲学思想也是超阶级的，它是对于任何阶级的社会都可以用的。近来我了解，自以为是超阶级的这个思想，本身就是统治阶级的思想。当然所谓统治阶级，其中又有许多阶层。我与以前的绝大多数的哲学家一样，都是属于所谓士大夫阶层的。它在旧社会中，“比上不足，比下有余”。在过去有个时候，我对于新哲学有相当的爱好。它几乎要把我吸引到革命这边来。但是我害怕改变我的“正常”生活。这种“正常”生活，当然就是旧社会中一般士大夫的生活。这种生活决定我的思想向传统的哲学中钻牛角尖与打圈子。
    抗日战争激发了我的民族主义的情感。这种情感，使我的哲学思想以总结旧哲学的方式表现出来。我近来觉得，总结旧哲学的工作，有两种作法：一种是对以前哲学思想作一个批评的总批判；一种是对于以前哲学思想作一个同情的总了解。我以前所作的是后一种的总结。在旧社会将要崩溃之际，我要对于以前的思想，作“同情”的了解，在客观的作用上说，岂不是等于要挽救它的崩溃。而挽救旧社会的崩溃，正是当时的统治阶级所需要的。我近来觉得：同是一句话，在不同的时候说，对不同的人说，用不同的方式说，都会有不同的社会作用。这一点我以前并没有注意到。
    茅先生说：在解放以前，《新理学》曾经是一个思想的支柱。假若真是一个支柱，问题就在这里了。无论我在主观上是怎样想法，可是在客观的影响上，这个支柱是旧社会的支柱。在旧社会是革命的对象的时候，这个思想的支柱，当然也成为革命的对象了。
    在客观方面有这样的情形。在主观方面，则有如有一位同学与我的信上说的。他说：“吾师在中国传统哲学中，‘为王’太久，受害可真大，现在可要常敲警钟。个人要有所发现，完全必要，用功的精神，更须发扬。但绝不许‘称孤道寡’连此思想及其相关的情感，都不许有。……这点上正如你自己所说：‘必须努力克服。’”
    第三，茅先生说：新理学的流行，是一幕悲剧。从一方面看，可以这样说。在以前我不会有阶级观点，但是民族观点确是有的。上面说过，在抗日战争中，民族主义予我以很大的激发。我有意发挥我认为是民族思想的优良传统，以为这是与民族有利的。可是后来革命的发展，使我的工作成为革命的阻碍，也成为民族利益的阻碍。从这一方面说，可以说，是悲剧。
    若从别的方面说，无所谓悲剧。中国近代史变化得太剧烈，太快了。往往一个时期，在时间上，不过是几年的工夫，可是在内容上，可以相当于普通历史中一个很长的时代。《新理学》在开始的时候，是有它的进步性的。我不相信一个完全没有进步性的东西，会在某一时能有相当的流行。就“新理学”说，它反对当时的实验主义的不可知论。它反对当时直觉主义的非理性主义。它提倡逻辑的分析与清楚的思想。它试从唯物史观的观点，解决中国文化问题。它的民族主义的色彩在对日抗战时期，在某方面相当地起了鼓动的作用。可是中国变得太快。不久它就失掉了进步性，而成为进步的障碍，“为历史所清算”。这是“势所必至”，无所为悲剧。
    在我们习惯于旧哲学的人，社会的转变，是我们的幸运。新哲学的成立，已竟有一百年的历史，但我们对于它，或是浅尝辄止，或是熟视无睹。直到全社会的改变，才使我们开始了解新哲学的真理。这等于以全社会的转变，为我们作了一个科学的实验。我们能遇到这样的一个伟大的实验场面，岂非千载一时的机会。
    生在新社会中的人，回看旧社会中的生活习惯，以及思想情感，好像是游山的人，上在一个更高的山峰；回看以前所以为是最高的山峰，已经是在脚的下，而它的全貌，以前所看不见的，现在已经看清楚了，它的缺点，以前不显露的，现在已经显露出来了。在这种情形下，人能知道他的以前的偏见与错误，这实在是非常幸运的。
