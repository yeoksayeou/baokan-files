Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 27th: Large-scale autumn logging operations in the Northeast forest region began in mid-September. The entire region plans to harvest 3.6 million cubic meters of timber this autumn. As of the 15th of this month, thanks to the diligent work of over 35,000 forestry workers in various forest farms, the region has already completed 20.8% of the total autumn logging plan. Workers at the Liaodong Province Forest Industry Bureau have already completed 45.4% of their original plan.

There are two major improvements in this year's autumn forestry production in the Northeast: first, all logging work is being carried out by forestry workers; second, the method of autumn logging and winter transportation has been implemented. These two measures can avoid the chaos and waste of manpower that occurred last year when large numbers of farmers were mobilized to carry out both logging and transportation simultaneously.

　　东北秋季伐木工作开始
    全区计划采伐三百六十万立方公尺
    【新华社沈阳二十七日电】东北林区大规模的秋季伐木工作，已自九月中旬开始。全区计划在今秋伐木三百六十万立方公尺。截至本月十五日止，在各林场三万五千多林业工人的努力工作下，全区现已完成全部秋季伐木计划的百分之二十点八；辽东省森林工业管理局工人现已完成原订计划的百分之四十五点四。
    东北今年秋季林业生产的方法有两大改进：第一是采伐工作全由林业工人进行；第二是实行了秋季采伐，冬季搬运的作业方法。上述两项办法，可以避免去年动员大批农民实行采伐和搬运并进所发生的混乱和浪费人力的现象。
