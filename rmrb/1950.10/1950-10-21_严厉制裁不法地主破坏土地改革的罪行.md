    Severely Punish Unlawful Landlords Who Sabotage Land Reform
    Since the promulgation of the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China, Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report on land reform, and the decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government on the division of rural class components, the broad masses of peasants in rural areas, especially poor peasants and farm laborers, have expressed enthusiastic support, because they know that they will get land and thus get rid of the exploitation and oppression of the feudal system. Workers, other working people, freelancers, and national bourgeoisie in the cities also support land reform, considering that land reform will create the primary condition for a fundamental improvement in the national financial and economic situation and pave the way for the country's industrialization. The rich peasants in rural areas, due to the policy of preserving the rich peasant economy adopted by the Land Reform Law, have also dispelled their fear of land reform and are at ease with production. As for the landlord class, the entire class is the object of land reform and of course does not approve of land reform. However, because the Land Reform Law and the decision on the division of rural class components, on the one hand, decided to resolutely abolish the feudal exploitation of land ownership, which is already unavoidable, and on the other hand, decided to give lenient treatment to ordinary landlords, such as giving them the same share of land and other means of production as the peasants who obtain land, not touching their concurrently operated industrial and commercial businesses, as long as they abide by the laws and decrees of the People's Government after land reform and conscientiously transform themselves through labor, they can change their class components after five years, etc. Therefore, many landlords have expressed their willingness to obey the Land Reform Law. All of this shows that the Land Reform Law, Vice Chairman Liu's report, and the decision on the division of rural class components are completely correct, that the anti-feudal united front is very strong, that the feudal forces have been completely isolated, and that land reform will be successfully completed.
    However, land reform is, after all, a fierce class struggle, and the most stubborn elements of the landlord class are bound to and already are sabotaging land reform in a more vicious way. This is what we must be vigilant against and resolutely oppose.
    According to incomplete materials from various places, the main ways in which landlords sabotage land reform activities are: (1) Dispersing land and other property that should be confiscated. They either sell these properties at low prices, squander and waste them, or transfer them to concurrently operated industrial and commercial businesses to evade confiscation; or "give them away to relatives and friends," or disperse them to their old tenants and old farmhands, ostensibly dispersing them but not actually dispersing them, or temporarily dispersing them, waiting for the land reform to pass before coercing them to return them; thereby creating difficulties in the implementation of land reform and provoking disunity within the peasants. (2) Sabotaging production. Such as killing cattle, destroying farm tools, demolishing houses, cutting down forests, destroying water conservancy, and even putting salt in the fields, making the land unable to be cultivated. (3) Using money and women to buy off cadres and peasant activists, and sending lackeys and agents to infiltrate peasant associations to carry out sabotage. (4) Spreading rumors, confusing the peasants, and even plotting to assassinate village cadres and peasant activists, and organizing armed riots. These sabotage activities of the landlords are criminal acts that cannot be tolerated in the slightest and must be immediately and effectively stopped, and these unlawful landlords must be severely punished.
    Article 2 of the Land Reform Law stipulates: "Confiscate the landlords' land, draught animals, farm implements, surplus grain, and surplus houses in the countryside..." This means that these land properties are no longer owned by the landlords in law. Before land reform, landlords only had the responsibility to protect these properties, but had no right to dispose of them in any way, let alone destroy, disperse, sell, or transfer them. Otherwise, it would be damage to the property of the state and the people, it would be a violation of the law, and they would have to be sanctioned by the national law. The People's Government has long had explicit regulations on this point. Article 8 of the Land Reform Law specifically stipulates: "All land that should be confiscated and requisitioned according to the provisions of this Law, if it is transferred or dispersed by sale, mortgage, gift, or other means after the local liberation, shall be invalid. This land shall be included in the number of land to be distributed." Article 33 stipulates: "Before the completion of land reform, in order to ensure the order of land reform and protect the wealth of the people, all illegal slaughter of draught animals, felling of trees, and abandonment of land, destruction of farm implements, water conservancy, buildings, crops, or other items are strictly prohibited. Violators shall be subject to trial and punishment by the People's Court." Therefore, those unlawful landlords who disregard the laws and decrees of the People's Government and knowingly violate them must no longer be tolerated and must be punished according to law.
    Therefore, we believe that all land and other properties of landlords that should be confiscated according to the Land Reform Law, regardless of the manner in which the landlord transferred or dispersed them after liberation, should not only be declared invalid, but also be ordered to return them in full. If the price obtained by the landlord in transferring and dispersing the land property is insufficient, the court may order the conversion of their other property (including the landlord's concurrently operated industrial and commercial businesses) that should not be confiscated according to law to offset the difference. Only if this is done and it is still insufficient can they be allowed to pay less, defer payment, or be exempted from payment at its discretion. For those who have sold the property that should be confiscated or transferred and hidden it in industrial and commercial businesses, the court should also order it to be recovered. Doing so does not violate the policy of protecting industry and commerce. Because this is not the property of industry and commerce, but the feudal property of the landlord that should be confiscated. If it is not recovered, it will open the door for the landlord to disperse property.
    In addition to ordering the landlords to compensate for the draught animals, farm implements, houses, land, forests, etc. that were killed and destroyed by unlawful landlords in accordance with the above principles, the people's court should also impose appropriate penalties on the destroyers according to the seriousness of the circumstances.
    Any unlawful landlord who threatens, lures, buys off, or bribes cadres and peasants shall, in addition to confiscating the property used for bribery, also be punished by the People's Court according to the seriousness of the circumstances.
    Unlawful landlords who have committed counter-revolutionary crimes such as spreading rumors to mislead the public, plotting assassinations, and armed riots should be subject to severe legal sanctions; their ringleaders must be resolutely suppressed and sentenced to long-term imprisonment or death in accordance with the law.
    Only in this way can we effectively stop the crimes of unlawful landlords in sabotaging land reform and ensure the thorough realization of land reform.
    Of course, while dealing with these unlawful landlords, we should also carry out extensive propaganda work to explain the land reform policy of the People's Government and give all law-abiding landlords the opportunity for labor reform and a way out for life. We must especially strengthen the propaganda and education work among the peasant masses, raise their class vigilance, and not fall into the trap of the landlords because of the landlords' petty favors, and undermine the interests of the collective. The peasants should organize themselves and closely monitor any sabotage activities of the landlords and fight to defend their own fruits of liberation. At the same time, we must also educate our cadres to overcome their paralysis of thought. The main manifestation of this thinking is that many of our cadres one-sidedly emphasize the favorable political situation and the landlords' inability to defy the Land Reform Law, while ignoring the nature of the landlord class and the twists and turns and complexities in specific struggles. It should be recognized that, due to the favorable overall political situation and the correctness of our policies, some landlords have expressed their willingness to obey the land reform decrees and hand over their land and other property that should be confiscated; but there are also many of the most reactionary landlords who, because their own class is facing extinction, are bound to hate land reform even more and actively sabotage land reform. We must correctly assess these two aspects in order to treat them differently and further isolate the small number of most reactionary landlords, so that land reform can move forward smoothly.

### 严厉制裁不法地主破坏土地改革的罪行

    严厉制裁不法地主破坏土地改革的罪行
    自中华人民共和国土地改革法，刘少奇副主席关于土地改革的报告和中央人民政府政务院关于划分农村阶级成份的决定公布之后，农村中广大农民群众特别是贫农和雇农都表示热烈拥护，因为他们知道，他们将得到土地，从此摆脱封建制度的剥削和压迫了。城市里的工人、其他劳动人民，自由职业者和民族资产阶级，鉴于土地改革将创造全国财政经济基本好转的首要条件，为国家的工业化开辟道路，因而也支持土地改革。农村里的富农由于土地改革法采取了保存富农经济的方针，也解除了对于土地改革的恐惧心理，安心生产。至于地主阶级，就整个阶级来说，是土地改革的对象，当然是不赞成土地改革的。然而由于土地改革法和划分农村阶级成份的决定，一方面决定坚决废除封建剥削的土地所有制，已经无可避免，另一方面又决定对一般地主个人宽大处理，例如分给他们与得地农民同样的一份土地及其他生产资料，不动他们兼营的工商业，只要他们在土地改革后遵守人民政府法令，认真劳动改造自己，五年之后即可改变阶级成份等等，因此也有不少地主表示愿意服从土地改革法。所有这一切，都说明土地改革法、刘副主席报告和划分农村阶级成份的决定等文献是完全正确的，说明反封建统一战线是非常强大的，说明封建势力已经完全孤立，也说明土地改革必将顺利完成。
    然而土地改革毕竟是一场激烈的阶级斗争，地主阶级中最顽固的分子，必然要而且已经在更加狠毒地破坏土地改革。这是我们必须警惕与坚决反对的。
    根据各地不完全的材料，地主破坏土地改革活动的方式主要是：（一）分散土地及其他应被没收的财产。他们将这些财产，或则廉价出卖，挥霍浪费，或则转移到兼营的工商业中去以逃避没收；或则“分赠亲友”，或分散给其老佃户、老长工，明分暗不分或假分，或暂行分散，待土地改革过后再胁迫退回；以此造成土地改革执行中的困难，并挑拨农民内部的团结。（二）破坏生产。如杀害耕牛，毁坏农具，拆毁房屋，砍伐山林，破坏水利，甚至在地里放盐，使田地不能耕种。（三）以金钱女色收买干部和农民积极分子，派狗腿子和代理人钻入农民协会进行破坏。（四）散布谣言，蛊惑农民，以至阴谋杀害乡村干部和农民积极分子，组织武装暴乱等。地主的这些阴谋破坏活动，是丝毫不能容忍的犯罪行为，必须立即有效地予以制止，并对这些不法地主予以严厉的惩办。
    土地改革法的第二条规定：“没收地主的土地、耕畜、农具、多余的粮食及其在农村中多余的房屋……”。这就是说，这些土地财产在法律上已经不是地主所有的了。在土地改革之前，地主对这些财产，只有保护之责，而无任何支配之权，更不得破坏、分散、出卖和转移。否则，就是对国家人民财产的损害，就是犯法，就必须受到国家法律的制裁。关于这一点，人民政府早有明文规定。土地改革法第八条具体地规定：“本法规定所有应加没收和征收的土地，在当地解放以后，如以出卖、出典、赠送或其他方式转移分散者，一律无效。此项土地，应计入分配土地的数目之内。”又在第三十三条中规定：“在土地改革完成以前，为保证土地改革的秩序及保护人民的财富，严禁一切非法的宰杀耕畜，砍伐树木，并严禁荒废土地，破坏农具、水利、建筑物、农作物或其他物品，违者应受人民法庭的审判及处分。”因此，对于那些藐视人民政府法令，明知故犯的不法地主，决不能再予宽容，必须依法制裁。
    因此，我们认为，凡土地改革法规定应予没收的地主土地和其他财产，不论地主在解放后以任何方式转移分散者，除一律宣布无效外，并应勒令地主如数退出，其在转移分散土地财产时所获得之代价，不足时可由法庭判决将他们的依法不应没收的其他财产（包括地主兼营的工商业在内）变价抵还。只有照这样做了之后，仍不足时，才可以酌情准其少交、缓交或免交。对于已经变卖应没收的财产或转移隐藏在工商业中者，也应由法庭判决追取出来。这样做，并不违犯保护工商业的政策。因为这不是工商业的财产，而是地主的应予没收的封建财产，如果不予追回，就是给地主分散财产开了方便之门。
    被不法地主杀害与破坏了的耕畜、农具、房屋、土地、林木等，除同样按上述原则责令地主赔偿之外，并应视其情节轻重，由法庭判处破坏者以应得的罪刑。
    凡向干部及农民进行威胁利诱收买贿赂等行为之不法地主，除没收其用以施行贿买的财物外，亦应由人民法庭根据情节轻重予以处分。
    凡有造谣惑众，阴谋暗杀，武装暴乱等反革命罪行的不法地主，更应予以严厉的法律制裁；对其首要分子，更必须坚决予以镇压，依法处以长期徒刑或死刑。
    只有这样，才能有效地制止不法地主破坏土地改革的罪行，也才能保证土地改革的彻底实现。
    当然，与处理这些不法地主的同时，还应进行广泛的宣传工作，解释人民政府的土地改革政策，对于守法的地主，一律给以劳动改造的机会和生活的出路。我们要特别加强对农民群众的宣传教育工作，提高他们的阶级警惕性，不要因为地主的小恩小惠而上了地主的圈套，破坏了集体的利益。农民应当大家组织起来，严密地监视地主的任何破坏活动，为保卫自己的翻身果实而斗争。同时也要教育我们的干部，克服他们的麻痹思想。这种思想的主要表现，是我们不少干部，片面地强调了有利的政治形势，强调了地主对土地改革法的不敢违抗，忽视了地主阶级的本质和在具体斗争中的曲折性与复杂性。应该认识，由于整个政治形势的有利和我们政策的正确，固然有一部分地主表示愿意服从土地改革法令，交出自己的土地及其他应被没收的财产；但也有不少的一部分最反动的地主，却因为他们自己的阶级面临灭亡，必然更加仇视土地改革，更积极地破坏土地改革。必须正确地估计到这两方面，以便加以分别对待，进一步孤立少数最反动的地主，使土地改革顺利前进。
