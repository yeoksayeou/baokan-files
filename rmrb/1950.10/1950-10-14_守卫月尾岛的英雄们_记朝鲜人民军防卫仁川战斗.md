The defense battle from Wolmido Island to the Incheon coast was a series of bloody battles. The People's Army coastal defense forces fought a heroic and bloody battle at A-can Bay (transliteration) and Songdo in Incheon Port to counter enemies with dozens of times their strength.

The enemy mobilized more than 300 warships and 500 aircraft to approach the Incheon sea. On September 10th, mercenary troops of U.S. imperialism, under the cover of air raids, began the preliminary battle for the landing.

Intense artillery fire, as dense as raindrops, continued for three days. Flames and black smoke filled Wolmido Island. Lush vegetation was burned, and the People's Army's fortifications were covered with earth. These beast-like mercenaries sprinkled gasoline from the air and dropped incendiary bombs, burning everything to ashes.

Hundreds of enemy planes circled overhead for twenty-four hours, and the flares dropped at night made it as bright as day. Huang Yuanzhao's (transliteration) squad's combatants, Li Daxun's (transliteration) artillery squad's combatants, and Yuan Jiyang's (transliteration) communications squad's observation post sentries, all guarding the coast, were covered with dirt and ash. But regardless of the situation, they jumped up, their bodies covered in blood, and held their defensive positions, repairing the fortifications that had collapsed due to the shelling. The preliminary battle proceeded under this storm of artillery fire from the beginning.

On the morning of the 13th, the shadows of enemy ships clearly appeared in the observation post's telescope and on the artillery positions.

Enemy destroyers sailed between Dafu Island and Yeongheung Island (transliteration). Countless black dots appeared on the horizon, and from those black dots, streaks of black smoke rose to the sky. Around 5:50 a.m., large formations of enemy planes began continuous bombing. Enemy destroyers, landing craft, and landing boats approached the waterway north of Wolmido Island. Enemy destroyers "727" and "728" gradually approached, and finally our coastal artillery forces opened fire in unison, every muzzle spewing out the accumulated anger in their hearts, continuing concentrated artillery fire, hitting enemy ships one by one. Enemy ships caught fire, pillars of fire soared into the sky, and the listing enemy ships began to flee. The fierce battle between coastal artillery and naval guns continued for seven hours. Near Palmi Island, three enemy destroyers and three landing craft sank deep into the sea after a loud explosion.

Under the continuous bombing cover of enemy planes and the continued shelling of enemy warships, our artillery positions collapsed. Li Daxun, the artillery squad leader, disregarding the fire on his body and the sand that had entered his wounds, bravely continued to command, driving the enemy far back. However, communication with our forces was cut off. Yuan Jiyang, a member of the communications squad, bravely set up a telephone line and set off toward Wolmido Island. Enemy warships fired continuously, machine gunners fell. Cui Shanhao (transliteration) and four others took up the heavy machine gun and fired at the enemy landing craft, and then the cries of the enemy were heard. The gun barrel became red-hot and was about to bend, and the bullets were also used up.

The battle became increasingly fierce, and the terrain of Wolmido Island changed. In the evening, hundreds of people, in order to defend Wolmido Island and Incheon, the gateway to the capital of the motherland, rebuilt defensive positions and artillery positions.

On the 14th, the enemy attempted to land again, mobilizing a large number of warships to approach our positions under the cover of hundreds of enemy planes. The sea surface between the islands was covered with enemy ships, and a fierce artillery battle began again. The superior enemy continued to shell, but our army persevered with indomitable spirit. The gun carriages flew into the air and then fell down, but the combatants of Li Daxun's artillery squad continued to fight unyieldingly. In the cheers after hitting an enemy ship, an enemy destroyer listed, and an explosion sounded in the sea.

The gunners would not leave their guns until their last breath!

The young Lance Corporal Jiang Yilu (transliteration) tapped out radio codes for forty-eight hours without food or sleep. Observer Yin Chengwen (transliteration) walked through the rain of artillery shells, unable to open his eyes due to the smoke, but completed the liaison mission to SOWOLMI Island.

That is how the People’s Army firmly defended Wolmido Island!

The enemy's landing attempt, carried out with hundreds of times the troop strength and firepower under the cover of five hundred planes, was again thwarted. The coastal defense forces' combatants' hearts burned with the will to fight for their country. They all had weapons of noble patriotism that were stronger than the enemy's firepower or planes.

The defensive battle against the enemy's landing attempt had been going on in thick smoke for two days. The sea horizon also began to turn red.

On the 15th, a fierce melee for every inch of land unfolded, and the sound of enemy and our guns shook the coast.

The sea off Incheon began to boil, and the sound of artillery fire from the artillery positions finally stopped.

The shells were exhausted, and the gun barrels were also burned. Li Daxun, the artillery squad leader, picked up his pistol and charged forward. Following him, the combatants also charged forward. Huang Yuanzhao's (transliteration) squad's combatants also advanced toward the coastline, stabbing enemies while moving forward. Communications soldiers and medics also joined the melee. The enemy warships and mercenaries, who had surrounded Wolmido Island from three sides, began to crawl onto our motherland's territory.

In order to prevent the enemy from desecrating even an inch of the motherland's territory, our heroic combatants resisted the enemy's landing with bloody battles.

The People's Army soldiers who guarded Wolmido Island shed their noble blood and fell on the territory of the motherland. The combatants who fought on SOWOLMI Island crossed the sea on enemy ships to reach Incheon in order to defend Incheon.

Incheon Bay faced high tide, and enemy landing craft arrived at the dock. The enemies climbed ashore. The People's Army's automatic rifle company, which was defending the dock, opened fire together, destroying some landing craft. After three volleys of automatic rifle fire, the enemy's landing craft were prevented from advancing, and then they approached the enemy with hand grenades in melee combat, sweeping them away. Everything was exhausted.

The enemy's naval guns and planes began to attack continuously. The streets of Incheon were burning, and the enemy was further reinforced, and that's how the day passed.

At seven o'clock on the morning of the 17th, the last communication was received from the rear. Comrade Jin Mingshu (transliteration), the female switchboard operator, in the Incheon Post Office, surrounded by flames and enemies, relayed the last communication to the command post. She replied to the command post, saying: "I see one, two, three... tanks outside the window... the enemy is coming in." Jin Mingshu, the switchboard operator, who completed her mission while surrounded by the enemy, did not return to the ranks. The People's Army coastal defense forces gave their lives to uphold their mission, and they well practiced their oath, and their actions were heroic.

The names of the many heroes who resisted the enemy with their lives on Wolmido Island, in the Incheon sea, and in the Incheon city area will be immortalized with the motherland!

They heroically gave their lives, loudly calling to the people in the rear:

"Send more weapons and ammunition to the front line!"

"Everything for victory!"

"Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!"

"Consolidate and unite around our leader, General Kim Il-sung, and strive for victory!"

　　守卫月尾岛的英雄们
    ——记朝鲜人民军防卫仁川战斗
    平壤《民主朝鲜》特派记者  金英龙
    从月尾岛至仁川海岸的防御战，是一连串的血战。人民军海岸防卫部队，为了迎击数十倍兵力的敌人，在仁川港的阿参湾（译音）松岛，进行了一场英勇的浴血的战斗。
    敌人动员了三百余艘军舰和五百余架飞机接近了仁川海面。九月十日美帝国主义的雇佣兵，在飞机袭击下开始了登陆前哨战。
    两点般密集的炮击连续了三天，月尾岛弥漫着火焰和黑烟，茂盛的草木被烧焦了，人民军的防御工事被土盖住了。这些野兽般的雇佣兵，在空中洒汽油并投了烧夷弹，一切都被烧得变成灰烬了。
    数百架敌机在上空回旋了二十四小时，到夜间所投的照明弹象白天那样亮。防卫海岸的部队黄元照（译音）区分队的战斗员和李大勋（译音）炮兵区分队战斗员，以及元基阳（译音）通讯区分队监视哨哨员们，都被土和灰盖住了全身。但是他们不顾这种情况，跃起鲜血淋淋的身躯，坚守防卫阵地，修筑着由于炮击而塌倒的工事，前哨战从开始一直在这种暴风雨般的炮击下进行着。
    十三日晨，在监视哨的望远镜和炮台眼上明显的出现了敌舰的影子。
    敌驱逐舰开到了大付岛和永兴岛（译音）中间，水平面上出现了无数黑点，在那黑点里，条条的黑烟冲着天空。由上午五时五十分许，敌机大编队开始了不间断的轰炸，敌人的驱逐舰登陆艇以及登陆小舟接近月尾岛以北的航路。敌驱逐舰“七二七”“七二八”号渐渐接近了，终于我们的海岸炮兵部队一齐开炮，所有的炮口都吐出满积在心上的愤怒火焰，继续着集中炮击，一个一个打中了敌舰。敌舰起火，火柱冲天，歪斜的敌舰开始逃走。海岸炮对舰炮的激烈战斗继续了七小时之久。在八尾岛附近，敌驱逐舰三艘和登陆艇三艘于巨声爆炸之后深深地沉没在海中。
    在敌机继续掩拥轰炸和敌舰继续炮击之下，我军的炮阵地塌了，李大勋炮区分队长不顾身上着了火，伤口又钻进砂粒，勇敢的继续指挥，把敌人远远地击退，但是和我军的通讯连络断了，元基阳通信区分队队员勇敢的架上电线向月尾岛出发了。敌人不间断的打着舰炮，重机射手倒下去了，崔善浩（译音）等四名把着重机向敌人的登陆艇射过去，于是听到敌人的惨叫，枪身打的通红快要弯曲的时候，枪弹也用完了。
    战斗越来越激烈，月尾岛地形都变了，晚间，数百名人民为保卫祖国首都之门户的月尾岛和仁川，重新构筑了防卫阵地和炮兵阵地。
    十四日敌人再次企图登陆，在数百敌机掩护下动员了大量军舰迫近我阵地。岛和岛中间的海面上，布满了敌舰，炽烈的炮击战又开始了。优势的敌人继续炮击，但是我军以不屈的精神支持下去，炮架飞在空中又落下来，但是李大勋炮区分队的战斗员，不屈的继续着战斗。在命中敌舰后的欢呼里，敌驱逐舰倾斜下去，海里响了爆炸的声音。
    炮手们决不离炮，直到咽气！
    年青的姜益律（译音）上等兵，四十八小时不食不眠的打无线电电码，尹成文（译音）监视兵在如雨的炮弹下面走，由于硝烟的遮掩连眼睛也不能睁开，但却完成了到达小月尾岛的连络任务。
    人民军就是这样地坚守着月尾岛！
    敌人以数百倍的兵力和火力在五百架飞机的掩护下，进行的登陆企图，又受到挫折。海岸防卫部队战斗员们的胸膛里，燃烧着爱祖国的斗志。他们都有比敌人火力或飞机更加坚固的高贵的爱国主义精神的武器。
    抗拒敌军登陆的防卫战，两天来一直在浓黑的烟硝中进行着。海上水平线也开始染成红色了。
    十五日展开了互争每一寸土地的惨烈的肉搏战，敌我的炮声震动着海岸。
    仁川海面开始沸腾起来，炮阵地的炮声终于停止了。
    炮弹用尽了，炮身也烧毁了，李大勋炮兵区分队长端起了短枪向前冲，追随着他，战斗员们也向前冲上去。黄元照（译音）区分队战斗员们也向着海岸线一面刺杀敌人一面前进。通讯兵卫生兵也都参加了肉搏战。从三面包围月尾岛的敌军舰雇佣兵们，开始向我们祖国疆土上爬进来了。
    为了祖国的疆土一寸也不让仇敌蹂躏，我们英勇的战斗员们用血战抗拒了仇敌的登陆。
    守卫月尾岛的人民军战士们，在祖国疆土上，流下高贵的鲜血倒下去了。在小月尾岛上斗争的战斗员们为了保卫仁川，穿过敌军舰浮水到达仁川。
    仁川湾面临满潮，敌登陆艇到了码头，仇敌们爬上了陆地。保卫码头的人民军自动步枪中队，一起开火，破坏了一些登陆艇。经过三次自动步枪的一起扫射，阻止了敌人登陆艇的前进，随后带着手榴弹以肉搏战接近敌人，将他们扫荡了。一切都用尽了。
    敌人的军舰炮火和飞机开始不断的攻击，仁川街巷燃烧着，敌人更加增强，这样度过了一天。
    十七日早晨七点，后方接到了最后的通讯。女交换手金明秀（译音）同志，在被火焰和敌人包围的仁川邮政局里，将最后的连络转给指挥处，她答复指挥处说：“窗外看见坦克一个、两个、三个……敌军进来了。”在被敌人包围下完成了自己任务的金明秀交换手，没有回到队伍。人民军海岸防卫部队为坚守自己的任务，付出了生命，他们很好的实践了自己的宣誓，他们的行动是英勇的。
    在月尾岛、仁川海以及仁川市区，用生命抵拒敌人的许多英雄的名字，将同祖国永垂不朽！
    他们英勇的献出自己的生命，大声号召后方人民：
    “送给前线更多的武器弹药！”
    “一切为了胜利！”
    “朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！”
    “巩固团结在我们的领袖金日成将军周围争取胜利！”
