　　Shandong Province Agricultural and Forestry Department Rectification:
    Examination of Agricultural Production Leadership
    [This newspaper dispatch] According to the Shandong Dazhong Daily News: The rectification movement of the Shandong Province Agricultural and Forestry Department has now entered the stage of summarizing and examining the work. On the 15th of this month, the department convened a cadre meeting of its subordinate units, where Deputy Director Wang Tao made an enlightening self-criticism report. The report pointed out that although the Agricultural and Forestry Department has achieved some success in leading agricultural production in the past six months, it must not be complacent because there are still many shortcomings and errors in its work. This is manifested in: 1. The 1950 agricultural production plan was not realistic enough. This year's production plan was formulated for the first time, and there was a lack of experience. In addition, the leadership was aloof and did not know enough about the situation below, resulting in the failure of many plans, causing undue losses to the work and the property of the people and the motherland. For example, "sodium fluoride" was blindly expanded to produce more than one million catties before it was successfully tested. As a result, its insecticidal effect was not significant, it could not be promoted, and it was opposed by the masses. Other tasks, such as manufacturing and lending waterwheels, and selecting superior varieties, failed to complete the planned goals. 2. In implementing the plan and leading agricultural production, there was a lack of foresight. It failed to grasp the basic key of the seasonality of agricultural production and taking care of the habits of the masses, and to issue calls and solve problems in a timely manner. Many tasks were arranged late, the time was tight, or they became after-the-fact actions. For example, the instructions for wheat harvest seed selection and autumn harvest and autumn planting were issued late. Other tasks, such as the promotion of new agricultural tools and peanut rhizobium inoculation, were not carried out in a timely manner. The main reason is that the leadership has not been able to lead production as seriously as the farmers care about their own production. In arranging work, only general arrangements were made. In checking the implementation of the plan and guiding production, there was also a lack of in-depth inspection and individual guidance, so that it was impossible to grasp the overall business situation, to foresee and timely put forward problems to solve problems, and to guide work. 3. The work in the office also showed a busy, passive, and bureaucratic style, and ideological leadership was weak. Some cadres were not at ease in their work, did not study their business, and new cadres had a mercenary view. Finally, the report analyzed in detail the root causes of the above-mentioned undesirable work styles, and pointed out the ways to improve the work in the future, which greatly enlightened leaders at all levels and general cadres.

　　山东省农林厅整风中
    检查农业生产领导
    【本报讯】据山东大众日报消息：山东省农林厅的整风运动，现已进入总结检查工作阶段。本月十五日，该厅召集所属各单位干部大会，由副厅长王涛作启发性的检讨报告。报告指出：农林厅半年来领导农业生产的工作，虽然获得了一些成绩，但决不能以此自满，因为工作上还存在很多缺点和错误。这表现在：一、一九五○年农业生产计划不够切合实际。今年生产计划是初次制订，缺乏经验，加以领导上高高在上，对下面的情况了解不够，结果不少计划落空，工作和人民祖国的财产遭到不应有的损失。如“氟化钠”未试验成功，即盲目扩大制造百余万斤，结果杀虫效力不大，推广不出去，遭到群众反对。其他如制造、贷放水车，选购优良品种等工作，都未能完成预订计划。二、在贯彻计划，领导农业生产中，缺乏预见。未能掌握农业生产的季节性与照顾群众习惯的基本关键，及时的提出号召与解决问题。不少工作布置较晚，时间仓促，或变成马后炮。如麦收选种指示与秋收秋种指示都发得较晚，其他如推广新式农具与花生根瘤菌接种都作得不及时。主要原因，是领导上没有能够像农民关心自己的生产那样认真地来领导生产。在布置工作上，只作到一般的布置，在检查计划的贯彻与指导生产上，也缺乏深入检查与个别指导，以致不能掌握全面业务情况，有预见的、及时的提出问题解决问题，指导工作。三、在机关工作上也表现着忙乱被动与事务主义作风，思想领导不强。某些干部不安心工作，不钻研业务，新干部则存有雇佣观点。最后报告中详细分析了以上各种不良作风产生的根源，并指出了今后改进工作的办法，对各级领导与一般干部启发很大。
