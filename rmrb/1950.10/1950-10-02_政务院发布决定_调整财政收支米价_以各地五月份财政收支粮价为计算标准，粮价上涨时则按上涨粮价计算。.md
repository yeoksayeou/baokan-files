Xinhua News Agency, 30th. The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, in view of the gradual decline in grain prices across the country since May, and as of August, the average grain price in the six major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Chongqing has fallen by about 12 percent; while the prices of other goods, especially industrial products, have remained stable or even slightly increased, in order to safeguard the lives of government agencies, factories, troops, schools, salaried and supply system personnel, and the sound execution of the financial plans of government financial departments, has decided to adjust the fiscal revenue and expenditure grain prices, and implement them from October 1st of this year (those before October will be handled according to the original method). The main points of the measures are excerpted as follows:

　　I. Fiscal expenditures of all regions and departments, including employee wages, living expenses for supply system personnel, and economic construction investment, all of which are calculated in terms of grain, shall be based on the local fiscal grain price in May (No. 55 rice in Beijing, and the originally assessed fiscal revenue and expenditure grain price in other regions). In the future, no matter how much the grain price falls, the May fiscal revenue and expenditure grain price in each region shall be used as the calculation standard. When the grain price rises, it shall be calculated according to the rising grain price.

　　II. All fiscal revenue, including enterprise profits and taxes, which are calculated in terms of grain, shall also be handled in accordance with the preceding method. However, commodity taxes, customs duties, salt taxes, and other taxes that were originally levied ad valorem in currency shall continue to be levied ad valorem in currency according to the rate. Business and industrial taxes that were originally levied based on currency turnover shall also continue to be levied according to the rate based on currency turnover. However, when local financial authorities remit these tax payments, the conversion of currency into grain prices shall also be calculated according to the May fiscal revenue and expenditure grain prices.

　　政务院发布决定
    调整财政收支米价
    以各地五月份财政收支粮价为计算标准，粮价上涨时则按上涨粮价计算。
    【新华社三十日讯】中央人民政府政务院鉴于全国各地粮价自五月份以来渐趋下跌，截至八月份止，北京、上海、天津、汉口、广州、重庆六大城市粮价下跌，平均达百分之十二左右；而其他物品，特别是工业品的价格，则保持平稳状态，甚至略微上升，为保障政府机关、工厂、部队、学校、工薪及供给制人员生活及政府财务部门的财务计划健全执行起见，特决定将财政收支米价加以调整，并自本年十月一日起实行（十月以前者仍照原办法处理）。兹摘录其办法要点如下：
    一、各地区各部门的财政开支，包括职工工资、供给制人员生活费及经济建设投资在内，凡以粮食为计算单位者，均以当地五月份的财政粮食（北京五五米，各地区则为原来评定的财政收支粮价）为基数。今后不论粮食下降多少，均以各该地区五月份财政收支粮价为计算标准。上涨时则按上涨粮价计算。
    二、所有财政收入，包括企业利润和税收，凡以粮食为计算单位者，亦按前项办法处理。但货物税、关税、盐税及其他税收原按货币从价计征者，仍按货币从价依率征收。工商税原依货币营业额计征者，亦仍按货币营业额依率征收。惟各地财务机关上解这些税款时，其货币折合粮价也同样按五月份财政收支粮价折算。
