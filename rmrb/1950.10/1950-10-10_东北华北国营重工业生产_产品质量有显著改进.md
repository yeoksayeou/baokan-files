Xinhua News Agency report: State-owned heavy industrial factories in Northeast and North China have shown significant improvements in product quality in recent months; however, various improvement systems and measures still need to be further improved and implemented. In terms of steel, the qualification rate of Benxi Beishi Iron in June was 99.05%, while in April it was only 65.4%. In May, 19.13% of the pig iron products of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant were waste products, but there were no waste products in July. In July, the first-class product rate of the No. 2 branch of Tianjin Steel Plant reached 95%, an increase of 0.7 percentage points compared with June; fine wire has become all first-class products; and waste wire below No. 8 has decreased by 78% compared with June. In terms of machinery, 100% of the lathes manufactured by Northeast Machine Factory No. 1 in the first quarter were substandard, but the qualification rate reached 94% in the second quarter. The standard product rate of Andong Machine Factory also increased from 80% to 92% in June. In terms of electrical appliances, the waste and defective product rate of the three Northeast factories in the first quarter was as high as 40%. In May, the waste product rate dropped to 19%, and defective products were completely eliminated. Other improvements include the fineness of cement in Taiyuan Cement Plant in July and the quality of crude alkali in Hangu Chemical Branch in June.

The following measures were taken by various factories to improve product quality: First, a production responsibility system and a product inspection system were established. Many factories have also established shift handover systems to strengthen the connection between various departments. Some factories have also carried out mutual inspections and mutual assistance by workers according to the work process through contact contracts. Some factories have also reviewed the inspection standards in a timely manner to make them more appropriate.

Second, operating procedures were formulated, and technology was studied and improved. Some factories particularly emphasized the unity of technicians and workers, so that technicians truly have power and responsibility, and technical guidance can be better combined with quality inspection. The Northeast region has also established a technical responsibility system for this purpose. Most factories have established technical research associations to study operating procedures and delve into technology. More attention has been paid to the technical training of new workers than in the past. The apprentice contract has been further promoted.

Third, a reward and punishment system was established, and a rationalization proposal movement was launched. Some factories also adopted the method of daily exhibition of the worst and best products, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the workers to improve quality.

In addition, many factories have also learned from the work experience of the Ma Hengchang-style team according to the specific conditions of their factories and teams, which has also played a great role in improving quality.

At present, although the quality of heavy industrial products in Northeast and North China has improved, the quality level is still not very high in terms of the current quality standards, and there are still many shortcomings in the work of improving quality. For example, the inspection system in some factories is not sound, the inspection standards are not appropriate, and the operating procedures still have shortcomings; the sense of responsibility in some factories is not very clear; the reward system still has egalitarian tendencies, and the handling of rationalization proposals is not timely; the material selection and allocation in some factories is not good, etc.

Note: In the past, in the period of resuming production and in the production competition or the movement to create new production records, factories in Northeast and North China often emphasized quantity over quality, because output was easier to show achievements, resulting in a general phenomenon of low quality. For example, Anshan Iron and Steel Plant still ignored quality in the June competition, resulting in a 1.5% reduction in product quality compared with May. The phenomenon of low quality was serious. For example, all the lathes produced by Northeast Machine Factory No. 3 since April last year were substandard; the qualification rate of Beishi Iron produced by Benxi in February this year was only 27.6%. This situation has attracted attention from various places since this year and has been gradually improved, and it still needs to be further implemented.

　　东北华北国营重工业生产
    产品质量有显著改进
    【新华社讯】东北、华北地区国营重工业工厂产品质量，最近几个月来已有显著改进；但各项改进制度和办法尚须进一步健全与贯彻。钢铁方面，本溪贝氏铁六月份的合格率为百分之九十九点零五，而四月份时仅及百分之六十五点四。石景山生铁产品五月份有百分之十九点一三是废品，七月份已经没有废品。天津钢厂二分厂七月份粗丝一级品达百分之九十五，比六月份提高百分之零点七；细丝已全成一级品；八号以下的废丝比六月份已减少了百分之七十八。机器方面，东北机器一厂所制车床第一季百分之百不合标准，第二季合格率即达百分之九十四。安东机器厂六月份标准品亦自百分之八十增至九十二。电器方面，东北三厂第一季灯泡废品与次品率高达百分之四十，五月份废品率降至百分之十九，次品已完全消灭。其他如太原洋灰厂七月份的洋灰细度，和汉沽化工分厂六月份粗碱质量也有显著提高。
    各厂在改进产品质量中，曾采取了以下几个措施：第一是建立了生产责任制和产品检验制。不少工厂并建立了交接班制度，加强了各部门的联系。有的工厂还通过联系合同，按工序由工人互相检查，互相帮助。有的工厂更及时重审了检验标准，使之更为适当。
    第二是制定操作规程，研究并改进了技术。有些工厂特别强调了技术人员和工人的团结，使技术人员真正有职有权，使技术指导更好地和质量检查结合起来。东北区并为此建立了技术责任制。多数工厂都建立了技术研究会，学习操作规程，钻研技术。对于新工人的技术训练，已较过去重视。师徒合同更加推广。
    第三是建立奖惩制度，开展了合理化建议运动，有些工厂还采取了奖最坏和最好产品逐日展览的办法，大大鼓励了工人群众改进质量的积极性。
    此外，有许多工厂还按本厂本组具体情况学习了马恒昌式小组的工作经验，这对改进质量也起了很大作用。
    目前，东北、华北重工业产品质量虽有改进，但就现行质量标准来说，质量水平还不是很高的，而且在改进质量工作中还存在不少缺点。如有些工厂的检查制度还不健全，检验标准还不适当，操作规程还有缺点；有些工厂的责任制思想还不很明确；奖励制度还有平均主义偏向，对合理化建议的处理还不及时；有些工厂的材料选配还不好等。
    按：过去东北、华北各工厂在恢复生产时期以及生产竞赛或创造生产新纪录运动中，往往因产量易于表现成绩，大都重量不重质，以致造成质量普遍低劣的现象。如鞍山炼钢厂六月份竞赛中仍然忽视质量，以致产品质量比五月份反降低百分之一点五。质量不高现象严重者，如东北机器三厂去年四月开始生产的车床竟全部不合标准；本溪今年二月份所产贝氏铁的合格率也仅及百分之二十七点六。这种情形，今年以来已引起各地注意，逐步作了改进，现仍待继续贯彻。
