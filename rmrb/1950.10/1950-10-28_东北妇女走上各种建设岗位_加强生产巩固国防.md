Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang. Under the leadership of the People's Government and the Communist Party, women in Northeast China have displayed great patriotism and actively participated in the industrial and agricultural production and various construction projects of the new China.

Currently, there are more than 82,000 female workers engaged in industrial production in Northeast China; there are also many female staff members. In the units directly under the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, there are 19 female factory directors, 88 female assistant engineers, accountants, and technicians. Many female workers participate in construction with selfless spirit. Since the Industrial Department called for creating new production records last October, according to statistics from Shenyang, Andong, Jilin, Qiqihar and other four cities, 1,417 female workers have become outstanding advanced producers. Among them, Chang Yongfen, who attended the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, and Bi Yulan and Guo Guilan, labor models of Shenyang City, and Xin Guilan, labor model of Harbin City, are all outstanding figures in the new record creation movement. They improved operating methods, improved product quality and quantity, and shared their advanced experience with others, which improved everyone's production efficiency and promoted the new record creation movement. The People's Government also pays attention to training female technical talents in various work departments and schools. From last winter to June this year, more than 1,100 female technical workers have been trained in Fushun, Shenyang, Harbin and other places.

In the past year, the families of workers have also contributed a lot to national construction. Many family members have gradually established the concept of labor, managed household affairs well, enabled workers to go to work on time, and allowed them to get sufficient rest after work to ensure the completion of production tasks. For example, in order to ensure the completion of winter transportation tasks, the families of railway employees formed mutual aid groups last winter to wash and mend clothes for single workers, and helped sick family members and lying-in women to see doctors, buy medicine, and take care of housework, so that male workers would not be affected by family affairs and ask for leave or delay work. In addition, the families of workers actively participated in various production tasks of government and enterprise departments according to their needs. For example, making military uniforms, picking soybeans, and participating in municipal construction work such as cleaning garbage and planting trees; some families also participated in production such as pasting matchboxes, sewing sacks, and sieving gravel in combination with the needs of factories and mines. Railway worker families in Qiqihar, Jilin, Jinzhou and other places also participated in road protection work.

In terms of agricultural production, millions of rural women participated in agricultural labor. For example, in Huanan County, Songjiang Province, the number of women participating in agricultural labor this year accounted for about 80 percent of the total number of women capable of labor, an increase of 20 percent over last year. Farmers are enthusiastic about learning to plow, plant, drive carts, and filter manure. According to statistics from Lushun City, the number of women participating in plowing in spring plowing last year accounted for 0.29 percent of the total number of women participating in agricultural labor, and this year it has accounted for 8.7 percent. More than 1,100 women in the suburbs of Lushun and Dalian have learned to plow. In 1948, there was only one female tractor driver in Northeast China, and this year it has developed to 97. Many labor models have also emerged among women participating in agricultural labor. For example, among the representatives attending this National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, there are Guo Shuzhen from Liaoxi Province, Li Lanying from Rehe Province, and female tractor driver Liang Jun.

In addition to engaging in industrial and agricultural construction, Northeastern women also actively participate in various construction tasks. In the units directly under the Northeast People's Government and the units directly under the people's governments above the provincial, city, and district levels (excluding factory staff and trade department clerks), there are more than 11,300 female staff members; there are more than 16,000 female faculty and staff members working in large, medium, and primary schools, accounting for 15 percent of the total number of faculty and staff members.

　　东北妇女走上各种建设岗位
    加强生产巩固国防
    【新华社沈阳讯】在人民政府与共产党的领导下，东北地区广大妇女发挥高度爱国热忱，积极参加新中国的工业、农业生产及各项建设工作。
    目前全东北从事工业生产的女工有八万二千多人；女职员也很多。在东北人民政府工业部直属单位中，就有女厂长十九名，女助理工程师、会计师和技术员八十八名。许多女职工都以忘我的精神参加建设工作。从去年十月工业部号召创造生产新纪录以来，据沈阳、安东、吉林、齐齐哈尔等四个市的统计，就有一千四百十七名女工成为优秀的先进生产者。其中如出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的常永芬和沈阳市的劳动模范毕玉兰、郭桂兰，哈尔滨市的劳动模范辛桂兰等，都是创造新纪录运动中的杰出人物。她们改良了操作法，提高了产品的质量和数量，而且以自己先进的经验介绍给别人，使大家提高了生产效率，推动了新纪录运动。人民政府并注意在各种工作部门和学校中培养妇女技术人才，自去冬至今年六月，在抚顺、沈阳、哈尔滨等地，共培养了女技术工人一千一百余名。
    一年来，工人家属们对国家建设也贡献了不少力量。许多家属已逐渐树立起劳动观念，把家务管理好，使工人能按时上班，并使他们在下班后能得到充分休息，以保证生产任务的完成。例如铁路员工家属去冬为了保证完成冬季运输任务，成立了互助组，替单身工友洗补衣服，帮助有病家属和产妇请医生、买药和料理家务，使男工友不致因家事牵累而请假和误工。此外，工人家属们并根据需要，积极地参加了政府和企业部门的各种生产工作。例如做军衣、挑大豆及参加清垃圾、植树等市政建设工作；有些家属还结合厂矿需要，参加糊火柴盒、缝麻袋和筛石子等生产。齐齐哈尔、吉林、锦州等地的铁路工人家属并参加了护路工作。
    在农业生产方面，数百万农村妇女参加了农业劳动。例如松江省桦南县今年参加农业劳动的妇女约占能劳动妇女总人数的百分之八十，较去年增加了百分之二十。农妇们都热情地学扶犁、点种、赶车和滤粪。据旅顺市的统计：去年春耕参加扶犁的妇女占参加农业劳动妇女总数的百分之零点二九，今年已占百分之八点七。旅大郊区已有一千一百余名妇女学会了扶犁。一九四八年时，全东北只有一个女拖拉机手，今年已发展到九十七个。妇女们在参加农业劳动中也出现了许多劳动模范。例如出席这次全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的代表中，就有辽西省的郭淑贞、热河省的李兰英和女拖拉机手梁军等。
    东北妇女除从事工业、农业建设之外，并积极参加各项建设工作。在东北人民政府直属各单位及各省、市区人民政府以上的直属单位中（工厂职员及贸易部店员在外），即有女工作人员一万一千三百余人；在大、中、小学工作岗位上的女教职员有一万六千余人，占教职员总数的百分之十五。
