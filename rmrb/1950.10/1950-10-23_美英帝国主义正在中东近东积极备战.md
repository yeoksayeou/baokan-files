Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 18th: The Egyptian newspaper "Al-Ahram" reports that the British Ambassador to Cairo, Stevenson, will soon renegotiate Anglo-Egyptian relations with the Egyptian government. Britain demands to maintain and strengthen its military bases in Egypt, primarily in the Suez Canal area, as one of the necessary conditions for clarifying Anglo-Egyptian relations. U.S. and British air and naval bases are now scattered around all the Arab countries, as well as near Cairo and in the Suez Canal area. Existing air bases and airfields are currently being expanded to prepare for the landing and takeoff of heavy bombers and jet aircraft.

    The large military airport built by the Americans near Beirut in Hartha and in the Fayed area (Suez Canal area) has recently been completed. Many new airfields are under construction in Syria and Lebanon, in Transjordan and Saudi Arabia.

    U.S. and British imperialists are also carrying out large-scale preparations to turn the port of Aqaba (Transjordan), the ports of Tripoli and Haifa (Lebanon), the port of Haifa (Israel), and the port of Latakia (Syria) into their naval bases.

    U.S. and British strategic plans also stipulate the construction of a network of military strategic railways and highways within Israel, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iran. According to the Arab News Agency, the United States and Britain have obtained priority in road construction within these countries.

    These military and strategic fortifications are being constructed under the supervision of U.S. and British military experts. The Italian newspaper "Il Tempo" reported that the U.S. occupation army headquarters in West Germany, located in Frankfurt, received a special instruction from Washington this summer to prepare to dispatch the first group of five hundred U.S. military instructors to Lebanon and Syria.

    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社开罗十八日讯：埃及“阿赫拉姆报”报道：英国驻开罗大使斯蒂芬逊不久就要与埃及政府重新谈判英埃关系。英国要求保持并且增强在埃及的、首先在苏彝士运河地带的军事基地，作为澄清英埃关系的必要条件之一。美英的空军和海军基地，现已遍布阿拉伯东方所有各国的周围以及开罗附近和苏彝士运河地带。现有的空军基地与飞机场，目前都在扩充，以准备重轰炸机和喷气式飞机的降落和起飞。
    美国人在贝鲁特附近哈尔达地方和腓伊达区（苏彝士运河地带）构筑的大军用机场，最近已经完工。在叙利亚和黎巴嫩，在外约旦和沙特阿拉伯各地，有许多新飞机场正在建筑中。
    美英帝国主义者并且进行着大规模的准备工作，要把亚喀巴港（外约旦）、的黎波里港和海达港（黎巴嫩）、海法港（以色列）和拉塔基亚港（叙利亚）变成他们的海军基地。
    美英的战略计划并且规定要在以色列、伊拉克、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、土耳其和伊朗境内，构筑军事战略铁道和汽车公路网。据阿拉伯新闻局报道：美国和英国在这些国家境内取得了筑路的优先权。
    这些军事的和战略的工事，是在美英军事专家们的监督之下进行构筑。意大利《国家报》报道：设在法兰克福地方的西德美国占领军参谋部，今年夏天曾接到华盛顿的特别指令，准备派遣第一批五百名美国军事教官到黎巴嫩和叙利亚去。
