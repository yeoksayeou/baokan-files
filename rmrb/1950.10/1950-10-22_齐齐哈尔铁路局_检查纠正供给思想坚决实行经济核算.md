Qiqihar Railway Bureau
    Inspect, Rectify Supply Mentality, Resolutely Implement Economic Accounting
    [Our Qiqihar dispatch] During the rectification movement, cadres of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau clearly recognized that economic accounting is a crucial key to running an enterprise well. Everyone deeply regretted, saying: "In the past, we didn't engage in economic accounting, which caused irreparable losses to our work."
    In the past, leading cadres at all levels and all employees of the bureau generally harbored a supply mentality of actual reimbursement and a purely task-oriented viewpoint. When making budgets, lower levels were only afraid of not having enough, so they made broad estimates and asked for more to facilitate their own "flexibility"; upper levels blindly relied on lower levels without detailed review and research, but simply stamped their approval. Therefore, both upper and lower levels believed that asking for more was always better than asking for less, and as long as the task could be completed, they didn't care about accounting or not. When the Personnel Department of the bureau made its personnel budget this year, it asked the Northeast Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Railways for 8,000 people, and the office approved 5,000, but during the reorganization, it was discovered that there were many extra people. This situation shows that the leaders of the bureau not only lacked economic accounting thinking, but also had no clear idea of the numbers. Sun, the director of the Qiqihar Locomotive Depot, said: "In the past, the higher authorities only investigated how the task was completed and rarely asked about costs, which also affected the lower levels' disregard for costs and only focusing on completing the task." The bureau's past reward work was also regardless of cost, as long as the task was exceeded, rewards were given.
    Cadres of the bureau also reviewed their complacency during the rectification movement. For example, when the Iron Ox Movement was launched at the end of 1948, they were only satisfied with the status quo and failed to closely integrate the Iron Ox Movement with economic accounting. The cadres of the bureau did not study the experience of the new record movement in Northeast industry, believing that that set of experiences was not suitable for railways, thus making the Iron Ox Movement stagnate and failing to move forward in a new direction of economic accounting.
    Because the leading cadres of the bureau clearly recognized the importance of economic accounting during the rectification movement, the bureau has decided to reduce 614 billion yuan in the budget for the second half of the year, and make a more accurate production and financial plan. However, according to the bureau's income of 1,584 billion yuan and expenditure of 1,714 billion yuan in the second half of the year, the bureau will still have a deficit of 130 billion yuan in the second half of the year. Therefore, the bureau has called on all sub-bureaus to reduce costs, improve quality, eliminate deficits, and strive for profits. All sub-bureaus have put forward their own plans. The Qiqihar Sub-bureau discovered that there was a great waste of coal, water, and electricity in daily use, so it proposed to resolutely eliminate waste, practice strict economy, and implement the idea of economic accounting in the actual work of each station and section, and each employee, so that each unit can make its own production and financial plan, and everyone can learn to keep accounts. For example, the transportation department of the sub-bureau, after calculating the detailed accounts, proposed that it could increase revenue by 15 billion yuan in the second half of the year.

### 齐齐哈尔铁路局  检查纠正供给思想坚决实行经济核算

　　齐齐哈尔铁路局
    检查纠正供给思想坚决实行经济核算
    【本报齐齐哈尔讯】齐齐哈尔铁路局干部在整风运动中，明确认识了经济核算是办好企业的重要关键。大家很沉痛地检讨说：“过去我们没有搞经济核算，使工作受了不可弥补的损失。”
    在过去，该局各级领导干部与全体职工中，普遍存在着实报实销的供给思想与单纯任务观点。在做预算的时候，下边只怕不够用，宽打多要，便于自己“机动”；上边则是盲目的依赖下级，不加详细审核研究，而是盖章通过。因此，上下都以为多要总比少要强，只要能完成任务，不管什么核算不核算。该局人事处今年做人事预算时，向铁道部东北特派员办事处要八千人，办事处批准五千人，但在整编中发现多出很多人。这种情况说明该局领导者不仅没有经济核算思想，而且心中也没有数。齐齐哈尔机务段孙段长说：“过去上级只是追究任务完成如何，很少过问成本，这也影响到下边不管成本，只顾完成任务。”该局过去的奖励工作，同样也是不管成本，只要超过任务，就进行奖励。
    该局干部并在整风中检讨了自满情绪。譬如一九四八年末搞铁牛运动，只满足现状，未能把铁牛运动和经济核算紧紧的结合起来。该局干部对于东北工业中的新纪录运动的经验也不加研究，认为那套经验不适合铁路，因此使铁牛运动停滞不前，未能向经济核算的新方向前进一步。
    由于该局领导干部在整风中明确认识了经济核算的重要性，该局已决定在下半年预算中压缩六一四○亿元，做出比较精确的生产财务计划。但根据下半年该局收入一五八四○亿元，支出一七一四○亿元的情况来看，该局下半年还有一三○○亿元的赤字。因此，该局已向各分局号召减低成本、提高质量、消灭赤字、争取利润。各分局都提出了自己的计划。齐齐哈尔分局检查出日常用的煤、水、电有很大浪费，因此提出要坚决消灭浪费，厉行节约，把经济核算的思想，贯彻到每个站段、每个员工的实际工作中去，使每个单位都做出自己的生产财务计划，并使大家都学会算账。如该分局车务方面算一下细账，就提出下半年能增加收入一五○亿元。
