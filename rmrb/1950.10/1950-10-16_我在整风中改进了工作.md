　　I Improved My Work During the Rectification Campaign
　　Lulong County Committee, Yan Xin
　　My biggest shortcoming in the past was my careless attitude when carrying out work. Therefore, I couldn't discover problems when inspecting work; when subordinates raised questions, I would give empty answers. This was because I lacked practical experience. For example, I would say, "Discuss matters with the masses," but how exactly should one discuss with the masses? I myself was vague about it, so I couldn't explain it clearly to others. Only after studying the "mass line" did I deeply understand this point.
　　In this rectification campaign, we organized a 14-person work team to go to the countryside. This time, the work in the countryside was different from the past. In the past, cadres were scattered to various districts and assigned to guard their posts; after returning, each person would only report on their own work, thus providing little help to the district's work. We learned from this lesson, and all fourteen of us went to the Second District, covering twelve villages (two district cadres also participated). We focused on Zhao Guantun, conducting thorough inspections, discovering and solving problems, and creating point-and-area integration experience.
　　When carrying out the work, we used the evening chat opportunities with the villagers to understand the situation first. We also conducted in-depth investigations within the branch and among the village cadres. In two days, we discovered that the village branch was not united, the removed village chief Hu Cai had unclear accounts, and the land deeds were not yet completed; there was very little green manure pressed for the dependents of revolutionary soldiers, and one household of dependents had six mu of land lying fallow due to the irresponsibility of the substitute farmer; the village work was unmanaged and even came to a standstill.
　　After understanding these situations, we immediately convened the branch meeting and the village government committee. We didn't criticize the cadres first, as we did in the past, but first asked them about the difficulties in their work, pointed out the advantages and disadvantages of their work, and then discussed how to solve the problems. We first asked them to think of solutions, listen to their opinions, and inspire their enthusiasm. For the difficult questions raised by the village cadres, we didn't make conclusions first, but first sought their handling methods; at the same time, in order to solve the disunity of the branch, we conducted individual talks in advance, exchanged information, and discussed solutions. After ideological obstacles were removed, we convened a party member meeting to carry out criticism and self-criticism. We sincerely and cautiously gave them suggestions. The result of this work was that the problems were solved smoothly. The cadres and party members all accepted our opinions calmly and continued to work happily. When we solved problems, we first grasped the internal problems of the Party. Through discussions and resolutions of the village government committee, we solved some of the main problems in the village; in less than five days, we solved the problems that had not been solved within and outside the Party for two years (such as disunity, lack of enthusiasm for work, and cadre corruption).
　　This approach is much better than criticizing them as soon as you arrive in the village, pointing fingers and telling them how to do this and how to do that.
　　Not only did we do this in Zhao Guantun, but we also promptly convened小组长 [liaison] meetings or used correspondence to tell our experience to the other three groups. This enabled other comrades to learn new working methods. At the same time, I rode my bicycle and quickly passed on this working method to the Third and Fourth Districts. When we left the Second District, we convened a meeting of all district cadres to specifically explain our working methods in order to educate them.

　　我在整风中改进了工作
    卢龙县委  阎欣
    我过去有个最大缺点，便是在进行工作时采取马虎的态度，因此在检查工作时不能发现问题；遇见下级所提的问题，即很空洞地给以回答。这是因为我缺乏实际经验的缘故。比如我也会说“有事和群众商量”，究竟怎样去和群众商量呢？自己也模糊得很，所以也就无法对别人讲个清楚了。学习了“群众路线”后，我才深切体验了这一点。
    在这次整风中，我们组织了十四人的工作组下乡。这次的下乡与以往不同。过去只把干部很零散的分到各区，分兵把守；回来后只是由各人报告一下自己的工作情况，因此对区的工作没有多大帮助。我们接受了这个教训，十四个人都到二区，占了十二个村子（两个区干部也参加了）。并以赵官屯为重点，深入检查，发现问题解决问题，创造点面结合的经验。
    在进行工作时，我们利用晚上和老乡闲谈的机会先了解情况。在支部中，在村干部中我们也作了深入的了解。两天工夫，发现该村支部不团结，被撤职的村长胡才，账目不清，地照也未填完；抗属压绿肥很少，并有一户抗属由于代耕人不负责任，荒了六亩地苗；村中工作没人管，竟停顿下来了。
    我们了解了这些情况之后，即召开支部会、村政委员会。没像过去那样，先把干部批评一顿，而是先问他们工作中的困难，指出他们工作的优缺点，然后商谈如何解决问题。先叫他们想办法，听取他们的意见，启发他们的积极性。对村干提出的疑难问题，我们不先作结论，而先征求他们处理办法；同时为了解决支部不团结，事先进行个别谈话，交换情况与解决问题的办法。思想打通了，再召开党员会议，展开批评与自我批评。我们虚心地慎重地给他们出主意。这样工作的效果，就使问题顺利地解决了。干部党员们都心平气和地接受了我们的意见，并照常愉快地工作。我们解决问题时，先抓住党内问题。通过村政委员会讨论决议，解决了该村的一些主要问题；不到五天又解决了党内外两年来未解决的问题（如不团结、工作不起劲、干部贪污等问题）。
    这种作法，总比到村先批评一通，指手划脚的，这如何办，那如何办好的多。
    不但我们在赵官屯这样做，我们还及时召开小组长联席会或以通信方式，把我们的经验告诉了其他三个组。这就使其他同志学会了新的工作方法。同时我又骑着车子，将这个工作方法很快地传给了三、四区。当我们离开二区时，召开了全体区干部会议，具体讲解了我们的工作方法，以教育他们。
