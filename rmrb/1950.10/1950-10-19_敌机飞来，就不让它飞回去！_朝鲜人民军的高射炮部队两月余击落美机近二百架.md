Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 18th: The American invaders, relying on their "powerful" air force, have suffered heavy losses in the war of aggression against Korea. The young anti-aircraft artillery units of the Korean People's Army, under the battle cry of "If enemy planes come, don't let them fly back!", have shot down as many as 198 enemy aircraft of various types, led by B-29 "Superfortresses", in the first two months of the war.

According to Colonel Fang Wansheng, Director of the Air Defense Department of the General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army, who told reporters: "At the front, the People's Army anti-aircraft artillery units shot down a total of 128 enemy aircraft from June 25th to August 25th, including 23 B-29 bombers, 16 other bombers, 80 fighter planes, 7 fighter-bombers, and 2 reconnaissance planes. In the rear, the People's Army anti-aircraft artillery units shot down a total of 70 enemy aircraft from June 25th to September 20th, including 12 B-29 bombers, 43 fighter planes, 13 fighter-bombers, and 2 reconnaissance planes." Colonel Fang Wansheng explained: The statistics of downed enemy aircraft are compiled after going to the scene to retrieve the engines of the downed enemy aircraft, recording the enemy aircraft's numbers, and obtaining certification signed by the local Party committee.

Colonel Fang Wansheng said: Among the various branches of the Korean People's Army, the anti-aircraft artillery units are the youngest and were established later. Subsequently, with the stepped-up aggression of the American and Syngman Rhee gangs against the 38th parallel, the People's Army anti-aircraft artillery units rapidly grew and implemented unified command. A large number of university students with scientific knowledge enthusiastically joined the army. They transformed their hatred for the enemy into strength, and their fighting spirit was strong. On the one hand, they fought the enemy day and night; on the other hand, they consciously intensified their technical training, and in actual combat, they trained themselves to become excellent anti-aircraft gunners. Coupled with coordinated operations with various arms of the military, they achieved the aforementioned brilliant results.

Colonel Fang Wansheng said: The battle cry of the People's Army anti-aircraft artillery units is "If enemy planes come, don't let them fly back!" At the front and in the rear, the heroic People's Army anti-aircraft artillery units have countless inspiring heroic deeds. For example, when the American invading forces invaded Seoul, they first launched repeated attacks on the north bank of the Han River with formations of bombers and fighter planes. In order to prevent the enemy from crossing the river, the People's Army anti-aircraft artillery units displayed unparalleled heroism. Choi Jun-ho, a gunner of a certain anti-aircraft artillery detachment, gloriously sacrificed himself after continuously shooting down eight enemy aircraft. The gun commander immediately stepped up to replace him. When the gun commander fell, the squad leader and company commander took over the combat post one after another, enabling this anti-aircraft gun to continuously persist in combat for seven hours.

Among the anti-aircraft gunners of an anti-aircraft artillery regiment in the suburbs of Pyongyang, university students accounted for 80%. Although they had not been in the army for long, their shooting skills were already quite proficient. For example, Li Jichang's company shot down three enemy B-29 bombers and fourteen fighter planes in August alone. When enemy planes attacked on July 29th, they hit a pile of shells that had just been transported and had not yet been hidden. At this time, soldiers Wen Mingshu and Shen Zaihao rushed forward selflessly to rescue them. As a result, only two of the 135 shells exploded, 13 were burned, and the rest were saved.

Colonel Fang Wansheng finally told reporters with a strong belief in victory: "Our heroic commanders and gunners are coordinating with various arms of the military to defend the motherland's airspace, and the blows to the American aerial bandits will become greater day by day."

　　“敌机飞来，就不让它飞回去！”
    朝鲜人民军的高射炮部队两月余击落美机近二百架
    【新华社平壤十八日电】美国侵略者自恃为“强大”的空军，在侵略朝鲜战争中已遭受惨重损失。年青的朝鲜人民军高射炮部队，在“敌机飞来，就不让它飞回去！”的战斗口号下，在战争的头两个多月中，已击落以Ｂ二十九型“超级空中堡垒”为首的各型敌机一百九十八架之多。
    据朝鲜人民军总司令部防空部部长方万胜上校告记者称：“在前线，人民军高射炮部队从六月二十五日到八月二十五日，共击落敌机一百二十八架，计Ｂ二十九型轰炸机二十三架，其他轰炸机十六架，战斗机八十架，驱逐机七架，侦察机两架。在后方，人民军高射炮部队从六月二十五日到九月二十日共击落敌机七十架，计Ｂ二十九型轰炸机十二架，战斗机四十三架，驱逐机十三架，侦察机两架。”方万胜上校说明：击落敌机的统计数字，是经过到现场把被击落的敌机的引擎拿回来，把敌机的番号记下来、并经过当地党委签字证明后才列入统计表的。
    方万胜上校说：朝鲜人民军各兵种部队中以高射炮部队最为年轻，成立较晚。其后随着美李匪帮的加紧侵袭三八线，人民军高射炮部队才迅速地壮大起来，并实行了统一指挥。大批具有科学知识的大学生踊跃地参加部队。他们把对敌人的憎恨化为力量，战斗精神旺盛。他们一方面不分昼夜地对敌人作战，一方面自觉地加紧练习技术，在实际战斗中锻炼成为优秀的高射炮手，与各兵种部队的协同作战，获得了上述的辉煌战果。
    方万胜上校说：人民军高射炮部队的战斗口号是“敌机飞来，就不让它飞回去！”在前线，在后方，英雄的人民军高射炮部队都有着无数可歌可泣的英雄事迹。例如，美国侵略军队进犯汉城时，首先以大批轰炸机、战斗机编队轮番袭击汉江北岸。人民军高射炮部队为了阻止敌军渡江，发挥了无比的英雄主义精神。某高射炮区分队的瞄准手崔俊镐在连续击落敌机八架后光荣地牺牲了。炮长立刻上去代替他。炮长倒下去，小队长、中队长又相继接替战斗岗位，使这门高射炮不间断地坚持了七小时的战斗。
    平壤市郊区某高射炮联队的高射炮手中，大学生占百分之八十，他们参军的时间虽不久，但射击技术已相当熟练。如李基昌中队，在八月份一个月中就击落敌Ｂ二十九型轰炸机三架，战斗机十四架。七月二十九日敌机来袭时，射中了刚刚运来未及掩藏好的一堆炮弹，这时文明洙、沈在镐两位战士奋不顾身地跑过去抢救，结果一百三十五颗炮弹中只爆炸了两颗，烧着十三颗，其余的都保存下来了。
    方万胜上校最后以坚强的胜利信念对记者说：“我们英勇的指挥员和炮手，正配合各兵种部队作战，保卫祖国的领空，给予美国空中强盗的打击将一天比一天大。”
