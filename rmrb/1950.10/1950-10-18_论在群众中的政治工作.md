　　On Political Work Among the Masses
　　Wei Kuloyedov, Secretary of the Sverdlovsk Provincial Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)
　　*Editor's Note: Many comrades who commit the error of commandism can be said to have had good motives for their work initially. However, because they did not understand the methods of doing political work among the masses—that is, being good at persuading the masses, enabling them to recognize the correctness of the Party and the People's Government's policies from their own personal experience, and raising the masses to the level of the Party and the People's Government's policies—these policies of the Party and the People's Government can gain the support of the masses and guarantee their 100% implementation. Therefore, these people used commandism instead of persuasion to carry out their work. What is even more regrettable is that some people still do not recognize their mistakes in this way, but instead believe: "To implement policies, it is inevitable to offend the masses!" They completely and severely set the policies of the Party and the People's Government against the demands of the masses. This proves that these people fundamentally do not understand that these policies are precisely formulated based on the will of the broad masses, after elevation and concentration. Precisely because of this, when these policies are implemented among the masses, they must go through a certain amount of political work. Although this article discusses political work among the masses in the context of socialist construction, its spirit is equally applicable to the construction of a New Democratic society.*
    In the struggle to build communism, the Soviet people are achieving ever-changing successes. The inspirer and organizer of all the victories of the Soviet people is the Bolshevik Party—the vanguard of the working people, tempered in battle. The indestructible strength of the Lenin-Stalin Party lies in its close, inseparable, and ever-growing connection with the masses. The Bolshevik Party's policies, based on advanced Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory, are guided by the realization of a great goal: the construction of a communist society. To achieve this great goal, the Party is daily mobilizing, organizing, and inspiring the masses of working people.

    The main method the Party uses to lead the masses is the method of persuasion. Comrade Stalin taught: "To lead... that is, to be good at persuading the masses, to make them realize the correctness of the Party's policy, to put forward and implement such slogans; these slogans make the masses take the same view as the Party, make it easy for them to understand the correctness of the Party's policy based on their own experience, and raise the masses to the level of the Party's consciousness, thus guaranteeing the support of the masses and guaranteeing their determination to carry out a resolute struggle."

    Now, the task of the communist education of the working people is of particular importance. Our country is gradually transitioning from socialism to communism. Tremendous upsurges are occurring in all sectors of the national economy. There has been a huge qualitative advance in industry, and technological progress is also growing rapidly in factories in both light and heavy industries. Scientific achievements are increasingly and widely penetrating production. In agriculture, outstanding prospects are unfolding for the improvement of cultivation methods and the unprecedented growth of labor productivity, based on the advanced Michurin agricultural biological sciences and the increasing technological equipment of collective farm production.

    Under these conditions, the importance of political work among the masses is immeasurable. Party organizations should strive to fully unfold the outstanding prospects of communist construction before the broad masses of working people; to inspire the Soviet people to further engage in dedicated labor, and to use all methods to expand their creative spontaneity and initiative. The task of political work is to help the socialist competition for the completion and over-completion of various national economic plans, so that it can achieve further upsurges.

    Lenin said: "...The more profound the transformation we are to carry out, the more necessary it is to increase interest in it and a conscious attitude towards it, and to persuade new millions and tens of millions of people to recognize its necessity."

    Persuasion, patient explanation of the Party's policies to the masses, is the direct obligation of every Party leader, every Communist Party member. Without it, there is no hope of achieving any results in leading the masses.

    The success of agitation work depends first and foremost on the extent to which the Party's leading cadres and Soviet cadres actively participate in this work. With a certain theoretical preparation, they can more skillfully explain the policies of the Bolshevik Party to workers and collective farm members in reports or talks.

    Many facts can be cited to show that participation by Party workers in political agitation has yielded results. This is particularly evident in the example of the Party Committee of Serov City. Comrades Zalozenyev, Khugakov, and Parfenov, secretaries of the Municipal Committee, frequently made political reports and speeches at workers' conferences. This year, each of them made eleven to fifteen reports and speeches.

    The Municipal Committee organized a group of sixty-five leading workers as reporters and speakers. To answer the questions of the working people, evening gatherings are often held in various enterprises in the city. Questions are collected in advance in workshops and public dormitories, and these questions are answered by Party workers, teachers, engineers, doctors, and others. Hundreds of people attend such evening gatherings each time. Practice has shown that these evening gatherings are the most effective form of conducting political agitation and raising the cultural horizons of the working people.

    Daily and targeted political work among the masses has enabled the Serov Municipal Committee to more skillfully lead all sectors of economic and cultural activity. The city's Party organization has done a great deal of work in promoting the experience of production innovators, improving the quality index in industrial work, and improving safety techniques in metallurgical factories.

    Unfortunately, we still have some Party workers who shy away from political work among the masses and have lost contact with the masses. At the recent provincial Party conference, many facts were cited proving that some Party workers have no real contact with the masses, and that they use commandism instead of persuasion—the main method our Party uses to lead the masses.

    For example, Comrade Baranov, the former First Secretary of the Krasnouralsk Municipal Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), tried to lead the city's diverse life completely by relying on his own orders and instructions without leaving his office. He did not even go to the city's largest enterprises for several months. Naturally, he could not point out and support the new and progressive things that emerged in the enterprises. Communists could not see a political leader in this municipal Party secretary. Therefore, it is not surprising that everyone at the municipal Party conference voted against Comrade Baranov's candidacy for the new municipal committee organization.

    The leading workers of the Kamensk-Uralsky Municipal Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) also did not fully appreciate the importance of personally participating in the political work of the masses. Comrades Kochnev, Livadnekh, and Gavrilov, secretaries of the Municipal Committee, only went to enterprises to handle business matters, and generally did not talk to workers, nor did they make reports and speeches here.

    Because the Party's leading workers themselves avoided participating in political agitation, most of the working people in Kamensk-Uralsky could not be politically influenced on a daily basis. In many enterprises, agitation was limited to reading the newspaper and discussing production topics.

    The Provincial Party Committee has drawn the necessary conclusions from these facts. The main attention of the Municipal and District Committees should be on improving the political and ideological level of agitation work. This task can only be solved when the Party organizations at all levels are concerned daily with the selection and training of the cadres of agitators. Now there are 68,000 agitators in our province, more than 39,000 of whom are Communist Party members. About 3,500 of the agitators are leading workers, and 18,000 are representatives of the intelligentsia. More than half of the agitators have received higher and secondary education.

    This year, we have done more regular work on the study groups for agitators and leaders of collective agitation. In most cities and districts, agitators meet at least once every two months, and leading workers make reports at these meetings. They teach the agitators on the policies of our Party, the most important issues of the international situation, and explain to them the current tasks of the province, city, district, factory, and collective farm.

    Schools for agitators have been established in many large enterprises. In the Pyshminsk Electrolytic Copper Plant, 32 people are studying in such schools. Classes are held weekly. This year, the agitators have received a systematic series of speeches on theoretical issues, and several lectures and reports have been made on the international situation and the tasks of economic construction.

    The Provincial Committee insists that the secretaries of the primary Party organizations directly lead the study groups of agitators everywhere. This is important not only because the secretaries of the Party organizations are usually better prepared politically, but also because direct leadership of the agitators enables them to comprehensively study the lives, moods, and needs of the working people, to grasp new things, and to be familiar with all events and phenomena.

    However, the work of the agitators is not being carried out systematically everywhere. For example, in the Sukhoi Log district, the so-called "temporary instructions" (OneparwBka) method is used to replace the agitators' learning: that is, gathering the agitators together for a few minutes to announce the topics to be discussed in each meeting. All leadership of the agitators is limited to this. Obviously, under such circumstances, the role of political agitation is reduced.

    The main content of agitation should be to explain to the working people the superiority of the Soviet socialist system over the capitalist system, to cultivate their hatred for the increasingly disintegrated and decadent culture of bourgeois society, to expose the instigators of new wars, and to fight against the remnants of capitalism remaining in people's consciousness.

    Agitation does not simply mean explaining and calling on the masses to strive for various new achievements. Our agitation should have a fighting, offensive character. The duty of agitators is to always and everywhere boldly oppose everything that is outdated, against conservatism, against procrastination and bureaucracy. The more powerfully political agitation can oppose shortcomings in work, the more it can exert its practical effect, and the more it can help the development of criticism and self-criticism, which is a major method of educating cadres and educating the masses.

    The Party organizations in the province have cultivated a large number of experienced and skilled agitator cadres, tireless fighters for the cause of the Party. These agitators are highly respected among the people.

    Among such people, Comrade Churshinov, foreman of the Pervouralsk New Pipe Factory, can be cited as an example. He can be said to be a truly fiery Bolshevik agitator. Deep thoughtfulness and the ability to make people understand are the characteristics of his talks. Comrade Churshinov systematically reports to the workers in his work team on the domestic and international situation of the Soviet Union, and vividly explains the policies of the Communist Party and the Soviet government to them on the basis of various facts that every worker can approach and understand. The work team in which Churshinov conducts agitation ranks first in the factory's socialist competition. In the six months of this year, his work team over-fulfilled 260 tons of rolled iron, saving a large amount of metal, fuel, electricity, and lubricating oil.

    In addition to mass work in the workshop, Comrade Churshinov also frequently conducts talks in public dormitories. His work experience has been widely popularized in our province. The Provincial Publishing Bureau has specially published a booklet for him.

    The popularization and in-depth study of the experience of political agitation is the most important cause of the Party organization. For this purpose, the Provincial Committee of the Party held several provincial conferences this year of the best agitators in the metallurgical, coal, machine manufacturing industries, construction enterprises, transportation and agriculture. The popularized experience of agitation was then widely published in the province's newspapers and magazines "Reference Materials for Propaganda and Agitation Workers". In addition, booklets such as "Political Agitation in Enterprises in Sverdlovsk", "Agitation Workers in the Countryside", and "Material Evidence Agitation in Industrial Enterprises" were published.

    The strengthening of political work among the masses is the most important prerequisite for the various business achievements achieved by the Party organization in our province. Sverdlovsk City and the province's industry completed 101.6 percent of the task in the first half of the year. The formerly backward coal, electricity, copper mining and copper smelting industries have also improved their work and completed their production plans.

    In the province's collective farms and state farms, the sown area of ​​all crops has increased, and the number of public livestock has also increased significantly. Collective farms, state farms, and various sideline businesses can also complete all their tasks ahead of schedule for the state.

    The Party organizations in our province are using all methods to improve the level of mass political work among the working people. So that every urban and rural worker can hear the true Bolshevik words. So that the Bolsheviks in the province see this as a guarantee of various new achievements in economic and cultural construction.

　　论在群众中的政治工作
    联共（布）斯维尔德洛夫斯克省委书记  维·库洛耶多夫
    编者按：有许多犯强迫命令错误的同志，可以说，其中有一部分人，原来的工作的动机是好的，但是由于自己不懂得在群众中作政治工作的方法，就是要善于说服群众，使群众从自己的亲身经验中来认识党和人民政府的政策的正确性，把群众提高到党和人民政府政策的水平，这样，党、人民政府的政策，就可以得到群众的支持，可以保证其百分之百的实现。因此这些人不以说服办法而以强迫命令方法来进行了工作。更可惜的是有些人至今还不是这样去认识自己的错误，而是自以为：“要执行政策，就难免得罪群众！”十足地把党、人民政府的政策，和群众要求严重地对立起来。这就证明了这些人是根本不懂得：这些政策正是根据广大群众意志制定的，是经过了提高与集中的。正因为如此，这些政策要在群众中实行时，又必须经过一定的政治工作。这篇文章，虽然是就社会主义建设问题来论群众中的政治工作，但其精神同样适用于新民主主义社会建设问题的。
    在争取建设共产主义的斗争里，苏维埃人民正在获得日新月异的成就。苏维埃人民一切胜利的鼓舞者与组织者就是布尔什维克党——在战斗中锻炼起来的，劳动者的先锋部队。列宁、斯大林的党的不可摧毁的力量就在于它与群众的血肉相关、不可分离而复日益增长的联系。以先进的马克思、列宁革命理论为基础的布尔什维克党的政策，是以一个伟大目标之实现为其方针的，这一目标便是共产主义社会的建设。为了达成这一伟大的目的，党逐日地在动员、组织和鼓舞劳动者群众。
    党领导群众所用的主要方法就是说服的方法。斯大林同志教导说：“领导……这就是说，善于说服群众，使他们认识到党的政策的正确性，提出并施行这样的一些口号；这些口号使群众采取与党同样的看法，使他们易于根据自身的经验，而体会到党的政策的正确性，把群众提高到党的自觉的水平，这样便可以保证获得群众的支持并且可以保证使他们决心进行坚决的斗争。”
    现在，劳动者共产主义教育的任务更有其特别的重要性了。我们的国家正在逐步地从社会主义过渡到共产主义。在国民经济的一切部门中都在发生着巨大的高涨。在工业中有了巨大的质量上的推进，而在各轻重工业的工厂里，技术上的进步也在猛烈地成长着。各项科学上的成就越来越广泛地深入生产。在农业中，以前进的米邱林农业生物科学与日益增长的集体农庄生产技术设备为基础的耕种法的提高与劳动生产率空前的增长的卓越的远景正在展开。
    在这些条件之下，群众中政治工作的重要性便难以计量地在增长着了。党组织应该朝着这方面来努力：即要能在劳动者广大群众面前充分地展开了共产主义建设的一些卓越的远景；鼓舞苏维埃人民使他们能更进一步地从事于献身的劳动，使他们能用一切的方法来展开他们创造的自发性与积极性。政治工作的任务就是要帮助为争取各项国民经济计划的完成与超额完成的社会主义竞赛，使它获得进一步的高涨。
    列宁说过：“………我们所要进行的改造越是深刻，那就越发需要提高对于它的兴趣和自觉的态度，并且说服新的成百万的人们，和成千万的人们，使他们认识到它的必要”。
    党的政策中对群众的说服，耐心的解释是每一个党的领导者，每一个共产党员的直接义务。没有它的话就休想在群众的领导工作上获得什么成果。
    鼓动工作的成功与否首先就要看参加这种工作的党的领导干部和苏维埃干部是积极到什么程度。有了一定的理论上的准备以后，他们便可以更能熟练地在报告或谈话中向工人和集体农庄庄员解释布尔什维克党的政策。
    可以列举出不少因党的工作者的参加政治鼓动而获得了成果的事实。这特别可以在党的谢洛夫市委会的例子上看出来。市委会书记扎洛日涅夫同志、胡加科夫同志和帕尔非诺夫同志经常地在工人大会上做政治报告和演讲。今年他们每一个人都做了十一次到十五次的报告和演讲。
    市委会里由六十五位领导工作者组织了一个报告者和演讲者的集团。为了解答劳动者们的问题，常常在该市的各企业里举行晚会。问题是预先在各车间与公共宿舍中搜集起来的，这些问题均由党工作者、教员、工程师、医师等来回答。这样的晚会每次总有成百的人们参加。实行的结果显示出来，这些晚会是进行政治鼓动和提高劳动者们文化的眼界的最有效的形式。
    在群众中逐日的，并且是向着一定目标迈进的政治工作使谢洛夫市委会能更加熟练地领导所有经济与文化活动的各部门。该市的党组织在生产革新者经验的宣传上，在工业工作中质量指数的提高上，在冶金工厂中安全技术的改善等上面都做了许多工作。
    可惜我们仍然有一些畏避群众中的政治工作，失去了对群众联系的党的工作者，在不久以前召开的省党会议上便举出了多数的事实；这些事实证明：有一些党的工作者与群众是没有切实联系的，证明他们是用了命令主义来代替了说服的方法——我党领导群众所用的主要方法。
    举例来说，前联共（布）克拉斯诺乌拉尔市委会第一书记巴拉诺夫同志曾试图不离开他的办公室，而完全依仗着自己所发的命令与指示来领导该市多种多样的生活。他甚至好几个月也不到市内最大的各企业那里去，这样，他自然也就不能指出并支持在各企业中所产生的那种新的、进步的东西了，共产党员们在这个市委书记身上已看不到是一个政治领导者。因而市党会议上大家反对投市委会新组织候选人巴拉诺夫同志的票也就毫不足怪了。
    联共（布）加明斯克·乌拉尔市委会的领导工作者们也没有充分地估计到亲身参加群众政治工作的重要性。市委会书记科乞涅夫同志、李瓦德内赫同志和加乌里洛夫同志只是到各企业去料理业务上的事情，一般是不和工人们谈话，也不在这里做报告和讲演。
    由于党的领导工作者本身回避参加政治鼓动，这就使加明斯克·乌拉尔的大部分劳动者不能逐日地受到政治的影响。在许多企业中间，鼓动仅仅是限于读读报纸，就生产上的题目大家谈谈而已。
    党的省委会便从这些事实中得出了必要的结论。各市委会与区委会的主要注意力应该在于提高鼓动工作的政治思想水平。只有在党的各组织每日都关心到鼓励工作者干部的选择和培养的时候，这一任务才能获得解决。现在在我们的省里有六万八千名鼓动工作者，其中有三万九千多名是共产党员。鼓动工作者中大约有三千五百人是领导工作者，一万八千人是知识分子的代表。鼓动工作者一半以上是受过高等和中等教育的。
    今年对鼓动工作者和集体鼓动的领导者的各研究组，我们做了较有规律的工作。在大部的市与区里，每两月至少有一次鼓动工作者的集会，在这集会上由领导工作者来做报告。他们就我党政策，国际形势的最重要的若干问题对鼓动者加以教导，并向他们解释省、市、区、工厂和集体农庄当前的各项任务。
    在许多大企业中创设了鼓动工作者的学校。在培施明施克的电解制铜工厂里有三十二个人在这样的学校里学习。课业是每周进行的。本年对于各鼓动工作者，曾就各理论上的问题做了一整套有系统的演说，并且就国际情势和经济建设的各项任务也做了几次讲演和报告。
    省委会坚持要使各基层党组织的书记在各处直接领导鼓动工作者的研究组。这事之所以重要不仅仅是因为党组织的书记照例在政治上是有较大准备的人，还因为是对鼓动工作者直接的领导使他们能够全面地研究劳动者的生活、心情与需求，能捉得住新的东西，能熟悉所有的事件与现象。
    但是对鼓动者的工作并非是到处都在有系统地进行着。例如在苏赫洛日区，便以施行所谓“临时指示”（OneparwBka）的方法来代替鼓动工作者的学习：那就是把鼓动工作者聚集在一起几分钟，为了是向他们宣布各次所要进行的谈话的主题。一切对鼓动工作者的领导便仅限于此了。显然地，在这样的情形之下，政治鼓动的作用便降低了。
    鼓动工作中的主要内容，应该是要向劳动者们解释苏维埃社会主义制度对于资本主义制度的优越性，培养他们对于资产阶级社会的日益解体的、腐败堕落的文化的憎恨，揭发新战争的挑拨者，并且和存留在人们意识中的资本主义残余进行斗争。
    鼓动，这不单单是意味着解释，和号召群众去争取各种新的成果。我们的鼓动应当带有战斗的、进攻的性质。鼓动工作者的职责就是永远并且到处大胆地反对一切已不合时宜的东西，反对墨守陈规，反对因循拖延和官僚主义。政治鼓动的工作越是能有力地反对工作中的缺点，那么它也就越能发挥它的实际效果，也就越能有助于批评与自我批评的展开，而这种批评却正是教育干部、教育群众的一种主要的方法。
    党在省内的各组织培植了多数有经验的、熟练的鼓动工作者干部，为了党的事业而不知疲倦的斗士。这些鼓动工作者在人民中间受到崇高的尊敬。
    在这样的一些人中间，可以举出别尔沃乌拉尔新铁管工厂的工长楚尔希诺夫同志做例子。他可以说是一位名符其实的火焰般的布尔什维克鼓动工作者。深刻的思想性与善于使人领会的能力是他的谈话的特色。楚尔希诺夫同志有系统地向自己作业班的工人们报告苏联国内与国际的情势，并且就每一个工人所能接近、所能理解的各种事实，向他们鲜明地阐述共产党与苏维埃政府的政策。楚尔希诺夫进行鼓动工作的那个作业班，在工厂的社会主义竞赛中占着第一位。在今年的六个月中间，他那个作业班超计划完成的有二百六十吨辗铁，节省了大量的金属、燃料、电力和润滑油料。
    除去了车间内的群众工作以外，楚尔希诺夫同志又经常地在各公共宿舍中进行谈话。他的工作经验已在我省中广泛地普及开来。省出版局为他曾特别出版了一个小册子。
    政治鼓动经验的普及与深切的研究，是党组织最重要的事业。以此为目的，党的省委会在今年便举行了几次冶金、煤炭、机器制造各工业、各建设企业、运输业与农业中最优秀的鼓动工作者的全省会议。鼓动工作的被普及了的经验其后广泛地被发表在省内各报纸和杂志“宣传与鼓动工作者参考资料”上面。除此以外，又出版了“斯维尔德洛夫斯克市各企业中的政治鼓动”、“乡村鼓动工作者”、“工业企业中实物证明的鼓动”等小册子。
    群众中政治工作的加强，是我省党组织所达成的各种业务上的成就的最重要的前提。斯维尔德洛夫斯克市和省的工业在上半年便完成了任务的百分之一百零一点六。在过去落后的煤炭、电力、铜矿与冶铜各工业部门也改善了自己的工作，并且完成了各项生产计划。
    在省内的集体农庄和国营农庄里，一切作物的播种面积都增加了，公有牲畜的头数也显著地增加了。集体农庄、国营农庄和各种副业经营也都能对国家提前完成一切自己的任务。
    我省党组织正采用着一切方法在劳动者中间提高群众政治工作的水平。使每一个城乡劳动者都能够听到真实的、布尔什维克的言语。使省内的布尔什维克在这一点上看到经济与文化建设中各项新的成就的保证。
