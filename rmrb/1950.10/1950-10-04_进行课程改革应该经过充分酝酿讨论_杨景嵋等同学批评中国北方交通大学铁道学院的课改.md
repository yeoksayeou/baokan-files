To the Editors:

　　We are students of the Beijing Railway Institute of Northern Jiaotong University. Our school is currently undergoing curriculum reform. This curriculum reform was not sufficiently prepared and deliberated beforehand, causing emotional fluctuations among students, which deserves serious attention. I am reporting the situation to you in the hope that you will help resolve it.

　　Our school grew out of the educational traditions of semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China. There are many unreasonable aspects in the curriculum that need to be reformed. Last semester, many students felt that the "Railway Management" course lacked focus and their future prospects were unclear, so they were not settled in their studies. This problem has not been well resolved. Therefore, before the start of this semester, many students wanted to transfer to other departments or institutes.

　　Seeing this situation, the institute did not adequately solicit students' opinions or analyze the reasons why students wanted to transfer. Instead, it consulted with the university and the Ministry of Railways and announced that the "Transportation Department" would be changed to the "Transportation Engineering Department" in order to persuade students not to transfer. Lin, the director of the Transportation Department, and others then convened a department meeting to discuss and study the issue of curriculum reform. However, the conditions for this "department change" were not mature. Professors and students lacked sufficient ideological deliberation, and it was hastily decided a week before the start of classes without careful consideration and detailed discussion.

　　We believe that this way of conducting curriculum reform is not good. Curriculum reform is not such a simple and easy matter and should be carried out in a more planned and step-by-step manner. It is said that our new curriculum was revised with reference to the curriculum of Harbin Institute of Technology, and Harbin Institute of Technology learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Therefore, some people say that this is very appropriate. However, they did not consider that the specific circumstances of our school are different from those of Harbin Institute of Technology: Harbin was liberated earlier and can invite Soviet experts to lecture, while we cannot. At the same time, the establishment of new courses at Harbin Institute of Technology must have been after long-term consideration and full preparation.

　　Such a hasty curriculum reform caused confusion in the students' minds. Some students expressed satisfaction with this curriculum reform, believing that learning engineering is better than learning management, because they can master technology; but they are also unclear about the future of the Transportation Engineering Department. Some students lack confidence in the new curriculum, feeling that the courses are too heavy and the scope is too broad (the basic courses of the Civil Engineering Department, the Electrical Engineering Department, and the Mechanical Engineering Department must be learned), and they are afraid they will not learn well. Some expressed opposition, saying: "I want to study management, not engineering." And everyone did not have a unified opinion on whether the courses for the third and fourth grades should be changed (now the institute has decided to carry out a unified reform - Editor). Therefore, students cannot concentrate on their studies. Some professors also believe that the Transportation Management Department also has its importance and should not be changed to an Engineering Department.

　　We believe that the administrative department of our institute should bear the main responsibility for this matter; and the university and the Ministry of Railways did not have enough understanding of the situation of our institute, which is also a reason. If things continue to develop like this, the consequences will be bad. We hope that the relevant parties will pay attention.

　　Editor's note: Since many courses at the Beijing Railway Institute of Northern Jiaotong University cannot meet the needs of the new China's construction, it is absolutely necessary to implement planned and step-by-step reforms. However, before the reform, there must be full deliberation and discussion to achieve consensus among teachers and students in ideology. Item 4 of the "Decision on the Implementation of Curriculum Reform in Higher Education Institutions" of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government stipulates that in curriculum reform, "it must be carried out after careful consideration and multi-faceted discussions, and must not be carried out rashly." Because only in this way can the reform be carried out truly effectively without causing emotional fluctuations among some students. We hope that the authorities of the Beijing Railway Institute of Northern Jiaotong University will pay attention to the reflections of students like Yang Jingmei and others, deeply understand the situation of the students, and seek a unified understanding through full discussion in order to end the emotional fluctuations of some students.

　　进行课程改革应该经过充分酝酿讨论
    杨景嵋等同学批评中国北方交通大学铁道学院的课改编辑同志：
    我们是中国北方交通大学北京铁道学院的学生。目前我们学校里正在进行课程改革。这次课程改革事前准备酝酿不够，使同学们情绪发生波动，值得严重注意。我把情况反映给你们，希望你们帮助解决。
    我们学校是从半封建半殖民地的旧中国的教育传统中生长起来的，课程中有许多不合理的地方，需要改革。在上学期，有许多同学觉得学“铁路管理”功课没有重心，毕业后前途不明确，因而不安心学习。这个问题一直没有很好解决。因此，这学期开学前，有许多同学要转院转系。
    院方看到这种情况，没有很好征求同学意见，分析同学所以要转院的原因，就和校部、铁道部商谈，宣布把“运输系”改成“运输工程系”，以争取同学不转院转系。运输系林主任等便召开系会，讨论、研究课程改革问题。但是，这次“改系”条件是不成熟的，教授和同学在思想上都缺乏充分的酝酿，没有经周密考虑和详细讨论，便在开学上课前一个星期匆匆决定了。
    我们认为：这样进行课程改革是不好的。课程改革不是这样简单、容易的事，应该更有计划有步骤地进行。据说，我们的新课程是参考哈尔滨工业大学的课程改的，而哈尔滨工业大学则是向苏联的先进经验学习的。因此，有人说这是很妥善的。但是，他们却没有考虑到我校与哈尔滨工业大学的具体情况不同：哈尔滨解放较早，可以请到苏联专家讲课，而我们却不能。同时哈尔滨工业大学设立新课程，一定是经过长期考虑和充分准备的。
    这样轻率的课程改革，便在同学的思想上引起了紊乱。有的同学对这次课程改革表示满意，认为学工程比学管理好，可以掌握技术；但他们对运输工程系的前途也是不明确的。有的同学则对新的课程缺乏信心，觉得功课太重、范围太广（土木工程系、电机工程系、机械工程系的基本课程都要学），恐怕学不好。有的正面表示反对，说：“我是要学管理的，不是要学工程的。”而三四年级的课程改不改的问题，大家也没有一致的意见（现在该院已决定统一进行改革——编者）。因此，同学们学习就无法安心了。有些教授也认为运输管理系也有其重要性，不应改成工程系。
    我们认为：我院行政上对这件事情应该负主要责任；而校部、铁道部对我院情况了解不够，也是一个原因。事情再发展下去，后果是不好的。希望有关方面加以注意。

    编者按：中国北方交通大学北京铁道学院既有许多课程，不能符合新中国建设的需要，实行有计划有步骤的改革，是完全必要的。但在改革前必须充分酝酿讨论，使师生在思想上取得一致。中央人民政府教育部“关于实施高等学校课程改革的决定”第四项规定：在课程改革时，“必须经过深思熟虑和多方面的讨论，决不可轻率从事”。因为只有这样，才能真正有效地进行改革、而不致引起某些同学的情绪波动。我们希望中国北方交通大学北京铁道学院的当局注意杨景嵋等同学的反映，深入了解同学们的情况，经过充分讨论求得一致的认识，以终止部分同学的情绪波动。
