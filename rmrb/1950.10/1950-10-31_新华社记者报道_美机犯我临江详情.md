Xinhua News Agency Report

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tonghua, 29th—Our agency reporter reports the following details regarding the US military aircraft's intrusion and strafing of Linjiang County, Liaodong Province, on October 25th: At 7:25 AM on October 25th, four US aircraft intruded into the airspace over Erdaogou Village, Weishahe District, Linjiang County. At that time, Wang Xiantang, a 16-year-old child from the village, was driving an ox cart on the main road outside the village, and Lao Lutou, a pedestrian from a neighboring village, was talking with Wang Xiantang beside the cart. They suddenly saw four US aircraft flying towards them. Lao Lutou immediately prostrated himself by the roadside, but Wang Xiantang did not have time to jump off the cart. One US aircraft swooped down and strafed the ox cart, severing the halter rope in Wang Xiantang's hand. A second US aircraft followed immediately and strafed again, two bullets hitting Wang Xiantang's left leg and the root of his left thigh. The wound on his leg was seven inches long, his left heel was pierced, and a small hole was pierced in the upper part of his left ear by shrapnel. Six bullets hit the ox's head and chest, killing it instantly. After being wounded, Wang Xiantang fell to the side of the road against the wall of a civilian house. A third US aircraft continued to frantically strafe the ox cart, destroying it completely. The road beside the cart was filled with bullet holes about five inches deep.

　　After strafing the area, the four US aircraft intruded into the airspace over Sandaogou Village, Weishahe Village, Daliuzi, Xiaoliuzi, Wangjianglou, and other places nearby. At 7:50 AM, they flew to the airspace above Linjiang County, circling and reconnoitering our railway station and buildings, and at 7:54 AM, they fled into North Korean territory.

　　The four US aircraft intruded into our territory for a length of 15 kilometers from north to south and about 125 kilometers from east to west. Residents of Erdaogou Village, which was strafed, have recovered more than 20 bullet casings marked (DM45), (SL45), (LC43), etc., and nine unexploded bullets. They also found a rectangular iron plate measuring one and a half inches long and wide that fell from the aircraft, which had a machine gun drawing and English instructions on how to use the heavy machine gun firing device, and was marked "Made by HA Manufacturing Corporation, New York." All of these items have been photographed by our local people's government.
