　　Many Women in the Second District of Beijing
    Actively Participate in Night School Studies
    Deeply Appreciate the Benefits of the Communist Party, Sincerely Thanking Chairman Mao.
    [Report from our newspaper] Wang Fan, from the Women's Work Group of the Second District of Beijing, reports: Many adult women in the Second District of Beijing, having gained the opportunity to study culture after liberation, actively participate in night school studies and deeply experience the benefits of the Communist Party, sincerely thanking Chairman Mao.
    The Women's Work Group of the district, in order to mobilize women to participate in celebrating National Day, convened a night school representatives meeting on September 29th, attended by 98 representatives from 14 night schools. Many representatives spoke enthusiastically. In their speeches, they described the entire process and experience of how they persuaded their families, against the opposition of their mothers-in-law and husbands, to gain the opportunity to study. For example, Zhou Ruiming from the Third Cultural Center said: "I dropped out of school at thirteen and got married at fourteen, and I was always a submissive daughter-in-law until after liberation when night schools were established, and I had the opportunity to study again. But when I signed up, my family didn't like it, my mother-in-law frowned, and my husband said, 'Why are you still studying at your age!' The children also made a lot of noise to stop me. But no matter what, I still tried my best to go to school. I am very interested in learning social development history at school, and when I go home, I explain it to my family. At the same time, when I come home from school, I always help my family with work first, instead of just picking up a bowl and eating; I do the family's clothes at night. In this way, I gradually changed my family's views." Wang Yuzhang from the elementary class of Guangningbo Street Night School said: "We are all older people, some are already in their thirties or forties. If we were in a wealthy family in the past, we would have graduated from university long ago. Today, our seven- or eight-year-old children can go to school because we have caught up with the good era of Chairman Mao, while the times we caught up with when we were young were the unlucky era of Japanese devils and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Taking ourselves as an example, if the Communist Party hadn't come, we probably wouldn't have had the opportunity to study in our lifetime. So, sisters, we should study hard and not quarrel with our mothers-in-law and husbands, but use peaceful methods to change their minds. Only in this way can we be worthy of the concern of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for us." Some representatives were excited and grateful in their speeches, and couldn't help but shed tears. They deeply felt that today's happiness was given by Chairman Mao, and they should deeply thank Chairman Mao. Nie Baolan from Women's Third Middle School Night School said: "At the March 8th meeting this year, I made up my mind to participate in learning and boldly proposed it to my aunt, and as a result, the two of us participated in the night school together."

　　京市二区不少妇女
    积极参加夜校学习
    深切体会到共产党的好处，由衷地感谢毛主席。
    【本报讯】北京市二区妇女工作组王凡报道：京市二区不少成年妇女由于解放后获得了学习文化的机会，积极参加夜校学习，并切身体验到共产党的好处，由衷地感谢毛主席。
    该区妇女工作组，为动员妇女群众参加庆祝国庆节，曾于九月二十九日召开了夜校代表会议，出席十四个夜校的代表共九十八人。不少代表热情发言。在发言中，叙述了自己怎样在婆婆丈夫反对上学的情形下，最后说服了家庭，争取到学习机会的整个过程和经验。如第三文化馆周瑞明说：“我十三岁失学，十四岁结了婚，一直就当着顺服的媳妇，直到解放后成立了夜校，我才又有了学习的机会。但在报名时，家里不喜欢，婆婆挂着脸；丈夫也说：“你这么大年纪还学个啥呀！”孩子们也七嘴八舌的乱阻拦。但是，不管怎样，我还是尽量想法上了学。在学校学社会发展史很有兴趣，回家后就给家里人讲解，同时上学回家后，总先帮着家里人做活，而不是回家就端碗吃饭；家里的衣服晚上打夜做。就这样慢慢地把家里人的看法转变过来了。”广宁伯街夜校初级班的王玉璋说：“咱们都是上了年纪的人，有的已三、四十岁，要是过去的有钱人家早都大学毕业了，今天咱们七、八岁的孩子就能上学，是因为赶上了毛主席这个好时代，而咱们小时候所赶上的却是日本鬼子和国民党反动统治的倒霉时代。拿咱们自己来说，今天要不是共产党来了，咱们恐怕一辈子也没有学习机会。所以姊妹们应好好学习，也不要与婆婆、丈夫吵闹，要用和平的办法去转变他们的脑筋。只有这样，才对得起共产党、毛主席对我们的关切。”有的代表在发言中兴奋、感激，忍不住流了眼泪。她们深深地感到：今天的幸福是毛主席给予的，应该深深地感谢毛主席。女三中夜校聂宝兰说：“在今年三八节的会上，我就下了决心要参加学习，大胆向大姑提了出来，结果两人一块儿参加了夜校。”
