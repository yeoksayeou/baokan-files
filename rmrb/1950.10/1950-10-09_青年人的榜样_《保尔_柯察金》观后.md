　　A Role Model for Young People
    ——After Watching "Paul Korchagin"
    Yang Hanqing

    The famous Soviet writer Nikolai Ostrovsky's original work, adapted into a play by Bandarenko as "How the Steel Was Tempered," also known as "Paul Korchagin," has been performed by the China Youth Art Theater at the Youth Palace for a long time, and has been warmly welcomed by all sectors, especially the broad masses of young people.

    Paul Korchagin is a typical figure of a Soviet young revolutionary fighter. Under the banner of Stalin, he fought selflessly, loved his country, loved the people, and served the Party and the people wholeheartedly.

    Every achievement of the new Soviet society was a joy to Korchagin, and every difficulty and obstacle was an object of Korchagin's heroic struggle. He dedicated himself to revolutionary work with boundless enthusiasm.

    Whether in times of war or peace, Korchagin lived and fought intensely. His spirit never slackened. For example, the work of Paul Korchagin and his comrades in building a narrow-gauge railway to transport fuel in order to save the city of Kyiv from freezing and starvation was so moving.

    It was a very desolate place. It goes without saying that food and lodging were difficult, and even the materials for building the railway were particularly scarce. Coupled with bandit harassment and wind and snow, the difficulties were indescribable. However, their will to build the railway was so firm that no difficulty could hinder their work. Whether day or night, they worked intensely. In their arduous struggle, they finally won victory.

    Paul Korchagin was not only courageous in struggle and good at work, but also studied diligently and loved useful books as much as he loved his own life. Therefore, although Paul Korchagin had not attended any school, his knowledge was very profound.

    Paul Korchagin once had such a great idea when mourning a comrade who sacrificed himself for the revolution: the most precious thing for a person is life, and we only have one life. A person's life should be lived well and should be dedicated entirely to the revolutionary cause. He indeed dedicated his entire life and energy to the most magnificent cause in the world. After losing his sight, he still insisted on working, even if only his heart and brain were left, he still had to fight. As a result, he truly became a great writer.

    Young friends! We should learn from Paul Korchagin's example, ignite the blazing fire of youth, and charge towards all the difficulties and obstacles on the road of New Democracy. At present, our War of Liberation has not yet completely ended, our construction work is just beginning, and our tasks are arduous.

    In order to protect and consolidate the fruits of victory we have obtained through arduous struggle, and in order to create lasting world peace, every young person must live and fight like Paul Korchagin.

　　青年人的榜样
    ——《保尔·柯察金》观后
    杨汉卿
    苏联名作家奥斯托洛夫斯基原著、由班达连柯改编成剧本的“钢铁是怎样炼成的”，又名“保尔·柯察金”，已由中国青年艺术剧院在青年宫公演很久了，受到了各界特别是广大青年的热烈欢迎。
    保尔·柯察金是苏联青年革命战士的典型人物，他在斯大林旗帜下，忘我地战斗，热爱祖国，热爱人民，忠心耿耿地为党、为人民服务。
    苏联新社会的每一件成就，都是柯察金的快乐，每一个困难和障碍都是柯察金英勇搏斗的对象。他以充沛的热情献身于革命工作。
    无论在战斗时期或在和平时期，柯察金都是紧张地生活着，战斗着。他的精神从来没有松懈过。例如在为了使基辅城免于冻饿而修筑一条狭轨铁路，以便输送燃料时，保尔·柯察金及其同伴们的工作，是多么感动人呀。
    那是非常荒凉的地方，不用说食宿都感困难，连修筑铁轨的材料也特别缺乏。加上匪帮的袭扰，风雪交加，困难是无法形容的。但是，他们修筑铁轨的意志是那样坚定，任何困难都阻碍不了他们的工作。不管白天或黑夜，他们都紧张地工作着。他们在艰苦的奋斗中，终于赢得了胜利。
    保尔·柯察金，不但勇于斗争，善于工作，而且孜孜不倦地学习着，热爱有益的书本正像热爱自己的生命一样。所以保尔·柯察金虽然没有进过什么学校，但他的学问却很渊博。
    保尔·柯察金，曾经在哀悼一个为革命牺牲的同志时，有过这样一个伟大的意念：一个人最宝贵的是生命，而生命于我们只有一次。一个人的生命应当好好地度过去，应该把全部生命献给革命事业。他的确把整个生命和精力，都献给了世界上最壮丽的事业了。眼睛失明后，他还是坚持工作，那怕就只剩下心脏和脑子，也还要奋斗。结果，果然成为一个伟大的著作家了。
    青年朋友们！我们应该学习保尔·柯察金的榜样，燃烧起融融的青春之火，向着新民主主义道路上的一切困难和障碍冲锋。目前我们的解放战争还未完全结束，我们的建设事业正在开始，我们的任务是繁重的。
    为了保护和巩固我们从坚苦斗争中得来的胜利果实，为了创造世界持久的和平，我们每一个青年人都必须像保尔·柯察金一样地生活着，战斗着。
