　Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, October 25th: Newspapers in Germany, Hungary, and Bulgaria have successively commented on the statement of the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the eight countries, including the Soviet Union, Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania.
　　The German Socialist Unity Party's newspaper, Neues Deutschland, stated: The German people warmly support the statement of the Eight Foreign Ministers' Conference because they know that the proposals of the Eight Foreign Ministers' Conference are just and their starting point is to believe that the reconstruction of a unified and democratic Germany is inextricably linked with the cause of defending peace.
　　The Hungarian Workers' Party's newspaper, Szabad Nép, commented: Every peace-loving country and every people who hope to avoid the scourge of war support the statement of the Eight Foreign Ministers.
　　The Bulgarian Fatherland Front newspaper wrote: The Prague Declaration exposed the aggressive designs of the American and British imperialists and mobilized the peace and democratic forces of the world to oppose them.
　　Xinhua News Agency, October 28th: According to TASS, Moscow: The Pravda published Naumov's Berlin dispatch on the 26th, commenting on the reaction in Germany to the statement of the Eight Foreign Ministers' Conference, stating: The statement of the Eight Foreign Ministers' Conference fully exposed the true meaning of the New York meeting of the United States, Britain, and France, making it clear to every German that the hypocritical declaration of "ending the state of war" conceals a conspiracy to prolong the occupation and a conspiracy to intensify the dragging of West Germany into the Atlantic aggressive bloc. At present, the working people of the German Democratic Republic are warmly welcoming the statement of the Eight Foreign Ministers' Conference. At the meetings held in many industrial enterprises, they unanimously declared that they would wage a resolute struggle to realize the Prague resolutions.
　　The author continued: The American puppet Bonn gang and their masters believe that the Prague statement is a fatal threat to them. They clearly realize that if the people of West Germany know the eight-nation proposal, their tricks to poison the people of West Germany will be completely bankrupt. Therefore, for several days, they have mobilized the entire West German newspapers and radio stations to prevent the people of West Germany from learning the truth about the Prague Conference.
　　The author concluded: However, matters concerning the survival of the country cannot be concealed from the German people. The truth about the eight-nation proposal broke through the dyke of lies fabricated by the war-mongering servants and promoted the development of the West German movement for peace and unity. The specific program for the struggle for peace and unity in Germany put forward in the statement of the Eight Foreign Ministers' Conference will arm all patriotic elements in West Germany.
　　Xinhua News Agency, October 28th: According to a Deutsche Nachrichten-Agentur dispatch from Berlin on the 28th, quoted by TASS: The Central Committee of the Free German Youth League has issued a statement stating: The statement of the Prague Conference of the Eight Foreign Ministers pointed out the path to unification and peace for Germany, and the youth of all Germany firmly support the proposals in the statement. German youth do not want war, and West German youth do not want to be mercenaries and shed blood. The mass movement against the remilitarization of West Germany and against the decisions of the US, British and French imperialist New York Conference has been widely launched in West Germany. The statement finally called on members of the Youth League to carry out work so that every German can know the content of the proposals in the statement of the Eight Foreign Ministers' Conference.

　　德匈保等国报纸评论
    一致拥护八国外长会议声明
    德国人民决为实现决议进行坚决斗争
    【新华社二十八日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙二十五日讯：德、匈、保三国报纸纷纷评论苏、德、波、捷、匈、罗、保、阿尔巴尼亚八国外长会议的声明。
    德国统一社会党机关报新德意志报称：德国人民热烈拥护八国外长会议的声明，因为他们知道八国外长会议的建议案是正义的，其出发点就是认为：重建统一和民主的德国是与保卫和平事业不可分地联系着。
    匈牙利工人党机关报自由人民报评称：全世界每一个爱好和平的国家与每一个希望避免战祸的人民，都是八国外长声明的后盾。
    保加利亚祖国阵线报写道：布拉格声明揭露了美英帝国主义者的侵略图谋，并动员全世界和平民主力量来反对它们。
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：二十六日的真理报发表了瑙莫夫的柏林通讯，评述八国外长会议声明在德国的反应称：八国外长会议的声明，充分揭露了美英法三国纽约会议的真正意义，使每个德国人民明了：伪善地宣布“结束战争状态”一举，包藏着延长占领的阴谋，包藏着加紧将西德拖入大西洋侵略集团的阴谋。目前德意志民主共和国的劳动人民正热烈欢迎八国外长会议的声明，他们在许多工业企业举行的集会上，一致宣布要为实现布拉格决议而进行坚决的斗争。
    作者继称：美国傀儡波恩伙帮及其主子们，认为布拉格声明对他们是致命的威胁。他们清楚地觉察到，如果西德人民知道了八国建议，便将使他们毒害西德人民的诡计彻底破产。因此他们数日来便把整个西德的报纸和电台动员起来，阻止西德人民得知布拉格会议的真相。
    作者结语称：然而，关系国家存亡的事情是瞒不过德国人民的。八国提案的真相冲破了战争贩子仆从们一手捏造的谎言的堤防，推动了西德争取和平与统一的运动向前发展。八国外长会议声明提出的争取德国和平与统一的具体纲领，将武装起西德的一切爱国分子。
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十八日电引德意志通讯社消息：自由德国青年联盟中央委员会顷发表声明称：八国外长布拉格会议的声明，为德国指出了走向统一和平的道路，全德国青年坚决拥护声明中的建议。德国青年不要战争，西德青年不要当雇佣兵而流血，反对西德重新军事化，反对美、英、法帝国主义纽约会议决定的群众运动，已在西德广泛展开。声明最后号召青年联盟盟员进行工作，使每个德国人都能知道八国外长会议声明的建议内容。
