    【Our Newspaper】The reburial ceremony of the remains of General Zuo Quan, former Deputy Chief of Staff of the Eighteenth Group Army, and martyrs Yang Yumin, Zhang Hengyu, He Yun, Gao Jiecheng, Lai Qin, Chen Guanghua, who gloriously sacrificed themselves in the War of Resistance Against Japan, will be held in Handan today. The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Martyrs' Cemetery will also hold its inauguration ceremony on the same day. Representatives from the Central People's Government, the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, the North China Military Region, the Hebei Provincial Government, and other party, government, and military units, as well as family members of the martyrs, will attend the public memorial service at the cemetery.
    General Zuo Quan was martyred in 1942. At that time, the Kuomintang reactionary government had moved from "passive resistance" to "sitting and watching." Only the Chinese Communist Party led the people of the whole country to resist the Japanese invaders under extremely difficult conditions behind enemy lines. The Japanese invaders also used most of their forces to deal with the anti-Japanese battlefield behind enemy lines. General Zuo Quan, an outstanding member of the Chinese Communist Party and a senior general of the Eighteenth Group Army, went to the front line to supervise the battle and died for his country. Martyr Zhang Hengyu, who died at the same time, was the secretary of the Political Power Work Department of the Northern Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party. Martyr He Yun was the president of the North China Xinhua Daily. Martyr Chen Guanghua (formerly Jin Changhua) was the organizer and leader of the Korean youth who participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan. In addition, Martyr Yang Yumin was the director of the Political Department of the Jidong Anti-Japanese Allied Army, and Martyrs Gao Jiecheng and Lai Qin were the presidents of the Jinnan Bank, all of whom died in the War of Resistance Against Japan. At that time, due to the war environment, the remains of General Zuo Quan and Martyr Yang Yumin, etc., were temporarily buried in Shimen Village, Shexian County.
    Due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the united resistance of the military and civilians across the country, and the heroic sacrifices of countless revolutionary martyrs like General Zuo Quan, the Chinese people defeated the ferocious Japanese imperialism. The people will always remember these loyal patriots who defended the motherland, selflessly sacrificed themselves, and shed their blood. In 1946, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Council decided to build a martyrs' cemetery in Handan and rebury the remains of General Zuo Quan and other martyrs.
    Over the past four years, under the direct supervision of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government, the North China People's Government, and the Central People's Government, the construction of the Handan Martyrs' Cemetery has been completed this autumn. The remains of General Zuo Quan and other martyrs have also been carefully moved from Shexian County to Handan by a specially formed relocation committee.
    【Our Newspaper】The State Council of the Central People's Government sent a telegram to the Hebei Provincial People's Government and transferred it to the Handan Prefectural Commissioner's Office for the relocation committee for the reburial of General Zuo Quan, the telegram is as follows:
    On the occasion of the reburial of Comrade Zuo Quan, we hereby express our deep respect and mourning. The spirit of General Zuo will live forever.
          State Council, October 7th
    The Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government and the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee wrote elegiac couplets and elegies for the reburial of General Zuo Quan and the completion ceremony of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Martyrs' Cemetery as follows:
    Martyrs will live forever!

　　左权将军等烈士灵柩移葬
    今在邯郸举行移灵典礼
    中央人民政府等单位代表前往公祭
    晋冀鲁豫烈士陵园落成典礼同时举行
    【本报讯】在抗日战争中先后光荣牺牲的前十八集团军副总参谋长左权将军及杨裕民、张衡宇、何云、高捷成、赖勤、陈光华等烈士移灵典礼，今日在邯郸举行。晋冀鲁豫烈士陵园同日举行落成典礼。中央人民政府、中国人民革命军事委员会、华北军区、河北省府等党、政、军各单位代表及烈士家属等多人均前往陵园举行公祭。
    左权将军是在一九四二年牺牲的。当时国民党反动政府已由“消极抗战”到“坐以观战”，只有中国共产党率领全国人民在敌后极艰苦的条件下抗击日寇。而日寇也以其大部分兵力对付抗日敌后战场。中国共产党优秀党员、十八集团军高级将领左权将军亲临前线督战，以身殉国。同时牺牲的张衡宇烈士是中国共产党北方局政权工作部秘书，何云烈士是华北新华日报社社长，陈光华烈士（原名金昌华）是参加抗日战争的朝鲜青年的组织者与领导者。此外，杨裕民烈士是冀东抗日联军政治部主任，高捷成、赖勤烈士是冀南银行行长，都先后在抗日战争中牺牲。当时左权将军及杨裕民烈士等的灵柩因战争环境，都暂时安葬在涉县石门村。
    由于中国共产党正确的领导，由于全国军民的团结抗日，也由于千万像左权将军一样的先烈们的英勇牺牲，中国人民战胜了凶恶的日本帝国主义。人民永远纪念着这些忠贞捍卫祖国、奋不顾身、洒尽自己热血的先烈。一九四六年晋冀鲁豫边区参议会决议在邯郸修建烈士陵园，并移葬左权将军等烈士的灵柩。
    四年来先后经过晋冀鲁豫边区政府、华北人民政府及中央人民政府的直接督促，邯郸烈士陵园修建工程至今秋已告完竣，左权将军等烈士灵柩也由专门组成的移灵委员会慎妥地由涉县移到邯郸。
    【本报讯】中央人民政府政务院为左权将军移灵致电河北省人民政府转邯郸专署转移灵委员会，电文如下：
    际此左权同志移灵安葬，谨电表示深切的敬意与哀思。左将军的精神永垂不朽。
          政务院  十月七日
    中央人民政府最高人民法院、中共中央华北局为左权将军移灵及晋冀鲁豫烈士陵园落成典礼撰送挽联挽词如下：

      中央人民政府最高人民法院敬挽
        左权将军千古
    艰苦勇毅，奋战太行。万千英豪敬效模，英雄事业播神州。为革命牺牲，精神与日月长存。
