　　【Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing Dispatch】Autumn grain collection work has begun in various parts of the Southwest, and farmers are eagerly paying, fully demonstrating their love for the motherland and the People's Government. In most areas of the four administrative regions of Eastern Sichuan, Southern Sichuan, Western Sichuan, and Northern Sichuan, the autumn grain collection work has entered the stage of publicity, mobilization, investigation, and assessment, and it is estimated that it will be completely completed by the end of November. The provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang are also about to begin.

　　Farmers in various parts of the Southwest have been very active in paying grain from the start. For example, farmers in Northern Sichuan said, "This year, first, the harvest is good, second, the amount of public grain is less than last year, and third, the method is fair. We want to pay public grain early and reduce rent early." Yanting County in Northern Sichuan has already completed its collection task due to the active payment by farmers. In Jiangbei County, Eastern Sichuan, most farmers are now drying and cleaning their grain, waiting for notification to deliver it to the granary. In order to make the public grain burden more fair and reasonable, farmers in various places are actively investigating hidden land under the leadership of the People's Government. Neijiang County in Southern Sichuan recently uncovered a lot of hidden land, and the number of acres increased by 25% compared to the number of acres reported during the collection of public grain in 1949.

　　In addition, some areas have also seen biases in their work, such as assessing burdens based on this year's bumper harvest yield rather than the normal annual yield, and simply seeking to complete the task, underestimating the yield, and not daring to boldly calculate and collect according to the rate. These biases have been corrected by local leading organs.

　　西南各地开始秋征农民踊跃缴纳公粮
    少数地区曾发生评产不实等偏向，已经各地领导机关纠正。
    【新华社重庆电】西南各地秋征工作已开始，农民正踊跃缴纳，充分表现了对祖国，对人民政府热爱。川东、川南、川西、川北四行政区的大部地区秋征工作都已宣传动员进入调查评议，估计十一月底可完全结束。云、贵、西康等省也即将开始。
    西南各地农民缴粮一开始就很积极，如川北农民说：“今年一来年景好，二来公粮数目比去年少，三来办法公平，我们要早缴公粮早减租。”川北区盐亭县由于农民积极缴纳，且已完成了征收任务。川东区江北县多数农民现在都将粮食晒干捡净，等着通知送缴入仓。为使公粮负担更加公平合理，各地农民在人民政府领导下积极进行查黑田。川南区内江全县最近查出很多黑田，田亩数比一九四九年征收公粮时自报的田亩数增加了百分之二十五。
    此外，少数地区工作中也发现了不按常年产量，而按今年丰收产量评议负担和单纯只求完成任务、低估产量而不敢大胆依率计征等偏向，这些偏向都已经当地领导机关纠正。
