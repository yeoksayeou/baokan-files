　　Our Goals for Future Endeavors
　　Industrial Model Worker Representatives Zhen Rongdian, Li Yong, Yang Fuchun
　　In the thousands of years since China was founded, we have never heard of a national conference of workers, peasants, and soldiers. On the day of the meeting, we met our greatest and most beloved Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao shook hands with us so kindly and intimately that we were too excited to speak. Chairman Mao, with his radiant face, shone upon us as warmly as the winter sun.

　　Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and other leaders instructed us to learn from the broad masses of the people, to avoid arrogance and complacency. We must ensure that we come from the masses and go to the masses.

　　Although the Chinese revolution has achieved a basic victory, our war of liberation is not yet over, and our construction endeavors are just beginning. In the future, we must make even greater efforts to: First, completely eliminate the remaining bandits and liberate Taiwan and Tibet. Second, unite with the people of the whole country to struggle together. Third, further restore and develop production, launch production competitions, implement economic accounting systems, create new records, and invent new tools and machines to further improve production. Fourth, study politics, culture, and technology. Fifth, oppose American imperialist aggression and defend world peace.

    工业劳模代表  甄荣典、李永、杨福春
    中国立国数千年以来也没有听说过全国工农兵在一起开会，在开会的那天，我们和最伟大的最敬爱的毛主席见了面，毛主席那么慈祥亲切地和我们握手，使我们激动的说不出话来，满面红光的毛主席，好象冬天的太阳一样和煦地照着我们。
    毛主席、朱总司令和各位首长指示我们，要向广大人民群众学习，不骄傲，不自满，我们一定要作到从群众中来，到群众中去。
    中国革命虽然已经取得了基本的胜利，但是，我们的解放战争还没有结束，我们的建设事业还正在开端，今后我们必须更进一步的努力，要做到：一、彻底消灭残匪，解放台湾、西藏。二、和全国人民团结起来共同奋斗。三、进一步恢复与发展生产，展开生产竞赛，实行经济核算制，创造新纪录，和发明新的工具和机器，把生产提高一步。四、学习政治、文化和技术。五、反对美帝侵略，保卫世界和平。
