    Xinxiang Special District, Pingyuan Province
    Summarizing the Summer Grain Collection and Deploying the Autumn Grain Collection
    Various Localities Adopt Appropriate Measures to Prevent Bias and Achieve Results
    [This newspaper, Xinxiang News] The Xinxiang Special District of Pingyuan Province achieved significant results in this year's summer grain collection; however, some biases that occurred during the summer collection should be addressed and overcome in the autumn grain collection. Except for Xinxiang and Yanjin counties, where a portion of the summer grain tax is still outstanding, all other counties in the special district have completed 100% of their tasks, and some counties have even exceeded their quotas. However, after thorough investigation, it was found that in some villages, during the summer grain collection, cadres still exhibited work styles of trying to save effort, fearing trouble, being careless, and violating policies. For example, some villages privately allocated grain quotas, increasing the burden on the people, which occurred most frequently in Meng County, Yanjin County, and Yuanyang County. Some villages did not seriously implement the regulations for rewarding newly cultivated land, and newly cultivated land that had not reached the burden-bearing period was also assigned burdens. Some villages improperly reduced or exempted taxes and levies due to disasters, or, due to selfish departmentalism, reduced the area of land and lowered yields. Furthermore, some villages did not adequately take care of the families of martyrs, soldiers, cadres, and impoverished households of widowers, widows, orphans, and the disabled. In order to implement policies, correct biases, further improve the level of cadres, overcome the simple task-oriented view and one-sided mass viewpoint, and establish an overall concept and national concept, to lay a good foundation for the autumn grain collection, the special district criticized the above biases at the summer grain collection summary meeting, and pointed out that these biases must be resolutely corrected in conjunction with the preparation for the autumn grain collection. Over the past month, various localities have achieved certain results. For example, in Bo'ai, due to improper disaster relief last autumn, the masses paid new taxes while owing old ones, resulting in arrears. This time, after correct disaster relief measures, 20,000 jin of old loan grain and 25,000 jin of outstanding public grain have been recovered. Jixian County's Chengguan District has cleared its arrears. The phenomenon of private allocation of public grain in 37 villages in Meng County is also being corrected; villages with the most additional allocation and significant problems are being dealt with according to the severity of the circumstances. For example, the village chiefs of Dongxiaoqiu Village in the Fourth District and Yinjiaya Village in the Second District have been sent to the county to study policies and receive education, so that they can recognize and correct their mistakes. Yuanyang First and Fourth Districts convened village cadre meetings, using policies to enlighten the cadres' thinking. Songliuyuan in the First District and Dasanli Village in the Fourth District reported 2,056 mu of unregistered land. In three villages of Jixian County, 156 mu of newly cultivated land were assigned burdens. In addition to returning 4,345 jin of public grain, those households who should have paid but were indeed in difficult circumstances were also granted deferred payment through democratic discussions by the masses. The result of these actions is that the masses have responded well, and at the same time, it has provided a good example for balancing burdens and completing tasks in the future.

    平原省新乡专区
    总结夏征布置秋征
    各地采取适当办法防止偏向收到成效
    【本报新乡讯】平原省新乡专区今年的夏征工作，曾获得显著成绩；但在夏征中发生的若干偏向，应该在秋征工作中注意克服。该专区除新乡、延津两县夏征公粮尚有一部尾欠外，其余各县均百分之百完成任务，有些县还有超过了任务。但经深入检查，发现部分村庄在夏征中，仍存在着干部图省事、怕麻烦、粗枝大叶与违犯政策的作风。如：有些村庄私派公粮，加重人民负担，这在孟县、延津、原阳等县发生最多。有的村庄不认真执行奖励新开荒地的规定，不到负担年限的新开荒地，也派了负担。有的村庄对灾情减免不当，或由于自私本位，缩小地亩，降低产量。还有些村庄没有适当照顾烈、军、干属及鳏、寡、孤、独贫苦困难户。为了贯彻政策，纠正偏向，进一步提高干部水平，克服单纯任务观点和片面的群众观点，树立整体观念和国家观念，给秋征打下良好基础。该专区在夏征总结会议上，对上述偏向作了批判，并指出必须结合秋征准备工作，坚决纠正这些偏向。一月来各地已收到一定成效。如博爱去秋因减灾不当，群众交了新的，拖下旧的，造成尾欠。这次通过正确减灾后，已收回旧贷粮二万斤、尾欠公粮二万五千斤。汲县城关区已扫清尾欠。孟县三十七个村发生私派公粮现象，亦着手进行纠正；对加派最多、问题较大的村，则分别情节轻重处理。如四区东小仇村及二区殷家凹村村长，即经调县学习政策，进行教育，使能认识并改正错误。原阳一、四区召开了村干会，用政策打通干部思想，一区宋柳园，四区大三李村两村自报黑地二千零五十六亩。汲县三个村新开荒地派负担的有一百五十六亩，除退还公粮四千三百四十五斤外，对应交纳但确系家境困难户，也通过群众民主讨论，予以缓征。这样做的结果，群众反映良好，同时也给今后平衡负担、完成任务提供了良好的范例。
