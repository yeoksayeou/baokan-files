Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 19th. Shandong Province has launched its new cotton procurement work, with a reasonable cotton-grain price ratio. The state-owned Shandong Cotton Yarn and Fabric Branch Company purchased a total of 75,725 dan of cotton in September, exceeding the original procurement plan. At the beginning of the procurement work, the cotton price was relatively high due to the decline in grain prices. After appropriately increasing grain prices and purchasing large quantities, the cotton-grain price ratio has become more reasonable. For example, in Dezhou Prefecture, a major cotton-producing area in Shandong Province, when the new cotton entered the market, one jin of lint cotton could be exchanged for more than eleven jin of millet. After adjustment by the local state-owned trading company, by mid-September, it generally maintained a ratio of one jin of lint cotton to nine jin of millet. Initially, there was also a phenomenon of excessively low cottonseed prices in the price ratio between lint cotton and cottonseed. After the Cotton Yarn and Fabric Branch Company gradually increased cottonseed prices from the end of August, the price ratio between lint cotton and cottonseed has now become more reasonable. The Cotton Yarn and Fabric Branch Company entrusts cooperatives in rural areas to purchase cotton at the company's listed price, so that the majority of cotton farmers can sell cotton at reasonable prices at any time, ensuring the smooth completion of the cotton procurement task. For example, a total of 124 village cooperatives in Dezhou Prefecture, which operate purchasing services on behalf of the company, have purchased 30 percent of the total amount of new cotton purchased by the company. Cotton merchants in major cotton distribution centers such as Dezhou, Lianzhen, and Pingyuan have also formed joint operations under the unified leadership of the local industry and commerce departments.

　　山东开展购棉工作
    棉粮比价已趋合理
    【新华社济南十九日电】山东省开展新棉收购工作，棉粮比价合理。国营山东花纱布分公司九月份共收购棉花七万五千七百二十五担，超过原订收购计划。收购工作开始时，由于粮价下跌，致棉价相对偏高，经适当提高粮价并大量收购后，棉粮比价已趋合理。如山东省主要棉产区德州专区新棉登市时，每斤皮棉换小米十一斤以上，经当地国营贸易公司调整以后，九月中旬一般已保持一斤皮棉换小米九斤的比率。开始时也发生皮棉与籽棉比价中籽棉价格过低的现象，经花纱布分公司自八月下旬起逐渐提升籽棉价格后，目前皮棉和籽棉的比价已趋合理。花纱布分公司在农村中委托合作社按公司牌价收购棉花，使广大棉农可按合理价格随时卖出棉花，保证了购棉任务的顺利完成。如德州专区经营代购业务的村合作社共计一百二十四处，为公司代购新棉的数量已占全部购棉总数百分之三十。德州、连镇、平原等棉花主要集散地的棉商，也已在当地工商部门的统一领导下，进行联营。
