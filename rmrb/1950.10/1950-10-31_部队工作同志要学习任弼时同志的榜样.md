Comrades Working in the Military Must Learn from Comrade Ren Bishi's Example
    Chen Yi
    On October 27th, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sorrowfully announced the passing of Comrade Ren Bishi. This was a shocking piece of news for the entire Party and the military, immediately and universally causing comrades to grieve. After a period of great sorrow, everyone turned to deeper remembrance and longing, as if they couldn't believe that Comrade Bishi had truly left us! But how painful it is! The official obituary from the Central Committee of the Party: The great warrior and statesman of the Chinese people, Comrade Ren Bishi, has indeed bid farewell to us!
    In the thirty years of the great Chinese revolutionary struggle, we can recall the indelible contributions left by Comrade Bishi from various aspects. This requires a large and immortal biography to recount him. Here, I will only briefly mention one aspect. As a political worker in the military, Comrade Ren Bishi also left an excellent model. This is worthy of our remembrance and study! Comrade Bishi served as the political leader of the Sixth Army Corps in the Hunan-Jiangxi region, as the political commissar of the Second Front Army formed by the meeting of the Second and Sixth Army Corps, and as the director of the General Political Department of the Eighth Route Army during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Comrade Bishi held three positions, precisely during the extremely difficult years for the Chinese People's Army. For example, when Comrade Bishi arrived in the Hunan-Jiangxi area in the summer of 1933, it was an independent working environment, surrounded by enemies on all sides, and the base area was gradually shrinking. Comrade Bishi was ordered to lead the Sixth Army Corps in a westward breakout, meeting with the Second Army Corps commanded by Comrade He Long at the intersection of Hunan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Hubei, resolutely protecting the interests of the people, and continuing to fight against powerful enemies. Afterwards, he was ordered to embark on the Long March, taking the route through the borders of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Xikang provinces, heading north to join the Fourth Front Army commanded by Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and then continuing north to Shaanxi to join Chairman Mao and the First Front Army. For a full three years, the troops spent their time in constant breakouts; the arduousness of the struggle was unprecedented, and it was the most serious test for the Chinese People's Army, especially for the leaders of the troops. Comrade Bishi, like other Long March leaders of our Party, victoriously withstood this test. This was the greatest contribution to the Chinese people. Because during the Long March, surrounded by enemies on all sides, intercepted and blocked by enemies, any slight deviation in the political leadership and military actions of the troops could cause irreparable losses, and even lead to the destruction of the troops. If a successful breakout could not be achieved during the Long March, and the Chinese People's Army could not be preserved, then the subsequent development of the Chinese revolution would have taken a different form. This shows the importance of leading the Long March through difficulties. The model left by Comrade Bishi in this regard is his principled approach and self-sacrificing spirit in his work. This is something that the Chinese people will always remember him for!
    In the current period of New China's construction, we are encountering the aggression launched by American imperialism. In order to stop the aggression and safeguard peace, all comrades of the People's Liberation Army should stand at their posts and undertake the sacred task of consolidating national defense. Comrade Bishi is precisely a good example, and we should learn from him and commemorate him by completing the glorious task of national defense!

　　部队工作同志要学习任弼时同志的榜样
    陈毅
    十月二十七日中共中央悲痛地宣布任弼时同志逝世。这是一个惊动全党全军的消息，立即普遍地引起同志们的哀痛。大家在一阵巨大的哀痛之后，转为更深沉地默记和想念，又不相信弼时同志真会离开我们的样子！可是多么哀痛呵！党中央正式讣告：中国人民的伟大战士和政治家任弼时同志的确与我们告别了！
    在三十年来，伟大的中国革命斗争中，我们可以从各方面去追忆弼时同志所留下的不可磨灭的功绩。这需要很大的不朽的一部传记来追述他。我在此只略略提到一个方面。作为部队的政治工作者，任弼时同志他也留下优良典范。这值得我们去追念去学习的！弼时同志担任过湘赣六军团的政治领导者，担任过二、六两军团会师组成的第二方面军的政治委员，担任过抗日的八路军的总政治部主任。弼时同志担任过三个职务，恰当着中国人民军队处境极其困难的年代。例如弼时同志一九三三年夏天到湘赣地区，那是一个独立的工作环境，四面受敌人包围，根据地已日渐缩小。弼时同志奉命领导六军团向西突围，在湘、黔、川、鄂交界会合贺龙同志统率的二军团，坚决地保护人民利益，继续与强大敌人作战，尔后又奉命长征，取道川、滇、康三省边界，北上与朱总司令统率的四方面军会合，又继续北上到陕北与毛主席和第一方面军会合。在整整三年中间，部队均在长期突围中度过；斗争的艰苦是空前的，对于中国人民军队是最严重的考验，尤其对于部队的领导人更是极其严重的考验。弼时同志与我党其他的长征领导者们，同样的胜利地受了这个考验。这是对中国人民最伟大的贡献。因为在长征中受敌人四面包围，受敌人前截后堵，部队的政治领导与军事行动稍有偏差，即可造成不可补偿的损失，甚至使部队陷于覆没。假如在长征中不能胜利突围，不能保持中国人民军队，则尔后的中国革命局面的开展，将是另外一种形势，足见领导长征度过困难的重要性了。弼时同志在这方面遗留的典型，便是他在工作中的原则性和自我牺牲精神。这是中国人民永远要纪念他的！
    在目前新中国建设期中，遇着美帝国主义发动侵略。为了制止侵略、保卫和平，我人民解放军全体同志应站在自己的岗位上，担任巩固国防的神圣任务。弼时同志恰恰是一个好的榜样，我们应向他学习，拿完成光荣的国防任务来纪念他！
