　　In Memory of Uncle Ren
　　Liu Maomao

　　My dearest Uncle Ren! When I heard the news of your passing, I felt boundless grief!

　　I recall: In 1945, when I first arrived in Yan'an, my father took me into your resting room. At that time, I saw a man with thick black eyebrows and a small black mustache under his nose, lying on a soft couch reading a newspaper. My father told me, "This is Uncle Ren."

　　The first time I met you, I was very afraid of you, especially of that small black mustache under your nose; when you took my hand and told me to sit on your lap, I deeply felt that you were approachable and kind, a benevolent and amiable person! I remember that you called me "Little Mao Kid" and "Son of the Revolution."

　　In 1947, when the Chiang bandits attacked Yan'an, you left Yan'an, and Yuanzhi and I followed the school in the retreat. In a small town, you sent someone to find us. I lived with you for more than two months.

　　Yuan Dong and I went to your place, and you told me, "Your father has gone to Jin-Cha-Ji." When I cried and asked you for my father, you said, "Be my son, and call me father from now on." The next day, when I still called you Uncle Ren, you said, "Wrong, wrong, you should call me father," which made everyone around us laugh.

　　At that time, I was very naughty and refused to sleep at night. You always coaxed me to bed like a child; sometimes you said, "Go to bed early, get up early tomorrow, and we'll go hunt pheasants together."

　　Every day after dinner, you would hold my hand with one hand and Yuanzhi's hand with the other to take a walk in the countryside. At that time, we lived in a small village on a hillside, and there was a small river at the foot of the mountain. You often sat on the bank of this river and told us stories. When you talked about your arrest in Wuhan, terror seized me; when you talked about how my mother was sentenced to death by Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, I cried. At that time, you stroked my hair and said, "Don't cry, you must understand hatred, you must turn grief into strength!" Yes, I understood hatred, Uncle Ren taught me hatred!

　　Due to the war environment, you sent me, Yuanzhi, and Yuanzheng to Jin-Sui, and later I went to Jin-Cha-Ji.

　　After arriving in Beijing, I met you again. At this time, your health was very poor, your blood pressure was as high as 200, but you still cared about me and still called me "Mao Kid."

　　One Saturday afternoon, I went to see you, and you asked me, "Have you joined the Youth League?" "I have," I replied. You then asked me, "Do you know what a Youth League member should do? Tell me."

　　"Unite the broad masses of young people and play an exemplary role in various tasks; the Youth League is the Party's assistant and should assist the Party's work..." I was very satisfied with my answer.

　　"Haha," you smiled, "You haven't memorized the formula very well. Are you a student? Students should study hard, have you forgotten?" At this time, I was embarrassed and felt my face burning.

　　After returning, I read the "Work and Tasks of the Youth League" carefully!

　　Now, you and I are eternally separated, but your spirit will forever live in my heart! I will always remember your words: "Turn grief into strength," I will always remember you saying "Son of the Revolution." The son of the revolution must inherit his father's great revolutionary cause! Rest in peace, dear Uncle Ren!
　　Your Mao Kid, Liu Maomao in Beijing

　　Editor's note: Comrade Liu Maomao's name is Yunruo, and he is the son of Comrade Liu Shaoqi. When the Chiang bandits attacked Yan'an, he lived with Comrade Bishi for more than two months.

　　悼任伯伯
    刘毛毛
    我最亲爱的任伯伯！当我听到你逝世的消息时，我感到无限的悲痛！
    回忆起：一九四五年，我刚到延安时，爸爸把我领进你的休息室。当时我看到一个眉毛浓黑，鼻子底下有一撮小黑胡的人，躺在软榻上看报纸。爸爸告诉我说：“这是任伯伯。”
    第一次和你见面时，我很怕你，尤其怕你鼻子底下的小撮黑胡子；当你拉着我的手，叫我坐在你的腿上时，我深感到你可亲可近，是一个慈祥和蔼的人！我记得，那时你叫我“小毛娃子”与“革命的儿子”。
    一九四七年，蒋匪进攻延安时，你离开了延安，我和远志跟着学校撤退。在一个不大的镇子里，你派人找到了我们。我和你在一起生活了两个多月。
    我和远东到你处，你告诉我说：“你爸爸已到晋察冀了。”当我哭着向你要爸爸时，你说：“做我的儿子吧，以后就叫我爸爸好了。”第二天我仍叫你任伯伯时，你说：“叫错了，叫错了，应该叫爸爸。”把周围的人都惹得哄哄大笑。
    那时我很顽皮，晚上不肯睡觉，你总是像哄小孩一样，把我送到床上去睡觉；有时你说：“早点睡，明天早点起，我们一起打野鸡去。”
    每天吃过晚饭，你一只手拉着我，一只手拉着远志到野外去散步。当时我们住在半山上的一个小村子里，山底下有一条小河，你经常坐在这河岸上给我们讲故事。当你讲到你在武汉被捕时，恐怖攫住了我；当你讲到我的母亲怎样在南京被蒋介石判处死刑时，我哭了。那时你摸着我的头发说：“不要哭，要懂得憎恨，要化悲痛为力量！”是的，我懂得了憎恨，任伯伯教会了我憎恨！
    由于战争的环境，你把我、远志和远征送到晋绥，后来我到了晋察冀。
    到北京以后，我又和你见面了。这时，你的身体很不好，血压高至二百左右，但你仍很关心我，仍叫我“毛娃子”。
    一个星期六的下午，我去看你，你问我。“加入青年团了吗？”“加入了”我回答说。你又问我：“你知道一个青年团员应该做些什么？说说看。”
    “团结广大青年群众，在各种工作中起模范作用；青年团是党的助手，要协助党的工作……”我对于自己的回答表示很满意。
    “哈哈，”你笑了笑，“八股背得还不熟。你是学生吗？学生应该把功课学好，忘记了吗？”这时，我窘住了，觉得脸是火辣辣的。
    回来后，我把“青年团的工作与任务”好好的读了几遍！
    现在，你和我永别了，可是你的精神永远活在我的心上！我永远记住你的话：“化悲痛为力量”，我永远记住你说的“革命的儿子”。革命的儿子要继承父亲的伟大的革命事业！请安息吧，亲爱的任伯伯！
                                      你的毛娃子刘毛毛于北京
    编者按：刘毛毛同志名允若，是刘少奇同志的儿子。他在蒋匪进攻延安时，曾与弼时同志在一起生活过两个多月。
