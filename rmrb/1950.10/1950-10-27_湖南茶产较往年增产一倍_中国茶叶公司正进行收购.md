Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 25th. This year, the total tea production in Hunan Province reached 387,400 dan (a unit of weight), exceeding the original tea production plan by 40 percent, and increasing by 99 percent compared to last year. The Anhua branch of the China Tea Company and the Changsha Purchasing Office have already purchased 87,560 dan of crude black tea, which, after refining, became 58,000 dan of export black tea, exceeding the original plan of 41,000 dan for export black tea.

Hunan Province is one of China's main tea-producing areas. Among the province's 77 counties, 64 produce tea. At its peak, annual tea production reached 700,000 to 800,000 dan. However, due to the long-term destruction by the Kuomintang reactionary government, tea production drastically declined. Before liberation, about 80 percent of the tea hills in the province were damaged, and tea production was only over 190,000 dan.

After the liberation of Hunan, the Hunan Provincial People's Government adopted various effective measures to vigorously support tea farmers in restoring tea production. The People's Government issued tea loans totaling 37,286 shi (a unit of dry volume) of rice to help tea farmers rebuild tea gardens and cultivate tea trees. During the tea season, technical cadres were dispatched to guide tea farmers in picking and planting tea. In addition, the Anhua branch of the China Tea Company and the Changsha Purchasing Office were established, with 49 purchasing stations set up in various tea-producing areas to help tea farmers solve the problem of tea sales and protect their interests. This spring and summer, the above-mentioned purchasing stations purchased a total of 87,560 dan of crude black tea and 94,500 dan of crude green tea.

In order to further restore and develop tea production, the Hunan Provincial People's Government has formulated the tea production policy for 1951, stipulating that next year, on the basis of consolidating the existing output, efforts must be made to improve the quality of tea.

　　湖南茶产较往年增产一倍  中国茶叶公司正进行收购
    【新华社长沙二十五日电】湖南全省今年共产茶叶三十八万七千四百余市担，超过原订茶叶生产计划的百分之四十，较去年增产百分之九十九。中国茶叶公司安化分公司和长沙收购处，已收购红毛茶八万七千五百六十担，经精制成外销的红茶共五万八千市担，超过原订外销红茶四万一千担的计划。
    湖南省是我国主要产茶区之一，全省七十七县中产茶者达六十四县，茶产最盛时曾年产七、八十万担，后经国民党反动政府长期摧残，茶产量即剧烈下降，至解放前，全省约有百分之八十的茶山遭受破坏，茶叶产量仅为十九万余市担。
    湖南解放后，湖南省人民政府即采取各种有效措施，大力扶持茶农恢复茶叶生产。人民政府共发放了三万七千二百八十六石大米的茶叶贷款，帮助茶农重整茶园，培植茶树；并在茶季派出技术干部，指导茶农采茶种茶。另外又成立中国茶叶公司安化分公司和长沙收购处，在各产茶区分设了四十九个收购站，帮助茶农解决了茶叶的销路问题，保障茶农利益。今年春、夏两季，上述各收购站共收购了红毛茶八万七千五百六十担，黑毛茶九万四千五百担。
    为了进一步恢复并发展茶叶生产，湖南省人民政府已拟定一九五一年的茶叶生产方针，规定明年须在巩固现有产量的基础上，大力提高茶叶品质。
