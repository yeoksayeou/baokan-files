Shaoxing People Commemorate Lu Xun
Establish Lu Xun Cultural Center, Cinema, etc.

[By Our Own Correspondent] Lu Xun's hometown, Shaoxing, Zhejiang, after its liberation in May last year, local people, under the leadership and support of the People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, established cultural centers, cinemas, and Yue Opera troupes named after Lu Xun to commemorate him.

The Lu Xun Cultural Center was initiated by people from all walks of life in Shaoxing at the thirteenth anniversary of Lu Xun's death last year. Its purpose is to collect and display Lu Xun's cultural relics from his lifetime and help everyone learn from Lu Xun. Initially, the center was located in Sanwei Study, Lu Xun's childhood school residence. In December of last year, it was moved to Lu Xun's former residence, "Zhou Family's Old House." The cultural relics displayed in the center include 46 volumes of "Yu Si" edited by Lu Xun during the "May Fourth" period, two volumes of physiology and hygiene lecture notes hand-compiled by Lu Xun when he taught in Shaoxing, the complete works of Lu Xun, and many of Lu Xun's photographs (including a group photo of Lu Xun, George Bernard Shaw, and Cai Yuanpei at Soong Ching-ling's residence in 1933, etc.). In addition, there are Lu Xun's favorite small dark blue flower pot and his childhood school desk. The center also has a library, reading room, entertainment room, and auditorium. The library has more than 10,000 volumes of new and old books, and the reading room has newspapers, magazines, and other illustrated periodicals. The entertainment room is equipped with ball games and chess. Many people from all walks of life come to read and borrow books every day. In the past year, the center has cooperated with the Shaoxing branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to hold a Soviet painting exhibition, assisted in the establishment of the Local Opera Workers Association, ran training courses for old artists, and engaged in adapting old dramas. Since July of this year, the center's expenses have been directly allocated by the Cultural and Educational Department of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government.

The Lu Xun Cinema opened in late December last year. As of October 3 this year, it has screened 77 films, providing the people of Shaoxing with noble spiritual food.

Yue Opera is a local opera in Shaoxing and has become popular in the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou triangle area in recent years. After liberation, the people's political consciousness has gradually increased, and they have begun to dislike the content of old dramas full of feudal consciousness. Since its establishment in December last year, the Lu Xun Yue Opera Troupe has successively performed new Yue Opera anti-hegemony stories adapted from operas and Peking operas, such as "Nine Pieces of Clothing," the production story "Wang Xiuluan," and the peasant revolutionary stories "Chuang Wang Enters Beijing" and "Hong Niangzi" in Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, and other county towns and villages, which are very popular among the masses. Recently, in order to cooperate with the land reform movement, the troupe is going deep into the countryside to perform. (Correspondent Zhang Lihao)

　　绍兴人民纪念鲁迅
    创办鲁迅文化馆电影院等
    【本报讯】鲁迅的故乡——浙江绍兴，于去年五月解放后，当地人民在人民政府和中国共产党的领导与支持下，创办了以鲁迅为名的文化馆、电影院和越剧团等文艺组织，以纪念鲁迅。
    鲁迅文化馆是在去年鲁迅逝世十三周年纪念会上由绍兴各界人士发起创建的，以征集和陈列鲁迅生前文物、帮助大家学习鲁迅为目的。开始时，馆址设在鲁迅幼年的学寓——三味书屋。去年十二月迁至鲁迅故居“周家老屋”。馆内陈列的文物有鲁迅在“五四”时代主编的《语丝》四十六册、鲁迅在绍兴执教时期手编的生理卫生讲义两本、鲁迅全集和鲁迅的相片多帧（其中有一九三三年鲁迅在宋庆龄寓所与萧伯纳、蔡元培的合影等）。此外，还有鲁迅生前喜爱的深蓝色小花盆和幼年念书的书桌等。馆内另辟有图书室、阅览室、文娱室、礼堂等。图书室共有新旧书籍万余册，阅览室有报纸、杂志及其他画刊等，文娱室设有球类和棋类。每天各界人民前来阅读、借书的很多。一年来该馆曾配合中苏友好协会绍兴分会举行苏联画片展览，并协助成立地方戏曲工作者协会、开办旧艺人讲习班、从事改编旧剧等工作。自本年七月份起，该馆经费已由浙江省人民政府文教厅直接拨发。
    鲁迅电影院自去年十二月下旬开幕，到今年十月三日，已放映了电影片七十七部，供给了绍兴人民以高尚的精神食粮。
    越剧是绍兴地方戏，近年来已盛行于沪宁杭三角地带。解放后，人民政治觉悟逐渐提高，已开始厌恶充满封建意识的旧剧内容。鲁迅越剧团从去年十二月成立后，在绍兴、萧山等县城乡先后演出由歌剧、京剧等改编的新越剧反霸故事《九件衣》、生产故事《王秀鸾》、农民革命故事《闯王进京》、《红娘子》等，深得群众欢迎。最近该团为配合土地改革运动，正深入农村演出。（通讯员张立皓）
