Xinhua News Agency, 21st: State-owned trading companies have generally adjusted national grain prices to appropriately narrow the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products and to make the price ratio between coarse and fine grains more reasonable.

Due to the faster recovery of agricultural production than industrial production in our country over the past year, coupled with this year's widespread bumper harvest of grain, national grain prices have fallen significantly since the new grain entered the market more than two months ago. The market prices of rice and coarse grains are generally lower than the listed prices, widening the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products. In order to develop urban-rural exchange and ensure industrial and agricultural production, the Trade Department of the Central People's Government has instructed various localities to universally and substantially purchase new grain over the past month, thereby reversing the downward trend of grain prices. Recently, on the basis of maintaining the existing listed price levels of industrial products, it issued a circular to state-owned trading companies in various localities on October 10 to adjust grain prices. From October 12, grain prices in major and medium-sized cities across the country were adjusted one after another. Taking the end of September as the base, the average price of coarse grains (red sorghum, corn) nationwide was increased by 7%, and the price of rice in East China and Central South China and other regions was increased by 10%. As a result of the state-owned grain companies continuing to purchase large quantities based on this price standard, the excessive trend of the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products has been reversed, and the grain prices and market prices, which have been frequently disconnected for several months, have also begun to converge. For example, before the adjustment, on September 30, the listed price of rice in Shanghai was 1,346 yuan per jin, while the market price was only 1,179 yuan, 12.46% lower than the listed price. After the adjustment, on October 14, the listed price of rice was 1,380 yuan per jin, and the market price rose to 1,400 yuan, slightly higher than the listed price by 20 yuan. Another example is that on September 30, the listed price of corn in Tianjin was 630 yuan per jin, while the market price was only 560 yuan, 11.11% lower than the listed price. After the adjustment, on October 12, both the listed price and the market price were 760 yuan. On the other hand, the prices of cotton cloth in various regions basically remained unchanged from September 30 to October 14.

The prices of wheat and flour in various regions have been adjusted upwards by an average of about 16% in this adjustment compared to the end of September. Because the prices of wheat and flour have been low for a long time, the listed price has always been far lower than the market price since this summer. Now, the adjustment rate of wheat, flour, and millet prices is larger than that of other grains, which will promote an appropriate expansion of the price difference between coarse and fine grains, making the exchange rate more reasonable, and ensuring the smooth supply of wheat, flour, and millet. It also appropriately narrows the scissors difference between fine grains and industrial products.

In addition, along with the adjustment of grain prices, cotton prices in various regions have also been adjusted. For example, in September, the average listed price of ginned cotton in six major cities including Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, Beijing, Taiyuan, and Xi'an was 7,508.33 yuan per shi jin. After the adjustment, the listed price was 7,766.67 yuan, an increase of 3.44%.

　　国营贸易公司调整全国粮价
    缩小工农业品剪刀差额
    粗细粮间、细粮与工业品间的差价皆趋于合理
    【新华社二十一日讯】国营贸易公司业已普遍地调整全国粮食牌价，以便适当地缩小工农业品的剪刀差价，并使粗、细粮比价趋于合理。
    由于一年来我国农业生产恢复的速度比工业生产为快，加以今年粮食普获丰收，新粮上市两个多月以来，全国粮价下落很多，大米及粗粮市价普遍低于牌价，工农业品的剪刀差价扩大。中央人民政府贸易部为发展城乡交流，保障工农业生产，一个月以来已指示各地普遍而大量地收购新粮，因此扭转了粮价的跌势，近来，在维持工业品现有牌价水准的基础上，于十月十日通令各地国营贸易公司调整粮价。十月十二日起，全国各大、中城市的粮食牌价即先后作了调整，以九月底为基准，全国粗粮（红粮、玉米）平均调高百分之七，在华东、中南等地大米调高百分之十。国营粮食公司根据这一牌价标准继续大量收购的结果，工农业品间的剪刀差价过大之势已被扭转，几个月来经常脱节的粮食牌价和市价也开始趋于一致。如在调整以前，九月三十日上海每斤大米牌价一千三百四十六元，而市价只为一千一百七十九元，比牌价低百分之十二点四六，调整以后，十月十四日每斤大米牌价一千三百八十元，市价则随升至一千四百元，比牌价稍高二十元。又如九月三十日天津每斤玉米牌价六百三十元，市价只为五百六十元，比牌价低百分之十一点一一，经调整后，十月十二日牌价和市价均为七百六十元。另一方面，九月三十日至十月十四日期间，各地纱布价格基本上都未有变动。
    各地小麦和面粉的价格在这次调整中较九月底平均调升百分之十六左右。由于麦、面价格偏低已久，今夏以来，牌价一向远低于市价；现在小麦、面粉和小米价格的调整率比其他粮种为大，这将促使粗、细粮差价适当扩大，换算趋于合理，并保证麦、面及小米的顺利供应，同时也适当地缩小了细粮与工业品间的剪刀差价。
    此外，与调整粮价同时，各地棉价亦已作了调整。如九月份上海、汉口、天津、北京、太原、西安等六大城市每市斤皮棉牌价平均为七千五百零八元点三三，调整后牌价为七千七百六十六元点六七，调升百分之三点四四。
