An Honest Word on National Day
    Liang Shuming

    Last year on this day, the grand ceremony of the founding of the nation was held, and I was still in Beibei, Sichuan; this year, however, I am in Beijing. I left Sichuan for Beijing this New Year's Day. From the day I arrived in Beijing until now, I have been observing, experiencing, and appreciating the atmosphere of the founding of the nation. Especially from early April to the recent mid-September, I visited Shandong, Pingyuan, Henan, and the northeastern provinces, personally witnessing many new atmospheres, which made me nod in agreement: this is indeed the beginning of a new China!

    Although I am still a young person in front of many older generations, I was also one of the small soldiers during the 1911 Revolution. No matter how insignificant, I contributed a share of my heart and strength to that revolution. Therefore, in the past, every time on Double Ten National Day, I felt it had meaning. But this time, in the Liberation War, I did not participate. From the autumn of 1946 to the winter of 1949, I stayed at home and did not go out. Moreover, when the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and many democratic parties called for the convocation of the New Political Consultative Conference, I even wrote to Chairman Mao and Mr. Zhou Enlai declaring that I would not come. (Note: The letter was entrusted to someone from Chongqing in January 1949, stating that I would only speak about national affairs but not take action, and please forgive me for not coming.) Precisely because of this, I was not in Beijing last year on this day. To be honest, if it were not for the subsequent understanding, this new National Day would not arouse any interest in my heart.

    Today, on National Day, I indeed feel excited in my heart because I realize that a new life of the Chinese nation is indeed beginning. What are the things that make me have this realization? Pleasing new atmospheres can be seen everywhere, and specific examples are too numerous to mention. Especially in the outer provinces more than in Beijing, and in agriculture, industry, and all trades more than in politics. The sights and feelings of five months of travel, I will write in a book "The Issue of China's Nation-Building" to ask for correction from the Chinese people, so I won't say much here. Here I will only say the most basic:

    The most basic thing is that I saw that many, many people were simply dead, but now they have come back to life. How can this be said? In the past, all I saw were dead people. — So-called "walking corpses," their bodies not dead, their hearts already dead. Most people were just trying to get by, muddling through one day at a time, and not caring about anything else. Originally, even if they wanted to care, they couldn't, because they were the ones being managed. And those who managed them, controlled national affairs, were oily and glib, saying things insincerely, saying all the nice things, doing all the bad things. — Their doing all the bad things is precisely because they say all the nice things. The most terrible thing is insincerity, shamelessness; their hearts are dead here. With the whole country under their leadership, how could it not be dragged to a dead end! Today it is different. Everywhere I go, I can see many people standing at their respective posts doing serious work, doing it with great enthusiasm, and even encouraging each other to do it, doing it in an organized and coordinated way. Everyone's minds and intelligence are used in serious places. Workers are improving their skills day by day, and creative inventions are emerging endlessly. Farmers, who have been scattered for thousands of years, can actually be organized very well. Is this not coming back to life? From death to life, from death to rebirth, one cannot but give credit to the leadership of the Communist Party. Everyone knows that the Communist Party has great hearts and great aspirations, is good at organizing, and has methods. But I have discovered that their difference is that they don't necessarily choose good things to say, but they can choose good things to do. That kind of deadly disease of "insincerity" is less common in them. They don't want to wear masks, but want to do real things. Therefore, they don't protect shortcomings, don't cover up, and correct mistakes. There is pain and itching, and likes and dislikes are real, which is the only source of vitality. Expanding from this point of vitality, there is the fresh vitality in today's vast situation, and it will open up endless prospects in the future.

    People who have true confidence don't need to exaggerate and write some "good articles." I think this basic honest word is enough to celebrate today's National Day.

### 国庆日的一篇老实话

　　国庆日的一篇老实话
    梁漱溟
    去年今日开国盛典，我还在四川北碚；今年我却在北京了。我是今年元旦离川来京的。自到京那一天，直到现在，我都在观察、体会、领略这开国气象。尤其是从四月初间到最近九月半，我参观访问了山东、平原、河南各省和东北各省地方，亲眼看见许多新气象，使我不由暗自点头承认：这确是一新中国的开始！
    我虽在许多老前辈面前，还是一个年轻人，然而当一九一一年革命时，却亦是其中小卒之一了。不管如何渺小，那次革命我曾尽一分心力。所以过去每当双十国庆，我是感觉有意味的。而这次解放战争呢，我却没有参加。从一九四六年秋到四九年冬，我一直闭户不出。而且当中共中央和许多民主党派号召开新政协，我还写信给毛主席和周恩来先生声明我不来。（注：信是四九年一月从重庆托人带出，声明我对于国事将只发言而不行动，请恕我不能来。）就为此，所以去年今日我没在京。说老实话，对于今天这新的国庆日，假如不是事后有所体认，那在我心中将不起什么兴味。
    今天的国庆日，我的确心中感到起劲，因为我体认到中国民族一新生命确在开始了。究竟在那些事情上使我有此体认？可喜的新气象到处可见，具体事例数说不完。特别是在外省较比在北京多，在农工百业上较比在政治上多。五个月游历的见闻和感想，我将写“中国建国问题”一书以就正于国人，这里不多说。这里我只说那最基本的：
    最基本的就是我看见许许多多人简直是死了，现在又竟活起来。这话怎么说呢？过去我满眼看见的都是些死人。——所谓“行尸走肉”，其身未死，其心已死。大多数是混饭吃，混一天算一天，其他好歹不管。本来要管亦管不了，他们原是被人管的。而那些管人的呢，把持国事，油腔滑调，言不由衷，好话说尽，坏事作尽。——其坏事作尽，正为其好话说尽。可怕的莫过言不由衷，恬不知耻；其心死绝就在这里。全国在他们领导下，怎不被拖向死途！今天不然了。我走到各处都可以看见不少人站在各自岗位上正经干，很起劲的干，乃至彼此互相鼓励着干，有组织配合地干。大家心思聪明都用在正经地方。在工人就技艺日进，创造发明层出不穷。在农民则散漫了数千年，居然亦能组织的很好。这不是活起来，是什么？由死到活，起死回生，不能不归功共产党的领导。共产党大心大愿，会组织，有办法，这是人都晓得的。但我发见他们的不同处，是话不一定拣好的说，事情却能拣好的作。“言不由衷”的那种死症，在他们较比少。他们不要假面子，而想干真事儿。所以不护短，不掩饰，错了就改。有痛有痒，好恶真切，这便是唯一生机所在。从这一点生机扩大起来，就有今天广大局面中的新鲜活气，并将以开出今后无尽的前途。
    真有信心的人，用不着夸大其词作什么“好文章”。只这篇起码的老实话，我以为在庆祝今天国庆上足够了。
