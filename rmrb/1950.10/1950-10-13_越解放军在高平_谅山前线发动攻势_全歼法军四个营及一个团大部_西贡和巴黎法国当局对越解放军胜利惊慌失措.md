    Saigon and Paris French Authorities Panic Over Viet Liberation Army Victory
    [Xinhua News Agency, 12th] The Vietnam News Agency reported on the 11th: A spokesperson for the Vietnam People's Liberation Army Headquarters announced on the 10th: The Vietnam People's Liberation Army recently launched an offensive on the Cao Bang-Lang Son front, completely annihilating four French battalions and a large part of a regiment. The battle lasted nine days and nights, ending on the 9th. Detailed battle results are still being tallied, but it is estimated that approximately 2,000 French soldiers were captured, including French commander Colonel La Baisse, Deputy Commander of the Northern Border Military Region Lieutenant Colonel Charles, Cao Bang Province puppet governor Hai Du Chu (transliteration), as well as a large number of French officers and the entire command personnel of La Baisse and Charles' forces. The annihilated French forces, with the exception of one battalion of mercenaries, were composed of elite French combat battalions. The fighting took place on a 30-kilometer front near Cao Bang and That Khe (southeast of Cao Bang). The annihilated troops of Charles were the French forces retreating from Cao Bang, and the troops of La Baisse were reinforcements dispatched from Lang Son.
    The spokesperson stated that in this battle, the local People's Army and the militia in the Cao Bang and Lang Son areas provided significant assistance to the regular army. The local people also provided great support to the frontline combat troops.
    On October 3rd, after the French army retreated from Cao Bang, the Vietnam People's Liberation Army entered the city, and the people's political power has now been restored there.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 12th] The recent victory of the Vietnam People's Liberation Army on the Cao Bang-Lang Son front has caused great panic among the French authorities. According to reports from Agence France-Presse and the Associated Press: A French military spokesperson in Saigon, commenting on this French defeat, had to admit: "This loss makes the already weak French forces even weaker. In this critical period, the French army really cannot withstand this loss." In Paris, the French cabinet hastily convened a meeting on the 10th to discuss the situation in Vietnam. After the cabinet meeting, a statement was issued, exclaiming that "the situation there is serious," and decided to send the Minister of Relations with the Federal Members, Letourneau, and cabinet member Hu Yun to Vietnam to "discuss countermeasures." On the 10th and 11th, Indochina stocks on the Paris stock market also fell across the board.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 12th] Most Western European newspapers reported the victory of the Vietnam Democratic Republic People's Liberation Army and the shock in Paris on the 10th and 11th as headline news. The headline of L'Humanité on the 11th was "The Expeditionary Force Suffers a Miserable Defeat in Northern Tokyo." L'Humanité also published an editorial calling on the French people to stop the despicable war of the French and American imperialists. The London Daily Worker, in an editorial commenting on the situation in Vietnam on the 11th, said: "The French and American imperialists are attempting to label the people of Indochina, who are fighting to break free from French rule, as aggressors and believe that they should be suppressed." The editorial pointed out that Acheson's plan to "remodel" the United Nations is to pool the resources of imperialist countries and apply them to "those places in the world where the struggle for liberation movements poses the greatest threat to the imperialists' robber plans." The newspaper continued: "The purpose of this plan is to control the whole of Asia for the benefit of the tin, rubber, oil, and plantation industries of Europe and America, and to exercise arbitrary rule over Asia through various puppet government organizations." The newspaper also said: "Once the call to intervene in Indochina is sounded, our children will have to die for it."

    【新华社十二日讯】越南通讯社十一日讯：越南人民解放军总部发言人于十日宣布：越南人民解放军最近在高平——谅山前线发动攻势，全歼法军四个营及一个团的大部。战斗经过九昼夜，已于九日结束。详细战果尚在清查中，估计俘获法军约两千人，其中包括法军司令赖巴西上校，北部边界军区副司令夏尔同中校，高平省伪省长海度除（译音），以及大批法军军官和赖巴西和夏尔同两部分军队的司令部全部人员。被歼法军除一营雇佣兵外，都是由法军精锐的战斗营所组成。战斗在高平和七溪（高平东南）附近长达三十公里的战线上进行。被歼的夏尔同所部是由高平撤退的法军，赖巴西所部是由谅山出动的增援部队。
    发言人称，在这一战斗中，地方人民军与高平、谅山地区的民兵，曾予正规军以很大的帮助。当地人民也给前线作战部队以很大支持。
    十月三日，法军自高平撤退后，越南人民解放军即进入该城，现该地人民政权已告恢复。
    【新华社十二日讯】越南人民解放军最近在高平——谅山前线的胜利，使法国当局大为恐慌。据法新社与美联社消息：西贡法国军方发言人在评论法军这一次失败时，不得不承认：“此次损失，使兵力薄弱的法军，更形软弱。在此危急时期，法军实在经不起这一损失”。在巴黎，法国内阁于十日急忙召开会议，讨论越南战局问题。法内阁会后发表声明，惊呼“该地形势严重”，并决定派联邦成员关系部部长勒都尔诺和内阁阁员许温前往越南“商讨对策”。十、十一两日，巴黎证券市场中的印度支那股票，亦全面下跌。
    【新华社布拉格十二日电】多数西欧报纸均于十日与十一日以头条新闻刊载越南民主共和国人民解放军的胜利以及巴黎震惊的情形。人道报十一日的头条新闻标题是《远征军在东京北部惨败。》人道报并发表社论，要求法国人民制止法、美帝国主义者的卑劣的战争。伦敦工人日报十一日在社论中评述越南局势时说：“法国及美国帝国主义者企图把挣脱法国统治而斗争的印度支那人民称为侵略者，并认为应该加以镇压。”社论指出：艾奇逊的“改造”联合国的计划就是要将帝国主义国家的资源凑集起来，应用在“世界上那些解放运动的斗争对帝国主义者的强盗计划最具威胁性的地方”。该报继称：“这计划的目的就是为欧美的锡矿、橡皮、石油及种植业的利益，控制整个的亚洲，并经由各傀儡政府机构来对亚洲进行专横的统治。”该报又说：“干涉印度支那的号角一响，我们的孩子们就要为它去送死了。”
