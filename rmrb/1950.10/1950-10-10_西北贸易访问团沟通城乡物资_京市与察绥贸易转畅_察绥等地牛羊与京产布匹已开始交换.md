　　Northwest Trade Delegation Facilitates Communication of Urban and Rural Goods
    Trade Between Beijing and Chahar-Suiyuan Becomes Smoother
    Cattle and Sheep from Chahar-Suiyuan and Other Places Have Begun to Be Exchanged for Beijing-Produced Cloth
    [Our Newspaper] The trade relationship between Beijing and the northwestern regions of Chahar and Suiyuan has been initially developed through the efforts of the Beijing "Northwest Trade Delegation." Cattle and sheep from Chahar, Suiyuan, and other places are being transported to Beijing in a steady stream, and some industrial products manufactured in Beijing are also being shipped to Chahar and Suiyuan.
    Due to the prolonged war, trade relations between Beijing and Chahar-Suiyuan suffered significant damage. Although there was some exchange of goods between the two regions after liberation, the weak capital of private businesses, resulting from over a decade of price fluctuations and exploitation by the enemy and puppet regimes, and their habit of sitting in cities and selling only fast-moving goods, led to a slow recovery of normal exchange. Some urban industrial products struggled to find markets, while certain agricultural and sideline products were stockpiled in rural areas.
    In order to promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce organized a "Northwest Trade Delegation" comprising both public and private commercial participants. The delegation traveled to Chahar, Suiyuan, and other places to conduct investigations and liaise with trade organizations and private industrial and commercial operators in those regions, leading to a new development in trade between Beijing and Chahar-Suiyuan.
    According to the delegation's investigation, livestock, furs, mountain products, medicinal materials, mushrooms, eggs, casings, and other products abundant in these regions are in great need of export. At the same time, they urgently need imports of cloth, brick tea, sugar, cigarettes, matches, silk, shoes, hats, and daily necessities. Beijing products have a certain market share in Chahar and Suiyuan, and the local people have always admired Beijing goods, especially Beijing-produced August 1st white cloth, plain socks, towels, and other simple and durable items, which are most popular. Criticisms of Beijing products were also heard: quality cannot be consistently maintained; supply is not regular; there are too many brands; and less-than-truckload transportation leads to higher costs. The delegation's connections have greatly aroused the attention of trade organizations and private industrial and commercial operators in Chahar, Suiyuan, and other places to the work of urban-rural material exchange, and they have unanimously expressed their willingness to establish trade relations with Beijing. Based on mutual needs and mutual benefit, units such as the Beijing Trust Company have successively conducted preliminary trade exchange negotiations with Zhangjiakou, Guisui, Baotou, and other places. An agreement in principle was reached with the Ximeng Trading Company on the types of goods to be exchanged, as well as the exchange locations and prices. An agreement was reached with the Suiyuan Trading Company to first conduct a trial transaction of exchanging 2,000 sheep for Beijing cotton cloth, towels, and other items. The "Hui People's Production and Supply Cooperative" in Guisui (an organization with more than 5,000 camels specializing in transportation to Xinjiang) also agreed to establish direct trade relations with Beijing to exchange goods back and forth. In addition, some Mongolian merchants in Baotou (merchants specializing in Mongolian trade) also expressed their willingness to organize joint operations and exchange goods with Beijing. Furthermore, the participation of Beijing private merchant representatives in the trade delegation enabled them to understand this new business arena and clarified that the operation and distribution of commercial business must face the vast rural areas to have a future.
    In mid-August, the joint public-private livestock joint venture group, which was established as a result of the development of trade between Beijing and Chahar-Suiyuan, began procurement. In addition to the first batch of 150 tons of cattle and sheep already transported (87 cattle, 285 sheep), another 200 cattle and 2,000 sheep are being shipped in succession; Beijing-produced industrial products such as August 1st white cloth have also begun to be shipped.
    The establishment of trade relations between Beijing and Chahar-Suiyuan, especially the emergence of the joint public-private livestock joint venture group, has promoted the joint formation of purchasing organizations in industries such as mountain products, tobacco leaves, Chinese medicine, hemp shops, and dried and fresh fruits, who are willing to carry out material exchange business with the help of the government.

　　西北贸易访问团沟通城乡物资
    京市与察绥贸易转畅
    察绥等地牛羊与京产布匹已开始交换
    【本报讯】北京与西北察哈尔、绥远等地的贸易关系，已由京市“西北贸易访问团”的沟通得到初步的开展，察、绥等地的牛羊正源源运京，北京市生产的工业品亦有部分输往察绥。
    由于长期战争，北京与察、绥间的贸易关系曾受到很大的破坏。解放后两地虽有物资交换，但因十余年来物价波动和敌伪压榨的结果，造成私营商业资力薄弱，在经营上又习惯于坐在城市里买卖一些顺销货物，以致形成正常交换迟迟未能恢复，城市工业品有些找不到销售市场，若干农副产品又积压在农村。
    京市商业局为了促进城乡物资交流，曾组织包括有公私商业参加的“西北贸易访问团”，通过该团前往察、绥等地，调查了解和与各该地区贸易机构及私营工商业者的连系，使北京与察、绥间的贸易已有了新的开展。
    据访问团的调查，这些地区盛产的牲畜、皮毛、山货、药材、口蘑、鸡蛋、肠衣等产品，都是极需输出的，同时他们又迫切需要布匹、砖茶、糖、纸烟、火柴、绸缎、鞋帽和日用百货等的输入。北京的产品在察、绥市场上占有一定的销路，当地人民一向对京货很景仰，特别是北京产的八一白布、平口袜子，毛巾等朴实耐久，最受欢迎。同时也听到对北京产品的批评：质量不能经常保持；供应不经常；牌子太杂；和零担运输造成成本较高等。借访问团的连系大大的引起了察、绥等地贸易机构和私营工商业者对城乡物资交流工作的重视，一致表示愿意和北京建立贸易关系。基于双方需要、互助两利的情况下，北京信托公司等单位相继与张家口、归绥、包头等地进行初步的物资交换商谈，和西蒙贸易公司原则上确定了交换货物的种类，及交换地点、价格等。与绥远贸易公司商妥先试办以二千只羊交换北京棉布、毛巾等物的交易。归绥的“回民生产供应社”（有五千多只骆驼专往新疆进行运销的机构）也同意与北京直接建立交换来回物资的贸易关系。另外包头的部分旅蒙商（专营蒙古买卖的商人）也表示愿组织联营和北京进行物品交换。此外由于贸易访问团中有北京私商代表亲自参加这一工作，使他们了解了这块新的经营天地，明确了经营商业运销必须面向广大的农村才有前途。
    在八月中旬随着北京与察绥间贸易开展而产生的公私合营畜产联营小组已开始采购，除首批已经运来牛羊一百五十吨（八七只牛，二八五只羊）外，还有二百只牛和两千只羊正陆续启运中；北京产的工业品八一白布等亦开始输往。
    由于北京与察绥间贸易关系的建立，特别是公私合营畜产联营小组的产生，推动了此间山货、烟叶、国药、麻店、干鲜果等行业纷纷筹组联合采购机构，愿意在政府帮助下，进行物资交流业务。
