Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 17th: The case of the robbery at the Nanjing residence of the former Egyptian Embassy Chargé d'Affaires, Abati, in which Abati himself was stabbed by thugs, has been completely solved after a thorough investigation by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The case was a sabotage operation organized by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit spies. All fourteen perpetrators have been apprehended, and the spy organization's seals, letters of appointment, and other items have been seized. The case is now being handed over to the Municipal People's Court for severe trial.

The main culprit, Gao Xiachang, served as a police officer during the Japanese puppet regime. After the Japanese surrender, he served as the leader of the field team of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit criminal police. When Nanjing was liberated, he fled to Shanghai with the bandits. After Shanghai's liberation, he sneaked back to Nanjing. In February of this year, this criminal, along with Li Shanxiu and others, members of the bandit People's Socialist Party, formed the "China People's Anti-Communist, Anti-Russian National Salvation Association" spy organization to carry out sabotage activities. Gao was responsible for external liaison, and Li was in charge of internal affairs. Subsequently, they successively developed Gao Xiaju (Gao Xiachang's younger brother), Qi Rui, Tong Weimin, Zhang Yufeng, Li Jian, and others to participate in the organization, appointing Qi Rui as "Secretary," and Tong Weimin and Zhang Yufeng as "Liaison Group Leaders," and using Li's residence at 11 Ninghai Road as a secret meeting place. At the same time, the criminals distributed reactionary leaflets in the city, spreading rumors and confusing the public. In order to raise funds, Gao and Li carried a directive from the "China People's Anti-Communist, Anti-Russian National Salvation Association" in June to extort 200,000 yuan from Li Hongnian, the accounting director of the former U.S. Embassy; later, they attempted to extort money from the Xinxing Food Company, Xie Feng Cloth Shop, and other businesses, but failed. At this time, Zhang Mingshan, the former Egyptian Embassy cook, was fired for drunkenness and was resentful, seeking revenge. Zhang was originally acquainted with Gao Xiaju, who introduced him to his brother. Gao and his accomplices then plotted to rob Abati's residence, in order to achieve their counter-revolutionary conspiracy to undermine the prestige of our People's Government and to carry out their counter-revolutionary purpose of going to Hong Kong to contact Chiang Kai-shek's spy organization after obtaining the funds. Gao then asked his brother-in-law, Zhang Mingliang, to discuss the matter. Zhang enlisted the help of hooligans Gao Zhiying, Chen Xuerong, Chen Jinsheng, and others to plan, and Gao Zhiying and Chen Jinsheng went to Shanghai and Jurong County near Nanjing to invite habitual bandits Deng Dingyou (formerly referred to as Deng Qiyou) and Yu Liangkun (formerly referred to as Yu Liangde) and brought a gun. At this point, the conspiracy was complete. On the evening of September 3, Gao sent Zhang Mingliang, Deng Dingyou, Yu Liangkun, Chen Xuerong, Chen Jinsheng, and other five bandits to rob Abati's residence, and stabbed Abati.
