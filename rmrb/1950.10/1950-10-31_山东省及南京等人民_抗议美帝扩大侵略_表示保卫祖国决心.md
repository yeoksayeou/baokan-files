Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 29th. People from all walks of life in Nanjing and Shandong Province in East China have issued statements and telegrams, angrily protesting the repeated violations of our country's airspace by American aircraft, resolutely opposing the crazy behavior of American imperialism in expanding the war of aggression against Korea to our northeastern border, and unanimously supporting the solemn statement made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai to the United Nations again on October 26.

The Second First People's Representative Conference of Nanjing City, which is currently being held, issued a telegram stating: We unanimously support Foreign Minister Zhou's just telegram to the United Nations. We will never tolerate the aggression of American imperialism against us, nor can we sit idly by while American imperialism invades our friendly neighbor. The telegram resolutely stated: In order to defend the sacred motherland and world peace, we will not hesitate to pay any price, and we firmly believe that justice and peace will surely triumph.

People's organizations such as the Shandong Provincial and Qingdao Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, the Shandong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's Federation, the Youth Federation, the Student Federation, the Literary Federation, and the Jinan Sino-Soviet Friendship Association have all issued statements, unanimously stating that the people of Shandong will contribute all their strength to defend the territorial sovereignty of the motherland and world peace. The protest letter from the Third People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee of Qingdao City pointed out: We, the people of Qingdao, have fresh memories of the bloody history of the Japanese imperialist aggression against Korea and China, and the American imperialist exploitation of the people of Qingdao before liberation. We will intensify our unity and organization to fight to the end against the new aggression of American imperialism.
