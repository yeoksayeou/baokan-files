Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 28th: Bugala, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, returned to Prague on the 26th after leading a delegation from the World Federation of Democratic Youth to visit China. Bugala told a reporter from the Czechoslovak Youth League's newspaper "Youth Front": As representatives of the world's progressive youth, we received an indescribably warm welcome throughout China. Our visit to China came at a time when the US military had crossed the 38th parallel and the war was approaching the Chinese border. We personally witnessed the Chinese people's indignation and determination to fight against American aggression. We had hours of talks with commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and we also personally witnessed the grand celebrations of the first anniversary of the founding of the new Chinese Republic in various places. All of this made us realize how important free China is in the struggle to defend world peace.

Bugala then said: All the youth representatives from various countries who visited China this time will report to their compatriots about the vigorous development China has achieved in the past year after returning to their countries. China is a model for all people who are fighting for freedom. Bugala finally emphasized: The youth of the world will support the just demands made by the delegation of the World Federation of Democratic Youth to UN Secretary-General Lie on the eve of their departure from China, namely: inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the United Nations organization, and the US military withdrawing from Taiwan.

　　布加拉谈访华印象
    看到中国人民反对美帝侵略决心和在保卫和平斗争中的重要性
    【新华社布拉格二十八日电】世界民主青年联盟总书记布加拉，在率领世界民主青年联盟代表团访问中国后，已于二十六日返抵布拉格。布加拉告捷克斯洛伐克青年联盟机关报《青年阵线》报记者称：作为世界进步青年的代表，我们在全中国受到的热烈欢迎是难以形容的。我们访问中国，正是美国军队越过三八线，战争正在接近中国边境的时候。我们曾亲眼看到中国人民的愤慨情绪和为反对美国侵略而斗争的决心。我们曾和中国人民解放军指战员作过数小时的晤谈，也曾在各地亲眼看到新中国人民热烈庆祝自己的共和国成立一周年的盛况，这些都使我们认识了自由中国在保卫世界和平的斗争中是多么重要。
    布加拉接着说：所有这次访问中国的各国青年代表，将在回国之后，向他们的同胞报告中国一年来所获得的蓬勃发展，中国是一切正在为自由而斗争的人民的榜样。布加拉最后强调称：全世界的青年将支持世界民主青年联盟代表团在离华前夕向联合国秘书长赖伊所提出的正义要求，即：邀请中华人民共和国代表参加联合国组织，美国军队撤离台湾。
