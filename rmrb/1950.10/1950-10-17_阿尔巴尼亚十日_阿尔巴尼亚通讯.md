Ten Days in Albania
    —Albania Correspondence
    Xinhua News Agency Correspondent in Prague, Chen Shi Wu
    On May 28th, the People's Republic of Albania held the general election for the Second People's Assembly. The Albanian Journalists Association invited democratic journalists from many countries to visit. In addition to the Soviet journalists stationed in Tirana, the capital of Albania, journalists from newspapers in the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, as well as from the Italian newspaper *Unità* and the French newspaper *l'Humanité*, were invited. I also joined this tour group and visited this young people's republic for ten days.
  To Tirana
    We departed on the Hungarian-Soviet Airlines' bi-weekly Budapest-Tirana flight. The plane flew south over Yugoslavia and into Albania. Most of the country is mountainous. Western Albania, near the Adriatic Sea, gradually becomes flatter, with more arable land. The areas along the lakes and rivers are the more developed agricultural regions of Albania.
    Tirana appeared surrounded by mountains. The plane landed at 12:00 noon, and a car took everyone to the Dajti Hotel. This hotel is named after the nearby scenic Dajti Peak. It was once a villa for Italian capitalists, politicians, and fascist generals during the fascist rule, and now it has become a place for the People's Government to receive foreign guests.
  Albania's Past and Present
    Albania's history is a history of foreign rule. Although nominally independent after World War I, the feudal regime of the old King Zog was dependent on Italy, which led to the invasion of Mussolini's bandits. After Italy surrendered in 1943, Nazi German troops occupied the country. The Albanian people gradually awakened in centuries of deep suffering. After the founding of the Albanian Communist Party in 1941, the anti-fascist guerrilla war immediately flourished. The People's Guerrilla Force fought and contained nearly 200,000 occupying troops on this land of less than 29,000 square kilometers. Finally, the country was liberated under the victorious offensive of the Soviet army.
    Albania is now under the surveillance of the Tito clique of Yugoslavia, the Greek Royal Fascists, and Italian imperialism. However, under the leadership of the Albanian Workers' Party and its leader Hoxha, the Albanian people are bravely and resolutely carrying out the two-year plan for economic construction in a country with almost no industrial base, bringing the enjoyment of modern culture to a people where illiteracy used to be 83 percent. The days when the imperialists thought the Albanian people were backward and could be deceived are gone forever.
  The Albanian People's Election
    On the eve of the election, Tirana was newly decorated. Albania is divided into 121 electoral districts, each of which elects one representative to form the People's Assembly. Out of Albania's population of 1,181,000, there is approximately one representative for every 10,000 people.
    According to the constitution, all Albanian citizens who are 18 years of age or older, regardless of ethnicity, gender, or religion, have the right to vote, except for criminals and the mentally ill. The election is conducted by universal, direct, equal, and secret ballot. In order to accommodate illiterate people, the election uses black rubber bullets engraved with the double-headed eagle of the Albanian national emblem instead of ballots, much like the "bean selection" method used in the old liberated areas of China. There are two ballot boxes, one representing the Democratic Front candidate and the other a blank box. Every voter must reach into each ballot box once with their arm. When withdrawing their arm from the first box, their palm must remain tightly clenched, and then they must reach into the second box. Only the voter knows which box the bullet is placed in, thus implementing the spirit of secret ballot. We visited five or six electoral districts in the city and saw that the 80-year-old grandmothers and the young people who had just reached the voting age were all very proficient in using this voting method. They were all very familiar with the candidates in their districts.
    The participation of a large number of women in the election was one of the features of this election. In the 107th electoral district, 60 percent of the voters were women. As one of the marks of long-term Turkish rule, Albanian women, especially older women, still retain the habit of wearing veils. One of the slogans put forward by the Albanian Women's Federation in the election campaign was "Remove the veil and participate in the election." Many women removed their veils on the spot at mass meetings.
  The Transforming Albanian Economy
    Before liberation, Albania's economy was entirely a colonial economy. Foreign capital accounted for 75.6 percent of all industrial and mining investments, joint Albanian-foreign ventures accounted for 22.6 percent, and Albanian-owned ventures accounted for only 1.8 percent.
    In agriculture, feudal landlords and nobles ruled the vast countryside. Agricultural production remained in a very backward and primitive state. According to Iliaz Reka, Deputy Minister of Agriculture of Albania, before the war, landlords and rich peasants, who accounted for 3 percent of the agricultural population, occupied 40 percent of the country's arable land, while middle peasants, poor peasants, and hired peasants, who accounted for 97 percent, occupied only 60 percent of the land.
    After the People's Republic of Albania was proclaimed on January 11, 1946, the intense work of restoration began gradually. After three years of recovery, the face of Albania's economy has changed greatly. The two-year plan announced last July marked the beginning of an unprecedented economic construction in Albania's history and put forward the slogan of "laying the foundation for socialism."
    The two-year plan is a plan for the transformation of Albania's national economy and a plan for the country's industrialization. The total investment in the plan is 4,147 million lekë (Albanian currency), of which investment in industry, mining, transportation, and agriculture accounts for 86.78 percent. The focus of the two-year plan is on the development of industry and mining. In the second year of the two-year plan, investment in industry and mining increased more than twelve times compared to 1946.
  Construction Projects of the Two-Year Plan
    The two-year plan is formulated according to Albania's specific needs and conditions. I visited the Stalin Textile Factory, the first major construction project in the two-year plan. Construction of the Stalin Textile Factory began in August last year and is expected to be completed by July 1951, when the two-year plan is completed. After the factory starts production, 21,000 spindles can produce 20 million square meters of cloth per year, which can provide each Albanian with 20 square meters of clothing material per year. In this factory, from the director to the ordinary workers, and the volunteer construction team members who lined up from Tirana on Sundays to help with the work, all worked hard and resolutely strived to complete the factory ahead of schedule. They wanted to wash away forever the shame of "Albania being one of the worst-dressed people in Europe."
    The 25-year-old factory director, Konomi, spoke to me about the factory's production prospects: "The Soviet Union supplies us with machines. As for raw materials, we still export our wool. But we lack cotton. Now the government is encouraging large-scale cotton planting. After the factory starts production next year, we may still need to import some. As for the source of labor, we can draw some from the current construction workers and from the existing few small textile factories in the country. In addition, we plan to encourage urban poor people and rural herders to work in the factory. The factory will improve the workers' living standards as much as possible. Shock workers will be treated with preferential treatment and respect. You can see for yourselves the newly built modern workers' residences, public bathrooms, clubs, and children's schools."
    Other major construction projects in the two-year plan include the Malik sugar refinery, which can produce 10,000 tons of sugar per year, and the Selita hydroelectric power plant near Tirana. Albania's oil refining, leather, cement, timber, oil extraction, shoemaking, and tobacco industries will also increase by one to two times in two years.
    Mining is a relatively well-established enterprise in Albania. After the mines were transferred from Italian capitalists to the hands of the people, the Albanian working people demonstrated amazing wisdom and management capabilities. A large number of workers have become technicians. During the two-year plan, major mining industries have made significant developments. For example, taking 1946 production as 100, in 1949, crude oil production was 124, chromium was 286, copper was 214, and lignite was 204.
    In February 1949, the 36-kilometer-long railway between Tirana and Durrës was opened to traffic. Those textbooks that said Albania had no railways now need to be revised. Now this railway has been extended to Peqin, southeast of Durrës. This year, it is planned to extend it westward from Peqin to Elbasan, and then to lay the Tirana-Elbasan section, connecting all four railways. Albania is rich in asphalt, and several beautiful modern highways have been built in the country. In addition, port construction projects are also underway along the Adriatic coast.
  Advancing with the Assistance of the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    The Soviet Union has provided multifaceted and selfless assistance to Albania after liberation. According to Hoxha's report on the two-year plan, in 1951-52 alone, the Soviet Union will supply Albania with an oil refinery with an annual output of 150,000 tons, a new mining equipment factory, textile and knitting machines and their supplementary tools, 60-kilowatt power generators, etc., as well as technical assistance. At the same time, Albania will also receive Polish cargo ships, diesel engines, and train carriages; Czech automobiles, pumps, instruments, and agricultural machines; Hungarian telegraph and telephone equipment; Romanian carburetors, tunnel supports, cement, and paper; Bulgarian iron wire, communication equipment, and various tools. Albania will export minerals and agricultural products to them. Thanks to the assistance of fraternal countries, coupled with the universally high labor enthusiasm of the liberated Albanian people, Albania's industry is advancing by leaps and bounds.
  The Growing New Countryside
    The completion of land reform created the necessary preconditions for the agricultural cooperative movement. At present, there are a total of 68 agricultural cooperatives in the country, with 2,428 households and 12,870 hectares of land. These agricultural cooperatives strictly stipulate that the cooperative's production income is distributed according to labor, and also stipulate that each member household can privately own land of about five *shi mu* or less, two cattle, fifteen sheep, two pigs, and unlimited poultry.
    We visited the Taubracht agricultural cooperative near Shkodër. Taubracht is a small village with 150 peasant households. Sixty-seven peasant households in the village participated in the agricultural cooperative. The cooperative was reorganized from a commune and now has 213 hectares of land, 23 plows, 31 oxen, 1 combine harvester, 1 threshing machine, 3 lawn mowers, 29 dairy cows, 143 calves, 1,116 sheep, and many poultry and fruit trees. In addition, each member household personally retains one-quarter of a hectare of land and livestock, poultry, etc.
    They planted 70 hectares of wheat, and the rest planted corn, sunflowers, and tobacco. 127 members are divided into two work teams, each team is further divided into three sub-teams, and there is also a livestock team. The income of the members is calculated according to working days. During the busy farming season, each working day is ten hours, and during the slack season, it is nine hours. Each member's annual working days are about 230 to 240 days. The income per working day is 3 kilograms of wheat, 2.5 kilograms of corn, 2.75 kilograms of cow and sheep milk, or 1.5 kilograms of butter, 90 centimeters of wool, and a wage of 32 lekë (Albanian currency).
    Due to the initial use of agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers, the excavation of canals, and, more importantly, the organized collective labor, the yield of crops has increased. For example, in 1937, the wheat yield per hectare was 1.1 tons, and in 1950, it was 1.6 tons. According to the chairman of the cooperative, their goal is to produce 2.4 tons of wheat per hectare, an increase of more than double. This has never happened in Albanian history.
    Albania's agricultural cooperative arable land, plus 17 state-owned farms across the country, accounts for 7 percent of the country's total arable land. For the vast number of peasants, the People's Government helps them increase production through agricultural loans, rewards for land reclamation, and the construction of water conservancy projects. According to Iliaz Reka, Deputy Minister of Agriculture of Albania, 37 million Albanian currency has been issued for agricultural loans this year. At the same time, the law stipulates that forests and lowland reclamation are exempt from tax grain for three years. Due to these measures, the country's arable land is increasing. Taking 1938 as 100, it has increased to 161.5 in 1950.
    We visited the experimental livestock farm in Shkodër, which was established three years ago, and is equipped with all new scientific equipment. The calves raised there gain one kilogram of weight every day. The director proudly said that this record is close to the Soviet Union. Albania, which is famous for its animal products, has great development prospects for animal husbandry.
  A New Life with Culture
    In terms of culture and education, before the war, there were only 634 seven-year schools (complete primary schools) with more than 52,000 students in Albania. By the end of 1949, it had increased to 1,932 schools with more than 197,000 students. Secondary education is also improving. Agricultural, medical, and financial specialized schools have now been established. In Albania, which did not have a single higher education institution before the war, a normal college has now been established. After the completion of the two-year plan, it is also planned to establish a university.
    The status of women has also improved. During the Zog rule, there were a total of 658 female employees in enterprises and public institutions. Now there are 6,652 female workers and 8,527 female employees and teachers in various enterprises. Seventeen women were elected as members of the People's Assembly.
    In terms of public health, in the past, more than 60 percent of Albania's population suffered from malaria. Now, due to river dredging, drainage of stagnant water, and especially the People's Government's active promotion of sanitation facilities, the number of malaria patients has been reduced to less than 20 percent.
  My Impression of New Albania
    On June 6th, everyone was about to leave Albania.
    A ten-day stay is not enough to gain a deeper understanding of a rapidly developing country. When an Albanian friend asked me about my impression of Albania before leaving, the image of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region suddenly appeared in my mind. This is not only because there is also a place of roughly the same area and population on the east coast of the Adriatic Sea, a place with many mountains, producing sheep, and using donkeys for transportation. I was thinking of today's Albania, like our Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in those years, surrounded by enemies on all sides and heavily blockaded. However, the people who hold the power in their own hands show joy and calmness. This joy is because they have gained freedom, and this calmness shows their unlimited confidence in their own strength.
    I told my impression to this Albanian friend. He laughed happily and said to me: "Please bring the blessings of the Albanian people to the great Chinese people. Tell them: On the east coast of the distant Adriatic Sea, they have a small but faithful partner."

　　阿尔巴尼亚十日
    ——阿尔巴尼亚通讯
    新华社驻布拉格记者  陈适五
    五月二十八日，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国举行第二届人民议会的总选举。阿尔巴尼亚记者协会邀请了许多国家的民主记者前往观光。除苏联原有驻阿尔巴尼亚京城地拉那的记者外，应邀前去的有德意志民主共和国、波、捷、匈、罗、保等国报纸的记者，和意大利团结报与法国人道报的记者。记者也随同这个参观团，去到这个年青的人民共和国参观旅行了十天。
  到地拉那去
    我们乘匈苏航空公司每星期两次布达佩斯——地拉那的班机出发。飞机经过南斯拉夫南飞入阿尔巴尼亚，全境大部是山，西部阿尔巴尼亚靠近亚得里亚海，渐趋平坦，可耕地较多，其他沿湖和沿河的地方，都是阿国农业比较发达的区域。
    地拉那出现在群山环抱之中。十二时飞机降落，汽车把大家送到达伊梯旅馆。这个旅馆以附近风景区达伊梯峰得名，它曾经是法西斯统治时代意大利资本家政客和法西斯将军们的别墅，现在已成为人民政府招待外宾的地方了。
  阿尔巴尼亚的过去和现在
    阿尔巴尼亚的历史是一部异族统治的历史。第一次世界大战后名义上虽然独立了，旧王佐格的封建政权依附于意大利，招致了墨索里尼匪徒的入侵。一九四三年意大利投降后，又有纳粹德军的占领。阿尔巴尼亚人民在几世纪的深重苦难中逐渐觉醒，一九四一年阿尔巴尼亚共产党成立后，反法西斯的游击战争立即蓬勃发展，人民游击队曾经在这不到二万九千方公里的国土上，抗击和牵制了近二十万的占领军。最后在苏军的胜利进攻下解放了全国。
    阿尔巴尼亚现在处于南斯拉夫铁托集团、希腊保皇法西斯和意大利帝国主义的四面窥伺之下。但是阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿工人党及其领袖霍查的领导下，正英勇坚定地在几乎没有工业基础的国家内，进行着二年计划的经济建设，给过去文盲占百分之八十三的人民中，带来现代文化的享受。帝国主义者认为阿尔巴尼亚人民落后可欺的日子已经一去不复返了。
  阿尔巴尼亚人民的选举
    选举前夕，地拉那装饰一新。阿尔巴尼亚全国共设一百二十一个选区，每一选区选出代表一人，组成人民议会。阿尔巴尼亚一百十八万一千人口中，大约每一万人有一个代表。
    按照宪法规定，年满十八岁的阿国公民，除犯罪和精神病患者外，不论民族、性别、宗教都有选举权。选举按照普遍、直接、平等和秘密投票的方式进行。为了照顾文盲，选举一律用上面刻有阿国国徽双头鹰的黑色橡皮弹丸代替选票，很像过去中国老解放区农村中“选豆豆”的样子。选举箱有两个，一个是代表民主阵线候选人的，另一个是空白箱。每一个选民必须将手臂在两个选举箱里各伸进去一次，从第一个箱里抽回手臂时，手掌仍须紧握着，然后再伸到第二个箱里去，弹丸究竟投在那一个箱里，只有他自己知道，这样来贯彻秘密投票的精神。我们参观了市区五六个选区，看到从八十岁的老婆婆和刚满选举年龄的青年，对于这一选举方式的运用都很熟练。他们对于本区的候选人都很熟悉。
    广大妇女的参加选举，是这次选举特色之一。在第一○七选区，选民中有百分之六十是妇女。作为土耳其人长期统治的烙印之一，阿国妇女特别是老年妇女中，至今还残留着带面幕的习惯。这次阿尔巴尼亚妇联在竞选运动中所提的口号中，有一个就是“去掉面幕，参加选举”。有许多妇女就在群众大会上当场去掉了面幕。
  转变中的阿尔巴尼亚经济
    解放以前，阿尔巴尼亚的经济完全是殖民地型的经济。在全部工矿投资中，外国资本占百分之七十五点六，阿国与外国合办的占百分之二十二点六，阿人自办的仅占百分之一点八。
    在农业方面，封建地主和贵族统治着广大的乡村。农业生产停留在非常落后和原始的状态。据阿国农业部副部长伊里亚兹·雷加告诉记者，战前占农业人口百分之三的地主富农，占有了全国可耕地的百分之四十，而百分之九十七的中、贫、雇农，则只占有土地百分之六十。
    一九四六年一月十一日阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国宣布成立后，紧张的复兴工作就逐步开始了。经过三年的恢复，阿国经济的面貌已大为改变。去年七月间宣布的二年计划，使阿国开始了历史上规模空前的经济建设，并且提出了“奠定社会主义的基础”的口号。
    二年计划是阿国国民经济改造的计划，是国家工业化的计划。计划中总投资额为四十一亿四千七百万里克（阿币），其中工矿、运输和农业的投资占百分之八十六点七八。二年计划的重心在发展工矿业。在二年计划的第二年，工矿业的投资较一九四六年增加了十二倍以上。
  二年计划的建设事业
    二年计划是按照阿国的具体需要与条件而规定的。记者参观两年计划中的第一个大建设工程——建筑中的斯大林纺织厂。斯大林纺织厂在去年八月开始建筑，预计到一九五一年七月二年计划完成时竣工。工厂开工后，二万一千枚纺锭每年可生产二千万平方公尺的布匹，每年可以供给每一个阿尔巴尼亚人二十平方公尺的衣料。在这个工厂里，从厂长到普通工人，和星期日列队从地拉那来帮助做工的志愿建设队队员，都以紧张的劳动，坚决争取工厂提前竣工，他们要把过去“阿尔巴尼亚是欧洲穿得最不好的人民之一”这一耻辱，永远洗掉。
    二十五岁的厂长科诺米向记者畅谈了工厂的生产的远景：“苏联供给我们机器，至于原料，我们的羊毛还有输出的。但我们缺乏棉花。现在政府正奖励大量种棉，明年工厂开工后，也许还需要输入一部分。劳动力的来源，从现在的建筑工人，从国内现有的少数小型纺织厂中可以抽出一部分，另外我们准备鼓励城市贫民和乡村的牧人到工厂来做工，工厂将尽可能提高工人的生活，突击工人将受到优待和尊敬。你们自己可以看到那正在建筑着的新式的工人住宅、公共浴室、俱乐部和子弟学校。”
    二年计划中其他较大的建设工程，还有每年可产糖一万吨的马里库炼糖厂，地拉那附近的赛里塔水力发电厂等。阿尔巴尼亚的炼油、皮革、水泥、木材、榨油，制鞋和烟草等工业，在二年内也将分别增加一倍到二倍。
    采矿是在阿尔巴尼亚比较有基础的企业。矿山从意大利资本家手中转移到人民手中之后，阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民表现了惊人的智慧和管理能力，成批的工人已变成了技师。在二年计划期间，主要矿业均有重大的发展，如以一九四六年的生产为一百，一九四九年原油的生产是一二四，铬为二八六，铜为二一四，褐煤为二○四。
    一九四九年二月，地拉那——都拉索之间全长三十六公里的铁路实行通车，那些说阿尔巴尼亚没有铁路的教科书，现在都需要修改了。现在这一条铁路已延伸到都拉索东南的北金，今年计划再从北金向西伸展到爱尔巴桑，然后再铺设地拉那到爱尔巴桑段，把四条铁路全部贯通。阿尔巴尼亚盛产地沥青，国内建筑了好几条很美丽的现代化的公路。此外，亚得里亚海沿岸的港口建设工程也在进行中。
  在苏联和人民民主国家的援助下前进
    苏联对解放后的阿尔巴尼亚，提供了多方面的大公无私的帮助。仅据霍查在二年计划报告中所提出的，在一九五一——五二年中，苏联将供给阿国一个年产十五万吨的炼油厂，一个新的采矿设备工厂，纺织机针织机及其补充工具，六十基罗瓦特电力的发电机等等，此外还有技术上的援助。同时，阿国还将获得波兰的货船，柴油引擎，火车车辆；捷克的各种汽车，抽水机，仪器及农业机器等；匈牙利的电报、电话器材；罗马尼亚的碳化器，坑道支木，水泥和纸张；保加利亚的铁丝，通讯器材及各种工具等。阿国将向它们输出矿产及农产品。由于兄弟国家的援助，加上解放了的阿国人民普遍高涨的劳动热情，阿尔巴尼亚的工业正在大步前进着。
  成长中的新农村
    土地改革的完成，给农业合作社运动创造了必要的前提。现在，全国共有六十八个农业合作社，拥有农户二千四百二十八户，占地一万二千八百七十公顷。这些农业合作社一方面严格规定一律按劳动力分配合作社生产所得，同时也规定了每一户社员可以私有约合五市亩以下的土地、两头牛、十五只羊、两只猪和无限的家禽。
    我们访问了斯库特里附近的陶布拉契农业合作社。陶布拉契是一个住有一百五十户农民的小村子。村中有六十七户农民参加了农业合作社。合作社是由一个共耕社改组的，现在有土地二百十三公顷，犁二十三具，耕牛三十一头，收割机一台，打谷机一台，割草机三台，乳牛二十九头，牛犊一百四十三头，羊一千一百十六只和许多家禽果树。此外，每一户社员个人保有四分之一公顷的土地及牲畜家禽等。
    他们种了七十公顷的小麦，其余种玉蜀黍、向日葵及烟叶。一百二十七名社员分成两个工作队，每一队又分三个小队，另外还有一队畜牧队。社员的所得按工作日计算，农忙季节每一工作日为十小时，农闲时九小时。每一社员每年的工作日约为二百三十到二百四十日。每一工作日所得是小麦三公斤，玉蜀黍二公斤半，牛羊乳二公斤点七五，或奶油一公斤半，羊毛九十公分，和工资三十二里克（阿币）。
    由于开始使用了农业机器和化学肥料，开凿了水渠，更由于有组织的集体劳动，农作物的产量提高了。例如，一九三七年小麦每公顷产量为一点一吨，一九五○年是一点六吨。据合作社主席说，他们的目标是每公顷产二点四吨的麦子，即增产一倍以上。这是在阿国历史上从来不曾有过的事。
    阿尔巴尼亚的农业合作社耕地加上全国十七个国营农场，共占有全国可耕地的百分之七。对于广大农民，人民政府通过农贷、奖励垦荒和兴修水利工程等方法，来帮助他们增加生产。据阿农业部副部长伊里亚兹·雷加谈，今年已发放农贷三千七百万阿币。同时，法律规定森林及低地垦荒三年免征税粮。由于这些措施，全国可耕地在增加着，如以一九三八年为一百，则一九五○年已增为一六一点五了。
    我们参观了斯库特里创办了三年的实验畜牧场，那里全是新式的科学设备。所养的牛犊每天增加体重一公斤。场长自豪地说这个纪录和苏联接近了。以畜产著名的阿尔巴尼亚，畜牧业已有了很大的发展前途。
  有文化的新生活
    在文化教育方面，战前阿国全国只有七年学校（完全小学）六百三十四所，学生五万二千余名，到一九四九年底已增至一千九百三十二所学校和十九万七千余名学生。中等教育也在增进中，现在又办了农、医和财政等专科学校，在战前没有一所高等教育机关的阿国，现在也办了一所师范学院。在二年计划完成后，还计划创办一所大学。
    妇女的地位也提高了，佐格统治时代企业和公共机关中女职员总共六百五十八人。现在各企业中的女工有六千六百五十二人，女职员和女教师八千五百二十七人。有十七名妇女当选为人民议会的议员。
    公共卫生方面，过去阿国疟疾患者占人口百分之六十以上，现在因为河道疏通，积水排除，特别是人民政府积极推展卫生设施，疟疾患者已减少到百分之二十以下了。
  新阿尔巴尼亚给我的印象
    六月六日，大家要离开阿尔巴尼亚了。
    十天的逗留，要想较深刻地了解一个在急遽地发展着的国家是不可能的。临行的时候，一位阿尔巴尼亚朋友问起我游阿的印象时，我的脑子里突然浮现出陕甘宁边区的形象来，这不仅是因为在这亚德里亚海的东岸上，也有这么一块面积人口等约略相同的地方，多山，产羊和用毛驴子代步的地方。我想到的是今天的阿尔巴尼亚，也像当年我们的陕甘宁边区那样，受着敌人四面的包围，重重的封锁，但是，把政权掌握在自己手里的人民，却表现着愉快和镇静，这种愉快是因为获得了自由，这种镇静说明对于自己力量的无限信心。
    我把我的印象告诉了这位阿尔巴尼亚朋友，他高兴的大笑起来，向我说：“请把阿尔巴尼亚人民的祝福带给伟大的中国人民吧。告诉他们：在遥远的亚德里亚海的东岸上，他们有着一个小小的但是忠实的伙伴。”
