　　The Growth of People's Savings Undertakings
　　Wang Jingran
　　I
　　In national economic construction, concentrating vast amounts of funds for planned use in production is one of the important tasks of the state bank. To achieve this task, in addition to implementing the treasury system, practicing cash management, and adopting various methods to absorb general deposits, developing savings undertakings to accumulate the scattered funds in the hands of the broad masses of the people is also a very important means. Article 37 of the Common Program explicitly stipulates: "The People's Government should take necessary measures to encourage people's savings... to be invested in industry and other production undertakings" to develop the national economy and improve the people's living standards.
　　First of all, we should point out that the savings undertaking in a New Democratic society is essentially different from the savings undertaking in a capitalist society: the savings undertaking in a capitalist society is controlled by financial institutions controlled by monopoly capitalists. The savings deposits obtained from the general public through deceptive methods are either used for speculation in commodity and financial markets, or used to supply industrial capitalists as a means of extracting surplus value and pursuing high profits. Therefore, whether directly or indirectly, they are harmful to the general public, especially the working people. Secondly, the savings undertaking in a New Democratic society is also different from the savings undertaking under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang: at that time, the four major families manipulated the main financial institutions with one hand and controlled the main production undertakings with the other. The people's savings deposits were used as a means of extracting the people to satisfy their greed. This is the same in nature as the capitalist society's practice of extracting the laboring people through savings deposits, but to an even greater extent. On the other hand, the reactionary government did not hesitate to use high inflation as the main method of plundering the people's wealth. Therefore, the more savings deposits, the deeper the exploitation suffered. The failure to resolve the pre-war deposit problem to this day is a bloody iron proof (Note: The People's Government is handling this evil consequence left over by the reactionaries with extreme caution). Today, the people themselves have seized power. There are no monopoly capitalists here, let alone the four major families. The people's savings undertaking aims to serve the people. Through it, the state can concentrate funds for economic construction, and the people can accumulate income to prevent unexpected needs. Whether viewed in the long term or in the short term, it is beneficial to the people.
　　The superior nature of the people's savings undertaking can be seen from its development process.
　　At the beginning of the liberation of various places, the trend of rising prices could not be ended for a while, and the people still valued goods over currency. Under such circumstances, the People's Bank created real value savings deposits to protect the actual purchasing power of salary-earning classes, guide floating capital to production undertakings, and reduce the pressure of floating capital on prices. Because the real value method can closely connect with the interests of the broad masses of the people, it has been praised by the general public after its opening. Taking Shanghai as an example: from November 23 to 26 last year, it received more than 2,448,000 units of savings (excluding offices) in four days. Calculated at the price at that time, it could buy 59,000 piculs of medium white rice, or 2,340 pieces of 21-count Shuangma yarn. From February 24 to 28 this year, it received more than 7,785,000 units of savings in five days, equivalent to 188,700 piculs of medium white rice, or 6,982 pieces of 21-count Shuangma yarn. It played a certain role in contracting currency and reducing price increases at that time.
　　Since March this year, the People's Government has unified financial and economic management, and prices have generally tended to stabilize. Real value savings are no longer valued by the general public, but people still have hesitation about whether prices can remain stable in the long term. Therefore, the People's Bank promptly opened "flexible fixed deposit" and "principal and value guarantee" savings businesses, using the "two conveniences" (fixed deposit interest, current deposit convenience) and "double guarantee" (if the price rises at the time of withdrawal, the principal and interest will be paid in real value; if the price falls, the principal and interest will be paid in currency) methods to increase depositors' confidence. The Tianjin branch received more than 20 billion yuan on the day it opened flexible fixed deposit. In Shanghai branch, "principal and value guarantee" and "flexible fixed deposit" accounted for nearly 60% of the total deposits in May, June and July, which shows that it is very popular.
　　With the long-term stabilization of prices and the service spirit of the People's Bank being recognized by a wider range of people, new situations have emerged in the savings undertaking: First, real value savings have decreased, and currency savings have gradually increased. In the initial stage of opening savings in various parts of the country, real value depositors accounted for almost 90% or even all of them, but by July this year, currency depositors accounted for 54.35%, real value depositors only accounted for 6.61%, and the remaining 39.04% were principal and value guarantee; in other words, currency deposits were more than eight times that of real value deposits. In Shanghai, real value savings were eight times that of currency savings in October last year, but by July this year, currency savings jumped to 25 times that of real value savings. This shows that the people have full confidence in their government, their bank, and their currency, and have ideologically got rid of the concern about currency depreciation. Second, in terms of the deposit period, "short-term" and "current" savings deposits have gradually decreased, while "long-term" and "fixed" deposits are gradually increasing. According to the statistics of 30 provincial and municipal branches as of the end of July, "fixed" deposits accounted for 58% of the total savings deposits, and current deposits accounted for 42%; according to the statistics of the Shanghai branch, in February this year, there were only three types of deposit periods: seven days, half a month, and one month, and none of them exceeded one month. Moreover, those with a term of seven days accounted for 74.5% of the total savings. By July, although the interest rate had been lowered, there were new deposit periods of three, four, six, and seven months, and even one or two years. Among them, those with a deposit period of two to six months accounted for almost half of the total, ranking first.
　　All of the above shows that the people's savings undertaking does meet the needs of the masses and conforms to the laws of objective situation development. In the past year, due to the sincere spirit of serving the people of the staff of the People's Bank in handling savings business, going out of the counter, approaching the masses, expanding institutions, and vigorously attracting deposits, the people's savings undertaking has laid a solid foundation and has steadily grown stronger.
　　II
　　With the large-scale liberation of productive forces with the land reform in the vast rural areas; With the development of urban industrial production and the smooth flow of trade between urban and rural areas, the living standards of the people of the new China will inevitably gradually improve along with the increase in labor remuneration. In this way, the people's savings undertaking will inevitably face a broad future. This objective fact may have different estimates in time and degree, but the direction of its development cannot be denied by anyone. Therefore, how to actively promote it early, in a planned and step-by-step manner, so that this new people's savings undertaking can rapidly grow stronger and fulfill its certain historical mission in production and construction, is one of the important tasks of the financial industry today. But how should it be strengthened?
　　First, we should strengthen the collection of currency savings deposits: because in today's stable prices, people generally value currency savings, we should improve our practices in this regard, such as unifying regulations, simplifying procedures, strengthening publicity, and meeting the needs of the masses, which are very important.
　　Second, seek to expand the scope: appropriately and selectively add specialized institutions, widely set up agencies, promote the entrustment method, focus on cities, and conduct trials in special product areas and wealthy areas in a planned and step-by-step manner, and then gradually penetrate into the countryside.
　　Third, carry out service-oriented businesses: According to Shanghai's experience, service-oriented businesses such as paying wages, paying house donations, water, electricity, and gas fees on behalf of others can expand the source of savings. With the gradual increase in personnel, it should be gradually increased.
　　Fourth, run prize-winning savings: Because prices have basically stabilized at present, depositors have no worries about currency depreciation. If there is also the encouragement of bonuses, it will undoubtedly be more encouraging to savings. Taking the Soviet Union as an example, they have a current account check savings, which is drawn every certain period. For every 1,000 accounts, there are 25 lottery tickets. The first prize (one ticket) is 200 times the average savings amount for six months, the second prize (two tickets) is 100 times, and the other 22 tickets are all 50 times. Based on this experience and combined with the actual situation, we believe that the specific methods of prize-winning savings should pay attention to:
　　(1) You can take the method of issuing savings lottery tickets or giving prizes to depositors' savings at regular intervals.
　　(2) The amount of the first prize should not be too different from the general prize.
　　(3) The number of prize-winning tickets should not be too small, and should maintain a certain proportion to the total number of tickets (number of depositors).
　　(4) If it is issuing prize-winning savings, the face value should not be too large in order to expand the sales surface.
　　The above are of course some preliminary opinions, and we hope that comrades in various places will discover more detailed and better methods in actual experience.

　　人民储蓄事业的成长
    王静然
    一
    在全国经济建设中，集中巨量资金以便于有计划的使用于生产事业，是国家银行的重要任务之一；为达成此一任务，除贯彻金库制度、实行现金管理以及采取各种办法吸收一般存款外，发展储蓄事业积聚散存在广大人民手中的零散资金，也是一个很重要的手段。共同纲领第三十七条中曾明文规定：“人民政府应采取必要的办法，鼓励人民储蓄……投入工业及其他生产事业”，以发展国民经济，提高人民的生活水平。
    首先我们应该指出，新民主主义社会中的储蓄事业与资本主义社会的储蓄事业在本质上是有所不同的：资本主义社会的储蓄事业，掌握在垄断资本家所控制的金融机构中，其由一般人民手中用欺骗方法所得来的储蓄存款，或用于商品、金融市场上的投机，或用以供给产业资本家作为榨取剩余价值、追逐高度利润的手段，故无论直接、间接，都是有害于一般人民、尤其是劳动人民的。其次、新民主主义社会的储蓄事业与国民党反动统治下的储蓄事业也是不同的：那时候四大家族一只手操纵了主要的金融机构，一只手把持着主要的生产事业，人民的储蓄存款，被用为榨取人民以满足其贪欲的手段，这在性质上与资本主义社会借储蓄存款榨取劳动人民的作法相同，而在程度上则尤有甚者；另一方面，反动政府更不惜以高度的通货膨胀，作为搜括人民财富的主要方法，故储蓄存款愈多，所受剥削也愈深，战前存款问题之至今仍未能解决，便是一个充满了血泪的铁证（按：人民政府正以极谨慎的态度来处理反动派所遗留下来的这个恶果）。到今天，人民自己掌握了政权，这里没有垄断资本家，更没有四大家族，人民的储蓄事业以服务人民为目的，透过它，国家可集中资金从事经济建设，人民可积蓄所得以防意外之需，无论从长期看，从短期看，都是于人民有利的。
    人民储蓄事业优越的本质，可从其发展过程中看出来。
    在各地解放之初，物价上涨的趋势一时未能结束，人民仍重货轻币，在这种情况下，人民银行便创办折实储蓄存款以保障薪给阶级实际的购买力，引导游资走向生产事业，并减轻游资对物价的压力。由于折实办法能密切联系广大人民的利益，故开办后极为社会一般人士所赞许。以上海为例：去年十一月二十三至二十六四天中，即收储二、四四八、○○○余单位（办事处尚未在内），按当时物价计算，可买中白粳五九、○○○石，或二十一支双马纱二、三四○件；今年二月二十四至二十八五天内收储七、七八五、○○○余单位，折中白粳达一八八、七○○石，或二十一支双马纱六、九八二件。在当时收缩通货，减杀物价涨势上是起了一定作用的。
    今年三月以后，人民政府统一财经管理，物价普趋稳落，折实储蓄已不为一般人所重视，但人们对物价仍有“是否能长期稳定下去？”的犹豫思想。于是人民银行又及时开办“定活两便”和“保本保值”等储存业务，借“两便”（定期之利，活期之便）、“双保”（取时物价涨，折实付本息，物价落、货币付本息）的办法，增加存户的信心。天津分行在举办定活两便存款之当天，即收储二百多亿；上海分行今年五、六、七月份中“保本保值”、“定活两便”两项存款占总存数近达百分之六十，足见其受人欢迎。
    随着物价的长期趋稳与人民银行的服务精神之为更广大的人士所认识，储蓄事业又出现了新的情况：第一、折实性质的储蓄递减，货币性质的储蓄渐增。全国各地在开办储存初期，存折实者差不多都占到百分之九十以上，甚至全部，但到了今年七月，货币性质者已占百分之五十四点三五，折实的只有百分之六点六一，其余百分之三九点零四是保本保值的；换言之，即货币的为折实的八倍多。上海在去年十月间，折实储蓄为货币储蓄的八倍，至今年七月，货币储蓄竟一跃而为折实储蓄的二十五倍。这就说明人民对自己的政府、自己的银行和自己的货币已有了充分的信心，在思想上已摆脱货币贬值的顾虑。第二、就存款期限来说，“短期”与“活期”的储蓄存款已逐渐减少，“长期”“定期”者则正逐渐加多。根据三十个省市分行截至七月底为止的统计，“定期”者占全部储蓄存额百分之五八，活期者占百分之四二；又据上海分行统计，今年二月储存的期限，只有七天，半月，一月等三种，没有超过一月以上的，而且在总储额中为期七天者占达百分之七十四·五。到七月份，利率虽已降低，而新增存期中，却有三、四个月的，六、七个月的，甚至有一年、两年的，其中存二月至六月者几占总数之半，跃居第一位。
    以上种种，都说明人民的储蓄事业，确是适应群众需要与符合客观情势发展规律的。一年以来，由于人民银行办理储蓄业务的工作人员能本着为人民服务的真挚精神，走出柜台，接近群众，扩充机构，大力揽存，使人民的储蓄事业打下了坚固的基础，而且已稳步地壮大起来了。
    二
    随着广大农村土改工作的进行，生产力大规模的得到解放；随着城市工业生产的发展，城乡贸易的畅通，新中国人民的生活水平，必将伴同劳动报酬的递增而慢慢提高起来。这样，人民储蓄事业亦必将面临一个广阔的前途。这一客观事实，在时间上程度上容或有不同的估计，但其发展的方向，当非任何人所能否定。因此如何及早有计划有步骤的加以积极的推动，使此一新生的人民储蓄事业能迅速更加壮大起来，在生产建设中尽其一定的历史使命，乃是金融业当前的重要任务之一。但是究应如何加强呢？
    第一，应当加强货币储蓄存款的揽收：因为在物价稳定的今天，一般人都已看重货币储蓄，我们就应在这方面改善作法，如统一章程，简化手续，加强宣传，适应群众需要，都是很要紧的。
    第二，求得面的扩展：适当重点地增设专办，广设代理机构，推广委托办法，抓紧城市，有计划、有步骤的自特产区、富庶区先行试办，再逐渐的深入农村中去。
    第三，举办服务性业务：根据上海经验，服务性的业务如代发薪金、代付房捐、水电、煤气费等，是可以扩充储存来源的，在人员逐渐增多情况下，应逐渐增加之。
    第四，办理有奖储蓄：由于目前物价已基本趋稳，存款者已无货币贬值的顾虑，如果再有奖金的鼓励，无疑是更能鼓励储蓄的。以苏联为例，他们有一种活期支票储蓄，每隔一定时期，开奖一次，每一千个户头中可有二十五张奖券，头奖（一张）奖额为其六个月来的平均储额的二○○倍，二奖（二张）为一○○倍，其他二十二张，都是五十倍。根据此一经验，结合现实的情况，我们觉得有奖储蓄的具体办法，应该注意到：
    （１）可采取发行储蓄奖券或定期按存户储款给奖的办法。
    （２）头奖奖额不要过于与一般奖悬殊。
    （３）有奖张数不可过少，应与总张数（存户数）保持一定比例。
    （４）如果是发行有奖储蓄，则面额不要太大，以扩大推销面。
    以上所述，当然都是些初步的意见，其更详尽更妥善的办法，还希望各地工作同志在实际经验中去发现。
