Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th (TASS): Today, all newspapers published editorials commenting on the Second All-Soviet Peace Congress, which opened on October 16th. *Pravda*'s editorial stated: The Second All-Soviet Peace Congress opened yesterday in the Hall of Columns of the Trade Union Building in Moscow. At the first meeting of the Congress, representatives of all Soviet nationalities, in an atmosphere of complete unity and heightened patriotic sentiment, expressed the unified will of the Soviet people to strive for lasting peace and friendship between all countries.

The Soviet people's contributions to humanity are great, and their contribution to the struggle for lasting world peace is invaluable. During the years of World War II, the Soviet people, with their unprecedented heroic deeds, saved world civilization from the hands of the fascist bandits. Our country leads a powerful and increasingly strong democratic and anti-imperialist camp, advancing in the forefront of the international peace movement.

The whole world knows that the Soviet Union has consistently strived for peace with all countries and has fought unyieldingly for peace and against warmongers. The wise diplomatic policy of Lenin and Stalin and the Soviet Union's consistent and resolute struggle for peace and cooperation between nations have won our country the sympathy and support of hundreds of millions of people in all countries. The Soviet Union, under the leadership of the great Stalin, is the vanguard in the struggle of working people for lasting world peace.

One hundred fifteen million five hundred fifty-one thousand four hundred seventy-three Soviet citizens—the entire adult population of the Soviet Union—have signed the Stockholm Appeal. This unanimity of the Soviet people has demonstrated to all progressive humanity that the Soviet Union's commitment to peace is linked to the nature of a socialist country.

The fact that our country has carried out large-scale economic and cultural construction in the post-war period most convincingly proves the Soviet people's efforts to achieve peace.

The Soviet example inspires the peaceful and creative labor of the people of various countries who have embarked on the road of building a new life. Hundreds of millions of working people in China and the people's democracies advance alongside the Soviet Union in the first ranks of the world's peace fighters.

The peace movement is a powerful movement in our time. In the struggle against the conspiracies of the imperialist warmongers, this movement is growing and expanding, and its strength is becoming increasingly powerful. People of all nationalities are vigilantly guarding against the plans of the imperialists who have embarked on the arms race. In the United States and the United Kingdom, France, and other capitalist countries that follow in its footsteps, new armament plans that have been announced have reached legendary figures, terms of military service are being extended, and the European army is being rapidly reorganized according to the American system. Fascists and militarists in West Germany and Japan are being recruited into the army. The American ruling clique is hastily piecing together an aggressive bloc, with its spearhead aimed at peace-loving people.

However, the era in which the imperialists could provoke countries to fight each other with impunity, incite hatred and animosity among them, and destroy several million people has gone forever. The common people of all countries have learned from their own experience who are their enemies, who are their friends, and who are preparing for war and who are defending the cause of peace. The Soviet people are filled with the determination to fight for lasting peace and against warmongers, and their powerful voice will resound throughout the world from the rostrum of the Second All-Soviet Congress in Support of Peace. The people of all nationalities in our country unanimously approve and support the "Declaration on Eliminating the Threat of a New War and Strengthening International Peace and Security" proposed by the Soviet delegation at the United Nations General Assembly session.

We support peace and we must defend the cause of peace! These are the words Comrade Stalin once said, and these are the words that the entire Soviet people will say.

*Izvestia*'s editorial
*Izvestia* stated in its editorial that the Second All-Soviet Congress in Support of Peace has been convened under such conditions that the peace camp, headed by the freedom-loving Soviet people, has been infinitely developed and strengthened. The peace movement has truly become the most important and invincible movement of our era.

The eyes of the people of all continents are cast upon this great peace-loving country, regarding it as a torch illuminating the road to peace and happiness. All of working humanity is deeply grateful to the Soviet people, to the great leader and teacher of the working people, Comrade Stalin, for their resolute struggle against war and for lasting peace and international friendship. Peace and creative labor, these are the thoughts and aspirations of the Soviet people, and they contribute their creative efforts to achieve this goal. Now, peaceful construction projects are being carried out on an unparalleled scale within the Soviet Union according to the great Stalin's plans, which powerfully illustrates this point.

The Soviet people are all dedicated to peaceful labor. The Soviet people are building the bright world of communism with giant strides. The hearts of the Soviet people are filled with a unique and common desire—to work and build communism in peace.

The people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union frankly and sincerely expressed their lofty goal—to block the road to war, defend the sacred cause of peace, and strengthen and expand cooperation among all peace-loving people. Workers, peasants, scientists, and cultural workers are further consolidating the strength of the Soviet motherland, the base of international peace and friendship, with new labor achievements. They respond to the warmongers' conspiracies with this action.

*Izvestia* concluded by stating that no matter how arrogant the warmongers may be, the power is not on their side, but on the side of the powerful peace camp.

　　苏联保卫和平的坚决的斗争获得亿万人民的同情与支持
    真理报消息报评苏联和平大会开幕
    真理报社论
     【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十七日电：今日各报均发表以社论评述十月十六日开幕的第二届全苏和平大会。真理报社论说：第二届全苏和平大会昨天在莫斯科工会大厦圆柱大厅中开幕了。在大会的第一次会议中，苏联各民族的代表们在完全一致和爱国情绪高涨着的气氛中表示了苏联人民为争取持久和平和各国间友谊而斗争的统一的意志。
    苏联人民对人类的功绩是伟大的，他们对争取持久的世界和平的斗争的贡献是无价的。在二次世界大战的几年中，苏联人民以他们空前的英雄事迹把世界文明从法西斯强盗手中拯救出来。我国领导着一个强大的力量正在日益增长壮大中的民主反帝国主义阵营。在国际和平运动的前列前进。
    全世界都知道，苏联一贯地和一切国家努力争取和平，不屈不挠地为争取和平及反对战争贩子而斗争。列宁斯大林的明智外交政策和苏联为争取和平及各国间合作所进行的一贯而坚决的斗争，已使我国获得一切国家亿万人民的同情和支持。在伟大的斯大林领导下的苏联，是劳动人民争取全世界持久和平斗争中的先锋队。
    苏联公民一亿一千五百五十一万四千七百零三人——苏联全部成年人口——已在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名了。苏联人民的这个一致性已向整个进步人类证明，苏联对和平的忠诚是与社会主义国家的性质结合着的。
    我国在战后时期已进行大规模经济和文化建设这一事实，最令人信服地证明了苏联人民争取和平的努力。
    苏联的范例鼓舞了已走向建设新生活道路的各国人民的和平及创造性劳动。中国和各人民民主国的亿万劳动人民一道和苏联在世界和平战士的第一行列中前进。
    和平运动是我们时代中的强大运动。在反对帝国主义战争贩子的阴谋的斗争中，这运动在增长和扩大，其力量日益强大。各族人民正在警惕地防备着已经走上军备竞赛路程的帝国主义者的计划。在美国和继其后尘的英、法及其他资本主义国家中，已公布的新的军备计划达到了传奇的数字，兵役期限正在延长着，欧洲陆军正被迅速地仿照着美国的制度加以整编。西德和日本的法西斯和军国主义分子正被征入陆军。美国统治集团正在急忙拼凑起侵略集团，以矛头指向爱好和平的人民。
    但是，帝国主义者可以不受惩罚地挑拨各国互相斗争、煽动它们之间的仇恨与敌意并毁灭若干百万人民的时代已经永远过去了。一切国家的平民已经由他们自己的经验中知道谁是他们的敌人，谁是他们的朋友，谁正在准备战争谁正在保卫和平事业。苏联人民充满着为持久和平、反对战争贩子而斗争的决心，他们强有力的呼声将自第二届全苏拥护和平大会的讲坛上响遍全世界。我国各族人民一致赞成并拥护苏联代表在联合国大会会议上所提出的“消除新战争威胁、巩固国际和平与安全的宣言”。
    我们拥护和平并且要保卫和平事业！这是斯大林同志曾经说过的话，而且也就是苏联全体人民要说的话。
    消息报社论
    消息报在其社论中称，第二届全苏拥护和平大会已在这样的条件下召开了，即以爱好自由的苏联人民为首的和平阵营已经无限地发展和加强了。和平运动已经真正变成了我们这一时代最重要的和不可征服的运动。
    世界各洲人民的目光都投向这个伟大的爱好和平的大国，认为它是照耀着和平和幸福道路的火炬。全体劳动人类都深深地感激苏联人民，感激劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师斯大林同志，感谢他们为反对战争、争取持久和平和国际间友谊而进行的坚决斗争。和平和创造性的劳动，这就是苏联人民的思想和愿望，他们贡献他们创造性的努力来达成这个目的。现在，苏联国内正根据伟大的斯大林的计划以无比的规模进行着和平建设的工程，这便有力地说明了这一点。
    苏联人民都献身于和平劳动中。苏联人民正在以巨人的步伐建设共产主义的光明世界。苏联人民的心灵中充满着唯一而共同的愿望——在和平中工作和建设共产主义。
    苏联各族人民坦率地忠诚地表示了他们崇高的目的——阻塞走向战争的道路，保卫神圣的和平事业，加强和扩大爱好和平的各族人民之间的合作。工人、农民、科学家和文化工作者们正在以新的劳动业迹来进一步巩固苏维埃祖国这个国际和平和友谊的基地的力量。他们以这个行动来答复战争贩子的阴谋。
    消息报在结语中称，不管战争贩子们怎样嚣张，力量并不在他们那一边，而是在强大的和平阵营这一边的。
