　　The Birth of New People
    In the audience of the congress of combat heroes and the congress of model workers, I listened all day to the typical reports of the hero representatives, and I couldn't help but feel a strong shock in my heart. Again and again, I secretly wiped away tears of joy and gratitude. From the bright spotlights, I greedily watched their faces. They were all ordinary, commonplace faces of working people, the kind you could see in any workplace: simple, honest, people who quietly engage in all kinds of labor. But as if they were ordinary working people chatting about farming and family matters, they reported the earth-shattering, history-making, magical deeds. They disarmed the enemy with their bare hands, they captured entire battalions of armed enemies single-handedly, they persisted under fierce artillery fire for days and nights without rest, they swam in the vast ocean for dozens of hours, they displayed a spirit of courage and tenacity that ordinary people could not even imagine, and overcame indescribable hardships. It is this spirit, this power, that has created our people's victorious history.
    After the October Revolution, the Soviet Union produced a new type of person, generally called Soviet people. They were, of course, still ordinary people with flesh and blood, who needed to eat and drink, but their flesh and blood were closely linked with the entire working people, with the entire cause of the people. They had no individual gains or losses, no individual likes or dislikes. They devoted everything to the cause of the people, and they only cared about the gains and losses of the people's cause. Therefore, the enormous power of love and hatred of the entire working people was embodied in their individual persons, enabling them to exert a steely power that no individual could possibly exert. This kind of person is what Stalin called people made of special material.
    In these combat heroes, in these model workers, we are facing this new type of person, the new people of the new China, with flesh and blood. A new type of person, made of special material, is being born before our eyes. They are not a small number of extraordinary people, they are hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands emerging into the struggle of our people's cause. Their birth is not accidental. They have inherited the most outstanding and precious traditions of our nation, a tradition that every ordinary person can share. Therefore, every ordinary person of us today can become a hero, but the heroes are no longer ordinary people. They are people who have been liberated from the shackles of the selfishness of the old humanity. They have completely new views and ideas, and even their instinctive feelings are completely new. When a female hero told me that she found her ribs were broken, she did not tell anyone, and still insisted on carrying the stretcher across the river, she had to complete her task. She just thought: what is my sacrifice compared to the sacrifices suffered by the brothers on the battlefield? Even the pain felt in her body and flesh was felt together with the entire cause of the people. When a person's emotions reach this level, they have truly risen to the level of a true person, a new person. Without the scientific Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought penetrating into people's flesh and blood, people cannot reach such a height. Rooted deeply in the soil of the people, and receiving the nourishment of the warm sunshine, the earth can bear these flourishing flowers of humanity, to eliminate evil in the world and make the world of man infinitely beautiful.

　　新人的诞生
    在战斗英雄代表大会和劳模代表大会的旁听席上，我整天的听着一个个英雄代表们的典型报告，忍不住心头激烈的震撼，我一次一次偷偷的拭着欢喜感激的眼泪。从强烈的照明灯中，我贪心的注视他们的面容。都是一些普通的平凡的劳动人民的面容，在任何劳动场所上都可以看得到的，朴实、忠厚，默默的从事于一切劳动的人们的面容。可是像普通劳动人民闲话桑麻、诉述家常一样，他们报告出轰轰烈烈的创造历史的神奇的事迹。他们赤手空拳缴夺敌人的武器，他们单人匹马俘虏整营武装的敌人，他们几天几夜不休不眠坚持在猛烈的炮火底下，他们几十小时游泳在汪洋大海中，他们发挥了普通人连想像也不可能的英勇顽强的精神，克服了无法形容的艰难困苦。就是这种精神、这种力量，创造了我们人民胜利的历史。
    十月革命以后，苏联产生一种新人，一般叫做苏维埃人的，这自然还是普通有血有肉、饥食渴饮的人，但他们的血肉是和整个劳动人民、整个人民事业紧紧的结合在一起，没有个人单独的利害得失、没有个人单独的爱憎，他们的一切都献给了整个人民的事业，他们所关心的只有人民事业的利害得失，也因此，整个劳动人民的巨大的爱憎的力量，具现在他们个人的身上，使他们发挥了任何个人都不可能发挥的钢铁般的力量。这种人，也就是斯大林所谓用特殊材料构成的人。
    在这些战斗英雄的身上，在这些劳动模范的身上，我们就面对了这种有血有肉的新中国的新人。一种用特殊材料构成的新人，在我们的眼前诞生了。他们不是少数的特异的人，他们是几百几千几万的涌现到我们人民事业的斗争中来的。他们的诞生也不是偶然的事情，在他们的身上继承了我们民族最优秀最宝贵的传统，这种传统是我们每个普通的平凡的人都可以得到一份的，因此我们每个普通的人，在今天，都可以成为英雄的，但英雄却已经不是普通平凡的人，他们是从旧人类的自私的锁枷底下解放出来的人。他们具有完全新的看法和想法，连本能的感觉，也完全是新的。当一位女英雄告诉我：她发现她的肋骨断了，她没有告诉人，仍旧坚持着把担架抬过河去，她一定要完成她的任务。她只是想：比之战场上兄弟们所遭受的牺牲，我这点牺牲算什么呢？甚至身体血肉上所感受的创痛，她也是和整个人民事业一起感受的。人的感情达到这样的程度，实在已经提高到真正的人、新人的水平。没有科学的马列主义和毛泽东思想渗透在人的血肉里，人是不可能达到这样高度的。深深着根在人民的泥土里，承受着煦和的阳光的照拂，大地上才有这些欣欣向荣的人的花朵，使罪恶在世界消灭，使人的世界变得无限美丽。
