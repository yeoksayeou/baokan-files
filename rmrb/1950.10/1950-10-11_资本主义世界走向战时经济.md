　　The Capitalist World Moves Towards a Wartime Economy
    USSR Mankeyan
    (Part 1)

    Recent events, primarily the American aggression against Korea, have affected the economies of all capitalist countries. The growth of military spending and arms production, the accelerated stockpiling of military strategic materials, and the formulation of militaristic programs are the characteristics of the current situation in the countries of the US-UK bloc. As for the United States, an economy transitioning to a wartime system has already been implemented there.

    American bourgeois public opinion is openly talking about establishing a wartime economy and allocating a budget of fifty to six hundred billion US dollars entirely for military purposes. In the existing budget of the United States, more than 70 percent (approximately 30 billion US dollars) is directly or indirectly used for military purposes. In addition, another 10.5 billion US dollars will be added for the US's own armaments, and 4 billion US dollars will be provided to Wall Street's Western European vassal states for armaments.

    A bill to increase tax revenues by 5 to 10 billion US dollars is being drafted. Two-thirds of this planned amount will be achieved by increasing the income tax of the working people, with only one-third borne by the corporations. In this way, the minimum annual income threshold for taxation is specified to be lowered from 600 US dollars to 500 US dollars.

    The newspapers of the monopoly capitalists, while talking about the huge numbers of these new military appropriations with relish, also emphasize that this is only the beginning, and the expansion of armaments will continue indefinitely. Many newspapers, in a spirit suitable for promoting this proposition, explain to the masses the lessons of MacArthur's setbacks in Korea. They insist that the American armed interventionists failed because of a lack of weapons. They use this method to encourage the expansion of armaments. Fourteen American aircraft companies have already received orders worth 4,327,000,000 US dollars. In addition, General Motors, which manufactures aircraft engines, General Electric, and Westinghouse, which manufacture jet engines, are awaiting large numbers of orders. At the same time, negotiations are underway to convert enterprises that produce railway equipment, Chrysler, and certain enterprises belonging to General Motors into tank production.

    The transformation of American industry due to the War Department's orders will inevitably reduce the production of daily necessities in the short term. The monopoly capitalists calculate that even if automobile production is reduced by 30 to 40 percent and housing construction is reduced by one-third, wartime orders can completely maintain or even exceed the current level of industrial production. The people will of course suffer, but this is something that the ruling group of capitalist America does not care about.

    Bourgeois economists have long calculated that the demand for military steel and zinc will increase three to four times, while aluminum will increase five to six times. According to materials published in the "Daily Metal Reporter" on July 26, by the end of this year, 25 percent of the total steel production will be used for direct military purposes.

    British and American raw material monopolists, anticipating further expansion of armaments, had already begun to raise prices on the major commodity markets of the capitalist world some time ago. This increase is particularly sharp for commodities with military significance. Since the meeting of the foreign ministers of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc in May, the prices of all military strategic materials have risen particularly sharply. Due to the American aggression against Korea, the prices that had already skyrocketed due to wartime inflation received a new impetus.

    According to the Moody's Investors Service commodity price index, prices in the first quarter of 1950 fluctuated between 352 and 362 (with the price index on December 31, 1931, as 100), but a sharp rise began in May. The peak for that month was 393, and it rose to 405 in June and 450 in July. The Dow Jones commodity price index also rose from 148 at the beginning of May to 178 at the end of July. The price index of the London "Economist" magazine rose from 276 a year ago to 400 (with the average of 1935 as 100).

    Because the capitalist world has lost most of its tungsten production areas (previously, China and Korea accounted for more than 60 percent of the world's tungsten production), the price of tungsten has risen by 65 to 75 percent this year. Rubber, 95 percent of which is produced in Southeast Asia, has also risen from 380 US dollars per ton in March to 1,196 US dollars per ton in August. Similarly, because the main source of tin is in Southeast Asia, where the imperialist position is unstable, the price of tin has also shown a sharp rise.

    Parallel to the increase in military spending is the growth of monopoly capital profits. The inflated military budgets of capitalist countries are an excellent "pumping station" that draws billions of dollars from taxpayers' pockets and transfers them to the safes of the financial magnates. The published profit figures of major American companies for the second quarter of 1950 confirm this point. The reports of 321 companies indicate that the current profits are 31.8 percent higher than in the first quarter of this year and 46.5 percent higher than in the second quarter of 1949. Among them, the profits of the aircraft manufacturing industry increased the most, by 117.2 percent, followed by the automobile industry, with 57.9 percent, and the steel industry, with 57.5 percent.

    The sharp increase in the profits of the two largest American monopoly enterprises, General Motors and General Electric, is of particular significance. The latter, which is increasingly becoming an arsenal, has expanded its activities to manufacture atomic weapons, jet aircraft, and other tools of murder. Obviously, for this reason, General Electric's profits in the second quarter of this year increased by 150 percent compared to the second quarter of last year (i.e., from 28 million US dollars to 70 million US dollars). The profits of steel trusts and chemical monopolies have also increased sharply due to the arms race.

    American industrial production rose slowly between March and June of this year, reaching the level of October 1948 in half a year (i.e., the level before the crisis of declining production began a year and a half ago). However, if we do not only look at the index for June, but at all aspects of American economic life in the first half of the year, then there is absolutely no way to talk about any improvement. All basic indicators—the overall level of industrial production, coal production, retail sales, railway freight, investment in the national economy, farmers' income, the growing trend of unemployment, installment payments, and mortgage loans—all indicate that the economic situation in the United States in 1950 was worse than in the second half of 1948. It must be pointed out that the main factors contributing to the increase in production from March to June were the huge military expenditures required in preparation for aggression in the Far East, the payment of veterans' benefits, the replenishment of coal and steel stockpiles depleted by large-scale strikes in various factories and mines, the widespread use of credit, and so on.

    The increase in industrial production occurred under the condition that the decline in farmers' income has continued for the third year and further decreased. Farmers' income in 1948 decreased by 6.2 percent compared to 1947, and in 1949 it decreased by 20 percent compared to 1948, and this year it will obviously decrease by another 7 to 11 percent. The unemployment figures in the United States seemed to have decreased somewhat from March to May, but by July, even the officially published materials showed a resurgence. In agriculture in particular, the number of employed people decreased by 750,000 in one year.

    From March to June 1950, some sectors of the American economy that produce durable goods (such as automobiles, electric refrigerators, television equipment, etc.) seemed to be somewhat active, which was largely due to the bourgeoisie's frenzied enjoyment of consumption, and this consumption is increasing day by day. At the same time, consumer borrowing has also increased significantly. In May alone, it increased by 481 million US dollars to a total of 19.1 billion US dollars, which is 3.25 billion US dollars higher than the level in May 1949. The "easy" credit in the residential construction industry, which has cultivated the speculative fever in the sector, is now beginning to cause tragic consequences. Because there are more and more people who are forced to sell their houses because they are unable to pay the deposit and loan interest on time. The "Wall Street Journal" also had to admit that such foreclosures of real estate were almost 50 percent more in the first quarter of 1950 than last year.

    It cannot be considered accidental that American imperialism launched the aggression against Korea precisely when the increase in industrial production in the United States was about to end. Even many American newspapers have noticed this significant coincidence. The explanation of "US News & World Report" on this point is very interesting. The magazine wrote:

    "Just when people thought that the boom had come to an end, the Korean War brought a new boom."

    After acknowledging that expanding the Korean conflict is of great benefit to monopoly capital, the magazine continued:

    "This is really an ideal situation to maintain commercial activity at a high level. The Korean incident has exorcised the specter of depression that has threatened American entrepreneurs since World War II. The prospect of a long-term boom has emerged."

    When the organ of the American reactionaries calls the American armed intervention in Korea an "ideal situation," it is not just using a humorous phrase, but inadvertently admitting the fact that American monopoly capitalists are particularly interested in the Korean adventure because they need a new stimulus to quickly transition the American economy to a wartime system.

    However, "US News & World Report's" chanting about the "Korean incident burying the specter of crisis" is still in vain. As a tool to escape the crisis, the transformation of the capitalist economy to a wartime system cannot achieve its purpose. As early as March 1939, Comrade Stalin said:

    "...turning the domestic economy to the track of wartime economy is to develop industry in a one-sided military direction, to expand the production of those goods that are specially for the need of war and have nothing to do with the consumption of the residents, to narrow the production of the consumer goods of the residents especially to narrow the sale of the consumer goods of the residents, and thus to reduce the consumption amount of the residents, and to make the country fall into economic crisis."

　　资本主义世界走向战时经济
    苏联  曼努克扬
    （上）
    最近的一些事变，首先是美国对朝鲜的侵略，已使各资本主义国家的经济全部受到了影响。军事支出与武器生产的增长、军事战略物资的加速储存、军国主义纲领的制定，这些就是美英集团各国目前形势的特征。至于说到美国，向战时体制转变的经济已在那里实现了。
    美国资产阶级舆论公开谈论着确立战时经济，并把五六百亿美元预算完全用于军事目的。在美国现有的预算里有百分之七十以上（约三百亿美元）是直接或间接充作军事用途的，此外又要增加一百零五亿美元作为美国本身的武装之用，以四十亿美元供给华尔街西欧各附庸国武装。
    增加五十亿到一百亿美元税收的法案正在制定。这个计划数目中的三分之二将以增加劳动人民所得税的方法完成，只有三分之一才由那些企业公司负担。这样，每年收入的起征点就指明将从六百美元降低到五百美元。
    独占资本的报纸，津津有味地谈到这个新的军事拨款的庞大数字时还强调说，这只是一个开始，军备扩充将无限期地继续下去。许多报纸以适合于宣传这个命题的精神，向群众解释着麦克阿瑟在朝鲜遭受挫折的教训。他们硬说美国武装干涉者之所以失利，是因为缺乏武器。他们就以这种办法鼓励着扩充军备。美国十四个飞机公司已接到价值四十三亿二千七百万美元的订货合同。此外，通用汽车公司——制造飞机引擎的，通用电气公司和西屋电气公司——制造喷气发动机的，也等待着大批定货。同时，使生产铁路器材的企业、克利斯勒汽车公司及属于通用汽车公司的某些企业转变为生产坦克的谈判正在进行着。
    美国工业因陆军部定货而改变工作，在短期内就会不可避免地减少日用必需品的生产。独占资本家们算计着，即使在汽车产量降低百分之三十至四十，房屋建筑缩减三分之一的情况下，战时定货也完全可以使它们保持甚至超过现在的工业生产水平。人民当然要受痛苦，但这是资本主义美国的统治集团并不在意的。
    资产阶级经济学家早已算计到，军用钢和锌的需求会增加三到四倍，而铝则会增加五至六倍。根据七月二十六日出版的“每日五金报导”的材料，到今年年底时，钢的总产量的百分之二十五将用于直接的军事目的。
    英美的原料垄断者，已预计到进一步的扩张军备，因而在若干时间以前就已开始提高资本主义世界主要商品市场的价格了。这种提高，以那些带有军事意义的商品特别显得急剧。自从五月间北大西洋侵略集团的外长会议以后，一切军事战略物资的价格特别猛烈地上涨起来。由于美国对朝鲜的侵略，因战时通货膨胀而暴涨的物价又增加了新的推动力。
    根据莫迪投资公司的物价指数，一九五○年第一季的物价，总是涨落于三五二到三六二之间（以一九三一年十二月三十一日的物价指数为一百），但到五月就已开始了猛烈的上涨。那一个月的最高峰是三九三，到六月时又涨至四○五；七月——四五○。杜·琼斯公司的物价指数从五月初的一四八也涨到七月底的一七八。伦敦“经济学家”杂志的物价指数从一年前的二七六涨到四○○（以一九三五年的平均数为一百）。
    由于资本主义世界已失去了钨的产地的大部（以往中国和朝鲜占世界钨的产量的百分之六十以上），钨的价格在本年度上涨了百分之六十五至七十五。百分之九十五出产在东南亚的橡皮，也由三月份每吨三百八十美元涨到八月份每吨一千一百九十六美元。同样，因为锡的主要来源是在帝国主义地位动荡不定的东南亚，所以锡的价格也表现了猛烈的上涨。
    与增加军事支出并行的，是独占资本利润的增长。资本主义国家膨胀的军事预算是一个绝妙的“抽水站”，它从纳税人的口袋里把数以亿计的金钱汲出来转运到那些财阀们的保险箱里。据公布的美国大公司一九五○年第二季的利润数字就证实着这点。三百二十一家公司的报告指明，现在的利润要较今年第一季提高百分之三一·八；较一九四九年第二季提高百分之四六·五。其中又以飞机制造业的利润增长最多，为百分之一一七·二；汽车工业次之，为百分之五七·九；钢铁业为百分之五七·五。
    美国两个最大的独占企业——通用汽车公司和通用电气公司的利润的锐增，是具有特殊意义的。后者越发变为兵工厂，已扩大其活动而制造原子武器、喷气式飞机及其他杀人工具了。显然，由于这种缘故，通用电气公司的利润，今年第二季要比去年第二季增长百分之一百五十（即从二千八百万美元增加为七千万美元）。钢铁托辣斯和化学独占企业的利润，也因军备竞赛的缘故而激烈增加。
    美国的工业生产，在今年三月到六月之间是缓慢上升的，半年中已到达一九四八年十月间的水平（即继续了一年半的生产下降的危机开始前的水平）。然而，如果我们不单看六月份的指数，而是看一看上半年美国经济生活的各方面，那就绝对谈不到有什么改善。所有一切基本的指数——工业生产的总水平、煤的产量、零售额、铁路货运、国民经济中的投资、农民的收入、失业的增长趋势、分期付款与抵押借贷，都说明着美国一九五○年的经济情况较之一九四八年后半年更恶化了。于此必须指出，使三月到六月间生产表现增加的主要因素，乃是由于因准备侵略远东所需的巨额军事支出；支付退伍军人的津贴；补充储存因各厂矿的大规模罢工而将用尽的煤和钢；信用的广泛利用以及其他等等。
    工业生产的提高，是发生在农民收入的减低已继续进入第三年并更加降低的条件之下的。一九四八年农民的收入比一九四七年降低百分之六·二，而一九四九年又比一九四八年降低百分之二十，今年很明显还将再降低百分之七至十一。美国的失业数字从三月到五月这一时期似乎有某些减少，但到七月份，即连官方公布的材料中也可看出又在重新增长。特别是农业，就业人数在一年之间就减少了七十五万。
    一九五○年的三月至六月，美国经济中生产耐用品（如汽车，电气冰箱，电视设备等）的某些部门曾显得有些活跃，这大半是由于资产阶级疯狂享受的消费，而且这种消费还在与日俱增。但同时，消费者的借贷也显著地增加了。单是五月份就增长了四亿八千一百万元而达到总数一百九十一亿美元的数字，即超出一九四九年五月份水平达三十二亿五千万美元。住宅建筑业中养成该部门的投机狂热的“轻易”信用，现在开始引起了悲惨的后果。因为无力依期缴纳押金及借款利息而被迫出卖房屋的愈来愈多。“华尔街日报”也不得不承认，这种不动产断押的事情在一九五○年第一季几乎较去年要多百分之五十以上。
    恰恰在美国的工业生产量上升将告终止的时候，美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜，这一点是不能认为偶然的。甚至很多美国报纸也都注意到了这个有意义的巧合。“美国新闻与世界报导”关于这点的说明很值得玩味。该杂志写道：
    “正当人们以为景气已告终止的时候，朝鲜战事却带来了新的景气。”
    在承认扩大朝鲜冲突对独占资本大有利益之后，该杂志继续说：
    “这真是一种使商业活动维持一个高度水平的如意局面。朝鲜事件把第二次世界大战之后就威胁着美国企业家的萧条的魔影祓除了。长期景气的远景出现了。”
    当美国反动派的机关刊物把美国在朝鲜的武装干涉称作：“如意局面”时，这就不仅是用了一句诙谐的话，而是不经心地承认了这一事实，即美国独占资本家之对朝鲜冒险特别发生兴趣，是因为他们需要以新的刺激使美国经济迅速转上战时体制。
    然而，“美国新闻与世界报导”关于“朝鲜事件埋葬了危机的魔影”的吟诵依然是徒劳的。作为逃避危机的工具，资本主义经济之向战时体制转变，是达不到目的的。还在一九三九年三月，斯大林同志就说过：
    “……把国内经济转上战时经济轨道，就是使工业循着片面的军事的趋向发展，极力扩大专供战争需要而与居民消费无关的那些物品的生产，极力缩小居民消费品的生产，特别是缩小居民消费品的出售，因而缩减居民的消费额，使国家陷入经济危机。”
