　　North China Provinces and Cities and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    Peace Signature Target Exceeded
    [Report from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The number of peace signatures in North China provinces and cities and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has reached 38,839,618, exceeding the goal of 35 million peace signatures in the region called for by the China Peace Committee. The number of peace signatures in Beijing has reached 1,842,512, accounting for 90 percent of the city's population. Tianjin has 1,700,317 signatures, accounting for 86 percent of the city's population. The number of peace signatures in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region accounts for 52 percent of the region's population, with 1,236,062 signatures.
    When launching the peace signature campaign, various localities and major sub-committees carried out extensive publicity and education campaigns. Hebei Province alone printed about 2 million copies of about 30 kinds of propaganda materials. Zhangjiakou City organized more than 600 activists to carry out publicity. The activists who emerged in the peace signature publicity campaign not only collected many signatures but have also become good propagandists. Wu Zhen and Chen Yunxian, two housewives in Tianjin, collected 10,272 signatures in two weeks. Ge Yao, a primary school principal in Gui Sui City, collected 4,000 signatures himself and mobilized teachers and students in the school to go to the countryside to promote the campaign, mobilizing more than 16,000 people to sign in a week. The 400,000 members of the Communist Youth League in Hebei Province not only gloriously completed the task of mobilizing five people to sign per member, but most have also become good propagandists among the masses. Leading cadres in many places personally led the signature campaign. The county magistrate of Xingtai County, Hebei Province, and members of the county committee of the Communist Party personally explained the significance of the peace signature campaign to people's representatives and primary school teachers, and collected more than 120,000 signatures in 40 days, exceeding half of the county's population.
