　　Opinions on Solving the Soybean Seed Problem in Northern Anhui in 1951
    Wang Jingcao
    This manuscript addresses the serious issue of soybean seed supply for the coming year, due to the floods and other factors that have impacted the soybean harvest in Northern Anhui this year. It also offers timely and appropriate solutions. We believe this will serve as a useful reference for the region in addressing this problem.

    Soybean is one of the important agricultural products of Northern Anhui, and it is also a common economic crop cultivated by farmers. Especially in the areas along the Huai River and in the northern part of Anhui, almost all wheat fields are planted with soybeans after the wheat season. Besides being used as food and raw materials for local sideline industries, these soybeans are also a major export product of Northern Anhui. According to the statistics of Bengbu, a grain distribution market in Northern Anhui, in October of last year, soybean transactions reached 103,214 packages, accounting for 47.7 percent of the total grain transactions. The soybeans in Northern Anhui have smooth, uniform, and dry grains, and the oil yield per dan (approximately 50 kg) is about 11 jin (approximately 5.5 kg), with excellent quality. They have a good reputation in the Shanghai and Wuxi markets, and their future development is promising.

    However, due to this year's floods in Northern Anhui, soybean production has suffered great losses. Therefore, the supply of seeds for soybean production next year has become a highly important issue. As is well known, soybean is a crop with minimal adaptability. Therefore, the seeds needed for next year should definitely not be purchased from outside, but should be solved locally. But can the soybean seeds for next year in Northern Anhui be solved locally?

    Looking at the situation in Huainan, the most densely cultivated area for soybeans is along the Huai River, which was completely flooded this year. The few remaining soybean areas that were not flooded can supply seeds to the disaster areas of Huainan. According to reports, in the area north of the Huai River, the flooded farmland in Northern Anhui this year accounts for 85 percent of the cultivated area. In the Suxian Special District, the flooded farmland accounts for 78 percent of the cultivated area. It is now estimated that the soybean cultivation area in the Fuyang Special District is 7,500,000 mu (approximately 1,235,527 acres), and the soybean cultivation area in the Suxian Special District is 4,000,000 mu (approximately 658,948 acres), totaling 11,500,000 mu (approximately 1,894,475 acres). Of this, 9,495,000 mu (approximately 1,566,118 acres) were flooded, leaving 2,005,000 mu (approximately 328,357 acres). However, the remaining soybeans were affected by the drought in June, which delayed the soybean sowing time, the continuous rain in July, which resulted in poor soybean growth, and the severe drought in August and September, which resulted in few soybean pods and fewer grains per pod. Therefore, the average yield of soybeans per mu this year will generally not exceed 50 jin (approximately 25 kg). The total soybean production in the entire Northern Anhui region this year will not exceed 1,002,500 dan (approximately 50,125,000 kg). If all of this is retained as seeds for next year, it can only be sown on 10,025,000 mu (approximately 1,651,244 acres), which is still less than this year's soybean cultivation area. In fact, it is impossible for all soybeans in Northern Anhui to be retained as seeds for next year, because Northern Anhui is a disaster area, some soybeans will be eaten, some soybeans will be used for sideline production, and some soybeans will inevitably be purchased by grain merchants in Shanghai and Wuxi. By the time of the soybean sowing season next year, it will be difficult for the rural areas to retain even 20 percent of the soybeans as seeds. This shows that if appropriate measures are not taken in advance regarding seed supply, the soybean cultivation area in Northern Anhui next year may be sharply reduced from 11,500,000 mu (approximately 1,894,475 acres) to 2,000,000 mu (approximately 329,474 acres), which is a very noteworthy issue.

    What needs to be considered even more is the Northeast soybeans that are shipped to Northern Anhui. In order to support the disaster-stricken people of Northern Anhui in successfully overcoming the disaster, the Northeast People's Government initially allocated 70 million jin (approximately 35 million kg) of soybeans to Northern Anhui for oil extraction. Recently, it was reported that the Suxian Special District is preparing to receive another 120 million jin (approximately 60 million kg) of Northeast grain (which will inevitably include a lot of soybeans). Northeast soybeans have plump grains and high oil content. When soybean seeds are in extremely short supply next summer, farmers in disaster areas are likely to use a large amount of Northeast soybeans as seeds. However, according to the results of experiments at Nanjing Jinling University, Northeast soybeans die without flowering when cultivated in Nanjing. The results of experiments at the former Anhui Provincial Cotton and Silkworm Improvement Farm showed that Beijing soybeans only flower but do not produce pods when cultivated in Anqing. Although Northeast soybeans have never been cultivated in Northern Anhui, it can be inferred based on the sunshine and climate of the two places that Northeast soybeans will not grow and bear fruit in Northern Anhui. Therefore, we must be vigilant and pay attention to this in advance.

    How do we solve the soybean seed problem in Northern Anhui next year?

    First of all, we must strictly monitor the management of the Northeast soybeans transported to the Huai River area, ensuring that they are all used for sideline production. We must also widely publicize that Northeast soybeans do not grow well in Northern Anhui and do not produce grains, and farmers must not plant them. We must persuade farmers in various places not to use Northeast soybeans as seeds next year.

    Secondly, we must control the existing soybeans in Northern Anhui and save as much as possible to reduce the difficulties in the soybean seed problem next year.

    ① In disaster areas, many people engage in sideline industries such as oil extraction and tofu making, which require soybeans as raw materials. Local leaders can plan early to distribute Northeast soybeans to those engaged in sideline businesses in various places so that they can immediately start sideline production during the slack season after wheat planting, and avoid consuming local soybeans, which would affect next year's seeds.

    ② Grain companies, trade companies, and the People's Bank of China should purchase large quantities of soybeans after the harvest, store them properly, and reserve them for sale or loan to farmers as seeds next summer. When purchasing, the price of soybeans can be appropriately increased to prevent soybean exports and achieve the goal of local preservation.

    ③ During the autumn tax collection in non-disaster areas, more soybeans and less sorghum should be collected. When allocating grain, avoid allocating soybeans as much as possible so that the government can control more local soybeans in preparation for next year's seeds.

    ④ Grain companies, trade companies, the People's Bank of China, and grain warehouses in various places should pay special attention to the storage of soybeans, improve storage technology, and preserve the germination ability of soybeans.

    ⑤ Widely explain that soybean seeds from other places cannot be used, that local harvests have been poor this year, and that soybean seeds will definitely be particularly expensive next year. Advise farmers to save more soybean seeds to avoid being unable to afford them next year, and promote mutual assistance, encouraging relatives and neighbors to help each other. Farmers who have not harvested soybeans this year should pre-borrow soybean seeds from relatives and neighbors who have harvested more soybeans.

　　对于解决一九五一年皖北大豆种籽的意见
    王劲草
    这篇稿子，就皖北今年水灾及其他原因因而影响大豆歉收的情况，指出明年大豆种籽供应问题的严重性，并提出及时加以适当处理的意见。我们认为可供该地在处理这个问题上的参考。
          ——编者
    大豆，是皖北的重要农产之一，也是农家栽培较普遍的经济作物，尤其在淮河沿岸及淮北一带，几乎全部麦田在麦季以后都种植大豆。这些大豆，除了作食粮和本地副业原料外，更是皖北主要的外销物产。根据皖北粮食集散市场蚌埠在去年十月份的统计，该月内大豆成交一○三、二一四包，占全部粮食成交数量的百分之四七·七。皖北大豆籽粒圆滑、匀整、干燥，每担出油量达十一斤左右，品质特优，在上海、无锡市场，很有信誉，前途的发展，也很有希望。
    但由于今年皖北的水灾，使大豆生产遭受了很大损失，因此明年的大豆生产，在种籽的供应上，就成为一个极堪重视的问题。如所周知，大豆是一种适应性最小的作物，所以明年所需的种籽，决不宜向外采购，而只能就地解决，但明年的皖北大豆种籽，能不能就地解决呢？
    以淮南情况看，栽培大豆最密集的地区是沿淮一带，今年全部被淹坏了。而其他少数未淹地区的大豆，可以供应淮南水灾区的种籽。而淮河以北，据报载，皖北今年被淹田亩占耕地面积百分之八十五，宿县专区被淹田亩占耕地面积百分之七十八，现在估计阜阳专区大豆栽培面积是七、五○○、○○○亩，宿县专区大豆栽培面积是四、○○○、○○○亩，合计一一、五○○、○○○亩，除淹坏了九、四九五、○○○亩，尚有二、○○五、○○○亩。但这尚存的大豆，由于六月份干旱，影响大豆播种失时，七月份霪雨，大豆生长不良，八九月份亢旱，大豆结荚不多，每荚中的豆粒又少，因此今年每亩大豆的平均产量，一般不会超过五十斤。全淮北区今年大豆的总产量，不会超过一、○○二、五○○担，全部留作明年的种籽，也只能播种一○、○二五、○○○亩，还赶不上今年大豆的栽培面积。而事实上淮北大豆也不可能全部留作明年的种籽，因为淮北是灾区，一部分大豆将被吃掉，一部分大豆将被投入副业生产，也不免有一部分大豆为上海、无锡粮商所采购。到明年大豆播种季节，农村中能保留十分之二的大豆作种籽，已算难得。这说明了在种籽供应上如不预作适当处理，明年淮北的大豆栽培面积，是可能由一一、五○○、○○○亩，锐减为二、○○○、○○○亩，这是很值得注意的一个问题。
    更须考虑的是运到皖北来的东北大豆。为了支援皖北灾民胜利的度过灾荒，东北人民政府首次拨了七千万斤大豆交皖北榨油，最近报载宿县专区又准备接运一亿二千万斤东北粮（内中自将有不少的大豆）。东北大豆籽粒饱满，含油量高，在明夏豆种奇缺时，灾区农民很可能将东北大豆大量用作种籽。但据南京金陵大学试验的结果，在南京栽培东北大豆，不开花就死了。前安徽省棉蚕改良场试验的结果，北京大豆在安庆栽培，只开花不结荚子。虽说东北大豆不曾在皖北栽培过，但依照两地的日照和气候，也可推知东北的大豆，在淮北将不能生长结实，因此我们必须预为警惕和重视。
    怎样解决皖北明年的豆种问题呢？
    首先，我们要严密的注意运淮东北大豆的管理，使它全部投入副业生产，并广泛宣传，说明东北大豆在皖北长不好，不结粒，千万种不得，说服各地农民明年不用东北大豆作种籽。
    其次，我们要控制现有的皖北大豆，尽多地保存下来，使明年的豆种问题减少困难。
    ①灾区中搞副业，普通多是榨油、做豆腐，都需用大豆作原料，当地领导上可及早有计划的把东北大豆分配给各地经营副业者，以便种麦后农闲时立即开始副业生产，且不消耗本地豆子而影响明年豆种。
    ②粮食公司、贸易公司、人民银行，在大豆收获后，应大量收购，妥善储存，留待明夏出售或贷给农民作种籽。收购时可把大豆价格，酌量提高，以预防大豆出口，达到就地保存的目的。
    ③非灾区秋征时，应多征大豆，少征高粱，拨粮的时候，应尽量避免交拨大豆，俾政府可以控制较多的本地大豆，准备明年作种籽。
    ④粮食公司、贸易公司、人民银行，以及各地粮食仓库，对大豆保管，应特别注意，提高仓储技术，保存大豆的发芽力。
    ⑤广泛说明外地大豆种籽不能用，今年本地歉收，明年豆种必定特别贵，劝导农民要多保留豆种，免得明年买不起，并提倡以有济无，实行亲帮亲，邻帮邻，今年没收获大豆的农民，向收大豆较多的亲邻预借豆种。
