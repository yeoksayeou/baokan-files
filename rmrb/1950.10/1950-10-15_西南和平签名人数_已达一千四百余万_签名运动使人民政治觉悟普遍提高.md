Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 14th: The people of Southwest China are continuing to展开[zhǎn kāi, launch] the peace signature campaign. As of October 8th, the total number of signatures in the region reached 14,456,375, accounting for 21 percent of the region's population. The breakdown is as follows: Eastern Sichuan Administrative Region: 4,026,184 people; Southern Sichuan Administrative Region: 2,300,000 people; Western Sichuan Administrative Region: 3,663,129 people; Northern Sichuan Administrative Region: 1,620,000 people; Yunnan Province: 1,114,000 people; Guizhou Province: 651,925 people; Xikang Province: 141,000 people; Chongqing City: 1,047,237 people. Among them, the number of peace signatures in Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang and other cities has accounted for more than 80 percent of the city's population, and the number of signatures in Chengdu has exceeded 90 percent of the city's population.

In the peace signature campaign, various propaganda activities have been carried out in various parts of the Southwest China. For example, the First District of Chongqing has successively held hundreds of mass meetings and small forums, conducted street speeches, posted slogans and cartoons, thus launching a upsurge of people from all walks of life to participate in peace signatures. The bandit suppression troops brought the propaganda of defending peace to the vast rural areas, and a certain army stationed in the Southern Sichuan Administrative Region alone collected 45,000 signatures. Local newspapers have become powerful propagandists and organizers of peace signatures. The Western Sichuan Daily has successively received six batches of signatures, totaling 1,804,268 people. More than 10,000 students from summer schools in various parts of Southwest China participated in the propaganda of defending peace. The responsible persons of the democratic parties made propaganda speeches at the mass meetings of peace signatures. The post office and the salt bureau put the slogans of defending peace on letters and salt bags. Chengdu City has also launched a campaign to write a letter of condolence to the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Korean People's Army for each person in conjunction with the anti-American aggression against Taiwan and North Korea movement. As of the end of September, the city has received more than 40,000 such letters.

The peace signature campaign has greatly raised the political awareness of the broad masses of the people. Zhang Shuwan, a member of the Democratic Women's Federation of Sanjing Township, Fushun County, Southern Sichuan, actively participated in the work of defending peace. She handed over her three children to her neighbors to take care of them every day, and went out to promote and collect signatures. She said: "It is not that I don't love children, defending peace is precisely for the children to have a peaceful and happy life in the future." Many people have realized that the Soviet Union is a bulwark for defending world peace in the peace signature campaign, and have joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association one after another. For example, the Chengdu Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has developed 34 branches in the peace signature campaign, and the number of members has increased to 5,437.

　　西南和平签名人数
    已达一千四百余万
    签名运动使人民政治觉悟普遍提高
    【新华社重庆十四日电】西南人民正在继续展开和平签名运动。截至十月八日止，该区全区签名人数已达一千四百五十六万三千四百七十五人，占全区人口百分之二十一。计：川东行政区四百零二万六千一百八十四人，川南行政区二百三十万人，川西行政区三百六十六万三千一百二十九人，川北行政区一百六十二万人，云南省一百一十一万四千人，贵州省六十五万一千九百二十五人，西康省十四万一千人，重庆市一百零四万七千二百三十七人。其中重庆、昆明、贵阳等市的和平签名人数均已占全市人口百分之八十以上，成都市的签名人数超过了全市人口百分之九十。
    西南区各地在和平签名运动中，都展开了各种宣传运动。如重庆市第一区曾连续召开群众大会、小型座谈会数百次，进行街头演讲，张贴标语和漫画，因而发动了各界人民参加和平签名的热潮。剿匪部队将保卫和平的宣传带到广大农村，仅驻川南区某军即征集了四万五千人签名。各地报纸成为和平签名有力的宣传者与组织者。川西日报先后收到六批签名共达一百八十万四千二百六十八人。西南各地暑期学园有一万以上的学生参加了保卫和平的宣传。各民主党派的负责人在和平签名的群众大会上进行宣传讲演。邮政局和盐务局把保卫和平的标语贴在信件上和盐包上。成都市并曾结合反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动，发起每人向中国人民解放军和朝鲜人民军写一封慰问信的运动，截至九月下旬止，该市已收到此类信件四万多封。
    和平签名运动使广大人民的政治觉悟大为提高。川南富顺县三井乡民主妇女联合会会员张淑万积极参加保卫和平的工作。她每天把三个孩子交给邻家照顾，自己出去宣传并征集签名。她说：“我不是不爱孩子，保卫和平正是为了孩子们将来能有和平的幸福生活的日子。”许多人在和平签名运动中认识到苏联是保卫世界和平的堡垒，纷纷加入中苏友好协会。例如成都市的中苏友好协会在和平签名运动中即发展了三十四个支会，会员增加到五千四百三十七人。
