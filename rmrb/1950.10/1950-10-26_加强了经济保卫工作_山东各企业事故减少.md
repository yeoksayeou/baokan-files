　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 24th: Shandong Province's state-owned enterprises have significantly reduced sabotage accidents due to strengthened economic security work. The average number of accidents occurring in the four months from May to August was 60% lower than in April.

　　Since the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government convened the National Economic Security Work Conference in May of this year, public security organs at all levels in Shandong Province have conveyed and discussed the spirit and decisions of the conference, clearly defining the direction and tasks of economic security work, and formulating specific implementation measures. Over the past four months, specialized economic security organizations have been established in major enterprise units to strengthen investigation and research, carry out registration of reactionary party and league members, and destroy counter-revolutionary organizations hidden within enterprises waiting for opportunities to carry out sabotage activities. For example, the Qingdao China Textile Company No. 5 Factory cracked the Kuomintang "Youth Iron-Blood Anti-Communist Headquarters" spy organization, avoiding destruction and loss of state property. At the same time, mass security organizations such as safety committees and safety groups have been widely established in various enterprise units to promote and supervise the implementation of the safety responsibility system.

　　加强了经济保卫工作
    山东各企业事故减少
    【新华社济南二十四日电】山东省各国营企业，由于加强了经济保卫工作，破坏事故已显著减少。自五月至八月四个月中发生的事故，平均比四月份减少了百分之六十。
    自今年五月中央人民政府公安部召开全国经济保卫工作会议以后，山东省各级公安机关即根据会议的精神和决定进行了传达和讨论，明确地确定了经济保卫工作的方针和任务，并定出了具体的执行办法。四个月来在各较大的企业单位都建立了专门的经济保卫机构，加强了调查研究，进行了反动党团员的登记工作，并且破坏了隐藏在企业内部，待机进行破坏活动的反革命组织。如青岛中国纺织公司第五厂破获了匪“青年铁血反共司令部”的特务组织等，避免了国家财产的破坏和损失。同时，各企业单位还普遍建立了群众性的保卫组织，如安全委员会、安全小组等推动与监督安全责任制度的执行。
