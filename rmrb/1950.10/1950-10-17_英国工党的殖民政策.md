The British Labour Party's Colonial Policy
    Wei Niekrasov
    Readers of the *News*, Comrade I. I. Moskalev (Sheng Luz District, Moscow) and Comrade M. A. Us (Ush Tobe Station, Kachakh Republic) requested an explanation of the colonial policies of the British Labour Party government. This article is the answer written by Comrade Wei Niekrasov.
    After the Second World War, which marked the upsurge of the national liberation struggle of the dependent countries, the entire colonial system of British imperialism faced the fate of bankruptcy. The struggles of the various ethnic groups in India and Malaya, Burma and British African colonies dealt a devastating blow to British imperialism, which, as Lenin pointed out, was mainly based on the cruel exploitation of the various regions and colonies belonging to the empire. After the Labour Party and its leaders, these capable lackeys of British capitalists, came to power, they used and are now using all their strength to keep this set of institutions that cruelly exploit the colonial peoples from destruction, because this institution can guarantee the profits of British monopoly capital.
    There is nothing new in the Labour Party's policy. As early as thirty years ago, a Labour Party leader named Philip Snowden openly declared that Labour Party members would implement the same colonial policies as the Conservatives, and would act in this matter in the same way as "any British government in the past."
    However, the unprecedented large-scale national liberation movement in the entire colonial world, which arose after the collapse of the German, Italian, and Japanese imperialist systems, forced the current Labour Party leaders to slightly change their strategy. They once declared that the Labour Party was supposedly against imperialist oppression of colonial peoples. On October 14, 1948, Bevin announced at a breakfast meeting hosted by the National Industrialists Alliance: "We no longer belong to the imperialist lineage, and we do not rule anyone now. We agree on equality in terms of religion, skin color, and relationship to the legal system, and in the areas that we still rule, we are working to ensure their independence and autonomy."
    In this way, the Labour Party leaders created a completely hypocritical theory of "colonial liberation" in terms of colonial policy, which is no less hypocritical than their theory of "democratic socialism" in domestic affairs.
    In order to prove the "sincerity" of their various propaganda statements, the Labour Party leaders used the excuse that they had replaced the name of the British Empire with a more "suitable" name, the "British Commonwealth of Nations"; and that they had granted "independence" to Burma, and made India, Pakistan, and Ceylon into dominions.
    But the facts undeniably prove that what replaced the Conservatives' colonial policy was the Labour Party's colonial exploitation policy. As early as 1925, Comrade Stalin said of the colonial policy of the Conservative Party that it was "a force that inevitably and inevitably leads Britain to destruction"; and the colonial policy of the Labour Party is no different in essence from the various traditional goals and methods of the Conservatives. The British Labour Party leaders, who accepted the completely clear task from the British masters of preserving the colonial empire for the sake of various British monopolies, their true role is not to liberate the colonial peoples, but to apply a whole set of new and more refined methods of ruling the colonies.
    In 1947, India was divided into two "equal rights" countries—the Dominions of India and Pakistan, which joined the "British Commonwealth". In January 1948, the "independence" of Burma was announced; in February of the same year, the island of Ceylon also became a dominion. In January 1950, the Dominion of India was declared a republic, with an elected president as the head of state. However, this republic still remained a member of the British Empire and recognized the British Emperor's power over it.
    Do these formal changes bring about any real changes in the situation of the colonial countries? Not at all. It is becoming increasingly clear that the purpose of these changes is purely to consolidate the old imperialist rule over the colonies by various new methods under new conditions.
    No matter what kind of measures the Labour Party government takes in the colonies, the result is always that the big capitalists benefit, and the burden of the working masses cannot be alleviated at all.
    In all the British colonies that are now called "independent," the dominant position of British capital remains intact. British shops are the de facto masters of the colonial economy. Nominally independent Burma is still under the control of five British companies, which separately operate Burma's natural resources, transportation, trade, and finance. British monopoly groups such as "Andrew Yule & Co.", "Hillanders Arbuthnot," "Octavius Steel," and others occupy a dominant position in the Indian economy. British monopoly capital can still influence these countries' foreign trade and finance because they have joined the Sterling Area and their (especially India's) accounts are safely hidden in British banks.
    Recently, British capitalists have agreed to give the national bourgeoisie of the colonies some large "freedom of action," that is, "freedom" to exploit the broad masses. Of course, the British colonizers will not lose anything because of such a "federal union of friends." As a result, the exploitation of the colonial working masses has been further intensified.
    In particular, it can be seen that the profits currently obtained by British companies in the colonies are higher than before the war. The United Africa Company made a profit of £25 million in 1948. The British Tin Company tripled its profits from 1946 to 1948. Sixty-one rubber companies in Malaya made a profit of approximately £250 million last year.
    It is precisely in order to preserve these excess profits that British imperialism has been waging war in Malaya for the past two years. There are 100,000 troops equipped with modern artillery, tanks, and aircraft operating here. A reign of terror was established locally. The British colonial authorities in Malaya have issued 25,000 arrest warrants from June 1948 to the present, and approximately 11,000 people have been imprisoned.
    The Labour Party government is also equally ruthlessly sanctioning the actions of workers in other colonies. The bloody events that occurred in the African colony of Nigeria are known all over the world: in November 1949, the British authorities shot and killed more than 100 miners who demanded higher wages.
    Has the Labour Party government abandoned the old imperialist "divide and rule" "motto" in its own policies? Has it stopped using the habitual trick of instigating colonial peoples to fight each other in order to weaken the anti-imperialist united front? No, it hasn't. The skillful incitement of religious friction between Indians and Muslims continues to be an important tool in British policy in India and Pakistan. Using this means, the Labour Party government skillfully preserved its sovereignty over India in 1947, and quietly replaced the independence that should have been granted to India by dividing India into two dominions. British imperialism, by inciting hatred between India and Pakistan, has virtually interrupted trade between India and Pakistan. This is beneficial to British monopolists who are trying to seize the Pakistani market. Due to these treacherous schemes of the British, the dispute between India and Pakistan regarding the issue of the Kashmir principality has not yet been resolved. At the same time, there are plans to incite Pakistan and Afghanistan to engage in military conflict.
    In this way, the Labour Party's "new policy" towards the colonies is—after all—the old method of plundering the colonies. The colonial peoples still live in terrible and harsh conditions as before. The situation of the workers in the British African colonies is particularly difficult. For example, in the Union of South Africa, blacks and Indians among the local residents have been driven off the land. And the most barren, semi-desert land—the so-called reserves—is allocated to them. Blacks generally have to obtain a special permit to come to the city to find work, and this permit only allows them to live in specially designated areas, that is, "designated zones." After a certain time, blacks are not allowed to come to the streets. If blacks work in some mining enterprise, they live in barracks surrounded by wire mesh, the so-called "compounds."
    And the facts have completely negated the Labour Party people's hard saying that they are "concerned" about the culture of the colonial peoples. For example, in Nigeria, out of eight million school-age children, 7.5 million do not have the opportunity to go to school. Although there are 30 million residents in the country, there are only six middle schools and one hundred hospital beds!
    In addition, according to British official data, a lot of money has been spent in recent years for the needs of "developing" the colonies. According to the law on "Development of Colonial Welfare," £120 million should be spent on "non-commercial" purposes in ten years. But are these funds used to build schools, hospitals, and research institutes in the colonies? Are they used to improve the material living conditions of the workers? Absolutely not! As long as you take a careful look, you can see that these funds are first used for military strategic construction, and secondly, they are used to increase the export of raw materials that can be sold for US dollars from the colonies. In 1948 alone, the British government received 150 million pounds in income from the colonies as a reserve of US dollars, which exceeded the planned expenditure for "developing" the colonies in ten years by 30 million pounds.
    In order to further strengthen the exploitation of the colonies, the Labour Party government created some "social organizations," such as the Colonial Development Corporation, the Colonial Food Resources Development Corporation, the Cameroon Mining Corporation, etc. These organizations are presided over by representatives of monopoly capital who greedily protect their own interests. For example, the Colonial Development Corporation recently loaned £250,000 to the British Guiana Consolidated Gold Mining Company to "explore and expand production." Various iron ore companies in Malaya have also received £4.4 million in loans and subsidies from the British Colonial Department and the Supply Department.
    Under the guise of inflammatory propaganda about their "achievements" in the colonies, the Labour Party government is frantically preparing military bases there. The secret plan of the Imperial General Staff to create a "great strategic triangle" in the Indian Ocean region is enough to prove this. According to this plan, British Africa, Pakistan, India, Malaya, Australia, and the Near East should all become military fortresses of the British Empire, its armories, and sources of manpower. Some news revealed in the newspapers proved that this plan of the British General Staff is being gradually realized, and military bases, airports, strategically needed roads, and various military enterprises are being built.
    The Labour Party government is brewing plans to conclude a number of military pacts, in which the various regions belonging to the British Empire are participating. Here are the plans for the South Atlantic Alliance, the Near East and Pacific Treaty, the "Islamic State," etc. The numerous diplomatic and departmental meetings held in Delhi, Colombo, Sydney, and Singapore not long ago were used to formulate these plans.
    British monopoly capital, which is trying to maintain its source of profits, is asking American imperialists for "assistance," which in essence is nothing more than suggesting to them to jointly exploit the British Empire. The government of Attlee and Bevin obediently agreed to the American imperialist's colonial expansion program embodied in the so-called "Truman Program."
    After expressing their protest against the Labour Party's imperialist policy, the popular masses of the colonial countries have united more closely to fight against Anglo-American imperialism. In Malaya, the flames of the liberation war are burning fiercely. The Burmese people, who are resisting the British colonizers and the faction of traitors to national interests in the camp of local rulers, are also fighting for their freedom. The African "black continent" has also risen to fight.
    The various ethnic groups in the colonies are resisting the criminal plans that are preparing for a new war and are actively participating in the collection of millions of signatures for the Stockholm Peace Declaration on the prohibition of atomic weapons. In Burma, in India, in Nigeria, in Pakistan and Nepal, on the island of Ceylon and on the island of Cyprus—the colonial workers are responding to peace, opposing imperialism, which cannot survive without the plundering of the colonies, and opposing the Labour Party lackeys of imperialism.

### 英国工党的殖民政策

专栏：苏联消息报答读者问

　　英国工党的殖民政策
    维·涅克拉索夫
    消息报的读者伊·伊·莫斯卡列夫同志（莫斯科胜鲁兹区）和姆·阿·乌斯同志（卡查赫共和国·乌施·托贝站）请求说明一下英国工党政府的殖民地政策。这篇文章便是由维·涅克拉索夫同志执笔的答案。
    在标志着附庸国家民族的族解放斗争高涨的第二次世界大战以后，英国帝国主义的全部殖民地体系便已面临着破产的命运。印度与马来亚、缅甸与英属非洲殖民地各民族的斗争给予英国帝国主义以毁灭性的打击；这一帝国主义，正如列宁所指出的，主要地是奠基在对帝国所属各地与殖民地的残酷剥削上面的。在英国大资本家们的这些干练的走狗——工党和它的领导者们——当权以后，就用了并且现在也在用着全力来保持这一套对殖民地各民族加以最残酷剥削的机构，使其免于毁灭，因为这一机构是可以保证英国垄断资本的利润的。
    在工党的这一政策里是没有什么新花样的。早在三十多年前，当时一个叫做菲利浦·斯诺敦的工党领袖就公开宣称，工党党员们将要施行和保守党人们同样的殖民地政策，并且在这个问题上，将要“和过去任何一个英国政府”同样地行动。
    但是全部殖民地世界中，继德国、意大利与日本帝国主义体系底的溃而起的空前大规模的民族解放运动，迫使现在的工党领袖们略略改变了自己的战略。曾经宣称：工党仿佛是反对帝国主义对殖民地各民族压迫的。一九四八年十月十四日贝文在民族工业家联盟招待他的早餐会上曾宣布说：“我们已不再属于帝国主义的血统了，我们现在不统治着任何人。我们同意在宗教、肤色方面和对于法制关系上的平等，并且在现在还由我们统治着的地区里，我们正努力于保证其独立与自治”。
    这样，工党领袖们在殖民地政策方面，便创造出一种彻头彻尾虚伪的“殖民地解放”的理论，它和它在内政方面的“民主社会主义”的虚伪理论正是不相上下的。
    为了要证明自己各次宣传性声明的“诚意”，工党领袖们借口说他们已把不列颠帝国（The British Empire)的名称用一较“合适的”“不列颠联邦”（British Cmmonwealth of Nations）的名称来代替了；又说他们已经把“独立”给予了缅甸，并且使印度、巴基斯坦、锡兰成为自治领。
    但事实却无可争辩地证明了：代替保守党的殖民地政策而来的是工党的殖民地剥削政策。关于保守党的殖民地政策，斯大林同志早在一九二五年就说过，这是“一种必然、而不可避免地把英国引向灭亡的力量”；而工党的殖民地政策，在本质上，和保守党人们的各种传统的目的与方法是并没有什么不同的。从英国的主子那里接受了为英国各种垄断事业而保全殖民地帝国的这一完全明确的任务的英国工党领导者们，他们真正的作用，并不是在于解放殖民地各民族，而是在于要把统治殖民地的整套新的、更精炼的方法应用出来。
    一九四七年印度被分为两个“权利平等的”国家——加入在“不列颠联邦”里面的印度与巴基斯坦自治领。一九四八年一月宣布了缅甸的“独立”；同年二月锡兰岛也成了自治领。一九五○年一月印度自治领又被宣布为共和国，而以选出的总统为元首。可是这一共和国仍旧留在不列颠帝国的成员里，并且承认英皇对自己的权力。
    这些形式上的改变，使殖民地国家的情况发生了什么真正的变革么？一点儿也没有的。越来越清楚地见到：这些改变的目的纯乎是在新的条件下，用各种新的方法来巩固帝国主义旧的对殖民地的统治罢了。
    不拘工党政府在各殖民地采取什么样儿的措施，其结果总还是使那些大财阀们得利，而劳动大众的负担是丝毫也不能减轻的。
    在所有现在被称为“独立”的英国殖民地中，英国资本的统治地位仍旧是完整无损的。英国的商店在殖民地的经济上是实际的主人。名义上独立的缅甸，直到今天为止还处在五家英国公司的支配之下，由它们分别经营着缅甸的自然资源、运输工具、贸易与财政。英国的各垄断集团如“安德留·犹尔公司”、“希兰德斯·阿尔倍特诺”、“屋大维·斯蒂尔”及其他等等在印度经济中占着左右大局的地位。英国的垄断资本仍旧可以影响这些国家的对外贸易和财政，因为它们加入了英镑集团，而它们（特别是印度）的账目又被妥藏在英国的银行里。
    近来英国的资本家们同意给予各殖民地的民族资产阶级以一些大的“行动自由”，即剥削广大群众的“自由”。当然，英国的殖民者因为有这样的一个“友谊的联邦”是什么也不会失掉的。其结果，对于殖民地劳动大众的剥削却更形加强了。
    特别可以看出，英国各公司目前在殖民地所得到的利润是比较战前更高的。联合非洲公司在一九四八年获利二千五百万镑。英国锡业公司从一九四六年到一九四八年获到了三倍的利润。马来亚的六十一个橡胶公司在去年就获得了大约有二亿五千万镑的利润。
    正是为了要保全这些超额的利润，英国帝国主义最近两年来才在马来亚进行着战争。在这里活动着的有十万名配备着现代的大炮、坦克与飞机的军队。在当地树立了恐怖的统治。马来亚英国殖民当局从一九四八年六月到现在，发布了两万五千次的逮捕令，约有一万一千人被囚禁在监狱里。
    对于其他各殖民地劳动者们的行动，工党政府也是同样残酷地加以制裁。全世界都知道在非洲殖民地尼日利亚地方所发生的血腥事件：一九四九年十一月英国当局曾在那里毙伤了一百多名要求提高工资的矿工。
    工党政府在其自身的政策中是否已放弃了旧的帝国主义“分而治之”的“座右铭”呢？是否已不再使用那为达成其削弱反帝统一战线之目的而嗾使殖民地各民族相互倾轧的惯技呢？不，并没有的。对于印回两教宗教上的轧砾加以巧妙的煽动，依然继续是英国在印度与巴基斯坦所用的政策上一个重要的工具。利用这一手段，工党政府在一九四七年巧妙地保存了自己对印度的主权，并且以把印度分裂为两个自治领的方法悄悄地代替了应该给予印度的独立。英国帝国主义以煽动印度与巴基斯坦之间的仇恨的方法，使印度与巴基斯坦之间的贸易实际上是中断了。这对于那力图掌握巴基斯坦市场的英国垄断者是有利的。由于英国的这些奸策，到现在印度与巴基斯坦在有关喀什米尔公国的问题上的争议仍未获得调整。同时又在计划着煽动巴基斯坦和阿富汗，使他们发生军事上的冲突。
    这样，工党对各殖民地的“新政策”——终于还是那一套对殖民地加以掠夺的老方法。殖民地各族人民还是和从前一样地生活在可怕的恶劣条件下。英属非洲各殖民地的劳动者们的情况更是特别困苦。例如，在南非联邦，地方的居民中黑人和印度人都由土地上被驱走了。而把那最硗瘠的、半沙漠的土地——即所谓特居地分配给他们。黑人到城市来找工作一般是必须要得到一特别的许可，这许可只允许他们在特别规定的地区，即“特定区”内住宿。在一定的时刻以后，黑人便不能到街上来了。如果黑人在什么矿山企业内工作的话，他们就住在用铁丝网圈起来的，所谓“围地”的营房里。
    而事实已彻底否定了工党的人们所硬说的、仿佛他们是“关心”殖民地各民族的文化的话。举例来说，在尼日利亚，八百万的学龄儿童中间，有七百五十万是没有机会上学的。国内居民虽然有三千万人，但是只有六所中学校和一百张病床！
    此外，根据英国官方的资料来看，近年来为了“发展”各殖民地的需要，曾支出了不少的金钱。根据有关“发展殖民地福利”的法律，在十年之间，用于“非商业的”目的的金钱应该支出一亿二千万镑。但这些款项是用来在各殖民地建设学校、病院、研究所么？是用来改善劳动者们物质生活的状况么？决不是的！只要是一细心观察就可以看出，这些款项首先就是用在军事战略上的建设上面，而其次是用来增加各殖民地的那些种植可以售得美元的原料的出口量。只在一九四八年一年当中，英国政府就从各殖民地得到一亿五千万镑的收入做为美元的预备金，这笔钱比起计划在十年中间“发展”殖民地所需的支出来超过了有三千万镑。
    为了更加强对各殖民地的剥削，工党政府创设了一些“社会组合”，例如殖民地发展组合，殖民地食粮资源发展组合，喀麦隆矿山组合等等。主持这些组合的是那些贪婪地保护着自己利益的垄断资本的代表者们。例如殖民地发展组合在不久之前曾贷款二十五万镑给英属基阿那统一采金公司用来“勘查并扩展生产”。马来亚各铁矿公司也从英国的殖民部与供应部得到四百四十万镑的贷金和补助金。
    在对自己在各殖民地的“成就”的煽动宣传的掩饰之下，工党政府在那里疯狂地准备军事基地。只是帝国参谋本部关于在印度洋地区创立“伟大战略三角地带”的秘密计划便足以证明这一点。根据这一计划，英属非洲、巴基斯坦、印度、马来亚、澳大利亚和近东各地方就都应该成为不列颠帝国的军事堡垒，成为它的军火库和补充人力的泉源。在报纸上透露的若干消息证明了：英国参谋本部的这一计划正在逐步实现，军事基地、飞机场、战略上所需的道路和各种军事企业都正在建设着。
    工党政府正在酝酿着缔结若干军事公约的计划，在这些计划内是有不列颠帝国所属各地参加在内的。这里就有南大西洋联盟，近东与太平洋公约，“伊斯兰教国”等等的计划。不久以前在德里，哥伦坡，悉德尼，新加坡所召开的多次外交的与各部的会议，便是用来拟定这些计划的。
    力图保持自己利润之源泉的英国垄断资本向美国帝国主义者们请求“援助”，这在本质上也不过就是向他们建议共同剥削大不列颠帝国而已。艾德礼、贝文的政府顺从地赞同了体现在所谓“杜鲁门纲领”中的美国帝国主义的殖民地扩张纲领。
    殖民地各国的人民群众在表示了自己对工党帝国主义政策的抗议以后，他们便更紧密地团结在一起为反对英美帝国主义而进行斗争。在马来亚，解放战争的火焰正在熊熊地燃烧着。反抗英国殖民者和地方统治者阵营中叛卖民族利益分子的缅甸人民也正在为争取自己的自由而斗争着。非洲的“黑色大陆”也起来斗争了。
    殖民地的各民族都在反抗那些准备新战争的罪恶计划、并且积极地参加了关于禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩和平宣言千百万签名的征集运动。在缅甸、在印度、在尼日利亚、在巴基斯坦和尼泊尔、在锡兰岛和塞浦路斯岛——殖民地的劳动者们都响应和平、反对那不靠对殖民地的劫掠就不能生存的帝国主义，并且反对帝国主义的那些工党走狗。
