　　Lü Shunbao, a Special-Class Combat Hero, Zhang Baoying, a Combat Hero of the First Field Army, and Zhang Hongyi, a model worker of the unit, felt excited and encouraged to be able to celebrate the first National Day of the motherland in the capital.

　　Special-Class Combat Hero Lü Shunbao said: "In the year since the establishment of the Central People's Government, the country's economic construction has made great progress and is moving towards prosperity and happiness. However, at present, American imperialism and its running dogs are carrying out conspiracies to sabotage and savage aggression against our motherland's construction, which is absolutely intolerable. We are the People's Liberation Army, the defenders of the motherland, and we should always strive to prepare to combat American imperialist aggression and defend the motherland's peaceful construction."

　　Zhang Baoying, a Combat Hero of the First Field Army, said: "New China did not come easily. In the past year, our troops have actively participated in economic construction in order to build the motherland more beautifully; however, we are always a fighting force, ready to defend New China!"

　　Zhang Hongyi, a meritorious hero, said: "I am very happy to be able to attend the National Congress of Combat Heroes, especially to be able to participate in the first National Day in the capital, which is a double blessing. This is the glory of my life! New China has been born for a year, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao, it is moving towards happiness, prosperity, and strength, and is vigorously restoring the wounds left to us by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. But the American fascist group is creating war, and American planes have repeatedly violated our country's airspace and brutally harmed our compatriots. We firmly support several statements made by Foreign Minister Zhou. If the American imperialists dare to extend their claws to the Chinese people, we will immediately join the battle to defend the motherland and eliminate the invaders!"

　　我们始终是一支战斗队时刻准备着保卫新中国
    西北军区、一野战斗英雄  吕顺保  张保英  部队模范工作者 张鸿义
    西北战斗英雄代表团的战斗英雄吕顺保、张保英，部队模范工作者张鸿义，为能在首都欢度祖国第一个国庆节，感到兴奋鼓舞。
    特等战斗英雄吕顺保说：“在中央人民政府成立的一年中，国家的经济建设有了很大的发展，而且正走向繁荣幸福的境地。可是，目前美帝国主义和他的走狗们，正对我祖国的建设进行阴谋破坏和野蛮的侵略，这是决不能容忍的。我们是人民解放军，是祖国的保卫者，我们应当随时努力准备打击美帝的侵略，保卫祖国的和平建设事业。”
    一野战斗英雄张保英说：“新中国来的不容易。一年来我们部队积极地参加了经济建设，为的是把祖国建设得更美丽；然而，我们始终还是一支战斗队，随时保卫着新中国！”
    大功功臣张鸿义说：“我能够出席全国战斗英雄代表会议大会，心里就很高兴，特别是赶上在首都参加第一个国庆节，真是喜上加喜，这是我一生的光荣！新中国已诞生一周年了，这一年在毛主席领导下，正朝幸福、繁荣、富强的路上走，正在大力恢复蒋介石匪帮给我们留下的创伤。但美国法西斯集团，却在制造战争，并且美机再三侵犯我国领空，残害我同胞，我们坚决拥护周外长的几次声明，如果美帝胆敢向中国人民伸出魔手，我们会立即投入保卫祖国的战斗，消灭侵略者！”
