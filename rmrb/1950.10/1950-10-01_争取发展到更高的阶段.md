Striving to Develop to a Higher Stage
    Mao Dun

    This year's National Day will feature grand artistic performances in the capital. This is an anniversary review of our cultural troops. Because it is the first review of the first anniversary of the founding of the nation, it particularly attracts people's attention. People will judge from these performances whether the new China's literary and artistic "production" has made any progress.

    It should be affirmed that our literary and artistic work has made progress and achieved results—although it still cannot meet actual needs.

    In the past year, literary and artistic workers, united under the policy of "serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers," have made achievements in popularization work throughout the country. The striving for progress and sincere cooperation of the broad masses of folk artists, and the efforts of artists in the opera circles of large cities to learn and their enthusiasm for performing new plays and songs have played a certain role here and are worthy of praise. Chinese painting artists have also shown the same enthusiastic spirit of refusing to lag behind and serving the people. Efforts to reform old forms and enrich new content can be seen everywhere in the various departments of China's inherent arts.

    The development of the workers' literary and artistic movement has also achieved remarkable results in the past year. Worker writers have also emerged, and their works have reached a fairly high level in terms of content and form. Factory recreational activities have played a significant role in raising class consciousness and encouraging production enthusiasm.

    During the Spring Festival recreational activities, the anti-American aggression movement, the signature campaign to defend peace, and other nationwide movements, literary and artistic workers have been able to respond uniformly to the government's call, undertaking the task of propaganda and education through various literary and artistic forms.

    There are currently twelve national literary and artistic publications and forty-two local (at the level of major administrative regions, provinces, and cities, monthly, weekly, and semi-weekly) publications, all of which have been published successively within the past year. As for literary and artistic creations, the first edition of single-volume books of novels, poems, dramas, popular literature (including ballads, Yangko operas), comic strips, etc., in the past year totaled about 700 kinds. There are no estimated figures for the many newly compiled and adapted Peking operas, local operas, drum lyrics, and a large number of newly created songs, etc., nor are there any estimated figures for art works. In addition, literary and artistic works published in the supplements of various national newspapers have not been counted, probably totaling two to three million words per month.

    It is especially worth mentioning that the comprehensive art of film has made a leap forward in both quality and quantity. Just one thing can illustrate this: in the spring of this year, foreign films that were boring or even toxic still accounted for an average of about 50% of the films shown in major cities across the country, but by the autumn of this year, this had dropped to about 20%. The films produced by our public and private film studios have already gained control of the market.

    All the above-mentioned achievements in literary and artistic work have been achieved entirely by relying on two magic weapons: the correct literary and artistic direction indicated by Chairman Mao and the great unity of literary and artistic circles. The institution responsible for this great unity is the national and local "Federation of Literary and Art Circles," and there are a total of sixty-two local (major administrative regions, provinces, and cities) federations of literary and art circles that have been organized or are in preparation.

    Literary and artistic circles are not satisfied with their achievements in their work; they are often dissatisfied. This is a manifestation of a sense of responsibility, and it is also a manifestation of love for the motherland and for the hardworking and heroic people of the motherland. Dissatisfaction produces distress. If this distress is summarized in one sentence, it is that not only is the distance between subjective strength and objective requirements quite large, but the distance between subjective wishes and objective possible conditions is also not small.

    From the perspective of the literary and artistic movement, everything that should be done has been done, or is being done; however, it always feels insufficient. To use drama as a metaphor: the people on stage are indeed working very hard, doing things according to the rules, and not being lazy at all. After a scene is over, the people off stage also applaud enthusiastically, but they always feel like it's not quite satisfying. In most of the work, it seems that we have plans and steps, and we are always proactive; however, in reality, sometimes plans inevitably remain on paper, or even if they can be realized, we have to avoid being too demanding about the effect; and after being proactive, there are still times when we cannot move, or are passive. We can review things thoroughly, analyze the causes and results correctly, and the corrective measures seem to be not bad; but after a considerable period of time, when we review again, the existing problems are still the same ones as before, that is to say, they have not been completely resolved, or only seem to be resolved on the surface.

    Why does this happen? Some of it is because the distance between subjective strength and objective requirements is quite large, and some of it is because the distance between subjective wishes and objective possible conditions is really not small.

    From the perspective of creative activities, everything that should be reflected and needs to be reflected has been reflected; the amount of reflection is certainly different, but even with the least, we at least have samples. However, even the largest category cannot keep up with objective requirements. This is still in terms of quantity. If we look at quality, then the self-criticism of the literary and artistic circles has always been serious, and writers are never willing to be self-indulgent. What they find painful is that improvement cannot be achieved overnight. Speaking of improvement, it usually refers to the improvement of thinking and expression skills. Sometimes the thinking is visible, but the expression skills are not enough. This is what is commonly called "eyes high, hands low." It seems that this is the most common distress today. However, it is better to have eyes high, hands low, than to have both hands and eyes low; because with the premise of high eyes, it is possible to raise the hands as well. Our people's art is still in its childhood, and there is a process from childhood to adulthood. This is not self-deprecation. Not being discouraged or impatient is also a necessary psychological state for the development process.

    Of course, supervision is also needed. This is a matter within the scope of literary criticism. Literary criticism, like creative activities, cannot keep up with objective requirements. Our highest guiding principle of the literary and artistic movement has long been established, which is the literary and artistic direction indicated by Chairman Mao. Under this highest guiding principle, if literary criticism is to fulfill its duties, it is to make specific analyses of individual works (or the same type of works), from ideological content to expression methods. At present, there is a need for such literary criticism, the more the better.

    Helping writers enrich their lives, helping writers improve their thinking and expression skills, and cultivating literary and artistic reserve forces—these are all already on the agenda and are already being done; now it seems that another item should be added to the agenda, which is to help literary criticism workers specialize and to reserve a large number of fresh troops for literary criticism.

    There is a need for a large number of professional writers. In literary and artistic circles, there should be a prevailing atmosphere of valuing professional writers. There are more or less incorrect views in society about "professional writers." However, in fact, eight or nine out of ten of the great writers in modern literary history are professional writers—that is, writing is their only profession. In the socialist Soviet Union, the vast majority of writers are professional writers. Make it possible for writers (or writers who voluntarily take writing as a profession) not to do administrative work and not to do chores.

    The distance between subjective strength and objective requirements will definitely shrink day by day, and at the same time, the distance between subjective wishes and objective possible conditions will definitely shrink day by day—this is the common hope of our literary and artistic workers, right? The realization of this hope still mainly lies in subjective efforts. We have reason to believe that at this time next year, our literary and artistic work will develop to a higher stage.

　　争取发展到更高的阶段
    茅盾
    今年的国庆节，首都将有盛大的文艺演出节目。这是文艺兵的周年检阅。因为它是开国一周年的第一次检阅，就特别引起人们的注目。人们将从这些演出节目中，来判断新中国的文艺“生产”是否有一寸之长。
    应当肯定：我们的文艺工作是有进步的，有成绩的，——虽然还不能满足实际的需要。
    一年之间，文艺工作者团结在“面向工农兵”的方针之下，在全国范围内所做的普及工作是有成绩的。在这里起了一定的作用的，就是广大的民间艺人的力求进步与诚心合作，大城市的戏曲界的艺人们对于学习之努力，对于演唱新戏新曲之热心，是值得表扬的。中国画的画家们也表现了同样热烈的不甘落后与为人民服务的精神。改革旧形式，充实新内容的努力，在中国固有的文艺各部门内，到处可以看见。
    工人文艺运动之开展，在过去的一年间也有显著的成就。工人作家也产生了，他们的作品在内容和形式方面都达到了相当高的水平。工厂文娱活动在提高阶级觉悟与鼓励生产热情上，起了很大的作用。
    春节文娱活动，反美侵略运动，保卫和平签名运动等等全国范围的大运动中，文艺工作者都能一致地响应政府的号召，通过各种各样文艺形式，担负起宣传教育的任务。
    全国性的文艺刊物现有十二种，地方性的（大行政区一级、省级、市级的，月刊、周刊、半周刊）现有四十二种，这都是在一年之内陆续发刊的。至于文艺创作，小说、诗歌、戏剧、通俗文艺（包括唱词，秧歌剧），连环图画等等的初版单行本，过去一年之内约计七百种。新编和改编的不少京戏、地方戏、鼓词以及大量创作的新歌曲等等还没有估计的数字，又美术作品亦无估计数字。此外，发表在全国各种日报副刊上的文艺作品也还没有统计过，大概每月有二三百万字之谱。
    特别要提起的，综合艺术的电影，在质、量两方面都有了飞跃的发展。单举一件事就可以说明：当本年春季，全国各大城市电影院上映的无聊乃至有毒的外来影片平均尚占百分之五十左右，可是到了本年秋季，就已降而为百分之二十左右。我们的公营和私营的制片厂所出产的影片已经掌握了市场。
    所有上述的文艺工作的成绩，其所以能获致，全靠了两件法宝：毛主席所指示的正确的文艺方向和文艺界同人的大团结。担任这一巨大团结工作的机构就是全国以及地方的“文联”，现在已经组织或在筹备中的地方（大行政区、省、市）文联，共计六十二个。
    文艺界同人们对于自己的工作上的成就并不满足，常常不满足。这是责任感的表现，这也是热爱祖国、热爱祖国的勤劳英勇的人民的表现。不满足产生了苦闷。这种苦闷，如果概括成为一句话，就是不但主观力量和客观要求之间的距离相当大，而且主观愿望和客观的可能条件之间的距离也不算小。
    从文艺运动方面看起来，该做的也都做了，或者正在做；然而总觉得不够。如以演剧做个比喻：台上人确是十分卖力，照规矩做，丝毫不偷懒，一幕既毕，台下人确也热心鼓掌，可是他们心里总觉得不大过瘾似的。在大多数的工作上，好像我们满有计划、有步骤，处处居于主动；然而按其实际，有时计划不免停留于纸面，或者虽能实现，效果如何却只好不去苛求；而主动之后接着来的也还有不能动，或者被动。我们可以检讨得头头是道，原因和结果，分析得很对，纠正的办法看起来也还不差；可是过了相当时期再来检讨，存在的问题依然是过去的那几个，也就是说并未彻底解决，或者只是表面上似乎获得解决。
    为什么会发生这样的情形呢？有些是因为主观力量和客观要求之间的距离相当大，而又有一些是因为主观愿望和客观的可能条件之间的距离也实在不小。
    从创作活动方面看起来，该反映的，需要反映的，都反映了；反映的多少固然不同，即以最少者而论，我们至少也有了样品。然而即使是最多的那一类，也赶不上客观的要求。这还是就数量而言。如果再看质量，那么，文艺界的自我批评向来是认真的，作家们决不肯自我陶醉，所引以为苦者，提高不是一朝一夕所能奏效。说到提高，通常是指思想和表现技术之提高。有时思想上看得到，而表现技术却够不上。这就是俗语所谓“眼高手低”。似乎这是今天最普遍的苦闷。不过，眼高手低，总比手低眼也低好得多；因为有了眼高这个前提，就有可能把手也提高。我们的人民文艺还在童年时代，从童年到成年，有其过程。这不是自解嘲。不馁不躁，正也是发展过程所必需的心理状态。
    当然也需要督促。这是文艺批评范围内的事。文艺批评也和创作活动一样，赶不上客观的要求。我们的文艺运动的最高指导原则是早已有了的，就是毛主席所指示的文艺方向。在这最高指导原则之下，文艺批评如要尽职，便是对于个别作品（或同一类作品）作具体的分析，从思想内容到表现方法。目前就需要这样的文艺批评，愈多愈好。
    帮助作家们丰富其生活，帮助作家们在思想和表现技术上得到提高，培养文艺后备军，——这都是已经提上日程，而且已经在做了；现在似乎应当在日程上再加一项，就是帮助文艺批评工作者使其专业化，并且要为文艺批评储备一大批的生力军。
    需要有大批的职业作家。在文艺圈子里，要有重视职业作家的风气。对于“职业作家”，社会上或多或少存在着不正确的看法。然而事实上近代文学史上的大作家十之八九是职业作家——即以写作为唯一的职业。在社会主义的苏联，最大多数的作家就是职业作家。尽可能使作家（或自愿以写作为职业的作家）不干行政工作，不打杂。
    主观力量和客观要求之间的距离，一定会一天一天的缩小，同时，主观愿望和客观的可能条件之间的距离也一定会一天一天的缩小，——这是我们文艺工作者共同的希望吧；这希望之实现，主要仍在主观的努力。我们有理由确信，在明年这时候，我们的文艺工作会发展到更高的一个阶段。
