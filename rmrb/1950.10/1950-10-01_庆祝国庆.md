　　Celebrating National Day
    Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League

    The People's Republic of China has been born for a full year today. Today, the people of the whole country must greet this great National Day with joy and excitement. Because the people's own regime has been consolidated, and the people's own country has grown up!

    In the past year, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the close unity of the entire people's democratic united front and the concerted efforts of the people of the whole country, the work of the government has indeed achieved good results.

    First of all, in terms of military affairs: In this year, we have successfully liberated South China, Southwest China, Northwest China, and Hainan Island. Except for Taiwan and Tibet, which are actively preparing for liberation, the war on the mainland has basically ended. In this year, the remaining bandits and special agent armed forces in various places have also been basically eliminated one by one. Therefore, the social order of the whole country has also been rapidly stabilized.

    Secondly, in terms of politics: We have worked hard to promote the people's democratic construction. Convening people's representative conferences at all levels has become a nationwide movement. The people's representative conferences in some areas have begun to exercise the functions and powers of the people's congresses, and some areas have even convened people's congresses and elected their own governments by the people. The broad masses of the people have experienced in actual political life that they are the masters of the country and have the right to manage state affairs. At the same time, the government has earnestly implemented the national policy in the Common Program, so that all ethnic groups can enjoy the right to truly participate in the government on an equal footing. The government has also organized southwest and northwest visiting groups to carry out unity work with all ethnic groups, so that all ethnic groups in the country truly become a friendly and cooperative big family. In addition, the government has also promulgated the Trade Union Law, the Marriage Law, the General Rules for the Organization of People's Courts, etc., establishing the initial foundation of a country ruled by law to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.

    Thirdly, in terms of finance and economy: In just one year, we have established a unified leadership and unified management system for finance and economy, achieved a balance of financial revenue and expenditure, curbed inflation, and stabilized prices. The government has reduced industrial and commercial taxes and agricultural taxes, and engaged in adjusting industry and commerce and restoring agricultural production. The government has seriously solved the problem of disaster relief, and is carrying out planned and step-by-step relief for unemployed workers and unemployed intellectuals. In order to eradicate the foundation of thousands of years of feudal rule and lay the material foundation for the people's democratic system, the Central People's Government officially promulgated the Land Reform Law in June this year and decided to complete the national land reform within two or three years starting this winter.

    Furthermore, in terms of diplomacy: In the past year, we have established friendly relations with the great Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, and signed trade agreements and discussed cultural exchanges. We have established diplomatic relations with several capitalist countries. Our new country has established an unprecedented position of equality and freedom in the international arena. The entire world peace and democracy camp has been strengthened and consolidated due to the birth of New China. In the movement to win people's democracy and defend world peace, New China has become a powerful member.

    These achievements are worthy of joy and enthusiastic celebration by the people of the whole country. However, we should not be satisfied with these achievements. We should unite and work harder to seek the development and progress of the People's Republic of China on the existing foundation.

    On this National Day, I would like to especially awaken the people of the whole country that our revolution "against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism" has not been fully completed. The imperialist aggressive bloc headed by the United States wants to disrupt China's independence and autonomy and undermine world democracy and peace. U.S. imperialism has used force to interfere in our liberation of Taiwan and has repeatedly sent planes into our airspace to carry out provocative acts. The U.S. imperialists launched a bloody war of aggression in Korea. The threat of war from the imperialist camp still exists. Our responsibilities in national defense and in defending world peace are very arduous. The tasks before us are serious, and the difficulties standing in our way are also many. We must not be overly optimistic and complacent because of the achievements of the past year. On the contrary, in order to liberate all our territories, to consolidate China's national defense, to stop wars of aggression, and to defend world peace, we must unite as one, redouble our efforts, and wage a persistent struggle against the difficulties ahead!

    Since its establishment, the China Democratic League has always waged arduous struggles against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. In the past year, we have made considerable improvements and developments in our organizational structure and the number of members. Now, we are a member of the people's democratic united front; we assume a part of the responsibility in the government. In the future, all our members should, with stronger confidence and more orderly steps, work with all democratic parties and the broad masses of the people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, to thoroughly implement the Common Program and strive to complete the New Democratic construction.

　　庆祝国庆
    中国民主同盟主席  张澜
    中华人民共和国诞生到今天已经整整一年了。今天全国人民必定用一种欢欣鼓舞的心情，来迎接这个伟大的国庆。因为人民自己的政权已经巩固了，人民自己的国家已经生长起来了！
    一年以来，在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下，在整个人民民主统一战线紧密团结和全国人民齐心协力之下，政府的工作，的确获得了良好的成绩。
    首先，就军事方面说：这一年中，我们顺利地解放了华南、西南、西北和海南岛。除了台湾、西藏正在积极准备予以解放外，大陆上战争已经基本结束。在这一年中，各地的残余土匪、特务武装，也已次第基本肃清。因此全国的社会秩序也迅速地安定了。
    其次，就政治方面说：我们已经努力推进了人民民主建政工作。召开各级各界人民代表会议，已成为全国性的运动。若干地区的人民代表会议，已开始代行人民代表大会的职权，有些地区且已召开了人民代表大会，由人民选举自己的政府。广大人民都已在实际的政治生活中，体验到自己是国家的主人，有管理国事的权利。同时，政府且切实执行了共同纲领上的民族政策，使各民族都能享受真正平等参加政权的权利。政府且已组织了西南和西北访问团，进行对各民族的团结工作，使全国各民族真成为友爱合作的大家庭。此外，政府又公布了工会法、婚姻法，人民法庭组织通则等等，树立了法治国家的初基，以巩固人民民主专政的政权。
    其次，就财经方面说：在短短一年中，我们已经建立起财经的统一领导和统一管理制度，得到了财政收支平衡，制止了通货膨胀，稳定了物价。政府已减轻了工商业税和农业税，从事调整工商业及恢复农业生产的工作。政府已经认真地解决了救灾问题，并且正在有计划地有步骤地进行救济失业工人和失业知识分子。为了铲除几千年来封建统治的根基，打下人民民主制度的物质基础，中央人民政府已经在今年六月正式颁布了土地改革法，并决定从今冬起，在二三年内完成全国的土地改革工作。
    再其次，就外交方面来说：一年以来，我们已与伟大的苏联及各人民民主国家建立了友好的邦交，分别签订了贸易协定，商讨了文化交流工作：与若干资本主义国家已建立了外交关系。我们这个新国家在国际上已确立了中国空前未有的平等自由的地位。整个世界和平民主阵营，已因新中国的诞生而益加壮大巩固。在争取人民民主和保卫世界和平运动中，新中国已经成为强大的一员。
    这些成绩是值得全国人民欢欣鼓舞热烈庆祝的。不过我们不应满足于这些成绩，我们更应团结努力，在现有的基础上再求中华人民共和国的发展与进步。
    在国庆的今天，我愿特别唤醒全国人民，我们“反对帝国主义，封建主义，和官僚资本主义”的革命尚未全部完成。以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团，对中国的独立自主是要来捣乱的；对世界的民主和平是要加以破坏的。美帝国主义已经用武力来干涉我们解放台湾，并且数度用飞机侵入我们的领空，进行挑衅的行为。美帝在朝鲜发动了血腥的侵略战争。帝国主义阵营的战争威胁依然存在。我们在国防上的责任和保卫世界和平的责任是十分艰巨的。摆在我们面前的任务是严重的，横梗在我们面前的困难也是很多的。我们丝毫也不能因为有了过去一年来的成绩而过份乐观自满，相反地，为了解放全部国土，为了巩固中国的国防，为了制止侵略战争，保卫世界和平，我们必须团结一致，加倍努力，向我们前途的困难作坚持不懈的斗争！
    中国民主同盟，自建立以来，就始终为反帝、反封建、反官僚资本作艰苦的斗争。这一年来我们在组织机构和盟员数量上，都有了相当的改进与发展。现在，我们是人民民主统一战线的一员；在政府中我们担负了一部分责任。今后，我全体盟员自应以更坚强的信心，更整齐的步伐，与全国各民主党派和广大人民一道，共同在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，为彻底实现共同纲领，完成新民主主义建设而奋斗。
