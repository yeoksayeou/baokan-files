　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague: The International Red Cross Association held its 21st Council meeting in Monte Carlo, Monaco, Europe, starting on the 16th. The Chinese delegation, led by Li Dequan, President of the Chinese Red Cross, and Wu Yunfu, Standing Director of the Chinese Red Cross, departed from Prague on the 14th to attend. Fifty-one of the sixty-eight member countries of the International Red Cross Association attended this meeting. The meeting discussed the promotion of the work of the Red Cross, as well as the work of the International Red Cross Association in defending peace and the responsibilities of national Red Cross societies to the Geneva Conventions.

　　At the opening of the meeting on the 16th, Li Dequan, the head of the Chinese delegation, assured the representatives of fifty countries that the Chinese Red Cross would dedicate itself to assisting the construction work of the Chinese People's Government and would cooperate with all peace-loving nations in the world to defend world peace. When discussing the revision of the International Red Cross Association's charter, the Soviet delegation suggested that a strict prohibition of weapons that massively annihilate humanity should be included in Article 3 of the draft charter. This completely humanitarian and peaceful proposal was supported by the delegations of China, Poland, Romania, and others, while the US representative led other countries in strongly opposing it.

　　When discussing the issue of the World Red Cross engaging in peace work, the Soviet delegation proposed appealing to the Red Cross societies of all member states, requesting their respective governments to immediately cease the use of indiscriminate bombing and to prohibit the use of atomic energy for war. The Soviet proposal was unanimously adopted.

　　At the meeting on the 17th, the Chinese delegation proposed an indictment of the United States' expansion of its aggressive actions to the northeastern border of our country. This proposal was arbitrarily merged by the chairman of the meeting, the American representative O'Connor, into a joint proposal by the Soviet, Chinese, and Romanian delegations condemning the American bombing of Korean civilians and hospitals. During the discussion, O'Connor again manipulated the majority vote, using the excuse that this was a political matter, to reject the discussion of the joint proposal. The Soviet and Chinese delegations expressed strong protests against this.

　　The meeting closed on the 21st. The meeting elected an executive committee composed of twelve countries, including China. The Chinese delegation, led by Li Dequan, President of the Chinese Red Cross, and Wu Yunfu, Standing Director of the Chinese Red Cross, attended the executive committee meeting on the 21st and then departed for Geneva on the 22nd for a short visit.

　　国际红十字协会举行理事会
    我代表团出席并当选为执委
    会议通过苏联代表团提案：要求立即停止使用轰炸并禁用原子武器
    【本报讯】据新华社布拉格电：国际红十字协会于十六日起在欧洲摩纳哥的蒙特卡罗城举行第二十一届理事会，我国代表团由中国红十字会会长李德全、中国红十字会常务理事伍云甫率领，于十四日由布拉格前往出席。国际红十字协会六十八个会员国中，有五十一个国家出席这次会议。这次会议讨论了有关红十字会工作的推动并还讨论了国际红十字协会保卫和平的工作与各国红十字会对日内瓦公约的责任。
    在十六日开幕的会议上，我国代表团团长李德全曾向五十个国家的代表保证：中国红十字会将致力帮助中国人民政府的建设工作，并与全世界一切爱好和平的民族合作，以保卫世界和平。在讨论修正国际红十字协会章程时，苏联代表团建议：严格禁止大批夷灭人类的武器应列入盟章草案第三条。这个完全合乎人道与和平的建议，得到中国、波兰、罗马尼亚及其他代表团的拥护，而美国代表则领导其他国家极力反对。
    在讨论世界红十字会从事和平工作的问题时，苏联代表团提出吁请所有会员国的红十字会，要求各该国政府立即停止使用滥肆轰炸，并禁止把原子能用于战争，苏联的提案获得一致通过。
    在十七日的会议上，我国代表团曾提出控诉美国扩大侵略行动到我国东北边境的提案，这个提案被会议主席美国代表阿康诺尔专横地合并到苏联、中国、罗马尼亚代表团联合提出的谴责美国滥炸朝鲜平民和医院的提案中。在讨论时，阿康诺尔又操纵了多数票，借口这是政治上的事，否决了联合提案的讨论。苏联、中国代表团对此表示了强烈的抗议。
    会议已于二十一日闭幕。会议选出了由包括中国在内的十二个国家所组成的执行委员会。由中国红十字会会长李德全，中国红十字会常务理事伍云甫率领的我国代表团，于二十一日出席了执行委员会会议后，已于二十二日赴日内瓦作短期访问。
