　　The Glory of the Miao People!
    Miao Person Pan Guangcheng
    On September 27th, the newspaper published the news of the Southwest Ethnic Groups Delegation arriving in Beijing. This made me so happy that I danced for joy.

    Thinking back to the old China under the rule of the reactionaries, our Miao people suffered all kinds of oppression from the reactionary Han chauvinists. For example, if Miao people lived in the plains, the reactionaries would say it was "harmful to hygiene," and they would suppress the Miao families and drive us into the mountains and forests. When Miao people took things to the small streets to exchange, they were often robbed by the reactionary army. If you refused, the reactionary soldiers would brutally stab you with a bayonet, causing you to bleed profusely, and there was nowhere to complain. My mother suffered this kind of situation. This is just one example. In short, in the past society, the Miao people were regarded as cattle and horses by the reactionaries; the suffering they endured was truly endless. Today, a new China has been born, and the Miao people have moved from darkness to light, from death to a new life, and have gained democracy, freedom, and political status. This time, the Miao people are able to come to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations, which is truly the first time in the history of the Miao people. Thinking of this, I am so excited that I cannot sleep.

    The next morning, I immediately ran to find the Miao Ethnic Cultural Troupe. I was received by Brother Tang Chunfang of the Miao family. I haven't spoken the Miao language for several years, and now I can speak my native language with my own ethnic brothers, which is truly delightful. Brother Tang introduced me to the brothers and sisters of the cultural troupe, and I saluted them. When they saw that I was wearing a People's Liberation Army uniform, they all called me "Dai Yong" (Miao language, referring to a person wearing a military uniform). When they talked about the situation in their hometown, they all said: "Chairman Mao has brought us a bright and happy life, allowing us Miao people to see the light of day. To be able to see the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and to be able to come to Beijing, the capital of the people, is truly the glory of our Miao people! We want to bring the Miao people's love for Chairman Mao to Chairman Mao." Wu Tingzhi (female), a representative from Lushan, said to me: "I am so happy to be living in this Mao Zedong era. When I think back to our past miserable lives, I feel the preciousness of today's happiness even more! In the future, I must work hard to participate in national construction, consolidate the victory of the people, and fight against the imperialist aggressors." Zhang Zhengxing, a fourteen-year-old Miao child, happily said to me: "In the old China, we were treated as slaves for a long time and did not know what writing was. After the Communist Party came, it helped our Miao people establish schools and study our own language. After we go back, we can go to school and study." He also told me: "After liberation, the lives of the Miao people are better than before. The People's Government has representatives of the Miao people participating in handling their own affairs."

    In the afternoon, I went to see Li Ruyun, the deputy head of the Southwest Ethnic Groups Delegation, and the Miao representatives again, and everyone warmly shook hands and embraced. Deputy Head Li told me: "The delegation was warmly welcomed by people from all over when they came to Beijing." We Miao people already have political status in the new China!

    I saw that although the representatives of the various ethnic groups in the Southwest were wearing different exquisite ethnic costumes and speaking different languages, they expressed the heartfelt wishes of the people of all ethnic groups—to love Chairman Mao and love the Communist Party—through different dances and different songs.

    Under the correct ethnic policy of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, the brotherly ethnic groups of the People's Republic of China have achieved unprecedented unity in history. From this concrete fact, I deeply experienced this truth.

### 苗族人民的光荣！

　　苗族人民的光荣！
    苗族人  潘光成
    九月二十七日，报纸上登出了西南各民族代表团抵京的消息。这使我高兴得手舞足蹈。
    回想起在反动派统治下的旧中国，我们苗族人民受尽了反动派大汉族主义者的压迫。譬如说，苗人如果居住在平原之处，反动派就说“有害卫生”，就来镇压苗家，把我们赶到大山森林里去。苗人拿点东西到小街道去交换时，常被反动派的军队抢走。如果你不肯，反动派的兵就凶暴地给你一刺刀，刺得你鲜血直流，也无处控告。我的母亲就曾遭到这样情形。这只是一个例子罢了。总之，在过去社会里，苗人被反动派视为牛马；所受苦难，真是说不尽的。今天新中国延生了，苗人已由黑暗走向光明，由死亡走向新的生活，得到了民主、自由，有了政治上的地位。这次苗族人民能够到北京来参加国庆纪念日，真是苗族历史上的第一次。想起这个，我兴奋得睡不着。
    第二天早晨，我立刻跑去找苗族文工团。接见我的是苗家唐春芳大哥。我好几年没说苗话了，现在能和本族兄弟说家乡话，真是愉快极了。唐大哥把我介绍给文工团的兄弟姊妹们，我向他们敬了一个礼。他们见我穿的是人民解放军军服，都叫我“呆勇”（苗话，指穿军服的人）。他们谈起家乡情形时，都说：“毛主席给我们带来了光明幸福的生活，使我们苗族人民见到了天日。我们能够见到伟大的中国人民领袖毛主席，能够到人民首都北京来，真是我们苗族人民的光荣！我们要把苗族人民对毛主席的热爱带给毛主席。”炉山的代表吴廷芝（女）对我说：“我能生活在这个毛泽东时代里，真是幸福。回想起我们过去的悲惨生活，越觉得今天幸福的可贵！今后我一定要努力参加国家建设，巩固人民的胜利，向帝国主义侵略者作斗争。”十四岁的苗族儿童张正兴高兴地向我说：“在旧中国里，我们长期被人当作奴隶，不晓得文字是什么。共产党来到以后，帮助我们苗族人民创设学校，研究自己的语文。我们回去以后，就可以上学念书了。”他又告诉我：“解放后，苗人的生活都比从前好了。人民政府有苗族的代表参加，办理自己的事情。”
    下午，我又去见了西南各民族们代表团李儒云副团长和苗族代表，大家热情地握手拥抱。李副团长告诉我：“代表团到北京来，曾受到各地人民的热烈欢迎。”我们苗人在新中国里已经有了政治地位了！
    我看到，西南各民族的代表们，虽然穿着不同的精美的民族服装，说着不同的语言；但是，他们却用不同的舞蹈，不同的歌声，表达了各族人民的心声——热爱毛主席，热爱共产党。
    在中国共产党和中央人民政府正确的民族政策下，中华人民共和国的各兄弟民族有了历史上空前未有的团结。我从这次具体事实里，深刻地体验了这个真理。
