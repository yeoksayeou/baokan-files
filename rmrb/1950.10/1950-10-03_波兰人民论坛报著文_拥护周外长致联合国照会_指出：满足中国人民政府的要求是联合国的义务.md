    Pointing Out: Meeting the Requirements of the Chinese People's Government is the Obligation of the United Nations
    [Xinhua News Agency, 28th dispatch] According to the Polish News Agency on the 26th: The Polish People's Tribune published an article endorsing the telegram from our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on the 24th regarding the renewed bombing of China's territory, An Dong, by American aircraft, demanding that the United Nations sanction the aggressive crimes of the United States. The newspaper began by stating, "Meeting the requirements of the Chinese People's Government is the obligation of the United Nations." The newspaper quoted Foreign Minister Zhou's original telegram stating: "If the representatives of the majority of countries attending the United Nations General Assembly continue to submit to American manipulation and continue to turn a deaf ear to this aggressive crime of the United States, they cannot escape the responsibility of sharing in the ignition of the war in the East." The newspaper pointed out: "This is what the telegram declares, and also what every upright person in the world is thinking. All just public opinion in the world supports the legitimate demands of the Chinese government: the public opinion of the entire Poland supports these legitimate demands."

    拥护周外长致联合国照会
    指出：满足中国人民政府的要求是联合国的义务
    【新华社二十八日讯】据波兰通讯社二十六日讯：波兰人民论坛报撰论拥护我国外交部周恩来外长二十四日就美国飞机再次轰炸我国领土安东一事要求联合国制裁美国侵略罪行的电文。该报首称：“满足中国人民政府的要求是联合国的义务。”该报引用了周外长原电称：“出席联合国大会的多数国家的代表如仍甘受美国的操纵，继续对于美国这种侵略罪行装聋作哑，他们就不能逃避分担燃起东方战火的责任。”该报指出：“这就是该电所宣布，而也是全世界每一个正直的人心里所想的。全世界所有公正的舆论都支持中国政府的正当要求：波兰全国的舆论都支持这些正当的要求。”
