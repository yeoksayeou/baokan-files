　　Newspaper Pictures
　　Wo'erqike

　　Newspaper pictures – are a complex and important part of the editorial work. Bolshevik, Soviet newspapers have accumulated a wealth of experience in the picture field and have developed a style and editorial method determined by the nature of the Party newspaper. The Party uses this Party newspaper to "speak to the working class every day and every hour in its own language, the language that the Party needs" (Stalin).

　　The language of the Party, the Bolshevik newspaper, is real and simple; it is understood by millions of workers, and it is prominent, figurative and accurate. The illustrations in our newspapers should also meet these requirements.

　　As one of the visual arts, newspaper pictures must meet the requirements of the socialist realism method, and should serve the tasks of agitation, propaganda and organization, and should truthfully and clearly reflect the policies of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state – the foundation of life of the Soviet system. Every photograph and every illustration in the newspaper should be understood by the people, should adopt themes that are suitable for the interests of the people, should be technically clear and easy to understand, and artistically – should be exceptionally expressive. Kalinin once said to the staff of the Bolshevik newspaper:

　　"The technology of newspapers and magazines themselves plays a great role: such as printing, plate making (illustrations and photographs), manuscript processing, font selection, titles and so on. All of these should be done carefully and interestingly... This is of great significance to readers. It is no accident that Comrade Stalin pays such close attention to every detail of the newspaper." ("Collected Works of Bolshevik Journalism," 1945 edition, Part Two, p. 287)

　　Every picture published in the newspaper should confidently narrate the phenomena of social life that are worthy of our people's pride and serve as proof of the achievements of socialist construction, and should introduce those who can serve as practical examples for the laggards and call on them to strive for new victories in labor, science, and literature, and mobilize all Soviet people to complete the great historical task of building communism.

　　That is why all editorial workers, whether they are the direct compilers of pictures or the organizers of this important work, must constantly pay attention to the struggle to improve the quality of newspaper pictures.
　　× × × ×
　　Comrade Stalin, in a conversation with the editors of the magazine "Red Youth," specifically pointed out that every publishing institution in our Soviet Union should have a certain position in its common work. The editorial departments of newspapers of various sizes and with different purposes and tasks should follow this instruction in their work, and appropriately organize literary and pictorial manuscripts.

　　Of course, agricultural newspapers should have many photographs illustrating the issues of socialist agriculture, collective farms, Soviet farms and agricultural machinery stations. In specialized newspapers, such as those in the transportation industry, the central themes of the pictures will be railway work, and the life and activities of railway transportation workers.

　　Every local newspaper, of course, should choose photographs and illustrations that reflect the life of the republic, the border region, the province, the city, and the district, and should strive to solve the national and nationwide problems with local materials, if one can say so.

　　For example, the "Gorky Commune News" published. When it announced the government's decision to award Stalin Prizes, it published in the newspaper the portraits of the winners in Gorky City, who won this lofty title for creating a new type of ship. The Saratov "Communist News" published, in order to publish this document, portraits of the winners in Saratov City: sculptor Gibalnikov and actor Mlatov.

　　Long before the start of sowing in Kuban, the Kuban newspapers published photos of Azerbaijan starting sowing in the column "Overview of the Soviet Union." These photos mobilized the collective farmers of Kuban, as if saying to them: "Look, the southerners have already started. It will be your turn soon."

　　The organization of picture manuscripts should first select pictures for the newspaper, determine where they are to be published, and send them to the editorial department in a timely manner. Timeliness and efficiency – are the most important conditions of this work.

　　Like any editorial department, the picture group must have a calendar of major events and holidays. Preparing for this or that major event in a timely manner enables you to more carefully select the required picture manuscripts (photos, pictures, illustrations, etc.), better revise them and make printing plates.

　　However, there are very few commemorative day calendars with major events. The picture group of each newspaper (or the personnel doing picture work) must maintain constant contact with other departments of the editorial department, with the secretariat, and with the editor-in-chief, and participate in the editorial department's "flying gatherings" in order to constantly understand the themes that the newspaper is paying attention to. The picture group must also maintain contact with the various agencies of the city, province, or republic: in order to learn from them in a timely manner, for example, when a new factory is about to start operation, or whether the entire staff of a certain enterprise is close to completing the production plan, or whether the production of new products has been properly completed, and so on. The work of the picture group has a lot in common with the work of the reporting group, so the connection between them should be particularly close and frequent. The staff of the reporting group and the picture group should care about this, and the secretariat and the leaders of the newspaper should also care.

　　The picture author – the newspaper's photojournalist is the "central figure" in picture work.

　　The photojournalist – is not a photographer as commonly understood. The photojournalist – is a journalist who uses a special tool – photographic technology – for the activities of this newspaper and news.

　　The equipment in the hands of the photojournalist – is equivalent to a pen; a photograph or a set of photographs – is equivalent to a news story, a sketch, an essay. Photo news, photo sketches, and photo essays should meet all the requirements for supplying appropriate newspaper materials, should be of high value in terms of content, ideologically clear, and technically very proficient.

　　When talking about the photographer's skills, it is appropriate to recall the famous saying of the great Russian artist Repin: "A profound thought is only moving in a perfect form...". For a photojournalist, he should also strive to achieve this high value of form and content in his picture works.

　　What are the requirements for photo cadres?

　　The photojournalist should be a newspaper worker with rich political knowledge, an active journalist who is good at subordinating all his activities to the main and decisive tasks put forward by the Party and the government in front of the country and the people. The photojournalist should always look for fresh, interesting, typical and educational themes.

　　Kalinin once said at a meeting of newspaper workers: "If you want to make your communications catch people, then you need to inject your own blood into it. If you write something that excites even yourself, then it will be felt in the communication and it will definitely be good and lively." Being good at finding fresh, political and realistic themes in the surrounding life, and not being limited by the original tasks, and treating every phenomenon of our reality with true creative emotion – this is the basic requirement of the newspaper editorial department for its own photo correspondents.

　　For example. The entire technical equipment of our agriculture has fundamentally changed: a large number of various machines have appeared, which reduce labor and improve labor productivity. Can a Soviet photojournalist now allow himself to endlessly repeat a photo of a combine harvester that has long been familiar to everyone? He should point out the progress of Soviet technology, point out the new type of machines and the people who have achieved outstanding achievements in their work.

　　Agricultural technology is complex, and the entire agricultural work (grassland rotation, etc.) is complex, – so, can a photojournalist who works in the agricultural sector newspaper not know all this, not study basic agricultural technology?

　　Comprehending the deep knowledge of the business sector you serve – is the duty of a photojournalist.

　　Kalinin once said to newspaper workers: "What should you learn? You should learn everything, and first of all your own profession." For a photojournalist, this means systematically and deeply mastering photographic technology, learning the technology of newspaper business, especially the plate making process, retouching, and typesetting. If a newspaper photojournalist does not work hard to learn, does not seek progress, and stops and prides himself on his seniority, then sooner or later he will become a useless person in the editorial department.

　　The photographer cannot be a guest of the editorial department, he cannot complete the task, hand in the photos he should hand in, and not care about the situation of the photos after they are submitted for typesetting, the quality of the made zinc plates, and so on. The professional cooperation between photojournalists and art retouchers can significantly improve every photo published in the newspaper, highlight the lines, and eliminate many defects that may be caused by haste or lack of photographic experience, or by difficult shooting conditions.

　　By reading their own newspapers carefully and studying the pictures in other newspapers and magazines, photojournalists can draw many useful conclusions for themselves and prevent themselves from repeating the mistakes made by other photojournalists in their work.

　　However, the editorial department can also help the photo workers create the conditions necessary for their creative progress in many places. One of them is to regularly hold photojournalist exhibitions within or outside the editorial department.

　　The experience of newspapers shows that many errors in photos are caused by carelessness, haste, and inattention. Careless selection of the background can ruin a good photo: if fragments of incomplete words of slogans or catchphrases hanging on the wall are captured in the picture – the photo is not suitable for newspaper use. The photojournalist wants to take a photo of a Stakhanov worker, but due to negligence, a character is captured in it, whose production indicators and behavior are not worthy of being published in the newspaper, – then the photo is not suitable. The "angle" of the shot is wrong, the focus is not correct, the photographic object is distorted – the photo cannot be published in the newspaper.

　　The inscription on each photo sent to the editorial department by the photojournalist is of great significance. The inscription should clearly state: what is shown in the photo, the time the event occurred, the location where the photo was taken, the name, father's name, occupation and social status of the person in the photo. Finally, there should also be some necessary explanations to supplement the readers' explanation of what is shown in the photo.

　　The caption under the photo – is equivalent to the newspaper's news report, so the photojournalist should be good at writing such news in a cultured, rich and informative, and interesting way.

　　Errors, ambiguities and incompleteness in the captions have more than once made the photojournalist's achievements come to nothing. Many good photos have not been made into printing plates and have not appeared in newspapers because the captions were poorly written.

　　These are the minimum requirements for newspaper photo workers, photojournalists and photo correspondents.

　　At the end of this section, I would like to talk about the activists in newspaper picture work. Of course, the basic "suppliers" of newspaper photos are photojournalists and photo correspondents. However, only professional photojournalists and only a small circle of specialized editorial staff are not enough. They cannot fully meet the newspaper's need for good or varied photos. Every republic, provincial and district newspaper must pay attention to creating an activist cadre of photo correspondents. By attracting these activists, the newspaper's editorial department can get in a timely manner the pictures it needs, which professional photojournalists cannot get due to distance or time constraints.

　　For republic newspapers, photo workers of various border region newspapers and provincial newspapers may be such activists. With the consent of the editors-in-chief of the provincial newspapers, and in contact with the photojournalists of the local newspapers, the republic newspapers can regularly receive the photos it needs.

　　However, activists should not only be found in the editorial departments of remote newspapers. There are also many skilled photographers in some large enterprises and scientific research institutes. If the newspaper goes to them, they are very willing to help. For example, the photographic laboratories and photo workers of some large construction projects have made great contributions to the all-Soviet newspapers, and they have submitted to the newspaper editorial departments the photos of the reconstruction of some huge buildings, such as the Dnieper Construction Project, the Zaporozhye Iron and Steel Plant, and the Azov Iron and Steel Plant. The photo workers of these construction projects often publish their pictures reporting the production achievements of the restoration workers in the republic and provincial newspapers.

　　Photojournalists who participate in various tours (geological and other) and film photographers who make films all over the Soviet Union, often take photos and can provide valuable photos, can help the newspaper editorial department.

　　In addition to these methods of obtaining picture manuscripts, there are also various specialized organizations: such as the "TASS Photo Department" and the "TASS Plate Making Department". The latter provides newspapers with ready-made zinc plates. This is very convenient for district-level newspapers, especially those that do not have their own plate-making equipment.

　　Absorbing and supplementing photo manuscripts, looking for rare and interesting photos of social activists in cultural relics displays and museums, establishing flexible and regular contacts with people and organizations who love photography, – all these are the most important tasks of the newspaper picture group or the editorial department secretariat that does not have a special picture group.
　　× × ×
　　So what are the themes of the photographic pictures that newspapers often publish? What kind of photos do editorial departments require of photo correspondents?

　　The theme of photographic pictures for newspapers is particularly broad and diverse. It includes the economic and cultural construction, labor and life fields of the Soviet people. The upsurge of creation and restoration work, the heroic struggle of the people to strive to complete the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in industry, transportation and agriculture, the achievements of Soviet science and technology, literature and art, – the possibilities for creating vivid and easy-to-understand, beautiful pictures for newspapers in terms of aesthetics and content are truly endless. When determining the themes of photos, editorial departments and photo correspondents must first follow the Party's historically significant decisions on ideological issues. In particular, newspaper editorial departments and photo correspondents should reflect in pictures "the life of the constantly advancing Soviet society, strive to promote the excellent aspects of the Soviet character that were very powerfully manifested in the Great Patriotic War... and prove that these qualities are not only possessed by individual selected figures, heroes, but are unique to millions of Soviet people" (excerpt from the decision of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) "On Theater Performances and on Improving Performance Methods").

　　Various styles, forms and methods of newspaper pictures can be used to solve these tasks.

　　Photos. Photos for newspapers – are the most difficult type of photos. Newspapers publish photos of the heads of the Party and the government, photos of Heroes of the Soviet Union and Heroes of Socialist Labor, photos of Stalin Prize winners, photos of innovators in industry and agriculture, outstanding scholars, teachers, actors and famous athletes, etc.

　　The photos published in the newspaper become the property of tens of thousands of readers. Therefore, the photojournalist should ensure the high quality of the photos, not only to be completely similar to the person, but also to convey the person's personal characteristics as completely and prominently as possible.

　　Photos intended for newspapers are best with clear backgrounds, soft shadows, and no sharp contrasts or deliberately artificial light, all of which are usually inaccurate sources. It is wrong to think that photos should use very dark or even black backgrounds, which are better published in newspapers, – on the contrary, the sharp contrast between the light on the person's face and the background and the strong demarcation of tones will make the photo printed in the newspaper a white face like a mask set off by a black background.

　　If the photojournalist wants to make a set of photos that are to be published in the newspaper at the same time "like a strip", he must use the same background when taking the photos, and the size of the face on each photo is the same. If it is not possible to use the same background when taking the photos, then the inconsistency on the background should also be adjusted during the retouching process. When taking photos for newspapers, it is best to take "front" (positive direction) or "three-quarter angle" (slightly sideways).

　　One more thing to pay attention to. Usually, large photos published in the upper half of the newspaper, occupying two or three columns, must be in a direction where the face is facing and the eyes are looking within the page. It is inappropriate when the direction of the face and eyes of the person in the photo is biased out of the page when looking at the face and eyes of the person in the photo while standing on one side (left or right) of the page. This will formally create a feeling of destroying harmony.

　　Production photos. This kind of photo is widely spread in Soviet newspapers. "There is no hero in the world greater than the hero of labor," – Gorky said.

　　Our people cherish labor and cherish the people who labor. Showing advanced workers, field workers, scholars, actors and their production environment – this is the task of production photos in newspapers.

　　The complexity of the work of taking production photos is often because the environment in which the photographed person works is difficult to photograph (in mine tunnels, in buildings, etc.). However, the experience accumulated by Soviet photojournalists in making such pictures assures us that under any conditions, successful photography is possible, and these production photos can be taken so that they are easy to understand, vivid and interesting.

　　The basic task of production photos is to convey the mechanical feeling of the labor process.

　　Group photos. This kind of photo is also widely used in our newspapers. The themes of group photos are: the learning situation of various groups, the group of excellent Stakhanov workers in a factory, or the group participating in a certain meeting, etc. Here, the newspaper editorial department should pay attention to making the characters and environment in the photos appear real, lively and natural. For example, sometimes the learning situation of a certain group is presented like this: a few people are sitting, one person is reading something, and the rest of the people are either looking at the person reading or looking at the camera. Naturally, this is a bad photo. Every reader can clearly understand that there is no such thing in life, this is the result of the photojournalist's carelessness and lack of skill. A good photo can and should prominently express "life itself", which is reflected in the characters' movements, postures and expressions.

　　In taking group photos, being good at choosing the foreground plays a huge role. If the whole group is engaged in trivial matters, this photo will give the reader a bad feeling. In group photos, it is very important to achieve the correct configuration of the characters on the picture – the space of the photo.

　　Here, I should specifically mention the issue of shooting mass commemorative meetings, various conferences and demonstrations. Various mass conferences and commemorative meetings, this is essentially a large panoramic view – a lot of participants are to be captured in it. This kind of photography requires a photojournalist with proficient framing.

　　The mood of the attendees, the solemnity of the venue – all these can only be conveyed by skilled photography. Correctly capturing the scenery of the venue plays a huge role in taking meeting photos. Successfully capturing the scenery of the venue and skillfully shooting the slogans hanging in the venue can often express the purpose and significance of the meeting in detail.

　　The editorial department must require the photojournalist in this important photographic position to pay special attention to every person who enters and leaves. If a journalist misses some interesting things at the meeting, he can supplement the omissions in his records to some extent based on the narration or shorthand of the attendees. But a photojournalist cannot do this.

　　In addition to single photos, newspapers sometimes publish so-called photo essays – a set of photos on the same theme.

　　Pictures in this format can unfold a wider and more detailed theme in front of the readers. However, the editorial department should be prevented from being too fascinated by this series of photos. Because not every photo selected from a certain collective farm or factory can guarantee the construction of a series of pictures. Only photos that complement each other and each single photo can give a fresh and interesting feeling can produce a series of pictures.

　　The set of photos by Skurikh that was published in the "Stalingrad Truth" can be taken as a typical example of a more suitable series of photos. This set of photos published on the relevant page also has independent significance. The photos illustrate the scenes of the most important period in the restoration work of the "Red May" collective farm in Chernyshevsky District, Stalingrad Province; the theme illustrated in the photos is concise and prominent.

　　Finally, there is a format, or rather, a method of newspaper pictures – the so-called photo clips. They are widely used in our newspapers. They are usually used to decorate the front page of holiday newspapers, and are often used to replace illustrations.

　　When clipping (pasting) several photos, you should first use large photos. Attempts to use small illustrations in the binding usually deprive these photo clips of the main thing – ease of understanding.

　　There are other clips in photographic practice, which are also necessary for editorial work. Here, what is referred to is the use of clipping methods to correct the photos that are prepared to be published. For example, the editorial department needs a vertical photo that is the height of a whole page, but it has a horizontal photo of a suitable theme in its hand. This photo can be modified in the clip. This is the simplest kind of clipping – "cultivating" the background (sky, or the wall of a building, etc.).

　　In another occasion, the shape of the characters in the photo – the structure can be shortened, – "compressing" the photo. It is possible to clip some photos in this way, but it must be done only when there is a special need, and of course, this should be within the limits of not harming the authenticity of the original photo.

### 报纸的图片

　　报纸的图片
    沃尔契克
    报纸的图片——是编辑工作中复杂而重要的一部分。布尔什维克的、苏维埃的报纸在图片方面已经积累了大量的经验，研究出了为党报性质所决定的风格和编辑方法。党借助于这种党报“每日每时地用自己的、党所需要的语言，来同工人阶级讲话”（斯大林）。
    党的、布尔什维克的报纸的语言是真实而朴素的；它为千百万劳动者所理解，它是突出的、形象化的和确切的。我们报纸上的插图也应当回答这种要求。
    作为形象艺术之一，报纸的图片要回答社会主义的现实主义方法的要求，就应该为鼓动、宣传及组织的任务服务，要真实而明确地反映布尔什维克党及苏维埃国家的政策——苏维埃制度的生活基础。报纸上的每一张照片，每一张插画都应该为人民所了解，都应该采用适合人民利益的主题，在技术方面要明确易懂，而艺术方面——要格外的富于表现力。加里宁曾对布尔什维克报纸工作人员说过：
    “报纸和杂志的技术本身起着很大的作用：如印刷、制版（插图和照片）、稿件的处理、铅字的选择、标题及其他等。所有这些都应该慎重地来作，而且还要有趣味……这对读者是有很大意义的。斯大林同志之所以那样精心地注意报纸的每一个小地方，并不是偶然的。”（《布尔什维克报刊文集》一九四五年版，第二部，第二八七页）
    报纸所刊载的每一幅图片，都应该确信地叙述那些值得我国人民骄傲、作为证明社会主义建设成就的社会生活现象，应该介绍那些能作为落后者的实际榜样并能号召他们在劳动中、科学中、文学中争取新的胜利的，能动员所有苏维埃人民完成共产主义建设的伟大历史任务的成就。
    这就是为什么要求所有的编辑工作者，无论图片的直接编制者也好，或者是这个重大工作的组织者也好，都要经常注意为提高报纸图片的质量而斗争。  
    ×          ×        ×          ×
    斯大林同志在与《红色青年》杂志编辑人员的谈话中曾特别指出，我们苏联的每一个出版机关在共同的工作中都应该有它一定的地位。各种规模不同、目的任务不同的报纸的编辑部在自己的工作中都要遵循这个指示，适当地组织文学的和图片的稿件。
    当然，在农业部门的报纸上，要有很多说明社会主义农业、集体农庄、苏维埃农庄和农业机器站工作问题的照片。而在专门化了的，比如说运输业的报纸中，图片的中心题目将是铁路工作，以及铁路运输工作人员的生活和活动。
    每一种地方报纸，当然都要选择反映该共和国的、边疆的、省的、市的和区的生活的照片和插图，都要尽力地，假若能够这样说的话，用地方的材料解决全联盟性、全国性的问题。
    比如，《高尔基公社报》出版了。在它公布政府关于授予斯大林奖金的决定时，它在报纸上登载了高尔基城获奖者的像片，这些人由于他们创造了新型的航船赢得了这种崇高的称号。沙拉托夫的《共产党人报》为了发表这个文件，登载了沙拉托夫城获奖者的像片：雕刻家吉巴尔尼科夫和演员姆拉托夫。
    库班的报纸在库班播种开始很久以前就在“苏维埃国家概况”一栏登载了阿塞尔拜疆已经开始播种的照片。这些照片动员了库班的集体农民，仿佛对他们说：“你看啊，南方人已经开始了。很快就轮到你们了。”
    图片稿件的组织工作应首先为报纸选择图片，确定它登载的地方，及时地送到编辑部。及时性和效率——是这个工作的最重要的条件。
    像任何编辑部门一样，图片组必须有一个大事及节日日历表。适时准备这个或那个大事件，能够使你更精细地挑选所需要的图片稿件（像片、照片、插图及其他等），更好地修正它们并制成铅板。
    但是，有大事记的纪念日日历的很少。每一家报纸的图片组（或者是作图片工作的人员）必须与编辑部其他部门，与秘书处，与主编保持经常的联系，并参加编辑部的“飞行集会”，以便经常了解报纸所注意的主题。图片组也必须与该市、省或共和国的各机关保持联系：以便从它们那里及时了解，比如，什么时候将要有一个新的工厂开工，或某个企业的全体职工是否已接近于完成生产计划，新型产品的出产是否已经妥贴等等。图片组的工作，与报道组的工作也有很多共同的地方，因此，它们之间的联系应该格外紧密、经常。报道组和图片组的工作人员要关心这点，秘书处和报纸的领导者也应当关心。
    ×      ×        ×
    图片作者——报纸的摄影记者是图片工作中的“中心人物”。
    摄影记者——不是通常所理解的摄影师。摄影记者——是一个为了本报的和新闻的活动而运用着特殊工具——摄影技术的新闻记者。
    摄影记者手中的器具——等于一枝钢笔；照片或一套照片——等于一则新闻、一篇速写、一篇论文。照片新闻，照片速写，照片论文，应当满足供应适当报纸材料的一切要求，应当是在内容方面有高度价值的，思想明确的，而在技巧方面也是很纯熟的。
    谈到摄影师的技巧时，回忆一下俄国伟大的艺术家列宾的名言是很适当的：“深刻的思想只有在完美的形式下才会是令人感动的……”。对于摄影记者说来，他也应当努力达到图片作品形式和内容的这种高度的价值。
    对摄影干部的要求是什么呢？
    摄影记者应当是一个政治知识丰富的报纸工作者，应当是一个主动的记者，他善于使自己的全部活动服从于党和政府在国家和人民面前所提出的主要的、决定性的任务。摄影记者应当经常寻找新鲜的、有趣的、典型而能教育别人的题材。
    加里宁在报纸工作者的一次会议上曾说过：“假如你们想使你们的通讯抓住人们，那么就需要在这里面注进自己的血液。要是你写得连自己也兴奋起来，那么在通讯中也会感觉得到而它就一定是好的，生动的。”善于在周围的生活中寻找新鲜的、政治性的现实的主题，而不为原定的任务所局限，以真正的创造性的情感对待我们现实的每一现象——这就是报纸编辑部对自己的摄影通讯员的基本要求。
    举一个例子。我们农业的整个技术装备已根本改变了：已经出现了大量的各种各式的机器，它们减轻了劳动，提高了劳动生产率。一个苏维埃摄影记者现在还能允许自己在长时间内无休止地重复一个早已为大家所熟悉的割谷机的照片吗？他应当指出苏维埃技术的进步，指出新型的机器和在工作中达到卓越成就的人物。
    农业技术复杂了，整个农业工作（草地轮种及其他等）复杂了，——那么，一个在农业部门的报纸工作的摄影记者，能够不知道所有这些，不钻研基本的农业技术吗？
    领会自己所服务的那个业务部门的深厚知识——是一个摄影记者的职责。
    加里宁曾对报纸工作者说：“应该学习什么呢？一切都要学习，而首先是自己的本行。”对于摄影记者，这就是说，要系统地、深刻地掌握摄影技术，学习报纸业务的技术，特别是制版过程、修饰、排版。假如一个报纸的摄影记者不努力学习，不求上进，停顿下来，以老资格自傲，那么，或迟或早他会成为编辑部的一个无用的人。
    摄影工作者不能够作为编辑部的客人，他不能够完成了委托，交出了自己应交的照片，而不关心照片在付排后的情况怎样，制成的锌版质量如何等等。摄影记者和艺术修饰工作者在业务上的合作，能够显著地改善登载在报纸上的每一张照片，使线条突出，消除许多由于仓促或摄影经验不足、或由于取景条件困难等可能产生的缺陷。
    用心读自己的报纸，研究其他报纸和杂志上的图片，摄影记者便能够为自己做出很多有用的结论，预防自己在工作中重犯其他摄影记者所犯过的错误。
    但编辑部也能在很多地方帮助摄影工作者创造为他们的创作进展所必要的条件。其中之一就是经常在编辑部以内或编辑部以外举办摄影记者作品展览会。
    报纸的经验证明，不少照片中的错误是由于不细心、仓促和不注意产生的。取背景不留心便可糟掉一张好的照片：假若墙上挂的标语或口号的片断不全的字句被摄在画面上——照片就不合报纸采用了。摄影记者要拍一张斯达哈诺夫工作者的照片，但由于疏忽，其中摄进了这样一个人物，按其生产指标及其行为都是不值得在报纸上刊登他的照片的，——那照片就不合用。取景的“角度”不对，焦点不正确，摄影对象被歪曲了——照片就不能在报纸上发表。
    摄影记者在送给编辑部的每张照片上的题字，是具有重大的意义的。题字（题辞）中应明确指出：照片上所表现的是什么，事情发生的时间，摄取照片的地点，照片中人物的姓名、父名、职业和社会地位。最后，还应该有一些必要的说明，向读者补充解释照片中所表现的东西。
    照片下面的题字——等于报纸的新闻报道，所以摄影记者要善于把这样的新闻写得有文化、充实而有内容，有趣味。
    题词中的错误、不明确和不充实，不止一次地使得摄影记者的成绩归于乌有。很多好的照片没有制版，没有在报纸上出现，就是因为题词写得不好。
    这就是对报纸摄影工作者、摄影记者和摄影通讯员所提出的最低要求。
    本节最后结束时想谈一下报纸图片工作中的积极分子。当然，报纸照片的基本“供给者”是摄影记者和摄影通讯员。然而只有职业的摄影记者，只有专门的编辑人员的狭小的圈子是不够的。他们不能充分满足报纸对好的或各种各样照片的需要。每一种共和国的，省的和区的报纸必须注意创造摄影通讯员的积极分子干部。吸引这些积极分子，报纸的编辑部就能够及时地得到它所需要的那些图片，这些图片是职业的摄影记者由于距离远或时间不许可而无法得到的。
    对于共和国的报纸，各边疆报和各省报的摄影工作者可能就是这样的积极分子。经过省报主编们的同意，并与地方报纸摄影记者取得联系，共和国报纸便能够经常收到它所需要的照片。
    但积极分子并不只是要到边远地区的报纸编辑部去找。在一些大企业及科学研究院里也有不少技巧熟练的摄影工作者。假若报纸去找他们的话，他们是很愿意给以帮助的。比如，一些大建设工程的摄影实验室及摄影工作者，对全苏联的报纸有过很大的功绩，他们把一些巨大建筑物的重建照片，如第聂伯建设工程、扎波罗什钢铁厂、亚速钢铁厂等交给了报纸编辑部。这些建设工程的摄影工作者常常把他们报道恢复工作者的生产成就的图片登在共和国的和省的报纸上。
    参加各种旅行团（地质的及其他等）的摄影记者，还有那些在苏联各地拍电影，常常拍照并能提供珍贵照片的电影摄影工作者，都能给报纸编辑部以帮助。
    除了这些取得图片稿件的方法以外，还有着各种专门组织：如“塔斯社摄影部”和“塔斯社制版部”。后者供给报纸以制成的锌版。这对区级报纸，特别是对那些本身没有制版设备的报纸是很方便的。
    吸收补充照片稿件、在文物陈列所和博物馆寻找社会活动家的稀有的有趣的照片、与爱好摄影的人们和组织建立灵活的和经常的联系，——所有这些就是报纸图片组或没有专门图片组的编辑部秘书处的最重大的任务。

    那么报纸较常登载的摄影图片的主题是什么呢？编辑部对摄影通讯员要求的是那些种照片呢？
    报纸用的摄影图片的主题是特别广泛而多样的。它包括苏维埃人民的经济和文化建设的、劳动的和生活的领域。创造和恢复工作的热潮，人民为了争取提前完成战后斯大林五年计划在工业、运输业及农业中的英勇斗争，苏维埃科学和技术、文学和艺术的成就，——就美观和内容来说，要为报纸创造鲜明的和易于了解的、美好的图片的可能性实在是无穷无尽的。编辑部和摄影通讯员在确定照片主题时必须首先遵循党关于思想意识问题所作的有历史意义的决定。特别是报纸编辑部和摄影通讯员应该在图片中反映“在不断前进的苏维埃社会的生活，尽力促进在伟大的卫国战争中非常有力地表现出来的苏维埃人性格的优秀面……并证明这些品质不仅是个别获选的人物、英雄所具有的，而是千百万苏维埃人所特有的”（摘自联共（布）中央《关于剧院上演节目和关于改善上演方法》的决定）。
    为了这些任务的解决，报纸图片的各种风格、形式及方法都可以利用。
    像片。报纸用的像片——是照片中最困难的一种。报纸上登载有党和政府首长的像片、有苏联英雄及社会主义劳动英雄的像片、有斯大林奖金获得者的像片、有工业和农业中的革新者、卓越的学者、教师、演员和著名运动家等的像片。
    报纸上刊出的像片成为成千成万读者的财产。因此摄影记者应该保证像片的高度质量，不仅要与本人完全相像，同时还要尽可能完整而突出地传达出本人的个人特点。
    预定要给报纸用的像片，最好是背景明显、阴影柔和，不要对照分明和故意做作的光线，所有这些通常都是不真确的来源。认为像片要用十分深暗甚至于黑的背景，在报纸上登载较好的说法是错误的，——相反地，人的面部与背景的光线的尖锐对比和色调的强烈划界都会使得报纸上印出来的照片成为用黑背景衬托出的假面具似的白面孔。
    假使摄影记者要制作一套像片，这些像片要同时“一条带子”似的登在报纸上的话，就必须在摄影时用同一的背景，而且每张像片上面孔的大小一样。假若摄影时不可能采用同一的背景，那么也要在修版过程中把背景上的不调和加以调整。报纸用的像片拍照时最好取“正面”（正方向）或“四分之三斜度”（稍侧一点）。
    还要注意一点。通常登在报纸上半部占两三栏地位的大幅像片，必须是面孔所对和目光所视的方向都在版面以内。当站在版面的一边（左或右）来看像中人的面孔和目光的方向偏出了版面时，就不妥当。这将在形式上造成一种破坏谐和的感觉。
    生产照片。这种照片在苏维埃报纸上被广泛的传布着。“世界上没有任何英雄比劳动英雄更伟大了”，——高尔基这样说。
    我国人民珍贵劳动，也珍贵劳动的人。表明先进的工人、田野上的劳动者、学者、演员和他们的生产环境——这就是报纸上生产照片的任务。
    摄制生产照片的工作的复杂性常常是因为被拍照者工作着的环境难于摄影（在矿坑坑道里、在建筑物里等等）。然而，苏联摄制这种图片的摄影记者所积累起来的经验使我们确信，在任何条件下，成功的摄影是可能的，而且能够把这些生产照片照得易于了解、鲜明而富有趣味。
    生产照片的基本任务就是要传达劳动过程的力学感觉。
    集团像片。这种像片在我们的报纸上也被广泛地采用着。集团像片的主题为：各种不同小组的学习情况，某工厂的优秀斯达哈诺夫工作者的小组或参加某种会议的小组等。这里，报纸编辑部应该注意使照片中的人物和环境都能表现真实生动而自然。比如，有时候某小组的学习情况被表现成这样：几个人坐着，一个人读着东西，其余的人不是看着读东西的人，就是看着镜头。自然，这是一张坏照片。每一个读者都能清楚地了解，在生活中没有这样的事情，这是摄影记者粗心和不技巧的结果。一张好的照片可以而且应当突出地表示“生活本身”，它表现在人物的动作、姿势和表情上。
    在摄制集团像片中，善于选择前景起着巨大的作用。假使整个集团都在从事琐碎小事，这张照片就会给读者以坏的感觉。在集团像片中，达到画面——照片的空间——上人物的正确配置是十分重要的。
    这里应该特别提到关于拍摄群众性纪念会，各种大会及示威游行等问题。各种不同的群众性大会、纪念会的照片，这本质上是一种大幅的全景像——这里面要摄取很多参加者。这种摄影要求一个取景纯熟的摄影记者。
    出席会议者的情绪，会场的庄严堂皇——所有这些只有技巧熟练的摄影才能被传达出来。正确地摄取会场的景色，在拍摄会议照片中起着巨大的作用。成功地抓住会场的景色、技巧地拍摄会场中悬挂的标语，常常能详尽地表达出会议的目的和意义。
    编辑部必须要求处在这种重要摄影地位的摄影记者要格外注意每一个出进的人。假若一个记者在会上放过了一些有趣的事情时，他可以在某种程度上根据出席会议者的叙述或速记来补足他记录中遗漏的地方。而一个摄影记者就不能这样作了。
    除了单张的照片以外，报纸有时还登载所谓的照片短文——同一主题的一套照片。
    这种格式的图片能够在读者面前展开较广阔，较详细的题材。但应该预防编辑部过分地迷惑于这种连环照片。因为并不是每一个从某集体农庄或工厂选取的照片都能保证构造一套连环图片。只有彼此相互补充而每一个单张又能给与一种新鲜的、有趣的感觉的照片才能产生连环图片。
    曾在《斯大林格勒真理报》上登载的，斯库里希的那一套照片可以作为较合适的连环照片的典型。这一套登载在有关版面的照片也具有独立的意义。照片说明了斯大林格勒省车尔尼雪夫斯基区“红五月”集体农庄恢复工作中的最重要时期的场面；照片中所阐明的主题简明而突出。
    最后，还有一种格式，确切些说，一种报纸图片的方法——即所谓的照片剪辑。它们在我们的报纸上被广泛地采用着。普通都用它们来装饰节日报纸的第一版，而且经常用以代替插画。
    在剪辑（粘贴）几张照片时应当先用大像片。企图在装帧中利用小型插图的，通常都剥夺了这些照片剪辑的主要的东西——易于了解。
    在摄影实践中还有其他的剪辑，这些也是编辑工作所必需的。这里所指的是用剪辑方法修正那些准备发表的照片。比如，编辑部需要一幅高一整版的直幅照片，而它手中有着一幅适当题材的横幅的照片。这幅照片就可以在剪辑中加以修改。这是最简单的一种剪辑——“栽培”背景（天、或建筑物的墙等）。
    在另一种场合下可以把照片中的人物形状——结构缩近，——“压缩”照片。这样来剪辑一些照片是可以的，但一定要在特殊需要的情况下才这样作，当然，这应当在不损害原照真实性的限度以内。
