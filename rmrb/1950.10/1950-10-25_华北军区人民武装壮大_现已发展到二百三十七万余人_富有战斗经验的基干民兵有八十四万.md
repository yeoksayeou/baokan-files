Xinhua News Agency, 24th -- The People's Armed Forces of the North China Military Region, which had a glorious record in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, have now grown to more than 2,371,900 people. Among them, 840,882 are core militia members developed from the general militia, and 1,531,029 are general militia members developed from young adults and self-defense forces.

During the Anti-Japanese War, the North China militia launched extensive guerrilla warfare, bravely and resourcefully killing and wounding a large number of enemies. They created tunnel warfare on the plains, cave warfare in the mountains, and tactics combining landmines and sniping. In particular, the joint defense operations and the capture tactics deep within enemy strongholds made the enemy restless and panicked day and night. According to incomplete statistics from seven anti-Japanese base areas such as Hebei and Chahar at the time, the militia fought the Japanese invaders and puppet troops a total of 63,681 times, annihilating 56,494 enemies. The militia further improved their guerrilla tactics in the War of Liberation. The Jizhong militia, in sixteen tunnel battles, achieved a victory of annihilating 466 enemies at the cost of 17 casualties. According to incomplete statistics, the militia in the entire region fought the Kuomintang bandit troops 77,492 times in three years, annihilating 71,558 enemies. In supporting the front lines, the number of militia members from the Taihang area participating in ten campaigns reached over 530,000.

After the liberation of all of North China, the militia in the entire region carried out new tasks such as maintaining social order, protecting production and construction, and taking the lead in production. During the wheat harvest season this year, more than 70% of the militia and young adults in the new districts participated in the harvest protection movement. The militia in the mountainous areas conducted mountain encirclement hunting to protect crops. The militia in Yuci sub-district of Shanxi alone killed a total of 69,682 wolves, wild boars, leopards, badgers, and various harmful wild animals last year.

After the wheat harvest and before the autumn plowing this year, the militia in the entire North China region universally conducted political education using production gaps. They put forward three tasks for the militia: 1. Help each other in production and become prosperous through labor; 2. Protect social order and maintain production and construction; 3. Study politics and military affairs, improve political awareness and military skills, and defend the motherland.

　　华北军区人民武装壮大　现已发展到二百三十七万余人
    富有战斗经验的基干民兵有八十四万
    【新华社二十四日讯】在抗日战争和解放战争中曾有辉煌战绩的华北军区人民武装，目前已发展到二百三十七万一千九百余人。其中八十四万零八百八十二人是从一般民兵中发展而来的基干民兵，一百五十三万一千零二十九人是从青壮年和自卫队中发展而来的一般民兵。
    华北民兵在抗日时期展开了广泛的游击战争，英勇而机智地杀伤了大量敌人。他们创造了平原的地道战、山地的窑洞战及地雷与冷枪结合的战术，特别是他们所运用的联防作战与深入敌人据点的捕捉战术，更使敌人日夜不安，惊慌失措。据当时河北、察哈尔等七个抗日根据地不完整的统计，总计民兵与日寇伪军作战六万三千六百八十一次，歼灭敌人五万六千四百九十四人。民兵在解放战争中进一步提高了游击战术。冀中民兵在十六次的地道战斗中，以伤亡十七人的代价取得歼敌四百六十六名的胜利。据不完全的统计，全区民兵在三年中与国民党匪军作战七万七千四百九十二次，歼灭敌人七万一千五百五十八人。在支援前线中，太行区民兵参加十个战役的人数即达五十三万以上。
    华北全境解放后，全区民兵又执行了维持社会治安、保护生产建设、带头生产等新的任务。今年麦收季节，新区民兵和青壮年百分之七十以上参加了护收运动。靠山地区的民兵们进行围山打猎保护庄稼，仅山西榆次分区民兵在去年一年中即打死狼、山猪、豹子、獾及各种有害野兽共六万九千六百八十二只。
    全华北区的民兵在今年麦收之后到秋耕之前曾利用生产间隙，普遍地进行了政治教育。他们提出民兵的三个任务是：一、互助生产，劳动发家；二、保卫社会治安，维护生产、建设；三、学习政治、军事，提高政治觉悟与军事技术，保卫祖国。
