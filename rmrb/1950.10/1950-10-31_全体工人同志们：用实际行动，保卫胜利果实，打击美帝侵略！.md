　　To All Worker Comrades: Use Practical Actions to Defend the Fruits of Victory and Strike Against American Imperialist Aggression!
　　Railway Model Worker Yin Xianming
　　Fellow worker comrades: This time I attended the National Model Worker Representative Conference and personally heard Chairman Mao's instructions.
　　Workers can only have status and be respected under the leadership of the Communist Party. Everyone knows that workers now have labor insurance, wages are gradually increasing, and canteens, bathhouses, and sanatoriums have been established. Even when a wife has a child, she receives economic assistance. The care for workers is very thorough. The status of workers is very high. In the old society, workers were treated like animals, doing a lot of work for little money, working from dawn till dusk, but still couldn't afford enough to eat or wear, and their wives and children lived in misery. This dark life was all caused by the bureaucratic capitalists and the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. We, the proletariat, have been liberated under the leadership of the Communist Party and have become masters of the country. We had only a few good days when the imperialists, this group of man-eating and blood-drinking guys, became red-eyed, provoking wars and aggression everywhere, looking for markets and colonies, with great ambitions. American imperialism wants to annex the whole world. But we are confident in saying: Aggression is a dream! We, the proletariat, have seen through it long ago. We resolutely defend world peace, but we are not afraid to resist imperialist wars of aggression. We must build a strong national defense force to prepare for striking against American imperialist expanded wars of aggression. We workers must actively produce on the production front, improve quality, reduce costs, eliminate accidents, ensure safe driving, and do a good job in the four preventions (防, fire prevention, flood prevention, theft prevention, and prevention of sabotage) to support the Korean War of Liberation and strengthen national defense. We firmly believe that the Chinese people have enough strength to crush the bloody wars of aggression by the warmongers, to defend world peace, and to defend the safety and happiness of our sacred motherland.

　　全体工人同志们：用实际行动，保卫胜利果实，打击美帝侵略！
    铁路劳模  尹显明
    全体工友同志们：我这次出席全国劳模代表会议，亲自听到了毛主席的指示。
    工人只有在共产党领导下才能有地位，才能被人看得起。大家全知道现在工人实行劳保，工资逐步地在提高，并建立了食堂、澡塘子及休养院。连老婆生小孩都给经济上的帮助。照顾工人可周到了。工人的地位可高了。在旧社会工人当牛马，多作活，少给钱，起早贪黑的干，结果还是吃不上，穿不上，老婆孩子叫苦连天的过日子。黑暗的生活，全是官僚资本家和以蒋介石为首的卖国贼所造成的。我们无产阶级在共产党领导下解放出来，当了国家主人。刚过了几天好日子，帝国主义者这一群吃人肉、喝人血的家伙就红眼啦，到处挑拨战争，到处侵略，找市场找殖民地，野心可是大。美帝要并吞全世界。但我们有信心的说：要侵略是梦想！我们无产阶级早看透了。我们坚决保卫世界和平，但是我们也不害怕反抗帝国主义侵略战争。我们要建设强大的国防力量，准备打击美帝的扩大侵略战争。我们工人要在生产战线上积极生产，提高质量，减低成本，消灭事故，保证行车安全，做好四防工作，来支援朝鲜解放战争和加强国防力量。我们坚信中国人民有足够的力量粉碎战争贩子们的血腥侵略战争，来保卫世界和平，保卫神圣祖国的安全和幸福。
