In the past year, the Central People's Government has carried out the following important tasks in the political and legal fields, in accordance with the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, to defend the fruits of the people's democratic revolution and strengthen the political construction of the people's democratic dictatorship:

    I. Fighting Against Disasters and Famines

    When our Central People's Government was proclaimed on October 1st last year, it was immediately faced with nationwide disasters and famines. Various disasters—mainly floods—occurred continuously in various places throughout the year, especially in the Huai River basin, which was the most serious. Last year, the total area of ​​disaster-stricken farmland in the country was more than 120 million mu, and the affected population reached more than 40 million, including about 7 million people in severely affected areas. New disasters this year also affected more than 40 million mu. The American imperialists and their running dogs, the remnant bandit gangs of Chiang Kai-shek, gloated over our misfortune, thinking that our newly born country would not be able to overcome this serious difficulty. However, facts have shown that such disasters left over by the reactionary bandit gangs have been overcome by the liberated Chinese people.

    In the past year, under the correct leadership of the Central People's Government, we have regarded disaster relief and prevention work as an important political task. People's governments at all levels have adhered to the principles of self-reliance through production, social mutual assistance, work-for-relief, supplemented by necessary relief, and have led the broad masses of people in a heroic and effective struggle against disasters and famines. This is specifically manifested in: the heads of the people's governments in disaster areas personally going to the countryside to supervise work; mobilizing the collective wisdom and efforts of the masses through people's representative conferences at all levels; establishing unified disaster relief organizations at all levels to coordinate the work of various departments; developing more than 200 kinds of sideline production adapted to local conditions, solving the livelihood of most disaster victims, and thereby promoting the development of the cooperative movement in the vast rural areas; carrying out water conservancy projects that combine both temporary and permanent solutions, with millions of disaster victims participating in the work; launching a nationwide movement of social mutual assistance and saving to prevent famine, promoting the spirit of friendship and unity among the people and the streamlining and saving of government agencies and organizations; in addition to establishing the Central Relief Committee and the General Flood Control Headquarters, the Government Administration Council has successively sent many inspection teams to promote work in various places, and has allocated a total of more than 2.242 billion jin of grain for relief of old and new disasters and for disaster relief use. At the same time, it has fully assisted more than 40,000 disaster victims to relocate to the Northeast and Northwest to settle down and engage in production; and is now actively planning great projects such as the Huai River treatment, striving for long-term disaster prevention. All these show that the basic principle of our disaster relief work is not passive disaster relief, but actively focusing on production and disaster prevention, not simply so-called "relief," but a series of work to organize the masses to fight against disasters. This is something that the reactionary ruling class could not do. Therefore, in the past year, under the conditions of national financial difficulties and inconvenient transportation, we have not only basically guaranteed the realization of the slogan "no one will starve to death," but also promoted other work and laid the foundation for the determination and confidence to prevent disasters in the long term.

    In the past year, our disaster relief work still has shortcomings. We still lack foresight and a solid grasp of the disaster situation. In general, the response in various disaster areas last year was relatively late. Later, the coordination of work among various departments was not close enough, and insufficient attention was paid to the long-term nature of China's disaster relief and prevention work. Therefore, temporary expansion of the disaster situation occurred in a few areas. After the new disaster occurred this year, the work in various places was better, so the disaster situation quickly subsided. Therefore, the basic experience we have gained is that disaster relief and prevention work should focus on the long term, start early, cooperate closely, and should become one of the important political tasks of people's governments at all levels.

    II. Establishing a System of People's Representative Conferences

    The revolutionary war has basically ended on the mainland. According to the latest administrative division statistics, the country has 28 provinces and 9 administrative regions equivalent to provinces (excluding Taiwan and Tibet, which are yet to be liberated), 12 municipalities directly under the Central Government and the Greater Administrative Regions, 67 municipalities directly under the provinces and administrative offices, and 2,087 counties, all of which have universally established people's democratic power. Except for the five provinces and two municipalities in North China directly under the Central Government, the country is divided into five Greater Administrative Regions and one Autonomous Region to lead the work in various places. The organizational forms of our power organs at all levels include 13 provinces and 3 administrative regions that have held people's representative conferences of all circles, among which 10 provinces and 2 administrative regions have exercised the functions and powers of people's congresses; in addition, municipalities directly under the Central Government and the Greater Administrative Regions and municipalities directly under the provinces and administrative offices have all held people's representative conferences of all circles, among which 7 municipalities directly under the Central Government and the Greater Administrative Regions and 13 municipalities under the provinces have exercised the functions and powers of people's congresses, and 2 municipalities under the provinces have convened people's congresses. More than 80% of the counties in the country have held people's representative conferences of all circles, among which 18 counties have exercised the functions and powers of county people's congresses, and 20 counties have convened county people's congresses. In addition, 7 banners in the Northeast, 22 banners in Inner Mongolia, 2 leagues and 7 banners in Suiyuan have all held people's representative conferences of all circles. As for district and village governments below the county level, people's representative conferences or people's congresses have generally been held in the old liberated areas, and peasant representative conferences have been universally convened or are being convened in the newly liberated areas; some districts in large cities have also held people's representative conferences of all circles.

    For more than a year, due to the development of the democratic construction movement in various places, we have clearly seen the absolute superiority of the New Democratic People's Representative Conference over the Old Democratic representative system; we have seen the broad masses of people's love for their own power and the increase in their sense of responsibility as masters of the country; once the government's policies, laws and important measures are discussed at the conference, they immediately become the material strength of the masses; we have seen that some bad work styles of government staff have been corrected through the supervision of the People's Representative Conference; we have seen that with each conference, the relationship and unity between the various democratic classes, between the various ethnic groups, between the various democratic parties, between the people and the government, and between the people and the people, have all taken a step forward. Therefore, all places in the country that have held and held well people's representative conferences have played a good role in linking the people, implementing policies, educating cadres, and promoting work.

    However, due to lack of experience, especially due to the lack of understanding of the policy of the People's Democratic United Front by some cadres, there are still some shortcomings and deviations in the work. The main reasons for this are unrealistic pursuit of democratic forms or failure to make holding people's representative conferences a regular system. Therefore, at the National Civil Affairs Conference held in July, in addition to emphasizing the necessary understanding of the People's Democratic United Front, it emphasized that the main task of the current construction of power should be to conscientiously hold people's representative conferences of all circles that are sufficient to unite the people of all circles to carry out work together, as instructed by Chairman Mao; and pointed out that the focus of local construction of power should be on the county, and the focus of construction of power in large cities should gradually shift to the district, in order to further connect with the broad masses of people and promote work; at the same time, it stipulated that the civil affairs departments of people's governments at all levels should currently focus on the construction of power, so that the regular system of people's representative conferences at all levels can be universally established. After this conference, the experience was summarized, and the understanding of the policy was clarified. It is believed that in the future, the work of constructing power in various places will be further developed with the improvement of the people's awareness and the realization of land reform in some areas.

    III. Suppressing Reaction and Establishing Revolutionary Order

    In the past year, in order to strengthen our people's state apparatus, our public security, judicial, and legal departments have taken this as their primary task in resolutely protecting the interests of the people, suppressing counter-revolutionary activities, and establishing revolutionary order, and have done a lot of work. In the past year, according to statistics, more than 13,000 Kuomintang bandits and special agents have been captured in various places. The main task of people's judicial organs at all levels is to hear counter-revolutionary cases. In the first quarter of this year, the entire Northeast region heard more than 3,400 counter-revolutionary cases and tried more than 3,700 counter-revolutionaries (including American imperialist spies). This shows that we have severely cracked down on the conspiracies and sabotage of enemy agents nationwide, and more firmly protected the interests of the people and national construction. In terms of legal work, in the past year, in addition to reviewing and approving the organizational rules or regulations of various departments of the Central Government and people's governments at all levels, important codes such as the Marriage Law, the Land Reform Law, and the Trade Union Law have been formulated, and outlines of the Criminal Law, People's Litigation Procedures, People's Court Organization Law, and Company Law are being drafted to meet the current needs of the work.

    At present, due to the continuous sabotage activities of imperialism and its running dogs, bandits, special agents, and spies in various ways, vigilance must be heightened; on the other hand, in order to protect all legitimate rights and interests of the people and consolidate social order, the people's judicial system must be established and the construction of the rule of law must be carried out. Therefore, strengthening public security and judicial work has become an important task of people's governments at all levels. This year, we convened national economic defense work, national public security work, and national judicial work conferences. First of all, we required that the distinction between the enemy and ourselves should be strictly distinguished in terms of ideology and policy, the boundaries should be drawn, and the phenomena of "unbounded leniency" towards counter-revolutionaries, one-sided emphasis on "education and reform" of general criminals, and disregard of various public security and judicial work should be corrected. These conferences have been very fruitful. However, it must be pointed out that our people's public security, people's legislation, and people's judicial work are all arduous and closely related work. The state and the people expect us to have more new creations and new constructions. We still lack cadres in these three aspects, and some of our work cannot keep up with objective needs, and some are far behind objective needs. This requires us to further clarify and unify policies and ideology, continue to clear up the influence of all laws and regulations of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, continue to train cadres, be familiar with the business, contact the masses, and make these three aspects of work better cooperate with each other, and strive to further complete the task of consolidating and establishing revolutionary order.

    IV. Strengthening National Unity

    In the past year, the various ethnic groups in China that have been liberated are showing that they have gradually formed a harmonious family on the basis of equality. The Central Government has successively sent two visiting groups to the Southwest and Northwest to enhance mutual understanding, friendship and unity among the various ethnic groups. The ethnic groups in various regions have also continuously sent representatives to Beijing for visits and inspections. In addition to the implementation of national regional autonomy in Inner Mongolia, other ethnic minority areas have also begun or are preparing to implement regional autonomy; in areas where various ethnic groups live together, each ethnic group has a certain number of representatives to participate in people's representative conferences and government work; issues related to the internal affairs of various ethnic minorities are handled democratically by the ethnic minorities themselves in principle; the languages, scripts, religious beliefs, and customs of various ethnic minorities are respected; the People's Government is also preparing to help the economic, cultural, and health undertakings of various ethnic minority areas in a focused manner; in order to train ethnic minority cadres, in addition to schools that have been opened in the Northwest and Southwest, the Central Government has also prepared to set up a national college, and plans to train a large number of ethnic minority cadres.

    It should be pointed out that although great achievements have been made in enhancing mutual understanding among various ethnic groups and consolidating the unity among various ethnic groups in the past year, due to the long-term oppression and rule of the minority ethnic groups by the past reactionary government, and due to the conspiracy and instigation of imperialism and its running dogs and bandits, historical ethnic estrangement still remains in some areas, and a few staff members in our government have also made deviations in the implementation of policies or have shortcomings in their work style, which has made our national unity work encounter difficulties and obstacles in some areas. Therefore, it is very necessary to carry out ethnic work in a planned and prudent manner, and to widely publicize and educate the ethnic policies in the Common Program.

　　一年来中央人民政府在政治法律方面的几项重要工作
    董必武
    中央人民政府在政治法律方面，一年来，依照中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领，在为保卫人民民主革命胜利的成果和加强人民民主专政的政治建设上，做了如下的几项重要工作：
    一、和灾荒作斗争
    去年十月一日我中央人民政府宣告成立，一开始即面临着全国性的灾荒，各种灾害——主要是水灾，一年来连续在各地发生，尤以淮河流域最为严重，去年全国被灾田亩计一亿二千余万亩，受灾人口达四千余万，其中重灾人口约七百万人。今年新灾亦有四千余万亩。美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石残余匪帮曾幸灾乐祸，满以为我们新诞生的国家克服不了这一严重的困难，可是事实已说明，反动匪帮所遗留下来的这样灾难，已经被解放了的中国人民战胜了。
    一年来在中央人民政府正确领导下，我们把救灾防灾工作视作重要的政治任务，各级人民政府本组织生产自救、社会互助、以工代赈、和辅之以必要的救济的方针，领导广大人民和灾荒作了英勇的有效的斗争。这具体表现在：灾区人民政府首长亲自下乡督导工作；通过各级人民代表会议动员群策群力；成立各级救灾统一组织，使各部门工作协调一致；发展了二百余种因地制宜的副业生产，解决了大部分灾民生活，并由此带动了广大农村合作运动的发展；进行治标与治本兼顾的水利工程的兴修，参加工作的灾民以百万计；全国各地发动社会互济和节约防荒的运动，发扬了人民的友爱团结和机关团体的精简节约精神；政务院除成立中央救灾委员会和防汛总指挥部，并先后派出许多视察组，推动各地进行工作外，先后拨出救济新旧灾荒及可供救灾利用的粮数达二十二亿四千二百余万斤之巨，同时全力帮助灾民四万余人移送东北和西北安家生产；现又正积极计划伟大的治淮等工程，为长期防灾而努力。所有这些，都说明了我们救灾工作的基本方针，不是消极的救灾，而是积极地从生产与防灾着眼，不是单纯的所谓“赈救”，而是一系列的组织群众和灾荒作斗争的工作，这是反动统治阶级所办不到的。因此，一年来在国家财政困难和交通不便的条件下，我们不仅基本上保证了“不饿死人”的口号的实现，而且由此推进了其他工作，并奠定了长期防灾的决心和信心。
    一年来我们救灾工作上仍是有缺点的，我们尚缺乏预见性和切实掌握灾情，去年各灾区一般是动手较晚，其后各部门工作的配合上亦不够密切，并对中国救灾防灾工作的长期性注意不足，故少数地区曾发生一时灾情扩大的现象，今年新的灾情发生后，各地工作则较好，故灾情即很快减退。因此我们获得的基本经验，是救灾防灾工作应从长期着眼，及早动手，通力合作，并应成为各级人民政府重要政治任务之一。
    二、建立人民代表会议的制度
    革命战争在大陆上已基本结束，据最近行政区划统计，全国计有二十八个省和九个相当于省的行政区，（不包括待解放的台湾、西藏）十二个中央及大行政区直辖市，六十七个省及行署的直辖市，二千零八十七个县，均已普遍建立了人民民主政权。除中央直辖华北五省二市外，全国划分五个大行政区及一个自治区分别领导各地工作。我们各级政权机关的组织形式，计有十三个省和三个行政区已开过了各界人民代表会议，其中十个省和两个行政区的代行了人民代表大会的职权；又中央和大行政区直辖市及省和行署直辖市，已全部开过各界人民代表会议，其中有七个中央和大行政区直辖市及十三个省辖市代行了人民代表大会职权，并有两个省辖市已召开了人民代表大会。全国百分之八十以上的县已开过各界人民代表会议，其中有十八个县已代行了县人民代表大会职权，二十个县则已召开了县人民代表大会。此外，东北七个旗，内蒙二十二个旗，绥远二个盟和七个旗，都已开过各界人民代表会议。至于县以下的区和乡村政权，在老解放区一般均已开过人民代表会议或人民代表大会，在新解放区已普遍召开或正在召开农民代表会议；大城市的区亦有一部分已开过各界人民代表会议。
    一年余以来，由于各地民主建政运动的发展，使我们明显地看到新民主主义的人民代表会议比旧民主主义的代议制的绝对优越性；使我们看到广大人民对自己政权的热爱和国家主人的责任感的提高，政府的政策，法令和重要设施一经会议讨论，便立即成为群众的物质的力量；使我们看到政府工作人员间的若干不良作风，通过人民代表会议的督责获得改正；使我们看到每经过一次会议，各民主阶级相互间，各民族相互间，各民主党派相互间，人民与政府间，和人民与人民间的联系与团结，均表现前进了一步。因此，全国凡是开过并开好人民代表会议的地方，都是起着联系人民，贯彻政策，教育干部，推进工作的良好作用。
    但这一工作，由于经验的不足，特别是由于部分干部对人民民主统一战线政策的认识不足，在工作中仍有些地方存在些缺点和偏向，这主要是不切实际地追求民主形式或尚未把开好人民代表会议成为经常的制度。因此在七月召开的全国民政会议上，除着重说明对人民民主统一战线应有的认识外，强调了目前建政的主要任务，应按毛主席的指示：认真地开好足以团结各界人民共同进行工作的各界人民代表会议；并指出地方建政重点在县，大城市建政的重点应渐转到区，以求进一步联系广大人民推进工作；同时规定了各级人民政府民政部门目前应注重建政工作，使各级人民代表会议的经常制度普遍地建立起来。经过这次会议，总结了经验，明确了对于方针的认识，相信今后各地建政工作，随着广大人民觉悟的提高和部分地区土地改革的实现，将会有更大的开展。
    三、镇压反动建立革命秩序
    一年来，为着强化我们人民的国家机器，在坚决保护人民利益，镇压反革命活动，建立革命秩序方面，我们公安、司法和法制部门均以此为首要任务，并作了许多工作。一年来，各地统计捕获了国民党匪特分子一万三千余人，各级人民司法机关主要任务是审理反革命案件，东北全区今年第一季审理反革命案件三千四百余件，裁判反革命分子（包括美帝间谍）三千七百余人。由此可以说明我们已在全国范围内严重地打击了敌特的阴谋破坏，更加巩固地保护人民利益和国家建设。在法制工作方面，一年来除审订中央各部门和各级人民政府组织通则或条例外，已制定婚姻法、土地改革法和工会法等重要法典，现正拟订刑法大纲、人民诉讼程序、人民法院组织法大纲和公司法等，以适应当前的工作需要。
    目前情况，由于帝国主义及其走狗土匪、特务和间谍，仍在不断地进行各种方式的破坏活动，必须提高警惕性；另一方面为着保护人民一切合法的权益，巩固社会秩序，必须建立人民的司法制度和进行法治的建设。因此加强治安司法工作成为各级人民政府重要的任务。今年我们召开了全国经济保卫工作、全国治安工作和全国司法工作等会议，首先要求从思想政策上严格分清敌我，划分界限，纠正对反革命分子“宽大无边”，对一般犯罪分子片面强调“教育改造”，及对各种治安司法工作轻视的现象，这些会议均有很大的收获。但必须指出我们人民公安、人民立法和人民司法工作，都是艰巨的并密切相关的工作，国家与人民企待着我们更多新的创制和新的建设，我们在这三方面还缺乏干部，我们的工作有的赶不上客观需要，有的还远落在客观需要之后，这就要求我们必须进一步明确和统一政策思想，继续廓清国民党反动统治一切法令法律的影响，继续培养干部，熟悉业务，联系群众，使这三方面的工作更好地相互配合，求得进一步完成巩固地建立革命秩序的任务。
    四、加强民族团结
    中国境内已获解放的各民族，一年来正显示着各民族已在一律平等的基础上逐步形成为一个和睦的大家庭。中央先后派出两个访问团分赴西南和西北，以增进各民族间的相互了解和友爱团结，各区民族也不断地派遣代表来京访问和参观。除内蒙已实行了民族的区域自治外，其他民族聚居区也已开始或正在准备实行区域自治；在各民族杂居地区，则各民族都有一定的代表名额参加人民代表会议和政府工作；对有关各少数民族内部的问题，均以少数民族自己民主处理为原则；各少数民族的语言文字，宗教信仰和风俗习惯都受到尊重；人民政府并准备有重点地帮助各少数民族地区经济的和文化卫生事业的发展；为了培养少数民族干部，除西北西南等地已开办学校外，中央并已筹办民族学院，计划大批培养少数民族干部。
    应该指出，一年来在增进各民族间的相互了解和巩固各民族间的团结工作上虽有很大成绩，但由于过去反动政府对少数民族长期的压迫统治，又由于帝国主义及其走狗匪特的阴谋挑拨，在一些地区还残存着历史性的民族隔阂，而我们政府中亦有少数工作人员在执行政策中发生偏差或在工作作风上有缺点，使得我们在民族团结工作上在某些地区曾遭到困难和阻碍。因此，有步骤地谨慎地进行民族工作，并把共同纲领中民族政策作广泛的宣传教育，成为十分必要。
