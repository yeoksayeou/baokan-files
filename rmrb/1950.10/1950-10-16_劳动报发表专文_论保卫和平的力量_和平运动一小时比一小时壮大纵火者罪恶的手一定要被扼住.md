Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 5th: Kotov, Executive Secretary of the All-Soviet Committee for the Defense of Peace, published a special article in Labor Daily today entitled "On the Power of Defending Peace."

Kotov wrote: "The people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, as well as all our friends, are unanimously delighted by the news of the great construction of communism. Millions upon millions of Soviet people are flocking from every corner of the vast socialist country to the construction sites of Stalin's construction plan. They want to contribute to the cause of peace and the construction of a communist society."

"Life in the Soviet state is vibrant, peaceful, and joyful. The collective farms are harvesting abundant crops, and the reports from various places to Stalin about the early completion of grain delivery plans are clear evidence of this. There are also reports of new victories achieved by the working people in cities and villages. No matter what kind of work the Soviet people are engaged in, they strive to make our country live more happily with their achievements."

"But let us look at the American newspapers, as well as the reactionary newspapers issued in France, Britain, and other Marshallized countries, which have become the mouthpieces of the American newspapers. What are their daily topics? They are all invariably about preparations for a new war."

"The United States and all countries that succumb to the United States are in a state of war frenzy. The newspapers of capitalist countries narrate with ecstasy the increase in military spending and the new atrocities committed by the American armed intervention forces in Korea who are slaughtering civilians. Reactionary newspapers advocate the extension of military service in Britain and France, and maliciously slander the Soviet Union and all those who defend peace and democracy in their own countries. They lure and cruelly persecute peace fighters."

"The Soviet people are calmly advancing along their own path, defending the peace threatened by the evil forces of imperialist reactionaries. The Soviet people have shown their enthusiasm and strength for peace in the recent movement to collect signatures for the peace declaration. 115 million Soviet citizens have signed the peace declaration demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons."

"The working people of the Soviet Union talk with indignation and hatred about those who are preparing new slaughterhouses. Workers, collective farmers, women, youth—all the Soviet people command their representatives attending the Second All-Soviet Peace Congress to resolutely condemn the warmongers and subject them to severe punishment. The Soviet people, together with all loyal people around the world, angrily condemn the heinous acts of the American and British armed interventionists in Korea. But the American and British imperialists are not willing to give up. They have not abandoned their mad plans to争夺 world hegemony. They provoke one after another, trying to plunge the people of all countries into the flames of a new war."

"However, the arsonists' criminal hands must be stopped. The peace movement, which is not only growing stronger day by day but also hour by hour in all countries of the world, is a guarantee of this. The will for peace of the more than 400 million people who have signed the peace declaration is a guarantee of this. Hundreds of millions of peace advocates constitute a force sufficient to effectively shatter any conspiracies of the warmongers."

Kotov concluded: "Now, on the eve of the Second World Peace Congress, the struggle to defend peace has taken on a larger scale and become an increasingly effective struggle. The reactionary forces in all capitalist countries are trying to intimidate peace advocates by severely persecuting all people and their organizations who hold democratic ideas. However, no matter what means of intimidation or conspiracy the enemies of the people use, they cannot stop the growth of the powerful peace camp."

    论保卫和平的力量
    和平运动一小时比一小时壮大纵火者罪恶的手一定要被扼住
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科五日电：全苏拥护和平委员会执行秘书科托夫，今天在劳动报上发表题为《论保卫和平的力量》的专文。
    科托夫写道：苏联各族人民以及我们的一切朋友们，都一致为共产主义的伟大建设的消息欢欣鼓舞。千千万万的苏联人民，正纷纷从广阔的社会主义国家的每一个角落，奔赴斯大林建设计划的建筑现场。他们要对和平事业、对建设共产主义社会作出贡献。
    苏维埃国家的生活是充满着活力，是和平而愉快的。集体农场的田地里正收割着丰饶的收获物，各地纷纷向斯大林报告提前完成谷物缴纳计划，便是这一方面的明证。各地并报道城市和乡村的劳动人民所获得的新胜利。苏联人民无论从事那一种工作，都力求用自己的成就来使我们的国家生活得更加快活。
    但是，让我们看看美国报纸，以及法国、英国和其他马歇尔化的各国所发行的，那些成为美国报纸传声筒的反动报纸罢。它们的日常话题是什么呢？千篇一律的都是关于新战争的准备。
    美国和一切屈从于美国的国家，都处于战争狂的状态中。资本主义国家的报纸以狂喜的口吻叙述军费的增加，叙述在朝鲜屠杀平民的美国武装干涉军所犯的新暴行。反动报纸鼓吹英法延长兵役年限，并且恶毒地造谣中伤苏联及其本国的一切保卫和平与民主的人士。他们诱惑并且残忍地迫害着和平战士。
    苏联人民镇定地沿着自己的道路前进，保卫着被帝国主义反动派邪恶势力所威胁的和平。苏联人民在最近为和平宣言征集签名的运动中，已显示出他们对和平的热忱和力量。一亿一千五百万苏联公民已在为要求禁止原子武器的和平宣言上签名了。
    苏联的劳动人民，都以愤慨与痛恨的心情，谈论那些准备新屠场的家伙。工人、集体农民、妇女、青年——全体苏联人民都命令他们出席第二届全苏拥护和平大会的代表，要坚决谴责战争贩子，使他们受到严峻的惩罚。苏联人民跟全球一切忠实人民在一起，一同愤怒地斥责美英武装干涉者在朝鲜的穷凶极恶的行为。但是，美英帝国主义者不肯罢休。他们没有抛弃他们争夺世界霸权的疯狂计划。他们接二连三地挑衅，竭力要把各国人民投入新战争的火海。
    但是，纵火犯的罪恶的手一定要被扼住的。全世界各国中不仅是一天比一天壮大、而且是一小时比一小时壮大起来的拥护和平运动，便是这一方面的保证。已在和平宣言上签名的四亿多人民对和平的意志，便是这一方面的保证。亿万和平拥护者构成了一种力量，足以有效地粉碎战争贩子的任何阴谋诡计。
    科托夫结语称：现在，在第二届世界拥护和平大会的前夕，为保卫和平的斗争已具有更大的规模，并且成为愈益有效的斗争。一切资本主义国家中的反动势力，力图以严酷地迫害一切抱有民主思想的人民及其组织，来恐吓和平拥护者。然而，不论人民公敌使用什么威吓手段或阴谋诡计，也阻止不了强大的和平阵营力量的成长。
