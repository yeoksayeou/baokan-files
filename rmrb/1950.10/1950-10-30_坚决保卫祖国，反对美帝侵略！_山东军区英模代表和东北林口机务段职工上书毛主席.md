Resolutely Defend the Motherland, Oppose American Imperialist Aggression!
    Representatives of Model Heroes of the Shandong Military Region and Employees of the Northeast Linkou Locomotive Depot Write to Chairman Mao

    Respected Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu:
    We have safely returned to Jinan. This trip to Beijing for the conference was the most honorable event of our lives. We received profound education, especially meeting our beloved leader and the central leaders, and personally listening to the instructions of the leader and the leaders, which we will always remember in our hearts, which has given us infinite strength and incomparable confidence.
    Now we are about to return to our posts and work harder to implement the spirit of the National Congress of Model Workers, and resolutely strive to carry out the tasks assigned to us by you and leaders at all levels!
    Hereby we would like to express our determination to our most beloved leader. We must continue to study hard, strive for progress, resolutely overcome our shortcomings, be neither proud nor impatient, better unite the masses, turn your instructions into our practical actions, build a strong national defense force and a strong economic force, and defend the sacred territory of the motherland, liberate Taiwan and Tibet, support the Korean people and army, defeat American imperialist aggression, and defend world peace to the end!
    We wish you
    Good health!
    Representatives of Model Heroes of the Shandong Military Region: Zhuang Xinyi, Liu Congxin, Gao Yuncheng, Yu Huahu, Zhao Shoufu, Zuo Taichuan, Sun Longjiao, Liu Xingzhen

    Dear Chairman Mao:
    We are all the employees of the Linkou Locomotive Depot of the Qiqihar Railway Administration. Today, with infinite joy, we report to you on the achievements of our work. In September, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the efforts of all employees, we have completed the repair of twenty-four locomotives in categories A, B, and C. Not only is the quality up to standard, but the task was completed five days ahead of schedule. In October, we saved 100 tons of coal and 50 million yuan in fuel costs in just twenty days (October 1st to 20th). In the future, we will continue to work hard to exceed the task before the end of the year and save a large amount of expenses.
    Dear Chairman Mao, when we heard the news of American aircraft invading our airspace and harming our compatriots, all the workers in our depot were filled with indignation and expressed their determination to turn our anger into strength, complete the winter transportation task in a fighting posture, and oppose American imperialist aggression.
    We wish you
    Good health! Linkou Locomotive Depot All Employees

    我们是齐齐哈尔铁路管理局林口机务段全体职工，今天怀着无限愉快的心情，向您报告我们工作的成绩。在九月份中，由于党的正确领导和全体职工的努力，我们已将甲、乙、丙检二十四台机车修理完竣，不但质量合乎标准，还提前完成任务五天。在十月份中，我们仅以二十天的工夫（十月一日至二十日），就节省了煤一百吨，节省了油料费五千万元。今后我们还要继续努力，争取在年底前超过任务，节省大批的开支。
    亲爱的毛主席，当我们听到美机侵入我国领空、伤害我们同胞的消息时，我们全段工友都愤恨万分，表示要把我们的愤怒，变成力量，以战斗的姿态，完成今冬运输任务，反对美帝的侵略。
    祝您
