[This article is from our own correspondent] The general direction of the rectification movement in various regions is correct, and great achievements have been made. However, leading cadres in individual units and departments in some regions have not properly grasped the correct direction of rectification, and some Party member cadres still have incorrect understanding and attitudes towards rectification, which has somewhat limited the effectiveness of the rectification. Rectification should be carried out from top to bottom, level by level, and cadres at all levels should participate in rectification. However, some Party member cadres with leadership responsibilities have failed to lead by example in inspecting work. For example, leading cadres in Nanzheng and Dali counties in Shaanxi Province in the Northwest Region did not first examine the problems existing in their own departments during work inspections, but waited for their subordinates to offer opinions, which made lower-level cadres feel worried and dissatisfied. Some said, "Let's see, in the end, it's still the lower levels who are being rectified." During rectification, the Financial Department of the Hebei Provincial Government and the Zhangjiakou Municipal Education Bureau mistakenly adopted an attitude of "avoidance" and "standing aside," only listening to the speeches of their subordinates without expressing their own attitudes. In some places, there have been obvious mistakes of "rectifying the lower levels but not the upper levels." For example, the Tongxian Egg Farm in Hebei Province regarded an administrator as the "focus of inspection." In the Southwest Region, eastern Sichuan, and seven counties including Dongfeng and Xifeng in Liaodong Province in the Northeast Region, it was also found that some middle and lower-level cadres held the erroneous view of "rectifying the upper levels but not the lower levels," believing that "the mistakes of the leaders are big, and their own shortcomings don't matter," "everything is the responsibility of the higher authorities, and they have no responsibility," or holding the incorrect attitude of "wait and see if the leaders make self-criticism first." Some mid-level Party member cadres believe that "everyone should be rectified, except me." Some even mistakenly believe that "the middle should not move, only the two ends should move" during rectification. For example, in some areas of the Tangshan Special Zone in Hebei and individual departments of the General Office of Hunan Province, some cadres believed that "the upper level has bureaucracy, the lower level has commandism, I am not primarily responsible to the upper level, and I don't get close to the masses at the lower level, so there's nothing to rectify," or that "the focus of rectification is not us, I'll just chime in with a few words when others criticize."

    In addition, in some places in northern Jiangsu in the East China Region, it was found that Party and non-Party cadres, old and new cadres, were treated the same, forming a "grabbing everything." In individual departments, due to the lack of strict self-criticism among Party member cadres, even relaxing within the Party and focusing on those outside the Party, causing doubts among some non-Party cadres, thus affecting the correct development of rectification. At the beginning of rectification in Anshan, Northeast China, technical personnel seminars and worker representative conferences were first convened for inspection, resulting in the blurring of the lines between Party members and non-Party members and disrupting the rectification. Most of these phenomena have been corrected at any time during the rectification, but some have not been clearly corrected, so they continue to occur in individual regions and departments. Attention should also be paid to this as rectification continues to deepen in various regions.

　　整风应自上而下逐级进行
    领导干部要带头检查工作
    中、下级干部也要积极参加整风
    某些地方有党内外不分的偏向应即纠正
    【本报讯】各地整风运动，一般方针是正确的，已有很大成绩；但有些地区的个别单位和部门中的领导干部没有很好掌握整风的正确方针，有些党员干部对整风仍有不正确的认识与态度，以致整风的效果受到一些限制。整风本应自上而下地逐级进行，各级干部都要整风。但有些负领导责任的党员干部却不能以身作则地带头检查工作。如西北区陕西省南郑、大荔等县的领导干部，在检查工作时，对本部门存在的问题没有首先进行检讨，而是等着下级提意见，致使下级干部顾虑重重，心怀不满。有的说“看看吧，整来整去还是整下级”。河北省政府财政厅和张家口市教育局在整风时领导干部曾错误地采取了“回避”、“旁观”的态度，只听下级发言，自己却不表明态度。有些地方曾发生明显的“整下不整上”的错误。如河北通县蛋场，把一个管理员当成了“检查重点”。西南区川东及东北区辽东省东丰、西丰等七县还发现有的中下级干部抱着“整上不整下”的错误论调，认为“领导上的错误大，自己的缺点不算啥”，“一切是上级负责，自己无责任”，或抱着“看领导上检讨不检讨再说”的不正确态度。有些中级党员干部认为“上下都应整，就是不该整我”。甚至于错误地认为在整风中也要实行“中间不动两头动”。如河北唐山专区部分地区及湖南省办公厅个别部门，在整风中有一部分干部认为“上级有官僚主义，下级有命令主义，自己上不负主要责任，下不接近广大群众，没什么可整的”，或认为“整风重点不是我们，别人发言批评，我也凑搭几句”。
    此外，华东区苏北有些地方曾发现有的把党内外干部、新老干部一律对待，形成“眉毛胡子一把抓”。个别部门由于党员干部缺乏严格的自我批评精神，甚至放松党内，偏重党外，致造成部分党外干部的疑虑，因而影响了整风的正确开展。东北鞍山整风开始时期，竟然首先召开技术人员座谈会及工人代表会进行检查，结果党内党外不分，把整风搞乱了。以上这些现象大部分在整风中已随时纠正，但也有的尚未明确纠正，因此个别地区和部门还不断发生。各地在整风继续深入的过程中还应该加以注意。
