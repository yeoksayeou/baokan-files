Businesses Dealing in Flammable Materials
　　Should Strengthen Fire Safety Equipment
　　A Letter of Suggestion from the Beijing Fire Brigade

To the Editor:

　　Recently, during our inspection of fire safety equipment in Beijing, we discovered that some businesses dealing in flammable materials are extremely negligent regarding fire safety. In more serious cases, they not only refuse to accept the advice of inspectors but also ideologically oppose them, which is unacceptable.

　　On August 12th, when we inspected the Chaoyangmen office of the Beijing Wine Monopoly Company, we found no fire prevention equipment whatsoever. We immediately raised our concerns with them, but Comrade Wang Yufu from the office replied, "We don't have a person in charge here; the issue of fire safety equipment has been reported to the higher authorities, and whether it is approved or not is none of your business. You want us to pay attention to fire safety equipment and establish an organization, but we don't have the authority to do so." After our patient explanation, Comrade Wang finally admitted that he was the person in charge, but he still adopted an evasive and perfunctory attitude towards fire safety equipment.

　　We visited the Meijian Wood Products Shop at No. 10 Guanmaquan in the jurisdiction of the Third Outer Branch Bureau more than ten times for inspection, but they always used the excuse that the person in charge was not present. As a result, on August 27th, the factory accidentally caused a fire due to improper drying of wood, resulting in significant losses.

　　Therefore, we suggest that relevant authorities should pay attention to inspecting fire safety equipment and strengthening fire safety organizations, and regularly supervise and inspect them to avoid unnecessary losses to the people's property.

　　经营易燃物品的商号
    应加强消防设备
    京市消防大队来信建议编辑同志：
    最近，我们检查京市消防设备时，发现个别经营易燃物品的商号，对消防问题极不注意。情形较为严重的，不仅不接受检查人员的劝告，并在思想上与检查人员对立，这是不应该的。
    八月十二日，我们到北京酒业专卖公司朝阳门办事处进行检查时，发现毫无防火设备。我们当即向他们提出了意见，但该处王玉福同志答复说：“我们这里没有负责人；关于消防设备的问题已请示上级，批准不批准与你们没有关系。你要我们注意防火设备，建立组织，我们没有这个权力。”后经我们耐心的解说，王同志始承认他就是该处负责人，但对防火设备问题，仍是采取推脱敷衍的态度。
    外三分局管界官马圈十号美坚木器行，我们曾去检查过十多次，但他们总以负责人不在来推脱。结果该厂在八月二十七日，因烘烤木料不慎，引起火灾，损失不小。
    因此，我们建议有关机关应注意检查防火设备与加强防火组织情况，并经常督促检查，以免人民财产遭受无谓损失。
