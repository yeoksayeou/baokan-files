Xinhua News Agency, 1st. President Pieck of Germany sent a telegram to Chairman Mao of our Central People's Government, congratulating our country on its National Day. The text of the telegram is as follows:

To Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China:

On the occasion of the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China—a new era in the history of the great Chinese people—I extend our Republic's and all German democrats' most cordial congratulations to you and, through you, to your government and the entire Chinese people.

The German people are closely watching and concerned about the construction of a democratic and strong China, which, standing alongside the great socialist Soviet Union, is an important factor in the victorious defense of world peace.

The German people congratulate the forthcoming conclusion of the economic and trade agreement between our two countries, which, through fruitful cooperation, will promote the economic development of our two countries and the further strengthening of the world peace camp.

Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic
