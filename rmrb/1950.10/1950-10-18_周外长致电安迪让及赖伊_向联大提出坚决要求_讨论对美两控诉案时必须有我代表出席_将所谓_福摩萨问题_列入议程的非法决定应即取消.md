Xinhua News Agency, October 17th—Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai sent a telegram on the 17th to Andriyichuk, President of the United Nations General Assembly, and Secretary-General Lie, making a firm demand to the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly: When the United Nations General Assembly and its relevant committees are conducting the agenda items of the case of China's accusations against U.S. aggression and the case of accusations against the U.S. for violating China's airspace, strafing and bombing Chinese territory, and shelling Chinese ships, representatives from our country must be present to state their opinions and participate in the discussions; and severely protested the unreasonable inclusion of the so-called "Formosa Question" proposed by the U.S. by the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly on the agenda of the General Assembly, and firmly demanded that the General Assembly revoke this illegal decision. The text of the telegram is as follows: Mr. Andriyichuk, President of the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, and Secretary-General Lie, Lake Success, New York:

	The Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly officially passed on September 26, 1950, to include the case of China's accusation against U.S. aggression proposed by the Soviet representative on the agenda of the General Assembly. On October 7, 1950, the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly also officially passed to include the case of accusing the U.S. of violating China's airspace, strafing and bombing Chinese territory, and shelling Chinese ships on the agenda of the General Assembly. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legal government representing the Chinese people and has every right and necessity to send its delegation to participate in and attend the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. I now, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, make a firm demand to the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly: When the United Nations General Assembly and the relevant committees under the General Assembly are conducting the above two agenda items, representatives from the People's Republic of China must be present to state their opinions and participate in the discussions. This is an inherent right of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and a legitimate demand that fully conforms to the spirit of the United Nations Charter, which no one is allowed to obliterate. If the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly conducts the above agenda items without the presence and participation of representatives from the People's Republic of China, all resolutions made will be illegal and therefore invalid.

	On October 7, 1950, the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly unreasonably included the so-called "Formosa Question" proposed by the United States on the agenda of the General Assembly. The reason why the United States proposed this motion is obviously an attempt to usurp the name of the United Nations to interfere in China's internal affairs and infringe upon China's territory and sovereignty. Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. This is not only a historical fact, but also confirmed by the status quo after Japan's surrender, and also determined by the Cairo Declaration of 1943 and the Potsdam Declaration of 1945. Regarding Taiwan, what exists today is only the fact of the United States' aggression against China's territory of Taiwan, and there is no so-called "Formosa Question" regarding the status or future of Taiwan. Under the manipulation of the United States, the United Nations General Assembly actually passed the inclusion of the so-called "Formosa Question" on the agenda, which is an unreasonable decision that violates the United Nations Charter and international law. I now, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the 475 million Chinese people, lodge a serious protest to the United Nations General Assembly, and firmly oppose the inclusion of the so-called "Formosa Question" proposed by the United States, which infringes upon China's sovereignty and independence, on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly or any other meeting, and firmly demand that the United Nations General Assembly revoke this illegal decision.

　　周外长致电安迪让及赖伊
    向联大提出坚决要求
    讨论对美两控诉案时必须有我代表出席
    将所谓“福摩萨问题”  列入议程的非法决定应即取消
    【新华社十七日讯】外交部周恩来部长于十七日致电联合国大会主席安迪让及秘书长赖伊，向联合国第五届大会提出坚决要求：在联合国大会及其所属有关委员会进行美国侵略中国的控诉案及控诉美国侵犯中国领空、扫射与轰炸中国领土及炮轰中国船只案两项议程时，必须有我国代表出席陈述意见和参加讨论；并严重抗议联合国第五届大会将美国提出的所谓“福摩萨问题”无理地列入大会议程，坚决要求大会取消此项非法决定。电文如下：纽约成功湖联合国第五届大会主席安迪让先生及秘书长赖伊先生：
    一九五○年九月二十六日联合国第五届大会业已正式通过将苏联代表所提关于美国侵略中国的控诉案列入大会议程。一九五○年十月七日联合国第五届大会并已正式通过将控诉美国侵犯中国领空扫射与轰炸中国领土及炮轰中国船只案列入大会议程。中华人民共和国中央人民政府是代表中国人民的唯一合法政府，完全有权利和必要派遣自己的代表团参加和出席联合国第五届大会。我现在代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府向联合国第五届大会提出坚决要求：在联合国大会以及大会所属有关委员会进行上述两项议程时，必须有中华人民共和国的代表出席陈述意见，并参加讨论。这是中华人民共和国中央人民政府应有的权利，完全符合联合国宪章精神的正当要求，不容许任何人加以抹杀。联合国第五届大会如果在没有中华人民共和国代表出席和参加讨论的情况下进行上述议程，则其所作的一切决议都将是非法的，因而也将是无效的。
    一九五○年十月七日联合国第五届大会毫无理由地将美国提出的所谓“福摩萨问题”列入大会议程。美国之所以提出这一议案，显然是企图盗用联合国名义，来干涉中国内政，侵犯中国领土与主权。台湾是中国领土之不可分割的一部分，这不仅是历史事实，又为日本投降后的现状所肯定，而且也为一九四三年的开罗宣言及一九四五年的波茨坦宣言所确定。关于台湾，今天存在的只有美国侵略中国领土台湾的事实，并不存在关于台湾的地位或前途的所谓“福摩萨问题”。联合国大会在美国操纵之下，竟然通过将所谓“福摩萨问题”列入议程，这是违反联合国宪章和国际法的无理决定。我现代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府和四亿七千五百万中国人民向联合国大会提出严重抗议，并坚决反对将美国所提侵犯中国主权与独立的所谓“福摩萨问题”列入联合国大会或其他任何会议的议程和坚决要求联合国大会取消此项非法决定。

      一九五○年十月十七日于北京
