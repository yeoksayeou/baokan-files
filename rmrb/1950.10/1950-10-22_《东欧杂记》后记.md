　　Postscript to "Eastern European Miscellany"
　　Feng Zhi
　　Editor's Note: Starting from issue 56 (July 9th), this journal has successively published nine articles of Mr. Feng Zhi's "Eastern European Miscellany." There are also three articles, "A Trip to Potsdam," "Moscow," and "New China in Eastern Europe," which have been published in "Beijing Literature," "People's Literature," and "New Observation," respectively. These "Miscellanies" will soon be compiled and published. This is the postscript to the collection.

　　On March 30, 1950, I arrived in Moscow and took a plane to Budapest the next morning. Ten days later, I flew back to Moscow from Budapest. I stayed near Red Square for nearly twenty days, and on April 29, I flew to Berlin. On May 4, I arrived in Prague, and on May 26, I returned to Berlin. On June 4, I flew back to Moscow again, and on June 7, I left Moscow for home. I stayed in Eastern Europe for two months and eight days, passing through the countries of Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic, besides the great Soviet Union. Poland, I flew over, stopping twice at Warsaw's airport, where I only saw a few buildings next to the airport, with the bright and eye-catching Polish flag, white on top and red on the bottom, fluttering above. Time was limited, the area was limited, and the things I came into contact with could not be explored in depth, and were not comprehensive enough. Now, I have sorted out some of my experiences and written them into twelve short articles, which are not systematic, and can only be called miscellanies.
　　In addition, there are unforgettable things that have not been written in the miscellanies, and I can only record them here as a supplement:
　　What I find hard to forget is a conversation with a Bulgarian female tractor driver. On the day of the All-German Youth Congress parade in Berlin, she met us on the reviewing stand, and she enthusiastically wanted to talk to us to learn about the situation in New China. Through translation, she said that this was the first time she had seen Chinese people. She said that if Bulgaria had not been liberated, she would rarely have the opportunity to go beyond the borders of her village, let alone to Berlin. She cared about Chinese women, and she asked what percentage of women in the Chinese People's Government were working, how many female representatives were in the CPPCC, how many tractors China had, and how many female tractor drivers. At the same time, she took out several Dimitrov commemorative badges from her pocket and gave one to each of us. Her conversation was simple and sincere, and finally she repeated that she used to be confined to a small village, unaware of things outside this village, but now her vision has expanded, expanding to Taiwan in the Eastern Sea.
　　What I find hard to forget is a Greek child. Also in Berlin, one day we went to visit the Young Pioneer Republic and were surrounded by thousands upon thousands of children. They scrambled to shake our hands and ask us to sign autographs. In the midst of the confusion, a brown-skinned child appeared before us, with wide eyes, holding the flag of democratic Greece in his hand. The staff of the Young Pioneer Republic told us: "The Greek democratic fighters are engaged in a difficult struggle against the royalist fascists in the country and cannot take care of their children, so they are sending them to friendly countries to be raised. There are several Greek children's teams in this republic, and several thousand more Greek children will be sent to Germany soon." We then shook hands tightly with this Greek child, wishing his parents a speedy victory so that they could take him back to his homeland sooner.
　　What I find hard to forget is the Young Pioneer Railway on the Liberty Mountain in Budapest. The railway is ten kilometers long, with four or five stops along the way. Apart from the drivers on the train who are adult technicians, each station has one or two adults to guide them, and most of the work is done by outstanding children from the Young Pioneers aged ten to fourteen in rotation. Here, they are learning to be disciplined, punctual, and serve the people. On the afternoon of April 1st, we took this electric train through the tender green woods on the mountain, and were welcomed at every stop, receiving many wildflowers and weeds just picked from the mountain from their hands.
　　What I find hard to forget are some of the folk dances I saw in Hungary and Czechoslovakia. People wear colorful costumes and play folk music: reality and fantasy, seriousness and humor, strength and beauty, are all combined in the dance, showing the joy of life. The form of the dance is old, but the joyful emotion is new because it has a new social foundation after liberation.
　　What I find hard to forget is the friendship of the Soviet people. In the Soviet Union, whether on trains or on the streets, whenever we Chinese people who do not understand Russian encountered difficulties, someone would automatically come to help us. In other countries, almost every Soviet person we happened to meet was enthusiastic, straightforward, and like a good friend of many years.
　　Finally, I want to rewrite the last two sentences of the "Moscow" miscellany:
　　"During the day, we see the endless stream of pilgrims in front of Lenin's Mausoleum.
　　At night, we watch the light of the red star on the Kremlin tower, which is forever immortal."
　　Because this is the most unforgettable thing for guests who have stayed in hotels near Moscow's Red Square.

### 《东欧杂记》后记

　　《东欧杂记》后记
    冯至
    编者按：本刊自第五十六期（七月九日）起，陆续刊载了冯至先生所作《东欧杂记》九篇，尚有《波茨坦纪游》、《莫斯科》、《新中国在东欧》等三篇已先后分别发表在《北京文艺》、《人民文学》、《新观察》等刊物。这些《杂记》即将编集出版，这里刊出的是集子的《后记》。
    一九五○年三月三十日，到了莫斯科，第二天清早，乘飞机到布达佩斯。十天后，从布达佩斯飞回莫斯科。在红场旁住了将近二十天，四月二十九日飞到柏林。五月四日到布拉格，二十六日重到柏林。六月四日又飞回莫斯科，七日离莫斯科回国。在东欧停留了两个月零八天，经过的国家除了伟大的苏联有匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国；波兰，是从天空飞过的，在华沙的飞机场停了两次，所看见的只有飞机场旁的几座建筑，上边飘扬着上白下红鲜明耀目的波兰国旗。时间有限，地域有限，接触的事物既不能深入，更不够全面。如今把一些见闻略加清理，写成十二篇短文，不成系统，只能说是杂记。
    此外却还有难于忘记的事，没有写在杂记里，我只能在这里记下来，作为补充：
    我难于忘记的，是和一个保加利亚女拖拉机手的谈话。在柏林全德青年大会游行的那天，她在检阅台上遇见我们，她热烈地要和我们谈话，要知道新中国的情形。通过翻译，她说这是第一次看见中国人。她说，若不是保加利亚解放了，不用说到柏林，就是走出乡村的边界都很少有机会。她关心中国的妇女，她问中国人民政府里有多少百分比的妇女在工作，政协里有多少女代表，中国有多少拖拉机，多少女拖拉机手。同时她从衣袋里掏出几个季米特洛夫纪念章，送给我们每人一个。她的谈话朴素而诚挚，最后她重复着说，她从前只局限在小小的乡村里，不知道这乡村以外的事，如今她的眼光扩大了，扩大到东方大海里的台湾。
    我难于忘记的，是一个希腊的儿童。也是在柏林，一天我们去参观少年先锋队共和国，被成千成万的儿童围住。他们争着向我们握手，请我们签名。正在忙乱的时刻，我们面前出现了一个褐色皮肤的儿童，睁着大眼睛，手里举着民主希腊的旗帜。少先共和国里的工作干部向我们说：“希腊的民主战士正在国内进行艰苦的反保皇法西斯的斗争，无法照顾自己的子女，因此把他们送到友好的国家抚养。在这共和国里就有几队希腊儿童队，最近还要有几千个希腊儿童送到德国来。”我们于是和这希腊儿童紧紧握手，祝他的父母迅速获得胜利，好早一些接他回到祖国去。
    我难于忘记的，是布达佩斯自由山上的少年先锋队铁路。铁路长十公里，沿路有四五站，除去车上的司机是成年的技师，每站上有一两个成年人指导外，大部分的工作都由少先队里十岁到十四岁的优秀儿童轮流担任。他们在这里学习着守纪律，守时刻，为人民服务。我们在四月一日的下午，乘坐这列电力火车，穿过山上嫩绿的树林，每到一站都受到他们的欢迎，从他们手中接受许多刚刚从山上采来的野花野草。
    我难于忘记的，是在匈牙利和捷克斯洛伐克看见的一些民间舞蹈。人们穿着彩色的服装，奏着民间的音乐：现实与幻想，严肃与诙谐，力与美，都在舞蹈里结合，表现出生活的欢悦。舞蹈的形式是旧的，欢悦的情绪是新的，因为它有了解放后新的社会基础。
    我难于忘记的，是苏联人的友谊。在苏联境内，无论是火车里，或是大街上，我们不解俄语的中国人每逢遇到困难时，便会有人自动地走来帮助我们。在其他国家，我们偶然遇到的苏联人，几乎没有一个不是热诚的，直率的，像是多年的好朋友一般。
    最后，我要重写一遍《莫斯科》杂记里结尾的两句话：
    “在白天，我们看见列宁墓前参拜者的行列是永久不断的。
    在夜里，我们望着克里姆林宫塔顶上红星的光芒是永久不灭的。”
    因为这对于莫斯科红场旁旅馆里住过的客人是最难于忘记的。
