Xinhua News Agency Report:

Since August, material exchange in the Central South region has been active, and market transaction volume has increased significantly.

Most rural areas in the Central South region reported good harvests in both the summer and autumn seasons this year. To prevent low grain prices from hurting farmers, local people's governments and state-owned trading companies have been uniting with private merchants since the end of July to purchase large quantities of grain, cotton, and other major agricultural products, as well as various sideline products. Local People's Banks have appropriately issued a batch of agricultural loans based on the needs of farmers. At the same time, provincial and municipal people's governments and state-owned companies have continued to adjust the relationship between industry and commerce and between public and private sectors in various cities. The Central South Financial and Economic Committee announced a plan in mid-August to adjust prices, making a general adjustment to prices throughout the region. State-owned transportation departments and banks have also provided support to private transportation and sales businesses and agricultural product processing and storage industries by appropriately reducing freight rates and providing remittance, loans, and other means. Therefore, since August, market transactions in various places have clearly become more active. In August, the transaction volume of various major necessities in the Wuhan market, compared with July: rice increased six times, cotton cloth increased by 134%, edible oil increased by 71%, and cotton increased by 42%. Comparing the first ten days of September with the last ten days of August: the transaction volume of rice, wheat, cotton cloth, cotton yarn, etc. has increased again. Other local products such as ramie and raw silk also have good sales. The sales volume of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, edible salt, tea oil, etc. in the Changsha market in Hunan in August also increased significantly compared to June. Since new wheat entered the market in June, the markets in various cities in Henan Province began to become active. With the large-scale marketing of autumn grain in August, coupled with the completion of land reform in half of the province, the enthusiasm for production among farmers has increased, income has increased, and market transactions have become more active. In August, the output of cloth in Luoyang City was only 200 bolts, but the total sales, including inventory, reached 259 bolts; the total output of socks was 3,891 dozen, and the sales reached 4,073 dozen. Many factories and shops have sold off old goods that have been sluggish for a long time. The sales of agricultural tools and handicraft equipment in the city are particularly good. In August, iron factories produced 147 cotton gins, but sales reached 196.

Due to the brisk sales of goods, the turnover of many private industrial and commercial enterprises engaged in legitimate business has greatly increased, and the business confidence of private industrialists and businessmen has generally improved. Many industrialists and businessmen have increased their capital and purchased goods in large quantities. In August, the amount of RMB remitted by private industrialists and businessmen in Changsha to Shanghai for purchasing goods through the Hunan Provincial People's Bank increased by 120% compared to July. The RMB remitted by Hankou private merchants for adding goods in late August averaged 7.1 billion yuan per day, an increase of more than 400 million yuan compared to the average in the first ten days of the month. At the same time, the number of newly opened private industrial and commercial enterprises in various cities is increasing, and the number of those suspending operations is gradually decreasing. In August, the total number of private industrial and commercial enterprises approved to open in Guangzhou was 1,233, mostly in textiles, metal manufacturing, and import and export industries. Among them, there were 1,101 commercial enterprises, double the number in July. During the same period, only 143 private industrial and commercial enterprises in the city suspended operations, a decrease of about half compared to July. In August, the private automobile transportation industry in Nanning increased from nine to twenty-one; the number of ships operating on various routes also increased from seven to twenty-three.

　　中南区组织私商收购农副产品
    市场趋活跃交易量增加
    【新华社讯】八月份以来，中南区物资交流活跃，市场交易量大增。
    中南大部农村，今年夏秋两季均告丰收。各地人民政府及国营贸易公司为防止谷贱伤农，七月底起即团结私商大量收购粮食和棉花等主要农产品和其他各种副业产品。各地人民银行针对农民的需要，适当发放了一批农业贷款。同时，各省、市人民政府及国营公司在各城市继续调整工商业及公私关系。中南财政经济委员会在八月中旬公布调整物价的方案，对全区物价作了一次普遍的调整。国营交通部门和银行也通过适当减低运价及押汇、贷款等方式对私营运销事业及农产品加工、贮藏业进行了扶助。因此从八月以来，各地市场交易显见活跃。八月份武汉市场各种主要必需品的成交量，与七月份比较：稻谷增加六倍，棉布增加百分之一百三十四，食油增加百分之七十一，棉花增加百分之四十二。九月上旬与八月下旬比较：大米、小麦、棉布、棉纱等的成交量又都有了增加，其他如苎麻、生丝等土产品，销路亦好。湖南长沙市场八月份的棉纱、棉布、食盐、茶油等的销售量也较六月份增加很多。河南省各城市，自六月份新麦登场后，市场即开始活跃，至八月份秋粮大量上市，加以全省一半地区土地改革完成，农民生产情绪提高，收入增加，市场交易更形活跃。八月份洛阳市布匹产量只二百匹，连存货在内销出共达二百五十九匹，线袜总产量三千八百九十一打，销出达四千零七十三打。许多工厂、商店把过去长久滞销的陈货，都脱售了。该市农具及手工业器械销路尤好。八月份各铁工厂制成轧花机一百四十七部，销出的竟达一百九十六部。
    由于货物畅销，许多从事正当经营的私营工商业的营业额大为增加，私营工商业者的经营信心普遍提高。许多工商业者都纷纷增加资金，大量进货。长沙市私营工商业者八月份经由湖南省人民银行汇往上海办货的人民币，较七月份增加百分之一百二十。汉口私商八月下旬汇出添货的人民币，平均每天达七十一亿，较上旬平均数增加四亿余元。与此同时，各城市私营工商业新开业者，也日益增加，停歇者日渐减少。广州市八月份经核准开业的私营工商业总数一千二百三十三家，大部为纺织、五金制造及进出口业。其中商业共一千一百零一家，比七月份增加一倍。同期该市私营工商业停歇业者仅一百四十三家，较七月份减少约一半。八月份南宁私营汽车运输业，已由九家增到二十一家；行驶各线的轮船，也由七艘增到二十三艘。
