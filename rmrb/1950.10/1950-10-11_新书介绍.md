New Book Introduction
News Work Series:
    How to Lead a Party Newspaper?
    Mass Work of Newspaper Editorial Department
    (Published by Living · Reading · New Knowledge Sanlian Bookstore)

    "How to Lead a Party Newspaper?" selects two articles, "The Organization of Provincial Newspaper Editorial Department Work" and "On Newspaper Commentary." In order to illustrate the various styles of commentary mentioned in "On Newspaper Commentary," three "Newspaper Commentary" articles from "Pravda," nine "Newspaper Tour" articles, and five "Recent Mail" articles were selected and translated. These articles are extremely helpful for us to improve the organizational form and working methods of newspaper editorial departments, and for leaders at all levels to guide the work of local newspapers by using newspaper commentary. In addition, this book also selects the article "Give All Assistance to District-Level Newspapers" and four letters titled "Striving for a Fighting District-Level Newspaper" written to the "Pravda" editorial department by the editors-in-chief of Soviet district-level newspapers. These articles not only put forward principled instructions for the leadership work of local newspapers below the provincial level, but also draw a vivid picture of the close integration of Soviet newspaper editorial departments with the local people's lives, which is of great inspiration for improving our work.

    The book "Mass Work of Newspaper Editorial Department" selects five papers: "Mass Work of Newspaper Editorial Department," "How Newspaper Editorial Department Handles Workers' Letters," "Author Activists - The Cornerstone of Newspapers and Periodicals," "The Problem of Worker-Peasant Correspondents," and "Treat Workers' Letters with Caution." These articles provide detailed discussions of the two main issues in the mass work of newspaper editorial departments: readers' letters and worker-peasant correspondents, from theory to practical handling. It tells us about the broad mass character of Soviet newspapers and how Soviet newspaper editorial departments scientifically handle such a large and complex mass work. For Chinese journalists who are developing reader letters and worker-peasant correspondent work, these papers are very important reference materials.

    Several major papers included in these two collections have been published in "News Work" successively, and have had a good impact on improving our newspaper work. Now it is printed in the form of a series, and many new supplementary materials have been added, making the content more complete. Past facts have proved that the advanced experience of Soviet news work is the best mirror for our newspaper work. Only by studying the news science ideology and news work experience of the Bolshevik Party established by Lenin and Stalin can we run the people's newspapers well. Therefore, these two small books that introduce some Soviet news work experience are still worth recommending to readers of "News Work."

　　新书介绍
    新闻工作丛书：
    怎样领导党报？
    报纸编辑部的群众工作
    （生活  读书  新知三联书店出版）
    《怎样领导党报？》选辑了《省级报纸编辑部工作的组织》，《论报刊述评》两篇文章。为了举例说明《论报刊述评》中的各种体裁的述评文字，并选译了《真理报》的三篇《报刊述评》，九篇《报纸巡礼》和五篇《最近来邮》。这些文章对于我们改进报纸编辑部的组织形式和工作方法，对于各级领导报纸运用报纸述评的方式领导地方报纸的工作，有极大的帮助。另外，这一本书中还选辑了《给区级报纸以一切的帮助》一文，和以《为战斗的区级报纸而斗争》为题的四个苏联区级报纸主编写给《真理报》编辑部的信。这些文章不仅对于省级以下的地方报纸的领导工作提出了原则性的指示，而且给我们画出了一幅苏联报纸编辑部与当地人民生活密切结合的生动的图画，对于改进我们的工作有很大的启发。
    《报纸编辑部的群众工作》一书，选集了《报纸编辑部的群众工作》，《报纸编辑部怎样处理劳动者的来信》，《作者积极分子——报刊的柱石》，《工农通讯员问题》和《慎重对待劳动者的来信》五篇论文。这些文章对于报纸编辑部群众工作中的两个主要问题：读者来信和工农通讯员，从理论到实际处理都作了详细的论述。它告诉我们苏联报纸的广大的群众性，和苏联报纸编辑部怎样科学地处理这样庞大的繁复的群众工作。对于正在开展读者来信和工农通讯员工作的我国新闻工作者，这些论文是很重要的参考材料。
    收在这两个集子中的几篇主要论文，曾陆续在《新闻工作》发表过，对于改进我们的报纸工作有过很好的影响。现在以丛书形式印行出来，又增加了许多新的补充材料，内容更为完整。过去的事实已经证明，苏联新闻工作的先进经验，是我国报纸工作的最好的借镜。只有好好学习由列宁斯大林所建立起来的布尔什维克党的新闻学思想和新闻工作经验，才能办好人民的报纸。因此，这两本介绍了一部分苏联新闻工作经验的小书，仍是值得向《新闻工作》的读者推荐的。
