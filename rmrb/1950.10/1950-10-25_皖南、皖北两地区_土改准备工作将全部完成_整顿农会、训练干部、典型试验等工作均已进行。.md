　　Southern and Northern Anhui Areas

    Preparation for Land Reform to be Completed Soon
    Rectification of Farmers' Associations, Training of Cadres, and Pilot Experiments Have All Been Carried Out.
    [Our Newspaper] The preparation work for land reform in the southern and northern Anhui areas is about to be completed. After the liberation of the entire southern Anhui area, through the work of suppressing bandits, combating local bullies, reducing rent, and providing disaster relief, the organization of farmers' associations has greatly developed. According to statistics, there are already more than 1.1 million members of farmers' associations and 78,000 militia members in the area. In order to further rectify the peasant ranks, each county began running training classes for village cadre activists in early August. Generally, each session lasted half a month, with two sessions of concentrated training; it was completed by the end of September. During the study period, based on the land reform policy and the specific local conditions, and through repeated discussions and timely answers to questions from leaders, the trainees gained a further understanding of the necessity and justice of land reform and various specific policies, dispelling ideological problems among some trainees, such as the idea that "there would be no land to distribute without touching the rich peasants." As of September 20, each county had trained more than 13,000 village cadres; before land reform, the entire area could train 20,000 people.

    The training of cadres above the district level began in July. General district cadres were trained by the prefectural party committee's party school; key county and district cadres were trained by the regional party committee's party school. The content of the study was mainly the land reform policy, combined with rectifying the ideology and work style of cadres. As of now, in addition to the regional party committee's party school having already trained two sessions of 593 cadres, the prefectural party committee's party schools have also trained one to two sessions, training a total of more than 4,000 cadres. The entire region's cadre training concluded in early October.

    After this rectification and land reform study, the cadres' class consciousness, policy understanding, and ideological level have improved a step further. Some of the past bureaucratic and commandist work styles have undergone great changes. Some new cadres from landlord backgrounds, due to the improvement of their ideological awareness, have also expressed their firm support for land reform and their commitment to working for the interests of the broad masses of peasants.

    During the summer vacation, various localities organized summer lecture meetings, teacher training classes, summer schools, etc., respectively concentrating more than 5,300 primary school teachers and more than 4,000 young students from secondary schools and above to study the land reform policy. In addition, more than 4,000 young students in rural areas also organized study groups, studied the land reform policy, and cooperated with local district and village cadres to carry out land reform propaganda work.

    In order to determine the work plan and specific implementation methods for land reform in the southern Anhui area, the first session of the People's Representatives Conference of all circles in the southern Anhui area was convened on August 18. At the meeting, after repeated discussions and consultations among representatives from all walks of life, the conference unanimously adopted the report by Ma Tianshui, Secretary of the CPC Southern Anhui Regional Committee, entitled "Strive to Complete Land Reform in the Southern Anhui Area" as the resolution of the conference. In order to universally implement the resolution and spirit of this conference, each county convened People's Representatives Conferences and Peasant Representatives Conferences in mid-September. After the county-level representatives conferences and peasant representatives conferences concluded, the district and village levels will universally convene peasant representatives conferences to implement this resolution.

    In order to gain experience, educate cadres, and better carry out land reform work in the entire area, the southern Anhui area conducted pilot land reform experiments in 32 villages from early August, which were all completed by the end of September.

    The preparatory work for land reform in the southern Anhui area is about to be completed. In early October, work teams went to the countryside to carry out land reform work in conjunction with the autumn grain collection. It is expected that the land reform work of 500 villages in the entire area will be completed before the end of November. The first phase of the land reform work team consists of 4,000 people. Now, the directly affiliated agencies of the regional party committee have extracted 305 on-the-job cadres, who began concentrated study on September 18. Each sub-district and county is planning to transfer cadres. In order to ensure the smooth progress of land reform work, the local armed forces of the Southern Anhui Military Region, in addition to actively carrying out the work of eliminating remnant bandits, have also decided to extract 370 troop cadres to form work teams with local cadres in early October to participate in land reform work in the countryside. When the land reform is fully launched, there will be 10,000 staff members participating in land reform work in the entire area. We strive to complete this land reform movement of great historical significance before March of next year.

    Northern Anhui will implement land reform this winter and next spring in 25 counties in the four special districts of Chaohu, Lu'an, Chuxian, and Anqing, south of the Huai River. At present, various preparatory works are nearing completion. The ten thousand plus land reform work cadres who have been trained can all be dispatched to the countryside by the end of October. In the past, the peasants in northern Anhui were long subjected to the cruel oppression and exploitation of feudal landlords and eagerly longed for land reform. Based on this demand of the peasants, the People's Representatives Conference of all circles in northern Anhui discussed in detail the specific implementation methods of land reform in northern Anhui, adopted the report by Li Shinong, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Northern Anhui Regional Committee, on the "Land Reform Tasks for this Winter and Next Spring," and established a Land Reform Committee; and it was adopted by the Northern Anhui Administrative Office and submitted to the East China Military and Political Committee for approval and promulgation. This winter and next spring, the area for land reform in the region covers 25 counties, 195 districts, and 2,524 townships, with a population of over 8 million. The majority of these areas are newly liberated areas. Over the past year, through disaster relief, repairing embankments and preventing floods, suppressing bandits, combating local bullies, and reducing rent, the peasant movement has greatly improved peasant awareness. Farmers' associations have been universally organized in the countryside, with approximately 1.8 million members currently. Since the adoption of the land reform plan, the Northern Anhui People's Administrative Office, the CPC Northern Anhui Committee, and each special district have actively carried out preparatory work. The preparatory committee of the Northern Anhui Farmers' Association and each special district have organized work teams to conduct typical investigation and research work in 22 villages in 14 counties in conjunction with production, disaster relief, and famine preparedness, and then immediately carried out typical experiments. Various localities have also convened peasant representative conferences and party representative conferences one after another to discuss land reform work. At present, the Northern Anhui Party School, the Communist Youth League School, the Administrative Cadre School, and the training classes in each special district have trained more than 10,000 cadres. To supplement the shortage of cadres, the four special districts have also trained 13,500 peasant activists. During the study, the cadres' ideology and work style were rectified, and they fully studied the Land Reform Law and relevant land reform policies. The local party committees also convened cadre meetings, rectified the cadres' ideology and work style through rectification and inspection, and conducted land reform policy education. In addition, the Northern Anhui People's Court is actively training cadres for the people's courts in order to effectively suppress the destructive activities of illegal landlords. In order to lead the farmers' associations at all levels to complete this great land reform movement in a planned and step-by-step manner, Northern Anhui is convening the first session of the Farmers' Representatives Conference to elect members of the Farmers' Association and establish farmers' associations.

　　皖南、皖北两地区
    土改准备工作将全部完成
    整顿农会、训练干部、典型试验等工作均已进行。
    【本报讯】皖南、皖北两区土地改革准备工作即将全部完成。皖南全区解放后，经过剿匪、反霸、减租、生产救灾等工作，农会组织有很大发展，据统计，该区已有农会会员一百一十余万，民兵队员七万八千余名。为了进一步整顿农民队伍，自八月初各县均开办了村干部积极分子训练班。一般是以半个月为一期，分两期集中训练；九月底已训练完毕。在学习期间，根据土地改革政策与当地具体情况，经过反复讨论及领导上及时解答问题，受训学员对土地改革的必要性、正义性及各种具体政策，有了进一步的认识，解除了某些学员认为“不动富农就无田可分”等思想问题。至九月二十日止，各县已训练村干部一万三千余名；在土地改革前，全区可训练两万人。
    区以上干部的训练从七月份开始。区一般干部由地委党校训练；县、区主要干部由区党委党校训练。学习内容是以土地改革政策为主，结合整顿干部思想作风。至目前为止，除区党委党校已经训练两期干部五百九十三名外，各地委党校亦训练了一期至二期，训练干部共四千余名。全区的干部训练于十月初全部结束。
    干部经过这次整风与土改学习以后，阶级觉悟与政策、思想水平均提高了一步。过去的某些官僚主义与命令主义作风，有了很大转变。有些地主出身的新干部，因思想觉悟的提高，也纷纷表示坚决拥护土地改革，为广大农民的利益而努力。
    在暑假期间，各地均组织了暑期讲习会，教师训练班、暑期学园等，分别集中小学校教员五千三百余名及中等学校以上的青年学生四千余名，进行了土地改革政策的学习。另外有四千余名青年学生在农村中也组织了学习小组，学习了土地改革政策，并配合当地区、村干部进行了土地改革宣传工作。
    为了确定皖南区土地改革的工作计划与具体实施办法，八月十八日皖南区召开了第一届各界人民代表会。会上，经过各界人民代表反复讨论、协商，最后一致通过了中共皖南区党委书记马天水关于“为完成皖南区土地改革而奋斗》的报告，作为大会决议。为普遍贯彻这次大会的决议和精神，九月中旬各县均召开了各界人民代表会和农民代表会。县各界代表会与农民代表会结束以后，区、村将普遍召开农民代表会贯彻这一决议。
    为了吸取经验，教育干部，更好地在全区进行土地改革工作，从八月初，皖南区进行了三十二个村的土改典型试验，九月底已全部结束。
    皖南区土地改革准备工作即将全部完成。十月初工作队下乡结合秋征进行土改工作。预计在十一月底以前全区完成五百个村庄的土地改革工作。第一期土改工作队计四千人。现在，区党委直属机关已抽出在职干部三百零五名，于九月十八日开始集中学习。各分区、县正在计划抽调干部。为保证土地改革工作的顺利进行，皖南军区各地方武装，除积极开展肃清残匪工作外，并决定抽出部队干部三百七十名，于十月初与各地方干部共同组成工作队下乡参加土地改革工作。土地改革全面开始时，全区将有一万名工作人员参加土改工作。争取在明年三月以前全部完成这一有伟大历史意义的土地改革运动。
    皖北将于今冬明春在淮河以南的巢湖、六安、滁县、安庆四个专区二十五个县内实行土地改革。现各项准备工作已接近完成。所训练的万余土地改革工作干部，于十月底可全部分发下乡。皖北区农民过去长期处在封建地主的残酷压榨剥削下，热切渴望土地改革。根据农民这一要求，皖北区各界人民代表会议曾详尽讨论了皖北区具体实施土地改革办法，通过了中共皖北区党委李世农副书记关于《今冬明春土地改革任务》的报告，并成立土地改革委员会；且经皖北行政公署采纳呈请华东军政委员会批准公布。该区今冬明春进行土地改革地区计有二十五个县、一百九十五个区、二千五百二十四个乡，人口达八百余万。这些地区中，绝大部分是新解放区。一年多来经过生产救灾、修堤防汛、剿匪、反霸、减租的农民运动，农民觉悟大大提高，乡村已普遍组织起农民协会，目前共有农会会员约一百八十万人。上述地区自通过实行土地改革计划后，皖北区人民行政公署与中共皖北党委及各专区即积极进行准备工作。皖北区农民协会筹委会及各专区均组织了工作队，结合生产救灾备荒等工作，在十四个县二十二个乡村内进行了典型调查研究工作，并紧接着进行了典型试验。各地并先后召开了农代会、党代会，讨论土地改革工作。现皖北党校、团校、行政干部学校及各专区的训练班已共训练了一万余名干部。为补助干部之不足，四个专区并训练农民积极分子一万三千五百人。学习中整顿了思想作风，并充分学习了土地改革法和有关土地改革的政策。各地委也召开了干部会议，通过整风检查工作，整顿干部思想作风，并进行土地改革政策教育。另外皖北人民法院为有效镇压不法地主的破坏活动，正积极训练人民法庭的干部。为有计划有步骤地领导各级农会完成这一伟大土地改革运动，皖北区正召开首届农民代表大会，选举农协委员，成立农民协会。
