After refusing to issue entry visas to representatives from the Soviet Union, China, India and other countries who were invited to attend the celebrations, the Ceylon government on September 28th ordered Mick Bennett, the representative of the World Federation of Trade Unions, who had just arrived in Ceylon holding a British passport, to leave the country within 24 hours. The people of Ceylon have universally expressed anger at this unreasonable behavior by the government, and trade unions and other organizations are organizing a series of protests.
