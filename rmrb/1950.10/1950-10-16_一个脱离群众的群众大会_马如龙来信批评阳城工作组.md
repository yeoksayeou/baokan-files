　　A Mass Meeting Detached from the Masses
    Ma Rulong's Letter Criticizing the Yangcheng Work Group Editor Comrades:
    The work group led by Section Chief Li of the Public Security Bureau of Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, was carrying out the work of banning the Yiguandao [a religious sect] in Shuicun Village, in the first district of the county. They convened a mass meeting detached from the masses at an inappropriate time. The situation was as follows:
    Most villages in the first, second, and seventh districts of the county had not had significant rain since the summer harvest, and the drought was very serious. The masses were worried about getting through the famine. Fortunately, there was a general welcome rain on September 18th and 19th, which greatly boosted the masses' enthusiasm for production. After the rain cleared, the villages began to accumulate fertilizer, deliver manure, harvest late autumn crops, and prepare wheat fields. The Shuicun work group, however, called a village-wide mass meeting under these circumstances (five days after the rain). That morning, after breakfast, I passed by the village and heard bugles and broadcasts. At 11:00 AM, the villagers gathered at the temple. The village chief spoke, and Section Chief Li spoke. It is said that several leaders of the sect confessed and "removed their hats" [renounced their affiliation] at the end (at which point I left). At the time, I asked a comrade with a bugle, "How many people are at the meeting?" He said, "More than 200 are members of the sect, and more than 100 are from the masses." He also said, "Those who don't come today will have to make it up tomorrow."
    During the tense three autumn [autumn harvest] campaign, and after the rain cleared, the masses' demand was to quickly repair the wheat fields and plant the wheat well. But the work group ignored the masses' demands and convened a mass meeting at this time. How could the masses be satisfied?
    At the meeting, Section Chief Li asked me to offer my opinion. I felt that the meeting was already unstoppable, so I could only suggest that the time be short and that the meeting should also mobilize the masses to soak seeds.
    I believe that this kind of work style, detached from the masses, should be corrected.

　　一个脱离群众的群众大会
    马如龙来信批评阳城工作组编者同志：
    山西阳城县公安局李股长所领导的工作组，在该县一区水村做取缔一贯道的工作时，竟在不适当的时候召开了一个脱离群众的群众大会，经过情形是这样的：
    该县一、二、七区大部村庄自夏收以后，未落透雨，旱灾非常严重，群众耽心难以度过灾荒。喜得九月十八、十九日普降喜雨，大大鼓舞了群众的生产情绪。雨后天晴，各村展开了积肥、送粪、收晚秋、整理麦地等工作。水村工作组，偏偏在这种情况下（雨后的第五天），召开了全村群众大会。这天早饭后，我路过该村，听见又吹号、又广播。上午十一点钟，村里的人集合到庙上。村长讲话，李股长讲话，据说最后是几个道头坦白，摘帽子（这时我走了）。当时我问了一个拿军号的同志：“开会的人有多少？”他说：“在道的二百多，群众有一百多。”还说：“今天不来的明天还得补。”
    紧张的三秋运动，又是雨后天晴，群众的要求是抓紧修理麦田，把麦子种好。但工作组不管群众的要求，竟拣这时候召开群众大会，群众怎样会满意呢？
    开会时，李股长让我参加意见。我当时觉得开会的事情，已经阻止不住了，只好提出时间要短，会上把浸种工作向群众动员一下。
    我认为像这样脱离群众的工作作风，是应当纠正的。
