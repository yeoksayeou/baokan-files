Some party member cadres, after the basic victory of the great revolution of our people, have more or less developed a complacent and arrogant attitude, considering themselves veterans. In their work, they are concerned with personal status and treatment, act like old timers, look down on new party members and new cadres, look down on non-party members, and also look down on the people. They are not eager to learn, do not seek progress, and even seek personal enjoyment, heading towards the path of corruption and degeneration; some have even developed to the point of seriously violating party discipline and the laws of the People's Government, completely losing their original revolutionary nature. Although this phenomenon is isolated among our Communist Party cadres, it is still a dangerous phenomenon, and if it is allowed to develop, it will cause undue serious damage to the people's cause. Revolutionaries of the old era, after success, often became licentious, arrogant, and even corrupt and degenerate, becoming obstacles to revolution and social development; however, this situation is absolutely not allowed for our Communist Party. Because we are the vanguard of the proletariat armed with Marxism-Leninism, aiming to liberate all mankind, with a high degree of political consciousness and strict discipline, and mastering the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, which no old-style revolutionary possessed or could possess. Therefore, only we will not repeat the mistakes of history. In times of victory and success, we are always constantly vigilant and constantly strive to overcome all tendencies of pride, complacency, corruption, and degeneration, and maintain the purity of the Party.

As early as September 7, 1937, Comrade Mao Zedong, in his article "Combat Liberalism," criticized the bad tendency of some party member cadres who "think they have contributed to the revolution, act like old timers, can't do big things, don't do small things, are casual in their work, and slack in their studies." In the report of the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of our Party, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that it is necessary to "overcome the complacent and arrogant mood of considering oneself a veteran" in the rectification movement, which is practical and entirely necessary. Stalin said in "Concerning Questions of Leninism": "It is precisely at the present time, in a period of high political activity of the masses, that it is very appropriate to point out these dangers," because "at this time, the danger of pride is one of the most serious dangers encountered by the Party in correctly leading the masses." What Stalin said is completely applicable to us today.

The revolution of the Chinese people has experienced a long and arduous road. In the long revolutionary struggle, countless heroic martyrs of the people threw their heads and shed hot blood, gloriously sacrificing themselves. The Chinese people will always mourn them, learn from them, and their heroic names will be immortal. And the millions of Communist Party members and tens of thousands of cadres who are still alive today have also suffered all kinds of hardships, emerging from death to liberate our great motherland from the dark hell. In the hearts of the people, they are all glorious, worthy of respect, and meritorious. This should be affirmed. But as revolutionaries, as representatives of the broad masses of the people, especially as the most conscious and most advanced Communists of the working class, how should we recognize the origin of this great achievement of the revolution?

Obviously, the reason why the Chinese revolution can have such great achievements is due to the correct leadership of our Party Central Committee, due to Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant achievements in applying the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism to the practice of the Chinese revolution, due to the bloody and hard fighting of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, due to the united efforts of various revolutionary classes and various democratic parties in China, and due to the vanguard and exemplary role of Chinese Communists; but all of this, in the final analysis, is the crystallization of the great power of the Chinese people. If the Chinese people had not worked diligently in deep suffering, contributed their labor, resources, and money to support the revolutionary war, and waged heroic and moving life-and-death struggles under the iron hooves of the enemy, then all victories would have been unimaginable. Therefore, all our achievements come from the people, and everything should be attributed to the people. Some comrades say, "The world was won by us," which is to obliterate the merits of the people and only see one's own merits. In fact, no minority or individual can win the world alone. If someone thinks that they are great and can win the world without the masses of the people, then they are extremely stupid, arrogant, and ridiculous. Therefore, the idea of ​​greed for merit and claiming credit, as the ancient saying goes, "greed for the merit of heaven and take it as one's own strength," is not only wrong but also shameful. If our party member cadres regard the merits of the people and the collective as the merits of a few people or individuals, and thus become arrogant towards the people, the government, and the party, and are unreasonable, then are such people still worthy of respect? Such people not only abandon all the merits they may have had in the past, writing them off completely; but also prove that their level of consciousness was originally very low, and there was originally nothing worthy of respect.

People cannot remember the merits of those who are proud and claim credit. Such people have nothing to say about their merits; only those who truly have merits, are eager to learn, and strive for progress will the people remember their merits and respect them. Comrade Stalin said in his speech at the First All-Union Congress of Collective Farm Shock Workers on February 19, 1933: "It should be remembered that it is not pride but humility that adds glory to the Bolsheviks." Comrade Mao Zedong also said in his speech at the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Labor Model Conference on January 10, 1945: "You have many advantages and great merits, but remember that you must not be arrogant." Now some of our comrades who are proud and claim credit just don't understand the advice of Stalin and Mao Zedong, and say everywhere, "If there is no merit, there is hard work," thinking that the people and the party owe them something, and are everywhere demanding status, care, and rewards, simply losing the flavor of a Communist Party member and a revolutionary. Comrades who have developed this kind of thinking should conduct a profound examination in the rectification movement and completely overcome this extremely harmful thinking. It should be recognized that with this incorrect thinking, various errors and deviations will inevitably occur, which will seriously separate them from the masses, until they are ruined and cannot be saved.

The source of the mood of pride and claiming credit is due to the selfishness and self-interest of the petty bourgeoisie, putting personal interests first and revolutionary interests second. Comrade Mao Zedong said in his report at the Enlarged Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the CPC in November 1938: "Communists should never put personal interests first at any time or place. Personal interests should be subordinate to the interests of the nation and the masses. Therefore, selfishness, passive laziness, corruption, and showiness are the most despicable." All the excuses of those who are proud and claim credit are absurd. Even in terms of the so-called "status," "care," and "rewards," the people, the government, and the party have already given Communist Party cadres and all revolutionary workers who have made some contributions a certain status, a certain degree of care, and rewards. Isn't that a fact? In recent years, due to the nationwide victory and the needs of work development, many places have promoted a large number of new cadres; old cadres have also been generally promoted. Being a cadre in the people's revolutionary cause and being respected by the people is already the supreme glorious reward for a revolutionary. However, even among the cadres who have been promoted, there are still some who do not know how to work diligently and conscientiously, but are still full of complaints, or complain that the superior has not given enough care to their "old qualifications," only hating that their status is not as good as others, but not asking whether their talent, virtue, and work achievements are better than others; or they occupy a fairly high position, but are irresponsible, just strutting around and being arrogant. These people think they are old qualifications, some of whom call themselves "March 8th style" party members because they joined the party around 1938. But, may I ask, what old qualifications are "March 8th style"? Aren't there many who are more qualified than "March 8th style"? What reason is there to be proud of? A Communist Party member acting like an old timer is an insult to the glorious title of Communist Party member; a truly good Communist Party member does not act like an old timer. In the past, some local organizations have given too much undue consideration to the qualifications of cadres, and in the future, there should be no more non-principled consideration in this regard.

The vast majority of our cadres have been tested by long-term revolutionary struggles. Practice has proved that they are loyal to the cause of the people, which is the quality and virtue that revolutionary cadres must possess. With this revolutionary "virtue," we can win the support of the masses of the people. Therefore, such cadres are also qualified in the masses of the people. And this kind of qualification is by no means the so-called "qualification." This kind of qualification comes with the revolutionary "virtue." "Virtue" is the primary condition for cadres. Without this revolutionary "virtue," any talent will be useless to the people's cause. Is it permissible to entrust the people's cause to an unreliable person who is not loyal to the people's cause? Of course, if cadres lack talent or their talent is insufficient to be competent, they will not be able to complete the tasks entrusted to them by the people. Therefore, all revolutionary cadres must always humbly learn and strive to improve themselves so that they can be competent for all arduous tasks. Therefore, we must resolutely oppose the complacent and arrogant mood of considering ourselves as meritorious officials. Those who are proud, claim credit, and act like old timers are shameful because they are only playing with their "qualifications," as if they want to turn themselves into a special person who lives solely on qualifications. However, in the revolutionary ranks, in the people's cause, there has never been and cannot be such a special person who lives solely on qualifications. Because such a person only cares about his personal status, treatment, rewards, etc., he fundamentally loses the revolutionary "virtue" of being loyal to serving the people, and his so-called "qualification" itself is worthless.

Every party member cadre and every revolutionary did not come for status, treatment, rewards, etc. Our outlook on life is to serve the people wholeheartedly, to be the servants of the people, and to be long-term workers for the people. Our purpose is to transform society and transform the world. This is our lifelong career, and this career has no end. Our party has gone through nearly 30 years of revolutionary struggle and led the Chinese people to achieve today's victory. This should be said to be remarkable, but Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" that "we have only done one thing," "the past work is only like completing the first step of a long march of ten thousand miles." There are still many things we should do. Comparing what has been done and what should be done but has not yet been done, we should only make us more energetic to serve the people, continue to promote the revolutionary struggle and national construction work, and move forward bravely on the road of the Long March of ten thousand miles. The past struggle was long and arduous, and the future struggle will still be long and arduous. We must adhere to long-term arduous struggle in order to gradually realize the great goal of transforming society and transforming the world. Some comrades complain, "We are destined to suffer, and others are destined to enjoy happiness." This completely loses the great mind of a Communist Party cadre serving the people, and only cares about personal enjoyment, becoming a vulgar petty person with a short-sighted vision. As Communist Party cadres, we should have great revolutionary ideals and a high degree of political consciousness. We are determined to sacrifice everything for the revolutionary cause and fight to the end. Our purpose is for the liberation and happy life of the people of our country and all mankind. The happiness of the vast majority of the people is also our greatest happiness and greatest joy. It is our willingness to suffer for the people and for the revolution. This is our great glory. What is there to complain about? Moreover, when the people's lives gradually move towards happiness, the working conditions of revolutionary work and the living conditions of revolutionary work cadres will naturally gradually improve. People who complain because of suffering only prove that they are not yet a truly loyal revolutionary to the people's cause, and this should be ashamed of. True revolutionaries, especially Communist Party cadres, should serve as long-term workers for the people for life and be at ease and without complaint. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists": "To sacrifice oneself for the cause of the party, the class, national liberation, and human liberation, even to sacrifice one's life, without hesitation, even feeling happy, this is the highest expression of communist morality, this is the highest expression of the principled nature of party members, this is the pure expression of the proletarian consciousness of Communist Party members." This is the norm that every one of our party member cadres should strictly demand of themselves and practice. The reason why our many martyrs are immortal is because they have realized this highest revolutionary morality. We should firmly remember what Comrade Mao Zedong said in his report at the Seventh National Congress of our Party: "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the interests of the people, making us living people feel sad when we think of them. Do we still have any personal interests or mistakes and shortcomings that we cannot sacrifice?"

Our party member cadres must not only be able to withstand the test in arduous, difficult, and even failed revolutionary struggles, but also be able to withstand the test in smooth, successful, and victorious revolutionary struggles, and must never be dizzy with victory or become proud and claim credit because of victory. We must highly promote our infinite loyalty to the great revolutionary cause and our selfless spirit of serving the people to completely defeat the complacent and arrogant mood of considering ourselves as meritorious officials that exists in some party member cadres.

### 克服以功臣自居的骄傲自满情绪

　　克服以功臣自居的骄傲自满情绪
    我们党的某些党员干部，在我国人民大革命取得基本胜利之后，或多或少地滋长着一种以功臣自居的骄傲自满情绪。他们在工作中计较个人地位和待遇，摆老资格，看不起新党员和新干部，看不起党外人士，也看不起人民群众。他们不虚心学习，不求进步，甚至于贪图个人享乐，走向腐化堕落的道路；有的更发展到违犯党的纪律和人民政府法令的严重地步，完全失去他原有的革命性。这种现象在我们共产党员干部中，虽然是个别的，但仍然是危险的现象，如果任其发展下去，会使人民的事业受到不应有的严重损害。旧时代的革命者，在成功之后，往往放肆、骄傲，以至腐化堕落，成为革命和社会发展的障碍物；但是，这种情形，对于我们共产党来说，是无论如何不能容许的。因为我们是由马列主义武装起来的无产阶级的先锋队，以解放全人类为目的，具有高度的政治觉悟和严格的纪律，掌握着批评与自我批评的武器，为任何旧式革命者所没有也不能有的。因此，只有我们不会重蹈历史的覆辙，我们在胜利和成功的时候，总是不断警惕并不断努力克服一切骄傲自满和腐化堕落的倾向，保持党的纯洁性。
    远在一九三七年九月七日，毛泽东同志在“反对自由主义”一文中，就已经批评了有些党员干部“自以为对革命有功，摆老资格，大事做不来，小事又不做，工作随便，学习松懈”这一种恶劣倾向。在我们党的七届三中全会的报告中，毛泽东同志又指出要在整风运动中“克服以功臣自居的骄傲自满情绪”，这是切合实际的和完全必要的。斯大林在“论列宁主义的几个问题”一文中说过：“正是在现今这个时候，在群众的政治积极性高涨时期，指出这些危险是很适宜的”，因为“此时骄傲的危险，是党在正确领导群众方面所遇到的最严重危险之一”。斯大林所说的话，对今天的我们完全适用。
    我国人民的革命，经历了长期艰难曲折的道路。在长期的革命斗争中，无数人民的英雄烈士，抛掷头颅，洒干热血，光荣地牺牲了。中国人民永远地悼念着他们，学习着他们，他们的英名是永垂不朽的。而今天仍然健在的数百万共产党员和成千成万的干部，很多也都受尽了千辛万苦，出死入生，使我们伟大的祖国从黑暗的地狱中解放出来。在人民的心目中，他们都是光荣的，都是值得尊敬的，都是有功的。这是应该肯定的。但是，作为革命者，作为广大人民的代表者，特别是作为工人阶级中最觉悟最先进的共产党员，我们应该怎样认识这个革命的伟大功绩的由来呢？
    很显然的，中国革命所以能够有这样伟大的功绩，是由于我们党中央的正确领导，是由于毛泽东同志把马列主义的普遍真理运用到中国革命实践中的光辉成就，是由于中国人民解放军的流血苦战，是由于中国各个革命阶级、各个民主党派的团结努力，是由于中国共产党员的先锋模范作用；但是这一切，归根结底，无一不是中国人民伟大力量的结晶。假若没有中国人民在深重的苦难中辛勤地劳动，出人出力出钱来支援革命战争，以及挣扎在敌人的铁蹄下进行了可歌可泣的生死搏斗，那末，一切胜利就都成为不可想像的了。因此，我们的一切功绩都由人民而来，一切都应该归功于人民。有的同志说“天下是我们打下来的”，这就是把人民的功劳抹杀了，只看见自己的功劳。事实上任何少数人或个人都不能包打天下，如果有人以为自己了不起，可以不要人民群众就能把天下打下来，那就是极端愚蠢、狂妄和可笑的了。因此，贪功和居功的思想，如同古语所说“贪天之功，以为己力”，不但是错误的，而且是可耻的。我们的党员干部如果把人民的功劳、集体的功劳，当做少数人或个人的功劳，因而对人民、对政府、对党骄傲起来，蛮不讲理，这样的人那里还值得尊敬呢？这样的人不但把他自己过去即便有的一些功劳全部毁弃，一笔勾销；而且证明他自己的觉悟程度本来很低，本来没有什么值得尊敬的地方。
    凡是骄傲居功的人，人民就不能记他的功劳，这样的人也就没有什么功劳可说；确实有功劳，自己又虚心学习，努力进步的人，人民才会记得他的功劳，才会尊敬他。斯大林同志在一九三三年二月十九日第一次全苏联集体农庄突击队员代表大会上的演说中说过：“应当记着：使布尔什维克增光的，不是骄傲，而是谦逊。”毛泽东同志在一九四五年一月十日陕甘宁边区劳模大会上的讲话中也说过：“你们有许多好处，有很大功劳，但是你们切记不可骄傲。”现在我们有些骄傲居功的同志恰恰不了解斯大林和毛泽东同志的忠告，到处说什么“没有功劳有苦劳”，自以为人民和党对不起他，处处闹地位、要照顾、要报酬，简直失去了共产党员和革命者的气味。滋长了这种思想的同志，在整风运动中应该深刻地进行检讨，彻底克服这种极端有害的思想。应该认识：有了这种不正确的思想，就不可避免地会发生各种各样的错误和偏向，就会严重地脱离群众，一直到身败名裂不可收拾。
    骄傲居功情绪的来源是由于小资产阶级的自私自利性，以个人利益放在第一位，把革命利益放在第二位。毛泽东同志在一九三八年十一月中共扩大的六届六中全会的报告中说：“共产党员无论何时何地都不应以个人利益放在第一位，个人利益应服从于民族的与群众的利益。因此，自私自利，消极怠工，贪污腐化，风头主义等等，是最可鄙的。”骄傲居功者的一切借口都是无稽的，即便就所谓“地位”、“照顾”和“报酬”等等来说，那末，对于共产党员干部和有一点功劳的一切革命工作者，人民、政府和党，也都早已给予了他们以一定的地位，给以一定的照顾和报酬了。这难道不是事实吗？近年来由于全国范围的胜利和工作发展的需要，许多地方都提拔了大批新干部；老干部也都普遍地提拔了。在人民革命事业中当了干部，受到人民的尊敬，这对于一个革命者来说，已经是无上光荣的报酬了。但是，就在被提拔了的干部中，竟然还有些人不知兢兢业业努力工作，仍然满腹牢骚，或者埋怨上级对他的“老资格”照顾不够，只嫌自己的地位不如别人，而不问自己的才德和工作成绩是否胜过别人；或者占据了相当高的地位，不负责任，只是趾高气扬，盛气凌人。这些人自以为是老资格，其中有的自称为“三八式”的党员，因为他们是一九三八年前后入党的。但是，请问“三八式”算得什么老资格呢？比“三八式”更加老资格的不是也很多吗？这又有什么值得骄傲的理由呢？共产党员而摆老资格，这对于光荣的共产党员称号乃是一种污辱；真正的好共产党员是不摆老资格的。过去有的地方组织，对于干部的资格已经做了太多的不应当的照顾，今后在这一方面是不应该再有任何非原则的照顾了。
    我们的绝大多数干部是经过长期革命斗争的考验的，实践证明他们对于人民的事业是忠诚的，这是革命干部所必须具备的品质与德行。有了这种革命的“德”，才能够得到人民群众的拥护，因此，这样的干部在人民群众中也才是有资望的。而这种资望决不是所谓“资格”，这种资望是随着革命的“德”而俱来的。“德”是干部的首要条件。如果没有这种革命的“德”，那末，任何才能都将是无益于人民事业的。假设把人民的事业付托给一个对人民事业不忠实的不可靠的人，这难道是可以容许的吗？当然，干部如果缺乏才能或才能不足以胜任，也是不能完成人民所付托的任务的。因此，一切革命干部就一定要时时刻刻虚心学习，努力提高自己，使自己能够胜任一切艰巨的任务。因此，也就一定要坚决反对以功臣自居的骄傲自满情绪。那些骄傲居功摆老资格的人，其所以是可耻的，就因为他仅仅摆弄他的“资格”，似乎他要把自己变成一种特殊的专靠资格生活的人。但是，在革命的队伍中，在人民事业中，从来没有也不可能有这种特殊的专靠资格生活的人的存在。因为这样的人既然只计较他个人的地位、待遇、报酬等等，他就根本丧失了忠诚为人民服务的革命的“德”，他的所谓“资格”本身是无价值的。
    每个党员干部、每个革命者决不是为地位、待遇、报酬等等而来的，我们的人生观是全心全意为人民服务，做人民的勤务员，给人民当长工。我们的目的是改造社会，改造世界。这是我们终身的事业，这事业是没有止境的。我们的党经过了将近三十年的革命斗争，领导中国人民取得了今天的胜利，这应该说是了不起的吧，但是，毛泽东同志在“论人民民主专政”中说“我们仅仅做了一件事”，“过去的工作只不过像万里长征走完了第一步”。我们应该做的事情还多得很，把已经做的和应该做还没有做的事情比较起来，只有使我们更加奋发努力去为人民服务，继续推进革命斗争和国家建设工作，在万里长征的路上勇往直前。过去的斗争是长期的艰苦的，今后的斗争仍然是长期的艰苦的。我们要坚持长期艰苦的斗争，才能一步一步地实现改造社会、改造世界的伟大目的。有的同志埋怨“我们注定吃苦，人家注定享福”。这就完全失掉了共产党员干部为人民服务的伟大胸襟，而只计较个人的享受，变成目光短小的庸俗小人了。我们身为共产党员干部，应有伟大的革命理想和高度的政治觉悟。我们决心为革命事业不顾一切牺牲，奋斗到底，其目的就是为了我国人民和全人类的解放与幸福的生活。最大多数人民的幸福也就是我们最大的幸福和最大的快乐。为人民为革命而吃苦，这是我们所心甘情愿的，这是我们莫大的光荣，有什么可以埋怨的呢？而且，当着人民的生活逐渐走向幸福的时候，革命工作的条件和革命工作干部的生活条件自然也会随着逐渐改善。因为吃苦而埋怨的人，只是证明他自己还不是一个真正忠心于人民事业的革命家，这是应该惭愧的。真正的革命家，特别是共产党员干部，应该终身充当人民的长工而心安理得，毫无怨言。刘少奇同志在“论共产党员的修养”中说过：“为了党的、阶级的、民族解放与人类解放的事业而牺牲个人，以至牺牲自己的生命，而毫不犹豫，以至感觉愉快，这就是最高的共产主义道德的表现，这就是党员最高原则性的表现，这就是共产党员无产阶级意识的纯洁的表现。”这就是我们每一个党员干部应该严格要求自己和身体力行的规范。我们的许多先烈之所以永垂不朽，就因为他们是实现了这个最高的革命道德。毛泽东同志在我们党的第七次全国代表大会的报告中所说的话，我们应该牢牢地记住：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益或错误、缺点，不能牺牲吗？”
    我们的党员干部，不但要在艰苦的困难的甚至于失败的革命斗争中受得起考验，而且要在顺利的成功的胜利的革命斗争中受得起考验，决不可因胜利而冲昏头脑，因胜利而骄傲居功。我们要高度发扬对伟大革命事业的无限忠心和为人民服务的忘我精神，来彻底战胜存在于某些党员干部中的以功臣自居的骄傲自满情绪。
