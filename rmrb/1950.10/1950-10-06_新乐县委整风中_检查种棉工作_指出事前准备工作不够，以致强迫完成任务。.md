Xinle County Committee Rectification:
    Inspecting Cotton Planting Work
    Pointing Out Insufficient Preparatory Work Leading to Forced Completion of Tasks

[This Newspaper Despatches] During the rectification of the Xinle County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province, the leadership of cotton planting work was taken as the focus of inspection and summary. When summarizing and inspecting their work, the County Committee first affirmed the achievements in agricultural production this year, noting the increase in grain and cotton yields and the completion of planting tasks on approximately 90,000 mu of cotton. However, it also pointed out that many serious errors and shortcomings had occurred in the leadership's thinking and actions, manifested as follows:

(1) Regarding the preparatory work for cotton planting, the Prefectural Committee instructed last autumn that the masses should be persuaded to reserve cotton fields when planting wheat. However, the County Committee failed to provide specific leadership, causing the reservation of cotton fields to become laissez-faire, creating unfavorable conditions for cotton planting this year. This spring, the preparation of cotton seeds was also neglected. At the beginning of sowing, there were only 30,000 jin of cotton seeds. Although the supply and marketing cooperative was immediately ordered to prepare 250,000 jin, only 116,000 jin were lent out due to the approaching planting season and other reasons. Moreover, due to the urgency, the quality of the purchased cotton seeds was poor, with a germination rate of only about 60%. The method of delivering cotton seeds to people's doors was used during lending, forming coercion.

(2) In order to complete the cotton planting task, coercive slogans were put forward by any means necessary: "Failure to complete the cotton planting task is an error in the political line." Cadres were only allowed to talk about the favorable conditions for cotton planting and were not allowed to talk about the difficulties. Under these circumstances, the Third District even interpreted not planting cotton as "equal to not resisting Japan." Consequently, a series of commandist actions were generated from top to bottom. For example, a certain branch secretary of the Communist Party in Beiwangsu Village, Fifth District, was detained by the district government for reflection because he said that cotton planting was difficult to complete (they even intended to deprive him of food). He was only released after he admitted and guaranteed the completion of the cotton planting task. As a result, district cadres generally believed that as long as they completed the task, committing a little commandism would not be a big deal; failure to complete the task would be unbearable. Therefore, when the masses raised concerns about poor cotton seeds and incomplete seedling emergence, some cadres threatened the masses by saying they would find typical examples to criticize, and some villagers said, "I'd rather not have the land than say anything." At the same time, the County Committee adopted militarized organizational forms such as shock brigades and teams to carry out crash cotton planting. The masses in Kangxing Village reflected: "Plant cotton! Livestock eats cotton stalks, pigs eat cotton leaves, people eat cotton bolls, and the remaining cotton supports the labor."

(3) In the propaganda work for cotton planting, the autumn cotton requisition was mechanically promoted, and even the erroneous slogan of "Even if you don't plant cotton now, you will still be levied cotton in the autumn" was put forward. The relationship between cotton planting and the vital interests of the masses was not sufficiently publicized. When allocating the acreage for cotton planting, the phenomenon of allocating according to the percentage of land acreage occurred, causing resistance from some of the masses. For example, some villagers in Dongzhang Village said: "If we don't have to pay extra, we will plant cotton. If we are asked to pay extra, we won't plant it. If there is really no way, I will plant it on the river beach." Some of the masses even falsely reported that they had planted cotton when they had clearly planted corn. More seriously, some places even destroyed crops to plant cotton. The County Committee did not stop or correct this phenomenon when it became aware of it. For example, some Party members in Pengjiazhuang destroyed green seedlings to plant cotton in order to play a leading role, but were praised by the County Committee instead. This led to the error of destroying hundreds of mu of green seedlings throughout the county.

In its summary inspection, the County Committee examined the root causes of all the above shortcomings and errors. It was mainly due to the existence of a purely task-oriented viewpoint, which led to commandism. Secondly, there was a lack of foresight regarding the cotton planting task, leading to bureaucratic errors. It was also recognized that these errors had caused immeasurable damage to the Party's prestige among the people.

　　新乐县委整风中
    检查种棉工作
    指出事前准备工作不够，以致强迫完成任务。
    【本报讯】中共河北省新乐县委整风中，以领导种棉工作为检查总结工作的重点。县委在总结检查工作时，首先肯定了今年农业生产的成绩，今年粮棉产量增加，并完成了约九万余亩的植棉任务。并指出，在领导思想和行动上，却发生了很多严重的错误和缺点，表现在：
    （一）在种棉的准备工作上，地委去秋指示，种麦时要说服群众留下棉田，但县委未作具体领导，致使留棉田工作陷于自流，给今年种棉造下不利条件。今年春天又忽视了准备棉籽的工作。播种开始时只有三万斤棉籽。后来虽然立即责成供销社马上准备了二十五万斤，但因播种时期将过，以及其他原因，只贷下去十一万六千斤。而且由于时间仓促，购来棉籽质量不好，贷下去的棉籽发芽律仅百分之六十左右。贷发中又使用了棉籽送上门的办法，形成强迫。
    （二）为完成种棉任务，曾不择手段地提出了强迫命令的口号：“完不成种棉任务就是政治路线的错误”。并且只准干部说种棉的有利条件，不许说种棉的困难。在这种情形下，三区竟把不种棉解释成为“等于不抗日”。因而产生了从上到下一系列的命令主义。如五区北王宿村中共某支委说种棉难于完成任务，就被区上留住在区反省，（甚至打算不叫他吃饭。直到他承认了保证完成种棉任务才被放回。这样一来，一般区干部普遍认为：只要完成任务，犯点命令主义也不算什么，完不成任务可受不了。因此，在棉籽不好，棉苗出不全的情况下，群众提意见时，有的干部就威胁群众说要找典型扣坏帽子，有的村民就说：“宁不要地了，也不要说什么”。同时县委采用突击大队、小队等军事化的组织形式下去突击种棉。康兴村群众反映说：“种棉吧！牲口吃棉花秸，猪吃棉花叶，人吃棉花桃，剩下棉花支了差。”
    （三）在种棉的宣传工作中，机械的宣传了秋后征棉，甚至提出了现在不种棉，秋征时也要征棉花的错误口号。而种棉与群众的切身利益关系如何，则宣传得不够；在分配植棉亩数时，就发生了按地亩的百分比分配的现象，引起部分群众的对抗。如东张村有的村民说：“不要我们拿差，我们就种，叫拿差就不种，实在没法，我到河滩上种去。”有的群众甚至明明是种了玉茭，但假报说是种了棉花。更严重的是有的地方竟毁掉庄稼改种棉花。县委知道了这种现象也没有制止纠正。如彭家庄有的党员为起带头作用，毁了青苗种棉花，反而受到县委的表扬。因而造成了全县毁青苗数百亩的错误。
    县委在总结检查中，检讨出发生以上的一切缺点和错误的根源。主要是由于存在了单纯任务观点，致发生了命令主义。其次，是对种棉任务缺乏预见性，以致发生官僚主义的错误。并认识到，这些错误，使党在人民群众中的威信，受到不可计量的损失。      （韩晓明、王玉璞）
