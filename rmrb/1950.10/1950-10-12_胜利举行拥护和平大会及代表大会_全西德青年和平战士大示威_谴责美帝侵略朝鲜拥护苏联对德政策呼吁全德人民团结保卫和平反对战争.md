Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Despite the West German reactionary authorities' repeated obstruction and cruel suppression, the First Congress of West German Youth Peace Fighters was successfully held on October 8th in Dinslaken, Ruhr area, following the West German Youth Peace Rally on October 1st. According to TASS, 1,500 delegates attended the congress, along with youth representatives from the Netherlands, Sweden, France, East Germany, and the Saar region. The delegates from twenty youth groups took a solemn oath, stating: "We pledge to work tirelessly, calling on all young people to join our struggle for peace, to refuse to take up arms for predatory wars. We protest against the production of weapons, the release of war criminals, and the terror tactics of warmongers."

The delegates' congress also adopted a declaration condemning US imperialism's intervention in Korea, demanding the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, and supporting the Soviet Union's proposals for establishing a unified, democratic Germany, concluding a just peace treaty, and withdrawing occupying forces. The declaration concluded by calling on all German people to unite to defend peace and oppose the attempts by US and British imperialism to force German youth to become cannon fodder. All attendees then held a grand demonstration in the city of Dinslaken.

Prior to this, 200,000 young people in West Germany held the long-planned but repeatedly banned West German Youth Peace Congress on October 1st by organizing over a thousand powerful demonstrations throughout West Germany. According to Dentsu, demonstrators in various locations engaged in heroic struggles against police persecution. Since September 29th, the reactionary authorities had imposed martial law in various locations, with police cars deployed everywhere and carrying out mass arrests, but the masses in various locations still broke through numerous obstacles that day, defying attacks with water cannons and rubber batons, and held marches and demonstrations while chanting slogans such as "You can't ban peace." In Hamburg, on the morning of October 1st, many rooftops were adorned with peace's blue flag. Although police attacked demonstrators, injuring fifty and arresting a hundred, demonstrators regrouped and held a rally in front of the Flora Theatre. Stirring demonstrations were also held in Frankfurt, Dortmund, Nuremberg, Karlsruhe, Fürth, Hanover, Braunschweig, Kassel, Munich, and Lübeck. According to incomplete statistics, around 1,500 demonstrators were arrested by the police.

The large-scale demonstrations by West German Youth Peace Fighters proved the immense upsurge of the West German people's power. The German News Agency stated that extensive and in-depth publicity and organizational work had been carried out throughout West Germany in preparation for this demonstration. On the eve of the demonstration, Hermann, chairman of the German Communist Party and honorary member of the Free German Youth League, pointed out in his letter to the youth: "The Youth Peace Congress is of great importance. Young men and women prove that they do not want to die in the trenches of a third world war, they want to build a new life for themselves and for the German people in a peaceful environment. They make a great contribution to the struggle for peace and for the future of the German nation."

　　胜利举行拥护和平大会及代表大会
    全西德青年和平战士大示威
    谴责美帝侵略朝鲜拥护苏联对德政策呼吁全德人民团结保卫和平反对战争
    【新华社十一日讯】不顾西德反动当局的百般阻挠和残酷镇压，西德青年和平战士第一届代表大会，已继十月一日西德青年拥护和平大会之后，于十月八日在鲁尔区丁斯拉根胜利举行。据塔斯社报道，出席大会的代表有一千五百名，并有荷兰、瑞典、法国、德国东部和萨尔区的青年代表出席。大会代表二十个青年团体举行了庄严宣誓。誓词说：“我们保证进行不懈的工作，号召所有青年参加我们为和平而进行的斗争，使他们拒绝拿起武器进行掠夺性的战争。我们抗议生产武器，抗议释放战犯，抗议战争贩子的恐怖手段。”
    代表大会并通过宣言，谴责美帝国主义干涉朝鲜，要求一切外国军队自朝鲜撤退；拥护苏联关于建立统一的民主德国、缔结公正的和约以及撤退占领军的主张。宣言最后呼吁全体德国人民团结起来，为保卫和平，反对美英帝国主义企图强迫德国青年充当炮灰而斗争。全体与会者并于丁斯拉根市区举行了盛大的示威游行。
    在此以前，西德二十万青年于十月一日以在全西德各地组织一千多起强大示威游行的方式，举行了早就筹备而为反动当局一再禁止的西德青年和平大会。据电通社报道：各地示威群众曾与警察的迫害进行了英勇斗争。自九月二十九日起，反动当局即于各地实行了戒严，警车到处出动并大肆搜捕，但各地群众当日仍冲过重重障碍，不顾水龙与橡皮棍的袭击，在高呼“你们禁止不了和平”的口号声中，举行游行示威。在汉堡，十月一日清晨，许多屋顶即升起了和平的蓝旗，虽然警察向示威者进攻，打伤了五十人，逮捕了一百人，但是示威者仍然再度集合，并在佛罗拉戏院前面举行了大会。在法兰克福，多特蒙特，纽伦堡，卡尔斯卢厄，佛尔特，汉诺威，不伦瑞克，卡塞尔，慕尼黑和卢卑克等地，都举行了动人心魄的示威。据不完全统计，为警察逮捕的示威者竟达一千五百名左右。
    全西德青年和平战士的大示威，证明了西德人民力量的巨大高涨。德意志通讯社称，为了筹备这一示威，全西德各地都进行了广泛深入的宣传和组织工作。自由德国青年联盟名誉盟员德国共产党主席雷曼，在示威前夕发表的告青年书中指出：“青年拥护和平大会是具有巨大重要性的。青年男女证明他们不要在第三次世界大战的战壕中死去，他们要在和平的环境中为他们自己以及为德国人民建设新生活。他们对为和平、为德意志民族的将来而进行的斗争，有着巨大贡献。”
