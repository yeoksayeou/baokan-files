　　The Powerful Worldwide Movement to Defend Peace
    ——Bolshevik Magazine Editorial
  (Part 1)
    Editor's Note: The Second World Peace Congress is scheduled to be held in the United Kingdom from November 13th to 19th. The China Committee for the Defense of World Peace is actively preparing all the procedures for our delegation to participate in the conference and is widely collecting materials on the anti-aggression movement for the defense of peace from various parts of China. During this preparation period, the number of peace signatures in our country has increased dramatically. According to incomplete statistics from various provinces and cities received by the Secretariat of the China and World Peace Congress, as of October 13th, the number of peace signatures nationwide has reached 190,191,794, accounting for 40% of the national population. This achievement fully demonstrates the enthusiastic sentiment of the Chinese people in welcoming the Second World Peace Congress. We are now less than 10 million away from the target of 200 million people.
    The Soviet magazine "Bolshevik" published an editorial in its 16th issue this year to welcome the Second World Peace Congress. This editorial provides a comprehensive summary of the unprecedented scale and strength of the worldwide peace movement since the First Congress was held in April last year and clearly points out the glorious duties and fighting tasks that peace defenders should have under the current international situation. This is an important and instructive article. The subheadings in the text were added by our editors.

    The Second World Peace Congress is about to convene in mid-November. In the powerful movement of people around the world to defend peace, support the prohibition of propaganda for new wars, prohibit the use of atomic weapons, and generally reduce armaments, this congress will become a new milestone. This congress will be a meeting with the broadest representation and an expression of the wishes of all peace-loving humanity. The Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress calls on all political, trade union, cultural, social, and religious groups, as well as women and youth, and all people who yearn for world peace, regardless of political belief or religious motivation, to unite in preparing and carrying out the work of the Peace Congress.

    The upcoming Second World Peace Congress is only about a year and a half away from the First Congress held in Paris and Prague in April 1949. However, in this short period, the movement to defend peace has reached an unprecedented scale. The enthusiastic response to the Stockholm Appeal in every country around the world and among people of all walks of life fully confirms this fact. Hundreds of millions of people of different colors, different nationalities, different political views, religious beliefs, and social status are rising up with overwhelming momentum to demand the prohibition of atomic weapons. The Stockholm Appeal has become a program for the unity of the people of the world in actively fighting to defend peace.

    The Soviet Union's Great Contribution to the Noble Cause

    The great Soviet people, who are building communism, have come to the forefront of the opposition to war. The signature campaign in response to the Stockholm Appeal has truly taken on a nationwide character in the Soviet Union. This is the most powerful symbol of the moral and political unity of Soviet society, the Soviet people's loyalty to their government, their loyalty to the Communist Party, and their loyalty to the great standard-bearer of peace—Comrade Stalin. The signatures of 115 million Soviet citizens in support of the declaration prohibiting the use of atomic weapons once again demonstrate the Soviet people's determination to love peace and their unwavering will to unite and cooperate with the people of all countries. These signatures—the signatures of all adult citizens of the Soviet Union—powerfully prove that there are no exploiting classes or groups in the Soviet Union who intend to launch bloody wars of aggression. It proves that the Soviet people respect the sovereignty and independence of all nations, large and small, and strive for friendly cooperation with the people of all countries. The Soviet people, with their unanimous response to the Stockholm Appeal by signing their names, have shown their sincere support for the Soviet government's and Stalin's peaceful foreign policy. The Soviet Union's signature campaign in response to the Stockholm Appeal is a great contribution to the noble cause of fighting against war, and it shows that the Soviet Union is a loyal and reliable fortress of the world's organized camp for peace.

    Peace Signatures in People's Democratic Countries

    The people's democratic countries carried out the signature campaign in an atmosphere of tremendous political upsurge. Bulgaria received more than 5.8 million signatures, Hungary—7.5 million, Poland—18 million, Romania—over 10 million, and Czechoslovakia—9.5 million. In Korea, 5.68 million signatures were received. In the Mongolian People's Republic, the signatures reached over 680,000. In the People's Republic of China, 85 million signatures have already been received (according to statistics from the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace, the number of signatures had exceeded 190 million as of October 13—translator's note). The countries that have been liberated from imperialist oppression and are now standing in the democratic camp against imperialism have shown their unwavering will to support peace. In capitalist countries, colonies, and oppressed countries, the camp fighting for peace is also booming.

    In less than three months, 330 million people in countries around the world have signed the declaration in response to the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons. Never in history has any appeal received so many signatures.

    The Working Class Struggles to Defend Peace

    New strata of all nationalities are increasingly participating in the organized struggle to defend peace. Trade unions have agreed to actively participate in this struggle. The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions passed a resolution stating that the most important tasks of trade unions are to strengthen the struggle for lasting peace, to stop the arms race, to prohibit the use of atomic weapons, and to support the active mass actions of the working class to defend peace and oppose the preparation of new wars by all means. Many French and German trade unions have recently concluded contracts with each other regarding the joint struggle of the German and French working classes to defend peace. The World Federation of Educational Workers, with three million members who support democracy, recently convened a representative conference and issued a call to defend peace. Countless members of British trade unions, disregarding the policies of reactionary ringleaders, have demanded the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons. The resistance of progressive elements in the American trade union movement to the reactionary imperialist trade union policy is growing. Countless women's and youth organizations, progressive scientists, writers, and artists have united around the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. The Communist Parties of various countries have come to the forefront of the struggle to defend peace.

    Opposing American Aggression Against Korea

    The US military intervention in Korea has further increased the determination of the masses of people to defend the cause of peace. From the time the United States began its war of aggression against Korea to the present, the number of signatures in response to the Stockholm Appeal has greatly increased. Throughout the earth, protests against the American army's bandit-like attack on the Korean people are increasing day by day. "Get out of Korea!"—this is the demand of hundreds of millions of people. People of all nationalities have ignited unparalleled and intense anger against the American interventionists and their lackeys.

    In the Soviet Union, at countless rallies and mass meetings, workers unanimously condemned the foreign aggressors who were waging the war of aggression against the Korean people and demanded that foreign troops withdraw from Korea. The Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union, representing tens of millions of workers and staff, expressed its firm opposition to the American military intervention in Korea, the inhuman bombing of cities and villages, and all the brutal means used by the United States in Korea to carry out large-scale massacres of peaceful residents. The Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee, the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, and the Soviet Academy of Sciences have all submitted protests to the Security Council against the criminal policies of the US government. The entire Soviet social public opinion unanimously condemned the crimes of the American interventionists in Korea.

    The heinous crimes of the American imperialists have also aroused the anger of all good people around the world. The World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and various academic groups have all submitted protests to the Security Council against the United States' bloody adventure policy. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic, the Government of Albania, the National Assembly of Czechoslovakia, the National Committee of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front, and the governments and social organizations of many other countries have all protested against the shameless crimes of American imperialism in Korea. The American ruling clique's dream of using the banner of the United Nations to disguise its military intervention in Korea has been completely shattered. Peace-loving people of all nationalities around the world welcome and support the proposals put forward by the Soviet representative in the Security Council aimed at restoring and consolidating peace in Korea and restoring the legitimate organization of the Security Council. The masses of people around the world unanimously condemned the American occupation of the Security Council and supported the Soviet Union's struggle to ensure that the United Nations truly fulfills its mission of defending peace and international security.

    A Serious Warning to the Imperialist Camp

    People around the world demand peace and are increasingly actively fighting against war instigators. The significance of hundreds of millions of people rising up to wage a resolute and conscious struggle for peace far exceeds the meaning of this struggle itself. The movement to defend peace, which is a serious warning to the imperialist camp, is gaining greater significance.

    The aggressors have torn off their masks. They have gone from preparing for war to open and direct military aggression. Facts repeatedly confirm Comrade Stalin's words: "Imperialism cannot live without violence and plunder, without blood and shooting. This is the nature of imperialism."

    The recently passed statement of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Congress points out:

    "The increasingly deteriorating international situation in recent times has become a direct threat to universal peace and has placed new and more important tasks on all peace advocates than ever before."

    The US ruling clique vainly attempts to use military aggression to prevent the Korean people from fulfilling their historical mission—building a unified and democratic country. When Comrade Stalin exposed those imperialists who were trying to reverse the wheel of history and, for this purpose, brought cannons to the agenda, he wrote: "Only the naive can imagine that the laws of cannons are superior to the laws of history, that shooting can drag the wheel of history backward..."

    The US government's attempt to obstruct a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue has completely exposed it as the organizer of the Korean War and an imperialist aggressor. Moreover, many events prove that American aggression in Korea is only part of the American imperialist aggression plan. American imperialism is interfering in the internal affairs of the people of China, Vietnam, and the Philippines.

    As a result of the American transition to open aggression in Asia, the arms race in the imperialist camp has intensified. More than 76% of the US national budget this year is directly or indirectly used for war preparations. Truman has again requested $15.6 billion from Congress for war adventures. The countries Marshallized are following the United States' war policy and are engaging in an unprecedented arms race. British military spending has increased by more than 40%. The French government has announced a memorandum proposing an additional appropriation of 2,000 billion francs for military expenditures over three years. Belgium's military budget has almost increased by 60%. Denmark, according to the orders of its American master, spends almost half of its entire budget on military expenditures. The Italian government is also following the intentions of American imperialism to expand its army.

    Imperialism attempts to alleviate the impact of the new economic crisis and maintain the excessive profits of monopoly capital by preparing and launching wars. According to official materials, the profits of major American companies in 1950 exceeded the profits of 1949 by at least 17%.

    Accompanied by the militarization of the United States and the Marshallized countries is the ruling group's attempt to place the heavy burden of all military expenditures on the shoulders of the working class and all working people. The American and imperialist ruling groups in capitalist countries completely imitate Hitler's slogan: "Guns instead of butter." Truman openly proposed in a message to Congress to launch a full-scale attack on the living standards of the American working people. He proposed increasing taxes and demanding intensified labor. The American government is trying to deprive workers of the right to strike. The arms race has caused prices of necessities to rise, and the material living conditions of working people are deteriorating.

    More dangerous situations threaten the British working class. In the British government's statement on issuing new government bonds for military purposes, it is openly stated that the increase in military spending "will inevitably slow down the economic recovery of Britain" and "will definitely cause serious sacrifices for the British people."

　　全世界人民的强大的保卫和平运动
    ——布尔什维克杂志社论
  （上）
    编者按：第二次世界保卫和平大会定期十一月十三日至十九日在英国召开。中国保卫世界和平大会工作委员会连日积极筹备我国代表团参加大会的一切手续，并广泛征集中国各地人民保卫和平反对侵略运动的各项资料。在这筹备期间，我国和平签名人数有着飞跃的增加。根据中国和大秘书处所收到的各省市不完全的统计材料，截至十月十三日止，全国和平签名人数已达一亿九千零十九万一千七百九十四人，占全国人口百分之四十。这种成就充分表示出中国人民迎接第二次世界和大的热烈情绪。现在离预定二亿人的目标不到一千万了。
    苏联《布尔什维克》杂志今年第十六期上载有社论一篇，迎接第二次世界保卫和平大会。这篇社论就去年四月举行第一次和大以来，全世界保卫和平运动所获致的空前规模与强大力量，作了全面的总结，并明确指出和平保卫者们在当前国际形势之下，应有的光荣义务和战斗任务。这是一篇有指导性的重要论文。文中插题是本刊编者所加的。
    十一月中旬将要召开第二次世界保卫和平大会。在全世界人民保卫和平、拥护禁止宣传新战争、禁止使用原子武器与普遍裁减军备的强大运动中，这次大会将成为新的里程碑。这次大会将是一个最有广泛代表性的会议，是全体爱好和平的人类的愿望的表达者。世界保卫和平大会常设委员会号召一切政治的、职工会的、文化的、社会的与宗教的团体以及妇女和青年，号召一切渴望世界和平的人们，不问政治信仰与基于何种宗教的动机，一致参加准备与进行保卫和平大会的工作。
    即将到来的第二次世界保卫和平大会距一九四九年四月间在巴黎和布拉格召开的第一次大会为期不过一年半左右。但是，在这一短短的时期里，保卫和平的运动达到了空前的规模。斯德哥尔摩宣言在全世界各个国家里，在各阶层人民中间所取得的热烈响应完全证实了这一事实。不同肤色、不同民族、不同政治观点、宗教信仰与社会地位的亿万人民正以排山倒海之势奋起要求禁止原子武器。斯德哥尔摩宣言已经变成了全世界人民为保卫和平积极斗争而团结一致的纲领了。
    苏联对崇高事业的伟大贡献
    正在建设共产主义的伟大的苏联人民，走到了反对战争的前列。响应斯德哥尔摩宣言的签名运动，在苏联真正取得了全民的性质。这是苏维埃社会的道义上政治上的团结一致，苏联人民忠实于自己的政府，忠实于共产党，忠实于伟大的和平旗手——斯大林同志的最有力的标帜。一亿一千五百万苏联公民签名拥护禁止使用原子武器的宣言，又一次地表明了苏联人民爱好和平的决心及其与各国人民团结合作的不屈不挠的意志。这些签名——苏联所有成年公民的签名——有力的证明了在苏联是没有剥削阶级或存心发动流血的侵略战争的集团的。它证明了苏联人民尊重一切大小民族的主权和独立并力图同各国人民友好合作。苏联人民以万众一心的响应斯德哥尔摩宣言的签名，表明了自己对苏联政府的、斯大林的和平的外交政策的竭诚拥护。苏联的响应斯德哥尔摩宣言的签名运动是对于为反对战争而斗争的崇高事业的伟大贡献，它说明了苏联是世界有组织的拥护和平的阵营的忠实可靠的堡垒。
    和平签名在人民民主国家
    人民民主国家在巨大的政治高涨的气氛中进行了签名运动。在保加利亚收到了五百八十多万签名，匈牙利——七百五十万，波兰——一千八百万，罗马尼亚——超过一千万，捷克——九百五十万。在朝鲜收到了五百六十八万签名。在蒙古人民共和国收到的签名达到六十八万以上。在中华人民共和国已经收到了八千五百万签名（根据中国保卫世界和平大会委员会统计材料截至十月十三日止签名人数已超过一亿九千万人——译音）。从帝国主义的压迫下解放出来的，并在现正站在反对帝国主义的民主阵营的国家，显示了自己的拥护和平的不可摇撼的意志。在资本主义国家，殖民地与被压迫国家里为拥护和平而斗争的阵营也正在蓬勃展开着。
    在不到三个多月的时间里，世界各国已经有三亿三千万人签名响应禁止使用原子武器的宣言。历史上从来没有任何一个呼吁得到过这样多的签名。
    工人阶级为保卫和平而斗争
    各族人民的新的阶层愈来愈多地参加有组织的拥护和平的斗争。工会同意积极地参加这一斗争。世界工联执行委员会通过了决议，确定以加强争取持久和平，争取停止军备竞赛，禁止使用原子武器，用一切方法支持工人阶级为保卫和平反对新战争准备的积极的群众性的行动为工会的最重要的任务。许多法国和德国的工会最近互相订立了关于联合德法两国的工人阶级为保卫和平而斗争的合同。拥有三百万拥护民主的教师会员的世界教育工作者联合会，最近召开了代表会议，发出了保卫和平的号召。无数英国工会会员，不顾反动头子的政策，纷纷要求禁止使用原子武器。美国工会运动中的进步分子对反动的帝国主义工会政策的反抗日益增长着。无数妇女与青年团体，进步的科学家、文学家与艺术家已团结在世界保卫和平大会常设委员会的周围。各国的共产党都走到为保卫和平而斗争的最前列。
    反对美国侵略朝鲜
    由于美国对朝鲜的军事干涉，更加增长了人民群众保卫和平事业的坚定决心。从美国在朝鲜开始了侵略战争到现在的这一期间，响应斯德哥尔摩宣言的签名大大增加了。在整个地球上，反对美国军队强盗式的进攻朝鲜人民的抗议，天天增加着。“滚出朝鲜去！”——这就是千百万人民的要求。各族人民对美国干涉者及其走狗燃起了无比强烈的愤怒。
    在苏联，在无数次集会与群众大会上，劳动者一致斥责进行对朝鲜人民的侵略战争的外国侵略者，并要求外国军队退出朝鲜。全苏总工会中央理事会代表成千万的工人和职员表明坚决反对美国在朝鲜的军事干涉，反对惨无人道的轰炸城市和乡村，反对美国在朝鲜实行的大规模屠杀和平居民的一切惨暴手段。苏联青年反法西斯委员会，苏联妇女反法西斯委员会，苏联科学院都曾向安理会提出了反对美国政府的罪恶政策的抗议。整个苏联的社会舆论一致声讨美国干涉者在朝鲜的罪行。
    美国帝国主义者的滔天罪行同样引起了全世界一切善良的人民的愤怒。世界工联，世界民主妇联，世界民主青年联盟，各个学术团体都向安理会提出了反对美国的血腥冒险政策的抗议。中华人民共和国中央人民政府，蒙古人民共和国政府，阿尔巴尼亚政府，捷克斯洛伐克国民议会，保加利亚祖国阵线民族委员会以及其他许多国家的政府和社会团体都提出了反对美国帝国主义在朝鲜的无耻罪行的抗议。美国统治集团打算扯联合国旗帜来伪装自己在朝鲜的军事干涉的梦想完全被打破了。全世界爱好和平的各族人民都欢迎与拥护苏联代表在安全理事会上所提出的以恢复与巩固朝鲜和平与恢复安理会的合法组织为目的的建议。全世界人民群众一致谴责美国在安理会上的霸占行为，拥护苏联为争取联合国真正完成保卫和平与国际安全的使命而进行的斗争。
    对帝国主义阵营的严重警告
    全世界人民要求和平并日益积极地进行反对战争挑拨者的斗争。成亿的人民奋起为争取和平而进行的坚决的、自觉的斗争的意义是远远超过这一斗争的本身的含义的。成为对帝国主义阵营的严重警告的保卫和平运动日益获得了更大的意义。
    侵略者撕下了假面具。他们从准备战争走上了公开的、直接的军事侵略。事实一次又一次的证实着斯大林同志的话：“帝国主义如果没有暴行和掠夺，没有血和射击是不能活下去的。帝国主义的天性就是这样。”
    最近通过的世界保卫和平大会执行局声明中指出：
    “最近时期愈趋恶化的国际形势，已经变成了对普遍和平的直接威胁，并使全体和平拥护者负起了较之前此任何时候都更为重大的新的任务。”
    美国统治集团妄想以军事侵略阻碍朝鲜人民完成历史的使命——建设一个统一的民主国家。当斯大林同志在揭露那些力图扭转历史的车轮，并为此目的将大炮提到日程上来的帝国主义的时候，他曾经写道：“只有幼稚无知的人才能设想大炮的规律胜过历史的规律，才能设想射击能将历史的车轮拖向后转……。”
    美国政府的极力阻碍和平解决朝鲜问题，彻底暴露了它是朝鲜战争的组织者，是帝国主义的侵略者。不仅如此：许多事件证明美国在朝鲜的侵略，不过是美帝国主义的侵略计划的一部分罢了。美国帝国主义正在干涉中国、越南与菲律宾各国人民的内政。
    美国转变到公开侵略亚洲的结果，加紧了帝国主义阵营的军备竞赛。美国今年国家预算百分之七十六以上直接或间接用于准备战争。杜鲁门向国会又要求一五六亿美元作为战争冒险的经费。马歇尔化国家遵从美国的战争政策，进行着空前的军备竞赛。英国的军费增加了百分之四十以上。法国政府公布了备忘录，提出在三年内发附加拨款二○、○○○亿法郎作军费开支。比利时的军费预算几乎增加了百分之六十。丹麦按照美国主子的命令开支的军费差不多占全部预算的一半。意大利政府也奉行美帝国主义的意旨扩大军队。
    帝国主义企图以准备和发动战争的方法，减轻新的经济危机所带来的打击，保持垄断资本的超额利润。根据官方的材料，美国各大公司一九五○年的利润最低限度超过一九四九年利润的百分之十七。
    伴随着美国与马歇尔化各国的军国主义化而到来的是：统治集团力图将一切军事开支的沉重负担压到工人阶级与一切劳动人民的肩上。美国及其在资本主义国家的帝国主义统治集团完全效法希特勒的口号：“用大炮代替牛油。”杜鲁门在致国会咨文中竟公开提出向美国劳动人民的生活水平实行全面的进攻。他提出增税，要求强化劳动。美国政府力图剥夺工人罢工的权利。军备竞赛造成了生活必需品价格上涨，劳动人民的物质生活状况日益恶化。
    更险恶的情况威胁着英国工人阶级。在英国政府为军事目的增发新公债的声明中公开说出军费的增加“必然会迟缓英国的经济恢复工作”“定将造成英国人民的严重的牺牲”。
