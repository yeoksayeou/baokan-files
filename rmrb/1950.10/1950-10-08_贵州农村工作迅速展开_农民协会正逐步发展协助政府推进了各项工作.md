Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 6th. With the victory in suppressing bandits, rural work in Guizhou Province has greatly developed. Farmers' Associations are gradually being organized. According to incomplete statistics from the suburbs of Guiyang and Zunyi cities, and twenty-two counties including Guizhu and Longli in central Guizhou, Zunyi, Zheng'an, and Meitan in northern Guizhou, Duyun and Danzhai in southern Guizhou, Anshun, Zhenning, and Zhenfeng in western Guizhou, and Tongren in eastern Guizhou, the membership of Farmers' Associations has reached more than 300,000. In villages where Farmers' Associations have been established, the village government structures have been initially transformed. Farmers' Associations and the broad masses of farmers have assisted the People's Government in implementing various rural tasks and decrees. In particular, Farmers' Associations in various counties have played a significant role in assisting the government in suppressing bandits and preventing special agents, and in collecting grain. In the Tongren Special District of eastern Guizhou, the peasant joint defense and self-defense forces under the leadership of the Farmers' Associations have reached 5,600 people, who have defended the rural public security of various counties. The Baojia (protect the home) Team organized by the farmers of Yaxi in Zunyi County, in the past, during tense bandit situations, stood guard day and night for thirteen consecutive days, and repelled harassment by small groups of bandits, protecting the safety of the local people. The Zhenfeng County Farmers' Association in southern Guizhou, assisted the government in investigating 3,500 more dan of grain fields that were being concealed in an attempt to evade burdens during the grain collection work. During the lean season this summer, the Farmers' Associations in various counties also led farmers in clearing out the grain stored in the community granaries. According to statistics from Zunyi, Zheng'an, and Duyun counties, more than 735,000 jin of stored grain held by a few local tyrants and evil gentry was cleared out and lent to poor farmers. Farmers' Associations have also greatly promoted production. For example, in Danzhai County, more than 3,800 mu of wasteland were reclaimed this year; in Anshun and Ningzhen counties, 95% of the fallow land has been cultivated.

　　贵州农村工作迅速展开
    农民协会正逐步发展协助政府推进了各项工作
    【新华社贵阳六日电】随着剿匪胜利，贵州省的农村工作已有很大的开展。农民协会正逐渐组织起来。据贵阳、遵义两市郊区和黔中贵筑、龙里、黔北遵义、正安、湄潭，黔南都匀、丹寨，黔西安顺、镇宁、贞丰，黔东铜仁等二十二县的不完全统计，农民协会的会员已达三十多万人。凡已有农民协会组织的乡村，乡村政权机构即获得了初步的改造，农民协会和广大农民协助人民政府推行了各项农村工作和政令。特别是在协助政府剿匪防特和征粮等工作上，各县农民协会起了重大的作用。黔东铜仁专区各县在农民协会领导下的农民联防自卫武装已达五千六百人，他们拱卫了各县农村的治安。遵义县鸭溪农民组织的保家班，过去曾在匪情紧张时一连十三天不分昼夜地站岗放哨，并曾击溃小股土匪的袭扰，保护了当地人民的安全。黔南贞丰县农民协会，在征粮工作中协助政府查出企图逃避负担的黑地达三千五百多担谷田。今年夏季青黄不接时，各县农民协会并曾领导农民清理义仓积谷。据遵义、正安、都匀三县统计，即清理出为少数土豪劣绅把持的积谷七十三万五千多斤，贷予贫苦农民。农民协会对生产也有很大的推动如丹寨县今年开荒达三千八百多亩；安顺、宁镇两县的熟荒百分之九十五都已垦出。
