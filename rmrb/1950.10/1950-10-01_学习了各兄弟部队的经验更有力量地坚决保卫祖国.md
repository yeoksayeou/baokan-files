Learning from the Experiences of Brotherly Troops Makes Us More Powerful in Resolutely Defending the Motherland
　　Wei Xiaotang, Combat Hero of the Southwest Military Region, Second Field Army
　　Last November, I represented the Second Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. At that time, our troops were carrying out Chairman Mao's and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's orders to advance, and together with the Third and Fourth Field Armies, crossed the Yangtze River, liberated Nanjing and vast areas, declared the demise of the Chiang Kai-shek's petty court, and China saw an unprecedented unification. At the CPPCC meeting, we unanimously adopted the three major documents and established the fundamental law of the Chinese people. On October 1st, our leader, Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government, solemnly announced the establishment of the People's Republic of China here. This was what the Chinese people had hoped for for over a hundred years, and it was also the goal we had strived for arduously for over twenty years. The Chinese people have stood up. As a member of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, I felt unparalleled glory and infinite excitement. At this time, our troops began to advance towards the southwest, carrying out the task of liberating the whole country and eliminating the remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. I rushed back to my unit and conveyed the great gains of the CPPCC to my comrades, who were all extremely excited and unanimously expressed their firm support for the Central People's Government and their determination to eliminate the remaining forces of imperialism and its running dogs in China. Under this encouragement, we liberated all provinces in the southwest except Tibet within fifty-seven days in November and December last year. We also carried out tasks such as collecting grain, suppressing bandits, repairing roads and dikes, and establishing and consolidating people's political power. We also started a new cultural learning movement in the army to build a strong modern national defense force to defend the motherland and safeguard lasting world peace.
　　Today, I have been elected as a combat hero of the Southwest Military Region and have come to the capital to attend the National Combat Heroes Representative Conference. I am even more indescribably happy to participate in the National Day celebration of the first anniversary of the founding of the country here.
　　Now, American imperialism has launched a war of aggression against the Korean people and is constantly carrying out acts of aggression against our country. After hearing about this, all the comrades in me and our Southwest Military Region are filled with indignation. We believe that the Chinese people, who have undergone more than a hundred years of heroic struggle, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which has undergone tens of millions of combat tests for more than twenty years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and under the leadership of the Central People's Government, which is unanimously supported by the whole country, will not tolerate any imperialist aggression. Our responsibility is to accept the instructions of the central leaders in the capital, learn from the experiences of our brotherly troops, return to our units, quickly eliminate the remaining bandits and special agents, do a good job in the army, and be ready at any time to give the imperialist aggressors a head-on blow, resolutely defend our motherland, and safeguard lasting world peace.
　　On this great National Day, I would like to express this little determination. Imperialists, listen: your road has only one direction, and that is towards extinction! Victory belongs to us!

　　学习了各兄弟部队的经验更有力量地坚决保卫祖国
    西南军区、二野战斗英雄  卫小堂
    去年十一月，我代表中国人民解放军第二野战军出席了中国人民政治协商会议。当时，我们的部队正是执行了毛主席、朱总司令的进军命令和第三、第四野战军一致行动，打过了长江，解放了南京和广大地区，宣告了蒋匪小朝廷统治的灭亡，中国人民出现了空前统一的局面。我们在政协会议上，全体一致地通过了三大文献，确立了中国人民的根本大法。十月一日，我们在这里由中国人民的领袖，中央人民政府毛泽东主席庄严地宣布了中华人民共和国的成立，这是中国人民百多年来所期望的，也是我们艰苦奋斗了二十多年所期望的目标。中国人民站起来了。作为中国人民解放军的一分子，我感到无上的光荣，无限的兴奋，这时，我们部队又开始了向西南进军，执行解放全国，肃清残余蒋匪帮的任务。我赶回部队，向同志们传达了政协的巨大收获，大家也都是万分振奋，并一致表示坚决拥护中央人民政府，决心消灭帝国主义及其走狗在中国的残余力量，在这种鼓舞之下，我们于去年十一、十二两个月五十七天之内，就解放了西藏除外的西南各省，又进行了征粮，剿匪，修路、修堤，建立与巩固人民政权等工作。并在部队中开始了新的文化学习运动，建设一支强大的现代化的国防军，来保卫祖国，保卫世界持久和平。
    今天，我又当选为西南军区的战斗英雄，来首都出席全国战斗英雄代表会议，得在这里参加建国一周年的国庆纪念，更有说不出的高兴。
    现在美国帝国主义发动了对朝鲜人民的侵略战争，又不断地对我国进行侵略行为，我和我们西南军区所有的同志听到以后，莫不愤慨万分。我们相信，经过了一百多年英勇奋斗的中国人民和经过了二十多年千万次战斗考验的中国人民解放军，在共产党、毛主席领导之下，在全国一致拥护的中央人民政府领导之下，是不能容忍任何帝国主义的侵略的，我们的责任就是在首都接受中央各首长的指示，学习各兄弟部队的经验，回到部队，迅速肃清残余土匪特务，把部队工作做好，随时准备给帝国主义侵略者以迎头痛击，坚决保卫我们的祖国，保卫世界持久和平。
    在这伟大的国庆日，我就表示这么一点决心，帝国主义听着：你们的道路只有一条，就是走向灭亡！胜利是属于我们的！
