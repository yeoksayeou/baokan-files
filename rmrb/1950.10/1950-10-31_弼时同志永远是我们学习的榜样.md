　　Comrade Bi Shi Will Always Be Our Role Model
    Li Zhuoran
    At 12:36 on October 27th, Comrade Ren Bishi, one of the brilliant leaders of our Party and one of Chairman Mao's close comrades-in-arms, finally ceased the beating of his great heart, which was intimately connected with the Chinese people. I heard this sad news at 10:00 a.m. on the 28th and was deeply saddened. I recall that in 1931, when I was working in the Secretariat of the Central Bureau of the Party Central Committee in the Central Revolutionary Base in Jiangxi, Comrade Bishi was then the Minister of the Organization Department of the Central Bureau; his amiable and patient attitude often made me particularly like to approach him and consult him. Whether it was drafting meeting notices, organizing meeting minutes, or distributing accommodation houses, he would patiently give me specific instructions. Later, during my time doing political work in the army and local work in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, I often consulted Comrade Bishi with other comrades on work-related issues. Every time after listening to his instructions, I always felt a little reluctant to leave, wanting to stay a little longer and talk to him more, but I was afraid of delaying his more important matters. This feeling often made us feel embarrassed in front of him. Comrade Bishi sometimes talked with us freely, regardless of how busy he was, even until late at night. His words were always the most vivid and moving, often inspiring us with a new working method. Comrade Bishi was the best at contacting the masses. He more than once explained to us in a consultative manner the results of his own investigation and research among the masses, often making the comrades who listened feel a special excitement. His serious and meticulous consideration of problems in his work, his serious and responsible attitude towards revolutionary work, and his adherence to principles in the struggle against incorrect tendencies within the Party will always be a model for us to learn from. Comrade Bishi devoted his life to the great cause of liberation of the Chinese people. His death comes precisely at a time when the Chinese people's revolution, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, has achieved historically significant great victories, and precisely when the Chinese people's deadly enemy, American imperialism, is frantically carrying out aggression and provocation in the face of powerful people's forces. In order to compensate for the loss caused by the death of Comrade Bishi, we should enthusiastically respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, learn from the example of Comrade Bishi, unite as one under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and fight to the end to crush American aggression, consolidate the national defense of the motherland, and continue to develop the people's revolutionary construction!
    Great Chinese people's statesman and heroic fighter Comrade Ren Bishi, rest in peace!

　　弼时同志永远是我们学习的榜样
    李卓然
    十月二十七日十二时三十六分，我党英明领导者之一，毛主席亲密战友之一，任弼时同志终于停止了他那与中国人民息息相关的伟大心脏的跳动。我于二十八日上午十时闻此噩耗，深为悲痛。回忆一九三一年，我在江西中央革命根据地党中央局秘书处工作的时候，弼时同志是当时中央局组织部长；他那和蔼可亲与诲人不倦的态度，常常使我特别喜欢去接近他、请教他，不管是起草开会通知、整理会议记录，或分配宿营地房子，这样的事情他都不厌烦地给我具体指示。以后，我在军队中作政治工作及在陕甘宁边区做地方工作的时期，也常常因为工作问题和其他同志一道去请教过弼时同志。当每一次听完他的指示后，总有点不想走，想多留一会儿和他多谈谈，但又怕耽误了他的更紧要的事情。这种心情常常使我们在他的面前感到为难。弼时同志有时竟不顾任何繁忙和我们畅谈起来，直至深夜不止。他的话总是最生动最动听的，常常启示我们一种新的工作方法。弼时同志是最善于联系群众的，他不只一次地把他在群众中亲自调查研究的结果用商量的态度给我们讲解，常常使听了后的同志感到一种特别的兴奋。他在工作中考虑问题的认真细致，他对革命工作的严肃的负责态度和他在反对党内不正确倾向的斗争中坚持原则的斗争精神，永远是我们学习的榜样。弼时同志以其毕生精力贡献于中国人民的伟大解放事业。他的逝世正是中国人民革命在毛主席领导下已经获得了有历史意义的巨大胜利的时候，也正是中国人民的死敌美帝国主义在强大人民力量面前疯狂地进行侵略挑衅的时候。为了补偿弼时同志逝世所造成的损失，我们应热烈地响应党中央的号召，学习弼时同志的榜样，团结一致地在毛主席领导下，为粉碎美国侵略，巩固祖国的国防，继续发展人民的革命建设事业而奋斗到底！
    中国人民伟大的政治家和英勇战士任弼时同志，你安息吧！
