Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 17th—Shaanxi Province held its first provincial judicial conference last month in Xi'an. The conference criticized the right-leaning tendencies in past judicial work, which included boundless leniency and treating principal offenders and accomplices the same. The Shaanxi Provincial Judicial Conference pointed out: Some counties treated counter-revolutionaries and ordinary bandits the same, granting them the same leniency. For example, the People's Court of Luochuan County sentenced a Kuomintang secret agent who had killed a revolutionary cadre to ten years in prison, but the county People's Government administrative meeting still considered it too heavy and did not approve it. In some areas, because the policy of combining leniency with suppression was not grasped, it instead fueled the arrogance of secret agents and bandits. The recent intensified activities of scattered bandits and secret agents in Guanzhong and Southern Shaanxi, as well as the rumors and deceptions of the Yiguandao sect, are in part due to the serious errors of boundless leniency in judicial work. The conference emphasized: We must thoroughly overcome the sense of complacency and underestimation of the enemy that has grown out of the victory of the revolution, and earnestly grasp the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionary activities. Those enemies who are unrepentant and continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, and those counter-revolutionary elements who have committed heinous crimes, must be severely suppressed. The conference also decided: In the new districts of Guanzhong, judicial organs should prioritize handling cases of bandits and secret agents before land reform is carried out, and resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary activities, so that land reform work can be carried out effectively.

    陕西举行司法会议批判宽大无边偏向
    【新华社西安十七日电】陕西省于上月在西安举行了全省首届司法会议。会议对过去司法工作上存在的宽大无边、不分首恶与胁从分子而一样对待的右倾偏向进行了批判。陕西省司法会议指出：有些县份不分反革命分子和一般匪犯，同样予以宽大对待。如洛川县人民法院判处一个曾杀害过革命干部的国民党特务以十年徒刑，但是该县人民政府行政会议还认为太重，未予通过。有些地区因为没有掌握宽大与镇压相结合的政策，反而助长了特务土匪的嚣张。最近关中、陕南零星土匪特务的加紧活动，以及一贯道的造谣欺骗，其重要原因之一就是司法工作上宽大无边的严重错误所致。会议强调指出：必须彻底克服因革命胜利而生长起来的太平观念和轻敌思想，切实掌握镇压反革命活动的政策。对怙恶不悛、继续进行反革命活动的敌人，和罪大恶极的反革命分子，必须予以严厉镇压。会议并决定：关中新区各地司法机关在该地未进行土地改革前，应尽先办理土匪特务案件，坚决镇压反革命活动，以便土地改革工作能很好地进行。
