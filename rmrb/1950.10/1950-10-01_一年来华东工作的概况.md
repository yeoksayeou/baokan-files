　　An Overview of Work in East China Over the Past Year
    Rao Shushi
    Today marks the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. All the Chinese people celebrate our first National Day and the great achievements we have made in the past year with unparalleled joy.

    In this year, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the CPC Central Committee, and the Central People's Government, the people of East China, relying on the arduous struggle of the People's Liberation Army, the consciousness and unity of the people, and the great strength of workers, peasants, women, and youth, have overcome many difficulties and achieved significant victories.

    Now I would like to briefly describe the work situation in East China over the past year:

    I. Military Aspects:

    After completing the task of liberating all of mainland East China by the end of September last year, the East China People's Liberation Army immediately launched a region-wide campaign to suppress bandits and eliminate the remnants of the enemy on coastal islands. Over the past year, our army has successively liberated Xiamen, the Shengsi Islands, the Zhoushan Islands, and most other coastal islands, annihilating more than 30,000 enemy remnants. Now, except for Kinmen, Taiwan, and other individual small islands, the entire East China region has been liberated. Due to the liberation of the Zhoushan and Shengsi Islands and the strengthening of our naval and air forces, we have shattered the enemy's blockade of Shanghai and the East China coast. In the course of suppressing bandits in various places over the past year, we annihilated more than 137,000 bandits. At present, banditry has been basically eliminated in the entire East China region except for parts of Fujian and Zhejiang. Our local garrison troops and public security forces, relying on the masses, have continuously cracked down on a large number of bandit and special agent cases, safeguarding the stability of order in various cities. Currently, the entire East China army is universally engaged in technical and cultural studies, striving to actively prepare for the liberation of Taiwan and the consolidation of national defense.

    II. Urban Industry and Commerce:

    Over the past year, we have completed the takeover of major cities in Jiangnan and the huge bureaucratic capital; we have organized more than 1.8 million workers (accounting for 59% of the total number of workers in East China). Relying on the working class, we have begun to reform the management systems and operating methods of various old enterprises, completely freeing them from dependence on imperialist economies. We resolutely implemented the central government's measures to unify national financial and economic work and basically completed tasks such as public grain, taxation, and public bonds, stabilizing prices and freeing the people from the suffering of inflation and price fluctuations over the past decade. We resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's and the Central People's Government's instructions on adjusting the relationship between industry and commerce, taking measures such as processing, ordering, purchasing, loans, and relieving unemployed workers, so that industry and commerce in East China could also overcome the serious difficulties in the restructuring of the entire old social economic structure. For example, from April to August this year, we entrusted private textile factories in Shanghai to process a total of 96,986 bales of cotton yarn, more than 1.32 million bolts of cotton cloth, and more than 1.08 million bolts of dyed cloth. Orders for electrical, mechanical, and steel industries reached 26.6 million equivalent units. Loans (including loans from joint public-private banks) totaled 343.18 billion yuan. Due to the above measures and the partial recovery of rural purchasing power, industry and commerce in East China have generally begun to improve. For example, in Shanghai, the number of factories applying for closure decreased from 502 in May to 62 in August. The number of shops applying for closure decreased from 2,947 in May to 235 in August. The number of factories applying to resume operations increased from 3 in May to 93 in August. The number of shops applying to resume operations increased from 22 in May to 115 in August. The number of factories applying to start businesses increased from 21 in May to 373 in August. The number of shops applying to start businesses increased from 72 in May to 786 in August. For another example, in the three cities of Jinan, Qingdao, and Xuzhou in Shandong, 506 businesses opened and 1,574 closed in May, a net decrease of 1,068 businesses, but by August, the number of businesses opening exceeded the number closing by 590. As another example, in major cities throughout Zhejiang Province, 435 businesses opened and 1,149 closed in May, a net decrease of 714 businesses, but by July, 609 businesses opened and 190 closed, an increase of 419. However, we must point out that the current general improvement in industry and commerce in East China is still preliminary and not yet consolidated. Therefore, we must prevent blind optimism and focus on adjusting production and sales relationships and urban-rural relationships in order to strive for a further and more solid improvement in industry and commerce.

    III. Water Conservancy, Disaster Relief, and Agricultural Production:

    Last year, East China generally suffered from varying degrees of flooding, with Anhui Province north of the Huai River, Jiangsu Province north of the Yangtze River, and Shandong Province being particularly severe. More than 53 million mu of cultivated land in the region were flooded, directly affecting more than 16 million people. Production and disaster relief became the overriding central tasks in rural areas at that time. Under the policy of combining production with disaster relief, governments at all levels in East China generally adopted methods such as providing work relief, building water conservancy projects, developing sideline production, and widely planting early-maturing crops to overcome the disaster. Taking water conservancy alone, a total of more than 197.7 million cubic meters of earthwork were completed in East China in one year, with more than 3 million people directly participating in water conservancy projects, and approximately 1 billion jin of grain and funds were directly and indirectly used for disaster relief. Due to the successful completion of the above-mentioned water conservancy projects, not only were more than 23 million mu of cultivated land in disaster areas able to avoid or mitigate floods, but also more than 9 million mu of cultivated land in non-disaster areas benefited from water conservancy irrigation. Due to the Central People's Government's various instructions and measures to encourage agricultural production, the hard work of farmers in various places, and the loans, seed loans, purchases, and regulation of cotton seeds by local financial and economic institutions and cooperatives, East China, except for most areas of northern Anhui and parts of northern Jiangsu that continued to suffer severe flooding, generally reported a bumper harvest this year. It is estimated that the total grain output in East China this year can be increased to 56 billion jin, approximately 78% of the pre-war grain production level of 71.9 billion jin. The total output of ginned cotton can be increased to more than 3.6 million dan, approximately 78% of the pre-war peak output of 4.6 million dan. It is precisely because of the general bumper harvest in various places this year and our experience in overcoming last year's disasters that we have more confidence and certainty in continuing to overcome the severe disasters in northern Anhui in the future.

    IV. People's Political Power Construction:

    In the vast new areas of East China, after nearly a year of campaigns to suppress bandits, oppose local tyrants, reduce rent, and rationalize the burden, farmers' associations have been universally established from top to bottom and enriched from bottom to top. According to existing incomplete figures, the number of farmers' association members in the new areas of East China has reached more than 13 million. In the new areas where the masses of peasants have been mobilized and farmers' associations have been established, the rural grassroots political power has been basically transformed, and the Baojia system has been abolished. Cities with a population of more than 30,000 and 405 counties throughout East China, with the exception of some areas where bandits have not yet been eliminated and those that have been liberated recently, have generally held people's representative conferences from all walks of life. Shandong and Zhejiang provinces and the Southern Jiangsu and Southern Anhui administrative regions have held provincial and regional people's representative conferences. Fujian, Northern Jiangsu, and Northern Anhui are also preparing to convene them. Through the people's representative conferences from all walks of life, the connection between the people's government and the masses of the people has been greatly strengthened, and the sense of responsibility and enthusiasm of people from all walks of life for the construction of the people's country and local areas has been greatly enhanced. This has played a huge role in consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, overcoming difficulties in work, and ensuring the completion of land reform and the adjustment of industrial and commercial relations.

    V. Culture and Education:

    Over the past year, the cultural and educational work in the East China region has been gradually improving. We have adopted a policy of maintaining and transforming existing public and private schools, and have taken various relief measures for unemployed teachers and students. We have extensively launched spare-time cultural supplementary education for worker-peasant cadres and trained a large number of land reform cadres to meet the needs of the current new situation. According to incomplete statistics: there are currently more than 2,000 various vocational and industrial spare-time learning organizations in the East China region, with approximately 200,000 students (mainly in major and medium-sized cities in the new areas). Last winter, more than 3 million farmers in various places participated in winter school studies (mainly in the old liberated areas of Shandong). Literary and artistic work and health work in East China have also made considerable achievements, and the people's political and cultural level has begun to gradually improve. Taking movies as an example: before liberation, American films completely dominated the Shanghai market. The number of screenings of American films accounted for more than 80% of all films (including domestic films and Soviet films). The average monthly audience was 1.4 million, with American films accounting for about 75% of the total audience. However, by August this year, the number of screenings of American films accounted for only 36% of all films, and the audience accounted for only 17% of the total monthly audience of more than 1.8 million. The number of screenings of domestic and Soviet films has reached 64%, and the monthly audience has accounted for 83%.

    In summary, over the past year, we have achieved great success in various aspects of our work in East China, but there are also many shortcomings and errors. In order to promote achievements and correct mistakes, a rectification movement is being universally launched in various places. Therefore, we believe that shortcomings and errors can be overcome.

    The tasks facing the people of East China today are still arduous and difficult. We must complete the land reform in the East China region, strive for a better financial and economic situation, and complete the glorious task of liberating Taiwan. We clearly know that in the process of completing the above arduous tasks, we will encounter many difficulties. But we firmly believe that relying on the leadership of Chairman Mao, the CPC Central Committee, and the Central People's Government, and relying on the solid unity of the entire army and people, any difficulty can be overcome, and no difficulty can stop the progress of our people's cause.

　　一年来华东工作的概况
    饶漱石
    今天是中华人民共和国诞生一周年。全中国人民都以无比的欢欣，来庆祝我们第一个国庆日和庆祝我们过去一年来伟大的成就。
    在这一年中，我华东人民在毛主席、中共中央和中央人民政府的英明领导下，依靠人民解放军的艰苦奋斗，依靠人民的觉悟和团结，依靠工人、农民、妇女、青年的伟大力量，克服了许多的困难，取得了重大的胜利。
    现在我想将过去一年来华东工作情况概括说明如下：
    一、军事方面：
    华东人民解放军于去年九月底完成了解放华东全部大陆的任务后，随即展开全区剿匪和肃清沿海各岛屿残敌的工作。一年来，我军先后解放厦门、嵊泗列岛、舟山群岛等沿海大部岛屿，歼灭残敌三万余人。现在除金门、台湾及其他个别小岛外，华东全区均已解放。由于舟山群岛、嵊泗列岛的解放和我海空军的加强，我们粉碎了敌人对上海及华东沿海的封锁。在一年来各地剿匪过程中，我们共残灭土匪十三万七千余人。现在华东全境除福建及浙江部分地区外，股匪已经基本肃清。我各地警卫部队和公安武装，依靠群众，接连不断地破获了大批匪特案件，保卫了各城市秩序的安定。目前我华东全军正在普遍进行技术学习和文化学习，为积极准备解放台湾和巩固国防而努力。
    二、城市工商业方面：
    一年来我们完成了对江南各大城市及庞大的官僚资本的接管工作；我们已把一百八十万以上的工人（占全华东工人总数百分之五十九）组织起来。我们依靠工人阶级，开始改革各种旧有企业的管理制度及经营方法，并使其完全摆脱对帝国主义经济的依赖。我们坚决执行中央关于统一国家财政经济工作的措施，并基本上完成了公粮、税收、公债等任务，使物价趋于稳定，使人民摆脱过去十余年来通货膨胀、物价波动的苦难。我们坚决执行毛主席及中央人民政府关于调整工商业关系的指示，采取加工、订货、收购、贷款、救济失业工人等办法，使华东各地工商业同样渡过整个旧社会经济结构重新改组中的严重困难。例如从今年四月到八月，我们在上海共委托私营纺织厂加工棉纱九万六千九百八十六件，棉布一百三十二万余匹。染布一百零八万余匹。电器、机械、钢铁等工业订货达二千六百六十万折实单位。贷款（包括公私合营银行贷款在内）累计三万四千三百一十八亿元。由于上述措施及农村购买力局部恢复，目前华东各地工商业已普遍开始好转。例如上海申请歇业的工厂五月份为五百零二户，八月份减至六十二户。申请歇业的商店五月份为二千九百四十七户，八月份减至二百三十五户。申请复业的工厂五月份为三户，八月份增至九十三户。申请复业的商店五月份为二十二户，八月份增至一百一十五户。申请创业的工厂五月份为二十一户，八月份增至三百七十三户。申请创业的商店五月份为七十二户，八月份增至七百八十六户。又例如山东济南、青岛、徐州三个城市，五月份开业五百零六户，歇业一千五百七十四户，计减少一千零六十八户，但到八月份开业比歇业增多五百九十户。又例如浙江全省各大城市，五月份开业四百三十五户，歇业一千一百四十九户，计减少七百一十四户，但到七月份开业六百零九户，歇业一百九十户，增多四百一十九户。不过我们必须指出：目前华东各地工商业普遍好转的现象，还是初步的和不巩固的。因此，必须防止盲目乐观，并应着重注意调整产销关系和城乡关系，才能争取工商业进一步走向坚固的好转。
    三、水利、救灾、和农业生产方面：
    去年华东各地普遍遭受不同程度的水灾，皖北、苏北、山东特别严重。全区耕地被淹五千三百余万亩，直接受灾人口达一千六百余万人。生产救灾成为当时农村压倒一切的中心任务。在生产与救灾相结合的方针下，华东各级人民政府曾普遍采取以工代赈、兴修水利、发展副业生产和广种早熟作物等办法，以克服灾荒。仅就兴修水利一项来说，一年内华东全区完成水利工程共计一亿九千七百七十余万土方，直接参加水利工程的人数三百余万人，直接间接用于救灾的粮款约十亿斤。由于上述水利工程的胜利完成，不但使灾区二千三百余万亩耕地得以避免或减轻水灾，而且使非灾区九百余万亩耕地受到水利灌溉的利益。由于中央人民政府各种鼓励农业生产的指示和措施，由于各地农民的努力生产，由于各地财经机关和合作社的贷款、贷种、收购、调剂棉种，今年华东全区，除皖北大部及苏北一部分地区继续遭受严重的水灾外，已普告丰收。估计今年华东全区粮食总产量可提高到五百六十亿斤，约达战前粮食生产水平七百十九亿斤的百分之七十八。皮棉总产量可提高到三百六十万担以上，约达战前皮棉最高产量四百六十万担的百分之七十八。正由于今年各地普遍丰收及我们有了克服去年灾荒的经验，更增加了我们对今后继续克服皖北严重灾荒的信心和把握。
    四、人民政权建设方面：
    华东广大新区，经过近一年来剿匪、反霸、减租、合理负担运动，各地农民协会已普遍自上而下建立和自下而上充实起来。根据现有不完全的数字，华东新区农会会员已达一千三百万以上。在农民群众已经发动，农民协会已经建立的新区，农村基层政权已经基本改造，保甲制度已经废除。华东全区三万以上人口的城市及四百零五个县，除部分土匪尚未肃清和解放不久者外，均已普遍开过各界人民代表会议。山东、浙江二省和苏南、皖南二行政区，已经开过省的和区的各界人民代表会议。福建、苏北、皖北亦正在筹备召开中。各地通过各界人民代表会议，大大加强了人民政府与人民群众的联系，大大提高了各界人民对人民国家和地方建设的责任心和积极性。这对于巩固人民民主专政，克服工作中的困难，及保证完成土地改革与调整工商业关系，都起了巨大的作用。
    五、文化教育方面：
    一年来华东地区的文化教育工作是在逐渐改进与提高的过程中。我们对现有公私立学校是采取维持和改造的方针，对失业教师与失学学生是采取各种救济的办法。我们广泛展开工农干部业余文化补习教育和训练大批土地改革工作干部，以适应目前新的情况的需要。根据不完全的统计：华东全区现有各种职工业余学习组织约二千余处，学员约二十余万人（主要在新区各大中城市中）。去年冬季，各地参加冬学学习的农民达三百万人以上（主要在山东老解放区内）。华东各地文艺工作和卫生工作，也有相当的成就，人民政治文化水平已开始逐步提高。以电影为例：在解放前，美国影片在上海完全居于垄断独占的地位。美国影片的放映数占全部影片（包括国产影片和苏联影片等）百分之八十以上。每月观众平均一百四十万人，美国影片占去全部观众的百分之七十五左右。但是到今年八月，美国影片的放映数仅占全部影片百分之三十六，观众仅占全月一百八十余万人的百分之十七。国产影片和苏联影片的放映数已占百分之六十四，全月观众已占百分之八十三。
    总之，一年来我华东各方面工作，取得了很大的成绩，同时也存在着不少的缺点和错误。我们为了发扬成绩和改正错误，各地正在普遍展开整风运动。因此，我们相信缺点和错误是可以克服的。
    今天摆在我华东人民面前的任务仍然是繁重而艰巨的。我们必须完成华东地区的土地改革，必须争取财政经济情况更加好转，必须完成解放台湾的光荣任务。我们清楚知道，在我们完成上述艰巨的任务的过程中，我们还将要遭遇着很多的困难。但我们坚决相信，我们依靠毛主席、中共中央和中央人民政府的领导，依靠全体军民的巩固团结，任何困难都是可以战胜的，任何困难都不能阻止我们人民事业的前进。
