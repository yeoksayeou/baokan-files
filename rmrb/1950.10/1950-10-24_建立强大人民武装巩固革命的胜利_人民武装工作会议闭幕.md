　　Establish Strong People's Armed Forces to Consolidate the Victory of the Revolution
    People's Armed Forces Work Conference Concludes
    Commander-in-Chief Zhu calls on the organization of demobilized soldiers and the vast number of young adults to completely eliminate bandits, spies, and all enemies left over from feudal society.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 23rd] The National People's Armed Forces Work Conference convened in Beijing by the People's Armed Forces Department of the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission, lasting half a month, concluded on the 20th. Attendees included Zhang Jingwu, Minister of the People's Armed Forces Department, Deputy Minister Fu Qiutao, and thirty-two cadres from the People's Armed Forces of the Northeast, North China, Northwest, East China, Southwest, and Central South Military Regions. The conference, in accordance with Article 23 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference regarding the implementation of the militia system, and based on the foundation of the national militia work, determined the basic principles and tasks of the national People's Armed Forces work, and drafted proposals.
    Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Luo Ronghuan, Director of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, attended the meeting on the closing day and delivered speeches. Commander-in-Chief Zhu said: We must organize demobilized soldiers and veterans, not only to properly arrange their lives, but also to give them things to do. At the same time, we must organize the vast number of young adults into the militia, so that they can receive military training and political education, tell them who the enemy is and who our own forces are, and mobilize them to completely eliminate bandits, spies, and all enemies left over from feudal society. Commander-in-Chief Zhu said: This is a very long-term, meticulous, and arduous task. People's Armed Forces organizations at all levels must obtain the assistance and cooperation of public security, civil affairs departments, and mass organizations such as workers, peasants, youth, and women in order to do this work well.
    Director Luo Ronghuan said in his speech:
    The development, consolidation, and training of the militia should be combined with the main tasks in rural areas.
    Director Luo Ronghuan pointed out in his speech: Militia work is mass work. The development, consolidation, and training of the militia must be combined with the current main tasks in rural areas and all social reforms. In the old liberated areas, militia work must be combined with the restoration and development of production. In the newly liberated areas, militia work must be combined with land reform, and the peasants should be enlightened to consciously organize armed forces under the slogan of "defending the fruits of the peasants' emancipation." If militia work deviates from this principle, it will produce coercive orders and formalistic practices, and it will become divorced from the masses. Director Luo Ronghuan also pointed out: The training of the militia should not interfere with agricultural work, and militia political education should be carried out in the popularization of education in rural areas. In education, some militia members' undisciplined behavior and estrangement from the masses should be corrected, so that the militia can closely link with the masses and serve as a model of supporting the government and cherishing the people, and supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to the families of soldiers.
    Minister Zhang Jingwu pointed out:
    The national militia has more than 5 million members and has become a powerful pillar of the people's democratic dictatorship.
    Minister Zhang Jingwu pointed out in his concluding report at the conference: Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the militia has developed greatly over the years, and has reached more than 5.5 million nationwide so far. They have played an active and significant role in the cause of the Chinese revolution. During the Anti-Japanese War, the militia cooperated with the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army to launch extensive guerrilla warfare and defeat Japanese imperialism. In the Liberation War, the militia enlisted in the army and participated in the war in large numbers, assisting the People's Liberation Army in defeating the American imperialist running dog, the Kuomintang bandit gang, and achieved the basic victory of the Liberation War nationwide. In maintaining public order in the rear, the militia actively participated in suppressing bandits and eliminating special agents, safeguarding local order, and becoming one of the powerful pillars for defending the people's democratic dictatorship. Minister Zhang Jingwu also pointed out: In order to oppose the imperialist war of aggression, defend world peace, and consolidate and develop the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, we must establish a strong people's armed forces, overcome the peace thinking of neglecting militia work and laying down our weapons; we must reorganize and consolidate the militia organization, strengthen the military training and political education of the militia, and improve the military skills and political consciousness of the militia, in order to lay a good foundation for national mobilization.

　　建立强大人民武装巩固革命的胜利
    人民武装工作会议闭幕
    朱总司令号召把复员军人、广大青壮年组织起来，发动他们彻底消灭土匪、奸细和封建社会遗留下来的一切敌人。
    【新华社二十三日讯】中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会人民武装部在京召开的全国人民武装工作会议，历时半月，已于二十日闭幕。出席会议者有人民武装部张经武部长、傅秋涛副部长及东北、华北、西北、华东、西南、中南各大军区人民武装工作干部三十二人。会议遵照中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第二十三条关于实行民兵制度的规定，并根据全国民兵工作的基础，确定了全国人民武装工作的基本方针和任务，拟制了草案。
    朱总司令、人民革命军事委员会总政治部罗荣桓主任于会议闭幕日莅会致词。朱总司令说：要把复员军人、荣誉军人组织起来，不仅要好好地安置他们生活，而且要给他们事情做。同时，还要把广大青壮年组织到民兵中来，使他们受军事训练和政治教育，告诉他们什么是敌人，什么是自己的队伍，发动他们去彻底消灭土匪、奸细和封建社会所遗留下来的一切敌人。朱总司令说：这是一件很长久、很细致、很繁重的工作，人民武装部各级组织必须取得公安、民政各部门和工人、农民、青年、妇女等群众团体的协助和配合，才能做好这个工作。
    罗荣桓主任致词：
    发展、巩固和训练民兵要与农村主要工作结合
    罗荣桓主任致词中指出：民兵工作是群众工作。发展、巩固和训练民兵必须与农村当前的主要任务与一切社会改革事业相结合进行。在老解放区，民兵工作必须与恢复和发展生产相结合。在新解放区，民兵工作必须与土地改革相结合，在“保卫农民翻身果实”的口号下启发农民自觉地起来组织武装。民兵工作如果离开了这个原则，便会产生强迫命令和形式主义的错误作法，便会脱离群众。罗荣桓主任并指出：训练民兵要不误农时，民兵政治教育应放在农村普及教育中去进行。在教育中，应纠正某些民兵违反纪律和脱离群众的作风，使民兵密切联系群众，成为拥政爱民，拥军优属的模范。
    张经武部长指出：
    全国民兵已有五百多万成为民主专政有力支柱
    张经武部长在会议总结报告中指出：在中国共产党、毛主席、朱总司令的正确领导下，多年来民兵有了很大的发展，至目前为止全国已达五百五十万以上。他们在中国革命事业中起着积极的重大的作用。抗日战争时期，民兵配合八路军新四军展开了广泛的游击战争，打败了日本帝国主义。在解放战争中，民兵大批的参军参战，协助人民解放军打败了美帝国主义走狗国民党匪帮，取得了解放战争在全国范围内的基本胜利。在维持后方治安中，民兵积极参加剿匪肃特，保卫地方秩序，又成为保卫人民民主专政的有力支柱之一。张经武部长并指出：为反对帝国主义的侵略战争，保卫世界和平，巩固与发展中国人民革命的胜利，我们必须建立强大的人民武装，克服忽视民兵工作和放下武器的和平思想；必须整顿和巩固民兵组织，加强民兵的军事训练和政治教育，提高民兵的军事技术和政治觉悟，以期为国家奠定良好的动员基础。
