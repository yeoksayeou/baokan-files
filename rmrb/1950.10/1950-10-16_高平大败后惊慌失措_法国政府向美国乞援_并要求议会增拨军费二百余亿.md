　　After the Great Defeat at Cao Bằng, the French Government Panics and Begs the United States for Aid
    And Asks the Parliament to Increase Military Spending by More Than 20 Billion
    [Xinhua News Agency, 15th Dispatch] The recent great victory of the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army between Cao Bằng and Qiqihe has alarmed the French authorities. According to a Paris dispatch from the United Press on the 12th: "The French government is deeply troubled by the sudden turn of events in the Vietnam war. Only two weeks ago, the French government spokesman continued to say that the French army "had the initiative in its hands" and would continue to do so in the future. The "tragedy" of Cao Bằng, one of the most serious "tragedies" in French colonial history, has shocked the French government and the public, and has aroused strong accusations from newspapers on all sides against the government. A motion of impeachment against the government in the National Assembly is brewing." An Associated Press dispatch from Saigon on the 12th also admitted: "After the French army lost several battalions northwest of Qiqihe, the military balance between the French army and the Viet Cong (referring to the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army), which had been barely maintained for several years, has been completely shaken."
    When commenting on the situation in Vietnam, the bourgeois newspapers in Paris criticized the French government's "miscalculations." "Le Figaro" believed that the government was "satisfied for too long" with the "small package" strategy, and now France "has missed the opportunity too much." "L'Aurore" and "Le Temps" also "severely criticized the government's handling of the situation in Vietnam." "Franc-Tireur," in desperation, asked the French government to try its best to win American aid.
    Faced with this situation, the French government is planning new struggles and begging its "Uncle Sam" for aid. French military experts hastily convened a meeting on the 12th, chaired by Prime Minister Plevin, to discuss "the troops that can be transferred from mainland France to Vietnam." A spokesman for the French Ministry of Finance declared that the government would ask the National Assembly to allocate another 25 billion francs in addition to the 120 billion francs already allocated this year for France's colonial war in Vietnam. French Minister of Defense Moc and French Minister of Finance Biju also flew to Washington on the 11th and 12th respectively to beg for American aid. On the 13th, Moc and Biju held consultations with U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, Secretary of Defense Marshall, and Secretary of the Treasury Snyder. Moc has submitted a note to Marshall requesting that the delivery of American military supplies to support the French army be accelerated. The French government will also request a US$770 million loan to double France's military spending next year.

　　高平大败后惊慌失措
    法国政府向美国乞援
    并要求议会增拨军费二百余亿
    【新华社十五日讯】越南人民解放军最近在高平和七溪之间获得的巨大胜利，已使法国当局惊慌失措。据合众社巴黎十二日电：“法国政府已因越南战局的急转直下而大感烦恼。仅在两周以前，法国政府发言人还在继言法军“主动在握”，今后仍将如此。高平的“惨剧”，是法国殖民史上最严重的“惨剧”之一，已使法国朝野震惊，并激起各方面报纸对政府的激烈指责。国民议会对此事的弹劾案已在酝酿中。”美联社西贡十二日电亦承认：“法军在七溪西北损失数营后，已使法军与越共（按指越南人民解放军）间数年来勉强保持的军事均势，完全动摇”。
    巴黎各资产阶级报纸在评论越南战局时，纷纷抨击法国政府的“失策”。“费嘉罗报”认为政府对“小捆扎”的战略“满意得太长久了”，而现在法国“已太失去时机了”。《震旦报》和《时代报》也“严词批评政府对越南情势处理的办法”。《自由射手报》在无可奈何之余，要求法国政府尽量争取美援。
    面临着这种情势，法国政府正在计划作新的挣扎，并向其“山姆大叔”乞援。法国的军事专家们于十二日在总理普利文主持下急忙召开会议，讨论“法国本土上可能调赴越南的兵力”。法国财政部发言人宣称：政府将要求国民议会在本年内已拨款项一千二百亿法郎之外，再拨二百五十亿法郎，供法国在越南进行殖民战争之用。法国国防部长莫克和法国财政部长比许也于十一、十二日先后飞抵华盛顿，乞求美国的援助。莫克和比许于十三日和美国务卿艾奇逊、国防部长马歇尔及财长斯奈德举行会商。莫克已向马歇尔提出照会一件，要求加紧运送美国军火支援法军。法国政府并将要求美国贷款七亿七千万美元，以使法国明年的军费增加一倍。
