Xinhua News Agency, 30th. Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic, István Dobi, sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government of our country, congratulating us on our National Day. The text of the telegram is as follows:

To Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China:

Please accept the warm congratulations of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic and myself on the occasion of the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The Hungarian people are joyfully and attentively watching the heroic liberation struggle of the Chinese people—under the leadership of the Communist Party and yourself, the Chinese people have finally broken free from the oppression of imperialism and feudal forces for hundreds of years.

We sincerely hope that the Chinese people will quickly liberate the regions that have not yet been liberated.

The Chinese people's world-historical victory and firm opposition to the imperialist position of aggression against your country is a powerful blow to the plans of war provocateurs, and further contributes to the consolidation of the peace camp headed by the great Soviet Union.

I wish your country great achievements in the cause of restoring its own country and in the struggle for independence.

István Dobi
Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic
September 29
