Two Marxist-Leninist Books on Religion

    On September 23, newspapers carried a declaration signed by 1,500 Chinese Christians, including Wu Yaozong, Deng Yuzhi, Zhao Zichen, Liu Liangmo, and Tu Yuqing, entitled "The Path of Effort for Chinese Christianity in the Construction of New China." This newspaper also published an editorial on the same day entitled "The Patriotic Movement of Christian Personages," stating: "We believe that the people of the whole country, like the majority of patriotic Christians in the country, will express warm welcome to this declaration."

    As the declaration states: "Not long after Christianity was introduced to China, imperialism began its activities in China. And because the people who brought Christianity to China mainly came from these imperialist countries, Christianity became related to imperialism, intentionally or unintentionally, visibly or invisibly. Now, the Chinese revolution has triumphed. Imperialism will not be reconciled to this unprecedented fact in Chinese history. They will exhaust every means to try to undermine this accomplished fact; they will also use Christianity to carry out their conspiracies of sowing discord and attempting to create reactionary forces in China." Therefore, the patriotic Christian's timely proposal to support the Common Program, oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and strive to build an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous New China is of great significance in preventing imperialists from using religion to invade China and in promoting the unity of religious and non-religious people throughout the country to work together. Since it is beneficial to the interests of the country and the people, it should naturally receive enthusiastic support from the people.

    Here, it is very necessary to study the complete Marxist-Leninist view on religion, because our emphasis on the patriotic movement in the religious community is based on a clear understanding of the religious question.

    The two books introduced here are sufficient to help readers understand this point. The booklet *Socialism and Religion* includes three articles by Lenin: *Socialism and Religion*, *On the Attitude of the Workers' Party to Religion*, *Class and Party Attitude to Religion and the Church*, as well as the article *Religion and the Church in the Soviet Union* from the Soviet Encyclopedia. *Selected Essays on the Question of Religion* includes Engels's discussions on the question of religion, the second article by Lenin in the above-mentioned book, Stalin's view on the Party's attitude toward religion, the American Communist Party leader Foster's *The Decline of Religion* (excerpted from *The End of World Capitalism*), Rong Mengyuan's *Examples of American Imperialism's Use of Religion to Invade China*, as well as special articles by comrades Wu Liping, Ai Siqi, Mitin, Fedorov, Zou Taofen, and others.

    Engels's discussions are excerpted from two sections of *Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy* and *Anti-Dühring*, focusing on explaining the origin of religion. How does religion originate? This is the basic starting point of the Marxist-Leninist policy on religion. Engels pointed out that religious belief is primarily the result of people's underdeveloped productive forces, and thus surrendering to the forces of nature. For example, the idea of "relying on heaven for food" among Chinese farmers is because rainfall and climate have a great impact on backward agriculture. The more primitive the agriculture, the less defensive capacity it has, and therefore it is illusory to think that there are gods in the sky who are in control, and that abundant harvests can be obtained by begging for the blessings of the gods. Secondly, due to the very unstable fate of people in class society, workers live in poverty and are often threatened by hunger, unemployment, injury, and disease. Farmers are oppressed by rents, taxes, corvée labor, officials, and landlords, and are constantly in danger of bankruptcy, family ruin, and selling their children. Even the petty bourgeoisie are often persecuted in life and even in life itself due to the exploitation of the ruling class, fascist tyranny, and the inevitable deterioration of socio-economic conditions under the capitalist system, feeling the sorrow of having no belonging. Regarding these, people cannot recognize their social causes, nor can they find solutions, so they have no choice but to place their hope in the protection of the gods. Therefore, Engels said that religious ideas are nothing but a fantastic reflection in the minds of people of those powers which dominate their daily lives and which they cannot understand.

    In addition to elaborating on Engels's views, Lenin's first two articles explain in detail the role of religion in society and the correct policy of the workers' party towards religion.

    Lenin pointed out that in a society ruled by the exploiting classes, religion is unfortunately used as a tool to oppress the people. Because the earliest religion, of course, reflected the hopes of the oppressed people in their painful lives, but it was very weak, hoping to avoid the painful fate of being oppressed through an abstract preaching of good, and looking forward to the happiness of heaven and the afterlife (the so-called "cultivate the next life rather than this life" and the like). The exploiting classes took advantage of this and used money and political power to cultivate and manipulate religion, consciously instilling in the people the lessons of enduring the painful life of this world, enduring the oppression of the exploiting classes in order to obtain heavenly rewards. For example, the reactionary religious rulers in imperialist countries, some of whom also admit that it is unreasonable for workers to suffer, but oppose workers rising up to fight for the overthrow of this unreasonable society. Take the facts we have witnessed and experienced, the people's revolutionary movement under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party has suffered all kinds of sabotage and abuse from spies like Lei Mingyuan, hypocrites like Stuart, and traitors like Yu Bin—they defend the evil rule of imperialism and reactionaries in oppressing the Chinese people, teach the reactionary ruling class to make some cheap charitable donations, and paralyze the people's awareness of uniting to fight for the transformation of society. The activities of these few religious scoundrels are the misfortune of the people and the misfortune of religion.

    How imperialists, under the guise of religious hypocrisy, deceive the people, deceive the masses of believers, and commit crimes against the Chinese people, against the Soviet Union, and against the people's democratic countries, are fully and factually described in the articles of Foster, Rong Mengyuan, and others.

    However, despite the fact that imperialists have used religion to carry out their various unforgivable crimes, it cannot be said that Marxists-Leninists should oppose religious belief in general. Engels and Lenin's articles both point out that since religion is the result of socio-economic conditions in which people are unable to conquer nature and unable to control and transform society due to low productive forces, then before these socio-economic conditions are fundamentally changed, religion will always have its traditional mass base, and it will only be possible to make religion lose its basis for existence after gradually realizing social, political and economic reforms, and even after building an infinitely beautiful communist society; that is to say, only after a happy paradise is realized on earth can the masses be prevented from fantasizing about the empty heaven in the sky.

    Based on this scientific understanding, Lenin pointed out: do not confuse the differences between Marxism-Leninism and religion, and never deal with the religious question abstractly or idealistically. He firmly opposed the petty bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie's rash declaration of abolishing religion, and the fanaticism and conspiracies against religion (the bourgeoisie in some countries sometimes deliberately create anti-religious struggles in order to provoke class unity between religious and non-religious workers). Lenin said: it is necessary to look at the problem from the "class division," rather than from the "religious division." That is to say, what is important is to strive for the revolutionary unity of the masses of the people: "This unity of the oppressed classes in the real revolutionary struggle to create a paradise on earth seems to us more important than unity of proletarian opinion on paradise in heaven."

    Therefore, freedom of religious belief is the consistent proposition of the Marxist-Leninist party. Only by adhering to this can religious and non-religious people be more closely united. Lenin emphasized: "We demand that religion be a private matter as far as the state is concerned… The state should not be involved in religion, and religious groups should not be linked to the regime. Anyone should be completely free to believe in any religion, or not to recognize any religion, that is, to become an atheist. There should be no difference between citizens in terms of their civil rights related to religious belief. Even in formal documents (referring to the government's record of citizens' identity—translator), any record of a certain citizen's belief should be unconditionally canceled. …Religious groups should become a completely free civil alliance of like-minded people unrelated to the regime. Only by implementing these demands to the end can the shameful and cursed history be ended..."

    Lenin said this in 1905, more than ten years before the October Revolution. Lenin opposed the mixing of religion and political power, so that the struggle of the revolutionary people against the reactionary regime would not involve the religious question. The reactionary ruling class often uses various powers to support religion, forcing belief in one religion, and even persecuting another, attempting to use religion to eliminate people's will to struggle in society, divert the line of sight of social struggle, and undermine political unity among the people.

    Marxist-Leninists advocate that religion should be a purely a matter of belief. The article *Religion and the Church in the Soviet Union* explained that the Soviet Union adhered to the principle of freedom of belief, separating the church from state affairs and school administration. Religion can neither be forced to disbelief, nor can it be forced to believe, otherwise it will inevitably cause disputes due to religion that are harmful to the unity of the country and the people. Article 124 of the Soviet Constitution stipulates: "In order to ensure the freedom of belief of citizens, the separation of church and state and the separation of schools and church are implemented in the Soviet Union. All citizens are recognized to have the freedom to hold religious ceremonies and the freedom of anti-religious propaganda." In order to protect freedom of belief, the Soviet Union has also taken many practical measures, such as establishing state religious affairs departments to provide appropriate assistance to legitimate church activities, and so on.

    The Soviet government does not interfere in all religious activities within the church, and at the same time requires the church not to interfere in state affairs, here strictly treating religion as a matter of ideological belief. As for the right of citizens to participate in political activities, then religious and non-religious people are completely equal, and there are strict provisions in the law to protect the political rights of religious people, and no discrimination is allowed. The state protects the legitimate civic interests of all people, including religious people.

    Lenin pointed out that since religion is a private matter as far as the state is concerned, that is to say, people's belief or disbelief in religion cannot be forced, therefore, it is necessary to resolutely oppose the adoption of administrative measures to oppress and prohibit religion, which can only ineffectively harm the people's will to freedom of belief, hurt the feelings of self-esteem of religious people, and hinder the people's unity and national construction.

    But Lenin also pointed out: "Religion is not a private matter as far as the socialist proletarian party is concerned. Our party is an alliance of conscious, advanced fighters for the liberation of the working class." The Marxist-Leninist party is a fighting team built on the scientific foundation of materialism. It must use the scientific laws of natural and social development as a scientific way of thinking to transform nature and society to educate and lead party members, form the strongest force for social progress, and educate and lead all the people to strive forward on the correct path. This is beneficial to the interests of all the people in the country. Therefore, Lenin and Stalin both emphasized that it is necessary to correctly carry out the propaganda of natural science and social science ideas and knowledge in order to achieve the complete victory of the socialist materialist world view. But this kind of propaganda is only to strive for the conscious and voluntary progress of people, and it must never be interpreted as being able to use any coercive means.

    Of course, the principle of freedom of belief cannot be interpreted as allowing reactionary religious elements to use religion to carry out activities that undermine the country and oppose the people. The government must deal with these appropriately. This treatment absolutely does not have any meaning of opposing religion, but only opposes those few political saboteurs who infringe upon the interests of the entire people, including the interests of religious people. These saboteurs are the common enemies of all religious and non-religious people. The article *Religion and the Church in the Soviet Union* quoted a sentence from Archbishop Sergius of the Russian Orthodox Church in his book *The Truth About Religion in Russia* to illustrate how the Soviet Union implemented this policy. He pointed out that certain religious scoundrels were sanctioned for carrying out counter-revolutionary work under the cover of robes and churches, which were all political litigations and had nothing to do with the purely church work of religious groups and religious personnel.

    In countries where the people's revolution has been victorious, such as the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries, because the reactionary ruling class has been overthrown, the connection between religion and the reactionary regime has been basically severed, and the people can begin to consciously conquer the forces of nature, and the people's living conditions can begin to gradually rise according to the will and efforts of the people. That is to say, it is possible to improve oneself through one's own hard work without being bound by blind social forces. The cause of national construction is absorbing the broad masses of the people day by day, and the ideal realm of heaven is gradually being realized from the battles on earth. In this way, religion will inevitably undergo new changes. Foster spoke very well on this point: "Religion does not necessarily have to die with the capitalist system. Most—if not all—religions, including the various denominations of Christianity, will most likely continue to survive in socialist society... This has been proven in the church experience of socialist Soviet Union. And it has also been proven in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe that are moving towards socialism... The churches are showing a certain ability to adapt themselves to socialist conditions... In China, many Christian denominations maintained by money from other countries, in the face of the miraculous progress of communism, are also beginning to transform themselves to suit the deeply changed social conditions." What kind of changes should religion have in order to adapt to this new social situation? That is, religion must be closely linked with the broad masses of religious people and cut off its ties with imperialism and reactionaries. Under the increasingly invigorated patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of religious people and the resolute will to build the people's country, religion must contribute to this construction cause, help religious people to fight for this construction cause, and realize the ideal of heaven through battles on earth, otherwise religion will inevitably be separated from the masses and become more lifeless. As Foster said: "Religion must no longer be a tool of reactionary politics, otherwise it will encounter the wrath of the people."

    In fact, we see that in China, in the Soviet Union, in other countries, and even in countries ruled by reactionaries, there are an increasing number of religious figures, because they have more or less contact with the broad masses of religious people, and therefore discovered that the great struggle ideal of the Communists is consistent with the heaven hoped for by religion, and that the Communists' firm progress and hard work spirit are a model for mankind, so they strive to lead the religious masses to unite with all the people, oppose imperialism, fascism, oppose war, and fight for the progress of world peace, democracy, and construction.

    The article *Religion and the Church in the Soviet Union* narrated how, in the early days of the October Revolution, the Soviet Orthodox Church colluded with imperialists to carry out subversive and destructive activities against the Soviet revolution, but "the success of Soviet construction, which was caused by the enthusiasm of the broadest masses of the people, convinced the most progressive and forward-looking religious people that all measures of the Soviet government were aimed at the happiness of the people, and the people unanimously supported these measures. They clearly saw and understood that continuing the struggle against the Soviet government could completely separate the upper echelons of the church from the people. The opinions of the people could not be ignored, and the church was collapsing, becoming a group of 'shepherds without sheep'." "These religious people came to a conclusion that the church should stop fighting against the Soviet government and stand on the position of loyalty to the Soviet government." For example, as early as 1927, Archbishop Sergius of the Orthodox Church and other members of the Church Affairs Council issued a declaration stating: "We do not need to show in words, but in fact, that not only those who are indifferent to the Orthodox Church, not only those who betray the Orthodox Church, but also the most enthusiastic Orthodox converts can become loyal citizens who are loyal to the Soviet regime. … We are willing to be Orthodox Christians, and at the same time we are willing to consciously feel that the Soviet Union is our motherland. The happiness and success of the motherland is our happiness and success, and the failure of the motherland is our failure. We are still Orthodox Christians, and we must remember that our obligation is not only due to responsibility, but also to be Soviet citizens according to our faith."

    The development of this patriotic movement in the Soviet religious community has made great contributions to the country. In the anti-German fascist war, Sergius stipulated from the first day of the anti-German war that participation in the anti-German war was the "sacred and natural obligation of every Christian." The Soviet Union and all of its other churches unanimously and resolutely supported and assisted the Soviet government, opposed the German fascists' attempt to use the church to achieve the purpose of invading and stealing the Soviet Union, and launched extensive patriotic activities, demonstrating their patriotic power to support the Soviet people.

    From the two books introduced here, the basic views of Marxism-Leninism on the religious question can be found in the Marxist-Leninist classics, and the reasonable attitude of socialist countries and people's democratic countries towards the religious question can also be found in the religious policy that the Soviet Union had long implemented and is still implementing. Undoubtedly, this will completely clarify the malicious propaganda of imperialism. Chinese believers are embarking on the road of innovation, and will undoubtedly show their patriotic power to support the interests of the motherland with more facts, thus creating great patriotic achievements.

　　两本马列主义论宗教的书

    九月二十三日，各报载有中国基督教界人士吴耀宗、邓裕志、赵紫宸、刘良模、涂羽卿等一千五百余人签名发表的宣言，题目是“中国基督教在新中国建设中努力的途径”，本报当日又发表了“基督教人士的爱国运动”的社论，指出：“我们相信全国人民当与全国大多数爱国的基督教徒一样，对这篇宣言表示热忱的欢迎。”
    诚如宣言中所说的：“基督教传到中国不久以后，帝国主义便在中国开始活动，又因为把基督教传到中国来的人们，主要地都是从这些帝国主义国家来的，基督教同帝国主义，便在有意无意、有形无形之中发生了关系。现在中国的革命胜利了。帝国主义对中国历史这一个空前的事实，是不会甘心的。它们一定要用尽千方百计，企图破坏这个既成的事实；它们也会利用基督教，去进行它们挑拨离间，企图在中国制造反动力量的阴谋。”因此，中国的爱国的基督教徒这次及时提出的拥护共同纲领，反对帝国主义、封建主义及官僚资本主义，为建设一个独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新中国而奋斗的任务，在杜绝帝国主义者利用宗教侵略中国上，和促进全国宗教人民与非宗教人民的团结一致共同努力上，是有很大的意义的。它既然是有利于国家和人民的利益的，自然应该得到人民的热烈赞助。
    在这里，研究一下马列主义对宗教的完整的看法，是十分必要的，因为我们对于宗教界爱国运动的重视，正是基于对宗教问题的明确认识而来。
    这里介绍的两本书就是足以帮助读者来领会这一点的。《社会主义与宗教》这个小册子包括列宁的三篇文章：《社会主义与宗教》、《论工人政党对宗教的态度》、《与宗教和教会有关的阶级和政党》，以及苏联大百科全书中的《苏联的宗教和教会》一文。《宗教问题选辑》包括恩格斯对宗教问题的一些论述、上述一书中列宁的第二篇文章、斯大林论党对宗教的态度、美共主席福斯特的《宗教的衰微》（这是摘自《世界资本主义的末日》一书中的一部分）、荣孟源的《美帝利用宗教侵华举例》，以及吴黎平、艾思奇、米丁、费奥陀洛夫、邹韬奋等同志的专文。
    恩格斯的论述摘自《费尔巴哈与德国古典哲学的终结》、《反杜林论》中的两节，着重在说明宗教的起源问题。宗教是怎样产生的呢？这是马列主义对宗教的政策的基本出发点。恩格斯指出宗教信仰第一是由于人们生产力还不发达，因而对自然的力量屈服的结果。例如我国一般农民的“靠天吃饭”思想，就是因为雨水气候对于落后的农业影响十分大，越是原始的农业越没有防御的能力，因此就幻想着天上有什么神在主宰着，可以由乞求神的保佑而得到丰饶的收成。第二是由于在阶级社会中，人们的命运十分不固定，工人们生活在贫困中，还经常有饥饿、失业、受伤、疾病等威胁，农民受租税、赋役、官吏、地主的压迫，不义战争的灾难，随时有破产、破家、卖儿卖女的危险，就是中小资产阶级，也常因统治阶级的剥削、法西斯暴政和资本主义制度社会不可避免的社会经济情况的恶化，生活乃至生命常受着迫害，感到没有归宿的悲哀。对于这些，人们不能去认识其社会的原因，也不能得到解决的方法，于是也就只好去寄希望于神的庇护了。所以恩格斯说宗教思想不是别的，乃是支配着人们日常生活而人们又不能去认识的那种力量，用神秘的形式在人们头脑中幻想的反映。
    列宁的前两篇文章，除了发挥恩格斯的意见之外，还详细说明了宗教在社会中的作用和工人政党对宗教的正确政策。
    列宁指出在剥削阶级占统治的社会中，宗教不幸地被利用作压迫人民的工具。因为最初的宗教，固然是反映着被压迫的人民在痛苦的生活中的希望，但却是很无力的，希望用一种抽象的善的说教来避免被压迫的痛苦命运，以及企望着天堂和来世的幸福（所谓“不修今世修来世”之类）。剥削阶级利用了这一点，就用金钱与政权力量来培养和操纵宗教，有意识地向人民灌输忍受现世的痛苦生活、忍受剥削阶级压迫以获得天国报偿的教训。例如，帝国主义国家中反动的宗教统治者，他们当中有的也承认工人受痛苦是不合理的，但却反对工人起来为推翻这个不合理的社会而斗争。就拿我们所曾目击身经的事实来说，中国共产党领导下的人民革命运动，就曾受着象雷鸣远那样的间谍、司徒雷登那样的伪善者、于斌那样的卖国贼的种种破坏和辱骂，——他们维护帝国主义和反动派压迫中国人民的罪恶统治，教导反动统治阶级作一些廉价的慈善布施，麻痹人民团结起来为改造社会而斗争的意识。这少数宗教败类的活动，是人民的不幸，也是宗教的不幸。
    帝国主义者怎样在宗教伪善的面具下，进行欺骗人民，欺骗教徒群众，反对中国人民，反对苏联，反对人民民主国家的罪行，在福斯特、荣孟源等的文章中，都有着充分的和事实的叙述。
    但是，尽管帝国主义者这么样利用了宗教来进行它们的种种不可饶恕的罪行，却决不可以说马列主义者应该笼统地反对宗教信仰。恩格斯和列宁的文章都指出：既然宗教是人们在生产力低下，无力征服自然和无力支配、改造社会那种社会经济条件下产生的结果，那末，在这种社会经济条件没有根本改变以前，宗教是始终有其传统的群众基础的，必须在逐步实现社会政治经济的改革中，以至建成共产主义的无限美好的社会之后，才能使宗教失去其存在的基础；就是说，只有在人间实现了美满的乐园之后，才能使群众不去幻想天上的空虚的天国。
    基于以上这种科学的理解，列宁指出：既不要混淆马列主义与宗教的有所不同，也决不要抽象地、唯心论地来处理宗教问题。他坚决反对小资产阶级和资产阶级轻率宣布废除宗教、反对宗教的狂想和阴谋（某些国家中的资产阶级有时故意制造反宗教斗争，以挑拨信教的与不信教的工人的阶级团结）。列宁说：必须从“阶级的分野”来看问题，而不能从“宗教的分野”来看问题。这就是说，重要的是必须争取人民群众的革命团结：“被压迫阶级为创造地上的乐园而进行的这种真正的革命斗争之团结一致，在我们看来，比无产阶级关于天上的乐园的意见之团结一致，更为重要。”
    因此，宗教信仰自由乃是马列主义党的一贯的主张，只有坚持实行这一点，才能使宗教人民与非宗教人民更亲密地团结起来。列宁着重强调：“我们要求宗教对国家而言是一种私事，……国家不应当跟宗教发生关系，宗教团体不应当和政权联系起来。任何人应当完全自由地信仰任何宗教，或不承认任何宗教，亦即成为一个无神论者。任何一个社会主义者通常是一个无神论者。在公民间，在有关宗教信仰的公民权利方面，完全不允许有任何轩轾。即在正式的文件里（指政府关于公民的身份记载——引用者），也应当无条件地取消关于某种公民信仰的任何记载。……宗教团体应当成为一种完全自由的、与政权无关的意见相同者的公民同盟。只有把这些要求执行到底，才能终结那种可耻的和可咒诅的历史……………”
    列宁这话是在一九○五年即十月革命前十几年讲的。列宁反对宗教与政权混合为一，以便使革命的人民反对反动政权的斗争不致牵涉到宗教问题上。反动统治阶级则常常是用种种政权力量来支持宗教，强迫信仰一种宗教，甚至迫害另一种宗教，企图用宗教消灭人们社会斗争的意志，转移社会斗争的视线，破坏人民间的政治团结。
    马列主义者主张宗教应是纯粹信仰问题，《苏联的宗教与教会》一文中，说明了苏联坚持信教自由，使教会与国家事务与学校行政分离的原则，宗教既不可以强迫不信仰，也不可以强迫信仰，否则必将因宗教而引起有害于国家和人民的团结的纠纷，苏联宪法一百二十四条就如此规定着：“为保证公民的信仰自由，在苏联实行教会与国家分离和学校与教会分离。承认一切公民有举行宗教仪式的自由和反宗教宣传的自由。”为了保护信仰自由，苏联还采取了许多实际措施，例如成立国家的宗教事务部门，予正当教会活动以适当的协助等等。
    苏联政府不干涉教会内部的一切信教活动，同时也要求教会不得干涉国家事务，这里是严格的把宗教当作思想信仰问题看待的。至于公民参加政治活动的权利，那么宗教徒与非宗教徒是完全平等的，在法律上有严格保障宗教徒政治权利的规定，不许有任何歧视，国家是保护一切人民，包括宗教徒的正当公民利益的。
    列宁指出：既然宗教对国家而言是一种私事，就是说，人们信不信宗教，是不可以强迫的，因此，就必须坚决反对对宗教采取压迫和禁止的行政办法，这只能无效果地伤害人民信仰自由的意志，伤害宗教徒自尊的感情，妨碍人民的团结和国家的建设。
    但列宁又指出：“宗教对社会主义的无产阶级政党而言，却不是私事。我们的党是自觉的、先进的战士为争取工人阶级的解放的同盟”。马列主义的党是建立在科学的唯物论基础上的战斗队伍，它必须以自然与社会发展的科学规律，为实现自然与社会改造的科学的思想方法去教育和领导党员，形成社会进步的最坚实的力量，以教育和领导全体人民向正确的道路上奋进。这是有利于全国一切人民的利益的。因此，列宁和斯大林都强调指出，必须正确进行传布自然科学和社会科学的思想、知识的宣传，以求得社会主义唯物世界观的彻底胜利。但这种宣传，只是争取人们自觉自愿的进步，而决不可以解释为能够用任何强制手段的。
    当然，信仰自由的原则，也决不可以解释为能够容许反动的宗教分子利用宗教来作破坏国家、反对人民的活动，对这些，政府是必须予以适如其分的处理的。这种处理，绝对不存在任何反对宗教的意义，而只是反对那种侵害全体人民利益包括宗教徒利益的少数政治破坏者。这种破坏者，是一切宗教与非宗教人民的公敌。“苏联的宗教与教会”一文中曾引用了苏联正教教会总主教谢尔基在“俄国宗教真相”一书中的一句话，来说明苏联怎样执行这一政策的。他指出某些宗教败类在僧衣和教会掩护下进行反革命工作因而受到制裁，都是政治性的讼事，跟宗教团体和宗教人员的纯粹的教会工作，是决没有牵涉之处的。
    在人民革命已经得到胜利的国家，如苏联、中国，以及各人民民主国家，由于反动统治阶级被打倒，宗教与反动政权的联系基本上被切断了，人民已经可以开始自觉地征服自然力量，人民生活情况开始可以按照人民的意志与努力逐步上升，就是说，已经可以由自己的辛勤努力而提高自己，不受盲目的社会力量的束缚了。国家的建设事业，一天一天吸收着广大人民群众，天国的理想境界在逐步地从地上的战斗中实现了。这样，宗教就必然要发生新的变化。福斯特对这一点讲得很好：“宗教并不是必需随着资本主义制度而死亡。大多数——如果不是全体——的宗教，包括基督教的各宗派，将有很大的可能要继续生存在社会主义社会中……这一点，已在社会主义苏联的教会经验中证明了。并且在正在走向社会主义的中东欧诸国中也证明了这一点。……教会正在表示出某种能力使他们本身适合于社会主义条件……在中国，许多由其他国家出钱维持着的基督教派，面对着共产主义之奇迹似的前进，也正在开始改造自己，以适合深深改变了的社会条件。”宗教为了适合这种新的社会情况，应该有怎样的改变呢？那就是必须使宗教与广大宗教群众亲密地联系起来，而割断其与帝国主义及反动派的联系。在广大宗教群众日益振奋的爱国主义热情和建设人民国家的坚毅意志之下，宗教必须有助于这种建设事业，帮助宗教徒为这种建设事业而奋斗，用地上的战斗去实现天国的理想，否则宗教必然要脱离群众而更加无生气。诚如福斯特所说：“宗教必须不再是反动政治的工具，否则就要遇到人民的愤怒。”
    事实上，我们看到，在中国、在苏联、在其他国家，甚至在反动派统治的国家中，已经有着日益众多的宗教界人士，由于他们和宗教的广大善良群众有着或多或少的联系，因而发现了共产党人的伟大斗争理想是和宗教企望的天国一致的，而共产党人的坚定进步、刻苦奋斗的精神足为人类的楷模，因此就努力领导宗教群众，和全体人民团结一致，反对帝国主义、法西斯主义，反对战争，为世界和平、民主、建设的进步而奋斗。
    《苏联的宗教与教会》一文中，曾叙述了十月革命初期，苏联正教怎样与帝国主义者勾结，进行颠覆苏联革命的破坏活动，但是，“苏维埃建设的成功，它是被最广大的人民大众的热情所造成的，使最进步的和最具远见的宗教家确信苏维埃政府的一切措施是以人民的幸福为方针的，而人民又是一致拥护这些措施的。他们明确地见到了、了解了：继续反对苏维埃政府的斗争能使教会的上层分子完全脱离人民，人民的意见不能不加以重视，教会正在崩溃，变成一团‘无可牧的牧师’。”“这些宗教家就得到了一个结论，就是教会应当停止跟苏维埃政府斗争，并站在忠于苏维埃政府的立场。”例如远在一九二七年，正教总主教谢尔基和教会宗务院其他人员一起发表了一个宣言，申明：“我们不需要在口头上，而需要在事实上表现，不仅漠视正教的人，不仅背叛正教的人，而且最热心的正教皈依者也能成为效忠于苏维埃政权的忠实公民。……我们愿意做一个正教徒，同时也愿意自觉到苏联就是我们的祖国。祖国的快乐和成功就是我们的快乐和成功，祖国的失败就是我们的失败。我们依然是正教徒，我们要记住自己的义务是不仅由于责任，而且根据信仰来做一个苏联公民。”
    苏联宗教界这一爱国运动的发展，对国家是有着伟大的贡献的。在反对德国法西斯战争中，谢尔基从抗战第一日起，就规定参加抗德战争是“每一个基督徒的神圣的和当然的义务”。苏联其它的几及全部的教会都一致坚决支持和援助苏联政府，反对德国法西斯企图利用教会达到侵略盗窃苏联的目的，展开了广大的爱国活动，表现了他们拥护苏维埃人民的爱国主义力量。
    从这里所介绍的两本书中，可以从马列主义的经典著作里找到马列主义对宗教问题的基本看法，也可以从苏联所早已实行并还在实行的宗教政策上找到社会主义国家和人民民主国家对宗教问题的合理态度，无疑这都将对帝国主义的恶毒宣传予以彻底澄清。中国的教徒正在走上革新的道路，也无疑将以更多的事实表现他们拥护祖国利益的爱国主义力量，因而创造伟大的爱国功绩来。
