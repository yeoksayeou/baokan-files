Editor's Note: The second edition of the "Great Soviet Encyclopedia," compiled and printed by the State Scientific Publishing Bureau of the Soviet Union, published its first volume on December 15, 1949. This article is an interpretation of the word "Agitation" (Агитаμия) in the book. It is translated here for the reference of comrades in propaganda work.

Agitation is a political activity whose purpose is to spread certain ideas and slogans to influence the consciousness and emotions of the broad masses. Agitation is an important means of political struggle for classes and political parties. The means of agitation include: newspapers and periodicals (newspapers, pamphlets, leaflets, appeals, etc.), oral speeches (reports, talks, reading newspapers, etc.), radio broadcasts, films, and plastic arts (propaganda posters, charts, cartoons, etc.).

The political agitation of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) is one of the powerful means to provide communist education to the workers and to enhance their socialist consciousness. Bolshevik agitation united the masses around the party of Lenin and Stalin. Agitation is to clarify the policies of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Soviet government, to popularize the national economic plan, and to mobilize the masses to victoriously complete the task of building a communist society. Lenin once defined political agitation as "the 'focus' where the pressing interests of the proletariat's political education coincide with the pressing interests of the entire social development and all the people" ("Lenin Collected Works," Russian edition, Fourth Edition, Volume 5, page 314).

During the construction years of the Bolshevik Party, agitation linked the Party with the mass workers' movement, promoting the integration of socialist theory with the workers' movement. The Bolshevik Party's agitation among the masses played a huge role in preparing and carrying out the three Russian revolutions, in achieving the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, in crushing armed interventionists and White bandits, in building Soviet socialism, and in crushing fascist Germany and imperialist Japan.

When speaking of the Bolshevik Party's political and ideological work, Lenin pointed out that it has three forms: first, theoretical activity; second, propaganda; and third, agitation. A common task faces theorists, propagandists, and agitators alike - to cultivate the communist consciousness of the people. However, they complete this task using different methods. Lenin wrote, when analyzing the activities of propagandists and agitators under the Tsarist autocracy: "For example, when a propagandist talks about the issue of unemployment, he should explain the capitalist nature of the crisis, point out the reasons why the crisis inevitably occurs in the current society, and explain the need to transform the current society into a socialist society, etc. In a word, he should provide 'many ideas,' so many that only a few people (relatively speaking) can fully understand them all at once. When an agitator talks about this issue, he only cites the examples that are most familiar and most prominent to the entire audience, such as the starvation of a certain unemployed worker's family, the increase in poverty, etc., and strives to use the well-known facts to give the 'masses' an idea, that is, the contradictory situation that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer is completely unreasonable, and strives to arouse the masses' dissatisfaction and indignation towards this extremely unfair situation" ("Lenin Collected Works," Russian edition, Fourth Edition, Volume 5, page 380). Lenin distinguished these elements of political and ideological work, while also pointing out their unity, because they are directed towards the same goal - arousing the mass movement under the direction of the Party.

The basic characteristic of Bolshevik agitation is its high degree of ideology. Lenin said: without clear and well-considered ideological content, agitation degenerates into empty talk, and "correct theoretical decisions guarantee solid achievements in agitation" ("Lenin Collected Works," Russian edition, Fourth Edition, Volume 6, page 449).

Bolshevik agitation pays attention to current and pressing issues. The mission of agitators in cities and villages is to reflect current events in Soviet and foreign life. Agitators constantly remind citizens of their sacred duty to defend the socialist motherland. Agitators explain to Soviet citizens their great rights and obligations stipulated in the "Stalin Constitution," call on the working people to tirelessly enhance the power of the socialist country, participate in socialist competition, and improve labor productivity, and explain that all of this is ultimately the most important and principal thing for the victory of the new social system. Agitation is a means to educate the working people in the spirit of carefully treating socialist public property (as if it were sacred and inviolable). Agitators explain the Soviet Union's foreign policy and its tireless struggle for lasting peace and democracy against the instigators of new wars, pointing out the growth and strength of democracy and socialism on the international stage. An indispensable component of Bolshevik agitation is to educate citizens in the spirit of Soviet patriotism, in the love for their own motherland, and in national pride for the socialist motherland and their own people.

Bolshevik agitation is truthful. When evaluating the agitation work during the years of the civil war, Lenin said: "The White bandits wrote in all their tabloids: the Bolshevik agitation is excellent, they spend money without stinting on agitation. But the people have heard all kinds of agitation - the White bandits' agitation, the Constitutionalists' agitation. It would be ridiculous to think that the people follow the Bolsheviks because their agitation is more skillful. No, the problem is that their agitation is truthful" ("Lenin Collected Works," Russian edition, Third Edition, Volume 25, pages 14-15). Only the Communist Party always speaks to the people straightforwardly and openly about all the difficulties and dangers to be overcome. When the Hitler German bandit army treacherously attacked our country, Stalin declared to all the Soviet people, Red Army and Navy soldiers in his historically significant radio address on July 3, 1941: "Our motherland is in a serious danger. ... We must make our Soviet people thoroughly understand the profound danger threatening our country, and resolutely abandon the mentality of complacency and indifference, and abandon the mood of peaceful construction" (Stalin, "On the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union," Russian edition, Fifth Edition, 1947, pages 9 and 13). Stalin's speech played a huge role in mobilizing the Soviet people and their armed forces to defeat the German fascist aggressors. Kalinin said in a conversation with frontline agitators in April 1943: agitators should be honest. "Don't exaggerate to the soldiers, but tell the truth, don't be afraid to point out the difficult situation" (Kalinin, "On Political Agitation," 1948, page 29).

The characteristic of Bolshevik agitation is clarity and simplicity. Lenin taught: every propagandist and agitator should "be good at speaking simply and clearly in a language that the masses can understand, resolutely abandon those difficult terms like heavy artillery, foreign words, memorized, ready-made slogans, definitions, conclusions, etc. that the masses do not understand and do not know" ("Lenin Collected Works," Russian edition, Fourth Edition, Volume 11, page 262). It is well known that general rhetoric and "profound" expressions cannot penetrate the hearts of the audience, cannot touch their pain points, and excessive application of foreign words will distort the Russian language and the languages of other Soviet nationalities, hindering the audience from better understanding the content of the agitator's speech. Kalinin once said: language is everything to an agitator.

Political agitation among the broad masses of working people should adopt different methods considering the development level of the audience and readers. "One cannot speak in the same way at a mass meeting in a factory and in a Cossack village, at a meeting of university students and in a peasant's cottage, on the podium of the Third Duma and in the pages of a foreign newspaper. The skill of any propagandist and any agitator lies in: influencing the audience in front of them in the best way, making the well-known truths as convincing as possible, as easy to understand as possible, as clear and impressive as possible to the audience" ("Lenin Collected Works," Russian edition, Fourth Edition, Volume 17, page 304).

All of Lenin and Stalin's speeches are examples of these characteristics: exceptional clarity, simplicity, and ideological richness. Lenin and Stalin's speeches and essays are permeated with a deep conviction in the righteousness of the historical cause realized by the Bolshevik Party. "Very great persuasive power, simple and clear arguments, short and easy-to-understand sentences, without a trace of affectation, without playing any dizzying gestures, without using a single sentence of deliberately stimulating words, - all of this makes Lenin's speeches ten thousand times higher than the speeches of ordinary 'parliamentary' orators," - Stalin said ("Stalin Collected Works," Russian edition, Volume 6, page 55). These invaluable qualities are also inherent in Stalin's speeches. Henri Barbusse said in his book "Stalin": "Stalin, like Lenin, attracts the audience with the content of his speeches, convinces the audience and deeply moves the audience, and these speeches still retain all their grandeur, all the logic of their structure after they are printed. ... Its power lies in its unparalleled sound thinking, broad knowledge, amazing internal rigor, love of clarity, and strict consistency" (Barbusse, "Stalin," translated from French, Second Edition, Moscow, 1936, pages 67-68 and 352).

The strength of Bolshevik agitation lies in its purposefulness, concreteness, and effectiveness. Lenin required the Party's agitators and propagandists to be good at linking the general tasks of the revolutionary struggle with concrete local tasks and facts, and to carry out political agitation purposefully. Agitation should arouse the working people to solve economic tasks. "We should link the masses with the construction of general economic life. ... This should be the main and basic thing in the work of every propagandist and agitator, and when he understands this himself, the victory of his work will be guaranteed" ("Lenin Collected Works," Russian edition, Third Edition, Volume 25, page 456).

Bolshevik agitation achieves practical results because it is not limited to calling for action, but is supported by organizational work. The agitator's words should never be inconsistent with his actions. For example, if an agitator calls for a high degree of production discipline and a high degree of labor productivity in a factory, he himself should be an advanced worker and set an example of highly productive work.

Bolshevik agitation has a fighting and offensive nature. Stalin said: agitation is not only persuasion, but also exposure. The purpose of political agitation is to oppose the remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness, to oppose the encroachment on socialist property, to oppose violations of labor discipline, to oppose kowtowing to foreign countries, and to oppose the hostile attacks of alien elements. Agitators do not shy away from sharp questions, dare to reveal mistakes, expose the petty-bourgeois laxity and indiscipline, and criticize shortcomings. "One can memorize the basic knowledge of communism," - Kirov said, - "but if it is not engraved in your heart, - there will be no results, you will be a eulogist of communism, not a fighter. If you want to be a vigorous communist fighter, - you should rise up with all Bolshevik anger against those shortcomings that hinder our construction" (Kirov, "Essays and Speeches," 1934, page 91).

The content of Bolshevik agitation changes in different historical stages along with the tasks facing the Party. In the dark years of Tsarist autocracy, the political agitation of the Bolshevik Party aimed at spreading the ideas of socialism and class struggle. Agitators aroused the political dissatisfaction of workers and peasants with the existing system, and called on workers and peasants to wage an active revolutionary struggle against the autocracy and overthrow the Tsar. After the overthrow of the autocratic regime, the Bolshevik Party prepared for the socialist revolution, focusing its political agitation on isolating and exposing the anti-people and counter-revolutionary essence of various petty-bourgeois parties - the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, striving to win over and attract millions of working people to its side. Agitation at that time played a huge role in organizing workers and peasants to overthrow the bourgeois provisional government and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat.

After the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Party paid great attention to the issue of political agitation. In December 1917, when enemies threatened Petrograd, Lenin suggested strengthening the troops and implementing emergency measures to defend the capital. In the draft resolution of the People's Committee on this issue, the issue of agitation occupied an extremely important position: "(1) Strengthen the agitation against German annexationism. (2) Expend additional funds for this agitation work" ("Lenin Collected Works," Russian edition, Third Edition, Volume 20, page 363).

During the era of the civil war, when the young and unconsolidated Soviet Republic was engaged in a bloody struggle against domestic counter-revolution and foreign armed intervention, the Party carried out large-scale political agitation. Lenin and Stalin spoke at mass meetings and conferences of workers, peasants, and Red Army soldiers. The created agitation trains and agitation ships were led by famous Communist Party and Soviet state activists such as Molotov and Kalinin. In the pages of Pravda and other newspapers, the Party passionately called on workers and peasants, mobilizing them to quickly crush the White bandits and armed interventionists.

After the victorious end of the civil war, the Party used agitation to direct the efforts of the Soviet people to rapidly restore industry and transportation, expand the sown area, and increase crop yields. The Twelfth Party Congress (1923) pointed out in its decision on propaganda and agitation: agitation in the hands of the Party remains a powerful weapon to systematically and widely explain the political and economic measures of the Soviet regime and all the outstanding events in domestic and international life to the working masses. With the recovery of the national economy, the direction of the Bolshevik Party's political agitation was to mobilize the masses to realize the socialist industrialization of our country, the industrialization and collectivization of agriculture, to realize the Stalin Five-Year Plans, to build a socialist society, to strengthen our national defense power, and to consolidate the Soviet state. The scale of the Bolshevik Party's agitation was very grand during the election of representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (1937) and the Supreme Soviets of the various Union and Autonomous Republics (1938). At that time, many non-Party Bolsheviks were also widely attracted to political agitation.

During the years of the Great Patriotic War, the Bolshevik Party launched political work among the masses, mobilizing the strength of the Soviet people to support the front in every way, consolidating the indomitable spirit of the people and armed forces of the Soviet state, consolidating their unwavering fighting will and confidence in the righteousness of their cause. During the years of the Great Patriotic War, Bolshevik agitators, under the leadership of the Party organization, carried out huge rear work - in factories, in collective farms and state farms, they called on the workers of cities and villages to supply the front with more weapons and food. The Bolshevik Party's appeal - "Everything for the front, everything for victory!" - was the most popular among the people. The direction of political agitation during the Patriotic War was to explain to the working people the profound content of the speeches and orders of the Supreme Commander of the Soviet Armed Forces Stalin, and to explain the appeals of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the reports of the Soviet Information Bureau. Stalin's speeches played an inestimable role in the history of the Great Patriotic War. These speeches were the program of combat action for the entire Soviet people. Agitators told the people and the soldiers of the Soviet Army and Navy about the situation on the front of the Great Patriotic War, current events at home, and the international status of the Soviet Union. In their reports and talks, agitators consolidated the Soviet people's love for their motherland and hatred for the fascist aggressors, they called on the soldiers of the Soviet Army and Navy to quickly and completely crush the enemy.

After the Great Patriotic War, the Party's political agitation mainly focused on completing and exceeding the post-war Five-Year Plan, realizing the great Stalin plan to transform nature, striving for new prosperity in economy and culture, and further consolidating the power of our great motherland. During the election of representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (1946) and the Supreme Soviets of the various Union and Autonomous Republics and the local Soviets (1947), political agitation reached the entire people, and played a significant role in the victory of the alliance between Communist Party members and non-Party members.

The quality, purposefulness, and effectiveness of political agitation largely depend on the cadre of agitators. The Party organization selects and trains agitators. In order to better organize agitation work among the masses, agitators are unified in agitation groups established by the Party's grassroots organizations. In villages without Party organizations, agitation groups are directly organized by the Party's District Committee (here the District Committee is equivalent to the County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the same below. - Translator). In the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee's "Decision on the Shortcomings in the Stalingrad Party Organization's Leadership of Agitators' Work and its Improvement Methods" (1947), it is stipulated that the secretary of the grassroots organization is obliged to personally lead the work of the agitation group. The agitation groups established by the Party's District Committee in places without Party organizations are led by All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) members sent from the District Center organization to the Party activists' meeting. The leader of the agitation group is approved by the Standing Committee of the Party's District Committee. The agitation group carries out its work according to the plan discussed at the Party meeting.

Political agitation, like other means of political and ideological work of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), has its own forms and methods. Newspapers and periodicals carry out huge agitation work. According to Stalin's definition, newspapers and periodicals are "the sharpest and most powerful weapon of our Party". The Bolshevik newspapers and periodicals have greatly increased: the Soviet Union publishes 7,200 kinds of newspapers (May 1949), with a total circulation of 31 million copies. Tens of thousands of wall newspapers are also published in enterprises, collective farms, organs, and schools.

The main forms of oral agitation are reports and speeches at meetings, group discussions and individual talks, collective newspaper reading, etc. If it is necessary to quickly inform the workers of major events in domestic life, mass meetings of workers are convened in enterprises and collective farms. Sometimes meetings are convened to discuss reports on the current situation, on the international situation, and on the economic tasks of enterprises, collective farms, state farms, machine tractor stations, etc. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) tasked the Party organizations to hold a meeting of workers in every enterprise and collective farm at least once every one and a half months to report on current political events. The secretaries and Standing Committee members of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) District Committee, Provincial Committee, and Border Region Committee, the chairmen of the Executive Committees of the Workers' Representatives Soviets, the secretaries of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League District Committee and Provincial Committee, and the leading staff members of the Party, Youth League, and Soviet organs, should make reports at the meetings. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) suggested that the Party's Provincial Committee and District Committee absorb the most cultured part of the intellectuals to make political reports and speeches.

Agitators systematically conduct talks among the working people. "Fewer gatherings and mass meetings," - Lenin said, - "we need individual agitation. ... Every conscious male and female worker should use every free day and hour to do individual agitation" ("Lenin Collected Works," Russian edition, Third Edition, Volume 24, pages 261 and 262). The talks should be conducted in the form of group discussions and individual talks. We must attract Communist Party members, Youth League members, and the outstanding part of the workers and collective farm members to participate in the discussions. Stalin said: ordinary peasants are often "outstanding agitators for the collective farm movement, because they can find arguments in favor of collective farms that are understandable and acceptable to other peasant masses, which our experienced Bolsheviks cannot even dream of" ("Stalin Collected Works," Russian edition, Volume 12, page 334).

A widely popular form of political agitation among residents is collective reading of newspapers and literary works. Newspaper reading is combined with discussion of what is read.

Powerful means of carrying out political work among residents are radio broadcasts and films. The Soviet Union's radio broadcasts and films are the disseminators of Bolshevik ideas. Radio broadcasts can quickly transmit the decisions of the Party and the government, major news, and documents to the residents. Stalin described the characteristics of film as "the greatest means of mass agitation" ("Stalin Collected Works," Russian edition, Volume 6, page 217).

Visual agitation has a huge impact on people's consciousness. Its main forms are propaganda posters and leaflets; index cards for completing plans, honor boards popularizing advanced figures and their working methods; exhibitions publicizing the achievements of enterprises, collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations; charts indicating the quotas completed by competitors; and mobile red flags awarded to outstanding work teams, groups, workers, collective farm members, tractor drivers, etc.

Visual agitation promotes the further development of socialist competition. In many enterprises and collective farms, the achievements of Stakhanovite workers are immediately known to all workers, staff members, and male and female collective farm members with the help of leaflets - "lightning." The enterprise's exhibition clearly shows the rationalized working methods of Stakhanovite workers, and methods of saving raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity. Regular exhibitions of production achievements are usually held in clubs, cultural palaces, and red corners.

Stalin wrote: "Agitation is always and everywhere one of the main tools of the Party" ("Stalin Collected Works," Russian edition, Volume 1, page 274). Therefore, the decisions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) give great attention to the issue of political agitation.

During the years of the Great Patriotic War, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) made the following decisions: "On Organizing Political Reports for Party and Soviet Staff Workers for Rural Residents", "On Improving the Situation and Methods of Mass Political Ideological Work in the Tatar Party Organization", "On the Recent Tasks of the Belarusian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Organization in Carrying out Mass Political Work and Cultural Education Work among Residents", etc. In March 1946, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) adopted the decision on how the Party organization should carry out propaganda and agitation work due to the "Five-Year Plan Bill for the Restoration and Development of the Soviet National Economy in 1946-1950". In this decision, a program for carrying out propaganda and agitation work is provided - explaining the great post-war work plan to the workers and mobilizing the Soviet people to realize the post-war Five-Year Plan. The February Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (1947) gave great attention to mass political work among rural residents, and the meeting discussed the issue of improving agriculture in the post-war period. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)'s "Decision on the Shortcomings in the Stalingrad Party Organization's Leadership of Agitators' Work and its Improvement Methods" (1947) helped all Party organizations improve the leadership of mass agitation work and improve the ideological level of this work. In the period of gradually transitioning from socialism to communism, the socialist consciousness of the working masses has a decisive role. The speed of the Soviet Union's movement towards communism depends on the achievements of communist education. Therefore, the Party strengthens political agitation in every way, considering it to be one of the most important means of educating the working masses in the communist spirit and mobilizing them to realize the historical tasks facing the Party, the Soviet state, and the entire people.

The Youth League and the trade union organizations, together with the Party organizations and under their leadership, also carry out agitation work. The Youth League's agitation work primarily lies in the youth, but the Youth League members also actively participate in the agitation work carried out by the Party organization among all the working people, especially during the election campaign period. In villages and collective farms without Party organizations, the grassroots organizations of the Youth League launch agitation work. The trade union organization uses agitation as a means to widely attract workers and staff members to participate in socialist competition, popularize the achievements of advanced producers, and collect rationalization proposals for improving labor productivity and saving raw materials, fuel, and materials, etc.

The Communist and Workers' Parties of the People's Democratic countries use the experience of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to carry out huge agitation work among the working people. The direction of political agitation of the Communist and Workers' Parties is to expose the instigators of the imperialist aggressive wars and their running dogs, further strengthen the anti-imperialist democratic camp, further consolidate friendship with the Soviet Union, complete the people's economic plan, and launch the socialist competition of the working people. Political agitation is the weapon for fighting for the construction of a socialist society.

In capitalist countries, in the arsenal of the imperialist bourgeoisie, agitation is a supplement to the means by which the state influences the masses (police, courts, prisons, etc.), and its purpose is to consolidate and expand the rule of the bourgeoisie and the oppression of the working people. The bourgeois parties and governments own thoroughly bought-out newspapers, control printing houses, paper, films, radio broadcasts, lecture halls, etc., and spread lies among workers and peasants every day. The imperialist bourgeoisie does not hesitate to use the most despicable means to ideologically create public opinion, deceive the people, and corrupt them. In the United States, Britain, and other capitalist countries, the agitation of the reactionary bourgeoisie is used to oppose the Soviet Union, to oppose the People's Democratic countries, to oppose the Communist Party, progressive organizations of the people, and the advanced workers of science, culture, and art who are fighting for peace and democracy.

The Anglo-American imperialists are launching the ideological preparation for a new aggressive war. The imperialist aggressors are striving to destroy the will of the freedom-loving peoples of all nationalities to resist the infringement of Anglo-American imperialism on national autonomy and national freedom with absurd and hatred-filled agitation and propaganda.

The direction of political agitation of the Communist Parties in various capitalist countries is to carry out revolutionary education among the working class and the working masses in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism. The Communist Party's agitation is to call on everyone to fight against fascism and reactionaries, against the capitalist system, and against the instigators of new imperialist wars. The Communist Party's agitation is to encourage the masses to fight for lasting peace, for people's democracy, and for socialism.

The Communist Party's agitation in capitalist countries plays a huge mobilizing role and organizational role in uniting the ranks of the international workers' movement and establishing a lasting unity of the working class. It is against the ideological preparation for new wars, against the aggressors' deception of the working masses, and against the outrageous lies and slander against the Soviet Union and the various People's Democratic countries. The Communist Party must make the propaganda of aggressive wars carried out by the imperialists and the agitation for racial hatred and national hostility be severely rejected and firmly condemned by the entire democratic public opinion and the broad masses of working people. The Communist Party's agitation is to raise the level of mass political consciousness, and to fight against the right-wing social democratic traitors of the working class, who are covering up their betrayal with pseudo-socialist and cosmopolitan rhetoric. The Communist Party's political agitation is to expose the nationalist Tito clique that acts as an imperialist special agent, which has fled to the sinister enemy camp of peace, the camp of imperialism and fascism.

The resolution of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties held in Hungary in the second half of November 1949 pointed out: "The results of the great struggle for peace will largely depend on the energy and initiative of the Communist Parties; to turn the possibility of destroying the plans of the instigators of war into reality will first depend on the Communists as advanced fighters". This is the purpose of the Communist Party's political agitation.

　　论鼓动
    编者按：苏联国家科学出版局编印的《苏联大百科全书》第二版，于一九四九年十二月十五日出版了第一卷。本文系该书“鼓动”（Агитаμия）一词的诠释。兹特译出，作为宣传工作同志们的参考。
    鼓动是一种政治活动，其目的是在于传播一定的思想和口号去影响广大群众的意识和情绪。鼓动是阶级和政党政治斗争的重要手段。鼓动的手段有：报刊（报纸、小册子、传单、号召等等）、口头言论（报告、谈话、读报等等）、无线电广播、电影、造形艺术（宣传画、图表、漫画等等）。
    联共（布）的政治鼓动是给劳动者以共产主义教育、提高他们的社会主义觉悟的强有力的手段之一。布尔什维克的鼓动把群众团结在列宁——斯大林的党周围。鼓动是阐明联共（布）和苏维埃政府的政策，通俗地说明国民经济计划并动员群众去胜利地完成共产主义社会建设的任务。列宁曾经给政治鼓动下了一个定义，说它是“无产阶级政治教育的迫切利益与整个社会发展和全体人民的迫切利益相重合的‘焦点’”（《列宁全集》，俄文本，第四版，第五卷，第三一四页）。
    在布尔什维克党的建设年代中，鼓动把党和群众性工人运动联系起来，促进社会主义理论与工人运动的结合。布尔什维克党在群众中的鼓动，在准备和实行俄国三次革命方面、在取得伟大十月社会主义革命胜利方面、在粉碎武装干涉者和白匪方面、在建设苏联社会主义方面、在粉碎法西斯德国和帝国主义日本方面，曾经起了巨大的作用。
    列宁在说到布尔什维克党的政治思想工作时，指出了它有三种：第一，理论活动，第二，宣传，第三，鼓动。不论在理论家、宣传员和鼓动员面前都摆着一个共同的任务——培养人民的共产主义觉悟。但他们是以各不相同的方法来完成这个任务。列宁在分析沙皇专制条件下宣传员和鼓动员的活动时写道：“譬如宣传员讲到失业问题的时候，就应当解释危机的资本主义本性，指出危机在现社会中必然发生之原因，说明必须把现社会改造为社会主义社会等等。一句话，他应当提供“很多观念”，多到只有少数人（比较上说）才能一下子尽都领会，通统领会。而鼓动员讲到这个问题时，却只举出全体听众所最熟悉和最显著的例子，譬如某某失业工人家属饿死，贫困增加等等，并竭力利用人所共知的这件事实来给予“群众”一个观念、即富者愈富和贫者愈贫的矛盾情形是毫不合理的这个观念，力求激起群众对这种极不公平的情形的不满和愤恨”（《列宁全集》，俄文本，第四版，第五卷，第三八○页）。列宁区别了政治思想工作的这些要素，同时又指出了它们统一的地方，因为它们是导向同一个目的——在党所指示的方向下唤起群众运动。
    布尔什维克鼓动的基本特点是其高度的思想性。列宁说：没有明白和深思熟虑的思想内容，鼓动就堕落为空谈，而“正确的理论上的决定则保证鼓动中的牢固的成绩”（《列宁全集》，俄文本，第四版，第六卷，第四四九页）。
    布尔什维克的鼓动是注意当前迫切的问题，城市和乡村鼓动员的使命是反映苏联和国外生活中当前的事件。鼓动员经常提醒公民们保卫社会主义祖国的神圣义务。鼓动员向苏联公民解释《斯大林宪法》中所规定的他们的伟大权利和义务，号召劳动人民毫不疲倦地增强社会主义国家的威力、参加社会主义竞赛、提高劳动生产率，并且说明这一切归根到底对于新社会制度的胜利是最重要和最主要的事情。鼓动是以慎重对待社会主义公共财产（如同对待神圣不可侵犯的东西一样）的精神来教育劳动人民的手段。鼓动员解释苏联的对外政策及其争取持久和平与民主而反对新战争挑拨者的毫不倦怠的斗争，指出民主和社会主义的力量在国际舞台上的增长和强大。布尔什维克鼓动所不可缺少的组成要素是以苏维埃爱国主义的精神、以对待自己祖国的热爱及对社会主义祖国和本国人民的民族自豪来教育公民。
    布尔什维克的鼓动是真实的。列宁在评价国内战争年代的鼓动工作时说道：“白匪在他们所有的小报上都写道：布尔什维克的鼓动是很出色的，他们不惜金钱进行鼓动。但是人民听到过各种各样的鼓动——白匪的鼓动，立宪分子的鼓动。认为人民跟着布尔什维克走是因为他们的鼓动更有技巧，那就可笑了。不，问题是在于他们的鼓动是真实的”（《列宁全集》，俄文本，第三版，第廿五卷，第一四——一五页）。只有共产党才总是率直和公开地向人民说到所要克服的一切困难和危险。当希特勒德国匪军背信弃义向我国进攻的时候，斯大林在一九四一年七月三日所作的具有历史意义的广播演说中向全体苏联人民、红军和海军战士们宣称道：“我们祖国已处在严重的危险关头。……必须使我们苏联人彻底了解威胁我国的深刻危险，而坚决放弃泰然自若、漠不关心的心理，放弃和平建设的情绪”（斯大林，《论苏联伟大卫国战争》，俄文本，第五版，一九四七年，第九页和第一三页）。斯大林的演说在动员苏联人民及其武装部队击溃德国法西斯侵略者方面曾经起了巨大的作用。加里宁在一九四三年四月与前线鼓动员的谈话中说道：鼓动员应当是老老实实的。“不要向战士们说得天花乱坠，而应说出真情实况，不要害怕指明困难情形”（加里宁，《论政治鼓动》，一九四八年，第二九页）。
    布尔什维克鼓动的特点是明白、简单。列宁教导道：每一个宣传员和鼓动员应当“善于用群众所能了解的语言说得简单明白，坚决抛弃那些像重炮队一样的难懂的术语，外国字，背熟的、现成的、但群众不懂、不知道的口号、定义、结论等等”（《列宁全集》，俄文本，第四版，第十一卷，第二六二页）。大家知道，一般的辞藻与“深奥的”表述不能打入听众的心坎，不能触到他们的痛处，过度地应用外来语就会歪曲俄罗斯语言和苏联其他各民族的语言，妨碍听众更好地了解鼓动员讲话的内容。加里宁曾经说道：语言对鼓动员就是一切。
    在广大劳动群众中间的政治鼓动应当考虑到听众与读者的发展水平而采取各不相同的方法。“在工厂群众大会上与哥萨克村庄里，在大学生会议上与农民草舍中，在第三届杜马的讲台上与国外机关报的篇幅上，不能说成一个样子。任何宣传员与任何鼓动员的技巧是在于：要以最好的方式影响面前的听众，将众所周知的真理对听众讲得尽可能地令人信服，尽可能地容易领会，尽可能地明白清楚和印象深刻”（《列宁全集》，俄文本，第四版，第十七卷，第三○四页）。
    列宁与斯大林的一切言论是异常明晰、朴素和思想充实这些特点的范例。列宁与斯大林的演说和论文渗透着对于布尔什维克党所实现的历史事业的正义性的深刻的确信。“非常大的说服力量，简单明了的论据，简短通俗的语句，没有半点矫揉造作的色彩，不玩半点令人昏眩的手势，不用半句故意刺激听众的辞藻，——所有这一切使得列宁的演说比通常‘国会’演说家的演说高出万万”，——斯大林说（《斯大林全集》，俄文本，第六卷，第五五页）。这些不可估价的特质也是斯大林的演说所固有的。享利·巴比塞在《斯大林》一书中说道：“斯大林与列宁相同，以其演说的内容吸引听众，说服听众并深深感动听众，这些演说印出来之后也还保存着它的全部宏伟、它的全部结构的逻辑。……它的力量是在于它的无比的健全思想，广博的知识，令人惊讶的内在的严整，对明确性的热爱，严格的首尾一贯”（巴比塞，《斯大林》，译自法文，第二版，莫斯科，一九三六年，第六七——六八和三五二页）。
    布尔什维克鼓动的力量是在于它有目的，具体，有效。列宁要求党的鼓动员和宣传员要善于把革命斗争的一般任务和具体的地方任务与事实联系起来，要有目的地进行政治鼓动。鼓动应当唤起劳动人民去解决经济任务。“应当使群众与一般经济生活的建设联系起来。……这应当是每个宣传员和鼓动员工作中主要和基本的东西，当他自己领会了这点，他的工作的胜利就会有保证”（《列宁全集》，俄文本，第三版，第廿五卷，第四五六页）。
    布尔什维克鼓动之所以得到实际的结果，是因为它不只限于号召行动，而是被组织工作支持着。鼓动员的言论任何时候都不应当与行为不一致。例如，鼓动员要在工厂里号召高度的生产纪律与高度的劳动生产率，他自己就应当成为先进者，做高度生产工作的榜样。
    布尔什维克的鼓动带有战斗的、进攻的性质。斯大林说：鼓动不仅是劝说，而且是揭露。政治鼓动的目的是反对人们意识中的资本主义残余，反对侵吞社会主义财产，反对违反劳动纪律，反对向外国奴颜屈膝，反对异己分子的敌意袭击。鼓动员不逃避尖锐的问题，敢于揭示错误，揭发小资产阶级的散漫性与无纪律性，斥责缺点。“可以背熟共产主义的起码知识，——基洛夫说，——但是如果它没有刻在你的心上，——那是不会有什么结果的，你将是共产主义的歌颂者，而不是战士。如果你想做生气勃勃的共产主义战士，——你就应当以全部布尔什维克的愤怒奋起反对那些阻碍我们建设的缺点”（基洛夫，《论文与演说》，一九三四年，第九一页）。
    布尔什维克鼓动的内容在各个不同的历史阶段上是随着党面前的任务而改变的。在沙皇专制的黑暗年代中，布尔什维克党的政治鼓动是以传播社会主义和阶级斗争的思想为目的。鼓动员激起工农群众对现存制度的政治不满，号召工人和农民与专制制度作积极的革命斗争，推翻沙皇。在专制政体推翻之后，布尔什维克党准备社会主义革命，把自己的政治鼓动集中于孤立与揭露各个小资产阶级政党——孟什维克和社会革命党人的反人民、反革命的本质，争取并吸引千百万劳动群众到自己方面来。鼓动当时在组织工农推翻资产阶级临时政府和建立无产阶级专政方面起了巨大的作用。
    在伟大十月社会主义革命胜利以后，党对于政治鼓动问题给予了巨大的注意。一九一七年十二月，当敌人威胁着彼得格勒的时候，列宁建议加强部队与实行保卫首都的紧急措施。在人民委员会对这个问题的决议草案中，鼓动问题占有一个极重要的地位：“（一）加强反对德国人并吞主义的鼓动。（二）支出额外款项作这一鼓动工作”（《列宁全集》，俄文本，第三版，第二十卷，第三六三页）。
    在国内战争时代，当年青的和不巩固的苏维埃共和国进行着反对国内反革命与外国武装干涉的流血斗争时，党进行了大规模的政治鼓动。列宁与斯大林在工人、农民和红军战士的群众大会和会议上演说。创造出来的鼓动火车、鼓动轮船是由莫洛托夫、加里宁这样著名的共产党和苏维埃国家的活动家所率领。在真理报及其他报纸的篇幅上，党热忱地号召工人和农民，动员他们极迅速地粉碎白匪和武装干涉者。
    在国内战争胜利结束以后，党借助鼓动使苏联人民的努力用于极迅速地恢复工业和运输、扩大播种面积、提高农作物的收获量。第十二次党代表大会（一九二三年）在其关于宣传和鼓动的决定中指出道：在党手中的鼓动依然是有计划地和广泛地向劳动群众阐明苏维埃政权的政治、经济措施与国内、国际生活中一切特出事件的强大武器。随着国民经济的恢复，布尔什维克党政治鼓动的方针是动员群众实现我国社会主义工业化、农业的工业化和集体化，实现斯大林五年计划，建设社会主义社会，加强我国国防威力与巩固苏维埃国家。在选举苏联最高苏维埃（一九三七年）与各联盟共和国和自治共和国最高苏维埃（一九三八年）的代表时，布尔什维克党鼓动的规模是很宏大的。当时许多非党的布尔什维克也广泛地被吸引到政治鼓动中来了。
    在伟大卫国战争的年代中，布尔什维克党在群众中展开政治工作，动员苏联人民的力量以一切方法支援前线，巩固苏维埃国家人民与武装部队坚忍不拔的精神，巩固他们毫不动摇的战斗意志和对自己事业正义性的信心。在伟大卫国战争的年代中，布尔什维克鼓动员在党组织的领导下进行了巨大的后方工作——在工厂中，在集体农庄和国营农庄中，他们号召城市和乡村的劳动者供给前线更多的武器和粮食。布尔什维克党的号召——“一切为了前线，一切为了胜利！”——在人民中间是最孚众望的。卫国战争时期政治鼓动的方针是向劳动人民阐明苏联武装部队最高统帅斯大林的演说和命令的深刻内容，阐明联共（布）中央的号召和苏联情报局的报导。斯大林的演说在伟大卫国战争历史中起了不可估量的作用。这些演说是全苏联人民的战斗行动纲领。鼓动员向人民和苏联陆海军战士讲述伟大卫国战争前线的形势、国内当前的事件和苏联的国际地位。鼓动员在自己的报告和谈话中巩固了苏联人民对祖国的热爱以及对法西斯侵略者的憎恨，他们号召苏联陆海军战士们极迅速和彻底地粉碎敌人。
    伟大卫国战争以后，党的政治鼓动主要注意于完成和超过战后的五年计划，实现伟大的斯大林改造自然的计划，争取经济和文化新的繁荣，进一步巩固我们伟大祖国的威力。在选举苏联最高苏维埃（一九四六年）与各联盟共和国和自治共和国最高苏维埃及各地方苏维埃（一九四七年）的代表时，政治鼓动遍及了全体人民，并且在共产党员与非党员的联盟取得胜利方面起了重大的作用。
    政治鼓动的素质、其目的性和有效性，大半是取决于鼓动员干部。党组织挑选和培养鼓动员。为了更好地组织群众中的鼓动工作，鼓动员就统一在党基层组织所建立的鼓动团体中。在没有党组织的村庄中，鼓动团体直接由党的区委（这里的区委相当于中国共产党的县委，以下也一样。——译者）来组织。在联共（布）中央《关于斯大林格勒党组织领导鼓动员工作的缺点及其改进办法》的决定（一九四七年）中，规定基层组织的书记有义务亲自领导鼓动团体的工作。在没有党组织的地方而由党的区委所建立的鼓动团体，是由党的区委从区中心组织派遣到党的积极分子会议中的联共（布）党员来领导。鼓动团体的领导者由党的区委常委会所批准。鼓动团体按照党的会议上所讨论的计划来进行工作。
    政治鼓动，像联共（布）其他政治思想工作手段一样，有它自己的形式和方法。报刊进行着巨大的鼓动工作，按照斯大林的定义，报刊是“我们党最尖锐和最强有力的武器”。布尔什维克的报刊大大增长了：苏联出版七千二百种报纸（一九四九年五月），共发行三千一百万份。在企业、集体农庄、机关、学校中还刊出几万种墙报。
    口头鼓动的主要形式是会议上的报告和讲话、小组座谈和个别谈话、集体读报等等。如果需要很快使劳动者知道国内生活中的重大事件，就在企业和集体农庄中召集劳动者的群众大会。有时召集会议来讨论关于当前时局、关于国际形势以及关于企业、集体农庄、国营农庄、机器拖拉机站等等的经济任务的报告。联共（布）中央责成党组织在每一个企业和集体农庄中一个月至一个半月至少举行一次劳动者的大会，报告目前的政治事件。联共（布）区委、省委、边区委的书记和常委委员，劳动者代表苏维埃执行委员会主席，全苏列宁共青团区委和省委的书记以及党、共青团和苏维埃的机关的领导工作人员，都应当在会议上作报告。联共（布）中央建议党的省委和区委吸收最有修养的一部分知识分子来作政治报告和讲话。
    鼓动员在劳动人民中间有系统地进行谈话。“少一些集会和群众大会，——列宁说，——需要个人的鼓动。……每个觉悟的男女工人应当利用每一个空闲的日子和钟点去作个人鼓动”（《列宁全集》，俄文本，第三版，第廿四卷，第二六一和二六二页）。谈话应当以小组座谈和个别谈话的形式来进行。必须吸引共产党员、共青团员与优秀的一部分工人和集体农庄庄员来座谈。斯大林说：普通的农民往往“是集体农庄运动特出的鼓动员，因为他们找得到有利于集体农庄的论据，这些论据是其他农民群众所能了解和接受的，我们老练的布尔什维克却梦想不到”（《斯大林全集》，俄文本，第十二卷，第三三四页）。
    在居民中间广泛流行的政治鼓动形式是集体读报和读文学作品。读报是与座谈所读的东西结合起来的。
    在居民中间进行政治工作的强有力的手段是无线电广播和电影。苏联的无线电广播和电影是布尔什维克思想的传播者。无线电广播可以使党和政府的决定、主要的消息和文件很快传达到居民中间。斯大林描述电影的特征是“最伟大的群众鼓动手段”（《斯大林全集》，俄文本，第六卷，第二一七页）。
    诉诸眼睛的鼓动对于人们的意识具有着巨大的影响力量。它的主要形式是宣传画和传单；完成计划的指标牌，普及先进人物及其工作方法的荣誉牌；宣传企业、集体农庄、国营农庄、机器拖拉机站的成绩的展览会；标示竞赛者所完成的定额的图表；授予优秀的工作队、小组、工人、集体农庄庄员、拖拉机手等等的流动红旗。
    诉诸眼睛的鼓动促使社会主义竞赛进一步的发展。在许多企业和集体农庄中，借助传单——“闪电”——就使斯达哈诺夫工作者的成绩立刻为全体工人、职员和男女集体农庄庄员所知道。企业的展览会一目了然地表明了斯达哈诺夫工作者的合理化的工作方法，节省原料、材料、燃料、电力的方法。生产成绩的经常展览普通都在俱乐部、文化宫、红角举行。
    斯大林写道：“鼓动随时随地是党的主要工具之一”（《斯大林全集》，俄文本，第一卷，第二七四页）。因此，联共（布）中央的决议中给予政治鼓动问题以巨大的注意。
    在伟大卫国战争的年代中，联共（布）中央作了下列的各个决定：《关于为农村居民组织党和苏维埃工作人员的政治报告》，《关于在鞑靼党组织中改进群众政治思想工作的状况和办法》，《关于白俄罗斯共产党（布）组织在居民中间进行群众政治工作和文化教育工作方面的最近任务》等等。一九四六年三月，联共（布）中央通过了由于“一九四六——一九五○年恢复与发展苏联国民经济的五年计划法案”而党组织应当如何进行宣传鼓动工作的决定。在这个决定中，提供了开展宣传鼓动工作的纲领——向劳动者解释战后的伟大工作计划并动员苏联人民实现战后的五年计划。联共（布）中央二月全会（一九四七年）对于农村居民中间的群众政治工作给予了巨大的注意，会上讨论了战后时期提高农业的措施问题。联共（布）中央《关于斯大林格勒党组织领导鼓动员工作的缺点及其改进方法》的决定（一九四七年），帮助了一切党组织改进对群众鼓动工作的领导，提高这一工作的思想水平。在从社会主义渐次过渡到共产主义的时期中，劳动群众的社会主义觉悟具有着决定性的作用。苏联走向共产主义运动的速度是取决于共产主义教育的成绩。因此，党以一切方法加强政治鼓动，认为这是以共产主义精神教育劳动群众并动员他们去实现党、苏维埃国家、全体人民面前的历史任务的极重要的手段之一。
    共青团和工会的组织，与党组织一起并在其领导下，也进行鼓动工作。共青团的鼓动工作首先是在于青年，但共青团员同时也积极地参加党组织在一切劳动人民中间所进行的鼓动工作，特别是在选举运动的时期。在没有党组织的村庄和集体农庄中，共青团的下层组织就展开鼓动工作。工会组织利用鼓动这个手段广泛地吸引工人和职员参加社会主义竞赛，普及生产先进者的成绩，收集关于提高劳动生产率和节省原料、燃料、材料等等的合理化建议。
    人民民主国家的共产党和工人党利用联共（布）的经验，在劳动人民中间进行巨大的鼓动工作。共产党与工人党政治鼓动的方针是揭发帝国主义侵略战争的挑拨者及其走狗，进一步增强反帝国主义的民主阵营，更加巩固与苏联的友谊，完成人民经济计划及展开劳动人民的社会主义竞赛。政治鼓动是为建设社会主义社会而斗争的武器。
    在资本主义国家中、在帝国主义资产阶级的武库中，鼓动是国家影响群众的手段（警察、法庭、监狱等等）的补充，其目的是巩固和扩大资产阶级的统治与对劳动人民的压迫。资产阶级的政党和政府拥有着彻头彻尾被收买的报纸，掌握着印刷所、纸张、电影、无线电广播、讲演厅等等，每天都在工人和农民中间散播谎言。帝国主义资产阶级不惜以最卑劣的手段从思想上制造舆论，欺骗人民群众并使之堕落。在美国、英国及其他各资本主义国家中，反动资产阶级的鼓动是运用来反对苏联，反对各人民民主国家，反对共产党、人民群众的进步组织以及为和平与民主而战斗的先进的科学、文化与艺术的工作者。
    英美帝国主义者展开了新的侵略战争的思想准备。帝国主义侵略者竭力以谬妄和对人类仇恨的鼓动和宣传，来破坏爱好自由的各族人民的反抗英美帝国主义侵害民族自主和民族自由的意志。
    各资本主义国家中共产党政治鼓动的方针，是以马克思列宁主义的精神向工人阶级与劳动群众作革命的教育。共产党的鼓动是号召大家进行反对法西斯主义和反动派、反对资本主义制度、反对新的帝国主义战争的挑拨者的斗争。共产党的鼓动是鼓励群众进行争取持久和平、争取人民民主和社会主义的斗争。
    资本主义国家中共产党的鼓动在团结国际工人运动的队伍并建立工人阶级的持久的统一方面起着巨大的动员作用和组织作用。它是反对新战争的思想准备，反对侵略者对劳动群众的愚弄，反对对苏联和各个人民民主国家的放肆的撒谎和毁谤。共产党要使帝国主义者所进行的侵略战争的宣传以及对种族仇恨和民族敌视的鼓动遭到整个民主舆论与广大劳动群众严厉的拒绝和坚决的斥责。共产党的鼓动是提高群众政治觉悟的水平，与工人阶级的右派社会党叛徒作斗争，这些叛徒是以伪社会主义和世界主义的辞句来掩盖自己的背叛行为。共产党的政治鼓动是揭发作帝国主义特务的民族主义铁托集团，它曾经逃跑到和平的险恶敌人阵营中、帝国主义与法西斯主义的阵营中。
    一九四九年十一月下半月在匈牙利举行的共产党与工人党情报局会议的决议中指出道：“争取和平的如荼如火的巨大斗争的结果，大半将取决于共产党的精力和主动性；要把破坏战争挑拨者的计划的可能性变成现实，首先将取决于作为先进战士的共产党人”。这就是共产党政治鼓动的目的。
