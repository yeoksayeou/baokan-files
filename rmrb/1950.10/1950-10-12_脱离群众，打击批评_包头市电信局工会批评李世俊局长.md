　　Breaking Away from the Masses, Suppressing Criticism
　　Baotou City Telecommunications Bureau Union Criticizes Bureau Chief Li Shijun

To the Editor:

　　We are union cadres from the Baotou Telecommunications Bureau. Problems exist in our bureau's work that have not been resolved, seriously affecting the progress of work and the promotion of mass enthusiasm. The problem I am referring to is the dissatisfaction of the masses with the administrative leadership and the lack of unity between the administration and the union. The reason for this phenomenon is mainly that Bureau Chief Li Shijun has a bureaucratic style of breaking away from the masses and suppressing criticism.

　　Director Li has consistently disregarded the opinions of others. He often says, "I am the director, and I don't agree." Therefore, the masses feel that "it is very difficult to discuss things with the director." And Director Li is aware of this situation. He says, "Let them be dissatisfied, it doesn't matter."

　　Let me give you some examples. For instance, the technicians at the transmitting station work in three shifts. The night shift is from 6:00 PM to 8:30 AM the next morning; however, after midnight, all transmitting machines are shut down and stop working. Therefore, according to convention, they hope to be able to sleep after the machines are shut down (the security team is responsible for protecting the machines). According to the actual situation, there is no need for a duty officer after midnight, only a night watchman needs to be set up, or their request should be taken care of and given rest. The union reflected this opinion to the director, but Director Li said, "According to the principle of the eight-hour working system, sleeping is not allowed." He also said, "The union is reflecting this opinion is tailism." As a result, every technician was dissatisfied and said, "Why do we have to sit idle all night when we have no work?"

　　Director Li is quick-tempered and often scolds people. Most of the responsible personnel in various departments have been scolded by him. An engineering administrator almost cried once after being scolded.

　　Director Li has no plans in his work and often calls various unprepared temporary meetings, wasting a lot of time. For example, once, in order to discuss the issue of operator Ge Hongliang taking a day of sick leave, he summoned the responsible comrades of various departments, the chairman of the union, etc., and discussed it twice, taking a total of three or four hours.

　　In his leadership style, he only listens to reports and assigns tasks in the office; after assigning tasks, he does not organize inspections. For example, after announcing the regulation that night shift comrades are not allowed to sleep, he said, "I don't care whether they sleep or not, anyway, the administration has stipulated that sleeping is not allowed. If they sleep and something goes wrong, then they will be responsible, and the administration will have no responsibility."

　　Director Li adopted a rude attitude towards other people's criticisms, making subordinates afraid to offer opinions in a straightforward and serious manner. He often said that other people's criticisms were "not a matter of principle" and adopted an attitude of ignoring them. If someone made a wrong suggestion, he would attack the other party. He often said that people who had opinions about him were "starting from personal prejudices," "not obeying leadership," and "lacking organization and discipline," and therefore often retaliated against those who offered opinions. For example, when engineering administrator Li Yanchao made some suggestions, the director said at the meeting, "To be honest, you are not qualified to be an administrator." Several cadres who came with him were often attacked in front of the staff because they had made more suggestions to him, saying that they were incompetent and unqualified for leadership work.

　　In handling personnel matters, punishment and expulsion are more common than education and transformation. When employees make mistakes, he always adopts the method of expulsion, saying that "if a few are not expelled, the work cannot be done well." For example, when operator Wang Shihuan delayed answering a phone call once, Director Li wanted to "tell him to get out." From April to mid-September of this year, seven employees were dismissed or suspended for negligence, three employees were transferred for negligence, two were given major demerits, and four were prepared or had been prepared to be dismissed, totaling sixteen people, accounting for about 13% of the total number of employees. As a result, the general staff felt afraid.

　　The above facts have caused dissatisfaction and opposition among the masses towards the administrative leadership and have seriously affected the work enthusiasm and creativity of the staff.

　　The relationship between the administration and the union is also very abnormal. During the preparatory committee of the union, the masses reflected that "the union is the tail of the administration." The administration often took administrative opinions to the union to go through a formal procedure. Sometimes, the administration directly conveyed orders to the union group, or assigned work tasks to the group leader and summoned the group leader to report, etc. After the union was officially established, these phenomena have decreased, but still exist. Once, when the union committee was meeting, Director Li himself controlled the meeting and shouted and scolded, giving a bad impression. When the union reflected the opinions of the masses to Director Li, he said, "The masses have opinions because the union leadership is tailism and has not conducted ideological education for the employees. ——The work in the bureau is not going well, there are many problems, basically because the union leadership has problems."

　　Regarding the above issues, Director Li once explained, "My temperament is straightforward, and it is inevitable that people from petty-bourgeois backgrounds cannot stand it, causing their dissatisfaction." Obviously, this explanation, which avoids the important and dwells on the trivial, cannot solve the problem. Director Li also explained, "I came from the army, I am not used to this set, I will slowly learn to change!" However, if Director Li does not follow the mass line in his thinking, insists on bureaucratism, and does not thoroughly examine himself, it will not be beneficial to the work.

　　Because we have repeatedly expressed our opinions to Director Li, Director Li recently said to us, "Either you leave, or I leave." We ourselves have hoped to leave the Baotou Bureau. But we believe that: not expressing opinions to the leader and leaving the job is an irresponsible attitude towards the people and the country.

### 脱离群众，打击批评  包头市电信局工会批评李世俊局长

　　脱离群众，打击批评
    包头市电信局工会批评李世俊局长编辑同志：
    我们是包头电信局的工会干部。在我局的工作中存在着问题，一直得不到解决，严重地影响了工作的开展和群众积极性的发扬。我所说的问题就是群众对行政领导的不满和行政与工会不团结。产生这种现象的原因，主要是局长李世俊有脱离群众和打击批评的官僚主义作风。
    李局长对别人的意见一贯不加重视，他常说：“我是局长，我不答应。”因此群众都感觉到：“和局长商量事情很困难。”而李局长是知道这种情况的，他说：“不满让他们不满去吧，没有关系。”
    举些事实来说吧，譬如发讯台的机务员是三班轮值，夜班是下午六时至次晨八时半；而夜半十二时以后所有发讯机都已关闭，停止工作。因此他们按照惯例，希望在机器关闭后能够睡觉（保护机器的另有保卫队负责）。按实际情况，夜晚十二时以后不需要值机员，只须改设值夜员，或者照顾他们的要求，给以休息。工会就把这意见反映给局长，而李局长却说：“根据八小时工作制原则，不许睡觉。”并说：“工会反映这种意见，就是尾巴主义。”结果，每个机务员都不满意，说：“为什么我们在无工作时也要闲坐一夜呢？”
    李局长好发脾气，常常骂人。各部门的负责人员大部被他骂过，工务管理员有一次几乎被骂得哭起来。
    李局长在工作中没有计划，常常召开各种毫无准备的临时会议，浪费时间很多。举例说，有一次，为了讨论话务员葛鸿亮请一天病假的问题，他就把各部门的负责同志，工会主席等都找了来，讨论了二次，共费了三、四个小时。
    他在领导方式上，只是在办公室里听取汇报、布置任务；布置了任务以后，不去组织检查。例如他在宣布了夜班同志不许睡觉的规定以后，说：“他们睡不睡不去管他，反正行政上已规定了不许睡觉。要是他们睡了觉，出了乱子，那就该他们负责，行政上没有责任了。”
    李局长对于别人的批评，采取了粗暴的态度，使下级不敢再正面地严肃地提出意见来。他常说别人的批评“不是原则问题”而采取置之不理的态度。如有人提错了一点意见，就打击对方。他常说对他有意见的人，是“从私人成见出发”、“不服从领导”、“无组织无纪律”，因而常对提意见者打击报复。如工务管理员李雁朝提了一些意见，局长在会场上说：“老实说，你这管理员是不够资格的”。同来的几个干部因对他提的意见比较多，就常在工作人员前面打击他们，说他们没有能力，做领导工作不称职。
    在处理人事问题上，处分和开除多于教育和改造。职工犯了错误，总是采取开除的办法，说是“不开除几个，工作就不能搞好”。如话务员王世宦接电话迟延了一次，李局长就要“叫他滚蛋”。从本年四月到九月中，因过失而被开除或停职的职工有七人，因过失而调走的职工有三人，受到记大过处分的二人，准备或曾准备开除的有四人，共计十六人，占全体职工总数的百分之十三左右。因之，一般职工都感到害怕。
    以上各种事实，引起了群众对行政领导的不满和对立，并严重地影响了职工群众的工作积极性和创造性。
    行政和工会的关系，也很不正常。在工会筹委会时期，群众反映说：“工会是行政的尾巴。”而行政上常把行政意见拿到工会去作一个形式上的通过。有时候，行政上直接把命令传达给工会小组，或对小组长布置工作任务及召集小组长汇报等。工会正式成立以后，这类现象虽已减少，但仍旧存在。有一次，工会委员会开会时，李局长自己掌握了会场，而且大叫大骂，给人以不好的印象。工会把群众的意见，反映给李局长时，他说：“群众有意见，是因为工会领导上的尾巴主义，没有对职工进行思想教育。——局里工作搞不好，问题很多，基本上是因为工会领导有问题。”
    以上这些问题，李局长曾作过这样解释：“我的性情直率，难免使小资产阶级出身的人受不了，引起他们的不满。”显然，这种避重就轻的解释，并不能解决问题。李局长也曾这样解释：“我是从军队里来的，搞不惯这一套，我慢慢学着改罢！”但是，李局长在思想上不走群众路线，坚持着官僚主义，不彻底的检讨自己，对于工作是没有什么好处的。
    因为我们曾经多次向李局长提出意见，李局长最近对我们说：“不是你走，就是我走。”我们自己也曾希望过离开包头局。但是我们认为：对领导者有意见不提，以离职了事，乃是对人民对国家不负责任的态度。
