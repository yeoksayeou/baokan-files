　　The United States is the Culprit of Imperialist Aggression and Fascist Reaction
    — A Refutation of Truman's Speeches in San Francisco and New York
    Du Li
    Following Truman and MacArthur's conspiratorial meeting to expand the Pacific War of Aggression, Truman delivered speeches in San Francisco on October 18th and New York on October 24th. These two speeches used many deceptive and self-contradictory words, but their main purpose was to accelerate the armament of the United States, strengthen the war preparations of its capitalist vassal states, to further expand the war of aggression, and attempt to use war to deal with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.
    In order to realize its dream of dominating the world, American imperialism has adopted various methods of intimidation and deception to treat countries around the world. Under the annexation policy of American imperialism, many capitalist or colonial countries have been reduced to American dependencies, losing their territorial sovereignty and the independence and autonomy of their national internal affairs. However, the socialist and people's democratic countries, led by the Soviet Union, have adhered to the independent integrity of their national territorial sovereignty, and firmly grasped the banner of opposing aggression and defending a lasting and democratic peace in the world. American imperialism, seeing that it could neither deceive nor scare these countries, and could not suppress them, had no choice but to resort to force. The Korean War, which broke out on June 25, was the beginning of the American imperialist conspiracy to armed aggression against the people's democratic countries. Now Truman is clamoring about so-called "must be prepared to use force," and "must use strength to oppose strength," which means that American imperialism has decided to continue to use force to implement its dream of enslaving the whole world.
    In his San Francisco speech on October 18, Truman said: "We must continue to increase the strength of our armed forces—the Army, Navy, and Air Force. We must devote more of our resources to military uses and less to civilian consumption." "We are building our defenses with extreme seriousness and will not relax because of the victories in Korea." He also told his vassal states such as Britain and France in his New York radio broadcast on October 24: "Military forces must be provided when called upon" to carry out the American aggression plan.
    Listen to how brazenly the imperialist bandit is declaring his war resolution to the world! How he is opening war on the peaceful lives of the American and world's working people, asking everyone to tighten their belts to comply with the munition profits of the monopoly capitalists. How arrogant he is to declare that he will not relax "defenses" because of the "victory" in Korea! This means that the American imperialist desire for aggression is by no means limited to Korea, and Truman will definitely further extend the flames of aggression to the Chinese border!
    We have long seen clearly that American imperialism will never stop at invading one Korea. Invading Korea is only part of its plan to invade Asia and then conquer the world. The Chinese people have a very deep memory. Back then, Japanese imperialism invaded China, starting with the invasion of Korea and Taiwan, and then invading Northeast China and the inland. Today, American imperialism is copying Japan's old tricks, moving from Korea to Taiwan and then to the Northeast border. Can the Chinese people sit idly by and ignore this fact?
    Strangely, in these two speeches agitating for war, Truman, in addition to declaring his determination to expand the war of aggression, meaninglessly chewed on a large set of so-called "international cooperation," "peace," "democracy," and "no aggressive ambitions in the Far East or elsewhere," "sympathy" for the Asian people "and will assist them in achieving and defending their independence" and other nonsense. It seems that even war-mongers know a little bit that just talking about "using force" without talking about "international cooperation," or just talking about war without talking about "peace," is still not justifiable. This shows that the people of the world, all of Asia, and all of America do not want war and do not support the American imperialist war of aggression.
    Now let's take a look at what Truman's "international cooperation" is all about.
    "Today, people all over the world are pursuing a better life. They want to break free from the shackles and evils of the past, and they want to create their own destiny. These aspirations can be—without conflict and bloodshed—satisfied through the United Nations by means of international cooperation." That's right, today the Korean people are pursuing a free and independent life, they want to get rid of the evil rule of the American puppet Syngman Rhee gang, and they want to grasp their own destiny as masters of the country. But who, under the guise of the United Nations, gave the Korean people's sacred aspirations a bloody blow? As soon as the Korean civil war broke out, which country immediately barbarously and illegally "passed through the United Nations" to interfere in Korean internal affairs with "bloodshed" instead of using the method of "international cooperation" to satisfy the Korean people's aspirations?
    Since the establishment of the United Nations, the Soviet Union has consistently adhered to the principle of international cooperation. Stalin said in response to Little Roosevelt's question in 1946: "In the most vigorous and tense era, during the war, differences in political systems did not prevent our two countries from uniting to eliminate our enemies. Continuing this relationship in peacetime is even more possible." For five years, the Soviet Union's adherence to the principle of international cooperation within the United Nations has been based on this argument. The Soviet Union has repeatedly proposed resolutions on disarmament and banning atomic bombs in the United Nations. The Soviet Union has repeatedly proposed resolutions opposing American aggression against Korea and peacefully resolving the Korean issue. However, all proposals and suggestions have been delayed, obstructed, and ignored by American imperialism. It is enough to prove that American imperialism does not want international cooperation, and it is the Soviet Union that truly wants international cooperation.
    Truman also said that he wants "peace," that "we must resolve our disputes peacefully," and that the United States "is now willing to negotiate" and "believes that negotiation is a major part of this peaceful method." But what kind of peace is Truman's so-called "peace"? "North Korea immediately lays down its arms—and I will give you peace." Oh, it turns out that the "peace" that Truman is talking about is the peace of the Korean people surrendering to American aggression, the peace of the United States occupying Korea and turning it into an American colony. No wonder Truman himself does not have much confidence in obtaining this kind of peace, so immediately after talking about the words "peace" and "negotiation," he went on to say that "we have learned from hard experience that we cannot rely solely on negotiations to maintain peace," but must "be prepared to use force." Because the kind of "peace" that Truman wants has existed in human history, that is the peace of the Roman Empire ruling the world. But history has given world conquerors a good lesson, the Roman Empire did not have peace, it perished. Today, the progressive people of the world know how to recover true peace from the bloody hands of vicious executioners.
    Truman also talked nonsense about "democracy," boasted about America's "revolutionary ideas," and opened his eyes to spout nonsense about how "free and happy" American citizens are, in order to cover up the ugly social essence of American imperialism in front of the people of the world, and then deceive all nations and forcibly export the so-called "American way of life." Indeed, the United States fought for bourgeois freedom and equality in the early days of its founding—this is a historical fact. However, not only was the bourgeois freedom and equality at that time limited, but even this limited freedom and equality was long ago abandoned by the monopoly bourgeoisie in the imperialist stage. Now in the United States, there is only the freedom for capitalists to exploit workers, the freedom for reactionaries to carry out reactionary activities, the freedom for the Ku Klux Klan to massacre blacks, and the broad masses of the people have no freedom of belief, speech, or association. The enslaved and inhuman lives lived by 15 million blacks in the United States are one of the iron proofs that American society has no freedom or equality. The Taft-Hartley Act, the Mundt-Nixon Bill, the Loyalty Act, and the fascist reactionary organs such as the FBI and the House Un-American Activities Committee all show that the American bourgeoisie has long abandoned the so-called ideas of freedom and equality.
    Even in terms of material life, the American people are not happy. The United States has eight million fully or partially unemployed people living in poverty and hunger. More than 60 percent of American families earn wages that are 25 to 30 percent lower than the necessary minimum cost of living. More than ten million families do not have adequate housing. Twenty percent of the residential area in the United States is made up of slums, where one-third of the population, or 48 million American residents, live. Due to the housing panic, many homeless people spend their nights in all-night movie theaters, train stations, and even in cars. A quarter of school-age children in the United States do not have the opportunity to attend school, and adults who are able to finish college account for only 4.6 percent of all American adults. The economic panic in the United States is already very serious, so the likes of Truman are trying to use war to delay the total collapse of the American economic system.
    Truman also babbled that "we seek no territory or special privilege. Let everyone thoroughly understand this—we have no aggressive ambitions in Korea or anywhere else, in the Far East or elsewhere." Okay, then we ask Truman, not to mention what prompted the US government to send a large army, planes, and heavy artillery to attack the Korean people 5,000 miles away from the United States, exactly why does the United States want to occupy our Taiwan? Why does Taiwan's becoming Chinese territory "seriously threaten" America's "defense line in the Far East"? What does Taiwan have to do with your America that the United States raised the so-called "Formosa" issue in the United Nations? Truman said that he "sympathizes" with the Asian people and will "assist them in achieving and defending their independence." What a great joke! The road for Asian people to strive for independence is the road of anti-imperialism, the road of carrying out the struggle to get rid of imperialist control, could this actually get the "sympathy" and "assistance" of imperialist bandits? Indeed, Truman has been and still is sympathizing with and assisting a group of people, that group of people who betray the interests of their own nation and are willing to be imperialist puppets such as Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, Bao Dai, and Quirino. American imperialism has used a lot of money, materials, munitions, and even open armed forces to help these people suppress domestic national liberation movements.
    It is indeed the case that American imperialism is by no means a "stranger" to the people of the Far East. The people of the colonial and semi-colonial countries of the Far East have seen through the wolfish nature of American imperialism. Lies and cover-ups cannot deceive the people of the Far East. Truman wants to prove that the United States has no aggressive ambitions, there is only one way, take out the facts: immediately stop the offensive against the Korean people, and withdraw the American armed intervention forces from Korea, Taiwan, and all other regions of the Far East.
    The Asian people do cherish their freedom and independence. We know how to defend our freedom and independence at all costs when they are insulted and violated. The Chinese people have learned from their own experience that American imperialism is not terrible at all, its aggression can be defeated, and it will definitely be defeated!
    People of all of Asia and the world unite, and resolutely oppose the American imperialist policy of aggression!

　　美国是帝国主义侵略和法西斯反动的罪魁
    ——驳杜鲁门旧金山、纽约演讲
    杜  礼
    继杜鲁门与麦克阿瑟扩大太平洋侵略战争的阴谋会议后，杜鲁门于十月十八、十月二十四日先后在旧金山、纽约发表演说。这两篇演说用了许多欺人的自相矛盾的词藻，但其主旨却有一个，即加紧武装美国，加强各资本主义仆从国家的备战计划，以进一步扩大侵略战争，图用战争来对付苏联与各人民民主国家。
    美帝国主义为实现其独霸世界的迷梦，曾经采用了种种威吓欺骗的方法来对待世界各国。在美帝国主义的吞并政策下，许多资本主义的或殖民地的国家都沦为美国的附庸国了，失去了领土主权与国家内政的独立自主权。但以苏联为首的社会主义及人民民主国家则坚持着自己本国领土主权的独立完整，并紧握反对侵略的保卫世界持久而民主的和平的旗帜。美帝国主义看到对这些国家骗既骗不成，吓也吓不倒，压又压不住，就只好拿出武力的手段。六月二十五日爆发的朝鲜战争，就是美帝国主义阴谋武装进攻人民民主国家的开端。现在杜鲁门又在叫嚣所谓“必须准备使用武力”，“必须用实力来反对实力”了，其含义即美帝国主义已决心继续以武力来贯彻其奴役全世界的迷梦。
    杜鲁门在十月十八日旧金山演讲中说：“我们必须继续增加我们的武装部队——海陆空军——的实力。我们必须把较多的我们的资源用于军事用途，把较少的资源用于民生消费。”“我们正在极端认真地建立我们的防务，毫不会因在朝鲜取得的胜利而松懈。”他又在十月二十四日的纽约广播中告英法等仆从国家说：“必须在被号召时供给军事力量”，以执行美国的侵略计划。
    听吧，帝国主义强盗是如何明目张胆地在向全世界宣告他的战争决心！他是如何在向美国的以及世界各国劳动人民的和平生活开战，要大家紧衣缩食以服从独占资本家的军火利润。他又是何等狂妄，竟然宣称毫不因在朝鲜取得“胜利”而松懈“防务”！这即是说，美帝国主义的侵略欲望决不止于朝鲜，杜鲁门一定要进一步把侵略的战火烧向中国边境！
    我们早就看清楚美帝国主义决不会停止于侵略一个朝鲜。侵略朝鲜只是它侵略亚洲、并进而征服全世界的计划的一部分。中国人民脑子里有个很深刻的记忆，当年日本帝国主义侵略中国，就是从侵略朝鲜、侵略台湾开始，然后进到侵略中国东北和内陆的。今天美帝国主义正在抄袭日本的老文章，从朝鲜而台湾而趋东北边境，难道中国人民能对这一事实坐视无睹吗？
    奇怪的是杜鲁门在这两次鼓动战争的演说中，除了宣告要决心扩大侵略战争外，却无味地咀嚼了一大套所谓“国际合作”、“和平”、“民主”以及“在远东或别处都没有侵略的野心”、“同情”亚洲人民“并且将协助他们取得和保卫他们的独立”等等谰言。看来，即便是战争贩子，亦多少知道一点光谈“使用武力”不谈“国际合作”、或光谈战争不谈“和平”还是交代不过去的。这说明全世界的、全亚洲的与全美国的人民大众不愿意战争，不支持美帝国主义的侵略战争。
    现在我们就来看看杜鲁门所谈的“国际合作”究竟是怎么回事。
    “今天，全世界的人们都在追求一个更美好的生活。他们想从过去的羁绊与邪恶中解脱出来，他们想创造他们自己的命运。这些愿望是可以——不必经过冲突和流血——通过联合国以国际合作的方法来满足的。”一点也不错，今天朝鲜人民都在追求一个自由独立的生活，他们要摆脱美帝傀儡李承晚匪帮的邪恶统治，要掌握自己是国家主人翁的命运。但是谁假借了联合国名义给朝鲜人民的神圣愿望以血腥的打击呢？朝鲜内战刚刚爆发，又是那一个国家立即蛮横而非法地“通过联合国”以“流血”的方法来干涉朝鲜内政，而不是“国际合作”的方法使朝鲜人民满足自己的愿望呢？
    从联合国组织成立以来，苏联始终不渝地坚持国际合作的原则。斯大林在一九四六年回答小罗斯福问题说：“在最奋发紧张的时代，战争期间，政体方面的差异，并不曾阻挠我们两国联合在一块，以消灭我们的敌人。在和平时代继续这种关系，就更加是可能的了。”五年以来，苏联在联合国组织内之坚持国际合作的原则，就是从这一论据出发的。苏联曾一再在联合国提出裁减军备与禁用原子弹的建议案。苏联曾一再提出反对美国侵略朝鲜，和平解决朝鲜问题的提案。但是一切提案和建议都遭到美帝国主义的拖延阻挠与不理。足证美帝国主义并不要国际合作，真正要国际合作的是苏联。
    杜鲁门也说要“和平”，说“必须和平地解决我们的争端”，又说什么美国“现在愿意进行谈判”，“认为谈判是这个和平方法的一个主要部分”。但杜鲁门所谓的“和平”究竟是那一种和平呢？“北朝鲜立即放下武器——我就给你和平”。哦，原来杜鲁门所讲的“和平”是朝鲜人民降服于美国侵略的和平，是由美国占领朝鲜，把朝鲜沦为美帝殖民地的和平。无怪乎杜鲁门自己对获取这种和平的信心也不大，所以在刚谈完了“和平”“谈判”的字眼，接着就说“我们已从辛苦的经验中知道，我们不能单依靠谈判来保持和平”，而必须“准备使用武力”了。因为杜鲁门所要的这种“和平”在人类历史上曾经有过，那就是罗马帝国统治世界的和平。但历史已给世界征服者很好的教训，罗马帝国并没有和平，它灭亡了。今天，全世界的进步人类懂得如何从凶恶的刽子手的血手中，挽回真正的和平。
    杜鲁门又说什么“民主”，吹嘘美国的“革命思想”，张着眼睛瞎说美国公民如何“自由和幸福”，以图在全世界人民面前掩盖美帝国主义的丑恶的社会本质，并进而欺骗各民族，强制输出所谓“美国的生活方式”。诚然，美国在建国初期，曾经为着资产阶级的自由、平等而奋斗——这是一个历史事实。可是，不仅当时的资产阶级自由、平等是有限制的，而且连这种有限制的自由平等，到了帝国主义阶段，独占资产阶级也早已把它抛弃了。现在在美国，只有资本家剥削工人的自由，反动派进行反动活动的自由，三Ｋ党残杀黑人的自由，广大的人民大众是没有信仰、言论、结社自由的。美国国内一千五百万黑人所过的被奴役的非人的生活，是美国社会没有自由平等的铁证之一。塔夫脱反劳工法案、蒙特法案、忠诚法以及联邦调查局、非美活动委员会等等法西斯反动机关，都说明美国资产阶级早已抛弃了所谓自由平等的思想。
    即使从物质生活讲，美国人民大众也不幸福。美国有八百万全失业或半失业人口生活在贫困与饥饿之中。有百分之六十以上的美国家庭所赚得的工资，比较必需的最低限度的生活费低了百分之二十五至三十。有一千万人口以上的家庭没有适当的房子住。全美国有百分之二十的居住面积是由贫民窟构成的，其中住着占人口三分之一的，也即四千八百万的美国居民。由于房子恐慌，许多没房住的人都到通宵放映的电影院、火车站甚至在汽车里度夜。美国的学龄儿童有四分之一没有入学机会，能够读完大学的成年，只占美国全部成年的百分之四·六。美国国内的经济恐慌已经很严重了，因此杜鲁门之流图用战争来延迟美国经济制度的总崩溃。
    杜鲁门又胡说什么“我们不寻求领土或特权。让一切人透彻了解这一点——我们在朝鲜或任何其他地方，在远东或别处都没有侵略野心。”好，那末我们就问杜鲁门，且不说是什么东西促使美国政府派遣大军、飞机、重炮去攻打远离美国五千英里的朝鲜人民吧，究竟是为什么美国要占领我们的台湾？为什么台湾之成为中国领土就“严重威胁”了美国“在远东的防线”？台湾与你美国究竟有什么关系，要美国在联合国提出所谓“福摩萨”问题？杜鲁门说他“同情”亚洲人民，并将“协助他们取得和保卫他们的独立”。真是天大的笑话！亚洲人民争取独立的道路就是反帝国主义的道路，就是进行摆脱帝国主义控制的斗争的道路，难道这竟能得到帝国主义强盗的“同情”、“协助”吗？不错，杜鲁门曾经而且现在一直是在同情和协助一批人，那一批人就是出卖本民族利益的、甘当帝国主义傀儡的蒋介石、李承晚、保大、季里诺之流。美帝国主义用了不少金钱、物资、军火甚至公开的武装部队来帮助这批人镇压国内的民族解放运动。
    的确是这样，美帝国主义对于远东人民来说一点不是“陌生人”。远东殖民地的和半殖民地的国家的人民都看透了美帝国主义的豺狼的本质。谎话和掩词是欺骗不了远东人民的。杜鲁门想证明美国没有侵略野心只有一个办法，拿出事实来：立即停止对朝鲜人民的进攻，把美国武装干涉部队从朝鲜、台湾和远东其他一切地区撤出去。
    亚洲人民的确珍贵自己的自由和独立。我们懂得如何在自己的自由和独立遭受侮辱和侵犯时，不惜一切代价地保卫它。中国人民从自己的经验里知道了美帝国主义一点亦不可怕，它的侵略是可以被击退的，亦一定会被击退！
    全亚洲和全世界的人民团结起来，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策！
