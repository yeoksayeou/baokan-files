　　My First Experience in a Fortified Attack
    Ruan Changgeng
    In mid-September 1935, only five days after the Red Twenty-Fifth Army arrived in northern Shaanxi, the westward advance troops of the Chiang bandits, led by Wang Yize, began their third encirclement and suppression campaign against the Shaanxi-Gansu Soviet area. Wang, the bandit leader, ordered his division commander, Gao "Big Belly," to lead the main force vanguard of the 107th Division to occupy Daozuopu Town in Luochuan, constructing fortresses and stockades, setting up strongholds, and attempting to advance further after the rear guard troops arrived. This was an old tactic that the bandits had used during the five encirclement and suppression campaigns in the Jiangxi Soviet area. They believed that the Red Army could not fight fortified battles and could only fight in mobile warfare in the field. Therefore, they adopted this tactic of "steady advance, step-by-step consolidation."
    In order to defend the Shaanxi-Gansu Soviet area at that time, and to realize the anti-Japanese proposition, the Red Army resolutely smashed the enemy's offensive and mobilized all forces to launch a counter-encirclement and suppression struggle. Thus, the Red Twenty-Fifth Army received the task of annihilating the enemy in Daozuopu Town. At that time, I was a machine gun squad leader in the Third Company, First Battalion, 203rd Regiment of the Twenty-Fifth Army. My regiment was responsible for attacking the three large stockades north of Daozuopu, and a part of the 205th Regiment was responsible for attacking several strongholds south of the town. Our main force was preparing for street fighting.
    We took advantage of the enemy's weakness of not having a firm foothold, and adopted a long-distance raid: traveling eighty li of mountain roads in one night, and launching the battle before dawn.
    Before dusk, the troops, with a tense and excited mood, marched toward their respective targets. Although the road was very difficult and the sky was dark, we still maintained a speed of seven or eight li per hour, climbed over three or four large mountains, crossed several small rivers, and marched forward.
    The autumn night wind in the north blew the leaves wildly. The sorghum flattened by the wind lay unevenly on the road, and many soldiers were tripped over it, but they quickly got up, lifted their feet higher, and continued to stride forward. The company commander ran into a small ditch, looked at his watch under the light of a flashlight, and immediately ran to the front, saying to the vanguard squad, "It's already two o'clock, and there are still more than twenty li to the enemy, move faster!" When the fifth squad leader heard the company commander's order, he told the guide, "You go faster!" The old man did not understand him, just staring at him with wide eyes. The squad leader pushed him a few steps with his hand, and he realized that he was being told to go faster.
    As dawn was approaching, the vanguard company responsible for the attack had approached the enemy. Nervous assault soldiers were lying down and crawling forward in the sorghum fields. It was even quieter around. The password came from the front: "Quiet, don't cough, the enemy's stockade is ahead." Soon, the assault team was all close to the enemy. The company commander was busy looking at the terrain, deploying firepower, indicating the assault route, and teaching the assault team how to climb the stockade. The three machine guns in my squad formed a firepower group, directly covering the assault. The east began to dawn, everything was ready, and everyone was looking forward to the attack signal from the battalion headquarters.
    At 5:30, the signal flare emitted a red light in the sky above the enemy's position, and the bugles kept blowing, and the soldiers immediately rushed towards the enemy like a gust of wind. Machine guns and hand grenades rang out in unison, and the enemy, who was hastily responding, was thrown into chaos. Many hand grenades were thrown down from the stockade wall without even opening the lids! The assault team had run out of hand grenades, so the soldiers picked up the enemy's bombs and returned the fire. The first platoon leader caught a bomb thrown by the enemy and threw it back into the enemy's crowd before it exploded. After only ten minutes of fighting, the assault team began to climb the city. Some used ladders, and some used bayonets to stab into the earthen wall as ladders, and climbed up the high wall of one zhang and five or six chi from several places at the same time. The signal for scaling the city had been sent, and it only took five minutes to occupy the first stockade, and the entire defending company was captured. Among the prisoners, except for the sentries, the squad leader in charge, and four people playing cards wearing military uniforms, the other 110-odd people, including the company commander and below, were only wearing a shirt, or a pair of underpants, with bare heads and bare feet. The defenders of the other two stockades and several blockhouses were also annihilated in the same way. The outer encirclement battle ended completely at nine o'clock in the morning. The First Battalion alone captured more than 500 enemies.
    At this time, Gao "Big Belly" was still carrying out a desperate struggle in Daozuopu Town with a guard battalion. In the afternoon, Army Commander Xu Haidong personally handed over the task of street fighting to the First Battalion, and took the photo of the bandit army division commander from the captured prisoners and handed it to us, asking us to capture him alive.
    The fierce street fighting unfolded. We gradually approached the earthen kilns that the enemy was stubbornly holding on to from all directions. The enemy guard battalion was finally captured by our broadswords and grenade attacks. We found the enemy division commander, Gao "Big Belly," wearing a soldier's uniform, from the group of prisoners. The great annihilation battle ended victoriously at dusk, and the enemy troops who came to reinforce were also repelled by our friendly forces.

　　我参加的第一个攻坚战
    阮长庚
    一九三五年九月中旬，红二十五军到达陕北刚刚五天，以王亦泽为首的蒋匪西进部队就开始了对陕北苏区的第三次围剿。王匪命令他的师长高大肚子率领一○七师主力先锋，由洛川进占了道左铺镇，构筑堡垒，修寨子，安下据点，企图待后卫部队赶到再继续前进。这是匪徒们在江西苏区五次围剿时曾经使用过的老办法。他们认为红军不能打攻坚战，只会在野外运动中作战，因此就采取这种“稳扎稳打，步步为营”的战术。
    红军为了保卫当时的陕北苏区，实现抗日主张，坚决粉碎敌人的进攻，就动员一切力量展开反围剿斗争。于是红军二十五军受领了歼灭道左铺镇的敌人的任务。那时，我在二十五军二○三团一营三连当机枪班长。我团担任攻击道左铺以北的三个大寨子，二○五团一部担任攻击该镇河南的几个据点。我们的主力则准备着巷战。
    我们利用敌人立脚未稳的弱点，采取远距离奔袭：一夜里走八十里的山路，拂晓前就要展开战斗。
    黄昏前，部队怀着紧张兴奋的心情，照着自己的目标分路行进了。虽然道路非常难走，天色又黑，但我们仍然保持了一小时七、八里的速度，爬过三、四个大山，涉过了数条小河，向前行进。
    北国秋天的夜风把树叶吹得乱飞。被风刮倒的谷子参差不齐地躺在路上，很多战士被它绊倒，但立刻很快地爬起来，把脚抬得更高一些，继续大步前进。连长跑到一个小沟里，在手电筒的亮光下看了看表，他马上跑到前边，对尖兵班说：“已经两点了，距敌人还有二十多里，走快些！”五班长听到连长的命令后，就告诉向导说：“你走快些！”老乡不懂他的话，只是张大着眼睛看他。班长就用手推他跑了几步，他才知道是叫他走快些。
    天快拂晓了，担任攻击的前卫连，已经接近了敌人。精神紧张的突击队员们，一个个躺倒了在谷子地里爬着前进。周围更肃静了。前面传来了口令：“肃静，不要咳嗽，前边就是敌人的寨子。”不一会，突击队全部接近了敌人。连长忙着看地形，布置火力，指示冲锋道路，教突击队爬寨的方法。我班三挺机枪组织了一个火力群，直接掩护突击。东方开始发亮了，一切都准备好了，大家只盼望着营部发出攻击的讯号。
    五点三十分，信号弹在敌人阵地的上空发出红色的火光，号声不停地叫起来，战士们立刻风一样地向敌人冲过去。机枪、手榴弹响成一片，慌忙应战的敌人乱成一团。很多手榴弹连盖也未揭开就从寨墙上扔下来了！突击队的手榴弹已经打尽，战士们就拾起敌人的炸弹还击敌人。一排长接住敌人投来的炸弹，未等它爆炸又扔到敌军的人群里去了。仅仅经过十分钟的战斗，突击队就开始爬城了。有的用梯子，有的用刺刀扎到土墙里当梯子，从几个地方同时爬上了一丈五、六尺的高墙。登城讯号已经发出，只用五分钟的时间就占领了第一个寨子，守敌一个连全部就擒。俘虏们除了哨兵、带班的班长和四个打牌的穿着军服以外，其他连长以下一百一十余人，却只穿一套衬衣，或一条裤叉，光着脑袋打着赤脚。其他两个寨子和几个炮楼的守敌也同样被歼灭。外围战斗便在上午九点钟全部结束了。仅一营就俘掳敌人五百余。
    这时，高大肚子带着一个卫队营在道左铺镇还进行着垂死的挣扎。下午，徐海东军长亲自把巷战的任务交给了一营，并把匪军师长的像片从俘虏身上搜出来交给我们，要我们去把他活捉。
    激烈的巷战展开了。我们一步步从四周逼近敌人固守着的土窑。敌人卫队营终于在我们的大刀和手榴弹进攻下被擒了。我们从俘虏群中找出了那个穿着士兵衣服的敌人师长——高大肚子。伟大的歼灭战就这样在黄昏时胜利结束了，来援的敌军也被我们的友军击退。
