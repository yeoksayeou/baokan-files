Xinhua News Agency, October 1st—Pauker, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Romanian People's Republic, sent a telegram to Zhou Enlai, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of China, to offer congratulations. The original telegram is as follows:
    To Mr. Zhou Enlai，Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China：
    On the occasion of the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I would like to extend my warm congratulations to you personally and to your government. The Romanian people have been following with great concern the Chinese people's struggle for liberation from the oppression of imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique; they are also overjoyed by the victories achieved by the Chinese people in building a new China and defending peace and opposing imperialist aggressors. I wish you complete success in your work to strive for the prosperity of the free, independent, and democratic People's Republic of China—an active element of the peace camp headed by our common friend, the Soviet Union.
    Pauker, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Romanian People's Republic
