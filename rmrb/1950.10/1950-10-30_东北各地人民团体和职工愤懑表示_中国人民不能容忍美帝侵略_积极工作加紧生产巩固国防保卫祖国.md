[Report from this newspaper] The crimes of American imperialism in expanding the war of aggression against Korea and continuously sending aircraft to invade our country's airspace have aroused immense anger among the people of Northeast China.

The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, Democratic Women's Federation, Student Federation, Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Northeast Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, and Northeast Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and other people's organizations, issued a joint statement on the 27th, warning the American aggressors that the invading troops in Korea must withdraw immediately. The people of Northeast China and the entire country will never tolerate the aggressors burning the flames of war onto our territory, and will never tolerate the security of our motherland being threatened. The statement called on all the people of Northeast China to redouble their efforts to work hard to defend the motherland.

People's organizations such as the trade unions, Youth League, and Democratic Women's Federation in the provinces and cities of Jilin, Rehe, Liaoxi, Heilongjiang, and Qiqihar have also successively lodged serious protests, expressing absolute intolerance for the barbarous acts of American imperialism in expanding the war of aggression against Korea. Zhu Guohua, a Liaoxi industrial labor model who attended the National Labor Model Representative Conference, said indignantly: "The United States is frantically expanding its war of aggression,妄想trying to make us their slaves. But we have the leadership of Chairman Mao and a powerful Chinese People's Liberation Army. We have sufficient strength to eliminate the aggressors." Meo Yuzhang, an agricultural labor model from the suburbs of Jinzhou City, said: "We are ready to eliminate the aggressors who provoke us at any time." The protest letter from various people's organizations in Rehe Province stated: The Security Council should immediately take effective measures to stop the mad aggression of American imperialism, and immediately withdraw its troops from Korea to extinguish the flames of war expansion.

The entire workers of the Fuxin City Mining Area Committee, the city's Youth League members, members of the Women's Federation, and members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association jointly issued a written opinion, calling on the people of the city and mines to unite to oppose the American imperialists' expansion of the war of aggression. The Qiqihar City Federation of Trade Unions called on the city's workers to further carry out the production competition movement with selfless spirit, and strive to complete the 1950 production plan ahead of schedule, so as to enhance national defense strength, defend the motherland, and smash the American imperialist aggression dreams.

All the workers of the clothing factory of the Clothing Bureau of the Northeast Ministry of Finance, while making cotton-padded coats, saw in the newspaper that the American imperialists were constantly carrying out aggression and provocations against us, which aroused great anger, and unanimously stated: Complete the task of cotton-padded coats five days ahead of schedule to support the People's Liberation Army. The factory has spontaneously launched a production competition. At present, the vast majority (95%) of the factory's workers are on the honor roll, and the factory's production efficiency has increased by 30% compared with the beginning of October. The Harbin Textile Trade Union wrote in a protest letter issued on October 17: We, the 3,200 employees of the Harbin textile industry, resolutely protest the frantic aggressive acts of American imperialism, and resolutely support the proposal of the Soviet Union and other five countries for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue and Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. Under the wise leadership of our great Chairman Mao, we are not afraid of any provocations from aggressors. We will unite like steel and ensure the early completion of military production tasks, support the People's Liberation Army, and defend the motherland's borders. All 400 employees of the Changchun Power Supply Bureau held a discussion to protest the crime of American aircraft bombing our Northeast, and expressed their determination to do a good job in safe power supply. At the discussion, Wang Qing, a sand-mold worker at the power plant, said: "If some people didn't recognize the hideous face of the American imperialists in the past, then the facts now tell us: American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people and the mortal enemy of the people of the world!" Line worker Jie Yongcun said: "I am confident in doing a good job in safe power supply in the rear, so as to answer American imperialism." Worker Yin Guijiu said: "The people of Northeast China and the people of the whole country are entering a period of peaceful construction. The American imperialists are jealous and come to make trouble. We have always loved peace, but we must resist the aggressors." When talking about how to protest the American imperialist aggression, everyone unanimously stated: Do a good job in power supply, step up the preparation of strength, so as to combat any aggressive behavior of American imperialism. The entire staff of the Changchun Cigarette Factory recently issued a protest letter against the American imperialist aggression, stating: We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's protest to the United States and the telegram to the United Nations, and the recent Soviet peace plan proposed in the United Nations General Assembly. We are even more determined to express: We must contribute our best efforts to production, consolidate national defense, and give a strong blow to the aggressors! In addition, all the workers of the Fushun Open-pit Mine are also stepping up anti-special and air defense, protecting production, and striving to complete the production tasks for the fourth quarter of this year!
