Fight to the End to Build a Strong New China!
—Model Representatives Continue to Express Their Thoughts After Meeting Chairman Mao

　　The heroic and model representatives attending the National Congress of Combat Heroes and Labor Models continue to express their thoughts after meeting Chairman Mao.

　　In the past, during battles and work, in the most difficult and arduous times, the thought of Chairman Mao gave them courage and confidence. Many people thought of Chairman Mao as they gave their last drop of blood and their last bit of energy for the Party and the people. Thinking of him, they could close their eyes in peace and die heroically, envisioning the victory of the revolutionary cause they had not completed. And now, this great man was sitting calmly in front of them—what happiness, what glory this was!

　　Liu Meicun, a combat hero of the Fourth Field Army, fought even more bravely after meeting Chairman Mao for the first time at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference last year. When he led the Seventh Company in a rapid surprise attack on Bobai in the Guangxi-Guangdong border region in early December last winter, he advanced the fastest and was the first to penetrate the enemy's Third Army headquarters, cooperating with fraternal units to capture Zhang Gan, the deputy commander of the enemy's "Central China Military and Political Office" and commander of the Third Army. During the attack on Hainan Island this spring, one of the points in the challenge letter issued by Liu Meicun and the comrades of his entire battalion was: "Earn merit to see Chairman Mao!" He successfully completed the task of annihilating the enemy in the Hainan Island campaign, made great contributions, and so today he met Chairman Mao again. After meeting Chairman Mao this time, he said: "Chairman Mao said last year that the victory of the Chinese revolution was only the first step of the Long March. I am determined to follow Chairman Mao in taking the second step…, to always be a revolutionary soldier, to defend the motherland and world peace! Maintain glory, promote glory! Strive for the third, fourth… meeting with Chairman Mao with new honors."

　　After Chairman Mao delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the CPC Central Committee to the representatives, Tian Guiying, a railway labor model—China's first female train driver—applauded and said to the comrades next to her: "We must drive the 'March 8th' locomotive even more steadily and skillfully!" New record creator Zhao Guoyou and industrial labor model and old hero Liu Yingyuan all talked to their nearby comrades, revealing a firm spirit to better engage in production in response to Chairman Mao's call.

　　Zhao Naibin, a labor model from Tangshan Steel Plant, said after meeting Chairman Mao: I studied mining, but under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, what I learned was not used. I was unemployed after graduation and forced to teach. Only after liberation was I introduced to work at the Tangshan Steel Plant by comrades, and what I learned was finally put to use. I used to be like ore abandoned in a deep pit, ignored. Chairman Mao is like a miner; he extracted me from the deep pit. Chairman Mao is truly the great benefactor of the Chinese people. Seeing that Chairman Mao is very healthy has directly increased my confidence in working to build a new China. After returning to the factory, I will definitely bring the news of Chairman Mao's health and his instructions to the worker brothers. In the future, our technicians and workers must unite more closely to build our new country.

　　After the children of the Central Military Commission Nursery presented flowers and flags, a seven- or eight-year-old girl walked to the loudspeaker and said in a clear voice: "Uncles and aunts, we want to learn from you. When we grow up, we will also be heroes and models, and be good students of Chairman Mao."

　　"Be good students of Chairman Mao"—this sentence expresses the unanimous wish of the heroes and models. Yu Minsun, a female militia hero from the East China Military Region, said after the meeting: "Looking at those children, thinking about having just met Chairman Mao and having heard Chairman Mao's words, I am very excited. I have no other thoughts, I just want to work hard to always be a good student of Chairman Mao."

　　Chairman Mao's loud voice and brilliant call condensed the hearts of the representatives at the meeting and the people of all China on a common will. This will is: "Fight to the end to build a strong national defense force and a strong economic force for the new China!"

　　为建立强大的新中国战斗到底！
    ——英模代表继续发表见了毛主席后的感想
    出席全国战斗英雄和劳动模范代表会议的英雄模范代表们，继续发表他们见到了毛主席之后的感想。
    过去，他们在作战中，在工作中，在最困难最艰苦的时候，一想到毛主席，就有了勇气，有了信心。许多人在为党、为人民付出自己的最后一滴血，最后的生命力时，想念着毛主席。想到了他，就对着自己没有完成的革命事业的胜利远景而安然瞑目，而慷慨就义。眼前，这伟大的人，就雍容地坐在自己的前面，这是多大的幸福，多大的光荣啊！
    四野战斗英雄刘梅村在去年人民政协会议中，第一次见了毛主席后，战斗得更英勇了。当去冬十二月初他在粤桂边境奔袭博白那天，他带领着七连急行猛追、前进得最快，首先插入城内的敌第三兵团部，配合兄弟部队，活捉了敌“华中军政公署”副长官兼第三兵团司令张淦。今春进攻海南岛时，刘梅村和他率领的全营同志们的挑战书中，有一条就是：“立功争取见毛主席！”海南岛战役他胜利地完成了歼灭敌人的任务，立下了大功，于是今天他又见到了毛主席。在这次见过毛主席后，他说：“毛主席去年说中国革命的胜利才走完了万里长征的第一步，我决心跟着毛主席走第二步………，永远作个革命的战士，保卫祖国、保卫世界和平！保持光荣，发扬光荣！以新的荣誉争取第三次、第四次，……会见毛主席。”
    毛主席代表中共中央向代表们致祝词后，铁路劳模——中国第一名女火车司机田桂英，一面鼓掌一面和旁边的同志说：“咱一定把‘三八’号机车开得更稳更拿手！”新纪录创始者赵国有、工业劳模老英雄刘英源都互相同邻近的同志谈着，露出响应毛主席号召更好地搞生产的坚决神气。
    唐山炼钢厂劳模赵乃斌见过毛主席后说：我是学矿业的，但在国民党反动派统治时，我所学非所用，毕业后失业，被迫去教书，解放后我才被同志介绍到唐山炼钢厂工作，所学的东西才用上了。早先我好比是矿石一样被遗弃在深坑中无人理睬，毛主席好比是采矿工人，他把我从万丈深坑中开采出来了。毛主席真是我们中国人民的大恩人。我看见毛主席很健康，也就直接增加了我为建设新中国工作的信心。回厂后，我定要把毛主席健康的消息和他给我的指示带给工人弟兄，今后我们技术人员与工人更要亲密地团结起来，建设我们的新国家。
    中央军委保育院的小朋友们在献花献旗以后，有一个七、八岁的小女孩走到扩音机前，用清脆的声音说：“叔叔、阿姨们：我们要向你们学习，长大了也做英雄、做模范，做毛主席的好学生。”
    “做毛主席的好学生”，这句话，道出了英雄模范一致的心愿。华东军区民兵女英雄玉敏孙在会后说：“我看着那些小孩子，想着刚才见过毛主席和听过毛主席的话，我心里非常激动，我没有别的思想，只想努力永远做毛主席的好学生。”
    毛主席宏亮的声音、英明的号召，把会场代表们、把全中国的人民的心凝结在一个共同的意志之上。这个意志就是：“为建立新中国强大的国防军及强大的经济力量而战斗到底！”
