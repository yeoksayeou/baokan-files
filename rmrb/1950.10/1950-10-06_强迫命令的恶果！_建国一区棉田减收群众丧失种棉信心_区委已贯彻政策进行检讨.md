　　The Bitter Fruit of Coercive Orders!
　　Reduced Cotton Production and Loss of Confidence in Cotton Planting in the First District of Jianguo
　　The District Committee Has Conducted a Review in Accordance with Policy.
　　[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the beginning of summer, the acreage of cotton fields in the First District of Jianguo County, Hebei Province, has sharply decreased, the harvest of some cotton fields has been very poor, and the masses have lost confidence in cotton planting. On September 1, the District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in the district convened an enlarged meeting of village cadre representatives from the entire district to review the cotton planting work this spring and to arrange the work for the Three Autumns [referring to the autumn harvest and planting season]. The western part of the district has some cotton planting habits, while the central and eastern parts are low-lying, and the masses have no cotton planting habits and do not understand cotton planting techniques. This spring, the entire district planted 14,738 mu of cotton (originally reported as more than 17,000 mu). Since the beginning of summer, there have been continuous rains, and some villages' cotton fields have been flooded, greatly reducing the acreage. After receiving a notice and instructions from the Cang County Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the entire district conducted a comprehensive inspection. The inspection revealed many serious problems: First, the cotton field acreage in the entire district has sharply decreased to 10,692 mu. The reasons for the decrease in cotton fields, in addition to some villages underreporting and reducing more than 200 mu, were mainly due to the coercive methods adopted by cadres when arranging cotton planting. As a result, the masses did not understand the cotton planting policy and had ideological concerns. In order to cope with higher authorities, they planted a lot of cotton in low-lying areas, alkaline land, and woodland. 105 mu were killed by alkaline soil before the rain, and 3,657 mu of cotton in low-lying areas were drowned after heavy rain. The cotton planted in woodlands was regarded by the masses as "better to harvest some, but if not, it doesn't matter," so they did not pay attention to management or repair. Therefore, even the cotton that was not damaged by flooding was mostly reduced in yield. Of the existing cotton fields, more than 7,700 mu have a relatively good harvest, while the rest yield less than ten jin of seed cotton per mu. Second, village cadres and the masses lacked cotton planting techniques, and leading cadres at higher levels did not promptly teach the masses repair methods. Some people planted one or two mu and ended up abandoning it, thus losing confidence. Some even said: "If the higher authorities don't execute me next year, I will never plant cotton again." Third, in order to complete the task when planting cotton, the figures were underreported; now, under the pretext of being affected by disaster, they are overreported to avoid public purchase or requisition because the market price is higher than the purchase price. Based on this situation, at the meeting, the secretary of the District Committee first made a review report on the cotton planting work this spring. The report focused on reviewing the district leaders' focus on mere numbers and increasing tasks, requiring the task to be completed within five to seven days, while neglecting the implementation of policy publicity, dispelling the masses' ideological concerns, and adopting coercive methods. When Zhang Mingzhang and other three members of the District Committee launched cotton planting in Nanwangda Village, the three took turns holding mass meetings of the entire village, forcing the masses to self-report the acreage of cotton planting with the method of "the meeting will not be dismissed until the acreage of cotton planting is reported." The meeting lasted from evening until dawn, and the masses reluctantly reported 850 mu, but the actual planting was only 430 mu. The District Committee also called on everyone to offer opinions in the spirit of rectification. During group discussions, everyone raised opinions to the leaders, exposing their ideological concerns about cotton planting. Some were afraid of being flooded or killed by alkaline soil again, some were worried about not having the technology and being unable to plant well, and some still believed that planting cotton only yielded one season and was not as cost-effective as planting other crops.
　　At this time, the meeting used practical accounting examples to clear up the masses' thinking. Lu Xiuying, the deputy secretary of the Chinese Communist Party branch in Zhongwangda Village, brought two cotton plants from her field for everyone to see, each with forty or fifty cotton bolls. She told everyone: First, cotton must be planted in good land. Second, cotton is a diligent activity, and it must be diligently managed. Third, you must understand the technology, and if you don't understand, learn from others. She calculated: 3.5 mu of cotton could yield more than 200 jin of seed cotton per mu, equivalent to 70 jin of lint cotton, which could be exchanged for more than 700 jin of millet. Others with technology and those who had achieved success in cotton planting also introduced their experiences to everyone one after another. These practical examples increased everyone's confidence in cotton planting and corrected the idea of planting cotton in bad land. The cadres also realized that falsely reporting figures was wrong, and they said, "If we don't tell the truth to the higher authorities, we are irresponsible to the masses." Everyone studied the issue of reserving land for cotton planting in groups and decided to go back to the village and explain and promote it to the masses.

　　Editor's Note: The spirit of the Jianguo First District Committee of conducting self-criticism in the spirit of rectification and paying attention to absorbing the opinions of cadres and the masses below is correct. However, the District Committee should implement policies and arrange work through the party member cadres of each village, and should not directly convene meetings of village cadre representatives. This kind of work style that does not separate party and government and takes on everything at once, on the one hand, affects the enthusiasm of government cadres, and on the other hand, affects the work of the District Committee itself. Therefore, attention should be paid to correcting it during the rectification period.

　　强迫命令的恶果！
    建国一区棉田减收群众丧失种棉信心
    区委已贯彻政策进行检讨
    【本报讯】河北建国县一区入夏以来，棉田亩数锐减，部分棉田收成很坏，群众丧失种棉信心。该区中共区委于九月一日召开全区村干部代表扩大会议，检查今春种棉工作并布置三秋工作。一个西部地区稍有种棉习惯，中部和东部地区地势低洼，群众无种棉习惯不懂种棉技术。今春全区种棉一万四千七百三十八亩（原报一万七千多亩）。入夏以来，雨水连绵，有些村庄棉田被淹，亩数大减。中共沧县地委通报指示后，全区曾进行一次普遍检查。检查中发现许多严重问题：首先是全区棉田已锐减至一万零六百九十二亩。棉田减少原因，除有些村庄以少报多减去二百余亩外，主要是干部布置种棉时采取强迫命令方式，因而群众对种棉政策不了解，思想上有顾虑，为了应付上级，就把不少棉花种在洼地、碱地和树林地里，雨前即被碱死一百零五亩，大雨后洼地棉花淹死三千六百五十七亩。种在树林地的棉花，群众存有“收点更好、不收就算”的思想，不注意也不会修理，因之，未淹坏的棉花也多减产。现有棉田中除七千七百余亩收成较好外，其余每亩还收不到十斤皮棉。其次，村干部和群众缺乏种棉技术，上级领导干部又没有及时教给群众修理办法，有的人种上一两亩结果都荒了，因而失掉信心。有人甚至说：“明年上级如果不枪毙我，我就再不种棉花了。”第三是种棉时为了交待任务，以少报多，现在借口被灾，又以多报少，避免公家收购或征收，因为市场价格比收购价格高。根据这种情况，会议上，区委书记首先就今春种棉工作作了检讨报告。报告中着重检讨了区领导上单纯的要数字、增加任务，限五天到七天突击完成任务，而忽略了贯彻政策宣传，解除群众思想顾虑，而采取了强迫命令的办法。区委张明章等三人在南王大村发动种棉时，三人轮班开全村群众大会，以“不报种棉亩数不散会”的办法，逼迫群众自报种棉亩数。会议从晚上开到天亮，群众勉强报了八百五十亩，结果实种才四百三十亩。区委并以整风精神号召大家提意见。在分组讨论中大家对领导上提了意见，暴露了对种棉的思想顾虑。有的人怕再淹死碱死，有的人顾虑没技术怕种不好，也有人还认为种棉花只收一季，没有种其他庄稼合算。
    这时会议便以实际算账的例子打通群众的思想，中王大村中共副支部书记卢秀英把自己地里的棉花拔来两棵让大家看，每棵都是四五十个棉桃。她告诉大家：第一棉花要种在好地。第二棉花是勤活，必须勤收拾。第三得懂技术，不懂就向人学。她算了算；三亩半棉花，每亩能收子棉二百多斤，合皮棉七十斤，能换小米七百多斤。其他有技术的，种棉有成绩的人也都纷纷向大家介绍自己的经验。这些实际例子提高了大家种棉信心。纠正了把棉花种在坏地的想法。干部们也认识到假报数字是不对的，他们说“咱们对上级不说实话，就是对群众不负责任。”大家分组研究了留出种棉地的问题，并决定回村后好好向群众解释宣传。
      （李荫澄、张野夫）
    编者按：建国一区区委以整风精神进行自我检讨，注意吸取下面干部群众的意见的精神是对的。但区委贯彻政策布置工作应通过各村支部党员干部，而不应直接召开村干部代表会议。这样党政不分一揽子的工作方式，一方面影响政府干部的工作积极性，一方面影响区委本身的工作，因之在整风期间应注意改正。
