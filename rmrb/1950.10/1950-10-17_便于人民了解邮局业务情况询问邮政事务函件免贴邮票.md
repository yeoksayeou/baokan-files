In order to enable the people to understand the postal services and postal knowledge, the Beijing Postal Administration, in addition to broadcasting postal services and postal knowledge on the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station (Municipal Voice Time, once every two weeks) and the Huasheng Broadcasting Station (now every Saturday from 8:15 AM to 8:30 AM), also publishes postal Q&A in the Xinmin Daily every Friday. In order to facilitate inquiries from all sectors, anyone with unclear matters regarding the post office can write to the Social Service Division of the Bureau without stamps, but must indicate their real name and address and mark "Postal Affairs" in the upper left corner of the envelope. All inquiries will be collated and synthesized, and then answered on the radio, in the newspaper, or by letter. For general sporadic events, please still use the telephone (5-4146) for inquiries to keep things simple.
