　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 27th: The Indian newspaper "National Herald" published an essay by Indian international affairs commentator Sun Jia, entitled "The United Nations Has Become a Puppet of the United States." The commentator cited many facts to prove the correctness of his assessment. He cited the US armed forces crossing the 38th parallel as an example, believing that "this is a very dangerous adventure concerning the fate of universal peace"; and said: "The US military authorities have long wanted to advance further, stationing troops along the Far Eastern border of the Soviet Union. This is the real reason for the decision to invade North Korea."

　　He said: "If a plebiscite had been held to decide whether the Allied forces (referring to the United Nations forces under US command) should invade North Korea, this proposal would inevitably have been defeated by a ratio of three to one. However, the proposal secretly put forward by the Americans was passed by the General Assembly with forty-seven votes to five." He then wrote: "It (referring to the United Nations) calls itself the United Nations Organization, but it passes resolutions that completely violate the wishes of the vast majority of people. ... Those who passed this proposal must have fully understood when voting that the General Assembly might be voting to plunge all mankind into a third world war. But this was finally done against the will of three-quarters of the people on earth."

　　Sun Jia pointed out: Another evidence that the United Nations has become a puppet of the United States is the issue of the People's Republic of China's attendance at the United Nations. "On this issue, the vast majority of the world, except for the Americas, supports the new China's attendance at the United Nations. International law also tends to favor the new China's attendance at the United Nations. Even the US government cannot raise any objections to China's participation. According to the UN Charter, all resolutions of the Security Council are illegal without the participation of the representatives of the real China. The US State Department has always opposed the new People's Republic of China's participation in the United Nations. Therefore, the Security Council acts according to the will of the United States and executes the orders of the US State Department that violate the wishes of the people of all countries in the world."

　　Sun Jia wrote: "The reason for all this is that Washington controls the voting in the Security Council and the United Nations."

　　The author then mentioned the Taiwan issue, saying: "The United States signed an agreement in 1945 stipulating that Formosa (Taiwan) would be returned to the Chinese government after Japan was defeated. But after Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan, the US State Department decided to place Taiwan under its "protection." This decision is nothing but interference in China's civil war."

　　Sun Jia believes that the US State Department's shameless manipulation of the United Nations has aroused dissatisfaction and even anger in British diplomatic circles. "However, whether the British government is happy or not, it still has to act according to Washington's orders. As far as Britain's prestige in Asia is concerned, there has never been a more shameful example than the British government's complete bankruptcy on the Korean issue. As for France, it is completely dependent on the United States."

### 印报斥美国操纵联合国  指出美国控制安理会和联合国的投票违背世界人民意志阻止我国代表出席

　　印报斥美国操纵联合国
    指出美国控制安理会和联合国的投票违背世界人民意志阻止我国代表出席
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社新德里二十七日讯：印度国民先驱报刊载了印度国际问题评论家孙迦所写的一篇论文，题为“联合国已变为美国的傀儡”。评论家引证许多事实，证明他的估计的正确。他举美国武装部队越过三八线的事情为例，认为“这是一个关乎普遍和平的命运的很危险的冒险”；并说：“美国的军事当局早就想再往前进，陈兵于苏联的远东边境一带，这就是通过入侵北朝鲜的决定的真正原因。”
    他说：“如果曾举行公民投票来决定盟国部队（按指美国指挥下的联合侵朝部队）是否要侵略北朝鲜的话，这个提案必然已以三对一之比遭到失败。但是，被美国人所悄悄地提出来的提案，却以四十七票对五票被大会通过。”他接着写道：“它（按指联合国）虽把自己叫作联合国组织，但却通过这种完全违背绝大多数人民的愿望的决议。……通过这个提案的人们在投票时必定充分地了解到：大会可能是在投票将全人类投入第三次世界大战。但是这终于在违背地球上四分之三人民的意志的情况下做了。”
    孙迦指出：联合国变成美国傀儡的另一证据，是中华人民共和国出席联合国的问题。“在这个问题上，全世界除了美洲以外，极大多数赞成新中国出席联合国。国际法也是倾向于赞成新中国出席联合国的。即使美国政府，也提不出任何意见来反对中国参加。根据联合国宪章，安理会的一切决议如果没有真正中国的代表的参加联合国，都是非法的。美国的国务院却始终反对新的中华人民共和国参加联合国。于是，安理会依照美国的意志行事，执行了美国国务院违背全世界各国人民愿望的命令。”
    孙迦写道：“产生这一切情况的原因是：华盛顿控制着安理会和联合国的投票。”
    作者随后提到台湾问题说：“美国曾在一九四五年签订一个协定，规定在日本打败后将福摩萨（台湾）交还给中国政府。但是在蒋介石逃到台湾以后，美国国务院决定将台湾放在它的“保护”之下。这个决定不是别的，而是干涉中国的内战。”
    孙迦认为：美国国务院的无耻地操纵联合国，在英国的外交界中引起了不满，甚至愤怒。“但是，不管英国政府是不是高兴，它还是得根据华盛顿的命令办事。对于英国在亚洲的威信说来，从来没有一个例子比英国政府在朝鲜问题上的彻底破产更来得丢脸。至于法国呢，它是完全依赖美国的。”
