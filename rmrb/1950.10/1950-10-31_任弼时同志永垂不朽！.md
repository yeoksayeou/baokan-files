　　Comrade Ren Bishi Will Live Forever!
    Rao Shushi
    The sad news of Comrade Ren Bishi's death has reached East China. All Communist Party members, all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, all members of the New Democratic Youth League, and patriotic people from all walks of life in East China express their deepest condolences.
    Comrade Ren Bishi dedicated his entire life to the great revolutionary cause of China's national liberation, people's liberation, and the liberation of the working class. He left indelible achievements during the Great Revolution of 1925-1927, the Land Revolution War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the People's Liberation War. His death is not only a serious loss for our party and the Chinese working class but also a serious loss for all the Chinese people.
    Comrade Ren Bishi's boundless loyalty to the Party, the working class, and the cause of the people, as well as his principled and self-sacrificing spirit in his work, are worthy of emulation by the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country. He demonstrated an exemplary communist's active support for the Party's revolutionary line in the struggle against Chen Duxiu's opportunist line and in the struggle against the traitor Zhang Guotao. He displayed the lofty integrity of a Communist in the prisons of the Kuomintang reactionary rulers and in the Western prisons of imperialism.
    Comrade Ren Bishi's great revolutionary fighting spirit and example encourage our confidence and determination to oppose enemies at home and abroad. Comrade Ren Bishi's "Several Questions in Land Reform" instructs us on the correct method to thoroughly eliminate the feudal system. Comrade Ren Bishi's report to the First National Congress of the New Democratic Youth League of China indicated the correct direction for Chinese youth. Comrade Ren Bishi has departed from us and passed away, but Comrade Ren Bishi's great revolutionary fighting spirit will live forever!
    In order to compensate for the loss caused by Comrade Ren Bishi's death, we call on all Party members in East China, all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, all members of the New Democratic Youth League, and all patriotic people in East China to transform grief into strength, unite under the strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by the Chinese people's leader Mao Zedong, and strive to oppose the aggression of American imperialism, consolidate the national defense of the People's Republic, and consolidate and develop the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution.

　　任弼时同志永垂不朽！
    饶漱石
    任弼时同志逝世的噩耗传到华东，华东区全体共产党员、人民解放军全体指战员、新民主主义青年团全体团员和华东各界爱国人民，均致深切哀悼。
    任弼时同志为中国的民族解放、人民解放和工人阶级解放的伟大革命事业而贡献了他的全部生命。他在一九二五至一九二七年大革命时期，在土地革命战争时候，在抗日战争时期和人民解放战争时期都留下了不可磨灭的功绩。他的逝世不但是我党与中国工人阶级的严重损失，而且也是全中国人民的严重损失。
    任弼时同志对党对工人阶级对人民事业的无限忠心，他在工作中的原则性和自我牺牲精神，值得全党全军和全国人民学习。他在反对陈独秀机会主义路线斗争中，在反对叛徒张国焘的斗争中，表现了共产党员积极拥护党的革命路线的范例。他在国民党反动统治者的监狱中，他在帝国主义的西牢中，表现了共产党人崇高的气节。
    任弼时同志的伟大的革命斗争精神和榜样，鼓励我们反对国内外敌人的信心和决心；任弼时同志所著《土地改革中的几个问题》，指示我们彻底消灭封建制度的正确方法；任弼时同志在中国新民主主义青年团第一次全国代表大会上的报告，给中国青年指示了正确的方向。任弼时同志是离开我们而长逝了，但任弼时同志的伟大革命斗争精神永垂不朽！
    为了补偿任弼时同志逝世所造成的损失，我们号召华东区全体党员，人民解放军全体指战员，新民主主义青年团全体团员和华东一切爱国人民，化悲痛为力量，一致团结在以中国人民领袖毛泽东为首的中国共产党的坚强领导下，为反对美帝国主义的侵略，巩固人民祖国的国防，巩固和发展中国人民革命的胜利而奋斗。
