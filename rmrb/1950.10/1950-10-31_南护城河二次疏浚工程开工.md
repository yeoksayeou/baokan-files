　　Second Dredging Project of the Southern Moat Starts
    The second dredging project of the southern moat in Beijing has commenced on the 19th of this month, starting from the section between Yongdingmen and Dongbianmen. The southern moat, which runs along the outer city wall from Xibianmen, passing Guang'an, You'an, Yongding, Zuo'an, and Guangqumen to Dongbianmen, is 15,841 meters long. It was dredged in April this year. After detailed research based on the actual experience of the rainy season, the Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau believes that the riverbed needs to be lowered by another 5 decimeters to 1 meter, and the river bottom needs to be widened to 12 meters in order to solve the problem of flood discharge from the upper reaches of the Southern Han River and Lianhua Pond during the rainy season, as well as the problem of sewage discharge from the sewers after the water level of the Southern Moat rises. Therefore, it was decided to dredge it again. The stone paving of the original drawbridges at Zuo'an and Guangqu gates, as well as the bridge openings along the river, will also be lowered to the original specified height. In order to protect the farms on both sides of the river, it was decided to build a river embankment 5 to 6 meters wide along the river. Thanks to the good solutions made in advance for drainage problems, the construction is progressing relatively smoothly. However, due to insufficient manpower recruitment, the project is only partially underway at present.

　　南护城河二次疏浚工程开工
    京市南护城河二次疏浚工程，已于本月十九日在永定门至东便门段开工。南护城河自西便门起沿外城城墙，经广安、右安、永定、左安、广渠各门至东便门止，全长一万五千八百四十一公尺，曾在今年四月进行疏浚，经市卫生工程局根据雨季实际经验，进行详细研究的结果，认为河床需再降低五公寸至一公尺，河底需加宽为十二公尺，才能解决雨季上游南旱河、莲花池洪水宣泄问题，及南护城河水位高涨后下水道的出水问题，因此决定再度加以疏浚。原有左安、广渠两门吊桥及沿河桥梁桥孔的海墁石也要按原来规定高度加以降低。为保护两岸田庄并决定在沿河修筑宽五、六米的河堤一道。由于这次施工事先对排水问题做了很好的解决，工程进行较比顺利，但因工力尚未募足目前工程只是部分展开。
