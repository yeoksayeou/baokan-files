　　UN Political Committee's 23rd Meeting
    Begins Discussion of Soviet Peace Proposal
    Vyshinsky Delivers Important Speech
    Points out that the flames of war are burning in Korea and other parts of the Far East, and new war instigators are threatening the interests of all mankind. The adoption of this proposal is of particularly great significance.
    [Xinhua News Agency, October 24th dispatch from New York] TASS, New York, October 23rd: After a short discussion, the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee decided at its morning session on October 23rd that the Political Committee should consider the issue of the obligations of states when military action begins and the establishment of a permanent arbitration committee as item four on the agenda. Subsequently, the Political Committee reviewed item three on the agenda, namely the Soviet delegation's proposal for a "Declaration on the Cessation of the Threat of a New War, and the Consolidation of World Peace and Security."
    The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, spoke for the entire morning session, and the audience listened attentively. In this speech, Vyshinsky presented the Soviet proposal.
    When Vyshinsky spoke, he first recalled that on September 20th of this year, the Soviet delegation had already submitted to the General Assembly its proposal aimed at stopping the threat of a new war and consolidating world peace and security. The Soviet representatives had repeatedly spoken at the plenary session of the General Assembly, and had outlined the main reasons that prompted the Soviet government to submit this draft declaration to the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly.
    The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, emphasized that the flames of war are currently burning in Korea and other parts of the Far East, and new war instigators continue to unceasingly threaten the interests and happiness of all mankind. Under such an international situation, the adoption of this declaration would have particularly great significance. Vyshinsky declared that, on the other hand, millions of working people are raising their voices in protest with unprecedented force against the preparations for a new war, and are urging their governments to take resolute measures to consolidate peace, stop the threat of a new war, and guarantee international security.
    The Soviet Government's Consistent Foreign Policy is to Strengthen Peace and International Cooperation
    The head of the Soviet delegation further emphasized that the proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation are aimed at realizing the purposes and principles of the United Nations as stipulated in the United Nations Charter. Vyshinsky pointed out that the advocacy of peace is the central theme of the entire draft declaration. The preamble to the declaration emphasizes that the various events now occurring in Korea and other parts of the Pacific once again powerfully prove that the common peaceful efforts of the five permanent members of the Security Council, who bear special responsibility for maintaining international peace, are of particular importance for peace and international security.
    Vyshinsky also emphasized that, regardless of all the obstacles standing in the way of strengthening peace and international cooperation, the Soviet Union is still unswervingly and firmly following this path, firmly believing that this is fully in line with the hopes of the Soviet people and the people of all other peace-loving countries, and in line with the interests of all mankind.
    Vyshinsky then explained the principles of Soviet foreign policy, proving that Soviet foreign policy has always been aimed at peace. The head of the Soviet delegation cited many facts and documents from Soviet history and foreign policy to prove that the Soviet government has consistently and resolutely carried out the struggle for peace. Vyshinsky convincingly demonstrated that Soviet foreign policy steadfastly pursues the goals that are in line with the fundamental interests of the Soviet people and all peace-loving countries.
    Vyshinsky cited Stalin's remarks on Soviet foreign policy and the Soviet Union's willingness to cooperate with countries belonging to another social system. Vyshinsky quoted Stalin's remarks when receiving the first American workers' delegation in 1927, and Stalin's replies to A. Weiss and Roosevelt, as well as K. Smith in 1946.
    US and British Governments Pursue Policies of Force, Actions Contradict Words, Undermine International Obligations
    Vyshinsky then cited facts to expose the aggressive and imperialistic nature of the foreign policies of the United States and Britain, whose governments pursue policies of force, policies implemented with pressure and orders, and policies backed by land, sea and air forces. Vyshinsky also cited conclusive facts to prove that the words and deeds of American and British diplomats are inconsistent. He pointed out that the United States is undermining its international obligations, especially the Yalta and Potsdam agreements.
    At this point, the head of the Soviet delegation made a thorough analysis of Acheson's and Bevin's public statements, as well as President Truman's recent speech in San Francisco, proving that these talks are full of worship of force. Vyshinsky said: Worship of force, worship of the atomic bomb, this is the driving force in diplomatic relations declared by the leaders of the American and British groups, and the main lever of their entire foreign policy.
    Vyshinsky emphasized that this policy of force will not have any effect on the Soviet Union at all. Vyshinsky said that those who advocate a policy of force should choose another object for this experiment. Vyshinsky also reminded everyone to pay attention to the huge-scale arms movement and the increasing military spending caused by the policy of force.
    The War Mongers of the Aggressive Bloc Forget That Bombs Can Be Retaliated With Bombs
    Vyshinsky exposed those who oppose cooperation with the Soviet Union, who oppose the various proposals put forward by the Soviet government, especially the proposals on disarmament. According to them, international trust must be restored before these proposals can be implemented. Vyshinsky said: That is the same formula used by the League of Nations in those years: security first, then disarmament. The League of Nations did not solve the problem of security. On the contrary, it was precisely because of this security problem that the solution of many other problems was hindered. Vyshinsky explained: Now they want to use the same method, using the issue of "trust," to avoid cooperating with the Soviet Union. Vyshinsky exposed the war mongers' unwillingness to agree to ban atomic weapons - the most inhuman and barbaric tool of war. He explained that all the calculations of these war mongers are unreliable, and they have forgotten that bombs can be retaliated with bombs.
    In the second part of his speech, Vyshinsky explained in detail the basic principles stipulated in the "Declaration on the Cessation of the Threat of a New War, and the Consolidation of World Peace and Security." He elaborated on the Soviet proposal on the control of atomic energy. He also said: While the Soviet Union is making every effort to reach an agreement on issues related to the use of atomic energy, the United States stubbornly insists on the unacceptable Baruch Plan.
    In concluding his speech, the head of the Soviet delegation pointed out that the draft declaration proceeds from the need to consolidate peace, and takes into account the special responsibilities of the Security Council and its permanent members, as well as the responsibilities of all other members of the organization. Vyshinsky reiterated at the end of his speech that the adoption of the Soviet proposal will give a decisive blow to all the aggressive conspiracies and plans of the war mongers, and will make a great contribution to the consolidation of peace and security. The Soviet delegation calls on all other delegations to do the same. After Vyshinsky finished his speech, the morning session was adjourned.

　　联大政治委员会二十三日会议
    开始讨论苏联和平提案
    维辛斯基发表重要演说
    指出目前朝鲜及远东其他地区战火燃烧，新战争挑拨者正威胁全人类的利益，通过这项提案有特别重大意义。
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社纽约二十三日讯：联合国大会政治委员会十月二十三日上午会议经过短时间讨论后决定：政委会应将关于当军事行动开始时各国所应担负的义务及建立永久性仲裁委员会的问题列为第四项议程审议。随后政委会即审议议程第三项，即苏联代表团所提“制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全的宣言”案。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基发言占上午会议全部时间，听众甚为注意。维辛斯基在这篇演说中提出了苏联的提案。
    维辛斯基发言时，首先追述说：本年九月二十日苏联代表团即已向大会提出其旨在制止新战争威胁，巩固世界和平与安全的提案。苏联各代表在大会全体会议上屡次发言，已概略说明促使苏联政府决定向联合国大会第五届会议提出这项宣言草案的主要原因。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基着重指出：目前朝鲜及远东其他地区战火燃烧，新战争挑拨者继续不停地威胁全人类的利益及幸福。在这种国际局势下，通过这项宣言，会有特别重大的意义。维辛斯基宣称：另一方面，千百万的劳动人民正在以空前的力量大声提出抗议，反对新战争准备，力促他们的政府采取坚决不渝的措施，以巩固和平，制止新战争威胁，保障国际安全。
    苏联政府一贯外交政策是加强和平与国际合作
    苏联代表团团长又着重指出，苏联代表团所提出的各项建议旨在实现联合国宪章中所规定的联合国的宗旨与原则。维辛斯基指出，争取和平的主张是整个宣言草案的主旨。宣言序文着重说明，现在在朝鲜及太平洋其他地区所发生的各种事件再次有力证明，对维持国际和平负有特别责任的安理会五个常任理事国共同的和平努力，对于和平与国际安全是特别至为重要的。
    维辛斯基又着重指出，不管横在加强和平与国际合作道路上的一切障碍，苏联仍是始终不渝地、坚定地遵循这条道路，深信这是完全符合苏联人民及其他一切爱好和平国家的人民的希望，符合全人类的利益的。
    维辛斯基进而解释苏联外交政策的原则，证明苏联外交政策一向以和平为目的。苏联代表团团长引用苏联历史及外交政策中的许多事实与文件，证明苏联政府一贯坚决进行争取和平的斗争。维辛斯基令人信服地证明，苏联外交政策坚定不移地追求着符合苏联人民与一切爱好和平国家之基本利益的目的。
    维辛斯基援引了斯大林关于苏联外交政策及苏联愿与属于另一个社会制度的国家合作的谈话。维辛斯基引用斯大林在一九二七年接见第一个美国工人代表团时的谈话，及一九四六年斯大林对Ａ·威斯和小罗斯福以及Ｋ·史密斯的答复。
    美英政府奉行武力政策言行不符破坏国际义务
    维辛斯基继而引用事实，揭露美、英外交政策侵略性的帝国主义特质，它们的政府奉行着武力政策，以压力和命令来实行的政策，以陆海空军为后盾的政策。维辛斯基又引用确凿的事实，证明美英外交官的言行不符。他指出美国破坏其国际义务，尤其是雅尔达与波茨坦协议。
    至此，苏联代表团团长对艾奇逊与贝文的公开声明以及杜鲁门总统最近在旧金山发表的演说作一透彻分析，证明这些谈话中充满着对武力的崇拜。维辛斯基说：崇拜武力，崇拜原子弹，这就是美英集团的领袖们所宣称的外交关系中的动力，就是他们整个外交政策的主要杠杆。
    维辛斯基着重指出：这种武力政策对苏联是完全不会产生什么效果的。维辛斯基说，武力政策的鼓吹者们要作这种实验，应该选择另外的对象。维辛斯基又提醒大家注意巨大规模的军备运动及因武力政策而造成的军事开支的日益增加。
    侵略集团的战争贩子们忘了炸弹可用炸弹回敬
    维辛斯基揭露了那些反对与苏联合作的人，他们反对苏联政府所提出的各项建议，特别是关于裁减军备的建议，照他们说来，必须先恢复国际信任，然后才能实行这些建议。维辛斯基说：那是和当年国际联盟所用的一样的公式：先是安全，然后才是裁军。国际联盟并未解决安全的问题，相反地，正因为这个安全问题而阻挠了许多其他问题的解决。维辛斯基说明：现在他们想用同样的方法，利用“信任”这个问题，避免与苏联合作。维辛斯基揭露了战争贩子们不愿同意禁止原子武器——最惨无人道、最野蛮的战争工具。他说明了这些战争贩子们的一切算盘都是不可靠的，他们忘记了炸弹是可以用炸弹来回敬的。
    维辛斯基在他的演说的第二部分中详细解释“制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全的宣言”中所规定的基本原则。他详尽地论述了苏联关于管制原子能的提案。他还说：在苏联不遗余力地想在与使用原子能有关的问题上达成协议时，美国却固执地坚持不能令人接受的巴鲁区计划。
    苏联代表团团长在结束他的演说时指出：宣言草案是从巩固和平的需要出发的，考虑到了安全理事会及其常任理事国的特殊责任与该组织所有的其他会员国的责任。维辛斯基在演说末尾再一次强调地说：通过苏联的提案将予战争贩子的一切侵略阴谋与计划以一个断然的打击，对于巩固和平与安全将有极大的贡献。苏联代表团号召所有的其他代表团一致这样做。在维辛斯基演说完毕后，上午的会议乃休会。
