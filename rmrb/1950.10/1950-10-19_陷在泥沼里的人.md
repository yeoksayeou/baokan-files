　　A Person Trapped in the Mud
    Deng Yanlin
    American imperialism's frenzied aggression against Korea is a cause for great self-satisfaction. But it reminds me of a fable by Aesop.
    This story is called "The Little Mudhole," and it describes a person trapped in a mudhole from struggling to death. The general idea is as follows:
    One day, a reckless and irritable person fell into a mudhole. Half of his body was lying slanting, and his right ankle was also trapped in the mud. At first, he didn't care, thinking it was just a small mudhole, and the soil was soft. But the sloppy mud played a trick on him, smearing the gentleman's head and face, turning him into a mud man and making his face lose its luster. He felt angry and annoyed, and wanted to show off his power and stand up from the mudhole. So he tried to lean to the left, but as a result, his left foot also got stuck in the mud.
    "This damn mudhole!" he cursed, while struggling like a crazy beast. He wanted to lift his left foot, but his right foot sank deeper into the mud; he wanted to lift his right foot, but his left foot sank even deeper into the mud. He struggled with both feet at the same time, and the mud gradually rose to his legs and his abdomen. At this time, he felt panicked and wanted to use his hands to support himself and struggle out of the mudhole, but his arms swayed, and the mud tightly clamped his arms. His mouth frantically shouted, and the mud filled his mouth. His nose breathed with difficulty, and the mud drilled into his nostrils. In this way, he struggled frantically until the mud buried the top of his head. Later, only a few strands of hair were seen floating above the mudhole, like a clump of aquatic plants...

　　陷在泥沼里的人
    邓燕林
    美帝国主义疯狂侵略朝鲜，得意得很。但我却想起伊索寓言里的一个故事来。
    这篇故事叫做“小小的泥沼”，描写一个陷在泥沼里的人从挣扎到死亡的情形。大意如下：
    一天，有一个鲁莽而暴躁的人，跌倒在一个泥沼里。他的半身倾斜地躺卧着，右脚踝也给陷进泥泞里面。他最初毫不在意，认为这不过是一个小小的泥沼，而且泥土也是松松软软的。可是稀烂的泥浆，偏偏开了他的玩笑，把这位先生涂抹得满头满脸，简直变成一个泥人，使他的脸上大失光彩。他觉得又气又恼，一心想显显威风，从泥沼中站立起来。于是用力往左一歪，结果连左脚也给陷进泥泞里了。
    “这个鬼泥沼！”他咒骂着，同时像一头疯狂的野兽一样挣扎着。他想举起左脚，右脚就更深地给陷进了泥泞里；他想举起右脚，左脚又更深地陷进了泥泞里。他两只脚同时用力挣扎，泥泞就渐渐升到他的腿部，升到他的腹部了。这时候他心里恐慌起来，想用两只手支撑着，从泥沼中挣扎出来，他的臂膀摇动，泥泞就紧紧地箝住了他的臂膀。他的嘴巴疯狂呼喊，泥泞就寒满了他的嘴巴。他的鼻子困难地呼吸着，泥泞就钻进了他的鼻孔。这样，他一直疯狂地挣扎着，直到泥泞埋没了他的头顶为止。后来，只看见几根毛发，像一丛水草一样，在泥沼的上面飘浮着。……
