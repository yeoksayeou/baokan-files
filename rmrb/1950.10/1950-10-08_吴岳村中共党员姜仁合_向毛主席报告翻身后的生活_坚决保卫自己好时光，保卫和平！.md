　　Wu Yue Village Communist Party Member Jiang Renhe
Reports to Chairman Mao on His Life After Emancipation
Resolutely Defending His Good Times and Peace!
[Our Newspaper] During the national celebration of National Day, Jiang Renhe, a Communist Party member from Wu Yue Village, Ren County, Hebei Province, wrote to Chairman Mao to report on his emancipation. In his letter, he expressed his heartfelt gratitude for Chairman Mao's wise leadership. The original letter is as follows:

Dear Chairman Mao:

　　I used to be penniless. My father worked as a hired hand for the landlord all his life, suffering, and died with nothing to his name. But I was even worse off than him. I lost both my parents at the age of twelve. I had no house to live in and had to sleep in the temple with the clay idols.

　　At that time, I was young and had no means of living, so I had to herd sheep for the landlord. In the twelfth lunar month, the northwest wind carried goose feather snow, and I wore a thin, small cotton jacket full of holes. My feet were frozen with sores, and I walked with a limp. The landlord still said, "You little devil, you're pretending. If you don't work hard, I'll kick you out!" Once, I was sick and no one cared for me, so I went hungry. When the landlord's mule was sick, he hired a doctor and gave it medicine. At that time, I was really worse off than the landlord's livestock.

　　In 1935, the Red Army guerrillas fought local tyrants and rescued the poor here. I was extremely happy and immediately joined the grain distribution team. But before long, the reactionary forces suppressed us. I was forced to flee to Shanxi. The Anti-Japanese War broke out, and I returned home. The head of the "Rich Household Group" (the landlord's organization) in our village, San Wu's family, saw me and said that I was a menace to the rich and always wanted to kill me. When the Japanese devils occupied the county seat, they sent me to "work." I ran away on the way the Japanese devils were transporting us to the Northeast. I didn't dare go home, so I had to wander around and beg for food.

　　In 1945, the Communist Party liberated Ren County and led the poor to fight against the traitors and local bullies. I was so happy that I couldn't sleep. I united the poor brothers and sisters to fight against the traitors and local bully landlord, San Wu's family. We were victorious. I received two bags of grain and two mu of land. I thought: I worked as a hired hand for more than ten years and didn't earn even a ridge of land. Today, I have food and land, and I will never forget the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

　　In 1947, land reform was carried out again. I became a representative of the peasant association and joined the Communist Party. The poor brothers and sisters worked together to overthrow the landlords and completely turned themselves over. This time, I received four mu of land and five brick houses. The government stipulates that single men should be taken care of and given the share of two people so that they can marry a wife in the future. Chairman Mao: You are so thoughtful!

　　The following winter, I got married. My wife can spin, weave, and work in the fields. This year, we had a fat baby in the first month. Chairman Mao! Under your wise leadership, life is getting better and better!

　　On October 1st last year, the People's Republic of China was born. This is the greatest happy event in thousands of years. I went to the city to attend the celebration meeting, and I came back with even greater enthusiasm. This year, I actively responded to the government's call to increase grain and cotton production. I got up at the fifth watch to collect manure and green fertilizer, and as a result, I put four large carts of manure on each mu of land. The land was plowed three times and harrowed five times. Our area is not originally a cotton-growing area. When planting cotton, not only did I plant two mu myself, but I also mobilized others to plant thirteen mu. After the summer harvest, I dried the good wheat and winnowed it clean and handed over the public grain. And I used the method of comparing with the public grain to promote more than 30 households to become models. Our mutual aid group is also doing well, achieving labor-saving and more output, and we also bought a big ox together. We also plan to buy a waterwheel together to turn dry land into paddy fields. This year, I harvested more than 1,900 jin of grain and can also pick 300 jin of cotton.

　　Chairman Mao: You lead hundreds of millions of poor people like me all over China to turn themselves over and move towards a happy life. I believe that under your wise leadership, we will become richer in the future.

　　However, the US imperialists do not want us to live a good life, and they want to expand the war of aggression. I resolutely oppose the US imperialist war of aggression. I want peace and I want to defend peace. I participated in the peace signature campaign and also mobilized 37 neighboring households to sign. Chairman Mao: Today is the first anniversary of the birth of New China. I am telling you what is in my heart as a gift! Finally, I want to shout:

　　Long live Chairman Mao!

　　Jiang Renhe, Wu Yue Village, Ren County, Hebei Province, October 1st

　　吴岳村中共党员姜仁合
    向毛主席报告翻身后的生活
    坚决保卫自己好时光，保卫和平！
    【本报讯】在全国欢度国庆之际，河北省任县吴岳村中共党员姜仁合，上书毛主席，报告他翻身的情形。信中对毛主席的英明领导，表示由衷的感谢。原信如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    我过去一贫如洗，爹给地主扛活、受苦一辈子，临死落了个赤手空拳。可是我比他更苦，十二岁上没了双亲，没房子住，只好和泥胎作伴，睡在庙里。
    这时，我年纪小，生活没有着落，只好给地主放羊。腊月里，西北风卷着鹅毛大雪，我穿着满身窟隆的薄小袄，脚冻成疮，走路一拐一拐的，地主还说：“你这小鬼胎装蒜，不好好干叫你滚蛋！”有一次我病了没人管，就饿着。地主的骡子病了，又请医生又吃药。那时，真不如地主的牲口。
    一九三五年，红军游击队在我们这里打土豪救穷人，我高兴极了，马上参加了分粮队。可是不长时间，就被反动队伍压下去了。我被迫逃到山西。抗日战争爆发了，我才回家。我村“富户团”（地主的组织）的头子三吴家，看见我，说我是富人的害，总想杀害我。到日本鬼子占了县城，他们就把我送去“做工”。鬼子把我们运往东北的路上，我就跑了，不敢回家只好到处流浪、要饭。
    一九四五年，共产党解放了任县，又领导穷人反汉奸反恶霸。我高兴的睡也睡不着，串连了穷兄弟团结起来，向汉奸恶霸地主三吴家进行了斗争。我们胜利了。我分到了两口袋谷子、二亩地。我想：扛活十多年，没挣得一垅地，今天有了吃有了地，永远也忘不了共产党和毛主席。
    一九四七年又进行了土地改革，我当了农会代表，我参加了共产党。穷兄弟们一股劲把地主打倒，翻透了身。这次我又分到四亩地、五间砖房。政府规定照顾单身汉，一个人分两个人的，将来好娶个媳妇。毛主席：您想的真周到！
    第二年冬天，我结了婚，老婆能纺花、织布，也能下地生产。今年正月我们又生下个胖娃娃。毛主席呵！在你英明领导下，光景越过越好了！
    去年十月一日，中华人民共和国诞生。这是几千年来的大喜事。我到城里参加庆祝大会，回来劲头更大了。今年我积极响应了政府增产粮棉的号召，起五更拾粪压青肥，结果每亩地上了四大车。地耕了三遍又耙了五遍。我们这里本不是种棉区，种棉花时，不光我自己种了二亩，还动员别人种了十三亩。夏收后我把好的麦子晒干簸净，交了公粮。并用比公粮的办法，推动了三十多户当了模范。我们的互助组搞的也不错，做到了省工多出活，还伙买了一头大牛。我们还计划伙买水车，把旱田变成水田。今年我打了一千九百多斤粮食，还能摘三百斤棉花。
    毛主席：你领导全中国千千万万像我一样的穷人翻身走向幸福的生活。我相信在你英明的领导下，今后我们会更富裕起来。
    但是，美帝国主义不愿意我们过好日子，它想扩大侵略战争。我坚决反对美帝的侵略战争，我要和平，我要保卫和平。我参加了和平签名，还动员三十七户邻家也签了名。毛主席：今天新中国诞生一周年了，我把心里话告诉你，作为献礼吧！最后我要高喊：
    毛主席万岁！
         河北省任县吴岳村姜仁合  十月一日
