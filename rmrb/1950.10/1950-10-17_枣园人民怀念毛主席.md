　　The People of Zao Yuan Cherish the Memory of Chairman Mao
　　Heng Qun
　　We took Chairman Mao’s latest photograph to visit the people of Zao Yuan in Yan’an.
　　We sat down in front of a cave dwelling belonging to a man named Wang Dehui. Old man Wang was stripping hemp, and when he saw us, he welcomed us with his kind eyes. He said, "Yuansheng, Yuansheng, bring a bowl of water!" The name of this little child, "Yuansheng," caught our attention, and the conversation began. It turned out that the child was born in the "Central Hospital." Old man Wang said, "When Chairman Mao lived here, the women all went to the Central Hospital to give birth." As soon as Chairman Mao was mentioned, the woman who was cooking in the cave also came out. She patted Yuansheng’s head and asked, "Do you still remember Chairman Mao?" Yuansheng then opened his eyes wide and looked at the picture of Chairman Mao in the Xinhua Daily that we brought. Then he snatched the newspaper, shouting "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao!" and ran into the cave to show it to the other children. The woman explained to us, "He was too young when Chairman Mao was here, he doesn’t remember!" Old man Wang laughed when he heard this, and said, "Almost everyone in the village has seen Chairman Mao. I saw him when Chairman Mao congratulated me on my birthday, a tall man!" For a long time, we didn't speak any further. Old man Wang’s eyes were looking down the mountain, he was remembering Chairman Mao! Below the mountain, there was a lush green field of crops. Old man Wang turned around and said to us, "When Chairman Mao lived here, below (he pointed to the crops) was all irrigated land, and the crops grew very well. After the Hu Zongnan bandit troops came, all the irrigated land was destroyed... This year there is a drought, and the crops are not growing well. If it were irrigated land, we wouldn’t have to be afraid of the drought." The common people are most concerned about the crops, and when they mention these, they immediately think of Chairman Mao. The old man continued, "Chairman Mao was very concerned about our production when he lived here, and often asked us what difficulties we had; as soon as the common people got sick, a doctor named Zhou would come running immediately. During weeding and harvesting, Chairman Mao would send many cadres to help the common people weed or harvest. They were just like our family members, except they didn't eat our food, and they left as soon as they were done." The old man smiled, looking at our gray uniforms.
　　In 1947, when the Hu Zongnan bandit troops attacked the border region, they destroyed the good life of the people of Zao Yuan. More than half of the people fled, leaving only fifteen or sixteen households, cultivating more than seventy mu of land. All the livestock were taken away. Now the situation is gradually recovering. The number of households in the village has increased to fifty-three, cultivating a total of more than two thousand four hundred and eighty mu of land. Cattle, donkeys, chickens, pigs, etc. are also gradually increasing. If we hadn't suffered from hail last year, and if it hadn't been a drought this year, the village's production would soon catch up to pre-war levels.
　　After the midday break, many villagers surrounded us, vying to see Chairman Mao’s photograph. Young Gao Nengzhi said, "My father has seen Chairman Mao, and even ate at the same table with him and shook his hand." Then a group of old men began to talk about Chairman Mao inviting them to dinner and watching the yangko during the New Year. They all expressed their love for Chairman Mao from the bottom of their hearts. Sun Yongju is an old man who was congratulated on his birthday by Chairman Mao and planted trees with Chairman Mao. He said, "We all miss Chairman Mao because he knows about the affairs of the common people, and he can help them. When the enemy occupied this village, everyone in the village looked forward to Chairman Mao!"
　　How the people of Zao Yuan love Chairman Mao! The cave dwelling where Chairman Mao once lived, the trees he planted with his own hands, the small roads he walked... As long as you see all this, you will miss Chairman Mao.
　　People cannot live without Chairman Mao, they cannot forget Chairman Mao!

### 枣园人民怀念毛主席

　　枣园人民怀念毛主席
    恒群
    我们带着毛主席最近的像片，去拜访延安枣园的人民。
    在一位名叫王德会的窑洞前，我们坐下了。王老汉正在剥麻，看见我们来了，便用那亲切的眼光欢迎我们。他说：“院生，院生，拿水碗来！”“院生”这一小娃娃的名字，引起了我们的注意。于是话就拉开了。原来因为这孩子是在“中央医院”生的。王老汉说：“毛主席住在这里时，婆姨都到中央医院去生娃娃。”一提起毛主席，正在窑里做饭的婆姨也走出来了。她拍着院生的脑袋问：“你还记得毛主席不？”院生便睁大了他的眼睛，看着我们带去的新华日报上毛主席的像片。接着他又把报纸抢过去，嘴里嚷着“毛主席，毛主席！”地跑进窑里给别的娃娃看去了。婆姨向我们解释说：“毛主席在这里时，他还小呢，记不得了！”王老汉听着笑了，他说：“村里人差不多都见过毛主席。毛主席给我们老汉祝寿时，我看见了他，高高的大个子！”半天我们没有再拉话。王老汉的眼睛朝山下望着，他是在回想着毛主席哩！山下，是一片绿油油的庄稼。王老汉转回身子对我们说：“毛主席住在这里时，下边（他用手指着庄稼）都是水地，庄稼长得可好咧。胡宗南匪军来到以后，这一片水地全叫破坏了……今年天旱，庄稼长得不大好，要是水地就不用怕天旱了。”老百姓最关心的就是庄稼，而他们一提到这些，就马上想起毛主席来了。老汉接着又说：“毛主席在这里时很关心我们的生产，常常问我们有啥困难；老百姓一有病，一位姓周的医生就马上跑来。锄草和收割的时候，毛主席就派来好多干部帮助老百姓锄草或收割。他们就像咱们家里人一样，只是不吃我们的东西，做完就走。”老汉笑了，两眼望着我们的灰制服。
    一九四七年胡宗南匪军进攻边区时，一下把枣园人民的好光景破坏了。人们逃走了一半多，只剩下十五、六户人家，种着七十多亩地。牲口全都被拉走了。现在光景又渐渐地恢复过来了。全村户数已增加到五十三户，共种地二千四百八十多亩，牛、驴、鸡、猪等也都渐渐增多起来。假使去年不遭冷子（雹）打，今年天不旱，村里的生产，便快赶上战前了。
    歇晌以后，好多老乡围住了我们，争着看毛主席的像片。青年高能治说：“我大（父亲）见过毛主席，还和他在一个桌上吃过饭，拉过手。”于是一群老汉便谈起了毛主席过年请他们吃饭、看秧歌的事来。他们都从心底里流露出对毛主席的热爱。孙永聚是一位被毛主席祝过寿，和毛主席一起种过树的老汉。他说：“我们大家都想念着毛主席，因为老百姓的事他都知道，他都能帮助。敌人占领这村时，村里便人人盼着毛主席！”
    枣园人民是怎样地热爱着毛主席啊！毛主席曾经住过的窑洞，亲手栽种的树，走过的小路……只要看到这一切，谁都会怀念起毛主席来。
    人们离不开毛主席，忘不了毛主席！
