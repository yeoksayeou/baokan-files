　　Strive to Oppose the US Imperialists' Expansion of the War of Aggression Against Korea
    Jiu San Society
    In order to salvage the disastrous defeat of its war of aggression against Korea, the US imperialists have successively mobilized 140,000 troops, more than 300 warships, and more than 500 aircraft, landing at Incheon, Korea. After half a month of bitter fighting and at a great cost, they have become mired in Seoul. On the other hand, on October 7th, at the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, they secretly manipulated the majority voting machine, illegally passing the bloody proposal of eight countries, including the UK and Australia, authorizing the US imperialists to invade the entire Korea, and rejected the just proposal of the Soviet Union and other five countries for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Then, they crossed the 38th parallel, expanded the scope of the war of aggression against Korea, and attempted to extend the flames of war to the Chinese border.
    We, the Chinese people, cannot tolerate such frantic behavior of the US imperialists in their death throes. At the same time, their dream of expanding the war to weaken the strength of the world's democratic camp is absolutely impossible to realize.
    First, since shaking off the shackles of Japan, the Korean people have been carrying out the unification and construction of their motherland. They will absolutely resist the aggression of the US imperialists, and they will absolutely not allow the US imperialists to add the chains of semi-colonialism to them. If the US imperialists want to use what they consider to be their strong military force to overwhelm Korea, then please look at the fate of Hitler and Chiang Kai-shek. What was it? The reactionary military force cannot withstand a single blow from the people's power.
    Second, the US imperialists crossed the 38th parallel and expanded the war of aggression against Korea, they intentionally spread the flames of war to our country's borders. Premier Zhou said it well: "The Chinese people love peace, but in order to defend peace, they have never been and will never be afraid of resisting wars of aggression." The US imperialists must recognize that the Chinese people have already driven the US imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which they support with force, out of the mainland, and have stood up strongly, and will never allow any foreign aggression again. Whoever dares to act recklessly will bear the serious consequences.
    At present, nearly a quarter of the world's people have signed the peace declaration, and this signature will grow stronger day by day and hour by hour. These hundreds of millions of peace supporters have formed an incomparably great force as strong as steel, which will be enough to strike at the frantic actions of the US imperialists. We hope that the people of the whole country will unite firmly and, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, strengthen national defense and production construction, smash the US imperialists' conspiracies and schemes to expand the war of aggression against Korea, and defend our beautiful border areas!

　　为反对美帝扩大侵朝战争而奋斗
    九三学社
    美帝为挽救侵朝战争的惨败，先后动员十四万大军，三百多艘军舰，五百多架飞机，在朝鲜仁川登陆，苦战半月，于付出极大代价后，泥足陷入了汉城。另方面又在十月七日联合国五届大会里暗中操纵多数表决机器，非法通过英澳等八国授权美帝侵略整个朝鲜的血腥提案，否决了苏联等五国和平解决朝鲜问题的公正提案。接着，就越过三八线，扩大侵朝战争的范围，企图把战争的火焰，延烧到中国边境。
    我们中国人民对美帝这种垂死挣扎的疯狂行为，是不能容许的。同时它想扩大战争，以削弱世界民主阵容力量的迷梦，是绝对无法实现的。
    第一，朝鲜人民自从挣脱了日本的枷锁后，正在进行其祖国的统一和建设工作。他们要绝对反抗美帝的侵略，他们绝对不容许美帝在他们身上再加上半殖民地的锁链。美帝想借自以为雄厚的武力，来压倒朝鲜，那么，请看希特勒和蒋介石的下场，究竟是怎样？反动的武力，是经不起人民力量一击的。
    第二，美帝越过三八线，扩大侵朝战争，它们是有意将战火蔓延到我们的国境。周总理说得好：“中国人民热爱和平，但是为了保卫和平，从不也永不害怕反抗侵略战争。”美帝要认清：中国人民已经把美帝，和它用武力支持的蒋介石匪帮逐出大陆，并且坚强地站起来了，绝不容许再有任何外力的侵略，谁要妄动，谁便要担当严重的后果。
    目前全世界已经有近四分之一的人民在和平宣言上签名，而且这签名将一天比一天壮大，一小时比一小时壮大，这亿万和平拥护者，形成了和钢铁一般地无比的伟大力量，将足以打击美帝的疯狂行动。我们希望全国人民坚强的团结一致，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，加强国防和生产建设，粉碎美帝扩大侵朝的诡计阴谋，保卫我们的锦绣边疆！
