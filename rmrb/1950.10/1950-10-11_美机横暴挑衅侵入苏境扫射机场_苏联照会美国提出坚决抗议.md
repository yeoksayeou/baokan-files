　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 10th: TASS, Moscow: Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Gromyko received Mr. Barbour, Counselor of the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union, on the 9th and delivered a note which stated:
    “The Soviet Government declares to the United States Government: On October 8th (local time) at 16:17, two American Air Force Meteor (F-80) fighter planes brazenly violated the Soviet border, flying at low altitude over the coastal airport of Sukaya-Vachika in Soviet territory, 100 kilometers from the Soviet-Korean border, and strafed the airport with machine guns, causing damage to the airport's facilities.
    The Soviet Government hereby lodges a strong protest with the United States Government against this provocative act. The Soviet Government firmly demands that those responsible for the attack on the Soviet airport be severely punished, and hopes that the United States will guarantee that necessary measures will be taken to prevent similar provocative acts from happening in the future.
    The Soviet Government considers it necessary to state that the United States Government shall bear full responsibility for the consequences arising from such actions by the American Air Force.”
    Barbour stated that since United Nations forces were operating in Korea, this matter supposedly had to be dealt with through the United Nations organization. Under this pretext, Barbour refused to accept the note.
    Gromyko pointed out that Barbour's statement was groundless, because the central issue of the Soviet Government's note was the strafing of a Soviet airport by the American Air Force, and not the aircraft of other countries. Therefore, the American military authorities under the control of the United States Government must of course be held responsible for this provocative act.
    The Soviet Foreign Ministry has already delivered the aforementioned note to the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union on the same day.

　　美机横暴挑衅侵入苏境扫射机场
    苏联照会美国提出坚决抗议
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部副部长葛罗米柯九日接见美国驻苏联大使馆参赞巴波尔，递交照会一件。照会称：
    “苏联政府向美国政府声明：在十月八日（当地时间）十六时十七分，美国空军流星式（Ｆ——八十）战斗机两架曾横暴地侵犯了苏联的国界，低空飞向苏联境内距苏联朝鲜国界一百公里的苏卡亚——华契卡地区的海滨飞机场，并用机枪向飞机场扫射，使飞机场的设备遭受了损害。
    苏联政府特向美国政府坚决抗议此种挑衅行为。苏联政府坚决要求严惩应对袭击苏联飞机场事件负责的人员，并希望美国保证采取必要的措施，以防止今后发生类似的挑衅行为。
    苏联政府认为必须声明：美国政府应对美国空军这种行动所引起的后果负完全责任。”
    巴波尔表示现在联合国军队正在朝鲜作战，这个问题据说必须向联合国组织交涉。巴波尔并且在这种借口之下拒绝接受照会。
    葛罗米柯指出：巴波尔的说法是毫无根据的，因为苏联政府照会的中心问题是美国空军而不是其他国家的飞机扫射苏联飞机场，因此，美国政府控制之下的美国军事当局当然必须对这种挑衅行为负责。
    苏联外交部已于同日将上述照会送交美国驻苏联大使馆。
