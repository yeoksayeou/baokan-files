　　Continue Adjusting Industry and Commerce, Increase Agricultural Production, Learn Trade Work.
　　Bo Yibo
　　Today is the first National Day of the People's Republic of China, and the entire army and people are celebrating enthusiastically. The Communist Party members and the people of North China feel even more affectionate and excited about this festival. In the great struggle to win the birth of a new China, the army and people of North China, like the army and people of the whole country, paid a great price. For nearly thirteen years, they have fought bravely against Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary groups supported by American imperialism, and achieved the final victory. Countless martyrs shed their last drop of blood. They deeply know the difficulty of creating a new China and feel its greatness and loveliness.
　　The Party organizations and the army and people of North China have been tempered by long-term revolutionary struggles and have political awareness. They have not only bravely defeated the fierce enemy, but also bravely started large-scale economic recovery and construction work. Under the direct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee and the Central People's Government, and with the joint efforts of the entire Party, army, and people in North China, we have basically completed the main tasks of 1950.
　　(1) After a series of work such as inventorying, adjusting wages, democratizing management, enterprise, safety inspection, production competition, and rationalization proposal movements in the state-owned factories and mines in North China, the workers have regarded themselves as the true masters of production and greatly exerted their production enthusiasm and creativity. Both output and quality have been significantly improved. Many factories and mines have exceeded the pre-liberation production level. Some factories in Tianjin have even exceeded it by one to two times. Other achievements have been made in reducing accidents, reducing consumption, and reducing costs. This is of great significance for restoring industrial production. Under the direct leadership of the Central Government, prices were stabilized in March and April this year. From June to July, the industry and commerce of North China were adjusted by means of processing, ordering, loans, adjusting business scope, organizing joint operations, labor-capital consultation, and relief for unemployed workers, so that the industry and commerce of North China began to move towards planned production, normalized industrial and commercial relations and public-private relations, and achieved considerable development.
　　(2) Except for areas severely damaged by the enemy, disaster areas, and particularly barren mountainous areas, agricultural production in the old areas has generally reached the pre-war level, and a few counties have exceeded the pre-war level, while the new areas are close to the pre-war level. This year, North China has an average of about 80% harvest, and the total output has reached 91.3% of the pre-war level, completing the task of increasing grain production by 2.5 billion jin. This year, a total of 21.41 million mu of cotton were planted. At 28 jin of lint cotton per mu, it can produce more than 6 million dan of lint cotton, reaching the pre-war production level, an increase of more than 1 million dan compared with last year. More than 20 million mu of new paddy fields have also been built, exceeding the plan. Other achievements have been made in increasing the planting of peanuts, hemp, and other cash crops, overcoming the difficulties of labor, livestock, and agricultural implements, and improving farming techniques. It is estimated that it is entirely possible to fully restore the pre-war production level next year. The above achievements have been achieved because, in addition to abundant rainfall and timely cultivation, the following key links in agricultural production have been grasped: First, adhering to the direction of organizing to restore and develop agricultural and sideline production, and overcoming the utopian idea of agricultural socialism. Second, extensively carrying out production mutual aid movements combined with improving technology such as seed selection and the use of new agricultural implements, overcoming and overcoming the difficulties of labor and livestock, ensuring timely sowing and certain improvements in cultivation technology. In the old areas, if organization is not combined with improving technology, mutual aid groups will not be able to move forward. Third, implementing the policy of self-reliance in production, and the mass and sustained struggle against disasters has played a great role in preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests. Fourth, with the assistance of national trade agencies and cooperatives, a correct price policy has been adhered to, in which the contract system plays a huge role.
　　The rural areas in the old liberated areas have been "middle-peasantized," and people's lives have been considerably improved. The peasants who used to have "bran and vegetables for half a year" no longer eat bran, and the peasants who used to be vegetarians all year round now also eat some meat. Some people have even begun to have savings. According to a survey of 1,179 households in six villages in Wuxiang, Shanxi, middle peasants account for about 85% of the total number of households, population, land, livestock, sheep flocks, and grain production in rural areas. The labor, livestock, and other production conditions used on the land in these six villages have also been considerably restored. Labor has increased in the past two years (supplemented by demobilized and transferred labor reserves), and coupled with the abolition of war service, organization, and mobilizing women to participate in production, labor is no longer a problem, and some households even have a surplus. Before the war, these six villages had a total of 325 livestock. After being destroyed by the enemy, the loss reached two-thirds. By 1949, it had reached 386, and this year it increased by another 10, exceeding the pre-war level. At the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, there was no surplus grain in the entire village. Now, those with more than 10 shi of grain account for 3.14% of households, those with more than 5 shi of grain account for 6.7% of households, those with more than 1 shi of grain account for 33.46% of households, those who have enough to eat account for 47.2% of households, and those who are poor and do not have enough to eat due to weddings, funerals, and illnesses account for 6.5% of households. According to the county party committee's estimate, 25% of households in the county have surplus grain, 65% of households have a small surplus or enough to eat, and about 10% of households have difficulties (families of martyrs, soldiers, cadres, and orphans, widows, elderly, weak, and loafers), which is roughly the same as the situation in these six villages. The increasing popularity of building houses, and the houses and buildings destroyed by Japanese invaders and Kuomintang bandits and special agents have been largely restored. Cloth, waterwheels, agricultural implements, and chemical fertilizers have become necessities for farmers' production and life. Some wealthy farmers demand daily necessities such as Sunlight soap, towels, glass, mirrors, and foreign combs, and their living standards have begun to improve. Due to the changes in class relations in rural areas and the restoration and development of the economy, a series of new problems have emerged in the rural areas of the old liberated areas, that is, how to find sales channels for agricultural products and sideline products from developed rural production, how to overcome the danger of negativity and disintegration of mutual aid groups due to the solution of difficulties in life and production, how to find a way out for surplus labor, and how to help some farmers solve their difficulties in life and production to prevent poverty and bankruptcy that can be avoided. These problems have been raised to us and must be systematically solved.
　　(3) In the past year, the trade operated by state-owned, private, and cooperative enterprises has greatly developed, and the new democratic trade relations are replacing the destroyed feudal and semi-colonial trade relations. In the past year, farmers in North China have supplied urban residents, workers, and factories with a large number of industrial raw materials and food. According to statistics, from September last year to September this year, about 2.54 billion jin of coarse and fine grains and 150 million jin of cotton have been supplied to cities. The supply of industrial products from cities to rural areas has also greatly increased. From September last year to June this year, the total value of department stores going to the countryside in various cities in North China reached 208 billion yuan, not including those flowing in from Shanghai and Qingdao later. Cooperatives have become the largest mass organization in North China. As of March this year, there were a total of 6.16 million members in the region, 1,026 urban consumer cooperatives, and more than 12,000 rural supply and marketing cooperatives, with a capital of 300 million jin of millet, and the trade volume accounted for 14% of the total trade volume of the people of North China. The contract system has been widely promoted through supply and marketing cooperatives, making it an important link in organizing mass production, connecting trade between urban and rural areas and regions, and enriching cooperative business. At present, the development of trade work is a central link in the process of economic recovery and development in North China. The most urgent problem today is to sell farmers' large amount of grain, cotton, peanuts, vegetable oil, and agricultural and sideline products such as fur, bristles, eggs, pork, casings, straw braid, bamboo ware, iron ware, ceramics, and a large number of mountain goods, and exchange them for daily necessities such as kerosene, cloth, waterwheels, agricultural implements, chemical fertilizers, and other living materials needed by farmers. If this cannot be done, rural production will be hindered, farmers' purchasing power will be greatly reduced, and urban industry and commerce will be depressed and stagnant. Therefore, vigorously developing commerce operated by state-owned, private, and cooperative enterprises has become a central link in the current economic construction work.
　　(4) In accordance with the instructions of Chairman Mao and the central government, all cities, counties, and districts have convened people's representative conferences of all circles more than once. Most rural areas have held such conferences. People's representative conferences of all circles in various provinces, cities, and cities directly under the province have mostly been held, and some are being prepared. The convening of people's representative conferences of all circles has a great role in further strengthening the ties between the Party, the government, and the people, as well as promoting various tasks. However, it must be pointed out that some places still do not pay enough attention to this, and the remnants of closed-doorism still exist. We must seriously overcome this and ensure that the representatives can speak freely and feel in practice that criticism and suggestions can achieve practical results.
　　(5) In accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions and the provisions of the Common Program, in dealing with special agents and counter-revolutionaries, generally speaking, we have implemented a policy of combining suppression and leniency. On the one hand, we have given a large number of redeemable counter-revolutionaries the opportunity to study and reform through labor, and assigned them appropriate jobs after study and reform. On the other hand, we have also suppressed counter-revolutionary activities. Most of North China is an old liberated area, and the people with awareness and organization have sharp eyes for special agents and counter-revolutionaries. Throughout the year, a total of 157 major cases have been solved and 410 important special agents have been captured in the entire region. However, there are still many weaknesses in the struggle against counter-revolutionary activities, especially because some of our comrades have adopted a corrupt and laissez-faire attitude towards this issue, so that they do not pay attention to the people's demands at all and only show leniency, which the people have concluded as "unlimited leniency." This dangerous tendency must be resolutely overcome in order to completely eliminate counter-revolutionary activities.
　　It should be said that the achievements in the past year are the main ones, but there are still many and great shortcomings and difficulties. The main ones are: (1) The tasks are very heavy and the problems are becoming more and more complicated, but the improvement of our cadres' political, policy, and technical levels cannot keep up with the objective needs, so that many shortcomings and errors have occurred in actual work. (2) Bureaucracy and commandism still exist widely, which hinders the close ties between the Party, the government, and the masses, which must be resolved in the Party rectification and cadre rectification. (3) Various disasters have occurred continuously and are still very serious, causing great damage to agricultural production. (4) Special agents, bandits, and a small number of landlords and rich peasants use every gap in our work to carry out sabotage activities. In particular, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit group is still directing the open and hidden special agents and bandits on the mainland from Taiwan, sneaking into our Party, government, and army to hide and wait for opportunities to carry out sabotage. Therefore, there should be no complacency or negligence at all, but we should move forward cautiously and steadily on the basis of the existing work and prepare to eliminate all enemies. In order to complete this task, we must resolutely implement the tasks put forward by Chairman Mao at the Third Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee and do the following specific work:
　　(1) Continue to adjust industry and commerce. Not only should the industry and commerce of large cities be seriously adjusted, but also the industry and commerce of small and medium-sized cities. In addition to implementing the central government's various regulations on adjusting industry and commerce, reasonable and feasible parity prices for agricultural and industrial products should be stipulated at present, and measures such as state procurement, cooperative organization of material exchanges, and mobilizing and organizing private merchants to go to the countryside to purchase agricultural products should be taken to improve the current serious scissors gap between industrial and agricultural products that seriously threatens farmers. Continue to restore and develop public and private industries, improve and enhance the leadership of industrial production, implement democratic management, strengthen planning, strictly implement the economic accounting system, improve production technology, completely eliminate accidents, and determine production according to sales, in order to achieve the goal of high quality, low cost, and wide sales. The main force of the Party committees at all levels in North China should guide the state-owned, cooperative-operated, and privately-operated commerce, and try their best to find outlets for farmers' products. Comrades should be called upon to learn commerce. County, prefectural, and provincial party committees should systematically convene local special product and native product conferences to organize the sales of native products nationwide and organize native product exports, so as to find outlets for the special and native products of their counties, prefectures, and provinces. This is the best way to serve the people.
　　(2) Continue to restore and develop agricultural production, carry out winter sideline production in a planned way, and carry out a winter manure accumulation movement. The plan for the year lies in winter. We must do a good job in preparing for spring plowing next year this winter and strive for the entire region to fully reach the pre-war agricultural production level in 1951, and the old areas to exceed the pre-war production level. In addition to increasing grain production, special attention should be paid to increasing the production of cotton, hemp, flaxseed, peanuts, and other cash crops. To this end, it is necessary to plan ahead to repair the main rivers that are prone to breaches and overflows every year, and consider plans to fundamentally manage the Yellow River, Ziya River, Daqing River, and Yongding River, open up canals widely, turn water disasters into water conservancy, dig wells in large quantities, promote waterwheels, create water conservancy cooperatives, and fully combat drought. Advocate seed selection, seed soaking, seed mixing, and seed exchange, promote improved varieties, universally cultivate autumn land once, dig insect nests, burn grass roots, and prepare a large number of scientific medicines and machinery for killing insects to reduce diseases and insect pests. Increase fertilizer, increase livestock, and cultivate deeply and carefully. Promote new agricultural implements with emphasis. All guiding cadres in rural work should learn and promote agricultural technology, send agricultural technicians to the countryside, and teach farmers how to use and repair new agricultural implements, use medicines, and other agricultural technologies. Further strengthen organization, and develop civil credit undertakings through cooperatives, do a good job in agricultural loans, so as to solve the unsolvable difficulties in the lives and production of some farmers and prevent poverty and bankruptcy.
　　(3) Cooperatives in North China have become the most extensive mass economic organizations and an important part of the people's economy. Party committees at all levels must put cooperative work on the party's regular agenda, study and discuss it from a policy and business perspective, arrange, inspect, and summarize it regularly, and mobilize all party members to lead cooperative work with the spirit of leading land reform. Some places in North China have done a better job in cooperative work. The main experience is to grasp the three basic links of production, sales, and supply. Through supply and marketing cooperatives, the contract system is universally promoted, communication between urban and rural areas and regions is facilitated, farmers' surplus products are sold, industrial products needed by farmers are supplied, and merchants' intermediate exploitation is reduced. At the same time, new cooperatives should be established and old cooperatives transformed in a planned and step-by-step manner, and the allocation and training of cooperative cadres should be strengthened, and the internal democratic system of cooperatives should be improved, so that the democratic system of cooperatives and the responsibility system in business are well combined.
　　(4) People's representative conferences at all levels must continue to be convened regularly and periodically. It is the most powerful weapon for implementing various policies and overcoming bureaucracy and commandism. It is the main organizational form for embodying the people's democratic united front. It must continue to be enriched and improved to make it a democratic habit in the lives of the broad masses of people; and it should be combined with the current rectification campaign to check and summarize work, and further consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front. Some counties in the old liberated areas should start convening people's congresses, and promote them to the entire region after gaining experience.
　　(5) More efforts than in any previous year should be used to carry out cultural and educational work. Further popularize national education, increase the enrollment ratio of school-age children, train and improve teachers, improve teaching methods, and appropriately add some schools according to possible conditions. Establish a large number of spare-time cultural schools for workers and government agencies, and strengthen the leadership of these schools. Further run the worker-peasant rapid middle schools well, and try to run worker-peasant rapid primary schools to effectively improve the cultural level of worker-peasant cadres and soldiers to meet the urgent needs of national economic construction and national defense construction. Encourage and help literary and art workers create more literary and art works, and carry out mass cultural activities in a step-by-step manner. Seize the winter school work this winter, focusing on literacy education, and in conjunction with production and democratic education. We should continue to train old intellectuals and old public and educational personnel and transform them to serve the people. It should be pointed out here that the North China People's Revolutionary University and the People's Public Schools in various provinces have achieved results in educating and transforming old intellectuals and should continue to run them.
　　(6) Smash rumors, eliminate bandits and special agents, suppress all counter-revolutionary activities, ban secret societies and Taoist sects, strengthen the people's anti-espionage and confidentiality work, consolidate revolutionary order, and protect economic construction. To this end, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the military region, rectify the militia, strengthen the work of public security organs and the people's police. Any paralysis or negligence will suffer serious losses.
　　(7) Resolutely complete the task of Party rectification and cadre rectification in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, which is the key to correctly completing the above tasks. The entire North China region will complete the rectification of leading organs above the county level in mid-October, and then, this winter and next spring, in conjunction with the current work, conduct the rectification of district and village cadres and Party members in order to systematically overcome bureaucratic and commandist styles, further strengthen the ties between the Party, the government, and the masses, and better complete the construction tasks. The key lies in seriously examining work, solving basic problems, and improving everyone's awareness with a thorough attitude of criticism and self-criticism.
　　On the occasion of celebrating the first National Day of the People's Republic of China, we call on all Party members and all people in North China to carry forward the spirit of heroic struggle in the past several decades, especially in the past ten years, and to work hard a hundred times, "guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and be cautious and humble," in order to complete the glorious tasks given to us by the Party and the Central People's Government to welcome the second National Day.

　　继续调整工商业，提高农业生产，学会贸易工作。
    薄一波
    今天是中华人民共和国的第一个国庆日，全国军民都在热烈庆祝。华北的共产党员和华北的军民，对此节日感到更为亲切和兴奋。在争取新中国诞生的伟大斗争中，华北军民与全国军民同样付出过极大的代价，近十三年来，与日本帝国主义和美国帝国主义扶持下的国民党反动集团进行了英勇的战斗，并取得了最后胜利，无数先烈流尽了自己的最后一滴血。他们深知新中国缔造之艰难，格外感到它的伟大和可爱。
    华北的党的组织和华北的军民是经过长期革命斗争的锻炼和有政治觉悟的，既已勇敢地战胜了凶暴的敌人，又勇敢地开始了大规模的恢复和发展经济的建设工作。一年来在毛主席、党中央和中央人民政府的直接领导下，在华北全党全军和全体人民的共同努力下，我们已基本上完成了一九五○年的各项主要任务。
    （一）华北的国营厂矿经过清点、调整工资、管理民主化、企业化、安全检查、生产竞赛、合理化建议运动等一系列的工作后，职工把自己当成了生产的真正主人，大大发挥了生产的积极性和创造性，产量和质量均有显著提高，不少厂矿已超过解放前的生产水平，天津有些工厂甚至超过一倍到两倍。其他在减少事故、减少耗损和降低成本等方面亦获有成绩。这对于恢复工业生产是有重要意义的。在中央直接领导下，今年三、四月间平稳了物价，六、七月间以加工、订货、贷款、调整经营范围、组织联营、劳资协商和救济失业工人等措施，调整了华北的工商业，使华北工商业开始走向有计划的生产，使工商关系和公私关系正常化，并获得了相当发展。
    （二）农业生产除遭敌人严重破坏过的地区、灾区和特别硗瘠的山地外，老区一般已达战前水平，少数县并超过战前水平，新区接近战前水平。今年华北平均约有八成年景，总产量已达战前水平的百分之九十一点三，完成了增产二十五亿斤粮食的任务。今年共植棉二、一四一万亩，每亩以二十八斤皮棉计，可产皮棉六百多万担，已达战前生产水平，比去年增产一百多万担。新修水田二千余万亩，亦超过计划。其他如增植花生、麻及其他经济作物，克服劳畜力农具困难和改良耕作技术等方面，均有不少成绩。估计明年完全恢复到战前生产水平，是完全可能的。上述成绩之所以获得，除因雨水充沛，耕作及时外，还由于掌握了农业生产上的几个重要环节：第一、坚持组织起来恢复和发展农业生产和副业生产的方向，克服了空想的农业社会主义思想。第二、广泛地开展了与提高技术如选种、使用新式农具等相结合的生产互助运动，克服了并克服着劳畜力的困难，保证了及时下种和耕作技术的某些提高，在老区组织起来如果不与提高技术等相结合，互助组就将不能前进。第三、贯彻了生产自救的方针，群众性的持久的抗灾斗争，对防治病虫害起了很大作用。第四、在国家贸易机关和合作社的协助下，坚持了正确的价格政策，在此，合同制起着巨大作用。
    老区农村已“中农化”了，人民生活已有相当改善，过去“糠菜半年粮”的农民，现在不吃糠了，过去通年素食的农民，现在也吃点肉了，部分群众并已开始有了积蓄。据山西武乡六村一一七九户调查，中农无论户数、人口、土地、牲畜、羊群、产粮，均达农村总数的百分之八十五左右。该六村使用在土地上的劳畜力和其他生产条件，亦均有相当恢复，劳力在近二年来已有增加（复员转业劳力后备补充），加上取消战争勤务，组织起来，发动妇女参加生产等，劳力已不再困难，若干户并有剩余。该六村战前共有牲畜三百二十五头，经过敌人的摧毁，损失达三分之二，至一九四九年已达三百八十六头，今年又增加十头，已超过战前。该六村在抗战末期和解放战争中，全村均无余粮，现在，存粮十石以上者占百分之三点一四户，存粮五石以上者占百分之六点七户，存粮一石以上者占百分之三三点四六户，够吃用者占百分之四七点二户，由于婚丧疾病而致贫穷不够吃用者占百分之六点五户。另据该县县委估计，全县有余粮者占百分之二五户，少有余粮或够吃用者占百分之六五户，有困难者（烈、军、干属和孤、寡、老、弱、二流子等）约占百分之十户，与此六村情形大体相同。修建房屋的日渐普遍增多，被日寇和国民党匪特破坏的房舍屋宇已大部恢复，一进入农村就会感到新气象。布匹、水车、农具、化学肥料等已成为农民生产和生活的必需品。部分富裕农民则要求日光皂、毛巾、玻璃、照面镜、洋梳子等日用必需品，其生活程度已开始提高。由于农村阶级关系的变动及经济的恢复和发展，老区农村已发生一系列的新问题，即如何替发展了的农村生产的农产品和副产品找销路，如何克服互助组因生活和生产中的困难已经解决而发生的消极与散伙的危险，如何替剩余劳力找出路，如何帮助某一部分农民解决其生活与生产中的困难，以防止可能避免的贫穷和破产等，这些问题已提在我们面前，必须系统地加以解决。
    （三）一年来公营、私营和合作社经营的贸易，均有很大发展，新民主主义的贸易关系，正在代替已被破坏了的封建的半殖民地的贸易关系。一年来华北农民供应了城市居民、工人和工厂大批工业原料和粮食，据统计，自去年九月到今年九月，共供给城市粗细粮食约二十五亿四千余万斤，供给棉花一亿五千余万斤。城市供应农村的工业品也大为增加，从去年九月到今年六月，华北各城市百货下乡总值达二○八○亿元，其后上海、青岛流入者未计算在内。合作社已成为华北最大的群众组织，截至今年三月止，全区共有社员六百一十六万人，城市消费合作社有一千零二十六个，乡村供销合作社有一万二千多个，资金达三亿斤小米，贸易额占华北人民贸易总额的百分之十四。经过供销合作社普遍地推行了合同制，使之成为组织群众生产、沟通城乡和地区间的贸易并充实合作社业务的重要环节。目前华北在恢复和发展经济过程中，贸易工作的开展是一个中心环节，今天最迫切的问题，就是把农民为数很大的粮食、棉花、花生、植物油和农副产品如皮毛、猪鬃、鸡蛋、猪肉、肠衣、草帽辫、竹器、铁器、陶瓷器等和大批山货推销出去，并给农民换回他们所需要的日用必需品如煤油、布匹、水车、农具、化学肥料及其他生活资料，如果这一点办不到，农村生产就会被阻滞，农民购买力就会大大降低，因而城市工商业也就会消沉迟滞起来。因此，大力开展公营、私营和合作社经营的商业，成为目前经建工作中的一个中心环节。
    （四）遵照毛主席和中央的指示，所有市、县、区都不止一次地召开了各界人民代表会议，绝大部分农村都开过了这种会，各省、市和省直属市的各界人民代表会议大部已开过，有的正筹备召开。各界人民代表会议的召开，对于进一步密切党、政府和人民的联系以及各种工作的推动上，均有极大的作用。但必须指出，某些地方对此重视仍然不够，关门主义的残余仍然存在，必须认真加以克服，必须做到使代表们畅所欲言，并在实际中感到批评和建议均能收到实效。
    （五）遵照毛主席指示和共同纲领的规定，对待特务和反革命分子，从总的方面说来，我们是执行了镇压与宽大相结合的政策的，一方面对大批可以挽救的反革命分子，给以学习和劳动改造的机会，并在学习和改造后分配以适当的工作。另一方面也镇压了反革命的活动。华北大多是老区，有觉悟有组织的人民对于特务和反革命分子的眼睛是亮的。全年全区一共破获过重要案件一五七起，捕获过重要特务分子四一○人。但是对反革命活动的斗争还有很多弱点，特别是由于我们某些同志对于这个问题采取腐败的放任态度，以致对人民要求极不重视，一味以宽大为怀，人民给他们作了结论，叫做“宽大无边”。这种危险倾向必须坚决克服，以便彻底消灭反革命活动。
    一年来应该说成绩是主要的，但缺点和困难仍然很多很大，举其要者：（１）任务很繁重，问题越来越复杂，但我们干部的政治上、政策上和技术上的水平的提高却赶不上客观需要，以致在实际工作中曾产生了不少的缺点和错误。（２）官僚主义、命令主义尚普遍存在，它妨害了党、政府与群众的密切联系，这须在整党整干中加以解决。（３）各种灾害连续发生，至今仍很严重，对农业生产破坏极大。（４）特务土匪和少数地主富农，他们利用我们工作中的每一空隙进行破坏活动。特别蒋匪集团仍在台湾指挥大陆上公开的和暗藏的特务土匪，潜入我党、政和军队内隐蔽待机，进行破坏。因此，绝不应有丝毫的骄傲自满，麻痹疏忽，而要在现有工作基础上，谨慎稳步地前进，并准备消灭一切敌人。为完成此任务，必须坚决执行毛主席在中共中央三中全会上所提出的任务，做好以下具体工作：
    （一）继续调整工商业，不仅对大城市而且同样对中小城市的工商业也应该认真加以调整，除贯彻中央调整工商业的各项规定外，目前应规定合理的可以行得通的农工业产品的比价，采取国家收购、合作社组织物资交流并动员组织私商下乡收购农产品等办法，以改善目前严重威胁农民的工农业产品的剪刀差额。继续恢复和发展公私工业，改善和提高对工业生产的领导，贯彻管理民主化，加强计划性，严格经济核算制，提高生产技术，彻底消灭事故，并按销定产，以此达到质量高，成本低，销路广之目的。华北各级党委的主要力量，应指导国营的合作社经营的和私人经营的商业，尽量给农民产品找到出路，应号召同志们学会商业，县、地、省委均应有计划地有系统地召开各地的特产土产会议，在全国范围内去组织土产的推销工作并组织土产出口，为本县本专区本省的特产土产找到销路，这样就是最好地为人民服了务。
    （二）继续恢复和发展农业生产，有计划地开展冬季副业生产，冬季积肥运动，一年之计在于冬，必须于今冬作好明年春耕准备工作，争取全区于一九五一年完全达到战前农业生产水平，老区超过战前生产水平。除增产粮食外，应特别注意提高棉花、麻、大麻子、花生和其他经济作物的生产。为此，必须有计划地提早修治每年易于决口漫溢的几条主要河流，并考虑对黄河、子牙河、大清河、永定河作治本的计划，广开渠道，变水患为水利；大量凿井，推广水车，创建水利合作社，改善农田灌溉，全力战胜旱灾。提倡选种、浸种、拌种、换种，推广优良品种，秋地普耕一遍，挖虫窝，烧草根，并大量准备杀虫的科学药械，减免病虫害。增加肥料，增殖牲畜，深耕细作。有重点地推行新式农具，所有农村工作的指导干部，均应学习和提倡农业技术，派遣农业技术人员下乡，教会农民使用和修理新式农具、运用药剂及其他农业技术。进一步加强组织起来，并经过合作社开展民间信贷事业，搞好农贷，以解决一部分农民在生活和生产中不可解决的困难，防止贫穷破产。
    （三）华北的合作社已成为最广泛的群众经济组织和人民经济中的重要组成部分，各级党委必须把合作社工作放在党的经常的议事日程上，从政策上业务上加以研究讨论，定期布置、检查和总结，动员全体党员以领导土改的精神来领导合作社工作。华北有些地方合作社工作做得较好，主要经验是抓紧了产、销、供三个基本环节。经过供销合作社，普遍推广合同制，沟通城乡和地区间的物资交流，推销农民的剩余产品，供给农民所需要的工业用品，减免商人的中间剥削。同时，应有重点地有步骤地建立新社，改造旧社，并加强合作社干部的配备与训练，健全合作社内部的民主制度，把合作社的民主制度和业务上的责任制，很好地结合起来。
    （四）必须继续经常地定期地召开各级人民代表会议，它是贯彻各项政策，克服官僚主义、命令主义最有力的武器，是体现人民民主统一战线的主要组织形式，必须继续充实和健全它，务使其成为广大人民的民主生活习惯；并应与当前整风相结合，检查总结工作，进一步巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线。老区某些县应着手召开人民代表大会，俟取得经验后推广到全区去。
    （五）要用较以往任何一年为多的力量，开展文化教育工作。进一步普及国民教育，增加学龄儿童的入学比例，培养和提高师资，改善教学方法，并根据可能条件适当地增设一些学校。大量建立职工的和机关的业余文化学校，加强对这些学校的领导。进一步办好工农速成中学，试办工农速成小学，有效地提高工农干部和战士的文化水平，以应国家经济建设和国防建设的亟需。鼓励并帮助文学、美术工作者创作更多的文学美术作品，有步骤地开展群众性的文化活动。抓紧今冬冬学工作，以识字教育为主，并配合以生产和民主教育。应继续训练旧知识分子和旧公教人员，改造他们为人民服务，这里应指出华北人民革命大学和各省人民公学在教育和改造旧知识分子上是有成绩的，应继续办下去。
    （六）粉碎谣言，扑灭匪特，镇压一切反革命分子的活动，取缔会门道门，加强人民的防奸保密工作，巩固革命秩序，保卫经济建设。为此，必须加强军区领导，整顿民兵加强公安机关和人民警察的工作，任何麻痹疏忽，都将遭受严重的损失。
    （七）遵照毛主席的指示坚决完成整党整干任务，这是正确地完成上述各项任务的关键。华北全区，将于十月中旬完成县以上领导机关的整风后，于今冬明春，配合当前工作，进行对区村干部和党员的整风，以便系统地克服官僚主义和命令主义作风，进一步密切党、政府与群众的联系，更好地完成建设任务。其关键就在于以彻底的批评与自我批评的态度，认真检查工作，解决基本问题，提高大家觉悟。
    值此庆祝人民共和国第一个国庆日的时候，我们号召华北全体党员和全体人民，要发扬数十年来特别是近十余年来的英勇奋斗的精神，百倍奋发，“戒骄戒躁，谨慎谦虚”，以完成党和中央人民政府给予我们的光荣任务，来迎接第二个国庆日。
