Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th - Comprehensive report from TASS, Moscow: The Second All-Soviet Conference in Defense of Peace concluded on the 18th. Before its closing, the conference continued its discussion of Tikhonov's report.

The Acting Chairman of the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee, Kozhimasov, said: Soviet youth vehemently denounce the American imperialists' aggression against Korea and warmly wish the Korean people's liberation struggle victory. Soviet youth strive for peace not out of fear of war, but to dedicate their lives to peaceful and creative labor. In just one year, seventy foreign youth delegations have visited the Soviet Union. Soviet youth call on all youth around the world, regardless of race, political affiliation, or religious belief, to resolutely fight for peace and the happiness of all people around the world.

The Chief Engineer of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station Construction, Malyshev, pointed out: The several great water conservancy projects being built by the Soviet Union are used to defend peace and the people's happiness. The Soviet Union is vigorously transforming and utilizing nature to strengthen the cause of peace.

Female student Chekucheva said: Soviet students do not want war. We are the happiest generation. We want to grasp science with all our enthusiasm according to Comrade Stalin's call. Science in our hands is a powerful tool for striving for peace and progress. Students all over the world should step up their unity under the banner of peace.

The Supreme Patriarch of All Armenians, George VI, said: The Soviet people have never thought of despising and enslaving other countries. Great humanitarianism and love for the people are the characteristics of the noble soul of the Russian people. Therefore, people all over the world love us, and any rumors and slanders by foreign reactionaries will not extinguish this flame of love.

The leader of the Muslims of Transcaucasia, Ali-Zade, on behalf of the Muslims of Transcaucasia, Central Asia, and Kazakhstan, congratulated the conference and appealed to Muslims in the Near East and the Middle East to actively participate in the struggle for peace and oppose the American imperialists' aggression against Korea.

Ukrainian writer Gonchar said: We demand that the bourgeois governments of all countries immediately stop persecuting peace advocates. Peace fighters are the best sons and daughters of the people, and they have the right to enjoy full freedom.

Famous writer and journalist Polevoy urged progressive journalists in all countries to dedicate all their enthusiasm, strength, and talent to the cause of defending peace.

Doctor of Biology Pokrovskaya angrily exposed the heinous conspiracy of bourgeois scientists who are preparing for bacteriological warfare. She said: Soviet scientists vow to fight for the life of mankind, to fight against disease and aging, to fight to stop drought and eliminate deserts, and to fight to stop war.

Retired honorary soldier, Soviet hero Colonel Kerbas said: A person who has participated in the Great Patriotic War feels particularly close to the people's lofty desire for peace. I have seen prosperous cities turned into ruins, and I will never forget Hitler's Maidaneck death camp. The wounds of war are still fresh in my memory, but the American and British imperialists are already preparing to throw humanity into a new slaughterhouse. But our comrades-in-arms are engaged in the construction of the motherland, carrying out the glorious task of defending peace, which is why the people of the world look to the Soviet Union with hope and confidence.

The conference concluded its discussion at this point and elected a 65-member delegation to attend the Second World Congress of Defenders of Peace. This included Tikhonov, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Defense Committee, writers Ehrenburg and Vasilevskaya, famous journalist Zaslavsky, composer Shostakovich, steelworker Zhuravlev, famous tractor driver Angelina, and Archbishop Nikolai, among others.

The delegates to the conference unanimously passed a mandate to the Soviet delegates attending the Second World Congress in Defense of Peace. The mandate stated:

	“The imperialists are further expanding and implementing their plans to dominate the world. Peace advocates from all countries must expand and strengthen the world movement to defend peace, closely unite their ranks, and continue to strive for more people to fight for peace.

    苏联青年反法西斯委员会代理主席科齐马索夫说：苏联青年痛斥美帝国主义者侵略朝鲜，热烈祝望朝鲜人民解放斗争的胜利。苏联青年争取和平，并不是害怕战争，而是要把生命贡献给和平的创造性劳动。仅在一年之内，就有七十个外国青年代表团访问了苏联。苏联青年号召全世界青年不分种族、政治及宗教信仰，坚决为和平与全世界人民的幸福而斗争。
    古比雪夫水力发电站建筑总工程师马利塞夫指出：苏联兴建的几个伟大的水利工程，是用来保卫和平与人民的幸福的。苏联为了加强和平事业正在大力改造自然，利用自然。

    退休的荣誉军人、苏联英雄克尔巴斯上校说：一个参加过伟大的卫国战争的人，对于人民争取和平的崇高愿望特别感到亲切。我看过繁荣的城市变成废墟，我永远不会忘记希特勒的麦丹尼克死亡营。战争的创伤记忆犹新，而美英帝国主义者却已准备将人类投入新的屠场了。但我们的战友们正从事祖国的建设工作，执行着光荣的保卫和平的任务，这就是世界人民满怀希望与信心注视着苏联的原因。
