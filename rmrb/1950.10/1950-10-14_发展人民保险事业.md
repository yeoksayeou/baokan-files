　　Developing the People's Insurance Industry

　　The people's insurance industry is still a new undertaking in China. It plays an important role in national economic construction, because it can prevent and compensate for economic losses caused to the people and the country by various disasters. In the event of a disaster, it can provide affected enterprises with the funds to recover, preventing them from being forced to shut down due to lack of funds, or increasing the state's unexpected financial burden. At the same time, insurance can be used to develop people's savings, pool funds, and help restore and develop national production and construction.

　　Before the Anti-Japanese War, China's insurance industry, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, basically served imperialism and developed alongside imperialist economic aggression. Therefore, this industry was marked by extreme compradorism and plunder from the beginning. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the annual national insurance premium income was about 50 million yuan, of which foreign companies accounted for more than 40 million yuan. Statistics from 1937 show that about 2.35 million pounds of insurance premiums flowed abroad each year, accounting for 75% of the national insurance premium income. At that time, Chinese companies were merely agents of foreign companies. During the Anti-Japanese War, in occupied China, the insurance market was completely controlled by the Japanese invaders. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the four major families monopolized the insurance industry, and the private insurance industry, which had a relatively good foundation, was also completely reduced to an appendage of the bureaucrat capital-controlled insurance industry. The insurance industry at that time, like other financial industries, mainly engaged in speculation. A false prosperity once appeared in the insurance market, with the number of Chinese companies reaching as many as 369 at one point. These insurance businesses not only did not support national industry and commerce, but also seriously damaged them. After liberation, this situation in the insurance market was fundamentally changed.

　　In the past year, the construction of the people's insurance industry has made considerable achievements. On the basis of taking over the corrupt insurance institutions of bureaucrat-comprador capital, the unified national People's Insurance Company of China was quickly established. Among the eighteen types of businesses currently operated, the main ones are property fire insurance and water and land transportation insurance for goods. Transportation insurance includes insurance for transportation vehicles, war risk insurance for transported goods, and robbery insurance. It has played an increasing guiding role in protecting state property, connecting urban and rural goods, and stimulating import and export trade, allowing some enterprises to boldly and freely operate their businesses. In terms of insurance methods, the People's Insurance Company has focused on conducting disaster prevention inspections for various production enterprise units and actively put forward suggestions for improving disaster prevention equipment. This has completely changed the old tradition of simply providing compensation after the fact and reduced accidental disasters in production enterprises. It is particularly worth pointing out that the people's insurance industry has begun to pay attention to serving the vast rural areas and has gained some experience. Although this agricultural insurance is limited to draught animals and cotton harvest insurance, and is currently only being piloted in a few areas due to objective conditions, it has been welcomed by farmers and supported by society. This is one of the main directions for the future development of the new China's people's insurance industry. In addition, various types of personal insurance, although conditions are not yet ripe and it is not possible to promote them quickly and universally, will be a very popular business with broad development prospects and a good way for people to save long-term after the country's financial and economic situation improves substantially and people's living standards rise generally. The disease allowance, maternity, marriage, and funeral loan methods being piloted in East China meet the requirements of the broad working people and can be expanded and piloted in various places in conjunction with the implementation of labor insurance.

　　Based on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union's insurance work, China's people's insurance industry should transition from voluntary insurance to compulsory insurance for the main wealth of the country and the people. In this way, the main wealth of the country and the people can be effectively guaranteed through the insurance industry. Because the implementation of compulsory insurance can organize sufficient economic strength to prevent and salvage losses caused by accidental events in production enterprises on a large scale. It can also organize a large amount of economic strength to focus on supporting major production undertakings, so that economically strong regions can support economically weak regions or regions that need to be developed. Through universal compulsory insurance, it is possible to more accurately understand the national economic situation and production capacity, which is conducive to the national economic construction gradually moving from a decentralized, anarchic state to a path of planned production.

　　Compulsory insurance can be implemented first for state-owned enterprises and state organs, followed by various types of passenger accident insurance, as these businesses are relatively easy to enforce. Compulsory insurance for cooperatives can start from the general cooperatives above the county level and then develop to the grassroots cooperatives. In terms of implementation steps, we can currently conduct extensive publicity, prepare to formulate laws and regulations, strengthen investigation work, adjust institutions, and prepare cadres, starting with state-owned enterprises. If it is not possible to implement compulsory insurance immediately and comprehensively, it can also be piloted locally, but compulsory insurance must be supported by the people, otherwise it will not work with laws alone.

　　For insurance work for private enterprises, in addition to fire insurance and other insurance that should be obtained as early as possible, the focus should be on transportation insurance. Since the proportion of private trade is still very large, in order to better leverage the enthusiasm of urban and rural capital to benefit the restoration and development of the national economy, insurance work should establish extensive ties with private enterprises and set out a certain plan as a goal to strive for. Private enterprises in major cities should be understood and strive to have them insured as much as possible.

　　In order to reduce the burden on the insured and reduce production costs, and at the same time enable the broad masses of people to have the opportunity to enjoy insurance rights, a low premium rate policy should be implemented. In principle, industry, especially heavy industry, and production undertakings that are the focus of development should be taken care of. Small cities and backward areas, areas with low affordability or newly opened insurance businesses should also be taken care of. Fire insurance rates can still have different rates depending on the building grade, but the difference must be reduced as much as possible. Fire insurance rates should generally be lower than before the Anti-Japanese War and lower than the current rates. Transportation insurance rates can be greatly reduced compared to current rates. Publicly owned enterprises can still be given preferential treatment when insuring, and cooperatives can be even lower than publicly owned enterprises. When implementing compulsory insurance, special premium rates should be formulated separately. If private enterprises are insured systematically and comprehensively, they can be given preferential treatment as publicly owned enterprises.

　　The people's insurance industry is a new undertaking that will gradually develop into an extremely important social system during the period of peaceful production and construction in the future. However, the importance of this undertaking to the country and the people has not yet been noticed by many people. Therefore, extensive publicity should be carried out among the people to expand the scope of this undertaking to all industries, agriculture, commerce, and every enterprise sector, and even make every person have close economic ties with it, so that the people's insurance industry can become more sound and developed within three to five years under the general task of striving for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation, and seek large-scale and universal development in business, so that it truly becomes an economic organization that organizes collective mutual assistance, in order to achieve the goals of guaranteeing the wealth of the country and the people, accumulating funds, and expanding reproduction.

### 发展人民保险事业

　　发展人民保险事业
    人民保险事业，在中国，还是一个新兴的事业。它在国家经济建设中，有重要的作用。因为它可以防止和弥补各种灾害对于人民和国家所造成的经济损失。万一发生灾害时，可以使受灾企业能有恢复的资金，而不至于因为没有资金而陷于停顿，或因此增加国家财政的意外负担。同时，用保险的方法，可以开展人民储蓄，集中资金，帮助国家生产建设的恢复和发展。
    中国的保险事业，抗日战争以前，在国民党反动派统治时期，是基本上为帝国主义服务的，是随帝国主义的经济侵略而发展起来的，因此，这一事业，在开始时，就带有极大的买办性和掠夺性。抗日战争以前，全国保险费收入年约五千余万元，外商公司竟占四千万元以上。一九三七年统计，每年向国外流出的保险费约达二百三十五万英镑，占全国保险费收入的百分之七十五。当时华商公司仅仅是外商公司的经纪人。抗日战争时期，在沦陷了的中国，保险市场完全为日寇所控制。抗战胜利后，四大家族独占了保险事业，较有基础的私营保险业，亦完全变成了官僚资本所操纵的保险业的附庸。那时的保险事业，与其他金融事业一样，是以进行投机为主要业务。在保险业市场上，曾经表现出一种虚假繁荣，当时，华商公司曾一度达到三百六十九家之多。这些保险业，不但不扶助民族工商业，而且严重地损害了民族工商业。在解放以后，保险市场的这种状况，才根本改变过来。
    近一年来，人民保险事业的建设，已有相当成就。在接收了官僚买办资本的腐烂保险机构的基础上，迅速建立了全国统一的中国人民保险公司。在现已举办的十八种业务中，主要是承保财产的火灾险，物资的水陆运输险。在运输保险中，并包括运输工具险、运输物资兵险、匪劫险等，对于保护国家财产，沟通城乡物资，刺激进出口贸易等方面，均起了日益加大的辅导作用，若干企业得以大胆放手地经营业务。在保险方法上，人民保险公司注重地对各生产企业单位进行了防灾检查，积极地提出了改善防灾设备的建议，这就完全改变了过去单纯事后赔偿的旧传统，减少了生产企业的意外灾害。特别值得指出的，是人民保险事业已经开始注意面向农村，为广大农民服务，并取得了某些经验。虽然这种农业保险还只限于耕畜与棉花收获险，目前由于客观条件的限制，也只是在少数地区开始试办，但已经受到农民的欢迎与社会的赞助。这是新中国人民保险事业将来主要发展方向之一。此外，如各种人身保险，虽然由于现在条件还不成熟，还不可能很快的普遍推行，但将来整个国家财政经济基本好转，人民生活普遍上升之后，将是一种非常普及的具有远大发展前途的业务，也是人民长期储蓄的一种良好方式。目前华东试行的疾病津贴、生育、结婚、丧殓贷金等办法，切合广大劳动人民要求，则可以结合劳动保险的实施，在各地扩大试行。
    根据苏联先进的保险工作经验，今后中国人民保险事业，应该对国家与人民的主要财富由自愿保险走向强制保险。这样国家与人民的主要财富通过保险事业便可获得确切的保障。因为强制保险的实施，可以组织足够的经济力量，来大规模的防止和挽救生产企业中意外事件所招致的损失。并可组织大量的经济力量集中扶植主要生产事业，使经济力量大的地区，扶助经济力量小的地区或需要开发的地区。通过普遍性的强制保险事业，能较正确地了解全国经济情况与生产能力，有利于国家经济建设由分散的无政府状态逐渐走上有计划生产的道路。
    强制保险可争取在国营企业、国家机关财产首先实行，其次是各种乘客意外险，因这些业务比较容易强制实行。合作社的强制保险可先从县以上的总社办起，将来再发展到基层社。实行的步骤，目前可进行广泛的宣传，准备制定法令与制度，加强调查工作，调整机构与准备干部，从国家企业带头试办。不能立即全面强制实行的，还可以作局部地试办，但是强制保险，必须取得人民的拥护，否则单靠法令也是行不通的。
    对私营企业的保险工作，除火险及其他险应尽量争取早办外，重点应该放在运输险方面。由于私营贸易的比重还很大，为了更好的发挥城乡资本的积极性，以利于国民经济的恢复与发展，保险工作应和私人企业建立广泛的联系，并定出一定的计划，作为努力的目标。对主要城市的私营企业，应进行了解，尽量争取其投保。
    为减轻被保险人负担和减低生产成本，同时使广大人民都有享受保险权利的机会，应实行低费率政策。原则上应照顾工业，特别是重工业及作为重点发展的生产事业。对小城市及落后地区，负担能力小或新开辟保险业务的地区，亦应加以照顾。火险费率仍可因建筑等级的不同而有不同的费率，但必须尽量将差额缩小。火险费率一般应比抗战前低，比现行费率亦应减低。运输险则可照现行费率大量减低。公营企业投保仍可给予优待，合作社比公营企业还可再低一些。实行强制保险时，应单独制订专用费率。私营企业如系系统全面的投保，可照公营企业给予优待。
    人民保险事业是一个新兴的事业，在将来和平生产建设时期，将逐渐发展为一种极其重要的社会制度。但这个事业对于国家与人民的重要性，还未为许多人所注意，因此在人民中应该进行广泛的宣传，使这一事业的范围扩展到一切工业、农业、商业及每一个企业部门中去，甚至使每一个人都与之发生密切的经济联系，使人民保险事业在争取国家财政经济状况的根本好转的总任务下，在三五年内更加健全与发展起来，在业务方面求得大量普遍的开展，使之真正成为组织集体互助的经济组织，以达到保障国家与人民财富，集积资金，扩大再生产的目的。
