　　A Turning Point in European History
    ——Commemorating the First Anniversary of the Founding of the German Democratic Republic
    John Konig, Head of Mission of the German Democratic Republic to China, with the rank of Ambassador
    The founding of the German Democratic Republic on October 7, 1949, was an event of great historical significance for all the German people and for all of Europe. The true significance of this event was fully realized by the people – even the Germans – only after Marshal Stalin's congratulatory telegram to Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, and Otto Grotewohl, Prime Minister. In this congratulatory telegram, the historical situation created by the founding of the German Democratic Republic was illuminated as if by a giant searchlight. This congratulatory telegram pointed out the broad prospects of the events in Berlin on October 7, 1949. In the telegram, Stalin said: “The establishment of a democratic and peace-loving German Republic is a turning point in European history. There is no doubt that the coexistence of a peace-loving and democratic Germany with a peace-loving Soviet Union makes new wars impossible in Europe, ends the bloodshed in Europe, and makes it impossible for world imperialism to enslave European countries.
    "The experience of the recent war, in which the German and Soviet peoples bore the greatest sacrifices, shows that these two peoples possess the greatest potential in Europe to accomplish great actions of world importance. As long as these two peoples show the determination to fight for peace, as hard as they did in the war, then peace in Europe can be considered guaranteed.
    Therefore, your laying the foundation for a unified and peace-loving Germany is also doing a great thing for all of Europe, guaranteeing its lasting peace."
    The founding of the German Democratic Republic was the response of the democratic and patriotic forces of the German people to the new situation and the greatly intensified national crisis of the German people, which was created single-handedly by the policy of the Western occupying powers to divide Germany. The formation of the Bonn puppet state was the culmination of a systematic policy of division that the imperialist Western powers had long conspired to implement, openly violating the Potsdam Agreement of August 2, 1945; this is the agreement that Truman and Attlee also signed alongside Stalin's signature. In the Potsdam Agreement, it was clearly stipulated that the four powers occupying Germany after crushing the Hitler state and its unconditional surrender would implement a common policy, the purpose of which was to give the German people the possibility of transforming their lives on a democratic and peaceful basis.
    To this end, the Potsdam Agreement stipulated that during the occupation period, Germany must be administered as a unified whole. The goal of the occupation policy was to achieve the following specific tasks: to thoroughly eliminate fascism and militarism from the lives and thoughts of the German people, to disarm Germany and prohibit militarization.
    To purge fascists and militarists from the administrative organs, the education system, the judiciary, and all public life, and to destroy the economic and political power of large landowners, Junkers, and monopoly capital by implementing a democratic land reform and eliminating the monopoly institutions of capital – such as cartels, financial groups, trusts, and other monopoly organizations – as clearly stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement.
    At the same time, the Potsdam Agreement stipulated compensation for the peoples of countries damaged by German aggression, and adjusted the boundaries of Germany to preclude the possibility of a new German aggression, while enabling the German people and their neighbors, especially the Polish people, to have peaceful coexistence.
    The democratic and patriotic elements of Germany unconditionally recognized the historic resolutions of Potsdam and wholeheartedly supported them, because these resolutions made it possible for them to learn from the mistakes of German history, resolutely end the disastrous imperialist war policy, and embark on a new, democratic, and peaceful path.
    The Potsdam Agreement, fully agreed upon by the powers that organized the great anti-Hitler alliance during World War II, has become the most important and decisive document for the formation of international consultations on the German question. It is a decided and effective agreement under international law, which not only imposes obligations on the German people, but also guarantees them the right to a unified, democratic, peaceful, and independent Germany.
    One of the most prominent features of the development in Europe after World War II is the fact that the Potsdam Agreement was only implemented in one part of Germany, in the Soviet occupation zone. The Soviet army, which destroyed the Hitler regime, and the occupation organs of the Soviet government, used all their strength to promote and support the democratic forces of the German people in democratically transforming their lives in accordance with the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement. With the active support of the occupation organs and the Soviet government, those basic democratic reforms were completed. These reforms achieved a fundamental transformation of political and economic life in this part of Germany. A new democratic administrative structure was built up step by step. Land reform was completed, the achievement of which was the confiscation of approximately 2,167,000 hectares of land held by approximately 7,000 Junker landlords, which was distributed to 544,000 peasant families, farmhand families, and immigrant families. By confiscating the industrial property of monopoly capitalists and Nazi war criminals and returning their enterprises to the people, and by nationalizing the banks, the power of monopoly capital was smashed, and conditions were created for building a peaceful industry of the people's own on the basis of economic planning. A total of 4,011 industrial enterprises were nationalized. In mid-1950, these industrial enterprises accounted for 65 percent of total industrial production. Outside of the state-owned economy, in the former Soviet occupation zone (note), today in the German Democratic Republic, there are 7,300 private small and medium-sized enterprises. They have been freed from the deadly threat of monopoly capitalists by the new democratic order, and their private initiative is guaranteed within the scope of the law. In addition, there are a total of 300,000 handicraft enterprises and approximately 1 million workers. The people's own economic sphere created by this basic reform, in addition to the people's own enterprises, includes banks, railways, and insurance companies, part of the commercial state property and machine lending stations. They include the highest economic authority of the new democratic order and form a solid foundation for planned and crisis-free economic development.
    Due to the democratic school reform implemented in the former Soviet occupation zone, fundamental new situations have also been created in the field of cultural development. The bourgeois monopoly of education has been broken, and the doors of specialized schools have been opened to the children of workers and peasants. Because of this, and because of the further measures of the democratic school reform, a foundation has been created for education in the spirit of peace, democracy, and progress, and for the renewal of German culture.
    Due to this fundamental change in the political, economic, and cultural spheres, the road back to imperialism and fascism has been absolutely blocked in a part of German territory, and a new democratic order conforming to the basic principles of the Potsdam Agreement has been created: an anti-fascist democratic order. This great achievement was made possible because the Soviet Union, as an occupying power, faithfully fulfilled its duties in the spirit of the Potsdam Agreement. The Soviet Union and Marshal Stalin have shown themselves to be the most loyal friends of the German people. The Soviet people and the Soviet people's army also broke the chains of Hitler's fascism and the rule of the imperialists for the German people. They proved that they did not come to Germany as conquerors and avengers, but as liberators and friends of the German workers, peasants, and intellectuals. Due to the unconditional implementation of the Potsdam Agreement by the Soviet occupation authorities, the valuable assistance they gave to the democratic forces of the German people in political, economic, and cultural construction opened a road to a new and happy life for the German people on the basis of peace and democracy. (1)(4)
    In sharp contrast to this are the aims and results of the occupation policies of the imperialist Western powers. Shortly after the signing of the Potsdam Agreement, it became apparent that the Western powers had no intention of implementing the measures unanimously agreed upon in the agreement in their occupation zones. The background to the German policy of the Western bloc has become increasingly clear. The most important of these reasons is to strangle Germany's potential as a competitor in the world market, and to use West Germany within the political sphere to realize the US imperialists' plans to dominate the world and their aggressive plans.
    The imperialist Western powers have brought the people of West Germany the loss of national independence and sovereignty, political enslavement, economic control, and cultural decline. They have relied in the past and continue to rely on the reactionary forces of German imperialism – Hitler's generals, financial tycoons, bank bosses, and the traitor politicians from Adenauer to Schumacher. Under such a policy, it is not surprising that they not only obstruct even the slightest steps towards genuine democratization in West Germany, but also openly use all methods of barbaric terror to eradicate them. In violation of the Potsdam Agreement, they eventually divided Germany and formed a semi-colonial divided state in this divided area. Its real constitution is the dictatorial occupation law, its real government is the High Commissioner's Office of the imperialist Western powers, and its all-powerful president is the Wall Street bank boss McCloy. Due to the divisive and colonial policies of the imperialist Western powers, West Germany has become an arsenal and a launching base for the US to prepare for war against the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and democratic Germany, for which it now also has the task of supplying cannon fodder. The formation of a West German invasion force and mercenary army within the framework of the Atlantic Pact has been agreed upon in principle and decided upon by the traitorous groups around Adenauer and Schumacher, and has begun to be implemented. This policy has manifestly violated and continues to violate the German nation's right to life and existence. Finally, with the establishment of the Bonn divided state, the national crisis of the German people created by the imperialist warmongers and colonialists has reached its climax and most seriously threatens the survival of the German nation.
    This is the new situation in Germany, a situation that in early October of last year prompted all the democratic and patriotic forces of the German people to demand swift and decisive action to save the nation. A decisive act of national self-salvation was necessary to answer the divisive and war policies of the imperialist Western powers and their German lackeys, and to destroy once and for all the imperialists' hope of surrendering all of Germany to their colonial policies. This historic action, not only for the German nation but also for the whole of Europe, was completed with the founding of the German Democratic Republic on October 7, 1949. The Soviet government also once again showed itself to be the best friend of the German people in this situation, as it transferred the administrative organs that had been under Soviet military control to the government of the German Democratic Republic.
    The establishment of the German Democratic Republic is a great achievement of the National Front of Democratic Germany, which includes all German patriots, regardless of their class origin, their political beliefs, and their religious beliefs. The purpose of this front is to fight for a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany in accordance with the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement. Due to the serious crisis of the division of Germany, the colonialization of West Germany, and the threat to the national survival of the German people caused by the policies of British and American imperialists, the national question has become the most important life-and-death issue for the German people. The masses of the people, workers and peasants, intellectuals and the middle class in West Germany are now suffering double oppression. Their national liberation has become the prerequisite for their social liberation. National resistance against the divisive, colonial, and war policies of British and American imperialism, arming the masses, and leadership in this national resistance are now the important tasks of the National Front of Democratic Germany.
    Carrying out national resistance is not only a right of the German people, but also an obligation, because the occupying armies of the imperialist Western powers no longer carry out the tasks entrusted to them by the Potsdam Agreement on German soil, but serve a purpose directly contrary to the objectives of this agreement, so the presence of such armies on German soil has lost all legal basis. These armies are no longer occupying armies, but have become a completely interventionist army. These armies are engaged in suppressing the nation and building a military strategic launching base for the US to prepare for war against the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and democratic Germany. From this fact, the German people have the right to engage in national resistance and create conditions that make it possible for the Potsdam Agreement to be implemented in the West German region as well.
    The basis and main pillar of this national liberation struggle of the German people is the German Democratic Republic. The German Democratic Republic gives all the German people an example of how people can realize the democratization, reunification, and guarantee of peace for all of Germany. Its great achievements tell all the German people that prosperity can be won and how it can be won in all areas of social life in Germany. The example and achievements of the German Democratic Republic enable the people of the whole country to recognize the enormous power of the unity of all democratic forces achieved in the German Democratic Republic. In fact, the achievements of the German Democratic Republic since its establishment have been enormous. Here are just a few of the achievements in the economic sphere from many events:
    The two-year plan from 1949 to 1950 was completed in one and a half years and will be overfulfilled by the end of 1950. The purpose of the two-year plan was to reach 81 percent of the 1936 industrial production level by the end of 1950. This goal was already achieved in mid-1950. Industrial production at the end of 1950 will reach peacetime standards, with 103.1 percent of 1936 production. Labor productivity will increase by 30 percent by the end of 1950. This goal has also been exceeded in the mid-quarter of 1950. If we take the labor productivity of 1936 as 100, then the development from 1947 to June 1950 is: 1947 – 56 percent, 1949 – 85 percent, June 1950 – 93.8 percent.
    The three-year plan stipulates that production costs should be reduced by 7 percent by the end of 1950. However, this goal has already been exceeded by reducing them by 7.3 percent by the end of the first year of the two-year plan. The plan stipulated that wage increases by the end of 1950 would be 15 percent, but the actual wage increase in the mid-quarter of 1950 has reached 22 percent.
    The achievements in the field of agricultural economy are no less significant. The set goal of reaching the "peacetime yield per hectare" has been achieved this year. The planned supply of artificial fertilizers in the agricultural economy has been overfulfilled, and the total cultivated area has reached the pre-war level as planned. In addition, all planned targets for increasing the number of livestock have been greatly exceeded. The democratic government has vigorously helped the laboring peasants and built a total of 524 machine and tractor stations, with 11,950 tractors, 14,090 tractor plows, and a considerable number of mechanical implements pulled by tractors.
    As a result of these significant achievements, the lives of the people of the German Democratic Republic have been greatly improved. Food consumption in the mid-quarter of 1950 was 150 percent higher than in 1948 and 20.8 percent higher than in 1949. The increase in industrial production has also greatly improved the supply of industrial goods to the people. The actual income of the working people has increased not only due to wage increases, but also due to the huge price reductions implemented by state-owned trading institutions and the systematic and significant increase in the large amount of daily necessities distributed to the people at low prices. Due to the six major price reductions carried out by state-owned trading institutions since November 1948, the price of food has been reduced by 82.5 percent, and the price of industrial goods has been reduced by 73.3 percent, so that the difference between the price of rationed goods and the price of goods in state-owned stores is getting smaller and smaller, and will be completely eliminated in the near future when production increases further. Due to the increase in agricultural production, the rationing of some major foods has been lifted. Potatoes, vegetables, and fruits are actually being supplied at low prices without limit. The rations of meat, oil, etc. have also been increased by 150 to 200 percent. The development of prices in state-owned stores is even more evident from the following comparison. Two years ago, one hundred marks could buy half a pound of butter, one pound of sausage, one pound of flour, a small white bread, and a small box of sweets. But today, one hundred marks can buy one pound of margarine, half a pound of butter, one pound of fine meat sausage, one pound of red sausage, one can of meat, ten eggs, two pounds of flour, half a pound of oatmeal, a large cake, a white bread, one pound of cereal flour, one pound of jam, one pound of noodles, 125 grams each of fudge candy and biscuits, one can each of applesauce, pineapple, and salad oil, one bottle of milk, one can of canned lentils, 125 grams of chocolate candy, one bottle of wine, one bottle of beer, and three pastries. These huge achievements have been reached without the German Democratic Republic owing a penny of debt. Her budget is balanced and even has a surplus. At the same time, the Bonn divided state created a budget deficit of more than 3 billion marks in 1950 and a debt of more than 20 billion marks to foreign monopoly capital.
    How were these truly great achievements obtained? The lasting and multifaceted friendly assistance of the Soviet Union created the preconditions for them. In addition, they are mainly the result of the labor enthusiasm and creative power of the working people, who have established a new relationship to their work after abolishing capitalist exploitation in public factories. On May 1, 1950, there were 95,000 labor models who were rewarded for their outstanding achievements in the fields of increased production and increased labor productivity. This fact is a vivid proof of the rapid unfolding of a new consciousness among the working people after the implementation of new scientific work standards in state-owned factories. These labor models take the lead in work competitions, improve work organization, use inventions to increase production, save raw materials, and manufacture better quality products. In addition, the decisive reason for these great achievements of the German Democratic Republic is the unity between the working class and the laboring peasants under the leadership of the working class, the unity between the workers and the laboring intellectuals, and, above all, the unity of the working class and the consistency of action of all democratic forces in the consolidation and development of the new democratic order.
    Past achievements are just the beginning. A new leap forward for the people of the German Democratic Republic will unfold with the five-year plan, which will be implemented from January 1, 1951. This plan is a great program of new construction. Its main tasks are: to increase industrial production to 200 percent of 1936; to increase the yield per hectare by 25 percent compared to 1950; to increase labor productivity by 60 percent compared to 1950; to reduce the production cost of public factories by 23 percent compared to 1950, and to increase wages and salaries by 20 percent compared to 1950. At the same time, the five-year plan is also a program for the rapid cultural leap forward of the masses of the people. In the process of its implementation, the German Democratic Republic will reach the pre-war living standards in 1952. And in 1955, its final year, the living standards of the people of the German Democratic Republic will greatly exceed those before the war. In this way, the German Democratic Republic will accomplish its basic task in the current situation, demonstrate to all the German people the superiority of the anti-fascist democratic order existing in the German Democratic Republic, and convince them that the path taken by the German Democratic Republic in the economic and cultural spheres is an example for all of Germany.
    The foreign policy of the German Democratic Republic is also an example for all of Germany. Its great achievements to date indicate to all the German people that the path taken by the German Democratic Republic is the only correct path to lead the German people to join the family of peace-loving nations. This foreign policy is clear and simple. Its foundation is mainly the inseparable friendship and cooperation with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries and peace-loving nations. The peaceful and strong friendship and close cooperation with the Soviet Union is a necessary prerequisite for the prosperity of the German Democratic Republic and, indeed, for its national survival. The German Democratic Republic, its government, and the National Front of Democratic Germany consider it to be a member of the great world front for peace and democracy under the leadership of the Soviet Union, and act accordingly. The 19 million signatures collected in the German Democratic Republic for the Stockholm Appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Congress for Peace prove this, the great German Youth Peace Congress held in Berlin this May proves this, and the struggle of the National Front of Democratic Germany proves this. The struggle for the national interests of the German people, for a unified democratic Germany, for a democratic peace treaty, and for the withdrawal of all occupying forces is closely linked to the struggle to defend peace and oppose the British and American warmongers – who are also the main enemies of the German people. Therefore, the foreign policy of the German Democratic Republic, as President Wilhelm Pieck recently announced, is based on the following principles:
    "(1) Strive for peace, for the prohibition of atomic weapons, and for the declaration of the government that first uses atomic weapons as a war criminal. Resolutely and actively struggle against the German warmongers. We declare all obligations and agreements that involve Germany in a new war and in an aggressive bloc – including the European Council, the North Atlantic Treaty, and the Schuman Plan – to be crimes against the German people. We will never recognize all such obligations and agreements as legitimate.
    We declare our complete and unlimited support for all forces in the world that strive for peace and for equality and friendship among nations.
    (2) Strive for the rapid conclusion of a just peace treaty with Germany and, accordingly, the withdrawal of all occupying forces in Germany.
    (3) Restore the political and economic unity of Germany on a democratic and peaceful basis.
    (4) Establish close and strong friendly relations between Germany and the great Soviet Union – the fortress of world peace and democracy, and comprehensively develop our economic and cultural relations with the Soviet Union.
    (5) Establish friendly relations with the people's democratic countries – the People's Republic of China, Korea, Vietnam, and all other peace-loving countries, and develop our economic and cultural relations with them.
    (6) Restore friendly relations with all countries that pursue a policy of peace and respect the national interests of the German people.
    (7) Fully and unconditionally recognize the decisions of the Potsdam Agreement regarding the democratization of Germany and the obligations stipulated therein for Germany to other nations.
    (8) Honestly and sincerely fulfill the international obligations in the agreements concluded between the German Democratic Republic and other countries.
    (9) Establish free and unimpeded relations between Germany and the world market. In particular, promote commercial relations with the Soviet Union, China, and Eastern and Southeastern Europe, and treat them as Germany's natural business partners. Conclude long-term commercial agreements with all countries that provide German industry with a definite sales market and raw materials and semi-finished products.
    (10) Comprehensively strengthen the German Democratic Republic as a fortress of peace and democracy in Germany."
    The implementation of these policies by the government of the German Democratic Republic depends on the unity and solidarity of all patriotic and democratic forces of the German people, who are united in the National Front of Democratic Germany to fight together for national salvation. This unity was evident in the elections to the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic and the state parliaments, county councils, and township councils of the Republic on October 15. In accordance with the unanimous resolution of the anti-fascist democratic parties and mass organizations united in the democratic group, the election was held on the basis of a common list of candidates and a common election program. These resolutions were approved at the first German People's Congress held in Berlin this August. More than 7,000 delegates and guests attended this congress, including more than 1,500 from West Germany. The congress voted on the common election program of the National Front of Democratic Germany, which reflected the living interests of the people of the whole country – except for a small handful of German traitors. If the voters of the German Democratic Republic voted in favor of the common candidates and the election program of the National Front of Democratic Germany on October 15, then they also voted in favor of the struggle for peace and also voted in favor of the struggle for a unified democratic Germany. The vote for the common list of candidates was also a vote of confidence in the new road in German history towards a new democratic order that has been taken in East Germany since 1945. This election will further strengthen the new democratic order and consolidate the German Democratic Republic as the basis and main pillar of the national liberation struggle of all the German people. Therefore, this election is of great significance not only for all the German people, but also for the whole of Europe. The patriotic and democratic forces of Germany are conscious of the great responsibility placed on their shoulders. They have confirmed the historical significance of the founding of the German Democratic Republic mentioned in Marshal Stalin's congratulatory telegram cited at the beginning of this article. The patriotic and democratic forces of Germany are determined to do their utmost to fulfill their historical tasks. They recognize that consolidating the German Democratic Republic and its anti-fascist democratic order and launching the national resistance against the imperialist conquerors in West Germany is their main task. Their will and determination to accomplish this task, as well as the unparalleled support of the world's peace-loving forces led by the Soviet Union, are a guarantee of realizing the great vision pointed out by Stalin. The fact that the National Front of Democratic Germany is a member of the great world peace camp under the leadership of the great Stalin is a guarantee that the imperialists' plans will be prevented or suffer a shameful defeat, and that the struggle for a unified, democratic, and peace-loving republic of Germany will crush all resistance and achieve victory.
    From the lessons of the victory won and to be won by the Chinese people in the war of liberation from the semi-colonial and semi-feudal system of enslavement under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the German people are also sure that their just struggle will be victorious. This victory of the Chinese people is a fatal blow to international imperialism and, with the establishment of the People's Republic of China, has created the prerequisites for a happy and peaceful life for the Chinese people.
    Democratic Germany sees with brotherly joy and admiration the great achievements of the Chinese people, with whom it feels closely connected. This victory of the Chinese people in their war of liberation makes a major contribution to Germany by assuring the German people that their liberation struggle will be victoriously completed with the help of peace-loving peoples around the world.
    Democratic and peace-loving Germany knows that their just struggle will be victorious – because the powerful Soviet Union and our great teacher and leader Stalin are helping us as the best friends of the German people.
    Note: The territory of the German Democratic Republic today is the former Soviet occupation zone. In the past, according to the Potsdam Agreement, the Soviet military government, which exercised supreme power and administrative functions, has transferred these powers to the government of the German Democratic Republic. The establishment of the Soviet Control Commission to replace the Soviet military government is to supervise the German Democratic Republic's implementation of the terms of the Potsdam Agreement.

　　欧洲历史的转折点
    ——纪念德意志民主共和国成立一周年
    德意志民主共和国驻华外交使团大使衔团长  约翰·柯尼希
    德意志民主共和国在一九四九年十月七日的成立，对于全德人民进而对于全欧洲是一个有伟大历史意义的事件。这个事件的真正意义，由于斯大林大元帅给德意志民主共和国的总统威廉·皮克和总理奥托·格罗提渥的贺电才使人们——甚至德国的人们——完全意识到。在这个贺电中，由于德意志民主共和国的成立而创造的历史形势，像是被一个巨大的探照灯照耀着。这个贺电指示出一九四九年十月七日柏林事件的广大远景。在贺电中，斯大林说：“德意志民主的爱好和平的共和国的成立是欧洲历史的转折点。无可怀疑，爱好和平的民主德国与爱好和平的苏联之并肩存在使得欧洲不再有新战争的可能，结束欧洲的流血并使世界帝国主义奴役欧洲国家成为不可能。
    “最近这次战争的经验表明，在这次战争中担负牺牲最大的是德国和苏联的人民，表明这两国人民在欧洲拥有最大的潜力，以完成有世界重要性的伟大行动。只要这两国人民表现决心为和平而战，像他们在战争时那样努力，那末和平在欧洲可以认为有了保证。
    因此，你们奠定统一与爱好和平之德国的基础，同时就是对全欧洲作了伟大的事情，保证其持久和平。”
    德意志民主共和国的成立是德国人民的民主的与爱国的力量对于新情况、对于德国人民的大大尖锐化的民族危机的回答，这危机是由西方占领列强分裂德国的政策一手造成的。波恩傀儡国家的组成是帝国主义的西方列强很久以来所阴谋的有系统的分裂政策的登峰造极，他们实行这个政策，公开破坏了一九四五年八月二日的波茨坦协定；这就是在斯大林的签字之旁杜鲁门和艾德礼也签了字的那个协定。在波茨坦协定中明确地规定，在击碎希特勒国家和它无条件投降后占领德国的四强实行一个共同的政策，其目的就是在给德国人民一种可能性：在民主和平的基础上实现他们的生活改造。
    为了这个目的，波茨坦协定规定：在占领期内德国必须当作一个统一的整体来管理。占领政策的目标就是实现下面具体的任务：从德国人民的生活与思想中彻底消灭法西斯主义与军国主义，解除德国的武装与禁止军事化。
    肃清行政机关、教育制度、司法、全体公共生活中的法西斯分子和军国主义者，并且以实行一个民主的土地改革以及消灭资本的独占机构——如波茨坦协定中明确规定的——“企业组合、财团、托辣斯和其他独占组织”，来摧毁大地主、容克地主和独占资本的经济政治势力。
    同时波茨坦协定规定对于受德国侵略损害的各国人民的赔偿，并且这样调整规定德国的边界使它们排除一个新的德国侵略的可能性，同时使德国人民和他的邻国，特别是波兰人民能够有一个和平的共存。
    德国的民主和爱国人士无条件的承认波茨坦历史性的决议，并且全心全意的拥护，因为这些决议使他们可能从德国历史的迷途中学到教训，断然结束招致灾害的帝国主义的战争政策，而走上一条新的、民主的与和平的道路。
    在第二次世界大战时组织伟大的反希特勒同盟的列强完全同意的波茨坦协定，已成为关于德国问题的形成的国际协商的最重要最有决定性的文件。这是一个在国际公法上决定的而且有效的协定，它不只使德国人民担负义务，却也给他们保证有一个统一、民主、和平与独立的德国的权利。
    第二次世界大战之后，在欧洲发展的一个最突出的特征就是这样的事实：波茨坦协定只在德国的一部分，在苏联占领区内实现了。毁灭了希特勒统治的苏军以及苏联政府的占领机构，在按照波茨坦协定的规定民主地改造生活时，用全力促进和支持德国人民的民主力量。借着占领机构和苏联政府的积极支持，那些基本的民主改革得以完成。这些改革在德国的这一部分达到政治与经济生活的基本改造。一个新的民主的行政机构一步一步的建设起来。土改完成了，土改的成绩是没收了七千个左右容克地主所据有的二百一十六万七千公顷的土地，分给五十四万四千农民家庭、雇农家庭和移民家庭。由于没收独占资本家和纳粹战犯的工业财产和把他们的企业交还人民所有，由于银行国有化打垮了独占资本的势力，并且在经济计划的基础上创立了建设一个人民自己的和平工业的条件，总共有四千零十一个工业企业收归国有，在一九五○年年中这种工业企业，在全体工业生产上占百分之六十五。在国营经济以外，在从前的苏联占领区（注），今天在德意志民主共和国，存在着七千三百个私人的小企业和中等企业。它们被新的民主秩序从独占资本家致人死命的威胁中解放出来，而且它们的私人积极性在法律范围中被保证了。此外有整整三十万手工企业和大概一百万工作者。被这个基本改革所创造的人民自己的经济领域，除去人民自己的企业外，属于这个领域的有银行铁路和保险公司，一部分商业国家财产和机器出借站，它们包括新的民主秩序的经济的最高权威，组成了有计划避免危机的经济发展的坚固基础。
    由于在从前苏联占领区实行的民主的学校改革，在文化发展的领域上也创造出来基本的新的情势。资产阶级的教育独占被打破了，专门学校的大门为工农子弟打开。由于这点，而且由于民主的学校改革的更进一步的措施，创造了为和平、民主和进步的精神中的教育，为德国文化的革新创造了基础。
    由于这个在政治、经济和文化的领域上的基本改变，所以在德国的一部分领土上回到帝国主义和法西斯的道路绝对被阻塞了，而且创造了一个合于波茨坦协定基本原则的新的民主秩序：一个反法西斯的民主的秩序。这伟大成绩之所以成为可能，就是因为苏联以占领国的身份忠实于波茨坦协定的精神执行他的职务。苏联和斯大林大元帅表现出是德国人民最忠实的朋友。苏联人民、苏联人民的军队也为德国人民打碎了希特勒法西斯的锁练和帝国主义者的统治。他们证明了他们不是以征服者和报复者的身份来到德国，而是以德国工人、农民和知识分子的解放者和朋友的身份来到德国的。由于苏联各占领当局无条件实行波茨坦协定，它们在政治经济和文化的建设上对德国人民的民主力量所给与的宝贵帮助，给德国人民在和平与民主的基础上打开了一条走向新的幸福生活的道路。（⑴⑷）
    恰恰与此相反的是帝国主义的西方列强占领政策的目的和结果。在波茨坦协定签字不久之后就已经显示出，西方列强没有想到在他们的占领区，实行在协定中一致商定的措施。西方集团的德国政策的背景越来越清楚地显露出来。这些原因中最重要的是扼杀德国在世界市场上可能成为竞争者，而且在政治范围内利用西德以实现美国帝国主义者的统治世界计划与侵略计划。
    帝国主义的西方列强给西德的人民带来民族独立主权的丧失，政治的奴役，经济的控制和文化的衰落。他们过去和现在都依靠德国帝国主义的反动力量——希特勒的将军、财阀大亨、银行老板和从阿登纳到舒马赫这批叛国政客。在这样一个政策下，他们不仅对于西德真正实行民主化最微小的步骤也加以阻挠，却还公开用野蛮恐怖政策的一切方法来铲除它们，是不足为怪的。在波茨坦协定的破坏下，他们终归分裂了德国，在这块分裂出来的区域中组成了一个半殖民地的分裂国家。它的真正宪法就是独裁的占领法规，它的真正政府就是帝国主义西方列强的高级专员公署，它的全能的总统就是华尔街的银行老板麦克洛埃。由于帝国主义西方列强的分裂政策和殖民政策，西德就变成一个为了美国准备反对苏联、反对人民民主国家和民主德国的战争的兵工厂和进军基地，对此它如今还有供给炮灰的任务。一个西德侵略军和雇佣军的组成在大西洋公约体系范围内原则上已经得到阿登纳和舒马赫周围的叛国集团的同意而决定了，且已着手进行。这政策过去和现在都显明地在破坏德国民族的生活权利与生存。最后随着波恩分裂国家的建立，被帝国主义战争煽动者与殖民者们所制造的德国人民的民族危机达到顶点，而且最严重地威胁着德国民族的生存。
    这是德国的新情况，这种情况在去年十月初使德国人民一切民主和爱国的力量要求迅速而坚决的行动去挽救民族。一个民族自救的断然行动，以答复帝国主义西方列强和他们德国走狗的分裂政策与战争政策，并一举而永久毁灭帝国主义者使全德国向他们的殖民政策投降的希望，是必要的。这个有历史意义的行动，不只为了德国民族，却也为了整个欧洲，随着一九四九年十月七日德意志民主共和国的成立而完成了。苏联政府也在这种情况中再度表示是德国人民的最好的朋友，因为它把一直由苏联军事管制的行政机构移交给德意志民主共和国政府。
    德意志民主共和国的建立是民主德国的全国阵线的伟大成就，这阵线包括一切德国的爱国分子，不论他的阶级出身、他们的政治信念和他们的宗教信仰，这阵线之目的是争取一个与波茨坦协定条文相符合的统一、民主和爱好和平的德国。由于分裂德国、西德殖民地化和德意志人民的民族生存被英美帝国主义者的政策所唤起的严重的危机，民族问题就成为德国人民最重要的生死问题了。西德的人民大众、工人和农民、知识分子和中等阶层现在忍受着双重压迫。他们的民族解放成为他们社会解放的前提。反对英美帝国主义的分裂政策、殖民地政策和战争政策的民族反抗，武装群众和在这个民族反抗中的领导，现在成为民主德国的全国阵线的重要任务。
    实行民族反抗不只是德国人民的一个权利，却也是一个义务，因为帝国主义西方列强的占领军在德国土地上不再实行波茨坦协定所赋与他们的任务，却服务于一个直接与这个协定目标相反的目的，所以这种军队的驻在德国土地上已失却一切法律根据。这些军队不再是占领军队，却成为一个彻头彻尾的干涉军队了。这些军队从事于压制民族，并且为了美国准备反对苏联、人民民主国家和民主德国的战争建立一个军事战略的进军基地。从这事实里，德国人民有权利从事民族的反抗，创造这样的条件，使波茨坦协定在西德地区也可能实行。
    德国人民的这个民族解放斗争的基础和主要支柱是德意志民主共和国。德意志民主共和国给全德国人民一个榜样——人们怎样能够实现全德的民主化，重新统一与保证和平。它的伟大成就告诉全德人民，在社会生活的一切领域中能够争取到并且怎样能够争取到德国的兴旺。德意志民主共和国的榜样和成就，使全国人民可以认识在德意志民主共和国实现的一切民主力量的统一有怎样巨大的力量。事实上，德意志民主共和国自从它成立以来所获的成绩是巨大的。下面从许多事件中只叙述几件在经济范围内所获得的成绩：
    一九四九到一九五○的两年计划一年半就完成了，到一九五○年底将要超额完成。二年计划的目的是到一九五○年底达到一九三六年的工业生产水平的百分之八十一。这个目的在一九五○年年中已经就达到了。一九五○年底的工业生产将要以一九三六年生产的百分之一百零三点一，达到和平时期的标准。劳动生产率到一九五○年底，将提高百分之三十。这个目标也同样在一九五○年中季已经超过了。我们把一九三六年的劳动生产率作为一○○，那么一九四七年至一九五○年六月的发展则是：一九四七年——百分之五十六，一九四九年——百分之八十五，一九五○年六月——百分之九十三·八。
    三年计划规定到一九五○年底生产成本应该减低百分之七。可是这个目标已经在二年计划的第一年底以达到了减低百分之七·三而超过了。计划中规定到一九五○年底的工资增加是百分之十五，但实际一九五○年中季的工资增加已达百分之二十二。
    在农业经济领域中所获得的成就也并不少。所设定的达到“和平时期每公顷收获量”的目标已在本年达到了。所计划的农业经济中人工肥料的供给已超过计划完成了，而全部耕种面积也如计划所规定的达到了战前的水准。此外一切关于家畜的养额增加的计划目标都大大的超过了。民主政府大力帮助劳动农民，共建设了五二四所机器与拖拉机站，拥有一一、九五○架拖拉机，一四、○九○架拖拉机犁及相当数量的用拖拉机拖带的机械。
    这些重大的成就的结果是德意志民主共和国人民的生活已经大大地改善了。一九五○年中季食物消费量高于一九四八年的百分之一五○，高于一九四九年百分之二○·八。工业生产量的增加，也使对人民的工业用品的供给大大地改善了。劳动人民的实际收入，不仅因工资增加而提高，同时也因国营贸易机构所实行的巨额减价以及同时向人民配给及低价配售的大量生活品也有系统地大大地增加了。由于国营贸易机构自一九四八年十一月以来所进行的六次大减价，使得食物的价格减低了百分之八二·五，工业品的价格减低了百分之七三·三，以致配给品的价格和国营商店货品的价格的相差越来越少，而在不久的将来，在生产更为增加时就要完全消灭了。由于农业生产的增加，对于一些主要食物的配给已经取消了。马铃薯、菜蔬、水果，实际上面色也都在用低价无限供给。肉类、油类等的配给额也同样增加了百分之一五○至二○○。关于国营商店价格的发展由下面的比较里更看得明显。在两年前用一百马克可以买半磅黄油、一磅香肠、一磅面粉、一小个白面包和一小盒甜点心。但在今天一百马克可买一磅人造黄油、半磅黄油、一磅精肉香肠、一磅红香肠、一罐肉、十个鸡蛋、两磅面粉、半磅燕麦片、一块大蛋糕、一个白面包、一磅谷粉、一磅果酱、一磅面条、软糖果、饼干各一二五瓦、苹果酱、黄梨、生菜油各一罐、一瓶牛乳、一罐头扁豆、一二五瓦巧克力糖、一瓶酒、一瓶啤酒和三块点心。达到了这些巨大的成就，并未使德意志民主共和国欠了一分钱的债。她的预算平衡了，甚至还有剩余。在这同时，在波恩的分裂国家却在一九五○年造成了三十亿马克以上的预算赤字，和对外国独占资本的二百亿马克以上的负债。
    这些真正伟大的成就是怎样获得的呢？由于苏联的持久与多方面的友谊帮助创造了它们的前提。此外主要是他们在公营工厂中废除了资本剥削后，对他们的工作建立起新的关系，劳动人民的劳动热情和创造力量的结果。在一九五○年五月一日，由于在生产增加和劳动生产力提高的领域中，获得优越成绩而受到奖赏的劳动模范有九万五千人。这个事实，是国营工厂实行了新的科学化的工作标准以后，劳动人民的急速展开的新觉悟的一个生动的证明。这些劳动模范在工作竞赛中带头，改善工作组织，用发明提高生产，节省原料并制造质量更好的产品。此外德意志民主共和国的这些伟大成就的决定性的原因，是工人阶级和劳动农民间的在工人阶级领导下的团结，工人和劳动知识分子间的团结和主要的是工人阶级的统一以及在新的民主秩序的巩固和发展中一切民主力量的行动的一致。
    过去的成就仅仅是一个开端。德意志民主共和国人民的新的跃进，将以一九五一年一月一日开始实行的五年计划而展开。这计划是新建设的伟大纲领。它的主要任务是：把工业生产提高到一九三六年的百分之二百；把每公顷收获量提高为比一九五○年增高百分之二十五；把劳动生产力提高为比一九五○增高百分之六十；把公有工厂的生产成本减低为比一九五○年低百分之二十三，而把工资薪金增加为比一九五○年增加百分之二十。同时五年计划也是人民大众急速的文化跃进的纲领。在它的实施过程中德意志民主共和国将于一九五二年达到战前的生活水准。而在一九五五年，它的最后一年，德意志民主共和国人民的生活水准将大大地超过战前。这样，德意志民主共和国将达成她在现情况下的基本任务，向全德人民证明在德意志民主共和国存在着的反法西斯民主秩序的优越性，并使他们确信德意志民主共和国在经济上和文化上所走的道路是全德国的榜样。
    德意志民主共和国的外交政策，也是全德国的榜样。它至今的伟大成就指示给全德人民，德意志民主共和国所走的道路是领导德国人民参加爱好和平各民族的家庭的唯一正确道路。这个外交政策是明白而简单的。它的基础主要的是和苏联及各人民民主国家和爱好和平各民族的不可分的友谊与合作。和苏联的和平的坚强的友谊和紧密合作是德意志人民共和国的富强、简直是它的民族生存的必要前提。德意志民主共和国，她的政府和民主德国的全国阵线认为她是在苏联领导下的争取和平与民主的伟大世界阵线的一员，并且也这样做。在德意志民主共和国为世界保卫和平大会常设委员会斯德哥尔摩宣言所征集的一千九百万签名证明了这一点，本年五月在柏林所举行的伟大的德国青年和平大会证明了这一点，而民主德国全国阵线的斗争也证明了这一点。争取德国人民的民族利益、争取统一的民主的德国、争取民主的和平条约、争取一切占领军的撤退的斗争，是和保卫和平及反对英美战争贩子——这同时也是德国人民的主要敌人——的斗争紧密联系着的。因此德意志民主共和国的外交政策如威廉·皮克总统最近所宣布的，是建立在以下的原则上的：
    “（一）争取和平、争取禁用原子武器和把第一个使用原子武器的政府宣布为战犯。坚决和积极地斗争以反对德国的战争贩子。我们宣布一切把德国牵入一个新战争、牵入侵略集团——包括欧洲委员会、北大西洋公约及舒曼计划——的义务和协定都是对德国人民的犯罪。所有这种义务和协定我们决不承认它是合法的。
    我们宣布全部地无限地支持全世界争取和平、争取各民族间的平等、友好的力量。
    （二）争取迅速缔结一个公正的对德和约并据此撤退一切在德占领军。
    （三）在民主的和平的基础上，恢复德国政治的经济的统一。
    （四）建立德国同伟大的苏联——全世界和平民主的堡垒间的紧密的坚强的友好关系，全面地发展我们同苏联间的经济文化关系。
    （五）建立与各人民民主国家——中华人民共和国、朝鲜、越南和其他一切爱好和平各国人民的友好关系，并发展我们同他们的经济的文化的关系。
    （六）同一切推行和平政策，尊重德国人民民族利益的国家、恢复友好关系。
    （七）全部地、无条件地承认波茨坦协定关于德国民主化的决定，及其中所规定德国对其他各国人民的义务。
    （八）正直地、真诚地履行德意志民主共和国和其他国家缔结的协定中的国际义务。
    （九）建立德国和世界市场的自由的无阻碍的关系。特别促进同苏联、中国和东欧、东南欧间的商务关系，把它们做为德国自然的商业关系人。同一切供给德国工业以确定的销场以及原料和半制品的国家缔结长期的商务协定。
    （十）全面地加强作为在德国的和平民主的堡垒的德意志民主共和国。”
    德意志民主共和国政府之实施这些政策，依赖一切德国人民的爱国和民主势力的统一和团结，它们在民主德国的全国阵线中为救国而团结起来共同斗争。这种统一在十月十五日所举行的德意志民主共和国人民议会及共和国各州州议会、县议会和乡议会的选举中有明显的表现。依照民主团体中所团结的各反法西斯民主党派及群众团体的一致决议，此次选举是用共同的候选人名单在共同选举纲领的基础上举行的。这些决议在本年八月在柏林举行的第一次德国人民代表大会上得到了批准。参加这大会的代表和来宾共七千余人，其中有一千五百余人是从西德来的。这大会表决了民主德国全国阵线的共同选举纲领，这纲领表现了全国人民——除一小撮的德国叛徒外——的生活利益。假如在十月十五日德意志民主共和国选民投票赞成共同候选人和民主德国全国阵线的选举纲领的话，那他们也就赞成了争取和平的斗争同时也赞成了争取统一的民主的德国的斗争。对于共同候选人名单的投票，同时也是对于一九四五年以来在东德所走的、走向新的民主秩序的德国人民历史上的新道路的信任投票。这次选举将使新的民主秩序更加强固，使德意志民主共和国在作为全德人民民族解放斗争的基础和主要支柱上更加巩固，因此这次选举不仅对于全德人民，就是对于全欧洲也有很大的意义。德国爱国的和民主的势力对于负在他们肩上的巨大责任是有自觉的。他们确认了本文开始所引的斯大林大元帅在他的贺电中关于德意志民主共和国成立的历史意义。德国爱国的和民主的势力决心用全力完成他们的历史任务。他们认识了巩固德意志民主共和国及其反法西斯民主秩序以及展开对西德帝国主义征服者的民族的抵抗是他们的主要任务。他们完成这任务的意志和决心及以苏联为首的世界爱好和平势力对于他们无比的支持，是实现斯大林所指出的伟大远景的保证。民主德国全国阵线是在伟大的斯大林领导下的伟大的世界和平阵营的一员的斗争，这事实是阻止帝国主义者的计划或使之遭受可耻失败，并使争取统一的德国民主的爱好和平的共和国的斗争摧毁一切反抗而获致胜利的保证。
    从中国人民在毛泽东主席领导下对于半殖民地半封建的奴役制度的解放战争所获得然要获得的胜利教训中，德国人民也确知他们的合理斗争必获胜利。中国人民的这个胜利给国际帝国主义一个致命的打击，而且随着中华人民共和国的成立给中国人民创造了幸福而和平生活的前提。
    民主的德国以兄弟般的愉快和景慕看到它感觉和它紧密连系着的中国人民的伟大成就。中国人民在他们解放战争中的胜利对德国主要的贡献，是使德国人民确信他们的解放斗争在爱好和平各国人民的帮助下将要胜利地完成。
    民主和爱好和平的德国知道它们合理的斗争将要胜利——因为强大的苏联与我们伟大的导师和领袖斯大林以德国人民最好朋友的身份在帮助我们。
    注：德意志民主共和国今天的辖境即以前的苏联占领区。过去根据波茨坦协定，执行最高权力和行政职务的苏联军政府已将这些权力移交给德意志民主共和国政府。苏联管制委员会之建立以代替苏联军政府，其职务为监督德意志民主共和国执行波茨坦协定的条款。
