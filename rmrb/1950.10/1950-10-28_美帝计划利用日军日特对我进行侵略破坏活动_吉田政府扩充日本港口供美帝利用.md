Xinhua News Agency, Dispatch from Tokyo, October 27th— Dentsu News Agency, Manila, October 26th: At least one senior U.S. Army officer recently left here for Tokyo to participate in discussions between Willoughby, head of MacArthur's Allied General Headquarters intelligence group, and former Japanese Lieutenant General Sakurai. The subject of the discussions was the use of Japanese troops in any military action that the United States might take in the Far East or Southeast Asia.

The discussions will be based on a draft proposal submitted to MacArthur by a group of former senior Japanese officers led by Sakurai. The focus of this draft is on using former Japanese soldiers to carry out American military plans, especially against China.

Sakurai and other generals have suggested establishing several strong "volunteer armies" in Japan, composed of former officers and soldiers with experience in fighting in China, Burma, and Indochina. Sakurai's suggestion points out that these armies, after special training (including parachute training), could be used to assist Chiang Kai-shek in the event of military action against the People's Republic of China.

Another key point of Sakurai's suggestion is to establish organizations to direct sabotage and terrorist activities behind the lines in the People's Republic of China. Sakurai believes that these organizations should include cadres from former Japanese paratrooper units and technicians from the Japanese Imperial Air Force.

Willoughby has been instructed to work with Sakurai to draft a clear plan based on Sakurai's suggestions, which will then be submitted by MacArthur to the Department of Defense in Washington.

Xinhua News Agency, Dispatch from Tokyo, October 27th— The Japanese Yoshida government is using the construction of "international ports" and "international cultural tourism cities" as a cover to turn Japanese ports and inland cities into military bases and colonies, to facilitate their American masters' use. According to a report by the United Press, the ports and cities recently decided by the Yoshida government to be renovated include Yokohama, Kobe, Kyoto, Nara and other places. The main contents of the five-year plan to build Yokohama into an "international port" are: laying 55,000 meters of important trunk roads and a large number of other roads, building airports and some new wharves specifically for foreign use, renovating a vast urban area of 2.5 million tsubo (one tsubo is equal to 3.3 square meters), building "international tourist hotels," etc. The total cost is about 4 billion yen, half of which will be collected from local residents in the form of municipal bonds and local taxes. The citizens of Yokohama will not only have to bear the huge "construction" costs, but 25 percent of them will be forced to relocate due to "urban renovation."

    吉田政府扩充日本港口供美帝利用
    【新华社二十七日讯】电通社马尼拉二十六日讯：至少有一名美国陆军高级军官，已于最近离此赴东京，参加麦克阿瑟的盟总谍报组组长威洛贝和前日本中将樱井的商谈。商谈的事项是在美国在远东或东南亚可能采取的任何军事行动中利用日本军队的问题。
    商谈将依据以樱井为首的一群日本前任高级军官向麦克阿瑟提出的建议草案进行，该草案的着重点是利用以前的日本兵士来执行美国的军事计划，特别是用来对付中国。
    樱井和其他将领建议在日本建立几支强有力的“志愿军”，由有在中国、缅甸和印度支那作战经验的以前的干部和官兵组成。樱井的建议指出：这些军队在经过特殊训练（包括伞兵的训练）以后，一旦对中华人民共和国进行军事行动时，可以用来帮助蒋介石。
    樱井建议的另一个要点是成立一些组织，指挥在中华人民共和国后方的破坏活动和恐怖活动。樱井认为这些组织中应当包含以前日本伞兵部队的干部和日本帝国空军的技术人员。
    威洛贝已受命与樱井合作，草拟一个以樱井建议为基础的明确计划，然后由麦克阿瑟送呈华盛顿国防部。
    【新华社二十七日讯】日本吉田政府正以建设“国际港”及“国际文化观光都市”为掩盖，将日本港口及内地都市军事基地化与殖民地化，以便利其美国主子利用。据联合通讯社讯：最近经吉田政府决定改造的港口及都市，有横滨、神户、京都、奈良等地。建设横滨为“国际港”的五年计划的主要内容是：铺设五万五千公尺的重要干线道路及大量其他道路，建筑飞机场及一部分专供外国使用的新码头，整理广达二百五十万坪（按一坪合三·三平方公尺）的市区，建造“国际观光旅馆”等。全部费用约四十余亿日元，其中半数将以市债，地方税等方式，向当地居民征收。横滨市民不仅要负担巨额“建设”费用，并且他们之中有百分之二十五将因“整理市区”而被迫迁移。
