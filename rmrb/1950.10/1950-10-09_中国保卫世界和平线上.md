　　In the Suide District of Shaanxi Province, a widespread peace signature campaign has been launched in various locations. Various venues such as mass rallies, mule and horse fairs, and market days were used to collect peace signatures. After vigorous promotion, the people in various villages and towns had a clear understanding of the peace signature campaign and signed their names voluntarily. Farmer Zheng Qingheng said when signing: "This American fellow is really bad to the core. He helped Chiang Kai-shek harm us for so many years, and now he wants to bully us ordinary people again. He is just asking for his own death." Through this peace signature campaign, everyone had a further understanding of the significance of opposing American imperialist aggression and defending world peace.

　　Yuan Shu'en, a 92-year-old former scholar from Yinan County, Shandong Province, had never attended a meeting before. This time, when he heard about signing to defend peace, he arrived at the meeting place early to wait for his turn to sign. Li Xiuji's wet nurse was 82 years old. When she heard that a peace signature rally was being held, she walked to the meeting place with crutches and said, "You young people step aside and let me sign my name."
　　(Sui Guangxun)

　　中国保卫世界和平线上
    陕西绥德分区所属各地广泛地展开了和平签名运动。各地利用了群众大会、骡马大会，集市等场合征集和平签名。经过大力宣传，各村镇人民对和平签名有了明确的认识，都纷纷自动签了名。农民郑清恒在签名时说：“美国这家伙，实在坏透了，帮蒋介石害了咱多少年，现在又想来欺侮咱们老百姓，真是自找死路。”每个人通过这次和平签名，对于反对美帝侵略、保卫世界和平的意义有了进一步的了解。

    山东沂南县九十二岁的老秀才苑树恩，从未参加过会议。这次听说签名保卫和平，很早就跑到会场等候签名。李秀吉的奶娘八十二岁了，听说开和平签名大会，柱着拐杖，走到会场说：“你们年青的闪开，让我签个名。”
