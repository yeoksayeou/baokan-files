Beijing Daoji Hospital Christians
    Respond to the Chinese Christian Manifesto
    [This newspaper's report] Regarding the publication of the manifesto by Chinese Christian circles, Christian individuals at Beijing Daoji Hospital issued the following written statement:
    "The Path of Effort for Chinese Christianity in the Construction of New China," this historically significant document, was gloriously published in the newspapers on the 23rd of last month.
    Indeed, as the document mentions: "In the hundred-odd years since Christianity was introduced to China, it has made considerable contributions to Chinese society, but unfortunately, not long after Christianity was introduced to China, imperialism began its activities in China, and Christianity became related to imperialism intentionally or unintentionally, visibly or invisibly," becoming a tool for imperialist aggression against China and changing the essence of Christianity.
    However, under the leadership of our wise Chairman Mao, the Christian churches and organizations of the People's Republic of China have clearly recognized the true face of imperialism, have awakened, and are determined to completely sever relations with it, avoiding being used by it again to carry out its divisive schemes, attempting to create counter-revolutionary forces, doing things that harm the interests of the people and the country, and hindering the construction of our new China. We absolutely stand on the position of Christians in the new China, dedicating our whole body and whole heart, and will fully promote the realization of the path of effort for Chinese Christianity in the future, building our independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous new China under the leadership of our infinitely powerful new government.

　　北京道济医院基督徒
    响应中国基督教宣言
    【本报讯】就中国基督教界发表宣言事，北京道济医院基督教人士发表书面意见如下：
    “中国基督教在新中国建设中努力的途径”这篇具有历史意义的文件，已于上月二十三日光荣地在报端发表了。
    的确，正如文件上所提：“基督教传到中国百余年中，对于中国的社会曾经有过相当的贡献，但不幸得很，基督教传到中国不久以后，帝国主义便在中国开始活动，基督教同帝国主义便在有意无意有形无形之中发生了关系”，成了帝国主义侵略中国的工具，改变了基督教的本质。
    然在我们英明的毛主席领导下之中华人民共和国的基督教教会及其团体，已很清楚的认识了帝国主义的真面目，已然觉悟起来，很坚决的彻底的与其断绝关系，避免再受其利用来进行它们挑拨离间之能事，企图制造反动力量之阴谋，做些危害人民国家利益的事情，阻碍我们新中国的建设。我们绝对站在新中国基督教徒之立场，奉献我们全身全心，在为中国基督教今后努力的途径中全力促其实现，在我们这有无限力量之新政府领导下建设我们的独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新中国。
