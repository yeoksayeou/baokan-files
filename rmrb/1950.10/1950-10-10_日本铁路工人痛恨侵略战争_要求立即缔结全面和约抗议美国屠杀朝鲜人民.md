　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 9th, TASS dispatch from Tokyo on the 5th: The Fourth District Branch of the Shinagawa Station (one of Tokyo's largest stations) of the Japan National Railway Workers' Union passed a resolution on September 27th, protesting the intensified exploitation of workers to transport military orders to Korea. This resolution has been forwarded to the United Nations General Assembly by the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

　　The resolution stated: "Since the mass layoffs of railway personnel in 1949, the exploitation of labor here has intensified. After the start of the Korean War, it has become even more severe. The current situation is the same as during wartime. We hate war and demand peace. Therefore, we demand the immediate conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty." The resolution declared "support for the Stockholm Appeal, which declares the government that first uses the atomic bomb to be a war criminal," and opposed the aggressors' massacre of the Korean people.

　　日本铁路工人痛恨侵略战争
    要求立即缔结全面和约抗议美国屠杀朝鲜人民
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社五日电引东京消息：日本国营铁道工会品川车站（东京最大车站之一）第四区支会，于九月二十七日通过一项决议，抗议为了运输军事订货到朝鲜去而加紧剥削工人。这项决议已由世界工会联合会书记处转给联合国大会。
    决议说：“自从一九四九年大批解雇铁道人员以来，此间便加紧剥削劳工。在朝鲜战争开始后，更形加剧。现在的情况和战时一样。我们痛恨战争，要求和平。因此我们要求立即缔结全面和约。”决议声明“拥护宣布首先使用原子弹的政府为战争罪犯的斯德哥尔摩宣言”，并反对侵略者屠杀朝鲜人民。
