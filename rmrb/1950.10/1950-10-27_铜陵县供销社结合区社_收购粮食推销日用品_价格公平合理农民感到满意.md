The Tongling County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Combines with District Cooperative:
    Purchases Grain and Promotes Daily Necessities
    Prices are Fair and Reasonable, Farmers are Satisfied

[Our Paper News] The Eighth District of Tongling County, Southern Anhui, was a severely affected disaster area last year. The masses were lacking in clothing and daily necessities, especially the poor farmers. This autumn, as the new rice came onto the market, the farmers were preparing to sell it to exchange for cloth and daily necessities. However, in the beginning, state-owned trading companies and cooperatives did not pay attention to purchasing, so private merchants suppressed the purchase price. While the company price was 1,000 yuan per catty of rice (old scale), private merchants lowered it to 700 yuan per catty (old scale). Also, the cooperative's selling price of salt in the area was equivalent to 2.4 catties of rice per catty of salt, while private merchants raised it to 2.8 catties of rice per catty of salt, causing widespread complaints among farmers. After learning about this situation, the Tongling County Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Office contacted the district cooperatives and purchased the new rice at market prices, appropriately increasing the prices. At the same time, they reduced the prices of daily necessities by 5 percent and supplied them to the farmers in large quantities. In the Liqiao Town purchasing station of the district alone, starting from the beginning of September, they purchased more than 144,000 catties of rice in six days, supplying farmers with more than 2,000 catties of sea salt, 140 feet of foreign cloth, 60 pots, as well as matches, cooking oil, and other items. This was an unprecedented phenomenon before the autumn harvest, indicating that the purchasing power of farmers has increased. At the same time, farmers are very satisfied with the cooperative's active role in solving their difficulties through regulatory work.

　　铜陵县供销社结合区社
    收购粮食推销日用品
    价格公平合理农民感到满意
    【本报讯】皖南铜陵县第八区去年属于重灾区，衣服、日用必需品等群众都很缺乏，特别是贫苦农民，今秋新稻上市，农民准备出卖后换些布匹和日用必需品。但开始时国营贸易公司与合作社皆未注意收购，因此私商便压价收购，公司牌价每市斤米合一千元，私商却压低到老秤一斤七百元；又当地合作社盐的卖价，每斤合米二斤四两，私商却抬高到每斤合米二斤十二两，农民普遍叫苦。铜陵县供销合作总社了解此情况后，即与区社取得联系，并按市价适当提高价格收购新稻，同时对日用必需品价格则减低百分之五，大量供应农民。仅该区犁桥镇一个收购站，九月初开始收购，六天中即收购稻子十四万四千余斤，供给农民海盐二千余斤，洋布一百四十余丈，锅六十余个，以及火柴、食油等。这是秋收前从未有过的现象。说明农民购买力已有提高。同时农民对合作社积极替他们解决困难的调剂工作都感到很满意。
