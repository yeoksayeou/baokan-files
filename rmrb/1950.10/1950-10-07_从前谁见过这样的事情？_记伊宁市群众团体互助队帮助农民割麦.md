　　"Who has ever seen such a thing before?"
    ——A record of the mutual aid teams of mass organizations in Yining City helping farmers harvest wheat
    Ge Li
    In mid-August, the wheat near Yining City ripened. Mass organizations in Yining City organized mutual aid teams to go to the countryside to help poor farmers harvest, achieving good results and demonstrating the enthusiasm of all ethnic groups for unity and mutual assistance.
  I. Eager Participation in Mutual Aid Teams
    The Yining City New Democratic Youth League first mobilized more than sixty league members staying in the city during the summer vacation to form a mutual aid work team, deciding to use Sundays to go to the countryside to help farmers harvest. At the mobilization meeting, more than sixty male and female league members of all ethnic groups unanimously proposed the slogan "Do not violate mass discipline; bring your own sickles, boiled water, and dry rations; do not drink a drop of the people's water, do not eat a single *nang* (馍馍) of the people." Toktomeh said: "If we don't have sickles, we will pull it out by hand; if we don't have dry rations, we will go hungry to complete the task."
    This news reached the Women's Federation. The director of the Women's Federation, Hanipan, immediately convened a general meeting of all members, soliciting everyone's opinion: Are you willing to help poor farmers harvest? More than thirty women members present said: "Helping poor farmers is the most glorious thing, why wouldn't we be willing?" The next day, more than fifty women signed up.
    Most of the comrades of the Farmers' Association had already gone to the countryside to work. Several cadres left at home for office work publicized in the streets and lanes, mobilizing the masses to also participate in this movement. Wu Aier, who was blind, also requested to sign up. He shouted: "Although my eyes can't see and I can't hold a sickle, I can boil water for everyone. I must participate!" As soon as he finished speaking, more than a dozen people signed up; seven people voluntarily lent out their own sickles. Twelve-year-old Nylan Ahemanet, a female student at the Russian school, also wanted to sign up, but because she was too young, everyone advised her not to go. She said: "I can't harvest wheat, but I can fetch boiled water for everyone!"
  II. Happily heading towards the wheat fields
    It was a morning in mid-August. The east was just showing a fish-belly color, and the whole earth was still quietly sleeping; in the streets and lanes of Yining City, many figures were already shaking. They were all carrying sickles, carrying dry rations, and some women were still holding children, walking from various different corners towards one place, converging into a huge crowd.
    When the sun just poked its head out from the eastern horizon, this team began to move out.
    The red league flag fluttered in the morning breeze at the very front of the crowd; more than sixty male and female youth league members of all ethnic groups, under the large red cloth banner written in both Uyghur and Han characters "Yining City New Democratic Youth League Mutual Aid Work Team", closely followed the league flag forward.
    Under the red cloth banner written in Uyghur script were the women's chaotic ranks. Wu Mela Khan, the vice director of the Women's Federation, vigorously pulled the accordion; Hanipan, the seventy-three-year-old director of the Women's Federation, walked and danced the "folk dance"; many women stepped to the rhythm of the accordion, dancing and walking forward. Gu Somet Khan, who was in her sixties, held an old "guitar," walking, playing, and singing.
    "Why are you so happy?"
    "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we have been liberated; helping poor farmers harvest, participating in labor is glorious, it is right, why shouldn't I be happy?!"
    Amu Khan struggled to hold her daughter, falling behind the team.
    Alifu drove his cart, pulling his children and wife, sandwiched in the middle of the crowd, with the children climbing all over the carriage. He said: "Yesterday I heard that the women were going to the countryside to help poor farmers harvest wheat, which made me so happy. I fixed my car at night, and today I brought my wife to participate together. I absolutely support helping the working people."
    The Uyghur girls, who usually do not go out much, also came to participate in the labor with their mothers and sisters-in-law today, wearing beautiful floral shirts.
  III. "Passing a stop too quickly"
    The vanguard stopped beside Alifu's wheat field. There were only three *hu* (each *hu* being 270 jin of wheat) here, and seventeen *hu* were in Chenpanzi, more than ten *li* away from here. They discussed: "Should we harvest this small piece here first, and then go to harvest the large piece in front? Or should we harvest the piece in front first, and then come back to harvest this one?" The league flag leaned against an elm tree.
    The women's team came. They only asked one sentence: "Is this the wheat we are going to harvest?" and then started working. Children, clothes, dry rations, and melons and fruits were piled on the edge of the ground. They surrounded a wheat field with an area of two *hu* one by one from all sides. As the sickle waved, the singing rippled. The golden wheat fell down piece by piece, gradually shrinking from all sides to the center.
    The young people also started harvesting in another field, and laughter, shouts, and singing resounded in one piece. They and they were secretly holding an undeclared competition. The sun was as hot as fire, sweat flowed from everyone's face, and the sweat soaked through their clothes. But no one wanted to stop for a moment. This kept the comrades of the film team busy, they had to take care of this side and that side, and there were moving shots everywhere.
    "Finished harvesting, let's move forward!" someone shouted.
    Everyone felt like it had just started, and three *hu* of land had been harvested. This was simply "passing a stop too quickly!" No one wanted to rest, and they started moving forward again.
  IV. Dancing instead of resting
    The team was completely chaotic. The league flag had long been fluttering in the wind at the entrance of Chenpanzi Village, more than ten *li* away, while some league members were still walking far behind the crowd. The "guitar", accordion, and singing resounded through the fields again. The breeze was blowing on the pieces of golden wheat fields, as if bowing to them and smiling, welcoming them to harvest.
    The team converged in a shady grove of trees in Chenpanzi, where they would rest for half an hour. Wu Mela Khan hadn't even sat down yet, so she opened her accordion, and the crowd immediately gathered around and sat in a large circle. Zao Er Khan, seventy-eight years old, and Gu Somet Khan, who was in her sixties, two Uyghur old women, immediately started dancing against each other. They danced and sang, winning constant cheers and applause from the audience.
    Akichi Khan came on stage, an old Uyghur woman in her seventies with a wrinkled face. Her family was so poor that she had nothing, and she relied on her son to make a living. She said while dancing: "Now the government is our own government, laboring is for our own sake, and we will participate in labor more and more in the future."
    Most of the women danced, expressing their joy in loving labor. Many league members were resting in another way: some of them were twisting ropes for bundling wheat; some were holding critique meetings; some were sharpening their sickles.
    The half-hour rest time passed happily, and everyone automatically walked to the wheat field. The singing in the wheat field rippled again. But the singing quickly fell silent, and everyone was just busy working, and only the rustling sound of harvesting wheat could be heard in the wheat field.
  V. Laboring Courageously
    Women member Ma Lanmu took off her high heels, barefooted, and vigorously cut the wheat with her head down. She had more than a dozen wounds on her feet from being pierced by wheat straw, but she didn't care at all. She said: "I don't feel the pain. Helping the poor to work, what does it matter if I suffer a little pain?"
    Ruoha Mu Khan, a fifty-eight-year-old Uyghur woman, rolled up her floral shirt to her waist, her face was covered with sweat, and her body was completely wet, but she didn't even bother to wipe it, and she cut forward without looking back.
    If Mina, a young female league member, had never participated in labor before. Today, she was wearing a white nursing uniform, and the iron sickle in her hand kept waving. She never rested.
    Gelowushekong's right hand was crippled during the revolutionary era in the three districts (Tacheng, Ashan, and Ili). He used his left hand to cut the wheat. He cut eight wounds on his hand, and the blood dyed the sickle red, but he did not stop working.
    Mahamut, the dean of the Ili Disabled Soldiers' Rehabilitation Institute, also came to the field on horseback. One of his legs was broken by an enemy shell during the revolution in the three districts. He used crutches to tie up the wheat, jumping and hobbling around busily. The hot sun made his fat body sweat profusely. But he never stopped either.
    Three young Hui female league members—innocent and lively little girls—quietly bundled up the scattered wheat on the ground, handful by handful, while everyone else was only focused on cutting wheat with their heads down; they also carefully picked up the cut wheat ears one by one. No one noticed that they had done these things. The three of them wore worker hats on their heads, and their little faces were red from the sun, making them even more lovely. They didn't know fatigue, and they didn't know how to rest.
    The paramedic carried a medicine bag, following behind everyone. Whoever cut their hand or bruised their foot, he would apply medicine and bandage them. However, when the work was tense, no one wanted to stop working to find the paramedic because they had a cut on their hand or a bruise on their foot. The paramedic's work became less and less. Finally, he put down the medicine bag, found a sickle, and started cutting too.
    The weather was too hot, it is said that this was the first time it was so hot this year. Because everyone was cutting so hard, many people were unable to support it, but no one wanted to rest. They occasionally jumped into the canal to take a bath, and then continued to cut. Alam Khan didn't even bother to take a bath, she just kept cutting with her head down. Her body was not good enough at ordinary times. When the work was successfully completed, when the last handful of wheat was cut in her hand, she fainted. Everyone poured water on her to wake her up. She said: "It doesn't matter, I'll be fine after a rest."
  VI. The host families are troubled
    When the crowds of wheat cutters poured into the wheat fields of Abudula and Mahamuti, the two owners were panicked. They had never heard of such a good thing. They didn't know what to bring to entertain these guests. They heard that these people came to cut wheat, brought their own dry rations, only did work, and didn't eat or drink. Now these people came to their land to cut wheat, and it was exactly as the previous rumors said. This made them embarrassed. The guests did not accept any rewards or hospitality, and they felt sorry for themselves. They were just grateful in their hearts and couldn't say a word. After thirteen *hu* of wheat was harvested, Abudula and Mahamuti said sincerely: "If we hired people to cut it ourselves, I'm afraid the harvested wheat wouldn't be enough for the wages..."
    On the way home, eight women including Aji Gu Kao, Nu Khan, Ha Li Ai Khan, Han Kesi, Mi Lian Mu Sha Khan, and Er Khan walked with sweat on their faces, panting so hard that they couldn't even speak, and hurriedly ran to the brigade. It turned out that they got up a little late in the morning, and arrived at the designated meeting place at 6:30, but they could no longer find the team, so they ran around looking for them. They said very ashamed and uneasy: "We walked nearly 120 *li* of road, walked to Suiding (60 *li* from Yining) and walked back, but we couldn't find our people. We didn't want to go back, and we always felt unwilling if we couldn't find you. But it's too late to find you."
    Such action is the first time in the history of Ili. When the tired crowd of people returning victoriously walked into the streets of Yining, men, women, old and young, from every household ran out of the gate to see them. The children followed the team for a long distance out of curiosity. People said with surprise and admiration: "Who has ever seen such a thing before?!"

　　“从前谁见过这样的事情？”
    ——记伊宁市群众团体互助队帮助农民割麦
    歌黎
    八月中旬，伊宁市附近的麦子成熟了。伊市各群众团体都组织了互助队，下乡帮助贫苦农民收割，得到了很好的成绩，表现了各族人民团结互助的热情。
  一、踊跃参加互助队
    伊宁市新民主主义青年团，首先发动了暑假中留在本市的六十多个团员，组织了互助工作队，决定利用星期日下乡帮助农民收割。在动员会上，六十多个各族男女团员一致提出“不违犯群众纪律；自备镰刀、开水、干粮，不喝老百姓一口水，不吃老百姓一个馕（馍馍）”的口号。脱克脱米希说：“没有镰刀就用手拔；没有干粮饿肚子也要完成任务。”
    这一个消息传到了妇联会。妇联会主任哈尼畔，马上召集了全体会员大会，征求大家意见：愿不愿意帮助贫苦农民收割？到会的三十多个妇女会员表示：“帮助贫苦农民是最光荣的事情，为啥不愿意？”第二天就有五十多个妇女报了名。
    农会的同志大部分已下乡工作，留家办公的几个干部，就在各街巷宣传，动员群众也参加这一运动。双目失明的吾爱尔，亦要求报名参加。他喊着说：“我的眼睛虽然看不见，抓不住镰刀，可是我能给大家架火烧开水喝。我一定参加！”他的话刚一说完，接着就有十几个人报了名；七个人自动借出了自己的镰刀。十二岁的娜依兰阿哈曼特，这个俄罗斯族学校的女生也要报名，因为她年纪太小，大家劝她不要去。她说：“我割不了麦子，我可以给大家提开水呀！”
  二、愉快地奔向麦田
    这是八月中旬的一个早晨。东方刚呈现鱼肚色，整个大地还在静静地沉睡中；伊宁市的各个街巷里已晃动着不少的人影。他（她）们都挟着镰刀，提着干粮，有的妇女还抱着孩子，从各个不同的角落，向着一个地方走来，汇合成一个庞大的人群。
    太阳刚从东方天边探出头来的时候，这支队伍就开始出动了。
    红色的团旗迎着晨风，在人群的最前面招展着；六十多个各民族的男女青年团员，在用维、汉两种文字写着“伊宁市新民主主义青年团互助工作队”的大红布标语下，紧紧地跟着团旗前进。
    写着维吾尔文字的红布标语下，是妇女们杂乱的行列。妇联副主任吾买拉汗，用力地拉着手风琴；七十三岁的妇联主任哈尼畔，边走边跳着“土风舞”；许多妇女都踏着手风琴的音拍，一面舞一面向前走。六十多岁的古索木汗，抱着个破旧的“吉塔”，一边走，一边弹，一边唱。
    “你为啥这样高兴？”
    “在共产党领导下，我们获得了解放；帮助穷苦农民收割，参加劳动是光荣的，应该的，我为啥不高兴？！”
    阿木汗吃力地抱着她的女儿，掉在队伍的后面。
    阿力甫红赶着他的大车，拉着他的孩子和老婆，夹在人群中间，小孩子爬满了车厢。他说：“我昨天听说妇女们要下乡帮助贫苦农民割麦，这使我太高兴了。我在夜里把我的车修好，今天拉着我的老婆一同来参加。帮助劳动人民，我是绝对拥护的。”
    平常不大出门的维族姑娘们，今天穿着漂亮的花衫子，也跟着妈妈，嫂嫂来参加劳动。
  三、“打了一个过站”
    在阿鲁甫的麦田旁，先锋队伍停留下来了。这儿只有三戽（每戽二百七十斤小麦），还有十七戽在距这儿十华里以外的陈盘子。他们商量着：“是先割了这儿的一小块，再到前面去割那一大块呢？还是先割了前面的那一块，回来再割这儿的呢？”团旗靠在一棵榆树上。
    妇女们的队伍来了。她们只问了一句：“这麦子是不是我们要割的？”就动起手来了。小孩、衣服、干粮、瓜果都堆放在地边。她们一个挨一个地把一块两戽面积的麦田从四周包围了。随着镰刀的挥动，歌声就荡漾起来了。金黄色的麦子，一把一把的倒下来，从四周向中心逐渐地缩小着。
    青年们在另一块地里也割开了，笑声、叫声、歌声响成一片。他们和她们暗暗地在举行着没有宣布的竞赛。太阳像火一样热，汗水从每个人的脸上流下来，身上的汗浸透了衣衫。可是谁也不愿意稍停一停。这可忙坏了电影队的摄影同志，他们顾了这面，又要顾那面，到处都是动人的镜头。
    “割完了，再往前走吧！”有人这样喊着。
    大家都觉得好像刚刚开始，三戽地就割完了。这简直是“打了个过站！”谁也不愿意休息，又开始向前行进了。
  四、舞蹈代替休息
    队伍完全混乱了。团旗早就在十里以外的陈盘子庄口上迎风飘动，而一部分团员们却还远远地走在人群的后面。“吉塔”、手风琴和歌唱声又响彻了田野。微风吹着一块块金黄色的麦田，好像在向他（她）们低头微笑，在欢迎着他（她）们来收割。
    队伍在陈盘子一块浓荫的树林里会合了，在这里要休息半个钟头。吾买拉汗还没有坐下来，就拉开了她的手风琴，人群马上围拢来，坐了一个大圆圈。七十八岁的皂尔汗和六十多岁的古索木汗两个维族老婆子，紧接着开始对舞了。她们连舞带唱，博得观众不断地喝彩和鼓掌。
    阿克其汗出场了，这是一位七十多岁满脸皱纹的维族老太婆。她家里穷得什么也没有，只靠着一个儿子过活。她一面舞一面说：“现在政府是我们自己的政府，劳动是给我们自己劳动，我们以后要更多多地参加劳动。”
    妇女们大部分都跳了舞，表示出她们热爱劳动的快乐。不少团员们都用另外一种方式休息着：他（她）们中一部分在纽着捆麦子的索子；一部分在开检讨会；一部分在磨着镰刀。
    半点钟的休息时间愉快地过去了，大家都自动地向麦田走去。麦田里的歌声随着又动荡起来了。但歌声很快就沉默了下来，大家只顾紧张地工作，麦田里只听得一片沙沙的割麦声。
  五、奋勇劳动
    妇女会员马兰木，脱下了她的高跟鞋，光着脚片子，低着头一鼓劲地在割，脚上被麦秸戮破了十几处伤，她一点也不在乎。她说：“我不觉得伤痛。帮助穷人劳动，自己受一点痛苦算得了什么？”
    五十八岁的维族妇女若哈木汗，把她的花衫子卷到腰干上，脸上流着汗，身子全湿透了，她连擦一下都顾不得，头也不回地向前割去。
    女青年团员若密娜，过去从来没有参加过劳动，今天她穿着一件白色的看护服，手里的铁镰不住的挥舞着，她始终没有休息过。
    哥老吾什孔的右手，在三区（塔城、阿山、伊犁）革命时代残废了，他就用左手来割。手上割了八条伤口，血染红了镰刀，但是他并没有停止工作。
    伊犁残废军人教养院的院长马哈木提，也骑着马来到了地里。他的一只腿在三区革命时代被敌人的炮弹打断了，拄着拐棍捆绑麦子，跳过来、拐过去地忙碌着。肥大的身躯被火热的太阳晒得热汗直流。但他也始终没有停歇。
    三个回族女青年团员——天真活泼的小姑娘，在大家伙只顾低着头割麦的当儿，一声不响地把散放满地的麦子，一把一把地捆起来；被割掉的麦穗，她们也细心地一穗穗地拣拾干净。她们做好了这些事情，割麦的人都没有注意。三个人每人头上戴了一顶工人帽，小脸蛋被太阳晒得红红的，更显得可爱。她们不知道疲累，也不知道休息。
    救护员背着药包，跟在大家后面。谁割破了手或碰破了脚，他就给涂上药水，扎好纱布。可是，在工作紧张的时候，谁都不愿意因为手上割了一条口子或脚上碰破了皮而停止工作去找救护员。救护员的工作越来越少了。最后，他放下了药包，找了把镰刀也割起来了。
    天气太热了，据说这是今年第一次这样热。因为大家割得太猛，很多人都有些支持不住了，但谁也不愿意就休息。他（她）们不时跳到河渠里洗一下澡，出来又接着割了起来。阿拉木汗连澡也顾不得洗，只是低着头不住地割着。她的身体平时就不够好，当工作胜利的完成，最后的一把麦子割在她手里的时候，她晕过去了。大家用水把她浇醒来。她说：“没有关系，休息一下就好了。”
  六、主人家作难了
    当割麦的人群涌进阿不都拉和麻哈木提的麦地里时，使两个主人慌张了。他们从来就没有听说过这样好的事情。他们不知道拿些什么东西来招待这些客人。他们听说：这些人来割麦，自己带着干粮，只给干活儿，不吃不喝。现在这些人到自己的地里割麦来了，而且和以前听到的传说一点也不错。这可使他们为了难。客人不接受任何报偿和招待，自己又过意不去。只是感激在心里，一句话也说不出来。十三戽麦子割完了，阿不都拉和麻哈木提衷心感激地说：“要是我们自己雇人割，恐怕收的麦子还不够工钱……”
    在回家的路上，阿吉古考、奴汗、哈力艾汗、罕克斯、米连木沙汗、尔汗等八个妇女，走得满头大汗，气喘得连话都说不上来，匆忙地向大队跑来。原来她们早上起得迟了些，六点半钟到了规定的集合地点，但已经找不见队伍了，于是就跑到各处找寻。她们非常惭愧和不安地说：“我们走了将近一百二十里路，走到绥定（距伊宁六十里）又走回来，怎么也找不见我们的人。我们又不愿意回去，找不到你们心里总觉得不甘休。可是找到了又迟了。”
    这样的行动，在伊犁的历史上是头一遭。当胜利归来的人群疲倦地走进伊宁街头时，各家各户的男女老少都跑出大门来看望。小孩子们更好奇地跟着队伍走了很远。人们带着惊奇赞叹的口气说：“从前谁见过这样的事情？！”
        一九五○、九、七、伊宁。
