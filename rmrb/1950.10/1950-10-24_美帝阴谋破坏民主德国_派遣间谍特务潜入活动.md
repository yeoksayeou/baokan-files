Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 19th (TASS): The spy agencies of Western imperialist countries are dispatching spies and saboteurs to the German Democratic Republic in an attempt to obstruct the peaceful and democratic development of the country.

Regarding this, West German newspapers have published reports of several sabotage activities that have been uncovered. For example, recently in a small town called Hilfa in the district of Orff, a saboteur who fired two shots was arrested. During interrogation, he confessed that he received 300 Marks from the American spy agency for each shot he fired. Another saboteur who carried out despicable sabotage activities on a state-owned farm in the Weimar district confessed after being arrested by the People's Police that he had fed livestock with poison prepared to kill potato beetles on the farm. Another saboteur in a candy factory attempted to make the factory unable to work by stuffing machines with nuts, screws, and other things, but was uncovered in time thanks to the vigilance of the workers. In Leipzig, the People's Police arrested a spy who, on the orders of the United States, incited members of the Free German Youth League to leave the German Democratic Republic. In Naumburg, a spy was discovered who attempted to recruit people in the German Democratic Republic to train at West German spy schools.

These examples illustrate that the enemies of the German Democratic Republic are resorting to the most despicable means to endanger and hinder the further development of the Republic. However, the cracking of these enemy crimes proves that raising the people's vigilance can shatter all the evil plans of the American and British imperialists and their Bonn Quislings.

　　美帝阴谋破坏民主德国
    派遣间谍特务潜入活动
   【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社柏林十九日讯：西方帝国主义国家的间谍机关，派遣间谍和阴谋破坏者到德意志民主共和国，企图阻碍该国和平民主的发展。
   关于这一点，西德报纸刊载了若干已被破获了的阴谋破坏行为。如最近在欧法特县中一个叫做希尔法的小镇里，曾拘捕了一个放了两枪的阴谋破坏者。审讯时，他供认他每打一枪便可在美国间谍机关领得三百马克。另一个在魏马县的国营农场中进行卑鄙的破坏活动的阴谋破坏者，在被人民警察拘捕后供称，他把该农场配制成杀马铃薯甲虫的毒药投给牲畜吃。另一个糖果厂的阴谋破坏者以硬壳果和螺丝钉等物塞入机器中，企图使该工厂无法工作，但在工人的警惕下被及时揭发了。在莱比锡，人民警察拘捕了一个间谍，他奉美国的训令，挑唆自由德国青年联盟的工作人员离开德意志民主共和国。在脑堡，发现了一个间谍，他企图在德意志民主共和国招募人员到西德间谍学校去受训。
   这些例证说明，德意志民主共和国的敌人正不惜利用最卑劣的手段，来危害和阻碍共和国进一步的发展。然而破获这些敌人罪行的事情证明：人民提高警惕性，就可以粉碎美英帝国主义者及其波恩吉斯林分子的一切罪恶计划。
