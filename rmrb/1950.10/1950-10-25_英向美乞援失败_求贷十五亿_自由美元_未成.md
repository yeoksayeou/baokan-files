　　Britain's Plea to the U.S. for Aid Fails
    Request for $1.5 Billion "Free Dollars" Denied

    Xinhua News Agency, 24th. Former British Economic Affairs Minister Gaitskell traveled to Washington on the 11th of this month to beg the U.S. government for dollars to solve Britain's financial difficulties in rearming. However, after several days of informal negotiations, he failed to achieve his goal and had to fly back to London in haste on the 20th to succeed the recently resigned Cripps as Chancellor of the Exchequer, a position fraught with difficulties.

    Gaitskell's trip to Washington was to request that the United States provide Britain with $1.5 billion in "free dollars" that Britain could use at its discretion. However, according to the Associated Press, when Gaitskell arrived in the United States, the State Department notified Britain that the dollars the United States might allocate to Britain "could only be used to purchase raw materials and equipment specifically needed to increase military production." At the same time, the United States considered Britain's request for $1.5 billion in "free dollars" to be "unjustified." Furthermore, according to Agence France-Presse in Washington, the United States merely "agreed to lend Britain $700 million" "to purchase raw materials and machine tools in the United States." Although this sum can provide some subsidies to British arms production, it does nothing to alleviate Britain's urgent financial difficulties. In a speech delivered upon arriving at London Airport on the 20th, Gaitskell also expressed great difficulty in how to implement the U.S. military expansion plan without further plunging the British economy into crisis. He said: "The pressure to increase wages is urgent, and soaring raw material prices make it difficult to control British prices even with subsidies."

### 英向美乞援失败  求贷十五亿“自由美元”未成

　　英向美乞援失败
    求贷十五亿“自由美元”未成
    【新华社二十四日讯】原任英国经济事务大臣贾兹克尔，曾于本月十一日赴华盛顿向美国政府乞求美元，以解决英国在重整军备方面的财政困难，但经多日非正式谈判后，并未能达到目的，因此只得于二十日匆匆飞返伦敦，继最近辞职的克利浦斯而接任其困难的财政大臣职位。
    贾兹克尔这次华盛顿之行，是为要求美国供给英国以可由英国任意使用的十五亿“自由美元”，但据美联社称：当贾兹克尔抵美时，美国国务院即通知英国：美国可能拨予英国的美元，“只能用来购买为提高军事物资产量所特别需要的原料和装备”。同时美国认为英国关于十五亿“自由美元”的要求“是没有正当理由的”。另据法新社华盛顿消息：美国仅仅“答应贷予英国七亿美元”，“用以在美购买原料和工作母机”。这笔款项虽然能给英国军火生产方面以一些贴补，但是丝毫不能改善英国急迫的财政困难。贾兹克尔于二十日抵达伦敦机场时发表的谈话中，对于如何执行美国的扩军计划而又不使英国经济进一步陷入危机也表示十分为难。他说：“要求增加工资的压力是紧迫的，正在飞腾的原料价格使得甚至用津贴的办法来控制英国物价，也会感到困难。”
