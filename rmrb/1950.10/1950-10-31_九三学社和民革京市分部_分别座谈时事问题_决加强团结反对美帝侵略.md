The Jiu San Society and the Beijing Municipal Branch of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee
	Hold Separate Symposiums on Current Affairs
	Resolving to Strengthen Unity and Oppose American Imperialist Aggression
[Report from this newspaper] The Jiu San Society, in order to oppose American imperialism's expansion of aggression, specifically convened a symposium on July 27th. More than 30 members, including Tang Zaozhen, attended, chaired by Chairman Xu Deheng. Everyone was filled with righteous indignation and spoke enthusiastically. The opinions of those who spoke at the symposium were as follows:

(1) American imperialism's invasion of Korea is a concrete manifestation of its aggression against the entire world. It wants to emulate the Japanese imperialists after the Sino-Japanese War, using Korea as a springboard to invade Northeast China, invade all of China, and then annex the entire world. However, the democratic forces of the world will definitely unite to shatter the conspiracy of American imperialism. The democratic forces of Korea are a link in the democratic forces of the world. The success or failure of the Korean brothers is closely related to the democratic forces of the world. Especially because Korea is adjacent to our Northeast border, the relationship is as close as lips and teeth. Now, American imperialism has crossed the 38th parallel and is forcing its way north step by step, already reaching the edge of our Northeast. This not only shows its attempt to eliminate the democratic forces of Korea, but also directly threatens our survival. The current stage of the American imperialist war of aggression against Korea is already more directly related to our vital interests. Not only has the time come when we "cannot ignore it," but we should quickly manage it, manage it forcefully, and manage it effectively.

(2) In order to make a desperate struggle, American imperialism, in addition to frantically invading Korea and invading Taiwan, is now actively arming the reactionary factions of West Germany and Japan, actively making military deployments in the Middle East, and is about to directly use force to invade Vietnam. This shows that American imperialism intends to adopt a situation of blockade and encirclement against our peaceful and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, in order to deploy its dreamed-of global war of aggression. Our peaceful and democratic camp certainly loves peace, but when it reaches the point of unbearable tolerance, we should respond to actions with actions, and give blows to those who strike.

(3) Comrades of the Jiu San Society serve in the cultural and educational circles. Now, when national affairs are extremely tense, in addition to standing at our own posts, working hard, and exposing the deceptive words and deeds of American imperialism's disguise of democracy as much as possible, we must make even greater efforts to strengthen unity and unite around Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. With millionfold confidence, we trust our beloved Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, which works for the interests of the Chinese people, and respond to their great call to struggle forward.

[Report from this newspaper] The Beijing Municipal Branch of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee convened a symposium on the "Korean Question" for all party members in the city on the afternoon of October 24th. Speakers at the meeting all believed that American imperialism had already fallen into the quagmire of war by invading Korea, and if it dares to continue its aggression, it will only accelerate its own demise. We want peace and strive for peace, but we are also fully prepared and have the strength and confidence to eliminate the invaders. We are ready at any time to give the invaders a heavy blow in order to obtain true peace. Our democratic parties must further unite the masses and strive for a decisive victory.

　　九三学社和民革京市分部
    分别座谈时事问题
    决加强团结反对美帝侵略
    【本报讯】九三学社为反对美帝扩大侵略，特于七月二十七日召开座谈会，到社员汤璪真等三十余人，由许德珩主席。大家都义愤填胸，踊跃发言。座谈者的意见认为：
    （一）美帝侵略朝鲜，是他侵略整个世界的具体表现。他想效法甲午以后的日本帝国主义者，即以朝鲜为跳板，侵略东北、侵略全中国，进而并吞全世界。但是全世界的民主力量，必定团结一致以粉碎美帝的阴谋。朝鲜的民主力量，是全世界民主力量的一环，朝鲜兄弟力量的成败，和全世界民主力量痛切相关。尤其因为朝鲜和我们东北疆界毗连，更是唇齿相依。现在美帝超越“三八”线步步北迫，已经进到我东北边缘。这不但显示他企图消灭朝鲜的民主力量，同时更是直接威胁我们的生存。现阶段的美帝侵朝战争，已经对我们更具有利害切肤的关系了，我们现在不惟是已经到了“不能置之不理”的时候，而且应当赶快的理，有力的理，有效的理。
    （二）美帝为作垂死挣扎，除疯狂侵略朝鲜，侵略台湾外，近更积极武装西德和日本反动派，在中东积极作军事布置，并要直接用武力侵略越南，这显示着美帝对于我们以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，企图采取封锁包围的形势，借以布置他所梦想的世界全面侵略战争。我们和平民主阵营，固然热爱和平，但到忍无可忍的时候，我们应当以行动答复行动，予打击者以打击。
    （三）九三学社同人服务文教界，现当国事万分紧张的时候，除了站在自己的岗位上，努力工作，尽量揭破美帝伪装民主的欺骗言行外，我们更要加倍努力，加强团结，团结在毛主席和中国共产党的周围。我们以百万分的信心，信赖我们敬爱的毛主席及为中国人民谋利益的中国共产党，并响应他们伟大的号召，奋斗前进。
    【本报讯】民革北京市分部在十月二十四日午后，召集全市党员举行“朝鲜问题”座谈会。席间发言者都认为美帝侵略朝鲜，即已陷入战争泥沼，如再敢继续侵略，更系自找加速灭亡。我们要和平，争取和平，但也有充分准备，有消灭侵略者的力量和信心，我们随时准备给侵略者以惨重的打击，以获得真正的和平。我们民主党派，更要团结群众，争取决定性的胜利。
