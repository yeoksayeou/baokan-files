The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League
Holds Lecture Meeting of Combat Heroes
Revolutionary University of China, Peking University, and Other Schools Invite Model Workers to Give Reports
[Our Newspaper] Following the conclusion of the National Congress of Heroes and Model Workers, combat heroes from the People's Liberation Army and model workers from the broad masses of the working people have been giving reports to all sectors of youth in Beijing in recent days, receiving warm welcome and respect from the youth of Beijing.
The Beijing Municipal Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, on the afternoon of the 5th, invited 30 combat heroes who attended the National Congress of Combat Heroes Representatives, including Liu Sihu, Liu Zilin, Chai Xuejiu, Tian Guangwen, Li Landing, Liu Kuiji, Guo Junqing, Tu Xun, etc., to speak at ten venues to a total of 32,000 middle school students, young workers in private factories, office workers, and school teachers in the city. The invited combat heroes were warmly welcomed and respected by the audiences. Young people presented flowers, gifts, and letters of appreciation to the heroes and expressed their determination to learn from the combat heroes and strive for the cause of building the motherland.
The entire faculty and staff of North China People's Revolutionary University, Foreign Languages ​​School, and Labor University Diplomatic Training Class, after inviting four combat hero representatives to give reports at the school, welcomed the arrival of model worker representatives Zhang Shuyi, Li Yong, Zhao Guilan, Liang Jun, and Li Jinghua with extremely warm and excited emotions. Disabled soldier model Zhang Shuyi used simple language to narrate his exemplary deeds from combat to production. The deep class hatred and class love that ran through the entire story deeply moved all listeners. Li Yong, the driver of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, and Zhao Guilan, the model of factory protection, typically explained in their reports how the new Chinese male and female workers, with a high degree of class consciousness, loyally protect locomotives and factories with their lives. The deeds of Liang Jun, the first female tractor driver in New China, are an excellent example of working people learning technology and mastering technology. The report of Li Jinghua, the train conductor of the "Masses" train, showed that only a working attitude of wholeheartedly serving the people can win the praise of the people. The reports of the model workers were a vivid and concrete major lesson, and all faculty and staff expressed their gratitude and respect with献旗(presenting banners),献花(presenting flowers) and 献礼(presenting gifts).
Around 4:00 p.m. on the afternoon of the 2nd, more than 2,000 students from Peking University, Fu Jen Catholic University, Beijing Institute of Technology, and other schools welcomed Zhao Guilan and Zhao Naibin to give speeches at the Democracy Square venue.
Zhao Naibin is an engineer from Tangshan Steel Plant. He reported to the students all his unfortunate experiences in the old society after graduating from university, constantly feeling the oppression of life and the pain of unemployment. After liberation, thanks to the cultivation and education of the Communist Party, he accepted the leadership and assistance of the Party and the administration in his work. He first discarded the arrogance of intellectuals and intimately integrated with the masses, enabling him to fully exert his abilities and complete the production tasks assigned to them by the People's Government. His speech was warmly welcomed by the students.
Amidst lasting applause, Zhao Guilan walked to the loudspeaker and reported how she loved the property of the motherland and the people, and how she was injured four times in order to protect the safety of the factory. Then she said: "When the interests of the Party and the people conflict with personal interests, one should unhesitatingly obey the interests of the Party and sacrifice personal interests."
After the speech, they received flowers from the students amidst warm applause and cheers.
After the meeting, the two model worker representatives visited Chairman Mao's studio at the school and the Li Dazhao Memorial Room. They also accepted the request of the comrades managing the room and wrote inscriptions for Chairman Mao's studio at the school.

    【本报讯】全国英雄模范两代表会议闭幕后，来自人民解放军和广大劳动人民中的战斗英雄与劳动模范代表们，连日向北京各界青年作报告，受到北京各界青年热烈的欢迎和敬意。
    新民主主义青年团北京市工作委员会，在五日下午邀请出席全国战斗英雄代表会议的刘四虎、刘子林、柴学久、田广文、李蓝丁、刘奎基、郭俊卿、涂勋等三十位战斗英雄，分别在十个会场向全市中学生及私营工厂青年工人、机关职员、学校教员共三万二千人讲话。应邀讲演的战斗英雄们，受到与会听众的热烈欢迎与敬爱。青年们纷纷向英雄们献花，献礼，送慰问信；并表示一定要向战斗英雄学习，为建设祖国的事业而奋斗。
    华北人民革命大学，外国语学校和劳大外交训练班三校全体学工人员，继邀请四位战斗英雄代表来校报告之后，又以极为热烈兴奋的情绪，欢迎了劳动模范代表张树义、李永、赵桂兰、梁军、李静华五人的莅临。荣军模范张树义以朴实的语言，叙述了由战斗到生产的模范事迹。整个事迹中贯穿着的高度的阶级仇恨与阶级友爱，使全体听讲者深为感动。毛泽东号机车长李永和护厂模范赵桂兰，在报告中典型地说明了具有高度阶级觉悟的新中国男女工人们，是如何忠诚地用自己的生命爱护机车和工厂。新中国第一个女拖拉机手梁军的事迹，是劳动人民学习技术到掌握技术的优秀范例。群众号列车长李静华的报告，则说明了只有全心全意为人民服务的工作态度，才能赢得人民的称赞。劳模们的报告是一堂生动而又具体的大课，全体学工人员以献旗、献花和献礼表示了感谢与敬意。
    二日下午四点钟左右，北大、辅大、高工等校同学二千余人，欢迎赵桂兰和赵乃斌到民主广场会场演讲。
    赵乃斌是唐山炼钢厂的工程师，他向同学们报告他从大学毕业后，在旧社会的一切不幸遭遇，时时感受着生活的压迫和失业的痛苦。解放后，由于共产党对他的培养和教育，在工作中接受了党和行政的领导和帮助，首先丢掉了知识分子自高自大的架子，和群众亲切的打成一片，使自己能够充分的发挥自己的能力，完成了人民政府交给他们的生产任务。他的演讲受到同学们热烈的欢迎。
    在经久不息的掌声中，赵桂兰走到扩音器前，报告她怎样爱护祖国和人民的财产，以及为了保护工厂的安全而受伤四次的经过。然后她说：“在党的、人民的利益与个人利益发生矛盾时，应该毫不犹疑地服从党的利益，牺牲个人利益。”
    讲演结束后在热烈的掌声和欢呼声中，他们接受了同学的献花。
    会后，二位劳动模范代表参观了毛主席在校工作室和李大钊同志纪念室。他们并接受了该室管理同志的请求，给毛主席在校工作室题字。
