Slow Early Rice Procurement in Southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, etc.
East China Financial and Economic Committee Promptly Corrects

[By Our Staff Reporter] According to the *Liberation Daily*: In early September, the East China Financial and Economic Committee inspected the early rice procurement situation in various parts of East China and found that there were quite serious shortcomings in this work. One of the main problems was that some state-owned trading organizations were not timely in their procurement, and speculative merchants took the opportunity to suppress prices, causing farmers to suffer losses from low-price sales. Early rice in East China was successively harvested in early August, with a total output of approximately 7-8 billion jin. It is estimated that about 1.5 billion jin needs to be sold in stages. In order to stabilize grain prices and prevent excessively low grain prices, the East China Grain Company notified trading organizations in various regions to first purchase 160 million jin. However, with the exception of northern Jiangsu, which started procurement earlier, Zhejiang delayed until the second half of August, and southern Jiangsu delayed until the end of August and the beginning of September to start procurement. Preliminary statistics as of early September showed that only over 50 million jin had been actually purchased in various regions, far from meeting the urgent demand of farmers to sell early rice. The reasons for the above shortcomings are mainly due to insufficient clarity in guiding ideology. Although the East China Trade Department and the Grain Company paid relatively close attention to mastering the listed prices to protect the interests of farmers and prevent excessively low grain prices, they underestimated and did not pay enough attention to the urgent demand of farmers to sell early rice, resulting in a lack of timely inspection and supervision after the tasks were assigned. Some objective difficulties in various regions (such as insufficient warehouses, insufficient cadres, etc.) were not resolved in a timely manner, resulting in a slow procurement process.

After discovering the above shortcomings, the East China Financial and Economic Committee promptly corrected them. The *Liberation Daily* also published an editorial on September 23, emphasizing the major economic and political significance of procurement work, pointing out that this year's harvest in most parts of East China is abundant, and that various regions should make good use of cooperative organizations and conscientiously organize private merchants to do a good job in procurement. The leading organs in some areas of East China have also begun to attach importance to this issue. The Zhejiang Provincial People's Government issued an instruction on September 19 to "immediately launch grain procurement work." The instruction pointed out that Zhejiang's harvests of major specialty products such as cotton, hemp, and silk cocoons are better than last year. Therefore, in addition to paying attention to grain procurement, various regions must also prepare in advance to meet the arduous task of procuring specialty products. The Southern Jiangsu Administrative Office convened a meeting focused on autumn procurement work on September 19 and 20, reviewed the procurement situation in the previous period, and strengthened the deployment of future work.

### 苏南浙江等地收购早稻迟缓  华东财委及时纠正

　　苏南浙江等地收购早稻迟缓
    华东财委及时纠正
    【本报讯】据解放日报讯：华东财委于九月初旬检查华东各地早稻收购情况，发现在这个工作中存在着相当严重的缺点。其中主要的一个，是某些国营贸易机关收购不及时，投机商人乘机压价收购，使农民遭受了低价出售的损失。华东区早稻在八月初旬即相继登场，总产量约七、八十亿斤。估计其中须分期出售的有十五亿斤左右。为了稳定粮价，以免谷价过贱，华东粮食公司曾通知各地贸易机关，先收购一亿六千万斤。但除苏北收购较早外，浙江迟至八月下半月，苏南迟至八月底及九月初才开始收购；至九月上旬初步统计，各地实购仅五千余万斤。远不能适应农民急于出售早稻的迫切要求。产生以上缺点的原因，主要是由于领导思想不够明确。华东贸易部和粮食公司虽然比较注意地掌握了为保障农民利益，免使谷价过贱对牌价的掌握是比较注意的，但对农民急于出售早稻的迫切要求估计不足，重视不够，以致任务布置下去后，缺乏及时地检查与督促。各地有些客观困难（如仓库不够，干部不够等）又未能及时解决，结果造成收购工作迟缓的现象。
    华东财委发现以上缺点后，已及时予以纠正。解放日报并于九月二十三日发表社论，强调提出收购工作的经济及政治的重大意义，指出：今年华东大部地区丰收，各地应很好运用合作社组织，并切实组织私商，做好收购工作。华东若干地区的领导机关，也开始重视了这个问题。浙江省人民政府于九月十九日发出“立即展开粮食收购工作”的指示。该指示指出：浙江今年棉、麻、茧等主要特产的收获，均较去年好，因此，各地除应注意收购粮食外，并须预作准备，迎接严重的收购特产的任务。苏南行政公署在九月十九、二十两日召开了以秋季收购工作为中心的会议，检讨了前一时期收购工作的情况，重新加强今后工作的部署。
