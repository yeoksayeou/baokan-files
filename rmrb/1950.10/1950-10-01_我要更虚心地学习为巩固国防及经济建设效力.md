　　I Will Learn More Humbly to Serve the Consolidation of National Defense and Economic Construction
    Li Dexin, Industrial Labor Model of the Central and Southern District
    I truly did not expect that I would come to the people's capital, Beijing, this year to participate in our National Day celebrations. I am very happy to be able to see our great people's leader, Chairman Mao, and spend National Day with Chairman Mao in the capital. Moreover, I will participate in today's grand and magnificent military parade with the creators of our new China. I will see the heroic divisions of our people's navy, army, and air force. In this grand gathering, I will also meet with combat heroes and model workers, peasants, and soldiers from all over the country to celebrate the victory of our new China.
    Looking back at this day last year, Wuhan had just been liberated, and everyone was enthusiastically celebrating the founding ceremony, while I was still in a political school, working on my "unit summary of studying the modern Chinese revolution." Ideologically, I was struggling cruelly and painfully every day. A month later, I was still digging up "the roots of old thinking" in my hospital bed.
    But what about now? I have participated in the war southward, fought stubbornly with the Kuomintang bandit army on the South Ocean, charged back and forth on the ocean surface blockaded by the enemy fleet, and under the enemy's intensive artillery fire, sent the People's Liberation Army to land across the sea, time after time, ship after ship. Despite illness, I persisted in my work, thoroughly executing every combat mission, to fight fiercely with the enemy. I also charged up the mountains with a submachine gun. In order to protect the ships, I almost died in the big waves, but was dragged out of the waves by other comrades. I ate seaweed, went hungry, stayed up for days and nights, and suffered from the cold in the sea on stormy nights. Even when I was too sick to work, I insisted on staying at the front and refused to return... Finally, I completed all the tasks, made meritorious contributions, and returned.
    Today, I am able to receive such glory, first of all, I must thank the leadership and education of the Communist Party of China and our leader Chairman Mao. I think back to the situation a year ago, the Party's education transformed me, made me understand the truth, pointed out the direction for me, and made me understand my responsibility, that I must serve the people well to have a future. It gave me a new life!
    In the future, I will study more humbly, improve myself under the education of the Party, and serve the people better. I will respond to Chairman Mao's call and dedicate my strength to the consolidation of national defense and economic construction.

### 我要更虚心地学习为巩固国防及经济建设效力

　　我要更虚心地学习为巩固国防及经济建设效力
    中南区工业劳动模范  李德心
    真是没有想到今年我会到人民的首都——北京来参加我们的国庆节日。我很欢喜，能够见到我们伟大的人民领袖毛主席，和毛主席一起在首都过国庆，并且将要和我们新中国的创造者一起来参加今天隆重伟大的阅兵式，能看到我们人民的海、陆、空军雄师，在这个盛会中又能和全国各地战斗英雄、工农兵劳动模范们会师一起，来庆祝我们新中国的胜利。
    回想去年的今天，武汉解放不久，人家都在热烈的庆祝开国盛典，而我还在一个政治学校里，搞我的“学习中国现代革命史的单元小结”。思想上，正在成天残酷痛苦地斗争着。一个月以后，我在病床上还在挖“旧思想的根子”。
    但是现在呢？我已参战南下过，在南海洋面上，和国民党匪军顽强战斗过，在敌人舰队群封锁着的洋面上来回冲撞，在敌人密集的炮火下，一次次，一船船送解放军渡海登陆，在疾病中，坚持工作，彻底执行每个战斗任务，来和敌人火拚。我也提着冲锋式往山上冲。为了保护船舶，在大海浪里我几乎死去，而被别的同志们从海浪里拖救起来，我吃过海草，挨过饿，几天几夜不睡觉，在狂风大雨之夜的海中受冻受凉，病得不能工作时，我也坚持在前方不愿回来……，最后终于完成了全部任务，立了功回来了。
    今天我能得到这样的光荣，首先要感谢中国共产党和我们的领袖毛主席的领导和教育。我回想到一年前的情形，党给我的教育改造了我，使我认识了真理，给我指出了方向，明白了自己的责任，必须好好为人民服务才有前途。使我获得了新生命！
    今后，我更要虚心学习，在党的教育下，提高自己。更好地为人民服务。响应毛主席的号召，为巩固国防、经济建设献出我的力量。
