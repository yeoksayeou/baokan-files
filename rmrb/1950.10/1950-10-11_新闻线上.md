　　Four Issues to Note in Correspondents' Work

    The Research Office of the East China News and Publications Bureau published an article in the Liberation Daily on September 22 entitled "Some Issues in Establishing and Leading a Correspondents' Network," which put forward four issues to be noted in future correspondence work:

    First, vigorously develop the worker-peasant correspondent movement. All newspapers, without exception, should make specific plans and action steps for developing the worker-peasant correspondent movement. The difference lies only in the requirements and methods, not in the policy and principle.

    Second, overcome the imbalance in correspondence work. However, the balanced development of correspondence work must be carried out step by step in a planned way, and breakthroughs should be made with emphasis according to specific circumstances. At the same time, this balanced development should not be understood as egalitarianism. It mainly refers to the distribution of the surface, which should be as wide as possible, including all aspects.

    Third, strengthen the political leadership and organizational leadership of correspondents. First of all, it is necessary to educate the people ideologically that participating in becoming a newspaper correspondent is not only for writing articles and improving culture, but more importantly, for actively participating in the country's construction cause. In the work, it must be clear: implement political leadership, issue political propaganda guidelines to correspondents, and ask and answer questions to correspondents from a political perspective.

    Fourth, launch correspondence work competitions on a conditional basis. Through the movement, strengthen correspondents' understanding of newspapers, mobilize everyone to run newspapers, improve newspapers and correspondence work, and more organizedly attract a large number of correspondents to participate in the national construction cause and give play to the correspondents' fighting cause.

    Hubei Provincial Government Attaches Importance to Criticism and Writes Letters to Urge Handling Issues, Which Has Become a System

    Since newspapers have launched criticism and self-criticism, the Hubei Provincial People's Government has attached great importance to the criticisms in the newspapers.

    Li Xiannian, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial People's Government, pays close attention to every critical article published in each issue of the newspaper. Whenever the newspaper is just delivered to the Provincial Government Office in the morning, when Chairman Li calls, people can guess that in all likelihood, there are people's criticisms and suggestions in the newspaper again, and letters need to be written to urge handling them. Under the personal leadership and influence of Chairman Li, from June 3 to September 13, within 102 days, the Provincial Government Office issued 94 letters to governments at all levels related to the criticism, urging the handling of the criticism manuscripts. For more serious situations, the Provincial Government also sent special personnel to the countryside to supervise and inspect, so as to send the facts and handling situations to the newspaper as soon as possible for publication.

    In this way, urging the handling of relevant criticism manuscripts has become a new system of the Provincial Government Office.

    Shanxi Postal District Promotes Distribution, Approaching One Newspaper for Every Village and Every School

    The Shanxi Postal District has worked hard to promote the sale of newspapers in the past six months. The circulation of Shanxi Daily and Shanxi Farmer's Daily has increased, and it has initially achieved the goal of "every village has newspapers to read, and every school has newspapers to read."

    Three experiences have been gained in carrying out distribution work: First, contact the Party, government, and Youth League to strive for unified subscription. Some county post offices negotiated with the county government to implement a method in which the county government uniformly subscribes and pays for newspapers for each village and school, which reduced the difficulty of procedures and insufficient funds, and eliminated blank spots in villages and schools. Second, employees launched distribution competitions, went deep into promotion, and provided more convenience to subscribers. Wang Fuguan, a postal worker in Huo County, helped the masses to sell rice and turn it into money to subscribe to newspapers because the masses wanted to subscribe to newspapers but did not have time to go to the city to sell rice. Third, speed up the transfer speed. From the perspective of the masses' feedback, time is the most important thing. During the rainy season, the newspapers on the Baijin Line could not be delivered on time, and some people wanted to unsubscribe.

    Wanbei Postal District Experiments with Promotion to Solve the Problem of Rural Delivery

    In order to gradually deepen the distribution of newspapers in rural areas, the Wanbei Postal Administration specially sent personnel to the Chengguan District and Donglin District of Hanshan County, Chaohu Prefecture, to experiment with promotion work, and achieved some results.

    In this experiment, the difficulty of delivering newspapers in rural areas with inconvenient transportation was initially solved. In addition to using postal agencies to distribute newspapers in the nearby area of about seven or eight miles, they also established "points" for transferring newspapers along the postal route: in villages near the postal route, find a reliable farmer and put the newspapers in his home at a fixed time every day for safekeeping, and then the township or administrative village will send a semi-labor force messenger to pick them up. Villages that are not close to the postal route use the original delivery post organization to universally organize semi-labor force farmers to carry out delivery between townships. However, this kind of delivery organization must be established on the principle of farmers' conscious voluntariness, and the implementation of the system of alternating delivery with small wooden signs can avoid problems and maintain the normal operation of delivery work.

    The editors of Wanbei Daily suggested that the mailboxes and postal agencies scattered in various places almost all have their own main occupations, and can only play a role in receiving and sending letters and newspapers. Many newspapers cannot go any further once they arrive at the mailbox. Therefore, local post offices should negotiate with local governments to organize semi-labor forces, or make agreements with subscriber reading groups to automatically pick up newspapers at the mailbox, so that newspapers can penetrate into rural areas more quickly, without hindering rural production.

    通讯员工作中应注意的四个问题
    华东新闻出版局研究室在九月二十二日解放日报上发表《关于建立和领导通讯员网工作中的一些问题》一文，提出今后通讯工作中应注意的四个问题：
    第一，大力开展工农通讯员运动，任何报纸都无例外地应作出开展工农通讯员运动的具体计划和行动步骤，不同的只是要求和方法问题，而不是方针原则问题。
    第二，克服通讯工作中的不平衡现象。但通讯工作的平衡发展，必须有计划有步骤地逐步进行，要根据具体情况，有重点的予以突破。同时这种平衡发展，不应理解为平均主义，主要是指面的分布，应力求广泛，包括各个方面。
    第三，加强通讯员的政治领导和组织领导。首先要从思想上教育人民群众，参加做报纸通讯员，不仅为了写稿和提高文化，更重要的是为了积极地参加国家的建设事业，在工作中必须明确：实行政治领导，向通讯员颁发政治宣传方针，并从政治角度上向通讯员提出和解答问题。
    第四，在有条件的基础上发动通讯工作竞赛。通过运动，加强通讯员对报纸的认识，发动大家办报，将报纸和通讯工作提高一步，并更有组织地吸引广大通讯员参加国家建设事业，发挥通讯员的战斗事业。
    湖北省府重视批评  写信催办成了制度
    自从报纸上展开了批评和自我批评以后，湖北省人民政府对报纸上的批评非常重视。
    湖北省人民政府李先念主席密切地注意每一期报纸上所发表的批评性文章。每当早上报纸刚送到省府办公厅不久时，李主席打电话来了，人们就可以猜到，十有八九是报上又有了人民的批评和建议，需要写信催办。在李主席亲自带动和影响之下，从六月三日到九月十三日一百零两天内，省府办公厅向与批评有关的各级政府发出了九十四封催办批评稿件的信。情节较重的，省府还派专人下乡督促检查，以便把事实经过和处理情形及早送给报社发表。
    就这样，催办有关批评稿件就成了省府办公厅的新的制度了。
    山西邮区推广发行  接近每村每校有报
    山西邮区半年来努力推销报纸，山西日报和山西农民报的发行额均有增加，初步达到了“村村有报看、校校有报读”的目标。
    在开展发行工作中取得了三点经验：第一，与党、政、团取得联系，争取统一代订。有的县邮局与县政府商洽，实行各村校报纸由县府统一代订付费办法，减少了手续与经费不足的困难，消灭了村校空白点。第二，员工掀起发行竞赛，深入推销，多给订户方便。霍县邮工王富管，因群众想订报，没时间进城粜米，他即代为粜米变钱，订了报。第三，增快转递速度，从群众反映来看，时间是最主要的，雨季中白晋线的报纸不能按时送到，有的群众就要退报。
    皖北邮区实验推销  解决农村投递问题
    皖北邮政管理局为了使报纸发行逐渐深入农村，特派专人到巢湖专区含山县的城关区和东林区实验推销工作，获得了一些成绩。
    在这次试验中，初步解决了报纸在交通不便的乡村中投递的困难问题。他们除了利用邮政代办所分送附近约七八里路地区的报纸以外，并沿邮运线建立转运报纸的“点”：在靠近邮运线的乡村中，找一可靠的农民，每天定时把报纸放在他家里保存，再由乡或行政村派半劳动力的传递者，到他那里去取。不靠近邮运线的乡村，则利用原有递步哨组织，普遍组织半劳动力的农民，进行乡与乡之间的传递。不过这种投递组织一定要建立在农民自觉自愿的原则上，和实行利用小木牌轮流交递制度，才可避免出毛病，保持投递工作正常进行。
    皖北日报编者建议，散布在各地的邮柜、邮政代办所，差不多都另有自己的主要职业，对信件报纸只能起收发作用，许多报纸一到了邮柜即不能再走。因此，各地邮局应与当地政府协议，在不妨碍农村生产条件下，将半劳动力组织起来，或与订户读报组约好，自动到邮柜取报，以便报纸能较快地深入农村。
