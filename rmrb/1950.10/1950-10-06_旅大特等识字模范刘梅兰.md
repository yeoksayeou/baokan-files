　　Liu Meilan, Model Literacy Worker of the Lüda Special Class
　　(Special correspondent Zhou Yaodong Tang Jian)
　　It's hard to believe, but before the literacy campaign in the Lüda area in 1949, Liu Meilan was illiterate. Just one year later, she can recognize over three thousand characters and write work summaries. Her work has frequently appeared in the Lüda People's Daily. Because of her remarkable academic achievements, last year she was elected a special-class model student in the Lüda area, the most outstanding of the nine special-class literacy models in the area, recognizing the most characters and achieving the greatest results. She is one of the representatives of the Lüda area attending the Workers' and Peasants' Education Conference.
　　Why could Liu Meilan achieve such great results? She wanted to study since she was a child, longing to go from elementary school to middle school and then to university, but these were just dreams. At that time, she couldn't even get enough to eat. Her mother died when she was six, and her father left to make a living, leaving her to be raised by her aunt. Lonely Liu Meilan went to work in a factory at the age of eleven, making paper boxes and doing odd jobs.
　　After liberation, she became a repair worker at the Lüda area's Weights and Measures Factory. Last year, all the workers in the factory studied a document on the workers' movement. Afterwards, the trade union conducted a test. At that time, Liu Meilan didn't recognize a single character and had to hand in a blank paper with her eyes closed, feeling very anxious. Liu Meilan thought, "We say we want to be masters of the new society, but without culture, how can we be good masters?" In March last year, the literacy campaign was launched in the Lüda area, and she was the first to join the literacy class for illiterates.
　　Every morning, when others were sleeping soundly, Liu Meilan quietly got up and walked into the literacy class to study on her own. After the dormitory lights went out at ten o'clock in the evening, she secretly went to the corridor to study. In this way, she squeezed out four hours of study time every day, going to bed late and getting up early. She practiced the literacy textbook over and over, read the new words fluently, and then dictated them ten times until she remembered them. She could recognize seven to ten new words a day, which amounted to more than two thousand words in ten months.
　　She said: "Learning to read is not afraid of asking questions, only afraid of not asking." Once she came across the character "惠" (huì, benefit), and she couldn't recognize it after looking at it for a long time. She asked a fellow worker, but this fellow worker was also careless and stammered that it was the character "喜" (xǐ, happiness). She asked another fellow worker, who said it was the character "劈" (pī, split). She asked several people and none of them pronounced it correctly. She almost followed suit and mispronounced it, but luckily she was diligent in asking and finally found out the correct pronunciation. So she gained an experience: "Ask more." She asked many people: cadres, staff, fellow workers, and sometimes also her two apprentices.
　　If she couldn't remember the words she asked about, she would draw something under that character to help her remember it. If it was the character "秤" (chèng, scale), she would draw a scale pan and a scale bar; if it was the character "表" (biǎo, watch), she would draw a circle and then draw two hands inside. Once she learned the character "值" (zhí, value), but she couldn't remember it no matter how hard she tried, so she automatically worked a day shift. Later, as soon as she saw this character, she remembered that she had worked a day shift for it, and this time she remembered it firmly. In order to recognize more characters, Liu Meilan came up with a way of her own. Once, people saw that her hands were covered with words written all over them. Some people thought she wanted to show off, but that was not the case. She said, "It's not convenient for me to carry a book when I go there, so I write on my hands and stretch them out from my sleeves, and I can see them. Because the words written on my hands are all new words, it's not easy to forget them."
　　As time went on, she recognized more and more characters, and it became easier to learn technology. One day, many new types of anemometers came to the factory, some with broken tubes and some with broken pull rods. The internal devices of the anemometers were filled with many strange things. She asked Master Jia about everything she didn't understand. The master told her why the "Bourdon tube" would contract and expand, and why it would make the anemometer inaccurate if it was loose; why the pull rod must be repaired if the shoulder face gear was worn. Then she understood that if the anemometer needle exceeded the graduation standard, the pull rod should be extended to a certain extent, and if it did not meet the standard, the pull rod should be contracted to a certain extent. The test standard must also use a "pressure gauge calibrator." Afterwards, Liu Meilan did everything right, and the master was surprised: "Hey! You couldn't remember this kind of work even after I told you two or three times before, how can you do it so fast now!" Later, Master Jia saw that she had written down everything he had told her, word for word. Liu Meilan said: "After I learned to read, I wanted to use it in production. When I have culture, I also use my brain, which makes it much easier to learn technology." So she gradually became dissatisfied with some outdated old technologies, and she tried her best to improve her operating techniques, and put forward several rationalization proposals in a row. She improved the cumbersome operation method of one person holding and one person pouring lead into the steam meter tube, and the work efficiency was significantly improved. The old record was two and a half days for two people to pour two hundred lead, and her record was two hours and thirty minutes for one person to complete two hundred lead.
　　After learning had a certain foundation, she worked harder to study. She read many books, including "Party Constitution Materials," "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists," "The Work and Tasks of the Communist Youth League," "Shangrao Concentration Camp," and "Xia Hongqiu." From these books, she understood many principles.
　　Liu Meilan is now the Youth Work Committee member of the Chinese Communist Party branch, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, and a trade union member in the Lüda area Weights and Measures Factory. She has many positions and her work is also very heavy. Under normal circumstances, there is no way to persist in learning. But she reads books for more than two hours almost every day and writes for an hour. Recently, she has been studying arithmetic with the staff and has never interrupted her studies.

　　旅大特等识字模范刘梅兰
    （本报特约通讯员  周耀东  唐简）
    说起来真难令人相信，刘梅兰在一九四九年旅大地区开展识字运动以前，还是一个大字不识的文盲，一年以后的今天，她已经识了三千多字，会写工作总结。她的作品已经经常出现在旅大人民日报上。因为她的显著的学习成绩，在去年，她就当选了旅大地区特等学习模范，是该区九个特等识字模范中最突出的一个，识字最多，成绩最大。为旅大区出席工农教育会议代表之一。
    为什么刘梅兰能获得这样大的成绩呢？她小时候就很想念书，心窝里巴望着从小学到中学再到大学，这些，只不过是想想罢了。那时候，连饭都吃不饱，六岁上死了妈，爸爸为了生活，远远的走了，由她的姑母将她抚养。孤零零的刘梅兰十一岁就下了工厂，糊纸盒、作杂工。
    解放后，她在旅大区度量衡工厂当了修理工人。去年工厂全体工友曾经学习一个职工运动文件，以后，工会进行了一次测验，当时刘梅兰一个字不识，只好闭着两眼交白卷，心里非常着急。刘梅兰心里想：“开口说要当新社会主人，闭口说要当新社会主人，要没有文化，这个主人怎能当好呢？”去年三月，旅大地区开展了识字运动，她第一个参加了文盲识字班。
    每天早晨，当别人睡得又香又甜的时候，刘梅兰就悄悄地爬起来，走进了识字班的教室，自个去学习。晚上十点钟宿舍熄灯后，她就偷偷地走到廊台上去学习。就这样晚睡早起，每天挤出了四小时的学习时间。她把识字课本翻来复去的练习，熟读生字，然后默写十遍，直到记住为止。一天她能认七个到十个生字，十个月就是二千多字。
    她说：“学识字不怕多问，就怕不问。”有一次她碰见一个“惠”字，端量半天也不认识，去问一个工友，这个工友也很马虎，吞吞吐吐地说是个“喜”字，又去问另一个工友，又说是个“劈”字。问了好几个人都没念对，她差一点也跟着念错了，幸亏着嘴勤，后来终于打听明白了。于是她得了一个经验：“多问”。她问的对象很多：问干部，问职员，问工友，有时也问她的两个徒弟。
    问来的字倘若记不住，就在那个字底下画个东西来帮助记忆，如果是“秤”字，就画个秤盘，秤杆；是“表”字，就画个圆圈圈，里面再画上两根针。有一次学了个“值”字，左记右记总也记不住，就自动值了一天班，后来，一看见这个字就想起了她曾经为它值了一天班，这回记牢了。为了识更多的字，刘梅兰自己想了个办法。一次，人们看见她两只手上横七竖八写满了一片字。有的人以为她想出风头，实际上不是的，她说：“我到那儿去的时候，带着书不方便，写在手上把手从袖口里一伸就看见了，因为写在手上的通是生字，这样不大容易忘。”
    日久天长，她识的字逐渐多起来，学技术也容易了。一天，工厂里来了很多很多没有见过的风表，有管子坏了的，也有拉杆坏了的。风表内部装置着许多古古怪怪的东西，不明白的地方，她一样一样的去问贾师傅。师父告诉她：“布尔顿管子”为什么会缩涨，为什么它松了就使风表不准确；为什么肩面牙轮磨损了，就必须修理拉杆。随后她又明白了风表表针超过分度标准量，就应该把拉杆伸放到一定程度，如果不够标准，就把拉杆收缩到一定程度。试验标准，也必须用“压力计标器”。随后，刘梅兰干的一点也不错，师傅奇怪了：“咦！从前像这样没干过的活，告诉两遍三遍也记不住，如今怎么干的这样快呀！”后来贾师傅看见她把他告诉她的话都一句一句用笔记上了。刘梅兰说：“识了字，我就想把它用到生产上，自己有了文化，同时开动了脑子，对学技术可就方便多了。”于是她渐渐对一些死套的老技术看不顺眼了，她尽力把自己操作的技术改进着，一连提了几次合理化建议。汽表管子往里边灌铅，她改进了一人扶，一人灌的笨重操作法，工作效率显著提高了。旧记录是以两人两天半的时间，灌二百根铅，她的记录是以一个人两点三十分钟的时间，完成二百根。
    学习有了一定的基础以后，她更加努力的进行学习。她看了很多书，有“党章教材”，“论共产党员的修养”、“青年团的工作与任务”，“上饶集中营”，“夏红秋”等。从这些书里，使她懂得了很多道理。
    刘梅兰现在在旅大区度量衡工厂里担任该厂中共支部的青工委员，青年团的支部书记，工会委员，职务很多，工作也很繁重，在通常的情形下，是没有办法坚持学习的。可是她差不多每天都读二小时以上的书，写一个钟头的字，最近她和职员一块学习算术，从来也没有间断过学习。
