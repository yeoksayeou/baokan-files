Xinhua News Agency, 8th. According to the German News Agency: President Wilhelm Pieck of the German Democratic Republic delivered a radio address on the anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, discussing the significance of the founding of the Republic and its great achievements over the past year. Pieck said: The German Democratic Republic has already won equal rights for the German people among peace-loving countries. We owe this position entirely to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Currently, our Republic has been recognized by all countries in the peace camp and maintains diplomatic relations with almost all of them. On the eve of the anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, we are particularly pleased to hear the news that the Ambassador of the People's Republic of China, representing the 450 million Chinese people engaged in a heroic struggle for freedom, is on his way to our country.

Pieck went on to talk about the achievements of the German Democratic Republic in the past year, pointing out that, thanks to the creative enthusiasm of industrial and agricultural activists, the two-year economic recovery plan was completed in a year and a half, creating the preconditions for a significant improvement in living standards. He said that the German people will also victoriously complete new tasks, doubling industrial production, developing and expanding livestock breeding, building fishing fleets and new ocean-going merchant fleets, increasing people's incomes by 60 percent, massively restoring cities and villages destroyed by British and American bombing, increasing the number of industrial workers by 900,000, and training skilled new worker cadres, a large number of technicians, engineers, chemists, and researchers in all specialized sciences. However, the realization of these ideals requires all anti-fascists to further strengthen cooperation, and requires all true German patriots to further unite around the National Front.

Pieck expressed the German people's unreserved support for the Soviet Union's peace proposals at the United Nations, while strongly condemning the Western occupying powers for threatening peace, pursuing war policies in West Germany, causing hardship for the German people there, and threatening them with destruction.

Pieck then said: All the German people want peace! If the residents of West Germany cooperate with the German Democratic Republic to jointly implement a peace policy and demand the cessation of any armament and militarization, then the imperialist war provocations will inevitably be defeated, and the reunification of Germany will definitely be rebuilt.

Pieck called on the people of West Germany to learn from the painful lessons of history and not to be led down the wrong path of opposing the German Democratic Republic. He said: The German Democratic Republic stands like a solid fortress of peace policy. The existence of the German Democratic Republic tells all our people that our pressing problems can be solved by our own efforts.

Pieck concluded confidently: The path we have taken is the only correct path, and it will lead us to a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany. We have laid the foundation for our economic recovery through our own efforts and are moving forward along the right path. The great and invincible camp of peace, democracy, and socialism has recognized the German Democratic Republic as an independent and sovereign state. That is why our achievements enable us to look forward to our future with hope, a future full of work, but also of peace and happiness. The victory of our October 15 election will greatly help to achieve this future.

　　庆祝德意志民主共和国成立一周年
    德总统皮克发表广播演说
    表示德国坚决支持苏联在联大的和平建议
    号召全德人民用自己的努力争取祖国统一
    【新华社八日讯】据德意志通讯社报道：德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克于德意志民主共和国成立周年纪念日发表广播演说，论述共和国成立的意义和一年来的伟大成就。皮克说：德意志民主共和国已经在爱好和平的国家之中为德意志人民赢得了平等的权利。我们获得这个地位全赖苏维埃社会主义共和国联邦。目前，我们共和国已得到和平阵营中一切国家的承认并且几乎和它们全体都维持着外交关系。我们在德意志民主共和国成立周年纪念日的前夕特别高兴地听到这样的一个消息：代表为争取自由而从事英勇斗争的四亿五千万中国人民的中华人民共和国大使已在来我国的途中了。
    皮克继谈到德意志民主共和国过去一年中的成就，指出：由于工业和农业积极分子的创造性热忱，经济复兴二年计划得以在一年半内完成，使得生活水准的大大提高有了先决条件。他说，德国人民并将同样地胜利完成新的任务，增加工业产品两倍，发展和扩张牲口繁殖，建设渔船队和新的远洋商船队，增加人民收入百分之六十，大规模地恢复由于英美军队的轰炸而破坏的城市和乡村，增加产业工人九十万，训练熟练的新工人干部、大量的技术人员、工程师、化学家和一切专门科学的研究工作者。然而这些理想的实现要求一切反法西斯的人们更进一步加强合作，要求德国全体真正爱国者更进一步地团结在全国阵线周围。
    皮克表示德国人民无保留地支持苏联在联大提出的和平建议，同时强烈谴责西方占领国家威胁和平，在西部德国奉行战争政策，为那里的德国人民造成困苦的生活和使他们遭受毁灭的威胁。
    皮克然后说道：全体德国人民是要和平的！如果西德居民同德意志民主共和国并肩合作共同执行和平政策，要求停止任何武装与军国主义化，那末，帝国主义的战争挑衅就不可避免地要遭到失败，德国的统一就一定能重建。
    皮克号召西德的人民从惨痛的历史吸取教训，不要被人带上反对德意志民主共和国的错误道路。他说：德意志民主共和国象一个和平政策的坚固堡垒似的屹立着。德意志民主共和国的存在告诉我们全体人民：我们切身的问题是可以用我们自己的努力来解决的。
    皮克最后确信地说：我们所走过的道路是唯一正确的道路，它将把我们带到统一、民主、爱好和平的德国。我们已用我们自己的努力奠定了我们经济复兴的基础，并正沿着正确的道路前进。伟大的不可征服的和平民主与社会主义阵营已承认德意志民主共和国为独立自主的国家。这就是为什么我们的成就使我们能够满怀希望瞻望着我们的前途，这个前途是充满着工作，但又是和平与幸福的。我们十月十五日选举的胜利将大大地有助于达到这种前途。
