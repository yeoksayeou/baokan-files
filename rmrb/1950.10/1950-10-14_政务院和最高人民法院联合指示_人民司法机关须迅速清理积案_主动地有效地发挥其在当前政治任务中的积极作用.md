　　Joint Directive of the Government Administration Council and the Supreme People's Court
    People's Judicial Organs Must Quickly Clear Backlogged Cases
    Actively and Effectively Play Their Positive Role in the Current Political Tasks
    [Xinhua News Agency, 13th] The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and the Supreme People's Court jointly issued a directive on the rapid clearance of backlog cases by the people's judicial organs, the full text of which is as follows:

    People's judicial organs in various regions are beginning to clear backlogged cases. Some regions have completed this work and gained experience. However, on the whole, the backlog of cases in various regions is still quite serious. The failure to quickly clear backlogged cases is sufficient to deprive the law of timely and effective punishment and education for some counter-revolutionaries and other criminals, affecting the establishment and consolidation of revolutionary order. At the same time, it causes litigants to suffer from the delays of litigation, affecting production. The work of the people's judicial organs will also be placed in a passive position, and they will not be able to effectively play their positive role in the current political tasks of the country. For this reason, people's governments and people's judicial organs at all levels should analyze the current situation of backlogged cases, adopt a prudent and responsible attitude and effective methods, and strive to complete the clearance of backlogged cases within a certain period of time, and prevent the continued occurrence of backlogged cases. The following instructions are given on the principles of clearing cases and the points to be noted:

    1. Rapidly clear unsettled criminal cases:

    1.  For counter-revolutionary criminals whose crimes are heinous and the evidence is true, they should be sentenced promptly in accordance with the instructions of this court on suppressing counter-revolutionary activities on July 23 this year.

    2.  If there is suspicion of a crime but the evidence is insufficient, and it is impossible to seek further evidence, except for counter-revolutionary criminals, they should be educated and released or released on bail, depending on the circumstances of the case.

    3.  Those who have been wrongly detained should be released immediately.

    4.  For those unsettled criminal cases that should not be released or bailed, the investigation, prosecution (or non-prosecution), or trial should be carried out promptly, depending on the stage of the case.

    2.  The clearance of backlogged cases should be combined with the current social situation and work situation in the local area. Counter-revolutionary cases, cases of sabotage of national economic construction, and cases that have a significant impact on the current social and work situation in the local area should be seized upon and cleared quickly.

    3.  People's governments at all levels must earnestly lead the work of clearing backlogged cases. When necessary, a group of cadres should be transferred from other organs to temporarily assist in the work; and depending on the nature of the case, relevant organs and organizations should be invited to assist in the handling (such as counter-revolutionary, marriage, labor-capital, industrial and commercial debt cases, which may be handled with the assistance of public security, women's federations, trade unions, financial and economic departments, or industrial and commercial bureaus). The people's courts of provinces (administrative offices) and cities should formulate practical plans for clearing backlogged cases, supervise their implementation, and may organize forces to select key counties (cities) to provide assistance, in order to gain experience and promote the clearance of cases quickly and effectively.

    4.  In the work of clearing backlogged cases, people's judicial organs at all levels should strive to simplify litigation procedures and eliminate the formalism and bureaucracy of the old judicial system among some personnel; at the same time, it is essential to strictly prevent any careless and perfunctory attitude in the clearance of backlogged cases.

    5.  In order to smoothly complete the work of clearing backlogged cases and prevent the continued occurrence of backlogged cases, people's judicial organs at all levels should immediately establish a strict arrest and detention system, emphasize the concept of the rule of law, strengthen the work of receiving cases on duty, solve cases that can be solved immediately, and not detain people who do not need to be detained or can be released; and should link with the local social conditions and work situation, try out the system of representatives elected by organs and organizations to participate in the jury, and try out comrade trial meetings within organs and organizations to conduct mediation and adjudication work, as well as implement circuit trials, on-the-spot trials, carry out district and village mediation and judicial education, etc., in order to consolidate and expand the effect of the case clearance work, and thereby establish and improve the people's judicial system and improve the people's judicial work in the future.

    It is hoped that people's governments and people's judicial organs at all levels will earnestly implement the above instructions and report the implementation to the next level.

　　政务院和最高人民法院联合指示
    人民司法机关须迅速清理积案
    主动地有效地发挥其在当前政治任务中的积极作用
    【新华社十三日讯】中央人民政府政务院与最高人民法院联合发表关于人民司法机关迅速清理积案的指示，全文如下：
    各地人民司法机关，正在着手进行清理积案工作，有的地区已告完成并获得经验，但总的看来，目前各地案件积压现象，仍相当严重。积案的不能迅速清理，足以使法律对一些反革命分子及其他罪犯失去及时有效的惩罚和教育，影响革命秩序的建立和巩固，同时使诉讼当事人受到诉讼拖延之累，影响生产，而人民司法机关的工作亦将因而陷于被动，不能有效地发挥其在国家当前政治任务中的积极作用。为此，各级人民政府及人民司法机关应把积案的现状加以分析，采取慎重负责的态度和切实有效的办法，争取在一定时间内完成清理积案工作，并防止积案现象的继续发生。兹就清案方针及应注意之点，作如下的指示：
    一、迅速清理未决案犯：
    １、对罪大恶极证据属实的反革命案犯，应照本年七月二十三日本院关于镇压反革命活动的指示迅速判处。
    ２、有犯罪嫌疑而证据不足，且无法再寻求证据者，除反革命犯外，应分别案情，予以教育释放，或交保释放。
    ３、羁押错误者，应立即释放。
    ４、未决案犯不应予以释放或保释者，应即分别案件进行的阶段，迅予侦查、起诉（或不起诉处置）或进行审判。
    二、清理积案应与当地当前社会情况及工作情况相结合。对反革命案件、破坏国家经济建设案件及与当地当前社会情况工作情况有着重大影响的案件，应抓紧时机，迅予清理。
    三、各级人民政府须认真领导清理积案工作，必要时应从其他机关抽调一批干部，临时协助工作；并酌量案件性质，邀请有关机关团体分别协助处理（如反革命、婚姻、劳资、工商债务等案件，得由公安、妇联、工会、财经部门或工商局协助处理）。省（行署）市人民法院应制定切实的清理积案计划，督促执行，并可组织力量，选择重点县（市）予以帮助，以期取得经验迅速有效地推进清案工作。
    四、各级人民司法机关在清理积案工作中，应力求切实简化诉讼手续，清除部分人员中因袭旧司法制度的形式主义和文牍主义的作风；同时必须严格防止对清理积案发生任何粗枝大叶马虎了事的轻率态度。
    五、为了顺利地完成清理积案工作并防止积案现象的继续发生，各级人民司法机关应即建立严格的捕押制度，严肃法治观念，加强值日的收案工作，对能即时解决的案件，即时予以解决，对不必或可以不收押的人即不予收押，并应联系当地社会条件与工作情况，试行由机关团体推选代表参加陪审的制度和在机关团体内部试行同志审判会进行调解公断工作，以及实行巡回审判、就地审判，开展区村调解与司法宣教等工作，以求巩固和扩大清案工作的效果，并由此建立与健全人民司法制度和改进今后人民司法工作。
    以上指示，希各级人民政府及人民司法机关切实执行，并将执行情况按级报告。
