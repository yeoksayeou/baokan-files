(Xinhua News Agency, 3rd) The entire delegation of the National Conference of Combat Heroes and the National Conference of Model Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers issued a "Letter to the People's Army and Working People of the Whole Country." The full text is as follows:

Comrades Commanders and Fighters of the entire People's Liberation Army! Comrades workers, peasants, and all working people across the country!

On the eve of the first National Day of the People's Republic of China, we, elected by you as representatives of combat heroes and labor models, gathered in the capital of the motherland to solemnly hold the National Conference of Combat Heroes and the National Conference of Model Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers. This is truly an unprecedented pioneering undertaking in Chinese history, and it is something that all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army and all workers and peasants should rejoice and celebrate. We feel indescribable excitement and endless glory in participating in this conference.

Our government summoned us to Beijing to hold such a grand conference during the first grand National Day celebration and asked us to participate in the National Day celebrations. This alone shows that our country and our government are fundamentally different from any previous dynasty and are truly the people's country and the people's government. This shows that we, the toiling masses who were long despised and oppressed in the past, have truly turned over and truly become the masters of the country.

At this conference, we met Chairman Mao, whom everyone had been longing to see, and also met other central leaders. They all attended the meeting and spoke to us, giving us many valuable instructions.

At this conference, there were a total of 887 heroic model representatives from various military and production fronts across the country and from various ethnic groups. Everyone exchanged experiences and learned from each other, which enriched each of us with much new knowledge and gave us great encouragement.

At this conference, we also received congratulatory telegrams and letters from leading organs and comrades from all over the country, giving us much encouragement and education. We clearly know that all military and production and construction achievements are the result of the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and the Communist Party of China, the result of the concerted efforts of the broad masses, and the result of countless comrades' bloodshed and sacrifice. We are meeting here representing five million heroic People's Liberation Army soldiers and representing over 400 million working people. Our glory is actually the glory of all the comrades in the army, the glory of the people of the whole country, and the glory that Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and the Communist Party have given to all of us.

This conference was convened after the great victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary war. Our brave and hardworking Chinese people and the invincible People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, and with the assistance of the socialist Soviet Union and the people's democratic forces of various countries, after decades of long-term revolutionary struggle and revolutionary war, defeated the bandit army of Japanese imperialism, eliminated the eight million bandit troops of the Kuomintang fully supported by US imperialism, basically overthrew the heinous rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and established a unified new country of people's democratic dictatorship, enabling the Chinese people to stand tall in the world. Our conference is to commend and encourage the revolutionary heroic spirit of the Chinese people in the revolutionary struggle who are fearless, courageous, and not afraid of any difficulties or enemies, and the active creative spirit in all people's undertakings.

Now, the revolutionary cause of our Chinese people has not ended, the Liberation War has not ended, and the construction of the new country is just beginning. At this time, our mortal enemy, US imperialism, is once again engaging in mad adventures, carrying out new wars of aggression, invading our friendly neighbor Korea, occupying our territory Taiwan, and sending aircraft to invade our airspace, killing our peaceful residents, and threatening the lives, property, and construction of our Chinese people. This requires all our people to be more highly vigilant, carry forward our revolutionary traditions, and prepare to wage a tenacious struggle against the enemy. We have full determination and confidence to defeat any enemy who dares to provoke us and to liberate all of our territory.

At this conference, Chairman Mao told us: "China must establish strong national defense forces and strong economic forces." This brilliant instruction is a guideline that all our people should unite and strive to implement for their own and their children's happiness. Only by establishing strong national defense forces can we defend our national territory, defend our fruits of victory, defend production and construction, and shatter the imperialist conspiracy to launch wars of aggression and defend world peace. Only by establishing strong economic forces can the new China truly become prosperous and strong, can national defense construction be fully materially guaranteed, can the people's lives continue to improve, and can imperialism dare not risk aggression. Therefore, our entire army and people must demonstrate a higher spirit of patriotism and revolutionary heroism and transform Chairman Mao's instructions into our actual actions.

Comrades of the entire People's Liberation Army! You have established countless merits in the revolutionary war and have been praised by the broad masses of the people. You must continue to carry forward this glorious tradition, strive to improve military technology, learn from the advanced military experience of the Soviet Union, and build our People's Liberation Army into an army that is familiar with modern combat technology and combined with unparalleled courage, and build it into a more powerful and invincible national defense force. The troops standing on the front lines of national defense must resolutely fight for the liberation of Taiwan and Tibet and resolutely fight to defend the sacred territory of the motherland and world peace. Our public security forces and militia forces should actively suppress bandits, resolutely suppress all counter-revolutionary activities, protect local security, and protect all production and construction undertakings.

Comrades workers and staff! In the past revolutionary war, in the struggle to protect state property and strive for a preliminary improvement in financial and economic conditions, you have developed the working class's awareness, courage, and revolutionary creativity. In the future, in the work of striving for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation and establishing strong economic and national defense forces, it is even more necessary to give play to the vanguard role of the working class, carry forward the attitude of the masters of labor, launch production competitions, strive to learn technology, increase output and quality, strengthen labor discipline, eliminate all waste phenomena, reduce costs, and conscientiously complete the production tasks assigned by the state, in order to promote national economic construction and improve our own material lives.

Comrades farmers across the country! In the revolutionary war and in the cause of building a new China, the farmers in the old liberated areas have already demonstrated their infinite perseverance and powerful strength. In the future, they should constantly improve their production enthusiasm, implement production mutual assistance, improve technology, cultivate intensively and meticulously, build water conservancy projects, plant trees and forests, prevent floods, droughts, and insect plagues, and strive for new harvests. Peasant comrades in the newly liberated areas should resolutely implement the Land Reform Law promulgated by the Central People's Government, complete land reform in a planned and orderly manner, so that all peasants can get rid of the oppressed and exploited poor lives, strive to produce, and embark on the road to freedom and prosperity.

We, the entire delegation, hereby swear: We must act in accordance with the earnest advice of Chairman Mao and the central leaders, never be arrogant or complacent, never slacken in the slightest, and continue to work hard in combat and work, learn from the broad masses, and unite closely with the comrades around us to jointly carry out new and great tasks.

We hope that after this National Conference of Combat Heroes and Labor Models, a widespread revolutionary heroism movement will be launched across the country, continue to create more heroic and model deeds, so that our national defense construction and economic construction will progress faster, in order to give a greater blow to the imperialist conspiracy of aggression, and make our glorious motherland - the People's Republic of China - increasingly strong!

Long live the heroic people's revolutionary cause and people's construction cause!

Long live the comrades of the entire commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army!

Long live the working people of the whole of China!

Long live the great People's Republic of China!

Long live the great people's leader Chairman Mao!

　　全国英雄模范两代表会议全体代表
    告全国军队和劳动人民书
    【新华社三日讯】全国战斗英雄代表会议和全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的全体代表发表《告全国军队和劳动人民书》。全文如下：全体人民解放军的指挥员、战斗员同志们！全国的工人、农民和一切劳动人民同志们！
    在中华人民共和国的第一个国庆节的前夜，我们被你们推选为战斗英雄和劳动模范的代表，在祖国的首都会合，隆重地举行了全国战斗英雄代表会议和全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议。这真是中国历史上空前未有的创举，这真是值得全体人民解放军的指战员和一切工人农民们欢欣庆贺的事。我们参加这次大会，更感到有说不出来的兴奋和说不尽的光荣。
    我们的政府在举行第一次盛大的国庆纪念的时候，把我们召集到北京来举行这样盛大的会议，并要我们参加庆祝国庆典礼，单就这件事情，已经表明我们的国家，我们的政府，比以前任何朝代根本不同，是真正人民的国家，人民的政府；这表明我们这些在过去长久被人轻视、被人压迫的劳苦大众真正翻了身，真正成了国家的主人翁了。
    在这次会议上，我们见到了大家整天想望着的毛主席，也见到了中央的其他各位首长。他们都出席会议向我们讲了话，给了我们许多宝贵的指示。
    在这次会议上，来自全国各个军事战线和生产战线上的各民族的英雄模范代表共有八百八十七人，大家互相交换经验，互相学习，使我们每个人都增加了很多新的知识，得到了很大的鼓舞。
    在这次会议上，我们又接到全国各领导机关和各个方面同志的来电、来信祝贺，给了我们许多的鼓励和教育。我们清楚地知道，一切军事上和生产建设上的成就，都是毛主席、中央人民政府和中国共产党英明领导的结果，都是广大群众一致奋斗的结果，也是无数同志流血牺牲所换来的结果。我们在这里开会，是代表五百万英勇的人民解放军，是代表四万万以上的劳动人民。我们的光荣，实际是全军同志的光荣，是全国人民的光荣，是毛主席、中央人民政府和共产党给我们大家的光荣。
    这次会议，是在中国人民的革命战争得到伟大胜利之后召开的。我们勇敢勤劳的中国人民和无敌的人民解放军，在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，在社会主义苏联和各国人民民主力量的援助之下，经过几十年的长期革命斗争和革命战争，打败了日本帝国主义的强盗军队，消灭了美帝国主义全力支持的国民党八百万匪军，基本上推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的万恶统治，建立了人民民主专政的统一的新国家，使我们中国人民在世界上挺身站立起来了。我们这次会议，就是要表扬和鼓励中国人民在革命斗争中奋不顾身、勇往直前、不怕任何困难、不怕任何敌人的革命英雄气概，和在一切人民事业中的积极创造精神。
    现在，我们中国人民的革命事业并没有结束，解放战争也还没有结束，新国家的建设事业还正在开始。在这时候，我们的死敌——美帝国主义又在疯狂昌险，进行新的侵略战争，打进我们的友邻朝鲜，侵占我国的领土台湾，并派遣飞机，侵入我国领空，杀害我们的和平居民，威胁着我们中国人民的生命财产和建设事业。这就使我们全国人民更要高度地警惕起来，发扬我们的革命传统，准备与敌人作顽强的斗争。我们有充分的决心和信心一定要打败任何一个敢于向我们挑衅的敌人，一定要解放我国的全部领土。
    在这次会议上，毛主席告诉我们：“中国必须建立强大的国防力量和强大的经济力量。”这个英明指示，是我们全国人民为了自己和子孙幸福所应当团结一致、努力实行的方针。只有建立强大的国防力量，才能保卫祖国领土，才能保卫我们的胜利果实，才能保卫生产建设，才能粉碎帝国主义发动侵略战争的阴谋，保卫世界持久和平。只有建立强大的经济力量，才能使新中国真正富强起来，使国防建设得到充分的物质保证，使人民的生活不断上升，使帝国主义不敢冒险侵犯。所以，我们全国军民一定要拿出更高的爱国主义和革命英雄主义的精神，把毛主席的指示，变成我们的实际行动。
    全体人民解放军的同志们！你们在革命战争中树立了无数的功勋，受到了广大人民的歌颂，你们要继续发扬这种光荣传统，努力提高军事技术，学习苏联先进的军事经验，把我们的人民解放军建设成为熟悉现代作战技术与无比勇敢相结合的军队，建设成为更加强大无敌的国防军。站在国防前线的部队，要为解放台湾和西藏而坚决奋斗，要为保卫祖国的神圣领土与世界和平而坚决奋斗。我们的公安部队和民兵武装，应当积极剿灭土匪、坚决镇压一切反革命分子的活动，保护地方治安，保护一切生产建设事业。
    全国工人、职员同志们！在过去革命战争中，在保卫国家财产和争取财政经济初步好转的斗争中，你们发扬了工人阶级的觉悟性、勇敢性和革命的创造性，今后在争取国家财政经济状况的根本好转、建立强大的经济力量和国防力量的工作中，更需要发挥工人阶级的先锋作用，发扬主人翁的劳动态度，展开生产竞赛，努力学习技术，提高产量和质量，加强劳动纪律，消除一切浪费现象，减低成本，认真完成国家给予的生产任务，以促进国家的经济建设和改善我们自己的物质生活。
    全国的农民同志们！在革命战争中，在建设新中国的事业中，老解放区的农民已经显示了无限的坚毅斗争精神和强大的力量，今后应该不断地提高生产热情，实行生产互助，提高技术，精耕细作，兴修水利，植树造林，防止水灾、旱灾、虫灾，争取新的丰收。新解放区的农民同志，应该坚决执行中央人民政府颁布的土地改革法，有步骤有秩序地完成土地改革，使全体农民都摆脱受压迫、受剥削的穷困的生活，努力生产，走上自由和富裕的道路。
    我们全体代表，在此宣誓：一定要按照毛主席和中央各位首长的谆谆告戒，决不骄傲自满，决不丝毫松懈，一定要在战斗中和工作中继续努力学习，向广大群众学习，和周围的同志们亲密团结，共同执行新的伟大任务。
    我们希望：在这次全国战斗英雄和劳动模范代表会议之后，在全国展开广泛的革命英雄主义运动，继续创造更多的英雄和模范事迹，使我们的国防建设和经济建设进步更快，以便给帝国主义的侵略阴谋以更大的打击，使我们的光荣祖国——中华人民共和国日益强盛起来！
    英雄主义的人民革命事业和人民建设事业万岁！
    人民解放军的全体指战员同志们万岁！
    全中国的劳动人民同志们万岁！
    伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大的人民领袖毛主席万岁！
               一九五○年十月二日
