Xinhua News Agency, 30th -- The Chinese delegation to the Second World Peace Congress, led by head of delegation Guo Moruo, departed from Beijing at 10 PM on the 30th to go abroad. When the delegation was about to depart, all circles in Beijing held a grand farewell gathering at the station. Those present included: Central People's Government Vice Chairmen Li Jishen and Zhang Lan, Government Administration Council Vice Premier Huang Yanpei and heads of various ministries, commissions, and administrations, Vice Chairmen of the China Peace Committee Peng Zhen and Chen Shutong, Standing Committee members Situ Meitang, Li Lisan, Shen Yanbing, Shao Lizi, Hu Qiaomu, Ma Xulun, Zhang Xiruo, Xu Deheng, Liang Xi, Cai Chang, Peng Zemin, Luo Longji, Vice Mayor of Beijing Wu Han, and over a thousand representatives from various democratic parties, organs, schools, and people's organizations. Also attending the farewell were Polish Ambassador to China, Burkin, and embassy staff. The delegation entered the station amidst cheers from the well-wishers lining the road. The farewell meeting then began. Peng Zhen first delivered a farewell speech, saying: Peace is the common demand of people all over the world. The forces of peace are now the most powerful forces in the world. The people of the world will never allow the American imperialists to carry out aggression and disrupt peace. In a very short period, over 200 million people in China have signed the Stockholm Appeal, demonstrating our people's firm will to defend peace, and also showing that the Chinese people have a powerful force to defend peace. We hope that the Chinese delegation will bring this will of the Chinese people abroad, unite with peace-loving forces all over the world, and crush the conspiracies of the warmongers. We wish the delegation a successful and victorious return.

The delegation leader Guo Moruo gave a reply, saying: The delegation will certainly convey the firm will of all Chinese people to defend peace and oppose American aggression to the people of Europe and the world, and report the heroic history of the Chinese people's struggle against American imperialism to the people of the world, proving that the American imperialists are indeed paper tigers, and encourage the people of the world to unite and strive to defend world peace. He said: The delegation will certainly not fail the trust and expectations of the people of the whole country. Guo Moruo finally called on all Chinese people to unite, oppose American aggression, support Korea, and liberate Taiwan!

After delegation leader Guo Moruo finished his reply, the well-wishers presented flowers to the delegates. The delegation's special train departed amidst cheers.
