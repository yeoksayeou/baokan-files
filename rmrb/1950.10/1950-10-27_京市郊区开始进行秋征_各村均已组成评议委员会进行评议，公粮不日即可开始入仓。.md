　　Autumn Grain Collection Begins in the Suburbs of Beijing
　　Village Committees Formed for Assessment, Public Grain to Enter Warehouses Soon

　　[Report from this newspaper] According to news from the Beijing Municipal News Agency: The autumn agricultural tax collection in the suburbs of Beijing began in mid-October. Currently, each village has formed an investigation and assessment committee consisting of people from all social strata, and is carrying out democratic assessments and reasonable reductions and exemptions.

　　This autumn collection work is related to the burden of more than 370,000 agricultural population and the agricultural production of more than 1.07 million mu of land in the suburbs. The Beijing Municipal People's Government has formulated the "Supplementary Measures for the 1950 Autumn Agricultural Tax Collection in the Suburbs of Beijing" based on the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas" and the actual situation after the land reform in the suburbs; and it has been submitted to the Central People's Government for approval and implementation. Furthermore, because the summer collection in the suburbs of Beijing this year was to settle the outstanding public grain from last year, it was impossible to deduct the amount of the summer collection from each household during this autumn collection. Therefore, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, according to the ratio of agricultural tax in the suburbs of Beijing in summer and autumn this year, stipulates that the tax rate for this autumn collection is 10.95 percent; it formulates a progressive table of autumn collection tax rates, converting the starting point for taxation to 136 jin of field corn. The total autumn public grain to be collected in the entire suburb is equivalent to more than 17.04 million jin of millet, and the burden coverage for each district is stipulated to be about 95 percent of the agricultural population. It also stipulates the collection ratio: 8 percent of the total annual agricultural income for poor peasants, 15 percent for middle peasants, 20 percent for rich peasants, and the highest progressive rate does not exceed 25 percent. This is not only conducive to uniting the middle peasants and preserving the rich peasant economy; it is also beneficial to agricultural capitalists and operators of tea gardens and orchards who have advanced production equipment. In addition, since this autumn collection is based on the normal annual yield, those who increase their yields through diligent cultivation, water conservancy construction, and land improvement will not be taxed more; those who reduce their yields due to laziness will not be taxed less, which plays a role in encouraging production. For households with reduced harvests due to disasters, it is stipulated that appropriate reductions and exemptions will be given through democratic assessment and government verification under the principle of ensuring national financial revenue.

　　The Suburban Work Committee of the Municipal Government made a series of preparations in advance in order to do a good job in this autumn collection. In mid-August, it began to investigate yields together with the Finance Bureau and the Municipal Government Research Office, and the Suburban Committee sent working groups to typical villages to investigate disaster situations; and selected three typical villages to trial calculate tax rates. In mid-October, each district held farmers' representative meetings to discuss the autumn collection policy, and in conjunction with the current political situation, exposed the rumors created by special agents, and called on the vast number of farmers to actively pay public grain for the construction of our great motherland and the consolidation of the victory of land reform. The Suburban Committee and each district also held short-term training classes for autumn collection cadres one after another, learning tax laws and methods of assessing production, reducing and exempting, and calculating burdens, combined with the experience of this year's summer collection work, to study how to organize and lead the masses to resolutely implement policies, complete tasks, and overcome the work style of coercion and command. All of this has provided favorable conditions for doing a good job in autumn collection, so it is expected that the entire autumn collection work will be completed by mid-November.

　　Xinhua News Agency Correction:

　　In the news release on the 24th, "Active Native Produce Trade in Central and Southern China," the sentence "Tea production in Hunan has increased fivefold compared to last year, and has recovered to 30 percent of the highest output before the Anti-Japanese War." should be changed to "Tea production in Hunan has increased by 99 percent compared to last year, and has recovered to more than 40 percent of the highest output before the Anti-Japanese War."

　　京市郊区开始进行秋征
    各村均已组成评议委员会进行评议，公粮不日即可开始入仓。
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处消息：京市郊区秋季农业税已自本月中旬开始征收。现在各村均已组成包括各阶层人士参加的调查评议委员会，正进行民主评议，合理减免等工作。
    这次秋征工作关系着郊区三十七万余农业人口的负担和一百零七万余亩土地的农业生产。京市人民政府已根据《新解放区农业税暂行条例》与郊区土地改革后的实际情况制定了《北京市郊区一九五○年农业税秋征补充办法》；并经呈奉中央人民政府批准施行。又因京郊今年夏征系结束去年公粮尾欠，此次秋征时，无法逐户扣除夏征数目。因此，京市人民政府依照今年郊区夏、秋两季农业税比例，规定这次秋征税率为百分之十点九五；制订秋征税率累进表，将起征点折合为伏地玉米一百三十六市斤。全郊区应征秋季公粮折合小米一千七百零四万余斤，各区负担面规定为农业人口百分之九十五左右。并规定征收比率：贫农为其全年农业总收入的百分之八，中农百分之十五，富农百分之二十，最高累进不超过百分之二十五。这不但有利于团结中农，保存富农经济；且对于拥有进步生产设备的农业资本家与茶园、果木园的经营者也是有利的。此外，由于这次秋征是根据常年应产量而课征的，故对于因勤耕细作、兴修水利、改良土地等而增加收获量者，不多征收；对于因怠惰而减少收获量者也不少征，起到鼓励生产的作用。对于因灾歉收的各户，规定在保证国家财政收入的原则下，用民主评议，政府核定的办法适当予以减免。
    市府郊区工作委员会为了做好这次秋征工作，事先曾作了一系列的准备工作。于八月中旬就会同财政局、市府调查研究室等部门开始调查产量，郊委会派了工作组深入典型村调查灾情；并选择了三个典型村试算税率。十月中旬各区又分别召开农民代表会议讨论了秋征政策，并结合当前政治形势，揭破特务所造谣言，号召广大农民为建设我们伟大的祖国与巩固土地改革的胜利果实而踊跃交纳公粮。郊委会和各区并先后举办了秋征干部短期训练班，学习税法和评产、减免、计算负担等方法，结合今年夏征工作的经验，研究如何组织、领导群众坚决贯彻政策，完成任务，克服强迫命令的作风。这一切都为做好秋征工作提供了有利条件，故预计十一月中旬全部秋征工作即可完成。
　　新华社更正：
    二十四日新闻稿内《中南区土产交易活跃》一稿中，“湖南的茶叶较去年增产五倍，已恢复到抗日战争前最高产量的百分之三十。”一句应改为“湖南的茶叶较去年增产百分之九十九，已恢复到抗日战争前最高产量的百分之四十以上。”（此稿刊于十月二十六日本报第二版。）
