Xinhua News Agency, October 14th: The Central People's Government Administration Council has issued the "Decision on Governing the Huai River," the full text of which is as follows:

This year, the Huai River basin experienced extraordinarily large floods, causing severe flooding. The disaster area in Henan and Anhui provinces is estimated to be over 40 million mu, affecting 13 million people. Following Chairman Mao's directive to radically control the Huai River, the Ministry of Water Resources convened responsible cadres from the East China and Central-South China Water Resources Departments, the Huai River Water Conservancy Engineering General Bureau, and the three provinces of Henan, Northern Anhui, and Northern Jiangsu to analyze the water situation and repeatedly study and formulate a plan for governing the Huai River and the projects to be undertaken in 1951. After reporting to the Council, the following decisions were made:

(1) The guiding principle for governing the Huai River should be to combine storage and discharge to achieve the goal of radical control. In the upper reaches, reservoirs should be built and soil and water conservation should be universally promoted, with the long-term goal of controlling floods and developing water conservancy. Currently, on the one hand, we should make full use of mountain valleys and depressions to store floodwater. On the other hand, under the principle of taking care of the middle and lower reaches, appropriate flood control and dredging should be carried out. In the middle reaches, both storage and discharge should be emphasized. According to the maximum flood volume, on the one hand, lakes and depressions should be used to store floods from main and tributary rivers. On the other hand, river channels should be dredged to discharge all floodwater beyond the storage capacity. In the lower reaches, waterways to the sea should be opened to facilitate discharge, and the Grand Canal dikes should be strengthened to ensure safety. Hongze Lake will continue to be used to regulate water volume in the middle and lower reaches. Waterlogging disasters in the Huai River basin are also very serious, and attention should be paid to prevention, which should be listed as one of the key construction projects for this winter and next spring, first ensuring next year's wheat harvest.

(2) Based on the above principles, the following projects should be carried out first in 1951:

	Upper reaches: Temporary flood storage projects in low-lying areas, with a flood storage capacity exceeding 2 billion cubic meters. Dredging of the Huai, Hong, Ru, Ying, and Shuang Lei rivers, including closing breaches, restoring dikes, widening dike spacing, and dredging, to prevent flooding. Selectively carry out ditch, canal, and culvert projects in low-lying areas to meet the drainage needs during the wheat growing season. Pilot projects for ponds, dams, and check dams should be carried out first, and plans should be made for promotion. Survey and research on mountain valley reservoirs should be carried out as soon as possible to strive for early construction.

	Middle reaches: Flood storage projects in lakes and depressions, striving for a flood storage capacity of 5 billion cubic meters. Above Zhengyangguan, the main dikes of the Huai River should be designed according to the maximum flood level, closing breaches, restoring dikes, and partially retreating and rebuilding. Below Zhengyangguan, the height of the north bank dikes should be designed according to the maximum flood level. In areas where remote dikes need to be built, the top of the original dikes should be level with the 1950 flood level. The height of the south bank dikes, except for the three areas of Zhengyangguan, Bengbu, and the Huainan Coal Mine, which should be designed according to the maximum flood level, should temporarily be based on the 1931 flood level. Dredging of the silted sections of the low-water river channels of the main and tributary rivers should be carried out, taking into account the principles of the lower reaches. The Fuyang and Suxian Special Zones should selectively open up ditches and canals and build culverts to meet the drainage needs during the wheat growing season. Flood storage and river dredging in the upper reaches of the Huai River should be carried out in coordination.

	Lower reaches: Immediately carry out projects such as opening waterways to the sea, strengthening the dikes of the Grand Canal, and constructing the Sanhe movable dam. The waterway to the sea is a huge project. The first phase of the project should be completed in 1951, and water should be released during the flood season in 1952. Before the waterway to the sea is opened for water release, the waterway to the Yangtze River will still be temporarily used as the tail end of the drainage. The maximum discharge from Hongze Lake into the Yangtze River is temporarily set at 8,500 cubic meters per second. In the event of simultaneous rises in the Yangtze and Huai rivers and excessively high water levels, the return-to-sea dam will still be opened to ensure the safety of the canal dikes. Partial dredging projects for the canal into the Yangtze River and the inland river harbor channel into the sea should also be carried out in coordination.

(3) To ensure the safety of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, the design, construction, priority, and urgency of the above projects must be coordinated and mutually supportive. Therefore, flood storage projects in the upper and middle reaches should be carried out as soon as possible, given technical and preparatory possibilities, and efforts should be made to increase flood storage capacity. The waterway to the sea in the lower reaches should be completed as soon as possible, and the distribution of flow into the Yangtze River and the sea should be studied and determined based on long-term interests to avoid unnecessary waste in temporary projects. The estimation of flood flow in the main and tributary rivers should also continue to collect data and carry out more accurate calculations to ensure the economy and safety of various projects.

(4) To strengthen unified leadership and implement the policy of governing the Huai River, the Huai River governance organization should be strengthened. Based on the existing Huai River Water Conservancy Engineering General Bureau, a Huai River Management Committee should be established, with representatives appointed by the East China and Central-South Military and Political Committees and the relevant provincial and regional people's governments to uniformly lead the work of governing the Huai River. The director, deputy director, and committee members will be appointed by the Government Administration Council. Under the committee, three provincial and regional headquarters for governing the Huai River will be established in Henan, Northern Anhui, and Northern Jiangsu. In addition, three engineering bureaus for the upper, middle, and lower reaches will be established, which will participate in the various headquarters as components.

(5) Regarding project funding, no decision will be made for the time being. The Huai River Management Committee should, together with various regions, conduct supplementary surveys and measurements as soon as possible based on actual conditions, and be responsible for submitting realistic and reliable project plans and financial plans, which should be jointly signed by the heads of local administrative organs and water conservancy organs and submitted to the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government for review and approval by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council. Reasonable regulations must be made for the unit price of earthwork in order to improve efficiency and avoid waste.

(6) The implementation of all Huai River governance plans and projects is aimed at radically controlling Huai River floods. The projects this winter and next spring should be combined with work-for-relief and disaster relief work, ensuring project standards and completing project tasks. For important projects that are closely related to the upper and lower reaches or are technically complex, construction must be started only after inspection, design, and approval in accordance with the foregoing regulations. As for local projects within the scope of the radical control plan, the Huai River Management Committee and the people's governments of various regions can be entrusted to negotiate and implement them first. To meet the current need for work-for-relief, a portion of food and funds may be allocated first.

　　确保豫皖苏三省不受淮河水灾
    政务院发布根治淮河决定
    上中下游按不同情况实施蓄泄兼筹方针
    拟定明年应办工程设治淮委会统一领导
    【新华社十四日讯】中央人民政府政务院发布《关于治理淮河的决定》，全文如下：
    今年淮河流域，因洪水特大，造成严重水灾，豫皖境内受灾面积，约略估计达四千余万亩，灾民一千三百万人。遵照毛主席根治淮河的指示，由水利部召集华东区与中南区水利部，淮河水利工程总局，及河南、皖北、苏北三省区负责干部，分析水情，反复研讨，拟定治理淮河方针及一九五一年应办的工程，经向本院汇报后，决定如下：
    （一）关于治理淮河的方针，应蓄泄兼筹，以达根治之目的。上游应筹建水库，普遍推行水土保持，以拦蓄洪水发展水利为长远目标，目前则应一方面尽量利用山谷及洼地拦蓄洪水，一方面在照顾中下游的原则下，进行适当的防洪与疏浚。中游蓄泄并重，按照最大洪水来量，一方面利用湖泊洼地，拦蓄干支洪水，一方面整理河槽，承泄拦蓄以外的全部洪水。下游开阔入海水道，以利宣泄，同时巩固运河堤防，以策安全。洪泽湖仍作为中下游调节水量之用。淮河流域，内涝成灾，亦至严重，应同时注意防止，并列为今冬明春施工重点之一，首先保障明年的麦收。
    （二）根据上述的方针，一九五一年应先行举办下列的工程：
    上游，低洼地区临时蓄洪工程，蓄洪量应超过二十亿公方。整理淮、洪、汝、颍、双泪各河河道，包括堵口复堤，放宽堤距及疏浚，以防泛滥。低洼地区配合麦作期排水需要，择要举办沟洫涵闸工程。塘坝谷坊，先行试办，筹划推广。山谷水库尽速进行测勘研究，争取早日兴工。
    中游，湖泊洼地蓄洪工程，蓄洪量应争取五十亿公文。正阳关以上，淮河干堤，按最大洪水设计，堵口复堤，部分退建。正阳关以下，北堤高度应按最大洪水设计，在必要修筑遥堤地段，其原堤堤顶高度平于一九五○年洪水位。南堤堤顶高度，除正阳关、蚌埠、淮南煤矿三地区，应按最大洪水设计外，其余暂以平于一九三一年洪水位为原则。干支流低水河槽的淤塞部分，在照顾下游原则下，进行疏浚。阜阳宿县两专区配合麦作期排水需要，择要开辟沟洫，修建涵闸。淮河上游蓄洪及整理河道，应配合同时举办。
    下游应即进行开辟入海水道，加强运河堤防，及建筑三河活动坝等工程。入海水道工程浩大，一九五一年先完成第一期工程，一九五二年汛期放水。在入海水道辟成放水前，仍暂以入江水道为泄水尾闾，洪泽湖入江最高泄量暂以八千五百秒公方为度。万一如遇江淮并涨，水位过高，仍开归海坝，以保运堤安全。运河入江水道及里下河入海港道部分疏浚工程，亦应配合举办。
    （三）为确保豫皖苏三省的安全，上述各项工程的设计施工，与先后缓急，均须作到互相配合，互相照顾。因此上中游蓄洪工程，应就技术与准备的可能，尽速举办，并争取增加蓄洪容量。下游入海水道，应早日完成选线设计，并根据长远利益，研究确定入江入海流量之分配，以避免临时性工程中发生不必要的浪费。关于干支各河洪水流量之估计，亦应继续搜集资料，进行更为精确的推算，以求各项工程的经济与安全。
    （四）为加强统一领导，贯彻治淮方针，应加强治淮机构，以现有淮河水利工程总局为基础，成立治淮委员会，由华东、中南两军政委员会及有关省、区人民政府指派代表参加，统一领导治淮工作，主任、副主任及委员人选由政务院任命，下分设河南、皖北、苏北三省、区治淮指挥部。另设上、中、下游三工程局，分别参加各指挥部为其组成部分。
    （五）关于工程经费，目前暂时不作决定，应由治淮委员会会同各地区，尽速根据实际情况，补充勘测，负责提出切实可靠之工程计划与财务计划，并由地方行政机关及水利机关负责人共同签字，经中央人民政府水利部转请政务院财政经济委员会核定。土方单价尤须作合理规定，以求提高效率，避免浪费。
    （六）全部治淮计划与工程的实施，皆以根治淮河水灾为目的，今冬明春的工程，应在保证工程标准与完成工程任务的条件下，以工代赈，与救灾工作相结合。凡属重要的，上、下游密切相关的，或技术性较高的工程，均须依照前项规定，经过查勘设计于批准后再行动工。至于局部性的工程，在根治计划范围以内者，可以责成治淮委员会及各地区人民政府商定后先行施工。为配合当前以工代赈需要，并可先拨一部粮款。
                一九五○年十月十四日
