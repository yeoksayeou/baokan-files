Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The People's Armed Forces of the East China Military Region, with a ten-year history of struggle, have now grown to 1,072,417 people. Self-defense forces and other armed organizations were established in Shandong Province and the Subei Administrative Office under the region's jurisdiction in the early and mid-stages of the Anti-Japanese War, and militia were widely developed after 1942. The militia in the vast new areas such as Zhejiang and Fujian were built up during the suppression of bandits, opposition to local bullies, and rent reduction struggles after the complete liberation of the mainland of East China.

During the Anti-Japanese War, the East China militia cooperated with the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army to launch extensive guerrilla warfare, and persisted in and developed the anti-Japanese base areas. The mass landmine warfare launched in Shandong killed and wounded a large number of enemies, which became an important combat method for the militia. Their slogans were: "Guarantee the enemy will be bombed every time they pass!" "Where the enemy comes from, bomb them there!" The militia of Wenshanhou, Zhao Quan, and Xiaotan three villages in Haiyang County, Jiaodong, detonated 118 landmines in a month and a half of fighting against enemy and puppet sweeps, of which 92 landmines killed and wounded 258 enemy and puppet troops. During the Liberation War, the militia did their best to support the front line and actively participated in the People's Liberation Army. In the Bohai area of Shandong alone, more than 170,000 militia members served as stretcher bearers, transporters, and participated in the military's long marches. More than 300,000 militia members in Subei participated in the People's Liberation Army. According to statistics from some units in Shandong that were upgraded from local armed forces to field armies, militia members accounted for 80% of the recruits. In addition, the militia fought bravely countless times against the Chiang bandit army equipped with American weapons. The three million people in Rugao, Taizhou, Taixing, and Jingjiang counties in Subei launched a large-scale armed self-defense movement with the militia as the backbone. The Dongjun Militia Joint Defense Team, active in Dingnian and Dongchen areas of Rugao, fought 38 battles in one month, and the enemies they attacked totaled more than 5,000 people. The Hedong Township Militia of the Huaiyin Sub-district created a model of combining labor and military affairs. Each plow was equipped with a militiaman with a gun. In the event of enemy activity, they immediately gathered to fight, covering the masses' evacuation and leading away cattle.

Some areas in East China have now begun to further build up the militia. After the Subei Military Region held a military construction meeting in March this year, it conducted work such as reviewing the militia, rectifying organizations, and registering firearms. They absorbed a large number of party members, Youth League members, and activists from peasant associations as the leading backbone of the militia, and purged landlords, bullies, hooligans, and other bad elements who had infiltrated the militia. Some sub-districts and counties also conducted short-term training for militia cadres.

Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The Northwest Military Region's militia now numbers 335,950 people. In old areas such as Shaanxi and Gansu in the region, the militia are continuing to consolidate and develop on the existing basis. In new areas such as Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Ningxia, militia organizations have begun to be established and developed during various social reform movements.

During the Anti-Japanese War, the Northwest People's Armed Forces played a major role in protecting their homes and fields, opposing local bullies, protecting highways, and assisting the army in breaking the Kuomintang reactionaries' blockade and encirclement. During the Liberation War, they actively supported the front line, carrying out logistical and transportation work. After the liberation of the entire Northwest region, the militia widely participated in the struggle to wipe out bandits and eliminate secret agents. Closely integrated with the masses, they implemented village-to-village, district-to-district, and county-to-county joint defense, and established checkpoints on important transportation lines. Once bandits and secret agents were discovered, they immediately tracked them down. According to incomplete statistics, the militia in Xianyang, Weinan, Baoji and other places annihilated more than 400 scattered bandits and seized 1,400 rifles during the autumn bandit suppression. The Xianyang Sub-district Militia assisted the People's Liberation Army Public Security Forces in solving 83 bandit cases and one secret agent case. They also often exposed the reactionary rumors and sabotage plots of bandits, secret agents, and feudal secret societies such as Yiguandao. Zhang Fusheng, the militia company commander of Yinchuan County, assisted the public security organs in uncovering a conspiracy to riot and arrested 23 counter-revolutionaries.

Currently, under the slogan of "Preventing bandits and defending ourselves," the Northwest militia are conducting propaganda and mobilization work, and are currently focusing on organized reconnaissance and suppression of remnant bandits and secret agents.

　　华东西北人民武装巩固发展
    两区民兵目前已发展到一百四十万人
    广大新区民兵组织已在社会改革运动中建设起来
    【新华社二十六日讯】具有十年斗争历史的华东军区人民武装，目前已发展到一百零七万二千四百十七人。该区所属山东省和苏北行署在抗战初期和中期即已建立自卫队等武装组织，至一九四二年后普遍发展了民兵。而浙江、福建等广大新区的民兵，则是在华东大陆全部解放后进行剿匪，反恶霸和减租斗争中建设起来的。
    华东民兵在抗日战争中，配合八路军、新四军展开了广泛的游击战争，坚持和发展了抗日根据地。在山东展开的群众性的地雷爆破战，大量地杀伤了敌人，这曾成为民兵重要的战斗手段。他们的口号是：“保证敌人走一趟、炸一趟！”“敌人从那里来，就往那里炸！”胶东海阳县文山后、赵辁、小滩三个村的民兵，曾在一个半月反敌伪扫荡的战斗中，爆响地雷一百十八个，其中九十二个地雷共毙伤敌伪二百五十八名。在解放战争中，民兵尽力支援前线，并踊跃地参加人民解放军。仅山东渤海区担任担架、运输和随军长征的民兵即达十七万人以上。苏北有三十多万民兵参加了人民解放军。据山东由地方武装升级为野战军中的某些部队统计，在参军成份中民兵占到百分之八十。此外，民兵并与美械装备的蒋匪军进行了无数次的英勇作战。苏北如皋、泰州、泰兴、靖江四个县三百万人民，曾以民兵为骨干展开了大规模的武装自卫运动。活跃在如皋丁埝、东陈一带的东骏民兵联防队，在一个月内作战三十八次，被他们打击的敌人共达五千人以上。淮阴分区河东乡民兵创造了劳武结合的范例，他们每张犁配备一个带枪民兵，发生敌情马上集合作战，掩护群众转移和牵走耕牛。
    华东部分地区目前已开始了进一步建设民兵的工作。苏北军区于今年三月召开建军会议后即进行了审查民兵、整顿组织和登记枪枝等工作。他们吸收了大批党员、青年团员和农会的积极分子为民兵的领导骨干，清洗了混入民兵中的地主、恶霸、流氓等不良分子。某些分区和县份并进行了民兵干部的短期训练。
    【新华社二十六日讯】西北军区民兵武装目前已有三十三万五千九百五十人。该区陕西、甘肃等老区民兵在现有的基础上正继续求得巩固和发展，新疆、青海、宁夏等新区则在各项社会改革运动中，开始建立和发展民兵组织。
    西北人民武装在抗日战争时期，在保乡保田、反对恶霸、保护公路和协助军队粉碎国民党反动派封锁围困等方面起了重大作用。在解放战争中他们积极支援前线，进行补给、运输等项战勤工作。西北全境解放后，民兵广泛地参加了清剿土匪和肃清特务的斗争。他们在和群众密切结合之下，实行村村联防、区区联防和县县联防，并在重要交通线上建立了盘查哨站，一旦发现土匪特务，便马上跟踪追击。据不完全统计，咸阳、渭南、宝鸡等地民兵在秋季剿匪中，共计歼灭散匪四百多名，缴获步枪一千四百枝。咸阳分区民兵协助人民解放军公安部队，破获盗匪案八十三件、特务案一件。他们并经常揭穿土匪、特务及封建会门一贯道的反动造谣和破坏阴谋。银川县民兵连长张福生曾协助公安机关破获了阴谋暴动案，逮捕了二十三名反革命分子。
    目前西北民兵在“防匪自卫”的口号下，除进行宣传动员工作外，目前正在各地有重点地有组织地侦察和扑灭残余土匪和特务的活动。
