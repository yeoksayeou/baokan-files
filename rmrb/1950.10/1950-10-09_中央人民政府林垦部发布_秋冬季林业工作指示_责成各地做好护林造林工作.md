Xinhua News Agency, 5th: The Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central People's Government recently issued instructions "Regarding Autumn and Winter Forestry Work," tasking all regions with doing a good job in forest protection and afforestation during the autumn and winter seasons, to further complete and exceed this year's forestry work tasks and prepare conditions for next year's forestry work.

The instructions first stipulate that all regions must strengthen forest protection work. Governments at all levels should list preventing wildfires as one of their important tasks, and must promptly convene cadre meetings and mass meetings to arrange fire prevention work, rectify and strengthen fire prevention organizations, and at the same time send capable cadres to conduct supervision and inspection separately, to reduce or avoid forest fires. At the same time, local people's governments must grasp the correct production policy and forest protection policy, prevent the masses from indiscriminately felling trees, so as not to damage the forests and cause agricultural disasters of waterlogging, drought, wind, and sand. As for when the masses in certain areas must enter the mountains to engage in other sideline occupations (such as collecting herbs, hunting, cutting grass, etc.), local governments must also organize them well and formulate forest protection covenants that the masses unanimously abide by. All regions should strengthen the protection of newly planted trees this year to consolidate the results. Again, in the old liberated areas, winter leisure should be used, and in the new liberated areas, the land reform or rent reduction work should be coordinated to conduct a planned clearing of forest rights and wasteland rights, and strict prevention should be taken against landlords and lawless elements taking the opportunity to destroy forests.

Regarding autumn afforestation work, the instructions pointed out: It is easy for trees to survive after the leaves fall and before the ground freezes, and the farmers are relatively free, which are all favorable conditions for afforestation. Therefore, governments at all levels should actively mobilize the masses to launch the autumn afforestation movement during this period, and seize the opportunity to complete seed collection and autumn and winter seedling cultivation work, and plan and prepare for next year's afforestation and seedling cultivation work.

　　中央人民政府林垦部发布
    秋冬季林业工作指示
    责成各地做好护林造林工作
    【新华社五日讯】中央人民政府林垦部近发布“关于秋、冬季林业工作”的指示，责成各地做好秋、冬两季的护林、造林工作，以进一步完成和超过本年林业工作任务，并给明年林业工作准备条件。
    指示首先规定各地必须加强护林工作。各级政府应将防止野火列为重要任务之一，必须及时召开干部会议和群众会议，布置防火工作，整顿与加强防火组织，同时派出得力干部分头进行督促检查，以减少或避免森林火灾。同时各地人民政府必须掌握正确的生产政策和护林政策，防止群众滥肆砍伐林木，以免使森林遭受破坏，造成农业上水旱风沙的灾害。至于某些地区群众必须入山搞其他副业时（如采药、打猎，割草等），各地政府也必须很好地加以组织，并订出群众一致遵守的护林公约。各地应对今年新植林木加强保护，以巩固成果。再次，在老解放区应利用冬闲，在新解放区应配合土地改革或减租工作有计划地进行对于林权和荒地权的清理工作，并应严防地主不法分子乘机破坏森林。
    关于秋季造林工作，指示指出：树木落叶后至大地冻结以前，造林容易成活，加以农民比较空闲，这些都是造林的有利条件。因此各地政府应在此一时期，积极地发动群众展开秋季造林运动，并抓紧完成采种和秋冬育苗工作，筹划和准备明年造林和育苗工作。
