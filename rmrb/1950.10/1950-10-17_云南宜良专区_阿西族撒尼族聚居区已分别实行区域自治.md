Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 9th. Regional autonomy has been implemented in areas inhabited by the Axi and Sani ethnic groups in Yiliang Prefecture, Yunnan. In the Xishan District of Mile County, under the jurisdiction of Yiliang Prefecture, the Axi people account for more than 70 percent of the total population of over 66,000 residents. Before liberation, five Han Chinese townships and towns were divided between Mile and Lunan counties. The Guishan District, inhabited by 30,000 Sani people, was also divided and administered by four counties: Lunan, Luliang, Luxi, and Mile.

For decades, the people of the Axi and Sani ethnic groups lived in extreme hardship under the dark rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. In March 1948, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the Axi and Sani ethnic groups first launched armed uprisings in Xishan and Guishan, organizing their own armed force - the First Column of the Yunnan People's Anti-Chiang Self-Salvation Army. After liberation, in February 1949, the people's district governments of the two ethnic groups were established in Xishan and Guishan. The Yunnan Provincial People's Government approved the incorporation of Xishan District into Mile County, and Guishan District into Lunan County. Axi ethnic combat hero Long Jieren and Sani ethnic mass leader Huang Enpei were elected by the people of the two ethnic groups as chairmen of the Xishan and Guishan District People's Governments, respectively. The majority of the power organs at all levels in the two districts are composed of Axi and Sani ethnic personnel, and people from other ethnic groups have also been absorbed to participate.

After Xishan and Guishan districts gained autonomy, the Axi, Sani, and other ethnic groups have become more closely united.

　　云南宜良专区
    阿西族撒尼族聚居区已分别实行区域自治
    【新华社重庆九日电】云南宜良专区阿西族和撒尼族聚居的地区，已实行区域自治。宜良专区所属弥勒县的西山区，阿西族占全部居民六万六千余人的百分之七十以上。解放前被分属于弥勒、路南两县的五个汉族乡和镇。有三万撒尼族的圭山区，亦被分割为路南、陆良、泸西、弥勒等四县管辖。
    几十年来，阿西、撒尼两族的人民，在蒋匪帮的黑暗统治下，生活极其困苦。一九四八年三月阿西和撒尼两族的人民在中国共产党领导下，首先在西山、圭山两地武装起义，组织了两族人民自己的武装——云南人民讨蒋自救军第一纵队。解放后，一九四九年的二月，西山、圭山即建立了两族人民的区人民政府。云南省人民政府并批准将西山区划归弥勒县，圭山区归属路南县管辖。并由两族人民分别选举了阿西族战斗英雄龙介仁、撒尼族群众领袖黄恩培为西山、圭山两个区人民政府的主席。两区所有各级的政权机构，大部分由阿西、撒尼两族人员组成，并吸收了其他民族的人士参加。
    西山、圭山两区获得自治后，阿西、撒尼等各族人民更加亲密团结。
