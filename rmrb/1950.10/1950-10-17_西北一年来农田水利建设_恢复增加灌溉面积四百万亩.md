Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an. Significant achievements have been made in farmland irrigation construction in Northwest China over the past year. In the five provinces of the region, the irrigated area has been expanded by more than 700,000 mu, old irrigated farmland has been restored by more than 1.5 million mu, and 2.3 million mu of old irrigated land has been guaranteed, totaling more than 4 million mu of increased and restored farmland irrigation area. More than 100,000 People's Liberation Army soldiers participated in the large-scale canal construction project in Xinjiang Province, which was liberated later, enabling the rapid recovery and development of agricultural production in the Northwest.

The Northwest region has high terrain and sparse rainfall, with an average annual rainfall of only 200 to 500 mm throughout the region. In individual areas, such as Hotan and Turpan in Xinjiang, the annual rainfall is only about 20 mm, and the Hexi Corridor in Gansu is no more than 50 to 60 mm, while the rainfall required for general crops is more than 400 mm. Therefore, constructing canals for irrigation has become the primary task of water conservancy in the Northwest region. With the liberation of the Great Northwest, the people's governments at all levels in the Northwest first paid attention to this work.

In Shaanxi Province, the Luohe Canal, which was delayed for 16 years without water being released under the Kuomintang rule, was repaired by the people's government shortly after the liberation of Xi'an last October, mobilizing more than 5,000 engineering technicians and workers. Water was successfully released at the end of April this year, which can irrigate 100,000 mu of cotton fields and autumn crops. In addition, the Han-Hui, Bao-Hui, and Xu-Hui canals in southern Shaanxi, and the Weaver Girl Canal and Ding-Hui Canal in northern Shaanxi have also been repaired, ensuring the irrigation benefits of 300,000 mu of rice fields in northern Shaanxi and more than 3,000 mu of dry land in southern Shaanxi. In the Guanzhong area, although the Jing, Wei, Lao, Mei, Hei, and Li canals were affected by the drought this year, they still expanded the irrigated area by 350,000 mu. In Chang'an, Lintong, Weinan, Xianyang and other places, the people's government has focused on lending more than 400 new-style waterwheels. In Ningxia Province, under the leadership of the provincial people's government, the people of various places have basically broken the past system of using canals as management units this spring, and changed it to a management organization combined with the administrative system to strengthen leadership. At the same time, more than 24,600 civilians were mobilized to renovate and expand 2,068 large and small canals in 24 days, ensuring that 2.2 million mu of farmland in the province would not be threatened by drought. The newly built Funong Canal project has been 92 percent completed, and the Mountain Water Ditch Drainage project has been fully completed.

In Gansu Province, the underground water project of Shandan Touba and the Jingfeng, Huang-Hui, and other canals were completed by the end of May. The underground water in Jiuquan Bianwan and the renovation project of the old Huangyang River Canal have completed more than 60 to 95 percent of the entire project, adding 60,000 mu of new paddy fields except for the Huangyang River.

In Qinghai Province, the Liberation, Peace, Ping'an, and People (Ge Gong) canals have been completed, expanding the irrigation area by 27,000 mu, together with the Qingkai and other five canals, irrigating a total of 115,500 mu.

In Xinjiang Province, due to the participation of more than 100,000 People's Liberation Army soldiers, 32 canals including the Dihua Xia Si Gong Canal, the Shawan Xin Sheng and Taiping canals, the Xiao Guai Canal, the Korla Unity Canal, the Kuqa Se Xin Zhuang Canal, and the Aksu Dolan Canal have been newly completed within half a year, and old canals in Kashi, Shache, Ili, Hotan, Hami and other places have been renovated, which can increase the irrigated area by more than 1.27 million mu. It is estimated that the output of spring wheat, rice, and miscellaneous grains can be increased by more than 114.4 million jin, and the output of ginned cotton can be increased by more than 12,500 dan.

　　西北一年来农田水利建设
    恢复增加灌溉面积四百万亩
    【新华社西安电】西北地区的农田水利建设，一年来成绩很大。全区五省在这一年中扩充了灌田面积七十余万亩，恢复旧灌农田一百五十余万亩，并保证旧灌田二百三十万亩，合计共增加和恢复农田灌溉的面积在四百万亩以上。十多万人民解放军参加了解放较晚的新疆省的大规模修渠工程，更使西北农业生产得以迅速地恢复和发展。
    西北地势高亢，雨量稀少，全区每年平均降雨量仅二百至五百公厘。个别地区，如新疆和阗、吐鲁蕃一带，年降雨量仅二十余公厘，甘肃河西走廊亦不过五十至六十公厘，而一般农作物所需雨量却在四百公厘以上。因此，修渠灌田成为西北地区水利事业上的首要任务。随着大西北的解放，西北各地人民政府首先注意了这项工作。
    陕西省，在国民党统治时代拖延了十六年未曾放水的洛惠渠，在去年十月西安解放不久，人民政府就动员五千多工程技术人员和工人进行修复，今年四月底已成功放水，可灌溉十万亩棉田、秋禾。此外，陕南的汉惠、褒惠、湑惠三渠，陕北的织女渠及定惠渠亦已修复，保证了陕北三十万亩稻田及陕南三千余亩旱地的灌溉利益。关中地区的泾、渭、涝、梅、黑、澧等渠，虽然受今年天旱的影响，仍扩大灌田面积三十五万亩。在长安、临潼、渭南、咸阳等地，人民政府曾有重点地贷放了四百余辆新式水车。在宁夏省，各地人民在该省人民政府的领导下，今春已基本上将过去以渠道作管理单位的系统打破，改为与行政系统相结合的管理机构，以加强领导。同时，还动员了二万四千六百多民工，在二十四天内整理与增修了大小渠道二千零六十八处，保证了该省二百二十万亩农田不受干旱的威胁。新修的扶农渠工程已完成百分之九十二，山水沟排水工程已全部完成。
    在甘肃省，山丹头坝地下水工程及靖丰、湟惠等渠，在五月底时即已修筑完成。酒泉边湾地下水及黄羊河旧渠整理工程已完成全部工程的百分之六十至九十五以上，除黄羊河外新增水田六万亩。
    在青海省，解放、和平、平安、人民（阁公）等渠已修筑完成，计扩充灌溉面积二万七千亩，连同庆凯等五渠共灌田十一万五千五百亩。
    在新疆省，由于十多万人民解放军参加工作，在半年之内迪化下四工渠、沙湾新盛、太平两渠、小拐渠、库尔勒团结渠、库车色新庄渠、阿克苏多浪渠等共三十二道已新修完成，并有喀什、莎车、伊犁、和阗、哈密等处的旧渠道经过整理，共可增加灌田面积一百二十七万余亩，估计可增产春麦水稻杂粮一亿一千四百余万斤，皮棉一万二千五百余担。
