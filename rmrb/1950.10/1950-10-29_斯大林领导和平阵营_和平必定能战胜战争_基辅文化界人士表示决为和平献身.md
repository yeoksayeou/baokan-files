Xinhua News Agency, Kiev, 23rd TASS Dispatch: Cultural figures in Kiev gathered on the 22nd to hear a report on the achievements of the Second All-Soviet Union Congress in Defense of Peace. Scientists, writers, artists, engineers, teachers, and doctors filled the Ukrainian National Concert Hall. At the center of the stage was a huge portrait of Stalin, the leader and teacher of the working people of the world. Bright red banners bore the slogans: "Defending Peace is the Cause of All Peoples."

The poet Tychyna, who attended the Second All-Soviet Union Congress in Defense of Peace, delivered the opening remarks, saying: The Second All-Soviet Union Congress in Defense of Peace vividly demonstrates how great the spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people is, and how closely the Soviet people are united around the Lenin-Stalin Party. Everyone knows the role played by cultural figures in the struggle for peace. We scientists, writers, and artists must dedicate ourselves to the cause of striving for peace. Peace will surely triumph over war, because the Soviet people, led by the Bolshevik Party and the great Stalin, constitute the bulwark of world peace!

Stalin Prize winner, poet Malyshko, reported on the work of the Second All-Soviet Union Congress in Defense of Peace, stating: The delegates attending the congress demonstrated great unity when speaking in Moscow, the capital of our motherland. Representing millions of Soviet people, they showed the world the indomitable will of the Soviet people for peace, labor, and life. We are convinced that peace will surely triumph over war, because Stalin, the leader of all working people, is leading the powerful camp of peace advocates.

The audience listened attentively to the speech delivered by Turcyna, a meritorious teacher of the Ukrainian Republic. She said: People, rise up to defend peace! When I hear these lyrics, my heart is filled with joy, because my motherland stands at the forefront of the world's peace fighters.

The famous writer Vasilevska spoke, saying: The Second All-Soviet Union Congress in Defense of Peace was held in Moscow for three days. The voice of our entire country calls out: Defend world peace! When the American lynching laws persecute people merely because their skin is not white, when ambitious plotters of world hegemony are destroying the cities of the Korean people and the monuments of Korean culture, and slaughtering the old, weak, women and children, the peoples of all nationalities in the Soviet Union are holding a congress, from Kamchatka to the Bug River, and the peoples of all nationalities in the Soviet Union are declaring their support for peace. Those people who created socialist wealth with their own hands attended the congress and shouted their support for peace. We are not alone in the struggle for peace. The peace camp is expanding day by day, and under the leadership of the Communist Party and Comrade Stalin, we will defend world peace.

The conference unanimously adopted a resolution supporting Stalin's peaceful foreign policy and fully endorsing the mandate adopted at the Second All-Soviet Union Congress in Defense of Peace for the Soviet delegates to the Second World Peace Congress. The cultural figures of Kiev called on all progressive cultural figures in the world to dedicate all their energy to the struggle for peace.

The conference passed a congratulatory telegram to Comrade Stalin with great enthusiasm.

　　斯大林领导和平阵营  和平必定能战胜战争
    基辅文化界人士表示决为和平献身
    【新华社讯】塔斯社基辅二十三日电：基辅文化界人士于二十二日集会，听取关于第二届全苏拥护和平大会的工作成绩的报告。科学家、作家、艺术家、工程师、教师和医师们，在乌克兰国立音乐会演奏厅中济济一堂。舞台中央是世界劳动人民的领袖和导师、斯大林的巨幅画像。鲜红的标语牌上写着警句：“保卫和平是世界各族人民的事业”。
    出席第二届全苏拥护和平大会的诗人蒂奇纳致开会辞称：第二届全苏拥护和平大会，生动地表现出苏联人民的精神和政治上的团结多么伟大，苏联人民多么紧密地集合在列宁——斯大林党的周围。文化界人士在为和平而斗争中所起的作用，是大家都知道的。我们科学家、作家、艺术家们，必须为争取和平的事业而献身。和平必将战胜战争，因为由布尔什维克党、由伟大的斯大林领导着的苏联人民构成了世界和平的堡垒！
    斯大林奖金得奖人、诗人马利施科，报告第二届全苏拥护和平大会的工作称：出席大会的代表们，在我们祖国的首都莫斯科发言时表现出伟大的一致。他们代表千百万苏联人民，对全世界显示出苏联人民对和平、劳动与生命的不屈不挠的意志。我们确信和平必将战胜战争，因为一切劳动人民的领袖斯大林在领导着和平拥护者的强大阵营。
    会众全神灌注地倾听了乌克兰共和国功勋教师图尔契娜发表的演说。她说：人民，起来保卫和平！当我听见这些歌词的时候，我的心中就充满了喜悦，因为我的祖国站在世界和平斗士的先锋队里。
    名作家华西列夫斯卡发言称：第二届全苏拥护和平大会在莫斯科开了三天会。我们全国的呼声号召：保卫全世界的和平！当美国滥用私刑的法律仅仅因为人们的肤色不白就横加迫害的时候，当僭望世界霸权的野心家在毁灭朝鲜人民的城市和朝鲜文化的纪念碑、在屠杀老弱妇孺的时候，苏联的各族人民却在开着大会从堪察加到布格河，苏联全国各族人民，都声言拥护和平。亲手创造社会主义财富的那些人民，出席了这次大会，也都高呼拥护和平。在为和平而斗争中，我们并不是孤独的。和平阵营一天比一天扩大，在共产党和斯大林同志领导下，我们将保卫全世界的和平。
    大会一致通过决议，拥护斯大林和平外交政策，完全赞成第二届全苏拥护和平大会上所通过的给出席第二届世界和平大会的苏联代表们的委托书。基辅文化界人士号召全世界一切进步的文化人贡献出全部精力为和平而斗争。
