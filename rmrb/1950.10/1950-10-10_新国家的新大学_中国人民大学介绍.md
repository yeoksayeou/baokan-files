　　A New University for a New Nation
    ——An Introduction to Renmin University of China

    With Marxism-Leninism as its guiding ideology for teaching, Renmin University of China has pointed out a new direction for the people's higher education in the new China.

    On October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China was founded, and the great construction work of the new nation began. In order to meet the needs of national construction, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government passed a resolution at its eleventh session on December 16, 1949, to establish Renmin University of China. It would accept the advanced construction experience of the Soviet Union and hire Soviet professors to systematically and methodically train various construction cadres for the new nation. Subsequently, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government made a decision on the implementation plan for Renmin University of China on December 19. A preparatory committee for Renmin University of China was formed, consisting of Lu Dingyi, Wu Yuzhang, Qian Junrui, and Cheng Fangwu, among others. With the strong assistance of the relevant departments of the Central People's Government and Soviet experts Fesenko and Filippov, several months of preparatory work were carried out, drafting the school's organization, curriculum, and teaching organization methods. In early 1950, the school began to recruit undergraduate students from all over the country, and the various undergraduate departments began classes on March 1. By the summer vacation of this year, most of the Soviet professors hired by the school had arrived to assist in formulating the complete education plans for the undergraduate departments and specialized courses. The specialized courses also began recruiting students nationwide during the summer vacation. Currently, the undergraduate departments began classes on September 1, and the specialized courses began classes on September 29. The school held its official opening ceremony on October 3.

    The target students for Renmin University of China are primarily workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres who have participated in work for a certain number of years and possess a considerable level of education, and progressive workers with a certain amount of work experience and education. Secondly, they are progressive young intellectuals. The school currently has over 3,000 students (including undergraduate, specialized courses, and cultural supplementary classes), among whom there are 1,827 worker, peasant, and revolutionary cadres (570 with more than eight years of work history) and 172 progressive workers. Of all students, 1,733 are members of the Communist Party of China, and 651 are members of the New Democratic Youth League. Students generally have a high level of class consciousness and regard studying at Renmin University of China as a revolutionary task to learn skills to better serve the people. They can consciously and actively abide by the study organization and study plan, and wholeheartedly strive to learn. In particular, the students of the Factory Management Department, which has the most progressive workers, demonstrated a high degree of diligence in their studies during the period from March to July of this year. They not only overcame the difficulties of a lower educational level but also became the best-performing department in the entire school. Currently, the undergraduate program has eight departments: Economic Planning, Finance, Trade, Cooperation, Factory Management, Law, Diplomacy, and Russian. The length of study for each department is three years, except for Law and Diplomacy, which are four years. The specialized courses currently have eleven classes: Cooperative, Statistics, Domestic Trade, Foreign Trade, Economic Planning, Finance, Factory Management, History and Geography, Education, Law, and Diplomacy. The length of study for each class is eight months.

    The educational policy of Renmin University of China is to combine teaching with practice and Soviet experience with the Chinese situation. According to this policy, all educational cadres of the school must regularly engage in certain scientific research work around teaching to continuously improve their scientific level, teaching quality, and teaching effectiveness. Therefore, one of the organizational characteristics of the school is that, in addition to the academic affairs department, which is the general teaching and administrative leadership organ of universities, there is also a research department. The research department is responsible for leading the school's scientific research work. Its specific tasks are: organizing the scientific research work of each teaching and research office; checking the scientific research work plans of each person in each teaching and research office; leading the continuous improvement of teachers' ideological and theoretical levels and the training of graduate students; and organizing and leading the compilation, translation, and publication of teaching materials and reference materials. The research department has the following institutions: Scientific Research Section, Graduate Student Section, Publishing Section, and Compilation and Translation Office.

    The undergraduate departments and specialized courses of Renmin University of China are directly led by the president. Departments and classes are teaching and administrative organizations. The teaching and research offices are actually responsible for carrying out teaching work and scientific research work. Currently, each undergraduate department has three to five teaching and research offices. In addition, there are eight teaching and research offices for common courses, which are directly led by the academic affairs department. The school has established a total of thirty-five teaching and research offices, organized approximately two hundred and fifty graduate students, and recruited more than two hundred and ten teachers to engage in teaching work. The courses for the specialized courses are also undertaken by the teaching and research offices.

    The teaching and research office is also a characteristic of the organization of Renmin University of China. It is the basic teaching organization of the university. Studying Soviet experience and combining it with Chinese reality, each teaching and research office directly conducts teaching and research work for one or several closely related courses. The teaching and research office is composed of a director, deputy director, Soviet scientific advisor, lead lecturer, teaching assistant, and graduate students, who are responsible for lecturing, practice, tutoring, and scientific research, respectively. Before the start of classes, the teaching and research office formulates a teaching outline for the courses to be taught in the semester based on the education plan, which is submitted to the president for approval and implementation. The outline includes the basic purpose and content of the course, the workload and implementation plan, a list of important reference books and reference materials, and the methods and organization of teaching. In addition, the teaching and research office must also formulate a scientific research plan in coordination with the teaching work. Each teaching staff member and graduate student participating in the teaching and research office must also formulate a personal work plan and research plan and implement them conscientiously. The teaching and research office should establish contact with relevant business departments in teaching work and scientific research work, regularly investigate the actual work situation in various aspects, collect materials, and enrich teaching materials. Currently, the relevant departments of the Central People's Government have designated special personnel to contact the teaching and research offices of Renmin University of China to participate in guiding teaching work. The heads of various departments will also come to the school at certain times to give relevant lectures or reports. After studying the courses for a certain period of time, students of each department and class will go to the relevant business departments for general production practice and professional practice.

    The basic spirit of the teaching method of Renmin University of China is to emphasize the quality and effectiveness of teaching. Under the highly responsible system of teaching staff, a series of teaching links are organized in a guided, planned, and prepared manner so that the taught subjects can be thoroughly accepted by students and correctly applied. The main links in teaching are lecturing and practice. Lectures are given by the lead lecturer. Each lecture has a lecture outline written according to the education plan. The lecture should systematically and emphatically explain the problems and raise the key points of practice to the students. The practice courses have pre-announced practice questions. Students write their speaking outlines during self-study. The practice class is taught by the teaching assistant, who prepares standard answers for each practice question in advance. The method is: the teacher assigns students to speak according to each practice question, explains the questions, and if it is insufficient, other students speak to discuss or supplement the questions. Finally, the teacher or a designated student makes a summary speech so that students can understand the course more systematically and comprehensively. Before each lecture or practice, the teaching and research office must hold a preparation meeting to discuss and decide on the lecture outline and practice questions and answers, and review the previous lecture and practice class. In addition, students must preview before lectures and review after lectures during the learning process. Teachers also provide tutoring to students during the review of their lessons and answer the questions raised by the students.

    The textbooks for various professional courses at Renmin University of China are compiled with reference to the latest textbooks of Soviet higher education institutions, and the courses of each department are very rich. When combined with the actual situation in China, Soviet professors particularly focus on studying the policies and policies of various construction works in China and incorporating these contents into the lecture notes. In all teaching work at Renmin University of China, due to the acceptance of Soviet experience and the direct help of Soviet professors, planning and organization are shown everywhere. The hard work spirit of the school leaders and teaching staff, and the conscious and active learning enthusiasm of the worker-peasant students, have established a progressive learning style. Every student must conscientiously complete the study plan and strive to think independently, conduct in-depth research, and then accept the test or enrich it in collective research.

    Renmin University of China will recruit a large number of worker-peasant students every year in the future and will gradually expand and add various classes and departments according to the needs of national construction and development.

　　新国家的新大学
    ——中国人民大学介绍
    以马克思列宁主义为教学指导思想的中国人民大学，已经为新中国的人民高等教育事业指出了一个新的方向。
    一九四九年十月一日中华人民共和国成立，新国家的伟大建设工作从此开端。为适应国家建设需要，中央人民政府政务院于一九四九年十二月十六日第十一次政务会议通过决定设立中国人民大学，接受苏联先进的建设经验，并聘请苏联教授，有计划有步骤地培养新国家的各种建设干部。接着中央人民政府教育部于十二月十九日作出了关于中国人民大学实施计划的决定；并由陆定一、吴玉章、钱俊瑞、成仿吾等人组成中国人民大学筹备委员会，在中央人民政府各有关部门及苏联专家费辛科、菲立波夫大力帮助之下，进行了几个月的筹备工作，拟定了学校组织、课程草案和教学组织办法。一九五○年初，该校即开始在全国各地招收本科学生，三月一日本科各系即先行开课。到本年暑假中，该校所聘苏联教授大部到校，协助学校将本科各系和专修科各班全部教育计划拟定。专修科各班也在暑假中开始在全国招生。现该校本科各系已于九月一日上课，专修科各班也已于九月二十九日上课，全校并于十月三日举行了正式开学典礼。
    中国人民大学招收学生的对象，首先是参加工作有一定年限，具有相当文化水平的工农革命干部和有一定工龄和文化水平的进步工人，其次是进步的青年知识分子。该校现有学生三千余人（包括本科、专修科、文化补习班），其中有工农革命干部一千八百二十七人（工作历史八年以上的有五百七十人），进步工人一百七十二人；全部学生中有中国共产党党员一千七百三十三人，新民主主义青年团团员六百五十一人。学生一般地具有高度的阶级觉悟，把在中国人民大学学习当作学好本领去更好地为人民服务的革命任务，能够自觉地积极地遵守学习组织与学习计划，全心全意地努力学习；尤其进步工人最多的本科工厂管理系学生，他们在本年三月到七月的学习过程中，表现了高度的刻苦钻研的精神，不但克服了文化水平较低的困难，而且成为全校成绩最好的一系。现在该校本科计有经济计划、财政、贸易、合作、工厂管理、法律、外交、俄文等八个系，各系修业年限除法律、外交两系为四年外，其余均为三年。专修科现有合作社、统计、国内贸易、对外贸易、经济计划、财政、工厂管理、史地、教育、法律、外交等十一个班，各班修业期限为八个月。
    中国人民大学的教育方针是教学与实际联系、苏联经验与中国情况相结合。根据这一方针，该校的全体教育干部，必须环绕教学经常进行某些科学研究工作，以不断地提高科学水平、教学质量和教学效果。因此该校的组织特点之一，是在一般大学的教学行政领导机关教务部之外，另有研究部之设置。研究部负责全校科学研究工作的领导，其具体的工作是：组织各教研室的科学研究工作；检查各教研室每个人的科学研究工作计划；领导教员在思想水平和理论水平上的不断提高及研究生的培养；组织、领导、教材和参考资料的编译与出版等。研究部下设有：科学研究处、研究生产、出版处、编译室等机构。
    中国人民大学的本科各系和专修科都直接由校长领导。系、班为教学行政组织，实际负责进行教学工作和科学研究工作的是教研室。现在该校本科每一系都有三个到五个教研室，另外还有共同课的教研室八个，由教务部直接领导。该校已经设立的教研室共有三十五个，组织了约二百五十个研究生，并吸收了二百一十余个教员从事教学工作。专修科各班课程，也都由各教研室负担。
    教研室也是中国人民大学组织的特点，它是大学的基本教学组织，研究苏联经验并结合中国实际，每个教研室直接进行一门或有密切联系的数门课程的教学和研究工作。教研室由主任、副主任、苏联科学指导员、主讲教员、实习教员、研究生等共同组成，分别负担讲课、实习、辅导、科学研究等工作。教研室在开课之前，就根据教育计划拟定本学期应教课程的讲授提纲，交校长批准实行；提纲包括课程的基本目的和内容、课程份量与进行计划、重要参考书与参考资料目录、教学进行的方法与组织。另外教研室还要配合教学工作订出科学研究计划。参加教研室的每一教学工作干部和研究生也要订出个人的工作计划和研究计划，切实执行。教研室在教学工作和科学研究工作上，都要与有关的业务部门取得联系，经常调查各方面的实际工作情况，收集材料，充实教材；现在中央人民政府各有关部门，都已指定专人与中国人民大学各教研室联系，参加指导教学工作，各部门负责人并将在一定的时间到校作有关的讲授或报告。各系、班学生在进行了一定时间的课程学习之后，都要分别到各有关业务部门进行一般生产实习和专业实习。
    中国人民大学教学方法的基本精神是强调教学的质量和效果，在教学工作干部高度负责的制度下，有领导有计划有准备地组织一系列的教学环节，使所教科目能彻底为学生所接受并能正确地运用。教学中的主要环节为讲授和实习。讲授由主讲教员担任，每次都有根据教育计划写好的讲授提纲，在讲授中要有系统有重点地说明问题，并向学生提出实习要点。实习课程有预先公布的实习题，学生在自修时写好发言提纲；实习课由实习教员担任，并事先对每个实习题准备好标准答案；其进行方法是：由教员根据每一实习题指定学生发言，申引其中问题，不足时再由其他学生发言，对问题加以讨论或补充，最后由教员本人或指定学生作总结发言，使学生能够更有系统地和全面地深入了解所学课程。在每次讲课或实习之前，教研室都要分别举行准备会，讨论决定讲授提纲和实习题及答案，并检讨上次讲授及实习课的情况。此外在学生学习过程中还有讲课以前的预习和以后的复习，教员在学生复习功课时还要进行辅导，解答学生所提出的问题。
    中国人民大学的各种业务课教材都是参考苏联高等学校最新的教本而编定，而且各系课程都很丰富；在结合到中国实际时，苏联教授都特别着重研究中国的各种建设工作的方针政策，把这些内容都编进讲义里去。在中国人民大学的全部教学工作上，由于接受苏联经验和苏联教授的直接帮助，处处都表现了计划性和组织性。而学校领导干部和教学干部的艰苦奋斗精神，工农成份学生的自觉的积极的学习热情，建立了一种进步的学习作风。每一个学生都必须认真地完成学习计划，并力求独立思考、深入钻研，再在集体研究中接受考验或充实。
    中国人民大学以后每年将招收大批的工农成份的学生，并将根据国家建设发展的需要，逐步扩充、增设各种班、系。
