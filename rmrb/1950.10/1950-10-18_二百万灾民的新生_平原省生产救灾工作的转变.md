　　The Rebirth of Two Million Disaster Victims
    ——The Transformation of Production and Disaster Relief Work in Pingyuan Province
    Zhou Ziqin
  　I. Overview of the Great Famine
    Pingyuan Province suffered a major disaster last year. In mid-September last year, continuous heavy rain caused the Yellow River's water level to rise sharply, and the river dikes experienced breaches in over 200 locations across the entire line. More than 4,000 cadres and 150,000 people were mobilized to repair and block the breaches day and night, and 200 kilometers of secondary embankments were built, and the situation eased. However, due to the excessive water volume, more than 700 villages within the riverbed were completely flooded. At the same time, the breaches of the people’s dikes in Shou Zhang and Liangshan counties turned most areas of the two counties into watery expanses. In the eastern lake area (around Weishan and Dongping Lakes), counties such as Nan (wang), Jia (xiang), Jin (xiang), and Yu (tai) were located in low-lying areas where water from the Zhao Wang River, Zhu River, and other rivers converged from all directions, creating a vast expanse of water stretching 300 li from north to south and 70-80 li from east to west, with depths reaching 3-4 meters, affecting 2.2 million people.
    This disaster was inseparable from the war damage of the past ten years. For more than a decade, the pillaging, burning, and killing by Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits had caused severe damage to rural areas. Coupled with the general lack of rain after the start of spring last year, more than half of the areas suffered from frost and hail disasters around the time of the wheat harvest. Insect plagues also spread across 55 counties, affecting 6.4 million mu of land. Moreover, the areas along the Yellow River in Jiaxiang, Liangshan, and other counties had not yielded harvests for four consecutive years since the Yellow River returned to its old course, further exacerbating the disaster situation throughout the province.
    After the disaster occurred, the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government immediately rescued the disaster victims in the water, issued emergency disaster relief instructions, and allocated more than one million jin of grain for emergency relief. The Pingyuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also adopted a winter production and disaster relief plan at the First Provincial Party Congress in October last year, calling on the entire Party to lead the disaster victims to overcome the disaster.
    II. Overcoming Bureaucratic Work Style and Launching Production for Self-Salvation.
    Although the production and disaster relief plan had been formulated, the lack of specific organization led to serious spontaneous tendencies. Bureaucratic work styles were quite serious in leadership organizations at all levels. For example, among the 930,000 people in the disaster areas of Jin (xiang), Jia (xiang), and Yu (tai) counties in the Huxi Special District, the number of disaster victims had reached 840,000, and nearly 300,000 had fled the famine. However, leadership organs at all levels were still focusing on the concluding stages of land reform. Until early November, except for Shou Zhang County, no county had seriously led production and disaster relief work in even one village. As a result, the disaster situation developed rapidly. From October to the end of December, the number of disaster victims fleeing the entire disaster area increased from 360,000 to 500,000. The number of disaster victims also increased from 2.5 million to over 2.7 million. Some lightly affected areas became severely affected areas.
    Facts have proven that to ensure the successful implementation of production and disaster relief work, it is necessary to wage a serious struggle against bureaucracy. Timely and in-depth inspections from top to bottom are one of the important steps in implementing the production and disaster relief policy and correcting bureaucratic work styles.
    In late October, the Provincial Government organized disaster area work teams to conduct in-depth inspections of disaster areas. The work of the Heze and Huxi Special Districts were inspected first. It was found that not only had the principle of production and disaster relief work not been implemented in these two special districts, but they also lacked specific plans and preparations for disaster relief work. According to the analysis of the disaster situation at that time, although the disaster was very serious, it was possible to survive if the disaster victims could be organized for production and self-salvation, "transforming living materials into production capital," coupled with partial government assistance. It was immediately clarified that production and disaster relief should be the focus, and cadres should be organized to go deep into the disaster areas. Production and disaster relief committees and cooperatives were established, and loans and food were distributed through the cooperatives to support disaster victims in production. The special commissioner's office and the local party committee also conducted self-criticism and criticism of the bureaucratic work style, which initially halted the spontaneous state of production and disaster relief work.
    The situation in the Huxi Special District was even more serious. At that time, nearly 200,000 disaster victims had fled, and half of the livestock had been sold. However, by early November, the province's disaster relief work plan had not yet been implemented at the village level. The leadership first sent work teams to disaster areas such as Jiaxiang, Jinxiang, and Yutai counties to investigate the disaster situation, and then inspected the leadership and criticized the bureaucratic work style of the leadership. After the work team arrived in the disaster area, they held small forums with production models, activists, village cadres, party members, old farmers, and families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers to understand the disaster situation, study ways to survive the famine, and organize disaster victims to engage in production for self-salvation. Subsequently, a joint meeting of special and county cadres was held to criticize the bureaucratic work style in disaster relief work, and it was decided to proceed from the existing material and human resources, helping each disaster victim make a plan through specific accounting, and find ways for production. Facts have proven that as long as the cadres' minds are clear and they increase their confidence in production for self-salvation, they can lead the masses, overcome difficulties, and defeat the disaster.
    After these inspections and specific assistance, the disaster relief work in Huxi also began to change.
    However, this inspection only focused on the implementation of the policy in severely affected areas, and did not pay attention to the inspection of the implementation of the policy in general disaster areas. It was not until January this year when the Deputy Chairman of the Provincial Government and the Deputy Minister of the Central Ministry of Internal Affairs, Chen Qiyuan, inspected the disaster situation in Shou Zhang and Liangshan counties, that they discovered that the policy of disaster relief work had not yet been implemented in the disaster areas of Jin, Jia, and Nanwang counties. They immediately helped to reverse the situation, and disseminated the successful experience of Shou Zhang County in implementing production and disaster relief through people's representative meetings, emphasizing careful calculations; advocating "relying on the mountains if you live near the mountains, and relying on the water if you live near the water"; organizing disaster victims to transport goods, develop side occupations, repair dikes and control rivers, and using work as a form of relief; cadres and all parties helping disaster victims find ways for production, making plans for each household and each person, specifically solving the difficulties of disaster victims; the government also allocated more than 10 million jin of disaster relief grain to strongly support disaster victims in production. In addition to the disaster area work team of more than 160 people organized by the Provincial Government, each special district also organized an inspection team of more than 200 people to work in the disaster areas. Due to timely inspection, summarizing and disseminating experiences, praising achievements, and criticizing and exposing mistakes and deviations, by early February, a production and self-salvation movement had taken shape in Shou Zhang County, the ninth district of Liangshan, the ninth district of Jiaxiang, the first and sixth districts of Nanwang, the Gutin district of Yutai, and the Sunheng district of Jinxiang. By March, cooperatives had also become generally active, and the bureaucratic work style existing in disaster relief work had begun a comprehensive transformation.
    However, the bureaucratic work style has not been completely resolved, and it is still very serious in some areas. For example, the distribution of disaster relief grain did not rely on the masses and could not be distributed to the disaster victims in a timely manner, resulting in the serious phenomenon that while the vast number of disaster victims had no food to eat, a large amount of disaster relief grain and funds could not be distributed. The work was delayed and the procedures were complicated. The grain allocation procedures for distributing disaster relief grain in the Heze Special District took as long as 27 days. Some cadres became complacent after seeing some achievements in disaster relief work, believing that there was no problem with the disaster and relaxing the due emphasis on disaster relief work. Some village cadres, party members, or the masses (such as in the Huxi area) developed serious wasteful phenomena of blind optimism and excessive eating and drinking after the autumn harvest. It can be seen from this that opposing bureaucracy is a continuous, long-term, and arduous struggle. The idea that inspections and criticisms have been carried out on bureaucratic work styles, so everything is fine, will inevitably condone the development of bureaucracy.
    III. Two Approaches, Two Results.
    In production and disaster relief work, two approaches and two different results were clearly illustrated: One is the mass line approach: Starting from the existing strength of the masses, actively helping the masses to think of ways, find a way out, and organize the masses to produce for self-salvation. Wherever this method is adopted, disaster relief work will achieve results. In contrast, there is the bureaucratic approach, passively waiting for loans and relief from superiors, and making plans. Without starting from the existing conditions of the masses and without raising the masses' awareness of production for self-salvation, disaster relief is bound to fail.
    In sideline production: One is to rely on the masses, carry forward the spirit of "relying on the mountains if you live near the mountains, and relying on the water if you live near the water" on the basis of the masses' original production, think of various ways, and start from small places. Because Shou Zhang County adopted this method, 80% of the 140,000 disaster victims in the county found a way out in sideline production. In many other areas, wherever this method was adopted, disaster relief work also achieved results. The other method is to make empty plans, without starting from the existing conditions of the masses, simply relying on government loans and relief, and disaster relief work is bound to fail.
    In solving production capital, one is to start from the existing manpower, materials, and financial resources of the masses, calling on them to think of ways themselves: "turning dead money into living money, turning living materials into production capital," advocating mutual assistance, cooperation, and free lending, and providing appropriate assistance to those who really have no way to think of it. Then the masses can engage in production for self-salvation. The opposite method is to only rely on loans to organize the masses, organizing as many masses as there are loans, and disaster relief work is bound to fail.
    In production and disaster relief work, we should promote the former mass line approach and oppose the latter bureaucratic approach.
    IV. Continuing to Prevent Famine is Still an Important Task
    Pingyuan Province has achieved remarkable results in production and disaster relief work due to the implementation of the struggle against bureaucracy. The 2.7 million disaster victims in the entire region have victoriously overcome the disaster. According to various incomplete statistics: the government's loans of grain and funds and the economic departments' purchase of disaster victims' products amounted to more than 80 million jin of grain invested in the disaster area. In organizing disaster victims for production, most areas have reached 80% to 100% of full and semi-labor force participation. There are already 4,298 cooperatives with 1.05 million members. This year, the cooperatives purchased 50 million square feet of locally woven cloth from disaster victims. By this year before the wheat harvest, a total of 11.79 million jin of disaster relief grain and donated grain had been allocated. In most areas, half of the disaster victims who had fled have returned to their hometowns. This autumn, the disaster areas south of the Yellow River have generally reaped a bumper harvest, and the famine can be overcome. Only Liangshan still has some long-term waterlogged areas, with 170,000 disaster victims who have lost their ability to cultivate the land, and long-term disaster relief plans must be made for them. However, most of these disaster victims currently have surplus grain. In addition, some counties in the Heze and Puyang Special Districts suffered from drought in the summer, and most of the minor autumn crops were killed by drought. Some areas in the Anyang and Xinxiang Special Districts also suffered continuous hail disasters. The total number of disaster-affected people has increased to about one million. Although the severity of the disaster varies, how to lead and organize them to produce and survive the famine is also a very urgent issue.
    Judging from the situation in Pingyuan Province, to completely defeat the disaster, we must focus on the fundamental aspects. Due to the harm of the Yellow River and the war, Pingyuan Province has suffered from floods, droughts, and insect plagues every year in the past. The main reason is that the problem of disaster has not been fundamentally solved from the perspective of long-term construction. In the past, there were many difficulties due to the wartime environment, but in the future, we must focus on solving it from the root cause in order to finally and completely defeat the disaster: First, we must plan and step by step open rivers and dig channels in the low-lying areas where water accumulates year after year to dredge the accumulated water and correct the past phenomenon of not having drainage equipment beforehand and only making plans after the accumulated water becomes a disaster. Second, insect plagues are particularly numerous and widespread in Pingyuan Province. The fundamental way to eliminate insect plagues is to ensure that cultivation is timely, eliminate wasteland and weeds, and pay attention to deep plowing and careful cultivation. Conduct widespread insect prevention education for the masses and immediately extinguish them upon discovery. Third, afforestation also has special significance in Pingyuan Province. It should be effectively carried out, especially on both sides of the Yellow River and in desert areas.

　　二百万灾民的新生
    ——平原省生产救灾工作的转变
    周子芹
  　一、大灾荒的概况
    平原省去年遭受大灾荒。去年九月中旬，霪雨连绵，黄河水势大涨，河堤全线出险，发生漏洞二百多处；全省出勤干部四千余人，动员群众十五万，昼夜抢修，堵塞漏洞，并筑成子埝二百公里，情况始告和缓。但由于水势过大，河床内七百余村全被淹没。同时，因寿张、梁山两县民埝先后被水冲决，以致两县大部地区变成泽国。而在东部靠湖（微山、东平两湖）地区的南（旺）、嘉（祥）、金（乡）、鱼（台）等县，由于地势低洼，赵王河，洙水河等河之水四面汇集，由寿张至鱼台，南北三百里，东西七八十里，变成汪洋一片，水深达三、四公尺，受灾群众达二百二十万人。
    这次灾荒和过去十多年的战争破坏是分不开的。十余年来，由于日寇、蒋匪军的抢掠烧杀，使农村遭受严重破坏。加上去年入春后普遍缺雨，麦收前后半数以上地区遭受霜灾、雹灾；虫灾亦遍及五十五县，受灾面积六百四十万亩；而黄河沿岸嘉祥、梁山等县，自黄河归故之后，大部地区已连续四年未收，也加重了全省灾情。
    灾情发生之后，平原省人民政府即一面抢救水中灾民，一面发出紧急救灾指示，并拨粮一百余万斤进行急赈。中共平原省委也在去年十月全省第一次党代表会上，通过了冬季生产救灾、节约度荒计划，号召全党领导灾民战胜灾荒。
    二、克服官僚主义作风，展开生产自救。
    生产救灾计划虽已制订，由于缺乏具体组织，产生了严重的自流现象。官僚主义的作风，在各级领导机构中，相当严重。如湖西专区金（乡）、嘉（祥）、鱼（台）等县灾区的九十三万人口中，灾民已达八十四万，逃荒者已近三十万，但各级领导机关仍然以主要力量搞结束土地改革工作。直到十一月初，除寿张县以外，没有一个县认真地领导过一个村的生产救灾工作。因而灾情迅速发展，由十月至十二月底，整个灾区外逃灾民由三十六万增加到五十万人。灾民人数也由二百五十万增加到二百七十万以上。部分轻灾区变成了重灾区。
    事实证明：要保证生产救灾工作的胜利进行，必须和官僚主义进行严重的斗争。由上而下的及时的深入检查，则是贯彻生产救灾方针，纠正官僚主义作风的重要步骤之一。
    十月下旬，省府即组织了灾区工作队，深入灾区检查。首先检查了菏泽、湖西两专区的工作。发现这两个专区不仅生产救灾工作的方针没有贯彻，而且都缺乏救灾工作的具体计划和准备。根据当时灾区情况分析，灾荒虽很严重，如能组织灾民生产自救，“变生活资料为生产资本”，加上政府的部分扶助，度荒是有把握的。当即明确以生产救灾为中心，组织干部深入灾区工作。建立生产救灾委员会和合作社，通过合作社分配贷款贷粮，支持灾民生产。专署和地委也都进行了对官僚主义作风的检讨和批评，才初步停止了生产救灾工作的自流状态。
    湖西专区的情况更为严重。当时灾民逃荒已近二十万，牲口卖掉已达二分之一，但到十一月初，省的救灾工作计划还未贯彻到村。领导方面乃一面派工作组到嘉祥、金乡、鱼台等灾区调查灾情，一面检查领导，批评领导作风上的官僚主义。工作组到灾区后就召开生产模范、积极分子、村干部、党员、老农以及烈军工属等的小型座谈会，了解灾情，研究度荒办法，组织灾民进行生产自救。继即召开专、县干部联席会议，批评了救灾工作中官僚主义作风，决定从现有物力人力出发，经过具体算账，帮助每个灾民订计划，找出生产门路。事实证明：只要干部头脑清醒了，提高了生产自救的信心，就能带领群众，克服困难，战胜灾荒。
    经过这些检查和具体帮助之后，湖西的救灾工作也开始有了转变。
    但这次检查只注意了重灾区方针的贯彻，没有注意对一般灾区救灾工作贯彻方针情况的检查，直到今年一月份省府副主席和中央内务部陈其瑗副部长到寿张、梁山等县视察灾情时，才发现金、嘉、南旺等县灾区，救灾工作方针仍未贯彻，即帮助扭转情况，并传播了寿张县运用人民代表会议贯彻生产救灾的成功经验，强调精打细算；提倡“靠山吃山，靠水吃水”；组织灾民运输，发展副业，修堤治河，以工代赈；干部及各方面帮助灾民找生产门路，逐户逐人订计划，具体解决灾民困难；政府亦拨出救灾粮一千多万斤，大力支持灾民生产。除省府组织了一百六十余人的灾区工作团外，各专区也组织了二百多人的检查组，深入灾区工作。由于及时检查，总结、传播经验，表扬成绩，批评与揭发错误和偏向，到二月初，寿张全县，梁山九区，嘉祥九区，南旺一、六两区，鱼台谷亭区，金乡孙桁区等都已形成了生产自救运动。到三月份，合作社也普遍活跃起来，救灾工作中存在的官僚主义作风，已开始了全面的转变。
    但官僚主义作风并未彻底解决，在若干地区还是很严重的。如救灾粮的发放，由于不依靠群众，不能及时发到灾民手中，以致发生一方面广大灾民没饭吃，同时又有大量救灾粮款发不下去的严重现象。工作拖延迟缓，手续繁杂。菏泽专区发放救灾粮的拨粮手续就辗转达二十七天，有的干部在看到救灾工作已收到一些成绩后，就自满起来，认为灾荒已无问题，放松了对救灾工作的应有重视；而有的村干党员或群众（如湖西地区）在秋季丰收之后，又产生了盲目乐观，大吃大喝的严重浪费现象。由此可见，反对官僚主义是一个持续不断的、长期的、艰苦的斗争。认为对官僚主义作风已经进行了检查和批评，就认为百事大吉的想法，必然会纵容官僚主义的发展。
    三、两种作法，两种结果。
    在生产救灾工作中，清楚的说明了两种作法和两种不同的结果：一种是群众路线的作法：从群众现有的力量出发，积极帮助群众想办法，找出路，组织群众生产自救。凡采用这种办法的，救灾工作就获得成绩。与此相反的则是官僚主义的作法，消极等待上级贷款，救济，定出计划。不从群众现有条件出发，不提高群众生产自救的自觉性，这样救灾就必然遭受失败。
    在副业生产上：一种是依靠群众，在群众原有生产基础上，发扬“靠山吃山，靠水吃水”的精神，想各种办法，从小处搞起。寿张县由于采用了这样的办法，全县十四万灾民中，有百分之八十在副业生产上找到了出路。其他许多地区凡采用了这一办法的，救灾工作也就有成绩。另外一种则是定空计划，不从群众现有条件出发，单纯依靠政府贷款救济，救灾工作就一定遭受失败。
    在解决生产资本中，一种是从群众现有的人力、物力、财力上着手，号召自己想办法：“变死钱为活钱，变生活资料为生产资本”，提倡互助合作自由借贷，对确实无法可想者，政府予以适当扶助，群众生产自救就能搞起来。相反的办法，则是只凭贷款组织群众，有多少贷款组织多少群众，救灾工作就一定遭受失败。
    在生产救灾工作上，应发扬前一种群众路线的作法，反对后一种官僚主义的作法。
    四、继续防荒仍为重要任务
    平原省由于贯彻了反对官僚主义的斗争，生产救灾工作已获显著成绩，全区二百七十万灾民已胜利战胜了灾荒。据各种不完全统计：仅政府贷粮贷款及各经济部门收购灾民产品，共投入灾区粮食即达八千余万斤。在组织灾民生产上，大部地区已达全劳力、半劳力百分之八十到百分之百。合作社已有四千二百九十八个，社员一百零五万人，今年经合作社收购灾民纺织的土布达五千万平方尺。到今年麦收前为止，共拨出救灾粮及捐款粮一千一百七十九万斤。外逃灾民大部地区已有一半回乡。今年秋季黄河以南各灾区普遍丰收，灾荒已可度过。只有梁山还有部分长年积水地区，其中有丧失耕作条件的灾民十七万人，必须作长期救灾打算。但这种灾民目前也大都存有余粮。此外今年在菏泽、濮阳两专区的部分县份中，因夏季缺雨，小秋多被旱死，而安阳、新乡等专区的部分地区又连续遭受雹灾，总计受灾人口又增加到百万左右，虽灾情轻重不同，但如何领导与组织他们生产度荒，也是一个十分迫切的问题。
    根据平原省地区情况来看，要彻底战胜灾荒，必须从根本上着眼。由于黄河与战争的遗害，平原省过去每年发生水、旱、虫灾。主要原因未能从长期建设观点上来根本解决灾荒问题。过去由于战争环境困难很多，但今后却必须从根本上着眼解决，才能最后彻底战胜灾荒：一、有计划有步骤的在连年积水的低洼地区开河挖渠，疏导积水，纠正过去事前无疏水设备，直到积水成灾后再作打算的现象。二、平原省虫灾特别多而普遍，消灭虫灾的根本办法，必须使耕作及时，消灭荒地和野草，注意深耕细作。对群众广泛进行防虫教育，一经发现立即扑灭。三、植树造林在平原省亦有特别重要意义。特别在黄河两岸及荒沙地带，应有效的开展起来。
