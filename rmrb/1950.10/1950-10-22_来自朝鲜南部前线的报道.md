Reports from the Southern Korean Front
    By Li Changde, Frontline Correspondent for the Korean Central News Agency

    (1) MacArthur-style "Operations"
    The ×× detachment and a tank detachment of the Luo Dong River front made a transfer due to the needs of the war and retreated to a pre-prepared position. The reporter was with the soldiers.

    On September ××, the American mechanized armored forces, leading the South Korean puppet army, launched the most bizarre and aimless battle against Hill 303.2 near Waegwan.

    We had already understood the enemy's situation. Only a small force and reconnaissance team members were left in this area, and they were sheltering in a safe area away from the position, watching the enemy's situation.

    Thus, the so-called MacArthur-style operation began on this unmanned high ground.

    First, fifty medium bombers concentrated on dropping many large bombs on the high ground. Then, swarms of fighter planes strafed the high ground with rocket launchers and machine guns. Then countless large-caliber shells were fired arbitrarily. At this time, attacking forces with tanks in the lead and infantry behind appeared in the distance.

    The American invading army and their servant army, based on their past painful experiences, cautiously crawled in with fearful hearts.

    In this way, they spent several hours climbing Hill 303.2. Naturally, this was originally an empty, unmanned position! They gained nothing. A large batch of American war surplus weapons was consumed by MacArthur in this way.

    (2) The People Are Fighting and Waiting

    The troops moved towards the predetermined location. The soldiers' hearts were boiling with fiery revenge. Even temporarily letting the American aggressors occupy the beloved land of the motherland was infuriating.

    When withdrawing from this area, which had been liberated with the soldiers' blood, the scene of the soldiers parting with the local people was heartbreaking.

    The night before yesterday, the transfer order was issued. The soldiers of each detachment, following orders, completed preparations for the retreat. They glared at the enemy's position with hateful eyes. Everyone raised their fists towards the enemy camp and swore: "We will return, and we will have a day of general counter-offensive!"

    The front line was bathed in the quiet moonlight. Nearby villagers, carrying their belongings and leading their women, children, and the elderly, came and asked to retreat with the People's Army. Comrades of the Village Democratic Youth League and the youth asked the People's Army to give them guns. They said that if the enemy came, they would go to the mountains to fight guerrilla warfare.

    In this small village in Chilgok County, North Gyeongsang Province, a few days ago, American beasts' planes first sprinkled gasoline and then dropped incendiary bombs, burning the entire village to ashes. Villager Jin Ganrong and his neighbors were burned alive because they could not escape in time. Their families and relatives buried the dead and firmly stated: Even if we have to use shovels and sickles, we will avenge our dead relatives! They held the hands of the People's Army soldiers tightly and said: "If the American invading army and the traitor Li Chengwan's army come back again, they will definitely kill, set fires, and seize the land that has been distributed. In order to defend our revolutionary achievements, we will fight them! We will fight until you come back."

    The people who were originally prepared to transfer with the People's Army decided not to leave and stay to continue the struggle.

    The People's Army and the brave people parted with tears. They were saddened but not grieved, because their hearts were firm. They all believed that the day of return, the day of meeting, would not be too long.

　　来自朝鲜南部前线的报道
    朝鲜中央通讯社前线特派员  李昌德
    （一）麦克阿瑟式的“作战”
    洛东江前线的××区分队和一个坦克区分队，因为战争的需要，作了转移，退到事先准备好的阵地。记者一直和战士们在一起。
    九月××号，美国的机械化装甲部队，率领着南朝鲜傀儡军队，向倭馆附近的三○三·二高地作了一次最离奇的无对象的战斗。
    事先我们已了解了敌情。在这一地区仅留下小部队和侦察组员，他们在远离阵地的安全地带掩蔽着，了望敌情。
    于是所谓麦克阿瑟式的作战就在这无人的高地上开始了。
    首先是五十架中型轰炸机集中地在高地上投了许多大型炸弹。接着又是成群的战斗机用火箭炮和机关枪向高地扫射。然后又任意地打过来无数的大口径炮弹。这时，在远方出现了坦克在前部队在后的攻击部队。
    美国的侵略军队和他们的仆从军，根据他们以往的吃过亏的经验，怀着害怕的心情，小心翼翼的爬进着。
    这样，他们花费了数小时，才爬上了三○三·二高地。自然，这原来是一座无人的空阵地！他们是一无所获的。美国的战争剩余武器就是这样地为麦克阿瑟消耗了一大批。
    （二）人民在斗争着等待着
    部队向着预定的地点转移。战士们心里沸腾着火样的复仇的热情。祖国的亲爱的土地即是暂时让美国侵略者占据，也是令人切齿痛恨的。
    在以战士们的鲜血解放的这个地区撤退时，全体战士和当地人民分别时的情景，是令人落泪的。
    前天的夜晚，转移的命令下达了。每个区分队的战士，听从指挥作完撤退准备。他们用憎恨的眼睛注视着仇敌的阵地。每人都向着敌阵举起拳头宣誓：“我们还要重来，我们将有总反攻的一天！”
    前线，正普照着静寂的月光。附近的村民抱着随身用的东西，携带着妇孺老弱来了，要求和人民军一起撤退。村里的民主青年同盟的同志们和青年们，要求人民军发枪给他们。他们说如果敌人来了，就上山打游击去。
    庆尚北道漆谷县的这个小村庄，不几天前，美国野兽的飞机在这里先洒上汽油，又投下烧夷弹，把整个村子烧成了灰。村民金甘熔和他的邻居们因逃不及竟被活活地烧死。他们的家属和亲人，埋葬了死者，坚决的表示：拿着铁锹和镰刀也要为死去的亲人报仇！他们紧紧地握住人民军战士的手说：“美国侵略军和卖国贼李承晚军如果再回来，一定要杀人放火，夺回已分得的土地。我们为了保卫自己的革命果实，我们要和他们战斗！我们要一直战斗到你们回来的时候。”
    原来预备跟人民军一起转移的人们决定不走，留下来继续斗争。
    人民军和勇敢的人民流着眼泪握别了。他们虽沉痛但并不悲哀。因为他们的心是坚定的。他们均相信那回来的日子、晤面的日子是不会太久的。
