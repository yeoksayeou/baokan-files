Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th (TASS): The Izvestia editorial, entitled "Setting an Inspiring Example for the People of the World," discusses the massive peaceful construction work being carried out throughout the Soviet Union. The paper writes: The entire Soviet people welcomes and responds to the historical decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers regarding the development of large-scale construction projects on the Volga River, in Turkmenistan, on the Dnieper River, and in Crimea with new labor achievements. The people's hopes and their most daring dreams are reflected in the grand plans to create power giants and build large irrigation systems in vast arid regions.

Only a people who resolutely and consistently implements a policy of peace, only a country where concern for the happiness of the people has become the primary, most sacred, and greatest motto, can set such goals before them.

The paper further states: While the peace-loving Soviet people are building canals, planting forests, and constructing power stations, the Anglo-American warmongers are brewing plans for looting the new world, establishing military bases, and carrying out a war of aggression against the Korean people.

The arms race in capitalist countries places an increasingly heavy burden on the shoulders of the working people, affecting their living standards. More than 70 percent of the US budget is used for armaments, while only 0.8 percent is allocated for national education. In Britain, military spending exceeds the total expenditure on health services, housing construction, and education.

In the Marshall Plan countries, the living conditions of the impoverished people, which were already bad enough, are deteriorating day by day. As a result of the arms race, the children of these countries are deprived of the opportunity to study. In Italy, 70 percent of children suffer from rickets due to constant malnutrition.

The conditions of the working people in the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, compared with those of the working people in capitalist countries, differ as much as day and night.

The Soviet state is striding forward in the grand new project of building communism, obtaining abundant material, cultural, and spiritual wealth for millions of people. The paper emphasizes: This is where the power, solemnity, and sublime humanity of communism lie.

In the world, there is no force that can stop the unstoppable movement of the Soviet people towards communism. They are under the leadership of the genius creator of human happiness, the beloved leader of the people, the great Stalin.

### “为世界人民立下令人鼓舞的榜样”——消息报论苏联人民在建设水利工程中所表现的力量

　　“为世界人民立下令人鼓舞的榜样” 
     ——消息报论苏联人民在建设水利工程中所表现的力量
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十八日电：消息报社论以《为世界人民立下令人鼓舞的榜样》为题，论述在苏联全国进行的庞大的和平建设工作。该报写道：苏联全体人民用新的劳动成绩去欢迎和答复苏联部长会议关于在伏尔加河、土库曼、第聂伯河、克里米亚等处发展庞大建筑工程的历史性的决定。人民的希望和他们最勇敢的梦想都反映在创造动力巨人和在广大干旱地区建筑大灌溉系统的规模宏大的计划上。
    只有坚决而一贯地实现和平政策的人民，只有对人民幸福的关切成为首要的、最神圣的和最伟大的格言的一个国家，才可以在他们面前安放这种目标。
    该报进一步称：当爱好和平的苏联人民正在建造运河，种植森林，建筑电力站的时候，英美战争贩子们正在酝酿屠杀新世界的掠夺计划，建立军事根据地，对朝鲜人民进行侵略战争。
    资本主义国家的军备竞赛，在劳动人民的肩头上放下了日益沉重的负担，影响到他们的生活标准。美国预算中有百分之七十以上用在军备上面，指定作为全国教育经费的只占百分之○·八。在英国，军费超过了健康服务，房屋建筑，和教育等的全部经费。
    在马歇尔化各国，生活条件已经够坏的贫苦阶层的人民，已步入一天坏过一天的境地。由于军备竞赛的结果，这些国家的儿童们被剥夺了求学的机会。在意大利，由于经常营养不良的缘故，百分之七十的儿童患有佝偻病。
    苏联和各人民民主主义国家劳动人民的状况，和各资本主义国家劳动人民的状况比较起来，其不同正如白日和黑夜之分。
    苏维埃国家在建设共产主义的规模宏大的新工程时迈步向前，替千百万人民大众获取丰富的物质文化和精神文化。该报强调称：共产主义的力量，庄严，和崇高的人道就在于此。
    在世界上，没有一种力量能够制止苏联人民向共产主义迈进这一不可遏止的运动。他们是在人类幸福的天才创造者，人民爱戴的领袖，伟大的斯大林领导之下的。
