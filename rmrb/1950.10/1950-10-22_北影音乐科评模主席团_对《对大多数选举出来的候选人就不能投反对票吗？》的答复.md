To the Editor:

　　The article "Can't We Vote Against Most of the Elected Candidates?" published in the "People's Garden" on September 10 criticized the compulsory election behavior of Xu, the head of the Music Department of our factory. Now we will tell you the course of this matter.

　　Our factory held a model selection campaign in mid-June by department. The Music Department held a model selection meeting on June 16. Before the meeting, five people were elected by the masses to form a presidium to be in charge of the model selection work.

　　The election steps were as follows: first, the groups deliberated, put forward a list of candidates and the candidates' exemplary deeds and shortcomings, and then submitted them to the department's general meeting for discussion.

　　At the model selection meeting, as a result of the vote, four of the nominated nineteen people were elected as model candidates for the department.

　　On the 17th, the official models of the department were elected. As a result of the vote (due to time constraints, only a show of hands was conducted), four people were elected with a majority of votes.

　　When we began to assess the grades (divided into four grades), someone wrote a note to the presidium asking: "Can I abstain from voting when assessing the grades if I don't agree with someone being a model?" The presidium submitted this question to the masses for discussion. Someone immediately asked the person who raised the question to state the reasons for abstaining for everyone's reference, but he did not provide specific reasons, only feeling that someone did not meet the conditions of a model. Xu, the head of the Music Department, considered that abstaining from the model evaluation would have a negative impact on the model, so he said to everyone: "Since the model has been recognized by the majority of people, don't abstain from voting when assessing the grades." Some comrades agreed with this opinion, while others opposed it. Later, Xu explained: "Everyone is not new here, and should understand the advantages and disadvantages of the four models. Moreover, many comrades have given detailed introductions to each person's exemplary deeds. Under these circumstances, abstaining from voting is not good, but it is okay if you really want to abstain." The presidium then conducted a vote based on the opinions of the masses. The result was that the majority disagreed that individuals could abstain.

　　When Xu spoke, he was indeed a little excited, and at the same time did not fully explain that anyone could abstain in the grading (although he later explained, it still made some comrades misunderstand that he was suppressing democracy). When dealing with this issue, the presidium did not realize that grading is like an election, and the masses also have the right to abstain, and actually put this issue to a vote. This is a shortcoming in our work.

### 北影音乐科评模主席团  对《对大多数选举出来的候选人就不能投反对票吗？》的答复

　　北影音乐科评模主席团
    对《对大多数选举出来的候选人就不能投反对票吗？》的答复编辑同志：
    九月十日《人民园地》发表《对大多数选举出来的候选人就不能投反对票吗？》一文，批评我厂音乐科徐科长强制选举的行为。现把此事的经过情形告诉你们。
    我厂曾在六月中旬以科为单位举行了一次选模运动。音乐科则在六月十六日举行选模大会。会前，由群众推选主席团五人，担任选模工作。
    选举的步骤，首先由小组酝酿，提出候选人名单及候选人的模范事迹与优缺点，然后交全科大会讨论。
    在选模会上，经票选的结果，提名的十九人中有四人当选为科的模范候选人。
    十七日选举科的正式模范。投票表决结果（因为时间关系仅进行举手表决），四人以多数票当选。
    当我们开始评定等级时（共分四级），有人写了一个条子给主席团，问：“在评等级时倘我不同意某人当模范，可弃权吗？”主席团就把这个问题交给群众讨论。当即有人要求提意见的人把弃权的理由讲出来，供大家参考，但他没有提出具体意见，只感觉某人不够模范的条件。音乐科徐科长考虑到评模弃权对模范影响不好，他即向大家说：“模范既已被大多数人公认了，在评等级时不要弃权。”有些同志同意这个意见，有些同志则反对这个意见。后来徐科长就解释道：“大家不是刚来的，对四位模范的优缺点是应该了解的，况且许多同志已将各人的模范事迹作了详细的介绍，在这种情况下弃权是不好的，但实在要弃权也可以。”主席团遂根据群众的意见进行了表决。结果不同意个人可以弃权的占大多数。
    徐科长发言时，确实有些激动，同时没有充分说明任何人在评级中可以弃权（虽然后来他作了解释，但仍使一部分同志误会他是压制民主）。主席团在处理这一问题时，没有认识到评级一如选举，群众亦有弃权的权利，竟把这个问题提付表决。这是我们工作中的缺点。
