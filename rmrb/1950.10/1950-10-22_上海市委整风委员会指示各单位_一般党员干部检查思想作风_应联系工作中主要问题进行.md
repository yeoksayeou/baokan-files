The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Rectification Committee Instructs All Units:
    General Party Member Cadres Should Examine Ideological Style in Connection with Major Issues in Their Work

    [Reported by this newspaper] Shanghai Jiefang Daily news: The rectification of cadres above the section and division chief level in Shanghai's various units is nearing completion. The Municipal Party Committee Rectification Committee has put forward the following suggestions to all units:

    I. The Rectification of General Party Member Cadres: After the rectification of cadres above the section and division chief level in various units is completed, rectification should be advanced to general Party member cadres. The rectification of general Party member cadres should also focus on key points. In general, they should connect with the main problems in work and style pointed out in the bureau and division rectification meetings, and focus on examining the commandist tendencies of being detached from the masses that have occurred in practical work, the mentality of being a meritorious official with arrogance and complacency, and the relationship between the Party and the masses. Lifestyle and ideological issues that do not seriously affect policies, work, and the relationship between the Party and the masses should be placed in the Party's regular work for education and handling. The methods for rectifying general Party member cadres can be to hold rectification meetings at the section level (or divisions with very few people) or to adopt Party group meetings. Each Party member cadre should conduct a review based on self-criticism, and everyone should discuss it. If opinions are divided and consensus cannot be reached, there is no need to argue endlessly or force consistency. It can be submitted to a higher level for resolution or left for gradual resolution later. Each person's review and everyone's speeches should be organized by themselves as a reference for their future efforts. No conclusions should be made about individuals, nor should they be passed by the group. General production branches and school branches of various district committees can focus on improving branch work based on the spirit of the rectification reports of the Municipal Party Committee, district committees, and relevant departments, and conduct necessary discussions and reviews in the branch committee. There is no need for general Party members to check one by one. The main thing is to strengthen the regular education of Party spirit and mass viewpoint based on the spirit of this rectification.

    II. The Combination of Party Rectification and Non-Party Members: The main spirit of combining Party rectification with non-Party members lies in: listening to the opinions of non-Party cadres on leadership in the rectification movement, and jointly studying ways to improve work and improve style, to achieve the purpose of enhancing internal and external unity and improving work efficiency. Rectification is not carried out among non-Party cadres, nor are they required to conduct self-examination. However, if non-Party cadres make self-criticisms entirely out of their own awareness, they should be welcomed, but it should not be subjectively required that all non-Party cadres do so. In agencies with very few non-Party cadres, they may be appropriately absorbed to participate in rectification meetings to listen to their opinions. In departments with more non-Party cadres, after the Party's internal examination is over, leading comrades should make a self-criticism work review report to non-Party cadres on the guiding principles, policies, style, especially issues related to the relationship between the Party and the masses, related to the work, and organize them to have discussions to collect opinions to supplement the Party's internal rectification report. Better adjust the relationship between each other.

    III. Improving Future Work: The main purpose of rectification is to improve our work and style. The rectification of various units should never be satisfied with past inspections. From top to bottom, we should pay close attention to the specific improvement of future work and style. After the rectification meetings at the bureau and division levels of major units are over, leading comrades should formulate specific steps and methods for improving the work and style of the unit based on the opinions raised by everyone, and after the rectification of general Party member cadres is over, put them forward for everyone to study and implement them in future practical work.

    IV. The Study of the Municipal Party Committee Rectification Report: After the Municipal Party Committee Rectification Report is published, every comrade should seriously read and understand it, and use this spirit to guide our review of past work and style, and our plans for future improvement of work and style. Do not separate from the actual rectification and set aside special time for study.

　　上海市委整风委员会指示各单位
    一般党员干部检查思想作风  应联系工作中主要问题进行
    【本报讯】上海解放日报消息：上海市各单位科、处长以上干部整风将大体结束。市委整风委员会向各单位提出下列意见：
    一、一般党员干部的整风问题：各单位科、处长以上干部整风结束后，应将整风推进到一般党员干部，一般党员干部的整风也应掌握重点，一般的应根据局、处整风会议所指出的在工作和作风上的主要问题联系自己，着重检查在实际工作中发生的脱离群众的命令主义倾向，功臣自居骄傲自满及党群关系。凡不严重影响政策、工作和党群关系的生活问题思想问题，应放到党的经常工作中去进行教育和处理。一般党员干部整风的方法，可以采取以科（或人数很少的处）为单位开整风会或采取党的小组会议，每个党员干部在自我批评的基础上进行检讨，大家讨论。如意见有分歧，不能争取一致时，不必无止境的争下去或强求一致，可提交上级解决或留待以后逐渐解决。各人的检讨及大家发言自行整理作为本人今后努力的参考，不对个人作结论，也不必交小组通过。各区委一般生产支部及学校支部，可根据市委区委及有关部门的整风报告精神，着重联系改进支部工作，在支委会中进行必要的讨论和检讨。一般党员不必逐个检查。主要是根据这次整风的精神，加强经常的党性和群众观念的教育。
    二、党内整风与党外相结合问题：党内整风与党外相结合的主要精神在于：在整风运动中，听取党外干部对领导上的意见，以及共同研究改进工作改善作风的办法，以达到增强内外团结提高工作效能的目的。不在非党干部中进行整风，也不要求作自我检讨。但如有党外干部完全出于自觉自愿的联系自我批评，应该表示欢迎，但不应主观地要求非党干部都要这样做。在非党干部很少的机关，可适当的吸收他们参加整风会倾听他们的意见。非党干部较多的部门，应在党内检查结束之后，有准备有重点地将与工作有关的方针政策，作风，特别是有关党群关系的问题，由领导同志向党外干部专作自我批评的工作检讨报告，组织他们座谈，征集意见，以补充党内的整风报告。更好调整相互关系。
    三、改进今后工作问题：整风的主要目的是在于改进我们的工作与作风，各单位的整风决不应满足于过去的检查，应该从上而下很好的注意对今后工作和作风的具体改进。各大单位局、处一级的整风会议结束后，领导同志应根据大家所提意见，订出本单位改进工作和作风的具体步骤，方法，待一般党员干部整风结束后，提出来和大家研究，在今后实际工作中加以贯彻。
    四、对市委整风报告的学习问题：市委整风报告发表后，每个同志均应认真阅读体会，以此精神来指导我们对过去工作和作风的检查，和对今后改进工作和作风的打算。不另离开实际整风划出专门时间进行学习。
