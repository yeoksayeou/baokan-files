Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 21st: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a war report on the 20th, stating that the People's Army units are conducting tenacious defensive battles on all fronts against the invading US military and the Syngman Rhee puppet army.

In the Pyongyang area, the enemy committed more troops to the battle, and under the cover of aircraft and tanks, launched fierce attacks, attempting to break through the defensive lines of the People's Army units. The People's Army units are conducting fierce defensive battles, holding their occupied areas, and inflicting significant losses on the US military in terms of manpower and equipment.

On the east coast, the People's Army units successfully repelled continuous enemy attacks in the Hamhung area.

According to the Pyongyang "Labor News" on September 22, forty-eight former South Korean "National Assembly" members sent a telegram to the United Nations Security Council and the Secretary-General of the United Nations on September 20 of this year, demanding that the United Nations General Assembly stop the American armed invasion of Korea. The telegram began by stating: "Due to the atrocities of the American armed invaders, our motherland is stained with blood and is suffering from bombing. We, the members of the National Assembly elected in South Korea on May 30, 1950, recognizing our civic obligations, submit this statement to the United Nations General Assembly."

The telegram continued: "The Korean people, with fearless heroism, are fighting against the American armed invaders and their henchmen, the Syngman Rhee gang, to demonstrate their firm will to uphold the democratic reforms of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and to safeguard the honor and independence of their motherland. Because of our ambition to seize political power, we once helped the American armed invaders to slaughter freedom-loving Korean people and bomb our cities and villages, as well as factories and manufacturing plants. Now we strongly condemn the Syngman Rhee gang, which has stained our motherland with blood. The Syngman Rhee gang, disregarding the suffering of the Korean people, is attempting to turn the Korean people into slaves once again. The Syngman Rhee gang has been rejected and condemned by our entire nation. Therefore, without American armed intervention, the Syngman Rhee gang would have been driven out of our motherland long ago, the war would have ended, the people would have been victorious, and a glorious and happy peaceful life would have been realized in our motherland."

The former South Korean "National Assembly" members, with unparalleled anger, accused the United Nations General Assembly: "The American armed invaders, in pursuit of imperialist aims, are carrying out barbarous bombing against the Korean people, turning peaceful Korean cities and villages into ashes, and bombing peaceful residents, regardless of the elderly, women, and children. The American armed invaders, in this war, have ignored the provisions of modern international law and human morality, and have used cruel means; as South Korean National Assembly members, we sympathize with the anger and passion of our people."

The telegram finally demanded: "We strongly demand that the United Nations General Assembly take measures to stop the American armed invasion and immediately withdraw all foreign troops." The telegram was signed by Zhao Suang, Zhang Liansong, An Zaihong, Zhao Xianyong, Jin Junxi, Piao Xingyu, Yu Jishu, Yuan Shixun, Xu Xianghao, Wu Haiyong, Jin Yongmao, Jin Zhengshi, and forty-eight others.

　　美军投入更多兵力猛犯平壤　朝鲜人民军进行激烈防御战
    前南朝鲜“国会”议员多人致电联大要求制止美国侵略
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社平壤讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部二十日发表战报称：人民军部队在各战线与进犯的美军及李承晚伪军进行顽强的防御战。
    在平壤方面，敌军投入更多的兵力作战，并在飞机与坦克的掩护下实行猛犯，企图突破人民军部队的防线，人民军部队进行激烈的防御战，坚守他们占领的地区，并使美军在有生力量及装备上遭受重大损失。
    在东海岸，人民军部队于咸兴地区胜利地击退了敌军不断的进攻。
    【本报讯】据九月二十二日平壤《劳动新闻》载称：前南朝鲜“国会”议员四十八名，于今年九月二十日致电联合国安全理事会及联合国秘书长，要求联合国大会制止美国武装侵犯朝鲜，电报首称：“由于美国武装侵犯者的暴行，我们祖国遍染鲜血，惨遭轰炸。一九五○年五月三十日在南朝鲜被选的我们国会议员自己认清了公民的义务，向联合国大会提出声明。”
    电报继称：“朝鲜人民以不怕牺牲的英勇的进行反对美国武装侵略者和其走狗李承晚匪帮的斗争，来表明坚守朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的民主改革及维护祖国荣誉和独立的坚强意志。我们由于有了争夺政权的野心，曾经帮助了美国武装侵略者屠杀爱好自由的朝鲜人民，并炸毁我们的城市和乡村，以及工厂和制造所，现在我们强硬的斥责使我们祖国疆土遍染鲜血的李承晚匪帮。李承晚匪帮不顾朝鲜人民的苦难，企图把朝鲜人民再一次变成亡国奴。李承晚匪帮受到了我们全民族的排斥与斥责，因此如果没有美国的武装干涉，李承晚匪帮就早已被驱逐出我们祖国，战争已经结束，人民已经胜利，在我们祖国疆土上已经实现了辉煌美满的和平生活。”
    前南朝鲜“国会”议员们以无比的愤怒，向联合国大会控诉：“美国武装侵略者，为追求帝国主义目的，对朝鲜人民进行野蛮的轰炸，使朝鲜的和平城市和乡村都变成灰烬，炸死了和平居民，不论老人、妇女和儿童。美国武装侵略者，在这一战争中，忽视了现代国际法的规定和人类的道德，使用残酷的手段；作为南朝鲜国会议员的我们同情自己人民的愤怒和激情。”
    电报最后要求：“我们强硬的向联合国大会要求采取措施停止美国武装侵犯，并即撤退全部外国军队。”在这一电报上签名的计有赵素昂、张连松、安在鸿、赵宪泳、金俊熙、朴性宇、俞基洙、元世勋、徐相镐、吴夏泳、金用茂、金正实等四十八人。
