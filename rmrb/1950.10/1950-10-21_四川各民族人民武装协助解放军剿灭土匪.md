Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 14th: In assisting the People's Liberation Army in suppressing bandits, people of various nationalities in the Sichuan area have gradually established armed organizations such as joint defense teams, self-defense forces, and militia teams. By the end of September, farmers' self-defense forces in various counties in western Sichuan had more than 134,000 members. After the establishment of these people's armed forces, they launched activities such as village joint defense, sentry duty, and reconnaissance patrols to actively cooperate with the People's Liberation Army in bandit suppression operations. Luo Wencai, a Miao farmer in Xuyong County, southern Sichuan, led a bandit suppression self-defense force that fought 64 battles in half a year, eliminating more than 340 remnant bandits. Tibetan knights in Maoniugou, Songpan County, northwestern Sichuan, and Tibetan people's armed forces led by Suo Guanying, the chieftain of Zhuokeji in Li County, have repeatedly annihilated bandits who roamed the area. Many villages and districts in eastern Sichuan have established bandit suppression intelligence groups, reconnaissance teams, and persuasion groups for bandits to repent. By the end of September, women in eastern Sichuan had persuaded more than 700 bandits to repent and turn themselves in. Women in Youyang, Xiushan, and other places also directly participated in bandit suppression operations. Zhang Deqing, a woman from Youyang County, once led more than 30 women and farmers to repel bandits who attempted to descend the mountain to disturb the people with hand grenades. Luo Qingyun and Li Xiaozhong, members of the Children's Corps in Yibin County, southern Sichuan, once led the local joint defense team to the forest and captured more than 50 bandits alive. At present, people of various nationalities in the Sichuan area are further expanding their armed forces under the leadership of the People's Government. More than 20,000 members of the farmers' self-defense forces in the seven counties surrounding Chengdu, western Sichuan, held a parade on National Day. They made solemn oaths before the portrait of Chairman Mao, expressing their determination to fight for the protection of the people and the interests of the country under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government.
