[Beijing News Agency] Labor-management consultation meetings in over ten private factories in Beijing are further promoting production. Since July, under the leadership of the trade union, workers in these factories have been consulting with the capitalists through labor-management consultation meetings. Based on the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital, both parties have set guarantee conditions and launched production competitions, achieving significant results.

After the competition began, workers' enthusiasm for labor soared. They consciously strengthened labor discipline, used their brains, and improved operating methods. As a result, labor productivity and product quality have significantly improved. At the same time, raw materials have been saved and costs reduced. Taking the Huadong Textile and Dyeing Factory as an example, the average monthly output of "August 1st" cloth woven by workers from May to July was 40 bolts per person. After the competition was launched, it increased to 57.2 bolts. In August and September, the factory's output continuously exceeded the plan. For example, in August, the original plan was to weave 550 bolts, but the result exceeded 15.4 percent. In terms of quality, the factory's rate of substandard cloth was previously 13.6 percent per month, but it decreased to 10.4 percent in August, and in September it decreased to only 1.62 percent. Workers who wind spindles and spools worked hard to save materials and carefully picked out useful materials from waste, resulting in a 20 percent reduction in waste in August compared to July, significantly reducing costs. For example, the production cost of each bolt of medicated cloth (excluding raw material costs) was reduced from 15 jin of millet to 13.4 jin. The product quality of the Zhongsheng and Jingwei Textile and Dyeing Factories improved the most, with the rate of substandard cloth in September reduced to 1 percent. The printing factory of the Fifties Publishing House overfulfilled the production plan in all departments for the three months of July, August, and September, and the quality improved, with the printed characters being clearer than before. In the past three months, it has also saved a lot of raw materials such as ink, kerosene, and paper.

The more important gain of the production competition is that each factory, through labor-management consultation, has established some basic systems from exploration, promoting the improvement of business management and reversing the lax production management of these factories in the past. The Huadong Textile and Dyeing Factory has established a finished product inspection, waste product exhibition, and machine use and maintenance system to ensure product quality and reduce machine failures. In addition, the factory also has a production progress chart, which plays a significant role in encouraging workers to complete production tasks on schedule. The printing factory of the Fifties Publishing House implemented a work recording system in each workshop, where workers fill out production report forms every day, and the factory director checks the production progress once a week and publishes it, solving problems at any time.

Due to the increase in production after the competition was launched, the capitalists' profits and workers' wages have increased. The Huadong Textile and Dyeing Factory's net profit in August increased by 60 percent compared to July before the competition, and workers' wages increased by 20 to 40 percent in August compared to July due to the implementation of the piece-rate progressive system. Therefore, both labor and capital in these factories have deeply realized the correctness of the "mutual benefit for labor and capital, development of production" policy in the Common Program in the competition, and have further enhanced the confidence of labor-capital unity and good production. Li Ruifeng, a worker at the Zhongsheng Textile and Dyeing Factory, said: We have all understood that today's competition in private factories should not be regarded as simply increasing the interests of the capitalists, but also creating wealth for the country and improving the lives of the workers themselves. The capitalists of the Fifties Publishing House are currently continuing to consult with the labor side on the competition, and are also negotiating in Shanghai to purchase universal typesetting machines and offset printing machines, as well as conducting a capital raising plan to expand production.

How do the factories carry out production competitions? As Zhang Zemin, manager of the Huadong Textile and Dyeing Factory, summarized his experience: "To run a factory well, it is necessary to sincerely consult with the labor side according to the principle of mutual benefit." Before the factories negotiate the competition, the trade union first strengthens the grass-roots organization of the workshop, and fully publicizes and mobilizes the workers. Then, after repeated discussions in the labor-management consultation meeting, the main contents of the consultation are: (1) Implementing a bonus for exceeding quotas or a piece-rate progressive wage system, (2) Establishing guarantee conditions for both parties, such as the labor side guaranteeing to meet certain output and quality standards, and the capital side guaranteeing to fully supply raw materials and machine parts of a certain quality. Some factories also stipulate these as production contracts, and both labor and capital act according to the contract.

The production competition in each factory is generally successful, which proves that it is possible to carry out production competition in private enterprises. However, some biases have also occurred in individual factories. Some workers did not correctly recognize that competition in private enterprises should also be a regular way of working, and only hoped to get more rewards at present, and rushed to work overtime to pursue production overruns. Some capitalists hoped to extend working hours and strengthen workers' labor intensity to gain more profits, and did not understand that production competition should be based on the rationalization of production management, the improvement of technology, and the improvement of operating methods. There are also individual factories that neglect quality in order to increase quantity. Some of these shortcomings have been corrected, and some still need to be seriously overcome in future competitions.

　　劳资协商会议积极发挥推进生产作用
    京部分私营工厂开展生产竞赛
    质量产量不断提高，建立新制度，改进经营管理。
    【京市新闻处讯】京市十余家私营工厂的劳资协商会议正进一步发挥推进生产的作用。自七月份以来，这些厂的工人在工会领导下，通过劳资协商会议与资方协商。本着劳资两利原则，订出双方保证条件，先后开展了生产竞赛，获得很大成绩。
    竞赛展开后，工人劳动热情高涨，自觉地加强劳动纪律，开动脑筋，改进操作方法，因此，劳动生产率和产品质量都有显著提高，同时节约了原料，降低了成本。以华东织染厂为例，工人织“八一”布的月产量，在五月份至七月份，平均每人每月四十匹，开展竞赛后提高到五十七·二匹，八、九两月份全厂产量连续超过计划，如八月份原计划织五五○匹，结果超过百分之十五·四。在质量方面，该厂次布率以前每月是百分之十三·六，八月份降低到百分之十·四，到九月份已降低到只有百分之一·六二了。该厂打轴打穗工人努力节约，认真从废料中挑拣有用材料，结果八月份的废料比七月份减少百分之二十，成本降低很大，如织药布每匹生产成本（除原料费以外）就由十五斤小米降低到十三·四斤。众生和经纬织染厂的产品质量提高最多，九月份里次布率已降低到百分之一。五十年代出版社印刷厂七、八、九三个月各部门大部超额完成生产计划，且质量提高，印书字迹比以前更加清晰，三个月来并节省不少油墨、煤油和纸张等原料。
    生产竞赛的更重要收获，是各厂经劳资协商，从摸索中建立了一些基本制度，促进经营管理的改善，扭转了这些工厂过去生产管理的松弛现象。华东织染厂建立了成品检查、废品展览和机器使用与检修制度，以保证产品质量和减少机器故障。此外，该厂还有生产进度图表，对鼓舞工人如期完成生产任务起了极大作用。五十年代出版社印刷厂各车间实行记工制度，工人每天填写生产报告表，厂长每星期检查一次生产进度，并加以公布，发生问题随时解决。
    由于开展竞赛后生产提高，资方利润和工人工资都有增加。华东织染厂资方八月份纯利就比竞赛前的七月份增多百分之六十，工人工资因实行计件累进制，八月份比七月份工资增多百分之二十到四十。因此这些工厂的劳资双方在竞赛中都深刻体会了共同纲领中“劳资两利、发展生产”政策的正确性，更增强了劳资团结、搞好生产的信心。众生织染厂工人李锐峰就说：我们大伙已经明白了，今天在私营工厂搞竞赛，不能看成光是给资方增加利益，也是给国家创造财富，给工人自己改善生活。五十年代出版社的资方现正和劳方继续协商竞赛，并在上海洽购万能铸字机和胶版机等，还进行吸收资金计划扩大生产。
    各厂是怎样开展生产竞赛的呢？正如华东织染厂经理张泽民总结了自己的经验所说：“要办好工厂，非按两利原则和劳方诚诚恳恳地协商不可。”各厂协商竞赛之前，工会首先健全车间基层组织，向职工群众作了充分的宣传鼓动，然后经过劳资协商会议反复讨论，协商的主要内容是：（一）实行超额奖励或计件累进工资制度，（二）订立双方保证条件，如劳方保证达到一定产量质量的标准，资方保证充分供应一定质量的原料和机器零件等，有些工厂还把这些订为生产合同，劳资双方根据合同办事。
    各厂的生产竞赛大体是成功的，这证明在私营企业中是可以开展生产竞赛的。但个别工厂也曾发生过一些偏向，有的工人没有正确认识竞赛在私营企业里也应该是经常的劳动方式，只是单纯希望目前多得报酬，为追求生产超额而突击加班，有的资方则希图以延长工时加强工人劳动强度好多获利润，不了解生产竞赛应建立在生产管理的合理化，改进技术、改进操作方法的基础上。还有个别工厂为了增加数量而忽视质量。这些缺点有的已经纠正，有的还须要在今后竞赛中认真克服。
