　　The Yellow River silted up the outlet to the sea
　　The Huai River is now a river without a tail. Its outlet to the sea was taken over by the Yellow River in the Ming Dynasty. Before losing its outlet to the sea, the Huai River, although it also flooded, did not cause much damage. Irrigation was convenient in the basin, and agricultural products were abundant. There was a saying, "Jianghuai rice and grain are fertile." Since 1194 (the fifth year of Shaoxi of Emperor Guangzong of the Southern Song Dynasty), when the Yellow River breached the old dike in Yangwu, part of the water flowed into the Huai River through the Nanqing River, the Huai River has often flooded and caused disasters. In 1493 (the sixth year of Hongzhi of Emperor Xiaozong of the Ming Dynasty), the water flowing north from the Yellow River was blocked, and the entire outlet of the Huai River was taken over. The Huai River had to find another way out, flooding farmland between Huaiyin, Hao, and Si, storing water flow, and later flooding Sizhou City, forming the present Hongze Lake with an area of about 2,700 square kilometers. After the Yellow River took over the Huai River, after 362 years, in 1855 (the fifth year of Xianfeng of the Qing Dynasty), it breached again in Tongwaxiang, and flowed into the sea along the current river course, but the remaining outlet of the Huai River had been silted up so high above the surrounding plains that it could not discharge the Huai River water flow. Since then, the disasters of the Huai River have become more serious. During the sixty-first year of Kangxi, it suffered a major flood on average every two years. From the eleventh year of Qianlong to the first year of Jiaqing, it suffered a major flood on average every three years for fifty years. From the twenty-fourth year of Daoguang to the seventh year of Guangxu, there was also a major flood on average every three years. The floods of 1916, 1921, 1926, and 1931 were even greater. Especially the one in 1931 (the twentieth year of the Republic of China) was the most serious. The flooded land in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu was 78 million mu, accounting for four-tenths of the cultivated land area of the Huai River basin. The number of victims was about 20 million, accounting for three-tenths of the population of the Huai River basin. According to the then prices, the estimated loss value was 600 million silver dollars.
　　Chiang Kai-shek left behind disaster
　　In 1938, Chiang Kai-shek dug up the Yellow River embankment at Huayuankou in Henan, and the Yellow River water, carrying sediment, poured into the Huai River from the Jialu River and the Ying River. The Yellow River entering the Huai River for eight years caused the northern tributaries of the Huai River to be silted up, the main stream to be shallow and blocked, and the Hongze Lake to be raised, destroying the entire Huai River water system; making the areas along the Huai River frequently suffer from floods. According to the statistics of the Henan Provincial Department of Agriculture in 1949: when the Yellow River breached its banks, more than 17 million mu of farmland in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu were flooded that year, and more than 6.1 million people were displaced. Although the Yellow River was brought back to its old course in 1947, the evil consequences it left behind contributed to this year's major flood in northern Anhui.
　　From late June to mid-July this year, the entire Huai River basin experienced continuous heavy rains, exceeding the rainfall during the same period in 1931.
　　From June 26th to July 5th, Xincai received 375 mm of rainfall, exceeding the July rainfall in 1931 by 55 mm; from June 27th to July 19th, Zhengyangguan received 628.3 mm of rainfall, exceeding the July rainfall in 1931 by 137.4 mm; from June 26th to July 20th, Bengbu received 532 mm of rainfall, exceeding the July rainfall in 1931 by 43.5 mm. Therefore, downstream of Zhengyangguan, the water level of the Huai River rose sharply, forming the highest flood peak on July 18th. The water level at Zhengyangguan was as high as 24.74 meters, which was 0.69 meters higher than the highest record in 1931. The river embankment overflowed and collapsed. The tributaries were unable to discharge because of the backwater of the dry river. More than 20 large and small tributaries in Anhui, such as Ying, Pai, Fei, Ci, Hui, and Tuo, also flooded. A total of 27 counties were flooded, 31.62 million mu of farmland, and 9.98 million people were affected by the disaster.
　　Excessively concentrated rainfall is the basic reason for this flood. The Yellow River's siltation of the river channel contributed to the formation of this disaster. Taking Bengbu as an example, the actual measured flood flow this year was 8,437 cubic meters per second, which was 188 cubic meters per second less than the highest record in 1931, but the water level exceeded the highest record in 1931 by 0.98 meters.
　　Natural Overview of the Huai River
　　The Huai River originates from the Tongbai Mountain in Henan, flowing about 375 kilometers to Honghekou. Entering Anhui Province, there are tributaries such as Hong, Ying, Fei, Wo, Hui, Tuo, and Sui in the north, and tributaries such as Shi, Pai, and Chi in the south, about 470 kilometers long, with a total basin area of 166,100 square kilometers. Hongze Lake originally had two outlets, one flowing from the Sanhe River through Gaoyou Lake and Baoying Lake, flowing south to Sanjiangying and entering the Yangtze River; the other flowing from the Zhangfu River, heading east to the sea, but this route is now blocked by silt.
　　The rainy season in the Huai River basin is in July and August. There are as many as 15 to 20 rainy days each month, and the maximum monthly rainfall ranges from 300 mm to 700 mm, averaging about 400 mm. There are also 24-hour rainfalls reaching more than 200 mm. The upper reaches of the Huai River are the Waifang Mountains in the northwest, the Funiu Mountains and Tongbai Mountains in the west, and the Dabie Mountains and Tianzhu Mountains in the southwest. The middle and lower reaches are a large plain with a very small slope, slow water flow, and poor drainage. The tributaries of the Huai River are also numerous, converging to the Huai River like spokes, and the floods of the tributaries almost simultaneously flow into the main river, creating a huge flow (the maximum flood volume of the Huai River is about 15,000 cubic meters per second). However, the main river channel from Honghekou to Hongze Lake can only accommodate half of the maximum flood volume, and the two outlets of Hongze Lake downstream are far from being able to discharge such a huge amount of water. Therefore, every time there is a flood, the water in the main river cannot be discharged, and the tributaries are also backwatered, so the main and tributaries of the Huai River flood at the same time, and Henan and northern Anhui are flooded everywhere.
　　When the water level of Hongze Lake rises, it directly threatens the Honghu Dike, and the amount of water flowing into Gaobao Lake through the Sanhe River also increases, which also raises the water level of the Liyun River, making the east bank of the canal subject to strong impact, increasing the risk of the canal flooding. In desperation, it is necessary to open the Guihai dams to divert floodwaters. East of the Guihai Dam, there is no waterway for drainage. After the dams are opened, the water flows on the plains, flooding farmland. If the dams are not opened, the east bank of the canal will collapse, and the Lixiahe area will be completely flooded, just like the situation in 1931, which would be even more harmful. The northern part of the Huai River basin produces wheat, beans, sorghum, and sesame. The southern part produces rice.
　　The Process of Harnessing the Huai River
　　In the late Qing Dynasty, the Huai River floods were serious, and many people called for harnessing the Huai River. In 1866 (the fifth year of Tongzhi), Ding Xian, the academic instructor of Suining County, proposed the idea of restoring the old course of the Huai River. The feudal ruling class, although also making a show of force and establishing a "Huai River Guidance Bureau," was unwilling to take out money. In 1906 (the thirty-second year of Guangxu), Zhang Jian wrote a letter to Duanfang, the Governor-General of Liangjiang, on the comprehensive treatment of the Huai River, combining guidance and prevention. Duanfang, in order to cover people's eyes, secretly ordered surveyors to raise the old Yellow River channel near Andong on the survey map, saying that the riverbed was too high and the project could not be carried out.
　　In the early years of the Republic of China, the warlords occupying the Huai River basin attempted to use the name of harnessing the Huai River to obtain loans as capital for civil war. Thus, there was the Huai River diversion into the Yangtze River plan after the investigation by the American Red Cross Engineering Corps in 1914. In 1919, Guangyi Bank's representative, hydraulic engineer Freeman, surveyed the Huai River and the canal, and proposed the plan of diverting the Huai River into the sea. At that time, the Anhui Water Conservancy Bureau and the National Water Conservancy Bureau also formulated plans. For a time, there was a high cry for harnessing the Huai River, but no action was taken. In 1929, the Kuomintang government also established the Huai River Guidance Committee. After eight years of guidance, floods continued, and there was no achievement. Instead, in 1938, the Yellow River was breached, bringing greater difficulties to the treatment of the Huai River.
　　In the past, the plans for guiding and treating the Huai River were roughly of three types: diversion into the Yangtze River, diversion into the sea, and diversion into both the Yangtze River and the sea. Each plan had different opinions on the route of diversion and treatment, but most of them focused on整治尾闾, urgently finding a way out for the flood. They only paid attention to the prevention and control of water disasters, and ignored the aspect of promoting benefits. In October 1931, the Huai River Guidance Committee proposed a Huai River diversion plan that focused on flood control, while taking into account farmland irrigation and navigation. It advocated the principle of diverting into both the Yangtze River and the sea. The plan was to sort out the waterway into the Yangtze River to discharge 6,000 to 9,000 cubic meters per second, and the remaining water would be stored in Hongze Lake. In order to keep the water level of Hongze Lake from exceeding 16 meters, it was necessary to open up a waterway into the sea, with the engineering standard of discharging 1,500 cubic meters per second when the water level of Hongze Lake was at 15 meters. In the middle and upper reaches, the plan was to straighten the bends and widen the narrow river channels. At the same time, gates were set up in the main river to facilitate navigation and divert the water from Hongze Lake and the Central Canal to irrigate 40 million mu of farmland. Although this plan was slightly more progressive than the past, the main thing was still passive prevention and control. However, under the past reactionary rule, even this passive prevention and control plan was impossible to complete.

　　淮河
    萧颖
    黄河淤填了出海道
    淮河现在是一条没有尾巴的河流，它的出海道在明朝就被黄河夺去了。在没有失去出海道以前，淮河虽然也有泛滥，但为害不大。流域内灌溉便利，农产丰富，有“江淮稻粮肥”的谚语。自一一九四年（南宋光宗绍熙五年）黄河在阳武故堤决口，一部分水经南清河流入淮河后，淮河才常常泛滥成灾。到了一四九三年（明孝宗宏治六年）黄河北流的水被堵塞，淮河的入海道全部被夺去。淮水就只好另找出路，把淮阴、濠、泗间的农田淹没，储蓄水流，后来又淹了泗洲城，形成今日约二千七百平方公里的洪泽湖。黄河夺淮后，经过三百六十二年，到一八五五年（清咸丰五年）又在铜瓦厢决口，循现在的河道入海，但所留下的淮河入海道已被淤塞的高出两岸平地，不能排泄淮河水流了。从此以后，淮河的灾患更加严重。康熙六十一年间，平均两年遭一次大水。乾隆十一年至嘉庆元年五十年间平均三年遭一次大水。道光二十四年到光绪七年，也是平均三年一次大水。一九一六年、一九二一年、一九二六年、一九三一年的几次水灾更大。尤其是一九三一年的（民国二十年）最重。豫、皖、苏三省被淹田地七千八百万亩，占淮河流域耕地面积的十分之四。灾民约两千万，占淮河流域人口的十分之三。按当时物价估计损失值六亿元银币。
    蒋介石留下的灾难
    一九三八年，蒋介石在河南花园口掘开黄河大堤，黄水挟泥沙从贾鲁河、颍河倾泻入淮。黄河入淮八年，使淮河北部支流淤塞，干流浅阻，洪泽湖垫高，破坏了淮河水系的全部；使沿淮各地经常遭受水患。据一九四九年河南省农业厅统计：黄河决口时，豫皖苏三省当年就有一千七百余万亩农田被淹，六百一十余万人民流离失所。黄河虽于一九四七年挽回故道，但它所留下的恶果却促成了今年皖北大水灾。
    今年六月下旬到七月中旬，淮河流域全境连续暴雨，超过一九三一年同时期降雨量。
    新蔡六月二十六日到七月五日降雨三七五公厘，超过一九三一年七月雨量五五公厘；正阳关六月二十七到七月十九日降雨六二八·三公厘，超过一九三一年七月一三七·四公厘；蚌埠六月二十六日到七月二十日降雨五三二公厘，超过一九三一年七月四三·五公厘。因此正阳关以下，淮河水位直线上升，七月十八日形成最高洪水峰，正阳关水位高达二四·七四公尺，比一九三一年最高纪录高出○·六九公尺。河堤遂漫溢溃决。各支流受干河水流顶托，不能下泄。皖境颍、渒、淝、茨、浍、沱……二十余条大小支流也全部泛滥。共淹了二十七县，三千一百六十二万亩农田，九百九十八万人受灾。
    雨量集中过巨乃是造成此次水灾的基本原因。黄河淤高河道助长了这次灾难的形成，以蚌埠为例，本年实测洪水流量为八四三七秒立方公尺，比一九三一年最高纪录少一八八秒立方公尺，而水位却超过了一九三一年最高纪录的○·九八公尺。
    淮河的自然概况
    淮河发源于河南桐柏山，流到洪河口约三百七十五公里。入安徽境，北有洪、颍、淝、涡、浍、沱、濉等支河，南有史、渒、池等支流，长约四百七十公里，流域面积共十六万六千一百平方公里。洪泽湖原有两个出口，一从三河流经高邮湖宝应湖，南流至三江营入长江；一从张福河，东行入海，但此路现已淤阻。
    淮河流域七八月为多雨季节，每月下雨天多达十五天到二十天，每月最大雨量从三百公厘到七百公厘不等，平均约四百公厘左右。也有二十四小时暴雨量达到二百公厘以上的。淮河上游西北是外方山脉，西部是伏牛山脉和桐柏山脉，西南是大别山脉和天柱山脉。中下游是一片大平原，坡度很小，水流缓慢，宣泄不畅。淮河的支流又很多，像车辐似地向淮河集中，各支流的洪水，几乎同时注入干河，造成巨大的流量（按淮河最大洪水量约在一万五千秒公方左右）。可是自洪河口到洪泽湖的干流河槽仅能容最大洪水量的一半，而下游洪泽湖的两个出口，又远不能排出如此巨大水量。于是每遇洪水时，干河水不能泄出，各支流也被顶托倒灌，于是淮河干支流同时泛滥，河南、皖北遍地成灾。
    洪泽湖水位升高时，直接威胁着洪湖大堤，其经三河流入高宝湖的水量也加多，同时抬高了里运河的水位，使运河东堤受大力撞击，加大了运河泛滥的危险，在不得已时，只好开放归海各坝，分泄洪水。归海坝以东，并无泄水的河运，开坝后，水行平地，淹没农田。如不开坝，运河东堤溃决，里下河一带将全淹没，像一九三一年的情形，为害就更大了。淮河流域北部产麦、豆、高粱、芝麻。南部产水稻。
    治淮的经过
    清末时，淮河水患严重，许多人呼吁治淮。一八六六年（同治五年）睢宁县学训导丁显提出复淮故道的意见。封建统治阶级，虽也虚张声势，成立“导淮局”，但不愿拿出钱来。一九○六年（光绪三十二年）张謇作导淮标本兼治文上书两江总督端方，端方为遮人耳目，密令测量员加高测绘图上安东一带的旧黄河道，说河身太高，工程不能举办。
    民国初年，盘据淮河流域的军阀则企图以治淮为名，取得借款，作为内战的资本。于是有一九一四年美国红十字会工程团调查后的导淮入江计划。一九一九年广益银公司代表水利工程师费礼门勘查淮河运河后的导淮入海计划。当时安徽水利局、全国水利局也订出计划。一时治淮呼声很高，却不见行动。一九二九年国民党政府，也成立了导淮委员会。导了八年，水灾还是不断，并没有任何成绩。却在一九三八年扒开了黄河，给治理淮河带来了更大的困难。
    过去导治淮河的计划，大致不外三种：入江、入海、江海分疏，每个计划主张导治的路线又各有不同，但大部偏重于整治尾闾，急急于给洪水找出路。仅仅注意到水害的防治，而忽略了兴利一方面。一九三一年十月导淮委员会提出以防洪为主，并顾及农田灌溉及航运的导淮计划，主张以江海分疏为原则，整理入江水道泄水六千到九千秒立方公尺，下剩的水量蓄于洪泽湖。为保持洪泽湖水位不超过十六公尺，故开辟入海水道，以洪泽湖水位在十五公尺时泄水一千五百秒立方公尺为工程标准。中上游则裁弯取直，开宽过狭河道。同时在干河设闸便利航运，引洪泽湖及中运河水灌田四千万亩。这一计划虽较过去稍见进步，主要的还是消极防治。但在过去的反动统治下，就连这一消极防治的计划也是不可能完成的。
