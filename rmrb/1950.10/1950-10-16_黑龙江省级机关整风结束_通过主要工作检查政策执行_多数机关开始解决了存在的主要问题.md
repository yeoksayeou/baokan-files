[Reported by our special correspondent Yin Can]: The rectification movement for cadres in Heilongjiang Province's provincial-level organs, which began on July 1st and lasted for two months, concluded at the end of August. Following this rectification, the vast majority of organs in the province have to varying degrees begun to resolve the major problems existing in the leadership of their respective departments, as well as the ideological and work style issues of key responsible cadres. The problems in the Department of Agriculture and Forestry were unrealistic production plans and poor production management; the leadership lacked investigation and research into conditions at the grassroots level and had a tendency to boast and exaggerate, resulting in the failure to properly implement production plans or accurately understand the extent of their implementation. For example, this year's spring plowing plan and soybean and wheat planting plans were not well executed due to their lack of practicality. Furthermore, many of the improved agricultural tools promoted did not work, resulting in wasted labor and resources and leaving a negative impression on the masses. These problems began to surface in the spring of this year, and even more problems were discovered when the department assisted in inspecting Zhao Guang Farm in May. At the beginning of the rectification, the key responsible comrades of the department earnestly recognized these problems, so the examination and summarization proceeded relatively quickly. When the Department of Commerce began its rectification, everyone had opinions about individual cadres, focusing on tracing personal responsibility. After discovering this, the Provincial Party Committee promptly guided the department to shift its focus to examining its work, specifically pointing out: "Focus on examining the province, focus on examining yourselves, do not push responsibility upward or downward, and proceed from the goal of improving future commercial work." During the examination, the department recognized that the stagnation of commodity sales in April and May of this year, the lack of outlets for grain, pork, and eggs, and the widespread complaints of farmers lacking cash, were a comprehensive manifestation of the serious problems existing in commercial work; commercial work lagged behind the new national commercial and market situation, which demonstrated insufficient implementation of the policy of serving industrial and agricultural production and serving the production and life of the broad masses of workers and peasants. The department also failed to provide adequate support for the cooperative economy and harbored "squeezing" thoughts towards private merchants. In the work of the Department of Finance, there was insufficient mass perspective and a tendency towards a purely financial viewpoint. Initially, the leadership of the department believed that financial work inevitably attracted criticism and that "across-the-board deductions" were a way to save money for the state. Later, with the specific assistance of the overall leadership, the Department of Finance first made a self-criticism, which was well received by everyone, and from this, began to examine these problems. This also promoted the rectification of its affiliated enterprises, companies, tax bureaus, and grain bureaus. Because problems could begin to be resolved during the rectification, the enthusiasm of all working comrades (including non-Party members) was greatly increased. The relationship between leaders and those being led became closer than before. Furthermore, because this rectification involved examining policy viewpoints through specific work, the general comrades gained a further understanding of the policies. Some relatively backward Party member cadres also began to transform. For example, a section chief in the Department of Civil Affairs who had said, "The section chief, the section chief, lies on the kang, with section members below and the department head above," has now begun to change. At the same time, some systems for improving work were established. Therefore, this rectification generally achieved the goals of "examining work, improving work, and educating cadres and the masses."

Comrade Zhao Dezun, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee, summarized the experiences of this rectification in the provincial-level organs. The main points are as follows:

1.  Closely integrate with the examination of work. At the beginning of the rectification, the province did not have a sufficient understanding of Chairman Mao's instructions: "Carry out a large-scale rectification movement in close combination with various work tasks, rather than in separation." It was not until after listening to Comrade Gao Gang's "July 1st" rectification report and comprehending the hint of "closely integrating with the examination of work" that the old set of rectification plans and practices of "dividing into stages, reading documents, writing self-examinations, and making assessments" was thoroughly changed. First, mobilize and enlighten from top to bottom, with the Provincial Party Committee making enlightening reports on the main problems existing in the work of each department. The responsible comrades of each department made enlightening reports on the examination of the work of their own departments, after a period of deliberation. Then, launch the examination of work from bottom to top, widely solicit opinions, grasp the key points, and conduct in-depth research. In this way, "unled, saying whatever comes to mind" and losing the direction of the rectification can be avoided; and "focusing exclusively on trivial life matters" or "allowing individuals to vent their grievances" and losing the focus of the rectification can also be avoided. Individual departments had similar shortcomings in the short term, but they were all corrected in a timely manner.

2.  Closely grasp the leading backbone, implement key assistance, and combine it with mobilizing all Party member cadres. The larger and more decisive reports in the rectification were all put forward after the Provincial Party Committee and the responsible comrades of each department held discussions and exchanged opinions. The Provincial Party Committee's rectification report on delving deeper into the second stage, "grasp the key, find the reasons, think of solutions," also concentrated materials at the symposium of key cadres and took the lead in solving the key problems of each department. This method enabled the responsible comrades of each department to receive assistance from the Provincial Party Committee, and the Provincial Party Committee also understood the situation of each department, exchanged experiences with each other, cultivated the rectification backbone, and jointly led the rectification. For some departments that could not solve difficult problems at the symposium, specific key assistance was adopted. When individual leading comrades lacked sufficient understanding of the key problems of their own departments or could not make the turn, individual assistance was most needed. In addition, convening special meetings of various departments to coordinate with improving work and examining provincial-level leadership had a very good effect. The Provincial Party Committee convened a provincial-level county cadre meeting in late July, and the Department of Finance, the Department of Commerce, and the Provincial Cooperative General Agency also convened similar meetings, all of which played a significant role.

3.  Under leadership, fully promote democracy and carry out criticism and self-criticism throughout the Party. During the rectification, some individual comrades attempted to suppress criticism. When others offered criticism, they did not dare to oppose it head-on, but instead sought out "individual talks" afterward, or passed a note when others spoke: "Please be more objective in your speech!" This phenomenon was criticized by the Party, ensuring the smooth unfolding of criticism and self-criticism within the Party. In order to make it fully active and constructive, it must be conducted in a led and organized manner, with some erroneous opinions corrected in a timely manner, and the phenomena of extreme democracy and tailism prevented.

4.  The ideological guidance in the rectification lies in grasping the main key problems. Rectification is for the purpose of doing a good job, and going from general inspection to grasping the key is a process of analytical research and thinking. Comprehending and recognizing the key problems in one's own work is also a process. The first step of this rectification, initially reading documents and coordinating with preliminary inspection work; and the second step, in-depth "grasping the key, finding the reasons, and thinking of solutions," are in line with the laws of development. The fact that the leading comrades of each department began to improve ideologically means that they had broken through ideologically on the key issues.

5.  A better conclusion lies in finding out the reasons and improving methods, and specifically stipulating them in future work plans and work systems. At the same time, it is reflected in the ideological awareness of the leadership and the consistent exchange of experiences among all Party comrades. The purpose of this rectification is to demand unity of the whole Party, unity between the Party and the masses, and improve work. Therefore, after each department summarized the rectification among all comrades, they immediately organized discussions to exchange rectification experiences, so that information could be communicated from top to bottom, the whole Party became more united, the relationship between the Party and the masses became closer, there were methods for improving work, and there was also full work enthusiasm.

Comrade Zhao Dezun also pointed out in the rectification summary that the problems raised in this rectification in the province still need to be improved and implemented through hard work in the future. Many of the problems examined in the rectification are common basic problems that cannot be solved all at once. It is manifested in: 1. Blindness and one-sidedness in the implementation of policies; 2. Insufficient mass perspective and mass line; 3. The leadership style is not in-depth, and there is a general problem (this is a relatively common and concrete manifestation of bureaucratism existing in the leadership of the province); 4. The ideological awareness and education of Party member cadres need to be improved and strengthened urgently. These must continue to be improved in future work.

　　黑龙江省级机关整风结束
    通过主要工作检查政策执行
    多数机关开始解决了存在的主要问题
    【本报讯】本报特约记者殷参报道：黑龙江省省级机关干部整风自七月一日开始，历时两月，至八月底结束。该省经过此次整风后，绝大多数机关在不同程度上开始解决了各该部门领导上存在的主要问题，和主要负责干部的思想作风问题。农林厅问题是生产计划不切合实际，生产管理差；领导对下情缺乏调查研究，好大喜功，以致生产计划不能很好实现，或实现多少亦不能确切了解。譬如今年的春耕计划、豆麦播种计划等等，都因不够切实而未能很好完成。又如推广的改良农具，其中有相当一部分未起作用，结果劳民伤财，给群众留下不好的影响。这些问题从今年春天就开始暴露了，五月份该厅在帮助检查赵光农场时，发现的问题更多。在整风开始时，该厅主要负责同志，就切实地认识到这些问题，所以检查总结起来，也就比校快。商业厅开始整风时，大家对个别干部有意见，集中力量追查个人责任。省委发现后及时引导转向检查工作，并具体指出：“着重检查省，着重检查自己，不上推，不下推，一切为搞好今后商业工作出发。”检查中该厅认识到：今年四、五月份商品滞销，粮食、猪肉、鸡蛋没有出路，农民手里没现款到处叫苦，这是商业工作中存在的严重问题的总暴露；商业工作落后于新的国家商业与市场情况，这表现了对为工农业生产服务，为广大工农劳动人民生产与生活服务的方针贯彻不够。该厅对合作经济的扶助也没有作好，对私商有“挤”的思想。财政厅的工作中表现群众观点不够，有单纯财政观点。开始该厅领导上认为财政工作免不了挨骂，“平均扣”也是给国家节省。后来经过总的领导上的具体帮助，财政厅首先作了检讨，大家反映很好，由此开始检查这些问题。并推动了所属企业公司、税务局、粮食局的整风。由于在整风中能够开始解决问题，所以全体工作同志（包括非党群众）的积极性大为提高。领导与被领导的关系较前密切起来。又由于这次整风是通过具体工作检查政策观点，使一般同志对政策有了进一步的认识。有些比较落后的党员干部也开始转变。如说过“科长科长，炕上一躺，下有科员，上有厅长”的民政厅某科长，现已开始转变。同时又定出了一些改进工作的制度。因此，这次整风一般的达到“检查工作，改进工作，教育干部和群众”的目的。
    该省省委书记赵德尊同志曾总结这次省级机关整风经验。主要的有以下几点：
    一、紧密的结合检查工作。整风开始，该省对毛主席的指示：“在和各项工作任务密切地相结合而不是相分离的条件下，进行一次大规模的整风运动”，了解不够，直到听了高岗同志“七一”整风报告，领会“紧密的结合检查工作”的提示以后，才彻底的改变了“分阶段，读文件，写反省，做鉴定”这老一套的整风计划和作法。首先自上而下的动员启发，由省委针对各部门工作中间存在的主要问题作启发性的报告。各部门负责同志针对本部门的工作检查，经过一定的酝酿，作启发性的报告。然后，发动自下而上的检查工作，广泛的提出意见，抓住重点，深入研究。这样，可以避免“无领导的有啥说啥”，迷失整风方向；也可以避免“专扣生活琐事”或“任凭个人发牢骚”，失去整风重点。个别部门在短时期内曾有类似的缺点，也都及时得到纠正。
    二、抓紧领导骨干实行重点帮助，与发动全体党员干部相结合。整风中较大的带决定性的报告，都是省委与各部门负责同志座谈交换意见后提出的。省委关于深入第二阶段的整风报告“抓关键，找原因，想办法”，也是在主要干部的座谈会上集中材料并先一步解决各部门的关键问题。这种方法使各部门负责同志得到省委的帮助，省委也了解了各部门的情况，互相交流了经验，培养了整风骨干，又共同的领导了整风。对座谈会上不能解决困难问题的某些部门，就采取具体的重点帮助。当个别领导同志对于本部门的关键问题认识不足或转不过弯的时期，最需要个别帮助。再就是召开各部门专门会议配合改进工作与检查省级领导，效果很好。省委曾于七月下旬召开全省县干部会议，财政厅、商业厅和省合作总社也都召开过类似的会议，都起了很大的作用。
    三、有领导的充分发扬民主，开展全党的批评与自我批评。整风中曾有个别同志企图压制批评，当别人提出批评时不敢正面反对，却在事后找去“个别谈话”，或在别人发言时递个条子：“请你讲话客观点！”这种现象受到党的批判，保证了党内批评与自我批评的顺利展开。为了使它具备充分的积极性和建设性，必须有领导的有组织的进行，有些错误的意见及时得到改正，极端民主和尾巴主义的现象得以防止。
    四、整风中的思想指导，在于抓住主要的关键问题。整风是为了搞好工作，由一般检查到抓住关键是一个分析研究的思考过程。体会与认识到本身工作中的关键问题，也是一个过程。这次整风的第一步，初读文件，配合初步检查工作；第二步，深入的“抓关键，找原因，想办法”，是合乎规律的。各部门领导同志在思想上开始有所提高，也就是在关键问题上打通了思想。
    五、较好的结束，在于找出原因和改进办法，并具体规定在今后工作计划中与工作制度里。同时，表现在领导思想上的觉悟和全党同志的心得交流一致。这次整风的目的是要求全党团结，党群团结，提高工作。因此，各部门在全体同志中通过整风总结之后，立即组织座谈，交谈整风心得，使得上下通气，全党更加团结，党群关系更加密切，有了改进工作的办法，同时有了饱满的工作热情。
    赵德尊同志并在整风总结时指出：该省在这次整风中所提出的问题，还需要今后努力改进与贯彻。整风中检查出来的毛病，很多是带有共通性的基本毛病，不是一下子就能解决得了的。它表现在：一、执行政策上的盲目性和片面性；二、群众观点和群众路线不够；三、领导作风不深入，一般化的毛病（这是官僚主义在该省领导上现实存在的较为普遍的具体表现）；四、党员干部的思想觉悟与教育亟须提高与加强。这些都必须在今后工作中，继续改进的。
