Editor's Note: This article is excerpted from a letter from Comrade Ma Guorui, Deputy Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, to Comrade Liu Lantao, Third Secretary of the North China Bureau, regarding the rectification movement. Although the article describes the situation before September, these problems have not been completely resolved in the rectification movement in some areas, and are therefore still worth considering by various regions.

(1) Checking and summarizing work is the purpose of studying documents and the result of linking the study of documents with reality. Therefore, the checking work should be carried out in a timely manner after carefully studying certain documents, and linking them with work, thought, and style to conduct deliberation, and without conflicting with the current central work. If these conditions are not met, it is better to postpone it. After the checking begins, leadership, thought, and time should be concentrated as much as possible to complete it in one go. Avoid unprepared, rash checking, or lax and protracted delays. For example, within the Transportation Bureau, there were two opinions on the work, and they argued with each other without resolution, and the director and deputy director also had different understandings of the issue. The provincial leadership simply ordered it to stop and wait until the director and deputy director reached a consensus before proceeding with checking and summarizing. During the tense times of flood prevention and insect control, the Provincial Party Committee temporarily ordered the prefectural and county committees to stop checking, so as not to affect the completion of urgent tasks.

(2) Regarding the order of checking, according to the materials of the directly affiliated units of the Provincial Party Committee and the Dingxian Prefecture, there are two situations: One is that after mastering the ideas of the documents, the leadership first convenes core cadres based on the problems raised by everyone when studying the documents and linking them with reality, to conduct research and make an enlightening report with a focus and content on self-criticism (the more profound this report, the better), and then unfold the checking from top to bottom.

The other is the step-by-step checking work from bottom to top, from section to division, from division to department, checking the leadership, and finally the leadership summarizes, analyzes, discusses, and then makes a self-critical report (such as the Department of Industry).

The advantage of the first method is: first, it makes everyone clear about the focus and direction of the checking work of the unit, and the speech will not be boundless and lose the center. Second, it can play the role of gradual enlightenment, eliminate the general cadres' concerns about the leaders, so that everyone can speak freely, and can be more calm and objective. Third, it can give full play to the role of leadership, for example, after discussing the department's report, the responsible comrades of the department can take the initiative to lead the checking of the division (or section). According to the experience of the Department of Industry and the Public Security Bureau of Dingxian Prefecture, the leadership direction and the focus of the checking cannot be clarified in a timely manner, which easily makes the leadership passive, and the lower levels blindly check, with trivial details, boundless, and unable to grasp the main problems. Generally speaking, this approach is not successful.

(3) The key issues of the checking work. According to reports from various places, at the beginning of the checking work, it is often unclear what to check, and where to put the focus, and there is suffering of not knowing where to start. The Dingxian Prefectural Party Committee had disputes on this issue. Some advocated "checking several, or two or three important tasks." If what is proposed is indeed important work, this is of course correct. But some also advocated "a comprehensive and systematic check of all tasks," which is impossible to achieve; if it is forced, it will inevitably be an egalitarian check, and will not be able to grasp the main problems existing in the current work.

Where should the checking work start? First of all, we should focus on checking the degree to which the department has implemented policies and carried out work tasks, then check the work and leadership of the department, and finally link the necessary related individuals. Because once the main problems are solved, some minor problems can be solved together, and it will naturally be linked to individual responsibilities and rights and wrongs. We must grasp the key points and not try to solve all the problems at once. From the perspective of the entire province, the focus is on overcoming commandism and bureaucracy in terms of style, and the focus of the checking should be placed on leading organs and leading cadres above the county level. The most central issue in the checking work of each county is production, and other issues should be resolved around production. Because this is the urgent demand of the masses, and it is also the main purpose of why we oppose bureaucracy and commandism. Out of 150 proposals from the people's representatives of Dingxian County, 81 were related to agricultural production. These proposals criticized the shortcomings and errors of our commandism and bureaucracy in leading production, not proceeding from the actual situation, and disregarding the farming season. Someone said: "'Clearly, Xiaoman flowers don't go home', but you insist on saying: 'Xiaoman flowers are pulled by big carts'; clearly, 'Lixia is the right time to plant flowers', but you insist on saying: 'Guyu is the right time to plant flowers'." Some people reflected that now the lower levels are afraid of being "models" and "base points". In Zhaicheng, Dingxian County, there were 20 incidents of people going to collect materials in one month. According to village cadres and the masses, "Real models and base points are useless!" According to the key checks in Jianguo and Hejian counties, there is a large difference between the originally reported cotton field area and the actual planted area. The original report of 11 villages in Jianguo was 1,909.8 mu, while the actual planted area was 867.7 mu. The Provincial Party Committee has informed the prefectural, municipal, and county party committees that the checking work must focus on projects that lead production.

(4) Checking and summarizing work should be realistic and proceed from the actual situation, and formalism, empiricism, and one-sidedness must be opposed. Regarding formalism, in addition to correcting the shortcomings of copying the instructions and resolutions of higher authorities and turning the rectification plan into a lengthy article, we must also oppose the so-called "comprehensive and systematic check and summary of all work". Because this is impossible to achieve. Such a check will inevitably become formalism. For example, Quyang County checked: industry, agriculture, culture and education, justice, and public security, five major items, and each item has several sub-items. At the same time, it is also necessary to prevent not grasping the rectification tightly, lacking confidence, and as a result, although there is no deviation, there is no effect, and it passes by plainly. This kind of rectification in name only is also formalism.

The manifestations of empiricism are: some units in Dingxian Prefecture (prefecture bank) carried out personal ideological checks at the beginning, instead of first checking the main problems existing in the current work of the department, and did not understand that linking the checking of individuals from the checking and summarizing work is one of the characteristics of this rectification. Some units even mechanically moved the experience of party rectification in 1948, focusing on personal checks at the beginning, finding people with many mistakes as "key people", organizing backbones, and holding meetings of activists to rectify. The Provincial Party Committee has notified various places to prevent these empiricist practices.

The checking work must affirm achievements and criticize shortcomings, and neither can be neglected. Since our achievements are the main aspect of our work, we should first affirm the achievements and prove the achievements with concrete facts. But the general rule is that the checking tends to focus on shortcomings at the beginning, which is not terrible. But it is necessary to gradually guide everyone to correctly recognize the achievements and shortcomings through leadership enlightenment and the activities of activists.

Finally, while overcoming and preventing the above-mentioned errors and deviations, the most important thing is to introduce some successful experiences from the positive side. For example, to oppose formalism and empiricism, we should introduce some examples of proceeding from reality from the positive side. To overcome coercion and command, we must carry out education on how to follow the mass line from the positive side. In this way, comrades will not feel that "there is more criticism and less help".

### 河北省整风运动中  检查总结工作的初步经验

　　河北省整风运动中
    检查总结工作的初步经验
    编者按：本文摘自中共河北省委副书记马国瑞同志关于整风问题给华北局第三书记刘澜涛同志的信。文中所述虽为九月份以前的情况，但这些问题在有些地区的整风运动中仍未完全解决，故仍值得各地参考。
    （一）检查总结工作，是学习文件的目的，又是学习文件联系实际的结果。因此，检查工作应该在精读一定文件，联系工作、思想、作风进行酝酿，并与当前中心工作不相违背的条件下，及时进行。如果这些条件不具备，宁可推迟进行。开始检查之后，就应集中领导，集中思想，集中时间，尽可能一气呵成。切忌没有准备、冒冒失失的检查，或松懈拖拉延长时间。例如交通局内部对工作有两种意见，互相争论，不得解决，正副局长对问题的认识亦不一致。省领导上干脆令其停止，待正副局长意见一致后再进行检查总结。在防汛、捕虫紧张时候，省委会暂时令地委、县委停止检查。以免影响紧急任务的完成。
    （二）在检查的顺序上，据省委直属单位及定县专区材料看，有以下两种情况：一种是掌握文件的思想后，先由领导上根据大家学习文件联系实际时提出的问题，召集核心干部加以研究，作有重点有内容的自我检讨的启发报告（这种报告愈深刻愈好），然后自上而下展开检查。
    另一种是自下而上的由科而处由处而厅的逐级检查工作，检查领导，最后由领导上归纳分析讨论，再作自我批评性的报告（如工业厅）。
    第一种方法的好处是：首先使大家明确了本单位的检查工作重点和方向，发言不致漫无边际，失掉中心。其次，可起逐级启发之效，解除一般干部对领导者的顾虑，使大家畅所欲言，并可较为冷静客观。第三，可以充分发挥领导的作用，例如对厅的报告讨论后，厅负责同志即可主动的领导检查处（或科）。后一种方法，据工业厅及定县专区公安处的经验，领导方针、检查重点不能及时明确，容易使领导陷于被动，下边盲目检查，枝枝节节，漫无边际，抓不住主要问题。一般说，这种作法是不成功的。
    （三）检查工作的重点问题。据各地报告，检查工作开始，检查什么，重点放到何处，多不明确，有无从下手之苦。定县地委对此问题发生争论，有的主张“检查几项，或两三项重要工作”。只要所提出的确是重要工作，这当然是正确的。但也有的主张“全面系统的检查各项工作”，这是不可能做到的；如果硬做，必然是平均主义式的检查，而抓不住当前工作中存在的主要问题。
    检查工作从何着手？首先应有重点地从本部门对政策贯彻与工作任务的执行程度着手检查，然后检查部门的工作与领导，最后联系必要的有关的个人。因为主要问题解决了，一些次要的问题就可以连带解决，也自然就联系到个人的责任与是非。必须抓紧重点，不要希图把所有问题一齐解决。就全省总的来说，在作风上，中心是克服命令主义、官僚主义，检查重点应放到县以上的领导机关和领导干部。各县检查工作，最中心的问题是生产，其他问题应围绕生产来解决。因为这是群众的迫切要求，也是我们之所以反对官僚主义、命令主义的主要目的。定县人民代表一百五十件提案中有八十一件是农业生产方面的。这些提案批评了我们领导生产中的命令主义、官僚主义，不从实际情况出发，和不顾农时的缺点和错误，有人说：“‘明明是小满花不回家’，你们硬说：‘小满花大车拉’；明明是‘立夏种花正当时’，却硬说：‘谷雨种花正当时’”。有人反映现在下边怕当“模范”，怕当“基点”，定县翟城一个月中有二十起人去搜集材料。据村干群众反映：“真模范、基点不起！”另据建国、河间两县重点检查，原报棉田数与实种数相差很大。建国十一村原报一、九○九点八亩，实种八六七点七亩。省委已告地、市、县委，检查工作必须把重点放在领导生产的项目上。
    （四）检查总结工作，要作到实事求是，从实际情况出发，必须反对形式主义、经验主义及片面性。关于形式主义，除照抄上级指示及决议，把整风计划弄成长篇大论的缺点必须纠正外，还要反对所谓“全面系统的检查总结所有工作”。因为这是不可能作到的。这样的检查，必然成为形式主义。如曲阳县检查：工业、农业、文教、司法、治安五大项，各项下又列有若干细目。同时也要防止对整风抓得不紧，信心不足，结果虽未出偏差，但亦无成效，而平平淡淡地过去了。这种有名无实的整风，同样是形式主义。
    经验主义的表现有：定县专区有的单位（分区银行），一开始就进行个人思想检查，而不是首先检查本部门的当前工作中存在的主要问题，没有领会到从检查总结工作中联系检查个人是这次整风特点之一。有些单位甚至机械的搬运一九四八年整党时的经验，一开始就着重个人检查，找出错误多的人作为“重点人”，组织骨干，开积极分子会议来整。对这些经验主义作法，省委已通报各地防止。
    检查工作必须是肯定成绩，批评缺点，两者不可偏废。既然我们的工作中成绩是主要的，就应首先肯定成绩，并用具体事实证明成绩。但一般的规律是开始检查多偏重缺点，这也不可怕。但是必须经过领导启发与积极分子的活动，逐渐引导大家正确认识成绩与缺点。
    最后，在克服与防止上述错误偏向的同时，最重要的是从正面介绍一些成功的经验，例如，反对形式主义、经验主义，就应该从正面介绍一些从实际出发的例子。克服强迫命令，就必须从正面进行怎样走群众路线的教育。这样，就不致使同志们感到“批评多，帮助少”。
