Xinhua News Agency, London, October 6th: A mass meeting convened by the London District Committee of the British Communist Party to protest American aggression against Korea was held on October 5th in central London. Gollan, Deputy Editor of the "Daily Worker," spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that the Americans want to conquer the entire Korean peninsula and use it as a base for a third world war. He said, "The Koreans want peace, but they will never accept the peace of an American graveyard."

	Gollan urged everyone to launch a labor movement to demand an end to the war in Korea and the establishment of a unified, democratic republic of Korea. Referring to the foreign policy debate at the Labour Party Annual Conference, Gollan pointed out that half of the Labour Party's local organizations opposed the Labour government's foreign policy.

	Lyddon, a young engineer, called for learning from the example of British dockworkers who refused to load munitions for the attack on Soviet Russia in 1920, and to stop the war against Korea.

	Maho, Secretary of the London District Committee of the British Communist Party, told the assembly: The British people are being used as tools of the United States, driven to participate in criminal adventures, and losing everything themselves. Maho called on everyone to support the Second World Peace Congress to be held in Britain in November.

	The mass meeting passed a resolution saying: "This assembly of Londoners demands that the Labour government take all actions to unite the peace-loving British people and stop the crisis of another world war. For world peace, we declare that the aggression of American imperialism against the Korean people must be stopped, and all British troops must return home immediately. We demand that the government strive for a peaceful settlement of the war, which is to immediately cease fire, withdraw all foreign troops, allow the Korean people to hold genuine elections to produce a unified and democratic government, and establish a United Nations committee including representatives from China and the Soviet Union to ensure that the elections can be properly held."

　　抗议美帝侵略朝鲜
    伦敦举行群众大会
    决议要求和平解决朝鲜问题
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社伦敦六日讯：英国共产党伦敦区委员会为抗议美国侵略朝鲜而召开的群众大会，已于十月五日在伦敦中心区举行。“工人日报”副主笔高兰在会上发言。他指出：美国人要征服朝鲜全境，利用它做第三次世界大战的基地。他说：“朝鲜人要和平，但是他们决不接受美国坟山的和平。”
    高兰敦促大家发动劳工运动，起来要求停止朝鲜的战火，成立朝鲜统一的民主的共和国。高兰在谈到工党年会的外交辩论时指出，英国工党各地方组织有一半是反对工党政府的外交政策的。
    青年工程师利登，号召学习英国码头工人在一九二○年拒绝装运用于进攻苏俄的军火的榜样，制止对朝鲜的战争。
    英共伦敦区委书记马洪向大会说：英国人民被用作美国的工具，被驱使去参加犯罪的冒险，自己则失去一切。马洪号召大家支持将于十一月在英国举行的第二届世界拥护和平大会。
    群众大会通过决议说：“伦敦人的这个大会要求工党政府采取一切行动，把爱好和平的英国人民团结起来，制止又一次世界大战的危机。为了世界和平，我们声明，美国帝国主义对朝鲜人民的侵略必须予以制止，一切英军必须立刻回国。我们要求：政府应力求使战争获得和平解决，其办法就是立刻停战，一切外国军队一律撤退，让朝鲜人民举行真正的选举以产生统一的民主的政府，成立包括中苏两国代表在内的联合国委员会，以确保选举能够适当地举行。”
