The Shijiazhuang Cotton Yarn Cloth Company Values Cotton Farmers' Interests, Masters Market Prices, and Unites Private Merchants to Purchase New Cotton

[This Newspaper News] The Shijiazhuang Cotton Yarn Cloth Company values the interests of cotton farmers. Since new cotton came on the market in mid-August, it has actively started purchasing cotton. During the purchasing process, the company controlled appropriate prices, united legitimate cotton merchants, and prevented speculative activities by some merchants, exceeding the purchasing tasks for August and September (completing 292% of the tasks for August and September).

When the new cotton came on the market, the moisture content was about 13%. The purchasing cadres in the company were initially afraid that the scale loss would be too great, and also worried that the new cotton would become moldy, causing losses. This manifested as a reluctance to purchase, with some even afraid to purchase at all. The company promptly corrected this deviation, educating cadres to resolutely protect the interests of cotton farmers, actively purchase new cotton, and implement the policy of rewarding cotton planting; and gave specific instructions: If the moisture content is too high, the price can be specifically determined according to the moisture content; attention should be paid to spreading and drying after purchase; at the same time, the state's purchasing policy should be widely publicized to the masses, mobilizing the masses to dry cotton, and making the masses consciously pay attention to improving quality. This changed the cadres' reluctance to purchase.

In the purchasing process, cotton prices were adjusted at any time according to the moisture content. For example, at the beginning, the moisture content of seed cotton was 13%, and the price was 2,300 yuan per catty. Later, the moisture content was reduced to 10%, and it was adjusted to 2,650 yuan (at that time, the standard lint cotton was 7,900 yuan per catty). The company paid great attention to implementing the policy of taking into consideration both public and private interests, combining with some legitimate cotton merchants to purchase on behalf of the company, and providing them with great convenience. Cotton shops in various places applied to open for business one after another, with more than 300 households opening in Yuanshi County alone. When the new cotton had just come on the market, some private cotton merchants in remote areas had suppressed the price of seed cotton. In order to stabilize cotton prices and protect the interests of cotton farmers, the company immediately sent cadres to various markets to take control. In mid-to-late September, the company's funds were temporarily unable to meet the needs of the market, and peddlers once again went to remote areas to suppress the price of cotton. The company immediately used mobile funds to rush to the market to take control. If the peddlers purchased at the listed price, the company would not purchase or purchase less. If the peddlers suppressed the price, the company would purchase at the listed price. In this way, speculative activities of some private merchants were stopped twice, effectively protecting the interests of cotton farmers.

After mid-September, the amount of cotton on the market increased day by day. In order to prevent excessive release of cash and cause price fluctuations, the company adopted the method of exchanging cotton for real objects (cloth, grain) of equal value. The exchange volume of equal-value exchange accounted for more than one-third of the total cotton purchased, which played a certain role in reducing the amount of funds released and stabilizing prices.

In mid-to-late September, branches and some groups had deviations in controlling the grade price difference of seed cotton; good seed cotton should have been appropriately upgraded and priced higher, but generally it was not; as a result, the market price was higher than the listed price, the company could not buy good cotton, and the farmers were not satisfied. This deviation has been corrected in a timely manner.

The company is currently carrying out the following tasks: In order to avoid competing purchases and stabilize prices, it is studying the establishment of a raw cotton procurement committee with public and private cotton purchasing units; signing contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives for purchasing and ginning on their behalf; and combining with other specialized companies to organize joint purchase and sale operations to ensure planned purchase and supply of materials. In addition, the company is also studying the issue of regional differences and the rational difference between seed cotton and lint cotton.

　　石家庄花纱布公司重视棉农利益
    掌握牌价团结私商收购新棉
    【本报讯】石家庄花纱布公司重视棉农利益，自八月中旬新棉上市后，即开始积极收购棉花。在收购过程中，该公司掌握了适当的价格，团结了正当的棉商，并制止了部分商贩的投机活动，超额完成了八、九月份的收购任务（八、九月份完成任务百分之二百九十二）。
    新花登场时，潮分约达百分之十三。公司中的收花干部开始恐怕秤耗太大，又怕新花发霉，造成损失。在收购上表现了缩手缩脚的现象，有的甚至不敢收购。公司及时纠正了这种偏向，教育干部坚决保障棉农利益，积极收购新棉，贯彻奖励植棉政策；并具体指示：潮分过大可按潮分情形具体规定价格，收购后注意摊晒；同时应广泛向群众宣传国家收购政策，发动群众晒花，让群众自觉地注意提高质量。这样才转变了干部缩手缩脚的毛病。
    在收购过程中，根据潮分情况，随时调整了棉价。如开始籽棉潮分百分之十三，每斤价为二千三百元，后潮分缩减到百分之十，遂调整为二千六百五十元（当时标准皮棉每斤七千九百元）。该公司十分注意贯彻公私兼顾政策，结合一部分正当棉商为公司代购，并给予他们很大方便。各处花店纷纷申请开业，只元氏县开业的就有三百余户。新花刚上市时，部分偏僻地区的私营棉商，曾压价收购籽棉。公司为了稳定棉价，保障棉农利益，立即派出干部，赴各地市场掌握。九月中、下旬公司资金一时不能满足市场需要，小贩又一度到偏僻地区压价购棉。公司马上以机动资金分头赶集掌握，如小贩按牌价收购，公司即不收或少收，如小贩压价收购，公司即按牌价收购。这样两度制止了部分私商投机活动，切实保障了棉农利益。
    九月中旬以后，棉花上市量日益增多。公司为防止过多投放现款，引起物价波动，采取了以实物（布、粮）等价易棉办法。等价易棉的交换量约占总购棉量的三分之一以上，在缩减投放资金稳定物价上起了一定作用。   九月中下旬，支公司及某些小组在掌握籽棉等级差价上曾发生偏差；好籽棉原应适当提级提价，但一般均未提；结果造成市价高于牌价的现象，公司买不到好花，农民也不满意。这一偏差已及时纠正。
    该公司目前正进行以下几项工作：为了避免争购，稳定物价，正研究与公私购棉单位成立原棉采购委员会；与供销社订立代购代轧合同；并结合其它专业公司，组织购销联营，以保障有计划地收购与供应物资。此外，该公司并在研究地区间差额与籽、皮棉的合理差额问题。
