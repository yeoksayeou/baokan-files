　　Northeast Geological and Mineral Survey Team
    Achieves Major Success in Exploration
    In the past six months, in addition to surveying more than ten mining areas, they have discovered many rare mineral deposits and collected more than 30,000 specimens.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 25th] The Northeast Geological and Mineral Survey Team, the largest in China's history, has achieved great success in its field exploration work over the past six months. The team has successively surveyed more than ten mining areas of coal, iron, and non-ferrous metals from Southern Manchuria to Northern Manchuria, discovering many rare metal deposits and fossils of new genera and species. While climbing towering peaks, the team seized the time to draw more than 300 detailed geological maps and collect more than 30,000 specimens of various ores. The team's field exploration has now ended, and indoor research and identification work is underway, with a survey report to be submitted to the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government by the end of November.
    It is understood that the survey team is composed of experts from the Nanjing Geological Survey Institute's Mineral Survey and Exploration Department, the Beijing Geological Survey Institute, the Institute of Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Northeast Geological Survey Institute, among other organizations. The team leaders are Li Chunyu, Director of the Nanjing Geological Survey Institute, and Tong Cheng, Director of the Northeast Geological Survey Institute. Since the start of field exploration in early April, the team has worked without interruption, including Sundays, demonstrating a high degree of enthusiasm and responsibility for the country's economic construction.

    勘察工作获重大成就
    半年来除勘察十余矿区外，并发现不少稀有矿藏，采集标本三万余件。
    【新华社沈阳二十五日电】中国有史以来规模最大的东北地质矿产调查队，在过去半年中的野外勘察工作中，已获得很大成绩。该队先后勘察了从南满到北满的十余个煤铁与有色金属的矿区，发现许多稀有金属矿藏及新属种的化石。该队在攀登高入云霄的山峰中，抓紧时间绘制了详细的地质图三百余幅，采集了各种矿石标本三万余件。现该队的野外勘察已经结束，正展开室内研究鉴定工作，将于十一月末向东北人民政府工业部作出调查报告。
    按该调查队系由南京地质调查所矿产测勘处、北京地质调查所、中国科学院地球物理研究所、东北地质调查所等机关的专家合组而成。队长为南京地质调查所所长李春昱与东北地质调查所所长佟城。该队自四月初开始野外勘察后，包括星期日在内，从无一天间断工作，表现了对祖国经济建设事业的高度的热忱和责任心。
