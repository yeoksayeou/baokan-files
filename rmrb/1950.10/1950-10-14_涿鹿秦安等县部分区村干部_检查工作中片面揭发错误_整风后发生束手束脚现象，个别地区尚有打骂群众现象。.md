　　Zhuolu, Qin'an and Other Counties Partial District and Village Cadres
    One-Sidedly Exposed Errors During Inspection Work
    A Situation of Being Overly Cautious Appeared After the Rectification Campaign; Isolated Areas Still Experienced Incidents of Beating and Scolding the Masses.
    [Reported by this newspaper] A comprehensive report from correspondents: In a few areas of Chahar, Shaanxi, Gansu, Hunan, etc., due to the failure to analyze errors and the reasons for their occurrence during the rectification campaign, no corrective measures were determined. As a result, a few district and township cadres showed excessive caution in their work or continued to use coercion and commandism. After this rectification campaign (or preliminary rectification campaign), most cadres began to pay attention to correcting their commandist work style and learned to follow the mass line to implement policies. Their work reports to higher authorities were also more realistic than in the past. However, some other district and township cadres, because their commandism and the practice of doing everything for the people were criticized, but they did not learn to follow the mass line, showed a tendency of being overly cautious and not daring to take responsibility in their work. Some village cadres in Zhuolu County, Chahar, said, "I would rather be shot than lead the autumn cultivation." Some cadres in Yangyuan believed, "Removing coercion and commandism is equivalent to disarming me." Some township cadres in Qin'an County, Gansu, and Luochuan County, Shaanxi, held erroneous ideas such as "Rather not complete the task than commit commandism again" or "Not seeking merit, but seeking no fault" during summer grain collection and other work. In some villages in Zhuolu County, no one led the autumn cultivation at all; the same was true in Huailai. Some cadres in Qin'an even refused to deal with problems such as petty theft and fighting. Luochuan did not dare to correct some obvious errors in the summer grain collection. A more common concern among cadres was not knowing how to follow the mass line. Some sincerely asked others to tell them how to follow the mass line and how not to do everything for the people.
    Another phenomenon was that some people, although they examined and criticized commandism, did not truly recognize the harm and reasons for commandism. Therefore, they did not eliminate the erroneous idea that "it is impossible not to beat people in special circumstances" and "although people are beaten, the work is still successful." As a result, once they returned to actual work, the old habit of beating people reappeared. For example, Yi Dahui, a cadre in the Sixth District of Linxiang, Hunan, also made a self-criticism of his commandist work style during the rectification study. However, after returning to the village, someone reported to him that the chairman of the farmers' association was corrupt, so he convened a mass meeting to conduct a struggle session. When the chairman of the farmers' association defended himself, he started beating him again. After the rectification in that district, there were three other district cadres, Geng Jinping and others, who casually beat and kicked people. This phenomenon also existed in other areas.
    After discovering the above errors, the leading organs in various regions immediately paid attention to correcting them. Huailai overcame the spontaneous flow of work by strengthening specific leadership and organizational work. Linxiang County educated these cadres. Qin'an County decided to prevent and correct this tendency in the formal rectification campaign.

　　涿鹿秦安等县部分区村干部
    检查工作中片面揭发错误
    整风后发生束手束脚现象，个别地区尚有打骂群众现象。
    【本报讯】综合通讯员报道：察哈尔、陕西、甘肃、湖南等少数地区，由于在整风中未能分析错误及其产生的原因，致未定出纠正办法，因而有少数区乡干部在工作中表现了束手束脚，或是继续强迫命令。各地经过此次整风（或初步整风），大多数干部都开始注意了纠正自己的强迫命令作风，学走群众路线，以贯彻政策。在向上级做工作报告时，也较过去实在多了。但是，另有些区乡干部，由于自己的强迫命令、包办代替的作风，受到了批判，但又没有学会走群众路线，因此在工作中表现了束手束脚，不敢负责的偏向。察哈尔涿鹿县有的村干部说：“枪毙了我也不领导秋耕了”，阳原部分干部认为：“去掉了强迫命令，就等于解除了我的武装”，甘肃秦安县、陕西洛川县有些乡干部在夏征等工作中，抱着“宁叫任务完不成，也不要再犯命令主义”，或“不求有功，但求无过”等错误思想。涿鹿县有些村的秋耕，就根本没有人领导；怀来也是如此。秦安有些干部甚至连小偷、打架等问题也不予以处理。洛川对夏征中一些显然的错误也不敢加以纠正。干部中比较普遍的苦闷是不知道走群众路线，有的是诚恳地要求别人告诉他们怎样走群众路线，怎样不包办代替。
    另一种现象，有些人虽然检查和批判了强迫命令作风，但并未真正认识到强迫命令的危害及其原因，所以没有将“在特殊情况下不打人不行”和“虽然打人，但工作是有成绩的”错误思想肃清。因此一回到实际工作中去，打人的老毛病就又发作了。如湖南临湘六区干部易大圭，在整风学习时，对自己的强迫命令作风也做了检讨；但回村后，有人向他反映农协主席贪污，他便召开了群众大会进行斗争。当农协主席申辩时，他就又动手打开了。该区整风后随便打人踢人的，还有区干部耿金平等三人。其他地区也有此种现象。
    各地领导机关发现以上错误现象后，立即注意了纠正。怀来从加强具体领导和组织工作入手，克服了工作中的自流现象。临湘县对这些干部，进行了教育。秦安县决定在正式整风中，要防止与纠正此种倾向。
