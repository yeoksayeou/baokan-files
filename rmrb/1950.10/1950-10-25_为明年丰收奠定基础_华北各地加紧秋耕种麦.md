　　Laying the Foundation for Next Year's Bumper Harvest
    North China Intensifies Autumn Cultivation and Wheat Planting

    [Xinhua News Agency] A large-scale autumn cultivation campaign is underway in the North China region. In the northern part of Chahar Province, 40,000 head of livestock have been put to work, and 4 million mu of autumn land has been cultivated, accounting for over 50% of all autumn land. In the southern Chahar and Yanbei regions, about half of the autumn land has also been cultivated. In the plain-lake west region, 2.14 million mu of early stubble autumn land has been plowed one to two times. Provinces such as Suiyuan, Hebei, and Shanxi are also launching enthusiastic autumn cultivation campaigns under the slogans of "cultivate as you harvest" and "people, livestock, and farm tools never idle."

    Encouraged by the bumper harvest, autumn cultivation work in various regions began earlier than the autumn harvest. Preparations and adjustments were made in advance for the use of labor, livestock, and farm tools. In Longguan County, Chahar Province, 80% of women were mobilized to participate in harvesting and threshing, so that more than 900 head of livestock could be spared for autumn cultivation even during the busy autumn harvest. To overcome the difficulty of livestock power, various regions generally adopted the method of exchanging labor and livestock and signing contracts for cultivation and harrowing. For example, in Zhu Yanglou Village, Shan County, Pingyuan Province, after consultation, 40 households organized labor and livestock exchange contracts. All 23 head of livestock in the village were dispatched, and all the early stubble land was cultivated in four days. Due to the widespread development of labor and livestock exchange, cultivation techniques have been greatly improved, and the phenomena of shallow cultivation and rough harrowing have been greatly reduced.

    In terms of leadership in autumn cultivation, because most cadres have undergone rectification, they generally went deep into solving the specific difficulties of farmers during autumn cultivation. For example, in Xia Zhan Village, Wei County, Chahar Province, farmers were not enthusiastic about autumn cultivation. After investigation, it was found that 17 farmers had caused livestock owners to worry because they had not repaid labor for borrowing cattle last year or the exchange of labor was unreasonable. The working cadres of the district people's government immediately helped the households to make self-criticisms, and the labor households and livestock owners voluntarily agreed on a compensation method. The autumn cultivation campaign in the village was then launched enthusiastically. In addition, many places have further organized the equivalent exchange of labor and livestock from the clearing of old debts and wages, which has also greatly promoted autumn cultivation.

    [Xinhua News Agency, 19th] Various provinces in North China are intensifying wheat planting, and planting in the earlier sowing areas is nearing completion. Shanxi Province has now planted 16.5 million mu of wheat. In Pingyuan Province, land reserved for seeds (land that only grows one season of wheat a year) has already been planted, and some stubble land (land that grows wheat after the autumn harvest) has also completed sowing. Early sown wheat seedlings in counties such as Guanxian and Yanggu have emerged to a length of two fingers. Wheat sowing in Hebei Province has reached half of the planned amount. Some areas of Chahar and Suiyuan have also planted winter wheat.

    There has been a general lack of rain in North China after the autumn harvest. In order to complete the autumn sowing in a timely manner, the provincial people's governments have mobilized and led farmers to fight drought and rush to plant. The people's governments of three counties, including Bo'ai in Pingyuan Province, led farmers to use canals and wells to take turns irrigating the land day and night, and planted more than 200,000 mu of wheat fields in seven days. Farmers in the Yuncheng area of Shanxi Province, in addition to making use of all water sources and water tools to rush to irrigate, also adopted methods such as soaking seeds and planting seeds in dry soil, so that wheat fields throughout the area could be sown on time. In the flood-affected areas of Hebei Province, farmers are draining water to plant wheat. By the end of September, the disaster area of the province had released water from 13 million mu of flooded land (accounting for over 70% of the total area of flooded land), and all of it had been planted with wheat. The people's government has provided a large amount of wheat seed loans to help disaster victims plant wheat. The nine counties in the Tianjin area alone have loaned out more than 1.6 million catties of wheat seeds. Farmers in the disaster area have also launched a campaign to raise wheat seeds themselves by borrowing from each other, exchanging with each other, and engaging in contracting work and sideline production to solve the problem of seed shortages.

    A large number of improved wheat varieties have been promoted in this wheat planting in North China. Shanxi Province planted 42 million catties of improved varieties such as "Biyu Wheat", and Pingyuan Province planted a total of 15 million catties of more than 50 kinds of improved wheat varieties such as "Yulin Bai" and "438". The people's governments of Chahar and Suiyuan provinces promoted cold-resistant wheat varieties and expanded the area of winter wheat planting in the provinces. One mu of winter wheat can increase production by 20% to 30% compared to spring-sown wheat, and the quality is also better than spring wheat. During the sowing process, local people's governments also provided various agricultural medicines and dispatched technicians to the countryside to lead and help farmers carry out seed soaking and seed mixing work. About 60% of the wheat fields in Shanxi Province have been soaked, and most areas in Pingyuan Province have also conducted germination tests on wheat seeds before sowing. In addition, a campaign to cover green manure was generally carried out in North China this summer, and the people's government has recently issued a large number of fertilizer loans, so most wheat fields can get enough fertilizer. For example, in the old liberated areas of Shanxi, an average of 60 to 90 loads of base fertilizer are applied per mu, and the new areas also average 35 to 50 loads.

### 为明年丰收奠定基础  华北各地加紧秋耕种麦

　　为明年丰收奠定基础
    华北各地加紧秋耕种麦
    【新华社讯】华北区大规模的秋耕运动正在展开。察哈尔省察北地区已有四万犋牲畜上套，并已耕完秋地四百万亩，约占全部秋地的百分之五十以上。察南、雁北专区秋地亦耕及一半。平原湖西专区二百一十四万亩早槎秋地，已普耕一遍至二遍。绥远、河北、山西等省亦在“随收随耕”、“人、畜、农具三不闲”的口号下，掀起热烈的秋耕运动。
    由于丰收的鼓舞，各地秋耕工作均提前于秋收中开始。劳、畜力和农具的使用都预先做了准备和调剂。察哈尔龙关县发动了百分之八十的妇女参加收割、打场，故在紧张秋收中，仍能抽出九百余犋牲畜进行秋耕。对畜力的困难，各地普遍以人畜换工和订立包耕包耙合同的办法进行调剂，如平原单县朱杨楼村，经协议酝酿，组织起四十户人、畜换工合同，全村二十三犋牲畜全部出动，四天即耕完了全部早槎地。由于人、畜换工的普遍发展，使耕作技术大大改进，浅耕、粗耙的现象已大为减少。
    在秋耕领导上，由于干部大都经过整风，秋耕中一般均做到了深入解决农民具体困难。如察哈尔蔚县下战村，秋耕时农民情绪不高，经调查后发现有十七户农民因去年借牛不还工或换工不合理，致造成畜主顾虑。区人民政府工作干部当即帮助各户作了检讨，由劳力户和畜主自愿议定了补偿办法，该村秋耕运动遂即火热地开展起来。此外，还有不少地方从清理旧欠工资中，进一步组织劳畜力的等价换工，亦给秋耕以很大推动。
    【新华社十九日讯】华北各省正在加紧种麦，播种较早的地区已近结束。山西省现已种麦一千六百五十万亩。平原省留种地（一年只种一季麦的地）早已种完，部分赶茬地（收秋后再种麦的地）也已完成下种。冠县、阳谷等县早种麦苗已出土二指。河北全省麦田播种已达预定计划的半数。察哈尔、绥远部分地区也种了冬麦。
    华北各地秋收后普遍缺雨，各省人民政府为及时完成秋种，就发动和领导农民进行抗旱抢种。平原省博爱等三县人民政府，领导农民利用水渠、水井，昼夜不停地轮流浇地，七天内即播种二十余万亩麦田。山西运城专区农民除利用一切水源、水具突击浇种外，并采用浸种、干土寄种等办法，使全区麦田得以按时下种。在河北省的有水灾的地区，农民则进行排水种麦。九月底，该省灾区共脱出水淹地一千三百万亩（占淹地总面积的百分之七十强），全部种了麦子。人民政府为帮助灾民种麦，贷放了大批麦种。仅天津专区九个县即贷出麦种一百六十余万斤。灾区农民为解决种籽困难还以互借、互换，以及揽工、副业生产等方法，展开了自筹麦种的运动。
    华北在此次种麦中曾推广了大批优良麦种。山西播种了“碧玉麦”等良种四千二百万斤，平原省播种了“鱼鳞白”、“四三八”等五十多种优良麦种共一千五百万斤。察哈尔、绥远两省人民政府则推广抗寒麦种，在省内扩大了播种冬麦的地区。一亩冬麦可比春季播种的小麦增产百分之二十到三十，质量亦较春麦为好。在播种中，各地人民政府又贷放各种农用药剂，并派遣了技术人员下乡，领导和帮助农民进行浸种、拌种的工作。山西麦田约有百分之六十以上经过浸种，平原大部地区在播种前还进行过麦种的发芽试验。此外，今年夏天华北各地普遍开展过压绿肥的运动，再加上人民政府最近又发放了大批肥料贷款，因此大部麦田都能得到足够肥料。如山西老区平均每亩上底肥六十担到九十担，新区也平均达三十五担到五十担。
