　　Pravda New York Dispatch
    The Road to Peace
    Acheson is attempting to guide the General Assembly onto a path that has nothing in common with the tasks facing the United Nations, and the Soviet delegation is unwilling to follow this path.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 23rd] TASS, Moscow, September 23rd: Pravda published a New York dispatch on September 23rd by Lasadin and Filippov, entitled "The Road to Peace," in which they wrote: As in previous years, the Soviet delegation has come to the General Assembly with concrete plans to strengthen peace and cooperation among nations; the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, has already presented this plan in his speech.

    Following the speech by U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, the head of the Soviet delegation immediately took the floor. The two speeches by the foreign ministers of the United States and the Soviet Union reflected two plans, two tendencies in international policy. The Soviet delegation put forward a plan to eliminate the threat of a new war and to consolidate peace and the security of all nations; the U.S. delegation put forward a plan to destroy the United Nations as an instrument of peace, to further expand aggression, and to launch a new war.

    Lasadin and Filippov further wrote: In contrast to the solemn and calm tone of the Soviet Foreign Minister's speech, even the American newspapers admitted that Acheson's speech was the most激烈的of all the speeches delivered by his predecessors at the United Nations.

    The U.S. Secretary of State's speech was filled with slanderous sentences and hypocritical assurances: insisting that the United States stands for "freedom," for consolidating "brotherly ties" between nations, and for striving for a "just peace." Acheson reiterated his oath of allegiance to the United Nations. But neither lawyers' speeches nor smoky lies and crude slanders against the Soviet Union can hide his true situation from the people of the world. The American bombs and bullets that are creating death and destruction in Korea are far more convincing than any words. The U.S. ruling clique has launched an imperialist aggression against the Korean people, which has already stained themselves with the eternal infamy of aggressors, enemies of the peace, freedom, and independence of all nations.

    The whole world is very clear: American diplomats use hypocritical love for peace to cover up frenzied war preparations, which have been proven by the unprecedented increase in U.S. military spending.

    Lasadin and Filippov continued: It is therefore no wonder that the U.S. delegation has proposed at the General Assembly suggestions that deepen international tension, destroy the United Nations, and transform the United Nations into a cloak for U.S. aggressive policy.

    In particular, the U.S. ruling clique intends to destroy the Security Council—the main body of the United Nations, which was established to ensure and maintain international peace on the basis of the cooperation and unity of the five great powers—the permanent members of the Security Council.

    To paralyze the Security Council and use the United Nations General Assembly as a tool for stamping resolutions desired by the U.S. State Department—this is the essence of Acheson's proposal. The U.S. delegation also put forward a proposal, according to which each member state must designate armed forces, which must be specially trained and armed, ready to rapidly engage in war for the United Nations.

    The events in Korea have vividly demonstrated that the U.S. ruling clique is striving to create an alliance of imperialist colonial countries under the banner of the United Nations to suppress the national liberation movements of all nations.

    Acheson is trying to turn the United Nations into a gendarmerie, so that it can be used under Washington's orders to achieve aggressive aims. It is clear that this U.S. policy has nothing in common with ensuring international security or the principles, goals, and tasks of the United Nations.

    In order to achieve the same aggressive aims, Acheson suggested establishing so-called "security patrol teams" to ensure, as he said, "immediate independent observation and reporting in any area where international conflict is likely to break out."

    Hidden under the hypocritical signboard of "security patrol teams" is the old trick of the war-monger Dulles. This kind of pro-American "patrol team" already exists under the guise of the so-called United Nations Special Committee on the Balkans and the Korean Committee. It was this Special Committee on the Balkans, formed by the United Nations under U.S. coercion, that fabricated slanderous reports and telegrams describing the border situation between Greece and its neighbors in order to justify the armed intervention of the Anglo-American aggressors in the internal affairs of the Greek people. In Korea, there is now another similar committee following behind the American aggressors, and its task is to sign reports and telegrams written by General MacArthur's headquarters.

    In analyzing Acheson's speech, the head of the Soviet delegation said: Acheson is attempting to guide the General Assembly onto a path that has nothing in common with the tasks facing the United Nations. And these tasks must be resolved in accordance with the interests of all peace-loving nations, in accordance with the interests of all progressive humanity.

    Vyshinsky also said: The Soviet delegation is unwilling to follow this path, which has nothing in common with the road to peace.

    Lasadin and Filippov concluded: The Soviet delegation is fighting to ensure that the United Nations faithfully fulfills its task as an instrument of peace and international cooperation. The Soviet delegation is waging an unwavering, noble struggle for the interests of all peace-loving people, for international peace and friendship.

    到和平之路
    艾奇逊企图将联大导引到与联合国面前的任务毫无共同之处的道路上，苏联代表团决不愿意遵循这条道路。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科九月二十三日电：真理报九月二十三日刊出拉萨丁与费利波夫的纽约通讯，题为《到和平之路》，他们写道：如同在以前的几年中一样，苏联代表团带着加强和平与各国人民间的合作的具体计划前来参加联大会议；苏联代表团团长维辛斯基已在演说中提出了这一计划。
    在美国国务卿艾奇逊演说后，苏联代表团团长立即上台发言。美国与苏联两国外交部长的两篇演说反映了两种计划，两种国际政策的倾向。苏联代表团提出了消除新战争威胁和巩固和平与各国安全的计划；美国代表团则提出了毁灭作为和平工具的联合国的计划，进一步扩大侵略和发动新战争的计划。
    拉萨丁与费利波夫进一步写道：在苏联外交部长演说的严正而平心静气的语气对照之下，即使美国报纸也承认艾奇逊的演说是他的前辈们在联合国所发表的所有演说中最激烈的。
    美国国务卿的演说中充满着诽谤的句子和虚伪的保证：硬说美国主张“自由”，主张巩固各国间“兄弟般的联系”的，并且为“正义的和平”而奋斗。艾奇逊重申其忠于联合国的誓言。但是不管是律师们的演说或是乌烟障气的谎言以及粗制滥造诽谤苏联的谰言，是无法使艾奇逊在世界各国人民的面前隐瞒其真情实况。在朝鲜制造死亡和毁灭的美国炸弹和枪弹，远比任何话语更有说服力。美国统治集团对朝鲜人民发动了帝国主义的侵略，已经使他们自己蒙上侵略者各国人民的和平、自由与独立之敌的永世臭名。
    全世界都非常清楚：美国外交官用对和平的虚伪的热爱来掩饰狂热的战争准备，这种狂热的备战已由美国空前未有的增加军费得到了证明。
    拉萨丁与费利波夫继续写道：因此无怪乎美国代表团在大会上提出了加深国际的紧张局势、毁灭联合国、以及变联合国为美国侵略政策的外衣的建议。
    尤其是美国统治集团意图摧毁安理会——联合国的主要机构，这个机构的建立是为了在五大强国——安理会的常任理事国——的合作与一致的基础上，保证并且维持国际和平。
    瘫痪安理会并利用联合国大会作为美国国务院所希望的决议上加盖图章的工具，这便是艾奇逊建议的实质。美国代表团并提出一项建议，依照这个建议，每一会员国必须指派武装部队，这些武装部队要有特别训练和武装，随时准备为联合国迅速参战。
    朝鲜的事件已生动地证明美国统治集团力图在联合国的旗帜下创设一种帝国主义殖民国家的同盟，来镇压各国人民的民族解放运动。
    艾奇逊力图把联合国变为宪兵，以便在华盛顿的命令下利用它来达到侵略目的。很清楚地，美国这种政策与保证国际安全或联合国的原则、目标及任务毫无相同之处。
    为了要达到同样的侵略目的，艾奇逊建议设立所谓“安全巡察队”，以便保证，像他所说的一样，“在国际冲突有爆发之势的任何地区，立刻进行独立的观察和提出报告”。
    在“安全巡察队”的虚伪招牌下，隐藏着战争贩子杜勒斯的老诡计。这一类亲美的“巡察队”已经穿着所谓联合国巴尔干特别委员会及朝鲜委员会的外衣而存在了。为了为美英侵略者武装干涉希腊人民内政的行动辩解，而不惜杜撰诽谤性的报告及电报描写希腊及其邻邦间的边疆情势的，正是这个由美国强迫联合国组成的巴尔干特别委员会。在朝鲜，现在还有另一个类似的委员会跟在美国侵略者屁股后面，它的任务是在麦克阿瑟将军总部所写出的报告及电报上签字。
    苏联代表团团长在分析艾奇逊的演说时说：艾奇逊企图将联大导引到与联合国面前的任务毫无共同之处的道路上。而这些任务是必须要根据一切爱好和平的民族的利益，根据所有进步人类的利益来加以解决的。
    维辛斯基又说：苏联代表团决不愿意遵循这一条与和平之路毫无共同之处的道路。
    拉萨丁与费利波夫结语称：苏联代表团正为争取联合国忠实履行其和平及国际合作的工具之任务而斗争。苏联代表团正为一切爱好和平人民的利益，为争取国际和平及友谊，进行着始终不渝的、高尚的斗争。
