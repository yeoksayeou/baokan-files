　　Under the Rule of American and Japanese Reactionaries
    The Japanese People's Suffering Deepens
    Unemployed Workers are Forced to Commit Suicide, Slave Trade is Rampant
    [Xinhua News Agency, New York, 29th] According to TASS, New York, 26th: Reports of the unfortunate situation of the Japanese masses are becoming increasingly common in newspapers. American imperialists and their Japanese servants are attempting to turn Japan into a colonial country.
    The American newspaper *Newsday* recently published a dispatch from Tokyo stating: Due to massive unemployment, millions of Japanese are doomed to starve. Horrible poverty and the lack of hope to improve their situation are forcing them to commit suicide. The newspaper pointed out that according to official materials from the National Local Police Headquarters, twenty people commit suicide every day in Japan.
    *Newsday* described many incidents of people committing suicide out of despair due to hunger and poverty. The newspaper said: One Japanese man, who had been unable to find work since last autumn, drowned his wife and children and then committed suicide. In another incident, a couple and their eight children committed suicide as a family because they could not make a living.
    Unemployment and poverty have led to the revival of the shameful slave system in Japan. Recently, hundreds of children have been sold into slavery in Yamagata, Iwate, Kanagawa, Saitama and other prefectures. A forty-two-year-old woman, unable to find work and make a living, sold herself and her two children into slavery.
    The trade in slaves has developed to such a large scale in Japan that many traffickers have emerged who specialize in "buying and selling slaves." Newspaper reports state that concrete investigations have confirmed that there are more than twenty traffickers engaged in trading children in the Tohoku region of Japan. The Japanese newspaper *Mainichi Shimbun* described the crimes of a group of child traffickers in Osaka and Nagoya, who sold hundreds of girls who could not make a living to brothels. According to materials from the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare, there are 129,000 homeless children in Japan. And the actual number is much larger than this.

　　在美日反动派统治下
    日本人民苦难日深
    失业工人被迫自杀、奴隶买卖盛行
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十六日讯：报道日本群众处境不幸的消息，在报纸上愈来愈常见了。美帝国主义者和他们的日本仆从，正企图变日本为殖民地国家。
    美国的新闻日报最近刊载东京通讯说：由于大批的失业，千百万名日本人注定了要挨饿。可怖的贫穷和毫无改善他们处境的希望，迫使着他们自杀。该报指明：据国家地方警察本部的官方材料，日本每天都有二十人自杀。
    新闻日报描述了许多人民因饥饿和贫穷感到生活无望而自杀的事件。该报说：有一个日本人，自从去年秋天就一直没有找到工作，他把他的妻子和孩子溺死，然后自杀。另一事件，夫妇二人及八个孩子，因无法谋生而全家自杀。
    失业和穷困使得可耻的奴隶制度，又在日本复活了。近来，成百的孩子们在山形、岩手、神奈川、琦玉等县被卖为奴隶。有一位四十二岁的妇女在没有希望找到工作而无法谋生的时候，便把自己和她的两个孩子一起出卖给别人当奴隶。
    买卖奴隶已在日本发展到了这样大的规模，以致日本涌现出许多以“买卖奴隶”为业的贩子。报纸消息说：具体的调查证实，日本东北地方从事买卖儿童的贩子有二十多个。日本报纸每日新闻描述了大阪和名古屋一群贩卖儿童的人的罪行，他们把数百个无法谋生的女孩子卖给妓院。据日本厚生省的材料，日本有十二万九千个孩子无家可归。而实际数字要比这大得多。
