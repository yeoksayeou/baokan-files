　　Jiudaohang of Kailuan Tangshan Mine:
    21 Months Without Casualties
    [Our Newspaper] In the twenty-one months since liberation, Jiudaohang of Kailuan Coal Mine in Tangshan has never had a casualty accident, ensuring the smooth progress of production. More than 2,600 workers work in Jiudaohang. In the early days of liberation, the staff had the idea that "going down the well is three points dangerous, and people will inevitably die underground." In response to this situation, the trade union carried out ideological education of safety first among the workers, especially among the production management personnel.
    In the beginning, many employees, especially production management personnel, lacked confidence. Their opinion was: to be safe, we must reduce production. If they were held accountable for accidents, they would resist by "going to court." In order to resolve these concerns, the trade union led everyone to study the experiences of the workers being injured. The results of the study proved that casualties were caused by violating coal mining specifications, or the project being not strong, or negligence, or management personnel abandoning their management responsibilities. The trade union also guided everyone to analyze the losses and impacts caused by casualties, as well as improvement methods. Everyone began to realize that accidents could be avoided.
    Recognizing that production and safety are not contradictory, from then on, Jiudaohang must first consider safety equipment before each project is carried out. Trade union cadres patiently explained to production management personnel that safety is one of the main tasks of production management, and production cannot be done well without safety equipment. Trade union cadres also used past facts to carefully calculate the costs with them: the death or injury of a worker is a loss to the country. At the same time, workers at the accident site will take a long time to feel at ease to produce, and as a result, production will suffer a great loss. This method corrected the one-sided thinking of the cadres. Then, workers were called upon to pay attention to checking safety equipment and proposing methods for improving safety equipment. At first, some workers took cigarettes down the well. The trade union used the fact that workers were killed by fire caused by smoking in the past to educate them. After listening, the workers said, "Smoking is more dangerous than throwing bombs." As a result, the phenomenon of smoking was eliminated. Management personnel also paid attention to engineering specifications. With everyone's concerted efforts, the achievement of Jiudaohang, with more than 2,600 workers, having no casualties for twenty-one months was created. (Yang Jun)

　　开滦唐山矿九道行
    廿一月未出伤亡事故
    【本报讯】开滦煤矿唐山矿九道行在解放后的二十一个月中，从未发生伤亡事故，保证了生产的顺利进行。在九道行工作的工人共两千六百多名。在解放初期，工作人员都有“下井三分险，井下不能不死人”的思想。工会针对这种情况，在工友中，尤其是在生产管理人员中，开展了安全第一的思想教育。
    起初，很多职工，尤其是生产管理人员的信心不足，他们的意见是：要安全就得少生产。如果追查事故责任，他们就以“上法院”来对抗。为了解决这些顾虑，工会即领导大家研究工友们受伤的经过，研究结果乃证明：伤亡事故都是因为违犯了采煤规格，或工程不坚固，或疏忽大意和管理人员放弃管理职责所造成。工会又引导大家分析伤亡事故所造成的损失和影响，以及改进办法。大家开始认识事故是可以避免的。
    认识了生产和安全并不是对立的，从此，九道行每一工程进行前首先要考虑安全设备。工会干部耐心地向生产管理人员解释安全是生产管理上主要工作之一，没有安全设备的地方就不能搞好生产。工会干部并用过去的事实和他们算细账：死伤一个工友是国家的损失，同时，出事地点的工友要过很久才能安心生产，结果，使生产要受到很大损失。用这种方法纠正了干部的片面思想，接着，号召工友们注意检查安全设备和提出改进安全设备的办法。开初，有的工友带着烟下井，工会用过去本矿因吸烟起火而炸死工友的事实作教育，工友听了后说：“吸烟比扔炸弹还厉害。”于是吸烟现象杜绝了。管理人员也注意了工程规格。在大家一致努力下，创造了两千六百多工人的九道行二十一个月无伤亡事故的成绩。（杨俊）
