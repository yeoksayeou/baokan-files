In Rectification Study and Work Inspection, It Was Discovered That Some Cadres Have Complacent and Meritorious Sentiments

[Reported by this newspaper] In the rectification study and work inspection, various places have discovered that some cadres have very serious complacent and self-satisfied sentiments, which hinder the advancement of work and their own progress. This sentiment is mainly manifested in the fact that some older cadres are greedy for enjoyment, care about personal fame and gain, flaunt their seniority, and even disregard the organization, violate laws and discipline, and act recklessly. According to the three-month work inspection by the Discipline Inspection Committee of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, among the fifty cases of county and regimental-level cadres violating discipline that were handled, ten cases involving twenty people belonged to the category of greed, corruption, and hedonistic thinking. The Beijing Municipal Committee inspected the phenomena of cadres violating discipline since entering the city a year ago and found eighty-eight people involved in corruption. In some areas of the Southwest and Northwest, it was discovered that some cadres consider themselves victors and treat non-Party democratic figures and newly joined staff with arrogance. Instead of adopting a sincere attitude to unite and cooperate with non-Party figures and new cadres, they discriminate against and are jealous of them. Some say, "We conquered the world," and therefore act arrogantly; others complain, "We are destined to suffer, while others are destined to enjoy happiness." "When we have problems, they call it party rectification, but others who have no merit become high-ranking officials." This demonstrates a serious narrow-minded closed-doorism tendency. In some areas (Chongqing), some cadres, because they consider themselves meritorious, have a strong sense of position and are not at ease with office work. For example, a cadre in a certain bureau was promoted two levels by the higher authorities but was still full of complaints. Some cadres even refuse to implement instructions from superiors and even form their own systems and enact their own laws. For example, Wei Guangbo, the county magistrate of Weinan County in the Northwest, privately ordered all districts in the county to stop paying rent and interest and set his own tax rates for collection. Zhao Bingyan, the secretary of the Yueyang County Committee in Hunan Province, did not study or research the resolutions and instructions of the higher-level Party committee, adopting a perfunctory attitude; he did not actively try to implement the work assigned by the higher authorities, but believed that completing seven or eight out of ten tasks would be good enough. Therefore, the perfect and correct execution of the policies of the People's Government and the Party in the county was greatly affected. Some cadres also believed that they had contributed to the revolution and should have special privileges, using family difficulties as an excuse to delay paying public grain or using their positions to privately occupy the land of the masses. For example, Li Jisheng, the secretary of the Meng County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Shanxi, had been in arrears with public grain for three years. After being discovered by the higher authorities, he examined his personal selfish and privileged thinking and paid the 1,112 jin of public grain owed by his family; the secretary and magistrate of Fanshi County originally had a share of land in their hometowns, but they also took another share of land in the county and even asked the masses to cultivate it for them. Liu Zixin, the secretary of the Fourth District Committee of Shouzhang County in Pingyuan Province, seriously harbored the Kuomintang's privileged rule ideology, standing above the people and acting arbitrarily, even to the point of illegally forcing marriages and committing criminal acts. Li Zongwen, a district cadre in Lili District, Wujiang County, Southern Jiangsu, even scolded and beat the masses at a mass meeting convened by the People's Government under the pretext that "the masses are not holding the meeting properly," and even fired shots at the masses, injuring them. Although the above examples are just individual phenomena, and most of them have been given appropriate handling by their direct superiors, they illustrate that the sentiment of pride and complacency is seriously present in the minds of some cadres. The main reason is the impurity of the cadres' character; on the other hand, because our Party has been in a tense and frequent combat environment for a long time and quickly entered a period of peaceful construction, the Party's education work has lacked systematic implementation. Therefore, some cadres' bad thoughts and styles have not had time to overcome and correct, and some have arisen and grown in the new environment. The leading organs in various places are paying attention to correcting these bad thoughts and styles. Some areas (such as the Southwest Region) have already achieved preliminary results, which has aroused the vigilance of some cadres, but it is still necessary to conduct a thorough review from the cadres' thinking and the social and historical roots.

Currently, some cadres in the rectification still hold an arrogant attitude and are unwilling to deeply and humbly examine themselves. For example, some Party member cadres in the Health Department of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government said, "We are all 'March 8th' Party members" (referring to those who joined the Party around 1938), flaunting their seniority and thinking that there is nothing to rectify. Zhejiang and Hubei provinces have also discovered that some Party member cadres are not humble in learning good experiences from others in the rectification, are satisfied with their old ways, are not convinced by the work that others have done well, and when superiors criticize their shortcomings, they use various methods to cover up and resist criticism. In addition to thoroughly reflecting on and correcting their mistakes in the rectification, we should strengthen ideological leadership for these proud, complacent, and unprogressive Party member cadres and further improve them in terms of cultural and political level. Only in this way can we overcome the above-mentioned cadres' erroneous thinking of pride and complacency.

　　整风学习和工作检查中发现
    部分干部有骄傲居功情绪
    【本报讯】在整风学习和工作检查中，各地都发现有一部分干部以功臣自居的骄傲自满情绪十分严重，障碍着工作的推进和他们本身的进步。这种情绪主要表现在有一些较老的干部，贪图享受、计较个人名利地位、摆老资格，甚至目无组织，违法犯纪，胡作非为。据中共中央华北局纪律检查委员会三个月的工作检查，在处理县团级以上干部违犯纪律的五十个案件中，属于贪污腐化享乐思想者即有十件共二十人。北京市委检查了干部自入城一年来违犯纪律的现象，检查出贪污腐化者八十八人。西南、西北等地部分地区发现有部分干部以胜利者自居，对待党外民主人士和新参加工作的人员，态度傲慢。他们不是抱着诚恳的态度去与党外人士和新干部团结合作，而是歧视与嫉妒他们。有的说：“天下是我们打下来的”，因此盛气凌人；有的埋怨“我们注定吃苦，人家注定享福”。“我们有毛病就叫整党，人家无功反做大官”。表现了严重的狭隘关门主义倾向。有的地区（重庆市）部分干部由于以功臣自居，地位观念很重，不安心于机关工作。如某局的一个干部被上级一直提拔了两级，还是牢骚满腹。还有的干部对上级的指示抗不执行，甚至自成系统，另立法令。如西北渭南县县长魏光波私自下令全县各区停止交租交息，自定税率进行征税。湖南省岳阳县委书记赵冰岩，对上级党的决议、指示，不学习、不研究，抱马马虎虎的态度；对上级布置的工作，不积极想法去实现，却认为能完成十之七八就算不错，因此，大大影响了人民政府和党的政策不能在该县完满与正确的执行。还有的干部自以为对革命有功，要有特权，借口家庭困难拖缴公粮或利用工作职位，私自占用群众的土地。如中共山西盂县县委书记李计生家中拖欠公粮三年之久，经上级检查发现后才检讨了个人自私自利的特权思想，把家中拖欠的一千一百一十二斤公粮缴了出来；繁峙县委书记和县长本来在老家分了一份土地，却又在该县另分了一份土地，还要群众代耕。平原省寿张县四区区委书记刘子新严重地存在着国民党的特权统治思想，站在人民头上，作威作福，竟至于非法逼婚造成了犯法行为。苏南吴江县黎里区区干部李宗文竟在人民政府召开的群众大会上借口“群众不好好开会”，打骂群众，甚至向群众鸣枪射击，致击伤了群众。以上这些例子，虽然是一些个别现象，且多已由其直属上级给以适当的处理，但这些说明了目前在一部分干部思想中骄傲居功情绪是严重存在的。其原因：主要的是由于干部品质的不纯；另一方面是因为我党长时期处在紧张频繁的战斗环境，很快进入到和平建设时期，党的教育工作缺乏系统地进行。因此某些干部不良的思想和作风有的还没有来得及克服纠正，有的却在新的环境下产生和滋长起来。对于这些不良的思想和作风，各地领导机关正注意加以纠正。且有的地区（如西南区）已有初步收获，引起了一些干部的警惕，但还须从干部思想上，社会历史根源上作深刻的检讨。
    目前在整风中仍有部分干部抱着傲慢态度，不肯深刻地虚心地去检讨自己。如广东省人民政府卫生厅的部分党员干部说：“我们都是三八式党员”（这是指的在一九三八年左右参加了党的），摆老资格，认为没有什么风可整。浙江、湖北两省也发现有的党员干部在整风中不虚心向别人学习好的经验，满足于自己的老一套，自己做不好而别人做好了的工作自己又不服气，当上级批评到他们的缺点时，就用各种各样的方式掩护自己，抵制批评。对这种骄傲自满，不求进步的党员干部，除应在整风中使其彻底反省改正错误外，另方面应加强对他们的思想领导，进一步从文化、政治水平等方面去提高他们，也只有这样，才能克服上述这些干部的骄傲居功的错误思想。
