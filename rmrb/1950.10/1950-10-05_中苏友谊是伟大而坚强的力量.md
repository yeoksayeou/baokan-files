　　Sino-Soviet Friendship is a Great and Strong Force
    Professor Andrei Ginisov, Chairman of the Council of the Soviet Union for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries
    The friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union is a great force in the struggle to consolidate world peace. Throughout human history, there has never been a force comparable to the powerful force of Sino-Soviet friendship.
    The friendship between our two great nations was born as early as the days of the historically significant October Revolution of 1917. At that time, the working people of Russia, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party headed by Lenin and Stalin, founded the world's first Soviet Socialist Republic—a socialist state of workers and peasants. The Soviet revolution opened a new era in the lives of all nations. This revolution liberated the peoples of the former Russian Empire, establishing national equality and national autonomy. In the process of its victory, the Soviet revolution established the friendship of all ethnic groups within the system of the unified multi-ethnic state of the Soviet Union. The Soviet revolution proclaimed the birth of new, advanced, and truly democratic principles of cooperation between all nations.
    Chinese patriots have always recognized that friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union are an inexhaustible source for freedom, independence, and the creative power of world peace. Sun Yat-sen expressed the hope that the day would quickly come when the Soviet Union would welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally, and that the two countries would join hands in the great battle for the freedom of the oppressed peoples of the world to achieve victory. That day has arrived.
    The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance signed in February 1950 opened a new and splendid page in the development of relations between the two great peoples.
    The Soviet people, educated in the spirit of loyalty to proletarian internationalism, have always fully understood and deeply sympathized with the heroic struggle of the Chinese people and their glorious Communist Party. The aim of this struggle is to achieve national independence and to transform domestic life for the benefit of the working people. The Soviet people welcomed the birth of the People's Republic of China with boundless joy. The birth of the People's Republic of China signifies the realization of the ideals of millions of honest and progressive Chinese people.
    The Chinese people have spent a year of tenacious labor under the banner of the People's Republic of China. What are the results? The results are great achievements in all areas of economic, political, and cultural life. The main achievement is the establishment of a solid political foundation on which the Chinese people are building the great edifice of a free China, a warm, bright, and spacious home for the happy life of the masses. It is also worth noting that millions of Chinese people, men and women, young and old, regardless of ethnicity, are striving for knowledge and culture. The significant and growing awareness of the working people is a clear indicator of the victory of China's new state system and evidence of its continuous consolidation.
    The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, established a year ago, plays a significant role in consolidating the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. The ranks of this organization are growing rapidly. It is doing important work in introducing the achievements of the Soviet Union to the working people of China, in introducing the Soviet social system and advanced culture, and in exposing the fabrications and slanderous inventions made by imperialists and their agents against the Soviet Union. It actively promotes the development of cultural ties between our two great nations. The smooth development of cultural ties can be seen in many examples.
    Three delegations have visited China in the past year, namely, the Soviet delegation of cultural, artistic, and scientific workers, the Soviet women's delegation, and the Soviet youth delegation. In addition, several Soviet scholars have visited China. On the other hand, at the invitation of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and other Soviet social organizations, delegations have come to observe Soviet life, including the Chinese cultural workers' delegation headed by writer Guo Moruo, the Chinese trade union delegation headed by Liu Ningyi, the youth delegation headed by Xiao Hua, the delegation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and individual cultural workers (such as writer Xiao San, etc.). Undoubtedly, the mutual visits of delegations from both countries have promoted the cause of friendship and cultural cooperation between our two peoples.
    Moscow published many works by Chinese writers in 1949 and 1950. It systematically holds exhibitions introducing Chinese culture, especially Chinese art exhibitions.
    October 5th is the anniversary of the founding of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. I respectfully wish the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and through it, I wish the Chinese people new and greater achievements in building their country and their culture, and in the struggle for world peace.
    May the friendship between the great Soviet people and the great Chinese people be consolidated and last forever!

　　中苏友谊是伟大而坚强的力量
    苏联对外文化联络协会理事会主席  安德烈·吉尼索夫教授
    中苏两国人民的友谊是巩固全世界和平斗争中的伟大力量。在人类历史上，过去和现在都没有能与中苏友谊这一强大力量相比拟的力量。
    我们两个伟大民族的友谊，早在有历史意义的一九一七年十月革命的日子里便产生了。那时，俄国劳动人民在以列宁、斯大林为首的布尔什维克党领导下，在世界上创立了第一个苏维埃社会主义共和国——工农社会主义国家。苏联革命开辟了各民族生活中的新纪元。这个革命解放了以前俄罗斯帝国的各族人民，确立了民族平等和民族自主。苏联革命在其胜利的进程中将各族人民的友谊建立在苏联这一个统一的多民族国家的体系中。苏联革命宣告了各国人民间新的、先进的、真正民主的合作原则之诞生。
    中国的爱国志士一向就认定同苏联友好和联盟，就是服务于自由、独立与全世界和平的创造力的无尽源泉。孙中山当时曾表示希望那样的一天迅速来到，那时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立的中国，并且两国在争取世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进以取得胜利。而这样的一天已经来到了。
    一九五○年二月所签订的中苏友好同盟互助条约，在两国伟大人民关系的发展中，揭开了新的灿烂的一页。
    以忠于无产阶级国际主义精神教育出来的苏维埃人们，对于中国人民及其光荣的共产党的英勇斗争，一向是充分理解和深刻同情的。这一斗争的目的，乃是争取民族独立，并为劳动人民的利益而改造国内的生活。苏联人民曾以无限的喜悦欢迎中华人民共和国的诞生，中华人民共和国的诞生意味着中国千百万诚实和先进的人们的理想实现了。
    中国人民在中华人民共和国旗帜下度过了倔强坚韧的劳动的一年。结果是怎样呢？结果在经济、政治和文化生活各个领域内都获得了伟大的成就。而主要的，则是建立了坚固的政治基础，在这一基础上，中国人民正为人民大众的快乐生活而建设着自由中国的温暖、光明而宽敞的伟大建筑。还有值得注意的是千百万中国人，不论男女老少，不分民族，都在努力追求着知识和文化。劳动人民的显著增长着的觉悟，乃是中国新的国家制度胜利的明显指标之一，同时也是这一制度不断巩固的明证。
    一年以前成立的中苏友好协会总会，在巩固中苏两国人民的友谊中起着重大的作用。这一组织的行列正在迅速地增长着，它在介绍中国劳动人民认识苏联的成就、认识苏联社会制度和先进文化上，作着重要的工作，并揭露帝国主义者及其代理人对苏联所作的捏造的和诽谤性的谰言虚构。它积极地促进我们两大民族间文化连系的发展。而文化连系的顺利发展，可以从许多例子上看出来。
    一年中有三个代表团到过中国，即苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团，苏联妇女代表团以及苏联青年代表团。此外，还有好几个苏联学者曾经访问中国。而在另一方面，应苏联对外文化联络协会以及其他苏联社会团体邀请而来观察苏联生活的，则有以作家郭沫若为首的中国文化工作者代表团，以刘宁一为首的中国工会代表团，以萧华为首的青年代表团，中华人民共和国科学院代表团，以及个别的文化工作者（如作家萧三等等）。毫无疑义，两国代表团的互相往还促进了我们两国人民友好和文化合作的事业。
    莫斯科在一九四九年到一九五○年中曾出版了许多中国著作家的作品。并且有系统地举办介绍中国文化的展览会，特别是中国艺术展览会。
    十月五日是中苏友好协会总会成立周年纪念的一天，我敬祝中苏友好协会，并通过它敬祝中国人民在建设自己的国家和自己的文化中，以及争取全世界和平的斗争中，获得新的和更大的成就。
    祝伟大的苏联人民和伟大的中国人民之间的友谊巩固并永垂不朽！
          （莫斯科特稿）
