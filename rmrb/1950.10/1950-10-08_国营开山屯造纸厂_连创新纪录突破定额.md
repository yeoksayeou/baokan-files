　　State-owned Kai Shan Tun Paper Mill
    Continuously Sets New Records, Exceeds Quotas
    [This Newspaper, Jilin News] The state-owned Kai Shan Tun Paper Mill, which has been in operation for just over two months, has continuously set new production records. The daily output of sulfite pulp at the mill has increased to 66 tons and 70 kilograms, exceeding the production quota (51 tons and 600 kilograms) by more than 15 tons, breaking the "standard output" of 60 tons of pulp per day during the Japanese puppet regime (during the puppet Manchurian era, the maximum efficiency of the machines was 60 tons per day, but actual production did not reach this number). The paper machines in the paper-making workshop created a new record of 33 and a half hours without interruption. On September 20, the cooking team created a new record for the shortest cooking time in the Northeast paper industry, reducing the cooking time for one batch of pulp to 11 hours and 3 minutes, with an output of 17.5 tons per batch, and the products were all top-quality and first-class. The main reasons for the mill's continuous new records are that all the employees have brought into play their enthusiasm and creativity, and improved their technology; at the same time, various advanced scientific systems have been gradually established, such as the responsibility system and the shift handover system, and the implementation of operating according to technical procedures and close cooperation between the workshops has been strictly enforced.

　　国营开山屯造纸厂
    连创新纪录突破定额
    【本报吉林讯】开工仅两个多月的国营开山屯造纸厂，连续创造了生产新纪录。该厂亚硫酸纸浆日产量已提高到六十六吨零七十公斤，超过生产定额（五十一吨零六百公斤）十五吨多，打破了伪满日产六十吨纸浆的“标准产量”（伪满时代机器最高效能为日产六十吨，实际生产达不到此数）。抄浆车间抄纸机创造了三十三小时半不断头的新纪录。蒸煮班于九月二十日创造东北造纸业蒸煮时间最短的新纪录，一锅纸浆蒸煮时间缩短至十一小时零三十分，每锅产量为十七吨半，且产品均为特等品及一等品。该厂连创新纪录的主要原因是全厂职工发挥了积极性与创造性，提高了技术；同时逐渐建立各种先进科学制度，如责任制和交接班制，并严格执行了按技术规程操作和各车间密切配合制度等。
