Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 5th. Tang Zhendong, the culprit who helped the Japanese寇 [Kou is a derogatory term for the Japanese] murder the Northeast Anti-Japanese hero General Yang Jingyu ten years ago, has been captured and executed by our People's Government. The bandit Tang once served as "Commander of the Punitive Expeditionary Force" and "encircled and suppressed" General Yang Jingyu's troops of the First Route Army of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army in the Fushun and Mengjiang (now renamed Jingyu County) area in February 1940. General Yang Jingyu led his troops in a heroic resistance, but due to the disparity in numbers, he fought to the last man and heroically sacrificed himself. After the Japanese寇 [Kou is a derogatory term for the Japanese] surrendered, the bandit Tang immediately took refuge with the Kuomintang bandit gang and continued to do evil. After our army liberated Shenyang in 1948, the bandit hid in Shenyang City under the alias of Tang Xuezheng. In December of the same year, he was finally discovered and arrested by our city's Public Security Bureau. On August 24 this year, Fushun County held a public trial attended by more than 2,500 people. He was sentenced to death by the People's Court and executed by firing squad on the spot.

　　杀害杨靖宇将军的凶犯
    唐振东已就擒正法
    【新华社沈阳五日电】十年前帮助日寇杀害东北抗日英雄杨靖宇将军的凶犯唐振东，已为我人民政府捕获正法。唐匪曾任“讨伐大队长”，于一九四○年二月间在抚松、蒙江（现已更名为靖宇县）一带“围剿”抗日联军一路军杨靖宇将军所部。杨靖宇将军率部英勇抗击，终因众寡悬殊，战至最后一人，壮烈牺牲。日寇投降后，唐匪即投靠国民党匪帮，继续作恶。一九四八年我军解放沈阳后，该匪化名唐学政隐居沈市，同年十二月终被我市公安局发觉逮捕归案。今年八月二十四日，抚松县召开了两千五百余人的公审大会，经人民法院判处死刑，当场执行枪决。
