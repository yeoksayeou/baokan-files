    Xinhua News Agency, 9th. Thanks to the correct implementation of policies protecting and developing animal husbandry by People's Governments at all levels in Xinjiang Province, the total number of livestock in Xinjiang has increased by an average of 20 percent compared to last year, laying a preliminary foundation for increasing native products such as wool and hides this autumn.

　　In the major pastoral areas of Xinjiang, the People's Government strictly enforced the decision to prohibit the slaughter of young and breeding stock, focused on preventing livestock infectious diseases, and paid attention to adjusting water and grass resources, storing winter forage, and improving livestock breeds. In addition, the wages of herdsmen were appropriately adjusted. According to statistics from the Altay Special District, there are a total of 474,899 livestock this year, an increase of 20 percent compared to last year. This district has also built 3,000 houses this year, and by the end of November, 40 percent of the herdsmen will be able to gradually transition to a settled life. Tacheng Special District has a total of 1,284,822 livestock this year, an increase of 11 percent compared to last year. The development of sheep is the most significant, with newly born lambs accounting for 40 percent of the total of 1,093,000 sheep in the district. Livestock production in the Yili and Aksu Special Districts is also expected to increase by 10 percent this year. The People's Representative Conferences of all ethnic groups and sectors in the main pastoral areas of Yanqi Special District, including Heshuo, Hejing, and Yuli counties, have all made resolutions on developing animal husbandry production. Heshuo County has designated the areas with the best water and grass as pastures for grazing young livestock. Yuli County has corrected the past practice of eating large sheep and keeping small sheep, neglecting the breeding of superior livestock, so that the area's livestock production this year is expected to increase by about 30 percent compared to last year.

　　新疆畜牧业获得发展
    牲畜较去年平均增加百分之二十
    【新华社九日讯】新疆省各级人民政府正确执行保护和发展畜牧业政策，使全新疆的牲畜较去年平均增加百分之二十，为本年秋后羊毛、皮张等土产的增加奠定了初步基础。
    人民政府在新疆各主要畜牧区，严格执行禁止宰杀幼畜与种畜的决定，对牲畜的传染病亦作了重点预防，并注意调整水草，储存冬草，改良畜种等工作，此外还适当地调整了牧夫的工资。据阿山专区的统计：今年共有牲畜四十七万四千八百九十九只，比去年增加百分之二十。该区今年还修建房屋三千间，至本年十一月底，将有百分之四十的牧民，可逐步转为固定生活。塔城专区今年共有牲畜一百二十八万四千八百二十二只，较去年增加百分之十一。其中以羊的发展最大，该区今年新生的羔羊，即占全区所有一百零九万三千余只羊的百分之四十。伊犁专区和阿克苏专区今年牲畜亦可增产百分之十。焉耆专区的主要牧区和硕、和靖、尉犁三县的各民族各界人民代表会议对发展畜牧业生产，都作了决议。和硕县将水草最好的地方作为牧放幼畜的草场。尉犁县纠正了过去吃大羊，留小羊，不注意繁殖优良种畜的现象，使该区今年牲畜的产量，比去年可增加百分之三十左右。
