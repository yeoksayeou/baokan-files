Glorious, Historical Classroom
    Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive one. The decisive factor is people, not things. – Chairman Mao

    For those who come here, let the facts tell you what a tortuous and arduous path the birth of New China has gone through; a heroic path. Let the facts tell you how we started with ancient spears and broken guns and defeated enemies at home and abroad who possessed tanks and airplanes.

    It has been twenty-three years since the Nanchang Uprising – the day the Chinese People's Liberation Army was born. Here are two Mauser rifles and one pistol that participated in the Nanchang Uprising twenty-three years ago. These guns have been buried for so long that the gun bodies are rusted and the markings cannot be identified. Comrade Wang Fengfei, the owner of the guns, worked underground outside Nanchang City after the Nanchang Uprising. Later, he fled to Shanghai because of exposure. When he left, he instructed his sister-in-law to bury the guns. These guns were dug out from Comrade Wang Fengfei's home after the liberation of Nanchang. Twenty-three years have passed, and the bloodstains of Chiang Kai-shek's "April 12th" massacre are still very fresh. The weapons used by the martyrs who were deeply buried underground are today displayed in the sunshine before millions of people. The spirit of the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the Nanchang Uprising will always live in our hearts.

    Seeing the nine-shot rifle from Ruijin, as well as the ancient spears and seven-section whips used by the Red Guards during the Red Soviet era, one cannot help but recall the years of hard fighting during the land revolution. Wearing single clothes in winter, covering ourselves with straw at night, and climbing mountains barefoot, our Commander-in-Chief Zhu also carried a pole up the mountain to carry firewood. The heroic Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army once shattered five brutal encirclements and suppressions by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Comrade Liu Xiwen, the current political commissar of the 38th Division, seized a Mauser-style twenty-round pistol from the Kuomintang 19th Route Army when he shattered the Chiang bandits' third encirclement and suppression in Xingguo County, Jiangxi in 1933. In the struggle against national enemies and class enemies, he fought in various places. This pistol has accompanied him in battle for seventeen years. But during this time, the people in Jinggangshan suffered the ravages of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. When the White Army entered the Jinggangshan area, dense black smoke filled the mountains during the day, and the firelight illuminated the sky above Jinggangshan at night. Corpses were everywhere, and the streams changed color. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang almost killed all the people in Jinggangshan who had not managed to escape. Let this No. 4 mine from Baxi Township, Huangbai District, Ruijin County, Jiangxi Province, tell everyone how the heroes of the Red Soviet era persisted in the cruel struggle with the most primitive weapons.

    A photo of Hebei Wangdu County Liutuo Village militiamen using wooden sticks to seize a rifle from the Japanese invaders will deeply lead people into those cruel days of persisting in the anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines. The people of Liutuo Village are famous for their bravery. One morning in April 6, 1940, enemy and puppet troops surrounded Liutuo Village and captured fifty-nine young men and women. The barbaric Japanese fascists applied the most brutal tortures. The beasts used embroidery needles and pig bristles to pierce the fingernails of the victims; burned their flesh with red-hot irons; and stirred their bellies with bottles with broken mouths. However, the anti-Japanese people unanimously remained silent and did not yield. In the end, the enemy collectively massacred them at the Cypress Cemetery in Shenjiazhuang Village, southwest of Wangdu City. As they died, they shouted: "Down with Japanese imperialism!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" The people of Liutuo Village, who suffered the massacre by the Japanese invaders, were again subjected to the brutal attacks of the Kuomintang after the Anti-Japanese War. Those familiar with the history of this photo will know that this was after the Baonan Campaign in February 1947, when the people of Liutuo Village bravely intercepted the enemy. Wang Zhihua, fifty years old, used a horsewhip to capture an enemy, a horse, and a rifle. In this battle, the whole village used the most primitive weapons to seize two light machine guns, eighteen rifles, and captured thirty-four enemies. Wang Eryang, Liu Quan'er, and the other five people in the photo are the brave militiamen of Liutuo Village who seized five rifles with wooden sticks.

    Only by knowing how much blood and life we ​​have paid in exchange for today's victory can we understand our desire for peace and our iron will to defend peace. When the iron hooves of the Japanese invaders trampled on the beautiful rivers and mountains of our motherland, the people of our country, from the top of Changbai Mountain to the coast of the South China Sea, picked up all kinds of weapons to resist the enemy. From here, you can see the Li and Miao people of Hainan Island. When the Japanese invaders penetrated into Baisha, they beat ancient war drums, sounded ox horns, and used bamboo skewers used for hunting wild boars, inserted them on the roadside, and cooperated with the militia to stab the enemy to death. Seeing the various types of mines here, such as millstone mines, mother-and-son mines, jumping mines, and iron mines, one will naturally think of the ingenious and realistic minefields that the militiamen of the anti-Japanese base areas cleverly deployed for the enemy in the bloody battles with the Japanese invaders in North China. The enemy was afraid of landmines and dared not take the right path, so they walked on the grassland, walked in the riverbeds, broke through walls, walked through the holes in the walls, and even stepped on the footprints one after another. However, the terrible landmines seemed to follow them closely. Picking pumpkins would explode; moving benches would explode; operating the bellows for cooking would explode; opening and closing doors would explode; walking and climbing mountains would explode from their heads and waists. Wherever the enemy went, horses were overturned and vehicles crashed, and there was a burst of thunder.

    In the war, the brave and skilled militiamen, in addition to being good at using landmines to kill and injure the enemy, also created various weapons to kill the enemy. Liu Qingchang, a militia hero from Gaoyi County, Hebei Province, created a method of using black powder to fire iron sand to kill and injure people. Zhang Kecheng, a militia from Xushui County, created a three-eyed homemade cannon that used hand grenades as shells and fired them with rifle bullets, capable of firing three shells at a time. Liu Shazi, a militia hero from Zhengding County, Hebei Province, who has already heroically sacrificed himself, used hollow rusty iron tubes to convert them into grenade launchers. Liu Shazi, who was twenty-nine years old, could also convert firelocks into grenade-launching guns. When he saw mousetraps, he thought of ways to make landmine triggers. Liu Shazi and his comrades, when defending his hometown of Gaoping Village, more than once used homemade weapons to resist enemies more than ten times their number. While fighting, they also had to be careful to pick up bullet casings, and after the battle, they had to dig bullet heads from the ground. Liu Shazi and his guerrilla squad could reload a bullet fifteen or sixteen times. Liu Shazi's Mauser rifle never stopped firing in battle, but it always kept six bullets. It was in this way, in a situation of extreme shortage of bullets, that they persisted in the victorious battle.

    Here are various long and short guns, which "Transportation Captain" Chiang Kai-shek desperately transported from thirteen countries around the world. This is just a silhouette of the more than three million long and short guns seized from the Kuomintang army in the past four years. In addition to guns, here are various cannons.

    Among the many cannons, two are 150mm howitzers from the German Krupp and Solothurn armories, and facing the howitzers from afar are 105mm cannons. These cannons were originally scattered and abandoned by the Japanese invaders in the ice and snow of northern Manchuria. They were found by the heroes of our People's Liberation Army in the deep mountains and dense forests and in the frozen forests covered with snow up to their knees or chests for sixty consecutive days and nights, and found a total of twenty-three cannons and more than 11,000 parts. The heroes' great contribution to the motherland enabled our army's cannons to exert powerful power in the battles of Siping, Yixian, western Liaoning, Shenyang, Tianjin, and Hainan Island. Our artillerymen built positions in the severe cold of minus forty degrees; opened city walls, destroyed bunkers, and covered our infantry's charge; in the Hainan Island campaign, the enemy still thought that we did not have long-range cannons, but it was this cannon that sank the Chiang family bandit gang fleet's flagship "Taiping" warship.

    Our army originally had no tanks. This row of neat light and medium tanks, like all the tanks in our army, were seized from the enemy. At first, our soldiers had never seen tanks. When Cui Zhishan, a tank hero of the Fourth Field Army, and his comrades first saw tanks in Dehui, Jilin in February 1947, they thought they were the enemy's "trolleys." But it was they who destroyed three enemy tanks with hand grenades and pistols. The brave Cui Zhishan and his comrades climbed on the tanks, braving the artillery fire of the tanks, uncovered the lids, threw hand grenades in, and inserted pistols into the enemy's observation ports before destroying the tanks.

    We seized tanks from the enemy to arm ourselves, and at the same time, tank heroes appeared before the people. Shen Xu, a tank hero of the Third Field Army, was in the battle to attack Qianping Village in the Huaihai Campaign. His tank was hit by thirteen shells, and all the tracks were damaged. However, he and his wounded tank and comrades still persisted in fighting, silenced the enemy's artillery fire, and allowed the wounded tank to retreat safely. When we see the people's tanks before our eyes, we cannot help but recall the scene of our militiamen using "homemade tanks" to blast the enemy. At that time, we wanted to blow up city walls and bunkers, but sometimes we could not get close to the enemy. The militiamen created a kind of "homemade tank," which was made by folding dozens of quilts soaked in water and placing them on a wooden frame, and installing several wheels on the wooden frame. Under the cover of this homemade tank, they approached the enemy, and at the cost of flesh and blood, recovered every inch of the motherland's land. Kang Fushan, a famous Hebei Xingtang militia combat hero, is one of countless heroic militia heroes.

    Here, we can also clearly see the ferocious and robber-like face of American imperialism. They transported everything from ordinary bullets, long and short guns to amphibious tanks and airplanes from the distant United States to help the Kuomintang reactionaries massacre the Chinese people. Can our kind and hardworking people not have anger and hatred when they see the American-made landing tanks, amphibious vehicles, and aircraft wreckage here, and see these killing weapons?

    When teams of planes soar across the clear sky of our motherland, when majestic tanks and artillery groups gallop past the magnificent Tiananmen Square, we cannot help but recall those difficult days in the past, recall the days of hard fighting with spears, landmines, and broken guns. This fills us with the certainty of victory in the struggle with American imperialism. (Attached pictures)

　　光荣的，历史的课堂
    武器是战争的重要因素，但不是决定因素，决定的因素是人不是物。 ——毛主席
    陆灏
    来到这里的人，让事实告诉你，新中国的诞生，是走过了一条怎样曲折、艰苦的路程；英雄的路程。让事实告诉你，我们是怎样用古老的梭镖和破枪开始，打败了国内外拥有坦克和飞机的敌人。
    南昌起义——中国人民解放军诞生的日子，到现在已经二十三年了。这里有二十三年以前参加了南昌起义的两枝马枪和一枝手枪。这枪枝，长期的埋藏已使枪身锈烂无法辨明枪的标记。枪的主人王凤飞同志在南昌起义以后，曾在南昌市外作地下工作，后因暴露逃往上海，他走时嘱他的嫂嫂将枪枝埋藏起来，这枪是在南昌解放以后，在王凤飞同志的家里挖出来的。二十三年了，蒋介石“四一二”屠杀的血迹至今还很鲜浓，深埋在地下的烈士们使用过的武器，今天在阳光辉耀下陈列在千百万人民的面前，南昌起义牺牲的烈士们的精神是永远活在我们心里的。
    看见瑞金的九响步枪，以及红色苏维埃时代赤卫队用过的古老的梭镖和七节鞭，这不禁使人回忆起土地革命时期苦战的年月。穿着单衣过冬天，晚上盖稻草，赤着脚爬山，我们的朱总司令也扛着扁担上山担柴。英勇的中国工农红军曾经粉碎了蒋介石匪帮五次残酷的围剿。现在的三十八师政委刘西文同志，他一九三三年在江西兴国县粉碎蒋匪三次围剿的时候，缴获了当时国民党十九路军的一枝毛瑟式的二十发手枪。在和民族敌人阶级敌人的斗争中，他转战各地，这手枪，已经陪伴他战斗了十七年。但就在这个时间里，井岗山上的人民，受尽了蒋介石匪帮的蹂躏，当白军进入井岗山区的时候，在六十里方圆内，白天满山冒着浓密的黑烟，夜晚火光照红了井岗山上的天空，遍山尸首，溪水变色，蒋介石匪帮几乎杀光了井岗山上没有逃及的人。让这颗来自江西瑞金县黄柏区霸溪乡的第四号地雷告诉每一个人，红色苏维埃时代的英雄们，怎样用最原始的武器坚持了残酷的斗争。
    一张河北望都县柳陀村民兵用木棒缴获日寇步枪的照片，它会深沉地将人引入坚持敌后抗战那些残酷的日子。柳陀村的人民以英勇著名。一九四○年四月六日的一个早晨，敌伪军包围了柳陀村，捕去了五十九个青年男女，野蛮的日本法西斯强盗施用了最残暴的毒刑。野兽们用绣花针和猪鬃刺进被难者的指甲；用烧红的烙铁烫他们的肉；用打掉嘴的瓶子搅插她们的肚子。但是，抗日的人民一致闭口不言，没有屈服，最后敌人把他们集体残杀在望都城的西南沈家庄村的柏树坟上。他们临死的时候喊着：“打倒日本帝国主义！”“中国共产党万岁！”遭受日寇屠杀的柳陀村的人民在抗日战争以后，又遭到国民党残暴的进攻。熟悉这张照片历史的人，会知道这是一九四七年二月保南战役以后，柳陀村的人民勇敢的截击敌人。五十岁的王志华，他用一根马鞭子，俘虏了一个敌人、一匹马和一枝步枪。全村在这个战役中，用最原始的武器，缴获了两挺轻机枪，十八枝步枪和俘虏了三十四个敌人。照片上的王二羊、刘全儿等五个人，就是用木棍缴获了五枝步枪的勇敢的柳陀村的民兵。
    只有知道了我们曾付出多少鲜血和生命换取了今天的胜利，才能够懂得我们对于和平的渴望以及对于保卫和平钢铁般的意志。当日本侵略者的兽蹄践踏我祖国锦绣山河的时候，我国人民从长白山巅到南海边，拿起各种各样的武器抗击敌人。从这里可以看到海南岛的黎民、苗民，当日寇深入白沙的时候，他们敲起古老的战锣，鸣起牛角，用打山猪用的竹签，插在路旁，配合民兵，刺死敌人。看见这里的磨盘雷、子母雷、跳雷、铁雷等各种各样的地雷，就会自然想起在华北和日本侵略者的血战中，抗日根据地的民兵们为敌人巧妙布置的、虚虚实实的地雷阵。敌人怕地雷不敢走正路，就走青草地，走小河道，打穿墙，从墙洞里走，甚至是一个脚印跟着一个脚印踩着走。但是，可怕的地雷好像紧紧跟着他们一样。摘北瓜会炸；搬凳子会炸；做饭拉风箱会炸；开门关门会炸；走路爬山，会从头上腰间爆炸。敌人所到之处，马仰车翻，一片雷声。
    英勇善战的民兵们在战争中，除了善于运用地雷杀伤敌人，并且还创造各种杀敌的武器。河北高邑县的民兵杀敌英雄刘庆昌同志创造利用黑药发射铁砂子杀伤杀人，徐水县民兵张克诚创造用手榴弹当炮弹，用步枪弹发射，一次能发三个炮弹的三眼土炮。已经英勇牺牲的河北正定县的民兵杀敌英雄刘傻子，他用两头空的锈铁筒改制掷弹筒。二十九岁的刘傻子还能把火枪改制成掷弹枪，他看到老鼠夹子就想办法做了地雷触发器。刘傻子和他的战友们，在保卫他的家乡高平村的时候，他们不止一次地用土造的武器抗击多于自己十余倍的敌人。他们一面打仗，一面还要留心拣子弹壳，战斗完了，还要从地里掘子弹头。刘傻子和他的游击小队的一颗子弹可以改装十五、六次。刘傻子的一枝毛瑟枪，在战斗中没有停止过射击，但一直保持了六颗子弹。就是这样在子弹奇缺的情形下，坚持了胜利的战斗。
    这里有各种长短枪，这是“运输大队长”蒋介石拼命从全世界十三个国家运送来的。这不过是四年来缴获国民党军队三百多万支长短枪的一个侧影。除了枪，这里就是各种各样的大炮。
    在很多的大炮当中，有二尊是德国克虏伯和苏罗通兵工厂出的一五○公厘的榴弹炮，和榴弹炮遥对的是一○五公厘的加农炮。这大炮，本来是零碎的被日寇遗弃在北满的冰雪里。是我们人民解放军的英雄们，在深山密林和冰天雪地里寻找得到的。我们的搜炮英雄周天才，他和他的连队，从图们江到黑龙江，走遍了无人的深山，在深及膝盖或胸口的冰雪封冻的森林中，连续六十昼夜，前后寻到了大炮二十三门和一万一千多件零件。英雄们对于祖国的重大贡献，使我军的大炮在四平、义县、辽西、沈阳直到天津、海南岛的战役中，发挥了强大的威力。我们的炮兵在零下四十度的严寒里构筑阵地；打开城墙，摧毁碉堡掩护我们的步兵冲锋；在海南岛战役里，敌人还以为我们没有远射程的大炮，但就是这一门加农炮，击沉了蒋家匪帮舰队的旗舰“太平”号。
    我们的军队本来并没有坦克，这里一排整齐的轻中型坦克，和我军所有的坦克一样，都夺自敌人的手中。起初，我们的战士就没有见过坦克，一九四七年二月第四野战军的坦克英雄崔志山和他的战友们在吉林德惠第一次见到坦克的时候，还以为这是敌人的“电车”，但也就是他们用手榴弹和驳壳枪击毁了敌人三辆坦克。勇敢的崔志山和他的战友们，是冒着坦克射击的炮火爬在坦克上面，揭开了盖子，把手榴弹扔进去，把驳壳枪插进敌人的了望口才击毁了坦克的。
    我们从敌人手中夺取了坦克武装了自己，我们又同时有坦克英雄出现在人民面前。第三野战军的坦克英雄沈许在淮海战役进攻前平庄的战斗中，他的坦克中了十三发炮弹，履带全受了伤，然而他和他的受伤的坦克和战友们仍然坚持作战，打哑了敌人的炮火，使负伤的坦克得以安全撤退。当我们眼前见到人民的坦克，这不禁使人回想起我们的民兵用“土坦克”爆破敌人的情景。那时候，我们要爆炸城墙和碉堡，有时就无法接近敌人。民兵们创造了一种“土坦克”，这是在接近敌人一、二百米达甚至是几十米达的时候，用几十床浸过水的被套叠起来，放在一个木架上，木架上按装几个轮子，就在这种土坦克的掩护下接近敌人，用血肉的代价收复祖国每一寸土地。著名的河北行唐民兵战斗英雄康福山，就是这样无数英勇的民兵英雄当中的一个。
    在这里，我们还特别清楚看到美国帝国主义者凶恶的强盗面孔。他们从普通的子弹、长短枪到水陆坦克和飞机，从遥远的美国运来帮助国民党反动派屠杀中国人民。我国善良勤劳的人民，看到这里的美制登陆坦克、水陆两用汽车以及飞机的残骸，看到这些杀人的武器，能没有愤怒和没有仇恨吗？
    当成队的飞机翱翔的飞过我们祖国晴朗天空的时候，当雄壮的坦克和大炮群驰过庄丽的天安门前的时候，我们不禁回忆起过去那些艰难的日子，回忆起用梭镖、地雷、破枪苦战的日子。这就使我们对于和美国帝国主义的斗争充满了必胜的信心。（附图片）
