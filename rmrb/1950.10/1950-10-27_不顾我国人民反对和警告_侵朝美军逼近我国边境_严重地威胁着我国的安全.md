　　Ignoring the opposition and warnings of the Chinese people,
    The invading American army is closing in on our border,
    Seriously threatening our security.
    [Xinhua News Agency, October 26th] Ignoring the opposition and warnings of the Chinese people, the American aggressors are frantically extending the flames of their war of aggression against Korea to our northeastern border. According to a United Press report on the 25th, "A spokesman for the US First Army Corps said on the 25th that the commander of the US Eighth Army has ordered American and British troops to advance towards the Sino-Korean border with any necessary force." A United Press report on the 24th also stated, "The US 24th Division crossed the Chongchon River today (the 24th) to join the British and South Korean armies in their northward advance towards the Chinese northeastern border." Prior to this, according to an Associated Press report from Seoul on the 22nd, five divisions of the Syngman Rhee puppet army had been ordered by MacArthur to advance as quickly as possible towards the Chinese northeastern border. The American aggressors' marine corps and air force will provide assistance at any time. Another Associated Press dispatch also stated that MacArthur had instructed Walker, the commander of the US Eighth Army, on the 20th to "dispatch South Korean troops to advance rapidly towards the Chinese northeastern border." A United Press report from Wonsan on the 21st also stated, "General Almond, the commander of the Tenth Army, within hours of taking office as the commander of the Korean northeastern war zone, ordered the entire South Korean First Army to advance towards the Chinese northeastern border." According to a United Press report from Tokyo on the 23rd, the British and Australian 27th Brigade, acting as accomplices of the US invading army, is also advancing towards Sinuiju, which is adjacent to the Chinese border. These acts of aggression by American imperialism are seriously threatening our security.
    [Xinhua News Agency, October 26th] TASS reported: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Democratic Republic Army announced on the 25th that People's Army units are conducting defensive battles on all fronts against the invading US and South Korean troops.
    In the areas north and northeast of Pyongyang, People's Army units have withdrawn to new defensive positions under the advance of superior enemy forces, covered by air force.
    On the east coast, People's Army units are conducting defensive battles against the invading enemy forces in the areas north of Hamhung, north of Bukchong, and in the northeast.

    【新华社二十六日讯】美国侵略者不顾中国人民的反对和警告，正在疯狂地把侵朝战争的火焰，扩至我国东北边境。据合众社二十五日电，“美国第一军团发言人二十五日称：美第八军长已命令美英两国军队以任何必需的兵力，向中朝边境推进。”合众社二十四日电亦称，“美军第二十四师已于今日（二十四日）渡过清川江，参加英军与南韩军向中国东北边境北进。”在此以前，据美联社汉城二十二日电透露：李承晚伪军五个师已奉麦克阿瑟的命令，尽速向中国东北边境前进。美国侵略者的陆战队与航空队则将随时加以援助。美联社另电又称：麦克阿瑟并已于二十日训令美第八军军长瓦克，“调遣南韩军队火速向中国东北边界前进”。合众社元山二十一日电亦称，“第十军军长阿尔梦德将军于其就任韩国东北战区司令官数小时，即令南韩第一军全军向中国东北边境前进。”又据合众社东京二十三日电称：作为美侵略军帮凶的英澳军第二十七旅，亦正在向着邻近中国边境的新义州进犯。美帝国主义的这些侵略行动，正严重地威胁着我国的安全。
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部二十五日发表战报称：人民军部队正在各战线对进犯的美军和南朝鲜军队进行防御战。
    在平壤以北及东北地区，人民军部队在由空军掩护的优势敌军的进犯下，撤至新的防御阵地。
    在东海岸，人民军部队正在咸兴以北和北青以北及东北地区，对进犯的敌军进行防御战。
