New Book and Journal Introductions

*World Knowledge* Issue 15
The international affairs weekly *World Knowledge*, Volume 22, Issue 15, was published on the 15th of this month. This issue features an editorial entitled "Oppose the New American Plot to Invade Taiwan!" which denounces the United States' blatant and shameless occupation of our sacred territory, Taiwan Province. In particular, the editorial condemns the US for once again using its voting machine at the United Nations General Assembly to shamelessly include the "Taiwan issue" proposed by the US on the agenda of the UN General Assembly. The US plot is to attempt to submit a proposal to the United Nations General Assembly that masks the already established fact of its occupation of Taiwan, to overturn all international agreements regarding Taiwan, such as the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, through an illegal resolution of the General Assembly, and to erase the fact that Taiwan has been returned to China since the Japanese surrender. The editorial states: The victorious Chinese people are highly vigilant against this new plot and new challenge of American imperialism. Regardless of the US proposing a motion to the United Nations that insults the Chinese people and violates the UN Charter, the Chinese people are determined to liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan from the hands of the looters. Furthermore, we must accuse and expose these notorious crimes of American imperialism to the people of the world.

This issue includes special articles such as Lu Min's "Two Proposals for Solving the Korean Problem," Chen Hanbo's "The United States Cannot Escape the Judgment of Justice," Ye Mang's "On the Stage of the United Nations General Assembly," and Wang Jingran's "The American Economy Since the Invasion of the Korean War." This issue also includes a special translation of a piece from the *Crocodile* magazine entitled "Collection of Criminal Photographs," which uses satirical language to vividly depict the crimes of several warmongers such as Truman, Churchill, Acheson, and MacArthur.

*Beijing Literature* Issue 2
*Beijing Literature*, a monthly magazine edited by the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, published its second issue on the 10th. This issue features a special selection of "Special Issue Commemorating National Day" and "Model Heroes Special." The former is written by workers, students, writers, artists, etc., and the latter includes Miao Peishi's "Model Factory Director," Yang Zhensheng's "First-Class People's Hero of East China, Liu Kuiji," Duanmu Hongliang's "White Tiger Company," and Huang Zhen's "Singing of Liu Jinrong," etc. In addition, this issue also published Hu Man's paper: "On the Issue of New Year Picture Work," Bi Ye's novel: "Old White Head and Little Liu Monkey," Lao She's play: "Dragon Beard Ditch," Zhang Zhimin's poem: "Gathering of Heroes" and other sketches, reports, songs, drawings, etc.

It also published a commentary "Improve the Theoretical Study Methods of On-the-Job Cadres," providing some principled opinions on "organizing on-the-job cadres to study by using classes and self-study." The essays in this issue include Wu Jiang's "The Common Program and Ideological Work," Di Chaobai's "The Nature and Law of Various Profits in the Transition Period," Ye Huosheng's "The Land Question in Chinese History."

The "Semi-Monthly Talk" column published four articles: "Qualifications", "The First Step of the Mass Line", "Two Minds", and "Starting from Making a Phone Call"; the "Reader Discussion" column published three discussion articles on "How Should Comrade Wang Dingchen Be Helped to Carry Out Ideological Reform?". The "Question and Answer" column answered five questions, including "Is the rich peasant economy in rural areas before the land reform a capitalist economy or a feudal economy? If the rich peasant economy in rural China is capitalist in nature, then is the policy of collecting surplus land property from rich peasants in the past to eliminate capitalism in rural areas? If the rich peasant economy in China is of a feudal exploitative nature, then is the current policy of not touching the land property of rich peasants to preserve the feudal exploitative system?" and five other questions.
