(I) Address of the Bulgarian Ambassador to China

Mr. Chairman:

I have the honor to present to you the credentials from the Presidium of the National Assembly of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, appointing me as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to your country.

The Bulgarian people have followed with great concern and sympathy the heroic struggle of the great Chinese people to win the liberation of their motherland, to guarantee the independence and sovereignty of their country, and to resist the aggression of foreign imperialist elements who seek to enslave China.

Mr. Chairman, please allow me, on this solemn occasion, to express, in the name of the Bulgarian people and the Bulgarian government, my heartfelt respect to you and the great and heroic Chinese people; and to congratulate the Chinese people on the victories they have achieved in the struggle against reactionaries, against domestic and foreign enemies, and on the tremendous achievements in national, economic, social, and cultural construction since the establishment of the great People's Republic of China.

These achievements have created vast possibilities for the development of friendly relations between Bulgaria and China, for cooperation between our two peoples, and for the consolidation of the cause of peace and democracy led by the Soviet Union.

In taking up my position as Ambassador of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, I will do my utmost to develop and consolidate the fraternal relations between our two peoples, and, Mr. Chairman, I hope to receive your assistance and cooperation in this endeavor.

(II) Chairman's Reply

Mr. Ambassador:

I am very pleased to accept the credentials from the Presidium of the National Assembly of the People's Republic of Bulgaria presented by Your Excellency, and I thank you for your warm congratulations.

There is a deep friendship between the peoples of China and Bulgaria. The Bulgarian people's heroic struggle against domestic and foreign reactionaries under the leadership of the great leader Dimitrov, as well as their current achievements in economic and cultural construction, have always been deeply cared for and admired by the Chinese people. Now that the Chinese people's revolution has basically triumphed, and diplomatic relations between China and Bulgaria have been established, I believe that this will not only further develop and consolidate the friendship between our two peoples, but will also strengthen the power of the world peace and democracy camp.

I warmly welcome Your Excellency as the first Ambassador Extraordinary
