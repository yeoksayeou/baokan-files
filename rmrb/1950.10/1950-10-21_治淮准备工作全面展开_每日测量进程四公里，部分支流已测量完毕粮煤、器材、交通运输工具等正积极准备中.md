[Comprehensive report from our newspaper] In order to carry out the large-scale Huai River harnessing project, the Anhui North People's Administrative Office is leading the people to fully launch various preparatory tasks.

The Huai River Water Conservancy Engineering General Bureau and the Huai River Mid- and Downstream Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau dispatched ten survey teams totaling more than 250 people in mid-August to conduct surveying work along the main and tributary streams of the Huai River and the Hongze Lake area in northern Anhui. Some of the surveys have already been completed. According to reports from the two survey teams dispatched by the Administrative Office's Water Conservancy Bureau, each team measures four kilometers per day. Their original planned survey scope included the dike lines on both banks of the Pi River (a tributary of the Huai River) from Yinji to Zhengyangguan, as well as the Linwang section, Sanhejian encirclement dike, and Shouxi Huai dike in the middle reaches of the Huai River, with a total dike line length of approximately 300 kilometers. It was estimated that it would take 40 clear days to complete the entire survey. The completed areas include the main dikes on both banks of Zhengyangguan, the Sanhejian encirclement dike, and some Pi River tributaries. Engineering is actively being planned in the surveyed areas in preparation for construction to begin.

The Sui River surveying project in the Suxian Special District began on August 11. The survey of the new river channel from Yinji to Hongze Lake was completed on the 26th after 15 days of effort. The indoor work has now been completed, and the new Sui River line is being explored as a reference for planning work. Engineering personnel from the special commissioner's office are also cooperating with the Yangtze River surveying team to survey the Tang River from Chantang to the western section of Yongcheng, which is expected to take half a month to complete. The Hongze Lake team has decided to first survey the section of the Tang River and Tuo River estuary to Chantang.

The mechanical engineering team and dredgers dispatched by the Huai River Water Conservancy Engineering General Bureau began dredging the shallow waters of the Huai River above Zhengyangguan, covering more than 40 li, on September 12.

In order to adapt to the large number of workers needed during construction, the Anhui North People's Administrative Office has established a 3,000-person training class for Huai River workers. After short-term training, they will be assigned to manage the lives of the Huai River laborers and conduct education and recreational activities.

The Anhui North Production Relief and Huai River Harnessing Temporary Headquarters (special districts such as Fuyang and Suxian have also been established successively) began moving from Hefei to Bengbu for office work on the 5th of last month. Huang Yan, director of the Anhui North People's Administrative Office, serves as commander, and Zeng Xisheng, secretary of the Anhui North District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, serves as political commissar. The Health Department of the headquarters has initially formulated a plan to establish 24 health sections, 72 epidemic prevention stations, 288 health clinics, and 250 outpatient clinics in each engineering section after the large-scale Huai River harnessing project begins, specifically for the prevention and treatment of diseases for the laborers.

Because the number of various materials required for the Huai River harnessing project is enormous, the headquarters has taken several measures within its capabilities: 1. Regarding the supply of food for the river workers, the Finance and Grain Supply Department of the headquarters has established four directly subordinate grain transfer stations in Bengbu, Linhuai Pass, Bagong Mountain, and Tianjia'an, responsible for receiving grain transferred from outside the region and distributing it to the various special districts. 2. Regarding the transportation of grain, grass, and equipment, the Transportation Department of the Anhui North Administrative Office estimates that all vehicles and ships in northern Anhui may not be sufficient to meet the needs of material transfer within the region. The Finance and Grain Supply Department has decided to mobilize and organize all transportation vehicles as much as possible and prepare to request assistance from the East China Military and Political Committee and friendly neighboring regions such as northern Jiangsu, southern Jiangsu, and Shandong. The Transportation Department of the Anhui North Administrative Office and the Finance and Grain Supply Department of the headquarters dispatched personnel in September to cooperate with various special districts to inspect highway bridges and have mobilized manpower to repair damaged areas to avoid obstacles after transportation work begins. The headquarters has also dispatched cadres to various main and tributary rivers to mobilize and organize ships. The Bengbu Huai River Transportation Office has organized large ships with a load capacity of more than 30,000 jin into 33 transportation groups, totaling 179 civilian ships, with a load capacity of nearly 10 million jin. They began loading coal at Bagong Mountain on the 21st of last month. The office has also decided to mobilize all steamers and motorboats on the Huai River, except for those reserved for short- and long-distance passenger tickets, to participate in the Huai River transportation work. Shipowners from northern and southern Jiangsu have also sent people to Bengbu to negotiate participation in the Huai River transportation work. The Nanjing Xiangzi Transportation Cooperative has also brought 80 sailboats with a total load capacity of more than 50 million jin to Bengbu to participate in the Huai River transportation work. 3. Regarding the supply of firewood, the central government has approved the allocation of 520,000 tons of coal to meet the needs of laborers burning coal and providing coal for disaster relief. The first batch of 200 million jin of coal has begun to be transported to the three special districts of Fuyang, Suxian, and Lu'an. The Finance and Grain Supply Department has established a firewood purchasing general station in Zhengyangguan, responsible for purchasing bamboo, wood, and firewood from the Dabie Mountain area; and established purchasing branch stations in Bengbu and Tianjia'an.

Regarding the various tools needed for the river works, the headquarters has decided that laborers will generally bring their own; for laborers in severely affected disaster areas, the government will prepare a portion to supplement them. 180 stone rollers have been transported to various engineering offices. Other equipment such as water pumps, waterwheels, transportation vehicles, and other large tools and machinery are also being repaired, refitted, or ordered. In order to prepare for larger culverts and dangerous sections, 2,500 laborers have been mobilized in Fengtai through work-for-relief to mine 40,000 stone strips, 60,000 cubic meters of stones, and 10,000 cubic meters of crushed stones, striving to start work in late October.

    治淮准备工作全面展开
    每日测量进程四公里，部分支流已测量完毕粮煤、器材、交通运输工具等正积极准备中
    【本报综合讯】为大规模进行治准工程，皖北人民行署正领导人民全面展开各项准备工作。
    淮河水利工程总局及淮河中、下游水利工程局早于八月中旬即派出十个勘测队共二百五十多人，分赴皖北沿淮河干、支流及洪泽湖地区进行测量工作，部分已测量完毕。测量工作进度，据行署水利局所派的两个测量队汇报，每队每日测量进程为四公里。他们原定测量范围为淠河（淮河支流）下游隐贤集至正阳关左右两岸堤线，及淮河中游之临王段、三河尖圈堤、寿西淮堤等，堤线共长约三百公里，估计有四十个晴天即可全部完成。现已测完的有正阳关两岸干堤、三河尖圈堤及部分淠河支流。测完地区正积极规划工程，准备开工。
    宿县专区濉河测量工程自八月十一日开始，测量由尹集到洪泽湖之新河道，经十五日努力，于二十六日即全部测量完毕，现室内工作均已告结束，并开始濉河新线勘查，以作规划工作参考。专署工程人员则又配合长江测量队，出发测量唐河，由禅堂到永城西一段，预计半个月始能完成测量工作。洪泽湖队则决定先测量唐河、沱河口至禅堂一段。
    淮河水利工程总局派出的机械工程队和挖泥船，已于九月十二日开始疏浚正阳关以上四十余华里的淮河浅滩。
    为了适应施工时所需要的大批工作人员，皖北人民行署已举办三千人的治淮河工作人员训练班，经过短期训练后，将分配担任治淮民工的生活管理及教育、文娱等工作。
    皖北生产救灾治淮临时指挥部（阜阳、宿县等专区也已先后成立）已于上月五日起开始由合肥迁往蚌埠办公，由皖北人民行署主任黄岩任司令、中共皖北区委员会书记曾希圣任政治委员。该部卫生处已初步拟定计划，准备在大规模治淮工程开始后，在各工程地段设立二十四个卫生科，七十二个防疫站，二百八十八个卫生所和二百五十个门诊所，专为民工防疫治病。
    因为治淮工程所需要的各种器材的数量十分巨大，指挥部已在可能范围内采取了几项措施：一、河工粮的供应问题，已由指挥部财粮供应处在蚌埠、临淮关、八公山和田家庵，建立了四个直属粮食转运站，负责自外区调来粮食的接收和向各专区分发。二、粮、草和器材的运输，据皖北行署交通处估计，皖北境内所有车船等运输工具，可能不敷境内物资调运的需要。财粮供应处决定尽可能动员组织所有交通工具，并准备请华东军政委员会和苏北、苏南、山东等友邻区予以协助。皖北行署交通处和指挥部财粮供应处，已于九月份派人配合各专区，进行公路桥梁的检查，并已动员人力抢修被损坏地方，以免运输工作开始后发生障碍。指挥部并已派出干部，到各干支河流动员组织船只，计蚌埠治淮运输办事处已将载重三万斤以上的大船组织起来，组成了三十三个运输组，共计民船一百七十九只，载重量近千万斤，已于上月二十一日开始陆续往八公山装运煤斤。该处并决定将淮河所有轮船、机船，除留长短班客票船外，其余全部动员投入治淮运输工作。苏北、苏南船主，亦纷纷派人至蚌埠接洽参加治淮运输工作。南京湘资运输合作社亦以载重共达五千余万斤的帆船八十只，来蚌参加治淮的运输工作。三、柴草供应，中央已批准拨给五十二万吨煤，作为民工烧煤和救济灾民烧煤的需要。第一批拨下的二亿斤煤，已开始运住阜阳、宿县和六安三专区。财粮供应处已在正阳关设柴草收购总站，负责收购大别山一带的竹、木和柴草；另在蚌埠和田家庵设收购分站。
    河工所需用的各种工具，指挥部决定：一般由民工自带；重灾区灾民所使用的工具，由公家准备一部分补充。一百八十块石硪已运往各地工程处。其余如抽水机、水车、交通工具，以及其他大型工具、器械等也正在修理、改装或订购中。为备较大涵闸及险段需要，已在凤台以工代赈动员二千五百名民工开采四万条石条，六万方石块，一万方碎石，争取十月下旬开工。
