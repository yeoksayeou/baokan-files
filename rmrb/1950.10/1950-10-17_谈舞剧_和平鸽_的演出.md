　　On the Performance of the Dance Drama "Peace Dove"
    Guang Weiran
    The dance drama "Peace Dove," created by Comrade Ouyang Yuqian, starring Comrade Dai Ailian, and performed by the Central Academy of Drama Dance Troupe, is a beneficial contribution to strengthening the propaganda of the international peace movement and to the construction of China's new dance art.

    "Peace Dove" depicts the magnificent upsurge of the world's people defending the peace movement under the illumination of the Soviet Union, the lighthouse of human peace that breaks through the dark clouds of war; it exposes the outwardly strong but inwardly weak ugliness of the imperialist warmongers; and praises the unwavering belief and indomitable fighting spirit of the peace fighters! It emphasizes the heavy blow that the struggle of the Asian people gave to the imperialist camp; especially the great role of the victory of the Chinese revolution for human peace, and the determination of the Chinese people and national defense soldiers to defend peace.

    All these magnificent poetic contents of international political life are expressed through the form of dance; and the activities of the Peace Dove are used to connect them. In this dance drama, the Peace Dove is beautified as a symbol of peace and also as a symbol of peace fighters. Comrade Dai Ailian has created for us the image of a pure, beautiful, lively, enthusiastic, and firm Peace Dove.

    Dance drama is a high-level refinement of real life. We cannot demand that it "translate" the concepts of political life into dance images in a simplistic way, nor can we demand that the creation of dance images conform to the reality of life details everywhere. The expressive method of dance is closest to poetry and closest to the expressive method of music. What we require first is the authenticity of emotion, that is, the fleshing out of ideological concepts. When we measure a political poem, we first want to see whether it truly expresses the feelings of the people, the feelings of the times, and revolutionary feelings. On this point, I think "Peace Dove" has its own achievements.

    China's dance art is a young art. It needs to learn extensively from folk dances in various places, from the dances of fraternal ethnic groups in the border areas, from the dance elements of Chinese old operas, and also from foreign dances and dance dramas; the purpose is to create a national form of new dance art that the Chinese people love. Our dance troupe has had preliminary success in learning folk dances, ethnic dances, and the dances of Chinese old operas, and should continue to insist on learning with great efforts. The performance of "Peace Dove" uses more Western dance techniques and methods, which is in line with the requirements of the content of the script and is completely understandable. As long as we think that after the foreign drama form is combined with the actual life of the Chinese people and accepted by the Chinese people, it will quickly become one of our national forms, and it will have a major impact on today's new opera creation and old opera reform, we will know that it is necessary to learn Western dance. The performance of a large-scale dance drama like "Peace Dove" is the first attempt in our country (song and dance drama is another matter); one attempt does not represent a definite direction, and a definite direction is summarized and affirmed from multiple purposeful practices. Even so, I think this bold attempt is still very beneficial. We can further clarify many problems and accumulate important experiences and lessons by absorbing the valuable opinions of the audience and the constructive criticisms of the art circles, which will be conducive to future creations.

    I hope that under the efforts of Comrade Ouyang Yuqian and Comrade Dai Ailian, as well as all the comrades of the dance troupe, they will continue to give play to their creativity, express the epic of the Chinese people's struggle in the form of dance drama, further combine with the people's thoughts and feelings, and shape the heroic and magnificent image of the working people; therefore, in the performance, it must be more of a display of the excellent parts of national dance, and the rhythm of the new life must be dance-ized, and the dance character of the new characters must be characterized.

    The performance of "Peace Dove" is very timely. This year's World Peace Struggle Day is when the struggle between justice and evil, the peace movement and war blackmail is becoming increasingly acute. The eyes of progressive humanity around the world will pay attention to Beijing—the pillar of peace in the Far East. Whether we effectively cooperate with this movement in art, and whether we reflect the Chinese people's determination to defend peace, is of great significance. Therefore, the performance of "Peace Dove" is a very meaningful thing.

　　谈舞剧“和平鸽”的演出
    光未然
    由欧阳予倩同志编制、戴爱莲同志主演、中央戏剧学院舞蹈团演出的舞剧“和平鸽”，对于加强国际和平运动的宣传，对于中国新舞蹈艺术的建设，都是有益的贡献。
    “和平鸽”表现了在冲破战争乌云的人类和平灯塔——苏联的照耀下，世界人民保卫和平运动的波澜壮阔的激潮；它揭露了帝国主义战争贩子外强中干的丑态；歌颂了和平战士的必胜信念和不屈不挠的斗争精神！它强调地描写了亚洲人民的斗争给予帝国主义阵营的沉重打击；特别是中国革命的胜利对于人类和平的伟大作用，以及中国人民大众和国防战士们保卫和平的决心。
    所有这些国际政治生活中的壮美的诗的内容，都通过舞蹈的形式表现出来；而以和平之鸽的活动把它们贯穿起来。和平鸽在这个舞剧中，是作为和平的象征，同时也作为和平战士的象征而被美化了。戴爱莲同志替我们创造了纯真、美丽、活泼、热情而又坚定的和平鸽的形象。
    舞剧是现实生活高度的提炼。我们不能要求它把政治生活的概念，用简单化的方法“翻译”为舞蹈的形象，我们也不能要求舞蹈形象的创造，处处符合于生活细节的真实。舞蹈的表现方法，最接近于诗，最接近于音乐的表现方法。我们首先要求的是感情的真实，即思想概念的血肉化。我们衡量一首政治诗，首先要看它是否真实地表现了人民的感情、时代的感情、革命的感情。在这一点上，我觉得“和平鸽”是有它一定的成就的。
    我国的舞蹈艺术是一种年青的艺术，它需要广泛地向各地民间的舞蹈学习，向边疆各兄弟民族的舞蹈学习，向中国旧剧的舞蹈成分学习，同时也向外国的舞蹈及舞剧学习；其目的则是创造中国人民喜爱的新舞蹈艺术的民族形式。我们的舞蹈团，在学习民间舞、民族舞及中国旧剧的舞蹈方面，曾经有初步的成效，还应继续大力地坚持学下去。“和平鸽”的表演，则是更多地运用了西洋舞蹈的技巧和方法，这是符合于剧本内容要求的，也是完全可以理解的。我们只要想到外国的话剧形式和中国人民的生活实际结合并被中国人民接受之后，也就很快地变成了我们的民族形式之一，且在今天的新歌剧创造及旧剧改革中产生重大的影响，我们就知道对于西洋舞蹈的学习是必要的了。像“和平鸽”这样大型舞剧的演出，在我国还是第一次的尝试（歌舞剧是另一回事）；一次的尝试并不代表一种肯定的方向，肯定的方向是从多次的目的性明确的实践中总结与肯定下来的。虽然如此，我觉得这次大胆的尝试还是很有益处，我们可以在吸收观众宝贵的意见与艺术界建设性的批评中，进一步明确很多问题，积累重要的经验教训，而有利于以后的创造。
    我希望在欧阳予倩同志和戴爱莲同志以及舞蹈团全体同志的努力下，继续地发挥创造，以舞剧的形式表现中国人民斗争的史诗，更进一步和人民的思想感情相结合，塑造劳动人民英勇壮美的形象；因而在表演上，也一定是更多地发挥了民族舞蹈的优秀部分，并且把新生活的节奏舞蹈化，把新人物的舞蹈性格化。
    “和平鸽”的上演是非常合乎时宜的。今年的世界和平斗争日，正当着正义与邪恶，和平运动与战争敲诈的斗争日益尖锐化的时候，全世界进步人类的眼光会注意到北京——远东和平的支柱。我们在艺术上是否有力地配合了这个运动，是否反映了中国人民保卫和平的决心，关系是非常巨大的。因此，“和平鸽”的上演，是件很有意义的事。
