　　[Beijing News Agency Report] The Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee held its ninth meeting at 2:00 PM on the 27th, presided over by Chairman Peng Zhen, with thirty committee members in attendance.

　　The meeting first discussed the election of representatives for the third Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference. The second People's Representative Conference was convened on November 20th of last year, nearly a year ago. According to Article 2 of the "Organizational Regulations of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference": the term of office for the representatives of the People's Representative Conference is temporarily set at one year. Therefore, the term of office for the representatives of the current (second) conference is about to expire, and the issue of generating representatives for the next (third) conference must be decided by the Consultative Committee. After discussion, it was decided to re-elect on schedule, and Wu Han, Liu Ren, Yu Xinqing, Xue Zizheng, Li Leguang, Cao Zhilin, Guo Zechen, Xiao Ming, Zhang Zhixiang, Zhang Xiaomei, Gu Qizong, Li Bozhao, Dong Ruqin, Cui Yueli, Fu Huating, and fifteen others were nominated to form a committee, with Wu Han as the director, responsible for preparatory work, and to submit specific measures for adoption by the Consultative Committee.

　　The meeting then discussed the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionary activities, with Luo Ruiqing, concurrently Director of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, giving a report. He explained that since liberation, the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, under the correct leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the active assistance of the broad masses of citizens, has adopted a policy of combining leniency and suppression, in accordance with Article 7 of the Common Program, "It is necessary to suppress all counter-revolutionary activities," and has severely suppressed counter-revolutionary activities by sentencing counter-revolutionaries to death, imprisonment, and control. Various reactionary secret service organizations have been basically crushed. However, counter-revolutionary activities have not been eradicated in Beijing. Some counter-revolutionaries have gone into hiding, while others have infiltrated from the outside, carrying out various conspiracies. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the work of suppression. Those who are still engaged in counter-revolutionary activities and are unrepentant must be severely suppressed. After Director Luo's report, committee members spoke one after another, unanimously agreeing that the suppression of counter-revolutionary elements should be strengthened. Committee member Xu Deheng said: I fully agree with and support Director Luo's report, because condoning one bad person will cause a series of unfortunate events in society. Committee member Fu Huating said: The business community fully supports Director Luo's report. The development of industry and commerce over the past year is inseparable from the stability of social order.

　　The meeting listened to and approved the report of Zhao Zishang, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, on the supplementary budget for the second half of the year's operating expenses, and decided to hold a farewell ceremony for the Chinese delegation attending the Second World Peace Congress before they departed the country. Finally, opinions were exchanged on the current situation. Chairman Peng Zhen gave a detailed analysis of the situation of the American imperialists expanding their war of aggression. Committee members spoke one after another, expressing their determination to support the government's policy, and that they could not ignore the American imperialist aggression against Korea and the violation of our country's Northeast airspace.

　　京市协商委员会举行九次会议
    决按期改选人民代表会议代表  讨论继续加强镇压反革命活动
    各委员发言决心支持政府反对美国侵略
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市各界人民代表会议协商委员会二十七日下午二时举行第九次会议，由彭真主席主持，出席委员三十人。
    会议首先讨论关于京市第三届各界人民代表会议代表的选举问题。第二届各界人民代表会议是在去年十一月二十日召开的，到现在将近一年。根据《京市第二届各界人民代表会议组织条例》第二条的规定：各界人民代表会议代表的任期，暂定为一年。因此，本届（第二届）代表会议代表的任期即将届满，下届（第三届）代表会议代表的产生问题须由协商委员会加以决定。经讨论结果，决定按期改选，并推定吴晗、刘仁、余心清、薛子正、李乐光、曹志麟、郭则沉、萧明、张致祥、张晓梅、古奇踪、李伯钊、董汝勤、崔月犁、傅华亭等十五人组成委员会，吴晗为主任委员，负责筹备工作，并提出具体办法交协商委员会通过。
    会议继而讨论关于镇压反革命活动问题，由京市人民政府公安局罗瑞卿兼局长作报告。他说明：解放以来，京市公安局在中共北京市委及市人民政府正确领导和广大市民积极协助下，根据共同纲领第七条“必须镇压一切反革命活动”的规定，采取宽大与镇压相结合的政策，对反革命分子以判处死刑、徒刑及管制等三种办法，严厉地镇压了反革命活动。各种反动特务组织基本上被打垮了。但是，反革命活动还没有在北京根绝。反革命分子有的隐蔽起来了，有的还从外面潜进来，进行各种阴谋活动。因此，必须继续加强镇压的工作。对于现在还进行反革命活动的怙恶不悛的分子，必须予以严厉镇压。罗兼局长报告之后，各委员相继发言，一致同意应加强对反革命分子的镇压。许德珩委员说：我完全同意与支持罗局长的报告，因为纵容一个坏人，就要使社会上发生一连串不幸事件。傅华亭委员说：工商界完全拥护罗局长的报告，工商业一年来的发展，与社会秩序的安定是分不开的。
    会议听取与通过市财政局赵子尚局长关于下半年事业费追加预算的报告，并决定定期欢送出席第二届保卫世界和平大会的中国代表团出国。最后对目前时局问题交换意见，彭真主席对美帝扩大侵略战争的形势曾作了详细的分析。各委员相继发言，纷纷表示决心支持政府的政策，对美帝侵略朝鲜与侵犯我国的东北领空，不能置之不理。
