　　Employees of the Linjiang Locomotive Depot
    Repair Damaged Locomotive Shot by Enemy, Counterattacking US Imperialist Aggression
    [This dispatch] According to the Jilin Daily: The "冖丂—" No. 928 locomotive, which was severely damaged by US imperialist aircraft strafing at Linjiang Station on August 27th, was completely repaired on October 1st. According to the extent of the damage to the locomotive, it should have been sent back to the railway factory for repair; however, all the workers of the Linjiang Locomotive Depot, in order to counter the provocations of US imperialism with practical actions, insisted on repairing it at the depot. After the workers' enthusiastic labor, the locomotive was repaired on October 1st and restored to the "all complete" standard. As soon as the locomotive was repaired, it was driven by the workers to the place where it was attacked to demonstrate the strength of the Chinese working class and the determination to oppose US imperialist aggression. This locomotive is now bravely running on the people's railway again.
