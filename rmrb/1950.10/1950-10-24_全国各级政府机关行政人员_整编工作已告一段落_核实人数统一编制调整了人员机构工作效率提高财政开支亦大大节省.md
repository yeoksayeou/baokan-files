Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch: The streamlining of administrative personnel in government agencies at all levels nationwide is nearing completion. In this work, government agencies at all levels have initially verified the number of personnel, unified staffing, and adjusted personnel structures. According to recent statistics, the number of administrative personnel in government agencies at all levels nationwide has decreased by approximately one-quarter compared to the figures estimated during the National Financial Conference in February of this year, resulting in a significant reduction in financial expenditure. This is one of the major achievements of this streamlining effort. Secondly, through this streamlining, the staffing of personnel in government agencies at all levels nationwide has been initially unified, thereby fundamentally halting the past phenomena of arbitrary expansion of institutions, increased cadres, and the opening of training classes in various localities. Thirdly, through this streamlining, various localities have merged institutions and adjusted cadres based on actual work needs. For example, Shandong Province abolished three administrative offices, six special districts, and four county governments; Hebei Province abolished one county government and five hundred and sixty-eight district governments. Personnel from the abolished organs have been supplemented to areas lacking cadres, thereby overcoming the unreasonable phenomena of overstaffing in some organs and understaffing in others, improving work efficiency, and enriching the cadre allocation of financial, enterprise departments, and district and township grassroots organizations.

Among the surplus personnel from the streamlining in various localities, some of the elderly and weak, as well as those who voluntarily returned home to engage in production, have been arranged to return to their hometowns for production or to relocate for recuperation; other personnel have been handled as follows: First, some have been assigned to work in financial and enterprise departments. Second, surplus personnel in newly liberated areas are undergoing training in preparation for participating in the land reform movement this winter. Third, worker and peasant cadres with lower levels of education are being enrolled in schools. Fourth, other personnel have been concentrated for study, awaiting unified allocation. Taking the five provinces of North China as an example: among the surplus personnel, apart from 460 people who have not yet been assigned work, 714 people have retired for recuperation, 4,589 people have been transferred to local cooperatives, tax bureaus, and industrial and mining enterprise departments, and 4,659 people have been enrolled in worker-peasant middle schools and primary schools for study.

During the streamlining process, some departments did not fully proceed from reality and were unwilling to retain female comrades with children and worker and peasant cadres with lower levels of education; in some individual areas, mobilization and persuasion were not carried out before the streamlining, and the work was carried out solely through administrative orders, which affected the work morale of cadres.

These deviations have been corrected whenever they have been promptly discovered.

　　全国各级政府机关行政人员
    整编工作已告一段落
    核实人数统一编制调整了人员机构工作效率提高财政开支亦大大节省
    【新华社二十一日讯】全国各级政府机关行政人员整编工作现已告一段落。在工作中各级政府机关初步核实了人数，统一了编制，并调整了人员机构。据最近统计：全国各级政府机关行政人员比今年二月全国财政会议时估计的数字减少约四分之一左右，因而大大地节省了财政开支。这是此次整编工作中的重大收获之一。其次，通过这次整编，全国各级政府机关人员的编制已初步统一，因而过去各地任意扩充机构、增加干部、开设训练班的现象已基本上停止。第三，通过这次整编，各地都根据实际工作需要裁并了机构，调整了干部。如山东省共撤销了三个行署、六个专署、四个县政府；河北省撤销了一个县政府和五百六十八个区政府。被裁机关的人员已补充到缺乏干部的地方去，因而克服了某些机关中人浮于事和另一些机关的事浮于人的不合理现象，提高了工作效率，并且充实了财政、企业部门和区、乡基层组织的干部配备。
    各地的编余人员中，一部分老弱的及自愿回家生产的，已安置他们回乡生产或移地休养；其他人员则已作如下的处理：一、一部分已分配到财政企业部门工作。二、新区编余人员一部分进行学习，准备今冬参加土地改革运动。三、文化水平较低的工农干部安置入学。四、其他人员已集中学习，等待统一调配。以华北五省为例：编余人员中除四百六十人尚未分配工作外，离职休养者七百一十四人，调到各地合作社、税务局、工矿企业部门者四千五百八十九人，入工农中学及小学学习者四千六百五十九人。
    在整编过程中，有些部门不完全从实际出发，不愿留用有孩子的女同志及文化水平较低的工农干部；也有个别地区在整编前不进行动员说服，单纯用行政命令来进行这个工作，以致影响干部的工作情绪。
    这些偏向凡及时发现者均已纠正。
