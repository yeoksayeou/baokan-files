    A Strict Reward and Punishment System Should Be Established
    Letter of Suggestion from Bai Ren of Qixin Cement Factory to the Editor:
    In state-owned and public factories, workers who create new records and improve output quality can receive certain rewards. However, in private factories, workers who create new records are not given appropriate rewards. I think this is wrong.
    In our Qixin Repair Shop, vice department, there is a master worker named Li Ende who created a method for rolling ore car chain plates on July 28 (for details, please refer to the Tangshan Labor Daily on August 3). Previously, it was operated manually, and three people could only roll ten pieces per day. Now, after using the machine, three people can roll 1,200 pieces per day. In the past, every 100 pieces rolled required two broken swages (tools), and more than 400 pieces required eight swages, using four kilograms of steel and five man-days for making the swages (blacksmithing, vice work, lathe, planer). Now, not a single swage has been broken, saving five workers and four kilograms of steel, and the quality has been improved to 100%, from inaccurate to very accurate. According to current results, 2043.5 jin of millet has been saved.
    When this amazing news spread, the factory director and Mr. Yang, the director of the repair shop, also went to see it in person, but so far the factory has not expressed any attitude towards the inventor, and the trade union has not paid any attention to it.
    However, on the 15th of this month, we saw a notice from the factory stating: On October 8, worker Zhai Shuxiang of the Second Team poured oil at the coal hopper location in Ding Kiln of Factory C, and was absent from his post without permission. Failure to pour oil on time damaged a set of 70mm copper tiles, affecting production. He was given a major demerit and fined three days' wages. Also, on October 11, team leader Wu Yunshan of the Fourth Team was demoted and his salary reduced due to a train collision caused by failure to switch the track. Worker Xu Qingtai was also fined three days' wages and given a major demerit for failing to switch the track. The formulation of these punishment systems has not been discussed by the workers, and we are not sure if the trade union is aware of them. The factory's purpose in formulating a punishment system is to improve production. We agree with this point. However, those who have made contributions and achievements, and who have contributed to production, should also be rewarded or commended in a timely manner. Only in this way can rewards and punishments be clearly distinguished. I hope relevant departments pay attention to this issue.

### 应建立严格的奖惩制度  启新洋灰厂白韧来信建议

    应建立严格的奖惩制度
    启新洋灰厂白韧来信建议编辑同志：
    在国营、公营工厂中，创造了新纪录，提高了产量质量的工人，都能受到一定的奖励。但在私营工厂中对创造新纪录的工人，并没有给予适当的奖励。我以为这是不对的。
    我们启新修机厂虎钳部有位李恩德老师傅，在七月二十八日创造了轧提运斗子链子板的方法（详细情况，请参阅八月三日的唐山劳动日报）：从前是用人力操纵的，每天三个人只能轧十片。现在改用机器后每天三个人可以轧一千二百片。从前每轧一百片需要坏两个铳头（工具），四百多片需八个铳头，用钢料四公斤，做铳头的人工五个（打铁、虎钳、车床、刨床）。现在一个铳头也没坏，省了五个工，四公斤钢料，质量提高到百分之百，由不准确做到十分准确。据现有成绩，已节省小米二千零四十三斤半。
    当这个惊人的消息传出后，厂长、修机厂的主任杨先生也亲自去看过，可是到现在厂方对发明者仍不表示态度，工会也不闻不问。
    可是在本月十五日，我们看见了厂方的通知单上说：二牌工友翟树香十月八日在丙厂丁窑干煤斗子地点浇油，擅离职守，未按时浇油碾坏七十米喱铜瓦一付，影响了生产，记大过一次，罚三日工资。又四牌工头吴云山在十月十一日因未搬道岔子发生撞车事件，受到撤职减薪的处分。工友许庆太也因未搬道岔子罚三日的工资，记大过一次。这些惩罚制度的规定，并未经过工友们讨论，工会是不是知道，我们就不清楚了。厂方制订惩罚制度，目的是为了搞好生产。我们同意这一点。但是对有功劳的，有成绩的，对生产有供献的，也应及时的予以奖励或表扬。这样才能做到赏罚分明。我希望有关部门注意这个问题。
