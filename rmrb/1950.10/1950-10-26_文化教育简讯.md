　　The "Exhibition of Historical Materials on the Guangdong People's Revolution Over the Past Century," jointly organized by the Guangzhou Provincial Library and a certain corps of the People's Liberation Army, opened on the anniversary of the liberation of Guangzhou (October 14th). The exhibition used pictures, charts, and objects to express the Guangdong people's struggles from the Opium War, through the two revolutionary periods of old democracy and new democracy, to liberation over the past century. The venue displayed the portraits of Comrade Su Guangzheng, who led the 1922 Seamen's Strike, and Comrade Peng Pai, who led the peasant struggles in Haifeng and Lufeng, and a special room was set up to exhibit the struggle materials of Haifeng, Lufeng, Dongjiang, and Qiongya during the three periods of the Land Revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation.
　　The geology department internship group of National Northwest University excavated a large number of ancient biological fossils and human implements in Liangshan, about twenty li west of Nanzheng City, Shaanxi Province, in mid-August. Of value were two huge orthoconic nautiloids among the biological fossils, which are fossils of cephalopods (animals that walk with their head and feet together, which have long been extinct) from at least 300 million years ago. In addition, there were various complete trilobite (a type of arthropod) fossils and twelve stone axes, stone knives, stone arrows, and other tools used by humans in the Neolithic and Paleolithic ages.
　　The Logistics Department of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army discovered more than 2,000 precious cultural relics while constructing warehouses in the Luoyang area of Henan Province. Among them are bronze ware from the Warring States period to the Han Dynasty, such as tripods, pots, ?, yi, cups, swords, spears, horses, jade ware, agate ware, and production tools, such as stone axes, bronze axes, iron axes, iron plows, etc., as well as dozens of types of pottery such as li, ding, bells, pots, bottles, and bowls from the Han Dynasty. In addition to a portion of the cultural relics being taken by the Cultural Relics Bureau of the Central Ministry of Culture and transported to Beijing, the remainder were received by the Cultural Department of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee.
