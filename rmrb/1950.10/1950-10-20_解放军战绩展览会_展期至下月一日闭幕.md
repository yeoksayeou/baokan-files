    Exhibition of PLA Achievements Extended to Close on November 1st
    Since its opening at the Palace Museum on October 1st, the Exhibition of Achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has been very popular among all sectors of society, with a constant stream of visitors every day. The exhibition was originally scheduled to close on October 16th, but due to numerous requests from visitors for an extension, and with the registration of organizations and groups for visits already scheduled until October 25th, the decision has been made to extend the exhibition until November 1st in order to ensure that the broad masses have the opportunity to visit. The visiting hours remain the same (organizations and groups can visit from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM daily, and the general public can visit freely from 12:00 PM to 5:00 PM).

    解放军战绩展览会
    展期至下月一日闭幕
    中国人民解放军战绩展览会自本月一日在故宫博物馆揭幕以来，很受各界欢迎，每日前往参观者络绎不绝。该会原定本月十六日闭幕，但因许多观众纷纷要求展期，并且进行登记参观的机关团体已排至二十五日，为了照顾广大群众都能得到参观机会，决定展期至十一月一日闭幕。参观时间仍照旧（每日上午九时至十二时为机关团体参观，十二时至下午五时为市民自由参观）。
