　　Resolutely Liberate the Unliberated Territory, Defend Our Victorious Achievements!
    Combat Hero of the Northeast Military Region, Ma Chunyu
    I participated in the National Conference of Combat Heroes, saw our beloved Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, as well as all the leaders, and also saw the heroes from all over the country. Chairman Mao even hosted a banquet for us. This is a rare and great happy event in a lifetime. This is the glory of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the glory of the Communist Party and the people of the whole country!
    Only when the people of the whole country are united under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu can the working masses have today's happy life.
    Now it is our joyous National Day again. Last year, this day brought us happiness. The suffering people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, turned over and became masters, and established their own people's government. We should be extremely excited and celebrate this lovely day in our actual work. I guarantee to bring back the valuable things from this conference of model heroes to the army, to convey them to the hearts of every comrade, so as to strive to build a strong national defense force. We must recognize the enemy: the guns and bullets of American imperialism have killed countless revolutionary martyrs of the Chinese people, owing us blood debts, and also want to invade our Taiwan and massacre our compatriots in Andong. We can no longer be lenient with it. We must avenge the blood debt and make it get out of Taiwan and Korea! This is the responsibility that our revolutionary soldiers should fulfill. We are determined to liberate the unliberated territory of the motherland, defend our victorious achievements, and build the country that Chairman Mao has established for us.

　　坚决解放没有解放的国土，  保卫我们胜利的果实！
    东北军区战斗英雄  马春雨
    我参加了全国战斗英雄代表会议，看见了自己亲爱的毛主席和朱总司令及各位首长，又看见了全国的英雄们。毛主席还设宴招待我们。这是一件一生难得的大喜事。这是毛主席和朱总司令的光荣，共产党和全国人民的光荣！
    只有全国人民团结在毛主席、朱总司令的英明领导下，劳苦大众才有了今天幸福的日子。
    现在又是咱们可喜的国庆了。去年这个日子，给咱们带来了幸福，苦难的人民在毛主席领导下翻过身来，当了主人，成立了自己的人民政府。我们应当万分兴奋，在实际工作中来庆祝这个可爱的日子。我保证将这次英模代表会议宝贵的东西，带回部队去，传达到每个同志的心里，好为建设强大的国防军而奋斗。我们要认准了敌人：美帝国主义的枪炮子弹，杀害了不知多少中国人民革命的先烈，欠下了我们的血债，还要侵略我们的台湾，扫杀我安东的同胞。我们再不能宽大它我们要报血仇，要叫它滚出台湾、朝鲜去！这是我们革命军人应尽的责任。我们坚决要解放祖国还没有解放的国土，保卫我们胜利的果实，建设好毛主席给打下的江山。
