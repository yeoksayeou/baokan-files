　　On the Declaration Issued by Chinese Christian Community
    Zhao Zichen
    A few days ago, the Christian community issued a declaration explaining the path of Chinese Christianity's efforts in the new China. This document is of historical value. First, the people who signed their names are mostly Christian leaders, all of whom have followers within the church. Although only a little over a thousand people signed, these people represent nearly a million people behind them. Therefore, this document is important. Now, various places are continuing to solicit signatures from believers. Second, Chinese Christians are patriotic and wholeheartedly support the government, so the title is "The Path of Efforts in the Construction of New China." Third, Chinese Christianity, standing on the position of its own faith, opposes imperialism, especially the imperialism led by the United States. What is sought is a righteous peace in the world. If unfortunately there is a war in the future, I dare to believe that Chinese Christianity, like the Orthodox Church in the Soviet Union during the Second World War, will absolutely not be shaken by external inducements, and will completely stand on the same line as its own regime and strive to overcome difficulties. Fourth, now that Christianity has clearly stated its attitude, their churches will naturally strive to achieve self-support and self-reliance. This is a most arduous task, so it is said that they must "achieve the goal of self-reliance in the shortest possible time." Although Christianity in China has many shortcomings, it has gained a deep understanding and sympathy from society due to its consistent service. The issued declaration will certainly attract the attention of people from all walks of life. I deeply hope that this determination will contribute to the great unity of the Chinese people and be a major blow to foreign delusions of using religion. Jesus said, "No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God." Christianity today only has the road of progress ahead.

　　论中国基督教界所发表的宣言
    赵紫宸
    前几日基督教界发表了一个宣言，说明中国基督教在新中国努力的途径。这个文件是有历史价值的。第一、具名的人大都是基督教的领袖，都是有教中的群众的。虽然签名的不过一千余人，这些人背后却有近百万人。所以这个文件是有重要性的。现在各处地方正在络续征求信徒们签名。第二、中国基督徒是爱国的，是全心拥护政府的，所以标题是新中国建设中努力的途径。第三、中国基督教站在自己信仰的立场上是反对帝国主义的，尤其是美国所领导的帝国主义。所求的是世界正谊的和平。万一将来不幸而有战争，我敢信中国的基督教与苏联在世界第二次大战时的东正教一样，是绝对不受外诱的摇动的，是完全与自己的政权站在一条线上努力去克服困难的。第四、基督教既已明白地表明了态度，他们的教会自然要努力去谋求自养自立。这是一件最艰苦的事情，所以说要“在最短期内实现自力更生的目标。”基督教在中国虽然有不少缺点，然而因其素来的服务也已得了社会上深切的了解与同情。所发表的宣言，当然会引起各界人民的注意。我深望这一次的决心，对于中国人民的大团结是有贡献的，对于外国妄想利用宗教的痴梦，是一个重大的打击。耶稣说：“手扶犁头，不容回顾。”基督教今日也只有前进的道路了。
