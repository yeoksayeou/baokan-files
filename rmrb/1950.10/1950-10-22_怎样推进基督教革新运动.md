How to Promote the Christian Reformation Movement
　　Wu Yaozong

The declaration of Christianity, "The Path of Chinese Christianity's Efforts in the Construction of New China," was published in the People's Daily in Beijing on September 23, and subsequently in newspapers across the country. The first batch of signatures numbered 1,527, the second batch 1,741; the third batch of signatures is being sent in successively, and has exceeded 2,000 within half a month. This signature campaign is developing vigorously. Many places are asking us to send large batches of signature forms in order to solicit signatures widely. We estimate that by the end of this year, the number of signatures will exceed 10,000; this will include most of the responsible people in Chinese Christianity nationwide, and a considerable number of grassroots believers. This is a major event in the more than 100 years since Christianity was introduced to China. In the future, Christianity will develop in a new direction, gradually realizing the goals of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation, and striving for the construction of New China.

In the process of the signature campaign, we have discovered several issues that are of most concern to everyone. If we want to steadily advance the Christian Reformation Movement, we must pay close attention to these issues.

The first issue is the specific methods for achieving the goals of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation. Many churches in China have already completely embarked on the road of self-government and self-support, but many churches and their undertakings, such as schools, hospitals, and national or regional administrative organizations, still rely entirely or partially on foreign economic assistance. How these churches and organizations should streamline and economize, how to develop economic sources, and how to adapt their work plans and economic needs to the environment of New China—these issues should be studied in detail and properly resolved by Christian figures. Fortunately, everyone has now begun to think about these issues. We believe that as long as we can fully develop the self-respect and self-confidence of believers, and their spirit of patriotism and love for democracy, these problems will be satisfactorily resolved within a not-too-long period.

Secondly, there is the issue of eliminating the forces and influence of imperialism within Christianity. Many Christians do not have a clear understanding of this issue. Some people still harbor illusions about imperialism, especially American imperialism; some people believe that besides "white" imperialism, there is also "red" imperialism; and some people do not recognize that there are imperialist forces and influences within Christianity, or do not admit that they themselves have anything to do with this force and influence. These situations indicate that Christianity must conduct a long-term anti-imperialist, anti-feudalist, and anti-bureaucratic-capitalist education for its believers.

Thirdly, some Christians have concerns about the future of Christianity in New China. They doubt whether the principle of religious freedom in the Common Program can be fully realized; they are also concerned about whether Christianity can permanently retain its legal status in the social development of New China. These problems are not easy to be thoroughly resolved to the satisfaction of some believers, because they are not only political issues, but also ideological issues and faith issues. But we can at least affirm and firmly point out that the principle of religious freedom, under the condition of not violating the interests of the people, will definitely be fully realized in the stage of New Democracy and even in the stage of socialism, and there is no doubt about this. As for whether Christianity can exist permanently, it depends on whether Christianity can play the role it should play in society. If Christianity cannot play these roles, even if it is given a legal guarantee, it will eliminate itself. Conversely, if Christianity contributes to the people, if Christianity can progress with the progress of the times, Christianity will not only be able to exist, but will also be valued. As to whether Christianity can, or should, permanently preserve its current form and ideological framework, that is a matter of historical evolution, and not only can outsiders not answer it for us, but we ourselves cannot make any affirmative predictions about it.

The Christian Reformation Movement will inevitably develop, because this movement is a link in the entire Chinese revolutionary movement. We sincerely look forward to the success of this Reformation Movement.

　　怎样推进基督教革新运动
    吴耀宗
    基督教的宣言《中国基督教在新中国建设中努力的途径》于九月二十三日在北京人民日报发表了，随后在全国的报纸也发表了。第一批签名一五二七人，第二批一七四一人；第三批签名正在陆续寄到，在半个月之内已超过两千人。这个签名运动，正在蓬勃地发展，许多地方要我们把签名单大批地寄去，以便广泛征求签名。我们估计在今年年底，签名人数将超过一万；这就把全国基督教大部分的负责人士，和一个相当数目的基层群众都包括在里面。这是基督教传到中国以后一百多年来的一件大事。今后的基督教，将朝着一个新的方向发展，逐步地实现自治、自养、自传的目标，为新中国的建设而努力。
    在签名运动的进行中，我们发见了几个为大家所最关心的问题。如果我们要把基督教革新运动稳步地推进，我们就必须对这几个问题加以深切的注意。
    第一个问题是实现自治、自养、自传的目标的具体办法。国内有不少的教会已经完全走上自治、自养的道路，但有许多教会和他们所办的事业，如学校、医院等，及全国性的或区域性的行政机构，还是全部地或部分地依靠国外的经济援助的。这些教会和机构，应当怎样地精简节约，怎样地开辟经济来源，怎样地使它们工作的计划和经济的需要适应新中国的环境——这些问题都应当由基督教人士加以详细的研究和妥善的解决。很可庆幸的，现在大家已经开始为这些问题用思想了。我们相信，只要我们能充分地发挥信徒们自尊自信的心理，和爱国爱民主的精神，这些问题，在一个不会太长的时期内，都会获得满意的解决。
    其次，是肃清帝国主义在基督教里面的力量与影响的问题。对这个问题，还有不少的基督徒没有得到清楚的了解。有些人对帝国主义，尤其是美帝国主义，还抱着幻想；有些人认为除了“白色”的帝国主义以外，还有“赤色”的帝国主义：也有些人不承认基督教里面有帝国主义的力量与影响，或不承认他们自己与这个力量与影响有什么关系。这些情况都表示着基督教对它的信徒群众，必须进行一个长期的，反帝国主义、反封建主义、反官僚资本主义的教育。
    再其次，是一些基督徒对基督教在新中国的前途的顾虑。他们怀疑共同纲领中宗教信仰自由的原则，是否可以完全实现；他们也顾虑到在新中国的社会发展中，基督教是否能够永久地保留着它的合法地位。这些问题是不容易得到若干信徒所要求的彻底的解决的，因为它们不只是政治上的问题，同时也是思想上的问题，信仰上的问题。但我们至少可以肯定地、坚决地指出：宗教信仰自由的原则，在不违反人民利益的条件下，在新民主主义的阶段中，以至在社会主义的阶段中，必定能够完全实现，这是毫无疑问的。至于基督教是否能够永久存在，那就要看基督教能否在社会里发生它所应当发生的作用。如果基督教不能发生这些作用，即使在法律上给它一个保障，它自己也是会消灭的。相反地，如果基督教对人民有贡献，如果基督教能够随着时代的进展而进展，基督教就不只能够存在，并且会被人重视。至于基督教是否可以，或应当，永久保存着它现在的形式，和思想的范畴，那就是一个历史演变的问题，不但教外的人不能替我们回答，就是我们自己也不能对它做什么肯定的预言。
    基督教革新运动，是必将发展下去的，因为这个运动是整个中国革命运动的一环。我们谨以至诚期望着这个革新运动的成功。
