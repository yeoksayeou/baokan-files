    虽然电站部执行计划稍有不足，但整个说来第三季国民经济发电量计划，包括各工业部的发电厂在内，已被超过了。
    二、重要工业产量的增加
    一九五○年第三季最重要工业产品的生产量与一九四九年第三季相较，其变化如下（一九五○年第三季对一九四九年第三季的百分比）：

    最先进技术方法的采用、生产方法的更臻完善，以及物资耗损的减低，保证了一九五○年第三季许多工业部门每一生产单位中进一步减少原料、物资、燃料与电力的消耗。
    第三季所定的减低工业生产成本的目标完成而且超过了。一九五○年第三季，工业生产成本与物价相比，下降了百分之七。
    三、农业
    集体农场、机器拖拉机站与国家农场正在胜利完成谷物与工业农作物的收藏工作。
    根据苏联部长会议所属谷物收获量中央调查委员会供给的材料，虽然在北高加索的一部分地区以及本国其他某些地区今年雨水失调，但今年谷物收获量仍不减去年。
    今年棉花的收成大大地超过去年。甜菜收成也比去年好。其他工业作物与马铃薯的收成也很令人满意。
    今年短期内即已完成了冬季作物的播种工作。到十月十五日为止，比去年同日多播种了二百三十万公顷冬季作物。
