　　Inspection of Streamlining and Thrift Work Achieves Improvements

　　[This newspaper reported] In the Central People's Government Intelligence Administration's streamlining and thrift inspection work, leading cadres personally took charge of conducting inspections, promoting democracy, and展开 criticism and self-criticism. They discovered several problems existing within the organization and many unwarranted wasteful phenomena. The leadership reviewed certain irresponsible and uninformed bureaucratic work styles. This inspection helped the leadership, educated the cadres, and stimulated the working enthusiasm of the masses. Therefore, it not only exposed past problems and put forward suggestions for future improvements, but also immediately implemented the spirit of streamlining and thrift into practical work.

　　In terms of expenditure, various rules and regulations were first established, such as the "Provisional Accounting Measures," "Budget System for the Storage and Issuance of Materials," and "Registration and Management Measures." Actual improvements were significant. For example, the expenditure on office supplies for each unit in July was over 3 million yuan, which was reduced to over 900,000 yuan in August.

　　Regarding staffing, some comrades corrected the view that the main problem was insufficient manpower, rather than wasted manpower, making everyone realize that the main problem of the Intelligence Administration was not too few cadres, but rather the division of labor and working relationships between the work tasks and various departments and offices were not clear enough. Although the total number of people was not large, some units did not lack personnel. Regarding the division of labor and responsibilities of each department, research was conducted based on specific circumstances, and partial adjustments were made. For example, the General Office reduced its original staffing by 43 people. The entire administration reduced a total of 96 people. In terms of work systems, such as office and meeting systems, improved methods were formulated after research, and detailed rules for administrative staff were formulated, as well as systems for regular work inspections, leave, rewards and punishments. Regarding work attitude, there has also been significant progress after this inspection. For example, some cadres who were unwilling to do administrative work in the past have corrected this erroneous understanding after this inspection, and are determined to do a good job in administrative work.

　　In order to consolidate the achievements and continue to implement the spirit of streamlining and thrift, it was decided to establish an organization-wide financial expenditure inspection committee and an organizational structure for inspecting business operations, so that streamlining and thrift inspection would become a regular system.

    检查精简节约工作获得改进
    【本报讯】中央人民政府情报总署在精简节约检查工作中，首长亲自负责进行检查，发扬民主，展开批评和自我批评，发现机关内所存在着的若干问题，及许多不应有的浪费现象。领导上对某些不负责任及不了解情况的官僚主义作风进行了检讨。经过这次检查，帮助了领导，教育了干部，发挥了群众的工作积极性，因此，不但揭露了过去的问题，提出了今后改进的意见，并且立即将精简节约的精神贯彻到实际工作中去。
    在经费开支方面，首先是订立了各种规章、制度。如“会计暂行办法”、“保管发物预算制度”登记与管理办法”等。实际有了显著的改进，如七月份各单位办公用品开支三百多万元，八月份减至九十多万元。
    在人员编制方面，纠正了一些同志认为主要的问题是人力不够，而不是人力浪费的问题，使大家认识到：情报总署主要的问题，不是干部过少，而是工作任务及各处、室之间的分工及工作关系尚不够明确的问题。总的人数虽不多，但有的单位却并不缺人。关于各部门的分工及职掌问题，根据具体情况，进行了研究，做了局部的调整，如办公厅按原编制减少了四十三人。全署合计共缩减九十六人。在工作制度上，如办公、会议等制度，经过研究，都订出了改进的办法，并制订了事务人员工作细则，制订了定期检查工作及请假与奖惩等制度。关于工作态度，经过这次检查，也有了显著的进步，如有的干部，过去不愿意做行政工作，经过此次检查以后，大部分同志都纠正了这种错误的认识，决心做好行政工作。
    为了巩固既得成绩，继续贯彻精简节约的精神，决定成立全署的财政开支检查委员会，及检查业务工作的组织机构，使精简节约检查成为一个经常的制度。
