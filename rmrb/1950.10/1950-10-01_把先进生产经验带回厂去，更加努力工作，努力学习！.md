　　Bring Advanced Production Experience Back to the Factory, Work Harder and Study Harder!
　　East China Industrial Labor Model Ruǎn Kāilì
　　I am a technician at the Shanghai Second Steel Plant. In the past, I couldn't have imagined how a working-class person like me could turn things around. In the early days of Shanghai's liberation, I heard everyone say that Chairman Mao told us that to build a new China, we must develop production and prosper the economy. Our country can only be built well if our steel industry develops. At the beginning of March, the Ministry of Industry gave us our first task. Because I thought about how in the past, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, our lives were unsustainable, but now our lives are better, how could we not work hard to produce? So I worked with my fellow workers every day to find ways to improve production. Later, the Ministry of Industry assigned us a new production task to welcome Red May, which was much higher than the last one, and I actively looked for ways to improve production. After thinking it over, I came up with a way to improve production tools and allocate productivity, and as a result, I completed the task ahead of schedule and above the quota. At that time, my main idea was to build the country and improve our lives. I never thought I would become a labor model, come to our people's capital for a meeting, and be able to see our people's leaders Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. They also spoke to us, treated us to wine, and showed us movies. In the future, I will definitely guarantee the completion of all tasks and unite the workers to take the lead. This time, I also learned a lot of valuable experience from many advanced workers. I must bring the experience shared by the representatives back to our factory, work harder, and study harder. Only in this way can I be worthy of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, all the leaders, and all the advanced workers.

　　把先进生产经验带回厂去，更加努力工作，努力学习！
    华东工业劳动模范  阮开利
    我是上海钢铁第二厂的一个技术工人。在过去的时候，我想不到我们一个劳苦工人还有怎样的翻身。在上海解放初期，我听大家说毛主席告诉我们，要建设新中国，必须发展生产，繁荣经济。我们的国家，非得要我们钢铁工业发展了，才能建设好。三月初，工业部第一次交来任务。因为我想到过去在国民党反动统治时期，我们的生活根本不能维持，现在生活好了，还能不努力生产吗？所以我就每天与工友同志想办法。后来工业部又交来迎接红五月的新生产任务，比上次高了很多，我又积极想办法，提高生产。想来想去，我就想出了一个改进生产工具和调配生产力的办法，结果提早超额完成了任务。当时，我主要是想法建设国家，改善我们的生活，想不到要做劳模，到我们人民的首都来开会，又可以看见我们人民的领袖毛主席、朱总司令。他们还对我们讲话，又请我们吃酒，看电影。今后我一定要保证完成一切任务，要团结工人，起带头作用。这次我还学到不少先进工友同志们的许多宝贵经验，我一定要将各位代表讲的经验，带回我们厂去，更加努力工作，努力学习。这样，才对得住毛主席、朱总司令及各位首长以及各位先进工作者。
