Representatives of various fraternal ethnic groups in the Lijiang Special District traveled as far as 120 li to greet them.

Representatives of eight ethnic groups, including the Tibetan, Yi, Lisu, Nu, Mosuo, and Miao, and lamas from Zhongdian presented fresh flowers and hadas (a silk scarf regarded as a very precious gift by Tibetans) to the sub-delegation’s leaders, Xia Kangnong and Wang Lianfang, the head and deputy head of the delegation, as well as Zhang Chong, Vice Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial People's Government (of the Yi ethnic group), who accompanied them. People of all ethnic groups also performed various songs and dances, singing praises to Chairman Mao. When the visiting delegation entered Lijiang City, tens of thousands of people cheered along the streets and threw flowers. At the welcome meetings in various places, the visiting delegation conveyed in detail Chairman Mao's and the Central People's Government's concern for all fraternal ethnic groups and explained the ethnic policies in the Common Program. The visiting delegation's performing arts troupe also performed song and dance dramas and showed movies to comfort the fraternal ethnic groups.
