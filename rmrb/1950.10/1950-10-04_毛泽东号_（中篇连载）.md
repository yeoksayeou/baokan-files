Forty-one. Locomotives need to be cleaned every day, and so do people!

　　Around this time, it was almost May Day.

　　Around this time, the "May 1st Labor" locomotive was about to be repaired.

　　People studied the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, repairing a damaged locomotive: the rush repair started on April 12th; the people from the "Mao Zedong" locomotive who were off duty also took turns to help repair, and the family members of the "1939" locomotive crew also came to help repair…

　　The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang refused peace, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu called on railway workers to resolutely transport troops and ammunition to the south of the Yangtze River!

　　All the members of the "Mao Zedong" team jumped up and raised their fists:

　　"Work, resolutely work!"

　　"Challenge the Beijing locomotive! Challenge the Tianjin locomotive! Challenge the No. 1, 2, and 3 locomotives of Tangshan!"

　　"Challenge all typical locomotives!"

　　Also launched the "May 1st Labor" to challenge the "1939" locomotive! Challenge Shanhaiguan, challenge the Northeast!

　　Challenge! Challenge:

　　From May 1st to June 30th, complete 15,000 kilometers of safe running! Do daily minor repairs yourself! Keep the locomotive clean! Master Level B and C inspections in two months! Carry out criticism and self-criticism, the team should be as united as steel!...

　　Most locomotives in Fengtai were involved in the competition. But many drivers and stokers couldn't understand the ideas, they said:

　　"Challenge or not, it's all about driving and getting paid anyway, not stoking and going hungry!"

　　"Hey, don't seek merit, just avoid mistakes!"

　　"Is the Mao Zedong locomotive here to monitor us? Under the guise of helping..."

　　"Who cares, whoever comes, we just drive and eat!"

　　Some were lazy and slippery, only able to do less, not more;

　　Some attempted to conceal accidents;

　　Some colluded and shielded each other, some often had disagreements and were not united...

　　For all this, the old heroes carried out patient and sincere work—persuasion, explanation, education: talk once, talk twice, talk superficially, talk deeply, talk during meals and playtime, talk whenever there was an opportunity.

　　They also helped them hold group meetings, helping them learn self-criticism and criticism.

　　Zheng Dugong did the most outstanding job in this regard, he moved people with his own personal experience and understanding.

　　People changed one by one, quickly or slowly.

　　People said:

　　"This method will fix anyone!"

　　"You can't help but learn!"

　　"Chairman Mao really has a way!"

　　"Old Zheng is a good person!"

　　"Old Yue is not bad either!"...

　　People advanced one by one, and the work progressed step by step.

　　The face of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot changed day by day.

　　Washing locomotives, contracted operation, call and response, group meetings, all were universally established.

　　When the locomotive came back for cleaning and maintenance, people said again:

　　"This person is just like this locomotive; the locomotive needs to be cleaned every day, and people also need to be cleaned every day, the more the locomotive is cleaned, the more beautiful it becomes, the more people are cleaned, the more they progress... ..."

　　Old Zheng was particularly excited when he heard it, and said:

　　"Ha, not bad, Chairman Mao's words are used on our heads, we all have Mao Zedong Thought!"

　　People smiled happily and said:

　　"That's all thanks to your good help, Old Zheng, don't you think so?"

　　The two-month competition ended, and the "May 1st Labor" completed 15,000 kilometers of safe running six days ahead of schedule. Daily locomotive kilometers increased from 292.94 kilometers to 605.1 kilometers.

　　It was a rapid leap forward! It was an unprecedented achievement!

　　The "1939" locomotive was only slightly behind, and other locomotives followed closely.

Postscript: "This is really your great joy!"

　　This article is basically finished; a few things need to be briefly added:

　　On "May Day," from the Northeast to the interior, everyone celebrated for the "Mao Zedong" locomotive.

　　Guo Shude was elected as a representative to go to the Northeast General Bureau to attend the celebration conference, and the "Mao Zedong" locomotive was rated as a collective first-class merit by the Northeast Railway General Bureau, and the old hero Li Yong was awarded a personal first-class merit. Two award flags:

　　"130,000 kilometers of safe running!"

　　"A model for long-term accident-free operation and establishing a circular operation system."

　　And received a bonus of 30 million Northeast currency.

　　At the same time, in Fengtai, Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan personally participated in the celebration conference of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, gave a speech to encourage them, and called on everyone to learn from them! The female workers presented them with flowers.

　　In June, at the National Railway Locomotive Conference, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive was selected as the banner of national locomotives, and the driver chief Li Yong, the old hero, was promoted to section-chief-level driver.

　　At this time, the locomotive had reached the repair period and entered the Tangshan factory for intermediate repair. All the team members were dispersed to help with the work on the Fengtai section: Guo Shude did branch work, the old hero helped with operation, Shang Baoheng was promoted to guidance driver, Zheng Dugong, Yue Shangwu, Hu Chundong, Wang Qingquan, Zhu Dianji, and Zhao Haisheng were assigned to various locomotives and promoted to learning drivers and stokers.

　　Comrades Lao Shang and Lao Zheng, under the active cultivation of the branch and their urgent request, were honorably admitted to the Party through the introduction of Guo Shude. The old hero congratulated them and said:

　　"Joining the Party is really your great joy! Not joining the Party is like a wild horse, running around recklessly, no one to discipline you, and you will accidentally run into a wrong path. I still regret joining the Party too late..." (The End)

　　毛泽东号
    （中篇连载）
    丁克辛  轻影作
  四十一、机车天天要擦洗，人也一样！
    这时候，快到“五一”了。
    这时候，“五一劳动号”机车快修起来了。
    人们学习“毛泽东号”，把一台破损机车修复起来：四月十二号开始抢修；“毛泽东号”歇班的人也轮流帮着修，“一九三九号”机车人员的家属也来帮着修。……
    蒋介石匪帮拒绝和平，朱总司令号召铁路工人要坚决把军队、弹药运到江南去！
    “毛泽东号”全组人员跳起来，伸出拳头：
    “干，坚决干！”
    “跟北京号挑战！跟天津号挑战！跟唐山的一、二、三号机车挑战！”
    “跟所有的典型机车挑战！”
    又发动“五一劳动号”跟“一九三九号”挑战！跟山海关、东北挑战！
    挑战！挑战：
    五月一号到六月三十号，要完成一万五千公里安全走行！日常小修自己做！保持机车清洁！两个月学会乙丙检！开展检讨批评，小组团结如钢铁！……
    丰台多数机车卷入了竞赛。但也有不少司机司炉思想搞不通，他们说：
    “挑战不挑战，反正是开车拿钱，不烧火挨饿！”
    “嗨，不求有功，但求无过！”
    “毛泽东号莫非是监视咱们来了？借个帮助的名……”
    “管他哩，谁来也是开车吃饭！”
    有的是偷懒耍滑，只能少干不能多干；
    有的出了事故企图隐瞒不报；
    有的互相拉拢包庇，有的常闹意见不团结……
    对这一切，老英雄他们进行了耐心的恳切的工作——说服、解释、教育：一次谈，两次谈，浅谈，深谈，吃饭玩儿的时候谈，瞅着有机会就谈。
    又帮助他们开小组会，帮助他们学会检讨和批评。
    这些工作郑笃恭做得最出色，他用自己切身的经验和体会感动了人家。
    人们一个个或快或慢的转变了。
    人们说了：
    “这办法是人都得给治住！”
    “你诚心不想学好也不行！”
    “毛主席真有办法！”
    “老郑这人不错！”
    “老岳也不赖！”……
    人一个个前进，工作跟着一步步前进。
    丰台机务段的面貌一天比一天不同了。
    擦车，包乘，呼唤应答，小组会，一样样都普遍建立起来了。
    机车回来擦洗检修的时候，人们又说：
    “这人啊，就好比这机车；机车天天要擦洗，人也天天要擦洗，机车越擦洗越漂亮，人越擦洗越进步。………………”
    老郑听得特别兴奋，说：
    “哈，不错，把毛主席的话用到咱头上了，都有了毛泽东思想啦！”
    人们高兴地笑着说：
    “那全仗你们帮助得好啊，老郑你说是不是？”
    两个月竞赛结束，“五一劳动号”提前六天完成了一万五千公里安全走行。日车公里从二百九十二点九四公里，提高到六百零五点一公里。
    是飞快的跃进！是从来未有的成绩！
    “一九三九号”差的有限，别的机车也紧紧跟着。
  追记：“真是你们的大喜呀！”
    本篇大体上写完了；有几件事需要简单追记一下：
    “五一”那天，从东北到关内，都为“毛泽东号”庆贺。
    郭树德当选代表到东北总局去开庆功大会，“毛泽东号”被东北铁路总局评为集体一大功，老英雄李永个人一大功。得奖旗两面：
    “安全走行十三万公里！”
    “长期无事故，建立循环运转制的模范。”
    并获得奖金东北币三千万元。
    同时在丰台，铁道部滕代远部长亲自参加了“毛泽东号”的庆功大会，讲话鼓励了她们，并号召大家向他们学习看齐！女工们给他们献花。
    六月里，在全国铁路机务会议上，“毛泽东号”被选为全国机车的旗帜，司机长李永老英雄提升为段长级司机。
    就在这时，机车已到修理时期，入唐山工厂进行中修了。全组人员分散帮助丰台段上工作：郭树德做支部工作，老英雄帮助运转，商宝恒升了指导司机，郑笃恭、岳尚武、胡春东和王清权、朱殿吉、赵海盛分到各个机车上，升任学习司机和司炉。
    老商和老郑两个同志，在支部积极培养和他们迫切要求下，经过郭树德介绍，都光荣的入了党。老英雄给他们庆贺时说道：
    “入了党真是你们的大喜呀！不入党就好比一匹野马，任着性子乱跑没人管教，一不小心就跑到斜岔上去了，我还后悔入党太晚……”（完）
