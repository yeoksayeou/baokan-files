　　Place Ideological Emphasis on Grammar
    Dong Xin
    Two months ago, the People's Daily published a short commentary calling on everyone to pay attention to grammar. Following that, the bi-weekly "News Work" successively published articles by Mr. Ye Shengtao, using the People's Daily as an example to illustrate some grammatical errors in the text. However, up to now, the issue of grammar does not seem to have aroused the general attention and importance of our journalists. Some grammatical and rhetorical problems still appear more or less in some of our news reports.
    We seem to have such a bias: When writing and editing稿, reporters and editors often only pay attention to the grasp of policy principles, while ignoring the problems of the text. They believe that as long as a manuscript can correctly grasp the policy principles in content, it is a good manuscript, and the problems of the text are very secondary. Some people even regard grammar as a trivial matter, insignificant, and think that paying attention to grammar is a technical point of view. As long as there are no policy or principle errors in a news稿, it is considered "superior" and completely passed, without seriously paying attention to the problems in the text. I think this is the most fundamental reason why grammatical errors often occur in our newspaper news.
    The grasp of policy and principles is naturally absolutely necessary; because this is the soul of a news manuscript, without them, it cannot correctly guide practical work and play its due combat role. However, it is also wrong to relax, ignore, or even disregard the role of words as a result. The tool we rely on to directly convey policies and guide work is text. If we completely ignore the role of text, then any correct policy will have no way to convey, and any specific work will not be guided. No matter how good your news content is, and how strong its guidance is, if the text you rely on to express it is not smooth enough, and the wording is not appropriate enough, and people can't understand it, it will definitely not get the due publicity effect. Not only that, in some cases, it will affect the authenticity of the news, weaken the guidance and combat effectiveness of the news; and even cause a backlash, which is inevitable to be exploited by the enemy.
    Therefore, we can say with certainty that the grasp of policy principles and the grasp of writing techniques should not be neglected. It is certainly wrong to only pay attention to writing techniques and ignore the grasp of policy principles. It is also a bias to only grasp policy principles and ignore writing techniques.
    Our requirement for an armed revolutionary fighter is not only to have a high degree of political awareness, revolutionary spirit, etc., but also to have skilled combat techniques and be good at mastering and using weapons. Our requirements for journalists are also the same.
    I hope that every one of our journalists will attach importance to grammar from an ideological point of view.

### 从思想上重视文法

　　从思想上重视文法
    冬信
    两月前，人民日报曾经发表了一篇短评，号召大家注意文法；接着《新闻工作》两周刊又陆续发表了叶圣陶先生的文章，以人民日报为例，说明了若干文字中文法上的错误。但直到现在为止，文法问题似乎还没有能够引起我们新闻工作者的普遍注意和重视，文法上和修辞上的一些问题，在我们的若干新闻报道中还依然或多或少的出现。
    我们似乎是存在着这样一种偏向：记者和编辑在写稿和编稿时，往往只注意了政策性原则性的掌握，而忽略了文字问题。他们认为一篇稿子只要内容上能正确掌握了政策原则，这便是一篇好稿子，文字上的问题是非常次要的。有的人甚至把文法问题看成是文字末节，毫不足道，认为讲求文法是技术观点。一篇新闻稿子里只要没有政策性原则性的错误，便算是“上乘”，便完全通过，而不去认真地注意文字上的问题。我想这就是我们的报纸新闻中时常出现文法上的错误的最基本的原因。
    政策性、原则性的掌握自然是完全必要的；因为这是一篇新闻稿件的灵魂，没有了它们，就不能正确的指导实际工作，发挥应有的战斗作用。但由此就放松了、忽略了以至无视了文字的作用，也是不对的。我们赖以直接传达政策、指导工作的工具就是文字，倘完全忽视了文字所起的作用，那末任何正确的政策必将无由传达，任何具体工作也将无法指导；你的新闻内容再好些，指导性再强些，但由于你所赖以表现的文字不够通顺，措辞不够恰当，人家看不懂，就一定得不到应有的宣传效果。不但如此，在某些情形下，反而会影响了新闻的真实性，削弱了新闻的指导性，战斗性；甚且会引起反作用，难免于被敌人利用了来钻空子。
    因此我们可以肯定的说，政策原则的掌握与文字技术的掌握应该是两者不可偏废的。只注意文字技术而忽视了政策原则的掌握固然不对，只掌握了政策原则而忽视了文字技术，也是一种偏向。
    我们对于一个武装的革命战士的要求不光是具有高度的政治认识、革命气魄等等，我们同时要求他有熟练的作战技术，善于掌握和使用武器。对于新闻工作者，我们的要求也是如此。
    我希望我们每一个新闻工作者把文法问题从思想上重视起来。
