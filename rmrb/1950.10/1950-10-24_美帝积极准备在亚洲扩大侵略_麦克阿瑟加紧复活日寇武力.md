Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 21st, TASS: According to the Telepress Agency: MacArthur approved a plan to establish a future Japanese army at the end of August. This plan was drafted by the Yoshida government under the guidance of Major General Almond of MacArthur's headquarters, and with the assistance of former Japanese army generals Kawamata, Kawada (transliteration), Matsumura, and others.

According to this plan, the strength of the Japanese police force will be increased. Under the guise of this police force, military units are being organized, and officer and sergeant teams are being established. The plan also includes instructions on the funding for implementing this plan.

The military training of this future army must be carried out through police reserve units, so-called "labor units," and various "sports groups." According to the plan, the training and equipment of these units will be modeled after the U.S. military. Therefore, a group of former Japanese generals, headed by General Kawamata, are revising the former Japanese army regulations in accordance with the U.S. military model.

	Employing Former Japanese Generals to Rebuild the Japanese Army and Navy

To increase the number of officers in this military police force, the plan stipulates the employment of former Japanese regular officers who have been "purged." In addition, the training of officers and sergeant cadres is also being carried out on a large scale. The police force has a special "training unit" where sergeants receive one year of training, and officers are trained at local "police schools." The training of officers for engineer and technical and communications teams is entrusted to the headquarters of the so-called "railway police." The Maritime Safety Agency is responsible for training naval officers. In addition, short-term training schools have been established to retrain former Japanese army and navy soldiers. Retired officers from the former Japanese army serve as instructors.

Senior officers are trained directly by MacArthur's headquarters. In addition, new training classes have been opened under the auspices of the former Japanese "Repatriation Bureau" to carry out retraining work. The "Repatriation Bureau" has long become a general headquarters.

The scale of this plan approved by MacArthur and the scope of the work being carried out in this regard clearly demonstrates that the Japanese army and navy currently being established will be used to realize the United States' aggressive aims in Asia.

Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd, TASS, October 20th: Quoting the Japanese student newspaper "Japan Student News": Part of the police reserve force recently established by the Japanese government under the order of MacArthur's headquarters is stationed in Kurume. The police reserve force in this area is equipped with tanks, armored vehicles, and helicopters. Each squad has three light machine guns and six automatic rifles. Currently, the company level is commanded by a U.S. lieutenant, while the platoon level is commanded by a U.S. sergeant. Officers selected from among the Japanese are sent to an officer school in Japan for training.

	More Than 10,000 Reactionaries Have Their Purge Disqualifications Lifted

Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd: MacArthur, the executor of U.S. imperialist aggressive policies in the Far East, is stepping up efforts to foster the revival of Japanese militarist forces to serve as accomplices in the United States' expansion of its war of aggression in the Far East. On October 13th, after obtaining MacArthur's permission, the Yoshida government announced the lifting of purge disqualifications for 10,090 reactionaries. This group includes militarists in the political, economic, military, and cultural fields. The militarists whose purges have been lifted are now actively engaged in colluding with various reactionary political parties, preparing to rise again. According to a Reuters report quoting the Japan Times on the 16th: "Political figures who have had their purges lifted are willing to dissolve the Diet so that they can participate in the elections that follow." Shigeru Yoshida and his Liberal Party have scheduled a banquet on the 25th to entertain 150 "influential political, economic, and journalistic leaders" whose purges have been lifted (Reuters, Tokyo, 14th). Twelve former members of the Minseito system, led by Yatanji Nakajima, former director of the "Imperial Rule Assistance Association" and member of the "National General Mobilization Council," decided to join the National Democratic Party on the 17th. Ryokichi Hirano (former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in the Katayama Cabinet, founder of the "Social Renovation Party"), a splinter element of the peasant movement associated with the Socialist Party, and Motogiro Sugiyama, who was recommended by Hideki Tojo as a member of the Diet, are also actively engaged.

	More Than Fifty Zaibatsu Companies Have Been Removed from the Restricted List

After the purge disqualifications of 539 people with zaibatsu ties, including Shoji Arai, president of the wartime Japan Sending and Receiving Electric Company, were lifted, MacArthur lifted restrictions on more than 50 zaibatsu companies in industries such as coal mining, shipping, metals, steel pipes, cement, and chemicals on the 16th. Now, there are only 463 zaibatsu companies remaining on the restricted list, a decrease of more than 60% from the initial 1,203 companies. The remaining 400+ zaibatsu companies only need to complete the procedure of "selling stocks" to lift the superficial restrictions and resume public activities, serving U.S. monopoly capital.

As early as September 30th, the United Press had revealed that the Yoshida government had discussed with relevant parties the employment of 830 former soldiers who had been purged to serve as the backbone of the so-called "police reserve force." This time, more than 3,000 former military personnel have had their purge disqualifications lifted.

	More Than One Hundred War Criminals Released in a Short Period of Five and a Half Months

At the same time, MacArthur continues to illegally "parole" Japanese war criminals. From May 1st to October 17th, in a short period of five and a half months, MacArthur has successively announced "paroles" for 20 batches of war criminals, totaling 118 people. Among them, the most recently announced six war criminals will soon be released from prison on October 30th, following other "paroled" war criminals. (Attached picture)

　　美帝积极准备在亚洲扩大侵略
    麦克阿瑟加紧复活日寇武力
   【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社布拉格二十一日电：电通社消息：麦克阿瑟在八月底就批准了建立日本将来的陆军的计划。这个计划是吉田政府在麦克阿瑟总部的阿尔梦德少将的指导下，以及前日本陆军将领川俣、川田（译音）、松村等人的协助下拟订的。
   按照这个计划，日本警察部队的实力将要增加。在这支警察部队的伪装下，军事部队正在组织中，并建立军官军士队。该计划还有关于实行该计划的经费的指令。
   这支未来的陆军的军事训练工作，必须通过警察后备队、所谓“劳动队”和各种“体育团体”来进行。按照计划，这些部队的训练和装备将仿照美军。因此，以川俣将军为首的一批前日本将领，正在仿照美军的方式修改前日本陆军条例。
    起用前日寇将领重建日本陆海军
   为了增加这支军事警察军官的人数，该计划规定起用被“整肃”的前日本正规军官。此外，军官和军士干部的训练工作也正在大规模地进行。警察部队特别设有“教导队”，军士在这里受一年训练，军官则在当地“警察学校”受训。工兵和技术与通讯队军官的训练，则委托所谓“铁道警察”总部办理。海上保安厅则负责训练海军军官。此外，现已成立短期训练学校，以重新训练前日本陆海军的士兵。由以前日本军队的退职军官担任教官。
   高级军官直接由麦克阿瑟总部训练。此外，新训练班已在前日本“复员局”主持下开办，以进行重新训练的工作。“复员局”早就成了一个大本营。
   这个麦克阿瑟批准的计划的规模和在这方面所进行的工作的范围，清楚地证明了目前正在建立的日本陆海军，将被用来实现美国在亚洲的侵略目的。
   【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社二十日电引日本学生报纸“日本学生新闻”消息：日本政府最近奉麦克阿瑟总部之命建立的警察后备队，一部分驻扎在久留米。该地的警察后备队装备有坦克、装甲车和直升飞机。每一班有轻机枪三挺和自动步枪六支。目前连级是由美国中尉指挥，而排级是由美国上士指挥。从日本人中间挑选出来的军官则送往日本的一所军官学校训练。
    万余名反动分子被解除整肃处分
   【新华社二十三日讯】美帝国主义侵略政策在远东的执行人麦克阿瑟，正加紧扶植日本军国主义势力复活，以充当美国在远东扩大侵略战争的帮凶。十月十三日，吉田政府于获得麦克阿瑟的准许后，宣布解除一万零九十名反动分子的整肃处分。这批人中包括政治、经济、军事、文化各方面的军国主义分子。被解除整肃的军国主义者现正积极活动，与各反动政党勾结，准备再起。据路透社引十六日日本时报消息称：“已被解除整肃的政治人物，都愿意解散国会，以使他们能参加接着举行的选举”。吉田茂及其自由党，已订于二十五日设宴招待解除整肃的一百五十名“有势力的政治、经济及新闻界领袖”（路透社东京十四日电）。以前“大政翼赞会”总务、“国家总动员审议会”委员中岛弥团次为首的十二名前民政党系统的反动分子，已于十七日决定参加国民民主党。与社会党有关的农民运动分裂分子平野力三（曾任片山内阁农林相，“社会革新党”的创始人）、曾被东条英机推荐为国会议员的杉山元治郎等，也都在积极活动。
    五十余家财阀公司已从限制名单勾销
   在战时日本发送电公司总裁新井章治等五百三十九名财阀关系人员被解除整肃后，麦克阿瑟在十六日又解除了煤矿、海运、金属、钢管、水泥、化学等业财阀公司五十余家的限制。现在剩余在限制名单上的财阀公司仅有四百六十三家，比最初的一千二百零三家，减少了百分之六十以上。而剩余的四百多家财阀公司也只要办清“出卖股票”的手续，即可解除表面的限制，重新公开活动，为美国垄断资本服务。
   早在九月三十日，联合通讯社即曾揭露，吉田政府曾与有关方面商讨起用被整肃的前军人八百三十名，充任所谓“警察后备队”的中坚干部。而此次被解除整肃的前军事人员则达三千余名。
    五个半月短时期内释放战犯一百多名
   与此同时，麦克阿瑟还继续非法“假释”日本战犯。自五月一日至十月十七日为止，在五个半月的短时期内，麦克阿瑟已先后宣布“假释”战犯二十批，共一百十八名。其中最近宣布的六名战犯，即将继其他被“假释”的战犯之后，于十月三十日出狱。（附图片）
