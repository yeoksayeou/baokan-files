　　Northern Anhui Actively Prepares to Harness the Huai River
    Huai River Water Conservancy Bureau Intensifies Surveying
    [Reported by our correspondent Lin Hong] After the severe floods in northern Anhui, Chairman Mao was deeply concerned about the suffering of the people in northern Anhui who had long been plagued by floods, and instructed that the Huai River be harnessed. After the instruction was issued, all Party, government, and military cadres and 20 million people in northern Anhui were extremely excited and determined to work hard to complete this great project of historical significance. The Northern Anhui Administrative Office and the Huai River Water Conservancy Project General Bureau have been actively carrying out various preparatory work. When Chairman Mao's instructions reached the two most severely affected prefectures, Fuyang and Suxian, the masses and cadres believed that there was a solution and hope. This played a significant role in reversing the pessimistic and disappointed mood of the masses and cadres caused by long-term disasters, and also increased the enthusiasm for production and work. Many cadres said: Chairman Mao instructed that the Huai River must be harnessed. Although this is a very arduous task, under the correct guidance of the Central People's Government and the East China Military and Political Committee, we have the confidence and strength to successfully complete this glorious task. The masses reflected: If the Huai River is not harnessed, we will suffer disasters every year. Today, Chairman Mao instructed to harness the Huai River, which is to save the people here. Some even said with great pain and gratitude: The Kuomintang does not want the people and uses floods to harm us; if it were not for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we would have either been washed away by the floods long ago, or starved to death!
    When the reporter met with several water conservancy experts in the Nanjing Huai River Water Conservancy Project General Bureau, who had been engaged in Huai River management for more than ten years, their excitement was indescribable. Wang Zulie is currently the director of the surveying department of the Huai River Water Conservancy Project General Bureau. After graduating from university in the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), he has been working in the Huai River Water Conservancy Project General Bureau. He said with great emotion: The Kuomintang governed the Huai River for more than ten years, and until before liberation, we didn't even have a complete topographic map and hydrological map of the Huai River basin. When I asked about this Huai River management project, Director Wang said: Since liberation, the People's Government has spent a lot of money and mobilized a lot of manpower to engage in Huai River management work; but because the time is too short, the war has not ended, and the national finances are still difficult, it is of course impossible to quickly heal this long-standing festering sore. Today, Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, in view of the seriousness of the Huai River problem, are determined to harness it. Our water conservancy workers feel very happy and excited and fully support it. For many years, we have been willing to do something beneficial for the people, and today we can finally achieve our wishes. Although the basic work of Huai River management in the past was very poor, and we will inevitably encounter many difficulties, we are willing to do everything in our power to ensure the realization of the glorious task Chairman Mao has given us!
    Wu Yi, Dai Qi, Sun Shoupei, and others are all experts who have been engaged in water conservancy work for many years. When I talked to them, they all expressed the same desire.
    In order to strive for the early commencement of the Huai River management project and to solve the livelihood problems of several million disaster-stricken people along the Huai River through work relief, the Northern Anhui Administrative Office and the Huai River Water Conservancy Project General Bureau actively carried out various preparatory work in mid-August. At that time, the Northern Anhui Administrative Office formed a temporary production and disaster relief headquarters to uniformly lead and direct the two major tasks of production and disaster relief and river management. The headquarters temporarily set up six departments: secretariat, political, livelihood relief, financial and grain supply, engineering, and health.
    Mobilizing several million laborers within a few months and carrying out river management work on the several-hundred-mile-long Huai River line is a very arduous and complex organizational task, especially the supply of grain, firewood, and grass, which is even more onerous. After the Northern Anhui Production and Disaster Relief District Headquarters was established, it immediately began to deploy cadres, enrich the organizational structure, and rush to prepare the work plans of its departments. The financial and grain supply department has also sent people to establish warehouses and transfer stations at appropriate locations, and instructed the Chuxian, Liu'an, and Suxian prefectures to begin organizing the felling, purchase, and transportation of firewood and grass.
    In order to be able to make a detailed plan for the Huai River work relief project for this winter and next spring by the end of September, the Huai River Water Conservancy Project General Bureau successively dispatched four surveying teams to Cihe, Suihe, Nanmin River, Zhao Wang River and Menghe in mid-August. According to the surveying team's report, the technical personnel participating in the surveying work, under the extremely difficult conditions of the river water not receding at that time, muddy roads, and many obstacles, still tried every means to continue the surveying. If the low-lying areas were flooded and unable to work, they would change to working on the ridges. Some surveying personnel even waded through water and mud, and still insisted on working, and some got sick due to surveying in the rain, frequently entering and exiting the water, and working on damp ground for a long time. This spirit of not avoiding difficulties and serving the people is commendable.
    The heads of the bureau's engineering, planning, and surveying departments mentioned when talking to me that the most difficult thing now is the lack of technical personnel, especially senior technical personnel. In addition to requesting the central government and East China to find ways to transfer middle and senior-level technical personnel, the bureau plans to jointly recruit graduates from universities and middle schools and unemployed intellectuals with the Northern Anhui Administrative Office to train a group of new technical cadres.

### 皖北积极准备治淮  淮河水利总局加紧进行测量

　　皖北积极准备治淮
    淮河水利总局加紧进行测量
    【本报讯】记者林洪报道：皖北严重水灾发生后，毛主席对长期遭受水灾痛苦的皖北人民十分关怀，曾指示根治淮河。指示下达后，皖北全体党、政、军干部和两千万人民，极为兴奋，决心为完成这一富有历史意义的伟大工程而努力。皖北行署和淮河水利工程总局，并已积极进行各项准备工作。当毛主席的指示传到受灾最重的阜阳和宿县两专区后，群众和干部都认为有办法有希望了，对于扭转群众和干部因长期遭受灾害所产生的悲观失望情绪起了很大的作用，生产和工作的积极性也提高了。许多干部说：毛主席指示要把淮河治好，虽然这是件十分艰巨的工作，但在中央人民政府和华东军政委员会的正确指导下，我们有信心有力量胜利完成这一光荣任务。群众反映说：淮河不治好，我们这里年年都要受灾；今天毛主席指示治好淮河，这是在打救我们这里的老百姓，有的更带着十分痛苦和感激的表情说：国民党不要老百姓，用洪水来残害我们；要不是共产党和毛主席，我们不是早被洪水冲走了，就早饿死了！
    当记者在南京淮河水利工程总局，会见几位从事治淮十几年的水利专家时，他们那种兴奋的心情，难以形容。王祖烈是现在淮河水利工程总局测量处处长，民国二十二年在大学毕业后，就一直在淮河水利工程总局工作，他十分感慨地说：国民党治淮十几年，直到解放前，我们这里连一张完整的淮河流域的地形图和水文图都没有。当我问到这一次的治淮工程时，王处长说：解放以来，人民政府已经花了很多钱，动员了许多人力，从事治淮工作；但因时间太短，战争尚未结束，国家财政还很困难，当然不可能很快把这一块溃烂已久的疮疤医治好。今天毛主席和中央人民政府鉴于淮河问题的严重，下决心把它治好。我们水利工作人员，感到非常愉快、兴奋，完全拥护。多少年来，我们愿意为人民作一点有益的事，今天才算达到愿望。虽然，过去治淮的基本工作很差，不免会碰到许多困难，但我们愿意尽一切力量，保证实现毛主席给我们的光荣任务！
    吴溢、戴祁、孙寿培等，都是从事水利工作多年的专家，我和他们谈话时，他们都表示了同样的愿望。
    为了争取治淮工程早日动工，使沿淮几百万灾民通过以工代赈解决生活问题，皖北行署和淮河水利工程总局，在八月中旬即积极进行各项准备工作。皖北行署在当时即组成生产救灾临时指挥部，统一领导指挥生产救灾和治河两大工作。指挥部下暂设秘书、政治、生救、财粮供应、工程和卫生六处。
    在几个月之内，动员几百万民工，在几百里长的淮河线上，展开治河工作，是一件十分艰巨、复杂的组织工作，特别是粮食、柴、草的供应，更为繁重。皖北生产救灾区时指挥部成立后，即着手调配干部，充实组织机构，和赶制本部门的工作计划。财粮供应处并已派人前往适当地点建立仓库和转运站，指示滁县、六安和宿县专区，开始组织柴草的斫伐、收购和运输。
    淮河水利工程总局为了能在九月底作出今冬明春淮河工赈工程的详细计划，八月中旬曾陆续派出茨河、濉河、南泯河及赵王河和蒙河四个测量队。据测量队的报告所说，参加测量工作的技术人员，在当时河水未退，道路泥泞和障碍物甚多等极端困难的情况下，仍然想尽各种方法，继续进行测量。洼地水淹，不能工作，就改在岗边进行。有的测量人员甚至涉水踏泥，仍然坚持工作，有因冒雨进行测量，经常出入水中和长时间在潮湿地面工作而得病的。此种不避艰难，为人民服务的精神，值得表扬。
    该局工程、规划和测量三处的负责人和我谈话时，都提到现在最感困难的是技术人员，特别是高级技术人员的缺乏。除中上级技术人员，请中央和华东设法抽调外，该局准备与皖北行署共同招收大中学毕业的学生和失业的知识分子，训练一批新的技术干部。（附图片）
