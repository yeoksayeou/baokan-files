　　Xinhua News Agency, 16th. The All-China Journalists Association invited Hronek, Secretary-General of the International Organization of Journalists, who is currently here, to report on the struggle of the International Organization of Journalists to defend peace and oppose aggression.

The conference resolved to call on journalists around the world who are faithful to the truth and engaged in truthful reporting to further unite and strengthen the struggle against aggressive war and to defend world peace.
