Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 14th. The Second Plenary Meeting of the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee was held from September 16th to 27th. The central topic of this meeting was to discuss the implementation of land reform in the Central-South region this winter and next spring. The meeting listened to and approved the work report of Deng Zihui, Vice Chairman of the Military and Administrative Committee. This report summarized the work since the first meeting of the Military and Administrative Committee in February this year, especially the rural social reform movement centered on preparing for land reform in various parts of Central-South in the past six months. The meeting also listened to and approved the report of Li Xuefeng, Director of the Land Reform Committee, "Striving to Complete the Land Reform Plan for This Winter and Next Spring," and discussed and approved the plan for implementing land reform in the Central-South region this winter and next spring, approving the implementation and completion of land reform in 161 counties in the Central-South provinces, with a population of approximately 50 million; the remaining areas where rent reduction has not been implemented or has not yet begun will continue to implement rent reduction. The areas where land reform will be implemented this winter and next spring are: 43 counties in Henan with a population of approximately 12 million, 23 counties in Hubei with a population of approximately 7 million, 44 counties in Jiangxi with a population of approximately 7 million, 31 counties in Hunan with a population of over 17 million, 3 counties in Guangdong with a population of over 2 million, and 17 counties in Guangxi with a population of over 4 million. In addition, the meeting, based on the specific conditions of the Central-South provinces, after detailed discussion, formulated implementation measures for the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China in the Central-South region. Furthermore, the meeting also approved the resolution on the military report of Tan Zheng, the resolution on the financial and economic work report of Li Yiqing, the resolution on the cultural and educational work report of Zhao Yimin, the resolution on the supervisory work report of Qian Ying, the resolution on the preparatory work report of Du Runsheng for land reform, and the resolution on the half-year work reports of six provinces and two cities (Wuhan, Guangzhou).
Deng Zihui, Vice Chairman, and Li Xuefeng, Director, pointed out in their reports: Since the first meeting of the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee in February this year, the rural social reform movement in Central-South, which focused on suppressing bandits, combating local bullies, and reducing rent, has achieved great results. During this period, in addition to 43 counties in Henan distributing land, the People's Liberation Army and the People's Public Security Forces continued to eliminate 210,000 remnant bandits in some of the more remote rural areas of Central-South, removing obstacles for rural work. On the basis of the victory in suppressing bandits, rent reduction was carried out this spring in areas with a population of 60 million, accounting for half of the region's agricultural population. Currently, the total number of peasant association members in the Central-South region has reached over 25 million, and the rural people's self-defense armed forces have reached 1.03 million. On the basis of mobilizing the peasant masses, representative conferences of all sectors of the county and peasant representative conferences at all levels were widely convened, the Baojia system in rural areas was abolished, and new rural people's governments were established. This summer, various localities also used the gaps in production to summarize and review the work of rent reduction, and to rectify the organization of peasant associations, further mobilizing the peasant masses and raising their awareness. In areas where the rectification of peasant associations has been done well, not only has the peasant ranks been purified, but also expanded, thereby laying the foundation for land reform this winter and next spring. Since July and August, the rural work cadres throughout the region have also universally conducted a rectification movement from top to bottom. According to statistics from Jiangxi and Hubei provinces, more than 44,000 cadres have been trained. Some of these cadres are veteran cadres with rich experience in peasant movement work, and some are peasant activists or revolutionary intellectuals. They have established close ties with the broad masses of peasants in various parts of Central-South. After rectification and training, their policy thinking and work style have been corrected, and they have become one of the main forces in the land reform work in Central-South this winter and next spring.

Inviting peasant activists from various provinces to attend and listen to speeches by peasant activists from Henan

The meeting also studied the experience of implementing land reform in 43 counties in Henan this spring. After listening to the speech of Zhang Xi, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the meeting also invited peasant activists from various provinces to attend and listen to speeches by many peasant activists from Henan. After discussion, the meeting unanimously and clearly recognized that land reform is a huge struggle and must be realized by mobilizing the peasant masses. The meeting held that the experience of Henan in implementing land reform and the warm support of the broad masses of peasants in Central-South for the Land Reform Law prove that peasants are most able to abide by government decrees and national discipline. Peasants are able to give up certain immediate interests and act in accordance with policies. For example, if they are told not to touch the hidden wealth of landlords, the peasants will not touch it. Many landlords can also abide by the law after the promulgation of the Land Reform Law. In the recent two months, some illegal landlords in Hunan and Jiangxi were found to be destroying means of production. These acts should be dealt with according to their severity, either by mobilizing the peasants to reason with them through struggle, or by imposing legal sanctions.

The meeting put forward points to note for land reform:

	I. Carrying out land reform work should be closely combined with production.

	II. Expand the peasant association and unite all forces.

	III. Strengthen the suppression of bandits and the prevention of special agents, and improve the rural political power.

The meeting held that the scale of land reform in Central-South this winter and next spring is very large and there are still many difficulties; it is necessary to fully pay attention to mobilizing the peasant masses, preventing chaos, and preventing the occurrence of "half-cooked rice" in the work. First, it must be clearly recognized that the basic purpose of land reform is to develop industrial and agricultural production, and the work should pay attention to being closely integrated with production. Second, it is necessary to implement the general policy of land reform, rely on poor peasants and farm laborers, unite middle peasants and neutralize rich peasants, strive for enlightened gentry, and strive for all social forces that can be won over; but first, the peasant association must be strengthened in order to better unite friends and complete land reform. Third, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the suppression of bandits and the prevention of special agents, implement rent reduction, improve rural people's political power, and establish people's courts, people's supervisory committees, and people's procuratorates to ensure the implementation of the Land Reform Law.

The conference closed on the 27th. Cheng Qian, Vice Chairman of the Military and Administrative Committee, in his closing speech, called on all committee members and delegates attending the meeting to resolutely implement the resolutions of the conference, mobilize the peasant masses, and ensure the victorious completion of the land reform plan in the Central-South region this winter and next spring.

　　中南军政委员会二次会议
    讨论实行土地改革问题
    全区农民协会会员已达二千五百余万，干部经过整训成为土改主要力量之一。
    【新华社汉口十四日电】中南军政委员会第二次全体会议，已于九月十六日至二十七日举行。这次会议的中心议题，是讨论今冬明春中南区实行土地改革的问题。会议听取并通过了军政委员会邓子恢副主席的工作报告。这个报告总结了今年二月军政委员会第一次会议以来的工作，特别是半年来中南各地以准备实行土地改革为中心的农村社会改革运动。会议又听取并通过了土地改革委员会李雪峰主任“为完成今冬明春土地改革计划而斗争”的报告，并讨论和通过了中南区今冬明春实行土地改革的计划，批准中南各省一百六十一县共约五千万人口的地区，于今冬明春实行并完成土地改革；其余尚未贯彻或尚未进行减租的地区继续实行减租。今冬明春实行土地改革的地区计为：河南四十三县人口约一千二百万，湖北二十三县人口约七百万，江西四十四县人口约七百万，湖南三十一县人口一千七百多万，广东三县人口二百多万，广西十七县人口四百多万。会议又根据中南各省的具体情况，经过详尽讨论，制定了关于中华人民共和国土地改革法中南地区实施办法。此外，会议并通过了谭政委员半年来军事报告的决议，李一清委员财经工作报告的决议，赵毅敏委员文教工作报告的决议，钱瑛委员监察工作报告的决议，杜润生委员土地改革准备工作报告的决议，和六省二市（武汉、广州）半年工作报告的决议。
    邓子恢副主席和李雪峰主任的报告指出：今年二月中南军政委员会首次会议以来，中南各地以剿匪、反恶霸和减租为主的农村社会改革运动成绩很大。在这期间，除河南有四十三个县分配了土地外，人民解放军和人民公安部队，在中南部分较为偏僻的农村中，继续消灭残匪二十一万，为农村工作扫除了障碍。在剿匪胜利的基础上，占全区农业人口一半的六千万人口的地区，在今春进行了减租。现在，中南全区农民协会会员已达二千五百多万，农村人民的自卫武装达一百零三万。在农民群众发动的基础上，各地普遍召开了县各界代表会议和各级农民代表会议，废除了乡村的保甲制度，建立了新的乡村人民政府。今年夏天，各地又利用生产的空隙，进行减租工作的总结和复查，并整顿农民协会的组织，进一步发动了农民群众，提高了农民的觉悟。凡农民协会整顿工作作得较好的地区，农民队伍不只纯洁了，而且扩大了，从而为今冬明春的土地改革打下了基础。七、八月份以来，全区农村工作干部又自上而下普遍进行了整风运动。江西、湖北两省统计，经过整训的干部已达四万四千多人。这些干部有的是富有农民运动工作经验的老干部，有的是农民积极分子或革命知识分子，他们与中南各地广大的农民群众已建立起密切的联系。他们经过整训，政策思想和工作作风端正了，已成为中南今冬明春土地改革工作的主要力量之一。
    邀请各省农民积极分子列席听取河南农民积极分子讲话
    会议并曾研究河南今春四十三县实行土地改革的经验。会议在听了现任中共河南省委书记张玺委员的发言之后，并曾邀请各省农民积极分子列席，听取了河南省许多农民积极分子的讲话。经过讨论，会议一致明确地认识了：土地改革是一场巨大的斗争，必须发动农民群众才能实现。会议认为：河南实行土地改革的经验，和中南广大农民对土地改革法的热烈拥护，证明农民最能遵守政府的政令和国家的纪律。农民能够放弃眼前的某些利益，而按照政策办事。例如，说不动地主的浮财，农民就不动。不少地主在土地改革法颁布后也能守法，最近两月，湖南、江西发现的某些不法地主破坏生产资料等行为，则应分别轻重，或发动农民和他们进行说理斗争，或予以法律制裁。
  会议提出土改注意事项：
    一、进行土改工作，密切结合生产
    二、壮大农民协会，团结一切力量
    三、加强肃匪防特，健全乡村政权
    会议认为：中南今冬明春的土地改革规模很大，困难仍多；必须充分注意发动农民群众，注意防止混乱和防止工作中发生“夹生饭”的现象。第一，必须明确地认识土地改革的基本目的是为了发展工、农业生产，工作中应注意紧密地与生产相结合。第二，必须贯彻土地改革的总方针，依靠贫农、雇农，团结中农和中立富农，争取开明士绅，争取一切可以争取的社会力量；但首先应壮大农民协会，才能更好地团结朋友，完成土地改革。第三，必须继续加强肃匪防特，贯彻减租，健全乡村人民政权和建立人民法庭、人民监察委员会、人民检察署等工作，以保证土地改革法的贯彻执行。
    二十七日大会闭幕。军政委员会程潜副主席在闭幕词中，号召与会全体委员与列席代表，把大会决议坚决贯彻下去，发动农民群众，保证今冬明春中南区土地改革计划的胜利完成。
