　　The Suppression of Bandits in Yunnan
　　Jiang Heng
　　Yunnan, located on the southwestern border, bordering Burma to the west and Vietnam to the south, is a strategically important area for national defense in the southwest. The remnants of the American imperialist stooge Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, taking advantage of this complex national defense border and deep mountains, instigated its defeated soldiers and local landlord-special agent armed forces to carry out armed rebellions. Since mid-April of this year, these bandit-special agent armed forces, taking advantage of the fact that our main forces had just arrived and local work had not yet begun, used reactionary slogans such as "resisting grain and taxes" and "cooperating with the Third World War" as a call to organize rebellions in most parts of the province. In some core areas, the situation even became more serious for a time. Bandit-special agents went out to attack our district and township governments, capture and kill our cadres, and rob our public grain and tax funds. Some even gathered thousands of people and once captured Yimen, Xinping, and other places. By mid-May, at the height of the banditry, there were as many as 260 bandit gangs. This not only directly threatened the lives and property of the broad masses of people and the stability of social order, but also seriously hindered the work of grain storage, taxation, production, and consolidation of national defense.
　　In response to this situation, the Yunnan Military Region and the Dianxi and Diannan Working Committees, in order to defend the national defense of the motherland, successively convened meetings of cadres at all levels in mid-April, clarifying that "suppressing bandits and special agents and stabilizing social order is a prerequisite for doing all work well"; at the same time, "participating in local work and mobilizing the masses are effective ways to thoroughly eliminate bandits." All officers and soldiers of the military region and local work cadres, under the call of "consolidating national defense, defending peace, and opposing American imperialist aggression," launched a heroic and arduous struggle to suppress bandits.
　　Under this high tide of revolutionary heroism and bandit suppression for meritorious service, the troops of the Yunnan Military Region, day and night, climbed mountains and ridges, endured hunger and cold, and braved wind and rain, standing on the national defense line and suppressing bandits and special agents. In the process of suppressing bandits, they also realized the call for the combat team to also be a work team and a production team.
　　From mid-April to mid-August, for four months, all officers and soldiers of the military region, in the bandit suppression battles, carried forward the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army and created countless examples of heroic and skillful combat. For example, after a certain regiment in Dianxi received the task of pursuing and annihilating the remnants of Gu Jiehou and Zhang Tongsen's bandit forces fleeing westward, some of the remnants had already crossed the Jinsha River for 260 li. The regiment then crossed dozens of miles of high mountains and ridges, pursuing overnight, without sleep, food, or water. When their shoes rotted, they wrapped their feet with hand towels and walked. After several days of chasing, they reached the Jinsha River, but the boats had been sunk by the remnants. They then marched 120 li overnight to detour to the Hemen ferry, and with the enthusiastic help of the masses, they finally crossed the natural barrier of the Jinsha River. After ten days and nine nights of continuous pursuit of more than a thousand li, they finally annihilated this bandit gang of more than a thousand people in Pingchuan and Jiangying Street. Another story is that when the Qujing Military Sub-district troops were suppressing the Fu Chonghua bandit gang in Fucun, Pingyi County, the Fu bandits fled to a mountain peak with strange stone forests, attempting to resist stubbornly. The mountain peak stood tall, surrounded by cliffs and precipices, making it extremely difficult to climb. It wasn't until almost dark that Deputy Company Commander Wang Tiancai had a flash of inspiration and led the soldiers to grab the vines and swing across a two-zhang-wide precipice like a swing. But then they encountered a second difficulty: there was a one-zhang-high cliff with no vines at all, so they had to grab the sharp stone corners and climb up. After climbing up, it was dense forest and rocks, bullets couldn't hit them, and shouting didn't make them surrender. "What to do?" "Throw grenades!" After a fierce battle, they finally wiped out these stubborn bandits. There are many examples of such tenacious fighting. Some launched eight consecutive night attacks in ten days, and some went without oil, salt, and vegetables for thirteen days, but the soldiers' morale became stronger as they fought. They all said, "We will not withdraw until we eliminate the bandits!" "Wherever the enemy flees, we will chase them there!" They sang, "...We are all heroes, determined to suppress bandits and not afraid of difficulties, wherever there are bandits, we will go there, not afraid of wading through water and climbing high mountains! We will wipe out the bandits as soon as possible and build a new Yunnan!"
　　These People's Liberation Army soldiers standing on the national defense line not only took the initiative to suppress bandits militarily, but also, under the unified and comprehensive bandit suppression policy, actively mobilized the masses and launched political offensives, achieving a close combination of the three. The work teams or propaganda groups formed by the party, government, and military, under the slogan of "everyone propagandizing, everyone speaking up," universally convened meetings of bandit families, baojia, and the masses in various places to publicize the various policies of the people's government to the masses. Through the broad masses, they strived to win over and disintegrate the bandits, and thereby mobilize the masses to spontaneously rise up to defend themselves against bandits. For example, a certain regiment in Dianxi, due to the correct implementation of the policy of "the ringleaders must be punished, the coerced will not be questioned, and the meritorious will be rewarded," received the surrender of 270 bandits in half a month. Also, many bandit suppression troops mobilized the masses by actually helping them with production and labor, so that they consciously and voluntarily organized to assist in bandit suppression and defense, and strengthened their relationship with the masses. When the Second Company of a certain regiment was stationed in a certain place, they universally helped the masses carry water, sweep the floor, harvest wheat, and hoe the land, which moved the masses to spread the word: "They are really a good team for the people!" Villager Hu Fengyi not only turned in his own Czech-style rifle, but also, with his help, turned in five more guns. After helping the masses collect firewood in Xiaolong Street, villager Li Zongde mobilized and persuaded coerced followers to turn in 26 guns in one day. When a certain regiment was pursuing and suppressing the remnants of Gu and Zhang, when passing through the Greater and Lesser Liang Mountains and the Great Snow Mountains, due to the implementation of the ethnic minority policy, the Yi compatriots were so moved that they spontaneously cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to search for and suppress the remnants of the bandits everywhere, and drove cattle, sheep, chickens, and ducks down from the mountains to慰问the troops. They said: "You are as kind to us as the Red Army, truly Chairman Mao's troops!" The masses in Shian Township and Zhonghe Township in the Eshan Central District even formed a militia joint defense, actively cooperating with the troops to eliminate the fleeing bandits. This fully demonstrated the great strength of the masses and their contribution to the bandit suppression work.
　　In short, for more than four months, due to the efforts of the Yunnan Military Region troops, local armed forces, and local workers in implementing the policy of "resolutely suppressing bandits, mobilizing the masses, strengthening united front work, implementing policies, and overcoming commandism," they have all made the greatest efforts to love the motherland and defend the national defense. Therefore, they have successively and thoroughly annihilated the remnants of Gu Jiehou and Zhang Tongsen's bandit forces fleeing in Dianxi, Hou Maoqi's bandit gang of the pseudo-Dianxi Column, Jin Shaoyun's troops of the pseudo-"People's Anti-Communist Self-Defense Army Dian General Allied Army" in Diannan, Wang Yaoyun's bandit troops of the pseudo-"Dian Dong Military and Political Commander" and rebellious bandits in Dian Dongbei, totaling more than 16,000 people... and Qiu Zhensheng's bandit troops of the pseudo-Diannan Column and others have all surrendered to us one after another. After the feudal forces in Yunnan suffered this severe blow, this forced the banditry in the entire province to decline rapidly. Except for a few border areas, the bandit gangs in the core areas have been basically wiped out, thereby removing the main obstacles to rural reform and the construction of a new Yunnan.
　　However, because Yunnan is located on the national defense border, the bandit-special agents are still trying to struggle desperately, often sending scattered bandits, combined with local landlord-special agents, to hide in the hinterland, assassinate our cadres, and attack district and township governments. Therefore, the Yunnan Military Region is now calling on all regions and villages to build碉堡, mobilize the masses to implement village-to-village joint defense, in order to completely eliminate the scourge of bandits.

　　云南的剿匪斗争
    江横
    云南地当西南边陲，西界缅甸，南接越南，为西南国防上的重地，美帝国主义走狗蒋匪帮残余势力，利用这个复杂的国防边界及深山峻岭，策动其败兵残将及地主特务武装，进行武装暴乱，从今年四月中旬以后，这些匪特武装便乘我大军初到，地方工作尚未展开的空隙，即以“抗粮抗税”、以及“配合三次大战”等等反动口号为号召，在全省大部地区组织叛乱，尤以某些腹心地区曾一时发展较为严重，匪特四出攻占我区、乡政府，捕杀我干部，劫夺我公粮税款；甚至啸聚数千人，一度陷我易门、新平等地。直到五月中旬，为匪焰最盛时期，股匪多达二百六十股。这不仅直接威胁着广大人民的生命财产安全，和社会秩序的安定，并且严重的阻碍着囤粮、税收、生产以及巩固国防等工作。
    针对这一情况，云南军区及滇西、滇南工委，为了保卫祖国国防，曾于四月中旬，先后召集了各级干部会议，明确了“剿灭匪特，安定社会秩序，乃是做好一切工作的先决条件”；同时，“参加地方工作，发动群众，又是彻底肃清土匪的有效办法。”全军区指战员以及地方工作干部，便在“巩固国防，保卫和平和反对美帝国主义侵略”的号召下，展开了英勇的艰苦的剿匪斗争。
    就在这种高度的革命英雄主义和剿匪立功热潮下，云南军区部队，日以继夜，爬山越岭，忍饥挨饿，不避风雨，站在国防线上，进剿匪特；在剿匪中，并实现了战斗队又是工作队、生产队的号召。
    从四月中旬到八月中旬四个月来，全军区指战员，在剿匪战斗中，曾经发扬了解放军光荣的传统，创造了无数英勇善战的范例。如：滇西某团接到追歼西逃残匪顾介侯、张桐森部的任务后，一部残匪已渡过金沙江二百六十里了。某团便逾越上下数十里的高山峻岭，连夜追击，睡不上觉，吃不上饭，喝不上水，鞋子烂掉了用手巾绑腿裹着脚走。追了几天，追到金沙江边，船只又被残匪打沉，他们便连夜以一百二十里的急行军，绕到河门渡口，在群众的热情帮助下，这才渡过天险金沙江。经过十天九夜千余里的连续追击，终于把这一千余人的股匪，全部消灭在平川和姜营街。另一个故事是，曲靖分区部队，进剿平彝县富村傅重华股匪时，傅匪逃在石柱子一座怪石林立的山峰上，妄图顽抗。山峰耸立，周围都是峭壁悬崖，绝难爬上去。一直等到天快黑了，连副王天才便急中生智，带领战士抓着树藤，像打秋千一样的荡过两丈多宽的断崖。但又遇见第二个难关，有一丈高的峭壁根本没有树藤，只好抓着尖石角往上爬。爬上去后又是密林丛石，枪子儿打不着，喊话又不缴枪，“怎么办呢？”。“扔手榴弹！”一阵混战后，才把这些顽抗的匪徒消灭掉。像这样顽强战斗的事例是很多的，有的在十天中连续夜袭八次，有的十三天吃不到油盐菜，而战士的情绪则愈战愈旺盛。他们都表示“不剿灭土匪不收兵！”“敌人逃到那里，追到那里！”他们歌唱着：“……我们都是英雄汉，坚决剿匪不怕难，那里有匪那里去，不怕趟水爬高山！早把土匪消灭净，建设新云南！”
    这些站在国防线上的人民解放军，不仅做到了从军事上主动进剿，并且在一元化的全面剿匪政策下，积极发动群众、展开政治攻势，做到了三者的密切结合。由党政军组成的工作队或部队宣传小组，在“人人宣传，个个开口”的口号下，都在各地普遍地召开了匪属、保甲、群众大会等，向群众宣传了人民政府各种政策，通过广大群众去争取与瓦解土匪，并从而发动群众自动起来进行防匪自卫。譬如：滇西某团由于正确执行了“首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖”的政策，半个月中向该团投降的土匪即达二百七十名。又如，很多剿匪的部队，从实际帮助群众生产劳动来发动群众，使其自觉自愿组织起来，协助剿匪防匪，而密切了与群众的关系，某团二连驻在某地时，普遍展开帮助群众担水、扫地、割麦、锄地，感动得群众纷纷传告：“真是老百姓的好队伍！”老乡胡风义不但缴出自己的一支捷克式步枪，并经他的帮助，又缴了五支枪。在小龙街帮助群众拾柴后，老乡李宗德一天动员规劝胁从分子缴出二十六支枪。某团追剿顾、张残匪，路经大小凉山、大雪山时，由于执行了少数民族政策，感动得彝族同胞自动配合解放军到处搜剿残匪，并从高山上赶下牛羊、鸡鸭来慰问部队，他们说：“你们和红军一样的对我们和气，真是毛主席的队伍！”峨山中心区谥安乡、中和乡的群众，更组成民兵联防，配合部队积极肃清流窜的土匪。这在在表现了群众的伟大力量和对剿匪工作的贡献。
    总之，四个多月以来，由于云南军区部队，地方武装及地方工作人员，在执行“坚决剿匪，发动群众，加强统战工作，执行政策，克服命令主义”的方针下，都尽了热爱祖国，保卫国防的最大努力，因此，曾先后彻底歼灭了流窜滇西的残匪顾介侯、张桐森部、伪滇西纵队侯茂祺股匪，滇南伪“人民反共自卫军滇总联军”金绍云部，滇东北伪“滇东军政长官”及叛匪王耀云等匪部共达一万六千余人。……而伪滇南纵队邱振声等匪部则均先后向我投降。云南封建势力遭此严重打击后，这就迫使全省匪焰迅速下降，除边防若干地区外，腹心区股匪已被基本扑灭，从而扫除了农村改革及建设新云南的主要障碍。
    但因云南地处国防边疆，匪特仍图死力挣扎，经常派遣零散土匪，结合地主特务，隐蔽腹地，暗杀我干部，袭击区乡政府。所以，现在云南军区正号召各地区村建筑碉堡，发动群众实行村村联防，以彻底消除匪患。
