　　Liaodong Agricultural Labor Model Representatives
    Report to Chairman Mao on Safe Journey
    Will Surely Follow Instructions to Make Next Year's Production Even Better
    [Reported by this newspaper] Seven agricultural labor model representatives, including Chen Tingshan, from Liaodong Province who attended the National Labor Model Representative Conference, departed for home on October 10th after receiving a warm welcome from all sides in Shenyang. Before leaving, they jointly wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting their safe journey and the good harvest in Liaodong this autumn. The full text of the original letter is as follows: Dear Chairman Mao:
    We have arrived home safely, please don't worry about us. We were welcomed everywhere along the way, and all this glory is given to us by you. The villagers surrounded us, asking all sorts of questions, saying, "You have seen Chairman Mao this time, and you are content!" We feel even greater glory. When we told them that you are in good health, they jumped up happily and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!"
    The autumn harvest here is almost over, and the harvest is very good this year. This is all a victory for your leadership in our production. We will definitely tell everyone what you instructed us, and make next year's production even better; we will also tell everyone the experience we learned this time, and take better care of next year's crops, and support our army in liberating Taiwan and liberating Tibet. When the autumn harvest comes next year, we will report our production achievements to you again.
    Respectfully wishing you good health
    Liaodong Province Labor Model Representatives Chen Tingshan Zhao Qizhi Liu Changzeng Zhang Defu Min Dongsheng

　　辽东农业劳模代表
    向毛主席报告旅途平安
    一定遵照指示把明年生产搞得更好
    【本报讯】辽东省出席全国劳模代表会议的农业劳模代表陈廷山等七人，在沈阳受到各方热烈招待后，已于十月十日分别启程返家，临行前联名写信给毛主席，报告旅途平安和今年辽东秋收的好年景。原信全文如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    我们已经平安的到家了，请您不要挂念。一路上到处受到欢迎，这个光荣都是您给我们的，乡亲们都围着我们问长问短，都说：“你们这回看到了毛主席，算是心满意足了！”我们更觉得是最大的光荣。当我们告诉他们，您的身体很健康，都高兴的跳起来喊“毛主席万岁！”
    这里的秋收都快完了，今年年景很好，这都是您领导我们生产的胜利。我们一定把您指示我们的话，告诉大家，把明年的生产搞得更好；把这次学的经验，也告诉大家，把明年的庄稼侍弄的更好，支援咱们的军队解放台湾、解放西藏。等明年秋天秋收的时候，再把我们的生产成绩报告您。
    敬祝身体健康
