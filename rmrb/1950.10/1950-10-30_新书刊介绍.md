New Book and Magazine Introductions

*Study* Magazine, Volume III, Number 3

The third issue of Volume III of *Study* magazine is about to be published. This issue features an editorial entitled "We Must Study Current Affairs," pointing out that the current war of aggression against Korea by American imperialism not only threatens the independence, freedom, and survival of the Korean people, but also seriously threatens the security of our motherland. The relationship between Korea and China is one of "lips and teeth." Therefore, the Chinese people must take appropriate steps to support the Korean people and smash the American imperialists' plot to defeat us one by one. It then calls on all troops, organizations, factories, and schools to attach importance to studying this issue, and points out that in the study, any illusions about American imperialism should be thoroughly criticized, any fear of American imperialism should be eliminated, and all complacency,僥幸, and fear of difficulties should be opposed.

The main articles in this issue include: Ai Siqi's "Learning from the Soviet Union's Patriotism and Internationalism," Fu Ying's "American Imperialism Can Be Defeated," Ye Huosheng's "China's Feudal Society," and Di Chaobai's "The Nature and Laws of Various Profits in the Transition Period." The systematic explanation articles include the third lecture of "Basic Knowledge Lectures on Social Sciences," "Class," and the third lecture of "Explanation of Imperialism," "The Role of Banks and Financial Capital."

The "Study Review" column in this issue features two articles: "Studying Imperialism and Understanding American Imperialism" and "The Compilation of Theoretical Study for On-the-Job Cadres." The "Bi-Weekly Talk" column features three articles: "Excessive Lenience Actually Helps Counter-Revolutionaries," "The Personality of People's Heroes," and "Carried Away in Baskets." The "Study Random Talk" column features two articles: "Lazy Thoughts in Study" and "Several Opinions on Cadre Study." The "Brief Explanation of Terms" column continues to publish "Annotations to Lenin's *State and Revolution*." The "Reader Discussion Forum" column publishes four articles, including Guo Shengwu's "My Views on Wang Dingchen's Ideological Remolding." In addition, there is a "Questions and Answers" column that answers questions such as "No Feudalism in Jiangnan" and "Opportunism."

*Chinese Children* Number 26

The 26th issue of *Chinese Children* was published on October 28th. This issue publishes a letter from Korean children to Chinese children, saying that they are now encountering the same difficult tests as China in the past, but they have seen the fact of the Chinese people's victory, which has greatly increased their confidence in defeating the enemy. They are now using all their talents, wisdom, and strength to support the front line and strive for the victory of their motherland. To accompany this letter, there is also "Victory Must Belong to the Korean People!" writing about the heroic situation of the Korean People's Army defending the territory of the motherland. Jin Jin wrote a fairy tale poem this issue called "The Result of War Peddlers," illustrated by Lu Shaofei. "Young Pioneers," with lyrics by Jia Zhi and music by Lü Ji, is also published in this issue. Ding Kexin wrote a children's story this issue called "Liu Chuang's Awkwardness is Resolved!" In addition, Zhu Hong wrote a science trick: "Water Firecrackers" presents children with a strange toy. Water can also explode like firecrackers. It turns out that there is also a scientific principle here. Ren Daling's "Lazy Man and Old Man Soil" is a very educational fairy tale. Mei Qing's "Meeting with Female Tractor Driver Liang Jun" introduces a very good team activity. "Report on a Trip Around the World," originally published in the Soviet Young Pioneer Truth, and Mr. Zuo Lin's "Travels of 45,000 Li" (this issue writes about the Peak Tram in Hong Kong) continue to be published. In addition, there are children's works such as "Throwing Away the Rotten Paper Basket," "Old Man Li Fell for the Almanac," and "Chairman Mao Reviewed Us."
