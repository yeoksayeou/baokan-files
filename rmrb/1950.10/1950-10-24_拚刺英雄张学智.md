　　Bayonet Hero Zhang Xuezhi
    Yao Wenfu
    "Bayonet Hero" Zhang Xuezhi was originally a platoon leader of the Third Platoon of the Second Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army. He is twenty-four years old this year and comes from a poor peasant family. He is not very tall, but his red face looks quite "ferocious."
    Comrade Zhang Xuezhi is a glorious Communist Party member who has demonstrated boundless loyalty to the Party and the people in every battle. He has fought in fifty or sixty battles, large and small, and has been wounded five times. His left arm is now disabled. He was awarded the title of "Second Class Combat Hero" for capturing an enemy tank alive in the Datong Campaign in 1946. In 1948, he was awarded the title of "Bayonet Hero" for the Battle of Babaoshan.
    On October 11, 1948, in order to defend Shijiazhuang, the troops rushed to the section from Xiahuayuan to Xin’an in the Ping-Sui Railway overnight to carry out a demolition mission. The frantic enemy followed with three armies, attempting to hold us back and prevent us from advancing. At dawn on the 12th, the enemy first sent out armored vehicles to protect the road and fired at us. According to the situation at that time, only by destroying the armored vehicles could the troops smoothly carry out the demolition mission.
    Zhang Xuezhi completed this arduous task of destroying the armored vehicles. At this time, the enemy and we were only separated by two hills. The bandits attempted to seize the commanding heights of the southern hill to prevent our troops from leaving the pass and planned to "annihilate" our army in one fell swoop, so they began to climb from behind the mountain. The situation was becoming tense, and seizing the commanding heights of the hill became the key to victory or defeat. The entire platoon immediately engaged in a climbing race with the enemy and quickly rushed to the hillside. At this time, it was discovered that the enemy was also rushing upwards, and their vanguard had already seized the top of the hill. In this situation, if any fear or hesitation was shown, there was a risk of being annihilated. However, Comrade Zhang Xuezhi did not hesitate or fear. Taking advantage of the enemy's unstable footing and the fact that the enemy's follow-up troops had not yet arrived, he launched a fierce attack. Grenades and volleys of gunfire were fired, immediately driving the enemy off the hilltop and immediately rushing down the hill. He rushed forward in a few steps, killing two enemies with his bayonet. In the battle to seize the hilltop, except for a few who managed to escape, the enemy's entire company was killed or wounded on the hillside. However, the Third Platoon led by Zhang Xuezhi suffered no casualties.
    The battalion commander ordered the Second Platoon to take over, and the Third Platoon to go down for food. Zhang Xuezhi and his soldiers had just eaten half a meal when the enemy began to attack again. So the entire platoon immediately dropped their bowls and accepted the combat mission to seize Babaoshan on the north side! Comrade Zhang Xuezhi led everyone forward while raising the slogan: "Comrades, strive for victory in climbing the mountain. Climbing up means victory, not climbing up means death." The mountain was high and the road steep. Everyone climbed on tree roots and threw themselves into the grass, pushing forward and pulling backward, quickly seizing the summit of Babaoshan, which was about four li high. Under the cover of fierce artillery fire, the enemy launched an attack on Babaoshan with two battalions, and four mountain guns bombarded the Third Platoon's position, making it impossible for people to raise their heads. At this time, the enemy had rushed to the hillside, and Zhang Xuezhi ordered the soldiers: "Get the grenades ready, we must maintain the glory of the Iron First Battalion of the Great Meritorious Regiment and hold the position!" Before the shout was over, a shell exploded beside him, and a piece of shrapnel went into his buttock, and blood flowed down. At this time, the enemy's vanguard of two companies had rushed up and were approaching the front line, but Comrade Zhang Xuezhi still insisted on fighting. Volleys of gunfire and grenades were fired, and the three machine guns also chattered, hitting the enemy so that they rolled and crawled. But the enemy's supervisors forced the bandits to rush up with broadswords and machine guns. Zhang Xuezhi's platoon launched another volley of grenades. But under the pressure of the supervisors, the enemy continued to rush upwards. Seeing the tense situation, Zhang Xuezhi immediately stood up and stood at the front. The blood from the wound on his buttock kept flowing down his thigh, his legs were a little weak, so he had to lean against the mountain rock, holding up his bayonet and waiting for the enemy to approach. At this time, two enemies rushed up and stabbed him fiercely. Comrade Zhang Xuezhi immediately parried the enemy's gun, and then with a "thrust" stabbed one enemy to death! Then he quickly turned around and stabbed the second enemy to death. When four more enemies rushed up and lined up with him, Comrade Zhang Xuezhi immediately used a swift and brave action, stabbing and killing one with his bayonet. Then he drew his knife and flipped over, using a chop to knock the second one down from his left arm. At this time, the third enemy took the opportunity to stab him in the lower part with a gun, but he immediately used a "defend down" action to parry the enemy's gun and stabbed into the enemy's right rib. He took advantage of the victory to organize a counterattack, and the bayonet, grenade, and rifle all exerted their power, killing or wounding both enemy battalions, except for a few who escaped down the mountain. But the enraged enemy continued to attack with two regiments (lacking the two battalions that had been wiped out), and the fierce artillery fire made the mountain seem to be on fire. But the enemy dared not charge from the front again, and cunningly used a small number of troops to contain them in the front, while the main force detoured from the left and right sides. At this time, the Second Platoon's position had been defeated and lost, and the Third Platoon was surrounded on three sides, and the situation was extremely serious. Seeing that the enemy had rushed to the front, the soldiers raised their bayonets again. The enemies who had suffered the consequences dared not engage them in bayonet fighting, and a grenade landed right behind Comrade Zhang Xuezhi. Zhang Xuezhi quickly picked it up before it exploded and returned it to the enemy. The enemy really dared not advance in front of our soldiers' bayonets. At this time, Comrade Zhang Xuezhi's left arm was broken off at the root by the enemy, and the gun in his hand fell to the ground. Four enemies took the opportunity to rush up. Seeing that the bayonet was about to reach his chest, Zhang Xuezhi quickly pulled out the pistol from his waist and fired a series of shots, and the four enemies fell to the ground. At this time, there were only six people left in the whole platoon. After a fierce artillery fire, the enemy rushed up like a swarm, and a bayonet fight broke out on the position. In the situation where the enemy's strength was very different from ours, our people's iron soldiers fought the enemy until the last moment. Comrade Zhang Xuezhi, who was seriously injured in the buttocks and left arm, was stabbed twice in the face by the enemy, then stabbed in the stomach, and then thrown down the steep wall. But the ferocious enemy did not take his life. Comrade Zhang Xuezhi, who had fainted, slowly woke up again in the afternoon. "Don't let the enemy capture me alive! I would rather be killed by the enemy than run back!" He stood up reluctantly and finally crawled and rolled back to our army's position.
    When Comrade Zhang Xuezhi returned from the hospital, the entire division was carrying out the "Learn from Zhang Xuezhi's Bayonet Fighting Movement." He also learned that in the Battle of Babaoshan, he and his Third Platoon killed or wounded more than 700 enemies. He was named a Great Meritorious Hero by the division party committee and was praised as the "Bayonet Hero." This time, the corps and military region model hero meeting, he was also selected as a representative to attend the National Combat Heroes Conference.

　　拚刺英雄张学智
    姚文孚
    “拚刺英雄”张学智，原是人民解放军某部二连三排排长，今年二十四岁，出身于贫农家庭，个子不很高，但红红的面孔长得却挺“虎势”。
    张学智同志是光荣的共产党员，在每次战斗中都表现了对党对人民的无限忠诚。大小战斗打过五六十次，负伤五次，现在左臂残废。一九四六年大同战役因活捉敌坦克车，曾被评为“二等战斗英雄”。一九四八年八宝山战斗又荣获“拚刺英雄”的称号。
    一九四八年十月十一日，为了保卫石家庄，部队连夜赶到平绥路下花园至新保安段，执行破击任务。疯狂的敌人以三个军的兵力，也随后赶到，企图拖住我们的后腿阻止我们前进。十二日拂晓，敌人先开出铁甲车护路，并向我射击，根据这时的情况，只有把铁甲车破坏，才能使部队顺利执行破击任务。
    张学智完成了破坏铁甲车的这一艰巨任务。这时敌我只隔两个山头，匪徒企图强占南面山头制高点，阻止我部队于山口之外，并打算“一举歼灭”我军，于是开始从山背后往上爬。情况已趋紧张，强占山头制高点，已成为胜败的关键。全排跟敌人马上展开了爬山竞赛，很快的冲上了山腰。这时发现敌人也正往上冲，其先头部队已抢上山头。在这种情况下，如果表现丝毫畏惧或者稍一犹豫，即有遭受歼灭的危险。但张学智同志并没有犹豫和畏惧，趁敌人站脚未稳，敌后续部队还没上来，即发起猛冲。手榴弹排子枪一齐开火，一下子把敌人撵下山头，并马上向下冲杀。他几个箭步赶上去，连着用刺刀挑死了两个敌人。强占山头的战斗，匪军一个连除少数侥幸逃窜外，都被杀伤在山腰。但张学智所率领的三排却无一伤亡。
    营长命令二排上来接替，三排下去吃饭。张学智和他的战士们，刚刚吃了半顿，敌人又开始进攻了。于是全排马上丢下饭碗，接受了强占北面八宝山的战斗任务！张学智同志一面率领大家前进，一面提出口号：“同志们，争取爬山胜利，爬上去就是胜利，爬不上去就是死亡。”山高路陡，大家攀着树根扑着草，前推后拉的，很快的抢上了约四里高的八宝山顶。敌人以两个营的兵力，在猛烈炮火掩护下，向八宝山头展开了攻击，并以四门山炮向三排阵地齐轰，直砸的人抬不起头来。这时敌人已冲到山腰，张学智命令战士：“手榴弹准备好，要保持我们大功团钢铁第一营的光荣，坚守阵地！”喊声未落，一颗炮弹在身旁爆炸了，一块炮弹皮子从臀部打进去，血流下来。这时敌人先头部队两个连已冲上来，刚接近前沿，但张学智同志仍然坚持战斗，排子枪，手榴弹一齐开了火，三挺机枪也呱呱的叫起来，打得敌人滚的滚爬的爬。但敌人督战队又用大刀和机枪，逼着匪军冲了上来。张学智排又是一阵手榴弹。但敌人在督战队的威逼下仍继续往上冲。张学智见情势紧张，马上挺身而出站到最前面。他的臀部伤口的血，一劲顺着大腿往下流，腿有些发软，只好背靠着山石，端起刺刀等待敌人接近。这时两个敌人冲上，朝他猛刺过来，张学智同志马上拨开敌枪，紧接着一个“突刺”把一个敌人刺死！随即又很快的转过身来将第二个敌人刺死。等到又有四个敌人冲到和他平列起来时，张学智同志即以神速勇猛的动作，刺刀一顺，先挑死了一个。接着拔出刀来翻身一个劈刀，把第二个从左臂劈倒下去。这时第三个敌人趁机向他下部一枪刺来，他马上用一个“防下”动作，把敌枪拨开，从敌人右肋刺了进去。他趁胜又组织了反突击，刺刀、手榴弹和步枪一齐发挥威力，使敌人两个营除少数逃下山外，都被杀伤。但恼羞成怒的敌人，又用两个团的兵力（已缺被消灭的两个营）继续进攻，猛烈的炮火把山都打得着了火似的。可是敌人再不敢从正面冲了，狡猾的以少数兵力在正面牵制，主力分左右两侧迂回上来。这时二排阵地已经受挫丢失，三排三面受敌，情况万分严重。眼看敌人已冲到跟前，战士们又端起了刺刀。吃过苦头的敌人再也不敢和他们拚刺了，一个手榴弹正落在张学智同志的背后，张学智眼急手快，趁未爆炸，立即拾起来又回敬了敌人。敌人在我战士的刺刀面前实在不敢前进。这时张学智同志的左臂从根上被敌人打断了，手里的枪掉在地上，四个敌人趁空冲上，眼看刺刀就要达到他的胸前，张学智顺手拔出腰中的手枪，拍，拍，拍一梭连响，四个敌人应声倒地。这时全排只剩下六个人了。一阵激烈的炮火之后，敌人又一窝蜂似的冲了上来，阵地上响起了一片拚刺声。在敌我力量相差十分悬殊的情况下，我人民的钢铁战士，一直和敌人拚到最后一刻钟。臀部和左臂负重伤的张学智同志，脸上被敌刺了两下，随后又在肚子上被刺了一下，并被挑下陡壁去。但凶恶的敌人，并未夺去他的生命，摔昏的张学智同志，到下午又慢慢的苏醒过来。“不能让敌人捉活的！宁可让敌人打死也要跑回去！”他勉强地站起来，终于连爬带滚的回到我军阵地。
    当张学智同志从医院归来的时候，全师正开展着“向张学智学习拚刺的运动”。他并知道了八宝山的战斗，他和他的三排，共杀伤敌人七百多人；他被师党委评为大功功臣，并誉为“拚刺英雄”的称号。这次兵团暨军区英模会议，他又被评选为出席全国战斗英雄会议的代表。
