The Communist Youth League Beijing Municipal Committee Working Committee Office
The Work of the Communist Party Branch Should Be Rectified

Reader Opinions

Editor:

I am a member of the Communist Party of China, currently working at the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. Here, I would like to inform you of the general situation of the Party organization and work in our office over the past year and ask for your opinions.

The Party organization in our office is very unsound, organizational life is lax, and work is spontaneous. The branch and小组 meetings can be skipped for one or two months; and every time the Party organization is adjusted (due to changes in the administrative organization), it takes more than a month to complete the staffing. Therefore, the Party organization has not played its due role in the League Municipal Committee’s office. Although the branch committee participated in the work of the Learning Committee in leading the study of Party member cadres, it did not mobilize the organizational strength of the Party to form a core leadership for learning. Therefore, the entire study is "three days of fishing, two days of drying nets," very irregular. As for basic ideological education of the Party and criticism and self-criticism, they are even more lacking. It can almost be said that there is either complete harmony or mutual discord within the branch. It is rare to see anyone who can conduct mutual encouragement and criticism based on Party principles. An irresponsible attitude was also shown in handling the issue of probationary members becoming full members. In my case, I should have become a full member last November, but because the branch meeting could not be held, it was delayed until now to be resolved.

In my opinion, the main reason for these phenomena is that the guiding principles and tasks of the Party branch in the League Municipal Committee office are not clear. Neither the branch committee nor the members know what the Party should do in the office. How to do it? On the other hand, the branch committees also lack a sense of responsibility, using the excuse of being busy with work to relax their leadership over the branch work. This is especially true of the general branch. Whenever branch elections are held, they request the general branch to send people to participate in guidance, but the general branch committee members shirk their responsibilities and are unwilling to participate. It seems that they already consider this an extra burden. At the same time, the leadership of the higher-level Party committee is also insufficient, the tasks assigned are unclear, and there is a lack of timely and in-depth inspection. Therefore, the current situation of the Party organization in our office must be improved, especially as the League organization is expanding day by day, and there is an urgent need to strengthen the leading role of the Party. At present, the entire Party is carrying out a rectification movement, and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League has also issued instructions calling on League cadres at all levels who are separated from production and League member cadres in various offices to participate in the rectification, which requires strengthening and enriching the Party organization and its work in the League Municipal Committee office to lead the rectification movement of the League Municipal Committee.

Over the past year, comrades have repeatedly put forward opinions on improving the Party organization in our office, but this has not attracted sufficient attention from the leadership. This time, I hope that with the help of the Party newspaper, the situation of the Party organization in our office can be improved.

Yang ZhengYan

The Communist Youth League Beijing Municipal Committee Working Committee Office Communist Party General Branch's Self-criticism on Yang ZhengYan's Criticism

People's Daily:

Comrade Yang ZhengYan's criticism of us is basically correct. The shortcomings he pointed out do exist in the work of the branch of the Communist Youth League Beijing Municipal Committee Working Committee office. Over the past year and a half, thanks to the efforts of successive general branch committees, great improvements have been made in the work, but these problems have not been completely resolved. We conducted a review of our past work at the last two general branch committee meetings and found that the main shortcomings are in the following two aspects:

First, as Comrade Yang ZhengYan pointed out, due to the "unclear guiding principles and tasks of the Party branch in the League Municipal Committee office," we did not tightly grasp the basic link of carrying out Party work around administrative tasks. Therefore, the Party branch did not play its due role in the office. In April of this year, all Party members conducted a discussion on the issue of the tasks of the office branch during the re-election of the current general branch committee. The conclusion at the time was that the main task of the office branch is to play a guaranteeing role in completing administrative work. Based on this understanding, the general branch committee did not further study specific measures to specifically guarantee, that is, to formulate a half-year work plan, the main contents of which were: "Through study, regularization, Party membership, and other tasks, seize the opportunity at any time to conduct ideological education"; "The secretary, deputy secretary, and propaganda and education committee members participate in the office Learning Committee to strengthen the leadership of office learning"; "Regularly resolve accumulated organizational problems, improve the work of joining the Party and becoming a full member, and ensure timely resolution." Under this plan, many of the tasks carried out by the general branch, such as learning and ideological summaries, were naturally not sufficiently combined with administrative work. The branches mainly worked on joining the Party and becoming a full member. As for the ideological problems of individual comrades, criticism and self-criticism were carried out in a decentralized manner by the groups, and the leadership of the general branch and branches was very insufficient. As a result, comrades generally reflected that the organizational life was not good and the content was poor. Some groups felt that there were no problems to discuss and did not hold meetings for a long time. In July, the general branch committee reviewed the organizational life and found that the main problem was that it was not sufficiently combined with administrative work, and it did not "guarantee" administrative tasks from a positive aspect. Criticism and self-criticism remained in the circle of personal ideology and work style and did not rise to the level of policies and principles and work. At that time, it was proposed to strengthen the role of the groups and conduct criticism and self-criticism around administrative work. However, due to the lack of specific measures, the policy remained a slogan, so the situation has not improved in the past two months. Recently, a district committee instructed that the office Party branch has the right to make suggestions on administrative work. This made our understanding of how to guarantee administrative work more specific and clear. In the recent discussion of the general branch committee, we believe that the office Party branch can carry out the following two aspects of work in guaranteeing administrative tasks: 1. Regularly check the implementation of work by Party member comrades, conduct Party education, and cultivate their conscious work attitude to complete administrative tasks. 2. Organize and educate Party members to criticize and self-criticize bureaucracy in office work, improve work efficiency, and study the main problems in office work in a certain period, and make suggestions to the administration. For example, recently, individual departments in the office have reflected that tasks are unclear and work is not specific. The Party branch can collect the opinions of the comrades and submit them to the administration for resolution. This is the main problem in our work. If these two aspects of work are carried out well, the Party branch can play a certain role in the work of the League Municipal Committee office.

Second, Party member comrades in charge of administration did not care enough about and help with the branch work and did not regard the branch as an important reliance for completing work tasks. There were also shortcomings in the working style of the general branch committee, such as "lack of a sense of responsibility," which led to delays in work. The guiding principles and tasks of the Party general branch were unclear, but instead of actively studying, thinking of ways, going deep into the masses, and creating experience, we arranged according to this unclear concept and stopped at general appeals. The same is true for the handling of regularization and Party membership issues. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, there were new decisions on the development and consolidation of the Party, and it was difficult for us to grasp the standards for recruiting Party members. At that time, there were no specific instructions from the higher-level, which affected the development of the Party's work, but we did not clearly explain to comrades who had applied to join the Party several months or even a year ago. There was a backlog in the procedures from the group to the general branch, so there were still delays in joining the Party and becoming a full member. These are all wrong and should be overcome in the future. Otherwise, the correct policy will still not be implemented.

The League Municipal Committee will conduct rectification in October. In addition to helping the administration do a good job in this work, we will further improve the Party branch organization and work so that it can unite all Party members, League members, and the masses in the office and fight to complete the work tasks of the League Municipal Committee!

September 27, 1950

Editor's Note: On August 21, Communist Party member Yang ZhengYan criticized the work of the Communist Party branch of the Communist Youth League Beijing Municipal Committee Working Committee office. The Communist Party General Branch Committee of the League Municipal Committee accepted Comrade Yang ZhengYan's criticism and wrote a self-criticism report. The spirit of the Communist Party General Branch Committee of the Communist Youth League Beijing Municipal Committee Working Committee office in accepting Party member criticism and seriously reviewing work is good. The General Branch Committee believes that one of the main reasons for the loose Party organizational life and lack of principled spirit is that the branch's policy of guaranteeing administrative work is unclear. The office branch should guarantee the completion of administrative tasks. But what method should be used to guarantee it? The two methods proposed by the General Branch Committee of the League Municipal Committee are not enough. The most effective method should be the fourth item in the tasks of the branch in Chapter VI, Article 52 of the Constitution of the Communist Party of China: to educate Party members and organize Party members to study. Only by organizing Party members and non-Party cadres to study culture, theory, policy, and business can we effectively improve the Marxist-Leninist theoretical level and work efficiency of Party members and effectively guarantee the completion of administrative tasks of the office. Otherwise, the so-called guarantee of the completion of administrative tasks is likely to become empty talk. Therefore, the General Branch Committee of the League Municipal Committee office should regard organizing and leading learning as its primary task in accordance with the provisions of the Party Constitution. Secondly, the review mentioned that the General Branch Committee proposed to strengthen the role of the groups in July. This approach is inappropriate. Article 49 of Chapter VI of the Party Constitution stipulates that the Party's grassroots organization is the Party branch. Therefore, to improve organizational life and strengthen ideological leadership over Party members, we must start by strengthening the role of the branch, rather than treating the branch as a leading body and the group as a grassroots organization.

### 青年团北京市工委机关  中共支部工作应进行整理  读者意见

　　青年团北京市工委机关
    中共支部工作应进行整理
    读者意见编辑同志：
    我是中国共产党党员，现在中国新民主主义青年团北京市工作委员会工作。这里，我愿把一年来我们机关中党的组织与工作的大概情况告诉你们，请你们提出意见。
    我们机关的党的组织是很不健全的，组织生活松懈，工作自流，支部和小组可以一两个月不开会；并且每次党组织的调整（因为行政组织的变动），总得经过一个多月才能编制就绪。因而党的组织在团市工委的机关里并没有起到它应有的作用。虽然在对党员干部的学习领导上，支委参加了学委会的工作，但是并没有动员起党的组织力量形成学习的核心领导。因此整个的学习是“三天打鱼，两天晒网”，很不经常。至于党的基本思想教育和批评与自我批评，更是缺乏，几乎可以说，支部内不是一团和气，便是彼此闹意见，很少见到有人能够根据党的原则，进行相互的鼓励与批评。在处理候补党员转正问题上也表现了不负责任的态度。就我来说，本应于去年十一月转正，但因支部会开不起来，一直拖到现在才解决。
    产生这些现象的原因，据我看，主要是团市工委机关党的支部的方针任务不明确，不论支委或党员，都不知道党在机关里应该做什么。如何做？另一方面，也是各支委责任心不够，借口工作繁忙而放松了对支部的领导工作。特别是总支也是如此，每逢分支选举时，要求总支派人去参加指导，而总支委便互相推诿，不愿参加。似乎他们已认为这是一种额外负担。同时，上级党委领导也不够，布置任务不明确，更缺乏及时深入的检查。因此，我们机关中党组织的这种情况，必须加以改善，特别是团的组织一天天的在扩大，迫切要求党的领导作用的加强。目前全党正开展着整风运动，青年团中央也发布了指示，号召团的各级脱离生产的干部和各机关中的团员干部参加整风，这就更需要健全与充实团市工委机关中的党组织与它的工作，以领导团市工委的整风运动。
    一年来，同志们曾多次提出改善我们机关党组织的意见，但是并没有引起领导上的足够的注意。这一次希望在党报的帮助下，我们机关党组织的情况能得到改善。
          杨正彦
    青年团北京市工委机关中共总支对杨正彦批评的检讨人民日报：
    杨正彦同志对我们的批评基本上是正确的。他所指出的缺点在青年团北京市工作委员会机关支部的工作中确实存在着。一年半来，由于历届总支委员会的努力，工作虽有很大改进，但这些问题并未完全解决。我们在最近两次总支委员会上对过去工作进行了一次检查，发现主要缺点有下列两方面：
    第一，正如杨正彦同志所指出的，由于“团市工委机关党支部的方针任务不明确”，我们没有紧紧地抓住围绕行政任务来进行党的工作这一基本环节，因此党支部没有发挥在机关中应起的作用。今年四月，本届总支委改选时全体党员曾进行过机关支部任务问题的讨论。当时的结论是：机关支部的任务主要是在完成行政工作中起保证作用。根据这一了解，总支委员会并未进一步研究如何具体保证的具体办法，即制定了半年工作计划，主要内容为：“通过学习，转正、入党及其他各项工作，随时抓紧时机，进行思想教育”；“正、副书记及宣教委员参加机关学委会，以加强对机关学习的领导”；“定期解决积压的组织问题，改进入党转正工作，并保证及时解决”。在这个计划之下，总支所进行的许多工作，如学习、思想总结等，自然都和行政工作结合得不够。分支主要搞了入党转正工作。至于个别同志的思想问题，则由小组分散来进行批评和自我批评，总支和分支领导非常不够。这样做的结果，同志们普遍反映组织生活过得不好，内容贫乏，有的小组认为没有问题可谈，很长时期不开会。七月间总支委员会检查了组织生活，发现了主要的问题是结合行政工作不够，没有从积极的方面去“保证”了行政任务。批评与自我批评停留在个人思想作风的圈子里，没有提高到政策方针及工作上。当时提出了要加强小组的作用，围绕行政工作来进行批评与自我批评。但因缺少具体办法，方针停留在口号上，以致两个月来情况并未改善。最近一区区委指示：机关党支部对于行政工作有建议权。这点使我们对于如何保证行政工作的问题认识得更具体更明确了。在最近一次总支委员会的讨论中，我们认为机关党支部在保证行政任务中可以进行以下两方面的工作：一、随时检查党员同志执行工作的情况，进行党的教育，培养其以自觉的工作态度完成行政任务。二、组织与教育党员对机关工作中的官僚主义进行批评与自我批评，提高工作效率，并研究一定时期中机关工作中的主要问题，向行政上提出建议。例如：最近机关中个别部门有任务不明确，工作不具体的反映，党支部即可集中同志们的意见，提交行政上设法解决。这是我们工作中的主要问题。如果把这两方面的工作进行好了，将可使党支部在团市工委机关工作中发挥一定的作用。
    第二，在行政上负责的党员同志对支部工作关心帮助不够，没有把支部作为完成工作任务的重要依靠。在总支委员会的工作作风上也存在着“责任心不够”的缺点，以致工作有拖拉现象。党总支工作方针任务不明确，但我们不是积极地钻研、想办法，深入群众，创造经验，而是根据这个不明确的概念布置下去，而又停留在一般号召上。对转正入党问题的处理，也是一样。三中全会以后，党的发展和巩固问题有了新的决定，对于吸收党员的标准我们很难掌握，当时上级也没有具体指示，影响了发展党的工作，但是我们对几个月甚至一年前已经申请入党的同志却未交代清楚。在手续上由小组到总支均有积压现象，因此入党和转正工作仍有拖拉的现象。这些都是不对的，以后应该克服。不然，正确的方针还是无法贯彻的。
    十月内团市工委将进行整风。我们除了帮助行政搞好这一工作外，并将进一步健全党支部组织与工作，使它能团结起全机关党员、团员和群众，为完成团市工委的工作任务而斗争！
      青年团北京市工委会机关中共总支委员会
        一九五零年九月二十七日
    编者按：八月二十一日中共党员杨正彦对青年团北京工委会机关中共支部工作提出批评。团市工委中共总支委员会接受了杨正彦同志的批评，并写出了检查报告。青年团北京市工委会机关中共总支委员会接受党员批评，认真检查工作的精神是好的。总支委员会认为党内组织生活涣散、缺乏原则精神的主要原因之一是支部对保证行政工作的方针不明确。机关支部是应该保证行政任务的完成的。但是以什么方法保证呢？团市工委总支委员会所提出的两项办法还是不够的。最有效的办法应该是中国共产党党章第六章第五十二条支部的任务中第四项的规定：教育党员，组织党员的学习。只有通过组织党员及非党干部文化的理论的以及政策业务的学习，才能有效地提高党员的马列主义理论水平和工作效率，才能有效地保证机关行政工作任务的完成。否则，所谓保证行政任务完成就容易流为空谈。因而团市工委机关总支委员会应该根据党章规定，把组织领导学习当作自己的首要任务。其次，检讨中提到七月间总支委员会曾提出要加强小组的作用。这种作法是不恰当的。党章第六章第四十九条规定党的基层组织，是党的支部。因之健全组织生活加强对党员的思想领导，必须从加强支部的作用作起，而不应把支部当做领导机构、把小组当成基层组织。
