Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th.
The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army announced in a war report on the evening of the 6th that the People's Army units were conducting tenacious defensive battles on all fronts against the numerically superior enemy.

In the Munsan area north of Seoul, the People's Army inflicted heavy losses on the enemy attempting to cross the Imjin River and drove them back to the south bank of the Imjin River.

According to reliable information, from September 30th to October 5th, the People's Army anti-aircraft artillery units shot down 16 enemy planes in the areas of Pyongyang, Wonsan, Sunan, Anju, and Hwangju.

In the war of aggression against Korea, the American imperialists instigated and directly participated in the crimes of the Li Seung-man gang in slaughtering Korean patriotic people, while utilizing their superior air force to drop bombs on peaceful Korean residents, destroy non-military production factories, and massacre the elderly, women, and children. Even hospitals with clearly visible Red Cross symbols and Christian churches with prominent crosses have become targets for American bandit aircraft bombings.

On August 30th, American planes bombed Pyongyang, reducing the main part of the Pyongyang Tobacco Factory, the democratic propaganda room, the labor union hall, and the nurseries to ashes. Workers, seeing their factory burning in flames, felt infinite anger and rushed to rescue machinery and materials. At this time, American planes resumed strafing with machine guns. Patriotic Korean workers resolutely protected the factory under the bombing and strafing of enemy planes and immediately began repairs after the enemy planes bombed.

On the same day, American planes bombed the First Water Source of the Pyongyang Waterworks, continuously dropping bombs weighing 500 kilograms to one ton, burning down the water source buildings and killing or injuring four technicians. Han Bong-deok, the director of the waterworks, said, "We will never forget the atrocities of American imperialism, we will have revenge! We will quickly repair the facilities bombed and destroyed by the enemy, stabilize the lives of the citizens, and complete the great cause of the unification of the fatherland." Director Han Bong-deok's voice is the unyielding will of the Korean people to fight for independence and freedom. Korean workers not only responded to the brutal bombing of American planes with anger but also with practical actions to protect the factory.

On August 29th, American planes once again exposed their inhuman and ugly faces to the people of the world. They tore up the Geneva Convention and systematically dropped countless bombs on the hospital for the wounded and sick in Junghwa County, South Pyongan Province. The hospital had ten large Red Cross symbols in front, behind, and on both sides, which were very clear. More than ten American planes clearly saw them, but still dropped bombs. This atrocity destroyed the hospital buildings and killed three nurses.

On August 30th, American bandit planes continuously bombed the peaceful city of Nampo for as long as five hours, dropping over a thousand bombs, turning the industrial vocational school outside the city, the market inside the city, nurseries, and other places into a sea of ​​fire. The labor union hall used for citizens' gatherings was bombed into ruins. The children in the nursery were destroyed along with the houses! When Ms. Kim Sun-yeo was looking for her children, she saw children crying and looking for their mothers who had already been bombed to death. She hugged the children and said, "Okay, I will be your mother!" The children whose mothers were killed had mothers, and the mothers who lost their children treated other people's children as their own. In this way, Korean mothers and children formed a single entity to demand blood debts from American imperialism for killing and injuring peaceful people. The residents of Nampo City are unanimously burning with the determination to avenge their hatred.

On September 4th, American planes bombed the peaceful residential area of ​​West Pyongyang again, and the West Pyongyang Church, with its high tower and cross, was also destroyed, and many church members died. Ms. Lee Ho-joon, an 89-year-old church member, was killed right in front of the main entrance of the church. No matter how beautiful the rhetoric of the American representatives at the United Nations General Assembly, it cannot conceal the crimes of American planes in killing women and children, bombing schools, hospitals, and peaceful residential areas.

The people of Pyongyang were not intimidated by the atrocities of American planes. On the contrary, they participated in the battle more bravely. Kim Jun-mo, whose house and property were bombed by American planes, warned the shameless American aggressors, "Your beastly barbaric behavior has made us Korean people more united. We will drive out the aggressors! Our brave People's Army will surely avenge us!"

The Korean people are turning great anger into great strength and carrying out a heroic and protracted struggle against the barbaric enemy.

　　朝鲜人民化愤怒为力量
    反对美侵略者的残酷轰炸
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社平壤讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部六日晚发表战报称：人民军部队在各战线对数量上占优势的敌人，进行顽强的防御战。
    在汉城以北的汶山地区，人民军部队给予企图渡过临津江的敌人以巨大的损失，并将敌人击退至临津江南岸。
    据确实的情报，从九月三十日至十月五日，人民军高射炮部队在平壤、元山、顺安、安州、黄州等地区，击落敌机十六架。
    美国帝国主义者在侵略朝鲜战争中，指使并直接参加李承晚匪帮屠杀朝鲜爱国人民的罪行，一面利用其优势的空军。向朝鲜的和平居民投掷炸弹，破坏非军事生产的工厂，屠杀老人、妇女和儿童。甚至红十字标帜非常显明的病院，高悬十字架的基督教教堂，也都成了美国强盗飞机的轰炸对象。
    八月三十日，美机轰炸平壤，将平壤烟草工厂的主要部分、民主宣传室、劳动会馆和托儿所都炸成灰烬。工人们看见自己的工厂在火焰中燃烧，感到无限的愤恨，他们奋不顾身，抢救机器和材料。这时，美国飞机又复以机枪扫射。爱国的朝鲜工人在敌机的轰炸扫射下，坚决地保护着工厂，并在敌机轰炸后立即进行修复。
    同日，美国飞机又轰炸了平壤自来水事业所的第一水源地，连续投掷五百公斤至一吨重的炸弹，烧毁水源地建筑物并杀伤技术工人四名。自来水事业所所长韩凤德说：“我们永远不能忘掉美帝国主义的暴行，我们要复仇！我们要迅速修复被敌人轰炸破坏的设施，安定市民的生活，完成祖国统一的大业。”韩凤德所长的声音，就是朝鲜人民争独立争自由的不屈不挠的意志。朝鲜的工人不仅用愤怒而且用实际的护厂行动回答了美机的残暴轰炸。
    八月二十九日，美国飞机再一次的向全世界人民暴露了它的不人道的丑恶面目。它撕毁日内瓦协定，竟有计划地向平安南道中和县的伤病医院投了无数炸弹。而医院前后左右有十个大的红十字标帜，十分显明。美国十余架飞机明明看见，却仍然投弹。这一次暴行将病院的建筑物炸毁，并炸死三名看护人员。
    八月三十日，美国强盗飞机连续轰炸和平城市南浦达五小时之久，投下千余颗炸弹，将城外的工业专门学校、城内的市场、托儿所等地炸成一片火海。市民们集会用的劳动会馆炸成废墟。托儿所的孩子们和房子一起炸毁了！金顺汝女士，在寻找自己的孩子时，看到哭着寻找已经炸死的母亲的孩子们，她一把抱住孩子们，说：“好，我作你们的母亲吧！”被炸死母亲的孩子有了妈妈，失掉孩子的妈妈将别人的孩子当作自己的孩子。朝鲜的母亲和孩子就是这样的结成一个人似的要向美帝国主义讨还杀伤和平人民的血债。南浦市居民一致燃烧着报仇雪恨的决心。
    九月四日美机又轰炸西平壤的和平居民区，有着高塔和十字架的西平壤教会也被炸毁，许多教徒死难，八十九岁的老教友李浩遵女士正炸死在教堂的正门前面。联合国大会上美国代表任何漂亮的言辞，都不能掩饰美机残杀妇女儿童、轰炸学校医院及和平居民区的罪行。
    平壤的人民并没有为美机的暴行所吓倒，相反的，他们更英勇地参加了战斗。金俊模，房子和财产都被美机炸光了，向无耻的美国侵略者警告说：“你们的畜生般的野蛮行为，使我们朝鲜人民团结得更紧了。我们要驱逐侵略者！我们英勇的人民军一定会为我们报仇的！”
    朝鲜人民正把巨大的愤怒化成巨大的力量，向野蛮的敌人进行英勇的长期的斗争。
