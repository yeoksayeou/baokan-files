　　Xianyang Prefecture Completes Land Reform Preparations
    Prefecture Cadres Dispatched to Villages in Mid-October
    [Report from Xianyang, by our correspondent Feng Guiru] The preparations for land reform in Xianyang Prefecture, Shaanxi Province, have been successfully completed, and land reform is about to begin. After a year of work since the liberation of Xianyang Prefecture, conditions are basically in place for land reform. The entire prefecture comprises thirteen counties, ninety-four districts, and seven hundred and nineteen townships, with a total population of over 1.96 million. With the exception of a small number of old liberated areas where land reform has already been carried out, the remaining areas will undergo land reform after this autumn harvest.

    The entire prefecture has approximately eight million mu of cultivated land. Counties such as Tongchuan, Chunhua, and Xunyi have vast land and sparse populations, with an average of over five mu of land per person. The areas along the Wei River are densely populated with limited land. According to statistics from Xianyang and eleven other counties, there are a total of 746 landlords, owning over 150,000 mu of land, accounting for 2.4% of the total land area. Adding the public land such as temple land and clan land to be requisitioned and confiscated, it still does not exceed 5% of the total land area. More than half of the townships have no landlords.

    The entire region has over 150,000 members of peasant associations. The peasant association organizations in this prefecture are relatively pure, except in individual areas.

    The following preparatory work was carried out in the prefecture before the land reform: (1) Rectifying the ideology and work style of cadres. In addition to transferring 154 cadres to the Provincial Party Committee to participate in land reform studies, the prefecture also held land reform training classes, drawing over 1,300 cadres for study. In addition, prefecture and county-level cadres conducted more in-depth rectification studies, reviewing their work, ideology, and work style. District and township cadres did not undergo rectification studies, but class education was strengthened through various meetings, and land reform policies were specifically studied. (2) In coordination with the summer and autumn grain requisitions and rent reduction work, preliminary rectification was carried out on various grassroots organizations such as the Party, the Communist Youth League, peasant associations, militias, government, and public security in rural areas; the main problems were identified and resolved, land reform policy education was strengthened, and organizations were initially improved and purified. (3) Various meetings were successfully held. After the Prefectural Party Congress in early September, each county convened three-level cadre meetings, peasant representative conferences, and people's representative conferences from all walks of life; district and township levels convened peasant representative conferences, Party and Communist Youth League branch meetings, and mass meetings of various revolutionary organizations in rural areas. Through the above meetings, from top to bottom, from within the Party to outside the Party, policies were publicized, and land reform work was mobilized and deployed, so that cadres and the masses were ideologically and organizationally prepared. At these meetings, erroneous ideas such as some cadres believing that "there is not much to gain from not touching the rich peasants" and "land reform is not lively without fighting" were corrected. (4) In late September, the prefecture and counties all dispatched cadres to form work teams and piloted typical townships with different regional conditions in two or more areas. The time spent was generally twenty-five days.

    In addition, the prefecture concentrated its efforts to conduct a strict search and arrest of hidden bandits and special agents in some areas. Investigations were also conducted on the land ownership situation of various classes. Each county formulated practical land reform implementation plans and organized land reform committees and people's courts. The above preparations provided conditions for the smooth completion of land reform. The land reform work in the prefecture is planned to begin in mid-October this year and end entirely by the end of February next year. Cadres at the prefecture level who are preparing to participate in land reform were dispatched to the villages in mid-October. The second (and last) session of the land reform training class also officially ended on October 15th.

　　咸阳专区完成土改准备工作
    专区干部已于本月中旬下乡
    【本报咸阳讯】通讯员冯贵儒报道：陕西咸阳专区土地改革准备工作已顺利完成，土改工作即将开始。咸阳专区解放后，经过一年来的工作，已基本上具备了土地改革的条件。全专区共十三县、九十四个区、七百一十九个乡，共一百九十六万余人。除小部分老解放区已进行过土地改革外，其余地区将于今年秋后进行。
    全专区共有耕地约八百万亩。铜川、淳化、栒邑等县，地广人稀，每人平均土地五亩以上。渭河两岸，人稠地狭。据咸阳等十一县的统计，共有地主七百四十六户，占有土地十五万余亩，为土地总数的百分之二点四；加上应征收、没收的庙田、族田等公田，还不及土地总面积的百分之五。半数以上的乡没有地主。
    全区共有农会会员十五万余人。该专区农会组织，除个别地区外，均较纯洁。
    该专区在土地改革前已做好下列准备工作：（一）整顿干部思想作风。专区除调出一百五十四名干部至省委参加土改学习外，专区也举办了土改训练班，抽调了一千三百余名干部进行学习。此外专区、县级干部，进行了较为深入的整风学习，检查了工作，思想与作风。区、乡干部未进行整风学习，但经过各种会议，加强了阶级教育，并专门学习了土改政策。（二）配合夏征、秋征与减租等工作，对农村的党、团、农会、民兵、政权、治安等各种基层组织，进行了初步整顿；发现和解决了存在的主要问题，加强了土改政策教育，初步健全与纯洁了组织。（三）开好了各种会议。九月初专区党代会后，各县召开了三级干部会、农代会及各界人民代表会；区乡级召开了农代会、党团支部会，及农村各种革命组织的群众会议。经过以上会议，由上而下，由党内到党外，宣传政策，动员布置土地改革工作，使干部和群众在思想上和组织上有了准备。在这些会议上，纠正了某些干部认为“不动富农，油水不大”、“土改中不打不热闹”等错误思想。（四）九月下旬，专区和各县均抽调干部，组成工作组，试办了两个以上的不同地区情况的典型乡。时间一般为二十五天。
    此外，该专区并集中力量，对部分地区的潜藏匪特进行了严密搜捕。对各阶层土地占有情况，也进行了调查。各县制出了切合实际的土地改革实施方案，组织了土地改革委员会和人民法庭等组织。以上种种准备工作，给顺利完成土地改革提供了条件。该专区土地改革工作，计划由今年十月中旬开始至明年二月底全部结束。专区一级准备参加土地改革的干部，已于十月中旬下乡。土改训练班第二期（最后一期）也于十月十五日正式结束。
