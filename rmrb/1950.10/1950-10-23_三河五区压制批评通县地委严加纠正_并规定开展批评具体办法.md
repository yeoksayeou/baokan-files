Sanhe Fifth District Suppresses Criticism, Tongxian County Party Committee Strictly Corrects and Stipulates Specific Methods for Conducting Criticism

Comrades Editors:

On June 10th, Li Guangfeng, Deputy Propaganda Committee Member (not participating in the District Committee) and Meng Yuqi, Propaganda Cadre, of the Chinese Communist Party Committee of the Fifth District of Sanhe, Hebei (now划为 Fourth District), wrote a letter to the Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee criticizing the district for "lack of separation between Party and government" and "Party replacing the government." Before sending it out, Li and Meng submitted the original letter to Jin Xiang, Deputy Secretary of the District Committee, for review. Comrade Jin Xiang believed that these problems could be solved within the district itself and did not need to be sent out (meaning that family scandals should not be made public). However, the problem remained unsolved after four days. Li and Meng then sent the original manuscript to the Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee. This action of theirs was ridiculed by some comrades. For example, Zhao Henian, Deputy Minister of the Armed Forces Department of the district, said: "Stop talking nonsense, or I'll write another article about you!" Li and Meng had no choice but to request a branch meeting to resolve this issue. At the branch meeting, Zhao Henian, Deputy Minister of the Armed Forces Department of the district, said: "Criticism in the newspaper is more serious than probation within the Party!" Comrade Jin Xiang, Deputy Secretary of the District Committee, even considered this to be "an act of disorganization and indiscipline, and disobedience to the leadership of the District Committee." Li Yongning, Secretary of the County Party Committee, and Yin Wen, of the County Women's Federation, also believed that this was a manifestation of disobedience to the leadership of the District Committee. At the branch meeting, Meng Yuqi was made to admit his mistake (Li Guangfeng was absent that day). In mid-July, at a meeting held by the County Party Committee Propaganda Department, Meng Yuqi tearfully said to the county correspondent: "I dare not write any more articles. I'm already in enough trouble!" On August 28th, the Sanhe County Party Committee sent the original criticism manuscript and relevant materials to the Tongxian Prefectural Committee. The Fifth District Committee made a self-criticism on this matter. The County Party Committee also pointed out that Li and Meng's attitude of insisting on criticism was correct.

The occurrence of this incident fully demonstrates that some comrades in the district have not conducted in-depth study of the "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on April 19th, and therefore have engaged in this kind of egregious behavior of suppressing criticism. The decision clearly pointed out: "No one shall abuse their power to suppress criticism by worker-peasant correspondents in newspapers and publications, or retaliate against them." The Sanhe Fifth District Committee has precisely adopted this erroneous attitude.

In order to clarify the handling methods for criticism and self-criticism稿件 in the future, the Propaganda Department of the Tongxian County Party Committee specially re-stipulates:

1.  Party committees at all levels must not suppress articles related to criticism and self-criticism. If any discrepancies with the facts are discovered, or if there are other circumstances, a separate note with comments should be attached to the original manuscript and sent upwards.
2.  Regardless of whether a criticism article is published or not, the criticized party must not retaliate in any way or in any form, otherwise it is an act of violating discipline.
3.  After a criticism article is published in the newspaper, the criticized organization or individual must promptly make a factual reply. If any part or all of the criticism content is inconsistent with the facts, the criticized organization or individual has the right to make a statement, so as to carry out criticism and self-criticism in a pragmatic manner.

### 三河五区压制批评通县地委严加纠正  并规定开展批评具体办法

　　三河五区压制批评通县地委严加纠正
    并规定开展批评具体办法编者同志：
    六月十日，河北三河五区（现划为四区）中共区委副宣传委员（不参加区委）李广凤，宣传干事蒙玉起二同志，写了一封批评该区“党政不分”、“以党代政”的信给县委宣传部。发出前，李、蒙曾将原信交区委副书记金祥同志审阅。金祥同志认为这些问题可由区里自己解决，不需寄走（意即家丑不可外扬）。但过了四天问题仍未见解决。李、蒙二同志即将原稿送到县委宣传部。他们这一行动，竟遭到了某些同志的嘲笑。如区武装部副部长赵鹤年说：“少说怪话吧，不然又给你写稿！”李、蒙二同志无奈，乃要求召开支部大会，解决这个问题。支部大会上，区武装部副部长赵鹤年说：“在报纸上批评比留党察看还重呢！”区委副书记金祥同志更认为这是“无组织、无纪律的行为，不服从区委领导。”县委秘书李永宁、县妇联尹文二同志也认为这是不服从区委领导的表现。支部大会上让蒙玉起同志承认错误（李广凤同志当天不在）。七月中旬，在该县委宣传部召开的一次会议上，蒙玉起同志流着眼泪向该县通讯干事说：“我再也不敢写稿了，这下子还不够呛！”八月二十八日，三河县委将批评原稿及有关材料送到通县地委会。五区区委对此作了检讨。县委并指出李、蒙二同志，说坚持批评的态度是正确的。
    这一事件的发生，充分说明了该区尚有一些同志对中共中央四月十九日发布的“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”没有进行深入的学习，因之产生这种压制批评的恶劣行为。决定中曾明白地指出：“任何人不得滥用权力压制工农通讯员在报纸刊物上的批评，或加以报复。”而三河五区区委正是采取了这种错误的态度。
    为了明确今后有关批评与自我批评稿件的处理办法，中共通县地委特再重新规定：
    一、凡有关批评和自我批评的稿件，各级党委不得扣压。如发现与事实不符，或有其他情况，得另纸签注意见与原稿一并上寄。
    二、批评稿件不管发表与否，被批评者不得以任何借口、任何形式加以报复，否则即是违犯纪律的行为。
    三、批评稿件在报纸上发表后，被批评的机关或个人必须迅速做出实事求是的答复。批评内容若有部分或全部与事实不符，被批评的机关或个人有权声明，以便实事求是地展开批评与自我批评。
