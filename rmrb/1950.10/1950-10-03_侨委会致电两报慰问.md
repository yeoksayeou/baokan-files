Xinhua News Agency, 30th. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government has sent telegrams to the Singapore "Nanyang Siang Pau" and the Penang "Modern Daily News" to express condolences for the unreasonable closure of the two newspapers by the British colonial government. The telegram reads as follows:

To the comrades of the Singapore "Nanyang Siang Pau" and the Penang "Modern Daily News":

Your newspaper offices were unreasonably closed by the British colonial government on the 21st of this month, and the managers and editors of the two newspapers were arrested. This is an unfriendly act by the British colonial government towards the Chinese people. The British colonial government attempts to sever the ties between overseas Chinese and the motherland, so that overseas Chinese cannot hear about all the new democratic construction of the motherland. We firmly protest against the British colonial government's unreasonable act of stifling the overseas Chinese press and infringing upon the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese. We deeply admire your comrades' persistence in just struggle and their unyielding spirit. We send our condolences.

　　侨委会致电两报慰问
    【新华社三十日讯】中央人民政府华侨事务委员会，顷致电新加坡《南侨日报》和槟榔屿《现代日报》，对该二报被英国殖民政府无理封闭表示慰问。电文如下：
    新加坡《南侨日报》、槟榔屿《现代日报》诸同志：
    你们的报馆于本月二十一日同时被英国殖民政府无理封闭，并捕去两报经理编辑人员。这是英国殖民政府对我中国人民不友谊的行为。英国殖民政府企图隔断海外侨胞对祖国的联系，使祖国一切新民主主义的建设，不为海外侨胞所闻。英国殖民政府这种无理扼杀华侨言论机关，侵害华侨正当权益的行为，我们坚决抗议。诸同志坚持正义斗争，百折不挠，我们深为敬佩。谨电慰问。
    中央人民政府华侨事务委员会
    一九五○年九月二十七日
