　　Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative
    Focuses on Rationing Daily Necessities
    [This newspaper dispatch] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency: The Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative is focusing on rationing daily necessities in the suburbs, supplying the needs of rural cooperative members in a timely manner and at low prices, and promoting farmers' active participation in cooperatives. From September 14th to 23rd, when cloth and needles were tried out for rationing in Guanzhuang in the northern suburbs, 247 out of 253 cooperative members in Guanzhuang purchased the rationed goods. Each cooperative member could buy 10.92 Chinese feet of cloth and one package of needles. The rationed price of cloth averaged 2,000 yuan per Chinese foot, which was 800 yuan lower than the market price per Chinese foot. The price of each package of needles was also much cheaper than the market price, greatly reducing intermediate exploitation. During the nine days of rationing goods, farmers constantly requested to join the cooperative.
    There are more than 110,000 farmer cooperative members in the suburbs of Beijing, and they generally have a foundation of democratic organization. Therefore, the rationing work is carried out through village cooperatives and relying on cooperative member group leaders. At the beginning, the cooperative first convened directors, supervisors, and group leaders to report on the significance of rationing, the types, quantities, and prices of goods, and then the group leaders convened the cooperative members of their group to convey and register the information, and then notified each cooperative member to collect the goods at the village cooperative.

　　京市供销合作总社
    重点配售日用品
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处消息：京市供销合作总社在郊区重点配售日用品，及时地低价供应农村社员需要，促使农民积极参加合作社。九月十四日到二十三日，在北郊关庄试办布及针的配售时，关庄二五三个社员中，购买配售物品的就有二四七人。每个社员可以买到布头一○·九二尺，针一包。配售价格布平均二千元一尺，每尺较市价低八百元，针每包价亦比市价便宜很多，大大减少了中间剥削。在配售物品的九天中，不断有农民要求加入合作社。
    京郊各区共有农民社员十一万多人，一般都已有了民主组织的基础。因此，配售工作是通过村合作社和依靠社员小组长进行的。开始时，首先由合作社召集理监事及小组长，报告配售意义，货品种类、数量及价格，再由各小组长召集本小组社员，进行传达和登记，然后通知各社员到村社领货。
