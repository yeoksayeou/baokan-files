　　The Gratitude of the Turkmen People
    (Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic, Batuoluo Fu)

    On September 12th, the radio broadcast an inspiring new message nationwide.

    Due to the initiative of Comrade Stalin, the Soviet government passed a resolution to build the Turkmen Main Canal from the Amu Darya to Krasnovodsk, which will divert water to irrigate the southern regions of the Caspian Lowland in Western Turkmenistan, the lower reaches of the Amu Darya, and the western part of the Kara-Kum Desert.

    Every word and every clause of this historic resolution evokes a sense of well-deserved pride. The Turkmen Main Canal, with a total length of 1,100 kilometers – one of the great constructions of communism, an unprecedented hydraulic construction in human history!

    Seven years later, the mighty torrents of the Amu Darya will flow westward along the bed of the great canal, crossing the shifting sands of the Caspian Lowland, irrigating millions of hectares of land that are currently barren.

    All the Soviet people greeted the Soviet government's decision to build the Turkmen Main Canal with exceptional joy. The workers of the Turkmen Republic, in particular, greeted it with cheers and ecstasy. In various forums, gatherings, and congresses, the workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals of our motherland expressed their boundless gratitude to the Bolshevik Party and Comrade Stalin for their great concern for the further development and prosperity of the Turkmen Republic.

    Comrade Fulimuladuo Fu, Chairman of the "Communist Party Member" Collective Farm in the Maryysky District, said at the Collective Farm Congress:

    "Our hearts are filled with joy. How could we not be happy! For hundreds of years, our grandfathers and fathers longed for water, but they never found a way to obtain large quantities of it. Only the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet people led by Comrade Stalin have the ability to undertake such a huge construction project. In response to this concern, we will speed up the harvesting of cotton and complete the storage of cotton before the thirty-third anniversary of the Great October Revolution."

    At the Collective Farmers' Congress of the "Che Caiyueer" Agricultural Cooperative in the Kirov District, Comrade Sayunuo Fu said:

    "In a few years, the waters of the Amu Darya will flow to our border areas. These waters will fill the great canal, irrigating these now barren lands, and the dry lands will become fertile fields. We warmly thank the Party, the government, and Comrade Stalin for their constant concern for the people of our motherland, for our happiness and prosperity! Our heartfelt wishes for hundreds of years will be realized!"

    The longing for water has been the aspiration of the Turkmen people for centuries. Before the Great October Socialist Revolution, this heartfelt wish could not be realized. "Where there is land and water, the people are prosperous," as a Turkmen proverb says. However, the Turkmen people never had enough water, and even the little that existed was entirely in the hands of the Khans, landlords, and local tyrants before the revolution.

    Before the sixteenth century, the great Central Asian river, the Amu Darya, had two branches: the first branch, called the Araks, flowed into the Aral Sea; the other branch was the ancient Oxus River, which crossed the Kara-Kum and flowed into the Caspian Sea. The ruins of the ancient capital of Khorezm—Yurjan—Urgench city now stand on the banks of the Oxus River.

    The historian of Khorezm, King Abul-Ghazi-Beadur Khan, wrote:

    "From Urgench to Abul-Khan (Balkan), the road is lined with villages, because the Amu Darya passes under the walls of Urgench, flows east and slopes to the southwest, and then flows west until it enters the Mizandaran Sea near Ogurji. Both banks of the river up to Ogurji are densely populated with farmland, vineyards, and gardens."

    Other historians also pointed out that the Amu Darya changed its course after the Khans of Khorezm built dams to block it. The Khans attempted to subjugate the Turkmen people in the lower reaches of the Oxus River in this way.

    The Khans of Khorezm, holding water—what Turkmen proverbs call the "mother of harvest"—in their hands, cruelly oppressed the Turkmen people. In the records of the above-mentioned historian, we read: "...In 1061...we inherited our father's throne in Khorezm and managed state affairs. At the same time, the Turkmen people lived on the shores of Mangyshlak, Abul-Khan, and the Chezhen River. Those who lived in Khorezm, hearing of our arrival, fled to the three countries mentioned above. Ten years before I wrote this book, the Turkmen people were hostile to me. Therefore, I attacked them many times...from beginning to end, a total of 20,000 nobles and commoners died."

    As a result of the Kimak Khans blocking the Oxus River with dams and destructive attacks, the Turkmen people had to leave their accustomed lands and migrate to live as nomads near Turan. In this way, their economic and political development had to be restricted.

    However, the Turkmen people never stopped thinking about water and searching for ways to solve this urgent problem. At that time, the advanced people of the Turkmen nation saw that the only power that could help them in this matter was in Russia, in the Russian people. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, a representative of the Turkmen nation, Khoja Nepes, a captain from Mangyshlak, went to St. Petersburg to ask Peter the Great for help. He said, "The Amu Darya has been diverted into the Aral Sea. If the dam is dug open again, the river can return to its old riverbed. The Turkmen people request the help of the Russians in this matter." Peter the Great preliminarily examined Khoja Nepes's report and, in 1716, instructed Duke Bikovich-Cherkassky to "serve as a special envoy along that river to the Khan of Kimak, inspect the river and the dam along the way, and determine whether the river can return to its old course."

    The idea that the Amu Darya could flow through the Uzboy riverbed has always been alive in the hearts of our people. But the real realization was only possible after the Great October Revolution, under the Soviet regime. Only in the conditions of the Soviet social and state system, with the great help of the great Russian people and other nationalities in the brotherly united family of the Soviet Union—composed of equal Soviet nations—did the Turkmen workers begin a planned struggle to conquer nature. The Soviet government's decision on the construction of the Turkmen Main Canal is a new and brilliant manifestation of the vitality of Lenin-Stalin's national policy and the unbreakable friendship of the Soviet nationalities.

    The great Lenin once said that combating drought and irrigating the arid regions of Transcaucasia, the Volga River basin, and Central Asia were urgent and important tasks.

    "In order to improve agriculture and animal husbandry, irrigation is particularly important in any case," Lenin wrote in 1921: "...To rebuild the border areas and consolidate the road to socialism, irrigation is the most necessary transitional means."

    Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, under the leadership of the wise leader Comrade Stalin, the workers of Central Asia created dozens of irrigation systems in the years of peaceful construction, fundamentally reconstructing agriculture. In the initial years after the establishment of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic, a large amount of work was undertaken to build new canals and reconstruct irrigation systems. In Soviet Turkmenistan, the Basakhakarkinsky, Karabekaursky, and other canals have been built. These canals have given us thousands of hectares of new arable land, mainly cotton-producing land. Tens of thousands of water presses and ancient water pumps have been replaced by machine pumps and automatic irrigation equipment.

    All this has promoted the rapid rise of cotton production in the republic. Collective farms and state farms, relying on powerful water conservancy facilities, have been able to fight to increase harvests and increase cotton fields. The output of cotton and other crops has expanded several times. New pastures have also greatly increased animal husbandry. From 1934 to 1939, the number of livestock in collective farm pastures increased more than threefold, and in the last ten years, the number of public livestock has almost tripled again.

    These measures have ensured the great development of the national economy of Turkmenistan and created the conditions for the republic to completely change nature. Kara-Kum occupies almost nine-tenths of the area of Turkmenistan. The particularity of the local soil and plants makes it fully possible to develop animal husbandry and expand cotton planting land.

    The lack of sufficient irrigation water seriously hinders the growth of cotton production. The only source of irrigation water is the Amu Darya. The construction of the Turkmen Main Canal—an organizational part of Stalin's plan to transform nature—fundamentally solves this problem. Lush pastures and fields, gardens and forests will appear on the expanded ground of the canal area.

    A pleasant and beautiful prospect! The distance to this prospect is not long decades, but only a short seven years. For the happiness of mankind, the great plan to transform nature will be realized by the Soviet people themselves before our eyes.

    "What Stalin says will definitely succeed,"—the people all say this, and the workers and collective farmers of Turkmenistan also say this, and they call the names of the great leader, the wise mentor, the dear father and friend with infinite gratitude and pride.

    The significance of the Turkmen Main Canal in the national economy is immeasurable. The construction of the canal can solve the most important problem of expanding cotton production. The new land irrigated in the Caspian Lowland of Western Turkmenistan and the northern region of the republic, as well as the definite guarantee of irrigation for existing cultivated land, make it possible for cotton production in the Turkmen Republic to expand seven or eight times.

    The irrigation of seven million hectares of new pasture land in the Turkmen Main Canal area can provide a consolidated feed base, further develop livestock in collective farms and state farms, especially the precious Karakul sheep breed.

    The canal can fully guarantee drinking and technical water for socialist cities, enterprises in Western Turkmenistan, and railway transportation. The shortage of water in these rich industrial areas has long restricted the development of oil, coal, and chemical raw material mining. Krasnovodsk, Nebit-Dag, Kara-Bogaz-Gol, and Cheleken will have greater and faster development possibilities.

    The two cities of Nebit-Dag and Krasnovodsk will be decorated with parks and gardens. Orchards and grapes will be planted around workers' residences. Newly built sanatoriums and rest palaces will guarantee the laborers a healthy and cultural rest.

    An important part of agriculture in the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic is sericulture. Along the Turkmen Main Canal and various irrigation canals, along the borders of newly irrigated land, and around cities and industrial centers—the total area of protective forests will reach 500,000 hectares.

    In terms of forest planting, mulberry trees will account for the majority, which can greatly expand the feed base for sericulture and at least expand the production of silkworm cocoons sixfold.

    The realization of the construction of the Turkmen Main Canal can awaken the new development of the republic's productive forces and promote the further improvement of the cultural and material happiness of the workers.

    The party organization of the republic has accepted the government's resolution to build the Turkmen Main Canal, this battle's Stalin program, with all its activities.

    The party organization of Turkmenistan is mobilizing all the workers of the republic to fight selflessly for the timely and exemplary completion of Stalin's task.

    The workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic will do everything possible to complete the Turkmen Main Canal within the stipulated time.

    Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the great leader of the world's workers, the Soviet people, a creatively heroic people, are constantly consolidating the power of their beloved Soviet motherland, and moving forward with confidence towards the brilliant peak of communism.

    The giant hydroelectric station on the Volga River and the construction of the Turkmen Main Canal are outstanding new victories in the peaceful and creative labor of the Soviet people who are building communism. (Translated by Jun Qiang from the September 14th issue of Truth Daily)

### 土库曼人民的感谢

　　土库曼人民的感谢
    （土库曼苏维埃社会主义共和国共产党（布）中央委员会书记
  巴推罗夫）
    九月十二日，无线电向全国广播了令人感奋的新消息。
    由于斯大林同志的发起，苏联政府通过了建筑自阿姆河至克拉斯诺沃斯克的土库曼大运河的决议，这条大运河将引水灌溉西土库曼里海低地南部各区、阿姆河下流及卡拉·库姆沙漠的西部。
    这个历史性决议的每一个字、每一条文，都在引起正当的骄傲感。土库曼大运河全长达一千一百公里——共产主义伟大的建筑之一，人类历史上空前的水利建筑！
    七年以后，阿姆河的滚滚巨流将沿着伟大的运河河床奔向西方，穿过里海低地的流沙，使目前还是荒芜着的数百万公顷土地受到灌溉。
    全体苏维埃人民异常欣喜地迎接苏联政府关于建筑土库曼大运河的决定。土库曼共和国的劳动者们，特别以欢呼与狂喜来迎接它。在各座谈会、集会和大会中，我们祖国的工人、集体农民与知识分子，对布尔塞维克党和斯大林同志表示无限的感谢，为了他们对土库曼共和国进一步的发展与繁荣的伟大关怀。
    玛雷斯基区“共产党员”集体农场主席伏里木拉朵夫同志，在集体农场大会上说道：
    “我们充满着快乐的心情。怎么能不快乐呢！我们的祖父和父亲，几百年来想望着水，但是一直没有办法能够使他们得到大量的水。只有布尔塞维克党与斯大林同志所领导的苏联人民，才有能力担当这样巨大的建筑事业。为了回答这种关怀，我们要提高收获棉花的速度，要在伟大的十月革命节三十三周年前完成棉花的贮藏。”
    在基洛夫区农业组合“切才约尔”的集体农民大会上，萨尤诺夫同志说道：
    “几年之后，阿姆河的水即要流到我们边区来了。这些水充满了大运河，灌溉这些现在荒芜着的土地，干燥的土地将要变成肥沃的田野。我们热烈地感谢党、政府和斯大林同志对我们祖国的人民、我们的幸福和繁荣的不断关怀！我们数百年来衷心的愿望将要实现了！”
    对于水的憧憬，正是土库曼人民数世纪来的愿望。伟大的十月社会主义革命前，这个衷心的愿望不能实现。“那儿又有土地又有水，那儿的人民就富裕。”土库曼人的谚语是这样说的。但是，土库曼人民从未有过足够的水量，就是仅有的一些水，在革命前也全部掌握在可汗、地主和土豪的手里。
    十六世纪以前，中亚细亚的大河——阿姆河有两条支流：第一条支流名叫阿拉克斯，注入咸海；另一支流是古代的奥克斯河，横断卡拉·库姆而注入里海。奥克斯河岸现在有着古代霍瑞兹姆——约尔扎尼亚的首都乌尔恒奇城的遗迹。
    霍瑞兹姆的历史家、国王阿布尔——加兹——别都尔汗曾写道：
    “从乌尔恒奇到阿布尔汗（巴尔汗），一路上全是村庄，因为阿姆河经过乌尔恒奇的城脚，流向东面山坡转向西南后，又一直西流，在奥古尔齐附近注入米赞达蓝海。该河两岸直至奥古尔齐都是密集的耕地、葡萄园和花园。”
    别的历史学家们也指出，阿姆河是在霍瑞兹姆可汗筑堤阻断以后改了道的。可汗企图着这样使奥克斯河下流的土库曼民族从属自己。
    霍瑞兹姆的可汗们，将水——土库曼谚语中所称的“收获之母”——掌握在自己手里，残酷地压迫土库曼民族。在上面谈到的那历史学家的记录中，我们读到：“……一○六一年……我们在霍瑞兹姆承继了父亲的王座，管理国家事业。同时土库曼人住在曼吉什拉克、阿布尔汗和切真河两岸。那些住在霍瑞兹姆的人们，听得我们来到，即跑到上面谈到的三个国家去。在我写这本书的十年以前，土库曼人与我是敌对的。因此我向他们袭击了许多次……从开始到结束共死亡了两万贵族与平民。”
    由于基美的可汗们用堤阻断奥克斯河与破坏性袭击的结果，土库曼人不得不离开住惯了的土地而移居到土兰附近过着游牧生活。这样他们经济及政治的发展不得不受到束缚了。
    但是，土库曼人从未停止对水的想念，停止寻找解决这一迫切问题的途径。当时土库曼民族中先进的人们即看到了这件事上唯一可以帮助他们的力量，是在俄国，在俄罗斯人民。十八世纪初，土库曼民族的代表，玛吉什拉克的一个队长霍扎·涅彼斯到彼得堡去请求彼得大帝帮助。他说：“阿姆河被引到咸海中去了，如果再把堤掘开，就可使河流回到旧河床来，这件事土库曼人要求俄国人帮助”。彼得大帝初步审查了霍扎·涅彼斯的报告，便于一七一六年训令彼可维奇·查尔卡斯基公爵“充任专使沿那条河到基美的可汗那里去，沿途视察河流及河堤，查明该河是否可以重回旧道。”
    阿姆河可以流过乌兹包依河床这一个思想，是在我们人民的心里经常活着的。但是真正的实现只有在伟大的十月革命以后，在苏维埃政权之下，才有可能。只有在苏维埃社会与国家制度的条件中，在伟大的俄罗斯人民与苏联——各苏维埃平等民族所组成的兄弟般团结的大家庭——其他各民族的巨大帮助下，土库曼的劳动者们才开始有计划的征服自然的斗争。苏联政府关于建筑土库曼大运河的决议，是列宁——斯大林民族政策的生命力与苏联各民族牢不可破的友谊的新的光辉的表现。
    伟大的列宁曾说过，与旱灾斗争，引水灌溉外高加索，伏尔加河流域及中亚细亚的干燥区域，是迫切而重要的任务。
    “为了提高农业及牧畜业，无论如何，灌溉是特别重要的”，列宁在一九二一年写道：“……要重建边区，巩固走向社会主义的道路，灌溉是最必要的过渡手段”。
    在布尔塞维克党领导之下，在英明的领袖斯大林同志领导之下，中亚细亚的劳动者们在和平建设的年代里创建了数十个灌溉系统，根本上重建了农业。在土库曼苏维埃社会主义共和国成立后的最初几年，即展开了建筑新运河及重建灌溉系统的大量工作。在苏维埃的土库曼斯坦，已建起了巴萨哈卡尔金斯基、卡拉别卡乌里斯基及其他运河。这些运河使我们获得了数千公顷新耕地，主要是产棉地。数以万计的压水机和古老的抽水器都换成了机器唧筒和自动的灌溉设备。
    这一切促使共和国的产棉量很快地高涨起来。集体农场和国营农场靠着有力的水利设备，得以进行提高收获及增加棉田的斗争。棉花及其他作物的产量已扩大了数倍。新牧场也使得牧畜业大大增长了。以一九三四年至一九三九年，集体农场牧场中牲畜的头数增加了三倍有余，而在最近十年，公共牲畜的头数又几乎增加了三倍。
    这些措施保证了土库曼斯坦国民经济的巨大发展，还创造了共和国完全改变自然的条件。卡拉、库姆几乎占土库曼斯坦面积十分之九。当地的土壤的特殊性和植物是有发展牧畜业和扩展植棉地的充分可能性的。
    缺乏灌溉用的充足水量，严重地阻碍了棉产的增长。灌溉用水的唯一泉源即是阿姆河。土库曼大运河的建筑——斯大林改造自然计划的一个组织部分——根本上解决了这个问题。繁茂的牧地和田野，花园和树林，将在运河区的扩大地面上出现。
    愉快的、优美的远景！距这个远景不是长长的数十年，只是短短的七年。为了人类的幸福，改造自然的伟大计划，将在我们面前由苏维埃人亲手予以实现。
    “斯大林说过的——就一定成功”，——人民都这样说，土库曼的工人与集体农民也这样说，他们都以无限的感谢与骄傲呼唤伟大的领袖，英明的导师，亲爱的父亲和朋友的名字。
    土库曼大运河在国民经济方面的意义是不可计量的。运河的建造可以解决扩大棉花生产的最重要问题。在西土库曼的里海低地及共和国北部区域获得灌溉的新土地，以及对现有耕地的灌溉的确切保证，均使土库曼共和国棉产获得了扩大七、八倍的可能性。
    土库曼大运河区域新牧场七百万公顷土地的灌溉，可以提供巩固的饲料基地，进一步发展集体农场与国营农场的牲畜，尤其是珍贵的卡拉库里羊种。
    运河可以充分地保证社会主义城市、西土库曼的企业及铁路运输上的饮用水和技术用水。这些丰富的工业区用水的不足，长时期束缚了石油、煤与化学工业原料开采的发展。克拉斯诺沃斯克，涅彼特——达哥，卡拉——保加兹——果尔，切列金都会获得更大更快的发展可能。
    涅彼特——达哥和克拉斯诺沃斯克两城市将有公园和花园装饰起来。工人住宅的周围将要种植果园和葡萄。新建的疗养院和休息宫将保证劳动者有健康的和文化的休息。
    在土库曼苏维埃社会主义共和国农业中的一个重要部分是养蚕业。沿土库曼大运河及各灌溉运河，沿新灌溉土地的边界，城市及工业中心的周围——防护林的总面积，将达五十万公顷。
    在树林的种植方面，桑树将占绝大部分，这样可以大大扩展养蚕业的饲料基地，至少可使蚕茧的生产扩大六倍。
    土库曼大运河建筑的实现，可以唤起共和国生产力壮大的新发展，促使劳动者的文化的和物质的幸福进一步提高。
    共和国的党组织以全部活动接受了政府建筑土库曼大运河这一战斗的斯大林纲领的决议。
    土库曼的党组织正在动员共和国的全体劳动者忘我地为争取适时地并模范地完成斯大林的任务而奋斗。
    土库曼苏维埃社会主义共和国的工人、集体农民和知识分子，将尽一切努力，在规定时间内完成土库曼大运河。
    在布尔塞维克党的领导下，在全世界劳动者的伟大领袖斯大林同志的领导下，苏维埃人民，富有创造性的英勇的人民不断地巩固着自己亲爱的苏维埃祖国的威力，满怀信心地前进，走向共产主义的光辉的高峰。
    伏尔加河上巨大的水电站与土库曼大运河的建筑，是正在建设共产主义的苏联人民的和平创造性劳动的卓越的新胜利。（君强译自九月十四日真理报）
