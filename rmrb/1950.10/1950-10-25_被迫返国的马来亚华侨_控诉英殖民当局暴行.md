　　Overseas Chinese from Malaya Forced to Return Home
    Accuse British Colonial Authorities of Atrocities
    [Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 24th] Under the unreasonable persecution of the British colonial authorities in Malaya, a large number of overseas Chinese were forced to return to China. On October 9th, 1,291 overseas Chinese from various parts of Malaya arrived in Shantou by ship, many of whom were forced to return home due to being subjected to torture. They received condolences and care from the Shantou Municipal Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau and the Returned Overseas Chinese Association.
    The overseas Chinese compatriots who were forced to return to the motherland have successively accused the British colonial government of Malaya of atrocities against overseas Chinese. The elderly overseas Chinese Luo Xiong, who lived in the Kedah area near Penang, was forced to relocate because the British colonial government considered the area to be a guerrilla area; Luo Xiong lived by growing vegetables in the area, and his houses and properties were burned down by the British army, and he was once detained. Overseas Chinese in Jihebu also suffered the same persecution. Li Hang was driven out of the country after watching the property he had accumulated over the years with his blood and sweat being burned down by the British army, and could not find a guarantor to settle elsewhere.
    Female overseas Chinese Chen Yaxiang accused: British colonists in Malaya arbitrarily shot and killed overseas Chinese who cut rubber, and overseas Chinese had to register with the colonial government when they went out. Elementary school teacher Wang Lihui was arrested as many as four times because a leaflet was found in the school.
    The returned overseas Chinese expressed their indignation at the unreasonable measures taken by the British colonial government in Malaya to close the *Nanyang Siang Pau* and *Modern Daily*.

　　被迫返国的马来亚华侨
    控诉英殖民当局暴行
    【新华社广州二十四日电】在马来亚英国殖民当局的无理迫害下，大批华侨被迫回国。十月九日，马来亚各地华侨一千二百九十一人，乘轮返抵汕头，其中不少是因遭受残害而被迫回国。他们受到汕头市侨务局和归侨联合会的慰问照顾。
    被迫返抵祖国的侨胞纷纷控诉马来亚英殖民政府对华侨的暴行。住在槟榔屿附近吉打地区的年老华侨罗雄，因为英殖民政府认为该地是游击队出没的地带而被迫迁移；罗雄在该地以种菜为生，他的房屋财产被英军烧光后，曾被扣押过。吉禾埠的华侨也遭到同样的迫害。李航就是在眼睁睁地看着历年用血汗积累的财物被英军烧光后，又找不到在别处安居的担保而被驱逐出境的。
    女侨胞陈亚香控诉说：马来亚英国殖民者随意枪杀割橡胶的华侨，华侨出门要向殖民政府登记。小学教师王陆惠因学校中发现一张传单就被拘捕达四次之多。
    回国的侨胞对马来亚英殖民政府封闭《南侨日报》和《现代日报》的无理措施表示愤慨。
