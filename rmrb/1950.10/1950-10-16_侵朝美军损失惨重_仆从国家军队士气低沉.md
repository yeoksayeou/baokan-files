Xinhua News Agency, October 15th: The American imperialist invading army has suffered heavy losses in the Korean War, which even U.S. Defense Secretary Marshall cannot conceal. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 7th, Marshall said in a speech to the U.S. Mayors' Conference that to replenish the troops fighting in Korea, the United States would have to mobilize all of its forces. Marshall admitted the U.S. faced difficulties with its troop supply, "lacking trained reserve manpower."

Therefore, American imperialism is intensifying its pressure on various puppet states to send troops. In addition to the British and Australian armies, a Philippine battalion has recently arrived on the Korean battlefield. The vanguard of a Thai battalion has also arrived in Japan. However, the morale of these armies is low. According to a Central News Agency dispatch quoting the Manila Times, the Philippine troops are "mostly suffering from the flu," and the Thai troops "have expressed concern about the approaching cold winter" (Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, October 13th).

　　侵朝美军损失惨重
    仆从国家军队士气低沉
    【新华社十五日讯】美国帝国主义侵略军在朝鲜战争中损失重大，连美国国防部长马歇尔也无法加以掩饰。据美联社华盛顿七日讯：马歇尔在向美国市长会议发表的谈话中说：要补足在朝鲜作战的部队，就必须现在把美国的军队调光。马歇尔承认美国兵源困难，“缺乏有训练的后备人力”。
    因此，美国帝国主义正加紧压迫各仆从国家出兵。除英、澳军队外，最近抵达朝鲜战场的又有菲律宾军一个营。泰军一个营的先头部队也已到达日本。但是这些军队士气低沉。据国民党中央社电引《马尼拉时报》消息：菲军“多患流行性感冒”，泰军“对即将来临的严寒的冬季曾经表示忧虑”（法新社东京十三日讯）。
