　　Consolidating the Revolutionary Order and Suppressing Counter-Revolutionary Elements:
    Tianjin Executes Four Arch-Criminal Spies Including Zhang Xiangwen
    Public Trial and Verdict Announced, Receiving Broad Mass Support
    [Our Newspaper's Report] According to the Tianjin Daily, the case of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit spy organization "Hebei-Rehe-Suiyuan Youth Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Pingjin Headquarters," which was cracked by the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau in April this year, has been concluded after months of investigation. The Tianjin Municipal People's Procuratorate then filed a public prosecution with the Military Control Commission Military Court against the principal offenders Zhang Xiangwen, Xing Yuting, Wang Zhimin, and Li Fuxing, based on their crimes. The Military Court conducted a public trial on October 19th, sentenced them to death, and executed them by firing squad on the same day.
    The "Hebei-Rehe-Suiyuan Youth Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Pingjin Headquarters" counter-revolutionary spy organization was formed in November of last year by bandit criminals such as Zhang Xiangwen and Xing Yuting, and was led by Zhang Qingen, deputy director of the Kuomintang spy agency "Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Interior" and a key figure of the Central Statistics Bureau. Bandits Zhang and Xing infiltrated Tianjin in October of last year to carry out reactionary activities, successively developing over 60 bandit spies, with the principal offenders Zhang Xiangwen, Xing Yuting, and Wang Zhimin determining personnel positions and titles. Bandit Zhang appointed himself "Lieutenant General Commander-in-Chief," establishing departments such as the General Staff, Logistics, Adjutant, Political Propaganda, and three columns, as well as communication and liaison agencies, and drafting a reactionary military establishment program. They attempted to carry out activities in Beijing, Tianjin, the Beijing-Tianjin suburbs, and the Caiyu Town area of Daxing County, vigorously recruiting bandits, local bullies, ruffians, vagrants, scattered soldiers, remnant bandits and spies, and landlords who had been struggled against, in order to sabotage the various measures of our People's Government and local public security. The bandits had forged official seals, issued reactionary leaflets twice, spreading rumors that "200,000 troops are fully equipped in Hebei, Rehe, and Suiyuan," attempting to incite the masses to resist the People's Government. In addition, they planned to use the area south of Beijing as a "guerrilla warfare base," to rob our local cadres and militiamen of their guns, expand reactionary armed forces, and select ten bandit spies to form an assassination group, plotting to assassinate our senior leaders. In early April, they also planned to print counterfeit banknotes to disrupt the financial system and solve the funding for their sabotage activities. Furthermore, under the guise of Chiang Kai-shek's "underground workers," they drafted letters of extortion, demanding that the Deqing Yongda firm "provide financial assistance," affecting the safety of the people's lives. After the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau learned of this, it cracked the case in one fell swoop on April 17th of this year, arresting 45 principal and accessory offenders on the spot, including the bandit commander-in-chief, column commanders, detachment commanders, radio operators, and other key figures, Zhang Xiangwen, Xing Yuting, Wang Zhimin, Li Fuxing, Zhang Yusheng, Chen Wanfa, Chu Mengqi, and others; seizing a radio, two official seals, and multiple reactionary propaganda materials. Over the past few months, the Tianjin Public Security Bureau has conducted a detailed investigation and interrogation of this case. During the investigation, the bandit criminals attempted to evade their crimes, but ultimately had to confess due to the conclusive evidence. On the 19th of this month, the Tianjin Military Control Commission Military Court, based on the Tianjin Municipal People's Procuratorate's indictment against the four criminals Zhang Xiangwen, Xing Yuting, Wang Zhimin, and Li Fuxing, held a public trial in the Grand Court of the Tianjin Municipal People's Court, and, in accordance with Articles 2 and 4 of the State Council and People's Court's "Instructions on Suppressing Counter-Revolutionary Activities" of July 23rd of this year, sentenced the principal offenders Zhang Xiangwen and the other three to death. When this verdict was announced, it received enthusiastic support from the broad masses, with applause lasting for a long time, and slogans such as "Resolutely suppress spies!" and "Support the government's correct verdict!" resonating inside and outside the courtroom. The other 41 accessory offenders, Xing Yuqi, Zhang Yusheng, and others, will be prosecuted separately based on their crimes.
    Note: The principal offender, bandit Zhang Xiangwen, was 39 years old, from Tong County, Hebei. He came from the old Northwest Army, served as a deputy regimental commander under Yan Xishan's bandit forces, and during the Japanese puppet era, served as a squad leader of the Tong County puppet security team and a colonel director of the Tangshan office of the traitor Hao Pengju. After the Japanese surrender, he joined the "Lishi Society" in Nanjing and served as a supervisor at the US consulate in Nanjing. He then served as a lieutenant colonel deputy brigade commander of the Third Road Protection Brigade of the Fifth Regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's vanguard army in the Zhaidang district. Since "August 15th," he had colluded with Chiang Kai-shek's spy Guo Can. After the liberation of Tianjin, in November 1949, he accepted Guo's order to establish a reactionary organization, serving as the "Lieutenant General Commander-in-Chief" of the organization.
    Bandit Xing Yuting, from Ningjin County, Hebei, was a ruffian by origin. After "August 15th," he served as an adjutant follower under Guo Can, and was Guo's trusted henchman. In 1947, he joined the Chiang Kai-shek party's Central Statistics Bureau spy organization, serving as a special correspondent under Hu Wensheng, director of the Sixth Sub-station in the Tianjin district. When Guo Can accepted the Chiang Kai-shek internal adjustment bureau's task of going underground, he discussed with the bandit Xing the organization of reactionary armed forces.
    Bandit Wang Zhimin, 39 years old, from Anci County, Hebei, joined Yan's Third Army in 1928 as a captain adjutant. After retiring in 1930, he opened a brothel. After "August 15th," he served as the chief of the investigation and interrogation section of the Qiqihar Railway Protection Army of the Northeast Railway Bureau. In November 1949, he joined Zhang Xiangwen's reactionary organization, serving as the commander of the Second Column and Major General Chief of Staff.
    Bandit Li Fuxing was from Wuqing County, Hebei, 34 years old. In 1946, he served as a member of the Tianjin puppet police general team, and later transferred to the traffic team of the First Sub-bureau of the First Branch Station. After liberation, he was retained by the Tianjin Public Security Bureau. In January of this year, he was introduced by Wang Zhimin to join Zhang Xiangwen's reactionary organization, serving as a major battalion commander, using his current position as cover to develop a spy organization within the public security department.
