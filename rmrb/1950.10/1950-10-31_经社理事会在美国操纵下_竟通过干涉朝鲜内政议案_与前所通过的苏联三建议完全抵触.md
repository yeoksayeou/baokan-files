Xinhua News Agency, New York, Thirtieth Dispatch: The United Nations Economic and Social Council concluded its discussion on the general principles of assistance to Korea on the 26th.

The meeting on the 25th passed the Soviet proposal that representatives of Korea should participate in the organization of assistance to Korea. The Economic and Social Council had previously passed two Soviet proposals regarding the principle of not using assistance to interfere in Korea's internal affairs and the principle of distributing aid.

Although the representatives of the U.S.-British bloc did not dare to openly oppose the Soviet proposals to safeguard the interests of the Korean people in order to cover up their conspiracy, their true colors were finally exposed by the proposal put forward by the United States at the meeting on the 25th. The U.S. proposal suggested that the Council pass a resolution that Korea should implement clear economic and fiscal policies domestically. The representatives of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Poland opposed the U.S. proposal. Soviet representative Yarujian pointed out that the U.S. proposal would allow foreign countries to use assistance as a tool to interfere in Korea's domestic economic affairs, which is contrary to the Soviet proposal that the Economic and Social Council has already passed. Polish representative Bleting pointed out that the Economic and Social Council can only make decisions on the general principles of joint actions to assist Korea. The U.S. proposal involves Korea's own policies and is therefore not within the purview of the Economic and Social Council. However, under U.S. manipulation, the U.S.-British bloc voting machine brazenly passed the U.S. proposal in the end. Therefore, despite the passage of the Soviet proposal aimed at guaranteeing the rights of the Korean people, the representatives of the U.S.-British bloc are still trying to plan a form of organized assistance to Korea so that they can actually interfere in Korea's economic life.

　　经社理事会在美国操纵下
    竟通过干涉朝鲜内政议案
    与前所通过的苏联三建议完全抵触
    【新华社三十日讯】综合塔斯社纽约讯：联合国经社理事会已于二十六日结束对援助朝鲜的一般原则问题的讨论。
    二十五日会议通过了苏联提出的在组织援助朝鲜工作上应有朝鲜代表参加的建议。按苏联关于不得利用援助来干涉朝鲜内政以及分配援助品原则的二项建议，前已为经社理事会所通过。
    美英集团代表为了掩饰其阴谋，虽然不敢公开反对苏联维护朝鲜人民利益的建议，但其真实面目终由美国在二十五日会议上提出的提案而暴露出来。美国提案建议理事会通过朝鲜应在国内实行明确的经济与财政政策的决定。苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰代表反对美国提案。苏联代表亚鲁疆指出，美国提案将使外国有可能利用援助作为干涉朝鲜国内经济事务的工具，这是与经社理事会已经通过的苏联提案相抵触的。波兰代表白莱丁斯指出：经社理事会仅能在援助朝鲜的联合行动的一般原则方面采取决定，美国提案涉及朝鲜本身的政策，因而不在经社理事会职权以内。但是在美国操纵下，美英集团表决机器最后仍悍然通过了美国提案。因而尽管旨在保证朝鲜人民权利的苏联提案得以通过，美英集团代表仍力图计划一种有组织的援助朝鲜的形式，以便使他们实际上能够干涉朝鲜的经济生活。
