　　Soviet New Inventions and Production Construction
    Automatic Machinery Speeds Up Automobile Manufacturing
   Soviet engineers have designed a number of automatic machines and mechanical devices in automobile manufacturing, which have greatly reduced the labor of workers and accelerated the process of automobile manufacturing.
   The newly invented automatic welding method for automobile wheels this year is unparalleled in the world in terms of work efficiency and ingenious design. The automatic car body polishing machine replaces manual labor, speeding up this labor process by three to four times. Special powerful assembly machines accelerate the manufacture of truck chassis. These devices have replaced unskilled labor. Ordinary workers and loaders of yesterday have become machine technicians today. The manufacture of trucks and cars has also been greatly accelerated. For example, the manufacture and assembly of parts for the "ZIS-150" four-ton truck has been accelerated by 31.8 percent compared to 1949. The assembly of "Victory" and "Moskvich" cars has been accelerated by 50 percent compared to last year.
    Cultivating Colored Cotton Using the Michurin Method
   Soviet scientists have cultivated a variety of colored cotton and have opened up thousands of hectares of colored cotton fields. There are usually a few green cotton flowers in a thousand cotton flowers. Soviet scientists, using the Michurin method, carefully selected these cotton seeds and cultivated a batch of green cotton flowers with darker colors. Then, they crossbred green cotton flowers with different shades of color, cultivating a total of twenty kinds of cotton, ranging from gray to brownish-red. Colored cotton does not fade in strong sunlight, but becomes more intense. Recently, Soviet scientists are further experimenting with cultivating red and black cotton. The application of colored cotton can reduce the dyeing costs in industry, which account for 10 percent of the cost.
    Autumn Afforestation Begins in Southern Soviet Regions
   Large-scale autumn afforestation work has begun in the southern Soviet regions of Ukraine, Stalingrad, Rostov, Saratov, and the Krasnodar Territory. Since the implementation of Stalin's plan to transform nature two years ago, collective farms, state farms, and forest farms in the steppe and forest-steppe zones of the European part of the Soviet Union have planted more than one million hectares of forest on the prescribed 5.7 million hectares of land. Last year, collective farms and state farms exceeded the afforestation plan by about one time. Due to the seed cluster planting method invented by Lysenko, afforestation work has developed extremely rapidly. The Soviet government had originally decided to increase the afforestation area in 1950 to 700,000 hectares, replacing the original 425,300 hectares, but this expanded plan had already been overfulfilled this spring. The current autumn afforestation work is being carried out outside of this year's expanded plan. Grass planting and sand fixation work are also proceeding at the same speed. Now, new forest areas in Stalingrad, Saratov, Astrakhan, and other states have blocked the dry winds, the vast steppe landscape has changed, and tens of thousands of hectares of farmland are surrounded by young oak forests.
   In the past two years, the Soviet people have established approximately 400 afforestation stations, possessing more than 22,000 tractors, hundreds of tree planters, powerful plows, bulldozers, and excavators. Ninety percent of afforestation work in the arid areas of the Soviet Union has been mechanized. The mechanization of afforestation work this year has increased 22 times compared to 1948, and will increase 42 times next year.
    Farmers in Various Regions Begin Sowing Winter Crops
   Collective farmers in many regions of the Soviet Union are now carrying out the sowing of winter crops rapidly and in an organized manner. The area of land where sowing work has been completed has increased by approximately four million hectares (approximately 60.8 million mu) compared to the same period last year. The sown area of winter crops, especially winter wheat, has also increased compared to last year. Now, states in the non-black soil zone of the Soviet Union, such as Moscow, Gorky, Lipetsk, as well as the Urals and Siberia, have begun large-scale wheat sowing. Collective farmers in Ukraine and the North Caucasus are busily sowing high-quality wheat seeds in deeply ploughed fertile soil.

　　苏联的新发明和生产建设
    自动机械的装置使汽车制造加速
   苏联工程师在汽车制造方面设计了若干自动的机器和机械装置，已大大减轻了工人的劳动，并且加速了汽车制造的过程。
   今年新发明的汽车车轮自动熔接法，其工作的效率和设计的巧妙是举世无比的。汽车车身自动磨光机代替了手工劳动，使这一劳动程序加快了三至四倍。特种强大集合机加速了运货汽车的车台的制造。这些装置已代替了不熟练的劳动。昨天的普通工人和装载工人今天已变成机器技工了。货车和轿车的制造也已大大加速。例如“齐斯——一五○”式四吨货车零件的制造和装配，已比一九四九年加快了百分之三一点八。“胜利”牌和“莫斯克维奇”牌轿车的装配已比去年加快了百分之五十。
    用米邱林方法培育有色棉花
   苏联科学家已培育出多种的有色棉花，并已开辟了数千公顷的有色棉田。在一千朵棉花里通常有几朵绿棉花，苏联科学家用米邱林的方法，谨慎地选择了这种棉籽，培养出一批颜色较深的绿棉花来，然后用色度不同的绿棉花来串种，一共培育出二十种从灰色一直到褐红色的棉花。有色棉花在强烈的阳光下并不褪色，反而变得更浓。最近苏联科学家正在进一步实验培育红色的和黑色的棉花。有色棉花的应用，可以减少在工业上占成本百分之十的染色费用。
    苏联南部地区开始秋季造林
   苏联南部乌克兰、斯大林格勒、罗斯多夫、萨拉多夫等州及克拉斯诺达边疆区，已开始进行大规模的秋季造林工作。自斯大林改造自然的计划执行两年以来，苏联欧洲部分草原与森林草原地带的各集体农场、国家农场和林场，已经在规定的五百七十万公顷土地上种植了一百万公顷以上的森林。去年各集体农场和国家农场超过了造林计划约一倍之多。由于采用李森科所发明的种子簇种法，造林工作发展得极为迅速。苏联政府原已决定将一九五零年的造林面积增加到七十万公顷，以代替原定的四十二万五千三百公顷，但这个扩大的计划在今年春季已经超过完成了，现在的秋季造林工作是在今年的扩大计划之外进行的。种草与固定沙土的工作也以同样速度进行着。现在，斯大林格勒、萨拉多夫、阿斯特拉罕等州新的森林地带已阻住了干燥的风，广大的草原面貌已经改变，数万公顷的农田已环绕着嫩橡林了。
   苏联人民在最近两年内约建立了四百个造林站，拥有二万二千余具拖拉机、数百具树木播植机、效力强大的耕犁、开路机与挖掘机等。苏联干旱地带的造林工作，百分之九十都已机械化。今年造林工作机械化较一九四八年增加了二十二倍，明年将要增加四十二倍。
    各地农民开始冬季作物播种
   苏联许多地区的集体农民，现正迅速而有组织地进行冬季作物的播种工作。现已完成播种工作的土地面积约较去年同期增加了四百万公顷（约合六千零八十万市亩）。冬季作物特别是冬季小麦的播种面积也较去年增加。现在苏联非黑土地带的各州如莫斯科、高尔基、利森州及乌拉尔和西伯利亚等地，都已开始大规模播种小麦。乌克兰和北高加索的集体农民正紧张地把优良的小麦种籽播种在深耕的沃土上。
