　　Sister Delegates of All Nationalities Gather Together
    All-China Democratic Women's Federation Hosts Cordial Reception

    [Xinhua News Agency, 27th] The All-China Democratic Women's Federation held a tea party on the evening of the 26th to entertain female members of minority nationality delegations and cultural troupes who came to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations. A total of 90 people were invited to attend.

    The tea party was held in an atmosphere of close unity among all nationalities. Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the Federation. She said, "The victory of the Chinese people has made it possible for our sisters of all nationalities to gather here, which is unprecedented and impossible in history. This is a new page in the women's movement. We must continue to consolidate our unity to further develop and consolidate the victory of the Chinese people. Now, the flames of the US imperialist war of aggression against Korea have approached the borders of our motherland, threatening the survival of all nationalities in our country. We have a historical, fraternal relationship with the Korean people, and we must support the Korean people and oppose American aggression. Our sisters of all nationalities must join the Korean sisters in shouldering the responsibility of defending world peace and the safety of all mankind."

    Representatives and literary and art workers of various nationalities spoke enthusiastically one after another. They unanimously denounced the deep oppression suffered by the people and women of all nationalities under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and unanimously expressed their gratitude to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for leading the people's struggle, which liberated them. In their speeches, representatives and literary and art workers of all nationalities expressed their concern for the Korean people and the compatriots in Taiwan, and expressed their anger and protest against the shameless acts of US imperialism in invading Korea and Taiwan. Amina, a representative of the Kazakh nationality from Xinjiang, said: When sisters of all nationalities gather closely together, we cannot forget the Korean sisters who are fighting for the independence and democracy of their motherland, and our Taiwan sisters who are suffering under the clutches of the Kuomintang reactionaries. We must use all our strength to support the Korean sisters, liberate our Taiwan, crush the aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism, and defend world peace.

    The tea party ended with the singing of "Unity is Strength" by all.
