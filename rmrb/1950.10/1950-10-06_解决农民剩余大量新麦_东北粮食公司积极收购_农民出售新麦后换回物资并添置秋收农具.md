Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 4th: The Northeast Grain Company is currently actively purchasing the surplus new wheat from farmers. As of September 21st, over 47,000 tons of new wheat have been purchased. Consequently, the cash flowing into rural areas, in August alone, amounted to over 110 billion Northeast currency units, resolving the farmers' necessary cash expenditures before the autumn harvest.

This year, the wheat planting area in various regions has expanded compared to previous years. Furthermore, due to farmers' meticulous cultivation, the total output has reached over 480,000 tons, exceeding the peak level of the puppet Manchukuo in 1943 by 40 percent. This year, after deducting what is needed for their own consumption, seed, and public grain contributions, Northeast farmers have at least 240,000 tons of new wheat to sell. In August, after the new wheat entered the market, the Northeast People's Government Trade Department convened a representative meeting of Northeast public and private flour mills and vendors to coordinate the wheat purchase work, stipulating a purchase price of one jin of wheat equivalent to 1.8 jin of sorghum. To take care of the disaster-stricken areas in parts of the provinces of Rehe, Liaoxi, and Liaodong, the Northeast Grain Company purchased wheat in the above-mentioned areas at a rate of one jin of wheat equivalent to two jin of sorghum, solving the food shortage problem for the disaster victims. Northeast farmers are generally satisfied with this year's wheat price, and are extremely enthusiastic about selling their new wheat. In August, the Northeast Grain Company purchased a total of 19,000 tons of new wheat, exceeding the original plan by 90 percent. The Songjiang Provincial Grain Company completed the purchasing tasks for both August and September within August, and plans to continue purchasing 5,000 tons starting in September. In addition to the Grain Company, public enterprises and private merchants in various provinces and cities are also carrying out purchases according to the already decided purchase plan.

After selling their new wheat, farmers in the wheat-producing areas, in addition to directly exchanging it for some materials, have also purchased urgently needed livestock, carts, sickles, brooms, and other autumn harvest agricultural tools.

　　解决农民剩余大量新麦
    东北粮食公司积极收购
    农民出售新麦后换回物资并添置秋收农具
    【新华社沈阳四日电】东北区粮食公司现正积极收购农民剩余的新麦。截至九月二十一日止，已收进新麦四万七千余吨；从而流入农村的现金，仅八月份即有东北币一千一百余亿元，解决了农民在秋收前必要的现金开支。
    今年各地小麦种植面积比往年扩大，加之农民精心耕作，因而使总产量达到四十八万吨以上，超过一九四三年伪满最高水平的百分之四十。今年东北农民所收新麦，除自己食用、留作种子和缴纳公粮外，至少有二十四万吨需要出售。八月间，新麦上市后，东北人民政府贸易部即召开东北公私营面粉制造与贩卖业者的代表会议，统筹兼顾地布置收麦工作，并规定按一斤小麦合一斤八两高粱的比价收购。东北粮食公司为照顾热河、辽西、辽东三省部分遭灾地区，则在上述地区按一斤小麦折二斤高粱比率收购，解决灾民吃粮困难。东北农民对今年的麦价普遍表示满意，出卖新麦极为踊跃。八月份东北区粮食公司共收进新麦一万九千吨，超过原定计划百分之九十。松江省粮食公司则在八月份内，完成了八、九两月的收购任务，九月份起准备继续收购五千吨。目前除粮食公司外，各省、市公营企业和私商也正在按照业已决定的收购计划进行收购。
    各产麦区的农民出卖新麦后，除直接换回一部分物资外，并添置了迫切需要的牲口、大车、镰刀、扫帚等秋收农具。
