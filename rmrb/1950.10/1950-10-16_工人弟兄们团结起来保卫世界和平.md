　　Workers, Unite to Defend World Peace
    Liu Changsheng
    As long as imperialism exists, the possibility of war exists. When imperialism becomes more desperate, it may become more rampant. Like the recent two intrusions of American invading aircraft into our country's airspace in Korea, strafing our people in Andong, and at the same time provoking the Soviet Union by attacking Soviet aircraft. They want to use these brutal acts of aggression to create tension in the world situation. Therefore, at this time, every kind person who opposes wars of aggression should unite more closely, respond to the peace signature movement, express their attitude and be determined. Only by strengthening the power of the peace camp can we effectively stop the Third World War. We must realize that signing the peace declaration means expanding the united front of the people to defend peace. The peace camp has one more point of strength, and the war camp will suffer one point of blow. The more people who sign the peace declaration, the more powerful the peace camp will be, the greater the guarantee of peace will be, the more isolated the warmongers will be, and the smaller the danger of war will be. Therefore, vigorously promoting the peace signature movement is the most powerful counterattack against the American imperialist aggressors, and it is the greater the power to defend world peace.
    Worker brothers: Peace is the most precious thing for us. Our century-long anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle was aimed at obtaining a peaceful and stable environment, using our own labor to build our own world, to build our own prosperous and happy country, and to improve our lives. Now our own country, the People's Republic of China, has been established for nearly a year. Our working class has turned over and become the master of the country. Under the leadership of our own party and the People's Government, we have displayed a high degree of enthusiasm in overcoming difficulties and striving for the improvement of the country's financial and economic situation, and we have achieved brilliant results, consolidating the people's power. Now American imperialism is invading Korea and Taiwan again. Recently, American aircraft intruded into our country's airspace and strafed our compatriots. Our East China region is also burdened with the glorious task of liberating Taiwan. For the sake of lasting peace, for the sake of defending our people's country, protecting the fruits of the revolutionary struggle, and responding to the provocations of the aggressors. Our worker brothers in East China should more actively do a good job in production, and at the same time unite all the people and take the lead in launching the peace signature movement, and implement the signature movement into practical action.

　　工人弟兄们团结起来保卫世界和平
    刘长胜
    帝国主义存在一天，战争的可能性也存在一天。当帝国主义愈走头无路的时候，他也可能愈猖狂。像美国侵略朝鲜的军用飞机最近两次的侵入我国领空，在安东扫射我国人民，同时又向苏联挑衅，攻击苏联飞机。他们想利用这些残暴的侵略行为，造成世界局势的紧张。因此在这个时候，每一个反对侵略战争的善良人民，更应该加紧的团结起来，响应和平签名运动，表明态度下定决心。只有加强和平阵营的力量，才能有效的制止第三次世界大战。我们要认识到，在和平宣言上签了名，就是扩大了人民保卫和平的统一战线。和平阵营多一分力量，战争阵营就受到一分打击。有更多的人在和平宣言上签名，和平阵营就更有力量，和平的保障就更大，战争贩子就更孤立，战争的危险就更小。因此大力推动和平签名运动，就是给美帝侵略者以最有力的还击，就是保卫世界和平的力量愈强大。
    工人弟兄们：和平对于我们是最宝贵的。我们百年来的反帝反封建斗争就为了要得到和平安定的环境，来用自己的劳动建设自己的世界，建设我们自己富强康乐的国家，改善我们的生活。现在我们自己的国家中华人民共和国已成立将近一年，我们工人阶级翻了身，变成国家主人，在自己的党与人民政府领导下，在克服困难争取国家财政经济好转上发挥了高度积极性，有了辉煌的成绩，巩固了人民的政权。现在美国帝国主义又正在侵略朝鲜、台湾。最近美国飞机又侵入我国领空，扫射我同胞。我们华东地区又负担着解放台湾的光荣任务。为了持久和平，为了捍卫我们人民国家，保护革命斗争的成果，回答侵略者的挑衅行为。我们华东的工人弟兄们，应该更积极搞好生产，同时团结全体人民，带头把和平签名运动开展起来，把签名运动贯彻到实际行动里去。
