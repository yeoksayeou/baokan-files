Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 9th: Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and the areas along the Yangtze River in northern Anhui have concluded their early autumn harvests and are now comprehensively intensifying their autumn ploughing. Some areas of Shandong and northern Jiangsu have already begun sowing wheat.

The aforementioned regions have generally reported bumper harvests of early autumn crops this year, with average yields increasing by 10 to 20 percent compared to previous years. In order to strive for even greater increases in production next year, local people's governments are paying great attention to leading this year's autumn ploughing and sowing work, calling on the broad masses of farmers to purchase more draught animals, sow in a timely manner, and pay attention to improving agricultural techniques. Farmers in the areas of Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and southern Anhui that have had bumper harvests this year have increased their purchases of draught animals, but still feel that they are insufficient. Therefore, in addition to mutual adjustment of draught animals among farmers, some areas of Shandong and northern Jiangsu have organized manpower to pull plows or use iron harrows to solve the difficulties of lacking cattle, ensuring timely sowing.

In terms of improving techniques, most of the areas in Shandong and northern Jiangsu that have undergone land reform are universally promoting deep ploughing, seed selection, seed soaking, and increased fertilization. Most of the farmland in these areas is required to be ploughed twice this year, to a depth of four to five inches; some areas of northern Jiangsu are also planning to plough three times. In addition, many areas have prepared a large amount of fertilizer. Laiyang Prefecture in Shandong has accumulated green manure that can fill over 1.3 million small carts; after the autumn harvest, many farmers in Yancheng Prefecture in northern Jiangsu went to the river to collect aquatic plants to make fertilizer or bought piglets to make manure. The Shandong Provincial Cooperative General Agency borrowed 50 million jin of soybeans from the Provincial People's Government to organize rural oil mills to make soybean cakes; and purchased 10.15 million jin of soybean cakes from other places to lend or sell to cooperative members, solving the fertilizer difficulties of farmers.

Local people's governments are paying more attention to improving varieties and preventing diseases during autumn sowing. In order to prevent the harm of wheat bunt and black ear disease, the Shandong Provincial People's Government has made many important measures, calling on farmers to carefully select and soak seeds, and arranging for the people's governments at all levels under its jurisdiction to carry out technical guidance in a focused manner and promote improved varieties. At the same time, the province plans to lend the 5 million jin of high-quality wheat seeds identified and purchased in various places this year to farmers for sowing. Jiaozhou People's Special Office has also promoted 200,000 jin of flat wheat ear varieties. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have purchased a large number of medicines to kill crop diseases and insects and sold them to farmers to prevent black ear disease and wheat nematode disease, so as to strengthen the reproductive capacity of wheat next year.

### 山东、苏北、皖北加紧进行秋耕秋种

　　山东、苏北、皖北加紧进行秋耕秋种
    【新华社上海九日电】山东、苏北及皖北沿长江地区早秋收获已经结束，现正全面加紧秋耕。山东、苏北部分地区已开始种麦。
    上述地区今年早秋作物一般均告丰收，平均比往年增产一成到二成。为了争取明年更大的增产，各地人民政府都很重视领导今年的秋耕秋种工作，号召广大农民添购耕畜，及时耕种，注意改进农作技术。山东、苏北、皖南今年丰收地区的农民虽曾增购大批耕畜，但仍感耕畜不够。因此，各地农民除互相调剂耕畜外，山东、苏北有的地区即组织人力拉犁，或用铁钯刨地等办法解决了缺乏耕牛的困难，保证了及时耕种。
    在改进技术方面，山东、苏北大部分经过土地改革的地区，普遍提倡深耕、选种、浸种和增施肥料。这些地区今年的大部分农田均要求耕二遍，深达四、五寸；苏北有的地区还拟耕三遍。另外，许多地区还准备了大批肥料。山东莱阳专区已积好绿肥，约可装一百三十多万小车；苏北盐城专区在秋收后，很多农民下河绞水草制肥或买小猪回来造粪。山东省合作总社向省人民政府借出大豆五千万斤，组织乡村油坊打豆饼；并从外地购回豆饼一千零十五万斤，贷放或售给社员，解决农民肥料困难。
    各地人民政府在秋种中更注意改良品种和预防病害工作。山东省人民政府为防除小麦腥黑穗病的危害，作出很多重要措施，召号农民认真选种、浸种，布置所属各级人民政府有重点地进行技术指导，推广良种。同时，该省拟将今年在各地鉴定收购的五百万斤优良麦种，贷给各地农民播种。胶州人民专署并推广扁麦穗麦种二十万斤。各地供销合作社买回大量杀害农作物病虫的药品，售给农民防治黑穗病、麦线病等，以加强明年麦子的生殖能力。
