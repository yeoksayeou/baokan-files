[Reported by] Worker Correspondents Liu Shijie and Tang Zhixue: The administrative leaders of the Beijing 70th Ordnance Factory have caused significant production losses by treating workers' rationalization proposals with a bureaucratic attitude. The 70th Ordnance Factory transitioned to peaceful industrial production in July of last year, and it has been over a year since. The factory should have been operating as an enterprise, but the administrative leaders have always relied on tasks given by higher authorities and haven't actively sought solutions themselves. They've missed several opportunities to secure orders and never actively pursued them. In June, the Electric Power Bureau wanted to order hundreds of thousands of screws. The factory's engineering department did not correctly assess the factory's manpower, machinery, equipment, and workers' new attitudes towards labor. Without consulting the workers, they subjectively assumed that they couldn't complete the task and didn't dare to accept the order. In reality, the factory had no work to do, wasting labor.

With few production tasks, the administrative planning was also insufficient (for example, the head of the engineering department was still unaware of the September production plan on August 23rd). The monthly production plans were only distributed to the various factories around the 4th or 5th of the month (the 9th of May in May). After the departments and workshops planned and assigned tasks to the workers, it was already around the 10th, and a third of the month had passed. Many workers often had no work to do at the beginning of the month, and at the end of the month, they were afraid of not completing the tasks, so they worked overtime in a rush. Some workers in the quenching group of the 4th workshop worked overtime for 60 to 80 hours in May. The organization between various processes in the factory was not thorough enough, and the supply of tools and materials was not timely, constantly causing work stoppages and delays. Even though the workers worked hard and exceeded the administrative estimations, they still couldn't complete the tasks. The milling group of the 4th workshop spent 293 hours waiting for work and materials in August and 388 hours doing odd jobs, accounting for 24% of the group's total working hours of 2816 hours. The workers' actual working hours were 1806.5 hours. Although they exceeded the workload by 185 hours (an overtime rate of 29%), they still failed to complete 12 out of 15 tasks.

The factory and engineering department did not delve into the situation and were unaware of problems in production links between the workshops. They also delayed in processing many rationalization proposals made by workers. For example, in August, the 2nd workshop lent file blanks to the 4th workshop, but production was affected because they were not supplied in a timely manner. The factory only found out about this situation after the 4th workshop submitted a report. The rear cover of a cartridge weighed 1.07 kg, but the blank made by the factory weighed 2.18 kg. In early May, workers suggested that the head was too large and that only half a kilogram needed to be left, which would save 50 kg of iron and 50% of turning time for every 100 blanks. The engineering department said, "It's too small, and we're afraid of pinholes." In fact, the size of the blank had little to do with the number of pinholes. Recently, the finished files made had an outer diameter of 12 mm, which could be made with 14 mm steel. However, because the administration didn't investigate, research, or consult with the workers, they subjectively designed it with 16 mm material, wasting a lot of material and man-hours. The detonators made by the 5th workshop were not effective. The workers had suggested early on, "I'm afraid there's something wrong with the fulminate of mercury." The administration didn't listen, and tens of thousands of detonators were made and couldn't be sold. Recently, the Ordnance Bureau sent people to the factory to inspect and proved that there was indeed something wrong with the fulminate of mercury (the director of the 5th workshop has already made a self-criticism on this matter). The detonating fuses made by the 5th workshop were also of poor quality (someone was injured when a certain mine used them), and hundreds of thousands of meters were stockpiled and couldn't be sold. The factory and engineering department didn't pay attention to these major problems in a timely manner and study solutions.

In May of this year, the factory established a management committee, but it hasn't played its due role. Some important issues related to production, such as organizing production competitions and reward systems, have never been discussed at the meetings. The committee also doesn't attach importance to the suggestions made by workers. There are several large holes in the roof of a warehouse in the first branch, and over 20,000 board feet of lumber are stored in the open air. Workers have raised objections to these wasteful situations, but the management committee hasn't taken appropriate action. When the management committee was established, a meeting of worker representatives was held, and workers made over 500 proposals related to production. The meeting decided to hand them over to the relevant departments for research and handling. Many proposals have yet to be addressed. At the second meeting of worker representatives, there was no report on the progress of implementation. From the above facts, it can be seen that the administrative leaders of the 70th Ordnance Factory have a serious bureaucratic work style. If this work style is not changed, there will be more significant losses to the people's factory and the people's property. During this rectification campaign, the leading comrades of the 70th Ordnance Factory should conduct a profound self-examination and formulate a plan for future improvement.

### 北京七十兵工厂  忽视工人合理化建议  使生产遭受很大损失

　　北京七十兵工厂
    忽视工人合理化建议
    使生产遭受很大损失
    【本报讯】工人通讯员刘式杰、唐志学报道：北京七十兵工厂行政负责人以官僚主义的态度对待工人的合理化建议，使生产遭受很大的损失。七十兵工厂从去年七月转为和平工业生产，到现在已有一年多了，工厂原应实行企业化经营，但该厂行政领导人总是依赖上级给任务，自己不主动想办法。遇到几次订货机会，从未主动争取。六月份电业总局要订制数十万个螺丝，厂部工程科对厂内人力、机器设备和工人新的劳动态度没有正确的估计，又不和工人商量，只是坐在办公室里，主观上以为完不成任务，结果就不敢承制。实际上该厂是没活可做，浪费了劳动力。
    生产任务不多，行政上的计划性又不够（如工程科长在八月二十三日还不知道九月份的生产计划），每月的生产计划到当月四、五号（五月份到五月九日）才布置到各厂。所部、工部再计划一下，布置给工人，已经是十号左右，一个月过去了三分之一。月初很多工人常常没活干，月底怕完不成任务，就加班突击。四所淬火组五月份有些工人加班六十到八十多小时。该厂各工序之间组织不够周密，工具材料供应不及时，不断造成停工待料现象，工人虽然紧着干，超过行政上的估工，也完不成任务。四所铣工组八月份等工待料二九三小时，做零活三八八小时，共占全组总工时二八一六小时的百分之二十四。工人实做工时一八○六小时半，虽然超工一八五小时（超工率百分之二十九），但是十五种任务中仍有十二种未能完成。
    厂部和工程科不深入了解情况，各所生产联系出了毛病也不知道，对工人提出的很多合理化建议迟迟不处理。如八月份二所借给四所锉刀坯子，因为没有及时供应，影响了生产。对于这一情况，直到四所上了签呈，厂部才知道。卡盆后盖重一·○七公斤，该厂所作毛坯却重二·一八公斤。五月初工人提出作头太大，只要留半公斤作头就可以了，这样每一百个毛坯能省五十公斤铁和百分之五十的车工工时。工程科说：“太小了，怕出砂眼。”事实上，毛坯大小跟砂眼多少没有什么大关系。最近做的锉成品外径十二粍，用十四粍的钢料就行了。但因行政上不调查、不研究、不跟工人商量，凭主观设计了十六粍材料，浪费了不少材料和工时。五所作的雷管效率不佳，工人早建议说：“怕是黄药有毛病。”行政上不听，做出几万个雷管，都卖不出去。最近兵工局派人来厂检查，证明还是黄药有毛病（五所所主任对此事已作检讨）。五所做的导火索也因质量不佳（某矿使用时曾伤过人），存了数十万公尺卖不出去。对这些重大问题，厂部和工程科都没有及时注意，研究解决。
    今年五月，该厂成立了管委会，但没有发挥应有的作用。一些有关生产的重要问题，如组织生产竞赛、奖励制度等，从未在会上讨论。对工人提的建议也不予重视。一分库库房顶有几个大窟窿，另有两万多板尺木料放在露天地里。对这些浪费情形，工人都提过意见，管委会一直没作适当处理。成立管委会时，开过一次职工代表会议，工人提了五百多条有关生产的提案，会上决定交给有关各部研究办理，很多提案直到现在还没下文。开第二次职工代表会时，也没有报告执行情况。从以上种种事实看来，七十兵工厂行政领导人存在严重的官僚主义作风，这种作风如不转变，对人民工厂、人民财产会有更重大损失。在这次整风中七十兵工厂领导同志应深刻检查，作出今后改进计划。
