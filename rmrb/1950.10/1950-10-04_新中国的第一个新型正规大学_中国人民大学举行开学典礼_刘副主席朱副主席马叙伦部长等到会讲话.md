Renmin University of China was decided to be established at the 11th Government Administration Council meeting of the Central People's Government on December 16, 1949. Its task is to accept the advanced construction experience of the Soviet Union, and hire Soviet professors to train various construction cadres for New China in a planned and step-by-step manner. Under the direct care and guidance of the Central People's Government and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and with the assistance of Soviet professors, the school has carried out nearly a year of preparation and enrollment work. Renmin University of China has now established eight undergraduate departments: Economic Planning, Finance, Trade, Factory Management, Cooperation, Law, Diplomacy, and Russian. There are eleven special courses: Economic Planning, Finance, Foreign Trade, Domestic Trade, Cooperation, Factory Management, Statistics, Law, Diplomacy, Education, and History and Geography. In addition, there is also a cultural remedial class. There are currently more than 3,000 students in the school, and workers and peasants cadres and advanced workers who have participated in the revolution for many years account for more than two-thirds of the total number of students.

The educational policy of Renmin University of China is to combine teaching with practice, and to combine Soviet experience with China's situation; it particularly emphasizes the quality and effectiveness of teaching in its work, and requires teachers' scientific level to continuously improve. Therefore, in addition to obtaining direct contact and assistance from relevant departments of the Central People's Government in terms of business guidance, the school also specifically established a research department in its organization to lead scientific research work, and also established teaching and research sections under the Academic Affairs Department and various departments to directly engage in teaching and research work. The school has now established 36 teaching and research offices, organizing 250 graduate students and more than 200 teachers to participate in the work, and 35 Soviet professors are separately responsible for scientific guidance. In terms of teaching methods, every course has classroom practice and production practice. The school pays great attention to planning and organization in the entire school work, and every course is implemented according to a very strict plan and implements a personal responsibility system.

    中国人民大学举行开学典礼
    刘副主席朱副主席马叙伦部长等到会讲话
    【新华社三日讯】新中国的第一个新型正规大学中国人民大学的开学典礼于三日在京隆重举行。
    在开学典礼上，吴玉章校长报告了中国人民大学的工作概况，指出中国人民大学所培养的学生都要用马列主义毛泽东思想武装起来，并准备培养成为掌握最新科学成就的专家。
    刘少奇副主席、朱德副主席都在会上讲话，一致指出中国人民大学创立的重大意义。在会上讲话的还有中央人民政府教育部马叙伦部长及该校苏联顾问安德里扬诺夫等和教员学生代表多人。
    参加典礼的尚有中央人民政府张澜副主席、林伯渠秘书长，委员何香凝、司徒美堂、彭泽民、章伯钧、徐特立、谢觉哉，政务院副总理董必武，教育部副部长韦悫与各部、院、署首长，北京各大学校长，来京参加国庆典礼的各地少数民族代表和其他来宾，苏联教授及全体教职员学生共四千余人。
    中国人民大学是中央人民政府政务院于一九四九年十二月十六日第十一次政务会议上决定设立的。它的任务是接受苏联先进的建设经验，并聘请苏联教授，有计划有步骤地培养新中国的各种建设干部。在中央人民政府与中共中央的直接关怀、指导，和苏联教授的协助之下，该校进行了将近一年的筹备和招生工作，中国人民大学现在已设立了本科的经济计划、财政、贸易、工厂管理、合作、法律、外交、俄文等八个系，专修科的经济计划、财政、对外贸易、国内贸易、合作、工厂管理、统计、法律、外交、教育、史地等十一个班，另外还设有一个文化补习班。全校现有学生三千余人，学生中参加革命多年的工农干部和先进工人占总人数三分之二以上。
    中国人民大学的教育方针是教学与实际联系，苏联经验与中国情况相结合；在工作中特别强调教学的质量和效果，并要求教员的科学水平不断提高。因此该校除在业务指导上取得中央人民政府各有关部门的直接联系与协助外，并在组织上特别设立了研究部，领导科学研究工作，又分别在教务部及各系下设立了教研室，以直接从事教学和研究工作。该校现在已经成立了三十六个教学研究室，组织二百五十名研究生二百多名教员参加工作，并有苏联教授三十五人分头担任科学指导。在教学方法上每门功课都有课堂实习和生产实习。该校在整个学校工作中十分注意计划性与组织性，每门功课都按非常严密的计划执行并实行专人负责制。
