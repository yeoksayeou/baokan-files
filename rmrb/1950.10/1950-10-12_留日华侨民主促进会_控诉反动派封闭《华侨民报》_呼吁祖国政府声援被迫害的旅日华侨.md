Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: This office recently received a fast-mail telegram dated September 28th from the League for the Democratic Promotion of Overseas Chinese in Japan to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and various news agencies and newspapers, accusing the Kuomintang remnant bandits' pseudo "Resident Mission in Japan" of colluding with American and Japanese reactionaries to illegally close the League's organ, "Overseas Chinese People's Daily," and appealing to the Motherland for support for the persecuted overseas Chinese in Japan. The telegram stated:

    Under the instigation of international imperialism's policy of supporting Japan, the Japanese reactionary government has recently become increasingly rampant, persecuting progressive elements and depriving them of freedom of speech. In less than half a year, almost all democratic newspapers published in Japan have been banned. Finally, they extended their evil claws to the "Overseas Chinese People's Daily" published by overseas Chinese. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang's pseudo "Resident Mission in Japan" regarded "Overseas Chinese People's Daily" as a thorn in their side. From the beginning of the tenure of the pseudo-mission head, He Shili, he paid special attention to "Overseas Chinese People's Daily" and made various threats. Because the threats were ineffective, they colluded with international imperialism and the Japanese government, using the signboard of "Allied Headquarters" to implement high-pressure tactics against overseas Chinese.

    At 6:30 a.m. on September 28th, the Special Investigation Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Justice and the Metropolitan Police Department mobilized about 300 police officers and suddenly surrounded the Overseas Chinese People's Daily office in the Zhonghua Xueyou Association Hall in Koishikawa-cho, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo. Because the door was locked and they could not enter, they broke through the window without waiting for the person in charge to arrive, and searched extensively for three hours, confiscating newspapers, account books, documents, and books, which were carried away in large trucks, and the office, printing press, safe, and telephone were sealed. In the name of the Japanese Minister of Justice, Takeo Ohashi, a written notice was given to Zeng Senmao, editor and publisher of the Overseas Chinese People's Daily, stating: According to MacArthur's instructions, the publication of the "Overseas Chinese People's Daily" was ordered to be suspended indefinitely. Just as overseas Chinese from all walks of life were enthusiastically preparing to celebrate the anniversary of the founding of the People's Government of the Motherland, and the "Overseas Chinese People's Daily" was expanding and printing a special celebratory issue, the "Overseas Chinese People's Daily" was suddenly subjected to such illegal suppression by international imperialism and the Japanese government. Every overseas Chinese person was filled with indignation. International imperialism and the Japanese government, by so depriving overseas Chinese in Japan of their freedom of speech, are clearly violating the Potsdam Declaration and increasingly moving towards the path of fascism. The unauthorized intrusion into the newspaper office without the person in charge being present, and the arbitrary sealing and confiscation of items, further proves the rampant lawlessness of the Japanese police.

    On the same day, upon hearing the news, the League for the Democratic Promotion of Overseas Chinese in Japan immediately convened an emergency Central Committee meeting and resolved to lodge a strong protest with the Japanese government. The meeting immediately elected Gan Wenfang, chairman of the League, and Zeng Senmao, director of the Secretariat and editor and publisher of the "Overseas Chinese People's Daily," to jointly meet with the Japanese Minister of Justice, Takeo Ohashi, along with representatives from the Overseas Chinese General Association in Japan, the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Federation, and the Overseas Chinese Students General Association. They raised questions and demanded the cancellation of all illegal measures and an apology. Takeo Ohashi responded with sophistry, shirking responsibility and claiming that everything was ordered by "Allied Headquarters." However, he refused to produce the "Allied Headquarters" instructions, only saying that one could inquire with the "Resident Mission in Japan" to find out. This further confirmed the common conspiracy between the pseudo "Resident Mission in Japan" and international imperialism and the Japanese government, further increasing the resentment of the overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese were gnashing their teeth at the pseudo "Mission's" act of selling out their compatriots and the fascist means of international imperialism and the Japanese government, and were firmly vowing to fight to the end. In addition to doing its best to carry out the struggle, the League for the Democratic Promotion of Overseas Chinese in Japan will report the situation of persecution to the Motherland's government and compatriots across the country, calling on everyone to support the oppressed compatriots in Japan.

　　留日华侨民主促进会
    控诉反动派封闭《华侨民报》
    呼吁祖国政府声援被迫害的旅日华侨
    【新华社十一日讯】此间顷接到留日华侨民主促进会于九月二十八日致中华人民共和国中央人民政府及各通讯社、报社的快邮代电，控诉国民党残匪伪“驻日代表团”与美、日反动派狼狈为奸，非法封闭该会机关报《华侨民报》，并向祖国呼吁声援被迫害的旅日侨胞。电文称：
    在国际帝国主义扶日政策的鼓动下，日本反动政府最近日益猖獗。迫害进步分子，剥夺言论自由。不到半年，所有日本出版的民主报刊，被禁殆尽。最后又对华侨所出版的《华侨民报》伸出魔手。蒋介石匪帮的伪“驻日代表团”更视《华侨民报》为眼中钉，在伪代表团长何世礼就任之初，就对《华侨民报》特别注意，并作出种种恐吓。因为恐吓无效，竟与国际帝国主义及日本政府狼狈为奸，假借“盟军总部”的招牌，对侨胞施行高压手段。
    九月二十八日清晨六时半，日本法务府特别审查局及警视厅，动员了警察约三百余人，突将东京都文京区小石川町中华学友会馆内华侨民报社包围。因为门已上锁，不得入内，他们竟不等负责人到来，便破窗而入，大肆搜查达三小时之久，将报纸、帐簿、文件及书籍等没收，用大汽车载去，并将办公室、印刷机、金库及电话等封闭。并以日本法务总裁大桥武夫名义，书面通知华侨民报编辑兼发行人曾森茂称：根据麦克阿瑟的指令，命令《华侨民报》无限期停止发行。就在各界华侨正在热烈筹备庆祝祖国人民政府成立周年纪念，和《华侨民报》正在扩大编印庆祝特刊的时节，《华侨民报》突然遭受国际帝国主义及日本政府这样非法镇压。每个华侨莫不愤慨填胸。国际帝国主义及日本政府，如此剥夺在日华侨的言论自由，显然是违背波茨坦公告，日益走上法西斯的道路。至于未经负责人在场，擅自侵入报社，任意查封、没收物件，更足以证明日本警察的横行无法。
    当日，留日华侨民主促进会闻讯后，立即召集了紧急中央委员会，决议向日本政府提出强硬抗议。当即推选本会主席甘文芳、事务局长兼《华侨民报》编辑兼发行人曾森茂，联合了留日华侨总会、东京华侨联合会及留日同学总会等代表，往见日本法务总裁大桥武夫。提出质问，并要求取消一切非法措置并道歉。大桥武夫诡辞答辩，推诿责任称：一切均受命于“盟军总部”。但又拒绝出示“盟军总部”指令，仅谓可往询“驻日代表团”便知。由此更证实了伪“驻日代表团”与国际帝国主义及日本政府的共同阴谋，愈益增加华侨的愤恨。华侨对伪“代表团”这种出卖同胞的行为，与国际帝国主义及日本政府的法西斯手段，莫不切齿，坚决发誓，一定要斗争到底。留日华侨民主促进会除了尽力进行斗争外，并将迫害情形报告给祖国政府和全国同胞，呼吁大家声援在日被压迫的同胞。
