　　Yesterday's Free and Happy Seoul Has Now Become a Living Hell
    Korean Central News Agency
    After the American invading army and its running dog Syngman Rhee gang occupied Seoul at a great cost, they immediately and frantically carried out all kinds of barbaric atrocities, such as large-scale massacres of the people, plunder of property, and rape of women. Every corner of Seoul is stained with the blood of the people and filled with the bloody atmosphere of massacre and plunder. Seoul, which had just gained freedom and happiness, has been turned into a dark and terrifying living hell by the American beasts.
    On October 6, Baek Yeon-ju, a resident of Wonnam-dong (transliteration) in Seoul, who escaped from the living hell after nine deaths and one life, tearfully accused the mortal enemies of the heinous crimes they committed in Seoul.
    After the American army and the Syngman Rhee puppet army invaded Seoul, they led the special agent bandits and started running wild like mad dogs.
    In every alley the devils entered, one could hear the cries of women, the miserable wails of children, and the gunshots of innocent people being massacred.
    On the evening of October 2, two American soldiers and three Syngman Rhee "National Defense Forces" entered Ikseon-dong (transliteration), dragged Li Mingfu's family of four, who ran a grocery store, onto the street, and forced the citizens who had not had time to escape to witness their bloody massacre. They hanged Li Mingfu on a 10-meter-high electric pole, and used the remaining rope to hang his ten-year-old son and six-year-old daughter. Li Mingfu's wife, who fainted after seeing her husband and children brutally murdered by the devils, was dragged into an alley and gang-raped by two American soldiers. After that, they threw this woman, who was already half-dead, into a fire and burned her to death. Guo, the wife of Yoon Deok-jeong, who lived behind Dongdaemun, was eight months pregnant. Because her husband had gone into hiding, she was also brutally murdered by the devils. The bloodsucking beasts collectively shot and killed more than 300 residents in the Donam-dong area, and plundered more than 20 women from Cheongnyangri, who were all brutally murdered after being raped. Thousands of residents were massacred in the Seodaemun district. In some areas where there were no people to massacre, they deceived the fleeing people by saying that they would distribute goods, and when they returned, they would shoot them with machine guns. They once collectively massacred more than 200 citizens in this way.
    The miserable sounds coming from the collapsed and burning houses, the howls of the executioners, the corpses hanging on the utility poles in the streets, the corpses of women and children scattered on the streets... All of this completely turned Seoul into a living hell.
    Baek Yeon-ju finally said with gritted teeth: Although the atrocities of the American robbers are becoming more and more ferocious, the citizens of Seoul, eager for revenge, are continuing to fight the enemy to the death with fiery anger.

　　昨天自由幸福的汉城今天已经变成活地狱
    朝鲜中央通讯社
    美国侵略军及其走狗李承晚匪帮在以极大代价侵占汉城后，立即疯狂地进行大规模屠杀人民、掠夺财产、强奸妇女等种种野蛮暴行。汉城的每个角落都染遍了人民的鲜血，充满着屠杀和掠夺的血腥气息。刚刚获得自由幸福的汉城，竟又被美国野兽们变为黑暗恐怖的活地狱。
    十月六日九死一生逃出活地狱的汉城市元南洞（译音）居民白延柱，一字一泪地控诉了不共戴天的仇敌们在汉城所犯下的滔天罪行。
    美军和李承晚伪军侵入汉城市后，就带领着特务匪徒，疯狗般地开始为所欲为了。
    鬼子们走进的每个胡同，都听到妇女们的悲鸣和孩子们凄惨的哭叫声，和屠杀无辜人民的枪声。
    十月二日晚间走进亦善洞（译音）的两个美军和三个李承晚“国防军”，将开杂货铺的李明福一家四口人拉到街上，并强迫集合来不及逃走的市民，来亲眼看他们的血腥屠杀。他们把李明福吊死在高有十公尺的电杆上，并用剩下的绳子把他的十岁男孩和六岁女孩也吊死了。亲眼看到丈夫和孩子们被鬼子残酷屠杀而失去知觉昏倒的李明福的妻子，被两个美国兵拉进胡同，加以轮奸。之后，他们竟又把这个已陷于半死状态的妇女投到火堆里烧死了。住在东大门后面的尹德正的妻子郭氏，妊娠八个月，因为她的丈夫出去避难，也被鬼子们残酷的屠杀了。吸血的野兽们在都南洞地区集体枪杀了居民三百余名，掠去清凉里的妇女二十余名，都在强奸后残酷地屠杀了。西大门区内有成千的居民被屠杀。甚至在某些地区找不到可屠杀的人，便欺骗逃难的人民，说配给东西，当他们回来以后，就用机枪扫射。他们用这种方法曾一次集体屠杀了二百余名市民。
    从塌倒燃烧的房屋里传出的凄惨声音、刽子手们的嚎叫声、吊在街道电线杆上的尸体、散乱在街旁的妇女和儿童的尸体……这一切把汉城市完全变成了活地狱。
    白延柱最后切齿地说：虽然美国强盗的暴行越来越凶，但是，报仇心切的汉城市民正怀着火焰般的愤怒，继续对敌人作殊死的斗争。
