    Protest U.S. Bombing of Antung
    [This newspaper Antung news] The entire staff of the state-owned Antung Paper Mill held a protest rally of more than two thousand people on the 25th of this month. The workers unanimously expressed their intolerable anger at the U.S. planes' aggressive bombing of Antung. They resolutely stated that they would support Foreign Minister Zhou’s protest and statement with practical actions, resolutely defend the motherland, and avenge the dead compatriots. Li Renpan, director of the labor union, said first: "The blood debt of killing our compatriots must be repaid with blood. We resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's protest and statement, and demand that the American invaders get out of Korea." Worker Wang Jindian said angrily: "This group of inhuman Americans has repeatedly violated our airspace. The blood of our compatriots killed and wounded has not yet dried, and the hatred has not yet been avenged. Now they have come to bomb and injure three of us, destroying many of our houses, and not even allowing the radishes and cabbages we have worked so hard to grow. The vegetable garden is blown up into big pits. We must settle this account with them. Please tell Foreign Minister Zhou that we must take revenge!" Li Zhongsheng, the representative of the Wooden Cauldron Group, said: "Our representatives must go to the UN to reason with them. Whoever invades us, we will fight to the end." Zuo Wenhua, a worker in the hemp pulp workshop of the Second Branch, said: "We saw the atrocities of the American devils with our own eyes. The bombs damaged fifty or sixty pieces of glass and more than twenty light bulbs in our factory. The glass shards cut our worker brothers, directly hindering our production and costing us several tens of millions of yuan. We firmly demand that American imperialism compensate for the losses." He also announced to all workers that in order to respond to the American aggressors with practical actions, he had strived to become the Ma Hengchang group. Technical worker Wu Zhibin said: "The atrocities of the American invaders are becoming more and more fierce, but I want to tell them that atrocities cannot threaten us. We have strength, we resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's protest, and demand that the United Nations General Assembly immediately take effective sanctions against the American invaders and get out of Korea!"
