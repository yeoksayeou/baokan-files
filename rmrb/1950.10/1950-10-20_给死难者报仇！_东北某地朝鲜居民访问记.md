　　"Avenge the Dead!"
    ——A Visit to Korean Residents in a Certain Area of Northeast China
    Liu Wenyu
    In the evening, I followed the main road and visited several Korean households in Dongshaoguo Village. In the autumn countryside, joyful songs of harvest resonated everywhere. A large cart loaded with radishes came towards me, the driver cracking his whip with loud "snap" sounds. When he saw me, he picked up a big, red radish and said, "Comrade, look how big it is!" After arriving at Dongshaoguo Village, I easily inquired about the courtyard where they lived. As I approached the courtyard entrance, several dogs began to bark wildly. At that moment, a young man of about twenty-six or twenty-seven years old ran out of the courtyard, smiling at me. "Comrade, you've arrived!" he said, pulling me into the courtyard. The courtyard was very spacious, with four stacks of rice, and three rice threshing machines placed next to them, indicating they were in the middle of threshing. Strings of red peppers, dried corn, and yellow tobacco hung under the eaves of the upper and lower houses, giving one a sense of Korean ethnic flavor at a glance.

    Inside the house, six or seven people were studying together. When they saw me, they all stood up to offer me a seat. At this time, I explained the purpose of my visit to them. The person who led me in translated my words. Then, he said, "My surname is Wu, and my name is Tianshu. The one on the kang (platform bed) is my father." Then they all sat down. Although the old man was over sixty years old, he was very strong. I started chatting with him. I learned that there were a total of five Korean families living here, three families with the surname Wu and two families with the surname Jin. The more than twenty of them were cultivating twenty acres of paddy fields. We talked about this year's harvest, and everyone seemed very excited. "This year is a bumper harvest, the yield is much better than last year. Comrade, look how great this rice is!" The old man pointed to the rice stacks outside and asked me to look. Then, he said with a smile, "Good harvest, one hectare can yield twenty dan (approximately 2000 kg)!" Everyone was immersed in the joyful atmosphere of this abundant year, their faces filled with smiles. So I said, "Since the harvest is good, you should study hard!" They took out the book they had been looking at just now and said, "This is the 'People' magazine of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea." I didn't recognize Korean, but it reminded me of the topic, and I asked, "Do you know about the situation of the Korean War?" Immediately, they all showed concern. Wu Tianshu said, "This year's harvest is good, we must pay more public grain to support our army!" The old man also said, "With our General Kim Il-sung leading us, we will definitely win!" They were concerned about the fate of their homeland and deeply believed in the final victory of the people of their homeland!

    A woman carrying a child came in from the outer room and talked to the old man for a while—presumably about inviting me to eat. So I said, "You eat! I've already eaten." They didn't believe that I had already eaten. They set the table and brought seven sets of bowls and chopsticks. I felt very strange; they said there were four people, why did they bring seven sets of bowls and chopsticks?

    Three dishes were brought up, including cabbage fried with chili peppers, eggs, and radish stewed with pork, and seven bowls full of steaming white rice were also served. At this time, two people came out from the east room. They also insisted that I eat. After I explained again and again, they began to eat.

    Such good food made me wonder again. I asked, "Do you usually eat such dishes?" They said, "No! Someone came here today." At this time, a girl in the outer room cried. The old man on the kang asked his daughter-in-law to bring the child into the room. The child was dark, fat, and sturdy. He stopped crying when he sat next to his grandfather and ate the snow-white rice. The old man said, "What a coincidence! In July 1948, we went from Panshan County to Fuxin. We encountered Kuomintang American planes at Xinlitun, and a bomb fragment hit this child's head, but he didn't die. Now he has grown so big." Speaking of this, his face showed boundless anger. He said to the child, "Child, remember, you didn't die, but your uncle died under the bombs of Kuomintang planes." Then, he told me, "My eldest son was killed by an American plane exactly two years ago yesterday. These two friends are here to commemorate him!" Hearing this, I finally understood the doubts I had earlier. I also felt very sad. At this time, a young man sitting on the edge of the kang widened his eyes and said, "If we want to have such a good harvest, we must defeat the American imperialist bandits. Today we are working hard to produce and support the front lines, which is also to avenge the dead." Hearing this, I was very moved, and asked, "Have you signed the peace petition?" They all said they had signed it. The old man put down his chopsticks, clenched his fist, and said, "When I was as old as this child, I began to suffer. Later, when the Japanese devils arrived in Korea, they brought me to the Northeast Development Group, where I suffered all kinds of torment. When Japan surrendered, the Kuomintang came, and the situation was still the same. The Communist Party liberated us and made us live a good life. I told the children to work hard and support the front lines, to get this out of my system, and to avenge the dead."

　　“给死难者报仇！”
    ——东北某地朝鲜居民访问记
    刘文玉
    傍晚，我顺着大道，到东烧锅屯访问了几家朝鲜住户。秋天的农村里，到处荡漾着丰收以后的快乐歌声。迎面来了一辆装满萝卜的大车，赶车的，把鞭子甩得“拍拍”作响。他看到我，拿起一个又红又大的萝卜说：“同志，你看多大个呀！”到达东烧锅屯以后，我很顺利地打听到了他们所住的院子。我走到院口的时候，几条狗便狂吠起来。这时，从院里跑出一个二十六、七岁的小伙子，他对我笑着说：“同志来啦！”拉着我进了院子。院子很宽敞，堆着四垛稻子，旁边放了三架打稻机，看样子正在打场呢。上下屋的檐下都挂着一串串的红辣椒、干苞米和黄烟，使人一看就感到一种朝鲜民族的情调。
    屋里正有六、七个人在一起学习。他们看见了我，都站起来让坐。这时我就对他们说明了来意。领我进来的那个人把我的话翻译了一下。然后，他说：“我姓吴，叫天洙。炕里那个是我爸爸。”这时他们都坐下了。那老大爷虽已六十多岁了，身体却很健壮。我便与他拉起话来。我知道这儿一共住着五家朝鲜人，三家姓吴的，两家姓金的。他们二十多人，种着二十天水田。我们谈到了今年的年景，大伙都显得非常兴奋。“今年是丰收哩，年成比去年可强多了。同志，你看这稻子多棒啊！”那老大爷指着外面垛上的稻子叫我看。接着，他又笑着说：“好年景呀，一垧地能打二十石哪！”大伙都陷在这丰年的快乐的气氛里了，脸上堆满了笑容。于是我说：“年景好，你们好好学习吧！”他们就把刚才在看着的那本书拿过来，说：“这是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的‘人民，杂志。”我不认识朝鲜文，但却使我想起了话题，我问道：“你们可知道朝鲜战争的情况吗？”立刻，他们都现出了关注的神色。吴天洙说：“今年丰收，咱们要多交公粮，支援咱们的军队！”老大爷也说：“有咱金日成将军领导一定会打胜仗！”他们关心着祖国的命运，深信着祖国人民的最后胜利！
    从外屋进来一个背着孩子的女人，和那老头说了一会话——大约是谈留我吃饭的事。于是我便说：“你们吃饭吧！我吃过了。”他们都不信我已吃了饭。他们放好桌子，拿来七个人的碗筷。我感到很奇怪，他们说过是四口人，为啥拿七付碗筷呢？
    端上来三样菜，有白菜炒辣椒、鸡蛋和萝卜炖猪肉，又满满地盛上七碗热气腾腾的大米饭。这时从东屋出来了两个人。他们又一定要我吃饭。经我一再说明，他们才开始动筷。
    这样好饭菜又使我奇怪起来。我问：“你们平常也吃这样菜吗？”他们说：“不！今天有人来这。”这时，外屋一个女孩子哭了。炕里的老大爷叫媳妇把孩子抱进屋来。孩子是黑胖而结实的，坐到爷爷跟前就不哭了，吃着雪白的大米饭。老大爷说：“真巧呀！一九四八年的七月，我们从盘山县到阜新，在新立屯那儿遭到国民党的美国飞机，一个炸弹碎片打在这孩子脑袋上，但他没死，现在长得这么大了。”说到这里，他的脸上便现出了无限的愤怒。他对孩子说：“孩子，你记着，你没死，你的大爷却死在国民党飞机炸弹下了。”于是，他又告诉我：“我大儿子就是两年前的昨天给美国飞机炸死的。这两个朋友，就是来追悼他的呀！”我听到这里，才解决了刚才的疑窦。也感到非常难过。这时，一个坐在炕边的小伙子瞪大了眼睛，说：“我们要想过这样好年景，就得打败美帝国主义强盗。今天我们努力生产支援前线，也就是给死者报仇。”我听到这里，非常感动，便问道：“你们在和平书上签了名没有？”他们都说签过了。那老大爷便放下筷子，握着拳头说：“我象这孩子这么大时，就开始受气了。后来日本鬼子到了朝鲜，把我弄到东北开拓团里，使我受尽了折磨。日本投降了，国民党来了，情景仍是一样。共产党把我们解放了，使我们过到了好日子。我告诉孩子们好好干，支援前线，好出我这口气，也给死的报仇。”
