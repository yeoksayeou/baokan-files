　　Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's North China Regional Company is purchasing large quantities of new cotton. As of October 9th, it had purchased more than 457,000 dan of ginned cotton in the entire region, accounting for 89.52% of the total market transactions.

　　This autumn, North China had less rainfall, and cotton was on the market half a month earlier than expected. As a result, some areas experienced slow sales of new cotton, insufficient supply of grain and general merchandise, and some private merchants took the opportunity to manipulate prices. After the regional company manager's meeting of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company in August and the manager's meeting of various professional companies of the Central Trade Department on September 1, various places accepted the lesson of last year's cotton purchase work, in which a large amount of currency was put into the market but the preparation of general merchandise was insufficient, which affected prices. While purchasing cotton, they organized the supply of general merchandise to the countryside. The China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company also established organizations at all levels according to work needs, increasing from 27 branch companies and 58 groups before the start of cotton purchase to 6 provincial and municipal companies, 47 branch companies, and 107 groups, expanding nearly double, and penetrating into the market towns of all major cotton-producing areas. At the same time, various places also organized rural supply and marketing cooperatives to conduct agency purchases, so the cotton market transactions tended to be normal. Xinxiang City, Pingyuan Province, established a joint purchase committee to ensure market stability.

　　In order to organize food, general merchandise, coal, salt, yarn, cloth and other physical goods during the purchase of cotton, the professional companies and supply and marketing cooperatives in North China made great efforts to cooperate with the purchase of cotton and stabilize market prices. The currency recovered by the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company through the promotion of yarn sales accounted for 64.3% of the total currency put into the market by the company during the cotton purchase period. The supply and marketing cooperatives in Fenyang, Taiyuan, and Yuncheng in Shanxi Province, and Shenze, Anguo, Jize, Fucheng in Hebei Province, and Anyang in Pingyuan Province, used grain and cloth to pre-purchase cotton, ensuring that cotton farmers would not suffer losses due to fluctuations in cotton prices.

　　Due to the better cooperation of all parties and the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's correct grasp of price policies, cotton prices in the cotton-producing areas of North China this year, except for a slight increase in Shijiazhuang and Taiyuan from late August to early September, the markets in other major cotton-producing areas have maintained a ratio of one jin of ginned cotton to eight to ten jin of millet. The prices of various industrial products have also not fluctuated since the start of cotton purchase.

　　华北大量收购新棉
    各方面密切配合，正确掌握价格政策，今年购棉未引起物价波动。
    【新华社十五日讯】中国花纱布公司华北区公司正大量收购新棉，截至十月九日为止，已在全区购进皮棉四十五万七千多担，占市场成交总量的百分之八十九点五二。
    华北区今秋雨水较少，棉花比预期提早半个月上市，因之某些地区曾发生新棉滞销，粮食百货供应不及，以及部分私商乘机操纵等现象。经八月间花纱布公司区公司经理会议和九月一日中央贸易部各专业公司经理会议以后，各地接受去年购棉工作中投放大量货币而百货准备不足以致影响物价的教训，在收购棉花同时，组织百货下乡。花纱布公司并根据工作需要，建立各级机构，由购棉开始前的二十七个分支公司、五十八个小组，增加到六个省市公司、四十七个分支公司、一百零七个小组，扩大几及一倍，深入到所有主要产棉区的集镇；同时，各地并组织农村供销合作社进行代购，因此棉市交易趋于正常。平原省新乡市则成立了联购委员会，以保证市场的稳定。
    华北区各专业公司与供销合作社为了在购棉中组织粮食、百货、煤、盐、纱布等实物，曾经尽了很大的努力，配合购棉稳定市场物价。仅花纱布公司经推销纱布所回笼的货币即占该公司在购棉期内投放货币总量的百分之六十四点三。山西省汾阳、太原、运城，河北省深泽、安国、鸡泽、阜城，平原省安阳等地供销合作社，则以粮食和布匹等预购棉花，保证了棉农不因棉价涨落而遭受损失。
    由于各方配合较好和花纱布公司正确地掌握了价格政策，所以今年华北产棉区棉价，除石家庄、太原于八月下旬至九月上旬曾稍微上升以外，其他主要产棉区市场都保持在一斤皮棉合八斤到十斤小米的比价，各种工业品价格在购棉开始以来也未有波动。
