Hebei Jinmen Canal Project Office Rectification Focuses on Inspecting Canal Project Plans
Unrealistic Plans Result in Monthly Failures to Complete

[Our Newspaper] The Jinmen Canal Project Office in Hebei Province, during its rectification campaign, has focused on inspecting and summarizing its work over the past six months, affirming its achievements and examining the formulation and execution of the canal project plans.

The Jinmen Canal is the largest canal in Hebei Province, planned to irrigate 350,000 mu of land. Since construction began this spring, under the correct leadership of superiors and the efforts of everyone, significant achievements have been made, overcoming difficulties such as a short timeframe, large work area, insufficient cadres, and poor technical conditions. During the spring construction, over 12,000 civilian laborers from Zhuoxian, Gu'an, and Yongqing counties, as well as soldiers from a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army, completed 1.2 million cubic meters of earthwork. Wages totaled 2.42 million jin of millet. Sluice gate construction was also completed during the difficult rainy season. In terms of general affairs, the procurement and supply of over 8,000 tons of materials were completed, and 1,000 tons of cement were safely stored through the rainy season. During the construction process, appropriate modifications were made to the original plan based on specific circumstances, reducing earthwork costs by 1.41 million jin of millet. In the canal excavation, drainage ditches were combined with borrow pits to drain rainwater, which guaranteed the harvest of over 3 million jin from more than 70,000 mu of cultivated land this summer.

Although a large amount of construction was completed in the past six months, the plan was not completed 100% in any single month. Therefore, the plan itself and the organization and execution of the plan were identified as the focus of the inspection.

First, from the plan itself: The reason for the errors was that there was a lack of thorough investigation and research before deciding on the plan, and the plan was formulated in a rough and careless manner, or even irresponsibly. For example, the end of the East Main Canal could not be excavated because of a lack of investigation into the lower reaches of the spillway river, resulting in no outlet for the water. The top of the East Third Sluice Gate wall was six centimeters too high, and there was a drop in the East Fourth Sluice Gate. The designed water flow was 23 cubic meters per second, but the actual flow of the main canal was only 10 cubic meters per second, more than twice the difference from the original plan. The design was wrong, and the reviewers did not notice it. These two items alone wasted more than 29,000 jin of millet.

Poorly planned schedules affect construction timelines, leading to passive work. The most typical example is that the engineering department proposed needing 650,000 bricks for material preparation this spring, and 540,000 have been used so far. After recalculating, another 900,000 are needed. This is mainly because the bricks used for culverts and gate towers were not included in the initial calculation. The engineering officer in charge at the time thought that "the bricks used for gate towers are limited, no more than one or two thousand bricks per gate tower," but in fact, an average gate tower requires 18,000 bricks. Now they have to both fire new bricks and purchase old bricks. Although it will not delay the progress of the project, the quality and size vary, which has an impact on the project.

Plans that are not practical inevitably lead to waste and increase difficulties in the work. For example, the East Second Retrogression Sluice Gate was excavated according to the drawings and actually dug into the spillway river, so it had to be moved back six meters, resulting in some earthwork being done in vain. The original design was to compact the foundation with gray soil, but no investigation was made into the groundwater level beforehand, so a large number of foundation piles had to be used temporarily after the earthwork began, disrupting the procurement plan.

Failure to fully estimate objective difficulties when making plans is also one of the reasons why plans cannot be completed on schedule. For example, when signing the contracting contracts, only 45 days were planned for a 40-day project, but later it rained for 16 days, making it impossible to complete the work on schedule. In terms of brick transportation, the locations for transporting to the construction site were not planned and allocated before the rainy season. After the rainy season came, it was difficult to transport, resulting in 70,000 to 80,000 bricks still unable to be transported out of the kiln, which affected the use of the project.

Second, in terms of implementing the plan: The plan was not mastered by the majority of cadres and workers, so it was rarely able to be completed. Monthly plans, quarterly plans, and half-year plans were all formulated by a small number of leading cadres. Beforehand, they rarely absorbed opinions from the lower levels, and afterwards, they failed to mobilize everyone to discuss and supplement them. They just "printed" and "distributed" them and failed to convey and arrange them properly through a certain meeting. For example, the problem of awarding models for meritorious service in the spring construction. After receiving the notice from the Provincial Spring Construction Committee, because they did not understand the situation below, they just blindly copied a set of instructions with very little substance. The lower levels reflected that the problem could not be solved, and later the office issued a supplementary notice, but there was no follow-up on the result. The canal embankment tree planting plan was even more unfinished. The project office made a plan, and the county government issued two instructions, but it did not specifically organize or check and promote it. As a result, only dozens of the planned 130,000 trees were completed.

Insufficient preparation. The organization, publicity, and tool preparation for civilian laborers were very poor before the spring construction, resulting in hurried and hasty preparations before construction and confusion and waste after construction began. When 900 people came from the third district of Gu'an, 600 of them did not have work baskets, which greatly affected work efficiency.

There is also a lack of in-depth and systematic inspection in the implementation of the plan. When inspecting the work, there was a lack of research beforehand, the purpose of the inspection was unclear, and the problems found were limited to "making suggestions." It failed to improve through a certain meeting. The leaders' notebooks were full of problems, but they were mostly fragmented and lacked sorting and analysis, so they could not propose methods to improve the work based on the inspection. During the spring construction, after discovering that the unit price for difficult work was low, which affected the enthusiasm of civilian laborers, no adjustment method was proposed for a long time, causing the masses to complain that "it is good to do more work and get more rice, but it is difficult to do less work and get less rice." Moreover, inspections are not frequent and cannot make the work constantly improve. For example, it was found that the quality of the Banbidian Sluice Gate was not good enough, and the construction details could not be implemented. Although opinions were expressed at the time, instructions were issued, and the "Construction Details" were reprinted, there was no continued inspection as to whether it was improved. According to later understanding, the reprinted "Construction Details" were still placed in rolls in the construction office. As for organizing mass inspections, it was even worse. Although an inspection report system was also stipulated, it was never adhered to.

Third, in terms of leadership style, "small things cannot be let go, but big things cannot be grasped." Leading cadres are accustomed to solving problems piece by piece, but are not good at studying and grasping the important links in the current work. "Break through one point and guide the whole" has been the experience of many years of construction, but the project office has always adopted the "one-size-fits-all" leadership method. For example, when repairing sluice gates, a dozen sluice gates were started at the same time. The content of the work was similar, and it was urgent to learn from each other and exchange experiences, but the project office and each institute failed to deeply lead one sluice gate, learn from the experience, and guide other places.

Due to the serious bureaucratic work style in the leadership, great losses have been caused to the work. The current project office is studying specific improvement methods and formulating new systems to ensure continuous improvement of work.

　　河北金门渠工程处整风中
    着重检查渠道工程计划
    计划不切实际以致每月均未完成
    【本报讯】河北省金门渠工程处在整风中有重点地检查总结了半年来的工作，肯定了成绩，检查了该渠道工程计划的制定和执行情况。
    金门渠是河北省最大的渠道，计划浇地三十五万亩。今春开始兴修以来，在上级的正确领导和大家的努力下，克服了期限短、工区大、干部不足、技术条件低劣等困难，做出了显著成绩。在春工中，组织涿县、固安、永清三县民工，以及人民解放军某团军工一万二千余人，完成一百二十万公方土工。计工资米二百四十二万斤。并在施工困难的雨季中完成了闸工。总务工作方面，完成了八千余吨的采购供应任务，并保管一千吨洋灰，安全度过雨季。在施工过程中，根据具体情况，对原计划做了适当的修改，缩减土方工费小米一百四十一万斤。在开渠中结合排水沟通取土坑，用来排雨水，已保证了今夏七万多亩耕地的三百万斤的收成。
    半年来，虽然修建了很大数量的工程，但是却没有一个月能百分之百的完成计划，因此，便把计划本身及计划的组织执行，确定为检查的重点。
    第一、从计划本身看：错误的原因是，在决定计划之先，既缺乏周密的调查研究，在制定计划时，又是粗枝大叶，甚或不负责任。如东干渠尾因对泄水河下游缺乏调查，结果因水无出路而无法开挖。东三分水闸墙顶高了六公寸，东四分水闸跌水。过水量计划二十三秒公方，实际干渠流量才十秒公方，距原计划相差一倍多。设计错了，审核的也没看出。只以上两项，即浪费小米二万九千多斤。
    计划不周密，影响施工期限，造成工作被动。最典型的是：今春备料中工程科提出需用砖六十五万，到现在已用了五十四万，经重新核算，还需九十万。主要是因为当时未把涵洞、斗门用砖计算在内。当时工程负责同志认为“斗门用砖有限，一个斗门不过一两千砖”，其实一个斗门平均要一万八千块。现在只得一面赶烧，一面收购旧砖。虽不致耽误工程进行，但质量、尺寸参差不齐，对工程是有影响的。
    计划不切合实际，必然造成浪费并增加工作中的困难。如东二退水闸，按图开挖，竟挖到泄水河身去了，因而只得退回了六公尺，致一部分土方白做了。原设计基础打灰土，但事先对地下水位未做调查，致在土工开工以后，临时改用大批基桩，打乱了采购计划。
    做计划时未能充分估计客观困难，也是使计划不能按期完成的原因之一。如订包工合同时，四十个工作日的工程，只计划了四十五天，但后来下了十六天雨，使工作不能按期完成。运砖方面，雨季前未能有计划的分配好地点运送工地，雨季到来后不好运送，致使七、八万块砖现在还运不出窑地，影响了工程上的使用。
    第二，在执行计划方面：计划不能为多数干部和工人所掌握，以致很少能够完成。月度计划、季度计划、半年计划等，都是由少数领导干部制定，事先既很少吸收下层意见，事后又未能发动大家讨论补充，只是“印”、“发”了事，未能通过一定会议，好好传达、布置。如春工中立功奖模问题，在接到省春工委员会的通知之后，由于对下面情况了解不够，便只照猫画虎地写了一套指示，内容很少充实。下面反映解决不了问题，后来处里又发了一次补充通知，至于结果如何，就没有下文了。渠堤植树计划更是有头无尾。工程处做出计划，县政府发了两次指示，既未具体组织，又未检查推动，结果十三万株树的计划，只完成了几十株。
    准备工作不够，春工中事先对民工的组织、宣传和工具准备都很差，形成开工前的急忙仓促和开工后的混乱浪费。固安三区来了九百人，竟有六百人没有工篮子，工作效率大受影响。
    执行计划中又缺乏深入系统地检查。检查工作时，事先缺乏研究，检查目的不清楚，发现了问题，也只限于“提提意见”，未能通过一定会议，研究改进。领导者的小本子里问题不少，但多是零零碎碎，缺乏整理分析，不能很好的根据检查，提出改进工作的办法。春工中，发觉了难工单价低、影响民工积极性后，很长时间没有提出调整办法，使群众发出了“活好做多得米，活难做少得米”的怨言。而且检查不经常，不能使工作不断改进。如发现半壁店闸工质量不够，施工细则不能贯彻执行，虽然当时也曾提过意见，发过指示，重印过“施工细则”，但，改进与否，便没有继续检查。据后来了解，重印的“施工细则”，有的仍是成卷地放在施工所里。至于组织群众性的检查，则是更差。虽然也规定了检查报告制度，但始终没有坚持。
    第三、领导作风上“小事放不开，大事抓不住”。领导干部习惯于枝枝节节的解决问题，却不善于研究和抓住当前工作中的重要环节。“突破一点，指导全面”已是多年施工的经验，工程处却老是采用“一铺面”的领导方法。例如修闸时，十来个闸一起动工，工作内容差不多，亟应互相观摩交流经验，可是工程处和各所都未能深入领导一个闸，吸取经验，指导别处。
    由于领导上存在着严重的官僚主义作风，工作上造成很大损失。现工程处正在研究具体改进办法，制定新的制度，保证不断的改进工作。
