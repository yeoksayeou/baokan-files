　　Supporting the Soviet Union's Peace Proposals
    Cheng Qian
    The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace has been established for one year. This congress was born at the same time as the People's Republic of China, which is of special significance to the Chinese people's revolution.

    The birth of New China signifies that the nearly 500 million Chinese people have stood up from their enslaved position. In the past year, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have begun to engage in the great work of democratic reform and peaceful construction, and have achieved brilliant successes and development. The Sino-Soviet New Treaty of great historical significance has not only consolidated the friendly relations between the two countries, providing us with a strong guarantee for unreserved construction, but has also promoted the struggle of oppressed people around the world for peace and democracy. Under these circumstances, China's work in defending peace over the past year has also achieved brilliant successes and development. Therefore, it has made an indelible contribution to the cause of world peace.

    We, the Chinese people, have suffered from the destruction of long-term wars and deeply hate war. We firmly demand peace. We deeply know that our independence and autonomy were obtained through years of anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles. In the future, we must still contribute solid strength and must firmly stand on the side of the democratic and peaceful camp headed by the Soviet Union in order to strive for peace and safeguard peace.

    Now the US imperialists are actively creating war and have already armed aggression against Korea and Taiwan, and also bombed the border of Northeast China. This is a direct destruction of world peace. Our Foreign Minister Zhou has filed a complaint with the United Nations. The United Nations has the sacred task of maintaining peace. Can it turn a blind eye and distort and conceal such crimes of the US imperialism? In order to save humanity from catastrophe and defend world peace, we should enthusiastically support the declaration on consolidating world peace and security put forward by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky at the UN General Assembly. We must do everything possible to stop the war threat of US imperialism. Victory will always belong to the people who defend peace.

　　拥护苏联的和平提案
    程潜
    中国保卫世界和平大会成立一周年了。这个大会是与中华人民共和国同时诞生的，这点对于中国人民的革命是特别有意义的。
    新中国的诞生，标志着近五亿人口的中国人民已从被奴役的地位站立起来。一年来，中国人民在毛主席领导之下，已开始从事伟大的民主改革与和平建设的工作，而且都得到了辉煌的成就和发展。具有伟大历史意义的中苏新约，不仅巩固了两国的友好关系，使我们获得放手建设有力的保障，而且更推动了全世界被压迫人民争取和平民主的斗争。在这种情况下，中国和大一年来的保卫和平的工作，便也有了辉煌的成就和发展。因此，它对世界和平事业，提供了不可磨灭的贡献。
    我们中国人民受过长期战争的破坏，是深切痛恨战争的。我们坚决要求和平。我们深深知道我们的独立自主，是经过多年的反帝反封建斗争才获得的。今后我们仍要拿出坚实的力量，并且必须坚定地站在以苏联为首的民主和平阵线一边。才能争取和平，保障和平。
    现在美帝国主义者正在积极制造战争，并且已经武装侵略朝鲜、台湾，并还轰炸我国东北的边境，这是对世界和平的直接破坏。我国周外长已向联合国提出控诉，联合国负有维持和平的神圣任务，对于美帝这样罪行，还能熟视无睹，歪曲掩饰吗？为了挽救人类的浩劫，保卫世界的和平，我们更应热烈拥护苏外长维辛斯基在联大会议上提出的巩固世界和平与安全的宣言。我们要尽一切可能有的力量，来制止美帝国主义的战争威胁，胜利永远属于保卫和平的人民。
