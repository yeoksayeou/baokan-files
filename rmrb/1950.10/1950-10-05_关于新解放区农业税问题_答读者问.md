　　On the Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas
    Answers to Readers' Questions

    Many readers have written, raising numerous questions regarding the Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas (hereinafter referred to as the Provisional Regulations). We have now asked the Agricultural Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government to respond as follows.
                  —Editor

    [1] Question: Article 11 of the Provisional Regulations stipulates that "If the number of taxpaying households is less than 90% of the number of agricultural households, the tax threshold may be lowered to 120 catties." What is the reasoning behind this? What is the relationship between the tax threshold and the coverage rate (percentage of taxpaying households to agricultural households)? If the number of taxpaying households is still less than 90% of the number of agricultural households after the tax threshold is lowered to 120 catties, what should be done?

    Answer: The size of the coverage rate depends on the height of the tax threshold. If the tax threshold is high, the number of taxpaying households will be small (i.e., the coverage rate is small); if the tax threshold is low, the number of taxpaying households will be large (i.e., the coverage rate is large). Based on the existing survey materials from rural areas in the new areas, it is estimated that the coverage rate in general areas will reach 90%. In a few barren areas, where income is lower, the number of taxpaying households may be less than 90% of the number of agricultural households, and the tax threshold must be lowered to 120 catties. The so-called lowering is a gradual decrease from 150 catties, such as lowering it to 140 catties or 130 catties. If the coverage rate can meet 90%, then it does not need to be lowered further, and it does not necessarily have to be lowered to 120 catties. If the coverage rate still cannot reach 90% after the tax threshold is lowered to 120 catties, the tax threshold will no longer be lowered in order to take care of the lives of poor farmers.

    During the Anti-Japanese War, the coverage rate was generally required to reach 80%. Why is it expanded to 90% now? Because during the Anti-Japanese War, in addition to public grain, there were also labor burdens (such as transportation, carrying stretchers, joining the army, and participating in the war). At that time, although poor and hired peasants bore less public grain, they had many labor burdens, which have now been greatly reduced. Secondly, when the national financial situation is still difficult, expanding the coverage rate can easily achieve the effect of many people working together, and at the same time, it is beneficial to unite all classes, which is beneficial to the people.

    [2] Question: The agricultural tax in the newly liberated areas is levied on a progressive basis, based on the average agricultural income per capita of the agricultural population. How can the result of tax calculation according to the tax rate roughly conform to the burden rates of various classes in the new areas mentioned in the People's Daily editorial on September 6?

    Answer: The agricultural tax rate in the newly liberated areas is formulated based on the general income of various classes in the newly liberated areas. According to survey materials, the income of middle peasants in general new areas is around 600 catties, and their tax rate is generally around 13%. This burden rate is suitable for the affordability of middle peasants. In general areas, the burden rate for poor peasants is generally around 8%, for middle peasants generally around 13%, for rich peasants generally around 20%, and for landlords generally around 30%, with a maximum of no more than 50%, and for special households no more than 80%. However, it must also be explained that the income of each class is complicated. For example, the income of some wealthy middle peasants may be equal to or exceed that of some small rich peasants, and the income of some upper poor peasants may not be lower than that of middle peasants. Therefore, the result of calculating the tax according to the income rate can only be roughly consistent, but it is impossible to be completely consistent. Prosperous areas will inevitably exceed the general standard, and barren areas will inevitably be lower than the general standard. Some purely agricultural areas with few people and much land, although they should be taken care of, their burden will also exceed the general standard. This phenomenon is permitted by the policy.

    [3] Question: The People's Daily editorial on September 6 said that the burden rate for landlords should not exceed 50%, but the highest tax rate on the tax rate table is only 42%. How is this calculated?

    Answer: The average annual agricultural income per capita on the tax rate table refers to income from self-cultivation. According to the provisions of Article 15 of the regulations, tenant farming income or rental income must first be converted (tenant farming income of 100 catties is calculated as 80 catties, and rental income of 100 catties is calculated as 120 catties, because tenant farming income does not include investment, and rental income does not include investment). Then, the tax is calculated according to the tax rate. In this way, the highest tax rate for rental households reaches 50%. For example, the rental income of a landlord is 3,411 catties. Calculated at 100 catties as 120 catties, the converted income is 4,093.2 catties. Calculated at 42%, the burden is 1,719.14 catties, accounting for 50.4% of its actual rental income.

    [4] Question: Why should the land acreage, yield, population, and tax payable of taxpaying households be verified by the county (city) people's government? What issues should be paid attention to during verification?

    Answer: In terms of burden, there will inevitably be cases of falsely reporting the population, concealing land acreage, and underreporting yields, or due to inaccurate investigations and unfair assessments by district and township governments, causing truthfully reporting households to suffer losses and falsely reporting households to benefit. In order to overcome these shortcomings, Article 17 of the Provisional Regulations stipulates that the tax amount reported by the county (city) people's government should be verified.

    When carrying out the work of verifying the tax amount, the county (city) people's government should first pay attention to whether the land acreage, yield, and population of the taxpaying households or villages are true. When necessary, investigation and joint village comparison methods should be adopted to obtain a true balance of land yield. Especially when reviewing the tasks assigned to districts or townships, attention must be paid to the concentration or dispersion of land in each village and the situation of tenancy relations. In areas where land is relatively concentrated, most of the agricultural income belongs to the landlord, the tax rate is higher, that is, the amount of collection is larger; conversely, if the land is scattered and the income per capita is about the same, the tax rate is lower, and the amount of collection is smaller. Therefore, it is blind to allocate tasks by only paying attention to the total amount of land and the total output of each village. In addition, tenancy relations (that is, the ratio of land rent shared by landlords and tenants) should also be paid attention to.

    [5] Question: Why should landlords participate in the township (village) agricultural tax investigation and evaluation committee?

    Answer: The township (village) agricultural tax investigation and evaluation committee is an institution under the leadership of the township (village) people's government. The reason why this institution needs the participation of landlords is not to give them the rights enjoyed by the people, but to require them to abide by the obligations of citizens. For this reason, landlords must understand the laws and regulations on the issue of burden, reduce their fears and have the opportunity to express their opinions. Doing so, on the one hand, can ensure that the burden on landlords does not exceed their affordability, and on the other hand, it prevents landlords from evading the burden. This is beneficial to the collection work.

    [6] Question: For land where rent has not been reduced in accordance with the law, in addition to the owner's income being taxed according to the tax rate for rental income and paid by the owner, the tenant's income is taxed at a rate of 9% and also paid by the owner. Is the tenant's income also calculated at 80 catties per 100 catties? What is the basis for the 9% tax rate?

    Answer: The tenant's income refers to the remaining part after deducting the rent from the normal annual yield of the land. The calculation is no longer converted, and the tax can be calculated at a tax rate of 9%. For example, if the tenant's income is 100 catties, the landlord will pay 9 catties on his behalf.

    The 9% tax rate is stipulated based on the principle of taking care of both the owner and the tenant, being generally fair and reasonable, and being simple and easy to implement. According to the materials calculated from the survey, the general burden of tenant poor peasants, tenant middle peasants, and tenant rich peasants accounts for about 10% of their total income. In order to take care of tenant poor peasants and prevent them from suffering too much loss due to the deduction of the portion paid on their behalf when returning the rent, it is set at 9%. Although tenant rich peasants benefit somewhat and tenant poor peasants suffer some losses, it guarantees that tenants will receive considerable benefits from rent reduction, and that landlords will still have considerable surplus grain after paying taxes and returning rent.

    [7] Question: If the owner does not collect rent for the land, according to Article 16, the burden of the income that should be received should be paid by the tenant on his behalf. Should that income be calculated at 120 catties per 100 catties? How should the tax rate be calculated?

    Answer: For land rented out by the owner, regardless of whether rent is collected or not, when calculating the burden, the rent that should be received is calculated at 120 catties per 100 catties. The calculation of this tax rate should convert the income of the owner and the income of the tenant separately to obtain the total converted income of the entire household. The tax rate payable for the part of the owner who does not collect rent should be divided by the actual agricultural population of the owner to obtain the average converted income per capita. The tax should be calculated according to this income and paid by the tenant on his behalf.

    [8] Question: Article 13 of the Provisional Regulations stipulates that the agricultural income of schools, orphanages, ancestral halls, associations, etc., cannot be calculated based on the average population. Should the rental income also be converted according to the regulation of 120 catties per 100 catties for tax calculation?

    Answer: The tax calculation methods for self-cultivation, employment management, and rental of various cultivated lands stipulated in Clauses 1, 2, and 3 of Article 13 of the Provisional Regulations have already been differentiated in the tax rate, and the income is no longer converted. For example, if a school rents out ten acres of land and collects rent of 1,000 catties, it should be taxed at 10%, which is 100 catties.

　　关于新解放区农业税问题
    答读者问
    许多读者来信，提出了不少有关新解放区农业税暂行条例的问题。现请中央人民政府财政部农业税处答复如下。
                  ——编者
    【一】问：新解放区农业税暂行条例（以下简称暂行条例）第十一条中规定“纳税户不及农业户百分之九十者，其起征点得递降至一百二十市斤”，是什么道理？起征点与负担面（纳税户数占农业户数百分比）有什么关系？如果起征点降低到一百二十市斤后，纳税户仍不到农业户百分之九十，又怎么办？
    答：负担面的大小，决定于起征点的高低。起征点高了，纳税户就少了（即负担面小了）；起征点规定低了，纳税户多了（即负担面大了）。根据现有新区农村调查材料看来，估计一般地区负担面都会达到百分之九十。少数贫瘠地区，收入较少，纳税户可能不及农业户百分之九十，须将起征点递降到一二○市斤。所谓递降就是从一五○市斤依次下降，如降低到一四○市斤或一三○市斤，负担面能符合百分之九十时即可不再降，不一定要降到一二○市斤。如果起征点降低到一二○市斤后，负担面仍不能达到百分之九十时，为了照顾贫苦农民的生活，起征点就不再降了。
    抗战时期，负担面一般要求达到百分之八十。现在为什么扩大到百分之九十呢？因为抗日战争时期，除公粮外，还有劳力负担（如运输、抬担架、参军、参战等），当时贫雇农负担公粮虽少，但劳役负担却很多，现在则大大减少了；其次在国家财政状况还是有困难的时候，扩大负担面易收众擎易举之效，同时又有利于团结各阶层，对人民是有好处的。
    【二】问：新解放区农业税是以户为单位，按农业人口每人平均农业收入累进计征。按税率计征结果，怎么会大体上符合九月六日人民日报社论中所说的新区各阶层负担率呢？
    答：新解放区农业税率，是依据新解放区各阶层一般收入而制定的。根据调查材料，一般新区中农收入在六百斤上下，其税率一般在百分之十三上下，这个负担率是适合中农负担能力的。在一般地区执行的结果，大体上说，贫农负担率一般是百分之八左右，中农一般是百分之十三左右，富农一般是百分之二十左右，地主一般是百分之三十左右，最高不超过百分之五十，特别户则不超过百分之八十。但是还须说明：各阶层的收入是错综的，例如某些富裕中农的收入，可能等于或超过某些小富农，某些上贫农的收入，也可能不低于中农。因此，按收入依率计征的结果，只能做到大体上符合，而不可能完全符合。富庶地区，必然超过一般标准，贫瘠地区，必会低于一般标准。某些地多人少的纯农业区，虽应加以照顾，其负担亦会超过一般标准，这种现象是政策所容许的。
    【三】问：九月六日人民日报社论上说，地主负担率最高不超过百分之五十，可是税率表上最高税率只达百分之四十二，这是如何计算的？
    答：税率表上的每人平均全年农业收入，指的是自耕收入。根据条例第十五条的规定，佃耕收入或出租收入，要先经过折算（佃耕收入一百斤作八十斤计，出租收入一百斤作一百二十斤计，因为佃耕收入，里面未扣除投资，出租收入则是不包括投资的纯收入。）然后，再依税率计征。这样，出租户的最高税率是达到百分之五十的。例如，某户地主的出租收入是三、四一一斤，按一百斤作一百二十斤计，则折合收入为四、○九三·二斤，按百分之四十二计征，负担为一、七一九·一四斤，占其实收租额的百分之五○·四。
    【四】问：纳税户的土地亩数、产量、人口、和应交税额为什么要经过县（市）人民政府核定？核定时应注意些什么问题呢？
    答：在负担上，难免有虚报人口，隐瞒地亩，少报产量的事情，或因区、乡政府调查不实，评定不公，使实报户吃亏，虚报户沾光。为了克服这些缺点，所以暂行条例第十七条规定由县（市）人民政府核定所报税额。
    县（市）人民政府进行核定税额工作时，首先应注意纳税户或村的地亩、产量、人口是否真实，必要时还要采取调查，联村评比的方法，求得土地产量的真实平衡。尤其在审查分配给区或乡的任务时，必须注意各村土地集中或分散和租佃关系的情况。土地比较集中的地区，农业收入，大部归地主所有，税率较高，亦即征收数量较大；相反的，土地分散，每人收入差不多，税率则较低，征收数量即较小。所以只注意各村的土地总数和总产量而分配任务是带有盲目性的。此外，租佃关系（即地主和佃户分益的比例数）也应加以注意。
    【五】问：乡（村）农业税调查评议委员会为什要要有地主参加？
    答：乡（村）农业税调查评议委员会是乡（村）人民政府领导下的机构。这个机构要有地主参加的原因，并不是给他们享受人民的权利，而是需要使他们遵守国民的义务。为此，就要使地主在负担问题上了解法令，减少疑惧，和有发表意见的机会。这样做，一方面可使地主负担不超过其负担能力，另方面又使地主不能逃避负担。这在征收工作上是有好处的。
    【六】问：未依法减租的土地，除业主收入部分按出租收入依税率计征，由业主交纳外，佃户收入部分按百分之九的税率计征，也由业主交纳，那么佃户收入部分是否每百斤也作八十斤计算？百分之九的税率是根据什么规定的？
    答：佃户收入部分是指按土地常年应产量减去租额后的剩余部分，计算时不再折合，以百分之九的税率计算即可。例如佃户收入部分一百斤，则由地主代交税额九斤。
    百分之九的税率是根据照顾业佃双方，大体公平合理，而又简便易行的原则规定的。据调查的材料计算，佃贫农、佃中农、佃富农一般的负担约占其总收入百分之十左右。为照顾佃贫农在退租时不致因扣除代缴部分而吃亏太大，故订为百分之九。这样虽然佃富农沾些光，佃贫农吃些亏，但保证了佃户得到减租的相当利益和地主缴税退租后，仍有相当余粮。
    【七】问：业主不收租的土地，其应收入部分的负担，按第十六条规定，应由佃户代为交纳，则该收入部分是否每百斤应作一百二十斤计算？其税率应如何计算？
    答：业主出租的土地，不问是否收租，计算负担时，其应收的租谷，每百市斤按一百二十市斤计算。该项税率的计算，应将业主出租的收入及佃户的收入，分别加以折合，求出全户总折合收入。业主不收租部分应纳税率，应按业主的实有农业人口去除，得出每人平均折合收入，按此收入查照应纳税率计征，由佃户代为交纳。
    【八】问：暂行条例第十三条规定：学校、孤儿院、祠堂、会社等农业收入不能依人口平均计算者，其出租收入是否也要先按一百斤作一百二十斤的规定加以折合计征？
    答：暂行条例第十三条一、二、三款规定的各种耕地的收入，自耕，雇工经营和出租的计征办法，在税率上已经加以区别，收入不再折合。例如某学校出租地十亩，收租一千斤，应征百分之十，即一百斤。
