　　Huaipei Disaster Area Develops Sideline Production
    Relocation and Resettlement of Disaster Victims Concluded
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th] In order to overcome the severe drought in the Huaipei Administrative Region, the People's Government of the region, after leading the disaster victims to complete the plan of replanting 13 million mu of late autumn crops, has organized a large number of disaster victims to engage in various sideline productions, enabling them to find ways to make a living. In Fengtai County, the region already has over 78,000 disaster victims participating in over 5,000 sideline production groups. Currently, it is the peak season for fish production, and in counties along the Huai River and around Hongze Lake, several thousands to over ten thousand people participate in fishing every day. Disaster victims in mountainous areas are universally engaged in production activities such as quarrying, digging for medicinal herbs, and panning for sand. In Huaiyuan County, near the urban area alone, over 4,000 people rely on panning for sand to make a living. According to statistics, the sideline productions organized in various localities, adapting to local conditions and seasonal factors, include dozens of types, such as fishing, making hemp thread, milling flour, quarrying, digging for medicinal herbs, panning for sand (for construction), oil extraction, and mat weaving.

　　In sideline production, the Anhui Branch of the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation has lent 60 million catties of grain through supply and marketing cooperatives in various places to help disaster victims solve the financial difficulties encountered during sideline production. The Huaipei Regional State-owned Aquatic Products Company is also preparing to issue fish loans of 3 million catties of rice in the near future to support fishermen in their production. State-owned trading companies will also systematically purchase sideline products from disaster victims to solve the problem of product sales.
    [Another Dispatch] The work of relocating and resettling the severely affected disaster victims in the Huaipei disaster area has now come to an end. In the Fuyang and Suxian regions, over 150,000 severely affected disaster victims have been transferred and resettled in regions such as Chuxian, Chaohu, and Luan. Together with the disaster victims who fled to Jiangnan and were temporarily taken in and resettled by the local people's governments at the beginning of the flood, there are approximately 200,000 people. Except for the elderly, young children, and the sick who still need the People's Government to provide subsidies for food rations, the majority of the relocated disaster victims, with the enthusiastic assistance of the local people's governments and farmers, have participated in helping with tasks such as cutting rice, cutting grass, herding cattle, and other sideline productions. Many disaster victims are now able to support themselves.

　　皖北灾区副业生产展开
    灾民外移与安置已告一段落
    【新华社上海七日电】皖北行政区人民政府为战胜该区严重灾荒，在领导灾民完成抢种晚秋一千三百万亩的计划后，又组织大批灾民投入各种副业生产，使灾民找到生活门路。该区凤台县已有灾民七万八千余人参加五千多个副业生产小组。目前正是鱼产旺季，沿淮（河）沿湖（洪泽湖）各县，每日参加捕鱼者即有数千人至万余人。靠山地区的灾民，普遍投入打石、挖药材、淘沙等生产，仅怀远县城关附近即有四千余人靠淘沙维持生活。据统计，各地因地因时制宜所已组织的副业生产，有捕鱼、打麻线、磨粉、打石、挖药材、淘沙（供建筑用）打油、编席等数十种。
    在副业生产中，中国粮食公司皖北分公司已通过各地供销合作社，贷放粮食六千万斤，帮助灾民解决副业生产时的资金困难。皖北区国营水产公司也准备最近发放鱼贷三百万斤大米，扶助渔民进行生产。国营贸易公司并将有计划地收购灾民副业产品，解决产品销路问题。
    【又讯】皖北灾区重灾民的外移及安置工作现已告一段落。阜阳、宿县两专区先后转移安置到滁县、巢湖、六安等专区的重灾民已有十五万多人，连同水灾初期逃荒到江南各地，由各该地人民政府临时收容和安置的灾民，共约有二十万人左右。外移的灾民，除老幼及患病者仍须人民政府发给补助口粮外，大部灾民在当地人民政府和农民们的热诚帮助下，已分别参加了帮工割稻、割草、放牛及其他副业生产，许多灾民的生活已能自给。
