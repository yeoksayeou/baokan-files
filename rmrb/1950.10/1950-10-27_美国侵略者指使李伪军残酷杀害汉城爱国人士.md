　　Xinhua News Agency, October 25th: The Li Seung-man army, under the instruction of the American aggressors, is persecuting Korean patriots on a large scale in Seoul. According to a TASS dispatch from New York on the 23rd: The *Compass Daily* recently published a dispatch from its reporter, Martin, in Seoul, reporting on the atrocities of the Li Seung-man army. Martin stated: A wave of terror is sweeping through South Korea. In Seoul, he witnessed South Korean soldiers murdering Korean patriots. "Armed patrols of three to five people are scouring Seoul, seeking out unfortunate victims, accusing them of being 'snipers,' 'spies,' 'pro-Communist elements,' and so on. Many days after Seoul was occupied, the sound of rifles could still be heard in the suburbs and surrounding mountains. When I asked the residents what this gunfire was, people told me that the patrols were executing their prisoners. It is very clear that there is even more bloodshed in the countryside."
    Xinhua News Agency, October 26th: American aggressors and the Li Seung-man lackeys continue to harm the people of Seoul under their occupation. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Seoul on the 24th: The head of the Seoul puppet police department announced on the 24th that since Seoul was occupied, the total number of people arrested is approximately 10,000. Among them, 5,000 will be sent to military tribunals for trial. On the same day, a United Press dispatch from Seoul stated: Among the 125 people being tried by the military tribunal, 62 have already been sentenced to death, and a number of others have been sentenced to life imprisonment. Another dispatch stated that there were also large-scale arrests in other occupied cities.

　　美国侵略者指使李伪军残酷杀害汉城爱国人士
    【新华社二十五日讯】李承晚军队在美国侵略者的指使下，正在汉城大肆迫害朝鲜爱国者。据塔斯社纽约二十三日电：《指南针日报》顷发表该报记者马丁的汉城来讯，报道李承晚军队的暴行。马丁称：恐怖的浪潮正在席卷着南朝鲜。在汉城，他目睹南朝鲜士兵怎样杀害朝鲜的爱国人士。“三五成群的武装巡逻队正在遍搜汉城，找出不幸的牺牲者们，控以‘阻击兵’、‘特务’、‘亲共分子’等等的罪名。汉城被占领许多天以后，在市郊和周围的山中还听到步枪的声音。当我问居民们这是什么枪声时，人们告诉我是巡逻队枪决他们的俘虏们。很明显的，在乡间还有更多的流血事件。”
