　　The Radiance on the Volga River
    Every Soviet person has proudly read the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers; while reading it, they felt ecstatic from the courageous Stalin's thought; while reading it, they thought of this as one of the most vivid proofs of our peaceful and constructive labor. The Soviet people are advancing towards communism with firm steps along a broad road.

    Five years will soon pass, the grasslands will become unrecognizable, the great Russian rivers will cross the grasslands, and in the near future, the light of two Soviet giants will shine on the Volga River. This is the radiance of communism.

    Belton turbines—no capitalist country has such power, it will supply powerful power to many industrial centers and collective farm fields. The Soviet people are changing nature with powerful electricity. This task can only be accomplished by the Soviet people living in our heroic Stalin era.

    The decision on building a hydroelectric power station in Stalingrad stipulates that power will be supplied not only to the city itself, but also to the lowlands near the Caspian Sea, the flooded areas of the Volga and Akhtuba, the Salpinsk lowlands, the black soil zone, and the Nogai steppe.

    The electricity wielded by the skilled hands of the Soviet people will turn the semi-desert area into fertile fields of advanced socialist agriculture.

    As is well known, the Stavropol steppe is adjacent to the areas near the Caspian Sea mentioned in the resolution. The people of Stavropol know what the dry land of the Caspian Sea is like. Therefore, our farmers and herdsmen greet the historic resolution to irrigate the black soil zone and the lowlands near the Caspian Sea with the greatest sense of pride. The people of Stavropol see the tireless care of the Party and the government in the simple and precise sentences of the government's decision. These days, I visited the remote Stavropol steppe area. There, the herdsmen clearly understand what the black soil zone means in our border region's life, and they keenly feel how the simple people's aspirations and the great government plans coincide. There, raising and multiplying rich herds and collective farm herds, people live in the idea of this construction on the Volga River.

    At dusk, we sat by the bonfire. All around were flat grasslands, cicadas chirping. A representative of the Party District Committee read out the decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers. When the conversation ended, it was already night. Protsnev, the hero of Stalingrad, walked up to me, having lived on this grassland for almost half a century.

    He said softly: "I like to fantasize at this time." His eyes turned to the already blurred bonfire, flashing excitedly. "I used to fantasize when I was on the front line. When fighting under Stalingrad, lying in the trenches, just like now, I saw Stalin in my fantasy. He stood beside the map of the heroic city, lost in thought. Now he is also lost in thought. He approached the map and observed the Volga River. He observed, and everyone's gaze turned to the Volga River. But why? Because, I think a new battle has begun next to the glorious city of Stalingrad."

    For a long time, I pondered the sincere words of this sheep herder about Stalin and about the beautiful future of our motherland illuminated by the radiance of the Volga River.

### 伏尔加河上的光芒

　　伏尔加河上的光芒
    每一个苏联人都骄傲地读过了苏联部长会议的决定；在读的时候，从勇敢的斯大林思想，感到了狂喜；在读的时候，想到了这又是我们和平建设性劳动的一个最鲜明的证据。苏联人民正以坚定的步伐沿着广阔的道路，向共产主义迈进。
    五年将很快地过去，草原将变得难以识别，伟大的俄罗斯河流，将穿过草原在不久的将来，两个苏联巨人的火光将在伏尔加河上照耀起来。这是共产主义的光芒。
    贝尔顿轮机——任何资本主义国家都还没有这样的威力，它要把强大的动力供应许多工业中心地区和集体农场的田地。苏联人民以强大的电力改变着大自然。这个任务只有生活在我们英雄的斯大林时代的苏联人民才能胜任。
    关于在斯大林格勒建筑水力发电站的决定中，规定把动力不仅供给本城，而且也供应里海附近的低地，伏尔加，阿哈吐宾的浸水地，萨尔宾低地，黑土地带和诺加伊草原等地。
    苏联人民的灵巧的手所掌握的电力，将把半沙漠地带变成先进的社会主义农业的肥美的田地。
    如所周知，斯达夫罗玻里草原是与决议中所提到的里海附近各区相邻接的。斯达夫罗玻里的人们都知道，什么是里海的干燥地。因此，我们的农夫和畜牧者以最大的骄傲感来迎接灌溉黑土地带和里海附近低地的历史性决议。斯达夫罗玻里人在政府决议的简捷而精确的句子中，看见了党和政府的不倦的关怀。这几天，我访问了遥远的斯达夫罗玻里草原区。那里，畜牧者们都很明白黑土地带在我们边区生活里有着怎样的意义，他们锐敏地感到：纯朴的人民的宿愿和伟大的政府计划是怎样地符合的。在那里，养育着、增殖着丰富的畜群和集体农场畜群，人们都生活在伏尔加河上这个建筑的思想中。
    黄昏我们坐在柴堆旁。四周都是平坦的草原，蝉儿鸣着。党的区委会代表宣读了苏联部长会议的决定。当谈话结束的时候，已是夜间了，斯大林格勒的英雄普罗茨涅夫向我走过来，他在这个草原上生活了几乎半个世纪了。
    他低声说：“我喜欢在这个时候幻想”。他的眼睛转向了已经看不清楚的柴堆上，激动地闪烁着。“我从前在前线的时候也幻想过。在斯大林格勒城下搏斗时，在战壕里躺着时，完全象现在一样，我在幻想中看见了斯大林。他站在英雄城地图旁边沉思着。现在他也在沉思着。他走近地图并观察伏尔加河。他观察着，所有人的视线也就都转向了伏尔加河。可是为什么呢？因为，我认为在光荣的斯大林格勒城旁已开始了新的战斗。”
    我有好久思索着这位畜羊者关于斯大林的，关于伏尔加河的光芒照耀着的我们祖国美丽未来的衷心的话。
