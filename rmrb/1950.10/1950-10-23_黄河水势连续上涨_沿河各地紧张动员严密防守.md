Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 21st -- Since the 13th of this month, continuous autumn rains along the Yellow River have caused the water level to rise continuously. As of 4:00 PM on the 20th, the flow at Tongguan had risen to 4,150 cubic meters per second, and the flow at Gaocun, Dongming in the lower reaches had reached 5,720 cubic meters per second. The riverbed in the Guangwu-Zhengzhou section of Henan Province has been elevated due to siltation from last year's major flood, reducing its capacity. The water level at Huayuankou in this section at 6:00 AM on the 18th was only 1.7 decimeters below the highest flood level of 92.84 meters last year. Due to the excessive and large autumn floods, the scouring of the dike foundations is very severe, with some dam surfaces only 6 or 7 decimeters above the water. Currently, the flood peak is continuing to rise throughout the river. To prevent accidents on the Yellow River, the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters urgently telegraphed flood control organizations at all levels along the river on the 17th, urging them to heighten vigilance, strengthen preparations, and defend closely. At present, the flood control agencies in the Guangwu-Zhengzhou section of the Yellow River have mobilized the entire engineering team and long-term embankment defenders to patrol the dikes in shifts and guard them closely. Flood control headquarters in various districts are also mobilizing reserve flood control personnel, preparing materials, and going to the dikes to carry out emergency repairs.

　　黄河水势连续上涨
    沿河各地紧张动员严密防守
    【新华社开封二十一日电】黄河沿岸自本月十三日以来秋雨连绵，黄河水势连续上涨。截至二十日下午四时止，潼关流量已涨至四千一百五十秒立方公尺，下游东明高村流量已达五千七百二十秒立方公尺。河南省广（武）郑（州）段河床因被去年大水淤垫抬高，容量减小，该段花园口十八日上午六时水位仅比去年最高洪水位九二点八四公尺相差一公寸七。由于今秋洪水过猛而大，冲刷堤根甚剧，有的坝面仅出水六、七公寸。现在全河洪峰仍继续上涨。黄河防汛总指挥部为防备黄河出险，曾于十七日紧急电示沿河各级防汛组织，提高警惕，加强准备，严密防守。目前黄河广（武）郑（州）段防汛机构已动员全段工程队及长期也防员上堤，轮流值夜，严加防守。各区防汛指挥部亦正动员后备防汛员，准备物料，上堤抢护。
