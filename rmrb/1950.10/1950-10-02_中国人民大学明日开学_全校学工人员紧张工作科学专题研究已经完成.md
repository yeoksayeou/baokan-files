　　Renmin University of China to Open Tomorrow
　　Special Research on Scientific Work of All School Staff Completed
　　[This newspaper dispatch] Before National Day, more than four thousand faculty and staff members of Renmin University of China were busily preparing for the celebration of the first National Day and the school's opening ceremony on October 3. The opening of the school will mark the beginning of a great construction in the new higher education after the founding of New China. This university has opened up a new path for the large-scale cultivation of specialized talents for national construction and the training of worker-peasant intellectuals with a high degree of scientific and technological literacy. Renmin University of China has a total of eight departments in its undergraduate program, with more than 1,600 students. There are eleven classes in the specialized course, with more than 1,200 students.
　　In the process of commemorating the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the school carried out a large-scale scientific research work. At the end of August, 39 special topics for scientific reports were proposed, and scientific workers from various teaching and research sections conducted research and wrote papers. It is planned to hold a scientific discussion meeting from October 7th to 9th to make special reports on scientific research. The topics of scientific research focus on the current economic construction of the People's Republic of China. In addition, there are also some special studies on theoretical issues related to law, diplomacy, and the Chinese revolution. The papers also include Professor Gornilov's "Stalin on China," Professor Babaev's "On the Achievements of the People's Republic of China in Finance, Currency, Circulation, Credit, and Foreign Trade," and Professor Chivikova's "On Comrade Stalin's Linguistics." After a month of hard work, these scientific research topics have been basically completed. The teaching and research sections have been holding meetings separately to report their initial drafts of the papers to celebrate this year's National Day. In addition, as another practical action to celebrate the National Day and welcome the 33rd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union, a wide-ranging revolutionary competition campaign is being launched among all school staff. The purpose of the competition is to further improve the quality of work, improve work efficiency, and improve work style. Departments and teaching and research sections will soon launch a heated labor competition. About 800 people are organized in this competition, among which the focus of the competition for teachers is to ensure the improvement of teaching quality and strive to overfulfill the teaching plan. About 100 workers from the three production departments (printing factory, flour factory, clothing factory) participated in the competition, focusing on improving product quality and improving technology. About 80 people, including nurses and childcare workers in the hospital and kindergarten, focus on work attitude, style, and political study as the center of the competition, to improve their work awareness and enthusiasm, strengthen their sense of responsibility to patients and children, and improve their work ability. In addition, about 500 people from the school's transportation, telephone, security personnel, service personnel, cooks, and school workers will all complete their work according to quantitative quotas, and strive to overfulfill the work plan and study plan as the competition goal. This competition is conducted under the leadership of the school's Party committee and the mobilization and organization of the school's labor union. The competition will be held from October 1st to February 7th. (Zhang Xiangyi)
