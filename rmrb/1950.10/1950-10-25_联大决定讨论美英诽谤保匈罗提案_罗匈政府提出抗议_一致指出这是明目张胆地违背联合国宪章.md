Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: According to the Romanian News Agency, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Romanian People's Republic, Mr. Poker, on behalf of the Romanian government, sent a note to the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Andesion, and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Lie, on October 13th. The note strongly protested the United Nations General Assembly's illegal decision to discuss the US-UK group's slander of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania regarding the so-called "violations of human rights." It firmly demanded that the United Nations General Assembly adopt the Soviet Union's peace plan and the proposals made by the Soviet Union and other countries for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

The note pointed out that the United Nations General Assembly's discussion of the so-called "issue of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania's compliance with human rights and fundamental freedoms" is an intolerable interference in Romania's internal affairs and a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter. The note declared that the Romanian people demand that the United Nations stop US imperialism's attack on Romania's independence and sovereignty. The Romanian government announced that it would not recognize any decisions taken by the United Nations General Assembly on this proposal.

The note also declared that the Romanian people, along with all other peace-loving people, firmly demand that the United Nations General Assembly adopt the recommendations in the Soviet Union's "Declaration on Halting the Threat of a New War and Consolidating World Peace and Security"; and demand that the United Nations General Assembly accept the proposals made by the Soviet Union and other countries for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

Xinhua News Agency, 23rd dispatch: According to a TASS dispatch from Budapest citing the Hungarian News Agency, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Hungarian People's Republic, Mr. Károly Cyla, telegraphed the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Andesion, on the 19th, strongly protesting the United Nations General Assembly's illegal decision to discuss the US-UK group's slander of Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania regarding the so-called "violations of human rights," and firmly demanded that the case be removed from the agenda. The telegram pointed out that the United Nations General Assembly's discussion of this case is a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter. The arbitrary claims made by the US and UK governments that Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania have violated treaties are baseless slanders and are in reality an attempt to use the United Nations General Assembly as a tool to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs.

　　联大决定讨论美英诽谤保匈罗提案
    罗匈政府提出抗议
    一致指出这是明目张胆地违背联合国宪章
    【新华社十七日讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社讯：罗马尼亚人民共和国外交部长波克，代表罗马尼亚政府于十月十三日以照会一件致送联合国大会主席安迪让及联合国秘书长赖伊，严正抗议联合国大会非法决定讨论美英集团诽谤保、匈、罗三国所谓“侵犯人权”案，并坚决要求联合国大会通过苏联提出的和平方案及苏联等国所提和平解决朝鲜问题的提案。
    照会指出：联合国大会讨论所谓“保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚遵守人权及基本自由问题”案，乃是不可容忍地干涉罗马尼亚内政，和明目张胆地侵犯联合国宪章。照会宣称：罗马尼亚人民要求联合国制止美帝国主义这种对罗马尼亚独立及主权的攻击。罗马尼亚政府宣布将不承认联合国大会就此项提案所采取的任何决定。
    照会又宣称：罗马尼亚人民和所有其他爱好和平的人民一道，坚决要求联合国大会通过苏联所提“制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全宣言”中的各项建议；并要求联合国大会接受苏联等国提出的和平解决朝鲜问题提案。
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯电引匈牙利通讯社消息称：匈牙利人民共和国外交部部长卡莱·古拉于十九日致电联合国大会主席安迪让，严正抗议联合国大会非法决定讨论美英集团诽谤匈、保、罗三国所谓“侵犯人权”一案，并坚决要求将该案从议程中撤销。电文指出：联合国大会讨论此案乃是明目张胆地违背联合国宪章。美英两国政府所谓匈、保、罗违背和约的武断之词，是毫无根据的诽谤，实际上是想借此利用联合国大会作为干涉匈牙利内政的工具。
