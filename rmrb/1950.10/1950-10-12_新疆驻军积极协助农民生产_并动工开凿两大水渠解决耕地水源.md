Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 10th—A unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang has begun constructing two canals in Yanqi and Korla. The two canals are 131 kilometers long and are named the Nanda Canal and the Dadunzi Canal. A total of more than 6 million cubic meters of earth needs to be excavated. After the two canals are completed, they can irrigate 1.65 million mu to 1.7 million mu of land. The cultivated land in Yanqi, Korla, Yuli and other places will obtain abundant water sources due to the excavation of the two canals, and the hydropower generation of Tiemenguan can be doubled. The Dadunzi Canal started construction on the 15th of last month and strives to be completed by the end of July next year. The Nanda Canal is scheduled to start construction on October 10th and be completed within two and a half years. Commanders and fighters have shown their enthusiasm for actively building the motherland in the canal construction. Individual units have broken through the original plan of digging three cubic meters of earth per person per day, reaching an average of 8.28 cubic meters of earth per person per day. The commanders and fighters of the unit unanimously agreed to donate all of the two canals to the country after they are completed for the irrigation of local farmers.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 10th—In this year's large-scale production movement, the People's Liberation Army units stationed in southern Xinjiang helped poor farmers of all ethnic groups in the驻地 area cultivate more than 2,000 mu of land, adjusted more than 15,000 jin of seeds, irrigated 6,000 mu of land, and harvested more than 1,000 mu of wheat. During the water shortage period, many units allowed farmers of all ethnic groups to release water to irrigate cultivated land first. All units also assisted the local people's government and people of all ethnic groups in abolishing the water hegemony of successive water lords and reasonably using and distributing water conservancy. Farmers in Jiashi County were able to save 2,000 mu of autumn fields from drought as a result.
    
    People of all ethnic groups also have great trust in the驻军, and many farmers have requested the troops to help them resolve disputes. According to incomplete statistics, the驻军 in various places, based on the principle of national unity, have assisted the government in mediating more than 2,000 disputes between and within various ethnic groups, strengthening the unity between and within various ethnic groups. Uyghur farmers also actively helped and guided the troops in agricultural techniques such as land reclamation, irrigation, sowing, and cultivation. The 280,000 mu of land reclaimed by the Southern Xinjiang Garrison this year was successfully spring ploughed, summer hoeed, and autumn harvested with the help and guidance of Uyghur farmers.

　　新疆驻军积极协助农民生产
    并动工开凿两大水渠解决耕地水源
    【新华社西安十日电】驻新疆人民解放军某部已在焉耆、库尔勒两地动工开凿两条水渠。两渠共长一百三十一公里，定名为南大渠和大墩子渠，共需起土六百余万公方，两渠完成后可灌溉土地一百六十五万亩到一百七十万亩。焉耆、库尔勒、尉犁等地耕地将因两渠的开凿而获得丰富的水源，并可使铁门关的水力发电量增加一倍。大墩子渠已于上月十五日开工，争取于明年七月底竣工。南大渠定十月十日开工，两年半内完成。指战员们在修渠中表现了积极建设祖国的热诚。个别单位突破了原订每人每天挖土三公方的计划，达到每人每天平均挖土八点二八公方。该部指战员一致同意在两渠修竣后，全部捐献给国家，供当地农民灌溉之用。
    【新华社西安十日电】驻新疆南部的人民解放军各部在今年大生产运动中，曾帮助驻地各民族贫苦农民耕种土地二千余亩，调剂种籽一万五千余斤，浇地六千亩，割麦一千余亩。在缺水时期许多单位先让各民族农民放水灌溉耕地。各部并协助驻地人民政府和各民族人民，取消了历代水霸霸水的特权，合理地使用和分配水利。伽师县农民即因此使两千亩秋田免于旱死。
    各民族人民对驻军也极为信任，许多农民请求部队帮助他们解决纠纷。据不完全统计：各地驻军根据民族团结的原则，曾协助政府调解各民族间和各民族内部的纠纷达两千余件，加强了各民族间和各民族内部的团结。维吾尔族农民并在垦地、灌溉、播种、培育等农作技术上，积极帮助和指导部队。南疆驻军今年垦种的二十八万亩土地，即在维族农民的帮助指导下，顺利地进行了春耕、夏锄和秋收。
