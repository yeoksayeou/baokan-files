Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, October 23rd (TASS): Polish newspapers have published numerous commentaries regarding the declaration of the meeting of the foreign ministers of the eight countries: the Soviet Union, Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania. The Warsaw Newspaper, the official newspaper of the Polish government, stated: Polish public opinion believes that the Eight Foreign Ministers' declaration is a particularly important historical document, which makes a correct and realistic assessment of the danger of West German rearmament, and is a concrete plan for resolving the German question for world peace. The Prague declaration has specifically illustrated the dangers of the aggressive imperialist policies aimed at re-militarizing West Germany. It is not only welcomed by the citizens of the eight signatory countries, but also by millions of fighters for world peace and the working people of the world.
　　The Polish people warmly support the Prague declaration. The Polish people will fight alongside other peace-loving countries against the re-militarization of West Germany, and strive for peace and security for all countries.
