Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The China Zhi Gong Party issued a statement on the 11th opposing the US imperialists' expansion of the war of aggression against Korea. The full text is as follows:

On October 7, the United Nations General Assembly, manipulated by US imperialism, actually rejected the proposal by the Soviet Union and other five countries for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and absurdly and illegally passed the bloody proposal of the United Kingdom, Australia and other eight countries, authorizing the US imperialist and its accomplice countries' invading troops to invade and occupy the entire Korea, and further expand the war of aggression against Korea. Three months ago, the US imperialists illegally stole the name of the United Nations and launched a war of aggression against Korea, and now they are further stealing the name of the United Nations to expand the war of aggression against Korea!

Such a resolution is completely illegal and absurd, because it cannot represent the will of the majority of the world's population, and completely disregards the opinions of Asian countries. The bloody actions that closely follow this illegal resolution are resolutely opposed by all peace-loving people in the world, and are intolerable to all Asian people. We firmly advocate that "Asian affairs should be managed by the Asian people themselves!" What qualifications do US imperialism and all its accomplices have to intervene? The Korean issue can only be truly peaceful and reasonable if there is an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of all foreign troops in Korea, allowing all Korean people to freely elect to complete the unification and independence of Korea. At the same time, we solemnly warn the US imperialists and their accomplices that the Chinese people resolutely oppose the illegal resolution of the UN General Assembly on October 7 under the manipulation of US imperialism, and will resist any aggression to the end! As Premier Zhou said: "The Chinese people love peace, but in order to defend peace, they have never been and will never be afraid to resist wars of aggression."

[Report from this newspaper] Teachers and students of Peking University expressed their utmost indignation at the US imperialists' manipulation of the UN General Assembly and the illegal passage of the proposal of the United Kingdom, Australia, and other eight countries in order to fulfill the US imperialists' conspiracy to expand the war of aggression against Korea, and unanimously supported the statement of our Foreign Ministry spokesperson. Qian Duansheng, Dean of the Law School, pointed out that the US imperialists have been using various methods to undermine the principle of unanimity among the five major powers in the Security Council and the UN Charter in order to fulfill their conspiracy to launch a war of aggression, and said: "We must actively prepare our strength and not allow it to continue to expand the flames of war. The statement of the Foreign Ministry spokesperson has made it very clear that the US imperialists are manipulating the voting machine to pass illegal proposals. We Chinese people, Asian people, and the people of the world must unite and resolutely oppose the US imperialist war of aggression!" Professor Yang Hui of the Chinese Department said: "This kind of threat and provocation by the US imperialists is useless to the Chinese people and the Soviet people. On the one hand, we have the demand for peace, and on the other hand, we also have the determination and strength to defend peace." Zhang Jingyue, Dean of the Science Faculty, said: "Korea is only separated from our country by a river. Threatening the safety of the Korean people also threatens the safety of the Chinese people. We must strengthen our vigilance." Zhang Xin, a teaching assistant in the Law Department, said: "The proposal illegally passed by the US war merchants manipulating the United Nations agencies is the most intolerable and resolutely opposed by the people of the world, especially the Chinese people." Niu Guangye, a student in the Chinese Department, said: "The statement of our Foreign Ministry spokesperson is not only a warning to US imperialism, but also indicates that the Chinese people will join the people of the world in resolutely smashing the US imperialists' conspiracy to expand the war."

　　中国致公党发表声明
    反对美帝扩大侵朝战争
    北大师生坚决拥护外交部发言人声明
    【新华社十一日讯】中国致公党于十一日发表反对美帝国主义扩大侵朝战争声明，全文如下：
    十月七日，联合国大会在美帝国主义操纵下，居然否决了苏联等五国所提和平解决朝鲜问题的提案，荒谬而非法地通过了英、澳等八国所提的血腥提案，授权美帝国主义及其帮凶国家的侵朝军队侵略和占领整个朝鲜，并进一步扩大侵朝战争。三个月前，美帝国主义者曾非法地盗用了联合国的名义，发动了侵略朝鲜战争，现在又更进一步地盗用联合国之名，扩大侵朝战争了！
    这样的决议是完全非法而又荒谬的，因为它既不能代表全世界多数人口的意志，更完全不顾亚洲国家的意见，而这种非法决议所紧跟着的血腥举动，更是全世界爱好和平的人民所坚决反对的，也是全亚洲人民所不能容忍的。我们坚决主张“亚洲的事务应由亚洲人民自己来管！”美帝国主义及其一切帮凶有什么资格来过问？朝鲜问题只有立即停战，并撤退所有外国在朝军队，让全体朝鲜人民自由选举完成朝鲜的统一与独立，才是真正和平合理的。同时，我们要严正警告美帝国主义及其帮凶们，中国人民坚决反对美帝国主义操纵下十月七日的联大非法决议，并反抗任何侵略到底！诚如周总理所说：“中国人民热爱和平，但是为了保卫和平，从不也永不害怕反抗侵略战争。”
    【本报讯】北京大学师生对美帝操纵联大，非法通过英、澳等八国提案，以遂美帝扩大侵朝战争的阴谋，表示万分愤慨，一致拥护我外交部发言人的声明。法学院院长钱端升在指出美帝一直在用各种方法破坏安理会中五大国一致的原则和联合国宪章以遂其发动侵略战争的阴谋后，说：“我们要积极准备力量，不能让它继续扩大战争的火焰。外交部发言人的声明，已经把美帝操纵表决器通过非法提案的问题，说得很明白了。我们中国人民、亚洲人民和全世界人民，要团结起来，坚决反对美帝的侵略战争！”中文系杨晦教授说：“美帝这种威胁与挑衅行为，对中国人民和苏联人民说来都是不中用的。一方面我们有和平的要求，另一方面我们也有保卫和平的决心和力量。”理学院张景钺院长说：“朝鲜与我国仅一江之隔，威胁了朝鲜人民的安全，也就是威胁了中国人民的安全。我们要加强警惕。”法律系助教张鑫说：“美国战争贩子操纵联合国机构非法通过的提案，是全世界人民尤其是中国人民所最不能忍受、最坚决反对的。”中文系牛广业同学说：“我外交部发言人的声明，不仅是对美帝的一种警告，而且表示中国人民将和全世界人民一道，坚决粉碎美帝扩大战争的阴谋。”    （北大通讯组）
