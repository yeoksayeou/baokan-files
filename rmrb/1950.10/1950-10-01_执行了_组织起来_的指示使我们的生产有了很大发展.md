　　Implementing the "Get Organized" Instruction Has Greatly Developed Our Production
    Agricultural Model of North China Region  Li Shunda
    Under the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have been liberated and stood up. In the past few years of production campaigns, Chairman Mao called on us to organize ourselves for production. As a result, our production has greatly developed, we have harvested more grain, and our lives have become better.
    However, American imperialism is constantly plotting to launch wars, destroy world peace, and undermine our production. We peace-loving people must take practical actions to defend world peace and oppose the aggressive schemes of American imperialism. In agricultural production, we must further organize the broad masses of working people, help each other in production, continue to improve technology, and harvest more grain to support the People's Liberation Army and defend national defense. We must grow more cash crops to supply industrial raw materials and develop industry. We must do a good job in mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, so that industry can powerfully support agricultural production. Workers, peasants, and all working people must unite more closely, launch a large-scale production movement, and strive to build a new China.

　　执行了“组织起来”的指示使我们的生产有了很大发展
    华北区农业模范  李顺达
    中国人民在共产党毛主席的领导下，得到了解放，翻了身。在以往的几年生产运动中，毛主席号召我们组织起来进行生产，因此我们的生产有了很大的发展，多打了粮食，生活过得更好了。
    可是美帝国主义时刻在阴谋发动战争，破坏世界和平，破坏我们的生产。我们爱好和平的人民一定要以实际行动保卫世界和平，反对美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。在农业生产中我们更要把广大劳动群众组织起来，互助生产，继续提高技术，多打粮食，支援人民解放军，保卫国防。我们要多种经济作物，供应工业原料，发展工业，做好城乡互助，使工业有力的扶助农业生产。工人、农民及一切劳动人民，要更加亲密地团结起来，开展大生产运动，为建设新中国而奋斗。
