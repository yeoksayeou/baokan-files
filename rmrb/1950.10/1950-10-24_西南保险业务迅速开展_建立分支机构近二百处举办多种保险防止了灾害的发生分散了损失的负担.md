　　Southwest Insurance Business Rapidly Developing
　　Establishing nearly two hundred branch offices, launching various insurance types to prevent disasters, dispersing the burden of losses
　　[Our Newspaper’s Dispatch] The business of the Southwest District State-Owned People's Insurance Company of China is gradually developing.

　　After the establishment of the Southwest District Company of the People's Insurance Company of China in January of this year, it successively established branch companies, offices, and local agencies in large and medium-sized cities throughout the region, totaling more than one hundred and ninety, and launched various businesses such as fire insurance, transportation insurance, passenger accident insurance for ships, and cattle insurance. In the past few months, People's Insurance Companies at all levels have conducted extensive publicity work, explaining the nature of the People's Insurance cause, and correcting the idea in public and private enterprises that insurance is superfluous. Local governments have also stipulated that all state-owned enterprises must take out insurance, and the insurance companies have simplified insurance procedures in their business and quickly compensated policyholders for their losses, thus enabling the rapid development of the business.

　　The development of insurance business has dispersed the burden of losses and prevented the occurrence of disasters. Insurance companies have set up more than forty inspection stations and beach affairs stations at wharves and beaches in riverside cities to handle inspections and guide ships to safely navigate shallow waters and dangerous shoals, reducing losses caused by overloading or rapid currents. In cities, insurance companies have conducted fire prevention publicity and inspection work, and assisted policyholders in adding fire-fighting equipment to important buildings and warehouses. As a result, none of the households that have insured fire insurance in the past eight months have suffered fire disasters. The cattle insurance carried out to develop agricultural production has also achieved certain results in reducing cattle deaths. For example, in the Beibei District of Chongqing, among more than one thousand cattle insured, the mortality rate of cattle was reduced from 4% to 0.1% due to the insurance company's free epidemic prevention injections and treatment. In addition, in order to compensate passengers on ships for losses caused by accidental injuries during their journeys, the Southwest District Company, with the approval of the first Chongqing Municipal People's Representative Conference and the Southwest Financial and Economic Committee, has comprehensively launched compulsory passenger accident insurance for ships on all long and short routes in the Southwest District since August 10.

　　西南保险业务迅速开展
    建立分支机构近二百处举办多种保险防止了灾害的发生分散了损失的负担
    【本报讯】西南区国营中国人民保险公司业务正逐步发展中。
    中国人民保险公司西南区公司在今年一月成立后，即相继在全区大中城市建立分支公司、办事处及各地代理处共一百九十余处，开展了火险、运输险、轮船乘客意外伤害险、耕牛险等多种业务。各级人民保险公司几个月来曾广泛进行宣传工作，说明人民保险事业的性质，纠正公私企业中认投保为多余的思想。各地政府也都规定公营企业必须一律投保，加以保险公司在业务上简化投保手续，迅速赔偿保户的损失，因而使业务有了迅速的开展。
    保险业务的开展，分散了损失的负担，防止了灾害的发生。保险公司在沿河城市的码头、滩口设立查验站、滩务站四十余处，办理查验和指导往来船只放滩过险的工作，减少了船只因载量过重或滩险流急所造成的损失。在城市中，保险公司进行了防火宣传和检查工作，并协助保户在重要建筑物及仓库添置防火设备，因此八个月来保了火险的各户没有一家遭受火灾。为发展农业生产所进行的耕牛保险，在减少耕牛死亡上也收到一定效果。如重庆北碚区承保耕牛一千余头中，由于保险公司免费进行防疫注射和治疗，耕牛死亡率由百分之四减低为百分之零点一。此外，西南区公司为补偿轮船乘客在旅程中所遭受意外伤害的损失，经过重庆市第一届各界人民代表会议通过和西南财政经济委员会的核准，已自八月十日起，在西南区各长短航线间全面试办了强制性的轮船乘客意外伤害保险。
