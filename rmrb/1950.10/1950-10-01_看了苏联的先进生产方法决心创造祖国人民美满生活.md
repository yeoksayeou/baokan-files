　　Determined to Create a Happy Life for the People of the Motherland After Seeing the Advanced Production Methods of the Soviet Union
　　Northeast Industrial Labor Model Zhao Guoyou
　　The first National Day of the People's Republic of China has arrived, and I am extremely happy! Looking back on the vigorous development of our industrial construction in Northeast China over the past year, our workers have also enjoyed a happy life with the development of production, shedding our slave status and becoming the masters of the new China. In the past, countless working people were "blind" for decades without being able to read, but today, under the cultivation and education of the Party and the government, many of us can read newspapers, and some can even write. Now that the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China has arrived, I feel truly ashamed when I think about the past. A year and a half ago, I was still half blind and full of muddled ideas. I remember very clearly that when Shenyang was liberated in the winter of 1948, I still did not trust my government and the Party. At the beginning of the liberation, the Party told us very clearly, "Today the workers are the masters of the country," but we were confused at the time, "What masters? Workers have been slaves since ancient times. No matter who comes, it's just changing the soup but not the medicine, just changing a dynasty. When the Kuomintang first came, they also said they would talk about democracy, but as a result, our workers were ruined and their families destroyed. Anyway, it's just working, earning money, and eating. The work is still the same old way, dawdling and loafing."

　　A month after the liberation, the Party transferred me to the staff training class of the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. After 45 days of studying the history of social development, the history of the Party, etc., my muddled brain turned around. I realized that the Communist Party is our own Party, and the People's Government is our own government, which truly serves the working masses. At the same time, I realized that workers are the masters of the country. However, I was not able to get rid of all the problems that the old society had given me at once. After returning to the factory, I only knew how to bury myself in hard work, and I did not know how to unite my brothers to advance together. It was very obvious when creating new records. At that time, I was very isolated; but the situation was so urgent and serious, I relied on the Party to get it properly resolved. The Party constantly educated me, saying: "It is right for you to bury yourself in hard work. In addition, you must also humbly learn from veteran workers and technicians, improve your cultural, political, and technical level, and help other workers." At the same time, the Party gave me an example, saying: "For example, the locomotive runs very fast, but as a result, it forgets the train cars. It is useless to run so fast. It is also faster to hook more cars and load more goods. Only in this way can the locomotive play its role!" After that, I ran along this bright road. Everyone saw me taking this road and approached me, and gradually my relationship with comrades became closer. When other people's work improved, my own work also greatly improved. When the new record craze started last year, in September, I reduced the new two-hour and twenty-minute turret record to one hour and sixteen minutes. At this time, I thought that if I had not been cultivated and educated by the Party, so that I could unite the masses, I would not have achieved any work results. It is like a fish leaving the water. After I realized this truth, I worked even harder to strive to join the ranks of the Party. After three or four requests, I became a glorious Communist Party member on November 15, 1949. Under the cultivation and education of the Party, my culture, politics, and technology gradually improved, and I was often able to write articles in newspapers. Last December, I shortened the new one-hour and sixteen-minute turret record to fifty minutes. But the tail (that is, the problem) left to me by the old society has not been completely removed. I believe that under the leadership and education of our Party and government, the remaining tail will be cut off quickly.

　　Not long ago, under the cultivation of the Party, I got a very valuable opportunity to visit Moscow and Leningrad in the Soviet Union, which made me deeply realize that only with the leadership of the All-Union Communist Party can the Soviet Union have such great construction and the working people can enjoy a happy life.

　　All production processes in the Soviet Union are mechanized. Let me give two factories as examples: In the Moscow bread factory, there are more than 700 people in the whole factory, and they produce 200 tons of bread every day, which can supply 500,000 people. Let's calculate it. How much labor can be saved? At least 500,000 women are liberated from turning around the stove! Why does it have such a result? It is because its production process is completely mechanized. The production process is very simple. There is only one building with four workshops. In the workshop downstairs, there are only two female workers who pour the flour into the machine, and then it comes down from upstairs, and the hot bread comes out. The Leningrad shoe factory is even more amazing. It has been insisting on production during the war. Leningrad was surrounded by German fascist bandits for 900 days, and more than one million shells and bombs fell on the city, suffering the most brutal destruction. This shoe factory was only 15 kilometers away from the front line. Every factory building was hit by shells and bombs. There were more than 20 incendiary bombs alone. None of the factory buildings was complete. Before the war, there were more than 11,000 workers there. During the war, only 200 workers remained and insisted on working. They never stopped for a day. The workers only ate half a catty of bread a day. In emergency situations, they could not eat for several days. In this way, they still vigorously carried out socialist production competitions and won two award flags. The factory director specially showed us the photos of the destruction at that time and the two award flags. Now, not only have they all recovered, but also many new workshops have been added, and the daily output has reached 50,000 pairs of shoes. Each person produces an average of 12 pairs of shoes a day. Its production process, from upstairs to downstairs, from this end of the workshop to that end of the workshop, is completely mechanized, and each working procedure does not require manual transmission. For example, after the shoe upper is sewn, it is placed on the belt, and when it reaches the place where the shoe eye is punched, it is picked up and touched on the machine, and all the shoe eyes are punched. After several procedures, the finished product comes out before your eyes.

　　When I first arrived in Moscow, I was very strange. Why couldn't I see a worker? There were very few people during the day. In the evening, the streets were like small parades. People were wearing beautiful suits, especially the female workers, who had curled hair, high heels, and rosy faces. A pair of men and women were playing around arm in arm. Later, I asked Lao Chen, who had gone to the Soviet Union earlier: "Why can't I see a worker?" He pointed to me and said that the people playing on the street in very beautiful clothes are male and female workers, and there are many cars on the street, many of which are owned by the workers themselves. I also saw how Soviet laborers used their spare time to improve their cultural, political, and technical levels. In the Leningrad Cultural Palace, I saw their poetry group, drama group, music group, sports group, dance group, club, cinema, library, etc. There were more than 20,000 books in this Cultural Palace. The reading room was very large, but the room was crowded with people, and even the corridors were full of people reading books. 20,000 books were often not enough, and most workers borrowed them to take home to read. Not only here, but there are similar libraries and various schools everywhere to facilitate laborers to improve their cultural, political, and technical levels.

　　The All-Union Communist Party and the Soviet government are truly meticulous in their care for the laborers. The medical clinics in the factories we saw were so well-equipped that they deserved to be called hospitals. In terms of labor protection, the All-Union Communist Party and the government have specially established a Labor Protection Research Institute to study all labor protection issues in factories. We visited the Leningrad Labor Protection Research Institute, where 150 experts are concentrated to study various safety equipment.

　　In the first five-year plan after the war, the All-Union Communist Party and the government allocated 5 billion rubles for labor protection funds. In the past ten years or so, more than 1,000 labor protection methods have been devised, greatly reducing the injury rate of factory workers. Some cities have completely eliminated injuries, and diseases will soon be completely eliminated. There are eleven laboratories working here, which are: (1) Technical Safety Room, (2) Electrical Safety Room, (3) Production Hygiene, (4) Protection Room, (5) Elimination of Sound Room, (6) Physical and Chemical Room, (7) Ventilation Equipment Room, (8) Conditioning Cold and Heat Climate Room, (9) Dust Test Room, (10) Lighting Room, (11) Technical Assistance Room. There are many other conditions for a happy life in other aspects. Here are just a few examples.

　　These are the happy lives created by the Soviet people under the leadership of the All-Union Communist Party after hard work. Today, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people are learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and they will surely create such a happy life. Therefore, when I saw the lives of the Soviet people, I also saw the prospects for the lives of the Chinese people.

　　Finally, what workers in the past could not even dream of is that, under the cultivation of our Party and with the support of our comrades, I attended the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as a nonvoting delegate. What made me most happy during the meeting, and what made all the workers most happy, was that I met Chairman Mao the day before the meeting! When Chairman Mao shook my hand tightly, I felt unspeakably happy. At the same time, seeing Chairman Mao's humble and simple style, his concern and love for our workers' work, study, and life, made me eager to tell all my worker brothers about these situations at that time. During the nine-day meeting, we summarized the experience of the previous period and decided on various policies. The meeting unanimously approved the work report of the National Committee and the various reports of the Central People's Government. In order to make our six worker and peasant representatives learn these reports more deeply and be able to put forward opinions on managing the country, the State Council specially sent two comrades to help us study and record; and liaison officers constantly came to our hotel to ask questions and care about our study and life. On the day of the closing ceremony, Chairman Mao took pictures with us several worker and peasant representatives, personally signed our names, and toasted us at the banquet, while telling us that the working class should unite!

　　Just as our heroic People's Liberation Army defeated the American imperialist running dog Kuomintang reactionaries, and only Taiwan and Tibet were not liberated in the whole country, the shameless American imperialism openly invaded our territory in the East - Taiwan, armedly invaded Korea, and recently provoked in the northeast airspace, strafing our worker brothers. These provocations and brutal crimes prove that American imperialism is trying to expand its war of aggression and is trying to trample on the people of the Far East and the people of the world. This crime is intolerable to the Chinese people and the people of the world. I firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn protest and accusation with practical actions; I guarantee to work with my workmates on the brand-new and shiny lathes made by ourselves and shipped from the Soviet Union, with unparalleled enthusiasm to further learn from the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang Group, create model workshops, oppose the aggression of American imperialism, and never allow it to go crazy in front of us.

　　看了苏联的先进生产方法决心创造祖国人民美满生活
    东北工业劳动模范  赵国有
    中华人民共和国第一个国庆日到啦，我高兴极啦！回想一年来我们东北的工业建设得到了蓬勃的发展，我们工人也是随着生产的发展得到幸福的生活，脱去奴隶地位，变成新中国的主人翁。过去，无数劳动人民当了数十年的“白眼瞎子”不识字，在党和政府培养教育下，今天有很多人已能看报纸，有的还能写作了。现在中华人民共和国第一个诞生纪念日到了，我想起过去真真惭愧。在一年半以前我还是半个白眼瞎子和满脑子糊涂思想。我记得还很清楚，一九四八年冬沈阳解放，在那时对自己的政府和党还不相信。解放开始，党就告诉我们很清楚，“今天工人是国家主人翁”，但是我们当时很糊涂，“什么主人不主人的，工人自古以来就是当奴隶，不论谁来，都是换汤不换药，改换一个朝代而已。国民党刚来的时候也是说要讲民主，结果害我们工人家破人亡。反正是干活、挣钱、吃饭，工作还是老一套、磨洋工、泡磨菇。”
    解放一个月后，党调我到沈阳市总工会职工训练班学习，经过四十五天学习社会发展史、党史等，才把糊涂脑瓜转过来。认清了共产党是我们自己的党，人民政府是我们自己的政府，是真正为了劳苦大众服务的。同时也认识了工人是国家主人翁。但是，我没有能把旧社会所给我的毛病都一齐去掉，回到工厂后光知道埋头苦干，不知道如何团结自己弟兄一齐前进。创造新纪录时就很明显，当时自己非常孤立；可是那时情况是那样紧急严重，我依靠了党，才得到适当的解决了。党不断的教育我说：“你埋头苦干是对的，另外你还得虚心向老工人和技术人员学习、提高文化、政治、技术水平，帮助其他工人。”同时党给我举了个例子说：“比方火车头跑的非常快，结果忘掉车皮啦，就这样跑的再快也没用；多挂车皮多装货跑的也快，这样才能起火车头的作用呢！”以后，我依着这条光明的大道就跑去啦，大家看我走这条路也就接近我，渐渐和同志们的关系也密切起来。别人工作提高了，我自己的工作也大大的进步。去年新纪录热潮起来，在九月份，我把二小时二十分塔轮新纪录降低到了一小时十六分钟，这时我就想，我要没有党的培养教育，使我能够团结群众，是不会得到任何工作成绩的，这就像鱼离开水一样。我认识了这个道理以后，便更努力工作，争取参加到党的队伍里来。经过三、四次的要求，结果在一九四九年十一月十五日，我成为光荣的共产党员了。在党的培养教育下，使我文化政治技术渐渐进步，经常能够在报纸上写稿子。去年十二月份，又把一小时十六分钟塔轮新纪录缩短到五十分钟。但旧社会留给我的尾巴（就是毛病）还没能全部去掉，我相信在我们的党及政府的领导与教育下，会把我剩下的尾巴很快的割掉的。
    不久以前，我在党的培养之下得到一个很宝贵的机会，曾到苏联莫斯科、列宁格勒去参观，这使我深深认识到：只有联共党的领导，苏联才能有那样伟大的建设，劳动人民才能得到美满的生活。
    苏联的一切生产过程，都是机械化的。举两个工厂作例子：在莫斯科面包工厂，全厂人员共七百多人，每天生产面包二百吨，可以供给五十万人吃。我们给它计算一下，可以节省多少劳动力，至少也解放了五十万妇女围着锅台转吧！它为什么有这样结果呢？就是因为它的生产过程完全机械化了，生产过程很简单，那里只是一个大楼，分四个车间，楼下这个车间就只有两个女工把面倒进机器里去，再从楼上下来，就是热面包出来啦。列宁格勒的皮鞋工厂更惊人，它在战争中一直坚持生产。列宁格勒是被德国法西斯匪徒包围了九百天，全城落了一百多万发炮弹和炸弹，遭受到最残酷破坏的。这个皮鞋工厂只离战线十五公里，每个场房都落了炮弹和炸弹，单中了起火的炸弹的就有二十多处，场房没有一个完整的，在战前那里有一万一千多工人，战争时只剩下二百工人还坚持工作，一天也没停过，工人每天只吃半斤面包，情况紧急时几天吃不到饭，就这样还轰轰烈烈搞社会主义生产竞赛，获得两面奖旗。厂长特别给我们看了被破坏当时的照片和两面奖旗。现在不但都已恢复起来，而且添设了很多新式车间，每天生产量达到五万双皮鞋。每人平均一天出产十二双皮鞋。它的生产过程，由楼上到楼下，从车间这头到车间那头，完全是机械化，每道工作手续，都不用人工传送。比如：鞋帮缝纫完了就放在轮带上，到打鞋眼那地方拿起来就往机械上一碰，鞋眼全打成啦，再经过几道手续，眼看着成品就出来啦。
    我初到莫斯科，很奇怪，为什么看不见一个工人呢？白天人很少，一到晚间，街上就像小游行一样，人们都穿着漂亮的西装，尤其是女工，都烫的卷发穿着高跟鞋，脸上粉红、离很远就香鼻子，一对一对的男女，挎着胳膊游玩。后来我问早去苏联的老陈：“怎么看不见一个工人呢？”他就指给我看那满街上穿着很漂亮的游玩的人就是男女工人，满街汽车，很多是工人自己的。我又看到了苏联劳动者们怎样利用业余时间来提高自己文化、政治技术水平。在列宁格勒文化宫里面，见到了他们的诗歌组、戏剧组、音乐组、体育组、跳舞组、俱乐部、电影院、图书馆等，这文化宫里面有图书二万多册，阅览室地方非常大，可是屋里人挤满啦，连走廊都坐着人看书，二万册时常不够用，多数工人借回家去看。不但这里，到处都是同样的图书馆及各种各样学校，以便利劳动者们提高自己的文化、政治技术水平。
    联共党和苏维埃政府对劳动者们的关怀真是无微不至的，我们所见到工厂中的医务所其设备之完善，说它是医院也当之无愧。劳动保护方面，联共党和政府专门设立了劳动保护研究院，研究工厂中一切劳保问题。我们参观列宁格勒的劳动保护研究院，这里面集中一百五十名专家，专门研究各种安全设备。
    在战后第一个五年计划中，联共党和政府就拨了劳动保护经费五十亿卢布。最近十几年来，已经想出劳动保护办法一千多种，工厂工人受伤率大大减少，有些城市已经完全没有受伤的，不久可以把病害等全部消灭。那里有十一个实验室进行工作，这十一个实验室是：（１）技术安全室，（２）电力安全室，（３）生产卫生，（４）防护室，（５）消灭生音室，（６）物理化学室，（７）通风设备室，（８）调和寒热气候室，（９）灰尘试验室，（１０）照明室，（１１）技术帮助室。其他各方面美满生活的条件还多的很，这里只举几个例子。
    这些都是苏联人民在联共党的领导下，经过艰难创造出来的美满生活。今天中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，学习苏联的先进经验，也一定会创造出来这样幸福的生活，所以我看到了苏联的人民生活，也就看到了中国人民生活的远景。
    最后，更是我们工人过去连作梦也想不到的事情，在我们党的培养下和同志们拥护之下，我列席了中国人民政协全国委员会第二次会议。在会议当中，使我最高兴的，也就是所有工人最高兴的，会前一天我见到毛主席啦！当毛主席和我紧紧握手的时候，我心里说不出来的高兴。同时，见到毛主席那样谦虚朴素的作风，那样关心和热爱我们工人的工作、学习、生活，急得我恨不当时把这些情形叫所有工人弟兄们都知道。九天会议当中，总结了前一时期的经验，决定了各项方针。会议上一致同意了全国委员会的会务报告和中央人民政府各项报告。政务院为了使我们六个工农代表对这些报告学习更深刻，能提出管理国家的意见，专门派了两位同志帮助我们学习和记录；并且不断的有联络员来我们住的旅馆问长问短，很关心我们的学习和生活等。在闭幕的那一天，毛主席和我们几个工农代表在一起照像，亲笔给我们签字，宴会上又和我们碰杯，同时告诉我们工人阶级团结起来！
    正在我们英勇的人民解放军打败了美帝走狗国民党反动派、全国仅剩台湾、西藏没有解放的时候，无耻的美帝国主义又在东方公然侵略我国领土——台湾，武装侵略朝鲜，最近又在东北上空挑衅，扫射我们工人弟兄，这些挑衅和残暴罪恶行为，都证明了美帝国主义正在企图扩大侵略战争，正在企图蹂躏远东人民和世界人民，这种罪行是中国人民和世界人民所不能容忍的，我坚决用实际行动来拥护周外长的严正抗议和控诉；我保证和工友们在亲手作出来的和由苏联运来的崭新雪亮的车床上，以无比的热情更进一步学习马恒昌小组先进经验，创造模范车间，反对美帝的侵略，决不允许它在我们面前发狂。
