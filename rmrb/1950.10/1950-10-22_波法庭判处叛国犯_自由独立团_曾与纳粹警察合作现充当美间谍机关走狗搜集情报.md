　　Polish Court Sentences Traitors
    “Freedom and Independence Group” Collaborated with Nazi Police and Now Acts as a Lackey of the American Espionage Agency, Collecting Intelligence
    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch] TASS, Warsaw, 15th -- The Warsaw Regional Military Court sentenced the main criminals of the headquarters of the fascist spy organization "Freedom and Independence Group" on the 14th. The defendants Cieplinski, Lazarowicz, Hempel, Bralce, Kowalec, Siepka, and Bator were sentenced to death. The defendant Kubik was sentenced to life imprisonment, Tzielinska was sentenced to 15 years in prison, and Michalowska was sentenced to 12 years in prison.
    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch] TASS, Warsaw, 13th -- When the Warsaw Regional Military Court continued the trial of the main criminals of the headquarters of the Polish fascist organization "Freedom and Independence Group" on the 11th, Prosecutor General Trammer gave a speech stating that the defendants had maintained direct contact with institutions that oppressed the people before the war. The Prosecutor General also listed conclusive facts, exposing the activities of the defendants during the occupation of Poland and the rebellious role played by the "Krajowa Army." The "Krajowa Army" headquarters instructed its soldiers not to fight the German invaders in order to supposedly "save blood," but instead drove its troops to attack the Soviet army. During the trial, the order from the "Krajowa Army" headquarters prohibiting its soldiers from assisting the Soviet landing forces was presented in court. The prosecutor cited examples of the "Krajowa Army" under the command of the defendant Cieplinski murdering Soviet soldiers who had escaped from captivity by the Hitler bandit gang.
    The prosecutor stated that the defendants were afraid of the Soviet army because they knew that the Soviet army was bringing true freedom to Poland; they were afraid that the liberated masses would surely settle accounts with them for the crimes they had committed.
    The prosecutor pointed out that the defendants did not reform themselves during the amnesty, but continued their lurking activities that endangered the people.
    After cooperating with the German Nazi secret police, the defendants, together with the Polish reactionaries, were driven by British and American imperialism and became their bought-off spies.
    The organization of the "Freedom and Independence Group," under the leadership of Cieplinski and other defendants, followed the instructions of their American masters. The defendants engaged in espionage, terrorist activities, subversive activities, and hostile propaganda. The illegal "Freedom and Independence Group" organization did things that Mikolajczyk's legal party at the time could not do. The prosecutor exposed the collusion between the "Freedom and Independence Group" and reactionary Catholic clergy, pointing out that the "Freedom and Independence Group" supplied espionage intelligence to Bishop Wronka of the Gdansk diocese, priest Piwowarczyk of the Krakow diocese, and the office of Cardinal Hlond through priest Przysztorski.
    The prosecutor detailed the meetings between Cieplinski and other defendants and representatives of the American intelligence agencies, Colonel Washley and Colonel Jessey, emphasizing that war was the topic of their conversation. Jessey was mainly interested in military intelligence and intelligence related to the Soviet Union and the Soviet army. The defendants were rewarded by their American masters for engaging in espionage activities.
    The prosecutor demanded that the American imperialist agents—Cieplinski, Lazarowicz, Hempel, Bralce, Kowalec, Kubik, Siepka, and Bator—be sentenced to death, that the defendant Tzielinska be sentenced to life imprisonment, and that the defendant Michalowska be sentenced to a long term of imprisonment.
    The defendants' lawyers then made their defense, and each defendant made a final statement.
    The verdict in this case will be announced on the 14th.

　　波法庭判处叛国犯
    “自由独立团”曾与纳粹警察合作现充当美间谍机关走狗搜集情报
    【新华社讯】塔斯社华沙十五日电：华沙地方军事法庭于十四日已将法西斯间谍组织“自由独立团”总部首要罪犯宣判。被告捷普林斯基、拉查罗维兹、赫美尔、布拉尔塞伊、科瓦列茨、塞普卡和巴托雷，被判处死刑。被告库比克被判处无期徒刑，捷尔尼斯卡被判处十五年徒刑，米哈洛夫斯卡被判处十二年徒刑。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社华沙十三日电：华沙地方军事法庭于十一日继续审讯波兰法西斯组织“自由独立团”总部要犯一案时，总检察官特拉美尔发表演说称：被告等过去曾与战前压迫人民的机构保持直接联系。总检察官并列举确凿的事实，揭发各被告在波兰被占领期间所进行的活动，以及“克拉约瓦军”所起的叛逆的作用。“克拉约瓦军”司令部曾训令士兵们为了所谓“血的节约”切勿对德寇作战，而驱使它的部队去袭击苏军。在审讯时曾当庭呈阅“克拉约瓦军”司令部禁止该部士兵协助苏军登陆部队的命令。检察官举例说明被告捷普林斯基指挥下的“克拉约瓦军”曾杀害从希特勒匪党囚禁中逃出来的苏军士兵。
    检察官称：被告等害怕苏军，因为他们知道苏军正以真正的自由带给波兰；他们害怕获得解放的群众一定要向他们清算他们所犯的罪行。
    检察官指出：被告等不曾在大赦时自新，却依然继续危害人民的潜伏活动。
    被告等在与德国纳粹秘密警察合作后，与波兰反动派一同供英美帝国主义驱使，成为被他们收买的特务了。
    “自由独立团”的组织，在捷普林斯基及其他被告的领导之下，奉行着美国主子们的指令。被告等曾进行了间谍工作、恐怖活动和颠覆性活动，以及敌意的宣传。非法的“自由独立团”组织，干着当时米柯拉兹科的合法政党所不能干的勾当。检察官揭发“自由独立团”与反动的天主教教士方面的勾结，他指出：“自由独立团”经由教士普尔什托斯基，以间谍情报供给格丹斯克教区的主教夫隆卡，克拉科教区教士皮伏瓦尔什克及红衣主教赫伦德的办事处。
    检察官详细揭发捷普林斯基及其他被告与美国谍报机关的代表们瓦什莱上校及杰赛上校开会情形，他强调指出：战争是他们谈话的主题。杰赛感到兴趣的，主要是军事情报，以及与苏联和苏军有关的情报。被告等因为从事间谍活动曾受到其美国主子的酬劳。
    检察官要求将美国帝国主义的特务分子——捷普林斯基、拉查罗维兹、赫美尔、布拉塞、科瓦列茨、库比克、塞普卡和巴托雷判处死刑，将被告捷尔尼斯卡判处无期徒刑，将被告米哈洛夫斯卡判处长期徒刑。
    继由被告律师辩护，并由各被告作最后申诉。
    本案将于十四日宣判。
