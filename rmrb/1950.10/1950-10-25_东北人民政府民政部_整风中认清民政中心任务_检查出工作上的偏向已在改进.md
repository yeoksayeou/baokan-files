　　Northeast People's Government Ministry of Civil Affairs
    Recognizing the Central Task of Civil Affairs During Rectification; Checking and Improving Work Deviations
    [This newspaper reports] According to the Northeast Daily: The two-and-a-half-month rectification study of the Ministry of Civil Affairs of the Northeast People's Government concluded in late September. Through this rectification, the ministry clarified that its central tasks are: (1) Leading the work of people's representative conferences at all levels; (2) Understanding, training, and educating cadres; and (3) Social relief work. During the rectification, these three central tasks were examined, major problems were identified, and preliminary improvement measures were proposed.

    The examination first revealed a tendency towards formalism in the work of the People's Representative Conference. This was mainly reflected in: (1) Leading cadres of the ministry often treated this central task on par with other tasks in their actual work. Their leadership of the People's Representative Conferences at all levels was limited to collecting materials. In half a year, more than ten cadres of the ministry went to the countryside more than ten times to assist the work of the People's Representative Conference, encountered some problems, but did not seriously study and discuss them after returning, and therefore did not propose solutions. (2) Poor policy views. First, there was insufficient understanding of the implementation of the united front policy, and there was a formalistic thinking that started from the task, or simply circled around meeting techniques. Secondly, there was little research on whether the People's Representative Conference had played its due role. Because the leading cadres themselves had a formalistic guiding ideology towards the People's Representative Conference, the formalistic tendencies of the People's Representative Conference could not be corrected. (3) The content and methods of the People's Representative Conference were old-fashioned, and few new experiences were proposed. For example, the activities of the provincial and municipal consultation committees and the county standing committees have not been studied, so they have not played a guiding role. The basic reason for this problem is that the leadership style is bureaucratic, busy with daily chores, and thus neglects the systematic study of the policies and specific methods of the People's Representative Conference, which naturally leads to a generalized and vague leadership from top to bottom. In this way, it is naturally difficult for the People's Representative Conference to truly play its due role. The rectification clearly recognized that to truly hold the People's Representative Conference well, it is necessary to correct the formalistic tendencies in the guiding ideology and in the conference itself, to seize the key points for research at any time, and to provide guidance at any time; leading cadres must personally do a good job of several typical examples and learn from experience; and to establish an in-depth inspection system.

    Secondly, in cadre work, the main problem identified was that there was insufficient in-depth understanding of the situation of cadres. Cadres at the lower levels had a commandist style of work, but the leadership did not understand the actual situation, and therefore could not propose appropriate solutions in a timely manner. The ministry's cadre work was limited to general appointment and removal procedures and statistics, and it rarely knew what they needed and could not carry out effective regular education and timely centralized training. Work plans have also become formalities, such as requiring that in the first half of the year, "the cadre work of each province and city should be established..." But there was no follow-up on how to establish it; and another example, "solve the problem of working methods of district and village cadres in the first half of the year," but there were no specifics on how to solve it. Based on the above situation, the rectification proposed that in the future, a system for training and education of cadres should be established first, education methods should be improved, and the policy and cultural level of cadres should be improved; and cadres should be educated and their work style should be changed through the People's Representative Conference. In order to grasp the situation of cadres, it is necessary to do a good job in investigation and research, seize typical examples, and organize research on specific issues. The ministry has selected training classes set up by cadre schools in two provinces for inspection to help correct the tendency of teaching to be divorced from reality.

    Thirdly, the main problem in disaster relief work is that the leadership is not proactive enough and does not treat disaster prevention and relief as a regular task. For example, the ministry lacked a realistic assessment of the disaster situation in Rehe, and did not give the lower levels instructions on the main methods of disaster relief. The rectification analyzed this situation, making the leadership clear that disaster relief work must be forward-looking, timely organize forces to go deep into the disaster areas for on-the-spot investigation, and earnestly organize production for self-relief. After discovering this problem in the rectification, the ministry immediately organized forces to go to Rehe to check the situation of disaster victims spending the winter, and promoted all parties to assist in solving the problem of cotton clothing for disaster victims.

    In the middle of the rectification, the ministry's departments and sections mastered the method of rectifying and reforming as they went, and made necessary adjustments in organizational structure, division of labor, and procedural systems, so the current work efficiency and work order have been greatly improved and enhanced.

### 东北人民政府民政部  整风中认清民政中心任务  检查出工作上的偏向已在改进

　　东北人民政府民政部
    整风中认清民政中心任务
    检查出工作上的偏向已在改进
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：东北人民政府民政部历时两个半月的整风学习，已于九月下旬结束。该部经过此次整风，明确了部的中心任务是：（一）领导各级人民代表会工作；（二）对干部的了解、训练教育工作；（三）社会救济工作。整风中对这三个中心工作进行了检查，发现了主要问题，并提出了初步改进办法。
    检查中首先检查出人民代表会议工作存在着形式主义的偏向。主要表现在：（一）该部领导干部在实际工作中，往往把这件中心工作与其他工作平列看待。对各级人民代表会议的领导只停留于汇集材料。该部半年中，有十余个干部下乡帮助人民代表会工作十余次，遇到了一些问题，但回来后没有认真研究与讨论，也就没有提出解决办法。（二）政策观点差。首先是对贯彻统一战线政策认识不足，存在着从任务出发的形式主义思想，或单纯从会议技术上打圈子。其次，对人民代表会议是否已经发挥了应有的作用也很少研究。因为领导干部本身对人民代表会议就存在着形式主义的指导思想，所以人民代表会议的形式主义偏向也就无法纠正。（三）人民代表会议的内容、方法是老一套的，很少提出新的经验。如对省市协商委员会及县常务委员会的活动问题，一直没有研究，所以也没有起到指导作用。产生这一问题的基本原因是：领导作风事务主义，忙于日常琐事，因而忽视了对人民代表会议的政策和具体办法进行系统研究，自然会形成了由上到下的一般化的笼统的领导。这样自然难于使人民代表会真正发挥其应有的作用。整风中明确认识到：真正开好人民代表会议，必须纠正指导思想上及会议本身的形式主义偏向，随时抓住重点研究，随时进行指导；领导干部必须亲自搞好几个典型，吸取经验；并建立深入检查的制度。
    第二，在干部工作中，检查出的主要问题是深入了解干部情况不够。下边干部存在着命令主义作风，但领导上不了解实际情况究竟怎样，因而没有能够及时提出恰当的解决办法。该部对干部工作只停留在一般任免手续、统计数字上面，很少知道他们需要什么，不能进行有效的经常教育与及时的集中训练。工作计划亦变成形式，如要求上半年“把各省市干部工作建立起来……”但如何建立则无下文；又如“上半年解决区村干部工作方法问题”，如何解决，毫不具体。根据上述情况，整风中提出：今后首先应建立起对干部训练教育的制度，改进教育方法，提高干部政策文化水平；并通过人民代表会议来教育干部，转变干部作风。为掌握干部情况，必须做好调查研究工作，抓住典型，组织专门问题的研究。该部已选定二个省干部学校所设的训练班进行检查，帮助纠正教学脱离实际的倾向。
    第三，救灾工作的主要问题是领导不够主动，没有把防灾救灾当作经常的一个任务。如该部对热河灾情缺乏实事求是的估计，没有给下边指示出救灾的主要办法。整风中分析了这种情况，使领导上明确了救灾工作必须要有预见性，及时组织力量深入灾区现地调查，切实组织生产自救。该部整风中发现这一问题后，即组织力量，前往热河检查灾民度冬荒情况，推动各方面协助解决灾民棉衣问题。
    该部各处、科在整风中间掌握了随整随改的方法，在组织机构、分工、手续制度方面都进行了必要调整，因而目前工作效率及工作秩序已大为改进与提高。
