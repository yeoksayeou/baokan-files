　　First Anniversary of the Founding of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
    He Xiangning
    The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has been established for a year now. In this year, the people of China and the Soviet Union have achieved many great results under the same goal of striving for human peace and happiness. Since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance, the Soviet Union's friendly actions towards China, whether in loans, assistance with agricultural and industrial machinery, or the dispatch of technical experts and consultants, have all helped China's construction, promoted production development, and economic prosperity, and have been of great help to our people's livelihood.

    Since the end of 1923, when Mr. Sun Yat-sen put forward the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers, thanks to Chairman Mao's wise leadership, the People's Liberation Army, with its strict discipline and heroic fighting, won a great victory in the People's Liberation War. With the founding of the People's Republic of China, Mr. Sun's revolutionary policies have achieved their goals, and have even surpassed them in excellence. This can not only be a comfort to Mr. Sun, but also allows the Chinese people to stand up and live a happy and joyful life.

    The Soviet Union is the pillar of world peace and democracy, and all peace-loving and democratic countries and people are bound to unite with it. Recently, Soviet representative Malik proposed a proposal for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue at the Security Council, which includes: 1. Inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate and listen to the opinions of the representatives of the Korean people when discussing the Korean issue; 2. Stopping the war in Korea and simultaneously withdrawing foreign troops from Korean territory. This just and reasonable proposal, although obstructed by the reactionary and warmongering US imperialist group, is supported by peace-loving people all over the world. This is a proposal to protect the happiness of all mankind. Our members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, as well as the people of the whole country and the people of Asia, should all actively support this proposal so that it can be realized as soon as possible to safeguard lasting world peace.

　　中苏友好协会总会成立一周年纪念
    何香凝
    中苏友好协会总会成立至今，已有一周年了，这一年来，中苏两国人民在同一的为争取人类和平幸福的目标下，已有许多伟大的成绩，自中苏缔结友好互助条约以来，苏联对中国友好的事实表现中，无论贷款，帮助农业工业机器，及遣派技术专家顾问等，都是帮助我国的建设，使生产发展，经济繁荣，对我国计民生有极大的帮助。
    自一九二三年底，孙中山先生提出联俄、联共、扶助农工的三大政策主张，由于毛主席英明的领导下，解放军纪律严明，英勇作战，人民解放战争获得伟大的胜利，中华人民共和国的成立，孙先生的革命政策，目的已达，并更优良的超过了，这不独可告慰于孙先生，而中国人民由此大翻身，过幸福快乐的生活了。
    苏联是世界和平民主力量的支柱，一切爱好和平民主的国家和人民是必然和他团结在一起的。最近苏联代表马立克在安理会上提出和平解决朝鲜问题的提案，内容：一、邀请中华人民共和国代表参加并在讨论朝鲜问题时听取朝鲜人民的代表陈述意见，二、停止朝鲜境内的战争，并同时自朝鲜境内撤退外国军队，这正直而合理的提案虽受反动的好战的美帝国主义集团的阻挠，但全世界爱好和平的人民都在拥护和支持这提案。这是保卫整个人类幸福的提案，我们中苏友好协会的会员，及全国人民亚洲人民，大家都应踊跃起来支持这提案，使它从速获得实现，来保卫世界的持久和平。
