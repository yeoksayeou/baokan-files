　　Indonesian Surabaya Overseas Chinese Hold Grand Gathering
　　Celebrating the Motherland's First National Day
　　[This newspaper's dispatch] This year, October 1st was the first National Day of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Overseas Chinese in Surabaya (except for a very few reactionaries) celebrated with unprecedented enthusiasm. On this day, early in the morning, every household raised the bright and solemn Five-Star Red Flag and decorated with lanterns and colored hangings. The overseas Chinese on Gabasan Street specially erected a Paifang (archway), topped with five hundred small electric lights. In the center was the Five-Star Red Flag, with a portrait of Chairman Mao in the largest star. This colorful archway shone brightly and dazzlingly at night.
　　At 8:00 AM, the Surabaya Overseas Chinese National Day Celebration Committee held a celebration meeting at the Tambaksari Grand Stadium in the Southern District. More than 10,000 people attended, including students from various schools and overseas Chinese from various community organizations. A temporary rostrum was set up on the site, with a giant portrait of the people's leader Chairman Mao, about two meters high, and a huge Five-Star Red Flag hanging above it. The crowd stood on the lawn facing the sun, each one beaming with joy. At 7:45 AM, Consul Liu Danyi, who had come specially from Jakarta to participate in the celebration, entered the venue accompanied by Zhang Zhinan, chairman of the celebration committee, and was warmly applauded and cheered by the overseas Chinese. After the ceremony began at 8:00 AM, Zhang Zhinan delivered a speech, saying: "Since October 1st of last year, the broad masses of the Chinese people have stood up, holding hands, shoulder to shoulder, closely united under the Five-Star Red Flag and around Chairman Mao, marching towards the bright road."
　　Consul Liu Danyi spoke, giving a detailed report on the rapid political, cultural, and economic construction of the new China under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao over the past year. After representatives of various overseas Chinese organizations delivered speeches, one hundred peace doves were released, each with a red ribbon tied to its foot with the words "Defend World Peace!" written on it. As the doves soared into the sky, the audience applauded thunderously, shouting: "All overseas Chinese unite under the Five-Star Red Flag!" "Intensify the study of New Democracy theory and policies!" "Strive to assist in the construction of New China!" "Fight to defend world peace!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live, long live!"
　　In the evening, the Surabaya Overseas Chinese held a celebratory parade, with torches, lanterns, floats, waist drums, lion dances, and dragon dances, which was extremely lively. The parade did not disperse until late at night. (Wu Xinfa)

　　印尼泗水华侨举行盛会
    庆祝祖国首届国庆
    【本报讯】今年十月一日，是中华人民共和国诞生的首届国庆节，泗水华侨（除了极少数反动分子外）都以空前热烈的情绪狂欢庆祝。这天清早，家家户户升起灿烂庄严的五星红旗，张灯结彩。加巴山街的侨胞特地搭起一座牌楼，顶上装有五百盏小电灯，正中是五星国旗，最大一颗星中是毛主席像。这一座彩楼在夜里光芒四射，辉煌夺目。
    早上八时，泗水华侨庆祝国庆委员会在南区淡峇沙里大球场召开庆祝大会，到会的有各校学生、各社团侨胞一万余人。会场上临时搭了一座主席台，上面挂有高约二公尺的人民领袖毛主席巨像和一面庞大的五星国旗，群众面朝太阳站立在草场上，每一位都兴高彩烈。七时四十五分特自耶嘉达前来参加庆典的刘领事丹一由庆祝委员会主席张植南陪同入场，受到侨胞热烈鼓掌欢呼。八时正行礼如仪后，首由张植南致词，他说：“从去年十月一日起，中国广大的人民站立起来，手拉着手，肩并着肩，紧密地团结在五星旗下及毛主席的周围，朝向光明的大道迈进。”
    刘丹一领事讲话，他对新中国一年来在共产党、毛主席英明领导下的政治、文化、经济建设的突飞猛进作了详细的报告。各侨团代表致词后，放出了一百只和平鸽，每一鸽子的足部系有一条红带，上面写着“保卫世界和平！”当鸽子向着天空高飞的时候，全场掌击雷动，高呼：“全体侨胞在五星旗下团结起来！”“加紧学习新民主主义理论和政策！”“努力协助建设新中国！”“为保卫世界和平而斗争！”“毛主席万岁！”“中华人民共和国万岁！万万岁！”
    晚上泗水华侨举行了庆祝游行，火炬、提灯、花车、腰鼓、舞狮、舞龙，极为热闹。游行队伍至深夜始散。  （吴新发）
