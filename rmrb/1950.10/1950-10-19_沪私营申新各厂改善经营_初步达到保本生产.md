　　Shanghai Private Shenxin Factories Improve Operations
    Initially Achieve Break-Even Production
    With strong government support, funds are loaned and commissioned for spinning; labor and management work together to streamline and economize, reversing losses.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai] The Shanghai factories affiliated with the private Shenxin Textile Company have, due to initial improvements in operations by the capitalists and the hard work of the workers, reversed the situation of losses, and begun to achieve break-even production, with some surplus. Before April, due to poor management, the cost of 20-count yarn per piece in each factory, excluding depreciation, was generally around 270 to 300 discount units. Since the improvement of operations and production began in May, the cost of each factory has been decreasing month by month. By August, the weekly (eight shifts) average had dropped to 210 units, and some factories operating nine shifts had dropped to 205 units. In September, all factories operated at ten shifts. In the first week, the cost of the nine factories further dropped to only 205 units, including depreciation of 14 units. Compared with the labor and processing fee of 224 units, there was already some surplus.

    The company's improvement in operations began with streamlining the organization and reducing redundant personnel. In May of this year, the company abolished the original three general management offices in Shanghai's factories and merged them into the Shenxin General Management Office, which uniformly managed the income and expenditure of each factory, the allocation and procurement of raw materials, and the specifications and prices of finished products. This not only saved about 50 people and improved work efficiency, but also eliminated the phenomenon of mutual contradiction between factories that were previously independent systems. The General Management Office also reasonably adjusted salaries according to the salary standards of the state-owned China Textile Construction Company, appropriately reducing the previously excessive salaries of employees, so that salary expenditure was reduced by one-third. Furthermore, warehouses were cleared to make the best use of materials. In total, materials worth more than 50 billion yuan, which were not directly related to production, were converted into cash to be used as working capital.

    The improvement of Shenxin factories' operations is inseparable from the assistance and support of the People's Government and the employees of each factory. Relevant institutions of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government and state-owned enterprise departments formed a joint group to promote consultations between labor and management in each factory. In mid-May, the Labor-Management Consultation Conference of Shenxin factories was established, which adopted the "Provisional Measures for Employee Salaries" and the break-even production plan. Because the capitalists implemented the resolutions of the Labor-Management Consultation Conference, the production enthusiasm of the employees continued to increase. By August, the average output per spindle of 20-count yarn in 20 hours had reached 0.84 pounds, and in early September it increased to about 0.86 pounds. This greatly exceeded the average level of about 0.7 pounds before the liberation of Shanghai. In addition to working hard in production, employees also took the initiative to practice thrift. For example, in the item of electricity consumption, which accounts for a considerable proportion of the cost, the Ninth Factory reduced the average consumption of 259 kilowatt-hours per piece of yarn in January to only 217 kilowatt-hours in early September. In terms of saving cotton, the Second Factory has reduced the consumption from 417.4 catties per piece of yarn to 411 catties.

    Shenxin Company has more than 390,000 spindles and is the largest private cotton textile enterprise in China. Before the liberation of Shanghai, the company relied on official prices to purchase and sell American cotton at low exchange rates and profited from currency devaluation. After the liberation of Shanghai, part of the funds fled abroad, while expenditures remained extremely large, resulting in serious losses. By the end of April, the factories in Shanghai were heavily indebted and unable to continue production. Later, in addition to the People's Government promoting consultations between labor and management to formulate a break-even production plan, the East China Branch of the People's Bank of China provided loans to the factory, and the state-owned China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company commissioned processing, so that each factory shifted from maintaining production to breaking even or making a profit. Since mid-June, all factories have been commissioned by the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company to process. Currently, some factories are spinning and weaving on their own. The Seventh Factory and the affiliated Hefeng Yarn Factory, which temporarily stopped work in May to supplement the working capital of other factories, are preparing to resume work this month.

    At present, each factory still needs to further reform to overcome some unreasonable phenomena that still exist in the organization and personnel, and should conscientiously fulfill the processing contract, and overcome the phenomena such as failure to deliver goods on time and failure of the delivered goods to meet the prescribed standards.

### 沪私营申新各厂改善经营  初步达到保本生产

　　沪私营申新各厂改善经营
    初步达到保本生产
    政府大力扶助，贷给资金，委托代纺；劳资协力，精简节约，扭转亏损现象。
    【新华社上海电】私营申新纺织公司所属上海各厂，由于资方初步改善经营，工人努力生产，已扭转亏损局面，开始达到保本生产，并有了一定盈余。在四月份以前，各该厂因经营不善，二十支纱每件的成本除折旧费外，总在二百七十到三百个折实单位左右。自五月开始改进经营和生产后，各厂成本即逐月下降，至八月份每周（八班）平均已降到二百一十个单位，部分开九班的已降到二百零五个单位。九月份各厂均开足十班生产，第一周九厂的成本更降到连折旧费十四个单位在内，只合二百零五个单位，和工缴费二百二十四个单位相比，已有一些盈余。
    该公司改善经营，首先是从精简机构、裁减冗员开始的。今年五月，该公司把在上海各厂原有的三个总管理处取消合并为申新总管理处，由总管理处统一管理各厂的收支、原材料调配采购和成品规格售价等。这样不但节省了约五十个左右的人力，提高了工作效率；而且消除了过去各厂自成系统相互矛盾的现象。总管理处又按国营中国纺织建设公司的薪给标准合理地调整了薪资，把职员中过去过高的薪金适当降低，这样薪金支出就比过去减少了三分之一。再则是清理仓库，使物尽其用。计共清理出价值五百余亿元和直接生产无大关系的资财，变成现款，充作流动资金。
    申新各厂改善经营是与人民政府和各厂职工的协助支持分不开的。上海市人民政府有关机构和国营企业部门曾合组小组，推动各厂劳资双方进行协商，在五月中旬成立申新各厂劳资协商会议，通过了“职员工薪暂行办法”和保本生产计划。由于资方执行了劳资协商会议的决议，职工生产情绪不断提高。至八月份，二十支纱二十小时每锭平均产量已达零点八四磅，九月初又增至零点八六磅左右。这就大大地超过了在上海解放前平均总在零点七磅左右的水平。职工们除努力生产以外，并自动厉行节约。如在成本中占相当的比重电力消耗一项，第九厂在一月份平均每件纱用二百五十九度，到九月初已减至只用二百十七度。在节约用棉方面，第二厂已从每件纱用四百一十七点四斤减低至四百十一斤。
    申新公司共拥有纱锭三十九万余枚，为中国私营棉纺业中最大的企业组织。该公司在上海解放前多靠官价低价外汇购售美棉和利用货币贬值牟利，上海解放后，又有部分资金逃往国外，而开支仍极庞大，所以造成严重亏损。到四月底，在上海的各厂负债极巨，无法继续生产。后除经人民政府推动其劳资双方进行协商订出保本生产计划以外，人民银行华东区行并对该厂给以贷款，国营花纱布公司又委托代纺，使各该厂由维持生产走向了保本或盈余。各该厂自六月中旬起全部为花纱布公司代纺，目前有部分自纺自织。在五月份暂时停工以补足其他各厂周转资金的七厂和附属合丰纱厂，已准备在本月复工。
    目前各该厂仍需进一步进行改革，以克服机构、人事中还存在的某些不合理现象，并应认真履行代纺合约，克服有时不能按期交货和所交货品不合规定标准等现象。
