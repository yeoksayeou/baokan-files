　　Aid Korea, Combat American Aggressors!
    Letters from Students of Teachers College and Beijing No. 3 Boys' Middle School

    (I)
    American imperialism launched a war of aggression against Korea, unreasonably obstructed our country from participating in the United Nations, invaded our Taiwan, and repeatedly violated our sacred territorial waters and airspace, killing and wounding our compatriots. This series of insane provocations has brought our anger to a level that can no longer be tolerated.

    We clearly know that the American imperialists' aggression against Korea is part of a plan to invade China and all of Asia, and even enslave the people of the world. In order to safeguard lasting world peace and defend our motherland, we must display a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, completely annihilate the American aggressors who dare to invade our motherland, and immediately give the Korean people, who are in a difficult struggle, the assistance they deserve.

    We want peace, but we are not afraid of war. In today's world where American imperialism runs rampant everywhere, we can only extinguish the flames of aggression in order to win true peace.

    (II)

    We have read and discussed Premier Zhou's report, "Striving to Consolidate and Develop the People's Victory," repeatedly. This is a very glorious document in the political life of our people. Through studying this document, we have become even more determined to liberate Taiwan and Tibet, defend peace, and resist American imperialist aggression.

    The achievements of our motherland in the past year have been tremendous: we have stopped long-term inflation, unified the national financial and economic work..., but the American aggressors, disregarding the peaceful efforts and repeated warnings of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, continue to massacre the free people of our neighboring country, expand the war of aggression, and seriously threaten the security of our motherland.

    When the Soviet Socialist Republic was first established, fourteen imperialist countries launched a crazy armed intervention against the young Soviet Republic. Today, American imperialism attempts to strangle the freedom of the Korean people and attempts to spread the flames of the war of aggression to China. Premier Zhou's report is the solemn declaration of the entire Chinese people. "The Chinese people love peace, but in order to defend peace, they have never been and will never be afraid of resisting wars of aggression. The Chinese people can never tolerate foreign aggression, nor can they stand idly by while the imperialists肆行invade their neighbors." We firmly support this report, and in order to defend our motherland and aid our neighbor, Korea, we must intensify our studies and work, and be ready for the battle against aggression at all times.

    (III)

    The unreasonable aggression of American imperialism has aroused the anger of peace-loving and democratic people all over the world. All of our school's students also unanimously protest the mad atrocities of American imperialism. We warn American imperialism: We Chinese people are liberated and no longer afraid of you. Look, how powerful our people's strength is! We have the power to stop any aggression, defend our borders, and smash your provocations!

　　援助朝鲜，打击美国侵略者！
    师大及京市男三中等同学分别来信
    （一）
    美帝国主义发动对朝鲜的侵略战争，无理阻挠我国参加联合国，侵略我国台湾、及屡次侵犯我神圣的领海、领空杀伤我们的同胞。这一连串疯狂的挑衅行为，已使我们的愤怒，达到再也不能容忍的程度。
    我们清楚地知道，美帝的侵略朝鲜，是侵略我们中国和整个亚洲，以至奴役全世界人民的计划的一部分。为了维护世界的持久和平，保卫祖国，我们要发挥高度的爱国主义精神和国际主义精神，把敢于侵犯我们祖国的美国侵略者干脆消灭，并立即给在坚苦斗争中的朝鲜人民以应有的帮助。
    我们要和平，但我们也不害怕战争。在美帝国主义到处横行无忌的今天，我们只有扑灭侵略的火焰，才能争取真正的和平。

    周总理的报告“为巩固与发展人民的胜利而奋斗”，我们已经再三地阅读过和讨论过了。这是我国人民政治生活中一个极光辉的文件，通过这一文件的学习，我们更加坚定了解放台湾、西藏，保卫和平、反抗美帝侵略的决心。
    我们祖国一年来的成就，是巨大的：我们已经制止了长期的通货膨胀，统一了全国的财经工作……，可是，美国侵略者竟不顾苏联以及人民民主国家的和平努力和再三警告，不断地屠杀着我们邻邦的自由的人民，扩大侵略战争，严重地威胁着我们祖国的安全。
    当苏维埃社会主义共和国刚成立不久的时候，十四个帝国主义国家曾对年轻的苏维埃共和国进行过疯狂的武装干涉。今天，美帝企图扼杀朝鲜人民的自由，企图把侵略战争的火焰，延烧到中国。周总理的报告，就是全中国人民的庄严宣言。“我们中国人民热爱和平，但为了保卫和平，从不也永不害怕反抗侵略战争。中国人民决不能容忍外国的侵略，也不能听任帝国主义者对自己的邻人肆行侵略而置之不理。”我们坚决拥护这一报告，并且，为了保卫我们的祖国和援助我们的邻邦——朝鲜，更要加紧学习和工作，时刻准备着反侵略的战斗。

    美帝国主义无理的侵略，已激起了全世界爱好和平民主的人民的愤怒。我们全校同学，也一致抗议美帝国主义疯狂的暴行。我们警告美帝国主义：我们中国人民都解放了，再也不怕你了。你看，我们人民的力量是如何的强大！我们有力量制止任何侵略，保卫我们的边疆，粉碎你们的挑衅！
