　　The Gongxiao Cooperative of Longyao County, Hebei Province
    Rushes to Save Over 200,000 Jin of Wheat
    Comrade Editor:
    Since learning how to follow the mass line, the personnel of the county and district Gongxiao Cooperatives of Longyao County, Hebei Province, have demonstrated a high degree of responsibility in their work. On August 19th and 20th, there were consecutive heavy rains, causing many houses to collapse. Comrade Wang Bolin, director of the county Gongxiao Cooperative, inspected the warehouses four times in a row despite the rain. During the last inspection, he discovered that the west wall of the warehouse had collapsed. He organized several comrades to cover the grain with mats, and then immediately convened a meeting of all staff, explaining that if the grain stored in the warehouse was not moved in time, it would be in danger of being soaked and spoiled. Under the personal leadership of Director Wang, all thirty-one cadres of the cooperative acted together, moving grain and transferring it from the damaged warehouse despite the rain. Some used sacks to carry it on their backs, while others carried it with cloth bags on their shoulders. Sun Kuangshi, a 54-year-old man, fell in the mud but got up and insisted on carrying the grain. The young man Du Jinzhang wore out his jacket, so he carried it bare-backed. The move from the old warehouse to the new warehouse was about one li back and forth. Thanks to everyone's courageous rescue efforts, more than 40,000 jin of wheat were moved in less than four hours. The Dahuoqu District Gongxiao Cooperative and the Chengguan District Gongxiao Cooperative did the same. The cadres stayed up all night during the heavy rain, taking turns guarding the warehouses.
    The above-mentioned county and district three Gongxiao Cooperatives collectively rescued 200,800 jin of wheat and 300,000 jin of bean cake. Their high degree of responsibility to the people is worthy of our learning.
                                The Committee of Longyao County, Hebei Province, Xu Zizhen

　　河北省隆尧县供销社
    抢救麦子二十万余斤
    编者同志：
    河北隆尧县县、区供销社人员，自学习怎样走群众路线后，在工作中表现了高度的负责精神。八月十九、二十两日连下大雨，倒塌了很多房屋。县供销社主任王柏林同志曾冒雨连续检查仓房四次，在最后一次检查时，发现仓房西墙倒了，他便组织几个同志用席子把粮食盖好，然后立刻召集全社人员开会，向大家说明仓房存粮如不及时移动，便有被淋湿而霉烂的危险。在王主任亲自率领下，全社三十一个干部一齐行动，冒着雨水移粮倒仓，有的用麻袋背，有的用布袋扛。五十四岁的老汉孙匡士在泥泞中滑倒了又爬起来，坚持着搬运粮食；青年杜锦章把小褂子磨破了，他就光着脊背扛。由旧仓移到新仓，往返一里路。由于大家奋勇抢救，不到四个钟头便将四万斤麦子搬运完了。大霍区供销合作社和城关区供销合作社，亦是如此，干部们在下大雨时彻夜不睡，轮班看守仓房。
    以上县、区三个供销合作社共抢护麦子二十万零八百斤，豆饼三十万斤。他们这种高度为人民负责的精神，是值得我们学习的。
