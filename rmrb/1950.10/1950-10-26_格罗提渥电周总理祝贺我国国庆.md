　　Grotewohl Sends Telegram to Premier Zhou to Congratulate China's National Day
    [Xinhua News Agency] Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic, sent a telegram to Premier Zhou to congratulate China's National Day. The text of the telegram is as follows: To Mr. Zhou Enlai, Premier of the People's Republic of China:
    On the occasion of the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, on behalf of the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic and myself, I would like to express my most sincere congratulations to you, to the Government of the People's Republic of China, and to the Chinese people.
    The founding of the People's Republic of China is an event of world historical significance. It is the victorious result of the arduous and glorious struggle of the Chinese people, under the leadership of their outstanding statesman and leader Mao Zedong, at the head of the glorious Communist Party, against internal and external oppressors. This victory of the Chinese people points out the path of their national and social liberation to all nations still under the oppression of the imperialist powers.
    The People's Republic of China's joining of the peace camp led by the Soviet Union and Marshal Stalin, and the close unity of the Chinese people with the Soviet Union and the peoples of the people's democracies, gives the ever-growing peace camp an invincible strength, a force that will shatter the conspiracies of the imperialist war-mongers.
    I believe that the recent appointment of the meritorious General Ji Pengfei as head of the diplomatic mission shows the increase in friendship towards the German Democratic Republic, and that the consolidation and improvement of the relations between our two nations through the current negotiations on a broad trade agreement is a very significant milestone in the development of close and friendly cooperation.
    I congratulate you, your government, and the Chinese people on achieving more great victories on the glorious road of building a new China.
         German Democratic Republic Premier Grotewohl [signed]
          September 30, 1950

　　格罗提渥电周总理祝贺我国国庆
    【新华社讯】德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥曾致电周总理，祝贺我国国庆。电文如下：中华人民共和国总理周恩来先生：
    际此中华人民共和国成立一周年纪念日，谨代表德意志民主共和国临时政府及我自己，向您，对于中华人民共和国政府以及中国人民表示我最衷心的祝贺。
    中华人民共和国的成立，乃是一件具有世界历史意义的事件。它是中国人民在以他们卓越的政治家和领袖毛泽东为首的光荣的共产党领导之下，反对内外压迫者艰苦和光荣斗争的胜利结果。中国人民的这一胜利，给尚在帝国主义列强压迫之下的各民族指出他们的民族解放与社会解放的道路。
    中华人民共和国之加入以苏联及斯大林大元帅为领导的和平阵营，中国人民与苏联及人民民主国家各民族之紧密团结，给予威力与规模不断增长的和平阵营以一种不可战胜的力量，这种力量将粉碎帝国主义战争贩子们的阴谋。
    我认为：最近任命勋功昭著的姬鹏飞将军为外交使团团长这件事表现出对德意志民主共和国友谊的增进，以及通过目前关于一个广泛的贸易协定的谈判对我们两个民族间关系的巩固和改善，是亲密友好合作发展中一个极有意义的里程碑。
    我向您祝贺，您的政府以及中国人民在建设一个新中国的光辉道路上，获得更多的伟大胜利。
         德意志民主共和国总理  格罗提渥签字
          一九五○年九月三十日
