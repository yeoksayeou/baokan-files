Celebrating the First Anniversary of the Founding of New China
Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang

Article 1 of The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates: "The People's Republic of China is a New Democratic, that is, a People's Democratic state, practicing the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, uniting all democratic classes and domestic nationalities, opposing imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism, and striving for China's independence, democracy, peace, unification and prosperity."

Such a brand-new People's Republic of China has been established for a year. The work in this short year is only a beginning in the great and arduous nation-building project, but it has already achieved brilliant and splendid achievements.

First of all, in the task of anti-imperialism, the People's Government has more clearly changed the history of China's foreign relations over the past century. Since the People's Liberation Army achieved a basic victory on the mainland, the forces of imperialism in China have been fundamentally eradicated. Under the new situation, the People's Government has established normal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, various new democratic countries, and some capitalist countries in the past year. The epoch-making major event that must be particularly pointed out is the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance on February 14 this year. This shows that more than 700 million people, accounting for more than one-third of the world's population, are firmly united. This not only consolidated the victory of the Chinese revolution, but also greatly encouraged the liberation struggles of the oppressed nations in the East, strengthened the strength of the international peace and democracy camp, safeguarded world peace, and promoted the progress of human society.

Secondly, in terms of eliminating domestic feudal remnants, the People's Government is continuing and carrying out land reform on an unprecedentedly large scale. Last winter, land reform was successfully completed in some areas of North China and Henan, with a total of about 26 million agricultural population. This year, after full preparation, this work will begin in a vast area with a population of about 100 million agricultural people. The Land Reform Law promulgated on June 30 this year and the decision on dividing rural class components passed on August 4 are two important documents in this great work. This shows that the government is making its best efforts to ensure that this land reform work is carried out in a led, planned, and orderly manner, and will not allow confusion to occur. The completion of this work will undoubtedly make our country more consolidated than ever before, and will "liberate rural productive forces, develop agricultural production, and pave the way for the industrialization of New China."

Thirdly, in the economic field, bureaucratic capitalism has long been eliminated with the elimination of the reactionary rule. This is one of the main tasks of the Chinese people's liberation cause. In the new democratic economic construction, the government first realized the unified management and unified leadership of national financial and economic work, strived for a balance of financial revenue and expenditure, curbed inflation, and stabilized prices. Subsequently, in the industrial and commercial sectors, the relationship between public and private sectors and the relationship between labor and capital have been effectively improved, existing industries and commerce have been rationally adjusted, and the blindness in the economy has gradually decreased due to the strengthening of government guidance; thus, the entire social economy has been able to recover rapidly and achieve certain development. Within two or three years, with the gradual completion and final completion of land reform, the country's financial situation will gradually improve and reach a basic improvement; there is no doubt about this.

The above is just a general overview of the People's Government's policies in the past year in terms of the three major tasks of anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucratic capitalism. Here, we can definitely say: all the government's policies are based on the provisions of the Common Program; its policy is completely correct; its progress is very fast; and its achievements are remarkable.

Everyone knows that the Chinese revolution was successful under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party; similarly, we must also know that the construction of New China has achieved such great achievements today only under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. Of course, a year of effort is only the first step in a long journey, but it is undoubtedly a good start. A good start guarantees a smooth future. Brightness shines all over China, we must move forward under the banner of Mao Zedong!

Today, we celebrate the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with the most enthusiastic feelings, and we must also complete the unfinished revolutionary tasks with the most resolute will. This task is—to liberate Taiwan and completely smash the US imperialist aggression against Chinese territory! The heroic and invincible People's Liberation Army, together with the people of the whole country, have liberated vast areas of East China, South China, Northwest China and Southwest China in less than a year; now, the people of the whole country must work harder to support our People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan, that isolated island. We firmly believe that this great task can definitely be accomplished.

### 庆祝新中国诞生的一周年

　　庆祝新中国诞生的一周年
    中国国民党革命委员会主席  李济深
    人民政协共同纲领第一条规定：“中华人民共和国为新民主主义即人民民主主义的国家，实行工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的、团结各民主阶级和国内各民族的人民民主专政，反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义，为中国的独立、民主、和平、统一和富强而奋斗”。
    这样一个崭新的中华人民共和国成立已经一周年了。短短一年间的工作在伟大艰巨的建国工程中只不过是一个开端，可是已经获得了辉煌灿烂的成就。
    首先，在反帝国主义这一任务上，人民政府更明确地改变了中国近百年来对外关系的历史。自从人民解放军在大陆上取得基本胜利之后，帝国主义在华的势力，已从根本上被拔除了，人民政府在新的形势之下，一年来与苏联、各新民主主义国家以及若干资本主义国家，建立了正常的外交关系。特别须指出的划时代的重大事件，就是今年二月十四日中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订。这说明着，占全世界人口三分之一以上的七万万多人民是坚固地团结在一起了。这不仅巩固了中国革命的胜利，并且大大鼓励了东方各被压迫民族的解放斗争，增强了国际和平民主阵营的力量，保障世界和平，推动人类社会前进。
    其次，在消灭国内封建残余方面，人民政府是继续并且以空前巨大的规模在进行土地改革。去年一冬，在华北和河南的若干地区，总共约有二千六百万农业人口的地区，已经顺利地完成了土改。今年，经过了充分的准备之后，目前就又将在约有一亿农业人口的广大地区开始进行这一工作。本年六月三十日公布的土地改革法和八月四日通过的关于划分农村阶级成份的决定，乃是这一伟大工作中的两个重要文件。这说明着，政府是尽最大的努力，要保证把这一土改工作做到有领导的、有计划的、有秩序的改革，而不容许发生混乱的现象。这项工作的完成，无疑将使我们的国家达到从来未有的巩固，将要“解放农村生产力，发展农业生产，为新中国的工业化开辟道路”。
    第三，在经济方面，官僚资本主义早已随着反动统治的消灭而消灭，这是中国人民解放事业主要任务之一。在新民主主义经济建设上，政府首先实现了全国财经工作的统一管理和统一领导，争取了财政的收支平衡，制止了通货膨胀，稳定了物价。随着，在工商业方面，公私关系和劳资关系已经做到了切实的改善，现有工商业已在合理地调整，经济中的盲目性已因着政府指导的加强而逐渐减少；这样，就使整个社会经济得以迅速地恢复，并且获得了一定的发展。在两三年之内，随着土地改革的逐步完成和最后完成，国家财经状况就将逐步好转以达于基本好转；这是毫无疑问的。
    以上是就着反帝、反封建和反官僚资本三大任务来看人民政府一年来的施政情况，所举的只不过是荦荦大端。在这里，我们可以确定地说：政府的施政无一不是依据共同纲领的规定；其方针是完全正确的；其进度是很快的；其成绩是斐然可观的。
    谁都知道，中国的革命是在毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导之下才获得成功；同样，我们更要知道，新中国的建设也只有在毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导之下才获得了今天这样伟大的成就。当然，一年的努力只不过是万里长征的第一步，可是无疑这是一个良好的开端。良好的开端就保证着前途的顺利。光明普照全中国，我们要在毛泽东旗帜之下前进！
    我们今天以最热烈的心情来庆祝中华人民共和国成立第一周年的国庆日，我们还要以最坚决的意志去完成尚未完成的革命任务。这任务就是——解放台湾，彻底粉碎美帝国主义对中国领土的侵略！英勇无敌的人民解放军和全国人民在一起，在过去不到一年间就解放了华东、华南、西北和西南的广大地区；现在，全国人民还要更努力地支援我们的人民解放军去解放台湾那一个孤岛。我们坚决相信，这一伟大的任务是绝对可以完成的。
