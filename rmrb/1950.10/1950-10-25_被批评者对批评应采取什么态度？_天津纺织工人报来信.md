What Attitude Should Those Criticized Take Towards Criticism?
    ——Letter from Tianjin Textile Workers' Newspaper

To the Editors:

On October 10th, our newspaper (Tianjin Textile Workers' Newspaper) published a letter from Comrade Yang Shuang, a worker at the No. 1 Textile Factory of China, criticizing certain administrative personnel at the No. 1 Textile Factory of China for handling problems improperly; the editor also added a note at the end.

After the letter was published, it aroused dissatisfaction among the leading comrades of the No. 1 Textile Factory of China, who raised objections (mainly saying that Comrade Yang Shuang was backward). Even the factory director, Ge Dichen, requested resignation from the leadership of the China Textile Company, saying that the newspaper's criticism was completely inconsistent with the facts (but without explaining what aspects were inconsistent).

According to our understanding, it is a fact that Comrade Yang Shuang suffers from neurasthenia and often faints, making him unsuitable for night shifts (there are two medical certificates. The union and comrades in the workshop also know this), and it is also a fact that the factory director and military representative used crude methods (such as glaring and stomping feet) to solve Comrade Yang Shuang's ideological problems. We believe that it is appropriate for the factory to provide appropriate care for workers suffering from neurasthenia and frequent fainting. Even if a worker is truly backward and has a bad attitude, the leadership should not use crude and rigid methods to solve the problem. The leadership should help him understand the situation and raise his awareness. After a worker makes a criticism, the leading cadres do not examine themselves, but instead think that it has damaged their reputation, and even use resignation to replace solving the problem. This is wrong.

We are enclosing Comrade Yang Shuang's original letter and our editor's note, hoping that you can offer your opinions on this issue in the newspaper.

Comrade Yang Shuang's Letter to Tianjin Textile Workers' Newspaper and the Newspaper's Editor's Note

To the Editors:

In June of this year, because I was sick – neurasthenia (with a doctor's certificate) – I asked the factory's technician Guo to change my work to the day shift, doing maintenance work, on the one hand to restore my health, and on the other hand to improve my technical level. Technician Guo said it was possible, but had to wait for an opportunity. Later, it happened that maintenance worker Comrade Zhao Xueli was willing to switch with me, and the administration also agreed, saying, "Your spirit of wanting to learn technology is very good, and the administration must find a way to fulfill your wish. Regarding the issue of you two switching jobs, the administration has no objection. Regarding the wage issue, maintenance wages are low, and operation wages are high. You two should discuss it first, and then the administration will decide." (The above was said by technician Guo.) I immediately discussed with maintenance worker Comrade Zhao Xueli, and I would reduce my wage by two jiao, and increase his by two jiao. The administration absorbed the opinions of both sides of the workers, and everyone unanimously agreed. Technician Guo said, "You two can switch." But on the day of the job change, the administration disagreed again, saying that the wage issue could not be decided by you two. I felt that the administration was not responsible enough on this matter and gave me a mental blow. Therefore, I expressed dissatisfaction with the administration. Later, technician Jiang Hongdao saw that I was dissatisfied with the leadership and ordered me to go down to sweep the floor. I said to him, "I should do what I did before." He said, "You are a machine operator, you should operate the machine." I asked, "Then why are you telling me to sweep the floor?" He said, "I just want you to sweep the floor." I asked, "Based on what are you telling me to sweep the floor?" He said, "There is no basis, I just want you to." Therefore, I was even more dissatisfied with the administration, and in anger, I cursed in the street (of course, I also know that cursing in the street is wrong). Finally, I brought this matter to Factory Director Ge Dichen, who not only did not explain to me but said that I was selfish. The factory director said, "Because you are thinking of your own illness, not of the factory, that is selfishness." I said, whom do I work for after I recover from my illness? Whom do I improve my skills for? The factory director said, "Don't talk so far, you are just selfish." I asked the factory director if saying that was suppressing the workers. The factory director glared and said, "Today, we should take suppressive measures against you. If we don't suppress you, what would happen!" I asked the factory director if doing this was right. The factory director glared and stamped his feet and said, "That's how we should deal with you." Military Representative Zhang did not explain either and glared and said that my learning technology was for my own sake. At that time, I was so angry that I fainted. The factory sent me to the hospital. Cursing in the street is wrong, and I will definitely correct this mistake in the future. At the same time, I hope that Comrade Ge Dichen, the factory director of the No. 1 Textile Factory of China, will make a public self-criticism in the newspaper.

          Worker Yang Shuang of the No. 1 Textile Factory of China
              Work Department: No. 1 Textile Factory of China, Second Cleaning Section B

Tianjin Textile Workers' Newspaper Editor's Note: It is appropriate for factory leaders to provide appropriate care for night shift workers suffering from neurasthenia and having medical certificates. However, it is obviously wrong for the No. 1 Textile Factory of China to initially allow care for sick workers and then adopt a forceful attitude to solve the workers' ideological problems and their reasonable demands (although some places are inappropriate).

It is inappropriate for a factory's leading comrades to not listen to workers' opinions and instead adopt a glaring and stomping approach to solve problems.

The nature of general industrial workers is straightforward, but when encountering practical difficulties, they may inevitably have a rigid attitude. Leading cadres need to patiently persuade and educate them to make the workers feel sincerely convinced.

Secondly, Comrade Yang Shuang himself should also realize that transferring jobs (from the operation to the maintenance department) is difficult, and the wage is determined by the seniority and technical skills of the maintenance worker, and cannot be decided arbitrarily by oneself. According to our understanding, in general textile factories in China, maintenance workers with two or three years of experience have wages of more than eight jiao, and new workers will have even less; if the person decides to reduce only two jiao, it is obviously unreasonable. In addition, it is also wrong to curse people in anger.

Finally, we ask the administrative leadership of the No. 1 Textile Factory of China to seriously examine this matter and give Comrade Yang Shuang appropriate work.

People's Forum Editor's Note:

Based on the letter from the Tianjin Textile Workers' Newspaper Editorial Department, we believe that the newspaper editor's note is correct. If the factory believes that Comrade Yang Shuang's letter has inaccuracies, it should make factual corrections based on specific facts; if it believes that the Tianjin Textile Workers' Newspaper editor's note is inappropriate, it can also raise arguments for correction.

It is not a reasonable attitude for the leading comrades of the No. 1 Textile Factory of China to resign because of criticism from the newspaper.

### 被批评者对批评应采取什么态度？——天津纺织工人报来信

专栏：

　　被批评者对批评应采取什么态度？
    ——天津纺织工人报来信编辑同志：
    十月十日，我报（天津纺织工人报）刊载了中纺一厂杨双工友的来信，对天津中纺一厂某些行政人员处理问题不妥当提出了批评；文末并由编者加了按语。
    信件发表后，引起了中纺一厂领导同志的不满，提出了反对意见（主要是说杨双工友落后）。甚至厂长葛涤尘向中纺公司领导上请求辞职，说是报纸的批评是完全不符合事实（但没有说明什么地方不符合事实）。
    据我们了解，杨双工友患神经衰弱症，时常晕倒，不宜上夜班是事实（有医师证明信二件。工会、本车间工友也都知道），而该厂厂长、军代表采用粗暴的方式（如瞪眼跳脚）来解决杨双工友的思想问题也是事实。我们认为，厂方对患神经衰弱症、且经常晕倒的工友加以适当照顾是应当的。即使某一工友真的落后、态度不好，领导上也不应用粗暴生硬的方式去解决问题。领导上应该帮助他搞通思想，使他提高觉悟。在工友提出批评后，领导干部不加检讨，反认为是打击了他的情面，甚至以辞职来代替解决问题。这是不对的。
    兹将杨双工友的原信及我们的按语附上，希望你们能在报纸上提出对这个问题的意见。
                天津纺织工人报编辑部
    杨双工友给天津纺织工人报的信及该报编辑部的按语编辑同志：
    今年六月间，因为我身体有病——神经衰弱（有医师证明），要求本厂郭技师把我的工作改为日班，做保全工作，一方面为了恢复我的健康，另一方面为了把我的技术水平提高一步。郭技师说是可以的，但要等待机会。后来恰好有保全工友赵学礼同志愿意和我调换，行政也同意了，说：“你想学技术，这种精神是很好的，行政一定要想办法成全你的志愿。关于你俩调换工作问题，行政没有意见。工资问题，保全工资低，运转工资高，你俩先研究一下，行政再决定。”（以上是郭技师讲的）我即和保全工友赵学礼同志商量，我的工资降低两毛钱，给他增加两毛钱。行政上吸取了两方面工友的意见，大家一致同意了。郭技师说：“你俩就调换吧。”可是到调换工作的那一天，行政上又不同意了，说工资问题不能由你俩决定。我觉得行政上对这件事情是不够负责的，给了我精神上一个打击。因此我对行政上表示不满。后来技术员姜鸿道同志见我对领导上不满，即命令我下车去扫地。我就对他说：“我以前作什么，就应该让我作什么。”他说：“你是看车的，应当看车。”我问：“那末为什么叫我扫地？”他说：“我想叫你去扫地。”我问：“根据什么叫我去扫地？”他说：“没有什么根据，我就是想叫你去。”因此，我对行政更是不满了，在气愤中骂了街（当然我也知道骂街是不对的）。最后我把这件事提给厂长葛涤尘同志，他不但不向我解释，反而说我自私自利。厂长说：“因为你为自己的病着想，不为厂方着想，就是自私自利。”我说我把病养好给谁干？我的技术提高一步给谁干？厂长说：“你不要谈的太远了，你就是自私自利。”我问厂长这样讲是不是压制工人，厂长瞪着眼睛说：“今天，对你就应该采取压制办法，不压制你那还了得！”我问厂长这样作是不是对？厂长瞪着眼睛跳着脚说：“就应该这样对付你。”张军代表也不加解释，瞪着眼睛说我学技术是为自己打算。当时我气的昏倒了。厂方就把我送到医院里。骂街是不对的，今后我一定要改正这个错误。同时，希望中纺一厂厂长葛涤尘同志在报纸上作公开检讨。
          中纺一厂工人  杨双
              工作部门：中纺一厂二清乙
    天津纺织工人报编者按：工厂领导同志对患神经衰弱症，并有医师证明的夜班工友，加以适当照顾是应当的。但中纺一厂对有病工友事先允许给予照顾，事后采用强暴的态度来解决工友的思想问题及其提出的合理要求（虽然某些地方欠妥当），显然是不对的。
    一个工厂的领导同志，不去倾听工人意见，反而采取瞪眼跳脚的方式来解决问题，我们认为是不妥当的。
    一般产业工人的性情是直爽的，但在遇到实际困难问题有时不免态度生硬。领导干部就需要耐心地加以说服教育，使工人感到心悦诚服。
    其次，工友杨双自己也应当认识到调动工作（由运转调至保全部门）是有困难的，工资也是随着保全工工龄、技术的情况来决定，不能由自己随便决定。据我们了解，中纺一般工厂，有二三年工龄的保全工工资是八毛多，新手就会更少；如果由本人决定只减两毛，显然也是不合理的。另外，因气愤骂人也是不对的。
    最后，我们要求中纺一厂行政领导上很好的检讨这件事情，并给杨双工友以适当的工作。
    人民园地编者按：
    根据天津纺织工人报编辑部的来信，我们认为该报编者的按语是正确的。厂方如果认为杨双工友的信有不符事实的地方，应该根据具体事实作实事求是的更正；如果认为天津纺织工人报编者的按语有不妥当的地方，亦可提出辩正的意见。
    中纺一厂领导同志因受到报纸批评而提出辞职，这不是合理解决问题的态度。
