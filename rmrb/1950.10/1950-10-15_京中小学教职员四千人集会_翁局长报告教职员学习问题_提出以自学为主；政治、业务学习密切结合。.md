[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff Learning Committee held a city-wide teachers and staff conference at 6 PM on the 7th at the Labor Theater of the Working People's Cultural Palace. Director of the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education and Chairman of the Learning Committee, Weng Dujian, reported on the learning issues of primary and secondary school teachers and staff. Nearly four thousand primary and secondary school teachers and staff attended the lecture.

Director Weng first affirmed the achievements of primary and secondary school teachers and staff in learning during the year and a half since the liberation of Beijing. After learning, Beijing's educators have initially accepted the life view of serving the people, exposed and initially criticized the feudal, comprador, and fascist reactionary and backward educational thoughts. Teachers and staff have generally improved their political and professional levels and have established learning organizations, learning systems, and created many learning methods. In professional learning, especially through this summer vacation learning, teachers have further clarified their teaching viewpoints and corrected their teaching thoughts. They have a more correct understanding of conducting political and ideological education in teaching and connecting with reality. They have also initially solved several specific problems in current teaching. For example, in terms of teaching materials, the history department formulated teaching outlines for the general history of China, modern history of China, and foreign history, and studied the repetition of teaching materials in senior and junior high schools and the connection between high school and university teaching materials; the geography department studied the world geography outline; the foreign language teaching material research committee preliminarily formulated standards for compiling teaching materials and compiled trial English teaching materials for the first, second, and third grades of senior high school for the first semester; each natural science group universally researched and criticized the textbooks used; the mathematics group preliminarily determined the key points of each mathematics course. In terms of teaching methods, the recognition of teachers' preparation before class and inspection after class has generally been strengthened, the subjective teaching methods of the past that did not proceed from students' acceptance ability were criticized, and the correction and guidance of student assignments were studied.

However, there are still shortcomings in learning. For example, in terms of organizational leadership, the unified leadership of the Municipal Learning Committee is necessary and has played a certain role, but due to the imperfect organizational structure, the plans are not thorough and timely, and the supervision is insufficient in the work, which has affected the work. Some school administrative authorities do not pay enough attention to learning, and there is a mentality of simply relying on the Municipal Learning Committee. They have not helped teachers and staff learn according to the specific conditions of each school, and the administrative leadership has failed to play an active role. In addition, some teachers and staff lack the spirit of self-study and research, which also affects the improvement of learning. They do not base their learning on personal self-study, but rely solely on collective (group) learning, which makes learning become a formality.

Secondly, Director Weng raised several problems existing in the current learning and explained them. First, the issue of the compulsory and voluntary principles of learning: Although the principle of voluntariness has been repeatedly put forward in the past, it has not been implemented well due to the lack of active efforts in practical work, which has caused some teachers and staff to reluctantly participate in learning, feeling that learning is a burden. Director Weng emphasized that the learning of teachers and staff must be truly voluntary in order to gain something. Second, the issue of self-study and collective learning: Group learning has become the current popular learning method, and generally people even think that learning must be collective. In the early days of liberation, group learning played a very important role, but if we still stay at this stage, learning will not be improved. In order to further combine learning with personal thoughts and needs and conduct systematic learning, future learning must be based on self-study. Necessary discussions and observations based on self-study and research will be effective. Third, systematic theoretical learning and solving individual practical problems: Some teachers and staff believe that what is urgently needed at present is to solve specific problems one by one, while ignoring systematic theoretical learning. Director Weng pointed out that this view is incorrect. He believes that systematic, planned, and step-by-step theoretical learning is very necessary because it is the basis for solving specific problems. Fourth, the relationship between political learning and professional learning: Some people think that learning should be mainly political, while others think that it should be mainly professional. In fact, the two are inseparable. Political and professional learning must be closely integrated to meet the current needs of teaching and improve teaching quality.

Director Weng reported on the Municipal Learning Committee's learning plan for the 1950 academic year. The guiding principle for future learning is to continue to carry out political learning and professional learning on the existing basis, and to closely integrate the two, in order to meet the needs of teaching and further improve the teaching level. Regarding the content and methods of learning, in terms of political theory learning, on the one hand, a combination of systematic lectures and self-study is adopted. The Municipal Learning Committee organizes lectures based on the basic content of the Common Program and combines it with current affairs policies. Primary and secondary school teachers and staff can participate voluntarily and can freely organize discussions in different ways according to their needs. On the other hand, the Municipal Learning Committee proposed six books: "Common Program", "On New Democracy", "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship", "A Brief History of Social Development", "Political Economy", and "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism". Teachers and staff of each school can choose one of them according to the specific situation and needs under the leadership and help of the school and district learning committees to organize different types of learning. In terms of professional learning, the middle schools are based on the teaching groups of each subject, and the city-wide subject learning associations or teaching research associations organize lectures to assist. The primary schools are directly led by the district learning committees to organize the professional learning of the schools. When conditions permit, city-wide teaching research organizations can also be organized by subject and lectures can be held. Regarding the organizational leadership of learning, the grassroots leading organization of middle schools is based on the school, with the principal as the main person, and organizes the school learning committee. The principal should be responsible for leading and constantly helping the teachers and staff to learn. Primary schools should form district learning committees under the leadership of the heads of the district culture and education sections to specifically lead the learning of teachers and staff in each district. The cultural and educational committee members of the trade union should also participate in the learning committees at all levels to specifically help members learn. Finally, Director Weng also emphasized that the key to the success or failure of learning lies in fully developing the conscious and voluntary research of teachers and staff and the active leadership of the administrative heads of each school.

　　京中小学教职员四千人集会
    翁局长报告教职员学习问题
    提出以自学为主；政治、业务学习密切结合。
    【京市新闻处讯】京市中小学教职员学习委员会于七日下午六时在劳动人民文化宫劳动剧场召开全市教职员大会，由学委会主任委员文教局翁独健局长报告中小学教职员学习问题。出席听讲的中小学教职员近四千人。
    翁局长首先肯定了北京解放后一年半以来中小学教职员学习的成绩。北京市的教育工作者经过学习后，已经初步接受了为人民服务的人生观，揭发并初步批判了封建的、买办的、法西斯的反动落后的教育思想。教职员一般地在政治业务水平上都提高了一步，并且建立了学习组织、学习制度和创造了许多学习方法。在业务学习上，特别是通过这次暑期学习，教师们进一步地明确了教学观点，端正了教学思想。对教学中进行政治思想教育和联系实际有了比较正确的认识。并初步解决了目前教学中的几个具体问题。如在教材方面，历史科制订了中国通史、中国近代史、外国史的教学提纲，并研究了高初中教材重复及高中与大学教材的联系问题；地理科研究了世界地理提纲；外国语科教材研究委员会初步拟定了编选教材的标准，编选了高中一、二、三年级上学期的英文试用教材；自然科各组普遍对采用的课本进行了研究和批评；数学组初步确定了各门数学课程的重点。在教学方法上，一般加强了教员在课前准备，课后检查的认识，批判了过去不从学生接受能力出发的主观主义的教学方法，并研究了学生作业批改和指导等问题。
    但是，学习中仍然有缺点存在。如在组织领导方面，市学委会统一领导学习是必要的而且起了一定的作用，但由于组织机构不健全，计划不周到，不及时，在工作中检查督促不够，致使工作受到影响。有些学校行政当局对学习重视不够，存在单纯依靠市学委会的思想，没有根据各校具体情况帮助教职员学习，行政领导未能发挥积极作用。还有，有些教职员缺乏自学与钻研的精神，也影响了学习的提高，他们不把学习建立在个人自学的基础上，而专门依靠集体（小组）学习，致使学习流于形式。
    其次，翁局长提出目前在学习中存在的几个问题，并作了解释。第一、学习的强制性与自愿原则的问题：过去虽曾屡次提出自愿的原则，但是由于在实际工作中缺少积极想办法，所以贯彻得很不够，致使一部分教职员勉强参加学习，感到学习是一种负担。翁局长强调指出，教职员的学习必须是真正自愿的才会有收获。第二、自学与集体学习的问题：小组学习已成为目前流行的学习方式，一般人甚至认为学习一定是集体的。在解放初期，小组学习曾发挥了很重要的作用，但现在若还停留在这个阶段上，学习就无法提高。为使学习进一步结合个人思想和需要，进行系统的学习，今后的学习必须以自学为主，在自学钻研的基础上进行必要的讨论、观摩，才会收到效果。第三，系统的理论学习与解决个别实际问题：有些教职员以为目前所急需的是解决一个个具体问题，而忽视系统的理论学习。翁局长指出这种看法是不正确的。他认为有系统、有计划、有步骤的理论学习是很必要的。因为它才是解决具体问题的基础。第四、政治学习与业务学习的关系问题：有人认为学习应以政治为主，也有人认为应以业务为主，实际上二者是不可分的。必须使政治与业务密切结合，才能符合当前教学的需要，提高教学质量。
    翁局长报告了市学委会一九五○学年度的学习计划。今后学习的方针是在现有基础上继续开展政治学习与业务学习，并使二者紧密结合起来，以期切合教学的需要，进一步提高教学水平。关于学习的内容与方式，在政治理论学习方面，一方面采用系统讲座与自学结合的方式，市学委会根据共同纲领的基本内容，结合时事政策组织讲座，中小学教职员可自愿参加，并可根据需要以不同方式自由组织讨论：另一方面市学委会提出：共同纲领、新民主主义论、论人民民主专政、社会发展简史、政治经济学、辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义等六种书籍，各校教职员可根据具体情况与需要在校、区学委会领导与帮助下任选一种组织不同类型的学习。在业务学习方面，中学各校以各科教学小组为基础，并由全市性的各科学习会或教学研究会组织讲座，加以辅助。小学由区学委会直接领导和组织各校的业务学习。条件许可时，亦可分科组织全市性的教学研究组织并举办讲座。关于学习的组织领导问题，中学基层领导机构以学校为单位，以校长为主，组织校学委会，校长应负责领导和经常帮助教职员的学习。小学应在各区文教科长领导下，组成区学委会，具体领导各区教职员学习，工会文教委员亦应参加各级学委会具体帮助会员的学习。最后，翁局长并强调指出，学习的成败关键，在于充分发挥教职员的自觉自愿的钻研与各校行政首长的积极领导。
