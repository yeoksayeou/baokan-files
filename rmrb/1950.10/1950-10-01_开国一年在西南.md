　　One Year After the Founding of the Nation in the Southwest
　　Deng Xiaoping

　　Immediately following the founding ceremony on October 1, 1949, the troops of our People's Liberation Army's First, Second, and Fourth Field Armies were ordered to march into the Southwest, directly attacking the last stronghold of the American-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang on the mainland and liberating the 70 million people of the Southwest. From the launch of the battle in early November to December 27, it only took 57 days to essentially conclude this campaign. During this period, the People's Liberation Army advanced 2,000 to 3,000 miles, eliminating 900,000 enemy troops.
    After this, we carried out work that was far more difficult than marching and fighting. The efforts of nine months (seven months in Yunnan) have been fruitful.
    The transformation of more than 400,000 former Kuomintang troops who revolted or surrendered has been completed. Except for a few units, all have been reorganized according to the People's Liberation Army's standards. All officers and soldiers have been properly handled, with the vast majority remaining in the army to work or being sent to schools to study.
    The "guerrilla warfare" organized by Kuomintang bandits and special agents who were active everywhere starting in late February has suffered a fatal blow from our bandit suppression troops. 400,000 bandits have been eliminated, and all the more affluent core areas and key transportation routes have been purified. The remaining bandits and special agents who have fled to the border mountainous areas will not be difficult to eliminate.
    Urban work has gradually gotten on track, and social order is consolidated. The people's political study movement has achieved initial results. Workers, students, youth, women, and other masses have been initially organized, and these mass organizations have played an active role in assisting the people's government in various tasks.
    Since overcoming the major price fluctuations around the Lunar New Year, prices have been stable. The adjustment of industry and commerce has achieved significant results, and the relief work for unemployed workers is still in progress. Since July, the market has improved, and unemployment has also decreased. The economic situation of farmers has improved because they have been freed from the various exorbitant taxes and levies of the Kuomintang government and feudal forces, coupled with the suppression of bandits and a harvest of 80% of a normal year. This has allowed farmers to begin to breathe a sigh of relief, and thus the exchange between urban and rural areas is also smoother.
    The public grain for 1949 has been basically completed. Tax revenue has only reached 55% of the total annual revenue for 1950, which is the worst performing of all tasks, but it has also played a huge role in ensuring supply and stabilizing prices.
    The feudal forces in the countryside have been initially hit, and the number of peasant association members has reached about 5 million. People's representative conferences and peasant representative conferences have been widely held in various provinces and cities, and the strength of the people's unity has been enhanced, which has laid the foundation for the rent reduction movement in the countryside this winter and next spring. The establishment of the Southwest Military and Political Committee in July has further strengthened the leadership of the work in the entire region.
    The number of people who have signed the Stockholm Appeal of the World Peace Congress has reached more than 11 million, and the movement is deepening into the countryside. Cultural and educational, health, and other work have also achieved considerable results.
    The achievement of these results is the result of the unity of people from all walks of life and the hard work of cadres at all levels. However, it must be pointed out that many cadres have indeed made mistakes of bureaucracy, especially commandism, in performing their work tasks, and some mistakes are still very serious. In order to correct these errors in work, rectification movements have been carried out everywhere. Due to the full promotion of criticism and self-criticism in the movement, the effect was good, and the cadres have greatly improved their thinking and work style, enabling them to better complete their tasks in future work.
    Pointing out these achievements does not mean that the work in the Southwest has already gotten on the right track. It can only be said that we have initially gained a foothold in our work. In fact, we still have a series of major problems that have not been resolved or have not been resolved well.
    Our fiscal revenue and expenditure are too unbalanced, and the deficit is probably the highest in the country. In particular, the tax revenue performance is too poor and must be resolved with great effort. This situation prevents us from handling many things that should be handled, and often makes our work passive due to financial constraints. In this stage, we rely heavily on central government subsidies, but our eyes should not be looking at central government subsidies for the long term.
    We have no experience in managing industry and have not even gotten started. Some cadres working in our factories do not know how to rely on workers and unite employees to carry out work, and the phenomenon of being divorced from the masses is very serious. Some are still clinging to the methods of managing rural areas or managing the army to manage factories, resulting in complete confusion. There are also many problems with trade union work, which we must put in a primary position to solve in the future.
    Our position in the countryside is still extremely unconsolidated. Although feudal forces have been initially hit, basically, feudal forces are still the actual rulers of the countryside. The organization and awareness of farmers are still very poor, and farmers have gained very little actual benefit. If we do not universally mobilize and organize the farmer masses by leading farmers to carry out a liberation movement, then feudal forces cannot be defeated, and the people's government cannot gain its foundation in the vast countryside. This problem remains to be solved in the rent reduction movement that is about to begin and the land reform movement that will begin next winter.
    On the national issue, we have generally not had any major problems due to the cautious approach we have adopted, which is good. However, the actual development of the situation has required us to further solve more problems, such as the issue of implementing regional autonomy and organizing joint forms of government in areas where multiple ethnic groups live together, and taking concrete and steady steps to help all fraternal ethnic groups develop their economic, cultural, and health undertakings, which should all be included in the specific agenda for the future.
    Completely eliminating the remaining bandit armed forces and severely suppressing special agent saboteurs are even more things that we should be a hundred times more vigilant about and cannot ignore in the slightest.
    In short, because the Southwest was liberated later and there are insufficient cadres, our work efficiency is relatively poor compared to other regions. Our work achievements over the past nine months are only a foundation for advancement, and this is also the result of the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee. If we have illusions, if we do not have a clear understanding of the basic situations that feudal forces are still powerful, bandit and special agent activities are still rampant, and the basic masses have not been fully organized and mobilized, if we become arrogant and negligent because we have achieved some small achievements, this will be an unforgivable mistake.

### 开国一年在西南

　　开国一年在西南
    邓小平
    紧接着一九四九年十月一日开国典礼之后，我们人民解放军第一、第二、第四野战军的部队奉命进军西南，直捣美蒋匪帮在大陆上的最后巢穴，解放西南七千万人民。从十一月初发起战斗到十二月二十七日止，前后不过五十七天，就基本上结束了这个战役。在此期间，人民解放军前进了两千里到三千里，消灭了敌军九十万。
    此后，我们进行了比较行军作战大为繁难的工作，九个月（云南是七个月）的努力是有成绩的。
    四十余万起义或投诚的原国民党军的改造工作已告完成，除个别部队外，都已按照人民解放军方式进行了整编，所有官兵都作了妥善的处置，绝大部分均留在部队工作或送入学校学习。
    从二月底开始到处活动的国民党匪特所组织的“游击战争”，业已遭到我剿匪部队的致命打击，消灭了土匪四十万，所有较富庶的腹心地区和交通要道都已净化，其余窜逃至边沿山地的残余匪特已不难肃清。
    城市工作已逐渐走上轨道，社会秩序是巩固的。人民的政治学习运动已获得初步成绩。工人、学生、青年、妇女及其他群众已有初步地组织起来，这些群众组织在协助人民政府各种工作上，起到了积极的作用。
    自从克服了旧历年前后的物价大波动之后，物价一直是稳定的。调整工商业已获显著成绩，失业工人的救济工作仍在进行。从七月起市场已趋好转，失业现象亦见减少。农民经济情况，由于免除了国民党政府和封建势力的各种苛捐勒索，加上土匪的肃清和今年有八成年景的收成，使农民开始喘过气来，因而城乡交流也较疏畅。
    一九四九年度公粮业已基本完成。税收只征起一九五○年度全年的百分之五十五，这是各项工作中成绩较差的，但在保证供给稳定物价等方面，也起到巨大的作用。
    农村封建势力已受到初步打击，农民协会会员已达五百万人左右。各省市的各界人民代表会议及农民代表会议业已普遍召开，人民的团结力量已见增强，这替今冬明春的农村减租运动，奠定了基础。七月间西南军政委员会的成立，更加强了全区工作的领导。
    在斯德哥尔摩世界和平大会宣言上签名的人数已达一千一百余万人，运动正向农村深入开展中。文化教育、卫生等项工作，亦获得了相当的成绩。
    这些成绩的获得，是各界人民团结和各级干部辛勤努力的结果。但必须指出：不少干部在执行工作任务中，确犯有官僚主义特别是命令主义的错误，有的错误还是很严重的。为了纠正这些工作中的错误，各地一律进行了整风运动。由于在运动中充分地发扬了批评和自我批评，效果良好，干部在思想上和作风上大大地提高了一步，使他们能在今后的工作中更好地去完成自己的任务。
    指出这些成绩，并不是说西南的工作已经步入正轨，只能说我们初步地取得了工作阵地。事实上，在我们面前有一系列的重大问题还没有解决或者解决得不好。
    我们的财政收支太不平衡，赤字之大恐为全国之冠，特别是税收成绩太差，必须努力解决。这种情况，使我们许多应办的事不能办理，常常由于财政上的拮据而使工作陷于被动。这一阶段，我们大部靠中央补贴，而我们的眼睛是不应该长远望着中央补贴的。
    我们在管理工业方面还没有经验，还没有入门。我们有些工厂工作的干部还不懂得依靠工人、团结职员去进行工作，脱离群众的现象是很严重的。有的还固守着管理农村或管理军队的方式去管理工厂，以致弄得一筹莫展。工会工作的问题也很多，这是我们今后必须提到首要地位来加以解决的。
    我们在农村的阵地还极不巩固，封建势力虽已受到初步打击，但基本上，封建势力至今仍然是农村的实际统治者，农民的组织和觉悟程度都还很差，农民所得的实际利益还很少。如果我们不从领导农民进行翻身运动去把农民群众普遍地发动起来和组织起来，那么封建势力是打不倒的，人民政府是不能在广大农村获得自己的基础的。这个问题尚待我们在即将开始的减租运动和明冬开始的土改运动中去解决。
    我们在民族问题上，由于采取了谨慎的方针，一般说来，没有出什么较大的乱子，这是好的。但是实际情况的发展，已经要求我们进一步地去解决更多的问题，例如实行区域自治和在民族杂居区域组织联合形式的政府的问题，采取具体而稳重的步骤去帮助各兄弟民族发展其经济、文化、卫生事业的问题，都应列入今后的具体日程之上了。
    彻底消灭残余土匪武装，严厉镇压特务破坏分子，更是我们应该百倍警惕、不可丝毫忽视的事情。
    总之，西南由于解放较迟，干部不足，比起其他地区说来，我们的工作效率是较差的。我们九个月来的若干工作成绩，只是获得一个前进的基础，而这也是由于毛主席和中央正确领导的结果。如果我们发生错觉，如果我们对于封建势力仍然强大、土匪特务活动仍然猖獗、基本群众尚未充分组织和发动的这些基本情况没有一个清醒的认识，如果我们因为有了一些小小的成绩于是骄傲和疏忽起来，这将是一个不可饶恕的错误。
