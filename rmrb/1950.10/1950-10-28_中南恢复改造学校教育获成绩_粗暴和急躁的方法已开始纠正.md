Xinhua News Agency: Central South Region has achieved considerable success in gradually reforming and restoring existing schools and focusing on building new education. However, many regions have adopted crude and impatient methods in restoring and transforming existing schools, resulting in serious deviations. These deviations have begun to be corrected after being pointed out by the Central South Ministry of Education.

Under the basic policy of striving to unite and transform intellectuals, higher education in the Central South Region has, on the one hand, enriched various revolutionary universities to transform a large number of educated youths and train on-the-job cadres; on the other hand, it has maintained and reformed the existing institutions of higher learning in a step-by-step and planned manner, cultivating many talents for construction. According to statistics from the first half of this year, there are a total of five People's Revolutionary Universities in the region. More than 22,900 students have graduated and been assigned to work in various places, and these five schools currently have more than 11,800 students. In order to meet the needs of national construction, these schools have shifted from a policy of focusing on short-term political training to a longer-term, more standardized direction. For example, Zhongyuan University has added a College of Literature and Art, a College of Finance and Economics, and a College of Education to systematically train cadres in finance, economics, culture, and education.

In the last semester, there were 34 regular public and private institutions of higher learning in the Central South Region, with 19,382 students. The number of students this semester has increased compared to the previous one. More than 3,000 graduates from the last semester have been uniformly assigned by the government to participate in various construction projects.

Due to the implementation of the policy of "maintaining the status quo and gradually reforming," most of the region's primary and secondary schools have united the vast majority of teachers and staff to overcome various difficulties and persist in education in disaster areas. Except for individual cases, the number of primary and secondary schools and teachers and students in various places in the first half of this year increased compared to the second half of last year. In the last semester, there were a total of 1,688 public and private middle schools in the region, with 436,600 students; and 87,152 primary schools, with 5,625,700 students.

In order to implement the educational policy of "opening the door to workers and peasants," schools in various places have absorbed a large number of workers' and peasants' children into schools. The Central South Ministry of Education and the Henan Provincial Department of Education have successively established two worker-peasant quick-track middle schools, with a total of 215 students. Guangzhou and Wuhan are also actively preparing to establish such schools. National Henan University, Zhongyuan University, and others are also training teachers for worker-peasant middle schools.

In order to transform ideology and improve political understanding, schools have systematically carried out political and ideological education, anti-feudal education, and land reform education among teachers, staff and students in accordance with the unified regulations of the Central South Ministry of Education. Teachers and students who have undergone political study and ideological transformation have gradually broken down the erroneous ideas of "working to earn a living" and "studying to get promoted and make a fortune," and have begun to establish a new attitude of working and studying for the country and the people, and have established new morals of loving the country, loving the people, loving labor, loving science, and protecting public property. After the political awareness of teachers, staff and students in Jiangxi Province was raised, more than 3,000 outstanding young people gloriously joined the New Democratic Youth League; and another 21,700 children joined the Young Pioneers. In primary and secondary schools in Jiangxi, Hubei, Wuhan and other provinces and cities, in the face of national financial and economic difficulties, a labor-building school and production-saving campaign was generally launched to overcome financial difficulties and reduce state expenditures. In Wuhan, more than 90 municipal primary schools added 137 classes in the last semester, absorbing 13,759 children of workers and peasants into school, and most of the expenses were solved by teachers and students through production and savings. In the severe spring famine this year, many primary and secondary school teachers in Henan, Hubei, Hunan and other places endured hunger and starvation, implemented the correct policy of "combining education in disaster areas with production to overcome famine," overcame various difficulties, and persisted in education in disaster areas.

On the basis of new political ideas, most of the region's schools have systematically reformed the curriculum and teaching methods.

In terms of improving teaching methods, many school teachers have become accustomed to the method of collective research and preparation of lessons. Many primary and secondary schools in Hubei, Wuhan, and other places have improved the teaching methods of various subjects through observation schools and exchange of experience. At the same time, schools in various places have gradually corrected the two deviations of neglecting regular class learning and emphasizing extracurricular activities, or only focusing on regular class learning and not participating in extracurricular activities.

In restoring and reforming existing schools, some areas of the Central South region, due to a lack of clear understanding of the New Democratic cultural and educational policies and the policy of transforming old intellectuals, have made serious deviations in their work. For example, Guangshan and other counties in Huangchuan Prefecture, Henan, rashly restored many schools without considering the local financial situation. Later, due to financial difficulties, they rashly merged many schools without asking for instructions, resulting in the unemployment of some teachers and staff and the loss of schooling for some students. Some areas in Henan, Hunan, Hubei and other places have adopted the wrong methods of struggle and cleansing when carrying out transformation education for the original teachers and staff, instead of adopting the correct policy of "striving for, uniting, and transforming." Some areas have adopted impatient and mandatory methods when carrying out transformation education for teachers and staff, instead of carrying it out in a planned and step-by-step manner. These deviations have been quickly discovered by the Education Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee, and instructions have been given to various places to immediately correct them.

　　中南恢复改造学校教育获成绩
    粗暴和急躁的方法已开始纠正
    【新华社讯】中南区已在逐步改革和恢复旧有学校、有重点地建设新教育方面，获得不少成绩。但也有不少地区在恢复和改造旧有学校时，采取了粗暴和急躁的方法，造成了严重偏向。这些偏向经中南教育部指出后，已开始纠正。
    中南区的高等教育，在争取团结和改造知识分子的基本政策下，一面充实各革命大学，改造大批知识青年和训练在职干部；一面有步骤，有计划地维持并改革了旧有的高等学校，培养了许多建设人才。据今年上半年统计，全区共有人民革命大学五所。已毕业分发各地工作的学生有二万二千九百余人，该五校现有学员一万一千八百余人。这些学校为了适应国家建设的需要，已由短期政治训练为主的方针转向较长期的正规化的方向发展。如中原大学已增设了文艺学院、财经学院和教育学院，有计划地培养财经和文教工作干部。
    上学期中南全区有正规的公、私立高等学校三十四所，学生一万九千三百八十二人，本学期学生数字已较前增加。上学期毕业生三千余人，已由政府统一分配参加各种建设工作。
    大部地区的中小学校，由于执行了“维持原状，逐步改革”的方针，团结了广大教职员克服了各种困难，坚持了灾区教育。除个别情况外，今年上半年各地中小学校及教职员学生的数字，均较去年下半年增加。全区上学期共有公、私立中学一千六百八十八所，学生四十三万六千六百余人；小学八万七千一百五十二所，学生五百六十二万五千七百余人。
    为了贯彻“向工农开门”的教育方针，各地学校都大量地吸收了工农子弟入学。中南区教育部和河南省教育厅先后举办了工农速成中学两所，共有学生二百一十五名。广州、武汉两市也正在积极筹办。国立河南大学、中原大学等也正为工农中学培养师资。
    为了改造思想，提高政治认识，各学校根据中南教育部的统一规定，在教职员和学生中，有计划地进行了政治思想教育、反封建教育和土地改革教育。经过政治学习与思想改造的教职员和学生，已逐渐打破“工作为了混饭吃”，“学习为了升官发财”的错误思想，开始建立了为国家为人民服务的新工作态度与学习态度，树立了爱国家、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财产的新道德。江西省教职员和学生，在政治觉悟提高以后，有三千多名优秀青年，光荣地参加了新民主主义青年团；另有二万一千七百余儿童，参加了少年儿童队。在江西、湖北、武汉等省市中小学校，在国家财政经济困难的情况下，普遍展开了劳动建校和生产节约运动，克服了经费困难，减少了国家开支。武汉市九十多个市立小学，上学期增加了一百三十七个班，吸收了一万三千七百五十九名工农子弟入学，大部分经费都是由各校师生在生产节约中获得解决的。河南、湖北、湖南等地许多中小学教师，在今年的严重春荒中，忍饥受饿，贯彻“灾区教育与生产度荒结合”的正确方针，克服种种困难，坚持了灾区教育。
    在新的政治思想基础上，大部分地区的学校都有步骤地进行了课程和教学方法的改革。
    在改进教学方法方面，许多学校的教师已习惯于集体研究、准备课业的办法。湖北、武汉等地的许多中小学校，通过观摩学校，交流经验，使各科教学方法都得到改进。同时，各地学校已逐渐纠正了忽视正课学习强调课外活动，或只顾正课学习不参加课外活动的两种偏向。
    中南某些地区在恢复和改革旧有学校时，由于对新民主主义的文教政策和对改造旧知识分子的政策认识不清，在进行工作中，发生过严重的偏向。如河南潢川专区光山等县，不考虑地方财政情况，即轻率地恢复了许多学校，后因经费困难，不经请示又轻率地合并了许多学校，结果造成部分教职员失业和学生失学的现象。河南、湖南、湖北等某些地区，对原有教职员进行改造教育时，曾经采用过斗争和清洗的错误方法，而不是采取“争取、团结、改造”的正确方针。有些地区在对教职员进行改造教育时，曾经采取急躁的强迫命令的方式，而不是有计划、有步骤地进行的。这些偏向，已迅速地为中南军政委员会教育部所发觉，并已指示各地立即纠正。
