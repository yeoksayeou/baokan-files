    [Xinhua News Agency, 10th] Nan Hanchen, President of the People's Bank of China, sent a cable to Eugene Black, President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, on October 10th, declaring that all properties and interests of China in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development belong to the Chinese people, and only the People's Bank of China, as the national bank of the People's Republic of China, has the legal right to handle them. Any illegal handling is invalid. The text of the cable is as follows:

    Mr. Eugene Black, President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development:

    Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, notified you on August 26, 1950, that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legal government representing the Chinese people. The so-called "representatives" of the reactionary remnant clique of the Chinese Kuomintang are now completely unqualified to participate in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and must be expelled from all institutions and meetings of the bank. Accordingly, I am now instructed by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to make the following statement and request to you: All properties and interests of China in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development belong to the Chinese people. Therefore, only the People's Bank of China, as the national bank of the People's Republic of China, has the legal right to handle China's paid-in capital stock and all other properties and interests in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The International Bank for Reconstruction
