Understanding the New Area's Agricultural Tax "Levy Based on Rate"
　　Yi Zhi

Since the rectification campaign, comrades in agricultural tax work have further recognized the consistency between policy and task in theory. However, how to achieve the consistency mentioned above is obviously a problem that urgently needs to be solved. Especially as the autumn harvest tax collection has already begun, some comrades still have insufficient understanding of what it means to comply with the tax rate, which affects the implementation of the policy. In order to correctly solve this problem, I would like to propose several specific issues in the implementation of agricultural tax rates in newly liberated areas for comrades in various regions to study.

I. The "Contradiction" Between Tax Rate and Task

The tax rate and the task are inherently consistent. It is only because deviations occur in the execution that contradictions arise. The deviation is caused, on the one hand, by the failure to grasp accurate figures for population, land, and yield, resulting in a disconnect between the figures at different levels, making the collection lack a reliable basis; on the other hand, mainly in the allocation of tasks, the economic conditions of various regions were not taken into account. This year, the total amount of national grain tax in the newly liberated areas was reduced from 17 percent last year to 13 percent this year, according to the State Council's instructions. Some comrades mistakenly believe that this ratio must be suitable for every region (even county and village). Therefore, when allocating the autumn tax quotas to various regions, regardless of the economic situation of each region, a uniform 13 percent was apportioned on average. As a result, in wealthy or land-concentrated areas, "levying based on rate" by household greatly exceeded the grain quota allocated by the higher authorities, while in poor and land-scattered areas, the task could not be completed. For example, statistics from three villages in Erxian County, Hunan, and three villages in Sanxian County, Jiangxi, show that after "levying based on rate," the average burden accounted for 15 to 20 percent of income, exceeding the original allocated task (i.e., allocated based on 13 percent) by 15 to 55 percent. In the Nanchang Special District of Jiangxi Province, the original task allocated by the province was 270 million catties, but after "levying based on rate," the actual amount that could be completed was 450 million catties. Particularly affluent areas could exceed the original allocated task by 66 percent. For example, in Xingan County, the average grain yield per person is about 1,000 catties, and the average tax rate can reach 22 to 23 percent. In the latter case, such as in northern Jiangsu, some villages were originally allocated according to 13 percent, but the actual levy based on rate could only collect 7 to 8 percent. In this way, cadres in wealthy areas will develop an optimistic idea, mistakenly believing that "this year's task is easy to complete" and that "completing the original task is sufficient," while cadres in poor areas express "lack of confidence" and "inability to complete the task." The current problem is that in areas where "contradictions" have already occurred between policy and task, efforts should be made to appropriately eliminate this "contradiction." In areas where such "contradictions" have not yet occurred, efforts should be made to prevent them from occurring.

When solving the former problem, some areas that have exceeded the task advocate reducing the tax rate, narrowing the scope of the burden, reducing cultivated land or yield, or even repeatedly adopting the method of mechanically dividing classes to assign burdens. Some areas where the task cannot be completed adopt coercive orders, putting forward slogans such as "evaluate and send simultaneously" and "collect grain before adjustment," or forcing the masses to challenge, or simply apportioning it equally, or relying on a few active elements to take the lead in reporting high yields in order to barely complete the task. These methods are all wrong and will not work, and must be quickly corrected. The main thing is to persuade cadres and the masses to make appropriate adjustments based on the rate. This requires ① educating cadres to seriously study the tax law and the policy of reasonable burden, and learn how to calculate the tax rate, so that they can truly act in accordance with the policy; ② deeply understanding the situation, fully grasping the materials, so that the burden can take care of the actual situation in rural areas; ③ explaining the tax law and the principles to the masses, and mobilizing the masses to put forward methods. Only in this way can the phenomenon of excessive or insufficient burden be corrected.

In areas where such "contradictions" have not yet occurred, in addition to mastering accurate figures for the number of acres of land, yield, and population, the following situations should also be taken into account to correctly allocate tasks.

(1) The poverty or wealth of the region and the concentration or dispersion of land. This is the main factor. Because the agricultural tax in the newly liberated areas is "levied on a progressive basis based on the average agricultural income per capita by agricultural population by household." Affluent and land-concentrated areas require taxpayers to bear a higher progressive rate, while poor and land-scattered areas require taxpayers to bear a lower progressive rate. Therefore, for individual regions, it is permissible for the local total burden to exceed or fall short of 13 percent of its total agricultural income according to the policy. However, the general term "land concentration or dispersion" refers to land ownership, while agricultural tax is levied based on income. Therefore, when grasping the above situation, it is necessary to see not only the concentration and dispersion of land ownership, but also the usage of the land.

(2) "The land of tax-paying households that is scattered in other provinces (cities) and other counties (cities)," or the local land of tax-paying households living in other provinces (cities) and other counties (cities). The former is often referred to as "remote estate land" by people in Jiangnan, and the latter is often referred to as "hosted estate land" or "guest land." Article 14 of the Provisional Regulations stipulates different methods for calculating and levying taxes on these two types of land. Last year, the fourth bao of Qingping Township, Changde County, Hunan Province, calculated the total output of the bao during the trial. Twenty percent of it was occupied by other baos. If this type of income is calculated and levied in this bao, the entire bao can be levied 25.7 percent. If it is not calculated and levied in this bao, only 15.8 percent is levied. In some areas where this type of income is particularly large, the difference will be even greater. For example, in Liyu Township, Changsha County, Hunan Province, the estimated burden of this type of income this autumn is 813,870 catties, accounting for 78 percent of the total burden of the entire bao.

(3) For the land of community organizations such as ancestral halls, societies, and schools, "agricultural income cannot be calculated on a per capita basis." Article 13 of the Provisional Regulations stipulates a fixed burden ratio. According to surveys in eight villages in five counties including Anhua, Yiyang, and Ningxiang in Hunan, this type of land accounts for 15.3 percent of the total cultivated land, which will have a great impact on the local average tax rate.

(4) The situation of tenancy, because Article 15 of the Provisional Regulations stipulates: "The income from leased land...is calculated as 120 catties for every 100 catties," "The income from tenanted land...is calculated as 80 catties for every 100 catties." Areas with more rental income will inevitably have higher tax rates, while areas with more tenanted income will inevitably have lower tax rates.

(5) Whether rent reduction has been carried out. Because the tenancy income has changed after rent reduction, which is equivalent to relatively adjusting the progressive rate of both parties. Moreover, according to the provisions of Article 18 of the Provisional Regulations, the tax payment methods for both tenants and landlords are different before and after rent reduction. For example, after rent reduction, "both parties calculate and bear the burden according to their respective incomes." Before rent reduction, "the tenant's income part is levied at a tax rate of 9 percent, which is also paid by the landlord," which will also affect the average tax rate in various regions.

Undoubtedly, some comrades (especially comrades in affluent areas) will initially disagree with allocating tasks with reference to the above situation. They may think that it is "not in line with the policy" for the local total task to exceed 13 percent, so they "lack confidence." This requires the leading organs to first conduct some typical trial calculations in several types of areas, find out various laws, and use facts to convince cadres. For example, the original allocation task of Jinggang District, Changsha County, Hunan Province, was 7 million catties, and the township cadres all said: "Too heavy" and "exceeding the policy." After typical trial calculations, it was much lower than "levying based on rate," and the cadres all said "it's clear."

In some areas, in order to enhance the enthusiasm of farmers to oppose hidden fields, the task is first arranged to the village before conducting investigation and evaluation, and it is announced to the masses that "after the hidden fields are exposed, the burden will not be increased." In this way, the "enthusiasm" for opposing hidden fields is "enhanced," but the contradiction between the tax rate and the task will be further increased, and the burden balance between regions will be affected. It is still necessary to follow the provisions of Article 17 of the Provisional Regulations: "Carry out investigation and evaluation," and according to the various provisions of the regulations: "Calculate the amount of tax payable by each household, fill in the agricultural tax register, and submit it to the county (city) people's government for verification."

II. "Levy Based on Rate"? Or "Class-Based" Tax Calculation?

The general tax rate for various classes in rural areas this year is about 8 percent for poor peasants, about 13 percent for middle peasants, about 20 percent for rich peasants, and about 30 percent for landlords, with a maximum of no more than 50 percent, and no more than 80 percent for special households. This provision is our basic policy on the burden on various classes in rural areas in the newly liberated areas. It is specifically manifested in the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in the Newly Liberated Areas," which is the tax rate table (Article 12 of the Regulations) formulated based on the average annual agricultural income per capita of various classes in rural areas in the newly liberated areas. For example, the average income of middle peasants in general in the newly liberated areas of our country is at the level of 551 catties to 610 catties, so the tax rate at this level is 13 percent. Levy based on progressive average income will generally be consistent with the general tax rate of various classes. However, due to the complex economic situation in our country, the amount of income of the same class often varies from place to place, and even in the same region, the income of the same class is not consistent. Therefore, it cannot be completely consistent with the general tax rate of various classes. For example, trial calculations in six villages in richer areas of Hubei and Jiangxi show that poor peasants bear 10 to 20 percent, middle peasants bear 20 to 30 percent, and rich peasants bear 30 to 40 percent. In some areas of Shandong, the average income of middle peasants is between 300 catties and 500 catties, so middle peasants in this type of area should only bear 6 to 11 percent. In special cases, such as Sun Yicheng, a middle peasant in Qiuzhuang Village, Qihe County, Shandong Province, there are only two people in the whole household, and the average income per person is 1,620 catties. "Levying based on rate" accounts for 27 percent of the income. This is an inevitable phenomenon of "levying based on rate," and it is also permitted by the policy. Some comrades encounter this situation and think that it is "a violation of the policy" and that "class-based taxation" is more reasonable; or they advocate levying progressively based on income, and reducing those who exceed the tax rate of their class; or they advocate "levying based on rate" for landlords and rich peasants, while middle peasants and poor peasants are taxed according to "class burden." However, facts have proved that the "class-based collection" method or "partial class-based collection" method adopted in some areas last year did not work, but instead caused a series of unreasonable phenomena and caused confusion in rural areas. For example, some areas classify most of the poorer middle peasants and some middle peasants as poor peasants, and levy taxes according to the tax rate of poor peasants. The task of the whole village cannot be completed, so the wealthy middle peasants and individual middle peasants are promoted to rich peasants. Among the eight "rich peasant" households divided in the second administrative village of the second district of Yiyang County, Jiangxi Province, six households were promoted in this way. Of course, "levying progressively based on the average agricultural income per capita by agricultural population" should also try to distinguish the different natures of agricultural income of various classes. However, Article 15 of the Provisional Regulations has already taken care of this point. According to the conversion calculation in that article, although various classes have the same amount of income, there are already differences in tax rates. For example, those who employ labor to operate and have an average income of 1,400 catties per person (rich peasants) bear 25 percent (tax rate level 23), while those who lease out income of 1,400 catties (landlords) should bear 27 percent (level 25); comparing poor peasants and middle peasants again, those who have tenanted income of 360 catties (poor peasants) bear 6 percent (level 4), while those who have self-cultivated income of 360 catties (relatively poor middle peasants) should bear 8 percent (level 6). However, the income of various classes in rural areas is intricate and complex. It is impossible and should not be required to completely separate the burden ratio of various classes.

III. The Tax Rate Problem of Each Taxpayer

A survey of 48 typical households in four villages in Qihe County, Shandong Province, during the wheat tax collection this year showed that the actual burden rate (the ratio of the burden to the actual income of the year) of 32 households exceeded the due burden rate (the ratio of the burden to the normal income), while the other 16 households were lower than the due burden rate. These are all the results of evaluating yields and "levying based on rate." Some comrades feel: "Why does no household comply with the policy when levying based on rate?" According to: The tax rate table is of course a concentrated expression of the burden policy, but the tax rate table and other articles are interrelated. We can roughly find several reasons for this phenomenon from the following related articles:

(1) Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations stipulates: "The calculation of agricultural income shall be based on the normal yield of the land"; Article 7 stipulates: "If the harvest of the same land exceeds the normal yield due to diligent cultivation, good management, or planting economic crops, it shall still be calculated according to the normal yield." Therefore, the "actual tax rate" of this type of household should be lower than the "due tax rate" when "levying based on rate"; conversely, if "the harvest is less than the normal yield due to laziness in cultivation," then it shall also be calculated according to the normal yield," then the "actual tax rate" of this type of household should exceed the "due tax rate."

(2) The Shandong summer tax collection method stipulates: "Those who suffer from disasters less than 30 percent will not be reduced, those who suffer from 30 to 40 percent will be reduced by 30 percent..." Although one village in the four villages suffered a slight disaster and poor harvest, it did not reach the level of reduction or exemption, so the "actual tax rate" of the households with slight disasters would exceed the "due tax rate."

(3) Households that cultivate wasteland are exempt from agricultural tax within the prescribed period according to Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations. Therefore, during the exemption period, the "actual tax rate" of this type of household is lower than the "due tax rate."

(4) Article 8 stipulates that "for those who raise the normal yield by repairing water conservancy or improving the land by other methods," "the normal yield shall not be revised" within a certain period. Therefore, the "actual tax rate" of this type of household will be lower than the "due tax rate."

(5) Article 22 stipulates: "The local surcharge of agricultural tax shall not exceed 15 percent of the regular tax and shall be collected together with the agricultural tax." After the regular tax is "levied based on rate," plus the local grain, the proportion of the total amount of tax (public grain plus local grain) paid by the taxpayer to income should generally exceed the "due tax rate."

The aforementioned five situations, which cause the "actual tax rate" of the taxpayer to be higher or lower than the "due tax rate," are precisely prescribed within the scope of the policy. As for some areas where the normal yield is evaluated too low or too high, which actually reduces or increases the tax rate, it is naturally unreasonable. Therefore, the prerequisite for truly "levying based on rate" actually lies in whether the evaluation of land yield is true.

　　关于新区农业税“依率计征”的认识
    易之
    整风以来，农业税收工作同志对政策与任务的一致性，理论上已经有了进一步的认识。但是如何做到上述二者的一致，显然还是目前急待解决的问题，特别秋征已经开始，有些同志对如何才算符合税率一点，还认识不足，这对于政策的贯彻是有影响的。为正确解决这一问题，特提出新解放区农业税税率执行中几个具体问题，和各地同志研究。
    一、税率与任务的“矛盾”
    税率与任务本来是一致的，只因在执行中间发生偏差，所以就有了矛盾。偏差产生的原因，一方面由于没有掌握确实的人口、土地和产量的数字，以致造成上下数字脱节，使征收缺乏可靠的依据；另一方面，主要在分配任务中，没有参照各地的经济情况，今年新解放区国家公粮总额依政务院指示：“由去年百分之十七，减至今年百分之十三”，有些同志误认为这一比例在每一地区（甚至县、村）都要适合，因此在分配各地秋征税额时，就不管各地经济情况如何，统一按百分之十三平均摊派，以致在富的或土地集中的地区，以户为单位“依率计征”以后，就大大超过上级所分配的应征粮额，而在贫穷的、土地分散的地区则不能完成任务。前者如湖南二县三村、江西三县三村统计，“依率计征”以后，平均负担占收入百分之十五至百分之二十，超过原分配任务（即依百分之十三分配）百分之十五至百分之五十五；江西南昌专区省原分配任务二·七亿，“依率计征”以后，实际可完成四·五亿；特富地区可超过原分配任务百分之六六，如新淦县每人平均产谷约一千斤左右，平均税率可达百分之二十二至百分之二十三。后者如苏北，有些村庄原按百分之十三分配，实际依率计征仅能征收百分之七至百分之八。这样在富的地区，干部便会产生乐观思想，误认为“今年任务好完成”，“完成原定任务即可”，穷区干部则表示“信心不足”，“完不成任务”。目前的问题，在政策与任务已发生“矛盾”的地区，应该设法适当地消除这种“矛盾”，在尚未发生这种“矛盾”的地区，为如何防止其发生。
    在解决前一问题时，有些超过任务的地区，主张减低税率，缩小负担面，减少耕地或产量，甚至要重复采用机械划阶级派负担的办法；有些任务不能完成的地区，则采用强迫命令，提出“边评边送”“先征粮后调整”的口号，或强迫群众挑战，或根本平均分摊，或依靠少数积极分子带头报高产量，勉求完成任务。这些办法都是错误的，行不通的，必须迅速纠正。主要的应说服干部与群众，依率酌予调整。这就须要①教育干部，认真研究税法与合理负担的政策，学会计算税率的办法，俾能真正按政策办事；②深入了解情况，充分掌握材料，使负担能照顾农村实况；③向群众说明税法，说明原则，并发动群众提出办法，只有这样，才能纠正畸轻畸重的现象。
    在尚未发生这种“矛盾”的地区，除掌握精确的土地亩数产量和人口数字以外，还应参照下述情况，正确分配任务。
    （１）地区贫富和土地集中或分散的情况，这是主要的因素。因为新解放区的农业税是“以户为单位按农业人口每人平均农业收入累进计征”的。富裕的、土地集中的地区，纳税户要负担较高的累进率，贫穷的、土地分散的地区，纳税户的累进率则较低。故就个别地区来说，当地的总负担超过或不及其农业总收入的百分之十三，是为政策所许可的。惟一般所谓土地集中或分散，是就土地所有权来说的，而农业税则是按收益计征，故在掌握上述情况时，不仅要看到土地所有权的集中与分散，还必须参照土地的使用状况。
    （２）“税税户的土地，分散在外省（市）外县（市）者”，或本地土地之纳税户住在外省（市）外县（市）者，前者江南人多称“遥庄地”，后者多称“寄庄地”或“客田”。暂行条例第十四条对于这两种土地分别规定了不同的计征办法，去年湖南省常德县清平乡第四保试算该保总产量时，其中有百分之二十是外保占有的，该类收入如在本保计征，全保可征收百分之二五·七，如不在本保计征，仅征百分之一五·八；有些地区该类收入特多者，差别会更大，如湖南长沙县黎圫乡今秋试算，全保该类收入负担八一三、八七○斤，占全保总负担百分之七八。
    （３）对于祠堂、会社、学校……等社团的土地，其“农业收入不能以人口平均计算者”，暂行条例第十三条曾规定了固定的负担比例，该类土地据湖南安化、益阳、宁乡等五县八村调查，占总耕地百分之一五·三，对当地平均税率的影响，是会很大的。
    （４）租佃情况，因暂行条例第十五条规定：“出租地的收入……每一百斤作一百二十斤计算，”“佃耕地的收入……每一百斤作八十斤计算。”出租收入较多地区，税率必较高，佃耕收入较多地区，税率则必较低。
    （５）是否已经进行减租。因减租后租佃收入已起变化，等于相对调整了双方的累进率。且依暂行条例第十八条的规定，减租前后租佃双方的纳税办法各不相同，如减租后“双方按各自收入计算负担”减租前“佃户收入部分，按百分之九的税率计征，亦由业主交纳，”也会影响各地的平均税率的。
    参照上述情况分配任务，无疑有些同志（特别是富庶地区的同志）开始会不同意，他们也许认为当地总任务超过百分之十三是“不合政策”的，所以“没有信心”。这就要求领导机关最好先分几个类型地区，做些典型试算，找出各种规律，用事实说服干部。如湖南长沙县靖港区原先分配任务七百万斤，乡干部都说：“太重”、“超过政策”，经过典型试算以后，比“依率计征”还低得多，干部们才都说“通了”。
    有些地区为了提高农民反黑田的情绪，先把任务布置到村后，才进行调查评议，并向群众宣布“反出黑田以后，不增加负担，”这样反黑田的“情绪”是“提高”了，但税率和任务的矛盾，会更加增大，且影响地区之间的负担平衡。仍须依暂行条例十七条的规定：“进行调查评议”，并根据该条例的各项规定：“计算各户应交税额，填造农业税清册，报送县（市）人民政府核定之。”
    二、“依率计征”？还是“划阶级”计税？
    今年农村各阶层的一般税率贫农为百分之八左右，中农百分之十三左右，富农百分之二十左右，地主百分之三十左右，最高不超过百分之五十，特殊户亦不超过百分之八十，这一规定，是我们对待新解放区农村各阶层负担上的基本政策，在“新解放区农业税暂行条例”中具体表现出来，就是根据新解放区农村各阶层每人每年一般平均农业收入多少拟订的税率表（条例第十二条）。如我国新解放区一般中农平均收入为五五一斤至六一○斤这一级，因此这一级的税率就是百分之一三。按平均收入累进计征，一般地区是会与各阶层一般税率符合的。但因我国经济情况复杂，同一阶层收入的多少往往因地而异，甚至在同一地区同一阶层的收入也并不一致，因此与各阶层的一般税率就不能完全吻合。如湖北、江西较富地区六个村试算：贫农负担百分之一○至二○，中农百分之二○至三○，富农百分之三○至四○；而山东有些地区中农平均收入在三○○斤至五○○斤之间，故该类地区中农只应负担百分之六至百分之十一；特殊情况如该省齐河县邱庄村有中农名孙义成者，全户只有二人，每人平均收入一六二○斤，“依率计征”，负担占收入百分之二七。这是“依率计征”所不可避免的现象，同时也是政策所许可的。有些同志碰到这种情况，认为“违反政策”不如“划阶级征税”合理；或者主张按收入累进计征，超过其阶层税率者，予以降低；或者主张地主富农“依率计征”，中农、贫农则按“阶级负担”；但事实证明，去年部分地区所采用“划阶级征收”办法，或“部分划阶级征收”办法，都没行通，反使不合理的现象迭出，引起农村混乱。例如有些地区将大部苦一些的中农和部分中农划为贫农，依贫农税率计征，全村任务不能完成，就将富裕中农和个别中农提高为富农。江西弋阳县第二区第二行政村划的八户“富农”中间，有六户就是这样提高的。当然，“依农业人口每人平均农业收入累进计征”，也应尽力区别各阶层不同性质的农业收入，但是这一点暂行条例的第十五条已经照顾到了。照该条折合计算，各阶层虽收入数量相同，但在税率上已有区别，如雇工经营每人平均收入一四○○斤者（富农）负担百分之二五（税率二三级），出租收入一四○○斤者（地主），即应负担百分之二七（二五级）；再拿贫农和中农比较，佃耕收入三六○斤者（贫农），负担百分之六（第四级），自耕收入三六○斤者（比较苦的中农）即应负担百分之八（第六级）。但农村各阶层的收入是错综复杂的，要求各阶层的负担比例绝然分开，是不可能，同时也是不应该的。
    三、各纳税户的税率问题
    今年麦征中间山东齐河县四个村四十八个典型户的调查，其中有三十二户的实际负担率（负担占当年实际收入的比例），超过应计负担率（负担占常年收入的比例），其它十六户则低于应计负担率。这都是评好了产量“依率计征”的结果。有些同志就感觉：“为什么依率计征一户也不符合政策？”按：税率表当然是负担政策的集中表现，但税率表与其它条文都是相互关联的。我们从下述有关的条文大体可找出发生这一现象的几种原因：
    （１）暂行条例第六条规定：“农业收入的计算以土地的常年应产量为标准”；第七条规定：“同等土地因勤劳耕作或善于经营或种植经济作物，其收获量超过常年应产量者，仍按常年应产量计算。”因此，该类户“依率计征”，“实际税率”应低于“应计税率”；反之，若“怠于耕作，其收获量不及常年应产量者，亦照常年应产量计算，”则该类户“实际税率”应超过“应计税率”。
    （２）山东夏征办法规定：“受灾三成以下者，不减，三成至四成者，减三成……”，四村中，虽有一村轻灾歉收，然未及减免程度，故轻灾户的“实际税率”，是会超过“应计税率”的。
    （３）垦种荒地的户，依暂行条例第五条：“在规定期间内，免纳农业税。”故免纳期间，该类户的“实际税率”，低于“应计税率”。
    （４）第八条对“凡因兴修水利或以其它方法改良土地而提高常年应产量者”，在一定期间以内，“常年应产量不改订”。故该类户“实际税率”将低于“应计税率”。
    （５）第二十二条规定：“农业税地方附加，不得超过正税的百分之十五，随同农业税附征之。”正税“依率计征”以后，外加地方粮，纳税户的纳税总额（公粮加地方粮），占收入的比例，一般应超过“应计税率”。
    前述五种情况，使纳税户的“实际税率”高于或低于“应计税率”，正是政策范围以内所规定的。至若有些地区将常年产量评议过低或过高，实际就是降低或提高了税率，自然是不合理的。故真正“依率计征”的先决条件，实系于土地产量评议是否真实。
