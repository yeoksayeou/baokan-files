　　Minister of Soviet Cinema
    Bolshakov on Soviet Cinema
    ——Moscow Visit Notes V
    Liu Baiyu
    Bolshakov is the highest leader of Soviet film art. My diary records our meeting with him on July 25th:
    "We went up to the Film Department building, along the long corridor, and into the Film Department Minister's reception room. Bolshakov came out from the side door connecting to the office - a man nearing fifty, slightly plump, wearing glasses. His firm handshake makes you feel sincere sincerity and love.
    "This is a huge room.
    "Under the window, Bolshakov sat in the high-backed chair behind his huge oak desk. We were right in front of the table, a circle of red velvet sofas around a round table. At one end of the desk sat Timin, head of the Soviet Film Export Company. Under the window sat Tashtelin, director of the Moscow Documentary Film Studio."
    Generally speaking, this was a rare visit, because before us, about to answer our questions, was not just an artist, but a minister of the Soviet government. I was able to get this opportunity because I participated in the first cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in artistic work - the production of the five-color film "The Victory of the Chinese People." We were invited to meet when our compilation work was nearing completion.
    Now, please allow me a moment of reflection: At the end of May, the mountain peaks around Lake Baikal were still glittering with white snow. At night, our train pulled into the station of the Siberian capital, a grand and beautiful station, lights and music, the station building was crowded with people - it was here that I found countless waiting passengers enjoying movies. On the walls of Moscow streets, countless movie posters were posted. The Midoropol Cinema I frequented, was full every time, whether in the Red Hall or the Green Hall. A student from a Soviet industrial university told me: Soviet youth do not miss a single movie. In factories, collective farms, barracks, and even in open harvested fields, movies are shown everywhere. According to my observation, film in the Soviet Union is the most widespread and in-depth social education. The beginning of this cause dates back to 1919, when Lenin signed the famous decree on transferring films to the management of the People's Commissariat for Education. Stalin often personally nurtured this cause, believing that "film is the greatest means of mobilizing the masses." In thirty years, this youngest art department has not only achieved tremendous development, but has also created very brilliant and valuable results in the world's people's art.
    Bolshakov first asked with concern about our work in Moscow. Later, we talked about the situation of Soviet films in China. I told him that our Film Bureau plans to translate eighty-four Soviet films this year. He also told us that Moscow would soon be showing the first Chinese film, "Daughters of China." He also asked in detail about the situation of Chinese film equipment and organization. At this time, he said:
    "Lenin said that film is the most important department of art."
    When we asked him to give suggestions for the new Chinese people's film cause, he began his talk like this:
    "Soviet film has a history of thirty years. The initial period - before 1931 was the silent film period. At that time, film art was deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology. However, the struggle between socialist ideology and bourgeois ideology began. In the struggle, socialist realism was produced - its task is to truly reflect Soviet reality, in line with party spirit and historical truth. In this stage, a major turning point was 'Chapayev'. This is the initial representative work of socialist realism. At this time, sound films were also produced. Before 1938, all major cities in the Soviet Union, such as Odessa, Kiev, and Leningrad, had film factories, but there was no overall leadership. In 1938, the Film Committee was established, unifying the national film industry. During the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union, some areas were occupied by German invaders. Many film workers, such as directors and actors, went to the front lines to fight. As a result, the scope of film work narrowed. After the war, some directors and screenwriters, influenced by bourgeois ideology, had a wrong understanding of film art creation. They thought that the people were tired after the war and needed entertainment, so they should produce some light, thoughtless entertainment films. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party made a resolution on "Great Life", criticizing this error and giving the Soviet film artists a new direction. Soviet films should reflect the Soviet reality, the post-war recovery and construction, and the advance from socialism to communism."
    Bolshakov briefly summarized the thirty years of Soviet film experience, and then he turned to talk about today:
    "The new directions of Soviet film at present:
    "The first is films that profoundly express the Soviet reality, such as 'Rural Teacher', 'Siberian Symphony', and the recently made 'Kuban Cossacks'.
    "The second is films that express the struggle to defend world peace. These films mercilessly expose the conspiracies of the world's war instigators, such as 'The Russian Question', 'Meeting on the Elbe', and 'The Unveiled Conspiracy'.
    "The third is films that depict great historical events and figures, namely 'The Great Battle of Stalingrad', 'The Third Blow', and 'The Fall of Berlin'." At this time, he emphasized that these films "have made great progress in ideology and art compared to the past. This is a new expression method, a new style, artistic documentaries that did not exist before the war. After these films received excellent evaluations from the audience, they should be greatly developed.
    "The fourth is scientific and educational art films, using great scientists as film subjects, such as the great Russian botanist Michurin, the biologist Pavlov, the scientist Zhukov who first invented the airplane... This is also a new style in Soviet film, and it also has great development prospects. The Soviet Union uses these films to introduce the achievements of great scientists, which has become a new method of educating young people. Young people who study science can only hear lectures in the classroom, but from the films, they can specifically see the characters' creation and actions. This kind of film guides Soviet youth to generate a wide interest in science and conduct research on science.
    "The Soviet Union also pays attention to making popular science educational short films. Four film studios specialize in making these educational short films. For example, a short film is used to teach people how to use a tractor - a set of films that can be played for twenty-six hours, which can be shown in segments. The content includes everything from the structure of the tractor to how to drive it. The Soviet Union adopted film education methods and taught hundreds of thousands of people to drive tractors. At present, universities and middle schools try their best to use films to cooperate with classroom lectures. Medical students learn how to perform head surgery from a film.
    "Finally, regarding news documentary shorts, there are fifteen documentary film studios in the Soviet Union, producing more than two hundred documentary shorts every year."
    At this time, I asked him about the construction of the Soviet film industry. He said:
    "All nationalities and union republics in the Soviet Union have their own film factories, using their own national languages and their own actors to make films. This is a concrete combination of socialist content and national form. Some of these films are translated into Russian, and Russian films are also translated into the languages of all nationalities." At this time, he thanked me with a smile for telling him about China's work in translating Soviet films, and he said, "Therefore, we are very experienced in dubbing films."
    Regarding the issue of training cadres, he said: "We have specialized schools for training film cadres. The Moscow Film University specializes in training creative cadres, and the Leningrad and Kiev Film Universities specialize in training technical cadres."
    Bolshakov talked about actors.
    "Our film actors are separate from stage actors. There is a 'Film Actors' House' - with more than two hundred of the best film actors." At this time, he listed the names of actors such as Makarova.
    The Soviet Film Department has specialized factories to manufacture film and machines. As for mobile projection teams, the projectors are installed on cars, so they can drive all the way to the harvested fields and show movies during the farmers' rest time. After finishing watching at one farm, they immediately drive to another farm.
    My second question to him was about the Soviet Union's evaluation of the new artistic characteristics of the films that won the Stalin Prize in 1949 - such as "The Fall of Berlin."
    He immediately replied happily: " 'The Fall of Berlin' belongs to artistic documentaries.
    "Director Chiaureli and screenwriter Pavlenko spent two years studying all the materials related to the war in detail and creating the script. All the war scenes in the film were shot at the real original places. Thus, the shooting work went from Moscow to Stalingrad to Berlin. In addition to showing the process of historical events, this film also created two protagonists (steel worker Ivanov and female teacher Natasha) to develop the theme. All the film actors were selected from the best actors - only Shavileshev played Hitler for the first time, but he achieved great success. Actors who played Hitler in the past only caricatured Hitler, but Shavileshev truly studied the diaries of Hitler's confidants that were seized during the war - studied Hitler's last life and the situation between him and his mistress Eva Braun. In this way, Shavileshev truly portrayed Hitler very realistically.
    "This film took two years to write the script and one year to shoot."
    In order to supplement the understanding of the new artistic characteristics of Soviet films, I am recording here the Literary Gazette's review of "The Fall of Berlin": "After 'The Fall of Berlin' was shown nationwide, it received extremely high evaluations from the Soviet people. The audience loved to watch this film very much. The Literary Gazette published a lengthy review for this purpose, giving it a high evaluation from content to form. It was believed that the director and author handled it very vividly not only in ideology but also in individual shots. It was also specially pointed out that the natural lighting greatly helped the film. Glovania (Soviet People's Artist) has played Stalin many times, and this time he played it best in 'The Fall of Berlin'. The entire Soviet literature and art are striving to reflect new and forward-looking things from reality and point out a path of development for the people, which has achieved the greatest success in this film. Ivanov is one of the thousands of ordinary workers in the Soviet Union. He has demonstrated the heroism of the Soviet people both in peacetime and in wartime. This has created a model for the people."
    Bolshakov, without waiting for us to ask, talked about the important factors that determine a film besides the director:
    "The film script determines the quality of the film, so we should put the screenwriter's name at the very front. Under the direct leadership of the Soviet Film Department, there is a film script factory - which has absorbed the best writers in the Soviet Union to participate in the creation of scripts, such as Simonov, Pavlenko, and Tikhonov. Also, Soviet poet Surkov often writes explanatory texts for documentaries.
    "It also depends on good actors.
    "Third, it depends on good photographers - that is, not those who are like machines, who shoot whatever they are told to shoot, but who know what should be shot and shoot it as beautifully as a painting, expressing it vividly and realistically.
    "Music is also very important to film. Therefore, the Soviet Union has the best musicians, such as Shostakovich who composed the music for 'The Fall of Berlin', and Khachaturian who composed the music for 'The Great Battle of Stalingrad'.
    We originally anticipated that this meeting might only be a few minutes to a dozen minutes, but we had already talked for more than an hour. However, Bolshakov continued to cross his hands on the desk, leaned his upper body forward, and looked at us kindly, saying:
    "Please tell the Chinese Film Bureau that if there are any difficulties and needs in developing the new Chinese people's film cause, we will definitely help as much as possible."
    I thanked him. He stood up. He finally said earnestly:
    "Moscow filmmakers are very eager to meet with you."
    He invited us - on Saturday, to hold a special gathering of the film art community at the Moscow Film Club. As a result, it was an extremely grand and warm get-together for Chinese and Soviet literary and artistic workers. From Film Department Minister Bolshakov to every Soviet filmmaker, whether in conversation or at the gathering, was filled with infinite enthusiasm for China. Therefore, it was a pleasant Moscow Saturday that let me remember that storm-like joyful sounds, conversations, music, and countless times - raising glasses for a happy future. That gathering lasted from dusk on the first day until dawn on the second day. Time seems to be able to explain everything, but here the most important thing is to explain the forever unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples.

　　苏联电影事业部部长
    波尔沙科夫谈苏联电影
    ——莫斯科访问记之五
    刘白羽
    波尔沙科夫是苏联电影艺术的最高领导者。在我的日记上记载着七月二十五日我们与他会见的情形：
    “我们走上电影部大楼，顺着长长的走廊，进入电影部部长的会客室。波尔沙科夫从与办公室相通的侧门走出来，——将近五十岁的人，微胖，带着一付眼镜。他那紧紧的握手，让你感到衷心的诚意与热爱。
    “这是一间巨大的房屋。
    “窗下，波尔沙科夫坐在他那巨大橡木办公桌后的高背椅上。我们就在桌前，一圈红天鹅绒沙发围着一只圆桌。在办公桌的一端坐着苏联电影总输出公司负责人季明。窗下坐着莫斯科文献制片厂厂长塔斯铁林。”
    一般说来，这是一个难得的访问，因为在我们面前，将要回答我们问题的，不只是一个艺术家，而是一个苏联政府的部长。我能得到这个访问的机会，是因为我参加中国与苏联在艺术工作上第一度合作，——拍制五彩电影片《中国人民的胜利》的缘故。我们被邀会见，正在我们的编制工作将近完成的时候。
    现在，请允许我做片刻的回想：五月末，贝加尔湖周围的山顶上还闪着白雪。夜间，我们的列车开进西伯利亚首府的车站，宏大而美丽的车站，灯光与音乐，站房内挤满人，——就在这里，我发现无数候车者在欣赏着电影。莫斯科街头墙壁上，贴着无数电影海报。我常去的米多罗波尔电影院，无论红厅、绿厅每次满座。一个苏联工业大学的学生告诉我：苏联青年是没有一部电影不看的。在工厂、集体农庄、军营里，甚至在露天的收获的田野上，到处都有电影放映。根据我的观察，电影在苏联是一种最广泛、最深入的社会教育。这一事业的开端，远在一九一九年，列宁签署了关于电影移交教育人民委员会管理的、有名的法令。斯大林经常亲手扶育着这个事业，他认为“电影是鼓动群众最伟大的手段”。三十年间，这一最年轻的艺术部门不但得到巨大的发展，而且已经创造了世界人民艺术当中非常辉煌与宝贵的成果。
    波尔沙科夫首先关切地问到我们在莫斯科的工作。后来，我们谈到苏联电影在中国的情形，我告诉他，今年我们电影局有翻译八十四部苏联影片的计划。他也告诉我们，莫斯科最近将演出第一部中国电影《中华女儿》。他又详细的问到中国电影设备与组织情况。这时，他说：
    “列宁说过，电影是艺术中最重要的一个部门。”
    当我们提出，希望他能对中国新的人民电影事业给以建议时，他这样开始他的谈话：
    “苏联电影有了三十年历史，最初一个时期，——一九三一年以前是默片时期，那时电影艺术很深的受着资产阶级思想意识影响，但是，开始了社会主义思想意识与资产阶级思想意识的斗争，在斗争之中，产生了社会主义现实主义，——它的任务是真正反映苏联现实、合乎党性与历史真实性。在这一个阶段里，一个大的转折点是“夏伯阳”，这是社会主义现实主义最初的代表作，在这时候，也就产生了有声影片。一九三八年以前，全苏联各主要城市如奥德萨、基辅、列宁格勒都有电影厂，但是没有总的领导，到一九三八年成立了电影委员会，统一了全国的电影事业。在苏联伟大的卫国战争中，开始一部分地区被德寇占领，很多电影工作者，如导演、演员们，到前线去作战去了，这样一来，电影的工作范围就缩小了。战争之后，有些导演和剧作家，受了资产阶级思想意识的影响，对于电影艺术创造上，有了一种错误的了解。他们以为人民经过战争的疲劳，需要娱乐，因此应该制作一些轻松的、没有思想的娱乐影片。联共中央做了关于“伟大生活”的决议，批判了这一种错误，给苏维埃电影艺术工作者以新的路线。苏联电影应当反映苏维埃现实生活，战后的恢复建设，从社会主义向共产主义道路的迈进。”
    波尔沙科夫简括地总结了苏联电影三十年的经验，然后，他转而谈到今天：
    “目前苏联电影新的方向：
    “第一种是深刻地表现了苏联现实生活的影片，如《乡村女教师》《西伯利亚交响乐》以及最近制成的《库班哥萨克》。
    “第二种是表现保卫世界和平斗争的影片，这种影片，无情地揭露了世界战争挑拨者的阴谋，像《俄罗斯问题》，《易北河会师》《被揭露的阴谋》。
    “第三种是表现历史伟大事件和人物的，那就是《斯大林格勒大血战》《第三次打击》和《攻克柏林》。”这时他着重地指出这一种影片“在思想、艺术上比从前都获得很大的进步，这是一种新的表现方法，新的风格，在战争以前没有的艺术性的纪录片，这种影片得到观众极好的评价以后，应当得到大量的发展。
    “第四种是科学教育的艺术片，以伟大科学家为电影题材，如像俄罗斯伟大植物学家米丘林，生物学家巴甫洛夫，第一个发明飞机的科学家茹科夫，……这也是苏联电影中一种新的风格，也有很大发展前途。苏联用这些片子介绍伟大科学家的成就，这成为一种教育青年的新的方法。学习科学的青年们在课堂上只能听到讲演，从电影上则可以具体看到人物的创造与行动，这种电影，引导苏联青年对科学产生了广泛的兴趣，而进行对于科学的钻研。
    “苏联同时也注意拍制科学普及的教育短片，有四个电影厂专门制造这种教育短片。比如用一部短片，来教会人们使用拖拉机，——一套可演二十六个钟点的片子，可以分段放映，其内容方面，包括从拖拉机的构造一直到怎样驾驶。苏联采用电影教育方法，教会几十万人开拖拉机。目前，大学、中学、都尽量采用电影配合课堂讲授，医科大学的学生从一部片子里学会如何进行头部开刀手术。
    “最后，关于新闻纪录短片，全苏联有十五个文献制片厂，每年制做二百部以上纪录短片。”
    这时，我向他提问关于苏联电影事业建设情况。他说：
    “苏联各民族、各加盟国都有自己的电影厂，用自己民族的语言，用自己的演员，制成影片。这是社会主义内容与民族形式的具体结合。这种影片有的还要译成俄文，同时，俄文片也译成各民族的语言。”这时，他以微笑来答谢我刚才告他中国翻译苏联影片的工作，他说：“因此，我们对翻版片是很有经验的。”
    关于培养干部问题，他说：“我们设有专门培养电影干部的学校，莫斯科电影大学专门培养创作的干部，列宁格勒与基辅的电影大学则专门培养技术的干部。”
    波尔沙科夫谈到演员。
    “我们的电影演员与舞台演员分开，设有‘电影演员之家’——有二百多最好的电影演员。”这时，他列举了马卡洛娃等演员的名字。
    苏联电影部下，设有专门工厂制造胶片和机器。至于流动放映队，放映机装设在汽车上，这样，他们就可以一直开到收割的田野上，利用农民们休息时间放演电影，这一处农庄看完，他们马上又开到别的农庄上去。
    我问他第二个问题是苏联对于一九四九年荣获斯大林奖金的影片，——如《攻克柏林》的新的艺术特点的估价。
    他立刻愉快地回答我：“《攻克柏林》属于艺术性的纪录片。
    “导演齐乌列里和剧作家巴甫连柯，花费了两年时间，详细地研究了所有有关战争的材料，创作剧本。影片中所有战争的场面都是到真实的原地方去拍的，这样，拍制工作从莫斯科到斯大林格勒，到柏林。这部电影除表现历史事件过程之外，还创造了两个主角（炼钢工人伊万诺夫和女教师娜塔莎）来发展主题。全部电影演员，都挑选了最好的演员，——只有沙维利斯夫是第一次饰演希特勒，但他获得巨大成功。从前饰演希特勒的演员只是把希特勒漫画化了，而沙维利斯夫真正研究了在战争中缴获到的，希特勒的亲信的日记，——研究了希特勒最后的生活，以及他和他的情妇叶娃·布朗的情形，这样，沙维利斯夫就把希特勒真正表演得很真实了。
    “这部电影，剧本写了两年，拍制了一年。”
    为了补充对于苏联电影新的艺术特点的理解，我在这里记下《文学报》编辑部关于《攻克柏林》的评论：“《攻克柏林》在全国放映后，得到苏联人民极高的评价，观众们都很爱看这部片子。《文学报》为此发表了大篇的评论，从内容到形式，予以很高的评价。认为导演与作者，不但在思想上，而且在个别镜头上都处理得非常生动。还特别提出灯光的自然，对片子给了很大帮助。格洛瓦尼（苏联人民艺员）多次饰演斯大林，而这一次在《攻克柏林》中演得最好。整个苏联文学艺术，都争取如何从现实当中反映新的、前进的东西，为人民指出一条发展的道路，这在这一部影片中获得最大成功。伊万诺夫是苏联千千万万普通工人中的一个人，他无论在平时、在战时，都表现了苏联人民的英雄主义，这对人民来说是创造了一个典范。”
    波尔沙科夫没等我们提问，就谈到除了导演之外决定一部电影的重要因素：
    “电影剧本决定着电影的好坏，所以我们应该把剧作者的名字放在最前面。在苏联电影事业部直接领导之下，设有电影剧本厂，——这里面吸收了苏联最优秀的作家，参加创作剧本，如像西蒙诺夫、巴甫连柯、吉洪诺夫。还有，像苏联诗人苏尔科夫也经常为纪录片写说明辞。
    “还决定于好的演员。
    “第三、决定于好的摄影师，——就是说不是那些像机器一样，叫拍什么就拍什么的人，而是自己知道应该拍什么，拍出来应该像一幅画一样美丽，表现得生动而真实。
    “音乐对电影也是十分重要的，因此，苏联有最好的音乐家，如像萧斯塔科维支就为《攻克柏林》创作音乐，哈恰吐梁也为《斯大林格勒大血战》作曲。
    我们原来预想，这次会面，也许只能是几分钟到十几分钟的事情，但是，我们已经谈过一小时以上了。可是，波尔沙科夫还继续把两只手交叉地搁在办公桌上，他向前倾着上身，亲切的望着我们说：
    “请你们转告中国电影局，在发展新的中国人民电影事业上，如果有什么困难和需要，我们一定尽量帮助。”
    我向他致谢。他站起来，他最后恳切地说：
    “莫斯科的电影工作者都很想和你们会面。”
    他约请我们——星期六，在莫斯科的电影俱乐部举行一次专门的电影艺术界的集会。结果那是一次极为盛大而热烈的中国与苏联文学艺术工作者的联欢。从电影部部长波尔沙科夫到每一个苏联电影工作者，无论在谈话中无论在集会上，都是充溢着无限的，对于中国的热情。因此，那是一个愉快的莫斯科的星期六，让我记着那暴风雨一样的欢欣的声音，谈话，音乐与无数次的——为了未来幸福而举杯。那个集会，从头一天的黄昏一直到第二天的天明。时间似乎可以说明一切，但，在这里最重要的是说明中国与苏联人民的、永远牢不可破的友谊。
