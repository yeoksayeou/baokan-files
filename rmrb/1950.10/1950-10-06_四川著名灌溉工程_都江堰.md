The famous irrigation project in Sichuan – Dujiangyan
	Jiang Heng

	The Chengdu Plain, a fertile expanse free from waterlogging and drought, owes its status as one of China's wealthiest regions to the renowned Dujiangyan water conservancy project on the upper reaches of the Min River, built with the blood and sweat of countless people. This project, now rebuilt under the leadership of the People's Government, ensures irrigation for three million mu of farmland on the Chengdu Plain and benefits four million people by protecting them from major floods.

	The Creation and Reconstruction of Dujiangyan

	Dujiangyan (also called Du'an Weir, named after the old name of Guan County, Du'an) is a large-scale irrigation project in China, dating back to the Qin Dynasty, about 2,300 years ago. According to historical records and legends in western Sichuan: As early as 250 BC (the first year of King Xiaowen of Qin), Li Bing and his son, the governor of Shu Commandery in Qin, noticed that the downstream of the main stream of the Min River (now the Outer River, on the right) the Mo River (Ya River) caused harm, often flooding; while the inner river (on the left) had poor water flow, resulting in frequent droughts. Therefore, at the main outlet of the Min River in Guan County, where it flows out of the mountains into the Chengdu Plain, they carved the Li Dui (carved through Yulei Mountain, hence the name) and built a large weir to divert water into the inner river, freeing the outer river from floods, while the inner river could provide irrigation. At the same time, water could be drawn during droughts, and water gates could be blocked during floods. This is the greatness of Dujiangyan's function. Because Li Bing and his son, Erlang, did this good deed for the people at the time, they are still worshiped in various parts of Sichuan. But in fact, even history cannot deny that the construction of this vast project mainly relied on the strength of hundreds of millions of people over the generations. According to Fengsu Tongzhi and Shuijing Zhu: "Bing captured the evil dragon, and Zhongzi exterminated the remaining members. The harm was eliminated, and the people were overjoyed, and hundreds of millions of people eagerly obeyed the orders of Bing and his son to dig the pass and build the weir." Also, the Shu Weir Stele by Jie Xisi of the Yuan Dynasty stated: "The number of soldiers and civilians serving ranged from more than ten thousand to less than a thousand." From this, it can be seen that the historical master of the creation of Dujiangyan was the people.

	Since the Republic of China, due to the reactionary government's betrayal of the people, even the funds allocated by the people for weir repairs were pocketed, which led to the abandonment of weir work and continuous floods. The major ones were three major floods (1933, 1936, and 1947). Take the flood in 1947 as an example. Because the Feisha Weir and the Renzi Weir and other projects near Dujiangyan were completely destroyed, it caused an unprecedented flood in sixty years. More than ten counties and cities under Chengdu were almost completely turned into a swamp, hundreds of households were swept away by the flood, more than 100,000 people were affected, more than 1,000 people were washed away by the flood, and the property loss was estimated at 60 billion yuan. Under the reactionary, corrupt, and feudal rule, this "land of abundance" known as "no famine for the people" had become a "hell" with "mournful cries everywhere." Therefore, when the people of western Sichuan recall this major flood, they are still indignant at the Kuomintang reactionary government. A citizen representative who participated in the Chengdu river channel and canal repair committee said: "In the past, we shouted about preventing floods every year, but in fact, we suffered floods every year!"

	However, since the People's Liberation Army liberated Chengdu on December 29 last year, this vast project related to the lives of tens of millions of people has been under the leadership of the People's Government, which allocated 3 million jin of rice for repairs and started the urgent repairs on December 31 (according to historical practice, in order not to delay the farming season, the Outer River should be closed and repaired during the Frost's Descent solar term, and the weir should be completed and opened at the beginning of the Spring solar term the following year; the Inner River should be closed and repaired at the beginning of the Spring solar term, and the weir should be completed and opened during the Qingming Festival, but due to the disrepair of the reactionary government, this year's annual repairs have been delayed for two months). The People's Liberation Army, which had advanced into western Sichuan, although it had just ended the battle, also transferred a regiment to assist the masses in the urgent repairs without compensation. Cadres and soldiers tirelessly dug the river and carried stones and sand overnight. Even during the most serious period of banditry in mid-February to early March, the People's Liberation Army was still "suppressing bandits while repairing the weir", and led the masses to bravely carry out urgent repairs without interruption. The 45 dikes and weirs, using 98,000 workdays and 95 days, were finally opened and released water on the day before the Qingming Festival. In terms of work hours, it was one-third shorter than the 150 workdays required during the reactionary government; in terms of cost, it cost 11,250 shi, which was three-fifths less than the reactionary government; in terms of engineering, it was done quickly and solidly. After completing the underwater project in early April, the above-water project was completed in early May. This ensures the increased production of 3 million mu of farmland on the Chengdu Plain and prevents the major floods in history. At the same time as this vast project, the main canals, bridges, and more than 20 large weirs such as the Minjiang, Tongji, and Zhulihuo in Chengdu City were also being repaired. These dikes and weirs were also completed one after another before June with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army. The garrison troops participating in the construction project in Chengdu City alone numbered more than 3,500, completing 20,000 cubic meters of riverbed engineering. Even if the rainfall is heavy this summer and some dikes and weirs are damaged, it will not cause a major disaster. Therefore, the broad masses of the people in western Sichuan praised the good deeds of the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army. They said in unison: "This is thanks to Chairman Mao for doing a great thing for the people of western Sichuan!" An old man named Leng Danru said: "I have lived for so long and have never seen such a good army!" The farmers in Qionglai even proposed to build a "stele" for the People's Liberation Army who built the Dayan Canal (Erlong Mountain, 70 miles northeast of Jiamentan)!

	The Scale of the Dujiangyan Project

	Dujiangyan not only has infinite water conservancy benefits and a wide range of irrigation areas (the inner and outer rivers have a total of 14 counties and 1 city, with an irrigation area of 2,900 square kilometers, a total of 3 million mu of land, and an average yield of 3.5 shi of rice per mu in summer and autumn, which can produce 10 million shi of rice per year), but also has an extremely grand scale of engineering, known as "Golden Guan Kou". Taking the entire project as an example, the main streams and tributaries of the inner and outer rivers (belonging to the Chengdu Plain) total about 100, with a total length of 587.57 kilometers, and the number of weirs branched out is 526, and the weirs branched out from each weir have 2,200, while the main engineering part of Dujiangyan extends for more than 4 li. Now, only a brief introduction to the engineering scale of its main parts is given.

	Water diversion project – the Yuzui (fish mouth) and Jingang Dike (diamond dike). The Yuzui is located under the Anlan Suspension Bridge in Xishan, Guan County, and is the tip of the water diversion point between the inner and outer rivers. It is a water diversion stone embankment built of blocks of stone, creating the starting point of Dujiangyan. Its shape is like the mouth of a fish, so it is called Yuzui. In order to resist the strong water force (the distance from Guan County to Chengdu is 60 kilometers, and the elevation difference is about 300 meters, and the water flow speed reaches 3 to 4 meters per second), it relies on it to divert water. During the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, iron turtles, iron oxen, and stone fish mouths were placed, but they were built and destroyed repeatedly. It was not until after 1935 that concrete slurry was used to build the stone blocks, and it still needs to be repaired year by year. The Jingang Dike connects the Yuzui and flows down to form a water diversion embankment. The one along the west bank of the Inner River is the Inner Jingang Dike, and the one along the east bank of the Outer River is the Outer Jingang Dike, both of which are made of cobblestones, and have the function of a water diversion dike and a bank protection.

	Bank protection project – the Baizhang Dike (hundred zhang dike), Shunshui Longba (water directing cage dam) and Renzi Dike (human character dike). The Baizhang Dike and the Shunshui Longba are both located on the east bank of the upstream of the river mouths of the inner and outer rivers. The Baizhang Dike is more than 500 meters long and is a bank protection dike built of cobblestones. The Shunshui Longba is made of cobblestones and bamboo cages piled up. Its left bank extends to the sandbar in the river to force most of the water into the main channel, so that the river water can enter the Inner River from the downstream water inlet and avoid water diversion. The Renzi Dike is on the right side of Baopingkou (bottle neck), connected to Feisha Weir above and Li Dui below. It is a high bank protection arc-shaped embankment made of cobblestone and bamboo cages stacked vertically and horizontally.

	Water surge project – Feisha Weir (flying sand weir) and Pingshui Cao (level water canal). Feisha Weir is located between the Jingang Dike and the Renzi Dike. It is a water surge dam built of bamboo cages and cobblestones after being excavated to prevent water from breaking horizontally and forcing water into Baopingkou; but at the same time, it is also a water overflow dam, which can allow excess water from the Inner River to flow back into the Outer River from the top of the dam. The Pingshui Cao is in the middle of the inner and outer rivers and is a small-scale water diversion channel to regulate the water volume of the Inner River. Excavation project – Fengxi Wo (phoenix perch nest) and Neijiang Hecao (Inner River channel). Fengxi Wo is located opposite Feisha Weir, that is, the half-moon-shaped depression between the foot of Yulei Mountain on the east bank of the Inner River and the foot of Xuanweimen Mountain in Guan County. After the sand and stones are flushed to Feisha Weir, they settle here. It needs to be excavated every year. There have been "copper and iron standard pillars" here for generations as the standard for the depth of the beach. Li Bing originally carved the ancient stele of "Dig the beach deep, build the weir low", which was unearthed here. In addition, the oldest project with the greatest value for regulating water volume is Li Dui, Baopingkou, which was carved out of the mountain by Li Bing and his son. The right mountain stone is named Li Dui. The advantage of this artificial channel is that it is not subject to water erosion and can reduce floods downstream.

	It is precisely because the Dujiangyan project is large in scale that the construction of the project is also extremely complex and difficult. According to the nature of the project, there are four types: annual repairs (those that must be repaired every year), major repairs (those that must be expanded and repaired every five years), special repairs (flood prevention), and emergency repairs. According to the project category and construction method, there are four types: cut-off engineering (Macha), dredging engineering, embankment engineering (bamboo cage masonry), and bank protection engineering (adding planting piles or filling stones with wooden frames, such as sheep in a circle, also known as sheep circle). Among them, Macha is the most economical and convenient and the most valuable. It is an important tool for cutting off and changing the flow of inner and outer rivers. The outer river mouth needs 40 to 50 caves (one Macha is called one cave), and the inner river mouth needs 60 to 75 caves. The structure of Macha is a three-legged wooden frame, with many three-legged frames connected in a row, and the top is filled with cobblestones and soil to form a perfect water barrier dam. After the Inner River is repaired, the Macha will be gradually removed. The number of removals is determined according to the amount of water coming from the upper reaches and the amount of water required by the Inner River.

	In terms of the method of repairing the project, due to the corruption and incompetence of the reactionary government, although experts once formulated a plan to improve the project in 1940, it has not been realized. Therefore, over the years, the masses have still used several old palliative methods left by Li Bing and his son: such as "Dig the beach deep, build the weir low" (six-character formula), "Cut corners when encountering a bend, draw the heart when encountering a straight line" (eight-character formula for river management), etc. Therefore, how to comprehensively plan and systematically improve the Dujiangyan project according to scientific principles in the future, so that the entire weir is operated by electricity, and the water volume of the inner and outer rivers can be arbitrarily adjusted without ever collapsing, this still needs to be studied by people's water conservancy experts.

　　四川著名灌溉工程——都江堰
    江横
    这个沃野千里，不知水旱灾的成都平原，其所以是中国最富庶的区域之一，是因为岷江上游有一个为亿万人民血汗所筑成的著名的都江堰水利工程。这个工程，现在人民政府领导抢修下重建起来，保证了成都平原三百万亩农田的灌溉，和造福于四百万人民免于大水之患。
  都江堰的创建和重建
    都江堰（亦叫都安堰，因灌县旧名都安）是我国古代一个大规模的灌溉工程，自秦以来，距现在已有二千三百年的历史了。据历史记载及川西传说：远在公历纪元前二五○年（秦孝文王元年），秦蜀郡太守李冰父子，因为岷江正流（今之外江，居右）下游沫水（雅河）为害，常泛滥成灾；而内江（居左）一带水流不畅，则频年苦旱，便在灌县城西岷江出山谷流入成都平原的总口处，凿离堆（凿玉垒山而过，故名）修大堰，分水入内江，使外江免于水患，而内江又能灌溉。同时，天旱可以引水，雨涝还可堵塞水门，这便是都江堰作用的伟大处。由于李冰及其子二郎在当时给人民办了这件好事，至今川中各地还奉祭他们。但实际上，就连历史上也不能否认的，就是这一浩大工程的筑成，主要还是依靠了历代亿万人民的力量。据风俗通志及水经注载：“冰捕孽龙，仲子歼灭余众。害除，民大悦，踊跃用命于冰父子挑关筑堰者亿万人。”又元揭蹊斯蜀堰碑称：“服役兵民多者万余人，少者千余人。”于此可见创建都江堰的历史主人是人民了。
    到民国以来，因反动政府叛离人民，就连人民公摊修堰的款项，都装了腰包，这就使堰工废弛，水患连年。举其大者就先后遭了三次（一九三三、一九三六、一九四七年）大水。以一九四七年的水灾来说吧，因为都江堰附近工程飞沙堰及人字堰等全被冲毁，造成六十年来空前未有的大水患。成都属十余县市几全变成一片泽国，数百住户房舍全被洪流扫卷一空，受害灾民在十万人以上，有千余人被洪流冲走，损失财产约计六百亿元。在反动的腐朽的封建统治下，使这号称“民无饥馑”的“天府”，已变成“哀鸿遍野”的“地狱”了。所以，现在川西人民回忆起这次大水灾来，对国民党反动政府还有些愤然。参加成都整修河道干沟委员会的市民代表就曾这样说：“过去年年叫喊防水患，实则年年遭水灾！”
    但从去年十二月二十九日人民解放军解放成都后，这个关系千万人民生活的浩大工程，便在人民政府领导下，拨出修理费三百万斤大米，于十二月三十一日即动工抢修了（按历史惯例，为不误农时，整理外江，应在霜降节截流修理，翌年立春节完工开堰；修理内江，应在立春节截流修理，清明节完工开堰，但因反动政府失修，今年岁修已延误两个月）。挺进川西的人民解放军，虽刚刚结束战役，也抽调了一个团来无代价的协助群众抢修，干部和战士们不辞疲劳的连夜挖河，担挑石沙。甚至在二月中旬到三月初旬匪患最严重的时候，解放军还是“一面剿匪，一面修堰”，并带领群众奋勇抢修，不曾中断。四十五处的堤堰，用了九万八千个工和九十五天的时间，终于在清明节的前一天开堰放水了。论工时，比反动政府时期需要一百五十天的工时，缩短了三分之一；论费用，花了一万一千二百五十市石，比反动政府时期节省了五分之三；论工程，做的又快又坚实。四月初完成水下工程后，五月初又完成水上工程。这就保证了成都平原三百万农田的增产，和预防了历史上的大水患。和这浩大工程同时进行修建的，还有成都市的干沟、桥梁及?江、通济、朱李火等大堰二十余条。这些堤堰也是在人民解放军协助下，于六月前先后完工。仅参加成都市修建工程的警备部队就有三千五百余人，完成了两万土方的河床工程。即使今夏雨水大，冲坏些堤堰，也不至造成巨灾。因此，川西广大的人民对人民政府及人民解放军这些善举，大为赞扬不已。他们众口同声的说：“这要多谢毛主席，为川西人民办了件大事！”一个叫冷淡如的老汉说：“活了这么大，还没见过这样好的军队！”邛崃一带的农民，还提出要为修建大堰沟（夹门关东北七十里二龙山）的解放军修“碑记”哩！
        都江堰工程的规模
    都江堰，不仅水利无穷，灌溉受益区域广阔（内外江合计有十四县一市，灌溉面积二千九百方公里，计土地三百万市亩，夏秋两季每亩平均产大米三石五斗，每年可产米一千万市石），而且工程规模极为宏大，有“金灌口”之称。如以全部工程来说，计内外江一百条左右的干流支流（属于成都平原者）总长为五八七点五七公里，其分出的堰数就有五二六道，各堰的分堰又有二二○○道，而都江堰的主要工程部分，就绵延有四里多长。现仅把它主要部分的工程规模作一简单介绍。
    分水工程——为都江鱼嘴和金刚堤，鱼嘴位于灌县西山安澜索桥下，为内江与外江分水的尖端，由块石砌成的分水石垠，造成都江堰发轫之点，其状又如鱼的口腔，故叫做鱼嘴。为了抵抗强大的水力（自灌县至成都相距六十公里，其高程相差约三百公尺，水流速度达每秒三至四公尺）。而赖它分水，元、明、清时，曾分置铁龟、铁牛、石鱼嘴，但屡筑屡毁，直到一九三五年后，才用混凝土浆砌块石，仍需逐年培修。金刚堤衔接鱼嘴，顺流而下成分水垠，沿内江作其西岸者为内金刚堤，沿外江作其东岸者为外金刚堤，都是卵石砌成的，具有分水堤和护岸的作用。
    护岸工程——为百丈堤、顺水笼坝和人字堤。百丈堤和顺水笼坝，均在内外江河口上游东岸，百丈堤长达五百公尺余，以卵石砌成的护岸堤，顺水笼坝则为卵石、竹笼垒积所成者，其左岸延至江中沙洲，以逼大部水量纳入正道，使江水得由下游引水口入内江，而免水势纷歧。人字堤则在宝瓶口右侧，上连飞沙堰，下接离堆，系用卵石竹笼纵纹叠叠所成的高护岸弧形堤垠。
    湃水工程——为飞沙堰与平水漕，飞沙堰在金刚堤和人字堤中间，为淘挖后用竹笼及卵石修筑的湃水坝，以防水横决，逼水入宝瓶口；但同时亦为一滚水坝，可以使内江过量的水，由坝顶流回外江。平水漕在内外两江中间，为小规模调节内江水量的一道泄水渠。淘挖工程——为凤栖窝及内江河漕。凤栖窝位于飞沙堰对方，即内江东岸玉垒山脚至灌县宣威门山脚下间半月形洼处，沙石冲滚至飞沙堰后，便沉淀在这里，每年需要淘挖，这里历代置有“铜铁标柱”，作为滩深浅度的标准，李冰原刻“深淘滩，低作堰”古碑，便是在这里挖出来的。另外，最古老而调节水量价值最大的工程，便是离堆、宝瓶口，这是李冰父子凿山而成者，其右山石名离堆，这个人工渠道的好处，既可以不受水流冲刷，又可以使下游减少水患。
    正因为都江堰工程规模宏大，所以工程的修建也极复杂艰巨。依工程的性质来分，有岁修（每年必须修理者）、大修（每隔五年须扩大培修一次）、特修（防洪者）和抢修四种。依工程类别及施工方法，有截流工（杩槎）、淘挖工、堤垠工（竹笼砌卵石）、护脚工（加栽桩木或以木框填石，如羊之在圈，又名羊圈）等四种。其中以杩槎最为经济便利，而价值最大，为内外江截流改流的重要工具。外江口需要四十至五十洞（一个杩槎叫一洞），内江口则需六十至七十五洞，杩槎的构造为一木三足架，以许多三足架连接成排列，上边满装上卵石泥土，便构成一完美的挡水坝。待内江修理完后，杩槎便逐渐拆去，其拆去之数，是根据上游水的来量和内江所需水量而定。
    在修理工程的方法上，因反动政府腐败无力，虽一九四○年曾经专家拟定改善工程计划，但一直没能实现，故历年来群众仍沿用李冰父子遗留下的几个旧的治标方法：如“深淘滩，低作堰”（六字诀），“过湾截角，逢正抽心”（治河八字诀）等。因之，今后如何根据科学的原理，统盘筹划，有步骤的改善都江堰的工程，使全堰用电力操纵，任意调节内外江的水量，而永不溃决，这还有待于人民水利专家们的研究。
