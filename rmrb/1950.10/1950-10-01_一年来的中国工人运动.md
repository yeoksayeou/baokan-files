China's Labor Movement in the Past Year

    The number of trade union members nationwide has grown to over four million.
    China's labor movement has achieved unprecedented development in the past year.

    Taking the National Trade Union Work Conference convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions last July as an opportunity, the closed-doorism that had previously existed in trade union organizational work has been basically overcome in the past year. Last October, there were 2.46 million trade union members nationwide. By July of this year, this had grown to 4.09 million, accounting for 31 percent of the nation's total workforce of 12.85 million.

    Looking at the major industrial sectors and major cities nationwide, workers have been basically organized. In major cities across the country, the proportion of workers who have been organized accounts for 55 to 88 percent of the total number of workers in each city. In Shanghai, more than 85 percent of the city's workers have been organized. In major industrial sectors nationwide, 65 to 86 percent of workers have been organized. Among the 460,000 railway workers, the proportion organized has reached 92.22 percent.

    The successive formation of various industrial trade unions is also a major feature of trade union organizational work over the past year. At present, national committees of seven industrial trade unions, including railway, postal and telecommunications, transportation, textile, electricity, ordnance, and education, have been established. In addition, four industrial systems have established national preparatory committees for trade unions, and four industries have organized working committees.

    The policy of orienting trade union work towards production has been implemented.

    The greatest achievement of trade union work in the past year has been the clear definition and gradual implementation of the policy of orienting trade union work towards production, and the finding of specific methods to realize this policy by organizing production competitions. This has gradually resolved the phenomenon of disconnect or even disharmony between trade union work and administrative work in the past, giving trade union work a lively and rich content. The two production conferences convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in February and May respectively clearly pointed out that production competition is a regular mode of labor and lifestyle for the working class after becoming masters of the country, criticized the incorrect practice of turning production competitions into crash programs in some areas, and especially criticized the erroneous view of some trade union workers that engaging in production competitions in private enterprises would "lose their position."

    Trade unions take organizing production competitions as their central task.

    The role that trade unions have played in organizing production competitions and doing a good job in production in promoting the restoration and development of the national economy has proven to be extremely significant. For example, in the railway sector, the national average vehicle turnover rate has now been shortened by 1.22 days compared to last November, the on-time rate has reached over 98 percent, and the average daily mileage of locomotives has increased to 337 kilometers, exceeding the highest standard of 229 kilometers during the Japanese puppet Manchukuo period in the Northeast by 42.5 percent. In the coal mining sector, the production efficiency of state-owned mines in Northeast, North China, East China, and Central South has increased by 70 to 100 percent compared to before liberation. The average daily productivity of coal miners in Northeast has reached 0.54 tons (the highest reaching 0.7 tons), exceeding the 0.36 tons during the Japanese puppet Manchukuo period by 50 percent. In the cotton textile industry, the average output of 20-count yarn per spindle per 20 hours at Tianjin Zhongfang reached 1.122 pounds in June, an increase of 9 percent compared to the output in December 1949.

    Establishing labor-management consultation meetings to improve labor-management relations.

    In private enterprises, wherever trade union organizations have, in accordance with the policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital, begun to implement the policy of orienting towards production through the establishment of labor-management consultation meetings or the signing of collective contracts, labor-management relations have generally improved, and production efficiency has also increased. For example, at Tianjin's private Hengyuan Yarn Factory, the output of 20-count yarn per spindle per 20 hours was 0.7495 pounds in January of this year. In May, after the trade union led workers to launch a production competition, it increased to 0.8320 pounds. According to statistics from 37 private yarn factories in Shanghai in the first week of June this year, the output of 20-count yarn per spindle per 20 hours has reached 0.816 pounds, exceeding the pre-liberation record of 0.779 pounds. The output of the four major private yarn factories in Wuhan has also increased from 0.686 pounds before liberation to 0.7459 pounds in June of this year.

    Mobilizing workers to improve and innovate technology and increase labor efficiency.

    In terms of how to mobilize workers to increase labor efficiency, trade unions at all levels have paid special attention to encouraging workers' enthusiasm and creativity in improvement and innovation over the past year. The past practice of simply increasing labor intensity to improve labor efficiency has now been criticized in many trade unions.

    In the five months from January to May of this year, workers in public and private enterprises in Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, Hebei, and Shandong alone had 1,134 relatively significant inventions and innovations. During roughly the same period, 17,232 new records also appeared in 116 factories and mines under the Northeast Industrial Department. As a result, a large number of labor models and advanced producers have emerged in various industries and regions across the country. In the seven cities of Shanghai, Wuhan, Anshan, Fushun, Tangshan, Xuzhou, and Kaifeng alone, there are 21,661 labor models in various factories and mines, and more than 50,000 advanced producers have emerged in 116 factories and mines in Northeast.

    The material and cultural life of workers has gradually improved.

    With the improvement and development of production, the material and cultural life of workers has also gradually improved. According to statistics from the Dalian General Trade Union, the purchasing power of wages of more than 109,000 workers in Dalian in May of this year increased by 292 percent compared to 1947. The average wage of workers throughout Northeast also increased by 27 percent in December of last year compared to May. The average wage this year increased by another 8 percent compared to December of last year (in Northeast and Dalian, prices have long been stable, so the increase in wages is also an increase in workers' actual income). In various parts of Guannei (areas within the Shanhaiguan pass), prices have also generally stabilized since March of this year. The purchasing power of wages of the vast number of workers has therefore also increased.

    State-owned enterprises launch labor insurance and welfare work.

    Labor insurance and welfare work has been launched in many state-owned enterprises. According to incomplete statistics, Northeast has established 541 hospitals and clinics, 23 sanatoriums and rest homes, and 3 homes for the disabled. The total number of workers enjoying labor insurance benefits has reached 550,000, and the number of workers' family members guaranteed by the labor insurance system has reached more than 1.5 million. In the past year, the Northeast People's Government built more than 1 million square meters of housing, solving the housing problems for more than 90,000 single workers and 28,000 workers with families. This year, it will continue to solve the housing problems for 70,000 single workers and 49,000 workers with families. Labor insurance and welfare work in other areas such as Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Shanxi, and in the railway, postal and telecommunications, and other industrial systems has also begun. In addition, with the help of the government, workers' cooperatives have been generally established in various places to supply workers with a large number of daily necessities at prices lower than market prices.

    680,000 workers in Northeast, North China, East China, and Central South have participated in part-time school studies.

    In terms of cultural life, according to incomplete statistics from the four regions of Northeast, North China, East China, and Central South, more than 680,000 workers have participated in part-time school studies. In the Northeast region alone, there are 3,624 part-time schools.

    With the gradual arrival of the high tide of national economic construction, the labor movement will be launched more extensively and deeply in the future. The promulgation of the Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China on June 29 has laid a better foundation for the development of trade union work in the future. At present, trade union organizations in various places are carrying out rectification in accordance with the "Instructions on Rectifying Trade Union Organizations and the Work Style of Trade Union Cadres" issued by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on August 13, in order to overcome the serious bureaucratic style of work that still exists in some trade union organizations and trade union cadres, which is characterized by being monopolistic, acting as a substitute, issuing compulsory orders, and being divorced from the masses. On this basis, trade union work across the country will surely be further developed and consolidated.

　　一年来的中国工人运动
    全国工会会员发展到四百余万人
    中国工人运动一年来已得到空前发展。
    以去年七月中华全国总工会召开的全国工会工作会议为契机，过去工会组织工作中曾经存在过的关门主义倾向，一年来已在基本上被克服。去年十月，全国共有工会会员二百四十六万人，到今年七月，已发展到四百零九万人，占全国职工总数一千二百八十五万人的百分之三十一。
    如以全国各主要产业部门和各主要城市来看，职工则已基本上组织起来。全国各大城市职工已经组织起来的占各该城市职工总数百分之五十五到百分之八十八；其中上海市的职工组织起来的已占全市职工总数的百分之八十五以上。全国主要产业部门的职工也有百分之六十五到八十六组织起来。铁路职工四十六万人中组织起来的则达到百分之九十二点二二。
    各种产业工会的先后组成，亦是一年来工会组织工作的一大特点。目前已有铁路、邮电、搬运、纺织、电业、兵工、教育等七个产业工会的全国委员会建立起来；另外有四个产业系统建立了工会的全国筹备委员会，四个产业组织了工作委员会。
    贯彻了工会工作面向生产的方针
    一年来工会工作的最大成效是明确地确定并逐渐地贯彻了工会工作面向生产的方针，并找到了以组织生产竞赛为实现这一方针的具体方法，因而逐步解决了过去工会工作和行政工作脱节甚至不协调的现象，使工会工作有了生动丰富的内容。今年二月和五月全国总工会先后召开的两次生产会议，即明确地指出了生产竞赛乃是工人阶级当了国家主人以后经常的劳动方式和生活方式，批判了某些地方把生产竞赛搞成突击运动的不正确作法；特别是批判了一些工会工作者认为在私营企业中搞生产竞赛就会“失掉立场”的错误看法。
    工会把组织生产竞赛作为中心任务
    工会把组织生产竞赛搞好生产作为中心任务来执行，这对于恢复和发展国家经济所起的作用，已经证明是极其显著的。如在铁道方面，全国平均车辆运转率现在已较去年十一月缩短了一点二二天，正点率达百分之九十八以上，机车日行公里平均提高到三百三十七公里，超过东北在伪满时期最高标准二百二十九公里的百分之四十二点五。煤矿方面，东北、华北、华东、中南国营矿井的生产效率已比解放前提高了百分之七十到百分之一百。东北煤矿工人每日平均生产率已达到零点五四吨（最高的达到零点七吨）超过伪满时期的零点三六吨的百分之五十。棉织业方面，天津中纺二十支纱每锭每二十小时的平均产量，六月份已达一点一二二磅，较一九四九年十二月产量增加百分之九。
    建立劳资协商会议改进劳资关系
    在私营企业中，凡工会组织已根据发展生产劳资两利的政策，通过建立劳资协商会议或签订集体合同，开始执行了面向生产方针的工厂或行业，劳资关系一般均有改进，生产效率也有提高。如天津私营恒源纱厂，今年一月，二十支纱二十小时每锭产量为零点七四九五磅。五月间工会领导工人开展生产竞赛后，即提高到零点八三二○磅。另据上海三十七家私营纱厂今年六月第一周的统计，每一纱锭二十小时二十支纱的产量已达零点八一六磅，已超过解放前零点七七九磅的纪录。武汉四大私营纱厂产量亦由解放前的零点六八六磅提高到今年六月份的零点七四五九磅。
    发动职工提高和改进技术，提高劳动效率
    在如何发动职工提高劳动效率上面，一年来各级工会特别注意了鼓舞工人在提高和改进方面的积极性和创造性。过去单纯以增强劳动强度来提高劳动效率的做法，现在已在不少工会中受到批判。
    今年一月到五月的五个月中，仅天津、张家口两市和河北、山东两地的公私营企业职工，就有一千一百三十四件比较重大的发明创造；差不多同一期间，东北工业部所属一百一十六个厂矿中，亦出现了一万七千二百三十二件新纪录。这样，大批的劳动模范和先进生产者，便在全国各产业和各地区中产生了。仅上海、武汉、鞍山、抚顺、唐山、徐州、开封七个城市中，各厂矿的劳动模范就有二万一千六百六十一名，东北一百一十六个厂矿中，涌现的先进生产者达五万余人。
    职工物质生活和文化生活已逐步改善
    随着生产的提高和发展，职工们的物质生活和文化生活也已逐步地得到了改善。据旅大总工会统计，旅大十万九千多职工，今年五月工资购买力比一九四七年提高了百分之二百九十二，整个东北职工的平均工资，去年十二月比五月亦提高了百分之二十七；今年的平均工资则又比去年十二月提高了百分之八（按东北以及旅大地区，物价早已稳定，因此工资的增加也就是工人实际收入的提高）。在关内各地，自今年三月以后，物价亦已普趋稳定。广大职工的工资购买力亦因此而有所提高。
    国营企业展开劳保福利工作
    劳动保险和福利工作在不少国营企业已经展开。据不完全统计，东北已建立了五百四十一所医院及医疗所，二十三个疗养院及休息所和三个残废院；享受劳动保险待遇的职工总数达五十五万人；得到劳保制度保障的职工亲属达一百五十多万。去年一年中，东北人民政府修建住宅面积一百多万平方公尺，解决了九万多单身工人和两万八千户有家属工人的住房问题。今年将继续为七万单身工人和四万九千有家属的工人解决住房问题。其他天津、石家庄、山西等地和铁路、邮电等产业系统的劳保福利的工作亦已开始。此外，在政府的帮助下，各地职工合作社已普遍建立，以大量低于市价的日常用品供应职工们。
    东北、华北、华东、中南等区六十八万职工参加了业余学校学习
    在文化生活方面据东北、华北、华东、中南四个地区不完全统计，已有六十八万余职工参加了业余学校的学习。仅东北一区即有业余学校三千六百二十四所。
    随着国家经济建设高潮的逐步到来，今后工人运动将更广泛更深入地展开。今年六月二十九日中华人民共和国工会法的颁布，已为今后工会工作的发展奠定了更好的基础。目前各地工会组织正在按照中华全国总工会八月十三日发出的《关于整顿工会组织与工会干部作风》的指示进行整风，以克服目前某些工会组织与工会干部中还存在着的严重的包办代替、强迫命令的脱离群众的官僚主义作风。在这一基础上，全国工会工作必将得到更进一步的发展和巩固。
