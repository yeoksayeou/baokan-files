　　American “Literature” that Poisons Minds
    奥·莫宪斯基
    Since ancient times, literature has always been regarded as one of the highest expressions of human culture. At least a few decades ago, when people appreciated the works of Tolstoy, Dickens, Balzac, Mark Twain, etc., they still said so. However, as everyone knows, today's American official propagandists are doing everything possible to praise the various "achievements" of modern American culture, and are tirelessly forcing other nations to accept these "achievements." What exactly is the culture they are promoting? What kind of "highly artistic" works are available for the general American to amuse themselves with? In what direction does it influence readers?
    The United States publishes 250 new detective novels every year, in addition to reprinting about the same number of existing novels of this type. The publication volume of these detective novels reaches millions of copies. On gaudy and vulgar covers, either bloody corpses or fully armed robbers are depicted. These books are always with Americans. Various reactionary newspapers in the United States are concerned about the sales of such books and are trying their best to promote detective literary works. The main suppliers of this kind of literary works, such as Diamond, Lennon, or Henry Miller, are unanimously praised by the press as promoters of the "true American" spirit.
    In the United States, only so-called "comic book novels" are on par with detective novels. These novels are a unique product of "American genius." No other country would compete with them in this kind of invention. Generally, these comic book novels are published in installments, each volume containing about 35 to 50 pages. The stories in the books are accompanied by crude pictures and simple words. Obviously, readers can use their brains even more effortlessly when reading these comic book novels than when reading detective novels.
    According to the proof of the American publishing industry (for example, "Newsweek"), 300 to 400 kinds of these comic book novels are published every month, of which more than 270 kinds are regularly serialized series, with a total annual publication volume of 720 million copies. The circulation amount of these publications accounts for one-third of the circulation amount of the national publishing industry.
    What do these small comic books tell readers who are addicted to bloody horror cases? According to American statistics, adults account for 60% of the readers of these small books, and children account for 40%. These small books, just like those detective novels, guide the readers' imagination in the same direction. These two extremely popular contemporary American "literatures" are no different in content. The comic book tells only about cunning bandits and outstanding detectives who appear and disappear mysteriously. It also depicts, with appropriate pictures, the murders and rapes caused by sadomasochism and the pleasure of committing crimes, which are unique to general American detective novels, to the fullest extent. Therefore, comic books, like detective novel "works," are completely full of pornography.
    The following titles - "Women's Crimes," "White-Haired Ghost," "Superman," "Demon Master," "Secret Agent," "Torch Man," are the eye-catching names of some regularly serialized comic book publications.
    The comic books and detective novels, which account for the vast majority of American book publications, are identical in content to Hollywood movies and American domestic radio "literary broadcasts." The groans of the victims that shock movie audiences and the triumphant cries of those "supermen" who kill them enter their eardrums from the radio at home. All reactionary "literature" in the United States suppresses the general American in an atmosphere of taking pride in doing evil.
    However, don't think that there is a fundamental difference in nature between the "decent literature" of the American reactionaries and the "popular literature" supplied to millions of people. According to the self-confession of the American magazine "Weekend Literary Review," this kind of decent literature is also a description of the application of private torture and distortion of facts to some neurasthenia patients, psychopaths, and patients in mental hospitals.
    In the United States, it is simply impossible to find a book that does not talk about murder cases, does not describe sadomasochists and madmen. There is even a special literary trend called "clinical realism" that is interested in. The writers of this school claim in their works that there is no boundary between normal psychology and morbid psychology. For example, the protagonist Adams in Charlie Jackson's novel "The Outer Edge" committed a murder, not because of money, but because of his nature. After Adams killed two children, the residents of the city where he lived all became mentally ill. Even residents who had always been law-abiding tried to commit murder. It turned out that the instinct to commit crimes had long been lurking in the hearts of each of them. The most interesting thing is the scene of interrogating Adams. The judge allowed the prisoner to state his last wish. Adams calmly said:
    "I want to raze a city to the ground."
    This sentence explains a lot. It is not accidental that it reminds people of the clichéd speeches of American political figures. It helps to answer a question: Why do American literature and other arts today regard promoting evil as their main task? What is this for?
    Let's look at the answer from Legman, the deputy editor of the American magazine "Neurosis." This answer was published in the discussion column of "Daily Guide" with the title "Is the Popularity of Detective Literature a Sign of Secular Depravity?"
    Legman wrote: "You say your master abuses you and exploits you, right? But don't kill him, or you will be hanged. You kill him on paper every night, and consider yourself a detective, and he is the murderer you want to chase. In this way, novels like assassination can prevent revolution... Disillusionment is an indispensable feature of 20th-century life, which makes people have to swallow a large amount of assassination literature, from the murder cases in the newspaper headlines at the breakfast table to the novels of midnight murder... So when we are fantasizing about violence and death, it is best to regard ourselves as murderers or supermen."
    This explanation does have some truth. Indeed, in a country where money is supreme, there is too much disillusionment among the common people. Therefore, American reactionaries have degraded culture to the position of a lightning rod, or more precisely, regard it as opium. Literature, movies, radio - the American ruling class uses all of this to lure the American people's thoughts away from the acute problems in their sad lives.
    However, this explanation is not enough. There is another purpose for American reactionary "art" to promote banditry, which can be said to be a diplomatic attempt. The protagonists in this kind of art are brutal and bloodthirsty supermen who can do whatever they want, which is not accidental that it reminds people that all this is exactly the same as the "White-Haired Beast" praised by the Nazi leaders back then. The American reactionaries instill in ordinary Americans that assassination is a human talent and natural behavior, thus educating new Hitler-style stormtroopers. They are trying to suppress the American people's desire to coexist peacefully with all nations. They hope that every American dreams of "razing" a city to the ground.
    Therefore, it is not a coincidence that the United States ships a large number of detective novels and Hollywood movies to Marshallized countries. According to the arrogant attempt of American imperialists, these books and movies will promote the emergence of a large number of mercenaries who will fight for the establishment of Anglo-American world hegemony.
    Of course, there is also real art in today's America, progressive literature with true literary qualities. For example, the works of Howard Fast and Albert Maltz are also well-known outside the United States. But the reactionaries use all possible means to suppress the activities of these heroic writers and eliminate any freedom of thought in the United States. They imprisoned Howard Fast. The rulers of the United States do not want anyone to interfere with their poisoning of the consciousness of the American people.
    At the same time, even the most reactionary American newspapers are panicking and admitting that the popularity of detective novels and Hollywood movies, which were extremely popular in recent years, has been declining. This is an inevitable trend. An increasing number of American working people have seen through the true face of the "terrorist propaganda" carried out by the "literary" agents of the reactionaries. More and more American people have begun to realize what kind of abyss the giants of Wall Street are trying to push them into. The powerful world movement to support peace has swept the globe, and this movement is also growing and expanding in the United States. (Reprinted from "Era" this year, Issue 16)

　　毒害意识的美国“文学”
    奥·莫宪斯基
    自古以来，一向认为文学是人类文化的最高表现之一。至少在几十年以前，人们在欣赏托尔斯泰、狄更斯、巴尔札克、马克吐温等的作品时，还是如此说法的。可是，大家知道，今天的美国官方宣传员，想尽方法在讴歌现代美国文化的种种“成就”，喋喋不休地强制其他民族去接受这些“成就”。试问他们所宣传的文化究竟是些什么呢？到底是些什么“高度艺术性”的作品足供一般美国人消遣呢？它在那个方向里影响着读者呢？
    美国每年出版着二百五十种新的侦探小说，此外还在翻印约同等数量的此类旧有小说。这些侦探小说的出版量达数百万册。在花花绿绿的俗不可耐的封面上，不是绘着血淋淋的尸体，便是全副武装的强盗的书，随时随地都不离开美国人的身边。美国反动派的各种报纸，关心着这种书的销路，竭力宣传侦探文艺作品。这种文艺作品的主要供应者像翟蒙、勒农或亨利·米勒，报界一致把他们捧为“真正美国”精神的宣扬者。
    在美国只有所谓“连环图画小说”，足以与侦探小说并驾齐驱。这些小说是“美国天才”的特有产物。这类发明中的一部分，任何其他国家是不会去和他们竞争的。普通这种连环图画小说，大都是分集出版的，每册约三十五至五十页。而书里的故事，则用粗野的图画配以简单的字句。显然使读者在阅读这些连环图画小说时，脑筋的运用，可较阅读侦探小说更为省力。
    据美国出版界的证明（例如《新闻周刊》，）这种连环图画小说，每月出版三百至四百种，其中二百七十种以上，是定期连载丛书，全年总出版量达七亿二千万册。这些刊物出版人的流通金额，占全国出版界流通金额的三分之一。
    这些连环图画的小书，对沉溺于血腥恐怖案件的读者们究竟讲些什么？据美国的统计资料，这些小书的读者，成人占百分之六十，儿童占百分之四十。这些小书正和那些侦探小说一样，把读者的幻想导至同一方向。这两种红极一时的当代美国“文学”，在内容上并无任何差别。连环图画所叙述的，只是些神出鬼没的狡猾盗匪和机谋卓越的侦探。它又把一般美国侦探小说所特有的那些因患淫虐症并以犯罪称快而造成的谋杀案和强奸案，用适当的画面，淋漓尽致地描绘出来。所以连环图画正如侦探小说“作品”一样，完全充满了色情。
    下列几个书名——《女人的罪行》、《白发鬼》、《超人》、《伏魔大师》、《特务》、《火炬人》，正是某些按期连载的连环图画刊物的触目名称。
    占美国书籍出版量绝大多数的连环图画和侦探小说，在内容上与好莱坞的电影和美国国内无线电的“文艺广播”，简直是如出一辙。震慑着电影观众的被害者呻吟声和杀害他们的那些“超人”的得意叫嚣，在家里从收音机中传入了他们的耳鼓。美国的一切反动“文艺”，都把一般美国人压制在以作恶为荣的气氛中。
    不过，不要以为美国反动派的“正派文学”与供给千百万群众的“通俗文学”，有性质上的根本差别。证诸美国《周末文学评论》杂志的自供，这种正派文学也是对于一些神经衰弱者、心理变态者、疯人院中的病人等施用私刑和曲解事实的描述。
    在美国简直找不到一本不讲谋杀案、不描写淫虐狂和疯人的书。甚至有所谓“临床现实主义”的特殊文艺潮流的兴趣，这一派的作家在其作品中宣称，正常心理和病态心理之间并无界限存在。例如查利·杰克孙所著的小说《外缘》中的主角阿达姆斯，他犯一件命案，起因并非由于谋财，因为本性需要如此。在阿达姆斯杀死了两个儿童之后，在他居住的地方，全城居民都害了精神病。甚至一向安份守己的居民，也企图作杀人的尝试。原来，在他们中间每一个人的心里，很早就潜伏着犯罪的本能。最有意思的，是审问阿达姆斯的一幕。法官准许犯人申述他最后的愿望。阿达姆斯就从容地说：
    “我想炸平一个城市。”
    这句话说明了很多东西，它并非偶然地使人连想到美国政界名人的那些老生常谈的演辞。它帮助解答一个问题，就是当今美国文艺和其他各种艺术为什么要把宣扬罪恶当作他们主要的工作。这究竟是为了什么呢？
    且看美国《神经病》杂志的副主笔莱格曼的解答。这解答曾载在《每日指南》的讨论栏上，题目是《侦探文学的流行是否是世俗堕落的标志？》
    莱格曼写道：“你说，你的主人虐待你，剥削你，是吗？但是你不要杀死他，否则你会被绞死的。你每天晚上在纸上杀死他罢，把你自己当做一名侦探，而他正是你要追逐的凶手。这样一来，暗杀之类的小说便可以预防革命……幻灭是二十世纪生活中不可缺少的特点，使人不得不吞噬大量暗杀文艺，由早餐餐座上报纸标题的人命案子起，到午夜凶杀案之类的小说止……。所以我们在幻想着暴行和死亡时，最好把自己也视作凶手或超人。”
    这种解释倒有着一部分真理。诚然，在金元至上的国家中，老百姓的幻灭是太多了。因此美国反动分子已把文化贬低到避雷针的地位，或者可以更正确些说，把它当做鸦片。文学、电影、无线电——美国统治阶级利用这一切，来引诱美国人的思想离开他们那悲愁生活中的尖锐问题。
    但是，这种解释是不够的。美国反动“艺术”所以宣传强盗主义，是另有其用意的，可说是有外交企图的。这种艺术中的主角是些残暴嗜血，可以为所欲为的超人，使人并非偶然地想到这一切和当年纳粹头子所赞赏的《白发兽》是一模一样。美国反动派向普通的美国人灌输着暗杀是人的天赋和自然的操行，这样便教育出了新的希特勒式的冲锋团。他们企图压制美国老百姓与各民族和平共处的愿望。他们希望每个美国人幻想着去“炸平”一个城市。
    所以，美国将大量的侦探小说和好莱坞影片运往马歇尔化国家，并不是一件偶然的事情。照美国帝国主义者的狂妄企图，这些书籍电影，会促使为建立英美世界霸权去作战的大批佣兵的出现。
    当然，在今日的美国也有真正的艺术，具有真实文艺性的前进文学。例如霍华·法斯特和亚尔培·马兹的著作，在美国国外也是声名卓著的。但反动派用尽一切可能方法设法去压制这些英勇文人的活动，消灭美国国内任何的思想自由，他们囚禁霍华·法斯特。美国的统治者不愿有人去干涉他们毒害美国人民的意识。
    同时，甚至于最反动的美国报纸，也恐慌地承认最近几年内红极一时的侦探小说和好莱坞影片的流行，已日趋衰落。这是必然的趋向。数目日益增多的美国劳动大众，看透了反动派的“文学”代理人所进行的“恐怖宣传”的真面目。越来越多的美国老百姓已开始了解到华尔街的巨头们是想把他们推到什么样的深渊里去。强大的世界拥护和平运动，已席卷全球，这一运动也同样在美国日益增长，日益扩展中。（转载《时代》本年第十六期）
