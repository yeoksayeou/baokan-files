Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 14th: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly concluded the general debate on the various recommendations in the "United Action for Peace" proposal on October 13th. Representatives from Israel, the United States, and the Soviet Union delivered speeches.

The Israeli representative, Eban, in commencing his speech, emphasized that the unanimity of the five permanent members of the Security Council is necessary for the effective maintenance of international peace and security. Therefore, he supported the two proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation and requested the major powers—the permanent members of the Security Council—to consult with each other in accordance with Article 106 of the Charter to take the actions necessary to maintain peace and security and to take measures to ensure that the provisions of the Charter stipulating that UN member states place armed forces at the disposal of the Security Council are implemented as soon as possible.

Speaking of the seven-nation proposal, the Israeli representative said that his delegation substantially supported the proposal but put forward several amendments. The first amendment proposed by Israel to the preamble of the seven-nation proposal suggested that all member states of the United Nations have an obligation to seek the possibility of peaceful settlement of international disputes. Another amendment by Israel suggested that only in cases where consultations between major powers in accordance with Article 106 of the United Nations Charter are deadlocked (it is known that the proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation have pointed out the necessity of such consultations) could the measures stipulated in the seven-nation proposal (such as convening a special session of the General Assembly, etc.) be used.

Another Israeli amendment referred to the first part of the seven-nation proposal; the amendment suggested that the General Assembly only has the right to recommend actions to maintain international peace and security in cases of actual breaches of the peace or acts of aggression. It was previously reported that the existing seven-nation proposal stipulates that the General Assembly can take such actions even when "peace is threatened."

Other amendments proposed by the Israeli representative suggested deleting from the seven-nation proposal the clause regarding any seven members of the Security Council being able to convene a special session of the General Assembly. He pointed out that passing this clause would mean violating the United Nations Charter, according to which this power is only granted to the Security Council as a whole or to the majority of the United Nations member states.

Israeli representative Eban also opposed a recommendation in the seven-nation proposal to establish a group of military experts at the request of individual member states of the United Nations to provide technical advice in the training of the "United Nations Forces" stipulated in this proposal. Eban concluded by expressing doubt as to the advisability of establishing a Collective Action Committee.

The next speaker, U.S. representative Dulles, attempted to portray the situation as if the Soviet Union were the "sole vehement opponent" of the U.S. proposal, although, as previously reported, delegations from many countries also opposed certain items in the proposal. Dulles repeated the familiar slanders against the Soviet Union and its foreign policy. While avoiding consideration of the legal arguments raised by critics of the seven-nation proposal, first and foremost the Soviet delegation, Dulles carefully avoided Article 11, paragraph 2, of the Charter, according to which the General Assembly must submit all questions requiring action to the Security Council. He then groundlessly asserted that the recommendations contained in the seven-nation proposal fully complied with the United Nations Charter and principles. He equally groundlessly declared that it was incorrect for delegations to object to granting the General Assembly a power that it did not possess, namely, the power to make recommendations regarding actions that must be taken to maintain peace and security. Dulles then arbitrarily launched a routine attack on the principle of unanimity of the five permanent members of the Security Council.

Dulles attempted to defend the clause in the seven-nation proposal that any seven members of the Security Council could convene a special session of the General Assembly. He said that this clause did not conflict with the United Nations Charter, and that convening a special session was a "procedural" matter and therefore could be decided by a simple majority vote of any seven members of the Security Council.

Dulles also said that the drafters of the seven-nation proposal were willing to draft another proposal that would include certain amendments proposed by other delegations and would "eliminate" the "fears" that arose during the debate on the suggestion to establish a Collective Action Committee.

Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky later made a long speech summarizing the results of the general debate. Vyshinsky began his speech by emphasizing that all those who truly believe that the task and goal of the United Nations is to prevent the threat of a new war, strengthen peace, and ensure the security of all countries are extremely concerned about the issues currently being discussed.

After emphatically pointing out the importance of the issue under discussion, Vyshinsky pointed out that during the long and important discussion, sufficient attention had been paid to the reasons put forward by the Soviet delegation, the suggestions it made, and the suggestions it believed needed to be endorsed, which would help to strengthen the great cause of peace and the security of all countries. In summarizing the results of the general debate, Vyshinsky spoke of the Bolivian representative's speech, saying that it was crude in form, intolerable, and essentially a mockery of the facts, built on distortions of these facts and fabrications of history.

Vyshinsky commented in detail on the speeches of the drafters of the seven-nation proposal and their supporters. He criticized the speeches of the representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and other countries who had defended the proposal. Later, he also explained the Soviet delegation's views on all the main issues discussed during the general debate. A significant portion of Vyshinsky's speech discussed the legal basis for the privileges of the Security Council as stipulated in the United Nations Charter and the division of powers between the Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly.

Vyshinsky concluded by urging the Political Committee to decide the issue currently under consideration in accordance with the fundamental principles of the United Nations and in the spirit of the Charter, in order to effectively maintain international peace and security.

The General Assembly listened intently to Vyshinsky's speech.

After Vyshinsky finished speaking, the chairman announced that at the committee's next meeting, the proposers of the seven-nation proposal would submit a proposal that would take into account the amendments and additions proposed during the general debate, as well as the suggestions in the Chilean proposal.

The Political Committee then adjourned and will reconvene on the morning of October 14th.

　　联大政委会结束七国提案一般辩论
    维辛斯基发言综述辩论结果
    敦促政委会遵照宪章精神解决问题
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社纽约十四日讯：联合国大会政治委员会十月十三日结束了“保障和平的联合行动”案中各项建议的一般辩论。以色列、美国和苏联代表都发表了演说。
    以色列代表依班在开始其演说时强调指出：为了有效地维持国际和平与安全，安理会五个常任理事国意见的一致是必要的。因此，他支持苏联代表团所提出的两个提案，并要求大国——安理会常任理事国——依照宪章第一百零六条彼此协商，以采取为维持和平与安全所必需的行动，并采取措施使宪章中规定联合国会员国将武装部队供安理会支配的条款得以尽速实现。
    以色列代表在说到七国提案时说：他的代表团实质上是支持这个提案的，但他提出若干修正案。以色列对七国提案序言所提出的第一个修正案建议：联合国所有会员国有义务寻求和平解决国际纠纷的可能性。以色列的另一个修正案建议：只有在大国间依照联合国宪章第一百零六条进行的协商陷于僵局的情形下（大家知道，苏联代表团所提出的提案已指出这种协商的必要性），才能运用七国提案所规定的各项措施（如召开大会特别会议等等）。
    以色列的另一个修正案提到七国提案的第一部分；该修正案建议：只有在确实破坏和平或发生侵略行为的情况下，大会才有权建议为维持国际和平与安全而采取行动。前曾报道，现有的七国提案规定即使在“和平受到威胁”的时候，大会也可以采取这种行动。
    以色列代表提出的其他修正案建议从七国提案中删除关于安理会的任何七个理事国可以召开大会特别会议这一项。他指出，通过这一项将意味着违反联合国宪章，按照宪章，这种权力只赋予安理会全体或联合国会员国的多数。
    以色列代表依班也反对七国提案中的这样一项建议，即在联合国个别成员国的请求下，成立军事专家小组以便在训练这个提案中所规定的“联合国部队”方面提供技术性意见。依班末了对于是否宜于建立集体行动委员会一节表示怀疑。
    接着发言的美国代表杜勒斯企图把情况说成好象苏联是美国提案的“唯一猛烈的反对者”，虽然，如前所报道，许多国家的代表团也都反对这个提案中的若干项目。杜勒斯对苏联及其外交政策重复屡见不鲜的谩骂。杜勒斯一方面避不考虑七国提案的批评者、首先是苏联代表团所提出的法律上的论据，一方面又小心翼翼地特别躲避开宪章的第十一条第二款，根据这一款的规定，大会必须把所有应采取行动的问题提交安理会。他然后毫无根据地断言，七国提案中所包含的建议都充分符合联合国宪章和原则。他又同样毫无根据地宣称各国代表团反对把大会并不具有的权力，即提出关于必须采取行动以维持和平与安全之建议的权力，给予大会是不正确的。杜勒斯随后又恣意对安理会五个常任理事国一致的原则大肆例行的攻击。
    杜勒斯企图为七国提案中关于安理会任何七个理事国即可以召开大会特别会议的一节辩解。他说这一节并不抵触联合国宪章，他说召开特别会议乃是“程序”问题，因此可以由安理会任何七个理事国的简单多数票来决定。
    杜勒斯又说，七国提案的起草人愿意另外草拟一个提案，这个提案将包括其他各国代表团所提出的某些修正案，并且将“消除”在辩论设立集体行动委员会的建议时所产生的“疑惧”。
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基后来作了长篇发言，综述了一般辩论的结果。维辛斯基在发言中一开头就强调说，凡是真正相信联合国的任务和目标是防止新战争的威胁、加强和平，保证各国安全的人，对于现在正在讨论的问题都极为关心。
    维辛斯基在着重地指出目前讨论的问题的重要性之后指出，在长时间的重要的讨论过程中，大家对苏联代表团所提出的理由，它所提出的建议，以及它所认为需要赞成的建议曾给予足够的注意，这有助于加强和平与各国安全的伟大事业。维辛斯基在概括一般辩论的结果时，谈到玻利维亚代表的发言，并说它在形式上是粗暴的，不可容忍的，在本质上是嘲弄事实，是建筑在歪曲这些事实和伪造历史的基础上的。
    维辛斯基详细评论了七国提案起草人及其赞同者的发言。他批评了曾为这个提案辩护的美、英、法、加等国代表们的发言。后来，他也说明了苏联代表团对于在一般辩论过程中所谈到的关于所有主要问题的观点。维辛斯基的发言有相当大的一部分论述联合国宪章中所规定的安理会特权的法律基础，和安理会与联合国大会权能的划分。
    维辛斯基末了敦促政治委员会遵照联合国的基本原则并根据宪章的精神来决定现在正在考虑中的这个问题，以便有效地维持国际的和平与安全。
    大会聚精会神地听取了维辛斯基的演说。
    维辛斯基发言完毕后，主席宣布：在委员会下次集会时，七国提案的提案人将提出一项把在一般辩论进程中所提出的修正案与补充案以及智利提案中的各项建议都考虑在内的提案。
    政治委员会至此宣告休会，十月十四日晨再行集会。
