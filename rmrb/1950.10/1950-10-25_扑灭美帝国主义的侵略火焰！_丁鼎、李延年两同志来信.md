　　Extinguish the Flames of Aggression of American Imperialism!
　　Letters from Comrades Ding Ding and Li Yannian
　　I. Comrade Ding Ding's Letter
　　To the Editor:
　　The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is our friendly neighbor. During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the Korean people, with a great spirit of internationalism, fought alongside us, sharing weal and woe, until finally our common enemy—Japanese imperialism—was overthrown.
　　Now we are liberated. But our friendly neighbor—the Korean people—are suffering from the brutal aggression of American imperialism. Countless people are being massacred by the American and Li reactionary cliques, countless peaceful cities and villages are being bombed, and countless factories, institutions, schools, and hospitals are being frantically destroyed, leaving tens of thousands of people homeless! Recently, American imperialism has concentrated large armed forces, sparing no expense to occupy Seoul, and is continuing to expand its aggression more and more frantically, causing the people of North Korea, who had been living peaceful and happy lives since liberation, to suffer disaster again! Not only that, but American imperialism is also frantically provoking everywhere, bombing and strafing our peaceful cities and villages, and shelling our merchant ships, causing significant losses to the property of our people! The peace of our country and the entire Asia has been severely threatened, and we cannot sit idly by!
　　Reader Ding Ding

　　II. Comrade Li Yannian's Letter
　　To the Editor:
　　Since the American imperialists and their vassal states landed at Incheon Port in Korea with five hundred heavy bombers, three hundred warships, and more than forty thousand troops equipped with heavy artillery and tanks, the war-mongering American imperialists have unscrupulously expanded their aggressive atrocities more and more frantically. This shows that the purpose of American imperialism's aggression against Korea is not only to enslave all the Korean people, but also to use Korea as a base for aggression to further expand its aggression. Now the flames of aggression are about to burn to our country's borders, and all compatriots must be seriously vigilant. We should earnestly assist our invaded brother country and stop the crimes of the American fascist bandits. Brotherly countries such as Hungary and Poland have already extended a helping hand. We are so close, we cannot sit idly by.
　　Respectfully, Li Yannian

　　扑灭美帝国主义的侵略火焰！
    丁鼎、李延年两同志来信
    一、丁鼎同志来信编辑同志：
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，是我们的友邻。在八年抗日战争中，朝鲜人民曾抱着伟大的国际主义精神与我们并肩作战，同甘苦共患难，直到最后把我们的共同敌人——日本帝国主义打倒。
    现在我们解放了。但我们的友邻——朝鲜人民却遭受着美帝国主义的残暴侵略，无数人民被美、李反动派屠杀，无数和平城市和村庄被轰炸，无数工厂、机关、学校、医院遭到疯狂的破坏，成千上万的人民无家可归！最近美帝国主义又集中了大批武装力量，不惜任何代价侵占汉城，并日益疯狂地继续扩大侵略，使解放以后过着和平幸福生活的北朝鲜人民重新遭受灾难！不但如此，美帝国主义还在疯狂的到处挑衅，轰炸扫射我国和平城市及乡村；炮击我国商船，致使我国人民财产遭到重大损失！我国及整个亚洲的和平已经遭受到严重的威胁，我们不能坐视不顾！
          读者  丁鼎
    二、李延年同志来信编辑同志：
    自从美帝及其附庸国用五百架重轰炸机、三百只军舰和四万余配备有重炮坦克的兵力在朝鲜的仁川港登陆以来，美国战争贩子们肆无忌惮的扩大侵略的暴行更日益疯狂。这说明了美帝侵略朝鲜的目的，不仅要奴役全朝鲜的人民，而且要以朝鲜为侵略基地，更进一步扩大侵略。现在侵略的火焰快要烧到我国的边疆了，全国同胞必须严重警惕。我们应该切实援助我们被侵略的兄弟国家，制止美国法西斯强盗的罪行。匈牙利、波兰等兄弟国家已经伸出了援助的手，我们近在咫尺，不能坐视不理。
          读者  李延年敬上
