The Glory of Rural Young Women League Members
    Shi Changzhi

    I. "I was prepared long ago!"

    In Dayu Village, Second District, Baiyan County, Shandong Province, there is a woman named Feng Yonglan, 18 years old, who is a member of the Youth League. This year, during the summer harvest, her father fell ill, so Feng Yonglan threshed the grain and winnowed it herself. When the district called for the delivery of public grain, she used a dustpan to clean her family's due of 83 jin of public grain and delivered it to the granary, along with the 90-odd jin she was delivering for others, in the rain. Her actions were praised by the government. She was very happy when she returned home and hoed her two mu of sorghum and two mu of millet four times each, hoed the sweet potatoes twice, and the cotton six times; she also accumulated 34 loads of manure. Once, her father said to her with concern: "This year, everyone is fertilizing the wheat fields before sowing, what will our family do?" Feng Yonglan told her father, "I was prepared long ago." Her father was overjoyed. Under her influence, many people actively sowed the fields.

    II. "Don't hinder your daughter-in-law's progress!"

    Du Guiying of Guozhuang, Second District, Baiyan County, is 22 years old. Her husband has been in the army for many years. She has no mother-in-law and lives only with her father-in-law. The old man's thinking is very feudal, and he resolutely refuses to let her go out. She is depressed all day long. This spring, the village mobilized her to join the League, but the old man disagreed. She said to her father-in-law amiably: "Your son joined the army, and I also want to make progress and work hard in production. You are 55 years old, don't worry about me, watch my ambition!" Soon, she joined the League and was elected as the director of the village women's federation. From then on, she worked even harder in production. When the district held a meeting, the old man said to her unhappily: "How many meetings do you have to attend in a year? The family is very busy, and we have to find someone to help. We don't even have pancakes to eat!" Guiying said: "I'll think of a way!" She soaked the grain in the evening, got up in the middle of the night to grind it, and finished making pancakes and cooking before tomorrow. The old man thought, the education she received from the higher authorities is really good! His daughter-in-law used to never go out, but now, after two or three months of education, she has undergone a great transformation. This autumn's production is more than double that of last year. He said to Guiying: "Our family of two cultivated more than eight and a third mu of land, harvested about 900 jin last year, and more than 1,900 jin this year (not counting the sweet potatoes on one mu of land). You must make good progress." He often said to people: Don't hinder the progress of young daughters-in-law! When young people make progress, they can increase production.

　　农村女青年团员的光荣
    师长智
    一、“我早准备好了！”
    山东省白彦县二区大峪村有个妇女冯永兰，年十八岁，是青年团团员。今年夏收时，她父亲生病了，冯永兰便自己打场，扬粮食。区里号召交公粮了，她把自家应交的八十三斤公粮，用簸箕簸净以后，连同给别人捎去的九十来斤，冒雨送到粮库。她的行动得到了政府的表扬。她回家后很高兴，将二亩高粱、二亩谷子都锄了四遍，地瓜锄了两遍，棉花锄了六遍；又沤粪三十四挑。有一次，她父亲担心地对她说：“今年，人家都耩麦上粪，咱家怎么办呢？”冯永兰告诉她父亲说：“我早准备好了。”她父亲喜的了不得。在她的影响下，不少的人都积极地耩地。
    二、“不要阻碍儿媳妇进步！”
    白彦县二区郭庄杜贵英同志，现年二十二岁，丈夫已参军多年。没有婆婆，她只与公公过日子。老头的思想很封建，坚决不让她出门。她整天苦闷着。今年春天村中动员她入团，老头不同意。她和霭地对她公公说：“你儿参了军，我也要进步，努力生产。你老人家五十五岁啦，你不要为我操心，看我的志气吧！”不久，她参加了团，并被选为本村妇联主任。从此，她对生产就格外努力了。区里开会时，老头很不高兴地对她说：“一年要开多少次会呢？家中怪忙的，还得找人帮助，咱管饭没有煎饼啦！”贵英就说：“我来想办法吧！”她便在晚上泡上粮食，半夜起来推磨，不等明天就摊完煎饼做好饭。老头一想，上级对她的教育真好！儿媳过去不出门，现在经过两三个月的教育，大有转变了。今秋比去年增产多一倍。他对贵英说：“俺爷儿俩，种八亩三分多地，去年收九百来斤，今年收了一千九百多斤（一亩地的地瓜不算）。你要好好进步。”他并时常对人们说：不要阻碍青年儿媳进步！年轻人进步了，就能增加生产。
