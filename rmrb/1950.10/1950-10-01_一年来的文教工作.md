　　One Year of Cultural and Educational Work
    Guo Moruo
    The specific tasks of cultural and educational work today are mainly to "eliminate feudal, comprador, and fascist ideologies, and develop ideas that serve the people," expand the popularization of culture and education to improve the cultural life of the working people, strengthen the close cooperation between cultural, educational, scientific, and health undertakings and economic construction departments, and cultivate a large number of worker-peasant cadres and construction talents, and systematically and plannedly reform the old cultural and educational content and system.

    Through the efforts of comrades in various fields over the past year, we have already achieved some initial gains. Among these gains, the most significant is that the people's political and cultural level has been significantly improved through the nationwide mass learning movement. This learning movement is the movement that Chairman Mao pointed out in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" to "educate and transform ourselves on a national scale and on an overall scale using democratic methods." After the successive liberation of various parts of the country, political studies for workers, peasants, and intellectuals were launched one after another. In various cities and rural areas that have undergone land reform, large-scale vocational and amateur supplementary schools were established, and winter school movements were launched. According to preliminary statistics, more than 700,000 workers in various places have participated in vocational and amateur supplementary schools, and about 10 million peasants have participated in winter school learning, of which 3 million have transferred to regular people's schools. Major universities and middle schools have universally established political courses; faculty and staff of all sizes have also universally organized learning. Various agencies have also organized learning committees and established a learning system for on-the-job cadres. Political training universities and political training classes have been established in various places to conduct ideological reform education. As of the first half of this year, according to incomplete statistics, 470,000 people have participated in this type of learning.

    In order to promote this work, over the past year, the government's cultural and educational departments' literary and artistic propaganda work, news and broadcasting education work, science and cultural relics exhibition work, book publication and distribution work, and local and military cultural work troupe activities have all cooperated with this movement and played a great role in promoting it. Let us briefly describe the main work of each department as follows:

    In terms of education, the curriculum of the old universities and colleges has been reformed cautiously and step by step, and a decision on the reform of the curriculum of universities and colleges has been promulgated, opposing the tendency of dogmatism divorced from reality and preventing the tendency of narrow pragmatism or empiricism that despises theory. We are preparing to gradually complete this reform work within three years, so that the higher education of the whole country can effectively meet the needs of national construction. Secondly, in order to open up universities and colleges to worker-peasant cadres and worker-peasant youths, we have absorbed the experience of the Soviet Union and combined it with our country's reality to establish some new types of universities and colleges. There are already 21 completely new types, and 11 are being transformed from old types of universities and colleges. Together, they account for more than 15% of the total number of universities and colleges in the country, and the students account for more than 21% of the total number of university students in the country. In terms of primary and secondary schools, in areas that have undergone land reform, the number has greatly exceeded the period of reactionary rule, and the composition of students has also changed. For example, the number of middle school students in Northeast China this year has increased by more than 160% compared with the period of enemy and puppet rule, and the number of primary school students has increased by more than 71%; among primary and secondary school students, children of workers and peasants have accounted for the majority. In order to specifically educate worker-peasant cadres and youths, so that they can obtain the cultural level of secondary schools in a relatively short period of time and be able to enter universities for further study, we have established worker-peasant rapid middle schools. There are currently 18 such new types of middle schools that have been established, and 10 are being established (excluding the military). Recently, the National Education Department of the Central Committee held a meeting on worker-peasant education and decided to establish a large number of amateur schools for workers and peasants and worker-peasant cultural supplementary schools that are separated from production for specialized study.

    In terms of health work, we have determined the general policy of prevention first, and make health undertakings face the working people. The main tasks are epidemic prevention, health care, the establishment of grass-roots health institutions, and the training of health cadres. There are now 1,329 county-level health centers and institutes in the country; we are preparing to universally establish county-level health centers in all counties across the country within three to five years, and gradually establish district health centers in each district under the county. Preparations are now being made to establish various intermediate and primary medical schools in various places next year to train the required cadres. Regarding epidemic prevention and health care work, the following important tasks have been done in the past year. (1) In the disaster areas with 40 million people and the severely affected areas with 10 million people, preventive injections and lice-killing showers were carried out, curbing the epidemic in the disaster areas and reducing the suffering of migrant workers in the disaster areas. (2) In order to promote the anti-tuberculosis movement, it is planned to vaccinate 480,000 people with BCG vaccine, and 185,000 people have been vaccinated. (3) Preventive work has been carried out for infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, typhus and cholera. The Central Health Department alone has issued 22.4 million doses of various vaccines. According to incomplete statistics, 12 million people have been vaccinated. (4) Plague prevention and control stations, epidemic prevention stations and quarantine stations have been established in various plague-prone areas, and epidemic prevention teams have been dispatched to carry out prevention and control. The plague outbreaks in Chahar-Mongolia, southern Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Yunnan and other regions last winter and this year have been quickly extinguished, and prevention and control are underway in Heilongjiang, Songjiang and other places; the number of plague deaths has been greatly reduced. (5) To prevent the spread of smallpox, approximately 40 million people have been vaccinated with cowpox this year, setting a new record for smallpox vaccination in our country. In the Dalian-Lushun area, the number of people vaccinated this spring accounted for 87.8% of the total population, so that there was not a single smallpox patient in the area this year. We are also preparing to vaccinate 100 million people next year, and expect to completely eliminate smallpox in our country within three to five years.

    In terms of scientific research, we have completed the adjustment and reorganization of the old scientific research institutions. The Chinese Academy of Sciences now has 15 research institutes, one astronomical observatory, one engineering experiment hall, and three research institute preparatory offices, totaling 20 units. The research work focuses on science and engineering, earth sciences, and biological experimental sciences. Among them, the research of science and engineering focuses on matching industrial and national defense construction, and the research in biology focuses on matching agricultural construction. In addition, attention is paid to science popularization work. In addition to the government's special agency to guide this work, the National Science Popularization Work Association was established at the National Scientists Congress this year to assist the government in promoting this work.

    In terms of news work, the main thing is to improve the work of newspapers, strengthen the role of news work in serving economic construction, and launch criticism and self-criticism through newspapers, which has played a great role in improving, supervising, and inspecting the work of various departments, and has also greatly improved the prestige of newspapers among readers. In order to strengthen the educational role of newspapers for the masses, reading groups and worker-peasant correspondents have been greatly developed in various places. Newspapers in various places have also improved their management and editing methods. Some newspapers have also implemented a system of distribution through post offices, which has increased the sales of newspapers and reduced the cost of newspapers. Therefore, some major newspapers have achieved self-sufficiency. The second is the development of broadcasting. There are now 55 people's broadcasting stations in the country; one of them is an international broadcasting station, broadcasting to foreign countries in 12 different languages. Twenty-four provinces and four administrative offices in the country have established or are establishing radio networks.

    In terms of publishing, a total of more than 95 million copies of books were published nationwide in the first half of this year. There were 172 kinds of periodicals, with a total of more than 14.4 million copies. The sales volume of each book has greatly increased compared with before liberation: the average annual sales volume of ordinary books is 5,000 to 10,000 copies, and the sales volume of popular readings and cadre learning books is 50,000 to 100,000 copies (before liberation, the average annual sales volume of ordinary books was only 2,000 to 3,000 copies). In order to strengthen publishing and distribution work, we have now decided to unify the distribution work of Xinhua Bookstores across the country, and implement the division of labor between state bookstores' publishing and distribution systems, and establish various specialized state-owned publishing houses.

    In the film industry, our basic policy is to gradually eliminate poisonous films of imperialism, strengthen the educational role of people's films, and make films penetrate into the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers. In the reactionary period, British and American films seized more than 70% of the Chinese market. Over the past year, thanks to the efforts of state-owned and private film industries in our country, this situation has basically changed. Taking Shanghai, where American films were the most popular in the past, as an example, American films used to account for 75% of all viewers, but in June this year, it has dropped to 28.3%. This is a major victory in the film industry in our country. In addition, in order to expand the popularization of films, we have trained 1,800 projection team members, and are preparing to establish 700 projection teams across the country next year.

    In addition, a lot of work has been done in literature, art, and drama, and the work of transforming old art, especially the reform of opera, has been carried out universally.

    In addition to the above, we have also paid special attention to the following issues: First, to carry out the construction of cultural and educational work for ethnic minorities, in order to eliminate the residual influence of Great Han chauvinism in the past reactionary rule era and promote cultural exchanges between brotherly ethnic groups. For this purpose, the Central People's Government sent two central visiting delegations to visit ethnic minority areas in the southwest and northwest, and were warmly welcomed by the people of ethnic minorities. In the cultural and educational undertakings of ethnic minorities, our focus is on developing education and health work. We have already established several colleges in Xinjiang, Lanzhou and other places, and are preparing to establish a national college in Beijing. In terms of health, we are planning to develop medical institutions and supply medicines, and have also developed newspapers and broadcasting services for ethnic minorities.

    Secondly, it is the issue of adjusting the public-private relationship in cultural and educational undertakings. In this regard, in addition to assisting private cultural and educational undertakings to transform their work content and providing appropriate investment or loans in economic terms, we also pay attention to the appropriate division of labor between public and private cultural and educational undertakings according to the policy of giving consideration to both public and private interests, in order to practice the principle of division of labor and cooperation, each doing its best. This issue has been studied in detail at several news, publishing, health, film and other professional conferences. In the practice of the above-mentioned departments, some good results have also been received.

    Finally, it is about the work of relieving unemployed intellectuals and dealing with out-of-school students. The State Council has issued an "Instruction on Relieving Unemployed Teachers and Dealing with the Problem of Out-of-School Students" and allocated a sum of money to solve the difficulties of unemployed teachers and out-of-school students in various places. Therefore, the serious phenomenon of teacher unemployment in various places has basically stopped developing in the second half of this year.

    The above is some of the main work in cultural education in the past year. Through the efforts of the past year, some major changes have taken place in the cultural life of our people. The people of the whole country, especially the working class and peasants, have strengthened their sense of being the masters of the new China, improved their understanding of the peace and democracy camp and the aggression camp, and established the view that labor creates civilization. These gains are specifically reflected in the spirit of self-sacrifice and class love shown by workers in various places in overcoming economic difficulties and relieving unemployment, and the enthusiasm and creativity shown in production competitions and new record movements; reflected in the efforts of peasants in various places to increase production and actively hand over public grain; reflected in the enthusiasm and efforts of intellectuals and government workers in learning, work and construction; reflected in the warm and resolute opposition of the people of the whole country to American imperialist aggression and support for peace; reflected in the unprecedented increase in the cultural and educational requirements of the working class and peasants. All these are unprecedented events in Chinese history. This shows that the culture and education of the new China have changed in essence.

    Of course, this is only the starting point of the construction of new democratic culture and education, the first step of a long march. Our future tasks are still very arduous, but our future is infinitely bright.

　　一年来的文教工作
    郭沫若
    文教工作的具体任务，在今天主要是“肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想，发展为人民服务的思想”扩大文化教育的普及，以提高劳动人民的文化生活，加强文化教育科学卫生事业与经济建设部门的密切配合，并培养大批工农干部与建设人才，有步骤有计划地进行对旧的文化教育内容与制度的改革。
    经过了一年来各方面工作同志的努力我们已经获得了一些初步的收获。在这些收获中间，最为显著的，即是经过全国规模的群众学习运动，人民的政治文化水平是显著的提高了。这个学习运动，即是毛主席在“论人民民主专政”中所指出的“全国范围和全体规模上用民主的方法教育自己和改造自己”的运动。全国各地相继解放以后，都纷纷展开了工人农民和知识分子的政治学习。在各地城市及经过土改的农村，大规模的创办了职工业余补习学校，展开了冬学运动。据初步统计，各地参加职工业余补习学校的工人已达七十余万人，参加冬学学习的农民约有一千余万人，其中转入常年民校的有三百万人。各大中学校都普遍设立了政治课；大中小学教职员也普遍地组织了学习。各机关也都组织了学委会，建立了在职干部的学习制度。各地都设立了政治训练大学和政治训练班，进行思想改造教育，今年上半年止，据不完全统计参加此种学习的已达四十七万人。
    为了推进此项工作，一年来，政府文教部门的文学艺术的宣传工作、新闻广播的教育工作、科学和文物的展览工作、书刊的出版与发行工作、地方和部队的文工团的活动，都配合了这个运动，尽了很大的推动作用。我们且将各部门的主要工作分述如下：
    在教育工作方面，对旧有高等学校课程进行了谨慎而有步骤的改革，颁布了关于高等学校课程改革的决定，反对脱离实际的教条主义倾向和防止轻视理论的狭隘的实用主义或经验主义的倾向。我们准备在三年之内逐步完成这项改革的工作，使全国的高等教育切实做到配合国家建设的需要。其次，为了使高等学校向工农干部与工农青年开门，我们吸收了苏联的经验并结合我国的实际，建立了一些新型的高等学校。完全新型的已有二十一所，正由旧型高等学校转变过来的有十一所。共占全国高等学校总数的百分之十五以上，学生占全国大学生总数的百分之二十一以上。中小学方面，在经过土改的地区，在数量上已大大超过反动统治时期，在学生成份上也已经发生变化。例如东北今年的中学生人数已较敌伪统治时期增加了百分之一百六十以上，小学生人数增加了百分之七十一以上；在中小学生里面，工农子弟都已经占了大多数。为了专门教育工农干部和青年，使他们在较短期间获得中等学校的文化水平，能够升入大学深造，我们创办了工农速成中学，这种新型中学目前已经成立有十八所，正在创办中的尚有十所（部队除外）。最近中央教育部召开的工农教育会议中并决定了大量创办工人、农民的业余学校和脱离生产专门学习的工农文化补习学校。
    在卫生工作方面，我们确定了预防为主的总方针，并使卫生事业面向劳动人民。主要工作是防疫、保健、建立基层卫生机构和培养卫生干部。现在全国已有县卫生院所一三二九所；我们已准备在三至五年之内在全国各县普遍建立县卫生院，并逐步在县下各区建立区卫生所。现已准备于明年在各地创办各种中级和初级医事学校，培养所需的干部。关于防疫和保健工作，一年来做了有如下几项重要工作。（一）在四千万人的灾区和一千万人的重灾区，进行了预防注射及灭虱淋浴工作，遏止了灾区的疫病流行，减少了灾区民工的病苦。（二）为了推广防痨运动，计划接种卡介苗四十八万人，现已接种十八万五千人。（三）进行了伤寒、斑疹寒伤和霍乱等传染病的预防工作，仅中央卫生部已发出各种疫苗二千二百四十万人份，据不完全的统计，现已注射了一千二百万人。（四）在各鼠疫发生地区建立了鼠疫防治所、防疫站和检疫站，并派出防疫队，进行防治，今年及去冬曾发生鼠疫之察蒙、粤南、福建、浙江、云南等地区均已迅速扑灭，黑龙江、松江等地则正在进行防治；鼠疫死亡人数已较前大大减少。（五）防止天花流行，今年已接种牛痘约四千万人，创造了我国种痘数字的新纪录。在旅大地区，今春种痘的人数占全部人口的百分之八十七点八，使该地今年完全没有一个天花的病人。我们并准备在明年种痘一万万人，预期在三至五年之内完全扑灭了我国的天花。
    科学研究方面，我们已经完成了旧有科学研究机构的调整和改组。现中国科学院有十五个研究所、一个天文台、一个工学实验馆和三个研究所筹备处，共二十个单位。研究工作以理工科学，地学科学和生物实验科学为中心。其中理工科学的研究着重于配合工业和国防建设，生物方面的研究则着重于配合农业建设。此外并注重科学普及工作，除政府有专设机构指导此项工作外，今年全国科学家代表大会上又成立了全国的科学普及工作协会，协助政府推进此项工作。
    在新闻工作方面，主要是改进了报纸的工作，加强了新闻工作服务经济建设的作用，和通过报纸展开了批评和自我批评，这对于各部门的工作的改进督促和检查上都发生了很大的作用，同时也大大提高了报纸在读者中的威信。为了加强报纸对群众的教育作用，各地大量发展了读报组和工农通讯员。各地报纸并改进了管理和编辑方法，若干报纸还实施了经由邮局发行的制度，提高了报纸的销路，减低了报纸的成本，因此使若干主要报纸达到了自给自足的地步。其次是发展了广播事业现在全国已有五十五座人民广播台；其中有一座为国际广播台，用十二种不同的语言向国外进行广播。全国已有二十四省和四个行署建立了或正在建立收音网。
    在出版工作方面，今年上半年，全国的出版书籍共计九千五百万余册。期刊一百七十二种，共一千四百余万册。每种书籍的销数较解放前已大为增加：普通书籍平均年销五千至一万册，通俗读物和干部学习书籍五万至十万册（解放以前普通书籍平均每年仅销二三千册）。为了加强出版和发行工作，现在我们已经决定了统一全国新华书店的发行工作，并实行国家书店出版与发行的分工制度，成立各种专业化的国营出版社。
    在电影事业方面，我们的基本方针是逐步肃清帝国主义的有毒影片，加强人民电影的教育作用，并使电影深入工农兵大众。在反动时期，英美影片夺占了我国百分之七十以上的市场。一年来，由于我国国营和私营电影事业的努力，这种形势已经基本改变了。以过去美国影片最为风行的上海为例，美国影片的观众过去曾占全部观众的百分之七十五，今年六月份却已降到百分之二十八点三。这是我国电影事业上的一大胜利。此外为了扩大电影的普及，我们已经训练了一千八百名放映队员，准备明年在全国成立七百个放映队。
    此外在文学艺术戏剧方面，都做了不少的工作，并普遍进行了改造旧艺术工作，特别是戏曲改革的工作。
    除以上所述之外，我们还特别注意到下列几个问题：第一是开展少数民族文化教育的建设工作，以期肃清过去反动统治时代的大汉族主义的残留影响，促进兄弟民族间的文化交流。为此目的，中央人民政府派遣了两个中央访问团分赴西南、西北少数民族地区进行访问，获得少数民族人民热烈的欢迎。在少数民族的文教事业上，我们的重点是发展教育与卫生工作。我们已经在新疆兰州等处创办了若干学院并着手在北京成立一个民族学院。卫生方面正在计划发展医疗机构和供应药品，此外并发展了为少数民族人民服务的报纸和广播工作。
    其次，是调整文教事业的公私关系问题。在这方面，我们根据公私兼顾的政策除了协助私营文教事业改造其工作内容和在经济上予以适当的投资或贷款外，并注意于公私文教事业的适当分工，以实践分工合作各得其所的原则。在几次新闻、出版、卫生、电影和其他专业会议上都详细研究了这个问题。在上述各部门事业的实践中间，也已经收到了若干良好的效果。
    最后，是关于救济失业知识分子和处理失学学生的工作。政务院已经发布了一个“关于救济失业教师与处理失学学生问题的指示”，并拨出一笔经费解决各地失业教师与失学学生的困难，因此今年下半年各地教师失业的严重现象已经大体上停止了进展。
    以上是一年来文化教育方面的一些主要工作。经过这一年来的努力，我们的人民文化生活已经产生了一些重大的变化。全国人民，特别是工农大众，已经增强了自己的新中国主人翁的感觉，提高了对于和平民主阵营与侵略阵营的认识，树立了劳动创造文明的观点。这些收获具体反映在各地工人在克服经济困难和救济失业上所表现的自我牺牲与阶级友爱的精神，在生产竞赛和新纪录运动上所表现的积极性和创造性；反映在各地农民在生产上的加紧和交纳公粮的踊跃；反映在知识分子及政府工作人员对学习工作和建设工作的热心和努力；反映在全国人民反对美帝侵略和拥护和平的热烈坚决；反映在工农大众对于文化教育要求的空前提高。所有这些都是中国历史上前所未有的事情。这说明新中国的文化教育在本质上已经起了变化。
    当然，这还只是新民主主义的文化教育的建设的起点，万里长征的第一步。我们未来的任务还非常艰巨，但我们的前途是有无限光明的。
