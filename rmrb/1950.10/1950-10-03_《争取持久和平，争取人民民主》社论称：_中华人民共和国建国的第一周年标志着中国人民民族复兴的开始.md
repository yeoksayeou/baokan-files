Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: According to the Romanian News Agency Bucharest: The editorial in the 39th issue (total 99th issue) of the newspaper "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" published in Bucharest on September 29th, discusses the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The editorial first pointed out the great historical significance of the victory of the Chinese revolution, and then wrote: The first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China marks the beginning of the national rejuvenation of the Chinese people. The Chinese people have made many achievements in this year, which is the beginning of a greater transformation. A treaty of friendship, alliance, and mutual assistance has been concluded between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, confirming the permanent friendship between the two great nations. Soviet-Chinese friendship has become a major factor in the struggle of all peoples for peace and against warmongers. Within a year, relying on the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China has stabilized its economic life: inflation has stopped. Thousands of enterprises and railways have been restored. The foundations of a planned economy are being laid. The situation of the working class has been greatly improved. Many industrial enterprises have launched production competitions, and labor productivity is constantly improving. Agriculture is advancing. Large-scale irrigation projects have begun, and the struggle against natural disasters has been successfully launched. This year's harvest is much better than last year's. This is because land reform has been completed in an area with an agricultural population of about 145 million, and in other areas, the People's Government is reducing tax rates and rents for poor and middle peasants, doing everything possible to help them. In the provinces liberated last year, thorough preparations for land reform are being made.

The editorial pointed out that China is led and guided by the glorious Chinese Communist Party—the fighting vanguard of the working class.

The editorial continued: For decades, China has been constantly involved in bloody wars, which have weakened the strength of the great Chinese people. Now the new democratic government is making every effort to strengthen peace, because only under peaceful conditions can China carry out socialist construction. The Chinese people have experienced the hardships and difficulties of various wars. They are ardent advocates of peace. More than 100 million Chinese people have signed the Stockholm Appeal. Today, China has become a solid and powerful fortress in the international peace and democracy camp.

　　《争取持久和平，争取人民民主》社论称：
    中华人民共和国建国的第一周年标志着中国人民民族复兴的开始
    【新华社一日讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特讯：九月二十九日在布加勒斯特出版的《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》报第三十九号（总第九十九期）社论，论述中华人民共和国建国一周年纪念。
    社论首先指出中国革命胜利的伟大历史意义，接着写道：中华人民共和国建国的第一周年标志着中国人民民族复兴的开始。中国人民在这一年里已取得许多成就，成为更伟大的转变的开端。苏联和中华人民共和国之间，已订立一项友好同盟互助条约，确定了两大民族之间的永久友谊。苏中友谊已成为各族人民为争取和平与反对战争贩子的斗争中的主要的因素。在一年以内，倚靠着苏联的兄弟援助，中华人民共和国已稳定了它的经济生活：通货膨胀已经停止。成千的企业和铁道已经恢复。计划经济的基础正在奠定。工人阶级的状况已经大大改善。许多工业企业已展开了生产竞赛，劳动生产率在不断地提高。农业在前进中。大规模的灌溉工程已经动工，和天灾的斗争已成功地展开了。本年的收成比去年好得多。这是因为在一片拥有农业人口约一亿四千五百万的土地上，已经完成了土地改革，而在其余的地区，人民政府正在减低贫农和中农的税率和地租，尽一切办法帮助他们。在去年解放的省份里，正在作土地改革的周密准备工作。
    社论指出中国是由光荣的中国共产党——工人阶级战斗的先锋队——起领导和指导作用的。
    社论继称：数十年以来，中国经常地被牵连在血腥的战争里，这些接二连三的战争削弱了中国伟大的人民的力量。现在新的民主政府正在不遗余力地加强和平，因为只有在和平的条件下，中国才能够进行社会主义的建设。中国人民经历了各种战争的艰难困苦。他们是热烈的和平拥护者。有一亿以上的中国人民签署了斯德哥尔摩宣言。中国今天已经成为国际和平民主阵线的一个稳固而强大的堡垒。
