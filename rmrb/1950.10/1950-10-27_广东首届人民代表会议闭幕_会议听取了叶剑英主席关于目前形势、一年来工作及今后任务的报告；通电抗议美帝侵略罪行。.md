Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd—The first Guangdong Provincial People's Representative Conference of All Circles was held from the 5th to the 16th. A total of 837 representatives from all walks of life in the province, compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau, overseas Chinese, and representatives of the Miao, Yao, and Li ethnic groups attended. The central task of this conference was to summarize the work of the past year and discuss future work guidelines.

The conference heard Chairman Ye Jianying of the Provincial People's Government report on the current situation, one year's work, and future tasks, Vice Chairman Fang Fang's report on land reform work in the province, and responsible cadres of various units of the Provincial People's Government on the province's democratic construction, military, financial and economic, agriculture, forestry and water conservancy, culture and education, judicial, public security, and overseas Chinese affairs work over the past year. After in-depth discussions on the above reports, all the representatives unanimously agreed and made resolutions.

In his report, Chairman Ye Jianying pointed out that Guangdong Province had made considerable achievements in various tasks over the past year. In terms of military and public security work, bandits throughout the province have been basically eliminated, and social order has become more stable than before. In terms of financial and economic work, certain achievements have been made in rectifying taxation, collecting public grain, saving expenses, adjusting industry and commerce, providing relief to unemployed workers, and promoting exchange between urban and rural areas. As a result, with the concerted efforts of the people across the country, financial stability and price stability have been achieved, difficulties have been overcome, and production has been supported. In terms of democratic reform and democratic construction, the rent reduction movement and production for famine relief work have also achieved certain results. People's representative conferences or farmer representative conferences have been held in most cities, counties, districts, and townships throughout the province. Grassroots masses in urban and rural areas have been initially organized. At present, there are more than 2,190,000 members of farmers' associations in the province (excluding Hainan, the Xijiang District, and the suburbs of Shantou City), more than 150,000 members of trade unions, and more than 100,000 militiamen. Democratic power has been established in 2,587 of the 3,182 townships in the province.

Next, Chairman Ye Jianying analyzed some shortcomings in the work. He pointed out that because some cadres did not have sufficient understanding of the domestic and international situation, they did not do enough to unite all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal forces to carry out work. On the other hand, they were not vigilant enough about the activities of counter-revolutionaries, resulting in a "boundless leniency" bias. Secondly, the work style of bureaucracy and commandism exists to varying degrees among cadres at all levels, hindering the better connection between the People's Government and the people. These bad styles must be resolutely overcome in the future.

Regarding the province's central tasks in the future, Chairman Ye Jianying put forward the following three major tasks: First, this winter, land reform will be started in Longchuan, Jieyang, and Xingning counties, with a total population of 2 million, where conditions are ripe. Land reform will be steadily completed throughout the province in about three years. In areas where land reform has not yet been implemented, rent reduction work will be carried out, and water conservancy will be vigorously developed to restore and develop agricultural production. Second, continue to adjust industry and commerce, strengthen the link between urban and rural trade – the work of market towns, control domestic and foreign ports to facilitate exchange between urban and rural areas and at home and abroad, so as to restore and develop the production of large and small cities throughout the province in a focused manner. Third, do a good job in organizing fishermen along the river, strengthen the management of islands; fully mobilize the masses of people in urban and rural areas, resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary activities, and strictly prevent sabotage activities by imperialists and remnants of the Kuomintang bandit secret agents, so as to consolidate public security and national defense.

At the meeting, the representatives unanimously signed the peace declaration and unanimously passed a telegram to the United Nations General Assembly and the World Peace Congress, protesting against the crimes of US imperialism in invading China, Korea, and other Asian countries.

The meeting elected Ye Jianying, Fang Fang, Li Zhangda and other 81 people as members of the Guangdong Provincial People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee.

　　广东首届人民代表会议闭幕
    会议听取了叶剑英主席关于目前形势、一年来工作及今后任务的报告；通电抗议美帝侵略罪行。
    【新华社广州二十二日电】广东省首届各界人民代表会议已于五日至十六日举行。出席全省各界人民、港澳同胞、海外华侨及苗族、徭族、黎族等代表共八百三十七人。这次会议的中心任务是：总结过去一年来的工作和讨论今后的工作方针。
    会议听取了省人民政府叶剑英主席关于目前形势、一年来的工作和今后任务的报告，方方副主席关于本省土地改革工作报告以及省人民政府各单位负责干部关于一年来该省民主建政、军事、财经、农林水利、文教、司法、公安、华侨事务等工作报告。会议对上述各项报告进行了深入的讨论后，全体代表一致同意，并作成了决议。
    叶剑英主席在报告中指出：一年来，广东省的各项工作都取得了不少成绩。在军事和公安工作方面，全省土匪已基本肃清，社会秩序已较前更为安定。财经工作方面，在整顿税收、征收公粮、节约开支、调整工商业、救济失业工人、促进城乡内外交流等工作上，均获得一定的成绩，因而在与全国人民一致努力下，稳定了金融物价，克服了困难和扶助了生产。在民主改革和民主建政方面，开展了减租运动和生产度荒工作，也获得了一定成绩。全省大部分市、县、区、乡已开过各界人民代表会议或农民代表会议。城乡基层群众已初步组织起来，目前全省计有农会会员二百一十九万余人（缺海南、西江区及汕头市郊区）、工会会员十五万余人、民兵十余万人。全省三千一百八十二个乡中，已有二千五百八十七个乡建立了民主政权。
    接着，叶剑英主席分析了工作中的一些缺点。他指出：由于部分工作干部对于国内外的形势没有足够的认识，因而，对于团结一切反帝反封建的力量来进行工作，做得不够；另一方面，又表现在对反革命分子活动的警惕不够，产生了“宽大无边”的偏向。其次，官僚主义和命令主义的工作作风在各级干部中都或多或少地存在着，阻碍了人民政府与人民群众更好地联系。这些不良作风，今后要坚决加以克服。
    关于该省今后的中心工作，叶剑英主席提出以下三大任务：一，今冬在条件均已成熟的龙川、揭阳、兴宁三县共二百万人口的地区，开始进行土地改革；在大约三年的时间内，稳步完成全省土地改革工作。在还未实行土地改革的地区，则贯彻进行减租工作，同时大力兴修水利，以恢复与发展农业生产。二，继续调整工商业，加强城乡贸易的纽带——墟镇工作，掌握内外港口，以沟通城乡内外交流，达到有重点地恢复和发展全省各大小城市的生产事业。三，做好沿河渔民组织工作，加强海岛管理；充分发动城乡人民群众，坚决镇压反革命活动，严防帝国主义和国民党残余匪帮特务分子的破坏活动，以巩固治安与国防。
    会上，代表们一致在和平宣言书上签了名，并全体通过致电联合国大会及世界保卫和平大会，抗议美帝国主义侵略中国、朝鲜及亚洲其他国家的罪行。
    会议选出叶剑英、方方、李章达等八十一人为广东省首届各界人民代表会议协商委员会委员。
