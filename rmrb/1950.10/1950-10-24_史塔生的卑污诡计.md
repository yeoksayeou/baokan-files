　　Stassen's Despicable Tricks
    Weiketuoluofu
   [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th] "Truth Daily" published an article by Weiketuoluofu entitled "Stassen's Despicable Tricks". The full text is as follows:
   As the date of the US Congressional elections approaches, the election activities of the leaders of the two main parties of the US bourgeoisie – the Democratic and Republican parties – become more intense. Stassen, one of the leaders of the US Republican Party, is launching feverish activities. Until now, Stassen has had to be content with the title of President of the University of Pennsylvania. However, he is clearly determined to seek much higher positions. It should be recalled that in 1948 Stassen was one of the Republican presidential candidates, but he failed in his campaign, and now he is extremely active in his party's campaign, apparently intending to use this campaign to raise political capital.
   Humility is certainly not one of Stassen's virtues. On the contrary, the degree of arrogance and eagerness for self-promotion that Stassen possesses seems blatant even in the American political exchange. And in the serious days of the election campaign, he certainly did not forget the point that all American manuals point out, that is, he is one of the few American political figures who has personally met with Stalin.
   On October 4, Stassen clamored loudly and declared at a press conference that after consulting with Dulles and General Eisenhower, he had written a letter to Stalin, saying that he expressed his willingness to meet with Stalin in the letter, with the aim of trying to "prevent a quiet slide into war."
   When Stassen made such a statement, he apparently estimated the sentiments of the broad masses of American voters, who were deeply alarmed by the aggressive direction of the policies pursued by the American ruling group, the unprecedented arms expansion movement, and the preparations for a new war. Stassen understood that the American people craved peace, so he decided to quickly put on the mask of a "peacemaker." However, this mask does not fit the face of this universally recognized warmonger, who is notorious for being among the supporters of the most unscrupulous aggressive direction of American foreign policy.
   The entire content of Stassen's letter clearly shows that this is just a campaign tactic, and a clumsy one, which is seen through at a glance. It is no wonder that Stassen repeatedly failed and exposed his own despicable tricks.
   From the first few lines of Stassen's letter, it can be clearly seen that he has no friendship with facts, and even basic truthfulness is incompatible with him.
   For example, he arbitrarily said at the beginning that everything he said about the United States when he talked to Stalin in 1947 had proven to be correct and accurate. In fact, this is just empty and hypocritical rhetoric.
   Let us recall: In 1947, Stassen arbitrarily said that it was possible to stabilize the number of "highly employed" people in the United States, and arbitrarily said that in the United States, what dominates is adjusted rather than monopolistic capitalism. However, people all over the world know very well that the number of fully unemployed and semi-unemployed people in the United States is 18 million. This is the truth about the "high employment" that Stassen said. As for "adjusted rather than monopolistic capitalism," a vivid proof of Stassen's "proposition" is the fact that, according to Associated Press statistics, the total profits of the 450 largest monopoly companies increased by 43% in the second quarter of this year compared with the second quarter of last year. Finally, wasn't Stassen himself still issuing hysterical cries in his most recent speech, which he delivered on August 15, saying that the "inflation fever" in the United States must be extinguished immediately? So, what kind of economy is the "sound economy" of the United States that he wrote in his letter?
   However, these are just despicable distortions in Stassen's letter. The further content of this advertising text completely exposes the methods used by Stassen and his gang of shameless political speculators, and exposes the true goals of those warmongers who are very clumsy in disguising themselves with cheap, clamoring, and pretended peace-loving rhetoric.
   In his letter, Stassen demands nothing less than that the Soviet Union change its policy.
   It is not difficult for people to see that Stassen's arrogant demand is not only barbaric, but also very ridiculous. This demand makes it impossible for people to take any serious attitude towards the "document" jointly planned by the President of the University of Pennsylvania and the stubborn warmongers Dulles and Eisenhower.
   Stassen fully understands that his demands are absurd. Yes, this is the real goal of his attempt—to make clearly impossible demands in order to cause an uproar, saying that the Soviet Union is "stubborn and unyielding," and in this way, to open up a path for further and even more aggressive policies of the American ruling class, of which Stassen is one of the supporters.
   This is the true intention of Stassen's despicable trick.
   Stassen desperately tries to "rationalize" his absurd demands, without hesitation indulging in distortion of facts, malicious slander, fabrication, and futilely calling black white. The reason he does these things is to try to shift the responsibility for the current international situation to the Soviet Union.
   However, the facts are unbreakable. They have already refuted Stassen ruthlessly. The whole world knows that the main reason for the current international tension is the aggressive policy of the American ruling class. They are carrying out bloody intervention in Korea, intensifying the arms expansion movement, rushing to create aggressive blocs, overturning the basic principles of the United Nations organization, and rejecting all measures aimed at consolidating peace. When Stassen declares that the Soviet Union's consistent policy of seeking an early peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is "incompatible" with the struggle for peace, and insists that the United States' continued intervention in the Korean people is the way to "reach peace," he is only exposing himself.
   There is no need to list all of Stassen's lies one by one. These lies can be found in any newspaper of the Hearst system. But what Stassen said here can represent their characteristics. He adopted this method to try to rationalize the aggressive policy of American imperialism, especially its arms race. Stassen proclaimed in his letter in a militaristic and exaggerated tone that the United States could compete with the Soviet Union in rearming for ten years, or twenty years, or indefinitely without economic bankruptcy.
   However, one cannot help but ask: When did the Soviet Union ever propose an arms race to the United States? As is well known, the opposite is true. The Soviet Union has repeatedly proposed, and is still proposing, a plan for the five major powers to immediately reduce their armaments first.
   Stassen remained silent about the Soviet proposal that was rejected by the United States. He exposed himself by doing so, because he is one of the most enthusiastic advocates of the arms race. It was he, and no one else, who in the August 15 speech mentioned in his letter, demanded that all expenses in the regular budget be limited in order to increase military spending to the maximum. There is no doubt that Stassen is greatly interested in intensifying the work of military industry, just like the masterminds of Wall Street.
   Stassen also tried hard to prove in the same militaristic and exaggerated tone that the American people are determined to unanimously support the arms race, and to prove that American youth are eagerly looking forward to becoming soldiers.
   Let Stassen reflect on what he said himself, and it may be useful to raise only one question here: Why did he put these words in his letter? Everyone knows that the Soviet Union does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. However, if Stassen expects to use his words to intimidate the people of the Soviet Union, then he will be miscalculating.
   Here, Stassen is also not violating his nature as a political speculator. The purpose of his statement is to help spread the psychology of war and war hysteria in the United States.
   Stassen's trick, his ill-fated attempt to portray himself as a peacemaker, cannot deceive anyone. Besides, all his previous remarks have already marked him as a warmonger. Wasn't it he who gave a radio speech on August 15, openly calling for war against the Soviet Union, and unhesitatingly making the most shameless slanders against the Soviet Union? In his threats against the Soviet Union at the time, Stassen even urged the United States to prepare to "bring the war directly into the center of the communist countries." Because of his speech, he was ridiculed by a like-minded figure, the notorious American reactionary journalist Lippmann, who sadly admitted that the speech was a huge mistake and advised Stassen to carefully study and understand the basic knowledge of the current world military situation.
   As early as in the middle of this year, Stassen said that Truman's order to manufacture hydrogen bombs was "not enough." When giving a speech in St. Louis in March, he demanded strengthening the "offensive strategy" against the Soviet Union. When giving a speech in Carbondale in May, Stassen again demanded vigorously strengthening the "cold war."
   This is the real Stassen, the Stassen without a mask, the shameless warmonger Stassen.
   This Republican leader's letter contains a very valuable confession, which explains why warmongers want to portray themselves as peace advocates, and also exposes the true reason for Stassen's trick. In this letter, he had to admit that the American people do not approve of launching a war against the Soviet Union and will never allow this war to happen, because they continue to feel friendly to the Russian people. This explains why Stassen decided not to come forward openly and frankly, but to disguise himself as a "peacemaker." But weaknesses are exposed where the fabric is thin, and Stassen has only exposed himself.
   Despite the fact that imperialist propaganda uses all kinds of malicious conspiracies, the truth about the Soviet Union's peaceful policy, and the truth about the Soviet people's continuous struggle for peace and international cooperation are well known. The Soviet Union's peaceful policy is gaining more and more supporters in capitalist countries, including the United States. No matter how hard the warmongers try, they can never suppress the struggle of the people of all countries for peace and security.
   Because of this letter, Stassen showed that his program does not actually contain the words "peace" or "international cooperation." Stassen's program is a program to expand armaments and further strengthen war preparations. The hurriedly put on peacemaker's mask cannot cover up Stassen's true face.

　　史塔生的卑污诡计
    维克托罗夫
   【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十日电：“真理报”发表维克托罗夫所写的专文，题为“史塔生的卑污诡计”，全文如下：
   美国的国会选举日期越接近，美国资产阶级的两个主要政党——民主党与共和党——的领袖们的竞选活动就变得越紧张了。美国共和党领袖之一的史塔生，正在展开着发热昏的活动。直到现在，史塔生还不得不以宾夕法尼亚大学校长的头衔为满足。但是，他分明志在钻营更高得多的地位。应该回想一下，一九四八年史塔生是共和党总统候选竞选人之一，但是他竞选失败了，现在他在他的政党竞选运动中极端活跃，显然蓄意利用这种竞选运动来筹措政治资本。
   谦逊当然不是史塔生的品德之一。正相反，史塔生所具有的那种骄横傲慢和渴望自我宣传的程度，就连在美国政治交易所看来也是很露骨的。而在竞选运动的严重的日子里，他当然没有忘记所有一切美国手册中都指出的一点，就是说，他是曾与斯大林亲自会晤过的美国少数政治要人之一。
   十月四日，史塔生大事叫嚣，在记者招待会上声明说：他与杜勒斯及艾森豪威尔将军商量后，他已写信给斯大林，说他在那封信中表示自愿与斯大林会晤，目的在于试图“防止悄然进入战争。”
   史塔生作这样的声明时，显然估计到美国选民们的广大群众的情绪，他们由于美国统治集团所推行的政策的侵略方针、由于空前无比的扩军运动、以及由于新战争的准备，而感到非常惊慌。史塔生明白美国人民渴望和平，所以决意赶快戴起“和事人”的假面具。但是，这个假面具跟举世公认的这个战争贩子的面孔不合，这个战争贩子因为在美国外交政策的最肆无忌惮的侵略方针的支持者之列而声名狼籍了。
   史塔生的信中全部内容很清楚地表明了，这不过是一种竞选的策略手段，而且是一种笨拙的手段，一看就被人看出来了。所以难怪史塔生接连不断地失败，拆穿了他自己的卑污诡计。
   从史塔生的这封信的头几行中就可以很清楚地看得出来，他与事实没有交情，就连基本的真实性也是与他格格不合的。
   例如他一开头就武断说，他在一九四七年与斯大林谈话时他所说过的关于美国的一切，已证明了是不错的、而且是精确的。实际上，这不过是空洞的虚伪的词令罢了。
   让我们回想一下：在一九四七年，史塔生武断说，在美国是可以使“高度就业”人数稳定化的，并且武断说：在美国那个国家中，占支配地位的是调整的而不是垄断的资本主义。然而，全世界人士都知道得很清楚，美国完全失业和半失业的人数是一千八百万。这便是史塔生所说的“高度就业”的真相。至于说到“调整的而不是垄断的资本主义”，史塔生的这一种“命题”的生动证明便是这样的一件事实：据美联社的统计资料，四百五十家最大的垄断公司的总利润，今年第二季比去年第二季又增加了百分之四三。最后，史塔生本人，在今年八月十五日才发表过的最近一次演说中，他不是还发出过歇斯底里的叫嚣，说必须立刻扑灭美国的“通货膨胀热”吗？那么，他在他的这封信中所写的美国“健全的经济”又是什么样的一种经济呢？
   然而，这些不过是史塔生的信中的卑劣的歪曲。这一篇广告文字的进一步内容，把史塔生一伙厚颜无耻的政治投机者所使用的手段全部揭穿了，把用廉价的，叫嚣不休的，假装爱好和平的辞句掩饰得很拙劣的那些战争贩子们的真正目标都揭穿了。
   史塔生在他的信中不多不少地要求：苏联改变它的政策。
   人们不难看到：史塔生在提出这种狂妄的要求时不但是横蛮无理，而且是非常可笑的。这种要求使人们决不可能对于宾夕法尼亚大学校长和顽固的战争贩子杜勒斯及艾森豪威尔两人共同计划出来的“文件”采取任何一种严肃态度。
   史塔生充分理解到他的要求是荒谬绝伦的。是呀，这就是他的企图的真正目标——提出分明不可能的要求，以引起一种叫嚷，说苏联“顽固不化”，用这种方式替美国统治阶层的进一步的甚至更具侵略性的政策开辟一条道路，而史塔生便是他们的拥护者之一。
   这便是史塔生的卑污诡计的真正用意。
   史塔生拚命把他的荒诞的要求“言之成理”，毫不迟疑地尽情歪曲事情，恶意毁谤，捏造，而且徒劳无功地指黑为白，他所以要做这些事情，都是为了想把对国际局势现状应负的责任转嫁到苏联身上。
   然而事实是牢不可破的。他们对史塔生已经予以无情的驳斥了。全世界都知道：造成目前国际局势紧张的主要原因，是美国统治阶层的侵略政策，他们在朝鲜进行血腥的干涉，加紧扩军运动，赶造侵略集团，推翻联合国组织的基本原则，并拒绝以巩固和平为目的而进行的一切措施。当史塔生声言苏联的尽早和平解决朝鲜问题的坚持不变的政策是与为和平的斗争“不相容”的，而力陈美国继续干涉朝鲜人民是“到达和平”的方法，当他这样说的时候，他只是暴露自己吧了。
   不需要把史塔生所有的谎话都一一列举出来了。在赫斯特系的任何一种报纸上都可以找到这些谎话。但是史塔生在这里所说的话可以代表它们的特色，他采取这种手段，想把美国帝国主义的侵略政策特别是它的军备竞赛言之成理。史塔生在他的信中用黩武的和夸大的语气扬言美国能和苏联在重整军备上竞赛十年，或二十年，或者无限期的竞赛而不会发生经济破产。
   然而人们不禁要问：苏联曾经在什么时候向美国提议实行军备竞赛呢？如所周知，事实恰恰相反。苏联曾经再三提议过，而且现在还是提出五个大国首先立即裁减军备的计划。
   史塔生对被美国拒绝的苏联提案保持缄默。他这就暴露了自己，因为他是最热心主张军备竞赛的人之一。正是他而不是别人，在他信中所提到的八月十五日演说里，要求限制平时预算项目中一切经费以便将军费增加到最大限度。毫无疑问，史塔生对加紧军需工业的工作感到莫大的兴趣，正和华尔街的元凶巨憝们一样。
   史塔生用同样黩武而夸大的语气极力证明美国人民决心一致支持军备竞赛，并证明美国青年热望着变成士兵。
   且让史塔生把他所说的这些话自己去反省一下吧，现在不妨只提出这样一句质问：为什么他要把这些话放在他的信内呢？人人都知道，苏联不干涉其它国家的内政。然而倘若史塔生期望用他的这些话来恫吓苏联的人民，那么他就要打错算盘了。
   在这里，史塔生也是不违背他的政治投机家的本性的。他的声明的目的就在于帮助在美国散布战争心理与战争歇斯底里。
   史塔生的诡计，他想把自己描摹成一个和事人的那倒霉的企图骗不了任何人。除此之外，他以前的一切言论已经把他标明是一个战争贩子了。八月十五日发表广播演说，公开号召对苏联的战争，毫不踌躇地对苏联进行最无耻的诽谤的不就是他么？史塔生在他当时针对苏联的威吓中竟至于敦促美国准备起来，“把战争直接打进共产主义国家的中心”。因为他的这篇演说，他曾遭到具有同样思想的一个人物、臭名远扬的美国反动记者李普曼的嘲笑，李普曼悲哀地承认这篇演说是一个绝大的错误，并且忠告史塔生要细心研究并了解关于目前世界军事局势的基础知识。
   远在今年年中，史塔生曾说杜鲁门关于制造氢弹的命令是“不够的”。三月间在圣路易发表演说时，他曾要求加强对苏联的“攻势战略”。五月间在卡邦达尔发表演说时，史塔生又曾要求猛烈地加强“冷战”。
   这就是真正的史塔生，不戴面具的史塔生，无耻的战争贩子史塔生。
   这位共和党领袖的信中含有一项极有价植的自供，这个自供说明了战争贩子们为什么要把自己标榜成和平拥护者的理由，同时也暴露了史塔生这个诡计的真正理由。他在这封信中不得不承认，美国人民并不赞成发动对苏联的战争而且决不允许这个战争发生，因为他们继续对俄罗斯人民感到友好。这就说明了史塔生为什么决定不公开坦白地出面、而要把自己伪装成一个“和事人”的道理。但是布在薄处破，而史塔生只不过是暴露了自己。
   尽管帝国主义的宣传运用一切恶毒的阴谋，关于苏联和平政策的真相，关于苏联人民为和平与国际合作而作持续斗争的真相却是人所共晓的。苏联的和平政策在资本主义国家中，包括美国在内，获得越来越多的拥护者。不管战争贩子们怎样的下力，他们总无法压制各国人民为和平与安全而作的斗争。
   由于这封信，史塔生表明了他的纲领中实际并不包含“和平”的字样，并不包含“国际合作”的字样。史塔生的纲领是一个扩充军备和进一步加强战争准备的纲领。匆忙戴上的和事人的面具遮不住史塔生的那一副真面目。
