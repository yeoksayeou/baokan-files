　　How to Improve Newspaper Distribution Work?
    A Letter of Suggestion from Comrade Shao Yue of the Zhejiang Postal Administration Bureau to the Editors:

    I read Zhang Xingzheng’s suggestions regarding “Improving Our Newspaper Distribution Work” from the Qinhuangdao Post Office published in the "People's Forum" on September 25th. Now, I would like to offer some additional suggestions.

    Besides the two points mentioned by Comrade Zhang, that "various bureau distribution sections do not pay enough attention to distribution work" and "there is a careless working style," another important reason why errors frequently occur in the work of the distribution sections of various district management bureaus is that distribution work is still a new business for the post office. Generally, colleagues do not adequately recognize its importance, coupled with a lack of experience and imperfect distribution procedures and systems, resulting in low work efficiency, errors, and even a failure to correct errors in a timely manner when they are discovered. Therefore, I believe we can improve our newspaper distribution work by starting with the following three points:

    (1) Raising Employee Awareness: Currently, since distribution work is a new business, raising employee awareness of distribution work has become an important issue. Wherever employees have a good understanding of distribution work, the work is done relatively well. This is a common phenomenon in various places. The post office's education work for employees can be divided into two aspects: first, the importance of distribution work and its specific tasks and roles; second, organizing employees to study policies, so that they clearly understand the public-private relationship in distribution work – the policy of uniting and transforming private newspaper delivery businesses and delivery personnel.

    (2) Formulating a Distribution Work Handbook: At present, there is no relatively scientific distribution procedure and system to serve as a standard throughout the country. After the "postal and distribution integration" in various places, most post offices still use the original set of procedures and systems of the newspaper offices, and have done poorly in researching and improving them, which affects the actual work. Although various inland bureaus have explored and created some methods and gained some good experience, they have failed to promote and exchange this experience. This requires the General Administration to collect the opinions of colleagues working in various places (the General Administration is already doing this work) and issue a distribution work handbook, stipulating various technical procedures and systems, such as subscription methods, distribution methods, accounting methods, etc. This would avoid the current chaotic phenomenon of various post offices acting independently, and greatly reduce many technical errors. Of course, this handbook should also be continuously improved based on future actual conditions and objective requirements.

    (3) Publishing a Distribution Work Newsletter: Currently, comrades engaged in distribution work in various places urgently need specific help. Therefore, I think it is possible to publish a periodic publication related to distribution work. The task of this publication is to exchange experiences and solve the practical problems encountered in distribution work in various places. It would be best if the General Administration could publish a national publication to educate employees, guide work, and convey tasks through it.

    These opinions may not be accurate and are only for the reference of distribution work comrades in various places and the General Post Office.

### 如何改进报纸发行工作？  浙江邮管局邵越同志来信建议

　　如何改进报纸发行工作？
    浙江邮管局邵越同志来信建议编辑同志：
    九月二十五日《人民园地》刊登了秦皇岛邮局张行政同志关于“改进我们的报纸发行工作”的建议。现在我提出几点补充意见。
    各区管理局发行科工作经常发生错误的原因，除张同志所指出的“各局发行科对发行工作不够重视”和“有粗枝大叶的作风”两点以外，还有一个重要的原因，就是：发行工作对于邮局讲来，还是一种新的业务。一般工作同志对它的重要性认识不够，加上缺乏经验，发行手续与制度不健全，因而工作效率不高，发生错误，甚至发现了错误也不能及时改正。因此，我以为可以从下列三点入手，来改进我们的报纸发行工作：
    （一）提高员工的认识：目前，发行工作既是一种新的业务，提高员工对发行工作的认识就成为一个重要的问题。凡是员工对发行工作认识好的，工作都做得比较好。这是各地普遍的现象。邮局对员工的教育工作，可以分二方面：首先是关于发行工作的重要性及其具体的任务与作用等等；其次是组织员工学习政策，使他们清楚地认识发行工作中的公私关系——对私营派报所及派报人员的团结改造的政策。
    （二）制定发行工作办事手册：目前，全国尚没有一种比较科学的发行手续与制度作为准则。各地“邮发合一”后，绝大部分邮局仍沿用原有报社的一套手续与制度，在研究改善方面做得较差，以致影响了实际工作。各内地局虽则经过摸索，创造了一些办法，取得了一些好的经验，但未能把这个经验加以推广交流。这就需要总局把各地工作同志的意见收集起来（总局现已做这个工作），订出发行工作办事手册，规定各种技术性的手续与制度，如订报方法、发报方法、结账方法等等，这样就可避免目前各地邮局各自为政的混乱现象，大大地减少许多有关技术上的差错。当然，这个手册还要根据今后实际情况和客观要求，不断加以改进。
    （三）出版发行工作通讯：目前各地作发行工作的同志，迫切需要具体帮助。因此，我觉得可以出版一种定期的有关发行工作的刊物。这个刊物的任务，是交流经验与解决各地发行工作中所遇到的实际问题。总局如能出一种全国性的刊物当然最好，通过它来教育员工，指导工作，传达任务。
    这些意见不一定准确，只是供各地发行工作同志们和邮政总局参考。
                                                    邵越
