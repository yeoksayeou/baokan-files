Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 11th. The Northwest Region will implement land reform this winter and next spring in areas with a population of more than 7.6 million in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia provinces. The preparations for the implementation of land reform in the aforementioned areas have been nearly completed, and a large-scale land reform movement is about to unfold.

The areas where the Northwest People's Government has decided to implement land reform after the autumn harvest include: 41 counties in Guanzhong, Shaanxi Province, and some areas within the Great Wall in the Yulin Special District inhabited by Han Chinese; most areas of Qingyang, Zhenyuan, Ningxian, and Zhengning counties and two townships in Huanxian County in Gansu Province; some areas of Yanchi and Ningshuo counties in Ningxia Province (a total of 2,661 townships); and the suburbs of Xi'an City. The vast majority of these areas are newly liberated areas since 1949. In the past year or so, through the peasant movements of suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, and reducing rent, the peasants' awareness has been raised, and peasant associations have been universally organized in the countryside. As of now, there are approximately 800,000 members of peasant associations in the aforementioned areas.

After the second meeting of the Northwest Military and Political Committee in July passed the plan for land reform in the aforementioned areas after the autumn harvest, the People's Governments and the leading organs of the CCP in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia provinces immediately began active preparations. Shaanxi and Ningxia provinces have held provincial people's representative conferences with the implementation of land reform and rural work as the topics. The Gansu Provincial People's Representative Conference will also be held soon. County-level peasant representative conferences have also been held in various places. Local CCP organizations in various places have also held party representative conferences to discuss land reform work. In terms of cadre preparation, the region's plan to train 7,000 land reform cadres is about to be completed. Most of the training classes have already concluded. The trained cadres include local cadres at the county and district levels and young intellectuals. The training period is generally one to three months. The trained cadres have not only rectified their ideological style, but also fully studied the Land Reform Law and various policies related to land reform. The counties in Shaanxi and Gansu that are implementing land reform are now stepping up the training of township peasant association directors and other cadres, with a plan to train 1,150 people. In addition, when the land reform movement begins, 8,000 cadres working in Xi'an and provincial agencies and organizations will go to the countryside to assist in the work. Nearly a hundred people from various democratic parties have also volunteered to sign up to join the work teams to go to the countryside. Now work teams in various places have gone to the countryside one after another.

Seven townships in Chang'an, Weinan, Baoji, Xianyang, and Yulin Special Districts of Shaanxi Province are conducting land reform experiments, and the large-scale land reform movement will begin in mid-October. The Guanzhong land reform plan is divided into three phases: the first phase involves 828 townships, lasting one and a half to two months; the second phase involves 1,420 townships, lasting one to two months; and the third phase (only Chang'an County) involves 68 townships, lasting one month. The entire area can be completed by the end of February next year. Other areas can also begin at the end of October or the beginning of November. The land reform in the suburbs of Xi'an City is scheduled to begin in early December.

    【新华社西安十一日电】西北区将于今冬明春在陕西、甘肃、宁夏三省七百六十多万人口的地区实行土地改革。上述各地实施土地改革的各项准备工作均已接近完成，大规模的土地改革运动即将展开。
    西北已经人民政府决定在秋后开始实行土地改革的地区，计为：陕西省关中四十一县和榆林专区长城以内汉民族聚居住的部分地区，甘肃省庆阳、镇原、宁县、正宁四县的大部地区和环县的两个乡，宁夏省盐池、宁朔两县部分地区（以上共二千六百六十一个乡）和西安市郊区。这些地区绝大部分都是一九四九年解放的新区，一年多以来，经过剿匪、反对恶霸和减租的农民运动，农民觉悟提高，乡村已普遍组织有农民协会。截至目前，上述地区农民协会会员约八十余万人。
    今年七月，西北军政委员会第二次会议通过秋后在上述地区进行土地改革的计划后，陕、甘、宁三省的人民政府和中共领导机关立即开始了积极的准备工作。陕西、宁夏两省均已以实施土地改革和农村工作为议题，举行了省各界人民代表会议。甘肃省省各界人民代表会议亦将在最近举行。各地并先后召开过县的农民代表会议。各地中共地方组织也都召开过党代表会议，讨论土地改革工作。在干部准备方面，全区训练七千土地改革干部的计划即将完成。大部分训练班都已经结业，受训干部包括县、区各级地方干部和青年知识分子，训练时间一般为一个月到三个月。受训干部不只整顿了思想作风，并充分地学习了土地改革法和各项有关土地改革的政策。陕西、甘肃实行土地改革的各县，现正加紧训练乡农会主任等干部，共计划训练一千一百五十人。此外，土地改革运动开始时，西安和各省机关团体在职干部将有八千人下乡协助工作。各民主党派人士也有近百人自愿报名参加工作组下乡。现在各地工作组已纷纷下乡。
    陕西省长安、渭南、宝鸡、咸阳和榆林专区已有七个乡在进行土地改革的试验，大规模的土地改革运动十月中旬即将开始。关中土地改革计划分三期进行，第一期八百二十八个乡，时间为一个月半到两个月；第二期一千四百二十个乡，一个月到两个月；第三期（仅长安一县）六十八个乡，一个月。全部地区在明年二月底可完成。其他地区在十月底或十一月初也可开始，西安市郊的土地改革，则决定在十二月初才开始。
