　　Landlord Counterattacks and Murders Revolutionary Cadres
    Village Cadre Assists, Special District and County Handle the Matter Carelessly
    A Letter of Complaint from Jiang Long, Zhengding County, Hebei Province

Editor:
    I have a problem and I ask for your help in solving it. The facts are as follows:
    Fang Luoyu, a landlord in Xihcun Village, Third District, Zhengding County, is considered the only landlord in the village. His son, Fang Heigou, is a quartermaster in the Health Department of the Chahar Military Region and a member of the Chinese Communist Party. His grandson, Fang Hongchun, is the village civil affairs commissioner and the organization member of the CCP branch. Fang Luoyu claims to be a military family member who supports the Communist Party, but in his heart, he is anti-communist. During the land reform in the winter of 1947, the masses in the village were afraid of him and did not dare to struggle against him, only dividing some of his family's belongings.
    Landlord Fang Luoyu always tried every possible means to take the opportunity to counterattack the poor and landless peasants. Last year, in the seventh lunar month, his son Fang Heigou returned from the Health Department of the Chahar Military Region. He got married at home. After his vacation, Fang Heigou still did not leave, and he conspired with his father to murder the village militia captain Fang Lü and the village chief Kang Yuhuan, because they were both of poor peasant origin and active members of the land reform. On the evening of the sixth day of the seventh lunar month last year, on the pretext of asking the village cadres for a table and a long bench, he hid a pig-slaughtering knife in his waist and led his son Fang Heigou (21 years old last year), Fang Huzi (15 or 16 years old), and his grandson Fang Shuang (12 or 13 years old) to the home of the militia captain Fang Lü. Fang Lü, sensing something was wrong, hurriedly ran away. Then they turned to the home of the village chief Kang Yuhuan, shouting and cursing. Landlord Fang Luoyu said, "Return my table and long bench!" The village chief said, "We are acting according to policy, we cannot return them to you." Fang Heigou first grabbed a carrying pole from the house and desperately hit the village chief, damaging his left brain. He also knocked out the village chief's wife's teeth, injured the head of the village chief's seven-year-old daughter, Kang Aijie (who still has scars), and destroyed the village chief's bellows, basins, spinning wheel, and other belongings.
    After the village chief Kang Yuhuan was injured by the landlord Fang Luoyu and his son, under the pressure of public opinion, the county's judicial section detained the landlord Fang Luoyu and his son Fang Heigou, and ordered the landlord Fang Luoyu to be responsible for the village chief's medical expenses. However, the village chief died ten days later due to excessive blood loss and tetanus.
    After the death of Village Chief Kang Yuhuan, his son Kang Zhenjiang reported the circumstances of his father's death to the county judicial section. Xie Youfen, the head of the county judicial section (who has been dismissed for corruption and bribery), replied: "Since he is dead, then he is dead. Bury him quickly. Be careful not to waste, report expenses accurately, and you will be punished if you exceed the budget." The meaning was to let the offending landlord pay less compensation. As for how the village chief died, Xie Youfen and others from the county judicial section never sent anyone to the village to investigate.
    The landlord Fang family knew that the village chief's death was not in their favor. Fang Hongchun (who was the village civil affairs commissioner and the organization member of the branch) took the initiative to run around and plan, deciding to invite the relevant cadres in the village to "eat." Seven or eight people participated in the "meal," including Kang Piantou, the CCP village branch secretary. Fang Hongchun and Secretary Kang Piantou said: "Time is of the essence, everything depends on us. The village chief is already dead, it is important to find a way to save people - to rescue the Fang family father and son. Let's agree that the village chief was crushed to death by a cart, not from tetanus, and it has nothing to do with the Fang family, wouldn't that be settled? Who would know the truth! This must be kept absolutely secret, whoever leaks the news will suffer!" Since then, the villagers in the village and nearby villages have been saying in unison that Village Chief Kang Yuhuan was crushed to death by a cart. After Village Branch Secretary Kang Piantou and others ate at the landlord Fang family's house, under Fang Hongchun's planning, they submitted a guarantee to the county judicial section in the name of all the village cadres, saying that Village Chief Kang Yuhuan was crushed to death by a cart and had nothing to do with the landlord Fang family, requesting the government to release Fang Luoyu and his son. After receiving this guarantee, Xie Youfen, the head of the county judicial section, made a judgment: "Village Chief Kang Yuhuan was crushed to death by a cart and had nothing to do with the landlord Fang family," and so on. Soon, landlord Fang Luoyu was released, and only his son Fang Heigou was detained. When this judgment was sent to the district and village, the village chief's family felt that they had no place to seek justice, and the district cadres also expressed their indignation. The district office immediately wrote a letter to the deputy county magistrates, explaining that this judgment was wrong and requesting a new trial. They then sent the village chief's son, Kang Zhenjiang, to the county to deliver the letter. Xie Youfen, the head of the judicial section, said: "Your father was clearly crushed to death by a cart, your village cadres have proved this, what else can you say!" Later, the county judicial section made a second judgment, this time without mentioning how the village chief died, only saying that the landlord's son Fang Heigou was sentenced to four years of imprisonment, and the landlord Fang family compensated the village chief's family with 400 jin of millet to settle the matter. The village chief's family felt that this judgment was too vague and had no choice but to appeal to the Baoding People's Court. For the convenience of the trial, the Baoding People's Court transferred the case to the Shijiazhuang Special District People's Court. The Shijiazhuang Special District People's Court did not ask about the truth of the case, but only adopted a conciliation method, maintaining the original judgment of the Zhengding Judicial Section to compensate the village chief's family with 400 jin of millet, and proposed that the landlord give another two mu of land to the village chief's family as a settlement. The Shijiazhuang Special District People's Court said to the village chief's family: "Agree to it! This is how we have ruled. If you don't agree, well, you can appeal to Beijing." The village chief's family knew that they could not afford to appeal to Beijing, so they had to accept the conciliation.
    Landlord Fang Luoyu and his grandson Fang Hongchun then planned how to bail out his son Fang Heigou. This spring, a soldier from the Health Department of the Chahar Military Region came and stayed at the landlord Fang Luoyu's house for two or three days. This soldier found the village branch secretary and the district office and said: "Why are you detaining Fang Heigou? If he has committed a crime, he should be handed over to the military for processing. It's none of your business. You must find a way to get him out. We need people!" The villagers believed that this soldier had come to help the landlord get people out. Under Fang Hongchun's instigation, the party and government cadres in the village had several times jointly submitted guarantees to the county people's court, requesting the release of the landlord's son Fang Heigou.
    Now, the situation in this village is that the power of the landlord Fang Luoyu has not been suppressed, and all the cadres in the village dare not work. No one wants to be the village chief - for fear of danger. Therefore, for more than a year, there has been no village chief.
    Regarding these facts, I would like to raise a few points for you to answer:
    (1) The former Zhengding County Judicial Section Chief Xie Youfen and others did not personally come or send people to conduct investigations and research on this homicide case, but they ruled that Village Chief Kang Yuhuan was crushed to death by a cart, and then hastily revised the judgment when questioned from below. What reasons were these contradictory judgments based on?
    (2) This year, when the county trained rural branch members, the village branch secretary Kang Piantou confessed the truth about the village chief's death, explaining that the report that the village chief was crushed to death by a cart was completely a planned fabrication after the branch had been "treated to a meal," and was proposed by branch committee member Fang Hongchun under various threats. Then, we must ask: Did Kang Yuhuan, a loyal party member and hardworking village cadre, who was murdered in a planned way by the class enemy landlord for the sake of the Party and his work, die in vain? County Judicial Section Chief Xie Youfen released the landlord Fang Luoyu and only sentenced his son Fang Heigou to four years in prison. Is this judgment too lenient?
    (3) The Shijiazhuang Special District People's Court only focused on conciliation and not on correctly grasping the policy, that is, how to protect human rights, how to protect the lives of party members and revolutionary cadres, and suppress the activities of reactionaries. Is this approach correct?

### 地主反攻杀害革命干部  村干帮凶专县马虎了事  河北省正定县江龙来信控诉

　　地主反攻杀害革命干部
    村干帮凶专县马虎了事
    河北省正定县江龙来信控诉编辑同志：
    我有一个问题，请你设法帮助解决。现将事实写在下面：
    正定三区西河村地主房洛雨，在该村算是唯一的地主。他儿子房黑狗在察哈尔军区卫生部当勤务员，又是中共党员；本家孙子房红春，是该村民政委员，又是中共支部组织委员。房洛雨，自称是军属、拥护共产党，在心底里却是反共的。一九四七年冬实行土改时，该村群众都很害怕他，不敢斗他，只分了他家一些东西。
    地主房洛雨总是千方百计想法乘机向贫雇农反攻。去年阴历七月初，他儿子房黑狗从察哈尔军区卫生部回来。在家结了婚。假期已过，房黑狗仍然不走，和他爹阴谋杀害村中队长房驴、村长康玉环，因为他们都是贫农成份，土地改革中的积极分子。去年阴历七月初六黄昏时分，借口向村干部要桌子、要条几，他腰里藏着一把杀猪刀，率领他的儿子房黑狗（去年二十一岁）、房虎子（十五六岁）、孙子房双（十二三岁），先到中队长房驴家里。房驴知事不妙，急忙偷跑了。于是他转到村长康玉环家里大叫大骂。地主房洛雨说：“还我桌子和条几！”村长说：“我们按政策办事，不能还你。”房黑狗首先从屋里顺手拿了一条扁担，拚命向村长打来，打坏了他的左脑部。还打掉了村长老婆的牙齿，打伤了村长的七岁女儿康爱姐的头部（现在还有伤痕），打毁了村长家里的风箱、盆子、纺车以及其他什物。
    自从村长康玉环被地主房洛雨父子欧伤后，在群众舆论的压力下，县里司法科将地主房洛雨和他儿子房黑狗两人扣押起来，并叫地主房洛雨负责村长的医药费。但村长因流血过多，得了破伤风，在十天以后死去了。
    康玉环村长死去以后，他儿子康振江即到县司法科报告他父亲逝世的情况。县司法科长谢友芬（已因贪污受贿而撤职）答道：“死了就算已经死了，赶紧埋了吧。注意不要浪费，实报实销，超过报不了账，要受处分的。”意思是让肇事的地主少出点赔偿费；至于村长是怎样死的，县司法科谢友芬们一次也没有派人下乡调查过。
    村长的死，地主房家知道是对自己不利的。房红春（他是村民政委员，又是支部组织委员）就代为奔跑和策划，决定邀请村里的有关干部“吃饭”。参加“吃饭”的有七八个人，中共村支书康偏头，也被邀请去了。房红春和支书康偏头说：“事不宜迟，一切全在咱们身上。村长已经死了，还是想法救活人要紧——要救出房家父子两人来才对。咱们一口说定村长是被大车压死的，不是中破伤风死的，与房家无关，这不就成了吗？谁还知道个实情！这要绝对保守秘密，谁走漏了消息谁够受！”从此，该村和附近村庄的老乡都异口同声地传说着村长康玉环是被大车压死的。该村支书康偏头等吃了地主房家的饭以后，在房红春的策划下，即以全村干部的名义，向县司法科递了一个保状，说村长康王环是被大车压死的，与地主房家无关，要求政府释放房洛雨父子。县司法科长谢友芬接到这一保状后，即作了判决：“村长康玉环是被大车压死的，与地主房家无关”等情。不久，地主房洛雨就被释放，只扣留了他儿子房黑狗一人。当这一判决书送到区村里的时候，村长家里的人都觉得有冤无处伸，区干部也为此表示愤慨。区公所当即给正副县长写了封信，说明这个判决不对头，要求从新审判。遂派村长的儿子康振江送信到县里。司法科长谢友芬说：“你爹明明是被大车压死的，你村干部证明了这点，你还有什么可说！”以后县司法科又作了第二次判决，这次再也不提村长是怎么死的，只说判了地主儿子房黑狗四年徒刑，并由地主房家赔偿村长家里四百斤小米了事。村长家里认为这样判决太含混，不得已上诉到保定人民法院。保定人民法院为了便于审理起见，即转令石家庄专区人民法院受理。石家庄专区人民法院不问案件真相如何只是采取了和解办法，除维持正定司法科原判赔偿给村长家里四百斤小米外，并提出地主再拿出二亩地偿给村长家里，作为了结。石家庄专区人民法院并向村长家里说：“同意了吧！我们就是这样判决了。你们如果不同意，好，还可以到北京上诉。”村长家里知道自家无力到北京上诉，只好接受了这个和解。
    地主房洛雨和他的本家孙子房红春又计划怎样把儿子房黑狗保释出来。今年春间，由察哈尔军区卫生部来了一个军人，到地主房洛雨家住了两三天，这个军人曾找到了村支部书记和区公所说：“你们为什么要扣房黑狗？他犯了法也应该交给军队处理，你们管不着，你们一定要想办法叫他出来，我们要人呀！”村里群众认为这个军人是来帮地主要人的，村里党、政干部在房红春策动下，曾经几次联名向县人民法院递保状，要求保释地主儿子房黑狗。
    现在，这个村庄的情况是，地主房洛雨的威势还没有压下去，全村干部都不敢工作，谁也不愿意当村长——怕危险，因此，一年多了，还没有村长。
    这个事实。特提出几点来请解答：
    （一）前正定县司法科长谢友芬们对这个人命案件，没来也没有派人亲自下来作过调查研究，竟判决村长康玉环是被大车压死的，忽而因下边质问又马马虎虎修改判决，他的反复判决究竟根据什么理由呢？
    （二）今年县里训练农村支部党员，该村支部书记康偏头才将村长死去真相坦白出来，说明报告村长是被大车压死的，完全是支部“吃请”后有计划的捏造，是支组委员房红春在各方面威胁下提出来让干的。那末，我们要问：像康玉环这样一个忠实党员和积极工作的村干部，为党为工作，被阶级敌人地主有计划的杀害了，就白白死去了吗？县司法科谢友芬把地主房洛雨释放了，只给他儿子房黑狗判了四年徒刑，这个判决是否太轻呢？
    （三）石家庄专区人民法院只着重进行和解，而不着重在正确的掌握政策，即如何保障人权，如何保护党员、革命干部的生命安全，镇压反动派的活动，它这种作法对吗？
