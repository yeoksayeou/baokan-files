Significant progress has been made in drainage and damming work throughout Hebei Province. During this year's flood season, a total of 37 breaches occurred successively in the main and tributary streams of the Yongding, Daqing, Ziya, and Jiyun Rivers, inundating a total of 17 million mu of land (of which 12 million mu were due to rain and flooding). Over the past two months, under the leadership of local governments and the active efforts of the masses in rushing to dam and drain, more than ten breaches have been closed, and 12 million mu of flooded land have been drained by the end of September. Specifically, in the Ding County Special District, all breaches, large and small, except for Dongcaolu North Xukou, were completely closed by mid-August; in the Cang County Special District, 830,000 mu of the 1.18 million mu of inundated land have been drained; in the Tong County Special District, 3.6 million mu of the 4 million mu of flooded land have been drained; in Baoding, 2.5 million mu of the 4.7 million mu of flooded land have been drained; in Wuqing County, 1.2 million mu of the 1.6 million mu of inundated land have been drained; in Qingyuan County, over 240,000 mu have been drained. After the Yongding River diversion dam was completed in late August, the flooded areas of Zhuozhou and Xincheng can be sown with wheat. Other areas are still continuing with drainage and damming. However, in the drainage and damming work, many disputes have arisen between upstream and downstream areas. For example, the drainage dispute in Mayutian, Ji County, has not been resolved for over a month (Editor's note: According to a recent report from correspondents Ren Jie and Xu Cheng, it has now been resolved); the water discharge dispute between Renqiu and Wen'an has repeatedly reversed after an agreement was reached through five consultations; the drainage problem between Guan and Xiong counties has led to repeated disputes due to non-compliance with the agreement. Many other similar disputes, large and small, have also occurred in other areas, greatly affecting the completion of the drainage and damming tasks. Leaders at all levels should pay special attention to timely resolution.
    (Han Wenguang, Wang Huamin)
    Editor's note: Drainage and damming are pressing issues during the current wheat planting season. Drainage disputes are also a common and serious problem in various regions. The main reason is that cadres and the masses have departmentalism and fail to address problems from an overall perspective. Leaders at all levels must clearly grasp and be adept at applying the principles of "downstream obeys upstream, upstream appropriately considers downstream" and "small interests obey large interests, and large interests should consider small interests as much as possible," conduct thorough education and persuasion, and have plans and steps to properly handle and resolve them in a timely manner to avoid hindering wheat planting.

　　河北淹涝地脱出千二百万亩
    未了的排水纠纷应积极进行解决
    【本报讯】河北全省排水堵口工作，获得显著成绩。今年汛期中永定、大清、子牙、蓟运等河支干流先后共决口三十七处，共淹涝土地一千七百万亩（内雨涝占千二百万亩）。两月来经各地政府领导群众积极抢堵排水，截至九月底止已堵闭决口十余处，被淹涝土地已脱出一千二百万亩。计定县专区除东草芦北绪口外，其余大小决口均于八月中旬完全堵闭；沧县专区淹地一百十八万亩，已脱出八十三万亩；通县专区淹涝地四百万亩中，已脱出三百六十余万亩；保定四百七十万亩淹地中，已脱出二百五十万亩；武清县被淹涝的一百六十余万亩，已脱出一百二十余万亩；清苑全县已脱出二十四万余亩；永定河分洪坝于八月下旬完成后，涿县、新城被淹地区即可播种麦子；其他各地仍继续进行排堵中。但在排水堵口工作中，上下游发生了不少纠纷。如蓟县马玉田的排水纠纷，月余还未得到解决（编者按：据通讯员任杰、徐诚日昨来稿，近已获得解决）；任邱与文安泄水纠纷，经五次协商达成协议后，又一再反复；固安与雄县排水问题因不按协议办事，以致纠纷迭起。其他各地也发生了不少类似的大小纠纷。大大的影响了排水堵口任务的完成，各级领导应特别重视及时解决。
    （韩文光、王化民）
    编者按：排水堵口是当前种麦时节迫切的问题。排水纠纷，也是各地普遍存在着的一个严重问题，主要原因是干部与群众中都存在本位思想，处理问题未从整体观念出发，各级领导必须明确掌握并善于应用“下游服从上游，上游适当照顾下游”，以及“小利服从大利，大利尽可能照顾小利”的原则，深入进行教育说服工作，并须有计划、有步骤的来妥善处理，及时解决，以免防碍种麦。
