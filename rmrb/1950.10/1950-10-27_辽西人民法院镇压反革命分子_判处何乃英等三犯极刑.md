Liaoxi People's Court Suppresses Counter-Revolutionaries
Sentences Three Criminals Including He Naiying to Death

[Our Newspaper News] According to the directives of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council and the Supreme People's Court regarding the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities, the Liaoxi Provincial People's Court sentenced the incorrigible special agent He Naiying and the political bandit murderers Luo Zhenyuan and Kan Huaizheng to death. The executions were carried out by firing squad on the 20th of this month.

The criminal He Naiying joined the Kuomintang in September 1945 and successively served as the deputy captain of Chiang Kai-shek's "New Life Work Team" and the deputy captain of the Special Operations Team. In August 1947, he joined Chiang Kai-shek's National Defense Ministry Pacification Headquarters Northeast Second Brigade Liaobei Command Third Assault Group as a second lieutenant group member. He repeatedly engaged in counter-revolutionary sabotage activities between Tieling and Shenyang. In October of the same year, the criminal He and more than ten other bandits sneaked into Gudongtuo Village in the Third District of Tieling to carry out "anti-liquidation struggles," severely torturing and beating military dependents Liu Defu and Shang Yongsheng, village cadres Zhang Haishan and Liu Decheng, and residents Song Dianjun and Yu Dexin, and robbed them of a large number of cattle, horses, and clothing. In November, the criminal He and the bandit Gao Lianhuan went to Guoziyuan Village in the Third District of Tieling and murdered Gao Ming and Liu Congpu, activists in the land reform movement. They also captured Yao Runzhu, a village cadre from Huanggu Village in the Third District, and shot Yao after severe torture. From March 1947 to May 1948, the criminal He successively robbed peasants of more than 30,000 catties of grain and a large number of carts, horses, cattle, pigs, cloth, and clothing in the Third District of Tieling. In February 1948, the criminal He was "promoted" to "Major Group Leader of the Second Detachment Intelligence Group" and concurrently served as "Deputy Group Leader of the Action Group." He frequently sent his henchmen to Red Cliff Mouth and other areas to gather intelligence on our army. Before the liberation of Shenyang, the criminal He was reassigned as the leader of a bandit lurking group, attempting to remain hidden in the liberated area for a long time to carry out sabotage activities. He was later discovered and captured by the Tieling Public Security Bureau.

The criminal Luo Zhenyuan was a habitual bandit. In April 1947, he colluded with bandits Wang Cuiyao, Sang Guiqing, and others to organize a false self-defense force and fought against our army in Shaohuyingzi, Yixian County, wounding two of our soldiers. Later, he and Yu Jiaxiang, the head of the Third District of Yixian County, organized a "Returning Home Corps," with himself as the captain. In April 1948, the bandit Luo shot and killed the chairman of the peasant association in Nanshizhuizi Village, Shaohuyingzi, and robbed him of a large number of carts and cloth. In July of the same year, he robbed rubber-tired carts in the east of Yihuaerlou and tied up the three people on the carts and shot them in the deep mountains. The bandit also robbed three production vehicles of our army east of Beida Sibaozi Village in Beizhen County, killing one cadre and seizing more than ten large and small guns. The bandit was captured by our forces in August of this year.

The criminal Kan Huaizheng organized reactionary armed forces after August 15th and served as the deputy commander of Chiang Kai-shek's Rehe Lingyuan County Self-Defense Force. From 1946 to 1947, he successively shot and killed our soldier Guo Shaowen, our Suizhong County Detachment Leader Wei Jiagui, and the chairman of the peasant association Zou Baoman. In 1947, the bandit was promoted to the head of the pseudo-police station and colluded with the landlord Li Benzhang to lead a team to besiege our district team stationed in Muxianggou, killing the village head Yang Changqing and the militiaman Tao Yongshun, and abducting more than ten village cadres and villagers such as Tao Baoqi and Wang Yuzhu, robbing them of pistols, carts, and livestock. After the liberation of Suizhong, he was arrested by the Suizhong Public Security Bureau. (Zhao Aiguang)
