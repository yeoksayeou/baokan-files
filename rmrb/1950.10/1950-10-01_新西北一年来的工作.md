　　The Work of the New Northwest in the Past Year
    Peng Dehuai
    The People's Republic of China has been established for a year. The people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, have followed the various policies stipulated in the Common Program, implemented the people's democratic dictatorship, and used our own enthusiasm, wisdom, and hard work to begin peaceful construction. This short year can prove that the Communist Party and the people can not only thoroughly destroy the reactionary ruling institutions, but also rebuild a prosperous and strong new country. On the occasion of the great first anniversary of the National Day, it is of great significance to make a general review of our work in the new Northwest over the past year and to rectify our strength to move forward victoriously along the road of Chairman Mao.
    The five provinces of the Northwest have a vast land area, inconvenient transportation, complex ethnic groups, and a sparse population. Due to the cruel exploitation and oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, as well as the Kuomintang reactionaries' mad destruction at the time of their demise, and the resulting natural and man-made disasters, the Northwest was left desolate and dilapidated, leaving us with great difficulties in our construction work. But on the other hand, there is the experience of the construction of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, a group of revolutionary cadres who have been tempered for a long time, the heroic and arduous fighting style of the People's Liberation Army, the hardworking habits of the people of all ethnic groups, and the extremely rich resources in various parts of the Northwest. This provides us with favorable conditions for carrying out our work.
    Last September, the Northwest provinces were basically liberated. The tasks that followed were to unite the people of all ethnic groups, eliminate the remaining reactionary armed forces, eradicate special agents and bandits, stabilize social order, steadily carry out social reforms and land reform, practice strict economy, overcome difficulties, restore and develop production and construction, and strive for a fundamental turn for the better in the financial and economic situation. Based on this principle, we have mainly done the following work in the past year:
    First, the People's Liberation Army is always a fighting force.
    (1) Starting on October 12 last year, the army marched into Xinjiang, and with the assistance of the National Army (now the Fifth Army) and the uprising army (now the Twenty-second Army Corps), crossed snow-capped mountains, grasslands, Gobi deserts, and other areas, trekking thousands of miles. On October 20, the vanguard troops had advanced to Dihua. By the beginning of December, the entire Xinjiang region was reached, and the national flag of the People's Republic of China was planted on the Pamir Plateau, the remote border of the motherland. At this time, my 18th Army Corps went south to Sichuan, and the 19th Army went up the Han River, liberating Hanzhong on December 5 and sweeping away the remnants of Jiang-Hu bandits in southern Shaanxi and southern Gansu. By this time, the five provinces of the Northwest had been completely liberated, completing the glorious task of liberating the Great Northwest.
    (2) In order to stabilize social order and restore and develop production, our army adopted the policy of political persuasion and military suppression. On the basis of mobilizing the masses, great achievements have been made in suppressing bandits over the past year, with a total of more than 58,000 bandits annihilated. Among them, bandit leaders such as Wang Lingyun, the "Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan-Shaanxi-Henan-Hubei Pacification Headquarters," and Jani Mukhan, a bandit from Ha, were captured. A total of 68 various types of artillery pieces, more than 400 light and heavy machine guns, and more than 8,900 long and short guns were seized. The main bandit forces pre-arranged in the Northwest by the American-Chiang bandit gang have been basically eliminated. Our People's Public Security organs have cracked more than 100 special agent cases, destroyed more than 200 special agent organizations, and seized more than 100 special agent radio stations.
    Currently, there are still some scattered bandits fleeing in the border mountainous areas of various provinces and some areas where ethnic groups live together. They are being continuously suppressed.
    (3) According to Chairman Mao's instructions, all departments began preparing for production at the end of last year and launched a large-scale production campaign this spring. Commanders and fighters participated in production with great enthusiasm. According to incomplete statistics, the production achievements in the past year include reclaiming more than 1.6 million mu of land for cultivation. Various places are now preparing for the autumn harvest. 19 water conservancy projects are under construction. If all of them are completed, they can irrigate more than 1.7 million mu of land. The number of cattle, sheep, pigs, etc. raised reached 168,000. Other projects include the establishment of coal kilns, gold mines, paper mills, and woodworking factories. Nearly 100,000 people participated in the construction of the Tianshui-Baoji and Tianshui-Lanzhou railways. More than 3 million cubic meters of earth and stone work have been completed in the Baoji-Tianshui section alone. Half of the highway projects from Xining to Yushu, Xining to Zhangye, and southern Xinjiang to Tibet have been completed. Thanks to the painstaking research and collective creation of all commanders and fighters, the road-building troops in the Tianshui-Baoji section invented tools such as the "high-line soil transporter" and the "hemp rope circulating soil transporter," which improved efficiency by five to ten times compared to manual carrying. The road-building troops in Qinghai-Tibet, in the harsh environment of the Orla Mountains at an altitude of 4,500 meters, where the air is thin and breathing is difficult, still insisted on working with perseverance and courage. This shows that only the People's Liberation Army with a high degree of political consciousness can complete such arduous tasks.
    (4) During the winter training and rectification last winter, a recollection movement was carried out in response to the troops' thinking, so that the troops could maintain "always being a fighting force." After the political work conference this spring, all commanders and fighters in the army launched a study upsurge. As of the end of July, cadres above the regimental level had completed studying "Social Development History" and the "Common Program." The upsurge of cultural learning is even higher. Soldiers seize the gaps in bandit suppression, production, and construction, and do not let go of a minute, earnestly carrying out cultural learning, and combined with practice, they have created many learning methods. With the mutual assistance of "guaranteed teaching and guaranteed learning," commanders and fighters are working hard to eliminate illiteracy within three years. In addition, the army established 13 accelerated middle schools, which opened one after another in July. The students, about 7,000 in number, mainly absorb middle and lower-level cadres and heroic models among the soldiers to systematically study culture.
    According to the central government's instructions on rectification, a rectification movement throughout the army was launched, and document study began on July 1. Training classes will be held in July, August, and September, and rectification will be carried out by convening party representative meetings at all levels to examine and summarize work.
    (5) In order to cooperate with the liberation of Tibet, a unit of our troops stationed in Qinghai traveled for 34 days, traversing 2,000 miles of uninhabited plateau grasslands, and finally arrived victoriously in Yushu on July 24, where they were warmly welcomed by fraternal ethnic groups. They are now uniting all fraternal ethnic groups and actively building a new Yushu for the people.
    Second, strive for a fundamental turn for the better in the financial and economic situation.
    In the past year, the Northwest, like other parts of the country, has also achieved victories on the economic front.
    In implementing the central government's policy of unified management and unified leadership of financial and economic work, we have won a stable financial and price situation. The broad masses of people enthusiastically purchased public bonds (96 percent completed) and paid grain taxes (80 percent of public grain completed last year, and 107 percent of tax revenue completed in the first half of this year), ensuring national income. Governments at all levels practiced strict economy, tightened expenditures, and overcame the lack of unity and waste in the management of financial revenue and expenditure. The deficit was reduced by 19 percent compared to the budget. The state bank and state trade organs carefully managed cash and stabilized prices, thereby ending the inflation and price volatility caused by the long-term rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, laying the foundation for restoring and developing production. The broad masses of people, including legitimate industrialists and businessmen, expressed their satisfaction. This proves that the central government's policy of unified financial and economic work is completely correct.
    We have also won the beginning of a turn for the better in industry and commerce. The foundation of industry and commerce in the Northwest is very weak. After liberation last year, the takeover was completed quickly, reaching restoration. However, the extremely unreasonable production system within has not been reformed, and there is great blindness in production. With the reform of the entire social system, difficulties such as work stoppages, production cuts, and sluggish sales have occurred. In the past few months, under the principle of overall planning and consideration, we have worked hard to reform internally, adjust production and sales, and improve labor-management relations and public-private relations. The situation has improved, the phenomenon of factory shutdowns has basically stopped, and market transactions are becoming more active. This shows that legitimate industrialists and businessmen should strengthen their confidence, reform internally, develop production under the principle of both labor and management benefiting, improve management, and overcome the blindness in production under the leadership of the state-owned economy, so as to overcome difficulties and seek development.
    At present, the Northwest has begun to focus on developing industrial and mining production. In addition to restoring Yumen oil production, it is beginning to explore oil fields in various places and preparing for gradual development. The textile industry will add more than 70,000 cotton spindles and more than 4,000 wool spindles this year and next year. Electricity will increase by 4,900 kilowatts this year and continue to increase next year. The Sino-Soviet joint-stock petroleum and non-ferrous metals company in Xinjiang has now begun to organize. Due to the geographical location and abundant economic resources of the Northwest, it is determined that the Northwest will become one of the bases for national defense and industrial construction. The future of economic construction in the Northwest is infinitely bright.
    It must be pointed out that the broad working class has played a decisive role in restoring and developing production. Their spirit of hard work is commendable. The unemployment phenomenon arising from changes in the economic situation has been partially resolved through resettlement and relief, and will be fundamentally resolved as the economic situation improves.
    The traffic in the Northwest was severely damaged by the enemy. After liberation, railways and highways were quickly repaired and opened to traffic. Postal services have also been restored for more than 7,800 kilometers. The repair project of the Tianshui-Baoji section of the Longhai Railway and the construction project of the Tianshui-Lanzhou section, which are of concern to the people of the whole country and the people of the Northwest, have been started by military workers and are striving to be completed by 1952 and extended westward. This is a prerequisite for the development of the Northwest economy. Governments at all levels and all the people should assist the project to the greatest extent.
    According to the actual situation in the Northwest at present, we have determined that in a certain period, the economic construction of the Northwest will still focus on agriculture and animal husbandry. Last autumn, many areas in the Northwest suffered from disasters such as floods, hail, and bandits, and 500,000 people faced serious difficulties in their lives. The people in the vast new areas generally suffered from spring famine due to the long-term plunder by the Hu (Zongnan) Ma (Bufang, Hongkui) bandit gangs. The people's government mobilized the broad masses to fight against disasters based on the principle of self-reliance through production. After organizing sideline production, immigration and reclamation, mutual assistance, the people's government promptly allocated 240,000 dan of agricultural loans and 76,000 dan of relief grain, so that the serious disasters and spring famine could be smoothly overcome. On this basis, the spring plowing movement was launched. This year, the total summer and autumn sowing area in the Northwest reached 100 million mu, close to the pre-war level. The cotton field increased by more than 380,000 mu compared with last year. Through the people's representative conferences, peasant representative conferences, and cadre conferences at all levels, the policies of rent reduction and interest reduction, whoever plants harvests, free lending, and encouraging production and getting rich were promoted, stabilizing and improving the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants, and paying attention to helping organize the masses to solve the difficulties in production. Due to the cessation of war service, the soldiers who were captured by the Kuomintang returned to their hometowns for production, especially the hundreds of thousands of troops who devoted themselves to production and construction, which greatly increased the agricultural labor force this year. More than 2 million mu of land were reclaimed, and 3.7 million mu of water conservancy areas were increased and restored. The summer harvest is generally good. This summer, Guanzhong was extremely dry, and the autumn fields suffered great losses. Some areas in other provinces also suffered from wind, hail, and insect pests. Therefore, we must pay serious attention to disaster prevention and insect control, especially to seize the autumn harvest and autumn planting, so as to strive to increase grain and cotton production, reduce losses, and lay the foundation for the large-scale production movement next year.
    As for animal husbandry, this year we focused on maintaining the original level and gradually seeking recovery. The government loaned 48 million catties of millet, produced more than 200,000 cc of serum vaccine, and treated more than 100,000 heads of livestock, and carried out breeding and epidemic prevention. Although this is far from the objective needs, it has also begun to be implemented.
    All of these show that the financial and economic situation in the Northwest has undergone major changes. As long as cadres of governments at all levels and all the people work together and implement Chairman Mao's instructions on "Striving for a Fundamental Turn for the Better in the National Financial and Economic Situation," the barren and backward Northwest will become a prosperous and wealthy Northwest.
    Third, implement the people's democratic dictatorship.
    In order to thoroughly defeat the Kuomintang's reactionary rule and establish the people's democratic dictatorship, great achievements have been made in democratic construction in the past year. Most of the 21 counties in the old liberated area of northern Shaanxi have quickly restored the system of county and township people's congresses established on the basis of universal suffrage, developing democracy, restoring production, and healing war wounds. The six counties of Huanglong completed land reform last winter and this spring, completely eliminating the feudal system and beginning to improve the people's democratic power at the county, district, and township levels. In the vast new areas, people's governments at all levels above the county level were first established from top to bottom. After symposiums of people from all walks of life, ethnic fraternity associations, and representative meetings of workers, peasants, and other groups, and convening county and city people's representative conferences sufficient to unite all ethnic groups and all circles to carry out work together, as of today, all of the 296 counties, cities, bureaus, or autonomous regions in the Northwest provinces have convened one to four meetings, except for 17 units that have not convened people's representative conferences from all walks of life. Preliminary statistics show that more than 30,000 representatives from all walks of life participated in or assisted in the work of the people's power, and more than 400,000 representatives from county, district, and township agricultural representative conferences. This can closely connect with the masses, publicize and implement policies. In addition, governments at all levels have transformed and used more than 13,000 staff members from the old organs, especially training and promoting approximately 40,000 cadres from various regions and ethnic groups. This has strengthened the people's government's combination with the broad masses, universally carried out important work such as bandit suppression, suppression of special agents, consolidation of public security, and production disaster relief, and has carried out a series of social and democratic reforms such as opposing bullies and reducing rents step by step. On the basis of mobilizing the masses, organizing farmers' associations, destroying baojia systems, overthrowing the ruling faction of the rural landlord class, and establishing the dominant force of the peasants, the district and township political power was transformed from bottom to top through district and township peasant representative conferences, and conditions were created for land reform. Forty-eight counties and five districts in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia, with a population of approximately 7.3 million, have recently begun to carry out land reform work. People's political power at the provincial and municipal levels, Shaanxi and Ningxia provinces, and Xi'an and Xining cities have convened people's representative conferences from all walks of life, and have exercised the functions of the provincial and municipal people's congresses, and elected provincial and municipal people's governments. Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces have decided to convene provincial people's representative conferences from all walks of life in October this year and February next year to exercise the functions of the people's congress. Since its establishment in February, the Northwest Military and Political Committee has held two plenary sessions, uniting representative figures from all ethnic groups, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, and other patriotic democratic people in the Northwest. In accordance with the Common Program, the construction of people's democratic politics in the Northwest has made great achievements.
    Fourth, unite all fraternal ethnic groups and build a friendly and cooperative big family.
    The Northwest is a multi-ethnic region, with 17 ethnic groups including Han, Uyghur, Hui, Tibetan, Kazakh, Mongolian, Tu, Kirgiz, Xibe, Salar, Russian, Uzbek, Solon, Manchu, and Talanqi, Tajik, and Tatar. The population totals 26.5 million, and the various fraternal ethnic groups have nearly 7 million people, accounting for a quarter of the population of the Northwest. Due to the reactionary rule of the feudal dynasties of the past and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, discrimination, oppression, and disunity among ethnic groups have been caused. This situation has been fundamentally changed since the complete liberation of the Northwest and the establishment of the People's Republic of China. The Northwest people's governments at all levels have carried out the following work according to the ethnic policies of the Common Program: (1) Mobilizing the people of all ethnic groups to actively assist the People's Liberation Army, quickly eliminate the Hu-Ma bandit army, and suppress bandits and special agents, so that social order is basically stable, creating favorable conditions for the people of all ethnic groups to restore production. (2) The Northwest Military and Political Committee and the people's governments of various provinces have established joint ethnic democratic governments according to the principle of ethnic equality. Many minority ethnic people have assumed important positions in the government, and many outstanding elements and representatives of minority ethnic groups have been absorbed into ethnic consultation committees and people's representative conferences from all walks of life, improving the political status of the people of all ethnic groups. In ethnic minority areas, some have begun to establish ethnic regional autonomy, which has won their sincere support. (3) The third department of Lanzhou Revolutionary University, Qinghai Gongxue, and the training classes of the people's governments in various places have absorbed and trained more than 2,000 working cadres of all ethnic groups. Now, the Northwest Nationalities Institute is being prepared for establishment to continue to train minority ethnic cadres in large quantities, in order to carry out economic and cultural construction work in fraternal ethnic areas. (4) The people's governments in various places actively helped all minority ethnic groups restore and develop the economy, such as building water conservancy projects on a large scale in Ningxia and Xinjiang. In particular, state-owned trade organs conducted fair and free trade in various ethnic areas, purchasing local products such as fur, casings, medicinal materials, and highland barley, and selling various necessities such as tea, sugar, and cloth, which were warmly welcomed by the local people and stimulated their production enthusiasm. (5) For the problems between ethnic groups and the dispute events within ethnic groups, the methods of eliminating estrangement, strengthening unity, and convening unity meetings and friendship meetings of representatives of the people of all ethnic groups were adopted to fully consult and mediate, which achieved great results. (6) Cultural troupes, work teams, and medical teams were organized to conduct propaganda, condolences, and treatment in minority ethnic areas, in order to exchange culture and enhance unity. Thirteen local newspapers in Uyghur, Kazakh, and Mongolian languages were published in various places in Xinjiang, and more than ten policy documents in Uyghur and Tibetan languages were translated and printed. Irregular Uyghur and Tibetan language broadcasting programs were established in Dihua and Lanzhou, which played a considerable role in publicizing ethnic policies and improving the culture of all ethnic groups.
    Because the people's governments in various places have done the above practical work, new relations of unity, mutual assistance, friendship and cooperation have begun to be established, which has laid a good foundation of ethnic unity for us to build a new Northwest. In the future, we should earnestly implement the policy of prudence and gradual progress, continue to unite and educate the people of all ethnic groups on the basis of the existing work, develop economic construction work, vigorously train ethnic cadres, and steadily carry out various reforms when conditions are ripe.
    Fifth, reform the old culture and education, and develop new democratic culture and education.
    The cultural and educational work in the Northwest is carried out in coordination with the political and economic reforms of the entire society. In the past year, we have done the following work: (1) Unite and transform intellectuals, and strive for them to serve the people. The Northwest People's Revolutionary University and other cadre schools and various training classes absorbed more than 10,000 young intellectuals and public education personnel to participate in learning. After the initial transformation of ideology and style, more than 5,000 people have participated in various construction works. (2) After rectification, the five provinces of the Northwest now have 13 colleges and universities with more than 8,500 students, 309 middle schools with 79,463 students, and 24,872 elementary schools with 1,276,655 students. Most of these schools have been rectified and reformed, reactionary courses have been abolished, new teaching materials and methods have been adopted, democratic management has been implemented, and they have participated in various social activities, and have begun to implement the new democratic education policy. (3) Carry out worker-peasant supplementary education. Xi'an and Lanzhou each established a worker-peasant accelerated middle school, and many central cities have established vocational and amateur supplementary schools or cultural classes. Last winter, 74 counties in various provinces established 8,769 winter schools with 326,000 students. This has played a certain role in promoting the culture of workers and peasants. (4) Through four radio stations, 40 newspapers, 90 Xinhua bookstores, and various cultural troupes, cinemas, folk education centers, and various seminars, study meetings, and people's representative conferences from all walks of life, the political awareness of cadres at all levels, students of all schools, and the broad masses has been greatly enlightened and educated. At the same time, in production disaster relief, bandit suppression and special agent suppression, stabilizing financial prices, various economic construction, and democratic reforms, they personally experienced the correctness of the various policies of the people's government, thereby eliminating some incorrect views in the past and greatly enhancing the confidence in building a new China. (5) Health work: The Ministry of Health issued a total of 120,000 dozen smallpox vaccines in February (excluding the army), which have been vaccinated for more than 1 million people. Typhoid and cholera vaccines were issued in the summer, which can be used for 1 million people. In March and April, three work teams were organized to go to disaster areas such as Dali, Weinan, and Sanyuan to carry out medical and epidemic prevention work. Gansu also organized mobile medical teams to go to Linxia, Xiahe, and other places to carry out work, preventing the spread of epidemics in disaster areas. Xi'an and Lanzhou have held health exhibitions to expand the publicity and education of health care and epidemic prevention. The current sanitary and medical equipment in various provinces is very poor. Medical and health and veterinary work in ethnic minority areas should be given special attention in the future.
    In general, after a year of hard work, we have eliminated the Hu-Ma bandit gang, completed the glorious task of liberating the Great Northwest, basically suppressed bandits, established revolutionary order, initially restored production and construction, stabilized financial and economic prices, and began to establish new relations of friendship and cooperation between various ethnic groups. Culture and education have also undergone preliminary rectification and reform. These achievements have been obtained by the unity of the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest and the efforts of cadres at all levels of the Party, government, and army, especially the correct leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao. We are not satisfied with these achievements, and we are very clearly aware that there are still shortcomings in our work. The main ones are that some cadres do not have a firm grasp of policies and have not been able to combine policies well with specific circumstances. Some cadres have bureaucratic and commandist styles, which have caused undue obstacles and losses to the work. These shortcomings have begun to be corrected after several months of rectification and study, and must be overcome.
    The Northwest has vast land that can be migrated and reclaimed, vast grasslands that can develop animal husbandry, and rich mineral deposits that can build industry, and it is adjacent to the friendly Soviet Union, which can obtain necessary assistance. It has a full prospect for development. As long as we are not arrogant or impetuous, advance steadily, unite as one, and overcome difficulties, the face of the Northwest will definitely change after four or five years of hard work. Finally, we shouted:
    Long live the Chinese people's liberation!
    Long live the new China!
    Long live Chairman Mao!

　　新西北一年来的工作
    彭德怀
    中华人民共和国成立已经一周年了，西北各族人民和全国人民一道，在中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，遵照共同纲领所规定的各项政策，实行人民民主专政，用我们自己的热情、智慧和艰苦努力，开始和平建设，短短的一年，即可以证明：共产党与人民不仅能够彻底破坏反动统治机构，而且能够重新建设起来一个繁荣富强的新国家。值此伟大的国庆一周年之际，把我们新西北一年来的工作作一总的检阅，并整顿我们的力量。沿着毛主席的道路胜利前进，是有非常重大意义的。
    西北五省地面辽阔，交通不便，民族复杂，人口稀少，由于帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的残酷剥削和压迫，及国民党反动派灭亡时的疯狂破坏，以及由此造成的天灾人祸，把西北弄得荒凉残破不堪，给我们建设工作中遗留了很大的困难。但另一方面，有陕甘宁边区建设的经验，有一批经久锻炼的革命干部，有人民解放军英勇艰苦奋斗的作风，各族人民有勤劳刻苦的习惯，西北各地有极其丰富的资源，这又给我们开展工作提供了有利条件。
    去年九月西北各省已算基本上解放了，随之而来的任务，就是团结各族人民，消灭残余反动武装，肃清特务土匪，安定社会秩序，稳步进行社会改革和土地改革，厉行节约，克服困难，恢复和发展生产建设，为争取财政经济基本好转而斗争。本此方针，一年来我们主要做了以下各项工作：
    第一、人民解放军永远是一支战斗队
    （一）去年十月十二日开始进军新疆，在民族军（现在的第五军）和起义军（现在的二十二兵团）协助下，越过雪山草地，戈壁、沙漠等地带，跋涉数千里。于十月二十日先头部队已进至迪化。十二月初即达全疆，将中华人民共和国的国旗插到祖国遥远的边疆帕米尔高原。此时我十八兵团南下入川，十九军溯汉江而上，十二月五日解放汉中，扫清陕南、陇南蒋胡残匪。至此西北五省获得全部解放，完成了解放大西北的光荣任务。
    （二）为了安定社会秩序，恢复和发展生产，我军采取了政治争取和军事清剿的方针，在发动群众的基础上，一年来剿匪是有很大成绩的，计歼匪五万八千余人。其中俘匪首“川陕豫鄂绥靖总指挥”王凌云及哈匪贾尼木汉等，共缴获各种炮六十八门，轻重机枪四百余挺，长短枪八千九百余支，美蒋匪帮预布在西北的主要股匪已基本肃清。我人民公安机关破获特务案百余件，摧毁特务组织二百多个，缴特务电台百余部。
    目前尚有若干残散土匪流窜各省边境山区及部分民族杂居地区，正在继续肃清中。
    （三）根据毛主席的指示，各部去年年底即开始准备生产，今春即开展了大生产运动，指战员们以高度的热情参加生产。一年来的生产成绩，据不完全统计，开荒种地一百六十余万亩，现各地正在准备秋收。兴修水利十九处，如全部完成，可灌地一百七十余万亩，牧牛、羊、猪等十六万八千只，其他还开办煤窑、金矿、造纸厂、木工厂等。并近十万人参加修筑天宝、天兰铁路，仅宝天段已完成三百余万土石方工程，西宁至玉树、西宁至张掖，南疆至西藏的公路工程已完成一半。由于全体指战员的苦心钻研与集体创造，天宝段修路部队发明了“高线运土机”“麻绳循环运土机”等工具，较人担运提高效率五倍至十倍。青藏修路部队，在拔海四千五百公尺的鄂拉山区，空气稀薄、呼吸困难的环境下，仍以坚毅勇敢的精神坚持工作。这说明了只有高度政治觉悟的人民解放军，才能完成这样艰巨的任务。
    （四）去冬整训中，针对部队思想，进行了回忆运动，使部队保持“永远是一支战斗队”。今春政治工作会议后全军指战员即掀起了一个学习热潮，截至七月底团以上的干部已学完《社会发展史》及《共同纲领》。文化学习热潮更是高涨，战士们抓紧剿匪、生产建设的空隙，不放过一分钟，认真地进行文化学习，并结合实际创造了很多学习方法，指战员们在“包教保学”的互助下，为三年内消灭文盲而努力。此外全军共成立了十三个速成中学，均于七月内相继开学，学员约七千人，主要吸收中下级干部与战士中的英雄模范，有系统的学习文化。
    根据中央整风指示，展开了全军整风运动，七月一日已开始学习文件。在七、八、九三个月中分别举办训练班，同时以开各级党代表会检查总结工作等方式进行整风。
    （五）为配合解放西藏，我青海驻军一部经过了三十四天的长途跋涉，穿越两千里旷无人烟的高原草地，终于七月二十四日胜利的抵达玉树，受到兄弟民族的热烈欢迎，现正在团结各兄弟民族，积极的建设人民的新玉树。
    第二、为争取财政经济状况基本好转而斗争
    一年来西北和全国各地一样，在经济战线上也取得了胜利。
    在贯彻执行中央人民政府统一管理和统一领导财政经济工作的方针下，我们已争得了金融物价平稳的局面，广大人民踊跃认购公债（完成百分之九十六），缴纳粮税（去年公粮完成百分之八十，本年上半年税收完成百分之一百零七），保证了国家收入。各级人民政府厉行节约，紧缩开支，克服了财政收支管理上的不统一和浪费现象，赤字较预算缩减了百分之十九，国家银行和国家贸易机关，认真管理现金，稳定物价，从而就结束了国民党反动派长期统治所造成的通货膨胀与物价波动的局面，给恢复与发展生产奠定了基础。广大人民包括正当工商业者在内，都表示满意。证明中央统一财经工作的方针是完全正确的。
    我们也争得了工商业的开始好转。西北工商业的底子是很薄弱的，去年解放后，迅速完成接管，达到恢复。但内部极不合理的生产制度尚未改革，生产上存在着很大的盲目性，随着整个社会制度的改革曾发生了停工、减产、滞销的困难情况。几个月来，我们在统筹兼顾原则下，努力改革内部，调整产销，改善劳资关系和公私关系，情况已趋好转，停厂歇业现象基本上停止，市面交易益见活跃。这说明正当工商业者应坚定信心，改革内部，在劳资两利方针下，发展生产，改进经营，在国营经济的领导下，克服生产中的盲目性，就可度过困难并求得发展的。
    目前西北已开始有重点地发展工矿业生产，除恢复了玉门油产外，正开始勘察各处油田，准备逐步发展，纺织业在今明年内增装七万多棉纱锭和四千多毛纺锭，电力今年增装四千九百千瓦，明年继续增装，中苏两国在新疆合办的石油和有色金属公司，现已开始组织。由于西北的地理位置和丰富的经济资源条件，就决定西北将成为全国国防和工业建设的基地之一，西北经济建设的前途是无限光明的。
    必须指出：广大工人阶级在恢复与发展生产中起了决定的作用，他们艰苦努力的精神是值得赞扬的，在经济情况变动中所产生的失业现象，经分别安置救济，部分得到解决，并将随经济情况好转求得根本解决。
    西北的交通曾遭敌人重大破坏，解放后铁路公路均已迅速修复通车，邮政亦已恢复了七千八百余公里，全国人民和西北人民所关心的陇海路天宝段整修工程和天兰段建筑工程，已由军工开始进行，争取一九五二年内完成，并向西延伸。这是发展西北经济的先决条件，各级人民政府和全体人民应以最大努力协助工程的进行。
    根据目前西北的实际情况，我们确定在一定时期内，西北经济建设仍以农牧业为主的方针。去秋西北许多地区遭受水、雹、匪等灾害，五十万人民生活发生严重困难，广大新区人民因久受胡（宗南）马（步芳、鸿逵）匪帮掠夺，因而亦普遍发生春荒；人民政府曾动员广大群众本生产自救方针，向灾荒作斗争，经过组织副业生产，移民垦殖，互济互助，人民政府及时拨发农贷粮二十四万石，又拨救济粮七万六千余石，遂使严重的灾荒和春荒得以平稳度过，在此基础上开展了春耕运动，今年全西北夏秋播种面积达一亿亩，接近了战前水平，棉田比去年增加三十八万余亩。经过各级各界人民代表会、农民代表会和干部会议，推行了减租减息，谁种谁收，自由借贷，鼓励生产发家的政策，稳定和提高了广大农民的生产情绪，并注意帮助组织群众解决生产中的困难。由于停止战勤，原被国民党抓去的士兵还乡生产，特别是数十万大军投入生产建设，就使今年农业劳动力大为增加，开荒达二百余万亩，增修及恢复水利面积三百七十万亩。夏收一般是好的，今年夏季关中亢旱，秋田受损很大，其他各省部分地区亦遭风雹虫灾，因此我们就必须认真注意防灾防虫，特别注意抓紧秋收秋种，以争取增产粮棉，减少损失，为明年大生产运动打下基础。
    至于畜牧业，今年着重保持原有水平，逐步求得恢复，政府贷款折小米四千八百万斤，制造血清疫苗二十余万公撮，治疗牲畜十余万头，并进行了配种防疫等工作，这虽然距离客观需要甚远，但也开始着手了。
    所有这些，都说明西北财政经济状况已有了重大变化，只要各级人民政府干部和全体人民一致努力，贯彻执行毛主席《为争取国家财政经济状况基本好转而斗争》的指示，贫瘠落后的西北就会变成繁荣富足的西北。
    第三、实行人民民主专政
    为着彻底打垮国民党的反动统治，建立人民民主专政，一年来在民主建设上获有巨大成果。陕北老区二十一县的大部已迅速恢复了在普选基础上建立的县、乡人民代表大会的制度，发扬民主，恢复生产，医治战争创伤。黄龙六县于去冬今春完成了土地改革，彻底消灭封建制度，开始健全了县、区、乡人民民主政权。在广大新区，首先自上而下建立了县以上各级人民政府，经过各界人士座谈会、民族联谊会、工农群众等代表会，和召开足以团结各族各界共同进行工作的县、市人民代表会议，截止今日，西北各省的二九六县、市、局或自治区除十七个单位未召开各界人民代表会议外，其余均召开了一至四次。初步统计参加或协助政权工作的各界人民代表会议的代表有三万余人，县、区、乡农代会的代表达四十万人以上，这就能够密切群众联系，宣传贯彻政策，加之各级政府曾经改造使用了一万三千余名旧机关的职员，特别是培养提拔了各地区及各民族的干部约四万余人，这样加强了人民政府结合广大群众，普遍进行了剿匪、肃特、巩固治安和生产救灾等重要工作，并有分别地有步骤地进行了反对恶霸、减租等一系列的社会改革和民主改革，在发动群众、组织农会，摧毁保甲，打倒农村地主阶级的当权派，树立农民优势力量的基础上，又经过区、乡农民代表会议，自下而上地改造了区、乡政权，并为土地改革创造了条件，陕甘宁三省有四十八个县又五个区约七百三十万人口最近就开始进行土地改革工作。各省、市级人民政权，陕西、宁夏两省及西安、西宁市已召开了各界人民代表会议，并已代行了省、市人民代表大会的职权，选举产生了省、市人民政府。甘、青、新三省已决定于今年十月和明年二月召开省各界人民代表会议，执行人民代表大会的职权，西北军政委员会自二月成立以来已举行了两次全体委员会，团结了足以代表西北各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派及其他爱国民主人士的代表人物，依据共同纲领，西北人民民主政治建设具有很大的成就。
    第四、团结各兄弟民族、建立友爱合作的大家庭
    西北是一个多民族地区，有汉、维、回、藏、哈、蒙、土、柯、锡、撒、俄、乌、索、满及塔兰旗、塔吉克、塔塔尔等十七种民族，人口共两千六百五十万，各兄弟民族近七百万人，占西北人口四分之一。由于历代封建王朝及蒋介石匪帮的反动统治，造成了民族间的歧视、压迫和不团结的现象，这种情况自西北全部解放和中华人民共和国成立以来，已经基本改变了，西北各级人民政府根据共同纲领的民族政策，进行了如下的工作：（一）动员各族人民群众积极援助人民解放军，迅速消灭胡马匪军，肃清土匪特务，使社会秩序基本安定，给各族人民恢复生产创造了有利的条件。（二）西北军政委员会和各省人民政府按民族平等原则成立了民族民主的联合政府，很多少数民族人士担任了政府中的重要职务，很多少数民族的优秀分子和代表人物，被吸收到各民族协商委员会和各界代表会议中，提高了各民族人民的政治地位。在民族聚居地区，有的已开始建立了民族区域自治，获得他们的热诚拥护。（三）兰州革命大学第三部、青海公学及各地人民政府的训练班，已吸收和培养了两千多名各族人民的工作干部，现在西北民族学院正筹备成立，继续大量培养少数民族干部，借以开展兄弟民族地区的经济文化建设工作。（四）各地人民政府积极帮助各少数民族恢复和发展经济，如在宁夏、新疆大量兴修水利，特别是国营贸易机关在各民族地区进行公平自由的贸易，收购土产如皮毛、肠衣、药材、青稞，并推销各种必需品如茶、糖、布等，受到当地人民的热烈欢迎，并刺激了他们的生产情绪。（五）对各民族间的问题与各民族内部的纠纷事件，采取消除隔阂，加强团结，召开各族人民代表的团结会、联谊会等办法，充分协商，进行调处，获得很大成绩。（六）组织了文工团、工作组、医疗队到少数民族区域进行宣传、慰问、治疗等工作，借以交流文化，增强团结。在新疆各地出版了维、哈、蒙三种文字的十三种地方报纸，又译印了维、藏文的政策文件十余种，在迪化和兰州建立不定期的维、藏文语的广播节目，这些对于宣传民族政策、提高各族文化起了相当大的作用。
    由于各地人民政府做了上述实际工作，就开始建立了各民族团结互助友爱合作的新关系，给我们建设新西北打下了民族团结的良好基础。今后应认真执行慎重缓进的方针，在已有的工作基础上继续团结教育各民族人民，发展经济建设工作，并用大力培养民族干部，待条件具备时稳步进行各项改革。
    第五、改革旧的文化教育，发展新民主主义的文化教育
    西北的文化教育工作是配合着整个社会的政治经济的改革同时进行的。一年来，我们做了如下的几项工作：（一）团结改造知识分子，争取他们为人民服务。西北人民革命大学等干部学校及各种训练班吸收了万余青年知识分子和公教人员参加学习，经过思想作风的初步改造，已有五千多人参加各种建设工作。（二）西北五省经过整顿后，现有专科以上学校十三所，学生约八千五百人，中等学校三百零九所，学生七万九千四百六十三人，小学二万四千八百七十二所，学生一百二十七万六千六百五十五人。这些学校大部分经过整顿和改革，取缔了反动课程，采用了新的教材和教法，实行了民主管理，参加了各种社会活动，开始执行了新民主主义教育方针。（三）开展工农补习教育，西安、兰州各办了一所工农速成中学，许多中心城市都办了职工业余补习学校或文化班。去冬各省七十四县办了八千七百六十九处冬学，有学生三十二万六千人。对于提高工农文化起了一定的推动作用，（四）通过了四个广播电台，四十种报纸，九十家新华书店和各个文工团、电影院、民教馆以及各种座谈会、学习会、各界人民代表会等各式各样活动，给各级干部、各校学生、广大群众政治认识上以很大的启示和教育，同时他们在生产救灾、剿匪肃特、稳定金融物价各项经济建设及民主改革中，亲身体验到人民政府各种政策的正确性，从而扫除了过去某些不正确的看法，大大提高了建设新中国的信心。（五）卫生工作：卫生部二月间共发牛痘苗十二万打（不包括军队的），已接种一百余万人，夏季发出伤寒霍乱疫苗，可供一百万人之用，三、四月间曾组织三个工作组分赴大荔、渭南、三原等灾区进行医疗防疫工作。甘肃亦曾组织巡回医疗队到临夏、夏河等地进行工作，制止了灾区的疫病蔓延。西安、兰州都举办过卫生展览会，扩大了卫生保健和防疫的宣传教育。各省现有卫生医药设备很差，少数民族地区的医药卫生及兽医工作，今后应特别加以重视。
    总的来看，经过一年的努力，我们消灭了胡马匪帮，完成了解放大西北的光荣任务，基本上肃清了土匪，建立了革命秩序，初步恢复了生产建设，稳定了金融物价，各民族间开始建立了友爱合作的新关系，文化教育也有初步整顿和改革。这些成绩是西北各族人民团结一致和党政军各级干部的努力，特别是中央人民政府和毛主席的正确领导所获得的。我们并不满足于这些成绩，很清楚地知道，我们工作中还有缺点，主要的是某些干部掌握政策不稳，未能很好地把政策与具体情况相结合，部分干部有官僚主义和命令主义作风，使工作遭受了不应有的阻碍和损失。这些缺点经过几个月的整风学习，已经开始改正，而且必须予以克服。
    西北有辽阔的土地可以移民开垦，有广大的草原可以发展牧畜，有丰富的矿藏可以建设工业，且与友邦苏联接壤，可以取得必要的帮助，是有充分发展的前途的，只要我们不骄不躁，稳步前进，团结一致，克服困难，经过四、五年的努力，西北的面貌必将改变。最后我们高呼：
    中国人民解放万岁！
    新中国万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    一九五○年九月二十六日
