    On the glorious anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we extend our heartfelt greetings to our Chinese friends and offer our warmest congratulations to you, the working people of China, for your liberation from long-term enslavement and for your initial achievements in the construction of the new China.

    When we, the members of our collective farm, read the report by Liu Shaoqi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, on land reform in China in the July 31st issue of "Pravda," we were reminded of the days, long ago, when the Soviet government promulgated the decrees on land and water reform in our sunny Turkmenia. Before the October Revolution, all land and water in Turkmenia belonged to landlords, feudal lords, and clergy. Turkmen farmers had no land or water, and they were forced to lease land from landlords under conditions of unfreedom, handing over three-quarters of their harvest to the landlords. The landlords seized everything. Farmers could not pay their rent and became debtors to the landlords, working the land, grazing sheep and camels for them. The land where our collective farm is now located used to belong to the landlord Berd Ishan Gokchaba. We, over a hundred farmers – hired laborers, worked for him almost without compensation. The farmers were illiterate, uneducated, and lived a half-starved existence. But because the Soviet government issued decrees on land and water reform, all the land owned by the landlords in Turkmenia was confiscated and handed over to the farmers. In our Bairam-Ali district, the land of the landlord Gokchaba was confiscated and given to the farmers and hired laborers. We are deeply grateful to the Soviet government for its care for the farmers. We all received land at that time, but we had no farm tools or livestock. The harvests of grain and cotton were very poor. The government helped us. We received seeds of grain and cotton, and agricultural implements such as plows, harrows, and cotton planters from the state. We cultivated the land with tractors. The harvest increased. In 1929, we organized a collective farm. I was elected chairman of the council. In the first year, we opened up forty hectares of land to grow cotton. At this time, we harvested 1,100 kilograms of cotton per hectare. We applied advanced agricultural techniques and increased the harvest rate year after year, and we increased the sown area of cotton. In 1946, we obtained a yield of 3,780 kilograms per hectare on 120 hectares of cotton, and in some individual fields, the harvest was almost more than double. I was therefore awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor. But this is not the greatest limit. We must achieve higher harvests based on the adoption of advanced agricultural techniques. In 1949, the income of the collective farm was 2.61 million rubles. Each workday was worth 17 rubles 30 kopecks and 1,750 centimeters of grain. Before the reform, Alamravdo Kurban was a hired laborer of a landlord. Now he is a collective farm member. In 1949, his family of three earned 20,500 rubles and 4,810 kilograms of grain. Ye Xin Alazli's family of five earned 47,000 rubles and 9,711 kilograms of grain. In addition, they obtained wool, vegetables, and fruits. These are not just isolated examples. All our collective farm members work selflessly and receive high incomes according to their workdays. Each member has their own cattle, sheep, and poultry for their own enjoyment. Our collective farm members live very prosperously. In 1936, we built a socialist village. In this village, there are schools, nurseries, clubs, maternity hospitals, and libraries. A recreation palace for the members will also be completed. We have cultivated an orchard of eight hectares. Public animal husbandry is prospering. There are 8,000 sheep in the sheep farm; 250 cattle in the cattle farm; 162 horses in the horse farm, of which 20 are Akhal-Teke and 40 are Orlov trotters; in addition, there is a poultry farm. After the formation of the collective farm, the cotton fields of the collective farm increased to 480 hectares. This is our main crop. This year, collective farm members organized a Stakhanovite movement to defend world peace. They guaranteed a harvest of no less than 2,500 kilograms per hectare. Individual work teams, such as the work team of the Hero of Socialist Labor Shabartang Jiangli Atte, and the work team of Atte Orazklych, are fighting to achieve a harvest of 4,000 kilograms of cotton per hectare. The work teams of Anna Stablekova and Shamonpan Yoldokosov guarantee to harvest 6,000 kilograms of Tonkovolok cotton per hectare in their area. Our collective farm ranks first in the district in terms of cotton harvest. We will complete our annual plan on November 1st as a gift to commemorate the 33rd anniversary of the October Revolution. Our members salute the Chinese people who are now carrying out land reform, and wish you an excess of grain and industrial crops - cotton, and wish the Chinese farmers happiness and culture to improve day by day.

　　给我们的中国农民朋友们

    本文作者是苏联社会主义劳动英雄，苏联最高苏维埃代表，“布尔什维克”集体农庄主席。  
   ——编者
    在中华人民共和国开国一周年的光荣纪念日，我们以欢欣的心情，向我们的中国朋友们致敬，并为你们，中国的劳动人民，从长久的奴役下获得了解放，并在新中国建设中取得了最初的成就，致热烈的祝贺。
    我们集体农庄的庄员们，在七月三十一日的《真理》报上读到了中共中央书记刘少奇关于中国土地改革的报告，我们当时就想起了很久以前苏维埃政府曾经公布我们阳光和煦的土库曼的土地水利改革法令的日子。在十月革命以前，土库曼的土地和水流全是属于地主、领主与僧侣们所有的。土库曼的农民们没有土地，也没有水流，他们被迫在没有自由的条件下向地主们承租土地，并把四分之三的收获缴纳给地主。地主们把一切都攫夺光了。农民缴不起地租，而变成了地主们的债务人，给地主们种地，放牧羊群与骆驼。现在我们集体农庄所在的这块地方，在以前地和水全是属于地主别尔德·伊山·高克察巴的。我们一百多个农民——雇农，当时几乎都是毫无报偿地为他工作。农民们都不认识字，没有知识，度着半饥饿状态的生活。但是由于苏维埃政府发布了关于土地水利改革法令，全土库曼地主所有的土地尽被没收并交给了农民们。在我们巴伊拉蒙·阿利区，没收了地主高克察巴的土地，并把土地交给了农民和雇农。我们衷心地感激苏维埃政府对农民的关怀。我们所有的人在当时都分得了土地，但是我们在当时没有农具，也没有畜力。谷物和棉花的收成都很差。政府帮助了我们。我们从国家得到了谷种、棉种、农作器具如犁、耙、棉花播种机等。我们用拖拉机耕种土地。收成提高了。一九二九年我们组织了集体农庄。我被选为理事会主席。在头一年里，我们开拓了四十公顷面积的土地种植棉花。此时每公顷地里我们收获了一千一百公斤棉花。我们应用先进的农业技术，年复一年地提高收获率，我们并增加了棉田的播种面积。一九四六年，我们在一百二十公顷棉田中每公顷获得了三千七百八十公斤的产量，而在一些个别田地上，收获量差不多多出一倍以上，我因此而获得了社会主义劳动英雄的称号。但这并不就是最大的极限，我们还要在采用先进的农业技术的基础上，达成更高的收成。一九四九年集体农庄的收入为二百六十一万卢布。每一个劳动日价值为十七卢布三十戈比及一千七百五十公分谷物。在改革以前，阿拉姆拉夫多·库尔班是一个地主的雇农。现在他是一个集体农庄庄员。在一九四九年，他一家三人的收入为二万零五百卢布和四千八百一十公斤谷物。叶辛·阿拉兹利一家五人收入四万七千卢布和九千七百一十一公斤谷物。除此以外，还获得有羊毛、菜蔬及果物等。这并不只是个别的例证。我们所有的集体农庄庄员们都忘我地劳动着，并按劳动日而得到很高的收入。每个庄员都有他自己享用的牛羊和家禽。我们的集体农庄庄员们生活得十分富裕。一九三六年，我们建设了一个社会主义的村庄、在这村庄里，有学校、托儿所、俱乐部、接生院和图书馆，一所庄员的休息宫亦将竣工。我们栽培了一个八公顷地的果园。公共畜牧业在繁荣着。在饲羊场里有八千头羊；饲牛场里有二百五十头牛；饲马场里有一百六十二匹马，其中有二十匹是阿哈尔吉卡种，四十匹是阿尔罗夫种；此外还有家禽饲养场。集体农庄组成后，集体农庄的棉田扩增到了四百八十公顷。这是我们的主要作物。今年集体农庄庄员们为保卫世界和平而组织了斯达哈诺夫运动，他们保证了每公顷的收获量不少于二千五百公斤。个别的工作队，如社会主义劳动英雄沙巴尔坦格·江利·阿特工作队，阿特·奥拉兹克利奇工作队，都正为争取每公顷收获四千公斤棉花而斗争着。安娜·斯塔别柯娃与沙蒙潘·约尔多可索夫的工作组保证要在自己的区域内收获每公顷六千公斤的顿科伏罗克种棉花。我们集体农庄在棉花收成方面，占本区的第一位。我们将在十一月一日完成我们的一年计划，作为纪念十月革命三十三周年纪念的献礼。我们的庄员们向现在正在实行土地改革的中国人民致敬，并敬祝你们的谷物与工艺作物——棉花超额丰收，敬祝中国农民的幸福与文化与日俱进。
