Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 23rd: Diao Kaizhi, Wang Shouwu, Ge Xihuai and other 88 returned students from the United States, who arrived in Guangzhou on October 14, recently jointly published an article entitled "Our Understanding of the United States." The article stated: America is now enveloped in an atmosphere of war. The American government is using a two-pronged approach of intensifying war preparations and reactionary propaganda to push their country down the path of war. However, the vast majority of the American people are kind and peace-loving. When we left the United States, many American friends said to us: "Please tell the Chinese people that no matter what the American government's attitude towards China is, we are still China's most sincere friends." The big American capitalists are resolutely advocating aggressive war. They made a "war fortune" in the two World Wars. Under the threat of economic crisis, they want to launch a third World War. They arrogantly believe that the United States should conquer the whole world, the Pacific Ocean should be an American lake, and the American defense line should be set in the Taiwan Strait and on the Yalu River, and so on. Progressive elements who oppose aggressive war continue to struggle under the unreasonable oppression of the American government. For example, many professors at the University of California would rather give up their professions than take an anti-communist oath. When Communist leader Dennis was imprisoned, he said, "You can imprison me personally, but you cannot imprison the thoughts I believe in." Despite the US government's repression, more than a million people had signed the World Peace Council's Peace Declaration by the end of August.

The article also stated: The American government once tried to win over Chinese students in the United States through "relief," but when the "co-optation" plan failed to achieve results, it exposed its ferocious face and illegally destroyed progressive student organizations. The forced cessation of activities of the Science Workers Association in the United States is a prominent example. At the same time, the American government used various despicable means to monitor the words and actions of our students in the United States, and obstructed the return of students to their country in various ways. Under the pretext of "preventing the leakage of secrets," the return of students in the United States became a problem. The arrest of Professor Qian Xuesen and others is an example.

　　归国留美学生联名著文
    揭露美帝备战与反动宣传
    【新华社广州二十三日电】十月十四日抵达广州的归国留美学生刁开智、王守武、葛修怀等八十八人顷联名发表《我们对美国的认识》一文。该文略称：现在美国正被战争空气所笼罩，美国政府正用加紧备战与反动宣传双管齐下的手段把他们的国家推向战争的绝路。但是，美国绝大多数的人民却是善良与爱好和平的。我们离开美国的时候，许多美国朋友都对我们说：“请你们告诉中国人民，无论美国政府对中国的态度如何，我们依旧是中国最诚恳的友人。”美国大资本家是坚决主张侵略战争的，两次世界大战使他们发了“战争财”。在经济危机的威胁下，他们又想发动第三次世界大战。他们狂妄地认为美国应该征服全世界，太平洋应该是美国的内湖，美国的防线应该设在台湾海峡和鸭绿江畔等等。反对侵略战争的进步分子，在美国政府的无理压迫下，继续奋斗着。如加州大学许多教授为了拒绝反共发誓而宁愿放弃职业。共产党领袖但尼斯被关进狱时说：“你们能监禁我个人，但不能监禁我信仰的思想。”尽管美国政府横加镇压，截至八月底，已有百万多人在世界保卫和平大会的和平宣言上签了名。
    该文又称：美国政府对中国留学生曾以“救济”的方式进行笼络，但是当“拉拢”的计划未收到效果时，就暴露了它的狰狞的面目，非法破坏进步的学生团体。留美科学工作者协会的被迫停止活动便是一个显著的例子。同时美国政府用种种卑劣手段监视我留美学生的言论行动，对回国的同学则多方阻挠。在“防止泄漏机密”的借口下，留美学生回国都成了问题。钱学森教授等被捕就是例子。
