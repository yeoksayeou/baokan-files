In Mourning for Comrade Ren Bishi
    Huang Yanpei
    Alas! Comrade Bishi:
    Only you and I, in Yan'an for five days of talks, a handshake at Tiananmen, our acquaintance was light, but our feelings were profound.
    You! Did not die from the poison of two prison guards, nor from thirty years of revolutionary struggle, but died in the year following the victory of the People's Liberation Army, at a time when American imperialism was rampant and the Korean border was sounding alarms.
    Nevertheless, may you rest in peace! Hundreds of millions of patriotic youths will uphold your teachings and follow in your footsteps. Your ambition will surely be fulfilled, and your name will be immortal!

　　哀任弼时同志
    黄炎培
    呜呼！弼时同志：
    惟我与君，延安五日谈，天门一握手，交虽淡，情至厚。
    君乎！不死于两番狱卒之毒刑，与三十年革命之战斗，乃死于人民解放军胜利的明年、美帝猖狂、朝边告警的时候。
    虽然，君其安息吧！有百千万亿爱国青年，秉君遗教，继君之后。君之志终必完成，君之名永垂不朽！
