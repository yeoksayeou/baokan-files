Record of Sins
More on the National Public Security Exhibition
Zhang Shikai

In the National Public Security Work Exhibition, behind the exhibition room of the crimes of American imperialist spies and agents, are various criminal pictures about the sabotage and destruction of the Kuomintang special agent bandit gangs. From these pictures, we can clearly see that the Kuomintang remnants and bandits are extremely viciously poisoning the Chinese people.

In the center of the exhibition room, a glass cabinet full of bloody clothes is displayed. This is what was left behind after General Li Zhaolin (original name Zhang Shoujian), a famous anti-Japanese general in Northeast China, was assassinated by Kuomintang agents. During the Anti-Japanese War, General Li was the commander-in-chief of the Third Route Army of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army. He led the people of Northeast China to resist the Japanese invaders and carried out heroic and tenacious struggles, and had established outstanding achievements in the cause of liberation of the Chinese people. After the "August 15th" surrender of the Japanese invaders, our army liberated Harbin. At that time, General Zhaolin was the representative of the Chinese Communist Party in Harbin and the president of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and was loved by the broad masses of the people. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries feared the development of the people's power and secretly instructed their special agent bandits He Shiying and Yan Zhongzhang to assassinate General Zhaolin on March 9, 1946. Some of the murderers have received their due punishment. A photo shows the scene of bandit Yan Zhongzhang being executed under the angry gazes of the crowd.

Secretly setting up radio stations to collect intelligence is a common trick of Kuomintang agents. Here is a set of photos of the case of the bandit "Northeast Supervisory Office of the Confidential Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, Shenyang Station" that was cracked. This case occurred in early 1948, when our army was launching a fierce winter offensive in Northeast China. The bandit "Confidential Bureau" telegraphed its special agent organization, ordering four groups of radio stations lurking in Shenyang to operate within a week, in an attempt to continue intelligence activities after our army liberated Shenyang. After the liberation of Shenyang, our people's public security organs successively cracked these lurking radio stations, arrested the special agent bandits, and seized two preparation stations hidden in the coffin of the Bao'an Temple and under the root of the stone bridge on the shore of Changzhao Lake. These two preparation stations were both American-style C.M.S portable radio stations.

All the pictures of the huge spy case of bandit agent Ji Zhaoxiang, which was cracked in Beijing on February 26 this year, are also on display here. Before the liberation of Beijing, bandit Ji was ordered by Chen Gongshu (a military intelligence agent), the captain of the "North China First Brigade of the Pacification Headquarters" of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, to lurk in Beijing and serve as the "head of the lurking station of the Beiping sub-station" of the brigade, engaging in intelligence sabotage activities, and using various methods to infiltrate the North China National Medical College and the Zhoukoudian China Kiln Company as cover. While cracking the case and arresting bandit Ji and others, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau seized an American-style DC/AC 15-watt radio station, four codebooks, and draft copies of telegrams, an American-style revolver and other documents in bandit Ji's secret room at No. 7 Nancha, Ciqiku, in the inner six districts. On June 2 this year, the Military Control Commission Military Law Office of Beijing Municipality, in accordance with the principle of "the ringleader must be punished," executed bandit Ji.

The remnant bandits in Taiwan also dispatched a large number of agents to sneak into the mainland in an attempt to launch armed rebellion. The pictures include the cases of the bandit agents of the "First and Second Columns of the Shandong People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army" that were cracked. The lurking bandit agents recruited bandits such as Jiang Zhenyu in Shandong, and haunted the borders of Laoshan, Jiaoxian, Laiyang, Jimo and other counties, carrying out so-called "guerrilla" activities and looting the people everywhere. In May this year, our people's public security forces wiped them out in one fell swoop and captured all the personnel below the rank of deputy commander of the bandit column. In February of this year, the Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau cracked the entire gang of 64 bandits involved in three major robbery cases. These bandits committed as many as 65 cases before and after liberation, killing more than 20 people. Among them, bandit agents Zhu Yupu and others directly gathered Chiang Kai-shek's scattered soldiers, bandits and hooligans in the name of the "Tianjin Sub-station of the China Youth Anti-Communist Underground Army" to carry out various terrorist activities.

The exhibition room also displays various sabotage situations carried out by bandit agents against our economic construction. Here are the photos of the case of bandit agents Feng Juxiang and others plotting to blow up the Yellow River Iron Bridge. Bandit Feng attempted to destroy the locomotives on the Jinghan Railway and the generators of the Jiaozuo Hydropower Company. It was cracked by us in advance in September two years ago. Sixty-three kilograms of yellow explosives and various burying and explosion materials were seized. The principal culprits Feng Juxiang and He Gongchen have been executed by firing squad. There are also various explanatory pictures and models of the case of special agent Tian Feng sabotaging the locomotive. In August this year, the criminal secretly destroyed the cylinder of our locomotive Mi Qi 1586, damaging six important parts and causing a loss of more than 26.04 million yuan to the people's property. After Tian Feng was captured by us, he confessed that the case was instigated by Li Dianchen, a special agent of the bandit "Central Bureau of Statistics."

In addition to these, bandit agents also counterfeit banknotes to disrupt the people's finance; they use various reactionary secret societies (such as Shengxiandao, Yiguandao, etc.) to confuse the masses, spread rumors and cause trouble, and obstruct the masses from producing with peace of mind.

All these counter-revolutionary bandit agent sabotage activities have been severely punished by our people's public security organs and public security forces. In the nearly one year from October last year to September this year, more than 13,000 special agents and saboteurs have been captured successively, and 175 lurking radio stations have been seized, as well as a large number of telecommunications equipment, codebooks, long and short guns, ammunition, documents, secret orders and counterfeit official seals. The special agents who were captured, except for the ringleaders and incorrigible counter-revolutionaries who have been severely punished, the accomplices are given labor reform, lenient treatment, and a way out of life. In another corner of the exhibition room, there are many scenes of reforming these special agent bandits. The state-owned Qinghe Farm, with an area of more than 70,000 mu, is one of them. In this farm, the general special agent criminals are transformed in labor reform, organizing them to collective labor, such as building shacks, digging canals, pumping water and digging mud, cutting grass and transplanting rice, sowing seeds and fertilizing, etc., and they are also learning various production skills such as surveying and the use of diesel engines. In labor and learning, they gradually change their past parasitic ideas of despising labor, despising the working people, and relying solely on sucking the blood and sweat of the working people for a living. From the many labor pictures here, we can see that only by bowing to the people, recognizing one's own mistakes, and transforming oneself well in labor, will the people forgive their past crimes.

    罪恶的纪录
    再记全国公安展览会
    张世楷
    全国公安工作展览会里，在美帝特务间谍罪行展览室的后面，是关于国民党特务匪帮捣乱破坏的各种罪恶图片。从这些图片里面，可以清楚地看出国民党残余匪帮穷凶极恶的毒害着中国人民。
    展览室的中心，陈设着一个堆满血衣的玻璃橱。这是东北抗日名将李兆麟（原名张寿篯）将军被国民党特务刺杀后所遗留下来的。抗日期间，李将军是东北抗日联军第三路军总指挥，他领导着东北人民反抗日寇侵略，进行英勇顽强的斗争，曾经在中国人民解放事业上建立了卓越的功勋。“八一五”日寇投降后，我军解放了哈尔滨市，当时兆麟将军是中国共产党哈市的代表，兼中苏友好协会会长，受到了广大人民的爱戴。但是，国民党反动派畏惧人民力量的发展，暗地里指使其特务匪徒何世英、阎钟章等于一九四六年三月九日将兆麟将军刺杀了。凶手有的已得到他应得的惩罚，一张照片印着阎匪钟章在众目怒视之下伏法的情形。
    密设电台搜集情报，是国民党特务的惯技。这里挂着一组被破获的匪“国防部保密局东北督导室沈阳站”案件的照片。这案件发生于一九四八年初，时正当我军在东北发动猛烈的冬季攻势。匪“保密局”电示其特务组织，限令一星期内在沈阳潜伏四个组的电台，妄图于我军解放沈阳后，继续进行情报活动。沈阳解放后，我人民公安机关就连续破获了这些潜伏电台，逮捕了特务匪徒，并搜出藏在保安寺灵柩里与长沼湖畔石桥根下的两部准备台。这两部准备台都是美式Ｃ·Ｍ·Ｓ手提型电台。
    今年二月二十六日，在北京破获了匪特计兆祥巨大间谍案的全部图片，也在这里展览。在北京解放前，计匪受蒋匪“绥靖总队华北第一大队”队长陈恭澍（军统特务）的命令潜伏北京，充任该总队“北平分台潜伏台长”，从事情报破坏活动，利用各种方法混入华北国医学院与周口店中华窑业公司，以为掩护。北京市人民政府公安局在破获该案逮捕计匪等的同时，在内六区磁器库南岔七号计匪暗室内搜出了美式直流交流十五瓦电台一部，密码四本，以及收发报稿底，美式左轮手枪等证件。今年六月二日，北京市军管会军法处，根据“首恶者必办”的原则，已将计匪处决。
    台湾残匪还派遣大批特务潜入大陆，企图发动武装叛乱。图片中有被破获的“山东人民反共救国军第一、二纵队”匪特案。潜伏的匪特在山东网罗了散匪江振钰等，出没于崂山、胶县、莱阳、即墨等县的边境，进行所谓“游击”活动，到处抢掠人民。今年五月间，我人民公安部队将其一举剿灭，活捉了匪副纵队长以下全部人员。本年二月间，天津市公安局破获了三大股匪抢劫案全部匪犯六十四人。这些匪徒在解放前后作案达六十五件之多，杀害了二十余人。其中匪特朱玉璞等并直接以“中国青年剿共地下军天津分站”的名义纠合蒋匪散兵游勇、惯匪流氓进行各种恐怖活动。
    展览室里同时展示着匪特对我经济建设进行了的各种破坏情形。这里有匪特冯聚祥等阴谋爆炸黄河铁桥案件的照片，冯匪企图毁坏京汉路机车和焦作水电公司的发电机。前年九月间，已为我事先破获。搜出黄色炸药六十三斤，各种埋藏爆炸材器多种。主犯冯聚祥、何功臣已执行枪决。这里还有特务田丰破坏机车案的各种说明图片与模型。该犯于本年八月间暗中将我冖丂１５８６号机车汽缸破坏，损毁了六处重要机件，使人民财产损失达二千六百零四万余元。田丰经我捕获后，供认该案为匪“中统”特务李殿臣所指使。
    除了这些以外，匪特还假造钞票，捣乱人民的金融；利用各种反动会道门（如圣贤道、一贯道等），用以迷惑群众，造谣滋事，阻挠群众安心生产。
    所有这些反革命的匪特破坏活动，在我人民公安机关与公安部队严厉的镇压之下，已经受到了他们应得的惩处。自去年十月至今年九月近一年的时间内，就先后捕获了特务破坏分子一万三千余人，搜出潜伏电台一百七十五部，他如电讯材器、密码本、长短枪、弹药、文件、密令及伪关防印章等也收缴了很多。这些被捕获的特务，除首恶和怙恶不悛的反革命分子已予严厉惩办外，对于胁从分子则给以劳动改造，宽大处理，并给以生活出路。在展览室的另一角，就出现了许多改造这些特务匪犯的场面。面积约七万多亩的国营清河农场就是其中之一。在这个农场里，使一般的特务罪犯在劳动改造中走向新生，组织他们集体劳动，如搭建窝棚、开凿河渠、抽水挖泥、斩草插秧、播种施肥等，他们并学习着各种生产技能如测量术，使用柴油机等。在劳动与学习中逐步地改变着他们过去轻视劳动、轻视劳动人民，专靠吮吸劳动人民血汗为生的寄生思想。从这里许多劳动的图片里，我们可以看出：只有向人民低头，认识自己的过错，好好的在劳动中改造自己，人民才会宽恕他们以往的罪行的。
