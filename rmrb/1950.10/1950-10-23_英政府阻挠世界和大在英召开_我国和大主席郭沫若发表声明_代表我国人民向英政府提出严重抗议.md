Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd: Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, issued a statement protesting the British government's obstruction of the Second World Peace Congress from convening in Sheffield, England. The full text of the statement is as follows:

　　The solemn Stockholm Peace Appeal has, in the past half year, won the signatures of nearly 500 million people worldwide.

　　The world's forces for peace are undoubtedly growing stronger. The Executive Bureau of the World Peace Congress has decided to convene the Second World Peace Congress in Sheffield, England, in mid-November to oppose imperialist aggressive war. The Executive Bureau originally planned to hold a preparatory meeting in London on the 2nd of this month, but it was obstructed by the British government in many ways, making it impossible for the preparatory meeting to be held in British territory. According to the information we have, the British government's unreasonable obstruction includes the following: Executive Secretary-General Lafferte had already flown to London but was restricted at the airport and forced to leave the country. Italian Socialist leader Nenni, Soviet Peace Committee Chairman Tikhonov, and famous writers Ehrenburg and Korneichuk have all been similarly refused entry. Such fascist and reactionary measures only further prove that the British government is controlled by American imperialism. Not only has it acted as an accomplice of American imperialism in the United Nations General Assembly and in the war of aggression against Korea, but it has also gone further in echoing American imperialism, hating peace, and preparing to be an enemy of peace-loving people all over the world. This has aroused universal indignation in the hearts of peace-loving people all over the world. I hereby lodge a severe protest with the British government on behalf of the people of our country and demand that the British people quickly rise up to correct this absurd behavior of the British government. This absurd behavior of the British government can only expose its own ugly face and can never stop the advance of the powerful world peace movement. The fog of London cannot shroud the sunlight that shines over the earth.

　　英政府阻挠世界和大在英召开
    我国和大主席郭沫若发表声明
    代表我国人民向英政府提出严重抗议
    【新华社二十二日讯】中国保卫世界和平大会主席郭沫若发表声明，抗议英国政府阻挠在英国色斐尔德召开第二次世界拥护和平大会。声明全文如下：
    斯德哥尔摩庄严的和平宣言，半年来已经赢得了全世界近五亿人民的签名。
    全世界和平力量无疑地是日益壮大了。世界拥护和平大会执行局已决于十一月中旬在英国色斐尔德召开第二次世界拥护和平大会，反对帝国主义的侵略战争。和大执行局原定本月二日先在伦敦开会筹备，但是遭受英国政府多方阻挠，使筹备会竟无法在英国境内召开。据我们所知道的消息，英国政府的无理阻挠有这样的几项。执行局秘书长拉斐德已飞抵伦敦，在机场遭受限制，被迫离境。意大利社会党领袖南尼、苏联和大主席吉洪诺夫及名作家爱伦堡、柯尔涅丘克等均同样遭受拒绝。像这样法西斯主义的反动措施，就愈加证明英国政府受美帝国主义的控制，不仅在联合国大会中，在侵略朝鲜战争中，已经做了美帝国主义的帮凶，而且更进一步附和美帝国主义，仇视和平，准备与全世界爱好和平的人民为敌。这在全世界爱好和平的人民心中已引起了普遍的义愤。我特代表我国人民向英国政府提出严重的抗议，并要求英国人民迅速起来纠正英国政府的这种悖谬行为。英国政府的这种悖谬行为只能暴露自己的丑恶面目，而绝对不能阻挠强大的世界和平运动的前进。伦敦的迷雾是笼罩不了普照大地的太阳光线的。
