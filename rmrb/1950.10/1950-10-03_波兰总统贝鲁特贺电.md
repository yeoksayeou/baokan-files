Xinhua News Agency, 30th. President Bierut of the Republic of Poland sent a telegram to Chairman Mao congratulating him on our National Day. The telegram is as follows: To Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China:

Mr. Chairman, on the occasion of the National Day of the People's Republic of China, I would like to extend my most sincere congratulations to the Chinese people and to you personally in the name of the Polish people and myself. The resolute and heroic struggle of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people against imperialism and its puppets, which they have persisted in for decades at the cost of the greatest sacrifices, is now the object of joy and sympathy for the Polish people. The Polish people watch with such sympathy all the victories of the Chinese people in the cause of restoring and building their motherland after their liberation from the shackles of imperialist exploitation. The great victory of the Chinese people has inspired all the people who are fighting for the liberation of their motherland. This victory is a great contribution to the struggle for peace waged by the progressive and democratic camp under the leadership of the Soviet Union throughout the world. Today, as the heroic Chinese people have taken their rightful place in the family of the world's free people and are massively engaged in building a socialist system, the Polish people wish the Chinese people further victories in their struggle to liberate the remaining territories and to achieve the task of consolidating peace and democracy.

Bierut, September 29th
