　　Great Friendship, Great Strength!
    ——A Record of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Work Exhibition
    By our reporter Cheng Guangrui
    With the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the birth of the People's Republic of China, the people of China and the Soviet Union have united in brotherly friendship without any hindrance. The brotherly friendship of the seven hundred million people of these two great nations has seen tremendous development in the past year. On October 5th, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Work Exhibition" at the Cultural Palace of the Working People, starting from the first anniversary of its establishment. This exhibition uses vivid facts to illustrate the specific achievements of friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union under the great banner of internationalism over the past year.
    The exhibition is divided into three pavilions: National, Lushun-Dalian, and Beijing. In the more than one thousand photographs and statistical tables on display, the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union is fully expressed. In the "Great Friendship" section of the National Pavilion, we can see that on the first day of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet delegation of cultural, artistic, and scientific workers, headed by Fadeyev, brought us the great friendship of the Soviet people from distant Moscow. They participated in the grand founding ceremony in Tiananmen Square, cheering for the victory of the Chinese people and the birth of the new China. Commander-in-Chief Zhu De's announcement at the Chinese People's Conference for World Peace that the Soviet Union was the first to establish diplomatic relations with the new China was met with an extraordinarily moving scene of fervent cheers.
    Last December, Chairman Mao visited Moscow and met with the great leader of the world's working people, Marshal Stalin, doing a great service for the Chinese people: On February 14th of this year, China and the Soviet Union signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. This treaty, with its great historical significance, ushered in a new era of Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation. From a series of photographs, we can see the people of China cheering for this epoch-making document, cheering for the Soviet Union's selfless assistance to China, and cheering for the powerful guarantee of peace in the Far East and the world.
    The birthday of Stalin, the great leader of the world's working people, has become a festival for the people of the world. On December 21st of last year, when Stalin turned seventy, people all over our country celebrated this festival in a frenzy to celebrate the birthday of the best friend of the Chinese people. A series of photos record the enthusiastic scenes of people presenting flags, longevity peaches, embroidered portraits, and holding gatherings.
    In May of this year, the Soviet Youth Delegation, headed by Mikhailov, came to China and visited many cities and villages in China, receiving a warm welcome from people and youth everywhere. Chinese youth are enthusiastically learning from the example of Soviet youth. The story of Soviet hero Kozhedub, who shot down sixty-two German planes in the Soviet Patriotic War, has been passed down among Chinese youth.
    Here, we can also see the situation of the Chinese delegation, headed by Ding Ling, visiting Moscow. The delegation included Li Yong, the famous driver of the "Mao Zedong" train. Chinese workers, scientists, and writers are humbly learning from the Soviet Union's experience in building the country.
    Over the past year, our Soviet friends have continuously introduced the Soviet Union's construction experience and achievements to the Chinese people. The statistical tables in the exhibition illustrate these facts: During their thirty-four-day visit to China, the Soviet delegation of cultural, artistic, and scientific workers attended mass rallies, participated in symposiums and lectures, and held more than one hundred musical and dance performances, with nearly two million people attending these events. Since March of last year, seven Soviet experts who were invited to lecture in China one after another have given 209 lectures and seminars in major cities of our country, with more than 200,000 listeners. Some photos record touching friendships: The selfless work of the Soviet anti-epidemic team in capturing and exterminating plague in Chahar Province is unforgettable in the hearts of the people of Chahar Province. In Dalian, Soviet technicians trained the first batch of female conductors in the new China. Zhao Guilan, the famous model of protecting the factory and a good daughter of the Communist Party, was rescued by the enthusiastic medical treatment of Soviet doctor Freyscher in Dalian. In factories all over China, there are Soviet experts training batches of new technicians. These facts all illustrate how our Soviet friends, with their great internationalist education, are selflessly helping the economic and cultural construction of the new China.
    In Beijing, the organization of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has developed rapidly, expanding from the city to the countryside, with more than 190,000 citizens participating in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Sino-Soviet Friendship Halls have been established in cultural centers in suburban districts, and Friendship Association reading rooms have been established in many schools. The Friendship Association regularly holds study classes for street branch team leaders to train cadres for grassroots work in the Friendship Association. The Friendship Association uses film screenings, photo exhibitions, and the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Voice" broadcast to introduce Soviet economic, cultural, scientific, and artistic knowledge.
    In the Lushun-Dalian Pavilion, we can see even more clearly that, under the direct assistance of the Soviet Union, Lushun-Dalian's production and construction have developed by leaps and bounds in the past five years. Soviet technicians teach us the advanced scientific achievements of the Soviet Union, enabling our workers to master advanced technology. Thanks to the help of the Soviet Union, the workers of Dalian have obtained a happy life. On the hillside facing the sea in Tiger Beach, Dalian, a place that was still a wilderness half a year ago, the Sino-Soviet joint venture Dalian Far East Electric Power Company built a rest palace for electric power workers with Soviet funding. We can see from the photos that workers spend a pleasant life on this beautiful seaside during their half-month vacation.
    The work of the Lushun-Dalian Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has been widely and deeply integrated into all levels of people. The Friendship Association uses various methods such as report meetings, symposiums, get-togethers, reading groups, dance classes, Russian classes, movies, slide shows, dramas, radio broadcasts, mobile library cars, and photo exhibitions to carry out the publicity and education work of Sino-Soviet friendship. The number of Friendship Association members in the Lushun-Dalian area has grown to more than 240,000, accounting for one-half of the total population of Lushun-Dalian.
    In the signature campaign to defend world peace, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in various places have played a great role. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in various places use urban and rural branches to organize publicity, education, and signature collection work. Members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association are also peace fighters. Gao Yuquan, Zhang Yangshi, and Ren Shuhua, famous peace fighters in Beijing, are all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.
    The friendly unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union is of great significance to the people of the whole world. Chairman Mao said: "The unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union is extremely important. If the people of these two countries are united, the unity of the people of the world will not be difficult." From the exhibition, we can see that in the past year, the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people has developed rapidly. At the same time, we believe that this friendship will continue to develop in the future and become a great force for defending world peace and opposing wars of aggression.

　　伟大的友谊，伟大的力量！
    ——记中苏友协工作展览会
    本报记者  程光锐
    随着中国人民革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的诞生，中苏两国人民已经毫无阻拦地以兄弟般的友谊团结了起来。这两大国家七亿人民的兄弟般的友谊，在过去的一年中有着巨大的发展。十月五日，中苏友好协会总会从她成立一周年纪念这一天起，在劳动人民文化宫举办了“中苏友协工作展览会”，这个展览会用生动的事实，说明一年来中苏两国在伟大的国际主义旗帜下友好与合作的具体收获。
    展览会分为全国、旅大、北京三馆，在展览的一千多幅照片和统计表中，充分表现着中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊。在全国馆的“伟大的友谊”一栏中，我们可以看到：中华人民共和国成立的第一天，以法捷耶夫为首的苏联文化、艺术、科学工作者代表团，从遥远的莫斯科给我们带来了苏联人民伟大的友情，他们参加了天安门前的盛大的开国典礼，为中国人民的胜利和新中国的诞生而欢呼。朱德总司令在中国保卫和平大会上宣布了苏联首先与新中国建立邦交，当时狂热欢呼的场面是异常动人的。
    去年十二月，毛主席访问了莫斯科，会晤了世界劳动人民的伟大领袖斯大林大元帅，给中国人民办了一件大喜事：今年二月十四日，中苏两国签订了中苏友好同盟互助条约。这个具有着伟大历史意义的条约，开始了中苏友好合作的新时代。从一组照片中，我们可以看到全中国人民为这一个划时代的文献而欢呼，为苏联对中国大公无私的援助而欢呼，为远东与世界的和平得到了强有力的保障而欢呼。
    世界劳动人民的伟大领袖斯大林的生日已成为全世界人民的节日了。去年十二月二十一日，斯大林七十大寿时，我国各地人民都为庆祝这位中国人民最好的朋友的寿辰而狂欢地度过这个节日。有一组照片记载着人民在献旗、献寿桃、献绣像、举行集会的热烈场面。
    今年五月，以米哈依洛夫为首的苏联青年代表团来到了中国，访问了中国的许多城市和乡村，受到各地人民和青年热烈欢迎。中国青年都热烈学习苏联青年的榜样。曾在苏联卫国战争中打下六十二架德寇飞机的苏联英雄阔日杜布的故事，一直为中国青年们传诵着。
    在这里，我们也可以看到以丁玲为首的中国代表团访问莫斯科的情形，代表团中包括著名的“毛泽东号”列车司机长李永。中国的工人、科学家、作家虚心地向苏联学习建设国家的经验。
    一年来，我们的苏联朋友不断地把苏联建设的经验和成就介绍给中国人民。展览会的统计表中说明了这些事实：苏联文化、艺术、科学工作者代表团在访问中国的三十四天中，出席群众大会、参加座谈会和演讲会、举行音乐舞蹈会计一百次以上，参加这些会的听众近二百万人。去年三月以来，应邀先后来中国讲学的七位苏联专家，在我国主要城市演讲座谈二百零九次，听众有二十多万人。在一些照片中记录着感人的友情：苏联防疫队在察北捕灭鼠疫的忘我工作，在察北人民心中是永志不忘的。在大连，苏联的技师培养了第一批新中国的女乘务员。在大连的苏联大夫弗列依舍尔热心的医疗下，著名的护厂模范、共产党的好女儿赵桂兰得救了。在中国各地的工厂里，都有苏联专家在培养一批批的新的技工。这些事实，都说明了我们的有着伟大国际主义教养的苏联朋友们，是如何忘我地帮助新中国经济和文化的建设。
    在北京，中苏友协的组织迅速地发展，从城市扩展到农村，已有十九万以上的市民参加了中苏友好协会。城郊各区的文化馆都设立了中苏友好馆，许多学校里设立了友协阅览室。友协经常举办街道支会小组长学习班，训练友协基层工作的干部。友协用放映电影、展览照片、“中苏友声”的广播来介绍苏联的经济、文化、科学、艺术各方面的知识。
    在旅大馆中，我们更可以看到，五年来，在苏联的直接援助下，旅大的生产建设飞跃的发展着。苏联技师把苏联的科学高度成就教给我们，使我们的工人掌握高度的技术。由于苏联的帮助，大连的工人获得了幸福的生活。在大连老虎滩面海的山坡上，半年前还是一片荒野的地方，中苏合营的大连远东电业公司，由苏方出资兴建了电业工人休息宫。我们可以从照片中看到，工人们在半个月的假期中，在这美丽的海滨度过着愉快的生活。
    旅大的中苏友协工作已普遍深入各阶层人民中去，友协利用报告会、座谈会、联欢会、读书会、舞蹈班、俄语班、电影、幻灯、戏剧、广播、流动图书车、照片展览等各种方式进行中苏友好的宣传教育工作，旅大地区友协会员已发展至二十四万多人，占全旅大人口的二分之一。
    在保卫世界和平签名运动中，各地中苏友协发挥了很大的作用。各地中苏友协利用城乡分支会组织，进行宣传、教育及征集签名工作。中苏友协的会员也就是和平战士。北京著名的和平战士高玉泉、张杨氏和任淑华，都是中苏友协的会员。
    中苏两国人民的友好团结，对于全世界人民说来是有巨大的意义的。毛主席说：“中苏两国人民的团结极为重要，这两国人民团结一致了，世界人民的团结就不困难了。”从展览会中，我们可以看到：在过去一年中，中苏人民友谊迅速地发展着，同时，我们相信，这种友谊今后也将不断地发展；而成为保卫世界和平、反对侵略战争的伟大力量。
