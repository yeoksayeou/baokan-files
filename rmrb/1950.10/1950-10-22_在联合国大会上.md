　　At the United Nations General Assembly
    En Haling
    The Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly has been in session for over two weeks. During this time, most countries' delegations have clearly stated their positions on the tasks facing the United Nations in consolidating the cause of peace and cooperation among all peoples. The General Assembly has adopted a series of resolutions that clearly illustrate the characteristics of the path that the US-UK bloc is desperately trying to lead the United Nations down. At the same time, it also reveals another completely opposite path, the one that the Soviet Union, with the support of other peace-loving and democratic countries, is promoting and adhering to in the General Assembly.
    The opening meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on September 19 marked a direct conflict in international politics between two lines—the Soviet line and the US-UK line—on the issue of the Kuomintang representatives attending the Assembly and the issue of inviting representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to attend the Assembly. In its proposal, the Soviet delegation considered it intolerable for representatives of the Kuomintang remnants to participate in the Assembly and its affiliated bodies. It also proposed inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend and participate in the work of the Assembly. However, due to the United States activating its "voting machine," the Assembly rejected the Soviet proposal and adopted the Canadian proposal, the first part of which recommended the establishment of a special committee to review the issue of Chinese representation "after the Assembly discusses item 62 of the provisional agenda." The second part stipulated that "until the Assembly makes a decision based on the report of this special committee, the Kuomintang representatives will continue to attend the Assembly, with the same rights as other representatives."
    From September 20 to 28, the Assembly held plenary sessions. The speech by Soviet representative Vyshinsky became the focus of attention for all representatives and guests of the Assembly. In his speech to the plenary session of the Assembly on September 20, Vyshinsky presented irrefutable evidence exposing the US policy of preparing for a new war and clearly put forward the tasks currently facing the United Nations in ensuring universal peace and consolidating cooperation among all peoples.
    On behalf of the Soviet government, Vyshinsky submitted a proposal to the Assembly for consideration of a "Declaration on Removing the Threat of a New War and Strengthening Peace and Security among Nations." The declaration included the following recommendations: condemnation and prohibition of propaganda for a new war; prohibition of atomic weapons and establishment of international supervision to verify the implementation of this ban; declaring any government that first uses atomic weapons against another country to be a war criminal; the five powers—the United States, Britain, France, China, and the Soviet Union—should conclude a pact to consolidate peace; and the five powers should disarm by one-third in 1950.
    The "Declaration on Removing the Threat of a New War and Strengthening Peace and Security among Nations" submitted by the Soviet delegation to the Assembly for consideration opened up a practical path for mankind to move towards guaranteeing lasting peace. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Soviet proposal was fiercely opposed by the delegations of the countries of the Anglo-American bloc. British Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a speech at the plenary session held on September 25, opposing the Soviet proposal calling for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. He praised the American aggression in Korea and at the same time made vicious slanders against the Soviet Union. French Foreign Minister Schuman also spoke against the Soviet proposal, supporting American armed intervention in Korea. The representative of the Tito group, Kardelj, also participated very vigorously in the slander against the Soviet Union and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
    The American vassal states in the United Nations opposed the Soviet proposal and supported the proposal put forward by Acheson at the plenary session of the Assembly held on September 20. The proposal contained four recommendations: stipulating that if the Security Council is unable to take action "against acts of aggression or breaches of the peace," the Assembly should convene a special session "within twenty-four hours"; establishing "security patrols" with member states of the United Nations allocating a portion of their troops to act "under the mandate of the United Nations"; and the Assembly should establish a committee to study methods of so-called collective action, including the use of force. It is not difficult to see that the entire meaning of Acheson's proposal is to reduce and weaken the role of the Security Council, which adheres to the principle of great power unanimity. In other words, Acheson's proposal is to extensively revise the Charter of the United Nations in order to turn the United Nations into a docile tool of American aggressive policy with the help of the "voting machine."
    During the discussion of the agenda, the actions of the representatives of the US-UK bloc clearly exposed the US intention to drag the UN General Assembly onto a path that has nothing in common with the road to peace. Therefore, at the meetings of the General Committee on September 21 and 22, many issues that were intended to hinder the United Nations from fulfilling its responsibility to consolidate universal peace were placed on the agenda of the Assembly. Among these issues were the case of "threats to the political independence and territorial integrity of Greece," which was put forward to divert the Assembly's attention from the constant terror being carried out by the Greek fascist royalists; the so-called case of "threats to the political independence and territorial integrity of China" put forward by the Kuomintang bandits; the case of "the situation in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania regarding respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms" put forward by the British and American imperialists to cover up their interference in the internal affairs of the people's democratic countries; the issue of relations with Spain, which was intended to rescind the United Nations resolution of December 12, 1946, regarding Franco's Spain; the accusation of the so-called "Soviet failure to fulfill the repatriation of German and Japanese prisoners of war"; and the issue of "prohibition of the use of radio call signs to disrupt reporting in other countries," which falls under the item of "freedom of information" and was intended to slander certain countries. However, the General Committee also had to include the Soviet complaint about American aggression against China on the agenda.
    On September 26, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the agenda submitted by the General Committee for consideration, and adopted the recommendation to allocate the issues on the agenda to the various committees for discussion; the Assembly also adopted the General Committee's recommendation to establish a Special Political Committee.
    The Political Committee and the Special Political Committee began their work on September 30. The Special Political Committee elected Peruvian representative Belaunde as its chairman and met on October 2 to discuss the US-UK accusation that Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania had violated the human rights clauses in the peace treaties. The representatives of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, Belarus, and the Soviet Union thoroughly exposed this provocative act in their speeches. This was launched by the United States in an attempt to divert international public opinion from the bankruptcy of the conspiracies of the US and British imperialists against these countries under the guise of "guaranteeing people's basic rights". However, the Anglo-American majority still passed the Australian proposal to slander Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania.
    The Political Committee began discussing the Korean issue on September 30. Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, delivered a long speech on this issue on October 2. He used many conclusive facts to prove that the United States had carried out barbarous acts of aggression against the Korean people—armed intervention in the internal affairs of Korea. Vyshinsky firmly refuted the draft resolution on the Korean issue by the US-UK bloc, which was proposed by the representatives of eight countries and aimed at the occupation of the entire territory of Korea by foreign troops.
    In response to the "Eight-Nation Proposal," the delegations of the Soviet Union, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia submitted a joint proposal on the issue of Korean independence to the Political Committee for review on October 2. This proposal recommended: that the warring parties immediately cease military operations; that the United States government and the governments of other countries immediately withdraw their troops from Korea; that democratic national assembly elections be held throughout Korea in the shortest possible time after the withdrawal of foreign troops; that a United Nations commission be established to supervise the conduct of the elections, and that this commission must include representatives of countries bordering Korea; that the United Nations provide the Korean people with necessary economic and technical assistance; and that the Security Council review the issue of admitting Korea to the United Nations after the establishment of a government throughout Korea. However, the "voting machine" was activated on October 5, and the eight-nation resolution was passed.
    It can be seen that in the initial two weeks of the work of the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, a broad conspiracy against peace and against the United Nations, led by the United States and Britain, has already emerged. At the same time, the sharp political struggle unfolding in the United Nations General Assembly points out that the Soviet Union is standing unswervingly and firmly on its position of peaceful settlement of all international issues, and on the position of consolidating the United Nations organization and using it as an important tool for safeguarding peace and universal security.

### 在联合国大会上

　　在联合国大会上
    恩·哈林
    联合国第五届大会自开始工作以来已有二个多星期了。在这期间内，大部分国家的代表团对于在巩固各族人民的和平和合作的事业中摆在联合国面前的任务，已明确地表示了它们的立场。大会通过一系列决议，足够明确地说明美英集团拚命驱使联合国走向的那条道路的特点。同时它也显现了性质完全与其相反的另一条路线，就是苏联在其他爱好和平的民主国家的支持下在大会上推行并坚持的路线。
    九月十九日联合国大会揭幕会议中，标志了国际政治中对国民党代表出席大会问题和邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府代表出席大会问题的两条路线——苏联路线和美英路线——的正面冲突。苏联代表团在自己的提案中认为国民党残余匪帮代表参加大会及其所属各机构是不可容忍的。它同时提议邀请中华人民共和国代表出席参加大会的工作。但是由于美国开动了“表决机器”，大会否决了苏联的提案，通过了加拿大的提案，其第一部分建议成立特别委员会在“大会讨论临时议程第六十二项以后”审议中国代表权问题。其第二部分规定“在大会根据这一特别委员会的报告作出决定以前，国民党代表仍出席大会，与其他代表有同样的权利。”
    九月二十日至二十八日大会举行全体会议。苏联代表维辛斯基的发言成了全体代表和大会贵宾注意的焦点。维辛斯基在九月二十日大会全体会议上的演说中，证据确凿地揭露了美国推行着准备新战争的政策，明确地提出了目前摆在联合国面前确保普遍和平和巩固各族人民合作的任务。
    维辛斯基奉苏联政府之命，向大会提出“制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全宣言”的提案，请求审议。该项宣言包括下列几点建议：谴责与禁止新战争宣传；禁止原子武器，并建立国际监督借以检查此项禁令的实施；宣布任何首先对他国使用原子武器的政府为战争罪犯；美英法中苏五国缔结巩固和平的公约；五国在一九五○年内裁军三分之一。
    苏联代表团提交大会审议的“制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全宣言”，为人类开辟了走向保障持久和平的实际道路。因此，苏联提案遭到英美集团各国代表团的激烈反对是不足为奇的。英国外长贝文在九月二十五日举行的全体会议上发表演说，反对要求裁军及禁止原子武器的苏联提案。他歌颂美国在朝鲜的侵略，同时对苏联进行了恶言的诽谤。法国外长舒曼亦发言反对苏联提案，支持美国在朝鲜的武装干涉。铁托集团的代表卡德尔亦非常卖力地参加了对苏联和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的诽谤。
    联合国中的美国附庸国家，反对苏联提案，支持艾奇逊在九月二十日举行的大会全体会议上所提出的提案。该项提案包含四条建议：规定如果安理会“对破坏和平或侵略行为”不能采取措施时，得“在二十四小时内”召开大会特别会议；建立“安全巡察队”，由联合国各会员国拨出一部分军队，“奉联合国之命”而行动；由大会成立一个委员会，研究包括武力的运用在内的所谓集体行动的办法。不难看出，艾奇逊全部提案的意思是要减低和削弱奉行着大国一致原则的安全理事会的作用。换句话说，艾奇逊的建议就是广泛地修改联合国的宪章，以便在“表决机器”的帮助下把联合国变成美国侵略政策的驯顺工具。
    在讨论议事日程的时候，美英集团代表们的行动清清楚楚地暴露出美国想把联合国大会拖到和走向和平的道路毫无共同之处的道路上去。因此在九月二十一日及二十二日的总务委员会会议中，将许多存心阻碍联合国为巩固普遍和平而尽其职责的问题放进了大会议程。在这些问题中有“对希腊政治独立和领土完整的威胁”案，提出的目的是转移大会对希腊法西斯保皇分子所不断进行的恐怖的注意；国民党匪帮提出的所谓“对中国政治独立和领土完整的威胁”案；英美帝国主义者为掩饰他们干涉人民民主国家内政而提出的“保加利亚、匈牙利和罗马尼亚尊重人权和基本自由的情形”案；为了打算取消联合国在一九四六年十二月十二日关于佛朗哥西班牙的决议而提出的与西班牙关系问题；控诉所谓“苏联未能履行遣送德日战俘”案；为诽谤某些国家而提出的、属于“报道自由”项下的“禁止利用无线电呼号扰乱其他国家报道”的问题。但总务委员会也不得不把苏联所提关于美国侵略中国的控诉案列入了议程。
    联合国大会在九月二十六日通过了总务委员会提请审议的议程，并且通过将议程中的问题分配给各委员会讨论的建议；大会同时还通过了总务委员会关于成立特别政治委员会的建议。
    政治委员会和特别政治委员会在九月三十日开始了工作。特别政治委员会举出秘鲁代表碧朗第为主席，在十月二日开会讨论美英诬告保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚违反和约中关于人权条款的问题。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、乌克兰、白俄罗斯和苏联的代表们在他们的演说中彻底揭露了这个挑衅举动。这是美国企图在“保障人们基本权利”的招牌下转移国际舆论对美英帝国主义者对这些国家进行的阴谋活动的破产的注意而发动的。但是英美集团的多数仍旧通过了澳大利亚所提诽谤保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚的提案。
    政治委员会自九月三十日开始讨论朝鲜问题。苏联代表团团长维辛斯基于十月二日对这问题发表了长篇演说。他用许多确凿的事实证明美国对朝鲜人民实行了蛮横的侵略行为——武装干涉朝鲜内部的事情。维辛斯基坚决驳斥美英集团关于朝鲜问题的决议草案，这个草案是由八国代表提出的，目的在于由外国军队占领全部朝鲜领土。
    针对“八国提案”，苏联、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的代表团于十月二日提请政治委员会审查他们关于朝鲜独立问题的联合提案。这个提案建议：交战双方立即停止军事行动；美国政府和其他国家政府立刻从朝鲜撤退它们的军队；外国军队撤退之后，于最短期间举行全朝鲜的民主的国民议会选举；为了监督选举的进行，设立一个联合国委员会，此委员会必须有和朝鲜接壤国家的代表参加；通过联合国给予朝鲜人民以必要的经济的与技术的援助；安全理事会在全朝鲜政府成立之后审查关于接纳朝鲜参加联合国的问题。但是“表决机器”于十月五日开动，通过了八国决议。
    由此可见，联合国第五届大会的工作在起初两星期中就已经显出存在着一个由美英领导的反对和平、反对联合国的广泛阴谋。同时在联合国大会上展开的尖锐的政治斗争指出，苏联是坚持不渝地和坚定地站在它的和平解决一切国际问题的立场上，站在巩固联合国机构和把它作为保卫和平与普遍安全的重要工具的立场上。【新华社】
