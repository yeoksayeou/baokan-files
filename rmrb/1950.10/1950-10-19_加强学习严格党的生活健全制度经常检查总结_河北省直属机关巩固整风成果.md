Strengthen Learning, Strictly Enforce Party Life, Improve Systems, Regularly Inspect and Summarize
Hebei Province Directly Subordinate Organs Consolidate Rectification Achievements

[Report from our newspaper] (Reporter Zhu Bo): The rectification movement in the directly subordinate organs of Hebei Province has basically come to an end. The various organs have now entered the stage of improving work and consolidating the achievements of the rectification.

During this rectification, the main problems discovered in the work of the directly subordinate organs of Hebei Province were: (1) In terms of policy implementation, it was generally correct from the overall leadership perspective. However, some organs also experienced some deviations in the implementation of policies. For example, the Education Department did not pay enough attention to the policy of worker-peasant education, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative did not have a clear understanding of the ideas of "mass management of cooperatives" and "democratic management," the Provincial Taxation Bureau did not have a clear understanding of the policies of taxation work, and the Provincial People's Court had some deviations in the implementation of the policy of "suppressing counter-revolutionary elements." This caused no small losses to the work. (2) Bureaucratic style of work: The leadership methods of various organs and departments generally have the shortcomings of assigning a lot of work, and some of it is not realistic, with little specific help and inspection. Some leading comrades are busy all day with meetings and handling letters, while abandoning or relaxing their grasp and leadership of the main work, and not paying attention to the training and education of cadres. (3) The work styles of bureaucracy, procrastination, and carelessness are prevalent in various organs and departments.

After summarizing and inspecting work and personal self-criticism, the policy and ideological level and work enthusiasm of the cadres of provincial-level organs and departments have generally improved. Currently, they are implementing the spirit of rectification and vigorously improving work. Ma Guorui, Deputy Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave an enlightening report to the cadres of the provincial organs on September 6 on how to improve future work and consolidate the achievements of rectification. The Provincial Direct Organs Study Committee General Assembly issued "Instructions on How the Provincial Direct Organs Should Improve Future Work in the Rectification Movement" to various units on the second day. The Provincial Party Committee issued "Instructions on Deepening Rectification Leadership and Consolidating Rectification Achievements" on September 29. These reports and instructions pointed out that various units must implement the mass line in improving their work, and focus on solving major problems based on the actual situation. According to the spirit of the instructions, the provincial direct organs, in light of the specific circumstances of their units, have proposed ways to improve work through discussions from the bottom up and from the top down.

First, various departments have formulated various systems and detailed rules for work. Such as systems for summarizing and inspecting work, systems for requesting instructions and reporting, systems for learning and office work, the scope of work of various departments, and the responsibilities of cadres. Various departments also studied and discussed the original systems, insisting on continuing with the good ones, revising and supplementing the ones with shortcomings or incompleteness, and canceling the unnecessary ones and simplifying the complex ones. Some organs have also established a cadre reward and punishment system.

Second, strengthen the study of policies and theories, strengthen the leadership of cadres' policy ideology, and improve the policy and ideological level of cadres. After inspecting the work, all organs paid great attention to this issue, and some departments have stipulated learning methods. For example, the Provincial People's Court stipulates that two evenings a week should be set aside for policy study. The Provincial People's Government proposed that responsible comrades should establish a regular study and discussion system, and at the same time, leading comrades must personally lead the study to solve the problems existing in the work and thinking of cadres through study. The Provincial Finance Department stipulated that experts will be regularly organized to report on policy issues in the future, so as to effectively improve the policy thinking of cadres.

Third, establish a strict inspection system: After the work plan and instructions of each agency are issued, the degree and results of implementation are regularly inspected and summarized. This is an effective way to prevent and correct bureaucratic and careless work styles. The Provincial People's Court has established an inspection system for judgments and official documents to ensure that there is not a single mistake. Some organs stipulate that the desks should be cleaned up every day to prevent the recurrence of the phenomenon of accumulating letters and problems from lower levels.

Fourth, strengthen the party's organizational life and continue to carry out criticism and self-criticism. This is one of the important ways to improve work and consolidate the results of the rectification. The Communist Party branches of all organs have paid attention to the issue of strictly enforcing the organizational life of party members. It is stipulated that the organizational life should focus on the problems that have been checked out in the rectification, and through the supervision of the organizational life, help cadres correct mistakes and improve work. Make the weapon of criticism and self-criticism a daily habit of every party member cadre, so as to further unite the entire party.

After the rectification, some cadres in individual departments have the phenomenon of breathing a sigh of relief. Various organs have paid attention to preventing the growth of such complacency and laxity.

### 加强学习严格党的生活健全制度经常检查总结  河北省直属机关巩固整风成果

　　加强学习严格党的生活健全制度经常检查总结
    河北省直属机关巩固整风成果
    【本报讯】记者朱波报道：河北省直属各机关整风运动，基本上已告结束。现各机关已转入改进工作、巩固整风成果的阶段。
    在此次整风中发现河北省直属机关工作中的主要问题是：（一）在执行政策方面，从总的领导上来看是正确的。但有些机关，在执行政策中也发生了一些偏差。如：教育厅对工农教育政策重视不够，省供销社对“群众办社”、“民主管理”的思想不够明确，省税务局对税务工作政策不够明确，省人民法院在执行“镇压反革命分子”政策上有些偏差等。因此使工作遭受了不小的损失。（二）工作中的官僚主义作风：各机关、部门的领导方法上普遍存在着工作布置多，而且有的不切合实际，具体帮助、检查少的缺点。有些领导同志终日忙于开会、批办信件，而放弃或放松了对主要工作的掌握与领导，不注意干部的培养教育。（三）各机关、部门较普遍的存在着文牍主义、拖拉迟缓及粗枝大叶的工作作风。
    省级各机关部门干部，经过总结检查工作及个人检查总结以后，政策思想水平和工作积极性一般均有所提高。目前正贯彻整风精神，大力改进工作。中共河北省委副书记马国瑞曾于九月六日就如何改进今后工作，巩固整风成果问题，向省直机关干部作了启发报告。省直学委总会于第二日向各单位发出“省直各机关在整风运动中如何改进今后工作的指示”，省委又在九月二十九日发出“关于深入整风领导巩固整风成果的指示”。这些报告和指示指出，各单位在改进工作中必须贯彻群众路线，根据实际情况，抓住主要问题进行改进。省直各机关根据指示精神，联系本单位的具体情况，经过从下而上与自上而下的讨论，提出改进工作办法。
    第一，各部门制定了各种制度和工作细则。如总结、检查工作制度，请示报告制度，学习、办公制度，各部门工作范围及干部职责等。各部门并对原有制度进行了研究讨论，好的坚持下去，有缺点或不完整的进行修正补充，不必要的取消，复杂的简化。有的机关还建立了干部奖惩制度。
    第二，加强政策、理论的学习，加强对干部的政策思想的领导，提高干部政策思想水平。检查工作后，各机关对此问题都非常注意，有些部门已规定了学习办法。如省人民法院规定每星期要抽出两个晚上的时间进行政策学习。省人民政府提出负责同志要建立定期的学习讨论制，同时领导同志一定要亲身领导学习，通过学习解决干部工作上、思想上存在的问题。省府财政厅规定今后定期组织专人报告政策问题，以便有效的提高干部的政策思想。
    第三，建立严格的检查制度：各机关工作计划、指示下达后，定期检查与总结执行的程度和结果。这是防止和纠正官僚主义粗枝大叶作风的有效办法。省人民法院建立了对判决书、公文的检查制度，做到不错一字，有的机关规定每天清理办公桌，防止继续发生积压下级信件，问题现象。
    第四，加强党的组织生活，继续展开批评与自我批评，这是改进工作巩固整风成果的重要办法之一。各机关中共支部都注意了严格党员组织生活的问题。并规定组织生活应以整风中所检查出来的问题为主要问题，通过组织生活的监督，帮助干部改正错误，提高工作。使批评与自我批评的武器成为每个党员干部的日常生活习惯，以便使全党进一步的团结。
    整风后，个别部门干部思想上有松一口气的现象。各机关已注意防止此种自满与松懈情绪的滋长。
