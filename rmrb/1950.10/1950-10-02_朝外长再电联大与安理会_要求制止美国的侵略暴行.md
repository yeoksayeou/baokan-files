Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 30th. Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Park Heon-yeong, sent a telegram to the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Andiyan, and the President of the Security Council, Jebb, on the 28th, once again accusing the US imperialism of armed intervention in Korea under the banner of the United Nations, demanding that the United Nations take prompt measures to stop the aggressive atrocities of US imperialism, and make all foreign armed interventionist troops immediately withdraw from Korea.
    In the telegram, Park Heon-yeong cited the secret documents of the Syngman Rhee puppet government seized by the Korean People's Army, proving with irrefutable ironclad facts that the Syngman Rhee gang had prepared plans to invade North Korea a long time ago with the consent of the US government and even senior UN officials. Park Heon-yeong emphasized that, according to the United Nations Charter, the United Nations shall not directly interfere in the internal affairs of any country. Domestic disputes are not within the jurisdiction of the Security Council. Every nation has the right to resolve its own affairs according to its own will. The armed intervention of US imperialism in the internal affairs of Korea is a complete violation of the United Nations Charter. Park Heon-yeong finally pointed out that the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had notified the Security Council of the various atrocities of the US interventionists in Korea in its statements on August 5 and September 7 this year, but the pro-American majority in the Security Council ignored the protests of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, obstructing the adoption of measures to stop the atrocities of US imperialism. Now, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea once again protests against the intervention of foreign armed forces in Korea, demands that the United Nations take prompt measures to immediately stop the intervention, and withdraw the aggressor troops from Korea; and requests that the contents of this statement be notified to all member states of the United Nations, and that the measures adopted by the United Nations on this issue be informed.

　　朝外长再电联大与安理会
    要求制止美国的侵略暴行
    【新华社平壤三十日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永，二十八日致电联合国大会主席安迪让与安理会主席杰伯，再度控诉美帝国主义在联合国招牌下对朝鲜的武装干涉，要求联合国迅速采取措施，制止美帝国主义的侵略暴行，使一切外国武装干涉者的军队立即撤出朝鲜。
    朴宪永在电文中引述了朝鲜人民军所缴获的李承晚傀儡政府的秘密文件，以无可辩驳的铁的事实，证明李承晚匪帮从很早以前就在美国政府以至联合国高级官员的同意之下，准备好了侵犯北朝鲜的计划。朴宪永强调指出：根据联合国宪章，联合国不得直接干涉任何国家的内政。国内的纷争，不属于安理会的管辖范围。每个民族具有根据自己意志解决自己事务的权利。美帝国主义对朝鲜内政的武装干涉，完全违反了联合国宪章。朴宪永最后指出：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府曾在今年八月五日和九月七日的声明中，将美国干涉者在朝鲜的种种暴行事实通知安理会，但安理会中的亲美多数派，竟无视朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的抗议，妨碍了采取制止美帝国主义暴行的办法。现在，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府再一次抗议外国武装力量对朝鲜的干涉，要求联合国迅速采取措施，立即制止干涉行为，使侵略者的军队撤出朝鲜；并要求将此项声明内容通知联合国全体会员国，并将联合国就此项问题所通过的办法见告。
