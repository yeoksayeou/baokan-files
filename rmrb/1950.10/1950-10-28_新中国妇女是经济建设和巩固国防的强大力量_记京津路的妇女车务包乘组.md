New China's Women are a Powerful Force in Economic Construction and National Defense Consolidation
    ——On the Women's Train Service Group of the Beijing-Tianjin Railway

　　One morning around nine o'clock, at Platform No. 1 of Beijing East Railway Station, a brand-new train with a light yellow body and green stripes was quietly receiving passengers heading to Tianjin. This was the reserved-seat express train on the Beijing-Tianjin line. Beside each carriage door of this train stood female train attendants, female public security officers, and female service personnel! They were all dressed in neat uniforms, full of energy. They were helping passengers board the train in a friendly manner. One female train attendant was checking the ticket of a passenger dressed as a farmer, telling him which carriage to board. Another was reaching out to take a child from the arms of a female passenger carrying luggage onto the train. Two others were helping an old lady board the train. The old lady was gratefully muttering, "You are even better than my own daughters. If it weren't for you, this old woman would have had trouble getting on and off the train. People get old, but the railway has become so much better!"

　　At half-past nine, the female train conductor displayed the departure signal at the end of the train. This group of female train attendants, female public security officers, and female service personnel all boarded the train and closed the doors. The train started moving. In each carriage, they began to busy themselves again. The female train attendants in blue uniforms opened the newspaper and magazine box for passengers to borrow. Then they picked up brooms and swept up the scraps of paper and cigarette butts that passengers had thrown on the floor after boarding. The female service personnel in white uniforms were carrying teapots, pouring tea for the passengers, or walking back and forth in the carriages selling snacks and candies. The female public security officers in yellow uniforms began patrolling inside the train. The loudspeaker also started broadcasting. "Each carriage has a newspaper and magazine box..." "Please help keep the train clean..." The female train conductor, holding a ticket clip, was checking the passengers' tickets carriage by carriage... They skillfully handled various tasks on the train, making passengers feel that they were in no way inferior to the male attendants they were used to seeing, and in some cases, even more attentive.

　　This women's train service group consists of thirty female staff members, with twenty of them taking turns to work on the train each day. Like other male service groups, they include passenger train conductors, operations train conductors, train attendants, public security officers, baggage handlers, and service personnel. Although they have been on the job for less than seven months, they have already achieved excellent results. For example, once, when the train was approaching Beicang, it was stopped on a bridge for three hours due to a locomotive failure. It is rare for passenger trains to encounter such a long delay, and it is also very troublesome, especially since they do not have much work experience yet. However, they calmly explained the cause of the accident and the rescue measures to the passengers, and continuously reported the progress of the rescue to the passengers. They also took out the chess and playing cards they had bought themselves for the passengers to play, and organized cultural and recreational activities in the carriages. In this way, they maintained order on the train at all times.

　　On the train they serve, the phenomena of overcrowding and uncleanliness have been eliminated. Passengers sitting on the train, looking out the window at the rapidly receding lush green fields, truly felt the joy of traveling and had unlimited hope for the future of passenger transport in New China.

　　Their work achievements are reflected not only in the rewards from the Railway Bureau but also in the praise from passengers. In the opinion books in each carriage, passengers have written countless words of encouragement and praise for them.

　　"Women's Train Service Group" has become an honorary title, publicized among passengers and spread among railway workers alongside the "March 8th" locomotive Tian Guiying's crew in Dalian. Their achievements once again provide powerful proof of the possibility of women in New China widely participating in economic construction.

　　新中国妇女是经济建设和巩固国防的强大力量
    ——记京津路的妇女车务包乘组
    一天早晨九点钟左右，北京东车站的一号站台上有一列浅黄色带绿条纹的崭新的列车，正在安静地接待着到天津去的旅客。这是京津路上的对号快车。在这列车的每节车门旁边站着的列车员、公安员和服务员都是妇女！她们穿着整齐的制服，一个个精神饱满。她们在和蔼地帮助旅客们上车，一个女列车员正在看着一个穿农民服装的旅客的票，告诉他应该上那一节车。一个正跨过去从一个提着行李上车的女客人怀里把她的小孩抱了过来。另外两个正在扶着一个老太太上车，老太太唠唠叨叨在感激着：“你们真比咱亲闺女还好，要不是你们，咱老婆子上下车可够瞧了。人变老啦，铁路可变好啦！”
    九点半，女运转列车长在车尾显示了开车的信号，这一群女列车员、女公安员、女服务员就都上了车，关好了车门。列车开动了。在每一节车厢里，她们又开始忙碌起来。穿着蓝制服的女列车员把供给旅客借阅的书报箱打开，然后拿起扫帚，扫着旅客们上车以后投在地上的纸片、烟头。穿着白制服的女服务员，有的提着茶壶，给旅客倒着茶水，有的来回在车厢里卖着点心和糖果。穿着黄制服的女公安员在车内开始巡逻。播音器也响起来了。“每节车有书报箱……。”“车上的卫生请大家来保持……。”女列车长拿着票夹子，一节一节车地验着旅客的票……。她们熟练地处理着列车上的各种工作，使旅客们感到把她们比之于平常所看惯了的男乘务员是丝毫也不逊色的，有的比男乘务员工作更细心。
    她们这一个妇女车务包乘组，一共是三十个女工作人员，每天由二十个人轮流上车工作。和其他的男乘务组一样，她们之中包括客运列车长、运转列车长、列车员、公安员、行李员和服务员。虽然她们上车还不到七个月，但是她们已经创造了优良的成绩。譬如有一次列车快到北仓的时候，因机车发生故障，在桥上停了三个钟头。客车遇到这样长时间的故障是稀有的，同时也是很麻烦的事，尤其是她们工作经验还不多。可是她们从容不迫地向旅客们说明发生事故的原因和救援的办法，并连续向旅客报告救援进展的情形。她们还拿出自己买的象棋、扑克给旅客玩，组织旅客们在车厢里进行文化娱乐活动。就这样，她们使车上的秩序始终井然未乱。
    在她们包乘的这列车上，拥挤和不清洁的现象已经消灭了。旅客坐在车上，了望窗外飞快后退的葱翠原野，真正感到了旅行的愉快，并对未来新中国的客运事业感到了无限美好的希望。
    她们工作的成绩，除了从路局的奖励中看到外，从旅客的表扬中反映出来。在每节车的意见簿上旅客们都写下了无数鼓励和表扬她们的话。
    “妇女车务包乘组”已成为一个荣誉的称号，和大连“三八号”机车田桂英包乘组，同时在旅客中被宣扬着，在铁道职工中传播着。她们的成绩再一次地为新中国妇女广泛参加经济建设事业的可能性，提供了有力的证明。    【新华社】
