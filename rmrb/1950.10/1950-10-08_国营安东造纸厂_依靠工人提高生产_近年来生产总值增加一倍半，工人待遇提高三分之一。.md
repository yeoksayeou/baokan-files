　　State-owned Andong Paper Mill
    Relies on Workers to Increase Production
    Total Output Value Has Increased by 150% in Recent Years, and Workers' Benefits Have Increased by One-Third.
    [Report from this newspaper, Andong] In the past year, the state-owned Andong Paper Mill has achieved unprecedented development and growth in production. In the ten months from November of last year to August of this year, the factory's total output value increased by 168.9% compared to January to October of last year, the production quantity increased by 154.8%, and the production efficiency was greatly improved. In August of this year, the production value per person increased by 48.43% compared to August of last year. First-class products increased by 9.85%, second-class products decreased by 11.3%; costs followed suit, dropping by 92.3 billion yuan (Northeast currency, same below) from January to August alone, accounting for 9.45% of the total cost.
    The main reason for the factory's achievements is the development of the New Record Movement.
    Before October of last year, the factory faced numerous difficulties in production, the most important of which was the shortage of raw materials (pulp), which severely restricted production. The factory management committee seized this key issue and called on workers to shorten the cooking time of the wood vats (large pots for steaming pulp) as the direction for breaking new records at that time. After painstaking research by Nie Zhongyi, a worker in the wood vat workshop, a new record was finally created on November 3rd, shortening the cooking time from 18.30 hours to 12.30 hours, ensuring the supply of raw materials for the entire factory and promoting the creation of new records by papermaking workers. As the output increased, the chemical solution (sulfurous acid liquid) was insufficient, so the roasting furnace (manufacturing sulfurous acid liquid) workers concentrated their wisdom and timely transformed the gas baffle, changing the iron pipe to a lead pipe to avoid gas erosion, and changed the seven-horsepower windmill on the medicine tower to twenty horsepower, thus creating a new record for sulfurous acid liquid, increasing the daily output from 144 cubic meters to 161 cubic meters; afterwards, the factory management committee accepted the rationalization proposal of worker Wang Dufa to dry mineral powder to reduce moisture, thus producing more medicine, which enabled the daily output of medicine to increase to 194 cubic meters. From November of last year to August of this year, a total of 1,354 advanced producers created 77 new records, creating a value of more than 34.7 billion yuan.
    After the New Record Movement was launched throughout the factory, new and reasonable quotas continued to emerge, effectively improving production. By late December of last year, relatively reasonable quota figures were found, correcting the initial quota figures that only analyzed the potential of the machine and neglected the creativity of labor. In order to consolidate the existing achievements, various contracts (collective, liaison, master-apprentice, mutual aid) were also signed, and a relatively clear understanding of the mechanical efficiency and its degree of use was gradually achieved. Since January of this year, based on the combination of political mobilization and material rewards, the New Record Movement has been further developed, and the quota figures have gradually increased. By August of this year, the factory's eleven papermaking machines had created a total of 26 new records, continuously rising from the daily output of 7.5 tons of B-grade office paper to a new record of 13 tons and 324 kilograms. The quota figures have been raised four times accordingly, from 7.5 tons to 11.2 tons.
    Due to the continuous emergence of new records, all cadres were educated to recognize the great power of the workers, break the shackles of the "Manchukuo standards" ideology, and establish the idea of relying on the working class to improve the management system. In terms of organizational structure and management system, the system of single responsibility and regional responsibility was implemented, a production responsibility system was established; security inspections and re-inspections were carried out in spring and autumn; the eight-grade wage system was changed, an independent accounting system was implemented, and financial management was initially implemented; from September of this year, piece-rate wages were also tried out.
    With the development of production, the lives of the workers have also been appropriately improved. Wage benefits have been improved. Last year, the average monthly salary of papermaking workers was 101.33 work points per person, and this year the average salary per person was 127.96 work points, plus the excess reward, which is generally 33.47% higher than last year. The workers' welfare has also increased compared to the past. From January to August, expenditures on welfare, medical expenses, cultural and educational expenses, and labor insurance welfare totaled more than 2.4 billion yuan. In addition, doctors and nurses were added to the health clinic, barbershops were added, and bathhouses were expanded. The cultural level of the workers has also improved with the development of production and the strengthening of cultural life. According to incomplete statistics, before last year, employees with a cultural level of primary school or above accounted for 55.95%, while this year it has reached 65%, and those who are literate or illiterate have decreased by 7.2% this year compared to last year. Now, the workers of the entire factory are still working actively to develop the country's industrial production and improve their own lives.

### 国营安东造纸厂  依靠工人提高生产  近年来生产总值增加一倍半，工人待遇提高三分之一。

　　国营安东造纸厂
    依靠工人提高生产
    近年来生产总值增加一倍半，工人待遇提高三分之一。
    【本报安东讯】近一年来，国营安东造纸厂在生产上获得了空前的发展与壮大。从去年十一月到今年八月的十个月中，该厂生产总值较去年一月到十月增加百分之一百六十八点九，生产数量增加百分之一百五十四点八，生产效率大为提高。今年八月每人生产价值较去年八月提高百分之四八点四三。一等产品增加了百分之九点八五，二等产品减少了百分之十一点三；成本跟着降低了，仅今年一月到八月，即降低成本九百二十三亿元（东北币，下同），占总成本百分之九点四五。
    该厂获得这些成绩的主要原因是开展了新纪录运动。
    在去年十月以前，该厂生产困难重重，其中最重要的是原料（纸浆）不足，严重地限制了生产。工厂管理委员会抓住了这一关键，号召工人缩短木釜（蒸煮纸浆的大锅）蒸煮时间，作为当时创新纪录的方向。经木釜车间工人聂忠义苦心研究，终于十一月三日创造了由十八点三十分的蒸煮时间，缩短到十二点三十分的新纪录，保证了全厂原料供给，推动抄纸工人创造了新纪录。产量提高了，药水（亚硫酸液）又感不足，焙烧炉（制造亚硫酸液）工友便集中智慧，及时改造了瓦斯挡板，把铁管改成铅管，免去瓦斯的侵蚀，又把药塔上七马力的风车改为二十马力，因而创造了亚硫酸液由日产一百四十四立方米提高到一百六十一立方米的新纪录；此后工厂管理委员会又接受了工人王度发干燥矿粉，降低水分，从而多出药水的合理化建议，使药水日产量提高到一百九十四立方米。从去年十一月到今年八月，共有一千三百五十四名先进生产者创造了七十七件新纪录，创造价值达三百四十七亿余元。
    新纪录运动在全厂范围内开展后，不断出现新的合理的定额，有效的提高了生产。到去年十二月下旬，找到了比较合理的定额数字，修正了过去只分析机器潜在能力，忽视劳动创造力的初期定额数字。为了巩固已有的成绩，又订立了各种合同（集体、联系、师徒、互助），对机械效能及其运用程度，逐渐有了比较明确的了解。自本年一月开始，在政治鼓动与物质奖励结合的基础上，新纪录运动更进一步得到发展，定额数字也逐步提高。该厂十一台抄纸机，到今年八月为止，共创二十六次新纪录，从日产乙办公纸七吨半定额连续上升到十三吨又三百二十四公斤的新纪录。定额数字随之提高了四次，由七吨半逐步提高到十一吨二百公斤。
    由于新纪录的不断出现，教育全体干部认识了工人的伟大力量，打破了“伪满标准”的思想束缚，从而树立了依靠工人阶级，改善管理制度的思想。在组织机构和管理制度上，实行了单一负责制与区域负责制，建立了生产责任制；进行了春秋两季的保安检查与复查；改变了八级工资制，执行了独立会计制度，初步执行了财务管理；从今年九月份开始，又试行了计件工资。
    随着生产的发展，工人生活也得到适当的改善。工资待遇提高了。抄纸工人去年每人每月平均工资为一○一点三三工分，今年每人平均工资为一二七点九六工分，再加上超额奖励，一般较去年提高百分之三三点四七。工人的福利上也较过去增多了，从一月到八月，福利费、医药费、文化教育费、劳保福利费等开支，共达二十四亿余元，另外增加了卫生所的医生护士，增加了理发所，扩充了浴池等。工人的文化水平也随着生产的发展与文化生活的加强而提高了，据不完全的统计，去年以前该厂初小以上文化程度的职工占百分之五十五点九五，而今年则达百分之六十五，粗通文字者及文盲，今年已较去年减少了百分之七点二。现在全厂的工人仍为着发展国家的工业生产和改善自己的生活而继续积极努力的工作着。
