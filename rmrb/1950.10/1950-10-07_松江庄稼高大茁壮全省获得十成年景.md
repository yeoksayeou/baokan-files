[Shenyang News] *Northeast Daily* reports: Farmers in Songjiang Province began harvesting their bountiful 2.05 million hectares of grain crops in early September. In Linkou County, where harvesting began earliest, incomplete statistics from various districts from September 4th to 9th show that 719.8 hectares had been harvested. In Ning'an County, the sorghum harvest is complete, and three-quarters of the corn in District 4 has been husked.

Except for some areas that experienced reduced yields due to a slight drought after the second period of intense summer heat ("er fu", usually late July), the overall harvest in Songjiang Province is expected to reach ten-tenths. With an average yield of 2,680 *jin* per hectare, the province is estimated to harvest over 3.2 million tons of grain. This represents a near doubling of grain production compared to last year. The province is expected to fulfill and surpass its grain production target of 531,028,000 *jin* this year. For example, Shangzhi County has a cultivated area of 71,000 hectares and, with a nine-tenths harvest, is expected to yield as much as 89,500 tons. Another example is Ning'an County, which experienced a drought with no rain for over 40 days after the second period of intense summer heat. Although the crops suffered and only yielded seven-tenths of a harvest, this is still a 30% increase compared to last year's four-tenths harvest. This is an unprecedented bountiful harvest for Songjiang Province in the past decade.

This year, due to the bountiful harvest, the crops have grown tall and sturdy, making them difficult to harvest. Additionally, due to the plumpness of the grains, they are easily detached from the cobs. Therefore, the provincial government has issued two directives on autumn harvesting, instructing all localities to center all work around the autumn harvest. It also called on farmers to harvest in a timely manner, to cut, pull, thresh and not to waste. Various counties have convened joint meetings of district Party secretaries and district heads, and most districts and villages have convened people's representative meetings to specifically arrange this work. During the preparations for the autumn harvest, local cooperatives, enterprise companies, and department stores have ensured the supply of autumn harvest tools such as carts, wooden shovels, and sacks to farmers. Shuangcheng County alone purchased 272 new carts and repaired 623 old carts. All localities have generally increased the number of corn storage buildings and granaries. According to statistics from Xubao District in Hulan, more than 1,860 new granaries and 260 corn storage buildings have been built in the district.

Based on the characteristics of this year's crops being difficult to harvest and maturing all at once, the counties have also reorganized labor mutual aid teams. They have mobilized men, women, old and young to participate in the autumn harvest work with all their strength. It is estimated that the autumn harvest in the province will be fully completed in late October.

　　松江庄稼高大茁壮全省获得十成年景
    【沈阳讯】东北日报消息：松江省农民，先后于九月上旬开始收割丰收的二百零五万垧粮谷作物。开镰最早的林口县，从九月四日到九日，据各区不完全统计：已割完七百十九垧八亩，宁安县高粱已割完，四区的苞米也扒完了四分之三。
    松江省大田除部分地区因二伏后稍旱而减产，全省年景仍可达到十成。每垧平均以二千六百八十市斤计算，全省估计可收三百二十余万吨粮食。全省比去年增产粮食近一倍；今年五十三万一千零二十八万市斤的粮食生产任务可望完成并超过。以尚志县为例，该县耕地面积共七万一千垧，年景以九成估计即收八万九千五百吨之多。又如二伏后四十余日无雨的宁安县，庄稼虽受旱，只有七成年景，但亦比去年四成年景增产三成。这是松江省十数年来所未有的丰收现象。
    今年由于丰收，庄稼长得高大茁壮，不易收割；同时因籽粒饱满，口松容易脱粒。为此，省府曾两次发布秋收工作指示，指示各地一切工作均围绕秋收进行。并号召农民及时收割，细割、细拉、细打以及糟蹋。各县均召开了区委书记、区长联席会，绝大部分区村召开了人民代表会，专门布置这一工作。在准备秋收期间，各地合作社、企业公司、百货公司保证供给了农民大车、木锨、麻袋等秋收工具。仅双城县就买进了二百七十二台新车，修理了六百二十三台旧车。各地都普遍增加苞米楼子和粮仓。据呼兰许堡区统计，全区新建起一千八百六十多个粮仓，二百六十个苞米楼子。
    各县又根据今年庄稼不好割，一齐成熟的特点，都又整顿了劳动互助组。并动员男女老幼齐下手，全力投入秋收工作。该省秋收估计可于十月下旬全部完成。
