Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The flames of guerrilla warfare waged by the Korean people against the American aggressors are burning on the vast land stretching from Wonsan in the north to Mokpo in the south. According to a United Press dispatch from Tokyo, MacArthur's spokesman admitted at a press conference on the 27th: "29,000 North Korean soldiers are now operating behind the 'United Nations' line in many groups, the largest of which numbers as many as 5,000." He also revealed that the largest unit of the Korean People's Guerrilla Force is disrupting American lines of communication and supplies 15 miles south of Wonsan. Another guerrilla unit of 1,500 men attacked Ichon, 35 miles north of the 38th parallel in central Korea, on the 25th, and captured a large number of 105mm shells. An Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 27th quoted a US military press officer in Tokyo as announcing that a large number of guerrilla forces, estimated at around 10,000, had also been discovered near Mokpo on the southwest coast of Korea. Another Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the same day quoted a spokesman for the US 10th Corps, indicating that the American aggressors were already fearful of the immense scale of the Korean people's guerrilla warfare. The spokesman said: "There are many North Koreans left behind us. They often come out of the mountains, attack coastal villages, intercept trains, and often harass us." The spokesman admitted that the Syngman Rhee puppet troops are "constantly attacked by communist snipers while passing through snow-covered mountainous areas."
