　　Introducing "New Construction" Volume 3, Issue 1
    "New Construction" Volume 3, Issue 1 was published on October 1st. This is the first issue after the journal was changed to an academic monthly. In the "Inaugural Message," the journal pointed out that its basic task in the future is to "popularize and improve the people's academic level." In order to achieve this task, the journal called on academic workers across the country to strengthen contact and unity. It also advocated that academic workers across the country should "establish and expand the united front of the academic community on the basis of a politically united front, and guided by the scientific truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought." The journal especially stated: "We are willing to dedicate all our pages to academic workers across the country who pursue truth and obey truth." It also hopes that colleagues in the academic community across the country will regard the journal as their own garden and work together for the construction of a new democratic culture.
    The contents of this issue: First, a special issue commemorating the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, including: Fan Wenlan: "Commemorating the Centenary of the Jintian Uprising," Liu Guiwu: "The People's Armed Organization of a Century Ago - The Taiping Army," and Wang Zhong: "How the Revolutionary People of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Dealt with Foreign Aggressors." Today, when the people's liberation war has achieved a comprehensive victory, it is of great significance to commemorate the pioneers of the people's revolution - the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. The second is monographs, including: Ai Siqi: "On Several Philosophical Issues," Wang Xuewen: "The Purpose and Method of Studying Political Economy," Fan Hong: "Marx's Theory of Periodic Panic," and Shen Zhiyuan: "The Impoverishment of the Working People in Capitalist Countries," etc. The nature of the articles includes philosophy, history, economics, politics and law.
