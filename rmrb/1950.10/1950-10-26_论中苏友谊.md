　　On Sino-Soviet Friendship
    A·Bǐlièwěi'ěrtài Luò
    Sino-Soviet friendship emerged with the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia. The establishment of the world's first socialist country of workers, which opposes all predatory imperialist interests, laid the foundation for a completely new type of international relations.
    In the "Declaration of Rights of the Exploited and Laboring People," adopted by the Soviet government in January 1918, it was declared that "...a complete break with the barbaric policy of bourgeois civilization, which is based on enslaving hundreds of millions of working people in Asia and colonies in general, as well as small countries, to create the welfare of exploiters among a few select nations" (Chinese edition of "Selected Works of Lenin," Vol. II, p. 315).
    The new socialist principles of foreign policy established by the great leaders of mankind, Lenin and Stalin, aroused the frantic hatred of the imperialist camp. The imperialists desperately tried to eliminate the center of socialist thought—the Soviet Union. Therefore, the struggle against international imperialism became the common task of Soviet Russia and the peoples of all colonies and dependent countries.
    Therefore, there is no one more resolute and thorough in protecting the freedom and independence of the peoples of colonies and dependent countries than the Soviet Union. Stalin, the leader of the Soviet people, said: "We assist nations that are victims of aggression and are fighting for their independence." (Chinese edition of "Problems of Leninism," p. 750).
    The great principles of Lenin and Stalin's Soviet foreign policy are vividly embodied in Sino-Soviet friendship. In the thirty-odd years since the October Socialist Revolution, the friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union has demonstrated great achievements for the Chinese people and all of mankind. Sino-Soviet friendship is the main pillar of the Chinese people's thirty years of liberation struggle. It played a decisive role in the victory of the Chinese people in defeating domestic reactionaries and foreign imperialism. The entire history of the Chinese people's liberation struggle affirms this indisputable conclusion like iron.
    British, American, and French imperialists dragged China into World War I; and in 1919, they sacrificed their ally China to obtain "compensation," seizing many territories that had been Chinese since ancient times (Shandong Province), and stipulating in the Treaty of Paris that these places be ceded to Japan. China's legitimate and legal demand—to abolish the privileges of foreigners stipulated in unequal treaties—was arrogantly and insultingly rejected by the imperialist powers, who considered it an absolutely impermissible extravagance on the part of China. The same thing happened at the Washington Conference in 1921-22. British, American, French, and Japanese imperialists took advantage of the victory over defeated Germany to redistribute "spheres of influence" and consolidate their rule in China. Such was the policy of imperialism.
    The imperialist policy of enslaving China was broken by the Soviet Union. In 1919, the Soviet government, in its declaration to the Chinese people, announced the abolition of the enslaving, unequal treaties concluded by the Tsarist government to oppress China. Due to the conspiracies of the imperialists, these new principles of Sino-Soviet relations were not realized until the formal Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1924. This was China's first equal treaty, and it dealt a fatal blow to the system of imperialist privileges in China. The Soviet government's declaration of 1919 and the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1924 broke through the imperialist front against the unity of China; they pointed out that the Chinese people had a strong friend and ally in Soviet Russia in their liberation struggle. This situation played a huge role in the Chinese people's liberation movement; it stimulated this movement and created new forces in the anti-imperialist struggle. It was precisely during the period of 1919-24 that the liberation and anti-imperialist movement unfolded in China like a storm.
    The people's movement, in which workers, peasants, progressive intellectuals, the national bourgeoisie, and people from all walks of life participated, quickly advanced to become the national liberation revolution of 1925-27. The imperialists responded with intervention. They aided their agents—the Chinese reactionary warlords—and ruthlessly suppressed the uprising of the people by force. This time, the Soviet people were still the leaders of the international support for the Chinese people fighting for their liberation. "Hands off China!"—this was the slogan put forward by the Soviets during the years of the Chinese people's heroic struggle against imperialism. At that time, the imperialists and Chinese reactionaries subjected the Chinese revolution to a temporary defeat. But the Chinese people never lost hope of achieving final victory. The historical example of the Soviet people, who had destroyed the forces of imperialism and domestic reactionaries in their own country, and the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, inspired the Chinese people's confidence in final victory.
    The decisive significance of Sino-Soviet friendship was particularly powerfully demonstrated in the years of the national liberation war against Japanese imperialism, which aimed to enslave China and turn it into its colony in 1937-45.
    The Soviet government resolutely protected China from Japanese aggression. While the imperialist powers were pursuing a policy of encouraging Japanese aggression, the Soviet Union concluded a non-aggression treaty with China and provided spiritual and material assistance to China's war of resistance against Japan.
    The Soviet Union's defeat of German fascism in the Great Patriotic War created the main prerequisite for China's liberation from the oppression of Japanese bandits. In August and September 1945, the Soviet armed forces dealt a fatal blow to the Japanese army in Northeast China, forcing it to surrender. In this way, the Soviet Union spared the Chinese people from colonial enslavement by Japanese imperialism and opened up prospects for China to live freely and independently. The treaty and agreements signed between China and the Soviet Union in 1945 were based on the unchanging principles of Soviet foreign policy: friendly relations, equal economic cooperation, non-interference in internal affairs, and protection of national independence from aggressors.
    Loyal to these principles, the Soviet government waged an unyielding struggle against the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialists in China after World War II. The Soviet government, in solidarity with the will of the Chinese people, demanded an end to American interference in China's internal affairs, the withdrawal of American troops from China, and an end to aid to Chinese reactionaries; it demanded that American imperialists no longer force China to preserve a corrupt and reactionary system, and no longer hinder the Chinese people's aspirations to reform the national political system on democratic principles.
    The establishment of the People's Republic of China in October 1949 was a summary of the Chinese people's historic victory over the Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialism. A new people's country appeared in vast Asia. For the first time in history, hundreds of millions of Chinese people seized power in their own hands. The first country to recognize this new people's country was the Soviet Union. This guaranteed the consolidation of the People's Republic of China's international position. Soon, this new historic act of Sino-Soviet friendship was supplemented by the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and several other agreements in February 1950. Sino-Soviet friendship entered a new historical stage. An era of great and unbreakable friendship between the people of socialist countries and the Chinese people who have freed themselves from imperialist oppression began. This friendship is a powerful international force. Its purpose is to help the Chinese people consolidate their people's democratic state in the shortest possible time, lead them on the path of political, economic, and cultural prosperity, and transform the country from a backward to an advanced industrial power. Its purpose is to consolidate China as a pillar of international peace and security among nations, and as a fortress in the struggle against aggressors and warmongers. Four hundred and seventy-five million people have been united by the aspiration to transform their lives on democratic and independent principles, and inspired by the aspiration to strive for peace in close unity with the head of the world's democratic forces, the great and powerful force that imperialists and warmongers must respect—the Soviet Union. It is precisely for this reason that Molotov pointed out that the brotherly alliance between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China has transformed Sino-Soviet friendship into "an unparalleled, unprecedented, great, and powerful force in the history of mankind in consolidating the cause of world peace!"

　　论中苏友谊
    Ａ·彼列委尔泰洛
    随着俄罗斯伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利，而产生了中苏两国的友谊。世界上第一个劳动者的、敌视一切掠夺性的帝国主义利益的社会主义国家的成立，奠定了完全新型的国际关系。
    苏联政府在一九一八年一月通过的“被剥削劳动人民权利宣言”中，宣布“……与资产阶级文明世界的野蛮政策完全断绝关系，这种政策是以奴役亚洲和一般殖民地以及弱小国家中数万万劳动民众为基础，造成少数特殊民族中剥削者的福利”（中文本《列宁文选》第二卷三一五页）。
    人类伟大领袖列宁和斯大林规定的对外政策的新的社会主义原则，激起了帝国主义阵营疯狂的毒恨。帝国主义者拚命想消灭社会主义思想的中心——苏联。因此，进行反对国际帝国主义的斗争，也就成为了苏维埃俄罗斯和一切殖民地与附属国人民的总任务了。
    因此，殖民地和附属国的人民，没有比苏联更为坚决、更为彻底地保护他们自由和独立的人。苏联人民的领袖斯大林说：“我们援助遭受侵略而为本国独立奋斗的民族。”（中文本《列宁主义问题》七五○页）
    列宁斯大林的苏联对外政策的诸伟大原则，鲜明地体现在中苏友谊中。在十月社会主义革命后的三十余年中，中苏两大民族的友谊，对于中国人民以及全体人类，都显示出了伟大的成绩。中苏友谊是中国人民在三十年的解放斗争中的主要支柱。它在中国人民击溃国内反动派和外国帝国主义的胜利中，起了决定性的作用。整个中国人民的解放斗争史，铁一般地肯定了这无可争辩的结论。
    英美和法国帝国主义者们，把中国拖进了第一次世界大战；而在一九一九年又牺牲自己的盟友中国来取得“补偿”，强夺了许多自古以来就是中国的领土（山东省的），并以巴黎和约规定将这些地方割给日本。中国的正当的、合法的要求——废除不平等条约所规定的外国人的特权，却被帝国主义列强傲慢地、侮辱地拒绝了，认为这是绝不可容许的中国的奢求。一九二一—一二二年的华盛顿会议上，也发生了本质相同的事情。英、美、法、日帝国主义者，趁着战败德国的胜利，来重新瓜分“势力范围”并巩固自己在中国的统治权。帝国主义的政策是如此的。
    帝国主义奴役中国的政策被苏联打破了。一九一九年，苏维埃政府在对中国人民的宣言中，宣布废除沙皇政府压迫中国所缔结的奴役的、不平等的条约。由于帝国主义者的阴谋，直到一九二四年的正式的中苏条约，才实现了中苏关系的这些新原则。这是中国的第一个平等条约，它给了中国境内帝国主义特权体系一个致命的打击。一九一九年的苏维埃政府的宣言和一九二四年的中苏条约，冲破了反对中国的统一的帝国主义阵线；它们指出，中国人民在自己的解放斗争中，得到了苏维埃俄罗斯这样一个强大的朋友和同盟者。这一情形，在中国人民的解放运动中，曾起了巨大作用；它刺激了这运动，造成了反帝斗争中的新力量。正是在一九一九——二四年这一期间，在中国风暴般地展开了解放的、反帝的运动。
    有工农、进步知识分子、民族资产阶级、各种阶层的人民参加的人民运动，很快地就进而成为了一九二五——二七年的民族解放革命。帝国主义者们以干涉来回答它。他们援助自己的代理人——中国反动军阀，并以武力无情地镇压起义的人民群众，这一次，成为国际上支持为自己的解放而奋斗的中国人民的力量的首领的，仍旧是苏联人民。“不干涉中国！”——这就是在中国人民进行反对帝国主义的英勇斗争的年头中，苏联人提出的口号。那时，帝国主义者和中国反动派，使中国革命遭受了暂时的失败。但中国人民决没有丧失达到最后胜利的希望。曾经摧毁自己国内帝国主义力量和国内反动派的苏联人民的历史性的榜样，和中苏人民的牢不可破的友谊，鼓舞了中国人民对最后胜利的信心。
    在一九三七——四五年，在反对以奴役中国和变中国为自己殖民地为目的的日本帝国主义的民族解放战争的年头中，特别有力地显示出中苏友谊的决定性的意义。
    苏联政府曾坚决地保护中国不受日本侵略。当帝国主义列强进行鼓励日本侵略的政策的时候，苏联与中国缔结了互不侵犯条约，并给中国的抗日战争以精神和物质的援助。
    苏联在伟大卫国战争中击溃了德国法西斯主义，也就造成了使中国从日本强盗压迫下解放出来的主要前提。一九四五年八月至九月，苏联武装力量在中国东北给了日本军队以致命的打击，迫使它投降。这样，苏联也就使中国人民免掉受日本帝国主义的殖民奴役，为中国打开了自由独立地生存的远景。一九四五年中苏两国签定的条约和协定，是以友好关系、平等地在经济上合作、不干涉内政、保护国家的独立不受侵略者的侵害这些苏联对外政策的不变的原则为基础的。
    忠守这些原则的苏联政府，曾进行不屈的斗争来反对第二次世界大战后美帝国主义者在中国的侵略性的阴谋。苏联政府与中国人民意志一致地要求停止美国干涉中国内政，美军从中国撤退，停止援助中国反动派；要求美帝国主义者不再强使中国保存腐朽的反动制度，不再妨碍中国人民在民主的原则上改革国家政体的志向。
    一九四九年十月中华人民共和国的成立，就是中国人民击溃国民党反动派和美帝国主义的历史性的胜利的总结。在广大的亚洲出现了一个新的人民国家。中国数亿人民，在历史上破天荒第一次地将政权抓在自己手里。第一个承认这个新的人民国家的是苏联。这也就保证了中华人民共和国的巩固的国际地位。不久就又以一九五○年二月的缔结中苏友好同盟互助条约和几个其他的协定，来补充了中苏友谊的这一新的历史性的行为。中苏友谊进入了新的历史阶段。社会主义国家的人民和已摆脱帝国主义压迫的中国人民之间的、伟大的、牢不可破的友好的时代开始了。这一友谊是强大的国际力量。它的目的是帮助中国人民在最短期间巩固他们的人民民主国家，使他们走上政治、经济、文化繁荣的道路，把国家从落后的变成进步的工业强国。它的目的是要巩固作为国际和平与各民族间的安全的支柱、作为反对侵略者和战争贩子的斗争的堡垒的中国。四亿七千五百万人民，已被在民主和独立的原则上改造自己的生活的志向团结起来，被与全世界民主力量之首、帝国主义者和战争贩子不得不重视的伟大强盛的力量——苏联密切团结起来以为和平奋斗的志向鼓舞着。正因此莫洛托夫才指出，苏联与中华人民共和国之间的弟兄般的联盟，将中苏友谊变成了“在巩固全世界和平的事业中的无可匹敌的、人类史中也从未有过的、一种伟大的、强大的力量！”
