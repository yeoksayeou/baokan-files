Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 12th: State-owned grain companies in the Central-South region have been massively purchasing grain, stabilizing grain prices, and narrowing the scissors differential between industrial and agricultural products.

This year, the Central-South region has seen a general bumper harvest of crops, with a large increase in the amount of new grain entering the market compared to previous years. Grain prices had fallen below the normal seasonal differential. Some cadres of state-owned grain companies in Hunan and Guangdong provinces were concerned that the new grain had high moisture content and was difficult to store, and were reluctant to purchase freely, leading to a further decline in new grain prices. In the grain-producing areas of Guangxi and Hunan provinces, the lowest grain price was only 20,000 RMB per 100 jin, and the scissors differential between industrial and agricultural products was very large. After September, grain companies in various regions began to strengthen their purchasing work. For example, the average daily purchase volume of state-owned grain companies in cities such as Nanchang, Guangzhou, and Wuhan generally accounted for 50% to 75% of the total market transaction volume. The daily grain purchase volume of the Changsha state-owned grain company increased from 3% of the total market transaction volume to 40%. At the same time, state-owned grain companies vigorously organized private merchants to purchase, reversing the downward trend in grain prices and gradually pushing them back up. By the beginning of this month, grain prices across the region had generally stabilized. Currently, the market prices of grain in Changsha, Nanchang, Wuhan, and other places have exceeded the listed prices of state-owned companies. The market prices of grain in many small and medium-sized towns have also rebounded from 20% to 30% below the listed price to near the level of the listed price.

Along with the stabilization of grain prices, state-owned specialized companies have organized the supply of industrial products to the countryside, promoting active urban-rural exchange, and the scissors differential between industrial and agricultural products has gradually narrowed. At the end of August, in Changsha, one piece of 20-count cotton yarn could be exchanged for 11,121 jin of rice, one bolt of fine cloth for 462 jin of rice, and 100 jin of crude salt for 243 jin of rice. By September 28, the price ratio of 20-count yarn had narrowed to 9,357 jin of rice per piece, fine cloth to 367 jin of rice per bolt, and crude salt to 184 jin of rice per 100 jin.

To maintain the stability of grain prices, in addition to the continued purchasing by state-owned grain companies, the Central-South Financial and Economic Committee has decided to provide loans of 365 billion RMB through the Central-South Branch of the People's Bank of China, a portion of which will be lent to private merchants to support their large-scale transportation and sales of grain; another portion will be lent to farmers to prevent them from selling grain at low prices due to urgent production or living needs.

Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 13th: The Central-South Region State-Owned Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company Vigorously Purchases New Cotton.

According to estimates by the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Central-South Military and Political Committee, the total output of new cotton in the Central-South region this year will reach more than 3.57 million dan, an increase of one-third compared to last year. It is estimated that three-quarters of this will be sold by farmers. To stabilize cotton prices and ensure the supply of raw materials for the textile industry, the State-Owned Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company began purchasing in mid-August, when the new cotton first came onto the market, in production areas such as Lingbao, Shanzhou, and Wenxiang in Henan, Huanggang and Wuxue in Hubei, and Changde, Taoyuan, and Hanshou in Hunan. As new cotton entered the market in large quantities, the total purchase volume of cotton yarn and fabric companies across the Central-South region reached more than 61,600 dan in September, completing the original purchase plan.

The Central-South Region State-Owned Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company paid attention to leading and organizing private merchant purchasing and sales during the purchasing process. By the end of September, private cotton merchants in Hankou, Changsha, Zhengzhou, Shashi, and other places had established joint purchasing and sales organizations, giving play to the business enthusiasm of private merchants and reducing blind competition. In addition to direct purchasing, cotton yarn and fabric companies in various regions entrusted private merchants to purchase large quantities on their behalf.

While purchasing cotton, cotton yarn and fabric companies in various parts of the Central-South region, in cooperation with other state-owned specialized companies, organized the supply of a large number of essential goods to farmers. In September, cotton yarn and fabric companies across the region sold more than 261,980 bolts of cotton cloth and 1,788 pieces of cotton yarn. The Henan Provincial Grain Company sold more than 5 million jin of grain to cotton-producing areas such as Shanzhou and Lingbao in early September alone, and the Jiangxi Provincial Department Store also organized sales teams to go to the countryside. To improve the quality of cotton, the Central-South Region Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company trained a large number of cotton industry technicians to assist in the purchasing work before the purchasing began. At the same time, local industrial and commercial administrative departments also began to strengthen education for a small number of cotton merchants who were accustomed to counterfeiting.

Cotton prices in the Central-South region have generally stabilized after vigorous purchasing by cotton yarn and fabric companies; however, due to the low price of grain, cotton prices in various regions generally exceed the normal cotton-grain price ratio. Secondly, regional price differences urgently need to be adjusted. The Trade Department of the Central-South Military and Political Committee is currently making adjustments.

　　稳定粮棉价格缩小工农产品剪刀差
    中南区大量收购粮食棉花
    注意组织私商购销收到显著效果
    【新华社汉口十二日电】中南区国营粮食公司大量收购粮食，稳定了粮价，缩小了工、农业产品的剪刀差价。
    今年中南区农作物普告丰收，新粮上市量比往年大增，粮价曾下落到季节性正常差价以下。湖南、广东诸省国营粮食公司的部分干部又顾虑新谷水分大，不易保管，不敢放手收购，新粮价格因而更趋下跌。广西、湖南两省粮产区谷价最低时每百市斤只售人民币二万多元，工农产品的剪刀差价很大。九月以后，各地粮食公司开始加强收购工作，如南昌、广州、武汉等城市的国营粮食公司平均每日收购数量一般都占市场总成交量的百分之五十至七十五，长沙市国营粮食公司每日收购粮食由过去占市场总成交量的百分之三增加到百分之四十。同时，国营粮食公司又大力组织私商收购，扭转了粮价的跌势，并使其逐步回升。到本月初，全区粮价业已大体稳定。目前长沙、南昌、武汉等地的粮食市价都已超过国营公司的牌价；许多中小城镇的粮食市价也都从低于牌价百分之二十至三十回升到接近牌价的水平。
    与粮价稳定同时，各国营专业公司又组织了工业品下乡，城乡交流活跃，工农产品间的剪刀差价已渐趋短小。八月底如长沙市一件二十支棉纱换大米一万一千一百二十一斤，一匹细布换大米四百六十二斤，芦盐每百斤换大米二百四十三斤，到九月二十八日二十支纱的比价已缩小到每件换大米九千三百五十七斤，细布每匹换大米三百六十七斤，芦盐每百斤换大米一百八十四斤。
    为使粮价经常保持稳定，除国营粮食公司继续收购外，中南区财政经济委员会并决定由中国人民银行中南区行发放贷款三千六百五十亿元，其中一部贷给私商，扶助其大量运销粮食；另一部贷给农民，使其不致因生产或生活急需而贱价卖粮。
    【新华社汉口十三日电】中南区国营花纱布公司大力收购新棉。
    据中南区军政委员会农林部估计：今年中南区新棉总产量达三百五十七万余担，比去年增加三分之一。估计其中四分之三将被农民售出。国营花纱布公司为稳定棉价，保证纺织业的原料供应，自八月中旬新棉初上市起，即先后在河南灵宝、陕州、阌乡，湖北黄冈、武穴、及湖南常德、桃源、汉寿等产地，着手收购。随着新棉大量上市，中南全区各地花纱布公司九月份全月收购总数达到六万一千六百余担，完成了原订收购计划。
    中南区国营花纱布公司在收购中注意了领导和组织私商购销。截至九月底止，汉口、长沙、郑州、沙市等地的私营棉商，都已建立了联购联销组织，发挥了私商的经营积极性，并减少了盲目的竞争。各地花纱布公司除直接收购外，并委托私商大量代购。
    与购棉同时，中南各地花纱布公司配合其他国营专业公司组织了大量必需品供应农民。全区各地花纱布公司，九月份售出棉布二十六万一千九百八十余匹，棉纱一千七百八十八件。河南省粮食公司，仅九月上旬调往陕州、灵宝一带产棉区销售的粮食，即达五百多万斤，江西省百货公司并组织推销组下乡。为提高棉花品质，中南区花纱布公司在收购前曾训练了大批棉业技术人员协助收购工作，同时各地工商行政部门也开始加强了对少数习于作伪的棉商的教育。
    中南区棉价在花纱布公司大力收购后，大体稳定；但由于粮价太低，各地棉价一般都超过棉粮正常比价。其次，地区差价也急待调整。中南军政委员会贸易部现正进行调整中。
