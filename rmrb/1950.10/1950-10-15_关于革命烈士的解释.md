　　Explanation Regarding Revolutionary Martyrs
    Question: The Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China stipulates: the families of martyrs residing in rural areas should be allocated the same share of land and other means of production as farmers, and the martyr himself should be counted within the family population. Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi said in the "Report on the Land Reform Issue": The families of martyrs "should include the direct relatives of martyrs who died in action or died for the revolution in previous revolutions since the Xinhai Revolution and the direct relatives of the anti-Japanese war martyrs." The Decision of the Government Administration Council on Classifying Rural Class Components states: "The term revolutionary martyr's family refers to the father, mother, wife (or husband), son, daughter, and siblings under the age of sixteen of martyrs who died in action or died for the revolution in previous revolutions since the Xinhai Revolution, anti-Japanese war martyrs, and People's Liberation War martyrs." What should be the scope of martyrs?
    Answer from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government:
    Martyrs' families refer to the direct relatives of martyrs who indeed died in action or died for the revolution and the anti-Japanese war since the Xinhai Revolution; otherwise, they cannot be counted. Specifically speaking, the scope of martyrs should include: (1) Martyrs who sacrificed during the Xinhai Revolution for participating in the opposition to the Manchu Qing rule. Those who died in the warlord melee after the Xinhai Revolution are not included. (2) Martyrs who died in action from 1924 to 1927 for participating in the East Expedition and the Northern Expedition. Kuomintang officers and soldiers who died in the warlord melee and anti-communist war after Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei openly betrayed the revolution on April 12 and July 15, 1927, are not included. (3) Martyrs and officers and soldiers of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army who sacrificed from 1927 to 1937 for participating in the domestic revolutionary war and armed uprisings. (4) Officers and soldiers who sacrificed in the January 1932 Songhu Anti-Japanese War, the March 1933 Great Wall Anti-Japanese War, the summer 1933 Chahar Anti-Japanese War, the winter 1936 Suiyuan Anti-Japanese War, and officers and soldiers of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army and Anti-Japanese Allied Army who sacrificed. (5) Officers and soldiers of the Eighth Route Army, New Fourth Army, and other people's anti-Japanese troops who sacrificed from 1937 to 1945 for participating in the Anti-Japanese War. Kuomintang officers and soldiers (including the air force) who indeed died in action during the Anti-Japanese War are also included, but those who died during this period for participating in the anti-communist civil war are not included. (6) Commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army who sacrificed in the People's Liberation War. Former Kuomintang officers and soldiers who revolted and sacrificed for participating in the People's Liberation War are also included. (7) Martyrs who were killed by imperialists and domestic reactionaries for participating in various revolutionary struggles since the May Fourth Movement in 1919, and those who died of illness in prison for participating in revolutionary struggles are also included.

　　关于革命烈士的解释
    问：中华人民共和国土地改革法规定：家居乡村的烈士家属应分给与农民同样的一份土地和其他生产资料，烈士本人得计算在家庭人口之内。刘少奇副主席在《关于土地改革问题的报告》中说：烈士家属“应包括辛亥革命以来历次为革命阵亡和死难烈士的直系亲属及抗日阵亡将士的直系亲属在内”。政务院关于划分农村阶级成份的决定说：“凡称革命烈士家属，是指辛亥革命以来历次为革命阵亡和死难的烈士、抗日阵亡将士和人民解放战争中阵亡将士的父、母、妻（或夫）、子、女及十六岁以下的弟妹。”烈士的范围应该是怎样的呢？
    中央人民政府内务部答：
    烈士家属，是指辛亥革命以来确系为革命及抗日而阵亡和死难的烈士的直系亲属而言，否则即不能算。烈士的范围，具体地说来，应包括：（一）辛亥革命中因参加反对满清统治而牺牲的烈士。辛亥革命后在军阀混战中死亡者不在内。（二）一九二四年至一九二七年因参加东征和北伐战争而阵亡的烈士。一九二七年四月十二日及七月十五日蒋介石及汪精卫公开叛变革命后在军阀混战及反共战争中死亡的国民党军官兵不在内。（三）一九二七年至一九三七年因参加国内革命战争和武装起义而牺牲的烈士和工农红军官兵。（四）一九三二年一月淞沪抗日战役、一九三三年三月长城抗日战役、一九三三年夏察北抗日战役、一九三六年冬绥远抗日战役中牺牲的官兵和东北抗日义勇军抗日联军牺牲的官兵。（五）一九三七年至一九四五年因参加抗日战争牺牲的八路军、新四军及其他人民抗日部队官兵。国民党军官兵（包括空军）确因抗日阵亡者也包括在内，但在此期间因参加反共内战而死者不在内。（六）在人民解放战争中牺牲的人民解放军指战员。起义后因参加人民解放战争而牺牲的原国民党军官兵也包括在内。（七）一九一九年五四运动以来因参加各种革命斗争被帝国主义和国内反动派杀害的烈士，因参加革命斗争入狱病死者也包括在内。
