The financial and economic work of the past year has undergone tremendous changes, and this change is progressing in a positive direction. At the same time, due to the unfamiliarity of the financial and economic leadership with the national financial situation at the time and the lack of experience, some shortcomings and errors have also arisen in the work. On the occasion of the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, it is beneficial to review the financial and economic work of the past year in order to improve future financial and economic work and continue to strive for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation.

I. Difficult Circumstances a Year Ago

1949 was the year in which the Liberation War achieved a decisive victory, but the financial and economic situation that year was very difficult. The difficulties came from two aspects: On the one hand, as a result of imperialist aggression and the long-term rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, a considerable amount of China's essential grain and cotton had historically relied on imports; water conservancy projects had been severely damaged, causing disasters year after year, with 1949 being the most severe; twelve years of inflation, under the leadership of bureaucratic capital, had allowed speculative markets to control industry and commerce, and the people were constantly disturbed by currency depreciation and soaring prices; as a result of the victory of the Liberation War, we had to inherit such a legacy. On the other hand, last year's unprecedented revolutionary advance meant that we had to take in all the old armies and old personnel who were unwilling to resist, implementing a policy of "three people eating the food of five," which placed a heavy financial burden on the Central People's Government. Not only that, but the railways had to be restored, Shanghai, which was under blockade, had to be supported, the war had blocked urban-rural exchange, tax revenues were minimal, and expenditures were huge, so we had to temporarily rely on issuing banknotes to make up for the huge fiscal deficit. The result was that, on the one hand, it solved the needs of the Liberation War and key recovery at the time, but on the other hand, it still could not avoid the situation of inflation and price fluctuations.

The imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries once predicted that although China's Liberation War would be victorious, the financial and economic difficulties would be insurmountable. Therefore, the imperialists and remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, in order to aggravate our difficulties, carried out bombing and blockades, and expanded the propaganda of famine. However, the situation since the establishment of the Central People's Government a year ago has been completely contrary to their delusions. Under the wise leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, relying on the support of all democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, and the entire people across the country, the correct policies were decided in a timely manner, overcoming numerous difficulties in a short period of time and reversing the serious financial and economic situation.

II. Unified Financial and Economic Work

In terms of financial and economic management, in the early stages of the Liberation War, the liberated areas were divided. At that time, the policy of unified leadership and decentralized management in business that we adopted had achieved great results. Now that the mainland of China has been liberated and the situation has changed, this policy must also change accordingly. Therefore, the first major measure taken by the Central People's Government for finance and economy was to implement unified management and leadership of national finance and economy starting in March 1950. To this end, the State Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Decision on Unified National Financial and Economic Work" on March 3. The basic contents of this decision are threefold: The first is to unify national financial revenue and expenditure, the second is to unify national material allocation, and the third is to unify national cash management. The unification of financial revenue and expenditure enables the central government's revenue, which is the main part of the national income, to be concentrated on the country's main expenditures. The unification of national material allocation concentrates the important materials owned by the state, such as grain, cotton yarn, and industrial equipment, from a scattered and weak state, turning them into an effective force. The method of unifying national cash management is to have the People's Bank of China uniformly manage and centrally allocate all cash belonging to the government but dispersed in various enterprises, institutions, and troops. This not only avoids the phenomenon of excessive currency in society, but also greatly increases the cash that the country can use. The same result of these three types of unification is to avoid the dispersion and waste of financial and material resources and achieve the purpose of concentrated use. This effect has a significant impact on reversing the difficult financial and economic situation. Such unified management is a major step forward in the history of our country. People now talk about the Central People's Government being an effective government, and ask in surprise why a measure like unified national cash management can be realized with just one order. The answer to this question is simple: this government is not just any government, it is a government led by communists that wholeheartedly serves the people. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, such things can be done, and should be done. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government, the degree of currency depreciation and price fluctuations was so great, and the people suffered so much loss, one of the important reasons being that bureaucratic warlords and wealthy families stole and misappropriated the state's cash and used it for speculation and market manipulation. The people's losses became their private savings.

III. Balancing Revenue and Expenditure, Stabilizing Finance and Prices

To stabilize finance and prices, it is necessary to first strive to bring financial revenue and expenditure close to balance, and the key to balancing finance lies in economizing expenditure and rectifying revenue.

Since the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army unconditionally serve the people, the method of economizing expenditure, in a certain period, cannot but be to tighten the treatment of military, government, and education personnel. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army and the vast number of staff of the People's Government continue to live a hard life of supply system or low salaries, saving the state's financial expenditure. This is the glory of the People's Liberation Army and the vast number of staff of the People's Government.

There are two main items of fiscal revenue: one is public grain and the other is tax revenue. The income from both is approximately equal. In addition, a batch of public bonds was issued, although not large in number, it played a great role in withdrawing currency and regulating cash.

The collection of public grain last year was carried out under difficult circumstances. Most areas were newly liberated areas, unfamiliar with the people and the land, and time was tight. The financial and economic responsible authorities had neglected to stipulate a unified national collection method beforehand. Therefore, although it was generally collected, there were problems such as uneven burden, coercion, and commandism.

Tax work was even more lacking in experience. The tax regulations stipulated at the beginning of 1950 were a step forward in unifying taxes, but in many aspects, they were neither convenient for industry and commerce nor conducive to state revenue. It was only after the government and industry and commerce jointly revised them that they were brought into line.

Although there were some shortcomings in public grain, taxes, and public bonds, due to our rapid correction of these shortcomings and the enthusiastic support of the people across the country, the expected goals were generally achieved in terms of national fiscal revenue. Only when the revenue reaches the requirements of the 1950 budget can the state's cash expenditure be transformed from relying on issuing currency to relying on tax revenue. Only when public grain is collected can the food for military and government personnel be supplied and the food supply for major cities be guaranteed.

Balancing revenue and expenditure, coupled with the unified management of finance and economy, has led to a stable financial situation throughout the country since March this year. The direct consequence of this is that, in terms of prices, there has been a fundamental change in nature. That is to say, the factors of price increases caused by currency depreciation no longer exist. However, this only solves one aspect of the price problem, and it is also necessary to solve the other aspect of sufficient material supply in order to stabilize prices that have fluctuated for twelve years. The material supply mentioned here must guarantee the most important materials in the most important markets in order to control prices. These materials must not only be able to supply normal market needs, but also have the ability to defeat any speculators. The government has made tremendous efforts in terms of grain and cotton yarn. In terms of grain, it has carried out the largest-scale transportation in Chinese history, and state-owned trading agencies have supplied huge quantities of grain to major cities and disaster areas across the country. Under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the unfortunate era of grain or yarn frequently leading price increases, if we do not make mistakes in this regard in the future, it should be said that it is gone forever.

After March 1950, the nature of the domestic market has changed. The market dominated by bureaucratic capital for the purpose of speculation and undermining the national economy has basically been changed to a market under the leadership of the state-owned economy for the purpose of serving the people's lives and restoring and developing production. There is no doubt that, from now on, the leadership of commercial speculative capital over the domestic market will never exist again.

While ensuring the leadership of the domestic market, state-owned trade has also gained the initiative in international trade, in conjunction with private foreign trade. Semi-colonial foreign trade has been changed to protectionist trade. Foreign goods that are not needed by the Chinese national economy have been stopped from being imported, while surplus agricultural and sideline products in the country have been exported to the maximum extent under the principle of protecting farmers rather than exploiting them. The era of trade deficits and foreign exchange liabilities for a hundred years has also been completely changed since 1950.

IV. Focusing on Restoring Production

Simultaneous with the above series of financial, monetary, and trade measures, the Central People's Government implemented a policy of focusing on restoring industrial and agricultural production. There have been two focuses of the recovery work in the past year: one focus is on transportation, especially railways, and the other focus is on water conservancy and agriculture. In terms of railways, from 1949 to May of this year, a total of 8,718 kilometers were repaired, accounting for 40.39 percent of the national railways in operation. The original railways in the country have been basically completely restored. In terms of water conservancy, the total earthwork for spring repair projects this year reached more than 350 million cubic meters nationwide. The area sown with cotton fields exceeded the originally planned increase. There is no doubt that industrialization is our goal of nation-building, and we are striving for it. However, the semi-colonial economy of the past century has left China's modern industry, which accounts for only about 10 percent of the national economy, in an extremely fragile and chaotic situation. To achieve the nationwide restoration and development of Chinese industry, it is necessary to first create some basic conditions. The first is to restore transportation, especially railway transportation. This is both a need of the revolutionary war and a need to connect cities and rural areas across the country. Obstructed transportation will forever paralyze the national urban and rural economy, making it fundamentally impossible to restore and develop industry. The second is to restore agriculture. The purpose of restoring agriculture is to quickly solve the needs for grain and industrial raw materials (especially cotton), and at the same time open up a vast market for urban industry. After agriculture is properly restored, the grain supply in large cities and the raw materials for the textile industry will no longer depend on imperialism, and the foreign exchange consumed by grain and cotton, which have been the main import items of our country for many years, can be used to purchase machinery and accumulate funds for industrialization. However, the most important key to the restoration of agriculture at present, in addition to completing the national land reform, lies in water conservancy. As long as a few major rivers can avoid floods and play a certain role in irrigation, coupled with some agricultural technology improvements, the face of agriculture can be greatly changed. This year's water conservancy projects and the people's governments at all levels leading the people to actively prevent disasters have enabled tens of millions of mu of farmland that could have been affected by disasters to achieve a bumper harvest. This year, the country has a bumper harvest and agricultural production has increased. Both grain and cotton have exceeded the original production increase plan. Cotton has been able to approach self-sufficiency, and grain has been able to achieve complete self-sufficiency. In terms of industry, some regions and some sectors have exceeded pre-war levels. In the Northeast, the total value of industrial production, which is a more reliable plan this year, is equal to 193 percent of last year. These industrial works are all preparing conditions for full recovery and development in three to five years.

V. Adjusting Industry and Commerce

The above series of financial and economic measures has carried out a fundamental reorganization of the Chinese national economy. That is, it has already moved the Chinese national economy from a backward, semi-colonial and semi-feudal track to a progressive, new-democratic, independent and autonomous track. This is a historic transformation. This transformation has brought temporary but drastic pain. The fundamental difficulty lies in the fact that the economic false prosperity, which served imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism and feudalism, and whose basic contents were inflation and commercial speculation, suddenly disappeared. As a result, a series of socio-economic organizations that relied on imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and that existed and developed through inflation and commercial speculation, suddenly lost their basis. Many industries and businesses suddenly became depressed, and large-scale phenomena of shutdowns, closures, and unemployment occurred. That is to say, the pathological state of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal economy was fully exposed. In addition, taxes and public bonds were collected simultaneously in various cities in the spring of 1950, and a large amount of currency was withdrawn, further revealing this state of depression. Many staff members in our financial and economic system lacked experience, and were also unable to find ways to reduce and even increased the degree of this pain in some places. This situation had changed by the summer of this year.

This summer, the most common problem across the country is that, on the one hand, the national financial and economic work has seen new life, and on the other hand, there is a universal demand for adjusting industry and commerce. That is to say, after the track of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal national economy has been dismantled, the issue of industry and commerce should be arranged according to the track of the new democracy, that is, the people's economic track stipulated in the Common Program. The most prominent of these are three basic links: 1. Adjusting the relationship between public and private sectors; 2. Adjusting the relationship between labor and capital; 3. Adjusting the relationship between production and sales.

There are two basic aspects to adjusting the relationship between the public and private sectors: the first is adjusting the relationship between public and private industries and businesses, and the second is adjusting the burden.

The essence of adjusting the relationship between public and private industries and businesses is, on the one hand, to establish the leading position of the state-owned economy, and on the other hand, to enable the private capitalist economy to be in its proper place under the leadership of the state-owned economy. After financial balance, financial and price stability, and state-owned trade has replaced speculative business to become the leading factor in the market, the leading position of the state-owned economy has been basically determined. At this time, one aspect of the task of the state-owned economy is how to enable the private economy to "be in its proper place." The main outlet here is to increase the purchasing power of farmers, but the emergency and also the normal way is to implement processing orders or other forms of assistance for some major private industries, so that they produce according to the needs of the national economy, and no longer produce for commercial speculation, and obtain their own legitimate profits in this rational production. For private business, under the premise of not allowing speculation, state-owned trade should give private business a way out in terms of prices and business scope, and jointly serve urban-rural mutual assistance and internal and external exchanges.

The essence of adjusting the burden issue is to appropriately reduce the burden on the people under the premise of ensuring the needs of national finance. In terms of agricultural tax, the summer and autumn tax rates in the new areas this year have been reduced from the average tax rate of 17 percent of total agricultural income last year to 13 percent. In terms of industrial and commercial taxes, the number of commodity tax items has been reduced from 1,136 to 358, industrial and commercial business taxes are all levied at the rate, and salt tax is halved. These measures have all achieved good results.

The relationship between labor and capital is now basically on the right track. In the past year, there have been biases in two aspects: on the one hand, some capitalists stubbornly opposed the liberation of the working class and did not recognize the necessary democratic rights of workers, but on the other hand, some workers had excessively high demands on capitalists. The solution to this problem basically follows three principles: First, the democratic rights of the working class must be recognized. Second, developing production is beneficial to the people's economy. On this point, both labor and capital are serving the people and are glorious. Third, problems between labor and capital should be resolved through consultation, and then transition to a more fixed contractual relationship.

Finally, there is the relationship between production and sales. This is how to gradually overcome the anarchic state in production. Of course, adjusting the relationship between production and sales is one of the most difficult problems in economic reorganization. Highly planned production is currently impossible, but after commercial speculation is basically controlled, relatively and preliminarily planned production has become possible, and the phenomenon of production and sales balance should be gradually realized.

After the above three problems are solved, coupled with the national bumper harvest, China's economic situation has greatly improved.

VI. Continue to Move Forward Steadily

The changes in the past year have been huge. China's people's economy has begun a historic change. In the changes of this year, at major junctures, it has once again proved the brilliance of Chairman Mao Zedong's wise leadership. Under Chairman Mao's correct leadership, under the guarantee of the great victory of the revolutionary war and the people's regime, the Chinese people have exerted great potential strength in financial and economic work, and have overcome the initial difficulties in financial and economic work at an extraordinary speed, striving for the initial improvement of the financial and economic situation. It must be emphasized here that the experience of the Soviet Union has been of great help to us and is deeply worthy of our gratitude. Learning from the experience of the Soviet Union with an open mind should be our regular task in the future.

The experience of the past year is rich. There are two main aspects to the experience. On the one hand, the great role of the people's regime in financial and economic work has not been sufficiently recognized; the potential strength of the Chinese economy has not been sufficiently estimated; such conservative views are wrong. The facts of the past year prove that by properly estimating the potential of the Chinese people and things, and under the guarantee of the people's regime, we have the possibility of extremely creative achievements. On the other hand, it is necessary to recognize that China's socio-economic situation is complex. We are in an era of the joint dictatorship of four democratic classes under the leadership of the working class and the coexistence of five types of economy. All financial and economic measures must be under the leadership of the state-owned economy, taking into account all aspects, and dividing labor and cooperating. It must be affirmed that the leading power of the state-owned economy, which is socialist in nature, cannot be shaken, and the remaining four types of economy, namely the state-capitalist economy jointly operated by the state and private individuals, the cooperative economy with a semi-socialist nature, the private capitalist economy, and the individual economy of farmers and handicraftsmen, must each be in their proper place. Any simple and one-sided methods that violate this principle will not work. We must carry out our work step by step in accordance with Chairman Mao's policy of steady progress.

Under normal circumstances, it is estimated that the financial and economic situation in 1951 may be better than in 1950, because we may have the opportunity to work in a more planned way than this year. However, the new war threat provoked by American imperialism is increasing day by day. In this regard, we should have sufficient vigilance. Striving for the best goals, while also making plans for the worst-case scenario, we can stand in an invincible position and steadily strive for the continued improvement and fundamental improvement of the financial and economic situation.

### 中华人民共和国过去一年财政和经济工作的状况

　　中华人民共和国过去一年财政和经济工作的状况
    陈云
    一年来的财政经济工作，有巨大的变化，这个变化是向好的方面前进。同时，由于财经领导机关对当时全国财经情况不熟悉，经验缺乏，因而，在工作中也产生了一些缺点和错误。在开国第一个周年纪念之际，检查过去一年来的财经工作，对于改进今后的财经工作，继续争取国家财政经济的基本好转，是有益的。
    一、一年前的困难情况
    一九四九年是解放战争取得决定性胜利的一年，但是这一年的财政经济形势则是很困难的。困难来自两个方面：一个方面，帝国主义的侵略和国民党反动派长期统治的结果，我国民生必需的粮食、棉花，不小数量是历来依靠进口的；水利事业遭到大破坏，年年受灾，而以一九四九年为最重；十二年来的通货膨胀，在官僚资本的领导之下，投机市场统制着工商业，人民日夜不安于通货贬值、物价飞涨；解放战争胜利的结果，我们不得不承受这样一份遗产。另一方面，去年空前规模的革命进军，对于一切不愿抵抗的旧军队与旧人员采取一律包下来，实行三个人的饭五个人吃的政策，中央人民政府的财政负担是很重的。不仅如此，铁道必须恢复，被封锁的上海必须支援，战争阻塞了城乡交流，税收甚微，支出很大，我们曾不得不暂时仍旧依靠发行钞票来弥补庞大的财政赤字。其结果是：一方面解决了当时解放战争和重点恢复的需要，另一方面则仍不能避免通货膨胀、物价波动的局面。
    帝国主义者和国民党反动派曾经预言：中国的解放战争虽然胜利，但是财政经济的困难是无法克服的。因此，帝国主义者和国民党反动派残余分子，为了加重我们的困难，实行轰炸和封锁，扩大灾荒的宣传，但是，中央人民政府成立之后一年以来的情况，完全与他们的妄想相反，在毛泽东同志的英明领导下，依靠了全国各民主阶层、民主党派、人民团体、全体人民的支持，适时地决定了正确的政策，在短时期内，克服了重重困难，扭转了严重的财政经济的局势。
    二、统一财政经济工作
    在财政经济的管理问题上，解放战争的初期，解放区是被分割的。那时，我们所采行的政策上统一领导，业务上分散管理的方针，曾经收得了极大成效。全国大陆解放了，形势改变了，此项方针也必须随着改变。因此，中央人民政府对于财政经济所采取的第一个重大措施，是于一九五○年三月起实行统一国家财政经济的管理与领导。中央人民政府政务院为此于三月三日颁布了“关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定”。这个决定的基本内容有三：第一是统一全国财政收支，第二是统一全国物资调度，第三是统一全国现金管理。财政收支的统一，使国家收入中主要部分的中央收入，集中使用于国家的主要开支。全国物资调度的统一，使国家所有的重要物资，如粮食、纱布、工业器材，从分散无力的状态中，集中起来，而变为有效的力量。统一全国现金管理的办法，是把所有属于政府的但是分散在各企业、机关、部队的现金，由中国人民银行统一管理，集中调度，这就不但避免了社会上通货过多的现象，而且大大增加了国家能够使用的现金。这三种统一的同一结果是避免了财力物力的分散和浪费，达到了集中使用的目的。这种效果对于扭转困难的财政经济局势是有重大作用的。这样的统一管理，在我国的历史上是一大进步，人们现在谈论着中央人民政府是一个有效力的政府，惊问统一全国现金管理这样的措施，为什么一个命令就能实现，回答这个问题是简单的，这就是：这个政府不是别的政府，是一个以共产党人为领导的全心全意为人民服务的政府。在共产党领导之下，这样的事情可以做到，而且应该做到。国民党反动政府统治时期，通货贬值物价波动的程度那样大，人民的损失那样多，其中重要原因之一，就是因为官僚军阀豪门偷窃挪用了国家的现金，运用于投机，操纵市场。人民的损失，就变成了他们的私蓄。
    三、平衡收支，稳定金融物价
    要求稳定金融物价，必先争取财政收支接近平衡，而平衡财政的关键，在于节约支出，整顿收入。
    由于人民政府与人民解放军是无条件地为人民服务的，节约支出的办法，在一定时期内，又不能不是紧缩军政公教人员的待遇，因此，使人民解放军及人民政府广大工作人员继续过着艰苦的供给制或低薪的生活，节省了国家的财政支出，这是人民解放军与人民政府广大工作人员的光荣。
    财政收入的主要项目有二：一是公粮，二是税收。两者的收入，大约相等。此外，还发了一批公债，虽然为数不多，但对回笼货币调节现金一事起了很大的作用。
    去年征收公粮是在一种困难情况下进行的。大部地区是新解放区，人地生疏，时间局促，财经负责机关事前又疏忽了规定全国统一征收的办法，因此，虽然大体征起，但有畸轻畸重，强迫命令等项毛病。
    税收工作，更加缺少经验。一九五○年初所规定的税务章则，在统一税务方面是前进了一步，但有不少方面，既不便于工商，也不利于国家收入，经过政府与工商界合力修改，才纳入正轨。
    虽然在公粮税收公债等方面，有过若干缺点，但由于我们迅速改正这些缺点，由于全国人民热烈支持，因此在国家财政收入方面，大体上达到了预期的目的。只有收入方面达到了一九五○年概算的要求，国家财政的现金支出，才能从依靠发行货币来解决，转变为依靠税收来解决。只有征起了公粮，才能供应军政人员的食粮和保证大城市的粮食供应。
    平衡了收支，又加上财政经济的统一管理，这样就使得今年三月以来，在全国范围内出现了金融稳定的局面。其直接的后果是：物价问题上，有了一个根本性质的改变。就是说，由通货贬值而来的物价高涨的因素，已经不存在了。但是，这还只解决了物价问题的一个方面，还必须解决充分的物资供应另一个方面，才能把波动了十二年的物价稳定下来。这里所说的物资供应，是必须对于最主要的物资在最主要的市场上有了保证，才能控制物价。这种物资，不仅要能供应正常的市场需要，而且要有战胜任何投机者的能力，政府在粮食与花纱布方面，作了巨大规模的努力。粮食一项曾进行了中国有史以来最大规模的一次调运，国营贸易机关供给了全国各大城市及灾区巨大数量的粮食。在国民党反动统治下，经常由粮食或纱布领导物价上涨的不幸时代，如果我们以后在这方面不犯错误，应当说，从此已一去不复返了。
    一九五○年三月以后，国内市场的性质已经改变，官僚资本操纵下的以投机和败坏国民经济为目的的市场，已经基本上改变为在国营经济领导下的以服务于人民生活与恢复及发展生产为目的的市场了。毫无疑问，从此以后，商业投机资本对于国内市场的领导权，永远不会存在了。
    国营贸易在确保了国内市场的领导权的同时，在国际贸易上，在与私人对外贸易结合之下，也取得了主动权。半殖民地性的对外贸易，已经改变为保护贸易了。非中国国民经济所需要的外国商品，已停止进口，而国内多余的农产品与农副产品，在保护农民而不是剥削农民的原则下，实行了最大限度的出口。百年来入超与外汇负债的时代，也从一九五○年起完全改变了。
    四、重点恢复生产
    与上述一系列的财政、金融、贸易措施同时，中央人民政府对于工农业生产实行了重点恢复的政策。一年来的恢复工作中有两个重点：一个重点在交通，尤其是铁道，另一个重点在水利和农业。铁路方面，自一九四九年至今年五月，共修复八千七百一十八公里，占全国通车铁路的百分之四○·三九，全国原有铁道，已基本上完全恢复。水利方面，今年春修工程，全国土工达三亿五千余万公方。棉田播种的面积，超过了原定增植的计划。毫无疑问，工业化是我们建国的目标，我们正为此而奋斗。但是，百年来的半殖民地经济，使中国在国民经济中仅占百分之十左右的一点近代工业，处于异常脆弱，而且十分混乱的局面。要实现全国规模的恢复与发展中国工业，首先要创造一些基本条件。第一是恢复交通，尤其是铁路交通。这一方面是革命战争的需要，另一方面也是沟通全国城市与农村的需要，阻塞的交通，将永远使全国城乡经济处于瘫痪的局面，根本不可能进行工业的恢复和发展。第二是恢复农业。恢复农业的目的，在于迅速解决粮食与工业原料（尤其是棉花）的需要，同时即为城市工业开辟广大的市场。农业适当恢复之后，大城市的粮食供应与纺织工业的原料才能不依赖帝国主义，并使过去多少年来，占我们国家主要入口项目的粮食棉花所消耗的外汇，可以转而购买机器，为工业化积累资金。但是，农业的恢复，目前最重要的关键，除完成全国土地改革外，即在于水利，只要几条主要河流能避免了水灾，并起了一定的灌溉作用，加上若干农业技术改良，农业的面貌，就可以大大地改观。今年的水利工程和各地人民政府领导人民积极防灾，使几千万亩可能被灾的农田，得到了丰收。今年全国丰收，农业增产。在粮食和棉花方面都超过了原订的增产计划，棉花已能接近自给，粮食则已经能够完全自给。工业方面，在某些地区和某些部门中，已超过了战前水平。在东北，今年比较可靠的计划的工业生产总值，等于去年百分之一百九十三。工业方面的这些工作，都是为全面恢复以及在三、五年后的发展准备条件。
    五、调整工商业
    上述一系列的财经措施，使中国国民经济进行了一次根本性质的改组。即已经把中国国民经济从落后的、半殖民地半封建的轨道上，移到了进步的、新民主主义的、独立自主的轨道上来了。这是一个历史性的转变。这一个转变，曾经带来了暂时的然而是剧烈的痛苦。根本的困难在于：服务于帝国主义、官僚资本主义和封建主义的，以通货膨胀和商业投机为基本内容的经济上的虚假繁荣，突然不存在了。因而使依靠帝国主义封建主义和官僚资本主义而生存及通货膨胀和商业投机而存在而发展的一系列的社会经济组织，都顿时失去了依据。许多工商业突然萧条，停工、歇业、失业的现象大量发生。这就是说，半殖民地半封建经济的病态，充分暴露出来了。加上税收与公债，在一九五○年春季同时分别在各城市征收，通货大量回笼，更加显露了这种萧条情况。我们财经系统中许多工作人员经验不足，也没有能够事先设法减少并还在若干地方增加了这种痛苦的程度。这种状况，到今年夏季已有了改变。
    今年夏季，全国最普遍的问题，一方面是全国财经工作已见新生，另一方面则是普遍要求调整工商业，就是说，在半殖民地半封建的国民经济轨道拆毁了之后，应当按照新民主主义的轨道，即共同纲领所规定的人民经济轨道来安排工商业问题。其中最突出的是三个基本环节：一、调整公私关系，二、调整劳资关系，三、调整产销关系。
    调整公私关系有两个基本的方面：第一是调整公私工商业关系，第二是调整负担。
    所谓调整公私工商业关系的实质，是一方面确立国家经济的领导地位，一方面要使私人资本主义经济在国家经济领导下面各得其所。在财政平衡，金融物价趋于稳定，国家贸易已经代替投机商业成为市场的领导因素之后，国家经济的领导地位已经基本上确定了。这个时候，国家经济的一个方面的任务就是如何使私人经济能“得其所”。这里主要的出路是增加农民的购买力，但救急的也是正常的办法，则是对于若干主要的私人工业实行加工订货或其他方式的扶助，使他们按照国民经济的需要而生产，而不再是为商业投机而生产，在这种合理的生产中，取得自己的正当的利润。对于私人商业，则是在不允许投机的前提下，国营贸易应在价格与营业范围上给私人商业以出路，共同为城乡互助、内外交流而服务。
    调整负担问题的实质，是在保证国家财政需要的前提下，适当地减轻民负。在农业税方面，今年新区夏秋征税率均已由去年占农业总收入的平均百分之十七的税率，减为百分之十三。工商业税方面，货物税目由一一三六种减为三五八种，工商营业税皆依率计征、盐税减半。这些措施均收到了良好的效果。
    劳资关系，现在基本上已上了正轨。过去一年，曾经有过两方面的偏向：一方面，有些资本家顽固地反对工人阶级的解放，不承认工人必要的民主权利，但另一方面，也曾经发生过一些工人对资本家有过高的要求。这一个问题的解决，基本上遵循了三条原则：第一，工人阶级的民主权利，必须确认。第二，发展生产对人民经济有利，在这一点上，无论劳资，都是为人民服务的，都是光荣的。第三，劳资间的问题，用协商方式解决，然后过渡到更固定的合同关系。
    最后，是产销关系。这是如何逐步地克服生产中的无政府状态问题。当然，调整产销关系是在经济改组中最繁难的一个问题，高度计划性的生产目前还不可能，但是，在商业投机基本上受到控制之后，相对地、初步地有计划的生产，已经成为可能，产销平衡的现象，应当逐步可以实现。
    在上述三个问题获得解决之后，加上全国丰收，中国的经济状况，已有很大的好转了。
    六、继续稳步前进
    一年来的变化是巨大的。中国人民经济已经开始了历史性的变化。这一年的变化中，在重大关头上，又一次证明毛泽东主席英明领导的光辉。在毛主席正确领导下，在革命战争伟大胜利和人民政权的保证下，中国人民在财经工作方面发挥了伟大的潜在力量，以异乎寻常的速度，渡过了财经工作中初期的困难，争取了财政经济状况的开始好转。这里必须着重提到，苏联的经验，对于我们有极大的帮助，深深值得我们感谢。虚心学习苏联的经验，应当是我们今后的经常任务。
    一年来的经验，是丰富的。主要的经验，有两个方面。一方面，对于人民政权在财政经济工作方面的伟大作用，认识不足；对于中国经济的潜在力量，估计不足；这样的保守观点是不对的。一年的事实证明，恰当地估计中国人与物两方面的潜力，在人民政权的保证下，我们有极大的创造性的成就的可能。另一方面，必须认识中国社会经济情况是复杂的。我们是处在工人阶级领导下四个民主阶级联合专政与五种经济并存的时代，一切财政经济措施，必须是在国营经济领导下，统筹兼顾，分工合作。必须确认社会主义性质的国家经济的领导权，这是不能动摇的，又必须使其余四种经济，即国家与私人合营的国家资本主义经济，带半社会主义性质的合作社经济，私人资本主义经济和农民及手工业者的个体经济，各得其所。任何违背这个原则的简单的片面的办法，都是行不通的。我们必须依照毛主席稳步前进的方针，有步骤地进行我们的工作。
    一九五一年的财政经济状况，在一般情况下，估计比一九五○年可能还要好一些，这是因为我们已有可能比较今年更加有计划地工作。但是，美帝国主义所挑拨的新战争威胁，是在日益增加。在这方面，我们应有足够的警惕。向最好的目标争取，同时又作在最坏情况下的打算，我们就可以立于不败的地位，稳步地争取财政经济状况的继续好转和根本好转。
