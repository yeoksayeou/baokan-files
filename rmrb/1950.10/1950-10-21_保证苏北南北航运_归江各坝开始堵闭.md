    Guarantee North-South Navigation in Northern Jiangsu
    Closing of Guijiang Dams Begins

    [Reported by this newspaper] Recently, the water level of the Grand Canal has been gradually decreasing. In order to guarantee north-south navigation in northern Jiangsu, a decision has been made to close the Guijiang Dams (Editor's note: The Guijiang Dams were opened during this summer's flood season). The dam openings have been surveyed and measured in the field, and a dam-closing organization has been formally established. Because the bottom of the dams was cleared during flood prevention, digging four or five meters deeper than in the past, closing the dams now requires more manpower and materials. In addition to sending personnel to Jiangnan to purchase large cables and other equipment for river work, other necessary materials and firewood have been successively transported to the site. People are actively organizing civilian laborers and boats, with over a thousand laborers and two hundred boats participating in the dam-closing work. The dam-closing procedure is to close the Shan Dam first, then the Bi Hu Dam, and finally the Lanjiang Dam. The closing of other dams will be decided based on changes in the water situation. Work officially commenced on the 11th of this month.

    保证苏北南北航运
    归江各坝开始堵闭
    【本报讯】近来运河水位日渐降落，为保证苏北南北航运交通、已决定进行堵闭归江各坝（编者按：归江各坝系今年夏汛期启放的），坝口已经过实际勘察测量，堵坝机构亦已正式成立。因为夏防期间，坝底已经清除，比过去挖深四、五公尺，现在进行堵闭需要人力物力较大，除专人赴江南采购行江大缆等器材外，其他所需料柴已陆续运到，并积极组织民工船只、将有千余民工、二百余只船参加堵坝工作。堵坝的程序是先堵山坝、次璧虎坝，后栏江坝，其他各坝视水情变化再行决定，已于本月十一日正式开工。
