　　Present the Completion of Production Supporting the Liberation of Taiwan as a Gift to Celebrate the First Anniversary of the Founding of the Nation
    National Railway Labor Model Li Yonglu
    This year's October 1st is the anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. This day is rich in historical and revolutionary significance, and it is also the most joyful and encouraging day for our 475 million Chinese people. Who gave us such a happy and celebrative day? It is thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party, which has led us workers to improve our lives, enlightened us to gradually increase our awareness, and enabled our people's railway enterprises and all production to rapidly recover and develop.
    Today, I feel that the post-liberation society is very different from the old society of the past. In the past, workers lived the life of exploited and oppressed beasts of burden all day long, unable to eat their fill, wear warm clothes, or sleep well. I remember very clearly that in November 1948, the second year of the Kuomintang "takeover," the Kuomintang reactionaries, in order to expand their armed forces, grabbed young workers every day, regardless of whether you were a worker or a businessman, they grabbed you when they saw you, and in the end, they even went to each household to grab people. At that time, I was really unfortunate and was caught by them three times in a row. The first two times I hid elsewhere, but the last time I was about to be caught, so I had to hide in the ceiling to escape. At that time, I could only swallow my resentment, who would dare to open their mouths? Every day I went to work, I was so tired that I didn't even have time to rest, and the suffering in life was even worse. Who would ask you about these things? At that time, the lives of six people could not be maintained, and the sixteen-year-old child had to drop out of school.
    Since the liberation of the Fengtai area, we workers have finally seen the light of day, our status has also been improved, and our lives have been guaranteed. I once heard the takeover personnel say: Liberation and increased production can improve the lives of workers. This was the first comforting thing I had heard in my life. Later, comrades from the Party, government, and trade union in the factory took the initiative to go to the workers' homes to understand the situation and give comfort. In our daily work, responsible comrades at all levels—section chiefs and directors—often participated in the work on-site and understood the difficulties in the work, and gave timely solutions and help. I remember that before liberation, I didn't even dare to go to the Kuomintang reactionaries' yamen. Today, I am not only not despised, but also have a very friendly conversation with Premier Zhou. Now I often hear and see celebration meetings being held everywhere, rewarding workers, which is really unprecedented. Moreover, when our workers went abroad in the past, they could only be beasts of burden, how could they be welcomed by peace-loving people from all countries as they are now? When I went to the Soviet Union and Hungary, the people there were particularly kind to us. This made me deeply feel that only under the leadership of the working class party can the new China move towards prosperity and happiness.
    American imperialism wants to provoke war again, and it also wants to use atomic weapons to threaten us. This shameless behavior has aroused the hatred of every peace-loving person. We must unite, support Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou's protest, and resolutely fight against the aggressors.
    Comrades of the working class! In the future, we must work harder, learn from the working class of the world's democratic countries led by the Soviet Union, do a good job in our people's enterprises, increase production, and implement a cost accounting system. Under the call of the higher authorities, we must complete the production tasks with active actions, strengthen our sense of responsibility in our work, heighten our vigilance, and eliminate accidents, so as to support the army in liberating the whole of China. We must take the above determination as a gift to commemorate the first anniversary of the National Day.

　　以完成生产支援解放台湾做纪念开国第一周年献礼
    全国铁路劳动模范  李永禄
    今年的十月一日，是中华人民共和国成立一周年纪念日。这个日子，说起来是富有一种历史性及革命的意义的，也是我们中国四万七千五百万人民最欢欣鼓舞的一天。这样快乐而可庆的日子，究竟是谁给的呢？是由于共产党的领导，是它领导我们工人改善了生活，启发我们觉悟程度逐渐提高，使我们人民铁路企业和一切生产，迅速恢复和发展。
    今天，我感到解放后的社会与过去的旧社会相比，是大不相同了。从前的工人，整日过着被剥削压迫的牛马生活，吃不饱，穿不暖，睡不好。我记得很清楚，在一九四八年的十一月，也就是国民党“接收”的第二年，国民党反动派为了扩大它们的武装势力，每天抢抓青年工友，不管你是工人也好，商人也好，见着就乱抓，到最后还到每个住户的家中去抓。那时我真不幸，被它们连抓三次。头两次我躲到别处去了，最后一次眼看就要被抓住了，我只好藏到顶棚里躲避起来，这才算逃了活命。当时的怨恨，只有咽在肚里，谁又敢张嘴呢？每天去干活，累得连休息时间都没有，生活方面的痛苦更不用说了，这些，又有谁来问你呢？当时六口人的生活就不能维持，并使十六岁的孩子中途失了学。
    自丰台地区解放后，我们工人阶级才算见天日了，地位也提高了，生活方面更不用说，也有了保障了。曾听接管人员说：解放了提高生产就可改善工人生活。这是我有生以来听见的第一次舒心的话。后来工厂中党政工团的同志们，主动到工人家中了解情况，给予安慰。我们在每日工作中，各级负责同志——段长、主任时常到现场参与工作，并了解工作中有那些困难，及时给予解决与帮助。记得在解放前，连国民党反动派的衙门口都不敢去。今日的我，不但受不到鄙视，并很亲切地和周总理交谈。现在时常听到和见到各地开庆功会，奖励工人，这真是空前未有的事。还有，我们工人从前到国外，只有当牛马，那有像现在那样，接受各国爱好和平的人民去欢迎呢？我出国去苏联、匈牙利，那里的人民对我们格外亲热。这使我深深感到，唯有在工人阶级的政党领导下，新中国才能向富强康乐之途迈进。
    美帝国主义又想挑拨战争，他还想利用原子武器来恐吓我们。这种无耻的行为，引起了每个爱好和平人民的痛恨。我们要团结起来，拥护周总理兼外长的抗议，坚决和侵略者斗争。
    工人阶级的同志们！在今后更加努力，向以苏联为首的世界各民主国家的工人阶级学习，搞好我们的人民企业，提高生产，实行核算成本制度。我们要在上级的号召下，用积极的行动完成生产任务，在工作中加强责任心，提高警惕，消灭事故，好支援大军解放全中国。我们要以以上的决心，做为纪念第一个周年国庆节的献礼。
