Heartfelt Sympathy, Warm Support
Working People of Southeast European Countries Actively Support the Korean People's Struggle
(Comprehensive report by our newspaper)

The heinous war of aggression waged by U.S. imperialism in Korea has aroused boundless anger and hatred among peace-loving people around the world. The working people of the Southeast European people's democracies have expressed their firm protest and strong indignation at this heinous crime of U.S. imperialism in destroying world peace. They are not only stepping up production at their work posts to strengthen the forces defending world peace, but also providing practical material assistance to support the heroic struggle of the Korean people.

The Hungarian People's Medical Team, purchased with voluntary donations from the Hungarian working people for medical equipment and composed of Hungarian medical personnel, arrived in Pyongyang on July 29. In order to rescue the Korean People's Army fighters who were gloriously wounded in the national liberation war, the medical team members displayed a noble spirit of internationalism and selflessly carried out medical work. In the past two months, more than 130 Korean People's Army fighters have been treated by them and returned to the front lines. Their warm and friendly assistance has greatly encouraged the fighting enthusiasm of the Korean People's Army fighters. In addition, the Hungarian working people have also enthusiastically launched a campaign to donate comfort bags. The Peace Committee of the Rakosi Factory in Budapest customized 10,000 comfort bags in a few days, the transport workers customized 5,000, and the workers of the "Ganz" Electric Factory customized 4,000. The "Free Korea" team of the factory also exceeded the production plan by 60 percent and created four production innovations. In a letter to the "Free People" newspaper, they said: "The Korean fighters who are fighting against the imperialist army on the distant front are fighting with even more vigorous morale, because they know that the upright people of the world who love peace and freedom are standing with them."

As of October 5, the Polish working people had donated more than 243 million zlotys (equivalent to more than US$600,000) to purchase goods for the Korean people who were bombed by the U.S. Air Force. The Romanian working people have also raised more than 77 million lei (equivalent to more than US$48,000), which has been used to purchase goods brought to Pyongyang by the Romanian Trade Union delegation on September 2. The Executive Committee of the Democratic Women's League of the German Democratic Republic, based on the requests of many people, also decided to provide medical equipment to the Korean Red Cross to assist the heroic Korean people.

The enthusiastic support of the working people of the Southeast European people's democracies for the Korean people has inspired and strengthened the Korean people's confidence in fighting against the aggression of U.S. imperialism. (Attached picture)

    美帝国主义在朝鲜进行的罪恶的侵略战争，已激起了全世界爱好和平人民的无边愤怒与痛恨。东南欧各人民民主国家的劳动人民，对于美帝国主义这种穷凶极恶的破坏世界和平的罪行，表示了坚决的抗议与强烈的愤恨。他们不但在自己的工作岗位上加紧生产，以加强保卫世界和平的力量，并且还以实际的物质援助支援英勇斗争的朝鲜人民。
    由匈牙利劳动人民自愿捐款购置医药器材，并由匈牙利医务人员自动组成的匈牙利人民医疗队于七月二十九日抵达平壤。为了救护在民族解放战争中光荣负伤的朝鲜人民军战士，医疗队队员们发挥了崇高的国际主义精神，忘我地进行医疗工作。两个月来，经他们治愈后重上前线的朝鲜人民军战士已达一百三十余名。他们友谊的热诚帮助，大大地鼓舞了朝鲜人民军战士的战斗热情。除此以外，匈牙利劳动人民还热烈地展开了捐送慰劳袋的运动。布达佩斯拉科西工厂的和平委员会在几天之内就定制了一万个慰劳袋，运输工人定制了五千个，“干兹”电机工厂的工人定制了四千个，该厂的“自由朝鲜”小组还超过了生产计划百分之六十，创造了四项生产上的革新。他们在写给“自由人民”报的信里说：“在遥远的前线上和帝国主义军队作战的朝鲜战士们，正以更旺盛的士气进行战斗，因为他们晓得，和他们站在一起的有全世界爱好和平、自由的正直的人民。”
    波兰劳动人民为购置物品捐送遭受美国空军轰炸的朝鲜人民的款项，截止十月五日为止，已达二亿四千三百余万兹罗提（约合美金六十万元余）。罗马尼亚劳动人民也已经募集了七千七百余万列依（约合美金四万八千余元），这一笔款项业已购成实物由罗马尼亚职工会代表团于九月二日带抵平壤。德意志民主共和国民主妇联执行委员会，根据许多群众的要求，也决定以医药设备供给朝鲜红十字会，援助英勇的朝鲜人民。
