　　Beijing Postal Administration Accepts Criticism and Improves Work

To the Editor:
    After the People's Garden published Comrade Shi Baoshan's letter criticizing the eleven-day delay in transit of three ordinary letters mailed to Zhuoxian, we investigated the cause of the delay. It was due to the fact that the Zhuoxian sorting compartment was next to the Yantai sorting compartment, and the handler mistakenly placed the letters for Zhuoxian into the Yantai compartment. The General Mail Section not only conducted a thorough review of this matter, but is also studying how to rearrange the scientifically unsound sorting compartments that have been in use for many years, by allocating compartments according to railway line sections, to make the arrangement of the sorting compartments more reasonable, in order to reduce errors.

　　北京邮政管理局接受批评改进工作编者同志：
    人民园地刊登了史宝山同志关于寄往涿县的三封平信在途中耽搁了十一天的批评信后，我们曾检查了延误的原因，是由于涿县的分信格紧邻烟台的分信格，经手人误将去涿县平信置入去烟台分信格内。平常邮件股不但对这件事作了深刻的检讨，并且正研究把多年来留存下来的排列不科学的分信格，改按铁路线分段配格，使分信格的排列趋于合理，用以减少差错。
