　　Defend Peace, Intensify the Struggle
    Situ Meitang

    Over the past year, the worldwide movement to defend peace and oppose imperialist wars of aggression has formed an overwhelming mass force that cannot be resisted. Over four hundred million people have solemnly signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal, using unparalleled indignation to denounce the warmongers of Wall Street and oppose the bestial slaughter of the imperialists headed by the United States!

    The forces of peace are consolidating and growing stronger day by day. Hundreds of millions of fists are pointing at the noses of the imperialists, causing them to change from rage to trembling. In the competition between the two systems, imperialism will inevitably be submerged in the angry waves of the peaceful people. Facts show that we have enough confidence and strength to completely shatter all the evil plans of the instigators of new wars. We need a peaceful environment to build a new democratic nation, implement land reform, and pave the way for the industrialization of China, enabling the Chinese people, who have been poor and backward for thousands of years, to live a prosperous life. As for the socialist Soviet Union—the bastion of peace and democracy—it will build the world's largest hydroelectric power station on the Volga River, turning deserts into fertile fields and propelling the Soviet Union forward towards a communist society!

    Why should we want war?

    Oppose war!

    We must not forget for a moment that aggression is the nature of imperialism. Looking at the recent situation, this cruel and unscrupulous fellow is becoming increasingly frantic. To guard against its madness, we have only one path: to intensify our preparations for struggle. Therefore, defending peace and striving for peace are not empty words or playing with the term "peace," nor does it mean accepting the status quo. It does not mean delaying our fight for people's democracy, nor does it mean being "polite" to imperialism, refraining from provoking it, or exchanging servitude for "peace." No. We do not want war, but if madmen come to make trouble, we must prepare enough sacks and ropes to bind them—only in this way can we achieve genuine peace. We cannot ignore the invasion and massacre of our Korean neighbors. If the American imperialists dare to invade Taiwan and bomb the Northeast, we must rise up to defend the sacred and inviolable borders of our motherland and strike the invaders with a hundredfold force!

    Long live the victory of the struggle to defend world peace!
    Long live the Soviet Union, the leader of the world peace cause!
    Down with American imperialism!

　　保卫和平，加紧斗争
    司徒美堂
    一年来，全世界保卫和平反对帝国主义侵略战争的运动，是形成了一股沛然莫之能御的群众力量了。在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上，已有四亿人民庄严地签上了名，用无比的激愤，斥责华尔街的战贩，反对以美国为首的帝国主义者的兽性残杀！
    和平力量一天天在巩固和增长，亿万个拳头指着帝国主义者的鼻子，它是由暴跳如雷转为发抖了。两个制度的竞赛，它必将淹没在和平人民的怒浪中。事实说明，我们有足够信心和力量，完全击破新战争挑拨者的一切罪恶计划。我们需要在和平环境里建设新民主主义新国家，实行土地改革，为工业化中国开辟道路。使贫困落后了几千年的中国人民过丰裕生活；至于社会主义苏联——她是和平民主的堡垒——则要在伏尔加河建设世界上最大的水力发电站，使沙漠变成良田，把苏联推向共产主义社会前进！
    我们为什么要战争呢？
    反对战争！
    不应一刻忘记：侵略是帝国主义的本性，看近来情势，这个残忍无良的家伙是越来越疯狂了，提防它的发疯，我们只有加紧准备斗争的一途，所以保卫和平，争取和平，并不是空空洞洞的词藻，玩弄“和平”字眼，并不是说承认世界现状。并不是要拖延我们争取人民民主的战斗，并不是要跟帝国主义“讲客气”，不要刺激它，以奴役换取“和平”。不是的。我们不要战争，但如果有疯子来捣乱，我们必需准备足够捆绑疯子的麻袋和绳索。——这样来求得不折不扣的和平。对于朝鲜邻邦的被侵扰，被屠杀，我们不能置之不顾，对于美帝的胆敢侵略台湾，轰炸东北，我们必须起来捍卫神圣不可侵犯的祖国边疆，予打击者以百倍痛击！
    保卫世界和平斗争的胜利万岁！
    世界和平事业的领导者苏联万岁！
    打倒美帝国主义！
