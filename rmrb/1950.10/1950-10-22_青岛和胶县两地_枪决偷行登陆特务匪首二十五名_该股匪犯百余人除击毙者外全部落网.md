Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 21st — Guo Limao, "Major General and Commander of the First Column of the Shandong Regional People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army" and concurrently "Head of the Qingdao Suburban Mobile Group," Jiang Zhenyu, "Major General and Deputy Commander of the Second Column," Gao Shifa, "Colonel and Chief of Staff of the Second Column," and Tang Xiuyun, "Major of the Qingdao Suburban Mobile Group" and other ringleaders, a total of twenty-five espionage agents belonging to the bandit "Bureau of Confidentiality," who sneaked ashore on the coast of Dazhu Mountain in the southern part of the Jiaodong Peninsula in May of this year and were captured by our coastal defense forces, were interrogated for several months and, after being reported to and approved by the Shandong Provincial People's Government, were executed by firing squad in Qingdao and Jiaoxian on the 12th and 15th of this month, respectively. The remaining captured bandits have been prosecuted by the public security organs to the people's courts and sentenced accordingly.

　　This armed espionage group, totaling 104 people, was composed of bandit gang spies selected from the bandit "Bureau of Confidentiality" who fled from the mainland to Taiwan and from the bandit army, and had undergone several months of training. The armed espionage group planned to sneak ashore in Jiaonan and then disperse and lurk in the mountainous areas of Qingdao, Jimo, Laoshan, Jiaoxian, and Zhaoyuan, recruiting stray bandits, and engaging in counter-revolutionary sabotage activities such as blasting, assassinations, looting grain depots, spying on intelligence, and manufacturing counterfeit money in a decentralized and concentrated, irregular manner.

　　Before the bandits landed, they had sent Tang Xiuyun and others to sneak back to Qingdao and Shanghai to establish latent groups, arrange contact points, and select landing sites to coordinate the landing of batches of spies.

　　Since its formation, this armed espionage group had repeatedly sought opportunities to land in our coastal area of Qingdao, but all attempts were unsuccessful due to our strict coastal defense. During this period, the bandits robbed merchant ships, fishing boats, and civilian ships more than thirty times in the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea. This May, when our People's Liberation Army marched into Zhoushan, the bandits took the opportunity to sneak ashore east of Dazhu Mountain in Jiaonan on May 14th under the cover of the two bandit ships "Jingzhong No. 1" and "Jingzhong No. 2." However, this was immediately discovered by us. Our coastal defense forces and public security forces, in coordination with the militia, quickly surrounded and annihilated them. All but those killed among the 104 bandits were captured. At the same time, their on-shore latent organization was also completely destroyed. Our army seized four American-style light machine guns, seventeen American-style submachine guns, eighty-four carbines, rifles, etc., three radio stations, as well as codes, secret documents, certificates, counterfeit RMB, ammunition, and many other materials.

　　青岛和胶县两地
    枪决偷行登陆特务匪首二十五名
    该股匪犯百余人除击毙者外全部落网
    【新华社青岛二十一日电】今年五月间在胶东半岛南部大珠山海岸偷行登陆、被我海防部队俘获的匪“保密局”特务机关所属“山东地区人民反共救国军第一纵队少将纵队长”兼“青岛郊区流动组组长”郭立茂、“第二纵队少将副纵队长”江振钰、“第二纵队上校参谋长”高世发及“青岛郊区流动组少校联络员”唐岫云等首犯二十五名，经数月的审讯，并呈报山东省人民政府批准后，已于本月十二、十五两日分别在青岛和胶县两地枪决。所俘获的其余匪犯，已由公安机关向人民法院提出公诉，分别判处。
    该股武装特务共一百零四人，系匪“保密局”自大陆逃窜到台湾之匪帮特务和匪军中选拔组成者，并经过数月之训练。该股武装特务计划在胶南偷行登陆后，分散潜往青岛、即墨、崂山、胶县、招远等地山区，网罗流散匪徒，以分散和集中等不定活动方式，进行爆破、暗杀、抢劫粮库、刺探情报、制造伪钞等反革命破坏活动。
    匪等登陆前，曾派遣唐犯岫云等潜回青岛、上海建立潜伏组，布置联络据点，选择登陆地址，以策应成批特务登陆。
    该股特务武装自组成后，曾数度在我青岛沿海一带伺机登陆，因我海防严密，均未得逞。在此期间，匪等曾在东海、黄海海面抢劫商船、渔船、民船等三十余次。今年五月当我人民解放军进军舟山之际，该股匪徒乃乘机由“精忠一号”、“精忠二号”两匪艇掩护，于五月十四日在胶南大珠山以东海岸偷行登陆。但此事当即被我发现。我海防部队、公安部队协同民兵武装随即迅速将其包围聚歼。匪众一百零四人除击毙者外，余均俘获。同时，其岸上之潜伏组织亦被全部破获。我军共缴获美式轻机枪四挺、美式冲锋枪十七枝、卡宾枪、步枪等八十四枝、电台三部以及密码、密件、证件、伪人民币、弹药及物资等甚多。
