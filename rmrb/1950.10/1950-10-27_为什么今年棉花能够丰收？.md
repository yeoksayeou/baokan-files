　　Why Did This Year's Cotton Harvest Succeed?
　　Hua Shu

　　I

　　On February 27th of this year, the Central Ministry of Agriculture issued instructions regarding agricultural production guidelines and grain and cotton increase plans for 1950. It was clearly stated that the central task of agricultural production in 1950 was to increase the production of grain and cotton. Specifically, for cotton, the requirement was to increase the production of ginned cotton by 4.77 million dan on the existing level, meaning a total of 50 million mu of cotton should be planted this year, producing 13.28 million dan of ginned cotton.

　　According to the comprehensive news recently published in the People's Daily, this year's ginned cotton production is estimated at over 14 million dan, an increase of 5.2 million dan compared to last year, exceeding the average annual production of the five years before the war (1933-37) by 20 percent, reaching 82.8 percent of the highest annual production before the war. This means that the actual increase in cotton production this year has exceeded the original central plan by more than 700,000 dan. The specific details of the excess, broken down by major administrative region, are as follows: (Unit: 10,000 dan)

　　Region	Original Planned Output by the Central Government	Estimated Actual Output of Each Region
　　Northeast Region	82.50	120.00
　　North China Region	500.40	516.81
　　Northwest Region	118.80	104.94
　　Central South Region	246.90	261.54
　　Southwest Region	——	38.61
　　East China Region	379.80	380.00
　　Total	1,328.40	1,421.90

　　The figures above are based on statistics from September. Now, the cotton harvest is nearing its end, and no irresistible disasters have occurred during this period to affect the cotton harvest. Therefore, the cotton production this year, estimated at over 14 million dan, is generally accurate.

　　When cotton was about to be sown this year, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a call to aid 100,000 unemployed workers in Shanghai. Why were they unemployed? One of the main reasons was the lack of raw cotton for the cotton mills. Mills that were originally operating day and night gradually reduced their operations to four days and five nights a week, three days and four nights, and some individual mills even temporarily shut down. This situation was not unique to Shanghai; similar situations existed to varying degrees throughout the country. It is estimated that China currently has approximately 5.2 million spindles, but the actual number in operation is only about 4.3 million. Each spindle, on average, uses about 250 jin of cotton per year, based on a two-shift system, meaning 4 million spindles require 10 million dan of raw cotton. However, last year's total cotton production was only 9 million dan, and after deducting about 40 percent for civilian cottage spinning and wadding, the quantity was even more insufficient. Originally, China's cotton textile industry had relied on imports for raw cotton for many years. After the liberation of the country, the imperialists were expelled from China, and we could no longer spend large amounts of foreign exchange to import raw cotton like before. We must accelerate the increase in cotton production and strongly support the national textile industry. The Common Program clearly stipulates that we must strive to restore and exceed the pre-war level of industrial raw material production in a short period.

　　The plan put forward by the Central Government this year to increase national cotton production to 13 million dan was indeed a very high target at the time. This was because, first, last year's floods caused great losses in major cotton-producing areas such as Hebei, Pingyuan, and northern Jiangsu. In some areas, when cotton was about to be sown this year, they were still mobilizing production to provide disaster relief. For example, in northern Jiangsu, when the East China Region was arranging the task of planting 3.5 million mu of cotton in northern Jiangsu this year, it was still rushing to allocate 75 million jin of grain for work relief, actively carrying out projects such as guiding the Yi and rectifying the Shu, and repairing the Grand Canal embankment. At that time, everyone was worried about completing the arduous task of northern Jiangsu.

　　Secondly, under the Kuomintang bandits' bone-scraping exploitation and destruction, cotton production had declined year after year. Taking the past three years as an example, the production in 1947 was 11 million dan, which fell to 10 million dan in 1948, and further dropped to 9 million dan in 1949. Even based on the average annual production of the five years before the war (1933-37), it was only 12 million dan. Now, immediately after war and famine, raising production to 13 million dan in one go is indeed a heavy responsibility.

　　Moreover, cotton is a crop that requires the most intensive cultivation, high labor consumption, and low yields. In terms of the average labor required for cotton cultivation nationwide, managing one mu of cotton field, from land preparation and sowing to flower picking (excluding ginning and processing), generally requires 12 labor days (referring to full labor). Each mu of cotton field can produce an average of 70 to 80 jin of seed cotton, equivalent to about 26 jin of ginned cotton. Taking the initially planned production of 1.3 billion jin of ginned cotton this year as an example, it would require planting more than 50 million mu of cotton fields, investing more than 600 million labor days. Based on the entire cotton cultivation period of 180 days, it would require 33 to 34 million young and strong laboring farmers to tend to the fields from early April to the end of October, requiring favorable weather and no major disasters. Therefore, after a famine, to increase production by more than half in such a planned manner within a year, and ultimately not only successfully complete the task but also exceed it, is unprecedented in Chinese history.

　　II

　　Under the reasonable production relations of the new society, the large-scale increase in cotton production is not a strange phenomenon. It will continue to occur and continue to break through in the future. Just as under the unreasonable production relations of the old society, cotton production would gradually decrease and even go bankrupt, which is also not a strange thing.

　　Why did cotton production decline in the old society? Specifically, first, due to the historical large-scale influx of foreign cotton (mainly American cotton), the domestic raw cotton market had always been controlled by imperialism. For example, in 1946, more than 6.9 million dan of foreign cotton were imported along with American aid supplies. The raw cotton supply of cotton mills across the country, especially those in Shanghai and Wuxi, which accounted for nearly three-quarters of the country's spindles, was almost entirely controlled by foreign merchants, leaving no room for domestic cotton.

　　Second, due to the cruel exploitation of bureaucratic capital, carrying out unequal exchanges in an official and commercial manner, cotton farmers were eventually forced to abandon cotton fields and no longer plant cotton. For example, the "Agricultural Capital Bureau," one of the blood-sucking pipes of the four major families, during the Anti-Japanese War, in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi, one of the few high-quality cotton-producing areas in the country, forcibly implemented price-limited purchases at prices less than half of the actual production cost, monopolizing the cotton market. As a result, in less than five years, the cotton planting area in Shaanxi sharply decreased by 65 percent.

　　Third, under the economic aggression of imperialism and the layers of exploitation by bureaucratic capital, coupled with the ruthless oppression of the landlord class and the Kuomintang government's fundamental neglect or even intentional destruction of water conservancy construction, for example, in northern Jiangsu, in the Yellow River flooded area, on the shores of Dongting Lake, and in the central Hubei cotton-producing area, thousands of mu of cotton fields were often flooded. Some were fortunate enough to be sown in early summer, but were submerged by floods during flowering and boll formation. Some managed to survive the flood season and even picked some white cotton, but the exorbitant rents, taxes, and high-interest loans had already made cotton farmers breathless! What was there to talk about increasing production?

　　Why can cotton production increase greatly in the new society?

　　Specifically: First, the basic victory of the People's Liberation War, war service has been lifted in most areas, land reform and mutual aid work teams in the old areas, and rent reduction and rent refunds in the new areas have universally increased the masses' production enthusiasm and production capacity.

　　Second, the correctness of leadership policies. The formulation of the 1950 cotton production increase plan was initially based on the feedback from grassroots situations. After careful research and discussion at the National Agricultural Production Conference held last December, people's governments at all levels convened a series of related meetings (such as economic conferences, people's congresses, labor model conferences, cotton farmer conferences, etc.) and formulated implementation methods suitable for local conditions based on the central government's plan guidelines to ensure the implementation of the tasks.

　　Third, the success of last year's cotton purchase policy. After the autumn harvest last year, under the unified leadership of the central government, flower and cloth companies (or trade companies acting on their behalf where there are no flower and cloth companies) universally established cotton collection stations in large and small distribution markets in cotton-producing areas across the country, directly purchasing raw cotton according to the reasonable price ratio stipulated by the people's government. This avoided the speculative exploitation of middlemen and the various losses caused by competition or monopoly when various cotton mills independently collected cotton in the past, thereby increasing the farmers' confidence in responding to the government's call to plant more cotton.

　　Fourth, the guarantee of reasonable price ratios this year: Before cotton was sown this spring, the Central Finance and Economics Committee issued a notice on the national cotton-grain price ratio, stipulating that each jin of medium-grade ginned cotton could be exchanged for 8 jin of millet in North China and Shandong, 7 jin of wheat in Henan and Shaanxi, and 6.5 jin of rice in the Yangtze River Basin (Note: there were subsequent increases). This was a safe and powerful guarantee put forward to encourage cotton farmers to boldly plant cotton. Moreover, supply and marketing cooperatives and flower and cloth companies in the Northeast Region and parts of Hebei and Pingyuan provinces even signed contracts with cotton farmers in advance, guaranteeing that if the cotton price rose, the cotton would be collected at the increased price, and if the cotton price fell, it would be purchased at the price ratio. As a result, the masses in Shanxi reflected: "The contract is set in the spring and the cotton is harvested in the autumn, see if I will plant cotton!"

　　Fifth, people's governments at all levels vigorously prevented floods and flood control, thus ensuring a bumper cotton harvest. Here we take northern Jiangsu as an example again. Starting in August this year, the canal flood control work in the lower reaches of the Huai River in northern Jiangsu mobilized more than 300,000 people along both sides of the river, including more than ten counties such as Baoying and Gaoyou, to guard day and night. Thanks to their efforts, the 3.7 million mu of cotton fields were able to have a bumper harvest. Other areas such as the Jingzhou and Shashi cotton-producing area and the eastern Zhejiang cotton-producing area were also able to avoid disasters because of effective flood control. On the other hand, this year the government allocated more than 1 billion jin of millet for water conservancy construction projects, of which 19 percent was used for canal irrigation fees, which also provided a strong guarantee for this year's task of increasing cotton and grain production.

　　Sixth, the method of allowing cotton to be used as payment for public grain announced by the people's government reduced cotton farmers' concerns, thus expanding the cotton fields. Because the proportion of food crop cultivation is very low in the larger cotton-producing areas, in the past, cotton farmers had to sell cotton in order to pay public grain, thus wasting work and time; or suffering losses from the unequal exchange of middlemen. Therefore, within the scope of each small-scale farmer's operation, they always had to leave a gap of land, taking into account food and increasing many agricultural troubles. After cotton could be used as payment for public grain, this concern was also eliminated.

　　Seventh, the strong support of the state's material strength. This year, the investment in increasing cotton production nationwide totaled more than 60 million jin of rice, which was used to build cotton farms, ginning farms, purchase agricultural machinery and medicines, and regulate cotton seeds and fertilizers. In addition, supply and marketing cooperatives and banks in various places have also prepared and loaned seeds, fertilizers, livestock, and agricultural tools. Especially in terms of seeds, it was considered last winter that some disaster areas and areas with larger cotton field expansion had insufficient seeds or needed to breed and replace good varieties. Therefore, preparations were relatively sufficient. In total, more than 78 million jin of high-quality cotton seeds were organized and regulated nationwide, solving the problem of seed shortage for 6 to 7 million mu of cotton fields, and laying a solid foundation for this year's cotton increase work.

　　Eighth, people's government cadres at all levels fully attach importance to cotton planting work. When cotton was sown, they treated it as an overriding task. For example, Hebei Province mobilized more than 15,000 cadres to participate in a concentrated cotton planting campaign. For example, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Central South Region and the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Hubei Province organized a cotton planting work team of more than 70 technical cadres to go to various places to guide promotion. For example, county-level cadres in parts of Shandong in North China intensified their technical studies before going to the countryside to guide cotton planting, and even held exams to check. After going to the countryside, they also used telephones to gather information and exchange experiences. Many areas established cotton planting headquarters or joint offices at that time. And local newspapers also cooperated with cotton planting, focusing on reports and vigorously promoting it. As for labor models and production experts, they were even more excited: making plans, issuing challenges, writing to Chairman Mao to make guarantees... forming an unprecedented new atmosphere of taking planting more cotton as an honor. Taking this National Labor Model Conference as an example, among the agricultural labor model representatives attending the meeting, such as Zhao Qizhi, Zhang Fuling, Tong Xiangchen, Huang Xieyang, Yang Xiqing, Cheng Guangmin, Yang Tiancai... all were model cotton farmers or cadres who were elected by the masses because of their excellent cotton planting technology or successful promotion of cotton planting.

　　Ninth, various places have vigorously launched intensive farming and fertilization campaigns. Cotton is originally a crop of intensive management; the requirements for "fine cultivation" are the highest. According to the feedback from various places, this year generally four to seven times of inter-tillage have been achieved, and the average amount of fertilization has also increased by half compared to last year. Due to the improvement of the masses' awareness, the research and improvement in cultivation technology have also gradually deepened. For example, the Gao Guandou mutual aid group, a labor model in Hebei Province, invented a method of long-lasting irrigation efficiency in summer. The Yang Bazi cotton planting technology group, a labor model in Anguo County, automatically went to the downtown area to prepare insecticides during the period when cotton insects were rampant, and encouraged everyone to learn. Furthermore, some women in the cotton-producing area had no habit of working in the fields, but due to the influence of the leading role of female youth league members and labor models, women went to the fields to weed, control insects, fertilize, and pick cotton... which has formed a mass action. As for schools and groups in various places, especially the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, during the cotton sowing, cotton field insect control, summer drought prevention, and cotton harvest periods, some used their holidays, and some officially took a few days off to assist cotton farmers and strive not to miss the farming season free of charge, which is even more inseparable from the victory of this year's cotton increase work.

　　Tenth, and finally must be mentioned, since the beginning of spring this year, timely general rain has fallen in various places across the country, especially in the major cotton-producing areas, which first created favorable conditions for cotton field sowing, saving labor and ensuring seedling emergence, and further encouraging the masses to actively expand cotton planting emotions.

　　Due to the above ten items and other reasons that are not fully included, this year, in the vast fields of the new China, there can be more than 50 million mu of cotton fields, blooming with flowers and full of "peaches."

　　III

　　Although we already have an annual output of 14 million dan of cotton, and although we have initially achieved the self-sufficiency of raw cotton for 4 million spindles, however, with the continuous improvement of people's living standards, this production figure still has a gap with the actual demand in the future.

　　Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi mentioned the supply of cotton cloth in the Northeast in recent years in his speech on the eve of May Day. He said: "The number of cloths sold in the Northeast in 1947 was 800,000 pieces, 1.2 million pieces in 1948, 3.2 million pieces in 1949, and it is estimated that it may reach 9 million pieces in 1950." With the increase in rural purchasing power, the demand for cotton cloth in various parts of the country in the future, although it may not increase as rapidly as in the Northeast, will also increase greatly, which is beyond doubt.

　　According to past records, the raw cotton required for textile a piece of cotton cloth is 12 jin (calculated by 12 pounds of cloth). Since liberation, thanks to the efforts of the working class and the success of the policy of simplification and economy, it has been saved to less than 11 and a half jin. Calculated by 11 and a half jin, the raw cotton required for the 9 million pieces of cloth in the Northeast this year will be more than 1 million dan. The population of the Northeast accounts for about one-twelfth of the total population of the country. If calculated at the same demand, the national demand is more than 12 million dan for textile cotton alone. What's more, there are other cotton used for wadding, medical cotton, chemical medicine, national defense and military cotton, etc. According to general estimates, the current total demand for ginned cotton nationwide is more than 18 million dan, of course, excluding the export cotton used to exchange for industrial construction materials.

　　To complete the self-sufficiency of domestic cotton and strive for the possibility of surplus, judging from the speed and effectiveness of cotton production increase this year, its prospects are infinitely optimistic. The main thing here is the increase in yield per unit area.

　　The average yield per mu of cotton fields nationwide this year is only 26 jin of ginned cotton, so only 14 million dan of production is achieved after planting 50 to 60 million mu. But as long as each mu can increase by another jin, the total output can be increased by 500,000 to 600,000 dan, and this efficiency is amazing enough. And this possibility is entirely possible.

　　Speaking of increasing yield, there are many methods, but the only important thing is to promote good varieties, because the area currently cultivated with good varieties is only 10 million mu. This year, the average yield per mu of cultivated good varieties in the cotton-producing areas in China, such as Shandong, can reach 40 jin of ginned cotton, Henan can reach 35 jin, and other places are at least 30 jin or more. As for individual examples, in the past, the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Jingzhou and Shashi areas of central Hubei had records of reaching 100 jin to 150 jin, and North China and Shaanxi had even better results, exceeding 200 jin.

　　In the Soviet Union, according to the Socialist Agriculture newspaper in July this year: The Voroshilov Collective Farm in the Azerbaijan Republic produced 111.2 quintals of cotton per hectare on 5 hectares of cultivated land in 1947, which is equivalent to 1,483 jin of cotton per mu. Of course, this refers to seed cotton. At a ratio of 1 to 3 to converted to ginned cotton, it is nearly 500 jin.

　　Although outstanding examples cannot be compared with general situations, but from the possibility of increasing the current yield of 26 jin per mu to 30 or 40 jin, based on the records of 100 to 200 jin or even 500 jin per mu, the prospect of increasing cotton production in our country will be infinitely beautiful.

　　为什么今年棉花能够丰收？
    华  恕
    一
    今年二月二十七日，中央农业部发布了关于一九五○年农业生产方针及粮棉增产计划的指示。明确提出：一九五○年农业生产的中心是增产粮食和棉花。对于棉花，具体要求在现有水平上，增产皮棉四百七十七万担，即今年共须植棉五千万亩，产皮棉一三二八万担。
    根据最近人民日报所发表的综合消息，今年皮棉约产一千四百余万担，比去年增产五百二十万担，超过战前五年（一九三三——三七）平均年产量百分之二十，达战前最高年产量的百分之八十二点八。即今年棉花实际的增产已超出中央原定计划七十多万担。其超出的具体情况，以各大行政区为单位，有如下表：（单位：万担）
    区别      中央原计划产量              各区实际能完成产量
    东北区    八二·五○                    一二○·○○
    华北区    五○○·四○                  五一六·八一
    西北区    一一八·八○                  一○四·九四
    中南区    二四六·九○                  二六一·五四
    西南区    ——                          三八·六一
    华东区    三七九·八○                  三八○·○○
    共计      一，三二八·四○              一，四二一·九○
    上表数字，系九月间的统计，现在，棉收已近尾声，而这期间并未发生不可抗拒的灾害来影响棉花的收成。因此今年的棉花产量，以一千四百余万担计算大体上是正确的。
    今年棉花刚要下种的时候，中华全国总工会曾发出援助上海十万失业工人的号召；怎么会失业的呢？主要理由之一，是由于纱厂缺乏原棉。本来日夜开工的，后来逐渐降低到一星期开工四日五夜，三日四夜，甚至个别纱厂，因而暂时停工。而这情形，不仅上海一地为然，在全国各地都有不同程度的类似情形。据估计，我国现有纱锭，共约五百二十万枚，但实际开工数，则仅约四百三十万枚，每枚纱锭平均全年用棉量，以日夜两班制计算约为二百五十斤，四百万枚，即需供应原棉一千万担，然而去年全部棉花产量也不过九百万担，还要除去百分之四十上下的民间土纺与胎絮等用耗，数量上更感不敷。本来我国棉纺工业的原棉多少年来都是以进口为主，全国解放后，帝国主义被驱逐出中国，我们不能再像以前那样耗费大量外汇，输进原棉，我们必须加速地增产棉花，大力地支持民族纺织工业，共同纲领曾明确地规定：要争取在短期内恢复并超过战前的工业原料的生产水平。
    今年中央所提出的那个全国棉花增产到一三○○万担的计划数字，在当时确是很高的目标。这是因为第一：由于去年的水灾使主要棉产区如河北、平原、苏北等地，都受了很大的损失，个别地区，当今年棉花快要下种的时候，还在动员生产救灾，比如苏北，华东区在布置今年苏北植棉三百五十万亩的任务时，还正在赶拨七千五百万斤粮食，以工代赈，积极办理导沂整沭和培修运河堤防的工程，那时大家都为完成苏北的艰巨任务而担心。
    其次，在蒋匪敲骨吸髓的剥削破坏下，棉花历年减产，以近三年为例，一九四七年产量为一千一百万担，一九四八年跌至一千万担，一九四九年又跌至九百万担，即以抗战前五年（一九三三——三七）的平均年产量计，也不过一千二百万担。现在我们紧接着战争与灾荒之后，要一口气提高到一千三百万担，责任实在是够重的。
    还有，棉花是一种最需要精耕细作的庄稼，耗工大，产量低，以全国棉作栽培的平均需工量来说，经营一亩棉田，从整地下种到收花（轧花加工还不在内）一般得十二个工（指全劳动力），每亩棉田，平均可摘籽花七八十斤，即皮花二十六斤左右，就拿今年最初计划的生产十三亿斤皮花来说，也得要栽满五千多万亩棉田，投下六万万多个人工，又以整个棉作栽培时间的一百八十天计算，便需要三千三四百万个年轻力壮的劳动农民，朝朝暮暮地从四月初起一直侍弄到十月底，还要风调雨顺，不闹大灾害。因此在灾荒之后，一年之内，这样有计划地提高产量超过半数以上，而最后不但胜利地完成了任务，并且还超额地完成了任务，这是中国历史上所空前未有的。
    二
    在新社会的合理生产关系下，棉花之能够大量增产，并不是什么奇怪的现象，以后还要继续出现并继续突破。这正如在旧社会不合理生产关系下，棉花要日益减产，乃至破产，同样并不是什么奇怪的事情。
    为什么在旧社会下，棉花要日益减产呢？具体地说，第一，由于洋棉（主要的是美棉）的历史性地大量入超，国内原棉市场，一直被操纵在帝国主义手里。如以一九四六年为例：那年随着美帝救济物资而一齐输入了六百九十多万担洋棉，全国纱厂特别是占全国纱锭数近四分之三的上海无锡两地纱厂的原棉供应量，几乎完全被控制在洋商手里，而无国棉插足的余地。
    第二，由于官僚资本的残酷剥削，亦官亦商地进行不等价交换，逼得棉农最后只好让棉田废弃不再植棉，例如四大家族吸血管之一的“农本局”，于抗战时期，在国内有数的优良棉区陕西关中一带，强制以不及实际生产成本半数的价格，施行限价收买，垄断棉花市场，因此不到五年，陕西植棉面积便锐减了百分之六十五。
    第三，在帝国主义经济侵略与官僚资本的层层剥削下，还要加上地主阶级的无情压榨以及国民党政府对水利建设的根本忽视甚至有意破坏，例如在苏北，在黄泛区，在洞庭湖湖滨，在鄂中棉区等地，经常是几千几万亩的棉田被淹在水里，有的幸好初夏抢着下了种，但到开花结铃时，又被洪水没掉。有的万一汛期偷过，居然摘下一些白花，可是地租苛税与高利贷剥削已使棉农喘不过气来！还说什么增产？
    为什么在新社会下，棉花又能大大增产呢？
    具体说来：首先是人民解放战争的基本胜利，战争勤务在绝大地区已经解除，老区的土改和变工互助，新区的减租退租都使群众生产情绪和生产能力普遍高涨起来。
    其次是领导政策的正确。一九五○年棉花增产计划的拟定，最初是根据基层情况的反映，在去年十二月所召开的全国农业生产会议上，经过了缜密的研讨后，各级人民政府又召开了一系列的有关会议（如经济会议，人代会议，劳模会议，棉农会议等）依据中央的计划方针，制定了适合各地情况的实施办法，以保证贯彻任务。
    第三是去年棉花收购政策的成功，去年秋收以后，在中央统一领导下，全国各棉区内大小集散市场，都由花纱布公司（当地无花纱布公司者由贸易公司代办）普遍地设立了收花站，依照人民政府规定的合理比价，直接收购原棉，因而避免了中间商人的投机剥削和以往各纱厂单独收花时，因竞购或垄断所造成的种种损失，而提高了农民响应政府号召，多种棉花的信心。
    第四是今年合理比价的保证：今春棉花下种之前，中财委发布了全国棉粮比价的通告，规定每斤中级皮棉，在华北、山东换小米八斤，河南、陕西换小麦七斤，长江流域换大米六斤半（按：以后又有提高）这是为了鼓励棉农大胆植棉，而提出的安全有力的保障。而东北区，以及河北、平原等省部分地区的供销社、花纱布公司，更与棉农预先订定合同，担保棉价涨了，按涨价收花，棉价跌了，按比价收购，因之山西群众反映说：“春定合同秋收花，看我种花不种花！”
    第五是各级人民政府大力防洪防汛，因而保障了棉花的丰收，这里我们再以苏北为例，今年苏北淮河下游的运河防汛工作，自八月份起，在沿河两岸，包括宝应、高邮等十多个县，动员了三十多万人，日夜守护，由于他们的努力，才使得那三百七十万亩棉田得以丰收，他如荆沙棉区、浙东棉区等都是因为防汛得力，棉区才能避免灾害的，另一方面，今年政府拨发水利建设事业费十亿余斤小米，其中百分之十九用为开渠灌溉费，也给今年增产棉粮的任务以有力的保证。
    第六是由于人民政府颁布了棉花可以代缴公粮的办法，减少棉农的顾虑，因而扩展了棉田。因为在较大的棉区内，粮食作物栽培的比例很低，以往棉农为了要缴纳公粮，不得已将棉花出售，因而误工费时；或者受到中间商人不等价交换的损失，所以在各个小农经营的范围内，总还要留出一隙之地，兼顾粮食而增加许多农事上的麻烦，自棉花可代缴公粮后，这一层顾虑也被打消了。
    第七是国家物资力量的大力支持，今年全国棉花增产的投资，共用米达六千余万斤，用以建设棉场，轧花场，购买农用药械及调剂棉种、肥料。此外，各地供销社，银行也都进行了准备与贷售种籽、肥料、牲畜及农具等工作。特别在种籽方面，去年冬天即考虑到部分灾区及棉田扩展较大地区的种籽不足，或需要繁殖与更换良种，因而准备得比较充分，总计全国有组织地调剂了七万八千多万斤优良棉种，解决了六、七百万亩棉田的缺种问题，而为今年的棉增工作，打下了巩固的基础。
    第八，人民政府各级干部对植棉工作的充分重视，当棉花播种的时候，都把它当作压倒一切的任务，如河北省曾动员一万五千余干部，投入突击植棉运动，如中南区农林部及湖北省农林厅，曾组织七十余技术干部之植棉工作队，分赴各地指导推广，如华北山东部分专区县级干部，在下乡指导植棉之前，都加紧学习技术，甚至还举行考试检查。下乡后又利用电话汇集情况，交流经验。不少地区在当时都成立了植棉指挥部或联合办公室。而各地报纸，也都配合植棉，重点报导，大力鼓动，至于劳动模范和生产能手们，更是兴高采烈：订计划，下挑战书，上书毛主席提出保证，……形成了一种空前的以多种棉花为光荣的新风气。就拿这次全国劳模会议来说，在出席会议的农业劳模代表中，如赵启志、张福龄、佟相臣、黄燮阳、杨锡庆、程光敏、杨天才……全是以植棉技术优良，或推广植棉成功而被群众推选出来的模范棉农或干部。
    第九，各地都大力开展了精耕细作和多施肥料的运动，棉花原是一种集约经营的作物；对“细作”的要求最高，据各地情况的反映，今年一般地都做到了中耕四次至七次，施肥量平均也比去年增加一半，由于群众觉悟程度的提高，在栽培技术上的研究和改进，也逐渐深入，如河北省劳模高贯斗互助组，发明了夏季浇水效率持久的方法，安国县劳模杨八子植棉技术小组，在棉虫猖獗时期，自动到闹市上去配制杀虫药剂，鼓动大家来学习，再如部分棉区的妇女，原无下田劳作的习惯，可是由于女青年团员和劳动模范的带头影响，妇女下田锄草、治虫、施肥、摘花……已形成一种群众性的行动，至于各地学校团体，特别是人民解放军指战员，在棉花播种、棉田治虫、夏季防旱和棉花收获期间，有的利用假期，有的正式放假几日，来协助棉农，无偿地争取不误农时，这更是与今年棉增工作的胜利不能分开的。
    第十，也是最后必须提到的，今年入春以来，全国各地尤其是各主要棉区，都及时地普降透雨，首先造成了棉田播种的有利条件，既省劳力，又保证了出苗，更鼓励了群众积极扩大植棉的情绪。
    由于以上十项以及其他尚未完全包括的理由，今年，在新中国的广大田野上，才能有五千多万亩棉田，开遍了花朵，结满了“桃子”。
    三
    虽然我们已经有了年产量一千四百万担的棉花，虽然我们已初步地达到了四百万纱锭的原棉自给，可是，在人民生活水平不断地提高中，这个生产数字，与今后的实际需要量，还是有着距离的。
    刘少奇副主席在五一前夕的演说中，曾提到近年来东北棉布的供应问题，他说：“一九四七年在东北销售的布匹是八十万匹，一九四八年是一百二十万匹，一九四九年是三百二十万匹，一九五○年预计可能达到九百万匹”。随着农村购买力的提高，今后全国各地对棉布的需要量，虽不一定会像东北增加这样迅速，但也将大大增加，是无疑问的。
    根据过去的记载，纺织一匹棉布所需的原棉是十二斤（按十二磅布计算），解放以来，由于工人阶级的努力和精简节约政策的成功，已节省到十一斤半还不到，就以十一斤半计算，则今年东北所需九百万匹布的原棉，便要一百多万担。东北人口，约占全国总人口的十二分之一，设以同等需要量计算，则仅指纺织用棉一项而言，全国所需即达原棉一千二百万担以上，何况其他还有胎絮用棉，医药用棉，化工用药，国防军事用棉等等，据一般估计，目前全国皮棉的总需要量，当在一千八百万担以上，当然其中还未包括用以交换工业建设物资的出口棉花在内。
    要完成国棉的自给自足，更进而争取出超的可能，就从今年棉花增产的速度与成效来看，其前途是无限乐观的。这里主要的就是单位面积的增产。
    今年全国棉田的每亩平均产量，还只有皮棉二十六斤，所以栽了五六千万亩，产量仍不过一千四百多万担，但只要每亩还能够增加一斤，总产量就可以提高五六十万担，这个效率是够惊人的。而这种可能又是完全存在的。
    说到提高产量，办法也很多，但唯一重要的是推广良种，因为目前良种栽培的面积，还只有一千万亩，而今年我国各棉区内栽培良种的地带，如山东每亩平均产量可达皮棉四十斤，河南可达三十五斤，其他各地也至少在三十斤以上，至于个别的例子，则过去长江下游和鄂中荆沙区，有达到过一百斤至一百五十斤的纪录，华北和陕西更有过二百斤以上的成绩。
    在苏联，据今年七月社会主义农业报所载：阿捷尔拜疆共和国伏罗希洛夫集体农场，一九四七年时，于五公顷耕地上，每公顷产棉一一一·二公担，折算起来，合每亩产棉一千四百八十三斤，当然这是指籽棉而言，以一比三算成皮棉，也将近五百斤了。
    虽则突出的例子，不能与一般情况同日而语，但从现在每亩产量二十六斤提高到三、四十斤的可能性，根据每亩可产一、二百斤甚至五百斤的纪录来推测，我国棉花增产的前途，将是无限美好的。
