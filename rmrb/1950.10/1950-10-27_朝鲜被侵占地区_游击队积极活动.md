　　Korean Occupied Areas
    Guerrilla Forces Actively Operate
    [Xinhua News Agency, 26th] A large number of Korean People's Guerrilla forces are actively attacking the enemy in the rear of the areas occupied by the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. According to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 22nd, South Korean police revealed that approximately 7,000 guerrilla troops descended from the mountains on the 22nd and attacked villages 40 miles north of the 38th parallel and 30 miles from the east coast. The dispatch quoted US intelligence officials as estimating that there are nearly 15,000 guerrillas in the Yangyang area along the main supply line to the north, and 2,000 have reached the coastal area 30 miles south of Wonsan. The dispatch also exclaimed, "Unless they are eliminated immediately, they will pose a serious threat to the rear of the South Korean Third Division and the Kyoto Division." US military advisors are also worried that they will have to "move a considerable number of troops from the front to deal with the guerrillas."
    According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 21st, about 1,000 Korean People's Guerrilla troops briefly occupied the Hwacheon Power Plant, 50 miles northeast of Seoul, on the evening of the 19th. There are also 2,000 guerrilla troops operating in the Sudong area, about 12 miles north of Hwacheon.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 26th] The Korean people's firm opposition to the American aggressors and their iron will not to yield to the enemy has been fully demonstrated by the fact that the American troops could not find any puppets after occupying Wonsan. According to a Reuters dispatch on the 20th, the so-called "Tokyo spokesman," when talking about the "some difficulties" in establishing a puppet government in the newly occupied areas, cited the example of Wonsan. The spokesman helplessly admitted, "Most of the city's leaders and lower-level officials ran away with the communist army when the South Korean army approached. In fact, there are no possible leading figures in the city." The spokesman also worried that other places would encounter such "typical examples" as Wonsan, and that they would not be able to find any puppets to drive.

　　朝鲜被侵占地区
    游击队积极活动
    【新华社二十六日讯】大量朝鲜人民游击部队在美国侵略者与李承晚匪帮侵占区的后方，积极打击敌人。据路透社东京二十二日讯：据南朝鲜警察方面透露：二十二日约有七千名游击部队从山上涌下来，袭击三八线以北四十英里、距东海岸三十英里处的村庄。该电引美国情报官员估计，在通往北方的主要供给线上的襄阳一带的游击队，将近有一万五千人，并且有二千人已进抵元山以南三十英里的海岸地区。该电同时惊呼：“除非立刻予以肃清，他们将对南朝鲜第三师与京都师的后方造成严重威胁”。美军顾问并焦虑将不得不“自前线调动相当大的部队来对付游击队”。
    另据美联社二十一日讯：朝鲜人民游击部队约一千人，十九日晚曾一度占领汉城东北五十英里的桦川发电厂。桦川以北十二英里左右的水洞地区还有两千游击部队在进行活动。
    【新华社二十六日讯】朝鲜人民坚决反对美国侵略者、决不向敌人屈膝的钢铁意志，从美军在侵占元山后找不到任何傀儡的事件中，得到了充分的证明。据路透社二十日讯：所谓“东京发言人”谈及在新侵占地区建立傀儡政府的“若干困难”时，举了元山的例子。该发言人无可奈何地承认：“该市大部分的领袖和下级官员都在南朝鲜军逼近的时候，与共军一起跑了。实际上，该市已没有任何可能的领袖人物。”该发言人并担忧在其他地方也会碰到像元山这样“典型的例子”，找不到任何可供驱策的傀儡。
