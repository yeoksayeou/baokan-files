　　Raise Vigilance, Strengthen National Defense!
    Yang Bing'an
    Korea is a brotherly country connected to us by flesh and blood. It faces our Northeast's largest power plant in Andong across the river, our steel capital Anshan across the river, our Northeast's political and industrial center Shenyang across the river, our Northeast's coal, iron ore, gold mines, forests, etc. across the river, our Northeast's boundless fertile fields across the river, and millions of our compatriots in the Northeast across the river! ... Now, fascist bandits are setting fires in Korea, the Korean war is becoming increasingly tense, and our national defense and the industrial heartland of the Northeast are feeling the threat. We, the righteous Chinese people, cannot but pay close attention to the Korean people's war of liberation and the safety of our own motherland. We cannot allow bandits to肆行invade our brother country and ignore it!
    In the past, what steps did the Japanese invaders take to invade China? Now, what steps is American imperialism taking to carry out its aggression? The US imperialism is completely following the old path of the Japanese invaders! Every Chinese people must be vigilant about this.
    In the past, the Japanese invaders annexed Korea, entered the Northeast, launched a large-scale war of aggression, and妄图attempted to destroy China. The Chinese people achieved their final victory after a long and arduous struggle. We have painful lessons, but we also have the steel-like strength forged from a long and brutal struggle. We must not hesitate to defend the fruits of victory we have won with our blood at any cost. We must be especially vigilant, strengthen our national defense, and be ready to crush the despicable aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism anytime, anywhere, and we are confident that we have the power to crush this despicable aggressive conspiracy!

　　提高警惕，加强国防！
    杨炳安
    朝鲜是和我们骨肉相连的兄弟国家。它与我们东北最大发电厂之一的所在地安东隔江相望，与我们的钢都鞍山隔江相望，与我们东北政治中心、工业中心的沈阳隔江相望，与我们东北的煤铁矿、金矿、森林等隔江相望，与我们东北一望无际的肥沃田野隔江相望，与我们东北千百万同胞隔江相望！………现在，法西斯匪徒们正在朝鲜大肆放火，朝鲜战事日趋紧张，我们的国防与工业重地的东北已感受威胁。我们，正义的中国人民，对朝鲜人民的解放战争，对我们自己祖国的安全，不能不予以密切的关怀。我们不能听任匪徒们对我们的兄弟国家肆行侵略而置之不理！
    过去，日寇是按照怎样的步骤来侵略中国的？现在，美帝国主义又是按照怎样的步骤来实行侵略的？美帝完全是走日寇的旧路！这一点，我们每一个中国人民都是必须警惕的。
    过去，日寇并吞朝鲜，进入东北，发动大规模的侵略战争，妄图灭亡中国。中国人民经过长期艰巨的斗争才得到了最后胜利，我们有着痛苦的教训，但是，我们也有着从长期惨酷斗争中所锻炼出来的钢铁般的力量。我们必须不惜以任何代价来保卫我们用鲜血所换得的胜利果实。我们必须特别提高警惕，加强国防，随时随地准备去粉碎美帝国主义卑鄙的侵略阴谋，而且我们自信有力量能够粉碎这个卑鄙的侵略阴谋！
