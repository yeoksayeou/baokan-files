Significant Improvements in Fuel Industry Production in the Past Year
    Wang Lin

    (I)
    The Central People's Government has attached great importance to the fuel industry since its founding.
    New China's state-owned fuel industry (coal mines, electricity, petroleum) has achieved certain results in the past year; it has focused on restoring its original scale and has made many significant improvements in enterprise management.
    From the establishment of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government in October 1949 to August of this year, national conferences on coal mines, electricity, petroleum industry, and hydropower engineering were held successively. According to the provisions of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the future work guidelines and tasks of coal, electricity, and petroleum industries were determined. At each professional conference, Minister Chen Yu emphasized: "The fuel industry is the most important leading sector for restoring and developing production. The quality of our work directly affects the restoration and development of other industries. Therefore, we must do a good job in the fuel industry to ensure the smooth completion of the production tasks of other industries." Minister Chen Yu also called on everyone to learn from the advanced technology of the Soviet Union.
    In the past year, based on the current financial strength of the state, the Central People's Government has invested a considerable amount of capital in the fuel industry and has transferred a considerable number of technical personnel and administrative cadres to ensure the smooth completion of the production and construction tasks of the state-owned coal, electricity, and petroleum industries in the past year.

    (II)
    Currently, 80% of the total possible production mines of state-owned coal mines nationwide have been restored. The national coal output has increased by 29% compared to 1949 (of which state-owned coal mines account for 70%), fully supplying the needs of transportation, industry, civilian use, and export throughout the country. Due to the implementation of the economic accounting system, production costs have been reduced significantly compared to planned costs. In September, the coal prices of state-owned coal mines in Guannei (inside the passes, i.e., North China) generally decreased by about 24%, which is of great help to the development of industry and transportation. In terms of production efficiency, the Northeast and North China have reached 0.54 tons of coal produced per worker per day, an increase of 25% compared to last year. The average efficiency of all employees in the Hegang Coal Mine in Northeast China has reached 0.842 tons. What is particularly important is that many mining areas have increased the coal recovery rate, reducing the loss of national resources and thus extending the life of the mines.
    In May, the coal mine conference, based on the experiences and lessons learned in some mining areas, further made two historically significant decisions on improving production methods and safety issues. This was a major revolution in coal mine production in New China. Now, in the mining areas where mining methods have been improved, the recovery rate of thick coal seams has increased from 30% to 85%. The No. 105 coal mining team of the Hegang Mining Bureau in Northeast China has increased the recovery rate to 93% in a 6-meter-thick coal seam. Mi Hanzhang, a coal miner from the Huainan Coal Mine in Anhui Province, whose production efficiency was originally poorer than that of the mines in Northeast and North China, created a new record of producing 34 tons in 5 hours, which is very close to the production record of the early stage of the Soviet Stakhanovite movement.
    Since the improvement of coal mining methods, the working face has been extended, and the problem of underground ventilation has been solved, reducing the possibility of gas accumulation. Furthermore, due to the change from the backward room-and-pillar mining method to the longwall mining method and the replacement of the high-drop filling method with the gangue filling method, roof collapses, side collapses, and transportation accidents have been avoided, ensuring the reliability of safety in production.
    During the coal production and sales conference jointly held by the Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Ministry of Trade in August and September, in the spirit of "taking into account both public and private interests," issues such as the management of private coal mines and close coordination of production and sales were discussed, implementing "production based on sales" to strengthen the planning of coal mine production. The Jingxi Coal Mine, which supplies civilian fuel to the Beijing-Tianjin area, was transferred to the direct leadership of the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry. After inspection, arrangement, and strengthening of drainage, it has now resumed production. Under this new organization, it is estimated that the production cost of the mine will gradually decrease, following the state-owned coal mines in North China.
    Another important work in the coal mine industry in the past year is the abolition of the feudal foreman system, which has been weighing on the miners' heads for many years, in the coal mines of Northeast, North, and East China. This is of great significance for giving play to the workers' production enthusiasm and improving production efficiency.

    (III)
    Since liberation, under the leadership of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council and the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the national electricity industry has also achieved considerable results due to the active efforts of the workers and the continuous improvement of the management system. Before liberation, the main shortcomings in the national state-owned electricity industry were: low power generation capacity of power generating equipment, low utilization rate, large losses, high coal consumption, and insecurity. The phenomenon of "electricity shortage" was widespread in major regions. At the first national electricity conference held in February this year, these serious situations were criticized. On the one hand, the conservative ideas of some technicians were broken; on the other hand, the quota management system, the regular maintenance system, the safety production responsibility system, the sub-plant management, and other progressive experiences recommended by Soviet experts were introduced. This enabled the national electricity work to break away from the shackles of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism for decades and greatly move forward.
    According to statistics from the Ministry of Fuel Industry, in the past year, under the condition of almost no new machines being added, the national power supply of state-owned electricity industry has increased by 16.2% compared with the past year, and the electricity sales have increased by 53.4% compared with last year. This shows the great efforts of the electricity workers in reducing losses and increasing production in the past year. The average utilization rate of the national state-owned electricity industry's equipment has increased from 24.2% in the previous year to 28.3%. Due to the gradual establishment of the regular maintenance system and the strengthening of planned maintenance work, not only have power outages been reduced, but also the average power generation output of the national state-owned power plant equipment has increased from 65% in the previous year to 78.8% this year. The Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant and the Fengshan Power Plant of the Shijiazhuang Electric Power Bureau have reached 100%, breaking the conservative ideas of general technicians who are satisfied with the old production level.
    Due to the initial establishment of an advanced quota management system, the loss rate of the national state-owned electricity industry's transmission lines has gradually decreased to 16.97%, a decrease of 48.57% compared with the previous year. The coal consumption rate has decreased from the national average of 1.039 kilograms of coal per kilowatt-hour last year to 0.898 kilograms this year. The Tangshan Power Plant in North China has achieved the best results in the movement to reduce coal consumption. From October 1949 to May of this year, the plant has reduced coal consumption to 0.577 kilograms of coal per kilowatt-hour, not only creating a new record for the lowest coal consumption of the same type of power generation equipment in the country, but also approaching the advanced coal consumption standard of Soviet power plants.
    In total, in the past ten months, the national state-owned electricity industry has reduced electricity consumption and losses by 210 million kilowatt-hours, and coal savings have reached 140,000 tons. Due to the large amount of savings, the production cost of electricity has been reduced, and the electricity prices in some areas have gradually decreased, which has greatly facilitated the restoration and development of New China's industry.
    The number of accidents in the national state-owned electricity industry has also been greatly reduced compared with last year. The employees of the Fengman Hydropower Bureau in Northeast China and the Fengshan Power Plant of the Shijiazhuang Electric Power Bureau in North China have implemented the resolution of "ensuring safe power generation and supply throughout the year" passed by the first national electricity conference, creating a new record of safe operation without accidents for more than eight months. With the efforts of the employees, they continue to move towards the goal of "ensuring no accidents throughout the year." Due to the brilliant examples created by power plants such as Fengman and Fengshan, power plants in Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places have also created new achievements in safe power supply, and the technical level of power plants in other places has also been generally improved compared with the past.
    China's hydropower resources are very rich, second only to the Soviet Union and accounting for the second largest in the world. However, the currently developed hydropower only accounts for 0.39% of the possible utilization of hydropower resources. In order to meet the needs of industry and agriculture in the future, the national hydropower engineering conference held in July this year decided to focus on key survey work, gradually restore the existing foundation, give play to the effectiveness of existing equipment, and build new small hydropower plants under possible conditions. Before the flood season this year, the Fengman Hydropower Bureau, the main power source for industrial electricity in Northeast China, completed the emergency dyke construction task assigned to them by the Ministry of Fuel Industry ahead of schedule with high enthusiasm, resisted the largest flood in a century, and ensured the safety of the power plant and the dam. In Guannei, the Caoyangxi Hydropower Plant, which supplies power for the construction of the Gutianxi Hydropower Engineering Office in Fujian, completed the construction task ten days ahead of the original plan of seven months with the strong support of the Fujian Provincial People's Government and the united efforts of all employees. During the initial liberation of the Xiuwen Hydropower Engineering Office in Guizhou Province, all employees, workers, and police comrades persisted in five days and five nights of heroic fighting under the disparity of strength, resisted the attack of bandits and special agents, and protected the property of the people. These deeds were commended at the National Hydropower Conference.

    (IV)
    In terms of the state-owned petroleum industry, natural petroleum is mainly in the Northwest. After holding the first national petroleum industry conference, the Ministry of Fuel Industry transferred a large number of experienced geological experts from Shanghai and Sichuan to the Northwest in June this year to carry out exploration work. This year, the number of petroleum exploration teams has doubled compared with last year, and the number of drilling teams has also increased by one-half. The production of crude oil in the Yumen Mine in Gansu Province has increased by 25% under the principle of maintaining a reasonable oil-gas ratio, and the quality of various products has been improved.
    The Northeast's synthetic petroleum industry is mainly focused on restoring the original equipment. The factories in the Northeast are currently working on repairs. In July of this year, the Ministry of Fuel Industry invited chemistry professors and refining experts from Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Yenching University in Beijing to form a technical research group to conduct on-site investigations and research in the Northeast on how to improve refining technology and improve quality. Some achievements have been made. However, China's petroleum production has not been able to meet the needs, and in order to achieve self-sufficiency, we still need to intensify our work in this area.

    (V)
    In order to ensure the balance of production and sales and the needs of future industrial construction, the Ministry of Fuel Industry convened a national fuel industry planning conference in July and August of this year to formulate an outline of the three-year development plan for the national fuel industry from 1951 to 1953. This enabled the fuel industry to begin to move towards the path of a scientific planned economy.
    In short, the fuel industry has achieved considerable results in the past year under the correct leadership of the Central Government. However, in the process of work in the past year, due to insufficient inspection work, there are still some shortcomings in the leadership of enterprises. In addition, due to the incomplete planning, considerable waste and losses have also been caused in construction projects. In the future, we should focus on these shortcomings, combine the experiences and lessons learned in the work to thoroughly improve them, so as to ensure the gradual growth of the national coal mine, electricity, and petroleum industries and further development.

　　一年来燃料工业生产上的重大改进
    王林
    （一）
    中央人民政府成立之初就很重视燃料工业。
    新中国国营燃料工业（煤矿、电业、石油），一年来已经获得了某些成绩；已有重点地恢复了原有的规模，并在企业经营管理上作了很多重大的改进。
    一九四九年十月中央人民政府燃料工业部成立到今年八月份止，先后分别召开了全国性的煤矿、电业、石油工业和水力发电工程等专业会议。根据人民政协共同纲领的规定，确定了煤、电、石油等工业今后的工作方针与任务。在每次专业会议中，陈郁部长都曾着重指出：“燃料工业是恢复和发展生产最重要的前驱部门，我们工作的好坏直接影响到其他工业的恢复与发展。因此，我们必须把燃料工业搞好，才能保证其他工业生产任务的顺利完成。”陈郁部长并号召大家学习苏联的先进技术。
    一年来，根据目前国家财政力量的可能，中央人民政府在燃料工业方面，投入了相当数量的资金，并调配了相当数目的技术人员和行政干部，保证了国营煤、电、石油工业一年来生产与修建任务的顺利完成。
    （二）
    目前全国国营煤矿的全部可能生产矿井已恢复百分之八十。全国煤产量比一九四九年增加百分之二十九（其中国营煤矿占百分之七十），充分供应之全国各地交通、工业、民用和出口等项需要。由于经济核算制度的实行，生产成本上比计划成本减低了很多。九月间关内各个国营煤矿的矿山煤价更普遍降低约百分之二十四，这对工业与交通的发展是有很大的帮助的。在生产效率方面，东北、华北已达每工每日产煤零点五四吨，较去年提高百分之二十五。东北鹤岗煤矿的全员平均效率已达零点八四二吨。尤其重要的是不少矿区已经提高了煤的回收率，使国家资源的损失得以减少因而延长矿山的寿命。
    今年五月煤矿会议根据某些矿区已取得的经验和教训，更进一步地对于改进生产方法和保安问题曾作出两项有历史意义的重大决定，这是新中国煤矿生产中的一次大革命。现在业已改进采煤方法的矿区，其厚煤层的回收率已由百分之三十提高到百分之八十五。东北鹤岗矿务局一○五号采煤场子在六公尺厚的煤层里，已将回收率提高到百分之九十三。原比东北、华北各矿生产效率较差的安徽准南煤矿的采煤工米汉章，更创造了五小时生产三十四吨的新纪录，已极接近苏联斯塔哈诺夫运动初期的生产纪录。
    自采煤方法改进后，工作面延长，相继解决了井下通风问题，减少瓦斯积存的可能性。更由于将落后的房柱式采煤方法改为长壁式采煤方法及用矸石充填法代替高落式充填法的缘故，避免了冒顶片帮和运输等事故，使生产中的安全得到可靠的保障。
    在八月至九月间中央燃料工业部、贸易部共同举行的煤炭产销会议中，根据“公私兼顾”的精神，曾讨论私营煤矿的管理和产销密切配合等问题，实行“以销定产”，以加强煤矿生产的计划性。供应京、津一带民用燃料的京西煤矿，改归中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局直接领导，经检查布置与加强排水后，现已恢复生产。在此新组织下，估计该矿生产成本必将随华北各个国营煤矿之后逐渐降低。
    一年来煤矿工业中的另一重要工作，是在东北、华北、华东各煤矿废除多少年来压在矿工头上的封建把头制度。这对于发挥工人的生产积极性和提高生产效率是有重大意义的。
    （三）
    自从解放以来，全国电力工业在政务院财政经济委员会和燃料工业部的领导下，由于工人群众的积极努力和管理制度的不断改进，也获得了不少的成绩。解放前，全国国营电业中存在的主要缺点是：发电设备的发电能力低、利用率低、损失大、煤耗高和不安全，各主要地区普遍存在着“电荒”现象。在今年二月举行的第一次全国电业会议中，曾对这些严重的情况加以批判，一方面打破某些技术人员的保守思想；另一方面介绍苏联专家建议的定额管理制度、定期检修制度、安全生产专责制、分场管理以及其他的进步经验。这样就使全国电业工作摆脱了几十年来帝国主义和官僚资本主义的桎梏，大大地向前推进了一步。
    据中央燃料工业部统计，一年来在几乎没有增添新机器的条件下，全国国营电业的供电量已比过去一年中增加百分之十六点二，而售电量更比去年增加百分之五十三点四，这就说明了电业职工一年来在减少损失和增加生产方面的巨大努力。全国国营电业设备的平均利用率已由上年度的百分之二十四点二提高到百分之二十八点三。由于定期检修制度的逐渐建立，和有计划的检修工作的加强，不但减少了停电事故，更使全国国营电厂设备平均的发电出力由上年度的百分之六十五提高到今年的百分之七十八点八。北京石景山发电厂和石家庄电业局的凤山发电厂且已达到了百分之百，打破了一般技术人员满足于旧生产水平的保守思想。
    由于初步建立了先进的定额管理制度，使国营电业的输电线路损失率逐渐降低到百分之十六点九七，较上年度减少百分之四十八点五七。煤耗率已由去年全国平均的每度电用煤一点零三九公斤降低到今年的零点八九八公斤。在减低煤耗的运动中，成绩最好的是华北的唐山电厂。该厂自一九四九年十月至今年五月的时期中，已使煤耗减到每度电用煤零点五七七公斤，不但创造了全国同类型发电设备的最低煤耗新纪录，且已接近苏联电厂先进的煤耗标准。
    综计全国国营电业最近十个月中，电力消耗和损失减少了二亿一千万度，燃煤节省达十四万吨。由于大量节约的结果，使电业生产成本降低，个别地区的电价也逐渐减低，这就使新中国工业的恢复和发展得到了极大的便利。
    全国国营电业的事故亦较去年减少很多。东北丰满水电局和华北石家庄电业局凤山发电厂全体职工，更贯彻了第一次全国电业会议通过的“保证全年安全发供电”的决议，创造了八个月以上无事故的安全运转新纪录。并在职工同志们的努力下继续向“保证全年无事故”的目标迈进。由于丰满、凤山等电厂所创造的光辉榜样，更使天津、青岛等地电厂也都相继创造了新的安全供电成绩，其他各地电厂的技术水平也比过去普遍地提高了一步。
    中国的水力资源非常丰富，仅次于苏联而占全世界的第二位。但目前已经开发的水力仅占可能利用的水力资源的百分之零点三九。为了配合今后工业和农业上的需要，在今年七月间召开的全国水力发电工程会议中，决定以重点勘测工作为主，逐渐恢复已有的基础，发挥现有设备的效能，并在可能的条件下修建新的小型水电厂。在今年洪水期前，供给东北工业用电的主要电源——丰满水电局，在职工高度的热情工作下，提前的完成中央燃料工业部交给他们的紧急筑堤任务，抵抗了百年以来最大一次洪水的袭击，保证了电厂和堤坝的安全。在关内，供给福建古田溪水力发电工程处营造动力用的曹洋溪水电厂，在福建省人民政府的大力支持和全体职工的团结努力下，建厂的施工期间比原计划七个月提早了十天完成任务。贵州省修文水力发电工程处在刚解放时，全体职、工、警同志在众寡悬殊的情况下，坚持五天五夜的英勇战斗，抵御了匪特的进攻，保卫了人民的财产。这些事迹都在全国水力发电会议中得到大会的表扬。
    （四）
    在国营石油工业方面，天然石油以西北为主。中央燃料工业部在召开第一次全国石油工业会议之后，于今年六月间从上海和四川等地区抽调大批有经验的地质专家到西北去进行探勘工作。今年的石油钻探队已较去年增加两倍，钻井队也增加了二分之一。甘肃玉门矿原油的生产量在保持合理的油气比的原则下，已增加百分之二十五，并提高了各种产品的质量。
    东北的人造石油工业以重点恢复原有设备为主。现在东北各厂正在着手修复中。中央燃料工业部在今年七月间并邀集北京北大、清华、燕京三大学的化学教授和炼油专家组织技术研究团，前往东北实地调查与研究如何改进炼油技术和提高品质等问题。已获得部分成绩。但中国石油产量尚未能供应需要，为谋自给，这方面的工作还有待我们加紧进行。
    （五）
    为了保证产销平衡以及今后工业建设的需要，中央燃料工业部于今年七、八月间曾召开全国燃料工业计划会议，制订了一九五一年至一九五三年全国燃料工业的三年发展计划轮廓。使燃料工业开始走向科学的计划经济的道路。
    总之，一年来的燃料工业，在中央的正确领导之下已获得不少的成绩。但在一年来的工作过程中，对于企业的领导方面，由于检查工作不够，还存在着若干缺点。此外，由于计划的未尽周密，在修建工程中也造成了不少的浪费和损失。今后亟应针对着这些缺点，结合工作中的经验教训彻底加以改进，才能保证全国煤矿、电力、石油工业的逐渐壮大与更进一步地向前发展。
