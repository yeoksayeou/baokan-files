Regarding Several Issues Concerning Urban Women's Work
    Report by Deng Yingchao, Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, at the Third Enlarged Executive Committee Meeting of the Federation

Currently, there are eighty-seven cities directly under the jurisdiction of provinces or municipalities, including those directly under administrative offices. Among them, eighty-three cities have successively established women's federations or preparatory committees for women's federations, carrying out work among women in urban and suburban areas. Over the past year, urban women's work has undergone a tortuous process of exploration, achieving experiences and successes: First, it has assisted trade unions in basically organizing industrial female workers, raising their political awareness. The women's federation has also made considerable efforts in mobilizing female workers to actively participate in production, improving their cultural and technical skills, and providing special welfare considerations. Second, it has generally organized household laboring women to participate in handicraft production and military supply production, and has carried out work among other housewives, establishing organizations. In cities near the war zone, it has mobilized a vast number of women to support the front lines. Through propaganda, education, and organization among the broad masses of women, women's federations in various cities have made them increasingly support the policies of the People's Government and participate in the production, democratic politics, cultural education, and municipal public security work of the people's cities. At the same time, the status of women in the family and society is gradually improving, and some of the special sufferings of women are beginning to be or have been gradually alleviated. Various rights of equality between men and women have been legally guaranteed.

However, because the All-China Democratic Women's Federation failed to combine the urban women's work guidelines formulated at the First National Women's Congress of China with the actual conditions of various cities in a timely manner for guidance, and failed to provide timely and sufficient assistance in solving difficulties that could be solved, and summarizing and promoting new experiences, coupled with the fact that urban women's work itself is a new and complex subject, with leaders and cadres lacking experience, it must go through a process of exploration to obtain more complete experience. Therefore, there are still some shortcomings and some fundamental problems in the current urban women's work that have not been fully and appropriately resolved. To this end, we would like to put forward our views on several major problems existing in the current urban women's work.

(1) The principle of making production the central task of the urban women's movement must be further combined with reality.

Since the First National Women's Congress of China determined the principle of making production the central task of the urban women's movement, more than a year of practice has fully proved that this principle is correct. The current problem is not in the principle itself, but rather that some cadres, when implementing the principle of organizing women to participate in production based on female workers, failed to proceed from the specific actual conditions of the local cities, but mechanically and linearly understood and implemented it. When encountering obstacles in their work, they also failed to consult with the trade unions to study and make appropriate solutions and continue to persevere. When organizing household laboring women to produce, some cadres had the idea of aiming too high and being eager for quick success; some cadres had the desire and practice of grasping everything and engaging in large-scale undertakings, and even had the idea of gratuitously satisfying the demands of the masses in an all-round way without distinguishing between priority, importance, urgency, and slowness (these shortcomings have been and are being corrected). The All-China Women's Federation lacked guidance on how to specifically implement this principle, and also failed to provide timely education and explanation based on the cadres' ideological situation, for which the All-China Women's Federation should be responsible. On the other hand, due to the overall production situation in the considerable period after the liberation of cities, it was mostly focused on maintaining and restoring, and even had a state of stagnation and shrinking; moreover, due to the lack of planning in the economic construction of most cities, especially the blindness of handicraft production, which could not be overcome in a short period of time, this presented a lack of production channels, fragmented, intermittent, and fluctuating, which further increased the many difficulties in organizing women to participate in production. At the same time, there are a large number of unemployed household laboring women in various cities, who urgently demand production and demand solutions to their livelihood problems. This series of problems is a major issue concerning the country and society, which cannot be solved solely by the women's federation. Cadres failed to fully grasp, analyze, and study these objective conditions, and proceed from practical possibilities; and some ideas contradicted reality; or proceeding from subjective enthusiasm, one-sidedly emphasized the demands of the masses, which caused new difficulties, making it more difficult to overcome existing objective difficulties, and hindering the organization of women's production to a certain extent. All this has caused some cadres to waver in the implementation of the policy, and even doubt it. Therefore, we must have a clear understanding in our thinking, and further combine the implementation of the policy with reality, and adopt appropriate practices.

At present, the people of the whole country are striving to create the conditions for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation as pointed out by Chairman Mao, and the People's Government is focusing on maintaining, restoring, and developing production. The economies of various localities are also showing signs of improvement. Land reform will be carried out in vast areas and suburban areas of some cities this winter. Undoubtedly, with the improvement of the overall financial and economic situation, the objective conditions for organizing women to participate in production will also improve accordingly. And only when women participate in production and become creators of social and family wealth can they truly realize the various laws and regulations on equality between men and women stipulated by the government, and truly enjoy various rights of equality between men and women. To this end, we must adhere to and implement the policy of making production the central task of the women's movement. For the women's federations in various localities, the main task in implementing this policy is to cooperate with trade unions and various production organs to educate and organize women to participate in production, improve their enthusiasm for production, and carry out specific work such as cultural education, childcare, maternal and child health, and assisting relevant parties in implementing labor protection conditions around the production policy, and to resolve the difficulties encountered by women in production. However, the local women's federations should also actively cooperate with relevant organs to carry out women's production undertakings that may and must be undertaken in the local area.

First, it is necessary to determine different priorities and take different steps to gradually realize them based on the specific conditions of each city, the policy guidelines of the local People's Government and the current central tasks, the current market supply and demand situation, the original production foundation of the women, and the possibilities. In industrial cities or regions with many female workers, female workers and their family members should be the main targets; in industrial cities or mining areas with very few female workers, in addition to carrying out work among a small number of female workers, family members of workers should be the main focus; in non-industrial cities, where there are very few female workers and family members, in addition to carrying out work among them, household laboring women should be the main target. Generally speaking, under the guidance of the overall policy of focusing on restoring and developing production in various cities, the main task for female workers in employment is to carry out propaganda and education to improve their ideological awareness, promote enthusiasm for production, increase output, improve quality, learn technology, participate in production competitions, and resolve the special difficulties and ideological obstacles encountered in participating in production. When carrying out work among female workers and their families, the women's federation should divide responsibilities and cooperate under the unified leadership of the trade union. Some uncoordinated phenomena have existed in the relationship between the women's federation and the relevant departments of the trade union, and appropriate solutions should be made in terms of ideology, organization, and working methods in the future.

Any city with unemployed female workers should, in accordance with the instructions of the Government Administration Council on providing relief to unemployed workers, appropriately strive for female workers to receive the same relief treatment stipulated by the government as male workers with the same conditions. Participate in work-for-relief, production for self-rescue, and vocational training under possible conditions, with equal opportunities. Regarding the phenomenon of discrimination against unemployed and semi-unemployed female workers in some areas in handling unemployment relief work, it should be corrected through consultation with the relevant competent authorities. In addition, unemployed female workers should be given appropriate education and training. For women's federations in disaster-stricken cities, the main urgent task is disaster relief, and the combination of production and disaster relief should be emphasized.

For organizing household laboring women to participate in handicraft production, it is still necessary and possible at present. Among the handicraft production that women have already participated in, some of them have prospects. At the same time, it must be clearly recognized that the policy of organizing women's handicraft production should focus on restoration and development, rather than universal restoration and development. It is necessary to be realistic, start from small things, and focus on long-term development planning. The main direction of specific efforts is as follows:

1.  Combine with public and private factories to organize women to do auxiliary handicraft processing and production inside or outside the factory.
2.  Organize women to participate in the production of special handicrafts that can be sold abroad, or the processing of industrial and agricultural products for export, such as drawnwork, lace, straw braid, porcelain, etc., and the latter such as picking walnuts, picking soybeans, picking pig bristles, etc.
3.  Facing the countryside, organize women to participate in handicraft production that meets the needs of farmers.
4.  Organize women to participate in the production or processing of daily necessities for staff and workers of various organs, schools, and groups, such as sewing and washing clothes.
5.  In organizing women's production, special attention should be paid to maintaining and restoring the past production base, which is still easy to restore, and currently does not require huge investment, and can mainly rely on sales turnover to solve the funds themselves.

Based on past experience, the methods that women's federations should adopt are as follows:

1.  Closely cooperate with the government's financial and economic organs, cooperatives, public and private factories, etc., assist them in organizing and educating women to participate in production according to their established production policies, plans, and specific steps, so as to improve production efficiency and product quality, and realize the government's production plan. Ask them to help women open up production channels and solve the difficulties in women's production. The women's federation should actively cooperate with the above-mentioned economic and financial organs and relevant organizations such as public and private enterprises. The method of cooperation ranges from consultation on matters to striving to participate in relevant meetings and relevant organizations (such as the production unified organization in Chahar Province, which has regular meetings), and under unified leadership, divide responsibilities, cooperate, and advance together.
2.  Follow the mass line, gather the masses' own idle funds, and use the masses' own experience to find production paths and solve the difficulties in product sales. Experience has proved that this is much better than relying solely on a few cadres, running around everywhere, and hitting walls everywhere.
3.  The principle of "relying on the mountains to eat the mountains, relying on the water to eat the water", "taking materials locally, doing whatever is available" should be advocated to organize a variety of regular or temporary production, and try to solve the difficulties of the masses of women as much as possible from all aspects. Do not attempt to solve the production and livelihood problems of the majority of people by engaging in one or two large-scale productions at a time.
4.  Insist on encouraging women to learn technology, improve technology, and improve product quality. It is advocated that unskilled or poorly skilled laboring women should learn technology and cooperate with skilled male workers, divide labor between men and women, and cooperate to complete production tasks. In particular, it is necessary to strictly correct the practice of accommodating the backwardness of the masses from the perspective of relief and charity. Production specifications must be clearly defined, and a strict inspection system must be implemented to strive to improve product quality.
5.  A variety of forms, regardless of size, should be used to organize women's production, and the most basic is the handicraft production cooperative organization based on industry. Women engaged in each industry can participate in the cooperative or labor mutual aid group in that industry. This kind of cooperative is currently suitable for unified leadership and decentralized operation, and collective production can only be organized and maintained under certain conditions. In the past, some cities simply organized women's handicraft production cooperatives, or reluctantly organized household handicraftsmen to produce collectively, and most of their results were failures. In addition, according to the current development of urban cooperatives and the requirements of the urban masses of women, attention should be paid to organizing women to participate in consumer cooperatives.

In order to implement the above-mentioned policies and tasks, production must be combined with cultural and political education, and the obstacles and special feudal shackles to women's participation in production must be appropriately removed. To this end, women's federations in various cities should work harder to assist the People's Government and relevant parties in promoting childcare, maternal and child health, and implementing the new Marriage Law.

The future direction of developing childcare services is to further serve the vast number of manual laborers, mental laborers, and their children, and to help them run various childcare institutions and kindergartens. In industrial cities with more female workers, priority should be given to rectifying or adding childcare institutions and kindergartens in factories. In non-industrial cities, emphasis should be placed on helping female teachers run childcare institutions and kindergartens. Among female workers, workers' families, and household laboring women in various cities, knowledge of childcare and new childcare methods should be widely publicized. In the suburbs, rural seasonal nurseries can be tried out. The principle of running childcare institutions must be based on the living standards, economic capacity, and the human and financial resources of relevant parties, parental needs, and children's interests to determine the receiving time, living standards, and equipment scale of the nursery. Focus on running small-scale semi-boarding facilities, or try to run full-boarding facilities when possible. In short, we must strive to use existing human and financial resources to run various nurseries and serve more children. Do not attempt to use one standard to unify various nurseries. As for the method of solving the human and financial resources of nurseries, at present, it is first necessary to promote the joint efforts of the administrative aspects of relevant factories, mining areas, organs, and schools, trade unions, and parents to establish them. Secondly, it is necessary to promote people who are enthusiastic about children's careers and public welfare to contribute money, effort, technology, and ideas to run various childcare institutions. Possible assistance should be given to privately run childcare services to gradually develop them, and they should not be merged or squeezed out. In order to adapt to the current needs, we should cultivate or train childcare cadres as much as possible, and unite, educate, and transform the original childcare staff.

The focus of maternal and child health work in industrial cities should be on industrial female workers and workers' families. First, it is necessary to ensure the implementation of the maternal and child treatment stipulated in the labor protection regulations, and under possible conditions, increase the maternal and child health personnel in factories, improve health facilities, and solve some problems that can be solved currently. In non-industrial cities, the focus should be on poor laboring women. In order to do this work well, we should unite and educate the original maternal and child health medical staff (especially the larger number of midwives), transform the old midwives, and train new maternal and child health cadres. This is a necessary and valuable asset for carrying out maternal and child health work. In addition, the women's federation should widely publicize common sense about maternal and child health, and oppose superstitious and backward delivery methods and treatment methods. Experience has proved that this publicity work is very popular among the masses and can play a certain role in improving maternal and child health.

The facts in many cities have proved that unmarried female workers and women from all walks of life have suffered deeply from the oppression and pain of old-fashioned marriages, which hinders their production mood and damages their health. Women's federations in various localities should vigorously assist the government in implementing the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, and carry out long-term propaganda and education work on the Marriage Law so that everyone knows it. When necessary and possible, the women's federation should participate in the jury of marriage cases, attend and listen in, mediate family disputes, oppose abuse and persecution of women, especially behaviors that hinder women's participation in production, and eliminate the feudal traditional customs that bind women in a step-by-step manner.

(2) Issues of Working Methods

The first task of urban work methods must be to make a practical and thorough transformation of the rural perspective and one-size-fits-all working methods that have been cultivated for a long time in the past, and replace them with a centralized and unified overall thinking and a scientific method of division of labor and cooperation. There must be unified leadership and a clear division of labor. There must be a competent organ and an assisting aspect. The competent organ should be actively responsible for its competent business, and the assisting and cooperating organs should also work hard to participate, divide labor, cooperate, and promote together. It is not about competing for leadership or who gets the credit, but everything should start from the interests of the people and the overall interests.

The nature and scope of the work of the women's federation is broad and complex, but the main thing is to combine with the central tasks of the local People's Government, and carry out work in a planned, step-by-step, focused manner. On the one hand, in accordance with the policies and policies of the People's Government, carry out propaganda, organization, education and other work among the masses of women; on the other hand, reflect the demands and opinions of the masses of women to the People's Government, assist the People's Government in determining the policies and plans related to women and children's work, improve work, supervise implementation. And when necessary, request instructions and consultations from relevant government departments. In order to complete a specific task, it is possible to suggest that the relevant government departments establish a joint meeting, strive to send representatives to participate in the relevant organizations of the government, or organize a temporary or permanent institution for a certain work under the government.

Therefore, for the work that is under the charge of the women's federation, it is necessary to actively cooperate with the relevant organs. For the work that is under the charge of other organs, the women's federation should also actively cooperate and promote together. According to the construction plan of the local People's Government, the local central work, and estimate the objective conditions and the subjective strength of the women's federation, distinguish between importance, primary and secondary, priority, and urgency, and take specific, organizational, and working steps, not only limited to individual temporary cooperation, but should gradually reach a certain regular cooperative relationship and possible appropriate organizational form. It is necessary to correct the practices of "cooperating in everything" losing the center, "cooperating everywhere" dispersing strength, and falling into a passive situation.

The working method of dividing labor, cooperating with each other, and cooperating has begun to be clarified and gradually affirmed in the minds of our cadres, and there have also been some improvements in the work, which must be adhered to. But now some women's work cadres "are afraid of trouble, afraid of being snubbed, and unwilling to consult and cooperate with relevant parties", and attempt to simply do a set by the women's federation alone, otherwise they will cancel the women's group and separate women's work, and merge it into the relevant departments of the People's Government and people's organizations. Neither of these two ideas starts from today's national conditions of China, and does not recognize that women have the same requirements as men of their own class, and also have special requirements; they need both separate women's groups and women's work, and need to cooperate with relevant parties; they also need to promote women's work through female cadres in various work positions. Only in this way can we actively and purposefully cooperate with relevant parties. If this characteristic is violated and hard work is sought, the result will only be self-distress and useless. At the same time, leaders of various parties and female cadres in various positions are required to regard the policy of liberating women and implementing equality between men and women as their own responsibility.

(3) On the Issue of Organizing the Masses of Women

According to the current national conditions and special circumstances of women in China, even if there are organizations for specific work such as people's groups, all walks of life, production, cooperation, and culture, it is still not enough. A general separate women's organization is still needed "to lead and promote women's work, unite and educate the broad masses of women, and regularly serve women." Therefore, the organization of the Democratic Women's Federation is still necessary. Not only should there be no thoughts and practices of canceling women's work, but it should be strengthened and the status of women's work should be raised to a higher, broader, and more important position to meet the needs of the current decisive victory of the revolution in the whole country. Face the broad masses of women in China and guide them to participate in the various construction undertakings of New China together with men. The organization of the masses of women should be broad, not strict, because if it is too strict, it will not be able to widely contact the broad masses of women to carry out work. To this end, the First Women's Congress of China pointed out: it is necessary to improve the organizational situation of women, improve the contact between the women's federation and the masses of women, and use the organizational form of the women's representative meeting to organize the masses of women. Experience has proved that various women's representative meetings in urban and rural areas are indeed in line with the current level of awareness and organization of Chinese women, and are a main and best organizational form that can more widely, democratically, and flexibly contact the masses of women; it combines the leadership and the masses through countless representatives as a link.

Women's representative meetings can be organized by region for general comprehensive purposes, or by various occupations for single occupational purposes. The former can be convened by the women's federation, and the latter can be convened by the women's federation in consultation with the organizations of each occupation, or by the women's departments of the organizational institutions of each occupation. The organization of women's representative meetings in various occupations is an integral part of the organizations of each occupation, but at the same time, representatives can be selected to participate in the general comprehensive women's representative meeting in the region. The task of women's representative meetings in various occupations is to "add an effort" among women in each occupation to help them solve certain special problems, so as to strengthen the unity of men and women in the occupation and better complete the central tasks of the occupation group. The regional women's representative meeting is to discuss and solve the common special problems of general women, carry out propaganda organization and promote women's work, convey and implement the laws and policies of the People's Government, participate in democratic construction, and become a powerful helper of the People's Government. By doing so, it can correct the deviation of neglecting the special interests of women and avoid isolated and prominent practices. Women's federations in various localities should earnestly and effectively expand the contact with organized and unorganized women's masses through women's representative meetings, and become a main form that is used regularly, not an occasional or temporary use. Women's representative meetings above the city and county level can be held regularly, and women's representative meetings below the city and county level should be more flexible, and can be held when needed, and can be closed if there is nothing to do. Necessary preparations must be made for holding various women's representative meetings. The meeting must be held well, with both a central topic and a wide range of discussions. It is necessary to promote democracy, gather wisdom, and carry out criticism and self-criticism, but the time should not be too long. Each time, one or two necessary and possible problems should be solved in a concentrated manner. After the meeting, attention should be paid to organizing communication and checking the implementation situation.

Experience over the past year has proved that in large and medium-sized cities with a population of more than 300,000, district-level democratic women's federations can be organized, or various district-level women's work institutions that have been adopted by some cities (such as the district offices of the municipal democratic women's federations, the joint offices of street women's representative meetings, etc.). Cities with a population of less than 300,000 may not establish district-level women's federations, and the municipal women's federation directly leads the district and street women's representative meetings. In cities in multi-ethnic areas, mixed organizational forms or single organizational forms of the ethnic groups can be adopted according to the wishes of the ethnic groups to facilitate enhancing ethnic feelings and promoting ethnic unity.

Democratic women's federations at all levels are all group membership systems and do not adopt individual membership systems. If individual women request to join the women's federation, they can be introduced to join their respective industry organizations or other women's groups with individual membership systems.

(4) Further Strengthen and Expand the Unity of Women from All Walks of Life

From the All-China Democratic Women's Federation to the democratic women's federations at all levels, they are all the broadest united front organizations under the leadership of the working class, based on working-class and peasant women, uniting petty-bourgeois women, national bourgeois women, and all patriotic democratic women; therefore, the organizations of the democratic women's federations at all levels, from the grassroots organizations to the upper-level leading institutions, must run through this spirit, and must unite the local ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, and non-party democratic women as much as possible, participate in organizations, various tasks, all the way to leadership work at all levels. This united front policy is suitable for the needs of China's national conditions, and is one of the basic characteristics of the Chinese revolution. It is long-term, not temporary, and not only the All-China Women's Federation should do this, but women's federations at all levels should implement it consistently. But in reality, the general understanding of the women's federations at all levels was vague at the beginning and did not pay attention to it. Some women's federations have gradually paid more attention to it than before, and some have made some improvements, while the general tendency of closed-doorism still exists quite universally.

In the future, women's federations at all levels should, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, cooperate closely with four friends and fight against three enemies. It is necessary to distinguish between enemies and friends, and there should be basic differences in treating enemies and friends. Treat friends equally, and treat them the same in terms of work, study, and treatment, and deal with problems according to the same standards. To this end, we must strengthen our attention to the women's united front work, widely unite all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, various religious beliefs, and all other patriotic democratic women, and earnestly and practically carry out the united front work. On the basis of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the resolutions of the First National Women's Congress, and the Constitution of the Democratic Women's Federation, we are good at using the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to implement policies. Enrich and expand the women's united front organizationally and in terms of work. In multi-ethnic areas, special attention should be paid to implementing ethnic policies. We must be brave in carrying out the united front work in the women's aspect. Women of all ethnic groups, parties, and non-parties must respect each other, break down doubts, treat each other sincerely, consult on matters, have positions and powers, do a good job, and seek progress together. And regular and specific work and study organizations are important steps to enrich the content of the women's united front and specifically carry out the united front work. We must be vigilant against the enemy, and must overcome the tendency of closed-doorism and unprincipled accommodation in the women's united front work, and oppose the vulgar understanding and practice of reducing the content of the united front work to merely emotional contact and social entertainment.

(5) Propaganda and Education Work

All revolutionary work and new things, when they begin to awaken the attention of the masses, must go through a certain development process before they can become the thoughts and actions of the masses and generate great power. The process from the beginning of the proposal of each newly occurring problem to the mature solution is to first start with propaganda, explanation, and education, and then follow it up with systematic propaganda work. To realize the policy of equality between men and women and the cause of women's liberation, almost every step must be combined with propaganda and education work in order to better promote the work. Especially since the remnants of the traditional Chinese feudal idea of ​​valuing men and devaluing women have not been eliminated, in order to turn neglecting women's work into valuing women's work, it is even more necessary to use facts, reason, and the Common Program and the policy of equality between men and women to conduct long-term and untiring propaganda, explanation, and education work in combination with the local central work. The women's liberation movement is an educational movement, and in practice, it gradually leads them to the road of production and construction. Therefore, propaganda and education work is an important and indispensable part of women's work; at the same time, it is the primary step to enter the organization of the masses of women and promote women's work. The women's federation should not only have a special organization, but also must implement propaganda and education work into various businesses and work links of the women's federation, and awaken and educate the broad masses of women to strive to participate in the construction of New China. At present, our primary propaganda content is to strive for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation. Resolutely break the old ideas that hinder women from participating in various labor production and social, economic, political, and cultural activities. Gradually organize women to participate in labor production and social, economic, political, and cultural activities, and remove their special difficulties. All propaganda work should be centered on this.

We generally do not pay enough attention to propaganda and education work. Although some women's federations have paid more attention to it than before, they are not completely carrying out work in a planned and step-by-step manner, and they have not summarized it in a timely manner afterwards. In the future, pay special attention to the different environments from long-term war to peaceful construction, and from rural areas to cities, and make every effort to make timely use of the city's diverse propaganda tools and convenient conditions (such as newspapers, magazines, books, dramas, movies, radio, etc.) and relevant institutions (such as news agencies, civil education centers, schools, literacy classes, etc.) to closely cooperate in the work. The women's federation should regularly provide manuscripts and materials related to women, explain issues related to women's work, so as to expand propaganda and education work; and regularly exchange the experiences of women's work in various localities, and reflect the demands and problems of the masses of women, so that women's work can be widely developed. At present, there are three regular women's magazines and 29 regular and irregular women's supplements published by various daily newspapers across the country. The responsible women's federations should strengthen leadership and review and summarize, and improve and improve from all aspects such as editing policies, methods, and supplement content, so as to further become a garden for educating and contacting and organizing the masses of women and exchanging women's work experience.

At present, it is necessary to conduct cultural, political, and professional education for women's work cadres in a planned and systematic manner, especially to train grassroots women's work cadres. To this end, women's federations in various localities should run various training classes under possible conditions to train women's work cadres below the county level locally, and cadres above the county level should be trained separately by the provincial, large administrative region, and national women's federations.

　　关于城市妇女工作的几个问题
    全国民主妇女联合会副主席邓颖超在该会第三次执委扩大会议上的报告
    现在全国省以上的直属市包括行署直属市在内共有八十七个，其中八十三个市已先后成立了妇联会或妇联筹委会，在城市和郊区的妇女群众中进行着工作。一年来，城市妇女工作通过了曲折的摸索过程，取得了经验和成绩：首先是协助工会基本上组织了产业女工，提高了女工政治觉悟，在动员女工积极参加生产、提高女工的文化、技术及特殊福利的照顾等方面，妇联也做了不少的努力。其次，一般地组织了家庭的劳动妇女，参加了手工业生产和军需生产，并在其他家庭妇女中进行了工作，建立了组织。接近战区的城市，发动了广大妇女支援前线。各城市妇联在广大妇女群众中经过宣传、教育、组织等工作步骤，因而她们日益拥护人民政府的政策，参加了人民城市的生产事业、民主政治、文化教育和市政公安等工作。同时妇女在家庭与社会的地位，也正在逐渐提高，妇女们的特殊痛苦，有些正在开始或已在逐渐解除，男女平等的各种权利，得到了合法的保障。
    但是由于全国民主妇联未能将中国妇女第一次代表大会所制订的城市妇女工作方针，结合各城市的实际情况及时指导，未能适时地、足够地帮助解决可能解决的困难，总结和推广新的经验，再加上城市妇女工作本身是新的复杂的课题，领导与干部均缺乏经验，必须经过摸索过程，才能得到较完整的经验。因此，目前城市妇女工作中，还存在着若干缺点和某些带基本性的问题，未能获得完全的适当的解决。为此，特提出我们对目前城市妇女工作中存在的几个主要问题的意见。
    （一）城市妇女运动以生产为中心任务的方针要更进一步地与实际结合
    从中国妇女第一次全国代表大会确定了城市妇女运动以生产为中心任务的方针以后，一年多的实践，完全证明这个方针是正确的。目前的问题不是在这方针的本身，而是一方面由于有些干部在执行以女工为基础组织妇女参加生产的方针时，未能从当地城市的具体实际情况出发，而是机械地、直线地去了解和执行；在工作遇到阻碍时，又未能与工会协商研究，作适当的解决和继续坚持。在组织家庭劳动妇女生产时，有些干部有好高鹜远，急于求成的思想；有些干部有一把抓、搞大规模事业的愿望和作法，更有着不分先后、轻重、缓急的全面满足群众要求的恩赐观点（这些缺点已在和正在纠正中）。而全国妇联对于如何具体贯彻这方针，缺乏指导，也未能根据干部的思想情况，加以及时地教育解释，这一点全国妇联应有责任的。另一方面，由于在城市解放后相当期间内的整个生产情况，多以维持恢复为主，甚至有停滞缩小的状况；更由于绝大部分城市经济建设尚未进入计划性，特别是手工业生产的盲目性，更非一时所能克服，因而在这方面呈现着缺乏生产门路，零零碎碎，时有时无，此起彼伏，更增了组织妇女参加生产的很多困难。同时各城市又存在着大量的无业的家庭劳动妇女，迫切地要求生产，要求解决生活问题。这一系列问题，是有关国家社会的大问题，不可能单由妇联包揽包干所能解决的。对于这些客观状况，干部既未能全面掌握，分析研究，从实际可能出发办事；而有些思想又与现实抵触；或从主观热情出发，片面强调群众要求，由此而引起新的困难，影响着更难克服客观存在的困难，使组织妇女生产受到了某些阻碍。这一切遂引起了有些干部对方针执行上的摇摆，以致有所怀疑。因此，我们必须在思想上有明确的认识，在贯彻方针上要进一步地与实际结合，采用适当的作法。
    目前全国人民正在为创造毛主席所指出的争取国家财政经济状况基本好转的条件而奋斗，人民政府正在有重点地维持恢复和发展生产，各地工商业也显露了好转的征兆，今冬广大地区及某些城市的郊区将进行土地改革。无疑的，随着整个财经状况的好转，组织妇女参加生产的客观条件亦将随之而好转。而妇女只有参加了生产，成为社会和家庭财富的创造者，才能真正实现政府所规定的各项男女平等的法令，才能真正享受男女平等的各项权利。为此，我们必须坚持贯彻妇女运动以生产为中心任务的方针。而贯彻这个方针，在各地妇联来说，主要是配合工会和各种生产机关，以教育组织妇女参加生产，提高生产积极性，围绕生产方针，进行文化教育、儿童保育、妇婴卫生及协助有关方面贯彻劳保条件等具体工作，解除妇女在生产中所遇到的困难。但当地妇联对于该地可能而且必需举办的妇女生产事业，则又应主动地与有关机关配合进行。
    首先，必须根据各个城市的具体情况，当地人民政府的施政方针及当前中心任务，当时当地市场供求情况，妇女群众原有生产基础及可能，然后确定不同的重点，采取不同的步骤，逐步实现。在女职工多的工业城市或地区，应以女职工及工人家属为主要对象；在女职工极少的工业城市或矿区，除在少数女职工中进行工作外，应以工人家属为主；在非工业城市，女职工及工属都很少，除了对她们进行工作外，则应以家庭劳动妇女为主要对象。一般说，各城市要在有重点地恢复和发展生产的总方针指导之下，对在业的女工，主要是进行宣传教育，以提高思想觉悟，发扬生产积极性，增加产量，改进质量，学习技术，参加生产竞赛，并解除参加生产中所遇到的特殊困难和思想障碍。妇联在进行女职工和工属工作时，应在工会统一领导之下，分工合作，妇联与工会有关部门的关系上，曾存在某些不协调的现象，今后应从思想上、组织上、工作作法上作适当的解决。
    凡有失业女工的城市应根据政务院救济失业工人的指示，适当地争取女工能和同样条件的男工受到政府所规定的同等救济待遇。在可能条件下参加以工代赈，生产自救，转业训练等同等机会。对有些地区主办失业救济工作中歧视失业半失业女工的现象，要与主管有关机关商同纠正。此外更应对失业女工加以适当的教育和训练。凡在灾区的城市妇联，主要的紧急任务是救灾，并以生产与救灾结合。
    对于组织家庭劳动妇女参加手工业生产，目前，仍是必要和可能的。现在妇女已参加的手工业生产，其中一部分是有前途的。同时，必须明确认识组织妇女手工业生产的方针，应是重点恢复和发展，而非普遍恢复和发展，要实事求是，从点滴做起，从长远发展计划着眼。具体努力的主要方向，有如下五个：
    一、同公私营工厂结合，组织妇女，在厂内或厂外做辅助性的手工业加工生产。
    二、组织妇女参加可供外销的特种手工艺品的生产，或外销的工农产物的加工生产，前者如挑补花、花边抽纱、草帽辫、磁器等手工业，后者如捡核桃、捡大豆、捡猪鬃等类。
    三、面向农村，组织妇女参加合于农民需要的手工业生产品。
    四、组织妇女参加各机关、学校、团体的职员的日常生活品的生产或加工，如缝洗衣服等。
    五、在组织妇女生产中要特别注意维持和恢复过去已有生产基础，现在仍易恢复，目前无须巨额投资，可以主要依靠推销周转，自行解决资金者。
    根据过去的经验，妇联应采用的作法，有以下五点：
    一、与政府的财政经济机关、合作社、公私工厂等密切配合，根据他们已定的生产方针、计划和具体步骤，协助他们组织和教育妇女参加生产，以提高生产效能和成品质量，实现政府的生产计划。要求他们帮助妇女开辟生产门路，解决妇女生产中的困难。妇联应主动地与上述财经机关及公私企业等有关的团体配合。配合的方法从遇事协商，进到争取参加有关的会议和有关的组织（如察哈尔省有生产统一组织，并有经常会议），在统一领导之下，分工合作，协同前进。
    二、走群众路线，集合群众自己的游资，运用群众自己的经验来找寻生产的道路，解决成品推销的困难。经验证明，这是比单凭少数干部，到处奔波，到处碰壁的办法好得多。
    三、应该提倡“靠山吃山，靠水吃水”，“就地取材，有啥搞啥”的原则，组织多种多样的经常的或临时的生产，尽可能地从各方面解决妇女群众的困难。不能企图一次搞一两种大规模生产来解决多数人的生产和生活问题。
    四、应坚持劝导妇女学习技术，提高技术，改进成品质量。提倡无技术或技术差的劳动妇女要学习技术并与有技术的男工配合，男女分工合作，完成生产任务。尤要严格纠正从救济恩赐观点出发，迁就群众的落后性。必须明定生产规格，实行严格的检验制度，力求提高成品质量。
    五、要采用不拘大小的多种多样的形式，组织妇女生产，而最基本的是以行业为单位的手工业生产合作组织。从事各该行业的妇女，可参加该行业的合作社或劳动互助组。这种合作社目前以统一领导分散经营为合宜，集体生产要在一定条件下才能组织与维持。过去有些城市，单纯组织妇女的手工业生产合作社，或者勉强把家庭手工业者组织起来集体生产，其效果大多是失败的。此外，根据目前城市合作社发展的情况及城市妇女群众的要求来看，应重视组织妇女参加消费合作社。
    为着贯彻上述方针任务，必须使生产与文化、政治教育相结合，又要适当地解除妇女参加生产的障碍及其特殊的封建束缚。为此，各城市妇联应更加努力协助人民政府及有关各方面推进儿童保育、妇幼卫生及贯彻新婚姻法等工作。
    今后开展儿童保育事业的方向，要更进一步为广大体力劳动者、脑力劳动者及其子女服务，更多地帮助她们举办各种各样的保育机构和幼稚园。在女职工较多的工业城市，首先要整顿或增设工厂的保育机构和幼稚园。在非工业城市，则应着重帮助女教职员举办保育机构和幼稚园。在各城市女工、工人家属及家庭劳动妇女中，应广为宣传育儿知识，新育儿法。在近郊可试办农忙托儿所。举办保育机构的原则，必须根据今天劳动人民的生活水平，经济能力，及有关各方面人力、财力、父母需要、子女利益来决定托儿所的收托时间、生活标准、设备规模等。以办小规模的半托为主，或在可能时试办全托。总之，力求运用现有的人力、财力，举办各种各样的托儿所，为更多的孩子服务。不能企图用一种标准，统一各种托儿所。至于解决托儿所人力财力的办法，目前首先是提倡各有关工厂、矿区、机关、学校行政方面，工会及父母们协力创办。其次，要提倡社会热心儿童事业，公益事业的人士，出钱、出力、出技术、出主意，兴办各种保育机构。对于私人举办的保育事业，应作可能的扶助，使之逐渐发展，不应兼并排挤。为着适应当前的需要，应尽可能培养或训练保育干部，团结教育改造原有的保教人员。
    妇幼卫生工作的重点，在工业城市应放在产业女工及工人家属中，首先要保证贯彻劳保条例中规定的妇幼的待遇，并在可能条件下，增添工厂的妇幼卫生人员，改善卫生设备，解决当前可能解决的若干问题。在非工业城市中，重点应放在贫苦劳动妇女方面。为着做好这工作应该团结教育原有的妇幼卫生的医护人员（首先是数量较多的助产士），并改造旧产婆和培养新的妇幼卫生干部，这是开展妇幼卫生工作的必须的、宝贵的资本。此外，妇联应广为宣传妇幼卫生常识，反对迷信落后的接生方法和治疗方法。经验证明，这种宣传工作很受群众欢迎，对增进妇幼健康，能起一定的作用。
    不少城市的事实证明，已未婚的女工及各阶层妇女，深受旧式婚姻压迫与痛苦，以至妨碍生产情绪，有损健康。各地妇联应大力协助政府贯彻中华人民共和国婚姻法，要长期地开展婚姻法的宣传教育工作，做到家喻户晓。在必要与可能时，妇联应参加婚姻案件的陪审，列席和旁听，调解家庭纠纷，反对虐待及迫害妇女，特别是阻碍妇女参加生产等行为，有步骤地消灭束缚妇女的封建传统习俗。
    （二）工作方法问题
    城市工作的方法，首先必须把过去长期养成的农村观点，和一揽子的工作方法，加以切实的彻底的转变，而代之以集中统一的整体思想和分工合作的科学方法。既是统一的领导，又要明确的分工，既有主管的机关，又要有协助的方面。主管机关对其主管之业务，固应积极负责，而协同配合的机关，亦应努力参加，分工合作，协同推进。不是争领导，争成绩谁属，而是一切应从人民利益，从整体利益出发。
    妇联会的工作性质范围是广泛复杂的，但主要的是结合当地人民政府的中心任务，有步骤、有重点、有计划地进行工作，一方面依据人民政府的方针政策，在妇女群众中进行宣传、组织、教育等工作；另一方面向人民政府反映妇女群众的要求与意见，协助人民政府确定有关妇女儿童工作的方针计划，改进工作，监督执行。并在必要时向政府有关部门请示协商，为着完成某一件具体工作，可建议政府有关部门建立联席会议，争取派代表参加政府的有关组织，或在政府之下组织某一工作的临时或经常的机构。
    因此，凡属于妇联主管的工作，则须主动与有关机关协同合作，凡属于其他机关主管的，妇联亦应主动配合协同推进。根据当地的人民政府的建设计划，当地的中心工作，估计客观的条件及妇联主观的力量，分别轻重、主次、先后、缓急，采取具体的、组织的、工作的步骤，不只限于个别暂时的配合，而应逐渐达到一定的经常的合作联系与可能的适当的组织形式。必须纠正“样样配合”失去中心，“到处配合”分散力量，陷于被动的作法。
    分工合作，相互配合的工作方法，在我们干部的思想上已开始明确并逐渐肯定，工作上亦有若干改进，必须坚持下去。但现在有些妇女工作干部“怕麻烦、怕碰钉子、不愿与有关各方面协商配合”，而企图干脆由妇联单独的搞一套，否则就取消妇女团体和单独的妇女工作，而并入人民政府、人民团体的有关部门去做。这两种想法都不是从今天中国的国情出发，没有认识妇女既有和本阶级男子相同的要求，同时还有特殊的要求；既需要单独的妇女团体和妇女工作，又须要和有关各方面协同合作；还要通过各种工作岗位的女干部去推进妇女工作。只有这样，才能主动地、有目的地和有关各方面配合。如果违反这种特性，硬求工作痛快，结果是徒自苦恼，于事无补的。同时要求各方面领导机关及各种岗位上的女干部，亦要把解放妇女贯彻男女平等的政策，引以为己任。
    （三）关于妇女群众的组织问题
    根据目前中国的国情和妇女的特殊情况，即使有了各人民团体、各行各业及生产、合作、文化等具体工作的组织，还是不够的。还需要一个一般的单独的妇女组织，“以便领导和推动妇女工作，团结和教育广大妇女群众，经常为妇女服务。”因此，民主妇女联合会的组织还有存在的必要。不仅不应有取消妇女工作的思想和做法，而且要加强起来，把妇女工作提到更高、更广、更重要的地位，以适应目前革命已取得全国决定性的胜利的需要。面向全中国广大妇女群众，引导她们同男子一起参加新中国的各种建设事业。妇女群众的组织，应该是广泛的，而不是严密的，因为过于严密，就不能广泛地联系广大妇女群众进行工作。为此中国第一次妇女代表大会曾指出：必须改进妇女的组织状况、改进妇联与妇女群众的联系，运用妇女代表会议这一组织形式，去组织妇女群众。经验证明，城乡的各种妇女代表会议确实合乎目前中国妇女的觉悟程度和组织水平的，是能更广泛、更民主、更灵活地联系妇女群众的一个主要的、最好的组织形式；它通过无数的代表作纽带，使领导与群众相结合。
    妇女代表会议，有按地区组织的一般综合性的，有按各种职业组织单一的职业性的。前者可由妇联召集，后者由妇联与各该职业的组织协商，或由各该职业组织机构的妇女部门召集。各职业的妇女代表会议的组织，是属于各该职业组织的一个组成部分，但同时又可选出代表参加该地区一般综合的妇女代表会议。各职业的妇女代表会议的任务，是要在各该职业妇女中“加一把力”，帮助其解决某些特殊问题，从而加强该职业男女人员的团结，更好地完成该职业团体的中心任务。区域的妇女代表会议，乃是讨论解决一般妇女的共同的特殊问题，进行宣传组织并推广妇女工作，传达与执行人民政府的法令政策，参加民主建政，成为人民政府的有力的助手。这样做，既可纠正忽视妇女特殊利益的偏向，又可避免孤立突出的做法。各地妇联应认真切实地通过妇女代表会议去扩大与有组织的和无组织的妇女群众的联系，要成为经常运用的主要形式，而不是偶然的，或临时的运用一下。市、县以上的妇女代表会议，可定期召开，市、县以下的妇女代表会议，应更灵活，有事需要就可召开，无事就可以不开。召开各种妇女代表会议，要做必要的准备。要把会议开好，既要有中心议题，又要广泛讨论，要发扬民主、集思广益、进行批评与自我批评，但时间不宜太长，每次集中解决一、二个必要而可能解决的问题。会后要重视组织传达，并检查执行情形。
    一年来经验证明在三十万人口以上的大、中城市，可组织区级民主妇女联合会，或有些城市已采用的各种区级妇女工作机构（如市民主妇联驻区办事处，街道妇女代表会联合办事处等等）。三十万人口以下的城市可不成立区级妇联，由市妇联直接领导区街妇女代表会议。在多民族地区的城市，可依各民族的自愿，采用混合组织形式或该民族的单一组织形式，以利增进民族感情，促进民族团结。
    各级民主妇联，均为团体会员制，不采用个人会员制。如遇个别妇女要求加入妇联时，可介绍其加入所属行业组织或其他个人会员制的妇女团体。
    （四）更加强扩大各阶层妇女的团结
    从中华全国民主妇女联合会起到各地各级民主妇女联合会，都是在工人阶级领导下，以工农劳动妇女为基础，团结小资产阶级妇女、民族资产阶级妇女及一切爱国民主妇女的最广泛的统一战线组织；因此民主妇联的各级组织，从基层组织一直到上层领导机构，都必须贯串这种精神，要尽可能团结当地的各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派及无党派的民主妇女，参加各级组织、各种工作、一直到领导工作。这种统一战线的政策，是适合中国国情之需要，又是中国革命基本特点之一，是长期的，不是暂时的，不仅是全国妇联要如此做，而是各级妇联都应一致执行的。但在实际上，各级妇联在开始时一般的认识模糊，未加注意，重视不够，目前有些妇联已逐渐较前注意，有些已有所改进，而一般的仍相当普遍地存在着严重的关门主义倾向。
    今后各级妇联应根据毛主席的指示，四个朋友密切合作，对准三个敌人斗争。必须分清敌友，对待敌友应有基本区别。对待朋友要一视同仁，在工作、学习、待遇方面要一样，根据同一标准处理问题。为此，对于妇女统一战线工作，必须加强重视，广泛的团结各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各种宗教信仰及其他一切的爱国民主妇女，认真切实地进行统一战线的工作，在人民政协共同纲领、全国第一次妇女代表大会决议及民主妇女联合会章程的基础之上，善于运用批评与自我批评的武器，贯彻政策。从组织上，工作上充实与扩大妇女统一战线。在多民族的地区，尤应注意贯彻民族政策。我们要勇于展开妇女方面的统一战线工作，各民族、各党派与无党派的妇女要互相尊重，打破疑虑，推诚相见，遇事协商，有职有权，做好工作，共求进步。而经常的具体工作与学习组织，是丰富妇女统一战线的内容和具体开展统一战线工作的重要步骤。我们既要对敌人提高警惕，又必须克服妇女统一战线工作中的关门主义倾向，和无原则的迁就倾向，反对把统一战线的工作内容降低到仅是感情联络，交际应酬的庸俗认识和做法。
    （五）宣传教育工作
    一切革命工作和新鲜事物，在其开始唤醒群众的注意时，要经过一定的发展过程，才能成为群众的思想行动，产生巨大力量。每一个新发生的问题，从其开始提出，到达成熟解决的过程，都是首先从宣传、解释、教育着手，而继之以有系统的宣传工作。要实现男女平等的政策，妇女解放的事业，几乎每一步骤都必须结合宣传教育工作，才能更好地推进工作。特别是由于中国封建传统遗留下来的重男轻女的思想残余尚未肃清，要使轻忽妇女工作转为重视妇女工作，更需要用事实、讲道理、根据共同纲领和男女平等的政策结合当地中心工作进行长期的、不疲倦的宣传解释与教育工作。妇女解放运动即是一个教育运动，而在实际上使她们逐渐走上生产建设的道路。因此，宣传教育工作是妇女工作中重要的不可缺少的部分；同时，又是进入组织妇女群众，推动妇女工作的首要步骤。妇联会不仅应有专门的机构，而且必须把宣传教育工作贯彻到妇联的各种业务、各个工作环节中，唤醒与教育广大妇女群众为参加新中国的建设事业而奋斗。在目前我们首要的宣传内容，是为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转。坚决打破阻碍妇女参加各种劳动生产和社会经济、政治、文化活动的旧思想。逐步组织妇女参加劳动生产和社会经济、政治、文化活动，并解除其特殊困难。一切宣传工作，均应以此为中心。
    我们对于宣传教育工作，一般是不够重视的。有些妇联虽已较前重视，但不完全是有计划有步骤地进行工作，事后也没有及时加以总结。今后特别注意由长期战争转入和平建设、由农村转到城市的不同环境，尽量及时地运用城市的多种多样的宣传工具与便利条件（如报纸、杂志、书籍、戏剧、电影、广播等）和有关机构（如通讯社、民教馆、学校、识字班等）密切配合工作。妇联应定时地供给有关妇女方面的稿件、材料，说明有关妇女工作的问题，以扩大宣传教育工作；并经常交流各地妇女工作的经验，反映妇女群众的要求和问题，从而使妇女工作能广泛展开。目前全国已有三种定期的妇女杂志和由各种日报登载的定期与不定期的妇女副刊二十九种。各主管妇联应加强领导并检讨总结，从编辑方针、方法及副刊内容等各方面提高改进，使之更进一步成为教育和联系组织妇女群众，交流妇女工作经验的园地。
    目前需要有计划、有系统地进行对妇女工作干部的文化的、政治的、业务的教育，特别是训练基层妇女工作干部。为此，各地妇联应在可能条件下举办各种训练班，就地培养县以下的妇女工作干部，县以上的干部由省、大行政区及全国妇联分别训练。
