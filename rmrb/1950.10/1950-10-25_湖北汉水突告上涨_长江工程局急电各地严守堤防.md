　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, October 24th: Due to continuous rainy weather in the Hubei province along the Hanshui River, the water level of the Hanshui River has suddenly risen in recent days. The Baihe water level in the upper reaches of the Hanshui River reached 183.01 meters at 8:00 AM on the 21st, exceeding the highest flood level record of the Hanshui River in that area this year (180.98 meters); the Xiangyang water level rose to 66.56 meters on the 22nd, approaching the highest flood level record of that area this year (67.03 meters). Although the water levels of rivers in the upper reaches began to decline from the 22nd to the 23rd, the discharged floodwaters have gradually threatened the dikes on both sides of the Hanshui River in Hankou City. Currently, in order to overcome the last flood of the Hanshui River, the Middle Yangtze River Engineering Bureau has urgently telegraphed the Jingzhou and Mianyang special districts, along the Hanshui River to all levels of flood control organizations, to heighten vigilance and strictly guard the dikes.

　　湖北汉水突告上涨
    长江工程局急电各地严守堤防
    【新华社汉口二十四日电】湖北省汉水沿岸连日阴雨，汉水水位近日突告上涨。汉水上游白河水位在二十一日上午八时已涨达一八三点零一公尺，突破该地汉水本年最高洪水位纪录（一八零点九八公尺）；襄阳水位在二十二日上涨到六六点五六公尺，接近该地今年最高洪水位纪录（六七点零三公尺）。二十二日至二十三日上游各河水位虽开始下降，但下泄的洪水已逐渐威胁汉口市汉水两岸堤防。目前长江中游工程局为战胜汉水最后一次洪水，已急电荆州、沔阳两专区沿汉水各地各级防汛组织提高警惕，严密守护堤防。
