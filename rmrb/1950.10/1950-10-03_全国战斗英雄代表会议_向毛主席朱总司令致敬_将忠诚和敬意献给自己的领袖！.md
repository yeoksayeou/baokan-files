　　National Combat Heroes Representative Conference
　　Pays Respects to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu
　　Dedicating Loyalty and Respect to Our Leaders!
　　[Our Newspaper's Report] The National Combat Heroes Representative Conference passed a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. The telegram reads as follows:

　　Beloved and Great Leader Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

　　This time, we have gathered from all directions and different defense lines in the people's capital to participate in the National Combat Heroes and Labor Models Representative Conference. At the same time, we have the opportunity to meet the great leader Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. This is the greatest joy of our lives. Before coming, many comrades instructed us to send greetings to the leaders in Beijing, to bring the letters of respect from our regiments, companies, and squads to the leaders, and to bring everyone's fighting will and eagerness for instructions to the leaders. Along the way, we were always eagerly hoping to meet Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Upon meeting the leaders, it was as if we had thousands of words that could not be expressed, and we could only cheer from our hearts: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

　　Beloved Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, in the long revolutionary war, it was you who guided our various units to achieve countless significant victories. It was you who guided us to overcome many major difficulties. It was you who guided us to liberate vast areas of land. It was you who guided us to gain the support of the people. It was you who guided us to become a highly conscious and united army. It was you who guided us to strengthen the discipline and democracy of the army, thereby further enhancing our combat effectiveness. In short, we deeply realize at all times that the victory of the Chinese revolution and all military achievements are due to the wise and correct leadership of our Party and you.

　　We, a group of representatives selected by our comrades, have been called models precisely because we have, to a greater or lesser extent, implemented your great summons. First of all, we have understood the fundamental principles of revolution, understood serving the people, and understood hating the enemy. We have also embodied people's war in different positions and embodied the revolutionary traditions of the people's army to varying degrees. All of this is the effect of your military thought on us. Therefore, our achievements and progress have come under your leadership and education, and our glory has also been given to us by the Party and you. If we ignore the leadership of the Party and the great role of all comrades in the army and the people of the whole country, it is a direct violation of your will.

　　In the future, we will certainly continue to implement your wise instructions and strive to build a strong national defense force, so that we not only have a strong army but also a strong air force and a strong navy, consolidate national defense, safeguard world peace, and oppose imperialist aggression. Although the task is arduous, we believe that because we have the correct leadership of the Party and you, our new military construction tasks will certainly be realized, and the struggle against imperialist aggression will certainly be victorious.

　　We assure you that we must abide by your instructions, continue to study hard, learn in combat, learn from the broad masses, strive for progress, and never slacken or become complacent. Among us, some comrades with first and second-degree disabilities are not relaxing their fighting will, and some have experienced hundreds of battles without being proud. All comrades must work harder and strive to be prepared to withstand any new tests.

　　We must abide by your instructions, closely unite with the broad masses, continue to play a leading role, a backbone role, and a bridge role, transform the opinions of the leadership, through the experience of the masses, into the opinions of the masses and the actions of the masses, and strive to complete all the tasks assigned in military construction, combat, production construction, and all work!

　　We dedicate our supreme loyalty and respect to the great leader!

　　We wish Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu eternal health!

　　All Representatives of the National Combat Heroes Representative Conference

　　September 30, 1950

　　全国战斗英雄代表会议
    向毛主席朱总司令致敬
    将忠诚和敬意献给自己的领袖！
    【本报讯】全国战斗英雄代表会议通过向毛主席、朱总司令致敬电，电文如下：亲爱的伟大领袖毛主席和朱总司令：
    这次我们从四面八方各个不同的防线，聚会到人民首都，参加全国战斗英雄和劳动模范代表会议，同时得有机会见到了伟大的领袖毛主席和朱总司令，这是我们平生一次最大的喜庆，临来的时候，许多同志就嘱咐过我们，要我们到北京向领袖问好，要我们把本团、本连、本班的致敬信带给领袖，把大家的战斗意志和等待指示的心情带给领袖。我们一路上总是热望着见见毛主席和朱总司令，见到了领袖，真好像千言万语没办法说出来，只能从心里欢呼：毛主席万岁！朱总司令万岁！
    亲爱的毛主席和朱总司令，在长期的革命战争中，是您指导着我们各部队取得了无数重大的胜利，是您指导着我们克服了许多重大的困难，是您指导着我们解放了大片大片的地方，是您指导着我们取得了人民的拥护，是您指导着我们成为有高度觉悟的团结一致的军队，是您指导着我们加强了军队的纪律性和民主性，从而更加提高了战斗力。总之，我们无时不深切地体会到：中国革命的胜利，和军事上的一切成就，都由于我们的党和您英明、正确的领导。
    我们这一群由同志们选拔出来的代表，也正因为或多或少地执行了您的伟大的召示，才有了被称作模范的作为。首先我们懂得了革命的根本道理，懂得了为人民服务，懂得了仇恨敌人，我们也从不同的岗位体现了人民战争，在不同的程度上体现了人民军队的革命传统。这都是您的军事思想对于我们的作用。所以，我们的成绩和进步，是在您的领导教育下得来的，我们的光荣，也是党和您给我们的，我们如果忽略了党的领导，忽略了全军同志和全国人民的伟大作用，那正是直接违背了您的意志。
    今后我们一定还要执行您的英明的指示，为建设强大的国防军而奋斗，使我们不仅有一支强大的陆军，而且要有一支强大的空军和一支强大的海军，巩固国防，保卫世界和平，反对帝国主义的侵略。任务虽然是艰巨的，但我们相信，因为有党和您的正确领导，我们新的建军任务，一定会实现，反对帝国主义侵略的斗争一定会胜利。
    我们向您保证，我们一定要遵照您的指示，继续努力学习，在战斗中学习，向广大群众学习，力求进步，决不懈怠，决不骄傲自满，我们当中的同志，有一二等残废还不松懈战斗意志，有的身经百战还不骄傲，所有同志更须努力奋发。准备经受任何新的考验。
    我们一定要遵照您的指示，和广大群众，亲密团结，继续发挥带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用，把领导的意见，通过群众的经验，化为群众的意见和群众的行动，在建军、作战、生产建设和一切工作中，努力完成受领的一切任务！
    我们将至高无上的忠诚和敬意献给伟大领袖！
    我们祝毛主席和朱总司令永远健康！
    全国战斗英雄代表会议全体代表
    一九五○年九月三十日
