[This Dispatch] (By our reporter Cheng Fang): Prominent figures from Christian organizations, schools, and hospitals in Beijing have expressed their thoughts to our reporter regarding the declaration issued by the Christian community.

    Ling Yu Xiu'ai
    Ling Yu Xiu'ai, Chairperson of the Beijing YWCA, said: The publication of this declaration has epoch-making significance in the history of Christian renewal in China. The declaration expresses that we Chinese Christians truly love our motherland, support world peace, and oppose the aggressive war of American imperialism.

    Zhang Tao Ling
    Zhang Tao Ling, Principal of Beijing Chongci Girls' High School, said: We Chinese Christians should achieve self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation. We must never accept or rely on the economic assistance and inducements of imperialist countries, and we must be vigilant against the various vicious schemes of imperialism, especially American imperialism's attempts to sow discord, cultivate reactionary forces, and use the church to collect intelligence about our country. We must promote the Christian spirit of universal love, which, at present, means supporting the Common Program, loving our motherland, opposing the aggressive war launched by American imperialism, and supporting world peace.

    Chen Wenrun
    Chen Wenrun, General Secretary of the Beijing YWCA, said: The publication of this historic document is of particular importance in the current international and domestic situation. Only by thoroughly severing ties with imperialism and embarking on the path of genuine self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation can our Christianity have a future, and only in this way can freedom of belief be achieved. The publication of this document is only the beginning of our Christian renewal movement. Christians nationwide should first pay attention to this document, study it seriously, and mobilize the vast number of believers to sign the declaration to show our Christian faith in and determination for renewal. At the same time, Christians across the country should actively participate in the work of self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation carried out by churches and Christian organizations, and steadily reform Chinese Christianity.

    Zheng Zicheng
    Zheng Zicheng, former Principal of Beijing Muzhen Girls' High School, said: It is a disgrace for Chinese Christianity to have accepted foreign church economic assistance after Christianity was introduced to China. The North China Christian Church once proposed the slogan of self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation and worked hard for it, but it could not be realized during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. At present, this declaration by the Chinese Christian community can help church members recognize the times, raise their awareness, work hard in their own jobs, and strive for the country's construction.

    Gong Huiguang
    Gong Huiguang, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Wangfudajie Consumer Cooperative, said: Chinese Christians are part of the Chinese people and should actively participate in the construction of the Chinese people under the leadership of the People's Government. It is absolutely necessary for Chinese Christianity to break away from the influence of foreign churches and implement self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation. I hope that Christians all over China will unite and work hard to achieve the goals indicated in the declaration.

    Liu Weicheng
    Liu Weicheng, Director of General Affairs of the Beijing Zhonghua Christian Church Daoji Hospital, said: The publication of this declaration is only the beginning of the reform of Chinese Christianity. In the future, we must respond to the call of the declaration with action and mobilize Christians to sign the declaration. In order to transform our Daoji Hospital into a Chinese-style hospital, we carried out hospital administration reform in May this year and achieved self-governance. In terms of economy, we will never rely on foreign economic assistance, but implement self-sufficiency and strict economy to reduce the burden on general patients. This is our Daoji Hospital's goal.

　　就中国基督教界发表宣言事
    京基督教人士发表感想
    认为应和帝国主义彻底割断关系
    【本报讯】本报记者成坊报道：北京市基督教团体、学校、医院知名人士，顷就基督教界发表宣言事，分别向本报记者发表感想。
    凌俞秀霭
    北京基督教女青年会主席凌俞秀霭说：这个宣言的发表，在中国基督教革新史上有划时代的意义。宣言表示我们中国的基督徒真正热爱祖国，拥护世界和平，反对美帝国主义的侵略战争。
    张陶玲
    北京崇慈女中校长张陶玲说：我们中国的基督教应该做到自治、自养、自传，绝不应接受与依赖帝国主义国家的经济接济与利诱，并要警惕帝国主义的各种毒辣阴谋，特别是美帝国主义的挑拨离间、培植反动力量，以及利用教会搜集我们国家的情报。我们要发扬基督教的博爱精神，在目前来说，就是拥护共同纲领，爱护祖国，反对美帝国主义发动侵略战争，拥护世界和平。
    陈文润
    北京基督教女青年会总干事陈文润说：在目前国际国内形势下发表这个具有历史性的文件，是有它特别重要的意义的。我们基督教只有彻底割断与帝国主义的关系，走上真正自治、自养、自传的道路才有前途，也只有这样做，信仰自由才能办到。这个文件的发表，只是我们基督教革新运动的开始。我们全国基督徒首先应该重视这个文件，认真学习这个文件，发动广大信徒在这个宣言上签名，以表示我们基督徒革新的信心和决心。同时，全国的基督徒也应踊跃参加教会及基督教团体所开展的自治、自养、自传的工作，稳步地改革我们中国的基督教。
    郑子澄
    北京慕贞女中前校长郑子澄说：基督教传进中国，接受外国教会经济援助，这是中国基督教的耻辱。华北基督教会在过去曾经提出自治、自养、自传的口号，并为此而努力，但在国民党反动统治时期无法实现。在目前，中国基督教界这个宣言能够帮助教友认清时代，提高觉悟，努力自己的工作，为国家的建设事业而奋斗。
    龚惠光
    北京王府大街消费合作社副理事长龚惠光说：中国基督徒是中国人民一分子，应该在人民政府领导下，积极参加中国人民的建设事业。中国基督教脱离外国教会的影响而实行自治、自养、自传，这是完全必要的。我希望全中国的基督徒团结起来，为实现宣言所指示的目标而努力。
    刘维诚
    北京中华基督教会道济医院总务主任刘维诚说：这个宣言的发表只是中国基督教改革的开始，今后我们要用行动响应宣言的号召，发动基督徒在这个宣言上签名。为把我们道济医院改造成中国型的医院，在今年五月进行了院政改革，实现了自治。在经济方面，我们绝不仰赖于外国的经济援助，实行自给自养，厉行节约，以减轻一般患病者的担负。这就是我们道济医院的奋斗目标。
