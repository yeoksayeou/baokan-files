Greeting the Second World Peace Congress
	Over 150 Million People in China Sign for Peace
	-- Comprehensive Report by Our Journal
    The peace signature campaign, called for by the World Peace Congress Committee, has shown further great development in various provinces and cities of our country in recent days. Riding the high tide of celebrating the first National Day, the number of signatures nationwide has surged by another 20 to 30 million. According to incomplete materials received by the Secretariat of the China Peace Committee, as of October 5th, 155,348,082 people of all nationalities and from all walks of life in China have signed the Stockholm Appeal, accounting for more than 30% of the total national population. This is a great manifestation of the Chinese people's firm will to defend world peace. The enthusiastic mood of the Chinese people in welcoming the Second World Peace Congress is also fully reflected in this number.

    The scale of the Chinese peace signature campaign is so broad and deep that in all cities in our country, almost all adults have participated in this movement. For example, the number of signatures in Wuhan, Hangzhou, Chengdu, Andong, Wuhu, Changzhou, Wuzhou, and other places has accounted for more than 90% of the city's population. The number of signatures in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Fuzhou, Lanzhou, Zhengzhou, Qingdao, Anshan, Lushun-Dalian, Jilin, and other places has exceeded 80% of the city's population. In rural areas, the broad masses of peasants have also plunged into this movement with great enthusiasm. Among the 12,044,000 signatories in Henan Province, more than 10 million are peasants. Even in the sparsely populated and remote Ningxia Province in the Northwest, more than half of the people have signed the peace declaration. The number of peace signatures in Northeast China has accounted for 70% of the region's population. The enthusiastic situation of the peace signature campaign shows that the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world are closely united around the Stockholm Appeal, unanimously opposing atomic weapons that destroy human happiness and any war of aggression, and striving to defend world peace and strive for a better life for mankind.

    In such a broad movement to defend world peace through signatures, various forms of publicity and mobilization have been carried out everywhere, and the people of the whole country have generally received a basic political education. In the peace signature campaign, the people of the whole country unanimously stated that they would take practical actions to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and Tibet to defend world peace and resolutely oppose US imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Korea, as well as its crimes of bombing our Northeast and shelling our merchant ships. After the launch of the peace signature campaign, many factories and villages launched production competitions, and everyone guaranteed to complete production tasks ahead of schedule. After signing, the workers of the carbon plant of the Andong State-owned Machinery Factory greatly improved production, from the past daily production of seven or eight carbon rods to fifteen or sixteen. More than 20 villages in Niuce District, Sishui County, Shandong Province, completed the task of paying public grain within three days. In the signature campaign, countless warriors who actively worked to defend peace emerged everywhere. The training and education they received in the movement have made them good propagandists among the masses, establishing a vast propaganda network for the cause of defending world peace in the future.

    The great contribution made by the Chinese people to the cause of defending world peace in the peace signature movement powerfully tells the warmongers, especially the US imperialists who have repeatedly attempted to invade our territorial sovereignty and expand the Korean War: There is only one future for imperialist aggression, that is, to make the peace-loving people of the world unite more strongly and make the aggressive bandits eventually bury themselves in the flames they have stirred up.

    Now, the peace signature campaign in various provinces and cities across the country is continuing. We believe that the goal of 200 million people signing for peace will definitely be achieved before the Second World Peace Congress.

　　迎接第二次世界保卫和平大会
    中国和平签名超过一亿五千万人 
    ——本刊综合报道
    世界保卫和平大会委员会所号召的和平签名运动，最近几天在我国各省市显出了进一步的巨大发展。全国签名人数，乘着庆祝第一届国庆节的高潮，又激增了两三千万。据中国保卫世界和平大会委员会秘书处所收到的不完全的材料，截至十月五日止，中国各民族各界人民已有一亿五千三百四十八万八千零八十二人在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，占全国人口总数百分之三十以上。这是中国人民保卫世界和平的坚定意志的伟大表现。中国人民迎接第二次世界保卫和平大会的热烈情绪从这一数字上也充分地反映出来了。
    中国和平签名运动的规模是如此广泛和深入，在我国各城市中，几乎所有的成人都已参加到这个运动中来。如武汉、杭州、成都、安东、芜湖、常州、梧州等地的签名人数已占全市人口百分之九十以上，北京、上海、天津、福州、兰州、郑州、青岛、鞍山、旅大、吉林等地的签名人数均已超过全市人口百分之八十。在各地农村，广大农民也以极大的热情投入了这一运动。河南省一千二百零四万四千余人的签名者中，农民即有一千万人以上。甚至西北地广人稀的边远的宁夏省，也已有一半以上的人民在和平宣言上签了名。东北和平签名人数则已占全区人口百分之七十。和平签名运动的热烈情况表明了中国人民和世界上一切爱好和平的人民紧紧地团结在斯德哥尔摩宣言的周围，一致反对毁灭人类幸福的原子武器和任何侵略战争，并为保卫世界和平与争取人类的美好生活而斗争。
    在如此广泛的保卫世界和平签名运动中，各地都展开了各种各样的宣传鼓动工作，全国人民从而普遍地受到了一次基本的政治教育。全国人民在和平签名运动中一致表示：要以支援人民解放军解放台湾、西藏的实际行动来保卫世界和平，坚决反对美帝国主义侵略台湾和朝鲜，以及轰炸我东北与炮击我商船的罪行。许许多多工厂和村庄在和平签名运动展开后发动了生产竞赛，大家保证提前完成生产任务。安东国营机器厂炭素场工人在签名后生产大为提高，从过去每日生产七、八根炭精棒达到十五根至十六根。山东泗水县牛册区二十多个村在三天内完成了缴纳公粮的任务。在签名运动中，各地都涌现了无数为保卫和平积极工作的勇士，他们在运动中所得到的锻炼与教育，已使他们成为群众中良好的宣传员，给今后保卫世界和平事业，建立了广大的宣传网。
    中国人民在和平签名运动方面对保卫世界和平事业所作的伟大贡献，有力地告诉战争贩子，特别是一再企图侵犯我领土主权和扩大朝鲜战争的美帝国主义：帝国主义的侵略行为只有一个前途，那就是使全世界的和平人民更加坚强地团结起来，使侵略强盗最终葬身于自己煽起的火焰之中。
    现在，全国各省市和平签名运动，正在继续进行。我们相信在第二次世界保卫和平大会以前，二万万人和平签名的目标是一定可以达到的。
