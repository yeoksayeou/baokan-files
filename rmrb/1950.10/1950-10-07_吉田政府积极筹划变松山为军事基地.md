Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The reactionary Yoshida government of Japan is actively planning to construct a military base in the Matsuyama City area in the northwest of Shikoku Island. According to a United Press report: Since the outbreak of the Korean War, the Matsuyama branch of the "Daiei Oil Tank" company has been approved to resume operations, and plans to build the Greater Matsuyama Port are actively underway. Construction will begin as soon as the relevant authorities approve it. The core of the military base construction plan in the Matsuyama area is the construction of Matsuyama Port. The total project cost is 750 million Japanese yen. The planned Greater Matsuyama Port covers an area of ​​approximately 3 million tsubo (one tsubo is approximately 3.3 square meters), which is 1 million tsubo larger than Kobe Port, and 10,000-ton ships can freely enter and exit.

The "Daiei Oil Tank" company formulated a plan in mid-August to build the largest oil storage facility on Shikoku Island in Matsuyama, with eleven oil tanks, capable of storing a total of 257,900 barrels of oil. This plan has been approved by the relevant authorities. The first phase of the project is to build nine oil tanks, capable of storing a total of 150,000 barrels of oil, and construction will begin in October. The foundation for the oil storage facility is currently the farmland of farmers in the Okoga Village.

The people of Matsuyama unanimously oppose the construction of a military base in the area. Farmers in Okoga Village have organized to oppose the forced purchase of their farmland as an oil storage facility. Recently, farmers have held many rallies to vigorously carry out their struggle.

　　吉田政府积极筹划变松山为军事基地
    【新华社六日讯】日本吉田反动政府正积极筹划在四国岛西北端的松山市地区建设军事基地。据联合通讯社讯：自从朝鲜战争爆发以来，“大荣油槽”公司松山支店即被批准复业，建设大松山港的计划，正在积极进行中。一俟有关当局批准，即将动工。松山地区军事基地的建设计划中心是建设松山港。总工程费七亿五千万日元。计划中的大松山港占地约三百万坪（一坪约合三·三平方公尺），比神户港还大一百万坪，一万吨级的船舶可以自由出入。
    “大荣油槽”公司已于八月中旬制订计划，准备在松山建造拥有十一座油库的四国岛最大的贮油场，共可贮油二十五万七千九百桶。这一计划已经关系当局批准。第一期工程是建造油库九座，共可贮油十五万桶，将于十月间开工。贮油场的地基，是现在大可贺村农民的耕地。
    松山人民一致反对在该地建设军事基地。大可贺村的农民业已组织起来，反对强迫收买他们的耕地作为贮油场。最近农民曾多次举行集会，强力展开斗争。
