Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 27th -- The 472 workers' reading groups (with more than 4,600 participants) established by Wuxi’s "Su Nan Daily" and "Worker's Life" in July and August have achieved significant results in promoting current affairs education and stimulating production.

During the peace signature campaign, many employees of the Wuxi Xin Yi Cloth Factory did not understand the meaning of the signature campaign, believing that signing a name on white paper was useless. After discussions in the reading groups, all 212 workers in the factory signed the petition. During the week of the movement against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea, many reading group members in factories became active propagandists. After the news of the American plane invading Northeast China's airspace on August 27th was published in the newspaper, reading groups from nine units, including Wuxi railway workers, wrote letters to the newspaper protesting the atrocities of American imperialism and sent letters to the Northeast to express condolences to the affected compatriots.

The reading groups also played a significant role in learning and promoting advanced production experiences. The reading groups often used news about production improvements in the newspaper to study improvement methods based on the actual conditions of their own factories. The Hengfeng Weaving Factory reduced its sub-standard cloth rate from 25 percent to 0.5 percent as a result. Workers in the reading group of the Xiexin Woolen Mill improved their understanding of the fact that trade union work should be production-oriented, and criticized the factory's trade union preparatory committee for paying attention only to welfare and recreational activities, while neglecting leadership in production. The trade union cadres conducted self-criticism based on the workers' opinions, and the trade union work was therefore improved.

The reading groups also provided the newspaper with many suggestions for improving the newspaper, which led to many reforms in the newspaper and increased workers' interest in reading it. As a result, the regular circulation of "Su Nan Daily" and "Worker's Life" increased by 3,213 copies in July and August.

The key to the success of "Su Nan Daily" and "Worker's Life" in launching workers' reading activities is the newspaper's active efforts and the organized promotion of trade unions at all levels. Trade unions at all levels regard the development of workers' reading as a part of the trade union's cultural and educational work. In organizing reading groups, factories adopt different methods according to different production conditions and workers' cultural levels. The more common method is "read, ask, and discuss." Individual factories also promote reporting and singing reports among illiterate workers. In textile factories, where female illiterate workers account for 70 to 80 percent, the method of combining reading and literacy is adopted.

### 苏南日报等组织工人读报组  推动时事教育鼓励积极生产

　　苏南日报等组织工人读报组
    推动时事教育鼓励积极生产
    【新华社上海二十七日电】无锡《苏南日报》和《工人生活》在七、八两月建立起来的四百七十二个工人读报组（参加读报的共四千六百余人），对时事教育和推动生产获得不少成绩。
    在和平签名运动中，无锡新毅布厂曾有很多职工不认识签名运动的意义，他们以为白纸写黑字，签个名没啥用场。经过读报组漫谈以后，全厂二百十二个工人都签了名。在反对美国侵略台湾、朝鲜运动周中，很多工厂的读报组员多成为积极的宣传员。美机八月二十七日侵犯东北领空的消息在报纸上登出后，当天就有无锡铁路工人等九个单位的读报组写信给报社，抗议美帝国主义的暴行，并去信东北慰问受难同胞。
    读报组在学习和推广先进生产经验方面，也起了很大的作用。读报组常根据报上改进生产的新闻，联系本厂实际情况，研究改进办法。恒丰织布厂曾因此使次布率由百分之二十五降到百分之零点五。协新毛织厂读报组的工人，在读报中提高了对工会工作应面向生产的认识，批评了该厂工会筹备会只注意福利和文娱工作，而忽视领导生产的偏向。该厂工会干部即根据工人的意见进行了自我检讨，工会工作因而得到改进。
    读报组还向报社提供了许多改进报纸的意见，使报纸进行了许多改革，因而增加了工人读报的兴趣。七、八两月《苏南日报》和《工人生活》的经常发行量便因此增加了三千二百十三份。
    无锡《苏南日报》和《工人生活》开展工人读报工作获得成绩的主要关键是报社的主动努力和各级工会有组织的推动。各级工会都把开展工人读报的工作看做是工会文化教育工作的一部分。各厂在组织读报组中，按照不同生产情况和工人文化水平，采用不同的办法。其中较普遍的是“一读、二问、三讨论”的读报方法。个别厂并在文盲工人中提倡讲报、唱报。在女工文盲占百分七、八十的纺织工厂中，则采用读报和识字结合的办法。
