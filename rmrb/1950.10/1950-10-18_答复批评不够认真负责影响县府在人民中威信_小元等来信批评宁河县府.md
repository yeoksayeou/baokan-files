　　Replying to Criticism Insufficiently Responsible, Affecting County Government's Prestige Among the People
    Xiao Yuan and Others Write to Criticize Ninghe County Government
    After the Tianjin Progressive Daily published the Ninghe County People's Government's reply to reader Guan Yiwu's criticism on September 11th, this newspaper received two letters from readers criticizing the Ninghe County People's Government's reply. The original reply and the readers' letters are published together below.
        — Editor
    Letter from Ninghe Cooperative Cadres, etc., to the Editor:
    The Ninghe County People's Government's reply to reader criticism published on the social services page of the Tianjin Progressive Daily on September 11th does not conform to the actual situation. This shows that the leading cadres of the Ninghe County government are not working thoroughly and are not responsible enough to the people.
    Corruption problems have long existed in the Lutai Collective Committee, but the county government has never deeply understood this issue. When the Collective Committee was established, the Tax Bureau called on traders to supervise the leadership's work. Therefore, military family member Su Xiangchen and martyr's family member Zhang Xinpu actively put forward their opinions. Unexpectedly, they were dismissed because of this. However, Zhao Jiyong and Zhang Xueqian, the director and vice director of the Collective Committee, who were corrupt, pretended to be active, and deceived their superiors, were deeply trusted by their superiors. For example, when Zhang Xueqian was detained, the person in charge of the Tax Bureau pleaded for him, asking the court to release him as soon as possible. Therefore, the traders in the Collective Committee often complained in their conversations: "Good people still can't get ahead! Corrupt people who commit mistakes can be forgiven, and they are released after being detained for a few days. Those who actively offer opinions are dismissed and lose their jobs."
    Although the Ninghe County Government has listed the facts of corruption in the Collective Committee in its reply to the Progressive Daily's readers, it also said that the opinions of the people "completely do not conform to the facts and even contain some slanderous elements." This attitude has greatly damaged the government's prestige among the people.
    We believe that the Ninghe County Government should deeply examine its own mistakes, reinvestigate and deal with this matter, and earnestly improve its future work.
                Three Traders from the Lutai Collective Committee
                Two Cadres from the Ninghe Cooperative
    Letter from Comrade Xiao Yuan to the Editor:
    On the social service page of the Tianjin Progressive Daily on September 11th, I read a reply from the Ninghe County People's Government to the criticism of Lutai's Guan Yiwu. I think that the Ninghe County Government is very lacking in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism in handling this issue. Now I will tell you my opinion.
    Stalin instructed us: “Even if criticism from below only includes 5% to 10% of the truth, such criticism should be welcomed, carefully listened to, and the healthy core should be grasped.” However, the Ninghe County Government replied to the reader's criticism without any humility, using words such as "After investigation, we believe that some of the opinions reflected by the reader are completely inconsistent with the facts, and even contain some defamatory components."
    What is the truth? The Progressive Daily did not publish Guan Yiwu's original letter, and the Ninghe County Government did not point out what was inconsistent with the facts and what was defamatory, so I dare not speculate. But even from the Ninghe County Government's reply alone, one can see a part of the truth and see that the reply is not honest.
    The reply stated that military family member Su Xiangchen and martyr's family member Zhang Xinpu accused Zhao Jiyong and Zhang Xueqian, the director and vice director of the Lutai Collective Committee, of corruption and cited three facts. However, the result of the Lutai County Court's trial was: the first item "was not embezzled, but was still stored in the cabinet, but was not announced publicly." The second item had slight discrepancies in the amount, and the money had been used to "help a poor trader, but was not announced." The third item was embezzlement, but the punishment was not cloth but money. The embezzlers were detained for a few days and then released; and those who exposed the embezzlement were "criticized and educated" because "some of them were not in line with reality."
    Obviously, those who should be "criticized and educated" should not be those who exposed the embezzlement, but the Ninghe County Government. The slight discrepancies in the amount and other situations are fundamental issues. The money was stored up but "not announced publicly," and public funds were privately misappropriated but "not announced," which is obviously still worthy of in-depth study; even if the facts are really like this and the accusers misunderstood, the responsibility should be borne by those who "did not announce it publicly."
    Even more unreasonable is that the Ninghe County Government first affirmed in its reply that the accusers were retaliating. Whether the accusers' motives were retaliation, I do not know. But the center of the problem is whether there was embezzlement.
    This incident reminds me of another problem: in our organs and among our cadres, there are still some people who are "painted" and hope to "wave away self-criticism." But under the supervision of the Party, the government, and the masses of the people, they cannot openly suppress and reject criticism. Therefore, they treat criticism with a very dishonest attitude. Just like the Ninghe County Government, the criticism was received, it was said to have been "investigated," and it was also publicly replied to; but in essence, it was still suppressing and rejecting criticism.
    This situation tells us that there are still many obstacles to launching criticism, and the methods adopted by those who suppress and reject criticism are diverse. In order to correctly launch criticism and self-criticism, all the people—especially the people's newspapers—still need to wage a long-term and irreconcilable struggle against those who suppress criticism.

    Attachment: Reply from the Ninghe County Government to the Progressive Daily Editor:
    Regarding the reader's letter saying that our county court has private feelings and an irresponsible style, and asked us to investigate and deal with it. After investigation, we believe that some of the opinions reflected by the reader are completely inconsistent with the facts, and even contain some defamatory components. The truth of our investigation is listed below:
    1.  What happened
    The plaintiffs, Lutai Su Xiangchen (military family member) and Zhang Xinpu (martyr's family member), were traders who were eliminated. They were eliminated because they were not active in their work, so they accused Zhao Jiyong and Zhang Xueqian, the director and vice director of the Lutai Collective Committee, of corruption with a retaliatory nature; but although it was a somewhat retaliatory accusation, some of the corruption was correct. The details of their accusations are listed below: 1. Zhao embezzled 17,000 yuan of tax reward for fining merchant Li Sui; 2. Zhao embezzled 186,150 yuan of the 519,000 yuan for fining Shao Yunsheng for tax evasion, as Director Zhao only took out 70,000 yuan; 3. Xiao Yonggui and Liu Yongtian seized two pieces of cloth from tax evasion, and the reward they received (calculated at 35%) was embezzled by Directors Zhao and Zhang.
    2.  Trial process
    After the court accepted the case, it invited the Tax Bureau and the Industry and Commerce Section of the County Government to sit in on the trial (they attended every trial). After the court summoned witnesses and conducted in-depth investigations, the facts of corruption were as follows: 1. The plaintiff accused Li Sui of embezzling 17,000 yuan of the fine. The person did not embezzle the funds and they were still stored in the cabinet, but were not announced publicly; 2. Of the 519,000 yuan in tax fines for Shao Yunsheng, there was also more than 170,000 yuan in supplementary tax (no reward for supplementary tax), and the double fine was more than 340,000 yuan. Calculated at 35%, the reward should be more than 121,000 yuan. Zhao and Zhang took out 70,000 yuan, and the remaining 51,000 yuan was used to help a poor trader, but was not announced; 3. Xiao Yonggui and Liu Yongtian seized not two large pieces of cloth, but more than 180,000 yuan, and the reward was more than 60,000 yuan, but this reward was not given to the traders (Xiao and Liu), and Zhang Xueqian put it into his own pocket (the reason for the detention and crime).
    In addition, in the in-depth investigation, it was learned that Zhao Jiyong extorted money from the traders, each time from 1,000 to 3,000 yuan (reflected by traders on duty); ... In addition, small merchant Cui Xueyi gave Zhao Jiyong three dou of millet as a gift.
    3.  Handling results
    When dealing with this issue, the results were discussed jointly by the relevant departments. Zhang Xueqian was detained for 18 days, and the embezzled reward was returned to the traders Xiao and Liu, and they were released after being announced and educated at the conference. Zhao Jiyong was detained for 39 days. Because Cui Xueyi, who gave the rice, went to the Northeast and it is not known when he will return, it was inconvenient to detain him for a long time, so Zhao Jiyong was ordered to be released on bail pending investigation. In addition, the plaintiffs' accusations were not in line with the facts, and they were also criticized and educated.

### 答复批评不够认真负责影响县府在人民中威信  小元等来信批评宁河县府

　　答复批评不够认真负责影响县府在人民中威信
    小元等来信批评宁河县府
    九月十一日天津进步日报刊载了宁河县人民政府对读者管亦吾批评的答复后，本报收到读者来信两封，对宁河县人民政府的答复提出批评。现将答复原文及读者来信一并发表于后。
        ——编者
    宁河合作社干部等来信编辑同志：
    九月十一日天津进步日报社会服务版发表了宁河县人民政府对读者批评的答复。这个答复是不符合实际情况的。这说明宁河县政府领导干部工作不深入，对人民不够负责。
    在芦台集委会中长期存在着贪污问题，而县政府对这个问题始终没有深入了解。在集委会成立时，税务局曾号召交易员监督领导工作。因此，军属苏相臣、烈属张新圃就积极提出意见。不料他们竟因此而被开除。而集委会主任赵纪永、张学谦两人贪污腐化、假装积极、欺瞒上级，反而深得上级信任。如张学谦被扣押时，税务局负责人曾替他说情，请法院早日释放。因此，集委会交易员们在谈话中常发牢骚说：“好人还是吃不开呀！贪污腐化的人犯了错误却可以原谅，押了几天就放出来了。积极提意见的却被开除，失了业。”
    宁河县政府在对进步日报读者的答复中，虽然已列举了集委会的贪污事实，但又说人家的意见“完全不符合事实，甚至包含一部分诽谤的成分”。这种态度，使政府在人民群众中的威信受到很大的损失。
    我们认为：宁河县政府应深刻检讨自己的错误，重新调查处理这件事情，并认真改进今后工作。
                芦台集委会交易员三人
                宁河合作社干部二人
    小元同志来信编辑同志：
    在九月十一日天津进步日报社会服务版上，我读到了一则宁河县人民政府对芦台管亦吾批评的答复。我觉得宁河县政府在这个问题的处理上是十分缺乏批评和自我批评的精神的。现在我把我的意见向你们谈一谈。
    斯大林指示我们：来自下面的批评，“即令批评只包括着百分之五到百分之十的真理，那末就是这种批评也应该欢迎，细心地倾听，抓住其中健全的核心。”但是宁河县政府对读者批评的答复，却毫不虚心地用“经调查后，我们以为该读者所反映的若干条意见，是完全不符合事实，甚至其中包含一部分诽谤的成分。”这样的话打了回去。
    事实究竟怎样呢？进步日报没有发表管亦吾的原信，宁河县政府也没指出那些是不符合事实、那些是诽谤，我不敢揣测。但是即使单从宁河县政府的答复来看，也就可以看出事实真相之一部，也就可以看出答复之不老实。
    答复中说：军属苏相臣、烈属张新圃控告芦台集委会主任赵纪永、张学谦贪污，并举出三项事实。但芦台县法院审理结果是：第一项款“并未贪污，还在柜上存着，但并未当众发表”。第二项款数稍有出入，款已用来“救济一贫苦交易员，但未公布”。第三项是贪污了，但罚的不是布而是钱。贪污者被羁押了几天之后释放了；而揭发贪污者因“有的不符合实际”，而受到“批评教育”。
    很明显，应该受到“批评教育”的不应是揭发贪污者，而应是宁河县政府。款数稍有出入等情况，根本是枝节问题。钱存起来而“未当众发表”，公款被私自挪用而“但未公布”，显然尚值得深入研究；即使事实果真如此，而控告者是误会了，责任亦应由“未当众发表”者来负。
    更无理由的，是宁河县府在答复中首先肯定控告者是为了报复。控告者动机是否报复，我不得而知。但问题的中心在于是否贪污。
    这个事件使我联想到另一个问题：在我们机关、干部中，还存在着某些“涂了漆的”、希望“挥开自我批评”的人。但他们在党、政府和人民群众的监督下，不能公开地压制、拒绝批评。于是，就用一种很不老实的态度来对待批评。就像宁河县府那样，批评收到了，据说已“调查”了，并且也公开答复了；但实质上，却还是压制、拒绝了批评。
    这个情况告诉我们：展开批评的障碍还是很多的，压制、拒绝批评者所采取的方式是多样的。为了正确地展开批评和自我批评，全体人民——尤其是人民的报纸还需要和压制批评者作长期的、不调和的斗争。
              小元
    附宁河县府给进步日报的答复编辑同志：
    关于读者投书说我县法院有私人感情，及对人民不负责的作风，并让我们调查处理。经调查后，我们以为该读者所反映的若干条意见，是完全不符合事实，甚至其中包含一部分诽谤成份。兹将我们调查的真象列下：
    一、发生的情况
    原告芦台苏相臣（军属）张新圃（烈属）是被洗刷的交易员，他们因为工作不积极而被洗刷，于是带着报复的性质，控告芦台集委会主任赵纪永、张学谦二人贪污；但虽属有些报复性的控告，贪污也有部分正确的。兹将其控告情况列下：一、罚行商李绥税款提奖一万七千元自己贪污；二、罚邵云生漏税五十一万九千元，提奖十八万六千一百五十元，而赵主任只拿出七万元，下余贪污；三、萧永桂、刘永田缉着逃税罚款二个布，所提奖（按百分之三十五提）被赵、张主任贪污。
    二、审理经过
    法院受理此案后，即邀请税务局、县政府工商科旁听陪审（每次审讯均旁听），经法院传讯证人及深入调查，其贪污事实如下：一、原告控告李绥之罚款提款一万七千元，该人并未贪污，还在柜上存着，但并未当众发表；二、罚邵云生税款五十一万九千元，其中还有补税十七万元多（补税不提奖），罚税两倍三十四万余，按百分之三十五计算应提奖十二万一千多，赵、张二人拿出七万，下余五万一千元救济一贫苦交易员，但未公布；三、萧永桂、刘永田缉私不是罚二个大布，而是罚十八万余元，提奖六万余元，但此提奖未发给交易员（萧、刘），而张学谦入自己私囊（羁押之犯罪原因）。
    另外在深入调查中，了解出赵纪永向交易员勒索钱每次一千至三千元（在职交易员反映）；……另外有小商贩崔学义送给赵纪永三斗小米的礼。
    三、处理结果
    在处理此问题时，是各有关部门共同研讨结果，将张学谦羁押十八日，将吃私的提奖归还交易员萧、刘二人，并在大会公布教育释放。赵纪永羁押三十九日，因送米的崔学义去东北，不知何时回来，不便久押，所以令赵纪永保外候调查处理。此外，对原告人之控告有的不符合事实，亦对其批评教育。
