　　Learning of Comrade Bishi's passing with great shock, I extend my deepest condolences. Comrade Bishi's great spirit of loyal dedication to the cause of the Chinese people's revolution for the past thirty years will forever inspire us to forge ahead courageously. We pledge to work even harder to better fulfill the glorious and arduous tasks entrusted to us by the people. Comrade Bishi will live forever!

    Pure in character, loyal to the Party, humble and prudent, with a comprehensive understanding of the overall situation, he is a model for us.
    Thirty years of struggle, tempered by hardship, having reached maturity, he suddenly passed away, a cause for grief for the entire Party.
