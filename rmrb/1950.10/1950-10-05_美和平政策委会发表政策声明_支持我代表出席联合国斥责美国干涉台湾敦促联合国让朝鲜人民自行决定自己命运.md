Xinhua News Agency, New York, 2nd: According to TASS from New York on the 2nd, the National Executive Board of the American "Peace Policy Committee," established in Chicago in May this year, held a meeting in New York on September 27th and 28th, and unanimously adopted the organization's policy statement.

　　The statement urged the United Nations to issue an order for an immediate ceasefire in Korea, not to allow the undemocratic Syngman Rhee clique to seize power, and to allow the Korean people to "decide their own destiny." The statement pointed out the necessity of US-Soviet consultation, condemned US interference in Taiwan, and urged that representatives of the People's Republic of China be allowed to attend the United Nations.

　　The statement said: We strongly advocate that the United Nations should become an instrument for resolving all international crises by peaceful means - negotiation and mediation. We believe that allowing representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the Fifth UN General Assembly now would infinitely strengthen the organization, make it more truly representative, and better able to fulfill its tasks. The statement insisted: The United Nations immediately issue an order for a ceasefire in Korea; undemocratic governments such as the Syngman Rhee regime should not be allowed to be established; Korea should be unified under the guarantee of a truly representative United Nations and have the right to decide its own form of government. It should be allowed to decide its own destiny.

　　The statement continued: We deeply regret the unilateral actions taken by the United States government and military leaders toward Taiwan. Taiwan has always been Chinese territory, and governments around the world have recognized it as such. We oppose initiating such actions that endanger peace.

　　The statement urged the United Nations to resume negotiations on the use and control of atomic energy and to conduct discussions on universal disarmament, and pointed out that the war economy has led to a gradual increase in taxes paid by American taxpayers, and the cost of living has risen to new peaks. At the same time, the same changes have occurred in all countries around the world that rely on US dollars. The statement condemned Congress for passing the reactionary Wood-McCarran Act, stating that this act threatens the right to speak, act, or educate for peace. The passage of this bill will turn our country into a vast concentration camp, restrict our thinking, and isolate our country from free contact with the rest of the world.

　　The statement also pointed out: In the United States, the struggle to win equality and civil rights for 14 million Black people and to oppose the poll tax bill is inseparable from the struggle for peace.

　　In conclusion, the statement stated that the Peace Policy Committee is willing to stand with progressive elements in crisis regions around the world to fight.

　　The members of the Peace Committee include prominent educators, writers, religious and social leaders. They established a permanent peace organization at the Mid-Century Peace Conference held in Chicago on May 30th and 31st this year. More than 700 representatives attended the conference.

　　美和平政策委会发表政策声明
    支持我代表出席联合国斥责美国干涉台湾敦促联合国让朝鲜人民自行决定自己命运
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社纽约二日讯：今年五月在芝加哥成立的美国“和平政策委员会”全国执行局，于九月二十七日及二十八日在纽约举行会议，一致通过了该组织的政策声明。
    声明敦促联合国发布立即在朝鲜停战的命令，不让非民主的李承晚伙帮掌握政权，并容许朝鲜人民“自行决定自己的命运”。声明指出美苏协商的必要，斥责美国干涉台湾。并敦促容许中华人民共和国的代表出席联合国。
    声明称：我们竭力主张：联合国应成为用和平方法——谈判与调解——解决一切国际危机的工具。我们认为：现在让中华人民共和国的代表参加第五届联合国大会，就可以使该组织无限地加强，而且更具有真正的代表性，并更能履行其任务。声明坚持：联合国立即发布在朝鲜停战的命令；象李承晚政权之类的反民主政府，应不允许它成立；朝鲜应该在具有真正代表性的联合国的保证之下获得统一，并有权决定它自己的政府形式。应该容许它自行决定自己的命运。
    声明继称：我们对于美国政府及军事领袖对台湾采取片面的行动，深表遗憾。台湾历来就是中国的领土，而且世界各国政府也是这样承认了的。我们反对发起这种危害和平的行动。
    声明敦促联合国恢复关于使用及管制原子能的谈判和进行关于普遍裁军的讨论，并指出：战争经济已使美国纳税者所缴付的税额日渐增加，生活费用已经上升到新的高峰，同时，在全世界所有依靠美汇的国家中，也发生了同样的变化。声明斥责国会通过了反动的伍德麦卡伦法案称：这法案威胁到为和平而说话、行动或教育的权利。通过这一法案势将使我们的国家变成一个庞大的集中营，限制我们的思想，并使我们的国家孤立起来，不能与世界其他国家进行自由的联络。
    声明并指出：在美国，为一千四百万黑人争取平等与公民权及反对人头税法案的斗争，是与争取和平的斗争分不开的。
    声明在结语中表示：和平政策委员会愿与全世界危机地区的进步分子站在一起进行斗争。
    和平委员会的组成分子中包括著名的教育家、作家、宗教及社会领袖。他们已于今年五月三十日及三十一日在芝加哥举行的世纪中叶和平大会上成立了永久的和平组织。参加大会的有七百多位代表。
