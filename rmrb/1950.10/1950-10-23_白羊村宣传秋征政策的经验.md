　　Experiences in Promoting the Autumn Grain Collection Policy in Baiyang Village
    Liu Xingmin, Xu Rutan
    I. The Masses' Ideological Concerns
    Baiyang Village is located in the Eighth District of Yichang County, Hubei Province. The entire village has 321 households (including 12 landlord households, 17 rich peasant households, 59 middle peasant households, and 233 poor peasant households), totaling 1,239 people. According to incomplete statistics, the entire village has 1,175 mu of land (including 979 mu of paddy fields and 160 mu of dry land), averaging 0.9 mu of land per person. Last year, the village's agricultural income was 348,500 jin (Editor's note: The original manuscript did not specify whether the agricultural income included the income from cash crops, etc.), and the autumn grain collection was 137,800 jin, accounting for more than 25% of the total agricultural income. The feudal and local bully forces in the village were not overthrown, and the masses were not mobilized. The grain collection began only after a few people assessed the burden. Therefore, the phenomenon of excessively heavy or light assignments was very serious last year. Although it was reduced by 21,609 jin later, there is still a debt of over 900 jin.
    The masses were initially skeptical about this year's collection methods. Some people resisted the autumn grain collection by concealing land and forming a unified line of defense for concealing land. Most of the concealed land was dry land. It is understood that generally one-fifth to one-quarter of paddy fields are concealed, and one-third to one-half of dry land is concealed. Village Chief Zhou Baochen (who used to be a puppet Bao chief) and Cultural and Educational Committee Member Zhang Heting (who used to be a puppet finance officer) took the lead in concealing land. Yang Wenming, chairman of the farmers' association, disagreed with concealing land. When cadres came to the village this autumn to mobilize the masses to conduct a general survey of yields and land acreage, the chairman of the farmers' association said, "This time, we must report thoroughly." The village chief said, "We can't do it thoroughly. If we do it thoroughly, everything will be calculated by doubling it." The village chief also secretly told the masses, "The government can't be fed enough. Even if you report truthfully, they won't believe it." He organized the masses to collectively conceal land. Therefore, the chairman of the farmers' association and the village chief were not united. On September 23, led by the village chief and the cultural and educational committee member, a farmers' association meeting of more than 200 people was convened. Ostensibly, it was to review work, but in reality, it was an attempt to use this to dismiss the chairman of the farmers' association and smoothly achieve the goal of concealing land. Some of the masses also had a kind of mentality of mutual protection, "You don't talk about me, I don't talk about you," and "do not infringe upon each other." In general, there were three concerns: first, fear of offending people; second, fear of having to bear more if the report was truthful; and third, not knowing what this year's methods were and not being able to figure out the bottom line.
    II. Organizing Learning to Enhance the Masses' Understanding
    After the county's autumn grain collection working group came to the village to understand the situation, it first held a cadre meeting to resolve the contradictions between the village chief and the chairman of the farmers' association and explained that they were there to help publicize the policies. Then, a village meeting of more than 200 people was held to explain the basic spirit of this year's autumn grain collection and the benefits of the central government's unified tax law, and the slogan "If you want to handle it fairly, you must learn the policies well" was put forward, which inspired the cadres and the masses to learn. Autumn grain collection slogans, clappers, and tax rate tables were also posted. Then, according to the actual demands of the cadres and the masses, it was proposed to organize study sessions.
    The purpose of the study sessions was to implement the collection policies among the masses so that every household would know them. The study sessions lasted for three days. The first two days were for collective study by cadres during the day, and mass meetings were held in each small village in the evening. The last day was a collective summary study for the entire village. The cadres and masses participated in the study sessions enthusiastically and were in high spirits. On the first day, 48 cadres, committee members, and representatives participated in the study. On the second day, it increased to 76 people (production team leaders and evaluation committee candidates were added). On the first day, 141 people participated in the study. On the second day, it increased to 161 people. At the summary meeting on the third day, a total of 264 people from each small village attended.
    After the study, the cadres and the masses made progress in their understanding. They realized that the reason why there were excessively light or heavy phenomena in last year's autumn grain collection was mainly because they did not understand the policies. Someone said, "If we had done it this way last year, it would have been better, but no one could find the policies. The evaluation committee members didn't let the common people know about the evaluation. Now that everyone has found a way, what are we afraid of?" The study initially yielded the following gains: (1) Recognized the difference between this year's new tax law and last year's method, and were particularly satisfied with the rewards for production labor and the care for military, industrial, and martyr family members. A female representative said during the study, "Chairman Mao is so considerate. He has thought of everything." Others said, "This year's burden is divided into forty grades. This method is fair." In short, they all expressed their strong support for this new tax law. (2) Through the three comparisons (comparing the use, comparing fairness, and comparing lightness and heaviness), the masses realized that "our grain comes from ourselves and is used on ourselves." When the masses realized the spirit of rewarding production in the burden policy, their production enthusiasm increased. For example, evaluation committee member Tan Keli said, "It's still good to be able to work. Those who produce more are not calculated more, and those who produce less also have to bear the burden. This can cure lazy people. This method is reasonable." (3) The masses had a preliminary understanding of opposing land concealment and knew that "one person concealing land will make everyone suffer" and "if the output is not accurate, it will be difficult to be fair." The land concealment defense line began to waver. On the second night of the study, among the 18 people who attended the meeting in a small village, 12 people reflected that they should not have concealed land and voluntarily reported 8 dou of black land. After the meeting, a few people in a small village were discussing "Is it better to conceal or not to conceal?" A number of activists against land concealment emerged in the study, daring to lean towards the government and reflect the situation.
    III. Several Experiences in Implementing Policies
    In explaining and implementing the policies, we have experienced several points:
    (1) To implement the policies, we must be bold and hand over the policies to the masses for discussion without any hesitation. If you are timid and afraid to speak, the masses will have even greater concerns. (2) We must not be satisfied with the performance in meetings and learning enthusiasm, but must go deep into the masses, understand the masses' ideological concerns, and strengthen publicity in response to ideological concerns. (3) In meetings, we must closely integrate the explanation of policies with the actual situation so that it is not boring. It is best to use the three comparisons of the past, present, and uses, and use some specific facts of concealing land and harming people for education. In this way, the masses are most easily accepted and understood. (4) Understand the different reactions of each class, hold meetings of each class separately, and clarify the objects of reliance, unity, winning over, and isolation. When necessary, hold meetings of landlords or talk to individual saboteurs to strive for education in order to reduce the resistance of the work and smoothly turn to the stage of yield assessment. (5) When leading village cadres to study, we should strive for simplicity and clarity. It is best for local cadres to explain the tax law regulations (only explain the relevant articles), explain a paragraph and discuss a paragraph, and use actual examples from the village to illustrate. When calculating, calculate a few households to implement the education of the new tax law from practice.

　　白羊村宣传秋征政策的经验
    刘兴民·徐汝潭
    一、群众的思想顾虑
    白羊村在湖北省宜昌县第八区。全村有三二一户（其中地主一二户，富农一七户，中农五九户，贫农二三三户），一、二三九人。据不完全统计，全村有地一、一七五亩（其中水田九七九亩，旱田一六○亩），每人平均有地零点九亩。去年该村农业收入三四八、五○○斤（编者按：来稿未说明农业收入中，是否包括经济作物等的收入在内。），秋征粮一三七、八○○斤，占农业总收入的百分之二十五以上。该村的封建恶霸势力未打倒，群众未发动起来，只是由几个人评议负担后就开始征粮。因此，去年派粮的畸重畸轻现象很严重。后来虽减了二一、六○九斤，但至今还欠九○○余斤。
    群众对今年的征收办法，最初是怀疑的。有些人以瞒田来抵抗秋征，并组成瞒田统一防线。瞒田多半瞒旱田。据了解，水田一般瞒到五分之一至四分之一，旱田一般瞒到三分之一至一半。村长周保臣（干过伪保长）文教委员张合亭（干过伪财干）等带头瞒田，农会主席杨文明不同意瞒田。今秋干部来村发动群众普查产量地亩时，农会主席说：“这回要报彻底。”村长说：“不能搞彻底，要彻底就一律加一倍计算。”村长并暗地对群众说：“政府是喂不饱的，报实了他们也不相信。”他组织群众集体瞒田。因此，农会主席与村长是不团结的。九月二十三日，以村长、文教委员为首，召集了二百余人的农会大会。名义上是检讨工作，实际上是想借此罢免农会主席，顺利达到瞒田目的。若干群众也是有一种互相包庇的情绪，你不说我，我不说你，互不侵犯。一般都存在着三个顾虑：一、怕得罪人；二、怕报真实了要多负担；三、不知道今年是啥办法，摸不着底。
    二、组织学习，提高群众认识
    县秋征工作组到村了解情况后，首先召开干部会议，解决村长与农会主席的矛盾，并说明是来帮助宣传政策。接着就召开二百多人的村民大会，解释今年秋征的基本精神和中央统一税法的好处，并提出了“要想办公平，就得学好政策”的口号，启发了干部和群众学习的情绪。并张贴了秋征标语、快板、及税率表。接着，根据干部群众的实际要求，提出开办学习会。
    学习会的目的，是把征收政策贯彻到群众中，使得家喻户晓。学习会的时间为三天。头两天的白天为干部集体学习，晚上召集各小村群众学习。最后一天为全村集体总结学习。参加学习的干部、群众很踊跃，情绪也高。第一天参加学习的干部、委员、代表四八人。第二天增加到七六人（增加了生产组长、评委候选人）。第一天参加学习的群众一四一人。第二天增加到一六一人。第三天总结大会时，各小村共到二六四人。
    经过学习后，干部、群众在认识上都提高了一步。他们认识了去年秋征所以有畸轻畸重现象，主要是不懂政策。有人说：“去年要这么办的话，也好些，就是都找不到政策。评议委员评议又不叫老百姓知道。现在大家都找到办法了，还怕办不公？”学习中初步获得了下面几点收获：（一）认识了今年新税法和去年办法的不同，特别对奖励生产劳动及照顾军、工、烈属感到满意。一个妇女代表在学习时说：“毛主席照顾的真周到，处处他都想到了。”还有的说：“今年负担分四十级，这个办法可公平啦。”总之，对这一新税法都表示非常拥护。（二）从三比（比用途、比公平、比轻重）中，群众认识了“我们的粮出在自己身上，又用在自己身上。”群众体会到负担政策中的奖励生产的精神时，生产情绪提高了一步。如评议委员谭克里说：“还是能劳动的好，多生产的不多算，少生产的也得出负担，这样能治懒汉子，这个办法就合理。”（三）群众对反瞒田有了初步的认识，知道了“一人瞒田，大家吃亏”“产量弄不实负担就难公平”。瞒田防线开始动摇了。在学习的第二天晚上，一小村到会的十八个人中，就有十二个人反省不该瞒田，自动报出黑田八斗种。一小村群众在散会后，剩下几个人在商讨“究竟是瞒好还是不瞒好？”在学习中涌现了一批反瞒田的积极分子，敢于与政府靠拢，反映情况。
    三、贯彻政策中的几点经验
    在解释和贯彻政策中，体验到几点经验：
    （一）贯彻政策必须大胆放手，毫不顾虑地把政策交给群众自己讨论。小手小脚不敢讲，群众顾虑更大。（二）不能单纯满足于会议上及学习情绪上的表现，必须深入到群众中去，了解群众思想顾虑，针对思想顾虑加强宣传。（三）在会议上，必须把讲政策与实际情况紧密结合起来，才不枯燥。最好是用比过去比现在比用途的三比教育，及用某些瞒田害人的具体事实进行教育。这样群众最易接受与领会。（四）了解各阶层不同反映，分头召开各阶层的会议，明确依靠、团结、争取、孤立的对象。必要时召开地主会议，或与个别破坏分子谈话，争取教育，以减少工作的阻力，顺利转入评产阶段。（五）领导村干学习时，应力求通俗，最好由当地干部讲解税法条例（只讲有关的几条），讲一段讨论一段，并拿出本村实际例子来说明。在计算时拿出几户算一算，这样从实际中贯彻新税法的教育。
