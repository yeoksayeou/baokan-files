Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th: A Pravda observer wrote a commentary on the 27th regarding the reaction of bourgeois newspapers to the declaration of the meeting of the foreign ministers of the eight countries, stating that: The working people of all countries believe that this declaration is a truly democratic program for the peaceful resolution of the German question, and it also reflects the hopes of all peace advocates who desire international peace and democratic cooperation.

The commentary pointed out: In order to dilute the impact of the declaration of the eight foreign ministers on the world, newspapers in capitalist countries are deliberately attempting to distort this declaration. As usual, they say that this declaration is a "propaganda offensive" and intends to "spread discord around the world," while setting aside the suggestions in the declaration. The remarks of the New York Herald Tribune have revealed that the American ruling group disagrees with the demands of the declaration of the eight foreign ministers and openly expresses its disagreement with the possible prospect of avoiding the rearmament of West Germany.

The commentary continued: However, the declaration of the eight foreign ministers has clearly caused unease and confusion among the U.S. and British ruling classes. A diplomatic observer of the New York Times unambiguously stated that this declaration is a stumbling block to the meeting of the defense ministers of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty signatories. The defense ministers' meeting is to discuss the issue of West Germany's participation in the so-called "defense" organization of Western Europe. An editorial in the London Times also pointed out: It is best to discuss the German issue with the Soviet Union, rather than approving a "separate conference on the German issue." Some British newspapers, especially the conservative Yorkshire Post, clearly understand that the current Western policy aimed at splitting Germany is of no benefit to Britain, and thus reached a sober conclusion: "The division of Germany cannot exist indefinitely." Even among the reactionary newspapers of the Italian ruling camp, there are voices supporting careful consideration of the Prague resolution.

The commentary emphasized: The remarks of newspapers in capitalist countries have clearly shown that the specific and clear suggestions in the declaration of the eight foreign ministers have embarrassed the U.S. and British imperialists and fully exposed the huge aggressive plans they are secretly preparing.

　　八国外长声明获得各国人民支持
    美英统治阶级陷于窘境
    反动舆论处心积虑企图曲解
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报观察家于二十七日撰文评论资产阶级报纸对苏联等八国外长会议声明的反应称：各国劳动人民都认为这个声明是和平解决德国问题的真正民主纲领，这一声明也反映了一切渴望国际间的和平与民主合作的和平拥护者的希望。
    评论指出：资本主义国家的报纸为了冲淡八国外长声明在全世界造成的影响，正处心积虑地曲解这个声明。它们照例说这一声明是“宣传攻势”和打算“在全世界散布不和”，而把声明中的建议撇在一边。纽约先驱论坛报的言论已透露了美国统治集团不同意八国外长声明的要求，并且公开表示不同意有避免西德重新武装的可能前途。
    评论继称：但是，八国外长声明已显然在美、英统治阶层中引起了不安与混乱。纽约时报外交观察家毫不含糊地表示：这个声明是侵略性的北大西洋公约签字各国国防部长会议的绊脚石。国防部长会议是要讨论西德参加所谓西欧“防御”组织的问题的。伦敦泰晤士报社论亦指出：最好能同苏联商讨德国问题，而不赞成“关于德国问题的单独的会议”。有些英国报纸特别是保守党的约克郡邮报显然了解到，西方国家旨在分裂德国的现行政策对英国是没有什么好处的，因而得出了清醒的结论：“德国的分裂不能无止境地长此存在下去”。就是意大利统治阵营的反动的报纸中，也有支持慎重考虑布拉格决议的呼声。
    评论着重指出：资本主义国家报纸的言论已清晰地表明了八国外长会议声明的具体而明确的建议，已使美英帝国主义者们困窘不堪，并且充分地暴露了它们正在诡秘地准备着的庞大的侵略计划。
