　　Chahar Province Begins Autumn Plowing
    Northern Chahar's 40,000 Oxen Have Already Plowed Three Million Mu
    Southern Chahar's Autumn Plowing Left to Its Own Devices, Leadership Issues Instructions to Correct
    [Zhangjiakou Dispatch] Chahar Daily News: Farmers in various parts of Northern Chahar are combining the autumn harvest, threshing, and transporting crops to intensify autumn plowing. According to reports from various counties, approximately 40,000 oxen are being used in joint plowing, having already plowed over three million mu of land, reaching about 50% of the sown area. Zhangbei County alone has 10,000 teams of oxen engaged in autumn plowing. In Yanjia Village and two other villages in the county, over 20 hectares of farmland have been completely plowed. In some villages, all green land has also been re-plowed. The county is expected to basically complete autumn plowing work by the Frost's Descent solar term (October 24th). In Chongli County, where autumn plowing started later, it is reported that 1,149 oxen teams from the 2nd and 6th districts and Qian Gou sub-district have been mobilized to participate in autumn plowing. The 6th district has already plowed 23,000 mu, reaching 30% of the sown land. The masses in the county are striving to complete over 85% of autumn plowing, and some plan to plow 100% of the land in the autumn.

    The main characteristics of autumn plowing in various places are the joint efforts of people and animals and plowing immediately after harvesting. Most of the 33 oxen teams participating in plowing in Miaodongying Village, Zhangbei County, are joint animal power teams. Many places also use human labor in exchange for animal power, and straw in exchange for oxen labor, which has greatly helped to overcome the difficulties of insufficient labor and animal power. In the early stage of autumn plowing in Datongying Village, Chongli County, the accounts of labor exchange from the spring and summer seasons were cleared up, effectively dispelling the masses' concerns about suffering losses from joint plowing. Of the 53 livestock in the village, 30 have been combined into 15 teams. By September 16th, 821 mu of the 935 mu of autumn land that had been harvested had been plowed. Li Mingxing, a farmer in the 1st district of Shangyi County, said, "Plowing immediately after harvesting is better than pressing green; plowing more land this year means harvesting more grain next year."

    Currently, the main problem in autumn plowing in the Northern Chahar area is that households without animal power (the poor, opium addicts, immigrants, orphans, etc.) and villages and households whose animal power was severely damaged by the war still face considerable difficulties in completing autumn plowing. To solve this problem, it is necessary to actively organize the purchase of oxen for plowing. However, the first step should be to eliminate the concerns of livestock owners, implement voluntary buying and selling of oxen, fairly negotiate wages, ensure that livestock owners do not suffer losses, and stimulate exchanges between farmers.

    [This Newspaper Dispatch] Cadres and the masses in various counties in Southern Chahar do not pay enough attention to autumn plowing work, resulting in an abnormally slow pace of autumn plowing in various counties. As of September 25th, Longguan County, which has done relatively well in autumn plowing, has plowed 140,000 mu of land, accounting for 28% of the area that should be plowed. Huai'an has plowed 100,000 mu, accounting for 20% of the area that should be plowed. Other counties are even worse. For example, Huailai has only plowed about 10,000 mu, which is less than 2% of the 650,000 mu that should be plowed. In Yangyuan, half of the 830,000 mu of land has been harvested, but autumn plowing work has not yet started. It is estimated that no more than 10% of the entire area has been plowed. The main reasons for the above situation are: First, leaders at all levels are busy with rectification and demobilization work, neglecting the leadership of the "Three Autumns" work, only paying lip service without taking action, causing autumn plowing work to drift. Second, after the rectification campaign, some cadres are afraid of making mistakes by issuing compulsory orders and are hesitant in their work, daring not boldly lead the masses; some cadres even adopt a passive and resistant attitude. For example, a civil affairs assistant in the 3rd district of Yangyuan said: "Last year, we forced the masses to do autumn plowing. This year, we will mobilize them. Let them plow if they want to!" Third, some district cadres believe that, having had the experience of autumn plowing last year, the masses have already realized the benefits of autumn plowing, leading to a blind and optimistic idea that "there will be no problem," and thus they have relaxed their leadership. Fourth, many village cadres and the masses harbor resistance to autumn plowing, saying things like: "Last year's forced autumn plowing was wrong. This year, they (referring to the district cadres) won't dare to force us again. This year, we'll do as we please..." "We won't be livestock again this year (referring to humans pulling plows)." "We'll see how much we plow! We'll plow as much as we can." Therefore, they are not actively engaged in autumn plowing.

    All of the above are the biggest obstacles to this year's autumn plowing. If they are not corrected as soon as possible, it will be difficult to complete this year's autumn plowing task, which will have a great impact on agricultural production next year. In view of this, the Southern Chahar District Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Commissioner's Office, in order to successfully complete autumn plowing, in addition to transferring 97 cadres to the countryside to assist various counties in strengthening autumn plowing leadership, also instructed various counties that, in addition to deeply reviewing the previous stage of autumn plowing leadership, they should immediately organize forces, go deep into the countryside, lead by regions, take responsibility at each level, and promptly supervise and inspect to ensure the completion of 90% of the area that should be plowed, and strive to reach 100%. They should also pay attention to checking the quality of plowing and prevent the tendency of fake plowing. The instructions also pointed out that in leading autumn plowing work, all human and animal power should be mobilized to invest in the autumn plowing movement, women should be mobilized to take on tasks such as autumn harvesting and threshing, and male labor should be freed up to pull plows and dig land. In areas lacking animal power, oxen should be appropriately adjusted in a planned and step-by-step manner under the principles of voluntariness and employment. The instructions called on all cadres, Party members, and Youth League members to stand at the forefront of the autumn plowing movement, truly lead production with production, and drive the masses with their own exemplary actions, and strive to successfully complete autumn plowing.

### 察省各地开始秋耕  察北四万犋牛已耕地三百万亩  察南秋耕自流领导上指示纠正

　　察省各地开始秋耕
    察北四万犋牛已耕地三百万亩
    察南秋耕自流领导上指示纠正
    【张家口讯】察哈尔日报消息：察北各地农民正结合秋收、打尝拉庄稼，加紧进行秋耕。据各县报告：全区约有四万犋牛合犋上套，已耕地三百余万亩，达播种面积的百分之五十左右。仅张北一县即有万套牛犋秋耕。该县阎家村等三个村庄，二十多顷耕地已全部耕过；个别村庄青地亦已全部复耕，全县至霜降节（十月二十四日）可基本结束秋耕工作。秋耕开始较晚的崇礼县，据报该县二、六两区及前沟小区已出动一千一百四十九犋牛参加秋耕。六区已耕过两万三千亩，达播种土地百分之三十。该县群众要争取完成秋耕百分之八十五以上，部分群众计划把地百分之百的秋耕过。
    各地秋耕中的主要特点是人畜拨工合犋，随收随耕。张北庙东营村参加耕地的三十三犋牛犋中绝大部分是畜力合犋的。各地以人力换畜力、秸草换牛工的也很多，这对克服劳畜力不足的困难起了很大作用。崇礼大同营村秋耕初期即清理了春、夏两季的拨工账，以实际行动解除了群众怕合犋吃亏的顾虑，全村五十三头牲口，已有三十头合起了十五犋。至九月十六日止，就把割完的九百三十五亩秋地耕过八百二十一亩。尚义县一区农民李明星说：“收了就耕，赛过压青；今年多耕地，明年打粮多。”
    目前察北地区秋耕中的主要问题是无畜力户（贫民、烟民、移民、孤寡等）及曾因战争伤损畜力过重的村、户完成秋耕尚有不少困难。解决这个问题应积极组织买犋耕地。但首先应从消除畜主顾虑，贯彻自愿买卖牛犋，公平商订工资，保证畜主不吃亏，活跃农民间的来往着手。
    【本报讯】察南各县干部群众对秋耕工作重视不足，致使各县的秋耕工作进行异常缓慢。截至九月二十五日止，秋耕较好的龙关县已耕地十四万亩，占应耕地面积百分之二十八；怀安耕过十万亩，占应耕地面积百分之二十；其他各县则更差，如怀来仅耕万亩左右，还不到应耕地面积六十五万亩的百分之二。阳原八十三万亩地已经收割半数，而秋耕工作还没有开始。估计全区已耕地不过百分之十。造成以上情况的主要原因是：一、各级领导忙于整风及复员工作，忽视对三秋工作的领导，仅限于口头空喊，没有行动起来，使秋耕工作陷于自流。二、整风以后，有些干部害怕犯强迫命令的错误，工作缩手缩脚，不敢大胆领导群众；甚至有些干部采取消极抵抗态度。如阳原三区民政助理员说：“去年强迫群众秋耕，今年动员他，愿耕就耕吧！”三、某些区干部认为有了去年秋耕的经验，群众已体会到秋耕好处，产生了“不成问题”的盲目乐观思想，也就放松了领导。四、不少村干部和群众对秋耕存有抵抗情绪，说什么：“去年秋耕强迫错了，今年他们（指区干部）再不敢强迫了，今年由着咱们了……。”“今年再不当牲口了（指人拉犁）。”“看着耕吧！耕多少算多少。”因此不积极进行秋耕。
    以上这些都是今年秋耕中最大的阻力，如不及早纠正，则今年的秋耕任务势难完成，对明年的农业生产将会有很大的影响。中共察南地委和专署有鉴于此，为胜利完成秋耕，除抽调九十七名干部下乡协助各县加强秋耕领导外，并指示各县，除深刻检讨前一段的秋耕领导外，应立即组织力量，深入农村，分片领导，逐级负责，及时督促检查，保证完成应耕面积百分之九十，争取达到百分之百，并注意检查耕地质量，防止假耕偏向。指示并指出在领导秋耕工作中，应动员所有人畜力投入秋耕运动，发动妇女担负起秋收打场等任务，腾出男劳力拉犁挖地；畜力缺乏地区，在自愿与雇用的原则下，有计划有步骤地适当调剂牛犋。指示号召所有干部、党、团员要站在秋耕运动的最前面，切实作到以生产领导生产，以自己的模范行动带动群众，为胜利完成秋耕而奋斗。
