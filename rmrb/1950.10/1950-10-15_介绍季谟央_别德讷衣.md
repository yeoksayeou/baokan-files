Introducing Demyan Bedny
	Y. Chalov

	Demyan Bedny (1883-1945) was an outstanding writer of satirical poems and fables, and one of the founders of Soviet poetry. His poems first appeared in the Bolshevik newspapers *Zvezda* and *Pravda* in 1912. From then on, he gained a certain position in literature. He was not a "believer in pure art"; he served the people with his outstanding talent. Bedny's poetry not only expressed the sorrow and pain of the trampled Russian peasants and workers, but also shouted out their anger and social protest, calling for a revolutionary struggle against the Russian bourgeoisie and landlord system, and making a severe and just accusation against this system.

	Demyan Bedny began writing during the years when the reactionary Tsarist censorship was rampant. He was often forced not to speak clearly, so he adopted figurative forms to conceal his thoughts. This is how he began writing fables.

	The poet's works attracted the attention of Lenin and Stalin.

	Bedny used his fables, essay-like poems, and short poems to attack the enemies of the working class. After the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, his satirical poems became excellent weapons in the struggle against the internal and external enemies of the young Soviet state. During the civil war, he used his pen to fight against the White Army and foreign invaders, winning the praise of the Red Army. During the period of peaceful national construction, he continued to attack the activities of those conspirators who endangered the motherland.

	Bedny foresaw the malicious plans of those greedy imperialists; relentlessly exposed their plots, and lashed out at those who provoked war against the Soviet Union.

	The ideological and artistic achievements of the poet's political satire have stood the test of time. A collection of his poems on international issues, written twenty years ago, has been published in Moscow this year. Although the subject matter is from two generations ago, these poems still retain their vitality today. His pungent verses expose the enemies of the people, and still have a moving power today.

	Bedny's book, entitled "Familiar Faces" – these faces are still familiar to today's readers. Here, we can find figures like Churchill, Bevin, Chiang Kai-shek, the servants of Wall Street, the French right-wing socialist puppets, and Vatican reactionary special agents like the American lackey, Cardinal Spellman.

	He exposed what so-called "happy" American life is like: unemployment, poverty, and political oppression are vividly depicted.

	Bedny exposed how American imperialists pursue profits and expand their territory, and support reactionary forces around the world. He pointed out that there is a "happy" country, where taxpayers bear heavy taxes to support the finances of the evil Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The poet wrote:

	For the unemployed -
		No funds, no cash;
	But for murderers, bandits,
		And all kinds of political waste,
	There is always a large amount of money in reserve.

	The Chinese people have shattered the iron net that Bedny spoke of. The "Pacific storm" he predicted has brought about the great victory of the Chinese revolution. The poet said: "You beasts in human clothing! You miscalculated!" His words have been realized.

	I want to watch the rogue's career
		Until his final demise! He wrote this about Chiang Kai-shek. Now, we have seen the shameful end of Chiang Kai-shek, who once aroused Bedny's angry criticism.

	Bedny saw through the prospect of hypocritical bourgeois freedom, because he saw in 1929 how Voltaire's books were banned in the United States:

	Voltaire's pungent ridicule
		Deeply stung the fools of the old era.
	Today - how strange it is! -
		The country of millionaires
	Is stepping step by step towards the age of cavemen.

	Today, as the forces of peace and true democracy are growing unprecedentedly, Demyan Bedny's poetry has become a weapon in the sacred struggle against the enemies of mankind, the war-mongers.

	Bedny combined his keen political observation with the high standards of poetic art. He abandoned those stale dogmas and included in his poems many subjects that were previously considered unsuitable for poetry.

	A significant part of Bedny's works describes the new life of the Soviet state. His poems express not only the lofty aspirations of the Soviet people, but also of working people all over the world. In his poems, pamphlets, and short satirical works, he praises the unity of ordinary people and the close friendship between nations. He hurls harsh sarcasm at enemies and expresses warm love to friends. He firmly believes that more and more people will join the "group of friendship" of freedom and peace.

	His dream has come true today. Demyan Bedny's poems will forever occupy its place, as long as readers there understand that the realm of poetry is not only "beauty", but also includes the struggle for "beauty". The modern concept of "beauty" is the same as the concepts of peace, freedom, and justice. (Translated by Jiuquan from the September issue of *Soviet Literature*)

　　介绍季谟央·别德讷衣
    亚·查洛夫
    季谟央·别德讷衣（１８８３—１９４５）是杰出的讽刺诗和寓言的作家，他是苏维埃诗歌的奠基人之一。他的诗作最初出现在一九一二年的布尔什维克的报纸《星报》和《真理报》上。从那时起，他就在文学方面获得一定的地位。他不是什么“纯艺术的信徒”；他以他的卓越的才能服务于人民。别德讷衣的诗歌不但表现了被践踏的俄罗斯农民和工人的悲伤和痛苦；而且喊出了他们的愤怒和对社会的抗议，那是反对俄罗斯资产阶级——地主制度的革命斗争的号召，是对这个制度的严厉而正义的控诉。
    季谟央·别德讷衣开始写作是在反动沙皇的检查制度猖獗的年代。他常常被迫不能说得明显，于是采用了比喻的形式来掩护他的思想。这样他就开始写寓言。
    诗人的作品引起了列宁和斯大林的注意。
    别德讷衣用他的寓言、杂文式的诗和短诗，打击工人阶级的敌人。在十月社会主义革命胜利之后，他的讽刺诗成为向年轻的苏维埃国家的内外敌人作斗争的优秀的武器。在内战中，他用他的笔向白军和外国侵略者作战，赢得了红军们的赞美。在国家进入和平建设的时期，他继续打击那些危害祖国的阴谋分子的活动。
    别德讷衣预见了那些贪婪的帝国主义者的恶毒计划；无情地揭穿他们的图谋，鞭挞那些挑拨对苏作战的人们。
    诗人的政治讽刺作品的思想与艺术上的成就，业已经历了时代的考验。他的一册有关国际问题的二十年前写的诗选，本年已在莫斯科出版。虽则题材是两个世代以前的，这些诗直到今天还保留它们的生命力。他的辛辣的诗句，把人民的敌人揭露出来，直到现在还没有失掉动人的力量。
    别德讷衣的书，名为《熟面孔》——这些脸面对于一个今天的读者依旧是熟悉的。在这里，我们可以找到像邱吉尔、贝文、蒋介石、华尔街的仆从、法国右翼社会党傀儡、以及美国走狗明曾蒂红衣主教那样的梵蒂冈反动特务之类的人物。
    他拆穿了所谓“幸福”的美国生活是怎样的：失业、贫困和政治压迫被生动地描写着。
    别德讷衣暴露了美国帝国主义者怎样追求利润和扩张领土，以及支持世界各地的反动力量。他指出有一个“幸福”的国家，那儿纳税人担负着重赋，去支持罪恶的蒋介石匪帮的财政。诗人写道：
    对于失业者——
    没有经费，没有现款；
    但是对于杀人犯，匪徒，
    和各式各样政治废物，
    却总是储备着大量的金钱。
    中国人民击溃了别德讷衣所说的铁的罗网。他所预言的“太平洋的风暴”已带来了中国革命的伟大胜利。诗人说：“衣冠禽兽们！你们算错了！”他的话是实现了。
    我愿意注视着流氓的事业
    直到他最后的完蛋！他这样写蒋介石。现在，我们已经看到曾经引起别德讷衣愤怒抨击的蒋介石的可耻结局。
    别德讷衣看到了虚伪的资产阶级自由的前途，因为他在一九二九年就看到伏尔泰的书怎样在美国遭到查禁：
    伏尔泰的辛辣的嘲笑
    深深地刺痛了旧时代的愚人。
    今天——那是多么可怪的事啊！——
    百万富翁的国家
    一步一步地走向穴居人的时代。
    今天，当和平与真正民主的力量获得空前成长时，季谟央·别德讷衣的诗歌已成为对人类的敌人，战争叫嚣者，进行神圣斗争的一件武器。
    别德讷衣把他的敏锐的政治观察力，与高度的诗歌艺术的标准，结合起来。他抛弃了那些陈腐的教条，在他的诗中包括许多过去认为不能入诗的题材。
    别德讷衣的著作中有一显著的部分描写苏维埃国家的新生活。他的诗不仅表现了苏联人民的，而且是全世界劳动者的崇高愿望。在他的诗歌中，小册子中，短的讽刺作品中，他歌颂普通人民的团结一致，和国际间的亲密友谊。他对敌人发出苛刻的讥讽，他对朋友吐露热烈的爱心。他深信将有更多更多的人加入到自由和平的“友谊的集团”中来。
    他的梦，今天实现了。季谟央·别德讷衣的诗永远将占有它的地位，只要那儿的读者了解诗歌的领域不仅仅是“美”，而且也包括为了“美”而作的斗争。“美”的现代的概念是与和平、自由、正义的概念相同的。（酒泉节译自《苏维埃文学》本年九月号）
