Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The Central People's Government Ministry of Education took over the private Fu Jen Catholic University on the 12th. Over 3,000 faculty, students, and staff members of the university held a celebration rally this morning. The school gate and auditorium were decorated with lanterns and colored streamers, and large banners were hung that read: "Support the People's Government's Takeover," "Celebrate the Rebirth of Fu Jen University," and "Faculty, Staff, and Workers Unite to Run New Fu Jen Well."

At the celebration rally, President Chen Yuan delivered the opening speech. He said, "Our faculty, students, and staff have been opposing the interference of imperialist elements for more than two months. During these two months, the Church has stopped funding. If it were not for the support of the People's Government, all 3,000 of our faculty, students, and staff would certainly lose their schooling and jobs." He also said, "The Church's cessation of Fu Jen's funding has been tolerated by the government for more than two months, and has finally reached the point of intolerability. In order to ensure the studies and work of Fu Jen's faculty, students, and staff, and to recover the nation's educational sovereignty, the government has decided to take over Fu Jen and run it independently. This is absolutely welcomed and supported by all our faculty, students, and staff. From today on, Fu Jen has gained true liberation."

Following him, Ma Xulun, Minister of the Central People's Government Ministry of Education, spoke. He pointed out: According to international practice, foreigners or their organizations are not allowed to establish schools within China, but because they have been running for many years, they are temporarily allowed to continue. Unfortunately, Fu Jen Catholic University recently experienced a case of foreigners interfering in our country's educational administrative sovereignty, which almost made it impossible for Fu Jen Catholic University to continue. In order to avoid losses to the interests of the people, the government has decided to maintain this school and to develop it, and run it well. Minister Ma immediately read out the order of the Central People's Government Ministry of Education regarding the takeover of Fu Jen Catholic University and announced the appointment of Chen Yuan as President of Fu Jen Catholic University. During the school's takeover period, a takeover team will be established, headed by Zhang Zonglin, Deputy Director of the Higher Education Department of the Central People's Government Ministry of Education, with President Chen Yuan as the deputy leader. Minister Ma concluded by saying, "I not only hope but also believe that under the leadership of the Central People's Government Ministry of Education, under the leadership of President Chen Yuan, and with the efforts of all of you comrades, the future of Fu Jen Catholic University is bright and splendid." Minister Ma's speech elicited enthusiastic and prolonged applause from all the faculty, students, and staff.

Qian Junrui and Wei Que, Vice Ministers of the Central People's Government Ministry of Education, also spoke successively. They pointed out that the nature of imperialism can be seen in the handling of the Fu Jen Catholic University issue. They used funding as a threat to force us to dismiss progressive professors and replace the president. This is an infringement on our country's educational sovereignty, which the Chinese people will never allow. In their speeches, they emphasized the policy of freedom of education and religious belief in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Following them, Chai Degeng, representative of the Fu Jen Catholic University Labor Union, Xu Bingxin, representative of the students, and Xue Chengye, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education and an alumnus of the university, spoke. They unanimously believed that this is a day of great joy for Fu Jen, a day of liberation for education in a semi-colonial country for more than a hundred years, and expressed their solidarity in running Fu Jen well under the leadership of the Central People's Government Ministry of Education and President Chen. Xu Xide, an old Catholic who has been a believer for 32 years at the school, said in his speech, "The Church's subsidies have been decided to be stopped, and now the People's Government is taking over and running the school independently, guaranteeing the smooth progress of Fu Jen Catholic University's operations. All colleagues at Fu Jen are very grateful and excited. In the future, believers and non-believers, despite their different beliefs, should unite and cooperate under the common goal of building a new democratic society and implementing the new democratic education policy to run Fu Jen Catholic University well."

Zhang Zonglin, the leader of the takeover team, spoke, calling on all faculty, students, and staff to work and study as usual, protect school property, unite the entire school, unite believers and non-believers, and jointly run Fu Jen Catholic University well.

　　中央人民政府教育部
    接办辅仁大学
    辅大三千师生员工集会庆祝拥护政府措施决心办好辅仁
    【新华社十二日讯】中央人民政府教育部于十二日接办私立辅仁大学。该校三千余师、生、员、工今日上午举行庆祝大会。该校校门和大礼堂内张灯结彩，并悬挂巨幅标语：“拥护人民政府接办”，“庆祝辅仁大学新生”，“教职学工团结起来办好新辅仁”。
    庆祝大会上，首由校长陈垣致开会词。他说：“我们师生员工反对帝国主义分子干涉已经有两个多月了。这两个多月里头，教会方面停止了经费，如果不是人民政府的支持，我们全校三千多师生员工一定失学失业。”他又说：“教会停发辅仁经费，政府已经容忍了两个多月，终于到了不能容忍的地步。为了辅仁师、生、员、工的学习和工作，为了收回国家的教育主权，政府决定把辅仁接收自办。这是我们全校师生员工所绝对欢迎和拥护的。从今天起、辅仁得到了真正的解放。”
    继由中央人民政府教育部部长马叙伦讲话。他指出：外国人或他们的团体在中国境内创办学校，照国际惯例是不容许的，但因为已经办了多年，暂时还允许续办。不幸辅仁大学最近发生了外国人干涉我国教育行政主权的事情，几乎使辅仁大学陷于不能维持。政府为了不使人民利益受损失，决定维持这个学校，并要使这个学校得到发展，把它办好。马部长当即宣读中央人民政府教育部关于接办辅仁大学的命令，并宣布任命陈垣为辅仁大学校长；在学校接办期间，成立接办小组，由中央人民政府教育部高教司副司长张宗麟任组长，陈垣校长任副组长。马部长最后说：“我不仅希望而且相信：辅仁大学在中央人民政府教育部领导下，在陈垣校长领导下，在你们全体同志的努力下，前景是光明灿烂的。”马部长的讲话，接连引起全场师、生、员、工热烈经久的掌声。
    中央人民政府教育部副部长钱俊瑞、韦悫也相继致词。他们指出：在辅仁大学问题的处理过程中，可以看出帝国主义者的面目。他们以经费为要挟，要我们辞退进步教授，撤换校长。这是对我国教育主权的侵犯，是中国人民所绝不容许的。他们在讲话中着重阐明了人民政协共同纲领中关于教育政策和宗教信仰自由的政策。
    继由辅仁大学工会代表柴德赓、学生代表徐炳鑫、校友北京市文教局副局长薛成业讲话。他们一致认为这是辅仁大喜的日子，是一百多年来半殖民地的教育翻身解放的日子，并表示团结一致在中央人民政府教育部和陈校长领导下办好辅仁。该校奉教三十二年的老天主教徒徐希德发言时说：“教会方面的补助费已决定停止，现在人民政府接收自办，保障了辅仁大学校务的顺利进行，辅仁全体同仁都很感激兴奋。今后教友和非教友尽管信仰不同，都应在建设新民主主义社会和贯彻新民主主义教育方针的共同目标下团结合作，办好辅仁大学。”
    接办小组组长张宗麟讲话，号召全校师、生、员、工照常工作和学习，保护校产，全校团结，教徒和非教徒团结，共同办好辅仁。
