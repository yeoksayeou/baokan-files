　　Xinhua News Agency, Yangzhou, 23rd -- The first People's Representative Conference of all circles in the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Region, with the central topic of how to complete land reform throughout the region, was held from the 7th to the 15th. The conference spent most of its time discussing the issue of completing land reform in the area this winter and next spring. The conference unanimously agreed that Northern Jiangsu can be divided into three types of areas based on the time of liberation: old areas, restored areas, and new areas. In the old areas, land reform has already been completed in regions with more than 4.4 million agricultural population; in the new areas and some restored areas, land reform has not yet been carried out in regions with about 10 million agricultural population. After the liberation of the entire region last year, preparatory work for land reform was carried out in the new and restored areas. Up to now, bandits in the entire territory have been basically eliminated; 79% of the district and township governments in the new areas have undergone democratic reform, and mass organizations have been gradually improved. The peasant masses are extremely eager for land reform; since August of this year, more than 5,000 land reform work cadres in the entire region have completed their training and have begun typical experiments in land reform, conducting comprehensive rural surveys. Therefore, this winter and next spring, except for individual severely affected areas, the entire region can complete the task of land reform on schedule.

　　苏北首届人民代表会议确定
    今冬明春完成全区土地改革
    【新华社扬州二十三日电】以如何完成全区土地改革为中心议题的苏北行政区首届各界人民代表会议，已于七日至十五日举行。会议以大部分时间讨论了该区于今冬明春结束土地改革的问题。会议一致认为：苏北全区可按解放时间的迟早，分为老区、恢复区和新区三种类型地区。在老区中，已有四百余万农业人口的地区已经完成了土地改革；新区和部分恢复区，约有一千万农业人口的地区，还未进行土地改革。去年全区解放后，即在新区和恢复区进行了土地改革的准备工作。到目前为止，全境土匪已基本肃清；新区已有百分之七十九的区、乡政权进行了民主改革，逐步地健全了群众组织，农民群众对土地改革的要求极为迫切；今年八月以来，全区五千余名土地改革工作干部已训练完毕，并已开始了土地改革的典型实验，进行了全面的农村调查工作。因此，在今冬明春，除个别重灾区外，全区可按期完成土地改革的任务。
