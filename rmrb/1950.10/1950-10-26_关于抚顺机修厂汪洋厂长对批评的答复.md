　　Regarding Director Wang Yang of the Fushun Machine Repair Factory's Response to Criticism

    To the Editor:
    I have some opinions after reading Director Wang Yang of the Fushun Machine Repair Factory's response to Lu Bo's criticism, published in the People's Garden on October 11th. I think that Director Wang Yang's understanding of criticism is insufficient, and therefore his attitude in responding to the criticism is not humble enough. For example, regarding "the accident of solidification in the three-ton iron furnace, the loss reached 1 billion Northeast currency, but calculated at cost, the actual loss was only over 100 million Northeast currency." Under normal circumstances, factory losses should include both cost and profit, but he emphasizes calculation at cost.
    Director Wang Yang acknowledges that "72 mechanical equipment accidents and 168 injury accidents occurred in the first half of the year." However, on the other hand, he says: "Only seven were major, the rest were general accidents!" In fact, whether it is a major injury or a general injury, Director Wang Yang should seriously analyze the subjective and objective reasons in order to improve his work. However, Comrade Wang Yang did not do so.
    Director Wang Yang is a cadre who has undergone a long period of revolutionary training and should treat criticism with a correct attitude and humbly examine himself. Comrade Wang Yang did not do enough in that letter responding to criticism.

### 关于抚顺机修厂汪洋厂长对批评的答复

　　关于抚顺机修厂汪洋厂长对批评的答复
    编辑同志：
    十月十一日人民园地发表了抚顺机修厂汪洋厂长对鲁勃批评的答复，我读后有些意见。我觉得汪洋厂长对批评的认识是不够的，因而在答复批评时态度不够虚心。例如“三吨铁炉凝固的责任事故，损失达十亿元东北币，按成本计算，实际上仅损失一亿余元东北币。”根据一般情况，工厂损耗，应该将成本和利润合起计算，但他却强调按成本计算。
    汪洋厂长一方面承认“上半年发生机械设备事故七十二次，伤害事故一百六十八次。”但另一方面他说：“重大的只有七次，此外都是一般的事故！”其实，重大伤害也好，一般伤害也好，汪洋厂长都应该认真分析其主客观的原因，以便改进工作。但汪洋同志没有这样做。
    汪洋厂长是一个经过长期革命锻炼的干部，应该以正确的态度对待批评，虚心检讨自己。这一点，汪洋同志在那篇答复批评的信里做得很不够。
