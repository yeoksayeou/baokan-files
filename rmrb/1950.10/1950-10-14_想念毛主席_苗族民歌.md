　　Missing Chairman Mao
    ——Miao Folk Song
    In the old days,
    When we were still young,
    Some were only one year old,
    Others were two years old,
    Chairman Mao passed through our area during the Long March,
    And wrote characters at the edge of the village,
    Only when the Miao people awakened,
    Could we have food and clothing.
    Later, when we grew a little older,
    Our mothers told us:
    "You must know,
    A savior of ours passed through here before,
    But we only saw him leave,
    And never saw him come back!"
    We waited and waited,
    Waited for fourteen years,
    The fifteenth year arrived,
    Our father—our savior—came,
    Came to call us to rise up,
    And we gathered together,
    And followed our Chairman Mao.
    We have food and clothing,
    We have become plump and white,
    As clear and refreshing as spring water,
    As round and bright as pearls.

　　想念毛主席
    ——苗族民歌
    在以前的时候，
    我们年纪还小，
    有的只一岁，
    有的是二岁，
    毛主席长征经过我们的地方，
    写下字在寨边，
    在苗家觉醒起来，
    才能有吃有穿。
    后来我们稍长大了，
    妈妈告诉我们：
    “你们要知道，
    以前有一个我们的救星经过这里，
    但是只见他去了，
    不见他再来啦！”
    我们等了又等，
    等了十四年，
    十五年到了，
    我们的父亲——救星来到了，
    来叫我们起来，
    我们就聚集在一起，
    跟着我们的毛主席走。
    我们有吃有穿，
    变得白胖胖，
    像泉水一般的清清爽爽，
    像珠子一样的圆亮亮。
