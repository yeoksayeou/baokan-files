International Bookstore Tianjin Branch
Scheduled to Open Today

The International Bookstore, specializing in the distribution of foreign language books, newspapers, and magazines, has played a significant role in absorbing advanced Soviet culture and introducing Marxist-Leninist theory since its establishment in Beijing on December 1, 1949. However, due to its recent founding, its domestic branches have not been widely established, and distribution work in various regions relies heavily on the assistance of Xinhua Bookstore. To date, branches have only been established in Shanghai, Hankou, Shenyang, Dalian, and Harbin. Therefore, establishing branches in major cities across the country to meet the needs of the vast readership is one of the bookstore's current priorities. Tianjin, as the largest economic center in North China, has a high concentration of factories and schools, and a large Soviet expatriate community, resulting in a significant demand for Soviet books and periodicals. After several months of active preparation, the Tianjin branch is scheduled to officially open today. This will greatly assist readers in Tianjin in learning about advanced Soviet culture.

    国际书店天津分店
    定今日开幕
    专门发行外国文书籍、报纸、杂志的国际书店，自一九四九年十二月一日在京成立了总店以来，在吸收苏联先进文化及介绍马列主义理论方面，起了极大的作用。但由于该店创立不久，国内分支机构仍未能普遍建立，在各地的发行工作，多靠新华书店的协助。迄今为止，已设分店的地方，仅有上海、汉口、沈阳、大连和哈尔滨等地。故在全国各大都市建立分支店，以满足广大读者的需要，乃是该店当前的重要任务之一。天津为华北最大经济中心，不但工厂、学校密集，苏联侨民亦多，对于苏联书刊的需求甚大。经该店几个月来积极筹备，天津分店已定于今日正式开幕。对于今后天津读者学习苏联的先进文化将有莫大帮助。
