The People of Shaoshan Village, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province
Write to Chairman Mao to Report on the New Atmosphere of Their Hometown
[Our newspaper's news] The people of Shaoshan Village, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, Chairman Mao's hometown, wrote to Chairman Mao to report on the new atmosphere in the village in the year since liberation. The original text is as follows: Dear Chairman Mao:
    We are taking the opportunity to celebrate the great first National Day to report to you on the situation in your hometown, Shaoshan Village, in the year since liberation:
    In April of last year, Mao Liangsheng, Mao Yi, and others in our village, under the leadership of the Party, launched and organized a people's guerrilla team, and more than a hundred young people in our village participated. In May, Mao Yueqiu, Mao Jun'gao, Yu Yuanshun, and others secretly initiated the establishment of a Poor Peasants' Association to scout for news, deliver food and water to the guerrilla team, and support the guerrilla struggle. In August, the People's Liberation Army, which we had been longing for, finally arrived. We immediately raised more than 80,000 jin of grain, firewood, vegetables, etc., to support the Second and Fourth Field Armies to advance to the southwest.
    During the grain requisition, under the leadership of the local Party and with everyone's support, after three weeks of investigation and evaluation, all the men and women, young and old, in the village rose up to hand in grain, and the task was completed in just over two days, exceeding the quota by 3,776 jin.
    Chairman Mao: This poor village with many mountains and little land, after years of water, drought, insect plagues, and the long-term exploitation of the Kuomintang reactionaries, faced difficulties of famine this spring and summer. In order to overcome this difficulty, under the leadership of the Party and the government, we carried out production for self-salvation, formally established a farmers' association, distributed more than 100 shi of stored grain in the village to relieve the famine, and launched a rent reduction and deposit refund movement, obtaining 723 shi of grain and more than 1,000 silver dollars, which helped us get through the spring famine. Afterwards, we all launched labor exchange and mutual assistance, repaired 163 ponds, 32 dams, and carried out pond mud as fertilizer for some of the fields and land, and promptly planted sweet potatoes, mung beans, and vegetables, which was very lively. We also organized a consumer cooperative to purchase grain in Xiangtan and Xiangxiang, which solved the problem of having money but no grain to buy, built two lime kilns, and opened up the sales channels for firewood, so that we could live off the mountains. In addition to meeting the needs of the village, some lime was sold, earning 30 shi of grain. Raising pigs has become a good sideline for us. One hundred jin of pigs can be exchanged for six shi of grain and can be sold at any time to solve the difficulties of life and production. The vegetables planted by each household were also earlier than in previous years, and the government also loaned grain three times on time, totaling 48,030 jin of rice, and also distributed 3,000 jin of relief grain. In addition, there were about 200 shi of grain originally stored in the village. In this way, all the people in our village safely got through the summer famine.
    Chairman Mao: This year we owed less than in previous years and also had a good harvest. Each mu of land yielded 2.5 dou more grain. If it were not for you and the Communist Party thinking about us in every way and finding ways for us, let alone increasing production this year, even the famine would have been impossible to get through.
    This year, each mu of field yielded 4 shi and 3 dou of grain, and some yielded even more. For example, the 28 mu of land cultivated by middle peasant Mao Renqiu yielded 4 shi and 5 dou per mu. The whole family harvested 2,950 jin more grain than last year, an average increase of 1 shi per mu compared to last year, and 5 dou more than in a good year. Chairman Mao: For many years, the reactionaries have been conscripting soldiers and seizing laborers. Natural disasters and man-made calamities have prevented us from producing properly. In our village, we have not had a good year for several years. This year, the village's 4,410 mu of land yielded 47,700 jin more grain than last year, and the miscellaneous grains (sweet potatoes, sorghum, beans, etc.) produced on newly reclaimed land are estimated to be equivalent to more than 2,000 shi of grain. Chairman Mao: "The seventh month is when the rice ripens, and the eighth month is when the wealth is counted." We have achieved this saying.
    In the past, we "mud legs" dared not ask about the affairs of the village, but now it is very different. We feel that those who are truly selfless and capable are elected to handle affairs. In July, democratic political construction was implemented. Our Shaoxi, Shaonan, and Shaobei dike areas were merged into Shaoshan Township, and ten township government members were elected to establish the township people's government. The people we elected are all farmers and other laborers. Township Chairman Sun Huixian is a poor peasant, Secretary He Yuanfu is a hired hand, and member Mao Bixiang is a middle peasant. In this way, we truly achieved the goal of our working people running their own affairs. Now men and women, young and old, have their own organizations, often gathering to study culture, policies, and discuss work. Our political and cultural level is constantly improving.
    Looking back at the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, we were inspected, questioned, detained, and persecuted when we went out. For twenty years, corrupt officials, traitors, local bullies, and evil gentry colluded with each other, causing us to live like beasts of burden. Before liberation last year, the remnants of the White bandits' Eighty-eighth Division wanted to carry out a bloody wash of Shaoshan Village. Fortunately, our People's Liberation Army won successive victories, and the heroic struggle of the guerrillas liberated Shaoshan Village before they came to harm us.
    Now it is completely different. The working comrades of the people's government came to the village, ate the same food as us, slept together, talked and laughed, and were not at all aloof, feeling like they were our own family members. Chairman Mao: We have come to the fore!
    For the liberation of the Chinese people, you have traveled north and south, braving wind and frost and risking arrows and stones, leaving your hometown for more than twenty years. You are always concerned about the working people, and I think you often care about your own hometown. The people of your hometown, like the people of the whole country, have received countless favors from you and have unspeakable gratitude. Under your wise leadership, we will continue to implement your instructions in the future and do a good job in land reform and develop production.
    Chairman Mao: Since the promulgation of the Land Reform Law, after the propaganda of the working comrades and our own study, we have understood the policy and are preparing to welcome land reform. Now the regulations on agricultural tax in the new area have been issued, which are truly fair and reasonable and take care of us so thoughtfully that even the crops harvested from wasteland are not taxed. We promise you to strive to complete the autumn grain requisition and storage task within twenty days. And in response to your call to develop production, we will do our best to ensure that no field is left uncultivated, and we will not be lazy at all in land reform. We will cultivate carefully, plant more grass seeds and autumn and winter crops, chop more firewood, and burn more lime in the winter to prepare fertilizer for next year's spring plowing, so that next year's production will be even better. We will build Shaoshan Village well. Please take care of your health and extend our dearest respects!
    The entire people of Shaoshan Village

### 湖南湘潭县韶山村人民  上书毛主席报告家乡新气象

　　湖南湘潭县韶山村人民
    上书毛主席报告家乡新气象
    【本报讯】毛主席的故乡湖南湘潭县韶山村人民上书毛主席，报告该村解放后一年来的新气象。原文如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    我们趁着庆祝伟大的第一个国庆纪念日的时候，把你的故乡韶山村解放一年来的情形报告给你：
    去年四月间，我村毛亮生、毛义等在党的领导下，发动组织人民游击队，我们村里有百多个青年参加了。五月间毛月秋、毛俊高、余元顺等又秘密发起成立贫农团，给游击队探听消息，送饭、送水，支持游击斗争。八月间盼望了好久的人民解放军终于到来了，我们马上筹借了八万多斤粮食和柴、菜等，支援二野、四野的大军向西南前进。
    征粮时，我们在当地党的领导和大家的拥护下，经过了三个星期调查评议，全村的男女老少一齐起来争先恐后的交粮，只两天多就完成了入库工作，超过三千七百七十六斤，完成了任务。
    毛主席：这个山多田少的穷村子里，经过连年水、旱、虫灾和国民党反动派的长期榨取，今年春夏间我们遭遇着灾荒的困难。为了克服这个困难，在党和政府的领导下，我们进行了生产自救，正式成立了农会，把村内的积谷发出一百多石度荒，发动群众，进行了减租退押运动，得到果实七百二十三石，光洋一千多元，度过了春荒。以后，我们大家发动换工互助，修好塘一百六十三口，坝三十二座，担出塘泥作了一部分田里和土里的肥料，及时插了红薯、点了绿豆、种了蔬菜，搞得很起劲。又组织了一个消费合作社，到湘潭、湘乡采办谷子，解决了有钱无市的粮食问题，建设了两座石灰窑，打通了柴的销路，做到靠山吃山。石灰除供给本村需要外，还卖出了一些，赚了三十多石谷子。喂猪成了我们很好的副业，一百斤的猪就可以换六石谷，随时都能卖掉，用来解决生活和生产的困难。各家种的蔬菜也比常年早些，政府又按时贷了三次贷粮，共计大米四万八千零三十斤，还发了三千斤救济粮。再加上本村原有的积谷两百上下石，这样一来，我们全村的人就平安的度过了夏荒。
    毛主席：今年我们账比往年少欠了一些，还得到了丰收，每亩田多打了二斗五升粮，没有你和共产党处处为我们打算，替我们设法，莫说今年不能增产，连饥荒也是没法子度过的。
    今年田里每亩都打得四石三斗谷，有的更多一些，如中农毛仁秋作的二十八亩田，每亩都打了四石五斗，全家比去年多收了二千九百五十斤谷，平均每亩比去年增加了一石，比常年的好年成也多打了五斗。毛主席：多年以来反动派抽丁掳夫，天灾人祸，害得我们不能好好生产，在我们村里，已经有几年没有过好年成了，而今年全村四千四百一十亩田，比起去年多出了四万七千七百多斤谷子，新开荒地生产的杂粮（红薯、高粱、豆子等），估计还可抵二千多石谷。毛主席：“七月禾熟了，八月称财老”，这句俗语我们做到了。
    过去我们这些“泥巴它”，对于村里的事，是一句也不敢过问的，如今也大大不同了，我们觉得那个真正无私又能干，就选他出来办事。七月间实行民主建政，我们韶西、韶南和韶北的湖堤，合编为韶山乡，选出了十个乡政委员，成立了乡人民政府。我们选的都是些作田种土和其他的劳动人，乡主席孙恢先是贫农，秘书贺远福是雇农，委员毛碧香是中农，这样真正做到我们劳动人民自己当家了。现在男女老少都有了自己的组织，时常集会学习文化、政策、讨论工作，我们的政治、文化水平不断的在提高。
    回想在国民党反动统治时，我们出外被检查盘问，被扣留迫害。二十年来，贪官污吏、汉奸特务、土豪劣绅，串通一气，害得我们过着牛马的生活。临到去年解放前，白匪的八十八师等残兵败将还要血洗韶山村，好在我们解放军节节胜利，游击队的英勇斗争，没有等他们来残害我们，就把韶山村解放了。
    现在完全不同了，人民政府的工作同志到了村里，和我们吃一样的饭菜，睡在一起，有讲有笑，没有一点架子，感觉和自己家里人一样。毛主席：我们出了头呵！
    为了中国人民的解放，你披风霜冒矢石奔走南北离开桑梓，已经二十几年了，你时刻都在关心着劳动人民，想你也时常关怀着自己的故乡。你的故乡人民像全国人民一样都受了你数不尽的恩情，有说不出的感激，在你的英明领导下，我们以后要继续执行你的指示，作好土地改革工作发展生产的工作。
    毛主席：自从土改法令公布后，经过了工作同志的宣传和我们自己的学习，我们懂得了政策，正在准备迎接土地改革，现在新区农业税的条例又发下来了，真正公平合理，对我们照顾真周到，连开荒收得的作物都不征税。我们向你提出保证在二十天之内争取完成秋征入库的任务。并且响应你发展生产的号召，在土地改革中我们随时做到不荒一丘田，不偷一点懒，精耕细作，多种草子和秋冬作物，在冬天里多砍柴、多烧石灰，准备明年春耕的肥料，使明年的生产越发好起来。把韶山村建设好。请为我们保重身体，谨致最亲爱的敬礼！
    　　　　　　　　　　韶山村全体人民上
