　　A Young Female Worker Learns to Do Union Leadership Work
　　Beijing Garment Factory No. 1 female worker Li Shumin
　　How exciting is the great National Day of October 1st! Look, in this year, except for Taiwan and Tibet, the entire Chinese territory has been liberated, and all the Chinese people have gained freedom. Our women have also stood up from thousands of years of feudal oppression. The government has given us equal political status with men, and we are no longer subjected to bullying.
　　As for myself, in this year, under the education and cultivation of the Party, I have recognized the position of women in the new society and clarified that as long as you are willing to work hard, you will succeed regardless of your educational level. Last year, I was still a very timid girl, always afraid to speak when I saw strangers. All I knew was to go to work and do my job, and go home after work. I dared not stand out for anything. Last May, the factory sent me to the Municipal Party Committee Cadre Training Class for forty days, which made me understand the Party and establish a revolutionary outlook on life. I knew that I should serve the people. In August, when I was elected as the branch chairman in the Third Factory, I was panicked, feeling that I knew nothing, how could I do leadership work? Comrade Ge Chun from the factory trade union often came to the branch to tell me how to do work and encouraged me. She said, "No one knows how to do any work right away. You must practice to do a good job. If you don't know, just ask, and the leadership will definitely help you." The fellow workers in the factory also said to me, "Go ahead and do it. If you don't do well, we will all help you." Especially Comrade Wang Yukui, the labor protection committee member, saw that I was anxious and said, "You can ask me to do anything, I am not afraid of difficulties." He managed the meals very well, and the fellow workers were very satisfied with the meals. Thanks to the cultivation of the superiors and the encouragement of the masses, I had confidence in my work and realized that as long as I rely on the masses, consult with everyone, and stand firm on the workers' position, things will eventually be done well. In these two months, I have only just begun to get a handle on the work.
　　But in October, our factory merged with the First Factory, and the number of people increased more than threefold. There were also many male comrades, and I became afraid again. I thought: I am a little girl, how can I lead so many people? I didn't dare to continue doing it. Later, after ideological struggle, I felt that the leadership valued me so much, and the masses elected me. If I didn't do well, how could I be worthy of the revolution? So I decided to continue doing it. But because of my weak working ability, few methods, unclear division of labor, I didn't encourage everyone to do the work. I was grabbing everything, and as a result, nothing was done well, and I was completely trapped in the circle of事務 [administrative]ism, without spending any time going down to the workshops. Although the various committees were established, I didn't think of ways to promote the work. For example, when the production committee was making summer clothes, it led everyone to set production plans, but only made arrangements without helping to check, so the小组长 [group leaders] with strong abilities set the plans very well, and the plans of those with weak abilities became just a formality. The publicity and education work also did not play its due role, and everything was behind schedule, with little incentive for production. I also didn't actively think of ways to mobilize everyone to write articles and publish blackboard newspapers. Later, after the summer clothes were finished, these problems were found out. So, the various committees were clearly divided, and the inspection work was implemented, and the work became very easy to promote. For example, the cultural and educational work is now particularly active. The blackboard newspaper can report production experience and the production mood of each班 [shift] in a timely manner every day, and with the addition of cartoons, everyone pays great attention to the blackboard newspaper. The production committee can now also summarize production achievements in a timely manner, announce them to the outside world, and encourage production. The work in this period can be said to be much more advanced than in the past. Now I have basically jumped out of the circle of 事務 [administrative]ism, and I can spare a time every day to go to the workshop, understand the actual situation, and help solve problems at any time. Although I still have many shortcomings, I will try my best to overcome them and continue to improve the work.
　　In short, in this year, although I have not made great progress, compared with the old society, I have simply changed into two different people. I can only thank Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. If it were not for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party to turn us over, I would still be a timid girl, how could I have learned to do leadership work like today! I can only serve the people faithfully, do my best, not be afraid of difficulties, and complete the tasks given to me by the Party, to repay Chairman Mao and the Communist Party for their kindness to me.

　　一个小女工学会做工会领导工作
    北京被服一厂女工  李淑敏
    十月一日这个伟大的国庆日，是多么使人兴奋啊！看，在这一年当中，除台湾、西藏外，整个的中国领土都已解放，全中国的人民都得到了自由，我们妇女也从数千年的封建压迫之下站起来了，政府给了我们与男子同等的政治地位，再也不受气了。
    就我自己来讲，在这一年当中，在党的教育培养下，使我认清了新社会中妇女所占的地位，明确了对一件事只要你肯去埋头苦干，不管文化高低终会成功的。去年的我还是一个很怯弱的女孩子，见到生人总是不敢说话，一天就知道上工做活，下工回家，什么都不敢出头。去年五月厂方送我到市委干训班学习了四十天，使我对党有了认识，树立了革命人生观。知道应该为人民服务。八月，我在三厂被选为分会主任时，自己内心像油浇一样的恐慌，觉得自己什么也不会，如何能做领导工作呢？本厂工会葛纯同志经常到分会告诉我怎样做工作，鼓励我。她说：“什么工作谁也不是一做就会的，必须锻炼才能做好工作。不知道，只管问，领导上一定会帮助你的。”厂里的工友们也都对我说：“你作吧，做不好时我们大家帮助你。”尤其是劳保委员王玉奎同志，看到我着急，就说：“你有什么事，都可以叫我去干，我决不怕难。”他把伙食办得非常好，工友们对伙食非常满意。由于上级的培养，群众的鼓励，使我对工作有了信心，认识到只要依靠群众，同大家商量，站稳工人立场，事情终会做好的。在这两个多月当中，我做工作才初步的摸着了门。
    但十月间我们的厂就和一厂合并，人数比原来增加了三倍多，又有许多男同志，又害怕起来了。我想：自己是一个小女孩子，怎能做这么许多人的领导工作呢？我又不敢往下再做了。后来经过思想斗争，觉得领导上这样看重我，群众把我选出来，要是做得不好，那怎么对得起革命呢？所以决心还是做下去。但由于工作能力弱，办法少，分工不明确，没有推动大家来做工作。自己整天东抓一把，西抓一把，结果这也没有做好，那也没有做好，整个陷在事务主义的圈子里，没有花费一点时间下到工房里去。各委员会虽然建立起来，但没有想办法去推动工作，如生产委员会在做夏服时领导大家订生产计划，只是布置下去，也不知道去帮助检查，因此小组长能力强的就把计划订得很好，能力弱的计划订出来就变成形式了。宣教工作也是没有起到应有的作用，什么都走在后头，对生产鼓动性不大，也不知道积极想办法发动大家写稿子、办黑板报。后来夏服做完了，把这些毛病找了出来，于是，各委员会都明确分了工，实行检查工作，工作推动起来也就很容易了。如文教工作现在特别活跃，黑板报每天都能及时的报道生产经验和各班的生产情绪，再加上有漫画衬托，大家对黑板报就非常注意了。生产委员会现在也能及时总结生产成绩，向外公布，鼓励生产。这一段的工作比过去可说是进步了很多。现在我已基本上跳出了事务主义的圈子，每天可以腾出一个时间到工房，可以了解实际情况，随时帮助解决问题。虽然我的缺点还很多，但是我一定尽量克服，使工作继续提高一步。
    总之，在这一年当中，我虽然没有大的进步，但是比起旧社会的我，简直变了两样。我现在只有感谢毛主席和共产党，如果没有毛主席和共产党使我们翻了身，还不是一个怯弱的女孩子，那能会象今天这样学会了做领导工作呢！我只有忠实地为人民服务，尽我一切的力量，不怕困难，完成党所给予我的任务，来报答毛主席和共产党给我的恩惠。
