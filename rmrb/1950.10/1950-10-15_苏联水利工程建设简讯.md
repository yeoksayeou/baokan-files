　　Brief News on Soviet Water Conservancy Project Construction
    The surveying and design work for the three major Soviet hydroelectric power stations, Kuibyshev, Stalingrad, and Kakhovka, is ready. As the water levels of the Volga and Dnieper rivers will be greatly raised, many new large ports and forty docks will be built in Stavropol, Kazan, and other places in the Kuibyshev reservoir area. The Stalingrad reservoir will have four large ports and dozens of docks built in Stalingrad, Volsk, and other places. The same construction project will also be carried out in the Kakhovka reservoir area. The loading and unloading equipment for these ports and docks will be fully mechanized.
    After the construction of the new reservoirs is completed, new-style ships with extremely large cargo capacity will be able to navigate the Volga and Dnieper rivers. Since the navigating ships need proper protection, special ports will be built in windy areas with large waves. Automatic electric lighthouses and other signals will be set up along the coast, so that ships can see the light of the lighthouses, which are up to sixty meters high, from twenty to thirty miles away.
    In the construction of hydropower stations and the Turkmenistan, South Ukraine, and North Crimea canals, all difficult earthworks, such as building dikes, levees, and excavating canals, will use powerful Soviet-made excavators, pumps, and other special equipment. Each excavator can replace two thousand people and can excavate one thousand cubic meters of soil per hour.
    The area irrigated by the Kakhovka Hydropower Station and the South Ukraine and North Crimea canals is much larger than several European countries such as the Netherlands and Switzerland. The primary task of Soviet power engineers at present is to master long-distance high-voltage power transmission for industrial use and to design new electric tractors and other machines in order to implement large-scale agricultural electrification in these areas.
    A huge industrial city will be built on the construction site of the giant sluice of the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station. According to the original plan, the new city's apartments, buildings, and schools must be completed this year, but the workers have decided to shorten the construction time. Not far away, on the shore of the "Kuibyshev Sea," a small port town has been established, surrounded by ancient pines on three sides, with beautiful scenery; it is part of that new city.

　　苏联水利工程建设简讯
    苏联古比雪夫、斯大林格勒和卡霍夫卡三大水力发电站的勘测和设计工作已准备就绪。由于伏尔加河及第聂伯河的水位将大大提高，古比雪夫蓄水池将在斯塔夫罗波尔、喀山等地建筑许多新的大港埠和四十个码头。斯大林格勒蓄水池将分别在斯大林格勒、伏尔斯克等地建筑四个大港埠和数十个码头。卡霍夫卡蓄水池也将进行同样的建设工程。这些港埠码头的装卸设备，均将全部机械化。
    新的蓄水池建造完成后，伏尔加河与第聂伯河上将可航行载货量极大的新式轮船。由于航行的船只需要适当的保护，因此要在多风涛的地带建筑特别的港口。沿岸将设立自动电力的灯塔和其他的信号，使船只在二三十里以外即可看到高达六十公尺的灯塔光芒。
    在建造水电站及土库曼和南乌克兰及北克里米亚运河的工程中，一切困难的土工，例如建筑河堤、水堤与开掘运河等，均将使用苏联制造的强大的开凿抽水机和其他特殊设备。每一具开凿抽水机可代替两千人，每一小时可掘出一千立方公尺的泥土。
    卡霍夫卡水电站、南乌克兰和北克里米亚两运河所灌溉的区域，比欧洲的若干国家如荷兰、瑞士还要大得多。苏联动力工程师目前的首要任务，就是精通工业用的长距离的高压输电工作，并设计新式的电气拖拉机及其他机器，以便在这些地区大规模实行农业电气化。
    在古比雪夫水电站的巨型水闸的建筑现场上，将建设一个巨大的工业城市。根据原定计划，新城市的公寓、大厦和学校必须在今年内落成，但工人们已决定缩短建筑时间。在不远的地方，“古比雪夫海”的岸边，已建立了一座小型的港口城镇，三面环绕着古松，风景幽美，它是那座新城的一部分。
