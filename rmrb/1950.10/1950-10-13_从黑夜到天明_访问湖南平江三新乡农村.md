　　From Darkness to Dawn
    Visiting the Rural Areas of Sanxin Township, Pingjiang, Hunan

    Sanxin Township in the First District of Pingjiang was an old revolutionary base during the land revolution era. The Chinese Communist Party once led the peasants here to establish their own political power and distribute the land of landlords. In the winter of 1930, counter-revolutionary forces attacked, and the Red Army withdrew from this area. The Kuomintang and the landlord class resumed their exploitation and rule over the people, and the land distributed to the peasants was taken back by the landlords. From then on, the "Self-Defense Corps" (landlord armed forces) and the "Volunteer Corps" (reactionary armed forces) carried out inhumane persecution of the peasants, killing countless people and burning countless houses; however, the people of Sanxin Township did not succumb to this. They buried their hatred deep in their hearts, and they always held a strong belief: "The Kuomintang will not last long no matter what, and the Communist Party will return one day."

    Yearning for the moon and the stars, in July last year, the people's own army—the People's Liberation Army—returned as expected.

    (1) Digging out the Martyrs' Monument from the Soil

    The People's Liberation Army arrived in Sanxin Township on July 18th last year. The next day, the local masses dug out a martyrs' tombstone buried in the Zhang family cemetery, inscribed with "Tomb of Martyr Zhu Zhang" and a commemorative inscription.

    Comrade Zhu Zhang was one of the many revolutionary heroes and heroines murdered by Kuomintang executioners. During the Great Revolution, he was the secretary of the Communist Youth League County Committee of Pingjiang. He was arrested and imprisoned in the spring of 1927. The reactionaries subjected him to coercion, enticement, and torture more than ten times, but he never yielded. The reactionaries then beheaded him at Yuetang Pond in the city. When he was escorted to the execution ground, he shouted revolutionary slogans and died heroically. He was only nineteen years old at the time. His body was buried in the Zhang family cemetery, more than three miles away from the county seat.

    In 1930, when the Red Army was still in Pingjiang, the Communist Party members of the entire county erected a stone tablet in front of the tomb of Martyr Zhu Zhang, inscribed with oaths such as "Those who come after should work harder" to commemorate him; and more than a thousand local people held a memorial service in front of the tomb. In the winter, when the main force of the Red Army withdrew, the local people, fearing that the reactionaries would destroy Comrade Zhu Zhang's tomb, piled a pile of firewood on the tomb to cover the tombstone. After more than a year, the firewood had rotted, and the Red Army had not yet returned, so they changed to using bricks and soil to seal the tombstone, agreeing not to reveal a single word about the tombstone. For twenty years, the reactionaries never discovered this. This tombstone sealed with bricks and soil became a beacon for the local people, watching for the victorious tomorrow, encouraging and strengthening everyone's courage and confidence in the arduous struggle. Now that the Communist Party has returned, they have dismantled the bricks and soil that they themselves had built twenty years ago, allowing the tombstone of Martyr Zhu Zhang to see the sun again.

    (2) Demolishing "Bunkers" and Digging "Roads"

    After the Red Army left Pingjiang, the Kuomintang reactionary government built many bunkers in various places to control the revolutionary activities of the masses. Sanxin Township was very close to the city, so even more bunkers were built, a total of eleven. At that time, they were all built by forcing the conscription of laborers. Some of the kiln bricks used to build the bunkers were taken from the walls of the homes of ordinary people, especially the walls of the homes of revolutionary martyrs, and the pavilion at the ferry of Tanjiapo River was also dismantled to build the bunkers. After the bunkers were built, the masses did not dare to go near them to take a look. Once, Ling Jian, a worker at a tofu shop in Sanyang Street, went to Duanjiachong to buy pigs, and passed by a bunker. He curiously went up to take a look and was heavily slapped twice by the bandit soldiers in the bunker, and they detained him, saying he was a "bandit." For twenty years, these bunkers, like malignant tumors, poisoned the people of Sanxin Township. When the local people saw these shameful bunkers, the fire of hatred burned in their hearts.

    In November last year, Sanxin Township launched a campaign to repair ponds and dams. The local masses demolished four brick-built bunkers. In February this year, the peasant association led the masses to demolish the remaining seven cement bunkers. After the bunkers were demolished, the masses felt as relaxed and happy as if a malignant tumor had been cut off.

    In 1943, Yang Sen's troops of the reactionary faction were stationed in Pingjiang, and the cavalry company was stationed in the Zhong family's mansion and the Zhong family's ancestral hall in Sanxin Township. The bandit army built a road more than two li long and more than seven feet wide from the Zhong family's ancestral hall to Sanyang Street, destroying more than 200 dan of paddy fields (equivalent to more than 40 mu). The poor peasant Lai Linqing's family had more than 30 dan of paddy fields destroyed. At that time, it was August, and buckwheat had just been planted in the fields. When the bandit soldiers carried shovels to dig up the fields, Lai Linqing knelt in the fields and begged bitterly, but the bandit soldiers kicked him away with a series of punches and kicks. Under the strong coercion of the bandit army, more than 40 mu of fertile land became the cavalry company's road. When Yang Sen's cavalry team charged back and forth on the newly built road, more than 20 peasant families lost their land as a result, living a life of hunger and displacement. Lai Linqing's family was forced to sell even their door panels to eat. In 1944, the Japanese invaded this area, and Yang Sen's troops fled. In 1945, the Japanese also left, and the peasants demanded that the road be restored to fields, but the reactionary government said that this was public land and was not allowed to be dug up and destroyed. Some peasants managed to raise some money and send it to the officials of the reactionary government before they were allowed to dig it up and turn it into fields; but there were still a few families who could not afford the money, so they had to leave the land there barren, not daring to touch it.

    After liberation, this road has been completely destroyed and has once again become patches of fields, and the peasants are once again freely cultivating their own land. But in their hearts, they will never forget that this road once made them live a long and difficult life.

    (3) The Days of Turmoil Are Over

    When Yang Sen's cavalry team was stationed in Sanxin Township, more than 200 horses charged back and forth in the fields all day long, trampling on the rice seedlings in the fields and eating up the small tea bushes in the gardens. The peasant Li Tianfu described the scene of that year: "The roads were all trampled on by the horses." Once, Lai Dunxiang saw horses eating rice in his field, so he ran to drive them away, but he was beaten with two horse whips by Yang Sen's soldiers and detained in the headquarters. He had to say all the good words and pay all the attention to clear up this big trouble. The grass that the peasants fed their cattle was all eaten up by the cavalry team. Once, Lai Yancheng hid the rice straw on the roof, but it was also searched and taken away. He had to spend a high price to buy grass from a place more than ten li away to feed his cattle. The cavalry team was initially stationed in Zhongjia Wuchang, and the masses were so disturbed that they complained: "With Zhongjia Wuchang's big house, the people within a few li are all suffering." Later, the cavalry team moved to the Zhong family's ancestral hall. The people of Zhongjia Wuchang were angered, fearing that the cavalry team would come again, so they demolished the large hall in the middle (where the horses were tied) (the family of Martyr Zhu Zhang lived in Zhongjia Wuchang, and this house has not yet been repaired). At that time, a sad folk song was circulating in the local area:

    "Ox plows the fields, horses eat the seedlings, the peasants weep.
    Rather have the Japanese come to kill, than Yang Sen's troops to stay!"

    Before the liberation last year, Chiang Kai-shek's 58th Army was stationed in Pingjiang, which was even worse than Yang Sen's troops, causing turmoil in the local area. They would arrest anyone they saw and snatch anything they saw. The peasants did not dare to work in the fields during the day and could only do it secretly at night. Now? The peasants of Sanxin Township have obtained a peaceful and quiet environment that they never dreamed of. They cultivate freely, rest freely, without oppression, without fear.

    The poor peasant Lai Tingcong pointed to an old windmill that had just been repaired and said to us: "Yang Sen's troops tied the horses to the windmill, smashing it to pieces. It was left upstairs for several years before it was taken out a few days ago to be repaired. Alas, I don't know how many times I cried for Yang Sen's horses back then. Now it's good, I can concentrate on production during the day and sleep peacefully at night."

    (4) A Victorious Harvest

    After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the peasants of Sanxin Township overcame various difficulties and overcame various disasters. Now, a victorious harvest has appeared in Sanxin Township. The output of medium rice in the whole township has increased by more than 10% compared with last year, and it is estimated that at least 600 dan of grain can be increased. The newly reclaimed 6 mu of wasteland has also harvested 42 dan of grain, and the newly reclaimed 100 mu of wasteland has all been planted with sweet potatoes, cotton, sesame, etc. The peasant Li Tianfu's family only harvested 40 dan of grain last year, but this year he harvested 50 dan. He said with a smile: "Such a bumper harvest has not been seen in more than ten years."

    After the peasants harvested the medium rice, they immediately carried out plowing and planting of autumn crops. The township government and the peasant association put forward the slogan: "Dress, plow, and plant in the fall, strive for another good winter harvest." On the third day after the rich middle peasant Liu Yubin's family finished threshing, all of the more than 100 dan of paddy fields were plowed and planted with buckwheat and sorghum.

    (5) Grateful to Chairman Mao

    The peasants looked at piles of golden rice, looked at the sweet potatoes and cotton that were growing vigorously in the newly reclaimed wasteland, and felt unspeakable joy and gratitude. They all understood in their hearts: "Without Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, there would never be today."

    After the peasants harvested the grain, they invested their fruits in production, some buying cattle, some buying fertilizer, and some buying plows. The poor peasant Li Gugui in Duliu Village was forced to sell all his property and went bankrupt before liberation. He had to transfer his fields to others to cultivate, send his two children to live in his mother-in-law's house, his wife went out to work as a female worker, and he worked as a long-term worker for others. In February this year, Sanxin Township carried out rent reduction, so he came back, reduced the 9.5 dan of deposit grain, plus the 5 dan of grain wages he brought back, he took back the fields to cultivate himself, and his wife and children also brought him back. He worked particularly hard in production, and this year's harvest was very good, a total of 48 dan of grain. He used the new grain to make a windmill, a small granary, and three pieces of rice drying mats, and he also bought a cow with others. A few days ago, he spent 20,000 yuan to buy back 11 wooden strips, preparing to build a pigsty. He said to us very gratefully: "When I came back in February this year, there were only two buckets and a broken pot in the house, and the bed was borrowed from others. Now? The family is barely looking like a family, If Chairman Mao hadn't come to save me and turn me over, where would I be today? Soon the land will be distributed, and I am really happy. After the land is distributed, I must step up production and plant two crops of fields. If I don't work hard in production now that I have turned over, then I will be too sorry for Chairman Mao." Many such turned-over peasants in Sanxin Township as Li Gugui have Chairman Mao in their hearts at all times.

### 从黑夜到天明  访问湖南平江三新乡农村

　　从黑夜到天明
    访问湖南平江三新乡农村
    平江一区三新乡是土地革命时代的老根据地。中国共产党曾经在这里领导农民建立过自己的政权、分配过地主的土地。一九三○年冬，反革命势力进攻，红军便撤离了这个地区。国民党和地主阶级又恢复了对人民的剥削和统治，农民分得的土地，又被地主们夺回去了。从此“挨户团”（地主武装）和“义勇队”（反动派武装）向农民进行着惨无人道的迫害，杀了不知多少人，烧了不知多少房屋；但是，三新乡的人民并没有因此屈服，他们把仇恨深深的埋藏在心里，他们始终抱着坚强的信念：“国民党无论如何不会长久，共产党总有一天会回来的。”
    盼月亮，盼星星，去年七月间，人民自己的队伍——解放军果然回来了。
    （一）从泥土里挖出烈士碑
    人民解放军是去年七月十八日到达三新乡的，第二天当地群众便把埋藏在张家坟场上的一块烈士墓碑挖了出来，上面刻着“烈士朱璋之墓”，并刻有纪念碑文。
    朱璋同志是被国民党刽子手杀害的许多革命英雄儿女之一。大革命时候，他是平江的少共县委书记。一九二七年春天被捕入狱。反动派向他威迫利诱、酷刑拷问过十余次，但是他始终不屈。反动派便把他砍杀在城内月池塘。押赴刑场时，他高呼革命口号，慷慨就义。当时他还只有十九岁。尸身葬在离县城三里余的张家坟场。
    一九三○年红军还在平江时，全县的共产党员在朱璋烈士的墓前立了一块石碑，上面刻着“来者当更努力”等誓词，以作纪念；并有当地群众一千余人在坟前开了追悼会。冬天红军主力撤离时，当地群众怕反动派破坏朱璋同志墓，在坟上堆了一堆柴草把墓碑掩盖起来。时间过了一年多，柴草已经腐烂，红军还没有回来，他们便改用砖土把碑封砌起来，相约不许吐露半句关于墓碑的消息。二十年来，反动派始终没有发觉这件事。这一座用砖土封砌的墓碑，便成了当地群众守望着胜利的明天的灯塔，在艰难的斗争紧张的岁月，鼓舞与坚定了大家斗争的勇气与信心。现在共产党回来了，他们便拆开二十年前自己砌上的砖土，让朱璋烈士的墓碑重见太阳了。
    （二）拆“碉堡”、挖“马路”
    红军离开平江后，国民党反动政府在各地修建了许多碉堡，控制群众的革命活动。三新乡离城很近，所以修建的碉堡更多，共有十一座。当时都是强迫征派民工修成的。修建碉堡的窑砖有些是拆的老百姓家里的墙，特别是革命烈士家里的墙，谈家坡河边渡口的凉亭也拆来砌了碉堡。碉堡修成后，群众不敢走拢去瞧一眼，有一次三阳街上一家豆腐店的工人凌鉴，到段家冲去买猪，路过碉堡，他好奇地走拢去看了一眼，被碉堡里的匪军重重的打了两个耳光，并把他扣起来，说他是“土匪”。二十年来，这些碉堡，就象毒瘤一样，毒害着三新乡的人民。当地群众一看到这些可耻的碉堡，心头就燃起了仇恨的烈火。
    去年十一月间，三新乡发动修整塘坝，当地群众便拆毁了四座用砖砌的碉堡，今年二月间，农会又领导群众拆掉了其余的七座洋灰碉堡。拆了碉堡后，群众感到象割掉了一块毒瘤样的轻松愉快。
    一九四三年，反动派杨森的部队驻扎在平江，骑兵连扎在三新乡的钟家大屋和钟家祠堂。匪军从钟家祠堂到三阳街修了一条两里多长七尺多宽的大马路，毁了两百多石谷田（约等于四十余亩）。贫农赖林卿家被毁了三十多石谷田。那时正是八月间，田里刚刚种上荞麦。当匪军背着铲子来挖田的时候，赖林卿跪在田里苦苦哀求，匪军们一阵拳打脚踢把他踢开了。在匪军的强力逼迫下，四十多亩良田变成了骑兵连的马路。当杨森的马队在新修的马路上横冲直撞的时候，二十多户农民的家里便因此失去了土地，过着饥饿流离的生活。赖林卿家逼得没办法，把门板也拆下来卖掉吃光了。一九四四年，日本人侵陷了这个地区，杨森的部队逃走了。一九四五年，日本人也走了，农民们要求将马路恢复成田，但是反动政府说这是公家的地基，不准挖毁。有的农民设法凑了些钱送给反动政府的官员，才让挖成田；但是还有几家拿不起钱的，便只好让地在那里荒着，不敢去动。
    解放后，这条马路已全部毁了，又变了一丘一丘的田，农民们又自由自在地在自己的田地里耕种着。但是他们的心里，永远不会忘记那一条马路曾使他们长期的过着苦难的岁月。
    （三）鸡犬不宁的日子过去了
    当杨森的马队驻在三新乡的时候，两百多匹马成天在田里横冲直撞，田里的禾苗被践踏，园里的小茶被吃光。农民李添福形容当年的情景说：“路都被马踩的冒得（没有）了。”有一次，赖趸香看到马在自己的田里吃禾，便跑去赶开，被杨森的士兵打了两马棍，并把他扣到司令部，后来说尽好话，赔尽小心，才了清这场大祸。农民家里喂牛的草都被马队吃光。有一次赖彦成把稻草藏在楼顶上也被搜走了。他只好花很高的价到十多里外的地方去买回草来给自己的牛吃。骑兵队起初是驻在钟家屋场，群众被骚扰得没有办法，便埋怨：“有了钟家屋场咯（这）栋大房子，连累几里路内的百姓都遭殃。”后来骑马队移驻钟家祠堂去了。钟家屋场的人恼了火，怕马队再来扎，便把正中那一间大堂屋（拴马的）拆掉了（朱璋烈士的家属就是住在钟家屋场的，这间屋至今仍未修复）。那时候，地方上流传着这样一首沉痛的民谣：
    “牛耕田马吃秧，农民泪汪汪。
    宁愿日本人来杀，不愿杨森的队伍扎！”
    去年解放前，蒋匪军五十八军驻扎平江，比杨森的部队还坏，闹得地方上鸡犬不宁。见人就抓，见物就抢。农民白天不敢到田里做工，只能晚上偷偷摸摸地去做一做。现在呢？三新乡的农民得到了一个梦想不到的和平安静的环境，他们自由地耕种，自由地安息，没有压迫，没有恐惧。
    贫农赖听聪指着一部刚修补好的旧风车对我们说：“杨森的部队把马拴在风车上，撞得稀烂，在楼上搁了好几年，早几天才拿出来整好。唉，那时候，我为着杨森的马不晓得哭了好多回。现在好了，白天安心生产，夜里安心睡觉。”
    （四）胜利的丰收
    解放后，三新乡的农民在共产党和人民政府的领导下，克服了各种困难，战胜了各种灾害，现在，一个胜利的丰收已经在三新乡出现了。全乡的中稻产量比去年增加一成以上，估计至少可增产谷子六百石，新开出的荒田六亩也收了四十二石谷，新开的一百余亩荒土都种了红薯、棉花、芝麻等。农民李添福家，去年只收了四十石谷，今年却收了五十石，他笑眯眯地说：“这样的丰收是十多年来没看见过的。”
    农民们收割了中稻后，便马上进行犁田布种秋作物，乡政府和农会提出号召：“边扮边犁边种秋，争取再来一个好冬收。”富裕中农刘虞斌家打完谷后的第三天，一百多石谷田便全部犁好了，并布上了荞麦和高粱。
    （五）感激毛主席
    农民们看着一堆堆金黄的稻谷，看着新开的荒土里正在蓬蓬勃勃长起来的红薯和棉花，心里说不出的高兴和感激，他们心里都明白：“没有毛主席和共产党是绝对不会有今天的。”
    农民们收割了谷子后，纷纷将果实投向生产，有的买牛，有的买肥料，有的买犁懦?Ｆ杜├罟裙笫墙衲甓?录洳呕厝?孪缋吹模?夥徘肮?竦吵樽扯。?逼得倾家荡产，把田也转让给别人种，把两个小孩寄住岳母家，妻子出外做女工，自己便给别人做长工。今年二月间，三新乡进行减租，他便回来了，减回了九石五斗押金谷，加上自己带回的五石谷工资，便把田收转来自己种，妻子和小孩也接回来了。他生产特别努力，今年的收成很好，共扮了四十八石谷，他用新谷制了一张风车，一间小谷仓，三张晒谷的簟子，又和别人合伙买了一条牛，早几天，又花两万元买回十一根木条子，准备起一间猪栏屋。他很感激地向我们说：“我今年二月间回来时，家里只有两个桶和一个破锅，床铺都是向别人借的。现在呢？家里也勉强象个样子了，不是毛主席来救我翻身，那里有今天呢？不久就要分田了，心里真高兴，分了田以后，我一定要加紧生产，种两道的田，我要种三道，打了早禾插晚禾，打了晚禾又种麦子，做到三种三收。现在翻了身，我如果不努力生产，那就太对不住毛主席了。”三新乡许许多多象李谷贵这样的翻身农民，他们的心里时刻记着毛主席。
