    Strive to Achieve a Nationwide Popularization of Improved Seed Varieties Within Five Years: Seed Selection Campaigns Unfold Across East China

East China's farmers are universally launching autumn seed selection campaigns during the harvest season to realize the plan of popularizing improved varieties nationwide within five years. Currently, the seed selection work for early autumn crops in various regions has concluded, and they are actively proceeding with seed selection for cotton and late rice.

People's Governments at all levels in various regions attach great importance to this autumn's seed selection work. Before the autumn harvest, People's Governments at all levels in Shandong Province established or strengthened seed selection committees at all levels and universally convened symposiums of village-level cadres, labor models, and peasant activists to summarize the experience of wheat season seed selection and further study the methods and standards for autumn seed selection. During the autumn seed selection period, the South Jiangsu People's Administrative Office dispatched more than 100 agricultural technicians to various seed selection areas in South Jiangsu to assist farmers in seed selection. In the rural areas of Jinhua Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, seed selection groups were established in various counties to promote seed selection work in various villages.

During seed selection, farmers in East China have gradually paid attention to adopting field selection methods. For example, in Jiaozhou Prefecture, Shandong Province, seed selection households account for 80 to 90 percent of the total number of households, and more than half of these households implement field selection. In early rice seed selection in various parts of Zhejiang Province, many farmers adopted the method of field exhibitions, widely soliciting opinions, conducting evaluations in the field, and repeatedly inspecting the varieties reserved in the field. During the harvest, they also made efforts to eliminate inferior and mixed varieties, threshing and storing them separately to maintain the purity of improved varieties. When selecting seeds, state-owned farms and improved variety promotion areas mobilized surrounding farmers to visit the sites in person, educating farmers to further recognize the benefits of seed selection and learn seed selection methods.

Many excellent varieties have been selected in the seed selection campaign in various regions. For example, farmers in Jiaozhou Prefecture, Shandong Province, selected 27 excellent grain varieties such as "Qingnong No. 21" and nine sorghum varieties such as "Bamboo Pole Green" and "Ox Heart High". These improved seeds each have a certain capacity to resist drought, waterlogging, wind, and pests and diseases, and their yields are 10 to 20 percent higher than ordinary varieties. The excellent rice variety "Victory Xian," selected by farmers in northern Jiangsu and the suburbs of Jiangning, increases production by about 30 percent compared to ordinary rice varieties. After the selection of improved seeds, state-owned seed companies in various regions, in addition to vigorously promoting farmers' own seed retention and mutual seed exchange, also systematically purchase improved seeds in preparation for promotion next year.

### 争取实现五年内普及良种计划  华东各地展开选种运动

　　争取实现五年内普及良种计划
    华东各地展开选种运动
    【新华社上海九日电】华东各地农民为实现五年内普及优良品种的计划，在秋收中普遍展开秋季选种运动。现各地早秋作物的选种工作已告结束，正积极进行棉花和晚稻的选种。
    各地人民政府对今秋的选种工作都很重视。山东省各级人民政府在秋收前均建立或加强了各级选种委员会，普遍召开村级干部、劳动模范和农民积极分子座谈会，从总结麦季选种经验，进而研究了秋季选种的方法和标准。苏南人民行政公署在秋季选种期间，派出农业技术干部一百多人，分赴苏南各选种区，协助农民进行选种。浙江省金华专区各县农村都建立了选种小组，推动各村的选种工作。
    在选种时，华东各地农民已逐渐注意采用田间选种的方法。如山东胶州专区各县选种户占总户数百分之八十到九十，其中有一半以上的户数实行田间选种。浙江省各地农民在早稻选种中，很多是采取田间展览会的方式，广泛征集意见，在田间进行评选，并反复检查田间所留品种。在收获时，又做到去劣去杂，单打单藏，以保持良种的纯度。各国营农场和良种推广区在选种时，则动员周围农民实地参观，教育农民进一步认识到选种的好处和学会选种的方法。
    各地在选种运动中，评选出很多的优良品种。如山东胶州专区农民即选出“青农二十一号”等二十七种优良谷种和“竹杆青”、“牛心高”等九种高粱品种。这些优良种子，各具有一定的抗旱、抗涝、抗风和抗病虫害的能力，而且产量都比一般品种高出百分之十到二十。苏北和江宁近郊农民所评出的优良稻种“胜利籼”，则要比普通稻种的产量增加三成左右。优良种子选出后，各地国营种子公司除大力推动农民自己留种和互相换种外，并有计划地进行良种收购，以备明年推广。
