　　Defending World Peace is the Obligation of Educators
    Liao Shicheng
    Yuan Yishan wrote in a poem: "Wars are like trivial conflicts, the universe is stained with blood every day." Since the Second World War, the wounds in various places have not yet healed. Except for the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries, which are working hard on production and construction, many people around the world are still in dire straits. The American imperialists and their puppet states are manipulating the United Nations, inciting war, carrying out barbaric aggression against Korea, and frantically bombing it. They are also violating our airspace, interfering with our sea lanes, and preventing us from liberating Taiwan, seriously threatening and undermining world peace and security. The American imperialists' perverse actions will undoubtedly arouse the indignation of peace-loving people all over the world and strengthen their unity.
    We are educators, and in order to protect the interests of the working class and our position, to implement the New Democratic education, and to take care of the happiness of children and young people, we should unite to oppose the expansion of armaments, reduce education and health expenditures, persecute progressive teachers, and undermine the peace movement. We should unite workers, youth, and women all over the world, regardless of political belief, regardless of gender or age, to resist war, uphold peace, and fight to the end!

　　保卫世界和平是教育工作者应尽的义务
    廖世承
    元遗山诗云：“干戈几蛮触，宇宙日流血。”自从第二次世界大战以后，各地创伤，尚未恢复，除了苏联及新民主国家正在努力生产从事建设以外，全世界不少人民尚在水深火热之中，而美帝及其仆从国家又在操纵联合国，煽动战争，对朝鲜进行野蛮的侵略，疯狂地轰炸，并侵犯我领空，干涉我航路，阻挠我解放台湾，严重地威胁与破坏着世界的和平与安全。美帝这种倒行逆施的行动，无疑地更激起全世界爱好和平的人民的愤慨，更加强他们的团结。
    我们是教育工作者，为了保障工人阶级的利益和我们的地位，为了实施新民主主义的教育，为了照顾儿童和青年的幸福，我们应当一致起来，反对扩张军备，缩减教育及卫生经费，迫害进步教师及破坏和平运动。我们应当联合全世界的工人、青年和妇女，不分政治信仰，不分男女老幼，一致反抗战争，拥护和平，奋斗到底！
