Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai cabled the United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie, and forwarded it to the President of the Fifth UN General Assembly, Mr. Andrien, and the President of the Security Council, Mr. Austin, on the 28th, regarding the intrusion of U.S. military aircraft into the coastal area of Shandong Province this month on the 7th and 14th, conducting low-altitude reconnaissance and strafing our fishing boats. He strongly protested the U.S. government's atrocities of invading our coastal areas and once again filed a complaint with the United Nations, demanding that the Security Council immediately take effective measures to stop this act of aggression and withdraw the U.S. armed forces invading our territory Taiwan and our neighboring country Korea. The cable reads as follows:

Mr. Trygve Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations, Lake Success, New York, and forwarded to Mr. Andrien, President of the Fifth UN General Assembly, and Mr. Austin, President of the Security Council:

According to reports from my East China Military and Political Committee, at 13:30 on October 7th, a U.S. aircraft intruded into the northeast of Chanshan Head, more than 100 nautical miles northeast of Qingdao, and carried out strafing; subsequently, it conducted low-altitude reconnaissance along Shidao (13:50), Chengshan Head, Weihaiwei (14:30), and Fushan (16:00). At 10:00 on October 14th, another U.S. aircraft strafed the No. 10 fishing boat of the Yantai Aquatic Products Company on the Shandong sea.

The repeated intrusion of U.S. military aircraft into Chinese airspace for reconnaissance and strafing, and the attack on our fishing boats at sea, prove that the U.S. government is expanding its atrocities of invading Taiwan and violating our Northeast airspace to invading our coastal areas. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. I, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, lodge a serious protest against this act of aggression by the U.S. military aircraft, and once again lodge a complaint and demand to the United Nations: The United Nations Security Council should immediately take effective measures to stop this act of aggression and withdraw the U.S. armed forces invading our territory Taiwan and our neighboring country Korea, which is a matter of utmost urgency.

Foreign Minister of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai
October 28, 1950, in Beijing

　　周外长致电联合国
    控诉美机犯我山东沿海
    要求立即撤退美国侵略台湾朝鲜的武装
    【新华社二十八日讯】美国军用飞机于本月七日和十四日侵入我国山东省沿海，肆行低空侦察并扫射我渔船。外交部周恩来部长为此于二十八日致电联合国秘书长赖伊，并转联合国第五届大会主席安迪让及安理会主席奥斯汀，严重抗议美国政府侵犯我国沿海一带的暴行，并再次向联合国提出控诉，要求安理会立即采取有效措施，制止美国这种侵略行为，并撤退美国侵略我国领土台湾及我国邻邦朝鲜的武装力量。电文如下：美国纽约成功湖联合国秘书长赖伊先生，并转联合国第五届大会主席安迪让先生及安全理事会主席奥斯汀先生：
    根据我华东军政委员会报告，十月七日十三时三十分，有美国飞机一架侵入我青岛东北一百余海里的巉山头东北，实行扫射；继沿石岛（十三时五十分）成山头、威海卫（十四时三十分），福山（十六时）作低空侦察。十月十四日十时又有美国飞机一架向我山东海面上烟台水产公司十号渔船扫射。
    美国军用飞机一再侵入中国领空，进行侦察扫射，并在海面袭击我渔船，证明美国政府正在把侵略我台湾及侵犯我东北领空的暴行扩大到侵犯我国沿海一带，这是中国人民所绝不能容忍的。我代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府对美国军用飞机的这种侵略暴行，提出严重抗议，并再次向联合国提出控诉和要求：联合国安全理事会应立即采取有效措施，制止美国这种侵略行为，并撤退美国侵略我国领土台湾及我国邻邦朝鲜的武装力量，实为迫不容缓之举。
