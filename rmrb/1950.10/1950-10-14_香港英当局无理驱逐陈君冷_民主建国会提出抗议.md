　　Hong Kong British Authorities Unreasonably Expel Chen Junleng
    Democratic National Construction Association Protests
    [Our Newspaper] The Democratic National Construction Association issued a protest regarding the unreasonable expulsion of Chen Junleng, a standing director of its Hong Kong and Kowloon branch, by the Hong Kong British authorities. Excerpts from the protest letter:
    It is reported by our association's Hong Kong and Kowloon branch that on September 27th, the Hong Kong authorities forced Chen Junleng, a standing director of our Hong Kong and Kowloon branch, to leave the country immediately. The reason is that after Chen Junleng led overseas Chinese to return to the country for sightseeing, he repeatedly reported to various legal entities about the unprecedented unity and progress of the motherland, which had a great impact. Recently, he also led overseas Chinese in preparing to enthusiastically celebrate the motherland's National Day, which aroused the jealousy of the Hong Kong authorities, who unreasonably expelled him.
    Chen Junleng is one of the leading figures in the Hong Kong and Kowloon industrial and commercial circles. His expulsion is due to the British colonialists' consistent political discrimination against the Chinese people, their jealousy of the People's Republic of China, and their open interference in the celebration of their own motherland's National Day by the Chinese people in Hong Kong. From this, it can be seen that although Britain has superficially recognized the People's Republic of China, it is still colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and is hostile to the Chinese people.
    This extremely unfriendly behavior of the Hong Kong authorities is unacceptable to the Chinese people, especially all members of our association, Chinese national industrialists and businessmen, and overseas Chinese! Our association first lodges a serious protest with the British government and the Hong Kong authorities, demanding that the expulsion order against Chen Junleng be revoked immediately, that an apology be made to Chen Junleng, and that it be guaranteed that the same unreasonable incident will not occur again.

　　香港英当局无理驱逐陈君冷
    民主建国会提出抗议
    【本报讯】民主建国会为该会港九分会常务理事陈君冷被香港英国当局无理驱逐出境，特发表抗议。抗议书中略称：
    兹据本会港九分会报告：香港当局于九月二十七日迫令我港九分会常务理事陈君冷立即出境，原因是陈君冷领导侨胞回国观光之后，多次向各法团报告祖国空前团结进步的盛况，所起的影响很大；最近他又领导着侨胞准备热烈庆祝祖国国庆，招致香港当局的嫉视，蛮不讲理的予以驱逐。
    陈君冷是港九工商界领袖人物之一。他被驱逐出境，是由于英国殖民主义者在政治上一贯的歧视中国人民，嫉视中华人民共和国，以至公然干涉在港中国人民庆祝自己祖国的国庆。由此可见，尽管英国在表面上承认了中华人民共和国，实际上依然和蒋匪帮勾结一起，与中国人民为敌。
    香港当局这种极不友好的行为，是中国人民尤其是本会全体会员和中国民族工商业者以及海外侨胞所一致不能忍受的！本会首先向英国政府及香港当局提出严重的抗议，要求立即撤销对陈君冷的驱逐令，向陈君冷道歉，并保证以后不再发生同样的无理事件。（丁国桢）
