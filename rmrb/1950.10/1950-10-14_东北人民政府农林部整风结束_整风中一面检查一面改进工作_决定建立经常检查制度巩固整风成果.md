　　Northeast People's Government Department of Agriculture and Forestry Ends Rectification
    Inspecting and Improving Work Simultaneously During Rectification
    Decision to Establish Regular Inspection System to Consolidate Rectification Achievements
    [This News Report] According to Northeast Daily news: The Northeast People's Government Department of Agriculture and Forestry's rectification has now been successfully completed, and the work of various divisions and bureaus has greatly improved. During the three-month rectification process, the leading departments of each division and bureau basically implemented the rectification policy of focusing on key points, having specific goals, and starting with inspecting and summarizing the current main tasks. Through professional meetings and responsible cadres conducting in-depth on-site inspections, they summarized the work of each division and bureau, formulated improvement plans, and work has already begun to change.
  In-depth on-site inspections, widely soliciting farmers' opinions, and improving the promotion of new agricultural tools.
    The Agriculture Division, which is specifically responsible for the promotion of new agricultural tools, summarized the shortcomings in this year's promotion work at the technical promotion meeting and determined the promotion policy for next year. It then sent out inspection teams composed of more than 30 cadres to Heilongjiang and Songjiang provinces to further inspect the Western plows and shovel cultivators that have a greater effect and promotional value. The inspection teams widely solicited the opinions of cadres at all levels and farmers, repeatedly experimented in various places for two months, and concentrated the advantages of the agricultural tools manufactured in each province this year to create standard-sized samples of these two types of agricultural tools. In late September, the inspection teams convened a meeting of promotion staff from each province to re-experiment and research, and finally determined the specifications and quality. In this way, next year's promotion work can avoid or minimize loopholes. At the same time, based on the lessons learned from the promotion work in the spring and summer of this year, attention was also paid to strengthening the inspection of new agricultural tools for autumn harvest; the finished products were strictly inspected according to the established specifications.
  Rectification combined with wheat harvest work, wheat harvest efficiency increased fivefold compared to last year.
    After conducting a general inspection within the organization, the Publicly Operated Farm Administration Bureau immediately sent responsible cadres to the various farms to convey the spirit of rectification, inspect and help arrange wheat harvest preparations, so that rectification was closely combined with the important task of wheat harvest. All farms accepted the lessons learned from last year's insufficient preparations, which caused great losses. Before harvesting, they carried out a series of preparatory work: detailed repairs of combine harvesters, holding combine operator training classes, opening wheat drying yards, etc.; so that the wheat harvest could be completed smoothly and work efficiency was improved. Last year, Tongbei Farm harvested 1,300 hectares of land in a total of 23 days, while this year it harvested 1,100 hectares in only 7 days: the harvest at Heshan Farm took a whole month last year, but only 5 days this year, with efficiency increasing fivefold. Due to the good preparatory work, the loss rate was also greatly reduced. Last year, the field loss of wheat was 20% to 45%, while this year it averaged only 3%, with a minimum of only 1.5%.
    One of the key points of the department's rectification, the Water Conservancy Bureau, found that one of the main problems was that river management projects did not focus on key areas. When formulating the improvement plan, the bureau discussed and studied in detail the river conditions in Northeast China and the effectiveness of existing water conservancy facilities, and determined a clear policy for 1951 and within three years. In the work of formulating plans, the defect found was that there were only preliminary plans without detailed engineering designs, and some plans were only made after the completion of the project; while the characteristics of water conservancy work plans are: after having a preliminary plan, it must go through surveying, measurement, and design before a detailed engineering plan can be formulated. During the rectification, this lesson was immediately accepted, and preliminary plans for 1951 were made, and surveying, measurement, and design could be started in October. In addition, the bureau also found that this year's scope and standards for the review of engineering plans were not clear, resulting in many reviews becoming formalistic—the project was completed, and the plan was only approved then. Therefore, detailed rules for review work were formulated. Specific regulations were made for the review standards and scope. The projects to be reviewed by the General Bureau have now been sent to people for on-site inspection.
  After rectification, the work direction and tasks are clear and specific, and the enthusiasm of cadres has increased.
    Because the work has been improved after the rectification, and the direction and tasks are clearer and more specific than in the past, all departments, from responsible comrades to general cadres, have improved their work enthusiasm. The Water Conservancy Bureau even solved the relationship between party members and the masses through this rectification.
    Based on the problems found by various departments, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry has made a comprehensive summary of one year's work and a plan for the 1951 production plan. This plan was discussed at the meeting of directors of agriculture and forestry departments held on October 4, and will be used as preparation for next year's work.
  Main experience: Leaders personally responsible, in-depth on-site inspections.
    The Department of Agriculture and Forestry has gained the following basic experiences in this rectification: First, the leadership must closely monitor and conduct regular inspections during the rectification process. Only in this way can deviations be corrected in a timely manner and policies and instructions be correctly implemented. Du Zheheng and Wei Zhenwu, the two ministers of the department, convened responsible cadres from various divisions and bureaus every certain period to report on the rectification, and promptly gave instructions to correct deviations, making the understanding of the cadres of the divisions and bureaus clearer. For example, at the beginning, the deviation of the Agriculture Division focusing on studying documents and drilling into terms in isolation without focusing on inspecting work was corrected; at the last report, it was pointed out that the Publicly Operated Farm Administration Bureau should not only summarize the successful experience of this year's wheat harvest, but also examine the complacency of leaders at all levels. Second, leaders personally responsible and conducting in-depth on-site inspections are effective ways to discover problems, solve problems in a timely manner, and improve work. In-depth inspection of work during rectification not only does not hinder the current tense work tasks, but is closely integrated with the current urgent work, making these tasks better done. If you close the door and inspect vaguely and generally, it will inevitably be superficial and not specific. As for why leaders must go down personally, it is because they have a higher ideological level than general cadres and can more profoundly and keenly discover problems and solve them in a timely manner. The reason why the rectification of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry has been carried out well and many problems have been found is that the ministers and division chiefs personally went down to inspect the work, which is a main reason. Third, only by starting from inspecting work and studying work can problems such as uniting cadres and uniting technical personnel be solved. At the beginning of the rectification, some departments closed the door and rectified relationships in isolation, with no results after a week. However, the Water Conservancy Bureau united all cadres and technical personnel by studying work together, which was more effective.
    Based on the results of this rectification, the department has decided to establish a regular inspection system to implement the rectification results in future work. The department is also compiling a booklet on agricultural technical issues and this year's agricultural production summary, which will be used as teaching materials during the winter training of county, district, and village cadres. It also stipulates that personnel of subordinate agencies should study the rectification summary and next year's work plan to ensure that the rectification results are truly implemented in actual work.

　　东北人民政府农林部整风结束
    整风中一面检查一面改进工作
    决定建立经常检查制度巩固整风成果
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：东北人民政府农林部的整风现已圆满结束，各处、局工作有了很大改进。该部在三个月的整风过程中，各处、局领导部门基本上都贯彻了有重点、有目的、从检查总结当前主要工作着手的整风方针，通过专业会议和负责干部深入现地检查，总结了各处、局的工作，制订了改进方案，工作已有转变。
  深入现地检查，普遍征求农民意见，改进新农具推广工作。
    具体负责新农具推广工作的农业处，在技术推广会议上总结了今年推广工作中的缺点，确定了明年的推广方针之后，即派出三十多个干部组成的检查小组，到黑龙江、松江两省进一步检查作用较大、有推广价值的洋犁和铲趟机。检查小组普遍征求了各级干部和农民群众的意见，在各地反复试验了两个月，集中了各省今年所造农具的优点，把这两种农具做出标准规格的样品。九月下旬，检查小组又召集各省推广工作人员开会，再次试验、研究，最后确定了规格、质量。这样，明年的推广工作就可以少出以至不出漏洞。同时，根据今年春夏两季推广工作的教训，对秋收用的新农具也注意了加强检查；做出的成品，都按照既定规格严格验收。
  整风与麦收工作结合进行，麦收效率较去年提高了五倍。
    公营农场管理局在机关内部做了一般检查之后，负责干部当即深入到各农场去，传达整风精神，检查并帮助布置麦收准备工作，使整风与做好紧张的麦收工作紧密结合起来。各农场都接受了去年准备工作不充分、造成很大损失的教训，在收割之前，进行了一系列的准备工作：详细地检修了康拜因机，开办康拜因手训练班，开辟晒麦场等；使麦收得以顺利完成，并提高了工作效率。去年通北农场一千三百垧地，共割二十三天，今年一千一百垧七天即割完：鹤山农场的收割，去年整整用了一个月今年只用了五天，效率提高了五倍。由于准备工作做的好，损失率也大大减低，去年小麦田间损失为百分之二十到四十五，今年平均只损失百分之三，最低只百分之一点五。
    该部整风重点之一的水利局，检查出的主要问题之一是治河工程没有抓住重点。在拟订改进方案时就详细讨论研究了东北的河流情况及已有水利设施的效益，确定了一九五一年及三年以内的明确方针。在拟订计划的工作中，检查出来的缺点是只有初步计划没有详细的工程设计，有的是在工程修完之后才做计划；而水利工作计划的特点是：有了初步计划之后，必须经过勘察、测量、设计再拟出详细的工程计划。整风中遂即接受这一教训，做好了一九五一年的初步计划，十月份就可动手勘察、测量、设计。此外，该局又检查出今年对工程计划的审核范围、标准都不明确，致使许多审核成为形式主义——工程已完，计划才批准。因此，拟订了审核工作细则。对审核标准和范围都做了具体规定。由总局负责审核的工程，现已派人下去实地勘察。
  整风后工作方针任务明确具体，干部工作积极性提高。
    因为整风后工作得到改进，方针、任务又比过去明确、具体，各部门从负责同志到一般干部都提高了工作积极性。水利局更通过这次整风解决了党员和群众的关系问题。
    根据各部门检查出的问题，农林部已做出了一年工作的全面总结及一九五一年生产计划的方案。该计划方案在十月四日召开的农林厅长会议上讨论后，即做为明年工作的准备。
  主要经验：首长亲自负责，深入现地检查。
    农林部在这次整风当中获得了这样几条基本经验：一、整风过程中领导上必须抓紧作经常检查。这样才能及时纠正偏差，正确贯彻方针指示。该部杜者蘅、魏震五两部长，每隔一定时期就召集各处、局负责干部汇报整风，及时予以指示，纠正偏向，使处、局干部的认识更加明确。譬如开始时曾纠正了农业处孤立地学文件钻名词而不以检查工作为主的偏向；最后一次汇报时，曾指出公营农场管理局除了总结今年麦收的成功经验外，还应检查各级领导干部的自满情绪。二、首长亲自负责，深入现地检查，是发现问题、及时解决问题改进工作的有效办法。整风中深入下去检查工作，不仅不妨碍当前紧张的工作任务，反而与当前紧要工作密切结合起来，使这些工作做得更好。如果关起门来孤立地泛泛地检查，必然不深刻不具体。至于必须首长亲自下去，是因为他们比一般干部具有较高的思想水平，能够比较深刻、敏锐地发现问题并及时地解决问题。农林部整风所以进行的较好，检查出许多问题，部长、处长亲自下去检查工作是一主要原因。三、只有从检查工作、研究工作入手，才能解决团结干部、团结技术人员等问题。有的部门在整风开始时，关上门孤立地整关系，整了一个星期毫无结果。而水利局通过与全体干部、技术人员一齐研究工作来团结他们，收效就比较大。
    根据这次整风结果，该部决定建立经常的检查制度，把整风成果贯彻到今后工作中去。该部并把农业技术问题及今年农业生产总结编成小册子，准备在冬季轮训县、区、村干部时，作为教材。并规定所属机关人员学习整风总结及明年工作方案，保证把整风成果真正贯彻到实际工作中去。
