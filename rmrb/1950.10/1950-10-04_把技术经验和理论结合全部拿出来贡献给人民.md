　　Contribute All Technical Experience and Theory to the People
    Industrial Model Worker Representative Yu Songru
    This time I was selected as a representative of national model workers, and I feel it is the greatest honor of my life. This makes me realize more profoundly that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can engineering and technical personnel have the opportunity to obtain such glory.
    I am an engineering person who struggled in the old society for two or three decades, and I have endured all kinds of treachery, oppression, and exploitation. The bureaucratic capitalists at that time treated us with treacherous means. For example, if a factory's mechanical equipment had problems, they would be willing to hire you with generous treatment, but after you solved the problem for them, they could immediately turn their faces, reduce your salary, or even dismiss you unceremoniously. There was no talk of any glory! After suffering multiple blows, I developed a concept of aversion to society, but at that time, due to a lack of political thought, I did not know how to fight against the darkness of the old society, and it only evolved into a passive style of selling technology according to treatment. But doing so still could not escape the trap of being exploited by them. After liberation, I realized that relying only on technology without understanding politics does not make a complete person, and I deeply believed in the greatness of the masses' strength. Seeing that the revolutionary work cadres were diligent and thrifty, always thinking of the people, and could humbly accept the opinions of the masses, gave me a deep sense of emotion and encouragement. I understood the significance of the revolution and realized the important tasks that our engineering personnel should undertake during economic construction. I thought: the technical experience accumulated over many years should now be fully contributed to the people.
    However, the technology of engineering personnel is mostly book theory, and theory must be combined with practice to achieve good results in work. And because theory is a record of past labor, and the record of labor is constantly changing, if one relies only on the outdated theory in books without combining it with practical work, one will inevitably commit the error of "doctrinairism." If one relies only on practical work and lacks theoretical leadership, a lot of labor will be wasted. Therefore, theory must be entirely infused into practical work, and practical work must be used to supplement the shortcomings of theory. Only in this way can the work be done well and excellent results be obtained. After I understood these principles, I mobilized the workers and masses to study and create turbine steam inlet blades with them and improve boilers and other work. In these works, there are many examples that confirm the correctness of what I thought. For example, when manufacturing the steam inlet of the No. 1 turbine (made by Hitachi, Japan), the volume of the original damaged steam inlet was about three times larger than the raw material we prepared (2.5-inch diameter nickel-chromium steel). In the absence of an air hammer to thicken the raw material and because of time constraints we could not wait to melt and cast the raw material, there was only one way to use gas welding. In theory, this method is "welding is possible by using a neutral flame and correctly grasping the technology," but how can we correctly grasp the technology? This requires practical work to supplement it. At the beginning, welding was done many times, and it cracked as soon as it was welded. As a result, veteran technician Tang Yanzhang suggested putting the steel in coke to burn it red, and then using the nickel-chromium steel itself as a welding rod, first welding an inch or so on the top, and then welding an inch or so on the bottom, repeating this process until it was successful. This fully proves that theory is combined with practice, and practice has supplemented new theory. It can also prove the great power of the workers and masses, which can overcome any difficulties.
    Improving boilers and overhauling turbines is my responsibility and my obligation. I did not expect to be selected as a representative of national model workers because of this. From this incident, I also realized that under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as one is capable and willing to work, one will never be buried. This understanding made me love the Communist Party more ardently and strengthened my belief that "striving to join the Party is the greatest glory." At the same time, I lamented that the backwardness of China's industry was caused by the old society. Take the technical personnel as an example. In the past, they were suppressed everywhere, and there was absolutely no opportunity to research, discuss, and exchange experiences with each other. Therefore, many theories are outdated and inapplicable, and many works dare not be carried out freely. This is caused by the old society. Now, the time has come for our engineering personnel to study technology and contribute technology. As long as we are willing to work, we can get support and assistance from all aspects. As long as we are willing to contribute technology to the people, the people will give us more opportunities to research and develop technology. I hope that all engineering personnel comrades will unite and strive for the fundamental improvement of the economic situation of the new China.

　　把技术经验和理论结合全部拿出来贡献给人民
    工业劳模代表  于松如
    这次我被选为全国劳动模范代表，感到是有生以来最大的荣幸。由此，使我更深刻地认清，只有在共产党领导之下，工程技术人员们才有获得这样光荣的机会。
    我是一个在旧社会里挣扎了二三十年的工程人员，饱经了险诈压迫和剥削，那时的官僚资本家们全是以谲诈手段对待我们，譬如某一工厂机械设备发生问题，他肯用优厚待遇聘请你，但等到你给他把问题解决之后，他马上可以向你板起面孔，裁减你的薪酬，甚或毫不客气地解聘，那里还谈得到什么光荣啊！我在受到了多次打击之后，曾发生出对社会厌恶的观念，但那时由于缺乏政治思想，不知和旧社会的黑暗去作斗争，仅演变成按待遇出卖技术的消极作风，而这样做的结果，仍然脱不掉受他们剥削的圈套。解放后，我才了解到只靠技术而不懂政治，不能算是一个完全的人，并且深刻地相信了群众力量的伟大，看到革命工作干部都是勤劳俭朴，处处为人民设想，能虚心接受群众意见，更给了我很深的感动和鼓舞。我了解了革命的意义，觉悟到我们工程人员们在经济建设期间应尽的重大任务，我想：蕴藏多年的技术经验，现在应该全部拿出来贡献给人民了。
    但是，工程人员们的技术，多半是书本上的理论，而理论必须与实际结合起来，才能使工作收到良好效果。又因为理论是历来劳动的纪录，而劳动纪录又是日新月异的，若仅恃书本上的陈腐理论不结合实际工作，必犯“教条主义”的错误，若只凭实际工作而缺乏理论领导时，亦将浪费很多的劳动力。所以理论要整个灌注到实际工作中去，同时要用实际工作来补充理论的不足，必须这样，才能使工作作得好，才能得到优良的成绩。我把这些道理搞清楚之后，便发动职工群众，和他们一起研究创造透平机汽口汽叶，并改进锅炉等工作。在这些工作中，有很多例子，证实了我想的道理的正确，例如当制造一号透平机（日本日立制）汽口时，原来已坏的汽口体积较我们预备的原料（二英寸半直径的镍铬钢）约大三倍，在缺乏气压锤，不能将原料撙粗和因时间关系等不及将原料熔化试铸的情况下，只有用汽焊焊接的一个办法，这办法在理论上讲是“利用中性焰，正确掌握技术时，可能焊接”，但怎样才能正确掌握技术呢？这就须用实际工作来补充了，起初焊接多次，都是随焊随裂，结果老技术工友唐彦章出主意，把钢放在焦炭中烧红后，再用镍铬钢本身材料作焊棍，先焊上面寸许，再焊下面寸许，如此反复焊接，始告成功，这充分地证明了理论结合了实际，而实际又给补充了新的理论，更可证明职工群众伟大的力量，是能够克服任何困难的。
    我改进锅炉，检修透平机，是我应尽的责任，也是我应尽的义务，没有想到竟因此而被选为全国劳动模范代表，从这事我又认识到在共产党领导之下，只要能干肯干，决不埋没人才的。由这认识，使我对共产党发生了更热烈的爱戴，更加强了我“争取入党才是最大的光荣”的信念。同时我感慨到我们中国工业的所以落后，都是旧社会给造成的，就拿技术人员们来说，从前处处受压制，绝没有互相研究讨论交流经验的机会，所以很多的理论都陈旧不适用了，很多的工作不敢放手去作，这是旧社会造成的。现在，我们工程人员们研究技术贡献技术的时候来了，只要我们肯干，就能得到各方面的支持和协助，只要我们肯把技术贡献给人民，人民会给我们以更多研究发扬技术的机会，我希望全体工程人员同志们一致起来为新中国的经济状况基本好转而奋斗。
