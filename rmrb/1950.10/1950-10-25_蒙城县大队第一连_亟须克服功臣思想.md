    Mengcheng County Brigade, First Company
    Urgently Needs to Overcome the Mentality of Being a Hero
    Comrade Editor:
    The First Company of the Mengcheng County Brigade in northern Anhui was formed by upgrading various district teams. Because the brigade leadership failed to conduct proper education, Fang, the company commander, developed a mentality of being a hero, which led to lax discipline in the company. On the evening of September 2nd, during a model selection meeting held by the county party committee, the company disrupted the order of the meeting and deliberately pushed and shoved. County Head Lü told them not to push. He, the platoon leader, not only refused to listen but also started arguing loudly. When he left the venue, he cursed, saying, "At most, I'll be confined for a few days!" Later, the company's soldiers insisted on drawing water from a well in the county government compound (the well had just been repaired and was not yet ready for use). When County Head Lü passed by, he told the soldier, "Be careful not to damage it." The soldier said, "What else do you need to do to draw water?" His attitude was very bad. The squad leader not only did not stop him but also said to County Head Lü, "The soldier is not wrong!"

    On another occasion, Feng, the director of the Public Security Bureau, passed by the company's gate. Company Commander Fang actually said, "What is Director Feng! We won the world, he has only been a soldier for a few days!" Company Commander Fang often scolded the soldiers and said, "You can't succeed without beating them." On a certain day in August, when the company's soldiers had a dispute with the Public Security Bureau's security team, Fang Daoyi, the company commander, personally directed the soldiers to beat up the security team in front of the county party committee. Zhu Ming, the armed forces minister of the county party committee, and Yue Lin, the secretary of the Youth League, went to mediate, but Company Commander Fang said rudely, "It's none of your business!" Comrade Shao Guang, the secretary of the county party committee, asked him to make a self-criticism. He then flaunted his seniority and said that he would only make a self-criticism if they dared to arrest him.

    Comrade Fang Daoyi's arrogant and self-important mentality of considering himself a hero is caused by the brigade leadership's protection and accommodation of him. The brigade leadership knew about these things a long time ago, but they emphasized the lack of cadres and relaxed their education. It is hoped that the county brigade will examine its own leadership ideology and strengthen the unit's discipline education to correct these bad tendencies.

### 蒙城县大队第一连  亟须克服功臣思想

　　蒙城县大队第一连
    亟须克服功臣思想编者同志：
    皖北蒙城县大队第一连，是由各区队升编的。由于大队领导上未能很好进行教育，使该连方连长滋长了功臣思想，使连队的纪律松弛。九月二日晚，在县委召开的选模晚会上，该连不守会场秩序，故意挤轧。吕县长叫他们不要挤。排附何某不但不听，反而大吵起来。当他离开会场时骂着说：“顶多蹲几天禁闭！”后来，该连战士硬要到县府院子里的水井打水（水井刚修好，还不能用）。吕县长经过时告诉那个战士说：“小心，别弄坏了。”战士说：“打井不用干啥？”态度很不好。班长不但不加制止，反而向吕县长说：“战士没有错！”
    另一次，公安局冯局长经过该连门前。方连长竟说：“冯局长算什么！天下是老子打下来的，他才当几天兵！”方连长对战士经常谩骂，并说：“不打不成。”八月某日，该连战士与公安局保卫队发生纠纷时，方道义连长竟在县委门前亲自指挥战士将保卫队打了一顿。县委武装部长朱明及青年团书记岳林前去调处，方连长蛮横地说：“你们管不着！”县委书记邵光同志要他检讨。他又摆老资格，说如敢把他押起来他就检讨。
    方道义同志这种骄傲自大、以功臣自居的思想，是由于县大队领导上对他包庇迁就所造成的。这些事情大队领导上早都知道了，但他们强调干部缺乏，就放松了对他们的教育。希望县大队检讨本身的领导思想，加强部队的纪律教育，以纠正不良倾向。
