　　Launch an Autumn Afforestation Campaign
    Wang Lin, Tong XinFu

    Afforestation in the three seasons of the year has its own characteristics, but experience has proven that planting trees in late autumn and early winter is the best; the survival rate is high, and they grow vigorously. Although some areas are not yet accustomed to autumn afforestation, many areas have had the habit of autumn afforestation in the past and have considerable experience. Therefore, at this autumn season, it is necessary to seize the season, give full play to the favorable conditions for autumn afforestation, absorb and improve past afforestation experiences, and continue to carry out a mass afforestation movement.
    1.  Benefits of autumn afforestation:
    (1) Easy to survive: After the trees shed their leaves, between late autumn and early winter before the earth freezes, the trees begin to dormant, and the sap activity is slow. After the saplings are planted, they are closely attached to the soil throughout the winter. When the soil thaws, it is moist; before germination, the roots take root first, which can fully supply nutrients and moisture. After germination, they will not suffer from spring drought, and naturally they will survive easily. In the former Jizhong District, 736,000 trees were planted in the autumn of 1948, with a survival rate of 90%, while only 60% of the trees planted in the spring survived. Jia Lanhufu, the afforestation model who attended the National Model Workers Congress, said that he led the entire village in his hometown of Gujun Village in Xingtang County, Hebei Province, to afforest in three seasons every year. In the past ten years, more than 400,000 trees have been planted, among which the autumn tree planting has the best results. At the Suiyuan Provincial Forestry Cadre Conference in June this year, everyone unanimously reflected that although Sui Province has high and cold terrain, it has the habit of afforestation after autumn, and its effect is better than spring afforestation. Forestry expert Ren Chengtong once introduced the method of planting willow branches by the masses along the Yellow River in Suiyuan for many years, that is, before the beginning of winter freezing, cut the thin willow branches into five or six inches long, plough them into ditches in the wet beach, and then sow the small willow branches in the ditches, and then cover the soil with two or three fingers thick, and they will grow out in clusters next spring, saving seedlings and labor, and it is simple and easy to implement. It is also a good way to build mother tree forests, and it is applicable everywhere.
    (2) Growing vigorously: After autumn, the saplings and branches have sufficient nutrients, and planting seedlings, layering, and inserting branches all have the strength to germinate and take root. Because the roots are rooted first and then germinate, the foundation is solid and the branches are flourishing; in addition, because the climate is cold, germs and pests will not invade the wounds of the tree seedlings; all seedlings after autumn accumulate sufficient nutrients after the leaves fall, and when the spring comes, the germination and growth will be earlier and more vigorous, and they will not be afraid of spring drought.
    (3) Tree seedlings and tree seeds are easy to find: There are many people who trim trees after autumn, and the cut willow branches are very good tree seedlings, especially many tree seedlings and fruit seedlings are bred everywhere every year, and it is good to use these wild seedlings for afforestation after autumn. At this time, the growth of trees stops, and it is convenient for long-distance transfer and adjustment. In addition, most of the tree seeds mature after autumn, which is easy to collect, and various fruit pits are also easy to find. Sowing afforestation or raising seedlings will also germinate normally and be neat and strong in spring after softening in winter.
    (4) Fruit pits and tree seeds are easy to survive: Such as peaches, apricots, walnuts, hawthorns and other large-grain hard-grain seeds, because the outer skin is hard or contains wax, and moisture is not easy to penetrate, it is best to plant them in autumn to spend the winter. After the tree seeds freeze and melt in the soil, very thin cracks are squeezed out on the hard grains, so that they can absorb water and germinate very early in the second year. Therefore, it is best to carry out autumn planting for raising seedlings or afforestation on barren hills with hard-grain seeds. In particular, oak and oak species are suitable for early autumn sowing on forested mountains, which can take root in the same year and emerge from the soil next spring. For example, the autumn-sown oak seeds of the Dongling Afforestation Bureau in Hebei Province last year had a germination and survival rate of over 90%. It is the main tree species for afforestation in North China and Northwest China in the future, but it should be sown with the collection in autumn, and should not be stored for too long or sown after the beginning of spring.
    (5) Utilizing the slack farming season: The one-and-a-half months from Frost's Descent to Light Snow is the slack farming season, which is not as busy as spring, and it is easier to grasp the time than afforestation in the rainy season. Therefore, this period can be fully utilized to adjust tree seedlings and mass afforestation. If the masses can be well mobilized to plant trees in autumn, the results can exceed those in spring and rainy seasons. According to incomplete statistics in Hebei Province last year, 88,953,283 trees were planted throughout the year, and 55,000,000 trees were planted in autumn.
    2.  Several issues to be noted in terms of technology
    (1) When planting trees in dry sandy land, layering after autumn, the dug soil should be piled on the north side of the pit, and the branches should be placed in the pit (two feet deep) and close to the north side of the pit. Do not plant it in the middle of the hole. This method also comes from the practical experience of the afforestation model Jia Lanhufu; because there is little moisture in the dry sandy wasteland, digging a pit will inevitably reduce the moisture in the sand even more. However, planting the tree seedlings close to the north side is more likely to survive because one side of the sand is not moved and retains more moisture. Planting the tree seedlings in the middle of the pit will not easily survive. In addition, it can also be used to block the wind and sand blowing in spring and winter, maintain suitable sunlight, and easily take root. When burying the soil, it is necessary to smash the soil from the south side of the pit to fill the pit, and then leave a small pool to facilitate water storage and snow storage; it can also block the fine sand or rotten grass leaves that are scraped, and turn them into natural fertilizer. For willow layering, two large strips should be placed in each pit, and four small strips should be placed, and it is not appropriate to squeeze a large handful of strips together and press them down. Too long strips should be cut into two sections, the thin end is layered, and the thick end is made by planting pegs, which saves seedlings and is easy to survive (seedlings with pegs or roots can be left alone after being sealed with sand for the second year). In addition, the most important thing is to master the four secrets of "deep burial, solid smashing, less exposure, and dense planting".
    (2) For one-year-old locust and other seedlings that are afraid of freezing, it is best to dig up the seedlings after the leaves fall and hide them in the cellar or bury them in the soil, and then dig them out for planting when they germinate next spring, and they will no longer be damaged by freezing in the future. If planting after autumn, cut the dry soil mound.
    (3) After autumn, when building windbreak forest belts or forest networks, first shovel away the dry soil on the surface of the planting area, then dig pits, put all the soil on the windy side (west or north), put the trees into the pits, and then fill them with the wet soil around the pits and tamp them. In this way, the windward side becomes a wall, which can store winter snow and block wind and sand.
    In short, autumn is the most important season for afforestation in the three seasons of the year, and we should vigorously promote it. In areas where there are already habits, it is necessary to mobilize the broad masses to take action and improve on the existing basis, so that the quantity and quality of afforestation will continue to expand and improve. In areas where there are no habits, we must also start with key demonstrations and gradually develop them, so that our afforestation work can be rapidly advanced.

　　开展秋季造林运动
    王林　佟新夫
    一年三季造林，各有其特点，但经验证明以秋末冬初植树造林为最好；成活率高，长的也旺盛。目前虽然有些地区尚不习惯于秋季造林，但过去许多地区已有秋季造林习惯，且有相当经验。所以，值此秋令之际，要抓紧季节，充分发挥秋季造林的有利条件，吸取与提高过去造林的经验，继续开展一个群众性的造林运动。
    一、秋季造林的好处：
    （一）容易活：树木落叶后，大地冻结前的秋末冬初之间，树木开始休眠，树液活动缓慢。树苗栽上后经过一冬和土的密贴，当解冻以后，土壤湿润；发芽前根部先扎根，可以充分供应养料和水分，发芽后又不致受春旱之害，自然容易成活。前冀中区，一九四八年秋季植树七十三万六千株，成活率为百分之九十，而春季植树只活了百分之六十。这次出席全国劳模代表大会的造林模范贾兰虎说：他在家乡的河北行唐县故郡村领导全村每年三季造林，这十年来已造成四十余万株，其中以秋季栽树的成绩为最好。今年六月绥远省林业干部会议上，大家一致反映：绥省虽地势高寒，但有秋后造林习惯，其效果也比春季造林好。林业专家任承统曾介绍过绥远黄河沿岸群众多年播种杨柳条的方法，即于冬初结冻前，将杨柳细条，截成五、六寸长，在湿润的滩地用犁耠成沟，再把小杨柳条播于沟内，随即复土二、三指厚，明春便一簇一簇的长出来，省苗省工，并且简单易行。也是营造母树林的好方法，各地均可适用。
    （二）长得旺：秋后树苗和枝条的养分充足，栽苗、压条、插枝，发芽生根都有力量。因为先扎根后发芽，本固枝荣；又加病菌害虫因气候较冷，不会侵入树秧的伤口；秋后的一切苗木，在落叶后，蓄积养分充足，到了奏天发芽生长就比较早而旺盛，更不怕春旱。
    （三）树秧树籽都好找：秋后修整树木的很多，砍下来的杨柳枝条正是很好的树秧，尤其每年到处孳生着许多树苗和果苗，秋后正好利用这些野生苗木来造林。这时树木生长停顿，远运调剂也方便。另外，绝大多数的树籽都在秋后成熟，采集容易，各种果核也好找。播种造林或育苗，经一冬软化后，春季发芽也很正常并且还整齐健壮。
    （四）果核、树籽的播种都容易成活：如桃、杏、核桃、山楂等大粒硬谷种籽，因外皮坚硬，或含腊质，水分不易透入，最好在秋后种上过冬，树籽在土中一冻一化，硬谷上挤出了很细的裂缝，才能吸收水分，第二年很早就发芽。所以，用硬谷种籽养苗或荒山播种造林，最好都在秋后进行。特别是橡、栎两树种，在有土的山地上造林，宜于早秋播种，当年就能生根，明春出土。例如：去年河北省东陵造林局的秋播橡籽，发芽成活都在百分之九十以上。它是将来华北、西北造林上的主要树种，但是到了秋天即应随采随播，不要储藏过久或立春再播。
    （五）利用农闲时期：从霜降到小雪的一个多月，正是农闲时期，不像春天那样一天比一天忙，更较雨季造林容易掌握时间。因此，可以充分利用这个时期来调剂树苗和大量造林。在秋季如能很好地发动群众植树，成绩能够超过春、雨两季。据去年河北省的不完全统计，全年植树八八、九五三、二八三株，而秋季就栽了五五、○○○、○○○株。
    二、技术上应注意的几个问题
    （一）干沙地栽树，秋后压条，挖出的土要堆到坑的北面，枝条放到坑里（坑深二尺）并紧靠坑的北边，千万不要栽在穴的当中。这个方法也是造林模范贾兰虎在实际经验中得来的；因为干沙荒中原来水分就少，经过挖坑，势必使沙中水分更加减少。但是把树秧紧靠北边栽，因有一面沙土未动，保有水分较多，易于成活。把树秧栽在坑的中间，则不易成活。此外，还可借以挡住春冬季的风沙吹打，保持适宜的阳光，易于扎根。埋土时要从坑的南面砸土填坑，然后留下一小池子，便于积水存雪；又能阻留刮来的细沙或烂草叶，使变为天然的肥料。杨柳压条，每坑大条要放两根，小条放四根，不宜将一大把条子挤在一起压下去。太长的条子要砍作两段，细头压条，粗头用栽橛子办法去做，又省秧又好活（栽橛子或带根的苗木，封上沙堆后第二年可以不管）。另外最重要的，是必须掌握“深埋、实砸、少露、密栽”的四个诀窍。
    （二）一年生的洋槐等怕冻的树苗，最好在落叶后把树苗刨下来藏在窖内或埋入土中，俟来春发芽时，再刨出来栽植，以后过冬就不再受冻害了。如秋后栽，要切干封土堆。
    （三）秋后造防风林带或林网，先将定植地表的干土铲去，然后挖坑，将土一律放在犯风的一边（西边或北边），树放秧入坑中，再用坑周围的湿土填上踩实。这样，就能使犯风的一边成了一堵墙，既能存住冬雪又能阻挡风沙。
    总之，秋季是一年三季造林中最重要的一季，我们应该大力提倡。在已有习惯的地区，必须发动广大群众行动起来，在现有基础上提高一步，使造林数量与质量不断扩大与改进。而没有习惯的地区，也要开始先搞重点示范，逐渐开展，让我们的造林工作得以迅速推进。
