Hunan Water Conservancy Bureau
Summarizes Flood Control Work and Deploys Winter Repair Tasks
This Year's Victory in Flood Control Guaranteed a Provincial Harvest

[This newspaper dispatch] The Hunan Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau summarized the province's flood control work in late September and deployed winter repair tasks. During the major floods this year, only 49 of the 770 polders in Dongting Lake breached. Of the 5,779,000+ mu of polder land, only 216,000+ mu were flooded, ensuring the safety of 5,563,000+ mu of farmland, accounting for 96.2% of all polder land. This exceeds the central government's assigned task of guaranteeing 85%. Compared to last year's 441 breached polders and 1,742,165 mu of flooded land, this year's flood control achievement is significant. This played a decisive role in this year's provincial harvest.

The reasons for the breaching of 49 polders this year: 14 polders breached due to substandard dike construction and thin dike bodies; 4 polders breached due to bank collapse; 4 polders failed due to mismanagement of sluice gates; 7 polders suffered due to excessively long dike lines and inadequate rescue and protection efforts. As for the 20 polders in the Feng River basin, they were flooded because this year's water level exceeded last year's highest water level by 0.48 meters, making rescue impossible. Judging from the above reasons, this year's high water level in the Feng River is one of the reasons for the breaches, but the main reasons are still insufficient subjective effort, careless dike construction, poor quality, and the complacency and panic of some cadres during the flood season. The Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau has conducted a profound review of this experience and lesson.

The Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau has also clearly stipulated that the repair of breached polders this winter must ensure that no polder breaches and no sluice gate fails under the same water level conditions as last year's flood season. In terms of draining floodwaters, efforts must be made to drain the accumulated water from 200,000 mu of low-lying land. In terms of slope protection, 3 million square meters of turf, stone, or stabilized soil slope protection projects must be completed this winter. There are also specific arrangements for other tasks such as clearing river channels and excavating waterways. As for drought prevention, it is specifically stipulated that the province must complete 100,000 flat-bottomed ponds, 40,000 mountain ponds, and 5,000 small dams this year, with an irrigation area of 3 million mu. In addition, medium-sized irrigation projects will be launched in Doushan in Changde, Erdu River in Xupu, Linghu Lake in Hengyang, and Huanglong Dam in Linwu. Efforts should be made to complete the preparatory work for various winter projects in October, commence construction universally in November, and complete all projects before March of next year, and they should be carried out in conjunction with land reform.

### 湖南水利局  总结防汛工作布置冬修任务  今年胜利完成防汛任务保证了全省丰收

　　湖南水利局
    总结防汛工作布置冬修任务
    今年胜利完成防汛任务保证了全省丰收
    【本报讯】湖南省水利局已于九月下旬总结今年全省防汛工作，布置冬修任务。该省今年大汛期间，洞庭湖七百七十垸中，仅有四十九垸溃决，垸田五百七十七万九千余亩中，被淹者仅有二十一万六千余亩。保障了五百五十六万三千余亩农田的安全，占全部垸田的百分之九十六点二，超过今年中央布置保证百分之八十五的任务。与去年溃决的四百四十一垸，被淹田地一百七十四万二千一百六十五亩相较，今年防汛成绩是很大的。这对今年全省获得丰收，起了决定性的作用。
    今年四十九垸溃决的原因：修堤工程不够标准，堤身单薄而溃决的计十四垸；堤岸崩坐致生溃决的四垸；剅口失事走水的四垸；堤线过长，抢救防护不力的七垸；至沣水流域的二十垸，则由于今年水位已超过去年最高水位○·四八公尺，以致漫溢堤顶，无法抢救。从上面的原因看来，今年沣水高涨是溃决的原因之一，而主要原因仍是主观努力不够，修堤工作草率，质量太差，和防汛期中部分干部的麻痹和慌张。对这一经验教训，该省水利局已作深刻检讨。
    该省水利局并明确规定了今冬修复溃垸，要保证明年汛期与去年水位相等的情况下，不溃一垸，不决一口。对排除溃水方面，要保证排除二十万亩低地的渍水；护坡方面，今冬要完成三百万平方公尺的草皮、石块或三合土的护坡工程。其他关于整理河槽，开挖航道等，也都有具体的布置。至于防旱方面，更具体规定了本年全省要完成平塘十万口，山塘四万口，小型坝五千座，灌溉面积要达到三百万亩，另于常德陡山、溆浦二都河、衡阳酃湖、临武皇龙坝四处，举办中型灌溉工程。各项冬工争取在十月内完成准备工作，十一月起普遍开工，明年三月以前全部完工，并应与土改结合进行。
