　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 6th, dispatch from Electronegative Press correspondent in Hong Kong: The Philippine government is now recruiting criminals from Manila and other cities, as well as Kuomintang "refugees" who have fled to the Philippines, to serve as spies, secret agents, and informers. This measure was recommended by U.S. military officials, who believe the situation in the country is very serious because the Philippine People's Liberation Army now controls vast areas, including areas near Manila.

　　These recruited spies, under the guise of "refugees placed by the police," will be sent to rural areas to gather information about the national liberation movement and report to the Americans and Quirino's police. At the same time, the American authorities in Manila are providing large sums of money (generally believed to be allocated from MacArthur's headquarters in Japan) to carry out pro-American propaganda in Asian countries. This propaganda will be issued under the names of various Philippine organizations, many of which either do not exist at all or have very few members, such as the "National Family Industries Association" and the "Women's Club Federation." American and Kuomintang spies, secret agents, and propaganda "experts" have now arrived in the Philippines to assist in this activity.

　　美国搜罗流氓罪犯在菲加强特务活动
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社布拉格六日消息引电通社驻香港记者报道：菲律宾政府现在招募马尼拉和其他城市的罪犯和逃亡在菲律宾的国民党“难民”充当间谍、特务和奸细。这种措施是美国军事官员们建议的。这些官员们认为这个国家的情况甚为严重，因为菲律宾人民解放军现在已控制了广大地区，包括马尼拉附近的地区。
    这些招募来的间谍，将在“警察局安插的难民”的伪装下，被派到乡村去，收集有关民族解放运动的情报，报告美国人和季里诺的警察。同时，在马尼拉的美国当局正供给大批款项（一般相信是从麦克阿瑟在日本的总部那里拨来的），以便在亚洲各国进行亲美宣传。这些宣传品将假借菲律宾各种组织的名义发出。这些组织中有许多是根本就不存在，或者会员很少，例如“全国家庭工业协会”和“妇女俱乐部联合会”等。美国和国民党的间谍暗深和宣传方面的“专家们”，现已抵达菲律宾，协助该项活动。
