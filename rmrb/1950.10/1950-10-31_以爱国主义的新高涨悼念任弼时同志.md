　　Mourning Comrade Ren Bishi with a New Upsurge of Patriotism
　　Xiao Hua
　　Comrade Ren Bishi, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee, and honorary chairman of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, has unfortunately passed away. The Chinese people's revolutionary cause and people's construction cause have lost a major leader. Recalling the great spirit and strength he devoted to guiding the people's cause forward, there is an uncontrollable feeling of grief at his passing.

　　Comrade Ren Bishi was a great people's fighter and people's statesman. At several decisive junctures in the Chinese people's revolutionary cause, such as opposing Chen Duxiu's betrayal of the revolution and opposing Zhang Guotao's betrayal of the revolution, he resolutely struggled against opportunism with clear political principles. Under the banner of Mao Zedong, he worked with his comrades to guide the people's revolutionary cause to continue moving forward and towards victory.

　　Comrade Ren Bishi was also one of the most outstanding leaders of Chinese youth. He joined the Chinese Socialist Youth League at the age of sixteen and participated in the leadership work of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League from the age of twenty, and was elected Secretary of the Central Committee of the Youth League in 1927. He always cared about the Chinese youth movement and guided our youth to develop in the right direction, striving to enable us to play a huge role in the people's revolutionary cause and the people's construction cause. Today, as our youth mourn their mentor, we should take him as an example for our own learning, forever inherit his spiritual instructions, and actively contribute our strength to new struggle tasks.

　　Comrade Ren Bishi also devoted infinitely valuable spirit and strength to the victorious development of the people's army. During the land revolutionary war, during the period of fierce struggle with the enemy, he went to the army to take on the responsibility of political leadership; during the War of Resistance Against Japan, he also served as the Director of the General Political Department of the Eighth Route Army and went to the front to lead operations. He has always been an outstanding guide in the political work of the people's army.

　　Today, the ferocious and despicable enemy, American imperialism, is expanding armed aggression, and we must continue to wage resolute and heroic struggles for the consolidation and development of our people's motherland. The passing of Comrade Ren Bishi, the great people's fighter and guide, is too early! To compensate for this loss, the comrades of the heroic People's Liberation Army and all the comrades of the Youth League should launch a new upsurge of patriotism. They should cherish infinite loyalty to the cause of the people's motherland and infinite hatred for the enemy, resolutely oppose the deliberate infringement of American imperialism and its running dogs on China's territory, sovereignty, and the lives and property of the people, and be ready at all times to strike at the aggressors in order to consolidate our national defense.

　　The cause and spirit of Comrade Ren Bishi will last forever!

　　以爱国主义的新高涨悼念任弼时同志
    萧华
    中国共产党中央政治局委员、中央书记处书记、中国新民主主义青年团的名誉主席任弼时同志，不幸病逝了。中国人民革命事业和人民建设事业丧失了一位主要的领导者。回想他在引导人民事业向前发展时所付予的伟大精神和力量，对于他的逝世，感到有不能抑止的悲痛。
    任弼时同志是伟大的人民战士和人民政治家，在中国人民革命事业多次的决定关头，例如反对陈独秀叛卖革命、反对张国焘叛卖革命，他都曾以明确的政治原则坚决与机会主义作斗争，在毛泽东旗帜下，和同志们一起，引导人民革命事业继续前进，走向胜利。
    任弼时同志，又是中国青年最杰出的领导者之一。他自十六岁加入中国社会主义青年团，自二十岁起参加中国共产主义青年团中央的领导工作，至一九二七年当选为青年团中央书记。他一向关怀中国青年运动，并引导我们青年本着正确的方向向前发展，努力使我们在人民革命事业和人民建设事业中发挥巨大的作用。今天我们青年悼念自己的导师，更应该以他为自己学习的榜样，永远继承他的精神指示，积极贡献我们的力量于新的斗争任务之中。
    任弼时同志，对于人民军队的胜利发展，也曾付出了无限可贵的精神和力量。他在土地革命战争中，在同敌人作残酷斗争的时期，到军队中担负政治领导的责任；在抗日战争中，并曾担任八路军的总政治部主任，到前线领导作战。他一直是人民军队政治工作的一位卓越的指导者。
    今天凶恶卑鄙的敌人美国帝国主义正在扩张武装侵略，我们为人民祖国的巩固发展，还须继续作坚决英勇的斗争。人民的伟大战士和指导者任弼时同志的逝世是太早了！为补偿这个损失，英勇的人民解放军的同志们，全体青年团的同志们，应该掀起爱国主义的新高潮，应该怀着对人民祖国事业的无限忠诚，对敌人的无限仇恨，坚决反对美国帝国主义及其走狗对中国领土、主权和人民生命财产的蓄意侵犯，随时准备打击侵略者，以巩固我们的国防。
    任弼时同志的事业和精神永垂不朽！
