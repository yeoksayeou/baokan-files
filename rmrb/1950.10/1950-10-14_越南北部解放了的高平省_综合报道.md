　　The Liberated Cao Bằng Province in Northern Vietnam
    Comprehensive Report
    Cao Bằng, located in the northern part of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, is a province bordering our country, 270 kilometers from Hanoi. Cao Bằng is a mountainous region, with the Kỳ Cùng River running through it, but it is not suitable for navigation. The No. 3 highway, which starts from Cao Bằng and passes through Bắc Kạn and Thái Nguyên to Hanoi, is currently controlled by the Vietnamese People's Army. The No. 4 highway runs through Đông Khê, Thất Khê, and Na Sầm to Lạng Sơn. The railway from Lạng Sơn to Hanoi has been destroyed by the Vietnamese People's Army, and French troops cannot pass through this section and are surrounded in several small strongholds.

    The total population of Cao Bằng province is 200,000, most of whom are ethnic minorities, such as the Tày, the Dao, and the Nùng. Cao Bằng is a province with a rich revolutionary tradition. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was one of the three provinces (Lạng Sơn, Cao Bằng, and Bắc Kạn) where the Việt Minh initially established liberated areas.

    In the autumn of 1947, the French army concentrated more than 20,000 elite troops from the sea, land, and air to attack Việt Bắc from Hanoi, attempting to eliminate the main force of the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army and the leading organs of the Vietnamese government, as they believed that the main force of the Việt Minh and the leading organs of the Vietnamese government were concentrated there. At the beginning of the offensive, the French troops occupied Bắc Kạn city (October 7, 1947) and Cao Bằng city (August 18, 1947) with paratrooper forces, but under the heroic counterattack of the Vietnamese army and people, about 10,000 attacking French troops were annihilated and retreated. However, because Bắc Kạn and Cao Bằng were two important military bases, the French troops desperately invaded again and occupied these two cities, attempting to blockade the Vietnamese border and control important transportation lines—mainly Highways 3 and 4.

    After the Việt Bắc campaign in 1947, the balance of power between the Vietnamese and French sides had changed. The strength of the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army grew stronger day by day, while the strength of the French army gradually weakened. At this time, the Vietnamese Liberation War gradually shifted from the defensive stage to a stalemate stage. In this stage, the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army often attacked the French military transport coming and going on Highways 3 and 4, causing great obstacles to the enemy not only in transportation but also serious difficulties in the connection between enemy strongholds in Bắc Kạn, Cao Bằng, Đông Khê, and Thất Khê.

    On August 7, 1949, the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army repelled the French troops stationed in Bắc Kạn, making Cao Bằng even more isolated. The small French strongholds around Cao Bằng were also removed one by one. The Vietnamese People's Liberation Army then controlled Highway 4, which connects Cao Bằng to Lạng Sơn. Every time the French army risked sending troops and weapons from Lạng Sơn to Cao Bằng, they suffered heavy losses. For example, on March 15, 1949, twenty French military transport vehicles were destroyed; on April 25, 1949, ninety-seven French military transport vehicles were destroyed on this road. Therefore, the French army called this road the "Road of Blood." The remaining French strongholds on this road were constantly being eliminated. Đông Khê was an outpost stronghold of Cao Bằng, which was captured by the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army on May 25, 1950. Later, it was occupied by French paratrooper forces. On September 18 this year, the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army liberated Đông Khê again, and Đông Khê is now completely under the control of the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army.

    After Đông Khê was captured by the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army, the French military connection between Cao Bằng and Lạng Sơn was completely cut off. At the beginning of this year, the French colonialists had seen the crisis they faced in Cao Bằng, but because Cao Bằng was an important strategic stronghold related to their life and death, they desperately defended it. The French colonialists sent their most elite troops to reinforce Cao Bằng and build fortifications. But these did not save them from their doomed defeat. Under the heavy blows of the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army, the French colonial troops fled Cao Bằng in a panic and were finally annihilated. The French troops who came to reinforce from Lạng Sơn were also mostly annihilated. This was the biggest defeat the French colonial troops had ever suffered in the war of aggression against Vietnam. The French colonial authorities had to admit sadly: With the loss of Cao Bằng, there is no longer a French military stronghold in the more than 200-mile-long Vietnamese border area.

　　越南北部解放了的高平省
    综合报道
    高平，在越南民主共和国北部，是与我国接界的一个省份。距河内二百七十公里。高平是一个高山峻岭的地区，省内有其贡河，可是不适于航行。以高平为起点有一条经北?、太原通往河内的公路，叫第三号公路，目前为越南解放军所控制；另一条是经东溪，七溪及那岑而通往谅山的公路，叫第四号公路。自谅山往河内的铁路已被越南解放军破击，法军在这段路上已不能通行且被包围在几个小据点内。
    高平全省人口有二十万，大部分是少数民族，如土族，曼族，族（译音）等。高平是一个富有革命传统的省份。在抗日战争时期，是越盟最初建立起解放区的三个省份中（谅山，高平，北?）的一个。
    一九四七年秋季，法军集中了二万多海陆空精锐部队，从河内向越北进攻，企图消灭越南人民解放军主力部队和越南政府的领导机关。因为他们认为越军主力及越南政府的领导机关都集中在这里。进攻开始时，法军以降落伞部队占领了北?市（一九四七年十月七日）及高平市（一九四七年十八月日），但在越南军民英勇反击下，进攻的法军被消灭了一万左右，并向后撤退。但因北?及高平是两个重要军事基地，所以法军又拼死入侵，占据了这两个城市，企图封锁越南的边境及控制重要的交通线——主要是第三和第四号公路。
    一九四七年越北战役之后，越法双方力量的对比已有了改变。越南人民解放军的力量一日一日强大，而法军力量则日渐衰弱下去。这时候，越南解放战争就从防御阶段逐渐转变为相持阶段。在这个阶段中，越南解放军常常在第三、第四号公路上攻击来往的法军运输军，使敌人不仅在交通方面受到了大大的障碍，北?、高平、东溪、七溪等敌人据点的联络也同样地遭受到严重的困难。
    一九四九年八月七日，越南解放军击退了驻在北?的法军，使高平更陷于孤立。高平周围的法军小据点，也被一一拔除。越南解放军遂控制了高平通往谅山的第四号公路。每次法军从谅山冒险地把军队和武器送往高平时，都遭受重大损失。例如，一九四九年三月十五日，有二十辆法军运输车被击毁；一九四九年四月二十五日，有九十七辆法军运输车在这条路上被击毁。因此，法军把这条路叫做“血路”。在这条路上残存的法军据点不断地遭到拔除的命运。东溪是高平的一个前哨据点，一九五○年五月二十五日为越南解放军攻克。后又为法降落伞部队攻占。今年九月十八日，越解放军再度解放东溪，东溪已完全为越南解放军所掌握了。
    东溪被越南解放军攻克后，高平与谅山间的法军联络完全被切断了。今年初，法殖民者已看出他们在高平的危机，但因高平是有关他们生死的一个重要战略据点。所以他们拚死据守，法殖民者派最精锐部队增援高平，建立防御工事。但是这些并没有挽回他们的已注定的失败命运。在越南人民解放军的重大打击下，法殖民军队狼狈撤出高平，而最后终被歼灭。从谅山北上增援的法军也大部被歼灭。这是在侵略越南战争中，法殖民军队从未遭受过的大失败。法殖民当局不得不悲哀地承认：高平失守，长二百多英里的越南边陲地区，已不复再有一个法军的据点了。
