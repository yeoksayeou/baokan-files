Xinhua News Agency, October 25th dispatch from New York: TASS, New York, October 25th—The Women's Peace Committee of Chelsea, New York, wrote to the Soviet Union's representative to the United Nations, Malik, expressing the feelings and hopes of ordinary American people for peace and requesting Malik to meet with a delegation from the committee.

The United States representative to the United Nations, Austin, the Indian representative, Rau, the President of the General Assembly, Entezam, and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Trygve Lie, were also asked to meet with the committee's delegation.

The Women's Peace Committee hoped to get answers to three questions:

1. Is a peaceful resolution of the Korean War possible now?

2. How has the refusal to allow representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the United Nations affected the Security Council's ability to promote world peace in the past and present?

3. Do you think it is possible to reach an agreement on the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction at present?

On October 21st, Malik met with the representatives of the Women's Peace Committee.

The head of the delegation, Miller, stated: Several weeks ago, the Peace Committee consulted residents in its area regarding a statement signed by 462 prominent pastors representing various denominations, calling for a peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict and allowing the People's Republic of China to participate in the United Nations. As a result, 399 out of 437 adults surveyed by the committee, or 92 percent, expressed support for the peaceful mediation of the Korean conflict and avoiding new wars. The representatives said: The women in the area who they spoke with do not want a new war and are eagerly longing for peace.

Malik replied: Countries fighting for peace will win this battle. Women must play a great role in the struggle. Malik stated that the role of women around the world must be increased in the struggle for peace.

Regarding the first question, Malik said that the Soviet delegation attending the United Nations General Assembly had submitted to the General Assembly for consideration the only just proposal that is in line with the interests of the Korean people and the consolidation of peace, thereby putting forward a fair method for resolving the Korean question. If the United Nations General Assembly passes the Soviet proposal, it can guarantee a fair resolution of the Korean question and guarantee the establishment of an independent and unified Korean state. This is easy to understand.

When discussing the second question, Malik pointed out that everyone understands that only governments that exercise real power within member states of the United Nations can send representatives to the United Nations. Therefore, only the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has the right to represent China and its 475 million people who have won freedom and independence through a long and arduous struggle in the United Nations. The absence of a legitimate representative of the government of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, and the usurpation of China's seat in the United Nations by the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionary clique, seriously hinders the resolution of important international issues and the strengthening of the cause of peace.

One representative asked: Can the "United Action for Peace" proposal jointly put forward by representatives from Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and other countries help strengthen the United Nations as an instrument of peace? Malik explained the significance and purpose of this proposal, which strikes at the principle of unanimity among the great powers in the Security Council—the foundation of the United Nations. He pointed out: This proposal crudely violates the Charter and stipulates the establishment of armed forces commanded by the United Nations General Assembly, rather than by the Security Council as stipulated in the United Nations Charter. The Security Council must act in accordance with the principle of unanimity among the permanent members of the Security Council—the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and China. The experience of the United Nations passing resolutions that violate the Charter shows that they undermine the prestige of the United Nations and cannot contribute to the cause of strengthening peace.

In answering the third question, Malik pointed out that the Soviet Union has always supported and still supports disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

Malik said: The Soviet delegation has submitted the "Declaration on Averting the Threat of a New War, Consolidating World Peace and Security" for the General Assembly's consideration. This declaration vividly demonstrates the desire of the Soviet government and the Soviet people to avert the threat of a new war and ensure peace throughout the world.

Malik recalled that as early as 1947, the Soviet government had requested the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission to consider a proposal to establish an international committee to impose strict international control over the production of atomic energy and supervise enterprises producing atomic energy. As is well known, the Soviet proposal stipulated the establishment of an international committee to implement strict international control over atomic energy enterprises, and these proposals clearly stipulated the rights and functions of this committee. The representative of the United States to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission also put forward a proposal called the "Baruch Plan." This proposal was unacceptable because it stipulated the establishment of an international atomic trust actually controlled by American monopolies. According to this plan, this international trust would in reality be the master and owner of all atomic energy enterprises in the world, which sovereign states cannot allow and cannot accept.

The representatives asked Malik: Do the Soviet people want peace?

Malik replied: No other people in the world have undergone the kind of trials that the Soviet people experienced in the Second World War. The Soviet people waged a self-sacrificing struggle against fascist troops for freedom, independence, and international peace. Malik pointed out that the Soviet people unanimously responded to the Stockholm Appeal, with more than 115 million people signing the declaration. This fact is a powerful testament to their desire to strengthen peace. The Soviet people do not want war and are engaged in peaceful, constructive labor.

Malik recounted his previous conversation with a delegation from the Maryland Peace Committee in the United States. He pointed out that he had given affirmative answers to all four questions from the delegation. During the conversation, it became known that the aforementioned Maryland delegation, which visited Malik on September 25th, had also said they would visit the United States representative to the United Nations, Austin. However, to date, this has not happened because the American representative refused to meet with the delegation.

The conversation took place in a warm and friendly atmosphere. At the end of the conversation, the delegation expressed their gratitude to Malik for his warm hospitality.

　　关于和平问题
    马立克答复美国妇女
    联大通过苏联提案就能够和平解决朝鲜问题
    联合国没有中国合法代表严重妨碍国际和平
    苏联政府和人民始终拥护裁军禁用原子武器
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社纽约二十五日讯：纽约契尔西亚区妇女和平委员会曾致函苏联驻联合国代表马立克，表示美国普通人民对和平的情绪及希望，并请求马立克接见该委员会代表团。
    联合国美国代表奥斯汀、印度代表劳氏、联大主席安迪让及联合国秘书长赖伊等也被要求接见该委员会的代表团。
    妇女和平委员会希望答复三个问题：
    一、朝鲜战争现在可能和平解决吗？
    二、不准许中华人民共和国代表参加联合国一事，在过去和现在怎样影响了安全理事会促进世界和平事业的能力？
    三、您以为目前在裁减军备与禁止大规模毁灭性武器上可能获致协议吗？
    十月二十一日，马立克接见妇女和平委员会代表。
    代表团团长米勒称：数星期前，该和平委员会曾根据代表各种教派的著名牧师四百六十二人为要求和平解决朝鲜冲突并允许中华人民共和国参加联合国而签署的声明，征询该委员会所在区域居民的意见。结果该委员会所询问的成年人四百三十七人中有三百九十九人即百分之九十二都表示赞成朝鲜冲突的和平调处并赞成避免新战争。代表们说：该区和她们谈过话的妇女都不要新战争并且热烈渴望和平。
    马立克答复说：为和平而战的国家将会打赢这一仗的，妇女必须在斗争中起伟大的作用。马立克表示：必需增大全世界妇女在争取和平的斗争中的作用。
    关于第一个问题，马立克说，出席联合国大会的苏联代表团曾提请联合国大会审议与朝鲜人民的利益及稳固和平相符合的唯一公正的提案，从而提出了公平解决朝鲜问题的方法。联合国大会如果通过苏联提案，就可保证公平解决朝鲜问题，并保证建立独立统一的朝鲜国家，这是很容易了解的。
    在谈到第二个问题时，马立克指出，每个人都了解，只有在联合国组织成员国国内行使真正权力的政府，才能派代表出席联合国，所以，只有中华人民共和国中央人民政府，才有权利在联合国内代表中国和它的在长期艰苦斗争中获得自由与独立的四亿七千五百万人民。联合国中没有中华人民共和国政府的合法代表，联合国组织中中国的席位为国民党反动集团的残余分子所篡夺，这件事严重地妨碍了重要国际问题的解决与和平事业的加强。
    一位代表问：加拿大、英国、美国、法国及其他国家代表联合提出的“保障和平的联合行动”案是否能有助于加强作为和平工具的联合国？马立克解释了这项打击安理会中大国一致原则——联合国组织的基础——的提案的意义和目的。他指出：这项提案粗暴地违犯了宪章，规定建立由联合国大会指挥，而不是按照联合国宪章的规定由安理会指挥的武装部队。安理会必须根据安理会常任理事国——苏、美、英、法、中——一致的原则行事。联合国通过了违反宪章的提案，这个经验表明：它们破坏联合国的威信而且不能对加强和平的事业有所裨益。
    马立克在回答第三个问题时指出：苏联始终拥护而且仍然拥护裁减军备及禁止原子武器。
    马立克说：苏联代表团提出了“制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全的宣言”案，请大会审议。这一宣言生动地表明了苏联政府与苏联人民制止新战争威胁及保证全世界和平的愿望。
    马立克回忆道：早在一九四七年，苏联政府即曾提请联合国原子能委员会考虑一项建议，建立一个国际委员会以对原子能的生产施以严格的国际管制，并监督生产原子能的企业。如所周知，苏联的建议规定设立国际委员会以对原子能企业实施严格的国际管制，这些建议明确地规定了这个委员会的权利与职能。美国驻联合国原子能委员会的代表也提出了名为“巴鲁区计划”的建议。这个建议是不能接受的，因为它规定建立一个实际上是由美国垄断企业掌握的国际原子托辣斯。按照这个计划，此种国际托辣斯实际上将是全世界一切原子企业的主人及所有者，这是主权国家所不能允许和不能接受的。
    代表们问马立克：苏联人民是否要和平？
    马立克答复道：世界上没有那一国人民受过苏联人民在二次世界大战中所经历过的那种考验。苏联人民为自由、独立及国际间的和平，对法西斯军队进行了自我牺牲的斗争。马立克指出，苏联人民一致响应斯德哥尔摩宣言，有一亿一千五百余万人在宣言上签名。这一事实，是他们希望加强和平的一个有力证明。苏联人民不要战争，并且正在从事和平的建设性的劳动。
    马立克追述他前此与美国马利兰州和平委员会代表团的谈话。他指出，他对该代表团的所有四个问题全给予肯定的答复。在谈话过程中，大家都知道了：九月二十五日访问马立克的上述马利兰州代表团曾说过也要访问美国驻联合国代表奥斯汀。但迄今为止，此事并未发生，因为美国代表拒绝接见该代表团。
    谈话在热烈及友好气氛中进行。在谈话结束时，代表团对马立克的热诚招待表示感谢。
