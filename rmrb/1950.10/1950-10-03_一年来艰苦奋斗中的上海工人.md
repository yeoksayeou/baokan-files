(1) Profoundly understood Chairman Mao's famous saying through arduous struggle

October 1, 1949, marked the founding of the great People's Republic of China.

The workers of Shanghai, having gained their liberation only five months prior, greeted this unprecedentedly great festival of the motherland's rebirth with the utmost enthusiasm. The Shanghai workers, oppressed and exploited for decades by imperialism and its running dog, the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique, also demonstrated an unprecedented power to celebrate this epoch-making victory.

Recalling last year, from October 1st onwards, Shanghai workers launched enthusiastic celebrations inside and outside the factories. During their spare time, endless streams of worker teams emerged on the streets for more than ten consecutive days. While celebrating their own day of liberation, they did not forget to protect the fruits of this victory. Shanghai workers responded to the call of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, taking practical actions to overcome difficulties and build the nation. They also responded to the call of the China Peace Congress, issuing warnings with great force to the imperialist warmongers. On October 8th, seven hundred thousand Shanghai workers, together with people from all walks of life in the city, converged from five routes—Hudong, Hubei, Huxi, Hunan, and Huzhong—plus those arriving from Pudong across the river, at the racecourse to receive the review of Party and government leaders. From 8:00 AM until 4:00 AM the next morning, the surging ranks, carrying various machine models created by the masses, peace doves, peace goddesses, globes, lighthouses, airplane models, and cannon models, showcased various dances, dragon lanterns, and folk arts. This great iron contingent, like a giant torch, lit up the entire Shanghai, becoming an unprecedented feat in Shanghai's history.

A year has passed. The anniversary of the National Day is here again. Shanghai workers have deeply understood Chairman Mao's famous saying, "There are difficulties, there are solutions, there is hope." Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, they have undertaken the arduous tasks of overcoming difficulties and maintaining production. The Shanghai Municipal Workers' Congress, which began on February 1st this year, passed various resolutions centered around the basic principles of "concentrating strength, maintaining production, smashing the blockade, and overcoming difficulties," and elected and established its leading body—the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions. Shanghai workers opposed the enemy's armed blockade and bombing, enthusiastically supported the front lines, and actively defended peace. They vigorously launched work to provide relief to unemployed brothers. They adopted labor-capital consultation methods, united the national bourgeoisie, and together with people from all walks of life, used various methods to overcome the most difficult months of March and April. Afterwards, they continued to overcome difficulties, organized production competitions, and selected labor models to welcome this year's National Day anniversary.

(2) Shanghai Workers in the Face of Business Difficulties and the Anti-Bombing Struggle

Shanghai was a base where imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism long exploited the Chinese people. All their past regimes and measures were used to oppress and exploit workers and the broad masses of the people to satisfy their insatiable desires. Therefore, Shanghai faced many transitional difficulties upon liberation. On the one hand, American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandits blockaded our ports and bombed our peaceful cities, increasing our difficulties. On the other hand, many enterprises in Shanghai relied on imperialism for survival in the past, and many enterprises served the extravagant lives of feudal bureaucratic capitalists. Transforming them to suit the needs of the people is not something that can be done overnight. Under such circumstances, Shanghai workers have particularly emphasized "overcoming difficulties" since liberation and passed specific resolutions centered around this at the Shanghai Municipal Workers' Congress. On the eve of the congress's closing, February 6th, American-Chiang bandit planes extensively bombed Shanghai's power plants, attempting to plunge Shanghai into a state of unproductivity, to leave workers without work, and to make life impossible for the people of Shanghai. However, the workers of Shanghai and people from all walks of life were not intimidated by them. When the bandit planes damaged the power plants, workers, under the leadership of the Party and government, organized pickets and repair teams, actively engaging in the anti-bombing struggle, cooperating with public security departments in air defense and security work. The Shanghai Electric Power Company power plant, the largest in Shanghai and most severely damaged, carried out clearing and repair work under the leadership of the trade union. During this process, workers demonstrated a high degree of selflessness, regardless of continuous rain and enemy plane harassment, working day and night on repairs. From being bombed to restoring power generation, it only took forty-two hours and five minutes to restore light to the entire city. In this way, they used action to denounce the criminal acts of imperialism and avenge the fallen comrades. During the repair process, worker brothers and sisters from other enterprises, the People's Liberation Army, and university and middle school students came to offer their condolences and work together with the Shanghai Electric Power workers on repairs, demonstrating great class solidarity and boundless care and sympathy.

On the production front, Shanghai workers have implemented Chairman Mao's policy of "both public and private interests, benefit to both labor and capital, developing production, and promoting economic prosperity." In the months following the "February 6th" bombing, Shanghai's entire industry and commerce fell into its most difficult state. Damage to the power plants greatly reduced power generation, production came to a sudden halt, and the closure of factories and unemployment by some capitalists led to numerous labor-capital disputes. But the workers did not forget the resolutions passed at the Workers' Congress and demonstrated great concessions in the process of overcoming difficulties. As early as the end of 1949, Shanghai workers demonstrated this spirit on the issue of year-end bonuses. Shanghai workers firmly supported the implementation of the Central People's Government's year-end bonus measures for state-owned enterprises. In private enterprises, in order to take care of the overall situation, they also demonstrated the same spirit. It is estimated that the year-end bonuses for workers in private enterprises throughout the city were generally 30 to 50 percent less than in 1948. After the "February 6th" bombing, in order to maintain production, Shanghai workers voluntarily made even greater concessions to the capitalists in order to maintain production as much as possible. This situation was widespread, fully implementing the basic policy of mutual benefit for labor and capital to overcome the current difficulties together. However, there were also individual capitalists who did not understand the government's policies and irresponsibly abandoned their factories and fled, while the workers tried hard to support them and waited for the capitalists to return. For example, the capitalist of the private Hongfeng Yarn Factory in Shanghai went to Hong Kong on the eve of Shanghai's liberation, and his appointed agent was also irresponsible. Workers were owed five installments of wages, six installments of subsidized rice, and all attendance bonuses, putting the workers' lives in dire straits. At that time, the workers, under the leadership of the trade union, persuaded the capitalist's agent, organized a "Production Maintenance Committee," contacted the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company to negotiate consignment spinning, and started 15,000 spindles spinning, helping the factory to initially improve the corrupt system of the past, eliminating serious theft, and unprecedentedly increasing output, saving a lot of raw materials, electricity, and labor, achieving self-sufficiency at cost, and further surplus. Moreover, in order to supplement working capital and purchase electricity, the workers would rather save their wages, taking only a minimum of 36 actual units per month.

Private factories occupy a large number in Shanghai, and the situation is complicated. To do a good job in production, it is necessary to normalize labor-capital relations and sign collective contracts with the central task of developing production. In this regard, Shanghai workers responded to the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and established labor-capital consultation meetings to achieve this goal. To date, 73 industry-based labor-capital consultation meetings and 427 factory-unit meetings have been established. Currently, there are industry-specific collective contracts that have been signed or are being drafted, including the photography industry, paper industry, camel hair industry, wine and soy sauce industry, tea industry, sock knitting industry, bathing industry, and tricycle industry.

After the "February 6th" bombing, the number of unemployed workers suddenly increased. However, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, Shanghai workers made the greatest efforts to maintain production on the one hand, and on the other hand, with the support of the government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, launched work to provide relief to unemployed brothers. In mid-April, the number of unemployed was estimated to be around 150,000. Shanghai workers, witnessing the suffering of their brothers, immediately reported to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for assistance and mobilized themselves. At the call of Shanghai, Shanghai workers, in the case of already reduced wages, generally donated one day's wage, totaling 9,006,645,694.65 yuan. People and institutions and troops from all walks of life in Shanghai responded and donated 6,797,522,360 yuan. At the same time, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions called on workers across the country to promote class solidarity and asked workers in employment nationwide to donate one day's wages to help unemployed workers, totaling more than 28 billion yuan, most of which was used to help unemployed workers in Shanghai. Due to the decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government, the Shanghai Municipal Unemployed Workers Relief Committee was established (before this, a temporary relief committee had been established) to carry out the work. In this way, unemployed workers generally received emergency relief, providing relief to more than 90,000 unemployed workers and more than 130,000 of their family members. Some unemployed workers were able to return to their hometowns and change careers, while more than 6,000 people were organized for work-for-relief, and more than 18,000 unemployed workers were organized for study classes. This work, with the assistance and promotion of trade unions at all levels, is being carried out universally.

Due to the serious existence of difficulties left by the enemy and added to us, the production task of Shanghai workers is first to overcome difficulties. At the same time, strengthen leadership in production work, further promote it, especially to organize production competitions. Although this is not done enough, there are relatively successful examples such as: State-owned Textile Factory No. 7 established a workshop contact contract, setting off a wave of red flag competitions. The average finished product of the factory in March was 58.66 points, which was the worst factory in Shanghai. Under the efforts to promote the contact contract, in two months, the quality of finished products averaged 82.85 points, winning the first place in Shanghai for finished product quality. For example, after the Shanghai Public Transport Company implemented the responsibility system, it saved a large amount of equipment and fuel, increasing from 7.8 kilometers per gallon of gasoline to 10.3 kilometers. Some individual ones created a maximum record of 14.3 kilometers. Originally, the government needed to subsidize hundreds of thousands of real units per month. Since the implementation of the responsibility system, it has gradually achieved self-sufficiency at cost. Other examples include Textile Factory No. 11, which initially put production on the right track through the establishment of a factory management committee. The private Minghua Pharmacy, under the leadership of the trade union, created a method of launching competitions among store employees to overcome difficulties. Of course, the creativity of the workers is unlimited. In various production tasks, especially in the implementation of factory management democratization, the responsibility system, contact contracts, and labor conventions, a large number of labor models have emerged in production. The first Shanghai Municipal Labor Model Conference, the labor models selected by various factories totaled 2,777, and 673 were formally evaluated by the Municipal Labor Model Evaluation Committee. They passed the Shanghai Municipal Labor Model Conference and put forward their own 15 representatives to participate in the National Congress of Labor, Peasants and Soldiers Labor Models. Among them, Zhang Shibao of Shanghai Electric Power insisted on repairing for 36 hours during the "February 6th" bombing; Pan Ayao, a technician from Shenchang Hardware Manufacturing Factory, spent 200,000 yuan of private savings to invent seamless copper pipes; Zhang Deqing, an engineer from Shanghai Public Transport Company, with the assistance of workers, invented the white coal car, saving a lot of people's property; others are either models of production saving, improving quality, or heroes of supporting the front line, all of which are recognized by the workers. This is a concrete manifestation of the Shanghai working class heroically taking the lead in overcoming difficulties and maintaining production. On this basis, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions called for further improvement in production, organization of production competitions, in order to consolidate and expand the victory on the production front.

According to the resolutions passed at the first Shanghai Municipal Workers' Congress, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions adopted specific deployments to strengthen industry trade unions, and established 1,774 grass-roots trade union organizations with more than 25 people; and 4,299 with less than 25 people. It has dispatched cadres to factories several times to understand the situation and help with the work. Recently, it has specially dispatched cadres to factories to focus on studying ways to improve the grass-roots organizations. In terms of cultural education, in addition to the 106 regular workers' spare-time schools in the city, various study classes and lectures have been held to train some backbones of trade union work. Workers' clubs and cultural palaces have been built in Huxi and Hubei districts, and a labor park has been established in Hudong to strengthen workers' spare-time cultural and recreational activities. Cadres are also frequently dispatched to factories to conduct investigations and research on factory safety and hygiene work, and mobilize the masses to promote the work. For example, Textile Factory No. 17 is a good example. Now the dining hall and toilets have been cleaned, the nurseries have been improved, and equipment has been improved and physical examinations have been carried out through large-scale cleaning competitions, etc., so that workers have increased their enthusiasm for production. Other tasks are also being promoted.

In the past year, Shanghai workers have made every effort to overcome difficulties and do a good job in production, knowing that only in this way can they make the best contribution to the great cause of internationalism in defending world peace. Shanghai workers have repeatedly welcomed the arrival of worker brothers and peace allies from all over the world with full enthusiasm and are proud of it. After celebrating the founding of the Central People's Government, the Soviet cultural, artistic, and scientific workers delegation; worker representatives and women representatives from Asian and Australian countries came to Shanghai in succession. Shanghai workers happily organized welcoming teams to meet them at the station in the middle of the night, held welcoming meetings for ten thousand people, invited them to visit factories, exchange fighting experiences, and strengthen their confidence in defending world peace. Workers are particularly enthusiastic about learning from the Soviet Union's elder brothers in production and construction and trade union work experience. Shanghai workers love peace. Under the call of the Chinese Committee for the Defence of World Peace and under the leadership of its Shanghai branch, 1,599,971 Shanghai workers, including their families, signed to defend world peace. On the August 1st Army Day of the Chinese People's Liberation Army this year, in the movement against US aggression against Taiwan and Korea, 60,000 Shanghai workers joined with 100,000 people from all walks of life, gathering from midnight to hold meetings, and afterwards held parades and demonstrations, taking resolute action to oppose the aggression of US imperialism, showing their determination to defend world peace.

(3) Unite and work hard to strive for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation

Over the past year, under the leadership of trade union organizations, Shanghai workers have basically completed the arduous tasks of overcoming difficulties and maintaining production, and have shown certain achievements in other tasks. However, the entire Shanghai workers' movement still has many shortcomings. After the workers in Shanghai were organized, the Shanghai trade union work was not able to go deeper and consolidate in a timely manner, so that it could turn from the grand movement basis to enriching the content of daily work. The main reason is that the trade union work is not enough in terms of facing production and closely contacting the broad masses of workers. This is manifested in the fact that the organizational work has not cultivated a large number of cadres and activists to consolidate the organization; and there is a tendency towards formalism. In terms of work style, they are not good at protecting the daily interests of the working class, and there are serious phenomena of commandism, paternalism, and detachment from the masses. In terms of labor-capital relations, there are also some inappropriate behaviors. In short, the situation in Shanghai is complicated, and the subjective strength cannot keep up with the rapid development of the situation. In order to do a good job in production and continue to overcome difficulties, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, has put forward the future direction and tasks: concentrate strength, face production, do a good job in production, and organize production competitions; do a good job in providing relief to unemployed workers, so as to facilitate the restoration and development of production. In order to implement the above policy, Shanghai trade union cadres are inspecting and summarizing work, rectifying the trade union organization and the work style of cadres, improving and training cadres, and improving the leadership methods and methods in the work of trade unions at all levels.

The Shanghai working class has undergone a long and arduous struggle under the leadership of its vanguard—the Communist Party of China—for decades before it gained its own liberation. After liberation, it went through various struggles and spent the most difficult year. Under the current circumstances that the country's financial and economic situation has already begun to improve initially; when celebrating the second National Day festival, the Shanghai workers will definitely make persistent efforts, unite and work hard, to realize the task assigned by Chairman Mao: "Strive for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation!"

　　一年来艰苦奋斗中的上海工人
    刘长胜
    （一）从艰苦斗争中深刻体会了毛主席的名言
    一九四九年十月一日，伟大的中华人民共和国成立。
    上海工人在得到自己的解放以后才五个月，以最热烈的心情，来迎接这个历史上空前未有的祖国新生的伟大节日。被帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石反动集团压迫剥削了数十年的上海工人，也第一次表现了空前未有的力量来庆祝这个划时代的胜利节日。
    回忆去年，从十月一日起，上海工人即在工厂内外展开热烈的庆贺。在业余时间，街头上涌现络绛不绝的工人队伍连续十余天之多。在庆祝自己翻身的日子里，没有忘记保护这个胜利的果实，上海工人响应了毛主席和中央人民政府的号召，以实际行动来克服困难，建设国家；也响应了中国保卫世界和平大会的号召，以巨大力量来向帝国主义战争贩子，发出警告。在十月八日那天，上海七十万工人，与全市各界人民在一起从沪东、沪北、沪西、沪南、沪中五路，加上浦东渡江而来的，汇合在跑马厅接受党政首长的检阅。从清晨八时起至第二天早晨四时，洪流似的行列，随带着群众性创造的各种机器模型，和平鸽、和平女神、地球、灯塔、飞机、大炮模型，表现着各种舞、龙灯、民间艺术等。这伟大的铁的队伍，像一个巨大的火炬，烧亮了整个上海，成为上海历史上空前未有的壮举。
    一年过去了。国庆一周年纪念日又到了。上海工人深刻体会毛主席“有困难、有办法、有希望”的名言，在共产党与人民政府的领导下，进行了克服困难、维持生产的各项艰巨任务。今年二月一日开始的上海市工人代表大会通过了以“集中力量、维持生产、粉碎封锁、克服困难”的基本方针为中心的各项决议，选举和成立了自己的领导机关——上海总工会。上海工人反对了敌人的武装封锁与轰炸，热烈支援前线，积极保卫和平；大力开展了救济失业弟兄的工作；采用劳资协商方式，团结了民族资产阶级，并与各界人民一起，用各种办法渡过三、四月间最困难的月份；以后，则以继续克服困难，组织生产竞赛，评选劳动模范来迎接今年的国庆纪念日。
    （二）工商业遭遇困难与反轰炸斗争中的上海工人
    上海是帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义长期剥削中国人民的基地，它们过去的一切政权和措施都是用来压迫和剥削工人及广大人民，以遂他们贪婪无厌的欲望。所以，上海一解放就面临了很多转变中的困难问题。一方面是：美国帝国主义与蒋介石残匪，封锁我们的港口，轰炸我们的和平城市，增加我们的困难。另一方面，上海很多企业，过去都是依赖帝国主义生存的，许多企业又都是为封建官僚资本的奢侈生活所服务的，要改造为适合人民的需要，更不是一朝一夕的事情。上海工人在这样的情况下，在解放以来就特别强调了“克服困难”，并在上海市工人代表大会上通过了以此为中心的各项具体决议。二月六日，大会闭幕的前夜，美蒋匪机大肆轰炸上海的各个电力厂，想使上海陷入无法生产的境地，想使工人没有工做，上海人民不能生活。然而，上海的工人和各界人民，并没被它们吓倒。在匪机破坏各电力厂时，工人在党和政府的领导下，组织了纠察队、抢修队，积极展开反轰炸斗争，配合公安部门的防空治安工作。被破坏最严重也是上海最大的上海电力公司发电厂，在工会的领导之下，进行清理抢修工作。在这中间，工人表现了高度的忘我精神，不管连日霪雨，匪机骚扰，昼夜不息的进行抢修，从被炸到修复发电，仅仅是四十二个钟点零五分，就使全市恢复光明。这样，就用行动来控诉了帝国主义的罪恶行为，替死难的工友复仇。在抢修过程中，其他企业的工人弟兄姊妹、人民解放军、大中学生都赶来慰问，并和上电工人一起进行抢修工作，表现了伟大的阶级友爱与无限的关怀和同情。
    上海工人在生产战线上，是执行了毛主席的“公私兼顾、劳资两利、发展生产、繁荣经济”政策的。在“二、六”轰炸后的几个月中，整个上海的工商业陷于最困难的状态下，电力厂的被破坏，发电量大为减少，生产骤然停顿，加之，发生了若干资本家将工厂关闭和工人失业，因而劳资纠纷迭起。但工人没有忘记自己在工代大会通过的决议，在克服困难过程中，表现了很大的让步。早在一九四九年的年底，上海工人就对年奖问题，表现了这种精神。上海工人在执行中央人民政府所颁布的公营企业的年奖办法上是坚决拥护的；而在私营企业中，为了照顾大局，也表现了同样精神，计算起来全市私营企业工人的年奖，普遍较一九四八年少拿百分之三十至五十。在“二、六”轰炸以后，为了维持生产，上海工人就主动地向资方作了更大的让步，以求尽量维持生产。这样的情况是普遍的，充分贯彻了劳资两利的基本方针，共同克服当前的困难。但也有个别资方，不了解政府的政策，不负责任的弃厂出走了，而工人设法苦撑把它维持下来，等待资方回来。如上海私营鸿丰纱厂的资方，在上海解放前夕，即往香港，其所派代理人亦不负责任，工人被积欠工资五期，代办米六期及全部考勤奖金，使工人生活陷于绝境。当时工人即在工会领导下，说服了资方代理人，组织了“生产维持委员会”，向花纱布公司接洽代纺，使一万五千锭子转动起来，帮助厂方初步改善了过去腐败的制度，消灭了严重的偷窃现象，空前提高了产量，并节约原料、电力、人工很多，做到了保本自给，进一步并有盈余。而且，工人为了补充周转资金，购买电力，宁可省拿工钱，每月最少的只拿三十六个折实单位。
    上海的私营厂占数很大，情况复杂，要搞好生产，必须使劳资关系正常化，并订立集体合同以发展生产为中心任务。在这方面，上海工人响应了全总号召，通过建立劳资协商会议，来达到这个目的。至目前为止，已建立了产业性的劳资协商会议七三个，厂单位的四二七个。目前已订立或正在起草中的业别性的集体合同，有照相业、造纸业、驼绒业、酒酱业、茶叶业、袜针业、沐浴业、三轮车业等。
    在“二、六”轰炸以后，失业工人骤然增加起来。然而，上海工人在共产党与人民政府领导下，以最大的努力，一方面维持了生产，另一方面则在政府和全总支持之下，发动了救济上总失业弟兄的工作。四月中，失业人数估计约有十五万左右。上海工人目睹自己弟兄受苦情形，当即由上海总工会报告了全总请求援助并自己动员起来。在上海号召之下，上海工人在工资已经减低的情况下，普遍捐出了一天工资，共九、○○六、六四五、六九四·六五元，上海各界人民和机关部队一致响应，也捐出了六、七九七、五二二、三六○元。同时全总号召全国工人发扬阶级友爱，要全国在业工人捐献一天工资救济失业工人，共二百八十余亿元，其中大部分救济了上海失业工人。由于中央人民政府政务院的决定，成立了上海市失业工人救济委员会（在此以前，就成立了临时救济委员会）进行工作。这样，使得失业工人普遍得到紧急救济，救济了失业职工九万多及其家属十三万多人，一部失业工人获得返乡、转业，另外则组织了以工代赈六千余人，失业工人学习班一万八千余人。这一工作在各级工会协助推动之下，正在普遍进行中。
    由于敌人留下来的及加之于我们的困难的严重存在，上海工人的生产任务，首先是克服困难。同时，对生产工作加强领导，进一步推动，特别是组织生产竞赛。这虽然做得不够，但比较有成绩的如：公营中纺七厂建立了车间联系合同，掀起红旗竞赛的热潮，该厂在三月份成品平均是五八·六六分，是上海出品最坏的厂，在联系合同努力推行下，二个月的时间，成品的质量平均八二·八五分，获得上海市成品质量第一位。又如上海市公共交通公司在推行了负责制以后，节约了大批器材燃料，从每加仑汽油行驶七·八公里，提高到一○·三公里，个别的创造了一四·三公里的最高纪录，原先每月需政府贴补数十万个折实单位，自负责制推行以后已逐渐做到保本自给。其他如中纺十一厂，通过了建立工厂管理委员会，初步使生产走上了正规。私营明华药房，在工会的领导下，创造了在店员中展开竞赛的办法，克服了困难。当然，工人群众的创造力是无限的，在各项生产工作中特别在实行工厂管理民主化、负责制、联系合同、劳动公约的工作中，涌现了大批生产中的劳动模范。上海市第一届劳模大会，各厂评选的劳模计有二千七百七十七人之多，经市评模委员会正式评定的有六百七十三人，他们通过了上海市劳模大会，推出了自己的代表十五人来京参加全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议。其中如上电的张世宝在“二、六”轰炸时，坚持三十六个小时抢修；慎昌五金制造厂的技工潘阿耀，花去私蓄二十万元，发明了无缝铜管；上海公共交通公司的工程师张德庆，在工人的协助下，发明了白煤车，撙节了大量人民财产；其他则或为生产节约提高质量的模范，或为支援前线的功臣，都是工人群众公认的。这是上海工人阶级英勇带头克服困难，维持生产的具体表现。在这基础上面，上海总工会号召进一步的搞好生产，组织生产竞赛，以巩固和扩大生产战线上的胜利。
    上海总工会根据上海市第一届工人代表大会上所通过的决议，对加强产业工会，采用了具体部署，并成立了二十五人以上的工会基层组织一千七百七十四个；二十五人以下的四千二百九十九个。曾几次派遣干部下厂，了解情况帮助工作，最近又专门派遣干部下厂，有重点的研究健全基层组织的办法。在文化教育方面，除了全市正规的工人业余学校一○六所外，并举办了各种学习班、讲座，培养了一些工会工作的骨干。在沪西、沪中区建造了工人俱乐部及文化宫，在沪东成立了劳动公园，以加强工人业余文娱活动。对工厂安全卫生工作也经常派遣干部，下厂进行调查研究，发动群众来推动工作，其中如中纺十七厂就是很好的例子，现在饭堂、厕所已清洁了，改进了托儿所，并通过大扫除清洁竞赛，改进设备，开展体格检查等等，使工人增加对生产的积极性。其他各项工作也在推进中。
    上海工人在过去一年中，用一切努力来克服困难搞好生产，深知只有这样，才能对国际主义的保卫世界和平的伟大事业有着最好的贡献。上海工人一再以满腔热情来欢迎世界工人弟兄和和平盟友的光临，并引以为荣。在庆祝中央人民政府成立之后，苏联文化艺术科学工作者代表团；亚澳各国工人代表、妇女代表等连续来沪，上海工人欢欣鼓舞的组织欢迎队，半夜至车站迎接，开万人欢迎大会，请他们参观工厂，交流斗争经验，加强保卫世界和平的信心。工人特别热衷于向苏联老大哥学习生产建设和工会工作的经验。上海工人是热爱和平的。在中国保卫世界和平大会的号召及在其上海分会的领导下，上海工人连其家属在内签名保卫世界和平的有一、五九九、九七一人。今年八一中国人民解放军建军节，在反对美国侵略台湾、朝鲜运动中，上海工人六万人联合了各界人民共计十万人，从夜半起即汇合开会，会后举行游行示威，以坚决的行动，来反对美帝国主义的侵略，表示了保卫世界和平的决心。
    （三）团结努力，为争取国家财经情况的基本好转而奋斗
    一年来，上海工人在工会组织领导之下，基本上完成了克服困难、维持生产的艰巨任务，并在其他各项工作上表现了一定的成绩。但整个上海工人运动，还存在着很多的缺点。上海工会工作在工人组织起来以后，并没能够及时的深入与巩固，使之从轰轰烈烈的大运动基础上，转向充实日常工作内容上去。主要原因是工会工作面向生产以及与广大工人群众密切联系很为不够。这表现在组织工作上没有大量的培养干部和积极分子，以巩固组织；并有形式主义的偏向。在工作作风上，不善于保护工人阶级的日常利益，并有着强迫命令、包办代替的严重脱离群众的现象。在劳资关系上，也有着若干不适当的行为。总之，上海的情况是复杂的，主观力量跟不上形势的迅速发展。为了搞好生产，继续克服困难，上海总工会在中华全国总工会领导之下，提出了今后的方针与任务：集中力量，面向生产，搞好生产，组织生产竞赛；做好救济失业工人的工作，以利恢复和发展生产。为了贯彻以上方针，上海工会干部正在检查与总结工作，整顿工会组织与干部的作风，提高与培养干部，改善各级工会工作中的领导方式与方法。
    上海工人阶级数十年来在自己的先锋队——中国共产党的领导下，经过了长期的艰苦斗争，才得到了自己的解放。解放后，又通过了各种斗争，度过了最困难的一年。在目前国家财政经济情况业已开始初步好转的情况下；当此庆祝第二个国庆佳节的时候，上海工人一定会再接再厉，团结努力，为实现毛主席所交给的任务：“争取国家财政经济情况的基本好转而奋斗！”
          一九五○年国庆日
