    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] A commemorative meeting for the 27th anniversary of the founding of "China Youth" was held in Beijing at 4:00 PM on the 20th. More than 60 people from youth and cultural circles attended the meeting. Yang Shu, the head of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Youth League and concurrently the president of China Youth Press, delivered a speech, saying that "China Youth" should inherit its historical fighting tradition and strengthen its integration with reality and connection with the masses. Subsequently, Mao Dun, Hu Sheng, Hu Feng, and Tian Yiling, a student from Tsinghua University, spoke. They unanimously pointed out that the characteristics of "China Youth" are its purposefulness, planning, having a central focus, and raising and solving problems according to the needs of young people. However, it needs to further strengthen its integration with the characteristics of young people and carry out ideological education with vivid and concrete facts, so that "China Youth" can become an even more intimate and good friend to young people. "China Youth" was founded on October 20, 1923, and was edited by Yun Daiying, an outstanding leader of the revolutionary youth movement at that time. It was re-published in Yan'an during the Anti-Japanese War. Currently, the publication is the organ of the China New Democratic Youth League.
