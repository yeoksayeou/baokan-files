　　"Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!"
    Chinese Edition, Issue 58 Introduction
    [Xinhua News Agency, 15th] The Chinese edition of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!", Issue 58 (Total Issue 97) has been published.
    The editorial of this issue is entitled "Marxist-Leninist Education of Communist and Workers' Party Cadres". The editorial points out: The great theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, the all-conquering Marxist-Leninist theory, are an incomparably powerful ideological weapon in the hands of the working class and its vanguard, the Communist and Workers' Parties. The Communist and Workers' Parties deeply understand the decisive significance and importance of ideological work, political work, and the Marxist-Leninist education of cadres. The editorial states: Whether in socialist, new democratic, or capitalist countries, the political education of cadres and Marxist-Leninist training play an exceptionally valuable role. After pointing out the great achievements of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries in propagating Marxism-Leninism over the past two years, the editorial says: We should not be complacent with the achievements we have already made and should strive to improve cadres in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism. In order to improve the level of Marxist-Leninist ideological propaganda, it is necessary to expand the methods of propaganda, such as lectures, discussions, and forums. The methods of teaching and the methods of self-study must be improved. The editorial states: It is necessary to vigorously overcome academic propaganda and propaganda work that is divorced from the current tasks of the Party. The Party's propaganda must be combative, take the initiative, and must be closely linked with revolutionary practice, the practice of class struggle, and the political tasks arising from the international situation. The role of propaganda, in order to enable the Party's cadres to more clearly understand revolutionary practice, is to arm communists with the Party's propaganda. The editorial concludes by emphasizing: Marxism-Leninism is the laboring class's combative and active theory. Propaganda of this theory must be helpful to further consolidate and strengthen the political training of Communist and Workers' Party cadres and to successfully complete the huge and complex tasks facing the cadres. Propaganda work must cultivate in communists and all working people a high degree of confidence in the complete victory of our cause, cultivate their love and loyalty to the great Soviet Union, the banner of peace, and their deep hatred for the imperialist warmongers and their spies in the working class.
    This issue prominently features an essay by Pop Tormov, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, to commemorate the sixth anniversary of Bulgaria's liberation, entitled "Six Years of the Bulgarian People's Regime", and excerpts from letters written by American Communist Party General Secretary Dennis in prison, entitled "American Prison Letters". This issue also publishes essays by Elban, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, entitled "The Improvement of the Living Standards of the Working People of Czechoslovakia", and by Raman, Secretary-General of the Belgian Communist Party, entitled "The Struggle of the Belgian Working People Against the Imperialist Reactionaries".

    中文版第五十八期介绍
    【新华社十五日讯】“争取持久和平，争取人民民主!”中文版第五十八期（总第九十七期）已出版。
    该刊本期的社论题为“共产党与工人党干部的马列主义教育”。社论指出：马、恩、列、斯的伟大学说，战胜一切的马列主义理论，乃是工人阶级及其先锋队共产党与工人党手中的一个无比的、有力的思想武器。共产党和工人党深深知道思想工作、政治工作以及干部的马列主义教育之决定意义的重要性。社论称：不论在社会主义、新民主主义或资本主义的国家里，干部的政治教育，马列主义训练起着一种异常宝贵的作用。社论于指出各国共产党与工人党两年来在宣传马列主义的巨大成就后说：对于已有的成绩不要自满，并应为以马列主义精神提高干部而努力。为了提高马列主义思想宣传的水平，必须扩充宣传的方式，诸如演讲、讨论会、座谈会等。必须改进教授的方法、自学的方法等方面。社论称：必须大力克服学院式的宣传，和脱离当前党的任务的宣传工作。党的宣传必须有战斗性，采取主动，而且必须和革命实践、阶级斗争的实践以及由国外情势而产生的政治任务密切地联系起来。宣传的作用，为了使党的干部更清楚地认识革命实践，是要以党的宣传把共产党人武装起来。社论最后着重称：马列主义是劳动阶级的战斗性的积极的学说。宣传这种学说，必须尽量有助于进一步巩固和加强共产党和工人党干部的政治锻炼、胜利地完成干部们所面临的巨大复杂的任务。宣传工作必须培养共产党员及一切劳动人民对于我们事业彻底胜利的高度信心，培养他们对和平旗手——伟大的苏联的热爱和忠诚，对于帝国主义战争贩子以及他们在劳动阶级中的奸细的深恶痛绝。
