　　My Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Issues Statement on UN General Assembly's Illegal Passage of the Eight-Nation Proposal
    The Chinese People Firmly Oppose the US Expanding its War of Aggression in Korea
    The US military is actively deploying to cross the 38th parallel on a large scale, attempting to extend the flames of its war of aggression to the Chinese border. The Chinese people cannot ignore this serious situation. The aggressors must be held responsible for all consequences of their reckless actions.

    On October 7th, the United Nations General Assembly, under the manipulation of the United States, passed the bloody proposal of the United Kingdom, Australia, and other eight countries, authorizing the United States to invade the entire Korean Peninsula, and rejected the just proposal of the Soviet Union and other five countries for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. At the same time, the US invading forces in Korea are actively deploying and crossing the 38th parallel on a large scale, expanding the war of aggression against Korea. The Foreign Ministry spokesperson issued the following statement on this matter:

    The proposal of the United Kingdom, Australia, and other eight countries passed by the United Nations General Assembly on October 7th under the manipulation of the United States is completely illegal and violates the will of the vast majority of people worldwide. This proposal states that the United Nations should "take all appropriate steps to ensure stability in all of Korea," but its essence is to authorize the US and its accomplice countries' invading forces in Korea to invade and occupy the entire Korean Peninsula and further expand the war of aggression in Korea. Under these circumstances, the so-called "free elections" in Korea, "establishment of a unified, independent, and democratic government," and "completion of the economic revival of Korea" are nothing more than deceptive lies to cover up the US and its accomplice countries' extension of the war and expansion of aggression. The US government has illegally usurped the name of the United Nations to launch a war of aggression against Korea and is now usurping the name of the United Nations to expand the war of aggression against Korea. The US government, which has long intended to expand the war of aggression in Korea, should bear primary responsibility for this illegal and bloody resolution; however, all of the US accomplice countries cannot escape their due responsibility.

    The passage of this bloody proposal is completely illegal and violates the will of the vast majority of people in all of Korea and around the world. Formally speaking, the United States manipulated its voting machine in the United Nations, allowing the proposal to pass in the United Nations with 47 votes in favor, 5 votes against, and 7 abstentions. But everyone knows that these 47 votes in favor absolutely cannot represent the people of those countries; for example, the vote of the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang is simply a huge joke. Even if the 46 votes besides the Chiang bandits have some semblance of legitimacy, how many people do these 46 countries have? 660 million people. However, the five countries led by the Soviet Union that opposed the proposal, plus the People's Republic of China, which also firmly opposed the proposal, together represent 722 million people. The opposing votes, plus the minimum of the seven abstentions and one reservation, which do not approve of the proposal, represent 1.196 billion people. Of the 1.855 billion people in the 60 countries participating in the United Nations, only the countries "representing" 660 million people (that is, about one-third of the total population of the United Nations countries) approved the proposal. Can the passage of this proposal be considered legal? Is it representative? The "majority" that the United States manipulates in the United Nations is actually a "representative" minority. The "majority" that the United States manipulates in the United Nations is not only actually a minority, but most of them are a minority with less connection to the Korean issue. On the other hand, the major Asian countries closely related to the Korean issue—China, the Soviet Union, and India—oppose or disapprove of the proposal. The people of all Asian countries have understood that "Asian affairs should be managed by the Asian people themselves." However, the US government is attempting to usurp the name of the United Nations, exclude the major Asian countries, and unilaterally resolve a major current issue in Asia—the Korean issue. This will not work and is doomed to failure.

    The Chinese people resolutely oppose this illegal "resolution" to expand the war of aggression in Korea passed by the United Nations General Assembly under the manipulation of the United States. Although the United Nations General Assembly, under the manipulation of the United States, rejected the proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue put forward by the Soviet Union and other five countries, we still believe that the proposal of the Soviet Union and other five countries is the only proposal that can peacefully and reasonably resolve the Korean issue and guarantee the independence, unity, and democracy of Korea. This proposal first advocates an immediate ceasefire between the warring parties in Korea, which is a peaceful proposal. This proposal advocates the withdrawal of the US and other countries' troops from Korea, which is a proposal to guarantee the independence of Korea and provide the necessary conditions for national self-determination. This proposal advocates that an equal number of representatives from the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the National Assembly of South Korea organize and preside over free elections for all the Korean people, and advocates that these elections be held under the supervision of a United Nations committee with the participation of neighboring countries bordering Korea, which is a proposal to ensure the completion of Korean reunification on a fair and reasonable basis. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has stated more than once that the Korean issue must and can be resolved peacefully. The proposal of the Soviet Union and other five countries is precisely such a uniquely reasonable and just proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and to guarantee the independence, unity, and democracy of Korea. Although the United Nations General Assembly, under the manipulation of the United States, rejected this fair and reasonable peace proposal, the US aggressive bloc cannot thwart the indomitable will of hundreds of millions of people around the world striving for peace as embodied in this proposal. The Chinese people fully support the proposal put forward by the Soviet Union and others and believe that this is the only feasible path to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    The United States manipulated the United Nations, rejected the proposals of the Soviet Union and other five countries, and even rejected the compromise proposal put forward by the Indian representative to establish a small committee to review various proposals on the Korean issue, and passed the proposal put forward by the United Kingdom, Australia, and other eight countries at the instigation of the United States, the purpose of which is to usurp the name of the United Nations once again to expand the war of aggression in Korea. Therefore, as early as before the proposal of the United Kingdom, Australia, and other eight countries was illegally passed, the US invading forces in Korea had already partially crossed the 38th parallel along with its puppet troops, the Li pseudo-army; currently, it is actively deploying to cross the 38th parallel on a large scale, attempting to extend the flames of its war of aggression to the Chinese border. The US war of aggression against Korea has seriously threatened China's security from the beginning. The US armed forces invading Korea have repeatedly violated China's airspace, strafed and bombed the Chinese people, and disrupted the navigation rights of Chinese merchant ships on the high seas, conducting forced searches. Its intention to expand the Eastern war has already been obvious. Now, the US military is attempting to cross the 38th parallel on a large scale; the Chinese people cannot ignore this serious state of affairs and the dangerous trend of expanding the war by the US and its accomplice countries' aggression against Korea. Premier Zhou Enlai said: "The Chinese people love peace, but in order to defend peace, they have never been and will never be afraid to resist wars of aggression." The Chinese people resolutely advocate a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and resolutely oppose the US and its accomplice countries expanding the war of aggression in Korea; at the same time, they are even more determined that all aggressors must be held responsible for all the consequences of their own reckless acts of expanding aggression.

　　我外交部发言人就联大非法通过八国提案事发表声明
    中国人民坚决反对美国扩大侵朝战争
    美军正积极部署大规模地越过“三八”线，企图把侵略战争的火焰延烧到中国边境，中国人民对于这种严重状态不能置之不理。侵略者要对他们疯狂行为的一切后果负责。
    【新华社十日讯】十月七日，联合国大会在美国操纵下通过了英、澳等八国授权美国侵略整个朝鲜的血腥提案，否决了苏联等五国和平解决朝鲜问题的公正提案；与此同时，美国侵朝军队积极部署，大规模地越过“三八”线，扩大侵略朝鲜的战争。外交部发言人特就此发表下列声明：
    十月七日联合国大会在美国操纵下所通过的英、澳等八国提案，它的通过是完全非法的，违反全世界绝大多数人民意志的。这个提案说什么联合国应“采取一切适当的步骤，以保证全朝鲜情况的稳定”，其实质就是授权美国及其帮凶国家的侵朝军队侵略和占领整个朝鲜，并进一步扩大侵朝战争。在这种情况下，所谓在朝鲜进行“自由选举”、“建立统一、独立和民主的政府”、“完成朝鲜的经济复兴”，都不过是掩护美国及其帮凶国家延长战争与扩大侵略的骗人鬼话。美国政府非法地盗用了联合国之名，发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，如今又盗用联合国之名，扩大侵朝战争。美国政府早已蓄意扩大侵朝战争，应该对这一非法的血腥决议负主要的责任；但所有美国的帮凶国家都不能逃避他们应有的责任。
    这一个血腥提案的通过是完全非法的，违反全朝鲜和全世界绝大多数人民的意志的。从形式上说，美国操纵了它在联合国的投票机器，使得这个提案在联合国得以四十七票赞成，五票反对及七票弃权通过。但谁都知道，这四十七票赞成票，是绝对不能代表这些国家的人民的；例如蒋介石残余匪帮的一票简直是一个天大的笑话。即使算蒋匪以外的四十六票具有某种意义上的合法性吧，这四十六国有多少人口呢？六亿六千万人口；而反对这个提案的以苏联为首的五国加上同样坚决反对这一提案的中华人民共和国，却一共代表了七亿二千二百万人民。反对票加上最低限度不赞成这个提案的七张弃权票和一张保留票所代表的国家，则有十一亿九千六百万人民。参加联合国的六十国共十八亿五千五百万人口中，只有所谓代表六亿六千万人口的国家（即全联合国国家人口的约三分之一）赞成这个提案，这个提案的通过能算是合法的吗？具有代表性的吗？美国在联合国所操纵的“多数”，其实正是“代表”少数；美国在联合国所操纵的“多数”不仅实际上是少数，而且大部分是与朝鲜问题关系较少的少数，但另一方面，与朝鲜问题有密切关系的亚洲主要国家——中国、苏联与印度，却是反对或者不赞成这个提案的。全亚洲国家的人民都已懂得“亚洲的事务应由亚洲人民自己来管”。但美国政府却企图盗用联合国的名义，摒除亚洲的主要国家，来独断地解决亚洲当前的一个重大问题——朝鲜问题，这是行不通的，一定要失败的。
    中国人民坚决反对联合国大会在美国操纵之下所通过的这个扩大侵略朝鲜战争的非法“决议”。联合国大会虽然在美国操纵之下否决了苏联等五国所提和平解决朝鲜问题的提案，但我们仍然认为苏联等五国提案是唯一能够和平合理地解决朝鲜问题，并保证朝鲜的独立、统一和民主的提案。这个提案首先主张在朝鲜的交战双方立刻停战，这是一个和平的提案。这个提案主张撤退美国及其他国家在朝鲜的军队，这是保证朝鲜的独立并提供民族自决的必要条件的一个提案。这个提案主张由朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议及南朝鲜国民议会的同等数目的议员，组织与主持全体朝鲜人民的自由选举，并主张这一选举须在有与朝鲜接壤的邻国参加的联合国委员会监督之下举行，这是保证在公平合理的基础上完成朝鲜统一的一个提案。中华人民共和国中央人民政府曾不止一次地表示过，朝鲜问题必须而且能够得到和平解决。苏联等五国提案正是这样一个和平解决朝鲜问题并保证朝鲜的独立、统一和民主的唯一合理与正当的提案。联合国大会虽然在美国操纵之下否决了这个公平合理的和平提案，但美国侵略集团却不能挫折这个提案所体现的全世界亿万人民争取和平的不屈不挠的意志。中国人民完全支持苏联等所提的提案，并认为这是和平解决朝鲜问题唯一可行的道路。
    美国操纵了联合国，否决了苏联等五国提案，甚至也否决了印度代表所提的成立一个小组委员会以审查各项关于朝鲜问题提案的折衷提案，而通过了美国所指使英、澳等八国所提出的提案，其目的在于再一次盗用联合国的名义，扩大侵朝战争。因此早在英、澳等八国提案被非法通过之前，美国侵朝军队就已部分地随同它的傀儡部队李伪军越过“三八”线；目前它正积极部署着大规模地越过“三八”线，企图把侵略战争的火焰延烧到中国边境。美国侵略朝鲜的战争，一开始就严重地威胁着中国的安全，美国侵略朝鲜的武装力量多次侵犯了中国的领空，扫射轰炸中国人民，破坏中国商船在公海上的航行权利，进行强制盘查，其扩大东方战争的企图本已昭然若揭。现在，美军更企图大规模越过“三八”线；中国人民对于美国及其帮凶国家侵略朝鲜的这种严重状态和扩大战争的危险趋势，不能置之不理。周恩来总理说：“中国人民热爱和平，但是为了保卫和平，从不也永不害怕反抗侵略战争。”中国人民坚决主张和平解决朝鲜问题，坚决反对美国及其帮凶国家扩大侵朝战争；同时，更坚决认定：所有侵略者，必须对于他们自己扩大侵略的疯狂行为的一切后果负责。
