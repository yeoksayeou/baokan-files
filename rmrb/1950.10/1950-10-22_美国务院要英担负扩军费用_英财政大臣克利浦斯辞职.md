　　Xinhua News Agency, October 21st: London dispatch: The British government announced on the 19th that British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps had "resigned due to illness," and that the current Minister for Economic Affairs, Gaitskell, would succeed him as Chancellor of the Exchequer.

　　According to a Reuter's dispatch from London on the 19th, Cripps' resignation was the result of a recent statement by the U.S. State Department, which stated that Britain should bear the full cost of its expansion plan. This threatens the foundation of Cripps' so-called "prosperity plan." Cripps vaguely expressed dissatisfaction in cabinet meetings, saying that American policy would "undermine" the British Labour government's plans, ultimately subverting the Labour government.

　　美国务院要英担负扩军费用
    英财政大臣克利浦斯辞职
    【新华社二十一日讯】伦敦消息：英国政府于十九日宣布：英财政大臣克利浦斯“因病辞职”，由现任经济事务大臣贾兹克尔继任财政大臣。
    据电通社伦敦十九日电指出：克利浦斯的辞职是美国国务院最近的一项声明的结果。该项声明称：英国应负担扩军计划的全部费用。这就使得克利浦斯的所谓“繁荣计划”因缺乏基础而受到威胁。克利浦斯曾在内阁会议中隐约表示不满说：美国的政策，将会“破坏”英国工党政府的计划，从而最后颠覆工党政府。
