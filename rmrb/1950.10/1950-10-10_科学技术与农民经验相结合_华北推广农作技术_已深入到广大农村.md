Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Improving farming techniques and increasing yields have become a common demand of liberated farmers after land reform. This year, the agricultural technology promotion work in North China has achieved significant results based on this foundation.

For a long time, agricultural technology promotion work was limited to a few agricultural technicians and some farmers, but this year, during the production increase campaign, it has penetrated deep into the vast number of farmers. The focus of improving farming techniques this year is mainly on promoting superior varieties and preventing and controlling diseases and pests. The Five-Year Popularization of Improved Varieties Plan proposed by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has been widely supported by farmers in various regions after publicity and education. Shanxi Province plans to promote improved varieties on five million mu this year. In the first half of the year, 31 counties alone promoted 300,000 mu of improved varieties of coarse grains and more than 92,000 mu of pure-bred Sz cotton. Among them, Jincheng masses mutually purchased, exchanged, and adjusted improved varieties on 186,700 mu. Hebei promoted more than 850,000 mu of improved cotton this year. During the summer harvest this year in Pingyuan Province, farmers carried out large-scale wheat selection. In Xinxiang and other ten counties alone, a total of more than 2.24 million jin of improved varieties such as Bald Head Wheat were selected. The crop comparison campaign carried out in various places during the autumn harvest made farmers realize the benefits of improved varieties, and therefore the field selection campaign has penetrated into every household.

The work of seed soaking and seed mixing, which was carried out to prevent and control diseases and pests and ensure the good growth of seedlings, has also been promoted by the broad masses of farmers. The vast majority of spring-sown land in Chahar this year has been soaked. In Shanyin and other counties, warm water soaking accounts for about 65 percent of the total spring-sown land. In Shanxi, seed soaking and seed mixing reached 77 percent of the province's sown area. In Jincheng County, only a hundred mu of grain were soaked last year, but this year the soaking area has increased to more than 190,000 mu. In Anyang County, Pingyuan Province, more than 260 villages have set up "small farms" to carry out seed soaking and germination experiments. In addition, the control of already occurring diseases and pests has also been very effective. After insect pests occurred in Shanxi this summer, the People's Government used 500 sprayers and more than 70,000 jin of Dithane and other agents, in cooperation with the broad masses, to eliminate cotton aphids on 980,000 mu. Farmers in Hebei Province used 8,800 sprayers and 25,000 jin of various agents supplied by the People's Government, combined with soil agents such as tobacco stalks, to eliminate cotton aphids in 98 counties and fire spiders in more than 40 counties.

Local people's governments have given strong support and assistance to the farmers' demands for improving agricultural production technology. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government invested 800,000 jin of rice to help farmers select superior wheat varieties. Hebei and Pingyuan provinces have issued nearly 10 million jin of high-quality cotton seeds. In promoting seed soaking, seed mixing, and pest control, the People's Government has done its best to help solve the difficulties of agents and equipment. The five provinces have lent and sold a total of 45,000 sprayers and more than 220,000 jin of various pesticides. In addition to this material assistance, the training and dispatch of agricultural technicians have also increased several times compared with previous years. Hengshui County in Hebei Province alone has trained 1,000 cotton planting technicians. Farmers in various places have enthusiastically accepted this support and have also spontaneously established technology promotion organizations and widely established superior variety breeding households and specially appointed farmers. In 102 villages in Shulu and other six counties in Hebei Province alone, 270 technical research groups have been established, with 1,082 promotion households participating, forming 17 promotion networks.

The common experience gained in agricultural technology promotion work in various places is that only when science and technology are combined with farmers' experience can the work of promoting farming technology truly become a mass movement. Yushe County in Shanxi Province promoted the experience of farmers in Dazhai Village in improving the soil by mixing sandy alkali soil, turning 2,000 mu of alkaline land into fertile fields. Zhao Dewang's mutual aid team in Qinquan Village, Zuoquan County, studied methods of fertilizing different lands (such as putting night soil on the sunny slopes and chicken and pigeon manure on the shady slopes). After research and promotion by the local people's government, the yield of crops has greatly increased. Farmers in Hebei and Pingyuan provinces have created wooden sprayers and replaced agents with tobacco stalk water, which solved the difficulties of insufficient sprayers and agents in pest control. These are all good examples. Conversely, the leaders of individual regions and farms unilaterally emphasized science and technology and did not pay attention to the existing experience of the masses, which resulted in the promotion work being limited to a very small circle, which affected the improvement of agricultural technology.

　　科学技术与农民经验相结合
    华北推广农作技术
    已深入到广大农村
    【新华社八日讯】改进农作技术，提高产量已成为土地改革后翻身农民的普遍要求。今年华北地区的农业技术推广工作，即在此基础上获得了显著的成绩。
    很长时期停留在少数农业技术人员与部分农民中的农业技术推广工作，在今年增产运动中，已深入到广大农民中去。今年改进农作技术的重点主要是推广优良品种、和防治病虫害。中央人民政府农业部所提出的五年普及良种计划，经过宣传教育之后普遍得到各地农民的拥护。山西省今年计划推广良种五百万亩，上半年仅三十一县即推广杂粮优良品种三十万亩，纯种斯字棉九万二千余亩。其中晋城群众互购互换调剂良种达十八万六千七百余亩。河北今年推广良棉八十五万余亩。平原省今年夏收中，农民大量进行小麦选种。仅新乡等十县，即共选秃头麦等良种二百二十四万余斤。秋收中各地所进行的比庄稼运动，更使农民认识了良种的收益，因而田间选种运动，已深入到每一农户中去。
    为防治病虫害保证禾苗良好成长而进行的浸种拌种工作，亦已为广大农民群众所推行。察哈尔今年春播地绝大部分经过浸种。山阴等县温汤浸种约占春播地总数百分之六十五。山西浸种、拌种达全省播种面积百分之七十七。晋城县去年谷物浸种的仅百余亩，今年浸种即增到十九万余亩。平原省安阳县有二百六十多个村开设“小农场”进行浸种发芽试验。另外，对已发生的病虫害的除治，效果也很显著。山西今年夏间发生虫害后，人民政府以五百架喷雾器和七万余斤地利斯等药剂，配合广大群众捕治，消灭了九十八万亩的棉蚜。河北省农民使用人民政府所供给的喷雾器八千八百余架，各种药剂二万五千余斤，配合烟茎等土药剂，消灭了九十八个县所发生的棉蚜，四十多个县所发生的火蜘蛛。
    各地人民政府对于农民改进农业生产技术的要求，均给予了大力的支持和帮助：山西省人民政府为扶助农民选择优种麦，投资即达八十万斤米。河北、平原两省曾贷发优良棉种近千万斤。在推行浸种、拌种、除虫中，人民政府更以全力帮助解决药剂器械等困难。五省共计贷、售喷雾器四万五千架，各种农药二十二万余斤。除了这种物质的援助之外，农业技术人员的训练与派出也较往年增加数倍，河北省仅衡水一县即训练种棉技术员千人。各地农民十分热情地接受了这种支援，亦纷纷自动成立技术推广的组织，广泛建立优种繁殖户、特约农家等，仅河北省束鹿等六县的一百零二个村庄中，即成立了二百七十个技术研究小组，有一千零八十二个推广户参加，组成了十七个推广网。
    各地在农业技术推广工作中所取得的共同经验是，只有在科学技术与农民经验相结合的情况下，推广农作技术的工作才能真正成为群众性的运动。山西榆社县推广了大寨村农民以砂碱土混合改良土壤的经验，使两千亩碱地变成沃田。左权县芹泉村赵德旺互助组，研究不同土地上肥的办法（如圊粪上阳坡、鸡鸽粪上阴坡），经当地人民政府研究与推广后，使农作物产量大为增加。河北、平原两省农民创造了木制喷雾器，以烟茎水代替药剂，结果解决了在防治虫害中喷雾器和药剂不足的困难。这些都是很好的例子。相反地个别地区与农场的领导者，片面强调科学技术，不重视群众已有的经验，结果曾使推广工作限制在极小的圈子内，因而使农业技术的提高受到影响。
