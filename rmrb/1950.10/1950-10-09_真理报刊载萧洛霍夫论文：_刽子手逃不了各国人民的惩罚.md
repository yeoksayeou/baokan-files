Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 24th: Pravda published on September 24th a lengthy article by the famous Soviet writer Sholokhov, entitled "Hangmen cannot escape the punishment of the people of all countries."

He wrote that the Soviet people have always respected and still respect the American working people. Stalin once praised American efficiency. However, at that time he was thinking of the efficiency of labor, while now all honest people in the world curse the criminals, watching with indignation how American pilots cruelly and shamelessly destroy the peaceful residents of Korea, and how mercenaries of the American army, under the guise of the United Nations flag, wage a cruel war against the peace-loving people of those small countries who demand to decide their own destiny without foreign interference.

The Soviet writer pointed out that the American people, in their relatively short history, have produced tens of millions of honest workers and outstanding figures in politics, science, technology, and literature. Their names are remembered not only by the American people, but also by all grateful humanity. However, in today's America, there is a name that is increasingly and frequently condemned with anger and hatred by honest people around the world. This is the current President of the United States, Truman. It was he who first sent planes carrying atomic bombs to Japan. He now says shamelessly: if necessary, I will not hesitate to use the atomic bomb. Sholokhov said that Mr. Truman will always be able to find a "need." Even if he cannot find it himself, his direct Wall Street masters will point it out to him. Sholokhov warned that the angry voices of hundreds of millions of people protesting American intervention in Korea and the use of atomic bombs are like the approaching terrible thunder before a powerful storm washing the earth. The people of all countries have a firm memory, and they will never forgive the crimes of American imperialism and its threat to peace and humanity.

Sholokhov continued, people cannot help but laugh when reading Truman's biography. Here I have an article by Tebble, broadcast by Reuters shortly after Truman was elected president. In this article entitled "Lucky Ordinary Man", Tebble describes what Truman looks like and what clothes he wears, and does not forget to tell readers that he likes to wear a bow tie. Incidentally, among the German fascist war criminals convicted in the Nuremberg trials in New York, many liked fashionable bow ties, but the fact is that they did not end their criminal lives with bow ties, but with a noose. Sholokhov continued, as for such a lack of talent of the person at the head of a country, many Americans who praised "ordinary people", "happy people" - or in other words, mediocrities - were ecstatic about this. Americans should not forget the fact that when the Germans were dragged into fascism, they were also ecstatic that their "leader" was an "ordinary person" and just an ordinary corporal. Sholokhov emphasized: We know what price mankind had to pay for the rule of this despicable mediocrity, "the ordinary German corporal". In his blind madness, he dared to dream of ruling the world.

Sholokhov continued to write: The whole world is unfortunate to have a vicious mediocrity ruling the United States according to the will of the financial giants. Please, these billionaires - Morgan, DuPont, Rockefeller, and Mellon - are often engaged in their plundering activities in dark corners, they are afraid of the light of day and the honest eyes of the working people, so they do not need a great figure or a talented person in the White House, but only a docile servant. Truman showed servile obedience to his masters: he wanted to put the great China, Korea, and Vietnam at the feet of his masters, he wanted to trample the globe. But his feet are too short, and the people of the world who signed against war and against the use of atomic weapons will never allow them to grow longer!

The Soviet writer said: In the American armed intervention in Korea, those who committed the crime of killing tens of thousands of innocent people are not only MacArthur, the bloody executioners, and all the guys who murdered Korean civilians with careless cruelty, but first of all Wall Street and its loyal servant Truman. Where can they escape to avoid the judgment of the people? The court of human conscience and dignity will not forgive them!

Referring to American newspaper comments and personal remarks, Sholokhov pointed out: Truman was and still is a member of the Ku Klux Klan, and he was and still is the embodiment of the despicable character of mankind. He - this despicable hypocrite in the White House, every time he makes any public statement, he never fails to mention God at the beginning or end, and shamelessly uses the religious feelings of ordinary Americans. Sholokhov emphasized: But dawn does not break from the West, and the life-giving sun does not rise from the West.

Mankind will never follow the capitalist's running dogs. Let the American young masters in general's uniforms, who have not yet been properly hit, concentrate on running rampant in the world in the guise of Hitler. Let that "pious" White House resident go crazy and clamor for atomic bombs. Let the demons of the American war industry rub their hands and look forward to future profits. Let the American newspapers and radio stations of mammonism do everything possible to slander and smear the Soviet people and our own Communist Party. We will not waver. We have the immortal ideas of communism and the reliable protection of the justice of our cause. All the loyal working people of both hemispheres stand with us!

Our great people have produced from among them the leader of the great working mankind. Thanks to the genius of Lenin and Stalin, we created the heroic Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state. Thanks to Stalin's genius, the world was saved from civilization, and the working people were saved from fascist enslavement, and had a future.

Our leader foresaw the future with the eyes of an eagle. When the capitalist running dogs were clamoring for a new world war, Stalin made valuable contributions to the treasure house of science and created works on linguistics. When those neurotic people who want to get rich from the Third World War talk about new terrible massacres, the Soviet people, inspired by Stalin's genius, are transforming nature, planning afforestation, building hydroelectric power stations on the Volga River and various canals, irrigating deserts, and doing everything to make human life more beautiful and happier! All progressive mankind sees in these huge creative efforts the most convincing proof of the great power of the Soviet state and the Soviet government's consistent peace-loving foreign policy.

Millions of working people everywhere lovingly and trustingly extended their hands to Stalin.

    “刽子手逃不了各国人民的惩罚”
    “全世界都不幸有一个恶毒的庸才遵照金融巨头的意志统治着美国。……杜鲁门对他的主人们表示出奴才般的俯首贴耳：他要把伟大的中国、朝鲜和越南放在他的主人们的脚下，他要践踏全球。但是他的足爪很短，而且签名反对战争反对使用原子武器的全世界人民决不允许它们长得长一些！”
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科九月二十四日电：真理报九月二十四日刊载苏联著名作家萧洛霍夫所撰的长篇论文，题为“刽子手逃不了各国人民的惩罚”。
    他写道，苏维埃人民过去向来非常尊敬而且现在也尊敬美国劳动人民。斯大林有一次曾经赞扬美国的效率。然而当时他心里想的是劳工的效率，而现在全世界的所有正直人民都痛咒凶犯们，以愤慨的心情注视美国飞行员如何残酷无耻地毁灭朝鲜的和平居民，以及美国军队的雇佣兵如何在联合国旗帜掩饰下对那些要求自己决定自己命运而不受外人干涉的爱好和平的小国人民进行残酷的战争。
    这位苏联作家指出，美国人民在他们比较短促的历史过程中，产生出数千万正直的劳动者和政治、科学、技术及文学方面的杰出人物。他们的名字不但为美国人民，并且为所有感恩的人类所牢记不忘。然而在今日的美国，有一个人的名字日益频繁地遭到全世界正直人民愤怒的和痛恨的谴责。这个就是美国现任总统杜鲁门。正是他，首先派出载着原子弹的飞机到日本去。他现在又厚颜无耻地说：如果需要，我将毫不犹豫使用原子弹。萧洛霍夫说，杜鲁门先生将总是可以找到“需要”的。即使如果他自己不能找到，他直接的华尔街主子们也会这样指点他。萧洛霍夫警告说，但抗议美国干涉朝鲜与使用原子弹的亿万人民的愤怒声音，就象在洗清大地的强大暴风雨前逼近的可怖雷声一样。各国人民有牢固的记忆力，他们永不会饶恕美国帝国主义的罪行，及其对和平及人类的威胁。
    萧洛霍夫继续说道，人们在读到杜鲁门传记时，不禁要哑然失笑。我这里有一篇特鲍莱所作的路透社在杜鲁门被选为总统不久后播发的专文。在这篇题为“幸运的平凡人”的专文中，特鲍莱描写杜鲁门是什么样子和穿些什么衣服，并且没有忘记告诉读者他喜欢带领结。附带地讲一下，在纽约伦堡审判中被定罪的德国法西斯战争罪犯中，有不少人喜欢时髦的领结，但事实是，他们不是带着领结结束他们犯罪的生命，而是以套后索结束了犯罪的生命。萧洛霍夫继续说，至于居于一国之首的人的这样缺乏才智的特点，许多赞颂“平常人”、“快乐的人”——或换句话说，庸才——的美国人曾为此狂喜的。美国人不应忘记这一事实：在德国人被拖入法西斯主义的时候，他们也是为他们的“首领”是“寻常人”及仅仅是一个普通的伍长这一事实而狂喜。萧洛霍夫强调说：我们知道人类曾必须为这个可卑的庸才，“普通的德国伍长”的统治付出了什么代价。他在盲目的疯狂中竟敢梦想统治全世界。
    萧洛霍夫继续写道：全世界都不幸有一个恶毒的庸才遵照金融巨头的意志统治着美国。请他们亿万富翁们——摩根、杜邦、洛克菲勒、和梅们经常是在阴暗的角落里，展开他们的掠夺活动，他们害怕白昼的光亮和劳动人民的诚实的眼光，因此他们不需要白宫里有一个伟大的人物或者一个有才智的人，而只需要一个驯服的仆人。杜鲁门对他的主人们表示出奴才般的俯首贴耳：他要把伟大的中国、朝鲜和越南放在他的主人们的脚下，他要践踏全球。但是他的足爪很短，而且签名反对战争反对使用原子武器的全世界人民决不允许它们长得长一些！
    这位苏联作家说：在美国武装干涉朝鲜中犯了杀死成万无辜人民之罪的，不仅是麦克阿瑟，血腥的执行官们和其他以毫不介意的残忍凶杀朝鲜平民的一切家伙们，而且首先就是华尔街和它忠顺的仆人杜鲁门。他们能逃到那里去躲避人民的审判呢？人类良心和尊荣的法庭是不会宽恕他们的！
    萧洛霍夫在提到美国的报纸评论和个人言论时，指出：杜鲁门过去是，现在还是三Ｋ党党员，他过去是，现在还是人类卑鄙性格的化身。他——这个白宫的可卑的虚伪的家伙，每逢发表任何公开声明，没有一次不是在开首时或结束时提到上帝，而且不知羞耻地利用美国普通人民的宗教情感。萧洛霍夫强调说：但是黎明不是从西方破晓的，给人以生命的太阳不是从西方升起的。
    人类永不会追随资本家的走狗。让尚未受到适当打击的穿着将军制服的美国阔少们专心一意地以希特勒的姿态横行世界吧。让那位“虔诚的”白宫居民去发神经，去叫嚣原子弹吧。让美国战争工业的妖魔们擦着他们的手期待着未来的利润吧。让拜金主义的美国报纸与电台尽力使出一切手段拚命毁谤污蔑苏联人民及我们自己的共产党吧。我们是不会动摇的。我们有共产主义的不朽思想与我们事业的正义性的可靠保护。两半球的一切忠诚的劳动人民与我们站在一起！
    我们的伟大人民从他们中间产生了伟大的劳动人类的领袖。由于列宁与斯大林的天才，我们创造了英勇的布尔什维克党与苏维埃国家。由于斯大林的天才，世界才保存了文明，才由法西斯奴役下拯救出劳动人类，并且有了前途。
    我们的领袖以鹰的眼光预见了未来。当资本家的走狗们在叫嚣新的世界大战时，斯大林对科学宝库作了宝贵的贡献，创作了关于语言学的著作。当那些神经衰弱的，要利用第三次世界大战发财的人们谈到新的可怕的大屠杀时，苏联人民在斯大林的天才的启发下正在改造自然、计划植林、在伏尔加河与各运河修筑水力发电站，灌溉沙漠，做一切事情使人类的生活更美丽，更幸福！一切的进步人类在这些巨大的创造性的努力中看见了最具有说服力量的明证，说明苏维埃国家的伟大力量与苏联政府一贯的爱好和平的外交政策的证明。
    各地成百万劳动人民都热爱地信任地向斯大林伸出了他们的手。
