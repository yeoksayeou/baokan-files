　　People's Court of the Continuing Construction District of Beijing and Tianjin
　　[This newspaper dispatch] Beijing and Tianjin are continuing to establish district people's courts. Because the district people's courts have undertaken first-instance work, the municipal people's courts will be able to concentrate their efforts on handling counter-revolutionary cases. On March 8th of this year, the Supreme People's Court and the Ministry of Justice, in view of the concentrated population and numerous cases in large cities, in order to make the work of the courts closer to the people and to handle cases quickly and effectively, jointly issued an order to Beijing and Tianjin to prepare for the establishment of district people's courts, and also issued "Trial Measures for the People's Courts of Beijing and Tianjin Districts," stipulating that the district people's courts are the first-instance courts for handling ordinary criminal and civil cases in their respective cities, and the municipal courts handle appealed cases and relatively major first-instance cases. In the past few months, the courts of Beijing and Tianjin have been carrying out preparatory work under the direct leadership and assistance of the municipal people's governments. The First District Court under the Beijing Municipal People's Court was established in August, and the Second and Third District Courts are now being planned. The Tangda District Court of the Tianjin Municipal People's Court has been established. Now, the Hebei and Hedong District Courts of Tianjin are also ready and will be established within this month. In order to accelerate the establishment of people's courts in the two districts, the Supreme People's Court recently ordered the Beijing and Tianjin Municipal People's Courts to limit the establishment of all people's courts in the two districts within this year. From January next year, the district courts will judge first-instance cases, and the municipal courts will be the second-instance appeal courts. According to the preliminary experience of Beijing and Tianjin in the past two months, the establishment of district people's courts in large cities is a new development in the people's judicial system. First, because it can directly approach the people, it can also more quickly reflect the needs of the people and obtain the supervision of the people, which is of great help in improving judicial work. Second, general criminal and civil cases, especially the large number of civil cases, are mainly tried by the district people's courts, and the municipal people's courts basically become second-instance courts, and they can concentrate their efforts on handling counter-revolutionary and other important cases. The serious backlog of cases in the work of the courts in large cities in the past, and the resulting passive state of work, can also be appropriately resolved.

　　京津续建区人民法院
    【本报讯】京、津两市继续建立区人民法院，由于区人民法院进行了第一审工作，使市人民法院就可能集中力量以处理反革命案件。今年三月八日，最高人民法院和司法部，鉴于大城市人口集中，案件繁多，为使法院工作更进一步接近人民，以迅速有效地处理案件，曾会衔令北京、天津两市分别筹设区人民法院，并随发“京、津两市区人民法院试行办法”，规定区人民法院为各该市办理普通刑事民事案件的第一审法院，市法院办理上诉案件及比较重大的第一审案件。数月来京津两市法院在市人民政府直接领导和帮助之下进行筹备工作。北京市人民法院所属第一区法院业于八月间成立，现正筹设第二和第三区法院。天津市人民法院已成立了塘大区法院。现津市河北、河东两个区法院亦已筹备就绪，将于本月内成立。为加速两地区人民法院的建立，日前最高人民法院又分令京、津两市人民法院限制于今年内将两市区人民法院全部建立起来，自明年一月起，由区法院判决第一审案件，以市法院为第二审上诉法院。根据最近两月京、津两市初步经验，大城市区人民法院的建立，是人民司法制度的一个新的发展。第一、由于它能直接接近人民，因而也就能够更迅速地反映人民的需要，和获得人民的监督，对改进司法工作有很重要的帮助。第二、一般的刑事民事案件，特别是数目众多的民事案件，主要由区人民法院审理了，市人民法院就基本上成为第二审法院，自己就有可能来集中精力处理反革命及其他重要案件。而过去大城市法院工作中严重的积案现象，以及由此而产生的工作上的被动状态，也就有可能获得适当的解决。
