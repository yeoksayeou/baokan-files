Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th. Since May, Shanghai's industry and commerce have shown preliminary signs of improvement, and the improvement has become more significant after July. This is a result of the people's government's vigorous adjustment of industry and commerce, coupled with the good harvests in the summer and autumn this year, which has led to a certain increase in the purchasing power of the vast number of farmers, and the entry of general commodities into the peak sales season.

The improvement in Shanghai's industry and commerce can be seen from several aspects.

First, the decrease in the number of applications for factory and shop closures and contractions, and the increase in the number of applications for resumption of business and establishment of new businesses. Taking July as an example, a total of 401 factories and shops applied for closure and contraction, a decrease of 3,218 from the 3,619 in May; a total of 626 applied for resumption of business and establishment of new businesses, an increase of 508 from the 118 in May. The number of factories and shops resuming business and being newly established was 225 more than the number closing or contracting.

Second, the increase in the quantity of goods produced and sold. The output of major commodities in July that were close to or exceeded January's output included cotton yarn, wool yarn, flour, and cement. Sales that were close to or exceeded January's included cotton yarn, wool yarn, and cement. The output of vegetable oil in July increased by 2.5 times compared to March, and sales increased by 7.8 times. The output and sales of newsprint in July both increased by more than four times compared to March. In May, the value of orders placed by the central government and various regions with Shanghai's private machinery factories was 1,106,901 standard units (approximately 5,300 yuan per unit); in August, it was 4,540,220 standard units (approximately 5,200 yuan per unit). All private machinery factories were able to complete their orders, indicating that the output of the machinery industry is also increasing significantly. In the commercial sector, the average daily turnover of the six major department stores, such as Wing On and Sincere, was as low as 190 million yuan in April, increasing to 350 million yuan in June. Although July and August were slow months, they still increased by more than 30% compared to April.

Third, the increasingly smooth flow of exchange between urban and rural areas. According to statistics from the Railway Bureau and the Shipping Bureau, the exchange of major materials between Shanghai and other regions is as follows: the tonnage of goods transported by water in August increased by 25% compared to April, and the tonnage of goods transported out increased by 132%, creating the highest record of the year. The tonnage of goods transported by rail in August increased by 5% compared to April, and the tonnage transported out decreased slightly (a decrease of 16% compared to April).

Fourth, financial activity. Due to stable prices and the smooth flow of exchange between urban and rural areas, financial conditions are extremely active. The average daily amount of bill exchange in July was 58% higher than in April. The amount remitted out in August increased by 320% compared to January; the amount remitted in increased by 250%. The total deposits in public and private financial institutions in July increased by 269% compared to January, while the total loans increased by 305%.

Fifth, the re-employment of unemployed workers. In July, 4,836 unemployed workers were re-employed, and another 5,510 were re-employed in August, totaling approximately 7% of the total number of unemployed workers. Among those who were re-employed, the dyeing, weaving, and knitting industries accounted for 52.23% of the total.

The preliminary improvement in Shanghai's industry and commerce is primarily a result of the people's government's work in adjusting industry and commerce on the basis of consolidating financial and economic unity, consolidating the balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure, and consolidating price stability, especially the vigorous support for legitimate private industry and commerce.

From April to August this year, the people's government in Shanghai entrusted private textile factories to process 96,986 bales of cotton yarn, more than 1.32 million bolts of cotton cloth, and more than 1.08 million bolts of dyed cloth. Orders for electrical, machinery, and steel industries reached 26.6 million standard units. Loans from public-private firms and banks totaled 3,431.8 billion yuan. State-owned department stores and trade trust companies purchased more than 240 billion yuan of factory inventory in April, May, and June, covering 85% of the city's factories producing daily necessities. In addition, the state has also made adjustments in four aspects: prices, business scope, taxation, and labor-capital relations, which have enabled private manufacturers to reduce costs, expand sales channels, and obtain reasonable profits.

Another important reason for the preliminary improvement in Shanghai's industry and commerce is that state-owned trading agencies united with private merchants to purchase large quantities of agricultural and sideline products from East China, which increased the purchasing power of farmers to a certain extent and increased the demand for industrial products. This year, East China had good harvests of silk, tea, wheat, and rice. For silkworm cocoons alone, the state had purchased 380,000 dan by the end of June. After the new rice came on the market, the state had also purchased more than 50 million jin of rice (calculated at 75% of the weight of paddy rice) from July to mid-September. In addition to public purchases and sales, private merchants, encouraged by reasonable prices and assisted by the state, also carried out large-scale purchases and sales.

In addition, some private industrialists and merchants have played a certain role in striving for improvement by improving management and upgrading equipment with the help and guidance of the people's government.

However, the current improvement in Shanghai's industry and commerce is only preliminary and not fundamental. Some private manufacturers lack sufficient understanding of this and are blindly optimistic, blindly expanding production, and competing to purchase raw materials. This has led to an oversupply of matches as early as early September, with more than 2,000 extra cases; soap inventories have reached more than 200,000 cases, and the main raw material, tallow, has more than doubled in price in the past two months; due to overproduction, the shirt industry is selling at reduced prices, with selling prices generally falling by 10%; other industries such as machine-made briquettes and dyes also have surpluses. Therefore, how to grasp the principle of "determining production based on sales," thoroughly overcome speculative practices, be honest and reliable, improve management, and advance steadily remains the goal of the Shanghai business community.

　　政府大力扶助，人民购买力逐渐提高
    上海私营工商业显著好转
    还应彻底克服投机取巧作风，按销路定产量，改善经营，稳步前进。
    【新华社上海七日电】上海工商业自五月以后已呈初步好转现象，七月以后好转现象更为显著。这是人民政府大力调整工商业，同时今年夏秋两季丰收，广大农民的购买力有一定的提高，一般商品实销进入旺季的结果。
    上海工商业的好转可以从几方面看出来。
    第一是工商业申请停歇紧缩的减少与申请复业创设的增多。以七月份为例，申请停歇紧缩的工厂商店共四○一家，较五月份的三、六一九家减少了三、二一八家；申请复业和创设的共六二六家，较五月份的一一八家增加了五○八家。两者相抵，复业创设的工厂和商店尚多二二五家。
    第二是商品产销数量的增加。七月份主要商品产量已经接近或超过一月份的有棉纱、毛纱、面粉、水泥等项；销量已经接近或超过一月份的有棉纱、毛纱、水泥等项；植物油七月份的产量，较三月份增加二点五倍，销量增加七点八倍；白报纸的产销量，七月份都较三月份增加四倍以上。五月份中央及各地向上海私营机器厂定货值为一百一十万六千九百零一个折实单位（每单位约五千三百余元），八月份为四百五十四万零二百二十个折实单位（每单位约五千二百余元）。各私营机器厂都能完成定货任务、说明机械业产量也在显著地增加。商业方面，永安、先施等六大百货公司每日平均营业额，四月份曾低至一亿九千万元，六月份增达三亿五千万元，七、八月虽为淡月，但仍较四月份增加了百分之三十以上。
    第三是城乡交流的日畅。根据铁路局与航运局统计，上海与外地主要物资交流的情况是：水路货运运入吨数八月较四月增加百分之二十五，运出吨数增加百分之一百三十二，创造了本年以来的最高纪录。铁路货运量运入吨数八月较四月增加了百分之五，运出量略有减少（较四月份减少百分之十六）。
    第四是金融活跃。由于物价稳定，城乡交流日畅，金融情况极为活跃。票据交换每日平均金额，七月份数字高出四月份达百分之五十八。汇出数字，八月份较一月份增加了百分之三百二十；汇入数字增加了百分之二百五十。公私金融业存款数字，七月份较一月份增加了百分之二百六十九，放款数字则增加了百分之三百零五。
    第五是失业工人的复工就业。七月份复工就业的失业工人有四、八三六人，八月份又有五、五一○人，合计约占失业工人总数的百分之七。在复工就业的人数中，染织、复制和针织三业占总数的百分之五十二点二三。
    上海工商业的初步好转，首先是人民政府在巩固财经统一、巩固财政收支平衡和巩固物价稳定的基础上，进行了调整工商业的工作，特别是大力扶植了正当的私营工商业的结果。
    从今年四月到八月，人民政府在上海共委托私营纺织厂加工棉纱九万六千九百八十六件，棉布一百三十二万余匹，染布一百零八万余匹。电器、机械、钢铁等工业订货达二千六百六十万折实单位。公私行庄贷款累计达三万四千三百一十八亿元。国营百货公司和贸易信托公司，四、五、六三个月收购工厂存货达二千四百余亿元，收购对象达全市日用品开工工厂的百分之八十五。此外，国家还在价格、经营范围、税收和劳资关系四方面进行了调整，使得私营厂商减低了成本，推广了销场和获得了合理的利润。
    上海工商业初步好转的另外一个重要原因，是国营贸易机关团结私商大量收购了华东区的农副产品，使农民购买力有一定的提高，需求工业品较多。今年华东丝、茶、麦、稻都丰收，其中仅蚕茧一项，至六月底止国家已收购三十八万担。新稻登场后，七至九月中旬，国家亦已收购五千多万斤大米（稻子以百分之七十五折算）。除了公家的收购和供销外，私商在合理价格的鼓励和国家的协助下，亦进行了大量的收购和供销。
    此外，若干私营工商业者在人民政府的帮助和指导下改善经营，改进设备，对争取好转也起了一定的作用。
    但上海工商业目前只是初步好转，还不是根本好转。若干私营厂商对此认识不足，盲目乐观，盲目扩大生产，竞购原料，已使火柴在九月上旬时即过剩了二千多箱；肥皂存货达二十万箱以上，其主要原料牛油在两上月来上涨了一倍多；衬衫业由于生产过剩，贬价求售，售价一般都跌了百分之十；其他如机制煤球、染料业等亦已有过剩现象。因此，如何掌握“以销定产”的方针，彻底克服投机取巧的作风，老老实实，改善经营，稳步前进，仍是当前上海工商界努力的目标。
