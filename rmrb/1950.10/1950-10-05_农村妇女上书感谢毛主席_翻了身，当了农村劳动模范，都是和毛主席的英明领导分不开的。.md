Rural women who have turned themselves around and become rural labor models all feel it is inseparable from Chairman Mao's wise leadership.

[This Newspaper] The land reform has smashed the feudal forces that hindered the development of rural production, and at the same time, it has removed the ideological shackles imposed on the working people by the feudal forces. For thousands of years, the broad masses of rural women who have been the most oppressed have turned themselves around, gained equal status in society and economy, and gained freedom and liberation in their thinking. During the celebration of the National Day, many women in the countryside who had turned themselves around after the land reform wrote letters to Chairman Mao to congratulate themselves on their liberation and to express their heartfelt gratitude to Chairman Mao. The following are excerpts from some of the original letters.

Jiang Xiuqin from Da Wu Family Village, Qingbei Village, Third District, Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, wrote to Chairman Mao as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:

In the old society, I was a poor girl from a poor family. My family was very poor. Since I was liberated under your leadership, I have been allocated land, houses, livestock, and production tools. Therefore, our lives have gradually improved, and we have enough to eat and wear. I am a poor girl, and today I am also honored to become a member of the Communist Party and a special-class labor model in the county.

All of this is due to your leadership and education. It is you who gave me this grace, and I am very grateful to you.

This year is a year of bumper harvest. The crops are growing strong and strong. During this year's autumn harvest, I will definitely give play to the role that a labor model should play, and mobilize men, women, old and young, especially women, to work together to do a good job in the autumn harvest.

Du Xiulan from Taiping Village, Sixth District, Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, wrote to Chairman Mao: Dear Chairman Mao:

We women were oppressed by imperialism and feudal forces in the past. At that time, I felt really depressed. I wondered why we women were subjected to such unequal treatment? Why should we be slaves to the rich and not get a free life? Since August 15th, after the Eighth Route Army liberated the Northeast, the people were liberated and the women gained freedom, free from the oppression of men. Women also have status in society, and the depression in my heart has disappeared.

My husband joined the Seventh Independent Regiment in 1948. After he left, my child and I, two people, lived at home. With the care of the district and village government, and by my own labor, I made a living. In 1949, I participated in the work of the Women's Federation and had close contact with the women's exchange groups and the masses. In January of this year, I gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. Since then, I have been more active and responsible in my work. In February, I was selected as a second-class labor model at the county labor model conference. At the same time, I was determined to improve the political awareness of women, maintain close contact with the masses, set a good example for the masses, and complete the tasks assigned to me by the Party.

Hu Xiulan from Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, said in her letter to Chairman Mao: Respected Chairman Mao:

In the past, we were oppressed as cattle and horses, exploited to the point of not being able to survive, insulted and trampled upon. Today, the vast number of rural women in our country have been liberated from the clutches of bandits. I am also one of them. In the past, I had no house, no land, and six or seven members of my family ate this meal and missed that meal. Often, we couldn't even eat one meal a day. We had to say many good things and beg to rent a little land from the landlord. We couldn't even save two dou of rice a year after working for people. The whole family often cried because there was no rice to cook. Because I had little to eat and wear, I was afraid of being laughed at, and I didn't even dare to go out on the street. I worked day and night. The old society simply didn't treat us poor people as human beings.

After I turned myself around, I was allocated six qing of land and three houses. But the Kuomintang came to attack the liberated areas again. In order to protect the fruits of the struggle, I mobilized my husband to join the army. I also led women to participate in the struggle at home. In 1948, I gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. Women had no status in the old society, but now they can also control the government. Last year, I was elected as a member of the village government. Because of my hard work, I also became a second-class model in the county. In the past, I didn't know a single word, but now I can read and write letters. Not only do I know how to read, but more than 100 women in the village also know how to read. This year's crops, due to the government's call for deep plowing and careful cultivation, are growing better. The sorghum is more than ten feet tall, and the soybeans are as tall as a person's waist. Each qing can yield seven or eight shi. Now our family does not lack food or clothing, and our family is living a peaceful life. This is all because of your correct leadership. Chairman Mao: You are always thinking of the people, and you are even closer than our mother. I am determined to work hard and mobilize all the women in the village, who account for half of the population, to follow you and the Communist Party forever, and I am determined to do a good job in production and produce more grain to build our new China.

Hu Qingyun from Linjiang Village, Tenth District, Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, wrote to Chairman Mao as follows: Dear Chairman Mao:

Thanks to your correct leadership, we women who have been oppressed for thousands of years have finally been liberated. This really makes us women feel grateful to you from the bottom of our hearts! Looking back on the past, we women have always been bound by politics, economics, and culture, and we have never been able to enjoy the same treatment as men. In the past, no matter how many girls there were in a family, as long as there were no boys, they would be unhappy for the rest of their lives, always thinking that no matter how many girls there were, it didn't matter. This is a glimpse of the contempt for women. At the same time, in the past, men always looked down on women, thinking that women ate idle rice and could not work, so often some men abused women. Because women's rights have been improved today, we women are no longer despised by men. At the same time, due to the implementation of the new Marriage Law this year, our women's marriage issues have been given considerable protection, and our women are expressing their gratitude to you. We women must unite in the future and take practical actions to participate in production to strive for the rights that our women should have, and do our best to support our compatriots in Tibet and Taiwan so that they can be liberated as soon as possible.

Qiu Yuzhen from Hujun Township, Gaozuo District, Jianyang County, Yancheng Special District, Northern Jiangsu, wrote to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu: Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

You are the great benefactors of all the working people in China, especially the great benefactors of our working women. I used to live a life like a beast of burden, working hard for others for two years—and I couldn't read. Now I have turned myself around and can be independent. In 1947, I worked as a stretcher bearer for more than ten days in the LianShui battle. Later, when the Huaihai Campaign started in 1948, the Party at a higher level called for support to the front. At that time, I asked the township chief to participate, and I immediately united a class of civilian workers and brought two stretchers to the district for concentration. There were more than 600 civilian workers in the brigade, and I was the only woman. I was still afraid that the brigade headquarters would not want me. Later, the civilian workers elected me as the deputy squad leader. From the beginning of the departure, I carried things weighing seventy or eighty jin all the way. Because I worked hard as a civilian worker, I was later awarded a first-class merit and awarded a certificate of merit.

When I was studying at the Yancheng Cadre School, I also learned to read, and now I can take notes.

I plant seven mu of land myself, cultivate seven mu on behalf of others, and combine with households with cattle to exchange labor and help each other, totaling fourteen mu. I don't need hired labor and I also earn wages. Later, I was commended at the township cadre meeting in the district. Because of my hard work in supporting the front, production, hard study, and work, I was awarded the title of labor model. When the National Congress of Worker-Peasant-Soldier Labor Model Representatives was held, I was very excited because the county recommended me to participate in the selection in the sub-district. Although I was not selected this time, I will not give up my efforts. I am determined to continue to study hard, strive to make new contributions on the production front, and strive to come to Beijing to see Chairman Mao next time.

　　农村妇女上书感谢毛主席
    翻了身，当了农村劳动模范，都是和毛主席的英明领导分不开的。
    【本报讯】土地改革打垮了阻碍农村生产发展的封建势力，同时也解除了封建势力给予劳动人民思想上的枷锁，数千年来受压迫最深的广大农村妇女都翻了身，在社会和经济上都获得了平等地位，在思想上获得了自由解放。庆祝国庆节时，许多土改后农村中的翻身妇女，写信给毛主席，庆贺自己的获得解放并向毛主席敬致由衷的感谢。下面是一部分原信的摘要。
    松江省双城县第三区庆北村大吴家屯蒋秀琴给毛主席的信如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    我过去在旧社会里，是一个穷家的女孩子，家里很贫寒，自从在您的领导下，得到了解放，分到了土地和房屋、牲畜、生产工具，因此我们的生活也逐渐的改善了，有吃也有穿，我是一个穷家的女孩子，今天也光荣的成为共产党员，和全县特等劳动模范。
    这些都是由于您的领导和教育，是您给予我的恩惠，我万分的感谢您。
    今年的年景是丰收年，庄稼长得又粗又壮，在今年的秋收里我一定发挥劳模应起的作用，把男女老少尤其是妇女发动起来，一齐动手，作好秋收工作。
    松江省双城县第六区太平村杜秀兰给毛主席的信：亲爱的毛主席：
    我们妇女过去受了帝国主义及封建势力的压迫，在那时我心中真是苦闷，自己心想为什么我们妇女遭受这样的不平等待遇？为什么，给有钱的人当奴隶，得不到自由的生活呢？自从八一五以后，八路军解放东北，人民得到了翻身，妇女得到了自由，不受男人的压迫，在社会上也有了妇女地位，我心中的苦闷才消除了。
    我男人在一九四八年参加独立七团工作，从他走后，家中有我及一个小孩两口人过日子，有区村政府的照顾，及由我自己劳动过活。一九四九年我参加了妇女会工作，领导妇女换工组和群众的联系很密切。今年一月我光荣地参加了中国共产党，从此以后，对工作更积极负责。二月在县开劳模大会我被选为乙等劳模，同时我下了决心提高妇女的政治觉悟，密切联系群众，给群众作个好榜样，完成党给我的任务。
    松江省双城县胡秀兰给毛主席的信中说：敬爱的毛主席：
    过去被压迫当牛马、被剥削得活不下去、被侮辱被蹂躏，我国广大农村妇女，今天，都已从匪徒的魔掌下解放了出来。我也是其中的一个，我在过去房无一间，地无一垅，一家六、七口人吃这顿少那顿，时常是一天连一顿饭也吃不上，向地主租一点地还得先说许多好话哀求，给人家扛活一年连二斗米也剩不上，一家老少常为没有下锅米而哭泣，因为我少吃无穿，怕人家笑，连大街也不敢出去。成日成夜劳动，旧社会根本就没拿我们穷人当人看待。
    我在翻身以后分了六垧地、三间房子。但国民党又来打解放区，为了保护斗争果实，我就动员我丈夫参军，我在家也领导妇女参加斗争。一九四八年我光荣地参加了中国共产党。妇女在旧社会根本没有半点地位，现在也能掌握政权啦。去年我被选为村政府委员，因为我辛勤劳动还当上了县的乙等模范，过去我一个字也不识，现在我也认识字了，并能写信了。不但我认识字，全村有一百多妇女也都认识了字。今年的庄稼，由于政府号召深耕细作，长的更好，高粱一丈多高，黄豆长的都齐人的腰，每垧能打七八石，现在我们家不缺吃，不缺穿，一家过着安然的日子，这都是因为有了你的正确领导。毛主席：你处处为人民着想，真比我们的妈妈还亲，我坚决努力工作，一定把全村占人口半数的妇女发动起来，永远跟着你和共产党走，决心搞好生产，多打粮来建设咱们的新中国。
    松江省双城县第十区林江村胡青云给毛主席的信如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    由于您的正确领导，我们遭受压迫数千年的妇女，今天才得到了解放。这真使我们妇女们对您由衷地感谢！回想过去我们妇女在政治上、经济上、文化上历来是受束缚的，总不能和男人一样的享受同等待遇。过去不论有多少女孩子的人，只要没有男孩子，那就一生不高兴，总认为女孩子有多少也不当事。这是轻视妇女的一斑。同时，在过去，男子总看不起妇女，以为妇女吃闲饭、不能劳动，所以往往有的男人对妇女实行虐待。由于今天提高了女权，我们妇女才不受男人的轻视了。同时由于今年的新婚姻法的实施，对我们妇女的婚姻问题，更有了相当的保障，我们妇女都在对您表示感激。我们妇女今后一定要团结起来，以参加生产的实际行动来争取掌握我们妇女应有的权利，并尽我们的力量支援西藏和台湾的同胞们，早日得到解放。
    苏北盐城专区建阳县高作区湖军乡邱玉珍给毛主席和朱总司令的信中称：毛主席、朱总司令：
    你们是我们全中国劳苦人民的大恩人，尤其是我们劳苦妇女的大恩人。我在以前过着牛马生活，替人家做了二年苦工——又不识字，现在我已翻身了，能独立自主了。我在一九四七年，在涟水战斗中做了十几天担架员，后在一九四八年淮海战役开始时，上级党号召支前，当时我就向乡长要求要去参加，随即自己团结了一个班的民工，带了两付担架床子，到区集中。大队有六百多民工就是我一个女的，心里还怕大队部不要，后经民工选我当了副班长。从出发起一路行军我都挑着七、八十斤重的东西。因为我做民工工作努力，后来评我一等功臣，荣获奖状一张。
    在盐阜干校学习时，我又学习识字，现在已能写笔记了。
    我自己种七亩田，代耕七亩，与有牛户结合换工、互助，计十四亩，不叫帮工还赚工资。后来又在全区乡干部会议上受到表扬。由于我努力支前生产、努力学习工作，荣获了劳模称号。在这次全国召开工农兵劳模代表会议时，因全县推选我到分区参加评选，我非常兴奋。这次我虽然未评得上，但我毫不放弃努力，我决心继续努力学习，争取在生产战线上再度立功，争取下一次来北京见毛主席。
