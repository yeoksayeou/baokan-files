Xinhua News Agency, October 18th: The Central People's Government Administrative Council's directive on launching an autumn vaccination campaign is as follows:

    In cities and villages throughout the country, smallpox occurs in all seasons, with wider epidemics occurring in winter and early spring, causing significant loss of life and property for the people. According to extremely incomplete statistics from this year, from January to August, there have been 44,211 smallpox cases and 7,765 deaths; the actual numbers are undoubtedly much higher. Although smallpox is highly contagious and has no specific treatment, it is a relatively easy disease to prevent. By universally vaccinating with cowpox, it can be completely eradicated. Therefore, at the beginning of the establishment of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, this disease was listed as one that must be eliminated within a set period. In the past eight months of this year, according to statistics reported by various regions, 40 million people have been vaccinated nationwide, accounting for approximately one-twelfth of the country's population. In many areas, such as Dalian and Lushun, thanks to the importance attached to it by local administrative and health authorities and the adoption of the mass line, the number of people vaccinated accounted for more than 80 percent of the entire population, and there have been no cases of smallpox this year. In areas such as Tong County in Hebei Province, local Chinese and Western medicine practitioners were mobilized, and primary school teachers, women cadres, and cultural and educational workers were trained to carry out the vaccination campaign, which quickly curbed the occurrence of smallpox. If all regions across the country can learn from these experiences and universally vaccinate, smallpox can be basically eliminated nationwide in a few years.

    In order to prevent the spread of smallpox this winter and next spring, we must launch a vaccination campaign this autumn to avoid repeating the mistakes of previous years, where vaccination campaigns were only launched after smallpox had already become epidemic in the spring. It is hereby decided:

    (1) People's governments at all levels should attach importance to this autumn's vaccination campaign. Those with health administrative organs can entrust the health administrative organs to organize it. Those without health administrative organs should organize local Chinese and Western medical groups (such as medical federations), cultural and educational worker groups, and women's groups to handle it through the civil administration organs and cultural and educational organs. Administrative organs at all levels should lead, supervise, and inspect from above, and summarize after the event, reporting level by level to the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government before the end of December of this year.

    (2) Greater administrative regions and provincial-level health administrative organs must carry out possible work according to different situations, such as organizing local Chinese and Western medicine practitioners to jointly carry out the vaccination campaign; or calling on cultural and educational workers to receive short-term vaccination skills training, distributing them to various counties, penetrating into rural areas, and in turn training rural cultural and educational workers and women cadres.

    (3) Areas where more vaccinations were carried out this spring (such as North China and Northeast China) should still carry out supplementary vaccinations to achieve the goal of universality. Vaccination should focus on infants and adults who have never been vaccinated or have not been re-vaccinated for more than five years, especially women. Areas where the vaccination campaign has not been well-developed must pay more attention to promoting it. Reaction checks should be carried out promptly after vaccination. When manpower is insufficient, key random checks can be carried out, and the number of people vaccinated should be counted.

    (4) Vaccination should be completely free of charge, and no fees should be charged to those vaccinated. The costs of vaccine, labor, and sanitary materials should be borne by governments at all levels.

    (5) Autumn vaccination does not conform to the customs and habits of the masses, so attention must be paid to publicity and education, patient persuasion, detailed explanation of the importance of autumn vaccination, and breaking those unscientific habits of not vaccinating except in the spring, not vaccinating unless the peach blossoms are in bloom, not vaccinating unless the wheat is heading, and even some that require choosing a day and divination before vaccinating, so that the masses consciously and willingly accept vaccination.

　　中央人民政府政务院
    指示各地发动秋季种痘运动
    减少人民生命财产重大损失
    【新华社十八日讯】中央人民政府政务院关于发动秋季种痘运动的指示，全文如下：
    全国各地城市及乡村，一年四季均有天花发生，每届冬季及春初流行较广，造成人民生命财产的损失至为重大。根据今年全国极不完整的统计，自一月至八月已有天花患者四四、二一一人，死亡七、七六五人，实际数字必远较此数为多。天花虽传染剧烈，并无特效疗法，但为一种较易预防的疾病，只要普种牛痘，便可彻底消灭。所以中央人民政府卫生部成立之初，即将此病列入必须在定期内消灭的疾病。今年八个月来，据各地业已报来的统计，全国已有四千万人种了牛痘，约占全国人口的十二分之一。有许多地区，例如旅大，由于地方行政及卫生机关的重视，并采取了群众路线，种痘人数占全人口百分之八十以上，今年便没有发生天花。河北省通县等地区发动了地方中西医，并训练小学教员、妇女干部、文教工作者，开展了种痘运动，也迅速遏止了天花的发生。如果全国各地都能吸收这些经验，普种牛痘，数年后必能在全国范围内基本的消灭天花。
    为了预防今冬及明春的天花流行，我们必需在今秋开展一次种痘运动，以免再犯往年的错误，即于春季天花已经流行之后才开始发动种痘。兹特决定：
    （一）各级人民政府对于今秋的种痘运动应加以重视，其有卫生行政机关者，可交由卫生行政机关主办，尚无卫生行政机关者，应由民政机关及文教机关组织地方中西医团体（如医联会）、文教工作者团体及妇女团体办理。各级行政机关应从上加以领导、督促和检查，并于事后总结，于本年十二月底以前逐级呈报中央人民政府卫生部。
    （二）大行政区及省级卫生行政机关，必须根据不同情况，进行可能的工作，如组织地方中西医共同进行种痘运动；或号召文教工作者施以短期种痘技术的训练，分发各县，深入农村，转而训练农村文教工作者及妇女干部。
    （三）今春种痘较多的地方（如华北、东北）仍应进行补种，以达到普遍的目的。各地种痘应着重婴儿及从未种痘或五年以上未曾复种的成人，特别是妇女。种痘运动尚未很好开展的地区，必须更加注意推动。接种后应及时检查反应，在人力不足时，可作重点抽查，并应统计接种的人数。
    （四）种痘应一律免费，不得向受种人收取任何费用。痘苗、人工、卫生材料等费，均应由各级政府负担。
    （五）秋季种痘与群众风俗习惯不合，所以必须注意宣教工作，耐心说服，详细解释秋季种痘的重要，打破那些非春天不种，桃花不开不种，麦子出穗不种，甚至有些必需择日算卦才种的不科学的习惯，使群众自觉自愿的接受种痘。
