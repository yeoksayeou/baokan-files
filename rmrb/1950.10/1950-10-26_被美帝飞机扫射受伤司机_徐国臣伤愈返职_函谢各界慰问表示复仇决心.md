　　Driver Xu Guochen, Wounded by U.S. Imperialist Aircraft Strafing, Returns to Work After Recovery
    Sends Letter Thanking All Sectors for Their Concern and Expressing Determination to Seek Revenge
    [This newspaper report] According to the Northeast Daily: Xu Guochen, the driver of locomotive "928" who was wounded by U.S. imperialist aircraft strafing at Linjiang Station on August 27th, has recovered. On October 6th, he returned to Linjiang from Tonghua Hospital, and on October 11th, he wrote a letter to the Northeast Daily to be forwarded to compatriots from all sectors of the country, thanking them for their concern and expressing his determination to seek revenge. The full text of the letter is as follows:
    (Salutation omitted) After I was wounded by U.S. aircraft strafing, I received the cordial and enthusiastic concern from compatriots from all sectors of the country, and the devoted treatment from medical personnel. I am now especially telling you: my injuries have healed, and I was discharged from the hospital on October 6th and returned to Linjiang. Please rest assured!
    I am particularly pleased that locomotive "928," which was damaged by U.S. aircraft strafing, has been revived after round-the-clock repairs by workers at the Tonghua Locomotive Depot. On October 1st, I participated in the revival ceremony of the locomotive at the Tonghua Locomotive Depot. Seeing the "928" locomotive, which was much better than before, with six passenger cars attached and many small red flags inserted, it looked even more splendid. I walked up to it and paid special attention to the damaged parts. I could hardly see them. It was much better than before the strafing, fully demonstrating the great strength of our workers. When the train, fully loaded with people attending the ceremony, started to parade towards "New Tonghua," I was especially happy to sit in the locomotive with the driver. On this day, I truly forgot the pain of my injury. After getting off the train, I rushed to participate in the Tonghua City National Day celebration rally. I was warmly received by the leaders and representatives from all sectors, and was elected to the presidium and spoke in front of the loudspeaker.
    On October 6th, I was discharged from the hospital and returned to Linjiang. When I got home, I saw that the fellow workers had already repaired the house, plastered the walls, and repaired the kang (heated brick bed). The coal for winter heating had been collected and delivered to my home, and there was also firewood. Fellow workers personally fetched water for me every day. The house was also filled with many gifts such as rice, flour, and sugar sent from all over the country, as well as more than 300 letters of condolences from all over the country. I don't know how to express my gratitude. Unable to reply to each letter individually, I hereby pay my respects to all compatriots from all sectors of the country, including workers, peasants, soldiers, and students!
    Compatriots from all sectors in Linjiang have long hoped that my injuries would heal soon and that I would return to work quickly. On the first day after I arrived in Linjiang, railway workers came to see me constantly. It was not until the second day that I started to visit various agencies and units to express my gratitude. As soon as I went out, there were workers, citizens, and merchants, both those I knew and those I didn't, who grabbed my right hand and said, "Comrade Xu Guochen, we have been looking forward to your recovery for a long time. Are you better now?" When I arrived at the match factory, the factory director led me to see the workers' enthusiastic production. The workers everywhere cheered me so warmly. Seeing that I was holding my left hand up, fearing that it would be harmed by hanging freely, they immediately scraped a wooden board and used a bandage to hang it up. When the Forestry Bureau workers heard that I had returned, the club was packed. There had never been so many people holding an evening party to invite me to speak, and they also led me to see the wall posters filled with forestry workers' determination to learn from Xu Guochen.
    Compatriots from all sectors: I am a Chinese worker. I have made up my mind that when my hand doesn't hurt, I will definitely return to my job and take practical actions to avenge myself. If I can't work as a driver, I can also do other railway work. I guarantee to actively engage in production, make more rationalization proposals, make more contributions to production, eliminate accidents, overcome winter transportation difficulties, complete tasks, support the People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan and Tibet as soon as possible, and strike at the aggression of U.S. imperialism!
                                Xu Guochen
                              October 11th

　　被美帝飞机扫射受伤司机
    徐国臣伤愈返职
    函谢各界慰问表示复仇决心
    【本报讯】据东北日报讯：八月二十七日在临江车站被美帝国主义飞机扫射受伤的“九二八”号机车司机徐国臣已经痊愈，十月六日由通化医院回至临江，并于十月十一日写信给东北日报转全国各界同胞，答谢各界关怀慰问，并表示复仇的决心。该信全文如下：
    （衔略）我被美机扫射受伤后，蒙全国各界同胞亲切热烈的慰问和关怀，和医务人员的加心治疗，现在特别告诉你们：我的伤已好了，并在十月六日出院回到临江啦，请你们放心吧！
    我特别高兴的是被美机扫射受损的“九二八”号机车经过通化机务段工友昼夜抢修已经复活了。十月一日我在通化机务段参加该机车复活典礼，眼见比以前好得多的九二八机车挂着六个客车，上插着很多小红旗，显得更精彩了。我走到它跟前特别注意看看伤处，真有些看不出来，比没被扫射时好多了，充分的显示出咱们工人的强大力量。当满载着参加典礼的人们往“新通化”开动游行的时候，我分外高兴的在机车里与司机坐在一起。这一天我真忘了伤还痛，下车就赶往参加通化市庆祝国庆大会，蒙首长和各界代表热烈招待，并被选为主席团，又在扩音机面前讲了话。
    十月六日这一天，我出院回到临江。到家一看，工友们早把房子给修理好了，墙墁了，炕也修理了，冬季防寒的煤都给领出来送到家里，柴火也有了，工友们亲自天天给挑水，屋里还摆着各地送来的大米、白面、糖等很多礼物，还有来自全国各地的三百多封慰问信，我不知怎样感激好了。不能一一的回信，谨在这里向全国工、农、兵、学等各界同胞致以敬礼！
    临江各界同胞早就盼望我的伤早些好，快回来工作。我到临江后第一天，铁路工友一天没断头的来看我。第二天才开始往各机关单位走一走，准备去致谢，一出门就有我认识的还有我不认识的工人、市民、商人，拉着我的右手说：“徐国臣同志我们盼望你好久了，现在伤可好了吧？”当我到火柴厂时，厂长领我去看工友们积极生产的情况，到处工友都那么亲热的欢呼我。他们看见我的左手提着，怕空坏了，便马上刮了个木板用绷带给吊起来。林务局工友听说我回来了，俱乐部里挤满了，从来未有过的那么多的人开晚会请我给讲话，还领我去看墙上满贴的林业工人们写的决心学习徐国臣的壁报。
    各界同胞们：我是中国的工人，我下定了决心，手不痛了一定回到工作岗位上，用实际行动来报仇雪恨，不能作开车工作，也能作其他铁路上的工作，保证积极生产，多提合理化建议，多在生产上立功，消灭事故，克服冬季运输困难，完成任务，支援解放大军早日解放台湾、西藏，打击美帝国主义的侵略！
                               徐国臣
                              十月十一日
