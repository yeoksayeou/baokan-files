In Mourning of Comrade Ren Bishi
    Xi Zhongxun

Comrade Ren Bishi, one of the most outstanding leaders of our Party, passed away in Beijing at 12:36 on the 27th of this month. Hearing this unfortunate news, every one of us felt extremely grieved.

    Comrade Bishi directly led the work of the Northwest Party since 1940. In 1943, under the kind leadership of Comrade Bishi, the High-Level Cadre Meeting of the Border Region, which had significant historical importance, was held. This meeting not only resolved the historical issues of the Northwest Party, but most importantly, it also resolved the issue of how to build base areas, which needed to be addressed nationwide at that time. He said: "The basic tasks after we seize political power, besides maintaining this political power and preventing it from being invaded by the enemy, are to organize the economic and cultural life of the people, especially the economic life." He earnestly advised us to firmly grasp economic construction as the central link and carry out all kinds of work around this central link. Only in this way could we have the Great Production Movement and various construction works after 1943, making the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region a model anti-Japanese democratic base area.

    Comrade Bishi attached great importance to correcting and implementing the Party's policies. Whether it was the Three-Thirds System political power policy, the public grain burden policy, the policy of running cooperatives, etc., he always closely monitored the actual implementation, promptly guided us to correct deviations, and made new regulations to adapt to the development of the situation. He truly understood what Chairman Mao said, "Policy is the lifeline of our Party." Especially in the winter of 1947, he specifically studied the land reform movement in the Jin-Sui and Northern Shaanxi regions in Yangjiagou, Mizhi, and made the report "Several Issues in Land Reform," which played a significant role in correcting the "leftist" deviations in land reform in various places.

    Comrade Bishi's leadership work was full of principle and practicality. He was very serious and meticulous about principled issues of direction, policy, and ideology. When guiding practical work, he was also good at delving into every detail to gain a thorough and accurate understanding of the actual situation. At meetings, he often asked comrades who talked about work issues: "Please be more specific!" He personally talked to rural cadres leading salt transportation, collected and sorted out materials, and solved the problem of how to organize the masses near Yan'an to transport salt to Sanbian to obtain profits. There are really many, many similar things like this.

    Comrade Bishi has passed away, and he has bid farewell to us forever! But his long-term and kind guidance on the work of the Northwest Party is something we will always remember. His example as a model communist fighter will always live in our hearts. We mourn Comrade Bishi! We will always remember him and learn from him. We have specially published a section of Comrade Bishi's speech at the High-Level Cadre Meeting of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Party in January 1943 on "Leadership Work and Work Style Issues." What he taught us at that time is still very fresh for our work today. All of us comrades must study hard. We must turn grief into strength, learn from Comrade Bishi's ability to grasp the central link in work, learn from his emphasis on correcting and implementing the Party's policies, learn from his style full of principle and practicality, and more quickly improve ourselves. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we will do a good job in the Northwest and a good job in China. We will mourn Comrade Bishi with such practical actions.

　　悼任弼时同志
    习仲勋
    我党最卓越的领导人之一任弼时同志，于本月二十七日十二时三十六分在北京逝世了。听到这个不幸的消息，我们每个同志，都感到万分的悲恸。
    弼时同志，从一九四○年以来，就直接领导西北党的工作。一九四三年，在弼时同志亲切领导下，开了有重大历史意义的边区高干会议。这个会议，不仅解决了西北党的历史问题，最重要的，还解决了当时在全国范围内都需要加以解决的，如何建设根据地的问题。他说：“在我们掌握政权之后的基本任务，除开保持这一政权，使之不受敌人侵袭以外，就是组织人民的经济生活和文化生活，特别重要的是经济生活。”他谆谆告诫我们必须紧紧抓住经济建设这个中心环节，围绕这个中心环节，进行各种工作。这样，才有了一九四三年以后的大生产运动和各项建设工作。使陕甘宁边区成为模范的抗日民主根据地。
    弼时同志十分重视端正和贯彻党的政策。无论是对三三制政权政策，公粮负担政策，办合作社的政策等等，他都是经常密切注视实际执行的状况，及时地指导我们纠正偏向，和作出新的适应发展情况的规定。他是真正体会了毛主席所说的“政策是我们党的生命线”。特别是一九四七年冬，他在米脂杨家沟具体研究了晋绥和陕北地区的土地改革运动，作了《土地改革中的几个问题》的报告，对纠正各地土地改革中的“左”的偏向，起了很大的作用。
    弼时同志在领导工作中，充满原则性和实际精神。他对于方针、政策性和思想性的原则问题，是十分严肃，一丝不苟。他在指导实际工作时，又善于深入到每一细节中去，求得对于实际情况，获得透彻的、准确的了解。他在会议上，常常要求谈工作问题的同志：“请说得具体些！”他曾亲自找领导运盐的乡村干部谈话，搜集、整理材料，解决如何组织延安附近群众，去三边运盐，能获得利润的问题。这样类似的事情，实在是很多很多的。
    弼时同志逝世了，他和我们永别了！但他对西北党的工作长期亲切的指导，是我们永远怀念的。他那模范的共产主义战士的榜样，将永远活在我们的心里。我们恸悼弼时同志！我们永远怀念他，学习他。我们特别发表了弼时同志在一九四三年一月陕甘宁边区党高干会上讲话的一段“关于领导工作和工作作风问题”。他在那时教导我们的话，对于我们今天的工作，仍然都是很新鲜的。我们全体同志，都要好好学习。我们要将悲恸化为力量，要学习弼时同志那样善于抓紧工作中的中心环节，学习他那样重视端正和贯彻党的政策，学习他那样充满原则性和实际精神的作风，更迅速地提高自己，在党中央和毛主席领导下，把西北的事情办好，把全中国的事情办好。用这样的实际行动，来悼念弼时同志。
