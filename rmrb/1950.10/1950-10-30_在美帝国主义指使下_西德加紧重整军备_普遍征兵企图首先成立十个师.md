　　Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Since the New York meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France decided to fully remilitarize West Germany, the work of West German rearmament is being accelerated. According to a report by the Electrical Communication Agency citing a Leipzig broadcast on the 25th, the West German puppet government, under the direction of U.S. imperialism, is planning universal conscription to first establish ten army divisions with more than 200,000 soldiers, including tank units, engineers, and motorized infantry. News from Bonn reveals that Adenauer's military technical advisor, former Nazi General Schwerin, is drafting specific plans according to American instructions. Berlin newspapers also reported that West Germany has a plan to establish an air force commanded by the United States. The so-called "Aeronautical Sports Association" has been established in Dortmund, in the British occupation zone, as the foundation for an air force officer corps.

　　A German News Agency report from Bonn stated that the Bonn "government," under the orders of the U.S. and British occupying authorities, must spend 920 million marks before March 30, 1951, as the first batch of appropriations to restore some dismantled war industries. The Bonn "government's" Ministry of Finance has been ordered to guarantee this appropriation by increasing public debt and taxes. The Riepe factory in Tutoleum, in the British occupation zone, has been ordered by the occupying authorities to resume aircraft production by the end of the year.

　　Prior to this, the "Steintel" mirror factory in Munich, in the U.S. occupation zone; the "Worte" machine factory in Nuengamme; ball bearing factories in Stuttgart in the British occupation zone and Scharzfeld in the French occupation zone; the Alache steel armor factory; and the "Concordia" foundry in Koblenz, have all been producing various weapons or parts for weapons. The second factory of the Krupp Panther tank manufacturing plant has completed preparations to resume Panther tank production.

    【新华社二十八日讯】在美、英、法三国外长纽约会议决定全力使西德重新军事化以来，西德重整军备的工作正加紧进行。据电通社引莱比锡二十五日广播消息，西德傀儡政府在美帝国主义指使之下，正计划普遍征兵，首先成立十个师军队，兵员将超过二十万人，包括坦克部队、工兵和摩托化步兵。波恩的消息透露，阿登纳的军事技术顾问、前纳粹将军许威林，正在按美国指示草拟具体计划。柏林报纸并报道西德已有成立由美国指挥的空军的计划。英占区多特蒙德已成立所谓“航空体育协会”，作为空军军官队的基础。
    德意志通讯社波恩消息报道，波恩“政府”奉美英占领当局的命令，须在一九五一年三月三十日前支出九亿二千万马克，作为恢复一些已被拆卸的战争工业的第一批拨款。波恩“政府”财政部已奉命以增加公债和税收保证这笔拨款。英占区佗油地方的里卑工厂，已奉占领当局命令必须在年底以前恢复飞机生产。
    在此以前，美占区慕尼黑的“斯泰因特尔”制镜工厂，努恩加梅的“窝尔忒”机器工厂；英占区斯图加特和法占区沙尔兹科泼夫两地的球轴承工厂；阿拉黑钢甲工厂，科不林大的“康科迪亚”翻砂工厂等，均已在生产各种武器或武器用的零件。克虏伯豹型坦克制造厂第二厂，已完成恢复豹型坦克生产的准备工作。
