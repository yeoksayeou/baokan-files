Xinhua News Agency, 1st. German Democratic Republic Foreign Minister Dertinger sent a telegram to our Foreign Minister Zhou congratulating our nation on its National Day. The original telegram is as follows:

To Mr. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China:

    On this occasion of the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, please accept my sincere congratulations to you and the entire Chinese people. The progressive and democratic forces of the German people, who are struggling hard for the unification of Germany, are watching with great sympathy and concern the ever-increasing achievements of the Chinese people in establishing a new social order. They are convinced that the establishment of the People's Republic of China and its joining the great world peace camp led by the Soviet Union and Marshal Stalin will make this camp invincible. In this sense, I believe that the strengthening and deepening of friendship between the Chinese and German peoples is a contribution to defending peace and opposing the instigators of new wars. I wish you and the Chinese people further great achievements in peaceful construction.

Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Dertinger (signed)

　　德国外长窦丁格尔贺电
    【新华社一日讯】德意志民主共和国外交部长窦丁格尔致电我国周外长祝贺我国国庆，原电如下：中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部长周恩来先生：
    当此中华人民共和国建国一周年之际，谨向您与全体中国人民表示我的衷心祝贺。在为德国的统一而艰苦奋斗的德国人民之进步民主力量，正以巨大的同情和关切注视着中国人民在其建立新的社会秩序中之与日俱增的成就，他们确信：中华人民共和国的成立及其加入以苏联及斯大林大元帅为领导的伟大世界和平阵营，将使这个阵营成为不可战胜。在这个意义上，我认为：中国与德国人民间友谊的加强与加深是对保卫和平、反对新战争煽动者的一个贡献。祝您与中国人民在和平建设工作中进一步的伟大成就。
