    Expresses Condolences on the Death of Comrade Ren Bishi
    [Xinhua News Agency, 29th] Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling sent a cable to the CPC Central Committee, expressing condolences on the death of Comrade Ren Bishi. The cable reads as follows: To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and to the family of Comrade Ren Bishi:
    I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Comrade Ren Bishi on the 27th. Comrade Ren dedicated himself to the revolution and worked for the oppressed people of China and the world for a long time. It is a great loss that he succumbed to overwork and illness before he could personally witness the construction of the new China. I hope you will turn your grief into strength, continue Comrade Ren's great revolutionary spirit, and strive for lasting world peace and to stop the US imperialists from expanding their war of aggression.
                                          Soong Ching Ling, October 28th
