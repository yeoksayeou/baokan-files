　　A Village in the Old Liberated Area
　　Yao Fu

　　A small canal of clear water flows quietly through the heart of the street. Young women and peasant women sit by the canal washing clothes and vegetables. Restoration work is underway on the ruins of the foundations of houses burned by the Japanese invaders. Some grey-black walls have been covered with new roofs, and some large foundations have been temporarily reduced to one or half a thatched shed. Tiangang Village in Yixian County, an old liberated area in North China, is, like all the tested liberated area villages, resolutely and confidently arranging its new life. However, from its appearance, one can still find the serious wounds of war and famine. To the east of the village, the cultivated land is still silted with four or five feet of fine sand, there are still many broken bricks and tiles beside the street, and there are pitifully few trees in the village; through these superficial phenomena, I see many new things growing and changing.

　　Under the bright moonlight, the farmers of Tiangang spent this year's "Mid-Autumn Festival" celebrating the harvest. Gray-haired old men, adults and young people talked to me about this year's harvest. The main crop in Tiangang is corn, which every household grows. This year's "corncobs" are very large. Production Committee member Yu Louchi said: "We can harvest at least 70 to 80 percent." They said that this year's harvest was not easy to come by, and it was the result of a serious struggle against natural disasters. After the wheat harvest, the corn seedlings grew rapidly. The farmers generally applied "topdressing" fertilizer, and with sufficient moisture, the leaves were dark green, plump, and very lovely. On the ninth day of the sixth lunar month, a dark cloud brought strong wind and rain, which lasted for three hours. Tree branches were broken, thatched roofs were blown off, and all the corn lay on the ground, flat, as if swept over by a river. The farmers walked from the east of the village to the west, each one showing an anxious expression. However, the natural disaster did not frighten these tested farmers. The new middle peasant Hao Luohui and his brother, who had just been discharged from the army, discussed it and decided to "prop up the fallen ones" based on their experience in fighting the wind disaster last year. That afternoon, a family of four propped up one mu of corn. In the evening, the village production committee made a resolution: to promote this method to the whole village. The Youth League immediately went to the hilltop to broadcast, shouting the slogan "Prop up one, save one, oppose pessimism and despair" to all men, women, old and young in the village. The next morning, the labor army was distributed in the fields to the east, west, and south of the village. Regardless of gender or age, they propped them up and piled them up, surrounding each corn root with soil. Farmers, both men and women, propped them up from morning to noon, from noon to dark, and some did not even go home to eat. The mother of army member Li Liquan and her daughter-in-law propped up all one and a half mu of their corn, and both of them were practically covered in mud. The corn of Hao Luozhi's family, which lacked labor, was propped up by his daughter and granddaughter. The whole village fought for a full day and a half, and the great task was accomplished. People said: "It is up to people to make things happen. Relying on heaven for food is unreliable."

　　Farmers understand that to increase production, they must improve technology. Science and technology are being gradually promoted in Tiangang. This year, Tiangang began to promote "foreign yams." "Foreign yams" can yield more than 4,000 jin per mu, four times more than the old varieties. People generally practice field selection of seeds, selecting wheat seeds ear by ear during the wheat harvest. Farmers used new methods to control aphids. The Youth League planted two pots of wheat, one with soaked seeds and one without, preparing for the masses to visit and promoting universal seed soaking. In any home, you can see selected grain seeds, bean seeds, and corn seeds hanging under the eaves and on the large rafters. The masses' conscious seed selection work has been difficult to achieve for many years.

　　Not long ago, Tiangang Village elected labor models to attend the labor model conference in the county. Army member Ma was honorably elected as the first place. After her son joined the army, she worked especially hard. She gets up at midnight every day to collect manure, and can collect two or three baskets every day. With the help of the village, she did not plant a single mu of "bai zha" land, and her life has improved compared to before. Some people said, "She collected all the manure in the village by herself." In fact, this is an exaggeration. This year's manure accumulation work in Tiangang has exceeded the results of the past decade. In the spring, farmers generally dismantled the earthen beds. Every household raised pigs to produce fertilizer. After the summer "hanging hoe," the work of pressing green manure formed a craze. Under the leadership of village chief Hao Luoyin, more than 30 people drove livestock every day to cut artemisia. Some competed for the size of the loads, and some competed for the weight of the packs. The farmers proposed to guarantee that the army members would apply 30 loads of manure to dry land and 60 loads of manure to paddy fields. The village production committee provided them with 500 jin to 2,500 jin of green artemisia respectively, depending on the army members' labor situation. This plan was overfulfilled.

　　This year's Spring Festival, Tiangang Village declined the requests of other villages to participate in the festivities. Under the call of the CCP branch, a canal committee was established, mobilizing all men, women, old and young in the village, and spent 18 days digging a new five-li long canal. This ideal, which had been brewing for many years but could not be realized, was realized this year. The new canal freed up a lot of irrigation labor, saved the expense of making and buying irrigation tools, and ensured that crops were planted on time. After harvesting the grain in the autumn, the CCP branch again suggested to the village representatives' meeting to use the gap time before the corn was ripe to repair the canal once again. Under the leadership of village chief Hao Luoyin, everyone raced to be the first, carrying many large stones from the river beach half a li away, building a five-foot high and sixty-foot long embankment that had been washed away in the summer, and repairing the dam entrance. The clear water in the canal began to irrigate autumn cabbage, and wheat planting was guaranteed. Favorable conditions for next year's production were prepared this year.

　　People are particularly interested in the village representatives' meeting. When the village representatives' meeting was established this year, a district cadre came to Tiangang to help with the election, and everyone was very serious. One group's candidate was defeated, and the district cadre was a little anxious, worried about whether the elected person was really good. The farmers said: "The people we elect are the ones we trust. Otherwise, why would we elect them?" Over the past year, the issuance of land certificates, land evaluation, wheat harvesting, canal repair, and mountain closure have been successfully completed through the representatives' meeting. The People's Congress has a very high prestige. Every village representative pays great attention to the unity of the village. They often mediate disputes between farmers and solve problems for farmers.

　　While working hard to produce, the farmers of Tiangang are also trying to improve their culture. They are beginning to pay attention to sending their children to school. Young women are insisting on attending people's schools. These old area farmers are very concerned about national and international affairs. Before the autumn harvest, all the farmers in Tiangang Village signed the peace signature movement. The Youth League constantly uses the "three heads" opportunities (field head, street head, kang head) to publicize current events to the masses. CCP branch secretary Hao Chunhe is a soldier who has just been discharged from the army. He has been injured three times. He said at a mass meeting of the whole village: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, we have won the victory of the war. We are now healing our wounds. We must defend the peaceful life we have earned with our blood and sweat."

　　Tiangang has become one of the model villages in the fourth district of Yixian County, Hebei Province.

　　老解放区一农村
    药夫
    一条流着清水的小渠，静静地穿过街心。青年的姑娘和农妇们坐在渠边洗衣、洗菜。在日寇烧毁的房基废墟上，进行着恢复工程。有些灰黑的墙壁上盖了新的屋顶，有些大的房基上临时缩修成一间或半间草棚。华北老解放区的易县田岗村，正像所有久经考验的解放区农村一样，坚毅而有信心地安排自己的新生活。但是，如从它的外观看去，还会发现严重的战争与灾荒的创伤。村东边耕地上仍淤着四、五尺厚的细沙，大街旁边还有许多破砖碎瓦，村内树木还少得可怜；透过这些表面的现象，我看到许多新的事物，在生长，在变化。
    在皎洁的月光下，田岗的农民们度过今年丰收的“中秋节”。白发苍苍的老人、壮年和青年对我谈论今年的年景。田岗主要的农作物是玉蜀黍，家家户户都种。今年的“棒子”十分粗大，生产委员于洛致说：“足足能收到七八成”。他们说，这个年景是不容易得来的，这是与天灾作严重斗争的结果。麦收之后，玉蜀黍幼苗飞快地成长着，农民们普遍上了“追肥”，加以水分充足，叶子深绿肥大，十分可爱。阴历六月初九，一片乌云带来粗风暴雨，一连打了三个钟头，树枝刮断了，草房顶被掀掉了，所有的玉蜀黍都躺在地上，平平的，像河水冲过一样。农民们从村东走到村西，每一个人都显出焦急的面容。但是，天灾并没有吓倒这些久经考验的农民，新中农郝洛辉和他刚退伍的弟弟商量一番，决定根据去年和风灾作斗争的经验，“把躺倒的扶起来”。当天下午，一家四口扶起一亩玉蜀黍。晚上，村生产委员会作了决议：向全村推广这个办法。青年团立即到山头广播，向全村男女老幼喊出“扶一棵，活一棵，反对悲观失望”的口号。第二天清早，劳动大军分布在村东、村西、村南的地里，不分男女老少，扶的扶，堆的堆，每一棵玉蜀黍根上都围了泥土。农夫和农妇们，从早晨扶到中午，从中午扶到天黑，有的就不回家吃饭。军属于立泉的母亲和她儿媳把自己一亩半玉蜀黍全部扶完了，两个人简直变成了泥人。缺乏劳动力的郝洛芝家的玉蜀黍，是靠姑娘和孙女扶起来的。全村整整战斗了一天半，大功告成了。人们说：“事在人为，靠天吃饭是靠不住的。”
    农民们懂得要想增加生产，必须改进技术。科学技术正在田岗逐步推广。今年田岗开始推广“洋山药”，“洋山药”每亩可收四千余斤，比旧品种多收四倍。人们普遍实行田间选种，麦收时，一穗一穗地选了麦种。农民们运用了新方法防治蚜虫。青年团种上浸种和不浸种的两盆小麦、准备让群众参观，提倡普遍浸种。随便到一家，都可看到房檐下、大椽上挂着选好的谷种、豆种和玉蜀黍种。群众自觉地选种工作，是多年来很难办到的。
    不久以前，田岗村选举了劳动模范，准备到县里去开劳模大会。军属于马氏光荣地选为第一名。儿子参军之后，她劳动特别积极。天天半夜便起床拾粪，每天能拾两三筐。再加上村里的帮助，没有种一亩“白楂”地，生活比以前改善了。有人说：“全村的粪就让她一个人拾了”。其实，这是夸大的说法。田岗今年的积肥工作，超过了近十年来的成果。春天，农民们普遍拆了土炕。家家养猪造肥。夏季“挂锄”之后，压绿肥的工作形成热潮。在村长郝洛印带头之下，天天有三十多人赶着牲口打蒿，有的比担子大小，有的比驮子轻重。农民们提出保证军属旱地上粪三十驮，水地上粪六十驮，村生产委员会根据军属劳力情况，分别给他们补助了五百斤到二千五百斤青蒿，这个计划超额完成了。
    今年春节，田岗村谢绝了外村闹玩艺的要求，在中共支部号召下，成立了水渠委员会，动员全村男女老幼，用了十八天工夫，开出一道五里长的新水渠。这个酝酿多年而不得实现的理想，今年实现了。新水渠腾出许多浇地人工，节约了制买浇地家具的开支，保证了农作物按时下种。在秋季割谷之后，中共支部又向村代表会建议，利用玉蜀黍还未成熟的空隙时间，又补修了一次水渠。在村长郝洛印带动下，人人争先恐后，从往返半里路的河滩上，搬了许多大石头，筑起夏季冲毁的五尺高、六十尺长的堤墙，并修好坝口。渠内的清水开始灌溉秋白菜，小麦下种有了保证，明年生产的有利条件，今年就准备好了。
    人们对于村代表会感到特别的兴趣。今年成立村代表会时，一个区干部到田岗帮助选举，大家都很认真。有一个组的竞选代表落选了，区干部有些急躁，担心当选的人是否真好。农民们说：“我们选举的人是我们信任的，不然，要我们选举干什么？”一年来通过代表会顺利的完成了颁发土地证、土地评产、麦收、修渠、禁山等工作。人代会已具有很高的威信。每一个村代表都十分注意村中的团结，他们经常调解农民之间的纠纷，替农民解决问题。
    田岗的农民一面勤劳生产，一面设法提高文化。他们开始注意让自己的孩子上学。青年姑娘们坚持着上民校。这些老区的农民十分关心国家大事和国际大事，在秋收以前，在和平签名运动中，田岗村全村农民都签了名，青年团不断利用“三头”机会（地头、街头、炕头），向群众宣传时事。中共支部书记郝春和是刚退伍不久的军人，他曾负过三次伤，他在全村群众大会上说：“我们在共产党与人民政府领导下，得到了战争的胜利。我们现在正医治自己的创伤，我们要保卫用血汗换来的和平生活。”
    田岗已成了河北省易县四区模范村之一。
