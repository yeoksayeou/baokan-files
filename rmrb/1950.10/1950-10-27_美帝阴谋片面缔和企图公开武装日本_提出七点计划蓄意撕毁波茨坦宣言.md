Xinhua News Agency, October 26th: American imperialism is conspiring to continue its long-term occupation of Japan through a unilateral peace treaty, and to openly arm it to serve as its tool of aggression. According to an Associated Press report from Lake Success on the 21st, the United States, in informal negotiations with other countries of the Far Eastern Commission regarding a peace treaty with Japan, has put forward a seven-point peace plan proposed by the United States. The US plan overturns the Potsdam Declaration's provision that the Council of Foreign Ministers is responsible for preparing peace treaties for defeated countries, and cancels the principle of great power unanimity. The first point of the US plan is that "this treaty can be signed by any country that has fought Japan in the past." Regarding territorial issues, the US plan states: "Japan should recognize the US trusteeship of the Ogasawara Islands and the Ryukyu Islands and the independence of Korea. The status of Taiwan and the Kuril Islands should be decided by the United Nations General Assembly if the major powers cannot reach an agreement within one year." According to international agreements such as the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Yalta Agreement, Taiwan and the Kuril Islands should be returned to China and the Soviet Union respectively; there is no so-called status issue at all. The Ogasawara and Ryukyu Islands should be jointly decided by the major powers. Regarding US military bases in Japan, the United States, using the excuse of "ensuring the security of Japan" in its plan, openly proposed that "the Japanese should provide certain bases for use by the US military."
Regarding the issue of reparations, the US plan states: "All belligerent countries should waive claims for compensation from Japan for losses caused before September 2, 1945 (i.e., the date of Japan's signing of surrender), but Japanese assets that have already been confiscated can be used to offset war reparations." This shows that the United States is attempting to legitimize its unilateral decision in May 1949 to stop Japanese reparations, and to retain Japan's war industry through this.
According to a Dentsu report from London on the 20th, the US-proposed draft treaty stipulates that Japan should have an army of 700,000 men, 500,000 tons of various warships, and 1,000 aircraft. This is to restore Japan's aggressive military strength as a tool of the United States for war.

　　美帝阴谋片面缔和企图公开武装日本
    提出七点计划蓄意撕毁波茨坦宣言
    【新华社二十六日讯】美国正阴谋通过片面的对日和约，继续长期占领日本，并公开加以武装，充当其侵略工具。据美联社成功湖二十一日讯：美国在与远东委员会其他国家关于对日和约的非正式的谈判中，提出了美国所拟议的七点和约计划。美国的计划推翻波茨坦宣言关于由外长会议负责准备对战败国家和约的规定，取消大国一致的原则。美国计划的第一点即为“这个和约可以由任何过去对日作战的国家签订”。关于领土问题，美国的计划是：“日本应承认美国托管小笠原群岛和琉球群岛及朝鲜的独立。台湾和千岛群岛的地位，如大国在一年之内不能获致协议，应待联合国大会决定。”而根据开罗宣言、波茨坦公告及雅尔达协定等国际协议的规定，台湾和千岛群岛应分别归还中国和苏联，根本没有所谓地位问题。小笠原及琉球两群岛则应由各大国共同决定。关于美国在日本的军事基地，美国在其计划中以“保障日本的安全”为借口，公然提出“日本人应提供某些基地供美军使用”。
    关于赔偿问题，美国的计划是：“所有交战国应放弃日本赔偿一九四五年九月二日（按即日本签字投降日）以前所造成的损失的要求，但已没收的日本资产可以用来抵偿战争的赔偿”。这说明美国企图将其在一九四九年五月所作的停止日本赔偿的片面决定合法化，并借此保留日本的战争工业。
    另据电通社伦敦二十日讯，美国所提和约草案规定日本拥有陆军七十万人、各种军舰五十万吨及飞机一千架。这就是恢复日本的侵略军力，作为美国的战争工具。
