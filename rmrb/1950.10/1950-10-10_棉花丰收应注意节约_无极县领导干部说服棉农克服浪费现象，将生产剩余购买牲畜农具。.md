　　Attention Should Be Paid to Saving After a Bumper Cotton Harvest
    Leaders and Cadres of Wuji County Persuade Cotton Farmers to Overcome Wasteful Phenomena and Use Production Surplus to Purchase Livestock and Farm Implements.
    [Our Newspaper News] After Wuji County, Hebei Province, had a bumper cotton harvest, many cotton farmers developed a wasteful phenomenon of eating and drinking extravagantly, which has aroused the attention of the leadership. They are now actively carrying out publicity and education to encourage cotton farmers to pay attention to saving and make long-term plans. Because of the bumper cotton harvest this year and the stable cotton prices, cotton farmers have benefited greatly, and many people have experienced serious waste. For example, in three or four villages such as Nanjiao, the masses gathered to eat and celebrate "Cotton Peach" (that is, to celebrate the bumper cotton harvest), and they ate more than a dozen large pigs in one day. In Nanliu Village, to celebrate "Cotton Peach," forty-six farmers used 384 catties of wheat to kill a pig and set up eight tables of banquets. In a certain village, a family of two people planted six mu of cotton. Now they have set a "meal schedule": "White flour once every three days, dumplings once every five days," and they eat according to the schedule. The sales volume of wine monopoly offices in various places has greatly increased recently. Many people say, "Let's drink a little. Just think of each cotton plant producing two fewer peaches. If each plant produces two fewer peaches, it will produce thirty catties less of seed cotton, which can be ginned into ten catties of lint, which can buy ten catties of wine. Drinking four taels a day can still last for more than forty days."
    After the above phenomenon was discovered by the county leadership, they have sent people to the countryside to carry out publicity and education work, persuading the masses to overcome this wasteful phenomenon, make long-term plans, and turn the surplus part of their income to purchasing agricultural tools, replacing livestock, increasing fertilizer application, and digging wells to buy waterwheels, so as to prepare conditions for further increasing production in the future.
          (Li Xiumin, Yang Xuezheng)
    (Editor's note: The bumper cotton harvest and the improved living standards of the masses are a very good phenomenon; however, the extravagant eating and drinking and extravagance and waste that have occurred in Wuji County are undesirable. If this continues, it will inevitably cause serious economic losses, which will not only affect future production, but also make future life more difficult. Such phenomena as in Wuji County may also occur in other regions, and the leaders of various localities should pay attention to them and correct and stop them in time. However, the fundamental solution is to educate the masses, so that they can make long-term plans for production, invest the surplus from production into reproduction, and prepare to overcome disasters that may occur at any time, and strive to gradually achieve a prosperous life.)

　　棉花丰收应注意节约
    无极县领导干部说服棉农克服浪费现象，将生产剩余购买牲畜农具。
    【本报讯】河北省无极县棉花丰收后，不少棉农滋长了大吃大喝的浪费现象，已引起领导上重视，正积极宣传教育棉农注意节约，作长远打算。由于今年棉花丰收，棉价平稳，棉农收益优厚，不少群众发生了严重的浪费现象。如南焦等三、四个村庄，群众集中吃饭，庆祝“棉花桃”（即庆祝棉花丰收），一天就吃了十几口大猪。南留村为庆贺“棉花桃”，四十六个农民用三百八十四斤麦子，杀了一口猪，摆了八桌席。某村一家二口人，种了六亩棉花。现在已订出“饭表”：“三天一顿白面，五天一顿饺子”，按表吃饭。各地酒业专卖处的销售量，近来大大增加，不少的群众都说：“喝点吧，只当每棵棉花少结了两个桃。每棵少结两个桃就少结三十斤籽棉，可轧十斤皮棉，就能买十斤酒，每天喝四两还喝四十多天哩。”
    以上现象经该县领导上发现后，已派人下乡进行宣传教育工作，说服群众克服这种浪费现象，从长期打算，把收益剩余的部分，转向制买农具，添换牲口，增施肥料和打井买水车等方面，为今后的生产再提高准备条件。
          （李秀民、杨学正）
    （编者按：棉花丰收，群众生活开始获得改善，这是一种很好的现象；但像无极县所发生的大吃大喝，铺张浪费，是不应该的。长此下去势必造成经济上的严重损失，不仅会影响今后的生产，而且将会使今后的生活增加很大困难。像无极县这样的现象，其他地区也可能发生，各地领导上均应引起注意，及时纠正制止。但根本的解决办法是向群众进行教育，使他们在生产上作长期打算，将生产剩余投入再生产，并准备克服随时可能发生的灾害，为逐渐作到生活富裕而奋斗。）
