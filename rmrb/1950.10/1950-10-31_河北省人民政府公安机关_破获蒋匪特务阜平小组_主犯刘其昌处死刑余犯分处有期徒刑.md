(From our Baoding dispatch) The Public Security Department of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, in conjunction with other public security departments, jointly cracked the Chiang Kai-shek military intelligence Fuping Group spy case. The Hebei Provincial People's Court resolutely implemented the policy of severely suppressing all counter-revolutionary activities, and based on the criminal facts of the bandits, sentenced the principal criminal Liu Qichang to death; the secondary criminals Liu Congzhi, Wang Rong, and Liu Wenxing were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment. The three criminals Liu Congwen, Liu Jinchang, and Meng Jiande were handed over to the Military Law Department of the North China Military Region Political Department for sentencing because they were originally military personnel.

These seven special agents were the Fuping Group under the direct leadership of the Baoding Station of the Chiang Kai-shek military intelligence agency, the Bureau of Confidential Affairs. The principal criminal, Liu Qichang, was the bandit Fuping Group's captain-level leader; Liu Jinchang had infiltrated our unit as a company commander, and later joined the bandit Fuping Group as the leader of the hidden group; Meng Jiande (deputy manager of Dafeng Cigarette Factory in our unit) was the deputy leader of the bandit Fuping hidden group; Liu Congwen (quartermaster of the small kitchen in our unit) was the warrant officer member of the bandit Fuping Group, specializing in acting as an internal traitor; Liu Congzhi was the warrant officer general affairs and receiver/sender of the Fuping Group; Liu Wenxing was the sergeant clerk of the Fuping Group. The above six criminals were all from Wangkuai Town, Fuping County; Wang Rong was from Dongdianzhuang, Mancheng, and served as an operator for the Fuping Group. They cunningly adopted public and secret methods, using business as a cover, and frequently operated in Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Beijing, and the Fuping, Dingxian, Xushui, and Tangxian areas, specifically collecting and investigating our military plans, government facilities, and rear military industrial construction intelligence within our troops and organs, and conspiring to assassinate our military and government leaders.

From its establishment in January 1948 to its dismantling in May 1949, the spy group stole as many as 1,000 copies of our intelligence, all of which were reported by radio to the former Nanjing puppet Ministry of National Defense. On several occasions, they informed the Nanjing puppet Ministry of National Defense to send planes to bomb our Shijiazhuang, Pingshan, and other places, causing considerable casualties to our military and civilians. In August 1948, after the group's operator Wang Rong obtained our military intelligence, he reported it to the bandits, and the bandit "Second Department of the North China剿匪 Headquarters" sent planes to bomb near Zijingguan, killing and injuring more than 100 of our civilian workers, and causing significant damage to vehicles and materials. These special agents also collected our military's published newspapers, maps, and leaders' names, photos, and important documents, which were sent to Chiang Kai-shek's senior special agent organizations, in order to carry out vicious sabotage against our liberated areas and our People's Liberation Army.

After the liberation of Beiping, the principal criminal Liu Qichang and others, incorrigible in their wickedness, continued to be enemies of the people, carrying out hidden activities, colluding with backward elements in our troops, and using kinship and money to buy them off as internal traitors, probing military intelligence, and conspiring to assassinate our military and government leaders. In May 1948, Liu Qichang instructed Liu Jinchang and Meng Jiande to use various means to lure and drag in Liu Congwen, the quartermaster of the small kitchen of one of our units, to report our situation. Later, Liu Qichang, Liu Jinchang, Meng Jiande, and others, again used Liu Congwen to plot to poison our military and government leaders, but the plot failed because our army quickly liberated Baoding.

The Chiang Kai-shek special agents' painstaking, despicable, and shameless acts of sabotage will never escape the net of the people's law. They were finally cracked down by our public security organs. After interrogation, all the criminals confessed to the above-mentioned crimes and also handed over a radio, two handguns.

Liu Qichang and other special agent bandits sabotaged the interests of the revolution, harmed the people, committed numerous evils, and showed no remorse. The Hebei Provincial People's Court resolutely implemented the provisions of the Common Program that "all counterrevolutionary activities must be suppressed, and all Kuomintang counterrevolutionary war criminals who colluded with imperialism, betrayed the motherland, and opposed the people's democratic cause, and other incorrigible counterrevolutionary ringleaders, must be severely punished." According to the criminal facts of the bandits, with the approval of the Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, Liu Qichang was sentenced to death; Liu Congzhi was sentenced to fifteen years of fixed-term imprisonment and deprived of political rights for ten years; Wang Rong was sentenced to five years of fixed-term imprisonment and deprived of political rights for three years; Liu Wenxing was sentenced to three years of fixed-term imprisonment and deprived of political rights for three years. On September 28th, the Provincial Court executed the principal criminal Liu Qichang by shooting in the Baoding execution ground.

　　河北省人民政府公安机关
    破获蒋匪特务阜平小组
    主犯刘其昌处死刑余犯分处有期徒刑
    【本报保定讯】河北省人民政府公安厅会同其他公安部门，联合破获蒋匪军统阜平小组特务案。河北省人民法院坚决执行严厉镇压一切反革命活动的政策，根据匪特的犯罪事实，判处主犯刘其昌死刑；分别判处次犯刘从志、王荣、刘文星以有期徒刑。刘从文、刘进昌、孟建德三犯因原是部队人员，已交由华北军区政治部军法处判处。
    这七个特务分子是蒋匪军统特务机关保密局保定站直接领导下的阜平小组。主犯刘其昌是匪阜平小组的上尉组长；刘进昌曾混进我某部当过连长，后参加匪阜平组当潜伏组长；孟建德（我某部大丰烟厂副经理）是匪阜平潜伏组副组长；刘从文（我某部小伙房司务长）是匪阜平小组的准尉组员，专作内奸活动；刘从志是阜平小组准尉总务兼收发；刘文星是阜平小组上士勤务员。以上六犯都是阜平县王快镇人；王荣是满城东佃庄人，充当阜平小组运用员。他们狡猾的采取公开和秘密的方式以经商为名，经常活动于保定、石家庄、北京和阜平、定县、徐水、唐县一带，专门在我部队、机关中，搜集调查我方军事计划、政权设施和后方军工建设等情报，并阴谋暗害我军政首长。
    该特务小组从一九四八年一月成立，到一九四九年五月破案为止，曾先后偷取我方情报达一千份之多，都用电台报告前南京伪国防部。曾有数次告南京伪国防部派来飞机轰炸我石家庄、平山等地，使我军民遭受不少伤亡。一九四八年八月，该组运用员王荣刺探得我军情报后，报告匪特，匪“华北剿总二处”曾派飞机轰炸紫荆关附近，炸死炸伤我民工一百多人，车辆物资也受很大损失。这些特务分子还搜集我军出版的报纸、地图及首长姓名、像片及重要文件等送给蒋匪高级特务组织，据以向我解放区和我人民解放军进行恶毒的破坏。
    北平解放后，主犯刘其昌等，怙恶不悛，继续与人民为敌，进行潜伏活动，勾结我部队中的落后分子，通过亲属关系和金钱收买充当内奸，刺探军情，并阴谋暗害我军政首长。一九四八年五月刘其昌指使刘进昌、孟建德，多方利诱，拉扰我某部小伙房司务长刘从文，报告我方情况。后来刘其昌、刘进昌、孟建德等，又利用刘从文，阴谋给我军政首长下毒药，因我军很快解放保定，阴谋没有达到。
    蒋匪特务分子这种千方百计卑鄙无耻的破坏罪行，绝不会逃出人民的法网。终于被我公安机关破获。全案经过审讯，各犯对上述罪恶事实供认不讳，还缴出电台一部，手枪两支。
    刘其昌等特务匪徒，破坏革命利益，残害人民，作恶多端，不思悔改，河北省人民法院坚决执行共同纲领中“必须镇压一切反革命活动，严厉惩罚一切勾结帝国主义，背叛祖国，反对人民民主事业的国民党反革命战争罪犯和其他怙恶不悛的反革命首要分子”的规定，根据匪特的犯罪事实，经该省人民政府主席批准判处刘其昌死刑；判处刘从志有期徒刑十五年，褫夺公民权十年；判处王荣有期徒刑五年，褫夺公民权三年；判处刘文星有期徒刑三年，褫夺公民权三年。九月二十八日省法院并将主犯刘其昌在保定刑场执行枪决。
