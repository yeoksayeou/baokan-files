　　Fundraising for Winter Clothing for Disaster Area People
    Fireline Theater Troupe and Others Jointly Perform to Break Through the Darkness Before Dawn
    The Political Department Cultural Troupe of the North China Military Region and the Fireline Theater Troupe of the 205th Division will jointly perform the four-act, nine-scene drama "Breaking Through the Darkness Before Dawn" at the Zhongshan Park Concert Hall starting on the 24th. All ticket revenue will be donated to disaster victims in northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Hebei, and Henan provinces for the purchase of winter clothing.
    The play was written by Comrade Fu Feng and depicts the close cooperation and mutual reliance of the military and civilians in the central Hebei plains during the War of Resistance Against Japan. It portrays the guerrilla warfare, tunnel warfare, and the life-and-death struggle between the people and the Japanese invaders and Chinese traitors, ultimately leading to victory.
