Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 13th: The grassroots people's democratic government has been established in the vast rural areas of Central South China. In all provinces of the region, with the exception of a small part of Guangxi Province and a few counties in western Hunan where banditry has not been completely suppressed, the grassroots government institutions in the villages have been initially transformed as the peasant movement develops and the peasant associations grow stronger. The feudal and reactionary Baojia system has been abolished, and township people's governments based on peasant associations have been established. The establishment of the new rural grassroots government has further consolidated the rural people's democratic dictatorship, consolidated the revolutionary order in the countryside, effectively suppressed the activities of remnants of the Kuomintang, Chiang Kai-shek, bandits, and secret agents in the countryside, and laid the foundation for the autumn grain collection work and the land reform work after the autumn harvest.

The work of transforming and establishing rural grassroots governments in Henan and Hubei provinces has progressed relatively quickly. According to statistics, there are 12,980 townships in these two provinces where the rural grassroots governments are relatively sound, 13,436 townships that have undergone initial transformation, and only a few villages in Hubei that have not yet been transformed, accounting for less than one-tenth of the total number of townships in Hubei Province. Among them, more than 200 townships in Xuchang and Nanyang Special Districts of Henan Province have convened township people's representative conferences and elected township people's government committees through universal suffrage. In other provinces, all townships where rent reduction movements have been carried out and peasant association organizations are relatively sound have also undergone initial transformation of the township governments.

The People's Governments of various provinces in Central South China have generally paid attention to the work of establishing new rural people's governments when they began to mobilize the peasants. Especially since this summer, the provinces have generally rectified the township governments while rectifying the township peasant associations. For example, in the rural areas of the counties in Changsha Special District, Hunan Province, after rectifying the peasant associations in July, the township peasant representative conferences were immediately convened. Representatives from various democratic classes in the countryside were absorbed to participate in the conferences, and township people's governments were elected. From June onwards, Hunan Province, except for western Hunan, mostly adopted this method to start the construction of township governments, which was nearly completed by the end of August. The work of transforming township government institutions in Hubei Province began during the rent reduction movement this spring. By this summer, the old Baojia system had been abolished in 90% of the rural areas of the province. At present, the province is conducting in-depth rectification of rural grassroots government institutions in conjunction with the work of rectifying peasant associations, in order to correct the impure composition and impure work style of some village cadres.

The large number of peasant activists who have emerged in the peasant movement and the large number of cadres trained by the peasant associations are the source of new rural government cadres in various provinces and the foundation for establishing new township people's governments. For example, the peasant associations in one special district of Changsha have trained more than 500 cadres. Most of these cadres are mass leaders who are warmly loved by the rural people. They are supported because they are enthusiastic about serving the people and the country, are selfless, and have an upright work style. Huang Shuzhen, chairman of the Women's Federation of Zhelong Township, Fenyi County, Jiangxi Province, worked tirelessly to mobilize women during the rent reduction movement, and is now elected as the township head by the people of the township. Lu Weimei, chairman of the Dahekou Village Peasant Association in Qichun County, Hubei Province, Huang Guangsheng, chairman of the Shenjiacheng Village Peasant Association in Lishan County, and Bu Xiaoyu, chairman of the Qingshi Township Peasant Association in Yiyang County, Hunan Province, have all repeatedly rejected bribes from landlords in their work, demonstrating a solemn people's stance and a clean and noble character, and are now elected as township government cadres. All localities pay great attention to the training of rural cadres. In addition to training in the work, each county also has rotational training classes. The enthusiastic participation of peasants in government affairs is the result of the improvement of peasant consciousness. For example, when Henan began to transform the township government during the anti-local tyrant and rent reduction movement last year, many honest peasants did not dare to come forward to handle affairs. They believed that they had always been managed and did not know how to handle affairs, and were afraid of making mistakes. Later, as the peasants' consciousness improved, they saw that some old township government personnel who could not be transformed were corrupt and wasteful and could not serve the people and the country, so they came out themselves. In addition, rural handicraftsmen, intellectuals, etc., are another source of township government cadres.

　　中南区农村基层政权已建立
    废除旧保甲制度，纠正某些干部不纯作风，为秋征及土改打下基础。
    【新华社汉口十三日电】中南区广大农村的基层人民民主政权已经建立。该区各省除广西省小部分和湘西几个匪患未肃清的县以外，随着农民运动的开展，农民协会的日益发展壮大，乡村的基层政权机构均已经过初步改造，封建的、反动的保甲制度已被废除，以农民协会为基础的乡人民政府已经建立起来。农村基层新政权的建立进一步巩固了农村人民民主专政，巩固了农村的革命秩序，有力地镇压了农村中美蒋余孽土匪特务的活动，并为秋征工作和秋后的土地改革工作打下了基础。
    河南、湖北两省改造与建立农村基层政权的工作进展较快，据统计：该两省的农村基层政权已经比较健全的有一万二千九百八十个乡，经过初步改造的有一万三千四百三十六个乡，还未经过改造的只有湖北的少数乡村，还不到湖北全省总乡数的十分之一。其中河南省许昌、南阳两个专区，已有二百多个乡召开过乡人民代表大会，以普选方式，选举成立了乡人民政府委员会。其他各省凡经过减租运动，农民协会组织比较健全的乡，乡政府也都经过初步改造。
    中南区各省人民政府在开始发动农民时，即已普遍注意建立新的农村人民政权的工作。特别是今年夏天以来，各省在整顿乡农民协会同时，更普遍整顿了乡政府。如湖南省长沙专区各县农村，在七月份整顿农民协会后，立即就召开乡农民代表会议，会上并吸收农村各个民主阶层的代表参加，选举成立了乡人民政府。从六月份起，湖南省除湘西以外，大都采用这种方法开始进行乡村政权的建设工作，到八月底都已接近完成。湖北省改造乡村政权机构的工作，是从今春减租运动中开始的。到今年夏天，全省百分之九十的农村，就都已废除了旧保甲制度。目前该省正在结合整顿农民协会的工作，深入地进行整顿农村基层政权机构，以纠正某些乡村干部成份不纯和作风不纯的现象。
    在农民运动中涌现出来的大批农民积极分子，农民协会培养出来的大批干部，就是各省新的农村政权干部的源泉，是建立新的乡人民政权的基础。如长沙一个专区的农民协会就培养出五百多干部。这些干部大都是为农村人民所热烈爱戴的群众领袖。他们获得拥护，是因为他们热心为人民为国家办事，大公无私，作风正派。江西省分宜县箦龙乡妇女会主席黄淑贞，在减租运动中苦口婆心地发动妇女，夙夜奔走，热心办事，现在已为该乡人民选为乡长，湖北蕲春县大河口村农会主席吕渭梅、礼山县沈家城村农会主席黄光盛、湖南益阳县青石乡农会主席卜晓余等，在工作中都曾多次拒斥地主的贿赂，表现了严正的人民立场和廉洁的高尚品德，现在都被选为乡政干部。各地都很注意对农村干部的培养工作，除在工作中培养外，各县都办有轮训班。农民踊跃参政，这是农民觉悟提高的结果。如河南在去年反恶霸减租运动中开始改造乡政权时，老实农民还多不敢出头办事。他们认为自己从来是被管的，不会办，怕办错。后来农民觉悟提高，他们看见一部分不能改造的旧的乡政人员贪污浪费，不能为人民和国家办事，他们才自己出来了。此外，农村手工业者、知识分子等等，则是乡政干部的另一个来源。
