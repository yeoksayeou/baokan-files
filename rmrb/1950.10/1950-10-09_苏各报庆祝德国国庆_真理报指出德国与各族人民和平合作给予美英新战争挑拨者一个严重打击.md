Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th: According to TASS, Moscow, 7th: The central Soviet newspapers widely celebrated the first anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic on the 7th.

All newspapers published on their front pages the congratulatory telegram from Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, to Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, and the congratulatory telegram from Shvernik, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, to Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, as well as other congratulatory telegrams.

Pravda's editorial stated: One year ago, the German people established a democratic republic, thereby declaring to the world that they had adopted the path of democratic development and the path of peaceful cooperation with all freedom-loving nationalities in the world. This event dealt a severe blow to the adventurous plans of the new war provocateurs of Anglo-American imperialism. The significant achievements of the German Democratic Republic in restoring the economy, building culture, and developing a democratic nation over the past year have inspired the people of all of Germany. The victory of the German Democratic Republic is increasingly and powerfully convincing the working people of West Germany that the independent development of Germany in all aspects along a truly peaceful path can only be achieved under a unified, independent, and democratic national system. Pravda stated: US and British imperialists are shamelessly undermining the Potsdam Agreement, attempting to turn Germany into a springboard for aggressive war and the German people into cannon fodder. However, the German people are fighting even more resolutely for the unification of their country on a democratic and peaceful basis. They are organizing resistance to the occupation policies of the Western powers, and they are responding to the crimes of the war provocateurs with these actions.

In addition to publishing an editorial, Pravda also published lengthy articles by Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, and Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic.

Izvestia, Trud, and Krasnaya Zvezda also published articles celebrating the National Day of the German Democratic Republic. All newspapers also published President Pieck's radio address.

    真理报指出德国与各族人民和平合作给予美英新战争挑拨者一个严重打击
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科七日讯：七日苏联中央各报广泛庆祝德意志民主共和国成立一周年纪念。
    各报皆以首页刊载苏联部长会议主席斯大林致德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥的贺电和苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席什维尔尼克致德意志民主共和国总统皮克的贺电及其他贺电。
    真理报社论称：一年以前，德国人民成立了民主共和国，从而向全世界宣称，他们采取了民主发展的道路，采取了与全世界一切爱好自由的各族人民和平合作的道路。这件事给予了英美帝国主义新战争挑拨者的冒险计划一个严重的打击。德意志民主共和国一年来在恢复经济、文化建设和发展民主国家方面的重大成就，鼓舞了全德国的人民。德意志民主共和国的胜利愈来愈有力地使西德的劳动人民相信，要德国各方面沿着真正和平的道路而独立发展，只有在一个统一、独立、民主的国家体制下。真理报称：美英帝国主义者无耻地破坏波茨坦协定，企图把德国变成侵略战争的跳板，把德国人民变成炮灰。但是德国人民却正在更顽强地为争取在民主和平的基础上统一他们的国家而斗争，他们已在有组织地反抗西方大国的占领政策，他们以这些行动来答复战争挑拨者的罪行。
    真理报除发表社论外，并刊载了德意志民主共和国总统皮克和德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥的长篇论文。
    消息报、劳动报、红星报也都刊载了庆贺德意志民主共和国国庆的论文。各报并都刊载了皮克总统的广播演说。
