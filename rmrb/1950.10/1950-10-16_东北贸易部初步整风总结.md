　　Preliminary Rectification Summary of the Northeast Trade Department
   (I)
　　The first stage of the Trade Department's rectification was carried out under the leadership of the Party Group, with the participation of department, bureau, division chiefs, and company managers forming the central team. Over the past month, the following three issues have been preliminarily studied and resolved:
　　1. Planning Issues:
　　In the past, the trade department's plans were incomplete and impractical, and the coordination between various parties was insufficient. For example, in grain procurement, various regions overestimated the disaster situation, leading to smaller grain procurement plans. The procurement, sales, storage, and transportation plans for pork and eggs were not coordinated, leading to the suspension or delay of procurement in April and May, resulting in sluggish sales and price drops, damaging the government's prestige. The recovery plans were set too high. This was mainly due to the lack of thorough and systematic investigation and research on grain production and consumption in various regions, insufficient realistic analysis of certain objective and subjective conditions, and the failure to identify changes in a timely manner and take appropriate measures based on these changes.
　　2. Lack of Overall Planning and Reasonable Prices Considering All Parties in Economic Relations:
　　This is mainly reflected in the state-owned trade's lack of organization and leadership over the private economy, overestimating its own strength, and neglecting the positive role of guiding the private economy to jointly participate in the huge commodity circulation in a planned way. State-owned trade lacked a clear scope of operation and reasonable prices considering all parties (especially regional price differences and wholesale and retail prices). There was a lack of unified research and improvement in the industrial and commercial management work in various regions, and the ordering of processing from private enterprises still lacked planning. All of this has, to some extent, affected the legitimate operation and reasonable division of labor of the private economy.
　　3. Economic Accounting System of State-Owned Trade
　　State-owned trade itself lacked economic accounting thinking in its management, a reasonable property management system, precise cost accounting, and investigation and research on people's needs, resulting in blindness in commodity allocation and transportation. This led to a bureaucratic style at the lower levels of "selling whatever we have" instead of "selling whatever the people need." Although the requirement to strengthen economic accounting had been put forward in the past, it lacked specific content and implementation steps, and thus failed to be earnestly implemented.
　　In short, in the execution of tasks, there was a lack of in-depth study of policies, leading to a failure to earnestly implement them, neglecting the basic task and requirements of organizing normal commodity circulation, promoting industrial and agricultural production, and improving people's lives to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. This was particularly evident between April and May of this year, when production was stockpiled in various sectors, there was a shortage of currency in rural areas, and urban and rural areas were stagnant. State-owned trade failed to fully play its role as a link.
　　At present, the central issue of trade work in the Northeast is to invigorate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, both domestically and externally, in order to expand and accelerate commodity turnover. To this end, it is necessary to closely integrate various economic components, make good arrangements for the procurement of agricultural products according to plan, expand the sales of state-owned and public industrial products, support cooperatives, lead the private economy, implement the policy of overall planning and taking all factors into consideration, achieve a planned and reasonable division of labor, with each getting what it deserves; determine and implement reasonable prices; implement the economic accounting system within the trade system itself, and improve business management.
　　In the inspection work, the leadership style of the Trade Department was also checked. The main shortcomings found were: bureaucratic leadership, lack of in-depth study and implementation of major policy issues; lack of democratic style, insufficient listening to the opinions of lower levels and giving them time to think about problems; some plans were set too large, and in the implementation, emphasis was placed on completion without timely research into the situation and consideration of revisions, thus giving rise to commandism; the work arrangements lacked ideological education and specific assistance, and the relationship with various departments lacked initiative, failing to correctly implement the contract system. For example, regarding imported materials, various departments decided not to transfer accounts, affecting the overall interests.
　　(II)
　　Over the past month, the experience of rectification has been as follows:
　　1. Identify Key Issues and Avoid Generalization
　　It is necessary to correctly grasp the rectification guidelines of the Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau, focus on the specific situation of the department, grasp the key issues, deeply examine the work, raise it to the level of policy thinking, link it to the examination of leadership style, earnestly analyze and criticize, seek to improve the work, and take a step forward in policy thinking. In the early stage of rectification, in order to widely collect problems and promote democracy, we spent several times conducting general discussions. In the speeches, issues in various aspects were raised, especially more issues in leadership style. This kind of general discussion inevitably falls into generalization, making it impossible to solve the problems. Talking about leadership style alone, divorced from specific work, easily becomes trivial and neglects major issues. After the instruction of the Northeast Bureau, we established a Party Group, strengthened leadership, and concentrated on the problems. The work of the trade department is complex and there are many problems. We gradually summarized them into three main key issues; we studied them in groups according to the nature of the problems, made full preparations, and combined them with group discussions. This method of concentrating on problems and preparing in groups facilitates the resolution of problems.
　　Combining work, deeply studying and understanding relevant documents, so that rectification does not remain at the general level of simple technical inspection of the old days, but truly takes a step forward in policy thinking, is very necessary.
　　2. Combine Top-Down with Focus
　　In order to solve the key issues, it is necessary to focus on the examination of the policy views and leadership style of leading cadres at the department, bureau, division chief, and manager level first, and enlighten everyone's thinking from top to bottom. In the first stage, we concentrated our efforts on carrying out rectification in the central team to avoid decentralized leadership; but on this basis, it is necessary to contact leaders at all levels, focus on the center, and widely check and study ways to improve the work. This method of combining top-down makes the leaders at all levels actively move, making rectification everyone's business, so that we can gather the wisdom of the masses to seek to solve problems in depth. And promptly implement the problems found in the inspection, so that everyone can see the effect of rectification and become interested.
　　3. Seek Truth from Facts in Review, Correctly Carry out Criticism and Self-Criticism:
　　When checking the work, it is necessary to carefully analyze the situation at that time, conduct criticism and self-criticism in a realistic manner, review the shortcomings of the work itself, and correctly point out the requirements for other aspects in order to seek common improvement. Indiscriminately reviewing any responsibility to oneself blindly will not benefit the improvement of the work of raising cadres.
　　4. Combine Inspection of Work with Future Improvement:
　　Rectification must be based on summarizing past work to improve future work. Therefore, it is necessary to study the root cause of the key problems, analyze the situation, find the reasons, determine the future improvement methods, and implement them in the links at all levels. In this regard, in addition to concentrating our efforts to prepare for the Northeast Commercial Work Conference convened by the Northeast Bureau, we have already convened and are preparing to continue to convene various specialized meetings, such as the flour processing meeting, the industrial raw material procurement and sales meeting, the statistics meeting, and the price meeting, and we are preparing to convene various local product meetings, production and sales forums, etc., to implement policies and determine methods. This kind of led and prepared meeting consultation is generally effective in improving the work.
　　Organize inspection groups led by main cadres to go down to specifically help the work, implement the results of rectification, and collect information to study experience in order to further improve and enhance the work.
　　5. Hold Short-Term Research Classes to Summarize Work and Collect Opinions:
　　In order to combine with various provinces and cities, we also adopted the form of short-term research classes, convening managers of department stores, grain, and local product companies in various counties, and section chiefs of provincial and municipal companies, to summarize work, collect opinions, and promptly introduce the problems found in the rectification of the department to them, which is helpful for understanding the situation below, enlightening the lower levels to pay attention to grasping policies, and researching work. However, since the time of holding it was earlier, and the rectification from top to bottom had just begun, and there were no mature opinions, it failed to achieve greater results.
　　(III)
　　We started the second phase of rectification in early September. At that time, in order to prepare for the upcoming Northeast Commercial Work Conference (bureau, division chiefs, and managers must participate), it was decided to suspend the rectification of the central team and start the rectification of various bureaus, divisions, and companies. Led by bureau, division chiefs, and company managers, section chiefs and cadres at the equivalent of section chief level were absorbed to form a rectification team to focus on the main work of the bureaus, divisions, and companies, and further check the leadership of the Trade Department. First, we spent two weeks studying documents (Northeast Bureau rectification documents and department rectification materials), combined with the specific situation of the unit, and determined the key issues for inspection in order to carry out the plan.
　　Recently, we have focused on inspecting department stores, hardware, coal construction, oil and fat companies, and finance and accounting departments, and found the following:
　　① Problems were raised in a general way, without grasping the key issues; ② Principles were put forward in a general way, and when inspecting the guidelines and plans, they were not combined with the central issues of the unit; ③ They were willing to talk about trivial matters related to life, but remained silent on major work issues, and were not good at observing and summarizing essential issues from some minor issues.
　　This shows that our responsible comrades are not good at frequently checking and summarizing the work, grasping the central link of the work, and analyzing and considering our tasks from the overall requirements of economic construction at all times. Therefore, we cannot correctly estimate our work and grasp the key. Secondly, many responsible cadres do not have a thorough understanding of the basic principle of this rectification focusing on solving key issues and conducting in-depth checks on the leadership of the bureau, division, and company to further improve the leadership of the department. The department affairs meeting on September 21 specifically discussed this issue, and decided:
　　1. Continue to accurately determine the rectification issues of the unit, and carry out after the approval of the Party Group; 2. The rectification method must focus on the positive aspects of solving problems and correct the attitude to avoid falling into empty review and deviation; 3. The Party Group should divide the work and focus on specific help.

　　东北贸易部初步整风总结
   （一）
    贸易部整风第一阶段，是以部、局、处长及公司经理组成中心小组，在党组领导下进行的。月余以来，初步研究与解决了以下三个问题：
    一、计划问题：
    过去贸易部门计划不周密、不实际，各方衔接不够。如购粮，各地对灾情估计过高，把购粮计划订的小了。猪肉、鸡蛋的采购、推销、贮运计划不衔接，至四、五月间，不得不中途停购、缓购，形成滞销跌价，损害政府威信。回笼计划订的大了。这主要是各地对粮食产量、消耗，缺乏周密系统的调查研究，对若干客观及主观条件的现实性分析不足，未能随时看出变化，根据条件的变化，采取适当的措施。
    二、与各种经济关系，缺乏统筹思想及三方照顾的合理价格：
    这主要表现在国营贸易缺乏对私营经济的组织领导，过高估计了本身力量，忽视有计划地引导私营经济共同参加巨大商品流转的积极作用。国营贸易缺乏明确的经营范围，及三方照顾的合理价格（特别是地区差价及批发零售价格）。对各地工商管理工作缺乏统一研究与改进，向私人企业的加工订货还缺乏计划性等。这都一定程度地影响了私人经济的正当经营及合理分工。
    三、国营贸易的经济核算制
    国营贸易本身经营管理中缺乏经济核算思想，缺乏合理财产管理制度，无精确成本核算，缺乏对人民需要的调查研究，商品调拨运输上存在盲目现象。以致下边产生“有什么卖什么”，而不能作到“人民要什么卖什么”的机关化作风。过去虽已提出关于加强经济核算的要求，但缺乏具体内容及实施步骤，因而未能认真贯彻。
    总之，在执行任务中，缺乏对政策的深刻研究，以致未能认真贯彻政策，忽视组织正常商品流转，促进工农业生产，改善人民生活，以巩固工农联盟的基本任务与要求。特别集中表现在今年四、五月间，各方面生产品积压，农村货币不足，城乡死滞，国营贸易未能充分发挥其纽带作用。
    目前东北贸易工作中心问题在于搞活城乡内外物资交流，以扩大与加速商品周转。为此必须紧密结合各种经济成分，按计划作好农产品收购，扩大推销国公营工业产品，扶助合作社，领导私人经济，贯彻统筹兼顾政策，作到有计划的合理分工，各得其所；确定与执行合理价格；在贸易系统本身贯彻经济核算制，改进经营管理。
    在检查工作中，联系检查了贸易部领导作风。发现主要缺点是：事务主义领导，缺乏对重大问题政策问题的深刻研究与贯彻；缺乏民主作风，倾听下级意见及给与下级思考问题时间不够；部分计划订大了，执行中强调完成，未及时研究情况，考虑修正，因而产生了命令主义；对工作布置缺乏思想教育及具体帮助，与各部门关系缺乏主动，未能正确执行合同制。如进口物资，各部门确定不予转账，影响了全局利益。
    （二）
    月余来整风经验有如下几点：
    一、找好关键问题，避免一般化
    必须正确掌握中央及东北局的整风方针，针对本部具体情况，抓住关键问题，深入检查工作，提高到政策思想水平，联系检查领导作风，认真分析批判，求得改进工作，并从政策思想上提高一步。整风初期，我们为了广泛搜集问题，发扬民主，曾用了几次时间，进行泛泛讨论。在发言中提出各方面问题，尤以领导作风方面问题较多。这种泛泛的讨论，就必然陷于一般化，使问题无从解决。脱离具体工作，单谈领导作风，易流繁琐而忽视重大问题。在东北局指示后，我们成立了党组，加强了领导，集中了问题。贸易部门工作复杂，存在问题较多，我们逐步归结于三个主要关键问题；按问题性质分组研究，充分准备，结合大组讨论。这种集中问题，分组准备的方法是便于问题的解决的。
    结合工作，深刻研究与领会有关文件，使整风不停留在旧的单纯技术检查的一般水平，而真正从政策思想上提高一步，是十分必要的。
    二、上下结合有重点进行
    为解决关键问题，必须有重点地首先着重部、局、处长经理级领导干部的政策观点与领导作风的检查，自上而下地启发大家的思想。我们在第一阶段中，集中力量在中心小组进行整风，避免分散领导；但又必须在此基础上，联系各级领导干部，围绕中心，广泛检查，研究改进工作的办法。这种上下结合的办法，使各级领导干部都积极动起来，使整风成为大家的事，这样才能集思广益，以求深入解决问题。并把检查中发现的问题，及时贯彻下去，使大家看到整风效果，发生兴趣。
    三、实事求是的检讨，正确的开展批评与自我批评：
    检查工作时，必须认真分析当时情况，实事求是的进行批评与自我批评，检讨本身工作缺点，正确指出对其它方面的要求，以求共同改进。不分皂白地把任何责任都给自己盲目检讨一番，对提高干部改进工作并无好处。
    四、检查工作与今后改进相结合：
    整风必须建立在总结过去工作以改进今后工作的基础上。因此，必须研究关键问题的症结所在，分析情况，找出原因，确定今后的改进办法，并在各级环节中贯彻下去。在这方面我们除集中力量准备东北局所召开的商业工作会议以外，已经并准备继续召开各种专门会议，如已经开过的面粉加工会议、工业原料购销会议、统计会议、物价会议，并准备召开各种土产会议、产销座谈会等，以贯彻政策，确定办法。这种有领导有准备的会议协商，对改进工作一般是有效的。
    组织以主要干部带领的检查团，到下面具体帮助工作，贯彻整风成果，并收集情况，研究经验，以达进一步改进和提高工作的目的。
    五、举办短期研究班，总结工作，搜集意见：
    为了与各省市结合，也采用了短期研究班形式，召集各县百货、粮食、土产公司经理，省市公司科长，以一月时间，总结工作，搜集意见，并把部整风中发现的问题及时介绍给他们，这对了解下情，启发下级注意掌握政策，研究工作上，都有一定帮助。但由于举办的时间较早，上下整风刚才开始，都无成熟意见，未能获得更大效果。
    （三）
    九月初我们开始了第二阶段的整风。当时为准备即将召开的东北商业工作会议（局、处长经理须参加），决定中心组整风暂停，开始各局、处公司整风，以局、处长公司经理为首，吸收科长和相当科长级干部参加，组成整风小组，以检查局、处公司的主要工作为主，进一步检查贸易部的领导。先用两周时间学习文件（东北局整风文件及部整风材料），结合本单位具体情况，确定检查的关键问题，以便有计划地进行。
    最近我们重点检查了百货、五金、煤建、油脂公司和财、会处等单位，发现以下情况：
    ①泛泛提出问题，没有抓住关键问题；②笼统提出原则，检查方针计划时，未与本单位中心问题相结合；③愿谈关系生活上的琐事，而对重大工作问题表示沉默，不善于从若干细小问题中观察与归纳本质问题。
    这说明我们各个负责同志不善于经常检查总结工作，掌握工作中心环节，时刻从总的经济建设要求上来分析考虑我们的任务。因之不能正确估计我们的工作，抓住关键所在。其次，许多负责干部对此次整风着重解决关键问题，从局、处、公司领导上深入检查，以进一步改进部的领导的基本方针认识尚不透彻。九月二十一日部务会议专门进行了讨论，为改变此种情况，决定：
    一、继续准确地确定单位整风问题，经党组批准后进行；二、整风方法须从解决问题的积极方面着眼，并端正态度，以避免陷于空泛检讨及发生偏差；三、党组分工，重点具体帮助。
