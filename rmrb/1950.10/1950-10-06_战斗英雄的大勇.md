　　The Great Courage of a Combat Hero
　　Wei Jinzhi
　　If one dares to die, he is not likely to die, and will even win; the deeds of combat heroes have already proven this rule.
　　To dare to die does not mean simply seeking death, but rather not fearing death, not accepting death, to the point where one is unwilling to die without exacting a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand times the price. Therefore, such daring to die not only lacks the terror of death, but also has the confidence of victory. Because of this, even when facing a formidable enemy, one's hands will not tremble, one's legs will not shake, one's head will not become dizzy, one's eyes will be able to observe in all directions, one's ears will be able to hear from all sides, and one's mind will be able to generate ingenious plans to achieve victory. Only in this way can one be as still as a virgin, as swift as a rabbit, and subdue the enemy with a single move.
　　Daring to die is not easy. For example, in reactionary armies, conscripts are unwilling to die, forced laborers are unwilling to die, those driven by hunger and cold do not find it worth dying, those who came for wealth must estimate the amount of wealth and are unwilling to die without certainty, and those who came for promotion must weigh the rank and are unwilling to die in vain. Whether unwilling to die, not wanting to die, not finding it worth dying, not being able to die without certainty, or unwilling to die in vain, as long as there is the slightest unwillingness to die, one cannot be determined to die; without determination to die, one cannot escape the terror of death.
　　Historically, it is common to see individuals or families who, due to being insulted or humiliated, strive to become strong, turn weakness into strength, and eventually avenge their wrongs and wipe away their shame. However, if seeking personal revenge and wiping away personal hatred is not combined with the liberation struggle of the oppressed classes and oppressed nations, then one person's hatred is often limited to killing the enemy, and one family's hatred is often limited to destroying the wrongdoer. Fundamentally speaking, this lacks political importance. Because of this, once the enemy is killed and the wrongdoer is destroyed, one is content and can no longer achieve anything, even engaging in cyclical revenge without end. If this situation occurs between oppressed nations and oppressed classes, it only benefits the common enemy of both sides, who laughs at them.
　　However, revolutionary fighters educated by the Communist Party can recognize true friends and enemies, and bravely advance fearlessly in the face of the enemy's swords and shadows. Their hatred is hatred for the reactionary class, hatred for the reactionary government; it is hatred for the imperialist system. This hatred is the greatest hatred. Their love is love for the revolutionary class and love for the working people. Such love is the greatest love. With such hatred and love, one can be unafraid of death, unshaken in the face of great difficulties, unproud after making great contributions, and able to connect one's own struggle to the foundation of serving the people, without ever being satisfied or stopping. This is called great courage. I saw the expression of this kind of great courage at this National Combat Heroes Conference.

　　战斗英雄的大勇
    魏金枝
    敢死，他就不容易死，并且还会胜利；战斗英雄们的战迹，已经证明了这一个法则。
    所谓敢死，并不是一死了事，而是不怕死，不甘死，以至于非取得十百倍千万倍的代价不肯死，因此这样的敢死，不但没有死亡的恐怖，而且还有胜利的信心。也就因此，虽临大敌，手才不抖，腿才不颤，头才不昏，眼才能观四方，耳才能听八面，心才能生出出奇制胜的妙计。惟其如此，才能静如处女，动如脱兔，一出手便制了敌人的死命。
    敢死并不容易。例如在反动的军队里，抽丁抽来的不肯死，拉夫拉来的不愿死，被饥寒驱逼来的不值得死，为发财而来的要估计财物的多少而不肯必死，为升官而来的得酌量官阶的高低而不愿白死。无论不肯死、不愿死、不值得死、不能必死、不愿白死，只要有一丝一毫不肯死，就不能决死；不能决死，就不能免除死亡的恐怖。
    在历史上，为了个人或家族被侮、被辱，因而奋发为雄，转弱为强，以至于报了仇，雪了恨。这种情形是习见的。然而若是为了报私仇雪私恨，而不是和被压迫阶级与被压迫民族的解放斗争结合起来，则一人的仇，往往只限于杀了仇人为止，一家的仇，往往只限于灭了冤家为止。从根本上讲，没有政治上的重要性。也就因此，等到杀了仇人，灭了冤家，也便心满意足，不能再有什么作为，甚至循环报复，永无休止。如果这种情形是出现在被压迫民族与被压迫阶级之间，这只是便宜了双方的公敌，为公敌所窃笑。
    然而，在共产党的教育下的革命战士则能认清真正的敌友，在敌人的刀光剑影中勇往直前，无所畏惧。他们的仇恨，是对反动阶级的仇恨，对反动政府的仇恨；是对帝国主义制度的仇恨。这种仇恨，才是最大的仇恨。他们的爱情，是对革命阶级的爱情、对劳动人民的爱情。这样的爱情，才是最大的爱情。有了这样的仇恨和爱情，才能不怕死，才能临大难而不动摇，才能立大功而不骄傲，才能将自己的战斗连结在为人民服务的基础上，而永无满足休止的一天，这才叫做大勇。我在这次全国战斗英雄大会上就看见了这一种大勇精神的表现。
