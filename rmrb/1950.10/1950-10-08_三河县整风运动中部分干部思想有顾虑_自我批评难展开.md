In the Sanhe County Rectification Movement, Some Cadres Have Ideological Concerns and Self-Criticism is Difficult to Unfold

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] In the Sanhe County, Hebei Province, Rectification Movement of the Chinese Communist Party, several deviations occurred in the development of criticism and self-criticism: First, some cadres had ideological concerns about fear of retaliation and fear of being disadvantaged. Some said that they could offer opinions among colleagues, but they did not dare to boldly criticize leaders, especially their direct superiors. Some were observing the attitude of the leading comrades. This situation is inseparable from the lack of criticism and self-criticism spirit on the part of the leadership. This spring, Hu Yupou, a cadre and party member of the Sanhe County Government, reported to the county party committee the fact that section member Li Ming had embezzled public funds and requested the county party committee to investigate. The person in charge of the county government was very unhappy when he heard this and instead criticized Hu, saying, "If the problem reported is not a fact, you will be fully responsible." Hu had to admit his mistake and dared not say anything more. Xi Zhao, a teacher in the seventh district of the county, wrote an article criticizing "the leadership's drainage work was not done well, and the crops were damaged." The county's propaganda minister was very dissatisfied and asked him to revise it. Second, on the surface, they like self-criticism and dislike mutual criticism; in reality, they are unwilling to boldly expose shortcomings. When others criticize themselves, they always find a lot of objective reasons to prevaricate, and when criticizing others, they are always afraid of hurting people and afraid that others will also criticize themselves impolitely. Most of these cadres carry the burden of pride and complacency. There are also some cadres who will talk about things that others know, even at the cost of wearing a few more hats; but they will never say anything that others do not know. They believe that "telling the truth is stupid" and "asking for self-criticism is a good way for superiors to find fault." The county supply and marketing cooperative could not carry out criticism and self-criticism well in the early stage of the rectification movement because of these deviations. Fourth, they only accept criticism but do not seriously correct their mistakes. In the county, many comrades have reviewed and criticized the same shortcomings three or five times in group meetings, but they do not expose the ideological roots, but only prevaricate with "will change next time" and "must change." The Sanhe County Party Committee's leadership style is procrastinating, and the reward and punishment of cadres is not strict. Over the past year, the higher-level party committee and party members and the masses have repeatedly raised criticisms, and the county party committee has also repeatedly expressed its acceptance of criticism, but to this day, this shortcoming still exists seriously. Fifth, critics often adopt a rude attitude of "attack" and "venting anger," coupled with the lack of a "correct mistakes if you have them, guard against them if you don't" spirit by those who are criticized, often leading to a stalemate. A party group meeting in the county government once broke up in a commotion.

The main reason for this erroneous understanding is that the county leadership adopts a bureaucratic attitude towards criticism and even blocks criticism. Party members and cadres also do not understand the positive significance of criticism and self-criticism. Therefore, the Sanhe County Party Committee must earnestly carry out ideological struggle in all party organizations and cadres, the leadership must first conduct sincere and realistic self-criticism, and solve several problems that must be solved according to everyone's opinions, guide the general cadres to correctly use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and ensure the victorious completion of the rectification movement.

### 三河县整风运动中部分干部思想有顾虑  自我批评难展开

　　三河县整风运动中部分干部思想有顾虑
    自我批评难展开
    【本报讯】中共河北省三河县整风运动中，在开展批评与自我批评方面，曾发生几种偏向：首先是部分干部思想上存在怕报复，怕对自己不利的顾虑。有的说同级之间还可以提个意见，对领导者，尤其是对直属上级则不敢大胆批评。有的在观望着领导同志的态度。这种情况与领导上批评与自我批评精神不够是分不开的。今春三河县政府干部党员胡玉璞，向县委反映科员李明贪污公款事实，要求县委调查。县府负责人听了很不愉快，反而批评胡说：“反映的问题如不是事实，要负完全责任。”胡只好承认错误，不敢再说。该县七区教员夕照，写了一篇批评“领导上排水作的不好，庄稼受害”的稿子，该县宣传部长大为不满，要他重新更正。第二是表面上喜欢自我批评，不喜欢互相批评；实际上自己也不肯大胆揭露缺点。别人批评自己时，总要找一堆客观原因搪塞，批评别人时，也总怕伤了人，怕别人也不客气的批评自己。这些干部大部背有骄傲自满的包袱。还有一些干部是别人知道的事情可以讲出来，甚至不惜多戴几个帽子；别人不知道的怎么也不肯说。他们认为“说实话是傻瓜”，“叫检讨是上级找毛病的好办法”。县供销社在整风初期，因为存在这些偏向而不能很好开展批评与自我批评。第四是只接受批评而不认真的改正错误。该县有不少同志，同一缺点在小组会上检讨批评过三次五次，但却不去揭发思想根源，只是以“下次改”、“一定改”来搪塞。三河县委会领导上作风拖拉，干部奖惩不严等，一年来经上级党委及党员群众几次提出批评意见，县委会也几次表示接受批评，但直到今天这个缺点依然严重存在着。第五，批评者往往采取粗暴的“攻击”，“泄愤”的态度，加上被批评者缺乏“有则改之、无则加勉”的精神，常常弄成僵局。县政府一个党的小组会曾吵的一哄而散。
    产生这种错误认识的主要原因，是该县领导上对批评采取官僚主义态度，甚至阻塞批评。党员干部也不了解批评与自我批评的积极意义。因之三河县委必须在一切党的组织与干部中，认真的开展思想斗争，领导上首先进行诚恳的实事求是的自我批评，并根据大家的意见解决几个必须解决的问题，引导一般干部正确地运用批评与自我批评的武器，保证整风运动的胜利完成。
