Northeast Meihekou Station's Zhang Wanshun Shunting Team
    Sets Record of 1,000 Accident-Free Days

[This newspaper Meihekou dispatch] This newspaper correspondents Zhao Zongfan and Gao Dianying reported: The Zhang Wanshun shunting team of Meihekou Station in Northeast China has created the highest record of 1,000 accident-free days. Meihekou Station is the transportation hub of the Liaodong Railway and the busiest station in the Jilin Railway Bureau. Since 1949, it has transported an average of about 1,000 vehicles per day. The station has six shunting teams, and the Zhang Wanshun shunting team is the backbone of the station's shunting teams. From January 1948 to September 1950, the team gloriously achieved 1,000 accident-free days, successfully completing the shunting tasks of 9,332 trains. The team shunted 149,928 vehicles, safely operated 74,362 couplings, and prevented 53 major and minor accidents. It played a significant role in the Iron Ox Movement.

The team's success is attributed to the following factors: First, it humbly learned from advanced experiences. When Meihekou Station began implementing the new shunting method in March 1950, Zhang Wanshun took the lead in ensuring that the new shunting method was learned well and challenged other teams. In addition to the prescribed study time, the entire team studied the new shunting method whenever they had free time. During the trial implementation of the new shunting method on March 27, the Zhang Wanshun shunting team shortened the time to assemble a train from the prescribed 36 minutes to 26 minutes. Under the team's influence, the conservative thinking of individual shunters was broken, and the station dwell time was shortened from 10 hours to less than 7.5 hours. Second, it strictly implemented rules and regulations. Zhang Wanshun said, "Accidents will happen if rules and regulations are not followed." Some shunters believed that shunting without violating regulations would lead to delays, but the Zhang Wanshun shunting team adhered to the regulations and did not experience any delays. Third, two new systems were established: (1) Confirmation and mutual inspection system. In the past, individual couplers worked independently without communicating with each other. Some even slacked off while sitting in the car. Zhang Wanshun researched and established the "confirmation and mutual inspection system," where the first coupler goes to check the car and disconnects the air hose, and the second coupler checks whether it is correct before giving the signal to proceed, turning the shunting team members into a close-knit, interconnected entity, which played a significant role in eliminating accidents. (2) Secret code division of labor system: Zhang Wanshun found that the past "call and response" method was unclear. Some people shouted when they were more than ten cars away, while others shouted when they were only two cars away, making it difficult for shunters to understand, which could easily lead to accidents. Zhang Wanshun came up with this system, which stipulates fixed positions: the first shout is made when the distance is five cars; the second shout is made when the distance is three cars. The shunter hears the second shout and immediately stops and slowly approaches to couple. The final shout is made when the distance is one car, and a hand gesture is made to the shunter to indicate the number of cars. Since the implementation of this method, not only have major collision accidents been eliminated, but even loud collision noises have been avoided.

Zhang Wanshun is good at uniting all workers and has researched many ways to overcome accidents, enabling them to create a record of 1,000 accident-free days. Recently, all the workers of the Zhang Wanshun shunting team jointly formulated a new work plan, striving to create a record of 1,200 accident-free days by next "May Day."

　　东北梅河口站张万顺调车组
    首创千天无事故纪录
    【本报梅河口讯】本报通讯员赵宗藩、高殿英报道：东北梅河口车站张万顺调车组，创造了千天无事故的最高纪录。梅河口车站是辽东铁路运输咽喉，是吉林铁路局管内运输作业最忙的车站。一九四九年以来，每天平均运送一千辆车左右，该站有六个调车组，张万顺调车组是该站调车组的骨干，该组从一九四八年一月到一九五○年九月，光荣达成千天无事故，顺利完成了九三三二列列车的调车任务。该组调车一四九、九二八辆，安全作业七四、三六二钩，防止了大小事故五三件。在铁牛运动中起了重大作用。
    该组所以能有这样的成绩，第一，是因为虚心学习先进经验。一九五○年三月梅河口车站开始实行新调车法的时候，张万顺首先保证学好新调车法，并向各组进行挑战。全组在规定学习时间外，有空就学习新调车法，在三月二十七日试行新调车法时，张万顺调车组编成一列车，由规定的三十六分钟缩短到二十六分钟。在该组影响下，打破了个别调车员的保守思想，使停站时间由十小时缩短到七点五小时以下。第二，严格执行规章制度。张万顺说：“不执行规章制度，就要发生事故。”个别调车员认为：不违章调车就得晚点，但张万顺调车组坚持规章，并未晚点。第三，建立两种新制度：（一）确认互检制。过去个别连结员各干各的，互不连系。甚至坐在车上偷懒。张万顺研究并建立了“确认互检制”，一号连结员去查车摘风管，二号连结员去检查是否正确，然后再给号志挂走，使调车组人员成为一个密切的联动体，在消灭事故上起了重大作用。（二）暗号分工制：张万顺发现过去的“呼唤应答”不明确，有的人距离十多辆车时就喊，有时距离两辆车才喊，使调车员有时弄不清楚，很容易发生事故。张万顺想出了这个制度，规定固定位置，距离五辆喊第一次；距离三辆喊第二次，调车员听见喊第二次，即停下慢慢去连结。距离一辆再喊最后一次，并在喊的同时向调车员打手势，表示距离辆数。自实行这个办法后，不仅消灭了冲突大事故，连大的冲突声音都没有过。
    张万顺善于团结全体工友，钻研出许多克服事故的办法，使他们创造了千日无事故的纪录。最近张万顺调车组全体工友，又共同拟出新的工作计划，争取在明年“五一”创造一千二百天无事故的纪录。
