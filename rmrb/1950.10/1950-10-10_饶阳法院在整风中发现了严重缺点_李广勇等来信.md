	Raoyang Court Discovers Serious Shortcomings in Rectification
		Letter from Li Guangyong et al.

To the Editor:

	Since our county court began its rectification study, after more than ten days of examination, it has discovered serious bureaucratism. It is described as follows:

	I. Regarding the issue of women remarrying with dowry, there have been significant deviations in the handling, with many cases even being left unresolved. Some cases, even after judgment, have not been well enforced. For example, in the divorce case between Xu Su'lan (female) of Xuzhangbao Village and Song Yuanqin (male) of Nanzhangbao Village, more than a month after the county court's judgment, the male party neither executed the judgment nor appealed. Later, the female party urged the court to act, and the court wrote to the male party, ordering him to execute the judgment. The male party refused to comply and appealed to the Commissioner's Office. The court ordered the male party to give Xu Su'lan an additional 350 jin of millet, but the male party still did not comply. Thus, the matter was left unresolved for a long time. According to incomplete statistics, there are five such cases.

	II. For cases with insufficient evidence, the court does not promptly investigate and research, but detains the defendant for a long time. For example, Yin Xuan'tu (male) and Yin De (female) of Xiyin Village had an improper relationship, and Yin Xuan'tu's wife died of poisoning. Both of them were immediately brought to the county and detained. Because there was insufficient evidence at the time, no judgment was made, and they were detained for two and a half years. The homicide case of Liu Yulin in Xijiuji Village also resulted in the defendant being detained for two years due to insufficient evidence.

	III. There is a phenomenon of reversed severity in the judgments of certain cases. For example, Li Fuyou was sentenced to five months of imprisonment for stealing 24 shi dou of public grain; Huo Jinxiang of Doudian was sentenced to eight months of imprisonment for stealing two bolts of cloth from others.

	IV. Backlog of Cases: According to current statistics, there is a backlog of 300 civil cases alone. There are even cases from two years ago that have not yet been resolved.

	V. Some cases are handled blindly: Sometimes, a case cannot be resolved even after repeated inquiries. For example, in March of this year, 37 cases were resolved, but after inspection, only seven cases should have been judged, and the others should not have been judged due to insufficient evidence. Later, the relevant people were summoned to the court for further processing. This has aroused dissatisfaction among some people. The main reasons for these problems are two: First, the leadership as a whole has not paid attention to the work of the court, and when the central work comes, the court cadres are transferred. Second, the court itself has a bureaucratic style, does not trust the masses, and is divorced from the masses. At the same time, the policy level of the court cadres is low, and they are not sharp in seeing problems. Therefore, sometimes when dealing with a case, they do not base their decisions on policy, but make judgments impulsively, causing them to be detached from the masses.

### 饶阳法院在整风中发现了严重缺点  李广勇等来信

　　饶阳法院在整风中发现了严重缺点
    李广勇等来信编辑同志：
    我县法院自整风学习以来，经过十余天的检查，发现了严重的官僚主义。现分述于下：
    一、对妇女带产改嫁问题，在处理上发生很大的偏差，好多案件甚至有始无终。有些案件，虽经判决，但未很好执行。例如许张保村许素兰（女）与南张保村宋元钦（男）离婚一案，经县判决后一个多月，男方既不执行，又不上诉。后女方到法院催促，法院又写信给男方，令其按判决执行。男方不服，上诉于专署。法院令男方多给许素兰小米三百五十斤，但男方仍不执行。这样，事情就长期搁置下来了。像这样问题，据不完全统计，即有五起。
    二、对证据不足的案件，法院不及时设法调查研究，即把被告长期扣押。例如西尹村尹宣图（男）与尹德（女）二人发生不正确的男女关系，尹宣图之妻服毒死了，即将该两人传到县扣押起来。因当时证据不足，不加判决，一直把他们扣了二年半。西九吉村刘玉林人命案，也因证据不足把被告扣押了二年。
    三、对某些案件的判决，有轻重倒置的现象。如李福有偷窃公粮二十四市斗，判了徒刑五个月；豆店霍金祥偷了别人两匹布，却判了八个月的徒刑。
    四、积压案件：据现在的统计，仅民事案件即积压三百起。甚至有二年的陈案，迄未得到解决。
    五、处理案件有些盲目：有时一个案件经反复询问数次都得不到解决。如今年三月份解决了三十七件案件、后经检查只有七件是应判的，其他都因证据不足而不应判决。后来又把有关的人传到法院，另行处理。这就引起了某些群众的不满。这些问题发生的主要原因有二：第一是整个领导上没注意法院工作，中心工作来了，就抽调法院的干部。第二是法院本身有官僚主义的作风，不相信群众，脱离群众。同时，法院干部的政策水平低，看问题不敏锐，因此有时处理一个案件时，不以政策为依据，而是脑子一热即下判决，致使自己脱离了群众。
