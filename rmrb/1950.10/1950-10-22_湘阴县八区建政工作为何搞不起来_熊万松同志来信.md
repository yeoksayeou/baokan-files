　　Why the Establishment of Political Power in the Eighth District of Xiangyin County Is Not Taking Off

To the Editor:

　　Although the democratic establishment of political power in the Eighth District of Xiangyin County has been underway for two or three months, it has failed to mobilize the majority of the masses. There was neither good prior deliberation nor a detailed plan based on thorough research and extensive and in-depth publicity (i.e., clearly explaining the policies to the masses). Consequently, phenomena of paternalism and substitution have emerged in many places. Many responsible cadres of the farmers' associations in various villages dispersed when their living allowances were stopped in preparation for the establishment of political power (as was the case in Baimei Township in the district). Elections were conducted hastily at a mass meeting. The militia was nominally there to prevent bad elements from causing trouble, but in reality, it was to prevent the masses from dispersing and the meeting from failing to convene. As a result, the newly established township people's governments and township farmers' associations are merely empty shells. The chairman of the farmers' association is just a figurehead with few formal members. The head of the residents' representative committee in Baini Village has not yet been determined, and the heads of the residents' groups are also being rotated (some who are elected are not even aware of it themselves). Work in Meijiang Village has not even started. Some of the masses there not only fail to recognize the honor of participating in township government work but also mistakenly believe it to be a burden. The district government has now discovered this deviation and is assigning cadres to go down and combine the rectification of organizations with in-depth publicity alongside the autumn grain collection movement, preparing to strengthen the establishment of political power in various townships and complete the autumn grain collection.

　　湘阴县八区建政工作为何搞不起来
    熊万松同志来信编辑同志：
    湘阴县第八区民主建政工作虽已搞了两三个月，但没有把大多数群众发动起来。事先既未很好的酝酿，也无经过详细研究的计划和广泛深入的宣传（即把政策向群众解释清楚）因而许多地方产生包办代替的现象。许多村农民协会的负责干部在准备建政时，因为生活供给停止，都散了场（如该区白梅乡就是这样）。在一个群众大会上，急急忙忙的进行选举，纠察队名义上是防止坏分子捣乱，其实是防止群众走散了开不成会。因此，新成立的乡人民政府和乡农会只是个空架子。农民协会主任是个光杆主任，没有多少正式的会员。白泥村的居民代表主任至今还未确定，居民小组长也是轮流地当（有的当选了，自己还不晓得）。梅江村的工作根本就没有搞起来。该地某些群众不但没有认识到参加乡政权工作的光荣，而且还错误地认为这是个负担。区政府现已发现这一工作偏向，正分配干部下去结合秋征运动整顿组织与深入宣传，准备把各乡建政工作加强起来，并完成秋征。
