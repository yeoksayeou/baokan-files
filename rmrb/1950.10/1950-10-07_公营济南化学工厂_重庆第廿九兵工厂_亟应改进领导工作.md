　　Public Jinan Chemical Factory
    Chongqing No. 29 Arsenal
    Urgent Need to Improve Leadership Work
    A Reader's Letter of Criticism Regarding the Jinan Chemical Factory

    Editor:
    I am a worker at the Jinan Chemical Factory. I have discovered many problems here, and I am writing to you about them, and requesting that they be published in the newspaper so that they can be resolved quickly.
    There is a bureaucratic style of leadership. The factory director and other leading comrades do not bother to understand the situation in the workshops. Production plans are never discussed with the masses; they are simply passed down for execution. The Cooked Blue (dye) group has many tasks and few people, while the Soap Department has many people and few tasks. However, the factory has spent a lot of money hiring temporary workers for the Cooked Blue group, instead of transferring people from the Soap Department. The division of labor between the director and deputy director is not very clear. The deputy director, Wang Baohua, has no authority, and therefore lacks a sense of responsibility. He only provides some technical guidance on machinery and in the laboratory, and ignores everything else.
    In general, punishment is used instead of education for employees. Tang Tongyi, a storekeeping section worker, embezzled one hundred jin of oil. Later, he confessed voluntarily, but the administration did not provide any education for him, simply asking him to pay back the money for one hundred jin of oil. Now Tang is working very passively and doesn't do anything seriously. Since last year, besides Tang Tongyi, there have been Zhang Shuqing, Wang Xunqian, Wu Shengling, Li Mingfa, Jia Xiangfeng, and others who have been fined. As a result of this punishment method, the workers see the factory as belonging to the director, and their production enthusiasm is reduced.
    Workers' wages are unreasonable. The factory has been operating for two years since liberation, but the salary evaluation has only been conducted once. The lowest wage is twenty-eight fen, which is not even enough for food expenses. Apprentices like Wei Yuanxian and others are already able to independently complete the work of manufacturing Cooked Blue, but their wages are still twenty-eight fen. Liu Chunhua, the foreman of the ironwork department, only earns seventy-five fen, which reduces his initiative. Ordinary technicians are also dissatisfied with their wages. Jiang Guangzhong, Liu Chengye, and others even cursed loudly in the dormitory. Wang Yuqing (a member of the Communist Youth League), a staff member, is not motivated to work because he is dissatisfied with the factory director's patriarchal leadership style.
    The relationship between the Party and the masses is also poor. Only three or two Party members in the entire factory, such as Wang Denglai and Mei Fengsheng, their opinions replace the opinions of the masses. Those who please them are considered key personnel; those who do not please them are considered to have a poor work attitude. Liu Qufei, the head of the engineering section, is not a Party member. In his work, he is made difficult by Liu Chungong (a Party member), the head of the business section, so he does not put his heart into his work.
    As for the thoughts of the staff, they are confused and unwilling to stay in their positions. For example, Zhang Yunpeng, the accountant of the engineering section, Dai Fangzhi, the head of the accounting section, and Ding Zengming, a staff member of the business section, have all submitted their resignations to the leadership. There is also this kind of thinking among the workers.
    In short, there are many problems in the chemical factory, and I only know a part of them. I hope you can publish this letter quickly to draw the attention of relevant parties and to examine the factory's leadership work.

    Tan Shaoyi's Letter of Criticism Regarding Chongqing No. 29 Arsenal

    Editor:
    Since Chongqing Dadukou No. 29 Arsenal was taken over by the People's Government in early December last year, production has made considerable progress with the joint efforts of all the factory's employees. However, on the other hand, there are also significant shortcomings.
    The military representative has a commandist style. Often, as soon as a task is assigned, another task is assigned immediately, making it impossible for the people below to do anything well. Before the workers understood what democratic management was all about, they were asked to elect a committee to organize the factory management committee. The workers requested a postponement of the election, but the factory did not accept it. Therefore, after the establishment of the Factory Management Committee, many people did not know what this organization was for. In the past three or four months, the Factory Management Committee has only held three meetings, and the workers and even the employee representative meetings have not been informed after the meetings, making the Factory Management Committee and the employee representative meetings mere figureheads. Zhou Shichuan, the head of the Cadre Section, casually called the person in charge of the workshop and ordered them to stop work, causing confusion in the entire riveting workshop and making it impossible for the workers to concentrate on their work.
    Secondly, the administrative leaders are indifferent to the life and political education of the employees. There is no good recreational venue in the whole factory. After work, the workers can only stay at home and cannot get a good rest. The perimeter of the factory area is also not well guarded. There were six or seven thefts in the residential area in July, and a motor was also stolen in the factory area. The political education of the workers is also very poor, and the one-hour study system has not been adhered to.
    If the leadership fails to correct these issues immediately, the production of the entire factory will be seriously affected.

### 公营济南化学工厂  重庆第廿九兵工厂  亟应改进领导工作

　　公营济南化学工厂
    重庆第廿九兵工厂
    亟应改进领导工作
    一读者对济南化工厂的批评信编辑同志：
    我是济南化工厂的一个工作人员。我在这里发现很多问题，现在向你们讲一讲，并请在报纸上发表，以便能很快得到解决。
    领导上有官僚主义作风。厂长等领导同志不去了解车间里的情形，生产计划从来不通过群众讨论，光是传达下去叫执行。煮青（染料）组活多人少，肥皂部则人多活少，但工厂却花了不少的钱给煮青组雇临时工，不从肥皂部调人。正副厂长分工不很明确，副厂长王保华没有权，因而工作责任心不够，光在机器上、化验室里作一些技术上的指导，对别的事不闻不问。
    对于职工，一般是以惩办代替教育。保管股唐同义贪污了一百斤油，后来他自动说出来了，行政上没有对他进行教育，光叫他赔一百斤油钱了事。现在唐工作很消极，什么活也不认真干了。从去年到现在，被罚钱的除唐同义以外，还有张树清、王训前、吴盛龄、李铭法、贾象风等。采用这种惩办方法的结果，工人把工厂看成是厂长的，生产热情降低。
    工人工资不合理。工厂从解放至今已有二年，但评薪工作只进行了一次。最低的二十八分，连伙食钱都不够。学徒魏元贤等已经能单独完成制煮青的工作了，但工资还是二十八分。铁工部领工刘春华工资只有七十五分，因之积极性不高。一般技工也不满意工资，蒋光忠刘成业等甚至在宿舍大骂。职员王钰卿（团员）因不满意厂长家长式的领导，工作不起劲。
    党群关系也不好。全厂只有王登来、梅风生等三两个党员，他们的意见就代替了群众意见。顺他们眼的就是骨干分子；不顺他们眼的，就是工作态度不好。工务股长刘去非，因为不是党员，在工作中因受到营业股长刘纯功（党员）的为难，不尽心工作。
    至于职员的思想，表现了混乱，不安职守。如工务股会计张云鹏、会计股长戴方智、营业股职员丁增明，一起向领导提出辞职。工人当中也有这种思想情况。
    总之，化工厂的问题很多，我所了解的只是一部分。希望你们能快点发表这封信，以引起有关方面的注意，并检查一下该厂的领导工作。

    谭绍仪同志对重庆市二十九兵工厂的批评信编辑同志：
    重庆大渡口第二十九兵工厂自从去年十二月初由人民政府接管以来，在全厂职工的共同努力下，生产已经取得了相当的成绩。但从另一方面看，又有着重大的缺点。
    军事代表有命令主义作风，往往一件工作才布置下去，便又布置另一件工作，弄得下面一样都搞不好。工人还不明了民主管理是怎样一回事的时候，便叫选举委员组织工厂管理委员会了。工人要求延缓选举时间，厂方没有采纳。因此，工管会成立后，很多人不知道这个组织是干什么的。三四个月以来，工管会仅开过三次会，会后也不向工人群众甚至职工代表会作传达，弄得工管会和职工代表会都只是徒具虚名。干部科科长周世传随便打电话给工场里的负责人叫停止工作，引起了整个铆工工场的混乱，使工人不能安心工作。
    其次，行政领导人对于职工的生活、政治教育采取不关心的态度。全厂没有一个好的娱乐场所，工人下班后就只有闷在家里，不能得到良好的休息。厂区外围也没有好好的警卫，在七月份内住宅区曾连续发生被窃事件六、七起，厂区内也发生过马达被窃事件。工人的政治教育也做得很差，没有坚持一小时的学习制度。
    如果领导上不能立即加以改正，则全厂生产将受到严重的影响。
