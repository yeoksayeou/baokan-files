　　Continue to Consolidate the People's Democratic Dictatorship
　　——Celebrating the First Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China
　　Lin Boqu
　　Today is the first National Day since the founding of the People's Republic of China. The people of all nationalities across the country are celebrating this great festival with the most excitement and joy, and our foreign friends and peace-loving and democratic people all over the world are also joyfully expressing their congratulations.
　　After the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, it faithfully implemented the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, led the local people's governments at all levels, and convened people's representative conferences at all levels to make the Common Program the actual action of the Chinese people. And in a short year, it has made great achievements.
　　The People's Government faithfully carried out the task of eliminating the remnants of the enemy and liberating the whole country. All of China's territory, except for Tibet, Taiwan, and a few scattered islands, has been completely liberated. The bandit armed forces instigated by the US imperialists and organized by the Kuomintang reactionaries have been mostly wiped out. A large number of special agent organizations and spies have also been uncovered by our public security organs. The new democratic social order is being consolidated day by day.
　　The People's Government faithfully implemented the correct financial and economic policies. It unified the management and leadership of national financial and economic work, strived for a balance of financial revenue and expenditure, and achieved the stability of finance and prices; it adjusted industry and commerce, improved public-private relations and labor-capital relations; it carried out disaster relief work and water conservancy work, ensuring a bumper harvest in agricultural production. All of this has provided a good start for the basic improvement of finance and economy.
　　The People's Government faithfully implemented the correct cultural and educational policies. It promoted the people's political study movement, enabling the vast number of intellectuals and young students to participate in the study of new knowledge or participate in revolutionary work. The People's Government also focused on developing worker-peasant education and paid attention to national health. All of this has brought a new atmosphere to the vast cultural and educational front.
　　The People's Government faithfully implemented the correct ethnic policies. In the big family of the People's Republic of China, the past estrangement between ethnic groups has gradually disappeared, and they have embarked on the bright road of friendship and cooperation. In Chinese history, the various ethnic groups and the entire people have never been so closely united as they are now.
　　The People's Government faithfully implemented the correct foreign policy. Our country has established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, various new democratic countries, and some capitalist countries. We have fulfilled our due responsibilities for safeguarding world peace and opposing wars of aggression, and have been unanimously praised by international friends. In Chinese history, our international status has never been so truly elevated as it is now.
　　The people have become the masters and built their own country. The work done by the People's Government in the past year is all suitable for the progress of new China's construction and in line with the interests of the people of the whole country.
　　However, it is only a short year after all.
　　The work of the new country is still in its infancy and is still developing. The people of the whole country must carry out a great struggle on the basis of victory for their own revolutionary cause, and must continue to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.
　　On the one hand, the people of the whole country are carrying out a great struggle of genuine people's revolution on all work fronts; on the other hand, the People's Government is also timely and correctly summing up the experience of all aspects of work and formulating new work guidelines. Chairman Mao led us to do this, and we have achieved victory. We must continue to consolidate victory on the basis of victory, and continue to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, we must continue to learn. Learn to master Mao Zedong Thought, learn how Chairman Mao used the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism to specifically guide the practice of the Chinese revolution, and learn the many valuable revolutionary experiences he painstakingly taught us.
　　Now that we are celebrating the great National Day for the first time, what experiences should we learn? We should learn the two basic and main experiences of the Chinese revolution summarized by Chairman Mao in his article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "(1) Internally, arouse the masses of the people. That is, unite the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie, form a domestic united front under the leadership of the working class, and develop from this to establish a people's democratic dictatorship state led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance; (2) Externally, unite with the nations and peoples of the world who treat us as equals and fight together. That is, unite with the Soviet Union, unite with the various new democratic countries, unite with the proletariat and the broad masses of people of other countries, and form an international united front."
　　These are the two basic experiences for the Chinese people to achieve victory, and also the two basic experiences for the Chinese people to consolidate victory.
　　"Internally, arouse the masses of the people." The Chinese people followed this experience, and as a result of their struggle, they realized the great unity of the revolution and established a people's democratic dictatorship state. The people of the whole country are firmly united on the basis of the Common Program. This successful experience has gradually been extended to people's representative conferences at all levels, and has gradually been extended to the work of adjusting industry and commerce, and has begun to be extended to other work. In many aspects, it has been done seriously. All policies and resolutions of the People's Government must not only concentrate the correct opinions within the people when they are formulated, but also mobilize and organize the strength of the people to work together when they are implemented and executed. Because any work is a part of the people's revolutionary cause, it includes two aspects: implementing democracy within the people and exercising dictatorship over the people's enemies. "Arousing the masses of the people" is to educate the people to distinguish between themselves and the enemy in concrete actions, so as to adopt democratic or dictatorial methods respectively, unite themselves, and defeat the enemy. This experience is of even greater significance to the current land reform work and to the cadres of the People's Government and the working class who lead the state power. In the land reform work, we must be good at educating and organizing the peasants to unite all forces against feudalism, fight against the landlord class, and eliminate the feudal land system. In other work, we must clearly distinguish between friends and enemies, be good at using the method of criticism and self-criticism to educate ourselves, resolutely oppose the use of commandism and coercion to treat the people, and better unite all ethnic groups and the entire people to fight for the construction of the new country.
　　"Externally, unite with the nations and peoples of the world who treat us as equals and fight together." Following this experience, the Chinese people firmly united with the Soviet Union, the bastion of world peace, at the beginning of the founding of the country, and signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance with the Soviet Union, and also firmly united with various new democratic countries and all peace-loving and democratic forces in the world to jointly lean to the side of socialism.
　　The world today has two camps and two roads. The aggressive camp headed by US imperialism is trying to provoke a world war to satisfy its desire to dominate the world. This is the road to war, which violates the will of all mankind. The peace camp headed by the Soviet Union is striving to develop the world's democratic forces, resolutely defend peace, and stop the danger of war. This is the road to peace, which represents the will of all mankind. The Chinese people, in accordance with the wishes of all mankind and their own wishes, have unswervingly chosen the road to peace. The cause of the Chinese people has long been a part of the cause of the people of the world.
　　If we want to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, we must defend lasting world peace. Now, the people of the world are vigorously launching the peace signature movement, and the brave, hardworking, and peace-loving Chinese people are being swept into this struggle by millions. This is a major contribution to strengthening the strength of our international united front, and we must give full play to it.
　　If we want to defend lasting world peace, we must smash the aggressive acts of US imperialism. Now, US imperialism is frantically armed intervention in Korea, invading Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines and other places, and the United States has blatantly exposed its ambition to interfere in Asian affairs. The people of the whole country must be united as one, rise up together with the Eastern nations, and in the international peace and democracy front, make a hundredfold efforts to fight to the end to smash the aggressive atrocities of US imperialism.
　　Strive to give full play to our great strength and continue to consolidate our people's democratic dictatorship. Let us shout in glory Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of our people!

　　继续巩固人民民主专政
    ——庆祝中华人民共和国成立一周年
    林伯渠
    今天是中华人民共和国成立以来的第一个国庆日。全国各民族人民正以最兴奋最愉快的心情来庆祝这个伟大的节日，我们的外国朋友全世界爱好和平民主的人民，也都欢欣鼓舞地表示庆祝。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立后，即忠实地执行中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领，领导各级地方人民政府并召开各级人民代表会议使共同纲领成为中国人民的实际行动。而在短短一年中有了巨大成就。
    人民政府忠实执行了肃清残敌解放全国的任务。全中国的国土，除掉西藏、台湾和几个零星小岛之外，已经全部解放。美帝国主义所策动国民党反动派所组织的土匪武装已大部肃清。特务组织和间谍分子也被我公安机关大批破获。新民主主义的社会秩序，一天一天地在巩固起来。
    人民政府忠实执行了正确的财政经济政策。统一了全国财政经济工作的管理和领导，争取了财政收支的平衡，实现了金融物价的稳定；调整了工商业，改善了公私关系和劳资关系；进行了救灾工作和水利工作，保证了农业生产的丰收。这一切使财政经济的基本好转有了良好的开端。
    人民政府忠实执行了正确的文化教育政策。推行了人民的政治学习运动，使广大的知识分子和青年学生参加了新知识的学习，或者参加革命工作。人民政府并有重点的开展了工农教育，注意了国民卫生。这一切使广大的文教战线呈现新的气象。
    人民政府忠实执行了正确的民族政策。各民族在中华人民共和国的大家庭中，逐渐消逝了过去的隔阂，踏上了友爱合作的光明大道。在中国历史上，各民族与全体人民从来没有像现在这样亲密地团结。
    人民政府忠实执行了正确的外交政策。我国已经和苏联、各新民主主义国家以及若干资本主义国家建立了外交关系。我们对保卫世界和平反对侵略战争尽了应尽的责任，受到国际友人的一致赞扬。在中国历史上，我们的国际地位，从来没有像现在这样真正的提高。
    人民作了主人，建设了自己的国家。一年来人民政府所作的工作，都是适合于新中国建设的进程，符合于全国人民利益的。
    不过究竟还仅是短短的一年。
    新国家的工作还都在开创，还都在发展。全国人民对于自己的革命事业，还须在胜利的基础上开展伟大的斗争，还须继续巩固人民民主专政。
    一方面，全国人民在各个工作战线上开展真正人民革命的伟大斗争；另方面，人民政府又适时而正确的总结各方面工作的经验，规定新的工作方针。毛主席领导我们这样做了，我们取得了胜利。我们要在胜利的基础上继续巩固胜利，继续巩固人民民主专政，就必须继续学习。学习掌握毛泽东思想，学习毛主席怎样运用马克思列宁主义的普遍真理来具体指导中国革命的实际，学习他谆谆告诫我们的许多宝贵的革命经验。
    现在我们第一次庆祝伟大的国庆日，应当学习那些经验呢？我们应当学习毛主席在《论人民民主专政》一文中所总结的中国革命基本的和主要的两条经验：“（一）在国内，唤起民众。这就是团结工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级，在工人阶级领导之下，结成国内的统一战线，并由此发展到达建立工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政国家；（二）在国外，联合世界上以平等待我之民族及各国人民，共同奋斗。这就是联合苏联、联合各新民主主义国家、联合其他各国的无产阶级及广大人民，结成国际的统一战线。”
    这是中国人民达到胜利的两条基本经验，也是中国人民巩固胜利的两条基本经验。
    “在国内，唤起民众”。中国人民遵循着这条经验，奋斗的结果，实现了革命的大团结，建立了人民民主专政的国家。全国人民在共同纲领的基础上坚固地团结起来了。这一胜利的经验，已经逐渐推广到各级人民代表会议中，也逐渐推广到调整工商业的工作中，也开始推广到其他工作中。在许多方面，是认真的做了。人民政府的一切政策，一切决议，不仅在制订时必须是集中了人民内部的正确意见，而且在贯彻与执行时，更须动员与组织人民的力量来共同努力。因为任何一项工作，都是人民革命事业的一部分，都包括对于人民内部实行民主和对于人民敌人实行专政的两个方面。“唤起民众”，就是教育人民在具体行动中分清自己和敌人的界限，以便分别采用民主或专政的方法，团结自己，战胜敌人。这一经验，对于当前的土地改革工作，对于人民政府的干部和领导国家政权的工人阶级，更有重要的意义。在土改工作中，我们必须善于教育与组织农民团结一切反对封建的力量，与地主阶级进行斗争，消灭封建的土地制度。在其他工作中，我们必须清醒地分清敌友，善于使用批评与自我批评的方法来教育自己，坚决反对使用命令主义和强迫的方法去对待人民，要更好地团结各民族和全体人民为新国家的建设事业而斗争。
    “在国外，联合世界上以平等待我之民族及各国人民，共同奋斗”。中国人民遵循着这条经验，在建国之初，即坚固地和世界和平堡垒苏联团结在一起，并和苏联签订了中苏友好同盟互助条约，同时也坚固地团结各新民主主义国家以及全世界一切和平民主力量，共同倒向社会主义的一边。
    现在的世界，有两个阵营，两条道路。以美国帝国主义为首的侵略阵营，妄想挑起世界大战，以满足它们统治世界的欲望。这是战争的道路，是违犯全人类意志的。以苏联为首的和平阵营，则努力发展世界民主力量，坚决保卫和平，制止战争危险。这是和平的道路，是代表全人类意志的。中国人民依照全人类和自己的愿望，毫不动摇地选择了和平的道路。中国人民的事业，早已是世界人民事业的一部分了。
    我们要巩固人民民主专政，就要保卫世界的持久和平。现在，全世界的人民正在蓬蓬勃勃地开展和平签名运动，勇敢勤劳与深爱和平的中国人民正千百万地卷入这个斗争，这是我们加强国际统一战线力量的一个重大贡献，我们必须充分发挥出来。
    我们要保卫世界的持久和平，就要粉碎美国帝国主义的侵略行为。现在，美国帝国主义正疯狂地武装干涉朝鲜，侵略台湾、越南和菲律宾等地，美国已经露骨地暴露了干涉亚洲事务的野心。全国人民必须万众一心，与东方各民族一致奋起，在国际和平民主阵线中，百倍努力，为粉碎美国帝国主义的侵略暴行而奋斗到底。
    努力发挥我们的伟大力量，继续巩固我们的人民民主专政。让我们在光荣的日子里高呼中华人民共和国万岁！我们人民伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
