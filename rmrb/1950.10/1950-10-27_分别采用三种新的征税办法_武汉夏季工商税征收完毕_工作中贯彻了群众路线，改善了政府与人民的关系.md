Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 25th: The Wuhan Municipal People's Government Taxation Bureau has successfully completed the collection of summer industrial and commercial taxes due to the correct implementation of the resolution on tax adjustment of the Second National Tax Conference, and has been commended by the Central South District Taxation Administration.

The Wuhan Municipal Taxation Bureau adopted three methods simultaneously for the collection of this summer's industrial and commercial tax: "self-reporting and account checking," "democratic appraisal," and "fixed period and fixed amount." In the democratic appraisal, the Municipal Taxation Bureau relied on the masses to implement the method of first appraising the business volume and then calculating and collecting taxes according to the rate based on the business volume. This changed the past practice of the Taxation Bureau handling tax affairs alone and the appraisal method of only appraising tasks but not appraising business volume, thus avoiding the phenomenon of excessively heavy or light burdens.

Before the collection of this summer's industrial and commercial tax, the Wuhan Municipal Taxation Bureau made thorough preparations. First, according to the soundness of the industrial and commercial account books and the strength of the tax bureau itself, the city's industries and businesses were divided into three major categories and taxed according to different collection methods. 150 households were taxed using the method of "self-reporting, account checking, and tax calculation according to the rate"; 25,000 households were taxed using the method of fixed period and fixed amount on the basis of self-reporting and public discussion; and approximately 4,000 households were taxed using the method of "democratic appraisal." The tax burden of industrial and commercial households implementing democratic appraisal accounted for more than 50% of the city's industrial and commercial tax. Therefore, the Wuhan Municipal Taxation Bureau concentrated its main efforts on the "democratic appraisal" work. Secondly, the Taxation Bureau repeatedly exchanged opinions with taxpayers on the new tax collection methods for this summer's industrial and commercial tax. In mid-July, an industrial and commercial tax professional conference was held, including representatives from the Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee and sixteen major industries. At the meeting, it was unanimously decided that under the direct guidance of the Municipal Taxation Bureau and the Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee, each industry should form a tax assessment committee composed of both labor and capital and several mutual account checking groups. Through the publicity and explanation of the meeting, the new tax policy and methods were enthusiastically supported by taxpayers. In addition, the Taxation Bureau also absorbed 384 legitimate industrialists and businessmen and 531 shop employees and workers to assist the Taxation Bureau in handling tax work.

After each industry reported its business volume, the Taxation Bureau relied on shop employees and workers and legitimate industrialists and businessmen to conduct mutual investigation and appraisal, constantly exposing the false account behavior of illegal merchants, so that the business volume reported by each industry and household gradually approached the truth. This measure was one of the basic keys to making the tax burden of each household in the same industry tend to be fair and reasonable. After mutual investigation and appraisal, the total business volume of the city's fifty industries participating in the democratic appraisal increased by 5.4% compared to the self-reported business volume, and some individual industries increased by 35%.

After the mutual investigation and appraisal, the Taxation Bureau conducted sample checks, consultations, and re-evaluations. The sample check was conducted in the same industry in three grades and nine levels according to the size of the business. The purpose was for the Taxation Bureau to measure the authenticity of the mutual investigation and appraisal based on the information it possessed. The consultation was to take care of the specific circumstances of each industry and prevent possible deviations in the sample check calculation. During the re-evaluation, the final evaluation was made separately according to the truthfulness of the self-reported business volume of the sampled and unsampled households in the same industry. In this stage of work, because the Taxation Bureau had conducted investigations and research in advance and mastered the information, it exposed many tax-evading merchants, so after the re-evaluation, the phenomenon of unfair tax burden between households was further eliminated. When assessing the tax amount, the total business volume increased by 10% compared to the final self-reported figure.

In the Wuhan City Summer Industrial and Commercial Tax collection work, because tax collectors and taxpayers jointly handled tax affairs, the responsibility and enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen to pay taxes were strengthened, so the relationship between tax collectors and taxpayers has been basically improved. Some industrialists and businessmen said: "The tax bureau has a democratic style and collects taxes fairly. Only by honestly paying taxes can industrialists and businessmen be worthy of the people's own government today." Some industries also launched competitions to pay taxes in advance. Through this industrial and commercial tax collection work, Wuhan City tax cadres have ideologically attached importance to the power of the masses and overcome the bureaucratic and commandist style in their work.

　　分别采用三种新的征税办法
    武汉夏季工商税征收完毕
    工作中贯彻了群众路线，改善了政府与人民的关系
    【新华社汉口二十五日电】武汉市人民政府税务局由于正确贯彻二届全国税务会议关于调整税收的决议，已胜利完成夏季工商业税的征收工作，并获得中南区税务管理局的表扬。
    武汉市税务局征收此次夏季工商业税是采取“自报查账”、“民主评议”、“定期定额”三种方式同时进行的。在民主评议中，市税务局依靠群众，实行首先评定营业额，然后根据营业额依率计征的方法，改变了过去实行的税务局单独办税与只评任务、不评营业额的评议方法，因此避免了负担上畸重畸轻的现象。
    在此次夏季工商业税征收前，武汉市税务局曾作了周密的准备工作。首先根据工商业账册的健全程度与税局本身的力量，将全市工商业分成三大类，按不同征收方式收税。计采用“自报查账，依率计征”方式征收的一百五十户；在自报公议基础上，采取定期定额方式征收的二万五千户；采用“民主评议”方式征收的约四千余户。实行民主评议的工商业户的税负占全市工商业税的百分之五十以上。因此武汉市税务局便把主要力量集中于“民主评议”工作。其次，税务局与纳税人反复交换关于这次夏季工商业税的新的征收方法的意见。在七月中旬召开了包括工商联合会筹备会和十六个主要行业代表参加的工商业税专业会议。会上一致决定：在市税务局和工商联合筹备会直接指导下，各业由劳资双方组成评税委员会和若干互相查账的互查小组。通过会议的宣传和解释，新的税收政策和方法步骤得到纳税人的热烈拥护。此外，税务局并吸收了三百八十四个正当工商业者和五百三十一个店员、工人协助税务局办理税收工作。
    在各行业自报营业额以后，税务局便依靠店员工人和正当工商业者进行互查互评工作，不断揭露不法商人的假账虚账行为，使各业各户自报的营业额逐渐接近真实。这一措施是使同业间各户的税负趋向公平合理的基本关键之一。经互查互评后，全市五十个参加民主评议的行业的总营业额比自报的营业额增加了百分之五点四，有个别行业增加百分之三十五。
    在互查互评后，税务局便进行抽查、协商和复评的工作。抽查是在同一行业内按营业大小分成三等九级进行的，其目的是税务局根据本身掌握的资料来测量互查互评的真实程度。协商是为了照顾各业的具体情况，防止抽查计算中可能发生的偏差。复评时，根据同一行业内已抽查户和未抽查户自报营业额的虚实情况分别作最后的评定。在这一阶段的工作中，由于税务局事先作了调查研究，掌握了资料，揭露了不少偷税商户，因此，在复评之后，户与户之间的税负不公现象得到进一步的消除。在核定税款时，全体总营业额比最后自报的数字增加了百分之十。
    此次武汉市夏季工商业税征收工作中，由于收税人和纳税人共同办税，加强了工商业者纳税的责任感和积极性，因此收税人和纳税人之间的关系已基本上改善。有的工商业者说：“税局作风民主，收税公平，工商业者只有老实纳税，才对得起今天人民自己的政府。”有的行业还展开了提前缴纳税款竞赛。经过这次工商业税的征收工作，武汉市税务干部从思想上重视了群众的力量，克服工作中的官僚主义和命令主义的作风。
