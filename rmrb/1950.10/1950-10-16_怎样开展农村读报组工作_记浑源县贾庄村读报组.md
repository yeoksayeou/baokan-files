How to Develop Rural Newspaper Reading Group Work
    A Record of the Jia Village Newspaper Reading Group in Hunyuan County
    Guo Zhu

The newspaper reading group in Jia Village, Hunyuan Seventh District, Chahar Province, has become a mass newspaper reading organization enthusiastically supported and participated in by the masses after more than ten months of effort. As early as last winter, literate people in the village often went to school to read newspapers, and later winter schools also combined with newspaper reading. During the love-newspaper campaign in January this year, the newspaper reading group was formally established. Therefore, the newspaper reading group in the village was conceived in the winter school and generated by the needs of the masses. By the spring ploughing season, the newspaper reading group began to consolidate and achieved great development.

When the newspaper reading group was first established, there were only three people: Branch Secretary Yang Shupu, County Representative Yuan Zhao, and Village Cadre Chen Jianguo. Later, Village Chief Li Chunjin, the village postman, and the branch's propaganda and cultural education committee members also joined. In addition to reading newspapers themselves and explaining them to the masses, they also wrote articles for the newspaper. According to statistics from August and September, the three correspondents of the newspaper reading group wrote nine articles. Although only one of their articles was adopted, their enthusiasm did not diminish. As Chen Jianguo, the head of the newspaper reading group's correspondence group, said: "It doesn't matter whether it's published or not. Our main purpose is to reflect our work and practice writing." The village representatives also often urged them to write more about the village's situation. They all promised: "In the future, no matter what achievements or shortcomings the village has, we will write articles and send them to the newspaper."

So, what exactly did this newspaper reading group do, and what experiences did it gain?

    (1) Reading newspapers is closely integrated with the central work. When reading newspapers, they mainly read agricultural production knowledge and scientific knowledge in the newspapers, and promoted them. For example, after they read the newspaper's introduction to the seed soaking method, they promoted it to the masses, dispelling the masses' concerns about scalding the seeds, so that everyone automatically soaked the seeds, which greatly reduced the phenomenon of mold disease in this year's naked oats. Therefore, everyone happily said: "No one explained it before, but now it's great!" They constantly came to the newspaper reading group for help. Especially in April this year, the newspaper reading group took on a major task. At that time, the village representative meeting decided to open a canal, but some people were worried about digging off the "earth dragon vein," which hindered the progress of the work. Therefore, the newspaper reading group read some anti-superstition materials to everyone, such as "Yiguandao Deceives People" and "Believing in Gods and Ghosts Kills People," clearing their superstitious thoughts and mobilizing more than 300 people to participate in the work. At the same time, in the canal opening work, the newspaper reading group used rest time to read stories of model workers to everyone, greatly increasing everyone's enthusiasm. Many people said: "The newspaper publishes news of construction everywhere, building railways, building new houses, and opening mines. Our efforts to open canals are also participating in construction, let's work hard." In just over 20 days, they opened a large canal more than 1,350 zhang long, which irrigated 25.6 mu of land in the summer. If there is a drought next spring, half of the village's land (more than 50 mu) will be guaranteed. In addition, the newspaper reading group also used newspapers to promote the guidance of field seed selection, the organization of autumn protection work, and the leadership of autumn harvest and autumn planting in advance, so they all went smoothly. Of the 397 households in the village, 321 households conducted field selection, and implemented harvesting and plowing at the same time. In more than 20 days, the village plowed 4,866 mu of land, accounting for 48% of the total land.

    (2) Actively publicize policies and explain current events. After they read to the masses the government's decree to resolutely protect the people's property, the masses' enthusiasm for production was greatly improved, eliminating the concerns of many people about re-division and re-"struggle" in the past. For example, the middle peasant Yu Hai originally had a negative attitude towards production and threw away his manure-collecting basket. But after listening to the newspaper reading several times, he bought more than 640 jin of hemp bran this spring and applied it to the land. After everyone heard the People's Daily editorial on July 10th, "Strive for the Prosperity of the Lives of Farmers in North China," even Yu Xiuming, who was famous for his laziness, bought livestock and repaired a large cart. Everyone worked hard to cultivate crops, and worked hard to cultivate crops, moving towards the road of restoring production and living a good life. It is calculated that the average amount of fertilizer increased by 1.5 dan per mu this year. The village increased livestock by 30 heads, newly made 7 iron plows, 160 iron shovels, 40 iron grabs, 22 iron harrows, more than 300 hoe blades, more than 300 sickles, 14 grass-cutting knives, and repaired 5 large carts. Everyone said: "The Communist Party and the People's Government are really thinking about the people, afraid that we will have a bad life!" After the newspaper reading group read the experience of organizing labor exchange groups in other places, the village expanded from the original six labor exchange groups to fourteen, and persisted until the autumn harvest and autumn planting. The masses often said to the people in the newspaper reading group: "Come, pick a section and read it!"

    The newspaper reading group has also achieved good results in the propaganda of the Marriage Law. For example, Yu Yuezhi's parents arranged Yu Yuezhi's marriage and wanted her to marry Hao Yinguan, a loafer from Tuofeng Village. After she listened to the newspaper reading, she resolutely filed for divorce. Pei Yuzhi's parents wanted to ask the man for three stones of yellow rice and fifty yuan of silver, and Pei Yuzhi strongly opposed it. Now, when women in the village get married, they rarely ask for money. At the same time, the women's awareness has also been greatly improved. All 238 women in the village with full labor force go to the fields like men. For example, Pei Lianzhi led 20 women to participate in digging ditches. Pei Yuzhi learned to use a large hoe to hoe the fields, and led 16 women to use large hoes. They all said: "We want to participate in labor. The newspaper often publishes that women participating in labor is glorious!"

    In addition, the masses also love to listen to current affairs news. For example, on September 18, more than 150 people listened to the comparison of the strength of the two camps and the news of the US imperialist conspiracy to threaten world peace. After the newspaper reading group explained the reason for the peace signature, 1,200 of the 1,441 people in the village automatically signed. In June and July, special agents created rumors to undermine production, and the masses were uneasy. The newspaper reading group read to the masses the case of Zhang City cracking down on the underground armed forces of bandits and special agents and special agents pretending to be white-haired ghosts, and the masses said: "There are no demons and ghosts there, they are all these bad guys and special agents making trouble." Everyone was vigilant and produced with peace of mind.

    (3) Use newspapers as the main material for educating militia cadres, and an effective tool for promoting guidance work and contacting the masses. Branch Secretary Yang Shupu said: "Since the newspaper reading group's work has been launched, the work in the village has been easier to lead and easier to do." For example, when opening canals, individual cadres said: "It's not for ourselves, why should we actively lead!" But after the education of the newspaper, they all realized their mistakes. Militia squad leader Wang Shuchen had a bad style, and was corrected after the education of the newspaper. He achieved excellent results in leading the militia to patrol and protect the autumn. They stipulate that they read the newspaper nine times a month in the cadre meeting. The branch also stipulates that they read the newspaper four times a month. Reading newspapers is mainly combined with ideological style and central work. For example, after they heard the People's Daily editorial on September 16, "Guarantee this year's autumn harvest and strive for more production next year," they all expressed their confidence in leading the masses to complete the autumn harvest and autumn planting. At the same time, the work ability and ideological level of the village cadres have also been improved with the strengthening of learning, and have been supported by the masses.

    (4) They read newspapers to the masses in three places where the masses often gather, according to the situation in the village. The time for reading newspapers is also not fixed, using various forms and various occasions. For example, when convening a production team meeting, they choose things that are closely related to the interests of the masses to read to the masses, aiming at the masses' thinking. Once, after they read the news of the county's Xinpei Village Chief leading the masses to produce, the masses felt it was very interesting. Sometimes they first select and read a few titles and brief content, ask the masses to choose themselves, and solicit the opinions of the masses. The comrades of the newspaper reading group are very patient in explaining the newspapers. Yang Fengcai said: "Listening to the newspaper often can understand what stage our country has reached." Because everyone knows: "What is said in the newspaper is all true people and true events, every sentence is the truth. I didn't know things before, but now I know them." They all automatically ask to listen to the newspaper.

The newspaper reading group not only reads newspapers, but also closely combines with the village's blackboard newspaper and broadcasting tube. When there are good materials, the newspaper reading group studies them first, and then writes them on the blackboard newspaper. For example, they praised Yang Fengcai, a military family member who actively opened canals, and Yu Erhe, a smoker who actively produced after being reformed, and criticized Pei Yinhai, a lazy man who did not do well in opening canals, which all played a great role.

　　怎样开展农村读报组工作
    记浑源县贾庄村读报组
    郭铸
    察哈尔省浑源七区贾庄村的读报组，经过了十多个月的努力，已成为群众热烈拥护与参加的群众性的读报组织了。该村远在去年冬季，群众中识字的就常到学校看报，后来冬学也结合着读报。今年一月间，该村开展爱报运动，便正式成立了读报组。因此，该村的读报组，就是孕育于冬学，而在群众的需求下产生的。到春耕时，读报组便开始巩固，并获得了很大的发展。
    该读报组在开始建立时，只有支书杨树普、县代表袁兆和村干陈建国三人，后来村长李春锦、村收发员和支部宣传、文教委员等也都参加了。他们除了自己读报和向群众讲解外，并给报社写稿。据八、九月份统计，读报组的三个通讯员就写了九篇稿子。虽然他们所写的稿子只被采用过一次，但他们的热情并未稍减。正如该读报组的通讯组长陈建国同志所说：“登或不登都不要紧，咱主要的目的便是为了反映工作和锻炼写稿。”村代表们也经常督促他们多写村里的情况。他们都保证说：“今后无论村里有啥成绩和缺点，咱们都要写稿子寄给报社。”
    那末，这个读报组究竟做了那些事情，和获得了那些经验呢？
    （一）读报与中心工作紧密结合。他们在读报时，主要是读报上的农业生产知识和科学知识，并予以推广。如他们读了报上介绍的浸种方法后，便向群众进行宣传，消除了群众怕烫死种子的顾虑，使大家自动地浸了种，使今年的莜麦大大减少了霉病的现象。因此，大家都欢喜地说：“从前没有人给讲解，现在可好啦！”都不断地来找读报组，请求帮助。特别是在今年四月间，读报组更顶了大事。当时，村代表会决定开渠，但部分群众却怕掘断“土龙脉”而怀疑顾虑，阻碍着工作的进展。于是，读报组便给大家读了一些反迷信的材料，如“一贯道骗人”和“信神信鬼害死人”等，廓清了他们的迷信思想，动员起三百多人参加工作。同时，在开渠工作中，读报组更利用休息时间，给大家读些劳动模范的故事，大大地提高了大家的积极性。不少群众说：“报纸上登着到处在建设的消息，修铁路呀，盖新房呀，开矿山呀。咱们努力开渠，也是参加了建设，好好干吧。”仅二十多天，他们就开了一道一千三百五十多丈长的大渠，夏季浇了二十五顷六十亩地，假使明春天旱，全村半数土地（五十多顷）也有把握保苗了。此外，如田间选种的指导、护秋工作的组织、秋收秋耕的领导等，读报组都在事先利用报纸展开宣传，因之都进行得很顺利。全村三九七户，有三二一户进行了田选，实行了随割随耕、边收边打。二十多天，全村即耕地四千八百六十六亩，占全部土地的百分之四十八。
    （二）积极宣传政策和讲解时事。他们向群众读了政府坚决保护人民财产的法令后，群众生产情绪都大为提高，使不少人都消除了过去怕再分、怕再“斗”的顾虑。如中农于海，原先对生产抱着消极态度，把拾粪筐子也扔掉了。但他听了几次读报，今春就买了六百四十多斤麻糁上了地。大家听了七月十日人民日报“为华北农民生活的富裕而奋斗”的社论后，连以懒惰出名的于秀明也买了牲口，修起大车。大家都精耕细作，辛勤培植庄稼，向着恢复生产、过好光景的道路迈进。计算今年该村每亩地平均增肥一担半。全村增加牲畜三十头，新打铁犁七张、铁锹一百六十张、铁抓子四十个、铁钯子二十二个、锄片三百多个、镰刀三百多把、铡草刀十四口，修复大车五辆。大家说：“共产党、人民政府真是为人民打算，怕咱光景过错！”读报组向大家读了别地组织拨工组的经验后，全村便从原有的六个拨工组扩展了十四个，并且一直坚持到秋收秋耕。群众不时对读报组的人说：“来，摘一段读读！”
    在关于婚姻法的宣传上，读报组也收到了很好的效果。如于月芝的父母包办于月芝的婚姻，要她与驼峰村二流子郝印官订婚。她听了读报后便坚决提出离婚。裴玉枝的父母要向男方索取三石黄米、五十元白洋，裴玉枝便竭力反对。现在该村妇女结婚，都已很少要钱了。同时，妇女们的觉悟也有了极大提高，全村二百三十八个有整个劳动力的妇女，都与男子同样下地。如裴莲枝便带动过二十个妇女参加掘渠。裴玉枝学会了用大锄锄田，并带起十六个妇女使用大锄。她们都说：“咱们要参加劳动，报上常登着妇女参加劳动是光荣的！”
    此外，群众也很爱听时事消息。如在九月十八日就有一百五十多人，听了两个阵营力量的对比和美帝国主义威胁世界和平的阴谋的新闻。读报组讲清了和平签名的道理以后，全村一千四百四十一人中就有一千二百人自动地签了名。在六、七月间，特务造谣破坏生产、群众情绪不安。读报组即把张市破获匪特地下武装的案件和特务假装白毛鬼等新闻，向群众念了一下，群众便说：“那里有什么妖魔鬼怪，尽是这些坏家伙特务捣乱。”大家便严密防范，安心生产了。
    （三）把报纸当做教育民兵干部的主要材料，和推动指导工作、联系群众的有效工具。支书杨树普说：“自读报组工作展开以后，村里的工作就好领导、好做得多了。”如开渠时有个别干部说：“又不是为了咱自己，何必积极领导！”但经过报纸的教育以后，都认识了自己的错误。民兵班长王守臣作风不好，也是经报纸教育后才纠正过来的，他在领导民兵巡逻护秋中获得优良成绩。他们规定每月在干部会上读报九次。支部也规定每月读四次。读报主要是结合思想作风和中心工作。如他们听了九月十六日人民日报社论“保证今年秋季丰收争取明年更多增产”后，都表示有信心领导群众完成秋收秋耕。同时，村干部的工作能力和思想水平也随着学习的加强而提高，得到了群众拥护。
    （四）他们根据村里情况，分别在三个群众常聚集的地方给群众读报。读报的时间也不固定，利用各种形式、各种场合。如召开生产小组会时，就针对群众的思想，选择与群众切身利益有关的事念给群众听。有一次，他们读了本县新裴村长领导群众生产的消息后，群众便觉得怪有意思。有时他们先选读几个标题和简要内容，叫群众自己选择，征求群众意见。读报组的同志对报纸的讲解都非常耐心。杨凤才说：“常听报，能了解咱们国家究竟到了什么地步。”因大家都知道：“报纸上说的都是真人真事，句句是实话。以前不知道的事，现在也知道了。”都自动要求听报。
    读报组不光是进行读报，并且与村里的黑板报、广播筒密切结合起来。有了好的材料，读报组先加研究，然后写出来在黑板报上发表。如他们表扬了积极开渠的军属杨凤才和经改造后积极生产的烟民于二和，批评了开渠不力的懒汉裴银海，都发挥了很大的作用。
