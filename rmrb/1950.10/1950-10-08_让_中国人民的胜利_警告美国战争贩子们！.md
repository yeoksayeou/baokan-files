　　Let "The Victory of the Chinese People" Warn the American Warmongers!
    Zhang Zhi

    After seeing "The Victory of the Chinese People," I was so excited, so excited that I just wanted to shout: Ah, our motherland!
    Our motherland is lovable. The land is so vast, the mountains and rivers are so beautiful, the products are so rich, and the people are so simple, hardworking, and brave. The mighty Yellow River, the rolling Yangtze River, endless mineral resources, priceless ancient art treasures... Everything is strength, is beauty, is the solemnity of an ancient country that nurtures heroes and models. But under the long-term oppression and exploitation of feudalism and imperialism, our nation has suffered profound disasters, and the broad masses of the people have been struggling in a sea of ​​suffering. How much bitterness and tears, how much humiliation and hatred, how much hard struggle and sacrifice! And today, we finally stand tall, standing on the peak of victory! The eyes of the whole world have seen the heroic spirit of the Chinese nation, as majestic as mountains. They have seen the inviolable dignity of the Chinese people, tempered in a hundred battles. Our struggles and victories have shaken the world!
    Our struggles and victories are inseparable from the struggles and victories of the people of the world. Our struggles and victories will be written in the history of mankind together with the struggles and victories of the Russian October Revolution, the struggles and victories of various new democratic countries, and the struggles and victories of all oppressed nations and oppressed people!
    Our struggles and victories are inseparable from the banner of Mao Zedong. From Jinggangshan to Ruijin, from Ruijin to Yan'an, from Yan'an to Beijing—on every road to victory, the great banner of Mao Zedong flutters. Thousands upon thousands of men and women gathered from all directions, stepping over snow-capped mountains and grasslands, climbing cliffs and precipices, crossing great rivers and great rivers, unafraid of cold, unafraid of heat, unafraid of hunger, unafraid of fatigue, and always following this banner. No matter the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, no matter Japanese imperialism, no matter American imperialism, no matter prisons, butcher knives, gallows, airplanes, warships, artillery, secret agents, silent pistols... none of them can stop this banner from leading the broad masses of the people to continue to advance. The Chinese people have been following this banner to the victory of today, and will continue to follow it forever!
    Look: The victorious Chinese people are flowing endlessly in front of Tiananmen Square in the capital, frantically cheering for their leader. Look: American submachine guns, American light and heavy machine guns, American artillery and tanks... The warmongers will tremble when they think about how these new weapons fell into the hands of the Chinese people!
    Does anyone still think that the Chinese people can be invaded and their fruits of victory can be taken away? Does anyone still think that the strength of the people of the world is inferior to the strength of imperialism and traitors? Does anyone still think that the Korean people cannot gain final victory from hard struggle? Please take a look at "The Victory of the Chinese People."
    Let "The Victory of the Chinese People" warn the American warmongers who are frantically provoking...

　　让“中国人民的胜利”警告美国战争贩子们！
    章直
    看了“中国人民的胜利”，我是那样的激动，激动得只想大喊：啊，我们的祖国！
    我们的祖国是可爱的。土地是那样广大，山川是那样秀丽，物产是那样丰富，人民是那样朴实、勤劳、英勇。浩荡的黄河，滚滚的扬子江，无尽的矿藏，无价的古代艺术珍宝……。一切是力，是美，是抚育英雄模范的古国的庄严。可是在封建主义和帝国主义的长期压迫和剥削下，我们的民族遭受了深重的灾难，广大的人民一直在苦海中挣扎着。多少辛酸和血泪，多少屈辱和仇恨，多少苦斗和牺牲！而今天，我们终于挺立起来了，挺立在胜利的高峰！全世界的眼睛都看见了中华民族的巍如山岳的英雄气概。看见了百炼成钢的中国人民的不可侵犯的尊严。我们的战斗和胜利震动了世界！
    我们的战斗和胜利是与全世界人民的战斗和胜利分不开的。我们的战斗和胜利，将跟俄国十月革命的战斗和胜利、各新民主主义国家的战斗和胜利、以及一切被压迫民族、被压迫人民的战斗和胜利，一同写在人类的历史上！
    我们的战斗和胜利是与毛泽东的旗帜分不开的。从井岗山到瑞金，从瑞金到延安，从延安到北京——每一条胜利的道路上，都飘扬着毛泽东的大旗。成千成万的男男女女，从四面八方汇集拢来，踏过雪山草地，爬过悬崖绝壁，渡过大河大江，不怕冷，不怕热，不怕饿，不怕疲劳，一直跟着这面旗子走。无论蒋介石匪帮，无论日本帝国主义，无论美帝国主义，无论监狱、屠刀、绞架、飞机、兵舰、大炮、特务、无声手枪……都挡不住这面旗子领着广大人民不断前进。中国人民一直跟着这面旗子走到胜利的今天，而且还要永远跟着它走！
    看吧：胜利后的中国人民，川流不息地涌过首都天安门前，向自己的领袖狂热地欢呼。看吧：美国的冲锋枪，美国的轻重机枪，美国的大炮和坦克……战争贩子们只要想一想这些新式武器是怎样落到中国人民手里的，就会发起抖来吧！
    还有谁以为中国人民可以侵犯、可以夺取其胜利果实吗？还有谁以为全世界人民的力量比不上帝国主义和卖国贼的力量吗？还有谁以为朝鲜人民不能从艰苦奋斗中获得最后胜利吗？请看看“中国人民的胜利”吧。
    让“中国人民的胜利”警告正在疯狂挑衅的美国战争贩子们……。
