Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 14th: Since August, new cotton from Shaanxi Province has been entering the market successively, and the Northwest District Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation has begun large-scale purchases.

Under the people's government's policy of rewarding cotton planting, the cotton planting area in Shaanxi Province this year has increased by 598,000 mu compared to last year's 2.8 million mu. The cotton yield is sufficient to supply the Northwest region's textile needs and civilian use, with surplus cotton for export. In order to supply industrial cotton in a planned manner and take care of the interests of cotton farmers, the state-owned Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation has not only set up cotton purchasing agencies in various cotton-producing areas of Shaanxi Province, but also entrusted private cotton firms to handle purchases on its behalf to facilitate cotton farmers' sales. At the same time, the Northwest District Company of the China National Grain Corporation transported a large amount of grain to the cotton-producing areas, so that cotton farmers could exchange grain at reasonable prices after selling their new cotton. The cotton purchase price is based on the instructions of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government regarding the cotton-wheat price ratio, dividing cotton into five grades and eight levels, with an average of about eight catties of wheat per catty of cotton. All purchasing units are equipped with cotton standards issued by the Northwest District Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation for cotton farmers to refer to and compare, and are also equipped with 120 technical personnel to identify cotton quality, so that grading and pricing are fair and reasonable.

Since a joint public-private cotton purchasing organization has not yet been established to carry out planned and unified purchasing work, some cotton markets in Shaanxi Province have experienced blind competitive buying; at the same time, some cotton peddlers have gone to the countryside to blackmail cotton farmers, or added water and sand to the cotton. These are all problems that relevant departments in Shaanxi Province urgently need to solve.

　　西北国营公司购棉工作准备较好
    评级作价达到公平合理
    尚须成立公私联购组织以免争购
    【新华社西安十四日电】陕西省新棉自八月份以来已陆续上市，中国花纱布公司西北区公司已开始大量收购。
    在人民政府的奖励植棉政策下，今年陕西省植棉面积比去年的二百八十万亩增加了五十九万八千亩。棉花产量除足够供给西北区纺织用棉和民用外，尚有余棉外销。为了有计划地供应工业用棉和照顾棉农利益，国营花纱布公司除在陕西省各产棉区设立收花机构外，并在各地委托私营花行办理代收，以便利棉农出售棉花。与此同时，中国粮食公司西北区公司运销了大批粮食至产棉区，使棉农在售出新棉以后能够以合理价格换回粮食。收棉价格系按照中央人民政府贸易部棉麦比价的指示，将棉花分为五等八级，平均每斤棉花约合小麦八斤左右。各个收购单位都备有中国花纱布公司西北区公司发给的棉花标准，以供棉农参考比较，另外并配备有一百二十名鉴别棉花质量的技术人员，使评级作价达到公平合理。
    由于至今尚未成立公私联合购棉组织，进行有计划的统一收购工作，陕西省某些棉花市场曾发生了盲目争购现象；同时也发生某些花贩下乡敲诈棉农，或在棉花中搀水搀沙的情形。这些都是陕西省有关部门所亟需解决的问题。
