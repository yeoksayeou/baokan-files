　　Learn from the Soviet Union and Continue to Develop Sino-Soviet Friendly Cooperation
　　Lin Boqu
　　Since the victory of the October Revolution, the Soviet people have extended the hand of great friendship to the Chinese people. However, imperialism and the reactionary Chinese government have always tried their best to obstruct and sabotage this, placing the development of friendship between the two peoples in extremely difficult conditions. Because the Chinese people overthrew the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, aided by American imperialism, and established the People's Republic of China, it has created fully free conditions for friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet peoples.
　　The Soviet people's love for the Chinese people is inseparable from the leadership of Lenin and Stalin. Lenin said in 1923: "The outcome of the struggle between the capitalist and communist worlds will ultimately depend on the fact that Russia, India and China, which account for the vast majority of the world's population, are being drawn into the struggle for liberation at a very rapid rate." Stalin also pointed out as early as 1925 that: "The driving force of the Chinese revolution is immeasurable. This force has not yet made itself properly felt. But they will certainly make themselves felt in the future. The rulers of the East and the West who fail to see this force and fail to give it due consideration will suffer greatly as a result." Lenin's and Stalin's predictions have been illustrated by historical reality.
　　Chairman Mao has constantly pointed out the great role of the victory of the Russian October Revolution in the world and the Chinese revolution. He told us in 1939: "Only socialist countries, socialist leaders, socialist people, socialist thinkers, politicians, and workers are truly assisting us in the cause of liberation of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people; and our cause cannot achieve final victory without their assistance."
　　Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have combined the profound friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people with their own cause of liberation, and are no longer isolated.
　　The victory of the Chinese people's great revolution and Chairman Mao's visit to the Soviet Union have brought Sino-Soviet relations into a new stage.
　　The facts of Sino-Soviet foreign policy over the past year have proved that the development of Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation has given great help to the people of both countries, especially the Chinese people, in national construction and economic and cultural life. This is because the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is based on the fundamental interests of the two peoples. At the same time, the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union has greatly strengthened the world's forces for peace and democracy, and has greatly encouraged the oppressed nations and working people of the world, especially the oppressed nations and working people of the East. This is because the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is based on the common highest ideals of the two peoples and is in line with the greatest interests of all mankind.
　　We thank the Soviet people for their great righteousness to the Chinese people, we cherish the deep friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, and we must fully understand the interests of Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation and its far-reaching significance for mankind. We must also learn from the Soviet Union. Learn from the Soviet Union's construction experience, learn from the Soviet Union's experience in uniting all ethnic groups and all people under the Soviet regime, and carry forward the spirit of internationalism.
　　After the victory of the Soviet revolution, the grandeur of its national construction and the richness of its construction experience shone with unprecedented brilliance throughout the world, pointing out the road to brightness and happiness for all people's democratic countries and the people of the world. Just as the Soviet Union has twice encountered the transition from war to peaceful construction in the process of its socialist construction, it has provided us with extensive experience for restoring and developing production. Today our task is to fight for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation. We should recognize the importance of this task, learn from the Soviet Union's construction experience and combine it with China's reality, and push China's construction cause forward.
　　The strong unity of all ethnic groups and all people in the Soviet Union under the Soviet regime has enabled the people of all ethnic groups to achieve unprecedented development in their political, economic and cultural affairs in the big family of the Soviets; it has enabled all the Soviet people to live under the leadership of their own country, living a happy life in which the system of exploitation has been eliminated and material and cultural life is improving day by day. And the unity and exertion of the strength of all ethnic groups and all people has created the prosperity and achievements of the socialist country in all aspects. Our Central People's Government has been established for a year, and local people's governments have also been established successively on the basis of convening people's representative conferences at all levels. This is the great democratic unity of all ethnic groups and people in China. We should recognize the importance of this unity, learn from the experience of the unity of all ethnic groups and all people in the Soviet Union, strengthen the people's democratic dictatorship, and consolidate and expand this great unity of the people of the whole country.
　　The Soviet Union is a socialist country and a bastion of world peace. The Soviet people are rich in the spirit of internationalism. Today, the central task of the people of the world is to oppose the aggression of imperialism headed by American imperialism, stop the danger of war, and strive for lasting and lasting peace. And to carry forward the spirit of internationalism is to learn from the Soviet Union, strengthen the great unity between China and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and unite with the proletariat and the broad masses of people in other countries, strive to develop the forces of peace and democracy, strive to oppose the war policy of American imperialism, and smash the aggressive actions of American imperialism.
　　If we cherish the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, we must continue to develop Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation and learn from the Soviet Union.

　　向苏联学习，继续发展中苏的友好合作
    林伯渠
    苏联人民，从十月革命胜利以后，即对中国人民伸出了伟大的友谊之手，但帝国主义和中国的反动政府，总是千方百计地阻挠破坏，使两国人民友谊的发展，处于极端困难的条件之下。由于中国人民推翻了美帝国主义所援助的国民党反动统治，建立了中华人民共和国，就给中苏两国人民的友好合作创造了充分自由的条件。
    苏联人民对中国人民的热爱，是同列宁和斯大林的领导分不开的。列宁在一九二三年曾说过：“资本主义与共产主义世界间斗争的结果，归根结蒂将取决于这样一个事实，即俄罗斯、印度与中国占世界人口的绝大多数正以非常速度卷入解放的斗争中。”斯大林也早于一九二五年就指出：“中国革命的动力是不可估量的。这种力量还没有能使自己确当地为人感觉出来。但是它们定会在将来使它自己被人感觉出来。看不到这种力量以及不给它们以应有估计的东方和西方的统治者们，将要因此吃大苦头。”列宁、斯大林的预见，业已由历史的现实所说明了。
    毛主席不断地指出了俄国十月革命的胜利，对于世界和中国革命的伟大作用。他在一九三九年这样告诉过我们：“中华民族与中国人民的解放事业，只有社会主义的国家，社会主义的领袖，社会主义的人民，社会主义的思想家、政治家、劳动者，才是真正援助我们的；而我们的事业，没有他们的援助是不能取得最后胜利的。”
    中国人民在毛主席领导下，把中苏两国人民的深厚友谊，同自己的解放事业结合在一起，就再也不是孤立的了。
    中国人民大革命的胜利和毛主席的访苏，使中苏两国关系进入新的阶段。
    一年来，中苏两国外交政策的事实证明，中苏友好合作的发展，已经给两国人民，特别给中国人民在国家建设和经济、文化生活上以很大帮助。这是因为中苏两国人民之间的友好合作，是建筑在两国人民的根本利益之上的。同时，中苏两国的友好合作，大大加强了世界和平民主力量，已经给全世界被压迫民族和劳动人民，特别是东方的被压迫民族和劳动人民以很大的鼓舞。这是因为中苏两国人民的友好合作，是基于两国人民有共同的最高理想，是符合于全人类的最大利益的。
    我们感谢苏联人民对于中国人民的伟大道义，我们珍贵中苏两大民族的深厚友谊，我们必须充分了解中苏友好合作的利益所在和它对于人类影响的深远意义。我们还必须向苏联学习。学习苏联的建设经验，学习苏联各民族与全体人民在苏维埃政权下团结的经验和发扬国际主义的精神。
    苏联革命胜利后，其建国规模的宏大和建设经验的丰富，是以史无前例的无比的光辉照耀着整个世界，指出了所有的人民民主国家和全世界人民走向光明幸福的大道。单就苏联在其社会主义建设的进程中曾两度遇到由战争转入和平建设的情况来说，就给我们为恢复和发展生产提供了广泛的经验。今天我们的任务是为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争。我们应当认清这个任务的重要性，学习苏联的建设经验并使之与中国的实际相结合，把中国的建设事业推向前进。
    苏联各民族与全体人民在苏维埃政权下的坚强团结，使各族人民在苏维埃的大家庭中，其政治、经济和文化都有了空前的发展；使苏维埃全体人民在自己的国家领导之下，过着消灭了剥削制度的和物质与文化日渐提高的幸福生活。而所有各民族与全体人民力量的团结与发挥，就创造了社会主义国家各方面的繁荣与成就。我们中央人民政府已经成立一年了，各地方人民政府在召开各界人民代表会议的基础上，也次第建立起来了，这是中国各民族和人民的民主大团结。我们应当认清这个团结的重要性，学习苏联各民族与全体人民团结的经验，加强人民民主专政，巩固和扩大这个全国人民的大团结。
    苏联是社会主义的国家，是世界和平的堡垒，苏联人民是富有国际主义精神的。今天全世界人民的中心任务，是反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义的侵略，制止战争危险，争取巩固的持久和平。而发扬国际主义的精神，就是向苏联学习，增强我们中国与苏联和各人民民主国家的大团结，并结合其他各国的无产阶级和广大人民，努力发展和平民主力量，努力反对美帝国主义的战争政策，粉碎美帝国主义的侵略行为。
    我们珍贵中苏人民的友谊就必须继续发展中苏友好合作，向苏联学习。
