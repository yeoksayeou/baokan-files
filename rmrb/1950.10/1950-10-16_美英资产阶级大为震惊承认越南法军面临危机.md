Xinhua News Agency, October 15th: TASS, New York, October 13th—The reactionary New York Times correspondent in Saigon, Baoding, admitted that due to the recent victories of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic People's Liberation Army, French imperialists in Indochina are encountering a serious crisis and facing a "bleak future." The reporter emphasized the strength displayed by the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army fighting between Gao Ping and Qixi, and admitted that the French army lost a large number of weapons and thousands of soldiers.

The American reporter had to admit that the unpopular Bao Dai regime is collapsing.

Xinhua News Agency, October 15th: According to Agence France-Presse, London, London's The Times admitted on the 13th, in its commentary on the Vietnam war situation, that the recent major defeat of the French army in North Vietnam also greatly shocked the British bourgeoisie. After describing the French army's disastrous defeat, the newspaper believed that the French army's failure "came too suddenly." The newspaper recalled that in February of this year, Britain and the United States recognized the Bao Dai puppet regime, at which time Britain and the United States announced their support for France's policy in Vietnam, and believed that France was "no longer alone." American aid has also increased "pleasant hopes." However, just when there were "great hopes, the hopes suddenly shattered. What the consequences will be for both France and Vietnam cannot be estimated at present." The newspaper pointed out that the reason why the British bourgeoisie is particularly alarmed is that "any setbacks suffered in Indochina will weaken the common front of the entire Southeast Asia."

The editorial published by the British Conservative Party's organ, The Daily Telegraph, on the 11th, also admitted that the failure of the French army caused "serious losses of personnel and prestige to the French and Vietnamese forces." The newspaper concluded that "the situation in Indochina, whether politically or militarily, is not pleasing to the French."

　　美英资产阶级大为震惊承认越南法军面临危机
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社纽约十三日讯：反动的纽约时报驻西贡记者宝丁承认：由于越南民主共和国人民解放军最近的胜利，法国帝国主义者在印度支那正遭遇到严重的危机，面临着“黯淡的前途”。该记者着重指出在高平和七溪之间作战的越南人民解放军所表现的力量，并承认：法军损失大批武器，损失兵力数千人。
    该美国记者不得不承认：不受人民欢迎的保大政权正在崩溃之中。
    【新华社十五日讯】据法新社伦敦讯，伦敦《泰晤士报》十三日在评论越南战局时承认：法军最近在北越的大败，也使英国资产阶级大为震惊。该报在叙述法军的惨败后，认为法军的失败“来得太突然”。该报追述今年二月间英国和美国曾承认保大傀儡政权，那时英国和美国宣布支持法国在越南的政策，并且认为法国已“不再是孤单的了。”美国的援助又增加了“可喜的希望”。但是，正在“大有希望的时候，希望突然破灭了。这对法越双方的后果如何，目前还不能估量”。该报指出：特别使英国资产阶级感到惊惶的原因是“在印度支那遭到的任何挫折，都要削弱整个东南亚的共同阵线”。
    英国保守党机关报《每日电讯》报十一日发表的社论，亦承认法军的失败，使“法越军队遭到人员和威信的严重损失”。该报结论认为，“印度支那无论在政治或军事方面的情况，都是对法国人不惬意的”。
