　　Integrating Three Methods to Deepen the Rectification Campaign in Pingyuan Province
    [Our Newspaper Dispatch] Reporter Shang Kai reports: The rectification movement in Pingyuan Province is continuing to develop in depth. The cadre rectification in the province is basically carried out through a combination of three methods: Party Representative Conferences and Cadre Rectification Meetings, Specialized Conferences, and On-the-Job Rectification. From July 25th to August 25th, the Provincial Party Committee first convened the Third Provincial Party Representative Conference to convey Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, summarize and review the work since the Second Party Representative Conference, and implement the spirit of rectification (see this newspaper's report on the Pingyuan Provincial Party Congress on September 16th for details). On September 11th, the Provincial Party Committee convened a provincial cadre rectification meeting for cadres above the county level to implement the spirit of the Third Party Representative Conference. Through studying Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and conducting in-depth reviews and summaries of work, the cadres' ideological and policy levels were improved. When studying the section on the situation in Chairman Mao's report, by connecting it with the activities of local special agents, secret societies, and landlords' revenge, and by examining the serious phenomena of cadres' coercive orders, violations of law and discipline, destruction of policies, and detachment from the masses, everyone realized the importance of uniting the majority and isolating the enemy in the current situation. This enhanced vigilance and shattered the complacency, arrogance, and paralysis that had grown among cadres in the wake of victory. When studying other parts of Chairman Mao's report, they also reviewed their work, criticized, and liquidated various incorrect viewpoints and work styles. At the same time as the provincial cadre rectification meeting, Party Representative Conferences of various district committees were also held, with the participation of main district-level cadres, to review the work of each district and cultivate district-level rectification backbones. Experience has proven that holding Party Representative Conferences or cadre meetings first to conduct rectification studies and focus on reviewing work is the best way to improve cadres' understanding of rectification, unify thinking, and cultivate rectification backbones. In Pingyuan Province, where the level of cadres at the county and district levels is generally low and there is a great deal of blindness in their work, it is especially necessary to hold large-scale meetings first for rectification and study. At the same time, the Provincial Party Committee or District Party Committees can also take this opportunity to widely listen to the opinions of lower levels, conduct self-criticism, solve problems, and improve leadership.
    On the basis of the Provincial Party Representative Conference and the cadre rectification meeting, the province successively convened various specialized conferences on industry, agriculture, water conservancy, urban areas, public security, cooperation, and finance. In accordance with the spirit of the Provincial Party Representative Conference, systematic reviews and summaries were conducted, and work was arranged. At the industry, agriculture, and urban conferences, agricultural socialist ideas and the tendency to blindly develop industry and utopianize the prosperity of cities were criticized, as well as the serious coercive and commanding work style in leading agricultural production. The working principles for small and medium-sized cities in the future were also determined, as well as the need to implement the spirit of rectification and transform work style in the Three Autumn Campaigns. In other specialized conferences, the main deviations in that work were reviewed, and future tasks and guidelines were determined. The experience of Pingyuan in holding various specialized conferences proves that this type of conference is a necessary step to guide the in-depth development of the rectification movement. Because Party Representative Conferences and cadre meetings can only review a few key policy issues in the province's implementation of the Party's general line and general policy, it is not yet possible to systematically solve the main problems in various tasks. Specialized conferences can further implement the spirit of rectification into various specialized businesses, solve the problems existing in various specialized business systems, and formulate concrete and feasible methods to improve work. At the same time, it proves that this type of specialized conference must be combined with the rectification of leading organs in order to help leading organs systematically understand the situation. The third step in the rectification campaign in Pingyuan Province is on-the-job rectification. Currently, the provincial cadre rectification meeting, various specialized conferences, and the Party Representative Conferences of various district committees have all concluded around the 15th. Cadres who participated in various conferences have returned to their respective work posts one after another. The Provincial Party Committee decided that cadres of leading organs in each county must conduct on-the-job rectification in conjunction with current work. Taking the cadres who participated in the rectification meeting as the core backbone, they will review work, improve their ideological and policy level, and set out practical and feasible methods to improve work and thoroughly transform their work style. Currently, in addition to the rectification of provincial-level organs, which is nearing completion, on-the-job rectification in various counties is about to begin comprehensively.

### 三种方式结合进行  平原整风逐步深入

　　三种方式结合进行
    平原整风逐步深入
    【本报讯】记者商恺报道：平原省整风运动正继续深入发展。该省干部整风，基本上是采取了党代表会议和干部整风会议、专业会议、在职整风三种方式结合进行的。七月二十五日至八月二十五日，省委首先召开了第三次省党代表会议，传达了毛主席三中全会报告，总结检查二次党代会以来的工作，贯彻整风精神（详见九月十六日本报平原省党代会消息）。九月十一日，省委又召开了全省县以上干部整风会议，以贯彻三次党代会精神。会议经过学习毛主席在三中全会的报告，深入检查与总结工作，使干部思想政策水平获得提高。在学习毛主席报告中的形势部分时，从联系本地特务、会门活动和地主倒算的情况，从检查干部强迫命令、违法犯纪、破坏政策脱离群众的严重现象，大家认识到目前形势下团结多数、孤立敌人的重要，提高了警惕，打破了干部在胜利形势下滋长着的居功自满、骄傲麻痹情绪。在学习毛主席报告中的其他部分时，也都结合检查工作，批判与清算了各种不正确的观点与作风。与全省干部整风会议同时召开的还有各地委的党代会议，参加者为区级主要干部检查各该专区的工作，培养区级整风骨干。经验证明：首先召开党代会或干部会，进行整风学习，有重点的检查工作，是提高干部对整风的认识，统一思想，培养整风骨干的最好方法。在平原省一般县、区级干部水平较低，工作中盲目性较大的情况下，首先召开大会进行整风学习，尤其需要。同时省委或地委，也可借此广泛听取下级意见，进行自我检讨，解决问题，改进领导。
    在省党代会和干部整风会的基础上，该省又先后召开了工业、农业、水利、城镇、公安、合作、财政等各种专业会议。根据省党代会的精神，有系统的进行检查总结与布置工作。在工业、农业与城镇会议中，批判了农业社会主义思想与盲目发展工业，空想繁荣城市的偏向，以及领导农业生产中的严重的强迫命令作风。并确定了今后中小城镇的工作方针，和在三秋工作中贯彻整风精神，转变工作作风。在其他几个专业会议中，也都分别检查了该项工作中的主要偏向，确定了今后的方针任务。平原召开各种专业会议的经验证明：此种会议，是引导整风运动深入发展的必要步骤。因为党代会与干部会，只能检查全省在执行党的总方针总路线中的几个政策性的关键问题，还不可能把各项工作中的主要问题系统的解决。而专业会议则能将整风精神进一步的贯彻到各个专门业务中去，解决各个专门业务系统中存在着的问题，制定具体的切实可行的改进工作的办法。同时证明：此种专业会议，必须与领导机关的整风结合进行，以便帮助领导机关系统的了解情况。平原省整风的第三个步骤是在职整风。目前全省干部整风会议、各专业会议，以及各地委党代会议，均于十五日前后相继结束。参加各种会议的干部，陆续返回各个工作岗位。省委决定各县领导机关干部，必须结合当前工作，进行在职整风。就以参加整风会议的干部为核心骨干，进行检查工作，提高思想政策水平，定出切实可行的改进工作的办法，彻底转变工作作风。目前除省级机关整风已接近结束外，各县在职整风即将全面开始。
