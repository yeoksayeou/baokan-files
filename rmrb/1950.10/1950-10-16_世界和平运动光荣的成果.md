　　Glorious Achievements of the World Peace Movement
    Chen Mingshu

    In 1936, I led the Chinese delegation, including Tao Xingzhi, Wang Lixi, and Zhu Jianghu, to participate in the World Peace Congress held in Brussels, Belgium. I put forward the basic demands of the Chinese people for world peace: internally, to overthrow the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek regime representing feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism; externally, to overthrow the imperialism that had oppressed the Chinese nation for over a century. In 1937, Japanese imperialism launched an aggression against China, and the entire Chinese people rose up to fight a life-and-death struggle against Japanese imperialism – the glorious and victorious War of Resistance Against Japan of the Chinese nation. In 1938, I arrived in Hankou and further developed the basic spirit of the international peace movement against aggression and imperialism. I united with progressive democratic figures in China to organize the China Anti-Aggression Branch of the International Peace Movement Congress, with myself and Shao Lizi serving as chairmen and Deng Feihuang serving as secretary-general, launching a broad and sustained anti-aggression movement. This gained the support and endorsement of the entire Chinese people. Unfortunately, it was later usurped by the reactionaries Song Ziwen, Li Shizeng, and his lackey Zheng Yanfen, who changed the nature of this anti-aggression movement and used it as a tool for propaganda for the reactionaries. Today, the global peace movement has unfolded comprehensively and grown persistently compared to 1936. The Chinese people's liberation movement, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, with the democratic united front of the entire Chinese people fighting the reactionaries for a long time, has also fundamentally achieved glorious, historic, and great victories, creating the fundamental conditions for the victory of the world's peace, democracy, and socialist movement. This is the glorious achievement of the world peace movement, and it is worthy of our commemoration.

　　世界和平运动光荣的成果
    陈铭枢
    我于一九三六年曾率领了中国代表团陶行知、王礼锡、朱江户等参加了在比利时不鲁塞尔举行的世界和平大会，曾提出了中国人民对于世界和平的基本要求：对内要推翻代表封建主义与官僚资本主义的反动的蒋介石政权，对外要打倒百余年来压迫中华民族的帝国主义。一九三七年日本帝国主义对中国发动侵略，中国全体人民起来与日本帝国主义作生死的斗争——中华民族光荣的胜利的抗日战争。我于一九三八年到了汉口，又将国际和平运动反侵略反帝国主义的基本精神发展起来，联合中国进步的民主人士组织了国际和平运动大会中国反侵略分会，推我和邵力子担任主席，邓飞黄担任秘书长，展开了广大的持久的反侵略运动。获得了全中国人民的支持与拥护，不幸后来为反动派的宋子文、李石曾和他的走狗郑彦棻所篡夺，改变了这个反侵略运动的本质，为反动派作宣传的工具了。今天，全世界的和平运动较之一九三六年已经全面地展开，持久地壮大起来了，中国人民的解放运动在中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下，全中国人民民主统一战线向反动派长期地斗争，也根本地获得了光荣的历史性的伟大的胜利，为全世界和平民主和社会主义运动创造了胜利的根本的条件。这就是世界和平运动光荣的成果，值得我们纪念的。
