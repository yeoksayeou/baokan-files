　　Facilitating Urban-Rural Material Exchange
    Beijing People's Bank Expands Scope of Telephone Transfers
    Since the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China established telephone transfers with Shanghai and other places, the industrial and commercial sectors have found it very convenient due to the rapid delivery and resolution. Now is the autumn harvest season, and urban-rural material exchanges are active. In order to facilitate the sales and transportation of public and private trade, further smooth the supply of industrial and agricultural products, and accelerate capital turnover, the bank has decided to continue expanding the scope of telephone transfers to meet customer needs. The advantages of telephone transfers are: (1) Speed: funds remitted in the morning can be delivered in the afternoon, and funds remitted in the afternoon can generally be used on the same day; (2) Low fees: each telephone transfer is charged at the standard rate for a single long-distance telephone call by the Telecommunications Bureau. For example, remitting to Shanghai via telegraph costs 57,600 yuan, while telephone transfer only costs 38,400 yuan.
    The locations where the bank's business department currently offers telephone transfer services are: Tianjin, Changxindian, Fengtai, Mentougou, Shijingshan, Tongxian, Zhuoxian, Langfang, Changping, (Nankou) Hangu, Tanggu, Baoding, Xiahuayuan, Xuanhua, Dingxian, Guye, Luanxian, Xugezhuang, Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, Qinhuangdao, Datong, Kouquan, Zhangbei, Xinji, Hengshui, Jinan, Shanghai, Handan, Anyang, Taiyuan, Qingdao, and other places. Other departments also have some telephone transfer services, and the locations for telephone transfers will be expanded soon.

　　便利城乡物资交流
    京人民银行扩大电话汇款范围
    人民银行北京分行自与上海等地建立电话汇款以来，因投解迅速，工商业界都感到很大便利。现在正是秋收季节，城乡物资交流活跃，该行为便利公私贸易运销事业，使工农业产品得到更进一步的圆滑供应和加速资金周转起见，决定继续扩大电话汇款范围，以适应顾客需要。电话汇款的优点是：（一）时间迅速，上午汇款，下午交到，下午汇款，一般的也可当日用款；（二）取费低廉，每笔电话汇款照电信局长途电话普通一次收费，例如：汇上海一笔，用电报汇收五七六○○元，电话汇仅收三八四○○元。
    该行营业部电话通汇地点现有：天津、长辛店、丰台、门头沟、石景山、通县、涿县、廊坊、昌平、（南口）汉沽、塘沽、保定、下花园、宣化、定县、古冶、滦县、胥各庄、唐山、张家口、石家庄、秦皇岛、大同、口泉、张北、辛集、衡水、济南、上海、邯郸、安阳、太原、青岛等地；其他各部处均有一部分通汇，不久更将扩大电话汇款地点。
