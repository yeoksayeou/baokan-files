Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 20th: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced in a war report on the morning of the 19th that People's Army units are conducting defensive battles on all fronts against the invading enemy forces.

	The enemy forces attacking in the Hwangju area continued their fierce attacks, attempting to break through the defense lines of the People's Army units. In this area, People's Army units are engaged in fierce defensive battles.

	On the east coast, the enemy forces continued to advance north of Wonsan. In this area, People's Army units launched fierce counterattacks and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy forces.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th: The American aggressors and the Li Seung-man gang have restored bloody, terroristic rule in Seoul, which they have occupied. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Seoul on the 18th, Li Eui-hong, the pseudo-police chief of the Li Seung-man regime, announced that since the occupation of Seoul, the police alone have arrested 8,000 "suspects," including more than 1,500 women. 4,000 of those arrested will be subject to military trials.

	The American and Li butchers are also forcing boys over the age of fourteen in Seoul to undergo military training, establishing "private interrogation organizations" everywhere, and formulating so-called "citizen ID cards" to distinguish between good and bad, arbitrarily persecuting all patriots.
