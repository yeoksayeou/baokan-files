Xinhua News Agency, 14th: Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Chahar Province have redrawn their adjacent administrative boundaries. The Chahar Provincial People's Government, considering the overlapping territories and inconvenient administrative management in the areas bordering the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and in accordance with the spirit of the Common Program regarding ethnic policies, submitted a request to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government. After approval, the entirety of Huade County, excluding the Third District; the area north of the Zhangduo Highway in Baoyuan County; and all leased silver land directly adjacent to the southern boundary of the Yantai Left Banner, have been placed under the jurisdiction of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. After the boundary demarcation, the original Third District of Huade County is administered by Shangdu County of Chahar Province. The area south of the Zhangduo Highway in the original Baoyuan County and the original Second District of Duolun County are merged to form Guyuan County, which remains under the jurisdiction of the People's Government of Chahar Province.

　　The working group formed by the boundary demarcation personnel of both sides started work on August 10th and had substantially completed the demarcation work by August 17th. The majority of the aforementioned three counties areas transferred from Chahar Province to the Chahar League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region comprise a total of eleven districts, 28,134 households, 112,940 people, and 1,531,701.43 mu (small mu) of cultivated land.

　　内蒙察省重划辖界
    【新华社十四日讯】内蒙古自治区与察哈尔省毗邻地区已重划辖界。察哈尔省人民政府鉴于该省与内蒙古自治区毗邻地区土地交错，行政管理不便，根据共同纲领关于民族政策的规定的精神，经呈请中央人民政府内务部批准后，已将该省化德县除第三区外之全部地区、宝源县张多公路以北地区及与沿太左旗南界紧相毗连的全部租银地、多伦县除第二区外的全部地区，划归内蒙古自治区人民政府管辖。划界后，原化德县第三区由察哈尔省商都县管辖，原宝源县张多公路以南地区和原多伦县第二区合并另设沽源县，仍归察哈尔省人民政府管辖。
    双方划界工作人员组成的工作组，自八月十日开始工作，至同月十七日已将划界工作大体完成。由察哈尔省划归内蒙古自治区察哈尔盟的上述三县大部地区，共计包括十一个区，二万八千一百三十四户，一十一万二千九百四十人，耕地一百五十三万一千七百零一点四三亩（小亩）。
