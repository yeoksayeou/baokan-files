　　Letter to Demyan Bedny
    Stalin
    Editor's Note: Issues 51, 52, and 55 of this journal published four letters from Stalin to Soviet writers, including Gorky, etc., which were first printed in Volumes 11 and 12 of the "Complete Works of Stalin" published by the Soviet State Political Literature Publishing House. This issue continues to publish the letter to the satirical poet Demyan Bedny (Note 1) from Volume 6 of the same book. These letters are not only documents of Marxist-Leninist literary theory, but also of great educational significance for other revolutionary work.

        Dear Comrade Demyan:
    The letter is too late. You have the right to scold me. But you should note: I am an extraordinarily lazy person when it comes to writing letters and correspondence in general.
    I will speak point by point.
    (1) It is very good that you are in "good spirits." The philosophy of "fin de siècle melancholy" is not our philosophy. Let those who are leaving and dying be sad. The American Whitman (Note 2) expresses our philosophy very accurately: "We live, our red blood boils, like the flame of inexhaustible power." That's right, Demyan.
    (2) You wrote: "Afraid of offending people, but also want to treat the illness." My advice is: rather offend a few male and female patients, but treat the illness well. Treat the illness, treat the illness, be sure to treat the illness. Not offending patients—this is a matter of minutes of benefit. Offending them slightly in order to treat the illness well—this is a matter of longer-term benefit. In fact, the reason why opportunists are different from their direct opposites is because they put the interests of a few minutes above the interests of a longer term. Needless to say, you will not imitate opportunists.
    (3) You wrote: "The tone of amnesty in your report to the county party secretaries is not without cunning." To put it more correctly, this is a policy, and generally speaking, this policy is inevitably tinged with a bit of cunning. I believe that after the opposition leaders have been thoroughly defeated, we, that is, the Party, should be more lenient towards ordinary opposition members and middle-level opposition members in order to promote their departure from the opposition leaders. The key is to leave the generals with no army to command. There are still 40,000 to 50,000 people in the opposition within the Party. Most of them want to get rid of their leaders, but what prevents them from doing so is their own ego, or the rudeness and arrogance of some who support the Central Committee, who always sting ordinary opposition members, thus preventing them from turning to our side. The "tone" of my report is aimed at these supporters of the Central Committee. When the opposition leaders lose face to the whole world, this, and only this, can destroy the opposition.
    (4) You asked: "Will the harvest cause us difficulties?" The harvest has already caused us a little difficulty. If our harvest volume (total harvest volume) last year was over 270 million poods, then this year we may harvest 200 million poods less. Of course, this is a blow to exports. It is true that the collective farms hit by crop failure are now five times fewer than in 1921, so it is not particularly difficult for us to overcome this disaster with our own strength. You can rest assured about this. But the blow is still a blow. However, there is some good in the bad. We have decided to take advantage of the farmers' strong determination to protect themselves from the accidental harm of drought in the future as much as possible; we will strive to use this determination in every way to implement (together with the farmers) decisive measures in building water conservancy projects and improving the quality of cultivation. We plan to start by establishing the minimum necessary Samar-Saratov-Tsaritsyn-Astrakhan-Stavropol wedge-shaped water conservancy project. We have prepared 15 to 20 million rubles for this undertaking. Next year we will turn to the southern provinces. This will be the beginning of our country's agricultural revolution. Locals say: Farmers will give significant support. Farmers won't cross themselves until they hear thunder. It turns out that the whip of drought is necessary to improve agriculture and to forever protect our country from accidental weather. Kolchak taught us to build infantry, Denikin taught us to build cavalry, and drought taught us to build agriculture. This is the path of history. There is nothing unnatural about this.
    You wrote: "Come on." Unfortunately, I can't come. I can't come because I don't have the time. I advise you to "visit Baku"—this is necessary. Tbilisi is not as interesting as Baku, although it is more attractive on the surface. If you haven't seen the forest-like oil towers, then you "haven't seen anything." I am sure that Baku can provide very rich material for beautiful works like "Gakka" (Note 3).
    Here in Moscow, the period of opening a series of congresses has not passed. Speeches and discussions at the Fifth Congress—of course, good things, but to be honest, this is just window dressing. The cordial talks we all have here with Western representatives (and Eastern representatives) are much more interesting. I had long talks with workers from Germany, France, and Poland. Truly good revolutionary "material"! It can be seen from all sides that in Western Europe, hatred is growing, a genuine revolutionary hatred for the capitalist system. I was very happy to hear their simple but powerful talk about wanting to "carry out the revolution in their own home in the Russian way." These are new workers. Such workers have never been present at our congresses. Of course, the time to carry out the revolution is not yet so close, but it is moving towards revolution—there is no doubt about this. What also surprises me is a characteristic of these workers: they hold a fervent and powerful, almost maternal, love for our country, and they have great and boundless confidence in the correctness, ability, and power of our Party. The doubts of not long ago have only left a negligible residue. This is also no accident. This is also a sign of increasing revolution.
    That's right, Demyan.
    Okay, that's enough. I shake your hand tightly.
          Yours, J. Stalin

    (Note 1) Demyan Bedny (1883-1945) was a Soviet poet. He graduated from the University of Petrograd, joined the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, and engaged in revolutionary activities. Most of his creations are satirical poems. Lenin once pointed out to Gorky the great mobilizing significance of Bedny's creations (see another article in this issue). —Translator's Note
    (Note 2) Walt Whitman (1819-1892) was an American poet, author of "Leaves of Grass," which praised the democratic spirit of the American bourgeoisie at that time, was not restricted by rhythm, and was the founder of American free verse. —Translator's Note
    (Note 3) This is a poem by Bedny (see "Complete Works of Bedny," Russian version, 1928, Volume 9, pages 86-93). —Note by the Editorial Department of Volume 6 of the Russian version of the "Complete Works of Stalin"

### 给季谟央·别德讷衣的信
斯大林

专栏：

　　给季谟央·别德讷衣的信
    斯大林
    编者按：本刊第五十一、五十二、五十五期登载了第一次刊印于苏联国家政治书籍出版局出版的《斯大林全集》第十一、十二卷中的斯大林给高尔基等苏维埃文学家的四封信。本期继续刊载同书第六卷中给讽刺诗人季谟央·别德讷衣（注一）的信。这些信不但是马列主义文艺理论的文献，而且对于其他革命工作，也是具有很大的教育意义的。
        亲爱的季谟央同志：
    信写得太迟了。你有权利骂我。但是你应当注意：关于写信以及一般信扎往还，我是异乎寻常的懒汉。
    我逐点地来讲。
    （一）你“情绪愉快”，这是很好的。“世纪末悲哀”的哲学并不是我们的哲学。让正在离去的和正在死亡的去悲哀吧。美国人惠特曼（注二）把我们的哲学表达得十分准确：“我们活着，我们鲜红的血液沸腾着，好像那消耗不尽的力量的火焰。”正是这样，季谟央。
    （二）你写道：“又怕得罪人，又要治病。”我的忠告是：宁肯得罪几位男女病号，却要好好地把病治一下。治病，治病，一定要治病。不得罪病号——这是几分钟的利益问题。为了好好地治病而稍为得罪他们一下——这是更长久的利益问题。其实机会主义者之所以区别于自己的正相反对的人，就是因为他们把几分钟的利益摆在更长久的利益之上。不用说，你是不会效法机会主义者的。
    （三）你写道：“你给县委书记们所作的报告的赦免的语调，并不是没有带着狡猾。”如果说得正确些，这里是一种政策，一般讲来，这种政策不免带着一点狡猾。我认为：把反对派首领们已经打得落花流水之后，我们，就是说党，在对待普通反对派分子和中等反对派分子方面，就应该温和一些，以便促进他们离开反对派首领们。使将军们没有军队指挥——这就是妙诀的所在。现在反对派在党内还有四——五万人。他们大多数都想丢开自己的首领们，但是妨碍他们这样作的是他们自己的爱面子，或者是某些拥护中央的人们的粗暴和高傲，这些拥护中央的人们总是刺伤普通反对派分子，这样就阻碍了他们转到我们方面来。我的报告的“语调”是针对着这些拥护中央的人们的。当反对派首领们向全世界丢了脸的时候，这样做，也只有这样做，才可以摧毁反对派。
    （四）你问：“收成是否会使我们发生困难。”收成已使我们发生了一点困难。如果去年我们的收获量（总收获量）是二万万七千余万普特，那末今年可能要少收二万万普特。当然，这对输出是一个打击。诚然，遭到歉收的农庄现在比起一九二一年来要少五倍，因此我们用自己的力量去克服这个灾祸是不特别费力的。这一点你可以不必怀疑。但打击仍然是打击。然而坏的当中并不是没有好的。我们已经决定利用农民尽一切可能以保障自己将来不受旱灾的偶然侵害的强烈决心；我们将竭力以一切方法利用这种决心来实行（同农民一起）建立水利工程和提高耕作质量方面的断然措施。我们打算先从建立这个最低限度必要的萨马尔——沙拉托夫——察里津——阿斯特拉汉——斯塔夫罗波尔楔形水利工程着手。为了这个事业我们准备了一千五百万到二千万卢布。下一年我们要转向南方各省。这将是我国农业革命的开端。当地人说：农民会给与重大的支持。天不打雷，农夫是不会划十字的。原来旱灾的皮鞭对于提高农业、对于永远保障我国不受天气的偶然侵害，是必要的。高尔察克教训了我们建设步兵，邓尼金教训了我们建设骑兵，旱灾则教训我们建设农业。这就是历史的道路。这里并没有什么不自然的东西。
    你写道：“来吧。”可惜我不能来。我不能来，因为没有功夫。我劝你“到巴库玩玩”——这是必要的。梯弗里斯比起巴库来不是那么有趣，虽然在外表上更吸引人。如果你还没有看见过森林般的石油塔，那末你就“什么也没有看到过”。我确信巴库能提供像“加卡”（注三）这类美丽作品的极丰富的材料。
    在我们这里，在莫斯科，开一连串代表大会的时期还没有过去。第五次代表大会上的演说和讨论——当然是好事情，但老实说来，这不过是装饰门面而已。我们大家在这里与西方代表（以及东方代表）所进行的亲切的谈话，要有意思得多。我与德国、法国、波兰的工人们作了长时间的谈话。真是很好的革命的“材料”！从各方面都可以看出：在西欧那里，增长着仇恨，对资本主义制度的真正革命的仇恨。我很高兴听到他们愿意在自己家里“按照俄国方式实行革命”的简单的然而有力量的谈话。这是新的工人。这样的工人在我们的代表大会上还不曾有过。当然，实行革命的时候还不是这样地接近，但正在走向革命——这一点是可以不必怀疑的。还使我惊讶的是这些工人的一个特点：对于我国怀抱着热烈的和强有力的几乎是母性的爱，对于我们党的正确性、能力、威力抱有着巨大无限的信心。不久以前的怀疑只剩下区区毫不足道的残余了。这也不是偶然的。这也是日益增长的革命的征兆。
    正是这样，季谟央。
    好，已经够了。紧握你的手。
          你的约·斯大林
          一九二四年七月十五日
    （一）季谟央·别德讷衣（１８８３——１９４５）是苏联诗人。曾卒业于彼得格勒大学，参加俄国社会民主工党，从事革命活动。其创作大多是讽刺诗。列宁曾向高尔基指出别德讷衣创作的巨大鼓动意义（参看本期另文）。——译者注
    （二）惠特曼（１８１９——１８９２）是美国诗人，著有《草叶集》，歌颂当时美国资产阶级的民主精神，不受韵律拘束，为美国自由诗的创始者。——译者注
    （三）这是别德讷衣的一篇诗（见《别德讷衣全集》，俄文本，一九二八年，第九卷，第八六——九三页）。——《斯大林全集》俄文本第六卷编辑部注
