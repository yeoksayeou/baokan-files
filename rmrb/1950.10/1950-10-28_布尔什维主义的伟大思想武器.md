　　The Great Ideological Weapon of Bolshevism
    Midin
    Twelve years have passed since the first printing of the "Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)." This work occupies a special place in the creation of outstanding Marxist-Leninist thought. Its influence is indeed great.

    The "Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," written by Stalin—the unparalleled master of revolutionary theory and revolutionary practice—summarizes the rich experience of the great Bolshevik Party; systematically explaining the glorious path traversed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union—from the Marxist groups that emerged in Russia in the 1880s to the great Communist Party that became the leading force of the world's first socialist country.

    The "Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" is the scientific history of Bolshevism. It shows how the Bolshevik Party put the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism into practice, and how its leaders creatively developed and enriched the theory of Marxism-Leninism in accordance with specific historical conditions.

    The "Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" shows how the party's leaders overcame enormous difficulties in the most complex situations, fought against the entire array of the proletariat's enemies, and laid the foundations for the ideology, organization, tactics, and theory of this new type of party. The "Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" scientifically explains how such a powerful force as the Bolshevik Party was formed and developed, how it led the Russian masses in their attack on capitalism, created the world's first state of working people, and inspired the Soviet peoples of all nationalities to march to the victory of socialism. The entire early history of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) explains why the Communist Party was able to unite and organize the masses, repel the treacherous attack on the Soviet Union by the Hitlerites, bring about the complete defeat of German fascism and Japanese militarism, save European civilization from destruction, and liberate the peoples of many European countries from fascist bondage. The entire heroic path traversed by the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), so profoundly summarized and so vividly depicted in Stalin's work, makes one confident that the Bolshevik Party will victoriously lead the Soviet people towards the construction of a communist society.

    The "Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" shows how the Bolshevik Party grew stronger in the course of fierce struggles against the enemies of the people, and how it smashed the landlords, capitalists, kulaks, saboteurs, and spies. This book shows how powerfully the Bolshevik Party purged all the lackeys of the capitalist world who attempted to hinder the victorious advance of the proletarian revolution and the construction of socialism.

    The "Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" is the best source of revolutionary experience and revolutionary inspiration for cadres of communist parties in all countries. Studying the history of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) is to arm ourselves with the knowledge of the laws of political struggle, the knowledge of revolutionary dynamics, and the knowledge of the laws of social development. We read in this book: "The study of the history of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) strengthens the confidence in the ultimate victory of the great cause of the Lenin-Stalin party, the confidence in the victory of communism throughout the world."

    I

    The communist parties of capitalist countries have drawn valuable experience from the history of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to carry out the struggle against capitalism, against the warmongers of imperialism, and to fight for bread, peace, and freedom for the working people. They are learning from the great example of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) how to unite the broad masses of the people around the banner of the party, how to wage a victorious struggle against bourgeois political parties, and how to consistently expose the right-wing socialist agents in the working class. The communist parties in these countries learn from the experience of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) how to combat sectarian viewpoints that hinder the party from connecting with the proletarian and non-proletarian working masses. They learn how to find the way to reach the broad proletarian masses, to reach the hearts of the working people, and how to prepare their conditions for the struggle to overthrow capitalist slavery.

    The communist and workers' parties in the people's democratic countries have drawn valuable guidance from the experience of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to carry out the victorious national liberation struggle against fascist slavery, and to establish the power of the working people headed by the working class. They are learning from the experience of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) how to victoriously build socialism, and how to struggle against class enemies under the specific conditions of a form of proletarian dictatorship, the people's democratic system. The "Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" makes the communist and workers' parties in the people's democratic countries aware of the difficulties encountered in building a socialist society and how to overcome them. The experience of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) teaches that the struggle for socialist industrialization, the accumulation of capital to establish heavy industry, to enable it to technically re-equip the entire national economy, to train new technicians and engineers, and the struggle against sabotage all require mobilizing the full strength of the party and the people. The most difficult historical task of the proletarian dictatorship is: to transform the small individual peasant households onto the socialist road, to strictly adhere to the principle of voluntariness in transforming the peasants onto the road of collective farms, and to eliminate the kulaks as a class when all the necessary conditions are ripe, and to eradicate the last remnants of capitalism. The completion of these tasks requires skillful political leadership and a high degree of awareness of the cadres of the communist and workers' parties.

    Stalin's book exposes those counter-revolutionary "theories"—"theories" hostile to Marxism-Leninism—that advocate the gradual dying out of class struggle and the "peaceful growth" of capitalism into communism. Based on the experience of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Comrade Stalin analyzes many facts in the life of the Soviet state and the Bolshevik Party, and proves that the struggle for socialism is a fierce class struggle, and the victory of socialism arouses the active resistance of the enemies of socialism at home and abroad. From the experience of the Soviet Union, from the experience of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), it is clear that in the struggle against the peoples of all countries and against those countries that have embarked on the road of building socialism, the imperialist world is now using and will continue to use all sorts of cunning ways of struggle to undermine the establishment of a new life.

    The "Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" teaches the communist and workers' parties and all working people revolutionary vigilance. The imperialist bourgeoisie, in its struggle against the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, utilizes the hired and corrupt leaders of the social democratic parties—these loyal lackeys of the bourgeoisie, whose lifelong purpose is only to support the tottering and decaying capitalist system. The likes of Attlee and Bevin, Mock and Schumacher, Saragat and Renner will be "recorded in history" because they are one of the last lines of defense built by capitalism to maintain its rule and keep the working masses submissive. These so-called social democrats are nothing more than American parties distributed in various countries. It is now impossible to find anyone who promotes American reactionary policies more loyally than the leaders of the right-wing social democratic parties.

    The imperialist bourgeoisie is also using the despicable spy gang of Tito-Rankovic in the struggle against the powerful progressive forces. With the help of Anglo-American imperialists, they have seized power in Yugoslavia, persecute the Yugoslav people, and carry out the shameful tasks assigned by the imperialist intelligence agencies and the military staffs of aggressive bourgeois states. The great experience of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) teaches us how to steadfastly, consistently, and relentlessly expose these and other enemies of the working class; how to expose them and make them known to the world, and how to continuously raise the vigilance of the masses; and how to fight against the enemies of the people.

    II

    The conclusion of the "Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" is of particular importance. In concise language and rich content, Comrade Stalin summarizes the main lessons learned by the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in the historical journey it has traveled. These conclusions of the history of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) are particularly important for all communist and workers' parties in the world—for those who are struggling under the difficult conditions of the capitalist system, for those who are working in illegal or semi-legal conditions, and for those who are already in power.

    The main lesson of the history of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) is that without a true proletarian revolutionary party, the working people have no, and cannot have any victory, and they will not, and cannot be liberated from the bondage of capitalism.

    "The history of the party teaches us first of all that the victory of the proletarian revolution, the victory of the proletarian dictatorship, is impossible without a revolutionary proletarian party, without a party that is not contaminated by opportunism, that takes an uncompromising attitude towards compromisers and surrenderers, and that takes a revolutionary attitude towards the bourgeoisie and its state power."

    Only a Marxist-Leninist party can be such a party: a party capable of leading the broad masses of working people to attack capitalism, leading them to build socialism, and carrying out social revolution. Lenin and Stalin created and tempered such a party.

    Throughout the book, Stalin explains how highly the Bolshevik Party valued the role and importance of revolutionary theory.

    We can read the following words in the conclusion of the "Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)": "The strength of Marxist-Leninist theory lies in its ability to enable the party to judge the situation, to understand the internal connections of surrounding events, to anticipate the course of events, and not only to know how events are developing at present and where they are developing, but also to know how events will develop in the future and where they will develop."

    Only Marxist-Leninist theory gives the party confidence that it can correctly complete the tasks it faces. A party that has not mastered Marxist-Leninist theory is bound to grope blindly; it has no confidence in its actions; it has no ability to lead the working class forward.

    In the conclusion of the "Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," Comrade Stalin fiercely condemns dogmatism. He writes: "Marxist-Leninist theory must never be regarded as a collection of dogmas, as a collection of catechism answers, as a kind of creed, and Marxists themselves must be regarded as pedants and memorizers."

    In his recent works discussing linguistics, Stalin sharply criticizes dogmatism and scholasticism, and points out that Marxism is irreconcilable with dogmatism. Comrade Stalin explains that mastering Marxist-Leninist theory means constantly enriching this theory with the new experience of the revolutionary movement, and being able to replace some of its outdated principles that are not suitable for the new environment with new principles and new conclusions arising from the new historical environment.

    Comrade Stalin cites Lenin's great discovery that the Soviet Republic is the best political form of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and other great discoveries such as Lenin's belief that socialism can be victorious in a single country, as an example of how Lenin advanced Marxist theory in the new historical era—the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution.

    The "Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" says, "It is precisely because Lenin and the Leninists advanced Marxist theory that Leninism is a further development of Marxism, Marxism under the new conditions of the proletarian class struggle, Marxism in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution, and Marxism in the era when socialism has won victory on one-sixth of the earth."

    Throughout the book, Stalin attaches great importance to the working class party's carrying out criticism and self-criticism. He writes that if the Bolshevik Party hopes to play the role of leader of the working class, it must not be dizzy with success, not be arrogant, and be able to see its own shortcomings. As historical experience teaches, one of the main reasons for the demise of revolutionary parties is that they conceal their difficult problems with pretense and all is well, and their conceit isolates them from life and makes them ugly.

    The "Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" says: "If the party is not afraid of criticism and self-criticism, if the party does not cover up the mistakes and shortcomings in its work, if the party can educate and train cadres based on the erroneous examples in the party's work, and if the party is good at correcting its mistakes in time, then it will be invincible."

    III

    Comrade Stalin emphasizes that dialectical materialism and historical materialism constitute the theoretical basis of communism. Dialectical materialism and historical materialism are the world outlook of the Marxist-Leninist party, and the theoretical basis of the party. Therefore, studying this foundation is the responsibility of every active member of the communist and workers' parties.

    Stalin's work on dialectical materialism and historical materialism—an organic part of the "Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)"—has its own importance. It raises Marxist-Leninist philosophy to a new level. The most important feature of this work is that it points out the deep relationship between Marxist philosophy and the revolutionary activities of the Bolshevik Party. This work most forcefully points out the conclusions that must be drawn from Marxist dialectics for the party's practical revolutionary activities. It points out that the Bolshevik Party, which takes Marxist dialectics as its guide to action, always looks forward, not backward, towards everything progressive, towards everything promising, and towards everything growing and developing.

    The need for the working class party to implement revolutionary policies arises directly from Marxist dialectics. Comrade Stalin points out that in order not to make mistakes in policy, one must be a revolutionary, not a reformist, and implement an uncompromising proletarian class policy, not a policy of reconciling the interests of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

    The need to not cover up the various contradictions in the capitalist system, but to "expose these contradictions, not to try to stop the class struggle, but to carry the class struggle through to the end," arises directly from Marxist dialectics.

    In this way, Stalin links theoretical issues with the practice of the revolutionary struggle of the proletarian party, and in this way, he points out Marxism-Leninism in action. The reason why the Bolshevik Party was able to successfully solve the tasks it faced was due to the fact that throughout its history, the party steadfastly and consistently took advanced revolutionary theory as its guide. Taking this advanced theory as a guide, and understanding the course of social events and the laws of political struggle, the Bolshevik Party has continuously advanced victoriously in its history.

    Comrade Stalin also explains how the course of historical events has thrown the "economists," Mensheviks, social revolutionaries, and others who did not know the laws of social development into the dustbin of history, where they were crushed and destroyed.

    The "Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" is a great ideological weapon of the communist and workers' parties of the world. Millions of working people in various countries are studying this brilliant work, and gaining from it the confidence in their struggle, the confidence in victory.

    Following in the footsteps of the Hitlerite bandits, the imperialist warmongers have launched a fascist crusade against the communist parties in several countries. They are blindly and truly believing that they can "destroy" Marxism and "destroy" communism. Comrade Stalin once exposed the same attempt by the Hitlerite bandits. He wrote: "Marxism is the scientific expression of the fundamental interests of the working class. If Marxism is to be destroyed, the working class must be destroyed. It is impossible to destroy the working class. More than eighty years have passed since the birth of Marxism. During this period, dozens and hundreds of bourgeois governments have tried to destroy Marxism. But what is the result? Bourgeois governments have come and gone, but Marxism is still advancing. Moreover, Marxism has won complete victory on one-sixth of the earth—and it is precisely in the countries where Marxism was thought to have been completely destroyed that it has won this victory."

    Since Stalin wrote these extraordinary sentences, Marxism has won new and brilliant victories. Marxism cannot be "destroyed."

    The capitalist system is an outdated system. It can only "guarantee" the people an arms race, new wars, the destruction of productive forces, bestial crimes, and the destruction of millions of people. What the Hitlerite bandits did in the Second World War, and what the American imperialist robbers are now doing in Korea, shows what capitalism is "capable" of doing under the current historical conditions. But there are powerful forces opposing the world of oppression, bloodshed, and violence. These forces are developing, becoming more consolidated, and becoming stronger day by day. The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the people's democratic countries, and the peace movement in various countries—prove that the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism are powerful and invincible.

    Armed with the great ideological weapon of scientific communism, the communist and workers' parties of various countries are marching towards and will achieve the final victory.

　　布尔什维主义的伟大思想武器
    米丁
    自联共（布）党史简明教程首次印行以来，已经过了十二年。这一著作在杰出的马列主义思想的创作中占有一个特殊的位置。它的影响的确是很大的。
    斯大林——无与伦比的革命理论和革命实践的大师——所写的联共（布）党史简明教程总结了伟大的布尔什维克党的丰富经验；有层次地说明了苏联共产党走过的光荣的道路——从十九世纪八十年代在俄国产生的马克思主义小组，到成为世界上第一个社会主义国家的领导力量的伟大的共产党。
    联共（布）党史简明教程是布尔什维主义的科学的历史。它显示了布尔什维克党如何把马列主义的学说付诸实践，它的领袖们如何按照具体的历史条件，创造性地发展并丰富了马列主义的理论。
    联共（布）党史简明教程显示，党的领导者如何在最复杂的情况中克服巨大困难，对无产阶级敌人的整个阵容进行斗争，规定了这个新型的党的思想、组织、策略、理论的基础。联共（布）党史科学地说明了，像布尔什维克党这样一个强大的力量是怎样形成和怎样发展的，它领导俄国群众进攻资本主义，创造了世界上第一个劳动人民的国家，鼓舞苏联各族人民走到社会主义的胜利。联共（布）党整个早期的历史说明，为什么共产党能够团结和组织群众，击退希特勒分子对苏联的背信弃义的进攻，促成德国法西斯主义和日本军国主义的完全失败，拯救欧洲文明免于毁灭，由法西斯的束缚下解放欧洲许多国家人民。在斯大林的著作中得到如此深刻的总结和如此生动的描绘的，联共（布）党走过的全部英雄的道路，使人深信布尔什维克党将胜利地领导苏联人民走向建设共产主义社会。
    联共（布）党史简明教程显示，布尔什维克党如何在与人民的敌人作激烈斗争中壮大起来，如何打垮地主、资本家、富农、破坏者和间谍。这本书显示了布尔什维克党如何有力地肃清资本主义世界的一切走狗，企图阻挠无产阶级革命的胜利进军和社会主义的建设的走狗们。
    联共（布）党史简明教程是一切国家共产党干部的革命经验和革命启示的最好源泉。研究布尔什维克党的历史就是用政治斗争规律的知识，革命动力的知识，和社会发展规律的知识把我们武装起来。我们在这本书中读到：“研究联共（布）党史就能巩固列宁——斯大林党伟大事业最终胜利的信心，共产主义在全世界胜利的信心。”
    一
    资本主义国家的共产党从联共（布）党史中吸取了宝贵的经验，来进行反对资本主义、反对帝国主义战争贩子的斗争，为劳动人民争取面包、和平和自由的斗争。它们正从联共（布）党的伟大榜样中学习如何把广大人民群众团结在党的旗帜周围，如何对资产阶级政党进行胜利的斗争，如何坚持不渝地揭露工人阶级中的右翼社会党的代理机关。这些国家中的共产党由联共（布）党的经验中学习如何与阻碍党联系无产阶级和非无产阶级劳动群众的宗派主义观点作斗争。它们学习如何找出走到广大的无产阶级群众中，走到劳动人民心中的道路，如何准备自己的条件来进行推翻资本主义奴役制度的斗争。
    人民民主国家里的共产党和工人党曾经由联共（布）党的经验中吸取了宝贵的指导，来进行胜利的反对法西斯奴役的民族解放斗争、和建立以工人阶级为首的劳动人民的政权。它们正由联共（布）党的经验中学习如何胜利地建设社会主义、如何在无产阶级专政的一种形式，人民民主制度的具体条件下与阶级敌人斗争。联共（布）党史简明教程使人民民主国家中的共产党和工人党了解到在建设社会主义社会中要遇到的困难，以及如何克服它们。联共（布）党的经验教导说，社会主义工业化的斗争，积累资金以建立重工业，使其能够在技术上重新装备整个国民经济，训练新的技师和工程师干部，以及反破坏的斗争都要求动员党和人民的全部力量。无产阶级专政的最困难的历史性任务是：使小的个体农户转上社会主义道路，在使农民转上集体农庄的发展道路时严守自愿原则，在一切必要条件成熟时把富农作为一个阶级加以消灭、根除资本主义的最后根苗。这些任务的完成要求巧妙的政治领导和共产党及工人党干部的高度的觉悟。
    斯大林这本书揭露了那些主张阶级斗争逐渐消亡、和资本主义“和平生长”到共产主义的种种反革命的“理论”——与马列主义敌对的“理论”。斯大林同志根据联共（布）党的经验，分析苏维埃国家以及布尔什维克党的生活中的许多事实，结果证明：争取社会主义的斗争是一个剧烈的阶级斗争，社会主义的胜利引起国内外社会主义的敌人的积极抵抗。从苏联的经验，从联共（布）党的经验看来，很明显地，在反对各国人民和反对那些已走上建设社会主义之路的国家的斗争中，帝国主义世界现在运用着而且还将继续运用各式各样奸巧的斗争方式，以便破坏新生活的建立。
    联共（布）党史简明教程教给共产党与工人党以及所有劳动人民以革命警惕性。帝国主义资产阶级在反对和平民、主和社会主义阵营的斗争中利用雇佣的、腐朽的社会民主党首领们——这些资产阶级忠实的走狗，他们毕生的目的就只是支持那个摇摇欲坠的、腐烂的资本主义体系。艾德礼和贝文之流、莫克和舒马赫之流、萨拉盖特和伦纳之流将要“名列史册”，因为他们是资本主义为保持其统治和使劳动群众继续顺服而建立起来的最后防线之一。这些所谓社会民主党不过是分布于各国中的美国党。现在要想找到比右翼社会民主党的首领们更忠实地替美国反动政策宣传的人，简直是不可能的。
    帝国主义资产阶级在反对强大的进步势力的斗争中也正利用铁托——兰科维奇那种卑鄙的间谍伙帮，他们在英美帝国主义者帮助之下，已在南斯拉夫夺取了政权，迫害南斯拉夫人民并执行帝国主义情报机关和侵略的资产阶级国家军事参谋部所指派的可耻的任务。联共（布）党的伟大经验教导我们应怎样坚定地、始终如一地、无情地揭露这些及工人阶级的其他敌人；怎样予以揭穿并将其公诸于世，而且继续不断地提高群众的警惕性；怎样和人民的敌人作战。
    二
    联共（布）党史简明教程的结束语有特殊的重要性。斯大林同志以简洁的文字、丰富的内容，综述了联共（布）党在所经过的历史行程中获得的主要教训。联共（布）党史的这些结束语对于世界上所有的共产党和工人党特别重要——对于那些在资本主义制度的困难情况下奋斗的人们，对于那些在非法的或半合法情况下工作的人们，对于那些已经执政的人们。都是特别重要的。
    联共（布）党史的主要教训是：没有一个真正的无产阶级的革命政党，劳动人民就没有，也不可能有任何胜利，他们不会，也不可能从资本主义的束缚下解放出来。
    “党史首先教导我们说：无产阶级革命的胜利，无产阶级专政的胜利，没有革命无产阶级政党，没有这样一个不受机会主义沾染，对妥协者和投降主义者取毫不调和的态度，对资产阶级及其国家政权持革命态度的政党是不可能的。”
    只有一个马列主义政党才能是这样的一个政党：一个有能力领导广大劳动人民群众向资本主义进攻，领导他们建设社会主义的、进行社会革命的政党。列宁和斯大林缔造了并且锻炼了这样的一个政党。
    斯大林在全书中都说明：布尔什维克党将革命理论的作用和重要性提到怎样的高度。
    我们从联共（布）党史简明教程结束语中可以读到如下的话：“马列主义理论强有力的地方，就在于它能使党判明局势，能了解周围事变的内在联系，能预察事变的进程，不仅能察知事变在目前怎样发展和向何处发展，而且能察知事变在将来会怎样发展和向何处发展。”
    只有马列主义理论使党具有信心，相信能够正确地完成所面临的任务。一个没有精通马列主义理论的党是不得不盲目的摸索；它对它的行动没有信心；它没有能力领导工人阶级前进。
    斯大林同志在联共（布）党史简明教程结束语中痛斥教条主义。他写道：“决不可把马列主义理论看成是一部教条集录，看成是一部教理答案，看成是一种信仰条规，把马克思主义者本身看成是一些咬文嚼字和死读呆记的人。”
    斯大林在他最近讨论语言学的著作中尖锐地抨击教条主义和犹太传经主义，并指出：马克思主义是和教条主义势不两立的。斯大林同志解释道：精通马列主义理论，那就是说要经常拿革命运动的新经验来丰富这个理论，能够用从新历史环境中产生的新原理和新结论代替其某些已经过时的、不适合于新环境的原理。
    斯大林同志以列宁所认为的苏维埃共和国是无产阶级专政最好的政治形式这一伟大的发现，和列宁认为社会主义可能在单独一国获得胜利等其他伟大的发现为例，说明列宁在新的历史时代——帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代——中向前推进了马克思主义理论的一个范例。
    联共（布）党史简明教程说，“正因为列宁和列宁主义者向前推进了马克思主义理论，所以列宁主义是马克思主义更进一步的发展，是无产阶级阶级斗争新条件下的马克思主义，是帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义，是社会主义在全世界六分之一的地面上获得了胜利时代的马克思主义。”
    在全书中，斯大林非常重视工人阶级政党开展批评和自我批评。他写道，布尔什维克党如果希望起工人阶级领袖的作用，就必须不被胜利冲昏头脑，不自高自大，能够看到自己的缺点。如历史经验所教导的革命政党灭亡的主要原因之一，是因为它们用假装，百事大吉来掩饰它们的困难问题，一味自高自大，自满把它们自己和生活割开并且丢了丑。
    联共（布）党史简明教程说：“如果党不害怕批评和自我批评，如果党不去掩盖自己工作中的错误和缺点，如果党能根据党工作中错误的实例来教育和训练干部，如果党善于及时改正自己的错误，那它就会是不可战胜的。”
    三
    斯大林同志着重指出，辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义构成了共产主义的理论基础。辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义是马列主义党的世界观，是党的理论基础。因此，研究这个基础便是共产党和工人党的每一积极党员的责任。
    斯大林关于辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的著作，——联共（布）党史简明教程的一个有机部分，——是有它自己的重要性的。它把马列主义哲学提高到新的水平。这篇著作最重要的特点，是它指出了马克思主义哲学和布尔什维克党的革命活动间的深切关系。这篇著作最有力地指出了从马克思主义辩证法中为党的实际革命活动所必须得出的结论，它指出，以马克思主义辩证法为其行动指针的布尔什维克党，总是向前看，而不是向后看，它朝向一切进步的东西，朝向一切有前途的东西，朝向一切生长和发展着的东西。
    从马克思主义辩证法直接产生了工人阶级政党执行革命政策的需要。斯大林同志指出，为了不犯政策的错误，便要做革命家，而不要做改良主义者，要执行不妥协的无产阶级的阶级政策，而不要执行调和无产阶级与资产阶级利益的政策。
    从马克思主义辩证法直接产生这一需要，即不要掩饰资本主义制度中的各种矛盾，而是要“揭露这些矛盾，不是要设法阻止阶级斗争，而是要把阶级斗争进行到底。”
    这样，斯大林把理论问题和无产阶级政党革命斗争的实践联系起来，这样，他指出了行动中的马列主义。布尔什维克党之所以能够顺利解决它所面临的任务，便是由于这一事实——党在整个历史中，是坚定不移、一贯地以先进的革命理论为指针的。以这个先进理论为指针，而且了解到社会事件的进程、政治斗争的规律，布尔什维克党便在其历史中不断胜利地前进着。
    斯大林同志也说明历史事件的进程如何把“经济主义者”，孟什维克，社会革命党人及其他不知道社会发展的规律因而便被粉碎及毁灭了的人们，抛弃到历史的垃圾箱中。
    联共（布）党史简明教程是世界共产党和工人党的一个伟大的思想武器。各国的千百万劳动人民正研究这本光辉的著作，从它获得他们斗争的信心，胜利的信心。
    帝国主义战争贩子步希特勒匪帮的后尘，向若干国家中的共产党发动了法西斯十字军。他们竟盲目地真正相信他们能够“毁灭”马克思主义，“毁灭”共产主义。斯大林同志曾揭露了希特勒匪帮的同样企图。他写道：“马克思主义是工人阶级基本利益的科学表现。如果要毁灭马克思主义，就必须毁灭工人阶级。毁灭工人阶级是不可能的。自从马克思主义出世以来，已有八十多年了。在这个时期中，曾有几十几百个资产阶级政府试图毁灭马克思主义。但结果怎样呢？资产阶级政府来了又去了，但马克思主义则仍在前进中。而且，马克思主义已在地球的六分之一的地面上获得完全的胜利——而且正是在马克思主义被认为已完全毁灭了的国家内获得了这个胜利。”
    自从斯大林写下这些非凡的句子以来，马克思主义已获得新的光辉的胜利。马克思主义是“毁灭”不了的。
    资本主义制度是过时的制度。它只能向人民“保证”军备竞赛，新战争，生产力的破坏，兽性的罪行，毁灭千百万人民。希特勒匪徒在二次世界大战中所做的，美帝国主义强盗现在在朝鲜所做的，显示了资本主义在目前历史条件下倒底“能够”做些什么。但却有强大的力量对抗着压迫、血腥和暴力的世界。这些力量天天在发展着，越来越巩固，越来越强大。苏联、中华人民共和国、各人民民主国家，各国的和平运动——证明了和平、民主和社会主义的力量是强大的和不可战胜的。
    以科学共产主义的伟大思想武器武装着的各国共产党和工人党，正走向并将获得最后胜利。
