Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The members of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace in Beijing, together with the representatives of various people's organizations and democratic parties participating in the Chinese People's Committee to Resist American Aggression and Aid Korea, held a joint meeting in Beijing today. The meeting passed an important resolution to merge and reorganize the "China Committee for the Defense of World Peace" and the "Chinese People's Committee to Resist American Aggression and Aid Korea" into the "Chinese People's Committee to Defend World Peace and Resist American Aggression."

The joint meeting was attended by 108 people, including Guo Moruo, Peng Zhen, Chen Shutong, Huang Yanpei, Ma Xulun, Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, Zhang Bojun, Peng Zemin, Xu Deheng, Cai Tingkai, Zhu Xuefan, Deng Yingchao, Liao Chengzhi, Situ Meitang, Luo Longji, Shi Liang, Chen Qiyuan, Shen Yanbing, Hu Qiaomu, Hua Luogeng, Zhao Zichen, Ding Zan, Li Zongen, Li Xiuzhen, Wu Youxun, Xing Xiping, Zhou Jianren, Zhu Kezhen, Xu Beihong, Xu Guangping, Lu Zhiwei, Zhang Xiruo, Tao Menghe, Zeng Zhaolun, Tang Yongtong, Ye Qisun, Xiao San, and Qian Duansheng.

Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace and the Chinese People's Committee to Resist American Aggression and Aid Korea, chaired the joint meeting. Guo Moruo delivered a work report on the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace and the Committee to Resist American Aggression and Aid Korea. He said that the main task of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace over the past year was to launch a peace signature campaign throughout the country. He announced that, as of now, 240,448,972 people across the country have signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal. Guo Moruo pointed out that this is a manifestation of the great will of the people of the whole country, which shows that the Chinese people unanimously and resolutely oppose American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Korea, and also fully demonstrates that the movement to defend world peace is closely linked with the movement to oppose American imperialism's aggression. Therefore, Guo Moruo suggested that the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace and the Chinese People's Committee to Resist American Aggression and Aid Korea be merged and reorganized into the Chinese People's Committee to Defend World Peace and Resist American Aggression, in order to strengthen and expand the movement to oppose aggression and defend peace in the face of the increasingly serious situation of American aggression. Guo Moruo said that American imperialism has occupied our country's Taiwan, and now it has even set the flames of the war of aggression against Korea to the doorstep of our motherland. We, the Chinese people, must mobilize to oppose American aggression against Korea and defend our territory. This is the most effective way for us to defend world peace. Subsequently, Peng Zhen, representative of the Chinese Communist Party, Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Huang Yanpei, representative of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Ma Xulun, representative of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Shao Lizi, representative of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and Zhang Bojun, representative of the China Democratic League, spoke at the meeting one after another. They unanimously agreed with Chairman Guo Moruo's proposal and expressed their determination to resolutely oppose the aggression of American imperialism and strive to strengthen the movement to defend peace.

Peng Zhen said: The American aggressors occupy our territory of Taiwan and invade Korea, like two knives inserted into China. The people of the whole country must further mobilize and organize to oppose the aggression of American imperialism. The work of defending peace and opposing American aggression must be greatly strengthened and treated as an urgent task. The Chinese people love peace the most, but they are not afraid of resisting aggression, and they have full strength and confidence to win victory in the struggle against American aggression.

Chen Shutong said: To defend peace, the Chinese people must further unite under the leadership of the Central People's Government and resolutely oppose our enemy, the American imperialists.

Huang Yanpei said: The American imperialists now want to annex the entire Korea. Korea is our neighbor, and if the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold. The Chinese people must not sit idly by, and we must support the Korean people.

Ma Xulun said: The Korean people are bravely resisting the common enemy of the Chinese and Korean people, the American imperialists. Aiding the Korean people is aiding ourselves.

Shao Lizi said: To defend world peace, we must oppose the aggression of American imperialism. American imperialism is the enemy of world peace and also the enemy of the Chinese people.

Zhang Bojun said: The merger of the two groups this time is a concrete combination of internationalism and patriotism. The Chinese people must unite with the world's peace and democratic forces led by the Soviet Union, resolutely oppose American aggression, and defend world peace.

The joint meeting unanimously adopted the resolution to merge and reorganize the two groups into the "Chinese People's Committee to Defend World Peace and Resist American Aggression," and adopted the list of the National Committee and responsible persons of the Chinese People's Committee to Defend World Peace and Resist American Aggression. The meeting also approved the list of the Chinese delegation to the Second World Peace Congress.

    我国和大委员会与反对美国侵略委员会合并

    【新华社二十六日讯】中国保卫世界和平大会委员会在京委员与参加中国人民反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动委员会的各人民团体代表及各民主党派代表，今日在北京举行联席会议。会议通过将“中国保卫世界和平大会委员会”及“中国人民反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜委员会”合并改组为“中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会”的重要决议。
    参加联席会议的计有郭沫若、彭真、陈叔通、黄炎培、马叙伦、张治中、邵力子、章伯钧、彭泽民、许德珩、蔡廷锴、朱学范、邓颖超、廖承志、司徒美堂、罗隆基、史良、陈其瑗、沈雁冰、胡乔木、华罗庚、赵紫宸、丁瓒、李宗恩、李秀贞、吴有训、邢西萍、周建人、竺可桢、徐悲鸿、许广平、陆志韦、张奚若、陶孟和、曾昭抡、汤用彤、叶企荪、萧三、钱端升等一百零八人。
    中国保卫世界和平大会委员会、中国人民反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动委员会主席郭沫若担任联席会议的主席。郭沫若在会上作了关于中国和大委员会及反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动委员会的工作报告。他说：中国保卫世界和平大会委员会一年来的主要工作，是在全国范围之内展开了和平签名运动。他宣布：截至目前为止，全国已有二亿零四百四十八万九千一百七十二人在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签了名。郭沫若指出：这是全国人民伟大意志的表现，这表示中国人民一致坚决反对美国帝国主义侵略台湾朝鲜，也充分地说明了保卫世界和平运动与反对美帝国主义侵略的运动是密切结合着的。因此，郭沫若建议中国保卫世界和平大会委员会与中国人民反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜委员会合并改组为中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会，以便在美国侵略行为日益严重的形势下，加强和扩大反对侵略、保卫和平运动。郭沫若说：美帝国主义侵占了我国的台湾，现在更把侵略朝鲜战争的火焰烧到我们祖国的门口。我们中国人民要动员起来，反对美国对朝鲜的侵略，保卫我们的国土。这就是我们保卫世界和平的最有效的方法。接着，在会上相继发言的有中国共产党代表彭真、中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席陈叔通、民主建国会代表黄炎培、民主促进会代表马叙伦、中国国民党革命委员会代表邵力子、中国民主同盟代表章伯钧。他们一致赞成郭沫若主席的建议，并表示将坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略，努力加强保卫和平运动。
    彭真说：美国侵略者侵占我国领土台湾和侵略朝鲜，像两把刀一样插向我们中国。全国人民要进一步地动员起来与组织起来，反对美帝国主义的侵略。保卫和平与反对美国侵略的工作要大大加强，要当作紧急的工作来做。中国人民是最爱好和平的，但并不害怕反抗侵略，而且有充分的力量与信心，在反对美国侵略的斗争中取得胜利。
    陈叔通说：中国人民要保卫和平，就必须在中央人民政府的领导下，进一步团结起来，坚决反对我国的敌人美帝国主义者。
    黄炎培说：美帝国主义者现在要吞并整个朝鲜。朝鲜是我国的邻邦，唇亡齿寒，我国人民绝不能坐视，我们一定要支援朝鲜人民。
    马叙伦说：朝鲜人民正英勇地抗击着中朝两国人民的共同的敌人美帝国主义者。援助朝鲜人民就是援助我们自己。
    邵力子说：要保卫世界和平，必须反对美帝国主义的侵略。美帝国主义是世界和平的敌人，也是我国人民的敌人。
    章伯钧说：这次两个团体的合并，是国际主义和爱国主义的具体结合。中国人民要和以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量团结在一起，坚决地反对美国侵略，保卫世界和平。
    联席会议一致通过了将两团体合并改组为“中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会”的决议，通过了中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会全国委员会名单及负责人名单。会议还通过了出席第二届世界保卫和平大会的中国代表团名单。
