Reasons for and Significance of Grain and Cotton Bumper Harvest
	Shí Chǔ

I

This year's agriculture in the country, with the exception of a very few areas that suffered reduced harvests due to not fully overcoming disasters of varying degrees, generally experienced bumper harvests. This is a great victory on the agricultural production front of New China.

First of all, the wheat harvest throughout the country was generally a bumper one. The total wheat output has greatly increased compared to last year. While part of this increase is due to the expansion of sown areas, the main reason is the general improvement in yield per unit area. In some areas, the bumper harvest is unprecedented in the last twenty years. For example, the average yield per mu in various parts of Fujian is 130 to 150 jin, and some even reach as high as 250 jin.

The autumn harvest situation is even more exciting. The autumn grain harvest in various parts of the country is generally at 80% or more, an increase of 10% to 30% compared to last year. The entire Northeast region is at 90%, with Songjiang and Jilin having the best harvests, reaching 100%, exceeding the usual bumper harvest years. The total output of the Northeast region this year is estimated to reach 17.82 million tons, exceeding the original planned output by 6% and increasing by more than 20% compared to last year. This year's total rice output in the Northeast has exceeded the highest output during the Japanese puppet Manchurian period by 29%, and the total wheat output has exceeded it by 40%. The autumn harvest in North China this year averages 80%, with an estimated grain output of 28.5 billion jin, an increase of 9% compared to last year, restoring 91% of the total output before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Henan Province's early autumn crops increased by 30% compared to last year. The average rice harvest in Hunan Province is 90%. The lake areas with the highest rice production in the province, as well as the Jianghan area of Hubei, the Poyang Lake area of Jiangxi, and parts of southern and northern Jiangsu, have excellent rice yields, with the highest yield per mu reaching 700 jin.

According to the government's plan, the national output of raw grain this year is 240 billion jin, an increase of 10 billion jin compared to last year. This task has now been completed and exceeded. The grain production this year has, on a national scale, recovered to 85.7% of the pre-war production volume. Our grain is now able to be completely self-sufficient.

In addition to grain, cotton is currently the most important crop in agricultural production. This year, the government's original planned cotton output was 13.28 million dan. Currently, new cotton is being picked and marketed in various places. According to the existing situation, in the 56.75 million mu of cotton fields—the national cotton planting area this year is over 60.25 million mu, excluding those affected by water, drought, insects, hail, and other disasters, where output cannot be guaranteed, as well as some abandoned cotton fields—it is estimated that 14 million dan of ginned cotton can be produced, an increase of more than 54% compared to last year's cotton output of 9 million dan. The original plan has been completed and exceeded, reaching 83% of the highest annual output before the war, exceeding the average output of the five years before the war (1933-1937) by more than 2 million dan. The five major cotton-producing provinces in North China are expected to produce about 6 million dan of cotton this year, restoring to the pre-war level. Among them, the cotton planting area and cotton output of Hebei Province have both exceeded the pre-war level. The national cotton output this year is roughly close to the needs of the nation's existing modern textile equipment, as well as hand spinning and cotton wadding.

Thus, the bumper harvest of the most important grain and cotton production in current agricultural production will have extremely important significance not only for agricultural production but also for the recovery and development of the entire national economy. Because agricultural production still occupies an absolute advantage in China's national economy, the recovery of agricultural production will greatly promote the recovery and development of other economic sectors.

II

How was this year's bumper harvest achieved? Was it a gift from nature? An accidental miracle? Or was it due to other reasons?

China has historically been a country with the most disasters. According to experts' statistics, from the 1st century to the 19th century AD, there were a total of 658 floods and 1,013 droughts within the customs, an average of 88 years of disasters in every 100 years. From 1912 to 1937, there were as many as 77 major disasters of various kinds. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and before liberation, various disasters were even more serious. Under the long-term enslavement of imperialism and feudal rule, the Chinese people not only suffered the cruel exploitation of the ruling class, but also frequently suffered the attacks of disasters. This also shows that disasters are not only formed by the laws of natural development, but also, more importantly, cultivated and manufactured by the reactionary rule that violates the interests of the people.

Of course, it has only been a year since the reactionary regime was overthrown and the whole country was liberated. Naturally, there are still many difficulties in eliminating long-term, historical famine all at once. This is reflected in the fact that some areas still experience disasters of varying sizes this year. However, today's handling of these disasters has undergone a fundamental change: the government has done its best to prevent and control them in advance, and has done its best to salvage them afterward, using all its strength to stop and reduce them. Therefore, in this situation, the bumper harvest we have achieved is not an accidental miracle, but a hard-won fruit of battle. That is to say, the reasons for this year's bumper harvest, in addition to some natural conditions such as relatively good weather, are mainly due to:

First: The entire country, except for Taiwan and Tibet, has been completely liberated. The revolution has achieved a basic victory throughout the country. In addition, after large-scale suppression of bandits and local bullies, the consistent obstruction and destruction of production by the past reactionary rule has basically stopped or greatly weakened. The expansion and consolidation of grassroots regimes, the universal establishment of revolutionary order throughout the country, and the lifting of war service in most areas, and the general reduction of the people's burden have created an unprecedentedly stable and favorable social environment for the hardworking farmers of the whole country, and provided objective conditions for engaging in intensive cultivation and getting rich. Therefore, the victory of the revolution is the earliest and most important condition for the national bumper harvest.

Second: The land reform in the old liberated areas and the rent reduction and interest rate reduction policy in the newly liberated areas are another important reason for this year's bumper harvest. As a result of the land reform in the old areas, the land has returned to the hands of the farmers themselves. The producers and the means of production are truly combined. The farmers have become the masters of the land and the owners of the products. This will inevitably unleash their production enthusiasm, which has been consistently suppressed and bound throughout history, to an unprecedented degree. The policy of rent reduction and interest rate reduction in the new areas has also initially reduced the burden on farmers, guaranteeing that a certain amount of farmers' surplus labor will no longer be exploited, and starting to provide favorable conditions for improving farmers' lives and expanding agricultural reproduction, which has greatly improved farmers' production enthusiasm.

Third: The government's emphasis on and active leadership and assistance to agricultural production has a decisive effect on this year's bumper harvest. At the beginning of this year, the Central People's Government and governments at all levels, with almost overwhelming force, in various regions—old areas, new areas, and disaster areas—through various specific measures, systematically and step-by-step implemented the policy of supporting farmers and rewarding agricultural production. Governments at all levels set plans in advance, grasped every link of agricultural production, and called on farmers to cultivate and sow early, apply more fertilizers, and cultivate and hoe more, by building water conservancy projects, lending seeds, fertilizers and farm tools, preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, stipulating that whoever sows will reap, and reasonable grain and cotton price ratios, especially advocating organization, implementing mutual aid in labor, mobilizing women to participate in labor, solving the practical difficulties encountered by farmers in the production process, and ensuring the smooth progress of agricultural production, thereby creating a national bumper harvest situation.

Fourth: In terms of overcoming disasters: especially important is the construction of water conservancy projects, because the most important disaster in agricultural production at present is still floods. Starting from last winter, the government led 4.69 million people to carry out unprecedentedly large water conservancy projects, among which the earthwork completed in flood control projects alone was more than 360 million cubic meters. If each earthwork is connected, it can circle the earth more than nine times! This is an unprecedentedly huge river management project in Chinese history, which has greatly reduced the degree of disasters.

Fifth: Cities supported the countryside, and science and technology began to serve agriculture, which is reflected in seed selection, seed soaking, protecting draught animals, improving farm tools, especially in preventing and eliminating diseases and insect pests. This year, the government promoted improved varieties of food crops on more than 4.6 million mu (excluding the Northeast), and improved varieties of cotton were expanded to more than 10 million mu. More than 6 million cattle were treated for cattle plague and anthrax; new farm tools were sent to the countryside in large numbers. Taking the Northeast as an example, 47,500 sets were promoted this year. In terms of disease and pest control, the People's Government led 1.75 million farmers in Xinjiang, Henan and other provinces to wipe out locusts in 117 counties. Zhejiang, Fujian, southern Jiangsu and other places also launched a large-scale stem borer hunting campaign, collecting more than 10 million stem borer eggs and capturing more than 390 million stem borer moths. This year, the government lent out 605 tons of agricultural drugs and 54,000 sprayers in North China, East China and Northeast China. These are undoubtedly powerful conditions for reducing losses and creating bumper harvests.

Sixth: The vast number of hardworking farmers in the country, especially the millions of heroic People's Liberation Army soldiers, fought day and night to improve production in a stable environment under the leadership and assistance of the government. Thousands of labor models who appeared on the production front played a leading and backbone role, educating and improving farmers' enthusiasm and overcoming various difficulties. Therefore, the active participation of all working people in production is undoubtedly one of the important reasons for this year's bumper harvest.

III

From the above explanation, it is not difficult for us to understand that this year's national bumper harvest is not accidental. For the first good year after the people established their own regime, its significance is particularly worthy of our cherishing. From the above reasons for this year's bumper harvest, it is not difficult to see that the significance of this year's bumper harvest is mainly as follows:

First of all, this year's bumper harvest is different from all the bumper harvests in history. This year's bumper harvest is mainly not due to the gift of nature, but due to the fact that the people's own government has led hardworking people in a planned, organized, and step-by-step manner to overcome natural disasters. Although the weather in some areas this year is relatively favorable, this alone cannot create a national or even regional bumper harvest like this year. On the other hand, the rainfall in some areas this year was particularly heavy and concentrated, but except for the Huai River, all rivers in the country were basically safe, and the disaster situation was greatly reduced compared to last year. In addition, some areas did experience rainfall imbalances, but due to the construction of irrigation projects, opening canals and building dams, digging wells to divert water, and lending waterwheels, the degree of drought was also greatly reduced. The prevention and elimination of diseases and insect pests has developed into a large-scale mass action. This year, considerable areas were affected by stem borer and cotton aphid disasters, but most of them were eventually eliminated. For example, in order to focus on picking stem borer eggs and wiping out stem borer moths, the Zhejiang Provincial Government issued a special mobilization order on May 11 this year, calling on "everyone to take action, every family to eliminate insects," and wiped out the insect pests in the province. Thus, on a national scale, it is not that there were no water, drought, and insect disasters this year, but that these disasters were weakened or stopped due to correct leadership! Therefore, the bumper harvest is the result of a great struggle against natural disasters. The era of "relying on the sky for food" will gradually pass, and we have begun to enter a new era of "man will conquer nature."

Secondly, this year's bumper harvest will no longer be a disaster for the vast number of farmers like before liberation, but will become the basis for farmers to improve their lives and expand reproduction. In the old society, if there was a bumper harvest, it would only benefit landlords and merchants. Impoverished farmers were forced to sell grain at low prices or offset debts in order to repay debts to landlords and commercial usurers. Before winter came, they were forced to borrow high-interest loans to buy expensive grain from the landlords' and merchants' granaries. The bumper harvest thus became a disaster for the farmers. Today's situation is fundamentally different. The products earned by hard work are now owned by the farmers themselves. In addition to leaving enough food, the part that must be taken to the market for exchange is guaranteed by the government's correct price policy, ensuring the interests of farmers and preventing the phenomenon of "cheap grain hurting farmers" from happening again. Therefore, due to this year's bumper harvest, the vast number of farmers will be basically free from the threat of starvation, and most farmers will be able to initially improve their lives and expand their reproduction. This is the fundamental difference between the bumper harvest in the new society and the old society.

Finally: This year's bumper harvest not only brings happiness to the vast number of farmers, but also brings good news to people of all classes throughout the country. Because agricultural production accounts for a large proportion of China's economy today, the recovery of agriculture is of great significance to the recovery and development of the entire national economy. Therefore, the bumper harvest of agriculture will bring prosperity to industry and commerce. This is first reflected in the fact that there is enough grain to eat in the country, and the cotton is not far from actual needs, initially reaching the point of "sufficient food and clothing." We no longer need to import large amounts of grain and cotton from imperialists as before, and in just one year, we have basically solved the grain problem and the raw material problem for the textile industry, a major light industry in China, with our own strength. Secondly, farmers' income has increased, and their purchasing power for urban industrial products has also increased accordingly. This has opened up a large and reliable sales market for legitimate national industry and commerce, which will greatly promote the development of urban industry and commerce, thereby revitalizing the financial, transportation and other economic sectors, and promoting the overall national economy to improve. That is to say, this year's bumper harvest benefits the working people of the whole country, including industrialists and businessmen. Our situation will get better day by day.

IV

This year's bumper harvest is a cause for celebration, but the problem cannot be limited to celebration. We must promptly summarize the experience and lessons of this bumper harvest, and strive for a greater bumper harvest next year on the basis of this year's bumper harvest. This is entirely possible, but we must also work hard in the following aspects:

First: Due to this year's bumper harvest, some farmers have developed some complacency, which will hinder the development of production. Some behaviors of eating and drinking extravagantly, such as inviting people to wine and watching operas, carrying Bodhisattvas, and celebrating "cotton peaches," improperly consume the surplus grain earned by hard work, hindering the accumulation of funds, thereby hindering the expansion of reproduction next year. The idea of ​​not paying attention to thrift and not making long-term plans must be overcome. We should explain to the farmers that this year's agricultural production has achieved results, but it has not yet recovered to the pre-war level, and industrial production is still waiting for the gradually recovered and developed agricultural production to accumulate and increase funds. Under conditions, some improvement in farmers' lives is possible and should be. Improving farmers' lives is one of the main contents of the country's economic improvement, and it is also greatly conducive to the improvement of the entire economy. However, only by improving future production can there be sufficient guarantee for improving lives. Therefore, it is most important to further improve production. At present, we must seize the opportunity and carry out autumn cultivation and autumn planting as early as possible.

Second: Today, the awareness of the vast majority of farmers in the countryside has been improved, but muddled thinking of being lazy, content with poverty, and even taking poverty as glory, the agricultural socialist thinking of "eating from the same pot," "joining the big heap," "sooner or later we will have communism," as well as the capitalist thinking of abandoning the leadership of the working class and letting it develop on its own, all exist and even grow in the new countryside, and we must fight against these incorrect ideas. The most concrete manifestation of these ideas is that the idea of ​​organizing and becoming rich through labor has not been clarified. Naturally, this also includes many quite complex problems that accompany the lifting of war service and the recovery and development of agricultural production, but this is indeed a new problem in the countryside today. We must repeatedly explain to the farmers that China's vast individual economy not only needs to be organized during the recovery period, that is, not only during the period when small producers are rescued from poverty, but also needs to gradually strengthen the collective organizational strength in the process of agricultural production development. This is precisely the law of social development. Of course, today farmers can work on their own because production conditions have improved, and it is also allowed. However, if we improve, change, and enrich the content of organization at any time according to the development of productive forces, and prove with concrete facts that organization can produce more grain than working on one's own, farmers will definitely take this path.

Third: Land reform is a powerful weapon for liberating agricultural productive forces and is also an important condition for ensuring a bumper harvest. Therefore, in order to ensure a bumper harvest next year, it is necessary to complete the land reform in the areas scheduled to implement land reform according to the scheduled plan. Areas that do not have time to carry out land reform this year must continue to reduce rent and thoroughly eliminate bandits and local bullies, creating a more stable and favorable production environment than this year.

Fourth: For the battle against natural disasters, we should seize this year's concrete and vivid facts, educate farmers, and improve confidence, so that next year's disasters will be greatly reduced compared to this year. On the other hand, all excellent seeds, new farm tools, and advanced farming methods should be widely promoted and popularized in agricultural production, that is, all modern science and technology should be further integrated with agricultural production, go deep into the countryside, and serve farmers. In addition to increasing output, next year's production should pay more attention to improving quality (especially in terms of cotton). Therefore, we must pay attention to varieties, carry out field selection, and soak seeds in warm water, and strive to achieve the goal of popularizing improved varieties throughout the country in the next five years. The improvement of farm tools and farming methods can not only improve agricultural technology by one step, but also gradually free up some labor in agricultural production to supplement the needs of urban industrial development.

Fifth: In order to encourage farmers' production and ensure a bumper harvest next year, farmers must be able to sell their surplus products at reasonable prices. Therefore, the existing scissors-shaped price difference between industrial and agricultural products, although it is a historical problem, cannot be eliminated immediately. However, we must prevent the expansion of the scissors-shaped price difference through correct price policies, and further make appropriate adjustments. This problem is very complicated and involves a wide range. First of all, we should improve the relationship between urban and rural areas, and through state-owned trading institutions, cooperatives, and encouraging legitimate merchants, work together to carry out mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, ensuring that farmers can sell surplus grain at reasonable prices and can purchase the necessary production tools and means of livelihood at reasonable prices. This is undoubtedly an important work to encourage farmers' production enthusiasm and strive for a bumper harvest next year.

This year's bumper harvest is a great victory on the agricultural production front. This victory was hard-won, and it is worthy of cherishing by the people of the whole country. However, we cannot be satisfied with this. To transform China from a poor and backward country into a progressive and prosperous country, we especially need to make greater efforts in agricultural production at present, and we need to fight for a great bumper harvest in national agricultural production year after year.

　　粮棉丰收的原因及其意义
    石础
    一
    今年全国农业，除了极少数地区，因为未能完全克服大小不同的灾害而歉收以外，一般都是丰收。这是新中国农业生产战线上伟大的胜利。
    首先是全国小麦的收成，一般都是丰收的。全部小麦的产量比去年大大地增加了，这里一部分虽然是由于扩充播种面积的结果，但主要的是由于单位产量的普遍提高。有些地区的丰收情形，竟为二十年来所未有，例如福建各地平均每亩产量为一百三十斤至一百五十斤，也有高达二百五十斤的。
    秋收情形更令人兴奋，全国各地粮食秋收，一般都在八成或八成以上，比去年增产了一成到三成。东北全区为九成，其中松江、吉林年景最好，可达十成，超过一般的丰收年成。东北全区今年总产量，估计可达一千七百八十二万吨，超过原订计划产量百分之六，比去年要增产两成多，今年东北水稻总产量已经超过伪满时期最高产量百分之二十九，小麦总产量已超过百分之四○；华北今年秋收平均可达八成，约可产粮二百八十五亿斤，比去年增产百分之九，已恢复到抗战前总产量的百分之九十一；河南省早秋作物比去年增产三成；湖南水稻全省平均可收九成，该省产米最多的滨湖区域，以及湖北的江汉地区、江西的鄱阳湖地区和苏南苏北部分地区，产稻极好，每亩最高可收七百斤。
    按照政府所订计划，今年全国生产原粮二千四百亿斤，比去年增产一百亿斤，这个任务，目前是已经完成并且超过了，今年的粮食生产，在全国范围内已经恢复到战前生产量的百分之八十五点七，我们的粮食已经能够完全自给了。
    除了粮食以外，在农业生产中，棉花是目前最重要的作物，今年政府原订棉花的计划产量为一千三百二十八万担，目前各地新花已纷纷采摘上市，依照现有情形看来：在五千六百七十五万亩棉地上——今年全国棉花播种面积为六千零二十五万余亩，其中须除去因受水、旱、虫、雹等灾害，产量不能保证的以及一部分废弃的棉田在外——估计可产皮棉一千四百余万担，与去年产棉九百余万担相较，增加了百分之五十四以上。完成并超过了原定的计划，已达到战前最高年产量的百分之八十三，较战前五年（一九三三——一九三七）的平均产量超过二百万担以上，而全国主要的植棉区域华北五省，今年约产棉花六百万担，已经恢复到战前水平，其中河北省的植棉面积与棉花产量则都已经超过了战前的水平。今年全国棉花产量，与全国现有的现代化纺织设备以及手纺、棉胎等的需要，大体上已经相去不远。
    这样，当前农业生产中最主要的粮棉生产，这一丰收将不仅对于农业生产，而且对于整个国民经济的恢复和发展上，有着极其重大的意义。因为农业生产在中国国民经济中，目前还占着绝对的优势，农业生产的恢复，将大大地推动其他经济部门的恢复与发展。
    二
    今年的丰收是怎样造成的呢？是自然的赐予吗？是偶发的奇迹吗？还是由于其他原因得来的呢？
    中国历史上是一个灾害最多的国家，根据专家的统计：中国自公元一世纪至十九世纪，关内共计发生过水灾六百五十八次，旱灾一千零十三次，平均每一百年当中有八十八年受灾。从一九一二年到一九三七年这二十六年当中，各种大灾害就有七十七次之多，抗战期间与解放前各种灾害更为严重。中国人民在长期的帝国主义的奴役与封建统治下，除了受统治阶级残酷的剥削外，还经常遭受灾害的袭击，这也说明了灾害不仅由于自然发展的规律所形成，同时更重要的是违反人民利益的反动统治所培养与制造成功的。
    当然，反动政权刚刚被推翻，全国获得解放才一年，要一下子消灭长期的、历史性的灾荒，自然还有许多困难的；这表现在今年若干地区依旧发生或大或小的灾害。但是，今天对于这些灾害的处理方法，却已经有了基本的变化：政府在事前极力防治了，事后极力挽救了，用一切力量，使它停止缩小。因此，在这种情形下，我们所获得的丰收，并不是偶发的奇迹，而是难能可贵的战斗的果实，即是说，造成今年丰收的原因，除了在大体上比较风调雨顺等一些自然的条件外，主要的却是由于：
    第一：全国除台湾、西藏以外，已经全部获得解放，革命已经在全国获得基本胜利，再加上经过大规模的清匪反霸，过去反动统治一贯的对于生产的阻挡与破坏，已经基本上停止或大大地减弱了。基层政权的扩大与巩固，革命秩序在全国范围内的普遍建立，以及战争勤务在绝大地区已经解除，人民负担的普遍减轻，这就为全国勤劳的农民创造了一个空前安定的、有利于生产的优良的社会环境，提供了从事精耕细作，发家致富的客观条件。因此，革命的胜利，便是全国丰收最先的与最重要的条件。
    第二：老解放区的土地改革与新解放区的减租退租政策，是造成今年丰收的另一个重要的原因。老区土地改革的结果，土地回到了农民自己的手里，生产者与生产手段真正结合起来，农民既成了土地的主人与生产品的所有者，这就必然掀起他们从历史上一贯被压制着与束缚着的生产积极性，发挥到空前无比的程度。在新区的减租减息政策，也初步地减轻了农民的负担，保证了农民一定的剩余劳动不再被剥削，开始为改善农民生活与扩大农业再生产提供了有利的条件，也大大地提高了农民的生产情绪。
    第三：政府对于农业生产重视与积极领导扶助，对于今年的丰收是有决定性的作用的。今年一开头，中央人民政府与各级人民政府，几乎以压倒一切的力量，在各个不同的地区——老区、新区、灾区——通过各种具体的措施，有计划，有步骤地贯彻了扶助农民，奖励农业生产的政策，各级政府事前纷纷定出计划，抓紧农业生产的每一个环节，通过兴修水利，贷放种子肥料农具，防治病虫害，规定谁种谁收，以及合理的粮棉比价等办法及时号召农民早耕早播，多上肥料，多铲多趟，特别是提倡组织起来，实行劳动互助，动员妇女参加劳动，解决了农民在生产过程中所发生的实际困难，保证了农业生产的顺利进行，从而造成了全国丰收的局面。
    第四：在战胜灾害这方面来说：特别重要的是水利的兴修，因为目前农业生产中最主要的灾害还是水灾。政府从去年冬天开始，领导了四百六十九万人民，进行了空前巨大的水利工程，其中仅防洪工程一项所完成的土方，就有三亿六千余万公方。如果拿每一个土方连接起来，可以绕全地球九周以上！这是中国历史上空前巨大的治河工程，大大地减低了灾害的程度。
    第五：城市支援了农村，科学技术开始为农业服务，这表现在选种、浸种，保护耕畜，改良农具，特别是防治与扑灭病虫害方面。今年政府共推广良种食粮四百六十余万亩，（不包括东北）良种棉花扩展至一千余万亩，防治牛瘟和朱炭疽六百余万头；新式农具更纷纷下乡，以东北为例，今年即推广了四万七千五百余具，在防治病虫害方面，人民政府曾领导新疆河南等省一百七十五万农民，扑灭了一百十七县的蝗虫。浙江、福建、苏南等地也展开了大规模的捕螟运动，采螟卵一千余万块，捕获螟蛾三亿九千余万只；今年政府在华北、华东与东北三区，共贷出农用药物六○五吨，喷雾器五万四千余架，这些无疑的都是减少损失，造成丰收的有力条件。
    第六：全国广大的勤劳的农民。特别是千百万英勇的解放军，在全国安定的环境中，在政府的领导与帮助下，日以继夜地为提高生产而斗争，出现在生产战线上成千成万的劳动模范，更起了带头与骨干作用，教育与提高了农民的积极性，战胜了各种不同的困难。因此，全体劳动人民的积极参加生产，无疑的也是造成今年丰收的重要原因之一。
    三
    从以上的说明中，我们不难明了：今年全国的丰收并不是偶然的。对于人民建立了自己的政权以后的第一个好年景，它的意义是特别值得我们珍视的，从上述造成今年丰收的原因中，不难看出今年丰收的意义，主要是这样的：
    首先，今年的丰收与历史上所有过的丰收不同，今年的丰收主要并不是由于自然的恩赐，而是由于人民自己的政府有计划、有组织、有步骤地领导勤劳的人民，战胜了自然的灾害，今年某些地区虽然比较上风调雨顺，但单是这一点是不能造成像今年这样全国性甚至一个地区的丰收的。而在另一方面，今年某些地区的雨量特别多而集中，但是，除了淮河以外，全国各河流却在基本上没有出险，比去年的灾情大为减轻；此外，某些地区是曾经发生雨量失调的，但是由于灌溉工程的兴修，开渠筑坝，打井引水，贷放水车，也大大地减轻了旱灾的程度；对于病虫害的防治与扑灭，更发展成为大规模的群众性的行动，今年有相当大的地区发生螟虫棉蚜虫的灾害，但结果大都被先后扑灭了。例如上述浙江省政府为了突击采摘螟卵，扑灭螟蛾，于今年五月十一日颁发了特别动员令，号召“人人动手，家家除虫”，扑灭了该省的虫害。这样，在全国范围内，今年并不是没有水、旱、虫灾，而是由于正确的领导，使这些灾害减弱了或停止了！因此，丰收是向自然的灾害进行了巨大的斗争的结果。“靠天吃饭”的时代将逐渐过去，我们已经开始进入“人定胜天”的新时代。
    其次，今年的丰收也不再像解放前一样，成为广大农民的灾难，而成为农民改善生活与进行扩大再生产的基础。在旧社会中，如果遇到丰收，只是对于地主商人有利，贫困的农民为了偿还地主和商业高利贷者的债务，便被迫将粮食以贱价出卖或抵债，转瞬不到冬季，又被迫借入高利贷款去购买地主商人谷仓里高价的粮食，丰收就这样成了农民的灾难。今天的情形却基本上不同了，勤劳所得的生产品，已经归农民自己所有，他们除了留下足够的食粮以外，必须拿到市场上去交换的部分，则由于政府正确的价格政策，保证农民的利益，不致再造成“谷贱伤农”的现象。因此，由于今年的丰收，广大的农民将在基本上解除饥饿的威胁，大部分农民则已经可以初步改善他们的生活，扩大他们的再生产，这是新社会与旧社会丰收根本不同的地方。
    最后：今年的丰收不仅为广大的农民带来了幸福，也为全国各阶级人民带来了喜讯。由于农业生产在今天中国经济中占有绝大的比重，农业的恢复对于整个国民经济的恢复与发展有其十分重大的意义。因此，农业的丰收将带来工商业的繁荣，这里首先是表现在全国的粮食够吃了，棉花与实际需要已相去不远，初步地达到了“足食足衣”的地步，我们不需要再像以前一样，从帝国主义手里输入大量的粮食与棉花，而在短短的一年中，以自己的力量，基本上解决了粮食问题与中国主要轻工业中纺织工业的原料问题。其次是农民的收入增加了，他们对于城市工业品的购买力也随着提高起来，这就为正当的民族工商业市场打开了广大可靠的销路，将大大地促进城市工商业的发展，从而使金融、交通各经济部门都活跃起来，推动整个国民经济走向好转，即是说今年的丰收使全国劳动人民以至工商业家都能得到好处，我们的光景将一天比一天地好起来。

    今年的丰收是一件值得庆幸的事，但是，问题不能只限于庆幸而已。我们必须及时总结这一丰收的经验与教训，在今年这一丰收的基础上，进一步争取明年更大的丰收，这是充分可能的，但是，我们还必须从下列各方面去努力：
    第一：由于今年的丰收，部分农民已经产生了若干自满的情绪，这将妨碍生产的发展。某些大吃大喝，铺张浪费的行为，例如请酒演戏，抬菩萨，庆祝“棉花桃”等，把辛勤所得的剩余谷物，作不当的消耗，妨碍了资金的积累，从而也就妨碍了明年扩大再生产的进行，这种不注意节约，不作长远打算的思想，是必须加以克服的。我们应该向农民说明：今年的农业生产是有成绩的，但是还没有恢复到战前的水准，而且工业生产还等待逐渐恢复和发展了的农业生产来积累和增加资金。在条件许可情况下，农民生活的某些改善是可以而且应该的，农民生活的改善是国家经济好转的主要内容之一，同时，也大大有利于整个经济的好转，不过，只有把今后的生产搞好了，生活的改善才有充分的保障。因此，进一步搞好生产，才是最最重要的事。目前必须抓紧时机，赶早进行秋耕秋种。
    第二：今天农村中绝大多数农民的觉悟程度是提高了，但是，好吃懒做，安于贫穷，甚至以贫穷为光荣的糊涂思想，“吃大锅饭”，“合大堆”，“早晚得共了产”等空想的农业社会主义思想，以及放弃工人阶级领导，任其自流发展的资本主义思想，都在新的农村中存在着甚至成长着，必须同这些不正确的思想进行斗争。这些思想最具体的表现在对于组织起来，劳动致富这一思想没有弄明确。这里自然还包含着许多伴随着战争勤务解除农业生产恢复发展而来的相当复杂的问题，但这确是今天农村中的新问题。必须向农民反复解释：中国广大的个体经济，不仅在恢复时期，即不仅在把小生产者从贫困中挽救出来的时期，需要组织起来，在农业生产发展的过程中，更需要逐渐加强集体的组织力量，这正是社会发展的规律。当然，今天农民因为生产条件改善了，单干是可能的同时也是被允许的。但是，我们如果把组织起来的内容，随时按照生产力的发展而提高、变化、丰富起来，用具体的事实证明：组织起来要比单干多打粮食，农民是一定会走到这一条道路上来的。
    第三：土地改革是解放农业生产力强有力的武器，也是保证丰收的重要条件之一，因此，为了保证明年的丰收，在预定实行土改的地区，按照预定计划完成土地改革是必要的。今年还来不及进行土改的地区，必须继续进行减租与彻底肃清土匪恶霸，造成比今年更安定更有利的生产环境。
    第四：对于战胜自然的灾害，应该抓紧今年具体生动的事实，教育农民，提高信心，使明年的灾害比今年大大地减轻。另一方面，一切优良的种子，新式的农具，以及进步的耕作方法，应该在农业生产中普遍的提倡与推广，即一切现代的科学技术，应该进一步与农业生产结合，深入农村，为农民服务。明年的生产应该在产量的增加外，更注意品质的提高（特别是棉花方面），因此，必须注意品种，进行田间选种，温汤浸种，争取在今后五年内全国实现普及良种的计划。农具与耕作方法的改进，不仅可以使农业技术提高一步，同时，也可使农业生产中逐渐腾出一部分劳动力，补充城市工业发展的需要。
    第五：为了鼓励农民生产与保证明年的丰收，必须使农民的剩余生产品能够以合理的价格出卖。因此，目前存在着的工农业产品间的剪刀状价格差，虽然因为它是一个历史性的问题，还不可能马上消灭。但是，我们必须通过正确的价格政策，首先防止剪刀状价格差的扩大，进一步作适当的调整。这个问题是很复杂的，牵涉的范围也很广，这里首先应该改善城乡关系，通过国营贸易机构、合作社、并鼓励正当商人，一齐动手，进行城乡互助，保证农民能够以合理的价格出售余粮与能够以合理的价格购买到他们所必需的生产工具与生活资料，这无疑的也是鼓励农民生产情绪争取明年丰收的重要工作之一。
    今年的丰收是农业生产战线上的伟大胜利，这一胜利是经过千辛万苦得来的，它是值得我们全国人民珍视的。但是，我们还不能以此为满足，要把中国从贫困落后改造成为进步富强的国家，在目前特别需要在农业生产方面作更大的努力，需要为争取全国农业生产一年紧接一年的大丰收而斗争。
