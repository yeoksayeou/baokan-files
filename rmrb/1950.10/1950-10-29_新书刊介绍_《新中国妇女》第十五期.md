New Book Introduction
    "New Chinese Women" Issue 15
    "New Chinese Women" Issue 15 has been published. This issue, a special edition commemorating the first anniversary of National Day, includes "A Little Experience in Participating in the Work of the People's Government" by Shi Liang, Minister of Justice of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, and "How I Undertook New Work" by Zhang Qinqiu, Deputy Minister of the Textile Industry Department of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. The selected essays also include "From Virtuous Wife and Good Mother to People's Representative" by Mr. Liu Musan. We believe these three articles are very good: (1) Minister Shi Liang's article reflects how they work in the People's Government. As someone who had been a lawyer for more than ten years, people used to seek her out, but now she learns how to serve the people and follow the mass line. It especially introduces the improvement of prison administration under the leadership of the People's Government. (2) Deputy Minister Zhang Qinqiu's article explains how veteran cadres who have been engaged in the revolution for many years have undertaken new work they have never done before. She undertakes new work tasks with the spirit of "a revolutionary should not be afraid of difficulties, especially a Communist Party member should have the perseverance to overcome difficulties" and be good at uniting the masses. (3) The article written by Liu Musan describes how a housewife in her fifties initially heard rumors and was afraid of the Communist Party, but later gradually believed in the Communist Party after many facts proved it, and finally served the people and became a people's representative through various movements and studies.

　　新书刊介绍
    《新中国妇女》第十五期
    《新中国妇女》十五期已出版了，该刊在纪念第一年国庆特辑内刊登了中央人民政府政务院司法部部长史良同志《参加人民政府工作的一点体会》及中央人民政府政务院纺织工业部副部长张琴秋同志《我怎样担负起新的工作》。在征文选刊上又登了刘慕参先生《从贤妻良母到当人民代表》等文章，我们认为这三篇文章很好：（一）史良部长的文章里反映了她们在人民政府内是如何的工作，担任了十余年律师的人过去一向是人家去求她，而现在又如何的学习为人民服务，学习走群众路线。特别介绍了在人民政府领导之下狱政工作的改善。（二）张琴秋副部长的文章里说明革命多年的老干部担负起了从未担任过的新工作，她本着“一个革命者不要怕困难，特别是共产党员要有克服困难的毅力”及善于团结群众的精神去担负起新的工作任务。（三）在刘慕参所写的文章里说明一个五十余岁的家庭妇女，最初听了谣言，害怕共产党，后来经过许多事实证明而逐渐的相信共产党，最后经过了各种运动及学习，而为人民服务，成为人民代表。
