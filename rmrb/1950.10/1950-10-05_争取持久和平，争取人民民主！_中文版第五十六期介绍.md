Xinhua News Agency, October 3rd: "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition, Issue 56 (Total Issue 95) has been published.

　　The editorial in this issue is: "The Struggle of the Peoples of Southeast Asia for Freedom and National Independence." The editorial first analyzes the development of the national liberation movements of various ethnic groups in Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam, Malaya, Burma, and Indonesia, and points out that in order to contain the liberation movements of the peoples of Southeast Asia, American imperialism has shifted from preparing for aggression to taking direct aggressive actions. The editorial points out: The struggle for national liberation is an extremely necessary and sacred just cause for the peoples of Southeast Asia. Only armed resistance, only resolute armed struggle against foreign occupiers, domestic reactionaries, and those who betray the people can guarantee the national freedom and independence of Southeast Asian countries. The editorial continues: The great Chinese people have already set an excellent example of how to organize armed resistance against imperialist enslavers. Under the current circumstances, a successful national liberation movement can only be led by the working class and its vanguard—the Communist Party. Under the banner of the liberation struggle against brutal colonial rule and for in-depth democratic reforms, the working class unites all those who cherish the freedom and independence of their motherland, especially the peasants. The slogan of land reform against feudal ownership is also an anti-imperialist slogan, because it can mobilize the power of the people to oppose feudal leaders—the supporters of imperialism, and can mobilize millions of peasants who not only gain national liberation but also social liberation. The editorial points out: Although American imperialism has mobilized all the forces of world imperialism to oppose the national liberation movement, the morale of these colonial troops is low. They are mercenary troops, and the soldiers are far from their homes and fighting for irrelevant interests. The peoples of Southeast Asia, on the contrary, are fighting on their own land for their own vital interests. This is the source of their invincible strength. The people of the whole world, all freedom-loving humanity, will support the struggle of the peoples of Southeast Asia. Therefore, their struggle will surely achieve a complete victory.

　　This issue publishes a paper by Earl Browder, National Secretary of the Communist Party of the United States: "The Armed Aggression of American Imperialism in Korea." In his paper, Browder draws everyone's attention to an important new fact, namely, that American foreign policy and Wall Street's entire mad plan to dominate the world have entered a new stage characterized by open military intervention in the internal affairs of other countries and peoples. In his paper, Browder addresses the current tasks of the Communist Party of the United States in light of this new situation.

　　This issue also publishes an important paper by Walter Ulbricht, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany: "The Five-Year Plan of the German Democratic Republic." In addition, it also publishes papers by Renaud, of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, "The French Working People Insist on Their Urgent Demands," and by Passi, a member of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party, "The Working People of Genoa Fight for Peace, Work, and Freedom."

　　“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    中文版第五十六期介绍
    【新华社三日讯】“争取持久和平，争取人民民主!”中文版第五十六期（总第九十五期）已经出版。
    本期的社论是：“东南亚各族人民争取自由与民族独立的斗争。”社论首先分析了越南、马来亚、缅甸、印尼等东南亚各族的民族解放运动的发展，并指出了美帝国主义为遏止东南亚各族人民的解放运动，从准备侵略转而采取直接侵略的行动。社论指出：争取民族解放的斗争，对于东南亚各族人民来说，是一件极为必要的、神圣的正义的事业。只有武装抵抗，只有对外国占领者、对国内的反动派及出卖人民的人进行坚决的武装斗争才能保障东南亚各国的民族自由与独立。社论继称：伟大的中国人民已经做出了一个出色的榜样，应该怎样来组织对帝国主义奴役者的武装抵抗。在目前情形之下，要进行成功的民族解放运动，只能由工人阶级及其先锋队——共产党来领导。在反对残暴的殖民地统治、争取深入的民主改革的解放斗争的旗帜之下，工人阶级团结着一切珍惜祖国之自由与独立的人，首先是农民。反对封建所有制的土地改革的口号，也是一个反帝国主义的口号，因为它可以动员人民的力量来反对封建首领——帝国主义的拥护者，并且可以动员千百万不但得到民族解放而且得到社会解放的农民。社论指出：美帝国主义虽然动员世界帝国主义的一切力量来反对民族解放运动，但是这些殖民者的军队士气低落，他们是雇佣军队，士兵远离家乡为着不相干的利益而作战。东南亚的各族人民正相反，他们是在本国的土地上为着他们切身的利益而战。这是他们力量无敌的源泉。全世界人民，全体爱好自由的人类将支持东南亚各族人民的斗争。所以他们的这种斗争一定会取得彻底的胜利。
    本期刊登了美国共产党全国书记霍尔写的论文：《美帝国主义在朝鲜的武装侵略》。霍尔在论文中提请大家注意一个新的重要事实，即美国的外交政策以及华尔街整个的独霸世界的疯狂计划已经进入了一个以公开军事干涉其他国家和人民内政为特征的新阶段。霍尔在论文中针对这个新形势提出了美国共产党的当前任务。
    本期还刊登了德国统一社会党中央委员会书记乌布利希写的《德意志民主共和国的五年计划》的重要论文。另外，还登载了法国共产党中央委员会吕奈所写的《法国劳动人民坚持他们迫切的要求》、和意大利共产党中央委员会中央委员培西所写的《热那亚劳动人民为争取和平、工作和自由而斗争》等论文。
