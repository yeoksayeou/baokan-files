　　Post Office Facilitates People's Cashing of Remittances
	All Branches in the Same City Can Mutually Cash Them
	The Postal Administration of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, in order to facilitate the people's cashing of remittances, notified all post offices on October 13: All ordinary money orders and telegraphic money orders not exceeding 3 million yuan can be mutually cashed between branches in the same city. High-value money orders and telegraphic money orders exceeding 3 million yuan are limited to mutual cashing between branches handling high-value money orders within the same city. (Currently, all sub-branches in Beijing Municipality handle high-value money order business.)
	In addition, recently, post offices have received printed matter mailed by various government agencies, organizations, and publishing houses. The wrappers are often not sturdy, and some of the pasted slips with the recipient's name and address have excessively small handwriting. This makes them very susceptible to damage and becoming illegible during transit, resulting in failed delivery. It is hoped that senders will improve this to ensure that printed matter can be delivered securely.

　　邮局便利人民兑取汇款
    同一城市内各局可互相兑付
    邮电部邮政总局为便利人民兑取汇款起见，已于十月十三日通知各邮局：凡普通汇票及不超过三百万元的电报汇票，在同一城市内各局间，都可互相兑付。高额汇票及超过三百万元的电报汇票，限在同城市内办理高额汇票各局间互兑。（现北京市各支局均已办理高额汇票业务。）
    又，近来邮局收到各机关、团体、出版社交寄的印刷品，封纸多不结实，有的所贴收件人姓名住址之纸条，字迹太小，这样辗转寄递，极易破损模糊，以致造成无法投递。希望寄件人加以改善，使印刷品能稳妥投到。
