Continuing Efforts
    -- Chinese Writers in the Peace Signature Campaign
    Ding Ling

    Chinese New Literature, from its very inception, was filled with a righteous and solemn stance against feudalism and imperialism. For decades, Chinese writers, artists, and literary workers have never concealed their political outlook. In the past, under the threat of the Kuomintang's secret agents, bayonets, prisons, gallows, and bullets—the running dogs of imperialism—they used their pens to resist them, expose them, strike at their core, and organize the masses into the ranks of the revolution. Lu Xun was the best warrior and a great leader at that time. Later, in Chongqing, Guo Moruo, with the spirit of a mighty river, established the great banner of striving for resistance against Japan and for democracy, uniting the broad masses of intellectuals to wage an unyielding struggle against the compromising and fascist Kuomintang. Writers in the liberated areas, under the direction of Chairman Mao, delved into the masses, participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, land reform, and the increasingly important industrial construction, using literature and art as tools to serve the people, humbly and sincerely learning from the people, and achieving considerable success. In short, the breathing of Chinese writers and literary workers resonates with the broad masses of the people. They write what the people need, they are representatives of the broad masses, and they spread the voices of the people to the world!

    What do the Chinese people demand today? They demand the complete elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and oppose the United States' open aggression against Taiwan. But the Chinese people demand world peace even more, oppose wars of aggression, and oppose the US imperialist war of aggression against Korea. The Chinese people have already endured a century of anti-feudal and anti-imperialist wars. They understand best the disasters brought by war, hate war-mongers most, hate the imperialist policy of aggression most, and therefore understand best the power of the people uniting together. Our grandfathers and fathers have told us these experiences, but only since we had Marxism, the Communist Party, and Chairman Mao did we achieve victory and stand up. The Chinese people understand that to defend our victory and to seek the happiness of our lives, we must stand with the people of the world, hold high the banner of peace, and resolutely oppose wars of aggression. We are willing to stand at the forefront of the peace camp, shouldering this heavy responsibility under the leadership of the world's people's leader, Stalin.

    Therefore, Chinese writers, artists, and literary workers have once again taken up their pens to work for the cause of peace! Every day, the newspapers on my desk are filled with various essays, poems, and dramas, and the twenty-odd magazines on my bookshelf all have special editions dedicated to "Defending Peace." The famous poet Ai Qing, in his "I Sign the Peace Appeal," said:

    Four hundred and seventy-five million Chinese people,
    Everyone hates the criminals who create war,
    Everyone writes down their determination:
    "A peaceful world must not be violated!"

    He also vividly satirized Acheson's embarrassing travels in Britain and France in "A Shameful Journey," ending with:

    Whether in Paris or London,
    Acheson dares not go out,
    Hiding in a hole like a venomous snake,
    Or sneaking away like a rat.

    An undignified visit!
    A shameful journey!
    Those who peddle disaster are hated by everyone,
    Those who promote war are unwelcome everywhere.

    Ai Qing also has many other poems such as "Asians, Arise!"

    The poet Tian Jian also has "Sent to the Korean People" and "Written on the Peace Book." In his "Written on the Peace Book," he wrote:

    ………………
    The people have a command,
    Defeat the war criminals!

    On the road to peace,
    There are millions of warriors.

    Don't brag about how ruthless your knives and guns are,
    The gun and he are not of one mind.

    American aggressors,
    Your old dreams will not come true.

    The Ma Fantuo poet, who once wrote many political satirical poems in the style of mountain songs, also wrote "A Shameful Defeat."

    Bian Zhilin, Feng Zhi, Zang Kejia, Yan Chen, Li Yang, and Xu Chi, these cultivated poets, have all written many moving lines to inspire hearts that love peace and to toll the death knell for imperialism.

    Young poets are not willing to lag behind. Zhang Zhimin has "Signing My Name for Peace" to explain the Chinese people's desire for peace:

    Jingle, jingle!
    White doves carry small silver bells,
    Flying back and forth in the sky,
    Spreading "peace."

    The fruits in the garden are ripe and red,
    The green crops are good for harvesting,
    The newly built tile houses are just being constructed,
    The farmers want peace.

    The rusty machines are turning again,
    Lazy people are also transformed into production heroes,
    Everywhere, the songs of labor are sung,
    The workers want peace.

    The intense gunfire has just ceased,
    Demobilized soldiers want to return home,
    The study craze in the team is hotter than fire,
    The soldiers want peace...

    Lv Jian also has poems such as "Defend World Peace" and "Battle Song of the Asian People."

    It is not just the newspapers in Beijing, such as the People's Daily and Guangming Daily, and the Beijing magazines Wenyi Bao and People's Literature, that have made great efforts in this regard. Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Xi'an, and the Northeast are all doing the same. Northeast Literature and Art and Yangtze River Literature and Art both have many articles and poems by famous poets and novelists.

    We can also see from many poems how resolute, brave, and confident the commanders and fighters of the troops are, and how knowledgeable and enthusiastic the workers and peasants are. Zhou Fenzhi's "On Bloody Handprints" in the Southern Daily writes:

    ……………
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army!
    The resolute defender of New China,
    For the birth of the People's Republic of China,
    The soldiers once wrote letters of request to fight.

    The letters of request said:
    To completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang,
    To liberate all the Chinese people,
    Bloody handprints,
    Were pressed on the letters of request.

    Today, bloody handprints,
    Are again pressed on the peace declaration,
    The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army swear:
    ——Support world peace!

    The soldiers bit their fingers one by one,
    Signed their names and put their handprints on the declaration,
    Letting every name, every heart
    Connect with the people of the world.
    ………………………

    The honorary soldier Li Renhuan published his poem in the Qingdao Daily, saying:

    Two fingers on my left hand are crippled,
    An inch and a half is broken off my left leg,
    My body has lost its health;
    This is the disaster the heinous Japanese invaders, American imperialists, and Chiang Kai-shek brought me!
    My body has been destroyed, but my will to strive for peace will never change!
    …………………

    Hou Yiming, a worker at the Zhuolu Distillery, wrote in the Chahar Daily:

    A single strand of hemp has no strength,
    Many strands of hemp are knotted into a rope,
    If mad dogs dare to start a war,
    They are asking for their own death.
    ……………………
    I sign my name with strokes that are thick and large,
    To show my determination to love peace!
    ……………………
    We must use our practical actions,
    To express our will for peace,
    Everyone must step up production,
    Everyone must work diligently!
    …………

    Bi Yaocai's description of "The Peace Signature in Zhangzhuang Village" in the Hebei Daily is very vivid. I can only copy a section:

    …………
    Old Man Zhang with a pale beard,
    Walked into the meeting place and shouted:
    "Folks, make way,
    Let me sign my name!

    ………………
    My name is Zhang Yushan,
    I've carried long burdens and begged for food,
    Since the land reform, I've turned over a new leaf,
    一心一意搞生产。
    Imperialism wants to provoke war, that won't work!
    I'm not afraid of atomic bombs!
    Pick up the hoe,
    Fight back the American aggressors,
    My eldest son is a businessman,
    American planes dropped bombs,
    My eldest son suffered in Shijiazhuang,
    Died and his corpse was not found.
    My second son went to the front line in anger,
    To avenge his brother in Jiangnan.
    ……………………
    Old Man Zhang put down his pen and finished speaking,
    His daughter-in-law held his grandson behind him,
    His daughter-in-law called out:
    "Dad! Write my name down!
    Avenge my man!
    Dad! Remember to write down your grandson's name,
    His name is Victory!"

    Under the theme of defending peace, I truly don't know how many magnificent and beautiful poems have been written. Just in my hand (which is definitely not all), there are three hundred and twenty-seven poems, which I cannot introduce in detail. In addition to poetry, particularly powerful are many simple essays. Here, special mention should first be made of the short, mobilizing essays often written by veteran writers such as Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Ye Shengtao, and Zheng Zhenduo. Hu Feng, Huang Yaomian, Lao She, Zhao Shuli, Cao Jinghua, Li Jiye, Cai Chusheng, and Ding Ling have all expressed their efforts for the peace movement under various topics.

    I have seen thirty-six scripts. These short plays have been performed in various places and have moved audiences. Although these may not have perfect artistic merit in drama, they are all full of inflammatory atmosphere, igniting the hearts of the people with hatred and enthusiasm for supporting peace.

    What's more, these poems have been extended to the masses of the people in the form of songs and ballads. These new lyrics are sung in schools and factories; these ballads also wander through recreational grounds to the sound of drums and clappers. This is the creation of reformers and artists of the new Quyi.

    Of course, this is by no means all the works of writers and literary workers. Writers have written better and more complete creations, such as Xu Guangyao's "Fiery Plains," which depicts the anti-Japanese struggle in Hebei Central; Liu Baiyu's "Firelight Ahead," which depicts the People's Liberation War; and Li Gao's "Always Facing Forward" and Hu Ke's "Growing Up in Battle." These works are all beautiful achievements of the past year. Although these are themed on the People's Liberation War, their significance is also in opposing wars of aggression and supporting peace!

    There are many works depicting workers on the production front and the shift to production in rural areas, as well as new problems in new life, but this is not what I want to introduce in this short article. I only want to talk about the efforts made under the topic of defending peace and opposing war. Although they have the same effect, some works are even better than those I mentioned.

    Moreover, I cannot describe in detail the enthusiastic scenes and the excitement given to the masses in various places during the glorious travels of Xiao San and Ai Qing to several major cities to promote peace, which were deeply imprinted in the hearts of the people.

    Chinese writers, who have done their utmost for the rebirth of the motherland, will also step forward for the common demands of the people of the world, the cause of peace, unswervingly, and with continued efforts!

　　再接再厉
    ——中国作家在和平签名运动中
    丁玲
    中国的新文艺，当它出现时，就充满着反封建反帝国主义的正义的庄严的姿态的。中国的作家，艺术家，文艺工作者在几十年来，就从不掩饰他的政治面貌的。过去，在帝国主义的走狗国民党的特务、刺刀、牢狱、绞架、枪弹的威胁下曾经用笔反抗了他们，揭露了他们，击中了他们的要害，组织了群众到革命的队伍中来。鲁迅就是那时最好的战士，伟大的领头的人。后来在重庆，郭沫若又以其诗人的长江大河的气势，树立了争取抗战与民主的大旗，团结了广大的知识分子，向妥协的国民党，向法西斯化的国民党作不屈不挠的斗争。解放区的作家们则在毛主席的方向下，深入群众，参加抗日战争，解放战争，土地改革，与日益重要起来的工业建设，以文艺为服务于人民的工具，诚恳虚心地向人民学习，有了不少的成绩。总之中国的作家们，文艺工作者们，他们的呼吸是与广大的人民群众相呼应的。人民需要什么，他们就写什么，他们是广大人民的代表，他们就把人民的声音向世界传播！
    今天中国人民要求什么？要求彻底消灭蒋介石匪帮，反对美国公开侵略台湾。但中国人民更要求世界和平，反对侵略战争，反对美帝侵略朝鲜的战争。中国人民已经有了百年的反封建反帝的战争了，中国人民最懂得战争所带来的灾难，最仇恨战争贩子，最仇恨帝国主义的侵略政策，也就最懂得人民团结起来的力量。我们的祖父、我们的父亲就把这些经验告诉我们了，但我们自从有了马克思主义，共产党，毛主席，我们才得到了胜利，我们才站立了起来。中国人民明白，要保卫我们的胜利，要求得我们生活的幸福，我们只有和全世界的人民在一起，高举起和平的大旗，坚决反对侵略战争，我们愿意站在和平阵营的前列，在世界人民领袖斯大林领导下肩负这个重任。
    中国作家、艺术家、文艺工作者于是又拿起笔为拥护和平而努力了！每天送到我书桌上的报纸上有各式各样的散文、诗、戏剧，放在我书架上的二十几种杂志，都有“保卫和平”的特辑。著名的诗人艾青在他的“我在和平呼吁书上签名”就说到：
    中国人民四万万七千五百万，
    人人憎恨制造战争的罪犯，
    每个人都写上自己的决心：
    “和平的世界不许侵犯！”
    他又在“可耻的旅行”里十分讽刺地描写了艾奇逊在英国、法国的旅行的狼狈，结尾说：
    不论在巴黎还是伦敦，
    艾奇逊都不敢出门，
    像毒蛇一样躲在洞里，
    也好像耗子一样溜走。
　
    不体面的访问！
    可耻的旅行呵！
    贩卖灾难的人人憎恨，
    宣传战争的处处不欢迎。
　
    艾青还有“亚细亚人，起来！”等许多诗。
    诗人田间也有“寄朝鲜人民”，“写在和平书上”。他的“写在和平书上”上写道：
　
    ………………
    人民有号令，
    打败战争犯！
　
    和平大路上，
    勇士千万人。
　
    他别吹刀枪狠，
    枪和他不一心。
　
    美国侵略者，
    老梦作不成。
　
    曾经以山歌的体裁写过许多政治讽刺诗的马凡陀诗人也写了《可耻的失败》。
    卞之琳，冯至，臧克家，严辰，力扬，徐迟这些有修养的诗人们都写了很多动人的诗句，来鼓舞了爱和平的心和向帝国主义敲起丧钟。
    青年的诗人是不甘落后的，张志民有“为和平签上我的名”来说明中国人民的要和平：
　
    叮铃铃！叮铃铃！
    白鸽带着小银铃，
    来来往往飞天空，
    传播着“和平”。
　
    园里的果子结得红，
    绿油油的庄稼好收成，
    新盖的瓦房刚上栋，
    农人要和平。
　
    生了锈的机器又重转动，
    懒汉也改造成生产英雄，
    到处唱起劳动的歌声，
    工人要和平。
　
    激烈的枪声刚消停，
    复员战士要回家中，
    队上学习热潮比火红，
    军人要和平………
　
    吕剑也有了《保卫世界和平》和《亚洲人民战歌》等等的诗。
    不只北京的报纸，人民日报，光明日报，北京的杂志文艺报，人民文学在这方面尽了很大的努力。上海的，南京的，武汉，西安，东北都是这样。东北文艺，长江文艺，都有很多有名的诗人、小说家等的文章和诗。
    我们还可以从很多诗中看见部队指战员是如何的坚决勇敢和有信心，也可以看到工人和农民具有何等的认识和热情。在南方日报上周奋之的《血的手印上》这样写道：
　
    ……………
    中国人民解放军！
    新中国的坚决保卫者，
    为着中华人民共和国的诞生，
    战士们曾经纷纷写了请战书。
　
    请战书说：
    要彻底消灭蒋匪帮，
    要解放全中国人民，
    血的手印，
    纷纷按在请战书上。
　
    今天，血的手印，
    又按在和平宣言上，
    人民解放军的战士宣誓：
    ——拥护世界和平！
　
    战士们一个个咬破手指，
    在宣言上签名盖手印，
    让每一个名字，每一颗心
    和全世界人民连在一起。
    ………………………
　
    荣誉军人李人寰在青岛日报上发表他的诗，他说：
　
    我的左手伤残了两个指头，
    我的左腿折去了一寸半，
    我的身体失去了健康；
    这是罪恶滔天的日寇，美帝，蒋介石给我的灾难！
    身体受了摧残，但争取和平的意志永远不会变！
    …………………
　
    涿鹿酒厂工人侯一鸣在察哈尔日报上写道：
    一根麻丝没有劲，
    多根麻丝结成绳，
    疯狗们敢来发动战争，
    他就是自找死路。
    ……………………
    我这名字签的笔划粗又大，
    表示我爱和平的决心！
    ……………………
    要用我们的实际行动，
    表现我们的和平的意志，
    大家生产要加紧，
    大家工作要认真！
    …………
　
    河北日报毕耀彩在他描写的“张庄村的和平签名”是非常生动的，我只能抄下一段：
    …………
    苍白胡子张老汉，
    走进会场喊一声：
    “乡亲们，闪一闪，
    让我签上名！
　
    ………………
    姓张叫玉山，
    扛过长活，要过饭，
    土改以后把身翻，
    一心一意搞生产。
    帝国主义要想挑动战争，那可不沾！
    我不怕原子弹！
    拿起锄头，
    打退美国侵略者，
    我的大儿是个买卖人，
    美国飞机扔炸弹，
    大儿在石家庄遭了难，
    死了尸首都没见。
    二儿生气上前线，
    替兄报仇到江南。
    ……………………
    张老汉把笔放下话说完，
    儿媳妇抱着孙子在后边，
    儿媳妇叫一声：
    “爹！写上我！
    给我男人报仇恨！
    爹！记着写上你孙子的名字，
    他的名字叫胜利！”
    在保卫和平的题材下，真真不知写了多少雄壮的美丽的诗篇，仅仅在我手头的（这决不是全部）就有三百二十七篇，我无法详细的介绍。除了诗以外，特别有力的是很多简单的论文，在这里首先应该提到郭沫若，茅盾，叶圣陶，郑振铎等老作家经常带号召性的短论。胡风，黄药眠，老舍，赵树理，曹靖华，李霁野，蔡楚生，丁玲等都在各种的题目下表示了他们对和平运动的努力。
    剧本我看见到的有三十六篇，这些短戏，都曾在各地上演，观众们都为之感动，这些虽不是在戏剧上有完美的艺术性，但都充满了煽动气氛，燃起了人民的仇恨的心，及拥护和平的热情。
    更有把这些诗章推广到人民群众中去的，是歌曲和鼓词。在学校中，工厂中都唱着这些新词；在游艺场，在鼓板声中流荡着的也是这些鼓词，这是新曲艺改革者及艺人们的创作。
    当然，这决不是作家们文艺工作者们全部的作品，作家们写了更好的完整的创作，如徐光耀的描写冀中的抗日斗争的“平原烈火”，刘白羽的描写人民解放战争的“火光在前”，以及立高的“永远向着前面”，胡可等的“战斗里成长”，这些作品都是一年来的美丽的成果。这些虽说是以人民解放战争为主题，但它的意义，也就是反对侵略战争与拥护和平的！
    描写工人在生产战线上以及农村的转入生产，和新生活中的新问题的作品是非常之多的，但这都不是我这篇短文所要介绍的。我只想说在保卫和平反对战争这一个题目下所作的努力。虽然是有同样的作用，甚至有些作品是比我提到的更好。
    而且萧三和艾青为宣传和平而作的几个大城市的光荣旅行，那种热烈，那种所给与各地群众的激奋是深深印在人民群众心里的情景，我也无法细细地去描绘。
    中国的作家们，他们曾为祖国的新生尽了最大的力量，他们也会为世界人民共同的要求，和平事业而挺身向前，百折不回，再接再厉！
