To the Editor:

　　After the film "Victory of the Chinese People" was shown in fifteen major cities across the country, it was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of viewers and greatly boosted the production enthusiasm of the workers and peasants. For example, Comrade Zhang Qi, a worker at the Shenyang No. 52 Factory, expressed that after watching the film, he would work even harder, which is a clear demonstration of its impact. Therefore, I suggest that in the future, this film should not be limited to screenings in major cities, but should also reach factories, mines, and the vast countryside to exert a greater educational effect.

　　影片《中国人民的胜利》应深入到工农群众中去编辑同志：
    《中国人民的胜利》在全国十五个大城市演出后，获得了广大观众的热烈欢迎，并大大地鼓舞了工农群众的生产情绪。如沈阳五二工厂工人张琦同志，看过了这片子后，表示在工作上要干得更加起劲，便是一个显明的证明。因此，我建议今后这片子不应只限在各大城市放映，而且更要深入到各工厂、矿山及广大的乡村，以发挥更大的教育效果。
