　　Train Broadcasts Should Pay Attention to Propaganda Content
　　Letter from Comrade Jinyu

　　To the Editor:
　　On the 15th, when I was returning to Beijing from Datong by train, several comrades from the first train crew used "Shu Lai Bao" and "Taiping Lyrics" (both old folk art forms) to promote "Passenger Instructions" and "Sino-Soviet Friendship" during the train's journey. Judging from the situation of each performance, this was very popular with the passengers, especially the "Passenger Instructions," which told passengers how to abide by the regulations of the People's Railways, and it did indeed have a great effect on maintaining traffic order and reducing accidents. However, there are two points that need to be discussed regarding the "Taiping Lyrics" with Sino-Soviet friendship as the content: first, some of the individual words and sentences are incorrect, such as: "...Liberate Tibet and Taiwan, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits are finished, and the American imperialists are stunned, socialism is about to be realized." (The original sentence is not clearly remembered, the above is the general meaning). According to this content, it tells people that after the liberation of Tibet and Taiwan, it will be the eve of the implementation of socialism. This statement is incorrect.

　　Second, the content of the propaganda is not popular enough, such as the terms "October Revolution" and "Marxism-Leninism" in the "Sino-Soviet Friendship" Taiping Lyrics, which I am afraid most passengers will not understand.

　　I think the propaganda method adopted by the first train crew of the Datong Train Depot can be adopted and promoted. However, the content must be carefully studied, especially when publicizing policies, it must not be sloppy at all.

　　In addition, I suggest that the train crew should enrich the content of the propaganda and diversify the forms. In addition to "Shu Lai Bao" and "Taiping Lyrics," they can try reading newspapers, telling stories, etc. At the same time, they should pay attention to the target audience when publicizing (each train is divided into "children's car," "military car," and general passenger cars, etc.). If they can prepare more materials according to the target audience and use them flexibly, the effect will be even greater.

　　In order to make this work better, I hope that mass literary and artistic creators will create some short works for them, and spread the new folk art to the masses through the comrades of the train crew.

　　Jinyu, October 16th

### 列车广播应注意宣传内容  近宇同志来信

　　列车广播应注意宣传内容
    近宇同志来信编辑同志：
    我于十五日由大同乘车返京时，第一包乘组的几个工作同志在列车行进中用“数来宝”、“太平歌词”（都是旧曲艺形式）来宣传“旅客须知”和“中苏友好”。根据每次演唱情形来看，这是很受旅客欢迎的，特别是“旅客须知”，内容是告诉旅客怎样遵守人民铁路的规章，对维持行车秩序减少事故确有很大的作用。但在以中苏友好为内容的“太平歌词”中有两点是须要提出研究的：第一是个别词句意思有错误，如：“……解放西藏和台湾，蒋匪介石完了蛋，美帝一看也瞪了眼，社会主义将要实现。”（原句记不清，以上是大意）根据这一内容，告诉人们：解放西藏、台湾之后就到了实行社会主义的前夕了。这种说法是错误的。
    第二是宣传内容不够通俗，如“中苏友好”太平歌词中的“十月革命”、“马列主义”等名词恐怕多数乘客不会懂得。
    我认为大同车务段第一包乘组所采用的宣传方式是可以采用和推广的。但在内容上一定要经过慎重的研究，特别是宣传政策时更是丝毫不能草率。
    另外我建议包乘组在宣传内容上应该更丰富些，形式也要更多样些，除“数来宝”、“太平歌词”以外可以试行读报、讲故事等。同时在宣传时要看对象（每次列车中以车厢区分有“小孩车”、“军人车”和一般乘客车等），若能根据对象多准备些材料机动使用，效果还会增大。
    为使这一工作作得更好，我希望大众文艺创作工作者为他们创作些简短的作品，通过包乘组的工作同志把新曲艺传播给广大群众。
      近宇  十月十六日
