Xinhua News Agency, 10th: North China has achieved results in water conservancy construction. This year, the irrigated area has increased by three million mu, which can increase grain production by more than 300 million jin.

	In the production increase campaign this year, the broad masses of farmers in North China generally demanded to dig canals and wells to transform dry land into paddy fields in order to overcome the impact of the spring drought on agricultural production. As of the end of July, with the encouragement and loan support of the People's Government, the area increased by the development of channels accounted for two-thirds of the three million mu of farmland water conservancy projects completed in North China. Larger-scale projects include the Sanggan River, Yu River, and Hun River, the three major state-owned siltation canals in Chahar Province, which have completed the first phase of the project this year and can irrigate 470,000 mu of land. The completion of the Lifeng and other three major canals and the renovation of 24 small canals in Pingyuan Province can increase the province's paddy fields by more than 520,000 mu. In addition, the construction of small-scale well irrigation projects in various provinces has also surpassed previous years. For example, Hebei Province alone has completed the construction of more than 30,000 new and repaired old wells this year, and increased and repaired more than 40,000 waterwheels, which can irrigate more than 600,000 mu of land in total. The number of waterwheels and wells increased in Pingyuan and Shanxi provinces this year is also more than in previous years.

	This year, the provinces in North China have paid great attention to the management and maintenance of various channels and the resolution of water conservancy disputes. In addition to strengthening the leadership of the Water Conservancy Committee, most areas have mobilized farmers to carry out democratic management. For example, the Xinxiang Special Zone in Pingyuan Province held a water conservancy representative meeting to formulate irrigation plans and water usage covenants, and studied methods for assigning sections of each channel to be responsible for maintenance. Farmers in Lingqiu and other places in Hebei Province even operate water conservancy in a cooperative manner. For example, the Dongsheng Canal Water Conservancy Cooperative in Lingqiu County is formed by farmers from eleven villages in the county who pooled shares. This can not only achieve reasonable water use, but also effectively reduce water use disputes. In addition, in places where wells are dug and waterwheels are placed, farmers have generally organized mutual aid groups to solve difficulties in technology, labor, and funding. For example, there are 20,000 waterwheel mutual aid groups in Hebei Province. Some places in Pingyuan Province have also created the experience of signing well-digging mutual aid contracts, organizing farmers with skills and labor to help each other exchange work, and jointly purchase well-digging tools.

	The achievements in farmland water conservancy construction in North China this year are mainly due to the farmers' urgent demand for developing production and the strong support of the People's Government after the land reform. For example, under the wide publicity of the slogan "Digging a well is like a cornucopia" and the People's Government's production incentive policy of "transforming dry land into paddy fields without bearing burdens for three years," farmers in Hebei Province have automatically organized mutual aid groups to dig wells. In the first half of this year, the People's Bank of China issued agricultural water conservancy loans totaling more than 36 million jin of millet in five provinces and two cities in North China. At the same time, the People's Government organized more than 500 factories to manufacture 100,000 waterwheels by means of processing orders. The Hebei Provincial People's Government has also built more than 480 joint state-private brick kilns to supply the materials needed by farmers for digging wells.

### 华北各地水利建设有成绩  今年增加灌溉面积三百万亩，约可增产粮食三亿多斤。

　　华北各地水利建设有成绩
    今年增加灌溉面积三百万亩，约可增产粮食三亿多斤。
    【新华社十日讯】华北各地今年农田水利的建设共增加灌溉面积三百万亩，约可增产粮食三亿多斤。
    华北全区广大农民在今年的增产运动中，为了克服春旱对农业生产的影响，普遍要求开渠打井，变旱田为水田。截至七月底止，华北各地农民在人民政府的鼓励和贷款支持下，全区已完成的三百万亩的农田水利工程中，由渠道的开发而增加的面积即占三分之二。规模较大的工程有察哈尔省的桑乾河、御河、浑河等三大国营淤灌渠，今年已完成第一期工程，可灌田四十七万亩。平原省利丰等三大渠的完成与二十四条小渠的修整，可增加该省水田五十二万多亩。此外，各省小型的水井灌溉工程建设成绩也超过往年，如河北一省今年共完成打新井和修旧井三万多眼，增加与修理水车四万多辆，总共可浇地六十多万亩。平原、山西等省今年增加的水车、水井也比往年为多。
    华北各省今年十分注意各渠道的管理养护工作与水利纠纷的解决。各地除加强水利委员会的领导外，大部地区都发动了农民进行民主管理。如平原省新乡专区曾召开水利代表会，制订了灌溉计划与使水公约，并研究出各渠分段负责养护的办法。河北省灵邱等地农民更以合作方式经营水利，如灵邱县的东胜渠水利合作社，即由该县十一村农民集股组成。这样不仅能作到合理用水，而且有效地减少了用水纠纷。此外，在打井置水车的地方，农民又普遍组织了互助组解决技术、劳力及经费等困难。如河北省即有水车互助组两万个。平原省部分地方还创造了订立打井互助合同的经验，组织有技术的与有劳力的农民互助换工，伙买打井工具等。
    华北今年农田水利建设能有这样的成绩，主要是由于土地改革以后，农民迫切要求发展生产与人民政府的大力支持。如河北省农民在“打井好比聚宝盆”的口号和人民政府“旱地变水田，三年不负担”的奖励生产政策的广泛宣传下，即纷纷自动组织互助组打井。人民银行今年上半年在华北五省两市共发放农田水利贷款合小米三千六百多万斤。同时，人民政府又以加工订货等办法，组织了五百多家工厂，造水车达十万辆。河北省人民政府更兴建了公私合营的砖窑四百八十多座，以供应农民打井需用的材料。
