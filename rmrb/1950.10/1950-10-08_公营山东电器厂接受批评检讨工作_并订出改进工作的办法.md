Public Shandong Electric Factory Accepts Criticism and Reviews Work
And Sets Out Methods for Improving Work

Following the publication of a worker correspondent Wang Huihua's criticism of the public Shandong Electric Factory's Factory Management Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Management Committee) for being superficial in the People's Garden on September 21st, the factory convened an enlarged standing committee meeting of the Management Committee on September 23rd to discuss the criticism from this newspaper. All members attending the meeting agreed that the newspaper's criticism was correct.

At the meeting, everyone reviewed their past work: In the past, the factory's Management Committee would decide on many things in one meeting, but few things were actually resolved. There was no preparation before the meeting, and no central focus during the meeting. Many trivial matters were brought up for discussion, while major production plans and cost accounting issues have not been resolved to this day. The decisions of the meetings were simply notified administratively from top to bottom, and leaders did not check on the implementation, so they could not be carried out, leading to continuous waste incidents in the factory. Wage issues and employee welfare issues could not be resolved, which seriously affected the production enthusiasm of employees. The number of worker representatives on the Management Committee was too small, which led to the formation of a "cadre meeting." For example, at the second Management Committee meeting, out of the twenty members attending the meeting, only seven were workers, and the rest were cadres.

The meeting examined the reasons for the above situation: First, cadres have a poor understanding of democratic factory management, and their thinking lacks a clear understanding of the importance of "relying on workers to run the factory well." Seeing that other factories had management committees, they also established a management committee, but in reality, their understanding of the nature and tasks of the management committee was very vague. Second, cadres had inconsistent ideas, and when they encountered specific problems that could not be solved, they could not carry out criticism and self-criticism to seek solutions. For example, when the trade union chairman Ma Yuming encountered obstacles in resolving the wage issue for apprentices in the battery department, he became uneasy about his work and made excuses that trade union work was everyone's business and was not actively involved in trade union work. Therefore, many workers had a lot of opinions about the trade union, and some employees even refused to accept their membership cards and did not pay membership fees. Third, the decisions of the Management Committee did not meet practical requirements and were couched in grandiose terms, but in fact, they could not solve the problem. For example, the Management Committee drafted a "Provisional Measures for Rationalization Proposals and Bonus for Exceeding Quotas" that was more than 3,500 words long, but it was not actually implemented; and many important production issues, such as quota management, have not been resolved. Fourth, the leadership lacked a production perspective and did not organize the strength of all levels of organizations, all employees, and technical personnel into production work. For example, engineer He Cai, who rarely expressed his opinions at the meeting, pointed out: "Our factory is not another agency, but a production organization, and all work should revolve around production." The Party branch and the trade union have also not done a good job in work that revolves around production and ensures the completion of production tasks. The Party, government, and trade union each do their own thing, and their steps are not consistent.

In order to improve future work, the meeting made the following resolutions: First, improve the meeting system, and solve problems at meetings. The central issues should be notified to the members in advance before the meeting, and opinions should be considered and widely solicited from the masses to overcome formalism in meetings. Second, establish the concept of relying on the working masses to run the enterprise well, promote democracy, give full play to the enthusiasm of all employees in the factory, and concentrate the wisdom of all employees on production. Third, go deep into the workshops, focus on production work, and promptly summarize experiences to promote comprehensiveness. Fourth, mobilize the vast number of employees to supervise production and listen to the criticisms of employees in a timely manner. Fifth, ensure that a workers' representative conference and a management committee meeting are held once a month. And a workers' representative conference will be convened soon to focus on resolving three issues: rationalization proposals, reward and punishment regulations, and attendance systems.

Finally, the Standing Committee unanimously decided to combine rectification and study to effectively solve the above problems and improve work.

　　公营山东电器厂接受批评检讨工作
    并订出改进工作的办法
    九月二十一日人民园地发表了工人通讯员王辉华对公营山东电器厂工厂管理委员会（以下简称管委会）流于形式的批评后，该厂在九月二十三日召开了管委会扩大常委会，对本报的批评进行了讨论。出席会议的各委员一致认为本报的批评是正确的。
    会上，大家检讨了过去的工作：该厂管委会过去开一次会议，决定的事情很多，但解决的事情却很少。会前没有准备，开会没有中心。许多琐屑小事都拿到会上讨论，而生产大计，成本核算等问题却迄今没有搞出结果。会议的决议只由行政上下一道通知，领导者不去检查执行情况，因而不能贯彻，以致该厂浪费事故连续发生，工资问题，职工福利问题，都得不到解决，严重地影响了职工的生产情绪。管委会工人委员席数太少，因而形成了“干部会”。如第二次管委会参加会议的二十名委员，工人只有七名，其余都是干部。
    会议检查了发生以上情况的原因：一、干部对工厂管理民主化学习差，思想上没有明确认识“依靠工人搞好工厂”的重要性。看到人家厂子有管委会，也就成立了管委会，但实际上对管委会的性质与任务的认识是很模糊的。二、干部思想不一致，碰到具体问题解决不了的时候，又不能开展批评和自我批评，求得解决。如工会主席马玉鸣在解决电池部学员工资问题时，碰了钉子，就不安心工作，借口工会是大家的事情，对工会工作不积极干了。因此许多工人对工会很有意见，个别职工连会员证也不要了，会费也不交了。三、管委会决议不合实际要求，措词堂皇，事实上不能解决问题。如管委会搞了一个长达三千五百余字的“合理化建议与超额奖励暂行办法草案”，实际上并未执行；而生产上的许多重要问题，如定额管理等，都没有得到解决。四、领导上缺乏生产观点，没有把各级组织，全体职工和技术人员的力量组织到生产工作上来。如会议上素来不大发表意见的工程师何才就提出：“我们工厂不是别的机关，而是生产机构，一切工作应该围绕生产。”支部与工会对围绕生产、保证完成生产任务的工作也没有做好。党、政、工各搞各的一套，步调不一致。
    为了改进今后工作，会议作出如下决议：一、改善会议制度，开会要解决问题。会前应把中心问题先通知委员，事前进行酝酿考虑，广泛征询群众意见，以克服会议的形式主义。二、树立依靠工人群众搞好企业的观念，发扬民主，发挥全厂职工的积极性，把全体职工的智慧集中在生产中。三、深入车间，有重点地搞生产工作，并及时总结经验，推动全面。四、发动广大职工监督生产，及时听取职工的批评。五、保证每月召开一次工代会议及管委会会议。并在最近即召开工代会议，有重点地解决合理化建议、奖惩条例、考勤制度等三个问题。
    最后，常委会并一致决定要结合整风学习，切实解决以上问题，改进工作。
