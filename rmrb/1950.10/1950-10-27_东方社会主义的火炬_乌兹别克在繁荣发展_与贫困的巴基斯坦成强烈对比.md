　　The Torch of Eastern Socialism
    Uzbekistan's Flourishing Development in Stark Contrast to Impoverished Pakistan
    "Pravda" Publishes Article by Aybek
    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch from Moscow, 14th] TASS, Moscow, 14th: Soviet Uzbek writer and Stalin Prize laureate, Aybek, wrote in today's "Pravda" that socialism has changed the face of Uzbekistan. As a result of the wise Lenin-Stalin nationality policy, this country, once poor, backward and ravaged by a handful of landlords and capitalists, has become a prosperous republic, which the Soviet people proudly call "the torch of Eastern Socialism."

    I recently traveled through the barren steppe region, which for thousands of years had been cloaked in the gloomy garb of thorny plants. Now the flowing water has completely changed the face of these barren steppes. Joyful songs rise in the vast and emerald-green fields. While Uzbek collective farmers are taking more and more arable land from the steppes with incredible resistance and perseverance, and covering the land with blooming cotton, orchards and gardens, many new villages surrounded by lush trees make visitors linger and forget to return. The land generously rewards their sincere and selfless labor. Like all the peoples of the Soviet Union, the Uzbek people have come far ahead of the peoples of India, Iran, Turkey and the Arab countries.

    I visited Pakistan. In this country, still ruled by British imperialism, the degree of mass poverty is unbelievable. The poverty of Pakistani peasants, the suffering and misfortune of workers are beyond description. Pakistani tenant farmers, living in shacks and huts, are forced to give 70 percent of the harvest they cultivate under the scorching sun and under conditions of virtual slavery to rapacious landlords. Workers and their families are crammed into squalid shacks that do not meet the most basic requirements of human habitation. In the dormitory of the parachute factory in Lahore, two hundred and fifty people live in a soot-blackened, dirty room without windows or floors, separated by tattered bedsheets, including women, children, good people, and the sick. Seeing the suffering of these thin and haggard people, driven into terrible poverty by the capitalists, it is impossible not to shed tears.

    Aybek continued: The British "civilizers" have used a thick wall to isolate the Pakistani people, who once enriched world culture with many outstanding achievements, from schools and education. Illiteracy has reached an extremely high rate in Pakistan. In a village outside Karachi, we were told that only two boys attended the church primary school. I personally witnessed the Pakistani masses vehemently protesting against the war and denouncing those who attempt to profit at the cost of the people's blood and tears. In numerous grand gatherings in Lahore and Karachi, the working people indignantly exposed the instigators of a new war—the US imperialism that is carrying out a brutal and sinful war in Korea. At the same time, the working people of Pakistan expressed their love and gratitude to the Soviet Union—the staunch fortress of peace, freedom and justice. The Soviet Union, led by Stalin, the great friend of progressive mankind, will not betray the trust and hope of the people of the world.

    The Soviet people have demonstrated their solidarity in the struggle for peace and progress, and have demonstrated their unwavering confidence that the forces of peace will eventually prevail over the forces of evil. Peace will prevail over war!

### 东方社会主义的火炬  乌兹别克在繁荣发展  与贫困的巴基斯坦成强烈对比

　　东方社会主义的火炬
    乌兹别克在繁荣发展
    与贫困的巴基斯坦成强烈对比
    真理报发表阿伊贝克专文
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十四日电：苏联乌兹贝克作家，斯大林奖金得奖人阿伊贝克，今日在真理报上撰文称：社会主义已经改变了乌兹贝克的面貌。由于英明的列宁——斯大林民族政策的结果，这一个曾经是贫困落后而且曾被一小撮地主资本家所摧残的国家已经变成了一个繁荣的共和国，苏联人民骄傲地称它为“东方社会主义的火炬”。
    我最近曾游历过贫瘠的草原区。数千年来，它都披着多刺植物的阴郁的外衣。现在流水已经完全改变了这些贫瘠草原区的面貌。广阔而碧绿的田野里扬起了欢乐的歌声。当乌兹贝克集体农民正在以难以置信的反抗和坚毅的精神，从草原上取得愈来愈多的耕地，并且在土地上铺满了盛开的棉花、果园和花园的时候，许多新的四周环绕着嘉树茂林的村庄使游人们乐而忘返。土地慷慨地报偿了他们诚挚的忘我的劳动。象苏联各族人民一样，乌兹贝克人民已经远远地走在印度、伊朗、土耳其和各阿拉伯国家人民的前面。
    我曾访问过巴基斯坦。在这个英帝国主义依然统治着的国家里，群众贫困的程度是难以相信的。巴基斯坦农民的贫困、工人的苦痛和不幸是笔墨所无法形容的。住在茅棚和草舍中的巴基斯坦佃农们被迫把他们在炎炎烈日之下，在实际上是奴役条件之下种植出来的收获物的百分之七十送给强取豪夺的地主。工人及其家庭拥塞在一些卑陋的茅屋里，这些茅屋不能满足人类居住的最基本的要求。在拉合尔降落伞工厂的工人宿舍里，有二百五十个人居住在一个煤烟黝黑、肮脏而且没有窗户地板的屋子里，中间以破烂的被单隔开所有的人，包括妇女、小孩、好人、病人。看到这些被资本家逼入可怕的贫困，瘦弱而憔悴的人的苦痛是不可能不落泪的。
    阿伊贝克继称：英国的“开化者们”用一道厚墙使这些曾经以许多卓越的成就丰富了世界文化的巴基斯坦人民，与学校和教育绝缘。文盲在巴基斯坦达到了极高的比率。在喀喇蚩城外的一个村庄里，人们告诉我们，那里只有两个男孩子上教会小学。我亲眼看见巴基斯坦人民群众猛烈抗议战争，痛斥那些企图以人民的血泪为代价来牟利的人。拉合尔和喀喇蚩的劳动人民在许多盛大的集会上愤慨地揭露新战争的挑拨者——正在朝鲜进行残暴而罪恶的战争的美帝国主义。同时，巴基斯坦的劳动人民表示他们对苏联——和平、自由与正义的坚强堡垒——的热爱与感激。进步人类的伟大友人斯大林所领导的苏联，将不负全世界人民的信赖和希望。
    苏联人民在争取和平与进步的斗争中证明了他们的团结一致，证明了他们对和平力量终将战胜罪恶势力的不可动摇的信心。和平必将战胜战争！
