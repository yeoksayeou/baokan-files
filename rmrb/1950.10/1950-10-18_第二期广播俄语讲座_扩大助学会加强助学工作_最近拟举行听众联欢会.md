　　Second Term of Broadcast Russian Lectures
    Expanding the Assistance Society to Strengthen Tutoring Work
    Listener Get-Together Planned Recently
    The second term of broadcast Russian lectures, jointly organized by the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Beijing People's Radio Station, began broadcasting on October 9th. As of now, approximately four thousand people have registered to listen, of which three-quarters are automatically organized study groups participating in collective learning. In order to promptly solve various problems encountered by listeners in their studies, the lecture series has expanded the organization of the Assistance Society. In addition to some students from the Russian language group of the Teachers' College continuing to provide assistance, some students from the Russian language groups of Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Yenching University are also participating in the tutoring work. Currently, statistics and some necessary preparations are underway, and tutoring will begin soon based on the needs of each collective learning group.
    In order to establish contact with listeners of the Russian lectures, the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Beijing People's Radio Station recently plan to hold the first listener get-together of the second term. The time, location, and ticket collection procedures will be announced by the radio.
    The second term of broadcast teaching materials is divided into two volumes, elementary and intermediate. To facilitate listeners and readers in purchasing, they have been sold by Beijing Xinhua Bookstore, Sanlian Bookstore, Lianying Bookstore, Dazhong Bookstore, and Xuexi Bookstore since October 12th. Listeners who have not purchased the teaching materials can go to the above bookstores to buy them. If other provinces and cities wish to purchase, they can directly send the price (elementary priced at 7,000 yuan, intermediate priced at 1,500 yuan) and postage to the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association at No. 2 Yuhe Bridge, Dongjiaominxiang, Beijing, and the teaching materials will be sent.

    最近拟举行听众联欢会
    北京市中苏友好协会与北京市人民电台合办的广播俄语讲座第二期已于十月九日起开始播讲。此次登记听讲的人数，到目前为止约有四千人左右，其中四分之三系自动组织学习小组参加集体学习的。为了及时给听众解决学习中的各种问题，该讲座特扩大了助学会的组织，除原有师大俄语组一部分同学继续助学外，并有北京大学、清华大学、燕京大学俄语组一部分同学亦参加助学工作。目前正进行统计及一些必要的准备工作，不久即可根据各集体学习组的要求开始助学。
    北京市中苏友协与京市人民电台为了与收听俄语讲座的听众取得一定的联系，最近拟举行第二期第一次听众联欢会，时间、地点及领票手续等由广播发出通知。
    第二期广播教材共分初级、中级两册，为照顾听众及读者购买便利起见，自十月十二日起由京市新华书店、三联书店、联营书店、大众书店、学习书店代售。没有买到教材的听众，可到上列各书店购买。其他各省市如有购买者，可直接将价款（初级定价七千元、中级定价一千五百元）及邮资寄交北京市东交民巷御河桥二号北京市中苏友好协会宣传部，即可将教材寄上。
