　　For a Healthy Second Generation
　　He Xiangning
　　In old China, under the rule of imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, children from a young age were plunged into the terrible abyss of poverty, lack of education, and inhuman exploitation. The shocking infant mortality rate in China was a rare fact in the world, and even those children who managed to grow up were not necessarily physically strong. The basic reason for this, of course, was the reactionary rule of imperialism, but on the other hand, it was also due to carelessness in the care of children after birth; inadequate sanitation facilities during childbirth; and unskilled midwifery techniques. At the same time, mothers did not take care of their own health conditions before and after childbirth, thus causing such a significant loss. In order to remedy these problems, in addition to the government's efforts to improve the overall progress of women and protect them in cultural and economic aspects, assistance to mothers during childbirth is very important and urgent, and this has been noted throughout the country. Mothers must give birth in maternity hospitals with suitable sanitary equipment, and midwives with sufficient medical knowledge must replace ignorant and elderly traditional birth attendants, and make every effort to avoid puerperal fever in mothers and tetanus in infants caused by incomplete disinfection. Other special care for mothers is also very important. Mothers must always pay attention to exercising their bodies and improving their health. From the first few months of pregnancy, they should go to women's clinics for examination. Pregnant women need appropriate labor systems, rest and diet. This is not only for themselves, but also for the future children, so that they have the necessary and rich vitality at the beginning of life!
　　Every mother should have the opportunity to receive general knowledge about infant care, because slight negligence in breastfeeding and care can lead to the death of a small life. Local health agencies should expand guidance to mothers and children on effective prevention of common infectious diseases in children such as whooping cough, scarlet fever, sepsis neonatorum, typhus, and acute pneumonia, because to do a good job in child health protection, it must be the result of tireless work by all family women and all maternal and child health workers!
　　Every mother has the right to demand that her children be able to defend against hunger and disease, and grow up in a happy and peaceful environment. In order to prevent the invasion of diseases, we have widely established clinics, hospitals, obstetrical hospitals, and nurseries in various cities and villages. We regularly take care of the health of the children. However, in case the children suffer accidental injuries, such as knife wounds, burns, stray bullet wounds, poisoning, etc., ordinary women often become at a loss because they have not received systematic training in first aid and bandaging techniques. As the conspiracy of American imperialists to expand the war is becoming more and more intense, and they have frantically bombed and strafed our northeastern border several times, massacring our peaceful residents, in order to take into account the safety of the country's most precious second generation: let us stand up with the full dignity of women and mothers, and make serious accusations against those executioners who kill "the buds of mankind"! Moreover, we call on women sisters across the country to learn first aid knowledge as soon as possible, master the techniques of bandaging and wound dressing, and prepare to calmly carry out emergency treatment before receiving doctor's treatment in case of an accident. Because at present, the conditions of doctors and medicines in various towns and villages in China are often not fully available, and it often takes a lot of time to transport patients to the hospital. In order to prevent the aggravation of the patient's condition, it is necessary to take appropriate first aid measures. At the same time, minor injuries and illnesses can also be treated simply and easily due to proper first aid. In fact, knowledge of first aid, fire prevention, and general poison prevention is not only very important in wartime, but also in peacetime, a family woman should also have this knowledge in case of emergency when the north wind is whistling and the weather is dry, so that the children in the family can live more safely!
　　I hope that in the future, general women's movement workers can open more first aid training courses to specifically teach first aid methods; (according to my previous experience in Shanghai during the January 28th Incident and the early stage of the July 7th Anti-Japanese War, it can be completed in about four months.) At the same time, I hope that female compatriots across the country will seize the opportunity to respond to the call to learn trauma first aid techniques anytime and anywhere. All for the country's second generation!
　　Every mother has the right to demand that her children can live, be happy, healthy and strong in a warm and well-fed environment; however, ordinary children in our country have long lived in disaster in the past, and malnutrition and chronic diseases have damaged their minds and bodies. The adverse social environment at that time deprived children of their due happiness, which was partly the reason, but also greatly influenced by the fact that women, under the remnants of feudal bondage, had some not very correct views on going to the fields to participate in actual production work, so that they failed to win reasonable maintenance for their children. In fact, participating in production is not only necessary for building a new democratic China, but also completely consistent with the demands of women's liberation, because women must have an independent economic status in order to be liberated. Therefore, whether it is to regularly seek reasonable maintenance for children to be well-fed and warm, or for women to break away from men and be completely independent, I think women should participate in production. At the same time, the construction work of New China also needs a lot of manpower and material resources. If women, who account for half of the country's population, actively participate in production, what a powerful help this will be!
　　Currently, I am in charge of the work of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and I am very concerned about the lives of overseas Chinese and their relatives in Fujian, Guangdong, Yunnan, Guangxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other provinces. As far as I know, in the past, most of the overseas Chinese relatives relied on remittances from Nanyang or the Americas to make a living. During the Anti-Japanese War, remittances were interrupted, and many overseas Chinese relatives were in great difficulty. Children not only could not go to school, but also had no means of living. Only by participating in production work can their lives be guaranteed. Among the general sideline productions, I think that sugarcane cultivation and sugar making, and cotton planting and spinning are suitable for women's physical conditions. Overseas Chinese women should actively participate in these. In southern China, Fujian and Guangdong provinces, and parts of Yunnan Province, sugarcane and cotton are very suitable for planting. Especially the sugar industry, in various parts of southern China, can have great development in the future. For example, the Javanese sugar merchant Huang Zhonghan had more than 20 million dollars (one dollar is equivalent to two Hong Kong dollars) of assets more than 20 years ago, not including what was extracted by the Dutch Indian government in the middle. The sugar industry can enrich the country and the family in this way. If overseas Chinese women in various places can actively participate in production, in three to five years, the continuous sugarcane forests and cotton fields will be the guarantee of their children's future happiness!

　　为了健康的第二代
    何香凝
    过去帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石反动派统治下的旧中国儿童，自少就陷入贫困、失学、与非人地被剥削的可怕深渊之中。中国婴儿死亡率之惊人，是世界少见的事实，就是能够长大一点的儿童，体格亦不见得强壮。这基本原因，固然是帝国主义反动统治所造成，但另一方面，也当然是在小孩出生之后的保养不小心；生产时的卫生设备不完妥；和接生技术不高明所致。同时在产前产后，做母亲的也没有照顾到自身应有的卫生条件，于是造成了这样的一个重大损失。为了挽救这些，除政府在文化、经济各方面，提高妇女、保障妇女的普遍进步外，对母亲们的分娩时的援助，是非常重要而迫切的，这在全国各地都注意及了。母亲必得在有适宜的卫生设备下的助产院生产，由有充分医学常识的助产士来代替了愚昧年老的接生婆，尽力避免因消毒不彻底而引起母亲的产褥热和婴儿的破伤风。其他对母亲特有的关顾，也很重要，做母亲的，固然要经常注意锻炼体魄，增进健康，自怀孕的最初几个月起，就应去妇女诊疗机关检查，孕妇需要有适当的劳动制度，休息和饮食，这不单是为了她自己，同时也为了未来的孩子，好使他们在生命的开始，就具有必需的、丰富的生命活力！
    每个母亲，都应有机会去接受普遍的育婴常识，因为在婴儿哺乳和照顾方面，稍有疏忽，都足以致小生命于死亡，诸如百日咳、猩红热、四六风、斑疹伤寒、急性肺炎等等儿童常有的传染病，地方上的卫生机构都应扩大指导母亲及儿童们作有效的预防，因为要儿童健康保护工作搞得好，就一定是全体家庭妇女及所有妇婴保健工作人员不倦地努力工作的结果！
    每个母亲，都有权利为孩子们要求能够防御饥馑疾病，同时可以在幸福和平的环境下成长起来，为了防止病魔的侵扰，我们已经在各城市乡村广泛的设立了诊疗所、医院、产科医院、托儿所。经常料理孩子们的健康。但是万一孩子们受到意外的伤害，诸如刀伤、火伤、流弹伤、中毒等等，一般的妇女，就常会因没有有系统地受过救急，裹扎的技术训练，一时手足无措起来。在美帝国主义者扩大战争的阴谋正日益炽涨，数度疯狂轰炸扫射我国东北边境，屠杀我和平居民的今日，为了顾虑到国家最珍贵的第二代安全：让我们用女性、母性的全副尊严站立起来，对那些虐杀“人类的蓓蕾”的刽子手，提出严重控诉！并且，号召全国妇女姊妹们从速学好救急知识，掌握了包扎、裹伤的技术，准备在万一发生事故之时，在未受医师治疗之前，可以镇静地先行紧急处置。因为目前中国各乡镇之中，医师药物等条件，常常未能充分具备，要将患者运到医院，在在需要很多时间，为了防止患者病势加剧，非处以适当的救急不可。同时轻微的伤病，也可以因救急得宜，简易地治疗。其实救急、消防、和普通防毒等常识，不但在战时，十分重要，就是在平时，一个家庭妇女，在北风凛冽，天气干燥的时候，为了以防万一，亦应具备这些常识，好使家庭内的小孩子，可以生活得更为安全！
    我希望今后一般的妇运工作者，能多多开办救伤救急讲习所，专门讲授救急方法；（据我以前在一二八事变及七七抗战初期，在上海举办的经验，约四个月时间，就可以速成。）同时希望全国女同胞们，随时随地把握机会响应学习创伤救急技术的号召。一切为了国家的第二代！
    每个母亲，都有权利要求她们的孩子，能幸福的在温饱的环境下生存、愉快、康强；但是，我国一般的儿童，在过去却长期生活在灾难之中，营养不良与慢性疾病，使他们精神身体，都受到损害。当时社会环境恶劣，剥夺了儿童应有的幸福，固然是部分原因，但是由于妇女们在封建束缚的遗毒下，对下地参加实际生产工作，有些不十分对的看法，以致未能为她们的孩子，争取得合理的保养，也有很大影响，其实下地参加生产，不仅为建设新民主主义的新中国所必需，而且与妇女解放的要求，完全相一致，因为妇女要得解放，首先要有独立的经济地位，所以不论是为了经常地求得孩子们既饱又暖的合理保养，或是为了妇女们要脱离男子完全独立，我以为妇女都应该参加生产。同时新中国的建设工作上，也在在需要大量的人力物力，要是有了占国内人口一半的妇女来积极参加生产，这将是何等有力的帮助！
    目前我负责了侨务委员会的工作，对闽、粤、云、桂、鲁、苏、浙等各省的侨胞侨眷的生活，十分关怀。据我所知，过去一般的侨眷，多数是靠南洋或美洲的侨汇度日，抗战期间，侨汇不通，许多侨眷，困苦非常，儿童们不但无法升学，而且生活无着，只有参加生产工作，生活才有保障。在一般副业生产之中，我以为适合妇女体力条件的，要算种蔗制糖，植棉纺纱两种，侨眷妇女，尤应积极参加，在华南闽、粤两省，及云南省之一部分，种蔗种棉都很适宜，尤其是制糖业，在华南各地，将来都可以有很大发展，例如爪哇糖商黄仲涵，就在二十多年前，已有二千余万叨币（按叨币一元即港币二元）以上的资财，其他被荷印政府居间抽剥去了的，尚未计算在内，糖业之能富国兴家，有如是者，假如各地侨眷妇女，都能积极参加生产，三五年后，连绵的蔗林与棉畦，就是孩子们将来幸福的保证了！
