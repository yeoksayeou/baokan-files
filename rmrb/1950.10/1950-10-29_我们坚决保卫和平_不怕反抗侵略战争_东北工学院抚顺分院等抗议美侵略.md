　　We Firmly Defend Peace and Fear No War of Resistance Against Aggression
    Northeast Institute of Technology Fushun Branch and Others Protest U.S. Aggression
    [By Our Newspaper] The entire faculty, staff, and students of the Northeast Institute of Technology Fushun Branch and the Fushun Mining Advanced Vocational School issued written statements saying:
    Since American imperialism openly invaded Taiwan and Korea, it has continued to violate our country's airspace, bombing and strafing our peaceful residents, shelling and illegally searching our merchant ships, attempting to spread the flames of war onto the heads of the Chinese people. This series of undeniable facts fully exposes the conspiracy of American imperialism to expand its war of aggression, seriously threatening the safety of the Chinese people. We resolutely oppose wars of aggression. We must expose the crimes of American imperialism among the broad masses, raise vigilance, diligently study and improve teaching methods, intensify the study of technology, and raise our political level, using practical actions to support the statement of the Foreign Ministry spokesperson. To defend our peaceful construction, happy lives, and pleasant studies, we will not hesitate to dedicate all our strength. We solemnly tell the aggressors that we love peace and resolutely oppose wars of aggression, but when the flames of war burn on our heads, we will never fear resisting wars of aggression!
    Over three thousand faculty, students, and staff of various departments of Northeast Normal University in Changchun recently held anti-U.S. aggression rallies, group meetings, and lecture meetings, and issued protest letters one after another. The protest letter from the entire student body of the first class of the Mathematics Specialization Program of the Natural Sciences College of the university stated: "If American imperialism dares to continue to expand its war of aggression and threaten our country's peaceful construction, we will contribute everything we have to eliminate the aggressors in order to defend our motherland, defend world peace, and defend the beautiful future of youth."
    Dong Shulin, a student from the College of Science of Shanxi University, expressed his opinion, hoping that young people across the country who are studying science will intensify their studies and master modern science and technology to fight for defending the motherland and defending world peace.

    【本报讯】东北工学院抚顺分院和抚顺矿山高级职业学校全体教职员工学生，发表书面意见称：
    美帝公开侵略台湾朝鲜以来，继续不断地侵犯我国领空，轰炸扫射我国和平居民，炮击并非法盘查我国商船，企图把战争的火焰，延烧在中国人民的头上。这一连串无可狡辩的事实，充分暴露了美帝扩大侵略战争的阴谋，严重地威胁着中国人民的安全。我们坚决反对侵略战争，我们要在广大群众中揭露美帝罪行，提高警惕，努力钻研、改进教学方法，加紧学习技术，提高政治水平，用实际行动来支持外交部发言人的声明。为保卫我们和平的建设、幸福的生活、愉快的学习，不惜献出一切力量。我们并郑重地告诉侵略者们，我们爱好和平，坚决反对侵略战争，但是战争的火焰烧到我们的头上时，我们决不惧怕反抗侵略战争！
    长春东北师范大学各院系师生职工三千余人，最近曾举行了反美侵略大会、小组会和讲演会，并纷纷发表抗议书。该校自然科学院数学专修科第一班全体学生的抗议书中说：“如果美帝胆敢继续扩大侵略战争，威胁我国的和平建设，我们为了保卫祖国、保卫世界和平和青年美好的将来，决贡献出我们的一切，来消灭侵略者。”
    山西大学理学院学生董树林发表意见，希望全国学习科学的青年们，加紧学习，掌握现代科学技术，为保卫祖国、保卫世界和平而奋斗。
