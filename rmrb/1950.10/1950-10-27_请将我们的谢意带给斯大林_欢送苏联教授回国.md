　　Please Convey Our Gratitude to Stalin
    ——Farewell to Returning Soviet Professors——
    Zhao Guoguang, Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions Cadre School
    The Soviet Union is the hope of mankind, Lenin and Stalin are our suns. You are good sons of the Bolshevik Party. When our People's Republic of China was newly founded, and our trade union work was developing on a large scale, you came, braving the bitter cold and snow! And then you came again in that hot summer – coming to our school, enthusiastically spreading the advanced experiences of your country's construction.
    During the days of living with you, you worked hard day and night, patiently and meticulously educating and helping us. You told us the methods of work and imparted to us the experience of practical work. Making each of us more and more energetic in the learning process!
    You are the model of internationalists for us. Now, dear teachers, you are about to leave us, and we will also be like children leaving their mothers. Dear teachers, please bring our sincere gratitude to the great Soviet people, and to our most respected revolutionary teacher – Stalin!
                  Written in October 1950 at Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions Cadre School

　　请将我们的谢意带给斯大林
    ——欢送苏联教授回国——
    天津全总干部学校  赵国光
    苏联是人类的希望，列宁、斯大林是我们的太阳。您们是布尔塞维克党的好儿子。当我们中华人民共和国成立不久，我们工会工作大规模开展的时候，您们就冒着严寒的风雪来了，又去了！又在那炎热的夏天来了——来到我们的学校，热心地传播着您们国家建设的先进经验。
    在和您们共同生活的日子里，您们昼夜辛辛苦苦地工作，细心、耐心地教育和帮助我们。你们告诉了我们工作的方法，传授给我们以实际工作的经验。使我们在学习过程中，一个一个都越学越有劲了！
    您们是我们国际主义者的榜样。现在，亲爱的老师，您们就要离开我们了，我们也将像孩子一样离开自己的妈妈。亲爱的老师，请把我们真诚的谢意，带给伟大的苏联人民，带给我们最敬爱的革命导师——斯大林！
                  一九五○年十月作于天津全总干部学校
