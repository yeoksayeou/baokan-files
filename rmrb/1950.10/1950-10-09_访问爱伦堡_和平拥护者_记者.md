Visiting Ehrenburg
“Peace Advocate” Reporter

　　Question: Some people refused to sign the Stockholm Appeal, their excuse being that absolutely prohibiting atomic bombs without restricting other kinds of weapons seems only to benefit the Soviet Union. Do you think that the resolution passed in Prague—expanding the action program of peace advocates due to the achievements of the Stockholm Appeal signature campaign, namely opposing all kinds of war preparations—can change these people's original opinions?

　　Answer: Those who hypocritically say such things are attempting to wage a struggle against peace. They will not change their opinions, because their "opinions" are not beliefs but business.

　　For example, Mr. Acheson once said that the Stockholm Appeal was against atomic bombs and not against aggression, but just as he said these words, he took an action that can only be called aggression. He rudely interfered in the internal affairs of another nation, a nation that, though it doesn't have forty-eight states like the United States, also has the right to live according to its own will.

　　However, I believe that those who have been misled by the distorted interpretations of the Stockholm Appeal by newspapers and politicians—a large number—will now thoroughly understand the true meaning of this movement we are conducting.

　　Anyone who understands these kinds of issues can easily understand that in this dispute—the dispute between supporting bombs and opposing bombs—it is not about choosing between the Soviet Union and the United States, but about choosing between people and bombs.

　　The movement to defend peace is not limited to, and has never been limited to, the demand for the prohibition of atomic bombs. We have always said that the unconditional prohibition of atomic bombs is only the first step in establishing lasting peace. We have always said that this prohibition, on the one hand, protects people from the most terrible weapons, and on the other hand, eases the atmosphere to create the possibility for negotiations.

　　Now, we demand the limitation of all kinds of weapons. We oppose atomic bombs, and also ordinary bombs, tanks, and bullets. Furthermore, at our previous conferences, we consistently advocated that whoever conducts war propaganda, whoever promotes psychological and spiritual mass slaughter of humanity, must be fought against. The criminals who are conducting propaganda for hydrogen bombs, plague fleas, and "preventive war" should not imagine that their names will be forgotten. Even the tallest skyscraper in the United States cannot hold the list of people who signed the Stockholm Appeal; but only a few sheets of paper are needed to write down the names of the war peddlers, because their number is too small. This is not an international directory of celebrities. This will be a list of defendants, who will appear before the people's court on a beautiful day.

　　The propaganda for a new war must be stopped. Conditions must be created for negotiations for lasting peace. The people of all countries should demand that their governments and the United Nations replace the Cold War with a period of genuine peace negotiations.

    问：有些人拒绝了在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，他们的借口是：绝对禁止原子弹而不限制他种武器好像只不过有利于苏联。你看，在布拉格所通过的决议——因征集斯德哥尔摩宣言签名运动的成就而扩大和平拥护者的行动纲领，即反对战争的各种准备——是否可以改变这些人原来的意见呢？
    答：那些虚伪地说着这种话的人企图进行反对和平的斗争。他们不会改变自己的意见，因为他们的“意见”不是信仰而是生意经。
    例如艾奇逊先生曾经斯德哥尔摩宣言是反对原子弹，而不反对侵略，但是正当他说这句话的时候，他却采取了一种非称为侵略不可的行动。他粗野地干涉了别个民族的内部事务，这民族虽没有像美国似的拥有四十八州，可也同样有依照自己的意愿生活的权利。
    但是，我以为：那些被报纸和政客们对于斯德哥尔摩宣言的歪曲解释弄迷惑了的人们——为数很多——现在会透彻了解我们所进行的这一运动的真正意义的。
    凡是理解这类问题的人们不难了解：在这个争论中—拥护炸弹和反对炸弹的争论中——并不关涉到苏联与美国两国之间的选择，而是关涉到人与炸弹之间的选择。
    保卫和平的运动不只限制于、任何时候从未限制于禁止原子弹的要求。我们一向这样说，无条件禁止原子弹只是建立持久和平的第一步。我们老是说，这种禁止，一方面是保卫人民免于最恐怖的武器，另一方面是缓和空气，以造成进行谈判的可能性。
    现在，我们要求限制各种武器，我们反对原子弹，也反对普通炸弹、坦克和子弹。进而，在我们的历次会议上，我们一贯主张，谁进行战争的宣传，谁促进心理上和精神上的大规模屠杀人类，那么就必须与谁斗争。进行着氢气弹、鼠疫蚤和“预防性战争”宣传的罪犯们不要妄想他们的名字会被忘记的。对于在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名的人名册，甚至连美国最高的摩天楼也装不下；但是要把战争贩子的名字写下来，却只需要几张纸，因为他们的数目太少了。这不是国际名人册。这将是被告的名单，这些人将在美丽的一天，出现在人民法庭之前。
    必须停止新战争的宣传。必须为进行持久和平的谈判而创造条件。各国人民应当要求自己的政府和联合国，以真正和平谈判时期来代替冷战时期。
