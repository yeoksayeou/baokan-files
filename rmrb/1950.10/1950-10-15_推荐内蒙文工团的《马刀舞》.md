　　Among the many dance performances celebrating National Day in the capital, "Saber Dance" is one of the programs that impressed the masses favorably.

　　This dance fully expresses the heroic, brave, lively and enthusiastic spirit of the People's Liberation Army, and its content is combined with military training competitions.

　　Comrade Jia Zuoguang combined the spirit of Soviet dance with the lives of the soldiers in this creation, which is a very good mass dance.

　　Every movement in "Saber Dance" is extracted from the lives of the soldiers. This is the soldiers' own dance. It embodies the new patriotism and great selfless and noble qualities of today's soldiers.

　　The theme of "Saber Dance" is very clear and suitable for the soldiers' recreational activities. It is also very suitable as a spiritual education for combat. At the same time, it can cultivate the soldiers' healthy and brave spirit in dance learning.

　　The form of "Saber Dance" is not extravagant in the army. As long as you make a fake iron shell knife, you can solve the material conditions for the performance. Compared with Yangge dance and waist drum, it is more suitable for the actions and postures in the soldiers' lives.

　　"Saber Dance" is very neat and powerful. There is no unhealthy element in the performance in the army. It meets the requirements of the soldiers. It is also loved by the workers and peasants. In exploring how to engage in soldier dance or military dance, it is a good demonstration for us. The creation is very focused, so it is also an example of improvement in the dance popularization movement.

　　Although it still has some shortcomings in form, considering the author's motives and the above advantages in compilation, I think it is a work worth recommending to the whole country this year.

　　Now all field armies across the country have launched a dance movement of soldiers performing for soldiers. We should learn from the "Saber Dance" of the Inner Mongolia Cultural Troupe and launch a new military entertainment movement.

　　(According to the program of "Saber Dance" by the Inner Mongolia Cultural Troupe, the performers wear Inner Mongolian ethnic costumes. If the army learns it, they can wear their own army uniforms.)

　　推荐内蒙文工团的《马刀舞》
    吴晓邦
    在首都庆祝国庆的许多舞蹈演出中，《马刀舞》是使群众获得良好印象的节目之一。
    在这一个舞内充分表现了人民解放军的英勇、果敢、活泼和热烈的精神，而内容是和练兵竞赛相结合的。
    贾作光同志在这一个创作中把苏联舞蹈的精神结合到战士们生活中去，这是一个很好的群众性的舞蹈。
    《马刀舞》中的一举一动都是从部队战士们生活里提炼出来的。这是战士们自己的舞蹈。它表现了今天战士们的新爱国主义和伟大忘我的高贵品质。
    《马刀舞》的主题非常明显，适合战士们的文娱活动。作为战斗的精神教育来看，也是非常适宜的。同时可以在舞蹈学习中培养战士们健康和勇敢的气魄。
    《马刀舞》这一个形式在部队中并不是铺张浪费的，只要做一把铁壳假刀就可以解决表演上的物质条件。比起秧歌舞和腰鼓更适合战士们生活里的动作和姿态。
    《马刀舞》是非常整齐有力的，在部队中表演决没有丝毫不健康的地方。它是合乎战士们的要求的。即对于工农群众来说它也是他们所喜闻乐见的。在摸索怎样去搞战士舞或军人舞的过程中，它是我们良好的示范。在创作中做到非常集中，因而在舞蹈普及运动中也是一个提高的例子。
    虽然在形式上它还有些缺点，可是从作者的动机和编制上具有以上这几个优点来看，我认为它是本年度值得向全国推荐的作品。
    现在全国各野战军都展开了兵演兵的舞蹈运动。我们应该向内蒙文工团的《马刀舞》学习，展开新的部队文娱运动。
    （按内蒙文工团《马刀舞》的节目是穿内蒙民族的服装，如果部队去学习可以穿部队自己的服装。）
