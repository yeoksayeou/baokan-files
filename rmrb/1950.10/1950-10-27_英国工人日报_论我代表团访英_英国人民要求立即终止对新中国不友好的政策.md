    On Our Delegation's Visit to Britain
    The British People Demand an Immediate End to Unfriendly Policies Towards New China
    【Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 26th】The London Worker's Daily published an editorial on the 25th entitled "Our Friends," which stated: "The Chinese People's Delegation has been visiting our cities for a month. The members of the delegation are very pleased to have contact with the British people. They brought a message to Britain: 'China has stood up!'" The editorial then pointed out: "However, the Labour government and the Labour Executive Committee are still fantasizing that they can persecute the Chinese in Hong Kong and Malaya with equanimity; they have adopted a fickle and hesitant attitude towards China's entry into the United Nations; and they are participating in the aggression against China's neighbors. Their meeting with the Chinese People's Delegation came as a shock to them. Liu Ningyi's speech at Transport House exposed the hypocrisy of the British government's policies to the British people. The interests of the British people, more than the interests of the Chinese people, demand an immediate end to the current unfriendly policies towards China."

    论我代表团访英
    英国人民要求立即终止对新中国不友好的政策
    【新华社布拉格二十六日电】伦敦工人日报二十五日发表题为“我们的友人”的社论称：“中国人民代表团访问我国各城市已达一月之久了。该团团员们对于与英国人民的接触，深感愉快。他们给英国带来了一个消息：‘中国已经站起来了。’”社论接着指出：“然而，工党政府与工党执行委员会，却仍然幻想着还能泰然自若地迫害香港和马来亚的中国人；对中国加入联合国问题，采取了朝三暮四犹疑不定的态度；并且参与对中国邻邦的侵略。他们和中国人民代表团的会晤使他们大吃一惊。刘宁一在运输大厦所发表的谈话，在英国人民面前揭露了英国政府政策的虚伪。英国人民的利益较之中国人民的利益更要求立即终止目前对中国的不友好的政策。”
