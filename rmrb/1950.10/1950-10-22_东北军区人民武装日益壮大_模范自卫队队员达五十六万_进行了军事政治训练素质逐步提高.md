Xinhua News Agency, 21st: The Northeast Military Region's people's armed forces are growing stronger day by day. At present, the region's model militia has 563,774 members, who have undergone military and political training, gradually improving their quality. According to the results of a learning test held by the model militia in sixteen counties in August this year, the average score for military subjects was 82.3, and the average score for political subjects was 84.7.

During the Liberation War, model militia members widely undertook tasks such as stretcher-bearing, transportation, reconnaissance, guarding, and harassing the enemy, and enthusiastically joined the People's Liberation Army. In Jilin Province, the number of model militia members who joined the army accounted for 20% of the total number of members. After the liberation of the entire Northeast, they continued to perform tasks such as maintaining social order and protecting the people's production and construction. In Heilongjiang Province, after the green crops grew up this summer, the counties established joint defense organizations, posted sentries, and cooperated with the public security forces to suppress bandits, and exposed the rumors of saboteurs, protecting the rural production order. The model militia in various places put forward the slogan of "protecting roads, protecting bridges, and protecting forests" in defending production and construction. According to statistics from Jilin Province, more than 23,000 model militia members in the province participated in road protection teams, and they helped repair 225 kilometers of railways last year. Members who participated in forest protection teams extinguished 50 mountain fires last year, saving forests from fire damage. In addition, members in various places also actively took the lead in production and helped military families solve their difficulties. In a certain district of Jiaohe County, the number of model militia members participating in production mutual aid groups accounted for 80% of the total number of members. Yao Shusheng, the political officer of the Heping Village militia in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, who attended the National Combat Heroes Representative Meeting, took the lead in demonstrating in production. During the spring plowing and summer hoeing period this year, he mobilized 35 members of the entire team and 20 farmers to complete the five shovels and six trips plan.

The establishment of the Northeast People's Armed Forces has a history of nearly five years. In the process of establishing and developing the people's armed forces, some provinces have paid attention to the work of training cadres. The armed cadres training class held by the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Department has trained 340 cadres, and most counties in the province have also held short-term training courses, with 4,200 armed committee members, company commanders, and instructors having been trained. They have become the leading backbone in improving and training the people's armed forces.

　　东北军区人民武装日益壮大
    模范自卫队队员达五十六万
    进行了军事政治训练素质逐步提高
    【新华社二十一日讯】东北军区人民武装正日益壮大，目前全区模范自卫队已有队员五十六万三千七百七十四人，他们并进行了军事和政治的训练，逐步提高自己的素质。据今年八月份十六个县模范自卫队举行学习测验的成绩表明，军事课平均分数为八十二点三，政治课平均分数为八十四点七。
    模范自卫队队员们在解放战争中曾广泛地担任担架、运输、侦察、警戒和扰乱敌人等任务，并踊跃参加人民解放军，吉林省模范自卫队队员参军者即占队员总数的百分之二十。东北全境解放后是他们继续执行维持社会治安、保护人民生产建设等任务。黑龙江省模范自卫队在今年夏季青纱帐兴起以后，各县均建立了联防组织，站岗放哨，配合公安武装清剿土匪，并揭露破坏分子的造谣，保护了农村的生产秩序。各地模范自卫队在保卫生产建设上提出了“护路、护桥、护林”的口号。据吉林省统计，该省参加护路小组的模范自卫队队员有二万三千余名，他们在去年曾帮助补修铁路二百二十五公里。参加护林小组的队员，在去年曾扑灭了五十起山火，使森林免遭火害。此外，各地队员还积极带头生产，帮助军属解决困难。蛟河县某区模范自卫队参加生产互助组的队员，就占了队员总数的百分之八十。此次出席全国战斗英雄代表会议的黑龙江省克山县和平村自卫队政治干事姚树盛在生产中带头示范，他在今年春耕夏锄期中，曾发动全队三十五名队员和二十个农民完成了五铲六趟的计划。
    东北人民武装的建立已有近五年历史。在建立和发展人民武装过程中，有些省份注意了培养干部的工作。黑龙江省军事部举办的武装干部训练班，已训练了三百四十名干部，该省多数县份也举办了短期训练，已有武装委员、中队长、指导员等四千二百人受过了训练，他们并已在提高与训练人民武装中成为领导骨干。
