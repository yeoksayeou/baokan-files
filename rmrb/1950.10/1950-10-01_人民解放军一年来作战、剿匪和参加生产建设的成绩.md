　　Achievements of the People's Liberation Army in Combat, Bandit Suppression, and Participation in Production and Construction Over the Past Year
    With the enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, through operations on the mainland and at sea in the past year, has liberated all of the mainland except Tibet and liberated Hainan Island, the Zhoushan Islands, and most other islands adjacent to the mainland. In order to consolidate the local order of the new China, ensure the people's well-being, and carry out the work of eliminating the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the People's Liberation Army also participated in production and construction work without hindering the execution of the above-mentioned combat and bandit suppression tasks, in order to reduce the burden on the people, improve the lives of the troops, increase social wealth, and help the country's construction.
    Basically Liberated the Entire Mainland
    When the People's Republic of China was born last October, the Kuomintang reactionaries still controlled all or most of the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Xikang, and parts of Shaanxi, Hunan, and Hubei, and maintained two main forces under Bai Chongxi and Hu Zongnan. After the Second and Fourth Field Armies of the People's Liberation Army and part of the First Field Army launched the Hengyang-Baoqing Campaign in Hunan, the Southwest Campaign, the Guangdong-Guangxi Campaign, and the mopping-up operations against the remaining Chiang bandits entrenched in southern Yunnan and Xichang area of ​​Xikang from the beginning of October last year to the end of March this year, the above-mentioned areas were liberated, and the Bai and Hu bandit troops, known as elites, were wiped out, completely shattering the illusion of the American aggressors and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to resist stubbornly in the southwest region. In the northwest, a part of the First Field Army marched thousands of miles and entered Dihua, Xinjiang, in mid-October, finally completing the great feat of liberating the Northwest. During this period, generals such as Lu Han, Liu Wenhui, Deng Xihou, and Pan Wenhua, as well as many patriotic generals in the Kuomintang army, revolted and joined the ranks of the People's Liberation Army, thereby assisting the People's Liberation Army in rapidly disintegrating the enemy army, basically liberating the entire mainland, and maintaining local order.
    Cross-sea Operations Liberate Hainan, Zhoushan, Wanshan, Shengsi and Other Islands
    Since mid-April this year, the People's Liberation Army has begun larger-scale cross-sea operations. Without the cooperation of the navy and air force, a part of the Fourth Field Army landed on Hainan Island on April 17 with the assistance of the Qiongya Column of the Liberation Army, and completely liberated the island by April 30. Half a month later, a part of the Third Field Army landed on Zhoushan Island on May 16, and by the evening of the 18th, the entire Zhoushan Islands, a key strategic location for national defense on the southeast coast of China, was liberated. At this point, the illusion of American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek's remaining bandit gang to rely on the above two islands as a base for "blockading the mainland" has been shattered. The People's Liberation Army, with high morale and the spirit of swallowing mountains and rivers, continued to valiantly attack the remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandits entrenched on the islands adjacent to the mainland. A part of the Fourth Field Army launched three consecutive attacks on the Wanshan Islands outside the Pearl River Estuary from May 25 to August 4, liberating all the islands. A part of the Third Field Army liberated the Shengsi Islands outside the Yangtze River Estuary after fighting on July 17 and 18. The above two major field armies have also successively liberated some scattered islands adjacent to the mainland.
    Over Two Million Enemies Eliminated in the Past Year
    In the above-mentioned operations of the past year, the People's Liberation Army, according to incomplete statistics, eliminated approximately 2.06 million of Chiang Kai-shek's remaining bandit troops. Together with the achievements of the previous three years and four months of the Liberation War, a total of approximately 8.36 million of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops were eliminated.
    Tens of Thousands of Bandits Eliminated in the Past Year
    When the remaining bandits on the mainland were collapsing, some enemy bandits lurked in various newly liberated areas to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. The People's Liberation Army also carried out the work of eliminating bandits. The bandit suppression troops implemented the correct policy of combining military suppression with political striving and combining suppression with leniency. In the past year, hundreds of thousands of bandits have been suppressed in the Northwest, Southwest, Central South, and East China regions. As of now, the main bandits in the Northwest region have been basically eliminated, including the Usman and Yaolebos bandit troops, which were directly commanded by the special service agencies of American imperialism and engaged in rebellion in eastern Xinjiang. The main bandits in the Southwest region have been annihilated or suffered destructive blows. The banditry in the Northwest region, the Southwest region, and the heartland areas of Central South and East China has been basically eliminated. The social order of the new China is becoming increasingly stable.
    Participating in Production and Construction on a National Scale
    Simultaneously with combat and bandit suppression, the People's Liberation Army responded to Chairman Mao's call this year and participated in production and construction on a national scale. The achievements made by the Liberation Army on the production front echo the glorious victories on the military front in the past. This year, various units have cultivated more than 3.3 million mu of land, with abundant summer harvests, and are now actively preparing for the autumn harvest. In addition to agricultural production, the troops in the Northwest and Southwest Military Regions have also invested more than 100,000 people in the construction of the Tianshui-Baoji section and the Tianshui-Lanzhou section of the Longhai Railway and the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The troops stationed in Qinghai and Xinjiang have begun to develop and construct the border areas of the motherland in a planned way.
    The Liberation Army Vows to Liberate Taiwan, Tibet, Kinmen, Penghu Islands, and All Territories Belonging to China.
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a powerful military force armed with a high degree of revolutionary spirit and patriotism. It is loyally carrying out the great and glorious tasks entrusted to it by the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference last year. The People's Liberation Army is determined to liberate Taiwan, Tibet, Kinmen, the Penghu Islands, and all territories belonging to China from the hands of imperialist aggressors, in order to complete the great cause of unifying China. It will also strengthen the construction of national armed forces on the basis of the victory of the People's Liberation War, in order to consolidate national defense and defend the independence of the motherland, and completely smash any provocations and aggressions by the American aggressors.

### 人民解放军一年来作战、剿匪和参加生产建设的成绩

　　人民解放军一年来作战、剿匪和参加生产建设的成绩
    中国人民解放军在全国人民的热烈支援之下，在过去一年中经过在大陆上和海洋上的作战，业已解放了除西藏以外的全部大陆和解放了海南岛、舟山群岛以及其他邻近大陆的大部岛屿。人民解放军为了巩固新中国的地方秩序、保证人民安居乐业并进行了肃清国民党反动派余孽的工作，又在不妨碍执行上述作战和剿匪任务的条件下，参加了生产建设工作，借以减轻人民负担，改善部队生活，增加社会财富，帮助国家的建设。
    基本上解放了全部大陆
    当去年十月中华人民共和国诞生的时候，国民党反动派仍控制着广东、广西、四川、贵州、云南、西康等省的全部或大部和陕西、湖南、湖北的各一部，并保持着白崇禧、胡宗南两股主力。经过人民解放军第二、第四两大野战军及第一野战军一部从去年十月初旬到今年三月下旬所连续发动的湖南衡（阳）宝（庆）战役、西南战役、粤桂战役以及对盘踞在滇南及西康西昌地区残余蒋匪的扫荡等战役，即将上述地区解放，并将号称精锐的白、胡两股匪军歼灭，使美国侵略者及其走狗蒋介石匪帮企图利用西南地区负隅顽抗的幻梦完全破灭。在西北方面，第一野战军一部经过数千里艰苦行军于十月中旬进驻新疆迪化，最后完成了解放大西北的壮举。在这个时期内，有卢汉、刘文辉、邓锡侯、潘文华等将军及国民党军中许多爱国将领先后率部起义，参加了人民解放军的行列，从而协助人民解放军迅速地瓦解敌军、基本上解放全部大陆并维持了地方秩序。
    渡海作战解放海南、舟山、万山、嵊泗等岛屿
    自今年四月中旬起，人民解放军开始了较大规模的渡海作战。在没有海军和空军配合作战的情形下，第四野战军一部于四月十七日在解放军琼崖纵队的接应下登陆海南岛，至同月三十日即全部解放该岛。半个月后，第三野战军一部于五月十六日在舟山本岛登陆，至十八日晚，即将我国东南沿海国防战略要地的舟山群岛全部解放。至此，美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石残余匪帮妄图依托上述两岛作为“封锁大陆”基地的幻想已被粉碎。人民解放军战志昂扬，气吞山河，继续向盘踞在邻近大陆各岛上的蒋介石残匪英勇进击。第四野战军一部在五月二十五日到八月四日的期间内，向珠江口外的万山群岛连续发动了三次攻击，将该群岛全部解放。第三野战军一部经过七月十七、十八两日战斗，解放了长江口外的嵊泗列岛。上述两大野战军又陆续解放了邻近大陆的若干零星岛屿。
    一年来歼敌二百余万
    人民解放军在上述一年来的作战中，据不完全统计，共歼灭蒋介石残余匪军约二百零几万人。连同以前三年零四个月解放战争的战绩共计歼灭了蒋介石匪军约八百三十六万余人。
    一年来歼灭土匪数十万
    当大陆残匪土崩瓦解之际，有若干敌匪，潜藏在各新解放区进行反革命活动。人民解放军又进行了肃清土匪的工作。各剿匪部队执行了军事清剿与政治争取相结合和镇压与宽大相结合的正确方针，一年来，在西北、西南、中南、华东等地区剿灭土匪达数十万人。截至目前，西北地区的主要股匪已被基本肃清，其中包括直接受美帝国主义特务机关指挥的在新疆东部作叛乱活动的乌斯满、尧乐博斯匪部。西南地区的主要股匪已被歼灭或遭到歼灭性的打击。西北地区、西南地区、中南及华东两地腹心地区的匪患已基本肃清。新中国的社会秩序日益安定。
    在全国范围参加生产建设
    与作战和剿匪的同时，人民解放军在今年响应了毛主席的号召，在全国范围参加了生产建设。解放军在生产战线上所获得的成绩，与过去在军事战线上的辉煌胜利交相辉映。今年各部开垦的土地达三百三十多万亩，夏收丰硕，现在正积极准备秋收。除了进行农业生产以外，西北、西南两军区部队并以十余万人力投入修筑陇海铁路的天（水）宝（鸡）段、天（水）兰（州）段和成渝铁路的工程。青海、新疆的驻军已开始了有计划的开发和建设祖国边疆的工作。
    解放军誓必解放台湾、西藏、金门、澎湖列岛以及属于中国的全部领土。
    中国人民解放军是为高度的革命精神和爱国精神所武装起来的强大军事力量，它正忠诚地执行着去年中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领所赋予的伟大而光荣的任务。人民解放军誓必从帝国主义侵略者手中解放台湾、西藏、金门、澎湖列岛以及属于中国的全部领土，以完成统一中国的大业。它并在人民解放战争胜利的基础之上加强国家武装力量的建设，以巩固国防，保卫祖国的独立，彻底粉碎美国侵略者的任何挑衅和侵略。
