　　Bengbu Factory Party Committee
    Examines Bureaucracy in Rectification Campaign
    [This newspaper's Bengbu dispatch] The Bengbu Municipal Factory Party Committee convened a rectification meeting from September 22nd to 27th, gathering more than 20 factory (bureau) directors, branch secretaries, and municipal-level labor union chairpersons to examine the work of the Party Committee over the past six months. The meeting specifically examined the bureaucratic practices in leadership.

    Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the state-owned factories in Bengbu have made significant achievements in the past six months, which is to be affirmed. However, there are still many shortcomings in the work. The Factory Party Committee still suffers from bureaucratic work styles of being detached from reality and detached from the masses. The specific manifestations are: (1) The plan for the first half of 1950 was to maintain existing production and strive for partial development, but there was insufficient understanding of the production difficulties at the time, leading to a plan that was divorced from reality. For example, the original plan for the power plant required maintaining the sale of 100,000 degrees of electricity in the first half of the year, but it was only able to maintain 60,000 degrees; Baoxing Flour Mill faced difficulties in selling its products, but it was planned to add 24 more mills. (2) Without sufficient conditions, the over-quota reward method was not formulated, and quotas were not stipulated. The seven-grade wage system was rashly implemented, and in its implementation, excessive emphasis was placed on reducing costs, resulting in a general reduction in workers' wages. As a result of this bureaucracy, workers suffered an unwarranted reduction in their living standards, resulting in irreparable losses of abnormal production sentiment among workers for two or three months. (3) In the past year, more than ten campaigns such as donating year-end double pay, donating voluntary labor, and the "four liang of rice" disaster relief movement have been launched in state-owned factories. In these movements, the Party Committee often only checked the figures and rarely understood the workers' living and ideological situation. Whichever factory launched it quickly and in large numbers was considered to have done a good job. Although most of these movements were voluntary, many workers generated complaints and discontent. Especially after the "establishing merit and creating models" movement, many factories arbitrarily added shifts and hours, causing great dissatisfaction among workers. The factory Party committees were unaware of this, and those who were aware of it did not correct it in time. Party committee cadres who were dedicated to going into the factories to understand the work only talked to cadres, and did not understand the actual situation of the workers. In terms of work attitude, some comrades did not listen to the opinions of the masses, respect the opinions of the workers, and adopt an attitude of consulting with the masses when something happened, but casually expressed inappropriate opinions, causing dissatisfaction among the workers.

    The main root cause of bureaucracy is the existence of arrogance and complacency in thinking. As soon as there is a slight achievement in work, they become blindly optimistic and complacent. When they hear dissatisfied opinions from workers, they often think that this is an inevitable phenomenon in the work, and do not pay attention to it, so they cannot correct deviations in time, and they lack the foresight of leaders.

    The Bengbu Municipal Factory Party Committee has now decided to strengthen the specific practices of contacting the masses and contacting reality based on the shortcomings identified in the examination, in order to improve future work.

### 蚌埠工厂党委会  整风中检查官僚主义

　　蚌埠工厂党委会
    整风中检查官僚主义
    【本报蚌埠讯】蚌埠市工厂党委会于九月二十二日至二十七日召集各厂（局）长、支部书记及市级工会主席共二十余人，举行了整风会议，检查党委会半年来的工作。会上具体检查了领导上的官僚主义。
    在党委会的领导下，蚌埠各公营工厂半年来有显著成绩，这是肯定的。但在工作中还存在着不少缺点。工厂党委会仍存在着脱离实际、脱离群众的官僚主义作风。其具体表现为：（一）一九五○年上半年计划是维持现有生产，争取部分的发展，但对当时生产困难认识不足，以致计划脱离实际。如对电力厂的计划，原要求保持上半年售出电十万度，结果仅能保持六万度；宝兴面粉厂产品销路困难，但又计划增加二十四部磨。（二）条件不够，未制定超额奖励办法，未规定定额，即冒然实行七级工资制，在执行时又过分强调降低成本，致使工人工资普遍降低。这种官僚主义的结果，使工人遭受不应有的生活降低，造成了两三个月来工人生产情绪不正常没法弥补的损失。（三）一年来，在公营工厂中，曾发动献年终双薪、献义务工、四两米救灾运动等十余次。在这些运动中，党委会往往只检查数字，很少了解工人生活与思想情况。那一个工厂发动快，数目多，就以为那一个工厂搞得好。这些运动虽然大部分出于群众自愿，但也有不少工人产生了埋怨不满的情绪。特别是在立功创模运动以后，有不少工厂随便加班、加点，引起工人很大不满，工厂党委还不知道，已知道的也未及时纠正。党委会专职干部到工厂中去了解工作，只找干部谈话，不去了解工人实际情况。在工作态度上，有些同志不是倾听群众意见，尊重工人意见，抱着有事和群众商量的态度，而随便发表不妥当的意见，致引起工人不满。
    产生官僚主义的主要根源，是思想上存在骄傲自满的情绪。工作稍有成绩，即盲目乐观，沾沾自喜，听到工人中有不满的意见，常认为这是工作中必然的现象，不加重视，因而不能及时纠正偏向，和缺乏领导者的预见性。
    现蚌埠市工厂党委会已根据检查出的缺点，决定加强联系群众，联系实际的具体作法，以改进今后工作。
