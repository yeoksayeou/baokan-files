　　Unveiling the First Page of Farmland Irrigation Construction in New China
    ——A Record of Farmland Irrigation Construction in 1950
    By Our Reporter Lu Sheng

    I
    After the establishment of the Central People's Government, it convened the National Joint Conference on Water Conservancy in all liberated areas last November, which determined the basic policy for water conservancy construction this year: to prevent floods and build water conservancy projects to achieve the goal of developing production. It also determined that the focus of work should be: in areas threatened by floods, focus on flood control and drainage; in arid areas, focus on opening canals for irrigation. It also allocated more than one billion catties of millet for water conservancy construction, of which 19% was used for canal irrigation. At that time, the Central People's Government had just been established, and under the major tasks of eliminating remnants of the enemy, ensuring the supply of millions of people, and adjusting grain for disaster relief and preparing for famine with a focus on restoring the economy, it still took out so much money to build water conservancy projects, which was unprecedented in Chinese history. Since that meeting, farmland water conservancy work has been universally launched throughout the country. According to statistics by the end of September this year, the country has newly built and restored 71 large-scale canal projects, expanding the irrigation area by 6,861,199 mu and improving the irrigation area by 29,532,741 mu, providing a strong guarantee for this year's task of increasing grain and cotton production. No wonder tens of thousands of viewers at the National Exhibition of Model Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers marveled when they saw the chart of farmland water conservancy achievements in 1950. Many elderly people said: This unveils the first page of farmland water conservancy construction in New China.

    It is not surprising that people praise the achievements of farmland water conservancy construction in New China in this way, because in the long years of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, they not only perfunctorily dealt with water conservancy construction related to people's livelihoods, but also carried out destruction everywhere, making the original water conservancy projects in various places dilapidated due to long-term disrepair. As a result, floods occurred constantly every rainy season. In 1938, Chiang Kai-shek, the public enemy of the Chinese people, even breached the Yellow River embankment at Huayuankou in Henan, causing more than 17 million mu of fertile land in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces to be flooded and destroyed that year, and more than 6.1 million people to be displaced. It was not until the People's Liberation Army completely liberated Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu that people who had been displaced for many years gradually returned to their hometowns. The Kuomintang reactionaries also held water conservancy construction, how did they hold it? The evaluation of the people of Shaanxi to them is: "Donate money and donate food, can not be repaired year after year." For example, the well-known Luo Hui Canal in Northwest China is an example. As early as 1934, the Kuomintang reactionaries asked farmers to donate money and food, claiming to build the Luo Hui Canal; in the past sixteen years, farmers have donated more than 30 million silver dollars, but they have not seen a single release of water. By the time of liberation in 1949, even a few projects that had just been repaired were destroyed by Hu Zongnan's bandit army. In the half year after liberation, this famous canal was completely repaired and has been watered.

    II
    At the National Farmland Water Conservancy Conference on the 8th of this month, Zhang Zilin, Director of the Farmland Water Conservancy Bureau, emphasized in summarizing the achievements of farmland water conservancy construction in the past year that: In 1950, in addition to making many achievements in water conservancy irrigation, in terms of irrigation management, all parts of the country have initially transformed the past feudal management organizations, breaking the historical boundaries of districts, counties, special zones, and provinces, and organized unified management agencies based on canals. Many scientific systems have been established, reducing many water conservancy disputes that have never been resolved in history, and expanding the irrigation area. For example, after Shanxi unified the management of the Fen River Canal, it expanded the irrigation area by 200,000 mu. Ningxia Province unified the management of canals in eleven counties, abolished the water conservancy police management system, established a people's management system, and established a layer-by-layer responsibility system from main canals to capillary canals, eliminating the phenomenon of wasting water due to water conservancy disputes over the years.

    The acquisition of these achievements, in addition to the planned leadership of the Central People's Government and the serious water conservancy of local governments, is also because water conservancy cadres throughout the country have given full play to the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly. For example, when repairing the Guangji Canal in Pingyuan Province, the Pingyuan Engineering Team of the Central People's Government did not stop measuring in the wind and snow. Sometimes, the wind was particularly strong, and they squatted on the ground to look at the instruments. When it was dark, they scratched matches to look at the crosshairs. In order to seize the season and strive for construction during the slack farming season, they did not rest during the New Year, and continued to carry out surveying, making charts, project budgets, and construction plans. In the construction, they showed more selfless spirit. After the hard work of all the comrades in the engineering team, from the departure on January 7 to August 1, in seven months, a total of 188 square kilometers were measured, and 101 charts of the Guangji, Lifeng, and Chaiku canals were designed and drawn, and the masses were led to complete 44,828 meters of the main canal, excavating 591,270 cubic meters of earth and stone, and building 70 bridges, gates, dams, etc., so that the area can restore the irrigation area of 360,000 mu this year, which can increase grain production by 36 million catties. The Jinmen Canal in Hebei Province, the water lifting irrigation project in the Jiyun River, the Xuhui Canal in Shandong, the Dujiangyan in Sichuan, the Luohui Canal in the Northwest, and many large-scale electric irrigation projects in the Northeast were mostly completely destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries and then rebuilt by the People's Government. In the repair of these many channels, the completion of earthwork alone reached 360 million cubic meters. According to incomplete statistics, more than 4.6 million migrant workers participated in the repair process, and hundreds of thousands of commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army participated in the repair. In this spring's Yi River diversion project in northern Jiangsu, Xinan County dispatched 25,000 migrant workers, including more than 1,000 women who participated, and they carried soil like men. The famous Sister Chai can dig more than one cubic meter of soil a day. Feng Xucai's team, which drove stone rollers weighing more than 300 catties, averaged 110 cubic meters of rollers per person per day, so that the task of cutting off Maling Mountain in the Yi River diversion was completed ahead of schedule. In the dike construction in northern Jiangsu, one million farmers participated, including more than 77,000 women. When repairing the Luohui Canal in the Northwest, hundreds of thousands of people along the canal enthusiastically supported it, and the Luohui Canal, which was badly damaged by Hu Zongnan's bandit army, was completely repaired in only half a year. When repairing the Guangji Canal, 200,000 farmers along the canal actively excavated earthwork from beginning to end, so that the Guangji Canal completed the project according to plan. In order to complete the earthwork as soon as possible, many farmers gave full play to their creative spirit. For example, Zou Yun, a model worker in dike construction in Liaoxi Province, Northeast China, researched a new method of picking soil, which increased from 8 cubic meters per day to 23 cubic meters, creating the highest record for picking soil. The promotion of this method enabled all the migrant workers to increase from an average of 3 cubic meters of soil per person per day to 4.5 cubic meters, and the Liaohe River water conservancy project was completed ahead of schedule. In addition, hundreds of thousands of commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army who participated in the repair also played a great role in guaranteeing the repair project. For example, when building the Dujiangyan in Sichuan, a certain unit dug more than 20 city squares (one zhang long, one zhang wide, and one chi high is one city square) in four days, so that the weir was completed ahead of schedule. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang completed the Batihonghai Reservoir, Peace Canal, Xinsheng Canal and other projects before this year's wheat harvest, which can irrigate 1.2 million mu of dry land. The more than 4.8 million cubic meters of earthwork in the three major state-owned water conservancy projects in Chahar Province were completely completed by the People's Liberation Army stationed in Chahar Province. This spring, on the 400-mile-long Xin Yi River line, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in northern Jiangsu participated in the construction project. Bugler Xiao Yibo had to carry 160 baskets of soil every day, and Zhang Shishan, a model worker in the army, had to compete with Wang Daqiao, a hero of river excavation who was "the first in ten counties and famous in Huaihai", and he could carry four cubic meters of soil every day. Because of the unified leadership of the Central People's Government and the efforts of water conservancy cadres in various places, especially the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of farmers and the assistance of the People's Liberation Army, the farmland water conservancy construction in the first year of New China has achieved such great achievements.

    The National Farmland Water Conservancy Conference reviewed the shortcomings of farmland water conservancy work in 1950. For example, due to an incomplete understanding of the situation, some areas had blindness when formulating plans. The most prominent manifestation is that they like to do large projects, ignore small-scale irrigation projects, and are eager to achieve success in construction, greedy for more and rough. Some plans are not practical. For example, Hebei originally planned to dig 50,000 wells, but it was not completed. In terms of leadership, some areas called for more and did less, especially for less technical assistance to the masses, and the summary and exchange of the masses' experience were very insufficient. Some areas required more technical assistance from the masses, but failed to meet the requirements of the masses. In terms of irrigation management, some areas did not implement the management responsibility to the end, such as only managing the main canals and branches, and not managing the rest. As a result, some canals did not play the due irrigation role. Some areas (such as the Jiyun River irrigation project) did a better job in this regard, not only managing the main canals and branches, but also managing the bucket canals and capillary canals. In addition to completing the original plan of irrigating 50,000 mu of dry land, they also helped farmers irrigate 30,000 mu. It can be seen from the work in 1950 that the area that paid attention to relying on the masses to organize the masses, and helped the masses to summarize experience and improve technology, and paid attention to the mass small-scale irrigation projects, the achievements of that area were great. The area that blindly engaged in large projects, did not seriously rely on and mobilize and organize the masses, the achievements of that area were small. At the same time, it can be seen that the area that is scientifically and seriously managed, the less water conservancy disputes, the irrigation area can be expanded; otherwise, it will not achieve the original purpose and cannot fully exert the role of water volume. At this National Farmland Water Conservancy Conference, representatives of farmland water conservancy cadres in various parts of the country particularly deeply summarized this experience, and based on these experiences, specifically determined the guiding principles and tasks of the National Farmland Water Conservancy work in 1951.

    The general policy of the National Farmland Water Conservancy work in 1951 is: to extensively mobilize and organize the masses, vigorously restore, build and renovate farmland water conservancy projects. Use state investment loans in a planned and focused manner, and extensively organize mass funds and absorb private capital into farmland water conservancy undertakings. Help improve the original management mechanism, strengthen irrigation management, gradually achieve reasonable water use, and establish and improve various systems (such as water use management, project review, request for instructions, reporting and charging systems).

    In terms of irrigation projects: In 1951, it is required to restore, expand and renovate the irrigation area of 13 million mu. In terms of channels and ponds, it is necessary to improve the old and continue to complete the unfinished projects, and organize the masses to extensively develop medium and small projects. In terms of dike water irrigation, it is necessary to extensively develop waterwheels and wells, keel waterwheels, and focus on developing water pumps. The development of waterwheels and wells focuses on Hebei, Pingyuan, Shandong, and Henan, requiring the development of 100,000 waterwheels and the digging of 50,000 wells. The development of water pumps focuses on the two canals in East China and Central South China, requiring the development of 13,144 horsepower water pumps. In terms of business methods, loans to cooperatives and mutual aid groups are the main focus, and individual farmers or water scoop entrepreneurs should also be taken care of. Provinces with conditions can try to run pumping stations in order to absorb mechanical irrigation experience.

    In terms of irrigation management: In 1951, the first task is to establish and enrich the management agencies of provinces, special zones, and counties, focusing on improving large-scale projects (such as the major irrigation systems in Suiyuan, Ningxia, and Hebei), establishing management agencies for newly built irrigation projects (completed in 1949-1950), and systematically helping to improve the existing management agencies of the masses, and studying the management situation of irrigation projects across the country. Based on the irrigation management experience of the masses, combined with the experience of state-owned irrigation in the Bohai Sea area and the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi, study management methods and systems. Introduce and absorb the scientific experience of the Soviet Union, typical demonstration, in order to create irrigation management methods suitable for our country.

　　揭开新中国农田水利建设的第一页
    ——记一九五○年农田水利建设
    本报记者  鲁生
    一
    中央人民政府成立后，即在去年十一月召开了全国各解放区水利联席会议，决定了今年水利建设的基本方针是：防止水患，兴修水利，以达发展生产的目的。并确定工作重点是：在受洪水威胁的地区，着重于防洪排水，在干旱地区，着重于开渠灌溉，并拨发水利建设事业费十余亿斤小米，其中百分之十九用为开渠灌溉费。那时中央人民政府刚成立，在肃清残敌、保证数百万人员的供给与调剂粮食救灾备荒有重点的恢复经济等重大任务下，还拿出这么多钱来兴办水利，在中国历史上是空前的。从那次会以后，全国农田水利工作便在全国各地普遍展开。到今年九月底统计，全国单是新建和恢复的大型渠道工程即达七十一处，扩大灌溉面积达六百八十六万一千一百九十九亩，改善灌溉面积两千九百五十三万二千七百四十一亩，给今年增产粮棉的任务以有力保证。无怪在全国工农兵劳模成绩展览会上，数以万计的观众看到一九五○年的农田水利工作成绩图表时，叹赞不已。许多老年人说：这是揭开了新中国农田水利建设的第一页。
    人们这样称赞新中国农田水利建设的成绩并不奇怪，因为在国民党反动统治的漫长岁月里，对关系人民生计的水利建设，不仅是一贯敷衍搪塞，还到处进行破坏，使各地原有的水利工程，长期失修而残破不堪，因此每年雨季，水灾不断发生。到一九三八年，中国人民公敌蒋介石更在河南花园口掘开黄河大堤，使豫、皖、苏三省当年就有一千七百余万亩良田被水淹毁，六百一十多万人民流离失所，直到人民解放军完全解放豫、皖、苏后，流浪多年的人们才陆续重返家乡。国民党反动派也曾举办过水利建设，他们是怎样举办的呢？陕西人民给他们的评语是：“捐款捐粮，年年修不成。”如西北著名的洛惠渠就是一个例子。远在一九三四年时，国民党反动派即要农民捐款捐粮，扬言修建洛惠渠；十六年来，农民共捐出现洋达三千多万元，却还没见到放过一次水。到一九四九年解放前，连刚刚修好的几处工程，也被胡宗南匪军破坏了。解放后的半年中，这条有名的大渠即完全修复，并已放水。
    二
    在本月八日全国农田水利会议上，农田水利局张子林局长在总结一年农田水利建设成绩时着重提出：一九五○年除在水利灌溉上做出许多成绩外，在灌溉管理方面，全国各地已初步改造了过去的封建管理组织，打破了历史上区与区、县与县、专区与专区、省与省的本位界限，组织了以渠为单位的统一管理机构，并建立了许多科学制度，减少了历史上从来解决不了的许多水利纠纷。扩大了灌溉面积。如山西统一管理汾河渠后，即扩大灌溉面积二十万亩。宁夏省统一管理了十一县地区的渠道，取消了水利警察管理制度，建立了人民管理制度，并建立了从干渠到毛渠的层层负责制，消除了历年来因闹水利纠纷而浪费水量的现象。
    这些成绩的获得，除了中央人民政府的有计划领导和各地政府的认真兴办水利外，也是因为全国各地的水利干部发挥了高度的为人民服务的精神。如修复平原省广济渠时，中央人民政府平原工程队，在风雪中也没有停止测量。有时，风特别大，他们蹲在地下看仪器，天黑了，他们划着火柴看十字线。为了抓紧季节争取在农闲时施工，过年也不休息，依然进行着测量、制作图表、工程预算、施工计划等工作。在施工中，他们更表现了忘我精神。经过全工程队同志的艰苦努力，从一月七日出发到八月一日的七个月中，共测量了一百八十八平方公里，设计并绘制广济、利丰、柴库三渠的图表一百零一件，并领导组织群众完成干渠四万四千八百二十八米，凿土石方五十九万一千二百七十余方米，还建筑桥、闸、坝等七十座，使该地区在今年即可恢复灌溉面积三十六万亩，将可增产粮食三千六百万斤。河北省的金门渠，蓟运河的扬水灌溉工程，山东的绣惠渠，四川的都江堰，西北的洛惠渠，以及东北的许多大型电力灌溉工程，大部都是被国民党反动派彻底破坏后，又经人民政府重新修建起来的。在修复这许多渠道中，单完成土方即达三亿六千余万公方。据不完全统计，在修复过程中，参加修建的民工有四百六十余万人，参加助修的人民解放军指战员在数十万以上。在今春苏北导沂工程中，新安一县即出动两万五千民工，其中有一千多名妇女参加，她们和男人一样的抬土。有名的柴大嫂一天能凿一方多土。驾着三百斤以上石硪的冯许才班，每人每天平均打硪一百一十方，使导沂中切断马陵山的任务得以提早完成。在苏北修堤中，有一百万农民参加，其中有七万七千多名妇女。在西北修洛惠渠时，沿渠数十万人民热烈支持，把胡宗南匪军破坏得残破不堪的洛惠渠，仅半年时间就全部修复了。修复广济渠时，沿渠二十万农民，从始至终积极挖掘土方，使得广济渠按计划完成工程。为了早日完成土方，许多农民发挥了创造精神。如东北辽西省的修堤模范邹云，研究出挑土新法，由每日挑土八方增至二十三方，创造了挑土的最高纪录。这种办法推广开来，使全体民工由每日每人平均挑三方土增至四方半，辽河水利工程乃得提早完成。另外参加助修的数十万人民解放军指战员在修复工程中也起了极大的保证作用。如在修建四川的都江堰时，某部四天即挖土二十余市方（一丈长，一丈宽，一尺高为一市方）使该堰提早完成。驻新疆的人民解放军某部在今年麦收前即完成了巴提洪海水库、和平渠、新盛渠等多处工程，可浇旱地一百二十万亩。察哈尔省的三大国营水利工程中的四百八十多万公方的土方工程，是完全由驻察省的人民解放军完成的。今春在长达四百华里的新沂河线上，驻苏北地区的人民解放军某部参加了修建工程。司号员小伊波每天要抬一百六十筐土，部队劳动模范张士山要同“十县第一、淮海闻名”的挖河功臣王大锹竞赛，他每天能挑四方土。因为有了中央人民政府的统一领导和各地水利干部的努力，特别是广大农民的热烈支持和人民解放军的助修，才使新中国第一年的农田水利建设，获得了这样伟大的成绩。
    三
    全国农田水利会议检讨了一九五○年农田水利工作的缺点。如由于对情况了解不全面，有些地区在订计划时发生盲目性。表现最突出的是喜欢做大工程，忽视小型灌溉工程，施工中又急于求成，贪多粗糙。有的计划则不切合实际。如河北原计划打井五万眼，结果没有完成。在领导方面，有些地区号召多，做的少，特别是对群众技术帮助少，总结与交流群众的经验很不够。有些地区群众要求在技术上多予帮助，未能满足群众要求。在灌溉管理方面，有些地区没有把管理责任贯彻到底，如只管理了干渠支渠，其他就没管理，结果是有些渠没有发挥到应有的灌溉作用。有些地区（如蓟运河灌溉工程）在这方面做得较好，不仅管理到干渠支渠，还管理到斗渠毛渠，除完成灌溉五万亩旱田的原计划外，还帮农民灌溉三万亩。从一九五○年的工作中看出：那个地区注意了依靠群众组织群众，并帮助群众总结经验提高技术，和注意群众性的小型灌溉工程，那个地区的成绩就大。那个地区盲目的搞大工程，不认真依靠和发动组织群众，那个地区的成绩就小。同时也看出：那个地区管理得科学和认真，那个地区的水利纠纷就少，灌溉面积就能扩大；反之，则达不到原计划的目的，不能全部发挥水量的作用。在这次全国农田水利会议上，全国各地负责农田水利干部的代表，特别深刻地总结了这一条经验，并根据这些经验，具体确定了一九五一年全国农田水利工作的方针和任务。
    一九五一年全国农田水利的工作总方针是：广泛发动与组织群众，大力恢复兴修与整修农田水利工程。有计划有重点地运用国家投资贷款，大量组织群众资金与吸收私人资本投入农田水利事业。帮助改善原有管理机构，加强灌溉管理，逐步达到合理使水，并建立与健全各种制度（如用水管理、工程审核、请示、报告及收费等制度）。
    在灌溉工程方面：一九五一年要求恢复扩大与整修灌溉面积一千三百万亩。在渠道塘坝方面，要改善旧的和继续完成未完的工程，并组织群众大量发展中小型工程。在堤水灌溉方面要大量发展水车水井、龙骨水车，有重点地发展抽水机。水车水井的发展以河北、平原、山东、河南为重点，要求发展水车十万辆，增打水井五万眼。抽水机以华东、中南两渠为发展重点，要求发展抽水机一三、一四四匹马力。在经营方式上，以出贷给合作社互助组为主，对个体农民或戽水企业家也应照顾。有条件的省份可试办抽水站，以便吸取机械灌溉经验。
    在灌溉管理方面：一九五一年，首先要建立与充实省专、县的管理机构，重点改进大型工程（如绥远、宁夏及河北各大灌溉系统），设立新建灌溉工程（一九四九——一九五○年完成者）的管理机构，有计划地帮助改善群众已有管理机构，并研究全国灌溉工程的管理情况，以群众的灌溉管理经验为基础，结合渤海区及陕西关中区国营灌溉的经验，研究管理方式与制度。并介绍吸收苏联的科学经验，典型示范，以便创造出适于我国的灌溉管理方法。
