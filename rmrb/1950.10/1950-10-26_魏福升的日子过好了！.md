　　Wei Fusheng's Life Has Improved!
    Wei Fusheng is from Mofang Village, Dongguang County, Shandong Province. His family was very poor, with only 1.6 mu of land. After liberation, his family was allocated more than six mu of land. Through hard work, his life has become better than before. Now he has also opened a cotton ginning workshop and started a side business. The ginned cotton is all handed over to the Qincun Cotton Yarn and Cloth Office. On October 9th, the office changed to a new person, who gave Wei Fusheng an extra 47,600 yuan. Wei Fusheng found out he had been overpaid when he got home. He thought: Although the office might not easily find out about this money, I really shouldn't keep it without returning it to the public. We used to be poor people. Thanks to the Communist Party and the People's Government for their help, we have food to eat. I shouldn't deceive the office! He made up his mind and sent all the extra money back to the office the next morning.

　　魏福升的日子过好了！
    魏福升是山东东光县磨房村人，家很贫苦，只有一亩六分地。解放后，他家分了六亩多地，辛勤耕作，日子就比过去好过了。现在他又开了个轧花房，搞起副业来了。轧出的花，都交给秦村的花纱布办事处。十月九日，办事处换了一个新人，他多给了魏福升四万七千六百元。魏福升回家后查出多收了钱。他想：这笔钱虽然办事处不易查出来，但是我要是不还给公家，实在不应该。我们过去是穷人，多亏了共产党和人民政府帮助才有饭吃，我不应欺骗办事处！他拿定了主意，第二天早晨即把多给的钱全部送回办事处了。
