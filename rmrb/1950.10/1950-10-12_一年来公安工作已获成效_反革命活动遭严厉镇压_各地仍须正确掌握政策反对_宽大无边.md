　　【Our Newspaper's Dispatch】Various counter-revolutionary activities instigated by American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek in mainland China have been severely suppressed by the People's Public Security organs of our People's Republic of China. Apart from a considerable number of Kuomintang bandits in the newly liberated areas being wiped out by our heroic People's Liberation Army, leaving only some remnants, from October of last year to September of this year, our public security departments have successively captured over 13,000 special agents. Several espionage cases directly conducted by American imperialism in China were also cracked. A total of 175 radio stations belonging to these special agent organizations were seized. Of these captured special agents, a portion of the coerced followers were treated leniently in accordance with the principle of leniency, while those ringleaders who had been proven to be truly guilty of heinous crimes and were unrepentant were suppressed by the People's Government, and a portion of them were sentenced to death. For example, Li Huatang, a Kuomintang Military Intelligence Bureau major general-level big special agent, had repeatedly directly and indirectly instigated riots in places like Suxian, Tongshan, Huangkou, Dangshan, and Mengcheng, using secret society organizations. After these riots were suppressed by us, this March he again attempted to organize over 5,000 members of various secret societies around Xuzhou to stage a riot, but was uncovered by our People's Public Security organs. Li Huatang and 28 other important criminals were successively arrested, and the bandit Li has been executed according to law. This May, Chiang bandit Mao Sen dispatched over a hundred armed special agents who secretly landed from Dazhushan Haikou near Qingdao, but were annihilated by our coastal defense forces, public security forces, and militia in coordination. 104 bandits, including the bandit commander, were captured. Among them, apart from those who were given prison sentences or released according to the severity of their crimes, 25 of the most heinous special agents were sentenced to death. Others, such as Chen Dengmin, commander of the "Anti-Communist People's National Salvation Army" Third Column, who attempted to organize a riot in Chahar, and Luo Bingqian, who provided intelligence to enemy aircraft for bombing targets in Shanghai, and Ji Zhaoxiang, who installed a hidden radio station in Beijing to gather intelligence for the enemy, were all resolutely executed by the People's Government. In addition, espionage activities directly organized by American imperialism in our country have also suffered a heavy blow. For example, the case of American spy Sasaki Hirotsune and others, which was tried by the Shenyang Municipal People's Court last November, is a notable example. Our People's Public Security organs have also successively cracked cases of American imperialism using pro-American elements such as Xiong Xianli and White Russian Yelodoff to engage in intelligence activities. This not only demonstrates that American imperialism is directly opposed to the Chinese people, but also proves that any activities carried out by American imperialism in China that endanger the Chinese people are bound to meet with a shameful defeat. Today, although our people's great revolution has achieved a basic victory, and the Kuomintang reactionary regime has been fundamentally overthrown, hidden special agents and bandits are still attempting to lie low and sabotage, and conduct a long-term struggle against us. Over the past year, these hidden enemies have adopted various methods to carry out sabotage activities: such as collecting intelligence, spreading rumors to confuse the public, assassinating cadres, organizing armed harassment, instigating secret society riots, sabotaging important economic facilities, sowing discord to undermine our internal unity, or disguising themselves as progressives to undermine state policies, using all sorts of forms to commit evil. Every Chinese person should heighten their vigilance so that the enemy's conspiracies and tricks cannot succeed. At the same time, local government organs must correctly implement the policy of "the ringleaders must be punished, the coerced followers will not be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded," and give those ringleaders severe suppression. In the past, the handling of counter-revolutionary cases in many places was biased, that is, one-sidedly emphasizing leniency even towards resolute counter-revolutionary elements, causing dissatisfaction among the masses, so that the masses complained that the People's Government was "limitlessly lenient." This erroneous tendency should be overcome. If the American-Chiang special agents dare to continue to be enemies of the Chinese people, then their future will only be one thing: destruction.

### 一年来公安工作已获成效  反革命活动遭严厉镇压  各地仍须正确掌握政策反对“宽大无边”

　　一年来公安工作已获成效
    反革命活动遭严厉镇压
    各地仍须正确掌握政策反对“宽大无边”
    【本报讯】美国帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石在中国大陆所策动的各种反革命活动，已遭到我中华人民共和国人民公安机关的严厉镇压。除在新区相当大量的国民党土匪被我英勇的人民解放军清剿得只剩若干残余以外，从去年十月至今年九月先后被我公安部门捕获的特务分子达一万三千余人。并破获美帝国主义在中国所直接进行的间谍案件数起。缴获的特务机关的电台共一百七十五部。这些落网的特务，除一部分胁从分子根据宽大原则从轻处理以外，那些已经证明确属作恶多端怙恶不悛的首要分子，人民政府已将其中一部予以镇压，判处死刑。如国民党军统少将级的大特务李华堂，历次直接间接在宿县、铜山、黄口、砀山、蒙城等地利用会门组织暴动被我平伏后，今年三月又妄图在徐州周围组织各种会门五千余人举行暴动，被我人民公安机关破获，李华堂等重要人犯二十八名均先后落网，李匪已枪决正法。今年五月蒋匪毛森派遣武装特务百余自青岛大珠山海口偷偷上岸，为我海防部队及公安部队、民兵配合剿灭，俘匪纵队长以下一百零四名，其中除按情节轻重分别处以徒刑或释放以外，首恶特务二十五人均判处死刑。他如企图在察哈尔组织暴乱的“反共人民救国军”第三纵队司令陈登民，在上海为敌机供给轰炸目标等情报的罗炳乾，在北京安设潜伏电台为敌刺探情报的计兆祥等死心作恶的特务分子，人民政府均予以坚决处决。另外，美帝国主义在我国所直接组织的间谍活动亦遭到沉重的打击。如去年十一月沈阳市人民法院所审判的美国间谍佐佐木弘经等一案就是显著的例子。我人民公安机关并曾先后破获美帝国主义利用亲美分子熊先立、白俄耶洛多夫从事情报活动的案件。这不仅说明了美帝国主义直接与中国人民为敌，也证明了美帝国主义在中国所进行的任何危害中国人民的活动，均必然遭到可耻的失败。今天我国人民大革命虽然已经取得基本胜利，国民党反动政权已被根本打倒，但暗藏的特务匪徒仍企图潜伏破坏，长期与我进行斗争。一年来这些暗藏的敌人采取了各种办法进行破坏活动：如搜集情报，造谣惑众，暗杀干部，组织武装袭扰，策动会门暴动，破坏重要经济设施，挑拨离间我内部的团结，或伪装进步破坏国家政策，用各种各样的形式，为非作恶。每个中国人民都应提高警惕，使敌人阴谋诡计无法得逞。同时各地政权机关必须正确执行“首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖”的政策，给那些首恶分子以严厉的镇压。过去对于反革命案件的处理，有不少地方是有偏向的，即对于坚决反革命分子也片面地强调了宽大，造成群众的不满，以致群众埋怨人民政府“宽大无边”。这种错误倾向是应该克服的。如果美蒋特务分子敢于继续与中国人民为敌，那他的前途只有一个，就是毁灭。
