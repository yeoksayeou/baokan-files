Achievements of the Northeast Labor Movement in the Past Year
    Zhang Weizhen, Chairman of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions

    In the year since the founding of the great People's Republic of China, the working class of Northeast China, with selfless and heroic labor, has overcome numerous difficulties and achieved great success in the industrial construction of Northeast China.

    For more than a year, under the direct leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions has developed 1,050,000 trade union members (excluding those in the ordnance industry) and launched production movements of ever-increasing scale. This has enabled the masses of laborers in Northeast China to appear for the first time in history as conscious creators on the economic construction front, demonstrating their skills and giving full play to their wisdom and talents. Various heroic and model figures have emerged in the struggle to protect factories, donate equipment, economize, innovate records, and engage in production competitions. For example, Zhao Guoyou took the lead in launching a record-breaking movement throughout the region, and the advanced production methods of the Ma Hengchang team and the "Iron Ox" locomotive movement created by Du Xianyang in the railway system have greatly promoted production and construction. In terms of factory management, Factory Director Zhao Lan implemented policies of democratic management, cared for the lives of workers, and mobilized technicians to go deep into the field to study and improve technology. Factory Director Dong Chen learned from advanced Soviet experiences, relied on all employees, changed the organizational structure of the factory, and implemented a scientific management system of production instruction charts. In terms of technical personnel, Engineer Sun Zhaosen and others combined with workers to create outstanding achievements and become typical examples. In terms of safety responsibility systems, the Shi Yuhai team in the coal mine achieved a record of no deaths for four years. In terms of trade union work, Nie Bingju organized employees to break records, sign contracts, and mobilize all workers in the factory to make production plans, which improved the quality of production and exceeded the original targets. Women workers have played a very important role in production. More than 21% of the new record creators in Andong City are women. In the Lushun-Dalian area, more than 2,400 women workers have participated in heavy industrial production. In cities such as Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin, many female streetcar drivers have emerged. Northeast women workers have seen the emergence of model figures such as Zhao Guilan, Tian Guiying, and Chang Yongfen. With these production models and experiences, we have been able to overcome difficulties at every stage and achieve great results. Last year's total production exceeded the original plan by 19.8%; in the first half of this year, it exceeded the six-month production plan by 5.7%, which is equal to 131% of last year's total output. Our labor productivity has increased, and in the first half of this year it was equal to 251.8% of the actual productivity in the first half of last year. Due to the recovery and development of state-owned and public-owned enterprises and agricultural production, the implementation of the policy of "developing production to benefit both labor and capital," and the active production of workers in private enterprises, the production of private enterprises has also developed. Taking Shenyang as an example, in April of this year, the number of private factories in the city had increased from 6,546 at the time of liberation to 13,459, and the number of employees had increased from 26,008 to 56,328. Comparing April 1949 with April this year, the capital stock has increased from 710.5 million yuan to 170.81 billion yuan.

    The past year has enabled us to make "a good initial start" in industrial construction in Northeast China.

    With the development of production, unemployment has been basically eliminated among workers in Northeast China (an increase of more than 300,000 employees this year), and the lives of workers have gradually improved. From the liberation of the entire Northeast region to the end of last year, the actual wages of workers increased by 27%, and after the implementation of the eight-grade wage system, they increased by another 8%. The state has also established many labor protection undertakings, and 768 units with 666,556 employees (excluding the ordnance industry) (87,669 unregistered) have implemented labor insurance. According to incomplete statistics at the end of July this year: there are currently 22 sanatoriums, 4 nursing homes, 6 nurseries, 54 kindergartens, 67 hospitals, and 563 clinics, with an average of 457.4 workers (according to statistics from units under the Ministry of Industry) served by one doctor and 97.7 workers served by one health worker.

    Cultural facilities for workers are also gradually increasing. Now most of the large factories and mines have clubs and libraries. According to incomplete statistics: there are 3,874 workers' spare-time cultural schools, with 297,096 workers participating in learning. The number of workers' spare-time cultural schools in the railway system has doubled compared to May of this year and increased more than four times compared to last year; more than 50,000 young workers have participated in spare-time technical schools by June this year; 19,390 young workers have signed apprenticeship contracts (excluding Liaodong, Rehe, and Inner Mongolia), and 16,963 young workers and members of the Communist Youth League have created 37,502 new records.

    After a year of practical work and exploration, especially after this rectification under the leadership of the Northeast Bureau, the leadership of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions has begun to clarify in thought the specific historical conditions of the current trade union work, and has recognized the trade union's position and responsibilities in production, as well as how to unite the entire working class to fight for improving business management, reducing costs, improving quality, and overcoming waste. In mass production work, we have also explored some good organizational forms and working methods, such as using collective contracts to turn the state's production plan into the masses' own plan, so that the masses of workers can consciously work; implementing democratic management, clarifying the responsibilities between the administration and the trade union in the enterprise, and between the various production departments, thereby strengthening the unity of employees and correctly implementing the production responsibility system and the policy of giving consideration to both public and private interests. The advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang team has been promoted and has now created advanced production teams representing various production characteristics in various industries. Now enterprises are further organizing regular production competitions. All this has laid a solid foundation for the future development of the workers' movement.

    Living facts prove the superiority of the people's democratic power led by the working class. This is an unprecedented regime in Chinese history, and it cannot be compared with the social systems of any feudal or capitalist countries. In just over a year, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we have been brought a happy and good start, and a beautiful future has been shown before us. Peace-loving people all over the world are cheering and congratulating us for our happy life, and we, the working class, are also contributing all our labor and wisdom to create a better future.

　　一年来东北工运的成果
    东北总工会主席  张维桢
    在伟大的中华人民共和国成立后的一年中，东北工人阶级以忘我的英勇劳动，克服重重困难，使东北工业建设获得了很大的成就。
    一年多以来，东北工会在中华全国总工会和中共中央东北局直接领导下，发展了一百零五万工会会员（兵工在外），发动了一个时期比一个时期规模更大的生产运动，使东北劳动群众在历史上首次以自觉的创造者的姿态出现在经济建设战线上，显露了自己的本领，发挥了自己的智慧和才能，在护厂斗争、献纳器材、节约运动、创新纪录运动及生产竞赛中，出现了各种英雄模范人物。如赵国有带头掀起的全境范围的创新纪录运动，马恒昌小组的先进生产方法，杜先扬在铁路系统中所创造的铁牛机车运动，对生产建设起了巨大的推动作用。在工厂管理上，出现了赵岚厂长贯彻管理民主化的政策，关心工人生活，发动技术员深入现场钻研、改进技术；和董晨厂长学习苏联先进经验，依靠全体职工，改变工厂的组织机构，实行生产指示图的科学管理制度的模范。技术人员方面，出现了孙照森工程师等与工人结合，创造显著成绩典型范例。安全责任制上，出现了煤矿施玉海小组四年未发生死亡事故的纪录。在工会工作方面，出现了聂秉举组织职工创纪录、订合同，发动全厂工人普遍订生产计划，使全厂提高了生产质量，超过原定任务的范例。女工在生产中发挥了很重要的作用。安东市新纪录创造者中，有百分之二十一以上是女工。在旅大区，有二千四百余名女工参加了重工业生产。在沈阳、长春、哈尔滨等城市，出现了许多女电车司机。东北女工人，已出现了赵桂兰、田桂英、常永芬等模范人物。有了这些生产模范和经验，使我们能够突破每一时期的困难，获得巨大成绩。去年生产总量即超过了原计划百分之十九·八；今年上半年超过六个月生产计划百分之五·七，等于去年全年产量的百分之一百三十一。我们的劳动生产效率提高了，今年上半年等于去年上半年实际生产率的百分之二百五十一·八。由于国公营企业和农业生产的恢复与发展，由于贯彻“发展生产劳资两利”的政策，由于私营企业工人的积极生产，私营企业的生产也在发展。以沈阳为例，今年四月份该市私营工厂已从解放当时的六五四六户增加到一三四五九户，职工从二六、○○八人增加到五六、三二八人，资本金以一九四九年四月与今年四月来比较，从七、一○五亿元增至一七、○八一亿元。
    过去一年，使我们东北在工业建设上“有了一个初步良好的开端”。
    随着生产的发展，东北工人基本上已消灭了失业现象（今年增加职工三十余万人），工人的生活也逐步的得到改善。自东北全境解放到去年年底，工人实际工资提高了百分之二十七，自实行八级工资制后，又提高了百分之八；国家并办了许多劳保事业，已有七六八个单位，六六六、五五六名职工（除兵工）（未登记者八七、六六九）实行了劳动保险。据今年七月底不完全统计：现有疗养院二十二处，养老院四处，保育院六处，托儿所五四处，医院六七处，医务所五六三处，平均四五七·四个工人（只据工业部所属各单位统计）有一个医生，九七·七个工人有一个卫生工作人员来服务。
    工人的文化设施，也逐步增加。现在大的厂矿大部都有俱乐部和图书馆。根据不完全统计：有工人业余文化学校三、八七四所，有二十九万七千零九十六名工人参加学习。铁路系统的工人业余文化学校比今年五月增加一倍，比去年增加了四倍多；青年工人至今年六月已有五万余名参加了业余技术学校学习；一万九千三百九十名青工订立了师徒合同（辽东、热河、内蒙不在内），并有一万六千九百六十三名青年工人和青年团员，创造了三七、五○二件新纪录。
    经过一年来实际工作的摸索，尤其是在东北局领导下经过这一次整风，东北工会的领导方面已在思想上开始明确了当前工会工作的具体历史条件，认识了工会在生产中的地位和责任，以及如何团结全体工人阶级，为改善经营管理，降低成本，提高质量，克服浪费而斗争。在群众生产工作上也摸索到了一些良好的组织形式与工作方法，如运用集体合同，使国家的生产计划变成群众自己的计划，使职工群众能够自觉的劳动；贯彻了民主管理，分清了企业中行政与工会之间的、各个生产部门之间的职责，从而加强了职工团结，正确的贯彻了生产责任制和公私兼顾的政策。马恒昌小组的先进经验，从推广到现在，已在各种产业中创造出代表各个生产特点的先进生产小组。现在各企业正进一步组织经常性的生产竞赛。这一切，也就奠定了今后职工运动发展的有力基础。
    活生生的事实证明了工人阶级领导的人民民主政权的优越性，这是中国历史上空前未有的政权，也是任何封建主义与资本主义国家的社会制度所不能比拟的。仅仅一年多来，在毛主席英明的领导下，已给我们带来了幸福的良好开端，在我们面前展现了美丽的远景，全世界爱好和平的人民都在为我们的幸福生活而欢呼祝贺，我们工人阶级也为创造美好的将来而贡献自己全部的劳动和智慧。
