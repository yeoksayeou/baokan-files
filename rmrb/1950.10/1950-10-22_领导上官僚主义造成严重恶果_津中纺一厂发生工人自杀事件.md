　　Bureaucracy of Leadership Causes Serious Consequences: Suicide Incident at Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Mill
　　The Ministry of Textile Industry and the Textile Workers' Union of China have properly handled the matter and issued a circular to all regions to learn from this incident.
　　[This newspaper dispatch] A suicide incident occurred at the Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Mill on July 27th, involving worker Zhang Lianfang. This was a result of serious bureaucracy among the administrative leadership of the factory, a lack of a clear understanding of the need to rely on the working class, the failure to implement the policy of democratic factory management, and the irresponsibility of the factory's trade union in protecting the vital interests of the workers. The Ministry of Textile Industry and the Textile Workers' Union of China have properly handled this incident and jointly issued a circular on October 14th, educating administrative managers and trade union workers in the textile industry.
  The Course of the Incident
　　Recently, due to production needs, the Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Mill planned to abolish the joint stock workshop. Over 150 workers in the workshop were to be transferred. Regarding such a large-scale transfer of workers, the factory's administrative leaders adopted a compulsory order to transfer them in batches without research, publicity, or mobilization, causing widespread dissatisfaction among the workers. During the seventh batch of transfers, the joint meeting of the workshop's Party, administrative, and union representatives decided to transfer Zhang Lianfang and four others. The meeting was chaired by technician Qian Fang, and participants included workshop administrative team leaders Yang Fade, Niu Quan, Huang Wenying, and Zhang Zihua, director of the union workshop committee, and Gu Henian, cultural and educational committee member. Zhang Lianfang was the weigher (secretary worker) of the joint stock workshop and also the deputy director of the union workshop committee, but he was not allowed to participate. The next day, administrative team leader Yang Fade issued the transfer order, assigning Zhang Lianfang to the cloth yard to work as a shuttle loader. Zhang Lianfang felt that he was too tall to be a shuttle loader and expressed his disagreement with the transfer. Niu Quan and Gu Henian did not get along with Zhang Lianfang and often suppressed him. Yang Fade, not understanding these circumstances, listened to Niu Quan's words one-sidedly and implemented the decision of the meeting. Niu Quan was originally an old foreman who oppressed workers before liberation when he served as an assistant. After criticism and reflection after liberation, he was demoted to team leader. After Zhang Lianfang was transferred to the cloth yard, the cloth yard felt that he was too tall to load shuttles, so he was transferred to arrange yarn tubes. Arranging yarn tubes was mostly done by elderly and weak workers, which made Zhang Lianfang even more dissatisfied. Therefore, Zhang went to technician Qian, Yang Fade, and the vice chairman of the factory union several times, raising his objections to the transfer, but he did not receive due attention or resolution. Zhang Lianfang was very distressed and felt that he had nowhere to turn for help. In a moment of despair, he drowned himself in a pit.
  Handling of the Incident
　　After the incident occurred, it immediately attracted the attention of the Ministry of Textile Industry and the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China. Responsible comrades were immediately dispatched to Tianjin to cooperate with the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China and the administrative and union committees of the Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Mill to conduct an investigation. After repeated studies and reviews, appropriate measures have now been taken: the factory's administrative side will issue 500 catties of corn flour for the deceased's funeral expenses, and the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China will issue relief funds to the family in accordance with the Tianjin Municipality's Provisional Regulations on Labor Insurance for Non-Work-Related Deaths; workshop administrative team leaders Niu Quan and Yang Fade have been dismissed from their positions, Yang Fade has been demoted to a second-class worker, and Niu Quan has been demoted to a third-class worker. They have also been ordered to make self-criticisms at the workshop assembly and accept mass criticism. Zhang Zhenhua, the military representative of the factory, was severely criticized for insufficient understanding and ineffective implementation of democratic management. After the incident, Zhang made several self-criticisms and actively participated in the aftermath. After talking with Comrade Chen Shaomin, chairman of the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, he gained a further understanding of his mistakes. Therefore, in addition to requiring him to continue to conduct in-depth self-criticism during the rectification movement and actively improve factory management, no other punishment will be imposed. The factory union leader took an irresponsible attitude towards the worker transfer work and failed to effectively protect the workers' vital interests. He has conducted self-criticism at the workshop assembly and the Tianjin Municipal Congress of Textile Workers' Union Members and has requested punishment, requesting a re-election. Xu Ming, chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, also made a self-criticism for insufficient leadership and education by the municipal committee.

　　领导上官僚主义造成严重恶果
    津中纺一厂发生工人自杀事件
    中央纺织工业部和中国纺织工会已妥善处理，并通报各地接受这一事件的教训。
    【本报讯】天津中纺一厂七月二十七日发生工人张连舫自杀事件。这是该厂行政领导上存在着严重的官僚主义，缺乏明确的依靠工人阶级的思想，没有贯彻工厂管理民主化的方针，以及该厂工会不负责任，未能保护工人切身利益的结果。中央纺织工业部和中国纺织工会对此事件已经妥善处理完毕，并于十月十四日联合发出通报。教育纺织工业中的行政管理人员和工会工作人员。
  事件发生经过
    中纺一厂最近因生产需要，准备取消合股间，该车间一百五十多个工人准备全部调动。对于这样大规模调动工人的重大问题，该厂行政负责人采取了不研究、不宣传、不动员的强迫命令分批调开的办法，引起工人普遍不满。第七批调动时，由车间党、政、工联席会议决定，调动张连舫等五人的工作。那次会议由钱方技师主持，参加者有车间行政组长杨发德、牛铨、黄文英，及工会车间委员会主任张子华，文教委员顾鹤年。张连舫是合股间的过磅工（书记工），又是工会车间委员会副主任，但却没有让他参加。第二天，行政组长杨发德下了调动命令，让张连舫去布场担任装梭工。张连舫因个子太大，做装梭工不合适，对这种调动表示不同意。牛铨、顾鹤年与张连舫感情不合，时常打击张连舫，杨发德不了解这些情况，片面听信牛铨的话，就执行会议的决定。牛铨原是旧把头，在解放前任助理员，压迫工人。解放后经检讨反省后，被降为组长。张连舫调到布场后，布场认为他个子太高，不适合装梭，又调去摆纱管。摆纱管多为老弱工人，张连舫更加不满。因此张曾先后去找钱技师、杨发德和厂工会副主席，几次提出不同意调动的意见，但都未得到应有的重视和解决。张连舫十分苦恼，觉得有苦无处诉，最后一时心窄，竟投水坑自杀身死。
  事件处理经过
    事件发生后，立即引起中央纺织工业部和中国纺织工会全国委员会的注意，立即派负责同志到天津协同中国纺织工会天津市委员会、中纺一厂的行政方面和工会委员会进行调查。经过反复研究和检讨，现已作适当处理：由一厂行政方面发给死者丧葬费五百斤玉米面，由中国纺织工会天津市委员会按天津市劳动保险暂行条例非因公死亡办法发给家属救济费；车间行政组长牛铨、杨发德撤消组长职务，杨发德降为二等工，牛铨降为三等工，并令他们在车间大会检讨，接受群众批评，一厂军代表张振华对于民主管理认识不足，执行不力，已予以严厉批评。张在事件发生后，几次进行检讨，积极参加善后工作，又经与中国纺织工会全国委员会主席陈少敏同志谈话后，对错误有了进一步的认识，因此，除令其在整风中继续深刻检讨，积极改进工厂管理以外，不再另予处分。一厂工会负责人对工人调动工作，采取不负责任的态度，未能切实保护工人的切身利益，已在车间大会和纺织工会天津市会员代表大会上进行了自我检讨，并已自请处分，要求改选；中国纺织工会天津市委员会主席许明对市委员会的领导和教育不够，也作了自我批评。
