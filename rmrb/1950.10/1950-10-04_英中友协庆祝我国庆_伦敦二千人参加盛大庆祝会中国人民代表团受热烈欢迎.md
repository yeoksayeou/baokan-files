Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 3rd: London dispatch: The Sino-British Friendship Association held a grand gathering in St. Pancras Town Hall, London, on October 1st to celebrate the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Nearly two thousand British people attended the meeting. The Chinese People's Delegation, headed by Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, was warmly and friendly welcomed.
　　
The meeting received congratulatory telegrams from Reverend Dixon, head of the Church Council of Great Britain and Ireland, and Labour MP Bing En, among others. Reverend Dixon praised the progress made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Central People's Government and paid tribute to the Chinese people on behalf of Christians in Britain and Ireland.
　　
The meeting proceeded in an atmosphere of enthusiasm, especially when the main speaker, Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese People's Delegation, delivered his speech, applause erupted like a storm and lasted for a long time. In his speech, Liu Ningyi recounted the achievements of the People's Republic of China over the past year and reiterated the Chinese people's determination to liberate all of China's territory. Regarding the future of Sino-British relations, he pointed out: "If there is no obstruction from American imperialists and elements of British imperialism, Sino-British relations can be as friendly as China's relations with other countries that have established diplomatic relations. In the future, as long as the British government accepts the opinions and demands of the British people and expresses friendliness towards China in action, that is, completely severing diplomatic relations with the Chinese Kuomintang reactionaries, the desire to establish normal diplomatic relations between the two countries can be realized, and trade and relations in many other areas will develop further as a result."
　　
Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and member of the Chinese People's Delegation, paid tribute to British women on behalf of Chinese sisters in her speech. She introduced to the conference the great strength and creativity shown by women in the new China, who have gained true freedom and equality, in the current work of building the motherland.
　　
President of the Sino-British Friendship Association, Mr. 伊勒贝, emphasized when introducing the Chinese representatives that the friendship between China and Britain will promote trade and understanding between the two countries and will make a great contribution to world peace.
　　
Dr. Joseph Needham, professor of biochemistry at Cambridge University, who was president of the Sino-British Science Cooperation Office in Chongqing from 1942 to 1946, emphasized that the idea that Europeans can handle Asian affairs better than Asians themselves is no longer accepted by the Asian people. His words were met with warm applause. The audience also responded with warm applause to his call to allow the new China to obtain its due position in the United Nations.
　　
At the meeting, Liu Ningyi, head of the Chinese People's Delegation, presented the film "Daughters of China" and many records, as well as two satin banners embroidered with portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, to the Sino-British Friendship Association. The conference finally unanimously adopted a congratulatory telegram to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: Mr. 伊勒贝, Chairman of the Sino-British Friendship Association, sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong congratulating China's National Day. The telegram reads as follows: Chairman of the Central People's Government, Beijing:
　　
On the occasion of the National Day of the People's Republic of China, the great London demonstration, attended by the Chinese delegation led by Liu Ningyi, extends warm congratulations to you and all your people, hoping for the complete success of China's efforts for liberation and rejuvenation. Long live the friendship between the Chinese people and the British people, long live world peace!

　　英中友协庆祝我国庆
    伦敦二千人参加盛大庆祝会中国人民代表团受热烈欢迎
    【新华社布拉格三日电】伦敦讯：英中友好协会于十月一日在伦敦圣潘克拉斯市议厅举行了庆祝中华人民共和国首届国庆节的盛大集会。出席大会的英国人民近两千人。以中华全国总工会副主席刘宁一为首的中国人民代表团受到热烈友好的欢迎。
    大会收到大不列颠爱尔兰教会会议负责人迪克逊牧师与工党议员炳恩等的贺电。迪克逊牧师对于在中央人民政府领导下的中国人民所获得的进展备致赞扬；他代表英国及爱尔兰的基督教徒向中国人民致敬。
    大会始终在热情洋溢的气氛中进行，特别是在大会主要的讲演人中国人民代表团团长刘宁一演说时，掌声象暴风雨一样久久不绝。刘宁一在演说中历述中华人民共和国一年以来的成就，并重申中国人民解放全中国领土的决心。关于中英两国邦交的前途，他指出：“如果没有美国帝国主义和英国帝国主义分子的阻挠，中英邦交是可以和中国与其他已建立外交关系的国家一般友好的。今后只要英国政府接受英国人民的意见和要求，对中国在行动上表示友好，亦即是完全断绝和中国国民党反动派的外交关系，则两国之间建立正常外交关系的愿望即可实现，而通商及其许多方面的关系，定将因此有进一步的发展。”
    中国人民代表团团员、中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席李德全在演说中代表中国姊妹向英国妇女致敬。她向大会介绍了获得真正的自由和平等的新中国妇女在当前建设祖国的工作中所表现出来的伟大力量和创造性。
    英中友好协会会长伊勒贝在介绍中国代表时着重指出：英中两国的友谊将促进两国的贸易和了解，并将大有贡献于世界和平。
    曾于一九四二至一九四六年在重庆任中英科学协会会长的剑桥大学生物化学教授李约瑟博士强调指出：欧洲人比亚洲人自己会更好地处理亚洲事务的思想已不为亚洲人民所接受了。他的话博得了热烈的掌声。会众也以热烈的掌声来回答他要求允许新中国在联合国中取得应得的地位的号召。
    会上，中国人民代表团团长刘宁一将带来的影片《中华女儿》和许多唱片以及两面绣着毛主席和朱总司令肖像的缎旗赠给英中友好协会。大会最后一致通过了致中华人民共和国中央人民政府的贺电。
    【新华社三日讯】英中友好协会主席伊勒贝先生，致电毛泽东主席，祝贺我国国庆，电文如下：北京中央人民政府主席：
    当此中华人民共和国国庆之际，由刘宁一率领的中国代表团所参加的伟大的伦敦示威大会谨向您和您的全体人民致以热烈的祝贺，希望中国的解放和复兴的努力完全成功。中国人民与英国人民之间的友谊万岁，世界和平万岁！
    英中友好协会主席伊勒贝
