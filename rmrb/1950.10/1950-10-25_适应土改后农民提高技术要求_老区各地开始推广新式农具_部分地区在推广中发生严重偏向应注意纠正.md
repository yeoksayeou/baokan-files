To Meet the Technical Requirements of Farmers After Land Reform
Old Liberated Areas Begin to Promote New Farm Tools
Serious Deviations Occurring in Some Areas During Promotion Should Be Corrected

[Our Newspaper News] Reporter Lin Hong reports: Raising agricultural production technology is an urgent demand of the vast number of farmers after land reform. The work of promoting new farm tools, which began in 1950, has achieved considerable success and experience in various regions. Due to the different conditions inside and outside the customs (i.e., North China vs. Northeast China), different approaches have been adopted in the promotion of new farm tools. The Northeast region was liberated earlier, and the purchasing power of the rural areas after land reform has increased significantly. The industry is relatively developed, the land is vast and the population is sparse, and there is a lack of labor. During the puppet Manchukuo period, some areas already had the habit of using new farm tools. Last year, under the promotion of the People's Government, various places have focused on promoting more than 2,600 new farm tools. Therefore, the policy for promoting new farm tools in Northeast China this year is: actively promote improved farm tools, and focus on the trial use of Soviet-style new horse-drawn farm tools.

Because the reform of farm tools is a very important matter, the Northeast People's Government has instructed all localities to take steady steps and only manufacture and promote what they are confident of. In the past six months, the Northeast Agricultural and Forestry Department and the agricultural and forestry departments of various provinces have manufactured more than 59,300 improved farm tools, of which more than 47,600 have been issued to various places through agricultural loans from local banks or purchased and customized by local cooperatives and sold directly to farmers. All Soviet horse-drawn new farm tools are ordered from the Soviet Union and are mainly used in state-owned farms and agricultural experiment stations. Cooperatives with a better foundation also pilot-run farm tool stations and rent them to farmers at low prices. The Northeast Agricultural and Forestry Department and the agricultural and forestry departments of various provinces have also selected more than 40 mutual aid groups with a better foundation in various places and lent them a complete set of new Soviet horse-drawn farm tools for trial use. The farmers have responded well, believing that the farm tools themselves have no shortcomings, but mainly lack the technology to use them and the ability to afford them. However, the feedback on the improved farm tools manufactured in Northeast China is inconsistent. Generally speaking, the European-style plow-type farm tools in the improved farm tools are easy to use, and farmers still like to use them, only some parts are of poor quality; the improved cultivator-type farm tools are basically easy to use, but there are still shortcomings in the structure. If they can better take care of the different farming conditions in various places in the future and make slight improvements, they are still good farm tools. As a result of the use of the above three types of farm tools, the rural areas of Northeast China have played a considerably good role in improving production efficiency, improving farming methods, and saving manpower and animal power. For example, many mutual aid groups in North Manchuria have exceeded their task of reclaiming wasteland due to the use of European-style plows. Mutual aid groups using cultivator-type machines have increased the number of cultivations, achieving four cultivations and four passes.

However, due to the failure of some areas to earnestly implement the instructions of the Northeast People's Government on the promotion of new farm tools, rather serious mistakes have occurred, mainly crude manufacturing and random promotion. The high-crop weeding and earthing-up plow manufactured by the Jilin Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry is a typical example. This farm tool was still easy to use last year, but this year, because the appearance was changed casually, it was manufactured in large quantities without testing or approval (a total of more than 17,000 units were manufactured, costing 60 billion Northeast currency); when receiving the goods, they did not find someone who really understood the technology to conduct strict finished product inspection, resulting in the inability to use it at all after promotion, causing great political and economic losses to the People's Government. Secondly, the improved harrow-type farm tools have great shortcomings in structure and manufacturing quality, and it is also not appropriate to promote them in areas with great regional differences.

After discovering the above errors, the Northeast Agricultural and Forestry Department has taken active remedial measures. The high-crop weeding and earthing-up plow and other unsuitable improved farm tools that have been issued must be taken back by the original agency, and those that have not been issued will no longer be issued. Those damaged due to poor quality will be repaired by the provinces that manufactured them. Structural problems that need to be modified must be researched, tested and approved. Repair costs are not added to the price of the farm tools. In July of this year, the Northeast Agricultural and Forestry Department convened a meeting on the promotion of agricultural technology, seriously reviewed the achievements and shortcomings of the farm tool promotion work, and decided that the principle of "less but better" and "centralized promotion and use" should be adopted in the future. According to the feedback from farmers and the preliminary decisions made in the meeting, the improved farm tools to be promoted in the future will mainly be European-style plow-type and cultivator-type machines; Soviet horse-drawn new farm tools will continue to be used as a priority next year, and preparations will be made to order another batch, focusing on promotion through farm tool stations. At the same time, it is also clearly stipulated that in the future, a strict appraisal and inspection system must be established for the promotion of farm tools, and various newly designed farm tools must be approved by the Northeast Agricultural and Forestry Department before they can be manufactured and promoted.

In the areas inside the customs that have undergone land reform, since there is no experience in using new farm tools, the policy for promoting farm tools this year is: mainly supplement old farm tools, and focus on promoting the trial use of new horse-drawn farm tools. Since March of this year, the Agricultural Machinery Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has assisted in establishing 44 new farm tool stations in Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi, Chahar, Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, and the suburbs of Beijing. The design, manufacture, technical guidance, and overall management of the promotion work of new farm tools are the responsibility of the Agricultural Machinery Bureau, and the local promotion stations are responsible for on-site promotion and trial use. The three stations in the suburbs of Beijing are directly led by the Agricultural Machinery Bureau. As of now, the Agricultural Machinery Bureau has issued more than 8,700 pieces of new farm tools of various sizes to various stations; the new farm tool technician training class organized by the bureau has trained approximately 90 technicians for various places. The fourth training class is currently being prepared. Several major farm tools that have been issued, such as the wooden shaft seven-inch step plow, clay step plow, five-inch step plow, small corn threshing machine and rice threshing machine, have been researched and modified based on the opinions reflected by farmers after six months of promotion and trial use in various places. The farmers have responded well, believing that it is a great improvement compared to the original iron shaft seven-inch step plow. Various places have requested to increase the number of farm tools to be issued. However, because the promotion of new farm tools inside the customs is still in the trial production and trial use stage, the purpose is to accumulate experience and cultivate cadres. At the same time, the farm tools themselves cannot be universally welcomed by the masses, and apart from issuing a portion based on the different conditions of each station, there are no plans to promote them in large quantities.

This year, the promotion work of new farm tools inside the customs has basically not experienced major deviations because the Agricultural Machinery Bureau has adopted an extremely cautious attitude. Only some areas, such as Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi, have insufficient understanding of the importance of new farm tools and the arduous development process that it must go through, and the leadership has not paid enough attention, and the work of the farm tool stations has been slow to develop in the first half of the year. However, after repeated supervision and inspection by the Agricultural Machinery Bureau, this phenomenon has gradually changed.

　　适应土改后农民提高技术要求
    老区各地开始推广新式农具
    部分地区在推广中发生严重偏向应注意纠正
    【本报讯】记者林洪报道：提高农业生产技术，是土改后广大农民的迫切要求。一九五○年开始的推广新式农具工作，已在各地取得相当成绩和经验。由于关内和关外的条件不同，在新农具的推广上采取了不同方针。东北区全部解放的时间较早，土改后农村购买力已显著提高，工业比较发达，地广人稀劳力缺乏，伪满时期部分地区已有使用新农具习惯，去年在人民政府的提倡下，各地已有重点地推广了新农具二千六百多台。因此，今年东北推广新农具的方针是：积极推广改良农具，重点试用苏联新式马拉农具。
    因为农具的改革，是一件十分重大的事情。东北人民政府曾指示各地，必须采取稳重步骤，确有把握的才可以制造推广。半年来，东北农林部和各省农林厅，共制造改良农具五万九千三百多台，已先后发给各地出贷的有四万七千六百多台，均由各地银行通过农业贷款方式发放给农民，或由各地合作社采购订制，直接卖给农民。苏联马拉新式农具全部是向苏联订购的，主要在各公营农场和农事试验场试用。基础较好的合作社亦试办农具站，低价出租给农民使用。东北农林部和各省农林厅，并在各地有重点地选择了四十多个基础较好的互助组，贷予全套新式苏联马拉农具进行试用。农民反映良好，认为农具本身无缺点，主要是使用技术和负担能力缺乏。但对东北制造的改良农具，反映则不一致。一般说来，改良农具中的洋犁类农具好使，仅某些部分质量不好，农民还喜欢使用；铲趟机类的改良农具基本上好使，不过构造上还有缺点，今后若能更好地照顾各地不同的耕作条件，略加改造，仍不失为一种好农具。东北各地农村由于使用上述三类农具的结果，在提高生产效率，改进耕作方法和节省人畜力上，已起了相当良好的作用。如北满不少互助组，由于使用洋犁，开荒超过了任务。用铲趟机的互助组，增多了铲趟遍数，作到四铲四趟。
    但是，由于部分地区未能认真执行东北人民政府关于推广新式农具的指示，发生了相当严重的错误，主要是粗制滥造，随便推广。吉林省农林厅所制造的高作除草培土犁就是一个典型例子。这种农具去年还好使，今年因为随便改了样子，未经试验，未经批准，就大量制造（共制造一万七千多台，用去东北币六百亿元）；收货时，也没有找真正懂得技术的人，进行严格的成品检验，结果推广下去根本不能使用，使人民政府在政治上和经济上均受到很大损失。其次?耙一类的改良农具在构造和制造质量上都有很大缺点，而且有很大的地域性也是不应该推广的。
    东北农林部发现上述错误后，已采取积极补救办法。高作除草培土犁及其他不适用的改良农具，已发下者须由原机关负责收回，未发者不再发。因质量不好而损坏者，各省制造的由各省修理。构造上有毛病需要修改的，必须经过研究试验和检定批准。修理费均不加在农具价格上。今年七月东北农林部曾召开农业技术推广会议，认真地检讨了农具推广工作的成绩和缺点，决定今后应采取“少而精”和“集中推广使用”的原则。根据农民的反映，和会议中的研究初步决定，今后推广的改良农具以洋犁类和铲趟机类为主；苏联马拉新式农具，明年仍继续重点使用，准备再订购一部分，着重通过农具站推广。同时并明确规定，今后在农具的推广上，要建立严格的鉴定与检验制度，各种新设计的农具，必须经东北农林部批准才能制造推广。
    关内经过土改地区，因尚无使用新式农具经验，今年推广农具的方针是：主要补充旧农具，重点推广试用新式马拉农具。今年三月以来，中央人民政府农业部农业器械局、已协助河北、平原、山西、察哈尔、河南、山东、陕西和京郊建立起新式农具站四十四个。新农具的设计、制造、技术指导和整个推广工作的掌握，由农业器械局负责，各地推广站担负实地推广试用。京郊三站，由农业器械局直接领导。截至目前止，农业器械局已发给各站大小新农具八千七百余件；该局主办的新式农具技术人员训练班，并已代各地训练了约九十名技术人员。现正准备举办第四期训练班。已发下的几种主要农具，如木辕七寸步犁、粘土步犁，五寸步犁、小型玉米脱粒机和打稻机，是根据各地半年推广试用后农民所反映的意见，加以研究改造而成的。农民反映良好，认为较原来的铁辕七寸步犁已有很大进步。各地纷纷请求增加应发农具数目。但因关内新农具的推广，还在试制试用阶段，目的在积累经验，培养干部，同时农具本身还不能受到群众普遍的欢迎，除根据各站不同情况补发一部分外，还不拟大量推广。
    今年关内新农具的推广工作，正由于农业器械局采取了极为慎重的态度，基本上没有发生大的偏差。只有部分地区如河北、山东和山西，对新农具的重要性和它必经的艰苦发展过程认识不足，领导上不够重视，上半年农具站的工作开展较慢。但经农业器械局一再督促检查，此种现象已逐渐改变。
