　　Indestructible Force
　　Feng Ding

　　The China Peace Committee has been established for a year now. Over the past year, the Chinese people have become more aware of the opposition between the world peace camp and the aggression camp, and have become more aware of the need to "lean to one side" towards the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union. The Chinese people believe in the magnificent strength of the world peace camp, and have determination, courage, and resolve in the struggle against the expansion of aggression and the expansion of war by US imperialism, because the Chinese people have liberated themselves by contributing their strength in a long struggle. The Chinese people have not only signed the peace declaration in the millions, but also understand that in the elimination of bandits, special agents, and feudal forces, in the restoration of construction and the development of production, even the slightest achievement increases the strength of the world's defense of peace. Therefore, the Chinese people are actively suppressing bandits and preventing special agents, increasing production, building dikes to eliminate pests, building water conservancy projects, preparing to liberate Taiwan, and striving to support the front lines. Many young people are even requesting to join the army. In short, the Chinese people are defending world peace with signatures and all kinds of practical actions, so the strength here will be inexhaustible, and indestructible.

　　不可摧毁的力量
    冯定
    中国保卫世界和平大会的成立已经一周年了。一年来，中国人民更认识了世界和平阵营与侵略阵营的对立，更认识了必须“一边倒”向以苏联为首的和平阵营的道理。中国人民相信世界和平阵营的雄伟力量，在反对美帝国主义扩大侵略扩大战争的斗争中有决意、勇气和决心，因为中国人民正是在长久的斗争中贡献了自己的力量而获得解放的。中国人民不仅成千成万在和平宣言书上签了名，而且也懂得自己在肃清匪特与封建主义的特殊势力中，在恢复建设与发展生产中，只要有一点一滴的成就，就是增加了全世界保卫和平的力量，所以中国人民积极剿匪防特，增加生产，筑堤除虫，兴修水利，准备解放台湾，努力支前，不少青年还在要求参军。总而言之，中国人民是拿签名与各种各样的实际行动来保卫世界和平的，因而这里的力量将取之不尽，用之不竭，而且不可摧毁。
