　　Pingyuan Province, Yanggu County, Fourth District
    Neglects Epidemic Incident
    County Government Letter Conducts Self-Criticism
    To the Editor:
    After the People's Garden published the letter from comrades Zhao Xiaoting and Li Zhijing of the Health Section of the Liaocheng Prefectural Office on August 27, criticizing the Yanggu Fourth District Government for neglecting the serious epidemic in the area, we conducted an inspection. We are now reporting our inspection process and self-criticism to you. Why was the prevention work in the Fourth District not done well? The main reason is due to the bureaucratic work style of the county leadership. The county government only made general arrangements for summer epidemic prevention work and did not conduct timely inspections. After we received the epidemic report from the Fourth District, we only sent doctors for treatment and did not instruct the district to take specific and effective measures; at the same time, we did not even know that the epidemic had been going on for so long and that so many children had died.
    However, Comrade Zhang Ruixin, the district chief of the Fourth District, and Comrade Mao Zhendai, the assistant in charge of culture and education and health, adopted an indifferent attitude after discovering the epidemic. They neither immediately organized the masses to find ways to prevent and eliminate the epidemic, nor did they report to the county government to request instructions (the county government stipulates that epidemics must be reported to the county government); moreover, when the county sent doctors to carry out epidemic prevention and treatment, they used the excuse of being busy to shirk the responsibility of eliminating and preventing the epidemic. In addition to ordering the two comrades to make profound self-criticisms (their self-reflection materials have been submitted to the county), the county government has decided to give Comrades Zhang Ruixin and Mao Zhendai a demerit of one level each.

　　平原省阳谷县四区
    忽视疫症事件
    该县县府来信检讨编辑同志：
    八月二十七日人民园地刊登了聊城专署卫生科赵晓庭、李志竞二同志批评阳谷四区区政府忽视当地严重疫情的信以后，我们曾进行了检查。现把我们的检查经过及检讨告诉你们。四区的预防工作为什么没有作好呢？主要原因是由于县领导上的官僚主义作风。县府对于夏季防疫工作只作了一般布置，没有进行及时检查。在我们接到四区的疫情报告以后，只派医生前往治疗，未指示区作具体有效的措施；同时，我们竟还不知道疫症发生已这么久，儿童病死这么多。
    而四区区长张瑞信同志及文教兼卫生助理员茅镇岱同志，在发现疫情以后，竟采取漠不关心的态度。既不立即组织群众设法防疫灭疫，又不报告县府，请示办法（县府规定有疫情须向县府回报）；而且当县派医生前往进行防疫治疗时，竟借口工作忙来推卸灭疫防疫的责任。县府除令该二同志做深刻检讨外（现他们的反省材料已交县），并决定给张瑞信、茅镇岱二同志以各记大过一次处分。
