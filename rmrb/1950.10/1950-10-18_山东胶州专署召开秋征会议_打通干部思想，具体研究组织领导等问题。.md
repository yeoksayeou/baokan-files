　　Jiaozhou Prefecture, Shandong Province, Holds Autumn Grain Collection Conference
    Unifying Cadres' Thinking and Studying Organizational Leadership and Other Issues

    [Our Newspaper] The Jiaozhou Prefectural Office of Shandong Province convened an autumn grain collection conference to unify the thinking of cadres and deploy the autumn agricultural tax collection work; it also specifically studied organizational leadership and other issues. The conference opened on September 14th, lasted six days, and ended on the 20th. After studying documents, listening to reports from responsible comrades, and engaging in group discussions, the representatives unanimously recognized that this year's autumn grain collection is being carried out under the principle of consolidating the balance of financial revenue and expenditure and moderately reducing the people's burden. Completing the autumn grain collection task is of great significance for consolidating the hard-won victories and achievements in financial and economic work. Therefore, it shattered the "one-sided" thinking of some cadres who believed that the burden should be further reduced under the central government's established tax rate. The representatives also realized that with land reform imminent, the timely and smooth completion of the autumn grain collection would create favorable conditions for land reform; failure to do so would add trouble to land reform and put the work in a passive position.

    When the conference discussed how to implement organizational leadership to complete the autumn grain collection task, everyone agreed that although this year's autumn grain collection has favorable conditions such as a better harvest, improved ideological awareness of cadres and the masses, experience in summer grain collection, and unified tax laws, due to the heavy autumn grain collection task, short time frame, and passive thinking of cadres and the masses, some cadres once showed negative emotions and a lack of confidence. They were afraid that the party and government departments would be unable to manage the task and demanded that the task be pushed to the business departments to complete. After the leaders repeatedly explained: "The autumn grain collection work is an important task in the central work of the autumn season. It must be completed in a concentrated manner in October to smoothly promote land reform. As long as leading cadres at all levels take the initiative, there is no problem in completing the task." Finally, everyone unanimously recognized that it is necessary to strengthen organizational strength and complete the task in a concentrated manner; the business departments must strengthen business work and, in addition to giving full play to the work enthusiasm of business cadres, should also strengthen the leadership of tax assistance personnel.

    The conference further studied land yield per mu, relieving cadres of their "task" burden. In the initial calculations, everyone felt that this year's autumn grain collection was not only not reduced compared to last year, but had actually increased. Therefore, they were burdened with the "task," thinking that when they went down to publicize, the antagonistic thinking of cadres and the masses toward the task would be impossible to reverse. They all complained that the higher-ups had not foreseen this and should not have put all the year's reductions in the summer season; it would have been better to reduce the tax in two seasons. Finally, under the leadership of Xin, the deputy commissioner of the district, everyone gradually realized through discussions that the entire country and the entire province had been reduced considerably. Because Jiaozhou area has a lower land grade than other areas, in order to make up for the shortcomings of high and low land grades, we should adjust the burden from the actual situation and correctly implement the spirit of the central government's burden policy. Then, they analyzed the annual collection situation, pointing out that the summer burden is part of the annual burden. In order to take care of this spring's disasters, the higher authorities reduced the burden more in the summer. The absolute number of this year's autumn grain collection is not reduced compared to last year, but because this year is a better harvest and the masses have more income, it is still reduced from a relative numerical point of view. In order to consolidate the hard-won victory in financial and economic work and strive for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation, the burden on the masses cannot be excessively reduced at present.

    On the basis of everyone's ideological improvement, the conference also studied the autumn grain collection arrangements and organizational leadership and other issues. In the end, everyone was extremely confident and determined to implement the policies and complete the task.

　　山东胶州专署召开秋征会议
    打通干部思想，具体研究组织领导等问题。
    【本报讯】山东省胶州专署召开秋征会议，打通干部思想，布置秋季农业税征收工作；并具体研究了组织领导等问题。会议于九月十四日召开，历时六天，于二十日结束。代表们在会议中经过学习文件，听取负责同志报告并展开小组讨论后，一致认识到了今年秋征是在巩固财政收支平衡，酌量减轻民负的方针下进行的，完成秋征任务具有巩固财经工作既得胜利与成绩的重要意义。因此，打破了某些干部认为要在中央既定的税率下再行减轻负担的“片面”思想；代表们同时认识到土改在即，秋征如能按时顺利完成，将给土改创造有利条件；成之，将给土改增加麻烦，使工作陷入被动。
    会议研究如何实行组织领导完成秋征任务时，大家都认为今年秋征虽有年成较好、干群思想觉悟提高、有夏征工作经验及统一的税法等有利条件，但由于秋征任务繁重，时间短促，干群思想被动，结果，某些干部曾一度表现了情绪消极，信心不强，害怕党政部门无力掌握，要求把任务推给业务部门去完成。后经领导者一再说明：“秋征工作为秋季中心工作中一项重要任务，必须于十月份突击完成，以便顺利推行土改，各级领导干部只要亲自动手，完成任务是没有问题的。”最后大家一致认识到必须加强组织力量，突击完成任务；而业务部门必须加强业务工作，除了发挥业务干部的工作积极性外，并应加强助征人员的领导。
    会议还进一步研究了地亩产量，解除了干部们的“任务”包袱。在初步算账时，大家都感到今年秋征比去年不但没减轻，反而加重了，因此就背上了“任务”包袱，以为下去宣传时，干群对任务的对抗思想是无法扭转的，都埋怨上级没有预见，不应把全年减轻数都放在夏季，如分两季减轻征就好了。最后，经该区辛副专员领导大家座谈，才逐渐认识到全国与全省都减轻不少。胶州地区因地级较其他地区低，为了弥补地级高低的缺陷，就应当从实际出发调整负担，正确贯彻中央负担政策精神。接着又分析了全年征收情况，指出夏季负担为全年负担的一部分，上级为了照顾今春灾荒，故夏季减轻较多。今年秋征绝对数字与去年比较并未减轻，但因今年较为丰收，群众收入多，从相对数字看来还是减轻了。为了巩固财经工作既得的胜利，争取国家财经情况的根本好转，群众负担目前还是不能过分减轻的。
    会议在大家思想提高的基础上，又研究了秋征布置与组织领导等问题。最后大家信心极高，决心执行政策完成任务。
