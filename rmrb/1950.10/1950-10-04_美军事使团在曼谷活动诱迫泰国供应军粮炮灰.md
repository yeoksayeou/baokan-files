　　美军事使团在曼谷活动诱迫泰国供应军粮炮灰
    【新华社一日讯】据《南侨日报》曼谷消息：美国梅尔拜军事使团于八月二十六日至本月十六日在泰国进行侵略活动期间，不但已向泰国提出“共同使用”泰国海陆空军基地的要求，而且已进一步要求泰国须负担东南亚的美属军队的军粮。
    据该报引曼谷消息灵通人士透露：美国军事使团在与泰方军事代表举行秘密会议时，要求泰国在东南亚进入战争状态时，以军粮供给美国侵略军队或美国所指挥的军队。銮披汶政府已表示“接受考虑，并将尽可能给予美国以便利”。
    美国军事使团在泰国活动期间，并为美国侵略朝鲜征募炮灰。泰国国务院秘书长蒙銮确于五日对记者谈美军事使团在泰国“调查”的情况时宣称：“泰国决定再派现役兵一旅往朝鲜，这是以前决定派志愿兵一混合队以外的军队。”
