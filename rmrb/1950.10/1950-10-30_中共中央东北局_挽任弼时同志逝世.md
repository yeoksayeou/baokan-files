Condolences on the Passing of Comrade Ren Bishi

Respected Comrade Bishi:

Your passing has deprived our Party of an outstanding leader, and the Chinese people of a great fighter and mentor. This is a tremendous loss for the Party and the people!

We deeply mourn you. All Communists in Northeast China will surely learn from you even better, and at the same time resolutely work a hundred times harder to oppose the aggression of American imperialism, consolidate national defense, and continue to develop economic construction!

Respected Comrade Bishi, your immortal spirit is inspiring us. We will definitely overcome any difficulties, forge ahead bravely, and complete the cause you left unfinished.

Respectfully,

The CCP Central Committee Northeast Bureau
