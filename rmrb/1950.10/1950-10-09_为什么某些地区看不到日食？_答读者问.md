　　Why Can't Some Regions See Solar Eclipses?
    Answers to Readers' Questions
    After the publication of the news about the solar eclipse on September 12th in this newspaper, many readers wrote to inquire why they could not see the solar eclipse in their area. We have now specially asked the Popular Astronomy Society to explain as follows.
    Editor
    We all know that a solar eclipse occurs when the moon obscures the sun; we also know that the moon and the earth both trail long shadows behind them. During a total solar eclipse, not every place on Earth can see the total eclipse. Only people along the line where the tip of the moon's shadow sweeps across the ground can see the total solar eclipse. This line is actually an area averaging about 270 kilometers wide. This area is called the path of totality. People outside the path of totality cannot see the total eclipse, only those within a considerable range in the penumbra of the moon's shadow can see a partial solar eclipse (approximately within 3,500 kilometers on both sides of the centerline). The farther away from the centerline, the smaller the visible portion of the partial eclipse.
    This time (September 12th), the path of totality of the total solar eclipse only passed through the far eastern part of Siberia in the Soviet Union. The southern boundary line of this solar eclipse is about 4,000 kilometers away from the centerline, so some areas in northeastern China could see more or less of a partial solar eclipse. This boundary line passes through Gui Sui, Datong, northeast of Zhengding, Dezhou, northeast of Jinan to the northeast of the East China Sea (map omitted). Partial eclipses were visible in the northeastern part of this line. For example, in the northeasternmost Jiamusi, 42% of the eclipse was visible; Beijing is farther from the centerline than Jiamusi, so only 6% of the eclipse could be seen. The closer to the boundary line, the smaller the portion of the eclipse seen. As for places outside the boundary line, such as Shijiazhuang and Jinan, they could not see any partial eclipse at all. Some comrades in some places were very enthusiastic about observing, but did not see the solar eclipse phenomenon because they were outside the boundary line. Some people said that the partial eclipse seen in Beijing was too small and not satisfying enough, which is also because it was far from the centerline.

　　为什么某些地区看不到日食？
    答读者问
    九月十二日本报发表关于日食的消息以后，许多读者来信，询问为什么他们那里看不到日食。现特请大众天文社解释如下。
    编者
    我们都知道日食的发生是月亮把太阳遮蔽的现象；我们也知道月亮和地球后面都拖着一条长的影子。日全食时，在地球上并不是任何地方都能看见全食的，而只有在月影尖端扫过地面的一条线上的人才能看到日全食。该线实际上是平均约二百七十公里宽的地带。这地带叫做全食带。在全食带外的人是不能看见全食的，只有在相当范围以内处于月影的半影中间的地方，才可看见日偏食（大约在中心线两侧三千五百公里以内）。离开中心线愈远的地方，可以看见偏食的成份也愈小。
    这次（九月十二日）的日全食，全食带经过陆地的，只有苏联西伯利亚的极东部。这次日食的南界线距离中心线约四千多公里，所以我国东北部分的地带可以看到或多或少的日偏食。这条界线系经过归绥、大同、正定东北、德州、济南东北至东海东北入海（图略）。在这条线东北的部分，都可见到偏食。例如最东北的佳木斯可见到百分之四十二的偏食；北京离中心线比佳木斯远，所以只能见到百分之六的偏食。愈近界线的地方，所见到的偏食成份也愈小。至于在界线以外的地方，如石家庄、济南等处，就根本看不到偏食。有些地方的同志们很热心观测，但并没有看到日食现象，就是因为在界线以外。有人说，在北京看到的偏食过小，很不够味，这也是因为离开中心线远的关系。
