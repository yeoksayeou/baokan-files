　　Matthiessen was one of the most outstanding and rarest scholars of bourgeois literature and art in the United States. Recently, I suddenly heard that he had died in March of this year, and that he had committed suicide by jumping from a high floor of a hotel in Boston!

　　This news moved me and filled me with anger. Another conscientious and honest person has been sacrificed under the inhumane war policy of American imperialism. His death specifically symbolizes the feeble resistance of the American bourgeois democratic tradition to imperialist rule, while also demonstrating the emptiness and impending death of that tradition.

　　I met Matthiessen in the winter of 1944. One evening in Boston, I was invited to attend an expanded meeting of a subcommittee of the Political Action Committee of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). The main topic of the meeting was to discuss the establishment of a CIO Political Action Committee branch at Harvard University. At that time, the CIO was still quite progressive. Most of the professors present expressed doubt and hesitation about organizing a branch, stammering that they were afraid of being "used" by the communists, and some even shamefully admitted their weakness and timidity. At that moment, a short, stout man stood up from the corner of the room, his face tense, and emphatically argued for the need for such a branch. He criticized his colleagues a lot, pointing out that their reluctance to join the union was a prejudice, and that their unwillingness to organize a CIO Political Action Committee branch was a hesitant and irresponsible attitude. I paid close attention to this person at the time, but it was not until 1945, when I took his course, that I realized that this short, stout man was Professor Matthiessen, who was deeply admired by Harvard students.

　　After becoming acquainted with Matthiessen, I learned about his views on literature and art. His idealistic starting point was inconsistent with his demands for political action. However, he had a good understanding of and sympathy for the general direction of the Chinese question. In a debate about idealistic literary and artistic thought and realistic literary theory, I spoke about the actual situation and significance of the combination of Chinese literature and art with the people. He seemed quite touched, thought about coming to China to see for himself, and discussed some ways to make it possible for him to come to China. I knew that at the time, Matthiessen had this idea because he wanted to see new things. Unfortunately, none of the plans succeeded. A few months later, I left Harvard and didn't know much about this gentleman's situation.

　　In the winter of 1948, I happened to read an article by Matthiessen in Hong Kong, which revealed that he had not been able to come to China but had gone to Eastern Europe and taught in Czechoslovakia. The article was published after the revolutionary coup in Czechoslovakia, and quoted letters from Czech students in defense of revolutionary Czechoslovakia. Until recently, I learned indirectly from a book review that he had committed suicide by jumping from a building. After that, I read articles commemorating him in the magazine *Masses & Mainstream*, and learned that Matthiessen had long been fiercely attacked by the American imperialist literary and art beggars and Trotskyist hooligans. A book he wrote about the new democratic countries, *From the Heart of Europe*, was shamelessly slandered by the American imperialist literary and art jackals. He also suffered various subtle persecutions at Harvard. But Matthiessen ignored these things. He resolutely stood with the people in the American peace camp, actively participated in the Progressive Party, and attended the peace conference held in New York last year, sharply rebuking those saboteurs who deliberately disrupted Fadeyev's speech in the conference hall.

　　Such a person committed suicide. Why?

　　Usually, we easily attribute suicide to the weakness of the suicide victim. In one sense, this statement is correct. Especially when progressive forces are engaged in a life-and-death struggle with reactionary forces, an individual who basically belongs to the progressive forces may be unable to endure the oppression of the reactionary forces, or may experience ideological contradictions due to the intensity of the struggle, the uncertainty of victory or defeat, and the unclear future situation, and then decide to resolve everything through death. This kind of thing is always a manifestation of weakness. However, simply explaining the reason why that individual did not want to live from personal factors is not enough to explain anything. Especially in the case of Matthiessen, who was essentially an excellent inheritor of American bourgeois democratic thought. He died because in the cruel class struggle, he failed to acquire the ideological content of class struggle and also lost his former spiritual basis.

　　Americans call their tradition of bourgeois democratic thought the Jeffersonian tradition. This tradition is expressed in literature and art in the works of Emerson, Melville, Thoreau, and Whitman. Some of these people emphasized spirituality and opposed any pressure, such as Emerson and Thoreau; some emphasized the individual's resistance to oppressive forces but opposed collective action, such as Thoreau; some emphasized adapting to people and times and opposed arbitrariness and autocracy, such as Melville. Whitman had a broad people's perspective, a cloud-like liberalism, and unreservedly threw himself into the war against slavery without the slightest retreat. In a word, the individualism and liberalism that the war-mongers fostered by American monopoly capital today sing loudly in order to deceive the relatively backward people are originally the bourgeois traditional things that were emphasized and promoted by the aforementioned people. These things played a good role at the time. Matthiessen devoted his life to the study of English and American literature, especially American literature, and he was a spiritual son of these people. He believed that the value viewpoints of artists and the value viewpoints of monopoly capital were in conflict, but he did not know that the so-called value viewpoint of artists of the bourgeoisie only has an idealistic, abstract, and general content. He believed in "socialism," but the source of his socialism was the utopian socialism of 18th-century France. He acknowledged that healthy democracy depends on a progressive labor movement, but he did not recognize the historical status and worldview of the working class. He took action to protest against reactionary rule, but his starting point was an individual standpoint rather than a class standpoint, and he always wanted to maintain his personal "independence" and "freedom." In terms of literary and artistic thought, he was a dualist, believing that there was a surreal reality in addition to realism. The authors he truly loved were Eliot and Melville, authors who favored symbolism and emphasized utopianism.

　　However, due to his abhorrence of the ugliness of the bourgeoisie, especially monopoly capital, Matthiessen had begun to study some writers from a realistic perspective in his last few years. He had never greatly admired Dreiser. However, in the book *American Renaissance*, he chose Dreiser as the representative of modern literary and artistic trends. Before going to Europe, he completed the book *The James Family*, and surprisingly broke out of the so-called pure art viewpoint, seeing the process of aversion, resistance, compromise, and escape of Henry James's family towards financial capital. It should be said that before his suicide, he was moving in a progressive direction. He was a person who awakened only in the later period of the New Deal in the 1930s, and the anti-fascist war had also helped him. But he did not go fast enough, because he always refused to get rid of the bourgeois democratic tradition he had turned to, and that tradition had absolutely no power to support him in breaking through the storm of imperialist warmongers. In fact, that tradition has long been dug out of all the progressive content it had in the early stages of capitalism by the war-mongers today. Even the formal civil rights it flaunted have been deprived and turned into a deceptive tool for them to wage wars, take the wives and children of others, and plunder all the people's possessions. The progressive content of the bourgeois tradition can only be absorbed and have its meaning when a socialist society arrives. Therefore, a person who always hangs himself on that dying tradition in the current struggle cannot but be an accomplice to the imperialist murderers, whether intentionally or unintentionally; otherwise, he only has to find another way to make a stronger counterattack against imperialism. If he cannot do that, he will be as empty and suicidal as that tradition.

　　However, in terms of Matthiessen's achievements in American bourgeois literary criticism, in terms of his difficult and contradictory struggle against the evil actions of his own class, his death is a great loss to the American people. Even to a certain extent, it is also a considerable loss to the people of the world. The American imperialists, out of fear of the Soviet Union and fear of the rising tide of the just struggle of the people of the world, are frantically manufacturing wars and expanding wars externally, and preparing for atomic warfare, destroying peaceful villages in Korea with airplanes and artillery, and slaughtering peaceful residents in Korean towns and villages by the thousands, even exterminating birds. Internally, they have torn off all legal and democratic faces, using secret police and thugs to persecute, imprison, and force to death all people who dare to harbor resistance to their war policies. They imprisoned the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party, persecuted Robeson, as well as countless intellectuals and workers, and now they have forced Matthiessen to death. Even if he was a follower of the bourgeois tradition, they will persecute him to the point that he has no way to go but to commit suicide. Imperialist warmongers are destroyers of culture and enemies of mankind. No matter how their large and small propaganda machines continue to falsely accuse him, slander him, and even curse him after Matthiessen's death, his death cannot but sow seeds of anger in the hearts of many conscientious Americans. These seeds must grow and erupt with the strong development of the world people's peace movement, burying the warmongers in the flames of anger!

　　死在美国战争政策下的马蒂逊
    杨刚
    马蒂逊教授（F.O.Matthiessen）是美国资产阶级治文艺的学者中最出色也最难得的一个。最近忽然听说他在本年三月间死了，而且是从波士顿旅馆的高楼上跳下来自杀的！
    这个消息使我感动，而愤怒。又是一个有良心的诚实的人在美帝国主义灭绝了人性的战争政策之下牺牲了。他的死具体地象征了美国资产阶级民主传统对帝国主义统治的微弱的反抗，同时也表现了那个传统的空虚和邻近死亡。
    我认识马蒂逊是在一九四四年冬天。在波士顿有一个晚上，我被邀旁听美国产业工会联合会政治行动委员会的一个小组会扩大会。会上的主要议题是讨论在哈佛大学成立“产联”政治行动委员会的支会。那时的“产联”还是相当进步的。到会的一些教授们大都对组织支会表示怀疑和退缩，吞吞吐吐地表示怕被共产党“利用”，有的还羞愧地承认自己软弱畏葸。当时从屋角里站起一个身材矮胖的人，面容紧张，强调地主张需要这样一个支会。他对于他的同事们作了很多批评，指出他们不愿参加工会是一种成见，说不愿组织“产联”政治行动委员会支会是徘徊的不负责任的态度。当时我很注意这个人，但一直到一九四五我选了他的课，才知道这矮胖子就是深得哈佛学生敬仰的马蒂逊教授。
    和马蒂逊熟识了之后，知道了这人对文艺的看法，他的唯心论的出发点是和他参加政治行动的要求不相符的。但是他对于中国问题的大方向却很了解而且同情。在辩论唯心论的文艺思想和现实主义的文艺理论时，我说到中国文艺与人民结合的实际情形和意义，他好像颇有触动，想到中国来看看，并且商量了一些办法如何使他自己能来中国。我知道，当时马蒂逊是抱着想看见新鲜事物的态度而这样作想的。可惜办法都未成功。几个月后，我离开了哈佛，也就不大知道这位先生的情形了。
    一九四八年冬在香港偶然读到马蒂逊一篇文章，知道他不能来中国，却去了东欧，并在捷克教过书。那篇文章发表在捷克革命政变之后，文中引述捷克学生的来信为革命的捷克辩护。直到最近，忽然间接从一篇书评里知道他跳楼自杀了。这之后，又从《群众与主流》杂志上读到追悼他的文章，才知道马蒂逊早已被美帝国主义的大小文丐走狗和托洛斯基派流氓所猛烈攻击。他写的关于新民主主义国家的一本书《来自欧洲的心脏》遭到美帝的走狗文丐们无耻的诽谤。在哈佛也受着种种不着痕迹的迫害。但是马蒂逊不顾这些。他坚决地与美国和平阵营的人们站在一起，在进步党中积极活动，参加了去年在纽约举行的和平大会，尖锐地斥责那些在会场中故意扰乱法捷耶夫的演辞的破坏分子。
    这样一个人自杀了。他是为什么呢？
    通常我们容易把自杀归咎于自杀者的软弱。在一个意义上这种说法是对的。尤其是当进步力量与反动力量作生死斗争的时候，基本上属于进步力量的个人或由于不堪忍受反动势力的压迫，或由于斗争激烈，胜负不分，形势混乱而产生了思想矛盾，看不见前途的情况，便决心以一死来解决一切。这种事情总是软弱无力的表现，但是单纯地从个人的因素来解释那一个人不愿意活下去的原因，并不足以说明什么。尤其是如马蒂逊，本质上是美国资产阶级民主思想的优良的继承者。他死，是因为在残酷的阶级斗争中，他未能取得阶级斗争的思想内容，而又失去了他旧日的精神依据。
    美国人称他们的资产阶级民主思想的传统为杰弗生传统。这个传统表现在文艺方面的是爱默生（Emerson），梅菲尔（Melville），梭罗（Thoreau）和惠特曼这些人的著作。这些人有的强调性灵、反对任何压力，如爱默生和梭罗；有的强调个人对压迫势力的反抗斗争而反对集体行动，如梭罗；有的强调因人因时而制宜，反对专断独裁，如梅菲尔。惠特曼有广大的人民的观点，风云一样的自由主义，无保留地投身在反奴隶制度的战争中，不稍退缩。一句话，今天美国垄断资本所豢养的战争贩子为了欺骗比较落后的人民而高唱的个人主义和自由主义，原是被上述这些人所强调发扬了的资产阶级传统的东西。这些东西在当时是起过了好作用的。马蒂逊一生治英美文学，尤其是美国文学，他是这些人精神上的儿子。他相信艺术家的价值观点和垄断资本的价值观点是冲突的，却不知资产阶级的所谓艺术家的价值观点只有一个唯心的，抽象而笼统的内容。他相信“社会主义”，但是他的社会主义的来源是十八世纪法国空想的社会主义。他承认健康的民主有赖于进步的劳工运动，但是他不承认工人阶级的历史地位及其世界观。他采取了行动来对反动统治抗议，但是他的出发点是个人的立场而不是阶级的立场，他始终想保持其个人的“独立性”和“自由”。在文艺思想方面他是二元论的，认为除了现实主义之外还有一个超现实的真实。他真正心爱的作家是艾略特，是梅菲尔这些喜好象征主义重空想的作者。
    不过，由于痛恶资产阶级特别是垄断资本的丑恶，马蒂逊在最后几年曾经起始来从现实主义的观点研究一些作家。对于德莱塞他向来是不大佩服的。但是在《美国文艺复兴》那本书中却选择了德莱塞作近代文艺趋势的代表。他在去欧之前，写成了《詹姆斯家族》一书，竟然跳出了所谓纯艺术的观点，看出亨利·詹姆斯（Henry James）一家对于金融资本的厌恶，反抗，妥协逃避的过程。应该说在他自杀以前，他是朝着进步的方向走的。他是三十年代新政时期的后期才觉醒起来的人，反法西斯战争也曾经帮助过他。但是他走得不算快，因为他始终不肯摆脱他所归依的资产阶级民主主义的传统，而那个传统又已经绝对没有力量来支持他突破帝国主义战争贩子狂风暴雨的袭击。事实上，那个传统到了今天早已被战贩们挖去了其在资本主义发韧时期所有的一切进步内容，连它所标榜的形式上的民权（Civil Rights）都被剥夺，而变成了他们用来进行战争，寡人之妻，孤人之子，掠夺人民的一切据为己有的欺骗工具。资产阶级传统的进步内容只有等到社会主义社会到来时才能被吸取而发生它的意义。在目前的斗争中始终把自己挂在那个将死的传统上面的人因此就不能不是有意或无意地替帝国主义杀人犯做帮凶，否则他只有另寻道路对帝国主义作更坚强的反击。又不能如此，他就会和那个传统一样的空虚而自杀了。
    但是，就马蒂逊在美国资产阶级文学批评上的成就来讲，就他困难地矛盾地反抗其本阶级的罪恶行动的斗争来讲，他的死对于美国人民是很大的损失。甚至于在一定限度以内，对于世界人民也是有相当损失的。美帝国主义者由于害怕苏联，害怕世界人民旭日方升的正义斗争，正在对外则穷凶极恶地制造战争，扩大战争，并准备原子战争，用飞机大炮毁灭朝鲜的和平村庄，成千上万地屠杀朝鲜城镇乡村的和平居民，连飞鸟都赶尽杀绝；对内则撕破了一切法律和民主的面孔，运用特务警察和流氓来迫害，监禁，逼死一切敢于对它的战争政策心怀反抗的人民。他们监禁美共十一领袖，迫害罗伯逊，以及无数知识分子和工人，现在又逼死了马蒂逊，即使他是资产阶级传统的追随者，他们都要迫害他，以致于他走头无路而不得不自杀。帝国主义战争贩子是文化的毁灭者，是人类的公敌。不管他们的大小宣传机器在马蒂逊死后如何继续地诬告他，污蔑他，甚至于咒骂他，他的死不可能不在许多有良心的美国人心中种下愤怒的种子。这些种子一定要随着世界人民和平运动的强大发展而滋长爆发起来，将战争贩子埋葬在愤怒的火焰中的！
