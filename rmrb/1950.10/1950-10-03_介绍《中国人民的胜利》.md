　　Introducing "The Victory of the Chinese People"

    At the suggestion of Comrade Stalin, the documentary "The Victory of the Chinese People," co-produced by Soviet filmmakers led by the outstanding film director Comrade Varlamov and Chinese filmmakers, has been released in major cities.
    "The Victory of the Chinese People" is a great success both politically and artistically. The film's content is ideologically rich and has political educational significance. It demonstrates the patriotic spirit of the great Chinese people, reflecting how the brave and hardworking Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, waged a revolutionary war against imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and achieved final victory. The film depicts the profound suffering of the Chinese people under the rule of imperialism and its running dogs. From the film, we see China's vast territory, rich resources, and the magnificent ancient sites such as the Great Wall. The laboring people's work inspires patriotism and reminds us that the Chinese people are the masters of China, and China should belong to the Chinese people. However, under the rule of imperialism and its running dogs at that time, China's land did not belong to the Chinese people. The film shows houses occupied by imperialists, marked with signs saying "This house belongs to the United States" and "This house belongs to Britain." It reflects the exploitation, oppression, and massacre of the Chinese people by imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, who betrayed the country. This situation is intolerable to every Chinese person and every patriotic individual. This fully explains why the Chinese people regarded the imperialist invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang as irreconcilable enemies and why the Chinese people possessed such a strong revolutionary patriotic will. The film reflects the Chinese Communists' persistence in their glorious revolutionary struggle during China's dark era. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu joined forces in Jinggang Mountain, organized the People's Army, went through the 25,000-li Long March, led the Anti-Japanese War in Yan'an, and, during the Liberation War, shifted from defense to offense, all the way to the victory of the national revolution. The film reflects the development of the Chinese People's Liberation Army from a guerrilla force using spears and rifles to a four-million-strong army with mechanized equipment. It reflects the Chinese Communist Party's leadership of the great land reform movement among the peasants. All of these show that the victory of the Chinese people was by no means accidental, but mainly due to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. The film reflects the Chinese people's use of tunnel warfare, their enthusiastic participation in the army, the transportation of troops in wooden boats, and the support of the front lines by millions of stretcher bearers. This demonstrates the Chinese people's great creativity and that once mobilized, the Chinese people are fully confident in eliminating any aggressor who dares to attack our country. In this film, the flag of our People's Republic of China is flying high, while the Kuomintang's treasonous flag falls and the flag of the American aggressors hangs its head in shame. Tens of thousands of Beijing people enthusiastically celebrate their liberation, while the American Embassy's gates are closed in a desolate scene. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army ride American tanks and use American artillery and automatic rifles, weapons that Truman gave to Chiang Kai-shek but became our spoils of war in battle. These various depictions are enough to strengthen the people's morale and deflate the enemy's arrogance. The Soviet Red Army's liberation of Northeast China, the meeting between Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Stalin, and the Chinese people's celebration of the birthday of Comrade Stalin, the great teacher of progressive mankind worldwide, show that the Soviet Union is China's best friend. The victory of the Chinese people is the victory of Marxism-Leninism, and China's five-star flag reflects the glory of the great Russian October Revolution. This teaches us that the Chinese people's patriotism and internationalism are completely combined. The film is full of growing buds, lush green leaves, and gardens full of blooming flowers—a scene full of beautiful spring. The free Chinese people work on their own land and carry out their own industrial construction, showing the infinitely bright prospects of China's New Democratic society and the infinitely beautiful future of the Chinese people.
    This is an extremely valuable film, and we hope that young people and members of the Youth League will not only watch it but also deeply understand its meaning and widely publicize this meaning to the broad masses of the people. When carrying out patriotic and internationalist education and basic knowledge education of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the Youth League committees at all levels should use this film as a good teaching material for educating young people and members of the Youth League.

　　介绍《中国人民的胜利》
    杨述
    经斯大林同志的提议，以杰出的电影导演家瓦尔格拉莫夫同志为首的苏联电影工作者和中国电影工作者合制的《中国人民的胜利》的纪录片，已在各大城市上演了。
    《中国人民的胜利》这部影片，在政治上和艺术上都获得了很大成功。这部影片的内容是富有思想性，具有政治教育的意义的。它表现了伟大的中国人民的爱国主义精神，反映了勇敢勤劳的中国人民怎样在毛主席和中国共产党领导下，向帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮，进行革命战争并取得了最后的胜利。这部影片写出中国人民在帝国主义及其走狗统治下所受到的深重的灾难。从影片里看到中国的辽阔的疆土，丰富的资源，万里长城等雄伟的古迹，劳动人民的操作，令人油然而生爱国之思，令人想到中国人民是中国的主人，中国应该属于中国人民。但在帝国主义及其走狗统治的当时，中国的国土并不属于中国人民。影片中反映出帝国主义所霸占的房屋，标志着“此房为美国所有”“此房为英国所有”。反映出帝国主义和出卖祖国的蒋介石匪帮对中国人民的剥削，压迫，屠杀。这种情景是每一个中国人民，每一个爱国分子看到时所不能容忍的。这就是充分地说明了为什么中国人民把帝国主义侵略者和蒋介石匪帮看成不共戴天的仇敌，为什么中国人民有如此坚强的革命的爱国意志。影片中反映出中国共产党人在中国黑暗的时代坚持着光荣的革命斗争。毛主席、朱总司令在井岗山会师，组织了人民军队，经过二万五千里长征，在延安领导抗日战争，并在解放战争时期，从防御转为进攻，一直到全国革命胜利。影片反映出中国人民解放军从使用红缨枪、步枪进行游击战争的队伍，发展到有机械化装备的四百万的大军；反映出中国共产党领导农民进行伟大的土地改革运动。这些都说明了中国人民得到胜利，绝非偶然，而主要的是由于毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导。影片中反映出中国人民进行地道战、踊跃参军、用木船运送自己的部队、上百万的担架队支援前线，这是表现中国人民有伟大的创造力，中国人民一经动员起来，完全有把握地消灭任何敢于进攻我们国家的侵略者。在这部影片里，我们的中华人民共和国的旗帜飘扬，另一面是国民党的卖国旗帜坠下和美国侵略者的旗帜垂头丧气的情景。我们成千成万的北京人民热烈地庆祝的自己的解放，另一面是美国大使馆紧闭着大门的黯然情景。人民解放军的战士乘的是美国坦克，用的是美国的大炮和自动步枪，这些武器是杜鲁门送给蒋介石的，在战斗中成为我们的胜利品。这种种表现，足以长人民自己之志气，灭敌人之威风。苏联红军解放东北，毛泽东同志和斯大林同志的晤面，中国人民庆贺全世界进步人类伟大的导师斯大林同志的寿辰，显示出苏联是中国最好友的人，中国人民的胜利就是马列主义思想的胜利，中国的五星国旗反映出伟大的俄国十月革命的光辉，这里教育了我们：中国人民的爱国主义和国际主义是完全结合的。影片里充满了成长的嫩芽，满枝的绿叶，百花盛开的花园——充满了美丽的春天的情景。自由的中国人民在人民自己的土地上工作，进行人民自己的工业建设，显示出中国新民主主义社会的无限光明的远景，显示出中国人民的无限美好的将来。
    这是一部极为珍贵的影片，我们希望全国青年和青年团员不只是看，并且深刻地了解其中的意义，将这个意义向广大人民进行广泛的宣传。各地青年团团委在进行爱国主义和国际主义教育时，进行马列主义、毛泽东思想的基本知识的教育时，是应该利用这部影片，作为教育青年与青年团员的良好的教材。
