　　Xinhua News Agency, dated 23rd: Beijing Worker's Daily, in its October 22nd editorial "Struggle to Implement the Correct Policy of Abolishing the Feudal Patronage System and Establishing Stevedoring Companies," pointed out that continuing to implement the policy of abolishing the feudal patronage system and establishing stevedoring companies remains a serious task for trade unions in various regions in the future. The editorial pointed out that this policy has been implemented in some areas over the past eight months and has achieved significant results; however, in many larger cities, such as Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, etc., accounting for more than two-thirds of the country, due to the lack of understanding among trade union cadres of the harm caused by the feudal patronage system of the feudal headmen, or due to fear of the feudal patronage system, they have not resolutely relied on workers to carry out the struggle against the patronage system. Therefore, the feudal patronage system has basically not been abolished. In many places, either the feudal patronage system is preserved intact, or the feudal headmen have become trade union cadres, and they continue to cruelly exploit and oppress the workers.

　　The editorial pointed out that the experience of the past eight months of struggle proves that if trade unions in various regions want to completely eliminate the feudal patronage system in the stevedoring industry and establish stevedoring companies, they must combine the three tasks of abolishing the feudal patronage system, facilitating cargo transportation, and taking care of workers' lives; they must obtain the support of the local people's government by reflecting the situation and proposing solutions; they must obtain the support of the vast number of stevedoring workers by explaining policies and persuading and mobilizing them, so that opposing the feudal exploitation and oppression and patronage system of the headmen becomes their conscious and voluntary action; they must obtain the cooperation of local public security, industrial and commercial departments, and public and private enterprises by explaining the advantages and disadvantages and through common consultation, and organize a unified and powerful force against the feudal patronage system; they must take the method of running training classes to cultivate a group of leading backbone from the active and pure members of the stevedoring workers to carry out the struggle against the feudal patronage system and against the headmen.

　　The editorial pointed out that the steps for abolishing the feudal patronage system and establishing stevedoring companies should be to concentrate forces, make breakthroughs in key areas, and promote the overall situation. The editorial finally pointed out that due to the cruelty, complexity, and arduousness of the struggle to abolish the feudal patronage system, in terms of the ideological style of the stevedoring trade union cadres, they must resolutely oppose the bureaucratic and commandist phenomena that are currently quite common in various regions, such as not caring about the lives of workers, not believing in the power of the masses, and not relying on the power of the masses, and always be vigilant against the conspiracies of hidden headmen and their henchmen.

　　工人日报社论指出：
    继续贯彻废除把持制度、建立搬运公司的方针，仍是今后各地搬运工会中一项严重的斗争任务。
    【新华社二十三日讯】北京工人日报在其二十二日“为贯彻废除封建把持制度，建立搬运公司的正确方针而斗争”的社论中指出，继续贯彻废除封建把持制度、建立搬运公司的方针，仍是今后搬运工会工作中一项严重的斗争任务。社论指出，八个月来这一方针已在部分地方实施，并有显著成绩；但还有许多较大的城市，如沈阳、鞍山、抚顺、上海、广州、石家庄、太原、西安、郑州等约占全国三分之二以上的城市中，由于工会干部对封建脚行头子的封建把持制度的为害认识不足，或对封建把持制度有恐惧心理，没有坚决地依靠工人进行反把持制度的斗争，所以封建把持制度基本上还没有被废除。许多地方不是把封建把持制度原封不动的保存下来，就是封建把头当了工会的干部，他们依然在残酷地剥削与压迫着工人。
    社论指出：八个月来的斗争经验证明：各地搬运工会要想彻底消灭搬运事业中的封建把持制度，建立搬运公司，必须把废除封建把持制度、便利货物运输和照顾工人生活三项工作结合进行；必须以反映情况、提出方案的办法，去取得当地人民政府的支持；必须以讲解政策、说服动员的方式，去取得广大搬运工人的拥护，使反对脚行头子的封建剥削压迫与把持制度，成为他们自觉自愿的行动；必须以说明利害、共同协商的方式去取得当地公安、工商部门与公私企业的配合，组织一个反对封建把持制度的统一的强大的力量；必须采取开办训练班的方式，从搬运工人的积极而纯洁的分子中，培养一批领导骨干，进行反封建把持制度和反把头的斗争。
    社论指出：进行废除封建把持制度建立搬运公司的步骤应是集中力量、重点突破、推动全盘的办法。社论最后指出：由于废除封建把持制度斗争的残酷、复杂与艰巨，在搬运工会干部的思想作风方面就必须坚决反对目前在各地几乎相当普遍存在着的那种不关心工人生活、不相信群众的力量、不依靠群众力量的官僚主义、命令主义的现象，并随时严防隐蔽的把头及其爪牙的阴谋活动。
