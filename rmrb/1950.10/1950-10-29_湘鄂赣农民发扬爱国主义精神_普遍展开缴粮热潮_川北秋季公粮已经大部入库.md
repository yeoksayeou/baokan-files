Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 27th. Peasants in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces are currently enthusiastically delivering autumn grain. So far, according to statistics from only four special districts in Hunan Province, more than 300 million jin of public grain have been put into storage; among them, more than 90 percent of public grain has been put into storage in eight counties including Anxiang. In Hubei Province, the grain delivery work in seven special districts including Xiaogan and Huanggang is also progressing rapidly. The public grain that has been put into storage in Xiaogan Special District accounts for two-thirds of the total autumn grain levy. It is estimated that the autumn grain levy in the province will be largely completed by mid-November. At present, more than 180 million jin of public grain have also been put into storage in Jiangxi Province.

During the grain delivery, peasants in various places promoted the spirit of patriotism and universally launched a grain delivery craze. Peasants in Qiguan Township, Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, delivered all their public grain to the warehouse in two days due to sufficient preparation. Peasants in the Fifth District and Third Bao of Nan County, Hunan Province, used a windmill to winnow the grain three times. Li Yuanqing, a peasant in Gaoyi Township, Pingjiang County, covered the baskets with his own clothes to prevent the public grain from getting wet when he encountered rain on the way to deliver the public grain to the warehouse.

Since the beginning of the autumn grain levy in the above three provinces, governments at all levels have established grain levy committees to strengthen leadership over the autumn grain levy work. In the process of grain levy, governments at all levels also mobilized the vast number of peasants to launch a struggle against landlords who concealed land, so as to correctly assess yields and make the agricultural tax burden more fair and reasonable. In Qiyang County, Hunan Province alone, 30,000 mu of land concealed by landlords were found. In addition, various places also combined the autumn grain levy with rent reduction and publicity of the Land Reform Law, leading peasants to combat the conspiracy of illegal landlords to force rent collection, seize tenants, disrupt the autumn grain levy, and disrupt land reform, thus further enhancing peasants' enthusiasm for grain delivery.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 26th. Since the Northern Sichuan Administrative Region began collecting autumn public grain in early September, the public grain stored in warehouses throughout the region has reached 65 percent of the original target due to the enthusiastic grain delivery by peasants. Among them, Nanchong City and nine counties and cities including Yanting and Santai have all been put into storage. The public grain put into storage in various counties in the Suining Special District has also reached 90 percent. The entire region can basically be completed by the end of October, which can be advanced by half a month to one month compared with the original completion deadline.

An important reason why this year's autumn levy work in Northern Sichuan District has been carried out fairly quickly and smoothly is that the ideology and work style of the grain levy cadres have generally been improved after rectification. In their work, they resolutely implemented the autumn levy policy, relied on the masses, overcame the shortcomings of commandism, and avoided the phenomenon of excessive lightness and heaviness. Many peasants said: This grain levy method is fair and reasonable. Secondly, when deploying the levy work, all places convened people's representatives conferences at all levels and county and district peasant representative conferences. Village meetings, etc., studied the methods of implementing policies and completing tasks. Grain levy cadres in various places also relied on activists among the peasants and united the broad social forces to sanction individual illegal acts of resisting grain. At the same time, the people's governments in various places paid special attention to the central link of checking black land and assessing yields, and conducted investigations and studies on the types of villages before the autumn levy to grasp the basic situation.

　　湘鄂赣农民发扬爱国主义精神
    普遍展开缴粮热潮
    川北秋季公粮已经大部入库
    【新华社汉口二十七日电】湘、鄂、赣三省农民近正踊跃缴纳秋季公粮。到目前为止，湖南省仅据长沙等四个专区统计，入仓公粮即达三亿余斤；其中安乡等八个县入仓公粮目前已达百分之九十以上。湖北省孝感、黄冈等七个专区，缴粮工作进展也很迅速，孝感专区已入仓的公粮占秋征公粮总数的三分之二，预计全省的秋征十一月中旬即大体结束。江西省目前入仓公粮亦有一亿八千多万斤。
    在缴粮中，各地农民发扬了爱国主义的精神，普遍地展开缴粮热潮。湖南省宁乡县奇观乡的农民，由于准备充分，两天内把公粮扫数入仓。该省南县五区三保农民，都用风车把谷子扇过三遍。平江县高义乡农民李元清，在送公粮入仓时，途中遇雨，为了防止公粮受潮，他把自己的衣服脱下来，盖在箩筐上，使公粮避免雨淋。
    上述三省自开始秋征以来，各级人民政府都成立了征粮委员会，加强对秋征工作的领导。征粮过程中，各级人民政府并发动了广大农民向不法地主展开反瞒地斗争，以便正确地评订产量，使农业税负担更趋公平合理，仅湖南省祁阳县即查出地主隐瞒的土地三万亩。此外，各地并结合秋征进行了减租和宣传土地改革法，领导农民打击不法地主逼租夺佃、破坏秋征、破坏土地改革的阴谋，因而更加提高了农民缴粮的热忱。
    【新华社重庆二十六日电】川北行政区自九月初旬开始征收秋季公粮以来，由于农民踊跃缴粮，全区入仓公粮已达原定任务百分之六十五，其中南充市和盐亭、三台等九县、市已全部入仓，遂宁专区各县入仓公粮亦达百分之九十，全区在十月底基本上可告完成，较原定完成期限可提前半月至一月。
    川北区今年秋征工作进行得相当迅速和顺利的重要原因，是征粮工作干部经过整风后，思想和作风普遍有了改进。他们在工作中坚决执行秋征政策，依靠群众，克服了命令主义的毛病，避免了畸轻畸重的现象。许多农民都说：这次征粮办法，公平合理。其次是在布置征收工作时，各地均召开了各界人民代表会议以及县、区农民代表会议。村民大会等，研究了执行政策与完成任务的方法。各地征粮工作干部并依靠农民中的积极分子，团结广大社会力量，对于个别抗粮之非法制裁。同时各地人民政府特别注意查黑地评产量这一中心环节，秋征前即分别村庄类型，进行了调查研究，掌握了基本情况。
