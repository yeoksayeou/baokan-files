　　Mobilize Sailors for Supporting the Front and Assisting the Third Field Army in Completing the Task of Landing on Taiwan!
    Hua East Industrial Labor Model Liang Shimin
    In the battle to liberate the Zhoushan Archipelago and the Shengsi Islands, my job as a crew member—a Communist Party member—was to get the soldiers ashore. When the ship could no longer advance, the landing of the First Company's soldiers and the lives of the entire ship rested on my shoulders. This burden, whether it weighed a thousand jin or ten thousand jin, as a Communist Party member, I would shoulder it with a thousand jin if it was a thousand jin, and with ten thousand jin if it was ten thousand jin; there was no other way to say it. Under enemy fire, you couldn't rely on others, and no matter how great the difficulties, you had to find a solution. It was no use being anxious if the soldiers couldn't land; I should jump into the sea and find sailboats to get the soldiers ashore. If supplies couldn't be brought in and the enemy couldn't be eliminated, resulting in losses, I would be responsible. When the landing craft arrived, the soldiers were sent ashore, and the enemy was eliminated. The task the Party gave me to assist in the liberation of the Shengsi Islands was completed. The reason I was able to be so brave was because of the Party's long-term cultivation and education, which made me realize that in critical and tense moments of battle, a Communist Party member should step forward, ready to die. At the same time, I further realized that only by finally eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs on the islands could the people along the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang live in peace and work happily.
    In the entire revolutionary cause, I personally made this small contribution to the people and the Party, and the people gave me infinite glory. This is the result of the education by the Party and Chairman Mao.
    As the National Day approaches, I want to formulate my future work plan:
    (1) According to the instructions given to me by Chairman Mao and the Party, I will not be arrogant or complacent, but will examine myself and learn scientific techniques from older workers.
    (2) Wherever the people send me, I will go. Mobilize sailors for supporting the front and assisting the Third Field Army in completing the task of landing on Taiwan.
    (3) After the liberation of the whole country, strive to create a future for the aquatic products industry and develop the fisheries along the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.
    I will repay the Party's cultivation and the people's expectations with such a work plan. From practical work, I will improve the quality of myself as a Communist Party member.

　　把海员支前工作动员起来，协助三野完成登陆台湾任务！
    华东工业劳动模范  梁石民
    在解放舟山群岛嵊泗列岛的战斗中，我一个船员——共产党员的工作者，就是要把战士送到岸上去。船不能前进了，一连战士的登陆和全船的生命都放在我身上。这副担子，不管一千斤还是一万斤重，作为一个共产党员的我来说，有一千斤就担一千斤，有一万斤就担一万斤，没有第二句话好讲。在炮火下，不能指望别人，不管碰着多大困难，就要想办法。战士不能登陆，着急也没有用，我就应该跳到海里想办法找帆船，把战士送到陆上去。如果接济不上，敌人不能消灭，受到损失，我要负责的。登陆艇来了，把战士送上去，消灭敌人。党付给我协助解放嵊泗列岛的任务完成了。我所以能这样的勇敢，是因为受了党长期的培养和教育，使我认识到当战斗危急紧张的关头，共产党员应该挺身而出，视死如归。同时，我更认识到只有最后消灭岛屿上的蒋匪帮，江浙沿海人民才能安居乐业。
    我个人在整个革命事业中，对人民对党是有了这一点贡献，人民给了我无限的光荣，这是党和毛主席教育我的结果。
    国庆到来时，我要订出今后的工作计划：
    （一）根据毛主席和党给我的指示，不骄不傲，检查自己，向老年工人学习掌握科学技术。
    （二）人民让我到那里，我就到那里。把海员支前工作动员起来，协助三野完成登陆台湾的任务。
    （三）争取全国解放后，把水产事业的前途创造出来，发展江浙沿海的渔业。
    以这样的工作计划来报答党对我的培养和人民对我的期待。从实际工作中，提高我一个共产党员的品质。
