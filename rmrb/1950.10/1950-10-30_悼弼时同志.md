In Memory of Comrade Bi Shishi
    Gan Siqi
    Comrade Bi Shishi! You were one of my most respected direct superiors. Your death has caused me to shed unstoppable tears of sorrow. Only a week ago, I personally saw your face and heard your loving words. At that time, I was under the impression that your health had improved, but who knew that would be our last farewell. For nineteen years and five months, I accompanied you in Longgang, Xianggan, Xiang'e, the border regions of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, and across snowy mountains and grasslands. I directly listened to your teachings. Your unwavering will, sincere and arduous work style, amiable and attentive attitude made you unforgettable to me and all comrades who shared life, death, and hardship. Now, we are forever separated! Everything is deeply imprinted in my heart for the rest of my life.

　　悼弼时同志
    甘泗淇
    弼时同志！你是我最敬爱的直接首长之一。你的死，使我拭不干的热泪禁不住的流出来。一星期前还亲见你的音容，聆受了你的热爱，当时满以为你的健康已有增进，谁知这就是最后一次握别。十九年零五个月以来，曾在龙岗、湘赣、湘鄂、川黔滇边，雪山草地，伴随着你的身旁，直聆你的教育，你的坚忍不拔的意志，诚恳艰苦的作风，和蔼殷勤的态度，使我及一切同生死共患难的同志们，永远忘不了你，而今是永别了！一切，只是毕生深印于我的心窝。
