　　Beware of American Imperialist Espionage Activities!
    French Communist Party Secretary Duclos Survives Assassination Attempt by Thugs
    The Reactionaries' Despicable Actions Arouse Popular Anger
    [Xinhua News Agency, 10th] Paris dispatch: French Communist Party Secretary Duclos was giving a speech at a mass rally in Auch, Gers, southern France, on the night of the 8th when thugs threw a bomb. Ten people in attendance were injured, including two women. Duclos was not hit.
    According to TASS: The Paris newspaper "Ce Soir" pointed out that this incident has greatly angered the French people. The newspaper wrote: The Vichy assassination squad, recently revived by Moch, has drawn up plans to bomb the premises of various democratic groups and assassinate people's leaders fighting for peace and freedom. This action proves the cowardice and terror of those who cannot answer the words of fighters for peace and freedom. "Ce Soir" emphasized that murderers must be prevented from doing harm, and such despicable actions must be stopped.
    According to Telepress: "L'Humanité" wrote an article on the 9th exposing that "American imperialists are using political assassinations to intimidate peace fighters in order to carry out acts of aggression with impunity." "L'Humanité" emphasized that "this attack is closely related to the persecution of Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti, Japanese Communist Party General Secretary Tokuda Kyuichi, and Belgian Communist Party Chairman Lahaut. These assassination attempts are orchestrated by the same party."

    法共书记杜克洛遭暴徒暗杀未中
    反动派卑劣行动激起人民愤怒
    【新华社十日讯】巴黎消息：法国共产党书记杜克洛于八日夜在法国南部席尔省的奥什举行的群众大会上演说时，遭暴徒投掷炸弹。与会者群众受伤者达十人，包括妇女二人。杜克洛未被击中。
    据塔斯社报道：巴黎“今晚报”指出，这一事件使法国人民极为愤怒。该报写道：为莫克所复活不久的维琪暗杀队，拟订了爆炸各民主团体房舍与谋杀争取和平与自由的人民领袖的计划。这一行动证明了那些对于和平与自由战士的言论无法作答的人们的懦弱和惊恐。“今晚报”强调指出：必须使杀人犯不再为害，必须制止这种卑劣行动。
    据电通社讯：人道报九日撰论揭露：“美帝国主义者正使用政治暗杀的方法恫吓和平斗士，以便放手肆行侵略行为。”人道报着重指出：“这种攻击是与意大利共产党总书记托里亚蒂、日本共产党总书记德田球一和比利时共产党主席拉豪特的遭受迫害事件密切相关。这种谋害行为是由同一方面所主使的。”
