　　Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, 21st: The Australian Menzies government officially declared the Australian Communist Party illegal on the 20th. This fascist bill was proposed by the Menzies government on April 27th this year and passed by the House of Representatives on May 23rd. When the bill was submitted to the Senate for discussion, the Labor Party group, which held a majority in the Senate, had to vote against it due to the strong protests from the people of Australia and the world, and therefore it was not passed. However, under intensified pressure from the Menzies government, the Labor Party Executive Committee finally ordered the Labor Party group in the Senate to vote in favor. The bill was then passed by the Senate on the 19th of this month. Subsequently, the Menzies government announced its implementation the next day after the bill was approved by Governor-General McKell. According to a dispatch from the Electric News Agency: The Australian government has also appointed a committee to consider expanding this bill to non-communist organizations and individuals.

　　This fascist action by the Menzies government has aroused strong opposition from all Australian working people. According to an Electric News Agency dispatch from Sydney, the Australian Communist Party and seven of the largest trade unions, including the Coal Miners' Federation, the Dockworkers' Union, the Seamen's Union, and the Federal Ironworkers' Union, have filed a lawsuit with the Supreme Court, demanding that the bill be declared unconstitutional and requesting that a temporary injunction be issued first to delay the implementation of the bill. The Australian Communist Party's newspaper, *The Tribune*, announced that it will continue to fight for its policies, regardless of the atrocities of Menzies and his Labor Party accomplices.

　　Mass movements protesting this fascist bill are unfolding throughout Australia. Fifteen hundred transport workers in Sydney held demonstrations, and miners in New South Wales have gone on strike. Twenty-six thousand dockworkers in sixty-five ports have been on strike since the 18th to protest the Labor Party's betrayal, resulting in the suspension of four hundred and sixty ships.

　　澳反动政府竟宣布澳共“非法”
    全澳劳动人民强烈抗议
    澳共机关报宣布澳共将继续斗争
    【新华社二十一日讯】悉尼消息：澳大利亚孟席斯政府已于二十日正式宣布澳大利亚共产党为非法。这一法西斯法案系孟席斯政府于今年四月二十七日提出，于五月二十三日经众院通过。当该案送交参院讨论时，占参院多数的工党集团因慑于全澳与全世界人民的强烈抗议，不得不投票反对，因此未获通过。但在孟席斯政府加紧压力下，工党执委会终于命令参议院工党集团投赞成票。该案遂于本月十九日在参院通过。接着，孟席斯政府即于次日在该法案经总督麦克尔批准后予以公布施行。据电通社称：澳政府并已任命了一个委员会，考虑将这一法案扩大到非共产党的组织与个人。
    孟席斯政府这一法西斯行动，已激起全澳劳动人民的强烈反对。据电通社悉尼讯，澳大利亚共产党和煤矿工人联合会、码头工人联合会、海员工会及联邦铁工联合会等七个最大的工会，已向最高法院提出控诉。要求宣布这一法案为违宪，并要求首先发布临时法令来延迟这个法案的实施。澳共机关报《论坛报》宣布：将不顾孟席斯及其工党帮凶的暴行，继续为它的政策而斗争。
    抗议这一法西斯法案的群众运动正在全澳展开。悉尼一千五百名运输工人举行了游行示威，新南威尔士的矿工已经罢工。六十五个港口的二万六千名码头工人，自十八日起即罢工抗议工党的叛卖行动，四百六十艘船只因此而停驶。
