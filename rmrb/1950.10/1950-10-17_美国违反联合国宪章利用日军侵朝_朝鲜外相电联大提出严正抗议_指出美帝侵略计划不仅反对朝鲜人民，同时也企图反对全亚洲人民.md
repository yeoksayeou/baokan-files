Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th: According to a TASS dispatch from Pyongyang on the 15th: Pak Hon-yong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, sent a letter of protest to the President of the United Nations General Assembly and the President of the Security Council, protesting against the use of Japanese soldiers by American imperialism in the war of aggression against Korea.

The protest letter stated: The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has extensive investigative materials with conclusive facts proving that the United States is actually using Japanese soldiers in the war against the Korean people. For example, a large number of Japanese participated in the fighting in the Seoul area. A company of Japanese soldiers fought alongside the South Korean army in the Cheorwon area. There are also many Japanese in the 7th and 8th divisions of the Syngman Rhee army. The United States' use of Japanese soldiers to participate in armed intervention in Korea once again flagrantly violates the United Nations Charter and the post-war international agreements on Japan.

The protest letter pointed out: The use of Japanese soldiers to participate in armed intervention in Korea exposes the brutal aggression plan of American imperialism, which is not only to oppose the Korean people, but also to oppose all the people of Asia. This fact can be proven by the secret agreement concluded between the Japanese imperialists and the United States. The purpose of this agreement is to revive Japanese imperialism and jointly act to oppose the national liberation movements in Korea and other Asian countries. The reappearance of Japanese "samurai" in our East reminds the Korean people of the dark period under Japanese rule.

The protest letter concluded: The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea brings the above facts to the attention of the United Nations Organization and strongly protests the new violation of international agreements and the United Nations Charter. I hope that the content of this statement will be circulated among all member states of the United Nations and that I will be informed of the measures to be taken on this issue.

　　美国违反联合国宪章利用日军侵朝
    朝鲜外相电联大提出严正抗议
    指出美帝侵略计划不仅反对朝鲜人民，同时也企图反对全亚洲人民
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社十五日平壤电：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永顷以抗议书致联合国大会主席及安全理事会主席，抗议美国帝国主义在侵略朝鲜的战争中使用日本军人。
    抗议书称：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府握有事实确凿的广泛调查材料，证明美国在反朝鲜人民的战争中竟使用日本军人。例如，在汉城地区的战斗中，就有大量的日本人参战。一连日本兵曾与南朝鲜军队一起在铁原地区作战。李承晚军第七师和第八师中也有许多日本人。美国利用日本军人参加武装干涉朝鲜，再度悍然违犯了联合国宪章和战后对日本的国际协定。
    抗议书指出：利用日本军人参加武装干涉朝鲜，暴露了美国帝国主义残暴的侵略计划不仅是要反对朝鲜人民，而且也是要反对亚洲全体人民。这件事实，可由日本帝国主义者和美国之间缔结的秘密协定得到证明。该协定的目的，是要使日本帝国主义复活，并联合行动，来反对朝鲜及其他亚洲各国的民族解放运动。日本的“武士”再度在我们的东方出现，使朝鲜人民想起了日本统治下的黑暗时期。
    抗议书最后称：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府将上述事实提请联合国组织注意，并坚决抗议对国际协定和联合国宪章的新的破坏。我希望此项声明的内容将在联合国全体会员国中间传阅，并请告知对这个问题所将采取的措施。
