Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, October 23rd. To coordinate with the autumn purchase work and stabilize market prices, the state-owned trading companies in the Central and South China region are organizing large-scale distribution of industrial goods to the countryside.

Since July, state-owned trading companies at all levels in the Central and South China region, while purchasing summer and autumn agricultural products, have also been preparing to promote a large quantity of industrial goods in the countryside. From September to early October, flower and cotton cloth companies at all levels sold more than 347,850 bolts of various cloths and 6,336 bales of cotton yarn. From July to early October, department stores at all levels sold goods worth over 154.3 billion yuan. State-owned native produce and tea companies have also organized the distribution of some industrial goods to the countryside during purchasing. State-owned trade organizations have expanded from large and medium-sized cities to counties and larger towns. In areas with inconvenient transportation, they have also sent out trade teams and have extensively established wholesale and consignment relationships with cooperatives and private merchants. As a result, the sales volume in rural areas has increased significantly. For example, the ratio of urban to rural salt sales by the Shashi Salt Company in Hubei Province increased from 26:1 in June to 4:1 in September. In small and medium-sized cities in Henan and Hunan provinces, more than half of the goods from state-owned companies are sold to rural areas. Under the active guidance and assistance of state-owned companies, some private merchants in cities have also begun to change their business policies and transport large quantities of goods to rural areas for sale. In mid-August, private silk and cloth shops such as NanChang's Xin Xin, Xin Da, and Wan Xiang sent sales teams to the countryside, with a total turnover of 130 million yuan in twenty days. Private salt companies in Changsha, Hunan, such as Jiu Da, Yong Yu, and Tong Ji, have been transporting salt to Liuyang and Xiangtan in the province for sale since July, and have expanded to towns such as Daoxian, Dong'an, and Baiyashi since August. Among them, Jiu Da Company's salt sales in August increased by more than 316,000 jin compared to July.

Due to the large-scale supply from state-owned trading companies, cooperatives, and some private merchants in the Central and South China region, the supply and demand relationship of industrial goods in the rural market has gradually become normal. The scissors difference between most industrial and agricultural products has not continued to widen; the gap of a few commodities that had been too large in the past has also narrowed to a certain extent. For example, grain prices in most areas of Central and South China have always been low. Since September, due to state-owned companies' purchasing and organizing the distribution of industrial goods to the countryside, the difference between grain and industrial product prices has gradually decreased. Taking the five major cities of Changsha, Hengyang, Changde, Xiangtan, and Yiyang in Hunan Province as examples, compared with October 12, the exchange rate of cotton yarn, fine cloth, crude salt, and rice at the end of August showed that the difference in cotton yarn prices narrowed by 14 percent, fine cloth narrowed by 17.3 percent, and crude salt narrowed by 21.5 percent.

### 配合秋购工作稳定市场物价  中南区组织大量工业品下乡

　　配合秋购工作稳定市场物价
    中南区组织大量工业品下乡
    【新华社汉口二十三日电】中南区国营贸易公司组织大量工业品下乡，配合秋购工作，稳定了市场物价。
    七月份以来，中南区各地国营贸易公司在收购夏、秋季农产品的同时，筹办了大批工业品下乡推销。从九月到十月上旬，各级花纱布公司销出各种布达三十四万七千八百五十多匹，棉纱六千三百三十六件。各级百货公司从七月到十月上旬，销出各种货品达一千五百四十三亿余元。国营土产、茶叶等公司也在收购中组织了部分工业品下乡。国营贸易机构由于已由大、中城市发展到县和较大的乡镇，在交通不便的地区也多已派出贸易小组，并与合作社及私商广泛建立了批发与代销关系。因此农村的销货量大增。如湖北沙市盐业公司城乡售盐的比例，即由六月份的二十六比一，提高到九月份的四比一，河南、湖南等省的中、小城市，国营公司半数以上货物都销往农村。在国营公司积极指导和帮助下，各地城市中部分私商也开始改变了经营方针，将大量货物运销农村。八月中旬南昌新新、新大、万象等私营绸布店派出推销小组下乡，二十天内营业总额达一亿三千万元。湖南长沙私营久大、永裕、通济等盐业公司，七月份起就运盐到该省浏阳、湘潭等地销售，八月份以来更扩展到道县、东安、白牙市等城镇。其中久大公司八月份销盐量与七月份相比，增加了三十一万六千余斤。
    由于中南区国营贸易公司、合作社和部分私商的大量供应，农村市场工业品的供求关系已经渐趋正常，大部工业品和农业品的剪刀差价都未继续扩大；少数货品过去差价过大的，且有了一定程度的缩小。如中南大部地区的粮价一向偏低，九月份以来，由于国营公司的收购并组织工业品下乡，粮食和工业品的差价已经逐步回小。以湖南省的长沙、衡阳、常德、湘潭、益阳等五大城市为例，八月底棉纱、细布、芦盐和大米的交换率，和十月十二日相比，棉纱差价缩小了百分之十四，细布缩小了百分之十七点三，芦盐缩小了百分之二十一点五。
