　　Xinhua News Agency, October 26th, TASS, October 24th: The Tokyo court, at the request of the defense lawyer of arrested Japanese Communist Party Central Committee member Kasuga Shoichi, held a court session on the 20th. The court was guarded by augmented police squads. When Kasuga Shoichi, in handcuffs, was brought into the courtroom, representatives of the progressive masses responded with enthusiastic cheers.

　　In his statement, Kasuga Shoichi pointed out that he had been illegally arrested and demanded immediate release. Kasuga Shoichi described the suffering in prison. Eight people were imprisoned in a small cell of nine square feet.

　　However, despite Kasuga Shoichi's completely unreasonable arrest, the court still decided to imprison him.

　　Note: Kasuga Shoichi was illegally "purged" by MacArthur on June 6th along with twenty-three other members of the Japanese Communist Party Central Committee. Since July, the American and Japanese reactionaries have dispatched a large number of detectives to search for nine JCP leaders, including Kasuga Shoichi, in an attempt to further persecute them. Kasuga Shoichi was illegally arrested by the police in Nagoya on October 7th and escorted to Tokyo. Before the trial began, the American and Japanese reactionaries attempted to force Kasuga Shoichi to provide information about the other eight JCP leaders, but they failed.

　　日共领袖春日正一
    在法庭抗议非法被捕
    进步群众代表报以热烈欢呼
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社二十四日讯：东京法庭应被捕的日本共产党中央委员春日正一的辩护律师的要求，于二十日开庭。法庭由增派的警察队加以守卫。当带着手铐的春日正一被带进法庭时，进步群众的代表们报以热烈的欢呼。
    春日正一在发言时指出他是被非法逮捕的，要求立即释放。春日正一叙述监狱中的苦况。在一个九平方英尺的小牢内，监禁了八个人。
    然而，尽管春日正一遭受完全无理的逮捕，法庭依旧决定将他监禁起来。
    按：春日正一在六月六日与其他二十三名日共中央委员同时被麦克阿瑟非法“整肃”。自七月以来，美、日反动派曾出动大批警探，搜捕包括春日正一在内的九名日共领袖，企图对他们进一步迫害。春日正一于十月七日在名古屋被警察非法逮捕，并被押解东京。在法庭开审前，美、日反动派曾企图强制春日正一提供关于其他八名日共领袖的情报，但遭到了失败。
