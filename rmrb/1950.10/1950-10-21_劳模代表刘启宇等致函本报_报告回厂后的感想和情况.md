    Labor Model Representatives Liu Qiyu and Others Write to This Newspaper
    Reporting Their Thoughts and Situation After Returning to the Factory
    [This newspaper's report] After the national labor model representatives Liu Qiyu, Jia Dingxun, Jiang Zhenyuan, and Li Molin returned to their factories, they specially wrote to this newspaper to report their feelings about the National Labor Model Representative Conference and the production situation of the factory.
    Liu Qiyu said that he gained valuable experience from visiting the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory and the Sprayer Manufacturing Factory in Beijing. The factory promised to send him all the working drawings to help them improve their production technology. When visiting the Sprayer Manufacturing Factory, it was four minutes before get off work, but the workers automatically extended the time until he finished the tour. Liu Qiyu said: "I see the bright future of my country's agricultural machinery industry." He said that he was deeply moved by the love of the working class this time and would only work harder to thank everyone for their help and love.
    Jia Dingxun, a labor model representative from Benxi Coal and Iron Company, wrote in a letter: As soon as he returned to the workshop, the workers surrounded him, and the first sentence they asked was, have you seen Chairman Mao? What did Chairman Mao say? How is Chairman Mao's health? The workers said that their workshop had overfulfilled the production task for September, the quality had been greatly improved, and the life of the furnace body had been extended. Their workshop is now strengthening the responsibility system and labor discipline, and is preparing for the workshop economic accounting system in order to continue to improve quality and reduce costs. The Benxi Municipal Party Committee, the Federation of Trade Unions, and the administration are focusing on the special steel plant led by Jia Dingxun to pilot the workshop economic accounting work. Jia Dingxun is leading the workers to do a good job in the three-prevention work in order to ensure safe production, complete the 1950 production plan ahead of schedule, and realize Chairman Mao's call and instructions.
    Jiang Zhenyuan, a labor model representative from the De County Works Section of the Tianjin Railway Administration, wrote in a letter: "Looking at the merits of those combat heroes, and then looking at my little achievements, they are like water in the ocean, and I am like a small drop of water." He called on the workers to learn from the heroic and selfless spirit of the female combat hero Guo Junqing and the factory-protecting model Zhao Guilan to complete production tasks.
    Li Molin, a labor model from Tianjin Hygiene Material Factory, wrote in a letter: "After returning from the meeting, I always remember what Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu said to us, and I am more careful when I return to the factory to work."

    劳模代表刘启宇等致函本报
    报告回厂后的感想和情况
    【本报讯】全国劳模代表刘启宇，贾鼎勋，姜振元，李墨林回到他们的工厂以后，特致函本报，报告他们对于此次全国劳模代表会议的感想和工厂的生产情况。
    刘启宇说，他在北京参观华北农业机械厂和喷雾器制造厂，获得了宝贵的经验。该厂答应把全部工作图样寄给他，帮助他们改进生产技术。在喷雾器制造厂参观时，本来差四分钟就下班了，工友们自动延长时间，直等他参观完了才下工。刘启宇说：“我看见了我国农业机械工业的光明前途。”他说：他此次被工人阶级的友爱深深感动，只有在工作中加倍努力，来感谢各位的帮助和友爱。
    本溪煤铁公司劳模代表贾鼎勋来信说：他一回到工场，工友包围了他，第一句话就问看到了毛主席没有？毛主席讲了些什么话？毛主席身体怎样？工友们说：他们工场九月份生产任务超额完成了，质量大大提高了，炉体寿命延长了。他们工场现在正在加强责任制和劳动纪律，为了继续提高质量和降低成本，正做车间经济核算制的准备工作。本溪市委、总工会、行政正把贾鼎勋领导的特殊钢厂做为重点，试行车间经济核算工作。贾鼎勋正领导工友作好三防工作，以便安全生产，提前完成一九五○年生产计划，实现毛主席的号召与指示。
    天津铁路管理局德县工务段劳模代表姜振元来信说：“看看人家战斗英雄那些功劳，再看看我这点成绩，人家像海洋里的水，我就像小水点一样。”他号召工友学习女战斗英雄郭俊卿，护厂模范赵桂兰的英勇忘我精神，来完成生产任务。
    天津卫生材料厂劳模李墨林来信说：“开会回来，心里总是不忘毛主席和朱总司令对我们说的话，回到厂来工作是更加小心了。”
