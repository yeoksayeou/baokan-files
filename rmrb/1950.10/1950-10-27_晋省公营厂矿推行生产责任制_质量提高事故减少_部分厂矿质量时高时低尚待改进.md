　　Shanxi Province State-Owned Factories and Mines Implement Production Responsibility System
    Quality Improves, Accidents Decrease
    Quality Fluctuates in Some Factories and Mines, Improvements Still Needed
    [Xinhua News Agency News] State-owned factories and mines in Shanxi Province, while carrying out the New Record Movement, have implemented a production responsibility system, resulting in a significant improvement in product quality and a substantial reduction in accidents. The Taiyuan Cement Factory's quality has reached the advanced level of similar industries nationwide. The Changzhi Egg Factory's egg products meet export standards. The ash content of coal supplied for coking by the Fujiatan Coal Mine decreased from 20% in July to 17.94%, and further decreased to 17.04% in August. In the foundry department of the Yucai Steel Factory, the scrap rate of some products was as high as 100% in May, but by early August, all scrap products had been eliminated. The scrap rate of the Zhenxing Machine Factory also decreased from 60% to 6.6%. Regarding the elimination of accidents: The three power plants under the Electricity Bureau had 33 accidents in July, but only one plant had one accident in August. The Yuci Flour Mill had 42 accidents in the first half of the year, but completely eliminated accidents in July and August. The number of injured workers at the Taiyuan Dongshan Coal Mine decreased by half in July compared to June, and no one was injured in August.

    During the New Record Movement, each factory and mine aimed to overcome the main shortcomings in its own production as the goal of the competition. For example, the Taiyuan Cement Factory, Fujiatan Coal Mine, Zhenxing Machine Factory, etc., focused on improving quality, while the Electricity Bureau's plants, Dongshan Coal Mine, and Yuci Flour Mill focused particularly on eliminating accidents. First, each factory extensively mobilized workers to thoroughly examine the shortcomings in production through meetings of the management committee, workers' representative meetings, and workshop groups, and educated workers with examples of past shortcomings harming national production and construction and the vital interests of workers. The Fujiatan Coal Mine announced the contract between the mine and the steel factory to the workers, explaining that the contract stipulated a reward of 10,000 jin of millet per month if the ash content of the coal delivered according to the current volume was reduced to below 13%, while in May, because the ash content increased to 26.98%, the coal price was deducted by 11.98% per ton, thus reducing income and hindering the improvement of workers' lives such as wages and welfare. The Zhenxing Machine Factory specifically calculated for the workers the losses caused by 7,000 waterwheels due to unqualified sprocket wheels, which not only consumed state resources but also hindered the interests of agricultural production, and would directly affect the future of the factory. The Taiyuan Cement Factory also announced the letters from the ordering agency requesting the termination of the contract due to the poor quality of the factory's cement. These examples greatly inspired the workers' sense of production responsibility, and as a result, at the workers' conscious request, responsibility systems such as technical operating procedures, finished product inspection, machine safety and maintenance, tool responsibility, financial supply and sales, and contact contracts were formulated. Due to the establishment of the responsibility system, the chaotic phenomena in past production management have begun to be overcome, and this system has become the main driving force for improving product quality and reducing accidents in various factories and mines.

    However, the progress of the movement is currently uneven. The responsibility systems such as operating procedures and finished product inspection in some factories and mines are not yet sound, or lack inspection, so that the quality of products is sometimes high and sometimes low, and safety is not guaranteed.

### 晋省公营厂矿推行生产责任制  质量提高事故减少  部分厂矿质量时高时低尚待改进

　　晋省公营厂矿推行生产责任制
    质量提高事故减少
    部分厂矿质量时高时低尚待改进
    【新华社讯】山西省公营厂矿在开展新纪录运动中推行生产责任制，产品质量显著提高，事故大为减少。太原洋灰厂质量已达全国先进同业水平。长治蛋厂的蛋品已合乎出口标准。富家滩煤矿供炼焦用煤的含灰分，七月份由百分之二十降至百分之十七点九四，八月份又再度降至百分之十七点零四。育才钢铁厂翻砂部五月份有些产品的废品率高达百分之百，到八月上旬则已全部消灭废品。振兴机器厂报废率也由百分之六十降至百分之六点六。在消灭事故方面：电业局所属三个发电厂，七月份发生过三十三次事故，八月份仅有一个厂发生过一次事故。榆次面粉厂上半年发生事故达四十二次，七、八两月则全部消灭了事故。太原东山煤矿受伤人数七月份比六月份减少一半，八月份做到无一人受伤。
    新纪录运动中，各厂矿均以克服本单位生产上的主要缺点作为竞赛目标，如太原洋灰厂、富家滩煤矿、振兴机器厂等以提高质量为主，电业局各厂、东山煤矿及榆次面粉厂则特别致力于消灭事故。各厂首先经过管理委员会议、职工代表会、车间小组等会议，广泛发动职工深入检查生产上所存在的缺点，并以过去所存缺点损害国家生产建设与工人切身利益的实例，教育职工。富家滩煤矿将该矿与钢铁厂所订合同向工人公布，说明合同规定按现在运交量的煤炭灰分减至百分之十三以下时每月奖给小米万斤，而五月份因灰分增至百分之二十六点九八，每吨便扣去煤价的百分之十一点九八，因此收入减少而妨害了工资和福利等职工生活的改善。振兴机器厂向工人具体地计算了七千部水车因链子轮不合规格而造成的损失，不但耗损国家资财，而且妨害了农业生产的利益，更将直接影响工厂的前途。太原洋灰厂也将订货机关因该厂洋灰质量不好而要解除合同的信件公布。这些实例大大地启发了职工的生产责任感，从而在职工自觉要求下，订出了技术规程、成品检验、机器安全与检修、工具专责、财务供销与联系合同等责任制度。由于责任制的建立，过去生产管理中的混乱现象已开始克服了这个制度并成为各厂矿产品质量提高事故减少的主要推动力量。
    但目前运动的进展并不平衡，有些厂矿的操作规程、成品检验等责任制还不健全，或者缺乏检查，以致产品质量时高时低，安全尚无保证。
