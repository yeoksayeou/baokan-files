Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 18th: The rent reduction movement in Yongshun, Yuanling, and Huitong three special districts of western Hunan Province, including Yongshun, Yuanling, Baojing, Xupu, Huitong, and other sixteen counties, has been generally launched. As of early September, among the 2,313 townships in the sixteen counties, 2,029 townships have carried out anti-local tyrant and rent reduction activities, and farmers have received over 11 million catties of rent grain that landlords should have returned according to law. Currently, the anti-local tyrant and rent reduction movement of farmers in this area, combined with the reasonable burden movement in the collection of autumn agricultural taxes, is continuing to expand.

The three special districts of Yongshun in western Hunan govern a total of twenty-two counties. When farmers in various parts of Hunan rose up to reduce rent this spring, the rent reduction movement in the counties of western Hunan was not launched due to the severity of banditry, and various rural works also stagnated. At that time, only some districts and townships in individual counties reduced rent, but the reduction was not thorough. During May and June this year, various counties in western Hunan strengthened the work of suppressing bandits. With the victory of bandit suppression, farmers rose up to reduce rent one after another. During July and August, the rent reduction movement gradually expanded and spread to sixteen counties. The remaining six counties, including Fenghuang, Longshan, and Tongdao, still need to continue suppressing bandits and stabilize rural order.

Now, the awareness of farmers in western Hunan has been significantly improved. They are actively assisting the people's government in eliminating remnant bandits and hidden secret agents in order to further consolidate the rural areas of western Hunan. Recently, farmers in this area have launched a reasonable burden struggle for autumn collection, and have found many black fields concealed by illegal landlords. According to statistics from 289 townships in Huitong Special District, approximately 5,000 mu of black fields were found.

　　湘西普遍展开减租运动
    【新华社长沙十八日电】湖南省西部永顺、沅陵、会同三个专区所属的永顺、沅陵、保靖、叙浦、会同等十六县的减租运动已经普遍展开。截至九月上旬为止，十六个县的二千三百十三个乡中间，已有二千零二十九个乡进行了反恶霸和减租，农民共得到按法令地主应退出的租粮一千一百多万斤。现在，该地区农民的反恶霸、减租运动，结合着征收秋季农业税中的合理负担运动，还在继续扩展。
    湘西永顺等三个专区共辖二十二个县。今春湖南各地农民起来减租时，湘西各县因匪患较严重，减租运动没有展开，各项农村工作也停滞不前。当时，只有个别县的部分区、乡农民起来减过租，但减得也不彻底。今年五、六月间，湘西各县加强剿匪工作。随着剿匪的胜利，农民又纷纷起来减租。七、八月间，减租运动就已逐渐扩大，普及于十六个县。其余凤凰、龙山、通道等六个县，还须继续剿匪，安定农村秩序。
    现在，湘西农民觉悟已经显著提高，他们正积极协助人民政府肃清残匪和暗藏的特务，以便进一步巩固湘西农村。最近该地区农民又开展了秋征的合理负担斗争，查出不法地主所隐瞒的许多黑田，如会同专区的二百八十九乡统计，就查出黑田约五千亩。
