　　Northeast Railway has made significant progress in transportation operations over the past year under the leadership of the Central Ministry of Railways, the Northeast People's Government, the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet experts, the close cooperation of the Party, government, and labor union, and the efforts of all employees. Comparing the actual performance from January to August of last year with January to August of this year: This year, the converted loading volume increased by an average of 58.1 percent per day; freight car turnaround rate shortened from 4.09 days to 3.22 days; and freight locomotive daily car kilometers increased from 339.9 kilometers to 383 kilometers. The number of transportation accidents this year decreased from an average of 21 per 100,000 train kilometers to 10, a reduction of 52.4 percent. Average coal consumption per 10,000-ton kilometers for locomotives decreased from 280.2 kilograms to 225.9 kilograms. On-time operation of passenger trains improved from 87 percent to 99.5 percent, and freight trains from 81.6 percent to 98.4 percent. Over the past year, under the close cooperation of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League, the entire railway system extensively carried out the "Iron Ox Movement," the "500-Kilometer Movement," and the "Rationalization Proposals Movement." The work enthusiasm and creativity of every employee were brought into play. From September of last year to August of this year, the entire railway system (excluding the portion of the China Changchun Railway after May of this year) had 4,541 people awarded merits and 16,712 people received prizes. Due to learning from advanced Soviet experience, Northeast Railway work is further developing. In terms of train operations, a new shunting method has been implemented, shortening the formation and disbandment time at major marshalling stations by 15 to 25 percent, and reducing vehicle dwell time by one hour. The locomotive department has implemented a cyclical maintenance system. Factories have implemented assembly line operations and independent accounting systems. The engineering department has implemented a new track maintenance method. The electrical department has implemented a new maintenance method. This has enabled Northeast Railway to repeatedly overfulfill the state's transportation tasks, playing a certain role in the economic construction of Northeast China and the whole country. This is the glory of all Northeast Railway employees. However, on the other hand, Northeast Railway has not yet established a sound economic accounting system. Although various units have completed their tasks, it is difficult to judge the cost levels. The leadership still has a complacent attitude of "we have done almost enough." This problem has been exposed in the recent rectification and study, and the path to correction has begun to be found.

　　东北铁路工作进步
    运输事故减少装车数目增加
    全路有四千五百余职工立功
    【本报哈尔滨讯】一年来，东北铁路在中央铁道部，东北人民政府领导下，在苏联专家的热诚帮助，党、政、工的密切配合以及全体职工的努力下，运输业务有了显著进步。拿去年一月到八月和今年一月到八月的实际成绩相比较；今年换算装车数，每天平均增加百分之五十八点一，货车周转率由四点零九天缩短到三点二二天，货运机车日车公里由三百三十九点九公里提高到三百八十三公里。今年运输事故件数，每十万列车公里平均由二十一件减少到十件，减少了百分之五二点四。机车用煤每万吨公里平均由二百八十点二公斤，减少到二百二十五点九公斤。旅客列车正点运行由百分之八十七提高到百分之九十九点五，货物列车由百分之八十一点六提高到百分之九八点四。一年当中，在党、政、工、团密切配合下，全路广泛地开展了铁牛运动、五百公里运动、合理化建议运动。发挥了每个职工的工作积极性和创造性，从去年九月到今年八月一年中，全路（不包括今年五月以后中长路部分）有四千五百四十一人立功，一万六千七百十二人得奖。由于学习苏联先进经验，东北铁路工作正进一步地向前发展，车务方面实行了新调车法，在各大编成站编成和解体时间缩短了百分之十五到二十五，车辆停留时间缩短一小时。机务部门实行了循环检修制。厂务方面实行了流水作业法和独立会计制度。工务方面实行了新养路法。电务方面实行了新维修法。这样，就使得东北铁路能一再超额完成国家的运输任务，对于东北和全国的经济建设，起了一定的作用。这是全东北铁路职工的光荣。但在另一方面，东北铁路还没有很好地建立经济核算制度。各单位虽完成了任务，但成本高低如何，很难判断。领导上还存在着“我们已做得差不多”的自满情绪，最近在整风学习中揭发了这个毛病，开始摸到了改正的途径。
