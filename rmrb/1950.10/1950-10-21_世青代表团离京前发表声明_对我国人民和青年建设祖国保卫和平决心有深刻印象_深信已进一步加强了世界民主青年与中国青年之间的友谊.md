Xinhua News Agency, October 20th: The World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation issued the following statement before leaving Beijing:

    The World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation, composed of 42 representatives from 32 countries – including the Soviet Union, People's Democratic countries, and capitalist, colonial, and semi-colonial countries – has completed a 40-day visit to the People's Republic of China.

    On the eve of our departure, the delegates would like to express our warmest gratitude to the Central People's Government of China, to all organizations, and especially to the New Democratic Youth League and the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, who invited us and facilitated our mission during our stay in China.

    Over the past six weeks, our delegation has visited vast areas of mainland China, including the provinces of Northeast, East China, and Central South China. At grand mass rallies in dozens of cities welcoming the delegation, and at numerous meetings organized in factories, villages, schools, and universities, the delegation addressed hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic young people.

    The delegation participated in the grand and solemn ceremony celebrating the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1st.

    Through numerous contacts with Chinese youth, our delegation was able to appreciate the high level of awareness of the Chinese people, who have finally shaken off the oppression of feudalism and imperialism.

    The Chinese people and youth are not intimidated by the provocations of the American imperialists who intend to undermine their victory. We have seen that, under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are firmly determined to liberate Taiwan and Tibet as soon as possible, thereby liberating the entire country. We are also deeply impressed by the fact that the entire Chinese people are closely united around the Central People's Government to rebuild their motherland.

    We deeply felt the spirit of internationalism that inspires Chinese youth to wage a heroic struggle to build the life of their country, and we saw the love of the Chinese people for the great Soviet people and the great Marshal Stalin, the first fighter for peace. We saw their sympathy for the heroic Korean people who are fighting against American imperialist aggression.

    On every occasion, in our contacts with workers, peasants, students, intellectuals, and soldiers, we saw clear evidence of the Chinese people's desire for peace. This desire is proven by the fact that, before our departure from China, 190 million men and women had signed the Stockholm Appeal.

    Chinese workers are engaged in a tremendous work competition, to which they are dedicating all their courage and creativity. The youth are at the forefront. We have seen how quickly they are clearing away the remnants of the destruction caused by the feudal landlords, imperialists, and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek clique over the decades of their rule.

    Tens of thousands of labor heroes are emerging throughout the country. The number of outstanding children of the New China is increasing day by day, making it possible for the Chinese people to look forward to the most glorious future.

    Chinese women's contributions in all aspects of the economy, as well as in political and cultural life, are enormous. This proves what the Chinese revolution has brought to Chinese women, who have been oppressed by feudalism for generations.

    As a result of the Chinese people's great efforts over the past year, the situation of the working people – workers, intellectuals, and peasants – has improved. Since liberation, land reform has been carried out, enabling more than 100 million peasants to obtain land and tools to work with, and opening up the road to a happy life for them.

    In China, we have seen the fraternal and selfless assistance given to the Chinese people by the great socialist country, the Soviet Union. Throughout our journey, we have seen how the Soviet example and experience are helping the Chinese people build a new and happy life.

    Finally, we have seen that the political and cultural level of the Chinese people is greatly improving. The struggle to eliminate illiteracy has made significant progress, and a new culture and art that serves the people has developed.

    After a visit that has been of great educational significance to each of us, we will tell the youth of our respective countries how great the contribution of the youth and people of China is to the common struggle of all the world's people for democracy and peace. We will describe the enthusiasm of the Chinese youth and their vanguard, the New Democratic Youth League, for building their motherland, their unity and courage, and their determination to defend the fruits of victory they have gained at so much cost. We will explain to all the youth the great prospects that are unfolding before the Chinese people and youth today. They have been liberated forever from the shackles of imperialism.

    Before leaving the People's Republic of China, our delegation sent a telegram to the United Nations Organization, requesting the recognition of the Central People's Government as the only true representative of the Chinese people, and to stop all acts of aggression committed by the American imperialists, including repeated violations of Chinese territory and the occupation of the island of Taiwan.

    The World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation calls on the youth of the world to support this proposal and to intensify action against imperialist aggression against China, Korea, Vietnam, and other countries in Asia.

    We are deeply convinced that the visit of the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation to China has further strengthened the friendship between the world's democratic youth and the Chinese youth, which is a new contribution of the World Federation of Democratic Youth to the struggle for peace.

    世青代表团离京前发表声明
    对我国人民和青年建设祖国保卫和平决心有深刻印象
    深信已进一步加强了世界民主青年与中国青年之间的友谊
    【新华社二十日讯】世界民主青年联盟代表团，在离京前发表声明如下：
    由三十二个国家——包括苏联、人民民主国家和资本主义、殖民地及半殖民地国家——的四十二个代表组成的世界民主青年联盟代表团，已在中华人民共和国完成了为时四十天的访问。
    在本团离华前夕，代表们谨向中国中央人民政府，向各团体，特别是向邀请我们而且在本国留华期间尽量便利本团执行任务的新民主主义青年团及中华全国民主青年联合总会致最热烈的感谢。
    六周来我们代表团访问了中国大陆的辽辟的土地，其中包括东北、华东与中南各省。在几十个城市欢迎代表团的盛大的群众集会上，在工厂、乡村、学校与大学组织的许多会议上，代表团对数十万热烈欢迎代表团的青年人讲了话。
    代表团在十月一日参加了庆祝中华人民共和国第一届国庆日的伟大庄严的典礼。
    在与中国青年的多次接触中，我们代表团能够体会到中国人民的高度觉悟性，他们终于摆脱了封建主义和帝国主义的压迫。
    中国人民及青年并没有为意图破坏他们胜利的美帝国主义者的挑衅吓倒。我们看到，中国人民在中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东的指导下，坚定地决心要尽速解放台湾和西藏，从而使全国都获得解放。全中国人民紧密地团结在中央人民政府的周围进行他们祖国的再建设，这一点也给了我们深刻的印象。
    我们深深感到那鼓舞中国青年为建设他们国家的生活而进行英勇斗争的国际主义精神，我们看到中国人民对伟大的苏联人民及第一位和平战士斯大林大元帅的热爱。我们看到他们同情正在为反对美帝国主义侵略而战的英勇朝鲜人民的情感。
    在每一个场合，在我们与工人、农民、学生、知识分子和兵士们接触中，我们看出了中国人民愿望和平的明证。这种愿望由下面的事实得到证明：在我们离开中国前，一亿九千万男女们已在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名。
    中国工人们正从事巨大的工作竞赛，他们对它献出了一切勇气和一切创造精神。青年们则站在最前列。我们看见他们多么快地在清除由于封建地主、帝国主义者和他们的走狗蒋介石集团的统治数十年来所造成的破坏的遗迹。
    成千成万的劳动英雄正在全国涌现出来。新中国的优秀儿女的数目正在日益增多中，他们使中国人民有可能瞻望最光辉的将来。
    在经济的各个方面以及在政治与文化生活上，中国妇女的贡献是非常巨大的。这证明了中国革命替历代受到封建主义的压迫的中国妇女带来了什么。
    由于中国人民一年来巨大努力的结果，首先便是劳动人民——工人、知识分子与农民的情况改善了。自从解放以来，就一直在进行土地改革，已经使得一亿以上的农民获得了土地与用以工作的工具，并为他们开辟了走向幸福生活的道路。
    在中国，我们看到伟大社会主义国家——苏联给予中国人民的兄弟般的无私的帮助。在我们的全部旅程中，我们看到苏联的榜样和经验怎样地在帮助中国人民建设新的幸福的生活。
    最后，我们看到中国人民的政治和文化水平正在大大提高中。肃清文盲的斗争已有显著的进展，为人民服务的新文化和新艺术也有了发展。
    在经过了一次对我们每个人都有很大教育意义的访问后，我们将告诉我们各国的青年，中国的青年和人民对于整个世界人民争取民主与和平的共同斗争，贡献是如何地巨大。我们将描述中国的青年及其先锋队新民主主义青年团对于建设他们祖国的热忱，描述他们的团结一致和勇敢精神，他们决心来保卫他们花了这么多代价得来的胜利成果。我们将向所有的青年说明，今天展开在中国人民与青年面前的伟大的远景。他们已永远地从帝国主义桎梏下解放出来。
    在我们离开中华人民共和国之前，我们代表团向联合国组织发出一份电报，要求承认中央人民政府是中国人民的惟一真正代表，并且制止美帝国主义者所犯的一切侵略行为，包括一再侵犯中国领土和占领台湾岛。
    世界民主青年联盟代表团吁请全世界的青年支持这个建议，并加紧行动，反对帝国主义侵略中国、朝鲜、越南及亚洲其他国家。
    我们深信：世界民主青年联盟代表团的访问中国，已进一步加强了世界民主青年与中国青年之间的友谊，这是世界民主青年联盟对于争取和平的斗争所作的新的贡献。
