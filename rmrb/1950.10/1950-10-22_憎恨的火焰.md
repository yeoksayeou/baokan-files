　　Flames of Hatred
    By Jin Changwu ① Translated by Zhang Xianxiang
    Dandelion flowers bloom on the ridges of rice paddies,
    An American bomber has broken its wings;
    Next to the plane, a corpse seems to be repenting,
    Lying face down, its nose buried in the soil.
　
    We Korean people,
    Have always been particularly lenient towards the dead
    — Never speaking ill of them.
    But for you —
    American pilot Maurice Olheiser!
    I must
    Spit fiercely on your corpse!
　
    You insulted our lovely, beautiful blue sky,
    You defiled our sacred land,
    We will repay tooth for tooth, eye for eye!
　
    You have already lost the feeling of pain,
    But I can never forgive you!
    Our compatriots were struck down by your bullets,
    They suffered greatly…
    But your filthy corpse shall suffer a hundredfold!
　
    The mothers, wives, and children of the
    Slaughtered Korean people shed tears;
    And your mother, wife, and children,
    Their tears shall flow a hundredfold!
　
    In the Western Hemisphere are your mother and wife,
    Let them think of you, crossing the Pacific to this Eastern Hemisphere,
    Your corpse lying horizontally on foreign soil;
    And crows circling over your head.
　
    Let your children,
    Every time they think of their father as a robber,
    Invading another's land; killed by others,
    Immediately blush with shame!
　
    Even though blood has drained from your stiff corpse,
    I can never forgive you!
    Because due to your provocation, the civil war broke out.
    Korean people shed blood…
    And your blood shall flow a hundredfold!
　
    American pilot Maurice Olheiser!
    Although you are already dead,
    However, I can never forgive you!
    Let this endless flame of hatred
    Burn your corpse to ashes, to ashes!

　　憎恨的火焰
    金常午作①  张显相译
    蒲公英花在稻田埂上开放着，
    一架美国轰炸机被摔断了翅膀；
    飞机旁边一个尸体像是在忏悔，
    俯卧着，鼻子插进土里。
　
    我们朝鲜人民，
    向来对于已死的人特别宽大
    ——决不说他的坏话。
    然而对于你呢——
    美国的飞行士毛里斯·奥利瑟呀！
    我可要对你的尸体
    狠狠地吐上一口唾沫！
　
    你侮辱了我们的可爱的美丽的青空，
    你玷污了我们的神圣的国土，
    我们要以牙还牙，以眼还眼！
　
    你早已失掉了疼痛的感觉，
    但我决不能饶恕你！
    我们的同胞被你的枪弹打倒，
    他们受尽了痛苦……
    在你的肮脏尸体上却要痛苦百倍！
　
    被屠杀的朝鲜人民的
    母亲、妻子和儿女都流着眼泪；
    而你的母亲，妻子和儿女们
    眼泪却要流到百倍！
　
    在西半球上有你的母亲和妻子，
    让他们想到，你过了太平洋到这东半球上，
    把尸体横卧在异国的土地上；
    而乌鸦正在你的头上盘旋。
　
    让你的儿女们，
    每想到自己的父亲作了强盗，
    侵略别人的国土；被人家打死，
    马上就会烧得脸红！
　
    尽管从你僵硬的尸体中血已流尽，
    但我决不能饶恕你！
    因为由于你们的挑拨，爆发了内战。
    朝鲜人民流了鲜血……
    而你们的血却更要流到百倍！
　
    美国的飞行士毛里斯·奥利瑟呀！
    虽然你已经死了，
    然而，我决不能饶恕你！
    让这无限的憎恨的火焰
    把你的尸体烧尽，烧尽！
