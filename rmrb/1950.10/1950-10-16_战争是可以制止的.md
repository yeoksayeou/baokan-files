　　War Can Be Stopped
    Ding Chaowu
    American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan, aggression against Korea, and widespread launching of armed intervention in Asia, appears on the surface to be a display of its strength. In reality, it is precisely the opposite, indicating its weakness and incompetence. The economic crisis within the United States is like a volcano that will erupt sooner or later. In order to delay the time of the eruption, it is forced to embark on the path of aggression, a path it knows is a risky road to death. Chairman Mao once said: "American imperialism is powerful, but at the same time it is weak. It is necessary to understand its powerful nature and its weak nature. American imperialism bears a heavy and difficult burden! It has to assist reactionaries all over the world. If it cannot support them, then the building standing on a shaky pillar will collapse." The experience of the liberation war in mainland China in the past and the current Korean liberation war proves that Chairman Mao's words are absolutely correct. American imperialism is just a paper tiger, seemingly terrifying, but in reality, there is nothing to fear. A small handful of aggressors within American imperialism only estimate the power of weapons when it comes to war. How far can a cannon shoot? How many people can an atomic bomb kill? But what they don't estimate is the power of the people. They simply do not understand the greatness of the people's power. Chairman Mao once asserted: "The real power does not lie in the reactionaries, but in the people." Why did the Soviet Union shatter the armed intervention of fourteen capitalist countries in 1922? It was because of the power of the people. Why were we able to drive out American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek gang in mainland China? Why has the young Korean People's Army continued to achieve great victories in Korea? It is also due to the power of the people. The power of the people is invincible. It is enough to defeat the power of any new type of weapon.
    Now, all the Chinese people have closely united, and the people of the world have closely united, united around the socialist country of the Soviet Union, forming a powerful and unparalleled peace and democracy camp, resolutely resisting the aggression of the imperialist camp headed by American imperialism. The strength of the peace camp is growing day by day, especially the world-historical victory of the Chinese people's revolution. This makes the American-led aggression group feel panic, inferior to one another, and unable to stop trembling in the face of this mighty force for peace.
    Peace is precious, but peace is not complacency and cannot be obtained through begging. The aggressors will not bestow it upon us with a compassionate attitude. Peace must be won with blood and sweat. Now, from the coast of the English Channel to the Japanese archipelago, from the coast of the Bering Strait to Australia, millions of peace-loving people are fighting to oppose war and defend peace. Hundreds of millions of people around the world have signed the peace appeal. Although the warmongers are creating new wars and instigating new wars, war can be stopped due to the strength of the peace forces.

　　战争是可以制止的
    丁超五
    美帝侵略台湾、侵略朝鲜，在亚洲广泛地发动了武装干涉。从外表上看来，这是它强大的表现。其实却恰恰的相反，这表示了它的衰弱和无能。美帝国内经济危机，像一座火山迟早要爆发的。为了要延缓爆发的时间，逼得它不能不走上侵略之路，而这条路，它自己也知道，是一条冒险的死亡的路。毛主席曾经说过：“美帝国主义是强大的，但同时是虚弱的。需要了解它的强大的性质，和它的虚弱的性质。美帝国主义担负着艰难的重荷！它得援助全世界的反动分子。如果它不能支持它们，那么架在一根动摇的柱子上的建筑物便会倒塌下来。”过去中国大陆解放战争和现在朝鲜解放战争的经验，证明了毛主席的话是绝对正确的。美帝是只纸老虎，看来样子可怕，实在并没有什么可怕，美帝内部一小撮侵略分子，他们对战争，只会估计武器的力量，一个平炮能够射多少远？一个原子弹能炸死多少人？但他们不会估计的，是人民的力量。他们根本不懂得人民力量的伟大。毛主席曾经断定：“真正的力量并不在反动派，而在于人民。”一九二二年，苏联为什么会粉碎十四个资本主义国家的武装干涉，这是由于人民的力量。在中国大陆，我们为什么能够把美帝国主义及其走狗蒋匪帮赶了出去？在朝鲜，年青的人民军为什么会不断取得伟大的胜利，这同样是由于人民的力量，人民的力量是无敌的。它足以战胜任何新式武器的威力。
    现在，全中国人民已经密切地团结起来，全世界人民已经密切地团结起来，团结在社会主义国家苏联的周围，组成了强大无比的和平民主阵营，坚决反抗以美帝为首的帝国主义阵营的侵略。和平阵营的力量一天天壮大起来，特别是中国人民革命获得了世界性和历史性的胜利。这使美帝为首的侵略集团觉得恐慌，相形见拙，而不能不在这浩浩荡荡的和平力量前面发抖了。
    和平是可贵的，但和平并不是苟安，不能用求乞得来。侵略者也不会以慈悲的态度恩赐给我们，和平是要用血汗争取得来的。现在，从英吉利海峡的海岸到日本三岛，从白令海峡沿岸到澳大利亚，千百万爱好和平的人民正在为反对战争保卫和平而斗争。全世界已有几亿人民在和平呼吁书上签名。战贩们虽然在制造新的战争，挑拨新的战争，但由于和平力量的强大，战争是可以制止的。
