　　Ren Zhangyuan and Three Landlords
    Wei Jinzhi
    Editor's Note: Ren Zhangyuan is a model worker in water conservancy in East China. He is the director of the Yejiacun Farmers' Association and the Water Conservancy Committee in Quzhou, Zhejiang. Under his leadership, the masses built an important dike, preventing 178,000 mu of paddy fields from being flooded. Writer Wei Jinzhi visited Ren Zhangyuan during her trip to Beijing with the East China Model Worker Delegation. This article records Ren Zhangyuan's past experiences of being oppressed by landlords. It is a beautiful interview.
    Ren Zhangyuan, the old man, is very talkative. After talking about his water conservancy work, he talked about land reform; because he talked about land reform, he talked about the three landlords who had exploited him:
    "Landlords, you say how terrible they are! They are always connected to us, always exploiting us.
    "Ever since the Japanese burned my house, my old woman (old woman, referring to his wife – editor's note) had nowhere to settle down, living here for a few days and there for a few nights, just like a beggar. We always thought: we must build a thatched hut, even if it's as small as a birdcage. Relying on a carrying pole alone, you can only manage three meals a day, not a place to sleep.
    "Although we didn't have money to build a house, I always kept thinking about it. Thinking about it, I finally noticed a place. Not far away, right next to the pier, with a river on one side and a road on the other, a place called Kuixingping. There was a graveyard there, and besides a few graves, it was just a large wasteland, piled with dead cats, dead dogs, broken bricks and tiles. If you moved these away, it would be perfect for building a shack. I thought: if we built a shack, the old woman could set up a stall at the door, selling tea and firewood, and it would be convenient for me to carry loads at the pier. It was really a good place.
    "Upon inquiring, it turned out to be the land of the Kong family. I only recognized one person from the Kong family, Kong Jianqing. He was a bankrupt landlord. I often ran into him at the pier, so I recognized him. When I asked, it just happened to be his family's. We agreed on three dou of grain as a deposit and three dou of grain as annual rent. I also agreed to look after the graves for him, and he also agreed to let me cultivate some wasteland to grow vegetables.
    "After agreeing on the lease, I borrowed some money from my elder sister in Longyou County and bought some bamboo, wood, and rice straw. Then, the old woman and I first removed the waste and leveled the foundation. Then, the old woman carried mud, and I built the walls. It was a bit hard, but when I thought about having a new house, having my own home, my hands and feet didn't feel sore, and my back straightened up. In this way, we finally built two small thatched huts. It was so good, I slept especially soundly and sweetly at night.
    "After building the house, we started cultivating the wasteland to grow vegetables. While we were working, I saw a man in a long gown, with his hands behind his back, walking back and forth on the road. Every time he passed, he would look at me with a smile. I thought: something's not right, I don't know him, and he looks like a rich man. It's common for them to put on a stern face for poor people, so a smile is a bit suspicious. Sure enough, after we had cultivated two furrows of land, this person came again. This time, he didn't smile, but put on a stern face and moved his chin, saying: 'Hey, what's your name, you limping fellow? Do you know whose land this is?' I thought: what am I afraid of, I have a lease in my hand. I told him my name and also told him that I had leased it from Kong Jianqing.
    "He said: 'No, this land is mine.' I said: 'Kong Jianqing said it's cemetery property, and he's in charge of the cemetery accounts; moreover, I've already signed a lease with him, and I've already paid six dou of grain; if you want to settle accounts, you go settle accounts with Kong Jianqing.' He said: 'You pay your rent, what does that have to do with me. Even if it's cemetery property, if Kong Jianqing can rent it out, can't I, Kong Zhangfu, rent it out? Let me tell you, if you know what's good for you, the land is mine. That poor wretch has already taken your rent, I'm just unlucky. Let's discuss it, let's say he took last year's, and I'll take this year's.' I said: 'We agreed on an annual rent, and it's not due yet, so how can you come to collect rent again?' He said: 'Since that's the case, I'll sue you. The land deed is in my hand, can't I sue you? If you don't go to jail, how would you be willing to pay rent!'
    "I ran to Kong Jianqing and said: 'Who is ultimately in charge of this land? You took my rent, and Kong Zhangfu came to collect rent again, what should I do?' Kong Jianqing said awkwardly: 'That's right, I'm in charge of the accounts, but he's hiding the land deed.' I said: 'So I have to pay two years' rent in one year?' Kong Jianqing didn't say anything, and only after a long time did he say: 'To save trouble, just pay for this year and next year. He's a mean ghost, and he has tricks in his belly, can you outsmart him?' I said: 'You're saying that so lightly, you took my rent, but you're not helping me, and you're even trying to persuade me. I just can't pay; if I could pay, it wouldn't matter if I paid for ten years. Besides, what if a third person named Kong comes to collect rent?' He swore an oath, saying: 'No, if anyone else comes to collect rent, you can ask me, Kong Jianqing.'
    'What to do? Whose land it is, and to whom to pay rent, I don't understand; it's not my land, that's for sure. I discussed it with the old woman: moving the bricks and tiles, the soil is all black, good for growing vegetables and wheat, it's a pity to lose this land. Building a house, then tearing it down to return the land, is even more of a pity. Thinking about the suffering of wandering before, we were unwilling to return the land no matter what. Besides, renting land elsewhere would still cost money, and if it costs the same, it's better to pay a little more here. Thinking like this, my heart softened again.
    "I had already discussed it with myself, but I was afraid that another person named Kong would come, and there would be another extortion. Because I wanted to make it solid, we thought of a way: as long as there is a land deed, the one with the land deed must be the real landlord; since Kong Jianqing is in charge of the accounts, he should also put his mark (signature — editor's note). As long as we can do it, we will sign a contract.
    "I first asked Kong Jianqing: 'Is this method good?' Kong Jianqing agreed. He said: 'As long as Kong Zhangfu agrees, I have no problem.'"
    "I ran to Kong Zhangfu and said: 'I am willing to lease it, but I want to see your land deed.' He didn't say whether he had a land deed, but asked me how much rent I was willing to pay. I said: 'Just like Kong Jianqing, not counting the deposit, I'll pay three dou of annual rent.' He said: 'Three dou? That's not even enough for my labor to open the deed box. Besides, the land is mine, and Kong Jianqing even collected a deposit, why shouldn't I collect a deposit? You don't recognize your own father, but you recognize your uncle, you're out of your mind! Let me tell you, the deposit is two dan, and the annual rent is two dan, not a single grain less. If you want less, you can tear down the house! And let me tell you, give me back everything you moved, and fill in the land you cultivated. I'm not greedy for this cheap deal.'
    "Four dan, where would I get four dan of grain? I didn't dare to agree. I said: 'How about six dou, just like Kong Jianqing!' He still didn't agree.
    "I, on the other hand, kept adding one dou at a time. Adding one dou was like cutting off a piece of flesh, and my heart ached. To be honest, I really didn't have any money. I always thought about what I could sell for one dou of grain, and then I would add one dou of grain. Adding one dou at a time was like moving the quilt and clothes out of the house one by one. However, I moved things out one by one, but he wouldn't reduce the amount by a single dou. He just shook his head and didn't say a word. I kept adding until one dan and five dou, and I couldn't add any more. Only then did he agree to reduce it to two dan. But he said: 'Two dan, not a single grain less.'
    "Even though we agreed on two dan, I really didn't have any confidence. After scraping together here and there for a while, it still wasn't enough. Although it was already cold, I still had to pawn the cotton quilt to make up the amount. I thought that having a house, even if I didn't have a quilt, would be warmer than sleeping in the open air. So I went to Kong Zhangfu's house to see the land deed.
    "Looking at the land deed was naturally just an empty gesture. I only recognized my own name, and I learned that while working on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. He also guessed that I was putting on an act, so he deliberately put a large pile of land deeds in front of me and told me to recognize them myself. I picked for a long time, but I just made a fool of myself. In the end, Kong Zhangfu picked out an old mulberry paper deed for me and read it to me. But since I couldn't recognize the words, it was like a Taoist priest catching ghosts, who knows what tricks he's playing.
    "After paying the rent grain, I could finally live in the thatched hut with some stability, and the vegetable garden was finally planted, but it was already the end of the year. There was no business at the stall, and there was no business at the pier. I suffered and saved, and only redeemed a few cotton clothes. The cotton quilt was still in the pawnshop for the New Year. Not only was my body cold, but my stomach was also not full. I could only drink two bowls of thin porridge every day. Unexpectedly, it never rains but it pours. A heavy rain, followed by a heavy snow, collapsed one side of the mud wall. When it collapsed, I had to rebuild it; but the mud was rotten and couldn't be rebuilt on rainy days, the mud was frozen and couldn't be rebuilt on cloudy days, and even when it cleared up, it still couldn't be rebuilt. It had to be sunny for a long time, but I couldn't wait for a long sunny day.
    "Until the second month of the lunar calendar, I finally broke my hands from the cold and rotted my feet before repairing the mud wall. Even though it was repaired, I don't know how much blood and how many tears seeped into the mud wall. But unexpectedly, the third bastard named Kong came again.
    "This Kong Rongshou was even more fierce than Kong Zhangfu, and he had even more power. He ran two large pharmacies, and the judge of the court lived in his house. He called me over and didn't say anything else, just told me to tear down the house and return the land. If I didn't tear it down, he wanted six dan of grain, three dan as a deposit and three dan as annual rent. I also got angry (enraged—editor's note) and said: 'I paid rent to Kong Jianqing, and then Kong Zhangfu came; I paid rent to Kong Zhangfu, and then Kong Rongshou came; how many people are there named Kong? Who is the real landlord?' He said: 'You're asking who the real landlord is? Let me tell you, we are six cousins, and we all have a share. Kong Jianqing managed the accounts, and Kong Zhangfu hid the land deed, that's all correct, but now this land has been merged with mine, and only I have the right to collect rent. I don't care about what others collect.' I said: 'I've already paid the rent, I can't pay any more. If you have a land deed, go sue me!' He said: 'Of course I have a land deed, do you think I don't have a land deed? What a joke.'
    "I thought: there can only be one land deed, there can't be two land deeds. If he doesn't have a land deed, how can he sue me. But I was still a little suspicious, so I went to ask Kong Zhangfu. Kong Zhangfu said: 'Of course there is only one land deed, but this land has been passed down from our ancestors for I don't know how many years, how could there still be a land deed.' I came back and discussed it with a few friends, and everyone said: since you've already paid the rent, and you have a lease, and Kong Rongshou doesn't have a land deed, he's just scaring you, what are you afraid of him for? I also thought: anyway, I'm a bare egg, so I'll fight them. So, I ignored them.
    "Landlords really have ways, in just two or three days, the summons came. In the first hearing, I submitted both leases, and insisted that Kong Jianqing and Kong Zhangfu had collected my land rent. I also said: they are all brothers, and since they collected the rent, they should offset some of it. The judge said with a smile: 'Since it is Kong Rongshou's land, naturally Kong Rongshou should collect the rent. Kong Jianqing collected your rent, but now the lease has expired, so that doesn't matter; only the rent that Kong Zhangfu collected hasn't expired. If you want Kong Zhangfu to return the rent, you can submit a complaint to sue him, and I will tell him to return it to you, but it cannot be deducted from Kong Rongshou.'
    "I thought: could it be that this land really merged with Kong Rongshou's? So I went to ask Kong Zhangfu. Kong Zhangfu said: 'Bullshit! It's true that the land was merged with him, but it was agreed in advance: the rent that has been collected is considered collected and is not counted in. If you want me to go to court, I can confront him face to face.'
    "With Kong Zhangfu's guarantee, and the judge also spoke very kindly, I thought I had more confidence, so I submitted another defense. In the second hearing, Kong Zhangfu and Kong Rongshou really argued. Whether it was a fake play or not, no one understood their inside story. But that judge changed his face, didn't allow me to speak, picked up his pen and judged, saying that I had forcibly occupied the land and ordered me to tear down the house and return the land within twenty days. I wanted to defend myself, but he turned around and left.
    "What to do? Some friends said: 'That's outrageous, might as well appeal to Jinhua!' Some friends said: 'It's useless, let's gather together and beat him up, and see if he still dares to tear down the house!' That's right, appealing to Jinhua requires money, where would I get money? Beat them up, the reactionary government is arresting people everywhere, I can't just go up to him and let him shoot me. There was no way, I could only think of a way to delay, on the one hand, I asked people to intercede, and on the other hand, I went to Jinhua for two hearings.
    "After that, Hangzhou had not yet been liberated, the reactionaries only cared about Hangzhou, and they didn't know that the People's Liberation Army had copied them from behind, and in one fell swoop, Quzhou was liberated."
    Speaking of this, this water conservancy model worker narrowed his eyes and laughed loudly. He took down the bamboo pipe on his neck and puffed and puffed on the damp tobacco. He inhaled the smoke into his mouth, inhaled a lot, and for a long time, then opened his mouth, and the smoke, the grievances, combined into a three- or four-foot-long smoke dragon, rolled out.
    "Now," I asked him, "have you settled accounts with them?"
    "No!" he replied.
    "Why not? These hateful landlords!"
    "I'm too busy! I have to manage eight administrative villages and thirty-four farmers' associations. Pest control, water conservancy, running cooperatives, one thing after another. Just repairing the Shibao Weir cost 15,000 workdays. I am the director of the county's water conservancy committee, and I have to be there in person to lead the way. Originally, there were twelve working cadres, but after streamlining, nine were streamlined. Only three people were left, and one still had eye problems. Besides, I also study culture. I went to night school last month, and I already recognize more than a hundred characters."
    "Then, do you still remember the pain of using your quilt to build the mud wall?"
    "How could I not remember? This kind of suffering can never be forgotten. It's just that compared to settling accounts and work, work is naturally more important. Also, the government is our own, if we have a good reason, we won't be unable to explain it, and we're not afraid of these landlords running away, so what am I in a hurry for?
    "Anyway, I've hidden all the evidence, we will have a day to settle accounts."
    I said: "That's right, we will use land reform to settle the overall account. After land reform, the landlords will no longer be able to make trouble.
    "Quzhou, isn't it also having land reform this year?"
    He nodded, and smiled even more happily, his whole face wrinkled up with laughter. Then he said: "You don't know, I also adopted a beggar as my son, and my old woman took a niece from her family to be his wife. You don't know, my old woman is also a poor widow, twelve years older than me, and we are like a young couple, coming together halfway. Now, my old woman jokes: 'Okay, you do your thing, we'll still plant a little bit of land, set up a stall, carry loads, we don't need you to manage the family.' I also said: 'Okay, I will also make our big family even better!'"
    We clapped our hands, we all laughed loudly.

　　任樟元和三个地主
    魏金枝
    编者按：任樟元是华东区治水劳动模范，他是浙江衢州叶家村农会主任和水利委员会主任。在他的领导下，群众修筑了一道重要的防堤，使十七万八千亩稻田，没有遭受洪水的灾害。作家魏金枝此次随华东英模代表团来京，在旅途中访问了任樟元。本文记的是任樟元过去受地主压迫的情形。这是一篇优美的访问记。
    任樟元这个老头子非常健谈，谈完了他的治水工作以后，又谈到土改；因为谈到土改，他又谈起曾经剥削过他的三个地主来了：
    “地主，你说多可怕！他们也和我们一样，总是连在一起；都要剥削我们。
    “自从日本人烧了我的房子，我同我的老太婆（老妇人，指他的老婆——编者注），就没处安身，东住几天，西宿几夜，简直像个叫花子。我们总是想：总要扛间草房，那怕鸟笼那么大也好。就是单靠一根扁担，最多只能图个三餐，图不得一宿。
    “虽然没钱造屋，心里总还是想着这件事。想着想着，我到底留心到一个地方了。不远，就在码头边，一面靠河，一面靠大路，土名叫做魁星坪。那里有块坟地，除开几个坟，就是一片大荒地，堆着死猫死狗，碎砖碎瓦。搬脱这些，正好搭个茅篷。我想：搭了茅篷，老太婆就好在门口摆个摊，卖茶水，卖柴火，我到码头上挑担也方便。真是一个好地方。
    “一打听，原来是孔家的地。孔家人，我只认得一个孔鉴清。是个没落地主，常在码头碰着他，就认得了。一问，正好就是他家的。我们就讲定：三斗谷押租，三斗谷年租。我附带给他看坟，他也答应我开点荒地种种菜。
    “订好租约，我就到龙游县阿姊家里借了点钱，买了些竹木稻草。就同老太婆先把废料搬开，地基填平。再是老太婆畚泥土，我筑墙。苦是苦一点，一想到造好新屋，就有一个自己的家，手脚也不酸了，腰骨也挺直了。就这样，到底造好两间小茅屋。真好，夜里睡觉也睡得特别熟，特别香。
    “造好了屋，我们又动手开荒地种菜。正在动手，我就看见一个穿长衫的，背着手，老在大路上走来走去。一走过，总是笑眯眯的看看我。我想：不对，我又不认得他，他又是个有钱的光景，对穷人板脸孔，是常事，笑眯眯，就有些蹊跷。果然，正好开了两楞地，这个人又来了。这次，他不笑眯眯了，对我板起脸孔，动动下巴说：‘嗳，你这个跷脚叫什么名字？你晓得这块地是那家的？’我想：我怕什么，我手里有租约。我就把我的名字告诉他，也把向孔鉴清承租的话告诉他。
    “他说：‘不成，这块地是我的。’我说：‘孔鉴清说是茔产，他是管茔帐的；而且我和他已经订了租约，我已经交过六斗谷；你要算帐，你向孔鉴清算去。’他说：‘你交你的租，管我什么事。就算是茔产，他孔鉴清租得，我孔章福就租不得？告诉你，你识相些，地是我的，穷骨头已经收了你的租，算是我倒霉，我们来商量，就算他收去年的，我收今年的。’我说：‘我们订的是年租，还没有满期，你怎么又来收租？’他就说：‘既然这样，我就告你。地契在我手里，我还不能告你？不坐牢，你那肯出租！’
    “我就跑去和孔鉴清说：‘这块地终究是那个管的？你收了我的租，孔章福又跑来收租了，怎么办？’孔鉴清尴尬的说：‘不错，帐是我管的，地契是他藏的。’我说：‘那么我就一年出两年的租？’孔鉴清不开口，老半天才说：‘为得省事，你就付今年到明年的。他是个刻薄鬼，肚子里又有鬼计，你弄得过他？’我说：‘你倒说得风凉，收了我的租，不帮我，还来劝我。我就是付不出；付得出，付个十年也不要紧。再说，第三个姓孔的又来收租怎么办？’他就罚咒赌愿的说：‘不会，再有别人来收，你问我孔鉴清。’
    ‘怎么办呢？土地是那个的，又向那个付租，我都不明白；不是我的土地，总是真的。我就和老太婆商量：搬了砖瓦，全是黑土，种菜种麦都好，丢了这块地可惜。造了房子，再拆屋还基，更加可惜。想想以前流荡的苦处，就随便怎样都舍不得还地。再说，到别处租地，也还是要出钱，同样出钱，还不如在这上面多出几个。这样一想，心又就软下来了。
    “自己是商量好了，只怕再来一个姓孔的，再来一笔竹杠。因为想做得牢靠，我们就想好法子：只要有地契，有地契的一定是真地主；孔鉴清既然是管账的，也要叫他着花字（画押—编者注）。只要办得到，我们就订约。
    “我就先问孔鉴清：‘这个办法好不好？’孔鉴清答应了。他说：‘只要孔章福肯，我就没问题。”
    “我就跑去对孔章福说：‘我愿意承租，不过我要看看你的地契。’他不说他有没有地契，倒问我肯出多少租。我说：‘就照孔鉴清的样，押租付过了不算，再付三斗年租。’他说：‘三斗？做我翻契箱的手工钱也不够。再说，地是我的，孔鉴清还收押租，我为什么不收押租？亲爹不认，你去认晚叔，你昏了头！告诉你，押租两担，年租两担，一颗也少不得，要少，你就拆屋吧！再告诉你，搬了的东西也给我还原，开了的地也给我填平。我不贪你这个便宜。’
    “四担，那里来的四担谷？我那敢答应。我说：‘也是六斗吧，照孔鉴清的样！’他还是不答应。
    “我呢，总是一斗一斗的添，添一斗就譬如割了一块肉，心里痛一阵。老实说，真的没有钱，我总是想好了什么可以卖一斗谷，就添一斗谷。一斗一斗的添，就譬如把家里的被头衣服一件一件往外搬。但是，我是一件一件往外搬，他却一斗也不肯减，他只是摇头，一句话也不说。我一直添到一担五，不能再添了，他才肯让到两担。不过他说：‘两担，一颗也不能再少。’
    “讲是讲定了两担，可真是一点把握也没有。东凑西借了一阵，还是不够，天虽然已经冷了，还是把棉被拿去上当，才凑满了数。以为有了屋，虽然没有被，总比宿在露天下暖和些，这就到孔章福家看地契去了。
    “看地契，自然也只是个空城计。我只认得自己的名字，也还是在浙赣路上做工时学的。他也猜透我是空城计，故意把一大叠地契放在我面前，叫我自己认。我拣了大半天，还不是多出了一个丑。到头来，还是孔章福代我拣出一张古老的桑皮纸，并且读给我听。不过自己认不得字，王道士捉鬼，你知道他捣些什么鬼。
    “付过租谷，茅屋算住稳了，菜地也算种定了，却已经到了年底，摊上没有生意，码头上也没有生意。苦熬硬省，只赎了几件棉衣，棉被还是搁在当店里过年。不但身上冷，肚子也不饱，每天只能喝两碗薄粥。不料屋漏碰到连夜雨，一场大雨，又夹着一场大雪，又把一边的泥墙弄坍了。弄坍了只好再筑；可是落雨天泥烂不能筑，阴天泥冰了也不能筑，才晴的天也还是不能筑，非要长晴不可，长晴天却一径等不到。
    “直到阴历二月，总算冻破了手，冻烂了脚，才把泥墙修理好。修是修理好了，泥墙里不知渗进了多少血，多少眼泪。却不料第三个姓孔的杂种又来了。
    “这个孔荣寿，比孔章福更凶，势力更大。他开着两爿大药房，法院的推事，就住在他家里。他把我叫了去，不说别的，只叫我拆屋还基。不拆，就要六担谷，三担押租，三担年租。我也光火（发怒——编者注）了，我说：‘向孔鉴清付租，又来个孔章福；向孔章福付租，又来个孔荣寿；你们到底有几个姓孔的？到底那个是真地主？’他说：‘你问那个是真地主么？告诉你，我们是六个堂兄弟，都有份。他孔鉴清管过帐，他孔章福藏过地契，都不错，只是现在这块地已经并给我，只有我有权收租，别人收的我不管。’我说：‘我已经付过租，不能再付，你有地契你告去！’他说：‘我自然有地契，你道我没有地契？笑话。’
    “我想：地契只能有一张，不会有两张，没有地契，他那能告我。不过我还有些疑心，我就去问孔章福。孔章福说：‘地契自然只有一张，不过这块地是祖宗传下的，不知道有多少年了，那还会有地契。’我回来和几个朋友一商量，大家都说：你既然付过租，有租契，孔荣寿又没有地契，只是吓吓你，你怕他什么？我也想：反正是光蛋，我就和他们拚一拚。这样，我就不理睬他们了。
    “地主真有办法，才两三天，传票就送来了。第一堂，我把两张租约都交上去，一口咬定孔鉴清、孔章福收过我的地租。还说：他们都是兄弟，既然收过租，总应该给我抵个数。承审的推事就笑眯眯的说：‘既然是孔荣寿的土地，自然应该孔荣寿收租。孔鉴清收过你的租，现在租约满期了，这不管；只有孔章福收的，没满期，你要孔章福还租，你递状子来告他，我叫他还你，但不能在孔荣寿头上扣还。’
    “我想：难道这块地真的并给孔荣寿了？我就去问孔章福。孔章福说：‘放屁！地并给他是真的，不过有言在先：收了的租，算是收了，不计在内。假使你要我到案，我可以当面和他对质。’
    “有了孔章福的保证，推事也说得很和气，我以为更有把握了，就再递上一张答辩。第二堂开审时，孔章福和孔荣寿，也真的辩了一场。是不是假戏真做，谁也不明白他们的内幕。但那个推事却变了脸，不许我说话，提起笔来就判，说我强占土地，限定二十天里拆屋还基。我想答辩，他就返转身走了。
    “怎么办呢？有的朋友说：‘岂有此理，索性到金华上诉去！’有的朋友说：‘没用，我们集起来打他一顿，看他还敢来拆屋！’不错，到金华上诉去，要钱，那里有钱？打，反动政府正在到处抓人，总不能自己凑上去给他枪毙。没办法，只有想法子拖，一面托人去说情，一面还到金华去审了两堂。
    “之后，杭州还没有解放，反动派只顾杭州，那知道解放军却从他屁股后抄了过来，一下子，衢州解放了。”
    说到这里，这位治水模范，就眯细了眼，大声的发笑了。他拿下架在头颈上的竹烟管，嗤噗嗤噗的吸起潮烟来。把烟一口一口的吸进去，吸得很多，过得很长远，然后张开口，把烟，冤气，合成一条三四尺长的烟龙，滚滚的冲了出来。
    “现在，”我问他：“是不是已经向他们算过帐？”
    “没有！”他回答我。
    “为什么呢？这几个可恶的地主！”
    “我忙吓！要管八个行政村，三十四个农会。治虫吓，治水吓，办合作社吓，堆起堆倒的事情。单说修理石宝堰，就花了一万五千个工。我是全县水利委员会的主任，都得亲自到场带头。本来是十二个工作干部，一精简，就精简了九个。只剩了三个人，一个还是有眼病的。此外，我还学文化呢。我上一个月夜学，我已经认得一百多个字了。”
    “那么，你还记起当被头筑泥墙的痛苦么？”
    “怎么不记得？这种苦头，永远也不能忘记。只是拿算帐同工作比起来，自然是工作要紧。还有，政府是我们自己的，有理，不会说不清，更不怕这些地主逃走，我还急什么呢？
    “反正证据我都藏着，我们总有算帐的日子。”
    我说：“不错，我们要用土改来算总帐，土改以后，地主再也不能作怪了。
    “衢州，不也是今年土改么？”
