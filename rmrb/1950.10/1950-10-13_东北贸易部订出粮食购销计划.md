　　Northeast Trade Department Formulates Grain Purchase and Sales Plan
　　[This newspaper's dispatch] According to the Northeast Daily News: In order to welcome this year's bumper harvest and purchase and sell farmers' surplus grain in a planned manner, the Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government has initially formulated a grain purchase and sales plan, which has been approved by the Northeast People's Government.
　　The grain purchase and sales plan of the Trade Department first determines the price ratios of various grains. Taking sorghum as the standard, one jin of sorghum is equivalent to 6.6 liang of soybeans, 7 liang of rice, 1 jin of corn from southern Manchuria, and 1.2 jin of corn from northern Manchuria. In order to encourage farmers to pay attention to improving grain quality, a graded pricing system will be implemented during the purchase, "good grain gets a good price, and high-quality goods get a premium." The purchase price of grain will vary according to the different moisture content of the grain in different seasons, the speed of capital turnover, and the variety. There should also be price differences between regions. Grain companies will sign small contracts with cooperatives based on the purchase situation in various places. The policy of considering both public and private interests will be implemented to encourage private merchants to go to the countryside to purchase grain, and any artificial obstacles to urban and rural trade will be eliminated.
　　The Northeast Grain Company, according to the instructions of the Trade Department, has specifically engaged in various preparatory works.

　　东北贸易部订出粮食购销计划
    【本报讯】据东北日报讯：为迎接今年丰收，有计划地收购和推销农民余粮，东北人民政府贸易部，已初步订出粮食购销计划，并经东北人民政府批准。
    贸易部粮食购销计划中，首先确定了各种粮食比价。以高粱为准，一斤高粱折大豆六两六钱，折稻子七两，折南满苞米一斤，折北满苞米一斤二两。为鼓励农民注意提高粮食质量，收购时将实行分等论价，“好粮好价，货高价出头”。购粮价格，按不同季节中粮食所含水分不同、资金周转快慢及品种不同而有所差别，地区间也应有差价。粮食公司将按各地收购情况，与合作社签订小型合同。贯彻公私兼顾政策，鼓励私商下乡购粮，取消城乡贸易中任何人为障碍。
    东北粮食公司，根据贸易部的指示，已具体从事各种准备工作。
