　　Northeast Federation of Trade Unions Calls on All Workers
    To Respond to the Challenge of Zhao Guoyou's Turning Department of the Automobile Industry and Launch a Patriotic Labor Competition
    [This newspaper report] According to the Northeast Daily, October 27th: The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions sent a letter on the 26th to all workers, model laborers, advanced producers, and trade union workers in the Northeast, calling on them to enthusiastically respond to the revolutionary friendship production competition initiated by Zhao Guoyou's Turning Department of the Third Machine Factory to all workers in the Northeast, to strive to build a strong national defense and economic strength, oppose American imperialism's expansion of the war of aggression, and defend the security of the motherland. The original letter is as follows: Workers, technicians, and staff members of the entire Northeast, model laborers and advanced producers of the entire Northeast, comrades of trade union work of the entire Northeast:
    Zhao Guoyou's Turning Department of the Third Machine Factory in Shenyang has issued a resounding call to you: to resist the American imperialists' expansion of bloody aggression, to defend the motherland, to support the just struggle of the Korean people, and to defend world peace, carry out a friendly battle of labor competition. Their guaranteed conditions are:
    1. Highly develop initiative and creativity, improve output and quality, and complete the production plan ahead of schedule.
    2. Improve technology, strictly abide by technical operating procedures, ensure quality, and eliminate accidents.
    3. Practice strict economy, oppose waste, and implement the economic accounting system.
    4. Improve vigilance, strengthen air defense, anti-espionage, fire prevention, and anti-theft work, protect factories, and stop all sabotage activities by enemy agents.
    5. Continue to strengthen the unity within the working class, give play to the organization and discipline of the working class, resolutely overcome difficulties under any difficult conditions, do not leave work posts, and resolutely complete the tasks assigned by the state. To realize Chairman Mao's instructions: Strive to build a strong national defense force and a strong economic force.
    At the same time, workers in various places have also launched a labor competition to oppose the American robbers' expansion of the war of aggression.
    This is a noble manifestation of the patriotism of our Northeast working class. There is no doubt that Zhao Guoyou's call will immediately receive your enthusiastic response.
    Dear comrades, the two years of peaceful construction in the Northeast, relying on the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, relying on all the workers using their hands and brains, shedding blood and sweat, have overcome all the difficulties imposed on us by American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits. The Northeast working class has already created a good start for the industrial construction of the Northeast, and with the development of production, the lives of the working class and all the people have gradually improved. American imperialism is frantically expanding the war of aggression against Korea, burning the flames of war to our borders, threatening the security of our motherland, and threatening our peaceful life full of bright prospects!
    Faced with the aggression of American imperialism, the Northeast working class will not hesitate to take on the responsibility of strengthening production and defending the motherland!
    The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions calls on you to immediately combine current events with studying and discussing the guarantee conditions of Zhao Guoyou's workshop, propose plans to participate in the competition, and launch patriotic labor competitions between individuals and individuals, groups and groups, workshops and workshops, and factories and factories. To this end, trade unions at all levels should immediately seriously lead and organize this great patriotic movement, convene representative conferences of factories and mines, industries, or cities, and convene representative conferences of production models and advanced producers, mobilizing all workers through the representatives attending the meeting. Trade unions at all levels should also pay attention to correctly leading this movement, preventing temporary rushes, pure physical competitions, and neglecting product quality and machinery.
    Workers comrades! The patriotic action we have launched to oppose the aggression of American imperialism will converge into an invincible force, which will teach the American robbers: the will of the Chinese people cannot be despised, the interests of the Chinese people cannot be harmed, and the People's Republic of China, led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, is sacred and inviolable.
                                            Northeast Federation of Trade Unions
                                            October 26th

    响应赵国有车工部挑战  开展爱国主义劳动竞赛
    【本报讯】据东北日报十月二十七日消息：东北总工会于二十六日致函东北全体职工、劳动模范、先进生产者及工会工作者，号召他们热烈响应第三机器厂赵国有车工部向全东北职工发起的革命友谊的生产竞赛，努力建设强大的国防力量与经济力量，反对美帝扩大侵略战争，保卫祖国安全。原信如下：全东北的工人、技术人员、职员们，全东北的劳动模范、先进生产者们，全东北的工会工作的同志们：
    沈阳第三机器厂赵国有车工部，向你们发出了响亮的号召：为反抗美帝国主义扩大血腥侵略，为保卫祖国，为支援朝鲜人民正义斗争，为保卫世界和平，进行友谊的战斗的劳动竞赛。他们的保证条件是：
    一、高度发挥积极性与创造性，提高产量和质量，提前完成生产计划。
    二、提高技术，严守技术操作规程，保证质量、消灭事故。
    三、厉行节约，反对浪费，贯彻经济核算制。
    四、提高警惕性，加强防空、防特、防火、防盗工作，保卫工厂，制止敌特的一切破坏活动。
    五、继续加强工人阶级内部的团结，发挥工人阶级的组织性与纪律性，在任何困难条件下，坚决克服困难，不离开工作岗位，坚决完成国家交给的任务。以实现毛主席的指示：努力建设强大国防力量，建设强大经济力量。
    与此同时，各地职工也已展开了反对美国强盗扩大侵略战争的劳动竞赛。
    这是我们东北工人阶级爱国主义的崇高表现，赵国有车工部的号召，毫无疑问的，会立刻得到你们热烈的响应。
    亲爱的同志们，东北二年来的和平建设，靠着毛主席和中国共产党的领导，靠着全体职工动手动脑，流血流汗，克服了美帝国主义与国民党匪帮所加在我们身上的一切困难，东北工人阶级已经为东北的工业建设创下良好的开端，并且随着生产的发展，工人阶级与全体人民的生活，也逐步提高。美帝国主义疯狂扩大侵朝战争，把战火烧向我国边疆，威胁我祖国安全，威胁我们和平与充满光明远景的生活！
    面对着美帝国主义的侵略，东北工人阶级会毫不迟疑地担当起加强生产、保卫祖国的责任！
    东北总工会号召你们立即结合时事学习讨论赵国有车间的保证条件，提出参加竞赛的计划，展开个人与个人的，小组与小组的，车间与车间的，厂与厂的爱国主义的劳动竞赛。为此各级工会应即认真领导与组织这一伟大的爱国主义运动，召开厂、矿的，产业的或市的代表会议，召开生产模范与先进生产者的代表会议，经过与会代表把全体职工发动起来。各级工会并应注意正确地领导这一运动，防止突击一时，单纯体力比赛，和不注意产品质量与机器的现象。
    职工同志们！我们为反对美帝国主义侵略而掀起的爱国主义行动，将汇成无敌的力量，它会教训美国强盗：中国人民的意志是不容蔑视的，中国人民的利益是不容危害的，以工人阶级为领导、工农联盟为基础的中华人民共和国是神圣不可侵犯的。            东北总工会
                                            十月二十六日
