Xinhua News Agency, 30th. Apostol, Chairman of the General Confederation of Labor of Romania, sent a telegram on September 28th to congratulate our country on its National Day. The telegram stated: "On the occasion of the National Day of the People's Republic of China, I, on behalf of the more than two million organized working people of Romania, extend fraternal and warm greetings to you. The working people of our country are filled with warm feelings for this festival in China. Because from this moment on, you have begun to walk the path taken by the great October Revolution, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its wise leader Mao Zedong, you have gained the freedom, independence, and the construction of such a pleasant and happy life as it is today. We attach great importance to your victories in defeating the reactionaries and their masters, the British and American imperialists. Your achievements in building a new China in the social, economic, and cultural fields are a huge contribution to the socialist and peaceful camp of the world led by the Soviet Union and the great Stalin. The American imperialists have carried out a despicable war and armed aggression against the heroic Korean people; at the same time, they have conspired to occupy China's territory of Taiwan and barbarously bombed China. Our working people are very angry about this. The working class of the People's Republic of Romania unanimously expresses its deepest feelings to you, hoping that you will achieve complete victory in consolidating and developing the People's Republic of China, and in the struggle to overthrow the remnants of domestic reactionaries and the American political aggressors."

　　罗马尼亚总工会贺电
    【新华社三十日讯】罗马尼亚总工会主席阿波斯多尔于九月二十八日电贺我国国庆。电称：在中华人民共和国国庆纪念日，我以罗马尼亚二百多万有组织的劳动人民的名义，向你们致兄弟般的热烈的敬礼。我们国家的劳动人民，对中国的这一节日，充满着热烈的心情。因为从这时起，你们已开始走向伟大的十月革命走过的道路。并在中国共产党及其英明领袖毛泽东的领导之下，获得了人民的自由，独立以及建设像今天这样愉快幸福的生活。你们对打击反动派及其主子美英帝国主义所获得的胜利，我们非常重视。你们在建设新中国的社会、经济、文化方面的成就，也就是对以苏联及伟大的斯大林领导下的全世界社会主义和平阵营一种巨大贡献。美帝国主义者对英勇的朝鲜人民，进行了卑鄙的战争，作了武装的侵略；同时还阴谋侵占中国的领土台湾并野蛮地轰炸了中国。我们的劳动人民，对这件事非常忿恨。罗马尼亚人民共和国工人阶级对你们一致表示极深的情感，希望你们在巩固和发展中华人民共和国的工作中，在打倒国内反动派残余及美国的政治侵略者的斗争中，获得圆满的胜利。
