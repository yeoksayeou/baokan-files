　　Harbin Christian Groups Send Telegram
　　Angrily Protest U.S. Aggression, Support the Chinese Christian Manifesto
　　[This newspaper dispatch] The Christian groups of Harbin have sent a telegram to this newspaper, expressing their angry protest against the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism and their support for the declaration issued by Chinese Christians. The original telegram is as follows:
　　People's Daily: On August 27th, U.S. imperialism, using its invading Korean air force, intruded into our country's airspace and carried out strafing, causing damage to our people and property. Before this blood debt has been repaid, it once again bombed our Antung (Andong) city on September 22nd, killing and wounding our compatriots. Such barbaric and insane atrocities by U.S. imperialism have aroused the infinite anger of our people. We, the religious groups of Harbin, fully support Foreign Minister Zhou's telegram to the United Nations and the Security Council, lodging a complaint against the U.S. imperialism, and we also fully agree with Foreign Minister Vyshinsky's peace declaration. The United Nations should immediately sanction the U.S. imperialist criminals who threaten world peace and attempt to provoke a new war. Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have already stood up. We must never be bullied by anyone again. Whoever owes the Chinese people a blood debt must repay it. Our religious groups must take practical actions to support the declaration of "The Efforts of Chinese Christianity in the Construction of New China" and launch a signature campaign, uniting closely with the people of the whole country and the people of the world to wage a resolute struggle against the arch-criminal of aggression, U.S. imperialism.
