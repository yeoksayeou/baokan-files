　　Why Can't Atomic Bombs Determine the Outcome of a War?
    World Peace Council Organ - Peace Defender
    Editor's Note: Can atomic bombs really determine the outcome of a war? This is a question many readers have asked to be answered. The World Peace Council's organ, "Peace Defender," published a special issue on the problem of atomic warfare, written by world atomic energy authority Joliot-Curie and others, offering a profound and insightful analysis of atomic weapons. These analyses fully demonstrate that atomic weapons cannot determine the outcome of a war. This journal is reprinting the main parts of Chapter 6 of that special issue, which discusses this question. The title has been added by our editors. The Chinese Committee for the Defense of World Peace has translated the special issue, which will be published by World Knowledge Press as part of the World Knowledge Series.

    Is the atomic bomb a decisive weapon in land warfare?

    Atomic bombs have the following two characteristics: high manufacturing cost (ten to thirty billion francs) and the complete destruction of a small area (approximately five square kilometers). If the aim is to affect the entire country of France, it would require 100,000 atomic bombs – worth two hundred trillion to three hundred trillion francs. Therefore, the dropping of atomic bombs, like other bombs, requires the selection of meaningful targets.

    Regarding the effect on military mobilization: An organized country will certainly have a standing army composed of professional soldiers and conscripted youth. This army and its leaders are dispersed in small units during peacetime; stored military supplies, machine guns, tanks, artillery, and aircraft are all scattered in countless and often concealed small storage areas. No matter how powerful an atomic attack is, it cannot disintegrate the army's command system, cannot destroy military equipment, and cannot prevent large-scale military mobilization.

    On the front lines, for strategic use: There is no need to use such a huge expenditure as an atomic bomb on any land front, regardless of how concentrated manpower and material resources are. If an atomic bomb is dropped on an infantry regiment occupying position 302, it might kill two thousand infantrymen, but it will not harm soldiers hidden in underground trenches or concrete bunkers; these sheltered soldiers can still resist enemy attacks, and another infantry regiment occupies position 302 just two or three kilometers away. Due to radiation, attackers cannot advance for at least several hours. As for dropping an atomic bomb to destroy a few gun emplacements, it is even less worthwhile. Using atomic bombs to attack a column of tanks or aircraft at an airfield is equally unworthy.

    Therefore, the strategic use of atomic bombs is like using a 75mm cannon or a steam hammer to kill a fly; of course, you can kill the fly this way, but no one has ever applied this approach.

    Effects behind the front lines: Is it reasonable to drop an expensive atomic bomb to bomb a bridge? If the bombardier misses by 100 meters, the bridge remains intact, just like the bridges in Japanese cities. Is it reasonable to bomb a train station with an atomic bomb? The bombed station can be restored in two days (although after the bombing of Hiroshima, it took eight days for trains to run again, but at that time the ground was not affected by the surface explosion. In fact, the train station could have been used after only two days). As for using atomic bombs to bomb truck convoys on the highway, that is even more unworthy!

    "We can therefore understand why infantry and artillery are still needed...because they are still the strongest combat force in conventional tactics when invading enemy territory...Armies in enemy countries often have to fight guerrillas...The more sophisticated the technological methods applied by an army, the more vulnerable it is to guerrilla warfare" (R. Chasie iet L. Vigneron, "Atomic Energy, A Bright Future or a Disaster?" pages 90, 91).

    The only possible thing seems to be to cut off the enemy's resources, causing them to die due to the severance of military supply sources. But is this possible?

    Strategic applications of atomic weapons: A country with the will to fight has great flexibility. We can cite the following examples:

    1. France: In 1914, the Germans unexpectedly seized all of northern France and Belgium's coal mines, textile industry, and all steel industry factories within a month. For the Allied Powers, the loss was equivalent to the bombing of a thousand atomic bombs, and in fact, it was more than that, because after the Germans seized these things, they did not destroy them but safely used these mines and factories to produce for themselves. But France, despite losing 60% of its national coal production, still achieved victory in 1918.

    2. The Soviet Union: In 1941, suddenly in one month the Germans annihilated two million well-equipped Soviet troops through encirclement, and then attacked Ukraine, the Donets Basin, a vast territory with 30 million Soviet residents, and a portion of factories, machinery, and farms all fell into German hands.

    Hitler's army was incomparably brutal, even atomic bombs would not have slaughtered more lives, caused more disasters, or weakened more Soviet strength.

    3. Germany: The United States' strategic bombing survey report contains statistics on the weight of bombs dropped by the Allied forces on Germany and its occupied countries. We all know that the estimate of one atomic bomb being equivalent to 3,000 tons of ordinary bombs is reasonable.

    The following are the statistics for bombs dropped:
    Germany: 1.35 million tons – equivalent to 450 atomic bombs.
    German-occupied areas of France: 590,000 tons – equivalent to 150 atomic bombs.
    Other German-occupied countries: 570,000 tons – equivalent to 140 atomic bombs.
    Total: 740 atomic bombs.

    During the strategic bombing process that we often heard reported on the radio, (according to Kaldor's publication in the Economic Research Journal) the development of the German military industry was as follows:
        1940 – 100
        1941 – 101
        1942 – 146
        1943 – 229
        1944 – 285

    The termination of this development trend was indeed timely. It is truly fortunate that the Soviet artillery, tanks, and infantry captured Berlin and shattered Hitler's dreams.

    4. Japan: Germany suffered the equivalent of 750 atomic bombs, while Japan surrendered when it received the second atomic bomb (we now know that the third atomic bomb had not yet been manufactured at that time). What was Japan's situation at that time?

    Germany was defeated, and the whole world was against Japan; the Japanese fleet was sunk by the American fleet; famine was rampant; the oil supply source was cut off, and it was completely blockaded; the air force power was absolutely inferior.

    On August 8th, the Soviet Union, in accordance with previous promises, occupied Manchuria at the highest speed. At that time, the American General Chennault, who commanded Chiang Kai-shek's air force (he did not have the slightest "red" suspicion), declared to the New York Times on August 15th:

    "The Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan was the decisive factor in accelerating the end of the war; even if the atomic bomb had not been dropped, the result would have been the same."

    Japan surrendered because it had no other solution; the use of atomic bombs was just to give American soldiers "face."

    No, atomic weapons are not a decisive weapon in the victory or defeat of a war.

    Since a Germany with concentrated population cities could withstand the equivalent of 750 atomic bombs and still be able to triple its military production at the same time, then we can imagine how many atomic bombs continents as large as the Soviet Union and the United States can withstand.

    Moreover, both the Soviet Union and the United States have atomic bombs, and the disaster is not limited to one side. It is very obvious that the side attacked by atomic bombs will inevitably consider the use of atomic bombs in retaliation as legitimate self-defense: This is just like in the 1914-18 war, the Allied forces also used poison gas and did not commit a crime against humanity in their conscience.

    Since aircraft need to fly thousands of kilometers into enemy territory, only a small portion of the bombs can hit the target. Even if the United States has 500 to 2,000 atomic bombs – which is an absurd estimate, achieving 100% efficiency (which is impossible), the attack on the Soviet Union is still far from being decisive.

    In the first period after the start of the war, industry will inevitably be dispersed to small cities, and, as the Germans had already begun, underground factories will be built. In this way, a large number of atomic bombs will also lose their effectiveness because there are no longer attack targets; the industries of the belligerent countries will be re-established in another way.

    In this way, atomic weapons cannot enable a belligerent country to win the war; atomic weapons are just a powerful supplementary weapon. Infantry is still necessary, and the infantry can still advance.

    The Atlantic Pact was established precisely to provide this absolutely indispensable infantry. The famous American journalist Lippmann bluntly stated in his recent book "The Cold War":

    "It is very obvious that Western European countries will supply a large amount of manpower, and the United States will supply ammunition."

    Atomic Bombs and Naval Warfare

    The situation is different when it comes to naval warfare: warships are very expensive (a cruiser is worth 40 billion francs) and bombing targets are concentrated. Now the question is not using a 75mm cannon to kill a fly, but using a cannonball to kill an elephant. This is more cost-effective.

    The following is a description of the disaster caused by an atomic bomb dropped on a fleet from the report of Goldschmidt, the French official observer sent to Bikini:

    "After the rain, the cruiser Arkansas was gone; the aircraft carrier Saratoga, which was floating 600 meters away, sank after seven and a half hours; three other smaller ships sank immediately. The 40,000-ton Japanese cruiser Nagato sank five days later."

    We must not forget that within a three- or four-kilometer radius, a radioactive rain (this rain does not exist on land) poisoned the ships. Therefore, the personnel on board must be evacuated immediately, otherwise all the people on board will die of anemia within three weeks. Even years later, the Americans still had to submerge the ships left in Bikini, because these ships still had radioactive effects.

    For this reason, the naval convoy system and large-scale fleets all had to be terminated. It is impossible to protect merchant ships from submarine attacks.

    As long as an atomic bomb is dropped in a certain port, it is enough to poison the port. It will not dissipate after several months or several years. Therefore, without ports to moor and repair ships, the entire fleet will inevitably be poisoned. Forty atomic bombs dropped on the coasts of Britain can isolate Britain from the outside world. The domestic industry can remain intact, but it can no longer import raw materials, and the entire nation will fall into famine.

    The Navy will not be able to perform its duties.

    All sea landings will become impossible, because a large number of ships loaded with people and supplies will be completely destroyed by atomic bombs. The following is what the American report (July 1947) said:

    "Undoubtedly, operations like the landing in Normandy in 1944, where large numbers of people and huge amounts of materials are concentrated on a small area of ​​the sea or coast, will at least be extremely risky in the future, if not absolutely impossible."

    A New Kind of War?

    Such a war, with continuous bombing using atomic or other weapons, makes city life impossible. Cities like New York, London, Moscow, and Paris all have the danger of turning into smoke and dust, and all may become large cemeteries burying hundreds of millions of corpses.

    Such a war will not shorten the war period, and cannot stop the massacres on the front lines.

    It also cannot determine the victory or defeat of the war, and atomic weapons cannot determine the length of the war.

    Perhaps one day a biological war will be launched, using super-evil weapons, a new Black Death, a new cholera, a new leprosy, and "denatured" typhoid fever. One day perhaps these weapons will also be able to destroy rural harvests and cause huge famines.

    The war of 1914-18 killed 15 million people, and the war of 1939-45 sacrificed 45 million to 50 million lives.

    How many lives will be sacrificed to put us into a war now?

    "Hydrogen Atomic Bomb"

    Currently, the atomic bomb – which is cruel enough – is the only existing fact.

    However, people are studying using atomic bombs as explosive triggers and surrounding them with a mixture of light elements (which may contain deuterium). This mixture will automatically explode when it is raised to a temperature of nearly one billion degrees by the atomic bomb. This is the so-called hydrogen atomic bomb.

    Until now, it has not been confirmed whether this hydrogen atomic bomb can be manufactured.

    However, if it can be manufactured, the factors for manufacturing hydrogen atomic bombs (light elements and ordinary atomic bombs) are all in the hands of the two major powers, the Soviet Union and the United States.

    If the manufacture of this bomb is indeed realized, its destructive power will inevitably be much greater than that of ordinary atomic bombs. This hydrogen atomic bomb can kill a larger number of city residents. However, it is also much more expensive than ordinary atomic bombs, and it is equally ineffective for attacking troops and dispersed industries, and it cannot determine the outcome of the war in the same way.

    Psychological Warfare

    It is very special that President Truman thought it necessary to talk about the hydrogen atomic bomb; this is the first time in history that an announcement has been made before a weapon is used; and this time it was even announced before the weapon was manufactured.

    Did the Germans tell us in advance before they used poison gas and airplanes? Did we talk about threatening them with tanks in advance? Did the Germans talk about their magnetic mines in advance? Did the British talk about their radar in advance? Did the Germans talk about their V2 rockets? Did Truman give anyone a warning before using the atomic bomb?

    The reason for this propaganda is psychological: in fact, the United States has been engaged in the manufacture of atomic bombs since 1942; but in 1949, the exclusive announcement of atomic bombs ended, international negotiations achieved a considerable balance, and world opinion, supported by the peace movement, moved towards striving for the establishment of an unconditional international agreement to ban atomic weapons. So, under this pressure, President Truman, after the news was broadcast and revealed by Senator Johnson, announced on February 1, 1950, that the United States "continues to work on the manufacture of hydrogen atomic bombs."

    Such news shocked the world and was considered a revelation of evil, which is of course the case; but at the same time, it is very obvious that this propaganda policy is completely unreasonable for the United States - the United States has absolutely no technical and scientific progress in this issue; the United States first threatens the world with hydrogen atomic bombs, and it itself cannot guarantee that it can definitely manufacture the hydrogen atomic bomb first. This is one of the reasons why the announcement of the hydrogen atomic bomb aroused many fierce protests from Americans. (But we remember that during the period of American atomic monopoly, there were very few Americans who protested against atomic bombs.) We can see the reactions of people from all walks of life in the United States in Chapter 7 of this book.

    "Pocket" Atomic Weapons

    After that, another similar message was spread: not giant bombs, but very small bombs. It is said that the United States has successfully manufactured a pocket atomic bomb for strategic use by the army on the front lines.

    Of course, the weight of the accessories of the bullet (such as the shell, detonator) may be reduced, but this is still the same for the cost of manufacturing the entire bullet. Because the cost is mainly determined by the extremely expensive "plutonium."

    We know that "plutonium" must have a certain critical volume to explode. Even if some of the most advanced neutron reflectors are placed around the bullet, we can at most hope to reduce the critical volume of plutonium by a quarter or a third, but no more. Although the cost of the bullet is reduced by a quarter or a third, it is still very expensive; therefore, the target of the bullet can only be something concentrated and of extremely important value.

    Of course, if pocket atomic bombs really exist, then they can enable a weak and demoralized army to advance behind an atomic barrier, just like the infantry in 1944 advanced under the cover of artillery fire. But this fascinating prospect is just a fictitious imagination - this is to comfort those who are preparing for war on the one hand, but are unwilling to be tried one day before an international court (like the Nuremberg Tribunal).

    The hydrogen atomic bomb was originally a weapon of psychological warfare, created to stabilize the psychology of the American masses and to deeply impress the people of Europe. The pocket bomb is also a weapon of psychological warfare, designed to stabilize some people in Europe who support the Atlantic Pact.

    The Illusion of Flying Saucers

    Another weapon of psychological warfare - to maintain a sense of unease among the American masses and gradually create a war psychosis - is the story of flying saucers. It is worrying that there are many people in the United States, some of whom are well-intentioned, who are sure that they have seen these flying saucers (undoubtedly, the flying saucers are of course from the East). In the Middle Ages, many people in France had seen "demons," and many pyres were set on fire by them.

        ★          ★          ★          ★

    In war, before an attack, a barrage of artillery fire is first fired to frighten the enemy and weaken their morale, and then the infantry follows up to attack. Before launching a war, a "psychological preparation" is also needed: that is the announcement of flying saucers, pocket bombs, and giant bombs. We will inevitably see more absurd news in the future, such as the announcement of some mysterious weapons (enough to make mankind succumb to inevitable disasters). However, we must remember that when the artillery fire before the infantry's attack does not work, the troops' offensive needs to be delayed. Now, we can make psychological warfare preparations fail, then the war itself will have to be postponed, and then become impossible.

    What should be done to achieve this goal? We must first recognize where the danger lies, so that we can remain calm and not panic; our nerves must not be shaken. All of us who feel indignant at the nameless terror of atomic war must become true peace defenders - each of us must be able to explain to our neighbors and friends and make them understand the position they should take, which is what the Stockholm Appeal urgently requires of us.

　　原子弹为什么不能决定战争的胜负？
    世界保卫和平大会委员会机关刊  和平保卫者
    编者按：原子弹究竟能不能决定战争的胜负？这是不少读者要求解答的问题。世界保卫和平大会委员会机关刊物——“和平保卫者”，曾对于原子战争问题，出版了一册专刊，由世界原子能权威约里奥——居里等执笔，对于原子武器作了深刻的精辟的分析，这些分析，充分说明原子武器并不能决定战争的胜败。本刊特将该专刊第六章中关于这个问题说明的主要部分转载在这里。题目是本刊编者所加的。中国保卫世界和平大会委员会已将该专刊译出，由世界知识社出版，作为世界知识丛书之一。
    原子弹在陆地战争里是不是一种具有决定性的武器？
    原子弹具有下列两种特色：制造成本价格高昂（十亿到三十亿法郎）和一个小面积（大约五平方公里）的彻底清除。假如要波及整个法国，那便需要十万枚原子弹——价值相当于二百万亿到三百万亿法郎。因此原子弹的投掷，也就和其他炸弹一样，必要选择一些有意义的目标。
    对于军事动员的效果：一个有组织的国家必定有由职业军人与役青年服所构成的常备军队。这个军队及它的领袖们在和平时期便分散在各小部队里；存蓄的军需品、机关枪、战车、大炮、飞机全部散布在不计其数的而且往往是被掩护着的小贮藏所里，原子进攻的威力，无论如何强大，是不能瓦解军队的指挥系统，不能毁坏军备，不能阻止大规模的军事动员的。
    在战争的前线上，为了战略的使用：在任何一个陆地的阵线上，无论人力与物力如何集中的地方，全都没有使用原子弹这种巨大消耗的必要。假如向占据着三○二阵地的一个步兵联队投掷原子弹，那或许可杀死二千名步兵，而并不能伤害到藏在地下壕或在洋灰筑的暗壕里的兵士；这些遮蔽着的兵士仍可以抵御敌人的攻击，而且在两三公里距离又有另外一个步兵联队所占据着的三○二阵地。由于放射作用，至少在数小时内，进攻者不能前进。至于为了毁坏几座炮台而就投掷一枚原子弹，那更是不值得了。使用原子弹攻击一个战车列队或是在飞机场里的飞机也是同样地不值得。
    因此，原子弹在战略上的使用就好比使用七五式炮，或蒸气铁锥杀苍蝇；当然，这样也可以把苍蝇杀死，可是这种做法是从来没有人应用过的。
    在阵线后方的效果：投掷一枚价值昂贵的原子弹为了轰炸一座桥是不是合理呢？假如飞机上的投弹手瞄差了一百公尺，那座桥就和日本城市的桥一样地存在着不动。使用原子弹轰炸一个车站是不是合理呢？这个被炸了的车站两天后可以恢复了（不过在广岛被轰炸后，经过八天的时间，火车才重新通行，可是当时地面并没有受到这地上爆炸的影响。事实上只需要两天，这个火车站就可以使用了）。至于使用原子弹轰炸公路上的载重汽车队那是更加不值得了！
    “我们因此可以了解为什么仍然需要步兵和炮兵…由于侵入敌境时在通常战术上，它们仍然是最强有力的战斗主力…在敌国内的军队往往须要和游击队作战…一个军队所应用的技术方法愈精良愈容易受到游击队的伤害”（沙斯铁尔及威聂龙R.Chasie iet L.Vigneron合著《原子能，是个光明的前途呢，抑或灾殃呢？》第九十、九十一页）
    唯一可能做的似乎只有在切断敌军的富源方面，使其因军备供给的来源断绝而濒于死亡。试问这又是不是可能呢？
    原子武器在军略上的应用：一个有战斗意志的国家便有很大的伸缩性。我们可以举出以下的各种例子：
    一、法国：在一九一四年的时候，德国人出人意料地在一个月的期间把所有法国北部和比利时的煤矿、纺织业，所有的钢铁业工厂全都攫取了去。对于协约国来讲，其损失等于一千枚原子弹的轰炸，事实上还不止此数，因为德国人攫取了这些东西以后，并未加破坏而安全地利用这些矿山和工厂为他们自己生产。但法国虽失去了全国百分之六十的煤产，结果在一九一八年时仍获得了胜利。
    二、苏联：在一九四一年的时候，骤然间德国人在一个月里用围攻的方式歼灭了二百万装置完备的苏联军队，然后进攻乌克兰、顿尼次流域，一块拥有三千万苏联居民的广大领土、一部分工厂、机械、农场全都落到德国人的手里。
    希特勒的军队是残暴无比的，甚至原子弹也不至于屠杀更多的性命，造成更多的灾祸，削弱更多的苏联实力。
    三、德意志：美国的关于战略上的轰炸调查报告里有联盟国所投掷到德国以及其占领国家炸弹重量的统计数字。我们都晓得一颗原子弹相等于三千吨的普通炸弹的估计是合理的。
    以下是所投掷炸弹的统计数字：
    德国：一百三十五万吨——等于四百五十枚原子弹。
    法国被德军占领区：五十九万吨——等于一百五十枚原子弹。
    其他被德军占领国家：五十七万吨——等于一百四十枚原子弹。
    总计：七百四十枚原子弹。
    在我们所时常听到无线电广播中报告的战略上轰炸的过程中，（根据卡尔多Kaldor在经济学研究杂志所发表）德国军事工业发展情形如下：
        一九四○——一○○
        一九四一——一○一
        一九四二——一四六
        一九四三——二二九
        一九四四——二八五
    这种发展情势的终止确是正当其时。苏联的炮队、战车和步兵攻陷柏林，粉碎了希特勒的梦想真正是件值得庆幸的事。
    四、日本：德国吃了相等于七百五十枚原子弹的炸弹，而日本在吃到了第二枚原子弹时便投降了（我们现在已经晓得当时第三枚原子弹还没有制造成）。日本当时的情势是怎么样的呢？
    德国战败了，全世界在反对日本；日本的舰队被美国舰队击沉了；饥荒盛行着；石油的供给来源断绝了，它被全面封锁；空军的力量占绝对劣势。
    八月八日，苏联遵守以前的诺言，以最高速度进占满洲，当时指挥蒋介石的空军的美国将军陈纳德（他并没有丝毫“红色”的嫌疑）八月十五日向纽约时报宣称：
    “苏联参加对日战争是使战事加快结束的具有决定性的因素；即使原子弹没有投掷，结果仍是一样。”
    日本投降是因为它并没有其他解决的方法；原子弹的使用不过是给美国军人们“面子”罢了。
    不，原子武器并不是一种在战争的胜败上具有决定性的武器
    既然一个拥有集中人口城市的德国都能够吃得下相等于七百五十颗原子炸弹，并且还能够在同时把它的军备生产增加三倍，那么我们便可以想像到如同苏联和美国那般大的大陆，能够吃得下多少原子弹了。
    又何况，苏联和美国双方全都有原子弹，灾害并不限于单方。很显然地，被原子弹攻击的一方势必认为使用原子弹来报复是一种合法的自卫：这也就是在一九一四——一八年的战争时，联军也使用了毒气而在良心上并没有犯反对人类的罪恶。
    飞机既然需要飞入敌人的领土几千公里之远，那么也就只有一小部分的炸弹可以击中目标。纵令美国现存的原子弹有五百至二千枚——那是无稽的估计，达到百分之百的效率（事实上是不可能的），对苏联的攻击仍离决定性的程度很远。
    在战争开始后的第一个时期里，工业必将散布到各小城市里，并且，好像德国人曾经开始了的，将建筑地下工厂。这么一来，大量的原子弹也要失去作用，因为已经没有了攻击的目标；交战国的工业将在另一种方式下重新建立起来。
    这样看来，原子武器并不能使一个交战国在战争里获得胜利；原子武器不过是一种有力的补充武器而已。步兵仍然是必需的，而且步兵队伍还能够进展。
    大西洋公约也正是为了供给这个绝对不可缺乏的步兵的目的而成立的。美国著名记者李普曼在他的近著《冷战》一书里赤裸裸地说道：
    “那是极显明的，西欧国家将供给大量的人力，美国则供应军火。”
    原子弹与海上战争
    讲到海上战争，情形就不同了：战舰价值很贵（一条巡洋舰价值四百亿法郎）而且轰炸目标集中。现在问题不是使用七五式炮杀苍蝇了，而是用一颗炮弹来杀一只象了。这是比较合算的。
    以下便是法国官方派往比基尼的观察者哥德士密特（Goldscnmidt）报告中所述关于一枚原子弹投落在一个舰队上的灾情：
    “下雨以后，巡洋舰阿甘色斯号就已不在了；航空母舰萨刺拓加号原浮在六百公尺距离外的，在七个半小时后沉没了；另外的三艘较小的船立刻沉没。四万吨的日本巡洋舰长丸号，五日后才沉没。”
    我们不要忘记在一个三四公里周围的地方，一阵有着放射作用的雨（这雨在地面上是不会有的）使船只中了毒素。因此，船上人员必需立刻疏散，否则所有船上的人将于三个星期内因患贫血症而死亡。就在几年之后，美国人仍不得不把留在比基尼的船只淹没了，因为这些船只仍一直有着放射作用。
    由于这个原因，海上护航制及大规模的舰队全都不得不终止了。对于运输的商船，已无法保护，防御潜水艇的攻击。
    只要一个原子弹投落在某个港口里，就足以毒化这港口了。经过若干月、若干年仍不散失。因此，由于没有了停泊和修理船只的港口，整个舰队就难免中毒。四十颗原子弹投落到英国的港岸上可使英国与外界隔离。国内的工业固然可以不动，然而它再不能输入原料，全国人民将陷于饥荒的境地。
    海军将无法行使它的职责
    一切海上登陆全将变为不可能了，因为用一大批船载满了人与物资，将被原子弹完全毁灭。以下是（一九四七年七月）美国的报告里所说：
    “无疑地如同一九四四年在诺曼第登陆，大批的人和巨量的物资集中在一个海面或海岸的很小的面积上的作战方式，将来纵使不是绝对没有可能，至少是极度冒险的了。”
    一种新的战争？
    这样的战争，使用原子或其他武器不断地继续轰炸，使城市生活变为不可能了。像纽约、伦敦、莫斯科、巴黎这样的城市全都有变为烟和尘土的危险，全都可能变成埋葬千百万人尸体的大坟场。
    这样的战争并不是就把战争时期缩短了，并不能停止前线上的残杀。
    这也并不能决定战争的胜负，原子武器并不能决定战争期间的长短。
    也许有一天会发动生物战争，使用超度罪恶的武器，新的黑死症，新的霍乱症，新的麻疯症和“变质了的”伤寒症，有一天或许这些武器还能够毁坏农村的收获并且造成巨大的饥荒。
    一九一四——一八年的战争屠杀了一千五百万人，一九三九——四五年的战争里牺牲了四千五百到五千万人的性命。
    现在又要把我们投到一个牺牲多少人命的战争里去呢？
    “氢原子弹”
    目前，原子弹——那足够残酷的——是唯一存在着的事实。
    可是，人们正研究着一种利用原子弹作爆炸的引子而把它围绕着一种轻的元素的混合物（其中或许有重氢），这混合体由原子弹把它提高到近乎十亿度的热的时候便自动爆炸了。这就是所谓氢原子弹。
    直到如今还没有证实这氢原子弹是不是能够制造。
    不过假如能够制造的话，制造氢原子弹的因素（重量轻的元素和普通原子弹）都掌握在苏联和美国两个大强国的手中。
    假如这种炸弹的制造果然实现，它的毁灭能力必然比普通原子弹强大得多。这氢原子弹可以杀灭更大量的城市人口。然而也比较普通原子弹价值要贵得多，至于对于攻击军队及散布的工业也和普通原子弹同样的无效，同样地不能决定战争的胜负。
    心理战争
    杜鲁门总统认为有谈及氢原子弹的必要，这是很特殊的；在使用一种武器之前就预先宣布出来，这是有史以来的第一次；而且这次还是在武器未制造出来时就预先宣布。
    试问德国人有没有在他们使用毒气和飞机之前预先告诉我们呢？我们是不是曾预先讲出使用战车来威胁他们呢？德国人有没有预先谈到他们的磁性水雷？英国人预先讲出他们的雷达了没有？德国人讲出他们的Ｖ２了没有？杜鲁门又有没有在使用原子弹之前对任何人先下了警告呢？
    这种宣传的理由是心理方面的：事实上，美国从事原子弹的制造自从一九四二年便开始了；可是到了一九四九年，原子弹的独占宣布终止，国际间的谈判取得了相当的平衡，而世界舆论由于保卫和平运动的支持向着争取开始交涉成立无条件禁止原子武器的国际协定推进。于是杜鲁门总统，在这个压力之前，便在参议员詹森所广播揭露的消息以后，一九五○年二月一日那天，宣布了美国“在氢原子弹的制造上继续工作”。
    这样的一个消息使全世界受到了震惊，并且认为是一个罪恶的揭露，那是当然了；可是，同时很显然地这个宣传政策对于美国来讲是完全不合理的——美国在这个问题上绝对没有任何技术的和科学的进展；美国首先以氢原子弹威胁世界，而它自己还不能保证它确定能够首先把氢原子弹制造成功。这也就是氢原子弹的宣布激起美国人士多方激烈抗议的原因之一。（可是我们记得在美国原子独占的时期，美国人士提出抗议反对原子弹的却很少。）我们在本书的第七章里便可看到美国各社会阶层人士的反应。
    “袖珍”原子武器
    之后还另外传布着一个类似的消息：不是巨型的炸弹而是极小的炸弹。据说美国制造成功一种袖珍原子弹可供军队在前线时战略上的使用。
    当然，弹丸的附带品（如弹壳、爆炸器）的重量可能减少，然而这对于整个弹丸制造的成本仍然是一样的。因为成本主要是以极昂贵的“镨”决定的。
    我们晓得“镨”必须要有一定的临界体积才可能爆炸。即使在弹丸的周围放置一些最完善的中子反射物，我们最多能够希望减少镨的临界体积四分之一或三分之一，而不能再多了。弹丸的成本虽然减低了四分之一或三分之一，仍然是非常昂贵的；因此，弹丸的目的物仍只能是集中的和有着异常重大价值的东西。
    自然，假如袖珍原子弹当真存在的话，那么就可以使军力微弱而士气不振的队伍在一个原子屏障的后面前进，就好像一九四四年时候的步兵队伍在炮火的掩护下前进一样。不过这足以令人神驰的远景仅仅是个虚构的想像而已——这是为了安慰那些一方面预备战争一方面又不愿有一天在一个国际法庭（像纽伦堡法庭似的）之前受审判的人们的惶恐的。
    氢原子弹原是一种心理战的武器，为了安定美国的群众心理和要使欧洲人民获得深刻印象而产生的。袖珍弹也是一种心理战的武器，为了安定欧洲一些赞助大西洋公约的人而设的。
    飞碟的幻想
    另外一种心理战的武器——为了在美国群众里维持一种不安的情绪并且逐渐造成一种战争的精神病——那便是飞碟的故事。令人可虑的是在美国有许多人，有的还是善意的、肯定曾经看见过这种飞碟（无疑地，飞碟当然是来自东方）。在中世纪，法国也有过许多人曾经见过“妖魔”，并且许多薪堆全都是他们放火烧起来的。

    在战争中，攻击之前，先要发出一阵炮火使敌人惶恐，削弱敌人的斗志，然后步兵队伍便随着赶上去突击。在发动战争之前也需要一种“心理准备”：那便是飞碟、袖珍弹、巨型弹的宣布了。我们以后必然还可以看到更加无稽的消息，例如一些（足以使人类在不可避免的灾祸面前屈服的）神秘武器的宣布。然而，我们要记得在步兵队伍突击前的炮火没有发生效力的时候，部队的进攻是需要延迟的。现在，我们是可以使心理战争准备失败的，那么战争本身就将不得不延期，而后变成不可能。
    为了达到这目的应该怎样做呢？我们先要认清危险所在，才能保持冷静，不致惊惶失色；我们的神经切不可动摇。我们每个人在原子战争的无名恐怖之前感到义愤填胸，全都要变成真正的和平保卫者——我们每个人全都要能够向我们的邻人及朋友们解释，使他们明了他们所应该采取的立场，这就是斯德哥尔摩的号召所急切要求于我们的。
