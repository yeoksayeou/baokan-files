Yushu County Party Committee Agricultural Rectification Meeting:
Proposing Suggestions for Improving Agricultural Work;
Grasping the Production Season to Resolve Various Contradictions in Developing Production

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] During the rectification movement in Yushu County, Jilin Province, the Yushu County Party Committee convened an agricultural conference to examine agricultural work and propose suggestions for future improvements. The conference revealed that in leading agricultural production, due to the one-sidedness of the leadership's thinking, emphasis was placed on the objective requirements of rural economic development, while neglecting the understanding and education of farmers' thoughts and emotions. There was insufficient estimation of the difficulties that might arise in improving production, and an overestimation of the strength of the cadres. Coupled with a weak mass perspective, this led to impatience in the work of improving production and upgrading technology. In actual work, there were heavy tasks and numerous arrangements, but a lack of inspection and education, resulting in tendencies towards coercion, commandism, and formalism.

Based on the above examination, the agricultural conference put forward the following suggestions for improvement:

First, to improve the county's agricultural production in 1951 with a spirit of steady progress. The speed of agricultural improvement must be determined by the requirements of rural economic development, the farmers' conscious voluntariness, and the leadership of the Party. In leading agricultural production, the following issues should be resolved in a step-by-step manner: 1. The contradiction between the farmers' urgent demand for expanded reproduction and the conservative thinking in improving agricultural technology; 2. The contradiction between the demand for planned expansion of special crops and the decentralized small-scale farming; 3. Strengthening the leadership of cooperative mutual aid economies in the development of various economic components in rural areas. These are some of the basic problems that were raised in 1950 but not well resolved. The county leading organs should continue to improve agricultural technology in a typical demonstration manner, organizing farmers to buy carts and horses, and purchase new farm tools, and investing in expanded reproduction. Secondly, in conjunction with the grain purchase work of the cooperatives after the autumn harvest, extensive publicity should be carried out to determine the acreage of special crops from the bottom up, striving to cultivate 140,000 hectares of special crops throughout the county. At the same time, implement the production policy, correct the attitude of discriminating against individual farmers, and launch a production upsurge in rural areas in an organized and guided manner.

Secondly, in implementing the plan, it is necessary to seize the agricultural season, especially the agricultural season after the autumn harvest. Experience has shown that the period from when farmers finish threshing to around the lunar new year is the most active season in the rural economy. Sixty to seventy percent of the farmers' surplus grain needs to find a way out during this period, and supply and marketing cooperatives should solve this problem well, providing farmers with the necessities of production and life. As the rural economy gets on the right track and rises day by day, farmers will plan for agricultural investment for the second year during this season; the reorganization of labor exchange and mutual aid teams also needs to be carried out at this time. County and district leaders should help farmers solve these problems. If these problems are solved well, it will have a significant impact on agricultural production in 1951. The county leading organs must understand that after agricultural production becomes regularized, the decisive link in leading agricultural production is no longer the period of preparing for spring plowing, but rather the period from after the autumn harvest to around the lunar new year. Only by seizing this season while not relaxing the central tasks in other agricultural seasons can the agricultural production plan be gradually realized.

Third, the spirit of this inspection work, summarizing experience, should be gradually deepened into districts and villages. The main content of this rectification in Yushu is to oppose impatience in leading agricultural production and commandism and formalism in implementing work. Facts have proven that cadres at all levels will not complete tasks within the limits of strictly following policies, are not good at humbly consulting with the local people, will not study the overall situation, disregard whether it is actually possible, but rather adopt simple methods of general mobilization, urging, and inspection to complete tasks. As a result, although the task is completed, the people suffer losses that could have been avoided.

In the county's year-long large-scale production movement, some new work experiences have been gained, such as the award and evaluation work in agricultural production; the mass movement in improving agricultural technology; and the cultivation of points and the expansion of surfaces in improving mutual aid teams. There are many good examples in these aspects. County Party Committee leaders should be good at discovering these examples, summarizing experience to educate the entire Party. At the same time, cadres should be cultivated, the masses should be educated, and leadership should be improved through serious inspection, summary, and self-criticism of work.

Fourth, actively and systematically achieve the division of labor between the Party and the government, and strengthen and give full play to the role of governments at all levels and people's representative meetings in economic construction. In the past year, many people's representative meetings have been held at the county, district, and village levels, but they have not played a big enough role. In the work, the county leading organs often make decisions on broad mass issues by convening cadre meetings. This is a manifestation of a weak mass perspective. In the future, all important work in economic construction should be submitted to the People's Congress for discussion and decision. People attending the meeting should have full speaking rights; governments at all levels should earnestly formulate plans and implement the resolutions of the representative meetings. In this way, the leading organs of the Party at all levels can concentrate their efforts on studying the situation, grasping policies, cultivating typical examples, and inspecting and summarizing work. These aspects are precisely the weakest links in the current work of Yushu County.

### 榆树县委农业整风会议上  提出改进农业工作意见  掌握生产季节解决发展生产中的各种矛盾

　　榆树县委农业整风会议上
    提出改进农业工作意见
    掌握生产季节解决发展生产中的各种矛盾
    【本报讯】吉林省榆树县整风运动中，中共榆树县委曾召开农业会议，检查农业工作，并提出今后的改进意见。会议中检查出在领导农业生产中，由于领导思想有片面性，强调了农村经济发展中的客观要求，忽视了对农民思想情绪的掌握教育；对于提高生产中可能发生的困难估计不足，对干部的力量估计过高，加之群众观点薄弱，因而在提高生产改进技术的工作中就犯了急性病。在实际工作中任务重布置多，缺少检查教育，因而存在着强迫命令和形式主义的偏向。
    农业会议根据以上检查，提出了改进意见：
    首先，以稳步前进的精神，提高一九五一年的全县农业生产。农业改进的速度必须根据农村经济发展的要求、农民的自觉自愿和党的领导来决定。在领导农业生产中，应有步骤的解决以下几个问题。一、农民扩大再生产的迫切要求，与改进农业技术中的保守思想的矛盾；二、有计划的扩大特种作物的要求，与分散小农经营之间的矛盾；三、在发展农村各种经济成份中，加强合作互助经济的领导。这是一九五○年已经提出而没有很好解决的几个基本问题。县领导机关应当以典型示范的方式，继续提高农业技术，组织农民买车买马购买新农具，对扩大再生产进行投资。其次，应结合秋后合作社的购粮工作，深入宣传，自下而上的确定特种作物面积，全县争取耕种十四万垧特种作物。同时贯彻生产政策，纠正歧视单干户的态度，有组织有领导地掀起农村中的生产高潮。
    其次，在贯彻计划中必须抓紧农业季节，特别是秋后的农业季节。经验证明，从农民打完场到旧历年前后，是农村经济最活跃的季节，农民余粮之百分之六、七十要求在这个时期内找到出路，供销合作社应很好地解决这个问题，供给农民以生产和生活必需品。由于农村经济走上正轨，并日益上升，农民要在这个季节筹划第二年的农业投资；换工互助组的整理，也需要在这个时候进行。县、区领导就应帮助农民解决这些问题。这些问题如果解决得好，对一九五一年农业生产就有重大的作用。县领导机关必须了解农业生产走向正规后，领导农业生产的决定环节已不是准备春耕时期，而是从秋后到旧历年前后。只有抓紧这个季节，同时又不放松其他农业季节中的中心工作，才能把农业生产计划逐步实现。
    第三，要认真的将这次检查工作，总结经验的精神逐步的深入到区村中去。榆树这次整风的主要内容，就是反对领导农业生产中的急性病，和执行工作中的强迫命令、形式主义。事实证明，各级干部不会在严格遵循政策的限度内完成任务，不善于虚心地和当地人民商量，不会研究全面情况，不顾事实上是否可能，而是采取一般的号召督促检查的简单方法去完成任务。结果任务虽完成了，但人民却受到本来可以避免的损失。
    在全县一年的大生产运动中，已经取得一些新的工作经验，如农业生产上的奖评工作；改进农业技术中的群众运动；改进互助组中的点的培养和面的展开等方面，都有许多好的范例。县委领导上要善于发现这些范例，总结经验教育全党。同时通过对工作的认真检查总结和自我批评来培养干部，教育群众，改进领导。
    第四，积极地有步骤地做到党政分工，加强与发挥各级政权及人民代表会议在经济建设中的作用。一年来县区村人民代表会议开的不少，但起的作用还不够大。在工作中，县领导机关还常常以召开干部会的方式，决定广大群众性的问题。这是群众观点不强的表现。今后经济建设中的一切重要工作，都应交人民代表会讨论，并作出决定。要使出席会议的人有充分的发言权；各级政府应切实将代表会的决议，制定计划，贯彻下去。这样，各级党的领导机构便可集中力量于研究情况，掌握政策，培养典型及工作的检查和总结等方面。而这些方面，正是目前榆树县工作中最弱的环节。
