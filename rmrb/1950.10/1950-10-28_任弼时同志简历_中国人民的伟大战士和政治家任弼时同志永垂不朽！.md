    Eternal Glory to Comrade Ren Bishi, Great Warrior and Statesman of the Chinese People!
    [Xinhua News Agency, 27th] The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China announces the following biography of Comrade Ren Bishi:
    Comrade Ren Bishi, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, member of the Central Political Bureau, and secretary of the Central Secretariat. Native of Xiangyin County, Hunan Province. Born on April 30, 1904, into the family of a poor teacher.
    While studying in middle school, Comrade Ren Bishi encountered the May Fourth Movement and accepted revolutionary ideas. In 1920, he joined the Chinese Socialist Youth League in Shanghai and then went to the Soviet Union to study. In early 1922, he joined the Communist Party of China.
    In 1924, Comrade Ren Bishi returned to Shanghai to participate in the work of the Chinese Communist Youth League, and in 1925 he served as the Minister of Organization of the Central Committee of the Youth League. In the same year, he was elected as a member of the Central Committee of the Youth League at the Third National Congress of the Youth League. In 1926, he served as Acting Secretary of the Central Committee of the Youth League. At the Fourth Congress of the Youth League in 1927, Comrade Ren Bishi was re-elected as a member of the Central Committee of the Youth League and served as Secretary of the Central Committee of the League. In the same year, at the Fifth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, he was elected as a member of the Central Committee of the Party. At this time, opportunism arose within the Party under Chen Duxiu, and Comrade Ren Bishi led the Youth League in a struggle against this opportunist line, actively supporting the Party's revolutionary line.
    In 1928, Comrade Ren Bishi transferred to work in the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and was re-elected as a member of the Central Committee at the Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. In October of the same year, when he was inspecting Party work in Anhui, he was arrested and imprisoned in Nanling County by the reactionary rulers of the Kuomintang. He was subjected to torture by the reactionary Kuomintang government in prison, but remained steadfast and unyielding. After being rescued by the Party, he was released from prison in March 1929. After his release, Comrade Ren Bishi participated in the work of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Party, serving as a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee. In September 1929, Comrade Bishi was arrested again in Shanghai and imprisoned in the Western Prison, where he was subjected to electric torture by the imperialists. Thanks to the Party's rescue, he was released from prison two months after his arrest. In both imprisonments, Comrade Ren Bishi demonstrated the noble integrity of a Communist.
    After his second release from prison, Comrade Bishi was sent by the Central Committee of the Party to Wuhan to participate in the work of the Party's Yangtze River Bureau as a member, concurrently serving as Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee and Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee. At the end of 1930, he participated in the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party in Shanghai and was elected as a member of the Central Political Bureau.
    In March 1931, the Party sent Comrade Ren Bishi to the Central Revolutionary Base in Jiangxi to participate in the then Party Central Bureau of the region as a member, concurrently serving as Minister of the Organization Department. In May 1933, the Party Central Committee sent him to the Xianggan border area to serve as Secretary of the Provincial Committee and concurrently as Political Commissar of the Xianggan Military Region. In July 1934, the Sixth Army Group of the Xianggan Red Army broke through, and Comrade Ren Bishi served as Chairman of the Political Committee of the Sixth Army Group of the Red Army. In October of the same year, the Sixth Army Group of the Red Army joined forces with the Second Army Group of the Red Army led by Comrades He Long and Guan Xiangying in eastern Guizhou to open up the Xiang-E-Chuan-Qian Revolutionary Base. Comrade Ren Bishi served as Secretary of the Central Bureau and concurrently as Political Commissar of the Second Front Army composed of the Second and Sixth Army Groups of the Red Army. In November 1935, the Second Front Army of the Red Army broke through the Xiang-E-Chuan-Qian border area for the Long March, passing through Hunan, Guizhou, and Yunnan to Garze in Xikang, where it joined forces with the Fourth Front Army of the Red Army in June 1936. There, Comrade Bishi, as the Political Commissar of the Second Front Army, together with Comrade Zhu De and many other comrades, carried out a struggle against the traitor Zhang Guotao, and finally enabled the entire Second Front Army and part of the Fourth Front Army to reach northern Shaanxi smoothly in November of the same year, joining forces with the First Front Army of the Red Army. After the First, Second, and Fourth Front Armies joined forces, Comrade Bishi was appointed as the Political Commissar of the Front Headquarters.
    After the July 7th Incident in 1937, the Red Army was reorganized into the Eighth Route Army of the National Revolutionary Army, and Comrade Ren Bishi served as Director of the General Political Department of the Eighth Route Army. In August of the same year, he went to the front line in Shanxi with the army to participate in the War of Resistance Against Japan. In 1940, he returned to Yan'an to participate in the work of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. At the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1945, Comrade Ren Bishi was elected as a member of the Central Committee and, at the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee, was elected as a member of the Central Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Secretariat.
    In the great People's Liberation War against American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, after withdrawing from Yan'an in March 1947, Comrade Ren Bishi stayed with Chairman Mao in northern Shaanxi to persist in the struggle. In April 1949, he took a rest due to the aggravation of hypertension. In June 1950, he gradually resumed work. On October 25, he suddenly suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, and despite the doctors' best efforts, he passed away at 12:36 on the 27th. He was 46 years old.
