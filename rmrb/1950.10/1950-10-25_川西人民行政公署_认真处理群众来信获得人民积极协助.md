　　Western Sichuan People's Administrative Office
    Earnestly Handles Letters from the Masses and Obtains Active Assistance from the People
    [Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 19th] The Western Sichuan People's Administrative Office earnestly handles letters from people of all walks of life containing criticisms and suggestions regarding the government's work and regularly publishes them, strengthening the connection between the People's Government and the people. In the four months from June to September this year, the office received a total of 4,162 letters from people of all walks of life. In addition to being handled by dedicated personnel, many letters were personally reviewed by Li Jingquan, Director of the Administrative Office, and Yan Xiufeng, Deputy Director, with their opinions noted, and forwarded to relevant departments and relevant organs, troops, or people's organizations. The heads of each department and each organ and organization were required to report to the Administrative Office weekly on the handling of the letters. The Administrative Office also regularly conducted supervision and inspection and published the handling results in the form of announcements every month. The names of writers who did not wish to be disclosed were kept confidential during publication.
    As a result of earnestly handling the letters from the masses, the connection between the government and the people has become closer. The People's Government has received active assistance from the masses in completing various central tasks. At the same time, by absorbing the opinions of the masses, the government's work has been better able to meet the greatest interests of the greatest majority of the people. Some conspiracies of bandits and special agents, illegal activities of lawless elements selling opium and silver dollars, and hoarding and speculation cases have been solved because they were exposed in letters from the masses. The People's Government has also organized projects such as building water conservancy projects, sheltering beggars, providing relief to the unemployed, and renovating streets, based on the suggestions or requests of the masses and within its capabilities.
    Another gain from doing a good job of handling letters from the masses is that it has promoted and strengthened the people's supervision of the government's working cadres. Some incidents of illegal activities and dereliction of duty by some working cadres have been corrected in a timely manner after being exposed in letters from the masses. People from all walks of life have unanimously praised this method of listening to public opinion and have written letters thanking the People's Government.

　　川西人民行政公署
    认真处理群众来信获得人民积极协助
    【新华社成都十九日电】川西区人民行政公署认真处理各界人民对政府工作的批评和建议信件，并定期予以公布，加强了人民政府与人民间的联系。该行署在今年六月至九月的四个月内，共收到各界人民来信四千一百六十二件。除由专人负责处理外，其中许多信件并由行署主任李井泉和副主任阎秀峰亲自批注意见，分转所属各部门及有关机关、部队或人民团体，规定各部门及各机关、团体负责人每周向行署报告处理来信情况。行署并经常进行督促和检查，每月以公告形式公布处理结果。写信人不愿公布姓名的，公布时均予保守秘密。
    由于认真地处理了人民群众的来信，政府和人民的联系更加密切。人民政府在完成各种中心工作中，得到了人民群众的积极协助。同时，政府因吸收群众意见，在各种工作上也更能符合最大多数人民群众的最大利益。有些土匪特务的阴谋活动、不法分子违法贩卖毒品银洋和囤积居奇等案件，均因人民群众来信揭露而破获。人民政府并根据人民群众的建议或要求，在力所能及的条件下，举办了兴修水利、收容乞丐、救济失业、整修街道等工作。
    做好处理人民群众来信工作的另一个收获，是促进和加强了人民对政府工作干部的监督。有些工作干部的违法渎职事件，经群众来信揭发后得以及时纠正。这种倾听民情的办法，各界人民一致赞扬，纷纷写信感谢人民政府。
