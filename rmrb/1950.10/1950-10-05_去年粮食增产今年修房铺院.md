　　Grain Production Increased Last Year, Housing Renovated and Courtyards Paved This Year
　　During this year's production increase campaign, we originally planned to apply 90 loads of base and top dressing fertilizer per mu to autumn land. The actual amount exceeded this by 18 loads, and was 23 loads more per mu than last year. Apart from the nine mu of miscellaneous grain land, all seeds of millet, corn, hemp, etc., were treated with warm water soaking. Except for the 22 mu of miscellaneous grain and hemp land, all 89.8 mu of land were hoed, pulled, and weeded three times each. In order to achieve the goal of increasing production by another 2 dou per mu, 46 mu of land have been weeded four times.

　　Starting from June 29th, all nine men and ten women in the village were involved in the movement to cut wormwood, collect wild wormwood, and scrape bank soil to accumulate fertilizer. As of September 29th, in one month, we accumulated a total of 4,270 loads of fertilizer, averaging 43 loads per mu. We are now striving to accumulate another 17 loads per mu before autumn, reaching the plan of accumulating 60 loads of fertilizer per mu before autumn, which has laid a preliminary foundation for next year's production increase. This year, our crops are growing plump and tall, and the masses are happily saying: "Listening to Chairman Mao's words, mutual aid is powerful, crops grow well, thanks to Chairman Mao's teachings. We will always listen to Chairman Mao's words and follow Chairman Mao!"

　　Our lives are getting better day by day. This year, we built eight more brick houses, paved two courtyards, and added two pigs; also, we have ten cattle of various sizes, four more than before the war; and we have added fourteen sheep. Every household has felt mattresses and quilts. Under your leadership, after six years of mutual aid production, we not only have enough to eat and wear, but also have two households with more than one year's surplus grain, four households with half a year's surplus grain, one household with two months' surplus grain, and two households with enough to eat and use. We are now continuing to move forward on the road of getting organized, developing production, and achieving a prosperous and well-fed life.

　　We have gradually realized that getting organized, improving technology, and deep and careful cultivation are good ways to increase grain production and live a good life. We not only help each other in agriculture, but also carry out sideline production in a centralized, decentralized, flexible, and mobile manner according to the production requirements of each season. The oil mill run by our group still has 600 jin of oil in stock, and we plan to purchase new agricultural implements in the future.

　　All nine households in our village support mutual aid, and everyone has benefited from mutual aid. Everyone says that our mutual aid group is truly a treasure bowl, capable of overcoming any difficulties. If we leave the mutual aid group, we probably wouldn't know how to produce! We have truly benefited from being organized! If it weren't for this, we wouldn't be able to go from poverty to wealth. You see, our barren mountains have been transformed into neat and tidy good land. You have brought us such great benefits, saved the lives of all the villagers, and led us to a prosperous and well-fed life. This is a great kindness that can never be forgotten!

　　The following is from a letter to Chairman Mao from all the members of the Liu Futian Mutual Aid Group in Shimiaozi Village, Taipingshao District, Kuandian County, Liaodong Province:

　　Chairman Mao:

　　We responded to your call and organized a mutual aid group on the first day of the first lunar month this year. In just eight months, we have gained many benefits. Now we would like to make a simple report to you on the achievements of these months and the production plans for agricultural and sideline industries after the autumn harvest.

　　In our Shimiaozi Village, five mutual aid groups were organized last spring. Because no work points were recorded, the final account was not settled, and the income from long-term sideline industries was distributed equally. As a result, all the mutual aid groups collapsed in less than ten days. After that, whenever the people of Shimiaozi Village mentioned mutual aid groups, everyone opposed them. At the end of last year, our group leader Liu Futian returned from attending the provincial model worker conference and said that Comrade Chen Tingshan in Linjiang had benefited greatly from organizing a mutual aid group, and Political Commissar Zhang also called on us to get organized and produce more grain. So, on the first day of the first lunar month this year, our five households reorganized. Starting from the third day of the first lunar month, we hitched up four sledges together to collect manure. In twelve days, we collected all the soil manure from the five households to the fields, a total of more than 500 sledges. On the sixteenth day of the first lunar month, the five laborers from the five households spent twenty-five days cutting 550,000 jin of firewood (including branch firewood) and stacking ten firewood stacks, each as large as three houses (enough for two and a half years of burning). When we worked individually last year, the five households only cut 200,000 jin. Liu Hanren, who worked individually, cut firewood for more than a month and only cut 12,000 jin; he was still unable to haul it home from the mountain. So he also asked to join our mutual aid group. After cutting the firewood, we repaired the field edges and headlands, and picked up stone grids (more than 500 carts in total), expanding the cultivated area by more than five mu. The masses all saw that we benefited greatly from being organized. During the spring plowing, two households joined our group, and when we were plowing the first time, another five households joined, for a total of twelve households and sixteen laborers, with a cultivated area of 186 mu (36 mu of flat land and 150 mu of mountain land, averaging 17th grade).

　　Getting Organized Brings Benefits, Masses Voluntarily Join Mutual Aid Groups

　　Getting organized is indeed more powerful than working individually. During the spring plowing, seven households with a total of four plows completed the plowing of the mountain and flat land (a total of 95 mu) in five days. Plowing the first time took four days (for weeding and thinning seedlings, twelve households with a total of 180 mu of land), and plowing three times only took two and a half days. When we worked individually last year, plowing twice took twenty-five days. This year, our entire group not only completed three plowings, three harrowings, and one weeding on the mountain and flat land, but also applied top dressing fertilizer to all of it. When we worked individually last year, we only managed two plowings and two harrowings, and did not apply top dressing fertilizer.

　　After the village people's representative meeting arranged for field seed selection on September 15th, our entire group carried out field seed selection on the 16th, and started the autumn harvest on the 18th. In just three days, six people harvested all the corn on 120 mu of land, and the remaining miscellaneous grains will also be harvested in three days. Our threshing ground has long been rolled smooth, and we will start warming the ground in late October. Warming the ground does not waste crops, and people are less likely to get cold.

　　The crops of our group are growing very well because they were planted early, weeded and thinned, fertilized sufficiently, and hoed in a timely manner. When we hoed the third time, we saw that the crops were growing really happily. Unfortunately, for forty-five consecutive days, it did not rain when the corn was forming ears, and on August 9th, a strong wind blew the corn down. Even so, our corn yield this time still reached an average of 60%. The corn of individual households only reached 40%.

　　The women of our entire group are also organized (eleven full laborers). During the spring plowing, they twisted seeds and filtered manure; during the summer hoeing, they pulled weeds and caught pests. During the off-season, they collected manure and burned soil from the bottom of pots. Their specialized long-term sideline industries are raising pigs, raising chickens, and spinning thread. From January to now, the total income from sideline production for the entire group is 259 million Northeast currency.

　　Making Money from Sideline Industries to Buy Mules, Cattle, and Cloth

　　Due to the large income from sideline industries, the living standards of the entire group have risen rapidly. We have purchased one mule, two cattle, and 4,210 chi of cloth. The entire group of 71 people has an average of two sets of single clothing and one set of cotton clothing. The entire group has 60 quilts. During the puppet Manchukuo period, an average of five families shared one quilt, and half of the women and 80% of the children did not have cotton clothing in winter. At that time, only two households had enough grain to eat. Liu Futian said: "Before I was sixteen years old, I never had a quilt to cover. I worked for the landlords for free, and they only provided food. I started earning money at seventeen and made a small quilt with one jin of cotton. Thinking back to that time, we were really poor. If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we wouldn't have the happiness we have today."

　　Our agricultural and sideline production plans after the autumn harvest this year are: opening a flour mill, running transportation, accumulating fertilizer, hunting, and cutting thatch for roofs and firewood for sale. In short, we will always make appropriate use of manpower and animal power, and there will be no idle men or women. We plan to complete another 200 million Northeast currency in sideline income by March next year. All members of the group guarantee to work hard to complete the sideline production plan.

　　Chairman Mao! The power of being organized is great. Because our mutual aid group in Shimiaozi Village has benefited greatly, another mutual aid group has been developed, with twenty-six work teams in total, saving thirty laborers, increasing production, and improving living standards. We hope that all our farmer brothers and sisters in China will get organized to develop production and gradually enrich their lives.

### 去年粮食增产今年修房铺院

　　去年粮食增产今年修房铺院
    今年在增产运动中，我们原计划秋地每亩上底肥追肥九十担，结果超过了十八担，较去年每亩多上二十三担。除了九亩杂粮地外，谷、玉茭、麻籽等种籽全部实行温汤浸种；除了杂粮地、麻地二十二亩外，八十九亩八分地全部实行了锄、拉、耨各三遍；为了达到每亩再增产二斗的目的，有四十六亩地已进行了四遍除草。
    从六月二十九日起，全村九个男子和十个妇女都卷入了割岸蒿、野蒿、刮岸土积肥运动，截至九月二十九日止，一月时间，我们共积肥四千二百七十担，每亩平均四十三担，现在争取秋前每亩再积十七担，达到秋前每亩积肥六十担的计划，已初步打下明年的增产基础。今年我们的庄稼都长得肥胖高大，群众都高兴地说：听从毛主席的话，互助力量大，庄稼长得好，多亏毛主席教导。我们永远要听毛主席的话，跟毛主席走！
    我们的日子一天比一天好了。今年又修了八间楼房，铺了两个院子，添了两口猪；还有大小牛十头，较战前多了四头；新增羊十四只。家家都有毡子铺、被子盖。我们在你的领导下，经过了六年的互助生产，不仅有吃有穿，且有存一年余粮的两户，半年余粮的四户，二个月余粮的一户，够吃够用的两户。现在仍在继续向组织起来、发展生产的丰衣足食的道路前进。
    我们逐渐体会到组织起来，提高技术，深耕细作是增产粮食过好光景的好办法。我们不仅在农业上互助，而且还根据各季节生产要求，集中、分散、机动灵活地进行副业生产。我们全组经营的油房现在还存有六百斤油，计划将来购买新式农具。
    我村九户没一个不赞成互助的，大家都沾了互助的光。都说咱的互助组真是一个聚宝盆，啥困难也能克服，如果离开互助组，恐怕要不知该怎样生产哩！我们组织起来后真得到利益啦！要不是这，我们就不能由穷变富。您看看，我们的荒山都变成了很整齐的好地了。您给我们谋了这样大的利益，救活全村人民的生命，使我们走向丰衣足食的道路，这真是永世不能忘的大恩呀！
    辽东省宽甸县太平哨区石庙子村刘福田互助组全体组员给毛主席的信中说：毛主席：
    我们响应了你的号召，在今年正月初一（农历）组织了互助组，到现在仅八个月的工夫，得了不少的利益。现在特地把这几个月的成绩和秋收后农副业的生产计划，向你做简单的报告。
    俺们石庙子村，去春组织了五个互助组，因为不记工，最后没算开账，把长期搞副业的收入都给平均分配了。结果，不到十天的工夫互助组就全部垮了。以后，石庙子村的群众每提起互助组，大家都反对。去年年底，我们组长刘福田开完省劳模会回来后说，临江陈廷山同志组织互助组得利大，并且张政委也号召俺们组织起来多打粮食。于是俺们五户，就在今年正月初一重新组织起来，从正月初三就插起四个爬犁在一起捞粪了，十二天的工夫就把五户的土粪全部捞到地里，共捞了五百多爬犁。正月十六日，五户的五个劳动力，二十五天砍了五十五万斤大柴（枝柴在内），垛了十个柴火垛，每垛都有三间房子大（足够两年半烧的）。俺们去年单干的时候，五户才砍了二十万斤。单干的刘汉仁砍了一个多月的大柴，才砍了一万二千斤；还在山上没有力量往家捞。于是也要求参加了俺们的互助组。砍完大柴俺们就修理地头地脑，拣石格子（共拣了五百多车），扩大了耕地面积五亩多。群众都看见俺们组织起来得利大。在春耕的时候，参加了俺们组的有两户，在铲头遍地的时候，又加入了五户，总共十二户，十六个劳动力，耕地面积一百八十六亩（平地三十六亩，山地一百五十亩，平均十七级）。
    组织起来得到好处  群众自动入互助组
    组织起来倒底是比单干力量大。春耕的时候，七户共四副犁杖，五天全部把山地平地种完（共九十五亩）。锄头遍地用了四天（铲混苗，十二户共一百八十亩地），铲三遍地仅用了两天半。去年单干的时候，铲两遍还用了二十五天。俺们今年全组不但山平地完成了三铲、三趟、薅一遍，并且全部上了追肥。去年单干的时候，仅做到两铲两趟，没上追肥。
    九月十五日村人民代表会布置田间选种以后，十六日，俺们全组就进行田间选种，十八日开始秋收。仅六个人三天的工夫，一百二十亩地的苞米，全部割完，其余五谷杂粮，三天也保证割完。俺们的场园早已滚得光溜溜，于十月下旬，就要打暖场。打暖场不糟塌庄稼，人还少挨冷。
    俺们组的庄稼，因为种的早，铲混苗，粪力足，铲趟应时，在铲三遍地的时候，看庄稼长的真是喜盈盈。不幸，在苞米参蓼结棒的时候，一连四十五天没下雨，又在八月九日刮了一场大风，把苞米都刮得东倒西歪。虽然如此，我们的苞米这次还达到平均六成年景。单干户的苞米才达到四成。
    俺们全组的妇女也组织起来啦（十一个整劳力）。她们在春耕的时候，捻种滤粪，夏锄的时候拔混苗、薅草，捉害虫。挂锄的时候，拣粪及锅底烧土。他们专责的长期副业是喂猪、喂鸡、纺线等，从正月到现在，全组副业生产共收入东北币两亿五千九百万元。
    搞副业赚了钱买骡买牛买布
    由于副业收入大，全组生活上升很快，共买进骡一匹、牛两头、布四千二百一十尺，全组七十一口人，每人平均两套单衣，一套棉衣，全组共有被褥六十床。伪满时候，平均五口家一床被，半数的妇女，百分之八十的小孩，冬季没有棉衣。那时仅有两户的粮食够吃。刘福田说：“我在十六岁以前，从来没盖着被。给地主白干活，只管饭，从十七岁才开始挣钱，用一斤棉花做了一床小被。提起那时候，真是穷得可怜。如果没有共产党，没有毛主席，我们那有今天的幸福。”
    今年秋收后我们的农副业生产计划是：开粉房、跑运输、积肥、打猎及割苫房草、砍大柴卖等。总之，人力、畜力，总是适当运用，男女没有闲人，计划到明年三月，再完成东北币两亿元的副业收入。全体组员保证为完成副业生产计划努力。
    毛主席！组织起来力量是大的，石庙子村由于俺们互助组得利大，另外又发展了一个互助组，二十六个拨工组，共节余了三十个劳力，提高了生产，改善了生活，希望我们全中国的农民弟兄们，组织起来发展生产，使生活逐渐富裕起来。
