　　Labor-Management Cooperation for Good Production
    ——A Record of the Production Competition at Beijing Private Huadong Weaving Factory
    Wang Jing
    The "Production First" policy proposed by the First Workers' Representative Congress of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions has generated tremendous power. Most of the city's workers have been swept up in the production surge. This clear policy has not only revitalized various state-owned factories but has also gradually been implemented in some private factories. As the production and sales of industrial products have normalized, some private factories with better conditions have launched more enthusiastic production competitions under the principle of "mutual benefit for labor and capital." The private Huadong Weaving Factory is one of them.
    The Huadong Weaving Factory has twenty-two electric looms, all converted from manual looms. The machines still use wooden frames, and the machines do not rotate quickly, so production efficiency is about 15 percent lower than that of iron-frame electric looms. In the past, due to the poor quality of the machines, lower output was regarded as natural by both labor and management. However, since the trade union led the workers to voluntarily unite with the capitalists and called for "improving production," the thinking of both labor and management has changed. "We must find ways to increase production and quality, and achieve development of production and mutual benefit for labor and management, so as to increase wealth for the country!" This is the workers' idea. "The trade union is indeed not purely focused on welfare; it also leads workers to help the factory with production!" This is the new understanding of the capitalists towards the trade union.
    The factory trade union first proposed changing the piece-rate wage system to the progressive piece-rate wage system stipulated in the collective contract. Then, it began to brew and launch a production competition. First, a meeting of Party members and Youth League members was convened to educate Party members and Youth League members to play a backbone role in the production competition. The Party members and Youth League members recognized a truth: for the benefit of the working class and for the construction of the new China, they should make special efforts on the production front. Then, a general meeting of all workers was convened to inspire and mobilize workers to carry out a production competition. It was also explained that the competition was to improve output and quality, but it must be based on the principle of "mutual benefit for labor and capital," and emphasis should be placed on improving technology, rational division of labor, and close cooperation. The workers understood the significance of the competition, and their enthusiasm was high, and they enthusiastically responded to the call. At the labor-management consultation meeting on July 14, the workers' representatives proposed "launching a production competition." At this time, although the capitalists agreed, their confidence was not high. The workers' representatives immediately stated: In the production competition, labor discipline must be strengthened to ensure the improvement of product quality and quantity, and the fulfillment and striving to exceed the production plan. As a result, the capitalists' confidence increased, and Deputy Manager Zhang Zemin (the factory's actual person in charge) said: "I will definitely guarantee the supply of raw materials, not 'wait for the shaft,' and I will rely on the workers to improve the factory!" The workers were relieved of the concern about "waiting for the shaft," and both labor and management were very enthusiastic about production. A general production plan was set, with the factory proposing a monthly output of 550 bolts (converted to 81 cloth, the same below), and the workers setting their own target of 590 bolts. Individual production plans were also set, with the highest being 58 bolts per month and the lowest being 52 bolts. In the past, each person weaved a maximum of 52 bolts and a minimum of only 36 bolts per month.
    In August, the competition began, and the entire factory was mobilized. Labor discipline was greatly improved. The weaving workers not only worked hard themselves but also established mutual aid groups in each workshop to learn from each other and improve quality. The winding, spooling, wheeling, and sizing departments also actively cooperated. The winding workers proposed: "Do not waste thread ends, connect the thread ends well, and speed up the wheeling." The wheeling workers guaranteed: "We will definitely connect the thread ends well and not cause trouble for the weavers." The spooling workers stated: "The spools should be evenly made, and there should be no tangling during weaving." The sizing workers not only guaranteed not to delay the weaving of the yarn but also proposed "do not wait for the shaft on cloudy days, and the sized yarn should be neither soft nor hard." After finishing work, they also voluntarily went to the counter to help roll medicinal cloth. When workers met, they asked, "How much have you woven?" They also studied technology while eating. The workers also suggested changing to a larger pulley to speed up the machine. In the past, when the machine broke down, both large and small problems were referred to the technician for repair. Now, when small problems occur, the weavers repair them themselves.
    The production bulletin board issued by the trade union played a significant role in promoting production. The production quantity and the amount of defective cloth were announced on the bulletin board every day. After work, the workers rushed to the bulletin board to see who produced the most and the best quality, and they learned from them. Weaver Zhang Bingxin was a bit lax in production. After reading the bulletin board, he secretly stepped up his efforts and was determined not to fall behind, and as a result, he exceeded the production plan. The exhibition of defective products also played a great educational role. Zhang Hongzhe looked at a piece of defective cloth he had woven and said with great regret: "This is so embarrassing! I swear I will never weave defective cloth again!"
    Party members and Youth League members did play a leading role in the production competition. When setting the production plan, Party member Cai Wenzhong set it based on good machines, and it was the highest record in the factory—58 bolts. On the tenth day of the production competition, he gave the good machine to others, replaced it with two broken machines, and helped others watch and repair the machines. As a result, he also completed and exceeded the production plan. Party member Zhou Jixian (technician) was afraid of delaying production, so he rushed to repair the machine in the evening after the workers got off work and patiently explained the cause of the machine's failure and the repair process to the workers. The seven Youth League members also actually acted as production shock workers. On the production chart, the red lines indicating their production achievements always ran ahead.
    In this way, with the joint efforts of labor and management, the first month of the production competition achieved great results. The total output was 630 bolts, exceeding the original plan by more than 10 percent, and increasing by 37 percent compared to the average output of the factory in the previous three months (457 bolts). The quality was also improved: the defective product rate in July was 13.6 percent, and in August it was 10.4 percent, a decrease of 3.2 percent. Raw materials were also saved by 20 percent compared to before (calculated based on the amount of waste thread). In this way, the cost of the products was reduced: the medicinal cloth was reduced by 1.6 liang of millet per bolt, and the 81 cloth was reduced by 4 jin of millet per bolt. Due to the increase in output and quality, the wages of all workers in the factory also increased, and the factory's profits also increased. The highest increase in workers' wages was 40 percent, and the lowest increase was 20 percent. The factory's net profit was about 3,600 jin of millet, an increase of 140 percent compared to the net profit of 1,500 jin of millet in July. The capitalists' enthusiasm for management was even higher, and they built three new houses for spooling. Deputy Manager Zhang said at the production summary meeting: "Today our factory has achieved such results, entirely due to the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the efforts of the workers. I will definitely work as hard as the workers to manage the factory in the future!"
    In September, it was the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, and the actual number of working days was three days less than in August. Good yarn accounted for 80 percent in August, and substandard yarn accounted for 80 percent in September, which would certainly affect output. The production plan proposed by the factory was still 550 bolts. As a result of the shock work, the workers completed 625 bolts. The defective product rate was only slightly more than 1.5 percent, a decrease of 12 percent compared to July. The capitalists, who were moved by the workers' enthusiasm for production, had a clearer understanding of the policy. Deputy Manager Zhang wrote on the bulletin board: "Our legitimate industry and commerce have had the opportunity to develop after the government's economic measures and price stabilization this spring. We must recognize the government's policy, quickly break down our concerns, unite the workers and masses well, improve production, and strive for the country's economic construction!" The capitalists are now preparing to add winding, warping, and other machines to expand production.
    At present, there are still two urgent problems to be solved in the factory: one is that the reward system has not yet been specified, and the other is that the working hour system should be improved. The factory is carrying out a production competition based on the past daily working hours of 13 hours, which exceeds the working hours set by the collective contract, and even the holiday system of the big weekly rest is not available. These two problems have attracted the attention of the trade union and the factory, and they are studying improvement methods.

　　劳资协力搞好生产
    ——记北京私营华东织布工厂生产竞赛
    王敬
    北京市总工会第一次工人代表大会所提出的“生产第一”的方针，已经产生了巨大力量。全市工人，大部卷入了生产热潮。这一明确的方针，不仅使各公营工厂气象一新，而且在一些私营工厂中，也逐渐贯彻了这个方针。当工业品产销趋于正常后，一部分条件较好的私营工厂，在“劳资两利”的原则下，更热烈地展开了生产竞赛。私营华东织布工厂便是其中的一个。
    华东织布工厂有电力机二十二台，都是由人力机改装的。机床仍用木架，机器转动不快，生产效率比铁架电力机约低百分之十五左右。在过去，由于机器不好，产量少些，劳资双方也视为当然。可是，自从工会领导工人主动团结资方，号召“搞好生产”以后，劳资双方的思想都变了。“咱们要想法提高产量和质量，要做到发展生产，劳资两利，好给国家增加财富！”这是工人的念头。“工会果然不是单纯的福利观点，它也领导工人帮助工厂搞生产！”这是资方对工会的新认识。
    该厂工会先提出把计件工资制改为集体合同所规定的超额累进计件工资制。接着，便酝酿发动生产竞赛。首先召开党团员会议，教育党团员在生产竞赛中起骨干作用。党团员们认识了一个真理：为了工人阶级的利益，为了新中国的建设，自己在生产战线上应该特别努力。然后召开全体工人大会，启发鼓动工人开展生产竞赛运动。并说明竞赛是为了提高产量和质量，但一定要根据“劳资两利”的原则，重视改进技术，合理分工和密切配合。工人们懂得了竞赛的意义，情绪高涨，热烈响应了这个号召。在七月十四日的劳资协商会议上，工人代表提出“展开生产竞赛”。这时资方虽然赞成，但信心还不高。工人代表当即表示：在生产竞赛中，一定要加强劳动纪律，保证提高产品质量和数量，完成并争取超过生产计划。于是，资方的信心增高了，副经理张泽民（工厂实际负责人）说：“我一定保证供给原料，不‘等轴’，我要依靠工人来搞好工厂！”工人解除了“等轴”的顾虑，劳资双方的生产热情都非常高。订了总生产计划，厂方提出月产五百五十匹（折八一布，下同），工人自订五百九十匹。也订了个人生产计划，最高一月订五十八匹，最低五十二匹。过去每人每月最多织五十二匹，最少仅织三十六匹。
    八月份，竞赛开始了，全厂都动了起来。劳动纪律大大提高。织布工人不但自己努力，并在各车间成立互助小组，以工带徒、提高质量。打轴、打穗、轮轴、浆线等各部门，也都积极配合。打轴工人提出：“不浪费线头，把线头接好，使轮轴加快。”轮轴工人保证：“一定把线头接好，不给织工找麻烦。”打穗工人表示：“穗子要打得匀，决不叫织布时乱线。”浆线的工人不但保证不耽误织布用线，而且提出“阴天不等轴，浆出的线要不软不硬。”他们收了工以后，还自动到柜房帮忙卷药布。工人们见了面就问：“你织了多少？”吃着饭也研究技术，工人们还建议换一个大的皮带轮，使机器速度加快。以前机器坏了，不管大小毛病都找技师修理，现在发生小毛病，织工就自己动手来修。
    工会出的生产壁报，起了不少推动作用。生产数量，残布多少，每天都在壁报上公布。工人们下了工，便都跑到壁报前面，看谁生产的数量多，质量好，就向谁看齐。织工张炳新在生产中本来有点散漫，看了壁报以后，便暗中加劲，抱定“不落人后”的决心，结果超过了生产计划。废品展览也起了很大的教育作用，张洪哲看着自己织的一匹残布，很懊恼地说：“这多丢人呀！以后发誓再也不织残布了！”
    党团员在生产竞赛中确实起了带头作用。党员蔡文仲在订生产计划时，是按好机器订的，而且是全厂最高纪录—五十八匹。在开展生产竞赛的第十天，他把好机器让给别人，自己换了两台坏机器，并帮助别人看机器，修机器，结果还完成并超过了生产计划。党员周继贤（技师）怕耽误生产，在工人下班后，晚上赶修机器，并把机器坏的原因和修理的过程，耐心地讲给工人听。七个团员也实际当了生产突击手。在生产表上，标示他们生产成绩的红线，总是跑在前头。
    就是这样，在劳资共同努力之下，生产竞赛的第一个月，便获得了很大的成绩。总产量是六百三十匹，超过原计划的百分之十强，比工厂前三个月的平均产量（四百五十七匹）增加了百分之三十七。质量也提高了：七月份残品率为百分之一三·六，八月份是百分之一○·四，减低了百分之三·二。原料也比以前节省了百分之二十（根据残线多少计算）。这样，产品的成本便减低了：药布每匹减低一斤六两小米，八一布每匹减低四斤小米。由于产量、质量提高了，全厂工人的工资也提高了，工厂的利润也增多了。工人工资最高的增加百分之四十，最低的增加百分之二十。工厂净获纯利约三千六百斤小米，比七月份的纯利一千五百斤小米增加百分之一百四十。资方经营的热情更高了，新盖了三间打穗的房子。张副理在生产总结会议上说：“今天咱厂有这样成绩，完全是共产党正确的领导，和工人的努力。我今后一定和工人一样的努力经营！”
    九月份，赶上中秋节的假日，实际工作日比八月份少了三天。八月份好纱占百分之八十，九月份次纱占百分之八十，这当然会影响产量。厂方提出的生产计划仍是五百五十匹。突击工作的结果，工人们却完成了六百二十五匹。残品率仅仅占百分之一·五强，比七月份减低了百分之十二。被工人生产热情所感动的资方，对政策的认识更清楚了，张副理在壁报上写着：“我们正当工商业，在今春政府经济措施、物价稳定后，已经得到发展的机会。我们要认清政府的政策，赶快把顾虑打破，好好的团结职工群众，搞好生产，为国家经济建设而奋斗！”现在资方正准备添置打轴、整经等机器，以扩大生产。
    目前该厂还存在着两个亟待解决的问题：一是奖励制度尚未规定。二是工时制度应该改善。该厂开展生产竞赛，以过去的每日工作十三小时为准，这是超过集体合同所定的工时的，而且连大礼拜制的休假制度也没有。这两个问题，已引起了工会和厂方的注意，正在研讨改进办法。
