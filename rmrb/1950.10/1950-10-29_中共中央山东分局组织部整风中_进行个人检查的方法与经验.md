The rectification study of the Organization Department of the CCP Central Committee Shandong Branch, after examining and summarizing the work of the department and its sections, entered the personal ideological examination stage on October 11 and was completed on the 14th. The following is an introduction to the personal examination situation and experience of the department:

I. Problems Discovered in the Ideological Style of Cadres During the Examination

Through personal ideological examination, it was found that many cadres, to varying degrees, possessed and fostered a sense of pride and complacency. This sentiment hinders the improvement of work and the progress of cadres. Pride and complacency are mainly manifested in: some cadres being satisfied with past narrow experiences and the status quo of their work. Therefore, they are not proactive in learning, are insensitive to new things, and do not delve into or seek to improve their work. Some comrades believe they are veterans with a long revolutionary history, and are concerned about fame and status, and are not content with their work. Some believe that organizational work is not a specialized profession and has little prospect of advancement, and want to change jobs. Some emphasize that work in government offices is not practical work and cannot train cadres; or emphasize that their personal education level is low and they are not suitable for working in government offices, and therefore request to go down to lower levels for training, holding a temporary view of their work and lacking a long-term commitment to their careers. There are also a few comrades who believe that the work they are undertaking is "unpromising" and "has no future," unwilling to do big things and unwilling to do small things; when they see comrades who worked with them in the past being promoted, they become uneasy, thinking that their personal lack of promotion is due to the limitations of their working environment, and therefore are not active in their work and do things perfunctorily. Individual comrades are concerned about personal enjoyment of life, believing that after more than ten years of revolution, "if there is no merit, there is hard work," complaining that the Party does not take good care of them, and therefore respond to work passively, doing only what is assigned and getting by. In the examination of ideological style, after analysis and criticism, everyone has realized the root causes and harms of these thoughts, and thus there has been a preliminary shift in work enthusiasm.

II. How Was the Personal Examination Conducted?

(1) Sufficient mobilization was carried out beforehand: In the examination and summary of the department's work, most comrades felt the necessity of personal examination. Some comrades also began to consider their personal ideological style. After the examination of the work of the department and sections, leading cadres, in order to make everyone pay attention to personal examination, break down certain ideological concerns, and further carry out criticism and self-criticism, made another mobilization, and guided everyone in a preliminary discussion on personal examination. The concerns among the cadres have been largely eliminated. (2) The purpose, scope, and standards of personal examination were clearly defined. Before conducting the personal examination, Li Guangwen, deputy director of the department, explained the purpose, scope, and standards of the examination to all cadres of the department at a meeting, and made some analysis and criticism in connection with the ideological style problems of cadres exposed in the previous stage of examination work, so that everyone had a clear direction in the examination. The purpose of conducting personal examination as stipulated by the department is: to enable each comrade to have a relatively clear and systematic understanding of their ideological style, find out the main shortcomings and their root causes, and point out the direction of improvement, in order to achieve the goal of improving the ideological level of cadres and improving work. The scope of the examination is: ideological style problems that have a significant relationship with current work, are relatively prominent in the individual's case, and are sufficient to affect the implementation of policies and the improvement of work. It opposes putting all problems on an equal footing and conducting a general examination. It is also clearly stipulated that historical issues should not be examined; if they are directly related to current work, they can be discussed, but they should not be generally narrated; those with historical baggage should be relieved, but they should not be entangled in this issue. Do not examine life details and other trivial issues, and opinions can still be raised regarding issues related to leadership style. The standard for examination is the Party Program and the Party Constitution. Due to the above provisions, the examination can generally be carried out with a focus, and can be raised to the level of Party principles for analysis and criticism. Although the examination time is short, the main problems have been basically resolved, which has improved the ideological level of cadres. (3) The following points were noted in the method of personal examination: 1. Closely link with work, directly and frankly raise issues from the perspective of personal ideological style, analyze them, and put forward suggestions for improvement. 2. Prepare fully before the meeting. Generally, comrades wrote examination outlines, circulated them, and solicited opinions. Some sections conducted preliminary discussions in groups of two or three. Through such mutual enlightenment, everyone fully considered their own problems before the meeting, and when criticism and self-criticism were unfolded at the meeting, the problems were easily resolved, and the meeting time was shortened. 3. Individuals presented self-criticisms at group meetings, and everyone helped to analyze them; after the meeting, individuals sorted out and summarized, and the group did not make conclusions or assessments, in order to prevent the bias of "passing the test." 4. After the meeting, responsible comrades conducted individual talks to solicit opinions, in order to truly clear up thinking and prevent individual comrades from carrying new burdens due to criticism and self-criticism.

III. Two Points of Experience

(1) Conducting personal ideological examination is an important and meticulous step in the rectification campaign. If it is not properly controlled, it is easy to make deviations and even cause confusion. Therefore, leading cadres must clearly stipulate the purpose, scope, standards, and methods of examination in advance, and explain them clearly to everyone; during the process, they must pay close attention to control and prevent deviations at any time. The time should not be too long. According to the situation of the Organization Department, seven or eight people per section can be completed in about a week. This time, the time used by the department was too short (only four days), so that the analysis and criticism of some issues was not deep and meticulous enough.

(2) Whether personal examination can achieve the purpose of truly solving problems depends on the correct unfolding of criticism and self-criticism. The correct unfolding of criticism and self-criticism must pay attention to the following points: First, leading cadres must set an example. In the examination and summary of various tasks in the Organization Department, the responsible comrades of each section were generally able to conduct self-criticism in a realistic and pragmatic manner, which enlightened the general comrades and dispelled some concerns, so it was able to achieve considerable results. Second, in the process of criticism and self-criticism, self-criticism should generally be emphasized. Because the personal examination of the department this time was preceded by conversations and mutual assistance, everyone made relatively full preparations, so the self-criticism was better, and the spirit after the self-criticism was also more pleasant. However, for individual comrades who lacked the spirit of self-criticism, serious criticism must be carried out to help them further examine themselves. Third, in mutual criticism, it is necessary to expose erroneous ideas, but the good side should be correctly assessed; and more importantly, help analyze the root causes of errors, and explain the problem from the positive side, so that the criticized person not only recognizes the error, but also knows the way to improve. The attitude should be warm and sincere, in order to achieve the purpose of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and curing diseases to save people." Fourth, in criticism and self-criticism, we must proceed from specific circumstances, be realistic and pragmatic, and be appropriate in evaluating errors, neither exaggerating nor minimizing them, in order to correctly recognize and correct errors.

### 中共中央山东分局组织部整风中  进行个人检查的方法与经验

　　中共中央山东分局组织部整风中
    进行个人检查的方法与经验
    中共中央山东分局组织部的整风学习，经过对部的工作及科的工作检查总结，于十月十一日进入个人思想检查阶段，十四日检查完毕。今将该部个人检查的情况与经验介绍如下：
    一、检查中在干部思想作风上发现的问题
    经过个人思想检查，发现许多干部都或多或少的存在着和滋长着骄傲自满情绪。这种情绪阻碍着工作的改进和干部的进步。骄傲自满情绪主要表现在：一些干部满足于过去的狭隘经验和工作现状，因此，学习不够积极，对新鲜事物感觉迟钝，对工作不钻研不求改进。一些同志认为自己资格老，革命历史长，计较名誉地位，不安心工作。有的人认为组织工作不是专门业务，发展前途不大，想改行。有的人强调机关工作不是实际工作，不能锻炼干部；或强调个人文化水平低，不适于做机关工作，因而要求到下面去锻炼，对工作抱着临时观点，缺乏长期建设的事业心。也有少数同志认为自己所担负的工作“没出息”、“无前途”，大事作不了，小事不愿作；看到过去和自己在一块工作的同志被提拔了，自己便不安心，以为个人未被提拔是受了工作环境的限制，因而对工作不积极，敷衍了事。个别同志则计较个人生活享受，认为革命十多年，“没有功劳有苦劳”，埋怨党对自己照顾不够，因此对工作消极应付，分配一点作一点，得过且过。在思想作风的检查中，经过分析批判，大家都已认识到这些思想产生的根源及其危害性，因而工作情绪已有了初步转变。
    二、个人检查是怎样进行的？
    （一）事前进行了充分的动员：该部在检查总结工作中，多数同志已感到个人检查的必要。有的同志并开始对个人的思想作风作了考虑。在部、科工作检查完毕后，领导干部为了使大家重视个人检查，打破某些思想顾虑，进一步开展批评与自我批评，又作了一次动员，并引导大家进行了一次关于个人检查的酝酿讨论干部中的顾虑已大体消除。（二）明确规定了个人检查的目的、范围和标准。在进行个人检查以前，该部副部长李广文在部的全体干部会议上，向大家说明了检查的目的、范围和标准，并联系前段检查工作中暴露出的干部思想作风问题，作了一些分析批判，使大家在检查中有了明确的方向。该部所规定的进行个人检查的目的是：使每个同志对自己的思想作风有一个比较明确的、系统的认识，找出主要缺点及产生的根源，指出改进方向，以达到提高干部思想水平和提高工作的目的。检查的范围是：和目前工作有重大关系，在个人说来是比较突出的足以影响执行政策与提高工作的思想作风问题。反对把一切问题都平列起来，进行泛泛的检查。并明确规定不检查历史问题，如有与现在的工作直接发生联系者可以谈，但不可一般地叙述历史；有历史包袱的应解除，但不可纠缠在这一个问题上。不检查生活细节及其他琐碎问题，联系到领导作风的问题仍然可以提意见。检查的标准是党纲和党章。由于作了以上规定，检查中一般都能有重点地进行，并能提高到党的原则上来进行分析批判。检查的时间虽短，但主要问题已基本上得到解决，使干部思想水平提高了一步。（三）个人检查的方法注意了以下几点：１、紧密联系工作，直接了当的从个人思想作风上提出问题，进行分析并提出改进意见。２、会前充分准备。一般同志均写了检查提纲，互相传阅征求意见。有的科则二、三人在一起事先进行交谈。经过这样的互相启发，每个人对自己的问题在会前都作了充分考虑，会上展开批评与自我批评时，问题容易解决，并缩短了会议时间。３、小组会上个人提出检讨，大家帮助分析；会后个人整理总结，小组不作结论和鉴定，以防止发生“过关”的偏向。４、会后负责同志进行个别谈话，征求意见，以便确实打通思想，以防止个别同志因检讨批评而背上新的包袱。
    三、两点经验
    （一）进行个人思想检查，是整风中一个重要而细致的步骤，如掌握不好，容易发生偏差，甚至会造成混乱。因此，领导干部必须事先明确规定检查的目的、范围、标准和方法，并要向大家解释清楚；进行中又必须密切注意掌握，随时防止发生偏向。时间亦不宜过长。按照组织部的情况，每科七、八人，约一周时间即可。这次该部所用的时间太短（只四天），以致对有些问题的分析批判还不够深入细致。
    （二）个人检查能否达到真正解决问题的目的，关键在于正确展开批评与自我批评。而批评与自我批评的正确展开，必须注意以下几点：第一，领导干部以身作则。这次组织部在各种工作的检查总结中，各科的负责同志，一般的都能够实事求是地进行自我批评，这就对一般同志作了启发，解除了某些顾虑，因此，能收到相当的效果。第二，在进行批评与自我批评当中，一般的应强调自我批评。该部这次的个人检查，因事先经过交谈互助，每个人都作了比较充分的准备，因此，自我检讨较好，检讨后精神亦较愉快。但对个别自我批评精神很差的同志，则必须认真地进行批评，帮助其进一步检讨。第三，在互相批评中，揭发错误思想是必要的，但对好的一面应该正确估计；而更重要的还在于帮助分析错误的根源，从正面说明问题，使被批评者不仅认清错误，而且可以知道改进的办法。态度上要热情诚恳，以达到“惩前毖后、治病救人”的目的。第四，在批评与自我批评中，要从具体情况出发，实事求是，恰如其分，对错误不要扩大或缩小，以便正确认识错误，改正错误。
