Xinhua News Agency, 2nd of October: The full text of the letter from all the representatives of the National Conference of Model Workers, Peasants and Soldiers to Chairman Mao is as follows:

Dear Chairman Mao:

This time, the Central People's Government has summoned us, people of all kinds who were never valued in the old society, working in factories, rural areas, and the military, to Beijing for such a grand meeting, and we have received such a warm welcome and reception, which truly makes us feel infinitely honored! We have a belly full of words, and we don't know where to start. When we set off, everyone told us to pay our respects to you and ask how you are doing, so let us first, on behalf of everyone, give you our most affectionate salute!

Chairman Mao! Whenever we think of you, we cannot help but recall the darkness of the past! From our ancestors down to us, we have endured hardship, suffered humiliation, felt cold, gone hungry, been beaten, and been scolded, living a life worse than animals for who knows how many years. If it weren't for you, if it weren't for the Chinese Communist Party, we wouldn't even be able to survive, let alone talk about a glorious, happy, and joyful life!

It is all thanks to the wise leadership of the Communist Party and you that we have truly stood up, defeated the Japanese imperialists who invaded our country, and overthrown the running dog of American imperialism, the evil demon Chiang Kai-shek, and established a people's democratic dictatorship government. Only then did we truly become masters of the country, no longer suffering from being deceived, humiliated, beaten, and scolded as we did before. With the overthrow of bureaucratic capital, we in the factories have transformed from slaves controlled by machines into people who control machines. We are not only able to use our two hands to turn the machines, but also able to use our brains to find ways to improve the machines, produce more products, increase the wealth of the country, and improve our own lives. With the overthrow of the landlord class, we obtained land and were able to build water conservancy projects on our own land, work diligently, and produce more grain. We are not only no longer suffering from cold and hunger, but our lives are getting better day by day. With the overthrow of the dark, reactionary, corrupt, and degenerate Kuomintang rule, we, the intellectual workers engaged in various professions, have also gained the opportunity to utilize our knowledge and experience and participate in the great construction work together with the broad masses of people. We no longer have to fear unemployment, no longer have to endure humiliation and lower our heads to find a place to eat, and everyone with ability can receive the due attention and respect.

Chairman Mao! You are truly a sun. Your appearance has completely dispelled the dark and foul atmosphere. The people of the whole country, who have lived under darkness for a long time, can open their eyes, stand up straight, and move forward hand in hand towards the road of light and happiness under your illumination. You are truly our people's great savior!

It has only been a year since the victory of liberation, and everything has changed. Even many bad people have become good, and those who were good people have become even better today. When has anyone ever worked so vigorously? When has anyone ever helped and been so affectionate with each other? The only ones who haven't changed are the small handful of heartless traitors and national scum, who are still making trouble in Chiang's little court. Sooner or later, we will completely wipe them out. There is also a blood-sucking devil, American imperialism, which on the one hand supports the murderous demon Chiang Kai-shek, and on the other hand is flexing its muscles in Korea, and even sends planes to strafe us. Chairman Mao! We understand that these two ghosts are our mortal enemies at home and abroad. These two demons are afraid that we have become masters of the country, afraid that we will build the country well, and will not be able to come back to exploit us and drink our blood. They are bent on destroying us and want to break into our country's mainland again, issue gold yuan coupons and silver yuan coupons, open banks, and make a fortune; and in factories and mines, restore the whole set of foremen, looters, beatings, scoldings, body searches, insults, and teasing; and in rural areas, help landlords organize the home-returning corps, find a bunch of lackeys to serve as Bao and Jia chiefs, buy and sell strong men, and extort and blackmail us. They are really dreaming in broad daylight! They can't imagine that the new China has such unprecedented unity and strength. As long as you, Chairman Mao, say a word, none of our 475 million people will fail to step forward. We are the people who have suffered enough from the bullying of imperialism and know the value of national independence and autonomy best. We are the people who have lived enough of an oppressed life and know the value of freedom and democracy best. We are the working people and know the value of the fruits of labor best. We will never allow the robbers to come and plunder the fruits we have exchanged with blood.

Chairman Mao! You are so right! Our China does need to establish a strong national defense force and a strong economic force. We will certainly follow your instructions, unite all the people, and work together to accomplish these two major tasks. We keep every word you say in our hearts, and the path you have pointed out to us is the only correct path for the happiness of ourselves and our descendants. We workers firmly guarantee to you: We will certainly follow your instructions, respond to your call, unite all workers and all technical and management personnel, launch production competitions, strive to learn culture and technology, improve output and quality, reduce costs, and complete the production tasks given by the state. We farmers firmly guarantee to you: We must organize ourselves better in the future, implement mutual aid and cooperation, cultivate diligently, improve technology, build water conservancy projects, plant trees and forests, prevent floods, droughts, and insect pests, and strive for rich harvests. We soldiers firmly guarantee to you: We will certainly give higher play to the nature of the people's army, learn culture, improve military technology, and complete the production tasks we should undertake, to save state expenditure and increase state wealth.

We, all the representatives, guarantee to you: After we go back, we will never be arrogant and complacent, we will certainly learn with humility, continue to learn tirelessly from the broad masses of people, so as to contribute greater strength to the motherland, and not disgrace the glorious title given to us by the people. We will certainly always remember the three roles you have already instructed us to play: We must be the leaders of the masses, the core backbone of the masses, and the bridge between the leadership and the masses, so as to promote the victorious advance of people's cause in all aspects! We shout:

Long live the eternal victory of the people's liberation cause!
Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live the organizer and leader of the Chinese people's liberation cause—the Chinese Communist Party!
Long live our leader and mentor, our dearest Chairman Mao!
All Representatives of the National Conference of Model Workers, Peasants and Soldiers

　　全国劳模代表会议
    向毛主席致敬
    将忠诚和敬意献给自己的领袖！
    【新华社二日讯】全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议全体代表致毛主席信全文如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    这回中央人民政府把我们这些在旧社会里从来不被人重视的，在工厂、农村里和部队中工作的各种各样的人，召到北京来开这么大的一个会，受到这么热烈的欢迎和招待，真使我们感到无上的荣耀！我们有满肚子的话，不知道从那里说起。我们动身的时候，大伙都叫我们向您致敬，问问您好，就让我们首先代表大伙向您致一个最亲热的敬礼吧！
    毛主席！我们大伙平素一念到您，就不由地回想到过去的黑暗！从祖先起直到我们手上，吃苦、受气、挨冻、挨饿、挨打、挨骂，也不知过了多少岁月的牛马不如的生活。如果没有您，没有中国共产党，我们连活都活不下去了，还说得到什么光荣、幸福、快乐的生活！
    全靠有共产党和您的英明领导，我们大伙才真正翻了身，把侵占我们祖国的日本帝国主义打败了，把美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石恶魔也打倒了，建立了人民民主专政的政府，我们才真正做了国家的主人，再也不像从前那样受欺、受气、挨打、挨骂了。把官僚资本推翻了，我们在工厂里才从被机器管制的奴隶，变成了管制机器的人，我们就不仅能够使用两只手来转动机器，而且能够开动脑筋，想方设法来改良机器，生产更多的产品，增加国家的财富和改善我们自己的生活。把地主阶级打倒了，我们获得了土地，才能够在自己的土地上兴修水利，勤劳耕作，打得更多的粮食，我们不仅不再挨冻受饿，而且生活得一天比一天好了。把黑暗反动、贪污腐化的国民党统治推翻了，我们从事各种职业的脑力劳动者，也才获得了发挥我们的知识经验，与广大群众一道，参加伟大建设工作的机会，我们再也不要害怕没有职业了，再也不要忍辱受气、低首下心去寻找自己吃饭的位子了，而且每一个有本领的人，都能得到应有的重视，应有的尊敬了。
    毛主席啊！您真是个太阳，您一出现，那种乌烟瘴气的黑暗就被完全驱散了。长期生活在黑暗下面的全国人民，一经您的照耀，都能够睁开眼睛，挺起身来，手牵着手，向着光明幸福的道路前进，您真是我们人民的大救星啊！
    解放胜利以后，不过一年，什么事情都改变了，连许多坏人都变好了，原来是好人的，今天变得更好了，先前有谁干活干得这样起劲过？有谁这样互相帮助、互相亲热过？至今没有变的，只有那一小撮没有人心的汉奸、卖国贼，还躲在蒋家小朝庭里瞎闹，咱们早晚要把他们彻底歼灭掉。另外还有一个喝血鬼美帝国主义，一面支持杀人魔鬼蒋介石，另一面又在朝鲜张牙舞爪，还派飞机到我们头上来扫射。毛主席！我们是明白的，如今国内外就只有这两个鬼东西是我们的死对头。这两个魔鬼怕我们当了国家的主人，怕我们把国家搞好了，不能回来剥削我们，喝我们的血了，就一心想破坏我们，想再闯进我们国家的大陆上来，再发金元券、银元券，开银行，发混财；在工厂、矿山里恢复把头、搂包、打骂、搜身、侮辱、调戏这一全套；在农村里帮助地主组织还乡团，弄一批狗腿子来当保甲长，买卖壮丁，敲诈勒索我们。他们真在白天作梦呢！他们想不到新中国有这样空前的团结与壮大，我们四亿七千五百万人，只要您，毛主席一句话，没有一个人不上前的。我们是受够了帝国主义欺侮的人，最知道国家独立自主的可贵，我们是过够了被压迫生活的人，最知道自由民主的可贵，我们是劳动人民，最知道劳动成果的可贵，我们用血换来的果实，决不允许强盗们再来抢夺去的。
    毛主席！您说得真对！我们中国的确需要建立强大的国防军，建立强大的经济力量。我们一定遵从您的指示，团结全体人民，协同努力，来完成这两件大事。您说的话，我们句句记在心里，您指给我们的道路，是我们为自己和子孙幸福的惟一正确的道路。我们工人向您坚决保证：一定遵照您的指示，响应您的号召，团结全体工友和一切技术、管理人员，展开生产竞赛，努力学习文化和技术，提高产量和质量，降低成本，完成国家给予的生产任务。我们农民坚决向您保证：我们今后一定要更好地组织起来，实行互助合作，勤劳耕种，提高技术，兴修水利，植树造林，防止水灾、旱灾、虫灾，争取丰富的收成。我们士兵坚决向您保证：我们一定更高地发挥人民军队的本质，学习文化，提高军事技术并完成我们应当担负的生产任务，来节省国家开支，增加国家财富。
    我们全体代表向您保证：我们回去以后，决不骄傲自满，一定虚心学习，继续不疲倦地向广大群众学习，以便为祖国贡献更大的力量，不辱没人民给予我们的光荣称号。我们一定时时记着您早已指示过的，我们应当起的三个作用：我们一定要作群众的带头人，作群众的核心骨干，作领导与群众之间的桥梁，以便推动各方面的人民事业胜利前进！我们高呼：
    人民解放事业永远胜利万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民解放事业的组织者和领导者——中国共产党万岁！
    我们的领袖和导师，最亲爱的毛主席万岁！
          全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议全体代表
                  十月二日
