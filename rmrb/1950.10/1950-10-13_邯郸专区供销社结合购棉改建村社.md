Handan Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative Combines Cotton Purchase with Village Cooperative Reconstruction

[Handan Special District News] In order to complete this year's cotton purchase task, the Handan Special District Cooperative and the cooperatives of various counties have made a series of preparations. Cooperatives at all levels in the special district have now begun purchasing cotton and supplying farmers with essential goods for life and production. In the process of purchasing cotton, village cooperatives have been newly built and reconstructed, and membership has been developed.

The county cooperatives have organized 100 cotton purchasing stations (excluding village cooperatives). In order to properly distinguish cotton grades and ensure cotton quality, the county cooperatives have trained 160 technicians to take on cotton purchasing tasks at various stations. At the same time, the county cooperatives hired a group of old cotton graders, provided them with grading training, and solved the difficulty of lacking technical personnel.

In addition, specific plans and arrangements have been made for cotton processing, transportation, security, and prevention of damage and waste.

As new cotton enters the market, farmers' purchases of essential goods for production and life have gradually increased. Farmers' demands for grain and fertilizer are even more urgent. The special district cooperative has allocated 1.81 million jin of soybean cake from the provincial cooperative and 5.4 million jin of soybean cake received from the grain company, which has been distributed to farmers through county cooperatives through methods such as loans, sales, and exchanges. The special district cooperative allocated a portion of grain to each county cooperative and signed a contract with the bank to borrow money to buy a portion of grain to meet the food needs of cotton farmers. The county cooperatives also independently adjusted a portion of grain.

Taking advantage of the favorable conditions of cotton purchase, the county cooperatives have all paid attention to the work of transforming and building cooperatives. According to incomplete statistics, 108 village cooperatives were newly built and transformed in August; 46,879 new members were developed, and there are now 540,758 cooperative members in the entire district. Most of the county cooperatives held training courses to implement the spirit of democratic cooperative construction, and members' understanding gradually improved. After the establishment of the new cooperatives, democratic management organizations were generally established from the bottom up.

　　邯郸专区供销社结合购棉改建村社
    【邯郸专区讯】邯郸专区合作社与各县合作社为完成今年的收棉任务，作了一系列的准备工作。该专区各级合作社现已开始收购棉花，供给农民生活、生产必需品。并在购棉过程中，增建和改造了村社，发展了社员。
    各县社已组织收花站一百处（不包括村社）。为了适当分别棉花等级，保证棉花质量，各县社训练了一百六十名技术员，分赴各站担任收花任务。同时各县社又雇用了一批旧验花手，给以分级训练，解决了缺乏技术人员的困难。
    另外，对棉花加工、运输、保卫、防止伤耗等工作，都作了具体计划和布置。
    随着新花上市，农民购买生产、生活必需品的已逐渐增多。农民对于粮食、肥料的要求更为迫切。专区社将由省社拨来的一百八十一万斤豆饼和从粮食公司接收的五百四十万斤豆饼，已通过各县社，以贷、卖、换等方式，调剂到农民手里。专区社拨给各县社一部粮食，专区社又与银行订立合同，贷款买到一部粮食，以调剂棉农的食粮需要。各县社也自行调剂了部分粮食。
    各县社通过购棉的有利条件，都注意了改造与建社工作。据不完全统计，在八月份即增建与改造村社一百零八处；新发展社员四万六千八百七十九人，全区合作社社员现有五十四万零七百五十八人。大部县社召开了训练班，贯彻了民主建社的精神，社员认识逐渐提高。在新社建立后，民主管理的组织一般都自下而上的建立了起来。
