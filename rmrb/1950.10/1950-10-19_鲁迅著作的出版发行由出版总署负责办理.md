Xinhua News Agency, 18th: In order to publish and distribute Lu Xun's works in large quantities both domestically and abroad, Ms. Xu Guangping, a member of Lu Xun's family and the person in charge of the original Complete Works of Lu Xun Publishing House, and Mr. Zhou Haiying have decided to entrust the publication and distribution of Lu Xun's works to the General Administration of Publications of the Central People's Government. After accepting this task, the General Administration of Publications has hired Feng Xuefeng and others to begin the work of collating, editing, and annotating Lu Xun's works.

Lu Xun's rich works are one of the most precious spiritual assets of the Chinese people. During his thirty-three years of writing, Lu Xun wrote, edited, translated, proofread, and compiled manuscripts estimated to be over ten million words. The twenty-volume Complete Works of Lu Xun was compiled by the Lu Xun Commemorative Committee in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War and first published in Shanghai in June 1938. It contained Lu Xun's selected "Thirty-Year Collection" and most of Lu Xun's translations, totaling more than six million words. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, in October 1946, the Complete Works of Lu Xun was republished in Shanghai. The Guanghua Bookstore in the Northeast Liberated Area printed the Northeast edition of the Complete Works of Lu Xun in September 1948. In December 1948, the Shanghai Writers' Bookstore rented the printing plates from the Complete Works of Lu Xun Publishing House and printed another edition. The content of these four editions is generally the same. As for the various single-volume editions published by the Complete Works of Lu Xun Publishing House successively, and those reprinted in various places, there are no statistics.

Works not included in the Complete Works that have been published in recent years include "Lu Xun's Letters," published by the Complete Works of Lu Xun Publishing House in 1946; "Supplement to the Complete Works of Lu Xun," published by the Shanghai Publishing Company in October 1946; and "Lu Xun's Lost Works," a total of four types, of which "The Picture of the Novel Cement" and "Selected Woodcuts" have been published by the Shanghai Publishing Company in September 1950.

As for foreign language translations of Lu Xun's works, the earliest published was the Japanese version of the Complete Works of Lu Xun translated by the Japanese Creation Society. The earliest Russian translation was "The True Story of Ah Q," published in Moscow in 1938, with a new translation by Rogov published in Shanghai in 1947. In 1945, the Russian translation of "Selected Short Stories of Lu Xun" was published in Leningrad. This year, a new translation of "Selected Short Stories of Lu Xun" was published in Moscow, with a print run of 150,000 copies. In addition, translations of Lu Xun's works have been published in English, American, French, German, and Eastern European countries. Domestically in China, there is also an Esperanto translation of "The True Story of Ah Q."

　　鲁迅著作的出版发行由出版总署负责办理
    【新华社十八日讯】为了使鲁迅著作在国内外大量出版发行，鲁迅先生的家属、原鲁迅全集出版社负责人许广平女士和周海婴先生决定将鲁迅著作的出版发行工作交由中央人民政府出版总署负责办理。出版总署在接受了这个任务以后，已聘请冯雪峰等着手进行鲁迅著作的校订编刊和注释工作。鲁迅的丰富著作，是中国人民最珍贵的精神财产之一。鲁迅在其三十三年的著作生活中，所写作、编辑、翻译、校勘、辑印的文稿，估计当在一千万字以上。二十卷的鲁迅全集，是在抗日战争初期，由鲁迅先生纪念委员会编纂，于一九三八年六月在上海初版印行的，其中包含了鲁迅自选的《三十年集》和鲁迅的大部分的译著，全书计六百余万字。在抗日战争结束后的一九四六年十月，鲁迅全集在上海再版出书。东北解放区的光华书店，在一九四八年九月印行了鲁迅全集的东北版。一九四八年十二月，上海作家书屋又向鲁迅全集出版社租了纸型，印行了一版。这四种版本内容大体相同。至于各种单行本由鲁迅全集出版社先后印行的，以及在各地翻印的，尚无统计。全集所未收入的著作，在近年出版的有《鲁迅书简》，一九四六年由鲁迅全集出版社印行；《鲁迅全集补遗》，一九四六年十月由上海出版公司印行；《鲁迅遗编》共四种，已出《小说士敏土之图》、《版画选集》二种，一九五○年九月由上海出版公司印行。至于鲁迅著作的外文译本，出版最早的为日本创造社翻译的日文本大鲁迅全集。俄文译本最早的是《阿Ｑ正传》，一九三八年在莫斯科出版，一九四七年又有罗果夫的新译本在上海出版。一九四五年在列宁格勒出版了《鲁迅小说选集》的俄译本。今年在莫斯科又出版了《鲁迅小说选集》的新译本，印数达十五万部。此外，在英美法德和东欧国家都有鲁迅著作的译本出版。在中国国内并有《阿Ｑ正传》的世界语译本。
