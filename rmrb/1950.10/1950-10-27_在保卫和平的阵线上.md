　　On the Front Lines of Defending Peace
    The people of Czechoslovakia are actively preparing for the Second World Peace Congress. The regions of Silina and Banska Pestiliga have already elected representatives to attend the Second World Peace Congress. Tens of thousands of workers in the Banska Pestiliga region have undertaken peace labor obligations and have already overproduced goods worth 4,735,342 crowns.
    In the city of Bienna, Italy, hundreds of radio listeners sent letters to the Italian Broadcasting Corporation requesting the cancellation of daily war propaganda programs. Public opinion in all Italian cities is exposing journalists who instigate war, and many mass organizations have protested to the editorial offices of reactionary newspapers.
    The British pacifist organization "Peace Pledge Union" recently protested the British government's refusal to issue entry visas to members of the preparatory committee of the World Peace Congress and opposed the stationing of American bombers in Britain.
    In Greece, secret peace committees have been established in many cities. More than 15,000 peace signatures have been collected in Athens. All the workers in a factory in Piraeus signed. Members of the Piraeus Committee of the Left-Wing Free Youth participated in the movement to defend peace. In five villages in Thrace, 4,700 people signed. The peace movement has spread to the royalist fascist army, and 280 signatures have been collected in a certain unit.
