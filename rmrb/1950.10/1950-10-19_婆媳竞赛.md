　　Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law Competition
　　Chang Gengxi

　　Mother Song is forty years old this year. Not only in this village, but within a radius of three to five li, everyone knows that she is a skilled worker. After Mother Song gave birth to her son Ertang, her husband died, so she had to do all the work at home. Recently, people in the village have been saying that Song Da Niang's son is getting married.

　　Ertang is just twenty years old this year. He is an active member of the village's Communist Youth League, and he is also very smart. He is in love with Jinwa, a female member of the Communist Youth League from Xiaoniuzhuang; she is very capable of working in the fields. They often meet at League meetings and know each other well; after an introduction, neither of them had any objections. Ertang discussed it with his mother, and his mother was very happy, because this girl is known to be a capable child not only in Xiaoniuzhuang, but also in nearby villages. She is plump and strong, and one year younger than Ertang.

　　The wedding date of Ertang and Jinwa arrived, and many men, women, old and young people squeezed in to watch this new-style wedding of the two Communist Youth League members. The courtyard inside and outside was packed. The couplets written on the gate were: "Four taels match four taels, half a catty matches half a catty," "Model matches hero, production is even more vigorous." On this day, the Yangko teams from Xiaoniuzhuang and this village twisted for a while, and everyone was very happy. The old uncles and old aunts all said: "Free marriage is good; this is all Chairman Mao's good idea."

　　The happy event passed. The next day, after breakfast, Mother Song wanted to go to the field to pick cotton and let Jinwa do needlework at home first. But Jinwa also wanted to go. She hadn't been to the fields for a few days, and the cotton was dazzlingly white. Mother Song thought, "Jinwa can't compare with me when it comes to working in the fields. Today, I will have a competition with her." So, the two went to the field. At the beginning, Jinwa picked slowly, but seeing her mother-in-law picking as if she were grabbing something, moving forward from one row to another, Jinwa immediately thought that her mother-in-law wanted to compete with her, so she put in her strength, and soon picked ahead of her mother-in-law. When her mother-in-law saw that her daughter-in-law was picking ahead of her, she became anxious and also picked hard. After competing for a long time, the two straightened up and laughed "puchi." It turned out that Jinwa had already picked three bolls, and Song Da Niang had barely picked two bolls after rushing. Song Da Niang said, "You pick so fast!" At noon, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law carried a large bundle of cotton home. On the way, Jinwa said, "Mother! This stuff is valuable, let's plant more next year." Mother replied, "Needless to say, we planted more than two mu this year, and we will also leave the two mu in Dongwa, which we originally planned to plant wheat, to plant cotton." The two went back laughing and talking.

　　On the third day, Ertang went to do substitute farming for others. After breakfast, Jinwa still asked her mother-in-law what work there was to do. Mother Song felt that she had worked for a day yesterday and was afraid that she would be tired, so she didn't want her to go. But Jinwa said, "Mother, I don't feel tired at all. We are working people, and we can't stand being idle at home." Mother Song had no choice but to push the cart with her to the field to haul corn stalks. While walking to the field, Mother Song thought again, "She will definitely not be as good as me at pushing the cart. Let's see when we get to the field." Once in the field, Jinwa asked Mother Song to hold the cart while she loaded it, loading thirteen bundles of corn stalks in a row. Mother Song could only push seven at a time. This time, seeing her load thirteen, she was really shocked. After loading, Mother Song wanted to push it a couple of steps first, but she couldn't even lift the handle, so she had to let Jinwa pull the cart back. When they arrived in the village, people saw the new daughter-in-law pushing so many corn stalks and praised her, some saying, "How capable the new daughter-in-law is! Pushing such a full cart, she is even stronger than Song Da Niang's Ertang." Mother Song was so happy that she didn't know what to say, just smiling and saying, "You don't know, she's a League member!"

　　婆媳竞赛
    常庚西
    宋大娘今年四十岁了。这人不用说本村，就是方圆三里五里以内的人也都知道她是劳动能手。大娘生了儿子二堂后，丈夫就死了，因此家里的活都得靠她干。最近，村里的人传说，宋大娘的儿子要结婚了。
    二堂今年刚二十岁，是村里的青年团员，工作积极，长得也很灵俐。他已和小牛庄的一个女团员锦娃恋爱了；她很能作地里的活。他俩因团里经常开会，常在一块，谁也知道谁；经人一介绍，二人都没意见。二堂跟娘一商量，娘很高兴，因为这闺女不用说小牛庄，就是附近的村子也都知道是个能干的孩子，人长得胖壮，比二堂小一岁。
    二堂与锦娃的结婚日期到了，许多男女老幼都挤来看这对青年团员的新式结婚。院里院外挤了个不透风。大门上写的对联是：“四两配四两，半斤配半斤”，“模范配英雄，生产更起劲。”这一天，小牛庄和本村的秧歌队扭了一阵，大家甚为高兴。老大伯老大娘们都说：“自由结婚就是好；这全是毛主席的好主意。”
    喜事过去了。第二天吃过了早饭，宋大娘要到地里摘棉花，让锦娃先在家做针线活。可是锦娃也要去。几天没到地里，棉花白得耀眼。宋大娘想：“地里作活，锦娃怎也比不上我，今天要和她赛赛看。”于是，二人到了地里。开始时，锦娃不紧不慢的摘，可是见婆婆跟抢夺什么似的，一钻一钻往前摘。锦娃一下想到婆婆想跟自己竞赛，就使上劲，一会儿就摘到婆婆的头里。婆婆见媳妇摘到自己头里，心里着了急，也是吃劲地摘着。赛了老半天之后，二人直腰一看，都噗嗤地笑了。原来这时锦娃已摘了三挂，宋大娘紧赶慢赶才摘了两挂。宋大娘说：“你摘的真快！”晌午了，婆媳背了一大包袱棉花回家。在路上，锦娃说：“娘！这东西可值钱呀，明年咱们可再多种上点。”娘回答说：“那还用说，今年种了二亩多，明年把东洼里原打算种麦子的二亩也留下种棉。”两人有说有笑地回去了。
    第三天，二堂去给人家代耕。吃过早饭，锦娃还是先问娘有啥活。宋大娘觉得她昨天干了一天，怕她累，就不愿让她去。锦娃却说：“娘，我一点都不觉累，咱是作活的人，在家里闲待着更受不住。”宋大娘只好与她推上小车到地里推玉茭秸。往地里走时，宋大娘又想：“推车子她准比不上我，到地里再看吧。”一到地里，锦娃让宋大娘给扶着车子，自己往车上装，一连装了十三捆玉茭秸。宋大娘每次只能推七个，这回见她装了十三个，真吃了一惊。装好后，宋大娘想先推两步，可是连车把都提不起来，只好给锦娃拉上车子往回走。到了村里，人们看见新媳妇推着这样多玉茭秸，都夸奖起来，有人说：“新媳妇多么能干！推着这样满满的车子，比宋大娘的二堂还有劲哩。”宋大娘乐的不知说啥好，只是笑着说：“你们不知道，人家是个团员哩！”
