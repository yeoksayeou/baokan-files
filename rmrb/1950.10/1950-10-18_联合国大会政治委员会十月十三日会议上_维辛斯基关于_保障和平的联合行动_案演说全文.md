Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 16th: Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky delivered a speech on the "United Action for Peace" proposal at the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on October 13th. The full text is as follows:

　　As we conclude the debates of the past few days, it is my turn to speak. The topic of this debate is of great concern to everyone who truly believes that the United Nations' mission is to prevent the threat of new wars, consolidate peace, and safeguard the security of all nations.

　　Up to now, many speeches have been made on the seven-nation proposal – the "United Action for Peace" proposal – and participation in the discussion has been extremely enthusiastic – a fact we can only welcome. If we look at it from this perspective, it is natural to see that this issue is of concern to everyone. I say this not specifically referring to the "seven-nation" proposal, but to the issue itself, the topic that constitutes the entire debate on the "seven-nation" proposal; I am referring to the various views expressed by national delegations on this issue.

　　During this important discussion, ample attention has been given to the views presented by the Soviet delegation, and to the suggestions that the Soviet delegation believes, now and in the past, must be upheld in order to contribute to the great cause of strengthening peace and international security. I think it is not an overstatement if I particularly emphasize this point.

　　In this regard, I must first mention some speeches that we cannot but consider to be so disharmonious with the general attitude to the point of rudeness, and in my opinion, it is this general attitude that allows us to discuss this issue together here. I say rude because it is not only rude and unacceptable in form, but also extremely unfair in essence. Because these speeches are playing with the facts, distorting historical facts, and fabricating history. I am now referring to a speech that, if not for the following two circumstances, could simply be ignored entirely, without giving it any attention: one circumstance is that some people deem it necessary to inject a motive that cannot be proven to be peace-loving into this serious and important issue, and it is precisely for the discussion of this issue that we are meeting here, and it is precisely for this issue that the United Nations organization has its reason for existence.

　　The second circumstance is that when they do this, they do not hesitate to crudely distort the facts.

　　I am now referring to the speech by the representative of Bolivia; I must respond to this speech.

　　In my first speech, I pointed out that the Soviet Union is unswervingly implementing a policy of peace, and is striving for the victorious realization of this policy in all its actions – great actions – and in all the issues on which the Soviet Union calls for the United Nations to support. I mentioned Marshal Stalin's statement in 1936, and I quoted his words at the time.

　　You all must remember how intolerably shameless and rude the Bolivian representative's comments on this issue were. I dismiss such rudeness with contempt and indignation. But the Bolivian representative said: that was in 1936, and now, he said, times have changed, and the tone is different.

　　A partial answer has already been given to his words. I can almost say that even in the sharp debates that often occur in our meetings, his words have never been heard before, and there is almost no precedent for them in the history of our United Nations organization. However, if more recent facts than 1936 are needed, I am able to recount them.

　　I can recount some more recent facts that will tell us what the true meaning of this clamor of that gentleman from Bolivia is. First, I want to recount the facts of 1938, when the Soviet government suggested to the major powers that consultations be held immediately, both within and outside the League of Nations, to discuss the practical measures that the Soviet government at that time considered necessary to stop the further development of Hitler's aggression and to eliminate the new war crisis that had increased as a result of Hitler's aggression.

　　Thus, the Soviet government took the initiative to raise this very important issue in 1938; suggesting measures to prevent Hitler's aggression. Everyone remembers very clearly – and I do not need to remind everyone – that Hitler's aggression eventually led to World War II. However, what was the result of the Soviet government's peaceful steps?

　　For example, the British government's note in response to the Soviet government's suggestion showed that the British government did not consider this suggestion welcome, or more precisely, it did not consider it welcome to prevent the implementation of Hitler's aggression plans.

　　I only need to point out the following: the British response to our suggestion for an emergency meeting of the four powers to take the necessary measures stated that the British government did not believe that holding a meeting to discuss preventing aggression with "concerted action" would necessarily benefit the prospects for peace in Europe.

　　Gentlemen, the result was Munich, I will only say this one word about it, and will not go into more detail.

　　I am talking about this now in order to illustrate that in any discussion of any issue, certain gentlemen who attack the Soviet government's foreign policy must not use their ignorance as an excuse, and even more so, they must not use it as an excuse to fabricate facts. This may not even be understood by the ignorant. But this is exactly what the ignorant deserve!

　　We can also cite another fact: in 1939, the Soviet government once again suggested holding a meeting of representatives from six countries – Britain, France, Romania, Poland, Turkey, and the Soviet Union – to formulate measures to deal with the aggression of the Hitler gang in Romania. I want to emphasize that the purpose of the meeting of the six countries – Britain, France, Romania, Poland, Turkey, and the Soviet Union – was to take measures to deal with the aggression of the Hitler gang in Romania, which was being prepared at the time. The British government had precise materials on this fact.

　　British Ambassador Seeds in Moscow avoided answering what attitude Britain would take if the Hitler gang attacked Romania when the Soviet government was negotiating with the British government on this issue. Mr. Seeds answered very vaguely, saying: "Romania is closer to the Soviet Union than to Britain," so he stood by and did nothing. The fact now is that Korea and China are far away from Britain, and it would be logical if the British representative were to say "previous example may be followed."

　　But they are now silent about this.

　　That was the situation in 1939. This is the fact, the historical fact that some willful representatives are trying to distort.

　　Finally, I also want to recount some other facts. No, this is not me recounting – Mr. Dulles has already recounted them. He just recounted that in San Francisco in 1945, the Soviet government opposed the wording of Article 10 of the United Nations Charter for a long time, but later agreed and accepted the wording suggested by the majority of the meeting. This is true. This really happened. But it must be explained further. This fact occurred as a result of negotiations, especially the negotiations between Washington and Moscow at that time, that is, between Stettinius (the US Secretary of State at the time) and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. This negotiation provided sufficient reason for actually making this concession. But doesn't this fact in 1945 illustrate that the Soviet Union is willing to cooperate, and even willing to withdraw some demands that would hinder this cooperation? This fact in 1945 is excellent evidence that the Soviet Union is consistently seeking ways to cooperate, and is willing to make concessions to its partners, of course, this is within a certain limit, of course not unlimited, and of course not in the situation where others exert pressure, either overtly or covertly, on the Soviet Union's will and force the Soviet Union to accept their own demands. They forget that the Soviet Union is not a suitable object for this kind of experiment, forgetting that "one should choose a corner farther away from the Soviet palace to carry out this kind of trickery."

　　I think the facts are enough to silence the slanderers of the Bolivian representative. The Bolivian representative tried to vilify the Soviet Union's peace policy here, and painstakingly invented various fabrications about events related to the Soviet Union's interests, and not only about events related to the Soviet Union's interests – the Romanian event is an example – but also made various fabrications about the interests of other countries that had fought hard against Hitler's aggression. The Bolivian representative concealed the situation at the time, that is, the change of the Romanian government occurred when the Soviet army was launching an offensive towards Berlin, and former General Radescu and former King Michael were still trying to undermine the Soviet rear, that is, the Soviet army's rear, in order to hinder this offensive.

　　Now, I want to turn to the essence of the issue we are discussing here. Naturally, I cannot cover everything that has been mentioned here. I want to choose some major topics. I would like to talk about the main opponents, that is, the main drafters of this "seven-nation" proposal. I would like to focus my attention on this proposal first.

　　First, it would be strange if anyone thought that objecting to this section or that section of an amendment to this proposal could prove disloyalty to the claims made in the proposal. Someone said, "We were greatly disappointed when Vyshinsky suddenly began to criticize our proposal." They didn't like our criticism. However, we must criticize what needs to be criticized and accept what we think is acceptable. This is completely natural and legitimate.

　　Therefore, it is surprising to pursue unspoken thoughts just because someone has expressed opinions on certain paragraphs considered important that the original drafters did not clearly express, and other proposals have been put forward.

　　In discussing the "seven-nation" proposal, some representatives repeatedly mentioned the Soviet delegation's views on this issue when expressing their positions.

　　I think it is also necessary to talk about the speeches that aim to refute our arguments and views. I must say that although we and the drafters of the "seven-nation" proposal all share the same goal – to guarantee measures that can guarantee the consolidation of peace and the security of all countries – we differ from them in principle.

　　Where do we start from? Where did the drafters of the "seven-nation" proposal start from when they put forward this proposal? I think I made this very clear last time. If you will allow me to talk about this for a few minutes, please allow me to do so.

　　The Soviet delegation and the delegations of various countries that support our claims believe that the drafters of the "seven-nation" proposal start from a false premise – I emphasize, a false premise – that the Security Council may fall into a situation where it cannot exercise its functions, and that this situation has already occurred and will inevitably occur, simply because the Security Council has been tested by a certain privilege, the exercise of which is said to hinder the exercise of the Security Council's functions.

　　According to the logic of the objections raised by our opponents, that is, the supporters of the "seven-nation" proposal, one would have to admit that the rights and privileges granted to the Security Council at the San Francisco Conference themselves hinder it from performing its functions. If this is admitted, one would believe that despite the painful memories of the League of Nations constantly remaining before the entire San Francisco Conference, at least before those who were unwilling to repeat the mistakes of the League of Nations, the people who held this conference were not serious political leaders who learned from the experience of the League of Nations, but were some people who were completely naive and inexperienced in politics. In the eyes of the representative who spoke here about the past of Fascist Finland's attack on the Soviet Union, thus recalling the League of Nations, and making hostile slanders against the Soviet Union at the end of his speech, the experience of the League of Nations is clearly still an old dream that can be relived.

　　It is completely unfounded for some people to think that the San Francisco Conference made a mistake, and that the privileges granted to the Security Council by fifty countries actually hinder it from performing its sacred mission. Of course, it is possible to admit this, it is possible to admit anything, but how much basis and reason is there for this, and can this admission stand up to criticism – that is a completely different matter.

　　To all these questions, I answer that there is no reason for this, this attitude cannot withstand any criticism, and there is no basis for making this admission.

　　But what exactly is the problem? The problem is that the principle of great power unanimity has absolutely nothing to do with this, although it is actually the most important principle. But, by the way, I absolutely did not say, as Dulles said, that the principle of great power unanimity is the foundation of the entire United Nations. I did not say that. I said something else, and I will quote it verbatim once now. I said: "Undoubtedly, the foundation of the entire United Nations is an institution that, according to the Charter, only it has the right and privilege to fight against the threat of aggression, and to use means that other institutions are not authorized to use according to the Charter, and do not have the right to use according to the Charter." In that speech and on other occasions, I have repeatedly said that the principle of great power unanimity is one of the most important principles on which the United Nations is based. But when talking about the Security Council, I pointed out that the Security Council is the foundation of our organization. Some people have raised objections, and Mr. Dulles has come up with such an objection: he said that no, the foundation of the United Nations organization is the determination of the peoples. But, is the determination of the peoples to safeguard peace and security not also the foundation of the Security Council's activities, since the Security Council has the primary responsibility for safeguarding peace and security, and it should use its special rights and obligations, as well as the means at the disposal of its five permanent members, to achieve this lofty goal? Then what is the contradiction? There is no contradiction here. But the problem is not just the principle of great power unanimity. It is you who blame the veto power. This is your line, this is the reason you explain why things in the Security Council encounter obstacles, and why the Security Council has some malformations that must be eliminated. British representative Younger asked us why there are always nine or ten delegations opposing the use of the veto power. He said that it is because the rule of great power unanimity is not suitable for solving this kind of problem. But we want to say, no, it is not because of this. We start from a different position. Here, when talking about the veto power, I must once again quote Mr. Dulles' words. I am referring to his recently published book, "War or Peace?" This book is not without interest. (Dulles took out a book with a black and red cover and said, yes, here it is, this is the book.) Yes, this is the book. But in this book, as on its cover, there are many black colors.

　　Let's talk about Dulles' book. Mr. Dulles talks about the veto power on page 195 of the American edition of this book, saying: "Up to now, the majority of the Security Council has been friendly to the United States, so that it has not been necessary to use the veto power to protect our interests." Dulles confirms that those who control the majority do not need the veto power. The United States has already grasped this majority. So the United States does not need the veto power; it is needed by those who do not control the majority in the Security Council.

　　The sentence that this majority is friendly to the United States may be said to be correct, but friendship has various kinds of friendship, just as love has various kinds of love. There is even such a kind of love in the world that the lover is ready to suffocate the woman in his arms.

　　Therefore, according to Dulles' opinion, the United States does not need the veto power in the current situation. But what about tomorrow, Mr. Dulles? And what about the day after tomorrow? As long as you have the majority, as long as you think you are the master of this building called the Security Council, you will curse this "veto power," but secretly you will keep it until the time comes when you think it is necessary to use it. You foresee this situation, because you openly talked about it in this book, the time when it is necessary to use the veto power. Mr. Dulles wrote: "But things may not always be like this, and if they are not, the United States will certainly demand the veto power."

　　Dulles continued to write: "We already know that the United States insisted on placing the Japanese mandated islands under 'strategic' trusteeship, so that we can use the veto power in the Security Council to prevent any handling of these islands that we believe is detrimental to American security. For example, can we agree to put ourselves in a position where the majority vote of the Security Council can ask us to hand over these islands to Russia, or to hand over the Panama Canal for the sake of peace?" Dulles asked American readers in this book: Are you willing for the United States to give up the Panama Canal for the sake of peace? It seems that one can no longer express himself more clearly than this.

　　Some countries believe that because of the veto power, the hope of maintaining international peace and security – which is the responsibility of the five powers – has been completely destroyed. Is the intention of this statement not clear now?

　　Representatives of small countries, I beg your forgiveness, but the US Secretary of State said correctly to the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July 1945: Only these five major powers can make united efforts to strive for peace, or separately prepare for war, using every possible means.

　　Finally, it must be understood that without the unanimity of the five powers, peace is often unstable. Therefore, the problem is not that the principle of unanimity is bad, but rather how the policies of these five major powers are, and whether these policies guarantee the possibility of the five powers acting in concert.

　　We can cite dozens or hundreds of facts to prove that the reason for these situations in the Security Council and the United Nations is that a policy has been adopted with the help of Dulles and other American leaders after Roosevelt who are similar to Dulles. This policy forms the basis of American foreign policy – this so-called "new" policy is a policy of taking a tough attitude towards the allies who fought alongside it during the war, a policy of non-cooperation and issuing orders.

　　The American ruling clique openly said: It is necessary to use force to treat the Soviet Union more severely, and only when the United States has forces as strong as the Soviet Union, and when the Soviet Union trembles, can some kind of agreement be reached with the Soviet Union. But what a arrogant and vulgar fantasy this is, because the Soviet Union will never tremble! People who look through Russian history and Soviet history will believe this. Therefore, the reason for the various political disputes in the United Nations is not that the General Assembly has too little power, nor is it that the Security Council has abused its powers. No, the reason is not here. The reason for the current abnormal situation lies in America's "tough line," in a policy that uses pressure, unreasonably makes all kinds of demands, and is backed by endless military facilities and war measures, and by a series of various bases – air force bases, naval bases, army bases, this kind of base and that kind of base. Let us take a look at the world maps published in some American magazines, on which we can see the base network of the United States, and the attacking arrows extending from the bases are like tongues of fire pointing to a center, destroying that place is not just the long-term dream of the gentlemen of Bolivia.

　　We are in favor of taking any measures to safeguard peace and the security of all countries. We also support the seven-nation proposal – the ideals of this proposal and some of its provisions, as long as it aims at consolidating peace. But we do not support your starting point, because it is false; we do not support your motives, because they are treacherous; we do not support proposals like yours to establish armed forces for the United Nations organization, because the goal of these forces is precisely the opposite of what you proclaim in the name of your proposal. This will eventually be known.

　　Mr. Younger – I would also like to spend some time talking about him – he also starts from this hypocritical attitude.

　　First, let's talk about the so-called paralysis of the Security Council. Britain's current actions are cunning, just like Mr. Dulles' State Department – please forgive me, the State Department may not be Mr. Dulles', but rather Acheson's, or Dulles and Acheson's, I don't know, maybe it's both of them. – keep silent on the issue of abolishing the "veto power," thinking that the "veto power" may also be beneficial to oneself one day. But in the current situation, the Security Council is an obstacle to implementing expansion plans, saying that it is paralyzed and does not work, so it is necessary to circumvent the Security Council that has the veto power. Isn't the United States implementing an expansionist policy of aggression against the People's Republic of China? Isn't the crossing of the 38th parallel in Korea by troops that are actually from the US-British bloc but are forcibly called United Nations troops expansion and aggression?

　　British representative Younger, in his speech on October 12, attempted to prove that not only the Security Council is responsible for peace and the security of all countries, but also the United Nations General Assembly. For this purpose, he cited the corresponding Articles 10, 11, 12, and 14 of the Charter. But is this the subject of the dispute, Mr. Younger? Is there anyone arguing that the United Nations General Assembly should not have the right or power to consider the issues stipulated in the Charter – such as safeguarding international peace and the security of all countries, strengthening peace and safeguarding the security of all countries – or even to make suggestions on these issues? In essence, this is why it is said that you, Mr. Younger, are wasting your verbal ammunition. You are shooting in the wrong direction, because the question is not at all whether the United Nations organization has these rights, but rather the size and nature of these rights, the size of these powers. In other words, what is the extent of these powers granted to the General Assembly as the main organ of the United Nations organization? What is the extent of these powers of the Security Council – also a main organ of the United Nations organization? These are two main organs, and the Charter must divide the functions and powers between them. In my opinion, the Charter has divided their functions and powers, and Articles 11 and 12 clearly explain the boundary of this division.

　　Mr. Younger also mentioned Article 51 of the Charter. Regarding this, I would also like to mention Article 52, which concerns regional arrangements. But both of these articles are relevant to our dispute. You just didn't notice this, Mr. Younger, these articles once again affirm that even when regional arrangements exist, the Security Council has its special tasks in the implementation or realization of these regional arrangements and the events that occur.

　　Younger further attempted to prove that the "seven-nation" proposal did not give the General Assembly any special powers that belong to the Security Council. He pointed out that this proposal only mentions the rights, powers, and responsibilities that currently belong to the General Assembly under the Charter. If this is the case, then why is it necessary to put forward this proposal that does not repeat what is said in the Charter, but rather changes the Charter and talks about the new rights of the General Assembly?

　　If Mr. Younger is right, then it is necessary to answer this question – does the Charter give the General Assembly the right to establish armed forces? Please point out where the Charter says this.

　　Does the Charter give the General Assembly the right to control and command the armed forces – military forces – of the United Nations organization? Please point out where the Charter mentions this.

　　Does the Charter give the Secretary-General the right to set up military advisers and command these military advisers?

　　Does the Charter mention these kinds of things anywhere? Please show me.

　　On the contrary, doesn't the Charter state that the Secretary-General must handle the affairs of the Secretariat?

　　But since when did military actions and military affairs become the affairs of the Secretariat? Why, in this case, is the position of Secretary-General filled by the current Secretary-General, who is a purely civilian person who is not completely suitable for his position? Please show me where it is written in the Charter that the Secretary-General is vested with military powers – to command military advisers?

　　Isn't all this enough to show that the initiators of the "seven-nation" proposal do want to grant the United Nations General Assembly rights that it does not have and are very important? They want to do this because they do not demand respect for the Charter. And you, these great gentlemen, do not respect the Charter because your policies require you to do so. Where does the current situation of the Security Council, its inaction, its paralysis, etc., come from?

　　This "inaction" of the Security Council that you are talking about is nothing but the result of the policies that you are implementing, the result of your policies.

　　Mr. Younger said: The existing international regulations are not applicable to the modern world. It seems that international law is also bad, not only is the Security Council bad, but international law is also bad. New regulations must be formulated to replace the old international regulations. Younger even said: The principles of security and order must be used to replace the rules of the barbaric countries. That is to say, if this sentence is applied to our debate, it would be concluded that the United Nations organization seems to be a kind of barbaric country, and its Charter seems to be the rules of the barbaric countries.

　　Now, in order to replace the barbaric laws of this barbaric people, the seven proposing countries suggest formulating some new regulations that look very beautiful on the paper of this "seven-nation" proposal.

　　I think all these are completely unserious, just as unserious as Mr. Younger's most recent argument. I think it is necessary to briefly talk about this argument of his. When talking about the issue of consultation in accordance with Article 106 of the Charter, Younger said that the Soviet Union should take a more constructive position than it has taken before. Not like – in Mr. Younger's words – the position taken when consulting on the issues of Berlin and Austria. Here, Younger's words must be corrected.

　　The first correction: these issues have never been consulted on in the Security Council or other United Nations organs. These consultations were conducted in the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers.

　　The second correction: The consultations on the issues of Germany and Austria in the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference in 1949 produced very important results, which are reflected in the unanimously agreed communiqué, Mr. Younger, reflected in a very important communiqué. But the things agreed at that time were not implemented. As everyone knows, this was not due to the fault of the Soviet Union, but due to the fault of the British and American camp.

　　What Younger said here is actually equivalent to saying: The Soviet Union, which proposes consultations, must be an obedient partner, and those who consult with it can issue orders as they please. In the words of Younger and Dulles, this is called constructive behavior....

　　The British representative clearly does not like our suggestions. And the suggestions we have put forward fully require genuine consultation and mutual concessions, and concessions cannot be unilateral. How does Mr. Younger think about this issue? Obviously, he did not think about abandoning his previous attitude, but rather preferred to put forward his earlier demands. In any case, he clearly did not hope to abide by the British maxim here, that is, practical evidence is better than empty talk. Why not try it, maybe something will happen. In this regard, I want to answer Dulles by the way. He spoke here about the Military Staff Committee and said that we do not participate, so strange things have occurred. On the one hand, we say: "Restore the activities of the Military Staff Committee," but on the other hand, we missed all the meetings of the committee. However, first of all, Dulles understands very well why this has happened, so if they really want to eliminate this abnormal phenomenon, then they must seriously consider how to eliminate the real reason for this phenomenon; secondly, I must state that for a long time, there was not even one item on the agenda of the Military Staff Committee meeting. Our representatives have pointed out in essence that this Military Staff Committee is completely useless, because there is not even one item on its agenda.

　　Why is there not even one item? Because there are some disagreements. Therefore, we say that the five major powers must be urged to take measures and seek ways to implement Article 106 of the Charter, so that the Military Staff Committee can work effectively.

　　Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson has a very detailed speech here. He also talked about the Interim Committee. He admitted that the Interim Committee did fail. However, he said that the reason why the committee failed to act was because the Security Council was already acting, so he explained this failure. However, when the Interim Committee was established, we heard that the Interim Committee had to be established because the Security Council was not acting. And when the Interim Committee was established, the result was that it could not act because the Security Council was already acting. They have warned, and are now warning, our colleagues not to play with this kind of trickery. If this is indeed the case, what is the benefit of this? Especially because they relate to our Charter. The main thing that Mr. Pearson attempted to prove is the same thing again, that is: to say that when the Security Council cannot act, it is necessary to enable the United Nations organization to act. But we must study the essence, we should find out why this abnormal situation occurs when the Security Council does not act, as you call it. Is there any reason other than the organizational form and principles of the Security Council's work? Is the problem that the rights that cannot be granted to the General Assembly without sacrificing the Charter are being granted to the General Assembly, or is it necessary to change the political direction of certain countries in solving certain problems, that is, to change the foreign policy of these countries? The United States changed its policy a few years ago. It went from the policy of wartime cooperation to the policy of "tough line" after the war. There is no better example of one policy direction contradicting another policy direction.

　　Now think carefully: what would happen if you went back to the old policy of cooperation from this new so-called "tough line" (this line obviously has not produced any results and cannot produce any results). Under the old policy, there was the same veto power and the same Security Council, and there was cooperation at that time. Try going back to this line, maybe there will be some changes. Give up the practice of issuing orders to sovereign countries that have equal rights with you.

　　Some people say: No one is trying to weaken the United Nations organization. It is said that on the contrary, the "seven-nation" proposal will strengthen this organization. But how to strengthen it? The only way is this fact, that is, the purpose of the proposal is to violate the Charter, which can be seen from analyzing sections "C" and "D" of this proposal.

　　Some people say that the "seven-nation" proposal is still in order to strengthen the United Nations organization. In order to confirm this, they even mentioned the establishment of the North Atlantic Alliance, obviously wanting to prove that this kind of "regional" measure is also a so-called strengthening of the United Nations organization. But everyone knows that the purpose of the North Atlantic Alliance is not to strengthen the United Nations organization, but on the contrary, to weaken it. It is irrelevant to bring up Articles 51 and 52 of the Charter here, because when talking about the North Atlantic Alliance, there would not have been, and will not be now, any question of self-defense.

　　In fact, who is this alliance intending to "defend"? Why does the North Atlantic Alliance deny the possibility of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries participating? On the other hand, why does this so-called regional alliance not include a specific region, but rather a "region" with an extremely broad meaning of the word? It is especially broad if Turkey, which is striving to participate in the convention, is included.

　　The entire history of the creation of the North Atlantic Alliance and all the activities of the alliance confirm that this alliance is not a tool for defending countries that no one is attacking and no one intends to attack, but rather a tool of the policies of the ruling groups of the United States and Britain on both sides of the Atlantic, that is, in the two hemispheres.

　　Some people have tried to prove that the purpose of the North Atlantic Alliance is to strengthen the United Nations organization, and that the establishment of this alliance is completely in line with the purpose and tasks of the United Nations organization. However, as the saying goes: things will always come to light. It is impossible to conceal the fact that the establishment of the North Atlantic Alliance was not for defense at all, as its founders have repeatedly said. For example, we only need to recall Churchill's speech at the Fulton Conference hosted by US President Truman, and there will be no doubt about what the word "defense" means. As long as we recall the remarks of many authoritative representatives of the United States, such as MacArthur, former Defense Secretary Johnson, and Navy Secretary Matthews, about the regions through which this "defense" line passes, we can know that the issue in dispute is not a question of defense at all, but rather the creation of appropriate conditions for implementing the American expansionist policy.

　　It is said that the "seven-nation" proposal will be able to create a substitute for the Security Council.

　　But even if this view is adopted, it seems that the reason why this so-called substitute is a substitute is only because the rights that have not made it a substitute until now are granted to the United Nations General Assembly in this way. That is to say: the United Nations General Assembly is granted new rights and new powers that this so-called substitute has not been vested with until now. In other words, it is being granted new powers and new rights, which at the same time seriously violate the Charter and violate the established procedures that should be followed when proposing amendments and changes to the Charter.

　　Here, I must continue to talk about the speech of Philippine representative Romulo, who talked about this topic more clearly than others, that is to say: giving new rights to the General Assembly.

　　I must ignore many of his comparisons and arguments that are intended to show that the Security Council is "insignificant," which can never be agreed to. I want to talk about some of the most important issues, especially the section of the seven-nation proposal that stipulates the establishment of a committee to investigate the resources necessary for organizing collective self-defense. Romulo forgot that the issue in dispute is not who should collect information about resources and armed forces, but rather who should use this information and who should apply this information. The problem is to establish a specialized agency, which must formulate operational plans based on information about the resources, means, and armed forces possessed by certain countries when it is necessary to use military methods to resist aggressors in order to defend peace. Naturally, establishing such a specialized committee and vesting it with such functions, vesting it with the power to compile documents, make conclusions, and prepare necessary and feasible measures – all of this is of course a clear violation of the Charter. Establishing such a committee will only reduce the power of the United Nations General Assembly, because, in this way, it will be a committee composed of a minority of United Nations member states that will formulate the collective actions to resist aggression, rather than the United Nations General Assembly itself, which is attended by representatives of all United Nations member states. Romulo does not want to agree with this view, because he does not understand the essence of the dispute. The essence of the dispute actually exists

    维辛斯基关于“保障和平的联合行动”案演说全文
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约十六日电：苏联代表团团长维辛斯基十月十三日在联合国大会政治委员会上就“保障和平的联合行动”案发表演说，全文如下：
    在这结束过去几天辩论的时候，轮到我来发言。这个辩论的题目是每一个真正相信联合国的任务是制止新战争的威胁及巩固和平和保卫各国安全的人所非常关怀的。
    到现在为止，对七国代表团的提案——“保障和平的联合行动”案——已经发表了很多的演说，在讨论这个问题时，参加的极为踊跃——对这一点我们唯有表示欢迎，如果从这种情形来看，那末这个问题为每一个人所关心，就自然可以看得清清楚楚了。我这样说并不是专指“七国”提案，我是指的这个问题本身，这个构成会上关于“七国”提案的全部辩论内容的题目本身；我所指的是各国代表团在这个问题上所申述的各种见解。
    在这个重要的讨论过程中，对于苏联代表团在会上提出的意见，对于苏联代表团现在和过去都认为为了对加强和平与国际安全的伟大事业能有所贡献而必需维护的建议，曾给予充分的注意，我想我如果特别强调指出这一点，是不算过分的。
    在这方面，我不得不首先提到一些演说，这些演说我们不能不认为与一般的态度不相协调到了粗暴的地步，而在我看来，正是这种一般的态度才使我们能共同在这里讨论这个问题。我所以说粗暴，因为它不仅在形式上粗暴而不能容许，在本质上也是极不公平的。因为这些演说是拿事实开玩笑，是曲解历史事实，是捏造历史。我现在所想到的一篇演说，如果不是为了下列两种情况，简直就可以完全不理会，完全不予以任何注意：一种情况是，有人认为必需把一种并不能证明为有爱好和平的倾向的动机放进这个严肃的和重要的问题中去，而正是为了讨论这个问题，我们才在这里开会，也正是为了这个问题，联合国组织才有它存在的必要。
    第二种情况是，他们这样做的时候，甚至于不惜粗暴地曲解事实。
    我现在所指的是玻利维亚代表的演说；对于这个演说，我必须作个答复。
    我在第一次演说时曾指出：苏联正不屈不挠地执行着和平的外交政策，并在它的一切行动——伟大的行动——中以及苏联吁请联合国支持的一切问题上，为这个政策的胜利实现而奋斗。我曾提到斯大林大元帅在一九三六年所发表的声明，我当时并引用了他的话。
    你们大家必定记得玻利维亚代表在这问题上所发表的意见是怎样不可容许地无耻和粗暴。我轻蔑地而义愤地把这种粗暴行为置之不理。但是玻利维亚代表说：那是在一九三六年，而现在呢，他说时代改变了，调子也不同了。
    对于他的这些话，已经作了一部分回答。我几乎可以说，即使在我们会上常常发生的尖锐争辩的情况下，他的这些话也是从来不曾有过的，甚至在我们联合国组织的历史上也几乎是没有先例的。不过，如果需要比一九三六年更新一些的事实的话，我是能够追述这些事实的。
    我可以追述一些比较新近的事实，它会告诉我们玻利维亚那位先生这种叫嚣的真义何在。首先，我要追述一九三八年的事实，当时苏联政府向各大国建议立即在国际联盟内外举行会商，讨论苏联政府当时认为必须采取的实际措施，以制止希特勒侵略的进一步发展，清除因希特勒的侵略而增加的新战争危机。
    这样看来，苏联政府在一九三八年就主动提出了这个非常重要的问题；建议采取防止希特勒侵略的措施，大家都记得很清楚——这本来是不需要我来提醒大家的——希特勒侵略终于引起了第二次世界大战。然而苏联政府的和平步骤的结果是什么呢？
    举个例来说，英国政府答复苏联政府这个建议的照会，表明英国政府并不认为这个建议是值得欢迎的，或者更准确地说，它认为去阻止希特勒侵略计划的实施，是不值得欢迎的。
    我只要指出下面这一件事情就够了：英国答复我国所提紧急召开四强会议以采取必要措施的建议说，英王政府认为举行会议商讨以“协议一致的行动”制止侵略一事，并不一定对欧洲和平的前途有好处。
    先生们，结果产生了慕尼黑，关于这一点我只说这一个字，不去更详细地说它了。
    我现在谈到这一点是为了要说明：在任何问题的任何讨论中某些攻击苏联政府的外交政策的先生们，绝不能拿他们的愚昧无知来作为理由，更不能拿来作为捏造事实的理由。这一点，不学无术之徒可能甚至还不懂得。但是这正是不学无术之徒命该如此！
    我们还可以举出一个事实：一九三九年，苏联政府曾再度建议召开英、法、罗马尼亚、波兰、土耳其和苏联六国代表的会议，以拟订对付希特勒匪帮侵略罗马尼亚的措施。我要强调指出：英、法、罗、波、土、苏六国会议的目的是采取对付希特勒匪帮侵略罗马尼亚的措施，这个侵略当时正在准备之中，英国政府手中有关于这个事实的精确材料。
    英国驻莫斯科大使席兹在苏联政府就这个问题与英国政府进行交涉的时候，避不答复英国在希特勒匪帮一旦进攻罗马尼亚时将采取什么态度。席兹先生十分含糊其词地答道：“罗马尼亚距离苏联比英国近”，因此他就袖手旁观，置身事外了。现在的事实是朝鲜和中国距离英国很远，如果英国代表说一声“准用”前例，这才是合乎逻辑的。
    但他们现在对此却缄默不言了。
    一九三九年的情况就是如此。这便是事实，便是若干一意孤行的代表试图加以歪曲的历史事实。
    最后，我也来追述若干其他事实。不，这不是我追述——杜勒斯先生已经追述过了。他刚才就追述说，一九四五年在旧金山时，苏联政府曾长时间反对关于联合国宪章第十条的措词的建议，后来却答应了，并接受会议大多数所建议的措词，这是真的。真有这件事。但必须再进一步说明。这一事实之所以发生，是由于谈判的结果，特别是那时华盛顿和莫斯科之间，即斯退丁纽斯（那时的美国国务卿）和苏联外长莫洛托夫之间的谈判，这个谈判为实际上作这个让步提供了充分的理由。但是，难道一九四五年的这一事实不是说明苏联愿意合作，甚至不惜撤消会有碍于这种合作的若干要求吗？一九四五年的这一事实就是极好的证据，说明苏联是一贯地寻求合作的办法，愿意对它的伙伴让步，当然这是在某种限度以内，当然不是无限制的，当然不是在这种情况之下，即是说不是在别人以或明或暗的压力施之于苏联的意志而强使苏联接受他们自己的要求的情况之下去让步。他们忘记了苏联不是这种实验的合适对象，忘记了“应该选择离开苏维埃之宫更远一点的角落去进行这种勾当”。
    我认为，事实足以使玻利维亚代表诽谤者哑口无言。玻利维亚代表企图在这里诬蔑苏联的和平政策，费尽心机地在有关苏联利益的一些事件上发明各种各样的捏造虚构，而且不仅在有关苏联利益的事件上——罗马尼亚事件就是一个例子——同时也是在有关其他曾经奋力反对希特勒侵略的国家的利益的事件上作种种捏造。玻利维亚代表掩盖了当时的情况，即罗马尼亚政府的变更是发生在苏军正向柏林开展攻势的时候，发生在前将军拉德士古与前国王米海伊还正在力图瓦解苏联后方，就是苏军后方以阻碍这个攻势的时候发生的。
    现在，我要转到我们正在此地讨论的问题的本质了。自然，我无法涉及这里所提到的每一件事。我要选择某些主要的议题。我愿意就主要的反对者，即这项“七国”提案的主要起草人来谈谈。我想首先把我的注意力集中在这个提案上。
    第一，如果有谁认为对这项提案的某一段的修正案的这一节或那一节提出反对，那么就可以证明对这个提案所提出的主张持不忠诚的态度，这种想法会是很奇怪的。有人说，“当维辛斯基突然开始批评我们的提案时，我们大感失望了。”他们不喜欢我们的批评。然而，我们却要批评那些需要批评的，而接受那些我们认为可以接受的。这完全是自然而合法的。
    所以，只因为有人对于被认为重要的若干段落表示了原起草人所没有明白表示的意见，并有其他的提案提出，就穿凿附会地去追究他没有说出来的思想，那就出奇了。
    在讨论“七国”提案中有些代表在表示自己的立场时再三提到苏联代表团对这个问题所表示的见解。
    我想：也需要谈一谈那些旨在反驳我们的议论和见解的发言。我必须说：虽然我们与“七国”提案的起草人都一致有着同一的目标——保证那种足以保证巩固和平及各国安全的措施——但我们是在原则上与他们不同的。
    我们是从那一点出发呢？“七国”提案的起草人提出这项提案时是从那一点出发呢？我想，我前次已经把这一点说得很清楚。如果需要我用几分钟谈谈这一点，就请允许我这样作。
    苏联代表团及支持我们的主张的各国代表团认为：“七国”提案的起草人，是由虚妄的前提——我着重地说，虚妄的前提——出发的，这种虚妄的前提就是：安理会可能陷入一种不能行使其职权的境地，而且这种情况已然发生并且不可免地要发生，只是因为安理会受到了某种特权的考验，这种特权的运用，据说是阻碍了安理会职权的行使。
    按照我们的反对者，也就是“七国”提案的支持者，所提出的反对意见的逻辑，就会不得不承认在旧金山会议上赋予安理会的权利和特权本身就阻碍它执行它的职能。如果承认这一点，就会相信：尽管国际联盟的令人悲痛的记忆始终不移地摆在整个旧金山会议面前至少是摆在不愿重蹈国联覆辙的人们的面前，但是举行这个会议的人却不是从国联的经验中取得教训的严肃的政治领袖，而是一些在政治上完全天真与没有经验的人们。在那一位在这里谈到法西斯芬兰进攻苏联的往事，因而回想起国际联盟，并在其发言结束时对苏联进行敌意诽谤的代表看来，国际联盟的经验显然还是一个可以重温的旧梦。
    一些人认为旧金山会议犯了错误，认为五十个国家赋与安全理事会的特权实际上妨碍了它执行其神圣任务，这种说法是完全没有根据的。当然，承认这一点是可能的，承认任何事情都是可能的，但是到底这事有多少根据，有多少理由，这种承认是否经得起批评——那就完全是另一回事了。
    对于这一切问题，我回答说：这是没有理由的，这种态度经不起任何批评，没有任何根据能作这种承认。
    但是，问题到底怎样呢？问题是大国一致的原则和这事完全没有关系，虽然它在实际上是最重要的原则。不过，顺便说一句，我绝对没有像杜勒斯所说的那样说过大国一致的原则是整个联合国的基础。我没有那样说过。我说过一些别的事情，我现在就来逐字地引用一次，我是那样说的：“无疑地，整个联合国的基础是那样的一个机构，根据宪章，只有它才有与侵略的威胁进行斗争的权利和特权，并使用别的机构根据宪章并未获准而且根据宪章也没有权利使用的手段。”在那次发言和其他场合，我屡次地说到，大国一致的原则是联合国赖以为基础的最重要原则之一。但在说到安全理事会的时候，我指出安全理事会是我们这个组织的基础。有些人却提出了异议，而且杜勒斯先生想出来这样一个异议：他说，不然，联合国组织的基础是各族人民的决心。但是，安全理事会在保卫和平与安全的问题上负有主要的责任，它应利用它的特殊权利和义务以及它的五个常任理事所能支配的手段来达成这种崇高的目的；难道各族人民要保障和平和安全的决心，不也是安全理事会活动的基础吗？那末又有什么矛盾呢？这里并没有任何矛盾。但是问题不仅仅是大国一致的原则。责备否决权的是你们。这就是你们的路线，就是你们解释为什么安全理事会的事情遇到障碍，为什么安全理事会有若干必须消除的畸形现象的理由。英国代表杨格问我们，为什么总有九个、十个代表团反对使用否决权呢？他说，因为大国一致的规则不适于解决这一类的问题。我们却要说，不，并不是因为这个。我们是从不同的立场出发。这里，谈到否决权，我就不得不再次援引杜勒斯先生的话。我是指的他最近出版的书“战争乎，和平乎，”。这本书并非没有趣味的。（杜勒斯拿出一本印着黑红两色封面的书说，是的，这里就是，这就是这本书。）是的，就是这本书。但是在这本书里面，正如在它的封面上一样，有很多的黑颜色。
    让我们谈谈杜勒斯的书吧。杜勒斯先生在他这本书的美国版第一百九十五面上谈到否决权说：“到现在为止，安全理事会的多数对美国表示友好，以致并不需要用否决权来保障我们的利益。”杜勒斯证实，那些控制多数的人是不需要否决权的。美国手里已掌握了这种多数。所以美国不需要否决权；需要它的是那些在安全理事会中并没有控制多数的人。
    这个多数对美国是友好的，这句话也许可以说是正确的，但是友谊有各种各样的友谊正如爱情有各种各样的爱情一样。世界上甚至于还有这样一种爱情，就是情郎已准备好，要把他怀抱里的女郎闷死呢。
    因此，按照杜勒斯的意见，在目前情况下，美国不需要否决权。但明天怎样呢，杜勒斯先生？而且后天又怎样呢？只要你掌有多数，只要你认为你是这个叫做安理会的大厦的主人，你就会咒骂这个“否决权”，但暗中你却把它保留起来，直到你认为有必要使用它的时机到来之时。你预见到了这种情况，因为你在这本书中公开谈到了，有必要使用否决权的时机。杜勒斯先生写道：“但是事情可能并非经常都是这样的，如遇不是这样的时候，美国当然便要求有否决权”。
    杜勒斯继续写道：“我们已经知道，美国坚持把日本的委任统治岛屿置于‘战略’托管之下，这样，我们就能够在安理会通过否决权来制止对这些岛屿作任何我们认为有碍美国安全的处理。举例说，我们能够同意使自己处于这种地位吗，即安理会的多数票可以要求我们把这些岛屿交由俄国治理，或者为和平利益计而交出巴拿马运河？”杜勒斯在这本书中向美国读者发问道：你愿意美国为和平利益计而放弃巴拿马运河吗？看来，一个人再不能比这表现得更明白了。
    这里有人告诉我们说：“不过，和平是崇高的目标，和平要求放弃各种利益，要求决心作任何牺牲”。但是美国会放弃巴拿马运河的利益吗？不，它不会放弃的。杜勒斯先生说：“我深信美国不会同意使自己处于那种境地的”。
    有的国家认为由于有了否决权，维持国际和平与安全——这是五强的职责——的希望就统统被摧毁了。这种说法的用意何在现在难道还不明白吗？
    小国的代表们，我求你们原谅，一九四五年七月美国国务卿在美国参院外交委员会上说得不错，他说：用尽一切办法以联合起来努力争取和平，或者分别从事准备战争的只有这五个主要的强国。
    最后必须了解：没有五强的一致，和平常常是不稳固的。所以，问题不在于一致的原则不好，而在于这五个大国的政策如何，以及这种政策是否保证了五强一致行动的可能性。
    我们可以引证几十件几百件事实证明：在安理会和联合国内发生这些情况的原因是：在杜勒斯以及罗斯福以后和杜勒斯相类的其他的美国领袖帮助下通过了一种方针，这种方针形成美国外交政策的基础——这种所谓“新的”方针是一种对于在战时与它并肩作战的战友们采取强硬态度的方针，是一种不合作而且发号施令的方针。
    美国统治集团公开地说：必须使用强力更为严厉地对待苏联，等到美国有了与苏联同样强大的武力，等到苏联发抖的时候，才能与苏联获致某种协议。但是这是多么狂妄粗俗的幻想啊，因为苏联决不会有发抖的一天！人们如果去翻一翻俄国历史和苏联历史就会相信这一点。因此，联合国中种种政治纠纷的原因，并不是大会权力太小，也不是安理会滥用了职权。不是的，原因不在这里。造成目前不正常的情势的原因，在于美国的“强硬路线”，在于一种政策，使用压力，不讲道理地提出各种各样的要求，而以无穷无尽的各种各样的军事设施和战争措施为后盾，以一系列的各种基地——空军基地、海军基地、陆军基地、这种基地那种基地——为后盾。我们且看一看美国某些杂志所刊载的世界地图吧，那上面可以看出美国这个基地网，基地上伸出来的进攻的箭头象火舌一样地指向一个中心，摧毁那个地方并不仅仅是玻利维亚诸公的长期好梦。
    我们赞成采取任何保障和平与各国安全的措施。我们也支持七国提案——这项提案的理想和其中若干规定，只要它以巩固和平为目的。但我们不支持你们的出发点，因为那是虚伪的；我们不支持你的动机，因为那是奸诈的；我们不支持你所提的建立联合国组织武装部队这类的提案，因为这种部队的目标恰恰和你们在你们的提案的名称中所宣扬的相反。这一点终会被人知道的。
    杨格先生——我也愿用一些时间谈一谈他——他也是从这种虚伪的态度出发的。
    首先谈谈所谓安理会陷于瘫痪。英国目前的行动是狡猾的，就象杜勒斯先生的国务院一样——请原谅，国务院也许不是杜勒斯先生的，而是艾奇逊的，或是杜勒斯和艾奇逊两人的，我不知道，也许是两个人的吧。——在废除“否决权”的问题上保持缄默，心想“否决权”或许也有一天会对自己有利。但在目前的情况下安理会是实行扩张计划的一个障碍，说它瘫痪不灵，因此必需规避有否决权的安理会。美国对中华人民共和国难道不是在实行着扩张主义的侵略政策吗？实际上是美英集团的军队而被硬叫做联合国的军队之越过朝鲜三八线，难道不是扩张，不是侵略吗？
    英国代表杨格在他十月十二日的演说里企图证明：对和平与各国的安全负责的不仅有安理会，并且也有联合国大会。为了这个目的，他并引出宪章中相应的第十、第十一、第十二、第十四条。但是，这就是争端的主题吗，杨格先生？是不是有人争论联合国大会不应有考虑宪章中规定的问题——如保卫国际和平与各国安全、加强和平与保卫各国安全等问题——或甚至就这些问题提出建议的权利或权力呢？从本质上说来，这就是为什么说你杨格先生是在浪费舌战弹药的原故。你是在向着一个错误的方向开枪，因为问题完全不是联合国组织有没有这些权利，问题是这些权利的大小与性质，这些权力的大小。换一种说法来说，就是作为联合国组织的主要机关的大会所赋有的这些权力的限度如何？安理会——也是联合国组织的一个主要机关——的这些权力的限度又如何？这是两个主要机关，宪章必须划分它们之间的职能与权力。依我看来，宪章是划分了它们的职能和权力的，第十一条和第十二条就清楚地说明了这个划分的界线。
    杨格先生还提到宪章第五十一条。关于这一点，我还要提出论及区域办法的第五十二条。但这两条对于我们的争论都是有关系的。这一点你恰巧没有注意到，杨格先生，这些条款再一次申明：即使在有区域办法存在的时候，在实施或实现这些区域办法而发生事件的时候，安理会也有其特别任务。
    杨格进一步企图证明，“七国”提案没有给大会以任何属于安理会的特别职权。他指出，这个提案只提及大会的权利、权力，以及目前根据宪章属于大会的职责。若果如此，那么，为什么必须提出这种不是重复宪章中所说过的，而是改变宪章，谈到大会新权利的提案呢？
    如果杨格先生是对的，那末就有必要回答这个问题——难道宪章给大会以设置武装部队的权利吗？请指出来宪章那里说到了这一点吧。
    难道宪章给了大会以支配并指挥联合国组织的武装部队——军事队伍的权利吗？请指出来宪章那里提到了这一点吧。
    难道宪章给了秘书长以设置军事顾问并指挥这些军事顾问的权利吗？
    难道宪章在任何地方提到这类事情吗？请指给我看看吧。
    相反地，难道宪章没有声明，秘书长必须处理秘书处的问题吗？
    但是，从什么时候起，军事行动和军事事务变成了秘书处的事情呢？为什么在这种情形下，秘书长的职位是由现任秘书长这样一个纯属文人，不完全适合于他的职位的人来充任呢？请指给我看，宪章中那里写着，秘书长赋有军事职权——指挥军事顾问呢？
    难道这一切不足以说明“七国”提案的发起人确要赋予联合国大会以它所没有的而且非常重要的权利吗？他们所以要这样做是因为他们并不要求尊重宪章。而你们这些大人先生们不要尊重宪章是因为你们的政策需要你们这样做。安理会目前的那种情况，它的无所作为，它的瘫痪状态等等是从那里来的呢！
    你们所谈的安理会的这种“无所作为”不是别的，而是你们所实行的政策的结果，是你们的政策的结果。
    杨格先生说：现存的国际法规是不适用于现代世界的。看来好象国际法也不好了，不但安理会不好，而且国际法也不好了。必须制订新的法规，以代替旧的国际法规了。杨格甚至说：必须以安全与秩序的原则来代替蛮荒之邦的规则，这就是说，如果把这句话应用到我们的辩论里来，就会得出结论：联合国组织似乎是蛮荒之邦一类的东西，其宪章似乎是蛮荒之邦的规则了。
    现在为了代替这个野蛮人民的野蛮法律，七个提案国建议制定若干在这个“七国”提案纸面上看起来很漂亮的新法规。
    我认为所有这些都是完全不严肃的，就象杨格先生最近一次的议论一样不严肃，我认为有必要简短地谈谈他的这个议论。杨格在谈论按照宪章第一百零六条进行协商的问题时说，苏联应采取比前此所采取的较有建设性的立场。不是象——用杨格先生的话说——在协商柏林和奥地利问题时那样的立场。这里必须对杨格的话加以更正。
    第一个更正：这些问题在安理会和其他联合国机构中都未曾有过任何协商。这些协商是在四国外长会议中进行的。
    第二个更正：一九四九年巴黎四外长会议中对德国和奥地利问题的协商产生了十分重要的结果，这种结果反映在大家一致同意的公报中，杨格先生，反映在一个非常重要的公报中。但那时所获致协议的事情都未实施。众所周知，这不是由于苏联的过失，而是由于英美阵营的过失。
    关于这一点杨格在这里所说的话，实际上就等于说：提出协商建议的苏联，必须是一个唯命是从的伙伴，它与之协商的那些人只要随心所欲发号施令就行了。用杨格和杜勒斯的话来说，这就叫做建设性的行为……。
    英国代表显然并不喜欢我们的建议。而我们提出的建议充分要求真正的协商和互相让步，让步不能是单方面的。杨格先生对这问题作如何想？显然他并没有想到放弃以前的态度，而宁愿提出早先的要求，在任何情况下他显然并不希望在这里遵守英国的格言，即是空论不如实证。不妨试一下，或许会有什么结果吧。在这一方面我要顺便答复杜勒斯。他在这里发言说到军事参谋团时说，我们并不参加，因此奇怪的事便产生了。我们一方面说：“恢复军事参谋团的活动”，然而另一方面我们却错过了该团的所有的会议。然而，首先杜勒斯很明白为什么会有这种结果，因此如果他们真正希望消除这种不正常现象，那末就必需严肃地考虑一下如何消除这种现象的真正原因；其次，我必须声明，在很长一段时期，军事参谋团会议的议程上就连一项议题也没有。我国的代表们曾经就实质而言，指出这个军事参谋团是完全没有用处的，因为在它的议程上连一项议题也没有。
    为什么一项议题都没有呢？因为有某些意见不一致。因此我们说，必须敦促五大强国采取措施，寻求方法使宪章第一百零六条得以实现，使军事参谋团得以有效地进行工作。
    加拿大外交部长皮尔逊在这里有非常详尽的发言。他并且说到临时委员会。他承认临时委员会的确遭到失败。不过他说，委员会之所以未能行动是因为安理会已在行动，如此来解释这种失败。可是，在设立临时委员会的时候，我们曾听到说临时委员会必须设立，因为安理会没有行动。而当临时委员会设立起来之后，结果竟因为安理会已在行动而不能够行动。他们曾经警告过，并且现在也警告我们的各位同人，不要玩弄这种诡计，如果确是如此的话，这有什么好处呢？尤其是因为它们关系于我们的宪章。皮尔逊先生所企图证明的主要的东西又是同样的一件东西即是：说什么在安理会无法行动时，就需要使得联合国组织能够行动。但是我们必需研究本质，我们应当找出何以在按你所谓安理会不行动时，就会发生这种不正常的形势呢？是不是在安理会工作的组织形式与原则之外还存在任何理由呢？问题是否在于以将那种不牺牲宪章就不能授予联大的权利授予联大，或者是否需要改变某些国家对于解决某种问题的政治方针，就是说：改变这些国家的外交政策呢？美国几年前就曾改变其政策。从战时的合作政策走上战后的“强硬方针”的政策。一项政策方针与另一方针相矛盾，没有比这更好的例子了。
    现在费点脑筋想想：假使你们从这个新的所谓“强硬方针”（这个方针显然是没有产生任何结果而且也不能产生什么结果的），回到旧日的合作方针，情形会怎样。在老方针下，曾存在过同样的否决权与同样的安全理事会，而那时曾有过合作。试再回到这条方针来，或许就会有些变化了。放弃对和你有同等权利的主权国家发号施令的作法吧。
    有人说：没有人企图削弱联合国组织。据说：相反的，“七国”提案将使这个组织的加强。但是如何加强呢？唯一的办法就是这一事实，即：提案的目的是在于违反宪章，这从分析一下这个提案的“丙”“丁”两节就可以看出来。
    有人说：“七国”提案还是为了要加强联合国组织的，为了证实这事，他们甚至提到北大西洋联盟的建立，显然要想证明这种“区域”措施也是所谓加强联合国组织的。但是大家都知道，北大西洋联盟的目的并不是要加强联合国组织，而相反地，是要削弱它。在这里捧出宪章第五十一条与第五十二条是文不对题的，因为谈到北大西洋联盟，过去就不会有，现在也不会有什么自卫的问题存在。
    事实上，这个联盟是打算来“防卫”谁的呢？为什么北大西洋联盟否定了苏联与人民民主国家参加的可能性呢？另一方面，为什么这个所谓区域联盟不是包括某一确定的地区，而是包括一个字眼意义极为广泛的“区域”呢？是如果把正在力求参加该公约的土耳其也包括在内的话，这个字眼的意义就尤其广泛了。
    创立北大西洋联盟的全部历史以及该联盟的一切活动证实：这个联盟并不是防卫那些根本没有人向它们进攻，而且也没有人打算向它们进攻的国家的工具，而是大西洋两岸亦即两个半球的美英两国统治集团的政策的工具。
    有人企图证明：北大西洋联盟的目的是在加强联合国组织，而且这个联盟的创立完全符合联合国组织的宗旨与任务。然而，俗话说得好：事情总会水落石出的，要掩盖下列的事实是不可能的，即北大西洋联盟的建立完全不是为了防卫，象它的创始人所屡次说过的那样。举例来说，我们只消回想一下邱吉尔在美国总统杜鲁门主持下的富尔顿会议上所发表的演说就够了，而且对于“防卫”一词会有什么意义，也就无可怀疑了。只要追忆一下美国许多权威代表人物，例如麦克阿瑟、前国防部长詹逊、海军部长马休斯这些人谈论这一“防”线所经地区的言论，就很可以知道，争论中的问题丝毫不是什么防卫问题，而是为执行美国扩张主义政策创造适当的条件。
    据说“七国”提案将能够创立安理会的代替物。
    但是，即使采取这种观点，然而看来这个所谓代替物之所以为代替物，只是因为用这种方法把迄今为止并未使它变成代替物的那种权利授予联合国大会。也就是说：联合国大会被授予迄今为止这个所谓代替物尚未赋有的权力。换句话说，它正被授予新的权力、新的权利，这些权力与权利同时严重地违反了宪章，违反了对宪章提出修正案时所应遵循的既定程序。
    这里，我必须接着谈到菲律宾代表罗慕洛的发言，罗慕洛对这个论题比别人谈得更明确些，就是说：给予大会新的权利。
    我必须对他意在表示安理会“无足轻重”的许多比拟与论断略而不提，这些比拟与论断是绝不能予以同意的。我要谈论一些最重要的问题，尤其是七国提案中关于规定成立委员会以考察组织集体自卫所必需之资源的那一段。罗慕洛忘记了争论的问题不是谁来搜集关于资源与武装部队的情报，而是谁来使用这些情报，谁来运用这些情报的问题。问题是要成立专门机构，假如要用军事方法抵御侵略者以保卫和平之时，这个机构必须根据关于某些国家所有的资源、手段与武装部队的情报来拟订作战计划。自然，成立这种专门委员会并赋予这种职能、赋予归纳文件和作出结论、准备必要可行的措施的职权——所有这些当然是明显违犯宪章的。成立这样的委员会，只会减少联合国大会的权力，因为，这样一来，拟订抵抗侵略的集体行动的将是少数联合国会员国组成的委员会而不是有联合国一切会员国代表参加的联合国大会本身了。罗慕洛不想同意这种见解，因为他不明白争论的本质。争论的本质其实是存在的，在于谁来利用这些材料，然后又由谁来制订联合国组织将来必须付诸实施的这个军事行动计划呢？这样的计划应该在谁的领导下制订呢？我们说：在军事参谋团的领导下，和在军事参谋团的上级机关安全理事会的领导下。这需要获得关于联合国各会员国的资源，它们的武装部队，兵种，以及军队和军备的质和量等各方面的情报。应该由谁来处理这一切呢？由军事参谋团及其机构来处理，因为宪章上是这样规定的。有人说要成立某种专门的资源委员会来做这种工作，那就是说不是由军事参谋团，不是由安全理事会，而是由联合国大会来做。正是这种主张违背了宪章。罗慕洛先生说：这个专门委员会首先将收集情报，其次把情报交给秘书长。而秘书长则根据“七国”提案将这些情报送呈联合国大会或安全理事会。但正如俗语所说：为什么要“用右手去抓左耳”，为什么要建立这种复杂的制度呢？——委员会收集情报，将情报交给秘书长，再由秘书长将情报送呈联合国大会或安全理事会。
    在宪章已经建立了有秩序的制度：安全理事会，军事参谋团与军事专家，那么这一切的用处是什么呢？但是，这儿有人想破坏这个制度，因为有人要以新职能与新权利授予联合国大会，从而创造一种有正如“七国”提案的起草人所说的安全理事会的“代替物”。而创造代替物的意义是什么呢？它意味着创立一个同等重要的机关，这样就把安理会及其大国一致原则及“否决权”搬下台。我们不怀疑这将继续到杜勒斯先生在他的著作里那样坦白地说到的时机来到为止。我们不同意这一点，我们不能同意是因为这个提案缺乏逻辑，即使有人假定这个提案是合乎逻辑并且是有理由的话，那么就发生这样的问题：在联大的权利与权力方面所提出的变更是否真是新的呢？是否它们并不如此重要以致不需要适用宪章一百零九条以及同时适用一百零八条？这些条文决定了提出对宪章的修正案与变更宪章的程序。
    我请求诸位注意这个事实：即在宪章的这一章仅有这两条，一百零八条与一百零九条，这里丝毫没有提到重要或不重要的修正案，重要或不重要的改变，因为一百零九条说的是宪章中的任何改变。而下面就是为提出任何改变所规定的条件：
    （一）召集特别会议，（二）联合国会员国三分之二的多数（而不是简单多数）接受修正案；（三）联合国会员国按照它们的立法程序批准这些修正案。
    姑且假定七国代表团提案全是正确的。我们并不认为如此，我们反对它，但只姑且假定宪章确实必须修改吧。好，这是一份宪章，这是第一百零八条，这是第一百零九条里，请按照这些条所指示的合乎宪章的方式行事吧。
    为什么你们不想按照这种方式行动呢？一位代表说：“请苏联代表团答应，如果举行这种会议，苏联代表团将同意修改宪章。”这是幼稚的提问题的方法。召开会议不是为了登记一个人出了席。召开会议是要讨论提出的问题。如果所提的建议是可以接受的，我们就接受它们，如果它们是不可接受的，我们就反对它。我们不会以不正当的方式去反对。我们将按照宪章的要求，在宪章所容许的范围内从事反对。
    我们说：姑且假定你们是对的。姑且假定目前的宪章、安理会和一般的联合国组织的事态确实是使宪章中所规定的东西在目前情况下不足以达成我们正为之而奋斗的目标。可能的确会发生这种情况，在这种情况之下宪章这个活的有机体有了发展，而且或许会需要某些修改。在这种情形下，只能采取为修改宪章而规定的唯一的合法途径，宪章所规定的途径。你们为什么不愿是这条路呢？在我看来，这个问题已经有了答复。
    在已经提出的许多问题中，最重要的一个是大会应该作出的建议的性质问题。这里也有无可争辩的规定：大会的多数有权召开特别会议；它有权紧急地召开特别会议；它有权讨论任何问题，而不必提交任何委员会，也不必成立任何委员会；它有权对这些属于联合国组织的任何机构管辖范围之内的问题提出建议，只有两种情形例外。有人说只有一种例外。但我们肯定有两种。一种是宪章第十二条所规定的。那就是当问题已列在安理会议程上的时候。在这种情况下，大会不能对这问题提出建议，虽然大会本身也可能正在讨论这个问题。关于第十二条中所规定的这种情况，我们的意见并无分歧。
    然而还有第二种大会不能提出建议的情况。那就是当大会的建议不是别的，而是要求、责成、或邀请安理会或任何其他机构采取行动的时候。在这两种情况下大会不能提出任何建议。“七国”提案的起草人正是规避了第二种情况，并且错误地规避了它。
    杜勒斯和若干其他代表为了证明他们立场的正确性，曾引述了“有经验的法律家的话”。让我也来引述一下“有经验的”法律家的话吧，这些法律家正是英美人士中的权威。
    维辛斯基引述了著名教授凯尔逊所著《联合国法》一书。该书第二百页到二百零四页讨论宪章第十一条所规定的大会权限问题。维辛斯基说，它以第十一条第二款最后一句话的观点审查了这个问题。这句话是：“对必需采取行动的问题，将由大会提交安理会……”。
    凯尔逊的书在这一点上说道，第十一条第二款包括第十条所未包括的限制。第十条只述及第十二条的规定，并未述及第十一条第二款关于这样事实的规定，即：凡联合国组织的会员国、安理会、或非联合国组织的国家按照第三十五条第二款向大会提出的任何有关维护国际和平与安全的问题，如果必需采取行动的话，都应由大会在讨论前或讨论后提交安理会。这意味着大会按照第十一条第二款可以讨论这种问题，但不可以作任何建议。联合国大会必须将问题提交安全理事会，即使这个问题已经由安全理事会本身根据十一条第二款提交联合国大会。不仅当问题是争端或（其他）情势、当安理会正在处理这问题的时候（十二条第一款），而且当这个问题需要采取行动的时候都不作出建议。维辛斯基进一步说道：在凯尔逊教授著作第二百零四、二百零五页中所分析的就是“行动”的概念。他问道“行动”是指的什么呢？这是很重要的问题，因为我们假如不彻底明了它的意义，自己就会陷入与目前杜勒斯在援引葛罗米柯的一段话时同样的困难中。他说：葛罗米柯曾于一九四六年宣称在安全理事会上有人争辩说必须由联合国大会去采取行动，而现在在联合国大会上却又有人断言这个问题是属于安全理事会范围内的。联合国大会有权力和权利来考虑这个问题并对它作出决议，不行动的政策会招致严重的后果。
    在葛罗米柯的说话中有什么是和我刚才对第一委员会所说的话相矛盾的呢？葛罗米柯说：联合国大会有权行动，那就是说：有权审议在联合国任何机构范围内的问题。
    这就是宪章上所谓“行动”，“行动”意指大会可考虑问题并就这些问题作出建议。
    为着清楚起见，我来心平气和毫无偏见地举一个例子。这个例子可说明“行动”对大会说是什么意思，和“不行动”又是什么意思。
    大家自然都记得几天以前，苏联代表团在此提出了希腊死刑的问题。我们请第一委员会首先讨论这个问题，并通过决议授权大会主席与希腊政府磋商以制止这些死刑的执行，或者如厄瓜多尔去年提案中所说的，探询希腊政府对于是否可能停止执行这些死刑的态度和观点。然而，这个提案还未被接受，并且甚至未予讨论。我希望该案将得到讨论，但现在尚未予以讨论。我们提出这个问题，因为这是人道问题，因而这个问题自然与我们联合国组织的任务、理想和宗旨密切地关联着，并且我们自然可以讨论它，联合国组织应当在这件事上有所行动。鉴于宪章中规定不干涉他国内政的第二条第七款，我们并不主张作出建议，但是我们却要求人道。我们可以讨论任何问题，所以我们在说大会也可讨论这个问题时是不错的，去年大会讨论过类似问题并通过了相应的决议就证明了这一点。
    如果大会拒绝讨论它的任务范围之内的问题中的某一个问题，那它就表明缺乏行动。我们深信，第一委员会对于我们所提出的审议被判死刑的希腊爱国志士十一个母亲来信的请求，每一个钟头，每一天的延宕都是能够牺牲这些爱国志士性命的缺乏行动的行为。相反的，审议这个问题就可以说是大会采取了“行动”。凯尔逊在他的基本著作里研究“行动”这一概念的法律含意，并确定其意义一方面既适用于安理会的职能而另一方面也适用于大会的职能时，他完全是正确的其原因就在这里。
    凯尔逊提出了一个极重要的问题：宪章，中尤其是第十一条所说的“行动”一词的意义是什么？虽说杜勒斯本人是一个著名的律师，但他对于这个法律问题一贯不大重视。他说：我们不讨论法律上的问题。但是我们的代表团认为不应当这样来处理问题，因为不先对宪章和建议中的大会权利和权力的变更有一个正确的法律上的了解，就不可能对我们所面对着的问题得到正确的解决。凯尔逊教授在为宪章第十一条的“行动”一词的概念下定义时说，“行动”一词的含意只能是付诸实施的行动。接着凯尔逊写道，这种行动是安全理事会的专门职能。在这种情形下，而且只有在这种情形下，联合国大会才不应该作出建议，而应将问题提交安全理事会。关于是否有采取任何行动的必要的问题是应由大会决定的，因为只有在有必要采取行动的时候大会才须将问题提交安全理事会。但是在讨论“以前”这种决定便差不多没有可能作出来。
    维辛斯基说，这是不是很清楚呢？当然，这是十分清楚的。
    维辛斯基继续说，先生们，这就是为什么不管从政治观点或法律观点来说，我们都不能赞成“七国”提案里的建议，不能赞成建议授权大会来对付诸实施的行动作出建议的原因，因为，根据具有充分经验的权威者的解释，并且根据我们的了解，“行动”这个字在宪章上没有而且不可能有任何其他的意义。我们是反对将作出这样一种建议的权利授予大会，而不是一般地反对它的建议权。有人向我们说：你们一般地反对建议权。不，我们并不是一般地反对大会提出建议的权利。大会有提出建议的权利，但没有提出会引起行动、即使用武装部队的那种建议的权利，因为宪章并没有赋与大会这种权利，因为依照宪章，只有安理会才可以采取这种行动。同时，我们所引的凯尔逊的话也可以证实这一点。
    这就是我们对我们迄今所提关于正在审议中的问题的论据所可能作的补充。我不拟论及某些次要的问题。在我看来，这些问题与需要我们注意、而且必须充分根据宪章及其原则加以决定的问题相比，是居于次要地位的，因为违犯这些原则，就会对国际和平与安全的事业充满严重的后果，而决不能有益于那些把我们团结在联合国组织之内的崇高目的。
