Xinhua News Agency, 5th: According to TASS on the 2nd, the representative conference of Taiwanese Overseas Chinese residing in Japan has issued a petition to the UN General Assembly and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Stalin. Representing 40,000 Taiwanese Overseas Chinese residing in Japan, they submitted the following requests to the UN General Assembly: (1) It should be confirmed that Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory; (2) Immediate measures should be taken to stop foreign illegal actions of direct interference in Taiwan; (3) If a Chinese delegation responsible to the Chinese people is not participating, the UN General Assembly or the Security Council must not take any action regarding Taiwan; any other action taken will be considered invalid by all Chinese people.

The petition, after pointing out that the Cairo Conference, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Japanese Instrument of Surrender all clearly stipulated that Taiwan be returned to China, continued: Since international agreements recognize that Taiwan is part of China, and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a country is an established international law, any foreign armed forces entering Taiwan should be regarded as an act of direct military interference. This act of interference constitutes a clear threat to peace and must be stopped immediately.

The petition refuted the so-called "trusteeship" proposal, and pointed out that the so-called "Taiwan independence movement" is instigated by foreign countries and has no popular support. The Chinese people demand that Taiwan be part of China.

The petition was signed by Gan Wenfang, Zeng Senmao, Wu Rongzang, Chen Kunwang, and twelve others on behalf of the representative conference of Taiwanese Overseas Chinese residing in Japan.

　　旅日台湾籍华侨四万人
    致书联合国大会和斯大林  强调指出台湾是中国领土
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社二日讯：旅日台湾籍华侨代表会议顷发表致联合国大会和苏联部长会议主席斯大林请愿书一件，代表四万名旅居日本的台湾籍华侨，向联合国大会提出下列要求：（一）应确证台湾是中国领土不可分的一部分；（二）立即采取措施制止外国直接干涉台湾非法的行动；（三）如果没有能对中国人民负责的中国代表团参加，联合国大会或安全理事会不得采取关于台湾的任何行动；如采取任何其他行动，将被所有的中国人民认为无效。
    请愿书在指出开罗会议、波茨坦公告及日本降书均明确规定台湾归还中国后，继称：由于国际协定承认台湾是中国的一部分，而不干涉一国内政的原则又是确定不移的国际法规，所以，任何外国武装部队开到台湾，都应被视为一种直接军事干涉的行为。这种干涉行为构成对和平的明显威胁，必须立即采取措施加以制止。
    请愿书驳斥了所谓“托管”的主张，并指出所谓“台湾独立运动”，是外国所策动的，没有人民支持的。中国人民要求台湾成为中国的一部分。
    请愿书由甘文芳、曾森茂、吴荣藏、陈焜旺等十二人代表旅日台湾籍华侨代表会议签名。
