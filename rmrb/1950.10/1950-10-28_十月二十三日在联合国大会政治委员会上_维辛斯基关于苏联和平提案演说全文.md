The full text of Vyshinsky's speech at the Political Committee on October 23 is as follows:

On September 20, the Soviet delegation submitted to the United Nations General Assembly its proposals aimed at stopping the threat of a new war and strengthening the peace and security of all nations.

In its statement to the Assembly, the Soviet delegation had already enumerated some of the basic motives that led the Soviet government to propose that the fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly discuss this issue and adopt the draft declaration submitted by the Soviet delegation. We then emphasized that if the General Assembly adopts this declaration calling for a resolute and vigorous struggle against the threat of a new war and for the peace and security of all nations, it will have immense significance.

In the current international situation, the adoption of this declaration is of particular importance; at present, the war is raging in Korea and other parts of the Far East, and the instigators of the new war, who threaten the vital interests and well-being of all mankind, continue their intrigues without pause.

On the other hand, hundreds of millions of working people are raising a powerful voice of protest against the preparation for a new war, demanding that governments take decisive and unwavering measures to strengthen peace, stop the threat of a new war, and ensure the security of the peoples of all nations.

The Soviet delegation believes that for the defense of peace, the task facing the United Nations General Assembly has never been as important as it is now. The proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation are aimed at achieving the purposes and principles of the United Nations as stated and enumerated in the chapter on the purposes and principles of the United Nations in our Charter. This idea of the struggle for peace is very prominent throughout our entire draft declaration. The preamble of the declaration emphasizes that the events now developing in Korea and other parts of the Pacific confirm with new force: the joint peace efforts of the five great powers—the permanent members of the Security Council, who bear a special responsibility for maintaining international peace—are of great importance and urgency for the cause of peace and security of all nations.

It is unnecessary to emphasize that the efforts of the permanent members of the Security Council for peace are closely linked with the efforts of all other peace-loving nations—the small and medium-sized nations—with the efforts of all those who strive to avoid the war that would bring unspeakable suffering and misery to the peoples, and with the efforts of all those who strive to promote the development of friendly relations among nations and cooperation in the settlement of international problems, thereby maintaining and strengthening world peace.

The Soviet Union has consistently and resolutely pursued a policy of peace and has waged an unyielding struggle to strengthen international cooperation.

Despite encountering many obstacles on the path to strengthening peace and cooperation among nations, the Soviet Union has steadfastly and firmly pursued this path. The Soviet Union knows and is convinced that this fully corresponds to the hopes and wishes of the Soviet people and all other peace-loving nations; it corresponds to the interests of all mankind.

Many facts and documents in the history of the Soviet state and its foreign policy prove that the Soviet government has waged a resolute and unyielding struggle for peace and the strengthening of international cooperation. These facts prove that the Soviet government, since the early days of the Great October Revolution, has made tremendous efforts to achieve the goal of peace and to create conditions for the socialist society, the socialist state of workers and peasants. The Soviet people, engaged in the labor of peaceful construction, have no warlike intentions and no war plans. The Soviet people hate war; they are making great efforts to stop the threat of a new war and to ensure the peace and security that our people urgently need to complete the construction of socialism victoriously. All the creative forces of the Soviet Union and its great people are directed towards achieving the goal of peace. The science and technology of the Soviet Union serve peace, serve the labor of peaceful construction. The entire Soviet industry, the entire Soviet national economy, are developing in the same direction.

The idea of peace and creative efforts for peace permeate the entire life of the Soviet Union. No matter what the warmongers say, no matter how hard they try to deceive the people with their vile slanders against the Soviet Union, we believe that in any part of the world, no honest person will believe the slanderous fabrications that the Soviet Union has war plans against other countries, against other nations.

These dishonest people, for their own selfish interests, try to destroy the trust of the peoples of all nations in the peaceful policy of the Soviet Union by spreading various malicious fabrications and slanders against the socialist countries, but no matter what attempts they make, they cannot eradicate from the hearts of billions of ordinary people around the world the firm conviction that it is the Soviet Union that is the bastion of peace, the steadfast and loyal defender of peace; the Soviet Union—as the head of the Soviet government, Stalin, has said—is able to and actually does follow a policy of peace, not hypocritically, but sincerely and openly, resolutely and consistently.

Anyone who tries to deceive honest people on this issue is doomed to failure, because no one can cover up their hostility towards the Soviet Union with hysterical outcries, with fabrications such as the Soviet Union believing that socialist and capitalist countries cannot coexist peacefully, and that the Soviet Union is not striving for cooperation and friendly relations with other countries, especially those with different social and political systems.

All these hostile plots against the Soviet Union have been refuted by many convincing facts, refuted by the thirty-year history of the Soviet state, by the entire course and content of the peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet Union.

However, what about the questions that are constantly raised at international conferences and especially at the United Nations? This question is about the possibility of peaceful coexistence and cooperation between the Soviet Union—the socialist state—and capitalist countries. This question has already attracted much attention and has been thoroughly discussed at the sessions of the General Assembly, although some delegations have distorted historical facts and misrepresented this question. However, this question seems not to have been thoroughly discussed, because at this session some delegations have tried to raise this question again. Although I do not like to talk too much, I still think it is necessary to discuss this question and to recall some important facts to fully elucidate this question.

The fact is this:

In 1927, when receiving the first American labor delegation, J. V. Stalin pointed out that the existence of two opposite systems—capitalist and socialist—does not exclude the possibility of agreements between the Soviet Union and capitalist countries in industry, commerce, and diplomatic relations.

In this meeting, J. V. Stalin said: "I think that such agreements are possible and desirable in conditions of peaceful development. Import and export are the most suitable places for such agreements. We need machines, raw materials (such as cotton), semi-finished products (metals, etc.), while capitalists need markets for such goods. This provides the basis for agreements. Capitalists need products such as oil, timber, grain, while we need markets for these goods. This also provides the basis for agreements. We need credit loans, while capitalists need high interest from credit loans. This is another basis for agreements in the field of credit loans. It is well known that Soviet institutions pay on time."

A lot of time has passed since then; our needs have changed during this period. Many things we no longer need to obtain through commercial agencies from capitalist countries, but even now, the issue of trade relations has not lost its strength and has not lost its significance in strengthening international relations. The reason I recall these words of the head of the Soviet government to the American labor delegation in 1927 is mainly to show: if there is goodwill and a sincere effort for true cooperation, there are many possibilities for establishing and strengthening international relations, which will help to strengthen international peace and security.

In this meeting, J. V. Stalin emphasized that the Soviet Union is pursuing a policy of peace and is willing to sign non-aggression treaties with capitalist countries and to conclude agreements with them on issues such as disarmament. Stalin, in that meeting with the American delegation, after recalling the agreements already concluded with other countries, announced: "We hope that these agreements will have some durability, but he warned: 'This, of course, depends not only on us, but also on the other side.'"

Since the 1920s, despite the fact that some countries, such as the United States, did not recognize the Soviet Union at that time and in the subsequent sixteen years, and used various methods to oppose this recognition, to oppose the demands of American public opinion and progressive people in other capitalist countries for the United States to abandon its absurd policy of boycotting the young Soviet state, the Soviet Union still tried to cooperate peacefully with other countries, even those with different social, economic, and political systems, and succeeded in improving relations with some countries and concluding several treaties with them on issues such as trade and technical assistance.

It was precisely at this time, despite the fact that the Soviet Union was subjected to the boycott of several capitalist countries and major powers such as the United States, that the Soviet Union joined the Kellogg-Briand Pact and, in accordance with this pact and other countries, signed protocols and waged an active struggle for collective security. Since the 1920s, the Soviet Union has actively participated in several conferences held under the auspices of the League of Nations; it was not someone else, but the Soviet government that, in February 1933, proposed the adoption of a definition of aggression and aggressors. Although many countries supported this proposal, and the majority of the Security Council, composed of seventeen representatives, generally adopted this proposal, it was rejected by the conference at that time, which acted according to the instructions of the representatives of the British and French governments.

However, the Soviet Union, with most of its Western and Southern neighbors (including Finland, Poland), as well as the so-called Little Entente countries, concluded a convention on the definition of aggressors. At the same time, it concluded non-aggression pacts with the same neighbors and with countries such as France and Italy.

The majority of the countries in the League of Nations opposed the direction of the international policy that the Soviet Union was then vigorously pursuing and rejected the Soviet peace proposals. The Soviet Union overcame all these obstacles, followed this path of strengthening peace, initiated and supported the initiatives of several other countries, concluded treaties and agreements that were not just words, but real actions. This is precisely what some representatives have underestimated, who use clichés to respond to our proposals on peace and measures to strengthen peace. They say: "Do not just use words, but use actions to prove that you are truly prepared to implement these measures." They raise these questions to avoid the necessity of supporting the Soviet proposals, to defeat the Soviet proposals under some pretext (as I said just now, they say: these are all empty words, you must show with actions how your words and proposals will be implemented); is it not clear that the facts I have just mentioned have refuted any attempt they might make?

I have listed some facts that show how the words and proposals of the Soviet Union have always been consistently implemented and realized, as long as these proposals receive even a little support from other delegations, other countries, as long as these countries express even a little willingness to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union, with the Soviet government on some real issues.

This was the peace foreign policy of the Soviet Union at that time. The years before the Second World War and the years after the war also provide many examples. At this time, due to the initiative and efforts of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union not only proposed but also established serious and friendly relations and connections with many countries.

The leaders of the Soviet Union have pointed out more than once that the foreign policy of the Soviet Union stems from the belief that the long-term coexistence of socialist and capitalist systems is inevitable and possible. The Soviet Union believes that peaceful cooperation with those governments that are prepared to act with mutual concern and are sincerely fulfilling their international obligations is fully feasible and possible.

In September 1946, the Sunday Times correspondent in Moscow, A. Worsley, asked the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin: "As the Soviet Union advances further towards communism, will the possibility of peaceful cooperation with the outside world not decrease? The head of the Soviet government, Joseph Stalin, replied at that time:

"I have no doubt that the possibility of peaceful cooperation will not only not decrease but may even increase."

It was also in 1946 that Elliott Roosevelt asked Joseph Stalin: "Do you believe that the United States can coexist peacefully with a government like the Soviet Union, which is communist in form, and that neither side will attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of the other?"

Joseph Stalin replied at that time: "I certainly believe it. This is not only possible. It is also wise and fully realizable. During the most difficult times of the war, when the difference in government forms did not prevent our two countries from uniting and defeating our enemies, then to continue this relationship in peacetime is even more possible."

Joseph Stalin emphasized in May 1948: "The Soviet government believes: 'Despite differences in economic systems and ideologies, for the sake of universal peace, the coexistence of these systems and the peaceful resolution of disputes between the Soviet Union and the United States are not only possible but absolutely necessary.'"

Everyone also knows that Joseph Stalin's historically significant reply to the question of the head of the European branch of the International News Service, Smith, at that time, the head of the Soviet government said: "Of course, the Soviet government can cooperate with the government of the United States of America in taking measures to implement this peace treaty and in gradually implementing disarmament."

These few words of the great leader of the Soviet Union determined the entire line of Soviet foreign policy, which is consistently pursuing the goal of serving the fundamental interests of the Soviet people and all peace-loving nations.

In my opinion, these facts are sufficient to silence the slanderers—all those who make a profession of spreading vile fabrications, slandering the Soviet Union and its foreign policy, slandering its sincerity and its true desire to cooperate for the interests of all peace-loving nations.

What is the foreign policy of the United States? It turns out that the foreign policy of the United States is completely different. The foreign policy of the United States is another kind. The head of the State Department, in his speech on February 16, based on the "total war" called this foreign policy "total diplomacy," and this definition fully and eloquently explains what American diplomacy actually is. To remove any doubt on this point, Mr. Acheson, in the same speech, emphasized that American leaders oppose any benevolent tolerance in relations with the Soviet Union and say that only the creation of a situation of strength can deal with the Soviet Union.

A few days later, in another speech, Mr. Acheson, in discussing American-Soviet relations, reiterated this idea, this time with a detailed explanation. In discussing American foreign policy, he said that our basic policy is to create a situation that will expand the scope of possible agreements, that is, to create strength in place of the weakness that now exists in many places.... He continued, saying that the entire purpose of the European economic recovery plan (that is, the Marshall Plan) is to create strength in place of weakness.... He also said that this is the purpose of military aid, the purpose of the Fourth Point Plan.

Therefore, if we analyze Mr. Acheson's statements (and I have only quoted some of his many statements, which may not be strong enough but, in my opinion, are quite clear statements), we can see that the State Department of the United States (which, of course, is mainly responsible for American foreign policy, along with other high-ranking leaders of the United States who are also responsible for this policy) believes that the solution of undecided diplomatic policy issues, that is, the foreign policy of the State Department, is only a policy that must be implemented with such strong arguments as armed forces, as the army, as the navy, as the air force, by force, pressure, and command. The political leaders of the United States, in all their speeches, deliberately emphasize this—like showing off—precisely the importance of force in the external political activities of the American government. This provides sufficient grounds to say that force constitutes the basis of the entire foreign policy of the Anglo-American bloc. I am using the term Anglo-American bloc, but I understand that in this matter, the decisive role still belongs to the United States of America, not to mention some other countries. These countries, I regret to say, are greatly dependent on the United States economically. Not only do the leaders and important officials of the United States openly say that force is the main tool and weapon for regulating international relations, but the ministers of other countries also repeat the same tune.

For example, according to the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Bevin, Britain's foreign policy follows the same line. According to the New York Times, Mr. Bevin recently said that because the strength of the Western countries has increased, it is possible to solve world problems through direct talks between the great powers.

What does this mean? This means that only when a person feels confident in his own strength can he negotiate with the Soviet Union. In other words, this means that only when these governments, which intend to negotiate with the Soviet Union on how to solve certain unresolved international problems, are armed to the teeth, can they negotiate with the Soviet Union. A person who negotiates with another country in this attitude, first showing a fist in armor and other characteristics of his "diplomatic" preparation for the negotiations, the result will be obvious.

According to Bevin's statement, strength is a prerequisite for solving world problems, and these problems can only be solved under the threat of the use of armed force if necessary. These words reveal the true direction of the foreign policy of the Anglo-American bloc.

When discussing the situation in which the United Nations Organization discussed the Anglo-American bloc's proposal for joint action to ensure peace—the second item on the agenda we have just completed—Mr. Bevin presented the matter as if the Assembly were authorized to control the armed forces and, through negotiations with the relevant countries, promote the resolution of unresolved problems; therefore, in this matter, it is also aimed at the factor of force, I should even say the factor of intimidation and causing fear in the other party—this is quite obvious.

It is unnecessary to say more; in general, a policy based on such principles is reckless and will not yield any results, and it is especially so for the Soviet Union.

Arguments such as force, threats about certain special consequences of these negotiations, can only have a negative effect on the Soviet Union. Other partners should be chosen for such experiments. The Soviet Union is certainly not suitable for such experiments.

The leaders of the aggressive bloc worship weapons of mass destruction and attempt to establish relations with the Soviet Union by force.

Mr. Bevin declared that the British government still believes that the United Nations Organization is a tool for resolving international disputes and that it is necessary to establish the North Atlantic Treaty and other similar measures to strengthen its position; he said this more clearly when he mentioned the North Atlantic Treaty. It is very clear to say that the aggressive nature of the North Atlantic Treaty is known to everyone and does not need special proof, of course, if someone raises any objections in this regard, I will not refuse to provide evidence to prove the correctness of this statement.

To make it clear to everyone what Mr. Bevin thinks about the Soviet Union, we must pay attention to a paragraph in his speech. In that paragraph, he said: "Western countries must become strong, and then the four-power talks will produce good results." Bevin's statement attracted the attention of the newspapers. For example, the New York Times—a newspaper you all know—when commenting on Bevin's statement, recalled (not coincidentally) Churchill's statement. Churchill said: "The further development of events will depend on how Western diplomacy uses the 'breathing space' given to the West by the atomic bomb." The newspaper commented on Bevin's speech, saying that the only way to safety is to restore the former military power of Western Europe.

To use such inhumane weapons of mass destruction to obtain a "breathing space" between two wars, to propagate the atomic bomb as a tool for defending peace, and to depict this inhumane weapon of death as a source of life, is there anything more shameful than this?

We can hardly imagine anything more shameful than this.

The leaders of the Anglo-American bloc declare that the worship of force, the worship of atomic weapons, is the main driving force of the external relations of the United States, Britain, and other countries that have joined the North Atlantic Treaty, the main lever and pivot of the entire foreign policy.

These facts show what the essence of the foreign policy of the United States and its allies—Britain and France—is.

It is clear that the high-ranking politicians of the Anglo-American camp are trying to establish relations with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries by force, and they are trying to determine the possibility of cooperation with the Soviet Union by the comparison of their forces—I say again, by the comparison of their military forces.

President Truman's recent speech in San Francisco proves that the entire line of American foreign policy is determined by that force. In this speech, the American president tried to defend the aggressive line of the current American ruling class, calling this line a line that America was "forced" to adopt. He then used sufficient anti-Soviet fabrications to cover up the actual content and nature of this line; this line, which crazily expands armaments and prepares for a new war, is completely contradictory to his flowery rhetoric about peace.

This speech is not accidental to the American people. It warns that the American people will have to bear heavier military expenditures, that the United States—according to Truman—should use more resources for military purposes and fewer resources for consumer goods.

This is nothing but the old tune from the Hitler reactionary camp that everyone who has come out of it is familiar with—"guns before butter."

Everyone knows that the Senate Finance Committee has passed a plan to increase the total tax revenue by fifty billion dollars, which will result in an average increase of sixteen percent in personal income tax starting from October 1 this year, in addition to other tax increases.

These facts show that the talk about collective security, the desire for peace—this peace, which Mr. Acheson says must be a moral peace, giving people the possibility of uniting in brotherhood—etc., is worthless! It is clear that these empty words are used to deceive the people of their own country and other countries, to make them not see the true nature of American foreign policy, which is based on the use of force to deal with other countries.

These facts fully expose the hypocrisy and insincerity of the many leaders of the Anglo-American camp who have issued statements about their willingness to cooperate with the Soviet Union. They make these statements with preliminary conditions, requiring the Soviet Union to provide evidence that it is actually implementing a policy of peace, a policy of cooperation. This fact exposes the insincerity of these statements. Such statements cannot but be considered an attempt to hide their unwillingness to cooperate with the Soviet Union, their unwillingness to cooperate with anyone for peace; they cannot but be considered an attempt to hide their desire to implement their plans and intentions of aggression unhindered, and these plans and intentions of aggression are to be on a larger scale than those already carried out in many places around the world.

The purpose of these statements is only to cover up their own violation of international agreements and to help them prepare for a new war.

On the one hand, the responsible leaders of the United States, Britain, France, and some other countries that have formed close political and military blocs with them, openly make a series of speeches, talking about the importance of international cooperation, the importance of unanimity among the permanent members of the Security Council, the necessity of consultation and agreement, also talking about the necessity of eliminating differences of opinion and reaching a decision in accordance with the requirements and principles of the United Nations Charter, and sometimes even pass some resolutions in this spirit, as shown in the recent discussion of the so-called "joint action to ensure peace" at the meeting. Although on the one hand there are these beautiful speeches and not bad proposals, such as the joint proposal of Syria and Iraq, etc., and the so-called joint efforts to ensure peace, on the other hand, they openly violate the obligations stipulated in the international agreements and treaties they have previously concluded, and the acts of sabotage incompatible with the task of strengthening peace.

Examples of the violation of international agreements on extremely important issues, I can cite the policy of the United States, Britain, and France towards Germany, and the fact that they have completely violated the obligations they assumed in the Potsdam Agreement. Let us recall what Dulles said more than once at the last meeting; he said: "We will never go back to Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam."

After the three governments of the United States, Britain, and France took the path of dividing Germany and drawing Germany into their military aggression plans, they are now taking measures to restore the West German army and remilitarize West Germany, which can be seen very clearly in the statement issued by the three foreign ministers on September 19 this year. This statement blatantly violates and betrays the Potsdam Agreement; in that agreement, the four powers all pledged not to allow Germany to be remilitarized, not to allow Germany to become the center of terror for the whole world (first and foremost for Europe), and not to allow it to become the breeding ground for war that the German revanchists and the reactionary groups of the United States, Britain, and France dream of.

These countries want to join hands to use the manpower and resources of Western Germany to serve their imperialist interests and to implement their strategic plans; behind this plan is the ambition of the American ruling class to gain world hegemony. They use the end of the state of war with Germany as a pretext and strive to create conditions to openly bring Western Germany into the so-called North Atlantic Alliance, the aggressive bloc, and to turn Western Germany completely into a tool for their aggressive strategic plans in Europe.

This is the policy of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France towards Germany; the statement issued by the foreign ministers of the eight countries at the conference in Prague, which has just closed, correctly pointed out the characteristics of this policy.

The former Nazi generals, such as Halder, Guderian, and Manstein, are participating in the work of restoring the West German army and are preparing to put this army at the disposal of the Anglo-American bloc. In Western Germany and the Western sectors of Berlin, there are now 450,000 soldiers disguised as police but actually as the army, including tank and artillery units. In fact, the regular West German army, commanded by former fascist officers and generals, has been restored and is now active and expanding in the Western sectors of Berlin and Western Germany.

These facts indisputably prove that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France have completely violated their obligations to establish a unified, democratic, and peaceful Germany, as pointed out in the statement issued by the eight foreign ministers in Prague on the decision of the New York three-power conference to remilitarize Western Germany.

This is the foreign policy of the United States and Britain, attempting to use the military forces of Western Germany in Europe and Japan in the Far East to achieve their aggressive purposes.

To enforce their will, to—as they imagine—implement this policy, they are trying to arm themselves to the teeth. For several years, they have pinned their hopes on the atomic bomb, but they have failed. Now, they are pinning their hopes on the hydrogen bomb, but we can say: gentlemen! This will also fail.

So, what should the United Nations Organization do in this situation? The path that the representatives of the United States and Britain are trying to drag the United Nations onto is to drag the member states of the United Nations into military adventures, and we know that they have sometimes succeeded in this, for example, in Korea, in the Korean issue, this is a path that will lead the United Nations Organization to its doom, which violates the principles and Charter of the United Nations. There is another path, which is not hypocritical or fabricated, but sincere and honest, to abandon the warlike plans, threats, and attempts to intimidate partners with armies; and to reach agreements on unresolved issues on the basis of equal rights and mutual respect. This is a path to reach international agreements on the basis of principles and conditions that both sides can accept.

People should realize that it is impossible to strengthen peace by talking about peace on the platforms of various international organizations while secretly, in the war departments and general staffs, crazily preparing plans to attack the countries with which they claim to negotiate.

We have not closed our eyes to the difficulties on the path to peace and the strengthening of international peace cooperation. We know that the fundamental cause of these difficulties is precisely the important situation I just mentioned—the direction of the foreign policy of certain countries (and mainly the United States, which leads the reactionary bloc of certain countries), their policy has nothing in common with the task of peace.

Everyone knows that we regard the United Nations, which we consider an important tool for peace, as capable of playing a great role in the cause of peace, if the United Nations is strong enough to resist tendencies that cannot coexist with peace and the trend of peace policy, if the United Nations has the power to oppose various adventurous plans, its active opposition can indeed make these plans fail. But for it to play this role, the United Nations must stand firmly on its feet, must have sufficient authority and influence. However, weakening this organization, destroying the foundations on which it is based, cannot give this organization power; making it powerless to act according to the laws established for it is also not giving this organization power, because these laws are supposed to be the guidelines for its actions, and it cannot act without following these laws.

So, what do we have to say about the policy that has been consistently pursued for not just one month, perhaps not just one year, against the United Nations itself? The purpose of this policy is to violate the Charter, to violate the principles of the Charter, to destroy the Charter, to destroy the United Nations institutions, such as the Security Council, which is the most responsible and important, with erroneous, illegal, and unjust decisions. The purpose of making these decisions seems to be to show complete disregard for international obligations time and time again.

This blatant violation of the Charter has become a common occurrence here. This has happened during the debates in the Security Council on the American aggression in Korea, the debate on the representation of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, and the recent debate in the Political Committee on the so-called "joint action to ensure peace" (in which sections C and D blatantly violate the Charter and are incompatible with the efforts to strengthen the United Nations). If the United Nations is not strengthened, then talking about strengthening peace is of no use, because maintaining peace depends on organized efforts, and organized efforts are made by certain organizations; if these organizations are weakened to the point of zero, the efforts they make will not produce any positive results.

People should remember that every blow to the United Nations is a serious blow to the cause of peace, because the solidity and strength of the United Nations is an important factor in the struggle to strengthen peace and international cooperation.

Let me now talk about our proposal.

At the beginning of this session of the General Assembly, during the general debate, after the Soviet delegation announced its proposal, some delegations immediately opposed the "Declaration on Stopping the Threat of a New War and Strengthening World Peace and Security" proposed by the Soviet delegation.

These delegations treated our proposal on the declaration with their usual hostility towards the Soviet Union. This time, as in previous sessions of the General Assembly, they tried not to discuss our issue but to replace it with another issue. It can be predicted that they may also try to do this here. They will try to replace our issue with the so-called "trust" and "guarantees."

It is said that our proposals to reduce armaments by one-third, to declare the use of atomic bombs as a crime, and to declare the first government to use such bombs as war criminals are dead, ineffective, and that to make them effective, guarantees are needed, and to make them effective, guarantees of trust that these proposals will be truly implemented in the future are needed.

This means that the entire issue is reduced to explaining the degree of trust, the form of trust, in a word, to replacing the issue of prohibition with the issue of trust, replacing the issue of prohibiting atomic bombs. However, it is forgotten that for trust, actual actions are necessary, and certain specific measures are necessary to serve as the basis for such trust. Guarantees of trust—this is the requirement put forward as a precondition for accepting the Soviet proposal.

Title: The Soviet Union's Proposal for the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons

I must say that this is a well-tested method, seeking to use a suitable excuse to evade discussing the issues we propose to discuss and decide on; this method has a history of at least twenty-five years. This method has been used many times on the international stage by many experienced diplomats, such as Chamberlain, Henderson, Pound, Clemenceau, Briand, and these clever masters who substitute one issue for another.

Thirty years ago, the issue raised in the League of Nations—namely, the issue of trust—was never resolved, and it was not accidental. Yet, by raising such issues, it prevented decisions from being made on important matters such as international cooperation, disarmament, universal or partial reduction of armaments, the conclusion of non-aggression pacts, and various other measures aimed at eliminating the threat of war and ensuring international security.

I must recall that the Soviet Union encountered reservations and preconditions for drafting collective security measures at least twenty-five years ago, which are exactly the same as those now proposed for discussing our draft declaration.

Massive reduction of armaments is a guarantee of security
Completion of the task of controlling atomic bombs can inspire trust
When we first proposed suggestions on disarmament and demilitarization, everyone knows that the representatives of Britain and France, who played a leading role in European affairs, and the American representatives who supported them, used the formula "first security, then disarmament" to obstruct these proposals. Now, there has been a slight change, and they say, "first trust, then disarmament, and then the prohibition of atomic weapons." The words have changed, but the meaning remains the same.

When Mr. Bevin spoke at the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly on this formula of "first security, then disarmament," he said that the British government has been following the path it has been on since the 1930s, and that the foreign minister at that time was his predecessor Henderson. According to Mr. Bevin, Henderson was then actively working for disarmament.

This statement is historically incorrect because Henderson's position was fully supportive of Pound. The formula "first establish security guarantees, then talk about disarmament" was invented by Henderson. As is known, the British delegation at that time did everything possible to make the Soviet government's disarmament proposals fail. However, Bevin did not mention a situation—this I would like to remind him—that even Henderson, who opposed disarmament and believed that security guarantees should be established first, could not but admit—and he said this—that a massive reduction in armaments would greatly promote security and thus strengthen trust, and in this way, it could be a guarantee of such trust.

Unfortunately, Mr. Bevin did not follow his predecessor in this regard—he called Henderson Mr., but remained faithful to Pound's formula. But that is his business.

My business is to point out that although a long time has passed since then, Britain's attitude towards this issue has not changed.

When Bevin spoke about the Soviet proposal on the prohibition of atomic weapons, he still maintained the attitude I have mentioned, and he said in a wordy manner that if we first discuss the issue of atomic weapons, then the topic of our argument on both sides would be extremely simple. Mr. Bevin also mentioned, as I said at the Paris session of the United Nations General Assembly, that the whole issue ultimately comes down to a matter of trust.

Thus, Mr. Bevin reminded us of his speech at the Paris conference in 1948. But what he said then, in summary, was just one vague sentence: "Only a sense of security and trust can lead to disarmament." Obviously, this sentence was hastily proposed because only a sense of security cannot lead to disarmament. If we recall what Mr. Bevin's predecessor, Mr. Henderson, said: it is disarmament that can lead to a sense of security, then this point becomes clearer. Henderson's statement is more correct. I believe that his statement is correct.

But we can still ask Mr. Bevin and those who think like him: what is it that prevents this sense of security and trust from being produced? If Bevin says: that is simple, what is needed is a sense of trust, then I would ask what is hindering this sense of trust? And—my second question is—how can this feeling finally become as strong as needed, at least strong enough for the British government to advocate disarmament and the prohibition of atomic bombs?

Regarding this, Mr. Bevin—obviously addressing my country's delegation—declared: "Do not close the doors and windows, and do not lower the curtains, otherwise it will be impossible to see inside through the doors and windows," he said: "because in this case 'it will be impossible to build a solid foundation for inspiring trust.'" If we apply this metaphor to actual problems—which of course is what interests us the most—I think it is more interesting than anything else—to say: "Open the doors and windows, lift the curtains, so that one can see inside through the doors and windows," when applied to the prohibition of atomic bombs, it means: to establish an international control organization that can see, hear, feel, and touch the work being done to achieve the prohibition of atomic bombs—perhaps one day we will declare the prohibition of atomic bombs here unanimously. I wish for such a day!

This means: the problem is related to the organization of an international control organization, its powers, and its control authority. If this task is completed, then it is obvious that, as Bevin said, we can talk about a solid foundation for inspiring trust, and trust will be inspired.

Three years ago, the Soviet Union proposed a clear proposal
On the control and supervision of atomic energy
Well, let us accept this approach to the problem. Then what is the truth in this regard? That is, in organizing control so that one can say: "the doors are open, the windows are open, the curtains are rolled up, then observe, feel, think, and trust," what is the truth in this regard?

It is necessary to mention the history of this issue—at least briefly—and I must mention it.

As early as three years ago—June 11, 1947—the Soviet Union submitted a document to the Atomic Energy Commission, clearly stating that control and supervision measures must be taken, and clearly stating what measures should be taken. The document also pointed out: the execution of any supervision actions decided by the Atomic Energy Commission is possible. According to our proposal, in supervising atomic energy enterprises, the international control organization should take the following actions:

(1) Investigate and inspect the work of enterprises obtaining atomic raw materials and atomic energy, and review the archives of these enterprises. This will be the first right of international supervision, which will be carried out under the guidance of the international control organization, of course, without any relationship with the government of any country that has signed this convention.

(2) Investigate the existing storage of atomic raw materials, materials, and semi-finished products.

(3) Investigate production activities within the scope necessary for controlling the use of atomic materials and atomic energy.

(4) Supervise the implementation of technical rules for the use of enterprises regulated by the control convention, and formulate technical control rules that these enterprises must comply with.

(5) Collect and compile records of the procurement of atomic raw materials, the production of atomic materials and atomic energy, etc.

All of this was clearly written in the document of June 11, 1947. Not only that, this document proposed and answered a question: what if this convention is violated? How to deal with such a violation of the convention? The Soviet Union's answer to this question is: if there is a suspicion that the convention prohibiting the use of atomic weapons is violated, the supervisory organization, which operates under the guidance of the international control organization, can conduct special investigations. If there is a suspicion that a violation of the atomic energy production convention has occurred in a certain place or country, then this committee has the full right to conduct a special investigation. In addition, as later explained in response to the special inquiry of the British representative, Mr. Joad, on August 11, 1947, it is said here: such an investigation will be conducted by the international control organization based on the opinion of the Atomic Energy Commission, and the decision of this commission will not be based on unanimity, but on a majority vote, a simple majority, not on the principle of unanimity.

Therefore, the international control organization, if necessary, has the full power to conduct any investigation; such suspicion may be generated based on reports received by the control organization, or it may be generated by the international control organization itself. This was also clearly stated in our documents.

If there are many suspicions of violations of the convention, this document of June 11, 1947, has a specific provision: the supervisory organization can "make recommendations to the Security Council on measures to prevent and stop violations of the convention on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the control of atomic energy."

Critics of us demand every opportunity to supervise the situation in atomic enterprises. However, the document I just read proves: the proposal submitted to the Atomic Energy Commission as early as three years ago clearly stated that the international control organization has the right to send supervisors to places where there is such a suspicion, and to conduct thorough and careful investigations based on the decision of the international control organization.

In addition to these, I want to say: these documents indicate that the international control organization has the right to do the following:

1. Enter any enterprise that refines, manufactures, or stores atomic raw materials and materials, and produces atomic energy.

2. Understand the production activities of various atomic energy enterprises within the scope necessary for controlling the use of atomic materials and atomic energy.

3. Measure, investigate, and analyze various atomic raw materials, atomic materials, and semi-finished products.

4. Request various information and reports from the government of any country about the activities of atomic energy enterprises and review them.

All that I have repeated here is clearly, clearly, and explicitly written in the document submitted by our government on June 11, 1947, and in the official letter sent by the Soviet representative to the Atomic Energy Commission on September 5 of the same year, which is a response to the questions or inquiries raised by the then permanent representative of the Atomic Energy Commission, Mr. Joad, on August 11, 1947. The fact is, what Bevin demands from us—to provide room for supervision—is already there: the doors are open, the windows are open, the curtains are rolled up, and anyone who wants to look inside through the windows, doors, and rolled-up curtains only needs to remove the things that block their own eyes, and they have at least a basic sense of decency— I do not say trust, I only say decency.

The Acheson-Baruch-Lilienthal Plan
Opposing the implementation of any restrictions on the production of atomic bombs
In short, all these facts, and other things, all the talk of lack of trust, suggestions, and declarations, as well as some things that need to be proven, I think that any person without prejudice and with reason can only regard them as empty words. Those who use these empty words are trying to use them to cover up the fact that they do not actually want to conclude any agreement to establish true international control over atomic energy, and they do not want to do so not because they want to strengthen peace and cooperation. Despite the fact that we have pointed out various facts, the same speeches about trust and distrust continue to be made, and the same criticisms are made about the Soviet control plan, which are completely unfounded. However, the Soviet international control plan—whose central feature is supervision—has fully met this task. Even a staunch enemy of the Soviet Union like the British MP Mr. Blackborne had to admit this. In his speech in the House of Commons on this issue in March 1950, he personally said: "You know, gentlemen, I, Blackborne, am a staunch anti-Soviet MP in the House of Commons." And this staunch anti-Soviet MP in the British Parliament said that the Soviet Union (I am quoting a published speech, I have the original English text here) "has given much more cooperation in the field of atomic energy than most people obviously imagine." Regardless of his political views, Blackborne talked about the Soviet proposal of June 11, 1947, and he was quite honest and brave, saying: the Soviet proposal also includes what he called the provision of inspections without prior notification. In other words, Blackborne's meaning is: if any country provides sufficient reasons according to the Soviet proposal, international inspectors can go to inspect factories without prior special notification.

Our plan has been positively evaluated by Blackborne—Blackborne is our political opponent, but he is obviously a person who understands the disaster that an atomic war or hydrogen war will bring, and what impact this will have on all mankind (regardless of their political views, regardless of their political or religious beliefs, regardless of whether they exist in this country or that country, the political and social systems). Therefore, what is opposing our plan? It is the infamous Acheson, Baruch, Lilienthal plan, whose actual purpose has been explained by the famous British physicist Professor Bernal. In an article published in a British magazine, Bernal said: the reason why the United States and Britain insist on this plan is only to use this plan as a tool to prevent the implementation of any restrictions on the production of atomic bombs.

We have quoted documents such as the official letter of the American Atomic Energy Commission in the previous meeting, which shows that the so-called international control plan drafted by Acheson, Baruch, and Lilienthal will not stop the production of atomic weapons.

As for the control to be established according to the so-called phased (i.e., phased) system stipulated in the American plan—you all remember and know this—this control, as Professor Bernal said, cannot but hinder the implementation of plans to apply atomic energy to peaceful purposes, especially for countries that need to use atomic energy to achieve their economic and industrial peaceful construction goals—such as the Soviet Union. In this regard, we must remember: the United States does not intend to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes at all, because it has other energy sources—such as coal, oil, and wood, which, with the current fuel supply methods of the United States, are sufficient to supply all its industrial enterprises, sufficient to make it gain huge profits. However, if it is reorganized on a new basis to apply atomic energy to peaceful purposes, this will require a large amount of new investment, resulting in a reduction in income and profits; this is not in line with the interests of enterprises organized on a capitalist basis.

Of course, I will leave this issue to be discussed in more detail when the United Nations General Assembly begins to discuss the atomic issue. Now I think I only need to mention the things I have reported to the committee here to clarify the positions of the countries on this important issue, and to mention again, when we express our desire to destroy atomic weapons in our declaration, or at least declare that we have the general determination and will to declare the government that first uses such weapons as war criminals, what we really think.

The Anglo-American ruling clique is full of war conspiracies
Opposing the Soviet disarmament proposals with various reasons
As for our proposal to reduce armaments and troops by one-third, we have heard opposition in the general debate of this session and in previous sessions, but the Soviet delegation believes that these oppositions are not serious.

It is said—one of the most important oppositions—that such a reduction will deliberately put countries with different war potentials in an unequal position, and it is said: before starting to reduce armaments by one-third, at least more or less equalize the troops, so that there will be no advantage for one side in terms of troops, and in this regard, of course, the Soviet Union immediately attracts attention.

It is also said that under current conditions, such a reduction in armaments will only be effective for countries with less war potential, while it will have no effect on countries with large war potential.

Mr. Bevin tried to ridicule this point, saying that if this proposal is accepted, it will be like high talk of peace appeals and peace movements, actually establishing some propaganda barriers to weaken the victims before launching an attack.

If we analyze Mr. Bevin's arguments, what conclusion will we reach? The conclusion is: the Soviet proposal to reduce armaments by one-third is an attempt to weaken the victims it will attack in the future. But given the entire policy I have talked about here, what can you base this assumption on? Except for fabricating some kind of Soviet "imperialism," some "red imperialism," etc., you really have no way to oppose it. And this is happening at a time when the countries that have large numbers of troops stationed abroad and are waging wars against the peoples of various countries—Malaya, Vietnam, and Korea—are you, not us, and against China, you are preparing to make trouble there, intending to seize China's Taiwan under the guise of establishing a United Nations trusteeship, and to at least seize a part of the territory of the Chinese people that cannot be transferred.

This is what is used as evidence of a peace policy. But the country that is truly engaged in peace construction is ours, where there is not the slightest sign of warlike atmosphere or war preparation. Dear critics, at least you should read the New York Times correspondent Shalispere's Moscow dispatch, which talks about the fiery construction of Moscow and the Soviet Union, where huge hydroelectric power stations are being built, and its generating capacity exceeds the world's most powerful hydroelectric power station! But in the United States, the entire ruling class's life is permeated with a warlike atmosphere, full of war conspiracies, and has actually fallen into war madness.

Even on this point of argument, Bevin did not show any originality—or: true insight. He only showed some originality in his second point of argument. You may remember that Bevin said in the General Assembly: before reducing the armed forces, the Fifth Column must be driven out of Britain and other so-called Western "free" countries. From his words, it seems that Britain's army cannot be reduced because it is used for domestic purposes, not to defend the borders.

Therefore, I feel that even Bevin's only original argument is unrelated to our issue. We propose that the five powers first reduce armaments and armed forces, and then other steps can and should be taken in the same direction.

I must add that we have made a slight revision to our declaration—which was then distributed as a document of this committee. This is: the reduction of armaments by one-third is not as originally stated in 1950, but in 1950-1951.

Therefore, we believe that all the talk about war potential is groundless and hypocritical, and if we also consider the essence of the problem, it is even more so. What is the situation regarding the war potential of these five—at least—permanent members of the Security Council? I ask you to note the article by the famous military expert Powell recently published in the New York Times Magazine. In this article, the author lists a list of American armed forces, clearly showing the war potential of the United States. This article shows: the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty do not underestimate the level of war potential of the member countries of this bloc, let alone, they have always emphasized the superiority of this bloc, especially in the field of atomic weapons.

However, in any case, the fact is: although the materials listed in the aforementioned article show that some of these countries have reached a very high level of war potential, the countries of this bloc are still engaged in a mad arms race, and huge sums of money are allocated for military purposes.

Just in the United States, in the fiscal year 1949-1950, more than 130 billion dollars were allocated for war purposes, while in the pre-war year of 1938-1939, only more than 10 billion dollars were allocated, so this allocation is more than twelve times that of the previous one. In the fiscal year 1950-1951, the United States plans to spend about 500 billion dollars, which is almost fifty times more than the expenditure in 1938-1939. At the same time, the United States also plans to increase its army, navy, and air force from 1.5 million to 3 million. This was said by the American President Truman on September 1, when he also warned that if necessary, the number of troops would be further increased.

Everyone knows that the United States currently maintains tens of thousands of soldiers abroad who are separated from their families and peaceful production and are engaged in various kinds of war adventures. Everyone knows that the United States has hundreds of air bases scattered all over the world. Everyone knows that the United States is intensifying the mobilization of strategic materials, resources, and supplies and is madly engaged in rearmament.

Some powerful leaders of the United States, like the American Vice President Barkley, have publicly declared that the United States must maintain armed forces in various parts of the world, and said that the United States "may have to occupy several countries before the end of the cold war."

This war fever is very beneficial to the American monopolies, which make huge profits from military orders. Available materials show that the profits of the largest 450 monopolies in the United States in the second quarter of this year are 43% higher than in the second quarter of last year.

As for the attitude of the American ruling class towards solving the atomic issue, Mr. Acheson mentioned this in his opening speech, and in this regard, the interests of the monopolies also dominate everything, leading their efforts to the expansion of the atomic industry and constantly seeking new appropriations to manufacture atomic weapons and invent hydrogen bombs. To make this war industry sector a sector with tens of billions of capital, and as expressed in a U.S. magazine, to make it the largest new industry in the United States, to make this sector a truly huge "enterprise," all means are used. Even now, the investment in the production of atomic weapons has almost reached 50 billion, and the annual expenditure for hydrogen bomb work has exceeded 10 billion, which is not accidental.

All of this is related to the enrichment of the atomic trusts, merchants supplying military equipment and atomic industry materials, and can be explained by the fact that the American ruling class can now be said to have been driven mad by war, and is in a state of complete war delirium and war madness. At the same time, those countries that spend less on the military compared to previous years are accused of plotting against peace, while those countries that spend tens of billions of dollars on the military, more than fifty times the pre-war years, seem to be wholeheartedly strengthening peace. No one will agree with this strange logic!

In the United States, no one is interested in using atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

Professor Bernal pointed out in his interesting article "Atoms—For War or Peace?" that, except for a few centimeters of tracer left for medical and biological purposes, the United States actually has no atomic energy used for peace.

The focus of the American plan on so-called international control for war needs is to cater to the main trend in American foreign policy. This focus also explains why the Baruch-Lilienthal plan did not consider the special economic difficulties and economic development of individual countries. This is one of the sources of the differences in the positions of the United States and the Soviet Union on the atomic issue.

The proposal to transfer the ownership of atomic enterprises to the so-called international control organization is one of the main obstacles that prevent reaching an agreement on international control to prohibit the use of atomic energy for war purposes. Although the Acheson-Baruch-Lilienthal plan (which is the basis of the so-called American international control plan) is completely unacceptable, the United States and Britain obviously do not want to modify it. Mr. Acheson said in the General Assembly that the United States will continue to carefully study all proposals, but this statement has no significant meaning because Acheson has a reservation. He said that what is referred to here are proposals that, according to him, will be equally effective or more effective in achieving this goal. In other words, the Acheson-Baruch-Lilienthal plan is considered the most effective method to solve the problem of the use of atomic energy.

The Soviet Union proposes to pass a declaration on atomic weapons
This is the voice of the conscience of the people of the world
The Soviet government has repeatedly made efforts and will continue to make efforts in the future to make every necessary effort to solve this atomic issue, achieve the prohibition of atomic weapons, and establish a truly effective international control to ensure that there will be no violations or evasions of this prohibition.

The Soviet delegation proposes to pass a declaration on atomic weapons as the first step towards this goal. The declaration states: "Considering that the use of atomic weapons as weapons of aggression and mass destruction of mankind is contrary to conscience and national honor, and is inconsistent with the status of members of the United Nations Organization, the General Assembly hereby declares the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and establishes strict international control to ensure that this prohibition is strictly and unconditionally implemented."

I emphasize: this declaration declares, expresses the will and determination, and in fact, this declaration will have moral significance.

At the same time, the General Assembly declares—I want to emphasize the word "declares"—"the government that first uses atomic weapons or any other weapons of mass destruction against any country is guilty of violating humanity and is regarded as a war criminal."

The people of all countries in the world demand this. Fifty million people have signed this demand, and despite the fact that in some countries, peace fighters are subjected to terror and intimidation, the ranks of peace fighters continue to grow. In this army, there are many world-renowned figures: famous scientists, writers, artists, many parliamentarians and legislative assembly members of various countries, famous social figures and political leaders, thousands of priests of various religious beliefs, farmers, workers, intellectuals.

Every day, more and more selfless peace fighters and fighters for peace emerge from all classes and strata of society.

We cannot help but notice the words of an American scientist—a nuclear physicist. He said: "The future does not belong to the country that produces more atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs than other countries. The future belongs to the country that first uses atomic energy for the peaceful progress of its people." This professor said: "I believe that the Soviet people are already doing this. If the United States does not try to reach the same level, our country's political prestige in the world will be reduced to nothing."

I also cannot help but mention the letter to the United Nations from the French intelligentsia protesting the use of atomic bombs (this letter was obviously not distributed in time, at least not according to the document distribution; I would like to ask the chairman to pay attention to distributing this letter to the delegations of the countries in this committee). Among the signatories of this letter, we see outstanding French scientists, Nobel Prize winners Joliot-Curie, Academician Morgan of the French Academy of Sciences, famous professors of the Sorbonne University, and many other very famous representatives of the French intelligentsia.

Therefore, I say, our proposal to declare atomic bombs as prohibited weapons and declare the government that first uses this weapon as war criminals is the voice of the conscience of the people of the world who have signed the Stockholm Declaration with 50 million signatures. Some people feel uncomfortable when talking about this issue, but this declaration exists, and it has already recorded the name of Stockholm in world history with indelible characters.

This proposal is of great significance for eliminating the threat of war and strengthening the cause of peace.

The Soviet government reaffirms its firm determination to unconditionally prohibit atomic weapons. The Soviet government has always insisted, and now still insists on this demand: the Soviet government has always insisted, and now still insists on the implementation of strict and effective international control to prevent the use of atomic energy for war purposes. We now insist, we have always insisted, and we will continue to insist on this position because we firmly believe that the number of people supporting this proposal will increase day by day, because the ranks of peace advocates are growing and will continue to grow, because the people of the world yearn for peace and abhor war.

The United States uses new war propaganda to poison the people
The Soviet Union firmly advocates stopping this propaganda
The enemies of peace are widely using newspapers, radio, and films to promote new wars, systematically poisoning the minds of the masses with this propaganda. Those who truly want peace cannot tolerate this disgraceful phenomenon. We cannot consider using the excuse of so-called freedom of speech and press to oppose the prohibition of new war propaganda. All these excuses we must resolutely refute because they are groundless. However, until today, this propaganda continues to spread; in some countries, this propaganda is even increasing in scale and scope.

For example, we cannot ignore the words of new war instigators like the U.S. Secretary of the Navy, Matthews, who said: for the sake of peace, we must be prepared to pay any price for cooperation, even if this price includes war, we are not afraid. I believe that this shameless statement is not worth discussing.

No one can remain silent about the words of British MP White, who advocates "putting an end to the hypocritical nonsense about the prohibition of atomic bombs once and for all"; nor can one ignore the words of the former U.S. Secretary of Defense, Johnson, who has repeatedly appeared as an instigator of the arms race, especially the manufacture of atomic weapons and biological weapons; nor can one ignore the words of the Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Bradley, who systematically and wantonly slanders the Soviet Union in his public speeches, inciting an arms race and preparing for a new war.

We must also mention MacArthur's letter to the "American Veterans of Foreign Wars," which contains an open plan to plunder Taiwan and the entire Pacific, calling Taiwan an "unsinkable aircraft carrier" and a submarine base, and the Pacific a "broad trench," a "shield to protect the entire American continent."

The Soviet government believes that the shameless propaganda for new wars, the slanderous incitement against other countries, and the seizure of their territories, the violation of their territorial sovereignty and political independence, are incompatible with the principles, purposes, and tasks of the United Nations, and it believes that the duty of the General Assembly is to use its influence to stop this propaganda. If we consider that war propaganda has been condemned by a resolution of the General Assembly, then this is even more the duty of the General Assembly. This resolution proposes that all governments of the United Nations member states take measures to encourage peaceful propaganda to strengthen and develop friendly relations among all peoples.

At this point, I cannot help but recall Dulles' statement on May 16, 1950, at the International Building in New York. Dulles said at that time: "We no longer need international committees that merely engage in high talk. Such committees have become new obstacles on the road to action." This is a direct reference to the United Nations, because from his statement, it is directly clear that the United Nations is hindering Dulles and his accomplices from taking action in the direction I have mentioned—the direction of implementing American aggressive foreign policy. Dulles said, "In the military field, we need the highest allied command." This is the wish of this "peace-loving" person, who is also called the "most gentle Christian."

In previous sessions of the General Assembly, we have already mentioned the names of some new war instigators, such as Churchill, who is still unrepentant; and Vanstittard, who is still working hard to continue his vicious work of promoting new wars, threatening and intimidating with all kinds of terrible things, which, according to him, are being prepared behind the "Iron Curtain," which does not exist, just as these terrible things do not exist.

The Soviet proposal is in the interests of all mankind
Dealing a decisive blow to all plots of aggression
Our draft declaration is based on the necessity of strengthening peace, and it also takes into account the special responsibilities of the permanent members of the Security Council, the main responsibilities of the Security Council, and the responsibilities of all member states in our organization, because these responsibilities are inseparable.

Our declaration proposes that the General Assembly appeal to the aforementioned five powers to unite in the efforts for peace and conclude a pact to strengthen peace among them.

We said this last year, and we say it now, because the vital interests of all mankind require this.

Mr. Chairman, gentlemen, there is no need to emphasize the special importance of this proposal. The adoption of this proposal will deal a decisive blow to all plots of aggression, to all plans of the manufacturers of new wars, and will make a great contribution to strengthening peace and world security.

This is what the Soviet delegation asks all other delegations to pay attention to.

### 十月二十三日在联合国大会政治委员会上  维辛斯基关于苏联和平提案演说全文

　　十月二十三日在联合国大会政治委员会上
    维辛斯基关于苏联和平提案演说全文
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约二十五日电：维辛斯基本年十月二十三日在政治委员会上的演说，全文如下：
    九月二十日，苏联代表团向联合国大会提出其旨在制止新战争威胁及加强各国和平与安全的建议。
    苏联代表团在其向大会发表的声明中已经列举促成苏联政府建议联合国大会第五届会议讨论这一问题，并据此通过苏联代表团提出之宣言草案的一些基本动机。我们当时也强调指出，如果联大通过这一号召为反对新战争威胁、争取各国和平与安全而坚决大力斗争的宣言，会有多么巨大的意义。
    在目前的国际形势下，通过这一宣言具有特别意义；目前，战争正在朝鲜及远东其他地方进行，威胁着全人类的切身利益与福祉的新战争煽动者继续不停地进行他们的阴谋。
    另一方面，亿万劳动人民却以空前未有的力量发出抗议准备新战争的强有力的呼声，要求各国政府采取坚决的、信守不渝的措施，来加强和平、制止新战争威胁，保证各国人民的安全。
    苏联代表团认为，为保卫和平坚持不渝地完成联合国大会面临的任务，过去从来没有像现在这样，对联合国的活动具有非常的重要性。苏联代表团所提出的各项建议，其目的即在实现我们宪章中论述联合国的宗旨与原则的一章中已经规定和列举的这些目的。这一为和平斗争的思想在我们整个宣言草案中都很突出。宣言的序言强调指出，现在正在朝鲜及太平洋其他地区发展着的事件以新的力量证实：五强大国——负有维持国际和平之特殊责任的安全理事会常任理事国——的共同和平努力，对各国和平与安全的事业，具有非常的重要性和迫切性。
    无需强调，安理会常任理事国谋取和平的努力是和一切其他爱好和平的国家——中小国家——的努力极其密切地结合起来的，是和一切努力避免为人民带来不可言状的忧患与苦难的战争灾祸的人们，以及一切努力促进各国友好关系之发展及各国解决国际问题之合作、从而保持并加强世界和平的人们的努力，极其密切地结合起来的。
    苏联始终一贯坚决遵循和平政策
    为巩固国际合作进行了不屈斗争
    尽管在走向加强各国和平与合作的道路上遇到许多障碍，苏联仍坚持不渝地、坚定地遵循这一道路，苏联知道而且深信，这充分地符合苏联人民及一切其他爱好和平的民族的希望和意愿；这符合全体人类的利益。
    苏维埃国家及其外交政策的历史上的许多事实与文件证明，苏联政府为争取和平与巩固国际合作坚决地进行了不屈不挠的斗争。这些事实证明了苏维埃政府自从伟大的十月革命初期以来就为了达到和平的目标并为社会主义社会、工农的社会主义国家创造条件而始终在进行惊人的努力，表现了无穷的主动性。从事于和平建设劳动的苏联人民没有任何好战的意图和战争计划。苏联人民痛恨战争，他们正作极大的努力，要制止新战争的威胁并保证我们的人民为胜利地完成社会主义建设而迫切需要的和平与安全。苏联和伟大的苏联人民的一切创造力量都是为了要达到和平的目标。苏联的科学和技术是为和平服务的，为和平建设劳动服务的。整个的苏联工业、整个的苏联国民经济都朝着同一方向发展。
    和平的思想与和平创造性的努力渗透了苏联的全部生活，无论战争贩子们说些什么，无论他们如何费劲地设法用对苏联的卑鄙诽谤来欺骗人民，我们相信，在世界上任何地方，没有一个正直的人会相信什么苏联对其他国家，对其他民族有战争计划的诽谤谰言。
    这些不正直的人们为了本身自私的利益，企图通过散布各种各样中伤社会主义国度的恶意捏造与诽谤谎言来破坏各国人民对苏联和平政策的信任，可是不论他们进行什么样的企图，他们都无法从全世界亿万普通人民的心中泯除这样坚定的信念：正是苏联是和平的堡垒，是和平的坚强而且忠诚的捍卫者；苏联——正如苏联政府的元首斯大林所说——能够遵循并且实际上也正在遵循和平政策，不是虚伪地，而是诚恳而公开地、坚决而始终一贯地遵循和平政策。
    任何人企图在这问题上欺骗老实的人民是注定要失败的，因为任何人都无法靠歇斯底里的叫嚣，靠什么苏联认为社会主义国家与资本主义国家不可能和平共存，以及什么苏联并不努力与其他国家特别是属于不同的社会制度与政治制度的国家谋取合作与保持友好关系等谰言，来掩饰他们对苏联的敌意阴谋。
    所有这种敌视苏联的阴谋都被许多令人信服的事实所驳倒了，都被苏维埃国家的三十余年历史、苏联的和平外交政策的全部方针与内容所驳倒了。
    然而时常在国际性会议上而且特别是在联合国中提出的问题，究竟怎样呢？这问题便是关于苏联——社会主义国家与资本主义国家之间和平共存与合作的可能性问题。在大会历届会议中，这个问题已经引起许多注意，而且经过详尽的讨论，虽然有某些代表团歪曲历史事实，曲解这一问题。不过这个问题似乎仍没有讨论透彻，因为在本届会议中某些代表团曾经企图重提这个问题。虽然我不喜欢多话，然而我仍然认为有必要也来讨论一下这个问题，并且追述若干重要事实来充分说明这个问题。
    斯大林在一九二七年就曾经指出
    两个制度的协议是可能而合宜的
    事实是这样的：
    约·维·斯大林在一九二七年接见第一个美国劳工代表团时曾指出：两个相反的制度——资本主义制度与社会主义制度——的存在并不能排除苏联和资本主义国家在工业方面、商业方面、在外交关系方面取得协议的可能。
    在这次会晤中，约·维·斯大林说：“我认为这样的协议在和平发展的情况下是可能的而且是合宜的。进出口是这种协议的最适宜的场所。我们需要机器、原料（例如原棉）、半制品（金属等），而资本家则需要这一类货物的市场。这就为协议提供了基础。资本家需要石油、木材、谷物等产品，而我们则需要这些货物的市场。这也为协议提供了基础。我们需要信用贷款，资本家则需要因信用贷款而取得优厚的利息。这又是一个可以令人取得协议的、在信用贷款方面的基础。尽人皆知：苏联机关付款是最守时的”。
    从那时到现在，时间已经不算短了；我们的需要在这一段时期中也已有改变。有许多东西我们已不再需要通过商业机关从资本主义国家取得了，但是即使到现在，贸易关系问题也还没有失去其力量，也还没有丧失它在巩固国际关系方面的意义。我之所以要追述一九二七年苏联政府元首向美国劳工代表团所说的这些话，主要的是为了要表明：只要具有善意，并诚心为真正的合作而努力，建立并加强国际关系从而有助于加强国际和平与安全是有许多可能性的。
    约·维·斯大林在这次会晤中强调：苏联实行着和平政策，并且愿意和资本主义国家签订互不侵犯条约，愿意和它们缔结关于裁军等问题方面的协定。斯大林在那次和美国代表团的会晤中，在追述了当时业已和其他国家缔结的协定以后曾宣布：我们希望这些协定多少有些持久性，但是他警告说：“这当然不仅取决于我们，而且也取决于对方”。
    二十年代以来苏联致力加强和平
    为争取集体安全展开了积极斗争
    尽管某些国家，例如美利坚合众国，那时以及在后来十六年中不承认苏联，并且用各种方法反对这种承认，反对美国舆论及其他资本主义国家进步人士关于美国应放弃对年青苏维埃国家实行抵制的荒谬政策的要求，苏联仍试图同别的甚至有不同社会、经济及政治制度的国家进行和平的合作，并得以与若干国家改进了关系，与它们缔结了若干关于贸易、技术援助等方面的条约。
    恰在此时，尽管苏联遭受若干资本主义国家和美利坚合众国之类的大国的抵制，苏联仍参加了凯洛格公约，并按照此公约和其他国家签订了议定书，并为争取集体安全展开了积极的斗争。自二十年代开始，苏联积极参加了当时在国际联盟主持下所举行的若干会议；不是别人，而正是苏联政府，在一九三三年二月建议通过关于侵略及侵略者的定义。虽然许多国家支持这个提案，而且由十七国代表组成的安全委员会的多数也在大体上通过了这个提案，但是它却被那时按照英法政府代表指示行事的会议所拒绝了。
    然而苏联与其西方及南方的多数邻国（包括芬兰、波兰）以及所谓小协约国的国家，缔结了关于侵略者的定义的公约。同时，并与同一样一些邻国及法国和意大利等缔结了不侵犯公约。
    国际联盟的大多数国家反对苏联当时正在大力争取的国际政策的这一方向，并否决了苏联的和平建议。苏联克服所有这些阻碍，遵行这条加强和平的道路，凭它自己的倡议并支持若干其他国家的倡议，缔结了条约和协定，这些条约和协定自然不是具文，而是实际的行动。这正是有些代表们过低估计了的事情，他们用陈词滥调来在回答我们提出的关于和平的建议和关于采取措施加强和平的建议。他们说：“不要仅用言语而要用行动来证明你们是真正准备履行这些措施的”。他们是提出这些问题来逃避支持苏联建议的必要性，来在一种借口下（像我刚才说过的，他们说：这些都是空话，你们要以行动表明你们的话和建议将如何付诸实行）击败苏联的这些建议；难道我刚才谈到的这些事实还没有雄辩地驳倒他们想借此干出的任何企图吗？
    我已经列举了一些事实，这些事实显示：苏联的话和建议是如何始终不变地付诸实行和实现了，只要这些建议得到其他代表团，其他国家的即使是一点点的支持的话，只要这些国家表示一点点愿与苏联、与苏联政府在某些实实在在的问题上达成协议的愿望的话。
    这就是那时候苏联的和平外交政策。第二次世界大战前几年和战后的几年也提供了许多例证。这个时候，由于苏联的倡议和努力，苏联并非仅是建议，而且与许多国家建立了友好认真的关系与联系。
    苏联领袖坚信两个制度可以共存
    苏美间争执的和平解决绝对必要
    苏维埃国家的领袖们不只一次地指出，苏联的外交政策产自这样的信念，即社会主义与资本主义制度的长期共存是不可避免的而且是可能的。苏联认为苏联与那些准备以相互关切的精神来行动与愿意诚恳地履行它们所承担的国际义务的政府和平合作是充分可行的而且是可能的。
    一九四六年九月，星期日泰晤士报驻莫斯科记者Ａ·渥尔斯曾问苏联部长会议主席约瑟夫·斯大林：随着苏联进一步迈向共产主义，苏联与外面世界的和平合作的可能性是不是不会减少，苏联政府的元首约瑟夫·斯大林当时答道：
    “我毫不怀疑，和平合作的可能性将不但不会减少而且甚至可能增加。”
    也是在一九四六年，伊里奥特·罗斯福曾问约瑟夫·斯大林：你相信美国有可能与苏联那样共产主义形式的政府和平共存而且双方都不企图干涉对方的内政呢？
    约瑟夫·斯大林当时回答道：“我当然相信。这不仅是可能的。这也是明智的并且是完全可以实现的。在战争最艰苦的时候，在政府形式的不同并没有曾妨碍我国两国家联合起来和战胜我们的敌人。那么要在和平时期继续这种关系就是更加可能的了。”
    约瑟夫·斯大林在一九四八年五月着重地说：苏联政府认为：“尽管经济制度与意识形态上有区别，可是为了普遍和平的利益，这些制度的共存以及苏联和美国之间争执的和平解决不仅是可能的，而且是绝对必要的。”
    大家也都知道，约瑟夫·斯大林对于国际新闻社欧洲分社社长史密斯的问题所作的具有历史性的答复，当时，这位苏联政府的元首曾说：“自然，苏联政府是可以在采取为了实现这个和平公约的措施上，并在逐渐实行裁军上，与美利坚合众国政府合作的。”
    伟大的苏联领袖这几句话决定了苏联外交政策的整个路线，它是坚持不渝地奉行符合苏联人民与一切爱好和平民族的基本利益的目的。
    在我看来，这些事实足以使毁谤得最后鸦雀无声——所有那些把散播卑污谰言、诬蔑苏联及其外交政策、诬蔑其诚意及其真正愿为一切爱好和平的民族的利益而合作之心意，当做自己的职业的毁谤家。
    美英集团实行武力恫吓外交政策
    迷信实力是解决世界问题的条件
    美利坚合众国的外交政策是怎样呢？事实证明，美国的外交政策完全不同。美国的外交也是另外一种。国务院的首长在他二月十六日的演说中依据“总体战”称这种外交为“总体外交”，这一个定义充分雄辩地说明美国外交实际是什么东西。为了使人在这一方面无所怀疑，艾奇逊先生在同一演说中强调说，美国领袖反对在例如对苏联的关系上有善意的容忍，并说只有创造有实力的局势才能对付苏联。
    几天以后，在另一场合，艾奇逊先生在谈到美苏关系时重申这个思想，这一次并加以详细的阐释。他在谈论美国外交政策时说道，我们的基本政策在于创造那种会使可能的协议的范围扩大的局势，这就是说，创造实力以代替现在在许多地方存在的孱弱……。他继续说，西欧经济复兴计划（按即马歇尔计划）的整个目的在于创造实力以代替孱弱……，他又说，这就是军事援助的目的，第四点计划的目的。
    因此，如果我们对艾奇逊先生的这些言论加以分析（而我仅仅是援引了他许多言论中的一些言论，它们也许不够有力，但在我看来却是十分明白的一些言论），那么就可以看出，美国国务院（它自然对美国外交政策负主要责任，和美国其他也对这一政策负有责任的高级领袖一样），认为未决的外交政策问题的解决，就是说认为国务院的外交政策，只是一种要以这样坚固的论据，如武装部队、如陆军、如海军、如空军为后盾而用武力、压力、命令来实施的政策。美国政治领袖们在他们的一切言论中有计划地加以强调的——好像是炫耀一样，正是美国政府对外政治活动中的武力，所具有的重要性。这提供了充分的根据来说，武力构成整个美英集团外交政策的基础。我是用的美英集团，但我了解，在这一事件上的决定作用仍属于美利坚合众国，更不要提某些其他国家了。这些国家，我很遗憾地说，在经济上是大大依赖美国的。不仅仅美国领袖与重要官员们公然说武力是调节国际关系的主要工具与武器，而且其他国家的部长们也重复同样的论调。
    例如，据大不列颠外交大臣贝文先生说，英国的外交政策遵循着同一方针。据纽约时报报道，贝文先生最近说，由于西方国家的实力已有增加，因而有可能经过大国间的直接会谈解决世界问题。
    这意味着什么呢？这就是说，只有当一个人感到可以相信他自己的力量时，他才能与苏联进行谈判。换言之，这就是说，只有当这些打算与苏联谈判如何解决某些国际未决问题的政府武装到牙齿时，才与苏联进行谈判。一个人要与他国进行谈判，而采取这样态度，首先露出戴铠甲的拳头及他为谈判所作的“外交”准备的其他特性，其结果会如何是很明显的。
    根据贝文的说法，实力是解决世界问题的先决条件，这些问题只有在必要时不惜使用武装力量的恫吓下才能解决。这些话表示出美英集团外交政策的真正方向。
    在谈到联合国组织讨论美英集团所提保障和平的联合行动案——我们刚刚审议完毕的议程的第二项——的情形时，贝文先生把事情说成，好像是授权大会支配武装部队，通过与有关各国谈判来促进未决问题的解决；因此，在这个问题上，也是着眼于武力因素，我甚至应该说是恫吓与引起他方恐惧的因素——这是十分明显的。
    无须多说，根据这种原则的政策一般说是莽撞的，不会得到什么收获的，对苏联采取这种政策尤其是如此。
    诸如武力，诸如关于这些谈判的某些特别后果的恫吓之类的论据，对于苏联只能起一种消极的作用。应该选择其他伙伴来进行这样的实验。苏联当然是不适合进行这种实验的。
    侵略集团领袖崇拜毁灭人类武器
    企图用武力来建立对苏联的关系
    贝文先生声明，英国政府仍然相信联合国组织是解决国际争端的工具，认为需要建立北大西洋公约以及其他类似措施来加强其地位，他这么说时更确切地说明了问题的本质。
    这样地提北大西洋公约是很可以说明其特性的，因为北大西洋公约的侵略性质人人都知道得很清楚，不需要特别证明，自然，如果在这方面有人提出任何反对意见的话，我也并不拒绝提出证据来说明这种说法的正确性。
    为了使人彻底明了贝文先生对于苏联的想法，我们必须注意他演说中的一段话。在那一段话中，他表示：西方国家必须强大起来，然后四国会谈才能产生良好的结果。贝文的这种说法吸引了报纸的注意。例如，纽约时报——你们全都知道的报纸——在评述贝文的这句话时追述到（不是偶然地追述）邱吉尔的声明。邱吉尔说：事件进一步的发展要看西方外交如何利用原子弹给予西方的那种邱吉尔所谓的“喘息时间”。该报评述贝文演说称，走向安全的唯一道路在于恢复从前西欧的军事力量。
    利用这种大规模毁灭人类的、惨无人道的武器来取得两次战争之间的“喘息时间”，宣传原子弹是保卫和平的工具而且还将这种非人道的死亡武器描绘成生命的源泉，有什么比这更为可耻的事吗？
    我们很难想像还有什么比这更可耻的作法了。
    英美集团的领袖们宣称：对武力的崇拜、对原子武器的崇拜是美国、英国和其他参加北大西洋公约的国家对外关系的主要推动力，是整个外交政策的主要杠杆和枢轴。
    这些事实说明了美国和它的盟国——英国与法国——的外交政策的本质是什么。
    对于苏联，很明显的，美英阵营的高级政治家们企图用武力来建立对苏联和人民民主国家的关系，他们企图以它们力量的对比——我再说一声，用它们军事力量的对比——来决定与苏联合作的可能性的比例。
    杜鲁门最近的旧金山演说证明：决定美国外交政策的整个路线的正是那个力量，美国总统在这篇演说中企图为目前美国统治集团政策的侵略性路线辩护，把这种路线说成是美国“被迫”采取的路线。于是，他运用了充分的反苏捏造来掩盖这种路线的实际内容与性质；这种路线疯狂地扩充军备与发动新战争，是与他的花言巧语高唱和平的论调完全相矛盾的。
    这篇演说对美国人民的警告也不是偶然的。它警告说：美国人民将来要负担更沉重的军费，美国——如杜鲁门所说——应以更多的资源用于军事目的，而以更少的资源用于消费品。
    这不是别的，而是从希特勒反动阵营里出来的每一个人所熟悉的老调——“大炮先于牛油”。
    大家知道：美国参议院财政委员会通过了一个计划，要把税收总额增加五十亿美元，这将使本年十月一日起，个人所得税平均增加百分之十六，此外其他税收也有增加。
    美英阵营领袖假装愿意与苏合作
    企图掩盖他们从事新战争的准备
    这些事实说明：关于集体安全、和平的愿望——这种和平，艾奇逊先生说，必须是合乎道义的和平，给人民以兄弟般地团结起来的可能性的和平——等等夸夸其谈的话，是一个钱也不值的！很明显的，这些夸夸其谈的话是用来欺骗本国人民和其他国家的人民，使他们看不见美国外交政策的真实本质，美国的外交政策是以使用武力的方法为根据来与其他国家打交道的。
    这些事实充分揭露了美英阵营的许许多多领袖们所发表的他们愿意与苏联合作的声明是何等的假仁假义与虚伪。他们在作这些声明时提出初步的条件，要苏联提供证据以表示它事实上确实施行和平的政策，合作的政策。这一事实就揭穿了这些声明的不严肃性。这种声明不能不认为是企图借此隐蔽他们自己不愿与苏联合作、不愿为了和平与任何人合作；也不能不认为是借此隐蔽他们愿望毫不受阻碍地实施他们的侵略计划与意图，而且这种侵略计划与意图要比已经在世界上许多地方进行的规模还要大。
    这种声明的目的仅仅是为了掩盖他们自己对国际协定的破坏并帮助他们从事新战争的准备。
    一方面，美国、英国、法国以及一些和它们结成紧密政治军事集团的其他国家的负责领袖们毫不在乎地发表一大堆的演说，谈论国际合作的重要性，安全理事会常任理事国意见一致的重要性，协商和协议的必要性，也说到设法消除意见分歧和获致符合联合国宪章的要求和原则的一致同意的决定的必要性，而他们有时甚至按照这种精神通过一些决议案，像几天以前会上讨论所谓“保障和平的联合行动”案时所表现的那样。虽然一方面是这些漂亮的演说、不算坏的提案，例如叙利亚和伊拉克联合提案等等，还有所谓保障和平的联合努力。而另一方面却公开破坏他们以前所缔结的国际协定和国际条约中所规定的义务，与巩固和平的任务不相容的破坏行为。
    美英法对德政策破坏波茨坦协定
    阴谋利用西德军队实现侵略目的
    破坏在极重要的问题上的国际协定的例子，我可以举出美国、英国和法国对德国的政策，和它们彻底破坏它们在波茨坦协定中所担负的义务的事实。我们且来回忆一下杜勒斯在上次会议中说过不止一次的话吧；他说：以后再也不会回到德黑兰、雅尔达和波茨坦了。
    美、英、法三国政府在走上了分裂德国，把德国拉进它们的军事侵略计划中的道路以后，现在正在采取恢复西德陆军和使西德重新军事化的措施，这在今年九月十九日三国外长发表的声明中可以看得很清楚。这个声明极端粗暴地违反和背弃了波茨坦协定；在该协定中，四强都提出保证，决不允许德国重新军事化，决不允许德国重新成为全世界的（首先是欧洲的）恐怖中心，也决不容许它成为德国的复仇分子和支持他们的美、英、法反动集团所梦想的战争温床。
    这几个国家想要携起手来，以便利用德国西部的人力和物力为它们的帝国主义的利益服务，以实现它们的战略计划；在这个计划背后的就是美国统治集团取得世界霸权的野心。它们以结束对德战争状态为借口，竭力制造条件，以便公开把德国西部拉进所谓北大西洋联盟的侵略集团，极力使德国西部完全变成它们在欧洲的侵略性战略计划的工具。
    这就是美、英、法三国政府对德国的政策；刚在布拉格闭幕的苏、波、捷、罗、德、匈、阿、保八国外长会议的声明完全正确地说出了这个政策的特点。
    希特勒的将领哈尔德、古德林、曼陀菲尔之流正在参加恢复德国（西德）陆军的工作，而且准备把这支陆军供美英集团驱使。在德国西部和柏林西区，现在已有四十五万伪装做警察而实际上是军队的士兵，这些军队包括坦克队和炮队。事实上，由前法西斯军官和将领指挥的正规的西德陆军已经恢复，并且正在柏林西区德国西部活动着和扩充着。
    这些事实无可争辩地证明了美、英、法三国政府彻头彻尾地破坏了它们关于成立统一、民主、爱好和平的德国的义务，正如八国外长在布拉格对纽约三国会议将德国西部重新军国主义化的决定所发表的声明中所指出的那样。
    美国和英国的外交政策就是这样，企图利用欧洲的德国西部军队和远东的日本军队来实现侵略目的。
    为了要强行它们的意志，为了要——像他们所幻想的那样——实现这种政策，它们竭力要穷凶极恶地武装起来。若干年来，它们把希望寄托在原子弹上，但是失败了。现在，它们又把希望寄托在氢弹上，但是我们可以说：先生们！这也是要失败的。
    美英企图将联合国拖入军事冒险
    它们的政策与和平任务全不相同
    那么，在这种情况下，联合国组织必须做些什么呢？美国和英国代表企图将联合国拖上去的一条路就是将联合国会员国拖入军事冒险的道路，我们知道，他们有时办到了这一点，例如在朝鲜，在朝鲜事件上，这是一条致联合国组织于死命的道路，这违反了联合国原则和联合国宪章。还有另一条道路，既不伪善也不捏造，而是真心诚意和老老实实地抛弃以军队来恫吓伙伴的好战的计划、威胁和企图；并且要在平等权利和互相尊重的基础上对未解决的问题获致协议。这是一条是在相互都可以接受的原则和条件上达成国际协议的道路。
    人们应该认识到：在各式各样的国际组织的讲台上空谈和平，同时又在幕后，在陆军部和参谋总部里疯狂地准备进攻那些他们声言要与之谈判的国家的计划，这样和平是不可能巩固的。
    我们对于争取和平与加强国际和平合作的道路上的困难并没有闭上眼睛不看。我们知道：这些困难的基本原因就是我刚刚提到的那种重要的情况——某些国家的外交政策方向（而主要就是美国，它领导着某些国家组成的反动集团），它们的政策与和平的任务是毫无相同之处的。
    大家知道，我们视之为和平的重要工具的联合国能够在争取和平的事业中发挥巨大的作用，如果联合国强大得足以抵御与和平及和平政策的趋向不能并容的倾向，如果联合国有力量反对各种各样的冒险计划，它的积极的反对能确使这些计划归于失败，那么联合国就能起这种作用。但是为了要它能发挥这种作用，联合国就必须坚定地站稳脚跟，必须具有足够的权威和影响。然而，削弱这个组织、破坏它所赖以建立的基础却不能使这个组织产生力量；使它无力按照为它订定的法律而行动，也不能使这个组织产生力量，因为这种法律是应作为它行动的指针的，它不能不遵照这些法律而行动。
    那末，我们对于那种现在一贯在进行着的，已经不止是一个月，也许不止一年的对于联合国本身的政策还有什么话好说呢？这种政策的目的就是要违犯宪章，违犯宪章的原则，破坏宪章，以错误的、非法的、不公正的决定来破坏联合国的机构，破坏像安全理事会这样责任最大最为重要的机构。作出这些决定的目的好像就是专为一次又一次地表明完全蔑视国际义务似的。
    这种粗暴地违犯宪章的行动在这里已经成了家常便饭了。在安全理事会辩论美国侵略朝鲜，辩论中华人民共和国在联合国的代表权，和最近在政治委员会辩论所谓保障和平的联合行动案时（其中的丙段和丁段万分粗暴地违犯了宪章，而且与加强联合国的努力不能并容。）都发生过这种事情。如果不加强联合国，那末空说加强和平是没有益处的，因为维护和平是靠着有组织的努力的，而有组织的努力则是某些组织所作出来的；如果这些组织被削弱到等于零的地步，它们所作的任务努力就不会产生任何积极的结果。
    人们应该牢记，对联合国所施的每一打击，就是对和平事业的严重打击，因为联合国的巩固性和力量在加强和平、加强国际合作的斗争中是一个最为重要的因素。
    苏联提出裁军与禁用原子武器案
    反对者以“信任”“保证”为阻挠借口
    让我来紧接着谈谈我们的提案吧。
    在联大这次会议之初，进行一般辩论时，在苏联代表团宣布了它的提案以后，某些代表团就出而反对苏联代表团所提出的“制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全的宣言”。
    这些代表团以他们平时敌视苏联的精神来对待我们关于宣言的提案。这一次，也和以前历届大会的情形一样，他们企图不讨论我们的问题而代之以另外的问题。可以预料，他们也可能在这里作那种打算。他们将企图以所谓“信任”与所谓“保证”的问题来代替我们的问题。
    据说：我们所作的裁减军备三分之一、宣布使用原子弹为犯罪、并且宣布第一个使用这种炸弹的政府为战犯的建议是死的、无效力的，而且，要使它们有效，就需要有保证，为了有效，就需要保证信任这些建议将来真正能够实行。
    这就是说：整个问题被化为说明信任的程度，信任的形式，一句话，就是以信任的问题代替禁止的问题，代替禁止原子弹的问题。然而忘记了：为了要信任，实际的行为是必要的，必要有能够作为这种信任的基础的某些具体措施。保证信任——这是作为接受苏联提案的先决条件而提出的要求。
    我必须说，这是一个久经试验的方法，想以适当的借口来规避讨论我们建议加以讨论并作出决定的那些问题；这种方法已有至少二十五年以上的悠久历史了。这种方法已为国际舞台上许多饱有经验的剑客们使用过很多次，如像张伯伦、汉德逊、庞古、克雷孟梭、白里安这样一些以一个问题代替另一问题的巧妙的大师们。
    三十年以前在国际联盟集团中提出的问题——即这种信任的问题——所以从未得到解决，并不是偶然的。可是，提出这样的问题，从而就阻止了对国际合作、解除军备、普遍或局部裁减军备、缔结互不侵犯公约，以及各种旨在消除战争威胁，保证国际安全的其他措施等重要问题作出决定。
    我必须追述，苏联至少在二十五年以前就碰到过对制订集体安全措施而提出的保留条件，与“先决条件”，和现在对讨论我们的宣言草案所提出的一模一样。
    大量缩减军备是建立安全的保证
    完成管制原子弹任务可激发信任
    当我们首次提出关于裁减军备、解除军备的建议时，那时，各位都知道，在欧洲事务中起领导作用的英、法代表们，和支持他们的美国代表们利用“首先是安全，然后才是裁军”的公式企图来阻挠这些建议。现在，稍微有一点改变了，他们说，“首先是信任，然后才是裁减军备，再后才是禁止原子武器”。话虽然改了，意思却是一样的。
    贝文先生在联合国大会全体会议上恰恰就这一“首先是安全，然后才是裁军”的公式发言时说，英国政府至今一直沿着它自从三十年代起便走着的道路前进，他说，那个时候的外交大臣就是他的前任汉德逊，按贝文先生说来，汉德逊在那时是积极为裁军而努力的。
    这句话就历史上说是不正确的，因为汉德逊的立场是充分支持庞古的。发明这个“首先需要建立安全的保证，其次才谈裁军”的公式的便是汉德逊。如所周知，英国代表团在那时曾尽一切可能来使苏联政府提出的裁军建议失败。但是贝文对于一种情势却一字不提，这一点我倒愿提醒他——当时汉德逊虽然反对裁军——在他看来应该首先建立安全的保证，但甚至他也不能不承认——而且他曾这样说——大量缩减军备本身便会大大地促进安全，因之便加强了信任，而且这样，它就可能是这种信任的保证。
    不幸的，贝文先生在这一方面却并没有追随他的前任——他这样称呼汉德逊先生，而仍然忠实于庞古的公式。但是这是他的事情。
    我的事情是要说明，虽然自那时起已经过了很长的时间了，但是英国对这一问题的态度仍然没有改变。
    贝文谈到苏联关于禁止原子武器问题的提案时，仍然保持我已说过的态度，他咬文嚼字地说，假若我们首先讨论原子武器的问题，那末我们两边争论的题目便极其简单了。贝文先生并称，像我在巴黎联合国大会会议上所说的，全部问题归根结底就是信任问题。
    这样，贝文先生就使我们记起了一九四八年他在巴黎会议上的发言。但他当时所说的许多话，归结起来，其含意只是笼统的一句话：“唯有安全感和信任足以导致裁军。”显然这句话是仓促提出的，因为仅有安全感是不能导致裁军的。如果我们回忆到贝文先生的前任汉德逊先生所说：反而是裁军可导致安全感的话，这一点就更明白了。汉德逊先生所说的比较更为正确。我认为他所说的才真正是正确的。
    但仍然可以试问贝文先生和与贝文先生抱同样想法的人们：究竟是什么东西阻止了这种安全感和信任使它们不能产生呢？如果贝文说：那很简单，所必要的就是要有信任感，那末我就要问究竟是什么妨碍了这种信任感呢？并且——我的第二个问题是——怎样才能使这种感觉终于能够如所需要的那样强烈，至少是强烈得使英国政府主张裁军并禁止原子弹呢？
    关于这一点，贝文先生——显然是对我国代表团讲话——宣称：门窗都不要关，帘子也不要放下，否则就不可能穿过门窗直看到里面，他说：因为在这种情况下“就不可能建立激发信任的坚固基础。”把他这种比喻用到实际问题上——这当然是我们所最感兴趣的，我认为这比任何别的事情都更使我们感到兴趣——，那末，就可以说：“敞开门窗，揭起帘子，使人能穿过门窗看到里面”这句话运用在禁止原子弹问题时，那就是说：组成一个国际管制机构，这个机构能够看见，听见，感觉到，接触到关于实现禁止原子弹方面所进行的工作——也许有一天我们会在这里一致宣布禁止原子弹。我但愿有这样一天！
    这就是说：问题是关系于一个国际管制机构的组织，它的权利，和它的管制权力。如果这一项任务完成了，那末显然就可以，照贝文所说的，谈到激发信任的坚固基础了，而信任也就将激发起来。
    三年前苏联曾经提出明确的提案
    对原子能采取管制和监督的措施
    好，我们暂且接受关于这个问题的这种提法。那末在这一方面的事情，真相是怎样的呢？就是说在组织一种管制，以便可以说：“门是打开的，窗户也是打开的，帘子已经卷起，那末观察、感觉、思考，而且满怀信任吧！”——这方面事情的真相是怎样的呢？
    这里提一提这个问题的历史——至少简单说几句——是必要的，我必须提一提。
    早在三年以前——一九四七年六月十一日，苏联曾向原子能委员会提出一个文件，明白地说必须采取管制和监督的措施，并且明确地说出了究竟是怎样的措施，该文件又指出：执行原子能委员会所决定进行的任何监督行动是可能的。根据我们的提案，在监督原子能企业方面，这个国际管制机构应当采取下列行动：
    （一）调查获取原子原料和原子能的企业的工作，并审查这些企业的档案。这将是国际监督的第一项权利，国际监督将在国际管制机构的指导下进行，当然和订立这个公约的任何一个国家的政府没有关系。
    （二）调查现有的原子原料、物资和半制品的存储。
    （三）在为管制原子物资和原子能的使用所必需的范围内调查生产活动。
    （四）监督管制公约所明令规定的企业技术运用规则的执行情形，并拟订为这些企业所必需遵守的技术管制规则。
    （五）收集和编制原子原料的采购、原子物资和原子能的生产等等的记录。
    所有这一切已在一九四七年七月十一日的文件中写得明明白白。不仅如此，这个文件提出并且答复了一个问题：如果这个公约被违犯时怎么办，怎样对付这种违反公约的行为？苏联对这个问题的答复是：如果发生怀疑，认为禁用原子武器的公约被违反的话，在国际管制机构的指导下活动的监督机构可以进行特别调查。如果产生这样一种怀疑，认为在某一地点、某一国家，有违反原子能生产公约情事发生，那末这个委员会有充分权利来进行特别调查。此外，正如后来在答复英国代表贾德干一九四七年八月十一日的特别询问时所解释的那样，这里所说的是：这种调查将由国际管制机构根据原子能委员会的意见来进行，这个委员会的决定不用一致通过，而是根据多数票、根据简单多数、不是根据一致原则。
    因此，国际管制机关，如果因怀疑而认为有必要的话，有充分权力来进行任何调查；这种怀疑可能是根据管制机关所收到的报告而产生的，也可能是这个国际管制机关自己产生的。这在我们的文件中也明白地讲到了。
    如遇对违反公约的事情有许多的怀疑时，这个一九四七年六月十一日的文件有一条具体的规定：监督机构可以“就防止和终止违反关于禁止原子武器及管制原子能公约的措施，向安全理事会提出建议”。
    批评我们的人要求有一切机会来监督原子企业中的情况。但是，我刚刚在这里宣读过的文件证明：早在三年以前就提交原子能委员会的建议，清楚地说明了国际管制机构有权派遣监督员到有这种怀疑的地方，根据国际管制机构的决定进行慎重而彻底的调查。
    除了这些之外，我还要说：这些文件指出，国际管制机构有权利作下述的事情：
    一、进入任何提炼，制造或储藏原子原料和物资、以及制造原子能的企业。
    二、在管制原子物资和原子能的使用所必须的范围内，了解各原子能企业的生产活动。
    三、衡量、调查并对原子原料、原子物资和半制成品作各种分析。
    四、向任何国家的政府索取关于原子能企业活动的各种情报和报告，并加以审核。
    我所复述的这一切都已确切地、清楚地、明确地、而不是模棱两可地、不是暖昧不明地写在我国政府一九四七年六月十一日提出的文件内，写在原子能委员会苏联代表在同年九月五日所发出的一封公函内，那封公函是答复当时的原子能委员会常任代表贾德干先生在一九四七年八月十一日所提出的问题，或者说询问的。事实是，贝文所要求于我们的——给以监督的余地——是已经有了的：门是开着的，窗户也是开着的，帘子已经卷起，任何人要想从窗户、大门与已经卷起的帘子往里看时，所需要的只是要除去遮住他们自己眼睛的东西而已，而他们自己又有一种起码的端庄的感觉就可以了——我不说信任，我只说端庄。
    艾奇逊巴鲁区的原子能管制计划
    反对实施任何生产原子弹的限制
    总之，所有这些事实，还有其他的一切，所有关于缺乏信任的反对、暗示与宣布等，以及还有一些有待证明的东西，我想凡是任何没有偏见，而具有理性的人，都只能把它们当作空话，说这种空话的人就是企图利用这些空话来掩蔽自己其实不愿意为了组织对原子能的真正国际管制而缔结任何协定，而他们之所以不愿意这样做，又并不是由于他们想要加强和平与合作的缘故。尽管我们已指出了各种事实，关于信任与不信任的同样的一些演说仍在继续发表，关于苏联所提的管制计划仍然在发表同样的批评，那种完全缺乏根据的批评。然而，苏联的国际管制的计划——其中心特点是监督——已充分满足了这一任务。甚至就连英国下院议员布拉克博恩先生这种怙恶不悛的苏联的敌人也不得不承认这一点。他在一九五○年三月在下院就这个问题发表演说时就亲自说过：“你们要知道，各位先生，我布拉克博恩，是下议院中一位激烈反苏的议员。”并且，这位按他自己说来是“激烈”反苏的下议院议员在英国议会中说，苏联（我是在引用公布过的谈话，我这里有英文的原文）“在原子能方面所给予的合作远较大多数人所显然想像到的要多得多”。不管他的政治观点如何，布拉克博恩谈到一九四七年六月十一日苏联的提案时他倒很老实和勇敢，他说：苏联的提案也包括他所说的不预先通知即行检查的规定。换句话说，布拉克博恩的意思是说：如果任何一个国家遵照苏联提案提供充分理由，国际监督员就有可能不预先特别通知可疑的国家即行前去视察工厂。
    我们这项计划既获得布拉克博恩肯定的评价——布拉克博恩是我们的政敌，但显然又是一个懂得原子战争或氢战争会造成怎样灾难的人，懂得这对于全人类（不拘其政治观点，不拘其政治的或宗教的信仰，不论存在于这个国家或那个国家内的政治的和社会的制度）会有怎样影响的一个人，那末，反对我们的计划的是什么东西呢？布拉克博恩先生懂得使用原子弹对于人类的命运所将造成的后果，特别是在这种武器不仅是在一方的手里有，而在敌方的手里也有这种武器的时候。
    那末，反对我们这项计划的究竟是什么东西呢？又是那个臭名昭彰的艾奇逊、巴鲁区、李连塞尔计划，那个计划的实际目的已由英国著名物理学教授贝尔纳给说明了，贝尔纳教授在英国某杂志发表的一篇论文中这样说：美英两国之所以坚持这项计划，不过是要拿这项计划当作防止实施任何对生产原子弹的限制的一种工具罢了。
    我们在前次会议中不是已经引述过像美国原子能委员会的公函一类的文件吗？这种文件说明艾奇逊，巴鲁区，李连塞尔三人所草拟的所谓国际管制计划根本就不会使原子武器的生产停止的。
    至于说美国计划中所规定的必须根据所谓分阶段（即分期）制度——这是你们都记得也都知道的——来建立的管制，这种管制，正像那位贝尔纳教授所说的那样，不能不阻碍实行那些要把原子能应用于和平目的上的计划，特别是对于那些需要使用原子能来达到它们的经济与工业和平建设之目标的国家——例如苏联——。在这一点上，我们必须记住：美国是完全不打算把原子能用在和平目的上的，因为它拥有其他的能源——如煤炭、石油和木材，这些能源，凭着美国现在所有的供给燃料的办法，足够供给它所有的工业企业，足够使它获得巨额的利润。但是，如果站在新的基础上加以改组，使原子能应用到和平目的上去，这就需要大量新的投资，结果当然要减少收入和利润；这是和在资本主义基础上组织起来的企业的利益不相符合的。
    当然，关于这个问题，我要留待将来联合国大会开始讨论原子问题时，再作更详细的审议。现在我认为我只需要重提一下我曾经在这里向委员会报告过的事情以使各国在这个重要问题上所持的立场明确化，并且重提一下，当我们在我们的宣言中专列一段叙述我们对于销毁原子武器的愿望、或至少是宣布我们具有禁止使用原子武器并将首先使用这种武器的政府定为战争罪犯的普遍的决心和意志时，我们内心确实有什么想法。
    美英统治集团充满了好战的阴谋
    以各种理由反对苏联的裁军建议
    至于我们关于裁减军备与军队三分之一的提案，我们在本届大会的一般辩论中与在以前历届大会上，已经听到了对这些提案的反对意见，但苏联代表团认为这些反对意见并不严重。
    据说——最重要的反对意见之一是这种裁减会故意地使各个具有不同战争潜力的国家处于不平等的地位，并且据说：在开始裁军三分之一以前，至少需要或多或少地使军队平等，这样，就军队来说，就不会对一方面有利，而说到这一方面，当然立刻受到注意的就是苏联。
    又据说，在目前条件下，这种裁减军备将只对具有较少战争潜力的国家有效，而对拥有大量战争潜力的国家便没有作用了。
    贝文先生曾企图讽刺这一点，他说，假若接受了这一提案，那末就会好像是高谈和平呼吁、和平运动，实际上却在树立某种宣传屏障以便在发动进攻之前削弱牺牲者。
    假如我们分析一下贝文先生的这些议论，那末会得出什么结论呢？结论是：苏联建议裁减三分之一的军备，即是力图削弱它将来进攻的牺牲者。可是鉴于我在这里所谈到的整个政策，你们有什么可以根据作这种推想呢？对于这一政策你们除了捏造所谓某种苏维埃“殖民主义”，某种“赤色帝国主义”等等之外，实在是无法反对的。而且这是发生在这样一个时候：就是说在其他国家驻有大批军队并正对各国——马来亚，越南和朝鲜——人民进行战争的是你们而不是我们，对于中国，你们正准备在那里滋事，想在建立联合国托管的伪装下攫夺中国的台湾——你们要至少割去中国人民不可转让的领土的一部分。
    这就是拿来冒充和平政策证据的东西。但是真正进行和平建设的却正是我们的国家，在那里，没有丝毫好战气氛或战争准备的迹象。亲爱的批评家们，至少你们应该读一下纽约时报记者沙利斯柏雷的莫斯科通讯，他谈到了莫斯科及苏联民用建设如火如荼的情况，在苏联，正在建筑着庞大的水电站，它的发电量超过世界最强大的水电站！但是在美国呢，整个统治集团的生活中都弥漫着好战的气氛，充满了好战的阴谋，而且，实际上已陷入战争狂之中。
    即使在这一点论据上，贝文也没有表现什么独创性——或者说：真知灼见。他仅仅在他的第二点论据上表现了某种独创性。你们也许记得，贝文在大会上说过：在裁减武装部队以前，必须将第五纵队从英国，以及他所谓西方其他“自由”国家驱逐出去。由他的话看来，仿佛英国的陆军不能够裁减，因为它是用来作国内的用途，不是来保卫边疆的。
    因此，我觉得，就是贝文提出的这唯一具有独创性的论据也和我们的问题无关。我们建议以五强实行缩减军备及武装部队作为第一个步骤，此后就可以而且应该在同一方向实行其他的步骤。
    我必须顺便说一句：我们对于我们的宣言——当时曾作为本委员会的文件散发——有一点修正。这就是：裁减军备三分之一，不是如原文所说的在一九五○年，而是一九五○——一九五一年。
    因此，我们认为一切关于战争潜力的话都是没有道理的，而且是虚伪的，如果我们也考虑问题的本质，那就更加是如此了。关于这五个——至少——安理会常任理事国的战争潜力的情况究竟怎样呢？我请你们注意著名的军事问题专家鲍尔温最近在纽约时报星期刊上发表的一篇论文。在这篇论文中，作者列出一个美国武装部队的清单，清楚地显示了美国的战争潜力。这篇论文表明：北大西洋公约的领袖绝不低估该集团中各成员国的战争潜力的水平，更不用说，它们对这一集团的武装部队寄予巨大而绝无根据的希望，迄今为止，它们一直在强调这一集团的优势，特别是在原子武器方面的优势。
    但是，无论如何，事实是：虽然由前述论文中所列举的材料看来，这些国家中有一些已经达到了很高的战争潜力水平，但是这一集团的国家还正在进行疯狂的扩军运动，而且拨出巨额款项供军备之需。
    美国统治集团为战争狂迷了心窍
    垄断企业在军事定货上搜括巨利
    仅就美国而论，在一九四九——一九五○年就拨出了一百三十多亿美元作为战争用途，而在战前的一九三八——一九三九年，却只有十亿多美元，因此，这次拨款超过了前一次十二倍。在一九五○——一九五一财政年度，美国计划支出约五百亿美元，比一九三八——一九三九年的支出几乎多五十倍。同时，美国还计划将它的陆海空军人数从一百五十万增加到三百万。这是美国总统杜鲁门在九月一日说出来的，当时他曾警告说：如果需要的话，军队人数还将进一步增加。
    大家知道，目前美国在国外维持着数十万脱离家庭和平生产与并从事各种各样战争冒险的官兵。大家知道，美国有数百个空军基地遍布世界各地。大家知道，美国已在加紧进行战略原料、资源与物资的动员并疯狂地进行重整军备运动。
    美国若干有势力的领袖，像美国副总统巴克莱所做的一样，公开宣称，美利坚合众国必须在全世界各地保有武装部队，并且说，美国“在冷战结束以前，可能不得不再占领若干国家。”
    这种战争狂热病对于美国垄断企业是甚为有利的，它们在军事定货上搜刮到巨额利润。现有材料证明，美国最大的四百五十家垄断庚秉纳本年第二季的利润总数较去年第二季高出了百分之四十三。
    至于美国统治集团对于解决原子问题的态度，艾奇逊先生在其开幕演说中已经谈及，在这问题上垄断企业的利益也支配着一切，把它们的努力导向扩展原子工业并且时时觅取新的拨款以制造原子武器，发明氢弹。为了使这个战争工业部门变成拥有数十亿元资本的部门，并且如一份美国杂志所表示的选样，使之成为美国最大的新兴工业，使这个部门成为真正庞大的“企业”，种种办法都用尽了。即使是现在，原子武器生产的投资几乎已达五十亿元，而为氢弹工作的每年支出已超过十亿元，这并不是偶然的。
    所有这一切都与原子托辣斯、供应军事装备与原子工业的物资的商人之发财致富有关，并且可以从下面这个事实中得到解释，就是说美国的统治集团现在可以说是已为战争狂迷了心窍，处在完全的战争昏迷与战争狂的状态之中。同时那些在军事目的上花费比往年为少的各国却被指责为图谋反对和平，而另一方面军费达数十亿元，超过了战前年代五十倍以上的那些国家却好像是一心一意要加强和平的。没有人会同意这种奇怪的逻辑！
    在美国，没有人对于利用原子能于和平目的是有兴趣的。
    贝尔纳教授在其令人颇感兴味的论文《原子——为战争呢？为和平呢？》中指出，除了这是极为勉强地留出来供医药上和生物学上某种目的之用的几公分追踪剂之外，美国实际上简直没有原子能用于和平这回事。
    美国的计划之所以把重点放在所谓对战争需要的国际管制上面，乃是为了迎合美国外交政策中主要倾向。这个重点也说明了为什么巴鲁区——李连塞尔计划并没有考虑个别国家经济上的特殊性和经济发展上的困难。这是区分美国与苏联对原子问题的分歧立场的根源之一。
    把原子企业的所有权转移给所谓国际管制机构这个建议是主要障碍之一，使人不能在对禁止原子能用于战争目的国际管制上获致协议。尽管艾奇逊——巴鲁区——李连塞尔计划（这是美国所谓国际管制计划的基础）是完全不能接受的，可是美国和英国显然都不想加以修正。艾奇逊先生在大会上说美国将继续小心地研究所有的建议，他这话没有什么重大的意义，因为艾奇逊有一个保留。他说这里所指的是那些按他说来将同样有效或者更加有效地促成这个目标的建议。换句话说，艾奇逊——巴鲁区——李连塞尔计划被认为是解决原子能使用问题的最有效的方法。
    苏联建议通过禁用原子武器宣言
    是全世界各国人民的良心的呼声
    苏联政府已经一再努力，将来它也准备同样地努力；作出一切必要的努力，以求解决这项原子问题、实现禁用原子武器，并对这种禁令的实施建立真正有效的国际管制，俾使不致有违犯或逃避这个禁令的情事发生。
    苏联代表团建议通过一篇关于原子武器的宣言，作为走向这个目标的第一步骤。宣言称：“鉴于原子武器用作侵略和大量毁灭人类的武器乃是违反良心和民族荣誉，且与联合国组织成员的资格相矛盾的，大会兹宣布无条件禁止原子武器，并建立严格的国际管制以保证这项禁令得以严格地无条件地实行。”
    我强调：这个宣言宣布了、表达了意志和决心，实际上这种宣言将有道义上的意义。
    同时，大会宣布——我还要强调“宣布”这个字——“首先对任何国家使用原子武器或大量毁灭人类的任何其他武器的政府，就是犯违反人道罪，并被视为战争罪犯”。
    全世界各国人民都这样要求。已有五万万人民签名提出这种要求，而且尽管在有些国家里，和平战士遭到恐怖与恫吓，和平斗士的队伍仍与日俱增。在这一队伍中，有许多举世闻名的人物：著名的科学家、作家、艺术工作者，许多国家的议会与立法议会的议员、著名社会名流与政治领袖，成千成万各种宗教信仰的牧师、农民、工人、知识分子。
    社会上的一切阶级，一切阶层的人民中每天都继续涌现出无私的和平战士、争取和平的斗士。
    我们不能不注意到美国一位科学家——原子学家的话。他说：“未来不属于制造原子弹与氢弹比其他国家为多的国家。未来属于首先为了其人民的和平进步而利用原子能的国家。”这位教授说：“我相信苏联人民已经在这样作。如果美国不试图达到同一地步，我们国家在世界上的政治威望将化为乌有。”
    我也不能不提到法国知识界向联合国抗议使用原子弹的信件（这一信件显然没有及时分发，至少未按照文件分发；我愿请贵主席注意把这封信分发给我们这个委员会的各国代表团）。在这封信上签名的人中间我们见到了杰出的法国科学家们，诺贝尔奖金的获奖人约里奥——居里、法国科学院院士摩根，索邦纳大学的名教授们及许多其他法国知识界极著名的代表人物。
    所以我说，我们提出的宣布原子弹为禁用武器，并宣布首先使用这一武器的政府为战争罪犯的建议，乃是已经在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签上了五万万个名字的世界各国人民的良心的呼声。有些人在谈到这一问题时想到这一宣言就觉得如此不愉快，但这一宣言存在着，而且已经用永不能磨灭的字迹把斯德哥尔摩的名字记载到世界历史中。
    这一建议对于消除战争威胁与加强和平的事业，具有非常的意义。
    苏联政府重申它争取无条件禁止原子武器的坚定决心。苏联政府一向坚持、现在仍坚持这个要求：苏联政府一向坚持、现在仍坚持实施足以保证防止把原子能用于战争目的的严格有效的国际管制。我们现在坚持、我们过去一直坚持而且将来还是要坚持这种主张，因为我们深信，支持这种建议的人数将会一天天增加，因为和平拥护者的行列正在壮大并将继续壮大，因为全世界人民都渴望和平，厌恶战争。
    美国利用新战争宣传来毒害人民
    苏联坚决主张应该制止这种宣传
    和平的敌人正广泛地利用报纸、广播与电影来宣传新战争，有系统地用这种宣传毒害着广大人民的思想。凡是真正要和平的人都不能容忍这种可耻的现象。我们不能考虑借口所谓不容许限制言论与新闻自由来反对禁止新战争宣传。所有这些借口我们必须坚决驳斥，因为它们是毫无根据的。然而，直到今天为止这种宣传却仍继续传播着；在某些国家里，这种宣传甚至规模越来越大，范围越来越广。
    举例来说吧，对于像美国海军部长马休斯这类新战争煽动者的说话，我们是不能置若罔闻的，他说：为了和平而强行促成合作起见，我们必须准备付出任何代价，即使这种代价包括宣战在内，也在所不惜。我相信，这种无耻的声明是不值一谈的。
    任何人也不能对英国议员怀特那一类的谈话默不作声，他主张“一劳永逸地结束关于禁止原子弹的伪善的呓语”；还有美国已卸任的国防部长詹逊的谈话，他屡次以加紧军备竞赛，特别是加紧制造原子武器与细菌武器的鼓动者的面孔出现；任何人也不能对美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷将军的话置之不理，他在他的公开演说中有系统地恣意对苏联造谣毁谤，鼓动加紧扩军与准备新战争。
    我们还必须提一提麦克阿瑟致“国外战争退伍军人协会的信”，那里面包含着对中国台湾及整个太平洋的公开掠夺计划，麦克阿瑟把台湾叫作“不沉的航空母舰”和潜艇基地，把太平洋叫做“广阔的壕堑”，“保护整个美洲大陆的盾牌”。
    苏联政府认为，对新战争的肆无忌惮的宣传，对攻击其他国家及夺取它们领土的无耻的挑拨，侵犯它们的领土主权及政治独立，是与联合国的原则、目的和任务不能并容的，它认为大会的职责是利用它的影响来制止这种宣传。如果考虑到战争宣传已为大会的一项决议所谴责的话，那这就更其是大会的职责了。这项决议建议联合国所有会员国政府采取措施鼓励爱好和平的宣传，以加强及发展各族人民间的友好关系。
    说到这里，我不禁想起杜勒斯一九五○年五月十六日在纽约国际大厦所发表的声明。杜勒斯那时说道：我们已不再需要仅仅从事于高谈阔论的国际委员会了，这种委员会成了在采取行动的道路上的新障碍。这是直接暗指联合国，因为从他的声明里直接可以看到是联合国妨碍了杜勒斯及其同谋者朝着我已经讲过的方向——实现美国侵略外交政策的方向采取行动。杜勒斯说，“在军事方面，我们需要最高盟国统帅部”。这就是这位“爱好和平的”人的愿望，有人还把他叫作是“最温柔的基督徒”。
    我们在前几届大会上，已举出一些新战争的挑拨者的名字，例如现在仍不罢休的邱吉尔；又如范西塔德，他已仍在努力继续进行他的宣传新战争的恶毒的工作，他正在借各种可怕的事情来施行威胁和恫吓，据他说，这些可怕的事情正在铁幕后面准备着，其实铁幕并不存在，正好像这些可怕的事情并不存在一样。
    苏联提案符合整个人类切身利益
    对所有侵略阴谋予以决定性打击
    我们的宣言草案是出于巩固和平的必要，该草案也注意到安全理事会的常任理事国的特殊责任、安全理事会的主要责任和我们这个组织里的所有会员国的责任，因为这些责任是彼此分不开的。
    我们的宣言建议大会向上述五大国呼吁，希望它们联合作和平努力，并在它们之间缔结巩固和平的公约。
    我们在去年也曾说过这话，并且我们现在也说这话，因为整个人类的切身利益需要这样做。
    主席先生，诸位代表，现在无需强调该提案的特别重要性。这个提案的通过将会予所有侵略阴谋以决定性的打击，予新战争的制造者的一切计划以决定性的打击，并将会对巩固和平与世界安全有极大的贡献。
    苏联代表团提请所有其他代表团注意的正是这一点。
                               （文内插题是本报编者所加的）
