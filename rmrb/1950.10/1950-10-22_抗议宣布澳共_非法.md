　　Protest Against Declaring the Australian Communist Party "Illegal"
    The Menzies reactionary government of Australia officially declared the Australian Communist Party "illegal" on the 20th. This reactionary measure by the Menzies government has brazenly deprived the Australian people of their last bit of democratic rights, placing them entirely under a dark fascist rule. This barbaric action of persecuting the Australian Communist Party and the Australian people was clearly carried out under the instruction of U.S. imperialism. We, the Chinese people, feel the same anger as the Australian people and express our firm protest against U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Menzies government.
    The Australian Communist Party is the loyal representative and resolute defender of the interests of the Australian working class and the Australian people. The Australian Communist Party has waged a constant and unremitting struggle to defend world peace and oppose U.S. imperialist aggression. The U.S. imperialist stooge, the Menzies reactionary government, proposed a bill to declare the Communist Party illegal as early as April this year, but it failed to pass due to the firm opposition of the Australian working class and the broad masses of the people. Now, with the expansion of U.S. imperialist aggression in Asia, the Menzies government has flagrantly taken this evil action regardless of everything, undoubtedly to clear away the forces opposing the war of aggression for U.S. imperialism in Australia, so as to make Australian manpower and material resources serve Wall Street's war plan.
    Suppressing the people's movements in various countries to defend peace and persecuting the vanguard of defending peace in various countries—the Communist Parties of various countries—is an important part of the U.S. imperialist war plan. Therefore, this reactionary anti-communist plan instigated by the U.S. imperialism is worldwide. They have not only done this in Australia, but also have done it, or are doing it, in other places. Brazil, Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Panama, Venezuela and other countries have already declared the Communist Party "illegal." In the United States, the American Communist Party is suffering extreme and unreasonable persecution. In Europe, U.S. imperialism has adopted despicable assassination activities, instructing the reactionaries in Belgium to murder Lahaut, the chairman of the Belgian Communist Party; and the leader of the French Communist Party, Duclos, was almost assassinated by thugs recently. In Asia, MacArthur, the war criminal who slaughtered the Korean people, is also cruelly suppressing the Japanese Communist Party with his bloody hands.
    However, the people of Australia and the world, like all the world, will never shrink from the great struggle against U.S. imperialism's destruction of peace and aggression. The Australian Communist Party's newspaper has announced the Australian Communist Party's determination to continue the struggle, and the working people of Australia have launched a powerful protest against the Menzies government's fascist measures to persecute the Australian Communist Party. This heroic determination and action of the Australian Communist Party and the Australian working people will surely be supported by the peace-loving people of the world, and in the common struggle, will finally crush the U.S. imperialist aggression plan.

### 抗议宣布澳共“非法”

　　抗议宣布澳共“非法”
    澳大利亚的孟席斯反动政府已于二十日正式宣布了澳大利亚共产党为“非法”。孟席斯政府的这一反动措施，横暴地剥夺了全澳人民的最后一点民主权利，使全澳人民完全处于法西斯的黑暗统治下。这一迫害澳共和全澳人民的野蛮行动，显然是在美帝国主义指使下进行的。我们中国人民和澳大利亚人民同样地感到愤怒，并对美帝国主义及其走狗孟席斯政府表示坚决的抗议。
    澳大利亚共产党是澳洲工人阶级和澳洲人民利益的忠实的代表者与坚决的保卫者。澳大利亚共产党为保卫世界和平、反对美帝侵略战争，进行了始终不懈的斗争。美帝走狗孟席斯反动政府，在今年四月已提出宣布共产党为非法的法案，由于澳大利亚工人阶级和广大人民的坚决反对而未能实现。现在，随着美帝在亚洲的侵略行动的扩大，孟席斯政府悍然不顾一切地采取了这一罪恶行动，无疑地是为美帝在澳洲清除反对侵略战争的力量，以便将澳大利亚人力、物力，为华尔街的战争计划服务。
    镇压各国人民保卫和平的运动，迫害各国保卫和平的先锋——各国共产党，是美帝国主义战争计划的重要组成部分。因此，美帝所策动的这一反动的反共计划是有世界性的，他们不仅在澳大利亚这样作了，而且在其他地方也已经这样作，或正在这样作。巴西、秘鲁、智利、玻利维亚、巴拿马、委内瑞拉等国早已宣布共产党为“非法”了。在美国，美共遭受着极端无理的迫害。在欧洲，美帝国主义采取卑劣的暗害活动，指使比利时的反动派杀害了比共主席拉豪特；法共领袖杜克洛在最近也几被暴徒所暗杀。在亚洲，屠杀朝鲜人民的战犯麦克阿瑟，也正以其血手残酷地镇压着日本共产党。
    但是，全澳洲和全世界人民一样，对于反对美帝破坏和平进行侵略战争的伟大斗争，是绝不会退缩的。澳共的机关报已经宣布了澳共继续斗争的决心，全澳洲劳动人民已对孟席斯政府迫害澳共的法西斯措施展开了有力的抗议行动。澳共和澳大利亚劳动人民的这种英勇斗争的决心和行动，必然会得到全世界爱好和平人民的支持，并将在共同斗争中，最后粉碎美帝国主义的侵略计划。
