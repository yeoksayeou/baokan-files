The Chinese People Fight for Peace
    ——A Record of the Exhibition of Materials on the Signature Campaign for the Peace Declaration of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace
    By Our Correspondent Cheng Guangrui
    In our country, where a surge of peaceful construction is rising everywhere, nearly 200 million people have already signed the Peace Declaration. This is a tremendous force, a serious warning to the warmongers, and a powerful demonstration against the American aggressors.

    The China Committee for the Defense of World Peace, in order to welcome the Second World Peace Congress and strengthen the propaganda for the defense of peace, has specially organized the Exhibition of Materials on the Signature Campaign for the Peace Declaration at the Beijing Labor People's Cultural Palace from the 21st to the 24th of this month. At this exhibition, we can see how enthusiastically the Chinese people are contributing all their strength to the cause of defending world peace.

    This exhibition systematically introduces the development process of the peace signature campaign.

    On May 14th, under the auspices of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace, Beijing held a peace signature campaign rally. Following this, the movement rapidly spread to all parts of the country. The broad masses of the people responded enthusiastically to the great call. Over the past five months, 34 major and branch committees have been established in various places, and a vigorous peace signature campaign has been launched throughout the country.

    At the Second Plenary Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, our great leader Chairman Mao solemnly signed his name on the Peace Declaration.

    Workers in various places enthusiastically signed the Peace Declaration, guaranteeing to complete production tasks and increase the strength to defend peace.

    In the countryside, where social reforms such as land reform and rent reduction have been implemented, the broad masses of peasants participated in the peace signature campaign. The signatures of a large number of peasants have greatly increased the number of peace signatures nationwide.

    Millions of commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army enthusiastically participated in the signing and made solemn oaths. At this exhibition, we see the letter of determination from Sun Rongqing, a soldier of the 10th Cavalry Regiment of Inner Mongolia, illustrating the firm will of the PLA soldiers to defend peace. He said: We oppose wars of aggression not because we fear war. If any imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression, we will use a war of justice to eliminate the war of aggression!

    Several photos show us that people of all ethnic groups living in the interior and scattered in remote border areas have signed their names on the Peace Declaration in various different languages. Believers of various religions: Christians, Buddhists, and Lamaists, have all signed the Peace Declaration, expressing their common desire to defend world peace and oppose wars of aggression.

    All kinds of signed silk banners, exquisitely bound signature books, and bundles of signature forms filled the last few rooms of the exhibition. Some of them were painted with peace doves, and some with cartoons. People signed their names in various different ways, some drawing a "+" sign, and some pressing red or black fingerprints. These countless different signatures show a common belief, which is, as a visitor wrote in the opinion book: "The powerful call for defending peace will drown out the clamor of the warmongers."

    "The Victory of the Chinese People," a set of photos, is an important part of this exhibition. After viewing this set of photos, it is not difficult to understand why so many people in our country have signed the Peace Declaration.

    Under the leadership of their great leader Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, after the land revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation, finally formally established the People's Republic of China a year ago, bringing a new era of peaceful construction to the Chinese people. In the photos, we can see: In the Northeast, the huge Fengman hydroelectric power station supplies abundant electricity to the Northeast industrial zone. Coal miners in Fushun, steelworkers in Anshan, and spinners in Shanghai are working hard and enthusiastically for the construction of the motherland.

    Victory has brought a peaceful and happy life to the Chinese people.

    From the photos, we get the following vivid impressions:

    On the vast state farms in the Northeast, our female tractor drivers are driving tractors.

    On the fertile grasslands of Inner Mongolia, herdsmen are grazing herds of cattle and sheep.

    Workers are learning culture and technology. Peasant women are entering literacy classes.

    The youth of Beijing are spending a pleasant summer at the seaside summer camp, swimming and singing collectively. They gaze at the beautiful sea at dusk, dreaming of their bright future.

    In the nurseries, children are playing happily, lively and healthy...

    However, American imperialism launched the criminal war of aggression against Korea and extended the flames of war to the borders of China. Today, the peaceful life of the Chinese people is again threatened by the imperialist war of aggression against Korea. Imperialism's expansion of the war of aggression has aroused widespread anger among the Chinese people. Since the United States launched the war of aggression and continued to expand its aggression, the number of peace signatures in our country has increased from 26,710,367 to 197,577,010.

    We cannot sit idly by and ignore the American aggression against Korea and the expansion of aggression in the Far East. Let's look at another set of photos: At the Beijing celebration of the first National Day on October 1st, Chairman Mao reviewed our powerful infantry, cavalry, tank units, chariot units, and the ranks of young soldiers of our navy and air force... These soldiers have all signed their names on the Peace Declaration, and now, in order to deal with the new threat from imperialism, they are determined to fulfill their solemn vows.

　　中国人民为和平而斗争
    ——记中国保卫世界和平大会委员会和平宣言签名运动资料展览会
    本报记者  程光锐
    在到处高涨着和平建设热潮的我们的国家里，将近二万万人民已经在和平宣言上签了名。这是一支巨大的力量，这是对战争贩子们的严重的警告，对美国侵略者的强大示威。
    中国保卫世界和平大会委员会，为了迎接第二次世界保卫和平大会，并加强保卫和平的宣传，特自本月二十一日至二十四日，在北京劳动人民文化宫举办和平宣言签名运动资料展览会。在这个展览会上，我们可以看到中国人民是如何热烈地为保卫世界和平事业而贡献出自己的一切力量。
    这个展览会系统地介绍了和平签名运动的发展过程。
    五月十四日，在中国保卫世界和平大会委员会主持下，北京市举行了和平签名运动大会，接着，这一运动迅速地扩展到全国各地去。广大的人民热烈响应和大号召，五个月来，各地先后成立了三十四个和大分会，并在全国各地展开了如火如荼的和平签名运动。
    在人民政协全国委员会第二次全体会议上，我们伟大的领袖毛主席在和平宣言上庄严地签上了自己的名字。
    各地工人们热烈地在和平宣言上签了名，他们保证完成生产任务，增加保卫和平的力量。
    在实行了土地改革和减租减息等社会改革的农村里，广大的农民参加了和平签名，大批农民的签名，使全国和平签名人数激增。
    数百万解放军指战员们，热烈地参加了签名，并立下了庄严的誓言。在这展览会上我们看到内蒙骑兵第十团战士孙荣庆的决心书，说明了解放军战士们保卫和平的坚决的意志。他说：我们反对侵略战争并不是惧怕战争，假如任何帝国主义胆敢发动侵略战争，我们就用正义的战争来消灭侵略战争！
    有几幅照片使我们看到居住在内地和散居在辽远边地的各族人民，用各种不同的文字，在和平宣言上签上了自己的名字。各种不同宗教信仰的教徒们：基督教的、佛教的和喇嘛教的教徒们，都在和平宣言上签了名，表示保卫世界和平，反对侵略战争的共同愿望。
    各式各样的签名的绸子，装订精致的签名册，一捆一捆的签名书，放满了展览会的最后几间房子里。它的上面有的画上了和平鸽，有的画着漫画。人们用各种不同的方式签了名，有的画上了“十”字，有的捺上了红色或黑色的手印。这些难以数计的不同的签名，显示了一个共同的信念，这就是如一个参观者在意见簿上写着的话：“强大的保卫和平的呼声，将淹没好战分子们的叫嚣。”
    “中国人民的胜利”一组照片，是这个展览会中的重要部分。我们看过了这一组照片，就不难理解为什么在我们的国家里有如此众多的人民在和平宣言上签名。
    中国人民在自己的伟大领袖毛泽东的领导下，经过了土地革命、抗日战争和解放战争，终于在一年前正式建立了中华人民共和国，给中国人民带来了开始和平建设的新时代。我们在照片上可以看到：在东北，小丰满的巨大的水力发电站供给了东北工业区的丰富的电力。抚顺的煤矿工人、鞍山的钢铁工人、上海的纺纱工人，为建设祖国而紧张、热烈地工作着。
    胜利给中国人民带来了和平幸福的生活。
    从照片上我们得到如下的一些鲜明的印象。
    在东北的广阔无边的国营农场上，我们的女拖拉机手正驾驶着拖拉机奔驶着。
    在内蒙丰饶的草原上，牧民们正放牧着成群的牛羊。
    工人们在学习文化，学习技术。农妇们进入识字班。
    北京的青年们在海滨夏令营度过愉快的夏天，他们在集体游泳、集体唱歌。她们在黄昏的海滨远眺着美丽的海，想望着她们美好的将来。
    在托儿所里，孩子们愉快地嬉戏着，活泼而健康……
    但是，美帝国主义发动了侵略朝鲜的罪恶战争，并且把战火延烧到中国的边境。今天，中国人民的和平生活又受到帝国主义侵朝战争的威胁。帝国主义扩大侵略战争，激起中国人民普遍的愤怒。自美国发动侵略战争并继续扩大侵略以来，我国的和平签名人数已从二六、七一○、三六七人增至一九七、五七七、○一○人。
    我们对美国侵朝和扩大在远东的侵略行为绝不能坐视不顾。我们再看看另一组照片：在十月一日北京庆祝第一届国庆节的大会上，毛主席检阅着我们的强大的步兵、骑兵、坦克部队、战车部队，检阅着我们的海军和空军的青年战士的行列……这些战士们都曾在和平宣言上签上了自己的名字，现在为了对付帝国主义的新威胁，他们是决心实践他们的庄严誓言的。
