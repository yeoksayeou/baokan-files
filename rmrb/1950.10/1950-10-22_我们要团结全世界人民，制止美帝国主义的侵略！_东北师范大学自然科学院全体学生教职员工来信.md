　　We must unite the people of the world to stop the aggression of U.S. imperialism!
    Letter from all students, faculty, and staff of the College of Natural Sciences, Northeast Normal University
    Editor's note: The Student Union of Northeast Normal University, all faculty and staff of the College of Liberal Arts, all faculty and staff of the College of Natural Sciences, faculty and students of the Department of Physics, students of Class One of the Mathematics Specialization Course, and all women in the First Faculty and Staff Dormitory sent nine letters protesting the aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism. Due to space limitations, one letter is selected for publication, and the rest have been forwarded to relevant parties.
                  Dear Editor:
    With unbearable anger, we strongly protest the insane aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism in reconnaissance and bombing of our Northeast.
    We grew up in China's difficult times, and for a long time, we suffered the humiliation and oppression of imperialism, living a life of poverty. We are very familiar with the hideous face of imperialism; we remember every debt of blood owed by imperialism in our hearts and can never forget it.
    For thirty years, Chairman Mao and the Communist Party have led us in arduous struggle, bloodshed, and sacrifice, smashing the rule of imperialism and its running dogs, and establishing the brilliant People's Republic of China. How we cherish and love this victory! In the past year, we have deeply felt the warmth of the motherland, and we can see that both cities and villages are developing rapidly. We know that a happy and peaceful life has begun, and our country's future is so bright and promising!
    However, at this very moment, U.S. imperialism—the mortal enemy of the Chinese people—dares to invade our land, harm our people, and destroy our property. This behavior of U.S. imperialism is clearly an attempt to expand the war of aggression in Korea into an aggression against China. This is intolerable!
    We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and demand that the United Nations General Assembly promptly and effectively stop the aggressive atrocities of U.S. imperialism!
    At the same time, we are determined to respond to the atrocities of U.S. imperialism with practical actions. First, we will work with peace of mind, actively complete our teaching tasks, raise our vigilance, and strengthen all preparations. We are even prepared to give everything we have, if necessary, to fight to the end to defend our motherland.
    We warn U.S. imperialism: The Chinese people have undergone a long period of struggle and testing and have taken control of state power. We love peace, but we are not afraid of war. We once drove Japanese imperialism out of China, and we also drove you out of mainland China and defeated your running dog Chiang Kai-shek. We firmly believe that the people of the world are united with us and will surely defeat the aggression of imperialism.
          All faculty, staff, and students of the College of Natural Sciences, Northeast Normal University

　　我们要团结全世界人民，制止美帝国主义的侵略！
    东北师范大学自然科学院全体学生教职员工来信
    编者按：东北师范大学学生会、文学院全体教职员同学、自然科学院全体教职员工友、物理系师生、数学专修科一班同学、第一教职员宿舍全体妇女等寄来抗议美帝国主义侵略行为的信九封。因篇幅关系，特选登一封，其余已转寄有关方面。
                  编者同志：
    我们怀着难忍的愤怒，严重抗议美帝侦察、轰炸我东北的疯狂侵略罪行。
    我们生长在中国艰苦的年代，长期身受过帝国主义的凌辱压迫，过着贫困的生活。帝国主义的狰狞面目，我们十分熟悉；帝国主义的笔笔血债，我们都牢记在心，永远不能忘掉。
    三十年来，毛主席、共产党领导我们艰苦奋斗，流血牺牲，粉碎了帝国主义及其走狗的统治，建立起光辉灿烂的中华人民共和国。这个胜利果实，我们是怎样的珍惜爱护！一年来，我们深深感受到祖国的温暖，我们看得见无论是城市乡村，都在飞跃发展。我们知道，幸福和平的生活已经开始，我国的前途，是怎样的光辉远大！
    但是，正在这个时候，美帝国主义——中国人民的死敌，竟胆敢侵略我国土地，伤害我国人民，破坏我国财产。美帝国主义此种行为，显然企图把侵略朝鲜战争扩大为对中国的侵略。是可忍，孰不可忍！
    我们坚决拥护周外长的声明，要求联合国大会迅速有效地制止美帝的侵略暴行！
    同时，我们决心以实际行动来回答美帝的暴行，首先安心工作，积极完成教学任务，提高警惕，加强一切准备工作。我们更准备在必要时付出自己的一切，为保卫祖国奋斗到底。
    我们警告美帝国主义：中国人民经过了长期的斗争考验，掌握了国家政权。我们热爱和平，但是也不怕战争。我们曾经把日本帝国主义打出中国去，也曾把你们赶出中国大陆，击败了你们的走狗蒋介石。我们坚信：全世界的人民都和我们团结在一起，一定能击败帝国主义的侵略。
          东北师范大学自然科学院全体教职员工
