The Beijing Municipal People's Government Sanitation Engineering Bureau, recognizing that the original garbage handcarts were mostly broken and unusable, began designing and manufacturing new carts in August. As of now, half of the city's more than one thousand garbage handcarts have been replaced with new-style carts. The new garbage handcarts were designed after careful research by the bureau, with a capacity increased by 0.6 cubic meters. They have been changed to iron wheels with rubber tires, making them not only easier to use but also less damaging to the road surface. To prevent dust from flying and garbage from being dropped along the way during transportation, a canvas awning has been installed on top of the cart. The entire cart is painted dark green. The sanitation team members are very fond of these new green carts and express that they will wash them regularly to keep them clean.

　　京市卫生工程局制造大批垃圾车
    京市人民政府卫生工程局鉴于原有的垃圾手车多已破坏不堪，不能使用，于八月起即开始设计制造新车。截至目前止，全市一千余辆垃圾手车中已有半数换为新式手车。新式垃圾手车是经过该局缜密研究后设计的，容量较前增大○·六公方，改为铁轮胶皮带，使用不单轻便，对街道路面亦不致损害。为了防止在运输中灰尘飞扬，沿路遗落垃圾，特在车箱顶上装置了帆布蓬罩。全车油深绿色。清洁队的队员们对这一批绿色的新车，非常爱护，他们表示：一定要经常洗刷，保持清洁。
