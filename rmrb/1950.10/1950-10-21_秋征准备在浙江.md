Preparations for this year's agricultural tax collection in the newly liberated areas, if not done well, will directly hinder the smooth progress of land reform after the autumn harvest. "To do a good job in this year's autumn grain collection" has become the common aspiration of all cadres and the broad masses in the newly liberated areas. But how can this year's autumn grain collection be done well? Good wishes alone are not enough; thorough preparation is also essential.

(1) Land Consolidation

The fundamental reason for the inequities (too light or too heavy) that occurred in last year's autumn grain collection was: inaccurate land measurements, unreliable yields, and a lack of reliable grain collection materials. This year, Zhejiang Province began land consolidation in June in a planned manner, requiring that information on the number of households and population, land area, and tenancy relationships be clarified to ensure that grain collection is consistent with or close to reality.

Zhejiang Province has a total of 81 counties and cities, and 491 districts. Of these, 12 counties and 71 districts had completed surveying and mapping by the Kuomintang Land Administration Bureau; 25 counties and 163 districts had begun surveying but not completed it; and 44 counties and 257 districts had not been surveyed. We first studied the types, contents, and historical completeness of the old land data in different regions, and then, based on the existing main data and the local mass conditions and work foundation, proposed different methods and steps for land consolidation in different regions. As of the end of September, land consolidation work has been basically completed throughout the province, except for a few areas seriously affected by banditry. According to statistics from the Shaoxing Special District, after land consolidation, the land area generally increased by 20 to 40 percent compared with last year, and in some areas it increased by 69 percent. This has laid a good foundation for implementing the agricultural tax law in the newly liberated areas.

Experience has shown that fully utilizing old materials, appropriately using old personnel (and also absorbing educated youth, primary school teachers, retired military personnel, etc.), and mobilizing the masses to check and report discrepancies are effective methods for consolidating land in the newly liberated areas. This not only makes it easy to clarify the land area in a timely manner but also avoids confusion. At the beginning, some special districts or counties overemphasized the shortcomings and complexity of the old materials, and always wanted to apply the experiences of the old liberated areas, such as mobilizing the masses to report and mark land, resulting in wasted manpower and resources without achieving the desired results. Experience has also shown that old materials have shortcomings, and many of them. But as long as they are used consciously, rather than blindly, there is no need to fear their shortcomings. The land measurements in the old materials are also inaccurate (for example, in areas of Zhejiang that have not been surveyed, the accuracy of land measurements is generally only 70 to 80 percent, and in some areas only 50 to 60 percent. In Changxing County, the old materials generally discounted paddy fields by 20 percent, dry land by 30 percent, and mountains by 50 percent), but as long as the difference or ratio between them and the actual numbers is investigated and studied, one can "have a clear picture in mind." Precisely because the old materials have shortcomings and are inaccurate, they need to be consolidated and the masses mobilized to check them, which is much more stable and convenient than blindly mobilizing the masses to report land ownership without any materials. Of course, it is also wrong to use old materials without reforming them and blindly trusting their accuracy.

(2) Setting the Yield

In addition to clarifying the land area, the most important link in implementing policies and completing tasks is the normal annual yield of the land. Yield is a more difficult issue to grasp than land area, and it has more flexibility. Therefore, setting the yield has become the key to whether this year's autumn grain collection can be done well. Zhejiang is addressing this issue from two aspects.

First, solving the problem of yield determination methods.

At the beginning, there were two different methods: one was to apply the "democratic appraisal" and "self-reporting and public discussion" methods of the old liberated areas, which has been proven to be unworkable in the newly liberated areas; the other was the method of "dividing into sections for appraisal, classifying and converting, investigating and determining yield, and combining with appraisal," which was explored in experiments. Experience has shown that this is a method that is suitable for the conditions of the newly liberated areas, simple and feasible, and easy to achieve results.

Why do "democratic appraisal" and "self-reporting and public discussion" not work in the newly liberated areas? The yield determination work decides how much agricultural tax each farmer pays to the state. The general rule is: in areas where the masses have a high level of awareness and there is strong leadership, the yield is appraised fairly, reasonably, and close to reality. In general areas, the phenomenon of "village centrism" is difficult to overcome for a while, forming a situation where honest people suffer losses, clever people take advantage, and there is an imbalance that is difficult to rectify. Some areas have tried to apply the experiences of the old liberated areas, resulting in activists becoming detached from the masses, cadres and the masses becoming opposed to each other, the masses pulling down, and the cadres pushing up. A long time was spent, but the yield was not appraised well, and the masses were not satisfied.

What is the method of "dividing into sections for appraisal, classifying and converting, investigating and determining yield, and combining with appraisal"?

"Dividing into sections for appraisal" means dividing fields with the same soil quality into several sections, and letting the masses appraise the differences between the sections, only appraising the grades, not the yield. The sections should not be too large or too small. If they are too small, it will be like "stars all over the sky," costing the masses a lot of effort and easily causing well-managed households to suffer losses and poorly managed households to benefit. If they are too large, they will not be properly defined, and will create a situation where "bad land suffers losses and good land benefits."

"Classifying and converting" means classifying mountains and ponds outside the main paddy fields and dry land into several categories according to different yields, and appraising the conversion ratio with paddy fields and dry land. For example, if the general land in the local area is paddy fields, then appraise how many acres of mountain land or miscellaneous land in the local area are equivalent to one acre of paddy field; if the general land in the local area is dry land, then appraise the conversion ratio of other land to it. In some areas, the masses are willing to use the method of dividing into sections for appraisal or classifying for appraisal for paddy fields, dry land, mountains, and ponds, rather than classifying and converting. This depends on the specific conditions and circumstances of each place, with simplicity and rationality as the principle.

"Investigating and determining yield" means that the government (can collaborate with activists, farmer representatives, production models, etc.) conducts in-depth investigation and research according to the materials appraised by the masses in sections, and finds out the yield of each section, each grade, and each category. That is, determining the yield based on investigation. When investigating and determining the yield, it is also not necessary to go to each section and each grade. According to the experience of Changshan County, the simplest and most correct method is to find a representative section (or village) and a general section (or village) in each district for comparison. As long as the yield of this representative section is determined realistically, fairly, and reasonably as a standard, it is possible to calculate the yield of other sections, grades, and categories according to the differences between the sections, grades and categories. In this way, the yield between townships and districts is easy to balance and unify, and the masses are also easy to accept. It is not difficult to determine the yield of this representative section. The important thing is to learn from the masses. For example, Quzhou held a district head meeting. No one could say anything about the actual situation on the yield determination issue, resulting in the yield being pulled down a lot. A representative who attended the National Labor Model Conference spoke out the yield of each section in the county in one breath, leaving everyone speechless and unable to deny that it was in line with reality. Changshan County held a district head meeting, and each district found several elderly farmers to determine a draft yield for the entire county, which was taken back to each district for comparison. The farmers unanimously believed that it was fair and reasonable, and there were few changes. This approach is both realistic and saves time. The key lies in investigation and research, mastering the materials, and being realistic. (The old tax rate grades and land prices are also important reference materials in yield determination and cannot be ignored.)

"Combining with appraisal" means that the government's investigation and yield determination plan is discussed and approved by the township farmer representative conference, and individual inappropriate places are revised. Then, this realistic, fair, and reasonable yield determination is implemented among the masses. The top-down investigation and yield determination and the bottom-up discussion and revision must be closely combined, and cannot be isolated from each other, otherwise it will form a "production quota assignment." In particular, in mountainous areas or areas with relatively complex soil, the fields are scattered, the soil quality is different, the yields vary greatly, and the area is inconsistent. It is inevitable that the yield will be particularly high or particularly low in the same section, and individual necessary revisions must be made in combination with appraisal. According to the experience of Changshan County, holding farmer representative conferences, summarizing production, commending models, deeply mobilizing the masses, conducting production education, and passing yield determination is the best method. The masses will understand from the achievements of the people's government in leading production over the past year that yield determination is also for production. For example, the representatives of Songxia District, Shangyu County, Shaoxing Special District, said: "We originally thought that the government asking us for things was always bad, but now we understand that grain collection is the capital for the poor to turn over." Jiujiangmiao Village in Jiangdong District had three books of land registers. Last year, one book (the most inaccurate) was handed over. During land consolidation, the second book (also inaccurate) was handed over. And after understanding the significance of yield determination and the grain collection methods at the farmer representative conference, in order to have a reasonable burden and carry out land reform in the future, the third book (the accurate one) was handed over.

This new method is from the masses, using appraisal by grade, classification, and investigation to determine the yield, and then returning to the masses in combination with appraisal. Whenever the appraisal by grade, classification, and investigation is in line with reality, and after full deliberation, individual revisions have been made in combination with appraisal, it can not only be successfully passed, but also quickly accepted by the masses, who believe that this is relatively fair and reasonable.

Second, solving the ideological problems of yield determination.

Zhejiang Province fully entered the yield determination work in early October. In order to determine the yield well, it is necessary to solve the ideological deviations in yield determination, first of all, the ideological deviations of the cadres. According to preliminary understanding, these ideological deviations are mainly:

1. In rich areas, according to the trial calculation of typical townships, the results of calculating the tax rate according to the actual yield may exceed the task. Therefore, the idea of ​​suppressing the yield and "just completing the task" was generated. In poor areas, if the tax rate is calculated according to the actual yield, the task cannot be fully completed, and there is also a tendency to want to increase the yield.

2. "The tax rate is the task." Some people believe that the lower the yield is set, the smaller the task is, which is convenient for completing the task.

3. It is believed that setting the yield too high is a violation of policy. Setting the yield too low, at most, affects the completion of the task, and there is no problem with the implementation of the policy.

4. It is believed that setting the yield lower is easier to talk to the masses, and the relationship between cadres and the masses is easy to improve.

5. It is believed that last year's grain collection required landlords to bear more burden (in fact, the arrears are still very large), and this year the government should suffer a little loss. After the rectification campaign, the cadres have undergone obvious changes in the implementation of policies and the mass viewpoint. However, in yield determination, the tailism deviation was shown among district and township cadres. Therefore, "we must oppose the deviation of simply completing the task regardless of the policy, and at the same time prevent the deviation of emphasizing difficulties and letting things go" (Instructions of the State Council on the Collection of Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas). Experience has shown that correcting thinking, being realistic, and handling affairs in accordance with regulations are the primary link in determining the yield well and correctly implementing the policy of reasonable burden.

(3) Combining with Rent Reduction

Only clarifying the population, land, and yield, without agreeing on the rent amount, it is still difficult to calculate the burden amount for households with tenancy relationships. Therefore, the third step is to combine rent reduction with grain collection, and to determine the percentage of rent shared by the owner and tenant, so as to calculate the tenancy burden in a timely manner. Some counties in Zhejiang convene both owners and tenants (one tenant representative is selected from each village, and one owner representative is selected from each township) to the county to discuss rent, which has the advantage of making the rent discussion work from decentralized and complicated to centralized and simple, not only can it be handled in accordance with policies and laws, but also those stubborn landlords have no tricks to use; it not only solves the farmers' rent reduction requirements, but also eliminates the landlords' concerns about farmers not paying rent and lowering the agreed yield. It is also convenient for timely transfer and registration to calculate the burden. At the meeting, the landlords should be told about the principle of adding two and subtracting two (that is, calculating the rental income of 100 jin as 120 jin), explaining that this is not only reasonable, but also contains the meaning of encouraging labor production. The tenants should be told that this year's rent reduction should not only make the landlords enough to pay the burden, but also enough to live on, otherwise it will also be unfavorable to the farmers. A rent discussion experiment should be conducted in a key township to absorb experience and solve the specific problems of the burden on both landlords and tenants, such as the relationship between the normal annual yield of agricultural tax and the agreed yield for rent, the burden of large and small landlords, the burden of rotation land, and the burden of landlords who are difficult to attribute to households. Solving the tenancy burden problem carefully and correctly is a very important link in implementing policies and ensuring tasks. This cannot be taken lightly.

(4) Assigning Households and Creating Lists

After the population, land, yield, and tenancy issues are clarified, the work of assigning households, creating lists, and creating strings (that is, filling out tax payment notices) begins, combined with investigation and appraisal (calculating, checking, and appraising tax reductions and exemptions), and mobilizing the masses to collectively pay grain. This is the end of the preparatory work for grain collection and the beginning of the grain collection action.

In order to ensure the tax rate is calculated according to the law and overcome the blindness of task allocation, Zhejiang Province generally adopts the method of centrally conducting household registration and calculating burdens in the county this year. Assistants are hired and a responsibility system is adopted, that is, a few people are responsible for the calculation and registration of several townships, and are responsible for it from beginning to end.

The township (village) organizes a township agricultural tax investigation and evaluation committee including representatives from all levels. Its main tasks are: First, according to the list of grain collection compiled by the county government, publicize the amount of tax payable by each household, and tell each household how this figure was calculated, mobilizing the masses to check whether it is in line with the household's population, land, yield, and tenancy relationship. Second, evaluate tax reductions and exemptions (including disaster relief and care for revolutionary martyrs, disabled soldiers, widowed elderly, and households with special difficulties). After checking and confirming that there are no errors, evaluating tax reductions and exemptions, and reporting to the county for approval, the grain will be listed for payment, and a grain payment plan will be formulated to check the grain quality, and a mass collective grain payment movement will be launched to "pay quickly, pay well, and pay in full." Here, it is very important and cannot be ignored to expose the rumors of reactionary landlords and special agents in time and suppress their sabotage activities.

(5) Collective Grain Payment

After all the above preparatory work has been done and it has been fully matured, the conditions for launching a collective grain payment movement are available. According to the experience of several key grain collection townships in Jinhua, as long as preparations are done well, the grain payment work of a township can be completed smoothly in three or four days. Here, the preparation of warehouses (sound internal organization, strict warehousing plan, accurate planning, clear procedures, rapid receipt, good order, and timely reporting), especially the correct explanation and clarification of the arrears problem last year, and dispelling the concerns of taking the lead in suffering losses (last year, there were still many arrears from landlords in Zhejiang's grain collection, and the masses criticized us: "Those who pay first are beaten, those who pay late are scolded, and those who do not pay are fine."), is the key to launching a collective grain payment movement.

Zhejiang Province is now entering a tense stage of determining yield, discussing rent, assigning households, and creating lists. By the end of October, each county will have a grain payment demonstration in a township (or district), and comprehensive grain collection will begin in November. If each county can conscientiously do the preparatory work according to the instructions of the provincial government, then it can be believed that the entire province will be able to complete the grain collection task in an orderly manner in accordance with the central agricultural tax law by the end of November.

    秋征准备在浙江
    左春台
    今年新区征收农业税的工作，如果做得不好，将会直接妨碍秋收后土地改革工作的顺利进行。“要将今年的秋征做好”，已成为新区全体干部和广大人民的一致愿望。但怎样才能将今年的秋征做好呢？仅有良好的愿望是不够的，还必须有充分的准备工作。
    （一）整理土地
    去年秋征发生畸轻畸重偏向的基本原因是：地亩不确，产量不实，缺乏可资依据的征粮材料。今年浙江省于六月份即有步骤地开始了整理土地的工作。要求把户数人口、土地面积、租佃关系等三个材料搞清楚，求得征粮符合实际或接近实际。
    浙江全省共八十一个县、市，四九一个区。伪国民党地政局清丈勘测完竣的有十二个县、七十一个区；已经清丈但未完成的有二十五个县，一六三个区；未清丈过的有四十四个县，二五七个区。我们首先研究不同地区旧土地材料的种类，内容及历史是否完整，然后根据现有的主要材料及当地群众条件与工作基础，在不同地区，提出不同的整理土地的方法和步骤。截至九月底止，全省除个别匪情严重的地区外，土地整理工作已基本完成。据绍兴专区的统计，整理土地后，土地面积一般比去年增加百分之二十至四十，个别地区比去年增加百分之六十九。这就为贯彻执行新区农业税法打下了良好基础。
    经验证明：充分运用旧材料，适当运用旧人员（并可吸取知识青年，小学教员，荣退军人等参加），并发动群众校对检举，是整理新区土地的有效方法。这样不但便于及时弄清土地面积，而且可以避免混乱。开始时，有的专区或县，过份强调旧材料的缺点和复杂难用，总想搬用老区经验，如发动群众陈报、插标等，结果劳民伤财，得不到应有的效果。经验也证明：旧材料是有缺点的，而且缺点很多。但只要自觉的运用，而不是盲目的搬用，便不怕它有缺点。旧材料的地亩也是不准确的（如浙江未经过测量的地区，地亩真实性一般只达七八成，个别地区只有五六成。长兴县旧材料一般是田八折，地七折，山五折），但只要经过调查研究，掌握了它与实际数目的差额或比例，便可做到“心中有数”。正因为旧材料有缺点，不准确，才须要加以整理，并发动群众加以校对，这比盲目的毫无材料的去发动群众自报反黑田要稳妥捷便得多。当然，运用旧材料而不改造旧材料，盲目的信任其准确性，也是错误的。
    （二）定好产量
    关系执行政策和完成任务最大的一环，除了弄清土地面积外，便是土地的常年应产量。产量是比土地面积更难掌握而又具有更多机动性的问题。因此，定好产量便成为今年秋征能否做好的关键。浙江是从两方面着手解决这个问题的。
    第一是解决定产方法问题
    开始存在着两种不同的方法：一种是搬用老区的“民主评议”与“自报公议”的方法，这种方法已证明在新区行不通；另一种是“分片评等，分类折合，调查定产，结合评议”的方法，这是在实验中摸索出来的方法。经验证明：这是合于新区条件，简易可行而又易于收效的方法。
    为什么“民主评议”“自报公议”在新区行不通呢？定产工作是决定每一农户对国家缴纳多少农业税的问题，一般的规律是：群众觉悟程度高，又有坚强领导的地区，产量便评的公平合理接近实际。在一般地区，“村本位”的现象一时难以克服，形成老实的吃亏，滑头的沾光、畸轻畸重、难以公道。有些地区曾经搬用老区经验，结果积极分子脱离群众，干部与群众对立，群众往下拉，干部往上抬。时间拖了很长，产量并未评好，群众也不满意。
    什么是“分片评等、分类折合，调查定产，结合评议”的方法呢？
    “分片评等”就是把土质相同的田地分成若干片，让群众评议各片间的差额，只评等级，不评产量。片不宜过大，也不宜过小，过小则是“满天星”，花费群众很多工夫，且容易使经营好的户吃亏，经营差的户讨好。过大则不摸边，且会造成片内“坏地吃亏，好地沾光”。
    “分类折合”就是把占主体的田、地以外的山、荡，按不同产量分出几类，评出与田、地的折合比例。如当地一般土地为水田，即评出当地几亩山地或杂地，折合一亩水田；如当地一般土地为旱地，则将其他土地评出与它的折合比率。有的地区，群众愿把田、地、山、荡，各用分片评等或分类评等的方法，而不用分类折合，这要看各地具体条件及情况而定，以简易合理为原则。
    “调查定产”就是政府（可协同积极分子，农民代表，生产劳模等）按群众分片评等的材料，进行深入的调查研究，求出各片各等各类的产量。即是根据调查来定产。调查定产时，也不需要到每片每等中去定。根据常山县的经验，最简便而又较正确的方法，是在每区中找出一个具有代表性的片（或乡村）和一般片（或乡村）作比较，只要将这个具有代表性的片定的切合实际，公平合理，作为标准，就能够根据各片、等、类的差额，推算其他片、等、类的产量。这样，乡与乡，区与区之间的产量易于平衡一致，群众也容易接受。把这个具有代表性的片的产量定好并非难事，重要的在向群众学习。如：衢州召开区长会议，对定产问题，谁也说不出实际情况，结果把产量拉低很多。一个出席全国劳模会议的代表，一口气把全县各个片的产量说了出来，使大家哑口无言，不能不承认这是合乎实际的。常山县召开区长会议，每个区找了几个老年农民，定出了全县产量草案，拿回各区去对照，农民一致认为公平合理，很少变动。这种作法既切合实际，又节省时间。其关键在于调查研究，掌握材料，实事求是。（旧的科则等级和地价，也是定产中重要的参考资料不可忽视。）
    “结合评议”就是将政府调查定产的方案，经过乡农民代表会讨论通过，对个别不适当的地方加以修正，然后把这个切合实际公平合理的定产贯彻到群众中去。自上而下的调查定产和自下而上的讨论修正必须密切结合，不能彼此孤立，否则便会形成“派产”。特别是山区或土质比较复杂的地区，田地分散，土质不一，产量悬殊，面积也不一致，同片中产量特高特低的情形是难免的，必须结合评议加以个别的必要的修正。根据常山县的经验，召开农代会，总结生产，评功选模，深入发动群众，进行生产教育，并通过定产，这是最好的方法。群众会从人民政府一年来领导生产的成绩中，懂得定产也是为了生产。如绍兴专区上虞县崧厦区的代表说：“本来认为政府向阿拉要东西总是不好的，现在才懂得征粮是穷人翻身的资本”。江东区九江庙村有三本田亩册，去年交出了一本（最不正确的），土整时交出了第二本（也是不正确的），而在农代会明白了定产意义征粮办法后，为了负担合理及将来进行土改，即交出了第三本（确实的）。
    这一新的方法，是用评等、分类、调查定产的方法从群众中来，再结合评议回到群众中去；凡是评等分类、调查定产以合乎实际，又经过充分酝酿，结合评议作了个别修正的，不仅可以顺利通过，而且很快会为群众所接受，认为这样是比较公平合理的。
    第二是解决定产思想问题
    浙江全省从十月初全面进入定产工作，为了定好产量，必须解决定产思想上的偏差，首先是干部思想上的偏差。这些思想偏差，据初步了解，主要的是：
    一，富庶地区根据典型乡的试算，按实际产量依率计征的结果，可以超出任务，因此，便产生了压低产量，“凑合完成任务”的思想。贫瘠地区，按实际产量依率计征，不能全部完成任务，也有想把产量提高一些的偏向。
    二，“税率就是任务”，有些人认为产量定低些，任务就小些，便于完成任务。
    三，认为把产量定高了，是破坏了政策。而把产量定低了，顶多是影响完成任务，对执行政策就没有毛病。
    四，认为产量定低些，好向群众讲话，干群关系容易搞好。
    五，认为去年征粮要地主多负担，（其实尾欠仍然很大）今年要政府吃点亏吧。干部在整风后，对于执行政策，对于群众观点有了明显的转变。但在定产上，在区乡干部中表现了尾巴主义的偏向。因此，“必须反对不顾政策，单纯完成任务的偏向，同时也要防止强调困难，放任自流的偏向”（政务院关于新解放区征收农业税的指示）。经验证明：端正思想，实事求是，按条例办事，是定好产量，正确贯彻合理负担政策的首要一环。
    （三）结合减租
    只弄清了人口，土地，产量，而没有议定租额，对于有租佃关系的户的负担额，还是不好计算的。因此，第三步便是减租结合征粮，将业佃分租成数定下来，以便及时计算租佃负担。浙江有些县以县或区为单位；召集业佃双方（每村选一佃户代表，每乡选一业主代表）到县议租，其好处是：使议租工作从分散繁复走向集中简便，既能按政策法令办事，又能使那些顽抗的地主无技可使；既解决农民的减租要求，又解除地主怕农民不交租，怕农民降低议租产量的顾虑。同时也便于及时过拨和造册计算负担。在会上，对业主要讲通加二减二（即出租收入一百斤作一百二十斤计算）的道理，说明这不仅是合理的，而且含有鼓励劳动生产的意义。对佃户要讲通今年减租不仅要使地主够交负担，而且使其够生活，否则对农民也是不利的。要做好一个基点乡的议租试验，以便吸取经验，解决租佃双方负担上的具体问题。如农业税常年应产量和议租产量的关系，大小业主的负担问题，轮租地负担，地主不好归户的负担等。谨慎而正确地解决租佃负担问题是贯彻政策和保证任务很重要的一环。这是不能马虎的。
    （四）归户造串
    人口、地亩、产量，租佃问题搞清以后，即开始归户、造册、造串（即填发纳税通知书），结合调查评议（计算核对和评议减免），动员群众集体缴粮。这是征粮准备工作的结束，也是征粮行动的开始。
    为保证依率计征，克服分配任务的盲目性，浙江省今年一般采取集中在县进行归户造册计算负担的办法。聘请助征人员，采取负责制度，即几个人负责几个乡的计算造册工作，从始至终负责到底。
    乡（村）组织包括各阶层代表在内的乡农业税调查评议委员会。其主要任务一是按县政府所造各乡征收清册，公布每户应交税额，并告诉各户这个数字是怎样计算出来的，发动群众核对是否合于他的人口、土地、产量、租佃关系的情况。二是评议减免（包括灾情减免和烈军工属孤寡老弱特殊困难户的照顾）。经核对无误、评议减免、报县批准后，即造串缴粮，并订立缴粮计划，检查粮质，为“缴快，缴好，缴足”，开展群众性的集体缴粮运动。在这里，及时揭破反动地主和特务的谣言，镇压其破坏活动，是十分重要不容忽视的。
    （五）集体缴粮
    做好了以上的各项准备工作，并且做得充分成熟了，就具备了开展集体缴粮运动的条件。根据金华若干征粮重点乡的经验，只要做好了准备，一个乡的缴粮工作，在三四天内即可全部顺利完成。在这里，仓库的准备（内部组织健全，入库计划严密，做到计划准确，手续清楚，接收迅速，秩序良好，解报及时），特别是正确解释清理去年尾欠问题，打破带头吃亏的顾虑（去年浙江征粮中地主尾欠尚多，群众批评我们：“先交的挨打，迟交的挨骂，不交的便罢。”），是开展集体缴粮运动的关键。
    浙江全省现正进入定产议租归户造串的紧张阶段，至十月下旬各县做好一个乡（或区）的缴粮示范，十一月份全面开征。假如各县能按照省府指示的准备工作认真做好，那么，可以相信，全省便能在十一月底有秩序的按照中央农业税法完成征粮任务。
