　　A Suggestion
　　Wang Xi
　　Recently, a great education about the Chinese People's Revolutionary War is being conducted in Beijing. This education is unfolding in three aspects: first, the various reports from the National Combat Heroes Representative Meeting; second, the Exhibition of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; and third, the screening of the film "The Victory of the Chinese People." It educates the Chinese people from three aspects: the typical heroic figures, battles, and achievements in the Chinese People's Revolution of more than 20 years. The victory of the Chinese revolution was achieved under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, through long-term arduous struggle and countless bloodshed and sacrifices. How should we strive to consolidate and develop this great victory in the future! This education is very important. Under the current situation of American imperialism carrying out aggressive wars in Asia, we should use the education of the revolutionary war to arouse the vigilance of the people nationwide and strengthen the building of national defense and economic power. Therefore, I suggest that the organizations, schools, troops, and people's groups in Beijing should take this opportunity to conduct an organized education. In addition to having read the reports of the combat heroes and held reports meetings of combat heroes, they should also have an organized visit to the People's Liberation Army Exhibition and watch the film "The Victory of the Chinese People." After watching it, organize discussions, and provide explanations when there are questions, so that it becomes a learning movement.

　　一个建议
    王西
    最近在北京进行着一个关于中国人民革命战争的伟大教育，这个教育是分三方面展开的：一是全国的战斗英雄代表会的各种报导，二是中国人民解放军展览会，三是电影《中国人民的胜利》的放映。从二十余年来中国人民革命中的典型的英雄人物、战斗及战绩三方面来教育中国人民。中国革命的胜利是在毛主席的英明领导下，经过长期的艰苦斗争，无数的流血牺牲，才得来的。我们今后要如何努力来巩固和发展这一伟大的胜利！这一教育是非常重要的。在目前美帝国主义在亚洲进行侵略战争的形势下，我们应该以革命战争的教育来引起全国人民的警惕，和加强国防力量和经济力量的建设。因此，我建议在北京市的机关、学校、部队、和人民团体中，应该利用这个机会有组织地进行一次教育，除了已经阅读了战斗英雄的报导和进行了战斗英雄的报告会外，还应该有组织的参观人民解放军展览会和看《中国人民的胜利》的影片。看了之后，并组织讨论，有问题时并进行讲解，使其成为一学习运动。
