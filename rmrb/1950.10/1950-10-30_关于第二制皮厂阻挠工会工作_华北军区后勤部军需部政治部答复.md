Reply from the Political Department of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region's Quartermaster Department Regarding the Second Leather Factory Obstructing Union Work

To the Editors:

　　After the "People's Garden" published the article "The Second Leather Factory of the Quartermaster Department of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region Should Not Obstruct Workers from Organizing a Trade Union" on September 13th, Comrade Zi Jianhou, Deputy Minister of our department, and others, cooperated with local party and government organs to investigate and deal with the matter. After extensive investigation, we found that the criticism in the newspaper was basically correct (individual issues differed from the facts).

This error should be the responsibility of the leaders of our department and the responsible comrades of the Industrial Management Office directly leading the factory. We considered the factory a temporary factory that "disbands after finishing the leather garments," and therefore lacked in-depth inspections of the factory's cadre deployment, production situation, and work guidance. On the issue of establishing a trade union, Director Zhang of the Industrial Management Office simply and vaguely said, "It should not be prevented; if they want to establish it, then let them establish it!" When someone requested the addition of medical personnel, Factory Director Li said, "Adding three medical personnel would cost over 10,000 catties of millet per month. It wouldn't cost that much to hire a doctor when someone gets sick." This fully demonstrates that the leading cadres of the factory only have a singular focus on production tasks and thrift, and do not care about the welfare of the workers.

The cadres of the factory lacked a policy perspective and did not understand that a factory can only be run well by relying on the masses of workers. Gao Ao, the head of the Works Section, had an old-fashioned mindset and mistakenly believed that "tasks can be completed just the same without a trade union." His work style was also extremely poor, frequently scolding workers, treating union and newspaper cadres rudely, and illegally dismissing Comrade Chen Guoshun, who had just been elected as the chairman of the trade union preparatory committee. Li Huaxuan, the factory director, believed that the leather factory was seasonal and the workers were not fixed, and that establishing a trade union would cause trouble. He also failed to adequately address factory labor protection and sanitation facilities, and deducted workers' water money and holiday meal allowances, and did not pay workers according to the government's stipulated wage and rice prices. This is a work style that is detached from the masses.

Based on the above situation, we have decided: to give Gao Ao, who committed serious mistakes, a penalty of removal from his position and to transfer him to the department for introspection; to give Li Huaxuan criticism and education. In addition, we have ordered the responsible cadres of the department and office to conduct self-criticism.

Currently, in addition to ordering the factory to immediately fulfill the workers' demands and actively assist the work of the trade union, we have also decided to establish close relationships with local Party and government organs to supervise the work of the factory.

### 关于第二制皮厂阻挠工会工作  华北军区后勤部军需部政治部答复

　　关于第二制皮厂阻挠工会工作
    华北军区后勤部军需部政治部答复编辑同志：
    九月十三日人民园地发表了“华北军区后勤部军需部第二制皮厂不该阻挠工人组织工会”一文以后，本部副部长资建候同志等会协同当地党政机关调查处理。经我们多方了解，报纸的批评基本上是正确的（个别问题与事实有出入）。
    这个错误应由我们部的领导及直接领导该厂的工管处负责同志负责。我们认为该厂是一个“做完皮衣就散伙”的临时厂，因此对该厂干部配备、生产情况的了解、工作指导，缺乏深入检查。在成立工会问题上，工管处张处长仅简单而含糊地说：“不应阻止，要成立就成立吧！”有人要求增设医务人员时，李厂长说：“增设三个医务人员，每月需开支费万余斤小米，有了病请个医生也花不了这么多钱。”这充分表现了该厂领导干部在生产上有单纯的任务、节约观点，不去关心工人群众的福利事业。
    该厂干部缺乏政策观点，不了解只有依靠工人群众才能办好工厂。工务股长高鏖同志思想守旧，错误地认为“没有工会也一样能完成任务”；在工作作风上亦极恶劣，经常谩骂工人，蛮横地对待工会及报社干部，并非法开除了刚被选为工会筹委主任的陈国顺同志。该厂厂长李化轩，认为皮厂是季节性的，工人又不固定，成立了工会会发生麻烦。对工厂劳动保护、卫生设备亦不予适当解决，且克扣工人水钱、休假伙食费，不按政府规定的工资米价发给工人。这是脱离群众的作风。
    根据以上情况，我们决定：对犯严重错误的高鏖，给以撤职处分，并调部反省；给李化轩以批评教育。此外，令部、处负责干部作自我检讨。
    目前，我们除责成该厂立即履行工人的要求和主动帮助工会工作外，并决定与当地党、政机关建立密切的关系，以监督该厂的工作。
