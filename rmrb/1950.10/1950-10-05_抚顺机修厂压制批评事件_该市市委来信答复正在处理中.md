　　Fushun Machine Repair Factory Suppresses Criticism Incident
    The City Party Committee Replies by Letter that It Is Being Handled
    To the Editor:
    We have read and studied in detail the manuscript written by reporter Lu Bo and the newspaper's short commentary published in the People's Forum; we have also received the newspaper clippings sent to the Municipal Party Committee. We have shortcomings in handling this issue and are currently conducting a self-criticism.

    Currently, incidents of suppressing criticism have continuously occurred at the Machine Repair Factory. The factory has many problems. The Municipal Party Committee is examining its work and handling the above issues. Once the problems are clarified, we will send you the self-criticism and the handling results together. We are sending this letter in advance.
    With respectful greetings,
              Fushun Municipal Party Committee
              September 29th

　　抚顺机修厂压制批评事件
    该市市委来信答复正在处理中
    编者同志：
    人民园地发表的记者鲁渤所写的信稿及报纸短评，我们已详细阅读并作了研究；给市委的剪报亦已收到。在该问题的处理上，我们是有缺点的。现正在检讨中。
    现在机修厂连续发生压制批评的事情。该厂问题很多。市委正检查其工作，并正处理以上问题。待把问题弄清楚后，即将检讨与处理结果一块寄给你们。谨先函奉。
    此致敬礼
              抚顺市委会
