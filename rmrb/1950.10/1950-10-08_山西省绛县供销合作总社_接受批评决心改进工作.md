To the Editor:

    We have read the letter from Comrade Guo Ruiyi criticizing our cooperative, published in the People’s Garden on September 1st. We are now submitting our self-criticism to you.

    The problems arose mainly due to the bureaucratic work style of the county cooperative's leadership. Since the establishment of our cooperative, cotton has been stolen three times, cloth once, and money twice, with a total loss equivalent to 8,376 jin of millet. After these thefts occurred, we did not seriously investigate or take appropriate measures, always stopping at meetings, research, telephone calls, and notifications. For example, in mid-March of this year, the Second District Cooperative was robbed of more than 1,900 chi of various colored cloths. At that time, the county cooperative considered that there might be internal problems and planned to rectify the internal affairs, but later dropped the matter.

    Another example is the theft of 500,000 yuan from the Fourth District Cooperative. The county cooperative did not send anyone to investigate and deal with it, simply saying that it would be investigated. As a result, the matter ended without resolution.

    The situation with the iron and wood factory manufacturing wooden shovels and sickles is similar. Although the county cooperative leadership had given instructions several times, it did not delve into the factory for specific guidance and inspection. As a result, more than a thousand wooden shovels and sickles were substandard and could not be sold, causing dissatisfaction among the cooperative members.

    These problems reflect how irresponsible we are towards the property of the state and cooperative members. Our work only involves making arrangements, lacking inspection. We sincerely admit our mistakes and firmly remember these lessons. We are now starting to rectify the internal affairs of the organization and its units, and are preparing to formulate work plans and systems to improve our work.

            Jiang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Shanxi Province

### 山西省绛县供销合作总社  接受批评决心改进工作

　　山西省绛县供销合作总社
    接受批评决心改进工作编者同志：
    九月一日人民园地上发表的郭锐毅同志批评本社的信，我们已读到了。现将我们的检讨告诉你们。
    问题之所以产生，主要是由于县社领导的官僚主义作风。我社自建社以来，棉花被窃三次，布匹被窃一次，丢款二次，损失总值共计小米八千三百七十六斤。这些失盗事情发生后，我们并未认真追究，也未采取适当的措施，总是停留在会议、研究、电话、通知上面。如本年三月中旬，二区社被窃去各色布匹一千九百余尺，县社当时考虑可能内部有问题，计划整顿内部，但是以后即把此事放下了。
    又如四区社被窃去五十万元，县社没派人去调查处理，光说要追查。结果以不了了之。
    铁木厂制造木锨、麦镰亦是如此。县社领导上虽然曾指示过几次，但没深入到厂内具体指导与检查。结果，千余张木锨、麦镰不合规格，售不出去，并引起社员群众对我们的不满。
    这些问题反映了我们对国家与社员财产是何等的不负责任，工作只有布置，缺乏检查。我们诚恳地承认错误，并牢牢记着这些教训。我们现正着手整顿机关内部与各单位，并准备制定工作计划与制度，借以改进工作。
