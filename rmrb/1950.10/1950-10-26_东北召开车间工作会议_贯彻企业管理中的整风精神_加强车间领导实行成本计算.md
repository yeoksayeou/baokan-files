　　Northeast Convenes Workshop Conference
    Implement Rectification Spirit in Enterprise Management
    Strengthen Workshop Leadership to Implement Cost Accounting
    [This newspaper reports] In order to further improve the operation and management of enterprises, the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government studied the current situation of enterprises and believes that strengthening workshop (pithead) work and workshop (pithead) leadership is one of the important steps to improve enterprise operation and management at present.
    On August 24, the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government issued a decision to strengthen workshop work, requiring all bureaus, companies, factories, and mines to focus on summarizing the experience of existing advanced workshop (pithead) work, or start from one workshop and one pithead to implement cost accounting for workshops or pitheads, do a good job in the technical management of workshops and pitheads, and gradually promote it to other workshops or pitheads.
    On September 25, the department convened a workshop conference with about 600 people, including the heads of various administrative bureaus and the factory directors and mine managers of the Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, and Benxi regions, as well as the main workshop directors or pithead directors of each factory and mine. Northeast advanced workshop leaders such as Chen Yucai, director of the assembly workshop of the Fifth Machine Factory, Shang Ke, director of the foundry branch of the Second Machine Factory, and Yu Yefu, director of the copper electrolysis plant of the Shenyang Smelter, all made typical reports. Comrade Qiu Chunfu, director of the Northeast Industry Department Office, made a special report on workshop work, and An Zhiwen, deputy minister of the department, made a summary, pointing out a clear direction for workshop work.
    Strengthening the leadership of workshop work is one of the important steps to improve the operation and management of enterprises. Because one of the main difficulties in the leadership of factories and mines in the Northeast at present is that some work systems cannot be truly implemented in the workshops, resulting in the prescribed systems becoming a formality. Taking enterprise cost management as an example, the most serious problem at present is the disconnection between planned costs and actual costs. The reason is that the sub-department quota work in the workshop has not been done well, and the original records in the workshop are inaccurate. Taking technical management as an example, in the past, there was only a finished product inspection system, but there was a lack of specific operating procedures in the workshop, or there were workshop operating procedures but a lack of semi-finished product and component inspection systems in the workshop, making it impossible to guarantee the improvement of product quality.
    The content of strengthening workshop work should include the following three points: (1) Strengthen the technical management of the workshop, including reviewing the technical operating procedures of each work section, formulating the technical standards and quality standards of semi-finished products in each work section, strictly implementing the independent inspection system of products, the maintenance system of mechanical equipment, the inspection of raw materials, and the work regulations of workshop technicians, etc. (2) Calculate workshop costs, including formulating reasonable departmental quotas, accurate and timely original records, trying out workshop vouchers, and purchasing materials from the material section with the material section's vouchers according to the approved workshop budget to strengthen workshop cash management. Under the conditions already in place, start promoting workshop accounting. When it is impossible to calculate costs on a workshop basis for the time being, actively improve workshop leadership, prepare conditions, and gradually implement it. (3) Implement the workshop director responsibility system based on democratic management, making the workshop director the full leader of the workshop. The workshop director is directly led by the factory director, and the various departments in the factory have a business guidance relationship with the workshop director and should assist the workshop director in completing the production plan. The workshop director should be proficient in technology, learn to manage the economy, and should master the plan, and be directly responsible for whether the plan is completed or not.
    The experience of advanced workshops such as Chen Yucai, Yu Yefu, and Shang Ke proves that advanced workshops can not only improve labor productivity and product quality, but also begin to raise new problems and create new experiences in technical management, cost management, and the organization and leadership of production. Therefore, strengthening workshop leadership is a higher step in the development of the Northeast new record movement from the basis of Zhao Guoyou's advanced producers and Ma Hengchang's advanced production groups to collective creation of new records. The Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government calls for a widespread movement to "create advanced workshops" and "learn from advanced workshops" to continuously enrich the experience of workshop work.

### 东北召开车间工作会议  贯彻企业管理中的整风精神  加强车间领导实行成本计算

　　东北召开车间工作会议
    贯彻企业管理中的整风精神 
    加强车间领导实行成本计算
    【本报讯】东北人民政府工业部为进一步改进企业的经营管理，研究了当前企业的情况，认为加强车间（坑口）工作和车间（坑口）领导，是目前改善企业经营管理的重要步骤之一。
    八月二十四日东北人民政府工业部发布了加强车间工作的决定，要求各局、公司、厂、矿应有重点的总结已有先进车间（坑口）工作的经验，或首先从一个车间一个坑口开始实行车间或坑口的成本核算，搞好车间坑口的技术管理，并逐步推广到其他车间或坑口。
    九月二十五日，该部召开了各管理总局负责人及所属沈阳、鞍山、抚顺、本溪地区厂矿长及每个工厂矿山的主要车间主任或坑口主任共约六百余人的车间工作会议。东北先进车间负责人如第五机器厂装配车间主任陈毓材，第二机器厂翻砂分场主任尚可，沈阳冶炼厂铜电解场主任于冶夫都做了典型报告。东北工业部办公室主任邱纯甫同志做了关于车间工作的专题报告，该部副部长安志文做了总结，给车间工作指出一明确的方向。
    加强车间工作的领导，是改善企业经营管理的重要步骤之一。因为目前东北各厂矿领导上的主要困难之一，是有些工作制度不能真正贯彻到车间，结果使规定的制度陷于形式。以企业的成本管理为例，目前最严重的毛病是计划成本和实际成本脱节，原因就是车间的分部定额工作没作好，车间的原始记录不准确。再以技术管理为例，过去仅有成品检验制度，而缺乏车间具体的操作规程，或是有了车间操作规程而缺乏车间的半成品和部件的检验制度，使产品质量的提高得不到保证。
    加强车间工作的内容应包括下列三点：（一）加强车间的技术管理，这包括审定各个工段技术操作规程，制定各个工段半成品的技术标准和质量标准，严格执行产品的独立检查制度，机械设备的检修制度，原材料的检定及车间技术人员的工作条例等。（二）计算车间成本，包括制定合理的分部定额、正确及时的原始记录，试用车间本票，按照批准的车间预算，以材料课的本票向材料课购买材料，以加强车间现金管理。在已具备条件的情况下，开始推行车间核算。一时不能以车间为单位计算成本时，应积极改进车间领导，准备条件，逐步实行。（三）实行在民主管理基础上的车间主任负责制，使车间主任成为车间的全权领导者。车间主任直接由厂长领导，厂内各科对车间主任是业务上的指导关系，应协助车间主任完成生产计划。车间主任应精通技术，学会管理经济，并应掌握计划，对计划的完成与否负直接责任。
    从陈毓材，于冶夫、尚可等先进车间经验证明，先进车间不仅可以提高劳动生产率和产品质量，而且开始在技术管理，成本管理和生产的组织领导方面，提出了新的问题，创造了新的经验。因此，加强车间领导工作，是东北新纪录运动从赵国有先进生产者、马恒昌先进生产小组的基础上，向集体创造新纪录更高一步的发展。东北人民政府工业部号召普遍展开一个“创造先进车间”和“学习先进车间”的运动，以此来不断充实车间工作的经验。
