Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 25th: The public security organs in Yingkou, Shenyang, and Benxi cities in Northeast China have successively uncovered two major spy cases: the "Liaohai Special Work Zone" and the "China International Third Party, Third Branch Bureau." All 44 criminals in the two cases have been arrested, and the masterminds Wang Taijiu, Li Ji, and 15 others have been sentenced to death; secondary elements have been sentenced to prison terms.

The chief criminal of the "Liaohai Special Work Zone" spy organization, Wang Taijiu, joined the Kuomintang's Three People's Principles Youth Salvation Corps in 1945 and served as the director of the Yingkou office of the "Sweeping Briefing" agency in 1947, engaging in underground activities. He began actively developing the organization in June 1949, formulating "Work Outlines" and dividing the sabotage activities into three stages: "cultivation, pre-action, and action," to systematically prepare forces. At the same time, he formulated "Intelligence Investigation Outlines" to collect information on our military, government, factories, and enterprises. After the outbreak of the American imperialist war of aggression against Korea, the criminal believed that "the cultivation stage had passed, and the pre-action stage had arrived," and formally renamed the spy organization the "Liaohai Special Work Zone." He successively issued multiple "appointment orders" and "secret orders," proposing and formulating "Armed Construction Plans" and "Military Construction Plans," dividing all bandits into 15 groups, attempting to carry out various sabotage activities in Yingkou, and preparing to organize a "Party-Government Salvation Army Underground Team," plotting to win over bandit armed forces, and dreaming of "cooperating" with the Kuomintang's "landing counterattack." After detailed investigation by our local public security organs, Wang's underground activities were uncovered in one fell swoop. The main criminals of the spy organization were captured: "Chairman of the Liaohai Special Work Zone" Wang Taijiu, "Secretary-General of the Headquarters" Zhou Changding, "Chief of Staff of the Chairman" Liu Changfu, "Advisors" Wang Huaigong and Guo Youyu, "Commanders" Xu Zhenqi and Liang Weiqin, "Captain of the Party-Government Salvation Army Underground Team" Yu Taichang, and 25 accomplices. After detailed interrogation, the city's People's Court has sentenced eight of the main criminals, including Wang, to death.

The "China International Third Party, Third Branch Bureau" spy organization, which carried out sabotage activities underground in Shenyang, was completely uncovered by the public security organs of Shenyang and Benxi cities. Nineteen criminals, including the ringleader Li Ji and key criminals Bi Kezhen, Yu Zhen, and Feng Minzhi, were arrested, and many pieces of evidence such as pistols and forged seals were seized. Li and others were professional spies raised by the Kuomintang for many years. They engaged in underground activities in Shenyang, recruiting Kuomintang stragglers and using the "Justice Society" as an external organization to collect intelligence, steal documents, spread rumors, and carry out other sabotage activities. The characteristics of the criminals' activities were: forging seals, letters of introduction, employee certificates, passports, etc., of our organizations, and stealing the badges of our organizations and enterprise companies, impersonating cadres of our enterprise departments, even openly wearing cadre uniforms and carrying pistols to carry out activities. The criminals also used various relationships to infiltrate our organizations and enterprises, using their occupations as cover for sabotage. After detailed interrogation of the arrested criminals by our public security organs, they were handed over to the Shenyang People's Court for sentencing. The main criminals Li Ji, Yu Zhen, Bi Kezhen, Li Tingxun, Zhang Guochang, Feng Minzhi, Qiu Guangfan, Wu Huaiqing, and others have been executed by firing squad.

    潜伏沈市进行破坏活动的“中国国际第三党第三支局”特务组织，经我沈阳、本溪两市公安机关全部破获。匪首李季及要犯毕克尘、虞镇、冯敏之等十九人均被捕获，缴获手枪、伪造印信等证物甚多。李犯等均为蒋匪多年豢养的职业特务，在沈阳市潜伏活动，招收蒋匪流散人员，以“正义学会”为外围组织，进行搜集情报、窃取文件、造谣等破坏活动。匪等活动特点是：伪造我机关印鉴、介绍信、职员证、护照等，并窃取我机关及企业公司的证章，冒充我企业部门干部，甚至公开穿干部制服，佩带手枪，进行活动。该犯等并利用各种关系，打入我机关、企业内部，以职业掩护，从事破坏。我公安机关对捕获各犯详予审讯后，交由沈市人民法院判处，主犯李季、虞镇、毕克尘、李廷勋、张国长、冯敏之、邱广范、吴怀庆等已执行枪决。
