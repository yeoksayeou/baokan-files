　　Turning Grief into Strength
    ——In Memory of Comrade Ren Bishi
    Tan Zhenlin
    Just as American imperialism is expanding its war of aggression in Korea, our dearest comrade-in-arms, Comrade Ren Bishi, has passed away. What a great loss this is! Comrade Bishi was a defender of the Chinese people, one of the brilliant commanders and leaders who secured victory in the Chinese People's Liberation War, a mentor of the Chinese youth movement, and a guardian of Marxism-Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought. He resolutely opposed Chen Duxiu's betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and defended the banner of the Chinese revolution. He resolutely opposed the traitor Zhang Guotao, defended the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and completed the joining of the Red Army forces. He was a staunch leader and commander in opposing Chiang Kai-shek's five "encirclement and suppression" campaigns and implementing the Long March policy of the Red Army. He waged a resolute and unyielding struggle in the enemy's court of interrogation. The passing of such a steel-like defender of the Chinese people, a mentor of Chinese youth, is an irreparable loss to the Chinese people. It fills us with immense grief!
    Comrades, wipe away your tears! Turn our grief into strength, into the same unwavering determination as Comrade Bishi, forming an iron Mount Tai, so that the American imperialists will commit suicide before this Mount Tai! Comrade Bishi is dead, but he has left behind a strong will and a spirit of heroic struggle. This is boundless strength. This is the strength to unite the people of the whole country to form an iron Mount Tai. We inherit Comrade Bishi's will and spirit, and clench our fists. If the American imperialists dare to infringe upon our country's security, to encroach upon the cause that Comrade Bishi created for the Chinese people, then we will use the immense power of an iron Mount Tai to give them a crushing blow, just as we struck down Japanese imperialism, so that they will never be able to recover! Comrade Bishi, rest in peace! We will surely be able to inherit your spirit, your will; we will surely be able to repel and defeat any aggressor, until we finally eliminate them, defend the integrity of Chinese territory, defend the security of the country, defend the cause you have accomplished; until we realize your ideals, and transform China into a powerful, modern, industrialized socialist and communist country.

　　化悲痛为力量
    ——悼念任弼时同志
    谭震林
    正当美帝国主义在朝鲜扩大侵略战争的时候，我们最亲爱的战友，任弼时同志逝世了。这是多么大的损失啊！弼时同志是中国人民的保卫者，是中国人民解放战争获取胜利的英明指挥与领导者之一，是中国青年运动的导师，是马列主义——毛泽东思想的卫士。他曾坚决地反对了陈独秀叛变马列主义，保卫了中国革命的旗帜。他曾坚决地反对了叛徒张国焘，保卫了毛泽东思想的胜利，完成了红军会师。他是在反对蒋介石五次“围剿”，实现红军长征政策的一个坚强领导者与指挥者。他在敌人的法庭上刑询中，作过了坚决不屈的斗争。这样的像钢铁般的中国人民的卫士，中国青年的导师逝世了，这是中国人民一个无可补价的损失。使我们万分的悲痛！
    同志们，揩干眼泪吧！把我们的悲痛化为力量，化为像弼时同志一样的刚强坚定，形成一座铁的泰山，让美帝国主义者在这座泰山前自杀吧！弼时同志死了，他留下了坚强的意志，英勇奋斗的精神。这是无限的力量。这是团结全国人民形成一座钢铁泰山的力量。我们继承着弼时同志的意志与精神，紧握我们的拳头。如果美帝国主义者要求侵犯我国的安全，侵害弼时同志为中国人民作好的事业，那么，我们就以钢铁泰山般的巨力，给它以粉碎的打击，像打击日本帝国主义一样，使他永远不能翻身！弼时同志，你放心安眠吧！我们一定能够继承着你的精神，你的意志；我们一定能够把任何侵略者打退、打败，一直到最后消灭它，保卫中国领土的完整，保卫国家的安全，保卫你已完成的事业；一直到实现你的理想，把中国变成一个强大的、现代化的、工业化的社会主义、共产主义的国家。
