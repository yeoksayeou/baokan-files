　　Central Academy of Fine Arts, Yanjing University, and Other Schools
　　Invite Hero and Model Representatives to Give Reports
　　[This Newspaper] In recent days, hero and model representatives have been giving lectures at various schools in Beijing, providing great encouragement to the students.

　　On the 4th and 6th, the entire faculty, students, staff, and police of the Central Academy of Fine Arts listened to reports from combat heroes Wei Laiguo, Peng Yanxue, Li Dianbing, Tian Guangwen, Liu Hucheng, and labor models Zhao Zhankui, Zhao Guilan, Li Yong, Li Fenglian, Zhao Guoyou, Zhang Shuyi, and Li Shunda. President Xu Beihong called on the entire faculty, students, staff, and police of the academy to learn from the heroes and models, and to fully utilize the art of modeling to depict and promote their heroic achievements. Deputy Dean of Academic Affairs Wang Chaowen specifically pointed out that the deeds of the heroes and models are beautiful narrative poems, novels, and comic strips, because the deeds themselves are full of persuasive power and have high artistic value. After the two lecture sessions, the students invited the heroes and models to participate in group discussions, so that a more intimate and complete picture of the heroes and models was imprinted in the minds of the students.

　　Over one thousand faculty, students, staff, and affiliated high school students of Yanjing University invited labor models Li Fenglian and Yu Zhendan to the school on the 5th to give reports. After the reports, the students surrounded the two labor models, shook hands with them, asked them to sign their names, and eagerly looked at the circular slide rule created by Yu Zhendan. The students enthusiastically said, "We must learn from the labor models' infinite loyalty to the motherland and the people, and their selfless work spirit."

　　On the 5th, the Beijing Third District Committee of the Communist Youth League invited combat heroes Lü Junsheng, Chai Xuejiu, and Jiang Rongguang to give reports to the League members, Young Pioneers, and students of the Third Branch of the Teachers College Affiliated High School. Students from the Fourth Branch of the Teachers College Affiliated High School and other schools also heard lectures from combat heroes Lu Xiangshi and Liu Kuiji at the Sixth Middle School on the afternoon of the 5th. The students presented bouquets of flowers to the heroes, expressing their respect. Hong Bin and Cao Zhanma, students from the Fourth Branch of the Teachers College Affiliated High School, both said, "We must honestly learn the spirit of the heroes who work for the people."

　　中央美术学院和燕大等校
    邀请英模代表作报告
    【本报讯】英雄模范代表们连日到京市各校讲演，给各校同学以极大的鼓励。
    中央美术学院全院师生工警，于四、六两日分别听取了战斗英雄魏来国、彭彦雪、李殿冰、田广文、刘虎成和劳动模范赵占魁、赵桂兰、李永、李凤莲、赵国有、张树义、李顺达等人的报告。徐悲鸿院长号召全院师生工警向英模们学习，并要充分利用造型艺术，来描绘和宣扬英模们的丰功伟绩。王朝闻副教务长更具体地指出了英模们的事迹就是优美的叙事诗、小说、连环画，因为事迹本身就充满了说服力，有很高的艺术价值。同学们并在两次演讲会后，请英模们参加小组座谈，更亲切、更完整的英模面貌，映入到同学们的心目中。
    燕京大学全校师生员工和附中同学一千多人，于五日邀请了劳模李凤莲、于振善到校报告。报告后，同学们包围着两位劳模，与他们握手，要求他们签名，并争看于振善创制的圆形计算尺。同学们热情地说：“我们要学习劳模们对祖国、对人民的无限忠诚，和忘我的工作精神。”
    五日，青年团京市三区工委邀请了战斗英雄吕俊生、柴学久和姜荣光，向师大附中三部的团员、少年儿童队员和同学作报告。师大附中四部和其他学校的同学，亦于五日下午在市六中听到战斗英雄陆相时和刘奎基的讲演。同学们以一束束的鲜花献给英雄们，表示了自己的敬意。师大附中四部同学洪斌和曹占马都说：“我们要老老实实的学习英雄们为人民工作的精神。”
