Foreign guests invited to participate in the conference included Czech Ambassador Weiskopf, Korean Ambassador Li Zhouyuan, Romanian Ambassador Rudenko, Polish Ambassador Burgin, Mongolian Ambassador Jalkhasaikhan, Bulgarian Ambassador Petkov, Head of the Diplomatic Mission of the German Democratic Republic Koenig, and Counselor of the Hungarian Embassy Fekete, totaling more than 70 people.

The commemorative meeting began in the solemn sounds of the national anthems of China and the Soviet Union. At the meeting, Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the General Association of Sino-Soviet Friendship, first reported on the general situation of the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association across the country over the past year. Subsequently, Vice Presidents of the General Association Soong Ching Ling, Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Soviet Ambassador Roshchin, combat hero Wei Laiguo, who attended the National Conference of Combat Heroes Representatives, and labor model Tian Guiying, who attended the National Conference of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, delivered speeches.

In her speech, Vice President Soong Ching Ling pointed out: "Sino-Soviet friendship" protects the present and determines the future. The Sino-Soviet friendship expressed in countless facts is brotherly mutual assistance and a profound respect for national autonomy. Most importantly, it represents the great unity guiding mankind towards a common goal. Vice President Soong said: The people's China and the Soviet Union are two large countries with vast territories and large populations. As they move forward hand in hand, where they combine their strength, they can crush the chains of the reactionaries, and make the reactionaries, who fantasize about launching wars to destroy humanity for a few stinky dollars, tremble with fear. As they move forward hand in hand, holding high the banner of peace, they are creating, inspiring, and building the world of the future.

Vice President Li Jishen, in reviewing the profound friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples over the past thirty years, said: Looking back at the revolutionary experiences and historical lessons of recent years, we can clearly see that only the Soviet Union is our most loyal and reliable good friend. They have always helped us wholeheartedly. Vice President Li pointed out: We should firmly stand on the side of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, follow Chairman Mao's "leaning to one side" foreign policy, consolidate Sino-Soviet friendly relations under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, strengthen the international democratic united front, promote the great unity of the people of the world, and strive for people's democracy and lasting world peace.

Vice President Guo Moruo said at the meeting: Thanks to Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin, the people of our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, have a solemn and splendid Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, which solidifies the brotherly friendship between the peoples of the two countries. Vice President Guo said: Today, due to the victory of our people's revolution, the domestic enemies have been basically overthrown, but the foreign enemies, the US imperialists who lead the aggressive bloc, are baring their fangs and claws and carrying out armed aggression. They are invading our neighbor Korea, invading our territory of Taiwan, and even repeatedly bombing our Northeast and interfering with our maritime transportation. The US imperialists are the deadly enemies of the Chinese people, the deadly enemies of the Asian people, the deadly enemies of the people of the whole world, and the deadly enemies of Chinese peace, Asian peace, and world peace. Peace is precious, and peace is indivisible. Today, if we want to defend peace, we must strengthen the combination of our patriotism and internationalism, and we must further strengthen the strength of our peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, mobilize peace-loving working people around the world to fight to completely smash the aggression of US imperialism and to defend lasting world peace!

Soviet Ambassador Roshchin, in his speech, conveyed the warm congratulations of the Soviet people on the first anniversary of the founding of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution. Ambassador Roshchin said: The Soviet people, educated in the spirit of loyalty to the principles of proletarian internationalism, have always fully understood and deeply sympathized with the heroic struggle of the Chinese people and their glorious Communist Party for the interests of the working people, for national independence, and for their happy future. The victory of the Chinese people has opened the way for the consolidation and development of Sino-Soviet friendship. The Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed on February 14, 1950, reflects the friendship of the people of the two great nations. This treaty meets the basic interests of the Soviet and Chinese peoples and ensures that the Soviet Union and China have all the necessary conditions to prevent Japan and other countries colluding with Japan from re-aggression and disrupting peace. In expressing his congratulations and gratitude to the attendees, Ambassador Roshchin said: I wish you new achievements in the work of the Association, in the cause of opposing the instigators of a new war by the United States and Britain, and in the struggle for peace. Please allow me to assure you that we, the Soviet people, will do all we can and give you our warmest support in fulfilling our common task of developing and consolidating the friendship of our two great peoples.

Combat hero Wei Laiguo said at the meeting: We must study the advanced Soviet military science and excellent combat experience well, and build the People's Liberation Army into a modern, powerful, and invincible national defense force to defend the people's motherland and defend world peace.

Tian Guiying, the first female driver in China trained by Soviet experts and a labor model, used her personal experience to call on the Chinese people, Chinese workers, and Chinese women to do a good job in Sino-Soviet friendship and learn from the Soviet Union.

After Ambassador Roshchin, on behalf of the Soviet Foreign Cultural Association, announced the list of gifts presented to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Yan Baohang, Deputy Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, read out the congratulatory telegrams from Ginisov, Chairman of the Soviet Foreign Cultural Association, and Dr. Bogdan Joseph, Vice Chairman of the Romanian Rosu Friendship Association.

The commemorative meeting was conducted in a warm and friendly atmosphere. After the meeting, the Central Academy of Drama staged the new play "Peace Dove."

    纪念大会在庄严的中苏两国国歌声中开始。会上，首由中苏友好协会总会总干事钱俊瑞报告了一年来全国中苏友协工作概况。继由该会总会副会长宋庆龄、李济深、郭沫若，苏联大使罗申，出席全国战斗英雄代表会议的战斗英雄魏来国与出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的劳动模范田桂英等讲话。
    宋庆龄副会长讲话中指出：“中苏友好”这四个字保卫着现在，并且决定着将来。从无数的事实里表达出来的中苏友谊，是兄弟般的互助，是深刻地尊重民族自主的行为，尤其主要的，这是代表着引导人类向一个同一目标前进的大团结。宋副会长说：人民的中国和苏联是两个地大人众的大国家。他们手牵着手一同前进，他们在那里结合起他们的力量来，就能在那里粉碎反动派的锁链，就能使为了几个臭钱而狂想发动战争消灭人类的反动派害怕到发抖。他们手牵着手一同前进，高举着和平的旗帜，为了创造着、鼓舞着、缔造着未来的世界。
    李济深副会长在回顾三十年来中苏人民深厚的友谊时说：我们就近年来革命的经验和历史教训对证起来看，可以得到清楚的证明，只有苏联才是我们最忠实可靠的好朋友。他们始终全心全意的帮助我们。李副会长指出：我们应该坚定立场，要站在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营方面，遵循毛主席的“一面倒”的外交政策，在中国共产党领导之下，巩固中苏友好关系，加强国际民主统一战线，促成世界人民大团结，争取人民民主与世界持久和平。
    郭沫若副会长在会上说：感谢毛主席，感谢斯大林大元帅，我们中苏两国人民已经有了庄严灿烂的中苏友好同盟互助条约，把中苏两国人民兄弟般的友谊固定了。郭副会长说：在今天，由于我们人民革命的胜利，国内的敌人在基本上虽被打倒了，但国外的敌人，领导侵略集团的美帝国主义，正张牙舞爪，实行武装侵略。他们正侵略我们的邻邦朝鲜，侵略我们的领土台湾，更进而屡次空袭我们的东北、干犯我们的海上交通。美帝国主义者，是中国人民的死对头，是亚洲人民的死对头，是全世界人民的死对头，是中国和平、亚洲和平、世界和平的死对头。和平是可珍贵的，和平是不可分割的。今天我们要保卫和平，就必须加强我们的爱国主义与国际主义的结合，必须更进一步地加强我们以苏联为首的和平阵营的力量，在全世界范围内，动员爱好和平的劳动人民，为彻底粉碎美帝国主义的侵略而奋斗，为保卫世界持久和平而奋斗！
    苏联大使罗申在讲话中转达了苏联人民对中苏友好协会成立一周年及中国人民革命伟大胜利的热诚祝贺。罗申大使说：以忠心于无产阶级国际主义原则的精神所教养的苏联人民，对于中国人民和他光荣的共产党，为劳动人民的利益，争取民族的独立和争取自己幸福的未来，进行的英勇斗争，一向是完全了解并深表同情的。中国人民的胜利，打开了中苏友好的巩固和发展的道路。在一九五○年二月十四日所签订的中苏友好同盟互助条约上表现了两大国家的人民友谊。这个条约，符合苏联人民和中国人民的基本利益，保证苏联和中国有一切必需的条件，以阻止日本和其他勾结日本的国家重新侵略和破坏和平。罗申大使在向到会者表示祝贺和谢意时说：祝你们在协会的工作里，在反对美英新战争的挑拨者和在争取和平而斗争的事业里有新的成就。请容许我向你们保证，我们苏联人民，将尽我们所有的力量，并且在完成我们两国伟大人民友谊的发展和巩固的共同任务中，对你们尽最热烈的支持。
    战斗英雄魏来国在会上说：我们要好好学习先进的苏联军事科学与优异的作战经验，把人民解放军建设成为现代化的、强大无敌的国防军，保卫人民祖国，保卫世界和平。
    由苏联专家培养出来的中国第一个女司机、劳动模范田桂英以其亲身经历，号召中国人民、中国工人、中国妇女做好中苏友好工作，向苏联学习。
    大会在罗申大使代表苏联对外文化协会宣读赠送中苏友好协会的礼品单后，由中苏友协总会副总干事阎宝航宣读苏联对外文化协会主席吉尼索夫以及罗马尼亚罗苏友好协会副主席保格丹·约瑟夫博士的贺电。
