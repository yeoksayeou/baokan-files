　　How Does the "Study" Editorial Department Work?
    The work of the "Study" magazine editorial department is mainly divided into three parts (excluding administrative aspects), namely: communications and liaison, guidance, and editing.
    The communications and liaison section is responsible for contacting readers. "Study" magazine's direct contact with readers mainly involves these three aspects: First, many readers submit articles to "Study" magazine. The editorial department receives an average of about one hundred letters from readers every day. We must carefully review these submissions and provide feedback. Reviewing reader submissions is not only to select the articles we need, but more importantly, to give readers our feedback and guide them to write the articles we need. In addition, we need to research and synthesize reader submissions to understand the general thinking of readers and the situation of the study movement. Second, many readers ask "Study" magazine about the problems they encounter in their studies. We receive a total of fifty or sixty questions every day, sometimes more than one hundred. Handling these questions is a very heavy task. We roughly divide these questions into three parts: some are answered directly and individually, some are answered in the publication, and some are answered after comprehensive research. Our question-answering work provides specific help to readers' learning on the one hand, and more importantly, it also helps us understand the common problems and general thinking of readers in each period from the questions raised by readers. Third, each issue of "Study" magazine includes a slip for soliciting readers' opinions, asking readers to give their opinions on the issue or on a particular article after reading it. We now receive hundreds of readers' opinions every day. We classify, sort out, and study these opinions, and make several copies to be sent to the relevant authors. In addition, there is the indirect contact with readers, which is the work of correspondents. "Study" magazine has more than 300 correspondents nationwide, most of whom are responsible for leading the study of leading cadres in their respective organizations. Their work is to fill out a communication form every month, reporting the learning situation of their respective organizations, collecting relevant learning materials, and reflecting readers' opinions and questions.
    The guidance section is responsible for contacting the study committees of various organizations and other organizations that lead learning. This work currently has two main aspects: On the one hand, it is to investigate and study the learning situation of cadres in various organizations. The methods are: first, to ask various organizations for various materials related to cadre learning; second, to hold various discussion meetings; third, to regularly send reporters to visit various organizations to understand the cadre learning situation. On the other hand, it is to guide the cadre learning of various organizations. The methods are: first, to hold regular learning report meetings, with appropriate cadres selected by various organizations to listen and be responsible for conveying the information in their own organizations; second, to hold seminars for learning instructors from various organizations to answer questions orally; third, to focus on sending people to help some organizations with cadre learning; fourth, to compile and print correspondence course materials.
    Communications and liaison work and guidance work are the basic links in our editorial department's work. This work includes two aspects: on the one hand, giving things to the masses; on the other hand, asking for things from the masses. Through this work, the editorial department has consolidated its ties with the vast number of readers and various learning leadership organizations. The things we ask for from the masses are mainly information about learning and the general thinking of the masses, which is very important to the "Study" magazine editorial department, because our editing work is based on this foundation.
    Now let's talk about our editing work. After doing a good job in communications and liaison work and guidance work, we can generally grasp the general situation. At this time, the main task of the editing work is to formulate an editorial plan based on these situations and in conjunction with the overall policy. This plan includes the main content and main column topics for a certain period of time. Then organize the manuscripts according to this plan.
    The "Study" magazine editorial department has relatively close ties with authors. The main thing is to regularly invite authors to hold meetings on the content and editorial work of the magazine. The editorial department also regularly sorts out readers' opinions and questions, as well as relevant materials, and sends them to authors for reference. This not only provides authors with some convenience when writing articles, but also enables them to write articles that are more closely related to reality because they have a better understanding of the editorial department's intentions and the readers' situation.

　　《学习》编辑部是怎样工作的？
    《学习》杂志编辑部的工作主要分为三个部分（行政部分不计在内），即：通讯联络部分、辅导部分及编辑部分。
    通联部分负责与读者联系的工作。《学习》杂志与读者的直接联系，主要有这三方面：一、很多读者向《学习》杂志投稿。编辑部收到的读者来信每天平均约一百封。对这些来稿，我们必须认真审读，提出意见。审读读者来稿，不仅是为了要在这些稿件中选出我们所需要的稿件，更主要的是在于向读者提出我们读后的意见，领导读者来写我们所需要的稿件。此外就是要把读者来稿加以研究综合，从这里面来了解一般读者的思想情形和有关学习运动的情况。二、很多读者向《学习》杂志提出他们在学习中遇到的问题。我们每天收到的问题总有五六十则，有时多至百余则，处理这些问题，是一个很繁重的工作。我们大体上把这些问题分成三部分，一部分直接个别答复，一部分在刊物上答复，还有一部分则是综合研究后答复。我们的问题解答工作，一方面是给读者的学习以具体的帮助，一方面更重要的也是为了从读者提出的问题中了解每一个时期读者中普遍存在的问题和一般的思想情况。三、《学习》杂志每期都附有征求读者意见的条子，要求读者读过每一期后，提出他对于这一期的意见或对某一篇文章的意见。现在我们每天收到几百份读者的意见，这些意见我们分类加以整理研究，并复印若干份分送有关作者。此外，还有与读者间接联系的工作，这就是通讯员的工作。《学习》杂志在全国范围内共有通讯员三百余人，这三百多通讯员，大部分都担负着所属机关的领导干部学习的责任。他们的工作，是每月填写一份通讯表，报告他们所属机关的学习情况，搜集有关学习的材料和反映读者的意见和问题。
    辅导部分负责与各机关学委会和其它领导学习的机关的联系。这工作目前主要有两面：一方面是调查研究机关干部学习的情况，其办法是：一、向各机关要各种有关干部学习的材料，二、召集各种座谈会，三、经常派出记者访问各机关，了解干部学习情况。另一方面是辅导各机关的干部学习，其办法是：一、举办定期的学习报告会，由各机关选派适当干部听讲并负责在本机关传达，二、举办各机关学习指导人的座谈会，口头解答问题，三、有重点的派人帮助一些机关的干部学习，四、编印函授讲义。
    通联工作和辅导工作，是我们编辑部工作的基本环节。这工作包括两方面的内容，一方面是给群众以东西，另一方面是向群众要东西。通过这工作，巩固了编辑部与广大读者和各学习领导机关的联系。我们向群众要来的东西，主要是一些有关学习和一般群众思想的情况，这对于《学习》杂志编辑部来说非常重要，因为我们的编辑工作是在这个基础上面进行的。
    现在再来谈一下我们的编辑工作。在做好了通联工作与辅导工作之后，大体上我们已能掌握一般的情况，这时的编辑工作主要的是根据这些情况，结合总的方针，来制订编辑计划。这个计划包括一定时期的主要内容和主要各栏的题目。然后根据这计划组织稿件。
    《学习》杂志编辑部与作者之间有善比较密切的联系。主要的是经常邀请作者举行有关杂志内容和编辑工作的会议。编辑部并经常整理读者的意见和问题，以及有关的材料送给作者参考。这样不仅使作者在写文章时得到一些便利，而且由于比较了解编辑部的意图和读者的情况之故，写出来的文章也比较的能结合实际。
