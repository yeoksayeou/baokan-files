　　Continue the Struggle Against Counter-Revolutionaries
    Li Nanshan
    For the past year, the People's Liberation Army, the People's Public Security Organs, and the Public Security Forces, following the policies instructed by Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, have waged a resolute struggle against bandits, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries, and have achieved great victories. In the work of suppressing bandit armed forces, nearly one million bandits have been eliminated in the newly liberated areas of Northwest, Southwest, Central South, and East China over the past year. In the Southwest region, which was liberated last and suffered the most serious banditry, the main bandit forces have been largely annihilated, with more than 400,000 bandits eliminated in the first half of the year. Large bandit groups in the Central South provinces have been basically wiped out. Western Hunan and Southern Hunan, where banditry has been incessant for decades, have now been basically cleared up, and the major bandit forces within Guangdong and Guangxi have been largely annihilated. In the East China region, with the exception of Fujian, where there are still organized bandit activities, and some areas of Zhejiang, where there are still a few bandit groups roaming, the major bandit forces in the entire region have been basically wiped out. In the Northwest, the bandit forces in Gansu have been basically wiped out, and the bandit forces in Ningxia and Qinghai have also been largely annihilated; the remnant bandits in Southern Shaanxi have fled to the bordering mountainous areas; in Xinjiang, the die-hard bandits Usman, Yao Lebos, and Janim Khan, the running dogs of American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit gang, have been basically wiped out by the People's Liberation Army in conjunction with the people of all ethnic groups after a resolute campaign of suppression, and Janim Khan, one of the bandit leaders, has been captured alive by our army.
    Great achievements have also been made in eliminating spies. Over the past year, more than 13,700 special agents have been arrested nationwide, and 175 radio stations have been seized. In addition, seven international espionage cases have been uncovered. In Beijing alone, since liberation, more than 170 major sabotage cases involving special agents have been uncovered, nearly 1,000 special agents have been arrested, more than 2,000 special agents have been centrally managed and trained, and more than 3,000 people have registered for self-renewal.
    Due to the above-mentioned major victories achieved by the Chinese people on the anti-bandit and anti-espionage front, the social order in the cities and rural areas of the vast newly liberated areas has become increasingly stable, and the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas has been increasing day by day. This situation has played a huge role in stabilizing prices, restoring and developing production, and stabilizing the people's lives in various places. It has also created the necessary conditions for the large-scale land reform work to be carried out after this autumn.
    Although we have achieved the above victories, this situation should not in the slightest degree cause us to become ideologically paralyzed. According to the existing materials, although the bandit situation in various places has begun to decline, and special agent spies have suffered a great blow, they are not reconciled to their failure and are still continuing to struggle. Especially after the United States armed aggression against Korea, due to the active instigation of the remnant bandits in Taiwan and American imperialism, bandits and special agents are taking the opportunity to engage in activities again. They rob public grain, burn warehouses, sabotage requisitioning, and kill government grain requisitioning personnel, committing all kinds of evils. The activities of special agents in various places have also become more concealed, and they have adopted new methods of struggle such as long-term lurking, waiting for opportunities, and focusing on sabotage and assassination activities. According to the special agent cases uncovered this year, the enemy's sabotage focuses on our economic construction undertakings. They use various methods to sabotage our factories, mines, and transportation, causing great damage to national wealth. Therefore, cadres at all levels and all the people must not relax their vigilance in the slightest degree. A slight negligence or carelessness towards the activities of counter-revolutionaries will cause the people to suffer great losses and the country to suffer many unexpected losses.
    People will ask: Why can't the bandit armed forces and special agent counter-revolutionaries be quickly eliminated, or why are they rediscovered after being eliminated?
    To explain this problem, we should first understand the nature and background of bandits and special agents. The vast majority of bandits and special agents who are causing trouble and chaos in various places today were pre-arranged by the Kuomintang bandit gang before its collapse. For example, before the liberation of the Southwest, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang held five sessions of so-called "guerrilla cadre training classes" in Chengdu, with more than 3,000 people participating in the training. These specially trained saboteurs were planned and placed in various places to actively carry out activities before liberation.
    Secondly, bandits and special agents in various places have close collusion with local bullies, landlords, reactionary secret societies, and other feudal forces. Some bandit teams themselves were originally armed forces of reactionary landlords. Therefore, before the national land reform work is fully completed and the feudal forces are finally eliminated, it is difficult to completely eliminate the bandit armed forces.
    Thirdly, and most importantly, the bandits and special agent counter-revolutionaries have the support and instigation of imperialism, especially American imperialism. After the Chinese mainland has been basically liberated and the Kuomintang bandit army on the mainland has been completely annihilated, using bandits and special agents to carry out sabotage activities has become an important means for American imperialism to carry out aggression against China. The collusion between the Kuomintang remnant bandits and American imperialism in carrying out special agent activities against the new China has a long history. As early as November last year, the remnant bandit special agent leader Zheng Jiemin flew to the United States to negotiate with former US ambassador to China Stuart, Wedemeyer, and Meles (one of the US special agent leaders) on the issue of rebuilding the "Sino-US Intelligence Cooperation Agency." After Zheng returned to China, he began to establish Sino-US intelligence cooperation agencies in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other places, and established the "Sino-US Intelligence Cooperation Institute," a special agent headquarters in Hong Kong. In order to step up espionage activities against our country, American imperialism has opened spy schools in Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines, and other places, and trained a large number of special agents. The schools are managed by American experts, and most of the students are recruited from former officials of the Kuomintang bandit gang and former special agent organizations of the Japanese army. The courses include training in the use of weapons and explosives. After graduating, these special agents infiltrate the Chinese mainland to carry out activities. According to a survey in one area of ​​Southwest China, 60% of the main bandit leaders in the Southwest provinces have received Chiang-US special agent training. Since American imperialism launched its war of aggression against Korea, the American spy agency organization centered in Tokyo is stepping up its activities. At the end of July, MacArthur sent Japanese special agent Yazaki Resch secretly to Hong Kong to collect former Japanese special agents in Hong Kong and plan sabotage activities against our mainland.
    Based on the above analysis, it can be seen that special agents and bandits are the most loyal running dogs and tools of feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and imperialism remaining in China. Today, feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism have been overthrown in China, but they are still attempting to struggle with the support of imperialism by using the most despicable and shameless special agent and bandit activities. Therefore, eliminating and suppressing counter-revolutionaries cannot but be a fierce, sharp, and also complex and long-term struggle.
    Fighting counter-revolutionaries is an important task for us at present. To make this struggle victorious and successful, we must master the correct policy, which is the policy proposed by Chairman Mao of "punishing the ringleaders, not questioning the coerced, and rewarding the meritorious." These three policies are indispensable. The instructions on suppressing counter-revolutionary activities issued by the State Council of the Central People's Government and the Supreme People's Court on July 23 this year are a concretization of this policy, and our cadres at all levels should earnestly study and master these instructions.
    However, according to reports from various places, our cadres in various places still often make "left" and right deviations in the struggle against counter-revolutionaries, and the main one is the right deviation. For example, some areas easily release important bandit leaders after only a short period of imprisonment; some bandits continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities after being captured and released five times. Taking such an overly lenient attitude towards counter-revolutionaries will actually become a connivance to counter-revolutionaries, which will cause great dissatisfaction among the masses, so that the masses dare not report bandits and special agents to the government for fear of retaliation by bandits and special agents. Some people said: "I am not afraid of heaven, I am not afraid of earth, I am only afraid of the Communist Party talking about leniency." This is criticizing some of our cadres for neglecting the "punishing the ringleaders" clause. Counter-revolutionaries who have committed heinous crimes must be severely suppressed and sentenced to death or long-term imprisonment according to law; otherwise, the purpose of educating and uniting the masses and isolating counter-revolutionaries cannot be achieved. Of course, on the other hand, we should also prevent excessive methods such as indiscriminate arrests, beatings, and killings. If special agents deceive a part of the masses and cause riots, then we must pay special attention to political disintegration work, strive for the majority of those who have been deceived and threatened to repent and rehabilitate themselves, and withdraw from special agent and bandit organizations in order to isolate resolute counter-revolutionaries, and give these resolute counter-revolutionaries a resolute blow. Only in this way can we avoid making mistakes and quickly eliminate all bandits, special agents, bullies, and other counter-revolutionaries who endanger the people.
    Severely suppressing counter-revolutionary activities is an indispensable step for us to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and restore and develop production. It is one of the eight tasks that must be done well at present listed by Chairman Mao in his report at the Third Plenary Session of the CPC. We must unite the people of the whole country, master the correct policies, and wipe out all bandits, special agent counter-revolutionaries, and strive to complete the tasks put forward by Chairman Mao and further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.

### 继续与反革命分子作斗争

　　继续与反革命分子作斗争
    李南山
    一年以来，人民解放军、人民公安机关和公安部队遵循着毛主席和中央人民政府所指示的政策，和土匪、特务等反革命分子进行了坚决的斗争，并取得很大的胜利。在清剿土匪武装的工作上，一年来，在西北、西南、中南、华东等新解放区剿灭土匪近百万人。解放最晚、匪患最严重的西南地区主要股匪已大部歼灭，上半年来歼匪四十余万名。中南各省大股土匪已基本肃清。湘西、湘南数十年来匪患不绝，现已基本澄清，广东、广西境内股匪已大部歼灭。华东地区除福建尚有成股的土匪活动，浙江部分地区尚有少数股匪流窜外，全境股匪已基本肃清。西北的甘肃股匪已基本肃清，宁夏、青海的股匪亦大部被歼；陕南残匪则已窜据边沿山地；在新疆叛乱的美帝国主义和国民党匪帮的走狗乌斯满、尧乐博斯、贾尼木汗等顽匪，经人民解放军联合各族人民予以坚决进剿后，到七月底亦已基本肃清，匪首之一的贾尼木汗并被我军生擒。
    在肃清间谍的工作上也获得巨大的成绩。一年来全国逮捕了特务分子一万三千七百余名，缴获电台一百七十五部。此外，还破获国际间谍案七起。仅北京一地，解放以来就破获了较大的特务破坏案件一百七十多起，逮捕特务分子近千名，集中管训特务分子二千多名，另有登记自新分子三千多名。
    由于中国人民在剿匪肃特的战线上取得了上述重大的胜利，广大新解放区的城市和农村社会秩序已日趋安定，城乡物资交流已日益增加。这种情况对各地稳定物价，恢复和发展生产，安定人民生活起了巨大的作用。也为今年秋后开展的大规模的土地改革工作创造了必需的条件。
    虽然我们取得了上述胜利，但这种情况决不能丝毫引起我们思想上的麻痹。根据已有的材料看来，虽然各地匪势已经开始下降，特务间谍分子已遭到很大打击，但他们并不甘心于他们的失败，他们仍在继续挣扎。特别是在美国武装侵略朝鲜以后，由于台湾残匪和美帝国主义的积极策动，土匪特务又在乘机活动。他们抢夺公粮，焚烧仓库，破坏征收，杀害政府的征粮人员，无恶不作。各地特务分子的活动也更加隐蔽，他们采取了长期潜伏，等待时机，重点破坏与暗害活动的新的斗争方式。根据今年破获的特务案件看来，敌人的破坏重点是我们的经济建设事业。他们用各种方式破坏我们的工厂、矿山和交通运输，对国家财富造成了很大的损害。因此，我们各级干部和全体人民丝毫不能放松警惕，对反革命分子的活动稍有疏忽和大意，就会使人民吃大亏，就会使国家遭到许多意外的损失。
    人们会问：为什么土匪武装和特务反革命分子不能很快肃清或者是肃清以后又会重新发现呢？
    要说明这个问题，应该首先弄清楚土匪特务的性质和背景。今天在各地为患作乱的土匪特务，绝大多数都是国民党匪帮在溃灭前预先布置下来的。例如蒋匪在西南解放前曾在成都先后举办了五期所谓“游击干部训练班”，参加受训的有三千多人。这种特意训练出来的破坏分子，在解放前已有计划地安置在各处积极活动。
    其次，各地土匪特务和恶霸地主、反动会门等封建势力有密切的勾结，有的土匪队伍本身原来就是反动地主的武装。因此，在全国土地改革工作未全部完成，封建势力未被最后消灭之前，要完全肃清土匪武装是有困难的。
    第三，也是最重要的，就是土匪、特务反革命分子背后有帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义的支持和策动。在中国大陆已经基本上解放，国民党在大陆上的匪军已全部被歼灭之后，利用土匪特务进行破坏活动，成为美帝国主义对中国进行侵略的重要手段。国民党残匪和美帝国主义相互勾结对新中国进行特务活动由来已久，早在去年十一月间，残匪特务头子郑介民就曾飞往美国和美前驻华大使司徒雷登、魏德迈、梅乐斯（美特务头子之一）谈判重建“中美情报合作机构”问题。郑匪回国后即着手在台湾、香港等地建立美蒋情报合作机构，在香港成立特务总部“中美情报合作所”。为了加紧对我国进行间谍活动，美帝国主义在台湾、日本、菲律宾等地都开办了间谍学校，大批训练特工人员，学校由美国专家管理，学生大半是由国民党匪帮以前的官吏中和前日本军队的特务组织中招募的，课程包括武器和炸药使用的训练。这些特务分子毕业后就潜入中国大陆活动。据西南一个地区的调查，西南各省主要匪首有百分之六十是受过蒋美特务训练的。自美帝国主义在朝鲜发动侵略战争以后，以东京为中心的美国间谍特务组织正加紧进行活动。七月底，麦克阿瑟曾派遣日本特务矢崎勒什秘密到香港活动，目的在搜罗在香港的原日本特务分子，策划对我大陆的破坏活动。
    根据上面的分析，可见特务、土匪就是封建主义、官僚资本主义和帝国主义残留在中国的最忠实的走狗和工具。今天，封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国已被打倒，但还在帝国主义的支持下企图用最卑鄙无耻的特务土匪活动来进行挣扎。因此，肃清和镇压反革命分子就不能不是一场激烈的、尖锐的，同时也是复杂的、长期的斗争。
    和反革命分子作斗争是我们目前一个重要的任务。要使这个斗争进行得胜利和成功，必须掌握正确的政策，这个政策就是毛主席所提出的“首恶者必办、胁从者不问、立功者受奖”的政策。这三条政策不可缺一。本年七月二十三日中央人民政府政务院和最高人民法院所发布的关于镇压反革命活动的指示，就是这个政策的具体化，我们各级干部都应该认真地研究和掌握这个指示。
    但是，根据各地反映，我们各地干部在和反革命分子作斗争时，还时常发生“左”右的偏差，而主要的是右的偏差。例如有些地区捕获重要匪首只经过短期监禁即轻易释放；有的土匪经五擒五放后仍继续进行反革命活动。对反革命分子采取这种过分宽大的态度，实际上会成为对反革命分子的纵容，而引起群众很大的不满，以致群众发现土匪特务也不敢向政府报告，怕遭到匪特的报复。有的群众说：“天不怕，地不怕，就怕共产党讲宽大。”这就是批评我们某些干部偏废了“首恶者必办”这一条。对于罪大恶极的反革命分子必须加以严厉的镇压，依法处以死刑或长期徒刑，不如此，就不能达到教育与团结群众，孤立反革命分子的目的。当然，在另方面，我们也应防止乱抓、乱打、乱杀等过激的办法。如果特务分子诱骗了一部分群众因而形成骚乱事件，那就必须特别注意政治瓦解工作，争取大多数被欺骗和威胁的人悔过自新，退出特务土匪组织，以孤立坚决的反革命分子。并予这些坚决的反革命分子以坚决的打击。只有这样，我们才不会犯错误，才能迅速地肃清一切危害人民的土匪、特务、恶霸及其他反革命分子。
    严厉镇压反革命活动，是我们巩固人民民主专政，恢复和发展生产不可缺少的步骤，是毛主席在中共三中全会的报告中列为当前必须作好的八项工作之一。我们必须团结全国人民，掌握正确的政策，扑灭一切土匪、特务反革命分子，为完成毛主席所提出的任务，进一步巩固人民民主专政而奋斗。
