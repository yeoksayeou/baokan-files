TASS reporter in Seoul, in his dispatch “The Heroic Defense of Seoul,” quoted an American prisoner of war as saying that the road from Inchon to Seoul was “the road to the grave.” This statement was confirmed by an Agence France-Presse dispatch on September 26: "U.S. Marines have suffered half their casualties in fierce street fighting and hand-to-hand combat with fiercely resisting North Koreans." This statement was also confirmed by a United Press dispatch on September 27: "Bloody house-to-house battles have made them (referring to the American invading forces - translator) pay a heavy price for every inch of land." "A Marine Corps staff officer told a United Press reporter: 'We are running into difficult times….'"

"Difficult times" actually didn't start "running into" then. The "staff officer" should remember: as soon as the American invading forces arrived in Korea, they suffered from "shock sickness." Ground Forces Commander Walker panicked and had to "call on the Eighth Army to hold its ground and not think about individual or mass surrender." (Associated Press dispatch, July 29) But those suffering from "shock sickness" still had to think about and carry out individual or mass surrender. MacArthur panicked again, so when invading Seoul with twenty times the strength of the defending forces, he used another shameless drug – a "message to the soldiers" that "encouraged base instincts" (in the words of a Pravda reporter): "You are facing a wealthy city, full of fine wines and delicacies. After taking Seoul, all the girls will be yours. The property of the residents belongs to the victors, and you can send parcels home." (Pravda Korean dispatch, September 23)

However, in the process of "taking" Seoul, "casualties have reached half." What they tasted first was not "fine wines and delicacies," but "difficult times"; what they first sent home was not "the property of the residents," but the ashes of the invaders! So "after taking Seoul," what else do the remaining invading forces have besides aggravating their "shock sickness"?

American invaders on the "road to the grave," if the lessons the Korean people have given you in the past three months are not deep enough, even greater lessons await you.

### “拿下汉城之后”

　　“拿下汉城之后”
    林淡秋
    塔斯社驻汉城记者在“英雄的汉城保卫战”那篇通讯中曾经引用美帝俘虏的话，说从仁川到汉城是“走向坟墓之路”。这句话被九月二十六日法国新闻社消息证明了：“美海军陆战队在与猛烈抵抗的北朝鲜人巷战肉搏中伤亡已达半数。”这句话也被九月二十七日美国合众社消息证明了：“浴血的逐屋战使他们（指美国侵略军——作者）每得一英寸土地都付出昂贵的代价。”“海军陆战队参谋官员告合众社记者称：‘我们碰到了困苦的时候……。’”
    “困苦的时候”，其实不是那时才开始“碰到”的。“参谋官员”应该记得：美国侵略军一到朝鲜，便患了“吃惊病”，地面部队司令官瓦克慌了，不得不“号召第八军坚守阵地，不要想到个别投降或集体投降。”（美联社七月二十九日电）可是“吃惊病”患者仍然要想到而且做到个别投降或集体投降。麦克阿瑟又慌了，于是在以二十倍于守军的兵力进犯汉城的时候，用了另外一服无耻的药——一篇“鼓励卑鄙的本能”（真理报记者语）的“告士兵书”：“你们正面对着一个富裕的城市，有的是美酒佳肴。拿下汉城之后，所有女郎都是你们的了。居民的财产是属于胜利者的，你们可以寄包裹回家去。”（九月二十三真理报朝鲜通讯）
    然而在“拿下”汉城的过程中，“伤亡已达半数了”。他们首先尝到的不是“美酒佳肴”，而是“困苦”；他们首先寄回家去的不是“居民的财产”，而是侵略者的骨灰！那么“拿下汉城之后”，残余侵略军除了加重其“吃惊病”之外，还有什么呢？
    “走向坟墓之路”的美国侵略者啊，三个月来朝鲜人民给你们的教训，如果还不够深的话，更大的教训在等待你们的。
