Xinhua News Agency, Moscow dispatch: The thirty-ninth issue of the magazine "New Era," published on September 27, carried a special article by Avalin entitled "The International Significance of the Chinese People's Victory," discussing the brilliant achievements made by the People's Republic of China in the year since its founding. It stated that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the working class and its vanguard—the Communist Party—are achieving great success and undergoing transformation. The People's Republic of China, rising from the ruins of the former semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, undeniably proves the disintegration of the imperialist colonial system and the fact that the imperialist colonial rear is falling apart. The People's Republic of China is convincing evidence that the imperialist reserve army has become an active and powerful enemy of the imperialist system, a fighter for peace, progress, and democracy.

The author emphasized that the victory of the Chinese people's democratic system is one of the many failures suffered by reactionary forces in the era of the general crisis of capitalism, and it has significant international importance.

　　《新时代》专文论述
    中国人民的胜利有重大国际意义
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：九月二十七日出版的三十九期《新时代》杂志，刊登了阿瓦林所撰题为《中国人民胜利的国际意义》的专文，论述中华人民共和国成立一年来所获得的辉煌成就称：中国人民在工人阶级及其先锋队——共产党的领导下，正获得巨大的成绩并进行着转变。在以往半封建半殖民地的废墟上兴起的中华人民共和国，不可否认地证明了帝国主义的殖民制度的解体，并证明了帝国主义殖民地后方正在分崩离析的事实。中华人民共和国是一个令人信服的证据，说明了帝国主义的后备军，变成了帝国主义制度的积极而强大的敌人，变成了和平，进步和民主的斗士。
    作者强调指出：中国人民民主制度的胜利，乃是反动力量在资本主义总危机时代中所遭受的许多失败中的一个失败，它具有重大的国际意义。
