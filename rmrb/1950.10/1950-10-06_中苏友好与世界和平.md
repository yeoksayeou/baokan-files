　　Sino-Soviet Friendship and World Peace
    Chen Jiakang
    The most important event in world politics in 1949 was the founding of the People's Republic of China. The establishment of the People's Republic of China brought about a fundamental change in the balance of power between the anti-imperialist democratic camp and the imperialist anti-democratic camp. At the same time, the establishment of the People's Republic of China enabled the Chinese people to unite completely with the Soviet people. The people of China and the Soviet Union are united, back to back, facing Europe on the one hand, supporting the peace-loving people of Europe; and facing Asia on the other, supporting the peace-loving people of Asia. Peace-loving people all over the world are excited about this. In this way, an unprecedentedly favorable situation has been created in the struggle against imperialism.
    However, this unprecedentedly favorable situation has not been fully recognized by some people because it has developed too quickly. That is to say, there is still an opinion that underestimates the growing strength of the anti-imperialist democratic camp. At the same time, the strength of the imperialist anti-democratic camp, which has been severely weakened by the First World War and the Second World War, is overestimated. Here, a question must be answered: In the current world politics, is the strength of the imperialist anti-democratic camp the decisive factor? Or is the strength of the anti-imperialist democratic camp the decisive factor? Undoubtedly, the growing strength of the anti-imperialist democratic camp has become the most important decisive factor in current world politics. We must not only firmly remember the great names of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People's Republic of China, but also firmly remember the great names of the German Democratic Republic, the Polish People's Republic, the Czechoslovak People's Republic, the Hungarian People's Republic, the Romanian People's Republic, the Bulgarian People's Republic, and the Albanian People's Republic in Europe. In Asia, we must also firmly remember the great names of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. These twelve revolutionary countries, headed by the Soviet Union, have a population of eight or nine hundred million. Therefore, we can say that today, the strength of the anti-imperialist democratic camp has exceeded the strength of the imperialist anti-democratic camp.
    Of course, underestimating the enemy should not be allowed, and fearing the enemy should not be allowed either. This is another struggle on two fronts. Both oppose underestimating the enemy and oppose fearing the enemy. American imperialism, which has inherited the fascist traditions of Hitler and Goebbels, has a so-called "psychological warfare" or "ideological warfare" in its aggressive schemes. For several years, American imperialism has been clamoring for war all over the world, one of its purposes is nothing more than to create a threat and terror in a vain attempt to profit from it. In fact, in front of the people who are fighting for peace all over the world, these arrogant American imperialist war-mongers are like a group of hooligans, a few ruffians, relying on a few iron rulers in their hands, they want to fight and commit violence. How could Hitler, Mussolini, and Konoe Fumimaro not have swaggered and screamed in front of the people of the world for a while. Today, these American war-mongers think they are great, but weighing them, they are not much stronger than Hitler, Mussolini, and Konoe Fumimaro.
    We do not underestimate in the slightest the danger of American imperialism and its vassal states stepping up preparations to launch a new world war, nor do we underestimate in the slightest the destructiveness and cruelty contained in this war danger. However, we only feel hateful towards American imperialism and its vassal states, and do not feel afraid. Because we know that victory will always belong to us, we not only believe that American imperialism and its vassal states, if they dare to provoke a new world war, will suffer a devastating blow, just as they suffered defeat in the war of aggression against Korea. We also believe that before American imperialism and its vassal states launch a new world war, they will inevitably suffer heavy blows from the peace-loving people all over the world against the development of this war crisis. The old rule of "the devil is one foot high, and the Tao is one foot high" has long been invalid. What has replaced it is the new rule of "the devil is one foot high, and the Tao is ten feet high." If American imperialism attempts to raise the danger of war by one foot, the people of the world will raise the power of peace by ten feet.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people, under the banner of Mao Zedong, have become a strong bastion in the East of the anti-imperialist democratic camp for the people of the world for a year. In this year, the friendship, unity and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union have been increasingly consolidated and developed. The Soviet Union's support and assistance to the Chinese revolution has been consistent for thirty years since the October Revolution. Now it has developed into two great allied nations. We firmly believe that the friendship, unity and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union will certainly strengthen the forces of defending world peace a hundredfold, and will not be afraid of any threats from the American imperialist war-mongers. We will certainly be able to eliminate the armed intervention of American imperialism and liberate Taiwan. We will certainly be able to smash the provocative acts of American imperialism infringing on China's airspace and ensure the consolidation, security and peaceful construction of the people's motherland.

　　中苏友好与世界和平
    陈家康
    一九四九年世界政治中第一件重大事情，就是中华人民共和国的成立。由于中华人民共和国的成立，使得反帝国主义民主营垒与帝国主义反民主营垒的力量对比，发生了基本的变化。同时，由于中华人民共和国的成立，中国人民才能与苏联人民完全团结起来。中苏两国人民团结起来，背靠着背，一方面面向欧洲，替欧洲爱好和平的人民作后盾；一方面面向亚洲，替亚洲爱好和平的人民作后盾。全世界爱好和平的人民均为此而兴奋。这样一来，在反帝国主义的斗争中，造成了空前未有的有利形势。
    然而，这种空前未有的有利形势，由于发展得太快，还未被有些人充分认识。这就是说，还有一种意见，把日益增长着的反帝国主义民主营垒的力量，估计得过低。同时，又把经过第一次世界战争和第二次世界战争严重削弱了的帝国主义反民主营垒的力量，估计得过高。在这里，必须回答一个问题：在目前世界政治中，究竟是以帝国主义反民主营垒的力量为决定因素呢？还是以反帝国主义民主营垒的力量为决定因素？毫无疑义，日益增长着的反帝国主义民主营垒的力量，在目前世界政治中，业已成为最重大的决定因素。我们不仅要牢牢记住苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟与中华人民共和国这两个伟大的名字，同时在欧洲方面，还要牢牢记住德意志民主共和国、波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克人民共和国、匈牙利人民共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国，保加利亚人民共和国，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国这些伟大的名字。在亚洲方面，还要牢牢记住朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，蒙古人民共和国、越南民主共和国这些伟大的名字。在这以苏联为首的十二个革命国家中，拥有八、九万万人口，因此，我们可以说：今天，反帝国主义民主营垒的力量，业已超过帝国主义反民主营垒的力量。
    当然，轻敌观念是不应该有的，同时，恐敌观念也不应该有。这又是一个两条战线的斗争。既反对轻敌，又反对恐敌。继承了希特勒、戈培尔那种法西斯传统的美帝国主义，在其侵略阴谋中，就有所谓“心理战争”，或者说“思想战争”那一条。几年来，美帝国主义在全世界叫嚣战争，其目的之一，无非是妄想造成一种威胁与恐怖，以便从中渔利。其实，在全世界为和平而斗争的人民面前，这般妄自尊大的美帝国主义战争贩子，却活像一群流氓，几个泼皮，仗着手中有几根铁尺，就想打架行凶而已。希特勒、莫索里尼、近卫文麿之流，又何尝没有在全世界人民面前撒野放泼、乱叫乱闹一阵子。今天，这般美国战争贩子，自以为了不起，掂掂分量也不比希特勒、莫索里尼、近卫文麿之流强多少。
    我们丝毫也不过低估计美帝国主义及其仆从国家加紧准备发动新的世界战争的危险，丝毫也不过低估计这种战争危险中所包含的破坏性与残酷性。然而，我们对于美帝国主义及其仆从国家，只觉可恨，不觉可怕。因为我们知道胜利始终是属于我们的，我们不仅相信：美帝国主义及其仆从国家，如果敢于挑起新的世界战争，就会遭受毁灭性的打击，正如他们在侵略朝鲜的战争中所遭受的失败一样。我们更相信：美帝国主义及其仆从国家，在其尚未发动新的世界战争之前，必然遭受全世界爱好和平的人民，对于此项战争危机的发展，加以重重的阻击。“道高一尺，魔高一丈”的旧规律，早已失效。代之而起是“魔高一尺，道高一丈”的新规律。美帝国主义企图把战争的危险提高一尺，全世界人民就会把和平的力量提高一丈。
    由于中华人民共和国的成立，中国人民得以在毛泽东旗帜之下，成为全世界人民反帝国主义民主营垒在东方的一个坚强营垒，已经一年。在这一年中，中苏两国人民的友好、团结与合作，日益获得巩固与发展。苏联对于中国革命的支援与协助，从十月革命起，三十年来如一日。到现在已经发展成为两大同盟国家。我们深信：中苏两国人民的友好、团结与合作，一定能够千百倍加强保卫世界和平的力量，而不怕美帝国主义战争贩子们的任何威胁。我们一定能够排除美帝国主义的武装干涉，解放台湾。我们一定能够粉碎美帝国主义侵犯中国领空的挑衅行为，保障人民祖国的巩固、安全与和平建设。
