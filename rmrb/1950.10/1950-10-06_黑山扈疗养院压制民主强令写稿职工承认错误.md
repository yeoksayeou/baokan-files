To the Editor:

　　After the People's Forum published an article on August 4th about the Black Mountain Hug Rehabilitation Center's illegal obstruction of union activities, the center's authorities not only did not examine their actions but instead fired and transferred some of the veteran employees who organized the union and participated in signing and submitting articles. I believe that the center's actions are extremely wrong, so I am informing you of this situation and hope it will be published.

　　On the evening of August 6th, Chen Zhaolong, the director of the center, Lou Dongming, the secretary, and Li Yongxiang, the personnel director, rushed from the city to convene a meeting of the front mountain employees. The director said that the rear mountain employees' submission of articles to the newspaper was a disruptive action that damaged his reputation. He immediately forced the veteran employees who signed the articles, Zhuang Yongzhen, Kang Baibaiwan, Shi Zhaoqing, and Liu Jingyun, to confess their mistakes. On the morning of the 7th, Dr. He Yanlin returned from the city and met Director Chen on the way. Director Chen even threatened Dr. He, saying, "You just came to work at the center, and you are already mixing with the rear mountain employees. You need to seriously consider your future."

　　Dr. He Yanlin took office in late July. Because of his relatively progressive thinking, he was elected as the director of the study committee by the rear mountain employees. He usually actively led the employees in their studies and strongly advocated for the establishment of a democratic center affairs committee. During the studies, the employees criticized the center's undemocratic system, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the center's authorities. On August 22nd, Director Chen Zhaolong fired Dr. He, stating the reason as: "After investigation, Comrade He is not qualified during his probation period, and according to regulations, his work should be terminated immediately, and he should leave the center..."

　　We believe that the center's dismissal of Dr. He, who actively led the employees in their studies and advocated for democratic reforms, is completely unjustified. During Dr. He's tenure, the majority of patients believed that he had a good sense of responsibility in his work and that his treatment methods were relatively diverse. He was considered a relatively good doctor in the entire center. The employees and patients, in order to retain Dr. He, requested that the center's authorities acknowledge their mistakes and retract their decision, but the center has not yet done so. Later, they promised to continue paying Dr. He's salary until he found another job, but this was just empty talk.

　　In addition to firing Dr. He, the center also transferred eight employees who actively engaged in labor movement work out of the center under the guise of "study." On September 5th, the director of the center forced four nursing students (one who had gone home and not yet returned) to apply to the Central Military Commission's Ministry of Health Intermediate Cadre School. They were afraid of failing the exam and requested that the center keep their luggage temporarily, but the director of the center forced them to move their luggage immediately. As a result, they all shed tears when they left.

　　After this incident occurred, all the employees in the center showed panic and unease. We hope that the relevant authorities will promptly investigate and handle this matter.

　　Dr. He Yanlin's Letter of Accusation

To the Editor:

　　After the People's Forum published the facts and truth about the center's illegal obstruction of union activities on August 4th, the director summoned our three attending physicians for individual talks on the 5th. He said to me: "Dr. He, we gave you a very high position and treatment here because of the introducer's reputation. I know you have participated in a lot of revolutionary work, and I hope you can help us. You have only been here for a short time and don't know much about the situation in the center. Don't just listen to those troublemakers and patients in the rear mountain. The newspaper's criticism has made me very painful, and my reputation and position have suffered great losses. I hope you can help me correct their mistakes. If you can agree, I will appoint you as the director of the rear mountain and send you abroad for research in the future." I put forward suggestions for improving the center's affairs and repeatedly requested to be transferred to work in the front mountain, but was never allowed. On the morning of the 7th, I returned to the mountain and met Director Chen on the road. He said to me: "Dr. He, there was a mass meeting in the center (referring to the front mountain) last night. All the employees believe that the newspaper's criticism has damaged my reputation and the rehabilitation center's reputation and position. How can I face the directors? These people who wrote the articles are too unreasonable. I must fire Shen Zhenqi, who is the ringleader. It's either him or me, either me or him." I advised him to be cautious, but he said, "As long as Shen Zhenqi, Guan Huai'ren, and others declare their mistakes in the newspaper to restore and correct my reputation and position, I can avoid firing them."

　　On the 22nd, I took sick leave and returned home to rest. On the 23rd, I suddenly received a registered letter from Director Chen Zhaolong from the city office, dismissing me.

　　After I was illegally dismissed, the employees requested that the center retain me. My colleague, Dr. Wu Zhibao, and Dr. Jiang (who has now left) also came forward to mediate, and the director personally promised: (1) The director acknowledges his mistakes and retracts his decision; (2) He is responsible for recommending me to be a lecturer at the North China Military Medical University; (3) Before going to the Military Medical University, the center will continue to pay my salary and issue a one-month transfer subsidy when I leave. I agreed to consider it.

　　Now, Chen Zhaolong has overturned all the previous agreements, which shows that he was deceiving me at the time. I am submitting my accusation against the center to you and request that you investigate and handle it immediately. Best regards,

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　He Yanlin

　　The Center Inspects and Detains Employees' Letters, Illegally Obstructing Freedom of Communication

To the Editor:

　　The authorities of the Black Mountain Hug Rehabilitation Center have repeatedly confiscated, inspected, and detained letters to and from patients and employees, depriving them of their freedom of communication. Here are a few important examples:

　　1. Around August 25th, after learning about the center's dismissal of Dr. He Yanlin, the Xijiao Thirteenth District Union Office immediately sent a letter to our rehabilitation committee responsible comrade and Dr. He himself. This letter was inspected and confiscated by the center.

　　2. On September 7th, patient Zou Guofu submitted an article to the People's Daily, reflecting the center's negligence of human life. This article was given to a rickshaw worker on the same afternoon to be taken to the city. The worker, seeing that the envelope did not have a stamp, suspected that the sender had forgotten to affix it and gave the letter to the center's city office, where it was confiscated.

　　3. At the end of July, the Thirteenth District Union Office sent a letter to Guan Huai'ren, an employee of the center, asking him to come to the union for a discussion, which was also confiscated by Liu Songbo, the center's mail clerk.

　　4. At the end of June, Yin Bolan wrote a letter asking her organization to buy medicine for her because the center charged too much for medicine. This letter was illegally inspected by the center, and the prescription was confiscated.

### 黑山扈疗养院压制民主强令写稿职工承认错误

　　黑山扈疗养院压制民主强令写稿职工承认错误编辑同志：
    八月四日人民园地登载黑山扈疗养院院方非法阻挠工会活动后，该院当局不但不加检讨，反面把一部分组织工会与参加签名投稿的老职工开除和调走。我觉得院方这种作为是十分错误的，特将这一情况告诉你们，并望发表。
    八月六日晚，该院院长陈兆龙、秘书娄东明、人事主任李永祥，匆忙地从城里赶来，召集前山职工开会。院长说后山职工向报纸投稿是捣乱的行动，破坏他的名誉，当即强迫投稿签名的老职工庄永珍、康百万、石兆庆、刘景云坦白承认错误。七日晨何彦琳大夫从城里回来，中途碰到陈院长。陈院长竟威胁何大夫说：“你刚来到院里工作，就与后山职工混在一起，你要好好的考虑考虑你的前途。”
    何彦琳大夫于七月下旬到职，因思想比较进步，被后山职工选为学委会主任。他平时积极领导职工学习，并力主组织民主的院务委员会。职工在学习中批评了院方的不民主制度，因而引起院方的不满。八月二十二日，院长陈兆龙竟开除何大夫，理由是：“查何同志在试用期间，经本院审查并不合格，照章应自即日起终止工作，脱离本院。……”
    我们认为，院方把积极领导职工学习、主张民主改革的何大夫开除，是毫无理由的，因为在何大夫任职期间，多数患者都认为他的工作责任心较好，治疗办法也比较多，在全院说来是一位比较好的大夫。职工和患者为挽留何大夫，曾要求院方承认错误，收回成命，但院方迄未实行。后又答应在何大夫未找到职业以前仍由院方发薪，但这也是一句空话。
    该院除开除何大夫外，并以“学习”为名，将积极从事工运工作的八名职工调出该院。九月五日，该院院长强令四个护理学生（一名回家尚未返院）投考中央军委卫生部中级干部学校。她们怕考不上，请求院方把行李暂时留在院里，但该院院长竟强迫她们立即把行李搬走。因此，临走时她们都掉了眼泪。
    此事发生后，全院职工都表现了恐慌与不安。希望有关方面迅速调查处理。

　　何彦琳大夫来信控诉编辑同志：
    八月四日人民园地发表了院方非法阻挠工会活动的事实与真相以后，院长曾于五日召集我们三位主治大夫进行了个别谈话，他对我说：“何大夫，你到这里工作，我们看在介绍人的面上，给你很高的地位及待遇。我知道你参加过不少革命工作，希望你能帮助我们。你刚来不久，对院内的情况不很了解，切不要片面听从后山那些倒蛋分子及病人的话。报纸批评的事，使我很痛心，我的名誉地位受了很大损失，望你能帮助我纠正他们的错误。如果你能答应我的话，我即委派你为后山主任，将来还可送你到外国去研究。”我提出了改进院务的建议，同时再三要求调派前山工作，始终未被允许。七日早晨回山，在路上碰到陈院长。他对我说：“何大夫，昨天晚上院中（指前山）开了一个群众大会，全体职工都认为报纸的批评损坏了我和疗养院的信誉和地位，我还有什么面子去见各董事呢？这些写稿的人太不讲情理了，我一定要开除带头的沈震岐。有他无我，有我无他。”我劝他应慎重一点，但他却说：“只要沈震岐、关怀仁等再在报上声明错误，以挽回及纠正我的名誉、地位，可以不开除他们。”
    二十二日我因病请假回家休养，二十三日突接陈兆龙院长由城内事务所寄来双挂号信一封，他开除了我。
    我被非法开除以后，职工们曾要求院方挽留我，同事吴之宝大夫和姜大夫（现又离去）亦出面调解，并经院长亲口答应：（一）院长承认错误，收回成命；（二）负责保送我到华北军医大学做讲师；（三）在未到军医大学前仍由院方发给薪津，离职时发调动补助费一月。我答应考虑。
    现在，陈兆龙已将以前协议全部推翻，这说明了当时他是欺骗我的。我向你们提出我对该院的控诉，并要求你们能立即调查处理。此致敬礼

　　院方检扣职工信件非法妨碍通讯自由编辑同志：
    黑山扈疗养院院方一再没收、检查和扣压病员和职工的来往信件，使得他们失去了通信自由。现把几个重要的例子写在下面：
    一、八月二十五日左右，西郊十三区工会办事处知道该院开除大夫何彦琳的事情以后，当即向我们疗委会负责同志和何大夫本人各发一信，此信被院方检查后没收了。
    二、九月七日患者邹果夫同志，向人民日报投了一个稿子，反映该院玩忽人命的现象。此稿于当日下午交三轮工人带到城里。这位工人见信封上没有邮票，疑是发信者忘贴，把信交给该院城内事务所，结果就被没收了。
    三、七月底十三区工会办事处曾给该院职工关怀仁一信，叫他到工会谈话，亦被该院收发刘松波没收了。
    四、六月底尹波兰同志因该院在药品方面收费太多，写信叫机关代她买药，竟被院方非法检查，并将药单没收。
