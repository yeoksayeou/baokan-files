How to Calculate the Normal Annual Yield and Land Area
　　 
Peng Xiaofan

The "Regulations on Standards for Determining Agricultural Tax Land Area and Normal Annual Yield" were promulgated and implemented on September 17th. The agricultural tax in the new areas is "levied on a progressive basis per household, based on the average agricultural income per agricultural person." The calculation of agricultural income is "based on the normal annual yield of the land as the standard." Therefore, unifying the calculation standards for land area and normal annual yield is the foundation for correctly implementing the agricultural tax law in the newly liberated areas. The document also states that these "Regulations" not only apply to the newly liberated areas, but also to the old areas, so these "Regulations" have national significance.

China has a vast territory with complex situations, different natural conditions of land, and different operating conditions. In addition, the system of weights and measures is not uniform, and the work foundation is inconsistent. It is not easy to unify the calculation standards for land area and normal annual yield. Now, I would like to discuss some specific issues in the "Regulations."

(1) What is "Normal Year"?

"Land yield is based on the normal annual yield as the standard," but what is "normal year"? There are different opinions:

Some say: "Six to eight out of ten years can be called a normal year." In this way, if the yield is assessed according to eight out of ten years in area A and according to six out of ten years in area B, the output will differ by a quarter, and it will be difficult to balance the burden; some people reflect that "the distance between six to eight is too great."

Some say: "The average of the last four or five years is the normal year" or "the highest yield in recent years is considered the normal year." Others say: "Normal year is eight out of ten years, calculated by deducting eight from the harvest of ten out of ten bumper years, which is the normal year yield." However, practical experience proves that China's agricultural production technology is backward, and natural conditions such as climate, water conservancy, and soil quality are different. Some land yields are guaranteed every year, while some land yields are not guaranteed due to uneven drought and flood. Therefore, the above-mentioned rigid regulations are difficult to calculate accurately and do not conform to the actual situation.

Some say: "The usual harvest of the year is the normal annual yield." This actually becomes the current year's yield rather than the normal annual yield. Calculating and levying according to the current year's yield may be suitable for the current year if done well, but it will inevitably require annual investigations and annual changes, which is cumbersome; and it will lead to more collection and more taxation, which will affect farmers' production enthusiasm, so it is not appropriate.

According to our field experience in yield assessment: "Normal year" is the usual year in the local area, neither a special bumper year with favorable weather nor a year of crop failure due to uneven drought and flood. This seems too abstract, but "normal year" has a habitual concept in the minds of the masses, and when discussed seriously with the farmers, it will become very concrete. But one thing must be noted, that is, when assessing the yield according to the normal year, the masses often worry about what to do in the event of a famine or crop failure. Therefore, the policy of reduction and exemption must be clarified and announced to the masses. Otherwise, the farmers will deduct a disaster reduction number when assessing the yield, making it difficult to assess the true yield.

(2) The combination of natural conditions of the land and local general operating conditions and planting habits

Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations stipulates: "'Normal annual yield' refers to the yield that various lands should harvest throughout the year under normal year conditions, according to their natural conditions and local general operating conditions and planting habits." This indicates that there are three bases for assessing land yield: (1) natural conditions of the land, such as soil quality, water conservancy, terrain (high, low, flat), climate, wind direction, sunlight, etc., which are the main basis for setting the yield; (2) local general operating conditions, that is, the labor, animal power, fertilizer, and cultivation techniques applied to the land by local general farmers; (3) planting habits, that is, the number of times and the crops planted by general farmers throughout the year. The normal annual yield of various lands is the concentrated expression of these three.

However, in the actual yield assessment, there have been deviations in the past that mechanically separated these three conditions and emphasized one side:

First: Some areas have had a bias towards simply emphasizing yield assessment based on operating conditions: starting from the quality of life, higher assessment for wealthy households and lower assessment for poor households; or starting from the quality of crops, higher assessment for good management and lower assessment for poor management (households lacking farm implements or labor); the excuse is "to adapt to the ability to bear the burden." This completely violates the principle of rewarding diligent production, so it is wrong. The masses fully agree with taking care of the families of martyrs, soldiers, workers, and the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed who are living in poverty in terms of burden (appropriately reducing or exempting their tax amount), but are very dissatisfied with the practice of "assessing yield by looking at crops." Therefore, we must pay attention to prevent this.

Second: Some areas have had a bias towards simply emphasizing yield assessment based on natural conditions. It is believed that yield assessment can only be based on the "floor," and if operating conditions are referred to, it will inevitably打击 (dǎjī - strike a blow to) production. This statement is also not comprehensive. Because operating conditions and natural conditions are combined with each other and cannot be mechanically separated, the quality of operation can promote the change of natural conditions, such as "water conservancy," which belongs to natural conditions according to regulations, but digging wells and opening canals in dry land originally belonged to artificial operation, and after a long time of practice, the natural conditions of the land will be improved; secondly, farmers' operation of land is focused, and water land and good land are generally fertilized more and operated carefully, while dry land and bad land are fertilized less and operated roughly; if operating conditions are not taken into account, the result will be that good land is particularly favored and bad land is particularly disadvantaged, making it无人耕种 (wú rén gēngzhòng - no one cultivates) bad land and turning it into wasteland, which is also very unfavorable for production. Therefore, although the natural conditions of the land are basic and major, they cannot be based only on the "floor." The land of different types such as fields, land, mountains, and ponds, or water, dry, sandy, and alkaline, or different grades of land such as first-class and second-class, must be combined with the natural conditions of each category and each grade and the operating conditions and planting habits (one crop a year, two crops a year, or three crops in two years, etc.) of local general farmers (not individual households or a few households), so that the work of assessing yield will not deviate.

(3) Staple Food and Yield Conversion Rate

The "Regulations" point out: "The normal annual yield should be converted into staple food for calculation. Staple food refers to the most planted grain in the local area (such as millet in North China, sorghum in Northeast China, rice in South China, wheat in Northwest China, etc.). The conversion ratio of various crops to staple food shall be stipulated by the provincial (municipal) people's government and reported to the people's government (military and political committee) of the greater administrative region for verification." The purpose of this regulation is to enable the assessed yield to correctly reflect the national wealth, so as to actively regulate and balance the burden. Because the collection of agricultural tax is based on the local staple food, other grains must be converted into staple food for calculation. If the conversion is not made during the yield assessment, the nominal burden and the actual burden of the farmers will be inconsistent, affecting the balance of burden in various places. According to the experience of the North China region, the formulation of the yield conversion rate should be based on the following principles: (1) taking into account both public and private interests; (2) the collection conversion ratio is consistent with the yield assessment conversion ratio; (3) calculated according to the general price ratio of various grains in the local area.

Some advocate that the original grain should be assessed for yield and the original grain should be collected without conversion: "Plant what, assess what, collect what." However, because the collection of grain types cannot be completely based on "民有 (mín yǒu - what the people have)," but also take care of "国需 (guó xū - what the country needs)," it is difficult for the collection types in a region to be completely consistent with the planting area and yield of various crops. For example, if a certain place produces 20% sweet potatoes, the state cannot guarantee to collect 20% sweet potatoes in that place. Of course, if the conversion to staple food is misunderstood as assessing the yield of staple food, such as in areas in Jiangnan that do not produce rice, it is naturally wrong to insist on assessing the yield according to rice. "Plant what, assess what," and then convert it into staple food for calculation is the correct way.

In areas with summer harvests, in order to facilitate the separate calculation of the summer and autumn seasons, the proportion of the summer harvest normal annual yield to the total annual yield can be assessed when assessing the normal annual yield, as the basis for determining the percentage of the summer levy in the total annual levy each year, so as to avoid investigating and assessing during the summer levy every year, wasting time, and affecting the production enthusiasm of the masses.

In addition, the "Regulations" point out: "The stalks and straws of each season's crops shall not be included in the harvest," which is based on the principle that by-products are not taxed. Some areas (mainly rice-producing areas in Jiangnan) regard other crops (such as wheat and beans) other than the staple food (rice) as "by-products" and do not calculate the yield, which is wrong.

(4) Unification of Land Area Calculation Units

The calculation units of land area in China are extremely inconsistent. Some are based on "亩 (mǔ)," some are based on "垧 (shàng)," some are based on "石 (dàn)" or "斗 (dǒu)," and some are based on "运 (yùn)" or "双 (shuāng)." Among them, "亩" is more common, but the size varies. According to incomplete statistics in Shandong Province, there are as many as eleven kinds! In order to facilitate the control of burden balance, the "Regulations" point out: The land area shall be based on 市亩 (shì mǔ - city mu) as the basic unit. However, according to the experience of the North China region, the habits of the masses are not easy to change at one time, so "in areas where 市亩 (shì mǔ - city mu) has not yet been popularized, the registration of districts and villages may temporarily be based on the local customary '亩 (mǔ)' or '垧 (shàng)' as the unit, and the county (city) people's government shall convert it into 市亩 (shì mǔ - city mu) and fill in the report in a list." This is completely correct.

In terms of conversion methods, the following steps can be followed for calculation: first, clarify how many square 市尺 (shì chǐ - city feet) each customary 亩 (mǔ) is equivalent to, and then divide it by 6,000 square 市尺 (shì chǐ - city feet) (the number of square 市尺 (shì chǐ - city feet) per 市亩 (shì mǔ - city mu)) to obtain the number of 市亩 (shì mǔ - city mu) each customary 亩 (mǔ) is equivalent to. Multiply this number by the total number of customary 亩 (mǔ) of land in the county to obtain the total number of 市亩 (shì mǔ - city mu) of land in the county. If the local customary 亩 (mǔ) is calculated according to customary 尺 (chǐ - feet), the conversion should be made by first converting each customary 尺 (chǐ - feet) into 市尺 (shì chǐ - city feet), then squaring the converted 市尺 (shì chǐ - city feet) number to find the number of square customary 尺 (chǐ - feet) converted into square 市尺 (shì chǐ - city feet), and then converting it into 市亩 (shì mǔ - city mu) according to the above method. This conversion method should be mastered by the county. If the village carries out the conversion, it will cause confusion.

　　怎样计算常年应产量及土地面积
    彭晓帆
    “农业税土地面积及常年应产量订定标准的规定”，已于九月十七日公布施行。新区农业税，是“以户为单位，按农业人口每人平均农业收入累进计征”的。而农业收入的计算，则“以土地的常年应产量为标准”。因此，统一土地面积和常年应产量的计算标准，乃是正确执行新解放区农业税法的基础。文件中且说明：此项“规定”不仅适用于新解放区，同样也适用于老区，所以这个“规定”是具有全国意义的。
    我国幅员辽阔，情况复杂，土地的自然条件不同，经营情况亦异，再加上度量衡制度不统一，工作基础不一致，统一土地面积和常年应产量的计算标准，实非易事。兹特就“规定”中几个具体问题，提出来谈谈。
    （一）什么叫“常年”？
    “土地产量以常年应产量为标准”，但什么叫“常年”呢？说法不一：
    有的说：“六成到八成年景即可称为常年”。这样，甲地按八成年景评产，乙地按六成年景评产，则产量相差四分之一，负担难求平衡；有人反映：“六成到八成距离太大。”
    有的说：“近四、五年的平均年成就是常年”或“近几年来为数最高的年成就算常年。”也有的说：“常年就是八成年景，以十成丰收年景收获量的八扣计算，即为常年产量。”但实际经验证明：中国农业生产技术落后，气候、水利、土质等自然条件各不相同，某些土地年年保收，而某些土地则旱涝不均收成难保。所以上述硬性的规定，既难于精确计算、且不符实际情况。
    有的说：“当年通常的收获量就是常年产量。”这实际变成当年产量而非常年产量了。按当年产量计算征收，做的好了，可能适合当年的情况，但势必年年调查，年年更改，不胜其烦；且会形成多收多征，影响农民生产情绪，因此是不妥当的。
    根据我们在评产中实地体验：“常年”就是当地的平常年成，既不是风调雨顺特殊的丰年，也不是旱涝不均的歉年。这样好像太抽象，但“常年”在群众脑子里却有一个习惯的概念，与农民认真商量起来时，就会变成很具体的东西了。但有一点必须注意，即按常年评产时，群众往往会顾虑荒年歉收时怎么办，因此，便必须明确减免政策，并向群众宣布。不然，农民便会在评产量时扣下一个灾情减收数，使产量难以评到真实。
    （二）土地的自然条件和当地一般经营条件及种植习惯的结合
    暂行条例第六条规定：“‘常年应产量’是指：各种土地根据其自然条件和当地一般经营条件及种植习惯，在平常年成下，全年所应收获的产量”。这就指明：评订土地产量的根据有三，（一）土地的自然条件如土质、水利、地势（高、洼、平坦）、气候、风向、阳光等，这是订产的主要根据；（二）当地一般经营条件，即当地一般农户对土地所施劳力、畜力，肥料、及耕作技术等；（三）种植习惯，即一般农户全年种植的次数和种植的作物。各种土地的常年应产量，便是这三者的集中表现。
    但是，在实际评产量当中，过去曾发生过把这三个条件机械分开、强调一面的偏向：
    第一：有的地区曾发生单纯强调按经营情况评订产量的偏向：从生活好坏着眼，富裕的户评的高，贫苦的户评的低；或者从庄稼长的好坏着眼，经营好的评的高，经营差的（缺乏农具或无劳力户）评的低；其借口是“适应负担能力”。这就完全违背了奖励勤劳生产的原则，因此是错误的。群众对烈、军、工属及老、弱、孤、寡等生活贫困的，在负担上加以照顾（适当减免其税额），是完全同意的，但对“看庄稼评产量”的作法则非常不满。因此必须注意防止。
    第二：有的地区发生过单纯强调按自然条件评订产量的偏向。以为评产量只能按“地板”，若参照经营条件，势必打击生产，这种说法也不全面。因为经营条件与自然条件是相互结合的，不能机械分开，经营的好坏，可以促使自然条件的改变，如“水利”一项，依照规定属于自然条件，但旱地凿井开渠，原属人工经营，习之已久，土地的自然条件便随之改良；其次，农民的经营土地是有重点的，水地、好地，一般是施肥多，经营细致，旱地、坏地，则施肥少，经营粗；若不顾经营条件，结果便是好地特别沾光，坏地特别吃亏，弄得坏地无人耕种，变成荒地，对于生产也是很不利的。因此，土地的自然条件虽是基本的、主要的，但不能只按“地板”。田、地、山荡，或水、旱、沙、碱等不同类别的土地，或一等地二等地……等不同等级的土地，必须按各该类、各该级的自然条件和当地一般农民（不是个别户或少数户）的经营条件、种植习惯（一年一季、一年二季或二年三季等）结合起来，才能使评订产量的工作，不致发生偏差。
    （三）主粮及订产折合率
    “规定”中指出：“常年应产量应折合主粮计算。主粮是指：当地种植最多的谷物（如华北的粟谷，东北的高粱，江南的稻谷，西北的小麦等）各种作物与主粮折合比例，由省（市）人民政府规定，报请大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）核定之。”这个规定的目的在使评定的产量能正确反映国民的富力，俾积极调剂与平衡负担。因为农业税的征收，以当地主粮为主，其他粮食均须折合主粮计算。如果订产时不予折合，便使农民的名义负担与实际负担不一致，影响各地负担的平衡。根据华北区的经验，订产折合率的拟订应本以下原则：（一）公私兼顾；（二）征收折合比例与订产折合比例相一致；（三）按照当地各种粮食一般比价计算。
    有的主张原粮订产原粮征收互不折合：“种什么，评什么，征什么。”但因征收粮种不能完全依照“民有”，还要照顾“国需”，因此，一个地区的征收种类就很难完全与各种作物播种面积及产量相一致。如某地出产百分之二十的甘薯，国家就不可能在该地保证征收百分之二十的甘薯。当然，如果把折合主粮误解为评议主粮的产量，如江南不产稻谷地区，硬要按稻谷评议产量，自然是不对的。“种什么，评什么”，然后再折合主粮计算，才是正确的。
    在有夏收的地区，为便于夏秋两季分别计算，可于评订常年产量时，把夏收常年产量占全年总产量的比例评出来，作为每年确定夏征占全年征收量百分比的依据，免得每年夏征中调查评议、耽误时间，且影响群众生产情绪。
    另外，“规定”中指出：“各季作物的秸杆、禾草不计入收获之内”，这是根据副产物不征税的原则。有些地区（主要是江南产稻区）把主粮（稻谷）以外的其它作物（如小麦、豆类）都当作“副产物”，不计算产量，这是不对的。
    （四）土地面积计算单位的统一
    中国土地面积的计算单位，极不一致。有论“亩”的、论“垧”的，有论“石”或“斗”的，也有论“运”论“双”的。其中以“亩”为较普遍，但大小又各不同，据山东省不完全的统计，即达十一种之多！为便于掌握负担平衡，“规定”中指出：土地面积以市亩为基本单位。但根据华北区经验，群众的习惯，不易于一时改变，故“在市亩尚未通行的地区，区、村登记，得暂以当地习惯‘亩’或‘垧’为单位，由县（市）人民政府折合市亩，列表填报。”这是完全正确的。
    在折合方法上，可依下列步骤计算：先弄清当地每习惯亩折合多少方市尺，再以六、○○○方市尺（每市亩折方市尺数）除之，即得出每习惯亩折合市亩数、将此数、乘全县土地的习惯亩总数，即得出全县土地折合市亩总数。如果当地习惯亩是按习惯尺计算的，应先将每习惯尺折为市尺，次将折合市尺数自乘，求出每方习惯尺折合方市尺数，再依上述办法折合市亩。这个折合方法应由县掌握，如由村进行折合，就会造成混乱现象。
