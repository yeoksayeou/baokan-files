　　Bureaucracy in Jiyuan County's Lumbering of Support Poles
　　--A Typical Report from the Third Party Congress of Pingyuan Province
　　Last year, Jiyuan County in Pingyuan Province suffered a rather severe disaster. The average harvest for the entire county was only 30%, and the people's lives were very difficult. Production and disaster relief were urgent tasks at the time. On the border of Jiyuan and Yangcheng and Yicheng in Shanxi, there was a large forest, extending over a hundred li from east to west and thirty to forty li from north to south. Part of it was temple property, and some had been distributed to the masses during the land reform in 1948. Last year, the leading organs felt that distributing it to the masses was inappropriate and that it should be returned to state ownership, but it was not formally taken back. In November of last year, the county party committee, based on the principle of "relying on the mountains for sustenance and relying on the water for sustenance," signed a contract with the state-owned Xinhua Company to cut down 100,000 support poles with the help of the Xinxiang Special District. The contract stipulated that each support pole should be six inches in diameter and seven feet long, to be completed in three months. Upon completion, the masses could earn 900,000 catties of millet.

　　Before signing this contract, the county party committee's understanding of the forest situation, apart from a general abstract concept, was based on the feedback from a staff member of the Xinxiang Special District who had returned from the mountain. The county had never conducted any investigation or research. The contract was signed after consultation among a few responsible cadres, without consulting with other cadres or the masses, and without carefully studying the state's policy of protecting forests. They only thought that this was a good way to engage in production and disaster relief, and that there was no other way to do production and disaster relief without doing this, harboring a purely relief-oriented and condescending viewpoint. Therefore, they committed serious bureaucracy and commandism, causing serious damage to state property and the interests of the masses.

　　This contract itself had the following problems:

　　(1) The signing of this contract treated the demands of a few people as the demands of the broad masses, violating the will of the majority of the masses. In the four villages relying on the mountains, the harvest was relatively good last year, but the land was small and of poor quality. Although the masses had the desire to engage in sideline production and possessed the skills to cut trees, they were not enthusiastic about cutting support poles because the profits were small (at that time, carrying a 12-foot-long purlin could be sold for 10 catties of grain, but carrying a 7-foot-long support pole could only earn 5 catties of grain). Only a small number of people forced by life were willing to cut. The masses in the plains suffered serious famine and lived a very difficult life. They had demands for production and disaster relief, but they did not have the skills to cut trees, lacked the habit of climbing mountains, and were unwilling to cut forests. Therefore, the contract itself lacked a broad mass base.

　　(2) Insufficient understanding of the forest situation, lack of accurate calculations and careful planning. It was difficult to complete the contract of 100,000 support poles. Because at that time, only 50,000 poles could be cut on the front mountain, and the rest had to be cut on the back mountain. The back mountain was far away and difficult to travel, requiring a journey of 40 li through the mountains each time, a round trip of 80 li. Each person could only carry one support pole (70 catties) down the mountain each day, earning 5 catties of grain. According to the forest situation and the distance, it was calculated that 80,000 laborers were required to cut and transport 100,000 support poles from the mountain. Calculating 70 catties per pole, the total was 7,000,000 catties. Each large cart could carry 1,000 catties at a time, requiring a total of 7,000 carts to transport it all. The entire county could only mobilize 400 carts. Each cart would have to transport 17 times, taking six days each time, for a total of 102 days to complete the task. Even with this calculation, the time for cloudy and snowy days and the rest time for people and animals had not been taken into account, while the contract stipulated a period of only three months. This shows that the contract itself was divorced from reality, thus causing serious coercion and commandism.

　　How was it implemented?

　　From the beginning of November last year to the beginning of January this year was the first stage of the contract's execution. The first problem encountered was the issue of forest rights. Because part of the front mountain had been distributed to the masses during the land reform in 1948, although there had been a plan to return it to state ownership, it had not been formally taken back because the masses were dissatisfied. In order to fulfill the contract, the county party committee sent a county committee member to resolve the issue of forest rights, determining that private forests should be resolutely protected, and that the public forests that had been distributed to the masses, and that had been improved by private labor, could be cut by private individuals. The remainder could be allowed to be cut by the masses. After this was determined, the masses only cut 30,000 poles. 8,000 poles were transported down the mountain, and only 500 poles were transported to the Jiaozuo Coal Mine. Two months later, it was the Lunar New Year, and there was heavy snow, making the roads slippery and difficult to travel, and the work stopped.

　　At this time, the Xinxiang Special District issued a circular criticizing the Jiyuan County leadership for being "slow-moving bureaucrats, leading ineffectively, and progressing too slowly." Following this, the Pingyuan Daily also criticized the Jiyuan County leading organs for "serious bureaucracy, with the masses unable to obtain hundreds of thousands of catties of millet, causing widespread complaints." These two criticisms further promoted the development of bureaucracy and commandism (the prefectural committee, special commissioner's office, and newspaper office all conducted self-criticisms during this rectification movement - editor).

　　What was the attitude of the county party committee after being criticized?

　　First, they accepted the criticism with a bureaucratic attitude. Without examining whether there were conditions to complete the task, they only believed that it was "insufficient subjective effort and ineffective leadership by the cadres." Second, especially after being publicly criticized, they felt very embarrassed. In previous military conscriptions and wars, the tasks had been completed, so they blindly believed that the work had a foundation and the masses were conscious. How could 100,000 support poles not be completed? Third, they believed that a contract had been signed, and the coal mine was waiting for it. If it was not completed, not only would credibility be affected, but the coal mine would also suffer losses.

　　Due to these ideas, the leadership adopted a simplistic method of cutting support poles, and instead of persuading and mobilizing the masses, they coerced and ordered them. At that time, some district cadres reported to the county party committee that the masses generally felt that the profit was small, and with the spring plowing season approaching, they were unwilling to go. However, the county leaders did not seriously consider these opinions, and after making some explanations, they ordered: "Complete the task of 70,000 support poles within a month; not a day more, not a pole less. If it is not completed, the district head and the district secretary will be responsible." The county's bureaucratic attitude (and a serious commandist style - editor) prompted district cadres to adopt commandism towards the masses. District cadres "mobilized" more than 2,000 people to go up the mountain in less than a week. Some of the masses proposed: "Are you engaged in production for disaster relief, or is this a task? If it is production for disaster relief, we have no disaster here; if it is to complete a task, we have nothing to say! The Communist Party has led us to turn ourselves over, and we can go this once." The district cadres replied: "Half is for disaster relief, and half is for the task." As a result, many of the masses were assigned tasks according to their labor force. A wealthy peasant was assigned to go by the village, and he paid grain to hire someone to go, but he was turned back by the district cadres. He was required to go in person. Generally, some of the masses were also willing to hire people with grain to go. On the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, the masses were forced to go up the mountain to cut support poles even without celebrating the Spring Festival. After going up the mountain, due to a lack of organization and planning, they cut whatever they could get their hands on, regardless of whether it was public or private, fruit trees or forest trees. The people on the mountain were afraid of being cut by the people from down the mountain, and they also rushed to cut. A serious chaotic situation was formed. Two days later, the county sent cadres to stop it, but the damage had already been done. This time, a total of 40,000 support poles were cut, bringing the total to 70,000 poles together with the previous amount. The masses received a total of more than 300,000 catties of grain, because one-third of them were not up to standard, and the cut timber could not be exchanged for grain. At the same time, during this cutting of the forest, a total of 3,700 private trees were cut, including more than 80 fruit trees. Some of the masses from down the mountain who went up the mountain suffered serious violations of the interests of the masses because there were few houses, a shortage of drinking water, and a lack of organization. Some ate the cornmeal cakes of the masses on the mountain, and some ate white flour. This created antagonism between the masses on the mountain and the masses down the mountain. At the same time, the masses were very dissatisfied with the leadership. Some said: "Every day we are told to protect the trees, but now we are destroying the trees." Some said: "It's not disaster relief, it's taking our lives! The public is doing business, and we are suffering!" The migrant workers cutting support poles climbed dozens of li of mountains in freezing weather, suffering from cold and hunger. Some had their feet cut, and some became ill from the cold.

　　Jiyuan showed serious bureaucracy and commandism in this cutting of support poles: it seriously violated the party's policies and lines, seriously damaged state property and the interests of the masses, and caused antagonism between those on and off the mountain, affecting unity.

　　Why did the above errors occur?

　　According to the reviews and self-criticisms of the Jiyuan County Party Committee, the Xinxiang Prefectural Committee, and the Pingyuan Daily, there are the following issues: 1. Subjectivity and one-sidedness in ideological methods, failing to investigate and research, and relying on hearsay and impressions to do things. 2. Lack of a mass viewpoint and an attitude of wholeheartedly serving the people. They liked to do things in a sensational way, preferring to do big things rather than small things. For matters closely related to the interests of the broad masses, they did not consult with the masses, but a few people took care of everything. They did not seriously consider or study the opinions of the masses, but insisted on going their own way, resulting in serious detachment from the masses. 3. Serious bureaucratic style. They neither investigated and researched beforehand nor consulted with the masses. After being criticized, they did not calmly analyze and study the situation, but instead "heroically" "set a time limit for completion." 4. The criticisms from the prefectural committee and the newspaper were themselves lacking in a mass viewpoint. They only criticized Jiyuan for not completing the task, without considering whether it could be completed or how it should be completed, and did not send anyone to inspect it, thus further fueling the errors. 5. Blind felling without planning or organization. 6. There was a serious phenomenon of disorganization and lack of discipline. The county party committee, citing the inconvenience of contact, did not report matters that should have been reported to the prefectural committee, but instead worked blindly, and only asked for instructions when problems occurred.

　　Finally, how was the problem handled? After discovering the error, the leadership immediately ordered a halt. The county head personally admitted the error to the masses, and the county leading cadres also conducted a review at the People's Congress. In addition, they took out more than 5,400 catties of grain to compensate the masses whose trees had been cut.

　　济源县砍伐架木中的官僚主义
    ——平原省第三次党代会典型报告
    去年，平原省济源县的灾情相当严重，全县平均只有三成年景，群众生活很苦，生产救灾是当时迫切的任务。在济源与山西阳城、翼城的交界处，有个大山林，东西长百余里，南北宽三四十里。其中有一部分是庙产，在一九四八年土改时，已有一些分给了群众。去年领导机关感到分给群众不合适，应收归国有，但未正式收回。去年十一月份，该县县委根据靠山吃山，靠水吃水的方针，在新乡专署的帮助下，与国营新华公司订立了砍伐十万根架木的合同。合同规定每根架木六英寸直径，七尺长，三个月的时间完成。完成后，群众可收入小米九十万斤。
    这个合同在签订前，县委对山林的情况的了解，除了平时有个抽象概念之外，就是根据新乡专署的一个科员从山上回来的反映，县里从未作调查研究。订立合同只是少数负责干部商量了一下，未和干部商量，又未和群众商量，也未很好研究国家保护山林的政策；只认为这是一种生产救灾的好门路，不这样做，生产救灾就没有办法，存在着单纯的救济观点和恩赐观点。因此犯了严重的官僚主义与命令主义，使国家财产与群众利益受到严重损失。
    这个合同本身有以下问题：
    （一）这个合同的签订，是把少数群众的要求当成了广大群众的要求，违背了大多数群众的意志。在靠山的四个村子，去年收成较好，但土地少而质量坏，群众虽有搞副业的要求，并有砍山的技术，但因砍架木利小，所以对砍木不积极（当时扛一根一丈二尺的檩条，可卖到十斤粮食，但扛一根七尺长的架木，只能赚到五斤粮食）。愿意砍的只有很少数为生活所迫的群众。平地群众灾荒严重，生活很苦，有生产救灾的要求，但没有砍山的技术，缺乏爬山的习惯，也不愿砍山林，因此合同本身是缺乏广泛的群众基础的。
    （二）对山林的情况了解的不够，又缺乏精确计算和周密计划。完成十万根架木的合同是有困难的。因为当时在前山上只能砍到五万根，其余的须到后山去砍，而后山路远难走，每次须经四十里大山，往返八十里。每人每天只能扛一根架木（七十斤）下山，赚到五斤粮食。根据山林情况和路程远近计算，十万根架木从山上连砍带装运，须八万个民力。以每根七十斤计算，共七百万斤，每个大车每次拉一千斤，共须七千车才能运完。全县总共只能动员四百辆车，每辆车运十七次，每次六天，共需一百零二天才能运完，即使是这样计算，但还没有把阴天下雪，人畜的休息时间等计算进去，而合同规定的期限却只是三个月。这说明了合同本身是与实际情况脱节的，因此造成了严重的强迫命令。
    如何执行呢？
    从去年十一月初到今年一月初，是执行合同的第一阶段。首先碰到的就是林权问题。前山因在一九四八年土改时，已有一部分分给了群众，后来虽曾一度计划收归国家所有，但因群众不满，并未正式收回。县委会为了履行合同，曾派县委去解决林权问题，确定除私有森林应坚决保护外，所分到公家的山林，已经私人出力修理者，由私人砍伐，其余可让群众砍伐。这样确定后，群众只砍了三万根。运下山者八千根，运到焦作煤矿者只五百根。两个月后到旧历年，又遇到天下大雪，路滑难走，工作就停止了。
    这时新乡专署曾发了个通报，批评济源县领导是“慢腾腾的官僚主义，领导不力，进行太慢”。接着平原日报也批评济源县领导机关“是严重的官僚主义，几十万斤小米，群众得不到，怨声载道”。这两方面的批评，更加促进了官僚主义和命令主义的发展（地委专署及报社在这次整风中都做了自我检讨——编者）。
    县委在受到批评以后态度怎样呢？
    第一、以官僚主义的态度接受批评。不考查有没有完成任务的条件，只认为这是“主观努力不够，干部领导不力”。第二、尤其在公开受到批评后，感到很丢人；历次的参军参战都完成了任务，因此盲目的认为工作有基础，群众有觉悟，十万根架木还能完不成？第三、认为已订了合同，煤矿等着用，如不完成，不只影响了信用，煤矿也要受到损失。
    由于这些思想存在，领导砍架木就采取了简单化的方法，对群众不是说服动员，而是强迫命令了。当时有的区干部向县委反映：群众普遍的提出利不大，加上到春耕时节了，都不愿去。但县领导上并未认真的来考虑这些意见，在作了些解释之后，即命令：“在一个月内完成七万根架木的任务；时间一天不能多，任务一根不能少，完不成由区长和区书负责。”县里的官僚主义态度（还有严重的强迫命令作风——编者）就促使区干部对群众采取了命令主义。区干部到村不到一周，就“动员”了两千余人上山。有的群众曾提出：“你们是生产救灾，还是任务？要是生产救灾，我们这里没灾；要是完成任务，我们没说的！共产党领导我们翻了身，可以去这一次。”区干部就答复道：“一半为救灾，一半为任务。”结果群众中很多是按劳力摊派的。有个富农，村里派他去，他出粮食雇了个人去，但被区干部打回来了。非叫本人亲自去不可。一般群众中也有愿意用米雇人去的。正月十五群众连春节也没得过，就被强迫上山去砍架木了。上山以后，又因缺乏组织和计划，即不管是公家的还是私人的；不管是果木树还是林木，捞着就砍。山上群众害怕被山下群众砍去了，也抢着砍。一时形成了严重的紊乱局面。两天以后，县里才派去干部制止了，但是乱子已经闯下了。这次共砍了架木四万根，连前次的共七万根。群众共得到粮食三十多万斤，因为其中有三分之一是不合规格的，伐来木头也换不到米。同时这次砍山林中，共砍了私人树木三千七百根，其中有果木树八十多根。有些山下群众到山上去，因房子少、缺水喝，又缺乏组织，所以违犯群众利益很严重。有吃了山上群众的棒子的，有吃了白面的。造成山上和山下群众的对立。同时群众对领导很不满意，有的说：“天天叫保护林木，现在又破坏林木。”有的说：“不是救灾，是要人命哩！公家作买卖，叫咱遭罪！”砍架木民工冰天雪地爬几十里大山，受冻受饿不算，还有的把脚砍了，有的冻出病了。
    济源在这次砍架木中表现了严重的官僚主义和命令主义：严重的违反了党的政策、路线，严重的损害了国家财产和群众利益，并使山上山下对立起来，影响了团结。
    为什么会造成以上的错误呢？
    根据济源县委、新乡地委和平原日报社的检讨和自我批评，有以下几个问题：一、思想方法上的主观片面性，不调查研究，凭道听途说，凭印象办事。二、缺乏群众观点，和老老实实为人民服务的态度。做工作喜欢轰轰烈烈，愿搞大的不愿搞小的。这样和广大群众利益密切相关的事情，不和群众商量，只少数人包办了事。对群众的意见，不认真地考虑、研究，一意孤行，结果严重的脱离了群众。三、严重的官僚主义作风，事先既没有调查研究和群众商量，受到批评之后又不冷静分析研究情况，而是“英雄”式的“限期完成”。四、地委和报纸的批评，本身也缺乏群众观点，只批评济源没有完成任务，并不考虑能否完成、如何完成，更没有派人去检查，因此更助长了错误。五、无计划无组织的盲目砍伐。六、有严重的无组织无纪律现象，县委借口联系不便，应向地委报告的没有报告，只是蒙着头干，到发生了问题才请示。
    最后，问题是怎样处理的呢？发现错误之后，领导上就立即下令停止，县长亲自向群众承认了错误，县领导干部并在人代会上进行了检讨。此外又拿出了五千四百多斤粮食，赔偿被砍了树木的群众。
