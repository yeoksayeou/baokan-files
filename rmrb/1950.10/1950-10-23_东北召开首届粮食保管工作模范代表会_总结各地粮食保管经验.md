　　Northeast Holds First Model Representative Conference on Grain Storage
　　Summarizes Grain Storage Experience from Various Regions

　　[This News] According to the Northeast Daily, the Northeast Grain Bureau convened the first Northeast Model Representative Conference on Grain Storage in late September, in order to summarize the grain storage experience of June, July, and August, and to reward the heroes in the grain storage work.

　　The cadres of the Northeast Grain Bureau system overcame the threat of summer heat and the difficulties of high grain moisture content and poor storage conditions this year, completing the arduous grain storage task assigned by the state, reducing the grain loss rate by 67% compared to last year.

　　At this conference, advanced experiences in grain storage work from various regions were fully exchanged. At the same time, the shortcomings in grain storage work were deeply reviewed, and methods for improving future work were proposed.

　　The biggest shortcoming in the grain storage work of the Northeast Grain Bureau system is that most grain workers, including general leading cadres, have a relatively serious supply system mentality. This is manifested in two different attitudes towards grain storage work. One attitude is "It doesn't matter how much money is spent as long as the grain is stored well"; the other attitude is "Waiting for disbursements." The former results in a great waste of grain storage costs; the latter prevents cadres from wholeheartedly delving into their work. In the final analysis, both seriously hinder the improvement and advancement of grain storage work. Some leading cadres rely solely on experience, distrust or even reject scientific and technological methods. The inspection and testing technicians equipped by the higher-level bureaus are left idle, and rationalization proposals put forward by the personnel below are instead met with blows. Therefore, righteousness cannot be promoted, the storage system is chaotic and lax, and the work suffers many unnecessary losses.

　　In view of the greater importance of future grain storage tasks, the conference determined that the following three tasks must be implemented in grain storage work: First, the supply system mentality among grain workers must be eradicated, and the economic accounting system must be implemented. Use minimal manpower and material resources to ensure that the stored grain does not mold or suffer losses. This work should start steadily from the main grain warehouses, gain experience, and then be promoted. Second, conservative ideas must be seriously criticized, and scientific and technological storage methods must be widely applied. To this end, it is necessary to improve the professional and technical level of cadres and train specialized storage cadres. Third, the warehouse storage system must be rectified, the democratic leadership style must be implemented, and the reward and punishment system must be clarified in order to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of all grain storage personnel and continuously improve grain storage work.

　　Before the closing of the conference, a grand award ceremony was held to reward dozens of heroes who had always stood at the forefront of the grain defense line in the past year.

　　东北召开首届粮食保管工作模范代表会
    总结各地粮食保管经验
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：为了总结六、七、八三个月粮食保管经验及奖励保管工作中的功臣，东北区粮食管理局于九月下旬，召开了东北首届粮食保管工作模范代表大会。
    东北区粮食管理局系统的干部，今年战胜了暑热的威胁，克服了粮食水份大、保管条件不好的困难，完成了国家所赋予的艰巨的粮食保管任务，使粮食损耗率较去年减低了百分之六十七。
    在这次大会上，充分地交流了各地粮食保管工作的先进经验，同时深刻地检讨了粮食保管工作中存在的缺点，提出了今后改进工作的办法。
    东北区粮食管理局系统的粮食保管工作中的最大缺点是：大部分粮食工作人员，包括一般领导干部在内，存在着比较严重的供给制思想，这表现在对待粮食保管工作两种不同的态度上面。一种态度是“只要把粮食保管好，花多少钱也没关系”；另一种态度是“等待支拨”。前者使粮食的保管费用浪费很大；后者使干部不能尽心的钻研业务。归根结底，都严重的阻碍着粮食保管工作的改进与提高。还有一些领导干部单纯凭借经验，不相信甚至是排斥科学技术方法，上级局给配备的检查化验技术人员空置不用，下边人员提出合理化建议反而遭到打击。因此，不能发扬正气，保管制度紊乱松懈，使工作受到很多不应有的损失。
    大会鉴于今后粮食保管任务更加重大了，因此，在粮食保管工作中，必须贯彻如下三项工作：首先必须根绝在粮食工作人员中供给制思想，贯彻经济核算制。用少许的人力与物力，使保管的粮食不霉烂不损失。这个工作先从主要的粮食仓库稳健做起，取得经验后再推广；其次，严肃批判保守思想，广泛应用科学技术保管方法。为此必须提高干部业务技术水平，培养专门保管干部；第三、整顿仓库保管制度，贯彻民主领导作风，严明赏罚制度。以期发挥全体粮食保管人员的积极性、创造性，不断改进粮食保管工作。
    大会闭幕前举行了隆重的发奖仪式，奖励一年来始终站在粮食保卫战线最前面的数十名功臣。
