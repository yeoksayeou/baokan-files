Crush Counter-Revolutionary Rumors
	Li Sha

	After the basic liberation of mainland China, although the openly armed enemies were eliminated, the hidden enemy agents, under the direction of the U.S.-Chiang clique, continued their sabotage activities. The ways in which the enemy carries out sabotage activities are various. And one of the main ways is to fabricate and spread rumors to disturb people's minds and disrupt the order of the country. According to investigations, rumors have been constantly found throughout the country. Since the U.S. imperialist aggression against Korea, rumors have become more rampant than before due to the intensified instigation by U.S. imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit gang.

	The content of the rumors can be roughly divided into three categories: The first category is related to current affairs, that is, advocating a third world war, exaggerating the power of U.S. imperialism, and blindly hyping up the power of atomic bombs to intimidate the masses. The second category is related to policies, deliberately distorting various policies of the People's Government, such as taxes, public bonds, disaster relief, production, marriage, and land reform, in order to undermine production, construction, and other work. The third category is to incite the relationship between the masses and cadres. Special agents often use some shortcomings in our work to incite some backward masses against government workers. Among the three types of rumors, those related to current affairs are the most numerous and have the widest range of circulation, and such rumors are mostly similar in various places. This shows that the enemy's rumor-mongering activities are planned and organized.

	These absurd rumors, when the masses' political level has not been universally improved and scientific knowledge is still very lacking, will have a certain impact. This adds many difficulties to our production and construction work and causes losses to the lives and property of the masses. For example, in Jinbei and Chahar South, bandits, special agents, and I-Kuan-Tao followers spread various rumors targeting the masses' thoughts, and dressed up as ghosts, wore sheepskins, and sold fake medicines. Many people were deceived, some died from taking fake medicines, women were raped, and crops were destroyed. Another example is that the people of Liujiang Village in Guangxi dared not sign the peace declaration because they were misled by rumors. After the rumors were broken, the peace signature campaign was widely launched. There are countless other similar examples.

	The people in the old liberated areas had experience in fighting against enemy rumors during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Self-Defense. However, after the transition from war to peaceful construction, some cadres gradually developed a sense of麻痹(paralysis), lost the necessary vigilance against hidden enemies, and adopted an attitude of letting rumors go without paying attention to them, even thinking that "they will collapse without being attacked" and "will not become a climate" after hearing rumors. They neither intervened nor investigated, which gave the enemy the convenience of freely spreading rumors. In addition, the education of the masses on current affairs and policies was not carried out adequately, which gave the enemy's rumor-mongering activities a gap and a market.

	If this situation is allowed to continue, it will cause significant harm to the country. Therefore, this situation must be resolutely corrected. At present, many regions have begun mass anti-rumor struggles and have achieved some results. This shows that as long as we are vigilant, resolutely fight against rumors, and strengthen the propaganda and education of current affairs and policies among the masses, the enemy's conspiracies can be completely crushed by us.

	In order to effectively combat the enemy's rumor-mongering activities, the following steps must be taken:

	1. In areas where rumors are prevalent, resolutely carry out the work of opposing rumors and eliminating rumors. Cadres and the broad masses must understand that in the people's democratic China, the enemy is not allowed to talk nonsense or act arbitrarily, rumors are completely illegal, and those who create rumors to confuse the public are enemies of the people. The rumor-mongers must be tracked down and brought to justice, and they must be sent to the government for legal action and made to confess to the masses so that the masses can understand the truth of the matter. For example, recently, Pinging County, Shanxi Province, mobilized more than 7,800 cadres, teachers, students, and doctors to carry out a county-wide rumor-clearing work in the anti-rumor struggle, using the specific facts of the masses being harmed by listening to special agent rumors to educate the masses, which had a great effect.

	2. In areas where rumors have been basically eliminated or where rumors have not yet become prevalent, propaganda and education on current affairs and policies and education on scientific knowledge should be carried out in a planned and regular manner to fundamentally improve the political and cultural level of cadres and the masses and block the gaps for the enemy to spread rumors: 1. First, cadres' understanding of current affairs and policies should be improved through regular study of current affairs and policies and political reports for a certain period of time, so that cadres at all levels can master the basic knowledge of the international situation and the main spirit of various policies. Make them often understand the current development of international issues, and through civil schools, winter schools, congresses, and various propaganda institutions and propaganda tools, the basic knowledge of current affairs and policies should be implemented to the masses. 2. Strengthen the current affairs propaganda work of local newspapers and radio stations. Newspapers and radio stations should further write manuscripts in a more popular way according to the needs of the broad cadres and masses, and systematically introduce some basic knowledge of current affairs, policies, and science. A large number of reading groups should be organized and developed, and the role of radio operators should be strengthened.

	3. Unify the propaganda forces and establish a propaganda team that can be commanded at all levels from top to bottom, that is, establish a propaganda network from top to bottom and develop propagandists. Many regions are trying to do this. To establish a propaganda network, first of all, the various propaganda organizations of the Party, government, army, people, and Youth League should be improved so that they can truly play a role instead of being just a formality. Various propaganda organizations at the same level should establish a joint propaganda meeting under the leadership of the Party to regularly study the situation and formulate propaganda plans and methods according to the situation. First, the backbone members of each propaganda group can be selected to form a propaganda team. In this way, it is easier to achieve results by carrying out propaganda work to the masses in a planned way from top to bottom with leadership and a core. Local newspapers and radio stations should undertake the task of supplying propaganda materials to propaganda organizations at all levels and should constantly introduce propaganda methods and exchange experiences, so that the unified and coordinated work efficiency of various propaganda organizations and propaganda tools can be brought into play.

	The dying enemy will never automatically give up its sabotage activities. This requires us to work hard to eliminate him in all aspects. As long as we are vigilant and actively launch a struggle on the propaganda front, the enemy's rumor-mongering conspiracy will definitely be crushed. All Party members, government officials, soldiers, and civilians should mobilize all forces to fight to eliminate hidden enemy agents and must not allow these despicable and shameless counter-revolutionaries to run rampant in our country.

### 粉碎反革命谣言

　　粉碎反革命谣言
    黎砂
    在中国大陆基本上解放以后，公开持枪的敌人虽被消灭，暗藏隐蔽的敌特在美蒋指使下仍在继续其破坏活动。敌人进行破坏活动的方式是各种各样的。而其中主要的方式之一，就是捏造和散放谣言，以扰乱人心，破坏国家的秩序。据调查，全国各地都曾不断发现谣言。在美帝国主义侵略朝鲜以后，由于美帝国主义和国民党匪帮的加紧策动，谣言更较前猖獗。
    谣言内容，大致可分三类：第一类是属于时事性的，即鼓吹三次大战，夸大美帝国主义的力量，瞎吹原子弹厉害，以恐吓群众。第二类是属于政策性的，对人民政府的税收、公债、救灾、生产、婚姻、土改等项政策，故意作各种歪曲，以破坏生产建设和其他工作。第三类属于挑拨群众和干部关系的。特务分子们常常利用我们工作中某些缺点，挑动一部分落后群众反对政府工作人员。三类谣言以时事性的为最多，流传范围亦较广，各地此类谣言亦多雷同。这说明敌特的散谣活动是有计划和有组织地进行的。
    这些荒谬谣言，在群众政治水平尚未普遍提高，科学知识还极缺乏的情况下，是会有一定影响的。这就给我们的生产建设工作增加了许多困难，并使群众生命财产遭受损失。如晋北、察南，匪特、一贯道徒针对群众思想，散布各种谣言，并装神扮鬼，披羊皮、卖假药，群众受骗不少，有吃假药死的，妇女被奸污的，庄稼遭破坏的。又如广西柳江村人民因受谣言蒙蔽不敢在和平宣言上签名，以后把谣言打破后，和平签名运动才广泛展开。其他类似的例子不胜枚举。
    老解放区的人民在抗日战争和自卫战争期中，曾有过与敌特谣言作斗争的经验。但由战争转入和平建设后，一些干部逐渐产生了麻痹思想，对隐蔽敌人失去应有的警惕，对敌特造谣亦采取听之任之，不加理睬的态度，甚至听到谣言后，还认为“不攻自破”，“成不了什么气候”，既不过问，也不追究，这就给了敌人以自由散布谣言的便利。再加上对群众的时事政策教育进行得很不够，更给敌人的造谣活动以空隙，给谣言以市场。
    这种情况如任其继续下去，其结果将会造成对国家的重大危害。所以必须坚决纠正这种情况。目前许多地区已经开始了群众性的反谣斗争，而且取得了一些成绩，这说明只要我们一经警惕，坚决与谣言作斗争，并在群众中加强时事政策的宣传教育，敌人的阴谋鬼计是完全可以被我们粉碎的。
    为了有效地打击敌特的造谣活动，必须采取下列一些步骤：
    一、在谣言流行的地区，坚决进行反对谣言和肃清谣言的工作。要使干部与广大群众懂得，在人民民主的中国，决不许敌人乱说乱动，谣言是完全非法的，造谣惑众的人便是人民的敌人。对造谣者一定要跟踪追查，追出造谣的人来，把他送政府法办，并使他向群众坦白，使群众了解事情的真相。例如最近山西平定县在反谣斗争中动员了全县干部、教员、学生、医生等七千八百余人开展全县规模的肃谣工作，用群众因听信特务谣言受害的具体事实来教育群众，作用很大。
    二、在谣言已经基本上消灭或谣言尚未流行地区则应有计划地、经常地进行时事政策的宣传教育和科学知识的教育，从根本上提高干部和群众的政治、文化水平，堵塞敌人造谣的空隙：１、首先通过经常的干部时事政策学习和一定时期的政治报告提高干部对时事和政策的认识，使各级干部能够掌握国际形势的基本知识和各种政策的主要精神。使他们经常懂得目前国际问题的发展情况，并通过民校、冬学、代表会以及各种宣传机构和宣传工具把时事政策的基本知识贯彻到群众中去。２、加强地方报纸和广播台的时事宣传工作。报纸和广播台应进一步根据广大干部和群众需要把稿件写得更通俗些，并系统的介绍一些时事、政策、科学的基本知识。大量组织和发展读报组，加强收音员的作用。
    三、统一宣传力量，由上而下建立能按级指挥的宣传队伍，即建立起由上而下的宣传网和发展宣传员。有许多地区正在试办。建立宣传网首先应把党、政、军、民、青年团的各种宣传组织健全起来，使他们真正能起作用而不是虚设。同级各种宣传组织应在党的领导下建立合一的宣传会议，经常研究情况，并根据情况拟制宣传计划和办法。最先可以选择各宣传团体中的骨干分子，组织宣传员组，这样从上到下有领导、有核心、有计划地对群众展开宣传工作，就易收到效果。地方报纸和广播台应担负起供给各级宣传组织以宣传材料的任务，并应不断介绍宣传方法，交流经验，这样便可以发挥各宣传组织和宣传工具的统一配合的工作效能。
    垂死的敌人绝不肯自动放弃其破坏活动。这就需要我们努力从各方面来消灭他，只要我们提高警惕、主动积极展开宣传战线上的斗争，敌人的造谣阴谋是一定会被粉碎的。全体党、政、军、民应当动员一切力量为消灭暗藏的敌特而斗争，绝不能再让这些卑鄙无耻的反革命分子在我们国家内部任意横行。
