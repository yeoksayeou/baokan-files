　　Cultural Palace Post Office Service Station
　　Changes Office Hours
　　Now that the weather is getting shorter and cooler, and there are fewer visitors to the Labor People's Cultural Palace in the morning and evening, in order to adapt to the current situation, the office hours of the Cultural Palace Post and Telecommunications Service Station will be changed from October onwards. On weekdays, the hours will be from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 6:30 PM. On Sundays and holidays, the hours will be extended by one hour, from 8:30 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM.
　　In addition, the Beijing Postal Administration and the postal branches in Beijing will be completely closed to the public on National Day. On the 2nd and 3rd, all departments will be open to the public as usual on Sundays.

　　文化宫邮局服务站
    变更办公时间
    现因天气渐短渐凉，劳动人民文化宫早晚游人稀少，为适应目前情况，文化宫邮电服务站办公时间，自十月份起，平常日改为上午九时至十二时，下午二时至六时半；星期及例假日延长一小时，上午八时半至十二时，下午二时至七时。
    又，北京邮政管理局及京市各邮政支局在国庆节对外营业完全停止，二、三两日各部门照星期例对外营业。
