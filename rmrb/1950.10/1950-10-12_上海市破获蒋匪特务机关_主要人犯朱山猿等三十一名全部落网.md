Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th -- The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau recently cracked a case involving the "Shanghai Special Group" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agent organization "Ministry of National Defense Security Bureau" dispatched to Shanghai. A total of 31 criminals were captured, including the main culprit Zhu Shanyuan, the pseudo "Shanghai Special Group" colonel leader and one of the Kuomintang's notorious thugs, as well as key offenders Zhao Ziqiang, Zhang Hongchang, Jiang Yongxi, and Xue Zhongying. A large amount of incriminating evidence such as pistols, ammunition, and reactionary leaflets were seized. These bandits were wiped out by our city's Public Security Bureau within a week of their arrival in Shanghai.

It is reported that bandit Zhu Shanyuan graduated from the Chiang bandit Kuomintang’s Linli Special Training Class. Since 1938, he has served as the group leader of the bandit Kuomintang’s "Shanghai District Action Group" and the deputy captain of the "Hong Kong-Shanghai Action Team." In September of last year, he was appointed by bandit chief Mao Renfeng as the colonel leader of the "Security Bureau Shanghai Special Group," tasking him with making arrangements to hide in the liberated areas and assassinate revolutionary cadres and democrats. He was initially given activity funds equivalent to 17 taels of gold in Taiwanese currency, two revolvers, and three Mauser pistols, with a deadline of three months to complete his pseudo-mission. After receiving the order, bandit Zhu rushed between Taiwan and Dinghai to conspire and make arrangements, co-opting bandit cadres, and began to organize five action groups in Shanghai's Pudong, Zhabei, Central, West Shanghai, and South Shanghai, as well as intelligence, transportation, and propaganda sections. The bandit "National Defense Ministry Technical Corps" in Dinghai allocated five American-style grenades, three detonators, three timed firing pins, and a stick of American-made yellow explosives. In January of this year, bandit Zhu sent criminal Zhao Ziqiang and others in the name of the bandit "National Defense Ministry Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) Action Headquarters" to infiltrate Shanghai in advance, lie dormant, and instigate the formation of five bandit command headquarters of armed organizations in Jinghu-Hangzhou, Jinghu line, and along the Yangtze River. After a long period of conspiracy and planning, and with arrangements in place, bandit Zhu then led bandits such as Zhang Hongchang to infiltrate Shanghai. After infiltrating Shanghai, bandit Zhu and his cohorts actively arranged so-called "working routes" and contact points, and cover organizations, purchased poisons such as potassium cyanide, and attempted to manufacture poisons and explosives in order to carry out conspiracies and assassinations. They also incited bandit agents to gather military intelligence, print and distribute reactionary leaflets, and forge People's Bank of China wrappers for RMB, packaging them as banknotes with missing amounts, undermining the reputation of our People's Bank of China and disrupting our finances. After the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau verified the bandit's conspiratorial activities through investigation, it arrested all of bandit Zhu and his cohorts within a week.

    【新华社上海十一日电】上海市人民政府公安局，最近破获蒋匪特务机关“国防部保密局”派沪“上海特别组”特务案一起。计捕获主犯伪“上海特别组”上校组长、军统著名打手之一朱山猿及要犯赵自强、张洪昌、蒋永锡、薛忠瑛等三十一名全部人犯；并搜出手枪、弹药及反动传单等罪证甚多。该匪等系于抵沪后一星期内，为我市公安局一举扑灭。
    按朱匪山猿，系蒋匪军统临澧特训班出身。自一九三八年后，历任匪军统“上海区行动组”小组长，“港沪行动队”副队长等职。去年九月，由匪首毛人凤委为“保密局上海特别组”上校组长伪职，令其专事布置、潜伏解放区，暗杀革命干部及民主人士，一次发给活动经费台币折合黄金十七两、左轮枪两支、马牌枪三支，限期三个月完成伪命。朱匪受命后，即奔走台湾、定海间阴谋布置，笼络匪干，着手筹组上海浦东、闸北、中心、沪西及沪南等五个行动小组，及情报、交通、宣传等股。由定海匪“国防部技术总队”复拨予美式手榴弹五颗、雷管三支、定时击针三支、美制黄色炸药一条。今年一月，朱匪首遣赵犯自强等以匪“国防部京沪行动总队”名义，先行潜入上海，隐伏活动，并唆使筹组京沪杭、京沪沿线、长江两岸等五个匪指挥部之武装组织。朱匪经长期诡谋策划，布置就绪后，遂率匪徒张洪昌等潜入上海。朱匪等潜入上海后，即积极布置所谓“工作路线”及联络密点与掩护机关，购置氰化钾等毒物，妄图自制毒药、炸药，以便从事阴谋暗害；复唆使匪特刺探军情，印发反动传单，并伪造人民银行包扎人民币的封签，装成缺额钞票，破坏我人民银行信誉，扰乱我金融。上海市人民政府公安局对该匪等阴谋活动情况，经侦查属实后，遂于一周内将朱匪等全部缉拿归案。
