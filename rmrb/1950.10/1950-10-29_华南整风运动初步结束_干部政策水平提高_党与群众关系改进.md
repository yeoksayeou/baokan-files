　　The Initial Conclusion of the Rectification Movement in South China
    Cadre Policy Understanding Improved, Relationship Between the Party and the Masses Improved
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] According to the Wuhan Changjiang Daily news: The rectification movement of the Party at all levels under the leadership of the South China Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has largely completed the stage of initial inspection and summarization.

    The main gains from the rectification study in the past few months are: the understanding of policies by cadres at all levels has been improved. For example, comrades at the district level and below in the Pearl River District reflected: "It is like waking up from a dream. In the past, we relied on coercion to complete tasks, but now we know that we must talk about policies." Because their understanding of policies has improved, they can correctly implement policies in their work, and their work style has also improved. After preliminary rectification and study, cadres at the county and district levels in the North River District have generally improved their work. The masses reflected on Xia Zhengzhong of Qujiang County, saying: "The comrades who worked last year were not like the ones now. Last year, during the autumn levy, they did not approach us. They assessed the amount themselves. This year, they are all doing things according to the policies." Cadres in various counties in South Road were also able to correctly implement the policy of reasonable burden during the summer levy and calculate the burden amount according to regulations. The peasants were very satisfied with this summer levy, and the landlords had nothing to say. All classes also showed stability.

    The second gain is that the bureaucratic and commandist style of cadres at all levels has begun to change after exposure and criticism, and the relationship between the Party and the masses has been significantly improved. Chen Jiangtian, the head of Panyu County in the Pearl River District, and a female comrade working in women's affairs, sincerely made self-criticisms of the shortcomings in the autumn levy work last year at the Farmers' Congress and the Women's Congress. The delegates present were greatly moved and rushed to the congress to review how they had concealed farmland and delayed the delivery of public grain in the past, and promised to complete the grain levy task upon their return. Cadres in Shixing County in the North River District reviewed the mistakes in the autumn levy work last year to the masses at the Farmers' Congress. The masses were moved and followed suit to conduct reviews. Under the leadership of a farmers' association chairman, the masses reported hundreds of acres of uncultivated land on the spot. In Datang District, Qujiang County, due to the cadres' reliance on the masses to repeatedly investigate and squeeze out [concealed land], the amount of farmland found was three times more than during the autumn levy last year. The masses in Panyu and Dongguan counties in the Pearl River District have realized that "the Communist Party's rectification is good," so when they encounter our work teams, they ask: "Have you undergone rectification?"

    The third gain of the rectification study is: it has promoted inner-Party democracy, conducted criticism and self-criticism, improved the relationship between superiors and subordinates, and strengthened inner-Party unity.

    Reasons for the success of the rectification: fully promote democracy, unfold criticism and self-criticism, deeply collect materials, and grasp the correct method of rectification.

    In the past, the South China Party was in an environment of underground work and guerrilla warfare for a long time, and there was less exercise in inner-Party democratic life. However, in the rectification study in the past few months, the party organizations at all levels have generally been able to promote democracy and carry forward the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. Leading cadres also called on comrades to "know everything and say everything"; to ensure that "the speaker is not guilty, and the listener should take warning"; to express "if there is something to correct, correct it; if there is nothing, encourage it." Many leading cadres conducted work summaries and reviews in a spirit of full self-criticism, dispelling the concerns of comrades, inspiring everyone to criticize leaders and conduct self-criticism and mutual criticism. Wu Youheng, secretary of the Yuezhong Prefectural Committee, made a practical review of his shortcomings at the rectification meeting convened by the Prefectural Committee. He deeply analyzed the roots of his thoughts from the work inspection in connection with his origin and work history, and exposed his thoughts without any personal concerns, fully promoting the spirit of self-criticism. This played a great role in improving the leadership of the Yuezhong Prefectural Committee, strengthening unity and promoting inner-Party democracy. Due to the promotion of the spirit of democracy and criticism and self-criticism, although the party organizations at all levels in South China lacked experience in rectification, they also achieved certain achievements.

    In addition to the above reasons, the reason why this rectification achieved certain achievements is also due to mastering the correct rectification method: First, before carrying out the rectification, the leading side went deep into the lower levels to collect rich materials, and then put them forward in the rectification meeting to carry out in-depth inspection work with emphasis. For example, the Xijiang Prefectural Committee went to the countryside to specifically inspect the work before the rectification, understand the situation, and master a considerable amount of practical materials. In particular, it has mastered more and fuller materials on Luoding County. Therefore, at the rectification meeting convened by the Prefectural Committee, it focused on Luoding County for in-depth inspection to promote the rectification of other counties. Second, master the inspection work methods of top-down and bottom-up, leadership and mass combination. For example, the Shantou Municipal Party Committee used several inspection work methods - mainly because the leadership enlightened the party member cadres of the municipal party committee and government to conduct key inspection work, from the inspection of several major events since liberation to inspect the leadership of the municipal party committee and government and further link it to the work of the unit; various organs convened relevant mass organizations symposiums, etc., to extensively and comprehensively collect the masses' opinions on the work of the organ; and from the inspection of the work of the general staff of lower-level organs to the inspection of the leadership of the organ, etc. Third, the direct leadership of the party committees at all levels over the rectification and study of their subordinate units (such as the standing committee members of the prefectural committee directly going to the county to lead the rectification study of the county, etc.) is also an important method to make the rectification effective.

    Shortcomings in rectification study

    In the rectification study in the past few months, there were also some shortcomings and deviations: First, some units lacked a clear understanding of the basic spirit of the purpose of rectification in the early stage of rectification, which is to improve work. Therefore, they failed to fully grasp the method of focusing on summarizing and inspecting work in the rectification, but focused on inspecting individuals, settling old scores, and settling trivial issues; individual cadres took the opportunity to complain and vent their personal grievances; some people pushed all mistakes to the leading organs, and there was a deviation of extreme democracy. When reading documents, some units only read documents related to bureaucracy, and did not stipulate the reading of documents related to inspection and summary of work. In particular, they did not read Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session well. The summary reports of the responsible comrades of some units were not prepared thoroughly and adequately, and only generally pointed out the advantages and disadvantages of the work and the style of leadership, etc., and failed to deeply inspect the ideological situation of the leading cadres at all levels from the situation of implementing the guidelines and policies, and use it to enlighten the cadres. The larger deviation is that there is little talk about achievements and advantages, only rectification of errors and shortcomings, more reviews of bad examples, and fewer commendations of good examples. For example, some prefectural committees put forward "find more shortcomings and talk less about advantages" during the rectification, so they could not grasp the overall inspection during the rectification, forming a special inspection of shortcomings and errors, and focusing on reviewing past work. Very little or no mention was made of the improvement of future work, so after the rectification, some comrades had a feeling of being tied up, afraid of making mistakes, and not daring to take responsibility for their work. Second, some units were tight at first and then loose in the rectification, starting off strong but fizzling out, and wanted to end it sloppily in the end. In particular, they are not good at combining rectification study with various work meetings, and do not understand that rectification can be carried out through various work meetings. Some cadres even said that they were busy with various work meetings and had no time for rectification. The reason for this deviation is that they did not combine rectification study with work, but isolated rectification for implementation. Third, individual prefectural committees failed to grasp the central and South China sub-bureau's "top-down" rectification instructions. Often, before the above was rectified, a comprehensive rectification was carried out; or focusing on personal reflection, the result was not grasping the center, and carrying out a large-scale rectification movement in a fragmented handicraft style. Some areas did not focus on checking work and used their strength evenly. For example, they had to check on everything such as bandit suppression, anti-hegemony, grain requisition, production to overcome famine, and disaster relief, instead of focusing on checking the main problems in the main work, to solve other secondary work problems in conjunction. Therefore, it failed to achieve the true solution of ideological problems and practical problems.

    The above shortcomings and deviations have been instructed by the South China Sub-bureau to the party organizations at all levels to strive to overcome, in order to achieve greater results in the future rectification.

　　华南整风运动初步结束
    干部政策水平提高  党与群众关系改进
    【本报讯】据武汉长江日报消息：中共中央华南分局领导下的各级党的整风运动，大体上已经完成初步检查总结工作的阶段。
    这几个月来整风学习的主要的收获是：把各级干部对政策的认识提高了一步。如珠江区区级以下的同志反映说：“如大梦初醒，以前靠强迫命令去完成任务，现在才知道要讲政策。”由于他们对政策的认识提高了，所以在工作中能够正确地执行政策，而且工作作风也有所改进。北江区县区级干部经过初步整风学习，工作一般都有了改进。曲江县夏征中，群众反映说：“去年工作同志不比现在的，去年秋征就没有接近我们，要多少就由他们自己评，今年都照政策办事了。”南路各县干部在夏征中也都能正确执行合理负担政策，按照条例计算负担额。农民对这次夏征感到很满意，地主也无话可说，各阶层也都表现得很安定。
    其次的收获是：各级干部的官僚主义命令主义作风，经过揭露批判，已经开始转变，党与群众的关系有了显著改进。珠江区番禺县长陈江天和一个妇女工作同志，在农代会、妇代会上，诚恳地对去年秋征工作中的缺点进行自我批评。到会代表大受感动，争先向大会检讨自己过去如何瞒田拖交公粮，并保证回去完成征粮任务。北江始兴县的干部在农代会上向群众检讨了去年秋征工作中的错误，群众受了感动，也跟着进行检讨。在一个农会长的带头检讨下，群众当场报出了几百亩黑地来。在曲江县大塘区，由于干部依靠群众反复查挤，查出的田亩比去年秋征时多了三倍。珠江区的番禺、东莞等县的群众都认识了“共产党的整风是好的”，所以碰到我们的工作队就问：“你们有没有经过整风？”
    整风学习的第三个收获是：发扬了党内民主，进行了批评与自我批评，改善了上下级的关系，加强了党内团结。
    整风获得成绩的原因：充分发扬民主展开批评与自我批评深入搜
    集材料掌握正确的整风方法
    华南党过去长期处在地下工作与游击战争的环境中，党内民主生活锻炼较少。但在这几个月的整风学习中，各级党的组织一般都能够发扬民主，发扬批评与自我批评的精神。领导干部并号召同志们“知无不言，言无不尽”；保证“言者无罪，闻者足戒”；表示“有则改之，无则加勉”。好多领导干部以充分的自我批评的精神来进行工作总结及检讨，打消同志们的顾虑，启发大家批评领导并进行自我批评、相互批评。粤中地委书记吴有恒在地委召集的整风会议上，对自己的缺点作了切实的检讨，从工作检查中联系到自己的出身和工作历史来深入分析自己的思想根源，毫无个人顾虑的暴露自己的思想，充分发扬了自我批评的精神。这对粤中地委的改善领导，加强团结和发扬党内民主起了很大的推动作用。由于民主精神与批评自我批评的发扬，所以华南各级党的组织虽然缺乏整风经验，但也获得了一定的成就。
    这次整风之所以获得一定的成就，除上述原因以外，还由于掌握了正确的整风方法：一、在进行整风之前，先由领导方面深入下层，搜集了丰富的材料，然后在整风会议中提出，进行有重点的深入检查工作，如西江地委在整风前下乡具体检查工作，了解情况，掌握了相当充分的实际材料。特别是对罗定县的材料掌握得较多较充分，因此在地委召开的整风会议上，就以罗定县为重点进行深入的检查，以推动其他各县的整风。二、掌握自上而下和自下而上，领导与群众结合的检查工作方法。如汕头市委运用了几种检查工作的方法——主要是由于领导上启发市委市府所属机关的党员干部进行重点的检查工作，从检查解放以来几件大事来检查市委市府的领导并进一步联系本单位的工作；各机关召开有关的群众团体座谈会等，广泛地全面地搜集群众对该机关工作的意见；以及从检查下级机关一般工作人员的工作联系到检查该机关的领导等。三、各级党委直接领导所属单位的整风学习（如地委的常委直接到县去领导县的整风学习等）也是使整风得到收效的重要方法。
    整风学习中存在的缺点
    在这几个月的整风学习中，也存在一些缺点和偏向：一、在整风初期有些单位对整风的目的，在于改进工作这一基本精神缺乏明确的认识。因此，在整风中未能充分掌握以总结检查工作为主的方法，而着重去检查个人，清算旧账，清算枝节问题；有个别干部乘机发牢骚，泄私愤；有些人把什么错误都推到领导机关去，发生了极端民主的偏向。在阅读文件中有些单位只读有关官僚主义的文件，没有规定阅读与检查总结工作有关的文件。特别是没有好好的阅读毛主席在三中全会的报告。有些单位的负责同志的总结报告准备得不周密不充分，只一般地指出工作中的优缺点和领导作风等，未能深入的从执行方针政策的情形来检查各级领导干部的思想情况，并用以启发干部。而较大的偏向是少谈成绩优点，专整错误缺点，检讨坏典型多，表扬好典型少。如有些地委在整风时，就提出“多找缺点，少讲优点”，因而在整风中不能掌握全面的检查，形成专门检查缺点错误，并且着重检讨过去的工作。对今后工作的改进却提得很少或者没有提到，以致整风后，在部分同志中产生了束手束脚，怕犯错误，不敢负责工作的现象。二、有些单位在整风中先紧后松，虎头蛇尾，拖到后来就想马马虎虎的结束。特别是不善于把整风学习与各种工作会议结合，不了解可以通过各种工作会议来进行整风。有些干部甚至说忙于开各种工作会议，没有时间进行整风。产生这种偏向的原因是没有把整风学习与工作结合，而把整风孤立起来进行。三、个别地委未能掌握住中央及华南分局“自上而下”的整风指示。常常上面未整好，即进行全面的整顿；或者着重个人反省，结果抓不住中心，把一个大规模的整风运动，以零零碎碎的手工业式方法来进行。有些地区在检查工作时没有重点，平均使用力量。如对剿匪、反霸、征粮、生产度荒、救灾等工作，样样都要检查，而不是有重点地检查主要工作中的主要问题，以联带解决其他次要工作的问题。因而未能达到真正解决思想问题和实际问题。
    以上缺点偏向已由华南分局指示各级党组织努力克服，以期在今后整风中获得更大的成绩。
