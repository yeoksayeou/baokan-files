　　Why Did U.S. Imperialism Usurp the Name of the United Nations to Invade Korea?
　　——Answering Questions from Ben Hong, Zhao Dezhen, and Others
　　Comrades Ben Hong, Zhao Dezhen, and others:

　　For the sake of ease in answering, we have summarized your many questions regarding the Korean war situation into two questions: (1) Why did U.S. imperialism usurp the name of the United Nations to invade Korea? (2) What are the prospects for the development of the Korean war situation?

　　Regarding the first question, it is first necessary to understand that the fundamental purpose of the war launched by U.S. imperialism and its puppet Syngman Rhee more than three months ago was to destroy the brilliant achievements of peaceful construction in the northern part of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, to destroy the peaceful fortress that hinders the war of aggression, to make North Korea a colony of U.S. imperialism like the South, and to make the entire Korea a base for the U.S. to expand its war of aggression in the East. They overestimated the "strength" of the Syngman Rhee puppet army, which was trained and equipped by the U.S. and directly controlled by American officers, and underestimated the strength of the heroic Korean people, thinking that the Syngman Rhee puppet army could easily occupy all of North Korea "like taking a walk" in a few days. However, the Syngman Rhee puppet army was badly battered by the counter-attacking iron fist of the Korean People's Army and retreated in a panic from the very beginning. This threw the American warmongers into a flurry, and they transferred their naval, land, and air forces that they could mobilize to Korea for direct combat. In order to conceal their naked aggression from the people at home and abroad, the U.S. used its "majority" voting machine to usurp the name of the "United Nations" and collected cannon fodder from various vassal states to cobble together the so-called "United Nations forces." Thus, all crimes, such as armed intervention in the Korean civil war, indiscriminate bombing of peaceful Korean cities and villages, and the massacre of peaceful Korean residents, were committed under the guise of the United Nations. In this way, the U.S. attempted to wrap its criminal bloody hands with the stolen flag of the United Nations in order to deceive the eyes of the world. However, everyone knows that the Charter of the United Nations opposes aggression and maintains international peace and security. The people of the world will never tolerate U.S. imperialism using the name of the United Nations to commit acts of aggression that violate this charter. The above-mentioned crimes of the U.S. are a great insult to the Charter of the United Nations! All the sophistry and quibbles, all "proposals," and all "resolutions" passed by the "majority" of the U.S. and its vassal states cannot conceal the iron-clad fact: the "United Nations forces" that are currently invading Korea and continuously expanding the war of aggression are the invading forces of the U.S.-led aggressive bloc, – forces that tear up the UN Charter and destroy the UN organization.

　　So, under these circumstances, what are the prospects for the development of the Korean war situation?

　　At the current session of the United Nations General Assembly, U.S. imperialism once again used its "majority" voting machine to reject the Soviet proposal for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue and passed the so-called "Eight-Nation Proposal" instigated by the U.S., which encourages the invading forces to expand the war of aggression. This shows that U.S. imperialism is determined to expand the war of aggression in Korea at all costs, attempting to achieve its predetermined goal that it has failed to achieve in the past three months: to enslave all the Korean people with figures like Syngman Rhee as overseers, and to use Korea as a military base to continue expanding the war of aggression. The people of China and the world must be seriously vigilant against the U.S.'s sinister plot to expand the war of aggression. The ambition of U.S. imperialism is to destroy the free and democratic lives of the hundreds of millions of people around the world who have already been liberated, to eliminate their anti-aggression forces, and to suppress the burgeoning liberation struggles of oppressed nations and oppressed people, in order to consolidate the tottering bloody rule of imperialism and its puppets. However, this arrogant conspiracy of the U.S. will inevitably accelerate its own demise. More than thirty years ago, the Soviet Union, just born out of the flames of civil war, crushed the joint attack of fourteen imperialist countries. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, from scratch and from small to large, overthrew the dynasty of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which was fully supported by the U.S. in military, economic, and political aspects. And the young Democratic People's Republic of Korea has also severely hit the arrogance of U.S. aggression, making the invading forces generally suffer from "shock disease." The invincibility of the people's power has been proven by countless historical facts.

　　Judging from the current situation, the Korean people's resistance war will be long-term and arduous, but it will inevitably make the American invading army sink deeper and deeper into the mire and be unable to extricate itself until the Korean people achieve final victory. As long as we review the struggle and victory of the Russian October Revolution, the war and victory of the Soviet people against the once powerful Hitler bandit gang, and the struggle and victory of the Chinese people in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, we have enough experience to prove the above conclusion.

### 美帝国主义为什么要盗用联合国名义来侵略朝鲜？——答奔轰、赵德贞等问

　　美帝国主义为什么要盗用联合国名义来侵略朝鲜？
    ——答奔轰、赵德贞等问奔轰、赵德贞等同志：
    为便于答复起见，我们把你们所提关于朝鲜战局的许多问题归纳成两个问题：（一）美帝国主义为何要盗用联合国名义来侵略朝鲜？（二）朝鲜战局的发展前途如何？
    关于第一个问题，首先必须了解：美帝国主义及傀儡李承晚于三个多月前发动战争的基本目的，就是要摧毁朝鲜民主主义人民共和国北部和平建设的辉煌成绩，摧毁阻碍侵略战争的和平堡垒，使朝鲜北部像南部一样沦为美帝国主义的殖民地，使整个朝鲜成为美帝扩大东方侵略战争的基地。他们事前过高估计了由美帝一手训练和装备起来的、由美国军官直接控制的李承晚伪军的“实力”，而低估了英勇的朝鲜人民的力量，以为李承晚伪军能在几天内“像散步一样”轻易地占领全部北朝鲜。可是李承晚伪军一开始便在朝鲜人民军反击的铁拳上碰得头破血流，狼狈败退。这使美国战争贩子们手忙脚乱，抽调其现在能够抽调的海陆空军到朝鲜直接作战了。为要向国内外人民掩盖其赤裸裸的侵略罪行，美帝就利用其“多数”表决机，盗用了“联合国”的名义，并向各仆从国家搜集炮灰，拚凑成所谓“联合国军队”。于是武装干涉朝鲜内战、滥炸朝鲜和平城市和乡村、屠杀朝鲜和平居民等等一切罪行都假借了联合国的名义了。美帝就这样企图用被盗窃来的联合国旗帜把自己罪恶的血手包裹起来，以欺蒙世人的眼睛。然而谁都知道：联合国的宪章是反对侵略，维持国际和平和安全的，世界人民决不能容忍美帝国主义假借联合国名义进行违反这个宪章的侵略罪行，美帝的上述罪行是对联合国宪章的莫大侮辱！美帝及其仆从国家的一切狡辞强辩，一切“提案”和一切由“多数”通过的“决议”，都不能掩饰铁一般的事实：目前正在侵略朝鲜而且不断扩大侵略战争的“联合国军队”，乃是以美帝为首的侵略集团的侵略军队，——撕毁联合国宪章、破坏联合国组织的军队。
    那么在此种情况之下，朝鲜战局的发展前途又如何呢？
    美帝国主义在本届联合国大会上居然又运用其“多数”表决机器否决了苏联和平解决朝鲜问题的提案，而通过了由美帝主使的，鼓励侵略军扩大侵略战争的所谓“八国提案”。这说明了美帝国主义决心不顾一切地扩大侵朝战争，妄图达到其三个多月来没有达到的预定目的：以李承晚一流的脚色为总管而奴役全朝鲜人民，并以朝鲜为军事基地继续扩大侵略战争。全中国全世界人民必须严重警惕美帝扩大侵略战争的罪恶阴谋。美帝国主义的野心是要摧毁全世界已获解放的亿万人民的自由民主的生活，消灭他们的反侵略力量，镇压正在蓬勃发展的被压迫民族和被压迫人民的解放斗争，借以稳固摇摇欲倒的帝国主义及其傀儡们的血腥统治。然而美帝这种狂妄的阴谋必然要加速自己的灭亡。三十余年前，刚从内战的炮火中诞生下来的苏联粉碎了十四个帝国主义国家的联合进攻。从无到有，从小到大的中国人民解放军推翻了由美帝在军事、经济、政治各方面全力支持的蒋介石匪帮的王朝。而年轻的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国也重重打击了美帝的侵略气焰，使侵略军普遍患了“吃惊病”。人民力量之不能被战胜，这是无数历史事实所已经证明的了。
    从目前的情势看来，朝鲜人民的抗战是长期的，艰苦的，但必然要使美国侵略军的泥腿越陷越深，而不能自拔，直到朝鲜人民取得最后的胜利。我们只要温习一下俄国十月革命的斗争和胜利，苏联人民对叱咤一时的希特勒匪帮的战争和胜利，以及中国人民在抗日战争和解放战争中的战斗和胜利，我们就有足够经验可以证明上述的论断。
