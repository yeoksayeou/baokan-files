[Report from our newspaper in Taiyuan] The innovation record movement in various public factories and mines in Shanxi has now been fully launched. By the end of August, more than 40 major public factories and mines had joined the movement, resulting in a large number of inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals, creating a great deal of wealth for the country. According to statistics, in the 11 provincial-run factories and mines in Taiyuan, 15 new records were created in June for improving quality, reducing waste, eliminating accidents, and saving raw materials. By July, the number of new records had increased to 52. The Industrial Chemical Company created 52 new records from March to late September, creating a total value of approximately 400,000 jin of rice. The improvement of carbon rods alone can save 14,000 jin of rice per month. The Repair Factory created more than 20 new records, the most noteworthy of which is the creation of insulating paint that is superior to imported products. In the new record movement, the factory also improved the method of operating silicon steel sheets for electric motor cores, increasing production efficiency tenfold. Liu Baoxing, a section chief at the Electric Power Bureau, invented a vacuum baking oven, which increased voltage six times higher than before, shortened working hours by more than fourteen times, and reduced labor by eighteen times. Hao Erxiao and others improved the method of cleaning the scale in the copper tubes of generator condensers, reducing the overhaul time from ten times to one, overcoming the phenomenon of a load of 3,000 kilowatts, a vacuum drop to 440 meters, and damage to the machine's lifespan. The bureau's machines now have a load of 3,000 kilowatts, and the vacuum can rise to 650 meters, saving an average of 600 kilograms of coal per day.

During the new record movement, employees of various factories and mines also put forward many rationalization proposals for improving tools and operating methods. In the innovation record movement, the leadership, in view of the fact that most of the machines in Shanxi factories are relatively old and the technical equipment is extremely poor, emphasized the importance of improving technology and machines and operation methods to maximize the efficiency of the machines. More than a dozen factories and mines in Taiyuan have successively established "Technical Research Associations (or Groups)" to give play to the collective creativity of employees. Many major creations and improvements are the result of collective research by technicians and workers. However, some leading cadres in factories and mines still have conservative ideas, which hinder the progress of the movement. Some factories and mines fail to provide timely material rewards to employees for their creations, or the rewards are too small, or the reward methods are inappropriate. The Repair Factory created more than 20 new records, but only one was rewarded. Workers in the Tobacco Company who meet quality standards for the whole month are awarded only a little more than four jin of rice, while a blue card for failing to meet standards results in a fine of three jin of rice. Penalties are more frequent than rewards, which greatly affects the production enthusiasm of employees. Some losses have also been caused by not paying attention to workers' rationalization proposals. For example, a 110-horsepower motor burned out in the No. 2 Factory of the Electric Power Bureau. Workers had previously suggested installing surge arresters, but this was not adopted in time, resulting in unnecessary losses.

　　山西公营厂矿开展创新纪录运动
    注意提高技术改进设备
    有些单位存在技术保守思想，不重视工人合理的建议和忽视奖励的偏向，应该迅速纠正。
    【本报太原讯】山西各公营厂矿的创造新纪录运动，现已全面展开。至八月底止，已有四十多个公营主要厂矿卷入运动，涌现了大批发明、创造及合理化建议，为国家创造了大量财富。据统计：太原市省营十一个厂矿中，在六月份创造了十五件提高质量、减少废品、消灭事故、节省原材料的新纪录，至七月份，新纪录即增至五十二件。工业化学公司由三月份到九月下旬创造了五十二件新纪录，前后所创造的价值共约四十余万斤米，仅炭精棒的改进，全月即可节省一万四千斤米。修造厂共创造新纪录二十余件，最值得提出的是创造了较舶来品为优的绝缘漆；该厂并在新纪录运动中，改进了?磨电动机铁心磁铁片操作法，使生产效率提高十倍。电业局股长刘宝星发明真空烤油器，使电压较前提高六倍，工时缩短十四倍以上，人工减少十八倍。郝尔孝等改进了清洗发电机凝结器铜管子中集垢的方法，使检修时间由十次减到一次，克服了过去负荷三千千瓦、真空降到四百四十米、损坏机器寿命的现象。该局机器现在负荷三千千瓦，真空可上升到六百五十米，每天还平均节省煤六百公斤。
    各厂矿职工在新纪录运动中，并提出许多改进工具，改进操作方法的合理化建议。在创新纪录运动中，领导上鉴于山西各厂大部分机器都比较古老，技术装备极差，乃强调提出提高技术，改进机器与操作法，以发挥机器效能。太原市十余个厂矿曾先后成立了“技术研究会（或组）”的组织，发挥职工的集体创造才能，许多主要创造、改进都是技术人员与工人集体研究的结晶。但是，某些厂矿领导干部，仍存在着保守思想，妨碍运动的进展。有的厂矿对职工的创造不能给以及时的物质奖励，或奖励轻微，或奖励办法不适当。修造厂职工创造新纪录二十余件，得到奖励的仅一件。烟草公司包装工人全月合乎质量标准的挂红牌，只奖给四斤多米；而挂一次蓝牌就罚三斤米。处罚多于奖励，职工生产情绪大受影响。有的还因不重视工人合理化建议而招致损失，如电业局二厂烧坏一百一十马力电动机，事先工人曾建议按设避电器，没有及时采纳，以致造成不应有的损失。
