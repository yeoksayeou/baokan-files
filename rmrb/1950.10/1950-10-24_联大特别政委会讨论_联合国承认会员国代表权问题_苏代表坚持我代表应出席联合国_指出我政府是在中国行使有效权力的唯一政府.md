Xinhua News Agency, 23rd - The United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee began discussing the Cuban proposal on "The Question of Representation of Member States in the United Nations" on the 20th. The discussion continued at the meeting on the 21st.

The Cuban proposal attempts to put forward a "unified procedure" for determining the representation of member states in the United Nations, but this "procedure" violates the UN Charter and established practices.

Soviet representative, Mr. Tsarapkin, stated at the meeting on the 21st, that there were serious inconsistencies between the Cuban delegation’s suggestions and the practices accepted by the United Nations. Mr. Tsarapkin pointed out that international practice demonstrates that a country's participation in conferences or organizations does not depend on whether that country is formally recognized by other countries. International issues, international economic relations, and politics all greatly require the participation of those countries and governments not formally recognized by one group or another in international conferences and international organizations to decide various international issues. However, the United States violates this international practice and tries every possible means to prevent representatives of the People's Republic of China from joining the United Nations organization to participate in the work of the United Nations. They disregard the fact that the participation of the representatives of the People's Republic of China is legitimate and is directly based on the United Nations Charter and the principles of respecting the sovereignty of UN member states and non-interference in their internal affairs. The participation of representatives of the People's Republic of China in the work of the United Nations organization is necessary for maintaining and strengthening international peace and security and promoting cooperation among nations.

Mr. Tsarapkin said that the fact that remnants of the Kuomintang clique, abandoned by the Chinese people, who cannot represent their country, still attend various UN organizations as "representatives" is intolerable. These people have neither the political rights, moral rights, nor legal rights to represent China in the United Nations because, as everyone knows, the political group they represent - the Kuomintang clique - is not the government exercising effective power in China. No one can doubt that only the representatives appointed by the People's Republic of China can represent China and the Chinese people in the United Nations, because this is the only government exercising effective power in China, which is a member of the United Nations organization.

Mr. Tsarapkin pointed out that, in this light, the basic provisions of international law regarding the recognition of the representation of member states of the United Nations fully support the provision that the United Nations organization can and should only recognize the credentials of the representatives of member states appointed by the government exercising effective power within the member state of the United Nations. When the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the General Assembly, and other UN organizations, under the pressure of the United States and countries supporting the United States, prevent the People's Republic of China from exercising its right of representation in various UN bodies, they are violating the UN Charter.

The Soviet delegation believes that in the matter of the United Nations organization recognizing the representation of its member states, people should base themselves on the fact that the United Nations organization can only recognize the credentials of the representatives of member states appointed by the government exercising effective power within its member state.

Mr. Tsarapkin then specifically criticized the various illegal provisions in the Cuban proposal on this issue. The Cuban proposal stipulates that the General Assembly is the sole body for deciding on the issue of representation in various UN agencies, but the rules of procedure of the main bodies of the United Nations, such as the UN Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, and the Trusteeship Council, stipulate that each body can decide on the issue of the credentials of the representatives of member states within that body.

Mr. Tsarapkin finally pointed out that the Cuban proposal attempts to make the issue of the representation of UN member states dependent on domestic political situations, crudely violating the UN Charter. He finally said that the Soviet delegation will vote against the proposal put forward by the Cuban delegation.

British representative, Sir Gladwyn Jebb, had declared at the meeting on the 20th that the Cuban proposal was unacceptable. He put forward his own proposal at the meeting on the 21st, but it was not discussed at the meeting that day.

During the two days of meetings, the representative of the Dominican Republic expressed doubts as to whether the committee was qualified to take action on the issues raised in the Cuban proposal. The representative of Peru and the representative of the Kuomintang echoed the Cuban proposal.

　　联大特别政委会讨论“联合国承认会员国代表权问题”
    苏代表坚持我代表应出席联合国
    指出我政府是在中国行使有效权力的唯一政府
   【新华社二十三日讯】联合国大会特别政治委员会二十日开始讨论古巴所提“联合国承认会员国代表权问题”案，二十一日会议继续讨论。
   古巴提案企图提出一个决定联合国会员国代表权的“统一程序”，但是这个“程序”却是违反联合国宪章与惯例的。
   苏联代表查拉普金在二十一日会议上发言指出：古巴代表团的各项建议与联合国所接受的惯例之间，存在着严重的不符之处。查拉普金指出：国际上的惯例表明，某一国家参加会议或组织等，绝不以某国是否为其他国家所正式承认或不承认而定。国际问题、国际经济关系与政策，都非常需要那些并不为这一集团或那一集团国家所正式承认的国家与政府参加国际会议与国际组织，以决定各种国际问题。但是美国违反这种国际惯例，千方百计地阻碍中华人民共和国的代表加入联合国组织以便参加联合国的工作。他们不顾以下的事实，即中华人民共和国代表的参加是合法的，是直接以联合国宪章以及尊重联合国会员国的主权与不干涉它们内政的原则为根据的。中华人民共和国的代表参加联合国组织的工作，是为保持并加强国际和平与安全以及促进各国的合作所必需的。
   查拉普金说：一些不能代表自己国家的被中国人民唾弃的残余分子仍以“代表”资格出席联合国各组织，这种情况是不能容忍的。这些人既没有政治权利和道德权利，也没有法律权利来代表中国参加联合国，因为大家知道：他们所代表的政治集团——国民党集团并不是在中国行使有效权力的政府。没有人能够怀疑，只有中华人民共和国委派的代表才能在联合国中代表中国和中国人民，因为这是在作为联合国组织的会员国之一的中国行使有效权力的唯一政府。
   查拉普金指出：这样看来，国际法中关于承认联合国会员国的代表权的基本规定，是完全支持联合国组织只能而且只应承认在联合国会员国内行使有效权力的政府所任命的代表的全权证书的规定的。当安全理事会、经社理事会、大会和联合国其他组织在美国和支持美国的国家的压力下，阻止中华人民共和国行使其在联合国各机构中的代表权时，它们违反了联合国宪章。
   苏联代表团认为：在联合国组织承认其会员国的代表权的问题上，人们应当依据一个事实：联合国组织只能承认在其会员国内行使有效权力的政府所任命的会员国代表的全权证书。
   查拉普金继而具体批评关于这个问题的古巴提案中的各项非法规定。古巴提案规定大会为决定关于联合国各机构代表权问题的唯一机关，但是联合国安理会、经社理事会和托管理事会等主要机构的议事规则都规定：各机构可以自行决定该机构内会员国代表的全权证书问题。
   查拉普金最后指出：古巴提案企图使联合国会员国代表权问题取决于国内政治情况，粗鲁地破坏了联合国宪章。他最后说：苏联代表团将投票反对古巴代表团所提出的提案。
   英国代表沙士克斯曾在二十日会议上宣称：古巴提案是不能接受的。他在二十一日会议上提出了英国自己的提案。但当日会议未予讨论。
   在两日会议中多米尼加共和国代表对于委员会是否有资格对古巴提案中所提出的问题采取行动，表示怀疑。秘鲁代表与国民党代表附和古巴提议。
