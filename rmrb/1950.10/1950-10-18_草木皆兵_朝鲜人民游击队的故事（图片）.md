    Every Tree and Bush an Enemy - The Story of the Korean People's Guerrilla Force
    Peng Bin
    (1) A group of Syngman Rhee bandits and "American advisors" went from Chilgok to the countryside, hanging up and beating Korean farmers like mad dogs, forcing them to "surrender and return to the right path."
    (2) The puppet village chief invited them to eat dog meat and drink shochu. They devoured it greedily.
    (3) They got drunk and then climbed into the car, intending to return to Chilgok. By then, it was almost dark.

    草木皆兵——朝鲜人民游击队的故事
    彭彬
    （一）一群李承晚匪帮和“美国顾问”从七谷到乡下，像疯狗似的把朝鲜农民吊起来毒打，强迫农民“归顺反正”。
    （二）伪面长（乡长）请他们吃狗肉、喝烧酒。他们就狼吞虎咽地大吃大喝起来。
    （三）他们喝得酩酊大醉后，才爬上汽车，打算回七谷去。那时，天已快黑了。
