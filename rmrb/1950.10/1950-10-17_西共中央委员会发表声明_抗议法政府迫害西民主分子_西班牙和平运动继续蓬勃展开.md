　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 8th: L'Humanité published a statement by the Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party, protesting the French government's mass arrest and expulsion of Spanish Republicans residing in France in early September, and exposing the essence of this reactionary measure by the Pleven government.
　　The statement said: The Pleven-Moch government has taken brutal retaliatory measures against Spanish Republicans, closing Spanish democratic newspapers, depriving members of the Spanish Communist Party and the Catalan Unified Socialist Party of their civil rights, arresting them and exiling them to the barren mountains of Corsica and the deserts of North Africa. The French reactionaries fabricated the excuse that the Spanish Communist Party "is conspiring to endanger French security" to carry out their shameless deeds. However, the French people know that the real reason for persecuting Spanish Communists in France is that the vast majority of Spanish expatriates have openly declared their determination to dedicate themselves to the cause of peace, with 200,000 of them signing the peace declaration. American imperialists hope to stifle the voices of Spanish peace fighters and remove all obstacles in their path so that they can include the fascist Franco regime in their system of war and aggression, so that they can use Spain as a strategic base in the new war they are planning and drive the Spanish people to be cannon fodder. In taking this measure, the French government has become a tool of American imperialists and the Franco Gestapo.
　　The statement pointed out: While the French government is expelling Spaniards who fought for the freedom and independence of France, many Franco agents are carrying out espionage activities under various guises, organizing provocative incidents. Supported by American agents, they have been ordered to organize the assassination of the great leader of the Spanish people, Ibarruri, and other leaders of the party. The French authorities are doing nothing to stop them.
　　The statement continued: The Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party firmly protests these retaliatory actions that violate the French Constitution and the law on the right of asylum. It thanks the French people for their solidarity and expresses its militant condolences to the persecuted Spanish Communists and loyal democrats. The statement calls on those who are persecuted to gloriously assume the glorious title of advanced fighters for peace and democracy, regardless of the current difficult situation, and calls on Communists and all peace supporters to support the persecuted victims and their families.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 10th: Despite the terror of the Franco fascist rule, the peace signature campaign in Spain is still flourishing. The Trebal newspaper, secretly published in Catalonia, eastern Spain, has recently distributed thousands of Stockholm Declarations to people from all walks of life. Many men and women citizens and anti-fascists in the eastern coastal city of Alicante, Mallorca, and Cordoba in the south have signed the peace declaration. Peace advocates in Barcelona collected 2,000 signatures in a few days. The wives and children of Spanish guerrillas killed by Franco's executioners bravely participated in the peace signature campaign. The slogan "The Spanish people are fighting for peace" often appears on the walls of Franco police stations in various guerrilla areas. When guerrilla units in various places attack villages and towns under Franco's rule, they often hold mass meetings in the villages to explain the great significance of the movement to defend peace to the villagers.

　　西共中央委员会发表声明
    抗议法政府迫害西民主分子
    西班牙和平运动继续蓬勃展开
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社巴黎八日讯：人道报刊载西班牙共产党中央委员会声明，抗议法国政府于九月上旬大批逮捕驱逐旅法的西班牙共和分子，并揭露普利文政府这一反动措施的本质。
    声明称：普利文——莫克政府对西班牙共和分子采取横暴的报复手段，封闭西班牙民主报刊，剥夺西班牙共产党党员和加泰隆尼亚统一社会党党员的公权，把他们加以逮捕并放逐到科西嘉岛的荒山中和北非沙漠里。法国反动派捏造了西班牙共产党“正在阴谋违害法国安全”的借口，来遂行其无耻的勾当。然而，法国人民都知道，迫害旅法西班牙共产党的真正理由，是因为绝大多数西班牙侨民公开宣布了献身和平事业的决心，他们中间有二十万人在和平宣言上签了名。美国帝国主义者希望扼杀西班牙和平斗士的呼声，清除其道路上的一切障碍，以便将法西斯佛朗哥政权列入其战争与侵略的体系中，好让他们在正在策划的新战争中利用西班牙为战略基地，驱使西班牙人民当炮灰。法国政府在采取这一措施时，变成美帝国主义者与佛朗哥盖斯塔波的工具。
    声明指出：当法国政府驱逐曾为法国的自由和独立而斗争的西班牙人的时候，许多佛朗哥的特务却在各种伪装下进行间谍活动，组织挑拨性事件。他们为美国特务所支持，已受命组织暗杀西班牙人民伟大领袖伊巴露丽和党的其他领袖们的工作。而法国当局竟毫不加以阻拦。
    声明继称：西班牙共产党中央委员会坚决抗议这些违反法国宪法与避难权利法的报复行动。感谢法国人民的声援；并向被迫害的西班牙共产党员与忠实的民主分子表示战斗的慰问。声明号召遭受迫害者不顾当前的困难处境，光荣地负起和平与民主的先进战士的光辉称号，并号召共产党员与一切和平拥护者声援遭受迫害的受难者及其家属。
    【新华社十三日讯】电通社巴黎十日讯：西班牙的和平签名运动虽在佛朗哥法西斯的恐怖统治下，仍然蓬勃发展。在西班牙东部加泰隆尼亚秘密出版的特雷巴尔报，最近已向各阶层人民散发了数以千计的斯德哥尔摩宣言。东海岸亚利干的城、马佐卡岛及南部的科尔多巴城的许多男女公民和反法西斯人士，都已在和平宣言上签了名。巴塞罗那的和平拥护者数天之内就征集了两千人的签名。被佛朗哥刽子手杀害的西班牙游击队员的妻子与儿女们，英勇地参加了和平签名运动。“西班牙人民正在为和平而斗争”的标语，时常出现在各游击区的佛朗哥警察局的墙壁上。各地的游击队伍在袭击佛朗哥统治下的各村镇时，常常在村中举行群众大会，向村民阐明保卫和平运动的重大意义。
