Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The German Democratic Republic (GDR) national election is scheduled to be held on the 15th. GDR Deputy Prime Minister Walter Ulbricht gave a statement to reporters on the 13th, elucidating the significance of this election.

Ulbricht first stated: Without a doubt, the United States can only launch a war in Europe after controlling the majority of the people in West Germany. This means that if the people of the German Democratic Republic vote for peace in the elections, if the majority of the people in West Germany also demonstrate their will to defend peace, and if all German youth uniformly refuse to serve the American and German warmongers, then we can stop the war.

Ulbricht further pointed out: To safeguard peace, Germany must be reunified on a democratic basis; however, as long as the warmongers can do as they please in West Germany, there can be no talk of peace. To reunify Germany on a democratic basis, the people of the Republic must win the support of all peace-loving patriotic forces in West Germany for the National Front of Democratic Germany. This force must launch a nationwide resistance movement sufficient to eliminate the Adenauer puppet regime and promote the democratic victory of West Germany.

Ulbricht said: The struggle of the National Front of Democratic Germany will be guaranteed to achieve final victory because: Firstly, the National Front is fighting with all its might to defend peace. Secondly, the success of the Republic's Five-Year Plan will prove that a planned economy is far superior to the economic anarchy in West Germany; the people of West Germany have increasingly seen that American financial capital treats West Germany as a colony, while the major powers of the peace camp maintain friendly relations with the Democratic Germany.

Ulbricht emphasized the great significance of the Republic's economic construction, saying: The improvement of the living standards of the people of Democratic Germany will have a powerful effect. It is undoubtedly true that the people of West Germany would rather live in a unified and independent Germany than be ruled by the dictatorial regime of American and West German bankers and industrialists. Ulbricht said: If the unification of Democratic Germany is completed, West German industry can be fully operational. The recent trade agreement between Democratic Germany and People's China stipulates a trade volume that is even higher than the trade volume between pre-war Germany and China. Democratic Germany has joined the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance of Eastern European democratic countries, headed by the Soviet Union. These facts prove that Germany can independently solve its own problems without being financially dependent on the United States.

Ulbricht finally said: After the all-German elections, peaceful construction will continue to be actively carried out. The new parliament will pass a new Five-Year Plan. After the elections, the most important task will be to unite and organize the struggle of all patriotic forces in West Germany to expand the national resistance movement against the acts of American financial capital to re-militarize and colonize West Germany.

    乌布利希阐明德国大选意义
    全德人民在选举时投票拥护和平，就可以制止战争。
    【新华社十五日讯】德意志民主共和国全国大选定于十五日举行。德意志民主共和国副总理乌布利希特于十三日对记者发表谈话，阐明此次大选的意义。
    乌布利希首称：毫无疑问，美国只有在控制了西德大部分人民之后，才能在欧洲发动战争。这就是说，如果德意志民主共和国的人民在选举时投票拥护和平，如果西德大多数人民也表现出他们保卫和平的意志，同时德国全体青年一律拒绝为美德战争贩子服役，那么我们就可以制止战争。
    乌布利希进一步指出：为要维护和平，就必须要在民主基础上把德国重新统一起来；但是，只要战争贩子一天在西德可以为所欲为，那么，就谈不到和平。要在民主基础上重新统一德国，共和国人民就必须争取西德的一切爱好和平的爱国力量支持民主德国全国阵线。这种力量一定要开展足以铲除阿登纳傀儡政权并促成西德民主胜利的全国规模的抵抗运动。
    乌布利希说：民主德国全国阵线的斗争将保证取得最后胜利，因为：第一，全国阵线以全力为保卫和平而斗争。第二，共和国五年计划的成功将会证明计划经济远比西德的经济上无政府状态为优越；西德人民已日渐看出美国金融资本把西德当作殖民地，而和平阵营的大国却与民主德国保持友好关系。
    乌布利希强调说明共和国经济建设的巨大意义称：民主德国人民生活水平的提高将发生有力的效果。西德人民当然愿意在一个统一和独立的德国里生活，而不愿受美国和西德银行家和工业家的独裁政权所统治，这是无可怀疑的。乌布利希说：倘使民主德国的统一完成，西德工业就可以全部开工。民主德国与人民中国在最近的贸易协定中规定贸易额比战前全德国与中国的贸易额还要高，民主德国已参加了以苏联为首的东欧各民主国家的经济互助委员会，这些事实证明德国可以独立解决它的切身问题而无需在财政上依存于美国。
    乌布利希最后说：全德大选后将继续积极进行和平建设。新议会将通过新五年计划。选举之后，最主要的任务将是统一和组织西德一切爱国力量的斗争，以扩大民族抵抗运动，反对美国金融资本重新使西德军国主义化和殖民地化的行为。
