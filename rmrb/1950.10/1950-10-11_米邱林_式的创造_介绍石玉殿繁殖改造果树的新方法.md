    We cannot wait for nature's benevolence; our task is to wrest [things] from nature. – Michurin

    The Extraordinary Orchard
    The area around Lin County in Pingyuan Province is one of hills and sandy beaches, with only scattered, verdant trees. However, if you go to the area around Dongye Village, you will find lush greenery and birdsong. If you stay there longer, you will discover many amazing miracles in the orchard: a persimmon tree bearing five kinds of persimmons, differing in size, hardness, taste. Clearly the root of a willow tree, yet bearing the leaves of apricots, peaches, chestnuts, etc., and blossoming with various colors and bearing fruit of different shapes and tastes according to the season.

    Who created this extraordinary orchard? An ordinary old farmer. His name is Shi Yudian. If you meet him in the fields, he will speak endlessly with you about many stories of transforming fruit trees.

    Grapes Growing on a Black Date Tree
    Shi Yudian has been grafting trees for forty-three years. At the age of fourteen, while herding cattle for the landlord, he learned grafting from an old man next door. Since then, he has grafted trees for others every year. At the age of twenty-one, he saw a gardener peeling off a section of bark from two flowering trees and grafting them together, wrapping them tightly with mud and thatch. The second year, he pruned the trunk of the good flowering tree and the crown of the bad one, thus improving the flower variety. He also used this method to graft persimmon trees and black date trees together, and the second year, the persimmons that grew were larger and better.

    In 1920, his hometown experienced a very bad year, and many people starved to death. But those who planted persimmon trees all safely survived the disaster. Since then, he has paid even more attention to cultivating fruit trees.

    Once, he had the whimsical idea of pulling a grape vine onto a black date tree, breaking the bark of both trees, wrapping them tightly with mud and thatch. The second year, he sawed off the grape vine trunk and the crown of the black date tree. When he picked the grapes in the autumn and ate them, they had no seeds! Later, he tried grafting grapes with many other trees, and the results were fruitful. He tried grafting persimmon trees onto pine, cypress, poplar, tung, and ailanthus trees using this method, and it could also bear fruit, but it didn't taste good.

    He created a variety of grafting methods to improve fruit. Apples grafted onto sour plum trees grew twice as large. The second and third years, re-grafting onto the already grafted apple branch resulted in even larger apples. Crabapples grafted onto flowering crabapple trees only bore fruit every other year after being grafted once, but after being grafted twice, they could bear large and abundant fruit every year. Peaches grafted onto willow branches tasted a bit bitter after being grafted only once. After being grafted twice, they became sweet and delicious.

    He also tried grafting black date trees to black date trees, drilling a hole in the trunk of one black date tree and inserting a branch from another black date tree, then sealing it with mud and wrapping it with thatch. The second year, seedless black dates grew!

    New Grafting Methods
    Practice makes perfect, and he created new grafting methods.

    The first method is "branch insertion," which involves sawing off the black date tree trunk, splitting it with an axe, and then inserting and clamping two persimmon tree branches, sealing them with mud, without even needing to wrap them with thatch.

    The second method is "bark clasping," which involves peeling off the bark of the persimmon tree and finding the "bony protrusions" (i.e., where branches will sprout) on the inner layer of the bark, cutting out a piece with a knife, and holding it in the grafter's mouth. Separately, on the black date tree trunk, remove a piece of bark of the same size, then paste the persimmon tree bark held in the mouth onto it, binding it tightly with thatch, and then cutting off the black date tree crown. New buds will grow at the "bark clasping" site. The first "bark clasping" will still produce black dates, but the second "bark clasping" will grow persimmons. This grafting method can be widely applied to many trees.

    He also deeply studied which solar terms and grafting methods could be used to graft which kinds of trees.

    New Afforestation Method
    He explored a new method of layering to propagate trees. The branches of fruit trees near the ground are pressed into the ground, allowing the branch tips and leaves to emerge above the ground. After the branches buried in the ground grow roots, the part connecting the new roots to the original trunk is cut off. Layering in this way makes it easy to turn the ground into a lush orchard.

    On mountain slopes, this method is used to layer branches near the upper edge of terraced fields. If the fruit tree has already been grafted, the branches are layered above the terraced field to take root and grow, eliminating the need for further grafting. Using this method, beautiful fruit trees multiply layer by layer along the terrain of the terraced fields.

    On level ground, soil can be placed in flower pots or broken pots, which are tied to the tree. The branch tips are layered according to the method above, which can also grow new trees that can be moved to other places for planting.

    Treating Fruit Tree Dystocia
    One warm spring, Shi Yudian went to the field and saw that cattle and sheep often ran into the field to eat his crops. He asked a carpenter to drill a hole in the trunk of a fruit tree that had not borne fruit for many years along the roadside, making it into a fence to block cattle and sheep. In the autumn, unexpectedly, this tree was laden with fine fruit. After careful observation and research, he came up with a theory: use "acupuncture" to treat non-bearing fruit trees; that is, during the Qingming Festival, drill a two- to three-inch deep hole on each of the four sides of the non-bearing fruit tree trunk about eight inches from the ground. If only one branch on a fruit tree does not bear fruit, this method can also be used to give the branch a few acupuncture treatments, and it can bear fruit that year. He also has other effective remedies for treating non-bearing fruit trees: for example, if persimmon trees on mountain slopes no longer bear fruit, dig a pit at the base of the tree; if apple trees no longer bear fruit, cut the bark with a small knife; if prickly ash trees no longer bear fruit, prune the hairy branches on the trunk. Last year alone, he cured more than a hundred non-bearing fruit trees. These methods can even increase the yield of certain crops, such as removing the unopened flower heads of hemp seeds during the White Dew solar term, stripping the small sprouts on both sides of the opened flowers, and removing the hairy legs at the bottom of the stalks, so that the hemp seeds will be plump and full.

    Not Guarding Grafting Techniques
    Shi Yudian's life is inextricably linked to trees. As long as others are willing, he is willing to spend effort to help. Over the past forty-three years, he has grafted more than 20,000 trees for his village and neighboring villages. He never guards his "secrets" of grafting, constantly teaching grafting techniques to others. In his own village alone, he has taught more than four hundred people. He has taught countless people within twenty miles of the village.

    In recent years, he has become even more enthusiastic. He often propagandizes to the masses: "In lean years, those without fruit trees go hungry, those with fruit trees eat their fill every year." "Planting fruit trees is highly profitable," "A big flood can flood the crops, but it can't flood the trees." Under his leadership, Dongye Village planted more than 5,000 trees the year before last, more than 3,000 trees last year, and more than 9,000 trees this year. Now every household is also raising nurseries.

    Now, in the area around Dongye Village, fruit forests are densely populated and connected from village to village. The income of the masses has increased, and life is getting stronger day by day. When they mention Shi Yudian, no one fails to praise him.

    Shi Yudian's creation is extremely similar to that of Michurin, the world-renowned Soviet fruit tree cultivation reformer. Studying and promoting the experience of this outstanding people's genius in improving fruit trees is a very important matter.

　　“米邱林”式的创造
     ——介绍石玉殿繁殖改造果树的新方法
    曾文经
    我们不能等待自然的恩惠，我们的任务是向自然界去夺龋——米邱林
    奇异的果树林
    平原省林县一带，一片山丘沙滩，只有零落的苍翠的树木。可是，如果你到东冶村一带，那里却是绿树成荫，好鸟争鸣。要是你再在那里多待一个时候，你就会在树林里发现许多使人惊异的奇迹：一棵柿树，结着五种大小、硬软、味道不同的柿子。分明是一棵柳树根，却长着杏、桃、栗等各种叶子，并随着季节，开放各色花朵和长出形状味道不同的果子。
    是谁创造这奇异的果树林？是一个普通的庄稼老汉。他的名字叫石玉殿，你要是在田间遇见他，他会滔滔不绝地和你讲解许多改造果树的故事。
    黑枣树干上结葡萄
    石玉殿已经接了四十三年树。十四岁时，他给地主放牛，就已向邻居老汉学会了接树。以后，年年替别人接树。二十一岁时，他看见花匠把两棵花树剥了一段皮，接在一起，用泥和茅草包札好，第二年剪去好的花树的树干和不好的花树的树头，这样就能改进花的品种。他也用这种方法，把柿子树和黑枣树接起来，第二年，结的柿子又大又好。
    一九二○年他的家乡年景很坏，饿死了许多人。但凡是种柿子树的，都安全的度过了灾荒。从此，他对养果木树就更加注意了。
    有一次，他异想天开地把葡萄的树干扯到黑枣树上，把两棵树的树皮都弄破，用泥和茅草包札起来，第二年，再把葡萄的树干和黑枣的树头锯断，秋天把葡萄摘下来吃，喝！全都没核啦。后来他又试把葡萄和许多树木接起来，结果都能长出果实。他试用这种方法在松、柏、杨、桐、椿等树杆上接柿子树，也可以结成果实，只是味道不好吃。
    他创造了多种接木改进果实的方法。苹果接在酸梅树上，苹果结的大一倍。第二年，第三年在已接木的苹果杆上再接，苹果就结的更大了。花红在海棠树杆上接木，接了一次，只是结一年，歇一年；接了两次，就能年年结着又大又稠的果子。桃树接在柳树杆上，只接一次，桃子味道有点苦。接了两次，就甜美可口了。
    他又试把黑枣树和黑枣树相接，在一棵黑枣树杆上凿孔，把另一棵黑枣树的树枝插进去，再用泥土糊上，用茅草包札好，第二年，长出没核的黑枣来！
    新接树法
    熟能生巧，他又创造了新的接树方法。
    第一种方法是“插枝”，即把黑枣树杆锯断，用斧劈开，然后用两枝柿子树枝插上夹住，用泥土糊上，不用茅草缠也能活了。
    第二种方法是“扣皮”，即把柿子的树皮剥下来，找出那树皮的里层有“骨突”的地方（即长出枝芽处），用刀裁作一块，噙在植树人口里。另外在黑枣树杆上划去同样大小的一块树皮，然后用噙在口里的柿子树皮贴上去用茅草紧紧地捆住，再砍断黑枣的树头“扣皮”处就长出新芽来了。第一次“扣皮”时，还是结黑枣，等到第二次“扣皮”，就长出柿子来了。这样接木方法，可以广泛应用在许多树木上。
    他还深入地研究在什么节气，用什么接树方法，能接什么样的树。
    造林新法
    他摸索出了新压枝法来繁殖树木。把果树接近地面的枝压在地下，让类端枝叶露出地面，等压在地下的树枝长出根后，便把新根与原树干相连部分砍断，这样压枝，很容易就能使地上变成一片葱郁的树林。
    在山地树梢挨近上边梯田地方，用这方法压枝。如果这果树是经过接枝的，在上面梯田经过压枝生根成长，就不用再接木了。采用这种方法后，美丽的果树便随着梯田的地势，一层层往上繁殖起来。
    在平地上，如用花盆或破锅放上泥土，束在树上。将树梢依照上法压枝，也同样可以长出新树，并可挪到其他地方去种植。
    医治果树的难产症
    一个暖和的春天，石玉殿到地里去，看到牛羊常跑到地里去吃自己的庄稼，他便请木匠在道边一棵多年不结果的果树茎干上钻了个孔，做成栅栏来挡牛羊。到了秋天，想不到这棵树竟是佳果累累了。他细心观察研究后，想出了一条道理：用“打针”方法去治不结果的果树；即在清明节时，在不结果的果树离地八寸许的茎干处，四面各钻一个两三寸深的眼。如果一株果树上有一枝不结果，也可以采用这方法在枝上打几针，当年就可以结果了。他还有别的医治果树不结果的良方：如山地的柿树不结了，就在树根处刨个坑；苹果树不结了，就用小刀把树皮切破；花椒不结了，就把树干的毛枝剪去。只在去年他就治好了不结果的果树百余棵。这些方法，甚至可以增加某些作物的产量，如白露时将大麻子上没开花的头打去，开花的扒去两旁小芽，去掉杆下边的毛腿，这样就能使麻子结实饱满。
    不保守接树技术
    石玉殿的一生，和树木结了不可解的因缘。只要别人愿意，他就肯白花工夫去帮助。四十三年来，他共给本村和邻村接树两万多棵。他从来不保守自己接树的“秘诀”，经常不断地把接树技术教给别人，只在本村就已教会了四百多人。在外村二十里内，到处传授，说不清教会了多少人。
    近几年来，他越搞越起劲啦。他经常向群众宣传：“没果树的荒年挨饿，有果树的年年吃饱。”“种果树利大”“水大淹了庄稼，淹不了树。”在他带头领导下，东冶村前年栽树五千多棵，去年三千多棵，今年九千多棵，现在还家家都养苗圃。
    现在东冶村一带，果林密布，村村相接。群众的收入增加了，光景一天比一天强。他们一提起石玉殿，没有一个人不啧啧称赞。
    石玉殿的创造，和世界闻名的苏联果树栽培改革家的米邱林极相近似。研究和推广这位优秀的人民天才改良果木的经验，是一件很重要的事情。
