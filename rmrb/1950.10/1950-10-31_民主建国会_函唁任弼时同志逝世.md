    China Democratic National Construction Association
    Condolence Letter on Comrade Ren Bishi's Death

    [Xinhua News Agency, October 30th] The China Democratic National Construction Association today sent a letter to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, offering condolences on the death of Comrade Ren Bishi. The condolence letter is as follows:

    Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:

    The death of Mr. Ren Bishi is a great loss to the Chinese people! At a time when the construction of the new China is just beginning, and the aggressive flames of American imperialism are raging across the Asian continent, we urgently need him. However, he has passed away! The people of China and the comrades of this association are deeply saddened by this! However, his firm, indomitable, and ever-victorious fighting example has been disseminated even more widely because of his death. In remembrance of him, everyone is willing to learn from him, and this will become an even greater new force. We hope that your party will lead us more closely, learn from Comrade Ren Bishi's example, and enable us to make more contributions to the revolution in the future!

    With revolutionary greetings,
                              China Democratic National Construction Association, October 30, 1950
