　　Excerpts from Submitted Articles
    *News Work* frequently receives submissions from readers, many of which cannot be published due to space limitations or the quality of the original work. However, many contain good ideas and excerpts that are worth publishing, and it would be a shame to discard them entirely. Therefore, starting with this issue, we are introducing a new column called "Excerpts from Submitted Articles" to select and publish works that are not suitable for full publication but can be published in excerpt form.
          ——Editor
    Regarding Reports of New Records
    Workers in various regions have created many new records, and newspapers have reported extensively on these records, attracting significant attention.
    However, every new record has its scope. When reporting on new records, it should be specified whether the record belongs to the factory itself, the industry sector, the city, the province, the major administrative region, or even the entire country or the world. If this scope is not clarified, it is difficult to estimate its value.
    Apart from the scope of the factory itself, the production standards and records of a certain task within an industry sector, a city, a province, a major administrative region, the country, or the world are not known to everyone, but the leading organs of enterprises at all levels should and can know them. When newspapers handle these submissions, they should first inquire with the local city, province, major administrative region, or even the central enterprise leading organs to determine the scope of the new record before publishing it. This would have a greater impact.
    (This excerpt is from Comrade Xun Chang's submission, "Several Suggestions on Reporting Industrial Construction and the Workers' Movement.")
    Several Forms of the Readers' Letters Page
    Form is determined by content. Because social life is multifaceted and rich, and readers' letters are also multifaceted and rich, the editors of the readers' letters page must inevitably create various different forms in processing the letters. Some of the readers' letters pages in newspapers across the country have already created certain types of columns, some of which are worth introducing.
    1.  Letters Synthesis: The editor comprehensively processes letters dealing with similar issues. This shows the broadness of the issue, draws attention, saves space, and allows the editor to make necessary edits and improvements in the synthesis. For example, on August 17th, an article was published synthesizing readers' criticisms of medical workers over the past half-month; on August 13th, *Liberation Daily* synthesized more than 100 letters of condolence to the Korean people. This form can even be applied to readers' opinions on a particular film or drama. Certain agencies that have the most contact with the masses, such as courts, public security bureaus, and tax bureaus, can also adopt a comprehensive response approach to some general issues of concern to readers.
    2.  Masses' Life, Life Correspondence: Reflects the real people and events in the current life and struggle of the masses (primarily workers, peasants, and soldiers), which is to "inspire readers to report on the many moving events of the current great struggle." It is a short correspondence with literary interest, and it can also be timely coordinated with the current central work (such as the moving true stories in the peace signature campaign), which is extremely combative.
    3.  Special Topic Discussions, Work Research: This form can guide the masses to express their opinions on a certain issue. The former often targets a major current issue and organizes discussions, such as the *Changjiang Daily*'s continuous discussion of "Who Fed the Landlords?" on the land reform issue; the *Liberation Daily*'s discussion of "Do Heroes Create the Times? Do the Times Create Heroes?" on the issue of the masses creating history. Both have achieved considerable propaganda effects. The latter focuses on specific issues in work, such as "Trade Union Work" and "How to Eliminate Bureaucratic Red Tape," introduces experiences, and organizes discussions.
    Of course, these forms are created according to the situation of the letters and based on the needs of the content. Readers' letters are diverse. If these columns are available and then made fixed, that is not right. New content in the letters should be explored more, and new forms should be created.

### 来稿文摘

专栏：来稿文摘

　　来稿文摘
    《新闻工作》经常收到读者的来稿，其中有许多或者因限于篇幅，或者因限于原作的质量，常常无法刊载。但其中也有不少好的意见和可以发表的片段，如果全加以舍弃是非常可惜的，因此从这一期起特辟出“来稿文摘”一栏，选载一些不拟全文刊载，但可以摘要发表的作品。
          ——编者
    关于新纪录的报道
    各地职工创造了许多新纪录，报纸上对这些新纪录作了许多报道，很引起人们的重视。
    但是每一种新纪录都是有范围的。报道新纪录，应该说明这种新纪录是属于本厂的，还是本产业部门、本市、本省、本大行政区、乃至全国、全世界的新纪录。这种范围不讲清楚，就使人难以估计其价值。
    除了本厂范围的之外，一个产业部门，一市、一省、一个大行政区、全国、全世界上某一项工作的生产标准和纪录，并不是人人都能晓得的，但各级企业领导机关却应该也可能知道。报纸在处理这些稿件时，就应该先向当地的市、省、大行政区以至中央的企业领导机关询问一下，判定这一项新纪录是属于那个范围内的，然后再发表，其作用会更大些。
    （本文摘自荀昌同志来稿《关于报道工业建设及工人运动的几点意见》）
    读者来信版的几种形式
    形式是内容决定的，因为社会生活是多方面的、丰富的，读者来信也是多方面的、丰富的，读者来信版的编辑也必然要在处理来信中创造各种不同的形式。现在各地报纸的读者来信版上有的已经创造出了一定型式的专栏，其中有些是值得加以介绍的。
    一、来信综合：编者将同类性质问题的来信，加以综合处理，这样既可表示问题的广泛性，引起重视，又可以节省篇幅，并由编者在综合中加以必要的整理和提高。例如八月十七日就发表了一篇半月来读者对医务工作者的综合批评；八月十三日解放日报综合了一百多封致朝鲜人民的慰问信。这种形式甚至可以应用到读者对某一影片、戏剧的意见上来。某些和群众接触最多的机关，如法院、公安局、税务局，对于一些读者关切的带有普遍性的问题，也可以采取综合答复的方式。
    二、群众生活、生活通讯：反映群众（首先是工农兵）当前生活和斗争中的真人真事，也就是“启发读者来对目前伟大斗争的许多动人事件进行报道”，它是一种短小的有文艺趣味的通讯，它也可以及时配合目前中心工作，（例如和平签名运动中动人的真实故事。）极富战斗性。
    三、专题漫谈、工作研究：这种形式可以引导群众就某一问题发表意见。前者多针对目前某一重大问题，组织讨论，如对于土改问题，长江日报进行了连续的“地主是谁养活的？”的讨论；对于群众创造历史的观点问题，解放日报作了“英雄造时势？时势造英雄？”的讨论。都收到了相当大的宣传效果。后者则针对工作中的具体问题，如“工会工作”，“如何消灭公文旅行”等，介绍经验并组织讨论。
    自然，这些形式都是依照来信的情况，根据内容上的需要创造出来的。读者来信是多种多样的，如果有了这些专栏而就使它定型起来，那是不对的，应该更多地发掘来信中的新内容，创造新形式。
