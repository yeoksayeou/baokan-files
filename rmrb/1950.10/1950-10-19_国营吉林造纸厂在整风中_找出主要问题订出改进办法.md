[Northeast News] According to the Jilin Daily, the state-owned Jilin Paper Mill in the Northeast region has examined major problems in production during rectification and has proposed specific improvement measures. The mill began its rectification on August 25th. The leadership first identified the main problems to be examined based on the current specific situation, and convened a plant-wide rectification meeting with preparation. After discussion, revision, and supplementation, the focus of rectification was determined. The mill's rectification was carried out in two steps, according to the urgency and severity of the problems, for inspection and summary. First, the focus was on examining technical management issues in order to stabilize production, improve quality, and reduce costs; later, the focus was on resolving issues such as capital, cost management, wage policies, and workshop economic accounting systems.

During the study of rectification documents and instructions from higher authorities, the principle of combining rectification with actual work was firmly grasped. Based on the mill's situation, it was decided to first focus on examining leadership work in capital construction as the rectification priority. Leading cadres from the factory's Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League adopted methods such as individual conversations, small-scale chats, and relevant cadre meetings to solicit opinions from the masses and initially examined the work. This initial examination was then discussed in the Communist Party General Branch Committee. Non-Party responsible cadres were also invited to participate in the discussion. A self-critical review report was made to encourage cadres inside and outside the Party to examine the work and examine the leadership. Because the mill's leadership had a clearer understanding of this rectification, made relatively adequate preparations in advance, and used the correct methods of combining studying documents with examining work, combining leadership with the masses, and combining Party members with non-Party members during the rectification process, the mill's rectification movement achieved significant results. In the examination work, not only were problems exposed, but the causes of the problems were also analyzed, and solutions were found, achieving the goal of improving work while examining. For example, during the examination, work began on formulating various technical management systems, standard operating procedures, cleaning systems, etc. In order to strengthen the technical management of the workshops, a foreman training class (seven days, now completed) was also held to conduct business education centered on operating methods, in order to master operating business and implement systems. Some problems that need to be solved urgently are researched and resolved by the competent departments, and they are not relaxed because of the rectification, or waited until they are solved together. On the contrary, solving problems is faster and more timely. In order to better improve the work, three special meetings on production, construction, and business are also planned to be held. Analyze and summarize the various problems and solutions that have been checked out and submit them to special meetings for research and resolution. Currently, preparations are being made to convene a special meeting on production, which will focus on resolving: ① the division of labor between the factory director, engineers, and technical departments; ② standard operating procedures; ③ quality inspection responsibility system; ④ equipment operation regulations; ⑤ cleaning system. But there are also shortcomings in the rectification. The main reason is that the spirit of this rectification was not implemented in every cadre who participated in the rectification. As a result, some cadres did not know how to examine their work, and some were unwilling to participate in the work meeting, thinking that they could solve more problems by going to the site, and they opposed the rectification with the examination work. Therefore, in the future, we should continue to implement the spirit of this rectification among all cadres participating in the rectification.

　　国营吉林造纸厂在整风中
    找出主要问题订出改进办法
    【东北讯】据吉林日报消息：东北区国营吉林造纸厂，在整风中检查了生产上存在的主要问题，并提出具体改进办法。该厂自八月二十五日开始整风，该厂领导上首先根据当前具体情况，找出要检查的主要问题，有准备地召开全厂整风会议，经过讨论、修正、补充后，确定了整风重点。该厂整风是按问题缓急与严重程度，分两步进行检查与总结的。首先着重检查技术管理问题，以达稳定产量、提高质量和降低成本的目的；以后着重解决资金、成本管理、工资政策、车间经济核算制等问题。
    在学习整风文件和上级的指示中，紧紧掌握了整风应和实际工作相结合的原则，根据本厂情况，确定首先以检查基本建设中的领导工作为整风重点，由工厂党、行政、工会及青年团的领导干部，采取个别交谈、小型漫谈和举行有关干部会议等方式，征询群众意见，初步检查了工作。然后将这个初步的检查在共产党总支委员会讨论。讨论中并吸收非党员负责干部参加，以自我批评精神作了启发性的检讨报告，动员党内外干部检查工作，检查领导。由于该厂领导上对此次整风有较明确的认识，事先作了较充分的准备工作，又在整风过程中运用了学习文件与检查工作、领导与群众、党内与党外相结合的正确方法，使该厂的整风运动，获得了较显著的成绩。在检查工作中不仅揭发了问题，并分析了问题产生的原因，找出解决问题的办法，作到了一边检查，一边改进工作。如在检查中就着手拟定技术管理上的各种制度、标准操作法、清洁制度等。为了加强车间的技术管理，还举办了一个工长训练班（七天，现已结束），以操作法为中心进行业务教育，以便掌握操作业务，贯彻制度。对当前急需解决的一些问题，各由主管部门研究解决，并不因为整风就放松了，或者是等到一起解决。相反的，解决问题是更迅速及时了。为了更好的改进工作，还准备召开生产、修建、业务等三个专门会议。把检查出来的各项问题和解决办法，分析归纳提交专门会议研究解决。目前正准备召开生产方面的专门会议，会议上将着重解决：①厂长、工程师、技术部门的分工问题；②标准操作法；③质量检查责任制；④设备使用规程；⑤清洁制度。但在整风中也有缺点。主要是没把这次整风的精神贯彻到所有参加整风的每个干部中去。致使个别干部不知怎样检查自己的工作，有的不愿参加检查工作会议，以为去现场可多解决几个问题，把整风与检查工作对立起来。因此，今后还应在所有参加整风的干部中，继续贯彻这次整风精神。
