　　Central Trade Department Decides to Prevent Farmers from Being Hurt by Low Grain Prices
    Vigorously Purchases New Grain to Stabilize Grain Prices
    And Fully Prepares Industrial Products for Rural Areas to Meet Farmers' Needs After Selling New Grain.
    [Our Dispatch] Since March, the general trend of national prices has been stable. However, within this stability, the following characteristics have emerged from July to the present: In terms of cotton cloth, because the state has fully supplied the people and controls a large amount of cotton cloth, the price of cotton cloth has remained stable. In terms of grain, new situations have emerged after the successive market entry of northern wheat, autumn grain (millet, corn, sorghum), and southern early rice: When southern early rice began to enter the market in early August, it once fell, but after the purchase by state-owned trading companies in mid-August, it tended to stabilize; however, as of the end of August, the market price of rice in Wuhan, Changsha, Guangzhou and other places was still lower than the listed price. Northern wheat, because the state-owned trading company's purchase price this year was low and the regional difference was large, merchants purchased a lot due to the profit of trafficking; in addition, many public and private units sold a large amount of old grain in exchange for new wheat, and farmers also actively sold their grain, seeing the prospect of a good autumn harvest, thus forming a slight increase in the price of wheat and a decline in the price of coarse grain, especially in medium-sized cities. For example, in mid-August: the market price of millet in Shijiazhuang was 20% lower than the listed price, and the market price of millet in Xinxiang was as much as 30% lower than the listed price. Therefore, although the price of cotton cloth was stable, the difference between cotton cloth and grain gradually expanded due to the decline in grain prices. From July 31 to August 31, the national flower and cotton cloth index decreased by only 1.8%, while the grain index decreased by 5.6%. It is estimated that the above situation will continue to develop after the autumn harvest, which will lead to a continued expansion of the price difference between industrial and agricultural products, which is unfavorable to farmers and wage-earning laborers who calculate wages in grain.
    In view of the above situation, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government has decided to take the following steps to continue to consolidate the general policy of stabilizing prices: vigorously expand the purchase of new grain to stabilize the price of coarse grain and prevent it from falling. If the current market price is much lower than the listed price, the grain company should actively purchase it to bring the listed price close to equilibrium. And maintain a reasonable seasonal price difference for grain between this autumn and next spring, because the new grain has a high moisture content and must be stored until next spring to be sold, so interest, warehouse consumption and storage costs must be deducted. Secondly, maintain the price of new cotton equivalent to 8 to 10 catties of millet and 7.5 to 8.5 catties of rice to protect the interests of cotton farmers and promote increased cotton production next year. Try to stabilize the price of cotton cloth as much as possible, and strive to maintain the existing difference between industrial and agricultural products, so as not to expand it excessively.
    At the same time, in order to prevent the excessive issuance of currency from causing price fluctuations in some areas during the purchase, state-owned trading companies should also fully prepare a large number of industrial products for rural areas, especially cotton cloth, kerosene, and general merchandise, and grain should be transported to cotton-producing areas and grain-deficient areas. In short, we must make full preparations according to the specific requirements of farmers in various places in order to meet the various needs of farmers after selling new grain and new cotton.

　　中央贸易部决定防止谷贱伤农
    大力收购新粮稳定粮价
    并充分准备工业品下乡，以满足出卖新粮后农民的需要。
    【本报讯】全国物价自三月以来到目前为止总的趋向是稳定的。但在稳定当中，从七月到现在却呈现出如下的特点：在纱布方面，由于国家为了充分供应人民，掌握了大量纱布，因此纱布价格一直保持平稳。在粮食方面，从北方小麦、秋粮（小米、玉米、红粮）与南方早稻相继上市后，便出现了新的情况：南方早稻八月上旬开始登场时曾一度下落，八月中旬后，在国营贸易公司收购下，趋于稳定；但迄至八月底止，汉口、长沙、广州等地市场米价仍低于牌价。北方小麦，由于今年国营贸易公司收购价格较低，地区差额较大，商人因贩运有利，收购很多；加上不少公私单位为换购新麦抛出大批旧存粗粮，农民见大秋有望亦踊跃出售，因此形成麦价微升，粗粮下落。特别在中等城市更为明显。如八月中旬：石家庄市小米市价低于牌价百分之二十，新乡小米市价低于牌价达百分之三十。因此，虽然纱布价平稳，因粮食下落，纱布与粮食的差额亦逐渐扩大。如七月三十一日到八月三十一日，全国六大城市花纱布类指数仅降低百分之一点八，粮食类指数却降低百分之五点六。估计以上情况在秋收后将继续发展，这将形成工农业产品差价的继续扩大，对农民及以粮食计算工资的工薪劳动者是不利的。
    中央人民政府贸易部根据以上情况，决定在继续巩固物价的总方针下，采取如下步骤：大力展开收购新粮工作，以稳定粗粮价格不使下落。现在市价低于牌价很多，应由粮食公司积极收购，使牌市价接近平衡。并保持今秋明春间粮食的合理季节差价，这是因为新粮水分大，且须存到明春才能出售，须减去利息、仓耗及仓储费用。其次，保持新棉价格相当于小米八斤至十斤，大米七斤半至八斤半的标准，以保障棉农利益，促进明年棉花增产。尽可能稳定纱布价格，力求保持现有工农业产品之差额，不使过分扩大。
    同时为了不使收购时因投放货币过多引起局部地区物价波动起见，国营贸易公司并应充分准备大量工业品下乡，尤其是纱布、煤油、百货，产棉区和缺粮地区则应运销粮食。总之，须根据各地农民具体要求，充分准备，才能满足出卖新粮新棉后农民的各种需要。
