Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 24th (TASS): Sidorov published an article in today's "Red Fleet Newspaper," exposing the role of the British Navy as a tool for the colonial expansion of British imperialism. He emphasized that the entire history of the British Navy is a history of plundering foreign territories and oppressing and enslaving the people of other countries.

Sidorov analyzed in detail the historical facts of the British Navy's criminal acts since the era of the Great Geographical Discoveries and wrote: Even in our era, after the end of World War II, the British Navy continues to play the role of oppressor of national liberation movements. British naval fleets are currently stationed around the world, using force to maintain the rule of British imperialism in colonies and dependent countries. They brazenly interfere in the internal affairs of other countries in an attempt to destroy democracy and freedom and establish reactionary regimes there.

The US and British imperialists have turned the port of Trieste into their naval base. Although according to the peace treaty with Italy, all foreign armed forces should have withdrawn from the Free Territory of Trieste long ago, the United States and Britain continue to keep their troops stationed there. British and American ships frequently use the port of Trieste as their base. British naval vessels have repeatedly been sent to Sudan, Somaliland, Eritrea, and other colonies in the Far East and Middle East to suppress the movements of the people of those colonies against British imperialism. British ships participated in the struggle to attack the Indonesian Republic in an attempt to restore the rule of British and Dutch imperialism there.

Sidorov then drew the reader's attention to the fact that the British Navy has been participating in the war against the people of Malaya for more than two years, and the people of Malaya had already begun their national liberation struggle during the Japanese occupation. A British Royal Marine brigade is participating in military operations to attack the patriots of Malaya.

Sidorov continued that during the Chinese civil war, the British Navy also played a role in supporting international reactionaries. At the end of 1948 and the beginning of 1949, when the Chinese People's Liberation Army defeated Chiang Kai-shek's army, Britain sent an aircraft carrier, a cruiser, several destroyers, and patrol boats to the Far East. Not only that, but it also transferred a brigade of marines from Malta to Hong Kong.

The British Far East Fleet has been helping the armed forces of American imperialism attack the freedom-loving people of Korea for almost four months. British naval vessels have been carrying out piratical attacks on the Korean coast, killing peaceful residents. Airplanes taking off from British aircraft carriers have been bombing peaceful cities and villages, destroying many hospitals, theaters, and cultural relics.

The British Navy serves the aggressive purposes of British imperialism. However, the oppressed people in British colonies and other independent countries are rising up to fight for the independence and freedom of their countries and for liberation from the shackles of US and British imperialism. Sidorov concluded that no force can stop these people from achieving their lofty goals. All progressive humanity is sympathetically concerned with their glorious struggle.

　　英海军为扩张侵略工具
    远东舰队充当美国侵朝帮凶
    苏《红海军报》著文揭露
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日电：西多罗夫在今天的《红海军报》上发表一文，揭露英国海军作为英帝国主义殖民地扩张的工具所起的作用。他强调指出，英国海军的全部历史就是一部掠夺外国领土的历史，压迫与奴役他国人民的历史。
    西多罗夫详细分析了英国海军自伟大地理发现时代起所进行的犯罪行为的历史事实，并且写道：甚至在我们这时代，在第二次世界大战结束以后，英国的海军还继续起着民族解放运动压迫者的作用。英国海军的舰队现正驻在世界各地，凭用武力维持英帝国主义在殖民地和附属国家中的统治权。它们放肆地干涉他国的内政，以图在那里摧毁民主自由并建立反动政权。
    美英帝国主义者已把的里雅斯特港变为它们的海军基地。虽然根据对意和约一切外国武装部队早应该自的里雅斯特自由区撤退，但美英两国继续把他们的军队留驻在那里。英国和美国的船舰经常利用的里雅斯特港，作为它们的基地。英国海军的舰只一再被派往苏丹、索马里兰、厄立特里亚和远东及中东其他殖民地，去镇压那些殖民地人民反对英帝国主义者的运动。英国的船舰曾参加进攻印尼共和国的斗争，以图恢复英国和荷兰帝国主义在那里的统治权。
    西多罗夫接着唤起读者注意，英国海军参与对马来亚人民的战争已经两年有余，而马来亚人民在日军占领期间就已开始他们的民族解放斗争了。英国海军陆战队一旅在参加进攻马来亚爱国者的军事行动。
    西多罗夫继称，在中国的内战当中，英国海军也曾负起支持国际反动派的作用。在一九四八年底和一九四九年初，当中国人民解放军打垮蒋介石的军队时，英国曾派一艘航空母舰、一艘巡洋舰、若干驱逐舰和巡逻艇到远东去。不仅如此，它又从马耳他岛调了一旅陆战队到香港去。
    英国远东舰队帮同美国帝国主义武装部队进攻爱好自由的朝鲜人民，差不多已有四个月之久。英国的海军舰只对朝鲜的海岸作海盗式的袭击，杀害和平的居民。自英国航空母舰起飞的飞机空袭和平的城市与乡村，摧毁了许多医院、剧院和文物。
    英国的海军是为英帝国主义的侵略目的服务的。但是，英国殖民地和其他独立国家被压迫的人民正纷纷起来，为他们国家的独立与自由、为从美英帝国主义羁绊中解放而斗争。西多罗夫最后写道，没有一种力量能够阻止这些人民达到他们崇高的目的。一切进步的人类都在同情地关心着他们光荣的斗争。
