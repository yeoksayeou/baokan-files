　　On Lu Xun's Patriotic and Anti-Imperialist Thought
　　Zhou Jianren

　　Lu Xun was a person who loved his country. I think that if he hadn't been so enthusiastic about loving his country, it would have been impossible for him to become a staunch and unyielding revolutionary.

　　As early as 1903, Lu Xun (who was in Tokyo, Japan at the time) gave Xu Shoushang a poem with a self-portrait: "No plan have cloud terrace to escape the divine arrow, the wind and rain are dark over the homeland, the intention of the cold star is not examined, I offer my blood to Xuanyuan." Xu Shoushang explained, "The first line says how deeply he was stimulated by studying abroad, the second describes the state of the motherland being battered by wind and rain from afar, the third describes the feeling of loneliness as compatriots have not awakened. The last line directly expresses his aspirations, and is a motto he practiced throughout his life."

　　Three years later, while watching a movie in Japan, he saw a Chinese man being accused by a Japanese warlord of being a military spy for Russia (during the Russo-Japanese War) and was about to be beheaded as a warning to the public. But there were many Chinese standing by watching blankly, showing a numb expression. From then on, Lu Xun abandoned medicine and switched to literature and art, wanting to change their spirit. This also shows his patriotic enthusiasm.

　　Later, most of Lu Xun's articles were written to attack feudalism, the Northern Warlords, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, but he never relaxed his opposition to imperialism for a moment. He often told us why some imperialists abused and killed Chinese people, why they held children upside down by their feet, and so on. However, Lu Xun knew very well that the evil deeds of feudalism (in semi-colonial society) and even the Kuomintang reactionaries were supported by imperialism, and imperialist aggression also relied on the betrayal of running dogs and the help of feudalism and other backward elements. Therefore, anti-imperialism must oppose feudalism and the Kuomintang reactionary running dogs. He had these words to tell everyone: "It is certainly right to use pen and tongue to tell everyone the suffering of being reduced to slaves of foreign races, but one must be very careful not to let everyone come to the conclusion: 'Then, it is better to be slaves of our own people like us.'" Here, we can see the reason why Lu Xun's patriotic and anti-imperialist pen often pointed at feudalism, the Northern Warlords, and the Kuomintang reactionaries.

　　His old friend Xu Shoushang used these words to describe Lu Xun's patriotism and anti-imperialism: "For more than thirty years, he struggled arduously until his death, completely sacrificing himself for the survival of the Chinese nation. As long as there was a breath left, he would not allow himself to slack off. His thoughts only moved forward, but his principles were always consistent."

　　If Lu Xun were still alive, he would be furious to see today's fascist American imperialists frantically supporting Chiang Kai-shek's running dogs, attempting to prevent the liberation of the Taiwanese people, and helping Syngman Rhee to massacre the Korean people and carry out aggression! But everyone sees that the day the imperialists become fascist is also the day they accelerate their own demise! Victory will surely belong to the peace-loving people, it can be asserted. Loving peace is not passive, nor is it non-resistance. It is active, and when necessary, it does not hesitate to "go through fire and water" to achieve it, and it will definitely be achieved.

　　关于鲁迅的爱国反帝思想
    周建人
    鲁迅是一个热爱祖国的人。我想，要是他不热心爱国，不可能成为一个坚强不屈的革命者的。
    早在一九○三年的时候，鲁迅（这时候在日本东京）送给许寿裳一首自题小像的诗：“云台无计逃神矢，风雨如磐黯故园，寄意寒星荃不察，我以我血荐轩辕。”许寿裳解释道：“首句说留学外邦所受刺激之深，次写遥望故国风雨飘摇之状，三述同胞未醒，不胜寂寞之感。末了直抒怀抱，是一句毕生实践的格言。”
    三年后，在日本看电影，见一个中国人被日本军阀指为替俄国做军事侦探（在日俄战争时期）正要斩下头来示众。旁边却有许多中国人站着呆看，显出麻木的神情。鲁迅从此舍医学，改学文艺，要想改变他们的精神。这里也表示他的热心爱国。
    后来鲁迅的文章多数是为了攻击封建主义，北洋军阀，以及国民党反动派而发的，对于反对帝国主义心里并不一刻放松。他常对我们讲述某些帝国主义者为何虐杀中国人，为何倒提小孩的脚而去等等，但是鲁迅知道的非常明白，封建主义（在半殖民地社会里）以至国民党反动派的作恶，是靠帝国主义的支持的，帝国主义的侵略，也依赖走狗们的卖国，及封建主义等落后性的帮助。所以反帝是必须反封建及国民党反动派走狗的。他有这样的话告诉大家：“用笔和舌，将沦为异族的奴隶之苦告诉大家，自然是不错的，但要十分小心，不可使大家得着这样的结论：‘那么，到底还不如我们似的做自己人的奴隶好。’”这里可以看出爱国反帝的鲁迅笔锋所指所以多向封建主义，北洋军阀，国民党反动派的理由了。
    他的老友许寿裳对于鲁迅的爱国与反帝用这样的话来形容，他说：“三十余年来，刻苦奋斗以至于死，完全是为中华民族的生存而牺牲，一息尚存，不容稍懈；思想只管向前迈进而主义却是始终一贯的”。
    鲁迅要是还活着，看到今天法西斯化的美帝国主义者疯狂的支持蒋介石走狗，妄图阻止台湾人民的解放，与帮助李承晚，屠杀朝鲜人民，肆行侵略，不知将如何忿怒！但是大家看着，帝国主义者法西斯化之时也就是加速自己灭亡之日！胜利是必定属于爱和平的人民，是可以断言的。爱和平不是消极的，不是无抵抗主义。却是积极的，必要的时候，不惜“赴汤蹈火”以求实现，也一定能够实现的。
