　　Hunan's Pilot Land Reform Program Nears Completion
    Mature Experiences Will Guide Land Reform Throughout the Province
    [Changsha Dispatch from this Newspaper] The pilot land reform program in Hunan Province is nearing completion. This is an important step in preparing for land reform, with the aim of gaining more mature experience to guide land reform work throughout the province. The province has a total of forty-seven pilot townships, eight of which are directly led by the Provincial Land Reform Committee and the Provincial Farmers' Association, and the rest are led by the land reform committees and farmers' associations of various special districts. The pilot townships are distributed in six special districts: Changsha, Yiyang, Changde, Shaoyang, Hengyang, and Lingling, including lakeside areas, hilly areas, mountainous areas, old revolutionary base areas, special crop areas, and areas with more ponds and dams and water conservancy facilities, in order to understand various situations related to land reform and gain experience in carrying out land reform in various different regions. The pilot program began in early July and has gone through stages of investigation and research, policy propaganda, rectification of the peasant ranks, and class differentiation, and has now entered the stage of confiscation, requisition, and distribution. Experience will be summarized in early October. A few townships, such as Longwang and Lishan in Shaoyang, Dengbo in Xiangtan, and Siqu in Pingjiang, have now been completely concluded.
    The peasants warmly support land reform. During the autumn grain collection in Li Yu Township, Langli District, Changsha, the peasants put forward the slogan "Complete grain delivery early, divide the land early," and completed the grain collection and storage work within seven days. Some peasants in the township whose grain had not yet dried, other peasants would lend it to them first to pay the public grain. Peasants in Huangni Village, Liuyang, and other places "tended the rice during the day" and discussed land distribution in the evening.
    The emancipated peasants who have already been distributed land have improved their production enthusiasm and their lives have begun to be guaranteed. Yi Guilin, who had been a hired laborer for twenty years in Dengbo Township, Xiangtan, was allocated ten piculs of paddy field, two rooms, five plots of garden land, a small piece of mountain forest, and other farm implements.
    Hired laborer Huang Mingfu's family of seven was allocated thirty-six piculs of paddy field and three tile-roofed houses. He plans to raise two pigs next year, cultivate the land, and also take on some odd jobs, with a minimum income of fifty piculs of grain, which can reach a slightly lower than middle-peasant level of living. Tenant farmer Xiao Chuansheng used to rent land from landlords, and after deducting rent, deposit interest, and seed grain, his family's average annual income was less than three piculs of grain per person. Now that he has his own land, although it is less than the land he used to rent, he can still have five piculs of grain left per person after deducting public grain, and his life can be appropriately improved. After the peasants in Siqu Township, Pingjiang, finished distributing the land, they wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, expressing that their emancipation was thanks to Chairman Mao, and guaranteed that they would "work hard in production, cultivate meticulously, produce more grain, respond to the government's various calls, and consolidate the fruits of victory." After the land distribution in Longwang and Lishan Townships, Shaoyang, a peasant emancipation meeting was held to discuss the production plans for small-scale planting and winter cultivation after the autumn harvest.

　　湖南土改典型试验即将完成
    将取得成熟经验指导全省土改
    【本报长沙讯】湖南省的土地改革典型试验工作，已接近完成。这是准备土地改革的一个重要步骤，目的是取得较成熟的经验，用以指导全省土地改革工作。该省共有四十七个典型试验乡，其中有八个是由省土地改革委员会与省农民协会直接领导的，其余为各专区的土改委员会和农会分别领导。典型试验乡分布在长沙、益阳、常德、邵阳、衡阳、零陵六个专区，包括滨湖、邱陵地、山地、老苏区、特种作物区和塘坝、水利较多的地区，以便了解有关土改的各种情况，取得在各种不同地区进行土改的经验。典型试验从七月初开始，经过调查研究、宣传政策、整顿农民队伍、划分阶级等阶段，已进入没收、征收和分配阶段。十月初即进行总结经验。少数乡，如邵阳的龙王、栗山两乡，湘潭的邓波乡，平江的驷曲乡等，现在已经全部结束。
    农民热烈拥护土地改革。长沙榔梨区黎圫乡秋征时，农民提出“早完粮，早分田”的口号，七天内就完成了征粮入仓工作。该乡有的农民的谷还未干，其他农民就先借给他交上公粮。浏阳黄泥村等地农民，白天“扮禾”，晚上讨论分田。
    已经分完土地的翻身农民，生产情绪提高，生活开始有了保障。湘潭邓波乡做了二十年雇工的易桂林，分到十石谷田，两间房，五块园土，一小片山林和其他农具等。
    雇工黄明福全家七口人，分到三十六石谷田，三间瓦房。他计划着明年养上两口猪，种上田，再揽点零工，至少收入五十石谷，可以达到稍次于中农的生活水平。佃贫农萧传生过去租种地主的田，除去租子、押金息谷、禾种之外，全家每人平均每年收入不到三石谷。现在自己有了田，虽然比过去佃种的田是少了些，但除去公粮外，每人还可剩五石谷，生活可以适当提高。平江泗曲乡农民分完土地后，给毛主席写了信，表示翻身多亏了毛主席，并保证“努力生产，精耕细作，多打粮食，响应政府各种号召，巩固胜利果实。”邵阳龙王、栗山两乡分完土地后，召开了农民翻身大会，讨论了秋收后小种和冬耕的生产计划。（光军）
