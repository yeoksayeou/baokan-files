　　Zhejiang Province, Some Areas
    Special Agents Discovered Sabotaging Autumn Grain Collection
　  Zhejiang Daily Short Commentary Points Out That Resolute Suppression of Principal Culprits and Intensified Promotion of Autumn Grain Collection Policies to the Masses Are Necessary
    [Reported by this newspaper] In some areas of Zhejiang Province, bandits, special agents, and some unlawful landlords were discovered inciting the masses to sabotage grain collection during the autumn grain collection. From the end of September to the first ten days of October, in certain villages of Jinhua, Lanxi, Yongkang, Yiwu, and Wuyi counties in the Jinhua Special District, and Fenghua, Cixi, and Zhenhai counties in the Ningbo Special District, and Xinchang county in the Shaoxing Special District, dozens of incidents of counter-revolutionaries sabotaging autumn grain collection were discovered. These counter-revolutionaries spread rumors, saying "this year's agricultural tax is heavier than last year," attempting to incite farmers to "petition" the People's Government under the slogan of "reducing production." Special agents also adopted methods such as assassinating township cadres, seizing township cadres' guns, and infiltrating farmers' conferences, clamoring against fixed output quotas to disrupt the meetings. After the rice harvest, some unlawful landlords arbitrarily left rice paddies uncultivated, attempting to resist grain collection and sabotage production. One of the reasons why special agents dared to boldly sabotage the autumn grain collection was that some cadres did not recognize that the autumn grain collection was a fierce struggle, and lacked a high degree of vigilance against the enemy's sabotage activities. In the face of the enemy's sabotage activities, cadres in some areas even appeared hesitant and dared not boldly rely on the masses to expose and attack reactionary elements, and resolutely suppress the principal culprits. To this end, the Zhejiang Daily published a short commentary, pointing out: The People's Government must give timely, resolute, and severe suppression to the counter-revolutionary principal culprits. People should be encouraged to report and accuse them, and the Public Security Bureau and judicial organs should arrest and try them, and deal with them in accordance with the policy of "the principal culprits must be dealt with, the coerced will not be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded" as stipulated by Chairman Mao. At the same time, extensive publicity and education should be carried out among the broad masses, explaining that the People's Government's collection of agricultural taxes is taken from the people and used for the people, and that paying agricultural taxes is the duty of every citizen, so that the masses will not be threatened or deceived by bandits, special agents, and reactionary landlords.

　　浙江省部分地区  
    发现特务破坏秋征
　  浙江日报短评指出，应坚决镇压首恶分子并加紧向群众宣传秋征政策
    【本报讯】浙江省部分地区在秋征中，发现土匪特务与若干不法地主，煽动群众破坏征粮。自九月底至十月上旬，在金华专区的金华、兰溪、永康、义乌、武义，宁波专区的奉化、慈溪、镇海，绍兴专区的新昌等县的某些乡村，曾发现反革命分子破坏秋征事件达数十起。这些反革命分子进行造谣，说“今年农业税比去年重”，企图煽动农民以“降低产量”的口号向人民政府“请愿”。特务分子并采用暗杀乡干部，夺取乡干部的枪支；混入农民大会，叫嚣反对定产以捣乱会场等活动方式。若干不法地主在稻子收割后，任意荒芜稻田，企图以此抵抗征粮，破坏生产。特务分子敢于大胆破坏秋征的原因之一，是一部分干部不认识秋征是一场激烈的斗争，对敌人的破坏活动缺乏高度的警惕。个别地区的干部在敌人破坏活动面前，还表现了束手束脚，不敢大胆地依靠群众，揭发与打击反动分子，并对首恶分子实行坚决镇压。浙江日报为此发表短评，指出：人民政府对于反革命首恶分子，必须给予及时的坚决的严厉的镇压。应该鼓励人民检举告发，由公安局、司法机关逮捕审判，遵照毛主席所规定的“首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖”的政策，依法处理。同时应向广大群众进行广泛的宣传教育，说明人民政府征收农业税是取之于民，用之于民，缴纳农业税是每个国民的义务，使群众不受匪特及反动地主的威胁、欺骗。
