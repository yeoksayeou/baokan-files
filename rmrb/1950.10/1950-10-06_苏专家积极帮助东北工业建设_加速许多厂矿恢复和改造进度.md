Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 5th. Over the past year, the active assistance of Soviet experts to the state-owned industrial construction in Northeast China has accelerated the progress of the recovery and renovation of many factories and mines. Thanks to the technical guidance of Soviet experts, the output of a certain blast furnace at Anshan Iron and Steel Company has exceeded the highest level during the puppet Manchukuo period by 21%; the qualified rate of low-phosphorus iron in the iron smelting plant of Benxi Coal and Iron Company has increased from 16% in February to 88.51% in May, and the output has also reached 104.6% of the prescribed task; the qualified rate of steel ingots in the steelmaking branch of the Fushun Mining Bureau Steel Plant has also increased to 95.3%, exceeding the 80% standard set by the puppet Manchukuo. With the specific help of Soviet experts, the coal mines in Northeast China have carried out a major reform of coal mining methods, making the recovery rate of thick coal seams reach 60% to 92%, which is one to two times higher than in the past.

Soviet experts attach great importance to workers' inventions and creations. When Chen Lian'gao, an old worker at Shenyang Smelting Plant, successfully created a magnesia brick converter last year, he immediately received praise from Soviet experts. Soviet experts also suggested that the plant replace all mud converters with magnesia brick furnaces, thus enabling the plant to complete the task of producing blister copper in the first half of the year ahead of schedule on April 10, and the cost of each ton of blister copper was also reduced by 120,000 yuan (Northeast currency). Later, Soviet experts further helped the plant overcome the shortcomings of the magnesia brick furnace sticking to the wall and bottom, so that the volume of the furnace would not shrink over time and the output would not decrease. When Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant trial-produced the "six-foot all-gear lathe," it adopted the suggestions of Soviet experts, and the important parts such as gears and headstocks were heat-treated, making the produced lathe durable and reducing a lot of losses for the country.

In terms of production management, Soviet experts have also provided many improvement methods. The continuous operation method and production chart system, which have now been implemented in machinery, coal mines, paper mills and other factories and mines, are advanced Soviet experiences introduced by them. After the factories of the Northeast Machinery Administration implemented the continuous operation method, the complex manufacturing work was able to proceed in an orderly manner. The Fifth Machinery Factory of the Bureau mastered the three basic charts of "production plan and completion status," "assembly and completion registration," and "parts collection registration," overcoming the shortcomings of not being able to complete tasks on time in the past. Shixian Paper Mill has also strengthened workshop technical management and improved the machine operation rate to 97%. As a result, the plant's production tasks can be completed on time or ahead of schedule every month. According to the suggestions of Soviet experts, the Chemical Engineering Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company made a huge diagram of all the machinery and equipment of the entire chemical plant, indicating the specified temperature, pressure, operating time and precautions for each machine, and hung it on the site, so that technicians could use it to educate workers and managers could use it to check work.

Soviet experts also pay great attention to factory safety, employee welfare and environmental sanitation. Due to the suggestions of Soviet experts, many factories and mines have improved cold-proof and heatstroke prevention equipment, thus avoiding or reducing the loss of machinery and the damage to workers' health.

### 苏专家积极帮助东北工业建设  加速许多厂矿恢复和改造进度

　　苏专家积极帮助东北工业建设
    加速许多厂矿恢复和改造进度
    【新华社沈阳五日电】一年来苏联专家对东北的国营工业建设的积极帮助，加速了许多厂矿恢复和改造的进度。由于苏联专家的技术指导，鞍山钢铁公司某高炉的产量，已超过伪满时期最高额的百分之二十一；本溪煤铁公司炼铁厂低磷铁的合格率已由二月份的百分之十六；提高到五月份的百分之八十八点五一，产量亦达规定任务的百分之一百零四点六；抚顺矿务局制钢厂炼钢分厂钢锭合格率也提高到百分之九十五点三，超过了伪满所定百分之八十的标准。在苏联专家的具体帮助下，东北各煤矿实行了采煤方法的大改革，使厚煤层的回收率已达百分之六十至九十二，较过去提高了一倍至二倍。
    苏联专家对工人的创造发明甚为重视。沈阳冶炼厂老工人陈连高去年创造镁砖真吹炉成功，即立即得到苏联专家的赞扬。苏联专家并建议该厂将泥做的真吹炉全部改为镁砖炉，因而使上半年矿石产粗铜的任务于四月十日即提前完成，每吨粗铜的成本费也降低了十二万元（东北币）。其后，苏联专家更帮助该厂克服了镁砖炉沾壁沾底的缺点，使炉的容积不致日久缩小、产量不致减少。沈阳第一机械厂试制“六尺全齿轮车床”时，采用苏联专家建议，齿轮及床头等重要零件经过热处理，使所产车床经久耐用，为国家减少很多损失。
    在生产管理方面，苏联专家也提供了很多改进办法。现已开始在机械、煤矿、造纸等厂矿实行的连续作业法、生产指示图表制等，就是他们介绍来的苏联先进经验。东北机械管理局各厂实行连续作业法后，已使工序复杂的制造工作得以有条不紊地进行。该局第五机械厂掌握了“生产计划及完成情况”、“装配及完成登记”、“零件搜集登记”三种基本图表，克服了过去不能按期完成任务的缺点。石岘造纸厂也因此加强了车间技术管理，提高了机械运转率至百分之九十七。因而该厂的生产任务每月均能按时或提前完成。鞍山钢铁公司化工部，根据苏联专家的建议，把化工厂全厂机器设备制成巨图，注明每部机器的规定温度、压力、操作时间及应注意事项，悬挂在现场，使技术人员可据此教育工人，管理人员可据此检查工作。
    苏联专家对工厂安全、职工福利及环境卫生方面也极为注意。由于苏联专家的建议，不少厂矿改进了防寒、防暑的设备，因而避免或减少了机器的损失和工人健康的损害。
