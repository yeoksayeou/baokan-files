To Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China:

Please accept my sincerest congratulations on the occasion of the National Day of the People's Republic of China. The Polish people, with great sympathy and joy, are watching the heroic liberation struggle of the Chinese people and sincerely welcome their great victory over American imperialism and its puppets.

This victory of the Chinese people, their long struggle for the complete liberation of their homeland, and their achievements in the cause of building a socialist system, make a great contribution to the struggle of the worldwide camp of peace and progress, led by the great Soviet Union, against American aggressors and for peace. On behalf of the Polish government and myself, I hope that you, Minister, and the State Council of the People's Republic of China will achieve more victories in achieving the national and social goals of the Chinese people and in the cause of permanently consolidating the camp of peace and progress.
