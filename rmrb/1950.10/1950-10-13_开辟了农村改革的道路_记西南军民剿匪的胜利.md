　　Opening the Road to Rural Reform
　　—A Record of the Victory of the Southwest Army and People in Suppressing Bandits

The People's Liberation Army, which marched into the Great Southwest, after defeating the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's last base on the mainland for launching a traitorous civil war, has heroically plunged into the extremely arduous struggle to suppress bandits. In the ten months from last December to the end of September this year, with the joint efforts of the army and people, 400,000 bandits have been eliminated. Transportation lines and the wealthy heartland areas have been purified, rural order has been stabilized, and urban-rural transportation has begun to recover, paving the way for the implementation of rural reform in the future.

Suppressing bandits and counter-revolutionaries was originally the first step in opening up the work situation in the newly liberated areas. The Southwest, being the last area liberated on the mainland, saw a large number of Chiang Kai-shek bandit remnants rely on feudal forces and transform into bandits to make a final struggle in the Southwest. In response to this situation, the Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China reminded all cadres at the end of the Southwest Campaign that "the real war is still ahead," requiring everyone to be fully prepared ideologically and organizationally. The Southwest Military Region called on the entire army to continue to carry forward its past tenacious spirit, comprehensively launch bandit suppression work, and resolutely eliminate bandits who were enemies of the people.

As the Great Southwest Campaign turned towards its conclusion, these bandit and secret agent forces, which had been dispersed and hidden, waiting for an opportunity, gradually moved from a chaotic and scattered state to organized assembly from the end of February onwards, and universally launched criminal activities of sabotage and robbery in various towns, especially in the countryside. March and April were the times when the bandit situation in the Southwest was more serious. The most significant feature of their activities was that they had extremely obvious political purposes. General He Long, Commander of the Southwest Military Region, gave such a vivid explanation with examples of what he had seen and heard: The large number of bandits in the Southwest was a crime left over from years of feudal separatism and reactionary rule by the Kuomintang. As everyone knows, many reactionary warlords in Sichuan started by relying on landlord forces and bandits; they were the leaders of the bandits, and many of them swore brotherhood with the bandits; even the army was composed of a "three-three system": regular army, bandits, and Gelaohui (secret society) each accounted for one-third. The army universities, middle schools, and primary schools they established were all schools for training bandits. As for the rural feudal forces, they remained untouched due to the rapid development of the war. The township and bao (group of households) armed forces were the direct pawns of the landlord forces in exploiting the people. Therefore, the people hated them the most. Before liberation, there was a folk saying: "The township head is a man of great fortune, the bao head is fat and slippery, the jia (subdivision of a bao) head is a dog guarding the township, and the common people shed tears!" But the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, with the nature of jackals, still felt that the people's tears were not dry enough and imposed a special agent rule to create riots. Therefore, long before the liberation of the Southwest, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits Mao Renfeng, Wang Lingji and their ilk recruited local bullies and habitual bandits in Chengdu to run five "Guerrilla Cadre Training Classes," successively training more than 5,000 so-called "guerrilla cadres." "Fuxing," "CC"… there were as many as seventeen types. They all received American-made guns, cannons, and bullets in Chengdu. After liberation, these bandit and special agent elements took advantage of the gap when our army was busy dealing with post-war affairs, and with the support of American and British imperialism, erected reactionary banners such as the so-called "Border Area Guerrilla Team" and "People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army" on the Southwest border and in the mountainous areas of the country, combining feudal forces, local ruffians, habitual bandits, and scattered regular bandit troops, reaching more than 400,000 at one time. These bandits universally launched the so-called "Southwest Mainland Guerrilla War" in various places in March, killing people, setting fires, destroying production, looting warehouses, robbing passers-by, and assassinating working personnel, making it difficult for land and water transportation to pass without sufficient troops to cover them. This not only caused social unrest and affected the progress of construction and production work, but also caused a lot of losses to cadres and the masses. Larger incidents include: In western Sichuan, bandit special agents gathered more than 2,000 bandits on February 6th and rioted in the Longtan Temple and Shiban Tan areas east of Chengdu, killing 60 people including the political director of our division; Mo Fenglou, a gentry and democratic personage from Dushan County, Guizhou, was brutally murdered along with his entire family of 43 people by bandit special agents in early May because he firmly refused to join the bandits. A specially invited representative of the people from all walks of life in Ba County, eastern Sichuan, Mr. Chen, also died with his entire family because he refused to join the bandits. They even forced each jia to provide one person and one gun, coercing the people to join the bandits, threatening to kill people and burn houses if they refused. Many farmers were victimized; and they created various rumors to incite people's hearts. All this shows that the bandit suppression work in the Southwest is essentially a struggle to eliminate the remnants of the American imperialist running dogs—the Chiang Kai-shek bandits—and to oppose feudalism.

However, in the early days of liberation, many working personnel (and even the general public) underestimated the seriousness of this struggle, not only suffering some unnecessary losses, but also relaxing the suppression of the ringleaders, which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. But not long after, various places quickly corrected this deviation and correctly implemented the policy of combining suppression and leniency instructed by Chairman Mao: "The ringleaders must be dealt with severely, those who were coerced will not be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded," as well as the mass line of relying on the masses, organizing the masses, and combining production and defending their homes, and achieved a basic victory in bandit suppression.

First of all, those bandit and special agent armed forces who were stubbornly unrepentant and resolutely opposed to the people were resolutely eliminated. In the bandit suppression struggle, senior cadres took the lead and personally went to the front line to fight with the troops, and the general commanders and fighters and local working cadres also showed a high degree of bravery and resourcefulness after studying the tactics against bandits and special agents. They insisted on their posts in difficult situations, resolutely attacked the activities of bandits and special agents, and reduced the losses of the masses. Here are just a few examples: The former Kuomintang army 302nd Division, which revolted in Chengdu, killed our military representatives in Mianzhu and then defected and fled into the West Mountain, looting wantonly; but after our army's long-distance pursuit, the rebel bandits were all wiped out after a day of attack. A certain unit of the Fuling Sub-district of eastern Sichuan once climbed mountains and ridges to pursue bandits for three days and nights, surrounding the bandits on a high mountain rock. Although the soldiers had not eaten for two days, in order to eliminate the bandits in front of them, they finally launched a fierce attack for six hours, climbed the peak, and wiped out all 500 bandits. When Zengjia Township, Third District of Ba County, was attacked by bandits on April 3rd, Han Shucheng, captain of our work team, and instructor Feng Likai led more than 20 working personnel and persisted in fighting for 27 hours, finally repelling several charges by the bandits and killing and wounding 11 bandits; four of us were gloriously wounded. Others, such as Han Qidi, district head of the Fourth District of Tongliang, and all the cadres of the Sixth District, created examples of sticking to their positions.

In the military suppression, political offensives were also combined. The troops formed armed propaganda teams, fighting on one hand and carrying out propaganda on the other. Various counties and districts universally convened various meetings through representatives from all walks of life, bao and jia heads, bao people, and bandit family members, to explain policies, conduct future education, and absorb influential people to form bandit suppression committees, mobilizing people from all walks of life to persuade their neighbors and relatives who were bandits to repent and reform. Those bandits who had repented and reformed were given short-term training and then used to win over and disintegrate the bandits in order to "offset their crimes with meritorious service." The number of bandits who were won over and disintegrated and who surrendered in awe of our army's might increased day by day throughout the region.

At the same time, because the bandit suppression troops implemented a policy of abiding by discipline and loving the people and protecting the vital interests of the masses, the vast number of farmers gradually moved from watching and fearing to being conscious, and they reported bandit information, led the way, and even asked to arm themselves to protect their homes and prevent bandits. For example, in Tongliang County, eastern Sichuan, under the slogan of "holding a gun in one hand and a hoe in the other" and "suppressing bandits on one hand and producing on the other," thousands of peasant armed forces were organized, using the method of producing during the day and guarding at night, and inter-village joint defense, to maintain rural security, cover the masses' production, and successfully complete the plowing work in most areas. In Linshui County, most of the 460 bao established grain protection teams, and some of the bao's farmers have been armed to actively suppress bandits and protect public grain, so that the public grain entering the warehouse has not suffered serious losses. Luo Wencai, a Miao ethnic from Jiancao Township, Xuyong County, southern Sichuan, organized dozens of Miao people to arm themselves to prevent bandits and protect their homes, preventing the bandits from invading. Farmers have also made great contributions to the struggle against bandits. They not only assisted the troops in suppressing bandits by providing grain and labor, but even sacrificed their lives. For example, Xu Xuanxiao, a squad leader of the Tongliang peasant armed forces, led the peasant armed forces through six battles, killing and wounding four bandits, and shed his last drop of blood for the people in the battle of Liu's Courtyard. These heroic and moving deeds have not only spread among the people and sown the seeds of revolution everywhere, but also in the bloody struggle, the people of the Southwest have truly realized that the People's Liberation Army is their own army. "With you here, we have something to rely on," has become the common voice of the people. Let the American Chiang Kai-shek bandits dream of a "mainland guerrilla war" in a corner of the world!

However, the Southwest army and people did not underestimate the activities of scattered bandits because they had eliminated large groups of bandits. They will continue to wipe out scattered bandits and hidden bandits and special agents, especially in the border mountainous areas and the Yunnan and Guizhou areas close to the national border, where bandits and special agents still stir from time to time and must be completely wiped out, and fight to the end to establish a solid national defense and open up the road to rural reform!

　　开辟了农村改革的道路
    ——记西南军民剿匪的胜利
    挺进大西南的解放大军，在打垮了蒋匪帮发动卖国内战的大陆上最后的基地后，又英勇地投入极其艰苦的剿匪斗争。从去年十二月到今年九月末旬止十个月来，在军民协力进剿下，已消灭土匪达四十万人。交通线上及富庶的腹心地区已经净化，农村秩序已经安定，城乡交通开始恢复，为今后实行农村改革开辟了道路。
    剿匪反特原是新解放区打开工作局面的第一步，西南因为是大陆上最后解放的地区，蒋匪帮残余曾依托封建力量，大量转化为土匪，在西南作最后的挣扎；所以剿匪任务在西南是很艰巨的。针对这一情况，中共中央西南局曾在西南战役结束的时候，便提醒全体干部：“真正的战争还在后面”，要求大家从思想上组织上作充分准备。西南军区则号召全军继续发扬既往之顽强精神，全面展开剿匪工作，坚决消灭与人民为敌的土匪。
    在西南大进军转入结束的时候，这些一度分散隐蔽等待时机的匪特武装，从二月底以后，即逐渐由混乱分散状态走向有组织的集结，在各地城镇特别是在乡村，普遍展开破坏抢劫的罪恶活动。三、四月是西南匪情较为严重的时候，其活动的最显著特点，是带有极明显的政治目的。西南军区司令员贺龙将军曾以他所见所闻的事例，作了这样一个生动的说明：西南土匪之多，是过去多年来封建割据和国民党反动统治遗留下的罪恶。如人人皆知的，四川不少反动军阀就是依附着地主势力和土匪起家的，他们就是土匪的头子，和土匪拜把子结兄弟的很多；就连军队也是“三三制”组合的：正规军、土匪、袍哥各占三分之一。其设立的陆军大学、中学、小学都是造就土匪的学校。至于乡村封建力量，因战争发展迅速，均原封未动，如乡保武装便是地主势力直接压榨人民的爪牙。因之，人民对他们的仇恨最深，解放前在民间就流传着这样的谚语：“乡长万福侯，保长肥溜溜，甲长保乡狗，老百姓眼泪流！”但豺狼成性的蒋匪帮犹嫌老百姓的眼泪没流干，更施以特务统治，制造暴乱。所以，远在西南解放以前，蒋匪毛人凤、王陵基狗辈，即在成都招集恶霸惯匪等举办了五期“游击干部训练班”，先后训练所谓“游击干部”达五千余人，“复兴”、“ＣＣ”……多至有十七种。他们在成都都领了美造枪炮子弹。解放以后，这些匪特分子趁我大军忙于处理战后事宜的空隙，又在美英帝国主义支持下，在西南国境线及国内山地要点竖起所谓“边区游击队”、“人民反共救国军”等反动旗帜，结合封建势力，地痞流氓、惯匪及逃散的正规匪军，一度到达四十余万人之多。这些匪徒们，于三月间即在各地普遍展开所谓“西南大陆游击战”，杀人放火，破坏生产，抢掠仓库，拦路行劫，刺杀工作人员，使水陆交通没有足够的兵力掩护都难以通行。这不仅造成社会秩序不安，影响建政、生产工作的进行，而且使干部群众遭受了不少的损失。较大者如：川西匪特于二月六日，聚集匪徒两千余人，于成都以东龙潭寺、石板滩地区叛乱，杀害我师政治主任以下六十人；贵州独山县绅耆——民主人士莫凤楼，因坚拒附匪，于五月初全家四十三口人均惨遭匪特杀戮一光。川东巴县各界代表会特邀代表陈某，也是因拒绝附匪，全家殉难。甚至强迫每甲抽一人一枪，胁迫人民参加土匪，不从者即以杀人烧房相威胁。农民受害者为数很多；并制造各种谣言，以煽惑人心。这一切都说明西南的剿匪工作，本质上是一个肃清美帝走狗——蒋匪残余势力和反封建的斗争。
    但在解放初期，由于不少工作人员（甚至一般群众）对这一斗争的严重性估计不足，不仅遭到某些不必要的损失，并且放松了对首恶的镇压，曾引起了人民大众的不满。但为时不久，各地即迅速纠正了这一偏向，正确地执行了毛主席所指示的：“首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖”的镇压与宽大相结合的方针，及依靠群众、组织群众，与生产保家相结合的群众路线，而取得剿匪的基本胜利。
    首先对于那些执迷不悟坚决与人民为敌的匪特武装，则给予坚决的消灭。在剿匪斗争中，高级干部以身作则亲上前线与部队一起作战，而一般指战员和地方工作干部，在研究了对匪特的战术后，亦表现了高度的英勇与机智，他们在艰险的情况下，坚持了工作岗位，坚决的打击了匪特的活动，减少了群众的损失。这里只举几个例子看：成都起义的原国民党军三○二师，在绵竹杀害我军事代表后，即叛变逃入西山，大肆抢掠；但在我军长途尾追下，经一天攻击，即将叛匪全部消灭。川东涪陵分区某部，有一次攀山越岭追击土匪，追了三昼夜，把土匪包围在一个高山岩上，虽然战士两天没吃饭了，但战士们为了消灭面前的这股土匪，终以六小时猛烈攻击，登上峰岩，把五百土匪全部消灭了。巴县三区曾家乡于四月三日遭匪袭击时，我工作队队长韩书城、指导员冯立开，率领二十余工作人员，坚持战斗达二十七小时，终于打退土匪数次冲锋，毙伤匪十一人；我亦有四人光荣负伤。其他如铜梁四区区长韩其弟，六区全体干部均创造了坚持阵地的范例。
    在军事进剿中，同时还结合了政治攻势。部队组成武装宣传队，一面战斗，一面宣传。各县区则普遍通过各界代表会、保甲长、保民、土匪家属等各种会议，讲解政策，进行前途教育，并吸收有威望人士组成剿匪委员会，发动各界人民劝其在匪中的乡邻亲友自新悔过。对已自新悔过的土匪，则给予短期训练后，再通过他们去争取瓦解土匪，以“将功折罪”。全区经过以上方式争取瓦解及慑于我军神威而投诚的土匪日益增加。
    同时，由于剿匪部队执行了遵纪爱民的政策，保护了群众切身的利益，使广大农民便逐渐由观望恐惧走向自觉，他们纷纷自动报告匪情、带路，甚至要求武装保家防匪。如川东铜梁县在“一手拿枪，一手拿锄”、“一面剿匪，一面生产”的口号下，组织了数千农民武装，利用白天生产，晚上警戒，乡乡联防的办法，维护了农村治安，掩护了群众生产，大部地区顺利完成了耕种工作，邻水全县四百六十个保中，有大部分保成立了护粮小组，有部分保的农民已经武装起来，积极扑灭匪特，保护公粮，使入仓公粮没有受到严重损失。川南叙永县枧槽乡苗族罗文才，组织了苗民数十人，武装防匪保家，阻止了土匪的进扰。农民对剿匪的斗争贡献也是很大的，他们不仅协助部队剿匪出了粮出了力，甚至不少献出了自己的生命。如铜梁农民武装分队长徐宣孝，率领农民武装，身经六战，先后毙伤俘匪四人，而于刘家院子战斗中为人民流尽了最后一滴血。这些可歌可泣的壮烈事迹，不仅已流传在民间，遍地撒播下革命的种籽，而且在血的斗争中，西南人民已真正认识了人民解放军是他们自己的军队。“你们在这里，我们就有了依靠”，这已成为人民共同的声音。让美蒋匪帮在海涯的一角做“大陆游击战”的梦去吧！
    但西南军民并不因消灭了大股土匪而就轻视了散匪的活动。他们将继续剿灭散匪和潜伏的匪特，特别是在边沿山区和接近国境线的云贵地带，匪特还不时蠢动，必须完全扑灭，为建立巩固的国防，和开辟农村改革的道路而战斗到底！
