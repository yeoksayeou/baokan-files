　　The People's Fighters of Poland
    ——An Introduction to the Polish People's Army

    On October 12th and 13th, 1943, the First Polish Kosciuszko Division, established in the Soviet Union, participated in its first battle at Lenino on the Soviet-German front. This battle was of great significance to the Polish people.

    The Polish First Division, named after the Polish national hero Kosciuszko, was established in May 1943. This division later developed into the Polish First Army, with 140,000 soldiers. By 1944, the Polish First Army entered Poland along with the victorious Soviet armed forces. In occupied Poland, the Polish Workers' Party had organized the National Guard and the People's Army. Although this armed force was separated from the Polish First Division by the battlefront, they were ideologically aligned.

    According to the order of the Polish Committee of National Liberation on July 21, 1944, these two armed forces were merged, and thus the Polish People's Army was born. Following the Polish First Army, the Second Army, an armored corps, and other units were successively established.

    The Polish army went through a whole year of fighting alongside the Soviet army, participating in many battles. It liberated the Polish capital Warsaw alongside the Soviet army, and took advantage of the victory to cross the Oder and Neisse rivers. The First Kosciuszko Division, the predecessor of the Polish armed forces, also participated in the final battle of the Great Patriotic War - the Battle of Berlin. At the end of the war, the Polish armed forces had 600,000 well-equipped combatants with all kinds of modern weapons, including long-range artillery, mechanized units, armored units, and air force. The great assistance of the Soviet Union played a significant role in the establishment of the Polish armed forces.

    After the war, the Polish People's Armed Forces shifted to peaceful work. They accepted new tasks, but they all kept in mind the principles gained in combat and in cooperation with the progressive Soviet army. The Supreme Command led by Marshal Rokossovsky is working tirelessly to provide every soldier with appropriate political training. This work has achieved good results. The goals of the Polish people's fighters are consistent with the goals of peace fighters. They deeply know that they must strengthen themselves to strengthen the strength of the peace front.

　　波兰的人民战士
    ——波兰人民军介绍
    一九四三年十月十二日和十三日，在苏联境内建立起来的柯斯修斯科第一波兰师在苏德前线的列宁诺第一次参加战斗。这一次战役对波兰人民具有伟大的意义。
    为了纪念波兰民族英雄柯斯修斯科而以他的名字命名的波兰第一师，是在一九四三年五月间建立起来的。这个师后来发展成为波兰第一军，拥有十四万战士。到一九四四年，波兰第一军随着胜利的苏联武装部队进入了波兰。在沦陷的波兰境内，波兰工人党已组织了国民自卫队和人民军。这一武装力量虽然与波兰第一师被战线隔开，可是它们在思想上是一致的。
    根据一九四四年七月二十一日波兰中央人民委员会的命令，这两支武装力量合并起来，这样就诞生了波兰人民军。继波兰第一军之后，第二军和一个装甲兵团和其他的部队也相继建立起来。
    波军与苏军一道经历了一整年的战斗，参加了许多次战役。它与苏军一道解放了波兰的首都华沙，乘胜强渡奥得河和尼斯河。波兰武装力量的前身第一柯斯修斯科师也参加了伟大解放战争的最后一次战役——柏林战役。在战争结束的时候，波兰武装部队拥有六十万配备精良的战斗员，他们有着各种现代化的武器。包括长射程的大炮，机械化部队，装甲部队和空军。苏联的伟大援助对波兰武装部队的建立起了重大的作用。
    战争结束后，波兰人民武装部队转入了和平工作。他们接受了新的任务，可是他们都牢记着在战斗中及与进步的苏军合作之中所获得的原则。罗科索夫斯基元帅所领导的最高统帅部正在孜孜不倦地工作，给每一个战士以适当的政治训练。这件工作得到了良好成绩。波兰的人民战士的目标，与和平战士的目标是一致的。他们深知必须使自己坚强起来，以加强和平阵线的力量。
