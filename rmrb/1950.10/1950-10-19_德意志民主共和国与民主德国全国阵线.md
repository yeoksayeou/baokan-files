　　The general election of the German Democratic Republic was held on October 15th. The result of this election is the emergence of the official Central People's Government of the German Democratic Republic, opening a new period of democratic development for the German people.

　　The establishment of the new German People's Government is the result of more than five years of historical development.

　　On May 8, 1945, the Soviet army liberated Berlin, ending Hitler's thirteen-year rule in Germany, and the German people embarked on a new era.

　　According to the Potsdam Agreement announced on August 2 of the same year by the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, the entire territory of Germany was divided into four zones of military occupation by the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. During the occupation period, Germany must be managed as a unified whole. The objectives of the occupation policy were to completely eliminate fascism and militarism, implement democratic land reform, and dissolve monopoly capital organizations in order to achieve the complete democratization of Germany.

　　However, this Potsdam Agreement, unanimously agreed upon by the major powers that formed the anti-Hitler alliance during World War II, was only resolutely implemented by the Soviet Union. The United States, Britain, and France adopted policies that completely violated the Potsdam Agreement, and their plan was to make West Germany a breeding ground for fascism and a central base for launching aggressive wars in Europe.

　　Therefore, two completely different situations emerged in the Soviet occupation zone in eastern Germany and the American, British, and French occupation zones in western Germany. On the one hand, in the 111,000 square kilometers of land, accounting for one-third of the total area of Germany, 24 million people were liberated, a people's democratic government was established, militarism was eradicated, Nazi elements were purged, land reform was completed, and the industries owned by monopoly capitalists and Nazi war criminals were nationalized. Democratic reforms have also been carried out in the cultural field. On the other hand, in the 252,000 square kilometers of land in western Germany, 69 million people were reduced to colonial slavery under American and British imperialism, and Nazi elements continued to oppress the people there.

　　After the war, the German people repeatedly hoped to rebuild a unified and democratic Germany. This wish was fully supported by the Soviet Union. At successive foreign ministers' conferences, the Soviet Union consistently advocated the early completion of a peace treaty with Germany in order to establish a Germany that was economically and politically unified. However, each time it was rejected by the United States, Britain, and France. The United States, Britain, and France also took steps to undermine the Potsdam Agreement and intensified measures to split West Germany. On June 18, 1948, the three countries unilaterally implemented a one-sided "currency reform" in West Germany, splitting the economic unity of Germany; on September 20, 1949, the three countries openly supported West German reactionary politicians in Bonn to establish a puppet "Federal Republic of Germany," creating the division of Germany.

　　The establishment of the Bonn puppet government greatly deepened the German national crisis. Therefore, the German people had to rise up for national self-salvation. The German People's Council, elected by the All-German People's Congress, announced itself as the Provisional People's Parliament at its ninth session held in Berlin on October 7th, unanimously resolving to establish the German Democratic Republic with Berlin as its capital, electing Wilhelm Pieck, Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, as President, and Otto Grotewohl as Prime Minister, and forming a provisional government.

　　The establishment of the German Democratic Republic marked the first time in history that the German people had established their own country. It was hailed by the people of all Germany and the world, and it immediately established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries. Marshal Stalin pointed out the great significance of this event in his congratulatory telegram to President Pieck and Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic, saying: "The establishment of a democratic and peace-loving German republic is a turning point in European history." "The experience of the recent war, in which the peoples of Germany and the Soviet Union bore the greatest sacrifices, shows that the peoples of these two countries possess the greatest potential in Europe to accomplish great actions of world importance. As long as the peoples of these two countries show determination to fight for peace, as hard as they did during the war, then peace in Europe can be considered guaranteed."

　　The predecessor of the Provisional People's Parliament was the People's Council elected by the Third German People's Congress. The First Congress of the German People's Congress was convened in December 1947 under the call of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. Representatives from all democratic parties, groups, factories, and churches in Germany participated, becoming the organizational form of the united front of all the German people striving for unity and a just peace.

　　The Third German People's Congress, held in May 1949, was produced by universal suffrage of the German people. The congress passed the All-German Constitution and decided to hold a general election on October 15, 1950. The congress also resolved that, in order to adapt to the new situation and expand the People's Congress movement, the National Front of Democratic Germany would be established to unite all patriots and lead the people of the whole country in their struggle against the splitting, colonial, and war policies of American and British imperialism.

　　In August of this year, the National Front of Democratic Germany held its first national congress with 3,000 people, adopted a joint election program, put forward a unified list of candidates, and called on the people of the whole country to vote for the candidates of the National Front.

　　The German national general election was held on October 15th. In this election, the German people have expressed their sincere support for the National Front of Democratic Germany. Under the leadership of the official government of the German Democratic Republic, which was produced by this election, the patriotic people of all Germany, united within the National Front, will surely achieve greater success in the cause of German democratic unity.

### 德意志民主共和国与民主德国全国阵线

　　德意志民主共和国与民主德国全国阵线
    德意志民主共和国的普选已于十月十五日举行。这次选举的结果，产生德意志民主共和国的正式的中央人民政府，开辟了德国人民民主发展的新时期。
    新的德国人民政府的成立，是五年多以来历史发展的结果。
    一九四五年五月八日，苏军解放柏林，结束了希特勒在德国十三年的统治，德国人民从此走上了一个新纪元。
    按照苏、美、英三国在同年八月二日宣布的波茨坦协定，德国全境分由苏、美、英、法四国实行军事占领。在占领期内，德国必须当作一个统一的整体来管理。占领政策的目标是：彻底消灭法西斯主义与军国主义，实行民主的土地改革，解散独占资本组织，以实现德国的彻底民主化。
    但是，这个为第二次世界大战中组成反希特勒同盟的各大国所一致同意的波茨坦协定，却只有苏联一国坚决执行。美、英、法三国采取了完全与波茨坦协定违反的政策，它们的计划是要使西德成为法西斯的温床，使之成为在欧洲发动侵略战争的中心基地。
    因此，在德国东部的苏联占领区与德国西部的美、英、法占领区出现了两种截然不同的情况，一方面，在占全德面积三分之一的十一万一千方公里的土地上，二千四百万人民获得了解放，建立了人民民主政权，根除了军国主义，肃清了纳粹分子，完成了土地改革，并把独占资本家和纳粹战犯所有的工业收归人民所有，在文化方面也已进行了民主改革。而另一方面，在德国西部二十五万二千方公里的土地上，六千九百万人民却沦于美英帝国主义的殖民地奴役之下，纳粹分子依然在那里欺压人民。
    德国人民在战后一再希望能够重建统一和民主的德国。这种愿望受到苏联的充分支持。在历次外长会议上，苏联都一贯主张尽早完成对德和约，以便成立一个在经济上和政治上统一的德国。但是每一次都受到美、英、法三国的拒绝。美、英、法还一步步破坏波茨坦协定，加紧使西德分裂的措施。一九四八年六月十八日，三国擅自在西德实行了片面的“货币改革”，分裂了德国经济的统一；一九四九年九月二十日，三国更公然扶植西德反动政客在波恩成立了傀儡“德意志联邦共和国”；造成了德国的分裂。
    波恩傀儡政府的成立，使德国民族危机大大加深。因此，德国人民不能不奋起进行民族自救。由全德人民选举产生的德国人民代表大会所选出的德国人民委员会，于十月七日在柏林举行第九届会议时，即宣布自身为临时人民议会，一致决议成立以柏林为首都的德意志民主共和国，选举德国统一社会党主席皮克为总统，格罗提渥为总理，组成了临时政府。
    德意志民主共和国的成立，标志着德国人民在历史上第一次成立了自己的国家。它受到全德国和全世界人民的欢呼，它立即与苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家相继建立了外交关系。斯大林大元帅在致德意志民主共和国总统皮克、总理格罗提渥的贺电中指出了这一事件的伟大意义说：“德意志民主的、爱好和平的共和国的成立是欧洲历史的转折点。”“最近这次战争的经验表明，在这次战争中担负牺牲最大的是德国和苏联的人民，表明这两国人民在欧洲拥有最大的潜力，以完成有世界重要性的伟大行动。只要这两国人民表现决心为和平而战，像他们在战争时那样努力，那末和平在欧洲可以认为有了保证。”
    临时人民议会的前身乃是第三届德国人民代表大会所选出的人民委员会。德国人民代表大会第一届大会是一九四七年十二月在德国统一社会党号召下召开的，全德各民主党派、团体、工厂、教会均推派有代表参加，成了全德国人民争取统一和公正和平的统一战线的组织形式。
    一九四九年五月举行的第三届德国人民代表大会，是由全德人民普选产生的，会上通过了全德宪法，并决定一九五○年十月十五日举行普选。该届大会还决议：为适应新的形势，扩大人民代表大会运动，成立民主德国全国阵线，以团结一切爱国分子，领导全国人民进行斗争，反对美英帝国主义的分裂政策、殖民地政策与战争政策。
    今年八月，民主德国全国阵线举行了三千人的第一次全国代表大会，通过了共同选举纲领，提出了统一候选人名单，号召全国人民投票拥护全国阵线的候选人。
    德国全国普选已于十月十五日举行。在这次选举中，德国人民已表现衷心拥护民主德国全国阵线。团结在全国阵线内的全德爱国人民，在这次选举产生的正式的德意志民主共和国政府的领导下，必将在德国的民主统一事业方面取得更大的成绩。
