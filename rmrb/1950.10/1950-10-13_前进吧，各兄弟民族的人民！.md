　　Forward, People of All Brotherly Nationalities!
　　Inner Mongolia Cultural Troupe Baolama
　　I am a Mongolian youth. In order to celebrate the October 1st National Day, I came to Beijing, the capital of the Chinese people, and was received by the Central People's Government. This makes us endlessly grateful!
　　On National Day, we participated in the parade. When the parade passed in front of our minority ethnic delegations, they were all full of smiles and applauded warmly to welcome us. Some comrades couldn't help but come forward to shake hands and talk with us; many children were so happy when they saw us that they jumped up and shouted, "Long live the great unity of all nationalities!" Some threw the flowers and hats in their hands into the air to show their welcome. Many combat heroes and labor model representatives came to visit us and exchanged signatures with each other.
　　Seeing today's victory, I can't help but recall the past.
　　In the past many years, our Mongolian people suffered cruel oppression from the Manchu government, the Northern Warlords, the Kuomintang reactionaries and other Han chauvinists, and Japanese imperialism. These demons broke into our homeland – the free grasslands! They took away our happiness! Just as our songs sing: "Cattle and sheep are driven away, people are taken away as laborers, fertile pastures are forcibly occupied, they rape, kill and burn, stop at nothing! From that time on, the heroic people were forced to the mountains, and our homeland was ravaged into a desolate wilderness!" Recalling those years would sadden even the most cold-hearted person! These demons – the reactionary ruling class – invaded us for their own benefit; in order to fight for power and profit, they launched countless inter-ethnic conflicts, turning the people into the victims of predatory wars!
　　Today, the great Chinese People's Revolution has won a basic victory, and the last tyrant who ruled the Chinese people – the Chiang family dynasty – has been overthrown! The great New China was born! With the birth of New China, the people of our minority nationalities have obtained a glorious, happy, free, and new life! With the birth of New China, a relationship of unity and friendship has been established between our fraternal nationalities.
　　Today, the tragedy of thousands of years has ended, and a new people's century has begun!
　　This new century tells me a truth: Only by always following the Communist Party, always following Chairman Mao, can we move from victory to victory!
　　Forward! People of all brotherly nationalities, under the banner of Mao Zedong, let us join hands to build our happy paradise – an independent and prosperous New China.

　　前进吧，各兄弟民族的人民！
    内蒙文工团  包拉吗
    我是一个蒙古青年。为了庆祝十月一日国庆节，我来到了中国人民的首都北京，受了中央人民政府的招待。这是使我们感激不尽的！
    在国庆日，我们参加了检阅。游行队伍走到了我们少数民族代表团前面时，都是满面笑容，并热烈鼓掌，表示欢迎我们。有些同志见了我们都情不自禁地到我们前面来和我们握手、谈话；很多小朋友们看见了咱们，都高兴得跳起来了，高喊：“各民族大团结万岁！”有的把手中的鲜花和帽子抛向空中表示欢迎咱们。很多战斗英雄、劳动模范代表们来访问咱们，互相交换签字。
    看见了胜利的今天，我不禁回忆起过去的生活。
    在过去多少年来，我们蒙古民族受到了满清政府、北洋军阀、国民党反动派等大汉族主义者及日本帝国主义的残酷压迫。这些恶魔闯进了我们的家乡——自由的草原！他们夺去了我们的幸福！正如我们的歌声里所唱的一样：“牛羊被人赶去，人当劳工拉走，丰美的水草被强占，他们奸淫烧杀，无所不为！从那时，英雄的民族人民被逼上山头，我们的家乡被蹂躏得变成一片凄凉的荒原！”回想起这些年代，就是铁石心肠的人也要心酸啊！这些恶魔——反动的统治阶级，为了他们的利益，向我们进行侵略；为了争权夺利，发动了无数次民族间的冲突，把人民当成了掠夺战争的牺牲品！
    今天，伟大的中国人民大革命获得了基本上的胜利，最后一个统治中国人民的暴君——蒋家朝廷被打倒！伟大的新中国诞生了！随着新中国的诞生，咱们少数民族的人民得到了光辉、愉快、幸福、自由的新生活！随着新中国的诞生，咱们各兄弟民族之间建立了团结、友爱的民族关系。
    今天，几千年来的悲剧结束了，一个新的人民的世纪开始了！
    这个新的世纪，告诉了我一个真理：只有永远跟着共产党，永远跟着毛主席，才会由胜利走向胜利！
    前进吧！各兄弟民族的人民，在毛泽东的旗帜下携起手来，共同建设我们的幸福的乐园——独立、富强的新中国。
