Xinhua News Agency, New York, 20th - According to TASS dispatches: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, after three days of meetings since the 16th, concluded on October 18th the paragraph-by-paragraph discussion of the "United Action for Peace" proposal submitted by the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Turkey, the Philippines, France, and Uruguay.

On October 17th, at the beginning of the committee meeting, the discussion of section A of the Seven-Nation Proposal continued.

The Byelorussian representative, Kiselev, pointed out in his speech that the provisions in this section that a decision by any seven members of the Security Council could convene a special session of the General Assembly, and that the General Assembly could make recommendations on taking action, were in complete violation of the United Nations Charter. Kiselev also opposed the provision in this section that a special session could be convened within 24 hours after the notice was issued. He pointed out that in such a short period of time, delegations from various countries could not prepare for the meeting, and some could not even arrive in New York in time. Such hasty action would undoubtedly affect the interests of the member states of the United Nations.

The representatives of Iraq and India expressed doubts about the legality of the sections regarding the convening of a special session of the General Assembly based on the decision of any seven members of the Security Council, and the General Assembly making recommendations on taking action.

After the meeting on the 17th concluded the discussion of section A, it was decided to postpone the vote on section A and immediately discuss section B of the Seven-Nation Proposal. This section stipulates the establishment of a "Peace Observation Group" composed of nine to fourteen member states of the United Nations to investigate and report on the situation in any region with international tensions; stipulates that the Peace Observation Group shall be used by the United Nations General Assembly or the General Assembly's "Interim Committee" (i.e., the illegal so-called "Little General Assembly"), and stipulates that the General Assembly's "Interim Committee" has the right to appoint the so-called "Observer Group," illegally established under the manipulation of the United States before the General Assembly, to assist the Peace Observation Group.

The Soviet representative, Vyshinsky, pointed out in his speech that the Peace Observation Group must be truly representative in order to play an active role. To be representative, it must include the five permanent members of the Security Council. Therefore, the composition of the Peace Observation Group should be clearly stipulated to be composed of nine to fourteen member states, including the five permanent members of the Security Council. Vyshinsky also pointed out that the so-called "Interim Committee" is illegal, it cannot play any role, it is just a corpse. Therefore, the provision in the proposal authorizing the "Interim Committee" to use the Peace Observation Group should be canceled. The provision for using the so-called "Observer Group" is also illegal and should be deleted.

The Polish representative, Wierblowski, supported the Soviet Union's amendments.

The Syrian representative supported the proposition that the Peace Observation Group should include the five permanent members of the Security Council. The representative of the Union of South Africa also suggested canceling the provision that the "Interim Committee" could use the Peace Observation Group.

However, the proposing countries of the Seven-Nation Proposal declared that they refused to accept the Soviet Union's amendments.

The meeting on the 17th then discussed section C of the Seven-Nation Proposal, and the discussion of this section was not concluded until the 18th. Section C of the Seven-Nation Proposal stipulates that the United Nations and its member states should earmark a portion of their troops to be ready to form a United Nations army at any time in response to the "recommendations" of the General Assembly; and stipulates that the Secretary-General of the United Nations shall appoint a "group of military experts" to provide advice on the organization, armament, and training of such troops.

The Soviet representative, Vyshinsky, pointed out in his speech that the provision for organizing the United Nations army in this way is in complete violation of the United Nations Charter, because the Charter clearly stipulates that the United Nations forces should be organized by the Security Council based on special agreements concluded between member states, and should be controlled by the Security Council. The section on the appointment of a "group of military experts" by the Secretary-General of the United Nations also clearly violates the clause in the Charter establishing a Military Staff Committee under the Security Council. Vyshinsky asked the Political Committee to reject this section, which grossly violates the United Nations Charter. At the same time, Vyshinsky urged the Political Committee to adopt the Soviet Union's amendment, which requires the five permanent members of the Security Council to consult with each other in accordance with the Charter in order to reach an agreement on joint action to maintain peace and security.

Representatives from Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Byelorussia spoke in support of the Soviet Union's position. The Philippines, Turkey, and Greece made sophistry for the Seven-Nation Proposal.

After concluding the discussion of section C at the meeting on the 18th, section D of the Seven-Nation Proposal was discussed. This section stipulates the establishment of a "Collective Action Committee" composed of ten to fourteen member states of the United Nations to study ways to maintain and strengthen international security, including the use of armed forces, and to report to the General Assembly.

The Soviet representative, Vyshinsky, declared that this section was unacceptable. He pointed out that the powers of the proposed "Collective Action Committee" overlap with those of the Security Council and the Military Staff Committee, which exercise their powers according to the powers granted to them by the Charter, while the "Collective Action Committee" is only based on a proposal that violates the Charter.

Representatives from Ukraine, Poland, and Czechoslovakia also advocated the abolition of the illegal section D of the Seven-Nation Proposal.

After discussing section E of the Seven-Nation Proposal, which stipulates that member states of the United Nations should cooperate with the United Nations and actively participate in joint action, and the preamble to the Seven-Nation Proposal, the meeting on the 18th concluded the paragraph-by-paragraph discussion of the Seven-Nation Proposal and began to vote on the Seven-Nation Proposal paragraph by paragraph.

The Soviet Union's amendment to section A, which stipulates the convening of a special session of the General Assembly, was first put to a vote and was not passed. The original section A was passed by the US-British majority (the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted against).

Before voting on section B, which stipulates the establishment of a Peace Observation Group, the Soviet representative, Vyshinsky, proposed that the organizational composition of the Peace Observation Group should be determined in the Political Committee meeting before the General Assembly discusses it. This proposal was accepted by the Political Committee. The Soviet Union's amendment to cancel the provision in section B regarding authorizing the "Interim Committee" to use the Peace Observation Group was defeated in a vote with 44 votes against, 8 votes in favor (including the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, etc.), and 8 abstentions (including India, Indonesia, Yemen, etc.). Another amendment proposed by the Soviet Union to cancel the provision for using the so-called "Observer Group" was also defeated. Then section B of the Seven-Nation Proposal was passed by the US-British bloc majority.

Afterwards, the meeting voted on the Soviet Union's amendment to delete section C, which stipulates the establishment of a United Nations army. Five countries voted in favor (the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia), 47 countries voted against, and 6 countries abstained (including India, Indonesia, Yemen, Syria, and other countries). Section C of the Seven-Nation Proposal was then passed by a majority.

The meeting then voted on the Soviet Union's amendment to delete section D, which stipulates the establishment of a "Collective Action Committee," and was rejected by 46 votes against by the US-British bloc. The Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted in favor, and six countries abstained. The US-British mechanical majority then passed section D of the Seven-Nation Proposal.

Section E of the Seven-Nation Proposal was passed by a majority of 58 votes in favor, with two abstentions.

The Soviet Union's amendment to the preamble of the Seven-Nation Proposal was rejected by the US-British majority. The original preamble was then passed by a mechanical majority, with the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voting against, and Yemen abstaining.

After the voting on each section of the Seven-Nation Proposal was completed, the committee decided to vote on the entire proposal after electing the Peace Observation Group and the "Collective Action Committee."

    联大政委会讨论并表决“七国提案”
    美英集团操纵多数竟予通过
    悍然不顾苏联所提合乎宪章的修正案
    【新华社二十日讯】综合塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会自十六日起经三日会议后，已于十月十八日结束对美、加、英、土、菲、法、乌（拉圭）等七国所提“保障和平的联合行动”案的逐段讨论。
    十月十七日委员会会议开始时继续讨论七国提案的甲段。
    白俄罗斯代表基塞列夫发言中指出：该段规定安理会任何七理事国的决定即可召开大会特别会议，以及大会可就采取行动方面提出建议两点都是完全违反联合国宪章的。基塞列夫并反对该段中规定通知发出后二十四小时内即可召开特别会议的一点，他指出：这样短的时间内，各国代表团不能对会议有所准备，甚至连赶到纽约的时间都没有。这样仓促从事无疑会影响联合国各会员国的利益。
    伊拉克代表及印度代表分别对根据安理会任何七理事国的决定即可召开大会特别会议以及大会可就采取行动方面提出建议二节是否合法，表示怀疑。
    十七日会议结束对甲段的讨论后，决定延期表决甲段而即行讨论七国提案的乙段。该段规定成立由九至十四个联合国会员国组成“和平观察团”，考察任何存在紧张国际局势地区的情况并提出报告；规定和平观察团由联合国大会或大会“临时委员会”（即非法的所谓“小型联大”）使用，规定大会“临时委员会”有权任命大会前在美国操纵下非法成立的所谓“观察员小组”协助和平观察团工作。
    苏联代表维辛斯基发言指出：和平观察团必须真正具有代表性，才能起积极作用。而要具有代表性，就必须包括安理会五常任理事国在内。因此和平观察团的成分应明确规定由包括安理会五常任理事国在内的九至十四个会员国组成。维辛斯基又指出：所谓“临时委员会”是非法的，它什么作用也起不了，只是一具僵尸。因此，提案中授权“临时委员会”使用和平观察团的规定，应予取消。利用所谓“观察员小组”的规定也是非法的，应予删除。
    波兰代表威尔勃洛夫斯基支持苏联的修正意见。
    叙利亚代表支持和平观察团应包括安理会五常任理事国在内的主张。南非联邦代表也建议取消“临时委员会”可使用和平观察团的规定。
    但是，七国提案的提案国声明拒绝接受苏联的修正意见。
    十七日会议继即讨论七国提案的丙段，该段的讨论延至十八日才结束。七国提案丙段规定联合国与各会员国应划出一部分军队，随时准备应大会的“建议”而组成联合国军队；并规定由联合国秘书长任命“军事专家小组”，对组织、武装与训练这种军队的问题提供意见。
    苏联代表维辛斯基发言指出：这样来组织联合国军队的规定，完全违反联合国宪章，因为宪章明确规定联合国部队应由安全理事会根据会员国间缔结的特别协定组织，并应由安全理事会支配。由联合国秘书长任命“军事专家小组”一节，也明白地触犯了宪章中在安理会下设立军事参谋团的条款。维辛斯基要求政治委员会否决粗暴破坏联合国宪章的这一段。同时，维辛斯基敦促政治委员会通过苏联的修正案，即根据宪章要求安理会五常任理事国进行商谈，以就维持和平与安全的联合行动获致协议。
    波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、白俄罗斯代表发言支持苏联的立场。而菲律宾、土耳其及希腊则为七国提案进行诡辩。
    十八日会议在结束对丙段的讨论后，即讨论七国提案的丁段。该段规定设立由联合国十至十四个会员国组成的“集体行动委员会”，研究维持和加强国际安全的办法，包括使用军队的办法在内，并向大会提出报告。
    苏联代表维辛斯基宣称这一段是不能接受的。他指出拟议中的“集体行动委员会”的职权与安全理事会及军事参谋团的职权重复，安全理事会及军事参谋团是根据宪章所赋予它们的权力来行使职权的，“集体行动委员会”却只是根据破坏宪章的提案。
    乌克兰、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克代表同样主张撤消非法的七国提案丁段。
    十八日会议在讨论七国提案规定建议联合国各会员国与联合国合作积极参加联合行动的戊段，以及七国提案的序言以后，即结束对七国提案的逐段讨论，而开始逐段表决七国提案。
    苏联的对规定召开大会特别会议的甲段所提出的修正案首先付诸表决，未获通过。而原提案甲段则为美英多数所通过（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、和捷克斯洛伐克投票反对）。
    在表决规定成立和平观察团的乙段以前，苏联代表维辛斯基提议：和平观察团的组织成分应在大会尚未讨论以前在政治委员会会议中确定。这个提议为政治委员会所接受。苏联所提取消乙段中关于授权“临时委员会”使用和平观察团的规定的修正案在表决时有四十四票反对，八票赞成（包括苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克等国）、八票弃权（包括印度、印尼、也门等国），因而被否决。苏联所提取消利用所谓“观察员小组”的规定的另一修正案，也被否决。然后七国提案的乙段为美英集团多数所通过。
    其后，会议表决苏联所提删去规定成立联合国军队的丙段的修正案，五国投票赞成（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克），四十七国投票反对，六国弃权（包括印度、印尼、也门、叙利亚及其他国家）。七国提案的丙段随即被多数通过。
    会议接着表决苏联所提删去规定成立“集体行动委员会”的丁段的修正案，结果被美英集团四十六国投票反对所否决。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰及捷克斯洛伐克投票赞成，六国弃权。美英机械多数继即通过了七国提案的丁段。
    七国提案戊段以五十八票多数赞成而通过，二票弃权。
    苏联对七国提案序言所提的修正案为美英多数所否决。而原序言则为机械多数所通过、苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰及捷克斯洛伐克五国投票反对，也门一国弃权。
    在七国提案各段表决完毕后，委员会决定在选举和平观察团及“集体行动委员会”以后，再表决整个提案。
