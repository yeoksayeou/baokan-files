　　Tianjin No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 Power Plants All Staff
    Report Production Competition Achievements to Chairman Mao
    Exceeding Production Tasks as a National Day Gift and Guaranteeing Completion and Surpassing This Year's Fourth Quarter Tasks
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] On the eve of National Day, all the staff of the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau's No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 power plants wrote a letter to Chairman Mao to report the results of the production competition. The original letter is as follows: Dear Chairman Mao:
    The birth of New China has been a year, and under your wise leadership, there has been great progress throughout the country. We would like to extend our highest respect to you.
    In order to welcome National Day, we launched a competition to eliminate accidents and ensure the overfulfillment of production tasks. Now we respectfully report the results of the production competition to you as a gift for National Day. Since the competition started on September 14, we have not stopped electricity for a second. As of September 28, both coal consumption and plant use rate have been reduced and exceeded the quota. Coal consumption exceeded: No. 2 plant by 7.7%, No. 3 plant by 3.3%, and No. 4 plant by 8.9%. Plant use rate exceeded: No. 2 plant by 13.7%, No. 3 plant by 6.3%, and No. 4 plant by 5.7%.
    We keep in mind the instructions you gave: "Unite as one, work hard, and strive to complete the country's tasks and improve our own lives." We guarantee that in the fourth quarter of this year, we will use our labor to complete and exceed the tasks given by the country even more.
    We wish you eternal good health!
    Respectfully, All Staff of Tianjin Electric Power Bureau No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 Power Plants
    September 30, 1950
