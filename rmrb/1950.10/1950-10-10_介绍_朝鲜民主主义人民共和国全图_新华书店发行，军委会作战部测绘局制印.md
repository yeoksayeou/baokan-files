　　Introducing the "Complete Map of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea"
    Published by Xinhua Bookstore, Printed by the Mapping Bureau of the Military Commission's Operations Department

    The "Complete Map of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" is a double-spread, large-format, sixty-pound coated paper, five-color map. It is the most accurate and detailed Korean map published in various locations since the American imperialists launched their war of aggression in Korea on June 23rd. It is reduced from the newest and most detailed 1:50,000 maps. Important transportation hubs and towns above the township level are drawn on this map, and the boundaries of each province and its borders with neighboring countries are particularly clear. Of particular importance is that this map meticulously depicts various transportation routes in Korea, making it easy for readers to consult. The map also includes street maps of Pyongyang and Seoul.

    Here, I want to mention the "New Map of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" published by the Shanghai Da Zhongguo Book Bureau and Ya Guang & Di Xue She more than a month ago. This map has many errors: (1) It depicts Tsushima Island as belonging to Korea; (2) Provincial boundaries are printed incorrectly (such as the boundary between Gangwon Province and South Hamgyong Province); (3) It lacks the newly established Jagang Province; (4) Ulleungdo is not drawn in; (5) Important railway transportation lines are not drawn in (such as the railway from Seoul to Chuncheon, and the railway from Seoul via Wonju, Andong to Yeongcheon). These errors also exist in the "Map of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" published by World Knowledge Press. I hope Ya Guang & Di Xue She and World Knowledge Press will correct these errors as soon as possible.

### 介绍“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国全图”  新华书店发行，军委会作战部测绘局制印

　　介绍“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国全图”
    新华书店发行，军委会作战部测绘局制印
    “朝鲜民主主义人民共和国全图”，是一张对开大孝六十磅道林纸五色套印的地图，是自六月二十三日美帝在朝鲜发动侵略战争以来各地所出版的朝鲜地图中最正确而详细的一种。它是根据最新而且最详细的地图五万分之一的地图缩制而成的，重要的交通站和面以上的市镇在这张地图上都经绘入，而各道的道界及其与邻国的国界也特别分明。尤其重要的，是这张地图上能将朝鲜各种交通路线细密绘入，使读者易于查考。图中并附印了平壤市街图和汉城城市图。
    在此，我要提一提在一个多月以前上海大中国图书局发行、亚光与地学社所出版的“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国新地图”。这张地图错误很多：（一）将对马岛绘属朝鲜；（二）道界印错（如江原道与咸镜南道之间的道界）；（三）缺新设道慈江道；（四）郁陵岛没有绘入；（五）重要的铁路交通线没有绘入（如汉城至春川的铁道，由汉城经原州、安东至永川的铁路）。这些错误，在世界知识社出版的“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国地图”中也同样存在。希望亚光舆地学社及世界知识社早日更正。
