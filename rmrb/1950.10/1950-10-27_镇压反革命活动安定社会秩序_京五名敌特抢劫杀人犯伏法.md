　　Suppressing Counter-Revolutionary Activities and Stabilizing Social Order
　　Five Enemy Agents, Robbers, and Murderers Executed in Beijing
　　[This newspaper dispatch] According to news from the Beijing Municipal News Office: In order to suppress counter-revolutionary activities and stabilize social order, enemy agent Liu Xiaolin, Zhao Ruizeng, Yu Donghu, robbers and murderers Yang Yongshi, Wang Luxiang, and others, five in total, have been sentenced to death by the Military Tribunal of the Beijing Municipal Military Control Commission and were executed by firing squad on the 26th.
　　Enemy agent Liu Xiaolin, 47 years old, from Tianjin, served as the plainclothes special agent squad leader of the security section of the pseudo-police department of the Beijing East Railway Station during the period of Japanese occupation. He consistently persecuted the people, murdered Yang Niuzi and Yi Xiaomao, and arrested masses for the Japanese to be used as laborers. The whereabouts of twelve people are still unknown. The laboring people near the station suffered countless persecutions from him. The Military Tribunal sentenced him to death due to his numerous evil deeds.
　　Zhao Ruizeng, 40 years old, from Jin County, Hebei Province. Yu Donghu, 36 years old, from Shenze County, Hebei Province. Both criminals had served as Japanese puppet agents and were consistently hostile to the people. After liberation, not only did the two criminals not repent and participate in labor production, but they also conspired with Kong Fanxiang, Wang Zhimin, Liu Yupu and others to commit multiple robberies, and strangled the farmer Wang Wenhan. The Military Tribunal, considering the two criminals' crimes unforgivable, decided to sentence them to death. Accomplice Kong Fanxiang was sentenced to nine years of imprisonment, while Wang Zhimin and Liu Yupu were each sentenced to five years of imprisonment.
　　Yang Yongshi, 29 years old, from Wuqing County, Hebei Province. He opened the Jinghua Restaurant in this city. In 1949, Yang and Wang Zechang jointly operated the Ruicheng Consignment Store on Wangfujing Street. Due to disagreements, Yang withdrew his shares this March. However, because the store's business was thriving, Yang became jealous and plotted a robbery. On the night of September 21st, Yang hid a pre-purchased weapon, a hammer, and entered the store, sleeping on the carpet with Du Yutian, a cook at the store. After Du fell asleep, Yang used the hammer to knock Du unconscious, then strangled him with a rope, and subsequently opened the cabinet and stole a large amount of property. After the case was solved by our Public Security Bureau, the criminal was transferred to the Military Tribunal of the Military Control Commission for trial. The Military Tribunal sentenced the criminal to the ultimate penalty due to his premeditated robbery and murder.
　　Wang Luxiang, 30 years old, from Gu'an County, Hebei Province, masterminded multiple gang robberies and attacked our public security personnel with wooden sticks, seizing firearms. After the crime occurred, he resisted arrest. In order to consolidate revolutionary order, the Military Control Commission sentenced Wang to death. Accomplice Jia Yaotang was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment, Liu Guangyuan to eight years of imprisonment, Yao Chengyao to five years of imprisonment, Yang Yintai to three years of imprisonment, and Yin Quan to one year of imprisonment.

　　镇压反革命活动安定社会秩序
    京五名敌特抢劫杀人犯伏法
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处消息：为镇压反革命活动及安定社会秩序，敌特刘小林、赵瑞增、于东虎，抢劫杀人犯杨庸石、王禄祥等五人，已经北京市军事管制委员会军法处判处死刑，于二十六日执行枪决。
    敌特刘小林，四十七岁，天津人，在日寇统治时期充当北京东车站伪警务段保安系便衣特务班长，一贯残害人民，曾杀害杨妞子、伊小猫二人，并为日寇抓捕群众，充当劳工，至今生死不明者有十二人。车站附近劳动人民受其迫害者，难以数计，军法处以其作恶多端，特判处死刑。
    赵瑞增，四十岁，河北晋县人。于东虎，三十六岁，河北深泽县人。二犯均曾当过日伪特务，一贯与人民为敌。解放后，二犯非但不知悔改参加劳动生产，且伙同孔繁祥、王志民、刘玉璞等人多次主谋行劫，并勒死农民王文汉，军法处因二犯罪不可赦，决定判处死刑。从犯孔繁祥处徒刑九年，王志民、刘玉璞各判处徒刑五年。
    杨庸石，二十九岁，河北省武清县人。在本市开设京华食堂，杨犯于一九四九年与王泽长伙同经营王府井大街瑞成委托商行，因彼此不和，杨犯遂于本年三月自动撤股。但因该商行营业发达，杨犯心怀嫉恨，蓄意行劫。九月二十一日夜，杨犯藏带预先购置的凶器铁锤等，进入该行，与该行厨工杜玉田同睡于地毡上。俟杜睡熟即用铁锤将杜击昏，然后用绳勒毙，随即开柜抢去大批财物。此案为我公安局破获后，即将该犯移送军管会军法处审理，军法处以该犯预谋行抢杀人，遂处以极刑。
    王禄祥，三十岁，河北省固安县人，主谋结伙抢劫多次，并用木棍袭击我公安人员，夺取枪枝。案发后并对抗拒捕，军管会为巩固革命秩序，特判处王犯死刑。从犯贾耀堂判处徒刑十五年，刘广元处徒刑八年，姚承尧处徒刑五年，杨荫泰处徒刑三年，尹全处徒刑一年。
