　　How to Conduct Current Affairs Propaganda Among Workers
　　Wang Ping
　　Current affairs and political education has become one of today's central tasks. In today's fight against the expansion of aggression by U.S. imperialism, consolidating and unleashing the production enthusiasm of all workers is a prerequisite for current affairs and political education.
　　Zhao Guoyou and Nie Bingju, advanced producers who usually take the lead, also play a leading role in the current affairs and political education of the Northeast Machine Factory No. 3. They are known among the workers as "knowledgeable and well-informed," and the workers believe everything they say; when they encounter any difficulties, they automatically go to Lao Zhao and Lao Nie to "get the bottom line." They have always been relatively concerned about current affairs, and Lao Zhao keeps the day's newspaper on his lathe every day. Workers read it whenever they have a spare moment and talk about it. They also have a relatively good understanding of the workers' thoughts and feelings, and they always "hit the mark" when they talk. Therefore, using these advanced producers to carry out current affairs and political education is one of the best methods.
　　The methods they use to conduct current affairs and political education among workers can be summarized in eight words: "vivid, specific, dynamic, and flexible."
　　Zhao Guoyou heard the workers talking about "paper tigers." They said: "A paper tiger can be pierced with one finger. Is the old U.S. really that weak?" "If it's a paper tiger, why not just knock him down?" Zhao Guoyou started with the paper tiger and conducted current affairs and political education among the workers. His method was to use clear and simple comparisons. First, he explained that the U.S. imperialists' army, navy, and air force combined only amounted to 1.4 million; our People's Liberation Army is 5 million; and how many millions are there in the Soviet Union's big brother's army? He also explained that there are strikes everywhere in the United States; we are having production competitions every day; and the enthusiasm in Soviet factories is "I saw it with my own eyes, it's even more vigorous than ours!" The typical reports he heard at the National Combat Heroes Representatives Conference also became the best material for him to explain in current affairs and political education that "reactionaries cannot withstand a beating." When he saw that the workers were all listening in a daze, he concluded: "So saying 'paper tiger' is not about the words themselves, but about looking at the essence. That is to say, the old U.S. is far behind our people's strength, and he cannot withstand the people's beating." The workers all nodded in agreement.
　　Then, Zhao Guoyou used the comparison between the old and new life to explain the importance of defending peace: "Whoever wants to eat bean cakes, whoever wants to be an 'economic criminal' or a 'national affairs criminal,' whoever is waiting for U.S. imperialism to rule, let them wait; if we want to be masters, if we want to live in high-rise workers' dormitories, and if people with poor health want to live in night sanatoriums (note: workers' dormitories and night sanatoriums were recently built by the Northeast Machine Factory No. 3), we must resist the old U.S., and we must work harder at the lathe. The old U.S. says his machines are good, and our machines must beat his machines."
　　Zhao Guoyou's propaganda is very dynamic and flexible. At lunchtime in the factory, the people around him are his propaganda targets. One day he saw several female apprentices pasting windows, and they pasted an airplane on the window. Lao Zhao said: "This thing is quite beautiful. Are you afraid of airplanes?" and he began to conduct current affairs propaganda. On the 18th, he moved from his home to live in the factory. Some workers saw him carrying his bedding roll into the factory gate and asked: "Lao Zhao, why are you moving into the factory?" Lao Zhao replied with a smile: "It's because of this that I moved into the factory. Let the old U.S. know that the more rampant he is, the more energetic our production will be. The relationship between our workers and the factory cannot be broken by guns or bombed by cannons."
　　Zhao Guoyou also used his position as deputy secretary of the Youth League General Branch to specifically help the Youth League group leaders: "You help other Youth League members, so that every Youth League member becomes a very good propagandist—propagandize when you are moving things with the master craftsman, propagandize to your relatives and friends, and propagandize whenever you have a chance."
　　Nie Bingju also loves to use the method of comparison to explain the strength of the enemy and ourselves. One of his characteristics is to go deep into the worker masses and patiently conduct propaganda. Every day after dinner, he wanders into the workers' dormitory. The workers are just setting up tables on the heated platform to drink "after-dinner tea," which is the time for casual chats. He jumps onto the heated platform and starts chatting. Sometimes he starts with major world events, sometimes he starts with a news item in the newspaper, sometimes he starts with rice, grain, and vegetables… The bottom line is to explain that U.S. imperialism does not want us to live a good life, we must step up production, prevent traitors and spies, and do our best to oppose it and protect our peaceful and happy life.
　　Sometimes he speaks to each household, and sometimes he discovers that a certain worker has a confused understanding of the current situation, and he specifically goes to his home several times to chat. He not only conducts education, but also understands the situation.
　　Zhao Guoyou and Nie Bingju both believe that the workers of Machine Factory No. 3 already have a certain degree of political awareness, and their production enthusiasm is already quite high. The current problem is to continue to improve their level of awareness in order to consolidate their labor enthusiasm and unleash their labor wisdom. The important method is to conduct current affairs and political education. Zhao Guoyou asked me to introduce him to some books related to "current affairs." This spirit of "must study in order to do a good job in propaganda and education" is a good example given by advanced producers to propaganda personnel in current affairs and political education.

    怎样向工人进行时事宣传
    王坪
    时事政治教育已经成为今天的中心课题之一。在反对美帝扩大侵略的今天，巩固和发挥全体职工生产热忱，时事政治教育实是先决条件。
    平时起带头作用的先进生产者赵国有、聂秉举，在东北机器三厂的时事政治教育中，也起着带头作用。他们在工人中有“见多识广”之称，一言一语工人们都相信不疑；遇见啥疑难事，便有人自动去找老赵、老聂“讨底”。他们一向比较关心时事，老赵的车床上每天都放着当天的报纸，工人们一有空隙就顺手拿来看，顺嘴就谈论。他们也比较了解工人的思想情绪，一谈起来就正好“对门儿”。所以通过这些先进生产者来进行时事政治教育，是最好的方法之一。
    他们向工人进行时事政治教育的方法，可以用“生动、具体、机动、灵活”八个字来概括。
    赵国有听见工人们都在谈“纸老虎”。他们说：“纸老虎可以用一个手指头戳穿，大老美未必这样水（不行）？”“既是纸老虎，何不一下干垮他？”赵国有便从纸老虎说起，向工人们进行时事政治教育。他的方法是用明白浅显的对比。先说明美帝国主义的陆海空军加在一起才一百四十万；咱们人民解放军就是五百万；苏联老大哥的军队又是多少万。又说明美国国内到处在罢工；咱们这里天天在闹生产竞赛；苏联工厂里那股子热烘劲，“我是亲眼看见的，比咱们还蝎虎！”他又把他在莫斯科红场上看见苏军检阅的情形，有声有色的讲出来：“那种比声音还快的飞机，一霎眼就到了跟前！”这次在全国战斗英雄代表会议上听见的那些典型报告，也成了他作为时事政治教育中说明“反动派就是经不起打”的最好材料。看见工人们都听得发呆了时，他下结论了：“所以说‘纸老虎’不能扣名词，钻字眼，要看本质。就是说，大老美同咱们人民的力量比起来他差得太多，他经不起人民的打。”工人们便都一个个点头称是。
    接着赵国有就用新旧生活的对比来说明保卫和平的重要：“谁要想吃豆饼，谁要想当‘经济犯’、‘国事犯’，谁就等着美帝国主义来统治吧；咱们要想当主人，要想住高楼大厦的工人宿舍，身板不好的人要想住夜间休养所（按：工人宿舍与夜间休养所都是东北机器三厂最近修建起来的），咱们就得反抗大老美，咱们就得在车床跟前加紧干。大老美说他的机器好，咱们的机器就要打过（胜过）他的机器。”
    赵国有的宣传是很机动灵活的。在厂里吃晌午饭，周围的人便是他的宣传对象。一天他看见几个女徒工在糊窗子，在窗上贴了架飞机，老赵说：“这玩意儿倒怪美的。你们怕不怕飞机？”便进行起时事宣传来。十八日他从家里搬到厂里住，有的工人看见他抗着铺盖卷儿走进厂门便问：“老赵，这么喒你怎的还搬进厂来住？”老赵笑哈哈的答复他们：“就是这么喒才搬进厂子住。叫大老美知道知道，他越猖狂，咱们的生产越有劲。咱们工人和工厂的关系，是枪打不散、炮轰不开的。”
    赵国有还用了青年团总支副书记的身份，具体帮助团小组长们：“你们再帮助其他团员，使每一个团员都成为很好的宣传员——跟老师父搬弄东西时宣传，向你的亲戚朋友宣传，看见人一有机会就宣传。”
    聂秉举也最爱用对比的方法说明敌我的力量。他的一个特点是深入工人群众，耐心进行宣传。他每天吃了晚饭，便遛到工人宿舍中。工人们正好在炕上摆着桌子喝“饭后茶”，正是闲聊天的时候。他往炕上一蹬，便唠扯开了。有时从天下大事唠起，有时从报纸上一个消息唠起，有时从米粮菜蔬唠起……归根是说明美国帝国主义不让咱们过好日子，咱们要加紧生产，防奸防特，尽自己的力量来反对它，保稳咱们和平幸福的日子。
    他有时是挨家挨户的讲，有时是发现某个工人对时局有某种糊涂认识，特别到他家去多串几次门。又进行了教育，又了解了情况。
    赵国有和聂秉举两人都认为机器三厂的工人已经有了一定的政治觉悟，生产热情也已经相当高涨，现在的问题是继续提高他们的觉悟程度，以巩固劳动热情和发挥劳动智慧。重要的方法，就是进行时事政治教育。赵国有要我介绍他一些有关“时事方面的书”。这种“必须学习才能做好宣传教育工作”的精神，是先进生产者在时事政治教育方面给宣传人员的一个良好榜样。
