　　Northeast State-Owned Industrial and Mining Enterprises
    Achieve Great Success in Production Over the Past Year
    Total Output Value More Than Four Times That of the Same Period Last Year
    [Report from Shenyang by this newspaper] Special Correspondent Hong Liang reports: The production of state-owned industry in Northeast China in the year since the founding of the nation has achieved great success due to the correct leadership of the People's Government and the hard work of all employees.
    The value of total industrial output, calculated at constant prices, accumulated to the end of August this year, exceeded that of the same period last year by 436.1 percent. The number of product items increased by 213.3 percent. Of the 30 major products, with the exception of coal (the state decided to reduce production), 29 exceeded the output of the same period last year. For example, wire exceeded 1920 percent, ammonium sulfate exceeded 845.5 percent, iron ore exceeded 671 percent, and electric furnace steel ingots exceeded 510.7 percent.
    Although quality improvement still requires great effort, considerable progress has been made. For example, before October 1st of last year, almost all machine tools were substandard, but now not only are all of them up to standard, but third-grade products have also been eliminated. Pig iron has eliminated extra-grade iron. The percentage of substandard cloth has been reduced to below 3 percent. The qualification rate of light bulbs has been raised to over 90 percent and can last for more than 2,000 hours.
    Flat glass can now be produced in large quantities, and first-class products have reached 99 percent.
    Productivity has increased significantly, and work quotas are constantly increasing. Calculated at constant value, August of this year increased by 403.4 percent compared to the end of August last year. In terms of work quotas, for example, the production quota per worker for steel ingots produced in Benxi in June of this year increased by 450 percent compared to August of last year, and the production quota per worker for pig iron increased by 326 percent. The efficiency of equipment utilization has also been significantly improved. For example, the iron production efficiency of a certain furnace in Benxi in June of this year increased by 176 percent compared to August of last year. The consumption of raw materials has also gradually decreased.
    The achievement of these results ensures the continued reduction of the cost of industrial products.
    In the past year, basic construction projects in Northeast China have been vigorously carried out. The number of factories and mines under construction has increased by 136.5 percent compared to the third quarter of last year. The number of workers in August of this year increased by 135.6 percent compared to the end of August last year. The increase in technical personnel has been even more rapid, with an increase of 356.6 percent in August of this year compared to the same month last year.
    These achievements have been obtained through the arduous struggle of the entire working class. In the movement to oppose waste, create new records, and implement economic accounting, in the establishment and implementation of the production responsibility system, the technical management system, the cost management system, the quota management system, the contract system, the planning and statistical system, the budget and final accounts system, the safety responsibility system, and the piece-rate wage system based on the eight-grade wage system, and in the strengthening of the workshop system, these achievements have been guaranteed and promoted.
    The entire working class in Northeast China will take these achievements as a gift to the first National Day of the People's Republic of China.

　　东北国营工矿业
    一年来生产获巨大成绩
    生产总值超过去年同时期四倍多
    【本报沈阳讯】特约通讯员洪亮报道：建国一年来的东北国营工业生产，由于人民政府正确领导和全体职工努力劳动，已获得巨大的成绩。
    工业总产量的价值按不变价格累计到本年八月止，较去年同时期超过百分之四百三十六点一。产品项目增加了百分之二百十三点三。三十种主要产品，除煤一项以外（国家决定减产），有二十九种均超过去年同时期的产量。如电线超过百分之一千九百二十，硫氨超过百分之八百四十五点五，铁矿石超过百分之六百七十一，电炉钢锭超过百分之五百一十点七等。
    质量的提高虽然仍待极大努力，但也获得不小的成绩。例如工作母机在去年十月一日以前几乎全部不合规格，而现在不但全部合乎规格，而且消灭了三级品。生铁已消灭了号外铁。次布率已降至百分之三以下。灯泡的合格率已提到百分之九十以上，且能耐用二千小时以上。
    平板玻璃已能大量生产，且一级品已达百分之九十九。
    生产率显著提高，工时定额不断增大。按不变价值计算，本年八月较去年八月底以前，增加了百分之四百零三点四。在工时定额方面，如本溪所产钢锭每工的生产定额在本年六月已较去年八月增加百分之四百五十，生铁每工的生产定额增加了百分之三百二十六。设备运用效率亦有显著改进，如本溪某炉本年六月所产生铁效率已较去年八月提高百分之一百七十六。原材料的消费亦逐步降低。
    这些成绩的获得，保证了工业产品的成本继续降低。
    一年来，东北基本建设工程在大力进行中。开工的厂矿目前已较去年第三季增加了百分之一百三十六点五。工人在今年八月较去年八月底增加了百分之一百三十五点六。技术人员的增加更为迅速，今年八月较去年同月底增加了百分之三百五十六点六。
    这些成绩都是经过全体工人阶级艰苦斗争得来的。在反对浪费，创造新纪录，贯彻经济核算制运动中，在生产责任制，技术管理制度，成本管理制度，定额管理制度，合同制度，计划与统计制度，预决算制度，安全责任制度及八级工资制基础上的计件工资制度和加强车间制的建立和贯彻中，这些成绩才得到保证和发扬。
    东北全体工人阶级就把这些成绩做为给中华人民共和国第一个国庆日的献礼。
