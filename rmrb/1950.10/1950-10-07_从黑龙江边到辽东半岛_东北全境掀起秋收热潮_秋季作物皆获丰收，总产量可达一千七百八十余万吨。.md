Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 4th—From the Heilongjiang border to the Liaodong Peninsula, a tide of autumn harvesting has swept through the vast rural areas of Northeast China.

In the Dalian area at the southern tip of the Liaodong Peninsula, where the season starts earliest, the autumn harvest was completed in mid-September. In Yingkou and Haicheng counties in Liaodong Province, and Xinmin and Panshan counties in Liaoxi Province, on the Liao River Plain, the main crops such as sorghum and corn have been completely harvested and are now being threshed and stored. In Heilongjiang Province in northern Manchuria, after the province experienced an early frost in mid-September, a campaign to rush the harvest was launched, and now the harvesting work in the province has basically been completed.

During the autumn harvest, men, women, old and young in rural areas across the region all turned out, and the vast majority of the labor force and livestock participated in mutual aid teams for harvesting. This ensured that crops were harvested as they ripened, and were transported immediately after being cut, with no grain left behind. It also greatly shortened the autumn harvest time. The entire region can complete the autumn harvest this month, ten days to half a month earlier than in previous years.

This year, various autumn crops in Northeast China have achieved bumper harvests, with significantly increased yields. Songjiang Province has achieved the best harvest in over a decade, while the Liaoxi and Rehe provinces, which have suffered from years of disasters, have also achieved unprecedented harvests. The former has increased production by 30% compared to last year, while the latter has doubled production. According to estimates by the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Northeast People's Government, the total output of the entire region this year can reach more than 17.82 million tons, exceeding the original planned output by 6%.

　　从黑龙江边到辽东半岛
    东北全境掀起秋收热潮
    秋季作物皆获丰收，总产量可达一千七百八十余万吨。
    【新华社沈阳四日电】从黑龙江边到辽东半岛，东北广大农村已掀起收割秋禾的热潮。
    季节最早的辽东半岛南端的旅大地区，九月中旬即已完成秋收。辽河平原上的辽东省营口、海城等县和辽西省的新民、盘山等县，主要作物高粱、玉米等已全部收割完毕，正转入打场入仓阶段。北满黑龙江省于九月中旬普降早霜后，全省即展开抢割抢收，现全省收割工作已基本完成。
    在秋收中，各地农村男女老幼一齐出动，加之全区绝大部分劳动力和畜力参加了互助组进行收割，普遍做到了熟一片割一片，随割随拉，颗粒不丢，并大大缩短了秋收时间。全区可于本月全部完成秋收，较往年提早十天至半月。
    今年东北各种秋季作物皆获丰收，产量增加很多。松江省获得了十余年来所未有的十成年景，连年灾荒的辽西、热河两省亦均获得空前未有的丰收。前者较去年增收三成，后者则增收一倍。据东北人民政府农林部估计，全区今年总产量可达一千七百八十二万余吨，即可超过原订计划产量百分之六。
