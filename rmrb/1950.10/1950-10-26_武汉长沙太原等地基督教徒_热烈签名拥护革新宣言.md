Ai Weisheng, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Christian Association and Professor at Central China University, called for efforts to get 20,000 Christians in Hubei Province to sign the declaration. The Preparatory Committee of the Hunan Provincial Christian Associations Federation has issued a letter to fellow believers in various places, encouraging church members to support the Common Program and achieve unity, cooperation, and self-reliance. As of the 15th of this month, 606 Christians in Changsha had signed the declaration. The Hubei General Assembly of the Church of Christ in China has decided to send people to various churches to conduct publicity and education, promote production labor, encourage volunteer staff, and launch donations to solve church funding problems. The Anglican Church of the Xiang-E Diocese has also proposed a method of large churches assisting small churches and cities assisting rural areas to strive for self-sufficiency.

    On the 20th of this month, forty-four representatives from seventeen Christian units in Taiyuan held a symposium, enthusiastically supporting the declaration issued by Chinese Christian figures, unanimously believing that this is a historically significant document for Chinese Christianity, and that this declaration points out the correct direction for the efforts of religious circles in China.
