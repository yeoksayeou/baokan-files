Xinhua News Agency, October 21st:

　　The Chinese people's peace signature campaign has gained greater momentum due to the American imperialists' expansion of the war of aggression in Korea, which has aroused the righteous indignation of the Chinese people by threatening their safety. According to incomplete statistics as of October 19th, the number of people nationwide who have signed the declaration to defend peace has reached 195,166,010, accounting for 41 percent of the total national population; this is an increase of more than 38 million compared to the 156,187,434 signatures counted on October 5th, when the United Nations General Assembly, manipulated by American imperialism, passed an illegal proposal to expand the war of aggression in Korea. The number of peace signatures in major administrative regions is as follows: Northeast 29,207,025, accounting for 70 percent of the region's population; North China and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region 40,656,381, accounting for 59 percent of the region's population; East China 57,025,702, accounting for 43 percent of the region's population; Northwest 10,857,350, accounting for 40 percent of the region's population; Central South 42,179,932, accounting for 30.8 percent of the region's population; Southwest 14,563,475, accounting for 21 percent of the region's population; the Beijing People's Daily received 642,345 signatures from readers in various regions; Hong Kong 33,800. Except for the Southwest, all regions have exceeded the goal set by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace of the number of people to participate in the peace signature campaign. Among them, the Northwest exceeded the original target by more than double.
