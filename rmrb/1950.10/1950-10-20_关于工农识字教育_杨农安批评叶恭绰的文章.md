To the Editor:

　　After reading Mr. Ye Gongchuo's article "From the National Conference on Workers' and Peasants' Education to How to Expedite Workers' and Peasants' Literacy Education" in the Tianjin Progressive Daily on October 3rd, I found many points in it to be inappropriate. According to Mr. Ye's idea, in carrying out workers' and peasants' literacy education, there should be no distinction between men and women, adults and children (over six or seven years old). All illiterate people should be required to learn a minimum of one hundred characters within one year. After one year, if they still do not know one hundred characters, the parents of minors should be fined, and the rights of adults should be partially suspended. All public and private institutions, including government agencies, schools, factories, shops, organizations, and homes, should be required to teach all illiterate male and female workers, regardless of age, to recognize one hundred characters within three months, otherwise the person in charge of the institution will be punished and the worker may be dismissed. From a certain date onwards, no public or private institution shall employ illiterate workers, and violators will be fined. It is also stipulated that students in secondary schools and above should teach twenty people to read each year, which will be included in the school's performance evaluation, and those who fail will not be allowed to graduate. ...

　　I think the above points are incorrect because any mass movement, if it violates the principle of conscious voluntarism and is promoted by coercive orders or overly hasty methods, is an unthinkable thing. The workers' and peasants' literacy education in various places has already gained a lot of experience on this point. We must implement the policy of combining leadership with the masses based on the needs and willingness of workers and peasants. On the one hand, we must prevent laissez-faire, and on the other hand, we must resolutely oppose coercive orders and formalism. Therefore, the methods mentioned above, such as "fining their parents," "partially suspending their rights," "punishing the person in charge," "dismissal," "fining violators," and "not allowing those who fail to graduate," are all incorrect. If we do things according to this method, even if we can achieve some temporary results, it will be difficult to consolidate them because they lack a conscious and voluntary mass base. This approach makes it difficult for the workers and peasants to truly understand the meaning and role of literacy education, and it is easy for them to develop resentment, thus increasing the difficulty of carrying out the literacy movement. The central issue of carrying out workers' and peasants' literacy education is how to effectively carry out mobilization work, organizational work, and teaching work, specifically solve the learning difficulties of workers and peasants, and improve their awareness, learning interest, and enthusiasm. This is the most effective way to consolidate their learning motivation and ensure their learning results.

　　At the same time, the statement of "no distinction between adults and children" is also inappropriate. Minister Ma of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government said in his opening speech at the National Conference on Workers' and Peasants' Education: "The workers' and peasants' education we are referring to mainly refers to the education of the vast number of young and adult male and female workers and peasants on the production front and the training of workers' and peasants' intellectuals." This means that the current workers' and peasants' education should have a focus, and school-age children should be given the opportunity to enter general elementary schools as much as possible.

　　Finally, regarding the issue of teaching materials, Mr. Ye advocates that the one hundred characters taught in various places can be selected from the general dictionary selected by the Central People's Government. These one hundred characters are considered the first stage, and then the second, third to tenth stages are compiled, each stage consisting of about one hundred characters, and this is the limit for the time being. As far as I know, there is no general dictionary selected by the People's Government at present, and there may not necessarily be a mandatory dictionary in the future. I think this method of selecting characters is worth considering, because the current workers' and peasants' literacy is not purely for literacy's sake, but should be closely linked to the actual life and work of workers and peasants. This not only makes the characters easier to remember and improves learning interest, but also makes it possible to achieve a certain degree of ideological education, political education, and production education through literacy education. Therefore, selecting characters only from a general dictionary, without starting from the actual needs of the masses, makes it difficult to achieve the above requirements.

Editor's Note: Mr. Ye Gongchuo's spirit of supporting workers' and peasants' education is good, and Yang Nong'an's criticism of the methods he advocates is also correct. Workers' and peasants' literacy education must be carried out on the basis of the conscious voluntarism of the education objects, which is a very important principle. Any coercive methods that violate this principle will not only fail to achieve the desired results but are also prone to produce counter-effects and hinder the development of a truly mass literacy movement. At the same time, according to the current situation in our country, workers' and peasants' literacy education must be carried out step by step and with emphasis. Only in this way can this movement be effectively carried out. Due to the limitations of manpower, financial resources, materials, and the degree of mass awareness, it is in fact impossible for all workers and peasants to enjoy literacy education all at once. Naturally, the so-called emphasis does not mean refusing ordinary workers and peasants to participate in literacy learning. Any workers and peasants with urgent literacy needs should be taken care of.

### 关于工农识字教育  杨农安批评叶恭绰的文章

　　关于工农识字教育
    杨农安批评叶恭绰的文章编辑同志：
    读十月三日天津进步日报上叶恭绰先生的“从全国工农教育会议谈到怎样赶办工农识字教育”一文，我觉得里面有好多地方是不大妥当的。根据叶先生的意思，在开展工农识字教育时，可以不分男女，不分成年与儿童（六七岁以上的），凡不识字的人，以在一年内识一百个字为最低限度。一年之后如仍不识一百字的，若系未成年之人，则罚其家长，若系已成年的人则停止其权利之一部分。凡公私机关，包括政府机关、学校、工厂、商店、团体及家宅等等所已用的男女工人，不问年龄，如有不识字的，限该机关负责人于三个月内教会该工人识得一百个字，否则处罚该负责人，并得将该工人解雇。自某时期以后，任何公私机关不得进用不识字的工人，违者罚之。又规定中等以上学校的学生，每年应教会识字民众二十个，列入学校成绩内计算，如不及格的不得毕业。……。
    我觉得上述各点都是不正确的，因为任何一个群众性的运动，如违背了自觉自愿的原则，要用强迫命令或过于性急的办法来推动，那是一件不堪设想的事。关于这一点，各地的工农识字教育已取得了很多经验。我们必须根据工农需要与自愿的原则，贯彻领导与群众相结合的方针。一方面固然要防止放任自流，而另一方面必须坚决反对强迫命令与形式主义。所以上面所提到的“罚其家长”、“停止其权利之一部分”、“处罚该负责人”、“解雇”、“违者罚之”、“不及格的不得毕业”等方法，都是不正确的。假如根据这种办法去做的话，即使暂时能获得一些成绩，也是很难巩固的，因为缺乏群众的自觉自愿基础。这样做法很难使工农群众真正认识识字教育的意义和作用，反而容易使他们发生反感，因而增加了开展识字运动的困难。开展工农识字教育的中心问题是如何有效地进行动员工作、组织工作和教学工作，具体解决工农的学习困难，提高他们的自觉和他们的学习兴趣与热情。这是巩固他们的学习情绪、保证他们的学习成绩的最有效办法。
    同时“不分成年与儿童”的说法，也是不妥当的。中央人民政府教育部马部长在全国工农教育会议的开幕词里说：“我们所指的工农教育，主要的是指在生产战线上的广大青年和成年男女工人和农民的教育问题以及培养工农知识分子的问题。”这就是说，目前的工农教育是应该有重点的，而学龄儿童应该尽可能使其进一般小学学习。
    最后，关于教材问题，叶先生主张各地施教的一百字，可于中央人民政府选定通用字典内选取，这一百字算是第一程，另外再编第二程，第三程至第十程，每程约一百个字，暂以此为限。据我了解，现在并没有人民政府选定的通用字典，将来也不一定会有强制性的字典。我认为这种选字的方法，是值得考虑的，因为目前工农识字不是单纯为识字而识字，而应该与工农的实际生活和工作密切联系起来，这样不但字容易记得，学习兴趣容易提高，而且可以尽可能通过识字教育达到某种程度的思想教育、政治教育和生产教育的目的。所以光在通用字典里选字，而不从群众的实际需要出发，就很不容易达到上述的要求。
      杨农安
    编者按：叶恭绰先生拥护工农教育的精神是好的，杨农安批评他所提倡的方法也是正确的。工农识字教育工作必须在教育对象的自觉自愿基础上进行，这是一个很重要的原则。任何违反这个原则的强制办法，非但不能获得应有的效果，而且容易产生反作用，妨碍真正群众性的识字运动的开展。同时根据我国目前的实际情况，工农识字教育必须有步骤有重点地进行，只有这样，才能有效地开展这一运动。由于人力、财力、物力以及群众自觉程度等等的限制，事实上不可能一下子使所有工农都享受识字教育。自然，所谓有重点地进行，并不是拒绝一般工农分子参加识字学习，对于任何有迫切的识字要求的工农，都应该加以照顾。
