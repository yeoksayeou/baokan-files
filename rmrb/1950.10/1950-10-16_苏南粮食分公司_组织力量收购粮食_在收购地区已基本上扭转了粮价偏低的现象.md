　　Sunan Grain Branch
    Organizes Forces to Purchase Grain
    Basically Reversing the Phenomenon of Low Grain Prices in Purchasing Areas
    [This newspaper reports] According to the Sunan Daily News: Since the Sunan Administrative Office re-strengthened grain purchase arrangements on September 19th, the Sunan Grain Branch has rapidly organized forces to step up purchasing work. In the areas where grain is being purchased, the phenomenon of low grain prices has been basically reversed.
    As early as the beginning of August, Sunan's early rice began to enter the market. However, the China Grain Company's purchasing work did not begin until the end of August. Some speculative merchants took the opportunity to cut prices and purchase grain, causing particularly low grain prices in some areas; the urban markets also saw a situation of "more supply than demand." In Wuxi, due to the daily influx of new rice, the price of new rice fell from around 83,000 yuan in early August to 55,000 yuan at the end of August, a drop of more than 32 percent. From August 30th, the China Grain Company began purchasing in the market, and the low rice price was appropriately raised, stabilizing at around 60,000 yuan by early September.
    However, at that time, the grain companies at all levels in the Sunan area did not have a clear understanding of the purchasing routes and methods. The purchasing work remained in the cities and could not be deeply rooted in the countryside, and the suffering of farmers from price cuts was not resolved. The Sunan People's Administrative Office convened a meeting on industry, commerce, and trade in mid-September to redeploy the purchasing work.
    Following this meeting, the Sunan Grain Company first mobilized a large number of cadres to go to the countryside in each district, and established 102 purchasing points. In addition to the 22 entrusted cooperative agencies and the original 19 offices and business locations, 61 new purchasing points were added; including eight in the Zhenjiang District, twenty-four in the Changzhou District, eighteen in the Suzhou District, and eleven in the Songjiang District.
    At present, the rice purchasing work of the grain purchasing offices in each district has mostly begun. Each purchasing point has started purchasing.
    After the purchasing work was launched, the phenomenon of "low grain prices" in some areas in the past has been basically reversed. For example, in Gaochun in the Zhenjiang area, the price of rice was 48,000 yuan per dan before the purchase, which was raised to 50,000 yuan when the purchase started, and has now been appropriately adjusted to 54,000 yuan. In Baoyan, the rice price was 46,000 yuan before the purchase, and it was raised to 55,000 yuan after the purchase. In Jintan in the Changzhou District, the rice price has also been raised from 48,000 yuan in the past to 52,000 yuan, and the price of Qingyang's japonica rice has also been raised from 58,000 yuan before the purchase to 67,000 yuan.
    In September, most areas exceeded the purchasing task. The total amount of rice purchased in the Sunan area exceeded seven-tenths of the original plan. The Changzhou District completed 313.38 percent of the plan. The Songjiang District is a district with a large output of early rice in Sunan, but the purchasing work in this district started very late. The purchasing was carried out in mid-September after most of the farmers' early rice had been sold, so the district only completed 24.96 percent of the plan.
    However, the purchasing work has not yet truly penetrated the countryside. There is still a tendency to favor cities. In September, the purchasing figures in the four urban markets of Wuxi, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, and Changzhou accounted for more than one-half of the total purchasing figures. Taking the purchasing figures of the Suzhou District as an example: in September, 356,546 catties of rice were purchased in the cities of the Suzhou District, and only 73,252 catties of rice were directly purchased in the rural areas. The rice purchased in the cities was almost four times the rice purchased in the rural areas.
    One of the reasons why the work has not been able to penetrate the countryside is that some leading cadres do not have a clear understanding of the need to first take care of the interests of poor peasants and hired laborers, and believe that the rice harvesting time is very long, and that completing these tasks is not a problem, so they have relaxed the purchasing work; secondly, some leading cadres are still emphasizing the difficulties of insufficient personnel and too few warehouses, and they themselves do not have enough enthusiasm to overcome difficulties; in addition, some areas have not simplified the purchasing procedures enough, making farmers feel troubled. For example, farmers in the Zhenjiang District have all reflected this.
    In order to effectively safeguard the interests of farmers, the grain company branches at all levels need to further implement the administrative office's purchasing work deployment, go deep into the countryside, and carry out purchasing in a planned manner.

    组织力量收购粮食
    在收购地区已基本上扭转了粮价偏低的现象
    【本报讯】据苏南日报消息：苏南粮食分公司自九月十九日苏南行署重新加强购粮部署以后，已迅速组织力量，加紧展开收购工作。在进行购粮的地区，已基本上扭转了粮价偏低的现象。
    早在八月份初，苏南早稻即开始登场。但中粮公司的收购工作却迟到八月底才开始。有一些投机取巧的商人乘机杀价收购，使若干地区发生了谷价特贱的现象；各城市市场上也出现了“供多求少”的局面。无锡市由于上市数量日涌，新稻价从八月初的八万三千元左右，下泻到八月底的五万五千元，下跌幅度达百分之三十二以上。八月三十日起，中粮开始在市场进行收购，偏低的稻价才适当提高，至九月初旬，稻价已在六万元上下稳定下来。
    但是，当时苏南区各级粮食公司对收购路线和方法，认识还是不够明确的。收购工作停留在城市，迟迟地不能深入农村，农民遭受的压价杀价的痛苦并没有解决。苏南人民政行公署在九月中旬召开了工商贸易会议，重新部署了收购工作。
    紧随着这一会议后，苏南粮食公司在各分区首先动员了大批干部下乡，并设立了一百零二处收购点，除了二十二个委托合作社的代收处和本身原有的十九个办事处、营业所外，重新增设的收购处有六十一个；计镇江专区八个，常州专区二十四个，苏州专区十八个，松江专区十一个。
    目前各专区粮食收购处的收稻工作已大部开始。每个收购点都已进行收购。
    收购工作展开后，基本上已扭转了过去某些地区“粮价偏低”的现象。例如镇江区高淳收购前，每担稻四万八千元，收购开始时即提到五万元，目前又适当调整到五万四千元。宝堰收购前稻价四万六千元，收购后即提高到五万五千元。常州专区金坛稻价亦已从过去四万八千元提高到五万二千元，青暘的粳稻亦从收购前的五万八千元提高到六万七千元。
    九月份各地区大多超过收购任务。苏南区总的收稻数量已超过了原计划的十分之七。常州专区，完成计划的百分之三一三·三八。松江专区是苏南出产早稻较多的一区，但该区收购工作开始很迟，在农民早稻大多已出售完了的九月中旬才进行收购，因此该专区完成计划只百分之二四·九六。
    但是，收购工作到目前为止，还未能真正深入农村。仍存在力量偏重城市的倾向。九月份在无锡市、苏州市、镇江市、常州市四个城市市场上收购数字，占总收购数字的二分之一以上。如以苏州专区的收购数字来统计：九月份在苏州区各城市收进稻三五六、五四六斤，在乡区直接收进的稻只七三、二五二斤，城市收稻几乎超过了乡区收稻的四倍。
    工作所以未能深入农村的原因之一，是有些领导干部对首先照顾贫雇农利益的认识不够明确，认为收稻时间很长，完成这些任务是不成问题的，这样就放松了收购工作；其次，有些领导干部仍在强调人员不够、仓库太少的困难，本身对困难克服的积极性不够；此外也有些地区对于收购手续还不够简化，使农民感到麻烦，如镇江区农民就都有这反映。
    为了有效维护农民利益，各级粮食公司分支机构还需要进一步贯彻行署的收购工作部署，深入农村，有计划地进行收购。
