　　Stepped-Up War Preparations in Western Europe
    American Imperialism Openly Interferes in Italian Internal Affairs
    Demanding the Italian Government Further Persecute the Working Class
   [Xinhua News Agency, 23rd] Teton, the American administrator of the Marshall Plan in Italy, who is currently "inspecting" northern Italy, summoned representatives from the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors in Genoa on the 19th and openly demanded that Italy accelerate its war preparations. He instructed Italian capitalists to "purge communist elements" from their enterprises and criticized them for only focusing on their own profits while neglecting the "goals that must be achieved" – namely, the goals of American aggression.
   Electroneews indicated: This is the second time Teton has recently come forward to interfere in Italian internal affairs. Two weeks ago, he spoke out, forcing the Gasperi government to revise its financial policies in order to develop military production. This talk is seen as a signal directing Italian capitalists to attack the workers' movement.
   The Italian Communist Party's newspaper "L'Unità" published an article on the 20th, strongly condemning Teton's remarks, stating: "Teton should be told that even the Nazis were unable to eliminate the Communists; tell him that Genoa has a Communist mayor and a Communist municipal government, which indicates that the vast majority of the people support the Communist Party." "American agents get out of Italy! They are not allowed to interfere in our affairs again! Only in this way can Italian workers achieve economic recovery and improve the living standards of the people."

　　在西欧加速进行备战
    美帝公然干涉意内政
    竟要求意政府进一步迫害工人阶级
   【新华社二十三日讯】现在意大利北部“视察的”美国驻意大利马歇尔计划执行人台顿，于十九日在热那亚召集工商业界及金融界的代表谈话，公然要求加速意大利的备战步骤。他吩咐意大利资本家必须在企业中“清除共产党分子”，并指责他们不应只顾自己赢利而忽略了“必须达到的目标”——即美国侵略政策的目标。
   电通社指出：这是台顿最近以来出面干涉意大利内政的第二次。他曾在两周前发言迫令加斯贝利政府修改财政政策以发展军事生产。他这一次的谈话，被认为是指使意大利资本家进攻工人运动的信号。
   意大利共产党机关报“团结报”于二十日撰论痛斥台顿的谈话称：“应该告诉台顿：连纳粹也没有能够清除共产党人；告诉他：热那亚有一个共产党籍的市长和共产党人组成的市政府，这表示绝大多数人民是支持共产党的。”“美国代理人滚出意大利去！不许他们再干涉我们的事情！只有这样，意大利工人才能实现经济复兴和改善全国人民的生活条件。”
