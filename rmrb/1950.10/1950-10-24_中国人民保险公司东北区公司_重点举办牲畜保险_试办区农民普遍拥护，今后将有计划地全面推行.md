China People's Insurance Company Northeast Branch
    Focuses on Livestock Insurance
    Pilot Area Farmers Universally Support, Comprehensive Implementation Planned for the Future

    [By Our Newspaper] In order to promote agricultural production in the Northeast and increase farmers' enthusiasm for production, the Northeast People's Government has approved the "Rural Livestock Insurance Measures," entrusting the China People's Insurance Company Northeast Branch to focus on pilot programs and prepare for comprehensive implementation in the future in a step-by-step and planned manner. After receiving this task, the People's Insurance Company Northeast Branch selected Gaiping in Liaodong Province and Yongji in Jilin Province as pilot areas. In August, it dispatched a large number of cadres to form work groups, which went to rural areas in the two locations to conduct practical publicity and promotion work. The livestock insurance measures were deeply welcomed and supported by the vast number of farmers. For example, the town leader of Gaiping Town, Men Chuanqing, said, "The government's implementation of livestock epidemic prevention has already given us great care. Now that the National Insurance Company has also started livestock insurance, we really don't have to worry about not being able to plant the land if the livestock die." The local villagers also reflected, "After insuring livestock, not only are we compensated for deaths, but also for medical treatment when they are sick. It's really worthwhile." All eligible livestock in the area, except for seven heads due to special reasons (five of which did not return due to going out for production, and two of which had not completed the necessary procedures due to sales relations), enthusiastically participated in the insurance. The company has also made appropriate improvements to certain shortcomings in business based on existing experience (such as simplifying insurance procedures and strengthening institutional ties), and has formulated a preliminary development plan for this year, which includes the following areas: Changchun, Nongan, Huaide, Jiutai, Yanji, Jiaohe, Panshi, and Shuangyang in Jilin Province; Fuxian and Haicheng in Liaodong Province; Tieling and Shuangliao in Liaoxi Province; Shuangcheng, Acheng, and Hulan in Songjiang Province; and Longjiang and Nehe in Heilongjiang Province. The business is led by the provincial people's insurance company branches, and the county and town agencies are attached to the Northeast Bank branches in the area.

    The insured objects of livestock insurance are cattle, horses, mules, and donkeys. The premium rates are determined according to the different natures of draft animals, work animals, breeding animals, and dairy animals, with draft animals being the main focus. The premium is 36 yuan per thousand yuan per year. Collectives or production mutual aid groups that purchase insurance are given discounts. In order to take care of the economic strength of the farmers, it is also stipulated that premiums can be paid within three months from the date of insurance. The insurance liability of livestock insurance is very broad. The insurance company is responsible for compensation if the insured livestock dies due to various infectious diseases, internal and surgical diseases, dystocia, castration, fire, lightning strikes, falls, drowning, or obvious external accidents, or if it does not die but permanently loses all its utility value. Furthermore, the insurance company is fully responsible for medical expenses for illness or injury up to 20% of the insured amount.

　　中国人民保险公司东北区公司
    重点举办牲畜保险
    试办区农民普遍拥护，今后将有计划地全面推行
    【本报讯】为促进东北农业生产，提高农民的生产热情，东北人民政府特批准农村牲畜保险办法，交由中国人民保险公司东北区公司重点试办，并有步骤有计划地作今后全面实行的准备。人民保险公司东北区公司接获此项任务后，即择定辽东省的盖平与吉林省的永吉两地为实验区，并于八月间调派大批干部，成立工作组，分赴两地农村，作实际宣传与推进工作。该项牲畜保险办法深受广大农民的欢迎与拥护，如盖平镇镇长门传庆说：“政府实行牲畜防疫，已经给了我们很大的关心，现在国家保险公司又开办牲口保险，这以后真不要担心死了牲口种不上地了。”当地老乡们也反映道：“投保牲畜险交一些保费后，不光死了管赔，病了还管医，真是合得来。”该地全部及龄牲畜除有七头因特殊原因（内五头因出门生产没有回来，两头因买卖关系尚未办好必要手续）未能投保外，余皆踊跃参加保险。该公司并根据现有经验，对于业务上的若干缺点已作适当的改进（如简化投保手续、加强机构联系等），并拟定本年度初步开展计划，计发展地区有：吉林省的长春、农安、怀德、九台、延吉、蛟河、磐石、双阳；辽东省的复县、海城；辽西省的铁岭、双辽；松江省的双城、阿城、呼兰；黑龙江省的龙江、讷河等县。业务由各省人民保险公司分公司领导，各县镇代理处即附设在该地东北银行分支机构内。
    牲畜保险的承保对象为牛、马、骡、驴四种；其费率系按照耕畜、力畜、种畜、奶畜四种不同性质而订定，其中以耕畜为主，保费每年每千元为三十六元。集体或生产互助小组投保，另有折扣优待。为照顾农民的经济力量，并规定可以自投保日起延期在三个月内缴付保费。牲畜保险的承保责任甚广，凡投保牲畜因各种传染病、内外科疾病、胎产、阉割、火灾、雷殛、摔伤、落水或外来之明显事故所致之死亡，或虽未死亡而永远丧失全部利用价值者，保险公司均负赔偿责任；再如因病、伤之医疗费用，在保额百分之二十以内，也全部由保险公司负责。
