　　Section Chief Returns Home Arrogantly, District and Village Cadres Helpless
　　Letter from the Communications Group of the Lingchuan County Party Committee

Comrade Editor:

Lu Hefu, from Hedong Village, Third District, Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province, is a cadre who has participated in revolutionary work for over ten years and is currently the Section Chief of the Organizational Teaching Section of the Northwest Bureau Party School. This year, on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month, he returned from Xi'an to visit his family. After listening to the one-sided story of his elder brother, Lu Genlei (a household that was struggled against), he believed that the village's work was not done well, arbitrarily scolded the village cadres, intimidated the masses, and distorted marriage policies; and in order to worship ancestors for his own family, he forced others to destroy green crops. This has resulted in village cadres being unwilling to work and confusion among the masses.

Lu Hefu originally came from a poor peasant background, with two rooms and three and a half mu of land. During the land reform, because he had been away for more than ten years without any news, and there were no other people in his family, he was not allocated anything. His elder brother, Lu Genlei, was a member of the Sanqing Corps and served as a puppet village deputy. In June 1943, one dark night, Lu Genlei, for personal revenge, tricked the villager Qin Jingyin into the wilderness and beat him to death. Therefore, in the mass movement, the masses in the village struggled against Genlei. This time, when Lu Hefu returned home, he lived in Genlei's house. Genlei told him how bad the village cadres were, and he harbored resentment. On the same day, Zhang Sangou, the deputy secretary of the village's CCP branch, and others went to visit him with great enthusiasm. As soon as he saw Sangou, he became furious. He said to Zhang Sangou: "You are all doing well! Look! What has become of my family! You have messed up the village! Why was my brother also struggled against? Who said he is not a good person?" He became more and more angry, and pointed his finger at Sangou, saying: "Was it you who instigated the struggle against my brother? You should reflect on yourself; otherwise, I will write to the prefectural committee and ask them to rectify your style."

Sangou reported this situation to the district committee. The responsible comrade of the district committee went to talk to Lu Hefu to investigate and mediate the matter. But Lu Hefu did not take the district committee seriously either, and still did not speak well: "Zhang Sangou does not understand the Party Constitution and is not qualified as a party member; you district cadres should be responsible for handling these issues..." As a result, the district cadres did not dare to talk to him.

On the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month, Lu Hefu gathered more than 30 people, including clansmen, relatives, friends, and village cadres, and set up a large banquet with drums and music to worship his ancestors at the graves. At that time, it was the season when the masses were busy weeding and fertilizing, and everyone was unwilling to accompany him to worship the ancestors, but Lu Hefu said to them: "I have not been home for many years, my family is broken and dead, and fellow villagers and relatives should reluctantly help." Everyone could not refuse, so they had to reluctantly comply. The cemetery was cultivated by his cousin Lu Cunfu, and the corn was growing very well. Lu Hefu, on the one hand, had a private grudge with Cunfu, and on the other hand, wanted to show off, so he asked Lu Cunfu to pull out the corn from the edge of the field to the tomb, leaving a path for setting up tables, offering sacrifices, kowtowing, and burning incense. Although the village cadres and the masses felt that this matter was a bit excessive, they did not dare to say anything. Lu Cunfu's mother pleaded repeatedly, saying: "It is not easy to grow a crop! The government is calling for increased production, so you can't cut immature crops." But Comrade Hefu's attitude was very stubborn. The mother and son had no choice but to harden their hearts and run to the field to cut down immature corn one by one. Everyone couldn't bear to watch it anymore. Hefu was afraid of a major incident, so he told Lu Cunfu not to cut it anymore, but forty or fifty plants had already been cut down.

Lu Hefu believed that there was something wrong with the village cooperative's installment collection of shares. When the village held a mass meeting to arrange frost prevention and wheat planting, and the cadres asked him to speak, he immediately said to the masses: "Our village cooperative is too bad, it is a 'joint opposition society' and a 'eat-collapse society'. The cadres just don't know the suffering of the people." Then he picked on the shortcomings of the cadres, administrative orders, opposition from the masses, etc., saying everything, even if it didn't exist, making the cadres worthless and turning them into thorns in the eyes of the masses. When arranging the task of preventing frost and planting wheat, it ended in discord.

After Lu Hefu returned, he heard about many divorce issues, and he immediately told the women cadres: "In the future, you must take control and not let the people all get divorced. If too many divorce, you will be responsible."

At the mass meeting, watching the women singing and laughing, he said to the women: "What kind of decency is this, too undisciplined." As a result, the women were silent and had to pout and wait for the meeting to begin.

After the above problems occurred, the situation in the village was once chaotic, and the village cadres asked the district committee not to do their work. The district committee discussed the solution with Lu Hefu, but Comrade Hefu said: Is this problem to be solved by the government, or is it to be handled by organizational procedures? The district cadres could not answer, and in the end, there was no way to end it. The district and village cadres then requested the county to find a solution. The county has requested the prefecture and district committee to handle it.

### 科长回乡盛气凌人区村干部手足无措  陵川县委通讯组来信报告

　　科长回乡盛气凌人区村干部手足无措
    陵川县委通讯组来信报告编辑同志：
    山西陵川三区河东村路和富同志，是一个参加革命工作十余年的干部，现任西北局党校组教科长。今年旧历七月七日，他从西安回来看望家人。他听了哥哥路根垒（被斗户）一面之词，认为村里的工作做得不好，随便责骂村干部，威吓群众，歪曲婚姻政策；并为了自家祭祖，逼迫别人毁掉青苗。因而造成村干部不愿工作，群众思想混乱等现象。
    路和富原系贫农成份，有房两间，地三亩半。土地改革时，因他在外十几年没有音信，家内又无其他的人，故没给他分配什么。他的哥哥路根垒，是个三青团员，又当过伪村副。在一九四三年六月间一个黑夜里，路根垒为了私仇，曾与秦天顺把村民秦景银哄到野外，活活打死。因而在群众运动中，该村群众把根垒斗了一下。这次路和富回家，就住在根垒家里，根垒跟他说了村干怎样不对，他就怀恨在心。当日有该村中共支部副支书张三狗同志等怀着一片热情前往看望他。他一见三狗，便大发脾气。他对张三狗说：“你们都好吧！看！我的家成了个什么样子！你们把村上搞得乱七八糟！为啥把我哥哥也斗争了？谁说他不是个好人？”他越说越气大，就用手指指点着三狗说：“斗争我哥哥是不是你们搞的鬼？你应该好好反省一下；不然，我就给地委写信，叫整你们的风。”
    三狗把这情况报告给区委。区委负责同志前往与路和富谈话，调查与调解这件事情。但路和富同样不把区委看在眼里，仍无好话：“张三狗不懂党章，不够党员资格；你们区干部应该负责处理这些问题……”因之区干部也不敢和他谈话了。
    旧历七月十五日，路和富召集族人、亲友、村干等三十多人作陪，大设酒席，鼓乐喧天，要登坟祭祖。当时正是群众忙于锄苗上肥时节，大家都不愿陪他祭祖，但路和富向他们说：“我多年未曾回家，家破人亡，乡亲族友，应委曲帮忙。”大家无法推托，只得勉强应付。坟地是他族弟路存富耕种的，玉茭长的很好。路和富一面因与存富有私仇，一面又要要排场，要路存富拔去从地边到坟头的玉茭，腾出一条路来，以便设桌、摆供、叩头、烧香。村干和群众虽认为此事有些过火，但不敢吭声。路存富母亲再三哀求说：“长一棵庄稼好不容易！政府号召增加生产，可不能割了不成熟的庄稼呀。”但和富同志态度十分顽强，母子无奈，硬着心肠跑到地里把一棵一棵未成熟的玉茭活活割倒。大家也看不过眼了，和富怕出大乱子，才叫路存富不要割了，但已经割倒了四五十颗。
    路和富认为该村合作社分期收股金有毛病，当该村召开群众大会，布置防霜种麦，干部请他讲话时，他即向群众说：“咱村的合作社太不成样子，是‘共反社’、‘吃塌社’。干部就不知道老百姓的痛苦。”接着就挑剔干部的毛病，行政命令呀，群众反对呀等等，反正有也说，没也说，把干部说了个一文不值，说成了群众眼里的刺。布置防霜种麦任务时，落得个不欢而散。
    路和富回来后，听到了很多离婚问题，他即告诉妇女干部说：“以后你们要掌握住，不要让老百姓都离起婚来，如果离的多了，你要负责。”
    他在群众大会上，看着妇女们唱歌，说说笑，即向妇女提出：“你们这成个什么体统，太没规矩。”这样一来，妇女们鸦雀无声，只好撅起嘴来等着开会。
    以上问题发生后，曾使该村情况一度发生混乱，村干部向区委提出不干工作。区委和路和富商量解决，和富同志反而说：这问题是由政府解决，还是以组织手续处理？区干答复不来，最后还是无法收场，区村干部才请求县设法解决。县已请求专署地委处理。
