The Image of the Combat Hero
　　Zang Kejia

　　For more than a decade, no, for decades, we have lived in war. From the era of the Great Revolution until the national liberation, war tormented us and destroyed us; but at the same time, war was purgatory. Through it, we established our own paradise on earth, and it gave us a new life. We have rich experience in wartime life, and many of our writers have not only matured in the war but have also grown up in it. They have witnessed countless earth-shattering scenes and tragic and heroic events. Because of this fertile land, where seeds were sown long ago, the literary and artistic creation with the army as its theme has had a relatively gratifying harvest in the past year. The works reflecting war and combat heroes are multifaceted, each with its own meaning and color. Based on my personal interests and insights, I have selected some works from this field over the past year to discuss, hoping to see the whole picture of the war and the significance of its development and victory from these many works with different themes.

　　Let's start with the poem "Eighteen Thousand Mu of Fertile Land Opened by Heroes" (see the "Mass Literature and Art" weekly of the Xi'an "Mass Daily" on June 4, 1950, reprinted in "Xinhua Monthly") as a leading example. This is a portrayal of the Huanglong Mountain reclamation by a certain army unit. Since Chairman Mao called on the troops to engage in the production movement, this type of theme has taken on a new meaning in the new situation. This poem is full of heroic spirit. The heroes of production, using the fighting spirit of turning barren mountains into fertile land, swing their picks and shovels, and also raise their voices in song:

　　Long, long Huanglong, golden and bright,
　　Yellow uniforms flutter on Huanglong Mountain,
　　"August 1st" cap badges shine with golden light,
　　Iron picks dance and gleam.

　　East side, west side,
　　Upper side, lower side,
　　Better than the "Pyramid of Acrobats" in the West,
　　Layer upon layer connecting to the sky.

　　One pick after another,
　　One shovel after another,
　　Never stopping the pick, never straightening the back,
　　Eyes fixed on the tip of the pick.

　　Vast barren land,
　　Pick falls, earth blooms,
　　Picks and shovels dance all over the mountain,
　　Transforming into fertile fields piece by piece...

　　An optimistic atmosphere of collective heroism allows people to breathe in a kind of strength. The tune is cheerful and magnificent, and the rhythm of the verses is in harmony with the rise and fall of the picks and shovels in the hands of these soldiers and the beating of their hearts. This tone and spirit emanate from the new people's confidence in creating a new life in the future.

　　Similarly themed, "Spring in the World" (see "People's Daily," May 29, 1950) is a report on the large-scale production of ditch digging by the North China People's Liberation Army. "Xinhua Monthly" included it in the "Troop Production" section of the political department, but in reality, it is a simple and beautiful essay. The author did not deliberately use a "literary style" to create art there, but simply and truthfully recorded the facts. Although it lacks the spirit and atmosphere of the above poem, it has its own sentiment that distinguishes it from scientific writing. This team, the "victorious army" in the eyes of the people, even the division commander, are all engaged in hard but happy labor. They work, and at the same time, they study culture, sing, and entertain themselves. For them, work is not only the source of life, but also the source of happiness.

　　"Storm at Sea" is an extremely famous report (see "Liberation Daily," March 9, 1950, reprinted in "People's Daily"). What it describes seems almost impossible, but it is absolutely true. If you look at it with old eyes, it is a "legend." Yes, our People's Liberation Army (not just the People's Liberation Army) has created many "legends," and they themselves are "legendary" figures! A row of people was swept by a storm onto a deserted island with only one family, putting them to the test surrounded by bandit troops, hunger, wind, and rain – all kinds of enemies. They were in a deadly place, but they firmly believed that they must live! (Because they believed that the Party and the higher authorities would never forget them!) They really survived. For these people who "still pay for sweet potatoes," not only did the old man with painful experiences shout "What a sight?", but not only in his eyes, were these soldiers who "leave you the jar of rice even when we are starving" "strange people," but even we who read this article feel that these people are too ordinary and yet too extraordinary!

　　Lu Zhuguo published his long serial – "Duel" in "Literary Work," and when "People's Literature" published it according to the chapter, it added the word "Report" in parentheses under the subtitle, which is reasonable. Structurally, as a novel, it lacks a rigorous and organic organization; as a report, it shows some of the characteristics of a novel – the characters are very lively. Although each chapter is like a picture, the characters are consistent throughout. Not only are Battalion Commander Wang Guangwen and Instructor Zhang Ming standing before our eyes with our eyes closed, but also the telephone operator Xiao Liu and the old Zhao, who specializes in making horse meat for people and treats the leaders with a father's heart, are extremely kind to us. This report shows us many different scenes. It is detailed, vivid, and quite profound.

　　Since our troops moved from the countryside to the city, this new reality inevitably caused new changes in the minds of the soldiers who came from peasant backgrounds. Lu Ying's short story – "Tang Erhu" (see "Yangtze River Daily," September 5, 6, and 7, 1949, reprinted in "Xinhua Monthly") raised this issue. It is timely and fresh. He sent a combat hero, Tang Erhu, to a factory. He looked down on the workers, full of combat bravery and self-importance. As a result, he made a fool of himself and caused trouble. Later, after studying and seeing the greatness of the workers' strength with his own eyes, Tang Erhu's ideological problems were resolved.

　　There are many works on the theme of new heroism. I will only mention two short stories, "Yin Qingchun" (see "People's Literature," Volume 2, Issue 2) and "A Basket of Oil" (see "People's Daily," January 29, 1950, reprinted in "Xinhua Monthly"). If we compare them, we will gain a clear understanding of the essence of new heroism. The author of "Yin Qingchun" placed Yin Qingchun in an extremely difficult battle, but there is a great force supporting him to fight for the people! To fight to become a glorious Communist Party member. This is why he finally overcame what seemed impossible to overcome. If it is considered a shortcoming that Yin Qingchun went a little too far compared to other soldiers, then "A Basket of Oil" makes up for this. "A Basket of Oil" is different from "Yin Qingchun." Daily life replaces the tense scenes of war. "A Basket of Oil" – a twenty-three-year-old combat hero, became a burden to his class during a training competition because of his physical condition. Everyone ridiculed him and disliked him. As a result, the squad leader was criticized by many comrades at the cadre meeting for his "championshipism," which finally made him understand that "championshipism is for personal heroism, regardless of others," and "new heroism must be for everyone to help others."

　　Among the works depicting the relationship between the army and the people, there is a short story by Liu Zhixia published in "Shandong Literature" – "Laying Straw." For a handful of straw, an excellent young soldier and a newly risen emancipated middle peasant, Wang Laotou, who was also very enthusiastic about supporting the army, had a dispute. For the circumstances and historical situation of both parties, this event seemed accidental; but for a soldier who was unwilling to walk another step after entering the village and urgently needed rest, and an old farmer who had already provided straw and added an extra thirty pounds of straw to support the army, it was reasonable to argue over a handful of cattle straw. But they immediately each received a severe criticism. The army is a revolutionary army, and the people are revolutionary people. Although their behavior is small, it is not permissible! Afterward, they did not permit themselves either. The young soldier went to apologize to Wang Laotou but did not meet him. He went to buy hemp to repair stretchers; when Wang Laotou went to find the young soldier with remorse, he could no longer find him. He had already sacrificed in the attack. This further increased Wang Laotou's guilt and sorrow, and also increased the touching power of this novel. This fact gave this old man not only guilt and sorrow, but more active action. It gives the reader not only emotion. This thing reflects the author's familiarity with wartime life, rich and dense atmosphere. But in structure, it lacks unity. The first-person storytelling form and the development of the story itself are contradictory. The former is like foreskin, but cannot contain the content of this story.

　　Let's examine another short story on the theme of caring for the wounded and sick – "Fortress" (see "People's Literature," Volume 2, Issue 3). The author did not superficially and trivially describe how attentive the comrades responsible for taking care of them were, but only showed their great spirit of sharing weal and woe when the Japanese devils came to the street for inspection. At the same time, from the actions of the people who risked their lives to hide them, and from the way they treated them like family members, the relationship between the army and the people was revealed. From the above two relationships, we can see an important factor in the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan.

　　"Company Commander Guan" (see "People's Literature," Volume 1, Issue 3, reprinted in "Xinhua Monthly") and "The Story of Liubao" (see "Literature and Art," Volume 1, Issue 3, reprinted in "Xinhua Monthly") are two very prominent works that show the new qualities of the People's Liberation Army. Company Commander Guan is fierce to the enemy, and a photo of his child with the words "Dad receive" written on it is treasured in his pocket. Surrounding the enemy in a Western-style building, he discovered through his binoculars that there were innocent little faces pasted on the glass window on the second floor, pasted so tightly that their noses were flattened. Originally, he could have hoisted up a cannon to smash the building and the enemy together, but he led the team to charge and sacrificed himself. Although "The Story of Liubao" is a love story, it is by no means a general vulgar love novel. It not only writes about our protagonist Li Jin falling in love with the persecuted Second Sister, but more importantly, how he loved her. If it were not for the same class, the same fate, the same hope, and the same struggle connecting them, their hearts would not be connected. He can give up her as a lover, but he will never give up her as a class sister to save her. In this way, personal happiness and the destiny of the people are unified in this young deputy squad leader. A new noble quality is revealed in the light of love. The ideological and artistic nature of this novel have reached a considerable level. (Of course, individual, minor shortcomings that need to be corrected still exist.)

　　Last year, Li Gao published two novels on the theme of the army, both of which were very excellent. However, after reading "Always Facing Forward" (see "People's Literature," Volume 2, Issues 4 and 5), I felt that although the image of the characters in "Old Battalion Commander" (see "Fiction," Volume 3, Issue 3, reprinted in "Xinhua Monthly") was vivid and moving, compared with the former, it lacked a momentum of ups and downs in structure, and its theme and ideology were also weaker than the former, because "Old Battalion Commander" only wrote about a combat hero and did not solve any problems. "Always Facing Forward" raised the struggle between "empiricism" and "doctrinairism" among important cadres in the army, thereby resolving it. The impact of these two conflicting forces seriously harmed the combat power of our troops. In this novel, they are represented by Deputy Regiment Commander Ma Dehui and Chief of Staff Yu Rui. As soon as Regiment Commander Li, as a positive force, appeared, the entire situation turned with his arrival. This contradiction was finally resolved through criticism and self-criticism. This criticism and self-criticism was not spoken in the meeting, but the cruel battles on the battlefield made it for them. This grand structure, this scene of unity of contradictions, powerfully attracts readers. These three characters are described in parallel, and it is almost impossible to determine who should be the protagonist. Regiment Commander Li, with one arm, is more prominent, more vivid, and richer. This image should be said to be an outstanding artistic image in literary and artistic creation in the past year, right?

　　It is rare for army literature and art to feature leaders above the regiment level as the protagonists. Liu Baiyu's "Firelight Ahead" is of pioneering significance in this regard. Soon after the army crossed the river last year, such a relatively in-depth and large-scale reflection was obtained in art, which is a valuable effort and harvest. In this novella, he not only wrote about Division Commander Chen Xingcai and Political Commissar Liang Bin, but also about regiment commanders, section chiefs, staff officers, company commanders, soldiers, and guerrillas. The spirit of these two division-level leaders in carrying out their tasks and their will to overcome difficulties are always implemented in all aspects and dominate the actions of the whole body. Although they are sometimes not there, we feel that they are. Their eyes not only look at the enemy, but also look at their own troops. Like an oil painting, at first glance, although it feels colorful and diverse, the tone is unified, solemn, and magnificent. In cooperation with this great scene, this work has a kind of enthusiasm and momentum to impact people. Although the author infects the political commissar with a little too much intellectual sentiment, it does not reach the point of damaging the seriousness and strength of this image.

　　From the author's other short story – "Six O'Clock in the Morning" (see "People's Daily," November 13, 1949), we can see some shadows of the novella "Firelight Ahead," but it is not its abbreviation. Although it also wrote about division commanders, political commissars... this short story puts the theme on the "ideological problems" of the troops, and focuses on writing about Battalion Commander Shen Guiliang, writing about his criticism of Company Commander Chen Heming's "Camping is not as good as living in a Western-style building" and the impact of the city. This shows that the People's Liberation Army is not only constantly defeating the enemy, but also constantly defeating itself.

　　My introduction is over. These works were selected from some materials I came into contact with when I edited the magazine and read the manuscripts. Of course, there are some new themes and topics that our writers have not yet touched upon. The unexplored field of army literature and art is still very broad for us today. The works we have written are still too few compared to what the war has provided us. What we have heard and seen is more moving than what we have written and read, but our writers have already given us assurance with their achievements: in the near future, even more magnificent great works will be produced.

### 战斗英雄的形象

　　战斗英雄的形象
    臧克家
    十几年来，不，几十年来，我们一直在战争里过日子，从大革命时代一直到全国解放，战争折磨着我们，毁灭着我们；但同时，战火就是炼狱，经过了它我们才在人间建立起自己的天堂，它使我们得到了新生。我们有了丰富的战争生活经验，我们许多作家不但在战争里成熟而且是在战争里成长起来。多少惊天动地的场面，悲惨雄壮的事实，他们都亲眼看到过，亲身体验过。因为有了这一片沃土，沃土上早就撒下了种子，所以一年来，以部队为主题的文艺创作，有了这样比较可喜的收成。在反映战争和战斗英雄的作品是多方面的，各有自己的意义和色彩。根据我个人的志趣和见解，把一年来属于这方面的作品挑出一些来谈一谈，以期从这许多不同主题的作品看到战争的全貌以及它的发展和胜利的意义。
    我们先拿《十八万亩良田英雄开》（见一九五○年六月四日西安《群众日报》《群众文艺》周刊，《新华月报》转载过）一首诗来带头。这是某军黄龙山开荒的写照。自从毛主席号召部队从事生产运动以来，这类主题在新的情况下就有了崭新的意义。这篇诗是英雄气概的。生产的英雄们，用了把荒山变良田的战斗精神，起落着镐锹，也起落着歌声：
    长长黄龙黄艳艳呵，
    黄龙山上飘着黄衣衫，
    “八一”帽徽放金光呵，
    铁镐飞舞亮光闪。
　
    东一片呵西一片，
    上一片呵下一片，
    赛过西天“叠罗汉”呵，
    层层叠叠连接天。
　
    一镐紧接一镐呵，
    一锹接一锹，
    不停镐、不直腰，
    两眼盯着镐头尖。
　
    大片荒地呵，
    镐落土开花，
    锹镐满山舞呵，
    片片变良田……
    一种乐观的集体英雄主义的气氛使人呼吸到一种力量，调子是欢快而雄壮的，诗句的音节是和这些战士们手里镐锹的起落、心脏的跳动合拍而谐和的。这种音调和气魄是从新的人对未来新生活创造的信心里发生出来的。
    同样主题的一篇《人间的春天》，（见一九五○年五月二十九日《人民日报》）是华北人民解放军挖渠大生产的报道。《新华月报》把它收到政治之部“部队生产”里去了，实际上它是一篇朴素美丽的散文。那位作者并没有故意用“文艺笔调”在那里作文章，那只是真切地，实在地记述事实。虽然缺乏上面那篇诗样的气魄和气氛，但自有一种情调使它和科学文字分开。这一队人民眼里的“胜利军”，连师长也一样，在艰苦然而快乐的劳动。他们工作着，同时也学习文化、也唱歌、也娱乐。对他们，工作不但是生活的源泉，工作也变成快乐的源泉。
    《海上风暴》是极为出名的一篇报告（见一九五○年三月九日《解放日报》，《人民日报》转载过），它所描写的简直像不可能发生的，可是它是千真万确的。如果拿老眼光去看，它是“传奇”。是的，我们的解放军（岂只解放军）创造了许多“传奇”，他们本身就是“传奇”人物！一排人被暴风卷到了一个仅有一家人家的孤岛上，把他们放在匪军、饥饿、风雨种种敌人的包围圈里去考验。他们是在死地里，但他们坚信一定得活！（因为相信党和上级决不会忘记他们！）他们果然得活了。对于这些“吃地瓜还给钱”的人们，不但那家有着痛苦经历的老年人大呼“啥景？”，不但在他眼里，这群“在我们饿死的时候也把那罐米给你留下”的战士是“奇怪人”，连我们读着这篇文章的人也觉得这些人是太平常而又太不平常的人了！
    陆柱国在“文艺工作”上发表了他的长篇连载——“决斗”，“人民文学”按章刊登的时候，却在小标题下面的括弧里加上了“报告”两个字，这是合理的。从结构上看，作为小说它欠缺严密和有机的组织，作为报告它却表现了一部分小说的特色——人物很活，虽然一章一章像图画，而人物却是贯穿到底的。作者以第一人称的“记者”身分开头带我们走到“碉堡之夜”，他便悄然引退，叫我们直接去接触那些人物，那些战斗。不但营长王光文、教导员张明人闭眼就站在眼前，就是电话员小刘、专做马肉给人吃的以父亲心肠对待首长的老赵，对我们也极为亲切。这篇报告给我们看了许多不同的场面。它是细致的、生动的，相当深刻的。
    自从我们的部队从乡村开到都市里来，这个新的现实在农民出身的士兵心理上必然会引起新的变化。陆荧的短篇——《唐二虎》（见一九四九年九月五、六、七日《长江日报》，《新华月报》转载过）提出了这个问题，它是及时的，新鲜的。他把一个战斗英雄唐二虎送到一个工厂里去，他看不起工人，满身战斗的勇敢的精神和自负，结果闹了笑话，闯下了祸。后来经过学习，亲眼看到了工人力量的伟大，唐二虎的思想问题得到了解决。
    关于新英雄主义主题的作品是极多的，我只提出《尹青春》（见《人民文学》二卷二期）和《一篓油》（见一九五○年一月二十九日《人民日报》、《新华月报》转载过）这两个短篇来谈谈，如果我们把它们对照起来看，对于新英雄主义的本质会得到一个清楚的认识。《尹青春》的作者把尹青春这个人物安放在极为艰苦的战斗里，但有一个大力量在支持着他为人民而战！为争取做一个光荣的共产党员而战。这就是他终于克服了像是不可能克服的苦难的原因。如果觉得尹青春这个人物比起别的战士们来走得太远了一点是一个缺点的话，那么《一篓油》就补救了这一点。《一篓油》和《尹青春》不同，日常生活代替了战争的紧张场面。《一篓油》——一个二十三岁的战斗功臣，在练兵竞赛的时候，因为身体的关系却变成了他那一班的累赘。大家嘲弄他，嫌弃他。结果是班长受到了干部会议上许多同志给予他的“锦标主义”的批判，终于使他明白了“锦标主义是为了要个人英雄，不管别人”，而“新英雄主义必须得为了大伙帮助别人”。
    描写军民关系的作品，有刘知侠发表在《山东文艺》上的一个短篇——《铺草》。为了一把铺草，一个优秀的青年战士和一个新上升的翻身中农，同时对拥军支前也颇为热心的王老头起了争执。对于他们双方的环境和历史情况来说，这事件好似是偶然的；但对于一个走得再也不愿多走一步的刚进村子急需休息的战士和一个已经出了草而且格外加了三十斤草的拥军的老农民，为了一把牛草争执起来却是入情入理的。但是他们立即各自得到了一个严厉的批评。军队是革命的军队，人民是革命的人民，他们这种行为虽然是微小的但是不许可的！过后，他们也不许可自己。青年战士去给王老头赔不是却没有碰上，他去买麻收拾担架去了；等王老头带着悔恨去找那位青年战士的时候，他却再也找不到他了，他已经在出击中牺牲了。这更增加了王老头的疚心和悲痛，也增加了这篇小说感人的力量，这个事实给予这个老头的不仅是疚心和悲痛，而是更加积极的行动。它给予读者的也不仅感动而已。这篇东西反映了作者对战争生活的熟习丰富，氛围气也很浓重。但在结构上是欠统一的。第一人称说故事的形式和故事本身的发展是矛盾的，前者像包皮一样，却包不住这故事的内容。
    我们再换一个以爱护伤病员为主题的短篇——《堡垒》（见《人民文学》二卷三期）来考查一下。作者并没有表面地、琐碎地去描写负责看护他们的那几位同志如何的体贴备至，只在鬼子下街检查的危险当口，表现出他（她）们患难与共的伟大精神，同时从老百姓以身家性命作代价匿藏他们的行动上，从家人一样看待他们的情态上，透露出这种军民关系。从以上这两种关系上我们可以看出抗日战争所以致胜的一个重要因素来。
    《关连长》（见《人民文学》一卷三期、《新华月报》转载过）和《柳堡的故事》（见《文艺》一卷三期、《新华月报》转载过）是表现解放军新品质的两篇很突出的作品。关连长，对敌人他是猛烈的，贴身衣服的口袋里珍藏着上面写着“爸爸收”三个字的一张孩子的照片。把敌人包围在一座洋楼上，从望远镜里他发现了二楼玻璃窗上贴着一张张天真的小面孔，贴得太紧，鼻子都扁了。本来可以吊上大炮叫这座大楼和敌人一同粉碎的，但他却领着队伍去冲锋，他牺牲了。《柳堡的故事》虽然是写了一个恋爱的故事，但它决不是一篇一般的庸俗的恋爱小说。它不但写了我们的主人公李进爱了受迫害的二妹子，更重要的是他如何的爱了她。如果不是同一个阶级、同一个命运、同一个希望与斗争把他俩连起，心和心是不会打通的。他可以放弃作为爱人的她，但决不放弃作为阶级姊妹的她去搭救她。这样，个人幸福与人民的命运，在这位青年副班长身上得到了统一。一种新的高尚的品质，在爱的光辉下显现出来。这个小说的思想性和艺术性都达到了相当高度的水平。（当然，个别的、需要修正的小缺点还是存在的。）
    去年，立高发表了两篇写部队题材的小说，都是很优秀的。可是，读了《永远向着前面》（见《人民文学》二卷四、五期）以后便觉得《老营长》（见《小说》三卷三期《新华月报》转载过）虽然人物的形象栩栩动人，但和前者相较，在结构上不免缺乏一种起伏回旋的气势，在主题思想性上，也弱于前者，因为《老营长》只写出了一个战斗英雄，并没有解决一个什么问题。《永远向着前面》却提出了“经验主义”与“教条主义”在部队重要干部之间发生的斗争，从而解决了它。这两个矛盾力量的冲击严重的伤害着我们部队作战的力量。在这篇小说里，它们是以副团长马德辉、参谋长于锐为代表的。作为正面力量的李团长一出场，整个情况随着他的到来而转动起来。这个矛盾终于经过批评与自我批评而解决了。这批评与自我批评不是在会场上用口说出来的，而是战场上残酷的战斗给他们作出来的。这大开大合的结构，这矛盾统一的场面，有力地吸引着读者。这三个人物平行地被描写着，几乎确定不了谁应当是主角。一只胳膀的李团长给人的印象却更为突出，更为生动，更为丰富。这个形象，应该说是一年来文艺创作上很杰出的一个艺术形象了吧？
    部队文艺以团以上的首长为主角的很少见，刘白羽的《火光在前》在这方面是有开创意义的。去年大军渡江不久，在艺术上就得到了这样比较深入、比较大规模的反映，是可宝贵的一种努力和收获。在这个中篇里，他不仅写了师长陈兴才、政治委员梁宾，也写了团长、科长、参谋、连长、士兵和游击队。这二位师级首长执行任务的精神和克服困难的意志始终贯彻到各方面去，支配着全体的行动。虽然有时他们并不在，但我们感觉到他们在。他们的眼不但望着敌人，也望自己的部队。像一幅油画，一眼看上去，虽然觉得五光十色纷然并呈，但色调却是统一的、庄严富丽的。配合了这个伟大的场面，这篇作品有了一种向人冲击的热情和气魄。虽然作者把知识分子的感触过多一点地传染给政治委员，但没有达到损害这个形象的严肃性、坚强性的程度。
    从作者的另一个短篇——《早晨六点钟》（见一九四九年十一月十三日《人民日报》），我们可以看到中篇《火光在前》的一些影子，但它却不是它的缩写，它虽然同样也写了师长、政委……但这个短篇却把主题放在部队的“思想问题”上去，而着重地写了营长沈贵良，写了他对于一个连长陈和鸣的《露营没有住洋楼好》的那种都市影响的批判。这表明了解放军不但时时在战胜敌人，也时时在战胜自己。
    我的介绍到这里完了。这些作品是我编杂志看稿子，从个人接触到的一些材料中挑出来的。当然，有一些新的题材和主题我们的作家还没有触及到，未开垦的部队文艺的领域今天对我们说还是十分广阔的。我们已经写成作品的比战争所供给我们的，还是太少了，我们所听到的，所看到的，比我们所写到的所读到的动人得多，但我们的作家已经用他们的成绩给了我们保证：不久的将来一定会有更雄伟的大作品产生出来。
              九月十六日写，九月二十五日改写。
