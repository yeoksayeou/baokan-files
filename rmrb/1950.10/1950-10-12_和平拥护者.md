　　Peace Advocates
    Ehrenburg

    From Silence to Speech

    A year and a half ago, the *Daily Mail* wrote: "The so-called 'peace advocates' - they are nothing more than a handful of insignificant red agitators." At that time, American and pro-American newspapers talked about Mr. Truman's humanitarianism, odes to the atomic bomb, the spurs of Fontainebleau, and Luxembourg's determination to "make the Soviet Union recognize its place," as well as Tito's first bashful smile and Chiang Kai-shek's last kiss; these newspapers had space to publish all of this, but stubbornly maintained silence about the peace movement.

    Now, from any issue of any American or pro-American newspaper, one can find articles, dispatches, or cartoons opposing the Stockholm Appeal. What the *Daily Mail* contemptuously called "a handful of red agitators" has manifested as a people's movement of hundreds of millions, forcing even those who fantasize about a new war to take it seriously. Although these people control widely circulated newspapers and powerful radio stations, piles of gold and huge arsenals, they do not have, nor can they have, the support of the people.

    The real handful are not "red agitators" but bloodthirsty instigators. They have all begun to talk about the Stockholm Appeal, such as Mr. Acheson and British generals, the "British Broadcasting Corporation" and the Roman cardinals, France's Schuman and Germany's Franco, Washington's governors and Bonn's high-ranking officials, and so on. They all curse peace advocates. They originally intended to remain silent, but the situation forced them to speak. Now they must be forced to shut up.

    "Let the Communists sign their own resolutions, a sheaf of paper cannot change anything" - not long ago, the advocates of the atomic bomb, the worshipers of plague fleas, and the believers in Colorado potato beetles declared such. The French government gazette, *Le Monde*, whose sympathy for peace advocates is beyond doubt, published many articles hating the Stockholm Appeal, just like thousands of other newspapers. However, it was in *Le Monde* that I read a dispatch from Washington, which tried to explain why the Americans have not yet dropped the atomic bomb on Korea. The author wrote that the Americans have not decided to use atomic weapons because "this would create a bad impression in many countries." It seems that "a sheaf of paper" has completely turned into a practical obstacle. The voices of hundreds of millions of people living on five continents have reached Washington. Atomic fanatics and hydrogen maniacs are panicked: they understand how difficult it is to manufacture this evil weapon, and now they see that applying them is even more difficult. I am convinced that these gentlemen who love ministerial chairs have rarely paid attention to the dock. But the shadow of the Nuremberg gallows has more than once been projected onto the white walls of Washington.

    Should Not Relax, Nor Can Relax

    Peace advocates can point to the preliminary achievements of the movement; however, no one should relax or can relax regarding this achievement: the criminals did not drop the atomic bomb on Korea, but this does not mean that they will not drop the atomic bomb on Korea or other countries, if the people of all nations appear carefree; it does not mean that they will not commit any despicable crimes in this Korea, now or in the future; nor does it mean that they are no longer preparing for new wars and that unimaginable massacre - which they often call "World War III." It has been successful to restrain a fatal step of the criminals; but regarding this point, no one should, and cannot relax, because the criminals are still criminals after all - although they have been stopped, they have not yet been detained.

    Terrible events continue to be created in unfortunate Korea. The "Voice of America" calmly reports every day how many tons of explosives have been dropped on those many small cities. The horrific destruction suffered by this country, which had only recently been liberated from Japanese bondage and began to live a peaceful life, has won the approval and praise of pastors, professors, Labor Party members, diplomats, poets, and all hypocrites in the New and Old Worlds. In order to conceal the adventurers from various countries attacking this small country that threatens no one, a new type of foreign legion that steals the banner of the United Nations and bomber groups that massacre women and children have been created. The events taking place in Korea, for the Americans - are a rehearsal for a world war. Their seizure of an island in China once again proves that the appetite is getting bigger and bigger.

    In the United States, a plague of hatred of mankind continues. The Atomic Energy Commission bravely stated in its routine report to the U.S. Congress that the production of atomic bombs has reached its highest level, and work on hydrogen bombs and "poison bombs" is continuing. The magazine *Atomic Scientists* reported on a new weapon of mass destruction - "lethal sand." In the memorandum of the "Committee on European Problems," it is talked about how to use bombs, microorganisms, poisons, and pests to universally destroy humans, animals, and plants, and also about "meteorological warfare."

    I am not prepared to guess how many sinister facts and how many bloodthirsty delusions there are in these documents; I am just saying again: an upright person, no matter where he lives, should not and cannot relax! Because now those affected businessmen and rude madmen have not been monitored, they are not monitored by inspectors or psychiatrists.

    The United States is Training Executioners

    I don't know if the United States is manufacturing "poison bombs" or "lethal sand"; but I do know that the United States is training executioners, just like fifteen years ago, when Germany trained those against Lidice, against Oradour, and against Auschwitz.

    *Croix* once published a discussion between two American soldiers in MacArthur's army. Frank Blue said: "The Korean bastards should know that we hate the Soviet monkey tricks." John Marotte said more specifically: "I have to fight. I bought a car park in California, but it is best to break with the Reds now. We will eliminate them! Americans have never lost a war." I have read the diaries and letters of Hitler's soldiers, so Marotte and Blue's arrogant boasting or stupid cruelty did not surprise me - since there is such a war, there are soldiers suitable for such a war.

    The thesis on cultivating plague fleas, the telegrams from congressmen demanding the immediate use of atomic bombs, the brute force of reckless invaders like Marotte who are not smart enough to understand, and finally, the irresponsible speeches of American responsible figures - all of this has caused real panic in the United States' dependent countries. For example, in Italy, many necessities of life have disappeared. French newspapers reported that Biarritz and other resorts near the Spanish border are filled with a vulgar group - these gentlemen, who opportunely reconcile Vichy mineral water with American "Coca-Cola," are considering escaping beyond the Pyrenees. In West Germany, the list of 24,000 "senior German officials" who are preparing to retreat to Switzerland when necessary has been drafted, and panic buying has occurred in the grain stores of Frankfurt, Munich, and Kiel by anxious residents. Panic also shrouded the United States; the *Wall Street Journal* wrote: "Since 1939, the United States has never been in such a critical situation."

    Five years ago, talk about a new war was only in the offices of businessmen. Three years ago, talk about a new war was by diplomats, politicians, and journalists. Now residents are talking about the new war, in milk parlors, on suburban trains, in small restaurants, and on the streets. Five years ago, the gunfire in Greece seemed to be the last gunfire of the recently ended war. Three years ago, people listened to the gunfire in Indonesia and China confusedly, not understanding what was going on. Now, people are anxiously watching the news from Korea.

    Where does this unease come from? Why are the post-war years similar to the pre-war years? Why is everyone talking about war? No matter which country's people, they do not want war, not only in Europe, but also in the Americas, hundreds of millions of ordinary people hate war. Can this handful of unscrupulous and greedy businessmen, this handful of madmen who have been overwhelmed by greed and fear, subject all of mankind to a terrible test again? Conscience and a sense of justice have been aroused. The World Peace Movement - this is the greatest, most natural, and most just expression of the uneasiness, anger, and hope of hundreds of millions of ordinary people. This movement is growing month by month and day by day. Now we are under a new upsurge of this movement, this new upsurge is caused by the Korean War, the expansion of armaments, and world frenzy.

    The Second and Great Task

    The Second World Peace Congress will be held in London in November. The peace advocates chose this city for the conference, not only to express their trust in the hospitable traditions of the British people, but also to express their confidence in the British people's deep love of peace. We know how closely many rulers of Britain have linked their fate to that of the Washington aggressors, and we also know that the thoughtful workers and the British Scottish miners, the workers of Manchester or Birmingham, and the Cambridge university students, who have thousands of years of culture, have nothing in common with the American robbers.

    The American robbers boast of the loot in their pockets - even boasting to Taiwan, Greenland, the "Magna Carta," and the ancient culture of Europe. Not long ago, the peace movement in Britain was narrow, more like a religious movement than a passion of the people. Now the nature of this movement has changed, expanded, and absorbed the most famous scholars and the working class - what is being talked about is no longer defending any dogma, but defending one of the oldest countries in Europe from barbaric destruction.

    The Second Congress will explain how the movement to defend peace has grown up in other countries. American and pro-American newspapers continue to frivolously call this movement a "communist movement," thus gifting the Communists with the hundreds of millions of people who signed the Stockholm Appeal. However, it is enough to point out some names, such as former Italian Prime Ministers Orlando, Nitti, Bono, French celebrities Gouda, Aragon, Dabis, Levy, etc., to understand that the political scale of the movement to defend peace includes British conservatives, Swedish social democrats, and French Catholics; this is not a political party, this is a union of people with all kinds of different ideas, an alliance of patriots from all countries, and a group founded to prevent war. Italian Communists and Mr. Bono continue to argue outside the peace movement. French Communists are able to disagree with this or that assertion of Mr. Aragon in Congress.

    However, the unity of the Communists with people of various viewpoints and other parties to defend peace is a very clear and most important thing. For the Communists, war is a disaster, and for those who oppose communism and are willing to defend their ideas without weapons, but with language or creative labor, war is also the greatest disaster. The movement to defend peace should grow, because people's awareness, responsibility to children, and people's anger are growing. The Second Congress will issue a serious warning to those greedy people who have brought poverty, unease, and terror to mankind, and are planning to bring millions of Hiroshimas, new Auschwitzes, blood, ruins, despair, and wastelands to mankind.

    The Stockholm Appeal calls for a ban on atomic weapons. Mr. Acheson and his senior officials stationed in Europe have hypocritically asked: "Why do peace advocates oppose the atomic bomb, but not talk about other weapons?" American and pro-American newspapers all want to convince others that banning atomic weapons is beneficial to the Soviet Union and not beneficial to the United States. This is nonsense, because the monopoly of atomic weapons has long ceased to exist (in the United States, only the monopoly of the unreasoned eulogy of this weapon remains). This is absurd delirium, because at any time, any place, any bomb cannot determine the outcome of the war. The question of atomic weapons is not a question between the United States and the Soviet Union, but a question between bombs and people.

    Demanding a Ban on Atomic Bombs is the First Step

    Peace advocates first demand a ban on atomic weapons, simply because the atomic bomb is the most hateful weapon of mass slaughter of people. Demanding a ban on atomic bombs is the first step, without taking this first step, you cannot get through this road, this is also very clear in the hearts of the hypocrites. However, peace advocates never want to stop after taking the first step. We are against the atomic bomb, we are never advocates of ordinary bombs, tanks, or mortars, we have been and are peace advocates.

    At its recent meeting, the Standing Committee of the Executive Bureau raised the issue of universal disarmament. Of course, the Second Congress will discuss this issue. In this way, the threat of war can be eased, and people all over the world can live easier. The residents of Saint-Nazaire living in cold huts, the residents of London drinking unsweetened tea, and the residents of Naples fantasizing about plates full of macaroni, are all because of the expansion of armaments everywhere. Hypocrites say: "You are against the atomic bomb, but the Russians have many tanks, why don't you oppose them?" Peace advocates are going to discuss universal disarmament - whether it is the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and other countries.

    Hypocrites are trying to convince people that peace advocates only condemn this or that weapon, but do not want to condemn war, and list those who incite war as war criminals. Hypocrites prefer to blame aggression, apparently forgetting that they are clumsily discussing the rope in the gallows. I do not want to argue with these liars who are trying to say that the American invasion of Korea is to protect the Koreans from aggression. The whole world sees how brave American pilots protect Korean women. Although simple people do not know the provisions of those international laws that hypocrites cite in vain, simple people are very clear that the Koreans did not land in San Francisco, did not bomb Chicago, nor did they bomb Philadelphia. Simple people also know that the Chinese have not seized California or Oregon. While hypocritically blaming aggression, the Americans snatched Taiwan like a thief stealing an apple from a plate. The Second World Peace Congress should loudly declare that every nation has the right to live according to its own way of life, and no other nation should interfere in its internal affairs.

    Not long ago, American legal scholar Mr. Roher hoped to explain to me why some American progressives sometimes call the attacker the aggressor, and sometimes call the victim the aggressor. He detailed a lawsuit handled by Lincoln. Once, Lincoln, as the defense, won the lawsuit, but in the evening, he appeared in court again and sued on behalf of the person he opposed in the morning. I replied to Mr. Roher that Lincoln might have done this, because this lawsuit concerned the dubious demands of two litigious people on a small piece of land, but if it came to the choice between freedom and slavery, then Lincoln would unhesitatingly dedicate his life to freedom. What is now being talked about is not the lawsuit of "Mobil Corporation" against what company, but the duel between free people and the colonizers who insist on enslaving them. Therefore, every peace advocate in the United States, just like other countries, should oppose the violent with all their strength.

    Drawing up a List of War Criminals

    There is no doubt that the Second Congress will support Curie's proposal and condemn those affected businessmen and idiots who are calling for mankind to enter a new war. There are not many of these brutal people, but they have many newspapers and radio stations, and their wild barking can be heard everywhere. The wind should be suppressed first, to prevent the storm from attacking. If the signatures on the Stockholm Appeal are collected together, these tons of paper cannot be accommodated even by the tallest skyscraper. But if a list of warmongers, which is much smaller in scale, is to be drawn up, perhaps now is the time. This should be the list of war criminals for the future international court. The names of those haters of mankind who signed the memorandum of the "Committee on European Problems" should be listed on this list; let the people of the whole world know who proposed to suffocate children with poison gas, spread cholera bacteria in cities, and pour poison in wells and wheat ears. The names of those political activists and journalists who firmly advocate the immediate use of atomic bombs or "preemptive strikes" are also on the list of war criminals.

    As for those who generally love atomic weapons, as long as they think about the Stockholm Appeal, then, under the severe warning of the peace advocates, those who make eloquent speeches will have to open their mouths and stammer, and those who are journalists will not be able to justify themselves.

    In the past year, I have been to many countries; people in various countries live in various styles. The house of a Swedish mechanic is different from the hut of an Italian winemaker, and each nation has its own quirks, songs, and colors. Wherever I have been, whether in noisy and foggy London, or in a small mountain house in Switzerland - people have heard the rumors of a new war in horror. Stonemasons know how difficult it is to build houses. Horticulturists know how hard it is to plant apple trees. Women know how much mental and physical labor it takes to raise children. People of all countries - Russians and Americans, French and Chinese, British and Italians - work, not to turn houses into ruins, to make apple trees fall down, not to make a piece of metal cast into a regretful thing - to make the hearts of those young people, the hearts of children, who might become new Tolstoys, new Newtons, new Marxes, stop beating, according to the violent orders of crazy big merchants.

    In August, *Croix* published a questionnaire: "Do you believe there is a possibility of a recent war?" Polly, Renault, and Flanti, people who have stirred up France into a mess, replied ecstatically: "Yes."

    But in addition to a few people who love war, there are hundreds of millions of peace advocates, who will not allow cruel killings.

### 和平拥护者
爱伦堡
1950-10-12
第5版()
专栏：

　　和平拥护者
    爱伦堡
    从沉默到开口
    一年半以前，《每日邮报》写道：“所谓‘和平拥护者’——这不过是一小撮不足挂齿的赤色煽动分子而已”。那时候，美国的和亲美的报纸上所谈论的是杜鲁门先生的人道主义，原子弹的诗句，封腾布罗（注一）的马刺声和卢森堡“让苏联认清自己的地位”的决心，以及铁托第一次含羞的微笑和蒋介石最后的飞吻；这些报纸有地位刊登这一切，但是对于拥护和平运动却顽固地保持着沉默。
    现在，从任何一种美国的或亲美的报纸的任何一期上，都能够发现反对斯德哥尔摩宣言的文章、通讯或是漫画。《每日邮报》轻蔑地称做“一小撮赤色煽动分子”的、已表现为数以亿万计的人民运动，也就使幻想着新战争的人们也不得不予以重视。这些人虽然控制了销路很广的报纸和强有力的广播电台，成堆的金子和巨大的兵工厂，但是他们却没有，也不可能有人民的支持。
    真正的一小撮并不是“赤色煽动分子”而是嗜血的煽动者们。他们全都开始谈起斯德哥尔摩宣言来，例如艾奇逊先生和英国的将军们，“英国广播公司”和罗马的枢机主教，法——德的舒曼和德——美的佛朗哥，华盛顿的州长和波恩的高级官员等等。他们全都诅咒和平拥护者。他们本来是打算沉默的，但情势迫得他们说了话。现在可就必须迫使他们停嘴了。
    “让共产党在他们自己的决议上签名吧，一束纸片是不能改变什么的”——不久以前，原子弹的拥护者、鼠疫蚤的崇拜者和科罗拉多马铃薯害虫（注二）的信奉者们下了这样的断语。法国政府机关报《世界报》对和平拥护者的同情是没有人不怀疑的，这报正像其他数千种报纸一样，刊载过许多憎恨斯德哥尔摩宣言的文章。然而，正是在《世界报》上，我读到了一篇华盛顿通讯，其中力图解释为什么美国人到现在还不向朝鲜投掷原子弹。作者写道，美国人没有决定使用原子武器，是因为“这在许多国家中，会产生不良的印象”。这样看来，“一束纸片”完全变成了实际的障碍了。住在五大洲的亿万人民的呼声，已传到了华盛顿。原子迷信者和氢气狂人慌乱了：他们懂得制造这凶恶的武器如何困难，现在他们又看到应用它们更加困难。我确信着这些酷爱部长交椅的绅士们还很少注意到被告席。但纽伦堡绞刑台的阴影却已不只一次地映射在华盛顿的白色墙壁上了。
    不应该放心，也不能放心
    和平拥护者可以指出运动的初步成就；然而对于这个成就，谁也还不应该放心，同时也不能放心：罪犯们没有向朝鲜投掷原子弹，但这并不是说他们不向朝鲜或其他国家投原子弹了，如果各族人民表现得无忧无虑的话；这并不是说，他们在这个朝鲜，现在或将来都不会制造什么卑鄙的罪行；这也不是说，他们不再准备新的战争和那难以想像的大屠杀——就是他们经常所说的“第三次世界大战”。把罪犯们的一个宿命的步骤抑制住是成功了；可是对于这一点，谁也还不应该，同时也不能放心，因为罪犯毕竟还是罪犯——虽然阻止住了他们，可也还没有扣留住他们。
    可怕的事件继续在不幸的朝鲜制造着。“美国之音”的播音机每天泰然地报告着，多少吨炸药投到了那许多小城市中。不久以前才从日本的羁绊下解放出来而开始过着和平生活的这个国家所遭受的可怖的毁坏，博得了新旧大陆的牧师，教授，工党党员，外交家，诗人和一切伪君子的同意与赞扬。为了掩饰各国冒险家对这个谁也威胁不着的不大的国家的进攻，一种盗用联合国旗帜的新型的外国军团和残杀妇孺的轰炸机群被创造出来。在朝鲜进行着的事件，对于美国人来说——是世界大战的试演。他们对中国的一个海岛的强占再一次证明着胃口是愈来愈大了。
    在美国，一种憎恨人类的流行症继续着。原子能委员会在给美国国会的例行报告中勇敢地说道，原子弹的生产已经达到了最高水平，同时从事氢弹和“毒药炸弹”的工作正在继续中。《原子科学家》杂志报道着关于新的大量毁灭性武器——“致命沙”的事。在“欧洲问题研究委员会”的备忘录中，谈到怎样利用炸弹、微生物、毒药和害虫普遍地毁灭人畜和植物，同时还谈到“气象战争”。
    这些文件中有着多少阴凄的事实和多少嗜血的妄想，我现在并不预备加以猜测；我只是再说一遍：一个正直的人，无论住在什么地方总不应该放心同时也不能够放心！因为现在那些装痴的事业家和粗暴的狂人都并没有被监视起来，被检查官或是精神病医生监视起来。
    美国训练着刽子手
    我不知道，美国是否正在制造“毒药炸弹”或“致命沙”；但是我却知道美国正在训练刽子手，正像十五年以前，在德国训练过那些对付利台斯，对付奥拉都尔和对付奥斯文兴的人一样。
    《十字报》曾经刊载了麦克阿瑟军队中两个美国兵的议论。福兰克·布鲁说：“应该让朝鲜杂种们知道，我们是讨厌苏联猴子的把戏的”。约翰·玛克罗特则说得更加具体：“我不得不作战。我在加里福尼亚买了一个汽车场，但是最好现在和赤色分子决裂。我们会消灭他们的！美国人从来没有打过败仗”。我读到过希特勒的士兵的日记和信件，因此玛克罗特和布鲁的狂妄的吹牛或愚蠢的残忍并没有使我惊奇——既然有了这样的战争，也就有着适于这种战争的士兵。
    关于培植鼠疫蚤的论文，国会议员们要求立即应用原子弹的电报，如玛罗克特之流，不聪明的碰得头破血流的侵略分子的蛮劲，最后，还有美国负责人物的不负责任的演讲——这一切在美国的附庸国家中产生了真正的慌乱。例如，在意大利，许多生活必需品都不见了。法国报纸报道说，比亚利兹和靠近西班牙边境的其他疗养地住满着庸俗的一群——这些拿美国的“可口可乐”应时地挽和着维琪的矿泉水来喝的先生们，正在考虑着逃到卑利牛斯山外去。在西德，准备必要时向瑞士撤退的二万四千名“德国高级官员”的名单已经拟定了，而法兰克福，慕尼黑和基尔的粮食店则发生了惊慌的居民的抢购风潮。慌乱也笼罩了美国；《华尔街日报》写道：“从一九三九年以来，美国从未有过这样危急的情况”。
    五年以前，关于新战争的谈论，还只是在事业家的办公室里。三年以前，谈论新战争的有外交家、政客和记者们。现在居民们都谈论着新战争，在牛奶房里、在郊外的列车里、在小饭铺里、在大街上。五年以前，希腊的枪声似乎是刚结束的战争的最后枪声了。三年以前，人们困惑地倾听着印尼和中国的枪声，不了解这是怎么回事。现在，人们忧虑地注视着朝鲜的消息。
    这种不安是从那儿来的呢？为什么战后的年代与战前相似呢？为什么大家都谈论着战争？无论那一国人民都不愿战争，不只在欧洲，在美洲也一样，亿万普通人民都憎恨着战争。难道这一小撮丧心病狂的贪婪的事业家，因贪欲和恐惧而冲昏了头脑的这一小撮狂人，能够使全人类再遭受可怕的考验吗？良心和正义感激发起来了。世界拥护和平运动——这是亿万普通人民的不安、愤怒和希望的最伟大、最自然、最正义的表现。这个运动逐月逐日地增长着。现在我们处在这个运动的新高潮之下，这个新高潮是朝鲜战争、扩张军备和世界狂热病所引起的。
    第二次和大的任务
    第二次世界保卫和平大会将于十一月在伦敦召开。和平拥护者给大会选择了这个城市，不仅表示出对英国人好客传统的信任，而且表现出对英国人民深爱和平的信心。我们知道，英国的许多统治者把自己的命运和华盛顿侵略者的命运联系得多么紧，同时我们也知道，富于思想性的劳动，而有数千年文化的英国苏格兰的矿工，曼彻斯特或北明翰的工人，剑桥的大学生是与美国强盗们毫无任何共同之处的。
    美国强盗们夸耀着他们口袋中的掠夺品——甚而至于夸耀到台湾、格尔兰、“大宪章”和欧洲的古文化。不久以前，拥护和平运动在英国还是狭隘的，与其说是人民的激情，不如说更像是一种宗教运动。现在这个运动的性质变了，扩大了，吸收了最著名的学者和工人阶级——所谈论的已不是保卫什么教理，而是保卫欧洲最古老的国家之一，免于野蛮的毁坏。
    第二次大会将说明，保卫和平运动在其他各国怎样成长起来。美国的和亲美的报纸继续轻率地称呼这个运动为“共产党的运动”，这样，他们把斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的亿万人民赠与了共产党人。但是，只须指出一些名字，如意大利前任首相奥兰多、尼蒂、波诺米，法国的名人古达、阿拉贡、达比斯、李维等等就足以明白保卫和平运动的政治规模，是把英国保守党员、瑞典社会民主党人和法国天主教徒都包括进去的；这不是一个政党，这是具有各种不同思想的人们的联合，各国爱国志士的同盟，为防止战争而创立的团体。意大利共产党员与波诺米先生在拥护和平运动之外，还是继续着争辩。法国共产党员是能够在国会里不同意于阿拉贡先生的这个或那个论断的。
    但是，共产党人与各种观点的人及其他党派的团结保卫和平，是非常简明而又最重要的事情。对于共产党人来说，战争是一种祸害，同时对于反对共产主义，可也愿意不用武器而用语言或创造性劳动保卫自己思想的人来说，战争也是最大的祸害。拥护和平运动应当增长，因为人们的意识，对孩子的责任感和人民的愤怒都是增长着。第二次大会要向那些贪婪的人们下严重的警告，他们已经给人类带来了穷困、不安和恐怖，正在打算给人类带来成百万的广岛，新的奥斯文兴，鲜血，废墟，绝望和荒原。
    斯德哥尔摩宣言要求禁止原子武器。艾奇逊先生和他的驻在欧洲的高级官员们曾虚伪地问道：“为什么和平拥护者反对原子弹，而不谈其他的武器呢？”美国的和亲美的报纸都想使别人确信，禁止原子武器有利于苏联而不利于美国。这是无稽之谈，因为原子武器的垄断早已不存在了（在美国只剩下了毫无道理的对这个武器歌颂事业的垄断）。这是荒诞的呓语，因为任何时候，任何地点，任何炸弹都不能决定战争的结果。原子武器的问题并不是美国与苏联两方面的问题，而是炸弹与人两方面的问题。
    要求禁止原子弹是第一步
    和平拥护者首先要求禁止原子武器，只是因为原子弹是最可憎恶的大规模屠杀人民的武器。要求禁止原子弹是第一步，不走这第一步，就不能走通这条路，这在伪善者们心里也是十分明白的。但是，和平拥护者任何时候都不想走了第一步就停留下来。我们反对原子弹，我们任何时候都不是普通炸弹、坦克或迫击炮的拥护者，我们过去和现在都是和平拥护者。
    常设委员会执行局在最近一次会议上，曾提出了关于普遍裁减军备问题。当然，第二次大会要讨论这个问题。这么一来，战争的威胁可以缓和，全世界的人们也可以生活得容易些。圣那最尔（注三）居民安身于寒冷的茅屋，伦敦的居民喝着无糖的茶，那不勒斯（注四）的居民幻想着盛满通心面的碟子，这都是因为军备到处扩张的缘故。伪善者们说：“你们反对原子弹，但是俄国人有许多坦克，你们为什么不反对呢？”和平拥护者是要讨论普遍裁减军备的——不论美国、苏联、英国、法国及其他各国。
    伪善者们竭力想使人们相信：和平拥护者们单只斥责这种或那种武器，而不想谴责战争，并把那些掀起战争的人列为战争罪犯。伪善者们偏喜欢责备侵略，显然忘记了自己正在绞刑房里笨拙地议论着绳子。我现在不愿与这些企图把美国侵入朝鲜硬说成保护朝鲜人免于侵略的骗子们来争辩。全世界的人都看到，勇敢的美国飞行员如何保护朝鲜妇女。纯朴的人们尽管不知道伪善者们白费气力地所引用的那些国际公法条文，但是纯朴的人们都非常明白，朝鲜人没有在旧金山登陆，没有轰炸芝加哥，也没有轰炸费城。纯朴的人们又都知道，中国人没有强占加里福尼亚或俄勒冈。美国人一面伪善地责备着侵略，一面又像小偷顺手偷了碟子上的一个苹果似的把台湾攫去了。第二次世界保卫和平大会应当大声宣布，每一民族都有按自己生活方式生活的权利，不容其他民族干涉其内部事务。
    不久以前，美国法律学家罗赫先生希望向我解释一番，为什么某些美国进步人士时而称攻击者为侵略者，时而又称受害者为侵略者。他把林肯经办的一件讼案详说了一下。有一次林肯作辩护的一方获了胜诉，但到晚上，他又在法院出现，并替他早上所反对的那个人起诉了。我回答罗赫先生说，林肯是也许会这样做的，因为这讼案关涉着小块土地上两个好讼者的可疑的要求，但如果谈到自由与奴隶之间的选择，那么林肯就会毫不踌躇地把生命献给自由的。现在所谈的不是“美孚公司”对什么公司的诉讼，而是自由的人民对硬要奴役他们的殖民者的决斗。因此，美国的每一个和平拥护者，正同其他国家一样，应当以全力反对强暴者。
    开列战犯的名单
    毫无疑问，第二次大会，将支持居里的建议，并谴责那些号召人类进入新战争的事业家和白痴们。这些残暴者并不怎么多，但是他们手下有许多报纸和电台，他们的狂吠到处听得见。应该先把风势压制下去，防免风暴的袭来。如果把斯德哥尔摩宣言的签名书征集在一起，这数以吨计的纸张就连最高的摩天楼也容纳不下。但是如果要把规模远小于此的好战者名单开列出来，现在也许是时候了。这该是将来国际法庭的战犯名单吧。凡在“欧洲问题研究委员会”的备忘录上签了名的人类憎恨者们的名字都应当开列在这名单里；叫全世界的人知道，谁建议着用毒气来窒息孩子们，把虎列拉菌散布在城市上，把毒药洒在井里和麦穗上。战犯的名单中也有那些坚决主张立刻使用原子弹或“先发制人”的政治活动家和新闻记者的名字。
    至于一般爱好原子武器的人们只要对斯德哥尔摩宣言想一想，那么，在和平拥护者们的严厉警告之下，做雄辩家的就不得不张口结舌，做新闻记者的就不能自圆其说了。
    在最近一年中，我曾到过许多国家；各国人民过着各种样式的生活。瑞典机械师的房子是不同于意大利酿酒者的茅屋的，各个民族都有自己的癖好，歌曲和颜色。凡是我所到过的地方，不论在喧嚣的多雾的伦敦，或在瑞士的小山屋——人们都惊恐地听到关于新战争的谣言。石匠知道，建造房屋是多么困难。园艺家知道，栽植苹果树是多么辛苦。妇女知道，养育孩子们是多么劳心费神。各国的人们——俄国人和美国人，法国人和中国人，英国人和意大利人——劳动着，并不是为了按照疯狂的大商人的狂暴的命令，要使房屋变成废墟，要使苹果树倒下来，并不是为了要使一块金属铸成抱憾的事情——使那些或许能够成为新的托尔斯泰，新的牛顿，新的马克思的青年们的心，孩子们的心停止跳动。
    在八月里，《十字报》登载了这样一个调查表：“你相信最近有战争的可能性吗？”波利，雷诺，法兰第之流，把法国搅得一团糟的人们，狂喜地回答说：“是的”。
    但是除去少数爱好战争的人以外，还有亿万和平拥护者，他们是不允许残酷的杀戮的。
