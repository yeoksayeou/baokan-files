　　Jinzhou's Third Quarter Rectification Concludes
    Relevant Departments Seriously Improve Work
    [This newspaper reported] The third quarter rectification work in Jinzhou concluded at the end of September. The rectification of cadres above the county level in the Party Group of the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government, as well as the Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, Health, and Taxation Bureaus, state-owned and public-owned enterprises, and the General Trade Union, along with relevant responsible cadres in these departments, has been basically completed. Other departments will carry out rectification in the fourth quarter.

    During this rectification, each unit generally focused on examining the key issues of their own unit and promptly formulated specific methods for improving work. As a result, significant improvements have been made in their work. First, factories and enterprises prioritized operational management. In the past, factories and enterprises did not pay enough attention to operational management and lacked experience in capital management, resulting in the accumulation of working capital and affecting the development of production. For example, the construction company hoarded a large amount of raw materials, buying whenever there was a bargain. When glass prices fell to 1.9 million yuan per case, the company quickly bought 210 cases. Who knew that the price of glass would continue to fall to 1.5 million yuan per case later on. After the rectification, each factory and enterprise department first prioritized operational management, clarified the concept of economic accounting, and grasped the key points of production. The Post and Telecommunications Bureau used to think that economic accounting was the responsibility of the finance department, only paying attention to saving daily necessities, even strictly reviewing the use of a single thumbtack, while ignoring capital management. Now, they have reversed their previous one-sided and narrow view, facing production and combining it with a depreciation survey of materials, re-sorting materials, and laying the foundation for accurate cost accounting. The paper mill strengthened its sales work during the rectification, establishing 45 agency relationships outside the city. In July and August, work was able to calculate costs in advance and make accurate budgets. Second, the spirit of democratic management and the policy of uniting technical personnel were implemented. Those in leadership positions with poor democratic style have begun to change their style. The factory management committee has also played a role. In the past, the Enterprise Management Committee of the Post and Telecommunications Bureau had 17 members, only two of whom were workers. Moreover, the management committee mainly handled daily trivial matters and could not become the core of leading production. Now it has changed. The Enterprise Management Committee of the Post and Telecommunications Bureau has broken away from the circle of affairs, focusing on discussing and studying production plans, and handing over the plans to workers for discussion and implementation. This has improved the workers' production enthusiasm, and as a result, a month's plan was completed in 11 days, exceeding it by 10 percent. In terms of uniting technical personnel, there used to be tendencies of unprincipled accommodation and closed-doorism. For example, in order to unite technical personnel, a branch of a unit even showed Party documents to non-Party technical personnel. Jinzhou Engineering Company feared that technical personnel would leave, so it increased their salary points without principle. Some units believed that most technical personnel had blemishes and therefore dared not approach them. This erroneous thinking was criticized during the rectification, and the correct policy was implemented. Attention was paid to uniting them through production and strengthening education to raise awareness. For example, the Municipal Telephone Bureau correctly implemented the policy of unity, so the two technical personnel invited from Guangdong were unwilling to return, and they worked actively, taking the initiative to translate the names on the machines into Chinese and teach them to the workers. Third, production quality was improved, costs were reduced, and an inspection and acceptance system was established. Kaiming Company formulated a top-down inspection system and inspection organization, stipulated quality standards, and implemented a reward system. The quality of products has increased by 20 percent. In the past, there was a lot of waste of materials in production, and quotas were not accurate. After the rectification, the Party, government, labor union, and youth league changed their past style, going deep into the site to experiment with quotas. In September, the amount of coal needed for 10,000 bricks was reduced from 1.3 tons to 1.15 tons. The ceramics factory used to have a purely task-oriented view, emphasizing production quantity and neglecting quality. During the rectification, they found the crux of the problem in production and changed the business policy from increasing quantity to improving quality. The factory previously had no first-class bowls, but now it does; second-class bowls also increased from 35 percent to 68.7 percent, and third-class bowls decreased from 61 percent to 27.4 percent, with a significant improvement in quality. Second, in terms of commercial work, the business direction was clarified. The four major state-owned companies checked and changed the shortcomings of unclear business directions and incomplete plans, and strengthened the connection between each other. The Trust Company strengthened the view of serving industry. In the past, the company focused on the management of grain. The total turnover in the first half of 1950 was 40,329.749 billion yuan, of which agricultural products accounted for 93.2 percent and industrial products only accounted for 6.8 percent. It did not play a role in helping industry. Now, the company has specially set up an industrial service section, specializing in researching the products and raw materials needed by various public and private industries, so as to purchase and sell them in time. Third, the policies were straightened out. The Taxation Bureau found that the long-term sealing of merchants' goods hindered commercial development, so they immediately corrected the phenomenon of sealing goods and accounts, and clarified the policy thinking of taking into account both public and private interests. Fourth, the leadership style was improved, and the ideological level of cadres was raised. After the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions checked that it had not done enough in facing production, it decided to seize the main links of work, concentrate its efforts, do a good job in production, go deep into the factories, and specifically help solve the difficulties in the production of each factory.

　　锦州第三季度整风结束
    有关部门认真改进工作
    【本报讯】锦州第三季度整风工作，已于九月底结束。基本上完成了市委、市府党组及民、财、教、卫、税务等局及国公营企业、总工会等部门县级以上干部与各该部门有关的较负责干部的整风。其他各部门将在第四季度进行。
    在这次整风当中，各单位一般均能抓住本单位关键性问题进行检查，并及时制订改进工作的具体办法，因此工作上已有显著改进。一、工厂企业首先是重视了经营管理。过去工厂企业对经营管理重视不够，缺乏资金管理经验，因此积压流动资金，影响生产的发展。例如建筑公司大量储备原料，有便宜货就买。在玻璃跌价到一百九十万元一箱时，该公司赶快买进二百一十箱。谁知后来玻璃价格一直落到一百五十万一箱。经过整风后，各工厂企业部门首先重视了经营管理工作，明确了经济核算观念，抓到了生产当中的要害。邮电局过去认为经济核算是财政科的事，只注意节省日常用品，甚至使用一个大头针也要严格审核，而对资金管理则不注意。现在扭转了以前片面的狭隘的观点，面向了生产，并结合资材折旧调查，重新清理资材，给精确的成本核算打下基础。造纸厂在整风中加强了推销工作，在城外建立了四十五家代销关系，七、八月份工作能提前计算成本作出精确预算。其次是贯彻了民主管理精神与团结技术人员的政策，领导上民主作风较差的已开始改变作风。工厂管委会也起了作用，过去邮电局的企业管理委员会委员十七人，其中只有两个工人。并且管委会主要处理了日常琐事，不能成为领导生产的核心。现在改变了，邮电局企业管委会摆脱了事务圈子，着重讨论研究生产计划，并将计划交给工人讨论执行，这样工人生产情绪提高，结果一个月的计划十一天就完成了，并超过了百分之十。在团结技术人员方面，过去存在着无原则迁就与关门主义偏向，如某单位支部为要团结技术人员，竟把党内文件拿给非党技术人员看。锦州工程公司怕技术人员走，无原则的给他们增加薪金分数。有的单位认为技术人员有污点的多，因此不敢接近。整风中批判了这种错误思想，正确的贯彻了政策。注意了从生产中、从加强教育提高觉悟中去团结他们。如市报话局正确地执行了团结政策，所以由广东请来的两个技术人员便不愿回去，并且工作积极，主动地把机器上的名字译成中文教给工人。第三、提高了生产质量，减低了成本，建立了检收制度。开明公司制订了自上而下的检查制度与检查组织，规定了质量标准，实行奖励制度，产品质量已提高百分之二十。过去生产中材料上浪费很大，定额不精确。经过整风，党、政、工、团改变了过去的作风，深入现场试验定额，九月份已从一万块砖需用一·三吨煤，降到一·一五吨煤。陶瓷厂过去存在单纯任务观点，强调生产数量，忽视质量。整风中找到生产中的症结，改变了经营方针，由增加数量转为提高质量。该厂以前没有一等碗，现在有了；二等碗也由百分之三十五增到百分之六八·七，三等碗由百分之六一降到百分之二七·四，质量显著提高。二、在商业工作方面明确了业务方针，国营四大公司，检查与改变了业务方针不明确与计划不周到的缺点，互相间加强了联系。信托公司加强了为工业服务的观点。过去该公司着重经营粮食，一九五○年上半年成交总额四○、三二九、七四九亿元，其中农业产品占百分之九三·二，工业产品仅占百分之六·八。没有起了帮助工业的作用。现在该公司特增设工业服务股，专门从事研究各公私工业需要的产品与原料，以便及时代为购销。三、端正了政策，税务局检查出长期封锁商人的货物，有碍商业发展，便立即纠正封货封账现象，明确了公私兼顾的政策思想。四、改善了领导作风，提高了干部思想水平。市总工会检查出面向生产作得不够后，即决定抓住工作主要环节，集中力量，搞好生产，深入工厂，具体帮助解决各厂生产中的困难。
