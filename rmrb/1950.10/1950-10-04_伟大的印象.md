　　A Great Impression
　　Luo Binji

　　As an observer at the National Conference of Combat Heroes and Model Workers, I am happy.

　　If I were a poet, I would be unable to resist singing praises, praising the glorious century that our combat heroes have opened up for us under the banner of Mao Zedong, praising the solid foundation that our model workers have established for the society of our century.

　　In the three days of typical reports by the combat heroes, I saw the noble and great qualities of the revolutionary soldiers led by the working class, piled up as solemnly as mountain peaks, and arranged as upright as towering ridges.

　　We are just like walking into the strange peaks and dangerous cliffs of this spiritual mountain range, sometimes even climbing to the top of these strange peaks, looking out more broadly.

　　These noble and great qualities of revolutionary soldiers of the working class are the treasures of the Chinese nation and all mankind, and we have every reason to be proud of them.

　　These noble and great qualities of revolutionary soldiers are cultivated by Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought. They are composed of the fearless spirit of defending the Chinese working people and the territory of the Chinese working people, and of the infinite loyalty to the Chinese working people and their territory. A spirit of fortitude rises from these mountain peaks, and wisdom shines everywhere like sunlight.

　　The people's combat hero Lü Shunbao is an example: In the entanglement of enemies surrounding him, he rolled down from the top of the mountain, and five enemies rolled down with him at the same time. He still held tightly the heavy machine gun seized from the enemy until he was stopped by the trees and his leg was injured by the mountain rocks. As soon as he woke up from the coma, he picked up a stone on the spot and smashed two enemies to death. But for the old woman sitting alone in that deserted village, he showed his love so purely, and for the comrade who was sick and could not spit out phlegm, he used his own mouth to suck it out for him. A high degree of love and hate are combined, and clearly distinguished. On the one hand, there is hatred and a strong and fearless spirit, and on the other hand, there is a pure, kind, and solemn heart.

　　Listening to the report of the female tractor driver Liang Jun, I felt like I had walked from the majestic peaks to the March plains. She said: One night, when she came back from work, it was raining heavily and she was soaked all over. When she and Wu Yuzhen returned to the shack, the house was also leaking, so they rolled up their bedding and sat underneath it, and the two of them began to sing. They were rained on all night, and as soon as it dawned, they started the tractor. As soon as the sun came out, their clothes slowly dried. They are working with such a joyful kind of anticipation. Just like she said at the Heilongjiang Provincial Youth League Congress: "Comrades! I am one of you. Your ideal career is my ideal career. Let us give off a bit of heat and a bit of light for a beautiful cause and a beautiful life!"

　　This is the best example for our young generation.

　　The lofty and great mountains formed by the combat heroes are precisely the solid barriers of this March plain. Undoubtedly, thousands upon thousands of Liang Juns will emerge on the plains protected by these strange peaks and towering ridges, making the foundation of our country even more solid.

　　伟大的印象
    骆宾基
    作为一个全国战斗英雄和劳动模范代表会议的旁听者，我是幸福的。
    假若是诗人，他将情不自禁的歌颂，歌颂我们的战斗英雄在毛泽东旗帜下给我们开辟的这个光辉的世纪，歌颂我们的劳动模范为我们这个世纪的社会建立了坚固的基础。
    在战斗英雄们的三天典型报告中，我看见工人阶级所领导的革命军人的崇高而伟大的品质，像山峰那样庄严地堆积起来，像峻岭那样挺拔地排列起来。
    我们正像走进这精神山脉的奇峰危崖，有时还攀登到这些奇峰之巅，更广阔地了望开去。
    这崇高而伟大的工人阶级革命军人的品质，是我们中华民族、全世界人类的珍宝，我们完全有理由可以自豪的。
    这崇高而伟大的革命军人的品质，是为马列主义——毛泽东思想所培育起来的。是由卫护中国劳动人民、卫护中国劳动人民的国土的大无畏精神所构成的，是由对于中国劳动人民及其国土的无限忠贞所构成的。刚毅之气从这些山峰间升发出来，智慧就像阳光一样到处闪射着。
    人民的战斗英雄吕顺保就是一个例子：他在敌人环绕的纠缠中，从山顶上滚下来，五个敌人和他同时滚下来，他还紧紧抱着夺自敌人的重机枪，直到为树木所阻，腿部被山石所伤。一从昏迷中醒过来，又就地搬起石块砸死两个敌人。但对于那荒村中独自呆坐的老大娘，他又是那么纯朴的现出他的爱来，对于患病吐不出痰来的战友，用自己的嘴替他吸取出来。高度的爱和恨结合着，又明确的划分开来。一方面是仇恨心和坚强无畏的气魄，一方面是纯朴善良的庄严的心胸。
    听到女拖拉机手梁军的报告，我又像从雄伟的群峰间走到了三月的原野一样。她说：有一天夜晚工作回来，雨很大，满身都湿了。和吴玉珍回到窝棚，屋子也漏了，就卷起铺盖，坐在底下，两个人唱起歌来。淋了一夜雨，天一亮，就开起拖拉机，太阳一出来，衣裳就慢慢地晒干了。她们是怀着多么愉快的一种憧憬工作着。正像她在黑龙江省青年团代表会上所说的：“同志们！我是你们当中的一个，你们的理想事业，就是我的理想事业，让我们为美好事业，美好生活，有一分热发一分光吧！”
    这是我们年轻一代的最好的榜样。
    那些由战斗英雄们所构成的崇高而伟大的山峰，正是这三月原野的坚固屏围，在这些奇峰峻岭围护下的原野上，无疑地将涌现出千千万万的梁军，使我们国家的基础更加巩固起来。
