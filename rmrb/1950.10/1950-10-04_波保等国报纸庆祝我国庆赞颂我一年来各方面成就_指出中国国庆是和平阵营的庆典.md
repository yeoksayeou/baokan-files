Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 3rd. Polish and Bulgarian newspapers published special editions on October 1st to celebrate our National Day. All newspapers prominently featured portraits of Chairman Mao and congratulatory telegrams from the leaders of the two governments on our National Day, and published editorials and many special articles describing the achievements of the People's Republic of China in all fields over the past year.

　　The editorial of the Polish United Workers' Party's organ, People's Tribune, stated: The victory of the Chinese people is the third heavy blow to the imperialist system after the great October Revolution and the Soviet Union's victory in the Second World War. The capitalist world has lost China, which accounts for nearly a quarter of the world's population, while the socialist and democratic world has become stronger as a result. The Polish Republican Newspaper wrote: China, with a population of about 500 million, has joined the family of progressive countries. Therefore, China's National Day celebration is also a celebration for the entire anti-imperialist camp—the peace camp.

　　The editorial of the Bulgarian Communist Party's organ, Workers' Cause, cited many figures to praise the achievements China has made in the past year with the help of the Soviet Union, and believes that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance "is a great contribution to consolidating the cause of world peace and democracy." The Bulgarian Izgrev newspaper wrote: "The victory of the Chinese people is a true example for the people of all ethnic groups in Eastern colonies. China is a great lighthouse illuminating the path of colonial people and oppressed nations."

　　Also, the Israeli Communist Party's organ, People's Voice, also published a special edition to celebrate our National Day. The newspaper contained a portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong, photos of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and articles commenting on China written by Israeli writers and translated from Soviet newspapers.

　　波保等国报纸庆祝我国庆赞颂我一年来各方面成就
    指出中国国庆是和平阵营的庆典
    【新华社布拉格三日电】波兰和保加利亚的报纸于十月一日出版特刊，庆祝我国国庆。各报均以显著地位刊载了毛主席肖像和两国政府领袖祝贺我国国庆的贺电，并发表社论及许多叙述中华人民共和国建国一年来各方面成就的专文。
    波兰统一工人党机关报人民论坛报的社论称：中国人民的胜利，是伟大的十月革命与苏联在第二次世界大战胜利以后对帝国主义体系的第三个沉重的打击。资本主义世界业已失去了几占世界人口四分之一的中国，而社会主义与民主世界却因此而愈趋强大了。波兰共和报写道：中国带着约五亿的人口，参加了进步国家的家庭。因此，中国的国庆大典，也就是整个反帝国主义阵营——和平阵营的庆典。
    保加利亚共产党机关报工人事业报的社论援引了许多数字，赞扬中国立国一年来在苏联帮助下所获得的成就，并认为中苏友好互助条约“是对于巩固全世界和平民主事业的巨大贡献”。保加利亚伊兹格列夫报写道：“中国人民的胜利是东方殖民地各族人民的真正榜样。中国是照耀着殖民地人民与被压迫民族的道路的伟大灯塔。”
    又讯：以色列共产党机关报人民之声报也为庆祝我国国庆出版特刊。该报载有毛泽东主席的肖像、中国人民解放军的照片与以色列作家撰写的及从苏联报纸翻译过来的评论中国的文章。
