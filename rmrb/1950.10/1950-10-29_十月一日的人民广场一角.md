　　A Corner of the People's Square on October 1st
    Hu Feng
    I
    Passing through the ancient trees of the Taimiao (Imperial Ancestral Temple) and exiting through the side gate, you enter People's Square.

    Suddenly, you feel the bright sunshine filling the sky. High and vast. It seems that only the sunshine here in all of Beijing is so bright, so broad, and so high. The people coming in to watch the ceremony and the staff on the square are moving about happily, laughing, talking, and greeting each other. But the entire venue is permeated with an atmosphere of solemnity.

    This kind of atmosphere, both joyful and solemn, is only slightly similar to one occasion in the past life of old China: the eve of the Lunar New Year, after the firecrackers have been set off, the candlelight flickers, a year of hard work is over, the troubles of the year are over, now all that remains are loved ones, and the joyful days are about to begin; at that time, the children watch the adults busy with reverence, unable to see their faces of hardship, nor worried about being beaten or scolded, feeling a sense of calm solemnity, but their hearts are filled with the joy of anticipation.

    On the other side of the square, directly facing the reviewing stand and the grandstand, the vanguard of the sea, land, and air forces, who will be reviewed first, stand in square formations, neatly and immovably, like the foundation stones of a huge building that is about to be built. Beneath the bright sunshine, a solemnity rises, but it is a dignified solemnity.

    We walk past the front of the left grandstand, past the stone bridge in front of the reviewing stand, and then past the front of the right grandstand, entering from the far right entrance of the right grandstand. The left and right grandstands are already full of people. As we walk, we frequently run to the half-height wall, shaking hands and greeting acquaintances, laughing and shouting happily. However, we still feel that the entire venue is permeated with an atmosphere of solemnity; like innocent children, laughing and jumping, but always faintly feeling that the calm gaze of their mother, standing or following behind, is embracing and enveloping them.

    Walking past the front of the right grandstand, past the combat heroes and labor models, we suddenly see a row of men and women dressed in colorful clothes; like a row of flowers of different colors, blooming towards our eyes all at once. These are compatriots from various ethnic minorities. We later learned that they were members of cultural work troupes brought by ethnic minority representatives to participate in the ceremony, and later they will also participate in the mass parade to perform and be reviewed. My brothers and sisters from remote areas, I see you, I see that you have come here. How fortunate that I can stand together with you!

    II

    We found our seats next to them.

    I greedily look at them, these young faces wearing strange silver ornaments and dressed in various styles of colorful clothing, without the slightest hint of unfamiliarity, as if they have not come to an unfamiliar place, as if they were born and raised here.

    I greedily look at them, feeling that they are not from remote places, feeling that they were born among us, grew up among us, those strange silver ornaments and various styles of colorful clothing are things we have seen many, many times in previous festivals.

    I greedily look at those young faces, gradually feeling that within that air of no unfamiliarity, something new is appearing. What is it? Or, let's tentatively call it simplicity. It is something that people who have gone through complex social lives and heavy ideological burdens do not have. No, it is a precious thing that has been corroded by complex social lives and heavy ideological burdens.

    Combat heroes and labor models constantly pass by them, also greedily looking at them. Some stop and smile at them. Gradually, more and more people stop. Finally, some take out notebooks and ask them for autographs, and others follow suit. More and more people are stopping and taking out notebooks. They sit on the cement steps, some signing in Chinese characters, but most signing in their own ethnic languages. Those watching them and asking for their signatures stand or squat among them, beside them, in front of them, bending over.

    I also squeezed in, squatting among them, but I didn't bring a notebook. I wanted to hear their voices, I wanted to see their faces more closely. I couldn't help but ask the Korean comrades from the Northeast in Japanese if they understood. They glanced at me, and a beautiful young woman gently nodded. I said awkwardly, knowing that the drum beside them is called a "long drum," and that their work is dancing, singing, and music. I spoke very unnaturally, as if it was the first time I had spoken Japanese. I couldn't ask any more questions. I had heard that the Korean people detest Japanese, and it would evoke their painful and hateful emotions. In such a hurried conversation, it is impossible to remove this emotional hue from this language, which is inherently innocent. I turned to two Inner Mongolian comrades. They understood a little Chinese. I told them that I knew a Comrade Ulan. I tried to pronounce "Ulan" in Mongolian, but they actually understood. The two of them almost simultaneously looked at each other, and almost simultaneously nodded heavily; as if, through the pronunciation of "Ulan," another blood vessel of emotion had suddenly been added between me and them.

    It was too crowded, so I stood up and returned to my seat. The bright sunshine was warmly shining. I looked at them, and at the combat heroes and labor models standing or squatting among them, beside them, in front of them. I felt a wave of affection floating under the warm sunshine.

    A young boy, obviously from the Southwest, wearing a bamboo-woven conical hat and a new blue cloth jacket and trousers, with straw sandals on his feet, nimbly weaved through the crowd to the front. I felt that this was the most beautiful outfit in his life, I felt that it was a very good and wonderful thing that he came here wearing this outfit in its original form.

    A young woman, also wearing silver ornaments and colorful clothes, had sparse, grayish-black spots on her bare brown calves below the knees. I seemed to suddenly wake up, remembering stories of old China: under the feudal rule of Han chauvinism, ethnic minority compatriots were displaced to barren mountains, where life forced them to walk up and down among thorns and rocks, life made them practice walking in these places faster and more nimbly than we walk on flat ground. However, their feet are also made of flesh and blood, and they used their flesh and blood feet to develop a "skill" of walking faster on thorn tips and sharp rock edges than walking on flat ground. Just thinking about it now seems to bring a pang of pain. I heard that the soles of their feet are very thick...

    I remembered the ethnic minority dances I saw in Guilin. So healthy, so fresh, it amazed us, but I always felt that their emotions were veiled, unable to be released, and we couldn't feel the inner passion that gave rise to this dance form. Later I heard that: during harvest festivals, they hold large dance gatherings on mountain plains, where young men and women dance and sing enthusiastically, sometimes with more than 100,000 people; but the reactionary Kuomintang rulers, fearing their emotional life, especially emotional life in large gatherings, used cruel methods to ban it!

    Later, when passing through Guizhou, the car stopped in a small town, and I saw two ethnic minority women carrying coal down the mountain. There was a frame under the basket, which they used to prop it up when resting, so that they wouldn't have to put it on the ground and then carry it back on their shoulders when resting; they had a bamboo ring hanging under their necks, black and shiny, which they picked up to scrape away sweat, scraping it along their foreheads and flicking it to the side; they couldn't even afford to use cloth pieces like towels. This image has stayed in my mind ever since, and whenever I hear about ethnic minority affairs, this image appears before my eyes...

    Now, all of this is over. They have come here, to Beijing, the capital of our shared People's Republic of China. There is no trace of unfamiliarity on their faces; under the bright, warm sunshine, combat heroes and labor models stand or squat among them, beside them, in front of them, united by the happy feelings of a great festival shared by all the people of the country.

    The time is approaching. A row of figures appeared on the Tiananmen reviewing stand.

    Someone noticed and looked up, gazing towards there; then, more and more people looked up, gazing towards there. Someone raised their hand and waved towards there; then, more and more people raised their hands and waved towards there. Comrades in colorful clothing also raised their heads and craned their necks to look there, raising their hands and waving towards there. We have not yet developed the habit of cheering, but the same voice is resounding in our hearts: Is he here? Which one is him, can you see clearly? Is he here, is he here?...

    III

    The celebration began. The salutes sounded.

    It is the sound that brought the entire People's Square to the greatest solemnity and the highest cheers, the sound that filled the entire People's Square with the most magnificent grandeur and the most tender tenderness, the sound that shook the entire People's Square but made the heart of every person in the People's Square beat sweetly together.

    Ethnic minority comrades stood with us, listening to this sound like us; there was nothing different on their faces, showing the same emotions as us, as if this was exactly what they had expected and were familiar with.

    The parade began. To the sound of majestic military music, under the bright sunshine, the fluttering bright red flags moved forward; the white naval forces marched forward, the ochre yellow air force and army forces marched forward; like a neat forest, holding guns, carrying guns, embracing guns, the upright bayonets sparkled in the sunshine as they moved forward; like thunder rolling on the ground, the artillery troops moved forward; like waves of steel sheets converging, the tank troops moved forward; like a huge downpour, the cavalry troops moved forward; like a sky-filled wind, aircraft formations moved forward in the air…

    The power of the people caresses us, the power of the motherland caresses us, the power of Mao Zedong's Party caresses us; as if each of us is a drop of this vast ocean, and as if each of these drops is connected to and merged with this vast ocean.

    Ethnic minority comrades stood with us, looking at the river-like processions like us, receiving the caress of this immense power like us; there was nothing different on their faces, showing the same emotions as us, as if this was exactly what they had expected and were familiar with.

    After the armed forces parade, there was a grand procession of over 300,000 people from the capital, like a leaping, laughing river following the neat flowing river.

    At the very front marched 15,000 young boys and girls, Young Pioneers wearing red scarves. A row wearing red tops, a row wearing blue tops, and most of all, rows and rows wearing white tops; these pure young lives, row after row holding flags, row after row holding peace doves, and most of all, rows and rows holding colorful bouquets. A crisp chorus of "Long live!" came from in front of the reviewing stand, and a loud "Long live!" came from the reviewing stand, and the entire People's Square blossomed with joyful youthful vitality.

    These pure lives, like shining waves, holding flags, holding peace doves, holding colorful bouquets, flowed towards us. As they flowed, they saw the combat heroes, labor models, and ethnic minority comrades, and their enthusiasm rose to a peak, cheering and vigorously waving the flags, doves, and bouquets. Row after row passed, and the enthusiasm that followed rose even higher, throwing the bouquets in their hands towards the ethnic minority comrades. The bouquets were too light to reach, and those who followed completely forgot the parade discipline, and groups of them left the ranks, rushing to the front of the grandstand, scrambling to deliver the bouquets to the hands of the ethnic minority comrades, grabbing their hands and shaking them desperately, their pure and young faces flashing with happy smiles. A young girl, while grabbing hands and shaking them, shouted: I wish you good health! Following her, many clear voices shouted: I wish you good health! I wish you good health!... A young girl, her face flushed, ran back to rejoin the ranks, while turning her head back and shouting: Goodbye! Goodbye! As if she thought these comrades in colorful clothing lived very close to her, and she would have the opportunity to meet again at any time on her way to study and work.

    I watched over this happy spectacle, feeling a heat surge to my throat and eyes: How difficult, thousands of years of painful class oppression and ethnic killings, on this day of the great festival of the entire Chinese people, on this People's Square in the capital of the motherland, has been declared to be over by our pure young boys and girls, who represent the young generation of the New China, with their sincere enthusiasm!...

　　十月一日的人民广场一角
    胡风
    一
    从太庙的古树下面穿过，走出了边门，就进了人民广场。
    突然感到了满天明晃晃的阳光。高朗。广阔。好像全北京只有这里的阳光才那么亮，亮得那么广又那么高。不断走进来的观礼的人们和会场上的工作员们在快活地走动，笑着说话，打招呼。但整个会场却是弥漫着一种肃静的气氛。
    这一种那么快活又那么肃静的浑然的气氛，在过去了的旧中国生活里面，只有一个场合和这有一点点相像：大除夕的黄昏，放过了爆竹，烛光在一闪一闪地亮着，一年的辛劳过去了，年终的困扰过去了，现在所有的都是亲人，都要开始几天快活的日子；那时候的小孩子，望着大人们在虔敬地忙着，看不到他们困苦的脸色，也不耽心有什么打骂了，感到一种安心的肃静，但心里却是满满的跃跃欲动的欢喜。
    广场那一边，正对着检阅台和观礼台，要最先受到检阅的海、陆、空先头部队排成一堵一堵的方阵在站着，整整齐齐的，一动也不动，好像是什么就要建筑起来的巨大的建筑物底一方一方的基石。在明晃晃的阳光下面，升起一片肃静，但却是庄严的肃静。
    我们从左台前面走过，从检阅台前的石桥前面走过，还要走过右台前面，从右台最右端的入口进去。左台和右台里面已经站满了人，我们一面走过去，一面时时跑到半身高的围墙前面去，和那里面的熟人握手，打招呼，快活地笑着叫着。然而，还是觉得整个会场弥漫着一种肃静的气氛；好像是天真的小孩子，在笑着跳着，但总隐隐地觉得，站在后面或跟在后面的那一双平静的母亲的目光，一直在拥抱着自己，笼罩着自己。
    从右台前面走过，从战斗英雄们和劳动模范们前面走过，突然看到了一列穿着彩色衣服的男男女女；好像是一列颜色不同的花，一下子朝着我们的眼睛开放了。这是各少数民族的同胞们，后来晓得是少数民族代表带来的文工团员们，在这里参加观礼，回头还要参加到群众行列里面去表演，接受检阅的。你边远地区的弟妹们，我看到了你们，我看到你们来到了这里。多么巧，我能够和你们站在一起了！
    二
    我们在他们旁边找定了位子。
    我贪恋地看着他们，这些戴着奇异的白银装饰品和穿着各种样式的彩色服装的年青的面孔，没有一点生疏的神气，好像他们并不是来到了一个生疏的地方，好像他们原来就是生在这个地方，长大在这个地方的。
    我贪恋地看着他们，觉得他们并不是来自边远的地方，觉得原来就是生在我们中间，长大在我们中间，那些奇异的白银装饰品和各种样式的彩色服装是我们在以前的节日里面看到过许多次许多次的。
    我贪恋地看着那些年青的面孔，渐渐地觉得，在那没有一点生疏感觉的神气里面，现出了什么新的东西。那是什么呢？或者，暂时把那叫做质朴罢。那是经过了复杂的社会生活和沉重的思想负担的人所没有的东西。不，那是被复杂的社会生活和沉重的思想负担所腐蚀掉了的、宝贵的东西。
    战斗英雄们和劳动模范们不断地从他们身边走过，也贪恋地看着他们。有的站了下来，对着他们微笑。渐渐地，站下来的人更多了。终于，有的掏出了笔记本子要他们签名，别人也跟着掏了出来。站了下来，掏出笔记本子的人越来越多了。他们坐在士敏土台级上面，有的用汉字，但最多的是用自己民族的文字签着名，看着他们的、要他们签名的人就弯着身子站在或者蹲在他们中间、旁边、前面。
    我也挤了进去，蹲在他们中间，但我没有带笔记本子，我想听到他们的声音，我想更近一些看一看他们的脸色。我禁不住用日本话问东北来的朝鲜同胞懂不懂，他们望了我一望，一位美丽的少女轻轻地点了一点头。我不自然地说着，知道了他们身边的鼓叫做“长鼓”，知道了他们的工作是舞蹈、唱歌、音乐。我说得很不自然，好像是第一次说日本话。我不能多问了，曾经听说朝鲜人民是厌恶日本话的，这会引起他们的痛苦和仇恨的情绪。在这样匆促的谈话中间，要使这个本身本来无罪的语言在他们心里失去这种情绪的色调，是不可能的。我转向了两位内蒙的同胞。他们懂得一点汉话。我告诉他们，我认识一位乌兰同志。我学着把“乌兰”用蒙语发音，但他们居然听懂了，两个人几乎是同时地对望一望，也几乎是同时地重重地点了一下头；好像是，通过“乌兰”这个发音，我和他们之间突然又加多了一支感情的血管。
    人太挤了，我站了起来，回到了自己的位子。明晃晃的阳光在温暖地照着。我望着他们，和站在或者蹲在他们中间、旁边、前面的战斗英雄们和劳动模范们。觉得在温暖的阳光下面飘动着一团亲爱的气息。
    有一个少年，看得出是从西南来的，戴着一顶竹制的尖顶圆凉帽，穿着新的青布裤褂，脚下是一双草鞋，敏捷地从人缝中间穿到前面去。我觉得这在他的生活里面是最漂亮的服装，我觉得他穿了这本来面目的服装来到这里是非常好非常好的事情。
    有一个青年女子，也戴着银的装饰品，穿着彩色衣服，她赤露着的膝盖以下的褐色小腿上面，有稀落的灰黑色的小斑。我好像突然清醒了，记起了旧中国的故事：在大汉族主义的封建统治下面，少数民族同胞们流住到了荒瘠的山上，生活使他们非得在荆棘和乱石中间走上走下不可，生活使他们练习得在这些地方走得比我们在平地上走得更快，更敏捷。然而，他们的双脚同样是肉做的，他们就用血肉的双脚在荆棘尖刺和石头棱角中间练出了一种比在平地上走得还快的“本领”，现在想一想都似乎感觉上有了一阵痛楚。听说他们的脚底皮是很厚很厚的……。
    我记起了在桂林看到过的少数民族的舞蹈。那么健康，那么清新，使我们吃惊了，然而，总觉得他们的感情是被蒙住了，不能发散出来，我们不能从这舞蹈形式上感到产生了它的内在的热情。后来听说：在收获过后的节日，他们在山间平地上举行大舞蹈会，青年男女们热情地舞蹈着，唱着，有时多到十多万人；但反动的国民党统治害怕他们的这种感情生活，尤其是大群聚的感情生活，用残酷的手段禁止了！
    后来从贵州过的时候，在一个小城停车，看到有两个少数民族的女同胞，背着煤炭下来，背兜下面有一个架子，休息的时候就由它支着，这就不致休息的时候放到地下再背不上肩去；颈项下面挂着一个蔑圈圈，乌黑乌黑的，拿起它来刮汗水，顺着额头一刮，向旁边洒掉；她们是连手巾之类的布片都用不起的。这一个影子一直在我的脑子里留着，后来每一听到少数民族的事情，这影子就在我的眼前浮现了出来。……
    现在，这些都过去了。他们来到了这里，来到了我们大家共有的中华人民共和国的首都北京。他们的脸上没有一点生疏感觉的神气；在明晃晃的温暖的阳光下面，战斗英雄们和劳动模范们站在或者蹲在他们中间、旁边、前面，被一个全国人民共同享受的大节日的幸福感情结合在一起。
    时间快到了。天安门检阅台上出现了一列人影。
    有人注意到了，抬起头向那里张望着；接着，更多的人抬起头向那里张望着。有人举起手向那里摇着；接着，更多的人举起手向那里摇着。彩色服装的同胞们也抬起头伸着脖子向那里张望着，举起手向那里摇着。我们还没有养成欢呼的习惯，但我们的心里都在响着同样的声音：他来了么？哪一个是他，你看得清么？他来了么，来了么？……
    三
    庆祝仪式开始了。礼炮响了起来。
    是使整个人民广场达到了最大的肃静和最高的欢呼的响声，是使整个人民广场充满了最雄壮的雄壮和最温柔的温柔的响声，是把整个人民广场震动了但却又使人民广场上每一个人的心房都甜蜜地跳动在一起了的响声。
    少数民族的同胞们和我们站在一起，和我们一样听着这个响声；他们的脸色上没有一点异样，现出了和我们同样的感情，好像这正是他们所期待、所熟悉的。
    分列式开始了。在雄浑的军乐声里面，在明晃晃的阳光下面，飘流着的鲜红的大旗行进；白色的海军部队行进，赭黄色的空军陆军部队行进；一字整齐的森林一样，端着枪行进，背着枪行进，抱着枪行进，直竖着的刺刀在阳光里闪耀着行进；像在地面滚动的雷声，炮车部队行进；像钢片汇成的浪涛声，坦克部队行进；像巨大的骤雨声，骑兵部队行进；像漫天的大风声，飞机列队在空中行进……。
    人民的力量摇抚着我们，祖国的力量摇抚着我们，毛泽东党的力量摇抚着我们；好像我们每一个人是这万顷波涛的一点一滴，也好像我们这每一点一滴都是和这万顷的波涛连结在一起、溶合在一起的。
    少数民族的同胞们和我们站在一起，和我们一样望着这大河河流似的行列，和我们一样接受着这巨大的力量的摇抚；他们的脸色上没有一点异样，现出了和我们同样的感情，好像这正是他们所期待、所熟悉的。
    武装部队分列式以后，是三十多万首都人民的大行列，像是整齐地奔流着的大河河流后面跟来了跳跃着欢笑着的大河河流。
    行进在最前面的是一万五千个少男少女，打着红领巾的少年儿童队员们。穿着红上衣的一列，穿着蓝上衣的一列，最多的是穿着白上衣的一列一列；这些纯真的年青的生命，一列列地拿着旗子，一列列地拿着和平鸽子，最多的是一列一列地拿着彩色的花束。从检阅台前面传来了清脆的一片“万岁！”的呼声，从检阅台上传来了洪大的“万岁！”的呼声，整个人民广场绽放开了欢乐的青春的活力。
    这些纯真的生命，像放光的波浪，举着旗子，举着和平鸽子，举着彩色的花束，向着我们流来了。流来了，他们看到了战斗英雄、劳动模范、和少数民族同胞们，他们的热情又升到了一个顶点，欢呼了起来，把旗子、鸽子、花束起劲地摇了起来。一列列地过去了，跟着来的热情更高升了，把手上的花束向少数民族同胞抛了过来。花束太轻，抛不到，跟着来的就完全忘记了会场的行进纪律，一群一群地离开了行列，冲到了观礼台前面，抢着把花束送到少数民族同胞们的手上，抓着他们的手拚命地摇着，纯真而年青的脸上闪耀着幸福的笑色。一个少女一面抓起手来摇着一面叫了起来：祝你们健康！跟着有许多清脆的声音叫了起来：祝你们健康！祝你们健康！……一个少女一面涨红着脸跑去归队，一面回过头来叫着：再会！再会！好像她以为这些彩色服装的同胞们和她住得很近，在她学习和工作的路上随时都有机会再会。
    我守望着这个幸福的奇景，感到有一股热力冲到了我的喉头和眼里：好艰难，几千年痛苦的阶级压迫和民族残杀，在全中国人民大节日的今天，在祖国首都的这个人民广场上面，由我们纯真的少男少女们用他们至诚的热情表现代表了新中国年青的一代，宣告结束了！……
