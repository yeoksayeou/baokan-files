Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd dispatch from Prague: TASS reports: The meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Albania held its final session in Prague on the evening of the 21st, chaired by Bulgarian Foreign Minister Neichev. The meeting has adopted a statement on the decisions made at the New York meeting of the United States, Britain, and France regarding the remilitarization of West Germany. This statement will be published separately by each country.

Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd dispatch from Prague: TASS reports: The meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Albania held its second session here at the Czechoslovakian Republic's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the morning of the 21st. The meeting, chaired by Albanian representative Nataneli, continued to discuss the issue of West German remilitarization. All representatives participated in the discussion, after which a committee was formed to organize the various proposals that had been made. The next meeting will be held on the evening of the 21st.

Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd dispatch from Moscow: The Moscow newspapers of the 22nd published the statement of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Albania regarding the decision of the New York meeting of the United States, Britain, and France to remilitarize West Germany. The full text of the statement is as follows:

On September 19th of this year, the United States, Britain, and France held a secret meeting in New York and issued a communique pointing out that several separate new decisions regarding the German issue were adopted at the meeting. The communique pointed out that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France intended to raise the issue of ending the state of war with Germany. At the same time, the communique affirmed the intention to maintain the "occupation statute" forcibly imposed on West Germany. The communique went on to say that previous decisions regarding the prohibition and restriction of German industry would be re-examined, without making any reservations regarding the prohibition of the restoration of German war industries. At the same time, it is clear from the communique that the main issue at the meeting of the three foreign ministers was the reconstruction of the German army, the remilitarization of West Germany.

From these key points of the above communique, it is already clear that the separate decisions made by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France in New York regarding the German issue once again grossly violated the obligations undertaken by the three governments in the Potsdam Agreement. These decisions contain a threat to European peace and violate the interests of all peace-loving people, including the national interests of the German people.

The Policy of the Three Countries to Rebuild West German War Industries Is to Shift the German Economy Towards Preparing for a New War

(1) The statement by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France that they intend to raise the issue of "ending the state of war with Germany" is completely hypocritical. It has nothing to do with the necessity of completing the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, which has long become an urgent matter, and without which it is impossible to restore the unity of the German nation.

When discussing the end of the state of war with Germany, the communique emphasized that this "will not affect the rights and status of the three countries in Germany," and that the three countries will retain unlimited power in West Germany according to the occupation statute. In this way, the three governments once again affirmed that the "occupation statute" is inviolable, and they want to extend the validity of this statute indefinitely in order to maintain their rule in West Germany for as long as possible.

Not only that, but the communique also stated that the three occupying powers "will increase and strengthen their troops in Germany." According to published reports, the occupation costs in West Germany will therefore almost double, which will greatly increase the tax burden. There is no need to prove that the decision of the three governments to increase the occupation forces in West Germany again is only due to the increasing aggressive desires of these countries in Europe.

It is now clear that the so-called "ending" the state of war with Germany is nothing more than a smokescreen to cover up the policies of the leaders of the aggressive North Atlantic Alliance. These countries want to freely use West Germany, its manpower and resources, to realize their strategic plans for their imperialist interests, which in essence is the desire of the American ruling clique to contend for world hegemony. Under the pretext of ending the state of war with Germany, they are striving to create conditions to include West Germany in the aggressive group of the so-called North Atlantic Alliance and completely turn West Germany into a tool of their aggressive military strategy in Europe.

It is equally clear that the reason for raising the issue of ending the state of war with Germany is to delay the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany as much as possible, thereby delaying the reunification of Germany. The lengthy New York communique mentioned neither a peace treaty with Germany nor preparations for such a treaty. However, as early as five years ago, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France undertook the obligation to prepare a peace treaty with Germany due to the Potsdam decision, but now they are using all kinds of excuses to evade the fulfillment of this obligation. This shows how far the governments of the United States, Britain, and France have deviated from the Potsdam Four-Power Agreement. This also shows that the policy of the United States, Britain, and France in greatly violating the Potsdam Agreement is directly contrary to the interests of all peace-loving people in Europe.

The United States, Britain, and France Are Trying to Delay the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty with Germany as Much as Possible, Attempting to Maintain Their Rule in West Germany for a Long Time

(2) The communique states that "agreements on the prohibition and restriction of industry will be re-examined from the perspective of developing relations with the Federal Republic," which refers to West Germany. At the same time, no mention is made of the prohibition of the restoration of war industries, while the prohibition of the restoration of war industries was stipulated by the Yalta Agreement and the Potsdam Agreement, as well as the subsequent Four-Power Agreement of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. In addition, the communique also stated that for the purpose of war, steel production is allowed to be free from the established restrictions.

In this way, in the communique of the three foreign ministers, the ban on German war industries, which was unanimously adopted by the four countries in a firm decision, is actually cancelled. The true meaning of the New York communique is that the heavy industry in the Ruhr is now being openly adjusted to meet the military strategic tasks of the Western countries. The New York communique of the three countries opened the door wide to the restoration of the war industrial potential of West Germany, which was once the main stronghold of German imperialism and Hitler's aggression. All this shows how rudely and unreasonably the governments of the United States, Britain, and France are now trampling on the joint decisions of the four countries passed with the participation of the Soviet Union. These decisions aimed to prohibit German war industries and prevent the revival of German militarism, and the peace-loving people of Europe and the world expressed unlimited satisfaction with these decisions.

The attempt to establish a super-monopoly company of West German and French coal and metallurgical industries with the participation of several other European countries is also aimed at rebuilding the war industrial potential of West Germany and coordinating the economy of West Germany with the plans of the Anglo-American military bloc. This plan, carried out by the monopoly capital of West Germany and France under the instructions of the American government, relying on the most reactionary groups in West Germany, contains a serious danger of reviving German aggressive forces, and it is naturally resolutely resisted by democrats in France, West Germany, and other European countries.

This policy of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France is clearly contrary to the basic principles of the Potsdam Agreement, which aims to restore Germany as a peace-loving democratic country on the basis of revitalizing and further developing Germany's peaceful industry, agriculture, and other economic sectors. The purpose of the policies of the United States, Britain, and France is to shift the development of the German economy to the road of preparing for a new war in Europe, rather than giving the German people all the necessary opportunities to develop a peaceful economy, heal the wounds of war, rebuild their cities, and improve the material conditions of the working people's lives; and this is what the Soviet Union has consistently and resolutely advocated.

The United States, Britain, and France Are Trying to Rebuild the West German Regular Army and Have Completely Abandoned the Former Decisions of the Four Countries

(3) As mentioned above, the main issue discussed at the New York meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the United States, Britain, and France was the reconstruction of the German army, although the communique used all means to cover up this issue. According to the communique, the three foreign ministers agreed that in addition to the existing police force in West Germany, "mobile police units will be allowed to be established"; in addition, it is stipulated that "Germany will participate in a unified force," which in fact stipulates the establishment of a German army, although the communique also hypocritically states that "rebuilding the German national army would not be the most beneficial for Germany and Europe."

According to the materials that have been published, the German and foreign military forces (including "wartime refugees") in West Germany and West Berlin, as well as various police forces, total 456,000 people, most of whom are former officers and soldiers of the Hitler army.

The equipment of these police and military forces, their organizational structure and military training, the establishment of special schools to train officers for them, and their participation in military exercises with the occupying forces of Western countries, all prove that these military forces and police forces are real armies. These forces possess tanks and artillery units. Despite this, the communique of the three foreign ministers also mentioned allowing the establishment of new "mobile police units," insisting that this is in line with "the requirements of the current situation." It can be seen that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France are clearly trying to greatly expand the West German police force, which is in fact the German regular army.

However, the communique shows that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France are currently not satisfied with the police force, and have gone further to openly raise the issue of "Germany participating in unified forces." Although the communique states that this issue is currently "a subject under study," this way of expressing it is clearly intended to prepare public opinion and pave the way for the decision of the three governments to rebuild the German army. It is no longer a secret that Hitler's generals such as Halder, Guderian, and Manteuffel have been recruited to participate in the reconstruction of the German army. It can be clearly seen in the communique that the purpose of this behavior is to make the army of West Germany, which is being revived, serve the Anglo-American bloc and its war plans.

In this case, it is naturally not surprising that the governments of the three Western countries want to lift the previous restrictions on German war industries. This is exactly what the monopoly capital of West Germany has always stubbornly pursued. It was only yesterday that the people of France, Britain, and the United States fought bloody battles against the Hitler bandit gang's aggression and German imperialism, but today the ruling groups of these countries are personally restoring the army of West Germany, releasing convicted war criminals, restoring the war industrial potential of West Germany, and reviving German imperialism.

This means that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France have completely abandoned the previous decisions of the four countries, which expressed the goal of eliminating German imperialism, restoring Germany to a peace-loving democratic country, and strengthening the great principles of world peace.

This means that the governments of the three Western countries have further adopted an aggressive policy, which is incompatible with the interests of European peace and the interests of peace-loving people all over the world.

As everyone knows, in 1948, the Western countries held a separate three-nation conference on the German issue in London. The decisions passed at that time completely abandoned the work of demilitarizing and democratizing Germany, and were determined to turn West Germany into a tool of the Anglo-American aggressive bloc. At that time, the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, Romania, and Hungary held a meeting in Warsaw and issued a statement on the three-nation London conference on the German issue, exposing the aggressive and anti-democratic nature of the separatist policies of the United States, Britain, and France towards Germany.

The Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Hungary, and the German Democratic Republic now consider it their responsibility to declare that the recommendations made in the Warsaw statement and the general assessment of the three countries' policies towards Germany have been fully confirmed as correct. Now everyone sees that the current policies of the United States, Britain, and France not only completely violate the obligations undertaken by the governments of these countries regarding the establishment of a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, but also pose a threat of new aggression and new military adventures in Europe.

It Is Necessary to Prevent the Revival of Germany's War Potential, Conclude a Peace Treaty as Soon as Possible, and Promote the Reunification of All Germany

In view of the above, the governments of the Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Hungary, and the German Democratic Republic declare that the separate decisions of the New York three-nation conference have no legal effect or international authority. The governments of the United States, Britain, and France shall be fully responsible for all illegal actions that attempt to obstruct the peace treaty with Germany and attempt to remilitarize West Germany.

For the sake of maintaining European peace and security, and considering the legitimate desire of the German people to complete the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible, the governments of the Soviet Union, Albania, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Hungary, and the German Democratic Republic believe that the following tasks are truly urgent:

1. The governments of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should issue a statement declaring that they will not allow Germany to be remilitarized, nor will they allow Germany to be dragged into any kind of aggressive plan; they will firmly and unswervingly implement the Potsdam Agreement on guaranteeing the conditions for the establishment of a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany.

2. Abolish all restrictions on the peaceful economic development of Germany and prevent the restoration of Germany's war potential.

3. Conclude a peace treaty with Germany without delay, restore the unification of Germany in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, and stipulate that the occupation forces of all countries shall withdraw from Germany within one year after the conclusion of the peace treaty.

4. Establish an all-German constitutional assembly composed of representatives from East Germany and West Germany on an equal basis. The assembly will prepare to establish a democratic, peace-loving, and sovereign all-German provisional government, and submit corresponding proposals to the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France for joint approval; and before the establishment of the all-German government, consult with the assembly on the issue of drafting a peace treaty. In some cases, such proposals may be submitted directly to the German people for a vote of referendum.

The governments of the Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Hungary, and the German Democratic Republic will promote the solution of these urgent tasks as much as possible in order to strengthen peace and international security.

　　苏德等八国外长会议发表声明
    指出美英法对德国的决定没有法律效力应即缔结对德和约并成立全德立宪议会
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社布拉格讯：苏联、德意志民主共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚及阿尔巴尼亚八国外长会议，于二十一日晚在布拉格举行最后一次会议，由保加利亚外交部长奈捷夫主持。会议已就美英法三国纽约会议关于西德重新军事化的决定通过了声明一件。这一声明将由各国分别发表。
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社布拉格讯：苏联、德意志民主共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚及阿尔巴尼亚等八国外长会议，于二十一日晨在此间的捷克斯洛伐克共和国外交部举行第二次会议。会议由阿尔巴尼亚代表纳塔奈利主持，继续讨论西德重新军事化的问题。全体代表均参加了讨论，随后即组成一委员会整理各项已经提出的建议。下次会议将于二十一日晚举行。
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：二十二日的莫斯科各报刊载了苏联、德意志民主共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚及阿尔巴尼亚八国外长关于美英法三国纽约会议将德国西部重新军事化的决定的声明，声明全文如下：
    今年九月十九日，美英法三国在纽约举行的秘密会议发表了会议公报，指出会上通过了若干关于德国问题的单独的新决定。该公报指出：美英法三国政府意欲提出结束对德战争状态的问题。同时公报肯定要保持强行施行于德国西部的“占领法规”。该公报继谓，以前关于禁止与限制德国工业的决定将重新加以审查，而对于德国战争工业不容许恢复的问题未作任何保留。同时，从该公报中显然可以看出：三外长会议上的主要问题是重建德国军队，德国西部重新军事化的问题。
    从上述公报的这些要点中，已经可以明显地看出：美英法三国政府在纽约所作的关于德国问题的单独的决定，又一次粗暴地违犯了该三国政府在波茨坦协定中所承担的义务，这些决定含有对欧洲和平的威胁，违反一切爱好和平的人民的利益，包括德国人民的民族利益在内。
    三国重建西德战争工业的政策是要转移德国经济准备新战争
    （一）美英法三国政府关于它们有意提出“结束对德战争状态”问题的声明是彻头彻尾地伪善的，它与早就成为当务之急的完成缔结对德和约的必要性毫无相同之处，而没有这个和约就不可能恢复德意志国家的统一。
    该公报在谈到结束对德战争状态的时候强调指出：这“并不会影响三国在德国的权利与地位”，该三个国家按照占领法规的在德国西部保有无限的权力。这样，三国政府就再次肯定了“占领法规”是不可违反的，它们想要无限期地延长这个法规的效力，以便尽可能长久地维持它们在德国西部的统治。
    不仅如此，该公报还说：三占领国“将增加与加强它们在德国的军队”。从已发表的报道可以知道，德国西部占领费因此将几乎增大一倍，这将大大加重赋税负担。无需证明，三国政府关于再度增加德国西部占领军的决定只不过是由于这些国家在欧洲的侵略愿望日益增加而已。
    现在已经明白，所谓“结束”对德战争状态的花言巧语，只不过是一个烟幕，想要掩盖侵略性北大西洋联盟的几个领导国家的政策而已。这些国家想要放手利用德国西部，利用它的人力与物资，为了它们的帝国主义的利益而实现它们的战略计划，实质则是美国统治集团争夺世界霸权的欲望。在停止对德战争状态的借口下，它们力求制造条件，以便将德国西部列入所谓北大西洋联盟的侵略集团中，并把德国西部完全变成它们在欧洲的侵略性军事战略计划的工具。
    同样明显的就是：结束对德战争状态的问题所之以提出，是为了要尽可能拖延对德和约的缔订，从而也就延缓德国的统一。冗长的纽约公报既未谈到对德和约，也未谈到这种条约的准备事宜。可是，早在五年前，美英法三国政府就曾因波茨坦决定而担负了准备对德和约的义务，可是现在它们却用尽一切借口来规避义务的履行。这说明了美英法三国的政府已与波茨坦四强协定相距多远。这也说明了美英法三国大大违反波茨坦协定的政策是与欧洲一切爱好和平人民的利益直接相反的。
    美英法尽量拖延缔订对德和约  企图长久维持其在西德的统治
    （二）该公报说：“关于禁止与限制工业的协定将从发展对联邦共和国的关系着眼来重新加以审查”，所谓联邦共和国就是指的德国西部。同时对于禁止战争工业的恢复却只字不提，而禁止战争工业的恢复却是雅尔塔协定与波茨坦协定以及后来美英法苏四国协定所规定了的。此外，公报还说：为了战争的目的，容许钢产不受既定限制的约束。
    这样一来，在三国外长的公报中，四国曾一致通过坚决决定的关于禁止德国战争工业的禁令就实际上被取消了。纽约公报的真正意义是：现在鲁尔的重工业正被公开地加以调整，以便符合西方国家的军事战略任务。三国的纽约公报，给恢复德国西部的战争工业潜力洞开大门，而德国西部是曾经成为德国帝国主义与希特勒侵略的主要堡垒的。所有这一切说明了：现在的美英法三国政府如何粗暴无礼地蹂躏有苏联参加通过的四国联合决定。这些决定的目的在于禁止德国的战争工业，防止德国军国主义的复活，欧洲和全世界爱好和平的人民对这些决定都表示无限的满意的。
    建立有其他若干欧洲国家参加的西德和法国煤和冶金工业超级垄断公司的企图，同样是为了重建德国西部的战争工业潜力，使德国西部的经济与英美军事集团的计划相配合。德国西部和法国的垄断资本仰承美国政府的意旨，依靠德国西部最反动的集团而进行的这种打算，蕴藏着复活德国侵略力量的严重危险，它自然受到法国、德国西部和其他欧洲国家民主人士的坚决反抗。
    美英法三国政府的这种政策显然是与波茨坦协定的基本原则相抵触的，波茨坦协定的目的是在复兴与进一步发展德国的和平工业、农业和其他经济部门的基础上，恢复德国为一个爱好和平的民主国家。美英法三国政策的目的是把德国经济的发展转移到在欧洲准备新战争的道路，而不是给德国人民一切必要的机会来发展和平经济、医治战争创伤、重建他们的城镇和改善劳动人民生活的物质条件；而这一切却是苏联所始终不渝地坚决主张的。
    美英法力图重建西德正规军队已彻底抛弃了四国从前的决定
    （三）上面已经说过，美英法三国外长纽约会议所讨论的主要问题是重建德国军队的问题，虽然公报上用尽了一切办法来掩盖这个问题。据该公报说，三国外长一致同意除了西德现有的警察队之外，“允许设立机动警察部队”；此外，并规定“德国参加一支统一的部队”，事实上这就是规定建立德国军队，虽然公报中也虚伪地声明“重建德国国家军队对德国和欧洲都不会是最有利的”。
    根据已经发表的材料，德国西部和柏林西区的德国和外国军事部队（其中包括“战时流民”），以及各种警察队共有四十五万六千人，大多数都是前希特勒军队的官兵。
    这些警察队与军事部队装备，它们的组织编制和军队训练，设立专门学校为它们训练军官，它们与西方国家占领军共同参加军事演习，这一切证明了这些军事部队与警察队都是真正的军队。这些部队拥有坦克和炮队。尽管这样，三外长公报还说到要允许建立新的“机动警察部队”，硬说这是符合“目前形势的要求”。由此可见，美英法三国政府显然正力图大大扩充实际上就是德国正规军的德国西部的警察部队。
    然而公报表明，美英法三国政府目前已不以警察部队为满足，而且更进而公开提出了“德国参加统一部队”的问题。虽然该公报说这个问题目前还是“研究中的题目”，但这种表示的方式，目的显然是要准备舆论，为三国政府所通过的重建德国军队的决定开辟一条道路。希特勒的将领们如哈尔德、古德林、曼陀菲尔等人已被征来参与重建德国军队的工作，这已经不再是秘密的了。该公报中可以很明显地看到，这种行为的目的是使正在复活中的德国西部的军队为英美集团及其战争计划服务。
    在这种情况下，三个西方国家的政府要取消从前对德国战争工业的限制，自然就毫不足怪了。这正是德国西部的垄断资本所一向执拗地追求的。法英美三国人民对希特勒匪帮侵略，对德国帝国主义进行血腥的搏斗，还只是昨天的事情，然而今日这些国家的统治集团却亲手在恢复德国西部的军队，释放已被判罪的战争罪犯，恢复德国西部的战争工业潜力，复活德国西部的帝国主义。
    这意味着，美英法三国政府已彻底地抛弃了四国从前的决定，那些决定表示了要以消灭德国帝国主义为目的，以把德国恢复为爱好和平的民主国家为目的，并表示了加强全世界和平的伟大原则。
    这意味着，西方三国政府已进而采取了侵略政策，这和欧洲和平的利益、全世界爱好和平人民的利益是不相容的。
    众所周知，一九四八年西方国家即就德国问题在伦敦举行了单独的三国会议，当时通过的决定就已彻头彻尾地抛开了德国非军事化和民主化的工作，而立意要把德国西部变成英美侵略集团的工具。当时，苏联、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫、波兰、罗马尼亚和匈牙利等国外长曾在华沙举行会议，就三国关于德国问题的伦敦会议发表声明，揭露了美英法三国对德分裂政策的侵略和反民主性质。
    苏联、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利和德意志民主共和国现在认为有责任声明，在华沙声明中所提出的建议和关于三国对德政策的一般估计，已经完全证实是正确的。现在谁都看到，美英法三国的现行政策不仅完全违反这些国家的政府关于成立统一、民主、爱好和平的德国所负担的义务，而且造成欧洲新侵略和新军事冒险的威胁。
    必须防止德国战争潜力的复活  从速签订和约促成全德的统一
    鉴于以上所述，苏联、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利和德意志民主共和国的政府声明，纽约三国会议的单独的决定没有法律效力或国际权威。所有企图阻挠对德和约与企图使德国西部重新军事化的非法行动，应由美国、英国及法国政府负完全责任。
    为了维持欧洲和平与安全的利益起见，并考虑到德国人民要求尽可能迅速完成与德国缔结和约的合法愿望，苏联、阿尔巴尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、波兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利和德意志民主共和国政府认为下列各项诚为当务之急：
    一、美英法苏四国政府发表声明，宣布它们将不允许德国重新军事化，亦不容许德国被拉入任何种类的侵略计划之中；它们将坚决不渝地实施关于保证成立统一、爱好和平以及民主的德国的条件的波茨坦协定。
    二、取消对德国和平经济发展的一切限制，并防止德国战争潜力的恢复。
    三、毫不迟延地缔结对德和约，遵照波茨坦协定恢复德国的统一，并规定所有各国占领军在和约缔结后一年内自德国撤退。
    四、在平等的基础上成立由德国东部和德国西部代表组成的全德立宪议会，该议会将筹备成立民主、爱好和平的全德临时主权政府，并将相应的建议提交苏、美、英、法四国政府共同批准；并在全德政府尚未成立以前，与该议会协商拟订和约的问题。在某些情况下，可将这种建议直接交由德国人民投票复决。
    苏联、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利和德意志民主共和国八国政府，为了加强和平与国际安全，将尽可能促进这些迫切任务的解决。
