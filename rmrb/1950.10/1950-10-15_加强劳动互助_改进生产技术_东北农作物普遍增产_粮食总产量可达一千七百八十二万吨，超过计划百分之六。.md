Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 12th. Northeast Chinese farmers are now stepping up the autumn harvest, and the Northeast region's huge agricultural production plan for this year is about to be fully realized.

　　The total sown area in Northeast China this year has expanded to over 162.2 million mu, an increase of more than 6 million mu over last year, approaching the highest sown area before "August 15th" (end of WWII). The sown area of ​​commercial grain and industrial raw material crops, which are of great significance to economic construction, has increased significantly. For example, the sown area of ​​soybeans increased by 22 percent compared to last year; the sown area of ​​wheat also increased by 22 percent; the area of ​​paddy rice increased to more than 3 million mu, reaching the highest level during the puppet Manchukuo period; and the area of ​​cotton has exceeded the highest level during the puppet Manchukuo period, reaching 2.58 million mu. The sown areas of other hemp and sugar beet crops are also more than in previous years.

　　This year's autumn harvest in Northeast China has averaged around 85 percent, and the average yield per mu is about 240 jin (raw grain), an increase of 5.8 percent over the original planned yield and 6 percent over the highest yield during the puppet Manchukuo period. This year's total output of rice in Northeast China exceeded the highest output of the puppet Manchukuo period by 29 percent, wheat by 40 percent, and cotton exceeded this year's planned output, reaching 154,800 tons. It is estimated that the total grain output of the six northeastern provinces this year can reach 17.82 million tons, exceeding the plan by 6 percent.

　　An important condition for the rapid improvement of agricultural production in Northeast China is that the people's government has actively strengthened labor mutual aid organizations and improved agricultural production technology in a planned manner. Since Comrade Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, put forward the slogan "Organize, produce more grain, better than going it alone" last winter, various places have further clarified the purpose of organizing labor exchange and mutual assistance, and conscientiously corrected various compulsory orders and deviations. Starting this spring, a heated competition movement between mutual aid groups and individual households was launched in various places. District and village cadres, Communist Party members, and labor models in various places have actively taken the lead in leading production. At the same time, the people's government has also provided various material assistance to the vast number of peasants, especially mutual aid groups, so that mutual aid organizations have been greatly developed and consolidated, playing a strong guarantee role for the production increase plan.

　　The work of improving agricultural technology in various places has been gradually carried out on the basis of continuous consolidation of labor mutual aid organizations, and great achievements have been made, mainly in changing the previous rough farming methods and achieving intensive farming. For example, during spring plowing, most of the soybean, wheat, and other seeds in various places were re-selected and disinfected. More than one million mu of high-quality variety promotion areas have been established in the whole region, and the cultivated varieties can be used for sowing 8 million to 10 million mu next year. The fertilized area in various places has also expanded by 10 percent compared to last year. In many areas, in addition to fertilizing before cultivation, topdressing was also applied in summer. This spring, various places have also planned to promote improved agricultural tools and focused on promoting new agricultural tools. This year, a total of more than 47,000 improved agricultural tools have been promoted in the whole region, which has generally improved the farming efficiency in various places. For example, farmers who use the combined shovel weeding machine have met the requirements of more shoveling and more weeding. This year, 42 mutual aid groups in Northeast China used a full set of mechanical agricultural tools, which not only improved production, but also promoted the rapid consolidation of mutual aid organizations. In this way, a good influence on new agricultural tools has been established among the vast number of peasants.

　　With the needs of agricultural production recovery and development, the work of livestock epidemic prevention and livestock breeding has also been strengthened this year. In the first half of the year, more than 3.7 million cattle and horses were vaccinated, basically curbing the epidemic of livestock diseases and reducing the mortality rate of draught animals. After improving feeding and mating methods, the breeding rate of livestock has increased significantly. This year, the breeding rate of horses has increased by 6 percent and the breeding rate of cattle has increased by 3 percent. There are now 12 state-owned stud farms in the region, and more than 40,000 head of breeding livestock have been selected.

　　This year, the Northeast People's Government invested a total of more than 100,000 tons of grain in water conservancy construction, mobilizing more than 12 million laborers, and completed the river management project with a total length of more than 3,000 kilometers, making more than 7.5 million mu of cultivated land along the river free from floods, and also played a great role in completing this year's agricultural production plan.

　　加强劳动互助·改进生产技术
    东北农作物普遍增产
    粮食总产量可达一千七百八十二万吨，超过计划百分之六。
    【新华社沈阳十二日电】东北农民现正加紧秋收，东北区今年巨大的农业生产计划即将全部实现。
    东北全区今年的播种面积已扩大到一亿六千二百余万亩，比去年增加六百余万亩，已接近了“八一五”前最高的播种面积。其中对经济建设有巨大意义的商品粮食和工业原料作物的播种面积，均有显著的增加。如大豆播种面积比去年增加百分之二十二；小麦播种面积也增加百分之二十二；水稻增加到三百余万亩，已达到伪满时期的最高面积；棉花则已超过伪满时期的最高面积。达到二百五十八万亩。其他麻类、甜菜等的播种面积都比往年为多。
    今年东北秋收平均达八成半左右，每亩平均产量约为二百四十余斤（原粮），比原计划产量提高了百分之五点八，比伪满时期最高产量提高了百分之六。今年东北水稻总产量超过伪满最高产量百分之二十九，小麦超过百分之四十，棉花则超过了今年的计划产量，达到十五万四千八百吨。预计今年东北六省粮食总产量可达到一千七百八十二万吨，超过计划百分之六。
    东北农业生产获得迅速提高的重要条件，是人民政府积极地加强了劳动互助组织，并且有步骤地改进了农业生产技术。自去冬东北人民政府高岗主席提出“组织起来，多打粮食，胜过单干”的口号后，各地就进一步明确地认识了组织换工互助的目的，认真地纠正了各种强迫命令的偏向。今春开始，各地掀起了互助组与单干户的热烈竞赛运动。各地的区村干部、共产党员与劳动模范均积极带头领导生产。同时，人民政府又给予广大农民特别是互助组以各种物质帮助，使互助组织获得了极大的发展和巩固。对增产计划起了有力的保证作用。
    各地农业技术的改进工作，在劳动互助组织不断巩固的基础之上逐步进行，已有很大成绩，主要是改变了以往粗糙的耕作方法，实现了精耕细作。如在春耕中，各地大豆、小麦等种子大部分经过复选和消毒。全区共建立了一百余万亩优良品种推广区，所培育的品种可供明年播种八百万至一千万亩之用。各地的施肥面积亦比去年扩大百分之十，许多地区除耕种前施肥外，夏季还上了追肥。南满若干地区今年上追肥的面积达到百分之六十。今春以来，各地并有计划地推广了改良农具和有重点地推广了新农具。全区今年共推广四万七千余具改良农具，使各地的耕作效率普遍提高。如使用联合号铲趟机的农民，都作到了多铲多趟的要求。今年东北区有四十二个互助组使用全套机械农具，不但提高了生产，而且促进了互助组织的迅速巩固。这样，就在广大农民中建立了对新农具的良好影响。
    随着农业生产恢复和发展的需要，各地牲畜防疫和牲畜繁殖的工作，今年也加强了。上半年，仅受防疫注射的牛马即有三百七十余万头，基本上遏止了牲畜的疫病流行，减少了耕畜死亡率。改进饲养和交配方法后，牲畜的繁殖率显著增加了。今年马的繁殖率提高了百分之六，牛的繁殖率提高了百分之三，现在全区共有公营种畜场十二处，已选出种畜四万余头。
    东北人民政府今年对水利建设的投资共达粮食十万余吨，动员民工达一千二百余万，完成了总长达三千余公里河流的治水工程，使沿河七百五十余万亩耕地免除水患，对完成今年农业生产计划也起了很大的作用。
