Xinhua News Agency, 12th: TASS Moscow dispatch: "Pravda" correspondent in Pyongyang, Bochengke, in an article, describes the heinous crimes committed by the American invading army in Seoul, and the invincible angry resistance of the people of Seoul.

Bochengke writes: All the refugees who have escaped from the hell of Seoul speak of the unprecedented atrocities of the invading army. Bochengke writes: We saw two elderly men—a doctor and an engineer. These unfortunate elders spoke of terrible and heartbreaking events. MacArthur made a promise to American soldiers, saying that after the occupation of Seoul, American soldiers could move freely in the city for three days. The American soldiers used MacArthur's promise to treat Korean girls as their property. They raped those girls, and then auctioned them off on the streets, exchanging their victims for whiskey or cigarettes, and using them as stakes when gambling.

The Americans regarded not only the soldiers of the Korean People's Army as enemies, but also the civilians. They murdered every Korean who expressed sympathy for democracy. In Seoul, there is no food, no electricity, no water, all the best buildings and bridges have been razed to the ground, and hospitals and schools have also been destroyed. Seoul has been reduced to ruins. When the soldiers of Syngman Rhee began the "restoration" work, they started by repairing the prisons, and now thousands of patriotic men are dying in the prisons.

The Americans hung the blue flag of the United Nations, with blood-stained hands, on the burnt-down residence of the former Japanese Governor-General. But in less than twenty-four hours, the embers and soot blackened it. Now, that black flag of mourning is fluttering over the city.

Bochengke emphasizes: The Americans seized Seoul, but they failed to conquer the living soul of Seoul. Hand grenades were thrown into the houses occupied by these executioners. Every day, several kilometers of telephone lines are cut off, cars roll down the slopes, and stacks are set on fire. In the morning, American officers often find that the sentries have been stabbed to death, the knives piercing their shoulder blades—this is the people's court and the punishment of justice. Leaflets printed in Seoul appear on the walls, calling on the people to wage a decisive struggle against enslavement, destruction, and starvation. These leaflets remind people that patriotic men have not handed over their weapons, but are living and working in the city.

The Americans implement a hostage system in order to break the people's resistance. If an American soldier is killed, they shoot twenty-five Koreans. They attempt to extinguish the spreading flames of popular anger with the blood of patriotic men. However, blood cannot extinguish the flames, but instead makes the flames more vigorous. Resistance is growing, and the Americans are forced to leave the city overnight, because in the city, there are angry bullets shooting out of the windows of those empty houses, and deadly knives waiting for them in every corner. But even outside the city, the invaders cannot rest easy. American newspapers boast, claiming that the People's Army has been surrounded and annihilated, but it is these columns of the People's Army that are constantly appearing on the roads. The People's Army troops fighting in the south are approaching the front line in an organized manner with artillery and tanks, disintegrating the American army's rear along the way, and using the American army's food and fuel.

Bochengke concludes: The shattered, blood-stained Seoul has resisted the constant attacks of the fully armed intervention army, and continues to fight.

    血染的汉城继续战斗着
    美国人夺取到汉城，但是他们没有能够征服汉城的活的灵魂。
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：《真理报》驻平壤记者波诚科在一篇文章中，描叙美国侵略军在汉城所犯的穷凶极恶的罪行，以及不可征服的汉城人民的愤怒的抵抗。
    波诚科写道：从汉城地狱逃出来的一切难民，都说起侵略军空前未闻的暴行。波诚科写道：我们看见两个老年人——一个医师和一个工程师。这些不幸的父老谈起可怖的伤心事。麦克阿瑟对美国兵提供过诺言，说占领了汉城以后，美国兵可以在这城市中自由行动三天。美国兵利用麦克阿瑟的这句诺言，就将朝鲜少女视为他们的财产。他们奸污那些少女，然后就在街头上将她们辗转拍卖，他们将他们的牺牲品拿去交换威士忌酒或香烟，他们在打牌的时候用她们做赌注。
    美国人不仅把朝鲜人民军的战士们视为敌人，而且也把平民视为敌人。他们杀害对民主表示同情的每一个朝鲜人。在汉城，没有食品，没有电，没有水，所有一切最好的建筑和桥梁都被夷平了，医院和校舍也都被破坏了。汉城已沦于废墟中。李承晚的士兵们在开始“恢复”工作时，先从修理监狱着手，目前已有几千名爱国志士在监狱中奄奄待毙。
    美国人用血污的手把联合国蓝色的旗帜，悬挂在已被烧毁的前日本总督的官邸上。但不到二十四小时，火烬和煤烟就把它熏黑了。现在，那面志哀的黑旗在城市上空招摇着。
    波诚科着重指出：美国人夺取到汉城，但是他们没有能够征服汉城的活的灵魂。手榴弹投进了被这些刽子手所霸占的房屋内。每天都有几公里长的电话线被人剪去，汽车滚到坡下去了，堆栈烧起来了。早晨，美军军官们常常发现哨兵已被人戳死，刀子把他们的肩胛骨刺穿了——这是人民的法庭和正义的惩罚。在汉城印的传单出现在墙壁上，号召人民进行决定性的斗争，以反对奴役、毁灭和饿死。这些传单提醒人们，爱国志士们不曾交出他们的武器，而是在城市中生活着、工作着。
    美国人实行人质制度，以便打破人民的抵抗。一个美国兵被人杀死，他们就枪毙二十五个朝鲜人。他们企图用爱国志士们的鲜血来熄灭日益蔓延的人民愤怒的火焰。但是，鲜血浇不熄火焰，反而使火焰更加旺盛了。抵抗日益增长着，美国人被迫出城过夜，因为在城中，有愤怒的子弹从那些空屋的窗子里射出来，有一击就送命的刀子埋伏在每一个角落里等着他们。但是，就连在城外，侵略者们也不能安寝。美国报纸自吹法螺，硬说人民军已被包围歼灭了，然而就是这些人民军的纵队不断地出现在道路上。在南方作战的人民军部队，有组织地带着大炮和坦克逼近前线，沿途瓦解着美军的后方，使用美军的军粮和燃料。
    波诚科结语中说：破灭的血染的汉城，抵御了浑身武装的干涉军的不断的攻击，并在继续战斗着。
