　　CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee Rectification Report
    Chen Yi
    (I) What is the Main Purpose of This Rectification?
    In his "June 6th" report at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao put forward the task of rectification for the whole Party. He wrote: "The whole Party should, in the summer, autumn, and winter of 1950, conduct a large-scale rectification movement in close combination with, and not separated from, the various work tasks. By reading designated documents, summarizing work, analyzing situations, and unfolding criticism and self-criticism, we should raise the ideological and political levels of cadres and ordinary Party members, overcome errors in work, overcome the pride and complacency of being a meritorious person, overcome bureaucracy and commandism, and improve the relationship between the Party and the people."
    This instruction indicates that the main purpose of the rectification is to mobilize the whole Party to master the method of criticism and self-criticism to improve the level of cadres and Party members, and to overcome various errors in work. The central requirement is to improve work style to achieve the goal of improving the relationship between the Party and the people. Shanghai's Party rectification movement is now beginning universally. I would like to reiterate Chairman Mao's instructions on the current Party rectification, which is to require comrades participating in the rectification work to concentrate their energy on improving work style, improving work, and strengthening the Party's ties with the people, and not to deviate from this main purpose.
    Under the call of Chairman Mao's rectification and the deployment and direct assistance of the East China Bureau, and with reference to the rectification experience of Party organizations across the country, the Shanghai Party organization began its rectification work in August. Over the past month and a half, through rectification mobilization, the establishment of cadre rectification training courses, the beginning of document study by cadres in their positions, and the deliberation and self-examination of Party committees and Party groups at all levels, generally speaking, the rectification work has moved from the initial stage to the stage of practical work inspection and summary. The review and improvement of current work is being carried out enthusiastically and in an orderly manner. In particular, self-criticism between superiors and subordinates, between colleagues, and between Party and non-Party comrades is developing and deepening. In order to prevent deviations and ensure the in-depth movement and completion of the rectification task, the Municipal Party Committee has the responsibility to submit a rectification report to all comrades in Shanghai. This report only includes solving several controversial policy and ideological issues in Shanghai's work, while reviewing work style and proposing future work directions, and does not intend to involve general issues in Shanghai's work. After the Municipal Party Committee and relevant departments reported for a week, a preliminary summary was made, and I was entrusted to present the rectification report on behalf of the Municipal Party Committee as the basis for the rectification of all comrades in Shanghai. I hope that this report can help comrades reach a consensus on several major issues and ensure that the construction of New Shanghai can be carried out on a better foundation of gradually improving policy and ideology.
    (II) Shanghai's Work Should Shift to the Stage of In-depth Management and Transformation
    The first requirement of the Municipal Party Committee for the rectification of the Shanghai Party organization is to review the grasp of policies and guidelines. At the beginning of Shanghai's liberation, imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek gang repeatedly predicted that our Party would not be able to take over Shanghai well, and even predicted that Shanghai, under the leadership of our Party, would go to chaos and destruction if it did not succumb to imperialism. They also attempted to promote Shanghai's destruction by means of blockade and bombing. However, in the past sixteen months, a relatively good situation has emerged in Shanghai, refuting the predictions of the imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek gang. Their bombing and blockade have been broken, and the situation of Shanghai's industry and commerce, after overcoming the difficulties twice in October last year and February, March, and April this year, has embarked on a normal road of being able to maintain and enter recovery. The Chinese people can indeed live better without relying on imperialism, and the road of self-reliance to overcome difficulties is viable. This truth has been powerfully proven in Shanghai. This is the overall achievement in work, and this achievement should not be underestimated, because it is a major event in the construction of New China. This is due to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the CPC Central Committee, and the Central People's Government, and also to the joint efforts of all Communist Party members in Shanghai and the people of Shanghai under the direct leadership of the East China Bureau.
    The basic reason for obtaining achievements lies in the fact that our Party's policy and guidelines for taking over and building Shanghai are correct. The policy of taking over Shanghai adopted the method of leaving things as they were and gradually transforming them. When the imperialist Chiang Kai-shek gang's blockade arrived, the correct six major tasks were proposed to resist and break the enemy's blockade. This spring, when the bombing and blockade in February, March, and April further aggravated the difficulties in Shanghai's economic situation, concrete steps were taken in coordination with the takeover policy to promote labor-capital consultation, self-reliance, and joint efforts to overcome difficulties and maintain production. Relying on the support of the whole country for Shanghai, while Shanghai also worked hard to fulfill its obligations to the whole country, this further united the people of Shanghai to overcome the difficulties and gradually moved industry and commerce from maintaining to recovering. This series of policies and guidelines is correct. Our Party implemented this policy in Shanghai, not by working in a generalized manner, but by adopting appropriate methods according to the specific conditions of Shanghai. A lot of practical work has been done, and in many aspects, it has achieved results. I will not list the specific achievements in work here.
    If it is believed that our Party in Shanghai is only implementing the policy of taking over as it was, that nothing has changed, or that too little has changed, and therefore is dissatisfied, and therefore requires using drastic, vigorous, and rash methods to replace the policy of steady progress, then that is a manifestation of reckless, rash, and "leftist" behavior, which the Party cannot agree to. If, because the takeover situation is good, it is believed that everything can "follow the old ways," and that the old systems and old institutions left in Shanghai by imperialism and domestic reactionaries can be retained for a long time to perform their tasks of serving the people, then this right-leaning view of inheriting and following old practices is also something the Party cannot agree to. The Municipal Party Committee has resolved to implement Chairman Mao's instructions at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee to guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and to oppose stagnation, to carry out the struggle on two fronts to correctly implement our Party's policy of building New Shanghai, and to shift Shanghai's work from gradually ending the takeover state to the stage of in-depth management and transformation. This is the first requirement of the Shanghai Party organization in rectification.
    The second requirement of rectification is to correctly understand the consistency of policies and tasks, and to correct the erroneous observation method of opposing policies and tasks. The Party proposes concrete struggle or construction tasks based on policies. Tasks are the concrete embodiment of policies. They organically express the consistency of conforming to the interests of the people. If deviations are expressed in the implementation of tasks, the focus should be on examining the manner and method of execution, and not on pushing it to the formulation of policies and the planning of tasks. The policies and tasks are proposed with emphasis on taking care of the generality of the whole country or the whole of Shanghai, and it is impossible to completely adapt to the specific circumstances of each part. If it does not fit the specific situation, the local organization or the executor should make a lively adjustment that both suits the situation and meets the basic requirements of the task, without violating the basic requirements of the policy and task. In the past, the Municipal Party Committee has done this in the spirit of implementing the policies and tasks prescribed by the Central Committee and the East China Bureau. The task of building New China is unprecedentedly arduous and is no less than the task of revolutionary war in the past. Our Party must persuade the people to work hard to bear the task of construction, just as they bore the task of joining the army, paying grain, and producing grass to support the front in the past. Most people can understand the truth that bearing the task is serving themselves. Even if the task is heavy, as long as we patiently persuade, the people are willing to undertake the task. For the New China that is entering construction, it cannot be required that the task be light. The heavy task is an inevitable phenomenon and is a reflection of construction moving forward. Our Party comrades have a responsibility to explain to the people the truth that they should bear the task, and they must never use this as an excuse to implement coercive orders on the people. The shortcomings and errors in Shanghai's work in the recent period are not in the task itself, but in the manner of execution. The Municipal Party Committee suggests that the Shanghai Party can improve the unified understanding of the consistency of policies and tasks through rectification, and that the manner and methods of execution should be reviewed to ensure that policies can be correctly implemented and tasks can be completed in the future.
    The third requirement of the Shanghai rectification is to stop the chaotic state in organizational relationships and in the working relationships of various departments. For example, some comrades complain that there are too many clues and that there are too many vertical systems. Some comrades complain that they have too little control and that another system is hindering them. Some comrades either complain that others are not helping him, or complain that they are not notified of anything, and thus a relatively common voice arises: "Can you unify a little less, concentrate a little less, can you have fewer systems and departments?" "Don't come to hinder my work. I am a vertical system and I am acting on orders. I have no direct relationship with you. Please invade my work scope less." The Municipal Party Committee believes that in the rectification, the above two one-sided emphases should be analyzed and corrected politically and organizationally to stop the chaos in this regard. First, it should be stated politically and organizationally that in order to obey the interests of national unity, many local affairs should be more centralized in the central government, which is necessary. Therefore, it is also necessary for various departments of the Central People's Government to set up a number of directly affiliated offices in Shanghai. Shanghai's Party organization should stand on the position of supporting unified centralization to provide political and organizational assistance to the various representative organs of the central government in Shanghai, and should not hinder or interfere with them. At the same time, it must stand on the Party's position and, for the benefit of the work, persuade the principals of these organs to understand that they must be good at obtaining the cooperation of the local Party and the people, otherwise, working alone and not paying attention to contact and cooperation will not do the job well. By taking all aspects into account, the chaotic phenomenon of crisscrossing can be stopped. Second, it should be understood that the actual task of building New China is the task of industrialization. Shanghai has a certain importance in the national road to industrialization. In order for our Party to be competent to grasp the leadership of Shanghai's industry, it must first admit that the industrial structure is extremely complex and cannot be required to be as simple as in the countryside. Gears and belts, prime movers and various workshops, large screws and small screws are all created through complex procedures to create complex associations. The main task is to carry out scientific division of labor and adjustment. Here, it is necessary to conduct specialized and specific research, accumulate experience from practical work, and move from unfamiliarity to familiarity. Complaining and recklessness cannot solve the problem. The Municipal Party Committee believes that both the vertical system and the local Party leadership system should stand in the correct position to engage in mutual review and achieve division of labor and cooperation under the unified leadership of the Party's policy. This is the third requirement for improving Shanghai's work in the rectification.
    The Municipal Party Committee should make a self-criticism for the above issues. The Municipal Party Committee believes that due to the complexity of Shanghai's situation, our investigation and research are not specific and in-depth enough, and our study and understanding of the policies and prescribed tasks of the Central Committee and the East China Bureau are not sufficient. Therefore, there are still shortcomings in the grasp of policies and guidelines. The main shortcomings are that the research and transmission work is not sufficient, the systematic persistence and implementation are poor, the ability to create specific methods in conjunction with the actual situation is poor, and the experience in urban work is insufficient, and it is entangled in many temporary surprise tasks. Therefore, in general, the takeover time has been dragged out particularly long, so that the conditions for in-depth transformation in many departments have been delayed until now. This is a concrete manifestation of insufficient leadership maturity, and this should be the responsibility to the Party and the people. At the same time, the provisions of certain specific tasks lack thorough deployment and discussion in advance, and there is a tendency to engage in rash actions, and some responsibility should of course be borne for the deviations that occur during the execution below. The Municipal Party Committee's experience and knowledge are still not enough to grasp the leadership of the complex Shanghai industry and commerce. Only by studying hard and striving for progress can we improve the above situation.
    In short, Shanghai's work should shift from the beginning of the takeover to the stage of in-depth transformation, but it should still not adopt rash and impetuous methods, but should conduct in-depth research to correct the phenomenon of stagnation, to achieve gradual in-depth and gradual improvement, so that the role of Shanghai in the national life can be brought into play to a greater extent. We should recognize that Shanghai is still the economic center of the country today, and it is also located on the front line of national defense. The situation is complex, the work is wide, and the reorganization of the economic structure and the transformation of ideology cannot be achieved in a short period of time. We require all comrades to be more cautious in implementing the policies of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee, and to move steadily forward to achieve newer victories.
    (III) Shanghai's Work Should Establish a Correct Style of Connecting with the People
    The Municipal Party Committee believes that the fourth requirement of the Shanghai Party organization in the rectification lies in improving leadership style, opposing bureaucracy, opposing commandism, opposing formalism, overcoming the complacency of being a meritorious person, and correcting the handicraft style.
    The bureaucracy of many comrades in Shanghai in their work is specifically manifested in their lack of understanding of the specific situation, their lack of close contact with the lives of the masses, and their promotion of work based on subjective imagination, being high above, and arranging work in the office only based on documents, orders, forms, and meetings. Since documents, orders, forms, meetings, and reports have been made, everything is fine. As for whether their work has an impact on actual life or whether it conforms to the interests of the people, this is something that some of our staff members are indifferent to. Documents, orders, and forms are piled up like mountains, enough to satisfy and intoxicate them. They do not care about the improvement and transformation of actual life. Such typical bureaucracy is common in Shanghai. The masses reflect that we are "multi-headed and multi-minded, making people at a loss," reflecting that we are "busy and chaotic, the busier we are, the more chaotic we are, and the more chaotic we are, the busier we are," reflecting that we have "many documents, many resolutions, many instructions, many meetings, few ways to work, little concrete help, and little work done." These reflections are the correct criticism of the bureaucracy of the masses, and we should accept them. I believe that this is closely related to our emphasis on leaving things as they were since the takeover, and our failure to emphasize, or insufficient emphasis, on in-depth work in a timely manner, so that many staff members are submerged in the office all day long, inheriting and utilizing the old forms, and succumbing to the old forms. The way to correct bureaucracy is to emphasize going deep among the masses and carrying out work according to the demands of the broad masses. Whether or not actual life has been changed and improved should be used as a yardstick for checking work. As early as 1933, when Chairman Mao personally conducted a work survey in Changgang Township, Xingguo County, Jiangxi, he correctly pointed out: "Now, among the staff of the upper-level government, we encounter this situation: we can issue many orders and resolutions, but we do not know the actual content of the work of any township government or municipal government. Comrades, this is not acceptable, this is bureaucracy, this is an obstacle to work!" He also wrote: "Now, serious mistakes of perfunctory and forceful orders have occurred in the government organs in many places. The relationship between these governments and the masses is very bad, which greatly hinders the implementation of their tasks and plans." He also wrote: "The most effective way to oppose bureaucracy is to show them living examples." He also wrote: "The characteristic of Changgang Township's work is that it can use all its strength to mobilize the masses, and use extreme patience to persuade the masses. As a result, it can fully realize their tasks and strive for the fastest speed." (See Mao Zedong's Selected Works, Northeast Edition, pages 104 to 110) Chairman Mao's instructions on correcting bureaucracy seventeen years ago still have authoritative guiding significance for Shanghai's work seventeen years later. Following his method of going deep among the masses, learning from the masses, and collecting and organizing the experience of the lower levels, bureaucracy is guaranteed to be corrected!
    The commandism of many comrades in Shanghai in their work is characterized by the fact that these cadres, Party members, and self-proclaimed advanced elements are accustomed to replacing the conscious willingness of the masses with their own subjective will, relying solely on administrative orders, or using the methods of notices and struggle meetings to force the masses into action. Instead of launching mass movements, they forcibly ordered the masses to move, resulting in a series of behaviors that fatigued the masses, replaced the masses, forced the masses, and abused the masses. When the masses resisted and were dissatisfied with commandism, they shouted "the masses are backward," "the masses cannot be mobilized at all," and "the Shanghai masses are not as good as the masses in the old areas" and other bureaucratic remarks that abused and slandered the masses. The way to correct commandism is to first put down the stinky airs of "self-proclaimed advanced elements" and "self-proclaimed veterans," mobilize them to become politically conscious, understand that they are not more intelligent than the masses, and go to the masses first to learn from the masses. The broad masses are a vast sea of ​​wisdom, and you are sure to gain something by joining it to learn. If you have a predetermined task to bring down, you must first consult with the masses to solicit their opinions, obtain a broader consensus, and then jointly decide and do it together, and all work can be done well. The key to correcting commandism lies in whether to admit the great initiative of the broad masses' conscious willingness, whether to admit that the knowledge and experience of our staff are very limited, and that we can only improve ourselves by learning from the masses, and more importantly, to clarify whether you are serving the masses yourself, or whether the masses are serving you.
    Another shortcoming of many comrades in Shanghai in their work is the empty talk of formalism. All work stagnates on slogans and slogans, which are passed down level by level, but float in the air and do not touch reality. The interests of these comrades are concentrated on big calls and temporary rushes, and they think that the form is rich and beautiful, but the content is very empty. They can shout for a long time "to develop production," but they have not approached the workers to study and learn production knowledge. They can shout for a long time "to strengthen learning and improve culture," but they have not found the actual steps of learning and seriously carried them out. They can shout for a long time "to go deep, to start solving concrete problems, and to give practical help to the lower levels," but their feet and hands are always placed in the office, and they do nothing except meetings and signing documents. They can stipulate morning exercises, two hours of self-study, and eight hours of office work, plus several meetings at night. After such a timetable is rigidly enforced, no one cares about how it affects the actual work? How about the real achievements in learning? Can we consider more appropriate methods? The formalistic empty talkers are not interested in paying attention to these. All work should start from the specific inspection of its content. This is the best way to cure formalism. Correcting the empty talk of formalism and turning to doing practical and concrete work will be a considerable saving of Shanghai's human, material, and financial resources, and is one of the measures that can best win the support of the people.
    Among the staff in Shanghai, we often encounter some comrades who look down on non-Party members and retained personnel. Instead of patiently uniting them, they often show a sense of exclusion and discrimination, and even develop into thinking of underground Party members as "retained Party members" and thinking of worker comrades as "I liberated you," and created a strange term called "liberated workers." This fully exposes that some of our cadres do have the complacency of being a meritorious person and do not understand that all credit should be attributed to the people, the Party, Chairman Mao, and the leadership of the Central People's Government. In the great struggle of the great era, the work done by oneself is extremely limited, and errors in work are difficult to avoid in the past and present. In order to build New China, we have to deal with many new problems, and our knowledge and experience are not enough. How to learn from non-Party members and experienced people is the primary condition for our work. Pride and complacency, rejecting people thousands of miles away, are not good for work and oneself. We should think about the truth that humility benefits and pride fails. As for some non-Party friends and retained personnel, some people have also had the emotion of thinking that they are talented and unwilling to relearn. This is still a matter of persuasion and unity, and we should not take an opposing attitude.
    Naturally, the shortcomings and errors in Shanghai's work are not limited to the bureaucracy, commandism, formalism, complacency of being a meritorious person, and pride of many staff members. There are other problems, but these are indeed the main ones, which have caused damage to the work and the isolation of the Party from the people, and the impact is very large. The Municipal Party Committee has failed to expose and correct these problems in a timely manner in its leadership, or the exposure and correction are not systematic enough, so that they are still prevalent, and the Municipal Party Committee's failure to "show them living examples" is one of the main reasons. In reviewing the style of work, the Municipal Party Committee should deeply start from correcting its own bureaucratic tendencies. At the same time, it must also be mentioned that due to the complex work situation in Shanghai, the scope of work is very wide. Due to the lack of experience in working in large cities, many problems are due to the establishment of too many systems and the lack of thorough consideration, and they are engaged in rashly, so that the lower levels have to carry out stiffly. This kind of handicraft work style can only be done by one person, but can not use both hands and brains, can not start complex machines, can not grasp the key points, distinguish the size, importance, and weight, and take care of one thing and lose sight of another. These are all handicraft methods of the Municipal Party Committee leadership, which should be responsible and should be corrected.
    (IV) Adopt a Correct Attitude Towards Rectification
    The fifth requirement of the Municipal Party Committee for the Shanghai rectification is to grasp criticism and self-criticism within the Party with a correct attitude, to achieve correct analysis of the situation, correct summary of the work, and correct determination of new improvement methods for the work.
    The Municipal Party Committee believes that in the above inspection, it pointed out that in the execution of the Party's policies and tasks in Shanghai's work, some comrades have had deviations, either "left" or "right", and have had shortcomings and errors such as bureaucracy, commandism, and formalism, and have weakened the Party's ties with the people, causing losses in actual work. Of course, the Municipal Party Committee leadership should be responsible for this first, that is, the Municipal Party Committee failed to take effective steps in advance or afterwards to help cadres at all levels in a timely manner. This kind of review can at least arouse the enthusiasm and attention of the Municipal Party Committee to improve leadership and improve work in the future, at least it will not lose vigilance over work, and can liberate itself from a state of numbness. The comrades of the Municipal Party Committee certainly cannot shirk their responsibilities and push all the shortcomings and errors to the cadres at all levels. This is mainly estimated that the achievements of Shanghai's work are the main ones, and even if there are many shortcomings and errors, they can still be corrected. This is mainly estimated that most of the cadres and Party members in Shanghai are good, and are very loyal to the Party and the people, and have contributed to the execution of the Party's policies and tasks. If there are errors and shortcomings in the work, in the leadership, it is due to the lack of concrete help, and in the comrades themselves, it is either due to unconsciousness, or due to temporary negligence, or due to insufficient understanding. As long as it is pointed out, most comrades are able to correct it. This is a manifestation of the excellent qualities of us Communists to put the interests of the people first. When self-criticism raises the demands of the people's interests for us to correct shortcomings and errors, we Communists can unreservedly abandon shortcomings and errors and stand on the correct side. Even in Shanghai, there are still a few comrades who have made serious mistakes, and even some of them have committed crimes and have been expelled from the Party, but our Party still strives to salvage them in accordance with the policy of treating the illness and saving the people and learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones. For example, in Shanghai, there have indeed been a few elements whose lives were corrupted and degenerate and lost the position and integrity of a Communist Party member. The Party has given these elements ruthless punishment, but still hopes that these elements can re-awakening and give them the opportunity to correct and salvage them.
    The Municipal Party Committee believes that the Shanghai rectification review is in progress, and the above correct rectification attitude requires Party committees, Party groups, and leading cadres at all levels to take the lead in abiding by and promoting it. This is the key to the success or failure of this rectification movement. The following deviations have now occurred: The first type of people stand in a leading position and say to the lower levels, you cannot rectify the bureaucracy of us above, but I must rectify your commandism below. The second type of people stand in a subordinate position and say to the superiors, the commandism below should be the responsibility of your bureaucracy above. If bureaucracy is not rectified first, the commandism below cannot be corrected. The third type of people say that I have rectified the style, just look at how your own rectification is? The fourth type of people take a suspicious view of rectification at all. The fifth type of people think that the rectification will take at most two months, and it will pass after a hasty response. The sixth type of people attempt to solve all problems in this rectification, but put the central requirements for improving current work in a secondary aspect. The above points are all incorrect understandings of the main purpose of this rectification movement. It must be emphasized to the comrades that Chairman Mao instructed us that rectification should be linked to work and not separated from work, to analyze the situation, summarize the work, correct shortcomings and errors, and achieve the goal of improving the relationship between the Party and the people. It is clear that the purpose of this Shanghai rectification is to use the method of self-criticism between all levels to enable Shanghai's work to shift from the gradual end of the takeover to the stage of in-depth management, to deepen and improve the work, in order to strengthen the Party's ties with the people. The rectification around this center is essential and correct. Leaving this central requirement will inevitably fail to achieve the purpose of rectification. In the rectification of each unit and department in Shanghai, it is still necessary to focus on the above-mentioned shift to the in-depth management stage to find the main characteristics of the work in each department, and to concentrate the minds and talents of all comrades in the department on this central issue to consider, study, correct errors, and improve work methods, and to carry out rectification with emphasis on linking work tasks in order to help the completion of the current Party tasks. Otherwise, it will cause endless historical reviews and debates on life techniques, or avoid rectification, or adopt a perfunctory attitude, which will hinder the execution of current political tasks!
    Since the purpose of this rectification is to improve the work style and improve the current work, when the internal rectification of the Party has progressed to a certain extent, non-Party comrades and non-Party people should be attracted to participate in the work review at an appropriate time and in an appropriate manner, and humbly listen to their criticisms of our Party's work. Looking at our Party's work from the perspective of outside the Party can often discover aspects that are easily overlooked by us. This is one of the methods to help the rectification to go deep and progress. Each unit can appropriately adopt this method before the end of the rectification.
    (V) From Rectification to Future Work Plans
    The Municipal Party Committee believes that if comrades agree with the above-mentioned principles of rectification and have conducted a focused review, our rectification conclusion should be placed on strengthening future work. We propose the following work directions:
    1.  After the rectification, the Municipal Party Committee plans to focus on the main links of ideological education and policy education to improve Shanghai's work, to ensure that Shanghai's work can shift from the gradual end of the takeover to the stage of in-depth management. At the same time, it must be foreseen that the improvement of Shanghai's economic situation is only the beginning, and new difficulties and greater difficulties may occur. We must make various preparations for possible situations, so that we can always maintain initiative in leadership, unite the broad masses of people, restore and develop production, and continue to overcome difficulties in a prepared manner, and strive to maintain and strive for the continued improvement of the national financial and economic situation.
    2. After the rectification, the Municipal Party Committee plans to strengthen the work of the branches, summarize the grassroots experience, create work experience, regularly check the work, adjust the working relationships of the various departments, especially adjust the relationship between the vertical system and the horizontal leadership system, strengthen the unity and leadership of the Party, and correct phenomena such as the separation of Party and government and the separation of Party and the masses.
    3. After the rectification, the Municipal Party Committee plans to strengthen the leadership of the Party group of the Municipal Government, so that the Shanghai Municipal People's Government can further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship system politically and organizationally. The work of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government is the most important work in Shanghai. Our Party must be good at using democratic consultation methods to unite all democratic parties and all democratic strata to jointly support the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, to strive to realize the Common Program, to strive to consolidate the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, to establish and improve the various democratic systems of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, and to strive to improve the grassroots democratic power system at and below the district level.
    4. After the rectification, the Municipal Party Committee plans to strengthen the leadership of the workers' movement, the youth movement, the Democratic Women's Federation, the work of farmers in the near suburbs, and other revolutionary people's organizations. Our Party must be good at using suggestion methods so that the broad masses of people in Shanghai can consciously and willingly launch a mass movement of large-scale production more widely and deeply. The mass movement should focus on developing production, improving production organization and learning, and studying new organizational forms and new mass work methods that meet the requirements of the masses, and fully bring the enthusiasm of the mass movement into production and learning, so as to strive to continue to improve the national financial and economic situation.
    5. After the rectification, the Municipal Party Committee plans to start planning to train and promote cadres, run the Party school well, so that the cultural level and business knowledge of the old cadres can be gradually improved, so that the new cadres can continue to enhance their political consciousness and maintain their work enthusiasm, and to achieve a closer unity of the new and old cadres through mutual learning and work contact and mutual assistance, and better serve the people. The lives of cadres should still emphasize maintaining the excellent tradition of enduring hardship and hard work, opposing corruption and degeneration, and opposing corruption and waste. Of course, it is necessary to provide care and assistance to the lives of cadres under possible conditions.
    6. After the rectification, the Municipal Party Committee plans to strengthen the theoretical education of Marxism-Leninism and the education of Mao Zedong Thought for cadres throughout the city, and strengthen the education of basic knowledge of the Party and business education for ordinary Party members. The lack of high political level and lack of theory, and the lack of in-depth and analytical ability for practical work are one of the main shortcomings of the Shanghai Party. Therefore, theoretical study and propaganda work should be especially strengthened, and consideration should be given to establishing a regular propaganda system, so that propaganda work will not be submerged in temporary shock tasks for a long time. Strengthening general cultural education work should become one of the centers of the Party's propaganda work.
    7. Shanghai's military control system should be maintained in order to severely treat the reactionary remnants who attempt to restore and disrupt. However, the military control methods of various enterprises and factories should be gradually abolished, and a democratic management system for factories and enterprises should be established in a prepared and step-by-step manner to replace the military representative system, so that production work can gradually move towards normalization. Strengthen economic security work, and strictly prevent and suppress the sabotage of national wealth and production undertakings by bandits and special agents.
    8. The collective leadership and office work of the Municipal Party Committee should be especially strengthened. The work of the Municipal Committee, the Standing Committee, the various committees, and the various departments should be gradually established. The instructions of the Central Committee and the East China Bureau should be specially studied, and the situation in Shanghai should be deeply analyzed and reported at any time, in order to obtain the instructions of the Central Committee and the East China Bureau to enhance the leadership capacity of the city.
    If this rectification work can achieve results according to the planned plan, and the above eight tasks are continued to be done relatively well, the Municipal Party Committee plans to suggest that the Central Committee and the East China Bureau approve us to convene the first Party Congress of Shanghai in the spring of next year, to summarize the work achievements after the rectification, in order to decide how to execute the new glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party Central Committee next year.

    毛主席在我党三中全会“六六”报告中提出全党的整风任务，他写道：“全党应在一九五零年的夏秋冬三季，在和各项工作任务密切地相结合而不是相分离的条件之下，进行一次大规模的整风运动，用阅读若干指定文件，总结工作，分析情况，展开批评和自我批评等项方法，提高干部和一般党员的思想水平和政治水平，克服工作中所犯的错误，克服以功臣自居的骄傲自满情绪，克服官僚主义和命令主义，改善党与人民的关系。”
    这一指示说明整风的主旨在于动员全党掌握批评与自我批评的方法来提高干部和党员水平，克服工作中的各项错误，中心要求是改善作风达到改善党与人民的关系的目的。上海党的整风运动正在普遍开始，我在此首先复述毛主席对此次全党整风的指示，就是要求参加整风工作的同志能把整风精力集中在改善作风改善工作增强党与人民的联系方面，而不要离开这个主要目的。
    上海的共产党组织，在毛主席整风号召之下，在华东局的整风部署和直接帮助之下，并且参考全国各地党组织的整风经验，从八月起开始了整风工作。一个半月来，通过了整风动员，开办干部整风训练班，开始在职干部的文件学习，和各级党委、党组的酝酿和检讨，一般说来整风工作业已从开始的阶段进入到实际工作的检查和总结的阶段，对于当前工作的检讨与改进正在热烈地和有秩序地进行着。特别是上下级间、同级间、党与非党同志间的自我批评正在发展和深入；为了防止偏差，保证运动的深入和完成整风任务，市委有责任向上海全体同志提出市委的整风报告，这个报告仅包括解决上海工作中几个有争执的政策思想的问题，同时检讨工作作风和提出今后工作方向，不拟涉及上海工作中一般性的问题。经过市委与各有关部门一周来的汇报，作出了初步总结，委托我代表市委提出整风报告，作为上海市全体同志整风的依据。我希望这个报告能帮助同志们在几个主要问题上取得一致，保证新上海的建设能在政策思想逐步提高的更好的基础上去进行。
    （二）上海工作应该转入深入管理改造的阶段
    市委对上海党组织的整风首先要求检讨政策方针的掌握方面。上海解放之初，帝国主义和蒋匪帮曾多次预言我党不能把上海接管好，更预言上海在我党领导之下如不屈从帝国主义要走向混乱和毁灭，他们并且企图以封锁和轰炸的方法来促使上海走向毁灭。但十六个月来，在上海出现了比较良好的情况，驳斥了帝国主义和蒋匪帮的预言，其轰炸封锁业已被打破，上海工商业情况经过去年十月今年二、三、四月两度困难被克服之后，业已走上比较能够维持和进入恢复的正常道路。中国人民不依赖帝国主义的确可以生活得更好，自力更生克服困难的路是走得通的，这个真理在上海得着有力的证明。这是工作方面总的成就，这个成绩不要作过低的估计，因为它对新中国建设上是一件大事。这要归功于毛主席、中共中央和中央人民政府的正确领导，也要归功于华东局直接领导下上海全体共产党员与上海人民的共同努力。
    获得成绩的基本原因，在于我党对接管上海建设上海的政策方针是正确的。接管上海的方针采取了原封不动逐步改造的办法。在帝国主义蒋匪帮封锁到来时，提出了正确的六大任务来对抗和打破敌人的封锁。今春二、三、四月轰炸封锁更加重上海经济情况的困难时，又配合接管政策，提出劳资协商自力更生，共同克服困难维持生产的具体步骤。依靠全国对上海的支援，同时上海也努力完成自己对全国应负担的义务，这样进一步团结了上海人民渡过了难关，使工商业逐渐由维持走向恢复的道路。这一系列的政策方针是正确的。我党在上海执行此方针，不是一般化地去进行工作，而是能够根据上海具体情况采取了适合的办法。实际工作做得很多，且在许多方面收了效果，我在这里对具体工作的成绩不拟一一加以叙述。
    如果认为我党在上海仅仅是原封不动的接管方针，一切没有改变，或改变太少，因而不满足，因而要求以大刀阔斧的轰轰烈烈的急进办法来代替稳步前进的方针，那就是轻躁的急进的左的表现，党是不能同意的；如果因为接管状态良好，因而认为一切可以“率由旧章”，对帝国主义和国内反动派遗留在上海的旧制度旧机构，可以长期保留，去执行其为人民服务的任务，这种因袭沿用的右倾的观点，党也是不能同意的。市委决议执行毛主席二中全会戒骄戒躁的指示和反对停滞不前，开展两条战线的斗争才能正确执行我党建设新上海的方针，把上海工作从逐步结束接管状态转入深入管理改造阶段。这是上海党组织在整风中的第一个要求。
    整风第二个要求是正确了解政策与任务的一致性，纠正把政策与任务对立起来的错误观察方法。党根据政策提出具体斗争的或建设的任务，任务是政策的具体体现，他们之间是有机地表现了符合人民利益的一致性；如在实现任务时表现有偏差，其重点应检讨执行的方式与方法，而不要推到政策的制定与任务的规划方面去。政策与任务之提出，着重照顾全国或全上海的一般性，而不可能完全适应每一局部的具体情况。如果发生与具体情况不适合时，应该由地方组织或执行人员在不违背政策与任务的基本要求之下，作既适合情况又符合任务的活泼调整。过去市委在执行中央与华东局所规定的政策与任务时，是本着这个精神去做的。新中国的建设任务，是空前艰巨的，并不比过去革命战争任务为轻，我党要说服人民努力负担建设任务，如过去负担参军、出粮、出草以支援前线一样，大多数人民是能懂得负担任务乃是替自己服务的真理的。纵使任务重，只要耐心说服，人民是愿意担负任务的。对正在进入建设的新中国，不能要求任务轻，任务之繁重乃是必然的现象，而且正是建设在前进的反映。我党同志有责任向人民说明应该负担的真理，绝不能以此借口而对人民实行强迫命令。上海工作最近时期的缺点和错误，不在于任务问题，而在于执行方式的问题。市委建议上海党能经过整风而提高政策与任务一致性的统一认识，和在执行方式方法上应进行检讨，保证今后能正确地去执行政策与完成任务。
    上海整风的第三个要求，是停止在组织关系上和各部工作关系上的混乱状态。例如有的同志埋怨头绪太多，埋怨垂直系统太多，有的同志埋怨自己管得太少，埋怨另一系统的牵掣，有的同志或者埋怨别人对他不帮助，或者埋怨什么事都不通知他等，因而发生比较普遍的呼声：“你们是否少统一一点，少集中一点，你们是否把系统部门少搞一点。”“你不要来妨害我的工作，我是垂直系统，奉命办事，我对你没有直属关系，你少来侵犯我的工作范围。”市委认为在整风中应该从政治上组织上对上述两种片面的强调，加以分析和指正，来停止在这方面的混乱。第一、在政治上组织上应该说明为了服从国家统一的利益，许多地方事权应该更多集中在中央，这是必要的，因而中央人民政府各部门在上海设了若干直属的办事机关也是必要的；上海党的组织应该站在拥护统一集中的立场予中央在上海的各个代表机关以政治上的组织上的帮助，而不要去妨害和干涉，同时又要站在党的立场为了工作有利，说服这些机关的主持人，懂得善于取得当地党与人民的配合，否则单独干，不注意联系配合，工作是做不好的。这样统筹兼顾，便可以停止纵横交错的混乱现象。第二、应该了解新中国建设任务实际是工业化的任务，上海在全国工业化的道路中有其一定重要性，我党要能胜任掌握对上海工业的领导，本身要先承认工业机构是极其复杂的，是不能要求如农村那样简单的。齿轮与轮带，原动力与各车间，大螺丝钉与小螺丝钉都是经过复杂程序造成复杂的关联，主要任务是加以科学分工和调整，在这里要作专门的具体研究，从实际工作中去积累经验，从不熟练走向熟练。抱怨与轻躁，是不能解决问题的。市委认为垂直系统与地方党的领导系统双方应站在正确立场，从事互相检讨，在党的政策的统一领导下，做到分工协作。这是整风中关于改进上海工作的第三个要求。
    市委对于上述各问题应该提出自我批判。市委认为由于上海情况的复杂，我们调查研究不够具体深入，对中央与华东局的政策和规定任务的研究体会不够，因此政策方针的掌握上仍然是有缺点的，主要是研究传达工作不够，有系统坚持与贯彻差，配合实际创造具体办法差，以及城市工作经验不够，并且为许多临时突击任务所缠绕，因而在总的方面，把接管时间拖得特别长，以致许多部门进行深入改造的条件拖迟至今未准备成熟。这是领导不够成熟的具体表现，这是应该向党与人民负责的。同时某些具体任务的规定缺乏在事前作周密的部署和讨论，存在仓猝从事的作风，对下面执行时发生偏差当然应该负一部分责任。对于掌握复杂的上海工商业的领导，市委的经验与知识还是不够的，只有努力学习，力求进步，去改善上述的情况。
    总之，上海市的工作应该从接管开始转入深入改造的阶段，但仍然不应该采取急躁冒进的办法，而应该深入研究纠正停滞不前的现象，做到逐步深入，逐步提高，把上海市在全国生活的作用更高度发挥起来。我们应认识上海到今天仍是全国的经济中心，又是处在国防前线，情况复杂，工作方面广阔，经济机构的改组与意识形态的改造，不是在短期内可以一蹴而就的，要求全体同志更谨慎小心执行毛主席和中央的政策，稳步前进去获得更新的胜利。
    （三）上海工作应该建立联系人民的正确作风
    市委认为上海党组织在整风中的第四个要求在于改善领导作风，反对官僚主义，反对命令主义，反对形式主义，克服功臣自居骄傲自满的情绪，和纠正手工业作风。
    上海许多同志在工作中的官僚主义，具体表现在他们不了解具体情况，不与群众生活密切联系，凭主观想像来推行工作，高高在上，坐在机关内但凭文书、命令、表格、会议来布置工作。既然文书、命令、表格、会议和报告已经作了，便万事大吉，至于自己的工作对实际生活是否有影响，是否符合人民利益，这对我们某些工作人员是漠不关心的。文书、命令、表格堆积如山，足够使他们自己满足和陶醉，实际生活的提高改造他们可管不着。这样的官僚主义典型在上海是常见的事。群众中反映我们“多头多脑，使人无所适从”，反映我们“忙忙乱乱，愈忙愈乱，愈乱愈忙”，反映我们“文件多，决议多，指示多，会议多，工作的办法少，具体帮助少，工作做得少”。这些反映正是群众官僚主义的正确批判，我们应该接受。我以为这与我们接管以来强调原封不动，对深入工作未能及时强调，或强调不够，以致许多工作人员，终日沉没于机关里因袭利用旧形式，屈从旧形式，是有其重要关联的。纠正官僚主义的办法便是强调深入群众，根据广大群众要求来进行工作。以改变和提高实际生活与否作为检查工作的尺度。远在一九三三年毛主席亲自进行江西兴国县长冈乡的工作调查时，即正确指出说：“现在上级政府工作人员中我们遇得到这样的情形：发得出很多的命令与决议，却不知道任何一个乡政府市政府工作的实际内容。同志们，这是不行的，这是官僚主义，这是工作的障碍！”他又写道：“现在许多地方的政府机关中发生了敷衍塞责或者强迫命令的严重错误，这些政府同群众的关系十分不好，大大障碍了他们的任务与计划的执行。”他又写道：“反对官僚主义最有效方法，就是拿活的榜样给他们看。”他又写道：“长冈乡工作的特点，在于能用全力去动员群众，用极大的耐心去说服群众，结果能完全实现他们的任务并且争取了最快的速度。”（见毛泽东选集东北版一○四页至一一○页）毛主席在十七年前对纠正官僚主义所提供的指示，对十七年后的上海工作仍具有权威指示的意义。依照他的办法深入群众向群众学习，收集与整理下层的经验，官僚主义是有保证可以纠正的！
    上海许多同志在工作中的命令主义，其特点，在这些干部党员和自命先进分子们惯于以自己的主观意志代替群众的自觉自愿，单纯依靠行政命令，或用通知和斗争会的办法，强迫群众进入行动，不是发动群众运动，而是强迫命令去运动群众，于是产生一系列的疲劳群众，代替群众，强迫群众，谩骂群众的脱离群众的行为。当群众发生对命令主义的反抗与不满时，于是又高喊“群众落后”，“群众是根本发动不起来的”，“上海群众不如老区群众好”等谩骂群众诋毁群众的官僚言论。纠正命令主义的办法，首先是放下“自命先进分子”“自命老资格”的臭架子，动员他们在政治上觉悟起来，懂得自己并不比群众高明，先要到群众中去，先向群众学习。广大群众是一个广阔无边的智慧之海，你加入其中去学习是一定有收获的；如果你有预定的任务带下去，一定先同群众商量征求群众意见，取得更广泛的一致，然后共同决定共同去做，如是一切工作均可以做得好。纠正命令主义的关键在于是否承认广大群众的自觉自愿的伟大的积极性，在于是否承认我们工作人员的知识经验是很有限的，只有经过向群众学习才能把自己提高，更在于要弄清究竟是你自己替群众服务，还是要群众来替你自己服务。
    上海许多同志在工作中另一缺点便是形式主义的空喊，一切工作停顿在标语口号上面，按级往下传，但是浮在空中不接触实际。这些同志的兴趣集中在大的号召，临时突击，视其形式既丰富且漂亮，究其内容则十分空洞。可以喊得很久“要发展生产”，可是没有去接近工人作生产知识的研究与学习。可以空喊很久“要加强学习，提高文化”，可是没有找出实际学习的步骤，认真去进行。可以喊得很久“要深入，要着手解决具体问题，要给下面以实际帮助”，可是脚与手老是摆在机关内，除开会议与签署文件而外，别的事什么也不作。可以规定早操，自学两小时，办公八小时，再加上夜间几次会议，这样一个时间表硬性做下去，便无人过问对实际工作影响如何？真正在学习上的成就如何？是否可以考虑更妥善的办法呢？在形式主义的空喊家便毫无兴趣去理会这些了。一切工作要从其内容的具体检查着手，这是医治形式主义的最好办法。纠正了形式主义的空喊，转入做实际的具体的工作，对于上海的人力物力财力的节省将是很可观的，是最能取得人民拥护的措施之一。
    在上海工作人员中，经常遇见某些同志，看不起党外人士，看不起留用人员，不是耐心去团结他们，而常常表现一种排斥和歧视的情绪，甚至发展到对地下党员认为是“留用党员”，对工人同志认为是“我把你们解放出来的”，成立了一个怪名词叫“解放工人”。这是充分暴露了我们某些干部中确实存在着功臣自居骄傲自满的情绪，不了解一切功劳应该归功人民，归功党与毛主席和中央人民政府的领导。在大时代的伟大斗争里，自己所作的一点工作是极其有限的，而在工作中错误在过去和现在都是很难避免的。为了新中国的建设要处理许多新问题，自己的知识与经验均不够，如何向党外人士，向有经验的人学习，是我们进行工作的首要条件。骄傲自满，拒人于千里之外，对工作对自己均没有好处；要从这些方面想一想谦受益、骄必败的道理。至于一部分党外的朋友和留用的人员中也有人发生过自命才高，不愿意重新学习的情绪。这仍然是一个说服团结的问题，不应该采取对立的态度。
    自然上海工作中的缺点和错误不限于许多工作人员的官僚主义、命令主义、形式主义、功臣自居、骄傲自满等几项，还有其他的毛病，但这几项确是占主要地位，已造成工作的损害和党与人民的隔离，其影响是很大的。市委在领导上对这几种毛病未能及时揭发和纠正，或者揭发纠正不够有系统，以致仍然流行，而市委领导上“拿不出活榜样给他们看”更是主要原因之一。在检讨作风上，市委应深刻从纠正自己的官僚主义倾向着手。同时还要提到由于上海工作情况复杂，工作的面很广，由于缺乏大城市工作经验，许多问题由于系统林立，缺乏周密的考虑，仓猝从事，以致让下面生硬地去进行，此种手工业的工作作风，只能单打一，不能手脑并用，不能开动复杂机器，不能抓住重点、分别大小轻重，顾此失彼，这都是市委领导上手工业方式，应该负责应该加以纠正的。
    （四）对整风应采取正确态度
    市委对上海整风的第五个要求，是以正确的态度，掌握党内的批评与自我批评，达到正确分析情况，正确总结工作，正确确定对工作的新的改进办法。
    市委认为在上述检查中指出在上海工作中，执行党的政策和任务时，有一部分同志曾经发生过或左或右的偏差，曾经发生官僚主义、命令主义、形式主义等缺点和错误，曾经削弱了党与人民的联系，造成实际工作中的损失等。这当然首先应由市委领导上负责任，即在于市委于事前或事后未能及时采取有效步骤给各级干部以帮助。这样检讨最低限度可以唤起市委在今后改进领导改进工作的热情和注意，至少不至于对工作丧失警惕，能使自己从麻痹状态中解放出来。市委各同志当然不能推卸责任，把一切缺点错误推到各级干部身上去。这主要是估计到上海工作成绩是主要的，缺点错误即使是很多，仍然是可以纠正的，这主要是估计到上海的大多数干部和党员都是好的，对党对人民都是很忠实的，都是在执行党的政策和任务上有贡献的。如果在工作上产生错误和缺点，在领导上是由于缺乏具体帮助，在同志自己或者由于不自觉，或者由于一时疏忽，或者由于理解力不够，只要一经指出，大多数同志都是能够改正的，这就是我们共产党人能以人民利益为前提的优美品质的表现。自我批评提到人民利益要求我们纠正缺点和错误时，我们共产党员便能毫无顾惜的抛弃缺点和错误站到正确方面来。就是在上海尚有少数同志犯过重大的错误，甚至其中有的人犯了罪，业已开除其党籍，但我党仍然本着治病救人惩前毖后的方针力求加以挽救。例如在上海确实产生过少数生活腐化堕落丧失共产党员立场和节操的分子，党曾经予这些分子以无情的惩处，但仍然希望这些分子能够重新觉悟，并给予改正和挽救的机会。
    市委认为上海整风检讨正在进行，对上述正确的整风态度，要求各级党委、党组和领导干部能够以身作则去遵守和推行，这是这次整风运动的成败关键。现在已发生下列偏差：第一类人是站在领导地位，对下级说你不能整我们上面的官僚主义，而我必须整你们下面的命令主义。第二类人是站在被领导地位对上级的人说，下面的命令主义应由你们上面的官僚主义负责，官僚主义不先整，下面命令主义是无法纠正的。第三类人说我已经整了风了，就看你们自己的整风如何？第四类人对整风根本采取疑惧的观点。第五类人认为整风至多两个月时间，潦潦草草应付一下便过去了。第六类人企图在这次整风中解决一切问题，反而把当前工作改进的中心要求放在次要方面去了。上述各点都是对这次整风运动的主旨了解不正确。必须着重提醒同志们，毛主席指示我们整风要与工作联系，不能与工作分离，要分析情况，总结工作，纠正缺点和错误，达到改善党与人民的关系的目的。很明显，这次上海的整风的目的，是要各级间互相用自我批评的方法达到上海工作能从接管的逐步结束转入深入管理阶段，把工作深入提高，以便加强党与人民的联系，围绕此一中心的整风乃是切要而正确的。离开此一中心要求，必然不能达到整风的目的。在上海市各单位各部门的整风，仍是围绕上述转向深入管理阶段的中心来寻找各部门工作中主要的特征，把该部门全体同志的心思才力集中在此中心问题上去作考虑，去研讨纠正错误提高工作的办法，有重点地联系工作任务去进行整风，才能对当前党的任务的完成有所帮助。否则造成无休止的历史检讨和生活技术的辩论，或者躲避整风，或者采取敷衍态度，那对当前的政治任务的执行是有妨害的！
    既然此次整风的目的是在于改进工作作风和改进当前工作，因而在党内整风进行到一定程度时，在适当时机采用适当方式吸引非党同志和党外人士来参加工作检讨，虚心听取其对我党工作的批评，从党外的角度来看我党的工作，常常能发现容易为我们所忽略的侧面，这是帮助整风深入和进展的方法之一。各单位可适当地在整风结束前采取此种方式。
    （五）从整风联系到今后工作的打算
    市委认为同志们如果同意上述整风的原则，进行了有重点的检讨之后，我们的整风结论便应该放在加强今后工作方面去。我们提出下列的工作方向：
    一、市委于整风后拟定抓住思想教育、政策教育的主要环节来改进上海工作，保证上海工作能从逐步结束接管走向深入管理阶段，同时必须预见到上海经济情况的好转还只是开始，新的困难和更大的困难还有发生的可能，必须对可能发生的情况作各种准备，如是才能在领导上随时保持主动，团结广大人民，恢复和发展生产，有准备地去继续克服困难，为保持和力争国家财经情况的继续好转而奋斗。
    二、市委于整风后拟定以加强支部工作，总结基层经验，创造工作经验，定期检查工作，调整各部工作关系，特别是调整垂直系统与横的领导系统的关系，加强党的统一和领导，纠正党政不分、党群不分等现象。
    三、市委于整风后拟加强对市府党组的领导，使上海市人民政府在政治上组织上能更进一步巩固人民民主专政制度。上海市人民政府的工作是上海市最重要的工作，我党要善于运用民主协商方法团结各民主党派各民主阶层共同协力拥护上海市人民政府，为实现共同纲领而奋斗，为巩固上海市人民政府的领导，为建立和健全上海市人民政府的各项民主制度而奋斗，为健全区级和区以下的基层民主政权制度而奋斗。
    四、市委于整风后拟加强工人运动，青年运动，民主妇联工作，近郊农民工作及其他革命人民团体的领导。我党要善于以建议方法使上海广大人民能自觉自愿地更广阔深入掀起大生产的群众运动。群众运动应该以发展生产提高生产组织学习为中心，研究适合群众要求的新的组织形式和新的群众工作方法，把群众运动的热情充分发挥到生产学习方面，为力争国家财经情况继续好转而服务。
    五、市委于整风后拟动手有计划来培养干部提拔干部，把党校办好，使老干部的文化程度与业务知识能逐步提高，使新干部能继续增强其政治觉悟，保持其工作热情，更要以互相学习和工作联系互助的办法，达成新老干部更紧密的团结更好的为人民服务。干部的生活仍旧要强调保持吃苦耐劳艰苦奋斗的优良传统，反对腐化堕落，贪污浪费。当然，在可能条件下予干部生活以照顾和帮助是必要的。
    六、市委于整风后拟加强全市干部的马列主义的理论教育和毛泽东思想的教育，加强对一般党员对党的基础知识的教育和业务教育。政治水平不高和理论缺乏，对实际工作缺乏深入和分析的能力是上海党的主要缺点之一，因此理论学习和宣教工作要特别加强，考虑建立经常的宣传制度，使宣教工作不会长期沉没在临时突击任务之中。一般文化教育工作的加强应成为党的宣教工作的中心之一。
    七、上海全市的军事管制制度应该保持，以便严厉对待企图复辟捣乱的反动残余。但各企业各工厂的军事管制办法应逐步撤消，要有准备地有步骤地建立对工厂企业的民主管理制度以代替军事代表制度，以便生产工作能逐渐走向正常化。加强经济保卫工作，严防并镇压匪特对国家财富和生产事业的破坏。
    八、市委的集体领导与机关工作应特别加强。市委会、常委会、各委员会、和各部门工作均要逐步建立起来。对中央和华东局的指示应有专门研究，对上海情况应作深刻的分析随时上报，以便取得中央和华东局的指示来增强市的领导能力。
    如果这次整风工作能按预定计划获得成绩，又继续将上述八项工作做得比较好，市委拟建议中央和华东局批准我们能于明年春季召集上海市第一次党的代表大会，来总结整风后的工作成就，以便决定明年如何来执行党中央交给我们的新的光荣任务。
