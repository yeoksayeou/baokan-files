Hebei Cotton Production Exceeds Pre-War Levels
This Year, the Province Can Harvest 3.36 Million Dan of Ginned Cotton
Cotton Farmers Enjoy Excellent Profits and Prepare to Plant Cotton on a Large Scale Next Year

[This newspaper dispatch] According to reports from our correspondents: Hebei Province, the province with the largest cotton planting area in the country, has achieved a bumper harvest in most of its cotton fields this year. Cotton farmers who have benefited greatly from planting more cotton, and people who regret planting too little or not planting cotton at all, have selected and reserved a large amount of cotton fields while planting wheat; cotton farmers in various places are also retaining excellent varieties during cotton picking, laying the foundation for increasing cotton production next year.

Hebei Province is one of the most famous cotton-producing areas in the country. This year, it planted approximately 14 million mu of cotton. After deducting the cotton fields destroyed by disasters, there are still more than 12 million mu of cotton fields. According to conservative estimates, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu in the province will be at least 30 jin. Counties with better harvests, such as Jin County, Shulu County, Zhengding County, Boye County, Cheng'an County, Lixian County, Wangdu County, Linzhang County, Zhao County, Huolu County, and the second district of Wuqing County, have an average yield of more than 100 jin of seed cotton (approximately 33 jin of ginned cotton) per mu; in some cases, it reaches 200-300 jin. The total output of the province can reach more than 3.36 million dan of ginned cotton (100 jin per dan), exceeding the pre-war level (in 1936, the province planted 10.3 million mu and produced 3 million dan of ginned cotton).

The bumper harvest of cotton has greatly improved the lives of farmers. For example, Cheng'an County can harvest an average of 130 jin of seed cotton per mu. The county planted 370,000 mu of cotton, and can harvest a total of 48.1 million jin of seed cotton. At the current market price of 3.5 jin of millet per jin of seed cotton, a total of 168.35 million jin of millet can be exchanged. With a population of 200,000 in the county, based on 60 jin of millet consumed per person per month, the income from cotton alone is enough to maintain the entire year's livelihood and have a surplus. Currently, most farmers in the county can afford to wear fine cloth clothes; even the most frugal households will buy some printed fabric to make new clothes for their children. Jin County also had a bumper cotton harvest last year. According to statistics from 1949 to the first half of 1950, farmers in the county used the money from selling cotton to purchase a total of 5,691 mules, horses, cattle, and donkeys, and 1,600 waterwheels. Buying agricultural tools and building new houses is even more common. Many farmers have put on fine cloth clothes. Zhoujiazhuang Village in the county has 7,240 mu of cultivated land, and 70 percent (5,100 mu) was planted with cotton this year. The village can harvest more than 982,000 jin of cotton, which can be exchanged for more than 19,000 shi of grain, accounting for 90 percent of the village's total income. Therefore, they can have a full year's worth of grain left over. Last year, the village planted just over 3,600 mu of cotton, and the income they earned added 111 head of livestock, and 140 old and weak livestock were replaced with strong ones, and 36 waterwheels were also added. This year they plan to purchase even more things.

Currently, new cotton has been put on the market in large quantities. In the Linqing town market, from August 20th to September 5th, 658,890 jin of ginned cotton and 660,693 jin of seed cotton were put on the market. In Cheng'an County, fourteen cotton purchasing stations have purchased 329,721 jin of ginned cotton and 617,650 jin of seed cotton in August and September. Due to the large influx of cotton into the market, the market situation in various places has become much more active than before. In Linqing Town, only about ten bolts of foreign cloth were sold per day in August, but in September, the daily sales increased to about 200 bolts. In Jin County City, only about 2,000 jin of bean cakes were sold per fair in August, but in September, the sales increased to 100,000 jin per fair. Cotton farmers who have achieved a bumper harvest are using the money from selling cotton to purchase livestock, agricultural tools, and the necessary grain and cloth in large quantities.

The bumper harvest of cotton has greatly increased the enthusiasm of farmers for planting cotton. They universally reflected: "We must plant more cotton next year." Currently, the broad masses of farmers in Hebei Province are combining the work of comparing crops, picking cotton, and planting wheat to select cotton seeds and cotton fields. Many village farmhouses have already made plans for planting cotton next year, and the area reserved for planting cotton is generally larger than this year. For example, Zhaicheng Village in Ding County planted 3,800 mu of cotton this year, and has now drawn up a plan to plant 4,800 mu of cotton next year, an increase of 1,000 mu compared to this year. Many households plan to double their cotton planting area compared to this year, and some farmers are even preparing to plant all their land with cotton. Many farmhouses have also made plans for accumulating fertilizer this year, preparing to accumulate more fertilizer in order to strive for an even better harvest next year. For example, in Huaidi Village, a suburb of Shijiazhuang City, more than 100 out of 400 households have teamed up to open 42 flour mills. They said: "We don't ask for anything else, we just want to accumulate good fertilizer and plant cotton well next year." Households who did not listen to the cadres in the spring and planted less cotton or did not plant cotton are now very regretful and said that they will plant more cotton next year.

　　河北棉产超过战前水平
    今年全省可收皮棉三百卅六万担
    棉农收益优厚准备明年大量种棉
    【本报讯】综合通讯员报道：今年全国种棉最多的省份——河北省，大部棉田获得丰收。因种棉多而收益优厚的棉农，和因种棉少或未种棉而后悔的群众都已在种麦中选留大量棉田；各地棉农并在摘棉时留优良品种，为明年增产棉花打下基础。
    河北省是全国著名产棉区之一，今年共约种棉一千四百万亩。除去因灾害被毁的棉田外，现尚存棉田一千二百余万亩。据稳重的估计，全省棉田，平均每亩至少可产皮棉三十斤，收成较好的县份如晋县、束鹿、正定、博野、成安、蠡县、望都、临漳、赵县、获鹿等县和武清二区的棉花，每亩平均产量都在一百斤籽棉（约合皮棉三十三斤）以上；多的达到二、三百斤。全省总产量可达皮棉三百三十六万担（每担一百斤）以上，已超过战前水平（一九三六年全省种一千零三十万亩，产皮棉三百万担）。
    棉花的丰收，使农民生活得到很大的改善。如成安县每亩棉花平均可摘籽棉一百三十斤。全县种棉三十七万亩，共可收籽棉四千八百一十万斤。按目前市价一斤籽棉可换小米三斤半，共可换小米一万六千八百三十五万斤。全县二十万人口，按每人每月吃小米六十斤计，仅棉花一项收入，足够维持全年生活而有余。现该县一般农民都可穿到细布衣裳；就是最俭省的农户，也要给小孩买些花洋布做件新衣。晋县去年棉花即获丰收。据一九四九年至一九五○年前半年的统计，该县农民用卖花的钱，添置骡马牛驴共五千六百九十一头，水车一千六百架。购买农具，修盖新房的更是普遍。许多农民都穿上了细布衣裳。该县周家庄全村耕地七千二百四十亩，今年百分之七十（五千一百亩）种上了棉花。全村可收花九十八万二千余斤，约可换米一万九千多石，占全村总收入的百分之九十。因此可以整整余下一年的粮食。去年该村种棉不过三千六百亩，而收益所得就添了一百一十一头牲口，一百四十头老弱牲口都换成强壮的，还添了三十六辆水车。今年他们准备添置的东西更多了。
    现在新棉已大批上市。临清镇市场，从八月二十日到九月五日，上市的皮棉六十五万八千八百九十斤；籽棉六十六万零六百九十三斤。成安县十四个收花处，八、九两月内已收购皮棉三十二万九千七百二十一斤，籽棉六十一万七千六百五十斤。由于棉花大批涌入市场，各地市场情况已较前大为活跃。临清镇八月份仅日销洋布十匹左右，九月份即日销二百匹左右；晋县城八月份每集只销豆饼二千斤左右，九月份每集却增销到十万斤。获得丰收的棉农，正用出售棉花的钱大量购买牲口、农具和必需的粮食、布匹。
    棉花丰收，使农民们的种棉情绪大为提高，普遍反映：“明年一定要多种棉花。”现河北全省广大农民正结合比庄稼、摘棉、种麦等工作，选留棉种和棉田。很多村庄农家已作出明年的种棉计划，留出的种棉面积，普遍较今年为多。如定县翟城村今年种棉三千八百亩，现已订出明年植棉四千八百亩的计划，较今年增加一千亩。很多户计划比今年种棉面积要提高一倍，有的农户并准备全部种棉。不少农家并已定出今年积肥计划，准备多积肥料，争取明年更好的丰收。如石家庄市郊槐底村，四百多户人家，已经有一百多家搭伙开起四十二座粉房，他们说：“不求别的，只求攒下好肥，明年好好种棉花。”春天未听干部的话而种棉少或未种棉的户，现在都非常后悔，表示明年一年要多种棉花。（刘崎、姚忠志、朝山、雁北、萧苑华、杨利民、苏志学、陈正今、赵志国、刘根茂、刘亚波、朱忠智、刘俊发、李柔、栗元荣、吕冠雄、李超、赵润民、赵植敏、王祯、赵诺夫、周聚山、草门佳、美玉、殿元、赵仁、玉栋、南铭、周志清、郑杰、魏建国、郭兴旺、刘保身）
