　　Celebrating the Great Achievements of the People's Republic of China in the Past Year
　　Chairman of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party Zhang Bojun
　　Today we celebrate the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which is a cause for great joy and excitement.
　　The Chinese people have always been in a position of being oppressed and exploited. In the past, they lived a life of slavery under the rule of feudal forces for a long time. In the past hundred years, they have been oppressed by imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, making it even more difficult to raise their heads and see the light of day. Although the Chinese people have carried out continuous revolutionary struggles for their independence and freedom, and shed countless blood, they have not been liberated due to the lack of correct leadership. It was not until the success of the Russian October Revolution that the gospel of true liberation was brought to the Chinese people. The Chinese proletariat and its political party, the Chinese Communist Party, grew up at this time. The broad masses of the Chinese people, united around it, through its correct leadership and arduous struggle, not only defeated the powerful Japanese imperialism, but also defeated the general representative of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, established their own government, and became the masters of their own country. The People's Republic of China was established through such a long and arduous struggle. Therefore, the Chinese people especially cherish their motherland—the People's Republic of China. Therefore, in just one year of construction, they have overcome many great difficulties and done many important and decisive works for the construction of a new China, opening up a bright future for new democracy.
　　1. China's finances and economy have never been unified, especially during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government, which was chaotic. The entire social economy was on the verge of bankruptcy, and the people were impoverished. After the establishment of the People's Government, the unified management and leadership of national finances and economy was realized within a few months, thus achieving a balance of financial revenue and expenditure, stopping inflation, stabilizing prices, overcoming disasters in vast areas, and providing relief and resettlement for a large number of unemployed people. General industry and commerce, especially in Northeast and North China, are now showing a thriving atmosphere. Large-scale production and construction work is being carried out step by step according to plan. These vigorous new scenes of national construction cannot be obtained by chance, but are due to the correct leadership of the Central People's Government and the resolute implementation of cadres at all levels, implementing the policy of taking into account both public and private interests, streamlining and saving. On the other hand, due to the enthusiastic support of all social strata and the people of the whole country, they voluntarily and consciously actively support the government with practical actions such as paying grain taxes and purchasing public bonds. This shows that today's government and people are completely united, so there will be such achievements.
　　2. The most important task in the stage of new democracy is to implement land reform, eliminate the feudal land exploitation system, liberate the productive forces of the vast countryside, develop production, and lay the foundation for socialism. This work was successfully completed last winter in the suburbs of various cities in North China and in half of Henan, with a total of more than 20 million agricultural population. At present, land reform is beginning in East China and Central South China, with a total of about 160 million agricultural population. This work, due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the enthusiastic support of all social strata, democratic parties, and the broad masses of the people, will surely be successfully completed. After the completion of land reform, agricultural production can be rapidly improved, and at the same time, necessary conditions are created for the development of industry. On the other hand, the people's democratic power in rural areas has a more solid foundation. Therefore, implementing land reform is the basic task of building a new China.
　　3. The signing of the new Sino-Soviet treaty is of great historical significance and plays a decisive role in the construction of the new China. It consolidates the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union, so that China can obtain various assistance from fraternal countries in the big family of the peace and democracy camp, and can let go of its hands to carry out domestic construction work more quickly. The new Sino-Soviet treaty is so beneficial to us, but we must not relax our struggle against imperialism, especially American imperialism, for a minute. Although the contradictions within the American-led imperialist bloc and the contradictions between imperialists themselves are becoming increasingly acute, they will not abandon their conspiracies to provoke and launch wars. American imperialism is actively arming Japan, illegally using the name of the United Nations, carrying out armed aggression against Korea and Taiwan, and instigating the Kuomintang remnant bandits to secretly organize secret agents and bandits to carry out counter-revolutionary activities such as spreading rumors, alienating, slandering, instigating, and undermining the security of the mainland. Recently, the American invading air force in Korea has invaded the Andong area of ​​our Northeast once or twice. These are concrete manifestations of its consistent conspiracy to provoke war. We must recognize the nature of imperialism, which is war itself. However, the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union has become even stronger since the establishment of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic in Europe. The rapid economic construction of various democratic countries and the surging peace signature movement of the people all over the world, if these forces develop, they will be able to stop the war. Therefore, the current international situation is very favorable to us due to the signing of the Sino-Soviet treaty, but we must be vigilant, strengthen the anti-American struggle, expose the conspiracies and tricks of American imperialism at any time, and resolutely fight to the end against war and to defend world lasting peace.
　　The People's Republic of China has achieved such brilliant and great achievements in just one year since its founding, which symbolizes that the construction prospect of the new China has unlimited brightness. However, these achievements are inseparable from the Chinese Communist Party, which has mastered Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, our celebration of the People's Republic of China is to strengthen our will and closely follow the bright banner of the Chinese Communist Party and the people's leader Mao Zedong, and strive and fight to the end for the construction of a new democratic country.

### 庆祝中华人民共和国一年来的伟大成就

　　庆祝中华人民共和国一年来的伟大成就
    中国农工民主党主席  章伯钧
    今天我们来庆祝中华人民共和国成立一周年纪念，这是非常值得欢欣鼓舞的。
    中国人民，一向是处于被压迫被剥削的地位，过去长期在封建势力的支配下过着奴隶的生活，近百年来又加上帝国主义和官僚资本主义的压迫，更是抬不起头来，看不见天日。中国人民，虽曾为了自己的独立自由，作过不断的革命斗争，流过无量的鲜血，但都由于缺乏正确的领导，没有得到解放。自从俄国十月革命成功之后，才给中国人民带来了真正解放的福音。中国无产阶级及其政党中国共产党，便在这时长成起来，广大的中国人民，团结在它的周围，由于它的正确领导坚苦奋斗，不但打垮了强大的日本帝国主义，接着也就打垮了帝国主义，封建主义官僚资本主义总代理人国民党反动派，建立了自己的政府，做了自己国家的主人，中华人民共和国是经过这样长期而非常艰苦的斗争建立起来的。因此，中国人民是特别爱护自己的祖国——中华人民共和国，所以在仅仅一年的建设行程中，便克服了很多很大的困难，做了很多有重大意义而对建设新中国具有决定性的工作，为新民主主义开辟了光明的前途。
    一、中国的财政经济，从来就没有统一过，尤其在国民党反动派政府统治时代，更是混乱不堪，整个社会经济趋于破产，民穷财尽至于极点，人民政府成立之后，在几个月内便实现了全国财政经济上的统一管理和统一领导，因而取得了财政收支的平衡，停止了通货膨胀，稳定了物价，克服了广大地区的灾荒，救济和安置了大批失业人员，一般工商业，尤其是东北，华北各地区，目前已呈现着欣欣向荣的气象，大规模的生产建设工作，正在按照计划作有步骤的进行，这些蓬蓬勃勃的建国新气象，不是可以偶然得来的，而是由于中央人民政府的正确领导和各级干部的坚决执行，实行了公私兼顾，精简节约的政策；另一面由于社会各阶层以及全国人民的热烈拥护，他们自愿自觉的以交粮纳税和购买公债的实际行动来积极支持政府，这说明了今日的政府和人民，已经是完全打成一片了，才会有这样的成绩。
    二、新民主主义阶段中最重要的任务，是实行土改，消灭封建的土地剥削制度，解放广大农村的生产力，发展生产，为社会主义打下基础，这一工作在去年冬季，就在华北各城市的近郊以及河南一半总共约有二千多万农业人口的地区，顺利的完成了，目前华东、中南约有一亿六千万农业人口的地区，正在开始进行土改，这一工作，由于中共的正确领导和社会各阶层、各民主党派以及广大人民的热烈拥护，是一定可以胜利完成的。土改完成后，农业生产，固然可以迅速的提高，同时又为发展工业创造了必要的条件。另一方面，对农村人民民主政权，更有了巩固的基础，所以实行土改，是建设新中国的基本任务。
    三、签订新的中苏条约，这是具有伟大的历史意义的，对于新中国建设，是有其决定性的作用，它巩固了中苏两国的友好关系，使中国在和平民主阵营的大家庭内，得到兄弟国的种种帮助，可以放手的更迅速的进行国内的建设工作。新的中苏条约，对我们是如此有利，但我们一分钟也不能放松对帝国主义特别是美帝国主义的斗争，以美帝为首的帝国主义集团，虽然其本身矛盾，以及帝国主义互相之间的矛盾，日趋尖锐，但他们对于挑拨，发动战争的阴谋是不会放弃。美帝积极武装日本，非法利用联合国名义，实行武装侵略朝鲜、台湾并策动国民党残余匪帮，秘密组织特务土匪进行造谣、离间、中伤、煽动，破坏大陆治安等反革命活动，最近美帝侵朝空军，一次二次的侵袭我东北安东各地区，都是它企图挑拨战争的一贯阴谋的具体表现，我们要认识帝国主义的本质，它本身就是战争，但是以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，自从中华人民共和国和欧洲德意志人民共和国成立以后，是更为壮大了，各民主国家突飞猛进的生产经济建设和全世界人民风起云涌的和平签名运动，这些力量，发展下去，是能够制止战争，因此，目前的国际形势，由于中苏条约的签订，对我们是非常有利的，但我们要提高警惕，加强反美斗争，随时揭破美帝的阴谋诡计，为反对战争，保卫世界持久和平而坚决奋斗到底。
    中华人民共和国成立仅仅一周年，就有如此辉煌伟大的成就，这便象征着新中国的建设前途，是有无限的光明，然而这些成就，一点一滴都和掌握着马列主义和毛泽东思想的中国共产党是分不开的。因此，我们庆祝中华人民共和国是要坚定意志，紧紧跟着中国共产党和人民领袖毛泽东的鲜明旗帜前进，为建设新民主主义国家而努力而奋斗到底。
