The Remaining Poison of the Feudal Marriage System!
Two Letters Reporting the Abuse and Murder of Child Brides

I. Letter from the Women's Federation of Fuzhu Township, Fujian Province

Comrade Editor:

I am writing to inform you of an incident where a mother-in-law forced her daughter-in-law to death. I hope this can be published to attract public attention. The details of the incident are as follows:

Lin Yilian is a member of the Women's Federation of Fuzhu Township, Fourth District, Minhou. She was from Lanpu, Fourth District, and came from a poor family. Her father died when she was three years old, and she was sent to the Xie family in Fuzhu Township as a child bride. Her husband, Xie Yijin, was a man without his own opinions. Her mother-in-law and aunt-in-law were always unreasonable and often abused and beat Lin Yilian, sometimes not even giving her food. Every time she ate, she swallowed her food with tears. Lin Yilian came to the Xie family when she was three years old. For twenty-five years, she was beaten and suffered, living a life where "at home, she was not treated like a human, and outside, she was worse than a ghost." She felt she could not live any longer and hanged herself on the night of September 22nd this year.

On the night she hanged herself, she looked at her nine-month-old daughter with a painful heart. Her mother-in-law and husband scolded her, saying, "Hurry up and die, it will all be over when you die." After she was forced to hang herself, her nine-month-old daughter woke up and cried loudly because she had no milk to eat. Her mother-in-law and husband even said, "It would be a relief if you all died together, it would be cleaner!"

The next day, when the villagers learned about Lin Yilian's suicide by hanging, they all said indignantly, "Such a good daughter-in-law was abused to death by a tyrannical and unreasonable mother-in-law. Lin Yilian was so loyal and honest, and she could endure hardship and work hard, going up the mountain to chop firewood, planting fields, carrying water, and picking up manure every day. Who would have thought she would end up like this!"

The Fuzhu Village Women's Federation demands that the government seek justice for Lin Yilian and give the mother-in-law and husband who abused women and forced Lin Yilian to death the punishment they deserve. When her mother-in-law and husband found out, they went to the chairman of the Women's Federation and said, "Why are you interfering in my family affairs? Lin Yilian was bought with my money, and I can do whatever I want with her. When she was alive, she was a member of my family, and when she is dead, she is a ghost of my family. What does it have to do with your Women's Federation?!" Her mother-in-law and husband even cursed in the streets every day, saying that they should not interfere in their family affairs.

Comrade Editor, we women have suffered thousands of years of feudal oppression. Today, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have been liberated, and we women are no longer the slaves and beasts of burden of feudal families. We demand that the government seek justice for Lin Yilian and give legal sanctions to those who illegally force women to death.

II. Letter from Zhang Jiping and others, Huangchuan County, Henan Province

Comrade Editor:

Yi Xiaomao, female, is from Guangshan County, Henan Province, and is now nineteen years old. Her father died when she was one year old. When she was nine years old, she went to the Ren family in Zhou Dang District, Luoshan County, Henan Province, as a child bride. Her fiancé, Ren Xinzhi, was drafted into the army during the Kuomintang rule and joined the People's Liberation Army last year. Her mother-in-law, Ren Huang, was tyrannical and unreasonable, and often abused and beat Yi Xiaomao.

On the evening of June 13th this year, when Xiaomao was making noodles, her mother-in-law falsely accused her of stealing noodles to make steamed buns and immediately searched her. However, no stolen noodles were found. Her mother-in-law became angry out of shame and grabbed Xiaomao and beat her severely. The next morning, she used a bamboo stick to beat Xiaomao's back to pieces. After breakfast, Xiaomao drank red alum water in an attempt to commit suicide.

At noon, the mother-in-law ordered Xiaomao to fluff cotton. However, the drug was already taking effect, and Xiaomao had a stomach ache and could not hold on, so she did not go to fluff the cotton. Her mother-in-law beat her up again. A neighbor woman, Wan Guojing, learned about this and went to dissuade her. She saw that Xiaomao's complexion was very bad. After questioning her, she learned that Xiaomao had taken poison. Wan Guojing asked Xiaomao's father-in-law to quickly call a doctor for treatment, but Xiaomao's mother-in-law stubbornly prevented him, saying, "The family is poor, and there is no money. If she dies, I will go to prison to pay for her life!" Xiaomao finally died at about twelve o'clock the next morning. After the incident, in order to resolutely protect human rights and thoroughly eliminate the remaining poison of the feudal marriage system, the Luoshan County People's Government submitted a request to the Henan Provincial People's Government for approval to sentence the criminal Ren Huang to fifteen years in prison.

　　封建婚姻制度的遗毒！
    两封报告虐杀童养媳的来信
    一、福建傅筑乡妇联会来信编者同志：
    我告诉你一桩婆婆逼死儿媳的事件，希望发表，以引起舆论的注意。事情的经过如下：
    林依莲是闽侯四区傅筑乡妇联会会员。她是四区兰圃人，出身贫苦，三岁时死了爸爸，就被送到傅筑乡谢家作童养媳。他丈夫谢依金，是个没有主张的人。她婆婆和婶婆，一向蛮不讲理，经常虐待、打骂林依莲，有时还不给她吃饭。每次吃饭时，她总是饭和眼泪一起向肚里咽。林依莲三岁时即到了谢家，二十五年来，一直挨打受气，过着“在家不像人，出门不如鬼”的生活。她觉得实在活不下去了，在今年九月二十二日晚上上吊自杀了。
    在她上吊的那天晚上，她带着痛苦的心情看着她九个月的女孩。她的婆婆和丈夫骂她说：“你赶快死吧，死了才算完了事哩。”她被迫上吊后，九个月的女孩睡醒了，因为没有奶吃，大哭起来。她的婆婆和丈夫还说：“你们一起死了才痛快，才干净哩！”
    第二天，乡里人知道了林依莲上吊自杀的事情，都不平地说：“这样一个好媳妇，被蛮横不讲理的婆婆虐待死了。林依莲可忠厚老实，又能吃苦干活，每天上山砍柴，下田种地、挑水拾粪，没想到会落到这样的结果！”
    傅筑村妇联会要求政府为林依莲伸冤，给虐待妇女、逼死林依莲的婆婆和丈夫以应得的处罚。她的婆婆、丈夫知道了，竟去找妇联主席说：“你们为什么要管我的家事？林依莲是我拿钱买来的，我想怎么样就把她怎么样。他活时是我家的人，死了是我家的鬼，与你妇联会有什么相干？！”她的婆婆和丈夫并且每天在街上大骂，说不该管他家的事。
    编者同志，我们妇女过去受了几千年的封建压迫。今天，中国人民在共产党、毛主席领导下得到了解放，我们妇女再不是过去封建家庭的奴隶和牛马了。我们要求政府替林依莲伸冤，给非法逼死妇女的人们以法律制裁。
        福建省傅筑乡妇联会全体妇女

    二、河南潢川县张季平等来信编辑同志：
    易小毛，女，河南省光山县人，现年十九岁。她一岁时，死了父亲；九岁时，就到河南省罗山县周党区任家做童养媳。她的未婚丈夫任心志，在国民党统治时期被抽壮丁抽去了，去年已参加人民解放军。她的婆母任黄氏，蛮横无理，经常虐待、打骂易小毛。
    今年六月十三日晚，当小毛做面条时，她婆婆诬她偷面做馍，即进行搜查。但结果并未发现小毛偷面。她婆婆恼羞成怒，就扭住小毛毒打。次日晨，又用竹棍把小毛的脊背也打烂了。小毛就在早饭后，喝了红矾水，企图自杀。
    中午，婆婆令小毛弹花。可是这时药力已开始发作，小毛肚疼，难以支持，就没有去弹。她婆婆又把她毒打了一顿。邻居妇女万国菁知道了这事以后，前往劝阻。她见小毛的脸色很不好，经追问后才知道小毛已服了毒。万国菁叫小毛的公公赶快去请医生来治疗，小毛的婆婆竟蛮横地阻止说：“家里穷，没钱。她死了，我去坐班房（监狱）抵命！”小毛终于次日上午十二时左右死了。事件发生后，罗山县人民政府为了坚决保障人权，彻底扫除封建婚姻制度的遗毒，呈请河南省人民政府批准，判处该犯任黄氏徒刑十五年。
