　　Northeast People's Government Trade Department
    First Phase of Rectification Concludes
    Identifying Shortcomings in Trade Work Lagging Behind Industrial and Agricultural Development, and Insufficiently Smooth Commodity Circulation.
    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Northeast Daily, the first phase of the rectification campaign in the Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government has basically concluded, and it has now entered a stage of in-depth implementation, specifically combining rectification with work improvement. On the 26th of last month, the department convened a meeting of cadres at the section chief level and above from the department itself and its affiliated specialized companies. Minister Wang Xingrang delivered a report on the rectification work, first providing a brief summary of the first phase of the department's rectification, and then pointing out how the Trade Department and its specialized companies should, on the basis of the first phase of rectification, further implement and improve their work. Finally, based on the current tasks of commercial work, he put forward specific opinions on implementing the resolutions of the Northeast Bureau's commercial work conference.
    Regarding the brief summary of the first phase of rectification, Minister Wang pointed out: From early July to mid-September, the rectification in the Trade Department was carried out among department, bureau, and section chiefs, as well as company managers. The main gains of this period were: 1. A comprehensive examination and basic summary of the Northeast's trade work was conducted. From the examination and summary, we found that the most important and fundamental problem in our work is that trade work still lags behind the needs of industrial and agricultural production and economic development. Specifically, this is manifested in insufficiently smooth commodity circulation. From this, we realized that only by expanding and accelerating commodity circulation can we cooperate with the development of industry and agriculture, and only then can we meet the production and living needs of the people. 2. Through rectification, we clarified a number of basic policies, especially after the Northeast Bureau's commercial work conference, we clarified that giving play to the leading role of state-owned commerce is the fundamental way to accelerate commodity circulation. In the past, we only paid attention to the role of state-owned commerce itself, and did not do enough to lead all aspects of the economy to play its due role. 3. We discovered that the fundamental problem in managing state-owned commerce lies in the lack of an economic accounting system. Only by implementing an economic accounting system can we give full play to the economic strength of state-owned commerce and make it a tool for implementing policies; otherwise, the state will suffer losses, policies cannot be implemented, and obstacles will occur in our work. 4. The preliminary rectification pointed out the shortcomings in the Trade Department's overall leadership style, making it possible to unite the broad masses of commercial cadres to improve their work.
    Regarding the second phase of the rectification, Minister Wang pointed out: The current task is to deepen the rectification and improve the work. This means that the guidelines and policies that have been clarified by the leadership in the first phase should be specifically combined with the work of each bureau, section, and company and implemented in actual work, so that all cadres understand the thinking that has been clarified by the leadership and master its application to improving work. Therefore, this phase of rectification is even more important. Minister Wang pointed out that in order to do a good job in the second phase of rectification, the following three tasks must be done well:
    1. Be good at identifying key issues: Key issues are the root cause of many shortcomings and deviations in our work, and in a sense, they are issues of an essential nature. Key issues lie in the leadership of bureaus, sections, and companies, not in the sections, as the sections are only a component part of the bureaus, sections, and companies. Once the overall problems are solved, the work problems in the sections will be easily clarified. Each unit should pay close attention to identifying the key issues in its own unit during the rectification, so as to avoid generalizing the rectification and combining it with work improvement.
    2. Promote democracy and encourage everyone to come up with ideas: The leadership should use democratic methods to inspire cadres to use their brains and think about problems. At the same time, we must believe in the wisdom of the masses and let everyone study the problems. General cadres should also overcome the idea of "fear of making mistakes" and relying on the leadership, and develop a spirit of courage to take responsibility in order to study and discuss problems.
    3. Launch in-depth criticism and self-criticism, and pay attention to starting from the analysis of concrete facts, not from general concepts. We must not only find the root causes of shortcomings and problems, but also propose ways to improve shortcomings and solve problems, so that the rectification can achieve practical results.
    Finally, Minister Wang put forward specific opinions on how to implement the resolutions of the commercial work conference. The first is to mobilize all cadres to open their minds, criticize the shortcomings existing in the trade work in the past, and propose ways to improve the work in accordance with the resolutions of the conference. Whether the work in the fourth quarter is good or bad depends on the extent to which we implement the resolutions of the conference. In the future, in order to implement the general policy of expanding and accelerating commodity circulation, we must grasp three major issues: namely, selling grain and transporting grain; buying good imported goods and selling good imported goods; and doing a good job in the transportation and sales of native products. These three tasks have the greatest impact on the flow of materials between urban and rural areas and between inside and outside the Northeast. Taking grain as an example, starting from the fourth quarter, state-owned grain companies will have to transport 10,000 tons of grain every day in order to ensure that urban-rural exchanges do not stagnate. If such a huge task cannot be completed, it will affect the entire commodity circulation. The reason why the transportation and sales of native products is important is that the output of native products has increased compared to last year, and the state's business plan has been reduced. A large amount of native products must be organized by various economic forces under the leadership of the state-owned economy to participate in the operation. Doing this work well will benefit farmers' sideline production, private commerce, cooperatives, and the state.

　　东北人民政府贸易部
    第一阶段整风结束
    检查出贸易工作落后于工农业发展需要，商品流转不够畅通的毛病。
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：东北人民政府贸易部整风第一阶段已基本结束，现已进入具体结合改进工作的深入贯彻阶段。该部于上月二十六日召开本部及所属各专业公司科长以上干部会议，由王兴让部长作关于整风工作报告，首先对该部第一阶段的整风作了简要总结，进而指出贸易部及各专业公司今后如何在第一阶段整风的基础上，深入贯彻，改进工作。最后他根据商业工作的当前任务，提出了贯彻东北局商业工作会议决议的具体意见。
    关于第一阶段整风简要总结，王部长指出：自七月初到九月中旬，贸易部的整风是在部、局、处长及公司经理间进行的，这一时期的主要收获是：一、在总的方面把东北的贸易工作做了一次全面检查与基本总结。从检查与总结中，使我们找到了工作中最主要与最基本的问题是贸易工作尚落后于工农业生产与经济发展的需要，具体表现就是商品流转不够通畅。从此认识到只有扩大与加速商品流转，才能配合工农业的发展，才能满足人民生产、生活的需要。二、通过整风使我们明确了若干基本政策，特别是东北局商业工作会议后，明确了发挥国营商业的领导作用是加速商品流转的根本办法。过去我们只注意了国营商业本身的作用，而对于领导各方面经济发挥其应有作用一点做的不够。三、我们发现了管理国营商业的根本毛病在于缺乏经济核算制。只有贯彻了经济核算制，才能发挥国营商业的经济力量，并使之成为贯彻政策的工具，否则就会使国家受损失，政策不能推行，工作发生障碍。四、初步整风指出了贸易部总的领导作风上的毛病，使团结广大商业干部改进工作成为可能。
    关于第二阶段的整风，王部长指出：当前的任务是深入整风改进工作。就是把第一阶段领导上已经明确了的方针、政策，具体地结合着各局、处、公司的本身工作，贯彻到实际工作中去。使全体干部懂得领导上已明确了的思想，并掌握运用于改进工作。因此，这一阶段的整风是更加重要了。王部长指出：为了把第二阶段整风搞好，要做好以下三项工作：
    一、善于找出关键问题：关键问题是我们工作中许多缺点、偏差的总根源，在一定意义上说是带着本质性的问题。关键问题是在局、处、公司领导上，而不是在科里，科只是局、处、公司的组成部分，全盘的问题得到解决，科里的工作问题就易研究清楚。各单位整风中应很好的注意找出本单位的关键问题所在，才能使整风避免一般化，并与改进工作结合起来。
    二、发扬民主，使大家想办法：领导上要用民主的方式启发干部开动脑筋，思考问题。同时相信群众智慧，让大家去研究问题。一般干部也要克服“怕错”及依靠领导的思想，发扬勇于负责的精神来研讨问题。
    三、展开深入的批评与自我批评，并注意要从具体事实的分析开始，不要从一般概念出发。不但找出缺点、毛病的根源，并且要从中提出改进缺点，解决问题的办法来，只有这样才能使整风收实效。
    最后，王部长提出关于如何贯彻商业工作会议决议的具体意见。首先是动员全体干部打开脑筋，批判过去贸易工作中存在的缺点，并按照会议决议来提出改进工作的办法，第四季度工作好坏就取决于我们贯彻会议决议的程度。今后为了贯彻扩大与加速商品流通的总方针，要抓住三大问题，即是卖粮、运粮；买好进口物资，卖好进口物资；做好土产运销。这三项工作对东北城乡内外物资流通影响最大。以粮食为例，自第四季度起，国营粮食公司将要每天运出一万吨粮食，才能保证城乡交流不致停滞。这样巨大的任务若不能完成，就会影响整个的商品流转。土产运销之所以重要，是由于土产比去年增加了，国家经营计划缩小了，大量的土产要在国营经济的领导下组织各方面经济力量来参加经营。这一工作搞好，对农民副业生产，对私营商业、合作社及国家都有好处。
