Xinhua News Agency, London, October 8th (TASS): The so-called British Commonwealth Ministerial Meeting, convened to discuss economic "aid" to Southeast and South Asia, concluded here on the 4th. Delegations from Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, and Ceylon attended the meeting.

As is well known, two similar meetings were held earlier this year in Colombo, Ceylon, and Sydney, Australia, in January and May. The British government arranged these meetings to achieve its very clear goal: to bring Asian countries in to participate in the military aggression plans of Anglo-American imperialism. To conceal the true purpose of this maneuvering behind the backs of the Asian people, various "plans" and "schemes" were put forward to provide "economic" assistance to backward regions in Southeast Asia.

On the other hand, the Commonwealth meeting reflects the irreconcilable contradictions between Britain and the United States in Asia. British imperialism is trying its best to maintain the British Empire, which is now unable to compete with American monopoly capitalists. However, whatever plans the aforementioned "Commonwealth" makes, they cannot be implemented without American assistance. This point was already acknowledged at the Sydney conference.

The London meeting discussed the draft report prepared by experts on the plan for economic "aid" to South and Southeast Asian countries, which requires approximately 2 billion pounds. These plans include various schemes to "aid" India, Pakistan, and Ceylon, as well as Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, and North Borneo.

The official communiqué issued after the meeting stated that the draft report had been unanimously adopted by the representatives and that the governments of the British Empire would study it. The communiqué emphasized that in order to fully implement this plan, it is necessary to obtain financial support from "international organizations" and countries outside the region.

In this regard, the Daily Telegraph and Morning Post stated more explicitly that it is necessary to contact the US government to raise most of the remaining funds that the British Empire member states cannot provide.

The infamous Spender Plan, proposed by the Australian Foreign Minister at the Sydney conference, was an indirect response from the United States to the call for these funds. The United States made it clear through Spender that if Americans could supervise the implementation of all British "schemes" and these "schemes" were formulated in accordance with American plans in Asia, the United States would agree to "help" Britain.

Therefore, the plan discussed at the London meeting is merely a preparation for formulating an Asian "Marshall Plan," in which Britain will have to willingly play a subordinate role. According to this new plan, Asian governments will first accept "aid" in the form of American military equipment to counter the national liberation movements of the Asian people.

### 企图进一步奴役东南亚人民  英召开大英联邦部长会议  为亚洲“马歇尔计划”做了准备

　　企图进一步奴役东南亚人民
    英召开大英联邦部长会议
    为亚洲“马歇尔计划”做了准备
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社伦敦八日讯：为了讨论经济“援助”东南亚与南亚问题而召开的所谓大英联邦部长会议，已于四日在此间闭幕。出席会议的有英国、加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰、印度、巴基斯坦和锡兰等国的代表团。
    如众周知，在今年年初和五月间，曾经在锡兰的科伦坡和澳大利亚的悉尼举行过两次与此相类似的会议。英国政府所以安排这些会议，是为了实现它的十分明确的目的：要把亚洲国家拉进来，参加实行美英帝国主义的军事侵略计划。为了掩盖背着亚洲人民所进行的这种策动的真正目的，于是提出了各种各样的在东南亚实行“经济”援助落后地区的“计划”和“方案”。
    另一方面，联邦会议反映着英美在亚洲的无可调和的矛盾。英国帝国主义正试图尽力保持现在已无能与美国垄断资本家进行竞争的大英帝国。但是，上面所说的“联邦”不论制定什么计划，如果没有美国的援助，都是不能付诸实行的。这点早在悉尼会议时就已经被承认了。
    伦敦会议讨论了专家所提出的关于经济“援助”南亚与东南亚国家计划的报告草案，这些计划所需费用约二十亿金镑。这些计划包括“援助”印度、巴基斯坦和锡兰以及马来亚、新加坡、萨拉瓦克和北婆罗的各种方案。
    会后发表的官方公报称：报告草案已经与会代表一致通过，大英帝国的各国政府即将予以研究。公报强调指出：为了将这一计划全部付诸实行，必须取得“国际组织”和这一地区以外各国的财政支持。
    每日电讯与晨邮报在这一方面以更为明确的措辞宣称：必须与美国政府接洽，筹措大英帝国各成员国所不能供给的其余款项的大部。
    在悉尼会议中提出的臭名昭彰的澳外长斯宾德计划，就是美国对于要求这些经费的呼吁的间接答复。美国通过斯宾德明白表示：如果美国人可以监督所有英国“方案”的实行，而且这些“方案”制定得和美国在亚洲的计划吻合一致，美国就同意“帮助”英国。
    因此，伦敦会议中所讨论的计划，不过是制定一种亚洲“马歇尔计划”的准备；而英国在此计划中将不得不甘愿担任从仆的角色。根据这个新计划，亚洲国家的政府将首先接受美国军备的“援助”，以对抗亚洲人民的民族解放运动。
