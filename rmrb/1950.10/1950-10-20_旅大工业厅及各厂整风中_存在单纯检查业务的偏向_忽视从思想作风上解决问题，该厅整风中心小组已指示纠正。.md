　　Lüda Industrial Department and Factories' Rectification Campaign
    Shows a Tendency to Simply Inspect Operations
    Neglecting to Solve Problems from an Ideological and Work Style Perspective. The Rectification Central Group of the Department has Instructed to Correct this.
    [Our Dispatch] According to a report from the Lüda People's Daily: In the in-depth development of the rectification movement in the Lüda Industrial Department and its affiliated factories, a tendency has emerged to simply inspect operations, neglecting the inspection of ideological work style. Through inspection, various units have discovered the main problems existing in their work and researched and decided on ways to improve. Some units, starting with in-depth work in workshops, have achieved preliminary results. Other units, in terms of leadership methods, have further understood the work method of using typical examples to promote general work, such as summarizing the leadership method of the Wang Zhaoda group, the weaving method of Qu Yanzeng and Dong Mingxing, and the cotton combing workshop method of Zhang Zhenzu, etc., which are being promoted or prepared for promotion, and are gradually showing improvement in their work. However, most units are simply engaged in operations, and do not pay enough attention to the ideological work style that hinders work improvement, or even do not intend to solve problems from an ideological work style perspective. The focus of the rectification is also not starting from the leadership first, but rather setting aside leading cadres to rectify those below. The methods of criticism and self-criticism have not been correctly applied; the atmosphere of democracy has not been sufficiently promoted. Due to these biases, the current rectification movement cannot be carried out in big strides. After checking out the above biases, the Lüda Industrial Department Rectification Central Group issued a circular, calling on all units to quickly correct them.
    The circular pointed out that the reason why this more serious bias occurred is basically that the leadership has not clearly understood and grasped the rectification spirit of the higher-level instructions. The purpose of rectification instructed by higher authorities is "to educate cadres and improve their ideological and policy level in order to improve their work." The preliminary experience in rectification has also proved that it is precisely because cadres' ideological and policy level is not high that there are many problems in their work that cannot be improved. For example, the low quality of products is the primary problem that generally exists in industrial production. This is due to the existence of a purely profit-oriented view in the leadership's ideology, not considering long-term interests, as well as conservative thinking, thinking that their old experience is good, emphasizing objective reasons, being satisfied with their existing achievements, and absolutely opposing the views of quality and cost issues. Higher product costs are due to the general lack of cost concepts in cost management, only focusing on completing production quantity tasks, the accounting department's calculation of costs is for reporting to higher authorities, as if it has nothing to do with themselves, costs are separated from production, planned costs are loosely estimated and narrowly used, and the idea of a supply system in the entire operation and management, etc. All of these are obstacles to solving problems and improving work. If these problems are not solved ideologically first, they cannot be solved simply from an operational point of view. Therefore, it should be clearly recognized that it is wrong to separate rectification from the current main work, but it is also wrong to simply think that rectification is just doing business.
    Work cannot be improved, on the one hand, due to ideological obstacles, and on the other hand, due to obstacles in work style. Our democratic work style is still very insufficient, and the leadership method still has serious old habits, being busy with coping with daily affairs, solving problems piecemeal, being limited to the office, not being able to go deep into the workshop, and not being good at using organizational structures and systems to understand and deal with problems. Some units have already changed in practice, but this is still intuitive in ideological understanding, and it is not a profound solution to problems from an ideological and comprehensive leadership style. To solve these problems, the method should be in accordance with the "mass inspection work movement combining top-down and bottom-up party members and non-party members, using criticism and self-criticism" pointed out by the Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau. Therefore, it is impossible to carry out rectification by limiting it to a few people and not using the method of criticism and self-criticism. In the steps of rectification, leading cadres should be the first and main priority. Because only when the leadership solves the problems first and improves the ideological and political level can they lead the subordinates to improve their understanding and improve their work. The success or failure of this rectification of leading cadres is the key to improving work in the future.
    The circular calls on: everyone must immediately correct the bias of simply engaging in business, correctly grasp the spirit of closely combining rectification with various work tasks, promote criticism and self-criticism, overcome and correct the current ideology and work style that hinders work, in order to achieve the purpose of improving ideological and political level and improving work.

　　旅大工业厅及各厂整风中
    存在单纯检查业务的偏向
    忽视从思想作风上解决问题，该厅整风中心小组已指示纠正。
    【本报讯】据旅大人民日报消息：旅大工业厅及所属各厂整风运动在深入开展中，发生单纯检查业务，忽视检查思想作风的偏向。各单位通过检查，发现工作中存在的主要问题，研究和决定改进的办法。有些单位从深入车间着手，已获得了初步成绩。还有些单位在领导方法上，进一步体会了典型推动一般的工作方法，如总结王兆达小组的领导方法，曲言增、董明兴织布工作法，张贞祖班梳棉间工作法等，正在推广或准备推广，在工作上逐渐呈现起色。但多数单位单纯搞业务，而对阻碍工作改进的思想作风方面重视不够，甚至不准备从思想作风上去解决问题。整风的重点上也不是首先从领导上着手，而是抛开领导干部整下面。批评和自我批评的方法，还没有正确的运用；民主的风气还发扬得不够。由于这些偏向，使目前整风运动不能大踏步的展开。旅大工业厅整风中心小组在检查出以上偏向后，特发出通报，号召各单位迅速加以纠正。
    该通报指出，这种较为严重的偏向之所以发生，基本上是领导上没有弄清和掌握上级指示的整风精神。上级指示整风的目的“在于教育干部，提高其思想政策水平，以求改进工作”。整风中的初步经验亦已经证明，正由于干部思想政策水平不高，所以工作上存在许多问题，不能改进。譬如产品质量低，这是目前工业生产普遍存在的首要问题，这是由于领导思想上存在着单纯利润观点，不从长远利益着眼，以及保守思想，认为自己的老经验好，强调客观原因，满足于自己的已有成绩，把质量与成本问题绝对地对立的看法等等。产品成本较高，这是由于在成本管理上一般地都缺乏成本观念，只重视完成生产数量任务，会计科的计算成本是为了对上级报告，好像与自己并无多大关系，成本与生产脱离，计划成本宽打窄用，以及整个经营管理中的供给制的思想等等。诸如这些都是解决问题改进工作的障碍，如果不首先从思想上解决这些问题，单纯地从业务上是不能解决问题的。所以应该明确的认识脱离开当前的主要工作去整风是不对的，但把整风单纯地认为就是搞业务也是不对的。
    工作不能得到改进，一方面是由于思想上的障碍，另一方面亦是由于作风上的障碍。我们工作中的民主作风还很不够，领导方法还严重地存在老一套，忙于日常事务的应付，零星解决问题，局限于办公室，不能深入到车间，还不善于运用组织机构和制度了解问题处理问题等缺点。现在有些单位已经在实际中有转变，但是这在思想认识上还是直觉的，还不是深刻地从思想上和全面的领导作风上解决问题。要解决这些问题，在方法上要依照中央及东北局指出的“以批评与自我批评的方法，开展自上而下与自下而上的党内与党外相结合的群众性的检查工作运动”。所以局限于几个人，不用批评与自我批评的方法整风是开展不起来的。在整风的步骤上，要以领导干部为先为主。因为只有领导上首先解决了问题，思想政策水平提高了，才能领导下面去提高认识，改进工作。这次领导干部整风好坏就是今后改进工作的关键。
    通报号召：大家必须立即将单纯搞业务这一偏向纠正过来，正确的掌握整风与各项工作任务密切地相结合的精神，发扬批评与自我批评，克服与纠正目前障碍工作的思想和作风，以达到提高思想水平和政治水平改进工作的目的。
