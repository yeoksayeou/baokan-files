Xinhua News Agency, New York: According to TASS, the UN Economic and Social Council discussed the proposal put forward by Australia on the general principles of organizing aid to Korea at meetings on October 20th and 21st.

　　Soviet representative Arutiunian put forward three suggestions on the general principles of aid to Korea: (1) Ensure that aid to Korea is in line with the interests of the Korean people, accelerates the economic recovery of Korea, and strengthens Korea's economic and political independence. This assistance should not become a means for foreign countries to interfere in Korea's internal affairs economically and politically, and should never be attached with any political conditions. (2) Korean representatives should participate in organizing aid to Korea. (3) The distribution of supplies to aid Korea should first be undertaken by the Red Cross, national institutions, cooperatives, and people's organizations; if private enterprises are entrusted with this work, their profits should be reduced to the minimum.

　　Representatives of the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, and other countries, in order to cover up the despicable conspiracy of expanding American aggression against Korea under the guise of aiding Korea, dared not publicly oppose the Soviet proposal. The first and third suggestions of the Soviet Union were adopted by the Economic and Social Council after minor revisions. Under the manipulation of the US-British bloc countries, the second Soviet suggestion was postponed for discussion at the next meeting.

　　联合国经社理事会讨论“援助朝鲜”提案
    苏代表提出维护朝鲜人民利益的建议
    美帝集团为掩饰其阴谋，对这建议不敢公开反对。
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国经社理事会十月二十、二十一两日会议讨论澳大利亚对于组织援助朝鲜的一般原则所提出的提案。
    苏联代表亚鲁疆对援助朝鲜的一般原则提出三点建议：（一）务使对朝鲜的援助能符合朝鲜人民的利益，加速朝鲜的经济复兴，以加强朝鲜的经济和政治的独立。这种援助不应该成为外国在经济和政治方面干涉朝鲜内政的手段，也决不应该附有任何政治性的规定。（二）在组织援助朝鲜工作中，应有朝鲜代表参加。（三）分配援助朝鲜的供应品的工作首先应由红十字会、国家机构、合作社及人民团体担任，如交由私营企业办理，应使其所获利润减少至最低限度。
    美国、英国、加拿大、澳大利亚、及其他若干国家代表为了掩饰其援助朝鲜乃是为了扩大美国对朝鲜的侵略的卑污阴谋，不敢公开反对苏联的建议。苏联的第一、三两项建议经不重要的修改后为经社理事会所通过。在美英集团国家代表玩弄手法下，苏联第二项建议展延至下次会议中讨论。
