　　Public Jinan Chemical Factory Director
    Determined to Improve Leadership Style
    To the Editor:
    We believe that the criticism of the Jinan Chemical Factory published in the People's Garden on October 7th by a reader is valuable. Currently, we are combining this with rectification and self-examination. We are determined to overcome arrogance and complacency and correct bureaucratic work styles in this rectification to improve our work.
    Although Director Wang and I have divided our responsibilities, my personal tendency to take on everything myself, instead of utilizing the organization to promote work, has prevented many cadres from maximizing their initiative.
    The Party branch has not done enough to educate Party members. Due to the lack of criticism and self-criticism within the Party, individual Party member cadres have developed a sense of self-importance and become detached from the masses, creating a gap between the Party and the masses and affecting the Party's political credibility among the masses. We plan to conduct a thorough reckoning of Party members' meritorious-official mentality during the rectification to improve Party-masses relations.
    Regarding the compensation issues of Tang Tongyi and Li Mingfa, we believe that investigating work responsibilities to avoid losses is necessary. The management committee had discussed and decided that those who failed to fulfill their work responsibilities, resulting in financial losses, should compensate one-third (up to 100,000 yuan, minimum 3,600 yuan RMB). However, because our report to the production department was not detailed enough and did not explain the matter clearly, the higher authorities ordered full compensation. However, the general workers felt that the compensation was too heavy and could not understand it, so they were afraid to work boldly, fearing they would have to pay if they made mistakes. After discovering this situation, we did not promptly study and resolve the problem, and it was delayed for more than two months before the management committee re-examined it and submitted it to the higher authorities for approval, handling it according to the original decision. Comrade Tang Tongyi, after studying and improving his understanding, voluntarily confessed that he had embezzled 100 jin of raw oil last spring, and also stole and sold three milling cutter blades with Jia Xiangfeng, obtaining 100,000 ocean dollars (Beihai currency), each getting 50,000. Because Comrade Tang voluntarily confessed, the leadership, in addition to recovering the materials, did not impose any punishment. As for the main reason for Comrade Tang's passive work, it was caused by the compensation issue.
    Regarding the resignations of Comrades Ding Zengming, Zhang Yunpeng, and Dai Fangzhi, Comrade Ding requested to leave for recuperation due to a leg ailment and is partnering with others in business, which has been approved by higher authorities. Comrade Zhang Yunpeng was assigned to the engineering section last year to do statistics work, but he felt that it was not as promising as being a cost accountant and also felt that the salary was low (66 points), so he was not very at ease in his work. After a year of study, he is now more at ease. Comrade Dai Fangzhi was mobilized to go south to Qingdao before the liberation, and he agreed to go, but the transfer did not happen, so his thinking fluctuated. After explanations from the leadership, he is now working with peace of mind.
    Regarding the wage issue, we organized a wage evaluation committee last May and conducted an evaluation. In November, we adjusted the wages of more than ten apprentices (apprentices were originally scheduled to be adjusted every six months). Now, the apprentices' technical level has improved considerably, and some can master part of the business, and they should be given a wage adjustment, but we failed to take the initiative to give them an adjustment. This is wrong. Now, the management committee has decided to prepare to adjust their wages.
    The above problems are mainly caused by our unclear understanding of relying on workers and uniting with technical personnel and staff. In order to run the enterprise well, after the rectification, we are determined to correct this erroneous leadership style and establish various necessary systems to improve the work of the chemical factory.

### 公营济南化工厂厂长  决心改进领导作风

　　公营济南化工厂厂长
    决心改进领导作风
    编辑同志：
    十月七日人民园地发表了一读者对济南化工厂的批评，我们认为这种批评是宝贵的。现在，我们正在结合整风检查工作。我们有决心在整风中克服骄傲自满情绪，纠正官僚主义作风，以改进工作。
    我与王厂长虽然分了工，但由于我个人的包办代替，不去运用组织推动工作，使得许多干部不能发挥积极性。
    党支部对党员的教育做得不够。由于党内未开展批评和自我批评，个别党员干部产生了居功自傲、脱离群众的现象，造成党群之间的隔阂，影响了党在群众中的政治信誉。我们准备在整风中，对党员的功臣思想作一次清算，以改善党群关系。
    关于唐同义及李铭法等的赔偿问题：我们认为追究工作责任，以避免损失是必要的。管委会曾讨论决定，凡因工作未能尽责，造成资财损失者赔偿三分之一（最多者十万，少者三千六百元人民币）。但因我们写给生产部的报告不太详细，没有把事情交待清楚，所以上级着令全部赔偿。可是一般工人同志都感到赔偿过重，想不通，因而不敢大胆工作，怕出了错误赔钱。我们发现这种情况后，没有及时研究解决办法，一直拖了两个多月才由管委会重新研究，呈请上级批准，按原决定作了处理。唐同义同志经过学习，认识提高，自动坦白了去年春天曾贪污生油一百斤，另和贾象风盗卖铣刀片三个得洋十万元（北海币），各得五万元。因唐同志自动坦白，领导上除追回物资外，不加任何处分。至于唐同志工作消极的主要原因，是因赔偿问题引起的。
    关于丁增明、张云鹏、戴方智等三同志辞职问题：丁同志因腿病要求离职休养，并与别人合伙经营商业，已经上级批准离职。张云鹏同志于去年分配到工务股作统计工作，自己认为不如作成本会计前途大，另外感到工资低（六十六分），因此工作不大安心。经过一年的学习现在都比较安心了。戴方智同志在青岛解放前曾被动员东下，他也同意去，但结果没有调动，因此，他的思想起了波动。经过领导同志解释后，他现已安心工作了。
    工资问题：去年五月份我们组织了评资委员会，并作了一次评议。十一月份又给十余学徒的工资调整了一次（学徒原定每半年调整一次）。现在学徒们的技术水平已相当提高，有的能掌握部分业务，应该给予调整工资才对，而我们未能主动给予调整。这是不对的。现在，管委会已经决定准备调整他们的工资。
    以上问题，主要由于我们对依靠工人，团结技术人员及职员的认识不明确所造成的。为了搞好企业，我们在整风之后，决心纠正这种错误的领导作风，建立各种必要的制度，以改进化工厂的工作。
