How to Overcome Coercive Commandism in Rectification Campaigns in East China?
Li Qing, Yang Gang, Lin Wei

One of the most important gains of the rectification campaign in East China is the deep exposure of coercive commandism, which was quite widespread. Before the rectification, this style of work existed not only among ordinary district and township cadres but also among a few leading cadres at the county level and above. It was not merely about issuing orders without consulting the masses or acting without regard for their experience and level of awareness. It had evolved into hitting, scolding, detaining, and fining the masses, infringing on their human rights. The thorough criticism and overcoming of this bad style is one of the important conditions for the smooth launching and completion of land reform and leading farmers in production and construction.

Exposing Coercive Commandism Among Cadres

This style of work occurred most commonly and severely in the collection of grain taxes. During the autumn grain levy last year in the Jinhua Special District of Zhejiang, a method of guaranteeing and signing off at each level from top to bottom was adopted to ensure the completion of the task. Some villages even required each household to provide a guarantee and sign, and peasants who did not provide a guarantee were not allowed to go home. In Dongyang County, the specific implementation involved four methods: deduction, coercion, training, and attack (struggle). Some villages held meetings all night, not adjourning until the grain was handed over. In Fu'an County, Fujian, there were 800 incidents of 98 cadres hitting and scolding the masses during grain collection. Similar situations were not uncommon in northern Anhui and southern Jiangsu. Coercive commandism was also serious in leading production, disaster relief, and other work. In Cixi, Zhejiang, and Wu County, southern Jiangsu, some villages forced farmers to catch a certain number of insects (to eliminate pests), and paraded farmers who were superstitious and unwilling to catch insects through the streets. In order to complete the numbers (failure to do so would result in punishment), the masses caught butterflies to make up the count. In Dongliu County, southern Anhui, a headquarters chief detained an average of two to three people every day during the six months of repairing the embankment. There were also secret confinement rooms on the embankment. According to statistics from the Anhui South Party School, cadres who had made mistakes such as hitting and scolding the masses accounted for 70% of the trainees; in the Changxing rectification class in Zhejiang, it was about 80%; and in the Southern Jiangsu Party School, it was about 50%. The prevalence of coercive commandism can be seen from this.

These comrades unanimously emphasized, "Coercive commandism is bad, but it can complete the task; persuasion and mobilization are good, but they can't complete the task." They did "complete" many tasks; but after these tasks were "completed," the level of awareness of the masses not only did not increase, but they also resented the Party and the People's Government, creating many opportunities for counter-revolutionaries. As a result, a peasant riot incited by counter-revolutionaries occurred in the Jiaxing Special District of Zhejiang. However, many cadres still did not know the seriousness of the matter and continued to use the methods of the Kuomintang reactionaries to suppress the resistance of the masses.

Even from the perspective of so-called "completing the task," the result of adopting coercive commandism was often that things became more and more rigid, and ultimately could not be completed. In the promotion of cotton planting, many cadres adopted the method of forced planting, without providing specific guidance to the masses who had never planted cotton. As a result, many people planted empty mounds or sowed cooked seeds. In the clearing of outstanding public grain, some villages forced the masses to write "grain delivery letters," but in the end, they still could not deliver the grain. If this coercive commandism is not corrected, the masses will come up with more ways to cope with it.

In order to correct this bad style, the rectification classes (including Party schools) in various places, in addition to criticizing the serious facts revealed and using the serious consequences to alert the general cadres, further analyzed the different situations and reasons for making mistakes.

Reasons for the emergence of coercive commandism:

According to statistics from various places, the composition of the general district and township cadres is good, mostly poor laborers (those with bad composition are a minority). They are generally very enthusiastic about revolutionary work and subjectively want to do a good job. However, they lack experience and do not understand the mass line. And the tasks of the past year have been numerous and intense, which has provided an objective basis for coercive commandism.

These cadres have not yet established a correct mass viewpoint. Some even believe that the masses are "born with a slave nature" and that coercion is necessary. Among some cadres from the old areas, there is an absurd argument: "The masses in the new areas have been educated by the Kuomintang reactionary rule for a long time, and there are few good ones and many bad ones. Persuasion and mobilization are not applicable to them." These comrades do not understand the long-term disasters inflicted on the people of the new areas by the Kuomintang reactionaries and feudal rulers. They do not believe that as long as we can base our work on the political experience of the masses and improve their level of awareness, we can definitely turn the Party's tasks into the masses' own tasks, and the masses will definitely take action to liberate themselves. In their work, they only know how to be responsible to the superiors, not to the people. They cannot combine being responsible to the superiors with being responsible to the people. When accepting tasks, they do not consider whether these tasks have the conditions and possibility to be completed; they just blindly accept them and guarantee completion. They cannot provide the superiors with correct information and investigation materials to help the superiors make the tasks more correct.

Looking at the leadership at the county level and above, they generally rarely provide the lower-level cadres with vivid examples, using good practices as typical demonstrations. Some even encourage coercive commandism. When the county head of Qimen County in southern Anhui arranged the task of grain collection, he said to the cadres excitedly: "I have already guaranteed to the commissioner's office that if the task is not completed, I will take my head to see them; you are the same, if the task is not completed, bring your heads to see me." The county head of Jingde County required the cadres to complete the task of grain collection in four days. When the cadres asked for instructions, he replied: "Apart from killing people, any method can be used." The Zhuji County Party Committee of Zhejiang once praised the cadres who completed the task by hitting and scolding people. In the Chizhou Special District of southern Anhui, there were incidents of the county Party committee and the county head personally hitting people. Some special commissioners reflected during the rectification: they were not unaware of the phenomenon of indiscriminate beating and detention below, but they were afraid of not completing the task and dared not stop it. The aforementioned method of guaranteeing grain delivery at each level in the Jinhua Special District of Zhejiang was started by the special commissioner's office. When assigning tasks, these leading organs generally lack serious and meticulous investigation and research into the situation below; some do not pay attention even if the lower levels reflect the true situation, and do not make possible and necessary adjustments; some increase the tasks without authorization, such as the eleven counties in the Jinhua Special District that arbitrarily increased public grain by 26 million catties last autumn. The time for the lower levels to carry out the tasks is often squeezed out by half by the superiors' procrastination meetings, making it very short; coupled with the fact that some leading cadres themselves are reckless, it is not surprising that coercive commandism is widespread below.

Conducting mass line education to overcome coercive commandism

In order to overcome coercive commandism in work, the rectification classes in various places have conducted education on the Party's mass line among cadres, and universally established the basic mass viewpoints of serving the people, being responsible to the people, the people liberating themselves, and learning from the people. Secondly, the leading organs and leading cadres should take the lead in making self-criticism, clarifying responsibilities level by level, and determining future directions and practices. Thirdly, the most effective way is to show everyone vivid facts and compare typical examples of good and bad work styles. In the rectification of the Southern Jiangsu District Party School, the typical reports of dike repairs in Shaxi District, Taicang County, and Baizhang District, Wujin County, gave everyone a great inspiration. Shaxi District patiently persuaded the masses beforehand, dispelling their concerns; consulted with the masses everywhere during the process, smoothly solved various difficulties such as housing, and promptly commended good migrant workers, inspiring a high degree of labor enthusiasm, and the dike was repaired quickly and solidly. Baizhang District did not mobilize or explain, but forced labor. Coupled with rumors and instigation by bad elements, it resulted in a riot of 400 to 500 people, and the dike repair was also delayed. This comparison made many cadres see clearly the methods they should choose. Other regions have also used this method. As a result, most cadres began to have confidence in completing tasks by following the mass line.

There are two other erroneous ideological styles

In addition, the rectification also exposed and criticized two erroneous ideological styles. One is that many comrades in the suppression of bandits and special agents, the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities of unlawful landlords, the suppression of smuggling, and other work to maintain law and order, have adopted the method of indiscriminate arrests, beatings, and forced confessions against criminals and suspects. They regard these as the most effective or even the only effective way to deal with counter-revolutionaries and other illegal activities, believing that this is "supporting the masses" and that "it is okay not to hit or scold the masses, but it is not okay not to hit or scold these people." In the Fuyang Special District of northern Anhui, eight of the ten county public security bureau chiefs had personally beaten people. Naturally, everyone below learned from them. Some cadres in the Public Security Department of the Yancheng Special District of northern Jiangsu saw that the lower levels were indiscriminately deducting, fining, and beating people in the handling of puppet personnel and household registration, but did not correct them. The reason is "Although we do not advocate this practice, we cannot pour cold water on it." For these comrades, it is mainly to strengthen policy education so that they understand that doing so can only create chaos and cannot truly solve the problem. And it will create many excuses for counter-revolutionary activities. It is necessary to handle them correctly in accordance with legal procedures and mobilize and organize the masses to actively assist in order to be effective. Those who were "infinitely lenient" to counter-revolutionaries in the past should be corrected from the leading cadres.

Another situation is that some district and village cadres make mistakes not for work, but for personal dignity, the so-called "prestige." They do not despise and hate the oppression of the people and the tyranny of the past puppet district and township personnel and puppet baojia chiefs, but admire them endlessly. Today, the masses can stand in the position of masters and reason with the cadres and offer opinions. They do not think this is a good phenomenon, but feel that they have been underestimated and their "prestige" has been swept away. So they want to give the masses a "lesson" to see how "capable" they are. One township cadre, because the masses said that he used to carry night soil, decided to beat more people and let the masses see how "capable" he was. Many cadres in the rectification class, when examining the reasons for their hitting and scolding the masses, exposed and criticized this bad idea. A township cadre said painfully: "After I beat people, I walked in front and the masses scolded me behind my back, and I felt really sad! What kind of prestige is this?" This reflection made many people wake up.

The style of cadres has changed after rectification

After the concentrated rectification (rotational training) of cadres in various parts of East China, the phenomenon of hitting and scolding the masses has gradually been overcome, and the general style has changed. After the rectification, many cadres who had made mistakes returned to the places where they had made mistakes to apologize to the masses, make self-criticism, and ask the masses to give them opinions at any time. The masses' impression of the cadres has also begun to improve. It is generally reflected that "After all, it is the People's Government, which is different from the past. If there is a mistake, it can review and correct itself." After hearing the cadres' review, A Kang, a farmer in Sanpu Township, Cixi County, Zhejiang, who had been arrested and paraded through the streets, said very moved: "It is a good thing for the government to ask me to catch insects, and I am sorry for the government's good intentions." In the subsequent work of repairing the seawall, he became an activist. According to reports from northern Jiangsu and Fujian, during this year's summer levy, the general cadres began to use persuasion and mobilization methods to complete the task, and the style of coercive commandism was reduced. The relationship between the Party and the masses is closer than in the past, and the destructive activities of bad elements have been weakened. At present, in addition to continuing to implement the rectification to thoroughly transform all village cadres, we must also pay attention to overcoming the phenomenon of some cadres being tied up and not daring to take active responsibility after the rectification. Some comrades are now holding a negative attitude of "rather not complete the task," which should be corrected. In addition, there are still individual cases of cadres who have been rectified hitting people or coercive commandism, which must be effectively stopped. Those whose ideology is not very clear should be educated at any time in future work.

　　华东各地整风中怎样克服强迫命令作风的？
    李卿　杨刚　林韦
    华东各地整风中的最重要收获之一，是深入地揭发了带有相当普遍性的强迫命令作风。整风以前，这种作风不仅发生在一般区乡干部中，而且发生在少数县级以上领导干部中。不仅是一般地在工作中命令行事，不与群众商量，不根据群众的经验与觉悟程度办事，而且发展到打、骂、扣、罚群众，侵犯人权。这种恶劣作风的彻底批判与克服，是顺利开展与完成土地改革及领导农民进行生产建设的重要条件之一。
    揭发干部中的强迫命令作风
    这种作风发生得最普遍、最严重的，是在征收粮款中。浙江金华专区去年秋征时，曾采取自上而下逐级具保签字办法来保证完成任务。有的村庄甚至要求各户农民也都具保签字，群众不具保就不让回家。东阳县在具体进行中，曾采取扣、逼、训、攻（斗争）四套办法。有的村通夜开会，不交粮不散。福建福安县征粮中，有九十八个干部发生打骂群众等事件八百起。皖北、苏南等地，类似情形也不少。在领导生产救灾与其他工作中，强迫命令现象也很严重。浙江慈溪，苏南吴县等地有些村庄曾发生强迫规定农户捉虫（除害虫）数量，把迷信鬼神，不肯捉虫的农民弄去游街的现象。群众为完成数字（完不成要受罚），有捉蝴蝶充数的。皖南东流县在修圩六个月中，有个指挥所长每天平均扣押群众两三人。圩堤上还设有秘密禁闭室。皖南党校统计，犯过打骂群众等错误的干部占受训人数十分之七；浙江长兴整风班约占十分之八；苏南党校约占一半。强迫命令作风的普遍程度，由此可见一般。
    这些同志一致强调说：“强迫命令不好，可是能完成任务；说服动员好，就是完不成。”他们的确是“完成”了不少任务；但是这些任务“完成”之后，群众的觉悟程度非但没有随着提高，反而对党与人民政府发生怨恨，给反革命分子造成许多可乘之机。浙江嘉兴专区因此发生了被反革命分子所鼓动的农民骚动事件。但仍有不少干部不知事情的严重，仍然沿用国民党反动派的办法去镇压群众的抵抗。
    就从所谓“完成任务”来说，采取强迫命令方式的结果，也有不少越弄越僵，终于不能完成的例子。在推广棉田中，因有许多干部采取强迫多种的办法，对没种过棉的群众不做具体指导，结果有许多群众埋空堆，撒煮熟的种子。清理尾欠公粮中，有些村逼着群众写了“交粮书”到头还是交不出。这种强迫命令作风如不改正，群众还会想出更多应付办法的。
    为纠正这种恶劣作风，各地整风班（党校在内）除根据揭发出的严重事实进行批判，用产生的严重恶果警惕一般干部外，并进一步分析了犯错误的不同情况与原因。
    产生强迫命令作风的原因：
    根据各地统计，一般区乡干部的成份是好的，大都是贫苦的劳动者（成份坏的是少数）。他们对革命工作的热情一般很高，主观上想把工作做好。但是他们缺乏经验，不懂得走群众路线。而一年来的工作任务是繁多而且紧张的，这就使强迫命令有了客观基础。
    这些干部还未树立正确的群众观点。有的甚至认为群众“生来就是奴隶性”的，非强迫不行。老区来的某些干部中则有一种荒谬的论调：“新区群众长期受国民党反动统治教育，好的少，坏的多。说服动员对他们不适用。”这些同志不了解国民党反动派与封建统治者对新区人民长期的灾害，不相信只要我们能根据群众的政治经验和提高群众的觉悟程度，就一定能把党的任务变成群众自己的任务，群众就一定会行动起来，自求解放。工作中，他们只知对上级负责，不知对人民负责，不能把对上级负责与对人民负责结合起来。接受任务时，不考虑这些任务究竟有没有完成的条件与可能；只是盲目地接受，保证完成，不能对上级提供正确的情况与调查材料，帮助上级把任务决定得更正确。
    从县级以上的领导看，一般是很少对下级干部提供活的例子，以好的作法典型示范。甚至有鼓励强迫命令的。皖南祁门县长布置征粮任务时，对干部激昂地说：“我已经向专署作了保证，完不成任务拿头去见他们；你们也是一样，完不成任务拿头来见我。”旌德县长要求干部四天完成征粮任务。干部请示办法，他答：“除了打死人，什么办法都可用。”浙江诸暨县委曾表扬用打骂办法完成任务的干部。皖南池州专区则有县委、县长亲自打人的事件。有的专署整风时检讨：下面乱打乱扣现象自己并非不知，只是怕完不成任务，不敢制止。前述浙江金华专区逐级具保交粮的办法，是从专署搞起来的。这些领导机关在布置任务时，一般对下面情况缺乏认真细致的调查研究；有的是下级反映了真实情况也不注意，不做可能与必要的调整；有的擅自增加任务，如金华专区十一个县去秋曾擅自增加公粮二千六百万斤。下面执行任务的时间，却时常被上级拖拖拉拉的会议挤掉一半，弄得非常短促；再加上有的领导干部自己也蛮干，下面普遍发生强迫命令当然并不奇怪了。
    进行群众路线教育，克服强迫命令作风
    为克服工作中的强迫命令作风，各地整风班都在干部中进行了党的群众路线教育，普遍树立为人民服务、对人民负责、人民群众自己解放自己和向人民群众学习的基本群众观点。其次是由领导机关与领导干部先做自我批评，逐级弄清责任，确定今后方针和做法。再其次，最有效的办法便是拿活的事实给大家看，拿好作风的典型与坏作风对比。在苏南区党校整风中，太仓县沙溪区和武进县百丈区两个修堤的典型报告，给了大家很大启发。沙溪区事前耐心说服群众，打破顾虑；进行中处处与群众商量，顺利解决了住房等各种困难，及时表扬好的民工，鼓舞起高度劳动热情，堤修得又快又结实。百丈区不动员，不解释，强迫劳动，加上坏分子造谣煽惑，结果发生四五百人的骚动，修堤也拖延了时间。这一对比，使许多干部看清了自己应选择的办法。其他地区也有用这样作法的。因而使大部分干部开始有了走群众路线完成任务的信心。
    还有两种错误的思想作风
    此外，整风中还揭发批判了两种错误的思想作风。一种是有许多同志在肃匪反特、镇压不法地主的反革命活动、缉私以及其他维持治安的工作中，对犯法分子和嫌疑分子采取了乱捕、乱打、逼问口供的办法。他们把这些当成对付反革命和其他违法活动的最有效甚至唯一有效办法，认为这是“给群众撑腰”，认为“对群众不打骂可以，对这些人不打骂不行。”皖北阜阳专区十个县，有八个县公安局长亲自打过人。下面自然都学着来。苏北盐城专区公安处有的干部，看到下面在处理敌伪分子与户口登记中发生乱扣乱罚乱打现象而不纠正。理由是“我们虽然不提倡这种作法，但是也不能泼冷水。”对于这些同志，主要是加强政策教育，使他们了解这样做只能造成混乱，不能真正解决问题。并会给反革命活动制造许多口实。必须依照法律手续正确处理，并发动与组织群众积极协助，才能有效。过去对反革命分子“宽大无边”的，则应从领导干部予以改正。
    另一种情况，是有些区村干部犯错误并非为了工作，而是为了个人的尊严，即所谓“威信”。他们对过去的伪区乡人员和伪保甲长的欺压人民、横行霸道，不是鄙弃憎恶，而是羡慕不止。今天群众能站在主人地位与干部说理，提意见，他们不觉得这是良好的现象，而觉得是小看了自己，扫了自己的“威风”，于是要给群众个“厉害”看看。有一个乡干部因为群众说他从前是担大粪的，便决意要多打些人，叫群众看看他多有“本事”。整风班有不少干部检查自己打骂群众的原因时，揭发与批判了这种恶劣的想法。有一个乡干部痛心地说：“我打了人以后，自己在前面走，群众在后边骂，心里真是难过！这还有什么威信呢？”这种反省，使许多人清醒起来。
    整风后干部作风有了转变
    华东各地经过集中整风（轮训）的干部，现在打骂群众的现象已逐渐克服，一般作风都有了转变。整风后，有许多犯过错误的干部回到原来犯错误的地方向群众道歉，进行自我批评，要求群众随时给他提意见。群众对干部的印象也开始好转。普遍反映说：“到底是人民政府，和过去不一样，有错能自己检讨改正。”浙江慈溪县三浦乡被抓去游过街的农民阿康在听了干部检讨之后，非常感动的说：“政府叫我捉虫是好事，我对不住政府的好意。”在以后的修海塘工作中，他变成了积极分子。根据苏北与福建报告，今年夏征中，一般干部开始用说服动员办法来完成任务，强迫命令作风减少了。党与群众的关系比过去密切了，坏分子的破坏活动，作用减弱了。目前除继续贯彻整风，使所有乡村干部都能彻底转变外，还须注意克服整风后某些干部束手束脚，不敢积极负责的现象。有的同志现在抱着“宁可完不成任务”的消极态度，应予纠正。另外，经过整风的干部也还有个别发生打人或强迫命令事件的，必须给予有效制止。思想弄不很通的，应在今后工作中随时教育。
