　　In Memory of Comrade Zuo Quan
    Luo Ruiqing
    Comrade Zuo Quan was my old comrade and old comrade-in-arms. We worked together for nearly six years. Under the leadership and command of Chairman Mao, we went through the 25,000-li Long March together and spent the most difficult stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan together. On the morning of the day he sacrificed himself, we were still discussing the military arrangements for how to crush the Japanese invaders' "mopping-up" operations. Who knew that our parting in a small village in the Taihang Mountains that day would become our eternal farewell. Comrade Zuo Quan was indeed an outstanding member of our Party, an important leader of the People's Liberation Army, and a national hero in the War of Resistance Against Japan. His sacrifice was, of course, a major loss to our Party and country, but his passionate life inspires us to fight tirelessly for the consolidation of the great victory of the Chinese people and for the defense of lasting world peace! Comrade Zuo Quan, rest in peace! The Chinese people have not only defeated the fierce Japanese invaders, but have also crushed the evil rule of American imperialism and its running dog, Chiang Kai-shek, over the Chinese people. The Chinese people have won, and therefore your sacrifice has gained a noble price sufficient to allow you to die in peace. Yes, we still have enemies in front of us, and they are baring their fangs and claws, trying to retaliate against the victorious Chinese people. But all the comrades who survive dare to swear to you: Our fight will never stop until all the enemies who harm the people are eliminated. Comrade Zuo Quan, rest in peace!

　　怀念左权同志
    罗瑞卿
    左权同志，是我的老同志、老战友，我们先后同事近六年。在毛主席的领导和指挥下，一起经过二万五千里长征，一起度过抗日战争的最艰苦的阶段，直到他牺牲的当天早晨，我们还共同商讨过如何粉碎日寇“扫荡”的军事布置，谁知当天在太行山上一个小村的分手，竟成为我们之间的永别。左权同志确是我党的优秀党员，人民解放军重要的领导者，抗日战争中的民族英雄。他的牺牲，当然成为我党和国家的重大损失，但他的火热的一生，激动着我们为巩固中国人民的伟大胜利，为保卫世界的持久和平而不息的战斗！左权同志，安息吧！中国人民不仅已经战胜了凶强的日寇，而且已经摧毁了美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石对中国人民的万恶统治，中国人民已经胜利了，因而你的牺牲就已取得了高贵的足以使你死而瞑目的代价。是的，我们面前还有敌人，他们并正在张牙舞爪，企图向取得了胜利的中国人民进行报复。但是所有后死的同志都敢向你宣誓：一切残害人民的敌人不消灭，我们的战斗绝不停止。左权同志安息吧！
