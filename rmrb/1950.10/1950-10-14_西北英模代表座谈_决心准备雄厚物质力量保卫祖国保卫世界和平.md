Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 13th: The heroic model representatives from the Northwest region who attended the National Congress of Combat Heroes and Labor Models returned to Xi'an and were invited to attend a symposium convened by the Northwest Military and Political Committee on the afternoon of the 11th. Many military and political leaders and leaders of people's organizations attended the meeting. At the meeting, the heroic models reported on the spirit of the two grand meetings, and expressed their determination to defend and build the motherland. The combat heroes unanimously and resolutely opposed the US imperialist aggressor troops' crossing the 38th parallel and expanding their aggression, and expressed: in order to defend the independence and freedom of the motherland, as well as world peace, we will resolutely stand at the forefront of the battle, and strive to build a strong national defense force. The sharpshooter Bai Bingwu, reconnaissance hero Liu Jiyao, and Bian Zizheng all stated: the blood of our compatriots slaughtered by US imperialism time and time again has not yet dried, and now they are plotting to expand the war of aggression, we will never tolerate US imperialism threatening the security of our motherland. Combat hero Hu Qingshan said: "At the National Day celebration parade in Beijing, I saw the powerful strength of the people, which made me realize even more that the Chinese people have ample strength to defend the country and smash imperialist aggression."

The labor model representatives of workers and peasants also expressed one after another: we must bring Chairman Mao's instructions and the spirit of the conference back to factories and rural areas, widely mobilize workers and peasants, improve technology, promote production, and prepare strong material strength to support the liberation of Tibet and Taiwan, defend national defense, and world peace. Xinjiang industrial labor model Kerimu (Uyghur) said: Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the united strength of the people of all nationalities across the country is so powerful that this force can definitely smash the aggressive acts of US imperialism. Agricultural labor models Liu Yuhou, Wang Debiao, Liang Xiuying, Zhu Hainan, and others used their own experiences of emancipation to illustrate that "as long as we follow Chairman Mao, we will always be victorious." They also expressed their determination to defend the fruits of victory.
