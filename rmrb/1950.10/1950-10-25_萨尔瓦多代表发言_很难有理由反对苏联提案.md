　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 24th: At the afternoon session of the UN General Assembly's Political Committee on October 23rd, discussions continued on the draft declaration proposed by the Soviet delegation on "Eliminating the Threat of a New War, and Strengthening World Peace and Security."

　　The Salvadoran representative, Castro, said that, like other representatives, he needed some time to study the speech made by the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, at the morning session of the Political Committee on October 23rd. Referring to the essence of the issue under consideration, the Salvadoran representative said that some of the suggestions in the declaration were correct and it would be difficult to find reasons to oppose them. Therefore, he said he agreed with the first paragraph of the draft declaration, which called on the United Nations General Assembly to condemn war propaganda and denounce those who engage in such propaganda.

　　However, he opposed the second paragraph of the declaration, which called for the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons. He also said that the Soviet plan to ban atomic weapons did not provide for comprehensive supervision. Castro then repeated the arguments that representatives of the American bloc had already worn out when opposing the Soviet proposal for the control of atomic energy.

　　The meeting adjourned after the Salvadoran representative spoke.

　　萨尔瓦多代表发言
    很难有理由反对苏联提案
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社纽约二十四日讯：联大政治委员会十月二十三日下午会议上，继续讨论苏联代表团提出的“制止新战争威胁，巩固世界和平与安全”的宣言草案。
    萨尔瓦多代表卡斯特罗说，他也像其他代表一样，需要一点时间来研究苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在政委会十月二十三日上午会议上的发言。谈到在审议中的这个问题的本质时，萨尔瓦多代表说，宣言内有某些建议是很正确的，很难有理由加以反对。因此他说，宣言草案的第一段要在联合国大会谴责新战争宣传，并斥责那些进行此种宣传的人，这是他同意的。
    然而他反对宣言的第二段，即要求无条件禁止原子武器的一段。他又说是苏联禁止原子武器的计划并未规定进行全面的监督。卡斯特罗接着又重复美国集团的代表们在反对苏联提出的管制原子能计划时已经说烂了的议论。
    萨尔瓦多代表发言后会议即休会。
