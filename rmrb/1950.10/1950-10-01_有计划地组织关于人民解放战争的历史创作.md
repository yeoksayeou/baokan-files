　　Planned Organization of Historical Creation on the People's Liberation War
    Chen Huangmei
    The victory of the Chinese people is, in effect, a great revolutionary war history.

    From the perspective of the troops, from the establishment of the Red Army to the 25,000-li Long March, to the War of Resistance, to the victory of the Liberation War, this army has grown from small to large, from guerrilla units to regularization, from decentralization to unification, from guerrilla warfare to mastering modern weapons for large-scale mobile warfare and positional warfare. For more than twenty years, it has fought and grown stronger in various difficult environments. Regardless of its strategic and tactical thinking and political work, it has undergone different ideological struggles, further proving the extremely brilliant and correct leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu in establishing the Chinese People's Revolutionary Armed Forces in a series of issues. Our armed struggle, these twenty-plus years of revolutionary war, is a concentrated expression of the Chinese people's revolutionary forces and a supreme form of organization. The length of its struggle, the scale of its operations, the arduousness of the environment, and the intricate and complex nature of the war situation are rare in the world.

    From other perspectives, whether it was the establishment of our Party and the people's political power, the work of the Party and the political power, or economic construction during the Land Revolution, the War of Resistance, and the Liberation War, all were established, developed, and consolidated under the general premise of supporting the front and developing production. The mass work in all base areas and liberated areas revolved around the central link of war. The development of the democratic movement under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang was also inspired by the victory of the Liberation War and combined with the war.

    In short, the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle is inextricably linked to war. Accurately reflecting the epic of the People's Liberation War has great educational significance for revolutionary people worldwide and for the Chinese people (especially the younger generation). If we cannot accurately reflect the Chinese People's Liberation War, it will be impossible to correctly reflect the Chinese people's revolutionary history; or, more precisely, we will fail to reflect the main aspects of the Chinese revolutionary struggle.

    Precisely because the revolutionary war was long, arduous, and brutal, and was continuously ongoing, in the past, the troops could not have sufficient manpower and time to collect and organize these epics. In recent years, there have been many excellent creations reflecting the People's Liberation War, which is very gratifying. However, compared with the great Liberation War, it still seems insufficient; particularly lacking are works that reflect the larger or more important battles of the Liberation War and can write about their strategic thinking and senior command. For the entire history of the revolutionary war, literary creation still leaves a large void.

    Therefore, I feel that in the future, historical creation related to the Liberation War should be organized in a planned way. On the National Day commemoration, when all construction will move forward from this starting point, it is necessary to put forward this task in the field of literary and artistic work. Comrades working in film, drama, literature, and fine arts should strive to create in this area. Soviet literature and art have given us good inspiration—especially in the field of film, where the greatest effort is used to concentrate on showing some major wars, which is worth our good reference.

    It is not easy for us to carry out this work, and there are some objective limitations. For example, during the war, military and political organs did not do a good job of collecting and organizing historical materials from various aspects of the troops in a timely manner. Not many literary and art workers participated in the war, and some were not deep enough. Due to the urgent restrictions of the war in the past, political workers have long been in a state of war gaps for recuperation, adopting short-term blitz and piecemeal propaganda and mobilization work, lacking in-depth and systematic ideological education, coupled with the lack of cultivation of troops literary and art workers in various aspects, which affected the literary and artistic creation, there are empiricist practices, accustomed to the enumeration of phenomena or collecting and sorting out materials piecemeal, and not good at synthesizing and summarizing, comprehensively reflecting the troops ... These limitations have greatly hindered us from deeply reflecting the People's Liberation War. In particular, it is very difficult and laborious to require the reflection of important battles, senior generals, and Chairman Mao's strategic thinking in such highly ideological creations.

    But these difficulties must be overcome, this task must be clearly put forward, and only by solving these problems can literary and artistic creation reflecting the war break through this barrier and improve further. Therefore, this creative task should be promoted in a planned and organized way from all aspects.

    I hope that the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles will provide concrete guidance and help to this work in terms of calling, organizing creation, and editing and publishing, and encourage literary and artistic creation reflecting the war.

    Secondly, military and political organs at all levels should systematically collect and organize past war historical materials, which should become a regular task, starting from the smallest things, combined with the troops' reorganization and training, cultural learning, organizing heroic model deeds and memories, seminars, and interviews of war and troop history to accumulate materials in various forms. Those who have been engaged in war history writing should also absorb more literary and art workers to participate.

    In carrying out these tasks, we must patiently give various assistance to literary and art workers, especially to strengthen the ideological leadership of literary and artistic creation. Regardless of the collection, sorting out, and research of materials, military and political leading cadres should first clarify the overall aspects—such as the operational deployment and plan at the time of the important battle, the intentions of the leadership, etc.—so as to be more systematic and ideologically clearer.

    In short, I think we should at least start to study such a task now and start from the smallest things; to unfold the historical page of the great People's Liberation War in an organized way, to commemorate the thousands upon thousands of People's Liberation Army martyrs who sacrificed for the people and for the motherland!

　　有计划地组织关于人民解放战争的历史创作
    陈荒煤
    中国人民的胜利，实际上是一部伟大的革命战争历史。
    从部队方面来看，自红军创立开始到二万五千里长征，到抗战时期，到解放战争的胜利，这一支军队从小到大，从游击队到正规化，从分散到统一，从游击战到掌握近代化武器作大规模运动战阵地战，二十余年来，曾经在各种不同的艰苦的环境中作战而壮大起来；无论其战略战术思想与政治工作等等，也经过不同的思想斗争，愈证明毛主席和朱总司令在建立中国人民革命武装这一系列的问题上，有其极英明极正确的领导。我们的武装斗争，这二十多年的革命战争，是中国人民革命力量的集中表现和一种最高的组织形式；其斗争时期之长，作战规模之大，环境的艰苦，战争形势之错综复杂，为世所罕见。
    从其他方面来看，无论在土地革命时期，抗战时期，解放战争时期，我们党和人民政权的建立，党和政权的工作及经济建设等等，也都是在支援前线发展生产这一个总前提之下建立、发展和巩固起来的。一切根据地及解放区的群众工作，无不环绕着战争这一个中心环节。而在国民党反动统治下的民主运动的开展，也是为解放战争的胜利所鼓舞，与战争相结合的。
    总之，中国人民革命的斗争无一不和战争息息相关。正确地反映人民解放战争的史诗，对于全世界革命人民，对于中国人民（特别是青年一代）有伟大的教育意义。如果我们不能很好地反映中国人民解放战争，也就不可能正确地反映中国人民的革命历史；或者，更确切地说，没有反映中国革命斗争的主要方面。
    也正因为革命战争的长期、艰苦和残酷，是在连续不断的进行中，过去部队方面还不可能有充裕人力和时间来搜集与整理这些史诗。近年来在反映人民解放战争方面已有不少优秀的创作了，是非常可喜的事情。然而与伟大的解放战争相比较，就显得还不够；特别感到不足的，是缺乏反映解放战争较大或较重要的战役，而能写出其战略思想及高级指挥方面的情形者。对于革命战争的整个历史来讲，文艺创作还留下很大的空白。
    因此，我感到，今后应该有计划地来组织有关解放战争的历史创作。在国庆纪念日，在一切建设将都以此为起点向前迈进的时候，在文艺工作方面，把这个工作任务提出来是必要的。无论是电影、戏剧、文学、美术的工作同志应该努力在这方面来进行创作。苏联的文艺已经给了我们很好的启示——特别是电影方面，用最大努力来集中表现一些主要的战争，值得我们很好的参考。
    我们进行这个工作并不是很容易的，有一些客观条件的限制，比如过去战争期间，军政机关没有很好地及时地去收集和整理部队各方面的历史材料。文艺工作者参加战争还不多，有的还不够深入；由于过去战争急迫的限制，政治工作者长期是在一种战争空隙中进行休整，采取短期突击的和片断的宣传鼓动工作多，深入而有系统的思想教育不足，再加上部队文艺工作者各方面的修养不够，以致影响到文艺创作存在着经验主义的作法，习惯于现象的罗列或零碎地收集整理材料，而不善于综合和概括，全面地来反映部队……这些限制就大大妨碍了我们深刻地反映人民解放战争。特别是要求反映重要的战役，高级将领和毛主席战略思想这样的有高度思想性的创作，就感到非常困难和吃力。
    但这些困难必须克服，这个任务必须明确提出，也只有解决这些问题，反映战争的文艺创作方能突破这一关，更提高一步。正因此，要把这个创作任务有计划有组织地，从各方面来推动。
    我希望中央人民政府文化部，中国人民解放军总政治部文化部以及全国文联在号召、组织创作以及编辑出版各方面都给这个工作以具体指导和帮助并多多鼓励反映战争的文艺创作。
    其次，各级军政机关要有组织地来收集整理过去战争史料，应该成为一种经常性的工作，从点滴作起，结合部队的整训，文化学习，组织英模事迹和战役和部队历史的回忆、座谈、访问，以各种形式积累素材。已进行战史写作工作的，更应多吸收文艺工作者参加。
    在进行这些工作中，必须耐心地给文艺工作者各种帮助，特别要加强文艺创作的思想领导，无论是材料的收集、整理和研究，军政领导干部最好先在总的方面——比如重要战役当时的作战布置与计划，领导的意图等等——予以阐明，以便更有系统，思想更明确。
    总之，我想现在至少应该开始着手来研究这样一个工作，并先从点滴作起；有组织地来展开伟大人民解放战争的史页，来纪念那千千万万为人民、为祖国而牺牲的人民解放军的烈士们！
