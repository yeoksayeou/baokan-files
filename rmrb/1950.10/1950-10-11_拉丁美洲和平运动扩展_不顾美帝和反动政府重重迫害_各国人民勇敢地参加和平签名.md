Xinhua News Agency, October 10th: The Latin American peace movement, defying heavy persecution by U.S. imperialism and reactionary governments in various places, is continuing to develop.

In Cuba, following the "Wu Bao" published on August 30th, the "Cuba Vanguard" was launched on September 10th, jointly raising the banner of the progressive newspaper "Today's News" which had been sealed off. The editorial of the inaugural issue of "Cuba Vanguard" listed the newspaper's plan as striving for a Cuban constitution that safeguards the people's freedom, national independence, workers' and peasants' welfare, and condemns wars of aggression. Cuban mothers recently held a peace conference in the capital, Havana. Leaders of the Cuban Democratic Women's Federation, Audega, and Mexican representative Morales delivered speeches at the meeting, calling for expanding the struggle for peace, which was warmly applauded.

In Argentina, the U.S. Embassy, through its agents in Argentina—Police Chief Bertolo and Congressman Colom, etc.—vigorously worked to ban the Communist Party and persecute progressive trade unions and the peace movement. The Santa Fe authorities recently arrested forty workers who were collecting signatures for peace. However, the peace-loving people of Argentina, with the efforts of one hundred local committees, continued to expand the signature campaign, reaching 800,000 signatures in the capital and Buenos Aires Province (where the capital is located). Women in Argentina are also very active in the peace signature campaign, having collected 300,000 signatures.

In addition, in Brazil, where the Communist Party has been declared illegal, peace fighters have collected 1.25 million signatures on the peace declaration. Brazilian peace advocates held a national peace conference in the capital, Rio de Janeiro, on September 8th and 9th, and elected a delegation to attend the Second World Peace Congress. In Puerto Rico, a U.S. colony with a population of two million, peace fighters have also collected 8,000 signatures on the peace declaration. Many local peace committees have been established in various towns in Puerto Rico. Under the powerful voice of people's protests, dozens of peace fighters arrested under the orders of the U.S. authorities have been released. Local peace advocates will also send a delegation to participate in the World Peace Congress to be held in London in November.

    不顾美帝和反动政府重重迫害
    各国人民勇敢地参加和平签名
    【新华社十日讯】拉丁美洲的和平运动，不顾美帝国主义和各地反动政府的重重迫害，正在继续发展中。
    在古巴，继八月三十日出刊的“午报”之后，又有“古巴先锋报”于九月十日创刊，一同举起已被查封的进步报纸“今日新闻”的旗帜。“古巴先锋报”创刊号的社论，列举该报的计划是争取一个维护人民自由、民族独立、工农福利，以及斥责侵略战争的古巴宪法。古巴的母亲们最近曾在首都哈瓦那举行争取和平会议，古巴民主妇女联合会领袖奥黛佳和墨西哥的代表摩拉里斯在会上发表演说，号召扩大争取和平的斗争，受到热烈的欢呼。
    在阿根廷，美国大使馆通过其在阿根廷的特务——警察局长柏托洛和国会议员科洛姆等，大力活动取缔共产党和迫害进步的工会与和平运动。圣大非当局最近逮捕四十名征集和平签名的工人。但阿根廷爱好和平的人民，在一百个地方委员会努力下，继续扩大签名运动，在首都和布宜诺斯艾利斯省（首都所在省），签名达八十万人。阿根廷的妇女在和平签名运动中也很活跃，已征集了三十万个签名。
    此外，在共产党已被宣布非法的巴西，和平战士已征集到一百二十五万人在和平宣言上签了名。巴西和平拥护者曾于九月八日和九日在首都里约热内卢举行全国和平大会，选出了出席第二届世界和平大会的代表团。在有二百万人口的美国殖民地波多黎各，和平战士也征集了八千个人在和平宣言上签了名。许多地方和平委员会已在波多黎各的各城镇建立起来。在人民抗议的声威之下，奉美国当局命令逮捕起来的几十个和平战士已获得释放。该地和平拥护者亦将派遣一个代表团参加定十一月在伦敦举行的世界和平大会。
