　　The US Imperialist Armed Aggression Against Korea (Originally published in "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese version, Issue 56)
　　(Hall, National Secretary of the Communist Party of the United States)
　　This meeting must address some new political and tactical issues arising from the current new world situation. This new situation has emerged because US imperialism, in its imperialist development process, has moved from one stage – from the stage of intensifying arms preparations, from the stage of the Truman-Marshall Plan that supplies weapons and establishes puppet regimes – to the stage of open military aggression. This policy of open military aggression is not limited to Korea, and we must not regard this as a "Korean incident." Moreover, this military aggression is not limited to Asia. We must fully recognize that, now, military aggression is a central component of US foreign policy, and it intends to implement this policy not only in Korea and Asia but throughout the world. Wherever there are people fighting for freedom, wherever there are national liberation struggles, wherever the working class is advancing towards socialism, the armed forces of the United States will be used against the people. This is a universally applicable truth.

　　I would like to draw your attention to a new and important fact, which is that US foreign policy and Wall Street's entire mad plan to dominate the world have entered a new stage characterized by open military intervention in the internal affairs of other countries and peoples.

　　Millions of people around the world now see the naked aggressiveness of US imperialism. Hatred for the United States is growing dramatically in every corner of the world. During World War II, a feeling of hatred arose among the people of the world because of Hitler's Germany – hatred of everything German; now, due to Wall Street's enslavement, that feeling has transformed into hatred of everything American. The path of struggle taken by the Korean people against US intervention in their fight for independence is a glorious page in the history of national liberation struggles. The indomitable courage, high fighting spirit, powerful unity, and firm leadership demonstrated by a long-oppressed nation facing the powerful blows of the world's largest capitalist power are beyond description.

　　These developments are not surprising to the entire Party; because, under the capable leadership of Foster and Dennis, our Party correctly analyzed the role of US imperialism as early as the 1945 Congress. We pointed out that as long as the United States continues to pursue a foreign policy of dominating the world, this policy will inevitably lead to actions like the one in Korea and other similar acts of aggression.

　　We must point out that if this provocative war had not occurred in Korea, it would inevitably have occurred elsewhere. The policy of US imperialism has long been a policy of attempting to provoke wars one after another. Only this reason can explain why the US fleet "visited" Vietnam two or three months ago, when the United States attempted to create some incidents there as a pretext for its aggression. Only this reason can explain its armed assistance to Chiang Kai-shek, its arms aid to France and the Netherlands against the liberation struggles in Indonesia and Vietnam, and the five hundred military bases it has established around the world. The meeting in Tokyo between Dulles, Johnson, Bradley, and MacArthur was not a meeting where the decision to take action in Korea was made for the first time, but merely a review of their already formulated plans and a decision on the date of action.

　　We must continue to emphasize that the war waged by the United States in Korea is an unjust war, a war of aggression, an imperialist war.

　　★

　　Here I would like to talk about the position of the American people. I think that even within our Party, there are still many speculations about the consequences of US imperialism's success or failure in Korea. I want to talk about my views. If the US military progresses smoothly in Korea, this will encourage Wall Street to move forward and expand the war in many places in Asia. If the US military suffers a defeat, on the one hand, this will certainly increase Wall Street and Washington's frantic struggle, but it will encourage the peace forces in our country and the world, and it will make it more difficult for Wall Street to launch new adventures.

　　The only way for the United States to escape this chaotic situation is to change its foreign policy, that is to say, to temporarily retreat due to the pressure of the American people, or to fundamentally change the government, which can only be achieved by the American people themselves. The Korean people cannot change this policy, and this change can only be accomplished by the growth of the peace movement and the democratic forces within our country. Therefore, we must fully recognize our own position and make the American people aware of this.

　　Now, let's talk about the second question: if Wall Street's goal in Korea is not to immediately launch a Third World War, then what are Wall Street's immediate goals? Its goals are as follows:

　　(1) To crush the national liberation movements in Asia and completely seize the colonies' oil, tin mines, rubber, and, of course, cheap labor.

　　(2) To accelerate the signing of a separate peace treaty with Japan and turn Japan into a military base; it must achieve this goal in order to establish this base to facilitate its further expansion and launch a Third World War.

　　(3) To expel China and the Soviet Union from the United Nations.

　　(4) To deal with the world peace movement, especially the burgeoning peace movement in the United States. Acheson's statement illustrates how seriously they take peace petitions and the growth of the entire peace movement.

　　(5) To avert the developing economic crisis.

　　(6) To take further measures to accelerate the fascization of the United States.

　　(7) Finally, to use this entire development to intensify preparations for a world war.

　　We must ask ourselves: can US imperialism achieve these goals? I think that no matter how much they boast in the newspapers, we can be assured that US imperialism cannot achieve these goals. Each of these goals will fail, and it will have to retreat or collapse completely.

　　If Wall Street is not prepared to launch a world war at the moment, why did it get involved in Korea, and why particularly at this time? It is important for us to understand this issue. Clearly, there are many developments that Wall Street cannot control and that its power cannot influence. The first of these is the continuous bankruptcy of US foreign policy; US foreign policy has been continuously hit hard in the face of the rising liberation movements in Asia and the Pacific, which is manifested in the defeat of its puppets, first of course its puppets in China, and also its puppets in Korea, Vietnam, and a series of other countries.

　　But it is not limited to Asia. When Wall Street provoked the war in Korea, we must not ignore all its difficulties in Europe. The repeated cabinet crises in the French government are a symbol of these difficulties. First, the continued growth of the peace movement and the fact that, no matter what, US imperialism has failed to destroy the influence of the communist parties in Europe, especially in countries like France and Italy. All of these are evidence of the bankruptcy of US foreign policy.

　　However, the United States is not the only one facing these difficulties that prevent it from achieving its goals. Britain and France are also facing similar difficulties. This has further created a psychology of frantic struggle in Wall Street and the entire capitalist world.

　　This explains why this current act of challenge exists, and why Korea has become one of the chosen targets, apart from the reason that Korea happens to be the most important base on the continent for attacking China and the Soviet Union.

　　★

　　We must constantly and clearly answer the questions that exist in the minds of the American people. They are asking about everything that is happening. If you read the columns in the newspapers, you will understand that this is exactly what they are doing today. They have never asked such specific questions as they do today and have been forced to pursue answers.

　　Let us explain what kind of questions we must give a clear answer to; of course, such questions are not easy to answer. I think there are quite a few people who are trying to get simple answers, they are conveniently taking answers out of their pockets without any factual basis. For example, let's take a look at Lippmann's "question." In order to "prove" that US imperialism is not an aggressor in Korea, he said: we were all caught off guard, how can we be aggressors; who can say that we were prepared to carry out aggression, if everyone is clear that we are inferior to them in terms of quantity, armaments, and everything else? We must deal with these questions, because this kind of statement will have a certain effect on the thinking of the American people.

　　Generally, we must deal with this issue in the following way: yes, the imperialists were caught off guard and unprepared for what happened in Korea. In order to launch this act of aggression, what they were prepared for was to let the South Koreans fight this war - they had already trained 100,000 troops for South Korea. They were prepared for the war by thinking that as soon as American tanks and artillery appeared, the North Koreans would surrender. However, the opposite was true. What they did not expect - and therefore felt caught off guard - was the South Koreans' refusal to massacre their own compatriots. What surprised and flustered them even more was the unanimous opposition of the Korean people to their aggression. Only this is what they were not prepared for. They were not prepared for dealing with the wave of a national liberation movement, for the great heroism of a nation fighting for liberation and against colonial enslavement!

　　Moreover, we must understand that today's colonial liberation movement is very different from what it was twenty or thirty years ago. The difference is due to the experience accumulated in recent years. We certainly cannot overestimate the impact of the Chinese people's armed struggle on all colonial peoples. But this experience is not limited to China, it has a major impact on the entire colonial liberation movement. In Korea, it is manifested in what these previously colonial peoples have learned from this experience today. I also think that we have not given enough consideration to the influence of the increasingly powerful Soviet Union on the colonial masses. The victory of the Russian socialist revolution has a decisive role in the development of the colonial liberation movement. The success of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, the victory over fascism and Japanese militarism, and the first to advocate sovereign integrity and the equality of all peoples - all of these have expanded the spiritual leadership of the Soviet Union. Moreover, in every colony, there are actually millions of people today who have years of experience in armed struggle against colonial rulers and national traitors. They know why they are fighting, and they also know how to fight.

　　Secondly, the question that is still a bit confusing is: are we still taking the struggle for peace as our central task; and is the peaceful coexistence of two systems still a key point in our program and vision?

　　We must clearly recognize that the peace struggle understood by Marxists does not mean acknowledging the current world situation, nor does it mean delaying the struggle for socialism. Our concept of striving for peace is definitely not like this, nor is the concept of Marxists like this. Because, this concept is equal to accepting enslavement to buy peace.

　　In fact, peace is only guaranteed when society moves forward and when people have the right to decide their own destiny. In any other situation, it is impossible to achieve peace.

　　Among the people, we must make them recognize an undeniable fact, that is, liberated people are the most powerful force in defending world peace; the liberation of Asia, the people's struggle to break free from imperialist rule, is the strongest foundation for peace in Asia. Within our Party, we must deepen the understanding of our members, that is, in the national liberation struggle, we do not take a neutral position, and of course, the same is true in the struggle for socialism. Our peace policy arises from this understanding.

　　★

　　Let's talk more about the general mass work, especially about the united front. I think we should start by acknowledging that we are facing many difficulties. Afterwards, there will continue to be attempts to instigate war hysteria in the United States, to intimidate the masses in various ways, especially to intimidate the peace movement and our Party. Every day, people distributing pamphlets and collecting peace signatures are arrested. There are arrests in every state. In the past few days, there have been eighteen arrests in Philadelphia. The same situation exists in states such as Alabama. The attacks on our Party, whether by "legal," illegal, or "extra-legal" means, will intensify day by day.

　　Within days or weeks, the Mundt-Ferguson Bill is in danger of being passed, and we should certainly be vigilant about this threat. There will be more people deported later (there have been many deportation hearings). Moreover, there will be a general offensive against all strikes. Truman's statement on the railway strike is just one example of what we expected.

　　Regarding our mass work, I would like to emphasize a second thing. We need to stubbornly fight against pessimistic and panicked sentiments. This sentiment is due to overestimating the enemy and underestimating what the American people can do and will do.

　　This is a test for the leadership of our Party. During this period, the leadership must push our Party into action, strengthen confidence, and increase enthusiasm in future struggles.

　　Here I would like to talk about a central issue. We must see that the impact of the war on our country now is not the same as the impact of the last war. It can also be said that it is different from the past two wars. The situation in which the United States is in this war is different from the past wars. In the past two wars, other countries and other people were actually engaged in the war, while Wall Street sat back and enjoyed the fruits of their labor, and stingily threw some breadcrumbs to the American people. In the past two wars, it was other countries, not the United States, that suffered huge economic losses. In this war, the United States will be forced to suffer serious losses in all aspects, economically, politically, materially... etc. This is a new situation for the United States.

　　Secondly, the US economy has already become biased, and as the war economy occupies a large proportion of our national economy day by day, it will continue to develop in that direction. This situation will create many new problems. I think that even in our ranks, there are many misconceptions that the domestic situation will be the same as it was during the last war. Of course, this is wrong. The nature of World War II and the fact that the United States stood on the united front against Hitler helped to alleviate the blow and prevent Wall Street's attack on the American people. There is no doubt that the imperialist nature of this war will produce a comprehensive attack on the working class and black people in the country, on a scale never seen in our country. The plan to enslave the Asian people and the plan to enslave the American people will go hand in hand.

　　These developments will create some objective conditions for expanding mass work. In fact, the reaction to the Korean incident among the people did not show "enthusiastic support" for this war. Why is the United States fighting in Korea? There are many doubts and hesitations about this question. In the country, the fear of atomic warfare is increasing day by day, and the fact is exactly like this. These situations create the possibility of expanding our activities.

　　Regarding the issue of mass work, it is important to emphasize some things directly to our Party. First of all, we must emphasize that every Communist Party member and every Party group must give play to personal and group initiative. Have the courage to clarify our position in front of the masses, rather than treating the hysterical reaction of a small number of people as the real sentiment of the broad masses.

　　We must make our Party believe that, under any circumstances, the united front strategy must be applied. We must never accept the wrong view that the greater the blows and the more difficulties, the more we should reduce our mass work and the activities of the united front. The situation where our Party does not give leadership to the working class, or does not launch a united front struggle around the work of defending the interests of the masses, will not exist.

　　★

　　Let's talk about some specific tasks. First, the struggle for peace. This is still our central issue. Collecting peace signatures in the struggle for peace is an important issue. It is particularly important because some areas have just started. Our Party must continue to launch the signature campaign.

　　Of course, it is wrong to say that peace petitioning is the only major activity in the peace movement. While continuing this work, we must also increase some other activities to the same extent. These tasks include movements such as "non-interference in Korea" and "US troops withdraw from Korea." This is a very important movement, and we must try to launch it, and it can be launched.

　　Some people may not support the "non-interference in Korea" movement, but will support other issues. For example, many people will actively support the demand for People's China to attend the United Nations. Some people believe that Korea and Taiwan are two different things, and will support the demand for the United States to withdraw from Taiwan, and support the implementation of the provisions of the Cairo and Potsdam Declarations, returning Taiwan to China. If we cannot mobilize them on the overall Korean issue, we can mobilize them in these areas.

　　In the peace signature campaign, we must pay attention to establishing peace organizations in a timely manner - various peace committees. It is particularly important to establish the Labor Peace Congress as a truly mass organization.

　　With the current developments, it is necessary to adjust the Party so that it is ready to be mobilized urgently at any time. We must ask ourselves, is the Party ready to mobilize quickly, for example, when an important new development requires contact with the masses, and to win the masses to take rapid action on one issue or another upon receiving a brief notice, can our Party immediately organize thousands of open-air mass rallies? We must ensure that our Party's organization is fully prepared to take emergency mobilization at any time when a particularly urgent issue arises.

　　Finally, I don't think I have to emphasize that our Party and our leadership are facing truly serious tasks under the new situation. The working class all over the world is watching the United States, more attentively than any other country, to see what will happen here. This is understandable. Whatever we do, no matter how small, will have a reaction around the world, and its impact will expand beyond our borders. In this sense, we should understand our responsibility, we must calmly look at the new situation, the new difficulties; however, we must also calmly look at the new possible developments. While the blows against our Party will expand, we will win new allies in the struggle against Wall Street imperialism. We will never give up any of our Party's legal status without going through various struggles, and we will win new strength to resist Wall Street's offensive to outlaw our Party.

　　Comrades, at this time, any pessimistic sentiments are inappropriate. World capitalism has reason to be pessimistic. History is on the side of the working class - on the side of the forces striving for social progress.

　　美帝国主义在朝鲜的武装侵略  （原载《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》中文版第五十六期）
    （美国共产党全国书记霍尔）
    这个会议必须处理由于目前新的世界形势而产生的一些新的政治与战术问题。这个新形势的出现是因为美帝国主义在它的帝国主义发展过程中已经从一个阶段——从加紧备战的阶段，从供应武器和建立傀儡政权的杜鲁门马歇尔计划的这个阶段——进入到公开的军事侵略阶段。这种公开军事侵略的政策还不仅限于在朝鲜，我们决不能把这看做是一个“朝鲜事件”。而且这个军事侵略还不仅限于亚洲。我们必须充分认识，现在，军事侵略是美国外交政策的一个中心环节，它不仅想在朝鲜和亚洲，而且想在全世界推行这个政策。凡是有人民在为自由而斗争的地方，凡是有民族解放斗争的地方，凡是工人阶级在向着社会主义迈进的地方，美国的武装力量就会被使用来反对人民。这是放诸四海而皆准的。
    我愿提请你们注意一个新的重要事实，那就是，美国的外交政策以及华尔街整个的独霸世界的疯狂计划已经进入了一个以公开军事干涉其他国家和人民内政为特征的新阶段。
    全世界的千百万人民现在都看到了美帝国主义的赤裸裸的侵略性。对于美国的仇恨在世界的每个角落剧烈地增长着。第二次世界大战时期，因为希特勒德国的原故，在世界人民中间产生了一种仇恨的感情——仇恨德国的一切；现在，由于华尔街的奴役行为，这样的感情已经转变为仇恨美国的一切。朝鲜人民为争取独立反对美国干涉而采取的战斗道路是民族解放斗争史上光荣的一页。面对着目前全球最大资本主义强国的强大打击的和长久被压迫的民族，所表现的那种不屈不挠的勇气，高度的战斗士气，有力的团结以及坚定的领导，是无法用文字来形容的。
    这些发展对于整个的党来说并不是一件值得惊讶的事情；因为，在福斯特和但尼斯的有才能的领导之下，我们党早在一九四五年的大会上即已正确分析了美帝国主义的作用。我们曾经指出，只要美国一天继续推行独霸世界的外交政策，这个政策就会无可避免地走向像对朝鲜这种行动和其他类似的攻击行为。
    我们必须指出，如果这种挑衅战争没有在朝鲜发生，它必然会在其他地方发生。美帝国主义的政策早就是一种企图接二连三挑起战争的政策。只有这个理由才能解释为什么两三个月前美国舰队去“访问”越南，那一次美国企图在当地制造一些事件来作为它侵略的借口。只有这个理由才能解释它对蒋介石的武装援助，它以军火援助法国与荷兰以反对印尼和越南的解放斗争，以及它在全世界所建立的五百个军事基地。杜勒斯、詹森和布莱德雷与麦克阿瑟在东京的会议并不是一次对朝鲜采取行动第一次作决定的会议，而只是检查一下他们早已制订的计划并且决定一下行动的日子而已。
    我们必须继续强调指出，美国在朝鲜的战争是一个非正义的战争，一个侵略战争，一个帝国主义战争。
                                ★
    在这里我想谈一谈关于美国人民所处的地位。我想，甚至在我们党内，对于美帝国主义在朝鲜的胜败所将产生的后果还有许多种推想。我要说一说我的看法。假如美军在朝鲜进行顺利，这将鼓励华尔街在亚洲许多地方向前推进一步扩大战争。假如美军吃了败仗，一方面这固然会增加华尔街和华盛顿当局的疯狂挣扎，但它会鼓励我国和全世界的和平力量，并且会使得华尔街更难于展开新的冒险行动。
    美国能否从这个混乱局面中跳出来的唯一道路就是转变外交政策，那就是说，由于美国人民的压力而不得不暂时的撤退，或者把政府根本加以改变，这同样也只有靠美国人民自己才能达成。朝鲜人民不可能改变这种政策，这个改变只可能由和平运动的成长和我们国内的民主力量来完成。因此，我们必须充分认识到自己所处的地位并且使美国人民也认识到这一点。
    现在谈第二个问题：假如华尔街在朝鲜的目的不是立刻掀起一个第三次世界大战来，那么，华尔街眼前的目的是些什么呢？它的目的有以下几个：
    （一）粉碎亚洲的民族解放运动，完全取得殖民地的石油、锡矿、橡胶，当然还有廉价的劳动力。
    （二）加速与日本签订单独的和约，把日本变成一个军事基地；为了建立起这个基地以利于它的进一步扩张和掀起第三次世界大战，它必须达到这个目的。
    （三）把中国和苏联逐出联合国。
    （四）对付世界和平运动，特别是在美国正在蓬勃生长的和平运动。艾奇逊的声明正说明了他们把和平请愿和整个和平运动的壮大看得如何严重。
    （五）闪开在发展中的经济危机。
    （六）采取进一步手段，加速美国的法西斯化。
    （七）最后，利用整个的这种发展来加紧世界大战的准备。
    我们必须问问自己：美帝国主义能达到这些目的吗？我想，不管他们怎样在报纸上大吹大擂，我们可以有保证地说美帝国主义是不能达到这些目的的。它这些目的一个个都将失败，它将不得不退却或者全部垮台。
    假如说华尔街在目前还不准备发动世界大战，为什么它要搞朝鲜，而且为什么特别在这个时机搞呢？对于我们，了解这个问题是很重要的。很清楚的，有许多发展是华尔街所不能控制的，是它的力量所不能影响的。其中的第一项就是美国外交政策的不断破产；在亚洲和太平洋高涨着的解放运动面前，美国的外交政策不断遭到打击，这表现在它的傀儡给击败了，这首先当然是它在中国的傀儡，还有就是在朝鲜、越南以及一连串的许多国家内的傀儡。
    但是，还不仅限于亚洲。当华尔街在朝鲜挑起战争的时候，我们决不能忽视它在欧洲所有的困难。法国政府的一再发生阁潮正是这些困难的一个象征。首先是和平运动的继续成长以及无论怎样美帝国主义一直未能破坏在欧洲共产党所产生的影响，特别是在像法国意大利这样的国家。所有这些都是美国外交政策破产的证据。
    然而，面对着这些使其不能达到目标的困难的还不只是美国。英法两国也面对着类似的困难。这就在华尔街和整个资本主义世界里进一步造成了疯狂挣扎的心理。
    这说明了目前这种挑战行为为什么会有，以及为什么朝鲜变成了被选择的对象之一，除了因为朝鲜正好是在大陆上进攻中国和苏联的最重要基地这个理由而外。
                                ★
    我们必须不断地、明确地解答存在于美国人民脑子中的问题。他们要问的是发生着的每一件事情。假如你读一读报纸上的专栏，你就会了解这正是他们今天所做的事情。他们从来没有像今天这样提出如此具体的问题而且被迫不得不去追求解答。
    让我们说明一下什么样的问题是我们必须给予一个明确答案的；当然，这样的问题不是容易解答的。我认为，很有一些人是在企图求得简单的答案，他们是顺手从口袋里摸出答案来而并无事实的根据。例如，让我们来看一看李普曼的一个“问题”。为了“证明”美帝国主义不是在朝鲜的侵略者，他说：我们都是措手不及，怎么还能成为侵略者；谁能说我们是有准备地进行侵略，假如人人都很清楚我们在数量上军火上以及其他种种都不如他们？我们必须应付这些问题，因为这样一类的说法在美国人民的思想上是会产生一定作用的。
    大体上我们必须用下面这种方式去应付这个问题：是的，帝国主义者对于在朝鲜所发生的事情；是措手不及和没有准备。为了展开这个侵略行为，他们所准备的是让南朝鲜人去打这个仗——他们业已为南朝鲜训练了十万军队。他们对于战争的准备是以为只要美国的坦克和大炮一出现，北朝鲜人就会投降了。但是，事实恰恰相反。他们所没有料到的——从而也就感到措手不及的——是南朝鲜人的拒绝屠杀自己的同胞。更使他们感到惊讶慌张的是朝鲜人一致反对他们的侵略。只有这一点是他们所没有准备好的。对于应付一个民族解放运动的浪潮，对于为了求得解放和反对殖民地奴役而战斗的一个民族的伟大英雄主义，他们是没有准备的！
    而且，我们必须懂得：今天殖民地解放运动与二十年或三十年前大不相同。所以不同是由于近年来所积累的经验。我们固然不能过高估计中国人民武装斗争给予所有殖民地人民的影响。但这种经验是不仅限于中国国内的，对整个殖民地解放运动都有重大的影响。在朝鲜就表现出来这些先前还是殖民地人民今天从这种经验中学到了什么。我也认为，日益强大的苏联所给予殖民地群众的影响我们也没有给以足够的估计。俄国社会主义革命胜利对殖民地解放运动的发展是有决定性的作用的。苏联社会主义建设成功，战胜法西斯和日本军国主义以及率先拥护主权完整和所有人民一律平等——这些都使苏联精神上的领导获得扩大的影响。而且，在各个殖民地，事实上今天有数百万人民，他们已有数年反对殖民地统治者和民族叛徒武装斗争的经验。他们知道为什么战斗，他们也知道如何战斗。
    其次仍然有点混乱的问题就是：我们是不是还将争取和平的斗争作为我们的中心工作；而且两个制度和平共处在我们的纲领和远景里是不是还是重点？
    我们必须认识清楚马克思主义者所了解的和平斗争并不是说承认目前世界现况，并不是说拖延争取社会主义的斗争。我们争取和平的观念决不是这样的，马克思主义者的观念也不是这样的。因为，这种观念等于接受奴役来买得和平。
    事实上，只有社会向前踏进，只有人民有权决定他们自己的命运，和平才得到保障。在任何其他情况之下，不可能取得和平。
    在人们当中，我们必须使他们认清一个不可否认的事实，就是说，解放了的人民是保卫世界和平最强大的力量；亚洲的解放，人民挣脱帝国主义的统治是亚洲和平最坚强的基础。在我们党内，我们必须加深我们党员的认识，就是说，在民族解放斗争中，我们不采取中立的立场，在争取社会主义斗争中，当然也是这样。基于这种认识才产生我们的和平政策。
                ★
    再讲一些一般群众工作的问题特别是关于统一战线的问题。我想我们应从承认我们是面对着许多困难开始。此后，在美国会继续不断的出现煽动战争歇斯底里亚的企图，以各种不同的方式恐吓广大的群众，特别是恐吓和平运动和我们的党。每天都有散发小册子和征集和平签名者被逮捕。在每一个州都有逮捕。过去数天内，在菲拉德菲亚州就有逮捕十八起。在阿拉巴玛等州也有同样情形。对我们党的进攻，不管是用“合法”的，不合法的，或是“超合法”的手段，都会一天比一天加强。
    数天之内，或数星期之内，蒙特法真有被通过的危险，我们当然应该警惕这种威胁。以后会有更多人被放逐（已有很多放逐的传审了）。而且，对所有罢工会有总的进攻。杜鲁门关于铁路罢工的声明仅仅是我们所料想到事实的一个例子。
    关于我们群众工作，我想强调第二件事。我们须要顽强地向悲观的和惊惶的情绪作斗争。这种情绪是由于过高估计敌人和过低估计美国人民所能做的和将要做的。
    对我们党的领导机关，这是一个考验。在这时期，领导上要将我们党推向行动，在未来的斗争中，加强信心，提高热情。
    这里我想谈一个中心问题。我们必须看到，在我们国内，现在战争所起的影响和上一次战争所起的影响不大相同。也可以说，和过去二次战争都不相同。在这次战争中美国所处的形势和过去的战争不同。在过去二次战争中，别的国家，别的人民在实际从事战争，而华尔街坐享其成，而吝啬地抛给美国人民一些面包屑。在过去二次战争中，是别的国家，不是美国，遭到巨大的经济损失，在这次战争中美国被迫在各方面，经济上、政治上、物质上……等等，都会遭到严重的损失。对美国说，这是一种新的情况。
    其次，美国的经济已经产生了偏向，而且随着战争经济一天天在我们全民经济中占了绝大部分，它将朝着那个方向继续发展。这种情形会产生许多新的问题。我想，即使在我们的队伍中，也有许多错误的观念，认为国内的情势会和上次大战时一样。当然，这是错误的，第二次世界大战的性质和美国站在反对希特勒的联合阵线里的事实都有助于减轻打击，制止华尔街对美国人民的进攻。毫无疑问，这次战争之帝国主义性，在国内，会产生对工人阶级和黑人全面进攻，其规模为我国从未见过。奴役亚洲人民的计划和奴役美国人民的计划将同时并行。
    对于扩大开来的群众工作，这些发展会创造一些客观条件，事实上朝鲜事件在人民之间的反应并没有看出对这次战争“热烈的支援”。为什么美国要在朝鲜作战？对这个问题，有许多怀疑和犹豫。在国内，对原子战争的恐惧一天天加大，而事实也正是这样，这些情况创造了扩大我们活动的可能性。
    关于群众工作问题，直接对我们党要强调一些事情，乃是重要的。首先，我们必须强调，每一个共产党员和每一个党小组都必须发挥个人和小组的主动性。要有在群众面前明确我们立场的勇气，而不是将小部分人歇斯底里亚的反应当做广大群众真实的情绪。
    我们必须使我们党相信，无论在那种情况之下，必须应用统一战线的策略。决不能接受错误的观点，以为打击越大，困难越多，我们就要缩小我们的群众工作，缩小统一战线的活动。我们党不给工人阶级以领导，或者不围绕保卫群众利益的工作来展开统一战线的斗争，这种情况是不会有的。
                                ★
    具体地谈一些任务。首先，争取和平的斗争。这仍然是我们的中心问题。和平斗争中征集和平签名是重要问题。其所以特别重要，因为有些地区刚开始着手。我们党必须继续发动签名运动。
    当然，要说和平请愿是和平运动中唯一主要的活动，那是错误的。我们一方面继续这方面工作，在同样高度上，我们还要增加一些其他的活动。这些任务包括“不干涉朝鲜”，“美军从朝鲜撤退”等运动。这是非常重要的运动，我们必须设法发动起来，而且是可以发动起来的。
    有些人也许不支持“不干涉朝鲜”运动，但是会拥护别的问题。例如，许多人会积极支持人民中国出席联合国的要求。有些人相信朝鲜和台湾是两件事，会支持美国退出台湾的要求，并且拥护实现开罗和波茨坦决议的规定，将台湾还给中国。假使在全面朝鲜问题上不能推动他们的话，我们可以在这些方面推动他们。
    在和平签名运动中，我们必须及时注意建立和平组织——各种各样的和平委员会。将劳动和平大会建立成为真正群众性的团体是特殊重要的问题。
    随着当前发展，有必要调整党使它随时有准备可以紧急动员。我们要问我们自己，党是不是随时有准备迅速动员，譬如说，当一个重要的新的发展中，要求接触群众，在某一问题或另一问题上，要争取群众迅速行动时接到简短的通知，我们党是不是就可以立即组织千余露天群众大会？我们必须保证我们党的组织，当任何时候，发生特殊紧急的问题，有充分准备可以采取紧急动员。
    最后，我不认为我还必须强调我们党和我们领导在新情势下面临着真正严重任务。全世界工人阶级都注视着美国，比对任何其他国家都更注意地看着这里将要发生什么事情。这是可以了解的。我们所做的任何事情，不管多么轻微，在全世界都会发生反应，而其影响扩张到我国边境之外。在这个意义上，我们应该懂得我们的责任，我们必须冷静地看一看新的形势，新的困难；然而我们必须同样冷静地去看新的可能发展。一面固然是对我党的打击将会扩大，但是在反华尔街帝国主义的斗争中我们将赢得新的盟友。我们决不会不经过种种斗争而放弃我党任何一点合法地位，我们将赢得新的力量来反抗华尔街企图把我党非法化的攻势。
    同志们，在这个时候，任何悲观的情绪都是不该有的。世界资本主义是有理由应该悲观的。历史是在工人阶级的这一面——在为争取社会前进的力量的这一面。
