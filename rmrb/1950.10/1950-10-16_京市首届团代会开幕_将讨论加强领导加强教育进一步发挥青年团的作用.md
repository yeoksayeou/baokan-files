　　Beijing's First Municipal Congress of the Communist Youth League Opens
    Will Discuss Strengthening Leadership and Education
    Further Enhancing the Role of the Youth League
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The first congress of the Communist Youth League of Beijing solemnly opened on the 15th. The congress was attended by 341 delegates, representing 35,203 League members and 653 grassroots organizations.
    The congress began with an opening speech by Zhang Dazhong, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Work Committee of the Communist Youth League. He pointed out that the tasks of this congress are to summarize past work, determine the future work policy, elect members of the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and establish the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, etc., and proposed that this congress should achieve a high degree of intra-League democracy, and give play to the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. He said: In the past year and a half, the Beijing Municipal Communist Youth League has made great achievements in its work. The League has played an active role in completing the various tasks of the Party and the government, and has done a lot of work in the political and ideological education of young people. The League's organization has also made great progress. However, there are also shortcomings, mainly in that the leadership tends to issue general calls more often, with less specific assistance and inspection; more arrangements are made from top to bottom, with less research on the ideological demands and existing problems of the masses; and a relatively complete plan and sound system have not been established in propaganda and education work. Therefore, the main issues to be resolved by the congress are how to strengthen leadership, strengthen education, improve the level of branch work, continue to implement the basic tasks of the Party and government in various aspects, and further enhance the role of the League.
    At the meeting, Chai Zemin, Director of the Beijing Municipal Peasants' Association, Liang Keping, Minister of Propaganda of the Beijing Municipal Women's Federation, Xiao Ming, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Gu Qizong, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Student Federation, and representatives of the Beijing Branch of the China Democratic League, the Beijing Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, the Jiusan Society, and the Beijing Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, all spoke successively.
    At the meeting, more than ten units, including the People's Printing Factory and Tsinghua University, presented flags and gifts.
    Yang Bozheng, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Work Committee of the Communist Youth League, delivered a report to the congress on "Strengthening Leadership, Strengthening Education, and Further Enhancing the Role of the League" on behalf of the Municipal Work Committee of the Communist Youth League. This report will be discussed by the delegates in small groups on the 16th and then adopted at the congress. Finally, She Shiguan, Minister of Propaganda of the Municipal Work Committee of the Communist Youth League, will give a special report to the congress on the education of League members.
    The congress is expected to last four days and will close on the 18th. (Secretariat of the Beijing Municipal Congress of the Communist Youth League)

　　京市首届团代会开幕
    将讨论加强领导加强教育     
    进一步发挥青年团的作用
    【本报讯】青年团北京市第一届代表大会于十五日隆重开幕。参加大会的代表三百四十一人，代表三万五千二百零三个团员和六百五十三个基层组织。
    大会开始由团市工委副书记张大中致开幕词。他指出这次团代大会的任务是：总结过去工作，确定今后工作方针，选举团市委委员并成立青年团北京市委员会等，并提出这次大会要做到高度发扬团内民主，发挥批评与自我批评的精神。他说：一年半以来，北京市青年团工作上有很大成绩，团在完成党、政各项任务中发挥了积极作用，在青年政治思想教育方面做了许多工作，团的组织也有巨大的发展。但也有缺点，主要是领导上一般号召多，具体帮助、检查少，自上而下布置多，对群众思想要求和存在的问题研究少，在宣教工作上也没有建立起比较完整的计划和比较健全的制度。因此大会要解决的主要问题是如何加强领导、加强教育、提高支部工作水平，继续贯彻党、政各方面的基本任务，进一步发挥团的作用。
    会上，北京市农会主任柴泽民、市妇联宣传部长梁柯平、市总工会副主席萧明、市学联主席古奇踪和民主同盟北京支部、民主建国会北京分会、九三学社、国民党革命委员会北京分会等民主党派代表，均先后讲了话。
    会上有人民印刷厂、清华大学等十余单位献旗、献礼。
    团市工委副书记杨柏箴代表团市工委向大会作“加强领导，加强教育，进一步发挥团的作用”的报告。这个报告将由代表于十六日分小组进行讨论后，在大会通过。最后由团市工委宣传部长佘世光向大会作关于团员教育的专题报告。
    大会预计开四天，将于十八日闭幕。（京市团代大会秘书处）
