　　Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 15th: The Zhoni area, a Tibetan inhabited area in southern Gansu, has begun to implement regional autonomy. The Administrative Committee of the Autonomous Region, approved by the Northwest Military and Political Committee, was formally established on National Day. On the same day, a celebration meeting attended by thousands of people was held, and personnel from the Second Team of the Central People's Government Northwest Nationalities Visiting Delegation also came from afar to congratulate. At the meeting, Yang Fuxing, Director of the Administrative Committee, expressed heartfelt thanks to the visiting delegation on behalf of the local Tibetans. He called on the people of Zhoni to better unite under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government in the future, and work together with fraternal nationalities to build a new China and a new Zhoni. Ma Yuhuai, Deputy Leader of the visiting delegation, said in his speech: "After a year of efforts in various aspects, the social order in the Zhoni area has been basically stabilized, and the conditions for regional autonomy have been initially met. In the future, a Zhoni Autonomous Region People's Government with universal suffrage will be gradually established." Deputy Leader Ma pointed out: "The Kuomintang reactionary government did not allow the people of Zhoni to implement autonomy. However, in just one year after liberation, the autonomous region that the people of Zhoni had longed for was established. This proves that the thorough liberation of all nationalities can only be achieved under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government."
　　The meeting passed a telegram of salute to Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government.
　　It is reported that Zhoni is a part of the Amdo Tibetan area, located in the upper reaches of the Bailong River in southern Gansu, with a total area of ​​35,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 70,000.

The meeting passed a telegram to Chairman Mao, which stated: "During the rule of the reactionaries, we Dongxiang Hui people (referring to Hui people who speak Mongolian) were a nation that was despised, insulted, and唾骂. Our lives were extremely poor. After liberation, we ended our past painful lives. Chairman Mao, we especially thank you! Because of your wise leadership, a correct national policy was formulated, enabling us to implement regional autonomy. This was something we never dreamed of in the past. In the future, we will always follow you! Because you are the great savior of our Dongxiang Hui people!"

　　甘肃藏民聚居的卓尼地区
    开始实行区域自治
    临夏分区洮河西岸回民聚居区东乡自治区人民政府宣告成立
    【新华社兰州十五日电】甘肃南部藏民聚居的卓尼地区开始实行区域自治。该自治区行政委员会已经西北军政委员会批准，于国庆节正式成立。当日并举行了数千人的庆祝大会，中央人民政府西北各民族访问团第二队的人员亦远道前来祝贺。会上行政委员会主任杨复兴代表该地藏民对访问团表示衷心的感谢。他号召卓尼人民今后要在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，更好地团结起来，和兄弟民族一道为建设新中国、新卓尼而努力。访问团马玉槐副团长在讲话中说：“卓尼地区经过一年来各方面的努力，社会秩序已基本安定，初步具备了区域自治的条件，将来还要逐步地建立普遍选举的卓尼自治区人民政府。”马副团长指出：“国民党反动政府不允许卓尼人民实行自治。但在解放后仅仅一年时间，卓尼人民所渴望的自治区就成立了，这证明了只有在毛主席和中央人民政府的正确领导下，各民族的彻底解放才能实现。”
    大会通过了向毛主席及中央人民政府致敬电文。
    按卓尼为安多藏区的一部分，在甘肃南部的白龙江上游，全区面积三万五千平方公里，人口约七万余。
    【新华社西安十五日电】临夏讯：甘肃临夏分区洮河西岸七万回民聚居的东乡自治区人民政府，已于九月二十五日成立，同时举行庆祝大会。西北军政委员会民族事务委员会、甘肃省人民政府、中国共产党甘肃省委会、临夏分区专员公署、中国共产党临夏地委会等机关均派代表参加大会。大会通过了致毛主席的电文，内称：“在反动派统治时期，我们东乡族回民（按为说蒙古话的回民）是被轻视、侮辱与唾骂的民族，生活极其贫困；解放以后，我们就结束了过去痛苦的生活。毛主席，我们特别感谢你！由于你的英明领导，制订了正确的民族政策，使我们能够实行区域自治，这是过去做梦也想不到的事情。今后我们要永远跟着你走！因为你是我们东乡族回民的大救星！”
