　　U.S. Military Aid Arrives in Saigon
    Attempting to Prevent the Victorious Offensive of the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army
    [Xinhua News Agency] The great victories achieved by the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army between Gaoping and Lang Son in northern Vietnam have greatly alarmed U.S. imperialism. Currently, it is hastily providing military aid to the defeated French forces. According to reports from the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse: Brigadier General Brink, head of the newly arrived U.S. military aid advisory group in Saigon, declared on the 11th that U.S. armaments would continue to be "expedited to the hard-pressed French forces." At present, American military aid is "steadily arriving in Vietnam." Four ships carrying U.S. military aid arrived in Saigon on the 10th, and another U.S. vessel carrying aircraft and other military equipment will arrive in the near future. As early as the beginning of September, the United States had already supplied the French forces in Vietnam with equipment for eight motorized battalions. However, these American weapons have failed to stop the victorious offensive of the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army.

　　美国军援物资运抵西贡
    妄图阻止越解放军胜利进攻
    【新华社讯】越南人民解放军在北越高平和谅山间获得的巨大胜利，使美帝国主义大为惊慌，目前它正匆匆以军火援助大败的法军。综合合众社与法新社消息：新近抵达西贡的美国军事援助顾问团团长白林克准将于十一日宣称：美国军火将继续“尽速地运给窘迫的法军”。目前，美国的军援物资正“源源运抵越南”。载运美国军援的四艘轮船已于十日抵达西贡，另一批装运飞机及其他军备的美轮亦将于短期内到达。早在九月上旬，美国已供给越南法军八个摩托化营的装备。然而，这些美国武器并没有能阻止越南人民解放军的胜利进攻。
