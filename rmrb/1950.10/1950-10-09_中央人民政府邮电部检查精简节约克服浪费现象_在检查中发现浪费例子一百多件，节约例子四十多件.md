　　The Central People's Government Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Inspects, Streamlines, Conserves, and Overcomes Wasteful Practices
    More Than 100 Instances of Waste and More Than 40 Instances of Thrift Discovered During Inspection
    [Our Newspaper] In the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' streamlining and conservation inspection, more than one hundred instances of waste were discovered, as well as more than forty instances of thrift, and more than fifty suggestions were put forward. Based on the specific circumstances of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications itself and the opinions put forward by various units, the purchase of equipment was made the focus of the inspection. The numerous wasteful phenomena in the purchase of various equipment items illustrate that the various units of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications lack sound systems and scientific management in their work. In order to correct these shortcomings, in addition to strengthening the procurement and management system for equipment at present, it is planned to convene a national supply meeting in early November this year to solve various problems in this regard and establish a sound supply system.
    In addition to equipment waste, the abuse of official telegrams is also a very serious problem. According to the statistics for June of this year, the total number of free official telegrams nationwide was 4,267,774 words, accounting for more than 20% of the total business volume. Calculated at the price, this would require 8.2 billion RMB. There is also waste in the use of long-distance telephones. In January of this year, free long-distance calls nationwide accounted for 13% of the total business volume, and gradually increased thereafter. By June, the number of free calls had reached 21%. The needs of the business are certainly one reason for the increase in official calls, but the lack of economy in usage is the main reason. Some ordinary official matters that are neither time-sensitive nor important are also telegraphed, and the wording is not concise, generally using the format of official documents to draft the telegram.
    The increase in official telegrams and calls has resulted in congested circuits, hindering the transmission time of other telegrams and calls, affecting business revenue, and wasting manpower and materials. After this inspection, everyone's understanding has been enhanced, and there is a unanimous demand to streamline official telegrams. The Business Office of the Telecommunications Administration has formulated measures for the use of official telegrams and calls, and has issued a circular to all regions, bureaus, and other relevant units to strictly implement them.
    In addition, many wastes are also caused by the slow processing of official documents. For example, in June of this year, a batch of maintenance equipment was purchased from East China. The original value was 1 billion RMB, but due to the slowness of official documents, the payment was not remitted to Shanghai until July 11. At that time, Shanghai's prices were rising, and the result was that 1.8 billion RMB was spent. In response to this shortcoming, the Secretariat of the General Office has formulated trial measures for official document inspection, which will be strictly implemented from September 1 to prevent the recurrence of similar situations.
    In the streamlining and conservation inspection, many examples of conservation were also discovered: After the opening of the Beijing-Hankou carrier circuit, traffic was busy, and when all three circuits were fully open, telegraph services could not be cleared. If one circuit is used for telegraphs, the telephone traffic is not enough. Telephone and telegraph services are often contradictory. If one telephone circuit is converted into twelve telegraph circuits, it would be a waste because the country generally does not use twelve circuits, only three or four. Chen, the chief of the Long-Distance Group of the Technical Office of the Telecommunications Administration, improved the business based on the actual situation, cleared the telegraph circuits, and did not affect the telephone circuits.
    The Printing Office of the Telecommunications Administration has maintained a consumption rate of 0.2% for the past six months due to improved work efficiency. If calculated according to the general printing efficiency, which is mostly 1%, about eleven reams of paper have been saved in six months. The office also studied the reorganization and use of old wastewater lines, saving more than 14 million RMB.
    This streamlining and conservation inspection of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has discovered and solved many problems due to the personal responsibility of the leaders and the in-depth mobilization of the masses. The ministry also plans to make this movement one of the central tasks of the postal and telecommunications organizations in major administrative regions in the fourth quarter of this year.

### 中央人民政府邮电部检查精简节约克服浪费现象  在检查中发现浪费例子一百多件，节约例子四十多件

　　中央人民政府邮电部检查精简节约克服浪费现象
    在检查中发现浪费例子一百多件，节约例子四十多件
    【本报讯】中央人民政府邮电部在精简节约检查中，发现浪费的例子有一百多件，节约例子四十多件，并提出各项建议五十多件。根据邮电部本身具体情况和各单位提出的意见，把购买器材一项，作为检查的重点。从购买各种器材上的许多浪费现象，说明邮电部各单位在工作上，缺乏健全的制度，和科学的管理。为了纠正这些缺点，除在目前加强关于器材的采购，和管理制度外，准备于本年十一月初旬，召开全国供应会议，解决这方面的各种问题和建立健全的供应制度。
    除器材浪费之外，滥用公电也是一个很严重的问题。根据本年六月份的统计，全国免费公务电报计四、二六七、七七四字，占总业务百分之二十强，如按价计算，需人民币八十二亿元。还有长途电话使用，也有浪费。本年一月份全国长途电话免费占总业务百分之十三，以后逐渐增加，六月份免费次数，已达百分之二十一，业务上的需要，固然是公务报话增加的原因之一，但使用方面，不够节约，是其主要原因。有些既无时间性，又无重要性的一件普通公事，也用电报拍发，并且用字不简练，一般都用公文形式撰拟电稿。
    公务报话增加的结果，造成了电路拥挤，妨碍其他报话的传递时间，影响业务收入，和人力物力的浪费。经过这次的检查，大家提高了认识，一致要求精简公务电报，并由电信总局业务处定出公务报话使用办法。并已通令各地各局及其他相关单位严格执行。
    此外由于处理公文缓慢亦造成许多浪费。如本年六月间，向华东采购一批维护器材。原值十亿元，因公文缓慢，迟至七月十一日始把款汇到上海，那时适逢上海物价上涨，结果花了十八亿元。针对这个缺点，办公厅秘书处拟定了公文检查试行办法，九月一日实行严格执行公文检查，以防止类似情事的再度发生。
    在精简节约检查中，同时发现了很多节约的范例：京汉载波电路开通后，话务繁忙，至三路完全开放，报务无法疏通。如利用一路作报，话务又感不够，电话与电报业务常常是矛盾的，如果利用一路电话改为十二路电报，则因国内一般用不到十二路，只用三路四路，那样改便等于浪费。电信总局技术处长途组陈组长根据实际情况，改进了业务，疏通了电报电路而且不影响电话的电路。
    电信总局印刷室，由于工作效率提高，半年来始终保持了千分之二的消耗量。如按一般印刷效率，多为百分之一的消耗量，半年约节约十一令多纸。该室又研究将旧的废水线整理使用，节约了一千四百多万元。
    邮电部这次精简节约检查，由于首长亲自负责，深入发动群众，发现和解决了很多问题。该部并计划把这个运动作为各大行政区邮电机构本年度第四季中心工作之一。              （张白水）
