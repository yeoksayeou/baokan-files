　　Protesting the Government's Refusal to Reduce Prices
    Austrian Workers Hold Nationwide General Strike
    American and British Occupation Forces Attempt to Suppress the Strike Movement by Force
    [Xinhua News Agency, 7th] Following the large-scale demonstration by workers in Vienna, the capital, on September 26th, workers in various Austrian enterprises launched a nationwide general strike on the morning of the 4th to protest the government's increase in prices and unreasonable refusal of workers' demands.

    According to TASS and Dentsu news agency reports: The Austrian National Federation of Trade Unions' Council of Representatives meeting on the 2nd demanded that Austrian Prime Minister Figl reduce prices and immediately restore them to the pre-wage agreement levels, otherwise increase wages; and demanded guarantees that prices would not be increased again in the future, and that the Austrian schilling would not be devalued. Due to the unreasonable refusal of the Austrian cabinet meeting, workers in Vienna, the Austrian capital, took the lead in announcing a strike on the 3rd. Workers across the country also held a general strike simultaneously starting on the 4th.

    Seventy percent of workers in Vienna, the Austrian capital, have already gone on strike. Workers have flocked to the streets to demonstrate. Tram services in some parts of the city have been disrupted. The panicked Austrian government dispatched 25,000 fully armed police officers to seize factories, railway administration offices, and tram depots. The Austrian government also arrested thirty people on the 3rd and closed down the Austrian Communist Party's *Truth Daily* and the democratic newspaper *New Forward Weekly*.

    At the same time, throughout Austria, workers in all enterprises in provinces such as Lower Austria and Styria-Carinthia have gone on strike. The number of factories affected by the strike has reached 300. Railway traffic to Vienna has been suspended, except for one line that remains open.

    The Austrian government's rejection of the workers' reasonable demands and its various brutal actions are clearly supported by American and British imperialism in advance. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington: A US State Department spokesman publicly declared on the 3rd that Western occupying forces in Austria would use force to deal with the strike scheduled to be held in Vienna today. Subsequently, a London Foreign Office official stated on the 4th that if there were further strikes in Austria, the British occupying forces would assist the Austrian police.

　　抗议政府拒绝减低物价要求
    奥工人举行全国性大罢工
    美英占领军竟图以武力镇压罢工运动
    【新华社七日讯】奥地利各地企业工人，为抗议政府提高物价和无理拒绝工人的要求，继九月二十六日首都维也纳工人大示威之后，于四日晨举行了全国性大罢工。
    据塔斯社和电通社消息：奥地利全国各工会理事会代表会议，曾于二日要求奥总理费格尔减低物价，立即恢复工资协议前的物价水平，否则增加工资；并要求今后保证物价不再提高，奥国先令不再贬值。由于奥内阁会议的无理拒绝，奥京维也纳的工人，即于三日起领先宣布罢工。全国各地工人亦于四日起，同时举行总罢工。
    奥京维也纳百分之七十的工人已经罢了工。工人纷纷涌向街头示威。市内若干地区的电车亦已中断。惊慌失措的奥政府调出了二万五千名全副武装的警察，强占了各工厂、铁路管理局和电车厂。奥政府并于三日逮捕了三十人，封闭了奥共《真理报》和民主报纸《新前进周刊》。
    同时，全奥各地，如下奥地利省以及士的里亚——克伦地亚等省的一切企业中的工人，均已罢工。发生罢工的工厂，已达三百家。通往维也纳的铁路交通，除一路尚通外，其余一概因罢工停顿。
    奥政府拒绝工人合理要求和种种残暴行动，显系事先得到美英帝国主义的支持。据路透社华盛顿讯：美国务院发言人曾于三日公然宣称：西方驻奥占领军将以武力对付维也纳定于今日举行的罢工。接着伦敦外交部人士于四日称：如奥国再有罢工，英国占领军将协助奥国警察。
