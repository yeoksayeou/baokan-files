Xinhua News Agency Report: The Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, in view of the inconsistencies in the tax objects, applicable tax rates, and tax collection procedures in various regions regarding the taxation of the fishing industry, has issued the "Several Regulations on the Payment of Industrial and Commercial Tax and Goods Tax for the Fishing Industry" to take care of the livelihood of fishermen and to unify the taxation methods in various regions, as follows:

I. Industrial and Commercial Tax Section

	1. Fishermen who sell their own products and hold certificates from local village governments or above are exempt from business tax and income tax.

	2. Aquatic product companies or those engaged in the fishing industry with fixed organizations (such as the fishing vessel industry) shall pay business tax at a rate of 1% and income tax as general industrial and commercial businesses.

	3. Fish shops, fishery cooperatives, fish markets, fish stores, and fishmongers who specialize in purchasing products from fishermen for resale and profit shall be taxed at a rate of 2.5% for business tax and income tax as general industrial and commercial businesses.

	For the aforementioned fish shops and fish markets, those only acting as agents for buying and selling and charging handling fees shall be taxed at a rate of 6% based on their operating income.

	4. Street vendors regularly engaged in the fish business shall be taxed according to the measures for street vendor business license tax. Those with a larger scale may also adopt the method of periodic fixed amounts for collection.

II. Goods Tax Section

	1. The goods tax on aquatic products shall be levied in accordance with the tax rates stipulated in the "Provisional Regulations on Goods Tax," and shall not be levied repeatedly, nor shall any other taxes be added to the goods tax in any name; nor shall the methods of pre-collection or contracted collection be adopted.

	2. The goods tax on aquatic products shall be paid by the shops in the production area or by the purchasing and transporting merchants who purchase directly from the fishermen. Those that have not been taxed in the production area shall be paid by the market shops in the sales area, but the tax shall not be deducted from the price that the fishermen should receive. The tax authorities shall also not collect goods tax from fishermen or force fishermen to return to their place of residence to pay taxes first.

	The same shall apply to fish that are directly pickled or dried by fishermen.

	3. If aquatic product companies have processing plants that directly process and manufacture self-caught aquatic products, the tax authorities may send personnel to the factory to collect taxes.

	4. Small and scattered transactions of aquatic products in rural areas and those carrying burdens on their shoulders are exempt from goods tax.

　　中央人民政府财政部发布
    鱼业交纳工商业税货物税的几项规定
    【新华社讯】中央人民政府财政部鉴于各地在对鱼业课税时，其课征对象、适用税率及稽征手续，多未能一致，为照顾渔民生活，并使各地课税办法统一起见，特发布“关于鱼业交纳工商业税及货物税的几项规定”如下：
  一、工商业税部分
    １、渔民销售自己产品，持有当地村政府以上之证明者，免征营业税及所得税。
    ２、水产公司或有固定组织经营渔捞业者（如渔轮业），按税率百分之一征营业税，按一般工商业征所得税。
    ３、专向渔民收购产品转售营利之鱼业行栈、鱼业合作社、鱼市场、鱼店及鱼贩，按税率百分之二点五课征营业税，按一般工商业课征所得税。
    前项鱼业行栈、鱼市场，只代买代卖、收取手续费者，则按其营业收益额依税率百分之六课征。
    ４、经常经营鱼业之摊贩，按摊贩营业牌照税办法计征。规模较大者，亦可采用定期定额方法征收之。
  二、货物税部分
    １、水产品货物税，应依照“货物税暂行条例”规定税率征收，不得重征，或以任何名义在货物税上附加其他税捐；亦不得采预征或包征办法。
    ２、水产品货物税，应由产区之行栈，或由径向渔民购买之购运商交纳。其在产区未经纳税者，应由销区之市场行栈交纳，但不得在渔民应得之价款内扣除税款。税务机关亦不得向渔民征收货物税或强令渔民先返回住地纳税。
    渔民直接腌制或干制之鱼类，亦照前项规定办理。
    ３、水产公司设有加工厂所，以自捞水产品直接加工制造者，税务机关得派员驻厂征收。
    ４、农村水产品零星交易及肩挑负贩者，免纳货物税。
