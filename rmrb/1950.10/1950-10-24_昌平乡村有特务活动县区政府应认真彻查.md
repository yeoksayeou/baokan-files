　　Changping Villages Have Espionage Activities County and District Governments Should Seriously Investigate
To the Editor:
　　There are espionage activities in Dongyingfang Village, Changping County. They release poisonous smoke into residents' houses at night to make people dizzy. When the village militia captured a spy, they handed him over to the district. But the district said the village was spreading rumors. Later, the same thing happened in other villages. Recently, an old woman with a southern accent in her forties was asking questions in Yingfang Village. When asked what she was doing, she pretended to be stupid. Later, the village chief asked her, and she told the truth. There were five women who were investigating the situation in various villages during the day and meeting in the northern mountain gully at night. When the district government found out, they took the village chief and the old woman to the district. But for some reason, they released the old woman and detained the village chief. The People's Government cares most about the people, how can they be so inattentive? The men and women in our village are very scared at night now. It won't work if it goes on like this. Because the people in the countryside work during the day and cannot sleep and rest at night, this is a big problem. I hope the government will pay attention to solving it as soon as possible.

To the Editor:
　　I am from the Sixth District of Changping County, Hebei. On October 2nd, when I returned home, I heard the people say that there were "White Hairs" causing trouble in the countryside. Some people were wearing fur coats inside out, specializing in cutting off the nipples of pregnant women and the genitals of boys. On the 13th, when I returned home again, I heard many villages talking about this kind of thing. Recently, a village caught a suspicious person and the masses sent him to the district government. The district chief said to the masses: "Hand the person over to us, you can go back." But in less than three hours, this person was released. This kind of sabotage is very organized. They spend money to hire people, giving each person 20,000 yuan per day, to disrupt and sabotage rural social order. The People's Government should quickly stop it.

　　昌平乡村有特务活动县区政府应认真彻查编辑同志：
    我们昌平县东营坊村里，现有特务活动。他们在夜间向居民屋内放毒烟，熏晕人。村中武装捕到特务时，曾交到区里。但区里说村里造谣生事。以后各村都有同样事情发生。最近营坊村有一个南方口音四十岁的老太婆在村里问这问那。问她作什么，她装傻。以后村长问她，她才说了实话。她们有五个妇女，白天在各村探听情况，夜间到北山沟里会合。区政府知道了，把村长和那个老太婆带到区里。但是不知道为什么把那老太婆放了，倒把村长扣了起来。人民政府最关心人民，怎么这样不注意呢？我们村里男女现在夜里很害怕。老是这样就不行了。因为乡间的人民白天劳动，夜间不能安眠休息，这是一个大问题。我希望政府赶快注意解决。
        昌平县东营坊村村民编辑同志：
    我是河北昌平县六区人。十月二日我回家听到老百姓说，乡间闹“白毛子”，有人反穿皮袄，专门割取孕妇乳头和男孩子的生殖器。十三日，我又回家，听到好多村子也都在讲这类事。最近某村抓着一个可疑分子，群众把他送到区政府。区长对群众说：“人交我们，你们回去吧。”但不到三小时，这人却被释放出来了。这种破坏活动，很有组织，他们花钱雇人，每人每天给两万元，叫他们四出捣乱，破坏农村社会秩序，应请人民政府迅速制止。    木也
