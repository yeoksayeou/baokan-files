　　Rectification Movement Deepens at the Grassroots Level
    Rectification of District and Township Cadres to be Fully Unfolded
    [Report from this newspaper] The rectification movement for cadres below the district level in various regions is about to be fully unfolded. In East China, Central South, and Northwest China, the rectification of district and township cadres began in July and August due to preparations for land reform. The main method used was phased rotational training, combined with the study of land reform policies. In North China and other regions, the rectification of township cadres is being piloted in key villages and will be fully unfolded next month. In terms of rectification methods, in addition to centralized rotational training, some regions are using rectification meetings, expanded cadre meetings, and people's representative meetings to examine cadre work styles.
    The content of the rectification for district, township (village) cadres generally focuses on overcoming commandism, establishing a policy perspective, a people-serving perspective, and learning the working methods of the mass line. A few places also focus on examining retirement thoughts or agricultural socialist thoughts. The commandist work style is widespread and serious in various regions, and has to some extent created a situation of opposition between the Party, the government, and the masses in some areas. After this rectification study, some cadres have changed their understanding. For example, the saying "If the higher-ups want to complete the task, what can be done without coercion and command?" violates the mass perspective, which also violates the Party's policies. Some people say, "I didn't understand what policy was before, I just did things according to my own ideas. I dare not mess around in the future, I must act according to policy." "I must consult with the masses when handling things in the future."
    Adopt Effective Methods for Rectification Based on the Characteristics of District and Township Cadres
    Most rectification leading organs are able to grasp the characteristics of district and township (village) cadres in the rectification of cadres below the district level: their cultural, policy, and theoretical level is low, and the leading organs bear a large part of the responsibility for their past mistakes in their work. Because the leading organs have not provided enough education and assistance to them in the past, many people do not yet deeply understand policies and do not know how to use the working methods of the mass line. Therefore, coercive and commanding behaviors often occur in their work. Therefore, the following methods are generally used for the rectification of district and township (village) cadres:
    (1) Do a good job of preparation to dispel ideological concerns. Generally, district and township cadres do not easily understand the significance of rectification at once, and everyone has their own ideas. Some people think that they have made mistakes in the past, so being transferred for training means "being rectified"! Some want to take the opportunity of rectification to rest; some are afraid of being punished; some are afraid of being questioned about their private affairs; some are afraid of delaying their own production; some are unwilling to go because of difficult family life. Therefore, before the rectification, it is necessary to fully and deeply carry out mobilization work and repeatedly explain the purpose and significance of this rectification. Difficulties must be helped to resolve. Jiangning County in Southern Jiangsu deployed to various districts half a month before the centralized training, and conducted in-depth ideological mobilization. It helped trainees solve their family production difficulties as much as possible. After centralization, organizations and various necessary systems were established, and attention was paid to dispelling various ideological concerns, and the learning enthusiasm of the trainees quickly stabilized. In Minhou County, Fujian, because ideological mobilization work was not done well in advance, the township chairman of Qingpu Village was so frightened that he did not dare to come back for several days. Some township cadres in the Third District even resigned. Of course, the ideological concerns of district and township cadres about rectification cannot be completely eliminated at once, and education work must be continuously carried out during the rectification.
    (2) Strengthen the education of policy viewpoints and the mass line positively and actively. The specific method is for leading cadres to make special reports based on the spirit of several relevant documents combined with typical examples in actual work, and to mobilize everyone to discuss them repeatedly. It is not possible to require reading documents as with cadres above the county level. For example, in Changshu, Southern Jiangsu, the county party committee made special reports such as "How to be a Good Cadre" and "How to Serve the People", and Zhenjiang made a report on "Adhering to the Mass Line and Opposing Commandism". In the report, it is necessary to analyze the situation, find out the reasons and the harm to the people's cause, so that district and township (village) cadres can realize from their own experiences what is right and what is wrong, what should be promoted, and what should be opposed, thereby improving the ideological level and political level of cadres. However, some areas do not start with positive education in the training class, but only focus on exposing mistakes and settling accounts for "how many people were beaten" and "how many times were embezzled", so that cadres lack confidence in overcoming shortcomings when discussing ways to improve their work. They said: "Shortcomings can be changed, but with so many shortcomings, how should we do our work?" "The mass line is good, but how to follow it?" Some areas even use crude methods to carry out rectification. For example, in Yongcheng, Northern Anhui, the initial training class forced people to confess and struggle, and only allowed people to give opinions and not to defend themselves, forcing a township cadre to go three days without eating and even think of suicide. Generally, cadres believe that "they have worked hard, but the result is a mess." This approach not only fails to improve the ideological and political level of cadres, but also makes cadres lose confidence in their work and lowers their work enthusiasm, which affects their work.
    Some individual areas also rigidly apply the methods of rectifying county-level cadres, asking township cadres to "read documents" or using large-class methods to explain documents from a conceptual point of view, which did not solve any problems. For example, in the rectification of district and township cadres in Nanchang County, Jiangxi, they first read documents, talked about the situation, starting from the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan and the three-year War of Liberation, and then asked everyone to discuss it, but very few people spoke; even if they spoke, they did not touch the edge.
    (3) When district and township cadres conduct work inspection during rectification, they should also inspect and summarize the main work. However, because district and township cadres are generally not good at analyzing the situation and summarizing experience, they easily regard work inspection as settling old scores. Therefore, leading cadres must conduct specific leadership, personally help inspect the work, and focus on citing good and bad examples for analysis and comparison to clarify right and wrong, recognize various problems in their work, find the reasons, and determine methods for improving the work. In the first training class of Shaoxing County, Zhejiang, the work of pest control was summarized in the summary and inspection work. Two examples were compared: After Lingxia Township, Jinhua District, received the pest control notice, although the government had purchased kerosene for each village in advance and distributed it to each village to light lamps and catch moths. However, because no persuasion and mobilization were carried out, the masses were superstitious about skyworms, and the more they caught, the more they complained that the people's government was causing trouble and meddling in their affairs, so no one went to catch insects. Because the Liduzhen government of Lidu District carried out pest control propaganda to the masses in advance, and then mobilized the literacy classes in two villages with a better working foundation to go to the fields to catch insects, and showed the insects they caught to the masses for a visit, and calculated the losses caused by insect pests in detail for the masses to see, so that the masses realized the harm of insects ideologically. The next day, more than 200 people went to the fields to catch insects. The villages also launched insect-catching work one after another. The leading organs of the town convened a village cadre meeting in a timely manner to introduce experience and launch an insect-catching competition. On the third day, more than 1,000 people were mobilized to go to the fields to catch insects. Pine wood lamps were lit everywhere in the villages to lure moths. This enabled cadres to clearly realize that only by repeatedly mobilizing education and enlightening the masses to be conscious can the work be done well. In addition, some areas inappropriately used the method of inspecting personal life for the rectification of district and township cadres. For example, in the rectification of the third district of Shangyou, Jiangxi, the township chief of Youshi Township reviewed his Kuomintang style: he had whored with a woman, gambled ten times, embezzled two bolts of cloth, etc. Everyone proposed to dismiss him; then everyone reflected on themselves again, and as a result, the problem of the entire work style was not properly resolved.
    (4) It is necessary to focus on solving the most important problems at present. Because the level of district and township cadres is low and the training time is short, it is impossible to ask them to solve all problems in one rectification. Generally, areas focus on solving the most important problem of commandism at present. Some areas have special problems with generality among district and village cadres, which can also be solved in the rectification. Some individual areas did not grasp this principle, and blindly launched inspections, enumerated many contents, and exposed many problems, including problems that have been solved or have not been solved. The confusion made it impossible to solve any problems. This was the case in Jiangshan County, Zhejiang. Therefore, the most serious problem of commandism has not been resolved.
    (5) Strengthening specific leadership is the key to the success or failure of the rectification of district and township cadres. Because the rectification of district and township cadres is mainly based on positive education. Therefore, county party committee cadres must personally grasp it and prevent deviations from occurring at any time. Only with the personal leadership of cadres above the county party committee can some ideological and work style problems of district and township cadres be raised to the level of policy principles and given more effective education. District-level cadres in Hubei Province are trained by the prefectural party committee, and village cadres are directly led by the county party committee; Southern Jiangsu proposes that county party committee cadres who have participated in the rectification of the Southern Jiangsu Party School should lead the rectification. This ensures that the rectification of district and township (village) cadres can proceed in accordance with the central government's rectification policy.

　　各地整风运动深入基层
    区乡干部整风将全面展开
    【本报讯】各地区级以下干部的整风运动，即将全面展开。华东和中南、西北三大行政区因为准备土地改革，区、乡干部的整风七、八月即开始，主要采用分期轮训方法，并结合学习土改政策。华北等地区乡干部整风，正在进行重点村试验，下月亦将全面展开。整风方式上，除集中轮训外，也有部分地区采用整风会议，扩大干部会议和人民代表会检查干部作风等形式进行。
    各地区、乡（村）干部的整风内容，一般以克服命令主义、树立政策观点、为人民服务观点及学习群众路线的工作方法为主。也有少数地方检查退休思想或检查农业社会主义思想为主的。各地的强迫命令作风是普遍而严重的，曾经在某些地区在某种程度上造成党、政府与群众对立的现象。有一部分干部经过此次整风学习后，认识有了改变，例如，认为“上级要完成任务，不强迫命令怎么办？”这种说法，是违反群众观点也即是违反党的政策的，有些人说，“从前不懂什么是政策，只按着自己心思干。以后可不敢乱来，一定要按政策办事。”“以后办事一定要和群众商量。”
    根据区乡干部特点  采用有效方法整风
    多数地区的整风领导机关，在区以下干部整风中，能够掌握区、乡（村）干部的特点：即文化、政策、理论水平较低，而他们过去在工作中之所以犯错误，领导机关是要负很大一部分责任的。因为领导机关过去对他们教育和帮助不够，因此，许多人还不深刻了解政策，也不会使用群众路线的工作方法，在工作中，往往发生强迫命令的行为。所以对区乡（村）干部整风，一般采用了这样一些方法：
    （一）做好准备工作，解除思想顾虑。一般区、乡干部，对整风的意义不容易一下了解，各有各的想法，有的人认为过去自己有错误，既然调训就“挨整”去吧！有的想借整风机会休息一下；有的怕受处分；有的怕追问自己的私事，有的怕耽误自己生产；有的因家庭生活困难不愿去。因此，在整风以前，必须充分的深入的做动员工作，反复地说明这次整风的目的和意义。对于他们的困难，要帮助解决。苏南江宁县在集训半月前即布置各区，深入的进行了思想动员。对受训干部的家庭生产困难尽可能帮助他们解决。集中后，即建立组织与各种必要制度，注意解除各种思想顾虑，学员的学习情绪就很快稳定下来。福建闽侯县因事先未作好思想动员工作，把青圃村乡主席吓得几天不敢回来。三区有些乡干部并辞职不干。当然，区乡干部对整风的思想顾虑，不是一时可以完全消除的，必须在整风中不断地进行教育工作。
    （二）从正面积极地加强政策观点与群众路线的教育。具体方法是领导干部根据几个有关文件的精神结合实际工作中的典型事例作专题报告，并发动大家反复讨论。不能与县以上干部一样要求阅读文件。如苏南常熟由县委作“怎样做一个好干部”、“怎样为人民服务”等专题报告，镇江做“坚持群众路线，反对命令主义”的报告。在报告中必须分析情况，找出原因及其危害人民事业的情形，使区、乡（村）干部从自己亲身的经验中体会到什么是正确的，什么是错误的，什么东西应该提倡，什么东西应该反对，由此提高干部的思想水平与政治水平。可是有些地区的轮训班就不从正面教育着手，只着重揭发错误，清算“打了几个人”、“贪污几次”，以至干部在讨论改进工作办法时，缺乏对克服缺点的信心。他们说：“缺点可以改，但缺点这么多，究竟工作怎样做才对呢？”“群众路线好是好，但怎样走呢？”有的地区，甚至用粗暴的办法来进行整风，如皖北永城最初在训练班中硬追硬逼，动不动开会斗争，只许提意见，不许分辩，把一个乡干部逼得三天没有吃饭，甚至想自杀。一般干部则认为“辛辛苦苦干了一场，结果是一团糟”。这样作法，不但不能把干部的思想水平与政治水平提高一步，反而使干部丧失工作信心，工作情绪低落，影响了工作。
    也有个别地区硬搬县级干部整风的办法，叫乡干部“阅读文件”或用上大课方式，从概念上来讲解文件，结果都没有解决什么问题。如江西南昌县区乡干部整风，先读文件，谈形势，从八年抗战三年解放战争讲起，讲完叫大家讨论，结果发言的很少；即使发言，也摸不着边际。
    （三）区乡干部整风检查工作时，也应检查总结主要的工作。但因区、乡干部一般不善于分析情况，总结经验，容易把检查工作当成算老账。所以，必须由领导干部进行具体的领导，亲自帮助检查工作，并着重举出好坏事例加以分析对比，明确是非，认识自己工作的各种问题，并找到原因，定出改进工作的方法。浙江绍兴县在第一期训练班的总结检查工作中，总结了治虫工作，举这样两个例子作对比：进化区岭下乡接到治虫通知后，虽然政府事先为各村购了洋油，分给各村去点灯捕蛾。但因没有进行说服动员，群众迷信天虫，越捉越多，因此还埋怨人民政府好找麻烦多管闲事，所以就没人去捕虫。漓堵区漓堵镇政府因为事先向群众展开除虫宣传，以后又动员工作基础较好的两个村的识字班下田捉虫，将捉回的虫又给群众参观，又详细计算了因虫害而引起的损失给群众看，使群众从思想上认识了虫的害处，第二天就有二百多人下田捉虫。各村也就接二连三地开展了捉虫工作。该镇领导机关又及时召开村干会，介绍经验，发动捕虫竞赛。第三天，即推动了一千多人下田捕虫。各村普遍点起了松木柴灯诱蛾。这样使干部明确认识到：只有反复动员教育，启发群众自觉，才能把工作搞好。此外，部分地区，对区乡干部整风，不适当地采用了检查个人生活的方法，如江西上犹三区的整风，油石乡乡长检讨自己的国民党作风：嫖过一个女人，赌过十次钱，贪污过二匹布等等。大家提议将他撤职；接着每人又自己反省了一遍，结果整个工作作风问题并未得到适当的解决。
    （四）必须集中解决当前最主要的问题。因为区、乡干部水平低，训练时间又短，不能要求在一次整风中解决一切问题。一般地区都是集中解决当前最主要的命令主义作风问题，有的地区在区村干部中存在着带有一般性的特殊问题，也可以在整风中解决。个别地区因为没有掌握这一原则，盲目发动检查，平列许多内容，暴露出许多问题，已经解决的或尚未解决的问题都有，纠缠不清，什么问题都得不到解决，浙江江山县就是如此。因此最严重的命令主义作风问题并没有得到解决。
    （五）加强具体领导是区、乡干部整风成败的重要关键。因为区、乡干部的整风是以进行正面的教育为主。因此，县委干部要亲自掌握，随时防止偏向发生。只有县委以上干部亲自领导，才能把区、乡干部的一些思想作风问题，提高到政策原则的水平，给他们以更有效的教育。湖北省区级干部由地委训练，乡村干部由县委直接领导；苏南提出要参加过苏南党校整风的县委干部领导整风。这样作就保证了区乡（村）干部的整风可以按照着中央的整风方针前进。
