　　Some religious believers use a principled lack of "love of peace" as an excuse for failing to recognize the true face of imperialism. They worship American-style "democracy" and "freedom." If someone points out that the United States is imperialist, they think it is "not peaceful." This time, the U.S. imperialist act of aggression against Taiwan and Korea tore off their own masks of "peace" and "democracy," revealing the robber face of imperialism, and helping our people all over the world recognize that the United States is an imperialist country. For those who do not recognize that the United States is imperialist, we should strive to win them over, educate them, and help them clearly recognize that the United States is an imperialist country, and U.S. imperialists have committed heinous crimes against all mankind. They slaughter innocent people and suppress the people's movement for freedom and liberation. A country like the United States, an imperialist country, is precisely what we religious believers should resolutely oppose. In fact, the most resolute peace-loving religious believers in the world are the most resolute opponents of U.S. imperialism, such as Dr. Johnson, Deputy Dean of Canterbury in the United Kingdom, Mr. Wen Youzhang, Chairman of the Canadian World Peace Congress, and Mr. Wu Yaozong, the chief representative of religious circles in our CPPCC, are the best examples.

　　A very small number of religious believers, without principle, support and bless imperialism, willingly acting as lackeys of imperialism, like blessing Mussolini and the Fascist army, and the Catholic Pope who openly opposed the Soviet Union and communism, and Bishop Yu Bin, who made reactionary propaganda for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, etc. These are all scum among religious believers, and we should settle accounts with them.

　　Within Christianity, we must work harder to eliminate imperialist ideas within Christianity, especially the influence of U.S. imperialist ideas. We must be vigilant against imperialism, especially the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to use religion to cultivate reactionary forces.

　　However, the vast majority of religious believers are Chinese people with patriotic enthusiasm and a sense of justice. For them, we must widely and deeply launch a movement to defend world peace and oppose U.S. imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea, so that millions of Chinese Buddhist, Muslim, Catholic, and Christian believers can participate in this increasingly powerful world peace camp to oppose U.S. imperialist aggression.

　　We must clearly declare to the American religious circles and the American people: our opposition to American imperialism does not mean opposition to the American people. We must also call on the American religious circles and the American people to rise up and resolutely oppose Truman and MacArthur and other American warmongers' acts of aggression against Taiwan and Korea. The Northern Reformed Church of America, with 700,000 believers, has already passed a resolution on June 9th opposing the Truman government's huge military budget. We call on American religious circles and the American people to make broader protests against the Truman reactionary government, opposing them from sending American youth to MacArthur warmongers and the reactionary governments of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek as cannon fodder. I lived in the United States for nine years and I know that the American religious circles and the American people are resolutely in favor of peace and against war. Therefore, I believe that they will make stronger protests and demonstrations against the Truman reactionary government to oppose their warmongers.

　　美帝侵略台湾朝鲜宗教界坚决反对
    刘良模
    有少数的宗教信仰者以无原则的“爱好和平”作为他们认不清帝国主义真面目的借口。他们崇拜美国式的“民主”“自由”。如果有人指美国为帝国主义，他们就认为是“不和平”。美帝国主义这一次对台湾朝鲜的侵略行动，撕破了他们自己“和平”“民主”的假面具，现出了帝国主义的强盗面目，帮助我们全世界人民认清美国是一个帝国主义国家。对于那些认不清美国是帝国主义的人们，我们应该争取他们教育他们，帮助他们清楚的认识美国是一个帝国主义的国家，美帝国主义者对全人类犯了弥天大罪。他们屠杀无辜的人民，压迫人民争取自由解放的运动。像美国这样一个帝国主义的国家，正是我们宗教信仰者应该坚决反对的。事实上，全世界最坚决爱好和平的宗教信仰者，乃是最坚决反对美帝国主义的人，像英国坎特贝利副主教詹逊博士，加拿大世界和平大会主席的文幼章先生以及我们政协的宗教界首席代表吴耀宗先生等，都是最好的例子。
    有极少数的宗教信仰者，无原则的为帝国主义捧场、祝福，甘心情愿地做帝国主义的走狗，好像祝福墨索里尼、法西斯军队以及公开反苏反共的天主教教皇，替蒋匪帮作反动宣传的于斌主教等，这些都是宗教信徒中的害群之马，我们应该把他们清算。
    在基督教里面，我们更要努力肃清基督教内部的帝国主义思想。尤其是美帝国主义思想的影响。我们要警惕帝国主义，尤其是美帝国主义利用宗教培养反动力量的这一个阴谋。
    但是绝大多数的宗教信仰者是有爱国热诚、有正义感的中国人民，对于他们，我们要广泛与深入的展开保卫世界和平、反对美帝侵略台湾朝鲜的运动，使千千万万个中国佛教、回教、天主教、基督教的信徒都能参加这日益强大的世界和平阵营，来反对美帝国主义的侵略。
    我们要清楚地对美国宗教界与美国人民声明：我们反对美国帝国主义，并不就是反对美国人民。我们更要号召美国的宗教界与美国人民起来，坚决反对杜鲁门与麦克阿瑟等美国战争贩子们对台湾朝鲜的侵略行为。拥有七十万信徒的美国北方改正教会已经在六月九日决议反对杜鲁门政府的庞大军费预算。我们号召美国宗教界与人民对杜鲁门反动政府作更广大的抗议，反对他们把美国的青年送给麦克阿瑟战争贩子和李承晚、蒋介石反动政府当炮灰。我在美国侨居了九年，深知美国的宗教界与人民是坚决的拥护和平、反对战争的。所以我相信他们对杜鲁门反动政府，一定会作更强有力的抗议与示威，来反对他们的战争贩子们。
