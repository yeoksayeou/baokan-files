Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 6th: The large-scale autumn harvest in the five provinces of North China is nearing completion. Throughout the region, with the exception of some areas affected by waterlogging, hail, or insect pests, this year's autumn harvest has generally reached 80% on average, with an estimated grain output of 28.5 billion jin, reaching 91% of the total output before the War of Resistance Against Japan, exceeding last year's total output of 24 billion jin by more than 19%. Cotton output is approximately 6 million dan, reaching pre-war levels.

The bumper harvest has greatly encouraged the peasants. In the Pingyuan Anyang Special District, peasants had already purchased more than 200,000 pieces of autumn harvesting tools before the harvest. In Shan County, peasants repaired and purchased a total of 176 carts and nearly 6,000 agricultural implements, and bought more than 4,000 head of livestock in preparation for the autumn harvest. Women and children generally went to the fields. In general areas of Hebei, women participating in the autumn harvest accounted for 80% of the female labor force. In Jianping and Luan County, more than 70,000 women participated in activities such as cutting grain and picking cotton, freeing up a large number of male laborers to carry out the large-scale autumn harvest and autumn plowing. Women in Suiyuan, who had historically not participated in field production, also enthusiastically participated in the harvest under the encouragement of the bumper harvest. In Wudong County of the province, the number of participating women reached more than 80% of the female labor force with labor power, and drove a large number of children to the fields, achieving simultaneous harvesting and plowing.

After the peasants organized themselves, they achieved very significant results in the autumn harvest. In Pingyuan Shan County and other places, due to the widespread allocation of labor and mutual assistance, not only were the labor difficulties caused by the intertwining of autumn harvest, seed selection, pest control, and autumn plowing overcome, but also the autumn harvest was completed one-third faster than last year. In Suning County, Hebei, more than 1,390 labor mutual aid groups were restored and developed during the autumn harvest, and the efficiency was generally one-third faster than working alone. In the Chabei area of ​​Chahar Province, due to the widespread organization of labor mutual assistance and the assistance of a large number of women and children, the autumn crops in the entire region were harvested in just twenty days, avoiding wind, frost, and freezing disasters.

While carrying out the intense harvesting campaign, most villages in Hebei, Pingyuan and other places also carried out autumn plowing and autumn sowing. In Kangbao, Huailai and other five counties in Chahar Province, while organizing the harvest, they mobilized and organized more than 3,000 yokes of livestock to plow the land, and have now plowed more than 200,100 mu. The plowed land in Chabei accounts for 30% to 40% of the total autumn field area, and some even reach 70%. The sowing of winter wheat on more than 16 million mu in Shanxi is about to be completed.

　　华北五省秋收已近结束
    产粮达战前总产量百分之九十一棉花约产六百万担已达战前水平
    【新华社保定六日电】华北五省大规模的秋收已近结束。全区除少部遭水、雹、虫灾地区外，今年秋收平均一般达八成，约可产粮二百八十五亿斤，达抗战前总产量的百分之九十一，超过去年总产量二百四十亿斤的百分之十九强。棉花约产六百万担，已达战前水平。
    丰收给农民以极大鼓舞。平原安阳专区农民在收割之前即曾添购秋收用具二十余万件。单县农民为迎接秋收，共修购大车一百七十六辆，各种农具近六千件，购买牲畜四千余头。妇女儿童普遍下地。河北一般地区妇女参加秋收达妇女劳动力的百分之八十。建屏、滦县妇女七万余人参加割谷、摘花等，腾出大批男劳力进行大秋收割和秋耕。历来没有参加田间生产习惯的绥远妇女，在丰收鼓舞下，亦踊跃参加收割。该省武东县妇女参加人数竟达有劳动力妇女的百分之八十以上，并带动大批儿童下地，作到随割随耕。
    农民们组织起来后，在秋收中收到十分显著的效果。平原单县等地，由于普遍的拨工互助，不但克服了因秋收、选种、捕虫、秋耕等工作交织一起的劳力困难，且使秋收比去年节省了三分之一的时间。河北肃宁县秋收中恢复与发展起劳动互助组一千三百九十多个，效率一般比单干快三分之一。察哈尔省察北地区，由于普遍组织劳动互助和大批妇女、儿童协助，全区大秋作物在短短二十天内收割完毕，避免了遭受风、霜、冻灾。
    与进行紧张收割运动的同时，河北、平原等地大部村庄都进行了秋耕、秋种。察哈尔省康保、怀来等五县一边组织收割，一边动员与组织三千多犋牲口犁地，现已耕地二十万零一千余亩。察北已耕地占秋田总面积的百分之三十至四十，有些且达百分之七十。山西一千六百余万亩的冬麦播种已将完毕。
