Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 20th: The governments of the United States, Britain, and France previously sent notes with similar content to the Soviet government, groundlessly claiming that the People's Police of the German Democratic Republic did not perform ordinary police functions, but were a military force.

The Soviet government delivered replies to the aforementioned notes to the embassies of the United States, Britain, and France on October 19th.

The full text of the Soviet government's reply to the US government is as follows:

"The Soviet government has received the note from the government of the United States of America, which groundlessly claims that the People's Police of the German Democratic Republic do not perform ordinary police functions, but are a military force. The Soviet government firmly refutes this claim, considering it completely unfounded.

As early as 1945, the People's Police was established to perform ordinary police functions to defend public order. The measures to organize and arm the People's Police are fully in line with Directive No. 16 issued by the Allied Control Council on November 6, 1945. As is well known, according to this directive, the Control Council recognized the need for the German police to be "actively responsible for maintaining law and order," and, as required by the aforementioned directive, people with pro-fascist ideas were not and are not allowed to participate in the People's Police. The People's Police of the German Democratic Republic is now defending the democratic order established in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.

At the same time, the Soviet government reminds the US government that there are "police" forces (in fact, armies) in the western regions of Germany. The armament, organizational structure, and the training of its officers in specialized schools, the fact that this force is in fact receiving regular military training, and that it participates in military exercises with the occupying forces of Western countries, undoubtedly show that these forces are by no means intended to perform ordinary police functions.

The communiqué issued by the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France in New York on September 19 this year also proves this point. The communiqué stated that in addition to the existing police forces in West Germany, the establishment of so-called "mobile police forces" (in fact, armies) is also allowed, and it is stipulated that West Germany will participate in the "joint defense forces," in other words, it is openly stipulated to revive the German army, which runs counter to the Potsdam Conference's decision on the demilitarization of Germany.

From the above situation, it appears that the US government needs to fabricate groundless slanders about the People's Police of the German Democratic Republic in order to cover up the divisive measures and blatant illegal acts carried out by the US government together with the British and French governments in West Germany, such as the establishment of a German army (i.e., the so-called "mobile police force") and allowing West Germany to participate in the so-called "joint defense forces."

The Soviet government hereby declares that it will never tolerate the measures taken by the US, British, and French governments to restore the German regular army in West Germany."

The Soviet government also sent the same note to the governments of Britain and France.

### 美英法捏造关于德国人民警察的谰言  苏联政府照会三国严予驳斥  并指斥三国非法地建立西德侵略军

　　美英法捏造关于德国人民警察的谰言
    苏联政府照会三国严予驳斥
    并指斥三国非法地建立西德侵略军
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：美、英、法三国政府前曾分别以内容相似的照会致苏联政府，毫无根据地硬说德意志民主共和国的人民警察没有执行通常的警察职能，而是一种军事性质的部队。
    苏联政府已于十月十九日将对该项照会的复文分别送达美、英、法三国大使馆。
    苏联政府给美国政府的复文全文如下：
    “苏联政府已经接到了美利坚合众国政府的照会，照会中硬说德意志民主共和国的人民警察没有执行通常的警察职能，而是一种军事性质的部队。苏联政府坚决驳斥这种说法，认为这是完全没有根据的。
    早在一九四五年时，人民警察即已建立，其目的在于执行通常的警察职能以保卫公共秩序。组织并武装人民警察的措施，完全符合对德管制委员会一九四五年十一月六日所颁发的第十六号指令。如所周知，按照这个指令，该管制委员会承认有必要让德国警察“积极负责维护法律与秩序”，而且，正如上述指令所要求的，具有亲法西斯思想的人们，过去和现在都不准参加人民警察。德意志民主共和国的人民警察现在保卫着根据波茨坦协定而建立的民主秩序。
    同时，苏联政府提醒美国政府注意，在德国西部地区有“警察”部队（事实上就是军队）存在。这些部队的武装、组织机构、以及其军官之受专门学校的训练，此项部队事实上在受正规军的训练，且与西方各国占领军共同参加军事演习等事，都不容怀疑地说明，这些部队决非打算来担负通常的警察职能的。
    今年九月十九日美英法三国外长在纽约发表的公报，也证明了这一点。该公报称，除西德现有警察部队外，还容许建立所谓“机动警察部队”（实际上就是军队），并且规定西德参加“联合防务军”，换句话说，就是公开规定复活德国的军队，这是与波茨坦会议关于德国非军事化的决定背道而驰的。
    从上述情况看来，美国政府需要毫无理由地捏造关于德意志民主共和国人民警察的谰言，以求掩饰美国政府与英法政府一道在西德进行的分裂措施和明目张胆的不法行为，如建立德国军队（即所谓“机动警察部队”）和容许西德参加所谓“联合防务军”等。
    苏联政府兹特声明，它决不容忍美英法三国政府这种在西德恢复德国正规军队的措施。”
    苏联政府并以同样照会分致英法两国政府。
