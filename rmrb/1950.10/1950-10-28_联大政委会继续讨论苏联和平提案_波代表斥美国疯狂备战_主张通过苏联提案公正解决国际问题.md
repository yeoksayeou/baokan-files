Xinhua News Agency, New York, 27th: Comprehensive reports from TASS, the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee continued its discussion on October 25th of the Soviet proposal for a "Declaration on the Elimination of the Threat of a New War and the Strengthening of World Peace and Security".

　　The head of the Polish delegation, Mr. Wilblowski, spoke at the meeting. He first pointed out that the representatives of the US-UK bloc were attempting to drown out the Soviet proposal with a pile of lies and slanders, but the current international situation is too serious for us to follow this path. The war-mongers in the United States are unscrupulously clamoring for the launch of a war against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, therefore, the adoption of the Soviet proposal condemning propaganda for a new war is more urgent now than at any time in the past. Mr. Wilblowski reminded the Political Committee to pay attention to a map published in American newspapers that showed the Western countries' operational plan to seize Warsaw. Regarding the suggestion in the Soviet proposal to ban atomic weapons, he said: Only those countries that intend to use this barbaric weapon in future wars would oppose this suggestion. He then cited facts to prove that the United States is engaged in a frenzied arms race, thereby illustrating the necessity of the Soviet proposal to reduce the armaments of major powers by one-third.

　　Mr. Wilblowski concluded by pointing out: The declaration proposed by the Soviet delegation provides a fair and correct way to resolve the most significant and pressing international issues. The Polish delegation fully supports this declaration. If the United Nations adopts and implements this declaration, it will ease international tensions, mark the beginning of a new era of international cooperation, guide our organization along a new path, and ensure the completion of the tasks stipulated in the Charter.

　　Australian representative Spender, under the cover of anti-Soviet slander, expressed opposition to the various proposals in the Soviet proposal, but he had to admit that the Soviet proposal contained "ideas that no one here (referring to the UN General Assembly) can oppose."

　　The Bolivian representative opposed the Soviet proposal, but he said worriedly that rejecting the entire proposal would "contribute to Soviet propaganda."

　　The United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Mexico and Lebanon also jointly submitted a proposal opposing the Soviet peace declaration.

　　联大政委会继续讨论苏联和平提案
    波代表斥美国疯狂备战
    主张通过苏联提案公正解决国际问题
    【新华社二十七日讯】综合塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会十月二十五日继续讨论苏联所提“制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全宣言”案。
    波兰代表团团长威尔勃洛夫斯基在会上发言。他首先指出美英集团代表企图用一堆谎言和诽谤来淹没苏联的提案，但是目前国际局势太严重了，我们不能遵循这条道路。美国的战争贩子们正在肆无忌惮地叫嚣发动反对苏联和人民民主国家的战争，因此通过苏联提案中谴责新战争宣传的建议，目前比过去任何时期都更为刻不容缓。威尔勃洛夫斯基提醒所政治委员会注意美国报纸上刊载的一张地图，上面表明西方国家夺取华沙的作战计划。关于苏联提案中禁止原子武器的建议，他说：只有那些打算在将来战争中使用这种野蛮武器的国家，才会反对这个建议。他又列举事实证明美国正在进行疯狂的军备竞赛，从而说明苏联提案中建议裁减大国军备三分之一的必要性。
    威尔勃洛夫斯基最后指出：苏联代表团所提出的宣言，提供了公平和正确地解决最为重大和紧要的国际问题的办法，波兰代表团完全支持这个宣言。联合国如通过并实施这个宣言，就会缓和国际紧张局势，就标志着国际合作新时代的开始，就会引导我们的组织沿着新的道路进行，保证宪章中所规定的任务的完成。
    澳大利亚代表斯宾德在反苏诽谤的掩护下表示反对苏联提案中的各项建议，但是他也不得不承认苏联提案中含有“这里（指联大）无人能够反对的思想”。
    玻利维亚代表反对苏联的提案，但是他忧虑地说：拒绝整个提案就会“有助于苏联宣传。”
    美国、英国、法国、荷兰、墨西哥及黎巴嫩六国也联合提出反对苏联所提和平宣言的提案。
