    Seeing Chairman Mao in the City
    ——Farmers from the Outskirts of Beijing Participate in the National Day Parade
    Zhao Youfu, Wan Jia Ying, Zhu Jinyao
    On the early morning of October 1st, before the roosters even crowed, farmers from the outskirts of Beijing were getting up in the dark. Under the starry night sky, the farmers hurried to the capital to see Chairman Mao!
    At half past five in the morning, Gao Shuzhen, a female labor model from Nangong Village in the Eleventh District, along with her four mutual aid group members and four other farmer representatives, brought a sixteen-year-old child suffering from malaria and walked twenty-five *li* in one go to reach Nanyuan. They had just rested when more than 1,400 farmer representatives from villages dozens of *li* south of Nanyuan arrived. Song Yuting from Taihezhuang also limped along for more than thirty *li*. He said, "If it weren't for our People's Government and our Chairman Mao providing me with free medical treatment and distributing over ten *mu* of land to me, could I have turned over this year? It's worth it to be a little tired to see Chairman Mao, it makes me feel content!" Women and children squeezed into the ranks, wanting to see Chairman Mao together. Several old grandmothers over sixty years old from Wudian Village and Xinguancun Village shouted, "If we don't see Chairman Mao while we're this old, we won't get to see him in the future." Wu Xiu, a sixty-five-year-old man, had worked hard for many years, and only during land reform did he receive five *mu* and seven *fen* of good land and two tile-roofed houses. This autumn, he harvested enough grain to feed his family of two for more than a year. To see Chairman Mao, he said with a smiling face, "The first anniversary of the founding of the country is my first year of liberation. I must go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao!"
    The train carried the liberated male and female farmers to Yongdingmen, where they joined the farmer representatives from Ruihezhuang, who had come from forty *li* away and had been waiting since the eve of National Day, and entered Beijing City.
    The farmers'队伍 like a wave of wheat poured into the People's Square and passed through the avenue in front of Tiananmen Square. The loud and echoing voices of "Long Live Chairman Mao!" and "Long Live Farmer Comrades!" were truly unprecedented excitement for Chinese farmers in many years. The farmers stared intently at Chairman Mao, happily seeing Chairman Mao waving. The joyous and encouraging emotions became the climax of the farmers' year of liberation.
    On the way home, everyone was talking about this unforgettable day.
    Zuo Chengzhang, a newly liberated farmer in Nanyuan Town, said, "I am sixty-nine years old this year, and I am very happy to be able to see Chairman Mao today. In the future, I will be even more motivated to farm." Yu Jiangzhao, seventeen years old from Tuanhe, said, "In our village, every family had already prepared to go to Beijing! I planted five *mu* of wheat seven or eight days early, also to see Chairman Mao!" The farmers from Tuanhe and Shiba Lidian talked all the way about the People's Government providing loans, "666" pesticide, and wheat seeds to help everyone struggle out of hardship. Everyone said, "Having seen Chairman Mao, we must farm the land even better!"

　　进城看到了毛主席
    ——京郊农民国庆日参加游行示威
    赵有福、万家瀛、朱金耀
    十月一日大清早，鸡还没有叫，京郊远近的农民摸着黑起身了。在满天星星的夜空下，农民们赶着路要到京城里看毛主席啦！
    清晨五点半钟，十一区南宫村妇女劳动模范高淑贞和她的四个互助组员，另外四个农民代表，带着一个正在害疟疾的十六岁的孩子，便一气走了二十五里地，赶到了南苑。他们刚歇下，南苑南部几十里的各村农民代表一千四百多人都来了。太合庄的宋玉亭也跛着拐着赶了三十多里地。他说：“要不是咱人民政府、咱毛主席免费让我治病，又分给我十亩多地，这一年我还能翻身么？累点去看看毛主席，心里也称意呵！”妇女们、孩子们都挤在队伍中，要一起去看毛主席。庑店村、新官村的几个六十多岁的老大妈都嚷着：“我们这么大年纪，不早看看毛主席，今后就看不上了。”吴秀、一个六十五岁的老汉，扛了多少年的活，土改时才分到五亩七分好地和两间瓦房，今年秋天又打下了够两口人吃一年多的粮食，为了要去看毛主席，满面笑着说：“建国一周年，是我翻身第一年，我可得进京去看看毛主席呀！。”
    火车把翻身后的男女农民们载送到永定门，会合着国庆日前夕从四十里外赶来等候的瑞合庄农民代表，进了北京城。
    农民队伍像麦浪样的涌进了人民广场，经过了天安门前的大道。“毛主席万岁！”和“农民同志们万岁！”响亮而交相呼应的声音，真是中国农民多少年来从未有过的兴奋。农民们不眨眼的争看毛主席，欣慰地看到毛主席的招手。欢欣鼓舞的情绪成为农民们翻身一年来的高潮。
    回家的一路上，到处在谈论着难忘的这一天。
    南苑镇新翻身农民左成章说：“我今年六十九岁的人了，今天能看到毛主席，真是痛快极了，今后，种地的心情也更好了。”团河十七岁的于江照说：“我们村，家家早就准备好进京啦！我提早七八天种了五亩麦子，也是为了看毛主席哩！”团河和十八里店的农民一路上谈着人民政府贷款、贷“六六六”药水、贷麦种，帮助大家从灾苦中挣扎出来的事情，人人都说：看到了毛主席，越发要把地种好才行呵！”
