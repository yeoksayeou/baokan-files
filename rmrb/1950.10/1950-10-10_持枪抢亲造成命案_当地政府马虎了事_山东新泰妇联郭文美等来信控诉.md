　　Gunpoint Forced Marriage Leads to Death
    Local Government Handles Case Negligently
    A Letter of Accusation from Guo Wenmei and Others from the Shandong Xintai Women's Federation

To the Editor:
    A case of forced marriage leading to death has occurred here. The details are as follows:
    Kong, now twenty-two years old, was betrothed to the son of Xu Qindou in this village as a child bride due to her family's poverty. Xu's son joined the anti-Japanese war in 1944 (when he was only sixteen years old) and has not returned home for seven years (but communicates with his family frequently). Since Kong's fiancé joined the army, her mother-in-law often mistreated her, only asking her to work and not caring about her life. Therefore, she often returned to her parents' home to live. In January of this year, her mother-in-law told her that her husband had died in battle and asked her to find another partner, but Kong did not believe her and firmly refused. She said that her husband had not died, and it would be unfair to her fiancé who was fighting bloody battles to find another partner. Chai Chunqing from nearby Fuqiu Village attempted to seize her by force. On the one hand, he asked villager Xu Qinru to seek her mother-in-law's consent, and on the other hand, he set up a banquet to help the village cadres and militia. After careful planning, more than twenty militia members and young adults from Fuqiu Village ran to Kong's parents' home at night, opened the door, and entered the house with guns. Kong and her mother were confused (Kong was sick and had just taken medicine) and trembled with fear. The militia found Kong and dragged her away (they fired two shots into the air when leaving the village to show that they were not failing in their mission). But Kong resisted fiercely and rolled off the cart, refusing to go. The militia threatened her with execution and hit her on the head twice, tying her to the cart with a rope and pushing her back to Chai's house in Fuqiu, telling her to sit on the bed and forcing her to marry (according to local custom, sitting on the bed is equivalent to getting married). But she refused to sit on the bed, running out of the house several times but being dragged back. The people who forcibly married her had no choice but to pour more than an inch of water into the house, lock the door, and lock her inside. The village cadres and militia then opened a banquet and drank. At this time, Comrade Wang from the district grain depot, who was working there, learned of this news and went to the village under the pretext of finding the village cadres, eventually arriving at Chai's house. The village cadres were drinking. Comrade Wang asked what kind of wine they were drinking, but no one at the table answered. Kong, who was locked in the house, heard Comrade Wang's voice and shouted for help. Comrade Wang opened the door, and Kong told him about being forcibly taken away. Kong's illness became more serious due to shock and anger, and she died a month later despite medical treatment.
    After this incident, the district government only held one meeting, asking Chai Chunqing to make a self-criticism at the meeting. At the same time, no action was taken against the village cadres and militia who forcibly married her at gunpoint. Therefore, the masses generally expressed dissatisfaction with this issue. We suggest that the Xintai County People's Court investigate and handle this matter as soon as possible.

　　持枪抢亲造成命案
    当地政府马虎了事
    山东新泰妇联郭文美等来信控诉编者同志：
    这里发生了一件因抢亲造成人命的事件。事情的经过如下：
    孔氏现年二十二岁，因娘家很穷，从小即与本村徐芹斗的儿子订婚，当童养媳。徐的儿子于一九四四年参加抗战（当时他年仅十六岁），已有七年没有回家了（但经常与家庭通信）。自从孔氏的未婚夫参军后，她婆婆经常虐待她，只叫她干活不关心她的生活。因此，她经常回娘家去生活。今年一月间，她婆婆说她丈夫在战斗中牺牲了，叫她另找对象，但孔氏不信，坚决拒绝了。她说丈夫没死，若另找对象，实在对不起浴血抗战的未婚夫。附近浮邱村有个柴春青，企图霸占她，一面托村民徐芹儒征求她婆婆的同意，一面设席请村干民兵帮助。酝酿成熟后，浮邱村民兵及青壮年二十余人，在夜间跑到孔氏的娘家，将门打开后，持抢进屋。孔氏母女二人，莫明其妙（当时孔氏有病刚吃完了药），吓的浑身发抖。民兵找到孔氏后即把她拖走了（离庄时他们向空打了两枪，以不完成任务）。但孔氏坚决抵抗，滚下车来不愿走。民兵即以枪毙来威胁她，并在她头上打了两下，用绳子把她绑在小车子上推回浮邱柴家，叫她坐床，威逼她成婚（该地习俗如坐了床即等于结了婚）。可是她怎么也不肯坐床，从屋里跑出去数次均被拖回。抢亲的人没法，就在屋里倒上一寸多深的水，把门锁上，把她关在屋里。村干民兵即开筵喝酒。这时在该处工作的区粮库王同志知道了这个消息，即赴该村以找村干为名，直到柴家。村干正在喝酒。王同志问喝的什么酒，但席上的人没一个回答。被锁屋里的孔氏，听到王同志的说话声，即大声喊救命。王同志将门打开，孔氏即将被抢经过向他说了一遍。孔因受了惊吓和气恼，病势更加严重，药石无效，在一个月以后即死去了。
    这一事件发生后，区政府只召开了一次会议，叫柴春青在会上检讨了一下。同时对持枪抢亲的村干民兵也未进行处理。因此事后群众对这一问题普遍表示不满。建议新泰县人民法院从速调查，另行处理。
