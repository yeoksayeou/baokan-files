Xinhua News Agency, 11th: In light of the nationwide celebration of bumper harvests this autumn, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, in order to stabilize grain prices, stimulate trade between urban and rural areas, and prevent the continued expansion of the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products, has formulated a plan for the purchase of grain in the second half of this year, instructing the China Grain Company to purchase large quantities of grain in various regions. This plan has been implemented in various regions within the customs since the first of this month. The proportions of various grain types in the total planned purchase are as follows: wheat accounts for 15.86 percent, rice accounts for 55.15 percent, and coarse grains (including sorghum, corn, and beans) account for 28.99 percent. Based on the grain production, consumption, and surplus grain of farmers in various grain-producing areas across the country, the Ministry of Trade has also determined the proportion of the purchase volume in different regions to the total planned purchase as follows: North China accounts for 24.67 percent, East China accounts for 35.11 percent, Central South China accounts for 32.06 percent, Southwest China accounts for 6.47 percent, and Northwest China accounts for 1.69 percent. The main spirit of this purchase work is to stabilize grain prices and maintain them at a reasonable level to protect the interests of farmers. In the purchase, private merchants will also be united to participate, giving full play to the due positive role of private capital. To this end, the Ministry of Trade has specifically formulated the purchase and sales price difference and seasonal price difference for grain, so that transporters can obtain reasonable profits. The Ministry of Trade also instructs local grain companies to correctly grasp grain prices and make timely adjustments; when purchasing, attention should be paid to maintaining a reasonable ratio between cotton and grain prices to protect the interests of cotton farmers.
    In terms of purchasing methods, in addition to directly announcing listed prices for purchasing in grain distribution markets, local branches of the China Grain Company, in areas with cooperatives, will entrust cooperatives to purchase on their behalf at listed prices, and in some areas, private merchants will be entrusted to purchase at listed prices. While purchasing grain, both public and private businesses will fully prepare industrial products to go to the countryside to supply the needs of farmers, and promptly recover currency to avoid local price fluctuations.

　　稳定粮价防止工农业产品剪刀差扩大
    贸易部指示在各地大量购粮
    令各地正确掌握粮价并团结私商参加
    【新华社十一日讯】鉴于今秋全国普庆丰收，中央人民政府贸易部为了稳定粮价，活跃城乡贸易，防止工农业产品剪刀差额的继续扩大，特制定今年下半年度的收购粮食计划，指示中国粮食公司在各地大量收购粮食。该计划已自本月一日起在关内各地实施。各种粮种在计划收购总数中的比额为：小麦占百分之十五点八六，大米占百分之五十五点一五，粗粮（包括红粮、玉米及豆类）占百分之二十八点九九。贸易部根据全国各产粮区的粮产、消费及农民剩余的粮食情况，又确定不同地区的收购量占计划收购总量的比重如下：计华北区占百分之二十四点六七，华东区占百分之三十五点一一，中南区占百分之三十二点○六，西南区占百分之六点四七，西北区占百分之一点六九。此次收购工作的主要精神是稳定粮价，使其保持在合理水平上，以保障农民利益，在收购中并将团结私商参加，充分发挥私人资金应有的积极作用。为此贸易部特制定了粮食的购销差价和季节差价，使贩运者获得合理利润。贸易部并令各地粮食公司正确掌握粮价，及时吐吞；收购时注意坚持棉、粮的比价合理，以保护棉农利益。
    在收购方法上，各地中国粮食公司分支机构除了直接在粮食集散市场公布牌价收购外，在有合作社地区则由合作社按牌价代购，某些地区更委托私商按牌价收购。公私商业在收购粮食同时，均将充分准备工业品下乡，供给农民需要，及时回笼货币，以免发生局部物价波动。
