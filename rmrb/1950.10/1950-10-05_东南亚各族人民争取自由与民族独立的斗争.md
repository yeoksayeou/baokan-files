　　The struggle of the peoples of Southeast Asia against national and social oppression by imperialism, against colonial slavery, and for freedom and independence has developed in various countries of Southeast Asia.
　　For five years, the Vietnamese people have waged a heroic struggle against the French colonialists and their American instigators. Despite continuous new military reinforcements sent from France, and despite American military aid, the French expeditionary force has suffered defeat after defeat. The areas occupied by the French army do not exceed 10 percent of Vietnamese territory. In the other parts of the country, a new democratic system has been firmly established.
　　British imperialism has been waging a bandit-like war in Malaya for more than two years. However, neither the army (numbering 100,000, equipped with tanks and aircraft) nor the local special task forces have helped the Labor Party lackeys in London crush the will of the Malayan peoples of all ethnic groups who are struggling to liberate themselves from colonial shackles. The fragility of imperialism can be seen in the harsh laws recently issued in Malaya, which stipulate the death penalty for anyone participating in any action against military operations conducted by the British government.
　　The national liberation movement is also expanding in Burma. After British imperialism first trapped Burma with humiliating treaties and used every means to deprive the Burmese government of real power, it promised Burma "independence." However, although British imperialism bought off native feudal leaders, bureaucrats, and right-wing socialists, it could not deceive the people. The liberated areas of Burma hold half of the country's population, and in the rest of the country, workers' strikes raising political demands have not ceased, and farmers refuse to pay interest to moneylenders and refuse to pay heavy taxes to the government.
　　In Indonesia, the struggle for national independence continues unabated. In many areas, guerrillas are engaged in fierce battles with the Dutch colonial army. A powerful movement for freedom and for a truly independent and democratic republic is unfolding on the islands of Indonesia.
　　The success of the national liberation movements of the peoples of Southeast Asia is the result of a great awakening of their national consciousness. These successes are possible because of the historically significant victories of the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the international working-class movement throughout the world, and because of the general strengthening of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution has further inspired the peoples of all ethnic groups in Southeast Asia. They have seen in the Chinese revolution a living example of how to fight for national liberation and how this struggle, under the leadership of the Communist Party, has achieved such satisfactory results.
　　The success of the international democratic front has drastically changed the balance of power, favoring the camp of peace and democracy while weakening the imperialist camp, a fact that has decisively damaged the entire colonial system of imperialism.
　　American imperialism has openly declared its banditry aimed at world hegemony, and it has now become the constable and executioner of the peoples of all ethnic groups in Southeast Asia.
　　The foreign policy line of American imperialism is based on the incorrect assumption that it can quickly seize the countries of Southeast Asia and then, using their territories as a base, enslave the great Chinese people and the peoples of all ethnic groups throughout Asia. In order to contain the liberation movement of the peoples of Southeast Asia, American imperialism has turned from preparing for aggression to taking direct aggressive action.
　　However, the American intervention in Korea has met with the united and strong will of the Korean people to fight for national independence and freedom. The Korean Fatherland Unification Democratic Front, representing the Korean people, declared: "We do not need the 'freedom' of American blacks, a freedom that American imperialism has built on the bones of black people. Nor do we need the 'freedom' of the peoples of South America, where American imperialism, like a spider, sucks the blood of the peoples of South America bound by its colonial bonds, plunging them into extreme hunger, poverty, and lack of rights. Even less do we need the 'freedom' given to the South Korean people by the American occupation forces (with the support of the traitor Syngman Rhee), a 'freedom' that for the South Korean people means poverty, ignorance, and lack of rights. When American imperialism talks about the so-called 'freedom of the Korean people,' it only has in mind the freedom of American imperialism to accumulate wealth from the blood and sweat of the Korean people, while according to American imperialism's racial 'theory,' the Korean people are not regarded as human beings. We do not need such 'freedom.' What the Korean people need is genuine freedom without foreign imperialist interference."
　　This is the will of the heroic Korean people, and this will cannot be thwarted either by guns or artillery, or by the bestial bombing of peaceful villages and towns, or by the collective execution of Korean patriotic volunteers. The more cruel and violent American imperialism is, the greater the determination of struggle it arouses among the peoples of all ethnic groups who long for freedom and independence.
　　The American intervention in Korea has made clear to everyone the true intentions of Wall Street in Southeast Asia. That blood-drinking butcher MacArthur wants to turn Taiwan into a huge aircraft carrier, turn the Philippines into a submarine base, and turn the entire Pacific Ocean into an "American lake." The scale of this imperialist plan far exceeds that of the Japanese militarists. The American aggressors want to realize this plan with fire and sword, massacring tens of thousands of Korean women and children. They want to intimidate all freedom-loving peoples and threaten them with annihilation.
　　Therefore, the struggle for national liberation is an extremely necessary, sacred, and just cause for the peoples of all ethnic groups in Southeast Asia. Only armed resistance, only resolute armed struggle against foreign occupiers, against domestic reactionaries, and against those who betray the people can guarantee the national freedom and independence of the countries of Southeast Asia.
　　The great Chinese people have set an outstanding example of how to organize armed resistance against imperialist enslavers. Under the current circumstances, a successful national liberation movement can only be led by the working class and its vanguard—the Communist Party. Under the banner of the liberation struggle against brutal colonial rule and for in-depth democratic reforms, the working class unites all who cherish the freedom and independence of their motherland, especially the peasants. The slogan of land reform against feudal ownership is also an anti-imperialist slogan, because it can mobilize the power of the people against feudal leaders—the supporters of imperialism—and can mobilize millions of peasants who will receive not only national liberation but also social liberation.
　　American imperialism is mobilizing all the forces of world imperialism against the national liberation movement: British, French, and Dutch imperialism are acting as its lackeys as American imperialism implements its colonial policy. The peoples of all ethnic groups struggling for freedom and independence must deal with the well-equipped imperialist armies. However, the morale of these colonialist armies is low; they are mercenary armies, and their soldiers are fighting far from home for irrelevant interests, while at the same time, the peoples of all ethnic groups in Southeast Asia are fighting on their own land for their own vital interests. Their strength and invincible source lie here.
　　The strength and invincibility of the national liberation movement also lie in the fact that it is an inseparable part of the international movement to defend peace. The peoples of all ethnic groups in Southeast Asia want to decide their own destiny; they want peace.
　　The people of the whole world, including the American people, are firmly supporting the heroic Korean people and the peoples of all ethnic groups in Southeast Asia who are carrying out a just liberation struggle. This struggle of the peoples of all ethnic groups in Southeast Asia (who know they are right and who recognize their national responsibility), supported by the great moral support of all freedom-loving humanity, will achieve complete victory.

### 东南亚各族人民争取自由与民族独立的斗争

　　东南亚各族人民争取自由与民族独立的斗争
    各族人民反对帝国主义的民族与社会的压迫、反对殖民地奴役、争取自由与独立的尖锐与奋勇的斗争，已经在东南亚各国发展起来了。
    五年来，越南人民对法国殖民者和他们的美国指使者进行了英勇的斗争。虽然不断的有新的军事增援从法国派去，虽然有美国的军事援助，法国的远征军却一败再败。法国军队所占领的地区不超过越南领土的百分之十。在该国的其他部分，一种新民主的制度已经巩固地建立起来了。
    英帝国主义在马来亚进行土匪式的战争，已经有两年多了。可是，不论军队（有十万人之众，配备有坦克与飞机）也好，当地的特别讨伐部队也好，都没有帮助伦敦城的工党仆从们摧毁那为了从殖民地枷锁中解放出来而斗争着的马来亚各族人民的意志。帝国主义的脆弱可以从最近他们在马来亚发布的严酷法律中看出来，这一条法律规定，凡参加任何行动以反对英国政府所进行的军事行动的人都处以死刑。
    民族解放运动也在缅甸扩大着，英帝国主义先用难堪的条约使缅甸落入圈套中，并且用一切办法剥夺了缅甸政府的实权以后，它答应了缅甸“独立”。可是，虽然英帝国主义收买到了土著的封建首领、官僚与右翼的社会党人，却欺骗不了人民。缅甸的解放区拥有该国半数的人口，而在其余的地方，提出政治要求的工人罢工并没有停止过，农民则拒绝向高利贷者付利息，拒绝向政府缴纳重税。
    在印尼，争取民族独立的斗争不断地进行着。在好些地区，游击队跟荷兰的殖民军进行着激烈的战斗。在印尼的群岛上，正展开着一种争取自由、争取一个真正独立与民主的共和国的强有力的运动。
    东南亚各族人民的民族解放运动的成功，是他们的民族意识大大地觉醒起来了的结果。这些成功之所以可能，是由于苏联、人民民主国家以及国际工人阶级运动在全世界得到了有历史意义的胜利；是由于和平、民主与社会主义的阵营普遍的强化。中国人民革命的胜利又鼓舞了东南亚的各族人民，他们在中国革命中看到了一个怎样为争取民族解放而斗争的活生生的例子，他们看到了这种斗争在共产党领导之下得到了怎样美满的结果。
    国际民主阵线的成功已经使力量的对比起了剧烈的变化，有利于和平与民主阵营同时削弱了帝国主义阵营，这一事实有决定意义地损害了帝国主义的整个殖民制度。
    美帝国主义公然宣布了它的以争霸世界为目的的土匪行径，它现在已成为东南亚各族人民的宪兵和绞刑吏了。
    美帝国主义的外交政策路线是基于不正确的设想的，它以为它可以迅速地把东南亚各国抓在手里，然后，利用它们的领土为基地，就能够奴役伟大的中国人民以及整个亚洲的各族人民了。为了遏止东南亚各族人民的解放运动，美帝国主义从准备侵略转而采取直接侵略的行动。
    可是，美国对朝鲜的干涉碰到了朝鲜人民争取民族独立与自由的统一而坚强的意志。朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线，代表朝鲜人民宣称：“我们不需要美国黑人的‘自由’，那种自由是美帝国主义在黑人的骸骨上建立起来的。我们也不需要南美各族人民的‘自由’，美帝国主义像一只蜘蛛一样吸着在其殖民地束缚之下的南美各族人民的血液，使他们陷于极度的饥饿、贫困并且缺乏各种权利。我们更不需要美国占领军（在李承晚卖国贼的支持之下）给予南朝鲜人民的‘自由’，这种‘自由’对于南朝鲜人民就是贫穷、愚昧与缺乏各种权利。美帝国主义谈到所谓‘朝鲜人民的自由’的时候。它心目中只有美帝国主义的自由，它在朝鲜人的血汗上聚集财富，而按照美帝国主义的种族‘理论’，朝鲜人民是不被当作人看的。我们不需要这样的‘自由’。朝鲜人民需要的是没有外国帝国主义干涉的真正的自由。”
    这就是英勇的朝鲜人民的意志，而这种意志既不是用枪炮，也不是用兽性地轰炸和平村镇的办法，或者用集体枪毙朝鲜爱国志士的办法所能加以挫折的。美帝国主义愈残忍狂暴，它在渴望自由与独立的各族人民之间所引起的斗争决心也愈大。
    美国对朝鲜的干涉已经使大家看清楚了华尔街对东南亚的真正意图。那喝血的屠夫麦克阿瑟想把台湾变为一艘庞大的航空母舰，把菲律宾变为一个潜艇基地，并且把整个太平洋变成一个“美国湖”。这个帝国主义计划的规模远超过日本军阀们的计划。美国侵略者们想用火与剑来实现这个计划，屠杀成千成万的朝鲜妇女与儿童。他们要恫吓一切爱好自由的各族人民，拿消灭他们来进行威胁。
    因此，争取民族解放的斗争，对于东南亚各族人民来说，是一件极为必要的、神圣的正义的事业。只有武装抵抗，只有对外国占领者、对国内的反动派及出卖人民的人进行坚决的武装斗争才能保障东南亚各国的民族自由与独立。
    伟大的中国人民已经做出了一个出色的榜样，应该怎样来组织对帝国主义奴役者的武装抵抗。在目前情形之下，要进行成功的民族解放运动，只能由工人阶级及其先锋队——共产党来领导。在反对残暴的殖民地统治、争取深入的民主改革的解放斗争的旗帜之下，工人阶级团结着一切珍惜祖国之自由与独立的人，首先是农民。反对封建所有制的土地改革的口号，同时是一个反帝国主义的口号，因为它可以动员人民的力量来反对封建首领——帝国主义的拥护者，并且可以动员千百万不但得到民族解放而且得到社会解放的农民。
    美帝国主义正动员着世界帝国主义的一切力量来反对民族解放运动：英、法、荷帝国主义在美帝国主义实行其殖民政策时，充当它的小伙计。为争取自由与独立而斗争着的各族人民必须要对付那武装齐备的帝国主义军队。可是，这些殖民者的军队的士气是低的；他们是雇佣军队，他们的士兵远离家乡为着不相干的利益而作战、而同时，东南亚的各族人民是在本国的土地上为着他们切身的利益而战。他们的力量与无敌的泉源就在这里。
    民族解放运动的力量与无敌也在于，它是国际保卫和平运动的不可分的一部分。东南亚各族人民要自己决定他们的命运；他们要和平。
    全世界的人民，包括美国人民在内，是坚决支持进行着正义的解放斗争的英勇的朝鲜人民以及东南亚各族人民的。得到全体爱好自由的人类之巨大的道义上的支持的，东南亚各族人民（他们知道他们是对的，他们认识他们的民族责任）的这种斗争，将得到彻底的胜利。
