    Regarding the Issue of Soviet Power Generation Capacity
    Reply to Reader Wu Zuyao

    In the third paragraph of "International Week" in the October 8th issue of this newspaper, the statement "The total power generation capacity of the newly built hydroelectric power stations in the Soviet Union reaches 4.25 million kilowatts... While the United States increased its hydropower generation by only 2.46 billion kilowatt-hours between 1945 and 1948, which is equivalent to only one-quarter of the power generation of the Kuibyshev hydroelectric power station" is accurate. The former "kilowatt" mentioned in the article is a unit of electrical power, while the latter "kilowatt-hour" is a unit of electrical energy. The power generation capacity of the Kuibyshev hydroelectric power station is 2 million kilowatts, and its annual electricity production is 10 billion kilowatt-hours (see Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 13th dispatch, published in this newspaper on September 14th). Therefore, the increase in electricity generated by the United States between 1945 and 1948 is only a quarter of that station’s output.

　　关于苏联发电能力问题
    答读者吴祖耀问
    十月八日本报《国际一周》第三段中，“苏联新建的水电站发电能力的总和达四百二十五万千瓦。……而美国在一九四五年到一九四八年间，水力发电量不过增加了二十四亿六千万千瓦时，即相当于古比雪夫一个水电站发电量的四分之一。”无误。该文前者所说的“千瓦”为电力计算单位，后者所说的“千瓦时”为电量计算单位。古比雪夫水电站的发电能力为二百万千瓦，每年生产的电量为一百亿千瓦时（见新华社北京九月十三日电，载九月十四日本报），因此美国在一九四五年至一九四八年间增加的电量只及它的四分之一。
