    Closely Integrating with Work, Leaders Taking the Lead
    Beijing's Rectification Movement Fully Unfolds
    Current Focus is on Studying and Improving Work Methods
    [Our Newspaper's Report] Beijing's rectification movement, which began in early August, has now fully unfolded, with all units deeply examining and summarizing their work.

    Before the start of the rectification, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party formulated a rectification work plan based on the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. On August 15th, Comrade Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Municipal Committee, reported on the purpose, methods, and steps of the rectification at a meeting of party member and cadre representatives. After the meeting, all units began the rectification.

    The steps of the rectification movement are to read documents, then examine and summarize work. The examination of work first started with the leading organs such as the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC and the Municipal People's Government. The Municipal Committee convened seven forums in succession from the end of August to the beginning of September, gathering various departments, commissions, party groups, sub-party groups, and district committees. The Municipal Government also convened ten forums separately, gathering subordinate units. Now, the departments directly under the Municipal Committee and the Municipal Government are summarizing their work based on the decisions and implementation of various policies and guidelines, as well as the opinions raised in the forums. The units under the leadership of the Municipal Committee and the Municipal Government have also entered the stage of examining their work one after another, and some have made final summaries.

    Firmly grasping the rectification method of focusing on summarizing work is the basic link for the correct and in-depth development of the rectification movement. Before the start of the rectification movement, there were various ideological concerns among some cadres. Therefore, the Beijing Municipal Committee repeatedly emphasized: the main methods of this rectification movement are to study documents, summarize work, analyze situations, and develop criticism and self-criticism. The purpose of the rectification is to improve work, raise the ideological and political level of cadres and party members, and overcome bureaucracy and commandism, and not to dwell on personal life and other minor issues. Regarding the rectification of non-party cadres, the Municipal Committee also pointed out: Party and non-party cadres should be treated equally when summarizing work, but there should be distinctions when examining personal ideology and work style. The Municipal Government also convened a mobilization meeting of party and Youth League member cadres, where Secretary-General Xue Zizheng reported on the purpose and methods of the rectification. After the understanding of the rectification was corrected, the confidence of the general cadres was raised, and they were able to speak actively at the meetings for examining and summarizing work.

    Some units took detours in the rectification because they did not grasp the basic link of focusing on summarizing work. For example, in the rectification of the Municipal Government's Public Works Bureau, the leadership asked the subordinates to say whatever they wanted, without guiding everyone's opinions to summarizing work. As a result, a large part of the opinions raised were minor issues such as personal life, treatment, and work style. Therefore, the rectification movement could not be deepened and could not achieve the purpose of improving and raising work.

    Leaders being responsible and taking the lead is also an important key to deepening the rectification movement. After the start of this rectification, Comrade Peng Zhen personally presided over every forum convened by the Municipal Committee, humbly listened to opinions, answered questions, and reviewed the rectification plans of various units. Deputy Mayors Zhang Youyu and Wu Han of the Municipal Government also personally presided over rectification meetings. The cadres who participated in the forums unanimously believed that such meetings could solve problems well. The Municipal Government and the Municipal Public Security Bureau established rectification offices under the leadership of the Mayor and the Bureau Chief to strengthen the leadership of the rectification and sent cadres to go deep into the lower levels to understand the situation, ensuring the implementation and execution of the rectification plan.

    Grasping leadership, starting rectification with a plan, steps, and preparation, and preventing and correcting deviations in a timely manner so that the rectification movement can embark on the right track is also an important key to the rectification movement. The rectification plans and key points of examination and summary of work of various units were all started after being reviewed and approved by higher-level leading organs. The Health Bureau once stipulated that only cadres above the level of section chief could study documents; the Third District Office planned to carry out the summary of work and the ideological summary of general cadres in parallel at the same time. These deviations were discovered and corrected in the review of the rectification plans of various units.

    Beijing's rectification is carried out under the circumstances of concentrated urban leadership and busy work, so the method of carrying out rectification while adhering to work was adopted. For example, before the start of the rectification, the Commercial Bureau summarized the work of August and specifically arranged the work of September for its subordinate units, so that the work below would not be suspended due to the rectification of the leading organs. Some units did not pay enough attention to this. For example, when the Taxation Bureau was rectifying, it gathered the directors of various tax bureaus together for eight or nine days of meetings, and the work of some bureaus was affected.

    At present, in addition to continuing to expose and review the shortcomings and errors in the work, the focus of Beijing's rectification has shifted to studying methods and systems for improving work. This work is much more difficult and much more important than simply pointing out shortcomings and errors. This is the key to the current rectification stage in Beijing. (Xiao Jia)

　　密切结合工作首长亲自动手
    京市整风运动全面展开
    目前重点为研究改进工作办法
    【本报讯】北京市的整风运动，八月初开始，现已全面展开，各单位正深入检查总结工作。
    在整风开始前，中共北京市委会根据中共中央指示制订整风工作计划。八月十五日市委书记彭真同志在党员干部代表会议上报告了整风的目的、方法和步骤。会后各单位即开始整风。
    整风运动的步骤是阅读文件之后，即检查总结工作。检查工作先由中共市委会、市人民政府等领导机关开始。市委会在八月底至九月初曾连续召集各部、委，各党组、分党组，各区委，举行了七次座谈会。市政府亦分别召集所属各单位举行了十次座谈会。现在市委直属各部门和市政府正根据各种政策方针的决定与执行情况，以及座谈中所提的意见进行总结工作。市委市府领导下的各单位也已先后进入检查工作阶段，有的已做出最后总结。
    紧紧的掌握以总结工作为主的整风方法，是整风运动能够正确深入开展的基本环节。在整风运动开始以前，在一部分干部中存在着各种不同的思想顾虑，因此北京市委曾再三强调指出：这次整风运动的主要方法是学习文件，总结工作，分析情况，展开批评与自我批评。整风的目的是改进工作，提高干部和党员的思想水平及政治水平，克服官僚主义和命令主义，不要在个人生活等小问题上打圈子。关于非党干部的整风问题，市委亦指出：在总结工作时党与非党干部应一视同仁，在检讨个人思想作风时，则应有所区别。市府亦曾召开党、团员干部动员大会，由薛子正秘书长报告整风的目的和方法。对整风的认识端正后，一般干部信心提高，在检查总结工作的会议上都能积极发言。
    有的单位因为没有抓住以总结工作为主这一基本环节，整风走了些弯路，如市府清管局整风中，领导上要下面有什么说什么，而没有把大家的意见引导到总结工作方面，结果所提意见中有很大一部分是个人生活、待遇、作风等小问题，因而整风运动无法深入，不能达到改进与提高工作的目的。
    首长负责亲自动手，也是使整风运动深入开展的重要关键。这次整风开始后，市委召集的每一次座谈会，彭真同志都亲自主持，虚心听取意见，解答问题，并审查各单位的整风计划。市府张友渔、吴晗副市长，也都亲自主持整风会议。参加座谈会的干部一致认为这样的会议很能解决问题。市府、市公安局在市长、局长领导下成立了整风办公室，加强对整风的领导，并派干部深入下层去了解情况，保证了整风计划的贯彻与执行。
    抓紧领导，有计划、有步骤、有准备的开始整风，及时防止与纠正偏向，使整风运动步入正轨，这也是整风运动的重要关键。各单位的整风计划与检查总结工作要点，都是经过上级领导机关审查批准后才开始进行的。卫生局曾规定科股长以上干部才能学习文件；三区区公所拟把总结工作与一般干部思想总结平列同时进行。这些偏向都是在审查各单位整风计划中被发现而得到了纠正。
    北京市的整风，是在城市领导集中、工作忙的情况下进行的，所以采取了在坚持工作中同时进行整风的办法。如商业局在整风开始前总结了八月份的工作，向所属各单位具体布置了九月份的工作，这样就不致因领导机关整风而使下面工作停顿。有的单位对此注意不够，如税务局整风时，把各税务分局局长集中在一起开了八、九天会，有些分局的工作，就受到了影响。
    目前北京市的整风除继续揭发与检讨工作中的缺点错误外，重点已转移到研究改进工作的办法和制度方面。这项工作是比仅仅指出缺点和错误困难得多，也重要得多。这是北京市当前整风阶段中的关键。（萧甲）
