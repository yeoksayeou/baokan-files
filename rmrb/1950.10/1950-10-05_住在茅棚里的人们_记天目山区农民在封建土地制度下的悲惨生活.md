　　People Living in Thatched Huts
    Recording the Miserable Life of Farmers in the Tianmu Mountain Area Under the Feudal Land System
    Gong Ce
    The western Zhejiang mountain area, with its lush bamboo and forests, and overlapping mountains and ridges, concentrates the beauty of the Jiangnan landscape. The beautiful Tianmu Mountain used to be a "paradise" for leisure and pleasure. But beneath this "paradise" lies the grief and indignation of the farmers. The feudal land system and the occupation of forests have painted a dim color on the beautiful Jiangnan scenery.
    The reporter visited the Lin'an Special District, which surrounds the Tianmu Mountain area, encompassing eleven counties. Here, apart from a small number of towns, there are scattered gray thatched huts everywhere, standing on mountain gullies, hillsides, and even mountaintops. Thousands upon thousands of wasteland reclaimers—poor farmers—live in these thatched huts. Mountainous areas like this account for more than 71% of Zhejiang Province.
    Tianmu Mountain Area Has Little Farmland, Farmers Depend on Mountain Forest Life
    The district has more mountains than farmland; mountain forests account for 80% of the total area of the special district. In Changhua and Fenshui counties, southwest of the main peak of Tianmu Mountain, the area of mountains accounts for more than 90%. In these high mountains and ridges, the amount of arable land is extremely small. The entire district has a population of over one million, but only 1.2 million mu of farmland. Although there is so little cultivated land, the landlord class, accounting for only 4% of the population, owns 50% of the land. Farmers, accounting for 90% of the population, only have ownership rights to 40% of the barren land. More than half of the population has either completely lost their land or owns only a very small amount of it. The lack of land forces 50% to 60% of the farmers in the entire district to rely on mountain forest management for their livelihoods. They live next to the fields and build houses on the mountains, engaging in excessive and risky labor all year round. Many people have been opening up mountains and cultivating land for generations, but they never own a piece of land in their entire lives.
    Landlords Occupy Mountain Forests and Rent Them Out at High Prices—Who Says “There Is No Feudalism in the Jiangnan Countryside”?
    Landlords developed from land annexation to the occupation of mountain forests. The wealthy and powerful would "declare grain and pay taxes" to the government to obtain mountain forests, while others would rely on their power to "designate mountains as boundaries," incorporating large areas of "ownerless" mountain forests into their privately made contracts. For example, Lihu Township in Fenshui County had a very small population before 1917, and many mountain forests were ownerless. In 1917, when Duan Qirui was in power, he ordered the establishment of a "Mountain Clearing Bureau," requiring the masses to claim mountains and pay taxes. The Mountain Clearing Bureau was mostly controlled by landlords and gentry. The Mountain Clearing Bureau of the township was headed by Wang Bingrong, a former tribute student of the Qing Dynasty, and his son Wang Zhimin was the secretary of the Mountain Clearing Bureau. The father and son held all the power and occupied a quarter of the mountain forests in the township. Currently, in addition to some uncultivated virgin forests and useless "ownerless" barren mountains in the special district, landlords occupy more than 70% of the manageable mountain forests. The large landlord Zhou Maoxing in Xiaofeng County owns nearly 10,000 mu of mountain forests. The calculation of mountain mu includes various methods such as "shouting mountain mu" (i.e., the area within the reach of a shout is one mu), "gong-striking mu," "rock-rolling mu," and "estimating mountain mu." The actual occupied area often exceeds its mu count by dozens of times. In Xiaofeng, Lin'an, Yuqian, and other places, the scope of landlords' occupation of mountain forests sometimes extends to an entire township or county.
    The cruel feudal exploitation facts in the mountainous countryside expose the landlord class's fallacy that "there is no feudalism in the Jiangnan countryside." Landlords force farmers to pay 60% to 70% of the land harvest to the landlords every year as rent. In the several counties visited by the reporter, almost every county had a "local emperor" who "occupied mountains as king." For example, the "Female Tiger" in Lin'an County, the "Four Great Masters" in Xiaofeng County, the "Four Great Families" in Yuqian County, and the "Five Tigers of the Chen Family" in Changhua County. Landlords in the district generally implement a "fixed rent system" that collects 60% or 70% of the farmers' grain harvest as rent. The tenant farmers bear the cost of cattle power and fertilizer themselves. Some farmers who have bad land only get 20% or 10% after a year of hard work. In many areas, there are also pre-rent systems, contract rent systems, live rent systems, as well as empty rent, corvée rent, military service rent, and extra-economic exploitation such as sending New Year's gifts. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the rural landlords and the Kuomintang reactionary regime were closely linked. All the puppet township chiefs were landlords or lackeys of landlords. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, the forces of the reactionary party and league have penetrated deeply into the western Zhejiang mountain area. At that time, a saying "no party, no family" was circulating in Changhua County. Many local despots controlled the political power, possessed arms, and even the township chiefs had the right to kill people. Shao Zhancheng, a large landlord in Yuqian County who rented out thousands of mu of land, had beaten to death or starved to death seven or eight farmers. The Shao family owned dozens of short guns, rifles, and four machine guns. Farmers who rented Shao's land had to provide several months of "military service rent" every year to help the Shao family suppress "bandits."
    Feudal Exploitation Hinders Improved Production, Poor Farmers Have to Seek Food in the Mountains
    All kinds of sinful feudal exploitation and reactionary rule severely dampened the farmers' enthusiasm for production. Many farmers did not dare to apply more fertilizer or dig ponds for irrigation. Qian A'huo and a dozen other farmers in Beishan Valley, Xinxi Township, Lin'an County, had their rent increased from 80 jin to 160 jin because they had worked hard for decades to turn barren mountains into fields and bad fields into good fields. The rice fields in the valley are always afraid of drought, but they are afraid that the landlords will increase the rent again after they dig ponds, so they can only rely on the heavens for food every year. Farmers in Yuqian County are always worried about landlords seizing their fields at the end of the year. Those threatened with field seizure must entertain and give gifts, begging the landlords to increase the rent in order to avoid the seizure. The farmers said: "Fertilizer cannot be applied to guest fields (i.e., rented fields)." The mountainous area has unfavorable natural conditions, and water and drought disasters often prevent farmers from paying rent. Landlords in Fuyang, Yuqian, Xindeng, and other counties generally implement a "pre-rent system" to prevent this "natural disaster." Farmers are charged a year's rent before they plant the fields. When the harvest is bad, the pre-rent is used as collateral, and sometimes the pre-rent is turned into high-interest loans, subjecting farmers to double exploitation. In areas without pre-rent, landlords treat farmers' overdue rent as loans and collect interest of more than 50% on time. If the overdue rent is not paid off in two or three years, they simply seize the land. Zhou Xianfa, a tenant farmer in Xinxi Village, Lin'an County, complained to the reporter: "The landlord Zhou Xinfu has more than 700 mu of land. His large granary receives hundreds of thousands of jin of rent every year. Farmers who cannot pay the rent write IOU, paying back 1.5 dou next year for every 1 dou owed. If they still can't pay it back the next year, they use the interest as principal. If they still can't pay it back, they mortgage the field. Zhou's family has hundreds of jin of such 'IOU'!"
    Landlords built simple thatched huts, binding landless farmers to the mountains and forests. Farmers lived in these thatched huts, managing the mountains for the landlords and relying on opening up mountains to grow miscellaneous grains. Farmers often use very simple labor methods to cultivate on extremely steep slopes. After the barren mountains are opened up, mountain water rushes down rapidly, widening a river in Changhua urban area year by year, causing great damage to the fields on both sides of the river. The reclaimed wasteland is mostly barren and infertile after being cultivated for three years, and farmers have to look for other places to reclaim again. The farmers who open up mountains year after year open up new wastelands and abandon old wastelands, making it difficult to accumulate land. Zhou Xianfa, a tenant farmer in Xinxi Village, came to open up mountains in his grandfather's generation, but he only has 0.3 mu of land today. Hard work exhausts the farmers, and they even risk their lives to fight for survival. In Changbei District, Changhua County, tragic accidents of rolling down the mountain and dying have occurred repeatedly during mountain opening. The wasteland opened up by farmers has to pay 20% of miscellaneous grain rent to the landlord every year. Those who do not pay rent cultivate tree seedlings for the landlord as compensation, and "return the mountain after raising seedlings" after the farmers abandon the wasteland. Due to the feudal land system and primitive management methods, people in thatched huts cannot make long-term plans for settling down and establishing a career. They have no hometown. Most of them have to seek food after opening up nearby fertile mountains into barren mountains in twenty or thirty years. They suffer the pain of migration and displacement throughout their lives. When the reporter went to Zhuan'ge Township, Changhua County, to visit, there were eight thatched huts in Yuantou Village (mountain valley name). They have been opening up mountains here for more than 20 years. The nearby barren mountains have been repeatedly cultivated, and most of them have become barren mountains. The farmers sighed and said: "After opening up for a few more years, we will have to move away."
    Landlords and Treacherous Merchants Employed Cunning Ways to Seize Fortunes, Poor and Hired Farmers Sold Their Wives and Drowned Infants
    Poverty has made the production and living standards of mountain farmers extremely low. The mountainous area is convenient for animal husbandry, but farmers generally cannot afford to raise draft animals, relying on renting cattle for farming. The means of production for farmers specializing in mountain opening are even more rudimentary, mostly just a hoe and a sickle. Because the "large paddy fields" and "weir fields" near rivers and ponds with fertile soil are mostly occupied by landlords, farmers only have "mountain valley fields" (i.e., fields in the middle of mountain valleys) and "heaven-dependent fields" (i.e., fields on mountain slopes). They have no ability to dig ponds and no money to apply fertilizer, so the yield is sometimes as low as less than half. The hardship of life makes the farmers sallow and thin. In Fenshui, Changhua, and other counties, farmers in some large mountainous areas often have to rely on mountain flour (a substitute food) and wild vegetables mixed with a small amount of corn flour to fill their stomachs. Landlords, treacherous merchants, and usurers often take advantage of the farmers' difficulties during the lean season and the inconvenient transportation in the mountainous areas to seize their fortunes. In Yuhang County, the most serious case was the forced purchase of farmers' produce at one-tenth of the price. In Changhua County, daily necessities such as cloth and salt were loaned to farmers in kind at a high interest rate of 100%. Farmers' daily necessities are simple to the lowest limit. In Changbei District, Changhua County, some people do not eat salt for several months. Many farmers in Shanhe Township, Jiande County, burn oil pine wood at night instead of lights; Yu Zhangyun, a very poor farmer in the township, lived for more than 40 years without wearing a new pair of shoes. Because he could not afford new clothes and quilts, he roasted firewood to sleep in winter, and sometimes covered himself with palm bark in summer.
    Poverty and hard labor have brought diseases and tragic family lives. Schistosomiasis is extremely prevalent in rural areas, causing swollen legs and abdominal distension. In the western part of Changhua County, some villages were about to be completely depopulated of able-bodied men (this disease is not easily transmitted to women) due to the spread of abdominal distension year after year, leaving many widows, resulting in the abandonment of many fields. Malignant malaria is prevalent in large mountainous areas. In Dongwu Village, Changhua County, children mostly cannot grow up due to the spread of this disease. I personally witnessed many children with sallow complexions and weak bodies in the village. There are very few young people to be seen in the village. Tragedies such as selling wives, drowning infants, and selling children were extremely common in mountainous areas. The barbaric "selling wife system" sells women to wealthy people like commodities to "have children." During the contract period, couples are only allowed to meet once during the New Year's holiday. However, many selling wife systems also occur between farmers. Wang Baishun, a hired farmhand in Houying Village, Changhua County, sold the wife of Zhu Mei's daughter, a poor farmer, for a ten-year contract. Many farmers were forced to sell their wives to single men who could not afford a wife for half their lives due to extreme poverty and inability to support their families. The drowning of infants, the sale of children, and the selling wife system have deprived many farmers of family happiness. Some parents were forced by poverty to continuously kill or abandon several infants. A poor farmer's wife in Fuyang urban area gave birth to eight children, and three of them were drowned by her husband. The old feudal system made kind parents painfully abandon their children.
    Farmers Rise Up in Struggle and Finally Gain Liberation, Eagerly Demanding Land Reform
    However, the farmers in the Tianmu Mountain area did not succumb to the oppression of the landlord class and the collusion between the Kuomintang. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, the farmers in the border area of Zhejiang and Anhui have continuously persisted in their struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party. At the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when General Su Yu led the New Fourth Army to the Tianmu Mountain area, many farmers enthusiastically joined the New Fourth Army and guerrillas, actively attacking the enemy and carrying out struggles against grain requisition, rent, and levies. In Anji, Wukang, and other counties, hundreds of farmers suffered bloody retaliation from the enemy for leading the struggle. The blood of the farmers did not flow in vain. The dark days finally came to an end. After the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River, the vast number of farmers and guerrillas cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to quickly liberate the western Zhejiang mountain area. The people's red flag was planted on Tianmu Mountain, and Tianmu Mountain began to change color. In the past year, after the initial mobilization of the farmers, they eagerly demanded to change the unreasonable land system. After the promulgation of the Land Reform Law by the Central People's Government, the farmers said in unison: "Chairman Mao is a great benefactor. We have today because of Chairman Mao."

　　住在茅棚里的人们
    记天目山区农民在封建土地制度下的悲惨生活
    宫策
    秀竹茂林、叠山丛岭的浙西山区，集中了江南风光之美。美丽的天目山是往日消闲冶游的“乐园”。但这“乐园”的底层，蕴藏着农民的悲愤。封建的土地制度，山林的被霸占，给美丽的江南风光，涂上了黯淡的颜色。
    记者访问了天目山区周围十一个县的临安专区。在这里，除了数目不多的城镇以外，到处是三三两两的灰色茅棚，分散地伫立在山沟山腰甚至山顶上。千千万万的荒山开垦者——贫苦农民，就在这些茅棚里居住。类同这样的山区，在浙江省占了百分之七十一以上。
    天目山区山多田少农民经营山林生活
    该区山多田少，山林占全专区面积的百分之八十。天目山主峰西南部的昌化、分水等县山的面积竟占达百分之九十以上。在这些高山丛岭中，可耕的土地数量极少，全专区人口百余万，仅有一百二十万亩田地。耕田虽如此少，而占人口百分之四的地主阶级竟占有土地达百分之五十。占百分之九十的农民只对百分之四十的瘦瘠土地有所有权。其中一半以上的人口则是根本失去了土地或只占有极少量的土地。土地缺乏，使全区百分之五十至六十的农民不得不依靠经营山林而生活。他们傍田而居，依山筑舍，整年整月地进行着过度的和冒险的操劳。许许多多人是世世代代开山种地，却终生没有一块土地。
    地主霸占山林高额出租谁说“江南农村无封建”
    地主由土地的兼并发展到山林的霸占，有钱有势的人向官府“报粮认税”领取山林，有的则依靠势力“指山为界”，将大片“无主”的山林归并在自己私造的契约之内。如分水县蠡湖乡在一九一七年以前人口特少，许多山林无主经营，一九一七年段祺瑞执政时，并勒令建立“清山局”，要群众领山认税。清山局多为地主豪绅所把持，该乡清山局即是本乡的满清拔贡王秉融任总董事，王曾任淳安县知事，其子王植民任清山局秘书，父子二人总揽大权，霸占了该乡四分之一的山林。现在该专区除部分尚未开垦的原始山林和无用的“无主”荒山之外，地主霸占可经营的山林竟达百分之七十以上。孝丰县大地主周茂兴占有山林将近万亩以上。山亩的计算有“喝山亩”（即喊声所至为一亩）及“敲锣亩”、“滚石亩”、“估山亩”等各种方法，其实际占有面积往往超过其亩数的数十倍。孝丰、临安、于潜等地地主霸占山林的范围有的遍及一乡一县。
    山区农村残酷的封建剥削事实，揭穿了地主阶级所谓“江南农村无封建”的滥调。地主强迫农民每年以百分之六十至七十的土地收获量向地主征租，在记者所访问到的几个县里，几乎每县都有着“占山为王”的“土皇帝”。例如临安县的“雌老虎”、孝丰县的“四大老爷”、于潜县的“四大家”、昌化县的“陈家五虎”。该区地主普遍实行一种征收农民百分之六十或七十租谷的“订租制”，佃户所需的牛力肥料均由自己负担，有些田坏的农民辛苦一年却只得二成或一成。在许多地区又有预租制、包租制、活租制及空头租、劳役租、兵役租、送年节礼等苛杂的超经济剥削。国民党反动统治时期，农村的地主和国民党反动政权密切地结合着，所有的伪乡长都是地主或地主的爪牙充任。自抗日战争以来反动党团的势力更深入到浙西山区，当时在昌化县曾流传着一句“无党不成家”的谚语，许多恶霸地主控制了政权，拥有武装，甚至乡长有杀人的权利。于潜县出租千亩土地的大地主邵展成，曾经打死饿死七、八个农民，邵家拥有数十枝短枪、步枪和四挺机枪，租种邵家土地的农民每年须有几个月的“兵役租”替邵家去剿“匪”。
    封建剥削妨碍改进生产贫苦农民只得寻山求食
    种种罪恶的封建剥削和反动的统治严重的打击了农民的生产情绪，许多农民不敢增施肥料、不敢开塘灌田。临安县新溪乡北山谷里钱阿火等十几家农民就是因为数十年的辛苦将荒山开成田，将坏田变好田，而租子由八十斤一直加到一百六十斤。山谷里的稻田常年怕旱，但他们怕开了水塘以后地主又要加租，因此年年只有靠天吃饭。于潜县农民每到年关就提心吊胆地怕地主来抽田，受到抽田威胁的必须请客送礼，恳求地主加租才能免去抽田。农民说：“有肥料不能施在客田（即租田）里”。山区有着不利的自然条件，水旱灾害经常使农民交不上租，富阳、于潜、新登等县地主为了预防这一“天灾”，普遍实行“预租制”，农民未种田之前先被征收一年的租，年成坏时就以预租抵押，有时将预租变为高利贷，使农民受到双重的剥削。没有预租的地区，地主将农民的欠租作为借款，按期征收百分之五十以上的利息，欠租二三年还不清的就干脆押田。临安县新溪村佃贫农周显法向记者诉苦道：“地主周信甫有田七百多亩，他的大谷仓里每年收进几十万斤租子，农民纳不上租的就写下欠租票，来年一石还一石五斗，还不上的就以利作本，下一年再还不上就把田押去，这样的“欠租票”在周家有几百斤啊！”
    地主建筑一个简单的茅棚，将失去土地的农民束缚在山林上，农民借居在这些茅棚里一面替地主管山，一面依靠开山种杂粮。农民往往在极陡的坡度上用极简单的劳作方法进行开垦。荒山被开出后，山水便急遽的冲下，昌化城区的一条河道就是这样的逐年加宽，河两岸的田地遭到极大的破坏。所开的荒地也大都在耕种三年之后即山瘦地薄，农民只得再另寻他处重新开垦。许山开山的农民就是这样年年开新荒，年年抛旧荒，很难积下土地。新溪村佃贫农周显法，祖父一代就来开山，但至今却只有三分田。艰苦的经营使农民精疲力尽，甚至冒了性命的危险为生活而斗争。昌化县昌北区农民在开山中曾经屡次发生过滚山跌死的惨剧。农民开的荒山每年要向地主交纳百分之二十的杂粮租。不交租的给地主培植树苗作报酬，农民抛荒之后“养苗还山”。由于封建的土地制度和原始的经营方式，使茅棚里的人们不能做安家立业的长远打算，他们没有故乡，大都经二三十年将附近的肥山开成瘦山之后便要寻山求食。终生吃尽迁徙流离之苦。记者到昌化县转革乡去访问时，该乡源头里（山谷名）有着八户茅棚，他们来此开山已有二十余年，附近的荒山已经过轮番的开垦，现大多已变成瘦山了，农民叹息着说：“再开几年就只好搬走了。”
    地主奸商巧取豪夺贫雇农民典妻溺婴
    贫穷使山区农民的生产和生活水平极为低下。山区便于畜牧，但农民普遍养不起耕畜，依靠租牛耕田。专门开山的农民生产资料则更为简陋，多仅有一张镢头一把镰刀。因为近河近塘土质肥沃的“大畈田”“堰田”大都为地主所占有，农民只有“山坞田”（即山谷中间的田）和“靠天田”（即山坡上的田），他们无力开水塘，没钱施肥料，因此产量有的低到一倍以下。生活的困苦使农民面黄肌瘦。分水和昌化等县有的大山区里农民经常须依靠山粉（代食品）和野菜掺以少量的玉米粉充饥。地主奸商和高利贷者常利用农民青黄不接的困难和山区的交通不便，向农民巧取豪夺，余杭县最严重的有以十分之一的价格强购农民的生产品，在昌化县又有以百分之百的高利向农民实物贷放布、盐等日用品。农民的日常用品简陋到最低限度。昌化县昌北区有的数月吃不到食盐。建德县山鹤乡许多农民夜里点燃油松木代替灯光；该乡赤贫农余樟云活了四十多岁没穿过一双新鞋，因为买不起新衣盖不上棉被，冬天烤柴睡眠，夏天有时以棕皮遮身。
    贫困和艰苦的劳作带来了疾病和悲剧式的家庭生活。农村中极为普遍的流行着吸血虫病，腿肿、腹胀，昌化县西部有个别的乡由于连年腹胀病的蔓延，使有些村庄的壮年男子即将死光（此病妇女不易传染），剩下很多寡妇，因而许多田地荒芜了。大山区里传染着恶性疟疾，昌化县东坞村就因此种疾病的传染，儿童们多无法养大。我在该村曾亲眼目睹许多孩子面色焦黄，身体孱弱，在该村所能看到的青年人已寥寥无几。山区里曾极为普遍的演出了典妻、溺婴、卖子等悲剧。野蛮的“典妻制”将妇女如同商品一样出卖给有钱人“生孩子”。典期之内有的只准夫妻在年节相会一次。但典妻制度又有许多是出现在农民之间。昌化县后营村雇农王柏顺以十年的典期典进贫农朱梅女的妻子。许多农民因为极度贫困无力养家，被迫将妻子出典给半世讨不起老婆的单身汉。溺婴、卖子及典妻制度使不少的农民失去了家庭的幸福。有些父母被贫穷逼迫着连续杀死或丢弃几个婴儿，富阳城区有一贫苦农妇连生八个孩子，被丈夫溺死了三个。旧的封建制度使善良的父母忍痛割弃了儿女。
    农民奋起斗争终获解放迫切要求进行土地改革
    但是天目山区的农民在地主阶级和国民党相互勾结压榨下，他们没有屈服。自抗日战争时期，浙皖边区农民就在共产党的领导下不断地坚持了斗争。抗日战争的末期粟裕将军带领新四军打到天目山区时，不少的农民踊跃的参加了新四军和游击队，积极打击敌人和进行抗粮抗租抗捐等斗争。在安吉、武康等县即有数百农民因为领导斗争而遭受敌人血腥的报复。农民们的血没有白流，黑暗的日子终有了结束的一天，解放军渡江南下以后，广大农民和游击队配合解放军迅速解放了浙西山区，人民的红旗插上天目山，天目山开始变色了。一年多来农民经过了初步的发动，他们迫切地要求改变不合理的土地制度。中央人民政府土地改革法令颁布以后，农民同声欢庆的说：“毛主席是大恩人，有了毛主席才有今天。”
