　　Minjian Issues Letter to Members Calling for Active Donations of Winter Clothing
    [This newspaper dispatch] The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (Minjian) has issued a letter to its members in response to the campaign to raise winter clothing to aid disaster victims. The full text is as follows:
    Since July of this year, continuous rain has caused disasters in parts of northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Hebei, and Henan provinces. Furthermore, due to the past actions of the Chiang bandits in breaching the Yellow River into the Huai River, the Huai River has become silted up and prone to flooding. Consequently, the disaster situation in areas such as Xinyang and Huangchuan in northern Anhui and Henan is particularly severe. With winter approaching rapidly, the disaster victims urgently need winter clothing. Therefore, relevant organizations and people's groups in Beijing have jointly established the General Association for Raising Winter Clothing for Disaster Victims in Northern Anhui, Northern Jiangsu, Hebei, and Henan, launching a nationwide campaign to raise winter clothing for disaster victims. To respond to this call, in addition to sending letters to local branches to mobilize, the Federation, on behalf of the more than ten million disaster victims without clothing, makes an urgent appeal to all members, hoping that everyone will fully promote the spirit of unity, mutual assistance, and friendship, and actively donate winter clothing.
                (Guo Zhen)
    [Another dispatch] The Beijing Municipal Branch of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce held a work conference of all department heads on September 29th. In response to the call from the General Federation, it formed a Disaster Victim Winter Clothing Donation Committee, and appointed Yu Zhong, Mo Yichang, and others as members of the committee. It was decided that each member should donate at least one item of winter clothing, and complete the task by the end of October. (Guo Zhen)

　　民建发表告会员书号召踊跃捐助寒衣
    【本报讯】民主建国会总会为响应劝募寒衣救济灾民运动，发表告会员书，全文如下：
    自从今年七月以来，皖北苏北河北河南的部分地区霪雨为灾，更由于过去蒋匪决黄入淮，益使淮流淤塞泛滥，故皖北河南信阳潢川等区灾情尤为惨重。转瞬冬令即届，灾民迫切需要寒衣，兹由京地各有关机关及人民团体发起成立皖北苏北河北河南灾民灾衣劝募总会，展开全国灾民寒衣劝募运动，本会为响应这个号召，除分函各地分会群起发动外，谨代表千余万无衣灾民向我全体会员作紧急的呼吁，希望大家充分发扬团结互助友爱的精神，踊跃捐助寒衣。
                （国桢）
    【又讯】民主建国会北京市分会九月二十九日各处处长工作会议，响应总会号召，组成灾民寒衣劝募委员会，并推定于忠、莫艺昌等为该委员会委员，决定每一会员起码捐助寒衣一件，并于十月底完成任务。（国桢）
