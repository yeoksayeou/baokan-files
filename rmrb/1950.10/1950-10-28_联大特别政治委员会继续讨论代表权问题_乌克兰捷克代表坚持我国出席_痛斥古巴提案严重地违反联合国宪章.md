Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 26th: The United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee continued its debate on the question of recognizing the representation of member states of the United Nations on the morning of October 25th. At the beginning of the meeting, the representative of the Dominican Republic put forward a new proposal, suggesting that this issue be included in the agenda of the sixth session of the General Assembly, pending the study of the issue by the International Court of Justice.

	However, most of the debate still revolved around the Cuban proposal and the British proposal. The former proposal illegally suggested establishing criteria as conditions for recognizing the representation of UN member states; the latter proposal declared that the United Nations must agree to the representation of governments that effectively control the territory of a country.

	The representative of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic, Mr. Voinia, spoke first. He said that the reason why this issue is being brought to the General Assembly is to undermine the UN Charter. The UN Charter and the procedures adopted by UN agencies contain ample provisions for dealing with this issue. UN agencies have the right to decide on the representation of member states themselves. He pointed out that it is clear that only the legitimate government of a member state has the right to issue the credentials of that country's representatives.

	Voinia denounced the Cuban proposal's attempt to abolish the normal procedures of international relations and its illegal attempt to give the General Assembly the right to interfere in the internal affairs of member states, which the Charter expressly prohibits. Voinia said that the issue of representation of member states arose from the actions of certain UN agencies refusing to allow representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend. The Cuban delegation is trying to use this situation to provide a basis for further violations of the UN Charter.

	The Swedish representative, Mr. Sorman, opposed the Cuban proposal and said that he preferred the British proposal, but he opposed any attempt to establish any criteria for the representation of member states at present.

	The Czechoslovak representative, Mr. Hajdu, supported Voinia's arguments. He said that the issue clearly involves the representation of the People's Republic of China, and that this issue can only be resolved by allowing the legitimate representatives of the Chinese people to attend. Hajdu said that the Cuban proposal would enable the United States, and eventually other countries, to directly interfere in the internal affairs of member states.

	The representative of El Salvador supported the Cuban proposal.

	The Venezuelan representative, Mr. Plaza, vehemently opposed the Cuban proposal, believing that this proposal violated the Charter and the stipulated international law. He said that passing the Cuban proposal would allow interference in the internal affairs of member states.

	The representative of Burma also supported the British proposal. The representative of Paraguay, Mr. Chavez, said that he could not support either proposal.

	The representative of Honduras supported the Cuban proposal. The representative of Greece, Mr. Giro, said that Greece could not support either proposal, but Greece would not oppose the Dominican Republic's suggestion to retain this issue on the agenda of the next session of the General Assembly pending study by the International Court of Justice. The committee then adjourned.

### 联大特别政治委员会继续讨论代表权问题  乌克兰捷克代表坚持我国出席  痛斥古巴提案严重地违反联合国宪章

　　联大特别政治委员会继续讨论代表权问题
    乌克兰捷克代表坚持我国出席
    痛斥古巴提案严重地违反联合国宪章
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社纽约二十六日讯：联合国大会特别政治委员会在十月二十五日上午继续辩论承认联合国会员代表权的问题。在会议开始时，多米尼加共和国代表提出新提案，建议将这一问题列入联大第六届会议的议程，以待国际法庭研究这一问题。
    但是大部分辩论仍环绕着古巴的提案及英国的提案。前一提案非法地建议确立准则，作为承认联合国会员国代表权的条件；后一提案宣称联合国必须同意对国家领土保有有效的控制权力之政府的代表权。
    乌克兰苏维埃共和国代表伏伊那首先发言。他说，现在所讨论的这个问题之所以向大会提出，是为了破坏联合国宪章。联合国宪章和联合国各机构所采用的程序中包含着处理这一问题的充足的规定。联合国各机构有权自行决定会员国的代表权。他并指出，很清楚，只有合法的会员国政府才有权发出该国代表的全权证书。
    伏伊那痛斥古巴提案企图取消国际关系的正常程序，并且非法地企图给大会以宪章明文禁止的干涉会员国内政的权利。伏伊那说，会员国代表权问题是由于某些联合国机构拒绝准许中华人民共和国代表出席的行动而发生的。古巴代表团力图利用这一情势来为进一步违犯联合国宪章的提供根据。
    瑞典代表索尔曼反对古巴的提案，并说，他更赞成英国的提案，但他反对在目前为会员国代表权确立任何准则的任何企图。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表哈奇杜支持伏伊那的论点。他说，问题显然涉及中华人民共和国的代表权，并且只有准许中国人民的合法代表出席才能解决这一问题。哈奇杜说，古巴提案将使美国，最后还有其他国家，能够直接干涉会员国内政。
    萨尔瓦多代表支持古巴的提案。
    委内瑞拉代表普拉查猛烈反对古巴的提案，认为这一提案违犯宪章及规定的国际法。他说，通过古巴的提案就是允许干涉会员国内政。
    缅甸代表也支持英国的提案。巴拉圭代表夏维斯说，两个提案他都不能支持。
    洪都拉斯代表支持古巴的提案。希腊代表基罗说，两个提案希腊都不能加以支持，但希腊将不反对多米尼加共和国所提将这一问题保留于联大下届会议的议程以待国际法庭研究的建议。委员会于是宣告休会。
