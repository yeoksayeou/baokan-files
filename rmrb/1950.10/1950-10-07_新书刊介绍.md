　　Introduction to New Books and Periodicals
　　Special Issue Celebrating the First Anniversary of the Joint Publication of Five Magazines Including People's Literature
    The special commemorative issue "First Anniversary of Victory," jointly edited by five magazines—Wenyi Bao (Literature and Art Gazette), People's Literature, People's Drama, People's Fine Arts, and People's Music—to celebrate the first anniversary of the founding of the nation, was published on October 1st. The editorial, "Our Glory and Hope," pointed out the achievements in literary and artistic work over the past year and the hopes for the future. Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, and Ding Ling wrote poems and general essays titled "A Year of Rapid Progress," "Striving to Develop to a Higher Stage," and "Continue the Efforts," respectively. The Czech Ambassador Weisskopf (writer) also rushed to write "My View of New China" for the special issue. Huang Yaomian's "Talking About Several Issues in Literature and Art," Wang Shuming's "The Development and Problems of Literary Criticism in the Past Year," Zang Kejia's "The Image of Combat Heroes," Wu Xiaobang's "Let the Dance Work Move Forward More Vigorously," Zhong Jingwen's "The Folk Literature and Art Movement in the Past Year," Xiao San's "The New Posture of Sino-Foreign Cultural Exchange," and Kang Tuo's "Looking Back at the Year" all discussed and introduced various aspects of literary and artistic work. Tian Jian, Yan Chen, Lü Jian, Xu Chi, and others dedicated odes to the motherland and National Day. In addition, Cao Jinghua, Ouyang Yuqian, Yu Pingbo, Xu Beihong, Lao She, Feng Zhi, Yang Shuo, Chen Huangmei, Hu Su, Gu Yuan, Bian Zhilin, Yang Shaoxuan, Huang Zhigang, Ma Shaobo, Wang Yaping, and others contributed poems, articles, and paintings to the special issue. The joint special issue is a thick volume of over 120,000 words.
　　《Soviet Literature》September Issue
    The September issue of "Soviet Literature," distributed by International Bookstore, arrived in Beijing on the 6th of this month. This issue prominently features Stalin's brilliant work on linguistics, "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics," as well as two related articles, "Concerning Marxism in Linguistics" and "Reply to Comrades."
    The majority of this issue is dedicated to Kakov’s Stalin Prize-winning novel, "Here the Morning is Already." The novel is set against the backdrop of Sakhalin Island in the Soviet Far East, a territory that belonged to Russia long ago. The southern part of this island was ceded to Japan in 1905 and returned to the embrace of the great Soviet Motherland in 1945. Kakov witnessed and understood the changes in life on the island after liberation; all shameless exploitation ceased; local industry and economic life are developing rapidly; the socialist system has brought freedom and happiness to the island's residents. The author, drawing on his personal experience in participating in the establishment of a new life on the island, created this realistic and highly attractive novel. It describes the initial stage of the new life there.
    The "Defend Peace" section includes Polevoi's "In the Great Cause of Defending Peace" and Sarkov's "The Power of Peace," etc. The "Literature and Art" section includes Kalidin's "On Several New Dramas" and Zerov's "Outstanding Satirical Writer." The "Overseas Literary News" section includes Yelistratova's "The Enemies of Peace Are Exposed" (introducing J. Odlyzh's new work "Diplomat") and Leonidov's "'Orpheus' in the Mire" (reviewing "Orpheus," a collection of literary essays edited by the British J. Lehmann for American propaganda). There is also a "Magazine Introduction" (introducing the World Peace Council's organ, the monthly magazine "Defend Peace") and several book reviews.

    In addition, "Half a Submachine Gun" tells the story of a resourceful Korean People's Army soldier who captured thirty-two enemies with a broken submachine gun; "Climbing the Telephone Pole and Putting Up Slogans to Fight for Peace" depicts the heroic struggle of the American people for peace; "Yao People" introduces one of China's ethnic minorities; "Arguing" is a satirical folk tale about landlords; "Morning Glory and Sunflower" is a story-poem that teaches children to work hard, grow up to be independent, and not rely on others.
