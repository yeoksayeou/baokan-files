The People's Avengers

	Pravda, Pyongyang Dispatch

	South Korean farmers, standing at their doorsteps, were smoking and watching with satisfaction the dust raised on the road. The hateful Syngman Rhee's and American troops are running south. The farmers saw two cars stop in front of the landlord's new house—the wall of this house is made of stone, like a temple—and the fat landlord hurriedly helped the servants load the suitcases into the cars. Where has this scoundrel's arrogance and prestige gone! Things he wouldn't even touch with his finger before, now he carries on his shoulder like a porter.
	"Obviously, he is very annoyed," said old Qiang Dofu, who has many children and even more grandchildren.
	The old man hates the landlord, so he is now happy to see the enemy's downfall. The debts to the landlord were like spider webs, binding all the local farmers. Farmers had to owe him debts for renting land, using wooden plows, and using cattle on barren fields. He called on the farmers to help him, but everyone pretended not to hear.
	The landlord, sitting beside the driver's seat of the truck, glanced at the farmers proudly as the car passed them, instructing them to protect his house and reminding them to take good care of three-quarters of the harvest from the rented land.
	The landlord left. Soon, a drunken American corporal appeared and posted an order written in Korean on the wall. He found someone among the illiterate farmers who could read and asked him to read the order aloud. The order stated that any Korean who did not go south with the American army would be executed. The corporal also made a meaningful gesture, demonstrating how to chop off heads with a large axe.
	Qiang Dofu took a deep drag on his cigarette and said to the people in the village that while it was still early, they should pack up and go to the mountains. The beloved mountains of their homeland could save them from everything that was happening in their lives.
	That night, Qiang Dofu led all the villagers, carrying food, into the mountains, away from the terrible highway where American soldiers marched day and night. On the hill, the old man sent out a sentry. Later, the sentry reported to the old man that the People's Army had entered the village.
	The people all returned home. In front of Qiang Dofu's house, there was a large tank covered with fresh branches. Soldiers were busy around the tank, and one of them who was squatting suddenly jumped up, opened his arms, and walked towards the old man, saying:
	"How are you, Dad!"
	The old man could hardly recognize this strong man, tanned by the sun, as his eldest son, Changwu. Eight years ago, that son left his wife and children to find work in the north. He entered a chemical factory in Xingnan as a laborer. That factory produced tens of thousands of tons of chemical fertilizer, but not even the last ounce was shipped to Japan, while the land of Korea had long been fertilized and irrigated with the salty sweat of tenant farmers. Changwu lived a poor life in Xingnan, but it was still better than the lives of his father, younger sons, and brothers. Soon, the second brother also went there, and the youngest brother went there when he came of age.
	Many changes have taken place since then. The Soviet army crushed the Japanese occupiers, but did not come to the village where Qiang Dofu's family lived. The 38th parallel divided Korea like a knife, dividing many families in half. Often, the husband was on one side, while the wife and children were on the other. Qiang Dofu lost his sons, losing his support in old age. Once, he walked to find them, but when he reached that cursed parallel, the military police would not let him pass.
	Qiang Dofu returned to the village. The Americans replaced the Japanese, but nothing changed in the lives of the farmers. It was still the same landlord renting out barren land and collecting three-quarters of the grain as rent. As a result, there was not enough food to feed the family.
	Now everything is gone. There are no Japanese, no Americans, no landlords, and no police. This nightmare that has haunted Qiang Dofu from childhood to old age is gone. Standing in front of him is his son with broad shoulders and golden officer's epaulets—the master of this powerful tank.
	Changwu let out a contagious burst of joyful laughter for a long time. When he left the village, he was an illiterate, but now he reads Kim Il-sung's speeches to his father, telling the villagers about the People's Committee, the land reform, and the bright and happy life in North Korea. The farmers know that the dreams of themselves and their ancestors for hundreds of years have finally come true. The land rented from the landlords will be given to them forever by the people's government; happiness has come to their dark and gloomy lives. They also understand that they should take up arms to defend this happiness, because there are still many conspiracies by the enemy to deprive them of their happiness.
	The wartime reunion was short. Changwu set off again to the south, where fierce battles were taking place. No one tried to stop him. When the motherland is in danger, it is a man's duty to be a soldier.
	Soon, representatives of the government came, all ordinary workers. They convened a meeting—the first congress, where you could say anything. Qiang Dofu was unanimously elected by the villagers as the chairman of the village people's committee.
	Along with the government representatives came a young woman, a teacher; she opened a primary school in the landlord's house, with one school for three villages. Qiang Dofu's grandchildren had the opportunity to study for the first time.
	The terraced fields on the hillside that belonged to the landlord were allocated to the farmers. For the first time in his sixty years of life, Qiang Dofu became the owner of the land, which was enough to feed his entire family. He was now able to dispose of the harvested grain himself.
	On September 1st, the children went to school—the landlord's house, a place they had never dared to approach before. The children sat quietly behind the desks, and the young female teacher from Pyongyang began to teach them to read.
	Peace and tranquility enveloped the village. The warm sunshine shone, and the full grains of rice ripened on the ears. But happiness did not last long. Two weeks after the village was liberated, American bombers flew in, circled in the air a few times, and began to bomb the thatched cottages. A large bomb fell on the school. Qiang Dofu saw flames rushing upwards like blood, and saw wood chips rotating in the air. His heart was broken by pain and terror. He ran to the school, and the dead female teacher was lying on the threshold, as if she had tried to use her body to protect the scattered boys and girls.
	The surviving children jumped out of the smoking ruins and ran towards a road they saw. They were deafened by fright and could not hear the old man's shouts. It turned out that the old man was telling them to stop, because he saw planes rushing straight from the hillside again, the pilots flying like whirlwinds, and the machine guns mowing down the terrified children like grass.
	This sight was the most terrible thing the old man had ever seen in his long life. The mothers who lost their children went crazy. They wandered over the ashes of their houses, groping in the hot ashes with their hands without feeling pain, and sometimes even smiled bitterly. Black smoke floated in the sky like mourning, and the murderers flew in the sky until late, enjoying their crimes.
	In Qiang Dofu's big family, only two boys remained—the children of the eldest son, the tank driver. Pain did not discourage the old man, but taught him a lesson. He became more active and more enthusiastic, and he supported the front line as much as possible. There were not many men left in the village. Most of them had gone with the ranks of the People's Army, and all the work needed to be undertaken by the women.
	Qiang Dofu called on everyone to build houses, and a dozen small houses were quickly built at the foot of the mountain by the river, where people who lost their property and houses came to live. Many requests were made to Qiang Dofu. People even rushed from neighboring villages to ask him for help or advice. Many things appeared around him that had to be resolved immediately and alone. The comfort items sent by the residents to the army had to be sent to the designated location immediately.
	In the south, the roar of artillery fire sounded day and night.
	The front line is not far away, we should prepare for the worst—the old man thought. The hateful landlord who threatened to return appeared in his mind. The chairman of the people's committee secretly built a food storage place behind the ridge, in a secluded place. He called on everyone to collect the weapons and ammunition discarded by the Americans along the road and transport them to the mountains.
	Ten days passed, and the sound of artillery fire did not move forward. The old man realized that the front line was in a state of stagnation. Then came the bad news that the Americans had launched an attack on Seoul from the rear.
	The harvest season arrived. The farmers were in the fields all day long. Qiang Dofu urged people to harvest and, in any case, not to leave the harvested rice in the fields, but to transport it to the mountains. Rice had to be harvested at night, because planes shot at working farmers during the day.
	Soon, the People's Army appeared on the highway, marching north. According to the order of the General Headquarters, they were to transfer to the new defense lines that had been prepared in advance. The tankers and Changwu also arrived. The officer invited his father to go with him, but the old man flatly refused. He could not leave his beloved hometown and abandon the residents under any circumstances. He wanted to go to the mountains with everyone.
	"The mountains of our beloved hometown can save us from disaster," Qiang Dofu said when he parted with his son.
	A few days later, Changwu read about the heroic activities of Qiang Dofu's guerrilla team behind enemy lines in the newspaper. The guerrillas blew up bridges, dispersed enemy convoys, killed camping American soldiers with knives, and no one in South Korea could compare with his heroic ability to strike.

　　人民的复仇者
    波诚科
    真理报平壤通讯
    南朝鲜的农民们，站在家门口，一边抽着烟，一边满意地注视着公路上扬起的灰尘。可恨的李承晚的及美国的军队正在向南奔跑。农民们看见地主的新房子门口——这所房子的围墙是石头的，象一座庙——停下了两辆汽车，肥胖的地主匆忙地帮着仆人们把皮箱装上汽车。这个恶汉的傲慢和威风哪儿去了！那种东西，他从前连手指都不去摸一下，现在他却象一个搬运夫似的背在肩上了。
    “显然，他烦恼极了，”年老的强都富说，他有许多儿女，孙子更多。
    老头儿憎恨着地主，所以他现在高兴地看着——敌人的落魄情况。对地主的债务，象蜘蛛网一样绷住当地的全体农民。为了租地、使用木犁、使用硗瘠的田地上的耕牛，农民非欠他的债不可。他招呼农民来帮他，但是大家却装作没有听见。
    坐在载重汽车司机座旁的地主，当汽车开过农民前面时，高傲地向他们看一眼，吩咐他们保护他的房子，提醒他们，要把租种的田地上的收获的四分之三好好保存着。
    地主走了。不多久出现了一个醉醺醺的美国伍长，把写着朝鲜文的命令贴到墙上。从不识字的农民中间找出一个能读的人来，叫他把命令读一遍。命令上写着凡是不跟美军一同到南方去的朝鲜人，一律处决。伍长还做了一个意味深长的手势，表演怎样用大斧砍掉头颅。
    强都富用力吸了一口烟，向本村的人们说，趁着现在天色还早，应该收拾收拾到山里去。亲爱的故乡的山岭是能够挽救生活上所发生的一切事变的。
    当天夜里，强都富领导着全村居民，随带粮食到山里去，远离美国兵日夜不停地走过的可怕的公路。山冈上，老头儿派了一个巡哨。后来巡哨向老头儿报告，人民军已经进了村庄。
    人们都回家了。在强都富的门口，有一辆盖着新鲜树枝的大型坦克，兵士们在坦克周围忙着，其中有一个蹲着的人忽然跳起身来，张着两手向老头儿跟前走过来说：
    “你好吧，爸爸！”
    老头儿好容易才认出这个被阳光晒得红红的强壮的人就是自己的大儿子昌武。八年前，那儿子抛下了妻子和孩子们到北方去找工作。他进了兴南一个化学工厂当杂役。那个工厂生产着数万吨化学肥料，但是连最后一公分都运到日本去，而让朝鲜的土地很久以来一直用雇农的咸味的血汗来施肥和灌溉。昌武在兴南过着贫穷生活，但是也还比父亲和小儿子们及兄弟们的生活好些。不久二弟也去了，最小的弟弟到了成年，也去他那里了。
    从那时起发生了许多变化。苏联军队粉碎了日本占领者，但是没有来到强都富这一大家人所居住的村庄。三八线象刀子一样把朝鲜分成了两部分，把许多家庭也分成了两半。时常是丈夫在一方，而妻子儿女却在另一方。强都富失去了儿子们，失去了老年的倚靠。有一次，他步行着去找他们，但是走到这一条可诅咒的纬线，宪兵却不再放他前行了。
    强都富回到村庄。美国人接替了日本人，但是在农民的生活中却什么都没有改变。仍然是那个地主出租贫瘠的土地，而征收四分之三的谷物作地租。结果粮食不够养活一家。
    现在什么都没有了。没有日本人，没有美国人，没有地主也没有警察，从童年到老年迫害着强都富的这个恶梦没有了，站在他面前的是宽肩膀上带着金色军官肩章的儿子——这个强有力的坦克的主人。
    昌武发出了带有感染性的接连好一会的高兴的笑声。他离开本村时原是一个文盲，现在却把金日成的演说读给父亲听，告诉本村的人们关于人民委员会，土地改革及北朝鲜的光明而愉快的生活。农民们知道自己及祖先们几百年来的梦想，终于实现了。从地主手中租来的这些田地，人民政权要永远给予他们；幸福降临到他们黑暗阴郁的生活中。他们也明白，应该手执武器去保卫这个幸福，因为敌人方面想剥夺他们幸福的阴谋还有很多。
    战争时期的相会是短暂的。昌武又出发到南方去了，那里进行着惨酷的战斗。谁也没有想阻止他。当祖国遇到危险的时候，男子的责任就是做军人。
    不久政府的代表来了，都是些普通工人。他们召集了会议——第一次大会，你在会上什么话都可以说出来。强都富被本村人一致选为村人民委员会主席。
    和政府代表一齐来的有一个年青女子，她是教员；她就在地主的房子里开办了初级小学，三个乡村共设一个学校。强都富的孙子们第一次有了求学的机会。
    地主在山坡上的梯田，都分配给农民了。强都富在六十年的生涯中初次成了土地的主人，这些土地足够养活他这一大家人了。他已经能够自己支配所收获的粮食。
    九月一日孩子们上了学校——地主的房子，从前不敢走近的地方。孩子们静静地坐在桌子后边，从平壤来的年青的女教师开始教他们认字。
    和平与宁静笼罩着村庄。和煦的阳光照耀着，稻穗上丰满的稻粒成熟了。但是幸福却不长久。村庄解放后两星期，美国轰炸机飞来了，在空中兜了几个圈子，开始轰炸芦苇的草房。一枚大炸弹落到了学校。强都富看见象血一样向上奔腾的火焰，看见空中旋转着的木屑，他因苦痛和恐怖而心碎了。他跑到学校，门槛上躺着被炸死的女教师，好象她曾经企图以自己的身子，来掩护那些血肉横飞的男女孩子们。
    活着的孩子们从冒烟的废墟中跳出来，就向所看到的一条大路跑去。他们已吓聋了，听不见老头儿的喊声。原来老头儿叫他们停住，因为看见了从小山那边飞机又直冲过来，飞行员们飞着，象旋风一样，机枪象割草一样射击那些吓得要死的孩子们。
    这个景象是老头儿在这漫长的一生中所看到的最可怕的事。丧失了孩子的母亲们疯狂了，她们在自己房屋的灰烬上徘徊着，用手掏摸那些火热的灰烬，而不感到痛楚，时而还苦笑一下。黑烟象送丧的一样飘荡在天空，一直到晚，凶手们都在天空飞翔着，赏玩自己的罪行。
    强都富这么一个大家庭，只剩下了两个男孩——做坦克手的大儿子的孩子。痛苦没有使老头儿沮丧，反而教训了他。他变得更加活动更加热情了，他尽可能更多地支援前线。本村中的男子剩得不多。大多数都和人民军的队伍一同走了，一切工作需要妇女们来承担。
    强都富叫大家动手盖屋，在山脚下小河边很快就盖起了十几间小屋，失掉财产和房屋的人们到这里来住。许许多多的请求向强都富提出来。人们甚至从邻村赶来求他帮助或想办法。他身边出现了许多必须独自立即解决的事情。居民们送来给军队的慰劳品，就须立刻送到指定地点去。
    在南方，日日夜夜响着隆隆的炮声。
    前线离得不远，应该准备万一呢——老头儿这样想。他眼前浮现了那个扬言还要回来的可憎的地主。这个人民委员会主席就在山脊后边，人迹罕到的地方秘密地建造了食粮储藏所。他号召大家把沿公路附近美国人所抛掉的武器和军火收集起来，运到山里去。
    又过了十天，炮声并没有向前移动，老头儿明白前线是处在停滞状态。然后传来了坏消息，美国人在后方向汉城进攻了。
    收割期来到了。农民们整天在田地里。强都富催促着人们收割，无论如何不要把割下来的稻子放在田里，要运到山中去。割稻子不得不在夜间进行，因为在白天飞机射击在工作的农民。
    不久，公路上出现了向北走的人民军队伍。按照总司令部的命令，他们要转移到、早已准备好的新防线去。坦克手们和昌武也到了。军官邀父亲一同走，老人断然拒绝了。他无论如何也不能离开亲爱的家乡、抛掉居民，他要和大家一齐到山里去。
    “亲爱的故乡的山岭是能够挽救灾祸的，”强都富在他和儿子分手时说。
    过了几天，昌武在报上读到了强都富的敌后游击队的英勇活动。游击队炸了桥梁，打散了敌人汽车队，用刀杀了宿营的美国兵，英勇出击的本领，在南朝鲜是谁也不能与他相比的。（君强译自十月九日真理报）
