Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd: An historically significant "Nationalities' Get-Together" was held today at the Temple of Agriculture in Beijing. Attending the get-together were representatives of various ethnic groups and ethnic minority cultural workers who came to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations, leading figures and cadres from various organs of the Central People's Government, democratic parties, and people's organizations, commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, representatives of workers, students, citizens, and people of all ethnic groups in Beijing, totaling more than 31,000 people. A huge portrait of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China, stood tall on the rostrum. Surrounding the rostrum were countless red flags and slogans written in sixteen ethnic minority languages, including Han, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Uyghur, Yi, Lolo, Hani, Manchu, Russian, Thai, Buyi, Sani, Nu, Kawa, and Korean: "Unite, all ethnic groups of the People's Republic of China!"

The get-together began at 11:00 a.m. with the solemn sound of the national anthem. Ulanhu, Vice Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government, first led the representatives of various ethnic groups from Inner Mongolia, the Northwest, the Southwest, the Central South, East China, the Northeast, and provinces and cities directly under the Central Government, as well as ethnic minority cultural troupes, the Central Academy of Drama, the China Youth Art Theatre, and the North China Military Region Cultural Troupe, around the venue, led by a band. This was followed by a speech by Li Weihan, Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government. He first pointed out that the representatives of forty-three ethnic groups who are attending today's national nationalities' get-together have come to the capital from all over the country, from the distant borders of the motherland. This is a great and new event that has never happened and could not have happened in thousands of years of history. The reason why this great event could occur is all due to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the great leader of our people of all ethnic groups. He hoped that the representatives of various ethnic groups and ethnic minority cultural troupes would bring the spirit of unity and friendship that was fostered in Beijing and at today's nationalities' get-together to every corner of the country and carry it forward. Finally, he called on people of all ethnic groups to unite closely under the banner of Mao Zedong and strive to eliminate the remnants of counter-revolutionaries, smash the aggressive conspiracies of the aggressive bloc headed by US imperialism, and strive for the common happiness and development of the people of all ethnic groups.

After the adoption of a message of respect to Chairman Mao (to be issued separately) in a solemn ceremony, the Southwest Nationalities Cultural Troupe, the Xinjiang Cultural Troupe, the Korean-Chinese Yanbian Cultural Troupe of Jilin Province in the Northeast, the Northwest Ethnic Minority Literary and Art Workers Visiting Group, the Inner Mongolia Cultural Troupe, the China Youth Art Theatre, the North China Military Region Cultural Troupe, the Beijing People's Art Theatre, the Central Academy of Drama Dance Troupe, the China Acrobatic Troupe, and others performed wonderful programs of various ethnic forms. The get-together continued for four and a half hours in a friendly and warm atmosphere, and ended successfully at 3:30 p.m.
