　　After the Korean People's Army Voluntarily Withdrew Northward
    US Imperialists Fell Deeper into the Quagmire
    Still Worried About the Future of the War of Aggression
    [Xinhua News Agency, 2nd] The General Headquarters of the Korean Democratic People's Republic announced on October 1st that the People's Army had been systematically withdrawn to new positions in the north.
    This initiative of the Korean People's Army to withdraw from the south in a planned way has deeply confused and worried the American aggressors. On the one hand, the American aggressors were dizzy with so-called "victory," and the war of aggression against Korea suddenly "changed from excessive pessimism to excessive optimism" (The Times). On the other hand, they also realized that they were more deeply mired in a long-term war of aggression and were restless.
    An Associated Press dispatch from Jordon on September 26 from the headquarters of the US Eighth Army on the southern Korean front explained that the so-called "victorious advance" of the US military was actually just a voluntary and planned retreat by the People's Army. Jordon wrote: "The communists fought a very clever and fierce delaying action. On this line, the US 25th, 2nd, and 24th Divisions paid a heavy price for every mile of land they seized from the communists. ... Indeed, the reason why the First Cavalry Division and the Seventh Division were able to meet twenty-five miles south of Seoul last night was only because the North Korean army did not resist the spearhead of the US army. ... The same is true along the line of the Republic of Korea's defense zone. ... The communists are fighting what a spokesman called "a brilliant tactical retreat." Then, Jordon wrote: "In fact, the major question raised in the past twelve days is: Where did the enemy go? The most reliable people here frankly say that even they don't know. Front-line observers and air force personnel said that the retreat of the communists puzzled even the most well-informed people here. The enemy's future plans are equally confusing. ... While the US and South Korean troops launched an offensive, the North Korean troops were also taking action."
    Although Jordon said that "everyone is optimistic" when talking about the future of the US aggression against Korea, he immediately expressed the fears of the US aggressors. He wrote: "However, those who understand the military situation in Korea the most do not think that the war is over. The American soldiers who are fighting in Korea and may die on the battlefield do not think so either. The communists are the most dangerous and determined enemy. They have small groups of troops distributed everywhere and behind the US army. ... The small red dots on the intelligence map representing enemy guerrillas are scattered throughout South Korea." Jordon finally wrote that the "conclusion" reached by the American aggressors on the southern Korean front was: "The Korean War is far from over."
    At the same time, The Times, the organ of the British Conservative Party, also expressed great concern about the US aggressors being mired in a long-term war of aggression. The newspaper wrote: "Modern warfare conducted in countries like Korea... has never involved such a large number of the most modern fleets, numerous air forces, and tens of thousands of ground troops. This war is a brutal and risky experiment that could dangerously drain the peacetime resources of the world's largest power. ... London, Washington, and Paris are fully aware of this."

### 朝鲜人民军主动北撤后  美帝陷入更深泥沼  对侵略战争前途仍感忧虑

　　朝鲜人民军主动北撤后
    美帝陷入更深泥沼
    对侵略战争前途仍感忧虑
    【新华社二日讯】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部十月一日公布人民军已有组织地撤入北方新阵地。
    朝鲜人民军此次主动有计划地自南方撤退，使美国侵略者深为迷惑与忧虑。美国侵略者一方面被所谓“胜利”冲昏了头脑，对侵朝战争忽然“从过份的悲观转到过份的乐观”（泰晤士报），但另一方面也认识到它自己更深地陷入了长期侵略战争的泥沼，而局促不安。
    美联社记者鸠顿九月二十六日从朝鲜南部前线美军第八军总部发出的电讯，说明了所谓美军的“胜利推进”，原来不过是人民军主动有计划的撤退。鸠顿写道：“共军打了一个很灵巧的、而且很狂烈的阻宕战。在这一线上，美军第二十五、第二及第二十四师，从共军方面夺得每一英里的土地时都付出了重大代价。……的确，第一骑兵师与第七师昨夜在汉城以南二十五英里处会师之所以可能，只是因为北朝鲜军并没有抵抗美军的矛头罢了。……在大韩民国防区的沿线，也都有同样情形。……共军正在打着一位发言人称之为“一个辉煌的战术上撤退”的仗。”接着，鸠顿写道：“实际上，过去十二天中所引起的重大问题是：敌人究竟跑到那里去了？此间现有的最可靠人士坦白地说，连他们也不知道。前线观察员与空军人士称，共军的撤退使此间消息最灵通的人们迷感不解。至于敌人将来的计划如何，也同样令人迷乱。……在美军与南朝鲜军队发动进攻的同时，北朝鲜军队也在行动。”
    鸠顿在谈到美军侵略朝鲜的前途时虽然说“人人表示乐观”，但是，他却紧接着说出美国侵略者的疑惧。他写道：“然而，最了解朝鲜军事形势的人们，无论如何并不认为战争已经结束。在朝鲜作战并且可能战死疆场的美国兵士们，也不认为如此。共军是最危险最坚决的敌人。他们在各处以及美军后方都有小批部队分布着。……情报地图上代表敌人游击队的小红点，散布在整个南朝鲜。”鸠顿最后写道：在朝鲜南部前线的美国侵略者所获的“结论”是：“朝鲜战争离结束之期还远得很”。
    同时，英国保守党机关报泰晤士报对于美国侵略者陷入长期侵略战争的泥沼，也表示十分忧虑。该报写道：“象在朝鲜这样的国家里所进行的现代化战争，……从没有牵涉这样大批的最现代化的舰队，众多的空军以及数以万计的地面部队。这次战争是一次残酷与冒险的实验，它可以危险地吸干世界最大强国的平时资源。……伦敦华盛顿与巴黎，都已彻底认识到了这一点”。（英新处伦敦九月二十五日电）
