Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 20th. According to TASS: The Preparatory Committee of the Second World Peace Congress held a meeting in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, from the 16th to the 18th. The meeting issued a statement saying: The Preparatory Committee notes with great satisfaction the preparations for the successful holding of the Second World Peace Congress, which will soon be held in the Sheffield City Hall in the United Kingdom. The Preparatory Committee thanks the British Peace Committee for its work in ensuring the smooth holding of the Congress and urges the National Peace Committees to quickly select and send representatives to the Congress.

The statement continued: The Preparatory Committee listened to reports from representatives of various countries, which fully demonstrated that the call issued by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress to convene the Second World Peace Congress, and the peace proposals put forward therein, have received strong support from the people of various countries. More people and prominent politicians, scientists, artists, clergy, and industrialists who are participating in discussions related to the defense of world peace have continued to join the ranks of defending peace. They are concerned not only with demands for disarmament, condemnation of acts of aggression, and prohibition of war propaganda, but also with the peaceful resolution of current conflicts and the restoration of economic and cultural exchanges between countries. These issues are of great importance to the vast majority of people in all countries, whether or not they have already participated in the peace movement. Efforts to resolve these issues will more broadly unite those who regard peace as the most precious asset of mankind.

The statement continued: The Preparatory Committee reviewed the agenda of the Second World Peace Congress and decided to submit recommendations to the Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. The Preparatory Committee once again called on the National Peace Committees to ensure that all people who are willing to participate in the formulation of effective peace regulations can actively participate in the preparation of the Peace Congress and the selection of delegations.

The statement concluded: At a time when mankind is concerned about the dangers they face, the convening of the Second World Peace Congress will bring hope to mankind and demonstrate that the unity of the people around the world who are determined to uphold peace is growing day by day.
