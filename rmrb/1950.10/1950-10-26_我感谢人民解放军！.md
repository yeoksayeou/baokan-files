People's Garden

　　I thank the People's Liberation Army!
    I live in Xiaogao Village, Sixth District, Tong County, Hebei Province, and have five acres of land. I am already sixty-two years old, and my physical strength is not good, making harvesting difficult. I watched as the soybean pods on the ground continued to crack and fall off. Just then, three comrades from the People's Liberation Army, Sun Zhiyi, Ren Baohua, and Zhou Lizong, were cutting grass nearby. They saw that my family lacked labor and immediately volunteered to help me harvest. I am truly grateful to the People's Liberation Army!

　　我感谢人民解放军！
    我家住河北通县六区小稿村，有土地五亩。我已六十二岁了，体力不好，收割困难，眼看着黄豆荚在地里不断开裂脱落。恰好这时有人民解放军战士孙志毅、任宝华、周立宗三同志在附近割草。他们看见我家缺乏劳动力，立刻自动帮助我收割。我真感谢人民解放军！
