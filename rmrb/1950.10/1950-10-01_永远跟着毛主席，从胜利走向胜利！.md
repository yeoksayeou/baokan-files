　　Always Follow Chairman Mao, Marching from Victory to Victory!
　　Model Medical Worker of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army: Li Lanting
　　Last year on this day, I participated in the CPPCC meeting and the founding ceremony. This year, I am again in Chairman Mao's location, the people's capital—Beijing, and together with combat heroes from the border regions, the navy, army, and air force, national model workers, and international friends, jointly celebrating this great first National Day. How glorious and exciting!
　　Here, I have seen that our strength is increasing rapidly, and the wealth of our motherland is also increasing rapidly. The lives of the peasants have been improving day by day after they were distributed land, and scientific health work has begun to serve the broad masses of the people. All of this is due to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao. We are truly fortunate to be born in the great era of Mao Zedong. We have been educated by the Party and Mao Zedong Thought, transforming us from impoverished workers, peasants, and students into people's heroes and models, enabling us to contribute to the people.
　　All of this that brings happiness to our peace-loving people, and is cheered by our peace-loving people, is what the blood-sucking imperialists are envious and trembling about. We have already seen the ugly drama of the US imperialists' armed aggression against Korea and Taiwan, bombing of Andong and its Chenggong Lake, etc. Isn't this series of provocative acts of aggression enough to illustrate their aggressive nature? We should firmly remember Chairman Mao's words: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never be reconciled to their defeat..." Therefore, when the whole country is celebrating National Day, we must not neglect the active and thorough preparation for the liberation of Taiwan and Tibet. I guarantee that wherever there is war, I will go there, and do a good job in the health care of the troops, so that our army will become a heroic army that is strong, brave, and ever-victorious. Let all aggressors and war provocateurs die before us. We resolutely defend our motherland and defend world peace. We will always follow Chairman Mao, marching from victory to victory!

　　永远跟着毛主席，从胜利走向胜利！
    华东军区、三野部队模范医务工作者  李蓝丁
    去年今日，我参加了人民政协会议和开国大典。今年我又在毛主席的所在地、人民的首都——北京，和来自祖国边疆的海陆空军的战斗英雄们、全国劳动模范们、国际友人们，共同欢度这个伟大的第一个国庆节，是多么光荣和使人激动啊！
    在这里，我看到了我们的力量是在飞速地增强，我们祖国的财富也飞速地增加，农民分得了土地后生活是在一天天改善了，科学的卫生工作已开始为广大人民服务，这都是由于毛主席的英明领导所致。我们生长在伟大的毛泽东的年代里真是幸福。我们受到了党和毛泽东思想的教养，把我们从贫困的工人、农民、学生，培养成为人民的英雄和模范，而能对人民有所贡献。
    这一切使我们和平人民幸福的，为我们和平人民所欢呼的，正是靠吃人为生的帝国主义者所眼红发抖的。我们已看到美帝国主义者武装侵略朝鲜、台湾，轰炸安东及其在成功湖的丑剧等等，这一连串的侵略战争的挑衅行为，难道还不够说明他的侵略本质吗？我们应牢记毛主席曾说过的“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败……”这句话。因此当在这举国欢庆国庆的时候，我们决不忽略积极周密准备解放台湾西藏的工作。我保证那里有战争我就到那里去，并做好部队的保健工作，使我们的军队成为一支兵强马壮，百战百胜的英雄军队。让一切侵略战争的挑衅者在我们面前死亡。我们坚决地保卫祖国和保卫世界和平，我们永远跟着毛主席从胜利走向胜利！
