Forever Follow Chairman Mao
Reporter

The People's Army Personally Cultivated by Chairman Mao

October 1, 1950, was a great day of jubilation for the people of China and the world. On this day, a grand review of more than 400,000 soldiers and civilians was held in the capital of China. The review itself eloquently proved the following truth with vivid and typical facts: In the past, the people of the whole country followed Chairman Mao and achieved such a great victory today. In the future, as long as we forever follow Chairman Mao, we will surely achieve even greater victories.

At 11 a.m., a huge salute of guns rumbled from the east of Tiananmen Square. The review of the powerful People's Armed Forces began. The forces reviewed on this sun-drenched People's Square included the Air Force, Navy, Army, tanks, howitzers, mountain artillery, anti-aircraft guns, cavalry units, and motorized units. This is the result of 23 years of heroic struggle by the Chinese people. Everyone is proud to have such a powerful army and firmly believes in a happy future. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu repeatedly waved in acknowledgement as they reviewed the great People's Army they had personally cultivated from atop Tiananmen Gate. Representatives of the thirty-six fraternal ethnic groups in the country jumped for joy upon seeing the planes and tanks. Foreign envoys and world youth representatives on the reviewing stand applauded and cheered repeatedly. As people watched the heroic bearing of each unit under review, they recalled the difficult years when Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu met at Jinggangshan. At that time, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was just a guerrilla force of less than 6,000 people, but under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, it not only defeated the reactionary forces at home and abroad and liberated all the territories except Taiwan and Tibet, but also seized the enemy's weapons and equipped itself. The history of the development of the Chinese People's Liberation Army brilliantly proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's military line. At the same time, the history of the development of the Chinese People's Liberation Army assures the people of the whole country and declares to the world's peace threateners: If American imperialism dares to invade our sacred motherland, it will inevitably repeat the more tragic failures suffered by the Chiang bandits and Japanese imperialism.

The Result of Chairman Mao's Wise Leadership

The majestic ranks of the powerful People's Army passed through Tiananmen Square, and a torrent of 200,000 labor troops – workers' and farmers' teams – surged out of the three gate openings east of Tiananmen. They held aloft tens of thousands of portraits of Chairman Mao, Marshal Stalin, and the leaders of various countries. On the wooden placards held by the railway workers, their labor achievements were clearly written. This year, railway transportation efficiency has increased by 50% compared to last year. A total of 21,742 kilometers of railways have been opened to traffic nationwide. The workers of the Shijingshan Power Plant carried the blueprints of the No. 6 generator, excitedly looking at Chairman Mao, because they worked hard day and night to repair the No. 6 generator, ensuring the electricity supply to the people's capital. Like the railway workers, the coal miners have made exciting contributions in the creative labor of building the motherland: the total output of state-owned coal mines has increased by more than 37% compared to last year.

The farmers in the suburbs of Beijing, after the implementation of land reform, wore neat clothes for the first time. They were particularly grateful to Chairman Mao. When the parade marched to the rostrum, they raised their hands and cheered for a long time. Seeing that Chairman Mao was in good health, they repeatedly said, "We can rest assured now!" Students from agricultural universities held up plump rice and snow-white cotton, symbolizing the harvest of the motherland. This year, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, they overcame various disasters and achieved bumper harvests in both summer and autumn. The output of both grain and cotton has exceeded the original plan, with grain production increasing by 20 billion catties and cotton by 5.2 million dan compared to last year.

These great achievements in industrial and agricultural production, as the national labor model representatives said, "are the result of Chairman Mao's wise leadership."

The People Love Their Leader

The torrent of jubilant crowds flowing turbulently from east to west across Tiananmen Square included workers, staff, farmers, students, government employees, and citizens. As this surging westward flow of people flowed from the three gate openings east of Tiananmen towards Tiananmen Square, it stirred up a huge sound. Hundreds of thousands of people shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" Happy Young Pioneers, seeing Chairman Mao, jumped up and down, throwing flowers in their hands, and raising hundreds of paper doves and hundreds of paper torches into the sky. Teams of housewives quietly and anxiously asked each other, "Where is Chairman Mao?" A citizen lifted his child, and the child jumped in his father's arms, waving to Tiananmen. On Tiananmen, Chairman Mao frequently waved his right hand to greet the cheering crowds. Although the leaders repeatedly urged him on, the crowds still lingered. An old lady from District One righteously complained to the leaders: "You are young men, I am so old, if I don't see Chairman Mao now, when will I be able to see him?" An old man in his seventies left the team, ran towards the Yuhe Bridge, waved his hat and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" On the reviewing stand, representatives of ethnic minorities made such touching remarks: "The people love their leader so much, and the leader respects the people so much, truly a people's leader!"

Unite Around Chairman Mao

On the reviewing stands on both sides of Tiananmen Square sat members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, representatives of various democratic parties, representatives of various fraternal ethnic groups, representatives of national combat heroes, and representatives of labor models. This is the atmosphere of great unity of the Chinese people. Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us: As long as we adhere to the people's democratic dictatorship and unite international friends, we will always be victorious. Today, when the people are reviewing their own strength, all the democratic parties in the country jointly presented Chairman Mao with a banner, which read: "Forever follow you." This sentence profoundly summarizes the experience of the Chinese revolution and points out the path for the Chinese people to continue to move forward in the future.

Chairman Mao is the Common Leader of All Ethnic Groups

The ranks of ethnic minority representatives show a microcosm of the friendly unity of all ethnic groups in the new China. Under the green "Star and Crescent" flag, more than 4,000 Hui people passed by; Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and Tatars from both sides of the Tianshan Mountains, Hui and Tibetans from the Gansu and Qinghai Plateaus, Mongolians from Suiyuan, and representatives of 36 ethnic groups such as Miao, Yao, Li, Yi, and Mosuo from the southwestern border of the motherland, each wearing their festive costumes, playing the music of their respective ethnic groups, singing and dancing, like a pile of colorful clouds moving across the square. These people who have suffered from the exploitation, plunder, and contempt of the reactionaries for many years are today welcomed and respected by the people of all walks of life in the capital. Seeing Chairman Mao waving to them kindly, they feel the happiness of living in a harmonious family of the Chinese nation. Uyghur representative Abulizi said: "The two different situations in the past and present make me realize that the country led by Chairman Mao is the common country of all our ethnic groups, and Chairman Mao is the common leader of all ethnic groups."

Strive to Build and Defend Our Happier Life Under the Leadership of Chairman Mao!

The Chinese people have made achievements in the past year that have not been seen in hundreds of years. Today, more than 400,000 organized people from all walks of life and all ethnic groups, united as one, in Tiananmen Square, express the will of 475 million people to Chairman Mao: They will strive to build and defend their happier life under the leadership of Chairman Mao!

    永远跟着毛主席走
    记者
    毛主席亲自培植的人民军队
    一九五○年十月一日，是全中国和全世界人民欢欣鼓舞的一个伟大的日子。在这天，中国人民首都举行了四十余万军民的大检阅。这个检阅的本身用生动的、典型的事实雄辩地证明了这样一个真理：过去，全国人民跟着毛主席走，取得了今天这样伟大的胜利，今后，只要我们永远跟着毛主席走，我们就一定能够得到更伟大的胜利。
    上午十一时，从天安门的东方轰然发出巨大的礼炮声响。强大的人民武装部队检阅开始了。在这阳光照耀着的人民广场上受检阅的包括空军、海军、陆军、坦克、榴弹炮、山野炮、高射炮、骑兵部队和摩托化部队。这是中国人民二十三年来英勇奋斗的结果。每一个人都以有这样的强大军队而感到骄傲，并坚信着幸福的将来。毛主席、朱总司令，在天安门楼上检阅了亲自培植起来的伟大的人民军队时，频频挥手答礼。国内三十六个兄弟民族代表看见飞机和坦克，都欢欣地跳跃起来。观礼台上的各国使节和世界青年代表一再地鼓掌、欢呼。当人们注视着每个受检阅的部队的英雄姿态时，回想起那艰苦的年月，毛主席和朱总司令在井岗山会师时，中国工农红军还只是一支不到六千人的游击队，但它在毛主席正确的领导下，不仅击败了国内外反动派，解放了除台湾、西藏外的全部国土，而且夺取了敌人的武器，装备了自己。中国人民解放军发展的历史，光辉地证明了毛主席军事路线的正确。同时，中国人民解放军发展的历史向全国人民保证，向世界和平威胁者宣告：如果美帝国主义胆敢侵略我们神圣的祖国，它就必然重复蒋匪和日本帝国主义所遭受更惨重的失败。
    毛主席英明领导的结果
    强大人民军队的雄伟行列，穿过了天安门广场，天安门东三座门的门洞口又汹涌地流来了二十万人的劳动大军——工人、农民队伍的激流。他们高举着数以万计的毛主席、斯大林大元帅和各国人民领袖的画像。铁路工人擎着的木牌上，鲜明地写着他们的劳动成绩。今年铁道运输效率比去年提高百分之五十。全国铁路已有二万一千七百四十二公里通车了。石景山发电厂的工人们抬着六号发电机的图样，兴奋地望着毛主席，因为他们日日夜夜艰辛工作，把六号发电机修好，保证了人民首都的用电。煤矿工人们和铁路工人一样，在建设祖国的创造性的劳动中，作出了令人兴奋的贡献：国营煤矿的总产量已比去年增产百分之三十七以上。
    实行土地改革以后的京郊农民，头一次穿上了整齐的衣服。他们特别感激毛主席。游行的队伍行进到主席台时，长时间举手欢呼，他们看见毛主席身体健康，连说：“咱这就放心啦！”农业大学的学生们举着肥硕的稻谷和雪白的棉花，象征着祖国的丰收。今年在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，战胜了各种灾害，取得了夏、秋两季的丰收，棉粮均已超过原订计划，较去年增产粮二百亿斤和棉花五百二十万担。
    这些工农业生产的巨大成绩，正如全国劳模代表所说：“是毛主席英明领导的结果”。
    人民热爱自己的领袖
    天安门广场从东向西激湍地流着的狂欢的人群的激流，包括了工人、职员、农民、学生、机关工作人员和市民。这支汹涌西流的人流，从东三座门流向天安门前时，激起了巨大的音响。几十万个人狂呼着“毛主席万岁”。幸福的少年儿童队员们，看到毛主席时，跳跃着抛掷手中的鲜花，把千百只纸鸽子，千百根纸火炬，举向了天空。成队的家庭妇女轻声而急躁地互相询问着“哪是毛主席”。一位市民举起了他的孩子，孩子在父亲的怀抱里跳跃着向天安门招手。在天安门上，毛主席频频扬着右手，向欢呼的群众致意。虽然领队的同志一再催他，群众的队伍依然迟迟不进，一区的一位老太太理直气壮地埋怨领队同志：“你们是年轻小伙子，我年纪这么大了，再不看看毛主席，几时能见到他呢？”一位七十多岁的老人，离开队伍，奔向御河桥头，挥舞着帽子欢呼“毛主席万岁”。在观礼台上，少数民族的代表，发出了这样感动的声音：“人民这样热爱领袖，领袖这样尊重人民，真是人民的领袖！”
    团结在毛主席周围
    在天安门前两旁的观礼台上，坐着中国人民政协全国委员会的委员、各民主党派、各兄弟民族代表、全国战斗英雄代表和劳动模范代表。这是中国人民大团结的气象。毛主席曾经一再教导我们：只要我们坚持人民民主专政和团结国际友人，我们就会是永远胜利的。今天，当人民检阅自己的力量的时候，全国各民主党派联名向毛主席献上了一面锦旗，上面写着：“永远跟着你走”。这句话深刻地总结了中国革命的经验，指明了中国人民今后继续前进的道路。
    毛主席是各民族共同的领袖
    少数民族代表的行列，显现出新中国各民族友好团结的缩影。绿色“星月”旗下，四千多名回民过去了；来自天山南北的维吾尔族、哈萨哥族、塔塔尔族，来自甘（肃）、青（海）高原的回族、藏族，来自绥远的蒙族，来自祖国西南边疆的苗、徭、黎族、彝族，摩些族等三十六族的代表，各自穿戴着他们节日的服饰，奏着各民族的乐曲，边歌边舞，像一堆彩云移过广场。这些多年来遭受反动派压榨、抢掠与鄙视的人们，今天，他们受到了首都各界人民的欢迎与尊重，看到毛主席向他们亲切的招手，他们感到生活在中华民族和睦的大家庭中的幸福。维吾尔族代表阿不列斯说：“过去和现在两种不同的境遇，使我认识到毛主席领导的国家，是我们各民族共同的国家，毛主席是各民族共同的领袖。”
    要在毛主席的领导下，为建设和保卫自己更幸福的生活而斗争！
    中国人民在过去一年中已经做出了几百年来不曾有过的成绩；今天，天安门广场四十余万有组织的各阶层、各民族团结一致的群众，更在毛主席面前表达出了四万七千五百万人民的意志：他们将在毛主席的领导下，为建设和保卫自己更幸福的生活而斗争！
