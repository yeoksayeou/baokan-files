Examining Cadres' Mass Perspective Through the Handling of Three Flood Control Issues

During our inspection and assistance in flood control work in Xian County and Hejian, we observed three different attitudes adopted by leaders in handling three issues, which elicited three different responses from the masses. This has given us a deeper understanding of the mass perspective.

I. Three Different Situations

(1) Separation from the People. The six villages of Xifan Village, Xidaguo Village, Pangding Village, Nanbeiliche Village, and Guliuzhuang in Xian County are located east of the Fuyang River and north of the Great Wall Dike. If the Great Wall Dike were to breach, not only would these six villages be affected, but also the vast area in northern Wuqiang. However, the party and government leaders of Xian County adopted an irresponsible, bureaucratic attitude, ignoring the situation and harboring the idea that "it doesn't matter if six villages are flooded," feeling that "we can't even take care of our side (the right bank of the Fuyang River), how can we have the strength to take care of the other side?" Therefore, they did not manage the dike sections belonging to these six villages; they even refused to resolve the expenses needed for the masses to organize themselves to repair the dikes and protect the banks, which should have been resolved. Seeing that the county and district cadres of the dike sections belonging to neighboring Wuqiang were personally directing the work, and that all flood control expenses were resolved by the government, and that some villages in the county area on the east bank of the Fuyang River were also preparing flood control materials, the masses of the six villages were very dissatisfied in comparison: "The county doesn't want our six villages anymore, let's ask to be assigned to Wuqiang." They also formally proposed to the district cadres, requesting the county head to assign these villages to Wuqiang.

(2) The Masses Both Complain and Express Gratitude. The Beisituquanzi Dike in Hejian County, due to the 麻痹 numbness and negligence of the county and district leaders, suffered a breach to the east of the village on August 19th, submerging over ten thousand mu of farmland and causing serious disaster. This also caused the dike to face the flood directly, with continuous collapses and leaks, creating a critical situation. After the county leadership discovered this, they immediately ordered all county and district cadres to lead efforts, with direct guidance from the special district, and with the efforts of the broad masses, they quickly completed the entire eighteen-li-long flood control project, safely passed the dangerous period, and protected the lives and property of the broad masses. Therefore, although the masses were dissatisfied with the breach of the Zi Dike, they were very grateful to all the county and district cadres for their efforts in leading the protection of the main dike. They said, "If it weren't for the leadership of the higher authorities, the main dike could not have been saved."

(3) Closely Connected with the Masses. The seven villages in Xuzhaoquan, Xian County, share over 20,000 mu of land. In the past, due to inadequate protection of the Zi Dike, they were flooded for two consecutive years. Therefore, the masses suffered hardships, complained about the government, and were in opposition to the government. In response to this situation, the party and government leaders helped Xian County to examine the situation of mastering the Zi Dike policy and researched effective measures. And immediately sent cadres to Zi Dike villages to convene cadre and mass meetings, repeatedly and specifically explaining the policy. Explain the basic principles that minor interests are subordinate to major interests, and major interests take care of minor interests; explain that under the condition that the main dike can still be protected, the government will try its best to protect the Zi Dike from breaching; if it affects the consolidation and safety of the main dike, it is necessary to abandon the Zi Dike to protect the main dike. Also, according to the regulations of the Ziya River Affairs Bureau, and specifically clarified to the masses: now the water level at Zangqiao is 17.03 meters, and at Shaheqiao it is 15.88 meters. If the upstream water rises again or encounters strong winds, the consolidation of the main dike will be affected, and the Zi Dike should be abandoned. The leading cadres signed a contract with the masses based on this principle, guaranteeing to abide by it. At the same time, the Zi Dike was surveyed, and forces were organized to repair the dangerous works. Cadres went deep into inspection and patrol. During the rainstorm on the evening of August 20, the district cadres went to inspect the dikes and guide protection in the rain; the masses expressed satisfaction, saying, "What else can we say like this? Anyway, we can't let 500 qing be flooded and leave 50 qing, it's always right to flood less than to flood more." Seeing that we were truly enthusiastic and responsible for them in action, the masses changed their two-year-long doubts about the government and their opposing ideas, realized the correctness of the government's policies, expressed warm support, and thus closely linked the party and the government with the people.

II. What Problems Exist in the Leading Organs?

From the above three problems, our leading organs have the following two very serious problems:

(1) Each county lacks in-depth study and research of policies, and policy thinking is blurred. Therefore, they cannot implement policies according to specific circumstances, mechanically emphasizing that minor interests are subordinate to major interests, and ignoring that major interests must appropriately take care of minor interests under the principle that minor interests are subordinate to major interests. Originally, the policy was consistent with the demands of the masses, but contradictions occurred as a result. As a result, a perfunctory attitude was adopted towards such major issues related to the interests of the broad masses of people, and they could not be resolved well. At the same time, the special district's grasp of the situation and specific guidance were also insufficient.

(2) There is departmentalism and a purely task-oriented viewpoint. It is necessary for leaders at all levels to organize forces according to the specific circumstances of the work, distinguishing between major, minor, and priorities. However, one must never abandon management simply because there are few villages, causing some of the masses to suffer undue disasters (actually related to the interests of the broad masses in friendly districts). However, because the leaders of Xian County still have somewhat of a purely task-oriented viewpoint and departmentalism, they do not care enough about the interests of the masses. It was wrong for the leaders of Xian County to abandon the left bank of the Fuyang River and the Great Wall Dike. They should have tried to take care of the flood control work in these areas. This will inevitably separate the party and the government from the masses.

III. A Little Experience

In this work, we have a little experience with the mass perspective: The so-called complete mass perspective must proceed from the interests of the vast majority of the masses, but also appropriately take care of the interests of the minority masses, that is, the principle that minor interests are subordinate to major interests, and major interests must appropriately take care of minor interests. Any abstract talk about the interests of the majority of the masses and the unprincipled sacrifice and abandonment of the interests of the local masses is incorrect. When there is no conflict between minor interests and major interests, taking a bureaucratic and irresponsible attitude towards the interests of a local group of masses that constitute the interests of the entire masses is a manifestation of a lack of mass perspective and a lack of seriousness and responsibility towards the people. In flood control, some counties have made this mistake in handling the Zi Dike issue. Of course, the attitude of departmentalism and individualism that emphasizes taking care of the interests of local groups of people and affects the interests of the majority of the masses is even more wrong, and it is also a manifestation of a lack of serious responsibility for the greatest interests of the broad masses of people and a lack of mass perspective.

### 从处理三个防汛问题上检查干部的群众观点

　　从处理三个防汛问题上检查干部的群众观点
    这次我们到献县，河间去检查与帮助防汛工作、看到领导上在处理三个问题上采取了三种不同的态度，引起了群众三种不同的反映。这使我们对群众观点的认识，有了进一步的体会。
    一、三种不同的情况
    （一）脱离了人民群众。献县西樊屯、西大郭、庞町、南北立车、鼓刘庄等六个村，东临滏阳河，北靠长城堤。长城堤一旦决口，不但六村受灾，武强北部广大地区亦将受害。但是献县党政领导同志，对此却采取了不负责任的官僚主义态度，置之不理，并存有“淹六个村不要紧”的思想，觉得“我这边（滏阳河右岸）还顾不过来，那有力量去照顾那边”。因此对这六个村所属的堤段不管；甚至对群众自动组织起来修堤护岸所需的开支，应该予以解决的也不予以解决。六村群众看到临近武强所属堤段，县区干部亲临指导，各项防汛开支均由政府解决，就是滏阳河东岸本县地区内也有些村庄在防汛备料，比较之下，就非常不满：“县里不要咱们六个村了，咱们要求划给武强吧。”他们并正式向区干部提出，请求县长把这几个村划归武强。
    （二）群众又是埋怨又是感激。河间北司徒圈子埝，因为县区领导干部的麻痹疏忽，八月十九日在该村东面出险溃决，淹没田禾万余亩，造成了严重灾害。且使该处大堤突临洪水，坍陷漏洞种种险象不断发生，情势危急。县的领导上发现后，即令全体县区干部努力领导，专区也直接指导，加上广大群众的努力，迅速完成了全部十八里长的防汛工程，安全度过了险期，保住了广大群众的生命财产。因此，群众虽然对于子埝的溃决不满，但是对于全体县区干部努力领导护住了大堤是非常感激的，他们说：“要不是上级这样领导，大堤可保不住。”
    （三）紧密的与群众联系。献县徐召圈中七个村共地二万多亩。过去因为对子埝防护不周，连淹二年。因此群众生活困苦，埋怨政府，与政府对立。党政领导上针对此种情况，帮助献县检查了掌握子埝方针的情况，研究出有效措施。并且立刻派出干部去子埝村庄召开干部、群众会议，反复具体的讲解方针。说明小利服从大利，大利照顾小利的基本原则；说明在大堤还能保住的情况下，政府要尽力保护子埝不使溃决；如果影响到大堤的巩固与安全时，即须放弃子埝以保护大堤。又根据子牙河务局的规定，并具体地向群众说清楚：现在臧桥水位在一七·○三公尺，沙河桥在一五·八八公尺，如上游水再涨或遇狂风，大堤巩固就要受到影响，就应放弃子埝。领导干部根据这个原则与群众订立了合同，保证信守执行。同时，对子埝进行勘测，组织力量，修补险工。干部深入检查巡视。在八月二十日晚暴风雨当中，区干部冒雨去检查堤埝，指导防护；群众表示满意，都说：“像这样作咱们还有什么意见，反正咱们不能让淹五百顷、留下五十顷，怎么着也是淹少不能淹多，才是正理。”群众见到我们在行动上真正对他们热心负责，转变了两年来对政府的怀疑与对立思想，体会到政府政策的正确，表示热烈拥护，因而就密切了党与政府和人民群众的联系。
    二、领导机关存在什么问题？
    从以上三个问题来看，我们的领导机关，存在着以下两个很严重的问题：
    （一）各县对政策的深入学习与研究不够，政策思想模糊。因此，也就不能按照具体情况执行政策，机械的强调小利服从大利，忽视了在小利服从大利原则下大利必须适当照顾小利。原来政策与群众要求是一致的，结果发生了矛盾。以致对这样关系广大人民群众利益的重大问题，采取敷衍了事的态度，不能很好解决。同时专区掌握情况与具体指导也是不够。
    （二）有本位主义与单纯任务观点。各级领导上根据工作具体情况，分清主要、次要与轻重缓急来组织力量是必要的。但是绝不能因为村少不要紧就可以放弃不管，使一部分群众遭受不应有的灾害（实际关系友区广大地区群众的利益）。但因献县领导，还多少有些单纯任务观点和本位主义，对群众的利益就关心不够。献县领导干部将滏阳河左岸与长城堤放弃是不对的，应该设法照顾这些地区的防汛工作。这样，必然使党与政府脱离群众。
    三、一点体会
    在这次工作中，我们对群众观点有一点体会：所谓完整的群众观点，必须是从最大多数群众的利益出发，但又适当的照顾到少数群众的利益，即小利服从大利，大利又要适当照顾小利的原则。任何抽象地空谈大多数群众利益，而无原则地去牺牲与放弃局部群众利益都是不对的。在小利与大利没有矛盾时，对构成全体群众利益的某一局部群众利益采取官僚主义不负责任的态度，这就是缺乏群众观点与对人民不够严肃负责的表现。防汛中，有的县对子埝问题的处理，正是犯了这种错误。当然，强调照顾局部群众利益，而影响到大多数群众利益的本位主义、个人主义的态度，更是错误的，同样是缺乏对广大人民群众最大利益认真负责与缺乏群众观点的表现。
