　　Liu Lifu Group

    The production group led by Liu Lifu, a Youth League member from the Dagu Shipyard in Lushun, swore on September 2nd: to welcome "October 1st" and the World Youth Delegation to Lushun-Dalian, they would complete 350% of their production task. Now, their group has realized their oath and completed 368% of the task.
    At 12:00 noon on the 29th, the Lushun Municipal Committee of the Youth League, the Dagu Shipyard Youth League Branch, the trade union, and the factory director all came to summarize the September production achievements of the Liu Lifu Group. The reporter happened to visit them and caught up with the meeting.
    Comrade Liu Zhumao, from the blacksmith shop and also a participant in the Liu Lifu Group's production, was someone everyone wanted to hear speak. He said: "The task for all nine production groups in the blacksmith shop in September was 6,000 points. Completing 6,000 points for the entire shop would be considered 100% completion of the task. The Liu Lifu Group has seven people, so they were allocated 1,448 points. As of 12:00 noon today, they have completed a total of 5,326 points, only 674 points short. One group completed the entire blacksmith shop's September task."
    After hearing this, everyone asked in surprise, "How did they exceed it so much?" Comrade Liu Zhumao continued, "The main reason is that all members of the group exerted their strength. After they saw their August achievements and the 'October 1st' welcoming oath 'Complete 350% of the task' published in the *Democratic Youth* and newspapers on the 11th, they held a group meeting to further study how to guarantee the completion of 350%. Everyone pondered how to improve output while ensuring quality was 100%. Everyone thought that improving output should start with the ‘baked pulley’ and ‘toothed wheel.’ Because usually, these two are the slowest and most difficult to make. Everyone spoke their mind, and after a discussion, they jointly proposed two rationalization proposals. For example, in the past, the mold used for the 'baked pulley' of the crane was made of iron inside and out. It would break after forging only ten or twenty, and replacing a mold required several procedures, such as lathing and washing. If you weren't careful, the quality wouldn't be guaranteed. This time, the outside is made of iron, and the inside is made of steel. It only needs to be replaced after forging four hundred, and this one rationalization proposal alone increased output by twenty-five times. Also, when making the toothed wheel for the crane, in the past, they also used a sleeve, and this sleeve was 'flat.' When it hit the hot iron, it would sink into the hot iron, which was very troublesome to dig out. This time, they changed the sleeve to a protruding one, which did not夹铁when hitting, and would automatically fall off, so it was particularly fast to work on. Furthermore, the whole group was of one mind, and everyone believed that exceeding the task to celebrate National Day was a glorious thing, so they consciously abide by labor discipline, and no one in this month took a break."
    Liu Zhumao added: "The Liu Lifu Group mainly makes crane and dump truck parts for Dalian Metal Machinery. This group of people is eager when work comes, and they don't wait for a moment, so the truck drivers who come to pick up materials say, 'How do you all work? I can't even keep up with the material pickup!'"
    Comrade Yu Zhenfa said, "What is even more commendable here is Comrade Sun Changyou, who is in charge of firing. It usually takes two hours for others to fire such work, but he can do it in fifty minutes. The reason is that he is diligent in turning the work, so the top of the work won't be without fire, and the bottom won't be overfired. If you take out the work he fires and look closely, it is really uniform and easy to forge."
    Just as Comrade Yu Zhenfa finished speaking, the Soviet factory director Kliuchikov also came to participate in this chat. Comrade Kliuchikov patted Liu Lifu on the shoulder and said, "You are China's Stakhanov. Our Soviet Stakhanov has not yet exceeded 5,326 points. Work hard, young man, you have great prospects."
    Why do they have such high achievements? Let's listen to what Liu Lifu has to say! He said: "Our group mainly makes crane and dump truck parts. After we forge them, they are sent to Metal Machinery to be machined. After they are machined, they are sent to factories and workshops across the country for use. In industrial production, factories cannot be without cranes, and the outside cannot be without dump trucks. If we do more, more cranes and dump trucks will be produced, and factories across the country will have more and better cranes and dump trucks. Then, wouldn't our production and construction be faster? We will contribute our strength to the motherland in this way. Recently, the National Model Workers Conference was held, and many heroic models went to meet Chairman Mao with their heroic deeds. We are also here using our achievements to celebrate National Day and dedicate it to Chairman Mao."
    The Liu Lifu Group, with such enthusiasm for the motherland and Chairman Mao, displayed a high degree of enthusiasm in production, uniting, helping each other, creating, and fighting against the difficulties in production with the wisdom of the masses, and achieved excellent results.
    The motherland needs more such young people, such achievements! Let us move forward towards higher achievements! (Luda District Committee of the Youth League)

　　刘立富小组
    刘晔
    旅顺大坞青年团员刘立富领导的生产小组，于九月二日宣誓：为迎接“十、一”及世青代表团来旅大，要完成生产任务百分之三百五十。现在，他们小组实现了他们的誓言，完成了任务的百分之三百六十八。
    二十九日正午十二点钟，旅顺青年团市委，大坞团总支、工会、厂长都来给刘立富小组总结九月份的生产成绩。正好记者也跑去探望他们，赶上了这个会。
    刘竹茂同志是打铁厂的人，又是参加刘立富小组生产的，因此大家都愿意听他的发言。他说：“九月份全打铁厂九个生产小组的任务是六千点，全厂要完成六千点就算是百分之百的完成任务啦。刘立富小组是七个人，就均分了一千四百四十八点，到今天上午十二点为止，总计是完成了五千三百二十六点，差六百七十四点，他们一个组就完成了全打铁厂九月份的任务。”
    大家听完后都惊讶地问道：“怎么超过这样多呢？”刘竹茂同志又接着说：“主要是全组组员发挥了力量。他们在十一号看见《民主青年》、报纸上都登了他们八月份的成绩和迎接‘十、一’的誓言‘完成任务百分之三百五十’后，就开了一个小组会，进一步研究怎样来保证完成三百五十。大家都琢磨着，质量方面没有问题是百分之百的，就是怎样来提高产量的问题了。大家都认为提高产量要从烤比轮和牙轮来想。因为平常干的活，就数它俩干的慢，又不好干。你一言，我一语，大家一合计，这就共同提出了两条合理化建议。比方过去做吊车的‘烤比轮’用的胎，里外都是用铁做的，赶打个十个二十个的就坏了，换一个胎得用好几道手续，车、洗的，一时不注意，质量还不保准，这回外边用铁，里面用钢，打四百个才换一个，光这一个合理化建议就提高产量二十五倍。又干吊车牙轮，过去干的时候也用套子套上，这个套子是个‘扁’的，和热铁一打，就陷进热铁里去，往外挖很麻烦，这回他们把套子改成凸出的，打时不夹铁，还自动地往下掉，所以干起来就特别快了。再是，他们全组人心齐，都认为庆祝国庆日超过任务是件光荣事，因此都自觉的遵守劳动纪律，在这个月谁也没歇个工。”
    刘竹茂又补充说：“刘立富小组每月主要给大连金属机械干吊车土车子零件，这一组人，活一来眼红，一时不等，所以来拉料的汽车夫说，你们都怎么干的，我拉料都跟不上趟啦。”
    于振发同志说：“这里更值得表扬表扬的，就是烧火的孙长有同志，别人烧这样活一般得两个钟头，他用五十分钟就行了。原因就是他勤翻弄，不会把活烧的顶上没有火，底下烧过火，拿出他烧的活，仔细看看真均匀，打也好打。”
    于振发同志话刚说完，苏联厂长克流其高夫也来参加这个漫谈会了。克流其高夫同志拍拍刘立富的肩说：“你是中国的斯达哈诺夫。我们苏联的斯达哈诺夫还没有超过五千三百二十六点，好好努力吧，小伙子很有希望。”
    他们为什么有这么高的成绩呢？咱们听刘立富说说吧！他说：“我们这一组主要是干吊车和土车零件，由我们打好了，送到金属机械去车，它再车好了，就送到各地工厂车间里去用，在工业生产上，厂里不能离开吊车，外边少不了土车子，如果我们多干，吊车和土车就生产得更多，各地工厂都有更多更好的吊车土车用，那么我们的生产建设不是更快了么，我们就要这样去为祖国贡献我们的力量。最近，全国英模大会召开了，多少英雄模范们带着他们的英雄事迹去见毛主席，我们也在这里用我们的成绩来庆祝国庆日，献给毛主席。”
    刘立富小组就这样怀着对祖国，对毛主席的热爱在生产中发挥了高度的热情，团结着，互助着，创造着，用群众的智慧和生产中的困难斗争着，获得了优秀的成绩。
    祖国需要更多这样的青年，这样的成绩！让我们不停地向着更高的成绩前进！（旅大区团委）
