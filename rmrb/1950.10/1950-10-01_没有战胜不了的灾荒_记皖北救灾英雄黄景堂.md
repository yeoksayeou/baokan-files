　　No Disaster is Unbeatable - Remembering Anhui's Disaster Relief Hero, Huang Jingtang
　　Han Zi
　　In the eyes of the comrades of the CPC Suxian County Committee, Comrade Huang Jingtang is a veteran comrade who can endure hardship and delve into the masses. Last June, the disaster situation in northern Anhui was quite serious. The County Committee decided to send Comrade Huang Jingtang to work in the countryside. He first participated in the fierce struggle against bandits and local tyrants in Wangdian District. By September, the disaster was even more severe. He went to Gangjia Village, Zhangmiao Township, a newly liberated area, to help with the work. In the evening, as he approached the village, he saw the ground around him shining, knowing that the entire village was in waterlogged areas. He was anxious, thinking about how to provide disaster relief. Suddenly, he heard a sound in the water. He listened carefully and guessed that it was fish moving in the water, which resolved his worry. He thought that as soon as he arrived in the village, he would mobilize people to bail water and catch fish.

　　When he arrived at the village, he found out that more than forty of the one hundred and ten households had nothing to eat. At the village meeting, everyone suggested fleeing the famine as soon as possible. Comrade Huang Jingtang persuaded them, saying, "Fleeing the famine is not the answer; production for self-relief is the only way." Everyone asked him how to achieve self-relief. He pointed to the pond in front of the village and suggested bailing water to catch fish. Everyone laughed at him, saying, "There have never been fish here; it's a blind search." Huang Jingtang told them about the sound in the water and finally persuaded forty-three people. He himself took the lead, barefoot in the water, and everyone followed suit. Later, even more people joined in. After bailing for five days and five nights, a pond of eight acres revealed mud. In the small puddles, fresh fish were jumping, and they could be caught by hand. A total of 1,600 catties of fish were caught, which were exchanged for two stones and two and a half sheng of sorghum and thirty-one catties of cotton. This became the capital for self-relief through production. Everyone trusted Old Huang and said to him with a smile, "The Communist Party can come up with any prescription. There have never been fish in this pond before; how come there are fish as soon as you come?" Old Huang said, "Nothing is impossible for a willing mind. If we all work together, even things that could not be done in the past can be done." Under his leadership, twenty-one women were organized to spin thread, and four groups were organized to carry salt. The entire Zhangmiao Township looked like Gangjia Village, and they all organized sideline production to overcome the famine and achieve self-relief, barely surviving the winter famine.

　　Wangji Township was a severely affected area in Wangdian District. By the tenth month of the lunar calendar, people were almost starving to death. The District Committee sent Comrade Huang Jingtang to serve as the township instructor (i.e., secretary of the CPC branch). He and the township head divided the work and focused on production and disaster relief. By November, two hundred and fourteen households in the township had run out of food, and almost the entire township was in a low-lying area. He first mobilized people in Wangji Village to bail water for fish. At that time, the weather was cold, and everyone felt cold looking at the water. He was the first to go barefoot into the water again, and Township Head Ma also followed him into the water. This time, they organized seventy-three people to go into the water, and after bailing water for five days and six nights, they caught seven hundred catties of fish. Heaven was against them, and heavy rain filled the big pond again. He then busied himself organizing ninety production teams with seven hundred and thirty laborers throughout the township to push salt, grind tofu, chop firewood, dig lotus roots, and spin thread. They relied on the mountains for food, the water for food, and labor for food, earning thirty thousand catties of grain. The government also released some relief grain, and the more than five thousand people in the township finally survived the twelfth month.

　　After several days of heavy rain, the river water rose, and Wangji Township was flooded with more than a foot of water, and the wheat fields were submerged. The masses reported to the township government and cried to Old Huang:

　　"Old Huang, you've wasted your efforts. The water has risen more than a foot deep. What will we harvest next year? Quickly lead us to flee the famine!"

　　Old Huang's face changed when he heard this. He hurried to check the water. He took off his shoes and ran more than twenty miles around the township, not afraid of freezing his feet. He only cared about the crops and forgot about the pain in his feet. After looking around and studying the terrain, he decided that the only way to survive was to dig ditches to drain the water. He came back and discussed it with the masses, and the masses clamored:

　　"Good Old Huang, don't mention digging ditches to drain the water. The Chen family in Hunan (village name, the feudal stronghold of Wangji Township) won't let us move a piece of soil, fearing that it will ruin their feng shui. Every year when the water rises, we want to dig ditches to drain the water, but they don't allow it. This matter has been in litigation from the guerrilla area to the liberated area for more than ten years, and they haven't allowed it once. If we could have drained it, we would have done it long ago."

　　Old Huang thought that saving lives was the most important thing, and there was no brain that couldn't be opened. He assured the masses that as long as everyone prepared to dig ditches to drain the water, he would go to Hunan Chen's family to persuade them. Starting on the second day of the new year, Old Huang ran to Chen Village every day in the name of investigating the disaster. The road was deep and icy, and he had to step down from the ice with a "squeak," and then pull his leg out of the ice hole like a knife edge. He ran seventeen trips in five days, tearing two pairs of cotton pants and a pair of single pants. In the end, even the skin on his calf was torn, which was scary with blood. He didn't feel it himself, but the older people in Chen Village were moved. The middle and poor peasants no longer insisted on the tradition of ruining feng shui. They all said, "Why is he doing this after all? His lips are parched, and he runs back and forth like this. Who can look at it without being convinced?" As soon as they agreed to open the ditch, more than a thousand people in the township fought against the cold water and cold wind in the fields. The ditch was dug, and the floodwater rolled away along the ditch, saving forty-one hectares of wheat and more than seventy hectares of barren land. The masses wanted to call this ditch "Huang Jingtang Ditch" and raise money to erect a monument for him, but he refused, saying, "This ditch was dug by everyone. How can it be named after me alone? Shouldn't the money for erecting a monument be used to buy a few more sheng of grain to eat?"

　　This year in March, it rained continuously. Old Huang went out to investigate the disaster, starting at the cock's crow, arriving at people's homes at mealtime, checking every village and household, and counting more than seven hundred households without food or short of food. Old Huang, on the one hand, helped them continue to carry out sideline production, and on the other hand, opened a rich peasant meeting, mobilizing seven hundred catties of mutual aid grain, plus one thousand catties of relief grain issued by the government last time, preparing to distribute it to the severely affected households for emergency relief. In theory, each household would not get much even if a few grains were distributed. He was afraid that everyone would finish eating it all at once, so he organized thirty-seven small mills, ten households in a group. The leader of the group was responsible for leading the grinding at home, and the deputy leader received the grain every day, four taels per person per day, which could make a bowl of thin soup and would not starve to death. At this time, the higher authorities issued another six hundred catties of relief grain, enough for them to hold on for a while. At the village head and village tail, they touched six sections of railway tracks that were torn down during the reactionary rule, and exchanged them for three hundred catties of grain, maintaining them for more than two months in total. He smashed his hand when moving the railway tracks. His left middle finger and index finger were flattened. The higher authorities gave him fifteen catties of millet to buy medicine and recuperate. He endured the pain and only applied some tooth powder and toothpaste to his hand, saving the grain for the three poorest families. By the end of March, those who were weak and drank thin soup of wild vegetables and flour got sick. Their heads were as big as bamboo baskets, and their eyes were so swollen that they could not see anything, which made people feel uncomfortable. Old Huang took two doctors to look at each household. The doctor told them to only give them noodles and not to eat wild vegetables anymore. This made Old Huang very distressed. He couldn't sleep at night, got up and discussed it with Township Head Ma and Assistant Zhao. He suggested changing their three shares of two catties and four taels of flour per day to five taels per person mixed with wild vegetables and thin soup. In the next few days, he was seen carrying a bamboo basket and running to the homes of the sick, giving a little to the patient. One hundred and seventy people improved their complexion and did not die. Old Huang and the others were so hungry that they had stomachaches all day long and had no strength. They couldn't support their waists when they squatted down. They dragged on like this until the wheat harvest. When the masses saw that the township government was drinking thin soup, they were all moved and said, "The People's Government is really thinking of us in every way, just like us." Someone asked Old Huang how he could drink thin soup. He sincerely answered everyone with tears in his eyes: "I was not born to eat my fill. I begged for food from the age of four to twenty-one. I have eaten all kinds of food, and I know the taste of being hungry."

　　When it was time to plant sorghum, but those who were drinking thin soup had no strength to go to the ground. Old Huang took the lead in pulling the plow and harrowing the land. He didn't show any signs of being hungry, desperately holding on. The masses also followed him with all their might. If he didn't rest, everyone else didn't rest. In this way, ninety hectares of miscellaneous grains were planted. After planting, hateful wireworms grew everywhere, eating the newly grown sorghum sparsely. This was more uncomfortable than gnawing at Old Huang's heart. After thinking about it, he tried a method, digging a small ditch in the field, laying miscellaneous grass on it. In the morning, he saw that the wireworms had come to eat the miscellaneous grass and rolled into the ditch. He could catch several bamboo baskets in the morning, and he used this method to save more than twenty hectares of miscellaneous grains. When it came time for the wheat harvest, unfortunately, a bad wind was blowing, and the wheat looked withered. The good wheat only yielded 20%. After the wheat harvest, it was dry again, and the autumn grain could not be planted. The masses ran to Old Huang with tears in their eyes and said:

　　"Old Huang, you have worked so hard to help us live through a winter and a spring. We see your affection, but looking at the way things are now, we really can't live without fleeing the famine."

　　Old Huang again persuaded everyone, saying, "Don't take this road again. The more you flee, the more desolate it becomes. Our country is still in difficulty now. Even if you flee, you can't guarantee that you won't go hungry. Besides, it will delay production at home, and it will be even more difficult in the future." He suggested that everyone dig wells and draw water to plant white taro. At that time, his words had the prestige of an "imperial edict," and everyone obeyed. He himself was busy taking the lead again, working day and night for nine days, only sleeping dimly during the day. Together, they dug forty wells, and the water overflowed. More than two thousand adults and children in the township carried water buckets, carrying large jars and small jars to the ground, like an army fighting a battle, in waves, racing to plant twenty hectares of white taro.

　　Before long, it was time for the flood again. One evening, he saw that the north river had opened along the bank, and the flood was rushing over, about to reach the edge of their township. He and the township head shouted everywhere, calling the masses to quickly take shovels and spades to build dikes to prevent flooding. At that time, more than 1,700 people came out, working continuously for a day and two nights, building a more than one-foot-high and sixteen-mile-long earthen dike, finally stopping the water and enclosing the entire township's land in a safe zone. Then, he called on the people to sow seeds. The masses replied to him, "We will not leave an inch of land idle. If we don't sow seeds like this, we will be letting down the Communist Party." But their township lacked livestock. Old Huang promised to find a way for them in other townships. When it was time for the market, people from various townships came to the market. Old Huang held a mass meeting, borrowing cattle from the masses of other townships, explaining the significance of mutual assistance and telling them the reward method that had been discussed with the masses of this township, promising to plant one or two mu of grain for each cattle owner. In a few days, two hundred and twenty cattle came, and Wangji Township was like a cattle market, very lively! Together, they planted fifty-three hectares of white taro, twenty-eight hectares of carrots, forty hectares of mung beans, and forty hectares of buckwheat. Land that had never been planted in the past was planted. At this time, a group of bandits wanted to come and steal cattle. The masses were worried and uneasy. Old Huang again assured them, "You can rest assured and plant well. I will not leave Wangji Township even if I die. There are militiamen guarding you!" He took fourteen militiamen, patrolling around the township at night, sleeping in old tombs and on the ridges of fields, living outside for a month and seven days.

　　The water could not enter the township, and the bandits could not get to the village. This solid earthen dike built under the leadership of Old Huang and the steel-like team of militiamen protected this year's autumn harvest.

　　没有战胜不了的灾荒  记皖北救灾英雄黄景堂
    菡子
    黄景堂同志，在中共宿县县委的同志们看来，他是一个能够吃苦耐劳深入群众的老同志，去年六月，皖北的灾情相当严重，县委决定黄景堂同志下乡工作，他先在王店区里参加了激烈的反匪反霸的斗争。到九月，灾情更严重了，他到新解放区张庙乡刚家村去帮助工作，傍晚他走近庄子，只见四围地上闪着光亮，知道这庄尽是在水窝里了，他心里着急，打算怎样救灾，忽听水里有响声，侧耳静听，才猜出这是水中鱼动，这解了他的结，他想一到庄上，就动员戽水摸鱼。
    到了庄上，他弄清楚一百十多户中已有四十多户没有吃的，在村民会上大家提议赶早逃荒，黄景堂同志劝住他们说：“逃荒不是路，生产自救才是办法。”大家请教他怎么自救，他指着庄前的水汪，提出戽水摸鱼，大家笑他傻，说：“古来就没鱼，摸是瞎摸。”黄景堂把水里响动的情况告诉他们，好歹说服了四十三人。他自己先赤脚下水，大家也跟着下了水，后来参加的人就更多了。戽了五天五夜，八亩地大的一块汪子，露出了泥，小水窝里鲜鱼拍达拍达的跳着，伸手就能逮着，共摸出一千六百斤鱼，换了两石两升五的秫秫，三十一斤棉花，这就成了生产自救的资本。大家对老黄信服起来，笑着对他说：“共产党什么方子都能开得出来，这水汪古来没鱼，怎么你来了就有鱼了呢。”老黄说：“天下无难事，只怕有心人，咱大家伙肯齐心，古来做不到的事都能做到。”在他的领导下，又组织了二十一个妇女纺线，四个挑盐组，整个张庙乡有了刚家村的样子，都组织了副业生产渡荒自救，全乡勉强度过冬荒。
    王集乡是王店区的重灾区，到旧历十月，几乎有饿死人的现象，区委就派黄景堂同志去担任乡指导员（即中共支部书记）的工作，他与乡长分工专搞生产救灾。这乡到十一月已有二一四户断炊，全乡几乎都在洼地里。他首先在王集村动员戽鱼，那时，天气正冷着，谁看着水都心凉，又是他第一个赤脚下去了，马乡长也跟着下了水。这次他们组织了七十三人下水，五天六夜戽完水捉了七百斤鱼。老天跟他们作对，哗哗大雨，把大汪又下满了。他又忙着在全乡组织了九十个生产小组，七百三十个劳动力，推盐、磨豆腐、打劈柴、挖藕、纺线，靠山吃山，靠水吃水，靠力气换饭，赚了三万斤粮食，政府又放了一部分救济粮，全乡五千多口总算熬过了腊月。
    几天大雨，河水上涨，王集乡平地起水一尺多深，麦田都淹了水，群众来报告乡政府，对着老黄哭叽叽的说：
    “老黄，你算白费心机了，水涨一尺多深，明年还收什么？赶快领着俺逃荒吧！”
    老黄一听脸色都变了，他赶快去看水，腊月天不怕冻脚脱了鞋子满乡跑了二十多里，心里只顾替庄稼难受，脚痛也忘记了。他看来看去研究了地形，决定只有挖沟放水一条活路，回来和群众商量，群众哗哗的说：
    “好老黄呵，你别提挖沟放水吧，人家湖南陈家（庄名，是王集乡的封建堡垒）不让动一块土，怕的坏了他们的风水，年年涨水咱想挖沟放水就是他们不依，这事从游击区到解放区，十几年就打这个官司，没让放一回，要能放早就放了。”
    老黄心想救命要紧，没有打不开的脑筋，他向群众保证说：只要大家准备挖沟放水，湖南陈家归我去说服。起年初二老黄以查灾为名，天天跑陈庄。这一路水深冰冻，从冰上咕吱踏下去，再提上来就得从刀口一样的冰窟窿里抽出腿来，五天跑了十七趟，拉毁了一条棉裤一条单裤，最后连小腿上的皮肉也拉毁了，血淋淋的怕人。他自己不觉得，陈庄有年纪的人看得动了心，中贫农也不坚持败坏风水的传统了。都说：“人家到底为什么呢？嘴唇皮子说枯了，一趟趟跑得这个样子，谁看着不服。”这边一答应开沟，全乡一千多人就在田野里跟寒水冷风战斗起来，沟挖成了，害水顺着沟路滚走了，救出麦子四十一顷，白地七十多顷。群众要把这条沟叫做“黄景堂沟”，又要凑钱给他竖碑，他都不依，他说：“这沟是大家开的，怎么能叫我一个人的名字，有竖碑的钱不能多买几升粮食喝喝么？”
    今年三月，天连着下雨，老黄出去查灾，鸡叫动身，赶吃饭时到人家家里，挨庄挨户查看，统计没有吃或缺粮的有七百多户。老黄一面帮助他们继续进行副业生产，一面开富农会，动员了互济粮七百斤，再加政府上次发放的救济粮一千斤，准备分给严重的灾户救急。照说每户数粒子分都摊不到多少，他怕一次分了大家吃完算数，就组织了小磨三十七盘，十家一组，正组长在家负责领导拐磨，副组长每天到时领粮，每人每天四两，能喝一顿稀汤，也就饿不死了。这时上级又发了六百斤救济粮，够他们撑一撑，在庄头庄尾，摸了六根反动派统治时代扒来的路轨，又换了三百斤粮，总共维持了两个多月。他在搬路轨时砸了手，左手中指食指扁了一截，上级给了他十五斤小米买药调理，他忍着痛只在手上按些牙粉牙膏了事，省下粮食给了三家最穷的。到三月底，身体弱喝野菜拌面粉稀汤的都得了病，头肿笆斗大，眼睛也肿得看不见什么，叫人看着难受。老黄带着两个医生挨户瞧看，医生关照要净给他们面吃，可不能再吃野菜。这可把老黄难死了，晚上睡不着觉，爬起和马乡长和赵助理员商量，他提议把他们三份每天二斤四两面粉改成一人照五两掺野菜喝稀汤。以后几天就看见他背着笆斗，朝有病的人家跑，见病人给一点，有一百七十人转了气色，没有死掉。老黄他们自己可饿得成天闹肚子痛，浑身没劲，一蹲下去就支不起腰，这样一直拖到麦收。群众见乡政府都喝稀汤，都感动的说：“人民政府真是处处条条为我们，跟我们是一个样子。”有人问老黄怎么喝得来稀汤，他眼里含着泪花诚恳的回答大家：“我不是那吃饱饭的人出身，起四岁要饭到二十一岁，什么饭没有吃过，我知道饿肚子的味道。”
    到可以种秫秫了，可是喝稀汤的都没劲下地，老黄首先领着拉犁耙地，他没显出一点饿肚的样子，拚命撑着，群众也一个劲的跟着他，他不歇大家也不歇，这样种下了九十顷杂粮。种下以后，可恨遍地长了土蚕，把刚长出的秫秫吃得稀稀拉拉的，这比啃老黄的心窝还难受，想来想去他试用了一个办法，在田里挖了一条小沟，铺上杂草，早上一看，土蚕来吃杂草都滚在沟里了，一早能逮几笆斗，就用这个办法救出了二十多顷杂粮。到麦收时，不巧正刮坏风，麦子看着秕下去，好好的麦子只收二成。麦收以后，天又旱，秋粮没法下种，群众都眼泪花花跑来对老黄说：
    “老黄你千辛万苦，帮我们活过一冬一春，我们见你的情，看现在这个样子，再不逃荒实在没法活了。”
    老黄又劝住大家说：“快别走这条路吧，愈逃愈荒，现在我们国家还困难，逃出去也保不住不饿肚子，再说家里又耽误生产，往后去就更苦了。”他提议大家挖井，开出水来栽白芋，那时他的话有了威信跟“圣旨”一样，大家都依了。他自己又忙着带头，九天不分昼夜，只白天眯眯蒙蒙睡一觉。一起打了四十口井，水泛泛的满出来了，全乡有两千多大人娃子都担着水桶，提着大罐小罐上了地，好比打仗的队伍一样，一阵一阵的，抢着种下了二十顷白芋。
    没有多久又到涨水的时候，一天傍晚，他看着北河开了沿，水头呼呼的冲过来，眼看就到他们乡的边上。他跟乡长一起到处吆呼着，叫群众快拿锨的拿锨拿锹的拿锹，出来筑堤防水。当时出来一千七百多人，连着做了一天两夜，筑有一尺多高十六里路长的土堤，终于挡住了水，把整个乡的土地围在安全地带。接着号召播种，群众回答他说：“包不叫闲一块地，像这样不下种，再也对不起共产党。”可是他们乡缺的是牲口，老黄答应替他们到别乡设法。在逢集的时候，各乡人都有来赶集的，老黄召开了群众大会，跟别乡的群众借牛，一面说明互助的意义，一面把与本乡群众商议好的报酬办法告诉他们，答应替每条牛主种一两亩粮食。没几天来了二百二十条牛，王集乡就像是贩牛场似的，可热闹！一齐种下白芋五十三顷、胡萝卜二十八顷、绿豆四十顷、荞麦四十顷，古来没种的地都种上了。这时有一帮土匪想来抢牛，群众愁得不安，老黄又对他们保证说：“你们放心下种好了，我打死不离王集乡，有民兵护着你们呢！”他带了十四个民兵，夜里围着乡巡逻，在老坟、田埂上睡觉，在外面住了一个月零七天。
    水进不了乡，土匪上不了庄子，这由老黄领导着筑成的坚固的土堤和民兵们钢铁的队伍，保卫了今年秋天的丰收。
