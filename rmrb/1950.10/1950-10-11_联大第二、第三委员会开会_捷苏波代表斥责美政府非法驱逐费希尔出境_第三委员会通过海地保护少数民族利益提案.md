(Xinhua News Agency, October 10th) A compilation of TASS reports:

　　The Second (Economic and Financial) and Third (Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural) Committees of the United Nations General Assembly have both begun their work.

    At the Second Committee meeting on October 5th, representatives from Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and Poland spoke successively, denouncing the U.S. government for violating its agreement with the United Nations by deporting Fischer, a representative of the World Federation of Trade Unions who had legally come to New York and was preparing to attend the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. They also denounced the refusal to issue entry visas to two other representatives of the WFTU, and demanded that the UN Secretary-General take necessary steps in this regard. The Chairman of the Committee, Cuban representative Gutiérrez, agreed to notify the UN Secretary-General of this situation.

    At the Third Committee meeting on October 6th, the report of the Economic and Social Council was discussed. The Haitian representative proposed that the General Assembly should notify the Economic and Social Council to rescind its decision not to convene the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in 1951. The Haitian proposal was opposed by representatives from the United Kingdom, Australia, and others. The Soviet representative, Panyushin, expressed support for the Haitian proposal, and pointed out that this unreasonable decision by the Economic and Social Council demonstrates the tendency of the Economic and Social Council, under the manipulation of the American and British majority, to evade important economic and social issues, and only devote itself to solving secondary technical problems. The Haitian proposal was ultimately passed by the committee.

　　联大第二、第三委员会开会
    捷苏波代表斥责美政府非法驱逐费希尔出境  第三委员会通过海地保护少数民族利益提案
    【新华社十日讯】综合塔斯社讯：联合国大会第二（经济及财政）委员会及第三（社会、人道与文化）委员会均已开始工作。
    第二委员会十月五日会议上，捷克斯洛伐克、苏联、波兰代表相继发言，斥责美国政府违反其与联合国间的协定，将依法前来纽约、准备列席联合国第五届大会的世界工会联合会代表费希尔驱逐出境，并拒绝发给世界工联另外二位代表的入境签证，而要求联合国秘书长对此采取必要步骤。委员会主席古巴代表古蒂艾雷兹答应将这种情况通知联合国秘书长。
    第三委员会十月六日会议讨论经社理事会报告。海地代表提议联大应通知经社理事会，使其撤消关于在一九五一年内不召开防止歧视及保护少数民族小组委员会的决定。海地提案为英国、澳大利亚等代表所反对。苏联代表潘友新表示支持海地提案，并指出经社理事会的此种不合理的决定，正表现经社理事会在美英多数操纵下规避经济及社会方面的重要问题，而仅致力于解决次要技术问题的倾向。海地提案最后为委员会所通过。
