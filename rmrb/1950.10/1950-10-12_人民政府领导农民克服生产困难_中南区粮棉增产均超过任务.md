　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 10th -- This year's grain and cotton harvest in the Central South Region is good. According to estimates from the Agriculture and Forestry Department of the Central South Military and Administrative Committee: this year, the total output of raw grain in the entire region may reach more than 69.6 billion catties (excluding late autumn crops), and the harvest of ginned cotton may exceed 260 million catties, exceeding the grain and cotton production increase targets set by the Central People's Government for the entire Central South Region.

　　This spring, the Central People's Government issued instructions on agricultural production guidelines and grain and cotton production increase plans, stipulating that in the newly liberated areas of the Central South Region, production should be maintained at last year's level and not decline, while in Henan Province and other provinces with a better work foundation, grain production should be increased by a total of 1.65 billion catties over last year's production level, and the entire region should produce more than 246 million catties of ginned cotton. After the instructions were issued, governments at all levels in the Central South Region led farmers to overcome various production difficulties and resolutely worked to complete the above-mentioned production tasks. In the spring, social order in the Central South Region had not yet been completely stabilized, and 13 million people lived in areas affected by famine. Many farmers lacked living and production materials, and farmers in the newly liberated areas still had concerns about developing production. Governments at all levels in the Central South Region, in response to the above situation, first cooperated with military suppression of bandits to launch a movement among farmers against local tyrants, resolutely suppressed counter-revolutionary saboteurs, and ensured the stability of social order and production order throughout the region. Secondly, in order to meet the demands of the broad masses of farmers for rent reduction, the people's governments in various places in the Central South Region led farmers to reduce rent, enabling farmers throughout the region to reduce rent by more than 1 billion catties of grain. The Central People's Government allocated a total of 140 million catties of grain for agricultural investment and agricultural loans to support farmers in the Central South Region in carrying out production, and the people's governments of the Central South provinces also issued a total of more than 500 million catties of loan grain, which initially solved the difficulties of the masses of farmers in life and production.

　　Before and after the start of spring plowing, people's governments at all levels in the Central South Region universally convened people's representative conferences and district and township farmer representative conferences, widely publicizing the "whoever plants, harvests, and bears the burden" and "protect labor income" and other ten policies related to spring plowing production promulgated by the Central South Military and Administrative Committee, eliminating the concerns of some farmers about developing production. After the above series of measures, this year's spring plowing and sowing were completed in a timely and smooth manner, and the sown area was even greater than in previous years. At the same time, in order to ensure increased grain and cotton production, the people's governments in various places in the Central South Region led farmers to overcome various disasters such as floods, droughts, and insects. As of the end of June, a total of more than 130 million cubic meters of earthwork had been completed for large-scale water conservancy projects throughout the region, effectively reducing the degree of flood damage, benefiting more than 24 million mu of farmland. Secondly, nearly 20,000 anti-drought canals were completed and nearly 90,000 ponds and dams were repaired throughout the region, benefiting 4.6 million mu of farmland, so that the droughts that occurred in parts of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces this summer did not lead to serious disasters. In addition, the people's governments in various places in the Central South Region led farmers to vigorously prevent and control insect pests. For example, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government led farmers to carry out spring rice borer control work, so that 90% of the province's early rice fields did not experience rice borer damage.

　　After the above-mentioned various efforts, the Central South Region harvested a total of more than 14.6 billion catties of various grains in the summer harvest; the average autumn crop was 80% successful, and the entire region is expected to harvest more than 55 billion catties of autumn grain. The summer and autumn crops together harvested more than 69.6 billion catties of raw grain, an increase of more than 8 billion catties over last year. The region's cotton production is also estimated to exceed the target set by the Central People's Government by more than 10 million catties.

　　人民政府领导农民克服生产困难
    中南区粮棉增产均超过任务
    【新华社汉口十日电】中南区各地今年粮棉收成良好。据中南军政委员会农林部估计：今年全区原粮总产量可达六百九十六亿余斤（不包括晚秋），皮棉可收二亿六千万斤以上，可超过中央人民政府所规定的全中南区的粮棉增产任务。
    今春，中央人民政府曾发布农业生产方针和粮棉增产计划的指示，规定中南区今年在新解放地区保持去年生产水平不使下降，在河南省和其他各省工作基础较好的地区，则要求在去年的生产水平上共增产粮食十六亿五千万斤，同时全区并应生产皮棉二亿四千六百余万斤。指示下达后，中南各级人民政府即领导农民克服种种生产上的困难，坚决地为完成上述的生产任务而努力。在春季时，中南区社会秩序尚未完全安定，又有一千三百万人口的地区存有灾荒，不少农民缺乏生活资料和生产资料，新解放地区的农民对发展生产还存有顾虑。中南各级人民政府即针对上述情况，首先配合军事剿匪发动农民进行反对恶霸运动，坚决镇压反革命破坏分子，确保全区社会秩序和生产秩序的安定。其次，为了适应广大农民减租的要求，中南各地人民政府又领导农民进行减租，使全区农民共减回租粮十亿余斤。中央人民政府为扶助中南农民进行生产，共拨发农业投资粮、农贷粮一亿四千万斤，中南各省人民政府也共发放贷粮五亿斤以上，初步地解决了农民群众生活上和生产上的困难。
    在春耕开始前后，中南各地人民政府普遍召开了各界人民代表会议和区、乡农民代表会议，广泛地宣传中南军政委员会所颁布的“谁种谁收谁负担”、“保护劳动所得”等有关春耕生产的十项政策，消除了某些农民对发展生产的顾虑。经过了上述一系列的措施，今年的春耕播种得以及时顺利完成，播种面积且比往年增多。同时，为了保证粮棉增产，中南各地人民政府又领导农民战胜了水、旱、虫等各种灾害。全区的大规模水利岁修工程，截至六月底止共完成防洪工程土方一亿三千余万公方，有效地减轻了水害的程度，受益农田在二千四百万亩以上。其次全区又完成防旱水渠近两万条，整修塘坝近九万座，受益农田达四百六十万亩，使今夏豫、鄂、湘、赣部分地区所发生的旱象，都未酿成严重灾害。此外，中南各地人民政府又领导农民大力防治虫害，如江西省人民政府领导农民进行春季治螟工作，使该省百分之九十的早稻田未发生螟害。
    经过上述的种种努力，中南全区在夏收中，共计收获各种粮食一百四十六亿余斤；秋季作物平均有八成年景，全区约可收获秋粮五百五十亿余斤。夏、秋两季作物共收获原粮六百九十六亿余斤，较去年增产八十余亿斤。全区棉花的产量估计也可较中央人民政府所规定的任务超过一千余万斤。
