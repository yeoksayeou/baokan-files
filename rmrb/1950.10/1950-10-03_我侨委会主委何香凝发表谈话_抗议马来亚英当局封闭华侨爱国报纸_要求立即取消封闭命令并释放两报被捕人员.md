Xinhua News Agency, 30th—He Xiangning, Chairperson of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, issued a statement regarding the British colonial government in Malaya's arbitrary closure of the Singapore "Nanyang Siang Pau" and the Penang "Modern Daily" on the 21st of this month, and the illegal detention of the persons in charge of the two newspapers, as follows:

On the one hand, Britain has expressed its willingness to establish diplomatic relations with the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, but on the other hand, it is even more brutally persecuting our overseas Chinese in Malaya, such as large-scale arrests of our good overseas Chinese, unreasonable expulsion of our overseas Chinese, destruction of overseas Chinese schools, and even wanton burning of villages where our overseas Chinese live. Its brutality is worse than the actions of the Japanese fascist warlords in Malaya during the war.

The reason given by the British colonial government in Malaya for closing the "Nanyang Siang Pau" and the "Modern Daily" this time is that the two newspapers support the Central People's Government, support world democracy and peace, and oppose American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and its attack on the Korean people. This reason is completely untenable. Since Britain has announced its willingness to establish diplomatic relations with our Central People's Government, the British government and its Malayan colonial government should respect the right of our overseas Chinese to express their support for the People's Republic of China and the national policies promulgated by the Central People's Government—supporting world democracy and peace; and the right to oppose American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Korea. However, the British colonial government in Malaya, on the one hand, condones the reactionary newspapers of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang—such as the Singapore "Chung Shing Daily News"—to carry out all kinds of shameless slanders against our Central People's Government; on the other hand, after carrying out despicable and idiotic sabotage and destruction against the "Nanyang Siang Pau" and the "Modern Daily," which support our Central People's Government, it has further arbitrarily and unreasonably closed them down. The retrograde actions of the British colonial government in Malaya are an extremely unfriendly manifestation towards the Chinese people.

I solemnly warn the British government: The Chinese people cannot tolerate the various crimes committed by the British colonial authorities in Malaya in persecuting overseas Chinese, and the British government should bear full responsibility for all the crimes committed by the British colonial authorities in Malaya against overseas Chinese. The British colonial government in Malaya should immediately cancel the closure order against the "Nanyang Siang Pau" and the "Modern Daily" and unconditionally release all personnel of the two newspapers who have been illegally arrested. At the same time, I call on overseas Chinese in Malaya to unite and continue to fight for their legitimate rights and interests.

　　我侨委会主委何香凝发表谈话
    抗议马来亚英当局封闭华侨爱国报纸
    要求立即取消封闭命令并释放两报被捕人员
    【新华社三十日讯】马来亚英国殖民政府于本月二十一日蛮横地封闭新加坡《南侨日报》和槟榔屿《现代日报》，并非法拘捕该两报负责人。中央人民政府华侨事务委员会主任委员何香凝对此发表谈话如下：
    英国一方面表示愿和我中华人民共和国中央人民政府建立外交关系，另一方面却更加残暴地迫害我马来亚侨胞，诸如大规模逮捕我善良侨胞，无理驱逐我侨胞出境，摧残华侨学校，甚至肆意焚毁我侨胞聚居的村庄。其残暴较日本法西斯军阀战时在马来亚的行动，有过之而无不及。
    马来亚英国殖民政府这次封闭《南侨日报》和《现代日报》的理由，是该两报拥护中央人民政府，拥护世界民主和平，反对美帝国主义侵略台湾和进攻朝鲜人民。这个理由是完全不能成立的。英国既已宣布愿与我中央人民政府建立外交关系，英国政府及其马来亚殖民政府应即尊重我国侨胞表示拥护中华人民共和国，和中央人民政府所颁布的国策——拥护世界民主和平的权利；反对美帝国主义侵略台湾和朝鲜的权利。但是，马来亚英殖民政府反而一方面纵容蒋介石匪帮的反动报纸——如新加坡《中兴日报》等，对我中央人民政府进行种种无耻的诬蔑；另一方面，对于拥护我中央人民政府的《南侨日报》和《现代日报》，于进行卑劣愚妄的破坏和摧残之后，更进一步加以横暴无理的封闭。马来亚英国殖民政府这样倒行逆施，是对中国人民极不友好的表现。
    我正告英国政府：马来亚英国殖民当局迫害华侨的种种罪行，是中国人民所不能容忍的，马来亚英国殖民当局对待华侨的一切罪行，英国政府都应该负全部责任。马来亚英国殖民政府应该立即取消对《南侨日报》和《现代日报》的封闭命令，并无条件地释放该两报一切被非法逮捕的人员。同时我号召马来亚华侨团结一致，继续为争取他们的正当权益而奋斗。
