    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社消息：奥地利各阶层人民代表六百余人，于十月二十一日在维也纳举行了拥护和平会议，选举出席第二届世界拥护和平大会的代表。
    会议听取了维也纳和平委员会主席、工程师史丁格的报告，他说，仅在奥地利首都维也纳一地，就已为斯德哥尔摩和平宣言征集了三十七万五千个签名。签名运动是在奥地利反动派肆无忌惮的威胁之下进行的，但是据奥地利和平委员会宣布，全奥已有八十二万九千六百九十五人在和平宣言上签了名。
    大会选出了十一名参加第二届世界拥护和平大会的代表，其中有工人、教师、医生、共产党议员费希尔等人。
    为了庆祝这次会议，维也纳劳动青年在当天晚上举行了火炬游行。成千成万个男女青年拿着火炬和旗帜走过市中心区，到达市政厅广场，约有二万维也纳劳动人民在那里举行了盛大的集会。
