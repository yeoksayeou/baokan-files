[Report from this newspaper] The working class throughout Northeast China firmly supports the statements of Foreign Minister Zhou and the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, unanimously opposes U.S. imperialism's expansion of the Korean War of aggression, which threatens our national security, and protests against the repeated violations of our airspace by U.S. imperialist aircraft. Workers in factories across the region are using practical actions to increase production, expressing their determination to defend the motherland and oppose aggression. At the same time, workers are further heightening their vigilance and preparing to strike a blow against the U.S. imperialist aggressors.

The Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions, representing more than 218,000 workers, issued a statement saying: "The Chinese people, after more than 20 years of arduous struggle, have finally established their own country. Today, we certainly have full determination, confidence, and strength to defend our country. If U.S. imperialism dares to risk invading our sacred motherland, we will resolutely and thoroughly annihilate it! The entire working class of Shenyang City should immediately unite, mobilize, and work harder in production to resolutely smash the U.S. imperialist's heinous acts of expanding the war of aggression." The Northeast Electric Power Trade Union also issued a statement saying: "We are determined to strengthen unity, work hard in production, and ensure electricity supply for industry and mining to crush U.S. imperialism's aggression."

Employees of the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, No. 5 Machine Tool Plant, No. 6 Machine Tool Plant, and No. 4 Machine Tool Plant under the Northeast Machinery Administration have recently held discussion meetings and written letters to newspapers expressing their determination to oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression. A letter from all employees of the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant said: "We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and cannot ignore this act of expanded aggression by the U.S. imperialists. We are determined to do a good job in production, do our work well, and complete our tasks ahead of schedule to support the Korean people and safeguard the security of our motherland." A letter from the No. 6 Machine Tool Plant said: "This robber-like behavior of the U.S. imperialists in slaughtering people is unacceptable to peace-loving people all over the world, and the working class cannot agree to it even more. We must turn our anger into strength and use practical actions to complete our production tasks ahead of schedule to strike back at U.S. imperialism." Wang Caiyu, a technician at the No. 4 Machine Tool Plant, wrote: "I will definitely cooperate closely with the workers to study and improve technology, reduce costs, and increase output." Workers at the Nail Factory, No. 5 Machine Tool Plant, and Rubber Factory No. 7 under the Light Industry Administration are determined to answer U.S. imperialist acts of aggression with practical actions to complete their tasks ahead of schedule and contribute labor. Workers at the Nail Factory decided to contribute three days of labor, and the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant decided to contribute one day of labor. More than 4,000 employees of units under the Clothing Bureau guaranteed to complete the winter clothing production task, increase the country's economic and defense strength, and smash U.S. imperialism's acts of expanded aggression.

Workers in Andong City launched a patriotic movement to step up production. Employees of various factories and mines have formulated plans to complete their October production tasks ahead of schedule. The carding machine at the Danhua Match Factory increased from 8.38 catties per cart per day to 8.64 catties, creating a new record for the factory. After holding rallies to protest against the U.S. air raids, the quality and quantity of products continued to increase in various factories under the Guanghua Dyeing and Weaving Factory. Xu Guolan, a winding worker, created a record of winding thirteen bundles of yarn in one day. All employees of the Eleventh Silk Reeling Factory in Liaodong Province also launched a fervent production competition, exceeding the plan by more than 1.1 million catties in September and striving to create even more brilliant achievements in October.

Li Fengchang, a model rescuer from the Yingjiangnan Chemical Plant in Jilin Province, said: "The U.S. imperialists' brutal acts of aggression are unacceptable to every Chinese person. We workers are determined to take practical actions in production to strike at the U.S. imperialists."

All employees of the Northeast No. 2 Woolen Mill in Harbin City are determined to work hard in production under the leadership of the Management Committee to answer U.S. imperialist provocations. The weaving, carding, and spinning groups of the factory have all challenged other groups, guaranteeing to complete their production tasks ahead of schedule.

The trade union chairmen of 32 counties in Heilongjiang Province spoke passionately on behalf of the workers of each county at a current affairs discussion meeting convened by the Heilongjiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, exposing the U.S. imperialists' plot to deliberately expand the war of aggression, threaten our border areas, and enslave the people of Asia. Chen Changrong, chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, said: "The U.S. imperialists launched a war of aggression in Korea and have repeatedly violated our airspace. Isn't this clearly wanting to invade China after invading Korea? We, the working class, must counter this frantic action of U.S. imperialism with more production!"

Workers at the Lushun Dry Dock decided to complete their annual production plan on November 7th - the great October Revolution Day - and increase labor productivity by 14% on the existing basis to show the U.S. imperialists the power of the Chinese people that cannot be insulted. In the competition, 16 advanced workers, including Zhao Tingkui, Lin Junying, Sun Hengyuan, and Han Xingkui, have emerged and have gloriously overfulfilled their annual tasks. The U.S. imperialists' series of aggressive crimes have also aroused the anger of workers in private factories in Lushun and Dalian. Li Zhongyi, a worker in the iron industry, said: "Our entire Chinese people have united and stood up! If any imperialist dares to touch a hair on our heads, then we will definitely make them suffer a bloody nose!" Xue Dianfu, chairman of the industry's trade union, called on all workers to turn their anger into strength and work hard in production.

Zhang Yuxian, a 17-year-old female Communist Party member and worker at the Yingkou No. 5 Textile Factory, said at a discussion meeting against the U.S. imperialists' acts of aggression: "We resolutely oppose U.S. imperialist aggression. We textile factory workers should spin more yarn and weave more cloth to strengthen the economy and consolidate national defense."

Young workers in many factories in Northeast China are increasing production to defend peace. All the young workers and Youth League members of the Wafangdian Ball Bearing Factory, under the leadership of the trade union, actively participated in the friendship competition of advanced Ma Hengchang-style groups. Young workers and Youth League members of the Northeast No. 8 Rubber Factory protested against U.S. imperialist crimes of aggression with practical actions. The Han Yuqin model group emerged in the factory. The group originally planned to manufacture 730 pairs of rubber shoes, but actually produced 990 pairs, and the quality fully met the standards.

Employees of Northeast May 1st Factory, May 3rd Factory, Electrical Engineering Sixth Factory Medium-Sized Motor Factory, Benxi Electric Power Bureau, Qiqihar San Yi Factory, Shenyang Machinery Factory, Jinzhou Textile Factory, and Shenyang Paint Factory Branch have all written letters to newspapers expressing their determination to resist U.S. imperialism with practical actions.
