Dulles: Banker, Slave Owner, Warmonger
    Malek
    John Foster Dulles, besides his banking and monopolistic activities, is also one of the more cunning members of the cynical imperialist demons. They are now plotting to plunge the people into a third world war. It is by no means accidental that Dulles serves as a political advisor and consultant to Truman and Acheson, and is now also a U.S. representative to the United Nations General Assembly.

    As the old saying goes, "Know a man by the company he keeps." Let us take a look at Dulles's circle of friends. This group includes not only the usual thugs, who, like summer flies, swarm on the manure pile of American big business, but also "famous" living and dead international thugs, such as Hitler, Mussolini, Churchill, Franco, Pilsudski, Syngman Rhee, the pocket dictators of South America, and the corrupt politicians and spies in the Marshallized countries of Europe, and so on.

    Through his activities in the big banking world, Dulles is involved with this group of figures. He is a lawyer for the largest law firm in the United States. The offices of this company occupy six floors of a building at 48 Wall Street, a rather interesting address.

    From those offices, Dulles conducts business for the Schroder Bank. According to the American magazine *Time*, this bank was the "economic supporter of the Rome-Berlin Axis." Since his friend Franco seized power in Spain, Mr. Dulles's company has also started doing business for the Bank of Spain.

    Dulles is also a director of the International Nickel Company, with a capital of $300 million. Due to his connection with the American Metal Company, he controls a portion of the copper industry, especially the copper mines in Northern Rhodesia, Africa. These mines employ thousands of black people who are subjected to terrible exploitation.

    Dulles's financial and political support for Hitler continued from 1920 to 1940, even during the war. Senator Pepper once stated, "One of Mr. Dulles's relationships is his dealings with the banking circles that rescued Hitler... and established Hitler's Nazi Party. I think the American people are particularly entitled to know about this relationship."

    At the beginning of World War II, one of the most active and powerful fascist groups in the United States was the "America First" committee, which had a very nice-sounding name. This group was supported by Dulles, and its main function was to slander the Soviet Union.

    The chief propagandist of "America First" was a woman named Ingaolls, who was later convicted as a spy for being employed by the Hitler gang. Another member, Bool Quirk, was also convicted of accepting $10,000 from the Hitler government. A prominent "America First" member, the "journalist" Townsend, was an agent employed by Japan. This is truly a group of fine friends for someone who holds a high position in the U.S. government!

    Running between murderers, atomic maniacs, and all kinds of traitors for six days a week, Mr. Dulles apparently feels the need for "spiritual" refreshment on the Sabbath. This may explain why he is a "leader" of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America.

    On April 6 of this year, John Foster Dulles was appointed as a political advisor to Truman and Acheson. As later events showed, this appointment was directly related to the preparation for the U.S. armed aggression against Korea. Dulles was a guest in Seoul and Tokyo a few days before North Korea was invaded. There, together with MacArthur, he issued his final instructions to the South Korean puppets.

    This monster, whose ill-gotten wealth helped Hitler to power, whose hands are stained with the blood of the people of Europe, China, and Korea, is now funding the extremely reactionary "brotherhood" organized by former Hitler's generals and officers, which is the core of the West German mercenary army. The establishment of this organization is part of the American preparation for a new world war.

    But times have changed. The people of all countries are no longer the same as before. Millions of people fighting for peace will bring Dulles and other atomic maniacs to justice.

　　杜勒斯：银行家、奴隶主、战争贩子
    马莱克
    约翰·福斯特·杜勒斯，除了他的银行和垄断活动之外，还是愤世嫉俗的帝国主义群魔中的较奸险一员。他们现正阴谋把人民投入第三次世界大战之中。杜勒斯的充任杜鲁门和艾奇逊的政治顾问和咨议之职，而且现在又身为联合国大会的美国代表，这是绝非偶然的。
    古语说道：“观其友，知其人”。让我们看一看杜勒斯的交游吧。这一群人，不但包括了寻常的匪徒，他们象夏天的苍蝇，麇集在美国大买卖的粪堆上；而且包括了“闻名”的活着和死了的国际匪徒，诸如希特勒、墨索里尼、邱吉尔、佛朗哥、毕苏斯基、李承晚、南美的袖珍独裁者们，以及欧洲马歇尔化国家里面的贪污政客和间谍分子等等之流。
    通过他在大银行界的活动，杜勒斯侧身于这一群人物之中。他是美国最大律师公司的律师。这个公司的办公室，占据楼房六层，设在华尔街四十八号，地址怪有趣的。
    从那些办公室里，杜勒斯替舒洛特银行经营生意。根据美国《时代》杂志，这个银行是“罗马——柏林轴心的经济支援者”。自从他的朋友佛朗哥在西班牙霸占政权以后，杜勒斯先生的公司，又开始替西班牙银行做买卖了。
    杜勒斯又是资金三亿美元的国际镍公司的理事。由于他与美国五金公司的连系，他掌握了一部分铜业，尤其是非洲的北罗得西亚地方的铜矿。这些矿山雇用的成千的黑人，受着可怕的剥削。
    杜勒斯对希特勒财政政治上的支持，从一九二○年至一九四○年，甚至于在战争时期，一直继续着。参议员贝泼尔曾一度声称：“杜勒斯先生的关系之一，是他与那些拯救希特勒……和建立希特勒的纳粹党的银行界的往来。这种关系，我想美国人民是特别有权利知道的。”
    第二次世界大战之初，美国最活跃和最有势力的法西斯团体之一，就是那个名字很好听的“美国第一”。这个团体是杜勒斯所支持的，它的主要作用就是诽谤苏联。
    “美国第一”的首要宣传家，是一个名叫茵高尔斯的妇人，后来，因为受雇于希特勒匪帮，作了一名间谍，被判了罪。另一会员布尔屈，因为接受希特勒政府一万美元，也定了罪。杰出的“美国第一”会员，“新闻工作者”的汤生德，是一个受雇于日本的代理人。对于一位高据美国政府机构的要职的人，这真是一群高朋良友！
    奔走于杀人犯，原子狂者和各种各式的卖国贼之间，每周达六天之多，杜勒斯先生显然感到在安息日有“精神上”舒畅一番的必要。这点或者可以用来解释为什么他身为美国教会联合会的“领袖”的原因。
    今年四月六日，约翰·福斯特·杜勒斯被委任为杜鲁门和艾奇逊的政治顾问。一如后来的事件所显示的，这次委任，对美国武装侵略朝鲜的准备，有直接关系。北朝鲜被进犯的前几天，杜勒斯在汉城和东京作客。在那里，他和麦克阿瑟一起，向南朝鲜的傀儡们发出他最后的指示。
    这个怪物，他的不义之财帮助了希特勒执政，他的双手浸渍在欧洲、中国和朝鲜人民的血泊中，现在正在资助由以前的希特勒的将军、校官们所组织的极端反动的“兄弟会”，这是西德雇佣军队的核心。这个组织的成立，是美国准备新的世界大战的一部分。
    但是，时代已经改变了。各国人民，已不和从前一样了。千百万为和平而奋斗的人，将使杜勒斯和其他原子狂者就范。
