Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 24th: London dispatch: The Chinese People's Delegation, currently visiting Britain at the invitation of the British-Chinese Friendship Association, was invited by Philip, the General Secretary of the British Labour Party, yesterday to meet and have lunch at Transport House with Philip and British Labour Party representatives (including Ms. Bacon, Chairman of the Labour Party Executive Committee, Labour Party Executive Committee members: Dalton - Minister of Town and Country Planning of the British Government, Summerskill - Minister of National Insurance, Bevan - Minister of Health, Shinwell - Minister of Defence, etc.). Liu Ningyi, head of the delegation and Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered the following speech on behalf of the delegation:

　　"We, the Chinese People's Delegation, are here at the invitation of the British-Chinese Friendship Association to attend the significant conference on October 1st celebrating the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The warm welcome we have received from the people of your country wherever we have been proves that there is a deep friendship between the people of our two countries.

　　"It is the wish of the Chinese people to establish diplomatic and trade relations between China and Britain on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty. We would like to take this opportunity to explain to you the Chinese people's views on the policies of the British government.

　　"We Chinese people believe that the foreign policy pursued by the British government has created obstacles to the development of relations between China and Britain. We Chinese people believe that the British government is in fact unfriendly to the new China, because the British government has not yet severed all relations with the Kuomintang remnant bandits, and the British authorities in Hong Kong and Malaya are implementing measures of persecution against the Chinese people residing there.

　　"We Chinese people have found that on all important international issues, the British government has always followed, and still follows, the United States step by step. The policy of the United States government is a policy of aggression, a policy of undermining world peace. We firmly oppose this imperialist policy.

　　"The British government has participated in the American armed aggression in Korea. The Korean people's struggle for liberation and independence is a just struggle. Korea is our neighbor. We cannot ignore the Korean people's struggle against foreign aggression and must express our sympathy and support. The British proposal on Korea in the United Nations General Assembly is intended to cover up and further carry out the war of aggression in Korea. This proposal will only arouse the indignation of our people and force us to strengthen our efforts to support the Korean people's struggle against aggression.

　　"I would like to thank you on behalf of the Chinese People's Delegation for your invitation and for the opportunity to express our people's views to you frankly and sincerely."

    中国人民反对英政府追随美国的帝国主义政策我们对于朝鲜人民抵抗侵略的斗争要加强支援
    【新华社布拉格二十四日电】伦敦消息：现正应英中友好协会之请，访问英国的中国人民代表团，应英国工党总书记菲利浦之邀，昨日在运输大厦与菲利浦及英国工党代表（包括工党执委会主席培根女士，工党执委：达尔顿——英政府城乡计划大臣，萨末斯基尔——国民保险大臣，比万——卫生大臣，辛威尔——国防大臣等人）会晤，并同进午餐。代表团团长、中华全国总工会副主席刘宁一代表代表团发表谈话如下：
    “我们，中国人民代表团应英中友好协会之请，来英出席十月一日庆祝中华人民共和国开国一周年纪念的有重大意义的大会。在我们所到之处，贵国人民所给予我们的热烈欢迎，证明在我们两国人民之间，是存在着深厚的友谊的。
    “中英两国之间能在平等互利及互相尊重领土主权的基础上建立外交关系及贸易关系，乃是中国人民的愿望。我们愿意趁这次集会，向你们说明中国人民对英国政府的政策的意见。
    “我们中国人民认为：英国政府所实行的外交政策，使中英两国关系的开展，有了障碍。我们中国人民认为：英国政府实际上对新中国是不友好的，因为英国政府直到目前还没有和国民党残余匪帮断绝一切关系，而且在香港及马来亚等地的英国当局，对居住当地的中国人民正在实行迫害的措施。
    “我们中国人民发现：在一切重要的国际问题上，英国政府以往一直在、而且现在仍然在随着美国而亦步亦趋。美国政府的政策是侵略的政策，是破坏世界和平的政策。我们坚决反对这种帝国主义政策。
    “英国政府参与了美国在朝鲜的武装侵略。朝鲜人民争取解放与独立的斗争是正义的斗争。朝鲜是我们的邻人。我们对于朝鲜人民抵抗外国侵略的斗争，不能置之不理，一定要表示同情并予以支援。英国在联合国大会中所提出关于朝鲜的提案，其目的是要掩饰并进一步进行在朝鲜的侵略战争。这种提案只会激起我国人民的义愤，并迫使我们加强支援朝鲜人民反侵略斗争的努力。
    “我愿意代表中国人民代表团，感谢你们的邀请，并感谢得有这机会率直而诚挚地向你们表达我国人民的意见。”
