Don't Be Complacent After a Good Harvest!
    Cadres in the Fifth and Sixth Districts of Dehui County, Jilin Province, Relaxed Production Leadership, and the Masses Did Not Harvest Carefully, Resulting in a Lot of Grain Loss.
    [Our Newspaper] In the Fifth and Sixth Districts of Dehui County, Jilin Province, due to complacency and carelessness resulting from a good harvest, crops were wasted a lot. The two districts generally started the autumn harvest in mid-September. Although there was an early frost this year, and the crops in the low-lying areas were not fully mature, the implementation of three hoeings and three harrowings (some reaching three hoeings and four harrowings), as well as seed selection, disinfection, and topdressing, improved farming conditions and agricultural techniques. In addition, the rainfall was even this year, generally resulting in 80% to 90% of a normal harvest.
    Because of the good harvest, some cadres and the masses became complacent, which affected the successful completion of the autumn harvest. For example, some district and village cadres harbored thoughts such as: "The grain is already in hand, the food is already in the mouth, even without leadership, it won't be thrown on the ground," and "This year is a good year, everyone is working hard, there are no problems," relaxing their leadership over the autumn harvest, allowing it to proceed without guidance. As a result, complacency also arose among the masses, who believed: "A good harvest is not afraid of bird pecking," "Crows can't steal you poor, rats can't rob you poor"; "This year is a good year, a little bit of difference doesn't matter." Therefore, the phenomenon of wasting grain existed relatively commonly and seriously. For example, after Cui Zhenjiang of Biangang Village finished shelling the corn, the women spent only two hours picking out two sacks and one carrying basket of corn cobs from one hectare of land, which could yield more than one斗 (dǒu, a unit of dry volume). In Wang Shiying's corn and soybean field in Shangtaizi Village, the bean pods were crushed by carts when hauling the corn. When asked why he did this, he said: "It's not a lot of waste, it doesn't matter." During the autumn harvest, all the horses in the village were not wearing halters and were eating randomly in the fields. One horse wasted at least one升 (shēng, a unit of dry volume) of grain a day. Some of the masses also had the idea of "not being in a hurry," thinking: "The later the corn is harvested, the drier it will be," "Corn is not afraid of being overripe." They only harvested sorghum and millet first, leaving the corn in the field unattended, pecked by crows and dug up by dogs, causing a lot of damage. Others shelled the cobs at the edge of the field but did not haul them home, resulting in even greater losses. After the county party committee's work team discovered these phenomena, they immediately worked with the district party committee to study ways to overcome them, and are now using various methods to carry out in-depth publicity and mobilization to correct them.

　　丰收不要自满！
    吉林德惠县五六两区干部放松生产领导，群众不细心收割，粮食损失很多。
    【本报讯】吉林省德惠县五、六两区由于丰收而自满麻痹、不细心收割，使庄稼糟蹋很多。该两区于九月中旬普遍开始秋收。虽今年霜早，洼地庄稼未能十分成熟，但由于实行了三铲三趟（部分达到三铲四趟）及选种、消毒、上追肥等，提高了耕作条件，改进了农业技术，又加今年雨水调匀，一般仍不下八、九成年景。
    因为庄稼丰收，使部分干部和群众产生了自满情绪，影响很好的完成秋收工作。如部分区村干部存有：“到手的粮食到口的饭，不用领导也扔不到地里”，“今年年景好，大伙干的都挺起劲，没啥问题了”等麻痹乐观思想，放松了对秋收的领导，使之陷于自流。从而群众中也就产生了自满情绪，认为：“丰收不怕雀弹”，“老鸦叨不穷，老鼠盗不穷”；“今年是好年头，差个一星半点没啥”。因此糟蹋粮食的现象，较普遍和严重地存在着。如边岗村崔振江的苞米擘完以后，妇女们只用两个钟头的时间，在一垧地里就检出了两麻袋另一抬筐苞米穗，约能打一斗多。上台子屯王世英的苞米带豆的地里，因为拉苞米，大车把豆荚都压坏了。别人问他为什么这样，他说：“糟蹋不多，不要紧。”在秋收中，全村的马都不带笼头，到地里乱吃，一天一匹马至少得糟蹋一升粮食。个别群众还有“不着忙”的思想，认为：“苞米越晚割越干”，“苞米不怕熟过劲。”就只管先割高粱、谷子，把苞米扔到地里不管，老鸦叨，狗也扒，损害不少。还有的把穗擘到地头不往家拉，损失更多。这些现象经县委工作组发现后，立即协同区委研究克服办法，现正利用各种方式，深入宣传动员予以纠正。（于洪波）
