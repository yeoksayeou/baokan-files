　　Correct Deviations at Any Time, Gradually Clarify Policies:
    Rectification Progresses Steadily in North China
    Rectification of Cadres Above County Level to Conclude by End of October
    [Our Newspaper Dispatches] Reporter Shang Kai reports: The rectification movement in various areas of the North China Administrative Region has been launched in depth. On May 28th, the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee issued the "Decision on Implementing the Central Committee's Instructions on Rectifying the Party and Cadres." The provinces began rectification studies in July, adopting basically three methods of rectification: Hebei and Inner Mongolia mainly used on-the-job rectification supplemented by centralized training of a few key members. In the provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, and Pingyuan, rectification meetings or Party Congresses were first convened at all levels to train key rectification members, who then returned to their work posts to conduct rectification. Shanxi mainly adopted the method of rotational training, with cadres above the district level leaving their work posts and concentrating in batches at the Provincial Party Committee and the Prefectural Party Committee for rectification for a period of one and a half months, after which they would return to their offices to rectify their work. Currently, the rectification of the North China Bureau organs has concluded. The Chahar rectification and inspection summary phase for organs above the county level has basically concluded, and plans for improving work have been formulated. Most counties in Hebei and Suiyuan are nearing completion. The Pingyuan Provincial Party Committee's rectification conference is underway. Inner Mongolia is currently inspecting work. The rectification of cadres above the county level in the entire region is scheduled to be completed by the end of October. This winter and next spring, efforts will be made to rectify district and village cadres and grassroots Party organizations.
    The entire region's rectification movement generally proceeds in accordance with the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the North China Bureau. The main problems in the work are identified for analysis. Achievements are correctly assessed, shortcomings and errors are conscientiously examined, and criticism and self-criticism are gradually unfolded. In the movement, the North China Bureau and the provincial Party committees constantly prevent and correct the occurrence of deviations and errors, so progress is relatively smooth. During the rectification movement, various localities have revealed bureaucratism, coercive commandism, and serious violations of policies that detach them from the masses, through inspection and summarization of work. Bureaucratic work styles are mainly manifested in the unscientific working methods of leading organs and cadres: they cannot grasp the center of the work, they are busy with affairs and paperwork all day long, they do not understand the situation at the lower levels, they do not study policies, the tasks assigned are not practical, there are many instructions, many meetings, many forms, and little specific help, inspection, and summarization. In the execution of various work tasks, some cadres, in order to complete their tasks, do not hesitate to use crude and overbearing methods to force the masses to carry out the tasks, resulting in frequent incidents of beating and scolding the masses and infringing on human rights. In the financial and economic departments, serious damage to state assets has been discovered. In public security and judicial work, the execution of policies is "boundlessly lenient," and cases are backlogged, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. The Anze County Court in Shanxi has even accumulated cases from 1946 that have not yet been processed, and other county courts have similar situations. After preliminary rectification, the policy and ideological levels and work efficiency of the organs and cadres have generally improved, and the work style has also changed to some extent. The coercive commandism in this year's summer grain requisition has obviously decreased.
    The rectification experience in the entire region proves that the primary key to the correct progress of rectification is to first determine the focus of rectification and formulate a specific rectification plan. This plan must proceed from the actual situation of the region or department and determine different content and focus. In the initial stage of rectification, most regions failed to formulate a practical rectification plan based on analysis of their own regional situation; they simply copied the instructions and resolutions of the higher levels, or even wrote long and verbose articles. There were many such phenomena in Hebei Province. For example, the rectification plan of the Lingshou County Party Committee was as long as 8,000 characters, and the rectification plan of the Shenze County Party Committee was as long as 6,000 characters, but neither proposed what problems the county should focus on solving in this rectification. After discovering this situation, the North China Bureau immediately instructed the provincial Party committees to resolutely overcome formalism and strictly review the rectification plans of their subordinate Party committees at all levels. Those that were found to be not in line with reality were required to be revised. After correcting this deviation, the rectification movement in various localities progressed more smoothly.
    The rectification experience in the entire region similarly proves that documents must be studied in conjunction with reality. Only in this way can the spirit and essence of the documents be truly understood, and the position, viewpoints, and methods for analyzing problems can be grasped. However, it must also be noted that after entering the study of documents and initially exposing problems, a timely transition to work inspection should be made, and relevant documents should still be studied during the inspection work. In the early stage of the rectification movement, various localities had the deviation of studying documents in isolation from reality. Hebei was more serious in this regard. They generally spent a month studying documents. In many areas, because the study time was long and the idea of linking the study of documents with reality was not clear, they fell into the trap of rote memorization of terms or endlessly arguing over some minor issues. The Ding County Agricultural Science Section discussed the phrase "not using the mind" for a whole morning. These phenomena were corrected by the provinces at any time. Inner Mongolia accepted the experience of various localities and stipulated in the study plan at the beginning of the rectification study: to prevent the deviation of studying in isolation from reality, and not studying or seeking a thorough understanding.
    Rectification must be combined with current work. Various localities should specifically determine the steps and time for rectification based on the importance and urgency of their work, and should not force the complete uniformity of the rectification progress of the entire province, region, or county, so as not to separate rectification from current work or even create opposition. For example, departments with no urgent tasks, such as judicial, taxation, and supply and marketing cooperatives, can carry out inspection work on schedule, but in areas with serious disasters and departments with urgent tasks, efforts should first be concentrated on flood control and disaster relief work, implementing the spirit of rectification in the work, and then concentrating efforts on inspecting work after the work has come to an end. At the same time, attention should be paid to the agricultural production season. In some counties in Chahar South, the leadership of the current work of weeding, flood prevention, and afforestation was relaxed because cadres were concentrated on rectification, such as in Huailai County, where the leadership was only busy with rectification, causing the "three autumns" work to fall into a state of self-flow, failing to achieve immediate harvesting and plowing, and some areas suffered great losses. After discovering the above situation, the Provincial Party Committee immediately instructed all localities to pay attention to prevention and correction. In Jining and Longsheng counties in Suiyuan, there was also the deviation of closing the door for rectification and allowing the insect plague to spread. In the early stage of rectification, the cadres of the Zhengding County Party Committee in Hebei Province were still sitting in the house discussing the Party's mass line when the river embankment outside the city was in danger.
    The inspection work must grasp the key points, that is, grasp the working characteristics of different departments and different regions, and key issues with important policy implications, and conduct in-depth inspection. Analyze the causes, distinguish right from wrong, and determine practical improvement measures. Regions that adopt this method generally achieve better results. However, there are also many regions that blindly carry out formalistic inspections, such as the Datong Municipal Party Committee in Chahar Province, which formulated four major items and twenty-one minor items for the inspection of industrial and mining enterprises. Quyang and Raoyang counties in Hebei Province also stipulated the inspection of five major tasks: agriculture, industry, taxation, culture and education, and public security, each of which was divided into many small items. Covering all aspects, it is impossible to see what the important issues are. In the inspection work in some counties and units in Hebei and Suiyuan, hats were first put on, and then facts were sought to list phenomena, resulting in many clauses, a wide scope, but a lack of in-depth analysis and review, and nothing was resolved. At the same time, the phenomenon of "rectifying the lower levels but not the upper levels" and isolated inspection of individuals also occurred in some areas. The Tong County Egg Farm in Hebei even made an administrator the "focus of inspection." Pingshan County remained in isolated study of documents and carried out inspection and reflection on personal problems for a long time in two months. The first phase of cadre training in the Xinxian Prefectural Party Committee in Shanxi also focused more on inspecting individuals. The Yuci Prefectural Party Committee even regarded this approach as experience. These practices are not in line with the spirit and requirements of this rectification.
    In rectification, it is necessary to fully promote democracy and deeply carry out criticism and self-criticism. Leading cadres should first set an example, conduct an inspection report on the work of their own department in the spirit of self-criticism, and inspire and guide everyone to speak boldly, so that the mass criticism from bottom to top is combined with the inspection and summary work from top to bottom. Beijing checked the work style of cadres through people's representative conferences; many county Party committees in Chahar South absorbed capable and upright village cadres to participate in rectification meetings, and the results were very good. However, there are still many areas where democracy is not promoted enough, and even some deviations have occurred, which have affected the in-depth development of the rectification movement. For example, the Finance Department of the Hebei Provincial Government and the Education Bureau of Zhangjiakou City have mistakenly asked leading cadres to recuse themselves during inspection work in order to allow everyone to make suggestions. When inspecting work in the Yanbei Special District, some cadres suggested that "the two commissioners have disagreements, which affects work," and Commissioner Yao immediately found the cadres who made the suggestions to explain, making everyone think that the leadership could not humbly consider the suggestions. Even more wrongly, the cooperative of the special commissioner's office used punishment of cadres as a means to guide everyone to speak. These situations have been corrected after being discovered by the Provincial Party Committee.
    Improve work while rectifying. Experience has proven that the method of on-the-job rectification in Hebei Province is convenient for inspecting work and is closely related to current work, which can improve work while rectifying, and is suitable for the requirements of this rectification. The grain depots of the Huolu, Shulu, and Shijiazhuang special commissioner's offices have made significant achievements in this regard. However, it is necessary to strengthen organizational leadership, otherwise it is difficult to implement the spirit of rectification. The Ding County Prefectural Party Committee timely convened county secretary meetings to exchange experiences and correct deviations. This specific leadership is easy for the counties to accept. It is also necessary for Chahar, Suiyuan, Pingyuan and other provinces to hold rectification meetings first to train key rectification members. However, the time should not be too long. In Shanxi, cadres are separated from their work posts for centralized rectification, do not understand each other, and cannot combine with mass criticism from bottom to top, making it difficult to systematically inspect work. At the same time, cadres are separated from their work posts for a long time, and daily work will inevitably be affected. Later, the North China Bureau instructed the province that even cadres who had participated in centralized rectification should still inspect work by department after returning.

　　随时纠正偏向逐步明确方针
    华北各地整风稳步前进
    县以上干部整风将于十月底结束
    【本报讯】记者商恺报道：华北大行政区各地整风运动已深入展开。五月二十八日，中共中央华北局发布了“关于执行中央整党整干指示”的决定，各省于七月份先后开始整风学习，各地基本上采取了三种整风方式：河北、内蒙主要是在职整风辅之以少数骨干的集中培养训练。察哈尔、绥远、平原三省首先召开各级整风会议或党代会议，培养整风骨干，然后返回工作岗位，进行整风。山西则主要采取轮流集训的整风方式，区以上干部离开工作岗位，分批集中于省委和地委，以一个半月时间进行整风，整完后再回机关整顿工作。目前华北局机关整风已经结束。察哈尔县以上机关整风检查总结工作阶段已基本结束，并订出改进工作计划。河北、绥远大部县份已接近结束。平原省地委整风会议正在进行。内蒙正在检查工作。全区县以上干部的整风，计划于十月底全部结束。今冬明春着手整顿区村干部及党的基层组织。
    全区整风运动，一般均能按照中共中央及华北局指示进行。抓住工作中的主要问题，进行分析。正确地估计成绩，认真地检查缺点和错误，逐步展开批评与自我批评。在运动中，华北局及各省委随时防止并纠正了偏向的发生和错误，故进展较为顺利。整风运动中各地均从检查总结工作中揭发了官僚主义与强迫命令作风，以及严重的违犯政策脱离群众的现象。官僚主义作风主要表现在领导机关和干部工作方法不科学：抓不住工作的中心，终日忙于事务和文牍，不了解下层情况，不研究政策，布置任务不切合实际，指示多，会议多，表格多，具体帮助和检查总结少。在执行各种工作任务上，有些干部为了完成任务，竟不择手段，采用粗暴蛮横的办法强迫要群众执行任务，以致打骂群众，侵犯人权的事件经常发生。在财政经济部门中，则发现了严重的损害国家资财的现象。公安司法工作中执行政策“宽大无边”，并积压案件，引起群众不满。山西安泽县法院竟积压有一九四六年的案子尚未处理，其他各县法院也有类似情况。经过初步整风的机关和干部，政策思想水平及工作效率一般均有所提高，工作作风也有所转变。今年夏征中强迫命令作风已显然减少。
    全区整风经验证明：首先确定整风重点，制订具体整风计划，是整风能否正确进展的主要关键。此项计划必须从本地区或本部门的实际情况出发，确定不同的内容和重点。整风初期各地区大多未能从分析自己地区实际情况出发，制定一个切实的整风计划；只是照抄上级指示和决议，甚至长篇大论，洋洋万言。河北省曾有不少这样现象。如灵寿县委的整风计划，长达八千字，深泽县委整风计划长达六千字，但都没有提出该县在这次整风中应着重解决什么问题。华北局发现此种情况后，即责成各省委坚决克服形式主义，严格审查所属各级党委的整风计划。经审查不切合实际者，均须重新改订。纠正了这一偏向后，各地整风运动进展即较为顺利。
    全区整风经验，同样地证明：学习文件必须联系实际。只有如此，才能真正的领会文件的精神与实质，掌握分析问题的立场、观点和方法。但也必须注意，在进入学习文件，初步暴露问题后，即应适时的转入检查工作，在检查工作中，仍须学习有关文件。在整风运动的初期，各地均曾发生脱离实际，孤立学习文件的偏向。其中以河北较为严重。他们普遍用一个月的时间学习文件。不少地区因学习时间较长，并且对学习文件联系实际的思想不明确，就陷于死钻名词，或纠缠在一些次要问题上争论不休。定县农业科曾为“无所用心”一句话，讨论了一个早上，这些现象各省都曾随时予以纠正。内蒙接受了各地经验，整风学习开始时便在学习计划中规定了：防止学习与实际脱节，和不学习、不求甚解的偏向。
    整风必须与当前工作结合。各地应根据自己工作情况的轻重缓急，具体确定整风的步骤和时间，不要强求全省或全区全县整风进度的完全统一，以免将整风与当前工作分开甚至形成对立。如司法、税收、供销社等无紧急任务部门可按期进行检查工作，但某些灾情严重地区，及有紧急任务部门，则应首先集中力量进行防汛、救灾工作，在工作中贯彻整风精神，于工作告一段落后，再集中力量检查工作。同时要注意农业生产季节。察南有些县份，因干部集中整风，对当前锄苗、防洪、造林等工作放松领导，如怀来县领导上只忙于整风，使三秋工作陷于自流，未能做到随收随耕，部分地区受了很大损失。省委发现以上情况后，随即指示各地注意防止和纠正。在绥远集宁、龙胜等县，也曾发生过关门整风，听任虫灾蔓延的偏向。河北省正定县委会机关干部，在整风的初期，城外河堤出险，他们还坐在屋里讨论党的群众路线。
    检查工作，必须抓住重点，即抓住不同部门不同地区的工作特点，及带有重要政策性的关键问题，进行深入检查。分析原因，辨明是非责任，定出切实的改进办法。各地区凡采用此种办法者，一般收效较好。但也有不少地区，盲目地进行形式主义的检查，如察省大同市委，在检查工作时，对工矿企业部门拟定了四大项二十一小项检查重点。河北省的曲阳、饶阳等县也规定检查农业、工业、税收、文教、治安等五大工作，其中每项又分许多细小节目。面面俱到，看不出什么是重要问题。河北、绥远有些县份和单位检查工作中先扣帽子，再寻找事实罗列现象，结果条文很多，范围很广，但缺乏深刻的分析与检讨，不解决什么问题。同时，某些地区也曾发生“整下不整上”，和孤立检查个人的现象。河北通县蛋场就将一个管理员当成了“检查重点”。平山县在两个月中长期停留在孤立学习文件，并进行个人问题的检查和反省。山西忻县地委第一期干部整训中也多偏重了检查个人。榆次地委甚至将这种作法当成经验。这些作法是不符合于此次整风的精神与要求的。
    整风中必须充分发扬民主，深入开展批评与自我批评。领导干部应首先以身作则，以自我批评的精神，将自己部门的工作进行一个检查报告，启发诱导大家大胆发言，使自下而上的群众性的批评，与自上而下的检查与总结工作结合起来。北京市通过人民代表会议，检查干部作风；察南不少县委吸收能力较强的正派的村干部参加整风会议，结果都起了很好的作用。但仍有不少地区，发扬民主不够，甚至发生一些偏差，使整风运动的深入开展受到影响。如河北省政府财政厅，张家口市教育局，在检查工作中都曾错误地要求领导干部进行回避，以便大家提意见。雁北专区在检查工作时，有的干部提出：“两个专员闹意见，影响工作”，姚专员便马上找提意见的干部进行解释，使大家认为领导上不能虚心考虑意见。更错误的是该专署合作社，以处分干部做为引导大家发言的手段。这些情况，省委检查发现后已予纠正。
    一面整风，一面改进工作。经验证明：河北省在职整风的办法，检查工作方便，且和当前工作密切联系，可以一面整风，一面改进工作，适合于这次整风要求。获鹿、束鹿、石家庄专署粮库，在这方面都做出显著的成绩。但须加强组织领导，否则难于贯彻整风精神，定县地委及时分片召开县书碰头会，交流经验，纠正偏向。这种具体领导，各县易于接受。察绥、平原等省先开整风会，培养整风骨干，亦属必要。但时间不宜过长。山西集中整风，干部脱离工作岗位，互不了解，更不能结合自下而上的群众批评，很难系统的检查工作，同时干部长期脱离工作岗位，日常工作必然要受到影响。后来华北局曾指示该省即使参加过集中整风的干部，回去后仍应以部门为单位检查一次工作。
