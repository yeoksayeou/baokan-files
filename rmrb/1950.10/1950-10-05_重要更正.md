　　Important Correction
    In the article "Re Wu Shi, Xinjiang Model Animal Husbandry Worker" published on page 8 of this newspaper on September 29, the second line of the last paragraph, "During the six or seven years under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang," should be corrected to "During the two years under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang." Because Re Wu Shi went to work at the veterinary hospital in 1942, and in 1944 the people of Yili launched a revolution, and the people of the three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan were liberated, with a difference of only two years. Also, the phrase "after liberation last year" in the fifth line of the same paragraph should be corrected to "after the complete liberation of Xinjiang last year." This is specially corrected.

　　重要更正
    本报九月二十九日第八版刊载“新疆牧业模范工作者热吾什”一文内，最后一段第二行“他在国民党反动统治下的六、七年中”应改为“他在国民党反动统治下的二年中”。因热吾什在一九四二年到兽医医院工作，一九四四年伊犁人民即进行革命，伊犁、塔城、阿山三区人民获得解放，相距仅二年。又同段第五行“去年解放后”，一句，应改为“去年新疆全部解放后”，特此更正。
