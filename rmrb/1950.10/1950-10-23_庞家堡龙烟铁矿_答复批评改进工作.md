    Reply to Criticism and Improvement of Work

Comrade Editor:
    We have read the letter from Comrade Li Zhenguo in the People's Garden on September 4th criticizing our mine. We now inform you of our self-criticism:
    Our mine is currently in a period of restoration and reconstruction, and therefore various safety systems, equipment, and technical regulations are not yet sound. Most of the workers are newly recruited. The main reason for the frequent accidents is that we have not paid enough attention to and strengthened leadership in this work subjectively. This year, a total of thirteen workers have been injured or killed in accidents. The liquid oxygen explosion was the biggest tragedy. The liquid oxygen explosive test is a new creation in our mine, and the technical personnel lack knowledge and experience in this area. The liquid oxygen installation and the manufacture of the containers were both unreasonable. Therefore, during transportation by truck, due to the uneven mountain roads and bumps, the load on the neck root of the inner layer of the container was too heavy, causing it to break, causing the activated carbon to absorb liquid oxygen and be ignited and explode. Now, according to the instructions of the higher authorities and the requirements of the employees, and in conjunction with the actual situation, we are vigorously carrying out the establishment of safety organizations and safety responsibility systems at all levels. At present, employees in each production unit have discussed safety regulations and have begun to implement them.
    Due to the continuous expansion of our mine and the increasing number of employees, medical equipment and medical personnel are lacking. The leadership is also responsible for not paying enough attention to this. The medical staff's attitude and style of work are not correct, and they cannot patiently explain and carefully study the source of illness for patients. This should be improved. In the past two months, we have conducted multiple inspections of medical work and established some systems. We are also hiring doctors and nurses from Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places, and purchasing medical equipment.
    Regarding the circumstances of the deaths of the four workers mentioned by Comrade Li Zhenguo in his criticism, we believe that they do not conform to the facts. Comrade Li Zhenguo is the attending physician of internal medicine in our mine's clinic, and he is invited to participate in every consultation for critically ill patients. Therefore, we believe that he should also bear certain responsibility. Secondly, we have discovered that there is a phenomenon of disunity among the doctors, which is worth our attention.

### 庞家堡龙烟铁矿  答复批评改进工作

　　庞家堡龙烟铁矿
    答复批评改进工作编辑同志：
    九月四日人民园地上李振国同志批评本矿的信件我们已读到了。现把我们的检讨告诉你们：
    本矿现正处在恢复重建时期，因而各项安全制度、设备及技术规程，均不够健全。工人大部是新招的。事故不断发生的原因，主要由于我们主观上没有很好的注意与加强领导这一工作。今年因事故而伤亡的工人共十三人。其中液氧爆炸事件是一个最大的惨剧。液氧炸药的试验，在本矿是一个新的创建，技术人员对此种知识与经验非常缺乏，在液氧的装置上和容器的制造上，都很不合理。故在汽车运送途中，因山地不平，颠波摇摆，使容器内层颈根部负荷过重而断裂，使活性炭吸收液氧后被燃爆炸。现在我们已根据上级指示和职工的要求，结合实际情况，正在大力进行各级安全组织和安全责任制的建立工作。目前，各生产单位的职工已讨论了安全条例，并已开始实施。
    由于本矿不断地扩展，职工日多，医疗设备及医务人员都感到缺乏。领导上对此注意不够亦有责任。医务人员在工作态度和作风上不够端正，对病员不能耐心解说和细心研究病源。这是应该改进的，近两月来，我们曾对医务工作进行了多次的检查，建立了一些制度。并正由京、津、沪等地聘请医师及护士人员，采办医疗器材。
    关于李振国同志在批评中所提及的四个工人的伤亡经过，我们认为是与事实不相符合的。李振国同志是我矿医务所内科主治大夫，每次会诊重病号时，都请他参加。因此我们认为他也应负一定的责任。其次，我们发觉大夫间有不团结的现象，这是值得引起我们注意的。
