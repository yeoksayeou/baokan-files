　　Appropriately Increase Prices to Take Care of Farmers' Interests
    Xuancheng Grain Company Vigorously Purchases Indica Rice
    Individual Private Merchants Violated Contracts and Suppressed Purchase Prices, Causing Farmers to Suffer Losses, and Have Been Dealt With According to Law
    [Our Newspaper] The Xuancheng Branch of the Wannan Grain Company is vigorously carrying out the work of purchasing indica rice, with an average daily purchase of more than 200,000 jin. From August 25th to September 20th, it has purchased more than 8 million jin.

    Farmers who exchange grain for money sometimes immediately purchase daily necessities, and sometimes, when there is nothing to buy, they take the Renminbi back to the countryside.

    In mid-August, the general market price of indica rice was around 50,000 yuan per dan (old scale of 100 jin). Farmers reflected: "With such a low price, you really can't buy anything with a dan of rice." In order to take care of the interests of farmers, the Grain Company started purchasing at a listed price of 66,000 yuan per dan on August 25th; and in accordance with the principle of considering both public and private interests, it signed contracts with five private grain merchants, giving private merchants a handling fee of 2.5% per 100 jin of grain, and stipulating a 5% loss (dried grain), entrusting private merchants to purchase on its behalf. However, some individual private merchants disregarded their credit and reduced the purchase price to 62,000 yuan, causing farmers to suffer a loss of 4,000 yuan per dan. Fortunately, the Grain Branch Company checked in a timely manner and discovered it early. The grain merchants who suppressed the price have been sent to the People's Government for handling according to law, and they have been ordered to return their illegally exploited portion. After hearing this news, the farmers all reflected, "The People's Government is really thinking about the interests of the people in everything."

    In the purchase work, a major shortcoming also occurred: due to insufficient preparation work in advance, the warehouses were not sufficient, resulting in the area in front of the Grain Company being very crowded. Some farmers from afar were unable to sell for a while, so they had to carry their grain and spend the night in front of the company. During the busy farming season, some farmers were eager to sell their grain and go home, and were forced to sell their grain to vendors at low prices, enduring an additional layer of exploitation. This shortcoming, which is technical but has a great impact, should be corrected by the Xuancheng Branch Company in a timely manner.

　　适当提高价格照顾农民利益
    宣城粮食公司大力收购籼稻
    个别私商违背合同压价收购使农民吃亏已依法处理
    【本报讯】皖南粮食公司宣城支公司，大力开展收购籼稻的工作，每天平均收购二十多万斤。自八月二十五日至九月二十日，已收购八百余万斤。
    农民用粮食换成钱，有的随手购买了日用必需品，有的一时没有东西可买，便把人民币带下乡去。
    八月中旬，市场上一般籼稻价格为每担（老秤一百斤）五万元左右，农民反映：“价钱这么低，卖了一担稻，真买不着什么东西。”粮食公司为照顾农民利益，在八月二十五日以每担六万六千元的牌价开始收购；并根据公私兼顾的原则，与五家私营粮商订立合同，每百斤谷给予私商百分之二点五的手续费，并规定百分之五的蚀耗（晒成干谷），委托私商代购。但有个别私商不顾信用，曾把收购价格压低到六万二千元使农民每担遭受四千元的损失。幸粮食支公司及时检查，发觉较早，已依法将压价收购的粮商送人民政府处理，并限令他们归还其非法剥削部分。农民们听到这个消息后，都反映说：“人民政府真是处处为人民利益着想的”。
    在收购工作中，也发生了一个较大的缺点：由于事先准备工作不足，仓库不敷使用，以致粮食公司门前非常拥挤，有些远道农民一时卖不了，只得挑着谷子在公司门前过夜。在农忙时，有些农民急于售完粮食回家，被迫以低价把粮食卖给小贩，忍受一重中间剥削。这种属于技术性但是影响很大的缺点，宣城支公司应该及时设法纠正。
