　　Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship and Cooperation
    Li Xiuzhen
    Time flies! The establishment of our Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has already been a year ago. In this year, I have a more thorough and deeper understanding of the great significance of the sincere friendship and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. The great friendship between China and the Soviet Union is completely based on equality, mutual assistance, and mutual respect. The unprecedentedly powerful unity of the 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union is the most reliable guarantee for preventing aggression and defending peace.
    Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we, the entire Chinese people, must resolutely support and thoroughly implement our "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance," and we must humbly learn from and emulate our Soviet brothers and sisters.
    Long live the friendship between China and the Soviet Union!
    Long live the liberation of the people of the world!

　　中苏友好合作万岁
    李秀真    
    光阴真快！我们中苏友好协会的成立已经有一周年的历史了。在这一年里边，我对于中苏两国真诚友好合作的重大意义，更有透彻和深入的认识。中苏两国的伟大友谊，是完全建立在平等、互助与相互尊重的基础上的。中苏两国七亿人民空前强大的团结，是防止侵略保卫和平的最最可靠的保证。
    我们全中国人民，在共产党毛主席的英明领导下，要坚决拥护、彻底实现我们《中苏友好同盟互助条约》，要虚心向苏联友邦的兄弟姊妹们学习看齐。
    中苏两国友好万岁！
    全世界人民解放万岁！
