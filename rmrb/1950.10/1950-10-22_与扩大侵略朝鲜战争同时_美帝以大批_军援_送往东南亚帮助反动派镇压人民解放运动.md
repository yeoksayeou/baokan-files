Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Simultaneously with expanding its war of aggression in Korea, American imperialism is shipping munitions and weapons to Southeast Asian countries, attempting to suppress the national liberation movements of the peoples of Southeast Asia.

The main targets of American imperialism's "military aid" in Southeast Asia are the French colonial army and the Bao Dai puppet regime, which are already in dire straits in Vietnam. The recent disastrous defeat of the French colonial army in North Vietnam has made American imperialists even more anxious and determined to step up the shipment of weapons of slaughter to Vietnam. According to a Agence France-Presse dispatch from Honolulu on the 16th, when Truman and MacArthur recently discussed plans for a full-scale invasion of Asia on Wake Island, they "decided to strengthen the shipment of weapons and materials to the French and Vietnamese armies." The message also revealed that "five ships carrying war materials are already en route to Indochina." According to a United Press dispatch from Saigon on the 15th, "An American cargo ship carrying weapons to supply the heavily pressured French and Vietnamese forces arrived in southern Indochina on the evening of the 15th; a second cargo ship will arrive in Saigon within the week carrying new weapons." An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington on the 14th stated: "The United States will send a squadron of light bombers and landing craft to Indochina within a few weeks. The U.S. Department of Defense will also do its best to accelerate the transportation of materials related to this aid."

American imperialism's open large-scale "aid" to the French army and Bao Dai in Vietnam began as early as January this year after American "roving ambassador" Jessup conducted aggressive activities in Vietnam. According to Agence France-Presse, the total amount of aid was determined to be around 30 million U.S. dollars. The first batch of military "aid," including aircraft, automatic weapons, and amphibious transportation equipment, began shipping from the United States in July. On August 10, the American ship "Iron Steed," loaded with American "military aid," arrived in Saigon. By early September, the American military supplies shipped to Indochina were enough to equip twelve motorized battalions.

Another target of American imperialism's military "aid" is the Philippines, which is under its direct control. Since the launch of the war of aggression against Korea, American imperialism had shipped no less than three batches of "military aid" to the Philippines by the end of July. According to the "Philippine-American Mutual Defense Program," on September 20, another 100 tons of American "military aid" materials arrived in the Philippines, including armored vehicles, trucks, and radio equipment. By mid-September, the Philippines had already received 252,254,614 pesos worth of American military "aid" (2 pesos equals one U.S. dollar).

After the U.S. military mission led by Melby "visited" Thailand, American imperialism is stepping up the arming of the Luang Phibuns government's army. U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Stanton and Thai Prime Minister Luang Phibuns signed a "Military Assistance Agreement" in Bangkok on October 17. The agreement stipulates that the United States will provide Thailand with weapons and equipment, and "provide some officers and technical personnel" to train the Thai reactionary army. Luang Phibuns told reporters from the Bangkok Tribune on September 20 that the United States would give Thailand $30 million worth of weapons, enough to equip nine battalions.

　　与扩大侵略朝鲜战争同时
    美帝以大批“军援”送往东南亚帮助反动派镇压人民解放运动
    【新华社二十日讯】美帝国主义者与扩大侵略朝鲜战争同时，正运送军火武器到东南亚各国，企图镇压东南亚各国人民的民族解放运动。
    美帝国主义在东南亚“军事援助”的主要对象，是在越南已经日暮途穷的法国殖民军队和保大傀儡政权。法国殖民军队最近在北越的惨败，使美帝国主义者更加焦虑，并决定加紧运送杀人武器到越南去。据法新社火奴鲁鲁十六日讯：杜鲁门与麦克阿瑟最近在威克岛商议全面侵略亚洲的计划时，曾“决定加强运送武器及物资给法国和越南军队”。该消息并透露：五艘运送战争物资的船只，已在开往印度支那的途中。据合众社西贡十五日电称：“载运武器接济遭受重大压力的法越军队的美国货船一艘，十五日晚到达印度支那南部；第二艘货船将于周内载运新式武器抵西贡。”法新社华盛顿十四日消息：“美国将在数周内派遣相当于一分队的轻轰炸机与登陆艇往印度支那。美国国防部并将尽力加速运输关于这批援助的物资。”
    美帝国主义公开对越南法军与保大的大规模“援助”，早在今年一月美国“巡回大使”耶塞普到越南进行侵略活动后，就已开始。据法新社讯：援助总额决定为三千万美元左右。包括飞机、自动武器、水陆交通设备的首批军事“援助”，于七月起自美国启运。八月十日，装载美国“军援”的美轮“铁盗号”抵达西贡。至九月上旬，运抵印度支那的美国军火，已足够装备十二个摩托化营。
    美帝国主义军事“援助”的另一目标是在其直接控制下的菲律宾。美帝国主义在发动侵略朝鲜战争以后，至七月下旬止，运到菲律宾的“军援”物资已不下三批。根据“菲美国防互助计划”，九月二十日又有美国“军援”物资一百吨运抵菲律宾，其中包括装甲车、卡车、无线电装备等。迄九月中旬止，菲律宾已经收到价值二亿五千二百五十四万二千六百十四比索（二比索折合一美元）的美国军事“援助”。
    在梅尔拜率领的美国军事使团“访问”泰国之后，美帝国主义正在加紧武装銮披汶政府的军队。美国驻泰国大使史丹顿与泰国总理銮披汶已于十月十七日在曼谷签订了一项《军事援助协定》。该协定规定美国以武器和装备给予泰国，并“提供若干军官与技术人才”，训练泰国反动军队。銮披汶曾于九月二十日对曼谷论坛报记者说：美国将给泰国价值三千万美元的武器，可装备九营人。
