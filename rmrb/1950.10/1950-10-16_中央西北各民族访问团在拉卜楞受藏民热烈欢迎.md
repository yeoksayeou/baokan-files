The Tibetan people of the area held a grand meeting on the 22nd and 23rd to welcome the delegation. Men, women, old and young, all dressed in festive clothes. At the welcome meeting, Tibetan men performed excellent horsemanship, and women performed their ethnic dances and songs.

The Tibetan people of the Labrang area and the monks of the Labrang Monastery presented banners inscribed with "Savior of the Nation" and "Savior of the Tibetan People" to Chairman Mao, as well as valuable Tibetan specialties such as saffron, musk, and tiger skin.

During its stay in the area, the delegation conveyed the cordial greetings of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government to the Tibetan people in detail through mass meetings, symposiums, and individual visits.
