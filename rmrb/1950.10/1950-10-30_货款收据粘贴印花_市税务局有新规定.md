　　Stamp Duty on Receipts for Goods: New Regulations from the Municipal Tax Bureau
    Regarding the method of affixing stamp duty on "receipts for goods," the tax was previously levied at a rate of 3 per mille. In the Circular on Adjusting Taxes issued by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council on June 29 of this year, it was stipulated that: "All 'receipts for goods' with an amount of 15,000 yuan or more must be affixed with a stamp of 500 yuan." Since its implementation, this has reduced the stamp duty for receipts with amounts of 170,000 yuan or more, but has relatively increased the tax burden for amounts between 15,000 yuan and 170,000 yuan, which is unfair and unreasonable, and has been widely reflected by all parties. Now, with the approval of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council upon request from the Ministry of Finance and Economics, in order to implement the spirit of adjusting taxes and to ensure a fair tax burden for small-amount "receipts for goods," the following supplementary regulations are temporarily made before the promulgation of the new stamp duty regulations: (1) Receipts for goods with an amount of less than 15,000 yuan are exempt from stamp duty. (2) Receipts for goods with an amount of 15,000 yuan or more but less than 150,000 yuan must be affixed with a stamp of 200 yuan. (3) Receipts for goods with an amount of 150,000 yuan or more must be affixed with a stamp of 500 yuan. The Municipal Tax Bureau has recently received this notice and will begin to implement it immediately.

　　货款收据粘贴印花  市税务局有新规定
    关于“货款收据”粘贴印花的办法，过去系依千分之三税率计征，在本年六月二十九日政务院财经委员会调整税收通知中曾规定：凡“货款收据”所载金额满一万五千元者，一律贴花五百元。实行以来，对于金额在十七万元以上的收据是减轻了印花税，但对十七万元以下，一万五千元以上的金额，却相对地增加了，有失公平合理的原则，各方反映很多。现经中财部请准政务院财经委员会，为了贯彻调整税收精神，使小额“货款收据”税负公平起见，在印花税新条例未公布前，暂作以下补充规定：（一）货款收据金额未满一万五千元者免贴。（二）货款收据金额在一万五千元以上未满十五万元者，一律贴花二百元。（三）货款收据金额在十五万元以上者，一律贴花五百元。本市税务局顷已接到此项通知，并自即日起开始实行。
