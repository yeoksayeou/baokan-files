　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th: TASS reported: The third was the fifth anniversary of the founding of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Labor Newspaper published a commemorative article by Vittorio, Chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions, entitled "Guarding Peace, Democracy and the Vital Rights of the Working People," stating that the founding of the World Federation of Trade Unions was an important milestone in the history of the international workers' movement. The World Federation of Trade Unions was born out of the will and aspirations of millions of working people around the world. It is the only true international proletarian organization. Therefore, it represents an irresistible force, which grows stronger along with the rising tide and victory of the world proletariat in various countries. No conspiracy, intimidation, or high-pressure tactics can destroy the World Federation of Trade Unions, nor can they prevent it from leading the daily struggles of workers and trade unions around the world. Currently, trade unions from 56 countries have joined the World Federation of Trade Unions, representing more than 78 million organized workers.

　　Vittorio continued: The organized working-class movement must support the demands put forward by the World Federation of Trade Unions to stop the war of aggression against Korea and withdraw the U.S. troops that are invading Korea by all means, implement the resolutions of the Prague meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, resolutely demand the prohibition of atomic weapons, disarmament, opposition to aggression, opposition to armed intervention in the internal affairs of other countries, and the prohibition of war propaganda.

　　Vittorio concluded: In the face of the serious threat posed by American imperialism to mankind today, the World Federation of Trade Unions reiterates the unity, solidarity, and friendship of working people all over the world. Workers of all countries will unanimously oppose any attempt to launch a new war and resist any aggression against the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democracies.

　　Also reported: The All-Soviet Central Council of Trade Unions sent a telegram to Vittorio and World Federation of Trade Unions Secretary-General Saillant on the 2nd, congratulating them on the fifth anniversary of the founding of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

　　维多里奥在苏联劳动报撰文
    纪念世界工联成立五周年
    指出全世界劳动人民必将团结反对新战争
    【新华社六日讯】综合塔斯社莫斯科消息：三日为世界工会联合会成立五周年纪念日。劳动报刊载了世界工联主席维多里奥所撰题为“守护和平、民主与劳动人民的切身权利”的纪念专文称：世界工联的创立，是国际工人阶级运动史中的重要里程碑。世界工联是凭借全世界千百万劳动人民的意志和抱负而诞生的，它是唯一的、真正的国际无产阶级的组织，因此，它代表着不可抗的力量，这种力量随着世界无产阶级在各国中斗争的高涨和胜利而一齐成长加强，无论任何阴谋手段、威吓、高压，都不能破坏世界工联，也不能阻止它领导全世界工人与工会的日常斗争。现在加入了世界工联的已有五十六个国家的工会，它代表着七千八百余万有组织的职工。
    维多里奥继称：有组织的工人阶级运动，要用一切方法支持世界工联提出的停止侵略朝鲜战争及撤退侵略朝鲜美军的要求，贯彻世界拥护和平大会常设委员会执行局布拉格会议的决议，坚决要求禁止原子武器、裁减军备、反对侵略、反对武装干涉别国内政，禁止战争宣传。
    维多里奥在结语中说：世界工联在美国帝国主义对人类进行严重威胁的今天，重申全世界劳动人民的联合、团结和亲爱。各国工人必将一致反对发动新战争的任何企图，反抗对苏联、对中华人民共和国、以及对各人民民主国家的任何侵略。
    又讯：全苏工会中央理事会于二日致电维多里奥和世界工联总书记赛扬，祝贺世界工联成立五周年。
