　　Rectification in Xingtai Town, Hebei Province Achieves Results Through Inspection and Improvement

　　[Our Newspaper] In the rectification movement in Xingtai Town, Hebei Province, rectification has achieved certain results through inspecting and summarizing on one hand, and improving work on the other.

　　Before the rectification, the Coal and Iron Company was arrogant in its work and excluded private coal factories. In terms of price policy, the difference between retail and wholesale prices was small, leaving no legitimate profit for private merchants. Private merchants reflected, "The company has taken away our livelihood." This created a public-private opposition. After studying and inspecting, it was recognized that this view violated Article 26 of the Common Program, which stipulates: "...so that various social economic components, under the leadership of the state-owned economy, divide labor and cooperate, each getting its place, to promote the development of the entire social economy." The company immediately held a forum for private merchants, solicited their opinions on the company, reviewed the deviations in past work, eliminated misunderstandings, and established normal business relations. The private merchants were very satisfied. Originally, only one private coal factory had relations with the company, but now it has increased to four. In Dalian Town, twelve coal factories have established consignment relations with the company, and private merchants in Shahe and other places also want to establish business relations with the company. The town's cooperative reviewed its past purely profit-oriented views and incorrect relations with private merchants, and immediately made improvements. For example, it organized a salt sales team, coordinated with the salt company to hold a forum for private merchants, studied retail prices, and left a certain profit for private merchants. Small producers were all very happy.

　　After inspecting its work, the Electric Light Company systematically organized a comprehensive inspection of the town's lines, and immediately repaired dangerous power lines, poles, etc.

　　After the rectification, there have also been many improvements in the work style of cadres. Before the rectification, comrades in the retail department of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's business section had a bad attitude towards customers buying cloth and were unwilling to let people choose fabrics. After studying, the attitude towards customers has greatly changed. When the masses send cotton, sometimes it contains moisture and impurities. The comrades in the cotton thread section patiently explain to the masses the harm of adulterating impurities and moisture. The masses reflected, "The company cadres' work style has changed."

　　一面检查一面改进工作
    河北省邢台镇整风获得成效
    【本报讯】河北省邢台镇整风运动中，一面检查总结、一面改进工作，整风已收到一定成效。
    整风以前煤铁公司在工作中财大气粗，排斥私营煤炭厂。在价格政策上，零售与批发价差额小，没有给私商留出正当利润。私商反映“公司把我们的锅端了。”形成公私对立。经过学习检查，认识到这种观点是违犯共同纲领第二十六条所规定的：“……使各种社会经济成份在国营经济领导之下，分工合作，各得其所，以促进整个社会经济的发展。”公司随即召开了私商座谈会，征求了私商对公司的意见，检讨了过去工作中的偏差，消除了误会，并建立了正常的业务关系，私商均很满意。原来只有一户私商煤厂和公司有关系，现已增到四户，在褡裢镇已有十二家煤厂和公司建立了代销关系，沙河等地私商也要和公司建立业务关系。镇合作社对过去的单纯营利观点及对私商的不正确的关系等作了检查，随即进行改进。如组织了售盐小组，配合盐业公司召开了私商座谈会，研究了零售价格，给私商留出了一定的利润。小生产者都很高兴。
    电灯公司检查工作后，有计划的组织了全镇线路大检查，对有危险性的电线、电杆等随即作了修整。
    整风后干部作风方面也有不少改进。花纱布公司在整风前业务股门市部的同志们对待买布客商态度不好，不愿人家挑选布匹。经过学习，对顾客态度大有改变。群众送来的棉花，其中有时有水分和杂质，线棉股的同志就耐心向群众解释说明掺杂质水分的害处。群众反映说：“公司干部作风转变了。”
