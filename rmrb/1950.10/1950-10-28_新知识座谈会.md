New Knowledge Seminar

    The Beijing Branch of the China National Democratic Construction Association is sponsoring the 93rd New Knowledge Seminar, to be held at the Xiehe Auditorium on Dongdan Santiao at 7:00 pm today (the 28th). Because of the recent rapid developments in the international situation, especially the Korean issue and the United Nations issue, everyone is very concerned. Therefore, we have invited Mr. Ling Qihan, the former envoy to France who revolted and is now a special commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to give a systematic report to everyone. We hope that members, friends, and people from industry and commerce will actively participate.
