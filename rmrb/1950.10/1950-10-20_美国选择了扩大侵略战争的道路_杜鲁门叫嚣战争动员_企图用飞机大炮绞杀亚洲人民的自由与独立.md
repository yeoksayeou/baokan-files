　　America Chooses the Path of Expanding the War of Aggression
    Truman Calls for War Mobilization
    Attempting to Strangle the Freedom and Independence of the Asian People with Airplanes and Cannons
    [Xinhua News Agency, 19th] According to a United States Information Service dispatch from San Francisco: After US President Truman met with MacArthur on Wake Island, he delivered a speech in San Francisco on the 18th, further implementing war mobilization.
    In this lengthy speech, Truman made no secret of the fact that the American imperialists have chosen the path of expanding the war of aggression. After wantonly slandering the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, he declared that the United States "must meet strength with strength" and "build up armed forces strong enough." Truman said: "This is the choice we have made. We have made this choice firmly and resolutely."
    Truman's speech also showed that the United States has become a "militaristic country" that Truman vehemently denied. Truman said: "We must continue to increase our military production. We must continue to increase the strength of our armed forces—the Army, Navy, and Air Force. We must devote more of our resources to military uses and less to civilian consumption." But Truman had to admit: "All of this will be difficult."
    In his speech, Truman also called on all of America's puppet states to step up war preparations. Truman said: "This is not just the task of the United States alone, it is a task that needs to be jointly undertaken by all free nations (referring to America's puppet states)."
    Truman also used flowery words to deceive the Asian people, attempting to conceal his bandit-like face of expanding aggression throughout the Far East. Truman said extremely hypocritically that the United States "sympathizes with and will assist" the people of Asian countries in achieving and defending their "freedom and independence." But Truman then revealed the truth about America's "sympathy and assistance" for the freedom and independence of the Asian people. He said without reservation: "Our soldiers are fighting in Asia, helping a ... small country (referring to Korea) to achieve its freedom and independence." From this, people can know that Truman originally intended to strangle the freedom and independence of the Asian people with airplanes and cannons, just like in Korea.

　　美国选择了扩大侵略战争的道路
    杜鲁门叫嚣战争动员
    企图用飞机大炮绞杀亚洲人民的自由与独立
    【新华社十九日讯】据美国新闻处旧金山消息：美国总统杜鲁门与麦克阿瑟在威克岛举行会谈以后，于十八日在旧金山发表了一篇进一步实行战争动员的演说。
    杜鲁门在这篇冗长的演说中毫不掩饰地表明，美国帝国主义者已选择了扩大侵略战争的道路。他在肆意诽谤苏联和各人民民主国家之后扬言：美国“必须以实力来反对实力”，“建立足够强大的武装部队”。杜鲁门说：“这就是我们所做的选择。我们坚定而决然地做了这个选择。”
    杜鲁门的演说也表明，美国已成为杜鲁门所矢口否认的“军国主义的国家”。杜鲁门说：“我们必须继续增加我们的军用生产。我们必须继续增加我们的武装部队——海陆空军——的实力。我们必须把较多的我们的资源用于军事用途，把较少的资源用于民生消费。”但杜鲁门不得不承认：“所有这些都将是困难的”。
    杜鲁门在演说中要求所有美国的仆从国家也加紧战争准备。杜鲁门说：“这不单是美国一国的任务，这是需要所有自由国家（指美国的仆从国家）共同担负的任务。”
    杜鲁门还以花言巧语来欺骗亚洲人民，妄图掩饰其在整个远东扩大侵略的强盗面目。杜鲁门极端虚伪地说：美国“同情并且将协助”亚洲各国人民取得和保卫他们的“自由与独立”。但杜鲁门接着就露出了美国对亚洲人民自由与独立的“同情和协助”的真相。他毫不隐晦地说：“我们的兵士们正在亚洲作战，协助一个……小国（按指朝鲜）取得它的自由和独立。”人们从这里可以知道，原来杜鲁门企图像在朝鲜一样，用飞机、大炮来绞杀亚洲人民的自由与独立。
