　　Xinhua News Agency, October 28th: The All-China Democratic Women's Federation recently received an "Appeal to Women of the World" from the Women's International Democratic Federation. The appeal calls on women around the world to unite with all peace-loving people to oppose the instigators of wars of aggression, to oppose foreign armed interference in the internal affairs of nations, and acts of aggression involving the large-scale slaughter of peaceful residents; and calls on women of all countries to submit "peace mandates" to the representatives of their countries attending the Second World Peace Congress, to be presented at the congress, to demonstrate the firm will of women to defend peace. The full text of the appeal is as follows:

Women, Mothers, and Sisters of the World:

The tears of mothers who lost their sons in the Second World War have not yet dried, the wounds inflicted by the fascists have not yet healed, and a more terrible new war is already threatening us.

In Korea, American planes barbarously and indiscriminately bomb peaceful residents, destroying cities and villages, and massacring millions of children, women, and old people.

Truman and Churchill have openly declared that they will use the atomic bomb against all peoples.

Every woman who has a keen sense of all life feels in her heart that the danger of a Third World War looms over her children, her family, and her country.

We, representing eighty million women, remind women all over the world, regardless of political views or religious beliefs, of the great responsibility we bear in this grave moment to our children, our people, to humanity, and to history.

We appeal to the members of all women's organizations, to all parties, and to all women: your mother's heart should hear the cry of hundreds of millions of children to live on.

Let us turn the anxiety pressing down on us into direct action to defend peace!

The world is enthusiastically preparing for the Second World Peace Congress to be held in Britain from November 13th to 19th, which will be a historic stage in the struggle of all peoples for peace.

We mothers, who have nurtured life, should assume our responsibility in this great gathering.

Let us unite!

To demand the prohibition of atomic weapons, the control and general reduction of all armaments.

To condemn aggression and foreign armed interference in the internal affairs of nations, as well as the large-scale slaughter of peaceful residents.

Let us sign the Stockholm Appeal and ask others to sign it as well.

Women of the World!

Please participate in the preparation for the Second World Peace Congress. The Peace Congress represents the infinitely great power of all nations fighting to stop the spread of death, destruction, and hunger, to stop the slaughter of children, and the destruction of families.

In various gatherings in cities and villages—female workers, peasant women, female staff, housewives, intellectuals, and so on—submit mandates to your representatives to indicate the measures you wish to be taken to ensure peace. Announce these "peace mandates" at mass meetings where you elect your national delegation. They will be solemnly presented at the Second Congress as the will of women.

If the tremendous power of women all over the world, who make up half of all humanity, unites with all those who desire peace and rises up against the agitators, we will save our children and our countries from destruction.

Peace and life are in our hands. The war instigators are only a small handful, while we have gathered the strength of all nations.

Peace will surely triumph over war!

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Women's International Democratic Federation

　　国际民主妇联发出呼吁书
    号召全世界妇女反对侵略战争
    团结起来采取保卫和平的直接行动推动和平签名运动并参加二届和大
    【新华社二十八日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会最近收到国际民主妇女联合会寄来的“致全世界妇女的呼吁书”。呼吁书号召全世界的妇女与所有要求和平的人民团结起来，一致反对侵略战争的发动者，反对以外国武装干涉各民族内政以及大规模屠杀和平居民的侵略行为；并号召各国妇女提出“和平委托书”，交给本国出席第二届世界拥护和平大会的代表，在大会上提出，以表明妇女们对保卫和平的坚决的意愿。呼吁书全文如下：全世界的妇女、母亲和姊妹们：
    第二次大战中失掉了儿子的母亲们的泪痕未干，法西斯蒂造成的创伤尚未医复，更可怖的新战争已经在威胁着我们。
    在朝鲜，美国飞机野蛮地滥炸和平居民，摧毁了城市和乡村，屠杀了千千万万的儿童、妇女和老人。
    杜鲁门和邱吉尔公开宣称要使用原子弹来对付各族人民。
    对于一切生命都有着敏锐感觉的每一个妇女，心里都感觉到第三次大战的危险笼罩着她们的儿女、家庭和国家。
    我们代表着八千万妇女，向全世界的妇女、不分政见或宗教信仰，提醒我们在这严重时机对我们的孩子，我们的人民，对人类和对历史所负的重大责任。
    我们向一切妇女团体的会员们、向各党派和全体妇女发出号召，你们母亲的心应该听到亿万儿童要活下去的呼声。
    把紧压着我们的忧虑，变成保卫和平的直接行动吧！
    全世界正在热烈准备十一月十三日——十九日在英国召开的第二届世界拥护和平大会，它将是各族人民争取和平斗争中的一个历史性的阶段。
    我们母亲们，我们养育了生命，应当在这伟大的集会中担负起我们的责任。
    让我们团结起来！
    为了要求禁止原子武器，管制与普遍裁减一切军备。
    为了谴责侵略和外国武装干涉各民族的内政以及大规模屠杀和平居民。
    让我们在斯德哥尔摩呼吁书上签名，并请别人也来签名。
    全世界的妇女们！
    请参加准备第二届世界拥护和平大会，和平大会是代表各民族为阻止死亡、破坏、饥饿的传播者，阻止屠杀儿童，毁灭家庭而斗争的无限巨大的力量。
    在各城市和乡村中的女工、农妇、女职员、家庭妇女、知识分子等各种各样的集会中，向你们的代表们提出委托书，来表明你们希望为保证和平而采取的措施。把这些“和平委托书”在选举你们本国代表团的群众大会上加以公布。它们将作为妇女们的意愿，在第二届大会上郑重地提出来。
    如果占全人类半数的全世界妇女的巨大力量与所有要求和平的人团结一致，起来反对煽动者，我们将从毁灭中拯救我们的孩子和我们的国家。
    和平与生命都掌握在我们的手中。战争煽动者只有一小撮，而我们则集合了各民族的力量。
    和平定将战胜战争！
                            国际民主妇女联合会
